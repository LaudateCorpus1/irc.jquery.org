[03:17:51] <dimi1947> I am having a problem understanding a syntax,,,is it possible to declare a variable,then use a coma and then declare a function???
[03:18:57] <Python> Jquery for selenium locatore ?
[03:21:57] <localh0st> dimi1947: yes, you can do it in that way: var x = "a", a = function () { console.log("x"); }; console.log(x); a();
[03:22:36] <dimi1947> localh0st:got it,thanks
[03:24:51] <Python> how to use a html locatore as jQuery locatore in selenium?
[03:27:39] <dimi1947> check the groupHasCheckedBox function here https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/vpz8o60n/
[03:28:32] <dimi1947> is it necessary that the length property is attached to it since it is used in console.log afterwards
[03:28:34] <dimi1947> ???
[03:29:59] <dimi1947> of course in the length property in console.log I have to use ===0 ahain
[03:31:36] <dimi1947> no it does not work and I cannot understand why
[04:08:46] <FilipNortic_> dimi1947: have you checked what "this" is refering to inside your grouphascheckbox function
[04:55:19] <michael1234> anyone knows how to apply slide effect on query ui selectmenu in the newest version of jquery ui?
[04:56:07] <michael1234> probably the are no information on www connected with this topic
[04:58:20] <michael1234> currently I make double effect - one from library and the second from respondig to click event - this is not what I want
[05:03:46] <michael1234> anyone can see my messages?
[05:04:19] <michael1234> I use this room first time
[05:06:20] <pavonia> I can't
[05:07:25] <michael1234> I understand
[05:09:33] <michael1234> ok, is this place appriopriate for introducing my problem? for asking such questions?
[05:11:03] <pavonia> This channel is about jQuery and things related to it. If your problem is related to jQuery, this is the right place to ask
[05:14:15] <michael1234> ok, is there any chance anyone answer my question? Or - are there any "volunteer" who will supply me such knowledge?
[05:15:29] <michael1234> is such knowledge a secret?
[05:15:33] <michael1234> ;)
[05:18:36] <pavonia> What was your question?
[05:19:14] <michael1234> I am copying: "anyone knows how to apply slide effect on query ui selectmenu in the newest version of jquery ui?"
[05:19:52] <pavonia> No idea
[05:21:55] <michael1234> pavonia - thanks for interesting in my problem
[05:24:10] <moveax> michael1234: i don't use jquery ui, but it could help to provide a jsfiddle with your problem where you are showing what you try and how you tried to solve that
[05:24:23] <moveax> Paste code @ http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com
[05:24:49] <moveax> now no one sees what exactly you are trying to do
[05:25:07] <moveax> michael1234: https://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc/
[05:25:12] <moveax> that link could be helpfull too
[05:27:32] <michael1234> moveax - thanks for your suggestions
[05:32:45] <michael1234> moveax - https://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc/ - really, very useful pieces of advice
[05:33:34] <moveax> yeah, the irc crystal ball is out of order most of the time, so that is helping you to provide informations needed to get help
[05:34:36] <michael1234>  moveax - so far I have not use IRC for getting help for my work
[05:38:33] <moveax> stay in the channels that you visited and support back. most important, read the backlog from time to time and read up interesting topic, that helps to increase your dev-fu
[05:48:16] <michael1234> I use jquery ui 1.12.1 with selectmenu widget as well as slide effect included and downloaded. I apply this widget in pretty obvious way: $("#mySelect").selectmenu(); Next I try to apply slide effect in such a way: $("#mySelect-button").click(function() {$("#mySelect-menu").toggle("slide", {direction: "down"}, 500);}); When I click on selectmenu button, it does not work how I want, because ultimate effect in Web browser is somehow do
[05:48:16] <michael1234>  - one originating in library, a second originating in my code. Question: how to apply this effect on this widget in a single and normal way?
[06:07:05] <codecutter> noticed 'keypress' not triggered for 'delete' button
[06:07:20] <codecutter> is this the case?
[06:07:31] <Cork> no but it fires before the value is updated
[06:07:36] <Cork> you want the input event
[06:07:47] <Cork> also the keypress event is NOT standard
[06:08:11] <Cork> (opera used to not fire it)
[06:08:24] <Cork> before they moved to blink as the base of the browser
[06:10:47] <codecutter> ah
[06:14:21] <codecutter> Cork: i need to remove the 'heigh' and 'line-height' property once the cursor reaches the end of the (before scroll bar appears) else wont wrap onto the next line, how do i do this? https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/fddb8ezx/
[06:15:55] <Cork> you just want the field to expand or what?
[06:16:23] <codecutter> yes
[06:17:27] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/fddb8ezx/2/
[06:18:08] <Cork> something that handles removing too https://jsfiddle.net/fddb8ezx/3/
[06:20:25] <codecutter> can you reduce the space between each line a little?
[06:20:35] <Cork> remove the line-height
[06:20:44] <Cork> i would recommend not having it at all
[06:20:50] <Cork> set padding instead
[06:20:52] <codecutter> the place holder text wont be center vertically
[06:20:59] <codecutter> then*
[06:21:03] <Cork> set padding instead
[06:22:25] <codecutter> i didn't realise you could increase the size of the box dynamically like that elsewhere i'm using this to do it http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize/
[06:36:11] <codecutter> got disconnected
[06:36:13] <codecutter> i didn't realise you could increase the size of the box dynamically like that elsewhere i'm using this to do it http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize/
[06:50:55] <codecutter> Cork: text not centered https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/fddb8ezx/4/
[06:54:37] <codecutter> slightly centered but textarea looks too big
[06:55:45] <codecutter> nvm
[06:56:18] <codecutter> Cork: need to decrease the border radius once the cursor moves on to the next line.
[06:56:43] <codecutter> then add it back when there is only single line
[06:56:52] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/fddb8ezx/5/
[06:57:20] <codecutter> border radius with multiple lines should be 10px, single line 50px
[07:10:09] <codecutter> u there?
[07:17:02] <codecutter> Cork: talk to me
[07:17:09] <codecutter> sorry to be pushy
[07:17:15] <codecutter> :)
[07:17:21] <karstenk> Hello! Have this selector this.$('input[type="radio"][data-method]') an array of len 2, how ask if one is checked?
[07:20:55] <thykka> $('[type="radio"][data-method]').filter(':checked').length == 1
[07:26:24] <codecutter> sorted
[07:34:17] <Cork> karstenk: this.$('input[type="radio"][data-method]').is(':checked') ?
[07:34:53] <Cork> karstenk: this.$('input[type="radio"][data-method]:checked').length > 0 depending on what you want to do
[07:35:34] <Cork> (codecutter apparently haven't heard of lunch)
[10:16:02] <Levin^> hello there
[10:16:20] <Levin^> I need a clarification
[10:16:48] <Levin^> if you enter at this page: http://teste.lojaodobras.com.br/loja/bras-i/
[10:17:03] <Levin^> you're going to see a secondary meny in red
[10:17:06] <Levin^> menu*
[10:17:42] <Levin^> so, if you scroll the window up and down fast enough, that menu will present a positioning bug
[10:18:22] <Levin^> (this website's layout comes from a wordpress theme)
[10:19:20] <Levin^> so, to fix this bug, I thought on creating a conditional code, where, if the menu is not at the top at a certain moment, it must go the top again
[10:20:02] <Levin^> my question is: is this a good practice? and: is it a good idea to use jquery for this?
[10:21:25] <taplar> does the existing scroll logic use any form of throttling/debouncing?
[10:23:45] <Levin^> this is something to investigate
[10:24:45] <taplar> cause you issue revolves around "scrolling too fast" which would suggest that you are not
[10:29:04] <EdwardIII> hey. i'm pulling in a some html via 3-4 jQuery get calls. i have a $.when(allThePromisesFromThoseCalls).then(finishShowingSpinners) but it seems to fire wayyyy too early
[10:29:27] <EdwardIII> maybe it's firing when network has finished but before render happens?
[10:30:08] <taplar> "render" being?
[10:30:51] <EdwardIII> turning the flat html into DOM elements then adding them into the DOM
[10:31:09] <taplar> is that done in each of the promises themselves?
[10:31:32] <EdwardIII> yes
[10:32:27] <EdwardIII> like this: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/87de703e616bffb587c0bdb2f8f60463
[10:32:30] <EdwardIII> sorry for the coffeescript
[10:32:38] <taplar> Hmm, dunno, I'd assume that the success methods of the ajax calls would get a shot to execute before the outer then() executes for all of them, but it's possible that that logic is being allowed to run before the browser redraws.
[10:33:13] <EdwardIII> time to liberally pepper setTimeout everywhere?
[10:33:43] <taplar> i'd have to ask why it's an issue that the browser must redraw before your logic executes
[10:34:14] <EdwardIII> you mean an issue for me?
[10:34:18] <taplar> yep
[10:35:01] <EdwardIII> i don't mind - the problem is that it hides the spinner before the new content is ready - sometimes for quite a long time it's ready
[10:35:10] <EdwardIII> *quite a long time BEFORE it's ready
[10:35:44] <EdwardIII> in fact it's a bit suspiciously long
[10:35:46] <taplar> in that case i might suggest another option
[10:35:58] <EdwardIII> when doesn't fire until ALL promises have finished, right?
[10:36:02] <shoky> EdwardIII: you need $.when.apply($, promises)
[10:36:12] <EdwardIII> oh?
[10:36:22] <shoky> yes. $.when accepts only individual promises as arguments
[10:36:25] <shoky> not an array
[10:36:34] <taplar> ah, true
[10:37:05] <EdwardIII> hmm crap
[10:37:23] <EdwardIII> so when is resolving immediately and it's nothing to do with network/rendering
[10:37:30] <shoky> yup
[10:37:37] <EdwardIII> is there something like Promise.all in jquery?
[10:37:44] <taplar> that's what when is
[10:37:45] <shoky> what i just said :P
[10:38:06] <EdwardIII> ah sorry i misunderstood
[10:38:12] <shoky> though with jq 3 i suppose you can just use Promise.all
[10:38:12] <taplar> It's just the format of $.when, as shoky pointed out, is $.when(promise1, promise2, ...)
[10:39:04] <EdwardIII> excellent
[10:39:14] <EdwardIII> thanks both, sorry for the stupidity
[10:39:39] <taplar> nah, i'm glad shoky caught that.  i was fixing to go with some crazy idea, :)
[10:40:02] <shoky> lul
[11:16:09] <michael1234> I'm trying to make working slide effect with jquery ui selectmenu by this code:
[11:16:09] <michael1234> $("#mySelect").selectmenu();  //initialization
[11:16:10] <michael1234> $("#mySelect").selectmenu("option", "show",
[11:16:10] <michael1234> {effect: "slide", duration: 600, direction: "down"});   //setting (not starting) an effect
[11:16:10] <michael1234> ...but also it doesn't work - menu appears immediately, without an animation.
[11:16:10] <michael1234> Does anyone knows what is wrong?
[11:16:10] <michael1234> I do things according to this documentation:
[11:16:11] <michael1234> https://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[11:16:11] <michael1234> Instead of general method called "widget()", I use "selectmenu()" one.
[11:19:53] <shoky> michael1234: selectmenu doesn't have a "show" option   https://api.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[11:22:04] <michael1234> shoky - so how to make an effect, for example, slide one, on selectmenu?
[11:23:32] <michael1234> Is any effect, any animation, possible on this widget, at all?
[11:25:20] <thykka> yes, it's possible
[11:25:35] <thykka> but it would need quite a bit of tweaking
[11:26:33] <thykka> the way the menu works by default, is that .ui-selectmenu-menu has display: none; initially, which then gets a class .ui-selectmenu-open, which overwrites the display rule with "block", causing it's contents to become visible
[11:27:44] <thykka> to animate it, you'd want to transition the height of it's child; .ui-menu, as well as ensure that .ui-selectmenu-menu isn't display: none; while it's animating
[11:28:51] <thykka> the most straightforward way would be to trigger a height transition on .ui-menu as the menu is opened or closed, and delay hiding .ui-selectmenu-menu until the transition has completed
[11:30:08] <thykka> one issue with this is that animating height causes repaints and possibly reflows too, so it might not be 60fps
[11:30:16] <Neo1> I'll create chat...
[11:30:33] <Neo1> have already registered domain http://yoineer.com/8cE7
[11:30:39] <michael1234> thykka - transition? You mean CSS3 transition property?
[11:30:51] <thykka> michael1234, right
[11:31:10] <thykka> michael1234, i mean, sure, you could animate with JS, but CSS animations are generally more performant
[11:34:47] <michael1234> thykka - so there is no way to do this by library, in "clean" way? We have to do this manually?
[11:35:06] <thykka> dude, you're working with a jQuery plugin and worried about cleanliness ;)
[11:35:14] <thykka> there's irony in there
[11:35:47] <grapheti> haha
[11:36:05] <thykka> but no, as you can see from it's documentation, it doesn't offer animation capabilities as-is
[11:36:25] <michael1234> yeah, my theming probably is not so clean
[11:42:25] <michael1234> thykka - thanks a lot; beside: Probably I have to create my own library for such occasions (like HTML ugly <select>), and my library will predict every case, and everyone will be able to do everyting in a clean way :P
[13:52:22] <stan_man_can> Anyone familiar with select2? I have multiple select2 inputs on a page and I'm curious how I can find attributes of the input when it's opened. $("#locations").on('select2:open', function(e) { console.log($(this)); } doesn't seem to reference the actual select2 input
[13:53:30] <taplar> That logic is supossed to affect multiple select2 elements?
[13:54:08] <stan_man_can> taplar: no, just to point out that $(this) doesn't seem to reference the actual input you click on, i'm not sure if the html select and the select2 inputs are different?
[13:54:21] <taplar> yep
[13:54:47] <taplar> select2 creates it's own structure in the dom because the native select can't handle all the things it is providing extra
[13:54:59] <stan_man_can> gotcha, and that makes sense
[13:55:19] <stan_man_can> so how would I go about select the select2 elements when it's opened?
[13:55:28] <stan_man_can> i can't find anything in the docs about how to reference it
[13:55:39] <taplar> got the link for the docs on ya?
[13:55:55] <stan_man_can> https://select2.org/programmatic-control/events
[13:56:38] <taplar> var data = e.params.data;  <-- have you tried looking at that guy?
[13:59:37] <stan_man_can> yeah, couldn't find a reference to the new element though, just lots of references to the original one
[13:59:53] <taplar> 'new' element?
[14:02:52] <taplar> you lost me with 'new element' since you are binding on 'select2:open'
[14:02:54] <stan_man_can> the one select2 generates
[14:03:27] <stan_man_can> nevermind, apparently i'm unable to articulate my question accurately so i won't waste your time further, sorry for the bother
[14:03:50] <taplar> are the options generated every time it opens?
[14:17:54] <codecutter> how do i prevent the textarea cursor from moving onto next line on return btn?
[14:18:28] <taplar> you can catch the enter key on keydown and cancel the event
[14:18:46] <codecutter> you mean the code?
[14:19:06] <taplar> you would check the code to see if it was the enter key as part of that logic
[14:19:31] <codecutter> do you know the return code?
[14:19:44] <taplar> 13 or 10 iirc
[14:19:52] <codecutter> how would i cancel it?
[14:20:04] <taplar> e.preventDefault() like normal
[14:20:15] <codecutter> i tried that on keyup
[14:20:24] <taplar> you have to do it on key down
[14:20:35] <codecutter> that explains it
[14:20:39] <taplar> by the time that the event cycles to keyup, the value has changed already
[14:20:53] <codecutter> gotcha
[14:21:49] <codecutter> i'm also submitting the form upon press of 'utrn button (keyup)
[14:21:59] <codecutter> that complicates things a little right
[14:22:05] <codecutter> ?
[14:22:19] <taplar> yep, that would prevent the submit that way
[14:22:39] <taplar> however, you could cancel the event and then manually trigger the submit
[14:22:46] <codecutter> when return is pressed it needs to submit the form without cursor going to next line
[14:22:55] <codecutter> i see
[14:45:35] <dimi1947> take a look this fiddle at line 78 or 83...what i,e in the parentheses mean?someone gave me that code and I am trying to understand it...
[14:46:04] * robertmaxrees waits for link
[14:46:08] * taplar ^
[14:46:23] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 hard for us to look at a fiddle you don't link us to it ;)
[14:47:35] <taplar> would be pretty big brother of us
[14:47:56] <dimi1947> sorry https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/q4uy6p44/212/
[14:48:20] <taplar> ah, arrow functions
[14:48:28] <taplar> (i, e) => {}
[14:48:38] <Uhkis> *barf*
[14:48:44] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 well.
[14:48:44] <taplar> that's making an anonymous method that takes in two inputs
[14:48:44] <taplar> index and element
[14:48:50] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy to figure out on your own :)
[14:49:25] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 http://api.jquery.com/filter/#filter-function
[14:49:36] <taplar> ah man, Uhkis made me think of original south park
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> see where it says "Type: Function( Integer index, Element element ) => Boolean" ?
[14:51:45] * robertmaxrees listens to the jeopardy music
[14:52:10] <taplar> do you do the duck move to it?
[14:52:25] <dimi1947> I am trying to understand what the manual says
[14:53:07] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 https://i.imgur.com/IYKvVC2.png see this part?
[14:53:28] <dimi1947> I am seeing that...
[14:54:08] <robertmaxrees> so you see how it says "Function( Integer index, Element element )"
[14:54:11] <robertmaxrees> right?
[14:56:20] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what that means is it can take a function with two args.  the first is the index, the second is the element.
[14:56:30] <dimi1947> yes I do see that but I cannot understand what is the purpose of it
[14:56:38] <robertmaxrees> just explained it :)
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> you can name those args anything you want, but under the hood, jquery will pass those two things.
[14:57:06] <dimi1947> hmmm
[14:57:19] <robertmaxrees> make sense?  or are you lost?
[14:57:38] <dimi1947> I am thinking about it...give me some time
[14:58:07] <robertmaxrees> aight.
[14:58:41] * taplar hums the be alive song
[14:59:07] <dimi1947> first question...are they really necessary...can I omit them?
[14:59:19] <robertmaxrees> well.
[14:59:21] <robertmaxrees> not in your case.
[14:59:28] <robertmaxrees> because you need a reference to those args.
[14:59:36] <robertmaxrees> if you omit them, they don't get passed in.
[14:59:46] <robertmaxrees> rather, the function has no name for them.
[15:00:14] <dimi1947> ok...
[15:00:34] <dimi1947> one be one...what is the purpose of index?
[15:00:34] <taplar> heh, i started to mention 'this' but, fkn arrow
[15:00:53] <robertmaxrees> since the order of arguments is important, you have to pass both index and element in to have access to element./
[15:01:23] <robertmaxrees> and since it's a fat arrow, you can't use 'this' because fat arrows can't be bound the way you need them to for that to work.
[15:02:24] <dimi1947> do not continue,I have question and I am stryggling to keep up
[15:02:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:02:34] <robertmaxrees> k
[15:02:46] <dimi1947> k=ok?
[15:02:50] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:03:08] <dimi1947> so...
[15:03:26] <dimi1947> i and e are needed by jquery to access the element???
[15:03:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:03:43] <dimi1947> ?
[15:03:49] <robertmaxrees> i and e are needed by your function to access the element.
[15:03:54] <robertmaxrees> jquery just passes those in.
[15:04:06] <robertmaxrees> it's up to you to name them.
[15:04:26] <taplar> hmm, i've never thought about if arrow functions have the arguments variable
[15:05:33] <robertmaxrees> they don't.,
[15:06:17] <dimi1947> just a moment cause I am confused...
[15:06:23] <robertmaxrees> taplar https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
[15:06:25] <taplar> dang
[15:06:54] <robertmaxrees> people love to abuse them, toio.
[15:06:56] <robertmaxrees> *too
[15:07:25] <taplar> i think most are after the less typing and not aware of the side effects
[15:07:38] <dimi1947> you say that the function needs these to access the elements and not jquery...correct?
[15:07:38] <robertmaxrees> and also the "ooh shiny" effect.
[15:07:45] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 correct.
[15:08:24] <dimi1947> yes but the function is jquery code anyway.why you are trying to distinguish one from the other
[15:08:26] <dimi1947> ???
[15:08:38] <robertmaxrees> no, the function is not jquery code.
[15:08:40] <robertmaxrees> jquery is javascript.
[15:08:59] <dimi1947> hmmm
[15:09:18] <dimi1947> the function is also javascript
[15:09:26] <taplar> yup
[15:09:36] <taplar> it's all javascript
[15:09:47] <robertmaxrees> one serc.
[15:09:50] <robertmaxrees> *sec
[15:09:58] <dimi1947> from all the things I heard this was the easiest
[15:10:03] <dimi1947> lol
[15:10:18] <robertmaxrees> what is the easiest?
[15:10:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery?
[15:10:29] <dimi1947> that everything is JS
[15:10:44] <robertmaxrees> ... still lost.
[15:10:45] <robertmaxrees> either way - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vead8r71/
[15:11:00] <dimi1947> no I am not lost...
[15:11:04] <taplar> Think of it like this dimi
[15:11:14] <dimi1947> I am in a good path
[15:11:16] <taplar> Say someone walks up to you and says, "your dimi"
[15:11:20] <taplar> that's right, right?
[15:11:46] <taplar> Now say you're holding an umbrella or something
[15:12:01] <taplar> and someone walks up to you, points at the umbrella and says, "that's dimi"
[15:12:07] <dimi1947> give me 5 minutes please...I have to go to the bathroom
[15:12:35] * taplar starts the clock
[15:13:02] <taplar> trying to figure if this is a good analogy but i think it'll work
[15:14:52] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:15:13] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i was saying I'm lost.
[15:15:23] <taplar> dang
[15:17:05] <taplar> maybe i should go with a 2x4 and a house
[15:17:12] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:21:27] <dimi1947> so the function needs i and e to access the element...and that is because the function is not jquery...correct?
[15:21:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:21:48] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the fiddle i pasted?
[15:22:04] <taplar> by it's definition, filter() will pass the index and the element to the function you give it
[15:22:32] <robertmaxrees> you're probably used to seeing people use $(this) within functions passed to jquery methods, right?
[15:22:33] <dimi1947> I am seeing this now and I observe there is no i,e
[15:22:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:22:44] <taplar> if the function accepts them, or uses them, is entirely up to the function
[15:23:13] <robertmaxrees> so when you use function() {}, you can just use $(this).  but with arrow functions () => {}, $(this) isn't the element.
[15:23:18] <dimi1947> in what country are you and what time is it now?
[15:23:21] <robertmaxrees> so you have to explicitly pass in those arguments.
[15:23:53] <robertmaxrees> uh, it's 12:30 here on the west coast of the US.
[15:24:23] <dimi1947> I am starting to get tired...unfortunately....12:30PM or AM?
[15:24:29] <robertmaxrees> pm...
[15:24:35] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[15:24:55] <robertmaxrees> taplar i think i figured out why there's so much cognitive overload when it comes to people "getting" this kind of stuff.
[15:25:19] <taplar> and my two hours east of that liberal heathen
[15:25:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:25:40] <taplar> what?
[15:25:51] <dimi1947> because if it still day there you will not have problem continuing....in contrast with me...the discussion is extremely ineresting but I do not know how longI will be able to keep up
[15:26:34] <taplar> i can't understand your large words behind my chicken leg
[15:26:57] <dimi1947> I cannot continue sorry...I hope we can continue tommorow...I can barely type
[15:27:01] <robertmaxrees> taplar because it's /really hard/ to understand callbacks and functions as arguments unless you start from the beginning.
[15:27:17] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 can't speak for anybody else but I more than likely won't be on.
[15:27:26] <robertmaxrees> you should check out learn.jquery.com though
[15:27:33] <robertmaxrees> and other tutorials.
[15:28:00] <dimi1947> when you will be on-line again...you explain it very well
[15:28:08] <dimi1947> Monday???
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:28:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:28:37] <dimi1947> ok...then
[15:29:02] <taplar> did something happen to me because i said liberal heathen?
[15:29:12] <dimi1947> I hope you remember the topic
[15:29:16] <robertmaxrees> *hissssssssssssss*
[15:29:32] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 hahaha, you'll just have to ask on monday.   i probably won't hahahaha
[15:29:38] <dimi1947> sorry...but I am ready to fall into bed...
[15:29:43] <taplar> it was followed by "barjavel.freenode.net set mode +o ChanServ" and then saying my nick is registered.
[15:29:54] <taplar> don't hate me ChanServ!  I love robert!
[15:30:09] <dimi1947> gnight
[15:30:34] <grapheti> dam, it was anarchy for short amount of time :/
[15:34:16] <poboy> Hey, I'm trying make a dropdown readonly if var scanned = 'Yes'.  This is making the dropdown readonly regardless of value.  https://jsfiddle.net/4ocdqv6z/1/
[15:34:30] <poboy> What should I change?
[15:35:07] * taplar kneels to chanserv so she doesn't drop his connection again
[15:37:03] <Levin^> hang in there
[15:37:48] <taplar> can you repeat the question poboy?
[15:38:32] <poboy> how do I disable the 2nd dropdown only if the value of the 1st dropdown is "Yes"?  https://jsfiddle.net/4ocdqv6z/1/
[15:39:13] <taplar> you don't really need to do the scanned part
[15:39:23] <taplar> just check 'this.value' against Yes
[15:39:28] <poboy> and once that is working, I also need to clear the value of the 2nd dropdown if it's set
[15:40:18] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4ocdqv6z/2/
[15:42:09] <poboy> thanks.
