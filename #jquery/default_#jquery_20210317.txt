[11:52:04] <impliednude> I have a list of element within a wrapper. I need to append using jquery as follows. nth-of-item 1 append html, nth of 2, 3, etc..
[11:52:16] <impliednude> also, hi hi everyone
[11:53:00] <impliednude> elements*
[11:53:25] <impliednude> or I need to replace the url with a different one
[11:54:17] <impliednude> right now the elements point to an image.
[11:54:56] <impliednude> before you ask: I can't directly modify the js beforehand -sighs-
[13:04:54] <impliednude> lets say I have a whole bunch of img.examples and its under .wrapper but in individual div's. how can I Target it with nth-of-type
[13:05:05] <impliednude> img.examples that is
[13:08:50] <robertmaxrees> impliednude you're much more likely to get help if you make a jsfiddle :)
[13:13:13] <robertmaxrees> impliednude also: why use nth-of-type in this case?  why not pull out the swiss army knife of element targeting: .filter(function) ? :)
[13:16:32] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> its back to working in jsfiddle and not in my development department
[13:16:41] <impliednude> department = environment
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> "it's back to working" wat
[13:17:17] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you skipped something lol
[13:20:00] <impliednude> its working on jsfiddle but not on my dev env.
[13:20:52] <robertmaxrees> i gathered that.  when you said "its back to working", i don't recall you saying it did or didn't work in either environment lol.  feels like we're missing some context.
[13:21:22] <impliednude> works for the first element, not if I Add it to the 3rd.
[13:21:23] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/4atw79vz/
[13:22:08] <impliednude> So, on jsfiddle I am targetting nth-of-type. the first element it works. the 3rd element it isn't.
[13:22:13] <robertmaxrees> might want to start with valid markup for your wrap :)
[13:23:48] <impliednude> hmmm?
[13:23:54] <impliednude>  jQuery(".wp-slider-img:nth-of-type(3)").wrap("<a href=\"#example3\"><a/>"); is valid isn't it
[13:24:06] <robertmaxrees> <a/> isn't a valid closing tag.
[13:25:13] <impliednude> right
[13:25:20] <robertmaxrees> so fix that :)
[13:25:30] <robertmaxrees> also: the nth-of-type for the second element changes when you modify the first element.
[13:25:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/Lzjfpubt/1/ going to guess you want something like this instead.
[13:28:55] <impliednude> weirdly, its now working in jsfiddle but in wp dev. its still duplicating to all slides as the 1st one
[13:33:56] <impliednude> okay, got it
[13:34:05] <impliednude> had to go higher -ughhhh-
[13:35:25] <impliednude> I am such a newbie
[13:35:30] <robertmaxrees> all good :)
