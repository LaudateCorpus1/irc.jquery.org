[00:02:29] <coldhead> it returns the innerHTML
[00:04:47] <quuxman> that's not a DocumentFragment!
[00:05:00] <quuxman> that's a jquery object
[00:05:19] <coldhead> oh, you didn't say
[00:05:30] <coldhead> or maybe you did, i wasn't paying much attention
[00:05:33] <coldhead> i'm quite drunk
[00:05:39] <coldhead> and it's my first day using jQuery
[00:05:50] <quuxman> I mean DocumentFragment, with a capitol D and F
[00:05:59] <quuxman> (they're bitches)
[00:06:06] <coldhead> ya i feel ya
[00:06:29] <quuxman> I think I have to make my own HTML serializer
[00:07:50] <dannN> Hi, is it possible to add an beforeSend function in $.ajax after I had defined another function in $.ajaxSetup? Or does jQuery always override the beforeSend function from ajaxSetup?
[00:09:22] <quuxman> ah there is an easier way. document.createElement('div').append(fragment).innerHTML
[00:09:36] <rob43> I have a dynamically created group of radio buttons and everything seems to work, however when one gets checked, the checked="checked" attribute isn't being set on it, and remains on the original radio input.. any idea?
[00:10:57] <quuxman> yay!
[00:10:58] <coldhead> oh good thinking, quuxman
[00:11:08] <coldhead> i guess that's why jQuery doesn't bother to support them natively
[00:11:16] <quuxman> coldhead: (not my thinking, StackOverflow)
[00:11:24] <coldhead> pfft
[00:11:30] <coldhead> i don't recognise SO
[00:11:34] <coldhead> this is your own cleverness
[00:11:37] <quuxman> ;)
[00:13:14] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. I have a div with an anchor link that I want to scroll to.. The problem is that offset().top() takes the element's position relative to the document - not the div. So it scrolls too much.. See this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/RyTpV/
[00:13:20] <jaffipaffi> Does anyone know how to fix that?
[00:13:31] <jaffipaffi> It should actually scroll to <a name="scrollToNote" id="scrollToNote"></a>
[00:14:22] <D4> Calling $('<img src="img/01.jpg"/>'); would "preload" the image?
[00:16:58] <quuxman> jaffipaffi: $("#scrollToNote").get(0).offsetTop //?
[00:17:18] <coldhead> D4: yes
[00:17:26] <coldhead> but more generally, try it and see :P
[00:17:33] <quuxman> nevermind
[00:19:02] <D4> coldhead » It seemed too good to be true ;p How would I handle multiple images? Something like.. var myImages = [ 'myImage1.jpg', 'myImage2.png' ]; and then.. uh, $(myImages).each( function() { something } );
[00:19:25] <quuxman> jaffipaffi: yeah, offsetTop is what you want, but for some reason that's still making it scroll too much
[00:20:54] <coldhead> var img = new Image(); $(myImages).each( function(i, e) { img.src = e; } );
[00:22:23] <D4> coldhead » How'd I define the specific images? Or does that preload every image?
[00:24:25] <dannN> How can i pass an var with HTML content to jQuery and get out the content of <body>?
[00:24:47] <coldhead> D4:  that will preload the images in the array
[00:24:53] <coldhead> which you mentioned
[00:25:00] <coldhead> assuming they're URLs to the images
[00:25:11] <D4> oh, "myImages" != "img" sorry, thank you.. they have to be valid SRC values then?
[00:25:17] <coldhead> yes
[00:25:23] <coldhead> that's what's expected
[00:25:26] <D4> Thanks a lot, will try it out
[00:25:47] <coldhead> dannN: $(somevar).find('body').html();
[00:26:06] <coldhead> it might depend exactly what's in somevar
[00:26:15] <coldhead> you might need to experiment
[00:26:18] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[00:26:38] <dannN> coldhead: the somevar has as content an whole HTML5 document
[00:27:59] <coldhead> i'd expect that to work
[00:28:11] <coldhead> but i'd check before shipping it to production and going away for a month
[00:28:46] <dannN> I've have an html5 document stored in a string. now i want to get the whole content of <body> with js and jquery. But $(somevar).find('body') does not work
[00:28:58] <coldhead> goddamn
[00:29:08] <coldhead> let me experiment
[00:29:10] <peiper> give the body an ID or class to use
[00:29:18] <coldhead> i mean with your code, not sexually
[00:29:27] <dannN> peiper: can't
[00:30:36] <peiper> dannN you got an html5 document in a string? javascript String.Split function?
[00:31:03] <coldhead> dannN: i'm getting decent results with $(somevar).html()
[00:31:08] <coldhead> it dumps the body
[00:31:29] <dannN> on ajax.error i get an html5 document with jqXHR.responseText. Because i don't need the whole responseText i want to rip out the body
[00:33:00] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/v2pZL/
[00:33:06] <coldhead> works for me
[00:33:41] <coldhead> oh wait, that fucks up for multiple elems >: |
[00:36:13] <coldhead> Dinoire's dog "chewed her face after she passed out from an overdose of sleeping pills."
[00:36:15] <coldhead> never forget
[00:37:01] <dannN> ok, one problem is, i've to remove the \n
[00:39:44] <peiper> dannN javascript String.Replace
[00:39:50] <Cork> dannN: can't you make the server send you something better then a html document?
[00:40:02] <dannN> Cork: No, thats the problem
[00:40:08] <Cork> ouch
[00:40:35] <Cork> dannN: .text() should clean up the text nicly
[00:42:35] <coldhead> why don't you just include all possible strings in your code
[00:42:37] <Woet> dannN: why not?
[00:42:45] <coldhead> and then use some kind of program to pick the right onw
[00:42:46] <coldhead> one*
[00:42:54] <peiper> someone experienced with DataTables ? I added a div called config to the sDom which is just an image (CSS) i want to give it an .on("click") now but it wont work because the div's are created later then document.ready
[00:43:15] <dannN> with text() i've the text only, but i need the content of <body>
[00:43:35] <Cork> $(k).filter('body')
[00:43:46] <Cork> or rather
[00:43:49] <Cork> $(k).filter('body').text()
[00:43:55] <coldhead> doesn't work
[00:43:55] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[00:44:03] <dannN> http://jsfiddle.net/Vu3zf/
[00:44:06] <coldhead> you can't have more than one <body>
[00:44:09] <coldhead> it drops it
[00:44:15] <coldhead> its the saddest thing
[00:44:23] <serdem> peiper, i didn't uderstand your question. but if the div is creating later then the document ready , you can se livequery
[00:44:25] <Woet> dannN: why can't you make the server send you proper output?
[00:44:33] <serdem> se* use
[00:44:43] <dannN> Woet: Because the output comes from the CMS
[00:44:47] <peiper> serdem, livequery?!
[00:44:57] <Woet> dannN: and since when can CMSes not be edited?
[00:45:30] <dannN> Woet: It can, but i don't want to create a solution the customer have to edit the template before.
[00:45:40] <coldhead> Woet: since you lose the password
[00:45:41] <Woet> dannN: what are you trying to do?
[00:46:00] <serdem> peiper, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[00:46:37] <serdem> peiper, or just http://api.jquery.com/live/
[00:46:48] <peiper> thanks ill give it a tr
[00:46:48] <peiper> y
[00:46:59] <dannN> Woet: I get an HTML document back on ajax.error. This html data is stored in jqXHR.responseText by default. Now i want to get out the <body> content and display it
[00:47:19] <serdem> peiper, inform me after trying please.
[00:47:20] <Woet> dannN: yes, I know that. what are you actually trying to do, instead of the solution you came up with?
[00:49:06] <peiper> serdem, .live() didn't work ill give the livequery plugin a try
[00:54:15] <dannN> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/Vu3zf/1/
[00:54:33] <Woet> still not seeing what you are trying to do, dannN
[00:55:07] <dannN> I already said what  I want to do. I want to get the content of <body> from var response.
[00:55:24] <dannN> With HTML tags.
[00:55:29] <Woet> no, that's the solution you came up with
[00:56:12] <dannN> Ther solution i came up with doesn't work, like you can see in the fiddle
[00:56:22] <Woet> exactly, which is why I'm asking you, what are you trying to do
[00:57:21] <dannN> I think my english isn't good enough to know what I should answer you.
[00:58:41] <Woet> what are you building that makes you think you should get the <body> from the response?\
[00:59:24] <dannN> I add the <body> content to an self-written lightbox if ajax returns an error.
[01:02:52] <peiper> serdem, livequery worked! thank you!
[01:03:26] <serdem> peiper, live should work too. you sholdn't have to use plugin.
[01:03:35] <serdem> try it again.
[01:03:42] <serdem> np btw.

[01:20:35] <Cork> solved it a bit too late though :)
[01:21:09] <coldhead> holy shit, document.implementation?
[01:21:14] <coldhead> what kind of voodoo is this
[01:21:15] <Cork> yup
[01:21:22] <Cork> nothing new
[01:21:33] <Cork> createHTMLDocument was what i failed at
[01:21:33] <coldhead> next time someone asks about anything crazy i am just going to send them your way
[01:21:40] <Cork> used createDocument first
[01:21:50] <Cork> :D
[01:21:56] <coldhead> look sunshine, i've been using jQuery ALL DAY and i've never seen no document.implementation
[01:22:06] <coldhead> you got it for next time anyway
[01:22:08] <coldhead> very cool
[01:22:11] <Cork> its dom not jquery :)
[01:22:23] <AdvoWork> if ive got an input field, and need to have it hidden, whats the best way to hide this (display:none, visibility:hidden; so that I can still access the element?
[01:22:38] <coldhead> do i look too stupid to know the difference Cork?
[01:22:43] <coldhead> wait. don't answer that
[01:22:50] <Cork> lol
[01:23:00] <Cork> no, i didn't mean it like that :)
[01:23:16] <coldhead> AdvoWork: visibility: hidden preserves space for it on the page
[01:23:21] <coldhead> if that's important to you

[01:26:44] <Dame> $(div).scrollTo(p1, 800); <<code
[01:27:10] <Dame> what does the 800 stand for?
[01:28:00] <coldhead> pixels

[01:30:44] <murr4y> there's no click event in opera when you click and drag a portion of text :( http://jsfiddle.net/4yNxs/

[01:31:08] <coldhead> that must be very annoying to the 5 opera users in the world :(
[01:31:15] <coldhead> oh wait, divya has gone to adobe
[01:31:18] <coldhead> 4 opera users
[01:31:25] <murr4y> lol
[01:31:44] <Cork> :D
[01:31:56] <coldhead> murr4y: if its not too urgent ask miketaylr when he's online
[01:32:03] <coldhead> it's his job to fix stuff like that for you
[01:32:19] <murr4y> aha
[01:32:23] <coldhead> he's in texas if you want to check the timezones
[01:32:26] <Cork> coldhead: you've missed all of russia
[01:32:33] <Cork> they'r cracy about opera
[01:32:43] <coldhead> in soviet russia opera uses YOU
[01:32:57] <Cork> (every russian i personally know use opera as there primary browser)
[01:33:10] <coldhead> i really only make fun of opera because i know people who work there
[01:33:23] <coldhead> and because i'm drunk and belligerent
[01:33:24] <Cork> cool
[01:33:29] <murr4y> cool idd
[01:33:43] <murr4y> i'm from norway and i wanted to work there, but ended up somewhere else :p
[01:34:05] <coldhead> and now some punk texan has your job
[01:34:09] <coldhead> its a bloody outrage
[01:34:14] <Cork> hmm i would find opera much cooler if it was more open
[01:34:20] <coldhead> i will sign a petition to have him fired if you like
[01:34:22] <Cork> (the company and the browser)
[01:34:30] <coldhead> agreed Cork
[01:34:35] <coldhead> but the people are nice at least
[01:34:43] <coldhead> i've seen them fix bugs pretty quick
[01:34:59] <Cork> there bug tracker isn't even open >_<
[01:35:12] <Cork> its even simpler to get access to the ie bugtracker then operas :&
[01:35:13] <coldhead> that's why you take it to miketaylr!
[01:35:40] <murr4y> xD
[01:36:14] <raj> if I do `var row = $('#div>tbody:last').append('<tr></tr>')` ... row will reference <tbody> and not <tr>??
[01:36:49] <coldhead> correct raj but you could easily have tested that yourself :P
[01:37:04] <raj> well, I know it's the case, cuz I'm experiencing that issue now
[01:37:07] <Cork> raj: unless #div is <table id="div"> that won't work
[01:37:21] <coldhead> .append().find()
[01:37:23] <peiper> serdem, live() also works now but i have no idea why, didnt changed the code 0.o
[01:37:44] <raj> Cork, yes, you're right :) that was just a mistake in my haste of making an example
[01:38:05] <raj> ok, so how can I make `row` reference the actual row I've appended?
[01:38:07] <Cork> raj: tbody:last referes to the last tbody
[01:38:13] <raj> right
[01:38:17] <raj> which I want
[01:38:19] <Cork> you can't
[01:38:23] <raj> oh
[01:38:25] <serdem> peiper, fuck it. why do you care. use. enjoy ;)
[01:38:30] <Cork> you need to parse and store it into a variable before you append it
[01:38:33] <raj> so is there any way to add an element AND reference it?
[01:38:44] <raj> oh, I see
[01:38:54] <Cork> var row = $('<tr></tr>'); $('#div>tbody:last').append(row)
[01:39:04] <coldhead> $('<tr></tr>').appendTo('ur_weirdo_selector')
[01:39:11] <Cork> true
[01:39:39] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/PU2kKjcWpHLnV6mXScKxDv
[01:39:47] <raj> can I put all of lines 3-10 in a selector?
[01:39:50] <raj> or is there a better way
[01:40:14] <nVee> How do I get all the input elements of a selected input in the same div? $('.selectAll').parent('div').find('input:checked').attr('checked','checked'); fails
[01:40:33] <nVee> that 1st :checked is wrong
[01:41:12] <Cork> raj: http://paste.ofcode.org/mHqZKEZ2b8aebp5hTnEhLT
[01:41:21] <Eviltwin> nVee: Probably want .closest
[01:41:49] <raj> aah, very nice
[01:42:03] <raj> thank you
[01:42:17] <Cork> nVee: $.map($('.selectAll').parent('div').find('input:checked'), function(elm) { elm.attr('checked','checked'); });
[01:42:38] <Eviltwin> raj: Most insertions have a syntax for both orderings
[01:42:49] <Eviltwin> append/appendTo replaceAll/replaceWith etc
[01:43:07] <Eviltwin> Cork: What difference does that make?
[01:43:10] <Eviltwin> Wit hthe map
[01:43:30] <Cork> shit i forgot return
[01:43:30] <AdvoWork> coldhead, ok thanks
[01:43:41] <Cork>  $.map($('.selectAll').parent('div').find('input:checked'), function(elm) { return elm.attr('checked','checked'); });
[01:43:58] <Cork> Eviltwin: it generates an array with the values of the checkboxes
[01:44:25] <nVee> Cork you're the Einstein of jQuery :P
[01:44:26] <nVee> haha
[01:44:27] <nVee> thanks man
[01:44:35] <nVee> and thanks for the tip Eviltwin :)
[01:45:29] <Eviltwin> .get()
[01:46:07] <Eviltwin> $.map is going to make those all naked DOM elements, no?
[01:46:12] <Eviltwin> So .attr won't work
[01:46:14] <Cork> no
[01:46:18] <Cork> its no dom elements at all
[01:46:21] <Cork> *theres
[01:46:34] <Eviltwin> $('.selectAll').parent('div').find('input:checked') doesn't return DOM elements?
[01:46:52] <Cork> it generates and array like ['1','something','other']
[01:47:05] <Cork> uh... wait
[01:47:07] <Cork> >_<
[01:47:13] <Cork> i read that completly wrong...
[01:47:17] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[01:47:32] <Cork> so a simple each would suffice
[01:48:00] <Eviltwin> What do you need the each for?
[01:48:20] <Cork> attr only sets the first element
[01:48:28] <Cork> ?.attr
[01:48:28] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[01:49:08] <Cork> ah, no thats only the getter
[01:49:19] <Eviltwin> ?.attr(...,...)
[01:49:19] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName, value): Set one or more attributes for the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr2
[01:49:44] <Cork> ook, messed that up completly >_<
[01:52:07] <Eviltwin> I think maybe he's looking for this: http://jsfiddle.net/2vJ4e/

[01:55:09] <Flo0815> hey guys, i have an application with multiple ajaxrequests and a loading-grafic, which should be displayed everytime an ajax requests is performed. When the request is finished it should disappear. So when the request starts, the div with the gif is shown. in ajax.success: i put the hide-command. Now the problem is that the loading grafic won't disappear when multiple ajax requests are running
[01:55:09] <Flo0815> simultaniously. Any suggestions?
[01:56:45] <peiper> Flo0815, i guess its because ajax requests are asynchronous
[01:57:01] <Eviltwin> peiper: Genius
[01:57:02] <peiper> Flo0815, add async: false into the request options
[01:57:06] <Eviltwin> NO
[01:57:08] <Eviltwin> ABSOLUTELY NOT
[01:57:15] <Flo0815> no
[01:57:34] <peiper> i had a similiar problem and fixed it with async: false
[01:57:43] <Eviltwin> Then you didn't really fix it
[01:57:46] <Eviltwin> async: false shouldn't be used
[01:58:12] <Flo0815> the success: part only kicks in if the requests is finished, not important if async or sync
[01:58:18] <Eviltwin> "The first letter in Ajax stands for "asynchronous," meaning that the operation occurs in parallel and the order of completion is not guaranteed. The async option to $.ajax() defaults to true, indicating that code execution can continue after the request is made. Setting this option to false (and thus making the call no longer asynchronous) is strongly discouraged, as it can cause the browser to become unresponsive."
[01:58:44] <Jakey_Cloud> hi
[01:58:46] <Jakey_Cloud> i need help
[01:58:52] <Flo0815> i don't get it, when the page is loaded, there are 2 requests, they are done, the grfic disappears
[01:58:54] <Jakey_Cloud> with ajax progress bar
[01:59:00] <Jakey_Cloud> using jquery
[01:59:08] <Flo0815> but if i trigger a request manually (e.g. tying in a searchbox)
[01:59:12] <Flo0815> the grafic stays
[01:59:19] <Jakey_Cloud> i cant do the ajax loading fine
[01:59:31] <Jakey_Cloud> but need to know some tuts on implementing the progress bar
[02:00:18] <peiper> have u checked ur requests with firebug?
[02:00:19] <F3rr31r4> how does it call the function when we pass the mouse hover an object and appears  somethingÂ»???????
[02:00:23] <Flo0815> peiper sure
[02:00:38] <Flo0815> they deliever the data which is requiered
[02:00:38] <peiper> F3rr31r4, mouseover? ^^
[02:00:45] <Jakey_Cloud> anyone
[02:00:55] <Flo0815> Jakey_Cloud: details?
[02:01:24] <F3rr31r4> peiper yes. pass the mouse on a object but no click in the object
[02:01:34] <F3rr31r4> peiper just in the top of the object
[02:01:37] <peiper> as i said its called "mouseover"
[02:01:48] <Flo0815> peiper: i put a console.log('test'); before the hide-command, and this is executed
[02:02:17] <peiper> hm
[02:02:46] <Flo0815> and typing the hide command in the firebug console hides the bar correctly
[02:02:51] <peiper> F3rr31r4, http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[02:03:09] <Jakey_Cloud> Flo0815: just an implementation for progressbar when uploading
[02:03:12] <murr4y> coldhead: just in case you'd like to follow that issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10137897/
[02:03:44] <F3rr31r4> peiper yes, but in this code it have other, don't have that one :(
[02:03:58] <Flo0815> Jakey_Cloud ?
[02:04:25] <Flo0815> oh ok...i think i got it
[02:04:31] <Flo0815> ajax requests are fine
[02:04:37] <peiper> what was the matter
[02:04:46] <Jakey_Cloud> Flo0815: i want to know how to implement a progressbar using ajax upload
[02:04:52] <Flo0815> i unload the grqafic by setting a timer
[02:05:04] <Jakey_Cloud> i can do ajax upload fine now but no indication of progressbar
[02:05:11] <Flo0815> and this timer is only set if no timer is set before
[02:05:25] <Flo0815> i think the timer-management is fucked up
[02:05:51] <Flo0815> Jakey_Cloud: i don't know, google?
[02:06:25] <Jakey_Cloud> i try Flo0815 no luck
[02:12:29] <Jakey_Cloud> fuck it
[02:17:19] <ZeuZ> Question: I've got a styled input (<input class="class" name="object1" type="text">) but doing $("#object1").val() does not return the text in it, what am I doing wrong?
[02:17:58] <tra> ZeuZ: you should have an id="object1" for your selector to work
[02:18:53] <peiper> ZeuZ, # is for ID's you would need an id="object1" in your input field
[02:19:05] <quicksilver> or you could use the selector $("[name=object1]")
[02:19:16] <quicksilver> which might be better than adding an unneeded ID>
[02:20:40] <ZeuZ> quicksilver, thanks that worked out the way I wanted it ;)
[02:20:56] <ZeuZ> tra, peiper, also thanks, I forgot to check that out
[02:21:04] <SGhosh> Hey! when a cookie is set is it set as a string?i want to retrieve my cookie value which i had set as an integer , increment it and set it back again.how do go about it?
[02:21:24] <Cork> ?parseInt
[02:21:43] <SGhosh> tried that, returns NaN
[02:22:06] <Cork> ?eval parseInt('502', 10) + 1
[02:22:07] <caniuse> Cork: 503
[02:22:19] <Cork> ?eval parseInt('a502', 10) + 1
[02:22:20] <caniuse> Cork: null
[02:24:40] <peiper> question: imagine you have 1 UL on your page with ~5 li's you got $("ul") as selector now i want to .each trough the li's (i did this with $(this).children().each()...) how can i access the attributes of the LI's now?? i need atleast class,id,value
[02:25:26] <quicksilver> peiper: use "this" inside the .each().
[02:25:38] <quicksilver> peiper: (LIs don't have a "value" ;)
[02:26:15] <peiper> quicksilver, thanks thats what i needed :D with value i meant what between <li> and </li> is
[02:26:30] <irqq> has anyone here had an experience with openrico's livegrid http://dowdybrown.com/dbprod/rico3/demo/ ? What solution based on jquery would be a closest repacement for it? I do not want to invest my time in openrico, because it does not seem be maintained.
[02:35:29] <F3rr31r4> does any one know how to define a new data +2 years?  http://pastebin.com/5c7WDHBF
[02:35:45] <F3rr31r4> don't have any clue :(
[02:43:21] <F3rr31r4> ???????????? minStart.setTime(minStart.getTime() - 1 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
[02:43:52] <heartofashark> Inside a javascript function, I have var foo = $('#some-form-input-selector').val();  The problem is that this only ever pulls the original value that was set there when the page loaded. It won't pull any newly set values out.
[02:45:12] <unknown6> how do i make element fadeout and fadein without flickering. i tried promise() like this: $(".yea").fadeOut('fast').promise().done(function() { $(this).fadeIn('slow'); }); but it still flickers, like it disappers, elements below collapses and it fades in
[02:45:24] <SGhosh> Cork: thanks!it wasnt working but finally worked :)
[02:46:18] <quicksilver> heartofashark: that's not how it works, you must have something else wrong.
[02:46:29] <heartofashark> ok, double-checking right now
[02:46:30] <quicksilver> heartofashark: if I have to guess, I'll guess you have two elements matching the same selector.
[02:46:31] <heartofashark> thanks for reply
[02:46:44] <quicksilver> and you're selecting the first one (which indeed still has the original value)
[02:46:46] <heartofashark> god i love IRC
[02:47:09] <quicksilver> $('your-special-selector').length will tell you how many matches
[02:47:18] <quicksilver> (but .val() always pulls the value from the first, if many match)
[02:47:26] <Slydder> hay all. I have a list of DIV IDs which represent the order that the given divs should be in when done loading that page. How can I go about reordering the divs though?
[02:49:47] <dokma|2> I have jquery included but a simple submit handler on a form just doesn't work. What is the easiest way to verify that jquery actually is properly loaded and works?
[02:50:19] <david> good day
[03:04:38] <krizoek> hello, im new to javascripting; and i just copied http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple into http://scripture.sourceforge.net/tmp/ajs2.html having it load the google jquery api first; shouldn't it work like this ??
[03:05:39] <varnie> Hello
[03:05:55] <varnie> I have an item, how do I get the first its child with some class specified?
[03:06:19] <varnie> smth like $this.children('.abc')
[03:09:05] <PavelloZ> .find('.class:first-child')
[03:09:06] <PavelloZ> for example
[03:09:22] <PavelloZ> or better
[03:09:27] <PavelloZ> .find('.class').first()
[03:10:36] <PavelloZ> ok that doesnt work
[03:10:42] <PavelloZ> for whatever reason
[03:10:46] <varnie> no it works for me
[03:10:54] <PavelloZ> ouh thats interesting :)
[03:11:05] <varnie> and even $(item).find('.class:first') works
[03:11:18] <varnie> are they equal?
[03:11:28] <PavelloZ> i guess
[03:11:46] <PavelloZ> another approach, select first item in array of .class elements find('.class')[0]
[03:12:08] <PavelloZ> and it returns undefined if none .class exists
[03:14:23] <varnie> thank you
[03:15:31] <nFFF> You may prefer to check the length property if you simply want to see if the object contains any elements
[03:27:01] <gnagno> hello all
[03:32:14] <MACscr> ok, so im using $.ajax() to submit a form, but i do need to actually use part of the form data in my response. If im doing something like data: $('#assign_form_to_user').serialize(), how can i get a particular field from that?
[03:34:10] <MACscr> er, nvm
[03:35:49] <gnagno> can someone please help me with this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/gnagno/HTcZT/10/ I'd like to make the zoom increase the size of the image using the center of the image itself as pivot.... is it possible ?
[03:45:06] <amit_usual> does anyone know of jquery time validation plugin
[03:45:32] <nFFF> gnagno, ugly solution: http://jsfiddle.net/HTcZT/14/
[03:46:09] <StevenCodes> gnagno,  nice example though
[03:47:45] <nFFF> gnagno, heres a full example : http://jsfiddle.net/HTcZT/16/
[03:47:50] <nFFF> so that it does it on zoomout also
[03:48:41] <StevenCodes> might want to change css z-index if image gets to big it covers options
[03:50:44] <Guest2971> I am part of a Typo3 development team and we are have trouble with 3 jquery written extensions using different 3 versions - Beauty-0.9.5-rc1, 1.6 and 1.7.1
[03:51:35] <gnagno> StevenCodes, I will limit the zoom so that it will never cover the options
[03:51:48] <Guest2971> not being a jquery developer is it possible to alter a jquery extension so they all use the same version ?
[03:51:53] <StevenCodes> gnagno,  if you do plz send update been lookin for this
[03:51:54] <gnagno> nFFF, this is what I achieved, but the animation is not smooth at all
[03:53:37] <gnagno> http://jsfiddle.net/gnagno/HTcZT/15/
[03:54:06] <gnagno> nFFF, sorry I forgot to add the link :) http://jsfiddle.net/gnagno/HTcZT/15/
[03:54:09] <MACscr> any idea what i might be doing wrong here that is stopping the radio fields from pre populating? This had been working a couple months ago, though i was using much simpler forms then: http://jsfiddle.net/NLUMm/
[03:54:46] <StevenCodes> gnagno,  it moves up and left everytime
[03:55:01] <gnagno> StevenCodes, what do you mean?
[03:55:16] <gnagno> sorry, the correct one is this: http://jsfiddle.net/gnagno/HTcZT/19/
[03:55:18] <StevenCodes> the animation just moves off screen if i click like 3 or 4 times
[03:55:30] <StevenCodes> you should limit it to 3 zooms or so
[03:55:37] <StevenCodes> or limit the container
[03:55:43] <StevenCodes> so it just shows the zoomed part
[03:55:52] <StevenCodes> would be better

[04:24:34] <bradbrad> Guys please please please help me to sort out whatever is causing the conflict here http://nex.lakelandfoodco.com . . .just dont know what to do!
[04:24:38] <Hopsy> so this is
[04:25:04] <MACscr> i personally dont use an facebook apps because of the bs of them wanting access to my friends lists
[04:25:17] <timing> bradbrad: what is the issue my dear?
[04:25:35] <StevenCodes> stupid ass question but whats the word for the oppsite of enlargen
[04:25:38] <bradbrad> timing the facebook slider is stopping the main slider from loading!
[04:25:57] <bradbrad> that damn endless loading loop
[04:26:10] <Hopsy> MACscr: indeed, WHY cant you just select which access you want to give
[04:26:14] <Hopsy> so in my case none
[04:26:25] <bradbrad> got it!
[04:26:26] <bradbrad> yay
[04:26:28] <Hopsy> which permisions *
[04:26:40] <MACscr> because thats how they get all the companies making the apps? is so they can access your data
[04:26:47] <MACscr> er, its
[04:27:21] <MACscr> FB doesnt care who has access to your data and your friends data as long as you click a little "accept" button
[04:32:06] <peiper> Guys what do you prefer .ajax() or .load() or .get() or .post() ?
[04:32:31] <ItsMeLenny> hate ajax
[04:34:59] <ravenzz> peiper ajax, it gives you more control
[04:36:33] <peiper> ry
[04:36:35] <peiper> ty
[04:38:49] <MACscr> if i want to find form elements with a particular name and value and check them if they match, would it be something like so? $('[name=' + name + '] input[value=' + val + ']').attr('checked', true);
[04:42:17] <MACscr> sweet, i think $('[name=' + name + '][value=' + val + ']').attr('checked', true); works
[04:44:01] <amit_usual> is there a time picker that can check for range based on user input

[05:38:26] <anli_> Is there anyone having an idea how this can happen? http://anders.dev.100procent.com/
[05:40:14] <StevenCodes> anli_,  That is a wierd one
[05:40:20] <anli_> yeah
[05:40:27] <anli_> Is it encoding?
[05:40:30] <StevenCodes> no
[05:40:33] <pachet> arpz: https://gist.github.com/2376650
[05:40:38] <StevenCodes> its got compailibility mode on
[05:40:54] <anli_> Compatibility mode?
[05:40:56] <arpz> pachet: Thanks very much, will give it a go
[05:40:59] <StevenCodes> anli_,  compadability mode is on on the right
[05:41:01] <ravenzz> uhm
[05:41:07] <StevenCodes> the blue little note next to URL
[05:41:08] <ravenzz> any idea why this doesn't work? attenders.find('tr:first').addClass('newRegistered').delay(10000).removeClass('newRegistered')
[05:41:14] <anli_> but its the same webpage, using the same web browser
[05:41:16] <StevenCodes> looks broke
[05:41:28] <ravenzz> if i cut the delay/remove part it woks
[05:41:40] <StevenCodes> anli_,  but you have compadability mode on the right
[05:41:42] <multi_io> is there a BNF or something for selector expressions?
[05:41:47] <StevenCodes> it wont work with that
[05:42:06] <anli_> StevenCodes: Is it a browser settings for local domains?
[05:42:13] <anli_> -s
[05:42:15] <dipser> anli_: but different engine it seems
[05:42:20] <anli_> the same browser
[05:42:33] <arpz> pachet: the box now never moves.. it appears and disappears as expected but does not at all follow the mouse, just appears in the middle of the table
[05:42:41] <anli_> must try ip instead of localhost
[05:42:44] <StevenCodes> anli_, no you must have clicked it its next to URL looks blue and is highlighted as the little broken notepad click it
[05:43:02] <StevenCodes> on 2nd browsrer at top
[05:43:27] <anli_> ok, ip instead of localhost is making the webpage render correctly
[05:43:31] <anli_> 127.0.0.1
[05:43:44] <multi_io> I want to select all input elements below form elements with action="myform". How do I do that? $('form[action="myform"] > input')  isn't it.
[05:44:01] <multi_io> is this possible at all?
[05:44:17] <quicksilver> what you wrote is correct, multi_io
[05:44:27] <quicksilver> although it will only catch inputs which are immediate descendants
[05:44:35] <anli_> Why just not $('input')
[05:45:51] <multi_io> anli_: because there's inputs outside that form which I don't want to select.
[05:45:54] <pachet> StevenCodes : no, its not because he clicked it
[05:46:04] <multi_io> anli_: I just found find(). That works.
[05:46:09] <pachet> IE will default to compat mode if it considers the page to be hosted on intranet
[05:46:13] <Teduardo> Howdy sirs, I have a table in a MySQL database that correlates two values on a form one is the 'operating system' and one is a list of software options that are compatible with that operating system.. I'd like to use jquery to prevent users from selecting software that is not compatible but I don't want to explicitly remove the incompatible options from the <selects> is there a way in javascript
[05:46:13] <Teduardo> to make a selection unselectable?
[05:46:16] <pachet> which is true (usually) for localhost
[05:46:26] <multi_io> $('form[action="myform"]').find("input")
[05:46:31] <StevenCodes> pachet, oh really didn't know that sorry
[05:46:45] <pachet> anli_: ^
[05:47:00] <quicksilver> multi_io: that's the same as 'form[action="myform"] input'
[05:47:04] <anli_> back
[05:47:17] <quicksilver> multi_io: the difference is the '>' which was restricting it to immediate children.
[05:47:23] <multi_io> quicksilver: ah
[05:47:30] <anli_> What is making the divs below each other more compatible?
[05:47:35] <multi_io> quicksilver: thanks
[05:47:37] <anli_> Compatible to what?
[05:48:28] <pachet> its just a rendering setting that IE applies for different zones, different doctypes, etc
[05:48:39] <pachet> in this case its because you're viewing it on localhost, that's all
[05:48:48] <anli_> Can I use doctype to be more expressive about wanting html5 compatibility?
[05:49:14] <pachet> sure
[05:49:21] <pachet> but it likely won't affect IE's intranet settings
[05:49:32] <pachet> unless you go into IE options and change the settings for it explicitly
[05:49:52] <anli_> How can I want a webpage to render differently on the intranet
[05:49:59] <pachet> arpz: its working for me: http://jsfiddle.net/jCCHe/
[05:50:19] <pachet> (i *did* forget my var dec on 'y', added that in the above)
[05:51:54] <arpz> pachet: odd. I don't know then, I'm starting to wonder whether the current 'broken' behaviour is better anyway
[05:54:28] <pachet> anli_: you have to set a compat header in your req response
[05:54:31] <pachet> its a server setting
[05:54:36] <pachet> here's a SO on how to do it in IIS
[05:54:38] <pachet> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518256/override-intranet-compatibility-mode-ie8

[05:56:14] <pachet> it might be, i don't know -- if it is i'll just grumble quietly to myself
[05:57:02] <Teduardo> is there an easy way in jquery to have a form post to itself when a named element changes?
[05:57:09] <ravenzz> attenders.find('tr:first').addClass('newRegistered').delay(10000).removeClass('newRegistered'); why this is not working?
[05:57:10] <arpz> this is so weird, that it's not working here, I just tried changing the CSS to match mine in the jsfiddle thing but it *still* works there :/
[05:57:18] <ravenzz> attenders.find('tr:first').addClass('newRegistered'); this work
[05:57:19] <ravenzz> s
[05:57:44] <pachet> ravenzz: delay affects the current fx queue
[05:58:02] <ravenzz> so it doesen't work on addclass
[05:58:06] <ravenzz> right?
[05:58:24] <pachet> not out of the box
[05:58:26] <quicksilver> correct.
[05:58:35] <quicksilver> you can stick the removeClass in the callback to the delay.
[05:58:55] <quicksilver> probably the simplest solution for that example
[05:59:34] <pachet> $(foo).addClass('bar').delay(3000).queue(function(callback){$(this).addClass('wat'); callback();});

[06:00:29] <monk13> I have a regular app and ajax app... i have 2 different app js files. although 75% is very similar like: "$('.input-zip').bind('keyup blur', function(e) {" in regular app, and "$('#content_inner_wrapper').on('keyup blur',..." in ajax app. Do you guys see a nice way to cut back all this into 1 codebase for both apps?, or do usual ajax apps split with the regular webapp in main js file?
[06:00:44] <Nece228> in function brackets can i name that function?
[06:01:04] <Nece228> so i will be able to use it elsewhere not necessary on #button click
[06:04:08] <pachet> Nece228: yes and no
[06:04:10] <pachet> you can name the fn, sure
[06:04:35] <quicksilver> pachet: surely $(foo).addClass('bar').delay(3000,function(){$(this).addClass('wat');}) is simpler?
[06:04:36] <Nece228> pachet: oh, thanks for informing
[06:04:43] <pachet> but it won't be accessible
[06:04:48] <Nece228> just wanted to be sure
[06:04:49] <pachet> it's still useful for debugging though
[06:12:05] <ec8or_> how could refreshing the page hitting enter or using F5 have any impact on a script? this is in Chrome
[06:12:20] <ec8or_> same think in Firefox though.. but there it is refresh or hard refresh that renders is differently
[06:12:49] <ec8or_> IE for some reason works no matter what :/
[06:17:08] <Trisox> any one used http://kmalakoff.github.com/knockback/ before?
[06:19:49] <pachet> quicksilver: late response, but no
[06:20:06] <pachet> $(foo).delay() takes the queue name as its second arg
[06:20:14] <pachet> you're probably thinking of padolsey's plugin
[06:20:55] <pachet> ?delay @ quicksilver
[06:20:55] <caniuse> quicksilver: .delay(): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[06:21:42] <quicksilver> pachet: oh, interesting.
[06:21:55] <quicksilver> pachet: I always thought of it as a "pseudo-animation" which just didn't actually animate anything.
[06:22:05] <quicksilver> pachet: so I assumed it had a callback like the abimations do
[06:22:09] <quicksilver> obviously I never checked.
[06:22:23] <quicksilver> live and learn.
[06:24:02] <ric> ciao
[06:24:54] <pachet> hi
[06:25:11] <Advant> I have a redraw issue in Chrome, I have anchor links on my navigation bar, but when I click them the bar isn't drawing at the top.  However, if I drag the mouse over it then redraws.  What might cause this behavior?
[06:30:17] <ric> ccccciiiiiiiaaaaaaoooooooooo
[06:37:45] <monk13> Is there a way to see in a bind which event its being called for? something like $('#blah').bind('input paste blur',function(evt) {  evt.name???;  });
[06:39:32] <pachet> monk13: event.type
[06:39:43] <monk13> pachet, excellent thanks :).
[06:39:54] <pachet> yw
[06:42:15] <Trisox> whats the diference between  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" > and  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=7"> for example?
[06:43:45] <toddWork> what should i be using to combine js and css files? i'm thinking of a script that will combine your files if needed and compress them. thanks.
[06:45:12] <pachet> Trisox: EmulateIE7 renders in compat mode but still respects <!DOCTYPE>
[06:45:22] <Trisox> ah oke
[06:45:57] <Trisox> i try to find out when it goes in compact view en when not
[06:45:59] <toddWork> omg. whats sass?
[06:46:21] <Trisox> i prefer less :D
[06:46:32] <Trisox> sass and compass is cool 2
[06:46:44] <pachet> toddWork: i just use closure compiler :[
[06:46:51] <Trisox> googles one?
[06:48:00] <toddWork> is there a jquery or javascript solution? i've finished a site (the basics) and before it gets unwieldy i'd like to start breaking out my js and css files into nice, neat files and then roll them all up .
[06:48:17] <toddWork> at "runtime".
[06:48:51] <toddWork> so, for instance, the closure compiler, does that run at page load?
[06:49:57] <pachet> no
[06:50:34] <toddWork> ok.probably not what i'm looking for.
[06:50:55] <Trisox> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms533876%28v=vs.85%29.aspx <--
[06:51:04] <pachet> why exactly do you want to minify everything at runtime
[06:51:16] <pachet> won't that tax your server unnecessarily :[
[06:51:25] <pachet> i'm assuming that by runtime you mean, when the resources are requested
[06:51:26] <Trisox> toddWork: look @ html5 boilerplate they got scripts like that
[06:51:28] <toddWork> not necessarily minify; more like include.
[06:51:35] <pachet> oh
[06:51:37] <toddWork> Trisox: ok.
[06:51:39] <Trisox> :)
[06:51:43] <toddWork> thanks
[06:51:46] <Trisox> build ant something
[06:51:50] <Trisox> i think its called
[06:52:09] <toddWork> i'm glad i asked but i'm using some boilerplate stuff already.
[06:52:16] <toddWork> *because, not but
[06:52:58] <sublimenal> Hey there, I know this is a general javascript question sorry. But in php you use += within a loop to add the totals of the looped content. Is there a way to do that with javsacript?
[06:53:07] <sublimenal> I'm using  the .each jquery function
[06:53:16] <pachet> toddWork: i don't usually need to work with async file includes, but i use require.js when i do
[06:53:32] <toddWork> yeah, the ant build script looks like what i'm looking for.
[06:53:34] <pachet> it can handle async js/css with dependency trees pretty well
[06:53:36] <Jon47> sublimenal: javascript has ++ and â but i don't think you can do +=
[06:53:43] <toddWork> pachet: does require.js also handle css files?
[06:53:45] <pachet> ?g require.js @ toddWork
[06:53:45] <caniuse> toddWork: RequireJS - http://requirejs.org/
[06:53:46] <solsTiCe> hi. I have this code http://paste.pocoo.org/show/580776  that fails in IE8 with an error "  Unexpected call to method or property access.  jquery-1.7.2.min.js, line 3 character 32549". Is this a bug ?
[06:53:49] <pachet> toddWork: yep
[06:53:53] <toddWork> hmm.
[06:53:55] <toddWork> ok.
[06:54:00] <solsTiCe> it happens at line 2
[06:54:08] <toddWork> i'll check out those ant and require.
[06:54:21] <Jon47> require.js can load css files but i think it's not currently able to accurately report when they actually LOAD
[06:54:46] <Trisox> toddWork: :D
[06:54:51] <toddWork> Jon47: so you need to test for devs or something?
[06:54:55] <toddWork> *divs
[06:55:07] <Jon47> I guess that would be a possible workaround
[06:55:17] <toddWork> ok.
[06:55:18] <Jon47> I know that chrome canary recently added css load events so it may start to get better soon
[06:55:23] <sublimenal> so would that work like this? http://pastebin.com/vakQkhZ1
[06:55:32] <Jon47> it's not an issue with require, it's an issue with browsers
[06:55:34] <Trisox> http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html ?
[06:55:59] <sublimenal> err i mean like this http://pastebin.com/wcYnw48R
[06:56:11] <Trisox> http://labjs.com/
[06:56:18] <toddWork> Jon47: that would be great. i'm on the cusp of just moving to framework because of this very issue but the site just isn't that big.
[06:56:40] <Jon47> sublimenal: no, ++ and â just add or subtract one, it's not an operator that takes a second argument
[06:57:15] <Jon47>  Â var total = total + $(this).attr("alt");
[06:57:19] <Jon47> just do it thatway
[06:57:26] <pachet> Jon47: that's true, its a definite limitation
[06:57:37] <pachet> i patched require to load css over ajax and create <style> tags
[06:57:39] <sublimenal> Oh ok i see, so the total still exists thanks
[06:57:44] <pachet> but obviously that only works same-domain
[06:57:57] <pachet> but, does let you know exactly when its been loaded!
[06:58:16] <Jon47> pachet oh wait, forgota bout scope - just declare "total" before the loop
[06:58:25] <Jon47> not inside the loop..
[06:58:42] <Jon47> er..sublimenal --^
[06:58:45] <pachet> heh
[06:59:14] <faraway> pachet: does this alway work for you in all browsers. i sometimes had problems with that in some browser (completely messing up the styles) but i currently don't know in which browsers this happened
[06:59:28] <pachet> faraway: yeah, it does
[06:59:32] <pachet> everything i've tested in, anyway
[06:59:43] <pachet> you kind of have to do some fiddling to make it work in IE
[06:59:55] <pachet> it uses its own .cssText prop
[06:59:56] <sublimenal> Ok thanks guys got it
[06:59:56] <pachet> :[
[07:00:46] <faraway> pachet: just wondering .. for css files of the same domain, i test the styles property for url and content with a timeout to check if they are loaded.
[07:01:01] <Joeytje50> hi, is there a way to define the timeout in $.getJSON()?
[07:01:07] <Joeytje50> or would I need to use ajax?
[07:01:27] <Joeytje50> well, getJSON is also ajax, but would I need to use $.ajax()
[07:02:04] <pachet> Joeytje50: short answer, yes
[07:02:11] <Joeytje50> okay
[07:02:48] <Trisox> :)
[07:03:26] <faraway> pachet: how do did you solve the problem with background-images urls in the css file ?  (just using absolute ones?)
[07:03:51] <pachet> faraway: i didnt ever address that
[07:04:00] <pachet> that's a lot more headache :[
[07:04:09] <pachet> depending on the browser you're not even sure if those assets are immediately loaderd
[07:04:12] <pachet> *loaded
[07:04:18] <faraway> pachet: hmm .. ok then i'll stay with may approach :D
[07:04:24] <pachet> eg, if the element is specified as 'display: none'
[07:04:59] <toddWork> i need to clean a string (twitter 'text' and 'username') that would break JSON. so, special characters etc. is there a /regex or plugin for this?
[07:05:04] <pachet> if you're dead-set on loading image assets you could parse the <style> contents for url('...') and load those into new Images()
[07:05:15] <pachet> then when all the images have loaded, you know the assets are in cache
[07:09:31] <faraway> pachet: no .. just wondered , that if you request the css via $.get and place the content in a style tag and a rule has a background-image with a relative url, the relative url would not work cause it would use the url relative to the document and not the css file anymore. and if you solved this
[07:12:33] <pachet> faraway: oh, im sorry i misunderstood
[07:12:37] <pachet> yeah, i never use relative urls
[07:13:09] <pachet> or if i do, i only use them in .css files that i know will be loaded into my controller
[07:13:14] <pachet> so i know the root path
[07:13:39] <faraway> pachet: ok .. i had that problem with some 3rd party css files i loaded on demand. so i switched to checking for the content of document.styleSheets
[07:16:26] <Acrack> hello
[07:16:37] <pachet> hi
[07:16:50] <Acrack> i have an issue making a slider work with span
[07:17:05] <Acrack> it is working with inputs but not spans (the jquery ui slider)
[07:17:13] <Acrack> http://pastie.org/3780703
[07:17:26] <Earthnail> hey everybody
[07:17:27] <Acrack> if someone can tell me what i should put instead of the "???"
[07:17:30] <Earthnail> I have trouble with .data()
[07:18:06] <Earthnail> if I save some data with $('somerandomelement').data(key, value) in the $(function() {...}) method, it all works fine
[07:18:28] <Earthnail> however, if I do so during the start or drop events of draggable and droppable and try to save data on them, it doesn't work
[07:18:52] <faraway> is there a limit of for parallel opened ajax request in the browsers ?
[07:18:54] <Earthnail> which is strange, because setting data() on $('body') works everywhere and all of the time
[07:19:38] <pachet> faraway: it depends on the browser
[07:20:05] <faraway> pachet: do you know a site where this limits a listed ?
[07:23:00] <velocitykendal> Hi guys, any idea how I could do something where a form text field is updated in realtime by the input in another form field?
[07:23:16] <b-lew> I have this sort feature that keeps duplicating images in fancybox and prettyphoto is there anyway I can get some help on how to fix this problem?
[07:23:30] <b-lew> it looks like this loop is screwing everything upâ¦
[07:23:30] <b-lew> $('.image-grid_' + (i+1) ).fGallery('.filter_' + (i+1) );
[07:23:35] <velocitykendal> i.e. dynamic cloning of input value
[07:23:44] <alexr2_> velocitykendal, bind an event to the first input and change the second input based on that
[07:24:37] <velocitykendal> alexr2_: Sounds fine in theory but are you able to provide a bit more info...?
[07:24:39] <b-lew> and duplicating my rel attribute
[07:24:57] <velocitykendal> what event can I binde for example?
[07:24:59] <b-lew> fgallery.js might be the problem but i have no idea how to fix it
[07:25:36] <alexr2_> well what's your first input
[07:26:04] <velocitykendal> $('input.textfield').bind('', function (){...}); ???
[07:26:27] <alexr2_> essentially yes
[07:26:27] <b-lew> anyone?
[07:27:02] <pachet> faraway: sorry, stepped out for a minute
[07:27:07] <pachet> check out http://www.browserscope.org/?category=network
[07:28:06] <velocitykendal> alexr2_: So now I've got to work out what to bind to and what to do in the function....
[07:28:17] <alexr2_> you got it...
[07:28:20] <faraway> pachet: thx. that helps much
[07:28:23] <b-lew> alexr2_ can I get some help when you have a sec?
[07:28:26] <velocitykendal> any pointers? :P
[07:28:36] <b-lew> i know you're busy right now
[07:28:39] <alexr2_> give me 1 sec velocitykendal
[07:28:45] <sunbeam> I'm checking a site now, and the file that is used to check inputs in a form (live/ajax) is called this: http://getcreditable.com/remoteCheck/checknameavail?displayName=user
[07:28:46] <velocitykendal> thnx
[07:28:54] <sunbeam> checknameavail - how come they don't use extension?
[07:29:00] <sunbeam> I see that more often
[07:30:10] <alexr2_> velocitykendal http://jsfiddle.net/rwZLp/
[07:31:05] <alexr2_> b-lew, you're asking a pretty specific question about a specific plugin, you might be better off on stackoverflow with a tag for that plugin
[07:31:20] <velocitykendal> alexr2_: Excellent! thank you
[07:32:06] <b-lew> okay.
[07:32:22] <b-lew> I think this script might be screwing up the rel attribute and loop
[07:32:23] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/3780786
[07:32:31] <b-lew> but i have no idea how to fix it
[07:32:45] <b-lew> never heard of stackoverflow but i'll google it
[07:33:01] <alexr2_> b-lew, that script doesn't even use the rel attribute?
[07:33:12] <alexr2_> it has no reference to it
[07:33:17] <velocitykendal> alexr2_: Any ideas how I could concatinate 2 fields into field#3 ?
[07:33:40] <b-lew> but when i call it in another fileâ¦ this line in particular
[07:33:40] <b-lew> $('.image-grid_' + (i+1) ).fGallery('.filter_' + (i+1) );
[07:33:52] <b-lew> it duplicates all my images in any pop up gallery
[07:34:02] <b-lew> that uses rel
[07:34:18] <b-lew> I've tried fancybox and pretty photo
[07:34:52] <alexr2_> velocitykendal, use 2 bind events, and the selectors inside the bind should get the values of both inputs and concatenate them
[07:35:04] <alexr2_> b-lew what is your overall goal of your project?
[07:36:03] <b-lew> to have a popup gallery that includes video and images to show work for a clientâ¦ but the thumbnails to those galleries need to be sorted
[07:38:31] <alexr2_> have you tried fancybox 2?
[07:38:35] <b-lew> yep
[07:38:39] <b-lew> and 1.3.4
[07:38:42] <b-lew> and prettyphoto
[07:38:51] <alexr2_> what is fgallery?
[07:39:08] <alexr2_> oh is this a wordpress project?
[07:39:15] <b-lew> no wordpress
[07:39:27] <alexr2_> then why are you using a wordpress plugin?
[07:39:39] <b-lew> i think fgallery is filtering my thumbnails in categories
[07:39:43] <b-lew> i'm not? I don't think
[07:40:08] <sunbeam> I'm checking a site now, and the file that is used to check inputs in a form (live/ajax) is called this: http://getcreditable.com/remoteCheck/checknameavail?displayName=user
[07:40:16] <sunbeam> checknameavail - how come they don't use extension? see this more often
[07:40:22] <b-lew> is there a way to make that line of code more specific so that it doesn't screw with the pop-up gallery though?
[07:40:40] <alexr2_> what is the link for fgallery?
[07:41:48] <ezio> is there a way to get a parent that might be x number of elements above that is of selector expression?
[07:41:59] <b-lew> well this is a html template i bought
[07:42:16] <b-lew> looks like its this though...
[07:42:17] <b-lew> http://fahlstad.se/wordpress/plugins/fgallery/
[07:42:21] <b-lew> lame
[07:42:23] <alexr2_> which is a wordpress plugin :-P
[07:42:26] <webdev> hello
[07:42:40] <ezio> <tr><td><span id='x'> $('x').click(function(){$(this).parent( .... i want the tr
[07:42:45] <ezio> anyone know how?
[07:42:46] <b-lew> well shitâ¦
[07:42:52] <b-lew> i'll contact them them
[07:42:54] <b-lew> then
[07:42:54] <webdev> is  this correct for a radio click function ..if ($(this).not(':checked')) { }
[07:43:01] <b-lew> i've been trying to fix this problem for weeks
[07:43:02] <alexr2_> that might not be what's causing it to have an issue, but if it is, i can't help you
[07:43:12] <alexr2_> i don't know wordpress or how it affects things
[07:43:23] <toddWork> ?closest @ezio
[07:43:24] <bot-t> ezio, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[07:43:31] <ezio> tyvm
[07:43:32] <ezio> !
[07:43:36] <toddWork> maybe?
[07:43:47] <alexr2_> you can do the same thing with ?parent
[07:43:51] <alexr2_> have a selector in it
[07:44:03] <b-lew> well i'm not using wordpress
[07:44:13] <toddWork> .parent().parent('tr')
[07:44:15] <b-lew> so someone must have took it and integrated it into this template
[07:46:52] * webdev jumps around
[07:47:04] <b-lew> ughâ¦ FML
[07:49:10] <alexr2_> yeah
[07:49:11] <alexr2_> sorry dude
[07:53:49] <flaccid> i need to retrieve data cross domain from another host which is essentially just a http request via ajax. i've read up on some reasearch where i will still need to depend on requirements server-side with the arbitrary xdomain site such as content type and return encapsulation
[07:54:13] <flaccid> what should i use to negate these requirements. the content type is arbitrary and i don't have control on the xdomain
[07:55:08] <alexr2_> flaccid, try jsonp
[07:55:32] <flaccid> alexr2_: doesn't the 3rd party xdomain need to return a jsonp output?
[07:55:40] <alexr2_> it does
[07:55:56] <flaccid> like i said, i don't have control on that
[07:56:05] <alexr2_> how do you know it's not built to return it?
[07:56:10] <alexr2_> a lot of apis are able to account for that
[07:56:16] <flaccid> because i work for the company that made it
[07:56:44] <flaccid> but i can't just get this change done
[07:57:07] <b-lew> thats what they all say. heh
[07:57:10] <flaccid> but regardless, is it possible with an arbitrary site or is there always going to be a server-side requirement?
[07:57:16] <b-lew> i'll try stackoverflow
[07:57:21] <flaccid> ty
[07:57:43] <alexr2_> you can try to do an ajax request to your own server, and have your own server do a file_get_contents or something
[07:57:49] <alexr2_> or a curl request
[07:58:11] <flaccid> no server-side
[07:58:16] <alexr2_> then no, it's not possible
[08:00:38] <flaccid> {"readyState":4,"status":200,"statusText":"success"} seems to return a 200 though
[08:03:14] <sunbeam> I have a function inside document ready $('#subscribe_form').click(function() { .. }
[08:03:36] <sunbeam> for some reason it gets executed after loading the document
[08:03:38] <alexr2_> flaccid, if it's returning anything, then it's working
[08:03:40] <sunbeam> how come? can i fix this someway
[08:03:41] <alexr2_> you'd get an error otherwise
[08:04:10] <alexr2_> sunbeam, jsfiddle.net
[08:08:24] <GoGGo> Hi guys, Is it possible to create an ajax request with input file and text ? 
[08:08:48] <alexr2_> I don't understnad your question GoGGo
[08:09:46] <GoGGo> I mean, I have a form with multipart/form-data text and file
[08:09:54] <ninja> I'm doing some css positioning with jQuery based on whether Div 1 is greater in height than its horizontal neighbour, Div 2. There are about 4 instances like this that I need to compare and then apply the calculated style (padding, in this case.) The problem I'm running into is that each instance uses the same classes, and so the calculation one one is being applied to all four. Does anyone know how to get around this??
[08:10:07] <alexr2_> GoGGo http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[08:10:34] <alexr2_> ninja, add an id around each instance
[08:10:43] <alexr2_> that way you can specify which one to modify specifically
[08:11:27] <spacemonkey> GoGGo: You're using pjax right? Anyone here know the easy/clean way to deal with multipart POST operations with pjax?
[08:11:27] <alexr2_> and have somethign like... var id_to_modify = "#first"; $(id_to_modify + " .classname1").css....
[08:11:36] <ninja> alexr2_, thanks - I was going to do that, but didn't want to have to create more script for each instance since the number of these will vary from page to page.
[08:11:47] <GoGGo> Yeah, I'm using pjax
[08:13:02] <spacemonkey> GoGGo: So what is happening, are the POST operations not happening?
[08:13:20] <alexr2_> ninja, did you read the second thing i wrote?
[08:13:48] <ninja> I see - let me chew on that
[08:16:35] <GoGGo> spacemonkey: the Post operation is sending only text data but for the input type file no data is sent
[08:18:22] <ninja> alexr2_, so I could do that and wrap it up in an each function I expect
[08:21:56] <ninja> if I put something through an each function, can I get jQuery to identify the unique ID of a div based on it having a specific class?
[08:22:25] <b-lew> alexr2_ its this line that is duplicating everythingâ¦
[08:22:25] <b-lew> var clone = element.clone().appendTo(element.parent()).attr('id','grid_clone');
[08:22:34] <Brodingo_> ninja yes
[08:23:45] <alexr2_> b-lew, so it's creating 2 ids per page?
[08:23:51] <alexr2_> that's dumb :-P  that's not valid html
[08:23:56] <b-lew> I think so yea
[08:24:04] <alexr2_> bad plugin :-P
[08:24:06] <b-lew> is there a way to alter that var to fix that?
[08:24:51] <alexr2_> umm, if you're okay with it being html5, you can change all the id to data-id
[08:24:54] <alexr2_> and hope that works
[08:25:09] <b-lew> haha okay
[08:25:16] <alexr2_> but you're literally rewriting the plugin at this point
[08:25:37] <b-lew> oh i don't care as long as it works
[08:25:47] <b-lew> i'm just using it for a HTML page
[08:25:53] <b-lew> i'm not using wordpress
[08:26:03] <alexr2_> that's not even a wordpress issue
[08:26:07] <alexr2_> it's just a badly written plugin
[08:26:11] <b-lew> that template author for some reason put that plugin in there for the thumbnail categories
[08:26:44] <alexr2_> it's probably better off being a class rather than data-id
[08:27:41] <b-lew> i think i can change that let me try that
[08:29:06] <MysterOnyx> is it true that I can just add async: false to an $.ajax function to avoid timing issues?
[08:29:30] <alexr2_> masteronyx, yes... but that defeats the purpose of ajax requests :-P
[08:30:16] <MysterOnyx> alexr2_ all I want to do is fill a javascript array with some data from a mysql table via php.. I can't figure another way other than using the ajax function
[08:31:09] <GoGGo> alexr2_:http://pastium.org/view/72862111cb504d138667949fc14d3704   Here is an example, the form saves only <input id="UsersUsername" type="text" value="goggo" name="username" />
[08:31:31] <ThiefMaster> why, oh WHY does the example at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#entry-examples pass a string as `data` instead of an object?
[08:32:40] <ajpiano> ThiefMaster: good lord
[08:32:58] <quicksilver> GoGGo: you can't use form.serialize to send file inputs.
[08:33:27] <quicksilver> GoGGo: strictly speaking you can't send file inputs by ajax at all, but people use IFRAME techniques to get around it.
[08:33:35] <ThiefMaster> ajpiano: 99% of the people (at least those asking stuff on stackoverflow) do not care about escaping stuff when passing a string
[08:33:45] <ThiefMaster> so imho people should pass an object unless they really know what they are doing
[08:33:48] <ajpiano> ThiefMaster: i meant good lord, that's terrible
[08:33:51] <ajpiano> i'm going to fix it right now :
[08:33:55] <ThiefMaster> ah
[08:33:56] <ThiefMaster> ty
[08:33:59] <quicksilver> if you google "jquery pjax file upload" you will get plenty of hits.
[08:34:09] <ninja> Can someone look at http://jsfiddle.net/6uDUr/ and see if I'm on the right track??
[08:34:12] <quicksilver> ajpiano: you never answered me the other day :P
[08:34:21] <MysterOnyx> hmm.. I set ajax to async:false, but it still tells me that the array is undefined
[08:34:22] <ThiefMaster> var menuId = $("ul.nav").first().attr("id");
[08:34:27] <ThiefMaster> .prop() would probably be better, wouldn't it?
[08:34:30] <ajpiano> quicksilver: you know i do things like leave the house or go away from the computer right
[08:34:38] <quicksilver> ajpiano: terrible, terrible.
[08:34:52] <quicksilver> ajpiano: I just wanted to know what the javascript was you used for your funky online slides.
[08:35:31] <ajpiano> oh
[08:35:38] <ajpiano> it's the html slides from slides.html5rocks.com
[08:36:53] <quicksilver> ajpiano: nice
[08:37:04] <GoGGo> quicksilver: thanks
[08:38:28] <b-lew> ahh this line of code is stupid
[08:41:55] <ninja> Can someone look at http://jsfiddle.net/6uDUr/ and see if I'm on the right track??
[08:43:00] <alexr2_> ninja, that will always choose the first class that has section-container class
[08:43:05] <alexr2_> not for each individual one
[08:43:14] <toddWork> i need to send a fairly big object through POST, is there a way to measure the "weight" in memory of an obj?
[08:43:30] <ninja> d'oh. I thought the each would run the code for each instance of section-container
[08:43:38] <toddWork> it's a weeks worth of twitter data so i'm sure i'm not near the limit (i hope) but i'm curious.
[08:43:49] <ctk> So I have a JSON object. One of the values returned is a function name. I wonder is there a way to validate that it's a function that exists?
[08:44:09] <alexr2_> if (typeof varname == "function")
[08:44:22] <ctk> i didn't think that function was a value
[08:44:29] <ctk> must have been looking at an old resource
[08:44:44] <alexr2_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
[08:44:58] <ctk> this article must be old :)
[08:45:15] <ctk> but that is most excellent. thanks
[08:45:43] <alexr2_> no problem
[08:46:20] <EdwardIII> hey
[08:46:21] <b-lew> anyone know of a jquery sort plugin that doesn't duplicate whats under the parent id?
[08:46:47] <EdwardIII> i'm trying to access some objects with ids like 'a:b', but i'm not having much luck: $('#billing:firstname').val('hello?');
[08:47:46] * webdev backslap b-lew
[08:47:55] <alexr2_> edwardIII that's not a valid id
[08:48:02] <b-lew> hummm
[08:48:04] <EdwardIII> ah, escape it
[08:48:07] <EdwardIII> a\\:b
[08:49:52] <alexr2_> EdwardIII, i'd change your ids... you're gonna run into errors
[08:51:51] <ninja> I totally got it. http://jsfiddle.net/6uDUr/1/ and it is working in page.
[08:53:41] <alexr2_> neato, good job
[08:53:42] <dabear> ninja: lol
[08:53:55] <ninja> hey, that's big for me.
[08:54:04] <dabear> for each $('.section-container') you are doing 6 dom lookups
[08:54:12] <ninja> is there a better way?
[08:55:31] <dabear> don't know how the html looks, but you could at least start from a common parent
[08:55:57] <dabear> either var $this = $(this); $this.find(".left") etc
[08:56:04] <RingZer0> so, I am using a setInterval() ... how do I pass $ (jquery) to my function inited as a var?
[08:56:27] <dabear> or var $container = $('#' + (this).id + '.section-container'); and then $container.find(".left") etc
[08:56:54] <ninja> cool. Let me try that.
[08:56:56] <RingZer0> e.g. var rotate = function($){ $('selector').remove(); } ;  setInterval(rotate,4000); --> produces error of $ not being defined.
[08:57:47] <RingZer0> all of this is inside jQuery(document).ready(function($){ ... });
[08:57:51] <alexr2_> RingZer0, your function expects a parameter to be passed in
[08:57:54] <alexr2_> you're naming it $
[08:58:22] <alexr2_> you're overriding the jquery $ so locally, $ is not jquery
[08:58:23] <RingZer0> understood.  passing args using set timeout is a bit confusing.
[08:58:30] <alexr2_> there's no need to do that
[08:58:34] <RingZer0> gotcha
[08:58:35] <alexr2_> var rotate = function() { $('....
[08:58:37] <dabear> ninja: could probably strip everying out and add css classes, but keep the padding-top part
[08:58:38] <RingZer0> cause its in local scope
[08:58:40] <RingZer0> gotcha
[08:58:41] <alexr2_> and you shouldn't have a problem
[08:58:47] * RingZer0 thanks alexr2_ 
[08:58:48] <alexr2_> or actually pass jquery in
[08:58:56] <RingZer0> was overthinking it.
[08:59:06] <alexr2_> yep
[09:03:31] <ninja> dabear, would that container.find idea replace the each function?
[09:04:56] <dabear> no, not as it is now
[09:05:21] <dabear> point is, do as little as possible in js
[09:05:33] <dabear> a simple class addition for example
[09:05:46] <dabear> and then use that class in css
[09:10:49] <Apoleon> Heyall! Just a quick question: I want my jQuery to be up-to-date and I want it to be easy to update. I thought of building a script, which would download the most recent version and then save it on my server. Simple enough. The problem is that there seems not to be a link which would provide the most recent version, but all the links have version numbers in them.
[09:11:14] <Apoleon> so, is there a permanent download link available, such as www.query.com/most:_recent.js
[09:11:24] <Apoleon> ignoring the typos in the address :)
[09:11:36] <NoiseEee> Apoleon: you can use the google cdn, but just heads up on backwards compatibility
[09:11:50] <ajpiano> Apoleon: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
[09:11:53] <Apoleon> but google cdn links have the version number in themn too
[09:11:58] <Apoleon> ajpiano <3 thanks!
[09:12:18] <ajpiano> Apoleon: or http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js
[09:12:24] <ajpiano> but they cache really badly
[09:12:40] <ajpiano> Apoleon: pulling in a new version of jquery to your site in production without testing it is not exactly what we call "wise" in the business
[09:12:57] <rroelofs> I have an odd one.  Someone in our local webdev group was trying to use :contains to find paragraphs with embedded html code snippets.  he discovered that looking for p:contains(<div>) didn't find the paragraph but p:contains(<div) did.  Is this a known issue?  http://jsfiddle.net/DPHDv/3/
[09:13:07] <Apoleon> ajpiano I'm not doing that. I just want the download to be easy and fast. testing is of course done before release
[09:15:05] <Apoleon> thanks all, I'm off to developing again
[09:15:16] * webdev backslaps rroelofs
[09:15:45] <MysterOnyx> I'm using jquery UI's autocomplete to populate an array (object) with data from the autocomplete. After this occurs, I want to populate another array with data from another table. I receive the data from autocomplete fine, but the data from the 2nd table is not working. I'm using a separate getJSON call, and the reason why it's not working is because I'm trying to run the code synchronously.
[09:15:45] <MysterOnyx> I'm not sure how to set this up to handle the asynchronous nature of getJSON. I've looked at many tutorials and can't seem to figure how to put all of my code into the callback.
[09:16:46] <webdev> laters
[09:21:49] <blackice2999> hi @all, has someone for me a idea how i can select all select elements that are NOT in a specific div. Example (not working): $('div:not(.hierarchical-select) select')
[09:23:00] <blackice2999> the structure can be: <div class="hierarchical-select"><select....></div>  or <div><select>...</div> i dont want the first select.
[09:24:14] <johnkpaul> jQuery("div:not(.hierarchical-select)").find("select")
[09:24:24] <johnkpaul> @blackice2999
[09:25:52] <MysterOnyx> is there a way to populate a global array with getJSON without having to put the rest of your code, functions, etc inside of the callback?
[09:26:12] <MysterOnyx> by rest of code I mean all code that occurs after the getJSON is run
[09:26:25] <EyePulp> yo ho ho -- I'm trying to figure out the best way to describe the effect I'm looking for so I can search google a little more effectively, and I'm hoping you kind folks can help. =)
[09:27:24] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: you can use jquery deferreds to make it seem like that's not the case, but everything that happens with the data of a get json has to, by defintion, happen after the call returns
[09:27:41] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: http://joseoncode.com/2011/09/26/a-walkthrough-jquery-deferred-and-promise/
[09:27:54] <MysterOnyx> thanks
[09:27:56] <EyePulp> I want to slide some content horizontally, inside elements on a page.  I don't want them to appear to be squished, just have them appear to slide left or right and disappear under the elements to their right or left, without collapsing the space between.
[09:28:24] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: like carousels?
[09:28:25] <EyePulp> sort of a carousel effect?
[09:28:28] <jerry_> is anyone aware that sometimes when you use accordion that screen flickers becayse background colors are very dark?
[09:28:37] <johnkpaul> what's the difference between that and a carousel effect, EyePulp?
[09:28:45] <EyePulp> johnkpaul: yessir - I think that may be it.
[09:28:56] <EyePulp> the term occurred to me after I typed all of that. =)
[09:28:59] <johnkpaul> :) well I definitely helped a lot
[09:29:08] <johnkpaul> ha
[09:29:20] * EyePulp blames it on friday.
[09:29:27] <johnkpaul> eh, sometimes you just have to get it out
[09:29:49] <EyePulp> okay, anyone have any lightweight carousel widgets for html content they recommend?
[09:30:19] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul can I simply put the getJSON in a separate function and then call the function when I need to populate the global array?
[09:30:20] <EyePulp> thanks johnkpaul.  You're my development rabbits foot.
[09:30:55] <johnkpaul> np, jcarousellite
[09:31:13] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: you can, but the next line of code will not have that global array populated
[09:31:21] <johnkpaul> because that will only be populated in the future
[09:31:30] <johnkpaul> after the async call is fun
[09:31:39] <johnkpaul> ha, /fun/finished
[09:32:26] <blackice2999> johnkpaul: thanks for your answer. Currently code:  $('div:not(.hierarchical-select)', context).find('select') dont work :( it selects the select
[09:32:46] <johnkpaul> ?:not
[09:32:47] <bot-t> :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[09:33:32] <johnkpaul> hm, you shouldn't use the context, but it should work, can you make sure that the divs returned from the first selector call don't have any heirarchicalcontent in them
[09:35:01] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul let's say I have a webpage with a button. Everytime I click that button, more data from a table is added to a global array. a table displaying the data is then updated. However, I also have another button that when clicked, simply multiplies the values in the table by 2. From what people are telling me, when I click the first button, I need to put the load table function inside its
[09:35:01] <MysterOnyx> getJSON callback. The problem is, when I click the 2nd button, I'm not using getJSON. All I want the 2nd button to do is multiply values in the array and then reload the table. This is why I'm having trouble with the idea of putting my buildtable function inside the getJSON callback if other functions need to run it
[09:35:16] <johnkpaul> wow you type fast

It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.

[09:42:32] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul, I've only pasted a few of the functions so you can get the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/FUNC8/1/
[09:43:03] <johnkpaul> hmm, that's a lot of code
[09:43:17] <MysterOnyx> yea maybe I should just type up a basic thing so you get the idea
[09:43:22] <MysterOnyx> one sec
[09:43:24] <johnkpaul> yeah, that would be better
[09:43:52] <johnkpaul> also, let me recommend this to you, MysterOnyx http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[09:44:13] <blackice2999> johnkpaul: i got my solution now on reverse way i select first the "selects" and then i check for the parent i think it will be faster than search in a lot of div elements or what do you think about ?
[09:44:52] <johnkpaul> I don't know which is more performant, my guess is that the opposite would be faster though, use jsperf.com to test
[09:45:09] <blackice2999> ah cool thanks for the idea
[09:45:20] <blackice2999> johnkpaul: thank you so much

[09:47:26] <ArexBawrin> johnkpaul: thank you
[09:47:30] <johnkpaul> no problem
[09:47:54] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul, here's a simplified version. When jquery UI's autocomplete gets a selection, I want to alert the value of object weight, which is done in getWeight(). That's where the getJSON is used to populate getWeight. After that alert, display() is called, which calls getOptions(), which also alerts weight. As you can see, I have multiple functions that need to access weight's data. Every time
[09:47:54] <MysterOnyx> autocomplete occurs, more data will be added to the weight object. http://jsfiddle.net/FUNC8/2/
[09:49:03] <MysterOnyx> but at the moment, I get the error that weight is undefined when alerted under autocomplete select: and in getOptions()
[09:49:18] <sodapop> johnkpaul, yes also tried :button, is it correct ?
[09:49:26] <sodapop> both?
[09:49:50] <MysterOnyx> I understand that it's an asynchronous issue, but I'm not sure how to organize the functions so they can all access weight's data

[09:57:29] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: no problem
[09:58:44] <johnkpaul> avdeveloper: so what is the problem, it is jsonp
[09:58:54] <johnkpaul> does the url actually support jsonp?
[09:58:56] <ctk> trying to read a value from some json which is the name of a function and then call that function
[09:59:06] <johnkpaul> ctk: what's the issue in that code?
[09:59:10] <avdeveloper> ok so I don't get the error, but the responseText I get back is null
[09:59:16] <ctk> it doesn't seem to fire the function
[09:59:22] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul is there a simpler way to populate the weight array than using getJSON?

[10:01:51] <johnkpaul> ?g jsonp
[10:01:52] <bot-t> johnkpaul, JSONP - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[10:02:23] <johnkpaul> ctk: it's a hoisting issue
[10:02:37] <johnkpaul> which are always confusing to me, and I Have to think a lot to work through them
[10:02:43] <johnkpaul> expclitly assign blah to window and it should be fine
[10:03:05] <avdeveloper> ah I see now
[10:03:09] <avdeveloper> thanks johnkpaul!
[10:03:43] <MysterOnyx> forget ron paul, nominate john paul
[10:04:26] <johnkpaul> :) if only I was into politics
[10:04:30] <johnkpaul> you're welcome avdeveloper, have fun
[10:04:46] <avdeveloper> thx
[10:05:03] <MysterOnyx> it's not hard, john, just pretend you know what you're talking about, convince people to vote for you, and reep the benefits
[10:05:35] <ctk> @johnkpaul: thanks. that does help, but I'm not sure i want to assign to window object. i'll have to this this through.
[10:05:45] <ctk> *think
[10:06:08] <johnkpaul> oh, I assumed you wanted it on the window object because you were checking for window[step.load]
[10:06:12] <johnkpaul> you don't _need_ it there
[10:06:28] <ctk> this is the only way I nkow how other than eval()
[10:07:06] <ctk> you have any ideas for how to call a function when all I have is the name as a string?
[10:07:33] <ctk> or as a string representation of the function? such as "myFunc()"
[10:09:16] <johnkpaul> you can store the function in any object, it doesn't have to be window
[10:11:05] <jerry_> anyone want to help me with him example so to make each section collapsable.expandable
[10:11:21] <jerry_> http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/1/
[10:11:46] <ctk> jerry_: include jquery ui
[10:12:03] <ctk> and it works
[10:12:36] <jerry_> ctk: how to i make it as default to not show first section expanded?
[10:13:15] <ctk> jerry_ you want them all collapsed?
[10:13:37] <jerry_> yes but now when page loads first section is expanded by default
[10:15:47] <jerry_> ctk: you see how right now section 1 is already expanded http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/6/
[10:16:44] <ninja> are there any highyl recommend jquery plugins for achieving elements rotations in older versions of IE?
[10:17:03] <johnkpaul> ninja: you might want to check PIE
[10:17:08] <johnkpaul> I don't know if it supports rotations though
[10:17:15] <MrPunkin> Is there a way to test if an element has a css-specified height without getting the calculated height?
[10:18:20] <jerry_> ctk: i want each section to be expandable and collapsable but i dont want when user loads the page to see any section expanded until user clicks on one of them
[10:18:32] <ctk> checking.
[10:19:37] <Jon47> MrPunkin: there might be but my instinct is that whatever problem you're trying to solve has a more elegant solution..
[10:20:11] <ctk> jerry_: http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/1/
[10:20:43] <jerry_> ctk: thats same as i had
[10:20:53] <jerry_> it stil shows section first when it loads
[10:22:01] <warrenparsons> MrPunkin: Nothing obvious. If you can describe what you want to do with the value it might help us help you.
[10:22:29] <MrPunkin> warrenparsons, Jon47: I think if I just re-think my solution I can come up with something better. Thanks though.

[10:25:58] <AeroNotix> I can't seem to chain .fadeIn().html(htmlstr);
[10:26:00] <johnkpaul> what just happened
[10:26:23] <jerry_> kborchers: thanks so much
[10:27:14] <warrenparsons> AeroNotix: Are you trying to have .html() execute after .fadeIn() has finished?
[10:27:30] <AeroNotix> warrenparsons: yeah, I've just worked out what I'm doing wrong, thanks!
[10:30:13] <MysterOnyx> hey johnkpaul, when .done(alert) occurs, it says the variable is undefined: http://jsfiddle.net/7GQqD/
[10:30:43] <MysterOnyx> I don't get any other errors
[10:30:43] <johnkpaul> done takes a function as an argument, not undefined
[10:30:49] <johnkpaul> alert() returns undefined
[10:30:59] <johnkpaul> you want to wrap that alert with a function
[10:31:00] <Jarred_Keeper> Morning all.
[10:31:05] <MysterOnyx> oh ok, thanks
[10:31:08] <johnkpaul> and alert the first argument of that function
[10:31:11] <johnkpaul> which will be what you resolved it with
[10:33:17] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul, is this what you mean? http://jsfiddle.net/7GQqD/1/
[10:33:49] <jerry_> kborchers: why is it giving so much white space when you expand section?
[10:34:28] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: http://jsfiddle.net/7GQqD/2/
[10:37:35] <jerry_> kborchers: stil there:)
[10:37:45] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul, what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/7GQqD/3/
[10:38:37] <kborchers> jerry_: http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/21/
[10:38:47] <kborchers> jerry_: also see ?accordion
[10:38:48] <bot-t> jerry_, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[10:38:51] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: display returns undefined, so it's exactly the same problem as before
[10:38:53] <kborchers> not that one
[10:39:02] <kborchers> jerry_: see ?ui.accordion
[10:39:02] <bot-t> jerry_, http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[10:39:23] <jerry_> kborchers: bot-t ok i will...thank you for help
[10:39:40] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul I was under the impression that once .done() took place, weight would be defined globally
[10:40:07] <MysterOnyx> but apparently it's still undefined
[10:40:25] <johnkpaul> that's true, but done doesn't happen when line 14 has finished executed
[10:40:39] <johnkpaul> it happens in the future
[10:40:43] <johnkpaul> when the getjson call is completed
[10:41:05] <johnkpaul> also, .done(display()) means call display and give the return value of display to done
[10:41:10] <johnkpaul> but display returns nothing
[10:41:16] <johnkpaul> which is returning undefined
[10:41:25] <johnkpaul> so you're saying .done(undefined) which doesn't make sense
[10:42:45] <MysterOnyx> I have the same problem I started with. done() is happening in the future
[10:42:49] <Teduardo> anyone know why this doesn't make a box pop up?
[10:42:50] <Teduardo> http://pastebin.com/xLdUtXan
[10:43:11] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: there's no way around that
[10:43:17] <johnkpaul> that's what asynchroncity is
[10:43:25] <johnkpaul> but you can strucutre your code diferently, so it isn't as painful
[10:43:32] <EyePulp> $('.foo:visible')  will pick all the visible elements with a class of foo, yeah?
[10:43:43] <johnkpaul> ?:visible
[10:43:43] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[10:44:46] <MysterOnyx> johnkpaul I was trying to do async:false earlier with $.ajax, but that wasn't working
[10:45:26] <johnkpaul> jsonp doesn't have that option
[10:45:38] <MysterOnyx> I thought json and jsonp were different
[10:45:39] <EyePulp> excellent
[10:45:40] <johnkpaul> MysterOnyx: the deferred/promise pattern is a little difficult at first
[10:45:47] <johnkpaul> but once you get it, it is a lot easier
[10:45:52] <johnkpaul> as is with eerything I suppose
[10:46:54] <Jarred_Keeper> good gods..
[10:47:07] <Jarred_Keeper> it's been so long i've forgotten how to log into this supid thing
[10:53:02] <totimkopf> dudes, how do I pass json data around that I get from AJAX?
[10:54:33] <Jon47> totimkopf: $.parseJSON
[10:55:00] <Jon47> will use eval if your browser doesn't natively support JSON/you haven't manually loaded it
[10:55:58] <totimkopf> Jon47, cool, thanks man
[10:58:07] <Teduardo> does anyone know how you can make jqueryui dialog open on load?
[11:00:54] <gehsekky> Teduardo: autoopen: true

[11:01:12] <gehsekky> Teduardo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-show
[11:03:03] <wuwoot> I have two links: USA and Canada, is there a way to fill a <div id="states">__need_matching_states_here__</div> with the correct info? I tried using replaceWith, but it just removes the entire div and when I click the other country nothing happens
[11:03:56] <johnkpaul> ?html @wuwoot

[11:05:56] <catcher> What's the best element/event to delegate to recognize a click anywhere *but* a certain element?
[11:06:10] <gehsekky> Teduardo: you have a syntax error on line 15
[11:06:14] <catcher> I want to close a popup box when a click goes anywhere else. Will focus/blur work?
[11:06:24] <gehsekky> remove the semicolon from line 14
[11:07:24] <DannyZB> catcher : first of all you have to give that popup a tab-index
[11:07:31] <DannyZB> otherwise you can't focus on it in the first place
[11:07:48] <DannyZB> and it would only work if the other element clicked is also focusable ( has a tab-index)
[11:07:59] <Teduardo> gehsekky: ah still doesn't open... weird
[11:10:08] <Blaster> hey if I have <select name="someName[13]">  how could I extract just the 13?  I have this much... $('select').change(function() { $(this).attr('name') }); which returns the someName[13]  but I just want the 13

[11:10:18] * DannyZB loves plug-ins baby
[11:11:02] <DannyZB> Blaster : I dunno if there's a better way but you can always just use regular javascript ( .substring )
[11:11:15] <ravenzz> ?replace
[11:11:17] <bot-t> ravenzz, .replaceWith() - Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[11:11:22] <ravenzz> no that one
[11:11:26] <ravenzz> effing bawt
[11:11:43] <ravenzz> Blaster is someName static?
[11:11:49] <Blaster> ravenzz: yes
[11:12:02] <ravenzz> replace it then with an empty string
[11:12:19] <Blaster> can't jquery parse a form array names though?
[11:12:59] <Teduardo> This is what i'm trying to get to work, does anyone have any ideas?

[11:14:29] <warrenparsons> Teduardo: Nevermind. Saw the checkbox. Doh
[11:15:00] <DannyZB> ravenzz : cool , didn't know that one
[11:15:09] <Teduardo> can't be this hard to get a box to pop up =)
[11:16:07] <warrenparsons> Teduardo: Why do you have backslashes before the quotes?
[11:16:30] <warrenparsons> Teduardo: You've also got a trailing comma after your buttons param. That'll cause problems in IE.
[11:16:38] <Teduardo> oh, because it's being created in PHP, but i'll remove those.. right now I have devolved into just trying to get it to work
[11:17:02] <DannyZB> and you're missing one " ; "
[11:17:34] <warrenparsons> Teduardo: And this may be the big one - $dialog.dialog('open'); In the code provided, you're not defining $dialog anywhere.
[11:17:56] <catcher> DannyZB, my research into tab-index is showing a lot of jquery-UI stuff, aside from the html attribute that defines tab key operation.
[11:18:53] <catcher> Seems it should be more straightforward to close a box when I click elsewhere (like pandora's purchase box, for example)
[11:19:24] <DannyZB> catcher : I used it A LOT in the past for custom windowing systems .. it works perfect in all browsers and has nothing to do with JQueryUI
[11:19:38] <DannyZB> just because it's not so commonly used it's a bit hard to find instructions
[11:19:54] <DannyZB> I have code for that but it's buried in heaps of other code  (:
[11:19:56] <catcher> I see, so you are indeed referring to the attribute used to define tabbing order?
[11:19:59] <catcher> ha
[11:20:21] <DannyZB> Maybe I'll opensource it if my current opensource project goes well (:
[11:21:15] <Teduardo> warrenparsons can you give me a hint as to where I need to do that? sorry I am just modifying the example
[11:22:04] <DannyZB> I don't remember much about dialogs ... why is the dialog appearing as an ugly button+text with no borders ? isn't the CSS included in JSFiddle ?
[11:22:21] <warrenparsons> Teduardo: I don't work much with UI, so this is kind of a guess - http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/9zGMP/3/

[11:33:18] <MysterOnyx> I've decided to try $.ajax() async:false for now, but it's still running asynchronously, can someone help me out?
[11:33:48] <alexr2__> MysterOnyx, what are you trying to do/how are you doing it currently.  http://jsfiddle.net
[11:34:51] <MysterOnyx> alex2__, here's what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCJPx/
[11:34:55] <MysterOnyx> the alert returns undefined
[11:35:50] <MysterOnyx> I thought that by setting it to async:false, the alert would happen after $.ajax() has received a response
[11:36:09] <alexr2__> the things inside the $.each loop are local to the loop
[11:36:09] <catcher> Is there anything I can use in place of .has() for jquery < 1.4?
[11:36:12] <alexr2__> they don't exist outside of it
[11:36:43] <MysterOnyx> alex2__ even when I set values to the global object weight, those weight values don't exist outside of the each's?
[11:37:28] <DannyZB> motherf*IWh8*& internet
[11:39:00] <alexr2__> MysterOnyx, try something for me... alert(data)
[11:39:07] <blackice2999> ?.filter
[11:39:07] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[11:39:27] <MysterOnyx> alexr2__ outside of the ajax at the end?
[11:39:35] <alexr2__> Yes
[11:39:44] <alexr2__> rather set it to a global variable
[11:39:46] <alexr2__> and then do the alert
[11:39:56] <MysterOnyx> data is not defined
[11:40:08] <alexr2__> so success : function (data) { window[temp] = data }  and then outside the ajax call, alert(temp)
[11:40:36] <enapupe> Hi, is there any easy/light way to use webkit animate where avaiable, instead of animate()?
[11:41:49] <enapupe> The issue is: I was working with *{transition:ease all etc} but it conflicts with jquery animate().. makes everything heavy and slow
[11:42:22] <enapupe> maybe a few modernizr ifs can solve this
[11:42:36] <MysterOnyx> alex2__ hmm... this time it seemed to wait for the ajax to complete and then returned [object Object],[object Object],[object Object],
[11:42:42] <alexr2__> okay
[11:42:47] <alexr2__> $.each is async as well
[11:42:50] <alexr2__> do a regular for loop
[11:43:11] <MysterOnyx> ok I'll try that, thanks
[11:46:28] <DannyZB> LOL my testing server just got hacked

[11:47:51] <DannyZB> oh.. "in the name of Allah " .. now that makes more sense
[11:48:53] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: You got served!
[11:49:14] <DannyZB> served what exactly ?
[11:49:24] <warrenparsons> Dunno
[11:49:25] <DannyZB> it's like someone stealking sawdust from a carpenter
[11:49:31] <DannyZB> stealing *
[11:49:52] <EyePulp> heh
[11:50:14] <DannyZB> the funny thing about these islamic "hackers" ( script kitties ) is that they're doing israel a huge favor lol
[11:50:15] <EyePulp> you can make a nice filler out of sawdust & wood glue -it's not entirely worthless
[11:50:16] <warrenparsons> He probably thinks he's a true badass because he used some script to hack a site called online-vault along with infecting his computer with a botnet.
[11:50:24] <DannyZB> the web security is awful
[11:50:45] <DannyZB> all these hackings are forcing websites to use more secure systems (:
[11:50:51] <DannyZB> lol yea
[11:51:45] <DannyZB> Now I can't show off my jQuery plugin .. bummer
[11:51:55] <EyePulp> It's a very dramatic hoodie pic he posted.  Black background too.  this guy is oozing 1337.
[11:52:11] <warrenparsons> I'm scared.
[11:52:25] <DannyZB> I handled guys like him in the army all the time
[11:52:32] <DannyZB> they're tough until dad shows up (:

[11:56:20] <lvh> Hello :)
[11:57:02] <Rickih> O.o
[11:57:38] <DannyZB> nobody has jquery problems today
[11:57:40] <DannyZB> I'm bored
[11:57:46] <DannyZB> ruin some working code for me to fix
[11:58:27] <lvh> I have a few span.editable with data-attr attributes. I also have an edit button. I'd like to replace the spans with inputs when the edit button is clicked
[11:58:51] <DannyZB> whats the problem ?
[11:59:01] <lvh> I'm guessing that's with after/insertAfter?
[11:59:08] <DannyZB> exactly
[11:59:41] <lvh> I'm using parent.find(".editable").each (idx, element) -> # that's coffeescript, hope that's okay
[12:00:06] <lvh> That gives me the idx, which I don't want, and the element instead of a jquery selector. Does that mean each is the wrong thing to use?
[12:00:28] <DannyZB> whats coffescript ?
[12:00:54] <DannyZB> and you can easily make a jquery object out of an element
[12:00:57] <lvh> DannyZB: It's Javascript but nicer. It compiles down to JS: http://coffeescript.org/
[12:00:59] <DannyZB> $( element ) -> jquery object
[12:01:08] <DannyZB> we only speak jQuery here (:
[12:01:12] <lvh> DannyZB: Yes, but I hear that repeated $(...) is a bad idea performance-wise
[12:01:21] <lvh> Yes, it's still jquery :)
[12:01:28] <lvh> In fact, I'm calling it from JS ;)
[12:01:38] <DannyZB> if it's not a jquery object but an element .. thats exactly whats needed
[12:01:44] <blindMoe> hola

[12:13:07] <wuwoot> is there a way to reset all events or default them when another is triggered?
[12:13:29] <wuwoot> for example I have a menu that utilizes onclick event
[12:13:35] <wuwoot> home | about us
[12:13:47] <wuwoot> when i click on about us, I want home to slide back up
[12:15:00] <DannyZB> what does "slide back" have anything to do with resetting events ?
[12:15:12] <wuwoot> i'm not exactly sure i'm using the right terms, Danny
[12:15:33] <wuwoot> but i'm currently using the method slideDown on both the buttons
[12:15:59] <wuwoot> and when the page loads the lists for each menu item is hidden
[12:16:54] <DannyZB> you mean you're writing a dropdown ??
[12:17:12] <wuwoot> yea
[12:18:09] <DannyZB> slideDown then slideUp whats the problem
[12:18:46] <wuwoot> let's say I have two buttons: "about us" and "events"
[12:19:01] <wuwoot> what you're telling me is that the user must click about us twice
[12:19:15] <wuwoot> to send the menu below it back to it's default state of being hidden
[12:19:29] <DannyZB> yes
[12:19:33] <wuwoot> i don't want htat
[12:19:36] <DannyZB> either that or he clicks another menu item
[12:19:38] <wuwoot> what i need to have happen is
[12:19:41] <wuwoot> correct
[12:19:45] <wuwoot> when events is clicked
[12:19:46] <DannyZB> ohhh thats easy
[12:19:52] <DannyZB> make a class for slide menus
[12:19:59] <DannyZB> like ".dropdown"
[12:20:23] <DannyZB> then $(".dropdown").not(".dropped").slideUp();
[12:20:32] <DannyZB> then $(".dropped").slideDown
[12:20:47] <wuwoot> awesome! precisely what i was looking for
[12:21:06] <DannyZB> the not code is probably incorrect syntax lol
[12:21:26] <wuwoot> i'll figure it out. thanks.
[12:21:37] <DannyZB> nope it's correct just checked
[12:21:38] <DannyZB> np
[12:22:39] <mulinux> hi guys, what for framework would you recommend to extend jquery with real mvc ?
[12:25:40] <tocka> hey guys
[12:25:46] <tocka> how could i do this thing
[12:26:15] <tocka> if($A == #CSS ID){add_class_active}
[12:26:17] <tocka> ?
[12:26:17] <tocka> ;/
[12:26:59] <DannyZB> whats #CSS ID ?
[12:27:09] <tocka> just an ID of a div
[12:27:18] <tocka> its for a parallax slider
[12:27:29] <DannyZB> you're super unclear
[12:27:53] <rroelofs> what is the contents of $A?
[12:28:36] <rroelofs> if it is a jquery object you can get the id of the first element as $A[0].id...
[12:28:41] <tocka> I have slider, when I press on a button it slides down but it doesnt show that which button is active. So I want to add a style to it lets say class="active".
[12:28:47] <jovrtn> if ($('#element').attr('id') === $A) {   $('#element').addClass('active')   }
[12:29:17] <tocka> Thank you!
[12:29:40] <DannyZB> wow ... I'm genuinely impressed you understood what he wanted
[12:30:30] <mulinux> somebody?
[12:30:53] <rroelofs> mulinux: I'm currently using backbone
[12:31:39] <DannyZB> mulinux : hate for MVC is one of the main reasons we use JQuery (:
[12:31:50] <DannyZB> but you can use backbone
[12:32:18] <rroelofs> Yeah, there's a reason I didn't choose SproutCore :-)
[12:35:14] <alexr2__> i love mvc :-P  i just don't like javascript mvc
[12:35:22] <mulinux> rroelofs, DannyZB, thx for your response
[12:35:34] <mulinux> what do you think about emberjs?
[12:35:48] <alexr2__> it's slow :-P
[12:36:02] <mulinux> really? is backbone faster?
[12:36:09] <alexr2__> dunno, never tried backbone
[12:36:26] <alexr2__> i just know it was taking 3-4 seconds just to get the ember stuff loaded
[12:37:17] <mulinux> ok
[12:37:18] <rroelofs> mulinux: I really liked Knockoutjs too.  I've never used emberjs.  Backbone seems to fit the minimal useful mvs
[12:37:45] <rroelofs> *mvc
[12:38:38] <rroelofs> For my current project I added backbone.modelbinding which bumped up the size a bit
[12:38:55] <DannyZB> what do google and yahoo use ?
[12:39:04] <DannyZB> their javascript apps are definitely quick
[12:39:21] <DannyZB> I think yahoo has some MVC framework ... Yii or smth
[12:39:23] <rroelofs> google lots of things like GWT.  yahoo uses YUI
[12:39:31] <DannyZB> yea YUI ..
[12:39:45] <rroelofs> GWT doesn't really count
[12:39:45] <DannyZB> jQuery wasn't made with MVC in mind , it's for coding purists
[12:40:35] <totimkopf> Jon47, hey bro you still around?
[12:40:45] <Jon47> sup
[12:40:58] <totimkopf> let me pastebin this, just a sec
[12:42:14] <totimkopf> http://pastebin.com/jTD7v8Aa
[12:42:29] <totimkopf> the object is null, don't know what I'm doing wrong
[12:45:03] <ParanoidGal> I know I've spoken about this with a few of you but hoping someone might be able to shed some light on this. My client is seeing images fading when clicking on the right arrow of slider at http://www.eliasentertainment.net
[12:45:21] <ParanoidGal> She's using Firefox and the mac and try as I might I can't recreate so finding it impossible to resolve
[12:45:21] <totimkopf> Jon47, if I do alert(data.captcha_is_good); it'll return the value I'm looking for, though
[12:45:30] <ParanoidGal> can anyone see the issue their end?
[12:46:01] <Jon47> totimkopf: it sounds like you can remove that parseJSON line then ;)
[12:46:23] <mulinux> thx for feedback guys, knockout look pretty cool, but it not a real mvc and the template engine seem to blow up
[12:46:29] <totimkopf> Jon47, yeah but, I need to be able to pass that data around ...I can't return it so I don't know what to do
[12:46:45] <Jon47> pass it around by calling callbacj functions
[12:46:50] <bambams> Is it normal to manipulate jQuery UI CSS classes yourself? :\ My colleagues seem to be doing a lot of it...
[12:46:50] <mulinux> do someone have experience with YUI ?
[12:47:17] <totimkopf> Jon47, could you provide a small example for me?
[12:47:17] <warrenparsons> ParanoidGal: No "fading" but it is kinda jumpy in FF 10/Mac. FF 11 is fine though.
[12:47:32] <xmaddness> bambams, I have had to in the past
[12:47:52] <bambams> e.g.,   var tabs = e.find(".foo").tabs(); tabs.addClass("ui-tabs-horizontal ui-helper-clearfix"); // WTF. :\
[12:48:40] <bambams> Even if you do need to manipulate them it should be done through an API, even if custom... But I imagine the jQuery UI API already does most, if not all, of this for you...
[12:48:55] <bambams> I can see working around bugs short term maybe, but not regular use like this..
[12:49:41] <DannyZB> mulinux : none .. but seeing as it comes from Yahoo which makes some pretty powerful apps I would guess it's pretty good
[12:50:22] <ParanoidGal> Thanks warrenparsons finding this pretty impossible problem to solve. Wouldn't normally use bought plugins bcos of it but client insisted!
[12:50:56] <warrenparsons> ParanoidGal: What version of FF is she using? If it's 3.x that might explain the problem, and leave a good argument for not fixing it.
[12:51:00] <DannyZB> btw , theres always MooTools
[12:52:13] <DannyZB> mulinux : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/394601/which-javascript-framework-jquery-vs-dojo-vs
[12:52:20] <xmaddness> bambams, The only reason I did it is because I needed to alter the standard behavior of a ui plugin
[12:52:32] <ParanoidGal> Warrenparson: She's bang up to date with FF 11 (though isn't at all technically minded so that's something of a miracle. She also hasn't got any extensions etc installed which rules out any conflict issue there
[12:52:38] <xmaddness> in particular the accordian plugin
[12:52:59] <mulinux> DannyZB: cool, thx for the link
[12:53:44] <warrenparsons> ParanoidGal: It sounds like an isolated issue. If neither you nor anyone else can reproduce it, it's not fixable. Might be worthwhile to have the client try on another computer for herself to better understand your situation.
[12:56:16] <ParanoidGal> warrenparsons: True true. In fact it doesn't have the issue on her partner's computer. It's just getting past the "but if I can see it then it's likely others can" argument
[12:56:32] <blackice2999> ?.end
[12:56:32] <bot-t> .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[12:57:04] <warrenparsons> ParanoidGal: Yeah, sometimes it's hard for a client to swallow that a perceived "bug" is just a problem with their individual machine.
[12:57:27] <warrenparsons> ParanoidGal: Maybe offer to format and reinstall her OS for a nominal fee :D
[12:57:59] <JCBK> if I have a grid of items, and I hide an amount of those by using fadeToggle, how would I let the other elements slide to their new place, instead of just "jumping"?
[12:59:04] <juventino> ciao
[12:59:08] <juventino> !list
[12:59:10] <ParanoidGal> warrenparsons I like your way of thinking!! Thanks for allthe advice and help
[12:59:11] <warrenparsons> JCBK: You'll have to either write that functionality manually or find a plugin that does what you want (if one exists).
[12:59:45] <warrenparsons> ParanoidGal: Sure thing. Of course what I'd probably try first is having her uninstall FF, delete/rename her profile for it, and reinstall.
[13:01:10] <ParanoidGal> warrenparsons I didn't even think of that. Will get her to try. Might be a touch hard seeing as she wouldn't clear her cache as she was sure it would remove all her bookmarks
[13:01:34] <DannyZB> ? californication
[13:01:36] <bot-t> DannyZB, Couldn't find "californication" in jQuery Docs.
[13:01:53] <DannyZB> bot doesn't know about californication !?:

[13:02:09] <bot-t> warrenparsons, Couldn't find "makethisdumbshitwork" in jQuery Docs.
[13:02:22] <DannyZB> ok this bot is broken
[13:02:28] <warrenparsons> Seriously.

[13:02:59] <DannyZB> How old is the gal who plays karen ?
[13:04:19] <lvh> DannyZB: I also need to set some data attrs on that thing. How can I get the *inserted* element?
[13:04:52] <superaragornlego> hihi, i would like to get a menu like the left one over at http://jqueryui.com/themeroller
[13:04:55] <superaragornlego> what is that one called?
[13:05:03] <DannyZB> give it an id or a class you can identify later or smth ..
[13:05:04] <superaragornlego> it looks like some different kind of "accordion"
[13:05:10] <lvh> .last?
[13:05:17] <DannyZB> one sec
[13:05:25] <DannyZB> you're replacing the old element or hiding it ?
[13:05:37] <jefvel> superaragornlego: wassup
[13:05:41] <lvh> Hiding the old element, placing an <input> after it
[13:05:45] <superaragornlego> hi hi it is me
[13:05:49] <DannyZB> so thats easy
[13:05:51] <jefvel> superaragornlego: cool
[13:05:55] <DannyZB> .next ()
[13:06:29] <DannyZB> * use .next on the original element you inserted after and you get the inserted element
[13:07:48] <superaragornlego> <superaragornlego> hihi, i would like to get a menu like the left one over at http://jqueryui.com/themeroller
[13:08:03] <superaragornlego> what is it called? is it in the JqueryUI?
[13:09:39] <DannyZB> looks like an accordion
[13:09:50] <DannyZB> you need an accordion for each menu in that case though *
[13:10:12] <DannyZB> nope .. I'm outdated lol
[13:10:25] <DannyZB> it's just an accordion with "collapsible" set to true : http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#option-collapsible
[13:16:57] <MysterOnyx> I have a strange problem. Certain alerted information is working, and certain information is not. Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/HV5fx/
[13:17:56] <MysterOnyx> the alert within the for loop works, but after ajax, the same alert does not work. Yet, the .hey property alerts fine...
[13:20:34] <warrenparsons> MysterOnyx: This is unreliable since you're executing functions without making sure the AJAX call has completed first.
[13:20:55] <MysterOnyx> it's synchronous though
[13:21:26] <raj> MysterOnyx, does it work with console.log()?
[13:22:03] <rotham> hey.. any ideas why .submit wouldnt be triggered when I submit a form by hitting enter rather than hitting the submit button?
[13:22:17] <MysterOnyx> raj I haven't used console.log before (somewhat new to this)
[13:22:29] <raj> oh, sorry
[13:22:32] <raj> i see your first one worked
[13:22:36] <raj> then that's not the issue
[13:22:41] <justinhjohnson> MysterOnyx: use custom events like i mentioned yesterday
[13:22:47] <raj> but, for future reference...when testing, use console.log() instead of alert()
[13:22:58] <raj> and press f12 in your browser to view your console output
[13:23:06] <MysterOnyx> oh ok raj, that'll be more useful
[13:23:10] <raj> (there'll be a console tab)
[13:23:16] <raj> much much more useful
[13:23:19] <raj> a lot more informative output
[13:23:24] <MysterOnyx> justinhjohnson I was going to, but I was thinking that would be more difficult than this method
[13:23:36] <raj> instead of saying [Object object] or some crap in alert(), it'll show you the actual object contents in console.log()
[13:23:54] <justinhjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/D3trW/2/
[13:24:07] <justinhjohnson> MysterOnyx: your way is completely unreliable because of the async nature of your code
[13:24:09] <saml> hey, is it possible to make crossdomain GET request that returns html, not json?  I can't use <iframe>  or <form>. I need to stay on the page.
[13:24:31] <MysterOnyx> justinhjohnson even though it's set to synchronous?
[13:24:37] <saml> should the server encode html as {"html": encodedhtml}  ?
[13:24:48] <MysterOnyx> raj that's great, glad you told me
[13:25:01] <shoky> any idea why www.html5rocks.com  is so slow and heavy on chrome ?
[13:25:32] <justinhjohnson> MysterOnyx: i wouldn't recommend async: false; "Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active."
[13:25:37] <justinhjohnson> MysterOnyx: terrible for your users
[13:25:43] <raj> hey shoky
[13:25:56] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: also, aren't you redefining/emptying the object weight[data[y].id] with each loop iteration?
[13:26:02] <MysterOnyx> justinhjohnson I guess, but I'm the only person who'll be using this site, so I figured it wouldn't slow it down too much
[13:26:26] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: ahh nm
[13:26:28] <justinhjohnson> MysterOnyx: pub/sub is extremely powerful and will help you further decouple your applications. it's a good thing to learn. if you've ever done MVC it'll feel natural after a while.
[13:26:34] <raj> justinhjohnson, why not just put a function in there
[13:26:42] <raj> I mean a function call
[13:26:45] <justinhjohnson> because then your function isn't reusable
[13:26:49] <raj> instead of the $(window).trigger()
[13:26:53] <justinhjohnson> what if you want 3 functions to respond to the event
[13:26:59] <raj> the function should be outside the $.ajax()
[13:27:01] <justinhjohnson> then you start stacking more code INSIDE of an ajax call
[13:27:06] <raj> it'll be hoisted and available
[13:27:31] <justinhjohnson> okay, even then, you'll still be explicitly referencing methods from within your application. if your methd names changes, you have to do a search and replace
[13:27:38] <justinhjohnson> pub/sub is better imho
[13:27:57] <MysterOnyx> I'm just surprised that some of the object's properties are being populated and some are not... I thought turning off async meant nothing happens until the ajax has completed
[13:27:57] <raj> well, that's just a matter of organization
[13:28:22] <raj> if those three functions are always called together, they can each be called inside 1 function, which is the 1 function you call at the end of $.ajax()
[13:28:24] <Jon47> MysterOnyx: never turn off async!  there's a better way, whatever you're thinking of, there's a better way
[13:28:32] <justinhjohnson> raj: sure, but when you work with 90 developers you have to enforce organization
[13:28:34] <raj> but, that's just nitpicky anyway
[13:28:53] <raj> understood
[13:28:57] <raj> it's my personal preference
[13:29:03] <raj> and since I'm a lone ranger...
[13:29:04] <shoky> hey raj ;)
[13:29:05] <raj> :)
[13:29:24] <justinhjohnson> raj: i guess it's my Flash MVC experience that influences my POV
[13:29:33] <justinhjohnson> i prefer that my classes/methods subscribe to events
[13:29:43] <MysterOnyx> Jon47 I totally believe there's a better way, but unfortunately the guy I'm making this for is getting pissed off and wants this done asap.. I'm just trying to get this working as quickly as possible, and then I can go back later to optimize it
[13:29:45] <justinhjohnson> and that those events are broadcast and can send payloads of data through
[13:30:05] <justinhjohnson> that way i can completely rename methods, namespaces, etc an not have to change nearly as much code
[13:30:12] <justinhjohnson> as long as the event names are in tact
[13:31:21] <MysterOnyx> I guess I don't logically understand why some of the object's properties are being populated and some are not
[13:31:44] <MysterOnyx> is it just the nature of what I'm doing?
[13:32:13] <justinhjohnson> i'll look again, one sec
[13:33:55] <justinhjohnson> MysterOnyx: honestly, it looks like it should work as long as y == 1
[13:34:04] <MysterOnyx> yeah, very strange
[13:34:24] <justinhjohnson> when you say 'doesn't work', what do you mean
[13:34:38] <justinhjohnson> if you were to log weight[1004].gram_weight[1], what would be the output? undefined?
[13:34:59] <MysterOnyx> yeah it comes back as undefined, however if I log weight[1004].gram_weight it comes back as [object Object]
[13:35:17] <MysterOnyx> actually I'll change the alerts to console.log and see what happens
[13:36:57] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx:
[13:37:42] <NoiseEee> Â weight[data[y].id].gram_weightÂ =Â {};   weight[data[y].id].gram_weight[y]Â =Â data[y].gram_weight;   <--- in a loop.    weight[data[y].id].gram_weight[1] disappears when y becomes 2 / next iteration ?
[13:38:00] <JCBK> i'm making a syntax error and I'm honestly too tired to see itâ¦anyone? $(document).ready(function(){
[13:38:01] <JCBK> $('#hidecode').click(function () {
[13:38:01] <JCBK> Â  Â  Â  Â Â $(this).children.toggleClass("ticked");
[13:38:01] <JCBK> Â  Â  Â  Â  $.('.code').fadeToggle("fast");
[13:38:01] <JCBK> });
[13:38:33] <Jon47> Â  Â  Â  Â  $.('.code')
[13:38:39] <Jon47> remove the first period dude
[13:39:10] <MysterOnyx> NoiseEee, are you asking if that's what happens?
[13:39:30] <JCBK> cheers jon47â¦still doesn't work though
[13:39:41] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: it is what is happening
[13:39:50] <MysterOnyx> NoiseEee you're right... just checked it
[13:39:51] <NoiseEee> you're resetting the object
[13:40:21] <MysterOnyx> *sigh* thank you NoiseEee
[13:40:29] <NoiseEee> np
[13:40:45] <MysterOnyx> seems so obvious now lol
[13:44:22] <raj> how do I give all javascript my own custom hour glass?
[13:44:46] <JCBK> what's wrong here? jslint says my js is valid http://jsfiddle.net/v7VTb/
[13:47:38] <raj> or perhaps for ajax
[13:48:31] <warrenparsons> JCBK: You're missing parentheses on .children()
[13:52:47] <slide23> Is there a way to limit the ui selectable component to vertical selections in a table?
[13:52:51] <JCBK> warrenparsons: I see, that fixed one issue :). but it still doesnt toggle the other part (.code)
[13:52:51] <slide23> i tried using $('#schedule').selectable({ filter: 'td:nth-child(1)' }); and increment that for each column, but only the last column really works
[13:53:12] <warrenparsons> JCBK: You should probably do that as a separate action rather than chaining it.
[13:53:35] <JCBK> warrenparsons: how?
[13:54:13] <warrenparsons> JCBK: http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/v7VTb/1/
[13:54:41] <JCBK> @warrenparsons: cheers :)
[13:54:44] <bot-t> much like multi-level marketing
[13:55:12] <JCBK> so it was just the semi colon
[13:55:34] <culh> how can I force the screen to page down upon an event?
[13:55:41] <warrenparsons> JCBK: No. A semicolon and not attaching it with a period to the previous string.
[13:55:58] <gnarf> thanks bot-t
[13:56:00] <bot-t> gnarf, I'm a bot you know..
[13:56:01] <JCBK> warrenparsons: yeah sorry, thats what i meant. a semi colon instead of a period

[14:07:52] <ML74> Could someone give me a hand with a speed issue? I'm not sure what the problem is, but there seems to be something slowing the scripts down.
[14:08:14] <DannyZB> ML74: thumbs up for being oh-so-specific
[14:08:20] <DannyZB> jsfiddle a problematic script
[14:08:54] <DannyZB> btw - google chrome / firebug have built-in speed measurements
[14:09:34] <axl_> jrockjiggz: it is a select input
[14:09:43] <ML74> could you have a look at the page?
[14:10:46] <DannyZB> ML74: stop beating around the bush
[14:11:07] <DannyZB> jsfiddle.net put the slow code there and give us a link
[14:11:49] <ML74> what do i do about the extra scripts?
[14:12:26] <DannyZB> ML74: you have a menu on the left " additional resources " add the scripts there
[14:12:33] <DannyZB> *Add Resources
[14:12:34] <ML74> oh, ok
[14:13:17] <DannyZB> Ladies and Gentlemen .. without further adeu .. I give you the international unveiling of the first desing of jDiskOnline :P http://www.online-vault.net/jdiskonline/example.html
[14:13:56] <DannyZB> PHP code opensourcing : DONE ... jQuery update to latest version DONE .. connection of GUI to PHP 60% done coming in several days
[14:14:13] <ML74> what about images? :/
[14:14:37] <DannyZB> what about them ??? you can just link to the full URL of the images
[14:15:02] <DannyZB> if it's a full webpage just give us the URL
[14:16:37] <jrockjiggz> axl_: try this http://jsfiddle.net/MjNqH/1/
[14:17:55] <jrockjiggz> axl_: fixed http://jsfiddle.net/MjNqH/2/
[14:18:07] <axl_> hey, thanks!
[14:18:12] <axl_> i am taking a look
[14:18:46] <axl_> wondering if i am having problems because i am chaining a different input type
[14:18:48] <axl_> err..
[14:18:53] <JCBK> i've got a jquery plugin which doesnt seem to work on iPhoneâ¦how would I go about debugging this?
[14:18:54] <axl_> a different input element
[14:19:05] <axl_> but let me go try something like you have done
[14:19:26] <ML74> DannyZB: I think this is itâ¦ http://jsfiddle.net/7TFYD/1/
[14:19:30] <DannyZB> btw alx_ do you want to get the dropdown back afterwards ?
[14:20:12] <DannyZB> woah love the design
[14:21:57] <jrockjiggz> axl_: your code looks like it should work, my post was to prove it works
[14:22:01] <DannyZB> is the while rectangle a scrollbar ?
[14:22:11] <DannyZB> white *
[14:22:25] <axl_> jrockjiggz: so, do you think there  might be something else that might be coming in the way that avoids its working?
[14:22:32] <axl_> i checked that jqeury is loaded
[14:22:32] <axl_>  
[14:22:33] <axl_> thin
[14:22:33] <ML74> yeah. it works on webpage, but not here for some reason
[14:22:34] <axl_> k
[14:23:46] <ML74> DannyZB: have a look here: http://designbyml.com/washington/
[14:23:55] <ML74> you'll see what i mean by running slowly
[14:24:38] <DannyZB> you did all that stuff ?
[14:26:28] <DannyZB> what was that for ?
[14:26:33] <DannyZB> Rotating background     jQuery(function(){
[14:26:49] <DannyZB> why did you write that like a plug-in ? any namespace collisions ?
[14:27:35] <ML74> yes
[14:27:51] <ML74> i'm not sure :/
[14:28:01] <brrc> anyone has some spare minutes to help me with something ?
[14:28:19] <ML74> i used a plugin i already had for it
[14:28:32] <ML74> it was all running fine until i used it
[14:28:47] <ML74> yet it doesn't seem to cause a problem any other time.
[14:29:00] <shoky> that rising menu is annoying ;p
[14:29:09] <DannyZB> all was running fine until what ?
[14:29:19] <DannyZB> and I'm with shoky it's kinda over-kill with the moving menu
[14:29:20] <shoky> brrc: ask
[14:29:42] <shoky> not overkill it's just not too usable.. i go click on something and the link moves up
[14:30:12] <shoky> don't really notice any slowness..
[14:30:14] <brrc> shoky: its about the jquery.nivo.slider, i can't see it get it to slide properlly just between my set of images it seems like it adds empty images or does a bigger loop because it seems to show transparent or unexistign images.
[14:30:28] <shoky> ?demo @ brrc
[14:30:29] <bot-t> brrc, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:30:56] <ML74> see, i'm just recreating http://www.washingtonbelfast.com/ and have been told to make everything function exactly the same
[14:31:40] <shoky> their menu is even more annoying :)
[14:31:58] <umren> ML74 with music?
[14:32:05] <DannyZB> I'm not sure it's a bug
[14:32:16] <DannyZB> the gigantic image transition is pretty computation-heavy
[14:32:25] <ML74> umren: music will probably be disappearing
[14:32:27] <DannyZB> you said you did something when everything slowed down
[14:32:37] <ML74> yeah, when i added the rotating images
[14:32:37] <DannyZB> what did you do that f*ed everything up ?
[14:32:48] <DannyZB> oh
[14:32:49] <ML74> but is there a way to do it without slowing the whole thing down?
[14:32:49] <umren> ML74 good, i hate autoplaying music on sites ;)
[14:32:58] <DannyZB> hmm
[14:33:00] <ML74> can't be flash - needs to be iOS compatible
[14:33:18] <ML74> would html5 video maybe be an option? :/
[14:33:34] <DannyZB> that would rule out tons of browsers
[14:33:41] <DannyZB> and I'm not sure you can use that for a background
[14:33:45] <shoky> what's slow there?
[14:34:00] <DannyZB> shoky : not everyone has a supercomputer like you do (:
[14:34:12] <shoky> that's why i'm asking
[14:34:15] <ML74> it's running slow when i try to scroll or move the navigation along. tested it on another few machines too and it does the same
[14:34:27] <brrc> shoky: http://pastebin.com/jsYYTWaA
[14:34:41] <ML74> and the transitions aren't smooth
[14:34:42] <shoky> brrc right..
[14:34:48] <shoky> ?jsfiddle @ brrc
[14:34:48] <bot-t> brrc, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[14:34:57] <DannyZB> ML74: by disabling auto-resize the thing got a bit faster
[14:35:09] <DannyZB> maybe you can limit auto-resize to once every second or smth
[14:35:30] <ML74> i thought the auto resize was limited to only when the window was resized? :/
[14:36:33] <DannyZB> nope my mistake .. just my pc going nuts
[14:36:56] <DannyZB> you said everything slows down when you scroll down ?
[14:37:42] <DannyZB> some ideas to pick speed up :
[14:37:47] <ML74_> sorry, i meant using the scrollbar on the right
[14:37:54] <DannyZB> ML74
[14:38:03] <DannyZB> I see some things that may slow it down
[14:38:19] <DannyZB> 1.) you have 5 img elements on top of eachother
[14:39:06] <DannyZB> you can use 1 image file , and use the background-position css property ( put all the images in one file and choose the image according to the position )
[14:39:24] <DannyZB> 2.) to do that you need 2 divs instead of 5 img tags
[14:39:51] <DannyZB> 3.) Make sure it's exactly the right size and not behind other elements so rendering the scrolling doesn't render over it
[14:40:08] <DannyZB> ( maybe the browser has to re-render the entire area including the image because it's behind it )
[14:40:32] <DannyZB> basically you have 1 displayed div , and one div you're transitioning to
[14:40:44] <DannyZB> they both would have the same "background-image" property
[14:40:50] <ML74> yeah, but would the image not take 5 times as long to load?
[14:41:06] <DannyZB> you load 5 images at once
[14:41:14] <DannyZB> instead you would load one image 5 times bigger
[14:41:21] <DannyZB> it would load as fast AT WORST
[14:41:48] <DannyZB> + you would have 2 div elements instead of 5 img elements
[14:42:02] <ML74> hmmmm.. what would i need to change in the script then?
[14:42:07] <DannyZB> and the thing with no overlapping with the rest of the page can also help ( it would also make the element smaller which is good )
[14:42:17] <DannyZB> change ? it's kind of a rewrite
[14:42:21] <tlack> i wrote a jquery plugin to create a downloadable csv file from a given table.. anyone ever heard of anything similar? if not i will release it
[14:42:39] <ML74> actually, there's another problem
[14:43:04] <ML74> the image has to resize with the page
[14:43:11] <DannyZB> so what ?
[14:43:18] <DannyZB> oh ...
[14:43:25] <DannyZB> 1'll think of something
[14:44:21] <DannyZB> for now do the quickest optimization : make the image -not- overlap with the right menu
[14:44:27] <DannyZB> limit it's width
[14:45:12] <ML74> my head's been in meltdown all day lol
[14:45:12] <ML74> also gotta figure out how to refresh only the top of the page when the nav is clicked for a page (using wordpress)
[14:46:54] <DannyZB> ok the backgrounds-trick thing is out no way to stretch it
[14:47:07] <sphinxxx> tlack: how do you force a download with javascript?
[14:47:33] <tlack> sphinxxx:               var data_url = 'data:text/csv;charset=utf8,' + rows.join("%0D%0A");
[14:47:38] <tlack> then window.location = data_url
[14:48:03] <sphinxxx> interesting
[14:48:09] <sphinxxx> i have that functionality on a site I'm building
[14:48:12] <sphinxxx> but i'm using php
[14:48:17] <totimkopf> hey guys, how do I set global variables from within an ajax handler?
[14:48:32] <tlack> totimkopf: just manipulate the variable without 'var' in front
[14:48:48] <sphinxxx> totimkopf: first declare it in a global scope
[14:49:03] <sphinxxx> as high level as you want
[14:50:22] <ML74> DannyZB: http://www.ajaxblender.com/bgstretcher-2-jquery-stretch-background-plugin-updated.html Could this work?
[14:51:09] <DannyZB> ML74: I dunno try it
[14:51:24] <DannyZB> and great idea there a bunch of slideshow jQuery plug-ins out there
[14:51:34] <DannyZB> I'm sure some of them are fast enough
[14:51:41] <DannyZB> and if not .. well .. you gave it a try lol
[14:51:57] <totimkopf> strange, I guess that worked, however, when I alert the variable outside of the handler it seems not have have changed it
[14:52:37] <shoky> you probably alerted it before the handler was called
[14:53:24] <DannyZB> ML74 : I just looked at the demo ... they're doing exactly what you did
[14:53:25] <totimkopf> shoky, no, it's after
[14:53:36] <ML74> DannyZB: Oh shit lol
[14:53:51] <ML74> i've seen this done before though and it worked :/ can't remember where though
[14:54:39] <totimkopf> shoky, http://pastebin.com/EzcZ25BJ
[14:54:44] <totimkopf> take a gander please
[14:54:52] <totimkopf> it's not much code :)
[14:55:30] <shoky> i dont see any alert
[14:56:13] <totimkopf> oops
[14:56:19] <totimkopf> i deleted it at the last minute, sorry
[14:56:27] <totimkopf> i had it right before the if(count > 0)
[14:56:31] <totimkopf> alert(count);
[14:56:44] <shoky> yes
[14:56:48] <totimkopf> sec let me update
[14:56:48] <shoky> so , what i said before.
[14:57:10] <shoky> ?async
[14:57:11] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the userâs ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[14:57:13] <shoky> er.
[14:57:46] <MrPunkin> is there an easy way to infer the id of the element from a link who's href is an on-page target
[14:57:50] <jrockjiggz> wow u got told
[14:58:03] <shoky> huha
[14:58:07] <jrockjiggz> lol
[14:58:08] <totimkopf> shoky, it's set to false?
[14:58:09] <totimkopf> :S
[14:58:24] <shoky> totimkopf what is?
[14:58:49] <totimkopf> shoky,  was that ?async for me
[14:58:58] <shoky> yea but disregard it
[14:58:59] <shoky> ;)
[14:59:01] <totimkopf> ah ok
[14:59:26] <shoky> anyway, the $.get call is non-blocking
[14:59:31] <jrockjiggz> MrPunkin: if i understand, you can var id = $("a[href*='#hash']").attr('id')
[14:59:45] <shoky> the code right after it gets called before the response callback is run

[15:00:10] <ML74> DannyZB: So what do you think my best plan of attack is?
[15:00:22] <DannyZB> I'm not sure there is one
[15:00:38] <DannyZB> it's one of those cases you bang your head against the wall until gold comes out of it
[15:01:00] <DannyZB> Maybe you can convince the client a slide-in is a better effect lol
[15:01:21] <ML74> hmmm lol
[15:01:31] <totimkopf> shoky, oh i see
[15:01:54] <totimkopf> shoky, well, the count is still getting checked
[15:01:58] <dsevans93> Is this an appropriate place to ask about the behavior of the .toggle(handler, handler) event?
[15:02:01] <DannyZB> ML74:http://radikalfx.com/files/anibg/
[15:02:06] <totimkopf> otherwise those lists wouldn't show up as error messages
[15:02:10] <DannyZB> Maybe an HTML5 canvas is the answer
[15:02:14] <totimkopf> so, i guess that's all that matters :)
[15:02:24] <DannyZB> and slide-ins on browsers too old to support it
[15:03:06] <ML74> yeah. iOS is html5 compatible too, right?
[15:03:22] <shoky> do the hidden <img>'s have display:none ?
[15:03:27] <DannyZB> This barely runs on a PC
[15:03:39] <DannyZB> I would hold my fingers crossed about the performance thing
[15:03:53] <DannyZB> try what shoky said but it would surprise me if the browsers don't already do that
[15:04:02] <shoky> yea me too but who knows.

[15:06:15] <maximus_> Hey all. I just started with JQuery, is there any way to declare functions that I could put in an objects onChange attribute?
[15:06:30] <shoky> sure
[15:06:40] <shoky> but better to not use the attribute
[15:06:47] <shoky> and bind the event in js
[15:06:50] <maximus_> How would I use the attribute?
[15:06:57] <shoky> what do you mean?
[15:07:02] <tlack> here's my table -> csv download library if anyone cares https://bitbucket.org/tlack/jquery.csv_download/overview
[15:07:31] <shoky> tlack it looks yummy, the community thanks you

[15:08:23] <dsevans93> I've got a .toggle(handler, handler) event assigned to a hyperlink tag. It show/hides three different elements. One of those elements contains a Cancel button that should also hide the three elements. If I open the div with the toggle event, then close it with the Cancel button, the toggle doesn't realize (of course) that its been "toggled" and so when clicked again, it doesn't show. Is there a way to "fire" the toggle event, or to ma
[15:08:27] <shoky> maximus just declare the function.. in the <head> part
[15:08:35] <ML74> DannyZB: That's just changing opacity on hover?
[15:08:42] <DannyZB> nope
[15:08:46] <DannyZB> look at the CSS
[15:08:53] <DannyZB> better yet , I found the property for you
[15:09:00] <maximus_> shoky: All I know is how to declare $(selector).action(function(...){...
[15:09:09] <DannyZB> (not supported in explorer , so explorer users would have to get used to slow jQuery performance (: )
[15:09:11] <DannyZB> http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_transitions.asp
[15:09:13] <maximus_> shoky: I'm really new to this, so I'm shaky.
[15:09:27] <shoky> maximus hang on..
[15:09:42] <ML74> dannyzb: so how to make it run automatically. and be able to change when page changes?
[15:09:57] <DannyZB> it IS automatic
[15:10:20] <maximus_> shoky: Holding on.
[15:10:24] <DannyZB> what it does is : when you change the element's background CSS property , it takes  ( x ) seconds to transition instead of immediately
[15:11:12] <JCBK> when an element moves because another element is hidden, can I tie an animation to that?
[15:11:28] <ML74> yeah, but how do you make it do this with pure css without a hover
[15:11:36] <DannyZB> ...
[15:11:41] <DannyZB> CSS3 + jQuery
[15:11:50] <DannyZB> you set "transition : 5s" in CSS3
[15:11:57] <adac> how to grow a text area  when text gets to long?
[15:12:06] <DannyZB> then you just call a background-image change every 5 seconds
[15:12:18] <DannyZB> \and it would transition itself (:

[15:14:48] <DannyZB> can't  promise but stop beating around the bush and try it
[15:14:56] <shoky> DannyZB just being nitty, but- plz dont link to w3schools.com

[15:27:40] <wuwoot> but i want that to be replaced with something from canada
[15:27:45] <wuwoot> when somebody hits canada
[15:27:56] <wuwoot> but if you hit canada after you hit us, it stacks
[15:28:14] <wuwoot> probably flubbed it quite some bit
[15:28:37] <DannyZB> personally , I rarely use JS for menus
[15:28:42] <DannyZB> Pure CSS3 is cleaner
[15:29:02] <DannyZB> and besides , a proper menu is done with lists , not div's
[15:29:23] <wuwoot> yea, i know
[15:29:28] <wuwoot> except i need to have that menu
[15:29:32] <wuwoot> fill one div with the proper data
[15:29:45] <DannyZB> you can fill a list in the same way .. whats the issue ?
[15:29:51] <DannyZB> I just find the markup hard to follow
[15:29:52] <wuwoot> yea, i guess
[15:30:02] <DannyZB> http://purecssmenu.com/
[15:30:12] <DannyZB> I always use that website to construct menus
[15:30:22] <DannyZB> you can use javascript to fill it out afterwards no-problem
[15:30:34] <wuwoot> awesome
[15:30:55] <DannyZB> + if you want a transition effect ( all browsers except explorer ) there are CSS properties for that
[15:33:20] <DannyZB> wuwoot ... fukin website blocked saving lol
[15:33:26] <DannyZB> one sec I'll find another one
[15:33:58] <wuwoot> DannyZB: except this is a hover menu when i want it to be clickable
[15:34:07] <wuwoot> or to dropdown only when it's clickable
[15:34:21] <DannyZB> you can't make a clickable menu with jQuery
[15:34:25] <DannyZB> * with CSS
[15:34:54] <DannyZB> one sec I'll look at your code
[15:35:42] <SuperPhly> I'm kinda new to jQuery and I'm having some issues with a page working in Chrome but not FireFox. Would anyone mind taking a look?
[15:36:10] <shoky> no
[15:37:03] <quuxman> anybody know of an rich text editor that limits the kind of HTML you can paste in?
[15:37:23] <SuperPhly> shoky: thanks, http://deepa.codymarxbailey.com/
[15:39:07] <wuwoot> DannyZB: having it clickable is the primary reason i'm using jquery. it's really not a menu. what i'm actually designing is a small thing that shows available territories depending on the location that somebody clicks on. so a client from the US will only see US states and provinces and somebody from Canada those states and provinces.
[15:39:41] <DannyZB> wuwoot : Like an accordion ?
[15:40:00] <wuwoot> DannyZB: possibly? lol.
[15:40:19] <wuwoot> DannyZB: i guess that's why i didn't use lists
[15:40:29] <DannyZB> ? accordion
[15:40:30] <bot-t> DannyZB, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[15:40:36] <wuwoot> DannyZB: because it's really not a menu.
[15:41:43] <wuwoot> DannyZB: accordion would show too many stacked items, no?
[15:42:03] <DannyZB> it would show exactly as many items as you would tell it to
[15:42:40] <DannyZB> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[15:44:07] <wuwoot> DannyZB: lemme give that a go. i'm guessing that I can put a "state" accordion inside a "country" accordion...
[15:45:49] <DannyZB> It's not settling .. it's much better than what you have time to build yourself
[15:46:08] <DannyZB> btw wuwoot : http://jsfiddle.net/5wZEW/
[15:46:22] <DannyZB> http://jsfiddle.net/5wZEW/1/ *
[15:47:52] <wuwoot> DannyZB: thanks for the help, except if a menu is already shown, then clicking on another option doesn't hide the previous menu
[15:48:07] <catcher> DannyZB, your code is inaccurate, family guy takes place in the US.
[15:48:28] <DannyZB> File a bug report then I'll see what I can do (:
[15:48:42] <catcher> haha
[15:49:10] <DannyZB> wuwoot : thats easy to fix ... just hide the other one when you show the current one ( make a common class for all menus and exclude the current item from hiding )
[15:49:51] <DannyZB> $(".menus-class").not("ul",this).slideToggle(500,false);
[15:51:21] <wuwoot> DannyZB: cool. got it.

[16:06:43] <Jarred_Keeper> Question... can  you have a jquery popup from within a jquery popup?
[16:14:53] <Jarred_Keeper> anyone alive here?
[16:15:28] <Jarred_Keeper> just wondering if anyone has ever heard of or seen a jquery pop within a jquery popup
[16:16:25] <bobbytek2> poo
[16:16:31] <Jarred_Keeper> i agree
[16:17:27] <Jarred_Keeper> deirnit
[16:17:27] <shoky> poo
[16:17:33] <ZeuZ> $(document).on("click",'[name="retry"]',location.reload(true)); -> Why does that cause an infinite loop of refreshes when the button is not even on dom yet?
[16:17:51] <Jarred_Keeper> i wouldn'/t have thought they'd still have those
[16:17:56] <shoky> zuez hah
[16:18:16] <shoky> try: $(document).on("click",'[name="retry"]', function() { location.reloat(true); });
[16:18:21] <shoky> ZeuZ i mean.
[16:18:30] <shoky> and reload, even
[16:18:42] <Jarred_Keeper> like another drink shoky?
[16:18:47] <ZeuZ> shoky, wouldn't it be the same? trying it anyways, thanks
[16:18:48] <shoky> ;D
[16:18:56] <shoky> ZeuZ no it wouldn't
[16:19:04] <shoky> the way you wrote it, reload() gets called right away
[16:19:19] <Jarred_Keeper> shoky, have you seen a jquery popup from within a jquery popup?
[16:19:29] <shoky> der.. guess not?
[16:19:37] <shoky> not even sure what a jquery popup is
[16:19:45] <Jarred_Keeper> just a popup..
[16:20:11] <bobbytek2> poo
[16:20:26] <Jarred_Keeper> comes up with page.. but i need another popup.. rather i would like anothe pop...
[16:20:31] <ZeuZ> shoky, doing that somehow kills another bind I have with the same button class (different name though)
[16:20:54] <Jarred_Keeper> i guess... as a work around.. i can have the link go to another page THEN have it auto popup there..
[16:20:58] <ZeuZ> http://pastebin.com/pFRGpVk3
[16:21:00] <shoky> ZeuZ it should definitely not be the way you originally wrote it
[16:21:01] <bobbytek2> I miss paulirish

[16:21:15] <shoky> he's right here
[16:21:20] <shoky> oh
[16:21:22] <ZeuZ> shoky, agreed, although I can't figure it out

[16:22:28] <shoky> not sure what your intention is there
[16:22:43] <ZeuZ> the first part was working fine
[16:22:45] <shoky> do you want to reload the page or do you want to send an ajax request?
[16:22:53] <shoky> you cant to both i think...
[16:22:54] <shoky> do
[16:23:08] <ZeuZ> the first button (name='iniciar') sends the ajax request
[16:23:19] <ZeuZ> the second button (name='intentar') reloads
[16:23:32] <shoky> oh didn't notice they're different ids :)
[16:23:34] <ZeuZ> sorry, I was used to the .live() method and it's marked as deprecated
[16:23:45] <shoky> differnet names, that is
[16:24:02] <shoky> hmm i don't see why it shouldn't work
[16:25:00] <ZeuZ> it somehow unbinds the previous button's function on-click
[16:25:14] <shoky> hmm
[16:25:31] <shoky> i'll fiddle smth up

[16:40:45] <avdeveloper> I have this form on the client side of my application that I want to POST to a server that uploads the image specified on the form: https://gist.github.com/2381009
[16:41:23] <avdeveloper> When I click "Save Changes" I see that the posts.json request is a "GET" request when it should be POST
[16:41:47] <avdeveloper> since the server is using REST, it returns an index of posts as opposed to going to POST posts which creates a post
[16:42:00] <avdeveloper> you can see that I
[16:42:05] <avdeveloper> 'm using jQuery Form plugin
[16:42:25] <avdeveloper> and have specified extra attributes in the options to make sure it can do cross-domain requests

[17:25:25] <dekhaus> Hi.  I'd like to know how to update a 'draggable' item with content from a 'droppable' item.  For example imagine dragging a icon on top of a set of table td's (each containing a string) and having the 'helper' text of the draggable icon be updated with the text from the current td that its being dragged over.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thx
[17:28:29] <bobbytek2> ? exec eval(  'eval(  \'eval(\'for(;;){}\')\' )'  )
[17:30:02] <X-tonic> I am looping each element of a class by $('.foo').each(). Is it possible to get the ID of this elements? something like $(this).id ?
[17:31:14] <bot-t> bobbytek2: SyntaxError: missing variable name
[17:31:20] <bobbytek2> ? exec eval(  'eval(  \'eval(\'for(;;){alert(1)}\')\' )'  )
[17:31:22] <bobbytek2> stupid bot-t
[17:31:25] <bot-t> bobbytek2: SyntaxError: missing variable name
[17:31:35] <bobbytek2> I need my script to run bot-t
[17:31:37] <bobbytek2> Why can't you oblige?
[17:31:39] <bobbytek2> say what?
[17:31:52] <X-tonic> dekhaus: something like http://www.jeasyui.com/tutorial/dd/dnd3_demo.html ?
[17:32:24] <jrtr> X-tonic: http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[17:33:44] <X-tonic> jrtr: This would return an array if an element has multiple ids, right?
[17:34:00] <shoky> multiple ids?
[17:34:15] <X-tonic> id="foo bar"
[17:34:55] <shoky> $('<div id="foo bar" />').attr('id')
[17:34:55] <shoky> "foo bar"
[17:35:06] <shoky> that's one id with a space in it, i believe
[17:35:13] <shoky> hmm
[17:36:59] <jrtr> X-tonic: id="foo bar" is considered 1 id
[17:39:00] <X-tonic> ohk.. Then I should use class for what I need.
[17:39:01] <shoky> technically spaces aren't allowed in ids
[17:39:02] <X-tonic> Thanks
[17:39:29] <shoky> yes, multiple ids sounds like a bad idea in any form
[17:39:55] <X-tonic> and .attr('class') should work right?
[17:40:13] <shoky> it'll give you a string
[17:40:27] <X-tonic> and what if its multiple classes?
[17:40:36] <shoky> still, a string
[17:40:48] <X-tonic> ohk. thanks. :)
[17:41:10] <shoky> you can .split(' ') it if you want
[17:43:36] <dekhaus> X-tonic :  Thanks for the response.   The functionality is close - what remains is updating the content of the draggable item with content from the droppable item that the draggable item is hovering over
[17:44:43] <dekhaus> For example - the time at which the class occurs (aka from 'School Timetable' demo in the link you sent above).
[17:44:58] <bobbytek2> ? exec "poo pee".split(' ')
[17:45:04] <bobbytek2> bot-t, hi
[17:45:26] <shoky> hi helo
[17:45:40] <shoky> exec "poo pee".split(' ')
[17:45:46] <shoky> eek
[17:46:38] <Bartzy> Hey
[17:46:57] <Bartzy> $('.some_class', $some_cached_jquery_object);
[17:47:11] <Bartzy> is that faster than $some_cached_jquery_object.find('.some_class') ?
[17:47:29] <shoky> it's the exact same thing i believe
[17:47:59] <shoky> from docs: Internally, selector context is implemented with the .find() method, so $('span', this) is equivalent to $(this).find('span').
[17:50:07] <bobbytek2> ? find
[17:50:20] <shoky> let him go man, let him go
[17:50:54] <bobbytek2> where'd he go man? where'd he go?
[17:51:25] <shoky> to the wild
[17:59:49] <X-tonic> How do i reference a parent div from a $(this) ?
[18:00:07] <shoky> $(this).parent('div')
[18:00:14] <shoky> or just $(this).parent()
[18:00:24] <X-tonic> ohk. thanks.
[18:09:22] <janthony> Is there a way to wrap everything inside the body with an element via jquery?
[18:09:54] <janthony> Kinda like .wrap()
[18:10:18] <janthony> Unless wrap is the answer, such as $("body *").wrap()
[18:10:56] <bobbytek2> janthony, what are you trying to do exactly?
[18:11:25] <bobbytek2> ChanServ, hi bud!
[18:11:53] <janthony> bobbytek2: want to create a wrap of all the contents in the body, then after that wrap is created append a new div with new contents. after that hide the first wrap and show the new contents, for a print function.
[18:12:50] <bobbytek2> janthony, every child of body? ie. all elements?
[18:13:15] <janthony> bobbytek2: Just want to create one big wrap, so I guess body * won't work
[18:14:39] <janthony> bobbytek2: I know i could store the contents of body to a var, then do body.html('<div id="my-wrap">' + bodyVar + '</div>'); but seeing if there was another way
[18:16:11] <bobbytek2> janthony, what about wrapInner?
[18:16:57] <bobbytek2> aerosmith for-never
[18:17:59] <janthony> bobbytek2: That was it. Thanks!
[18:18:47] <janthony> The next question is, is it possible to remove that wrap w/o removing the contents of what's inside that wrap?
[18:19:14] <shoky> unwrap?

[18:23:51] <bobbytek2> rest in pieces my friend
[18:24:07] <blendedbychris> westg: care to elaborate?
[18:24:18] <shoky> ML74 it's not "just switching"
[18:24:23] <shoky> it's doing some funky business
[18:24:44] <bobbytek2> "funky business" ?
[18:24:45] <shoky> with fading
[18:24:46] <ML74> well it is. it's changing the background of the div
[18:25:04] <shoky> i see fading, and resizing
[18:25:14] <ML74> what browser? :/
[18:25:20] <shoky> chrome
[18:25:56] <ML74> i'm using chrome (well rockmelt) and it's just changing the image with no fade :/
[18:26:18] <shoky> the images while fading are also getting narrower/wider.. i guess to fit in their container
[18:26:29] <phil-adept> ML74, there's a few things you need to look at. I suggest pre-loading the images before any transitions. Also on screens of 1400px+ wide, the bg image tends to be an image in the upper left hand corner
[18:26:52] <phil-adept> ml74, what are you trying to achieve?
[18:27:04] <shoky> on firefox the image disappears and a second later a new one appears
[18:27:15] <shoky> im on chrome dev build btw.
[18:28:03] <phil-adept> shoky, put your code in a jsfiddle for everyone and we'll get a better understanding of things. It might also higlight errors to yourself once you start stripping it back to basics
[18:28:06] <bobbytek2> peace out bot-t
[18:28:07] <bobbytek2> rest in pieces my friend
[18:28:17] <shoky> phil-adept, what?
[18:28:32] <phil-adept> jsfiddle, have you ever used it? It's great :)
[18:28:40] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/
[18:28:48] <shoky> sure i've used it. but i don't need help with anything..
[18:28:57] <shoky> thanks though.
[18:28:59] <phil-adept> your background issue?...
[18:29:02] <shoky> not mine ;)
[18:29:03] <ML74> phil-adept: i'm trying to have the image fill the screen and rotate.
[18:29:09] <phil-adept> or have I missunderstood?
[18:29:16] <ML74> hahaha. it's my issue ;)
[18:29:25] <phil-adept> lol... god damb JD...
[18:29:26] <phil-adept> dman*
[18:29:31] <shoky> and he's used jsfiddle too ;)
[18:29:35] <phil-adept> my bad shoky, sorry fella :)
[18:29:39] <shoky> np fella
[18:30:30] <blendedbychris> westg: I was reading that a good solution might be myLib = { home:  { init: function () {}, doThis: function () {} } }
[18:30:33] <bobbytek2> ? g jsfiddle
[18:30:34] <bot-t> bobbytek2, Create a new Fiddle - jsFiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/
[18:31:16] <bobbytek2> ? exec for( i = 1;1;i++){eval('eval("eval(       \'for( i = 1;1;i++){alert(2)}\'                          )" ) ' )}
[18:31:34] <bobbytek2> bot-t, stay thirsty my friend
[18:31:36] <bot-t> bobbytek2, Couldn't find "stay thirsty my friend" in jQuery Docs.
[18:31:40] <philipbjorge> Does anyone know it's possible to exit early out of a jQuery.map?
[18:32:09] <ML74> phil-adept: i can't use it correctly lol
[18:32:17] <ML74> i just need to know what the best way to do it is
[18:32:21] <ML74> then i can attempt it
[18:33:30] <shoky> philipbjorge have you tried returning false?
[18:33:50] <shoky> er
[18:34:01] <shoky> actually scratch that
[18:34:11] <shoky> was thinking of each()
[18:34:20] * phil-adept is back...
[18:34:35] <phil-adept> with more Jack Daniels...
[18:34:51] <ML74> ?
[18:34:53] <phil-adept> I'm really pi**ed off I'm working tonigh
[18:35:19] <philipbjorge> yeah I'm not sure its possible. I can't pull up any docs though documenting that this is normal map() functionality though. i might just skip each functions contents somehow.
[18:37:30] <shoky> or you could $.each and build the array yourself..
[18:38:00] <philipbjorge> would the performance be the same?
[18:41:48] <phil-adept> philipbjorge, I missed your initial question. What's your query?
[18:42:04] <shoky> map just runs a for loop and calls your callback
[18:42:07] <phil-adept> (I've recently been implimenting a few scripts using .map() )
[18:42:10] <philipbjorge> is their any way to exit early out of a jQuery.map
[18:42:22] <phil-adept> return false?
[18:42:31] <shoky> and pushes the return value to the result array
[18:42:31] <phil-adept> ?map
[18:42:32] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[18:42:44] <bobbytek3> ?exec 1
[18:43:00] <shoky> return false is wrong..
[18:43:20] <shoky> it'd put false in the returned array
[18:43:41] <phil-adept> shoky, you're right AFAIK
[18:43:46] <phil-adept> seems logical
[18:43:51] <shoky> i'm looking at the source code now
[18:44:00] <shoky> for ( ; i < length; i++ ) {
[18:44:04] <shoky> value = callback( elems[ i ], i, arg );
[18:44:07] <shoky> ret[ ret.length ] = value;
[18:44:15] * phil-adept appreciates shoky's dedication...
[18:44:16] <shoky> (i pasted highlights)
[18:44:27] <shoky> always good to look at the source
[18:45:05] <phil-adept> shoky, of course. Documentation 1st, source code if you're up to it
[18:45:25] <shoky> yuhp
[18:45:54] <phil-adept> philipbjorge, if you require to break out of the iteration the .each() may be your best option
[18:46:19] <shoky> or a for loop ;p
[18:46:35] <shoky> with a sweet old break;
[18:46:36] * phil-adept +1's shoky's answer
[18:46:45] <philipbjorge> Alright :D. I'll do that.
[18:46:49] <shoky> :DDD
[18:46:53] <phil-adept> native JS vs jquery functions... Native wins hands down
[18:47:01] <lenswipe> hey guys

[18:51:20] <lenswipe> phil-adept, i went to someone's house for a part and i was pouring my own drinks(we all know how that ends)
[18:51:33] <tw2113> it loads slow ML74
[18:51:40] <shoky> haha
[18:51:40] <ML74> i know
[18:51:55] <ML74> but what is causing the problem? the script or image size?
[18:52:05] <tw2113> no idea, i haven't seen any webpage yet
[18:52:10] <tw2113> it's stuck on "connecting"
[18:52:17] <phil-adept> lenswipe, Yip, I've been a passenger down that road a fair few times before!
[18:52:43] <lenswipe> phil-adept, they had a bar jigger for measuring i decided that measuring was for pussies and measured mine with a shot glass instead
[18:52:47] <ItsMeLenny> who was it that pointed me to (or who can help me) with a bit of JSON api thingy and blogger/blogspot
[18:52:49] <lenswipe> phil-adept, the resulst were predictable
[18:52:59] <jrockjiggz> Hi, I have a form that checked a field via ajax before submit.  I'm using async: false, to ensure the reply gets back in sequence.. but the delay is too much
[18:53:21] <phil-adept> lenswipe, you're a wreck then? lol
[18:53:32] <lenswipe> phil-adept, not right now, but i was fucked after that
[18:53:50] <lenswipe> phil-adept, it was a "lets get shitfaced before uni starts again" party

[18:57:15] <ML74> i'm not using it anymore
[18:57:19] <ML74> i'm back to just a rotator
[18:57:24] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/mkQv4/
[18:57:30] <ML74> trying to figure out if it's the image size that's screwing stuff up
[18:57:33] <lenswipe> anyone got any thoughts on why on() isnt firing?

[18:58:16] <shoky> lenswipe, events first, remembeR?
[18:58:28] <lenswipe> hmm?
[18:58:30] <shoky> hmm?
[18:58:32] <lenswipe> oh so click should be first?
[18:58:33] <lenswipe> ah
[18:58:47] <shoky> we went over this.. today i think
[18:58:59] <lenswipe> no it mustve been yesterday

[18:59:23] <poointheface> ? exec 'alert("hi")'
[18:59:29] <lenswipe> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/mkQv4/1/
[18:59:54] <lenswipe> so that works on jsfiddle, but not in my code for some reason(the tbody table rows are generated dynamically using jquery)
[19:00:42] <poointheface> ? eval 1
[19:01:05] <shoky> lenswipe you need to bind the event on something that isn't dynamically created
[19:01:11] <lenswipe> such as?
[19:01:17] <shoky> or
[19:01:30] <shoky> you're binding on 'tr'
[19:01:34] <lenswipe> correct
[19:01:40] <lenswipe> should i bind on tbody?
[19:01:47] <shoky> any tr you add to the document after binding it would not have the event binded to it..
[19:02:01] <shoky> i guess..
[19:02:22] <shoky> no reason to bind it to each tr
[19:02:23] <adept> ?on
[19:02:24] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[19:03:57] <shoky> ML74 it seems fine now
[19:04:19] <ML74> yeah
[19:04:25] <ML74> still a bit jittery. any idea why?
[19:04:46] <adept> I only 'thought' 2x arg's could be passed to .on()... You have 3... I doubt I'm right, so can anyone suggest why I am wrong?
[19:04:47] <shoky> hmm no jitterness here
[19:05:00] <shoky> adept, wat?
[19:05:20] <shoky> .on( events [, selector] [, data] , handler(eventObject) )
[19:05:31] <adept> lenswipe's jsfiddle... http://jsfiddle.net/mkQv4/1/
[19:05:41] <lenswipe> it works now i bound it to tbody :)
[19:05:47] <shoky> you just had bot-t link you to .on() docs
[19:05:59] <adept> he passes 3x args, I thought it only required / accepted 2?
[19:06:07] <shoky> why do you need to think about it
[19:06:16] <shoky> the docs specify everything
[19:06:17] <adept> well, 2 and a callback
[19:06:36] <shoky> adept, .on( events [, selector] [, data] , handler(eventObject) )
[19:06:49] <adept> shoky, maybe I've just had an epiphany and realised I've not completely understood the docs :)
[19:06:57] <shoky> ooooh
[19:07:25] <adept> ok, I'm not sure I see why my logic is wrong with that...
[19:07:34] <adept> Am I right in thinking this?...
[19:07:50] <adept> events [, selector] [, data] = arg1
[19:07:51] <shoky> that you've not completely understood the docs? yes
[19:07:55] <adept> handler(eventObject) = arg2?
[19:08:09] <shoky> yes that is wrong
[19:08:13] <shoky> events = arg1
[19:08:14] <adept> :(
[19:08:21] <shoky> selector = arg2 (optional)
[19:08:26] <shoky> data = arg3 (optional)
[19:08:30] * adept contemplates shooting himself
[19:08:32] <shoky> handler = arg4
[19:08:49] <shoky> please refrain
[19:08:58] <adept> shoky, so how do you specify an arg, if it's not required?...
[19:09:10] <shoky> just like lenswipe did
[19:09:16] <lenswipe> wut?
[19:09:17] <lenswipe> oh
[19:09:19] <lenswipe> sup :)
[19:09:30] <shoky> .on('click', '.someSelector', someHandler() { ........... });
[19:09:35] <shoky> sup.
[19:09:46] <adept> eg, I want to define arg 1 & 4, how does the function / method know that'y my intention without calling function( 'arg1', null, null, 'arg4' )
[19:10:06] <shoky> because it takes a look at the different arguments and it is smart like that
[19:10:24] <shoky> it checks the types of the arguments
[19:12:23] <adept> so [selector] has to be typeOf jQuery object, [data] has to be typeOf JS / JSON object and [handler] has to be typeOf object?
[19:12:45] <adept> if not then it 'assumes' that it was the next intended arg?
[19:13:49] <adept> ignore me... I've just read the line 'If the selector is null or omitted, the event is always triggered when it reaches the selected element' ...
[19:13:55] <adept> man I feel dumb
[19:15:17] <janthony> $(this).parents('form').find("input[type='checkbox']").attr('checked','checked'); - any idea why that breaks in IE9 but works in all other browsers including IE8 and IE7
[19:15:58] <shoky> adept look at the jquery code if you wanna see exactly whats happening there
[19:16:14] <ML74> how could i make a scroll box fill its parent div height wise? height:100% isn't working :/
[19:16:22] <adept> checked:true ?
[19:16:31] <shoky> janthony what about .prop('checked',true)
[19:16:45] <adept> shoky, I re-read the doc... Like I said I feel dumb for not 'seeing' that before
[19:17:02] <shoky> as long as you don't shoot yerself
[19:17:17] <adept> It's been a hard week...
[19:17:19] <shoky> being dumb is how you get smarter
[19:17:24] <adept> And I'm still working...
[19:17:43] <shoky> oh i've been on vacation all week
[19:17:47] <adept> I'm making silly mistakes at the moent I wouldn't normally... Over worked, under paid.. I'm fucked :(
[19:17:54] <shoky> company closed for holidays
[19:17:59] <adept> not what I needed to hear! lol
[19:18:03] <shoky> ;D
[19:18:08] <adept> :D
[19:18:14] * adept is happy for shoky
[19:18:20] <shoky> it's almost over tho ;(
[19:18:36] <shoky> week starts on sundauy
[19:19:41] <janthony> shoky: Hrm, that didn't work either: $(this).parents('form').find("input[type='checkbox']").prop('checked',true);
[19:19:57] <shoky> care to jsfiddle it ?
[19:20:09] <janthony> shoky: It's so werird. It only happens in IE9 and I am able to alert before and after that line.
[19:22:08] <adept> shoky, take a look at this. It was something I wrote a few weeks back, however in FF there's a flicker. Can you see what I've done wrong?...
[19:22:09] <adept> http://jsfiddle.net/PWjU9/4/
[19:24:22] <adept> I ended up changing my implimentation and using a <ul> with <li>'s positioned abolutely and changing the z-index and fading between each <li>. Only because this method didn't work correctly and I have no idea why?...
[19:24:23] <shoky> janthony, this works fine for me on IE9: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ALfCX/
[19:25:11] <adept> how does .prop() differ to .attr()?
[19:25:32] <adept> ignore me... 'The difference between attributes and properties can be important in specific situations. Before jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method sometimes took property values into account when retrieving some attributes, which could cause inconsistent behavior. As of jQuery 1.6, the .prop() method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while .attr() retrieves attributes.'
[19:25:34] <shoky> properties and attributes are different things
[19:25:59] <shoky> attributes are on html tags
[19:26:02] <adept> yip, just read that...
[19:26:03] <shoky> properties are on DOM elements
[19:26:18] <ML74> can someone help with retrieving a post from wordpress and refreshing part of the page using wordpress?
[19:26:33] <shoky> adept it's pretty flickery for me on chrome as well
[19:26:40] <adept> properties are DOM element properties and attr's are attr's for the html tag
[19:26:55] <shoky> yes
[19:27:41] <adept> shoky, really? I can't see why? I'm queing the animations / execution corectly however it has that flickering effect... All images are pre-loaded too... It stumped me and it bugs me that I changed my approach rather than figure out what the issue was..
[19:27:51] <adept> Chrome for me works perfect
[19:28:06] <shoky> it looks much better in firefox here ;)
[19:28:11] <hyperstream> hope this 'Bad Ass' movie is gewd.
[19:28:14] <shoky> just a tiny flicker like you said
[19:28:24] <shoky> in chrome it seems to be reloading the next image each time
[19:28:32] <adept> FF gave a much poorer experience here! Bizarre!
[19:29:08] <adept> If I put breakpoints in the execution it behaves perfectly. It's like it ignores the 'queue'...
[19:29:09] <shoky> and on IE9 it's perfect here
[19:31:03] <adept> FF 11.0 it flickers. Chrome 18.0.1025.152 m is perfect.
[19:32:12] <shoky> im on chrome 20.0.1096.1 dev-m
[19:32:21] <shoky> when the hell did it get to 20
[19:33:03] <adept> lol, god knows... FF has made me laugh with their update frequencies
[19:33:33] <adept> hang on... Chrome has aked me to restart due to an upgrade
[19:33:48] <adept> it's upgraded to 18.0.1025.162 m
[19:34:27] <adept> how did you get 20?
[19:34:44] <adept> v20 that is...
[19:35:27] <adept> http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.co.uk/
[19:35:36] <adept> u on the dev channel release?
[19:37:03] <shoky> yea
[19:37:28] <adept> is it worth changing mine?  What are the benefits / caveats?
[19:37:38] <adept> I typically dev in FF
[19:42:36] <moltar_net> Any good alternatives to jEditable that are actually maintained?
[19:42:50] <moltar_net> jE has 15 pull requests on GH and hasn't been updated for 3 years
[19:44:34] <shoky> adept nothing much, just seeing stuff that isn't in stable release yet
[19:44:37] <shoky> including bugs..
[19:44:41] <adept> moltar_net, if you're looking for < HTML5 compatible I have no idea. However HTML5+ = http://html5demos.com/contenteditable
[19:45:32] <moltar_net> adept: not exactly what I was looking for. don't need a full editor. just edit-in-place functionality
[19:45:51] <moltar_net> i.e. click a piece of text, it turns into an input, then save, and it sends ajax request to server
[19:45:55] <adept> shoky, have you found a way to explicitly define different Flash versions in Chrome. That's why I don't use it as much as I can do that in FF as well as using FlashBug to monitor requests etc.
[19:46:22] <adept> moltar_net, to be fair for something like that, I tend to write something custom
[19:47:03] <adept> I'm more a fan of DIY if you need basic functionality... Plugins if you need the extra stuff... But that's just me :D
[19:47:21] <airtonix> what wrong with jeditable?
[19:48:07] <moltar_net> airtonix: well for one, there is a pretty big, but easy to fix bug, that is already been fixed and is in pull request. it uses html() to read the data to be edited, which is wrong, and bugs out when you have escaped html characters in your text.
[19:48:29] <airtonix> wrong?
[19:48:30] <moltar_net> e.g. & -> it actually displays & in the text box to be edited
[19:48:47] <moltar_net> so lets say you had this & that.
[19:49:04] <moltar_net> then you want to 'edit' that. you get input box with "this & that" in it
[19:49:10] <moltar_net> dammit
[19:49:15] <moltar_net> irc escaping ;)
[19:49:17] <moltar_net> & amp;
[19:49:22] <moltar_net> "this & amp; that"
[19:49:43] <moltar_net> try it http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/default.html
[19:49:51] <moltar_net> enter value of "<<"
[19:49:53] <moltar_net> <
[19:49:58] <moltar_net> then try to edit it again
[19:50:17] <moltar_net> this looks nice however http://code.google.com/p/jquery-in-place-editor/
[19:52:41] <shoky> irc escaping?
[19:52:45] <shoky> this &amp; that
[19:53:43] <moltar_net> maybe just my client, I use pidgin
[19:54:03] <shoky> ya it's a client thing
[19:55:39] <shoky> i think irc predates html ;p
[19:55:59] <moltar_net> yeah but the server itself might do something funny :)
[19:56:03] <moltar_net> I know its not part of the protocol
[19:56:15] <moltar_net> maybe server is set to filter html who knows ;)
[19:56:27] <moltar_net> but yeah I am pretty sure it's the client, because it happened in skype too
[19:56:39] <moltar_net> pretty sure it didn't happen before, must be a recent bug
[19:56:52] <shoky> they prolly see it as a feature
[19:56:53] <moltar_net> going to join their channel and reprt
[19:56:58] <moltar_net> f that ;)
[19:57:04] <shoky> indeed
[19:57:56] <westg> css question guys
[19:57:58] <westg> https://gist.github.com/2381785
[19:58:09] <westg> need to horizontally center #menu within #container
[19:58:31] <westg> it's a horizontal menu of li's in a ul
[20:00:44] <shoky> margin: 0 auto  no good/
[20:00:44] <shoky> ?
[20:01:08] <westg> what do you mean?
[20:01:29] <westg> basically margin-left 60px doesn't work for me
[20:01:57] <westg> because if the first font I have in the font list isn't on the client's computer then the different font screws up the placement
[20:02:06] <westg> so I'm looking for a more robust solution
[20:02:11] <westg> and margin 0 auto doesn't work
[20:02:25] <westg> I think it's because I've floated all the li's to the left
[20:03:37] <adept> westg, do you have a jsfiddle? let us see your source / css
[20:05:56] <shoky> here's smth ;p http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cFaVc/
[20:06:01] <adept> if your ul is an inline element you should be able to center it using text-align, if it's a block element, margin: 0px auto as long as a width is defined and it has a parent element to 'margin' against. Vertical alignement's a little more complicated. Line-height = height of container works for text, however for block level elements I'm not to sure
[20:07:10] <adept> I've only ever used 'vertical-align' on images / table cells
[20:07:32] <adept> what are you you demonstrating thee shoky?
[20:07:55] <shoky> just put his stuff into a fiddle
[20:08:04] <shoky> well i changed the margin
[20:09:13] <adept> nothing is centered when I view your fiddle
[20:09:51] <shoky> i didn't say anything is centered in my fiddle
[20:10:00] <shoky> but sure it is ;p
[20:10:28] <adept> sorry fella, I thought your fiddle was a solution :D
[20:10:35] <shoky> container is centered and the menu is centered
[20:10:43] <adept> not here...
[20:11:46] <shoky> the gray dotted box isn't centered horizontally in the frame?
[20:11:59] <shoky> the blue box isn't centered horizontally inside the gray box?
[20:12:01] <adept> http://imgur.com/Pib4C
[20:12:22] <shoky> it's all centered, what's your problem ;p
[20:12:36] <adept> eh?! lol...
[20:12:42] <shoky> hm?
[20:12:45] <adept> nowt centered in that?...
[20:13:00] <shoky> the dotted box is centered in the frame...
[20:13:15] <shoky> the blue box takes the whole width of the dotted box
[20:13:19] <shoky> and so its centered
[20:13:25] <shoky> hm????
[20:13:38] <shoky> resize the frame
[20:14:30] <adept> christ, there was no difference in width! No wonder I couldn't spot it!!....
[20:14:33] <adept> http://jsfiddle.net/philwilliams81/cFaVc/1/
[20:14:38] <adept> I can now :)
[20:15:21] <shoky> see ;)
[20:15:32] <adept> that's the same as shoky's btw, only a lesser width for the menu so you can see the alignement
[20:15:42] <westg> I had this: http://jsfiddle.net/6ETr6/1
[20:15:53] <westg> what did you change shoky?
[20:15:54] <adept> shoky, now it's noticable!! I was looking at the render and couldn't see the wood for thtrees lol
[20:16:10] <shoky> adept then why say its not centered :P
[20:16:42] <shoky> westg i put margin: 0 auto  on the menu..
[20:19:53] <shoky> westg: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6ETr6/2/
[20:20:59] <adept> shoky, because i didn't frigging see it! lo
[20:20:59] <adept> lol
[20:21:10] <adept> we know this, I'm pissed!
[20:21:18] <shoky> well you were making claims about it!
[20:21:25] <shoky> other than 'i cant see it'
[20:22:01] <adept> lol... piss of :D

[20:43:35] <jrockjiggz> anyone know a way to return an error message back to ajax from php controller?
[20:44:26] <shoky> whatcha mean
[20:45:35] <jrockjiggz> in php, i would like to return a string or json.. ajax will receive a the error.. but because it's not really an error ajax sees' it as success
[20:45:54] <jrockjiggz> i was hoping to use ajaxError() or something along those lines
[20:46:00] <shoky> why?
[20:46:06] <shoky> the ajax request is successful, no?
[20:47:17] <jrockjiggz> well, i have a lightbox that closes on success.. but i want to not close if error
[20:47:44] <shoky> what does 'if error' mean
[20:48:25] <jrockjiggz> i submit form inside lightbox,  php will decide if it can proceed or not, if not, give error back to jquery and prevent success
[20:48:55] <shoky> then why not put an errorcode inside the returned json?
[20:49:23] <jrockjiggz> the returned data isn't used
[20:49:30] <shoky> why not
[20:50:08] <jrockjiggz> because if success, the lightbox will just close.. i have ajaxsuccess returning to an outside callback which will perform based on the function
[20:50:29] <shoky> then change the ajaxsuccess
[20:50:36] <jrockjiggz> i will show u
[20:50:40] <shoky> to check the errorcode
[20:52:03] <jrockjiggz> i guess.. do you know what jqXhr uses to detect errors? can i not simulate error by php?
[20:52:12] <jrockjiggz> like die('error')? //doesn't work
[20:53:22] <thomedy> im trying to use .each to filter through buried divs and get the text insdie which should equal file paths  so that i can store those paths ina n array for printing an img tag later
[20:53:30] <shoky> jrockjiggz, you probably can
[20:53:37] <shoky> but that would be the wrong way to do it
[20:54:10] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/YwKKZ3t7
[20:54:12] <shoky> jrockjiggz i imagine it uses the HTTP return code
[20:54:26] <jrockjiggz> hmm.. this is the structure http://jsfiddle.net/sfXpv/
[20:57:59] <shoky> ok: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/sfXpv/1/
[20:58:37] <shoky> thomedy and the problem is ?
[21:06:42] <thomedy> sorry shoky.. the problem is that if you looked at the pastebin that each should dig deep into the tower of divs and grabs the path but it grabs more paths then its supposed to it starts in view-field-1 or something like that but its grabbing paths from views field 2 as well
[21:06:56] <thomedy> and it should not go beyond that
[21:06:58] <thomedy> so im confused
[21:09:10] <thomedy> some how i have to get my buried paths into an array
[21:15:58] <shoky> ?demo @ thomedy

[23:45:54] <wuwoot> serdem: the previous one worked just fine, but thanks for catching any issues. =D
[23:46:52] <serdem> wuwoot, when you clicked on the slided one it wouldn't toggleup at the first code.now it does.
[23:49:42] <beancurd> Mayazcherquoi: //do something... this.css('background-color', 'red');
[23:49:55] <Mayazcherquoi> this, ahk.
[23:49:56] <Mayazcherquoi> Thank you :)
[23:50:34] <wuwoot> serdam: got it. mucho thanks!
[23:50:41] <beancurd> or you can use $('.someClass').css('property', 'value');
[23:51:15] <beancurd> if you wanted to target something other than the thing being mousedin/out.
[23:56:09] <Mayazcherquoi> beancurd: That does not work :-(
[23:57:30] <beancurd> at what point doesn't it work?
[23:58:34] <Mayazcherquoi> It simply doesn't work. The CSS properties of the element do not change when mousing in and mousing out.
