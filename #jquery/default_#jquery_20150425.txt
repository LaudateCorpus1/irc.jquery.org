[00:01:52] <ANJ7> hey guys
[00:02:15] <ANJ7> http://creationofgod.cf/template.html
[00:02:34] <ANJ7> I want the dropdown to stay while i hove on it.
[00:02:39] <ANJ7> How can I do that?
[01:23:02] <floatingpoint> Is there a way for me to catch a 404 event on my page (for when external media doesn't load)?
[05:16:40] <zelol> can someone tell how to chain select2 with 4.0 version
[05:16:41] <zelol> ?
[05:18:28] <bepolite> zelol: 4.0?
[05:18:30] <bepolite> of what?
[05:18:38] <zelol> 4.0 of select2
[05:18:50] <zelol> plugin
[05:18:54] <bepolite> Ahhh
[05:27:36] <randomguy1> does css('name', null) remove a style element?
[05:28:56] <decx> every property has its default value
[05:29:36] <decx> none, inherit, auto and more
[05:29:47] <randomguy1> gotcha
[05:30:00] <randomguy1> other than that you'd have to remove the style attribute all together?
[05:30:14] <decx> that would be easiest
[05:37:11] <randomguy1> i'm stuck trolling stackoverflow.  someone save me!!
[05:48:04] <Expel> Hello, does anyone know how to combine two variables into one? Lets say I have var a = "bla"; and var b = "blabla"; how can I combine this two variables into one varible?
[05:48:47] <arthurvr> You mean you’d like to concat the strings? Or make it an object? Or an array of two items? One variables stores one object (one string, number, whatever)
[05:49:45] <Expel> arthurvr: I've tried like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/48556cb1901d52cc797a
[05:49:55] <Expel> And it didn't really work
[05:50:05] <decx> those are objects , not strings
[05:50:09] <chriys> Hey guys, for a reason that I ignore my code apply the last 2 lines only to the first :even element http://jsfiddle.net/8968qgx3/
[05:50:20] <decx> if you want to extend a collection use .add() or change your selector
[05:50:27] <chriys> the first line does work on all the selected
[05:50:33] <Expel> decx: Alright, thanks for a quick answer guys
[05:53:24] <chriys> How can I debug it?
[05:53:28] <decx> chriys: ids have to be unique
[05:53:40] <decx> i assume all your li have #thumbnailand #details in them
[05:54:12] <chriys> OH yeah that's true -_-'
[05:54:30] <decx> change them into classes and set your li as context
[05:54:38] <decx> $('.thumbnail', this)
[05:54:45] <decx> or find or whatever you like
[05:54:49] <chriys> but when I use classes it does it everywhere
[05:54:55] <decx> not with context
[05:55:01] <chriys> Oh I was looking for something like that
[05:55:04] <decx> you have to traverse from your origin
[05:55:05] <chriys> :D let me try
[05:56:03] <chriys> decx: :D Amazing it works !
[05:56:05] <chriys> Thx a lot
[06:05:08] <ilhami> hey
[06:05:12] <ilhami> I have a problem with jQuery
[06:06:59] <bepolite> ?ask @ ilhami
[06:06:59] <b-ot> ilhami: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:07:03] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/7DyY I cannot get the status code in the callback.
[06:07:30] <ilhami> I get status 401 back from the server but cannot log that line
[06:07:32] <ilhami> to the console.
[06:11:01] <ilhami> I guess I can use the error:
[06:11:04] <ilhami> option
[06:46:19] <gumanji> hello jqrs, i'm having a problem trying to get a result, spent already 6 hours on this :( , but my limited knowledge dosen't help:  trying to group the image links in a list by the alt atribute of the image ( a color ) and on select return each of the array elements.
[06:46:43] <gumanji> here is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/194znbh8/3/
[06:48:09] <gumanji> if anyone would be smart and kind enough to help, you'll make a bad wannabe programmer happy.
[06:48:48] <arthurvr> gumanji: if you open the browser console you’ll see you have multiple syntax errors in there :)
[06:49:07] <arthurvr> first fix those, then we can take a look at the logic of your script
[06:50:02] <gumanji> arthurvr: yea, i couldn't wrap my head on how to write that function to return the arrays
[06:50:43] <gumanji> if you could you give me a hint/link on that, maybe 50% of my problems would be solved :d
[06:50:57] <arthurvr> gumanji: I (or anyone else in the channel) will help you with it, but first fix the syntax. you’ve got some quotes too much and a mismatching param
[06:51:12] <arthurvr> L10 and L20
[06:52:37] <Uhkis> try the jshint button at the top
[06:52:47] <arthurvr> that too, yes
[07:04:03] <micqo> hello, everyone! guys, I'm learning JS and JQuery, and one thing I don't understand makes me restless. I perfectly understand that $('#element').click(function (event) {}); returns event object - so that later we could, for example ...{event.preventDefault();}... but we also could name the event object "e" and it will still work. but why? if we don't explicitly use some reserved word which is strictly reserved for event object or something?
[07:04:52] <arthurvr> micqo: are girls also allowed to answer? ;)
[07:05:16] <micqo> i.e. how Jquery knows it's still event object? what is it I don't understand about JS/JQuery?
[07:05:24] <micqo> arthurvr, of course :-)
[07:05:55] <arthurvr> micqo: what you call it doesn’t really make sense - the callback takes it as an argument, which you can name as you like.
[07:06:20] <gumanji> sorry about that guys, i'm just too tired i think, at least i've solved the syntax errors i think : http://jsfiddle.net/194znbh8/5/
[07:06:34] <arthurvr> micqo: just like function (b) { alert(b); } does the same as function (a) { alert(a); }
[07:07:45] <gumanji> so again - i'm having a problem trying to get a result, spent already 6 hours on this :( , but my limited knowledge dosen't help:  trying to group the image links in a list by the alt atribute of the image ( a color ) and on select return each of the array elements. - here is the  code http://jsfiddle.net/194znbh8/5/
[07:07:56] <arthurvr> gumanji: okay let’s move forward. As you can see in the console, $this isn’t defined, simply because you didn’t define it.
[07:08:06] <arthurvr> gumanji: guess you want it to be $(this)
[07:08:56] <micqo> arthurvr, mmm, okaaay :-) but your example is more straightforward and I clearly see why it works. you said: "the callback takes it as an argument" - but how does it know it's the right argument?
[07:09:29] <micqo> how does it know it's event object?
[07:09:46] <arthurvr> micqo: because it’s the first argument ;)
[07:09:59] <arthurvr> micqo: that’s why the order of arguments makes sense
[07:10:55] <gumanji> you are right arthurvr , still don't feel i've progressed to much http://jsfiddle.net/194znbh8/6/ :))
[07:11:11] <micqo> arthurvr, ahaaam. got it. so callbacks in JQuery are _designed_ in such cases to take the first argument as event object? :-P
[07:11:26] <arthurvr> micqo: that’s just how javascript works
[07:11:58] <arthurvr> micqo: identifier of an argument doesn’t make sense in there, only the order in which you take and the order in which you pass the arg
[07:12:28] <arthurvr> gumanji: well now you at least have a clean console :D I guess you don’t really get how .each works, lemme explain
[07:13:12] <arthurvr> gumanji: as you can see on the api docs, .each returns the jQuery object it’s called on, that’s why you see `[object Object]`
[07:13:30] <arthurvr> gumanji: and thus that’s what ends up in your `category`
[07:13:32] <arthurvr> got it?
[07:14:22] <gumanji> ok so i've actaully created an object, not an array.
[07:14:23] <gumanji> hmm
[07:14:33] <arthurvr> gumanji: yup
[07:14:38] <arthurvr> you didn’t create it
[07:14:45] <arthurvr> you can’t change what .each() returns
[07:15:05] <gumanji> ok.
[07:15:23] <gumanji> so each returns objects got it
[07:15:34] <arthurvr> each returns the jQuery object you called it on
[07:16:13] <arthurvr> do you just want `category` to be an array of all the colors in `alt` attributes?
[07:16:28] <micqo> arthurvr, thank you _so much_. :-) so, I guess I need to finish events JS reading, is this where I should look into?
[07:16:53] <arthurvr> micqo: learn.jquery.com is your best friend :D
[07:18:22] <gumanji> arthurvr: i want a way to be able to group and return the links in the list by the alt attribute, so i want to return from the list all the alt="brown" image links
[07:18:33] <bepolite> ilhami: I can't even open the site you posted
[07:18:57] <micqo> arthurvr, yes, I was reading exactly that and didn't find in-depth explanation for this. so the question arose.
[07:18:59] <imacinto> how would I write a Jasmine test for this? http://jsfiddle.net/bangarang/74441cc0/1/ -- should I include jQuery on my testRunner page or create a spy to mimic jQuery? I feel like option 2 is better, but I don't know how
[07:19:06] <micqo> arthurvr, it was here http://learn.jquery.com/events/introduction-to-events/#the-event-object
[07:19:39] <arthurvr> micqo: well, honestly, we consider it as required javascript knowledge when reading that
[07:19:58] <arthurvr> how callbacks/argument lists/indentifiers work is quite basic javascript, you know
[07:19:59] <ilhami> bepolite, because you were asleep. :P
[07:20:14] <ilhami> I set the expiration time on one hour
[07:20:25] <ilhami> now the paste is gone. :P
[07:20:30] <arthurvr> micqo: like we were telling in http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/ :D
[07:20:32] <ilhami> but I solved it. Never mind.
[07:20:37] <gumanji> wish i would have asked my question  when i wasn't dead tired from trying to do it myself :(
[07:20:38] <bepolite> Nice
[07:21:15] <micqo> arthurvr, yes, I understand, I guess callbacks are my weak spot. O:-)
[07:21:33] <arthurvr> micqo: ;)
[07:21:43] <Uhkis> gumanji: http://jsfiddle.net/194znbh8/7/ is this what you wanted?
[07:22:49] <micqo> arthurvr, thank you a lot. :-) btw, why did you even ask whether girls can respond or not? :-D
[07:23:16] <Uhkis> because you started with "guys, "
[07:23:34] <arthurvr> yup ^
[07:23:45] <arthurvr> though it’s a nitpick it’s a rule irc.jquery.com
[07:23:59] <JamesMcGill> hi I'm using a tab control, and I've also assigned a click event on the tab to contact the server and fetch and add data. But since doing this the tab control doesn't work - e.g the tab pane is not displayed. I'm assuming that this is because I bound a click event to the tab and it has taken it away from the tab plugin. Is there a way to pass control to the plugin once I've finished ?
[07:24:42] <micqo> oh come on. "guys" doesn't necessarily refer to guys, strictly speaking. O:-)
[07:25:07] <gumanji> Uhkis: it dose what i wanted, wish i'd understand how the magic works
[07:25:35] <Uhkis> arthurvr: "google first, ask questions later" as the first rule :D at least 50% of questions here can be answered by "?g <problem>" :D
[07:25:35] <imacinto> I don't see a "guys" rule on this site
[07:26:21] <Uhkis> gumanji: ill try to add some comments to explain it better
[07:26:32] <micqo> anyway, I'm happy to any response, regardless who it comes from :-)
[07:26:48] <arthurvr> Uhkis: yeah haha :D
[07:28:18] <ser0rr> why doesn't jQuery use requestanimationframe?
[07:28:31] <arthurvr> ser0rr: we will use it again by the next major release (3.0)
[07:28:44] <arthurvr> ser0rr: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/72119e0023dcc0d9807caf6d988598b74abdc937 if you want to read the code/discussion around it
[07:29:10] <ser0rr> arthurvr: awesome news
[07:29:20] <ser0rr> arthurvr: how did you track down the commit that quick?
[07:29:29] <arthurvr> I’m used to the codebase lol
[07:30:28] <ser0rr> awesome, why? I always feel like dumb when reading through the god damn jQuery source code
[07:31:16] <ser0rr> people suggest to refer to the jQuery source code often? Do you all really do that?
[07:32:04] <arthurvr> ser0rr: I do really really hope people do but I don’t guess so
[07:33:08] <Uhkis> gumanji: i hope this helps http://jsfiddle.net/194znbh8/8/ (and is correct :D)
[07:33:29] <arthurvr> woot Uhkis you rock lol
[07:33:37] <Uhkis> ? :D
[07:34:03] <arthurvr> doesn’t happen that often that people take their time to write up this quality of comments lollipop
[07:34:25] <ser0rr> yeah arthurvr is right Uhkis
[07:34:29] <Uhkis> [17:25] < gumanji> Uhkis: it dose what i wanted, wish i'd understand how the magic works
[07:34:39] <Uhkis> he said he didn't understand so i wanted to help!
[07:34:49] <arthurvr> of course :D
[07:35:04] <Uhkis> (also i'm REALLY bored :D)
[07:35:07] <ser0rr> Uhkis: what's your meaning about the above?
[07:35:41] <Uhkis> ser0rr: huh?
[07:36:19] <ser0rr> I just wanted more peoplez opinion on arthurvr and my thread about reading jQuery source code. Is it something people (expect arthurvr) actually do?
[07:38:01] <ser0rr> Uhkis: ^
[07:38:19] <gumanji> Uhkis: thanks, on the last bit of code, i'll try to do it with an each function, but after i have some rest. also how can you be bored when you can create such magic :)...
[07:38:46] <Uhkis> in all my time here, i've seen less than 10 refers to jquerys source
[07:39:01] <arthurvr> sad thing but probably the truth
[07:39:07] <Uhkis> almost all of them have been about animations for some reason..
[07:39:24] <arthurvr> haha really? lol
[07:39:39] <gtwy> https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/0fs2grqn/6/ why doesnt this work
[07:39:50] <Uhkis> except one weird x-browser bug
[07:39:53] <gtwy> tried return false; and preventDefault();
[07:39:54] <arthurvr> not that the documentation about animations isn’t clear is it?
[07:40:01] <gtwy> but clicking the button still continues
[07:40:26] <arthurvr> Uhkis: actually that’s in fact super sad but sadly it’s true :(
[07:40:48] <ser0rr> I should learn to do it more. Paul irish suggested it in 2 screencasts as well
[07:41:17] <decx> gtwy:  the edge jquery is on http and gets blocks because mixed assets
[07:41:40] <gtwy> wow
[07:41:45] <gtwy> i switched to 2.1.3 and all good
[07:41:45] <gtwy> thanks
[07:42:24] <ser0rr> I just tend to think it's all super hard
[07:42:37] <Uhkis> arthurvr: wasn't that long ago when someone asked about something that was in there but undocumented for some actual reason
[07:43:12] <arthurvr> hmm I don’t remember that but might be totally right. We have some animation stuff undocumented
[07:43:41] <ser0rr> way harder than reading for example, all day applications source code
[07:45:44] <ser0rr> anyways thanks everybody
[07:45:50] <ser0rr> Uhkis:arthurvr:^
[07:46:15] <ser0rr> another javascript related question
[07:46:37] <ser0rr> why is JavaScript spelled like JavaScript and not like Javascript?
[07:47:01] <arthurvr> ser0rr: because that’s just the name. Do you like it if we spell you nick like SeR0Rr?
[07:47:33] <ser0rr> there's a ground of truth in what you're telling arthurvr
[07:47:47] * ser0rr needs to leave
[07:48:12] <decx> a Javascript would be a script in Java, don't want to confuse people /s
[07:48:30] <ser0rr> see you all. arthurvr: thanks you're an incredibly smart guy
[07:48:36] <ser0rr> and all the others in here, of course
[07:48:37] <arthurvr> you’re welcome
[07:49:21] <arthurvr> decx: would that confusion really still exist? oh boy
[07:49:27] <arthurvr> haha
[07:49:31] <Uhkis> oh god, that reminded me about vocational schools diploma..
[07:49:39] <Uhkis> javascript course was named "Java"
[07:49:56] <arthurvr> really? My god
[07:49:58] <decx> should'Ve called it Netscape#
[07:50:19] <Uhkis> at that point i didn't have any Java knowledge whatsoever, it was fun in job interviews
[07:50:27] <arthurvr> ”Javascript, known as Java for short…”
[07:50:32] <Uhkis> "oh you got highest grade in Java, that helps a lot!" no... :D
[07:50:39] <arthurvr> JavaScript with a capital S of course
[07:50:56] <flyingoracle> Having a small issue with my variable scopes. I'm trying to implement deffered/promise objects with my ajax call. I want to use the "then" method but I can't access the deffered object because it is in an anonymouse function....how do I rearrange this!? Im very confused.  http://jsbin.com/vevojefose/1/edit?js
[07:52:26] <flyingoracle> If anyone can take a look an advise - I'd be most grateful
[07:52:55] <s00_r> does anyone of you know TodoMVC?
[07:53:15] <s00_r> coming back for 5 minutes
[07:53:22] <s00_r> I was just looking at the jQuery implementation
[07:53:25] <s00_r> have a question
[07:53:41] <s00_r> why don't they just use .delegate()?
[07:53:53] <arthurvr> where? Link to the source code would be handy
[07:56:00] <gtwy> what do you guys use to write code and manage your site
[07:56:06] <gtwy> i have dreamweaver set to code view only
[07:56:13] <gtwy> and i use it to sync too
[07:56:19] <gtwy> is there a better option out there? dreamweaver isnt very good
[07:56:30] <gtwy> sorry this seems off topic but i figure this is a good place to get some answers
[07:56:49] <arthurvr> gtwy: that’s just super opinionated. Some like dreamweaver, I like vim, other people like other things.
[07:57:18] <arthurvr> gtwy: the only thing I can say is that you should feel good in it and be productive in it
[07:57:19] <gtwy> i am looking for something that will sync the website here locally so i can edit it and then resync it
[07:57:26] <gtwy> vim doesnt do that
[07:57:35] <gtwy> if im working through ssh ill use vim
[07:57:38] <gtwy> but thats super rare
[07:57:48] <arthurvr> I don’t want to have that discussion, but you shouldn’t be caring about that
[07:58:11] <arthurvr> Reloading/debugging/previewing should happen in a real browser, using something like browsersync IMHO.
[07:58:50] <arthurvr> but again that’s a super opinionated question, everybody will like something else, so let us please just not discuss this. Try it, you don’t like it, don’t use it and try something else.
[07:59:02] <gtwy> im looking for suggestions
[07:59:08] <gtwy> i dont like dreamweaver so im not arguing for them
[07:59:16] <gtwy> i am looking to change
[07:59:20] <gtwy> vim is out tho
[07:59:26] <arthurvr> vim, webstorm, phpstorm, atom, sublime text, … are all things you should try.
[07:59:57] <arthurvr> and vim is awesome IMHO, but you should give it your time to explore it and not get frustrated by it from the first time.
[08:00:10] <arthurvr> gtwy: what platform are you on?
[08:03:08] <gtwy> windows and osx
[08:03:14] <gtwy> windows at my work desk and osx on my laptop
[08:03:21] <gtwy> and linux on all of my servers
[08:03:22] <gtwy> hehehehehehe
[08:03:38] <gtwy> i am a lover of all os-religions. i do not pick
[08:03:48] <arthurvr> so my suggestion would be to chooce something that works cross-platform, so you don’t need to have separated settings and stuff.
[08:03:58] <arthurvr> def. do try atom
[08:04:00] <gtwy> another issue with dw
[08:04:06] <gtwy> the settings by default SUCK
[08:04:10] <gtwy> and its really tedious to change them all
[08:04:13] <gtwy> and no easy way to sync
[08:04:16] <arthurvr> https://atom.io/
[08:04:24] <arthurvr> built on web tech itself
[08:04:30] <arthurvr> awesomesauce, really
[08:04:56] <gtwy> when i type a function into atom does it give me a little hint popup
[08:04:59] <gtwy> with how to use it ?
[08:05:14] <gtwy> thats not a deal breaker
[08:05:16] <gtwy> but im curious
[08:06:18] <arthurvr> gtwy: you mean a linting popup? screenshot plz? Many popups can show up
[08:07:01] <gtwy> im gonna download it and try it
[08:10:50] <gtwy> arthurvr: there are packages you can install for atom?
[08:11:02] <arthurvr> yes it even has a package mananger and stuff
[08:11:12] <gtwy> pretty sure this is amazing
[08:11:12] <arthurvr> it’s nearly as awesome as vim
[08:11:15] <arthurvr> yes it is
[08:11:28] <arthurvr> but it’s beginner friendly, that’s the point
[08:11:52] <gtwy> arthurvr: thx
[08:11:56] <s00_r> Vim and atom are both awesome
[08:12:08] <s00_r> used atom since it came out
[08:12:14] <s00_r> switching back and forth
[08:12:15] <gtwy> yeah i use vim a lot when im on ssh but i dont always have that luxery
[08:12:28] <arthurvr> vim isn’t limited to ssh lollipop
[08:13:03] <gtwy> i dont always have internet access
[08:13:16] <gtwy> i guess i could scp the site before leaving internet area
[08:13:18] <arthurvr> that’s not important
[08:13:26] <gtwy> and then scp it when i get back
[08:13:28] <arthurvr> You can just use it locally lol
[08:14:20] <arthurvr> but questions about that in #vim I’d say
[08:19:49] <s00_r> ok so this channel has 666 people in it
[08:19:54] <s00_r> scary
[08:20:06] <gtwy> 665
[08:20:28] <s00_r> somebody left NOOOO
[08:20:41] <gtwy> paraxial: congrats, youre user 666
[08:20:58] <s00_r> ahhh paraxial waited for you

[08:31:24] <Uhkis> arthurvr: so to girls you are? hahaa!

[08:31:51] <arthurvr> haha
[08:31:54] <arthurvr> oh boy
[08:32:02] <arthurvr> spotted the `boy`
[08:32:03] <arthurvr> lol
[08:32:09] <arthurvr> It difficult ya know
[08:32:33] <Uhkis> "i'm not guys" :p
[08:32:40] <arthurvr> yeah I saw
[08:32:42] <Kartagis> arthurvr: if you spent one more hour, it's be 24
[08:32:42] <arthurvr> pff haha
[08:32:51] <Kartagis> it'd be*
[08:33:01] <s00_r> can I do things like $('body').ready() ??
[08:33:14] <Kartagis> s00_r: document
[08:33:21] <s00_r> why only document?
[08:33:54] <Kartagis> good question, I'll let arthurvr answer that
[08:34:42] <arthurvr> because your page can only be ready once. It would first of all be useless, and more importantly, it’s just how browser behave (as in not using jQuery this is the behaviour too)
[08:34:55] <s00_r> makes sense but I can pass it more then `document` right?
[08:35:07] <s00_r> Kartagis:^
[08:35:33] <arthurvr> well It technically has two behaviours, but as you can see in the api docs, the $().ready() isn’t recommended
[08:35:55] <s00_r> okay good to hear that
[08:36:06] <s00_r> Thanks Kartagis and thanks arthurvr (again)
[08:37:21] <s00_r> arthurvr: Kartagis: I always find it confusing that jQuery.ajax takes an object and $.get not, am I the only one?
[08:37:40] <arthurvr> s00_r: you’re not, that’s why we changed it in jQuery 3.0
[08:37:47] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ as an FYI
[08:37:51] <Sal> hi

[08:48:09] <Sal> thanks
[11:09:32] <amikrop> If I do a $.ajax() on some link's .click() is it guarranteed that it will be complete, even if I don't prevent default?
[11:10:08] <amikrop> I don't want to prevent default, I want to follow the links href (after the ajax, making the ajax gets completed sooner or later)
[11:10:24] <amikrop> making sure*
[11:12:42] <amikrop> I mean, I have to do event.preventDefault(); $.post(...); window.location = this.href; ?
[11:13:11] <amikrop> Or just $.post(...); will do, making sure the ajax call gets completed sooner or later?
[11:13:48] <amikrop> anyone?
[11:16:35] <Uhkis> $.post().done(redirect here)
[11:16:58] <amikrop> but is this necessary?
[11:17:18] <Uhkis> this what
[11:17:20] <amikrop> I dont mind the ajax call being unsynchronous
[11:17:25] <amikrop> asynchronous
[11:17:32] <amikrop> with the link following
[11:17:44] <amikrop> I just want to make sure it will be completed sooner or later
[11:18:08] <amikrop> the question is, if I dont prevent default, could the ajax call be interrupted?
[11:18:08] <Uhkis> you have to use preventdefault or it will instantly follow the link
[11:19:01] <amikrop> hmm but .click(function() { alert('hello') }); will get executed even if i dont prevent default
[11:19:14] <amikrop> (and then the link will be followed)
[11:19:27] <amikrop> but the alert will be shown normally
[11:21:55] <Uhkis> because alert freezes the browser
[11:46:07] <ilhami> alerts are annoying. :P

[16:34:40] <bobjondon1> hi .. can any one confirm that chrome 42 broke webaudio / mp3 output?
[17:06:50] <ezy_e> I have a list of yes/no radio buttons and need to determine whether they have all been clicked or not. If all buttons are clicked, then i would like to display a button. What is the most efficient way to achieve this? Any help would be very much appreciated
[18:20:29] <strrr> Is it more expensive to call $.addClass('some-class') than to check if $.hasClass('some-class')? Use case: I need to add a class if it doesn't already have it, so should I even bother checking existence in the first place?
[18:20:30] <strrr> nevermind
