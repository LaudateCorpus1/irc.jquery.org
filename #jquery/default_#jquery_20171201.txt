[04:55:12] <Neo1> hi
[15:19:35] <amundir> chat log full of renames
[15:22:21] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:22:25] <robertmaxrees> and joins/quits
[16:09:46] <poboy> this is valid if you want to determine if a checkbox is checked, right?
[16:10:00] <poboy> if ($('#milestone_management_internal input[name="milestone_completed"]:checked').length) { console.log('here);}
[16:10:15] <amundir> sure
[16:10:42] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the markup, probably?
[16:11:29] <amundir> there isn't a syntatical issue
[16:11:46] <robertmaxrees> actually, there is.
[16:11:53] <robertmaxrees> missing quote in the console log.
[16:11:57] <amundir> lol
[16:12:00] <amundir> dang
[16:12:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> which will break.
[16:16:32] <nikio_> how can i set the request header with $.get
[16:17:19] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ for debugging purposes?
[16:17:32] <nikio_> no, basic auth
[16:18:06] <robertmaxrees> gotta use beforeSend: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3258685/923919
[16:18:23] <nikio_> so i cant use $.get ?
[16:18:24] <nikio_> :/
[16:19:02] <amundir> Are you trying to get them authed, or are they already authed and you are trying to put their auth token on the request?
[16:19:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it's pretty trivial to switch to just $.ajax
[16:20:13] <nikio_> get the athed
[16:20:20] <nikio_> get the authed
[16:20:31] <nikio_> them lol
[16:20:35] <amundir> i got ya
[16:23:35] <nikio_> ok thx. was just curious if there was a work around so you could use $.get
[16:23:39] <nikio_> it has a nicerapi
[16:29:25] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ erm.
[16:29:31] <robertmaxrees> $.get is the same api as $.ajax
[16:33:29] <nikio_> hmm
[16:33:36] <nikio_> not rly
[16:33:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:33:43] <nikio_> differen func args
[16:33:56] <amundir> get is a wrapper around ajax
[16:34:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:34:11] <nikio_> yup
[16:34:11] <robertmaxrees> same args.  get just sets some "Defaults" for you.
[16:34:38] <nikio_> you pass an object to .ajax
[16:34:47] <nikio_> to .get you give an url
[16:34:53] <nikio_> and then a func
[16:35:12] <robertmaxrees> you can pass just a url to ajax.
[16:35:24] <robertmaxrees> and then use .then() for the callback (which you want anyway)
[16:35:32] <nikio_> but youant pass beforeSend to .get
[16:35:38] <nikio_> * you cant
[16:35:41] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/#jQuery-get-settings
[16:35:44] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[16:35:51] <robertmaxrees> using an object instead of strings.
[16:36:25] <robertmaxrees> but at that point you might as well skip the wrapper (shrug)
[16:36:44] <nikio_> you mean .get({url: bla, etc}, funcyion(){
[16:37:08] <robertmaxrees> ""A set of key/value pairs that configure the Ajax request. All properties except for url are optional. A default can be set for any option with $.ajaxSetup(). See jQuery.ajax( settings ) for a complete list of all settings. The type option will automatically be set to GET.""
[16:37:17] <amundir> you can treat get() just like ajax(), you'd just leave off the type/method
[16:37:18] <robertmaxrees> from the docs for $.get() :)
[16:37:28] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:37:53] <nikio_> hmm
[16:38:00] <nikio_> ok thanks\
[16:49:51] <SpecialT_> is there a channel for vue.js?
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> #vuejs probably
[16:50:38] <SpecialT_> cool thanks
[20:20:59] <bkxd> bootstrap is loading jQuery at the footer of my template 'base.html', but I need to use jQuery above it in the body of my document. Do i need to reload jQuery at the header of my template / base.html as well?
[20:21:17] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't load jquery more than once.
[20:21:22] <robertmaxrees> how are you loading bootstrap?
[20:23:09] <robertmaxrees> bkxd
[20:23:28] <bkxd> robertmaxrees: some javascript calls at the bottom of my html file
[20:23:39] <bkxd> robertmaxrees: to speed up page loading
[20:23:52] <bkxd> (im coding in django so using templates)
[20:23:56] <robertmaxrees> so if you care about page perf, then everything should be after them.
[20:24:08] <robertmaxrees> if you have files that have rely on jquery, they should come after that include.
[20:24:11] <bkxd> robertmaxrees: but then it seems to break my ajax calls
[20:24:21] <bkxd> in the body of the page
[20:24:25] <bkxd> as jQuery isnt '
[20:24:28] <bkxd> called yet
[20:24:38] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:24:55] <robertmaxrees> are you binding event listeners in your HTML or something?
[20:25:22] <bkxd> actually im just trying to render a chart using an AJAX call to my api
[20:25:33] <bkxd> the chart is in javascript and uses $.get()
[20:25:47] <robertmaxrees> then moving jquery to the footer shouldn't matter.
[20:25:53] <robertmaxrees> unless you have scrript tags in your body.
[20:26:06] <bkxd> ah, i do have script tags in my body - why does that matter?
[20:26:12] <bkxd> arent they required to run the JS chart?
[20:26:17] <robertmaxrees> well, wait.
[20:26:31] <robertmaxrees> are you putting script tags, like, interspersed with the rest of your markup?
[20:26:41] <bkxd> yeah, is that wrong?
[20:27:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you should have everything in js files linked in the right spots.
[20:27:08] <robertmaxrees> like, at the bottom of the page.
[20:27:10] <bkxd> similar to this, except the jQuery is call is in the footer https://github.com/peopledoc/django-chartjs/blob/master/demo/demoproject/templates/line_chart.html
[20:27:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no.
[20:27:25] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[20:27:26] <bkxd> sorry, jQuery include, not call
[20:27:38] <robertmaxrees> stuff like $.get('{% url 'line_chart_json' %}', function (data) { is a code smell.
[20:27:57] <bkxd> interesting - so whats the alternative, put it in the footer?
[20:28:02] <bkxd> or use different code
[20:28:10] <robertmaxrees> put it into a js file instead.
[20:28:29] <robertmaxrees> and then put that url into a psuedo "namespace" object attached to the window.
[20:28:47] <robertmaxrees> window.myApp = { line_chart_json: 'someurl.com/foo' };
[20:29:07] <robertmaxrees> then you pop all that after your bootstrap/jquery includes.
[20:31:14] <robertmaxrees> anyway, i gotta jet. good luck :)
[20:36:32] <bkxd> robertmaxrees: sorry, my IRC crashed, then my WiFi crashed... =/ would you mind repeating that? im not really familiar with writing JS files and namespaces
[20:37:49] <shoky> bkxd: he's gone.  http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/latest.log.html
[20:38:37] <bkxd> shoky: legend
[20:41:48] <bkxd> is there a howto guide somewhere on properly structuring your calls to jquery without using script tags in the body?
[20:43:12] <SideFX> I'm trying to use an ajax call to popular a <select> with <option>s, what is the best method to do this?
[20:44:06] <SideFX> I tried doing id="whatever" for the select and gpomg $(#whatever).html and just have all the options from the ajax call be applied but nothing seems to be populated
