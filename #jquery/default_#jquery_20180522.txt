[07:49:23] <rocketmagnet> hi all, when i have a <div class="button"></div>, what's wrong with $(".button").click(function(){ window.alert("test");  }); ??
[07:50:42] <Cork> nothing, except you shouldn't use alert for testing
[07:52:40] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ef0w0dLu/
[07:52:57] <Cork> though it might be you're generating the element after the selector searches and then it won't find the element
[07:53:24] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ef0w0dLu/1/
[07:53:50] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ef0w0dLu/2/
[07:54:08] <Cork> if that isn't the cause, you need to reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[08:45:56] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/oy9ck4wz/48/ line 109-112 not working....click edit....edit a servicename value and hit save to see the error displayed in the console
[09:13:00] <AdamPDotty> attr('name') returns a string and those do not provide a function "each"
[09:13:15] <AdamPDotty> n>'test'.each;
[09:14:40] <dimi1947> AdamPDotty:Ok then...I will put it this way.
[09:15:43] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/oy9ck4wz/68/ line 106...
[09:16:55] <dimi1947> this code grabs the number in this:form[update][0][service]...
[09:17:40] <dimi1947> whenever you go edit a service value(after clicking edit)...the name attribute value takes this form
[09:18:24] <AdamPDotty> "name attribute value"
[09:18:30] <AdamPDotty> Is this buzz word bingo?
[09:19:06] <dimi1947> try editing hair and click save and look at the console
[09:19:55] <dimi1947> tell me if you have understood so far what I am trying to say
[09:21:01] <dimi1947> so that I can continue
[09:22:47] <dimi1947> Cork:are you here?
[10:24:34] <Cork> dimi1947: attr('name').each doesn't work
[10:24:52] <Cork> .attr('name') will give you the name of the first element, not an array
[10:25:07] * AdamPDotty said that over an hour ago.
[10:25:24] <Cork> and he didn't listen?
[10:25:46] <AdamPDotty> not a bit
[10:25:49] <Cork> lovely
[10:26:18] <Cork> i always find it a bit interesting when ppl don't look at what they get as output from a command
[10:28:53] <thykka> b-b-but I don't know how to read hebrew
[10:29:50] <AdamPDotty> tohu va bohu
[10:38:00] <dimi1947> Cork:yes...but have you understood what I am trying to achieve here?
[10:38:16] <Cork> i suspect you want to grab all names
[10:38:26] <Cork> but you can't do that with .attr
[10:39:31] <dimi1947> I want to grab the digit in this from every edited input: form[update][0][servicename]
[10:39:40] <Cork> try $.map($("input[name*='form[update]']"), function(elm) { return elm.name.match(/^form\[update\]\[(\d+)\]/)[1]; })
[10:39:51] <dimi1947> hmmmm
[10:39:59] <AdamPDotty> Cork had that up his sleeve all the time.
[10:41:14] <dimi1947> Cork:is the result supposed to be passed in an array?
[10:41:25] <Cork> dimi1947: yes
[10:41:31] <Cork> an array of the numbers
[10:41:48] <dimi1947> what is the name of the array in the example you gave me?
[10:41:55] <Cork> there isn't one
[10:42:06] <Cork> it is what you get back from the $.map()
[10:42:14] <Cork> so what ever you name it
[10:42:21] <dimi1947> can map be passed to a variable?
[10:42:31] <Cork> uhh...
[10:42:48] <Cork> it is a return value just like anything else in javascript
[10:42:57] <Cork> just store it in a variable if you want it
[10:43:02] <dimi1947> oh
[10:43:14] <dimi1947> give me a second to try it
[10:43:21] <thykka> n> [1, 2, 3].map(n => n + 1); n
[10:43:40] <thykka> n> var a = [1, 2, 3].map(n => n + 1); a
[10:43:45] <Cork> thykka: this is $.map not arra.map though
[10:44:02] <Cork> and there isn't a script bot in here
[10:44:03] <thykka> oh, right.. thought I was in ##javascript :X
[10:45:00] <dimi1947> Cork:like this for example?
[10:45:23] <dimi1947> line 106
[10:45:40] <Cork> you need to save and give a new link
[10:45:48] <Cork> (or rather update)
[10:46:21] <Cork> the /<nunber>/ changes
[10:47:24] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/oy9ck4wz/74/ line 106...I think it is OK now
[10:47:55] <Cork> uh...
[10:48:08] <Cork> you're kidding right?
[10:48:48] <dimi1947> no I am not kidding...yes I k now it is wrong?I cannot remember how to do it correctly
[10:48:56] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/oy9ck4wz/77/
[10:50:28] <dimi1947> I see...thanks
[10:50:50] <dimi1947> I think I had said that originally...that map needs to be passed to an array
[10:51:08] <Cork> passed _to an array_??
[10:51:40] <Cork> create an array i would understand but passed to an array doesn't compute
[10:53:30] <Cork> dimi1947: also as far as i can see you don't create any form elements
[10:54:11] <dimi1947> anyway...I am not a native english speaker....what do you mean I do not create any form element
[10:54:14] <Cork> ah it is form in the name of the input elements...
[10:54:32] <dimi1947> yeah
[10:54:38] <Cork> dimi1947: when you want a save button you should normally have a <form> tag around it
[10:54:49] <Cork> including the fields it should handle
[10:55:12] <dimi1947> a form tag in the save button?I do not get it
[10:55:33] <dimi1947> there is a handler for it
[10:55:54] <Cork> <form><input name="something" value="something else"><button class="save">save</button></form>
[10:56:16] <Cork> or more specifically
[10:56:43] <Cork> <form><input name="something" value="something else"><button type="submit">save</button><button type="reset">cancel</button></form>
[11:04:49] <dimi1947> what is the point in enclosing the save button in a form tag?
[11:20:02] <dimi1947> anyway
[11:55:54] <charolastra> Cork: hi again, you told me that 302 redirects for ajax requests are transperent. but they don't register as a success here. first 302 and then it GETs another page with 200
[12:07:55] <charolastra> well, it does in the 'status' field of the response data but doesn't trigger the success function
[17:31:58] <gambl0re> anyone have experience with socketio?
[17:32:34] <taplar> not enough to answer questions about it
[17:33:23] <taplar> there is a #socket.io room
[17:37:32] <robertmaxrees> cripes this has been a busy day
[17:37:46] <robertmaxrees> just realized I've been scrolled up like all day hahahaha
[17:38:03] <taplar> lmao
[17:40:03] <robertmaxrees> oh shit my band is up for a local award.
[18:34:35] <uranium[oc]70> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/JvVKyQ   any suggestions on getting image to work?
[18:35:56] <taplar> ##javascript
[18:36:05] <uranium[oc]70> they where useless >.<
[18:36:12] <uranium[oc]70> spent 30 min making that codepen for nothing
[18:36:24] <uranium[oc]70> but i think if ound the error +-
[18:36:26] <uranium[oc]70> not +=
[18:36:27] <uranium[oc]70> FML
[18:37:04] <taplar> what browser support must you write for?
[18:38:07] <uranium[oc]70> ie8+
[18:38:26] <taplar> well, crud, i was going to suggest template literals, but nvm, :)
[18:38:51] <uranium[oc]70> src='' no matter what i do >.<
[18:39:42] <taplar> you know you are like replacing elements over and over right?
[18:40:11] <taplar> all those repeated assignments to results[0], they are not cumulative
[18:40:16] <taplar> you are doing replaces
[18:40:57] <taplar> also that's a strange way to attempt that
[18:41:18] <uranium[oc]70> $('#searchResults').append(formatstuff);   in production
[18:41:31] <uranium[oc]70> wanted to show in codepen so changed a few lines
[18:41:50] <uranium[oc]70> your saying the 3d array is fubard?
[18:42:20] <taplar> as far as i can see this is a 2d array with the second depth only containing one element each
[18:42:22] <taplar> one second
[18:43:14] <uranium[oc]70> no
[18:43:17] <taplar> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xjeExG?editors=1010  i changed the first one
[18:43:19] <uranium[oc]70> >.<   you are correct
[18:43:35] <taplar> I put the first element as '', since you were staring your indexes at 1
[18:49:54] <uranium[oc]70> huzzah!
[18:49:56] <uranium[oc]70> taplar++
[18:50:16] <uranium[oc]70> not sure wtf i changed in the production code aside from +- , and  formatstuff += '/image/'+results[x][3]+''; // WAS RESULTS 3;    BUT IT WORKS
[18:50:21] <uranium[oc]70> /dont touch this block of code
[18:50:27] <uranium[oc]70> and onto the next project
[18:50:30] <taplar> heh
[18:50:44] <taplar> you should consider making like an html template and using that
[18:50:56] <taplar> rather than the markup in the code.  it would make it more readable
[18:51:05] <uranium[oc]70> link to example?
[18:51:27] <uranium[oc]70> or what i can google
[18:51:33] <uranium[oc]70> < can google for himself
[18:51:54] <uranium[oc]70> now to paginate the search results from this >.<
[18:52:07] <taplar> basically what it is is that you use the <template> tag, or if you want to work with older browsers, use a <script type="text/html" id="something">
[18:52:14] <taplar> and then you put your html inside that
[18:52:35] <taplar> when you want to use it, select that element, grab the inner html, pop it in a $(), replace the fields with values, and then add that to your page
[18:53:20] <taplar> if that makes sense
[18:53:24] <uranium[oc]70> so from what im getting,  make this div, display none it, clone it to $() element, then find and repalce innerhtml of what i need?
[18:53:36] <taplar> you don't have to clone or hide it
[18:53:46] <taplar> <script type="text/html"> will not display on the page
[18:53:48] <uranium[oc]70> Oh i guess i dont have it written to page
[18:53:50] <uranium[oc]70> i can just store it
[18:53:55] <taplar> and grabbing the html of that guy, no need to clone a string
[18:54:37] <uranium[oc]70> hmmm
[18:54:48] <taplar> i'll make a dummy example
[18:54:49] <uranium[oc]70> reading on the <template tag
[18:54:52] <uranium[oc]70> grab by tag
[18:55:00] <uranium[oc]70> < is on w3 looking /me hates w3 but im looking
[18:55:10] <uranium[oc]70> ya , wow
[18:55:14] <uranium[oc]70> ive never seen it done this way >.<
[18:55:14] <taplar> i'd recommend mdn vs w3c
[18:55:22] <uranium[oc]70> yea w3 is the pits
[18:57:37] <robertmaxrees> taplar w3schools you mean?
[18:57:46] <uranium[oc]70> ya
[18:58:07] <robertmaxrees> w3c != w3schools which is why i ask.
[18:58:13] <taplar> yeah
[18:58:13] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/L2bbzpov/
[18:58:47] <taplar> there are some performance improvement possibilities there, but it should give you an idea
[18:59:04] <uranium[oc]70> you can id a script mind = blown
[18:59:18] <taplar> sure
[18:59:33] <robertmaxrees> it's a node
[18:59:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:00:09] <taplar> if you are doing this a lot though, there are libraries dedicated to making this easier, like mustachejs and handlebarsjs
[19:00:19] <uranium[oc]70> tytyty taplar .... imma spend my next couple minutes rewriting this hopefully =D
[19:01:10] <taplar> i'm headed to the house.  have a good evening all
[19:01:18] <uranium[oc]70> night
