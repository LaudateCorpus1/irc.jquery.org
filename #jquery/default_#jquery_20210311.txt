[09:08:40] <robertparkerx> I'm stuck on a simple task https://i.imgur.com/RPznzvt.jpg how could I get asdasdsad button when in bottom left corner to slide up whatever amount of text there is in bottom divider
[09:08:55] <robertparkerx> I think I know there is .slideUp()
[09:09:17] <robertparkerx> wait
[09:10:29] <robertparkerx> have button and text div inside another div
[09:10:32] <robertparkerx> hide text div
[09:10:37] <robertparkerx> on click slideup
[15:01:10] <impliednude> I need to modify a specific class to display another. As such replaceall doesn't work. Because it removes all other classes also. Is there a method to do just that? Thanks
[15:02:27] <impliednude> lets say if I am dealing with say an element that has <div class="jess carly sarah"> and I want to rename jess to jan on all elements how would I go about this?
[15:04:55] <impliednude> would it be $( ".jess" ).replaceWith( $( ".jan" ) );
[15:05:59] <robertmaxrees> you want to rename one of the classes?
[15:06:23] <robertmaxrees> then you need to .removeClass('jess').addClass('jan')
[15:06:25] <robertmaxrees> impliednude
[15:12:16] <robertmaxrees> so the full line would be $('.jess').removeClass('jess').addClass('jan'); impliednude
[15:14:35] <impliednude> ahh
[15:15:22] <impliednude> Thank you robertmaxrees ^_^ was wondering why it was not working
[15:15:37] <impliednude> the jquery docs didn't give me a correct answer
[15:16:22] <robertmaxrees> just gotta re-frame the question :)  instead of "turn one class to another", you wanna remove a class and add another.
[15:53:42] <impliednude> what would prevent this from working btw?
[15:53:55] <impliednude> works on jsfiddle. not on my live site.
[15:54:21] <robertmaxrees> are the classes swapping out in your element inspector?
[16:38:32] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> not on my site. on fiddle yes.
[16:39:02] <impliednude> Kinda stuck wondering what situations it wont work. I am doing on document ready
[16:39:06] <robertmaxrees> no clue without seeing your code then.
[16:44:32] <impliednude> found out the issue. there was a script erroring -lesighs-
[16:44:54] <impliednude> that was using jquery also which stopped the rest of the loaded scripts from working
[16:48:20] <impliednude> okay, onto the next thing. I am using noticing in the markup for the same container a data-binding-vc="etc-xxxx" how would I get that removed? the data-binding-vc="etc-xxxx" portion
[16:49:42] <robertmaxrees> why would you remove it?
[16:50:20] <impliednude> I am debugging if the reason fancybox isn't work is because it has a data binding already and if I remove the stuff from that. I hope my registered js will actually work. sadly inspector isn't showing anything out of the ordinary
[16:50:46] <robertmaxrees> removing data-attributes won't fix anything in that case :/
[16:51:21] <impliednude> hmmm? what if its looking for the data attributes and a class name?
[16:52:52] <robertmaxrees> is it looking for those specifically?
[17:02:35] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> yep yep. I have a total of 4 scripts that are running on this system that I have debugged as being the culprits
[17:02:53] <impliednude> one of them is impeding on fancybox from kicking in for the images.
[17:03:01] <impliednude> or it could be all 3
[17:03:17] <impliednude> four of them*
[17:05:05] <impliednude> iono *shrugs* so I am hoping if I clean out the output it might allow me to get a better view of what's causing it.
[17:05:37] <impliednude> if I remove the data attributes, the class names, etc.. and its still causing fancybox not to kick in. then its one of the other modal/image lightbox system scripts
[17:07:12] <impliednude> if I go through all of them and its not working, then its probably fancybox
[17:08:14] <impliednude> I can get it to popup on its own via a none img element that isn't being impeded by any possibilities *aka .example").fancybox and it works just fine
[17:26:42] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was in meetings.
[17:27:25] <robertmaxrees> so you could remove those via jquery, but if they've already been accessed by jquery that won't do much since jquery creates a separate cache for data attrbutes.
[17:28:43] <robertmaxrees> impliednude so you'd have this scenario: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5hoc4s1p/
[17:28:57] <robertmaxrees> so you'll want to remove those attributes server-side instead.
[17:31:22] <impliednude> meh
[17:31:37] <impliednude> Thanks!!!
[17:31:59] <impliednude> just wish that whoever had this system setup ahead of time would have made sure things worked together properly
[17:32:33] <robertmaxrees> i usually say the same thing.  then git blame says it's all my fault.  damn liar, that is.
[17:51:04] <impliednude> yeah. I hear you.
[17:51:25] <impliednude> truth be told, I am still trying to figure out how to debug js. especially jquery
[17:51:51] <impliednude> regular js I have an idea. jquery none, especially in chrome where it starts the debug in jquery.js
[17:52:00] <impliednude> not the code that caused the issue
[17:52:16] <robertmaxrees> normally i don't even debug within jquery tbh.
[17:52:46] <impliednude> show off
[17:52:59] <robertmaxrees> lol not even that.  just usually not a concern.
[17:54:24] <impliednude> proves my point. show off :P
