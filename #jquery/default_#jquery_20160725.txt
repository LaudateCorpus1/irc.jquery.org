[00:54:04] <WhirledPress> having a hard time with getting content to match size and position of thumbnail for initial state in animation. http://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/kXJGrw
[00:54:09] <WhirledPress> any suggestions?
[04:49:41] <_Justice_> anyone would recomend a good form validator plugin?

[05:31:56] <Justice> krah
[05:46:52] <fauzie> boom
[06:12:10] <gingitsu1e> Can you move an input element without losing its value?
[06:12:40] <gingitsu1e> Or how would you reate a multitype form where the user can remove files vai an x button
[06:17:48] <geoid> greetz
[06:18:30] <geoid> I (for reasons beyond my control) need to be able to pass script tags as part of dynamic content for an element. It doesn't work. Is there a way to make it work? E.g.: https://jsfiddle.net/7uw7zmds/
[06:49:59] <_August_> i have a question. I have a 2 ajax functions being called and they're both very similar but some of the data is changed. So I am wondering if I can use clone() and change the data within it... http://pastie.org/private/vhvkzylw0fifi9qdta4ww
[06:50:42] <_August_> Right now im just copying everything and changing it and to me it just seems like a sloppy way to go about doing that
[08:18:47] <cerion> hi. I am trying to do CORS from what I understand but this does not work. My browser support CORS. The server with REST API I don't know. So first I get ACAO error in console that point me to the problem. I tried several thing and It oes not work. How do I do it ?
[08:22:48] <iamcurio> is there a way to populate an input field and on sumbit it will go to the next page and populate sumbit the input field on the next page?
[08:31:58] <imacange> Hi, I am rather new in jquery and I've been spending two days trying to set up autocomplete with an external php source. Anyone willing to assist me?
[08:42:12] <HD|Laptop> Hello all. I install jquery usually with npm install jquery, and then embed node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js
[08:42:23] <HD|Laptop> However jquery-ui has apparently no dist/ folder
[08:42:50] <HD|Laptop> So how do I use jquery-ui without having to resort to using webpack or other complex build tools?
[08:44:10] <shoky> download it?
[08:44:47] <imacange>  Hi, I am rather new in jquery and I've been spending two days trying to set up autocomplete with an external php source. Anyone willing to assist me?
[08:45:18] <Ahiiru> good morning
[08:45:21] <imacange> hey
[08:46:03] <shoky> imacange: people will only try to help if you actually ask a question and show what you've tried and say what's not working as you expect
[08:46:07] <AwkwardCough> hey imacange, you should ask your question about what is wrong. If someone can help they will :)
[08:46:21] <imacange> alright, tks AwkwardCough
[08:46:24] <shoky> asking "anyone willing to assist me?" is useless
[08:46:31] <imacange> lol, ok. tks
[08:46:40] <Ahiiru> I heard there's a vuknerability on jQuery Migrate 1.2.1
[08:46:42] <Ahiiru> what is it?
[08:46:57] <Ahiiru> sorry, jQuery Migrate 1.2.1 for wordpress
[08:47:19] <imacange> basically, I have a .php file call search.php which create a json from my odbc database and that seems to be working well
[08:47:41] <imacange> then I have a test.php file with the autocomplete but someone it does not load the data from my search.php
[08:48:24] <imacange> And here is the function I am using: $( function() { $( "#NAME" ).autocomplete({ source: 'search.php'}); } );
[08:49:16] <imacange> and I am using $_get['term']
[08:50:34] <shoky> that js looks ok.. so the problem is with the php probably ;)
[08:51:10] <Themediator> imacange: I was running into the same problem when I originally tried to do that a few months ago. The problem was an error in my PHP I think. I switched over to using django framework and it's way easier
[08:51:29] <imacange> oh ok
[08:51:54] <HD|Laptop> shoky: I want to avoid manual steps, that's why I want to use npm
[08:51:59] <Themediator> Now I just have an API entry for the list, and it grabs when the page loads
[08:52:07] <Themediator> No messy PHP to deal with
[08:52:36] <shoky> HD|Laptop: npm is for node modules, to be used with node or a tool that knows node modules ;)
[08:52:37] <imacange> ok, I am putting my code in a fiddle so you can see
[08:52:54] <shoky> HD|Laptop: i use browserify, fwiw...
[08:53:18] <shoky> npm install jquery jquery-ui;      var $ = require('jquery');  require('jquery-ui');
[08:53:27] <shoky> that does everything i need
[08:53:29] <shoky> except the css
[08:53:34] <HD|Laptop> Yeah but that wont include the css ;)
[08:53:42] <shoky> so? neither is what you're doing now
[08:53:51] <shoky> yuo0're manually embedding the js even..
[08:53:52] <HD|Laptop> I ran "grunt" in the jquery-ui folder, so far so good but it only produced a js file in dist/ folder
[08:53:59] <shoky> ok, grunt..
[08:54:05] <shoky> so you're using build tools anyway
[08:54:18] <shoky> oh
[08:54:50] <shoky> yyou're running it to build jquery-ui ?  eh.. thought you want to avoid manual steps :)
[08:55:01] <imacange> Ok, the fiddle will obviously not work but at least you can see my code here: https://jsfiddle.net/go0km7e7/1/
[08:55:28] <imacange> It's driving me nuts
[08:55:43] <shoky> imacange: first of all if you're responding with json, then why  header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8');
[08:55:49] <shoky> should be json content type
[08:56:21] <imacange> oh, yes. I was trying to solve the encoding and I forgot to remove that line
[08:56:28] <shoky> uh also i believe your code is totally asking for sql injection..
[08:56:47] <Themediator> imacange: Have you tried a simple print statement to make sure the PHP statement is pulling the right data?
[08:56:56] <imacange> Yes, it would be in a local network
[08:57:23] <imacange> http://localhost/search.php?term=aa it gives me a proper json
[08:58:04] <Themediator> So if you just print the json object contents, it gives you the desired database entries?
[08:58:12] <imacange> I verified it with http://jsonlint.com/ just to be sure
[08:58:35] <shoky> imacange: check your network tab when you're writing in the field, is it making requests to search.php ?
[08:59:17] <imacange> yes, it gives me something like this: [ "AAG, CHAN", "AAG KI", "AAGA, MAE", "AAG, ME", "AAGAARD, SOFIE", "AAP, JOR", "AAR, E ", "AAR, HEIDI ", "AAS, D ", "AAS, VICTORIA M " ]
[08:59:46] <imacange> Yes shoky, and it's not correct? it should not make request to search.php?
[09:00:12] <shoky> it should
[09:00:35] <Themediator> imacange: try storing the value from search.php as a variable, and using that as the source
[09:00:48] <imacange> hmmm... good point. let me try that
[09:01:30] <Themediator> shoky: if the json object will print fine, his PHP is alright
[09:03:49] <Themediator> imacange: I also see a problem in that you are trying to query the server after every letter they type, is that correct?
[09:05:41] <imacange> that's correct
[09:05:57] <imacange> that's what I am trying to do
[09:07:01] <Themediator> The way I have been doing it is to send the entire database at once in the beginning, store it as an object, and use that as the source
[09:07:20] <imacange> but would it not be too slow to do it that way?
[09:07:28] <imacange> then the user will have to load the whole database
[09:07:30] <Themediator> I would think it would be faster
[09:07:38] <shoky> totally depends on the amount of data
[09:07:43] <Themediator> ^
[09:07:53] <Themediator> If its just a few hundred entries, it will work fine
[09:08:04] <imacange> I have 75,000 names
[09:09:10] <Themediator> why would you want to use autocomplete for 75,000 names?
[09:09:15] <shoky> if you can get your site online with a live link we'll take a look.. hard to help much further without more info or seeing it ourselves
[09:09:29] <imacange> ok, let me explain you what I am trying to solve
[09:09:52] <imacange> I am creating a simple "input" form where my staff can update the status of our various customers
[09:09:54] <shoky> you're trying to make an autocmplete field,  what's there to explain :)
[09:10:46] <imacange> I first tried to create it with a datalist, something like: <datalist id="NAMES"> while ($row = odbc_fetch_array($res)) {print("<option value='".$row['NAME']."'>");}</datalist>
[09:10:56] <imacange> but then it takes 35s to load all the names
[09:11:11] <imacange> so I figured that I should use the jquery widget to make it faster but I don't manage to make it work
[09:11:37] <shoky> can you get the site online? give us a link?
[09:12:51] <imacange> ok, let me look for php/sql fiddle
[09:13:15] <shoky> uh dont think there's a php fiddle ;p  though who knows
[09:13:39] <gingitsu1e> Is it possible to rename a file input field?
[09:14:13] <gingitsu1e> If I do I don't recieve the files. On the server end
[09:14:48] <gingitsu1e> Seems chrome is stripping it out
[09:15:04] <Themediator> gingitsu1e: you have to update your server to look for that fields name instead
[09:15:05] <gingitsu1e> Is there a way to clone a file input and rename the file at the same time?
[09:15:18] <Themediator> what kind of back end does your server use?
[09:15:31] <gingitsu1e> weurkzeug
[09:15:38] <gingitsu1e> python
[09:15:55] <Themediator> I only know django, so I can't help with much of the specifics
[09:16:18] <gingitsu1e> What I'm getting from you is that it should be possible?
[09:16:42] <Themediator> totally. I just got done doing the same thing with a text input field
[09:16:46] <shoky> i don't think you're talking about the same thing..
[09:17:22] <shoky> gingitsu1e you want to rename the file name yeah? not the file <input>'s name attribute ?
[09:17:49] <gingitsu1e> shoky: No, i actually want to rename the input field
[09:18:15] <gingitsu1e> I'm working with a allready established controller
[09:18:22] <gingitsu1e> like the name attribute
[09:18:25] <shoky> <gingitsu1e> Is there a way to clone a file input and rename the file at the same time?      not sure what you mean here then
[09:18:44] <gingitsu1e> Maybe not at the same time
[09:18:50] <shoky> why clone?
[09:19:11] <gingitsu1e> I'm making a form where a user can upload multiple files
[09:19:19] <gingitsu1e> and there are X boxes next to the files
[09:19:31] <Themediator> gingitsu1e: in django, most inputs are controlled using forms. The cleaned input (what the server eventually gets) is usually tailored to fit the parameters the form was instantiated with
[09:20:09] <gingitsu1e> Whenever a user selects a file, i clone the origin input field put the old in in the dom with a cross next to it
[09:21:12] <Themediator> I know to do it in django, you have to switch to use a formset, or mess with the POST data yourself
[09:22:14] <Themediator> gingitsu1e: only the last input of that name will be sent with POST. You can use javascript to rename the input fields as they're generated (input1, input2 input3, etc) then they should all send data with post
[09:23:45] <Themediator> The jquery attr() method should work for renaming the input
[09:24:27] <shoky> gingitsu1e: seems to work fine  https://jsfiddle.net/go0km7e7/2/
[09:24:53] <Themediator> shoky: he is saying he isn't getting the data after submission
[09:25:20] <shoky> Themediator: he is saying that chrome is stripping it out, and you can see in the fiddle that it's not
[09:25:33] <shoky> if you submit the form and look at the network tab
[09:26:47] <gingitsu1e> shoky could be right. Until now i did rename the fields by hand
[09:27:29] <Themediator> Chrome shouldn't be stripping out anything. If you are losing the data, it's because your backend is most likely cleaning the POST data
[09:38:15] <gingitsu1e> Success, thank you kindly
[09:38:49] <gingitsu1e> If you do edit the webpage source by hand chrome strips out the changed names data :/
[09:39:09] <gingitsu1e> Doing programmaticly with js doesn't have this effect
[09:39:27] <gingitsu1e> its wotrh noting that I was renaming a input field with its value allready set
[09:39:53] <imacange> @shoky I unfortunately have no way to put my site online. I found some php type fiddle (http://ideone.com/) but I can't connect it to my database which is on an offline server.
[09:40:54] <imacange> Would this fiddle be enough for you to have an idea of what could be the problem? https://jsfiddle.net/go0km7e7/1/
[09:42:59] <safinn> I can't seem to work out why my animation changes speed when i stop it then start it again by hovering to stop it. Here is what I have: http://codepen.io/Safinn/pen/qNpdAO?editors=1010 When moving the mouse away, I want it to carry on as it was as the saem speed.
[09:47:13] <shoky> imacange: nope sorry. btw you're missing jquery-ui's css
[09:51:19] <imacange> @shoky: well alright. tks anyway. And yes, I have the jquery-ui css in my original file. I have also checked the network and when a user types in the input file, it loads search.php?=...
[09:51:31] <imacange> so I believe the problem has to do with the search.php file not the test.php
[09:51:49] <imacange> @shoky: well alright. tks anyway. And yes, I have the jquery-ui css in my original file. I have also checked the network and when a user types in the input file, it loads search.php?term=...
[09:52:38] <shoky> screenshot of that might give a clue, no idea ;)
[09:52:50] <imacange> ah yes, this I can do ;)
[09:53:42] <shoky> also.. i assume no errors in js console?
[09:57:08] <imacange> nop, no errors
[10:04:25] <imacange> Alright here is my screenshot: https://postimg.org/image/rjh0bx4nr/
[10:04:45] <imacange> @shoky: tell me what you think
[10:06:23] <shoky> imacange: that doesn't show the response from search.php though
[10:06:33] <imacange> no, that's the freaking problem
[10:06:58] <shoky> imacange: i mean in the network tab
[10:07:29] <imacange> oh... good point. No idea why that is but you're right it should logically show something
[10:08:05] <shoky> imacange: in the screenshot you are not showing it, you need to select that row and show the response body
[10:08:34] <shoky> btw you're still not returning a json content-type  (but that's not the problem)
[10:10:54] <imacange> ok, I am uploading the screenshot of the response
[10:14:36] <imacange> Here it is https://s31.postimg.org/h2iz9qszf/screenshot.jpg
[10:15:13] <shoky> imacange: that looks like the same one
[10:15:53] <imacange> sorry, here it is: https://s32.postimg.org/3pzjook05/screenshot.jpg
[10:16:00] <imacange> pffiouuu, tks for your patience :p
[10:16:37] <shoky> imacange: now show the actual response body (click Response tab on the top-right)
[10:18:02] <imacange> Shoky I love you!!!
[10:18:03] <imacange> It works
[10:18:10] <imacange> by clicking response I found the obvious bug
[10:18:13] <imacange> by clicking response I found the obvious bog
[10:18:30] <shoky> :)
[10:18:34] <Ahiiru> computers are wondrous things
[10:18:50] <imacange> I had a stupid comma too much
[10:19:15] <shoky> you should always check the actual data that the browser is receiving
[10:20:14] <imacange> Yep... I definitely learned the lesson. I've been two days full time on that thing. First to handle the encoding of cyrillic letters in the json and then now to remove that simple comma
[10:20:25] <shoky> where did the comma come from btw
[10:20:45] <imacange> it was outside of the <?php php>,
[10:20:56] <shoky> ah
[10:21:03] <imacange> ?>,
[10:21:10] <shoky> weird that you didn't get a json error then in the console..
[10:21:14] <imacange> yes... daahh
[10:21:28] <imacange> yes, really weird actually
[10:21:31] <imacange> anyway, tks so much
[10:21:41] <shoky> oh actually not weird, since you're using the shortcut "source" option
[10:21:49] <shoky> and not doing the ajax yourself, with error handler
[10:22:02] <shoky> np
[10:22:30] <imacange> oh... well... as I said at the beginning, I've never used jquery first and I am just getting started. In fact I start to learn php 3 weeks ago
[10:22:50] <shoky> well you should learn about sql injection
[10:22:59] <shoky> because your php code is asking for it. very insecure
[10:23:35] <imacange> lol, yes. You mentioned that at the beginning. Could you recommend me to modify something in my code or would it be too complicated?
[10:24:13] <shoky> i don't really know php
[10:24:25] <shoky> http://php.net/manual/en/security.database.sql-injection.php   seems a good start ;p
[10:24:29] <imacange> I know that if someone writes search.php?term=drop table it would most likely erase my table
[10:24:45] <imacange> cool, tks for the tip
[10:24:48] <shoky> well they'd have to be a little more trickier than just "drop table" but yeah that's the gist
[10:24:55] <sharpy35> hey guys i am trying to format a date with daterangepicker but i am always getting Invalid Date with that format string: DD.MM.YYYY, HH:mm:ss  i am sitting here since 8 hours trying to figure out why
[10:25:01] <sharpy35> but i cant get it to work
[10:26:06] <shoky> imacange: really you should be using parametrised queries (prepared statements) http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php
[10:30:30] <imacange> ok shoky, I am looking at it
[11:10:10] <kegster> when using .on(), i understand sometimes you need to use $('tbody').on('click', 'tr', function()) --- in case an element gets added to the DOM after page loaded. How do I handle keypress on an element with the same scenario?
[11:11:01] <shoky> kegster: same
[11:11:12] <kegster> on supports 'keypress' ?
[11:11:20] <kegster> i read it doesn't. i suppose i should have just tried it ;P
[11:11:31] <cannap> .on('eventname')
[11:11:34] <shoky> on supports any event. and events that bubble can be used in delegation
[11:11:39] <shoky> and keypress bubbles
[11:12:49] <kegster> well then. i must have read a dated or incorrect article
[11:12:51] <kegster> thak you :D
[11:13:42] <kegster> does the first selector need to be an element created with pageload?
[11:15:13] <shoky> it needs to be an element that exists in the DOM at the time you run the query
[11:17:01] <kegster> ahh ok so when using 2 selectors in .on(), either can exist in the DOM at the time of running--- but if you use .on() with one selector, it won't?
[11:17:14] <shoky> hm?
[11:17:30] <shoky> $('tbody')   looks for all <tbody> that exist now in the DOM
[11:18:54] <shoky> .on('click', '.foo', .. )     attaches an event handler to the element(s) you ran it on ( <tbody> in our example),   that listens for click events coming from descendant .foo elements (that may or may not exist currently)
[11:19:45] <shoky> so anything in the $(...)   needs to exist already
[11:19:53] <shoky> nothing to do with .on() though
[12:00:15] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeee
[12:01:14] <kegster> shoky, ok i think that makes sense. sorry i was reading up on a couple things with that
[12:01:17] <kegster> thank you :)
[14:20:08] <hamdjan> hi which rangeslider do you recommend? i tried ioden rangeslider unsuccesfully. jquery's built rangeslider worked but jquery.css messed up my whole site layout. not sure whats the best way to go
[14:23:37] <robertmaxrees> you mean the jquery ui one?
[14:23:50] <robertmaxrees> i've used nouislider with some success in the past.
[14:24:07] <robertmaxrees> but when you said "unsuccessfully", what do you mean hamdjan?
[14:24:08] <hamdjan> yep jquery ui slider
[14:24:28] <hamdjan> robertmaxrees, no slider appears, just a text input field
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> then lets fix that problem :)
[14:24:39] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:24:43] <hamdjan> let me check
[14:25:29] <hamdjan> oh ye a couple
[14:25:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:26:47] <hamdjan> http://sprunge.us/IQRi
[14:27:05] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're including the file before jquery.
[14:27:12] <robertmaxrees> make sure jquery is included, then the plugin.
[14:31:55] <hamdjan> yep the console errors are gone now by putting jquery priorly. now there is no input field anymore but no slider either, just four slider values "100    300    800    1000"
[14:34:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[14:34:41] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're doing something incorrectly :)
[14:39:24] <hamdjan> i used this fiddle as template http://jsfiddle.net/Lh6aoaep/ and now i looked again thoroughly in the external imports and saw that i imported skinFlat instead of skinHTML5. now it works :)
[14:39:35] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[14:39:35] <hamdjan> thanks
[15:24:51] <nedbat> not sure if this is the right channel for qunit questions: I have a qunit page with many passing tests, and I cannot scroll down to the end.  It insists on staying scrolled to the top. Is this common? Am I doing something wrong?
[15:28:29] <nedbat> weird: for some reason, after some period of waiting, it scrolls just fine.
[15:28:45] <robertmaxrees> maybe you have to wait for the tests to finish?
[15:35:39] <nedbat> robertmaxrees: hmm, no, it says "253 assertions of 253 passed, 0 failed." almost immediately, but takes a minute or so before the scrolling works.
[15:36:04] <robertmaxrees> dunno though. maybe crack open the profiler and see?
[15:37:23] <nedbat> robertmaxrees: i'm not sure i care *that* much :)
[15:38:20] <robertmaxrees> Hah.
[20:10:09] <fission6> how can i see what a specific file looke dlike befoer a commmit
[20:10:20] <robertmaxrees> Hrm?
[20:10:23] <robertmaxrees> you mean with git?
[20:11:50] <robertmaxrees> fission6
