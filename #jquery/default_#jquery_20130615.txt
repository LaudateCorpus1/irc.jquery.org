[00:01:14] <tw2113> yo mydog2
[00:02:16] <tw2113> i'm highly suspect of this aa.html file of yours mydog2
[00:03:02] <mydog2> hey..
[00:03:09] <mydog2> sorry.. thought i was typing here!!
[00:03:16] <tw2113> now you are
[00:03:17] <tw2113> yay
[00:03:18] <mydog2> need sleep!
[00:03:35] <mydog2> let me paste the aa.html..
[00:03:37] <tw2113> now, i'm doubtful that WordPress is loading jQuery in aa.html
[00:03:43] <tw2113> because it's not a php file
[00:04:28] <mydog2> http://pastebin.com/Bz3UWvAa  <<
[00:05:06] <Gluesticky> How do you get the raw contents of an iframe?
[00:05:13] <mydog2> tw2113,  - i thought i could simply include the jquery lib as a js file...
[00:05:30] <cr117> mydog2: try wrapping it in head tags
[00:05:46] <tw2113> aha
[00:05:54] <tw2113> yeah, you're manually including the copy that WP provides
[00:06:03] <tw2113> but that doesn't mean WP is loading it
[00:06:13] <tw2113> also what cr117 said
[00:06:17] <tw2113> get a head tag in there
[00:06:19] <Eviltwin> mydog2: Improved: http://pastebin.com/Z6H5yXPG
[00:06:36] <mydog2> tw2113, - umm.. just the src/include.. or do you want me to try doing the script inside the head as well
[00:06:51] <tw2113> anything with a <script>
[00:07:24] <tw2113> also check your console for js errors
[00:08:17] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - still didn't work
[00:09:02] <Eviltwin> mydog2: Try this out instead: http://pastebin.com/sqHrzn2i
[00:09:03] <uuno> when i do this.arr[this.index]=this.tmparr; where tmparr is an array and then i later do wrk.tmparr.length=0; it seems to clear the this.arr too, why?
[00:09:58] <tw2113> mydog2, http://jsfiddle.net/f5Gjz/
[00:10:05] <mydog2> tw2113,  - in the debugger.. it's as if the click(function)... is never called.. the breakpoint is never triggered
[00:10:07] <uuno> if i add an array to an array is it a reference?
[00:11:28] <uuno> any idea?
[00:12:37] <sacho> you could call it that, yes
[00:12:42] <Eviltwin> uuno: Objects, of which arrays are a subclass, are passed by reference
[00:13:31] <uuno> Eviltwin, so when i clear the tmparr it gets cleared whereever i have placed it?
[00:13:34] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - nope.. implemented your paste - sad to say.. the $(".test1").click(function ()  is never triggered... i have a break set there.. it never gets invoked
[00:13:47] <Eviltwin> uuno: Yes, unless you copy it
[00:13:52] <tw2113> mydog2, i just had it working, i clicked a radio button 2 disappeared
[00:14:00] <uuno> is there some command to pass it as a copy?
[00:14:21] <Eviltwin> uuno: No, but you can make a copy of it and pass that copy by reference
[00:14:30] <mydog2> tw2113,  - is that in the jsfiddle.. or on your test site..
[00:14:37] <tw2113> jsfiddle
[00:14:46] <uuno> howto make a copy of an array?
[00:14:55] <Eviltwin> uuno: The easiest way is to call .slice(0) on it
[00:14:55] <mydog2> in fiddle.. i get it working.. but it's something on my test that's not working
[00:15:01] <tw2113> i never had it working in YOUR fiddle
[00:15:14] <uuno> ok, thanks i try that
[00:15:19] <tw2113> jQuery file isn't 404ing is it?
[00:15:34] <uuno> btw, why has javascript channel went to register only?
[00:15:39] <tw2113> oh yeah, my fiddle had the revised version from Evilt
[00:15:43] <tw2113> Eviltwin,
[00:17:58] <mydog2> tw2113, i can load the js file from the url..
[00:18:09] <tw2113> i realize you can type it in
[00:18:20] <tw2113> i mean in the browser on your localhost, does it show a minified jquery
[00:18:23] <tw2113> or does it say 404
[00:18:31] <tw2113> when you visit the url directly
[00:19:04] <mydog2> tw2113,  = it shows /*! jQuery v1.8.3 jquery.com | jquery.org/license */ .....
[00:19:14] <tw2113> just double checking all corners
[00:19:23] <mydog2> so it's resolving the url pointing to the js file..
[00:19:27] <mydog2> no prob..
[00:19:43] <mydog2> so you see my issue!!
[00:19:58] <mydog2> i've created a really basic test to run/invoke jquery..
[00:20:07] <mydog2> and something is hanging up..
[00:57:35] <okdamn> hey why i'm unable to clear the interval like this? http://pastebin.com/AzV04vWN
[00:57:36] <okdamn> :O
[00:58:19] <Eviltwin> okdamn: It's a funciton, not a method
[00:58:26] <Eviltwin> clearInterval(time), not time.clearInterval()
[00:58:46] <okdamn> oh gosh thanks dudes
[00:58:48] <okdamn> :P
[00:59:09] <tw2113> Eviltwin, he thinks you're a split personality
[00:59:29] <tw2113> good to hear mydog2
[01:28:20] <alaing> morning
[01:28:26] <alaing> why so quiet in this room
[01:32:57] <tw2113> it's 3:30am for me
[01:33:46] <alaing> lol
[01:34:03] <alaing> anyone here a scss expert?
[01:34:12] <alaing> how do I get border-left and border right to share the same color? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EbaBn
[01:34:39] <alaing> I asked in #sass ,#css but the channels are quiet too
[01:35:46] <tw2113> are you able to break up your css property selectors like that in sass now?
[01:36:00] <tw2113> border: {}
[01:36:07] <tw2113> and then in the {} you have all the border based properties
[01:37:44] <alaing> I dont think so...
[01:38:42] <tw2113> well i know there's border-color, border-width, border-style etc
[01:38:44] <alaing> sorry it should have been right and bottom
[01:39:16] <alaing> This seems to work http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vCoxb but seems a ashame to repeat the color http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vCoxb
[01:39:31] <alaing> lines 13 to 18

[01:57:26] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/w9xND/ can i get a hand with syntax
[02:03:10] <alaing> unnu: i'm having a look
[02:03:24] <unnu> man, i can't even get it to alert O.o
[02:04:00] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/w9xND/4/
[02:05:17] <alaing> noticed that
[02:05:39] <Eviltwin> unnu: These are <input>s not <button>s
[02:05:50] <Eviltwin> You want input.delete_photo
[02:06:12] <unnu> duhhhh
[02:06:14] <alaing> I was just about to say that :-D
[02:06:14] <unnu> lol
[02:06:28] <alaing> or :button
[02:06:30] <unnu> how do i grab the number 2 then?
[02:07:45] <unnu> because that is giving me undefined
[02:07:50] <alaing> http://jsfiddle.net/w9xND/7/
[02:08:04] <unnu> okay
[02:08:12] <alaing> closest goes up the dom
[02:08:51] <alaing> you could of used .next http://jsfiddle.net/w9xND/8/
[02:09:15] <alaing> although using .next would break if you changed the structure of the html and something else was next
[02:09:21] <Eviltwin> As long as it's the element that immediately follows, yes
[03:06:26] <DukeDrake> hi
[03:07:02] <DukeDrake> is it possible to  access the absolute horizontal offset for an element, like pageX for an event?
[03:12:09] <sahbeewah> DukeDrake, .offset()
[03:27:39] <DukeDrake> sahbeewah: thanx! =)
[04:22:43] <DukeDrake> how can I click and drag an element?
[04:23:15] <DukeDrake> i.e. how does the mousedown, mousemove, mouseup thing work?
[04:27:54] <alaing> DukeDrake: are you using jquery ui?
[04:28:49] <alaing> DukeDrake: those are events but you need to change the styling of the element to remove it from the normal flow of the page
[04:29:02] <alaing> jQuery UI has a drag an drop api
[04:29:50] <alaing> http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[04:30:02] <alaing> http://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[04:32:40] <malorie> how can I map over a jquery object such that I can access the contained elements?
[04:34:20] <DukeDrake> no
[04:34:37] <DukeDrake> I don't need a plugin for a simple mousedown, mousmove, mouseup thingy ^^
[04:44:15] <DukeDrake> although it doesn't work too well yet >.>
[04:46:26] <DukeDrake> i.e. I'd like to drag an image around, but it shows the browser icon for "can't drop here"

[05:37:48] <horacsio> how to?
[06:38:24] <Ungy> Quick Question I have three radio buttons all with eh same class I am delgating on that class but only the first radio button seems to get teh delegated click. do I need to do an each or somethign to delegate to all classes?
[06:39:51] <joesavage> Which I use ".click" or "bind('click', .." on a certain selector, and then later AJAX in some new HTML content to the page, the events previously defined don't apply to this newly added content. How can I fix this?
[06:41:01] <Ungy> joesavage you need to use delegate or use on
[06:43:32] <geoffb> A question about using jquery/firequery/firebug to fiddle with an existing web site, if I may. URL is this: <http://dicksmith.com.au/product/XC8141/blahblah.jsp>. Clicking the "check store stock" button executes setSkuId(), submits a hidden form, causes the page to reload with a floating div/form over the top of it. I'd like to then script setting a 'postcode' value and submitting that form, but jquery and javascript insist that el
[06:45:16] <Ungy> geoffb you going to continue that statement
[06:45:39] <joesavage> Ungy: "on" is working great, thanks!
[06:45:43] <geoffb> Ungy no, that's it. tried to get it all in one line (possibly went a bit overboard).
[06:46:05] <sahbeewah> Ungy, post some code?
[06:48:46] <Ungy> sahbeewah if ($('.addaccount').length) { $('form').delegate(".addaccount", "click", function (e) { var curValue = $(this).val(); }); } I have three radio buttons with .addaccount class on them the event only fires once
[06:53:36] <Ungy> so I switched it to on instead of delegate and still the same problem ;-(
[06:58:02] <Ungy> aha I am an idiot
[06:58:20] <Ungy> I was modifying the current Value on teh radio button which broke it

[07:21:10] <RandalSchwartz> $('#table tr td:odd')
[07:21:19] <RandalSchwartz> oops.. $('#table tr:odd')
[07:21:21] <RandalSchwartz> odd rows
[07:21:27] <RandalSchwartz> or :even for even
[07:22:03] <RandalSchwartz> if you have nested tables, that breaks down a bit.
[07:24:09] <RandalSchwartz> samsoft?
[07:27:07] <samsoft> Thanks RandalSchwartz, i have done that but its not working.. let me screen short it to you ... Thanks!
[07:28:17] <RandalSchwartz> drop something into jsfiddle
[07:28:27] <RandalSchwartz> that way I can play with it to make it work. :)
[07:29:19] <RandalSchwartz> much harder to interact with screenshots

[07:35:11] <v0lksman> hello all!  anyone have any suggestions for a simple color picker?  I need to let my users pick some colors!
[07:37:02] <samsoft> RandalSchwartz, i want to give a background color to two table rows and the next two rows will have another backgroud color, alternate like that.. here is the link http://d.pr/i/Gjiq
[07:37:25] <RandalSchwartz> oh two by two, not 1 by 1
[07:37:31] <RandalSchwartz> yeah... even odd won't do that
[07:37:35] <RandalSchwartz> you have to do some math :)
[07:38:08] <RandalSchwartz> Why do you want to do 2/2 rather than 1/1
[07:39:21] <samsoft> You can view the screen shot, all because of the site presentation.... if i use 1/1, i will not be able to present it the way it suppose to be
[07:40:42] <RandalSchwartz> ok - let me work on it for a second
[07:40:56] <samsoft> check the link, the tr have the class attribute call tablerow, just to distinguished them from the other tr
[07:48:52] <RandalSchwartz> samsoft - see http://jsfiddle.net/AXh3n/
[07:50:34] <RandalSchwartz> and for you, it'd be $('.tablerow').each() then
[07:52:52] <samsoft> Thanks RandalSchwartz.. trying to open the URL now.
[07:58:10] <RandalSchwartz> does that do what you want?
[07:59:34] <samsoft> Thanks RandalSchwartz, trying to apply it... i am using smarty platform
[08:02:36] <RandalSchwartz> oh - if your table is generated by smarty, just do that same math in PHP
[08:02:40] <RandalSchwartz> no need for jquery
[08:03:13] <RandalSchwartz> increment a counter for each time you generate "tablerow", and if counter % 4 > 1, flip the class
[08:03:41] <malorie> I'm drowing a font-face text to my canvas, but on the first draw the font isn't loaded yet, so nothing happens. how can I preload font-faces?
[08:06:39] <RandalSchwartz> in your head... <link rel="prefetch" href="pathto/font">
[08:06:43] <RandalSchwartz> got that from googling
[08:06:46] <RandalSchwartz> not personally tried
[08:07:28] <RandalSchwartz> more tutorial - http://www.toxzen.co.za/tutorials/item/39-mastering-html5-prefetching
[08:08:39] <dangerousdave> Hello, I have just implented this http://stackoverflow.com/a/17075389/261184 and it does the trick, however it stops my lightbox links from working, any ideas on how to fix please?
[08:11:26] <jedimind> dangerousdave:  change the $('a') selector so that it doesn't grab your lightbox anchors
[08:11:50] <malorie> RandalSchwartz: so if I prefetch a dummy page that has the required font-faces in use I should be good?
[08:12:09] <RandalSchwartz> no - prefetch the font itself
[08:12:18] <RandalSchwartz> at least that's what I'm seeing
[08:12:27] <RandalSchwartz> <link rel="prefetch" href="webfont.woff">
[08:12:32] <malorie> oh, I see
[08:12:39] <malorie> I'll try that. thanks
[08:12:45] <RandalSchwartz> again - just googling
[08:12:48] <RandalSchwartz> no personal knowledge
[08:13:03] <RandalSchwartz> oddly enough, my client wants me to optimize some pages this morning
[08:13:11] <RandalSchwartz> so I am thinking about this stuff already
[08:13:16] <malorie> :-)
[08:13:29] <RandalSchwartz> and in googling for you, I cam across a few other tips
[08:13:36] <RandalSchwartz> this page looks smart - http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/front-end-performance-for-web-designers-and-front-end-developers/
[08:16:07] <samsoft> RandalSchwartz.. thank you but i can't find anything relate to what we are discussing...

[08:31:21] <RandalSchwartz> yes hi
[08:31:38] <RandalSchwartz> samsoft - those urls were for malorie
[08:31:58] <RandalSchwartz> but did you understand the parts about using smarty and avoiding jquery altogether?
[08:33:11] <samsoft> RandalSchwartz, not full, but i do i alternate the row in smarty
[08:33:50] <samsoft> boytoy thanks, Appreciate!
[08:37:03] <RandalSchwartz> samsoft - same as my solution
[08:37:13] * RandalSchwartz sighs

[08:38:35] <RandalSchwartz> badpaste
[08:38:55] <RandalSchwartz> boytoy, I wrote this for samsoft earlier http://jsfiddle.net/AXh3n/
[08:39:13] <RandalSchwartz> but I said as long as he's using smarty, he can just generate the proper classes in the template instead
[08:39:18] <RandalSchwartz> using the same sort of server-side variable
[08:40:18] <boytoy> yup same one, nice RandalSchwartz
[08:41:34] <samsoft> okay, Thanks guy.. i appreciate ur assistance, googling on how i can implement the script in smarty

[08:58:57] <mydog2> hey guys.. trying to figure out how to use jquery to do a copy of a chunk of dom/html.. and be able to do a strreplace on the diff dom elements for the name attribute, and then insert the modified dom chunk in a different div within the page..  i've pasted what i'm trying to do  ... http://pastebin.com/CkzXaT9T  <<
[08:59:31] <mydog2> if i could find a pointer as how to do the str replace over the elements..
[09:09:10] <v0lksman> mydog2: https://dpaste.de/B0YH6/ <- something like that...
[09:47:04] <hayjoss> i'm trying to figure out a way to trick the jquery ui slider, i want it so that on value 0, the slider will return black (hsl(0, 0%, 0%)), and when it's at 360, it'll return white (hsl(360, 100%, 100%)) - here's a fiddle of the slider, http://jsfiddle.net/anpsmn/t2PDc/10/ - can't seem to figure it out
[09:47:28] <hayjoss> i want all the other colors to return as normal though
[09:49:06] <mydog2> v0lksman, - just saw the msg.. looking now..
[10:02:48] <_gourab> hi
[10:03:50] <_gourab> can any one tell me how to put a  ajax() in an iteration?
[10:04:18] <_gourab> i have been doing this and it works only once.
[10:04:27] <RandalSchwartz> you mean to fire off a whole bunch of them?
[10:04:34] <RandalSchwartz> you understand what "async" means, right?
[10:04:50] <RandalSchwartz> you can't use the results of them until they come back
[10:05:03] <RandalSchwartz> ahh... and there's also a limit of how many you can have live at a time
[10:05:08] <RandalSchwartz> I think it's 4
[10:05:26] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: ya i know this async. How how to do it?
[10:05:37] <RandalSchwartz> jsfiddle.com with your code
[10:05:49] <RandalSchwartz> or at least what you're trying so far
[10:05:59] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: can i give you a pastebin link.
[10:06:30] <RandalSchwartz> sure, but jsfiddle lets me fiddle with it :)
[10:06:32] <bwen> is there a way to bind on an event and make sure its the first one to be executed? .unshiftBind('eventName', function (){}) or something....
[10:06:37] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: http://pastebin.com/wDZKDVmd
[10:07:10] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: i will give you a jsfiddle one
[10:07:21] <RandalSchwartz> wait... why is your while loop around the outside of document ready?
[10:07:26] <RandalSchwartz> I think you should fix that first
[10:08:35] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: Actuallu i am trying to fetch the text from http://hib.ximb.ac.in/Hibiscus/Pub/nbDocDet.php?docid=4123&client=iiit&iframe=true
[10:09:08] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: an changing the post number in this case 4123 gives me different post
[10:10:30] <RandalSchwartz> sure.  fix what I said first.
[10:10:41] <RandalSchwartz> otherwise, you're probably channging the i value for all fetches at the same time
[10:10:48] <RandalSchwartz> since it's not properly inside the closure
[10:12:56] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: i couldn't understand if remove the loop then how can i fetch every post in http://intranet.iiit-bh.ac.in/
[10:14:04] <RandalSchwartz> Put the loop INSIDE the doc-ready
[10:14:25] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: let me try
[10:14:41] <RandalSchwartz> and even then, you might need to copy var j = 1 inside your ajax
[10:14:45] <RandalSchwartz> var j = i
[10:15:08] <RandalSchwartz> because you have to have it be a closure variable for each iteration of your loop
[10:21:18] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: Sorry sir. i did put loop inside doc-ready but it didn' work.Could you please edit the code:https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-4l_sJ3z8VtQTBVQ2Y1ZUc2bEE/edit?usp=sharing
[10:21:53] <RandalSchwartz> Can you please put that on jsfiddle now? :(
[10:30:14] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: Sorry the previous Code was nor working in my desktop.but is js fiddle its working. i dont know why?i http://jsfiddle.net/Gourab/5H7HD/
[10:30:48] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: its is still not working in my desktop.Exactly same cose
[10:36:47] <RandalSchwartz> I now refuse to help you.   I keep saying MOVE YOUR LOOP INSIDE YOUR DOCREADY.  You have not yet done that.  You get no more of my time.
[10:40:40] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: Sir what i had sent you was the code previous to your siggestion.i had told you that your suggestion did worked in jsfiddle.
[10:41:37] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: Sorry sir i did that and now it works in JSfiddle but i told you it didn't worked in my desktop.
[10:43:35] <BillTheButcher> question: whats the best way to recognize a link click? I want to alter the attribute of another element if the link is clicked.
[10:43:58] <BillTheButcher> figured I could add an id to the link but can't I use the href attr?
[10:46:29] <BillTheButcher> an li with id is preceding the link
[10:46:34] <BillTheButcher> a li*
[10:48:24] <_gourab> RandalSchwartz: Sorry sir i did what you said but send you the wrong code
[10:55:49] <mydog2> " . " -> for class   / " # " -> for ID / umm what's for name ???
[10:56:43] <grafi> [name="xyz"]
[10:58:22] <mydog2> grafi.. oh.. so there's no shortcut/selector as there is for class/id..
[10:58:37] <grafi> not that i've ever heard of
[10:58:43] <mydog2> ok.. thanks.
[10:58:53] <grafi> of course that doesn't neccessarily mean anything ;)
[11:01:25] <v0lksman> anyone know if you need to have the map initialized for spherical computations to work?  (Google mapps v3)
[11:01:39] <v0lksman> I have a polygon object but can't seem to get the area of it
[11:04:36] <true_techie> how can i keep the aspect ratio of images using masonry?
[11:08:52] <Pavlov> whats the best way to reload images on network error?
[11:11:47] <Pavlov> onerror catch them I guess?
[11:11:53] <Pavlov> is probably better than completed
[11:29:12] <malorie> is there a jquery plugin, or something, to break a string down into lines of maximum n characters?
[11:50:30] <Wescotte> I'm having problems recreating a POST request and not sure what I'm doing wrong. http://pastebin.ca/2399687 <--- Here is the expected format of the POST and my source. Any ideas?
[12:03:24] <RandomCouch> Is anyone available to help me out?
[12:03:47] <RandomCouch> I think I have a relatively easy problem to solve if you're an intermediate
[12:04:41] <RandomCouch> I'm trying to make an ajax call to get jsonp object, but it's not working. It keeps giving me status code: 0
[12:04:53] <RandomCouch> is this because the server I'm contacting doesn't support jsonp
[12:04:59] <RandomCouch> this is my ajax call http://pastebin.com/w1iAzD46
[12:34:04] <dangerousdave> Is there an overhead when doing $('li#contact') multiple times? should I assign to a variable? thanks
[12:39:04] <hugo_moss> i have a problem where im debugging code that adds a class that does a css animation, when i debug that code and step through it, once i hit the part that animates, it steps into jquery but the jquery file is empty, and the debugger freezes
[12:39:24] <alaing> dangerousdave: why not just use $('#contact')
[12:39:54] <alaing> dangerousdave: you should only have one element with the id of #contact on the page
[12:40:02] <dangerousdave> alaing: as i mighht use tht atribute on a different element
[12:40:18] <dangerousdave> alaing: sorry, i meant .
[12:40:22] <alaing> dangerousdave: I personally would have used classes
[12:40:44] <dangerousdave> alaing: yes, agreed
[12:41:12] <alaing> are you likely to have other elements apart from li that have a class of .contact?
[12:41:41] <dangerousdave> alaing: note likely, but possible
[12:41:46] <dangerousdave> not ^
[12:42:59] <alaing> dangerousdave: if you going to use $('li.contact') in multiple places in your code it is good practice to cache the selector in a variable
[12:43:16] <dangerousdave> alaing: ok, thanks for help
[12:43:42] <alaing> because everytime you use  $('li.contact') all that jquery goodness has to work through the DOM to find the elements again
[12:45:38] <Wescotte> I'm having problems recreating a POST request and not sure what I'm doing wrong. http://pastebin.ca/2399687 <--- Here is the expected format of the POST and my source. Any ideas?
[12:48:14] <RandalSchwartz> I'm upgrading from jquery ui 1.7 to 1.10, and I'm seeing subtle differences in the font sizes in my widget contents
[12:48:45] <alaing> Wescotte: can you knock up a jsfiddle example
[12:49:19] <alaing> RandalSchwartz: yeah I spotted that as well.
[12:49:38] <Wescotte> alaing: unfortunately I can't... It requires a oauth2 in order to process the request.
[12:50:25] <RandalSchwartz> .ui-widget { font-size: 1.1em }
[12:50:30] <RandalSchwartz> I think that's the culprit
[12:51:33] <Wescotte> alaing: the top part is the POST request expected for what I'm attempting to do according ot Google's dev docs. I just am not sure how to construct it in code. The sample code in that block returns "success" but it creates a file (not a folder) called "Untitled" instead of the name I specify and it's not creating it where I tell it to but intead is created in the root dir.
[12:52:11] <RandalSchwartz> I forget... if I pull in jquery css, then have my own *after* that, does the last one win?
[12:52:46] <alaing> Wescotte: sorry I dont have any experience or knowledge about google drive
[12:53:43] <alaing> RandalSchwartz: depends on the styles in the files but you can overwrite jquery ui font size
[12:53:45] <Wescotte> alaing: I just need to know how to properly encode the POST request using ajax()... I think I'm perhaps putting the arguments in the wrong order/format or something.
[12:54:47] <alaing> Wescotte: I'm not sure if you can use jQuery ajax across domains.....security reasons
[12:55:40] <Wescotte> alaing: it's working for other Google api. I've been using it for Google Fusion tables just fine.
[12:56:54] <morteza> hi
[12:57:07] <morteza> when I use removeAttr , then I can make that attr again
[12:57:36] <alaing> Wescotte: what version of jquery are you using
[12:57:41] <morteza> for example when I remove checked attribute from checkbox , then I can't make checked attribute for them with attr('checked','checked')
[12:57:45] <morteza> so how can I solve it?
[12:59:18] <alaing> Wescotte: are you expecting json?
[12:59:23] <Wescotte> morteza: attr('checked', '') instead of removing it I think?
[12:59:49] <Wescotte> alaing: I don't follow.. expecting as in what I'm sending or what I'm receiving?
[13:00:08] <morteza> Wescotte: I did it , but it can't work :(
[13:00:29] <alaing> Wescotte: Wescotte what you receiving
[13:00:58] <alaing> Wescotte: from "https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v2/files
[13:01:39] <Wescotte> alaing: The "success" responseText appears to be JSON yes.
[13:03:24] <alaing> Wescotte: try adding dataType : "json"
[13:04:30] <alaing> Wescotte: I've done a fair amount of post reuqest using ajax but I've not had to use the header settings
[13:05:17] <alaing> morteza: what version of jquery are you using?
[13:06:22] <alaing> morteza: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9950123/what-is-the-proper-way-to-uncheck-a-checkbox-in-jquery-1-7
[13:10:08] <morteza> alaing: I used 1.9
[13:10:17] <Wescotte> alaing: datatype: "json" doesn't appear to do anything differnet. It's just not getting those three arguments title: parents: and mimeType:
[13:10:33] <shoky> Wescotte: you want contentType: 'application/json'
[13:11:02] <shoky> Wescotte: and  data:  JSON.stringify( { mimeType:..., title:..., parents:... } )
[13:11:14] <alaing> morteza: try use .prop() instead of attr like that stackoverflow answer says
[13:11:48] <shoky> Wescotte: also notice that in your example the "parents" is an array
[13:12:32] <Wescotte> shoky: yeah noticed that and adjusted.. http://pastebin.ca/2399714 still didn't work. WIll try stringify now.
[13:13:13] <shoky> Wescotte: yeah currentyl you're not sending JSON
[13:13:41] <morteza> alaing: thanks a lot
[13:14:35] <alaing> morteza no problem I get confused sometimes about whether to use .attr or .prop
[13:15:33] <Wescotte> shoky: JSON.stringify() is a no go.
[13:15:43] <shoky> Wescotte: repaste
[13:16:21] <shoky> Wescotte: and what does no go mean exactly..
[13:19:41] <Wescotte> shoky: http://pastebin.ca/2399718 (top code section is what I just tried).. No go means it still reports "success" and Google Drive creates a file instead of a folder. It's called "Untitled" and it's created in root folder instead of where I specify according to the parent ID argument.
[13:20:07] <shoky> Wescotte: uhhh that's not what i said
[13:20:20] <shoky> you don't stringify a string
[13:20:45] <Wescotte> shoky: leave off the quotes then?
[13:20:55] <shoky> Wescotte: http://pastebin.ca/2399719
[13:22:42] <Wescotte> shoky: same result... It's producing a file instead of a folder and it's called "Untitled"
[13:23:21] <RandalSchwartz> ugh - spooky problems on safari on differences between 1.7 and 1.10, but *not* on firefox, which renders them identically
[13:23:27] <shoky> Wescotte: well your url is https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v2/files
[13:23:41] <shoky> Wescotte: oops nevermind that
[13:23:53] <RandalSchwartz> $client is insisting I run with 1.10 js and 1.7 css.
[13:23:59] <RandalSchwartz> I'm trying to talk him down from that ledge
[13:24:29] <shoky> Wescotte: what's in #address and what's PHOTO_FOLDER_ID
[13:24:36] <RandalSchwartz> maybe 1.9 won't break the same way
[13:26:42] <Wescotte> shoky: PHOTO_FOLDER_ID is a constant I assigned by pulling the ID from using the little query tool Gogole has https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/files/list#try-it and address.value is just random jibberish I've been typing into an <input type="text" id="address"/>
[13:27:19] <Wescotte> shoky: the parents argument is specifying what folder the action is to take place in. Leaving it off just results in the action taking place in the the root folder.
[13:27:57] <Wescotte> shoky: Since it's defaulting to "Untitled" and the root folder AND a file instead of mimeType I just assume it's not getting any of those values.
[13:28:43] <alaing> RandalSchwartz: why not overwrite the font size
[13:28:52] <shoky> Wescotte: but you say it's getting the "parents" argument ok
[13:29:04] <alaing> RandalSchwartz: actually have you had a play about with the themeroller?
[13:29:58] <alaing> RandalSchwartz: if you go to "Roll your own" you can specifically cant the font size
[13:30:06] <alaing> cant = change
[13:31:23] <Wescotte> shoky: http://pastebin.ca/2399720 <-- here is my console results for the request and the response
[13:33:03] <shoky> Wescotte: did you put contentType: 'application/json'
[13:39:25] <Wescotte> shoky: ops missed that. Just added and retried.. same result. Would you like an updated console log?
[13:39:42] <shoky> Wescotte: yes and include your updated code
[13:40:03] <shoky> how could you miss that :\ it's only the first thing i said, and it's in my paste
[13:41:45] <Wescotte> shoky: http://pastebin.ca/2399722
[13:42:02] <Wescotte> shoky: I only copied the stringify snippet the first time :)
[13:42:56] <Wescotte> shoky: btw thanks for all the help thus far.
[13:43:40] <Wescotte> shoky: but I have tried 'application/json' several times
[13:49:58] <shoky> Wescotte:  the example has url:  https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2/files
[13:50:11] <shoky> Wescotte: but your ajax url is:  https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v2/files
[13:50:33] <shoky> other than that the request looks fine
[13:51:24] <shoky> Wescotte: and you can definitely delete that part you commented out, you definitely don't need to put those fields outside of the "data" field
[13:53:32] <Wescotte> shoky: hah. thank you!
[13:53:47] <Wescotte> shoky: I dunno how i missed that. I rebuilt that url line several times
[13:54:01] <shoky> yer welcome
[13:55:35] <Wescotte> shoky: If it would have just gave me an error I would have probably noticed that but the strange side effect of an "untitled" file instead of a folder threw me for a loop
[13:55:52] <alaing> lol I cant believe it was the url after all that....
[13:56:01] <alaing> easy enough done though :-D
[13:56:11] <shoky> it wasn't just the url ;p
[13:56:28] <alaing> stringify as well?
[13:56:35] <shoky> and contentType
[13:56:45] <shoky> he wasn't sending it as JSON at first
[13:56:59] <alaing> hmm never used contentType for JSON
[13:56:59] <shoky> was sending it as if it's a regular form post
[13:57:14] <shoky> if you want the request body to be JSON that's what you need
[13:58:11] <peepsalot> whats a good way to set an attribute based on some other property of an element?  i don't think i can use attr for example.  like if i need to build a url to set  an image src based on its id
[13:58:18] <alaing> interesting. $.ajax has really changed of the last couple of versions
[13:58:39] <shoky> i doubt that part has changed much
[13:59:00] <alaing> peepsalot: .data?
[13:59:04] <tw2113> hopefully for the better
[13:59:32] <RandalSchwartz> it's not something the themeroller can fix.  oddly, on firefox, old and new came out the same.  so it's just that safari is getting sidetracked
[14:00:03] <RandalSchwartz> and safari's web inspector SUCKS.  it doesn't show font-size changes in the css stack
[14:00:08] <RandalSchwartz> only the final computed value
[14:00:10] <peepsalot> eh, i guess i just need to call something like .each(function (i,el) { el.src = el.id + "..."})
[14:00:20] <Wescotte> shoky: For shits and giggles I undid the JSON.stringify() part and just added them back as normal values outside of data and it did the same "untitled" thing again. What's the difference between putting those values in data vs outside of it?
[14:00:47] <alaing> good night peeps
[14:01:38] <shoky> Wescotte:  the "data" is the request body.  anything outside the data is options for $.ajax
[14:01:48] <shoky> Wescotte: $.ajax doesn't have a "parents" option or a "title" option.. etc.
[14:01:59] <shoky> doesn't make any sense to put it outside of the data
[14:02:58] <Wescotte> shoky: oh I just thought it everything through.
[14:03:41] <Wescotte> shoky: I could have appedned those values to the url like file?title=filename&mimeType.... though?
[14:04:11] <shoky> Wescotte: that's not what google tells you to do, so probably not
[14:04:16] <Wescotte> shoky: err oh I just thought it sent anything you specified through as it doesn't produce any error message/warnings if I assigned new arguments
[14:04:47] <shoky> Wescotte: jquery doesn't care if you put in an option that it doesn't recognize. it just gets ignored then
[14:04:49] <Wescotte> shoky: thank you again for all your help.
[14:04:54] <shoky> np
[14:06:01] <Wescotte> I sorta understand this stuff now :) sorta...
[14:06:28] <shoky> ;]
[14:08:37] <Wescotte> now I get to attempt to tackle Google Calender's API... So I'm sure I'll be back :)
[14:09:13] <Wescotte> somehow I managed to get through Fusion Tables already... but that was a headache in itself :)
[14:09:19] <shoky> whatcha working on
[14:11:33] <Wescotte> I'm just making a few custom tools for my brother's company. Really simple little programs in terms of logic. However, I do this stuff so infrequently that it's a constant battle to relearn everything.
[14:12:10] <Wescotte> Originally I was using a Google Spreadsheet as a tiny database. However, I learned that Google Apps Script won't let me access Google Maps V3 api so I can't do anything but static maps.
[14:12:36] <Wescotte> Then I learned about Fusion Tables and I actually prefer that over using a Spreadsheet since i can actually query via SQL.
[14:12:57] <Wescotte> However, I had drudge through the nightmare that was oauth2 in order to access any of the APIs
[14:13:57] <shoky> your bro better appreciate it ;P
[14:14:09] <Wescotte> shoky: I'm being paid so he doesn't have to :)
[14:14:16] <shoky> even better ;]
[14:14:50] <Wescotte> You don't have any Google Maps experience do you? ;)
[14:15:45] <shoky> heh not much, just from helping a few folks out here
[14:16:19] <Wescotte> Do you know if it's possible to actually save a map and retrieve it later or if I actually have to code that logic myself?
[14:16:59] <shoky> dunno, but i'd imagine it's possible somehow
[14:17:31] <orzel> hello. There's this common 'pattern' of a webpage with boxes (say 3*3 boxes), and you can move around one box, the other one will 'flow' to free the space under the cursor, until your release the mouse button
[14:17:45] <orzel> is it something available in jquery or in some jquery plugin ?
[14:17:47] <Wescotte> saving/loading is probably easy but figuring out how to push that data into the navigation functions on a phone is where I might stumble abit
[14:18:44] <shoky> mobile is one area i shy away from, for the most part
[14:19:28] <Wescotte> shoky: I can imagine it's a whole lot of headache. I don't have to add these features but they would be nice.

[14:21:41] <fission6> i want to replace the text in the 3rd column of a table with a link using the text already there how would i do this
[14:22:06] <Wescotte> hah
[14:23:03] <fission6> ?
[14:24:10] <fission6> $('#all td:eq(4)');
[14:24:15] <fission6> only gets the first row
[14:28:16] <shoky> fission6: try :nth-child(..)
[14:31:18] <fission6> that works
[14:31:28] <fission6> how would i update each item?
[14:31:30] <fission6> .each()
[14:31:38] <fission6> and html()
[14:32:52] <cpierce> !memcache
[14:35:04] <bonhoeffer> i'm confused foo[0] and foo.first are different things
[14:35:07] <tw2113> shoky, i found a good resource for you http://jsforcats.com/
[14:35:19] <bonhoeffer> foo.first.data() returns what i expect
[14:36:03] <bonhoeffer> i get TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'data'
[14:36:12] <bonhoeffer> from foo[0].data()
[14:36:26] <shoky> thx tw2113 saw that a couple days ago ;p
[14:36:32] <fission6> how do i change the content of each element in the matched set
[14:36:42] <tw2113> the real question though shoky is which are you, cat or human
[14:37:08] <shoky> that's yet to be determined
[14:37:36] * shoky purrs. belches.
[14:37:57] * Foxhoundz pets shoky
[14:38:19] <fission6> no one!?
[14:38:20] <shoky> fission6: .each() could help yeah
[14:39:14] <fission6> ill review, what about replaceWith
[14:39:22] <shoky> bonhoeffer:  [0] returns the actual DOMElement, .first() and .eq(0) return that same element wrapped in a jquery object
[14:39:26] <fission6> vs each($(this).html())
[14:39:46] <shoky> what about it?
[14:39:54] <mydog2> hmm.. got some test text inside a div.. i can clear the innerhtml.. but the text content is still there.. any pointers?
[14:39:56] <shoky> why don't you go try stuff and come back if you have a problem
[14:40:15] <fission6> shaky is replaceWith the same as each($(this).html=whatever)
[14:40:16] <mydog2> ie -- ('.foo).html("") still leaves the text...
[14:40:44] <shoky> fission6:  no
[14:40:50] <fission6> how not
[14:40:57] <shoky> why don't you go try stuff and come back if you have a problem
[14:41:09] <shoky> read the docs to see the difference
[14:41:14] <shoky> or.. try it and see
[14:42:05] <shoky> mydog2: .html('') should empty it.. but you can try .empty()   otherwise, make a jsfiddle that shows your problem
[14:43:13] <mydog2> shoky,  - tried both before i got here.. the text is still there...
[14:45:55] <mydog2> shoky.. never mind,,,
[14:46:04] <mydog2> shoky.. typo in the div id.. my bad..
[14:50:45] <samsoft> Hello house, please i need resource or help.. on how to can create a sidebar where data will be call database using jquery, get it through json and display it one after the other at the side bar of the page every desginated interval, like facebook side bar where recent comment is shown.. i will appreciate any help render.. thanks in advance
[14:51:00] <fission6> shoky: https://dpaste.de/xdUk3/ seems to work, any recs on improvements
[14:53:33] <freannrak> samsoft: start with the backend, then use jQuery.AJAX (or better backbone.JS if you're up to the challenge), then worry about the time interval refresh
[14:54:04] <orzel> is it possible to get this do this with jQuery (any link/pointer appreciated) : http://mathew-davies.co.uk/admin-template/dashboard.html
[14:54:13] <orzel> i mean moving boxes as in this (blow-based) example
[14:55:29] <samsoft> freannrak, thanks.. i already use jQuery and get through json and back to array, but my problem now is how to get it one after the other from the array and display it...
[14:58:23] <freannrak> samsoft: you mean you have an array of JSON objects and you need them to display in the DOM?
[15:01:38] <samsoft> freannrak, Yes... i have it in JSON and convert it back to array... now, i need to display it one after the other and after the last data in the array, go back and fetch another data from database using the previous method
[15:04:34] <farmer-duck_> evenin' everyone
[15:05:05] <farmer-duck_> can someone assist me on a ui-widget question?
[15:05:58] <Eviltwin> Please just ask your question, don't ask to ask
[15:06:31] <samsoft> freannrak, you u recieve my response
[15:08:44] <shoky> fission6: looks ok
[15:08:50] <fission6> thanks
[15:08:54] <samsoft> Hello house, please i need resource or help.. on how to can create a sidebar where data will be call database using jquery, get it through json and display it one after the other at the side bar of the page every desginated interval, like facebook side bar where recent comment is shown.. i will appreciate any help render.. thanks in advance
[15:09:41] <eN_Joy_> can someone take a look here: http://tmobile.blogsite.org/27-a-second-article-with-youtube I am trying to implement jQuery jPlayer on this site, but there's an error in circle.player.js that is included in the header, i have no idea as how to fix that;-)
[15:09:58] <farmer-duck_> sorry eviltwin ;) force of habit ;)
[15:11:43] <shoky> eN_Joy_: including mootools overwrites the global $ namespace which is used by that circle.player.js
[15:11:58] <boytoy> Hi, at this side panel: http://jsbin.com/ayulow/4/edit -- how do I prevent scrolling from being mistaken for clicks when scrolling over the dropdown links?
[15:12:01] <boytoy> I found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15248970/iframe-prevents-iscroll-scrolling-on-mobile-safari but its CSS messes a lot of stuff up.
[15:12:31] <eN_Joy_> boytoy: like this? var $j = jQuery.noConflict();
[15:12:42] <boytoy> eN_Joy_: lulz
[15:12:50] <shoky> eN_Joy_:  put this around the code in circle.player.js:   (function($) {   ... rest of code here ...  })(jQuery);
[15:13:21] <shoky> eN_Joy_: er well its not just mootools, i see you also got a noConflict() call
[15:13:50] <samsoft>  Hello house, please i need resource or help.. on how to can create a sidebar where data will be call database using jquery, get it through json and display it one after the other at the side bar of the page every desginated interval, like facebook side bar where recent comment is shown.. i will appreciate any help render.. thanks in advance
[15:14:58] <shoky> eN_Joy_:  and i guess you'll also need to replace:   var CirclePlayer = function...    with:   window.CirclePlayer = function...
[15:15:55] <shoky> eN_Joy_:  alternatively you could just replace every  $ in that file with  jQuery
[15:15:57] <eN_Joy_> shoky: yeah the error message changed to ReferenceError: CirclePlayer is not defined
[15:16:13] <shoky> eN_Joy_: yeah you need to do the 2nd thing i said for that
[15:16:24] <eN_Joy_> shoky: that sounds easier...
[15:17:29] <farmer-duck_> I'm trying to create a base/extended kind of widget. But my base class keeps complaining it doesn't have a trigger function
[15:17:52] <farmer-duck_> I'm using ui-1.9.2 and jquery-1.8.3
[15:17:55] <samsoft>  Please i need resource or help.. on how to can create a sidebar where data will be call database using jquery, get it through json and display it one after the other at the side bar of the page every desginated interval, like facebook side bar where recent comment is shown.. i will appreciate any help render.. thanks in advance
[15:18:15] <eN_Joy_> shoky: replaced $ and worked out like a charm! also how do i make a irc copy of this screen? using irssi here
[15:18:34] <shoky> eN_Joy_: adunno ;P
[15:18:35] <eN_Joy_> 'cuz it scrolls too fast;-)
[15:18:53] <shoky> eN_Joy_: make it hide joins/parts/quits/etc
[15:19:04] <farmer-duck_> samsoft, look at a timeout
[15:19:30] <shoky> farmer-duck_: make a jsfiddle showing your issue
[15:20:01] <farmer-duck_> shoky pastebin alright? got that one ready :)
[15:20:04] <farmer-duck_> http://pastebin.com/f6Mna8xe
[15:20:19] <samsoft> farmer-duck: where is the timeout.. kindly help
[15:20:20] <RandalSchwartz> jsfiddle is better, because we ... can fiddle :)
[15:20:28] <shoky> farmer-duck_: it's alright but now i need to do your work for you and copy it to jsfiddle so i can fiddle with it
[15:21:53] <shoky> farmer-duck_: http://jsfiddle.net/rDVGT/   add the usage of your widget
[15:22:01] <farmer-duck_> sorry shoky, won't happen again, I'm allready signing up
[15:22:13] <shoky> no need to sign up ;p
[15:23:56] <samsoft> i need resource or help.. on how to can create a sidebar where data will be call database using jquery, get it through json and display it one after the other at the side bar of the page every desginated interval, like facebook side bar where recent comment is shown.. i will appreciate any help render..
[15:24:43] <shoky> samsoft: it doesn't work like that, you can't just come in here and say 'i need a page that does a,b,c,d,e , please help'
[15:24:55] <shoky> samsoft: do some work on your own, and when you have a specific problem, come here and ask
[15:25:09] <shoky> samsoft: and in either case, stop spamming every 5 minutes
[15:25:54] <farmer-duck_> http://jsfiddle.net/farmerduck/rDVGT/1/
[15:26:31] <shoky> farmer-duck_: oks, and example usage?
[15:27:31] <shoky> farmer-duck_: first thing i see is.. self.trigger('done', response);    but self wasn't defined anywhere
[15:27:36] <samsoft> alright thanks!
[15:27:56] <farmer-duck_> description. The anchor click is bound with romCircle widget, to execute imgAction -> sendRequest which is derived from ajax and eventually it should endup calling trigger -> ajax.done as inserted from rom circle
[15:28:24] <shoky> code would be better
[15:28:25] <farmer-duck_> oeps... dev issue
[15:29:32] <farmer-duck_> http://jsfiddle.net/farmerduck/rDVGT/2/
[15:29:51] <farmer-duck_> http://jsfiddle.net/farmerduck/rDVGT/3/
[15:30:11] <farmer-duck_> shoky which kind of code do you mean?
[15:30:26] <shoky> farmer-duck_: usage of your widget
[15:30:29] <samsoft> please i have array with consist of 5 data, i can i pull out each data every 2minutes to the DOM using interval and when it get to the last one, load another data, i have the data already which is fetch from database using jQuery ajax
[15:30:39] <shoky> farmer-duck_: to see the error, for example..
[15:30:48] <farmer-duck_> ah
[15:31:04] <farmer-duck_> 2
[15:31:04] <farmer-duck_> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object global] has no method 'trigger'
[15:31:12] <Eviltwin> That's an error
[15:31:14] <Eviltwin> That's not code
[15:31:25] <Eviltwin> He's asking for you to show a demo of your widget in action
[15:31:30] <shoky> ^
[15:31:35] <Eviltwin> A demo that produces that error
[15:31:55] <farmer-duck_> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object global] has no method 'trigger' ui.bergop.ajax.js:26
[15:31:55] <farmer-duck_> $.widget.sendRequest
[15:32:06] <Eviltwin> That's an error
[15:32:08] <Eviltwin> He's asking for you to show a demo of your widget in action
[15:32:10] <Eviltwin> A demo that produces that error
[15:32:11] <shoky> farmer-duck_:  self isn't defined
[15:32:43] <farmer-duck_> it sure is :)
[15:32:44] <shoky> farmer-duck_: var self = this  in that first _create function is just a local variable inside that function
[15:33:09] <farmer-duck_> in the .ajax it is also assigned
[15:33:24] <farmer-duck_> http://jsfiddle.net/farmerduck/rDVGT/3/
[15:33:38] <shoky> no, it's not defined..
[15:34:06] <samsoft> watching... lol
[15:34:13] <farmer-duck_> can you explain me why it isn't?
[15:34:23] <shoky> farmer-duck_:  put code that actually uses your widget... a demo so that we can see the error happening in OUR browser
[15:34:30] <farmer-duck_> 'cause I define it in ajax, imgAction and circle
[15:34:38] <shoky> farmer-duck_:  because variables are local to the function you define them in
[15:34:43] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ farmer-duck_
[15:34:43] <b-ot> farmer-duck_: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:34:45] <bot-t1> farmer-duck_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:35:08] <farmer-duck_> kk hold on for a sec please :)
[15:35:47] <samsoft> okay farmer-duck
[15:41:02] <farmer-duck_> shoky, how do I enable a ajax request to google.com?
[15:41:20] <farmer-duck_> or a other heartbeat signal :)
[15:41:41] <shoky> huh?
[15:42:14] <shoky> don't really know what you're asking.. but you can $.post('/echo/json/')
[15:42:23] <samsoft> how can i get to php channe;
[15:42:52] <shoky> samsoft: you need to register your nick. type /msg nickserv help register
[15:43:52] <samsoft> shoky: type the where
[15:44:00] <shoky> samsoft: IRC
[15:44:07] <shoky> like.. here
[16:00:49] <farmer-duck_> shoky send you a PM
[16:01:13] <farmer-duck_> the expected behavior is a double alert
[16:09:15] <Pinkamena_D> Hello, I have begun using the datetime-local  polyfill library for support of non-html5 browsers. Works good in firefox. (chrome just uses html5) internet explorer shows a bunch of "NaN"'s on the calander. Any idea what I might have done wrong?
[16:13:19] <Pinkamena_D> oh, and here is the example page
[16:13:20] <Pinkamena_D> http://www.jewellsmusicstudio.tk/newform.php
[16:14:17] <Pinkamena_D> some people have claimed it works in some versions of internet explorer, but not all of them
[16:19:05] <freebir> you guys, please, I've this code in here, it's an Jquery alert, and I'ts being called by a button, but I want to remove the button, and be able to call it from a JS line, the problem is that I don't know JS, how can I do that ? http://www.codesend.com/view/d0aba310834d8d703b560802de14beb9/
[16:20:20] <shoky> farmer-duck_:  welp it's like i told ya, self isn't defined there
[16:21:00] <shoky> farmer-duck_:  doing var self = this;  in one function  doesn't add it to another separate function
[16:21:02] <farmer-duck_> I think I'm starting to feel you shoky,
[16:21:17] <farmer-duck_> but damn... how do I get the self inside then?
[16:21:36] <shoky> farmer-duck_: put  var self = this;  as first line in sendRequest
[16:21:39] <farmer-duck_> I thought that was the wayu
[16:21:42] <farmer-duck_> I thought that was the way
[16:22:31] <farmer-duck_> damn you shoky :P
[16:22:35] <farmer-duck_> arrgghhhh
[16:22:44] <farmer-duck_> I hate to  say it...
[16:22:51] <farmer-duck_> but you're right... thank!
[16:22:51] <shoky> heh
[16:22:58] <shoky> np ;P
[16:23:36] <shoky> what's surprising to me is that self === window  automatically
[16:23:37] <farmer-duck_> I'm more a Compiled guy myself... and each time again... the closure scope beats me
[16:23:55] <farmer-duck_> I sometimes wonder why web isn't as easy as compiled ;)
[16:23:59] <shoky> (i know 'this' behaves like that but why tf is self also)
[16:24:17] <farmer-duck_> yea inddd
[16:24:26] <shoky> i doubt compiled/non-compiled has anything to do with it
[16:24:33] <shoky> javascript is not trivial
[16:25:41] <farmer-duck_> no it's not the compiled itself
[16:26:12] <farmer-duck_> completly true, but with compiled, this === this and that === that...
[16:26:16] <farmer-duck_> all the time...
[16:26:25] <sacho> what's self?
[16:26:27] <farmer-duck_> that's what makes it more workable ;)
[16:26:43] <Eviltwin> ?
[16:26:46] <shoky> sacho:  in chrome and FF apparently it's === this === window
[16:26:48] <shoky> wtf.
[16:27:01] <shoky> in IE it looks like window also  but self===window gives false
[16:27:05] <sacho> you mean a global property?
[16:27:11] <shoky> yeah, i had no idea
[16:27:24] <sacho> want some real wtf
[16:27:29] <shoky> surely
[16:27:31] <sacho> try in the FF console: this === window
[16:27:42] <shoky> true
[16:27:47] <Eviltwin> window.self
[16:27:50] <sacho> which FF?
[16:27:52] <shoky> ahhhhh
[16:28:15] <shoky> 21.0
[16:28:35] <shoky> totally forgot about window.self
[16:28:55] <shoky> that's some confusing shit
[16:30:37] <shoky> thx Eviltwin
[16:31:50] <freebir> please, can someone help me ?? please ?
[16:31:55] <freebir> it's very important
[16:32:11] <shoky> how important?
[16:32:26] <farmer-duck_> like -> jQuery(this).remove() ;)
[16:33:39] <freebir> shoky, very man, it's simple to someone that understands, check this link, when I hit the button, I get an alert, but I want to see the alert, but calling the function, not when I click in the button
[16:33:40] <freebir> http://www.codesend.com/view/d0aba310834d8d703b560802de14beb9/
[16:34:16] <freebir> I want to see the alert after I call a function in my code, not by clicking in the button, get it ? tks
[16:34:41] <shoky> freebir:  do what the onclick does then.. i guess?
[16:34:53] <farmer-duck_> freebir -> http://jsfiddle.net/farmerduck/nj2v2/
[16:35:17] <farmer-duck_> oh nvm
[16:35:53] <farmer-duck_> thought you meant to remove the button -..-
[16:37:18] <freebir> farmer-duck, doesn't work
[16:37:37] <shoky> freebir:  alertify.alert("This is an alert dialog");    that looks like what you'd wanna call...
[16:37:48] <freebir> I want to load the alert function by calling the function]
[16:37:52] <freebir> ok, I'll try
[16:37:53] <freebir> shoky,
[16:38:21] <shoky> and call reset() once too i suppose
[16:38:29] <farmer-duck_> freebir...
[16:38:33] <shoky> or many times ;S
[16:38:47] <farmer-duck_> $("confirm")     -> $("#confirm")
[16:38:55] <shoky> farmer-duck_: nah he's not using jquery
[16:39:12] <farmer-duck_> mmm why not :P
[16:39:20] <farmer-duck_> much more fun (A)
[16:39:24] <shoky> it must me too important ;P
[16:39:37] <shoky> be*
[16:39:37] <farmer-duck_> alertify works on prototype i guess?
[16:39:55] <shoky> *shrugs*
[16:40:30] <farmer-duck_> argh also nvm
[16:40:35] <farmer-duck_> I call it a day ;)
[16:40:58] <farmer-duck_> to much vodka-coke (3/1) for me ;)
[16:41:45] <farmer-duck_> thx for the help again see you guess again :)
[16:43:22] <freebir> doesn't work, but if I add the button, that it it works, even without clicking, I get what I want
[16:43:23] <freebir> weird
[16:43:24] <freebir> http://www.codesend.com/view/8d5eebd420a33e21be38c90a074bb778/
[16:43:28] <freebir> farmer-duck, shoky
[16:45:20] <shoky> freebir: add reset();  before the alert.  and put that new <script> AFTER the one you have there
[16:45:50] <freebir> shoky, I get it man
[16:46:05] <freebir> I need the id specified in there, check it out
[16:46:06] <freebir> http://www.codesend.com/view/7c03afae16606b6ebefde6b8af8a304a/
[16:46:34] <shoky> <class>  ??
[16:49:52] <freebir> tks a lot you guys
[16:49:55] <freebir> shoky, wrong ?
[16:50:15] <freebir> <span class="button-primary" href="#" id="confirm">
[16:50:15] <shoky> freebir:  i'd go with..  http://www.codesend.com/view/910589971aa44175d20a007ded21acbc/
[16:51:21] <freebir> shoky, doesn't work man
[16:52:14] <shoky> freebir: ok man do it your way
[16:52:35] <freebir> well, if it works, why not ?  but thanks for the help

[16:53:16] <freebir> <span class="button-primary" id="confirm"> </span>
[17:33:30] <juboba> hey
[17:34:16] <juboba> I'm trying to upgrade from 1.9.2 to 1.10 and I see lot's of different things. Do I have to include manually the piece of jqueryui that I need to use?
[17:34:31] <juboba> I see lots of accordion.js dialog.js, etc files
[17:40:45] <HarryPitfall> nope
[17:40:50] <HarryPitfall> you need to use the correct js
[17:41:01] <HarryPitfall> is very possible that you download the wrong file
[17:48:17] <juboba> thanks HarryPitfall
[17:48:19] <juboba> got it
[17:48:26] <juboba> just upgraded
[17:49:23] <HarryPitfall> I found something that will be amazing good for my website
[17:49:51] <HarryPitfall> A plugin to turn textarea into same kind of facebook textareas...
[17:50:24] <juboba> does anybody know why I'm getting this instead of nice tabs (this happens with the new css, tabs work fine with 1.9.2 and lower css)? http://146.83.199.100/~juboba/file/download/679
[17:50:37] <juboba> wow
[17:50:43] <juboba> nice HarryPitfall where?
[17:50:45] <juboba> I could use that

[18:38:39] <YammYcoding> hello folks
[18:39:21] <YammYcoding> I want to add some onclick events on specific tags, with jquery. How can i do that?
[18:39:21] <grafi> hi there
[18:40:22] <grafi> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:41:05] <YammYcoding> no. i mean if <a href class='foo'>    change to <a href class='foo' onclick='bar'>
[18:41:39] <gordian> hey guys, can anyone explain the differences between these code blocks? http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=VdqpSRaN
[18:43:27] <grafi> YammYcoding jQuery doenst go around your html adding onclick="something" to your code
[18:44:50] <shoky> gordian: 1 executes right away, 2 executes on DOM-ready, 3 happens on window 'load' event
[18:44:56] <YammYcoding> hmm using the on('click') ....does the same?
[18:45:19] <gordian> shoky: thank you
[18:45:39] <grafi> yup
[18:45:47] <gordian> i guess i'm wondering why the first line is necessary rather than just beginning js at line 1
[18:46:00] <gordian> then callind $(document).ready and $(window).load
[18:46:11] <gordian> calling
[18:46:20] <gordian> for blocks 2 and 3
[18:46:36] <Eviltwin> $(document).ready executes after the DOM is there (the HTML has loaded but not necessarily the images in the page yet)
[18:46:37] <shoky> gordian: it's not necessary, but it gives the code inside a local scope so variables defined inside won't pollute the global namespace
[18:46:51] <Eviltwin> $(window).load executes after all HTML and images in the HTML etc have loaded
[18:47:43] <gordian> interesting
[18:48:10] <gordian> can you give an example of when it would be necessary?
[18:48:20] <shoky> i just said it's not neccessary ;P
[18:48:22] <gordian> don't mean to be a jerk i genuinely want to know
[18:48:32] <gordian> and it's tough to search for that
[18:48:40] <Eviltwin> The first one is necessary if your JavaScript is included at the top of the document (like before the body)
[18:48:46] <Eviltwin> And elements you're trying to operate are below it
[18:48:51] <Eviltwin> In the HTML
[18:48:59] <shoky> i think he's asking about the IIFE
[18:49:14] <Eviltwin> Oh, perhaps
[18:49:17] <Eviltwin> I don't know
[18:49:34] <Eviltwin> gordian: Which block were you asking about?
[18:49:52] <gordian> i'm trying to understand all of them and why they are where they are
[18:49:57] <gordian> and if that's the only way to do it
[18:50:07] <gordian> and the advantages/drawbacks of arranging the blocks that way
[18:50:55] <shoky> gordian: anyways i was only talking about lines 1 and 23 , not the inner blocks, so dont let me confuse you
[18:51:21] <grafi> although the question does already sound confused to me :|
[18:51:27] <gordian> shoky: i get it
[18:51:30] <gordian> thank you
[18:51:52] <gordian> it's just a tough search term
[18:52:07] <shoky> because you're asking about 3 different things..
[18:52:46] <gordian> or perhaps i'm just asking about 1 thing with 3 different parts ;-)
[18:52:56] <Eviltwin> gordian: http://pastebin.com/9aYvpeH6
[18:52:56] <shoky> perhaps, but , no :)
[18:53:07] <gordian> i'm asking about that particular arrangement
[18:53:34] <Eviltwin> (function () { ... })() serves a very different purpose from $(document).ready(function () { ... }) or $(window).load(function () { ... })
[18:54:06] <Eviltwin> (function () { ... })() means that any variables or functions declared in the ... won't be accessable from outside and won't conflict with variables or functions outside
[18:54:40] <Eviltwin> $(document).ready and $(window).load are for having your code wait until the DOM is ready or the page is loaded
[18:54:48] <Eviltwin> (function () { ... })() doesn't wait for anything, it runs right away
[18:55:16] <gordian> ok
[18:55:32] <gordian> i guess i also didn't understand why my pastebin has line 7 within line 1
[18:55:54] <gordian> (or why code block 2 needs to be enclosed by line 7 & 13
[18:57:47] <Eviltwin> gordian: http://pastebin.com/nHuGeSGP
[18:57:56] <Eviltwin> It's because of what variables and functions can be accessed
[18:58:14] <gordian> Eviltwin: VERY helpful, thank you for both pastebins
[18:58:29] <Eviltwin> Also for that last one
[18:58:29] <gordian> i'm just a lowly hacker trying to figure this stuff out
[18:58:49] <Eviltwin> Note that stuff outside all of those functions cannot access any variables or functions defined in any of the three blocks
[18:59:03] <Eviltwin> In either arrangement
[18:59:37] <gordian> these are great
[18:59:49] <gordian> i'll have to try some jsfiddles to really get the hang of it
[18:59:58] <gordian> but these are awesome, thank you again
[19:00:39] <Eviltwin> No problem, my pleasure
[19:00:45] <grafi> good work everybody, let's take 5
[19:01:09] <gordian> definitely
[19:01:13] * jedimind packs up and goes home
[19:01:18] <gordian> gonna try out my new e-cigarette
[19:01:36] <grafi> is that a different kind of cancer?
[19:01:51] <jedimind> yeah, the cancer free kind
[19:02:00] <grafi> cancer free
[19:02:07] <gordian> not sure
[19:02:10] <grafi> no such thing
[19:02:10] <gordian> i guess nobody knows
[19:02:19] <gordian> but no tar or tobacco
[19:02:27] <grafi> with enough research i bet everything causes cancer
[19:02:29] <gordian> so i doubt it's possible to be worse
[19:02:42] <gordian> it's vaporized water with flavor
[19:02:53] <jedimind> it has nicotene
[19:03:05] <jedimind> and vaporizes it so there are no carcinogens
[19:03:07] <gordian> jedimind: not the flavors i fot
[19:03:09] <gordian> got
[19:03:16] <Eviltwin> Nicotene is not a carcinogen
[19:03:20] <gordian> i got the nicotene free
[19:03:31] <jedimind> Eviltwin:  no but when you burn a cigarette
[19:04:26] <Eviltwin> Cigarettes are loaded with carcinogens but nicotine is not one of them
[19:04:45] <jedimind> i know that
[19:04:52] <Eviltwin> Holy shit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cigarette_smoke_carcinogens
[19:04:56] <jedimind> which is what i was saying comparing ecigarette to a real cigarette
[19:04:57] <Eviltwin> That's a lot of different carcinogens
[19:04:59] <grafi> isnt the main problem in cancer research that you have to wait 40years to see any kind of effects?
[19:05:47] <jedimind> im sure there are many problems :)
[19:06:05] <Eviltwin> You can play with the dosages to accelerate the effects
[19:07:27] <grafi> thats probably a general rule ;)
[19:10:49] <jedimind> i feel weird using a wii-u to stream UFC but i know its irrational
[19:19:01] <gordian> it does kinda smell like the smoke coming out of fog machines
[19:19:30] <gordian> but actually it's quite satisfying and much cleaner
[19:21:41] <grafi> so you are smoking a e-cigarette with no nicotene now?
[19:30:46] <gordian> yup
[19:31:08] <EwokFartPorn> usb powered?
[19:31:15] <gordian> and i don't want to stray too far off the topic but this brand also actually has a USB powered ecig
[19:31:29] <EwokFartPorn> Awesome.
[19:31:37] <gordian> EwokFartPorn: one came with my kit and it works brilliantly but i'm not using that one just now
[19:32:56] <gordian> …if only i could download more flavors then it would be perfect
[19:34:24] <EwokFartPorn> lol
[19:50:29] <grafi> but whats the point in a cigarette if its not the nicotene? not that i understand the need to consume nicotene
[20:03:02] <TheJHAU> o/
[20:03:15] <TheJHAU> can i append the contents of a div ?
[20:03:15] <EwokFartPorn> \o
[20:03:50] <shoky> yes
[20:04:18] <TheJHAU> how would i do that :o
[20:04:54] <shoky> .append( $('#mydiv').contents() )    :\
[20:05:07] <shoky> you should probably ask a better question
[20:05:36] <TheJHAU> sorry ?
[20:05:53] <shoky> well, that's how you do it.
[20:06:00] <TheJHAU> yeah thanks :)
[20:07:10] <shoky> notice it'd append the actual contents of the div.. not a copy of the contents ;p
[20:09:09] <gordian> grafi: i just like the smoke
[20:09:46] <grafi> as long as you are happy im happy :P
[20:10:32] <TheJHAU> $('div.t').text()
[20:10:36] <TheJHAU> :P did that instead
[20:31:26] <samsoft> how ?
[20:37:44] <Eviltwin> samsoft: Care to be more specific?
[20:37:48] <v0lksman> anyone willing to take a peek at this: https://dpaste.de/RJ5Kk/  this is loaded as a response to an ajax call (so partial page content).  If I place the ajax call after page load the map comes back broken with Cannot read property 'spherical' of undefined, but the second time I call it renders just fine.  I know it has something to do with initializing the map but I'm unclear what I'm supposed to do
[20:38:58] <Eviltwin> v0lksman: This doesn't look like JavaScript to me
[20:39:07] <Eviltwin> It looks like some kind of Ruby
[20:39:17] <v0lksman> Eviltwin: it's mixed with a little template magic yes
[20:39:25] <v0lksman> (django not ror)
[20:39:38] <Eviltwin> How about you render this and ask again
[20:40:06] <otiuk> ..
[20:40:37] <samsoft> Eviltwin: thanks...what i'm trying to achieve is like the facebook side notification, where message comes in at interval... now, have already connect to database using jQuery and Ajax, have the data inside the array... i want to know how i can get the data out of array one after the other within an interval
[20:41:10] <otiuk> I have a .click adding a LI with a link that i want to be able to add an additional LI but when you click the link it doesn't do anything
[20:41:24] <otiuk> i'm guessing because the link was added using .append
[20:41:39] <otiuk> that it doesn't recognize that click action on that link or something
[20:42:40] <samsoft> Eviltwin: and after the last message has been pulled out, it will automatic fetch another data again using the previous method by fetch data using jQuery and Ajax
[20:43:22] <v0lksman> Eviltwin: https://dpaste.de/TjcOE/ <- better?  I left in the polyline as it works with lines and points but as soon as I render a poly it errors this way, and really only because I'm trying to get the area of the poly (line 110)
[20:44:17] <otiuk> i guess i had to add a .delegate handler ... got it to work
[20:45:31] <Eviltwin> samsoft: You can do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6KauV/
[20:47:55] <samsoft> Eviltwin: thanks.. checking...
[20:49:20] <Eviltwin> v0lksman: Have you looked at this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15226053/google-maps-geometry-spherical-error
[20:50:07] <v0lksman> Eviltwin: yeah, I tried loading that both on page and in the partial and in both places I get an error about loading the gmaps api twice
[20:50:37] <Eviltwin> You're sure the libraries=geometry is there?
[20:51:20] <v0lksman> no...I just call in the api.  the api takes care of calling in that lib on init I'm guessing
[20:51:31] <v0lksman> hrm
[20:51:40] <Eviltwin> So...you're not including the gmaps API?
[20:52:04] <v0lksman> yeah I am, just not specifically requesting that lib (just the api)
[20:52:16] <Eviltwin> Sounds like that lib is not included by default
[20:52:20] <Eviltwin> And needs to be if you want to use it
[20:53:10] <v0lksman> Eviltwin: yep...thanks for making me read again.. :)  I just added that lib= to the existing api call...duh
[20:54:27] <mydog2> jquery gods!!!
[20:55:31] <mydog2> i'm trying to do a test, where i have a section of html/div.. and i copy it into another section of the page ie, from one div, to another..
[20:55:36] <mydog2> that works..
[20:56:15] <samsoft> Eviltwin: Thanks... i appreciate
[20:56:16] <mydog2> within the copied div..i have a button that i dynamically change the name of the button.. this is where the issue happens..
[20:56:44] <mydog2> i can have a static button.. with the same name.. i click it, i get the test jquery function..
[20:57:19] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ mydog2
[20:57:20] <b-ot> mydog2: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:57:20] <bot-t> mydog2, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:57:21] <mydog2> however, with the dynamically created button. even though in the source it has the same name..
[20:58:09] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - this is on my lap... should be able to run on fiddle.. only 20-30 lines of jquery.. let me try
[21:05:51] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - here you go.. it's crude..   .. http://jsfiddle.net/2DDRX/1/  <<
[21:06:01] <mydog2> select the insert radio btn
[21:06:22] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[21:06:22] <mydog2> then select the createProj btn.. not the proj11 btn
[21:06:41] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/2DDRX/1/
[21:06:46] <Eviltwin> That's what you sent me
[21:07:02] <Eviltwin> You put a click listener on it that does effectively nothing
[21:07:56] <mydog2> what should happen.. is that the createProj btn should invoke a jquery function..
[21:08:03] <mydog2> evil.. hmm.. hold on..
[21:08:36] <mydog2> that's not the right fiddle that i just inserted.. didn't sacve what i just inserted..
[21:09:12] <mydog2> http://jsfiddle.net/2DDRX/2/   <<<
[21:09:20] <mydog2> this should be the right one..
[21:10:18] <mydog2> the dynamically generated btn for the CreateProj should invoke the jquery function -- $("[name=tb_a]").click(function () {<<< and it doesn't..
[21:10:27] <tw2113> mydog2, get rid of that alert shit
[21:10:31] <tw2113> use console.log
[21:10:44] <mydog2> hey tw2113  - how's the day...
[21:10:55] <tw2113> same alert, new day
[21:11:43] <mydog2> it appears that if i create a dynamic button with the set name/id i can't use it to invoke the jquery function...
[21:12:10] <mydog2> but if i have a static button with the same name/id.. the button invokes the jquery..
[21:14:13] <mydog2> is that due to the browser/javascript engine somehow maintaining a state of which elements/attributes  (name/class/id) are created or available at runtime..
[21:14:18] <mydog2> how does that all work?
[21:15:12] <NChief> uae on
[21:16:54] <mydog2> or is this really due to the app already having an initial copy of the button already in the page
[21:18:14] <Eviltwin> mydog2: Can you explain what the goal here is exactly?
[21:18:48] <Eviltwin> Oh
[21:18:51] <Eviltwin> You did in the fiddle
[21:20:07] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - yeah..
[21:20:28] <mydog2> basically.. i have a series of radio btns.. user will select to edit.. do some stuff..
[21:21:02] <mydog2> my hangup/curiousity now.. is how to copy a btn i created in one div to another..
[21:21:37] <mydog2> ie, when you select the "create" radio btn.. (excuse the alerts)
[21:22:28] <mydog2> the test copies/modifies some html/dom from one part of the page to another.. part of this is a btn that also invokes a jquery function when selected..
[21:23:16] <mydog2> if i select the initial btn from the initial html, the button calls the jquery function (on the click)..
[21:23:32] <mydog2> however, the new btn doesn't call the jquery function..
[21:24:02] <mydog2> i also tried to simply delete the btn from the dom prior to selecting the new btn, no luck..
[21:25:40] <Eviltwin> mydog2: http://jsfiddle.net/Gd2qZ/
[21:25:53] <Eviltwin> Is that what you're looking for?
[21:27:31] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - no.. i don't have a probablem copying parts of the dom from one section to another...
[21:27:50] <Eviltwin> ...this is copying parts of the DOM from one section to another
[21:27:54] <mydog2> hang on.. let me clean up the initial example i posted
[21:29:02] <mydog2> my problem.. is that i create a btn.. that has a name="tb_a" that should work.. all i do is copy the dom/button from one section of the page to another.. but it doesn't!!!
[21:29:14] <mydog2> if i select the 1st button.. it works...
[21:29:37] <mydog2> and i have no idea why this would cause an issue..
[21:30:45] <Eviltwin> mydog2: For one thing doing .replace() on HTML is the wrong way to do this
[21:32:02] <Eviltwin> My code copies a portion of the DOM, changes the names and IDs as required, and allows them to be reinserted whereever you want
[21:33:10] <mydog2> http://jsfiddle.net/2DDRX/6/   <<<<
[21:33:23] <mydog2> i cleaned it up..
[21:33:35] <mydog2> basically.. you select the "insert btn"
[21:34:06] <mydog2> that then creates the process where the chunk of code is copied/modifed by the "insert" jquery function
[21:34:33] <mydog2> at that poin.. it also creates a btn, which has the same name as the "WorkingBTN"
[21:35:02] <mydog2> if you select the workingBTN.. you'll see it calls the jquery "name=tb_a" function
[21:35:32] <mydog2> however, if you select the new createProj btn.. you'll note it doesn't work..
[21:36:11] <mydog2> but if you lok at the underlying source.. at least in FF (not sure of fiddle) then you'll see the name attribute of the btns is the exact same..
[21:36:41] <Eviltwin> mydog2: How about you take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/Gd2qZ/1/
[21:36:46] <mydog2> and all i'm doing in this case is copying the btn.. not changing any of the attributes at all
[21:36:57] <Eviltwin> See how there are three Click Me! buttons
[21:36:59] <Eviltwin> Try clicking them
[21:37:32] <Eviltwin> The reason your method of copying isn't working is because HTMLs don't contain all of the information stored in the DOM
[21:37:49] <Eviltwin> HTML doesn't*
[21:38:50] <mydog2> so.. are you copying a button to another part of the dom?
[21:39:34] <Eviltwin> I am copying a button. some radio buttons, and a text input
[21:40:05] <mydog2> it appears you clone the initial div 3 times to get your 3 rows
[21:40:42] <Eviltwin> I do not
[21:40:49] <Eviltwin> I clone the initial div twice
[21:40:54] <Eviltwin> The first row is the original
[21:40:57] <Eviltwin> The second two are clones
[21:41:01] <mydog2> right..
[21:41:05] <mydog2> imeant 2 times..
[21:41:19] <Eviltwin> How is this wildly different from what you're trying to do?
[21:42:00] <mydog2> let me back up a sec... when you clone.. you get the entire dom.. from the initial element and all children..
[21:42:24] <mydog2> is there a way to "clone",, but restrict the cloned information to all th einnerHTML?
[21:42:26] <Eviltwin> When you clone you get a copy of the DOM under the element you cloend
[21:42:29] <Eviltwin> cloned*
[21:42:32] <mydog2> the innerHTML
[21:42:35] <Eviltwin> You don't clone the entire DOM
[21:43:19] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - right... that's what i said.. from the initial "specified" element.. my bad.. left out the "specified"
[21:43:33] <Eviltwin> So how is this wildly different from what you're trying to do?
[21:44:05] <mydog2> but if i don't want the current element.. but i want all the children... can that be easily accomplished with jquery?
[21:44:33] <mydog2> the reason i went with the .html() was because that gave me all the innerHTML..
[21:44:36] <Eviltwin> mydog2: Here: http://jsfiddle.net/Gd2qZ/2/
[21:44:43] <Eviltwin> Do not use innerHTML
[21:44:49] <Eviltwin> It will not work for this situation
[21:45:24] <mydog2> i could craft javascript to do this with different javascript/dom functiandles thisons.. but i was trying to grasp how jquery h
[21:45:35] <mydog2> god.. keyboard screwed up there..
[21:47:26] <Eviltwin> If your JavaScript invovles the innerHTML property, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG
[21:47:43] <coldhead> harsh
[21:47:58] <Eviltwin> If your JavaScript involves using a .replace() on a string to change names, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG
[21:48:10] <Eviltwin> What I have shown you is the right way to do it
[21:52:18] <Eviltwin> I'm sorry, that was probably a lot more harsh than I should have been
[21:52:36] <Eviltwin> I'm frustrated with one of my own problems right now
[22:05:16] <fender0107401> I got this: "Reload the page to get source for:" when perform ajax.
[22:05:37] <fender0107401> I don't know what is that means?
[22:07:06] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - but you haven't show me how to do what i want to do..
[22:07:19] <mydog2> there's a comminucations disconnect..
[22:07:25] <Eviltwin> mydog2: Please explain exactly what you want to do
[22:09:24] <mydog2> here's a simpler question.. is there a way/jquery to do a clone, but leave out the specified element/level..  ie, if i want to get all the children of a div, i would specify the div/id and then clone it.. but would get the div as well.. i'm looking to slice off the div.. to then have the innerHTML if you will
[22:09:50] <Eviltwin> ?contents @ mydog2
[22:09:51] <bot-t> mydog2, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[22:09:56] <Eviltwin> Did you actually look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/Gd2qZ/2/
[22:10:39] <mydog2> if i could figure that out..
[22:10:47] <mydog2> EvilEmpire, = i looked...
[22:11:00] <Eviltwin> I think the last line is confusing you
[22:11:08] <Eviltwin> Look at this and look at the HTML of the panel on the bottom right: http://jsfiddle.net/Gd2qZ/3/
[22:12:19] <Eviltwin> I select the element with id foobar
[22:12:25] <mydog2> ok.. it's doing some appends.. clones.. renames..
[22:12:48] <Eviltwin> ...yes....
[22:13:21] <mydog2> what i'd like .. is a way for jquery to sau.. given me the innerHTML of the foobar div..
[22:13:46] <Eviltwin> ...why
[22:13:48] <mydog2> so I'd simply get a dom obj/list of the input items..
[22:14:21] <Eviltwin> I think you need to stop using the term innerHTML
[22:14:32] <Eviltwin> innerHTML is a string, it's not "DOM objects" or a list
[22:15:04] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - call it inner dom obj then
[22:15:06] <Eviltwin> What I believe you are referring to are the child nodes or "contents" of the element as jQuery calls it
[22:15:14] <Eviltwin> It's what .contents() gets from an element
[22:15:31] <mydog2> i'm looking to get the representation of the dom elements that have the div as the parent node
[22:15:39] <Eviltwin> It's why I linked you to this: http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[22:15:44] <Eviltwin> This is the method you're looking for
[22:16:09] <mydog2> so you're saying contents wil do that.. let me checck on it.. thanks..
[22:16:48] <Eviltwin> In my example, in my rename function
[22:17:02] <Eviltwin> I'm doing tree.find("[id], [name]").addSelf()
[22:17:29] <Eviltwin> Which selects all of the descendants of tree that have an id or name attribute
[22:17:46] <Eviltwin> Then adds the tree collection back into the collection
[22:17:58] <Eviltwin> And then the .each() calls a function for each of those elements
[22:18:00] <Eviltwin> So in the end
[22:18:15] <Eviltwin> What this function is doing is visiting each node in that tree that has a name or id
[22:18:20] <Eviltwin> And it's modifying that name or id
[22:18:30] <Eviltwin> by appending the string I specify to it
[22:22:02] <mydog2> EvilEmpire,  - lookd like the content will be good...
[22:22:23] <mydog2> and i got your explanation.. thanks
[22:22:38] <Eviltwin> Notice that .contents() gets the child nodes of the element, it does not get all of the descendants of the element
[22:22:41] <Eviltwin> In other words
[22:22:55] <Eviltwin> <div><span><b></b></span><a></a></div>
[22:23:01] <Eviltwin> If you have the div selected
[22:23:03] <Eviltwin> And you call .contents()
[22:23:15] <Eviltwin> You will see [ <span>, <a> ] but not the <b>
[22:24:18] <Eviltwin> If you'd like every element contained in that div (including things inside other things)
[22:24:23] <Eviltwin> You want to use .find('*')
[22:24:25] <Eviltwin> .find('*
[22:24:27] <Eviltwin> ')
[22:24:36] <Eviltwin> on that div will give you [ <span>, <b>, <a> ]

[23:20:56] <lemonsparrow> macmartine: I get the first alert "Hello Bhai"  not the subsequent onces
[23:21:58] <lemonsparrow> macmartine: tw2113 not been using fiddle often and sorry for messting js up with html
[23:21:59] <macmartine> can you not narrow it down? what does the form and all these other js includes have anything to do with it?
[23:22:24] <macmartine> and your initial question is lost
[23:23:49] <macmartine> i think your fiddle could be cut down to http://jsfiddle.net/6gQZ9/2/
[23:24:43] <tw2113> relative urls on any external scripts won't help you at all either
[23:26:01] <macmartine> lemonsparrow: include query and you're good http://jsfiddle.net/6gQZ9/3/
[23:28:06] <lemonsparrow> macmartine: document.ready is not getting called
[23:29:49] <macmartine> lemonsparrow: read up http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:30:28] <lemonsparrow> macmartine: I mean the problem is that it isnt getting invoked in my code
[23:30:56] <macmartine> lemonsparrow: like i said, read up. do you know what $(function() { does?
[23:31:23] <coldhead> in your jsfiddle you have the code set to run "onload"
[23:31:30] <coldhead> if you change it to nowrap http://jsfiddle.net/6gQZ9/5/
[23:31:37] <coldhead> it does what you expect
[23:31:54] <coldhead> it's better not to use $(function)
[23:32:03] <coldhead> $(document).ready() is much more readable
[23:32:28] <macmartine> that's arguable. but $(function() { is the same as ready()
[23:32:50] <coldhead> the non ready form is "magic"
[23:32:55] <lemonsparrow> coldhead: ok
[23:33:03] <coldhead> document ready refers to the document being ready
[23:33:07] <macmartine> it's the query form. don't use jquery then
[23:33:10] <coldhead> i will argue with anyone who disputs that
[23:33:16] <coldhead> with knives if necessary
[23:33:20] <Gazpacho> coldhead: that's not much of an explanation
[23:33:40] <coldhead> the explanation is i have spent years telling people they mean the same thing
[23:33:41] * SinnerNyx throws down some knives..
[23:33:43] <SinnerNyx> the stage has been set
[23:33:52] <coldhead> if everyone just used .ready() i wouldn't have to explain
[23:33:56] <coldhead> and could do more useful things
[23:34:02] <coldhead> like teach monkeys to knife fight
[23:34:04] <Gazpacho> coldhead: you could do it in the afterlife, it still wouldn't explain anything
[23:35:42] <coldhead> suffice to say, everyone who is right agrees with me
[23:35:57] <SinnerNyx> I also prefer the $(function) overload. Depending on who you talk to you'd also need to explain what $(document).ready() does.. Not sure that you needing to explain a different variation necessarily gives you the time to teach such important concepts to hapless creatures..
[23:36:09] <SinnerNyx> coldhead: of course, that goes without saying.
[23:36:13] <tw2113> coldhead, i am having way too much fun with greasemonkey
[23:36:23] <coldhead> SinnerNyx: document ready is at least googleable
[23:36:35] <SinnerNyx> coldhead: VERY true. Hadn't thought of that.
[23:37:06] <coldhead> i use $() all the time but if it's code anyone else is ever going to see i change it to the full form
[23:37:22] <SinnerNyx> coldhead: but... I still like $(function) better. Would it make you feel better if from now on I add a comment that $(function) == $(document).ready(function)?
[23:37:35] <coldhead> hahaha no that's probably not helpful either
[23:37:43] <coldhead> let's just never collaborate on a project and we're good
[23:38:02] <SinnerNyx> coldhead: awww. I'm sad now
[23:38:22] <coldhead> let's do it my way when we collaborate then
[23:38:28] <coldhead> on account of it's the right way
[23:38:28] <SinnerNyx> deal
[23:38:32] <SinnerNyx> of course
[23:38:32] <lemonsparrow> coldhead: tw2113 : simple fiddle with my problem http://jsfiddle.net/mzzvg/3/ $.ready is not working here... thats my problem
[23:38:54] <coldhead> leftmost pane, lemonsparrow
[23:38:59] <coldhead> where it says onload
[23:39:10] <coldhead> that is wrapping your .ready in a .load
[23:39:14] <coldhead> use no wrapper
[23:39:25] <coldhead> and uh, don't have html in your JS pane
[23:39:29] <coldhead> jsfiddle hates that
[23:39:36] <coldhead> and to a lesser extent, i hate that
[23:39:49] <tw2113> he's doing better than he was before coldhead
[23:39:54] <SinnerNyx> ya, i don't think the JS is being parsed at all because of that.
[23:40:02] <coldhead> aren't we all though, tw2113
[23:40:10] <coldhead> me especially because i've had 3 beers
[23:40:18] <coldhead> and it's not even 9am
[23:40:18] <lemonsparrow> coldhead: left mode pane is set to onload http://jsfiddle.net/mzzvg/3/
[23:40:21] <tw2113> i don't see html in the js panel in http://jsfiddle.net/mzzvg/3/
[23:40:26] <tw2113> just the script tag
[23:40:31] <Eviltwin> ...
[23:40:37] <coldhead> you don't consider that html, tw2113?
[23:40:37] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: that's irrelevant remove the <script ...> and </script>
[23:40:40] <tw2113> lemonsparrow, he'said to unset that part
[23:40:40] <coldhead> you're off the team
[23:40:40] <Eviltwin> A script tag is not JavaScript
[23:40:42] <Eviltwin> It's HTML
[23:41:05] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/MZZvg/4/
[23:41:14] <tw2113> a dingo ate my html
[23:41:17] <tw2113> yes that's a fun animal to me
[23:42:27] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: also you're trying to bind an eventlistener to #address, but I don't see any elements with an id of address..
[23:43:03] <Eviltwin> You guys want to see one of the most hilariously overblown fiddles? (made by me)
[23:43:57] <tw2113> is it more funny than Dane Cook?
[23:44:07] <tw2113> setting the bar low here
[23:44:27] <coldhead> hook us up, Eviltwin
[23:44:35] <Eviltwin> I suppose absurd would be a better word than hilarious
[23:44:37] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/YaxxG/show/
[23:44:44] <tw2113> still better than Dane
[23:44:54] <Eviltwin> I wanted to demo how pipeline vs parallelism speed up a process
[23:45:10] <Eviltwin> With a washer and dryer as a physical metaphor
[23:45:20] <coldhead> hahahahahah
[23:45:24] <Eviltwin> 490 lines of JS
[23:45:30] <SinnerNyx> Eviltwin: I love it!
[23:45:32] <coldhead> you should be banned from jQuery for this, evil twin
[23:45:38] <tw2113> spiffy
[23:46:00] <Eviltwin> What I should be banned for is how much code I copy-pasted in it rather than breaking out to a function
[23:46:16] <coldhead> "my events are bound to content i added via ajax so can i please have 500 lines of washing machine code?"
[23:46:23] <coldhead> everyone will expect this now, Eviltwin!
[23:46:45] <Eviltwin> There are 26 calls to $.Deferred() in the code
[23:46:48] <lemonsparrow> hi'
[23:46:57] <Eviltwin> And 34 to .animate()
[23:46:58] <lemonsparrow> coldhead: tw2113 hi got disconnected
[23:47:00] <coldhead> you're a freak, Eviltwin
[23:47:13] <coldhead> welcome back, lemonsparrow
[23:47:16] <coldhead> we missed you
[23:47:19] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[23:47:22] <lemonsparrow> tw2113: ping me ur fiddle link that u just posted before I got disconnected
[23:47:56] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: also you're trying to bind an eventlistener to #address, but I don't see any elements with an id of address..
[23:48:40] <tw2113> take yours, and add a 4 instead of a 3
[23:49:01] <lemonsparrow> SinnerNyx: tw2113 http://jsfiddle.net/MZZvg/4/
[23:49:14] <tw2113> yes that's it
[23:49:58] <lemonsparrow> SinnerNyx: right.. textarea can be given id too right
[23:50:25] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: it has an id it's just not "address" :P.
[23:50:44] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: and yes, any html element can be given an id
[23:51:00] <lemonsparrow> SinnerNyx: yeah I renamed id to address
[23:51:01] <lemonsparrow> SinnerNyx: :)
[23:51:08] <lemonsparrow> SinnerNyx: but still doesnt give me the alert http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/MZZvg/6/
[23:51:09] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: that'll do the trick I think :)
[23:51:35] * tw2113 goes back to pseudo-ignoring people on plentyoffish.com
[23:52:05] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: I just went to the fiddle you linked and I get the alert when I click on the "Address" textarea
[23:52:17] <lemonsparrow> SinnerNyx: tw2113 also for second alert "How are you" in the applet I get a message saying prevent this page from creating additional dialogues.. what's that ?
[23:52:32] <tw2113> a way to exit out of alert hell
[23:52:38] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: that's chrome helping your users who are annoyed by alerts from your page
[23:52:44] <tw2113> firefox too
[23:52:51] <lemonsparrow> SinnerNyx: tw2113 yeah its working thanks :)
[23:53:04] <SinnerNyx> lemonsparrow: there's no way to block that, and you shouldn't want to anyways. You really should not be using alerts to communicate with your end users anyway
[23:53:19] <lemonsparrow> SinnerNyx: ok
[23:58:01] <coldhead> great work guys, let's take a short break
