[07:51:26] <Ziberius> hello
[07:52:11] <Ziberius> I have a problem with a sequence of functions, when I run the last function without parameters it works great, but if I add parameters the order is not sequential. Am I supposed to pass parameters some other way?
[07:52:18] <Ziberius> I will post jsfiddle links one seconed
[07:52:44] <Ziberius> this works: https://jsfiddle.net/Ziberius/ukwqd5xb/73/
[07:54:22] <Ziberius> this does not: https://jsfiddle.net/Ziberius/svyp29c6/1/
[07:54:31] <Ziberius> any tips are greatly appreciated
[07:56:21] <Cork> Ziberius: functionName is a reference functionName() executes the function
[07:56:35] <Cork> so you can't give a function as refernce and give it parameters at the same time
[07:56:47] <Cork> the solution is to wrap the function call in an anonymous function
[07:56:57] <Cork> (funciton() { qux() })
[07:58:02] <Ziberius> that seems to work,thanx man! :-D
[11:55:01] <Levin^2> hello
[11:55:15] <Levin^2> I can't find anything related on google
[11:55:55] <Levin^2> I need to make a form validation, where it should be able to use a blacklist to allow or disallow the form submition
[11:56:33] <Levin^2> if a person type certain words in a textarea
[11:56:47] <Levin^2> how can I do that?
[11:57:09] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to approach that.
[11:58:04] <robertmaxrees> easiest would be to break the two into 2 separate arrays, then use array.every or array.some or w/e to see if one contains a word from the other.
[11:59:42] <robertmaxrees> Levin^2
[12:09:34] <Levin^2> hm
[12:10:01] <Levin^2> let me try that
[12:12:46] <robertmaxrees> have your array of bad words and .some() on it, checking if theInput.toLowerCase().val().indexOf(theWord) > -1
[12:12:50] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to do it.
[12:21:53] <GeekMonkey> Hey all.... I wonder if someone could help me with the youtube iframe api... this example https://jsfiddle.net/wzalazar/72NYY/ loads multiple videos but I am wondering if I could do a .each function do it gets a data attribute from the div and loads the video
[12:50:31] <GeekMonkey> Is there any way to unmute the videos on play https://codepen.io/rsmm/pen/2ce6461985529f96fdfa33d990ab1340?editors=1010
[13:07:10] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference  there is an unmute method.  GeekMonkey
[13:08:16] <taplar> also known as the "if you auto unmute my videos I'm going to write a script to remove your videos from your webpage" function
[13:08:21] <GeekMonkey> taplar I tried that.... but it wont play the video
[13:15:58] <GeekMonkey> there is an interation on the site to show that you want to play the video
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> also: lots of browsers block autoplay and auto unmute functionality.
[14:04:22] <anikras> Hi, I have script with dummy ajax function and 2 html (index and result ) I have on my index script tag to jquery
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> cool
[14:04:49] <anikras> in  my console I can see: TypeError: $(...).read is not a function
[14:04:50] <robertmaxrees> (huh?)
[14:04:50] <taplar> "dummy ajax function"?
[14:04:54] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> also: sounds like you don't have jquery loaded before you try to run your code.
[14:05:16] <robertmaxrees> or noconflict mode is on.
[14:05:23] <taplar> "read" isn't a jQuery method?
[14:05:30] <anikras>  $(document).read(function() {
[14:05:34] <taplar> ready
[14:05:36] <taplar> so a typo
[14:05:41] <robertmaxrees> oh hahhahahah
[14:05:42] <robertmaxrees> taplar++++
[14:06:26] <anikras> oh my god !!, sorry is ready
[14:06:58] <robertmaxrees> fixed?
[14:09:46] <taplar> then(() => robertWaitsForResponse);
[14:10:12] <robertmaxrees> anikras
[14:10:42] <anikras> robertmaxrees, Yes, it's fixed, sorry, it's my fault
[14:11:16] <robertmaxrees> rad
[14:11:23] <taplar> function robertWaitsForResponse (response) { console.log('rad'); }
[14:12:35] <robertmaxrees> const responseHandler = (req, res) => console.log('rad');
