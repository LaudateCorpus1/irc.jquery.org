[00:52:52] <CaffeinatedSky> They should rename this to #afk
[00:55:15] <CaffeinatedSky> Or #joinandleave
[00:58:41] <henry35> wow....
[00:58:47] <henry35> lots of people here
[00:59:42] <VeXii^zZzZ> :)
[00:59:44] <henry35> Anyone alive here?
[01:00:10] <VeXii> yeah we just dont respond well to wow... ;)
[01:00:27] <henry35> i didnt expected
[01:00:43] <henry35> more as 10 years ago i was on an irc channel
[01:01:57] <VeXii> if it works why change it? :)
[01:02:47] <henry35> i just see that there is a channel for jquerymobile,i should go in there couse my troubles are with jqm
[01:06:57] <henry35> what program is recomended currently for irc (i'm via the web now)
[01:09:20] <GoSox> So i'm using .attr('src',$url); to set the source url of an <iframe>. And it's totally working, but, there seems to be an odd delay between setting the source, and the browser actually loading that source. Doesn't seem to be instant
[01:09:53] <VeXii> the internet arnt instant
[01:10:21] <GoSox> ok what i'm saying is theres a delay between starting to load the framed content
[01:10:30] <GoSox> if i load the framed url directly, it essentially is instant
[01:11:25] <GoSox> wow so the delay is this: In safari, after you set the src of an iframe with jQuery, the frame won't load until you move the mouse!
[01:11:44] <VeXii> wow
[01:12:01] <VeXii> and you cant trigger it somhow whith code then?
[01:12:17] <GoSox> i dunno
[01:17:41] <poppiez> hi guys, I'm using a single image object to test if images have been loaded. this is what the code looks like: http://pastie.org/private/488ltlp27agkh9d5u52p6a. 'this.complete' seems to be true after I've loaded the first image for future images. it just says true all the time. how can I reset my image object so that I don't have to create a new one each time? thx!
[01:41:01] <poppiez> anyone in here?
[01:57:18] <milligan> yep poppiez
[02:00:26] <jacky123> i guess there is a race condition issue happening with me
[02:04:34] <jacky123> http://pastie.org/2891974 - alert on line 20 is executed before the one on line 15, due to which line 21 evaluates to false. someone help me out.
[02:06:31] <cobexer> jacky123: thats because $.post is sent asynchronously
[02:07:11] <cobexer> jacky123: just move the second $.post into the success handler of the first one
[02:07:50] <jacky123> hmm, cant do that, cause that one needs to execute on other conditions oo
[02:07:51] <jacky123> too*
[02:08:02] <jacky123> maybe i should put the second $.post inside a function and call that ? hmm
[02:08:36] <cobexer> jacky123: yes
[02:12:12] <jacky123> whats up with this american cencorship ?
[02:13:20] <poppiez> hi guys, I'm using a single image object to test if images have been loaded. this is what the code looks like: http://pastie.org/private/488ltlp27agkh9d5u52p6a.

[02:31:54] <MariusKarthaus> Hi, I'm building a webapp and I wanted to preload some stuff during the time it takes the user to type in his login/password so that the app will load faster afterwards. I'm seeing a lot of 'smart' libs out there that can do al kinds of fancy dependency loading etc. But wouldn't a simple set of  $.ajax(url); statements be just as good ?
[02:44:03] <amirite> anyone know the proper way to get the viewport height in android browser
[02:44:55] <Zerxer> hm no lesscss channel

[03:16:16] <solsTiCe> hi. I was trying to use ajax caching with ifModified: true, but it does not work. only with an etag. I need to set too Last-Modified header ?
[03:29:07] <MariusKarthaus> solsTiCe: if you do not set the last modified header the browser will not know what to ask for in the if-modfied-since header. So yes you need to set this header. Also on the server you need to check for this header and if you want it to use the cached version you need to repond with a header 304 not modified
[03:29:55] <solsTiCe> if I use cache-control and etag that should be enough, no ?
[03:30:07] <solsTiCe> cache-control with a max-age
[03:31:52] <MariusKarthaus> solsTiCe: headers you are going to need for working caching:  Last-Modified,Expires (set to how long you want the cache to not-check-again), etag (watch out for apache mod_deflate that will apeend -gzip to your etag) and  Cache-Control: max-age
[03:32:18] <MariusKarthaus> s/appeend/append
[03:34:08] <minna> Im trying to make an if statement that checks if either of two values are true, do this... but i seem to be doing something wrong. Shouldnt it be like this? if(elementSelected == "thisvalue" || elementSelected == "orthisvalue")
[03:35:12] <MariusKarthaus> minna: yes that should be correct. but in javascript things that 'look' the same 'are' not always the same
[03:35:24] <MariusKarthaus> {foo:'bar'}!={foo:'bar'}
[03:35:44] <minna> Hm, i don't get it.
[03:36:01] <minna> foo bar is not foo bar?
[03:38:02] <minna> MariusKarthaus: I now made an alert that says true and false, it returns true, but it seem to run the else statement anyway.
[03:39:13] <MariusKarthaus> minna: yes {foo:'bar'} is 'an object', but the second time your create 'an object' you create a different object. even if they look the same. If you compare them using == or === they will *not* be the same
[03:40:59] <MariusKarthaus> minna: so it depends on that you are trying to compare. If it is simple types like a number or a string. You statement will work. But if you are comparing objects you will need to do more to find out if the objects are equal
[03:41:34] <MariusKarthaus> sorry for my bad english, i'm not at my best today..
[03:41:34] <Denis_A> Hello. Can you help me? I have such function
[03:41:34] <Denis_A> 	$('a', 'div#content').has('h2').click(function(){
[03:41:34] <Denis_A> 		$(this).next('div').show().addClass('shown').siblings('div.shown').hide().removeClass('shown').prev('h2').wrap('<a href="#"></a>');
[03:41:34] <Denis_A> 		$(this).children('h2').unwrap();
[03:41:34] <Denis_A> 		return false;
[03:41:35] <Denis_A> 	});
[03:41:35] <Denis_A> which create new 'a' elements. But it does not handle new 'a' elements with initial selector 'a'. What should I do that function to handle new elements?
[03:41:35] <minna> I'm only comparing strings
[03:41:43] <MariusKarthaus> Denis_A: use pastebin
[03:41:51] <minna> Denis_A: NO Denis_A No!
[03:41:56] <DCC_SEND> I think you're all a bunch of rappity yappity yassholes
[03:42:02] <DCC_SEND> When I ask my question:
[03:42:06] <DCC_SEND> How do I use <href> to load a local icon for <IconStyle>?  This is what I have for <Icon> A custom Icon. In <IconStyle>, the only child element of <Icon> is <href>: <href>: An HTTP address or a local file specification used to load an icon.  The KML specs don't tell how to use a local image in <href>
[03:42:17] <DCC_SEND> NO ONE ANSWERS!
[03:42:33] <DCC_SEND> yeah you stupid fuckheads
[03:43:01] <minna> DCC_SEND: If you expect someone do to all you'r work, hire someone.. don't come into a channel and complain.
[03:43:07] <MariusKarthaus> DCC_SEND: wow, just wow...
[03:43:08] <minna> Then you will never get any help.
[03:43:31] <minna> This channel is for learning and helping, nothing else.
[03:43:32] <DCC_SEND> Yeah, well I have to fight hard for my information because of newbies like you
[03:43:37] <DCC_SEND> Back in the late 1990s people actually SHARED information
[03:43:56] <minna> Back in the 90
[03:44:03] <DCC_SEND> When you could find something on the web\
[03:44:16] <minna> This is 2011, go build a time machine if it does not suit you.
[03:44:25] <DCC_SEND> Now, stupid assholes use some no-name language like Jquery, or AJAX, instead of the official Java 2.0
[03:44:41] <minna> DCC_SEND: http://eloquentjavascript.net
[03:44:53] <minna> jquery IS javascript
[03:44:54] <DCC_SEND> I want to know why assholes like you, minna, don't help anyone... I mean it's not only you... but EVERYONE.  And there are 1 billion internet users compared with 110 million
[03:44:57] <MariusKarthaus> DCC_SEND: I do not have your question in my screen when did you ask it? al least more than an hour ago. And you complain that I dont answer your question... dude I wasn't even online

[03:45:46] * Anime sighs.
[03:45:58] <MariusKarthaus> thanks
[03:46:16] <Denis_A> i explain below my code. function creates new elements. How to make that this function handle events of new elements?
[03:46:18] <minna> Wow.. i have never seen anything like that in this channel.
[03:46:35] <minna> Denis_A: can you create a fiddle?
[03:46:47] <Anime> btw, anyone knows of a jquery highlighter for notepad++? couldn't find one, only saw people talking about one they made or something but never links for it
[03:47:40] <minna> Anime: that would be nice, i'll help you google
[03:47:48] <Denis_A> what is fiddle? I know english bad.
[03:48:12] <coldhead> bot-t: tell DCC_SEND I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU
[03:48:12] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[03:48:17] <coldhead> ?p @ Denis_A
[03:48:17] <bot-t> Denis_A, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:49:54] <minna> Anime: There does not seem to exist one, i could only find one for dreamweaver
[03:50:10] <MariusKarthaus> minna: sorry I forgot about your compare question.  Are you sure that your 'elementSelected' is a String?
[03:50:23] <Anime> :-|
[03:50:42] <Anime> i also did try searching with no avail :(
[03:50:54] <DCC_SEND> oh yeah, http://pastebin.com/SaLJEhGg

[03:51:00] <DCC_SEND> So minna
[03:51:05] <DCC_SEND> minna: I want to understand the psychology of a newbie
[03:51:19] <DCC_SEND> Forget me?  How can you forget me when I am typing now
[03:51:47] <DCC_SEND> 88-223-58-21.meganet.lt
[03:52:33] <DCC_SEND> Since the year 2000, I've noticed HORDES of newbies, in much larger waves of people comparable to the 1995 wave of newbies
[03:52:38] <DCC_SEND> I'm talking about Internet newbies here
[03:53:12] <Denis_A> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/KdXMf/ I threw out all unnecessary
[03:53:16] <minna> MariusKarthaus: It should be a string, it's the attribute "for" from a button. I don't get it, it works if i don't reload the browser, but it resets when i reload.
[03:53:16] <DCC_SEND> Most were from foreign countries, meaning they didn't have something like AOL to keep them in a newbie world for a few years
[03:53:22] <DCC_SEND> aah well

[03:54:35] <CaffeinatedSky> Gline ftw

[03:55:33] <CaffeinatedSky> Line*
[03:56:18] <minna> MariusKarthaus: I'll just make a fiddle, i wan't to understand this.
[03:57:15] <MariusKarthaus> minna: I'll be back in a few minutes going to get a smoke
[03:57:38] <Denis_A> Can anybody reply my question?  Code on http://jsfiddle.net/KdXMf/ Function creates new elements. How to make that this function handle events of new elements?
[03:59:56] <solsTiCe> MariusKarthaus: from what I undestand you don't need all those headers. some are http 1.0 others http 1.1 and some are conflictiong with each other
[04:00:03] <minna> Denis_A: I can't figure out what the code is supposed to do. You wrap the h2 tag in a link tag, hide the p tag. then what?
[04:06:51] <Denis_A> minna, I hide all divs, wrap all h2 in a link. Then when user cicks to wrapped link, next div shows, h2 unwraps and previosly showed div hides, closest h2 wraps again, this creates a new link element.
[04:06:51] <AzMoo> Hey guys, is there a simple way to get the .width() of an inline or floated element?
[04:08:58] <Anime> http://api.jquery.com/width/ ?
[04:09:22] <MariusKarthaus> solsTiCe: the quick and dirty answer is that you can set them all and all browsers that I have seen will act correctly. The real answer is that you do need to check what kind of browser is talking what version of http and work around quirks.
[04:09:33] <nospinzy> what command do you use in irc to list the users in a room
[04:09:33] <Denis_A> minna, And function does not work with these new link elements on click.
[04:09:34] <AzMoo> Anime: It doesn't work on inline or floated elements.
[04:10:25] <Anime> hm o_o
[04:11:18] <MariusKarthaus> Denis_A: you are making it too hard on yourself. You are re-creating a <a href> tag each time. because of that the *new* href does not have the click function attached to it
[04:11:44] <Anime> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2126488/find-the-width-of-a-left-floated-list-and-apply-to-wrapper-div-to-center-it-usin
[04:11:49] <AzMoo> Anime: it does work if the width is explicitly set.
[04:12:06] <MariusKarthaus> Denis_A: I advise you not to turn the a href into the H2 and back, instead keep the original href, create a new h2 and go from there
[04:12:08] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: hi, do you know how to pass jquery data to php server?
[04:12:14] <Anime> ah..
[04:13:01] <MariusKarthaus> a4erfdj875tfj: look at $.ajax function. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:13:36] <minna> MariusKarthaus: Something else is messing with my select, im gonna try and find the reason, thanks for helping :-)
[04:14:24] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: how do i capture the ajax call to php server?
[04:14:59] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: if ($_SERVER[...] == ajax) {do something}
[04:15:17] <MariusKarthaus> a4erfdj875tfj: use type='POST' in your ajax call in jquery and in the script that gets called look in the $_POST variable
[04:15:49] <MariusKarthaus> minna: yw
[04:16:21] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: but how do i capture the ajax call. i remember it to be something like this? if ($_SERVER[...] == ajax) {do something}
[04:16:57] <Denis_A> MariusKarthaus, The problem is that when i create new elements link or h2, old event handlers no longer work for them. How make it work with new elements created on the fly?
[04:17:51] <MariusKarthaus> I'm not sure what you mean but my guess is you are looking for $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] == 'XMLHttpRequest'
[04:18:37] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: yes that looks familiar... but its not complete right?
[04:20:50] <MariusKarthaus> a4erfdj875tfj: personally I think you should not rely on the way the request is done to decide on what to do. (never depend on something the client does) Instead check on the serverside if you have a $_POST that makes sense and pase accordingly
[04:21:30] <AzMoo> Update. .width() reports proper values on floated elements in firefox but not chrome or safari.
[04:21:37] <OafSlayer921> SO SHITHEAD
[04:22:19] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: not fully understand. can you provide some sample code to show how to check on the server side so i get what you mean?

[04:43:09] <MariusKarthaus> a4erfdj875tfj: yea, I depend on the variables in $_POST to know how the server needs to respond. I do not know how to explain better
[04:43:25] <MariusKarthaus> you asked how to port data to the server, this is what I do
[04:43:51] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: i will show you some more code. 1 minute.
[04:47:39] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: i google and found this. http://jsfiddle.net/wN6FB/ <-- this is what is usually done. why r u saying its less reliable?
[04:49:00] <MariusKarthaus> a4erfdj875tfj: it depends on the browser setting the correct header.
[04:49:00] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: are you saying the http variable named 'HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH' is not supported by all browsers?
[04:49:55] <MariusKarthaus> a4erfdj875tfj: i'm saying that I never depend on any 'good behaviour' from the client side. maybe all browsers do support it... until there is one that does not
[04:50:06] <Woet> if(isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] == "XMLHttpRequest"){ is fine. all browsers support it.
[04:50:30] <a4erfdj875tfj> Woet: MariusKarthaus doesn't like it for some reason and i can't understand why.
[04:50:42] <Woet> MariusKarthaus; if a new browser arrives and it doesn't support it, i'm pretty sure you have a lot more to worry about then this single standard.
[04:51:28] <MariusKarthaus> i'm not saying that isn't. It is a choice I make in all my code that I just try to depend at least as possible on the good behaviour of the client.
[04:51:47] <Woet> right
[04:52:04] <Woet> you don't use jquery then I assume? it requires a lot of good behavior of the javascript engine.
[04:53:07] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: the client has no control over http variables.... i don't follow your argument.
[04:53:21] <MariusKarthaus> Woet: that was not the point i was trying to make. but this discussion is getting out of hand so i'll just stop now. His qeustion was how to get data to PHP using ajax and I told him how I do it.
[04:53:55] <ch3> Can delegate be used to call a method on new elements when they are added to the DOM or is this still a use case of livequery?
[04:54:19] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: no worries, lets move on to a different question. in your code, don't you need to json_decode on the php server side on the dta?
[04:58:35] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus, Woet: don't you need to decode the data on the server-side here http://pastebin.com/tXFKPrC6
[05:02:14] <MariusKarthaus> a4erfdj875tfj: why dont you try it and find out. You will learn more from that than if I just tell you
[05:03:29] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: i want to know when u need to use json encode/decode. u didnt use it in your example.
[05:05:38] <a4erfdj875tfj> MariusKarthaus: you teach me and i teach you. it will be quicker for us both.
[05:06:21] <a4erfdj875tfj> anyone want to join this conversation on how and when to use json in this example http://pastebin.com/tXFKPrC6
[05:12:08] <emx> this causes a parser error when retreiving data that should be parsed as json. why? : {a:"revalidate",list:["emailAddress"]}
[05:13:20] <a4erfdj875tfj> emx: thats not json
[05:14:34] <botfather> emx its {"a": "revalidate", "list": ["email"] }
[05:16:23] <a4erfdj875tfj> botfather: do you need to json encode jquery data for sending to server if its a string?
[05:18:54] <emx> a4erfdj875tfj, you mean it has to be strict ecma. got it.
[05:19:14] <a4erfdj875tfj> emx: huh? what do you mean?
[05:19:45] <emx> {a: data} <- not strict | {'a': data} <- strict
[05:20:19] <a4erfdj875tfj> emx: {"a": "data"} <- strict
[05:20:28] <botfather> a4erfdj875tfj: a string is valid JSON i think
[05:20:34] <emx> if data was not an object, yes
[05:21:04] <botfather> but wont hurt if you encode it
[05:21:07] <a4erfdj875tfj> emx: you got a reference for that?
[05:22:14] <a4erfdj875tfj> botfather: i was just told that whenever you pass jquery data to php and vice versa you have to json encode/decode because they are different languages.
[05:22:33] <emx> a4erfdj875tfj, not a reference, but a proof: use the console of your browser and see if there is a parsing error when entering e.g. var s = { a: 'some text' }; see what s is.
[05:25:30] <minna> MariusKarthaus: The problem was caused by a cookie plugin variable that didn't use a selector. var resetCookie = $.cookie('menu-select', null);
[05:26:42] <MariusKarthaus> and you were trying to test if that cookie ==="string" ?
[05:26:53] <minna> MariusKarthaus: No. Just reseting the cookie.
[05:27:17] <minna> MariusKarthaus: The variable is executed, even though the variable is not printed out anywhere.
[05:27:25] <MariusKarthaus> minna: O hmm then I problably don't recall your original question correctly. but good that you figured it out
[05:27:47] <minna> MariusKarthaus: I checked the cookie plugin, and this seem to be how it's supposed to work. :-S http://plugins.jquery.com/files/jquery.cookie.js.txt
[05:27:49] <MariusKarthaus> minna: o yea that was it
[05:28:00] <minna> But it's not supposed to execute the variable
[05:28:33] <minna> may be a 1.7 bug, i would need to test this. I checked another script that has this plugin, and there the problem does not exist, the variables work as expected.
[05:32:01] <MariusKarthaus> minna: I'm not quite sure what you were expecting, but if the statement resetCookie=$.cookie('foo'null)l is encountered by the parser I'd say the expected result is that the cookie foo is set to null and the variable resetCookie contains null
[05:32:55] <minna> Hm.
[05:33:08] <minna> I guess it was i who didn't understand variables properly
[05:33:36] <minna> If it where a function in a variable, it would be working different?
[05:33:43] <MariusKarthaus> yes
[05:34:32] <MariusKarthaus> maybe you want this : var reset=function(cookieName){$.cookie(cookieName,null);}
[05:36:31] <MariusKarthaus> minna: var alert=alert('foo'); will still alert 'foo' immediately , even though you assign the result of that to a variable
[05:36:55] <MariusKarthaus> o maybe not use alert as a variable name :P
[05:36:57] <minna> That was not a netsplit, that was a netbomb.
[05:37:51] <minna> MariusKarthaus: lol
[05:39:26] <Iszak> Someone needs to update the title for jQuery Mobile.
[05:41:04] <minna> MariusKarthaus: So putting an element selector into a variable is not how it's supposed to be used?
[05:41:11] <minna> MariusKarthaus: Variables can't hold objects?
[05:41:23] <minna> Oh... the cookie is not an object
[05:41:24] <Iszak> of course variables can hold objects.
[05:41:52] <minna> Now i get why it craps out.
[05:50:20] <sorrymyeng> hi everybody, is it correct to write jQuery(function($) { var cookieList = function(cookieName) { ....... ?
[05:51:13] <dabear> sorrymyeng: it is not incorrect
[05:51:21] <dabear> what are you actually trying to do?
[05:55:05] <sorrymyeng> im trying to wrap my function with jQuery, becouse i using .noConflict. that works if i write it directly before place where i call it, but dont work if i move it to my_library.js file. i think there are some mistake somewhere
[05:56:58] <sorrymyeng> alert placed after function description is called but then when i call that function - fireBug says: %%function_name%% is not defined
[05:59:55] <sorrymyeng> dabear: any ideas?
[06:02:08] <sorrymyeng> dabear: i think it is becouse i define function in one "jQuery(function($) { " and call her from function defined in other such wrapped...
[06:03:54] <dabear> sorrymyeng: (function($){  use $ as normal here })(jQuery.noConflict())
[06:04:18] <pasigydziau> Hello, i was reading this http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring But i didin't found patern how private methods should be defined, may anyone know good article about this?
[06:05:16] <dabear> pasigydziau: http://jsfiddle.net/qvvrp/
[06:06:55] <aleray> it seems like the grid option for draggable and resizable is defined relatively to the element concerned... is it possible to snap on an absolute grid instead?
[06:07:17] <pasigydziau> dabear, ok but that function doesn't share same scope, so i should pass this as parameter to access same scope as plugin
[06:07:24] <pasigydziau> this would be good solution?
[06:30:33] <nimred> don't you know a way to autosave datas from form/imput ... ?
[06:30:56] <Woet> nimred: ajax.
[06:32:28] <nimred> Woet: which way ?
[06:32:40] <Woet> nimred: .. which possible ways are there?
[06:34:34] <nimred> i don't know. Tell me :)
[06:46:19] <crab> set a timer, do a POST
[06:47:30] <Slartibart> Hi. Does anyone here see any obvious improvements that could be done to this function? http://pastebin.com/dpfPiBWE
[06:48:48] <Slartibart> According to Chromium profiler half of my code's time was spent in that function. If I'm reading things right..
[06:51:03] <nimred> crab: what do you mean ?
[06:52:09] <crab> nimred: if you want to save every n seconds, use setTimer(n, function () { ...post data to server here... })
[06:52:26] <crab> slarti: what is that function for?
[06:53:27] <nimred> crab: i want to save when changes are made
[06:53:49] <Slartibart> crab: There are two tables on top of eachother, and this function adjusts column widths so that they are the same for both tables.
[06:53:54] <crab> nimred: so use a .change() callback then.
[06:55:27] <nimred> crab: i do not know jquery
[06:55:48] <nimred> isn't there any library that already do what i need ?
[06:56:25] <crab> nimred: no idea.
[06:56:36] <crab> you should ask google.
[06:57:19] <crab> 5.47 million results for "jquery form auto save plugin"
[06:57:49] <nimred> crab: i found this : http://rikrikrik.com/jquery/autosave/
[06:58:11] <crab> great.
[06:58:24] <nimred> but it only saves data for one page
[06:58:53] <nimred> when you have multiple pages with exactly same form and navigating from one page to another you loses datas...
[06:59:07] <nimred> or you would have to save datas for each page
[06:59:13] <nimred> i do not want this
[06:59:26] <nimred> i need datas to be exactly the same from one page to another
[07:01:36] <nimred> crab: do you understand what i mean ?
[07:02:53] <crab> nimred: yes, sort of.
[07:03:37] <crab> i don't know what to do about it, though.
[07:10:03] <bedspax> hi guys
[07:10:08] <bedspax> which is this status?
[07:10:26] <bedspax> http://gyazo.com/9a3da6c7388f3ddc3b96f6bb5d0870a4.png
[07:10:36] <bedspax> I mean the load
[07:10:46] <bedspax> in jquery, how can catch that?
[07:11:20] <tomasm-> anyone here use blueimp's file-upload? I am only able to upload a file once before it says errorThrown=abort. and im not sure how to clear that so it can respond again. any ideas?
[07:22:57] <jexmex> anybody here familiar with jqueryui sortable using connectWith and binding with sortchange?
[07:44:21] <Slartibart> What's the difference between d.extend.attr and d.fn.extend.attr?
[07:45:54] <Slartibart> (From chromium profiler terminology, I'm sur eyou see what it means in jQuery though..)
[07:54:24] <jeffj_> hi
[07:55:26] <jeffj_> I am having trouble getting my first post I don't seem to be validated
[07:55:31] <jeffj_> any ideas
[07:55:46] <jrockjiggz> first post?
[07:55:54] <jeffj_> yes
[07:56:40] <jeffj_> I went to the forum and pried making a post and it won't let me I am trying to find some support
[07:57:42] <phz> has anyone used this https://github.com/Ovea/Socket.IO-Java ?
[07:59:54] <jeffj_> I am trying to work on some JSON stuff and it is my first time working with it
[08:00:19] <jeffj_> anyone know a lot that may be willing to help
[08:04:51] <crab> jeffj: ask away.
[08:05:35] <jeffj_> I seem to be having some issue when I try implementing JSON
[08:05:40] <bedspax> which is this status?
[08:05:42] <bedspax> http://gyazo.com/9a3da6c7388f3ddc3b96f6bb5d0870a4.png
[08:06:18] <jeffj_> I am fairly new to query and it has been ages sinces I used something like this IRC
[08:06:34] <jeffj_> so forgive any stupid mistakes
[08:07:07] <jeffj_> what kind of structure should I expect JSON returns to be in
[08:07:18] <Tant102> A parsed javascript object.
[08:08:07] <jeffj_> so if I send something back like {"Bday":19630918,"extimg":"first"}
[08:08:45] <jeffj_> could you describe the parsed object so that I could add it directly to code
[08:09:09] <Tant102> You would get a object back with the properties/variables Bday and extimg.
[08:09:22] <Tant102> same as var x = {"Bday":19630918,"extimg":"first"}
[08:10:32] <jeffj_> and then from that point I have to break it apart to access the correct structute
[08:11:07] <hightekvagabond> I'm having trouble getting draggable to let me drag an object out of a div with overflow auto on it… I used the appendTo body thing but that didn't help…. what I am I miss? http://jsfiddle.net/hUJap/
[08:11:54] <jeffj_>  I use this
[08:11:57] <jeffj_>   $.getJSON("http://www/imobilizeit.com/jeff/jeff.php?jsoncallback=?",                     function(data) {                         $('#datasrc').text(data);
[08:12:25] <jeffj_>  but I get nothing returning
[08:13:44] <jeffj_> I have a field with datasrc as an ID
[08:14:44] <hightekvagabond> is the script being called from the same domain you are trying to hit jeff?
[08:15:45] <hightekvagabond> and shouldn't www/imobilizeit be www.imobilizeit ?
[08:16:04] <jeffj_> no and that is the weird part I actually have to getJSON calls both to EXTERNAL locations and the first works I thought it may be the getJSONP I had to use but this sort of negates that thought
[08:17:21] <jeffj_> O h  I didn't notice that www/imobilizeit
[08:17:28] <jeffj_> that may be it
[08:17:44] <jeffj_> <---feels stupid
[08:18:09] <hightekvagabond> typos happen man
[08:19:00] <jeffj_> any  know if the forums are working right
[08:19:18] <jeffj_> I signed up but can't post anything
[08:19:50] <jeffj_> I am rebuilding my project now and will see if things change
[08:21:58] <speyburn> umm.. i have a noobish problem, basically i need to open a dialog that has a class of "foo" and whitch data equals to a variable
[08:22:02] <jeffj_> has anyone here joined the query forum
[08:22:02] <speyburn> how can i do that?
[08:23:26] <jeffj_> i meant the jquery forum
[08:26:56] <jeffj_> how can I get a list of commands usable here
[08:28:29] <hightekvagabond> irc command for help is /help
[08:29:54] <jrockjiggz> TIL $(this).submit() can crash ff
[08:32:05] <jeffj_> \help
[08:32:29] <jeffj_> tried that but nothing happens
[08:32:51] <jeffj_>  /help
[08:33:44] <jrockjiggz> jeffj_: press 'F1' on your keyboard
[08:35:34] <jeffj_> i browse here via this link http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#jquery
[08:35:51] <jeffj_> not sure if I need to be accessing it differently or not
[08:36:14] <jeffj_> but those commands don't do anything when I try them
[08:36:30] <jeffj_> F1 or /help do nothing
[08:37:16] <jeffj_> oh well thanks everyone for the help going back to try and figure things out
[08:42:35] <anotherKing> Hello

[08:46:21] <__seth> hey i have a noob question... what is the difference between $.fn.extend(... and just $.extend(....
[08:47:06] <anotherKing> http://asimilia.wordpress.com/2008/12/17/jquery-extend-confusion/ @_seth
[08:47:16] <anotherKing> http://asimilia.wordpress.com/2008/12/17/jquery-extend-confusion/ @__seth
[08:47:37] <__seth> @anotherKing cool thanks i'll check it out
[08:50:52] <speyburn> hi, i have an element like this: <div data-eventid='1' class='delete'> how can i hide it so that the data-eventid equals to a variable?
[08:51:08] <savid> Is jquery going to have any kind of official templating plugin?
[08:52:05] <jrockjiggz> speyburn $('.delete').data('eventid')
[08:52:17] <jrockjiggz> oh i didnt read your question
[08:53:18] <jrockjiggz> speyburn var eventId = $('.delete').hide().data('eventid');   not sure if hide() will work you'll probably have to define it, then hide it
[08:53:35] <jrockjiggz> var eventId = $('.delete').data('eventid');  eventId.remove();
[08:53:47] <jrockjiggz> nope wrong again.. *sigh*
[08:54:46] <__seth> @spreyburn um...something like this $('[data-eventid=' + <variable> + ']').hide(); ...don't know if this will actually work
[08:55:28] <anotherKing> @speyburn not sure what you mean, can you explain in another way?
[08:56:26] <speyburn> anotherKing: sure, umm.. i have a number stored in a variable "foo". I need to hide a div that has a class of "delete" and whitch "data-eventid" equals to that variable
[08:56:58] <speyburn> which*
[08:57:57] <speyburn> $(".delete-confirm[data-eventid='+ id +']").eq(id).hide();
[08:58:00] <speyburn> atm i have it like that
[08:59:30] <speyburn> ... im thinking this all wrong
[09:00:15] <held1> does anyone know how i could read the id value of the last data block in this:
[09:01:07] <held1> http://pastie.org/2893505

[09:22:48] <Dionysius> Hello there. I have an mouseover element on a TD. Now i want to find out, if the cursor is closer to the top border or the bottom border. With the event, I know the current position of the mouse, but how I find a compareable position of the hovering element?
[09:23:11] <Rembane> Dionysius: .offset() or something like that.
[09:24:00] <Dionysius> Thanks a lot! I'll look and try with that.
[09:24:34] <Rembane> Dionysius: No worries.
[09:28:22] <Blazento> hi how would i send a complicated json object over to a server with ajax? i see how i can pass a url with a get request such as url : /index?name=xyz, etc, however i have abstracted out my params and have a json object that looks like fn_params.where.name = 'foo', fn_params.sort.name = "ASC", how can i just send fn_params over the wire?
[09:37:31] <atdiehm_home> is there a way to check for what percentage of an object is viewable?  or something about where it's cut off that I could use?
[09:38:20] <atdiehm_home> I basically want to know that if someone has scrolled, and a picture is just half showing, that I can find out something like $('#obj').visiblePercent() or similar.....
[09:38:34] <atdiehm_home> I assume nothing just like that exists, but I'm trying to think of what I could use to make it...
[09:39:21] <burhan> can someone post an example on how to use .validate() but with custom validator? So some function f(), this should be passed the value of the field, if it returns non-True value, then the validation fails. I can't seem to find this on the docs.
[09:43:31] <burhan> For example here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/addMethod#namemethodmessage is how to add a method, but not sure what the parameters should be to validate()
[09:51:49] <Dionysius> Rembane: It's really good compareable, thank you! (event.pageY, $tr.offset().top, $tr.height())
[09:55:36] <donal> hi all
[09:56:10] <donal> on this page here I'm using a the slideUp effect to delete a table row, but it produces a very unpleasant effect
[09:56:21] <donal> http://summer-festivals.cloudfoundry.com/artistSubscription/list
[09:57:03] <donal> If you delete the Madonna row it seems to work OK, but then when you delete the Radiohead row there's a very noticeable jumping effect as the U2 row is slid into position
[09:57:55] <donal> the function I'm using to delete the row with the slideUp effect is http://pastebin.com/P5sd2jVt
[09:58:23] <donal> deletion is performed by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link (In case that's not obvious)
[10:02:02] <Rembane> Dionysius: That's very nice code. :)
[10:05:53] <donal> does anyone have an alternative proposal for how to delete a table row with an effect
[10:07:27] <Rembane> donal: Don't let the page rescale.
[10:09:16] <donal> how do I do that?
[10:10:32] <edgy> Hi, I read at http://encosia.com/cripple-the-google-cdns-caching-with-a-single-character/ that it's recommened to emit the protocol so //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.0/jquery.min.js should work, but it's not, any idea?
[10:16:10] <nimred> is it possible using jquery to retrieve a piece of html code from one page to another ?
[10:21:38] <KevBurnsJr> I'm trying to use cryptico.js to generate RSA keys using Javascript, but it's CPU intensive and the iPhone keeps throwing Execution Timeout errors. How can I get around this?
[10:23:33] <burhan> ah hah - found my answer in the api :)
[10:24:01] <burhan> KevBurnsJr: use a remote service to get your keys?
[10:24:18] <KevBurnsJr> burhan: that's my last resort
[10:26:05] <tman-> hi there, i've used sliderJS for a carousel and was wondering if anyone;'s had luck modularizing a pause method to it
[10:26:14] <tman-> as there presently isn't one..
[10:26:19] <ag> Hello, does anybody know if the deferred object returned from $.ajax(…) is supposed to call a function set up with .progress( callback )?   It seems my callback is simply ignored.   jQuery-1.7
[10:26:46] <KevBurnsJr> burnhan: I tried doing everything async by chaining the whole thing on setTimeouts but it had no effect on execution timeout.
[10:27:06] <tman-> http://tman.ca/heers/v4 if anyone wants to see.. the pagination is added customly, and i'm trying to figure out how to stop the .slides() from carrying on after a user clikcs on of the divs on the rigth
[10:28:43] <burhan> KevBurnsJr: I'm sorry I don't know much beyond that as I don't do much mobile dev.
[10:30:00] <ag> I am trying to make a file-uploading with progress using jQuery's new Deferred.progress( callback ).  So far the uploading works but the progress callback is never called (it seems).
[10:46:51] <Dionysius> Hello there, how can I check against an empty jQuery object?
[10:47:30] <devaholic> $().length ?
[10:47:49] <Dionysius> ah good point ^^
[10:53:36] <Slartibart> Hi. Has anyone here used chrome developer tool for profiling jquery javascripts? How do I interpret d.fn.extend.attr, d.extend.attr and such lines?
[11:01:43] <Slartibart> Those are about $(), I guess, but I'm not sure about the difference between d.fn.extend.attr and d.extend.attr, f.ex..
[11:06:16] <KarlHungus> i'm using sortable to create drag/drop functionality between lists. i have a button that moves an item from one list to another (just like if you dragged and dropped it). can anyone point me in the right direction to animate that item moving from one list to another?
[11:08:59] <Dionysius> KarlHungus: I don't know exactly, but i would: Take current position of that element, remove from DOM and insert to body with position relative of that position. Then animate to second list using the position of the other list. After end of animation insert to correct DOM
[11:09:33] <Dionysius> hmm.. will just be a try ^^
[11:09:59] <KarlHungus> ok. i'm pretty ignorant of animations in general, but i'll try that out and see where it gets me
[11:10:25] <KarlHungus> technically, its not a button. only an event. but, i dont think that makes any difference
[11:16:28] <ryanneufeld> GREETINGS EARTHINGS
[11:22:14] <nVee> evening! Is there a way to see the page request using jquery?
[11:26:51] <donal2> test
[11:36:16] <donal2> i've a problem with deleting table rows with an effect
[11:36:33] <donal2> you can see the page in action here: summer-festivals.cloudfoundry.com/artistSubscription/list
[11:36:56] <donal2> if you delete the first (madonna) row, it seems to work OK
[11:37:21] <donal2> but if you then delete the second (radiohead) row, there's an unpleasant jumping effect as the U2 row shifts into place
[11:37:49] <donal2> if I remove all the padding from the table cells, it works fine, but then I have no padding
[11:38:37] <donal2> the code I'm using to delete the row is here: http://pastebin.com/gZsMrcFK
[11:40:18] <jrockjiggz> how can i instantiate a plugin onto an element that may not exist yet?
[11:43:50] <nimred> is it possible using jquery to retrieve a piece of html code from one page to another ?
[11:44:15] <klafka1_> so i know :checked would be a selector if a checkbox is checked, but what if i want to just know if the checkbox changed state ?
[11:44:41] <donal2> nimred: no it's not
[11:44:52] <zulax> nimesh, ajax
[11:45:08] <nimred> klafka1_: what do you mean ?
[11:45:23] <klafka1_> wait nvm
[11:45:26] <klafka1_> answered my own question
[11:45:51] <donal2> nimred: you need to use AJAX to download the HTML fragment from the other page that you want to insert
[11:46:00] <donal2> into the current page
[11:46:55] <nimred> klafka1_: are you a bot ?
[11:47:02] <klafka1_> um no
[11:47:50] <zulax> is there some kindof compiler that would convert jquery-ui to jquery-mobile
[11:48:47] <r3x> http://nodefree.net/
[11:48:49] <r3x> :-)
[11:52:48] <Prot> Question: I have an f.Event I get from onBlur({somedata:1}, func..), and I pass the event object to an ajax. When the ajax comes back, the same event object is there, but event.data is null instead event.data.somedata==1, which it was right before the ajax
[11:53:00] <Prot> would an ajax modify an event object that has nothing to do with it?
[11:53:09] <Prot> i can't figure out why event.data becomes null
[11:54:39] <Prot> i know this is happening because right before the ajax call, I set event.data2 = event.data, and on success, event.data2 is my data while event.data is null
[11:55:23] <Prot> maybe its because the event is ending or disposing or something?
[11:56:23] <Fodoj> Hi all
[11:57:15] <jrockjiggz> How would i build a plugin that accepts both based id-named target, and also $(this) when instantiated on a selector
[11:57:50] <Prot> var elm = $(target); if(elm.length==0) elm = $(this)
[11:58:30] <jrockjiggz> thanks
[12:01:01] <guy> https://gist.github.com/05b46493bdc9d7ef14ef
[12:01:13] <guy> why it doesn't find .product or .header but finds .style and .description?
[12:01:50] <ajpiano> guy, those are top-level elements
[12:01:54] <ajpiano> you have to .filter() to get them instead of find
[12:01:59] <guy> I see.
[12:02:04] <guy> I will just rather append it.
[12:02:08] <DanGer> hello guys, anyone using jquery mobile?
[12:03:31] <minna> Hm, how do i make a element selection keep trying to find the element until it returns true?
[12:04:07] <minna> while
[12:04:10] <minna> nvm :)
[12:04:43] <minna> If an element doesn't exist, is that the same as false or is it null?
[12:11:50] <alexxxxxxx123> dojo ftw
[12:13:54] <subone_> How do I stop a page from automatically scrolling to the bottom when I add some data with prepend?
[12:17:19] <ryanneufeld> subone_: it shouldn't be doing that
[12:17:39] <subone_> Well, I'm not doing anything particularly strange that I know of
[12:17:52] <ryanneufeld> can you give me a demo?
[12:17:58] <subone_> um...
[12:18:01] <subone_> one sec
[12:18:06] <subone_> or several
[12:18:08] <subone_> brb
[12:18:35] <ryanneufeld> chances are, you've bound to a click event on an anchor with a hash link
[12:18:47] <ryanneufeld> so it could be doing that
[12:18:53] <ryanneufeld> cause you clicked on a link
[12:19:08] <ryanneufeld> and you may not have done an even.preventDefault or return false
[12:20:24] <ryanneufeld> minna: if you're selector finds nothing you'll get an empty collection
[12:20:31] <ryanneufeld> so length will be 0
[12:20:55] <ryanneufeld> $('.thisDoesntExist').length === 0
[12:21:01] <minna> ryanneufeld: Yes, but how do i make the function delay, then run again until length is 1?
[12:21:24] <ryanneufeld> minna: I would suggest you don't do thyat
[12:21:26] <ryanneufeld> *that
[12:21:37] <minna> I know it will cause a loop.
[12:21:40] <ryanneufeld> Why do you need to keep checking?
[12:21:57] <minna> But that's how livequery does it, so why not do it manually instead of inserting a large plugin
[12:22:10] <minna> other js is inserting data
[12:22:17] <minna> that i cannot tap into
[12:22:47] <ryanneufeld> are you trying to bind a click or something to those elements that do not yet exist?
[12:22:59] <minna> i thought id just run a load with callback, but then the content would be fetched twice and it seems like a waste of kb
[12:23:01] <snover> livequery sucks, minna. don’t do what it does.
[12:23:16] <minna> snover: i know, but what alternative do i have?
[12:23:34] <ryanneufeld> minna: Why do you need to know about those elements?
[12:23:40] <ryanneufeld> what is it you're doing with them?
[12:23:46] <snover> if you have stuff you need to do in response to DOM elements being added dynamically, do it once the callback is done
[12:23:52] <snover> inside the callback
[12:24:03] <ibes> Hi, is there a way to let a function trigger it self?
[12:24:03] <ibes> I want to have a button with a .click-event that triggers another click-event after it is triggered
[12:24:03] <ibes> so that it goes again and again and again - but with some delay between the rounds
[12:24:27] <ryanneufeld> ibes: there is a way, but that seems silly
[12:24:30] <minna> snover: As i said, i cannot tap into the callback of the other JS, if i do it would mean changing the function, thus breaking if they change or update the cms.
[12:24:53] <ryanneufeld> minna: we get that
[12:25:01] <ryanneufeld> minna: what is the problem you're trying to solve
[12:25:13] <snover> var oldFn = obj.foo; obj.foo = function () { oldFn.apply(this, arguments); doMyShit(); };
[12:25:27] <minna> ryanneufeld: The cms JS does an ajax call that replaces the whole page content, i need to re-run my functions on the page.
[12:25:40] <ryanneufeld> minna: AH
[12:25:57] <ryanneufeld> what cms?
[12:26:15] <minna> some old school cms, seem to be home-made
[12:26:21] <ryanneufeld> you can use the live/delegate/on handlers to bind clicks to things
[12:26:30] <ryanneufeld> ?on @ minna
[12:26:30] <bot-t> minna, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:26:48] <minna> ryanneufeld: i tried that, but if the ajax content loads too slowly, my functions will not be applied to the new content
[12:26:58] <ryanneufeld> bullshit
[12:27:09] <minna> ryanneufeld: bullshit?
[12:27:38] <minna> ryanneufeld: i tried with .on('change' but as i said, my function will not get applied sometimes.
[12:28:00] <ryanneufeld> minna: change is for inputs
[12:28:08] <minna> it is an input
[12:28:31] <minna> there's also a click event that fires the ajax.
[12:28:36] <minna> same thing there
[12:28:37] <ryanneufeld> so a form is being ajax'd in
[12:28:39] <subone_> ryanneufeld, you're right it's not doing it in my demo, maybe I can track it down from here then
[12:28:50] <ryanneufeld> subone_: yeah, watch your URL bar
[12:29:06] <minna> ryanneufeld: Yes, a form in a div
[12:29:08] <ryanneufeld> subone_: chances are you just need to add a return false to your click handler
[12:29:30] <ryanneufeld> does the whole page change or only that div?
[12:29:36] <subone_> ryanneufeld, its actually not initiated from a link, on enter in a text box
[12:29:36] <minna> Only the div
[12:30:01] <ryanneufeld> subone_: interesting, not sure then without seeing it
[12:30:18] <ryanneufeld> minna: then you bind your events to the children of that div using on
[12:31:29] <minna> ryanneufeld: Yeah, that's what i did.
[12:31:37] <ryanneufeld> $('selectorForDiv input').on('change',function(){});
[12:31:55] <subone_> ryanneufeld, it is prepending after an ajax call but that shouldnt matter if its async right
[12:32:27] <ryanneufeld> subone_: that shouldn't matter no, chances are it's when you hit enter that something is happening
[12:32:33] <minna> ryanneufeld: Yeah, exacly like that is what i did.
[12:32:33] <ryanneufeld> if you're using a form submit
[12:32:52] <ryanneufeld> minna: that should work then
[12:32:58] <ryanneufeld> unless your JS is being overwritten
[12:33:39] <minna> ryanneufeld: So it should work even if the other JS ajax request fetches the page after or before my .on event fires?
[12:33:50] <ryanneufeld> yes
[12:33:54] <ryanneufeld> that's the point of on
[12:34:03] <ryanneufeld> or live/delegate
[12:34:06] <minna> ryanneufeld: Hm, ok. I'll try it again, maybe i did something wrong.
[12:34:08] <ryanneufeld> which on does
[12:34:42] <ryanneufeld> minna: if you can produce a demo, where I could see this, it would be easier to help you
[12:35:33] <minna> ryanneufeld: I will, i'm just going to try this first and see if i can reproduce the same problem i had earlier. As you say, this is how .on should work, apply stuff to future elements.
[12:35:47] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[12:36:12] <ryanneufeld> so if it's not working, then you'll need to check your selectors
[12:36:52] <subone_> ryanneufeld, ok this is wierd its actually intermittent
[12:37:01] <subone_> i cant reproduce it now
[12:37:05] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[12:37:10] <ryanneufeld> cache issue?
[12:37:17] <ryanneufeld> clear cache and try again
[12:37:50] <subone_> nope
[12:38:19] <subone_> i havent changed the original code at all, i just came back to try it again and it stoppped
[12:38:34] <ryanneufeld> I'll take credit for that
[12:38:38] <ryanneufeld> lol
[12:38:41] <ryanneufeld> j/k
[12:40:02] <subone_> oh well, thanks fro trying i'll keep my eye out for it and see what i'm doing differently to make it happen, i/o error i guess
[12:41:03] <ryanneufeld> could be a race condition too
[12:41:09] <ryanneufeld> which are always a pain to diagnose
[12:42:19] <ryanneufeld> if you control the ajax endpoint you can introduce a lag to force it
[12:42:33] <subone_> i'll try that thanks
[12:42:59] <ryanneufeld> if it's php, just pop in a sleep(10); at the top of the file
[12:44:15] <minna> ryanneufeld: I have no problem reproducing it. The onchange= event on the button fires before .on('change' does, so the function inside .on('change' never loads.
[12:44:54] <savid> Hi, according to the docs,  .live() has been replaced by .on().  However, when I use .on(),  I get "TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'".   I've confirmed I'm using jQuery 1.7.
[12:44:57] <ryanneufeld> minna: I was talking to subone_, but I'd like to see what your code is doing though
[12:45:09] <minna> ryanneufeld: I could move the onchange event to my code though.
[12:45:13] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @savid
[12:45:14] <bot-t> savid, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:45:42] <minna> ryanneufeld: Ok, i'll make a fiddle, can't make it work live, since i wouldnt know how to simulate ajax update on a fiddle
[12:45:48] <ryanneufeld> minna: if you can call the CMS' onchange from within your jquery code, and remove it from the html that would be good
[12:45:57] <Putr> hi is there a plugin that does this: http://www.queness.com/post/3036/create-a-custom-jquery-image-gallery-with-jcarousel
[12:45:59] <Putr> but easyer?
[12:46:11] <minna> ryanneufeld: That may be the only way.
[12:46:13] <ryanneufeld> minna: I would suggest calling it last just before the end of the function incase it's doing a prevent default or something
[12:46:21] <ryanneufeld> minna: wouldn't be a bad thing :)
[12:46:31] <Slartibart> Is there a way(browser plugin?) to detect if and which event that is triggered(keydown in my case)? I'm using the same .delegate() code as before, but it seems the handler is never called and I get no error messages. Perhaps some other event is "blocking" it?
[12:46:50] <ryanneufeld> savid: that's okay, I just need to see your code
[12:46:54] <minna> ryanneufeld: I'll just double check so there's no more wierdstuff.
[12:47:09] <ryanneufeld> ?g jquery gallery @Putr
[12:47:10] <bot-t> Putr, 37 Fresh jQuery Image And Gallery Display Solutions - http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/fresh-jquery-image-gallery-display-solutions/
[12:47:32] <Putr> thanks
[12:47:46] <minna> ryanneufeld: No, everything is fine, this should be the best way to do this. Thanks a lot for making me think :-)
[12:48:01] <ryanneufeld> minna: sometimes that's all we need ;)
[12:48:13] <minna> ryanneufeld: Very true :-)
[12:48:35] <ryanneufeld> Slartibart: if you're using firefox, you can use firebug+firequery to see if jquery has bound any events to an element
[12:48:47] <ryanneufeld> Slartibart: but as for global bindings, I'm not sure how you'd get that
[12:49:06] <ryanneufeld> Chrome has some built in event breaks for debugging in the webkit inspector
[12:49:36] <ryanneufeld> snover: do you know of any way to do a reverse lookup of event listeners?
[12:49:50] <Slartibart> ryanneufeld: Thanks :), more than I'd hoped for.
[12:50:05] <savid> ryanneufeld,  looks like another library I was using (jquery-tools) had an earlier version of jQuery built in
[12:50:22] <snover> ryanneufeld: reverse lookup?
[12:50:37] <ryanneufeld> well, at some point, when you bind an event
[12:50:43] <ryanneufeld> and eventListener is added
[12:50:45] <ryanneufeld> right?
[12:50:58] <ryanneufeld> so is there a way to list those?
[12:51:06] <snover> no.
[12:51:30] <minna> There is no cross-browser supported way to check for DOM changes on elements, is there?
[12:51:42] <snover> no.
[12:51:52] <minna> Thought so :-)
[12:51:57] <minna> Good to know.
[12:52:03] <minna> Thanks snover
[12:52:40] <snover> yup
[12:53:15] <ryanneufeld> surely there must be a way to see what's been bound though...
[12:53:22] <snover> no.
[12:53:24] <snover> there isn’t.
[12:53:39] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[12:54:03] <ryanneufeld> but one could duck punch the addEventListener to record them somewhere
[12:54:10] <snover> don’t go there.
[12:54:24] <ryanneufeld> enlighten me?
[12:54:38] <snover> don’t meddle with host objects
[12:55:28] <ryanneufeld> I was thinking more as a debug tool
[12:55:37] <ryanneufeld> not something to push into prod
[12:56:14] <ryanneufeld> is there a way to get the ones that jQuery specifically binds without duckpunching?
[12:56:16] <snover> not sure what such a list would really tell you.
[12:56:30] <ryanneufeld> well, a lot actually,
[12:56:34] <snover> ryanneufeld: it is highly unsupported.
[12:56:49] <snover> really. tell me what lots of things it will tell you :)
[12:57:00] <snover> things that cannot be told by, for example, putting a console.log in the event listener
[12:57:11] <ryanneufeld> k, so the console.log
[12:57:28] <ryanneufeld> will only log when the event that you added get's triggered
[12:57:55] <ryanneufeld> what would be useful is to figure out what function is being called by an event listener that your code didn't bind
[12:58:29] <ryanneufeld> so a third party script is on the page, you'd like to see what their code is doing, or where/how they are binding
[12:58:39] <minna> ryanneufeld: VERY useful
[12:58:54] <minna> but can't that already be done by inspecting the DOM properties?
[12:59:00] <snover> how would a list of handlers tell you where/how they are binding?
[12:59:55] <ryanneufeld> at the very least it would tell you that they exist
[13:01:08] <snover> and if they were delegate handlers, they wouldn’t show up on whatever you were inspecting
[13:01:32] <snover> so you would experience false comfort that something did/didn’t exist
[13:01:47] <ryanneufeld> that's one way to look at it
[13:02:25] <minna> Hm.
[13:02:25] <snover> chrome already provides information on event listeners attached to elements anyway
[13:02:45] <snover> including parents
[13:02:47] <minna> Yeah i just noticed that
[13:02:58] <minna> Event Listeners tab to the right at the bottom.
[13:03:08] <minna> Interresting
[13:03:09] <ryanneufeld> heh, so it does
[13:03:14] <ryanneufeld> well then
[13:03:23] <ryanneufeld> no need for a duck punch then
[13:03:24] <minna> How could i have missed that.
[13:03:28] <minna> I feel stupid :)
[13:03:35] <minna> need to read up on google chrome docs
[13:04:06] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I just learned the other day that chrome supports greasemonkey style scripts
[13:04:11] <ryanneufeld> out of the box
[13:04:13] <snover> My point was not so much that seeing a list of handlers can’t be useful as much as it is that 1. it’s not as useful as you think and 2. trying to fuck with it in JS is a false economy
[13:04:15] <minna> :-O
[13:04:34] <minna> snover: good points.
[13:04:54] <ryanneufeld> snover: I'll take slightly useful over useless in this case :p But I concede your point
[13:05:47] <minna> Hm, now i just need to figure out how to add .on change event to each of the input's...
[13:06:11] <minna> Should be straightforward.
[13:06:30] <ryanneufeld> minna: you can just use a class for each one and bind to "div .classname"
[13:06:55] <minna> change the onchange to datachange attribute, use .each then reference the datachange attribute.
[13:07:14] <ryanneufeld> data-change
[13:07:16] <minna> class?
[13:07:26] <ryanneufeld> like a css class
[13:07:34] <minna> Hm, i got a note about not using - on data attributes in here before.
[13:08:15] <TreasonX> clear
[13:08:25] <TreasonX> part
[13:08:27] <minna> ryanneufeld: ah, good ideá too. but i'll go with data- seem to be more supported for this type of event.
[13:08:53] <ryanneufeld> minna: I meant for your on binding
[13:09:18] <aca20031> i want to bind a click event to a canvas and figure out the x and y on that canvas that was clicked, all i can find it PageX and pageY, which is relative to the document, which only helps me if i know where the canvas is in X,Y relative to the document - can i find that or is there another way?
[13:09:45] <minna> ryanneufeld: Hm, how do you mean?
[13:09:49] <ryanneufeld> for the onchange unless the function is different every time, just read  the source code and use the functions that way
[13:10:08] <minna> ryanneufeld: it's different every time, dynamicaly generated unfortunaltely
[13:11:00] <Syco54645> i am looking for a way to make a horizontal scrollable div that scrollls by touch. this is for a touch device
[13:11:24] <ryanneufeld> minna: example?
[13:11:35] <ryanneufeld> ?g touch scroll @ Syco54645
[13:11:36] <bot-t> Syco54645, neave/touch-scroll - GitHub - https://github.com/neave/touch-scroll
[13:11:54] <ryanneufeld> Syco54645: google has your back ;)
[13:12:07] <Syco54645> i have been googling for an hour...
[13:12:14] <Syco54645> i wasnt sure what to search really
[13:12:56] <ryanneufeld> jquery touch scroll?
[13:13:00] <minna> ryanneufeld: onchange="UpdateRowQuantity(this.value,131380,0,1056617,300701,'','PL');return false;"
[13:13:31] <minna> ryanneufeld: this.value may cause problems too.
[13:13:50] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[13:14:25] <ryanneufeld> that return false might be part of your problem... not sure though, I don't work with on* attrs
[13:15:30] <aca20031> nevermind, i found .offset
[13:16:35] <aleray> it seems like the grid option for draggable and resizable is defined relatively to the element concerned... is it possible to snap on an absolute grid instead?
[13:16:39] <Syco54645> ryanneufeld: oh yes, i saw this one but being that i was unable to use it in chrome i moved on. work requires that the gestures work in chrome too
[13:16:48] <scorchedwings> Is there a room for QUnit?
[13:17:06] <ryanneufeld> Syco54645: chrome is desktop
[13:17:19] <ryanneufeld> how are you doing touch on the desktop?
[13:17:35] <Syco54645> ryanneufeld: dont argue with idiocy!
[13:17:42] <ryanneufeld> aleray: the grid 'option' is pure css
[13:18:07] <Syco54645> they want the gestures to work in chrome for testing...
[13:18:11] <Syco54645> i dont make the rules
[13:18:12] <Syco54645> trust me
[13:18:26] <ryanneufeld> there is a library you can use to simulate it
[13:18:34] <Syco54645> oh?
[13:19:04] <ryanneufeld> http://smus.com/multi-touch-browser-patch
[13:19:12] <ryanneufeld> my suggestions
[13:19:40] <aleray> ryanneufeld, what do you mean?
[13:19:44] <ryanneufeld> suggestion, just dev on desktop, but test on both. If they want to have touch working, then they should invest in some devices
[13:19:58] <Syco54645> they have devices
[13:20:01] <Syco54645> they are just idiots
[13:20:04] <minna> ryanneufeld: i'll try and remove the return false
[13:20:13] <ryanneufeld> aleray: I mean, the grid is just floating elements that have width/height
[13:20:14] <Syco54645> i dont get it
[13:20:17] <Syco54645> i dont pretend to get it
[13:21:38] <aleray> ryanneufeld, still don't get it... but here is my problem, if I have an element place at left: 5px with a grid of 10px, then it will snap at, let say 115px. I'd like it to snap at 110px or 120px
[13:22:19] <minna> ryanneufeld: Removing the return false didn't help
[13:22:26] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ aleray

[13:22:44] <aleray> ryanneufeld, ok I try
[13:23:43] <scorchedwings> Has anyone seen some recent changes in QUnit where extra assert statements show up magically in the test list?

[13:34:50] <Alexoulu> hey guys, i m building a small HTML5 + JQUERY app anyone free for 2 minutes? Have a small bug
[13:34:55] <aleray> ryanneufeld, if you look at the console log you'll see the grid is relative to the position of the resizable element; I would like it to be related to the top left corner of my page
[13:35:01] <aleray> page/window
[13:35:06] <ryanneufeld> no idea man
[13:35:15] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @Alexoulu
[13:35:15] <bot-t> Alexoulu, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:37:25] <Alexoulu> ok then what i'm trying to do is: When I select an option from the select box I'd like to save the choice in localStorage and also change the css property background-color of each task
[13:37:48] <Alexoulu> here what i ve done so far
[13:37:50] <Alexoulu> http://jsfiddle.net/bYCyx/
[13:38:24] <Alexoulu> i d like to change the color for example one color for priority 1, another for priority 2 and so on
[13:40:36] <Alexoulu> any clue?
[13:45:26] <ryanneufeld> you'd just use css()
[13:45:31] <ryanneufeld> and set the color
[13:45:34] <Alexoulu> i know that
[13:45:38] <Alexoulu> it's not a big deal
[13:45:39] <ryanneufeld> I would suggest having a class for each color thought
[13:45:41] <ryanneufeld> *though
[13:45:47] <Alexoulu> but the prob is
[13:45:52] <ryanneufeld> makes it easier to detect it's state
[13:47:14] <skamikaze> hi all
[13:47:22] <Alexoulu> how can i save a value to localstorage overwriting an existent value
[13:47:31] <ryanneufeld> use the same key
[13:47:42] <Alexoulu> cause if i try to save now it creates me a new variable on localstorage
[13:47:47] <ryanneufeld> localStorage['somekey'] = 'some value';
[13:47:55] <ryanneufeld> localStorage['somekey'] = 'some new value';
[13:48:35] <Alexoulu> ok i ll try smt... brb
[13:48:40] <Alexoulu> thx ryan
[13:50:35] <aaronmcadam> aren't you sposed to use the api
[13:50:45] <aaronmcadam> (set|get)Item?
[13:51:01] <aaronmcadam> ah it's just sugar
[13:51:26] <Alexoulu> i did
[13:52:05] <ryanneufeld> Alexoulu: aaronmcadam yes, it's just sugar
[13:52:10] <aaronmcadam> yea
[13:52:31] <aaronmcadam> got mixed up slightly with backbone models
[13:52:43] <aaronmcadam> on model attributes
[13:53:08] <aaronmcadam> but it's best to use the API in for bbone cuz of how events are bound
[13:53:16] <aaronmcadam> so cool;
[13:53:27] <Alexoulu> :)
[13:53:42] <Alexoulu> trying to learn it some basic
[13:58:41] <aaronmcadam> Alexoulu: there's a really nice abstraction library for localStorage called lawnchair
[13:58:46] <aaronmcadam> you might wanna check it out
[13:59:43] <aaronmcadam> Alexoulu: http://westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/
[14:00:12] <Alexoulu> thx aaronmcadam :)
[14:00:17] <jrockjiggz> is there a way  to cancel an ajax before it completes
[14:00:21] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[14:00:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah jrockjiggz
[14:00:33] <muhoo> why do i see stuff like this $('#dlg_Userpreference').dialog('open');  instead of $('#dlg_Userpreference').dialog.open(); ?
[14:00:46] <aaronmcadam> because that's how the api was written
[14:00:55] <aaronmcadam> u pass props to the object, not call methods
[14:01:07] <muhoo> why would they do it that way as opposed to the other way?
[14:01:07] <jrockjiggz> can you give example
[14:01:08] <skamikaze> muhoo: coz jqueryui exposes public methods like this
[14:01:09] <jrockjiggz> ?
[14:01:29] <muhoo> oh jui
[14:02:05] <muhoo> i'm stil curious why they did it that way though.
[14:02:17] <aaronmcadam> i think it's how the widget factory is set up maybe
[14:02:32] <muhoo> seems .dialog.foo('bar') is clearer than .dialog('foo', 'bar')
[14:02:36] <aaronmcadam> muhoo u could ask ajpiano
[14:02:44] <aaronmcadam> well it depends
[14:02:53] <aaronmcadam> I think it's easier to point to the instance the other way
[14:03:15] <skamikaze> muhoo: because that way you got 1 ns and can define private methods like dialog._create etc
[14:03:34] <aaronmcadam> ah so it is the widget factory then
[14:03:42] <muhoo> ah, makes sense, thanks
[14:03:52] <ryanneufeld> ahh yes lawnchair
[14:04:06] <aaronmcadam> yeah brian leroux is a legend
[14:04:23] <aaronmcadam> pity I didn't get to meet him at the conf last week
[14:04:43] <Alexoulu> localStorage['i'].setItem("color-" + i, box);
[14:04:54] <Alexoulu> doesn t write anything into localstorage
[14:05:25] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make sense Alexoulu
[14:05:40] <Alexoulu> i know
[14:05:40] <Alexoulu> sorry
[14:05:48] <aaronmcadam> localStorage['color-' _ i] = box
[14:05:57] <aaronmcadam> + i even
[14:06:06] <Alexoulu> i ll try
[14:07:22] <muhoo> this lawnchair is interesting. uses cookies?
[14:07:50] <muhoo> somehow jui tabs has persistentce too. i'm guessing cookies
[14:08:02] <ryanneufeld> muhoo: no, it's localstorage
[14:08:09] <aaronmcadam> lawnchair is a lS abstraction
[14:08:10] <minna> Hm, is it not possible to prevent.default on an input item that has onchange?
[14:08:13] <ryanneufeld> Alexoulu: no
[14:08:23] <snover> lawnchair uses a pluggable backend and will use one of many different mechanisms to persist storage
[14:08:24] <Alexoulu> doesn t work :(
[14:08:34] <ryanneufeld> localStorage['color-' + i] = box
[14:08:40] <Alexoulu> i did that
[14:08:43] <Alexoulu> doesn t work!
[14:10:06] <aaronmcadam> Alexoulu: did u try with setItem too
[14:10:10] <Alexoulu> i did
[14:10:13] <Alexoulu> i tried both
[14:10:18] <Alexoulu> lemme retry
[14:10:30] <minna> ryanneufeld: Do you know? :)
[14:10:36] <aaronmcadam> Alexoulu: http://24ways.org/2010/html5-local-storage
[14:10:58] <ryanneufeld> var colorKey = 'color'+i; localStorage[colorKey] = box;
[14:11:08] <aaronmcadam> it shouldn't matter tho
[14:11:16] <ryanneufeld> minna: it's event.preventDefault
[14:11:24] <aaronmcadam> ()
[14:11:44] <minna> ryanneufeld: Yeah, but it doesn't seem to work on onchange events.
[14:12:05] <ryanneufeld> minna: and you need to make sure that your event handler is function(event) not just function()
[14:12:49] <minna> ryanneufeld: Yes, did that too, but it doesn't seem to work for onchange events.
[14:13:05] <ryanneufeld> minna: there is no default action for on change
[14:13:12] <ryanneufeld> what is it that you're trying to prevent?
[14:13:16] <aaronmcadam> ahh good point
[14:13:22] <aaronmcadam> good catch ryan
[14:14:00] <Alexoulu> nothing
[14:14:02] <Alexoulu> :(
[14:14:02] <Sean-Der> I have been looking at .atr and .prop, but have not been having any luck. Is there a way to get the value of "title" on the selected <option> in a select?
[14:14:13] <Sean-Der> I am trying to do it on a hover
[14:14:17] <minna> ryanneufeld: the input element have onchange="" scripting that i wan't to prevent. We discussed this earlier, replacing it, but i thought prevent.default would be better.
[14:14:45] <minna> ryanneufeld: Though it seem not to be.
[14:15:17] <Alexoulu> could you guys give it a try? http://jsfiddle.net/bYCyx/2/
[14:15:55] <ryanneufeld> minna: ahh, well, do you controll the html?
[14:16:08] <ryanneufeld> minna: just remove the code that adds the onchange :p
[14:16:12] <ryanneufeld> problem solved
[14:16:17] <Alexoulu> :D
[14:16:18] <ravenzz> minna $('input').removeAttr('onchange');
[14:16:47] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[14:16:51] <aaronmcadam> or unbind
[14:17:06] <aaronmcadam> minna what you want is unbind, or if it's inline, yeah remove the attr
[14:17:07] <jrockjiggz> aaronmcadam: i'm using jQ 1.5.2, would you know how to kill pending ajax requests? http://jsfiddle.net/pXEEz/
[14:17:13] <ravenzz> or remove it from the html ++
[14:17:22] <minna> But i need the function :)
[14:17:29] <aaronmcadam> ravenzz++
[14:17:46] <ravenzz> so we need to take a look at your code minna ;)
[14:17:49] <minna> ryanneufeld: No, the tag is system generated.
[14:17:50] <aaronmcadam> remove the inline handler and attach your own
[14:18:19] <ryanneufeld> minna: .attr('onchange','');
[14:18:21] <minna> unbind can do that to element's that is not bound by jquery?
[14:18:34] <ryanneufeld> no, it can't, cause that's in the html
[14:18:39] <ryanneufeld> but if you do this:
[14:18:41] <aaronmcadam> it'd be in inline scope
[14:18:41] <ryanneufeld> minna: .attr('onchange','');
[14:18:51] <ryanneufeld> it will wipe out the onchange
[14:19:17] <ryanneufeld> which should prevent it from being called
[14:19:22] <minna> ryanneufeld: then it will remove the onchange? i need the data from the onchange. So i'll just copy the attribute to a new attribute name, then remove it. I thinks that's the only option.
[14:19:53] <ravenzz> !?
[14:19:57] <minna> But i'm thinking it may be slow for 200 rows.
[14:20:13] <ryanneufeld> minna: okay
[14:20:16] <ravenzz> 200 inline onchange?
[14:20:17] <minna> Especially since the ajax call replaces the 200 rows... so i need to re-run the function.
[14:20:19] <ravenzz> :[
[14:20:27] <minna> ravenzz: Yeah... CMS'es
[14:20:35] <aaronmcadam> christ
[14:20:46] <ryanneufeld> minna: you have more work here than just jquery
[14:20:46] <aaronmcadam> which CMS is that
[14:20:54] <minna> ryanneufeld: I know :-(
[14:20:55] <ryanneufeld> that CMS is only causing you problems
[14:21:02] <aaronmcadam> so I can add it to the Shit CMS list :)
[14:21:08] <ryanneufeld> you need to figure out where that JS is that it's calling
[14:21:10] <minna> aaronmcadam: Some damn CMS we get to practice for school work.
[14:21:18] <aaronmcadam> oh wow ok hehe
[14:21:33] <minna> I think it's ment to be a bitch so we learn
[14:21:38] <ryanneufeld> and then either duplicate the logic, or edit the html output to put the values you need in data-attrs
[14:21:42] <aaronmcadam> tell your tutor to google "unobtrusive javascript"
[14:21:42] <ravenzz> minna so remove the onchange on document ready / ajax callbacks and handle the change event with on()
[14:21:55] <ryanneufeld> Alexoulu: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/gdAhB/
[14:22:12] <minna> ravenzz: That's what i'm planning.
[14:22:27] <ravenzz> good..luck ;)
[14:22:32] <minna> ravenzz: Thanks :)
[14:22:44] <Alexoulu> ryan
[14:22:44] <ryanneufeld> jrockjiggz: upgrade to 1.7 and then you can use .stop on the jaxhr returned by $.ajax
[14:22:50] <Alexoulu> did you fix it?
[14:22:59] <ryanneufeld> Alexoulu: did you look at my example
[14:23:00] <minna> Too bad there's not way to just disable the inline onchange though, but that would probably be too easy
[14:23:14] <ryanneufeld> Alexoulu: very basic, clean example of how localStorage works
[14:23:28] <ravenzz> minna nothing is impossible, so there should be a way
[14:24:03] <ravenzz> maybe you should edit a theme file/plugin
[14:24:04] <minna> ravenzz: Not according to any document i found on javascript, i found that click's can be prevented, but not onchange
[14:24:19] <minna> ravenzz: No, this course is only javascript and jquery.
[14:24:49] <ravenzz> so you must fight with other languages craP
[14:24:53] <ravenzz> ?!
[14:25:18] <minna> I think it's about learning that even jquery and javascript have limits.
[14:25:31] <minna> The previous exersise was also a bitch
[14:25:40] <aaronmcadam> right
[14:25:56] <aaronmcadam> it's the fundamental rule in programming: garbage in, garbage out
[14:26:12] <ryanneufeld> minna: you're gonna have to modify the CMS
[14:26:23] <Alexoulu> by the way that example was ok but didn't fix my prob
[14:26:53] <ryanneufeld> Alexoulu: you mean it didn't show you that you're using localStorage wrong?
[14:28:48] <ryanneufeld> Alexoulu: for (var i = 0; i < localStorage.length / 2; i++)
[14:28:52] <ryanneufeld> What the hell are you doing?
[14:28:58] <Alexoulu> ahahhaha :D
[14:29:01] <Alexoulu> nice one indeed
[14:29:10] <ryanneufeld> that's really fucked up
[14:29:14] <Alexoulu> true division by 0
[14:29:18] <Alexoulu> i agree
[14:29:20] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[14:29:30] <Alexoulu> fuck
[14:29:32] <aaronmcadam> it's a special sort of for loop for when u don't kno what you're doin lol
[14:29:38] <Alexoulu> getting crazy
[14:29:39] <ryanneufeld> seems to be the case
[14:29:40] <Alexoulu> here
[14:29:51] <ryanneufeld> localStorage is not domain specific
[14:30:03] <ryanneufeld> so if this runs and there is already 100 items in there
[14:30:05] <ryanneufeld> and you only have two
[14:30:21] <aaronmcadam> wow good point ryan!
[14:30:23] <ryanneufeld> to you're gonna iterate over 51 items?
[14:30:40] <ryanneufeld> sorry if I'm being harsh, but that's just fucking stupid
[14:30:50] <Alexoulu> aahahahahaah
[14:30:50] <Alexoulu> :D
[14:30:52] <Alexoulu> no prob
[14:30:55] <Alexoulu> i can take it
[14:30:57] <ryanneufeld> *sorry for being harsh
[14:31:01] <Alexoulu> u re actually right
[14:31:06] <ryanneufeld> I know I am
[14:31:10] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[14:31:12] <Alexoulu> :P
[14:31:20] <Alexoulu> but ok then tell me this
[14:31:40] <Alexoulu> i got 2 fields to be stored there through a loop
[14:31:49] <Alexoulu> one is task and the other is color
[14:32:08] <Alexoulu> should i use a bidimensional array then
[14:32:13] <ryanneufeld> Alexoulu: see ?$.each
[14:32:14] <bot-t> Alexoulu, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:32:45] <ryanneufeld> iterate over each of the todos, then check for their values in localStorage
[14:32:48] <ryanneufeld> not the other way around
[14:32:55] <ryanneufeld> which is what you're currently doing
[14:32:58] <Connorhd> localStorage is domain specific I believe
[14:33:04] <ryanneufeld> Connorhd: no
[14:33:08] <ryanneufeld> it's not
[14:33:20] <donCams> what does it mean when ajax returns -1?
[14:33:24] <Connorhd> values set on one domain cannot be seen by another
[14:33:36] <aaronmcadam> offline mode
[14:33:38] <aaronmcadam> is 0
[14:33:40] <aaronmcadam> I think
[14:33:51] <Alexoulu> local specific
[14:33:52] <Alexoulu> :D
[14:34:00] <ryanneufeld> Connorhd: wait, you're right my bad
[14:34:13] <ryanneufeld> it is domain specific, doesn't change my point
[14:34:23] <ryanneufeld> iterating over the localStorage is stupid
[14:34:23] <Alexoulu> indeed
[14:34:27] <donCams> is that for me?
[14:34:29] <aaronmcadam> was gonna say, security would suck for that
[14:34:41] <ryanneufeld> donCams: no
[14:34:52] <ryanneufeld> donCams: what's returning -1?
[14:35:23] <aaronmcadam> $.ajax
[14:36:06] <donCams> yes aaronmcadam
[14:36:15] <ryanneufeld> ?$.ajax @ donCams
[14:36:16] <bot-t> donCams, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:36:25] <donCams> ...
[14:36:44] <ryanneufeld> if you read the docs, it will explain what's returned by $.ajax
[14:36:47] <ryanneufeld> it's all there
[14:37:05] <aaronmcadam> -1 is a bit worrying tho
[14:37:09] <aaronmcadam> sounds like an indexOf
[14:37:25] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: should be returning a jqXHR
[14:37:29] <aaronmcadam> aye

[14:45:19] <scorchedwings> Has anyone ever seen a case where .parents() of of an input element doesn't include the parent form?
[14:45:46] <scorchedwings> Iterating over the parents shows the div that holds the input, and then jumps directly to the body, html.
[14:45:47] <aaronmcadam> scorchedwings: really depends on ur dom structure
[14:46:05] <scorchedwings> the html is pretty simple, and the dom inspector looks correct.
[14:46:07] <ravenzz> then you should be sure that your plugin is not going to perform any security check (eg wp_verify_nonce / check_ajax_referer)
[14:46:25] <aaronmcadam> scorchedwings: jsfiddle please?
[14:48:07] <ryanneufeld> headcold!!
[14:48:09] <ryanneufeld> hi buddy
[14:48:11] <scorchedwings> aaronmcadam - hrm - it's in a set of quint fixture data. https://github.com/there4/uni-form/blob/master/test/index.html
[14:49:04] <aaronmcadam> that's strange
[14:49:35] <ryanneufeld> coldhead o/
[14:49:55] <skamikaze> scorchedwings: jsfiddle please
[14:50:28] <scorchedwings> skamikaze: I posted the source from github
[14:50:42] <skamikaze> scorchedwings: but the html only dude :)
[14:50:48] <skamikaze> what's the relating js file?
[14:52:10] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: http://www.funnymotivationalposters.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/fmp_572px/fmp/2008/08/Good_Idea.jpg
[14:52:44] <scorchedwings> @skamikaze - there isn't one, I'm poking around with the console troubleshooting a test that has started to fail. $('input[name="email"]').parents();
[14:53:28] <skamikaze> scorchedwings: pass a selector to parents or traverse with .filter or use closest if you want it to stop on first hit
[14:53:35] <scorchedwings> I was more curious if anyone had seen the behavior of missing elements from the heirarchy, something odd is going on.
[14:54:00] <scorchedwings> skamikaze: that's just it, closest(), parents() any of then turn up empty when looking for the form parent.
[14:54:16] <scorchedwings> and when you iterator over the parents list, the form just isn't in it.
[14:54:24] <jrockjiggz> .closest('form') ?
[14:54:30] <skamikaze> yep
[14:54:32] <scorchedwings> *nod*
[14:54:40] <skamikaze> domready?
[14:55:26] <scorchedwings> yeah, it's almost like it's gotten detached. I've had troubles with the latest QUnit.
[15:02:01] <scorchedwings> skamikaze: I found it - the fixture was being manipulated and an element was ending attached to the wrong node.
[15:02:14] <skamikaze> :)
[15:02:23] <scorchedwings> Thanks for listening while I sorted it out.
[15:02:42] <skamikaze> didn't help much though
[15:03:06] <scorchedwings> made me look at it differently though.
[15:35:48] <nblack8> bread
[15:36:52] <heshanh> anyone knows a simple ajax upload plugin
[15:37:06] <bobbobbins> hey, quick question...im trying to add and remove table rows, and i have a little image in each row to remove it, and if i click one it works fine, but if i add a new row, that rows image won't work...im using .on() on the images
[15:37:14] <heshanh> just need to upload, and send a response back, no need for anything fancy
[15:39:23] <coldhead> hi ryanneufeld, aaronmcadam
[15:39:28] <coldhead> i was gommuting
[15:40:18] <aaronmcadam> bobbobbins: you need the delegate method signature
[15:53:23] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm trying to select two different types of rows in a table, but in the same order they're currently in
[15:53:57] <timwis> Right now I'm doing $('#table tr.a, #table tr.b') and that selects all A and then selects all B
[15:54:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah so
[15:54:17] <timwis> even though the HTML is <tr class="a"></tr><tr class="b"></tr> a,b,a,b etc.
[15:54:23] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:54:29] <timwis> How can I get them in the order their in in the HTML?
[15:54:43] <aaronmcadam> sounds like you just want tr
[15:54:56] <aaronmcadam> and then you can filter the trs based on their classes
[15:54:58] <timwis> aaronmcadam: I want to exclude tr.c
[15:55:23] <timwis> ah, so there's no way to do it with selector? okay
[15:55:39] <aaronmcadam> like $('tr').filter( func... { return $(this).is('.a') || $(this).is('.b') } ...
[15:55:47] <aaronmcadam> that would work
[15:56:27] <timwis> interesting, okay thanks
[15:56:40] <timwis> I thought I could just use a + instead of a comma or something
[15:56:49] <aaronmcadam> hmm maybe
[15:56:55] <aaronmcadam> that's a sibling selector
[15:57:48] <timwis> well this method works. thanks.
[15:58:06] <aaronmcadam> the + ?
[15:58:47] <BinaryKitten> tr:not(.c) ???
[15:59:47] <aaronmcadam> yea
[16:00:02] <aaronmcadam> tho i don't like :, the actual methods are better
[16:00:10] <BinaryKitten> same here
[16:00:30] <ShaunR> i have a table with a bunch of rows, each row i want to delete button.  I've found alot of examples showing how to get ride of the row when clicking delete but none of them really show how to send the ajax request that does the removal.  I can do the ajax request, thats easy, but i'm alittle confused about is how to pass the row number in ajax.  i could do <tr id="row1">.. and then use
[16:00:30] <ShaunR> parents('tr') to grab it but that seams wrong.
[16:00:40] <BinaryKitten> $('#table').find('tr').not('.c')....
[16:01:05] <ShaunR> i also though about maybe adding a extra attribute to the delete a href and some how pulling that

[16:47:57] <aaronmcadam> we're grieving bobbobbins can't u see that :(
[16:48:19] <aaronmcadam> noooo
[16:48:25] <bobbobbins> poor bot
[16:48:27] <ryanneufeld> bobbobbins: look at the docs for on()
[16:48:27] <aaronmcadam> coldhead 	Coldhead enjoys the watching youth soccer.
[16:48:40] <aaronmcadam> weirdo :p
[16:48:51] <aaronmcadam> bobbobbins: you need the event delegation signature
[16:48:59] <bobbobbins> i have no idea what that is
[16:49:15] <BinaryKitten> ?on
[16:49:16] <bot-t> The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:49:20] <aaronmcadam> $( contextual element ).on( els, event, function(){... })
[16:49:32] <aaronmcadam> that's event delegation
[16:49:42] <ryanneufeld> ?ryanneufeld
[16:49:52] <BinaryKitten> urm
[16:49:58] <ryanneufeld> ?BinaryKitten
[16:50:02] <ryanneufeld> ?coldhead
[16:50:04] <BinaryKitten> aaronmcadam i think you have it backwards
[16:50:06] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[16:50:10] <aaronmcadam> no I don't
[16:50:39] <bobbobbins> hmm, ok, i'll have to look into that, i thought i was doing it right
[16:50:39] <aaronmcadam> that's the $.delegate sig, if u do that for on() it works the same way
[16:50:40] <BinaryKitten> .on( events [, selector] [, data], handler )
[16:50:49] <ryanneufeld> so a friend of mine comes on MSN, says one word
[16:50:54] <ryanneufeld> "Dilema"
[16:51:00] <ryanneufeld> I respond "Protuberance"
[16:51:22] <ryanneufeld> he comes back with "met cute and likely single girl at gun training course"
[16:51:32] <ryanneufeld> me: "See above?
[16:51:33] <ryanneufeld> "
[16:51:38] <aaronmcadam> oh wait yeah it swapped weird
[16:51:43] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[16:51:55] <aaronmcadam> I've not used the api much, I use backbone for my events
[16:52:02] <BinaryKitten> :)
[16:52:13] <aaronmcadam> makes sense i spose to push the event to the start
[16:52:29] <BinaryKitten> yeah, so live variation works
[16:52:39] <Thumper123> Hello. I was looking for some way to collapse/expand a div. I was using animatedcollapse before, however it didn't work quite as good as I hoped. Any suggestions?
[16:52:44] <aaronmcadam> ah yea
[16:52:50] <aaronmcadam> live should die soon
[16:52:58] <BinaryKitten> without second selector it acts like live
[16:53:01] <ryanneufeld> Thumper123: jquery ui acordian maybe
[16:53:04] <BinaryKitten> aaronmcadam it won't ...
[16:53:04] <aaronmcadam> well if u call any events, they all resolve to on internally anyway
[16:53:12] <BinaryKitten> drupal still uses 1.2.6
[16:53:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah i know that
[16:53:23] <aaronmcadam> drupal 6 does anyway
[16:53:35] <BinaryKitten> until all those old versions do away with old jquery..
[16:53:36] <aaronmcadam> point is the api still calls on when u use live
[16:53:48] <BinaryKitten> ah
[16:53:50] <BinaryKitten> that's good
[16:53:55] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:54:02] <ShaunR> Alittle help please? http://jsfiddle.net/JmBFB/
[16:54:08] <ShaunR> problem is when you click yes
[16:54:08] <BinaryKitten> i'm trying to persuade the office to use .on/off
[16:54:17] <ShaunR> i want to see the data-folderid from the a href clicked
[16:54:17] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:54:33] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: why such an old version of jquery?
[16:55:04] <ShaunR> ryanneufeld: it's just what i selected in jfiddle, fdiddle doesnt support the jqueryui with the latest version for whatever reason
[16:55:17] <aaronmcadam> BinaryKitten: do they know what event delegation vs propagation is?
[16:55:31] <BinaryKitten> urm
[16:55:32] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/JmBFB/1/ sure does too
[16:55:40] <BinaryKitten> possibly not
[16:55:44] <aaronmcadam> heh
[16:55:51] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: the problem you're having here, that with jquery ui widgest
[16:55:58] <aaronmcadam> just getting people to use live is probably hard enough
[16:56:08] <ryanneufeld> *widgets, this is not the elenment that was clicked to trigger it
[16:56:12] <ryanneufeld> this is the widget
[16:56:13] <ShaunR> ryanneufeld: hmm weird, i swear that option wasnt their before
[16:56:14] <aaronmcadam> i used delegate instread tho
[16:56:31] <aaronmcadam> anyway see ya guys
[16:56:36] <ShaunR> ryanneufeld: right, i understand that, i just dont know how to figure out what the element is
[16:56:55] * ryanneufeld checks the docs
[16:57:23] <BinaryKitten> right.. 1am = night time.. gnight peeps
[16:57:32] <ShaunR> ryanneufeld: what i normally do to get around this is set a hidden input or somthing on the click event
[16:57:53] <ShaunR> so the click would set the value of a input inside the dialog
[16:58:08] <ShaunR> then dialog would take that value.. but that seams like such a pain to do all the time
[16:58:21] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: oic, I think I see a solution
[16:59:17] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: oic, I think I see a solution
[16:59:22] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/JmBFB/2/
[16:59:31] <ryanneufeld> solved like a boss
[17:00:25] <ShaunR> lol, i guess that works, can multiple items be passed?
[17:00:30] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/JmBFB/3/
[17:00:38] <ryanneufeld> ?data @ ShaunR
[17:00:38] <bot-t> ShaunR, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:01:30] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: so you can either set an array/object to one key, or you can set multiple key/value pairs
[17:01:32] <ryanneufeld> it's up to you
[17:04:51] <ryanneufeld> ?cc
[17:04:51] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[17:05:20] <ryanneufeld> ?chromium
[17:05:20] <bot-t> ?eval var yay = (function(n){while(n--){print("yayyy")}})(9000);
[17:06:10] <ShaunR> ryanneufeld: hmm if i can pass a object does that mean i could do $("#vault_dialog_deletefolder").data( $this.data ); and just pass everything?
[17:06:30] <ShaunR> whoops forgot the ()..
[17:06:35] <ryanneufeld> ShaunR: did you read the docs?
[17:06:43] <ryanneufeld> ?data
[17:06:43] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:07:10] <ryanneufeld> looks like you can do that
[17:07:18] <ShaunR> yes, it says .data(key,value) and .data(object)
[17:07:29] <ryanneufeld> then I think you have an answer ;)
[17:08:39] <ShaunR> yep, looks like it works
[17:08:54] <ryanneufeld> handy innit?
[17:09:05] <ShaunR> it is
[17:29:35] <minna> If i use .on('click' on an element that get's replaced with new content via ajax, the click won't work any more. If i use .live it works. What am i doing wrong with .on?
[17:31:19] <oojacoboo> minna: what version of jquery?
[17:32:12] <minna> 1.7
[17:32:48] <minna> oojacoboo: 1.7
[17:33:10] <ryanneufeld> minna: you have to bind to a parent of the link that doesn't get replaced
[17:33:59] <minna> ryanneufeld: Hm.
[17:34:20] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: I don't think that's the case with .on()
[17:34:23] <minna> ryanneufeld: .on('click', '#bindtothis', function () {... like that?
[17:34:45] <ryanneufeld> ?on @oojacoboo minna
[17:34:46] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: you're talking about delegate
[17:34:47] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Couldn't find "on @oojacoboo minna" in jQuery Docs.
[17:34:57] <ryanneufeld> ?on() @oojacoboo minna
[17:34:58] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Couldn't find "on() @oojacoboo minna" in jQuery Docs.
[17:35:06] <ryanneufeld> ?.on() @oojacoboo
[17:35:06] <bot-t> oojacoboo, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:35:15] <minna> Yeah, i checked the docs.
[17:35:21] <ryanneufeld> delegate calls on
[17:35:23] <minna> Didn't get any wiser unfortunately.
[17:35:24] <ryanneufeld> so does live
[17:35:39] <ryanneufeld> minna: you can use the live shortcut if you want
[17:35:52] <minna> ryanneufeld: trying to avoid .live because it's going to get deprecated
[17:35:53] <ryanneufeld> $(selector).live(function())
[17:36:15] <ryanneufeld> no date for that though
[17:36:17] <minna> I wan't to know why .live is working and .on is not.
[17:36:30] <minna> Doesn't make any sense to me
[17:36:52] <oojacoboo> minna: paste your code
[17:37:19] <ryanneufeld> minna: it's likely due to how you're calling on()
[17:37:24] <oojacoboo> on binds to a parent element like delegate
[17:37:30] <oojacoboo> I thought it was like live(), but it's not
[17:37:37] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: it is like live
[17:37:43] <ryanneufeld> it's also like delegate
[17:37:43] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: the syntax isn't
[17:37:47] <ryanneufeld> and it's also like bind
[17:37:54] <ryanneufeld> but it depends on HOW you call it
[17:37:55] <oojacoboo> yes, I know what it does
[17:38:08] <oojacoboo> you have to specify the parent element with on
[17:38:10] <oojacoboo> live you do not
[17:38:20] <minna> The parent?
[17:38:24] <oojacoboo> a parent
[17:38:35] <oojacoboo> that stays in the DOM
[17:38:36] <minna> Ok, a parent that doesn't change with ajax?
[17:38:40] <oojacoboo> right
[17:38:41] <minna> ok
[17:38:43] <ryanneufeld> minna: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:38:44] <minna> I'll try
[17:38:55] <oojacoboo> minna: $("p").on("click", {foo: "bar"}, myHandler)
[17:38:58] <ryanneufeld> there is instructions on how you can call on to work the same as live
[17:39:05] <oojacoboo> it would bind to <p> in that instance
[17:39:38] <oojacoboo> $("#dataTable tbody").on("click", "tr", function(event){
[17:39:38] <oojacoboo> 	alert($(this).text());
[17:39:38] <oojacoboo> });
[17:39:40] <ryanneufeld> $(document).on("click", "a.offsite", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });
[17:39:40] <oojacoboo> ugh
[17:39:50] <oojacoboo> note that it binds to the tbody there minna
[17:39:57] <ryanneufeld> no alert!!
[17:40:13] <oojacoboo> with the on, you can bind to itself or to a parent
[17:40:36] <oojacoboo> depending on the argument you supply, it seems
[17:41:10] <oojacoboo> the second argument of the function is for the element that you're applying the event to, if you don't supply that, it would be to itself
[17:41:48] <ryanneufeld> kinda
[17:42:08] <ryanneufeld> if you don't provide a secondary selector, then on works like bind
[17:42:18] <ryanneufeld> otherwise it works like delegate
[17:42:35] <oojacoboo> same difference
[17:42:36] <ryanneufeld> to get the exact behviour of live, you just do a delegate on the document
[17:42:42] <minna> and when do it work like .live?
[17:42:45] <oojacoboo> it binds to the element before, regardless
[17:42:55] <ryanneufeld> $(document).on("click", "a.offsite", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });
[17:43:06] <ryanneufeld> that's an example of a live binding
[17:43:15] <minna> Hm.
[17:43:30] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: you mean delegate
[17:43:37] <minna> So the second element argument will be the one referenced to as (this) in the function?
[17:43:44] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: no, I mean live equivilent
[17:44:00] <ryanneufeld> minna: can you pastbin an example of the HTML produced by this CMS?
[17:44:17] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: I copied that directly from the docs see ?live
[17:44:18] <bot-t> oojacoboo, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:44:41] <minna> ryanneufeld: I just wan't to bind this to a simple a href tag :-)
[17:44:53] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: where?
[17:44:56] <oojacoboo> I don't see it
[17:45:01] <ryanneufeld> really?
[17:45:18] <ryanneufeld> its in the second yellow box
[17:45:22] <oojacoboo> yea, not what you say is .live()
[17:45:28] <oojacoboo> it's LIKE .delegate()
[17:45:48] <minna> ryanneufeld: Yeah, you where right, now it works as live.
[17:45:51] <oojacoboo> well, it's like both I guess… but the binding is to a parent element not itself
[17:46:05] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: like is simply delegate on the whole document
[17:46:10] <minna> ryanneufeld: The point of using .on instead of .live is that you can control how far up the DOM it checks for matching elements
[17:46:18] <ryanneufeld> minna: correct
[17:46:25] <ryanneufeld> minna: that's exactly the point
[17:46:31] <oojacoboo> what
[17:46:36] <minna> And that should greatly affect the speed of using .on instead of .live
[17:46:42] <oojacoboo> it's just a new function
[17:46:45] <ryanneufeld> in 1.7 live calls on
[17:46:47] <oojacoboo> it does the same as delegate
[17:46:49] <oojacoboo> or live
[17:46:52] <oojacoboo> just combines the two
[17:46:57] <minna> Ok, great.
[17:47:08] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: live and delegate call on() now
[17:47:12] <oojacoboo> yes
[17:47:14] <minna> Now i just need to rewrite a lot of code :)
[17:47:19] <oojacoboo> which is the new function
[17:47:33] <oojacoboo> but it does the same as both of those
[17:47:34] <minna> FFS, can i get tired sometime. I've taken 4 melatonin pills now.
[17:47:52] <ryanneufeld> minna: take a walk, leave the computer
[17:48:08] <minna> ryanneufeld: Will do, just have to finish this .on thingie :)
[17:48:38] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: yes, it does, that's correct. The code I pasted earlier was an example of how you can replicate the old live behavior using on()
[17:48:43] <minna> Thanks for the help ryanneufeld and oojacoboo, it was interresting :-)
[17:48:49] <ryanneufeld> minna: np
[17:49:04] <ryanneufeld> minna: if I recall you were also fighting with on change stuff right?
[17:49:06] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: actually not
[17:49:13] <oojacoboo> it was more like delegate
[17:49:21] <oojacoboo> b/c of what and how it was binding
[17:49:33] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: what do you think live was doing?
[17:49:44] <oojacoboo> live doesn't bind to a parent
[17:49:47] <oojacoboo> it binds to itself
[17:49:47] <minna> ryanneufeld: It's probably related to this issue. I will get back on that, i still haven't solved it. It's like after the .load runs, the function that is after it, never executes.
[17:49:56] <ryanneufeld> no it doesn't, it binds to the document
[17:50:01] <minna> ryanneufeld: but if i run the function in the console, it runs.
[17:50:18] <oojacoboo> ok, fair enough, it doesn't bind to a specified parent
[17:50:31] <ryanneufeld> right, nor does the example I pasted?
[17:50:55] <ryanneufeld> Rewriting the .live() method in terms of its successors is straightforward; these are templates for equivalent calls for all three event attachment methods:
[17:50:55] <ryanneufeld> $(selector).live(events, data, handler);                // jQuery 1.3+
[17:50:55] <ryanneufeld> $(document).delegate(selector, events, data, handler);  // jQuery 1.4.3+
[17:50:56] <ryanneufeld> $(document).on(events, selector, data, handler);        // jQuery 1.7+
[17:51:05] <oojacoboo> I was just considering the use of specifying document as implying a parent
[17:51:15] <ryanneufeld> For example, the following three method calls are functionally equivalent (but see below for more effective and performant ways to attach delegated event handlers):
[17:51:15] <ryanneufeld> $("a.offsite").live("click", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });                // jQuery 1.3+
[17:51:15] <ryanneufeld> $(document).delegate("a.offsite", "click", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });  // jQuery 1.4.3+
[17:51:16] <ryanneufeld> $(document).on("click", "a.offsite", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });
[17:51:25] <ryanneufeld> Functionally equivilent
[17:51:46] <oojacoboo> note that you specify the document you are setting up a live event on before with live
[17:51:50] <oojacoboo> and after with delegate
[17:51:54] <oojacoboo> as the example you pasted
[17:52:34] <ryanneufeld> huh?
[17:52:36] <oojacoboo> s/document/element :/
[17:53:13] <ryanneufeld> huh?
[17:53:15] <oojacoboo> eitherway, it's a mix of the two, I guess it just depends on how you want to compare it
[17:53:25] <oojacoboo> $("a.offsite").live("click", function(){ alert("Goodbye!"); });                // jQuery 1.3+
[17:53:34] <ryanneufeld> right
[17:53:40] <oojacoboo> what is setup as the live element?
[17:54:06] <ryanneufeld> you mean selector?
[17:54:13] <ryanneufeld> the element doesn't exist yet
[17:54:17] <ryanneufeld> that's why you're calling live
[17:54:20] <oojacoboo> it may or may not
[17:54:34] <oojacoboo> regardless, what it the event being setup onto

[17:56:42] <Sickness\> I'm looking for a solution of dragging one image to the other (or any element for that matter) and when they're colliding/one reaches over the other some event gets triggered
[17:56:54] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: I got that part
[17:56:55] <Sickness\> does anyone have any tips as to where I should look first?
[17:57:05] <Sickness\> because I have no idea whatsoever how I would accomplish this

[18:11:38] <Thumper123> Shouldn't "display:none" inline css on a div work always?
[18:12:35] <ryanneufeld> Thumper123: yes, unless something above it is hidden
[18:12:40] <oojacoboo> unless js modifies it
[18:12:45] <ryanneufeld> or the css is using !important
[18:12:49] <oojacoboo> lol
[18:12:55] <oojacoboo> something above it is hidden?
[18:13:07] <ryanneufeld> inspect the live html using firebug or webkit instpector
[18:13:13] <ryanneufeld> yes something above it in the DOM
[18:13:17] <ryanneufeld> a parent element
[18:13:19] <oojacoboo> that matters not
[18:13:33] <oojacoboo> if it's to be hidden, if a parent is hidden, it would be hidden
[18:13:59] <ryanneufeld> That's what I said
[18:14:24] <oojacoboo> that might be what you thought, but not what you said ;)
[18:15:01] <Thumper123> Trying to use AnimatedCollapse. If I set it to "Hide div when started", the div is hidden correctly. If I set it to "Persist" too, the Persist part works but the div is started open
[18:15:10] <Thumper123> I think its a js problem not css :/
[18:15:11] <ryanneufeld> I read display:block... I need new glasses
[18:15:19] <oojacoboo> :P
[18:16:26] <oojacoboo> Thumper123: check your initial css state
[18:16:38] <oojacoboo> I have no idea what effect you are looking to achieve
[18:25:05] <Thumper123> Ye Javascript is overriding my div's initial state
[18:26:05] <ryanneufeld> there you go
[18:43:33] <jaequery> can i store an already initialized javascript canvas object that takes an image/transforms/etc ...  , and store it into a database and pull it back out later ?
[18:50:53] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: that would depend on if you have a way to serialize the canvas
[18:51:06] <ryanneufeld> if you do, then saving it should be trivial
[18:51:50] <jaequery> yea so can i serialize it?
[18:52:28] <ryanneufeld> I dunno
[18:52:30] <ryanneufeld> can you?
[18:53:03] <ryanneufeld> I personally don't know

[20:42:49] <Whirl3d> Hello all. I am trying to use Ben Alman's hashchange plugin (not bbq) and I can't figure out how to remove the hash from the href without refreshing the page
[20:43:46] <Whirl3d> anybody out there?
[20:43:59] <coldhead> paging ben_alman_
[20:44:11] <insrq> yup, just not familiar with that plugin
[20:44:23] <donCams> hehe :)
[20:44:29] <coldhead> dr ben_alman_ please report to the infirmary
[20:44:45] <Whirl3d> how do you set the hash on a page to nothing without refreshing the page.
[20:45:20] <coldhead> you mean the page changes if you do window.location.hash = ''; ?
[20:45:43] <Whirl3d> window.location=window.location.href.split("#")[0]; refreshes
[20:45:47] <donCams> $('element').attr('href', theoriginalhref.replace(/#theoriginalhash/g, '');
[20:46:21] <coldhead> window.location always replaces
[20:46:29] <coldhead> refreshes*
[20:46:41] <coldhead> window.location = window.location refreshes
[20:46:54] <coldhead> if you want to modify the hash, use window.location.hash
[20:47:54] <Whirl3d> any way to get rid of the /# in address bar?
[20:48:25] <Whirl3d> window.location.hash=""; works, but leaves the "/#"
[20:49:21] <Whirl3d> coldhead, et al, thanks for your help. They can eat the # I don't care any more.
[20:49:39] <coldhead> lol
[20:49:42] <coldhead> that's the spirit
[20:49:49] <coldhead> i can't see an easy way to get rid of it
[20:49:59] <Whirl3d> Any suggestions on how to avoid refreshing the page with a contact.php script for a contact form?
[20:50:37] <coldhead> window.location.href.slice(0, -1); works!
[20:50:58] <coldhead> oh no it doesn't
[20:51:06] <Whirl3d> I tried setting a cookie in PHP with the contents of tha mailed message, then loading the success page, and it refreshes, loads the refresh page and then can't find the cookie, any suggestions?
[20:51:06] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, snack overflow
[20:52:19] <coldhead> that's terribly compicated
[20:52:25] <coldhead> can't you just use ajaxform ?

[21:29:14] <raymond1> Hi, not sure is this the right channel, a question about call js method in iframe
[21:29:51] <Eviltwin> There are limits for access to child frame
[21:29:52] <Eviltwin> s
[21:30:49] <raymond1> say , I have code like window.hello = "hello" in index.html. and index.html will include a iframe page say page2.html. Can I have any way to access the window.hello?
[21:31:01] <raymond1> well , not about jquery itself ;)
[21:31:50] <raymond1> I mean, in page2.html, I want to access window.hello, is there any way in index.html that expose this property to all it's childpage ?
[21:31:52] <Eviltwin> In the child frame, window.parent represents the window of the parent
[21:32:18] <raymond1> yes, I know. But I would like to access it as if it is it's own window's property
[21:32:38] <Eviltwin> Why?
[21:32:45] <raymond1> I try something like window.__proto__.hello = "hello" , but not work
[21:33:19] <raymond1> for I want to have page2.html not aware of the parent page. just use something as if it is native one
[21:35:00] <raymond1> to express in another way: I want to inject some method into window object, I do it once in index.html. I wish it could work for all the iframe pages
[21:35:31] <raymond1> fail to found a solution.
[21:41:10] <ruby_on_tails> i have some inputs with name  = date[] and datepicker applied, because of the same name if any date is changed in any input it sets the new date in the first date only, what do i do to resolve this conflict ?
[21:41:51] <ruby_on_tails> i cant change the name of the inputs to be different because they need to go as an array to the server
[21:41:53] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle?
[21:41:59] <Eviltwin> Example of your issues
[21:42:01] <ruby_on_tails> ok let me do that
[21:42:09] <GoSox> soooo how can I make 'something' happen every, lets say, 5 seconds?
[21:42:26] <Eviltwin> Don't really know JavaScript do you, GoSox?
[21:42:31] <coldhead> ?mdc setInterval
[21:42:31] <Eviltwin> Look at setInterval
[21:42:32] <bot-t> coldhead, window.setInterval - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Calls a function repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call to that function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setInterval
[21:43:08] <coldhead> setInterval(function () {freak_out();}, 5000);
[21:44:01] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/Haazw/ its due to the id conflict
[21:44:06] <ruby_on_tails> not the name conflict.
[21:44:22] <Eviltwin> You can only have one element with a particualr ID
[21:44:30] <ruby_on_tails> anyway to bypass that ?
[21:44:44] <ruby_on_tails> without removing duplicate ids ?
[21:46:35] <Eviltwin> Is your conflict server side or client side?
[21:46:37] <GoSox> is there a function to reset setInterval's counter?
[21:46:51] <Eviltwin> It doesn't have a counter
[21:47:18] <GoSox> i mean that if i have a function repeating every 10 seconds, and it's going to happen next in 5 seconds, is there a way i can reset it back to 10
[21:47:39] <coldhead> ?cleartimeout @ GoSox
[21:47:45] <coldhead> it's all covered in the docs
[21:47:47] <Eviltwin> ?mdc clearInteval @ GoSox
[21:47:56] <bot-t> GoSox, jquery.timeout: jQuery.Deferred wrapper for the native JavaScript ... - jQuery 1.5 introduced the Deferred callback management system, to ease handling callbacks for asynchronous events. Although the jQuery documentation contains examples on how to use Deferred objects... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-timeout
[21:47:56] <bot-t> GoSox, window.clearInterval - MDN - Cancels repeated action which was set up using setInterval() . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.clearInterval
[21:48:19] <coldhead> but what's even better is to make recursive calls to setTimeout
[21:48:29] <coldhead> then you can make it as fancy as you need
[21:48:31] <Eviltwin> Discussed on the setInterval page
[21:48:44] <coldhead> ?g zetafleet setinterval harmful
[21:48:45] <bot-t> coldhead, Why I consider setInterval to be harmful | Blog | Zetafleet | Web ... - http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[21:51:12] <GoSox> so i can call setInterval() anywhere in a javascript and it will keep doing it's thing?
[21:51:36] <coldhead> pretty much!
[21:52:04] <GoSox> like if i call it within a function, it won't stop repeating after that function is done, or anything like that
[21:52:11] <Eviltwin> No
[21:52:49] <coldhead> it's forever
[21:52:53] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[21:52:59] <coldhead> or until you close the window
[21:53:03] <coldhead> also like a woman's love
[21:53:06] <GoSox> so it will randomly stop without noticed and for no reason
[21:53:17] <coldhead> hahah
[21:53:22] <Eviltwin> GoSox: It'll stop if you're not nice to it
[21:53:37] <coldhead> i'm glad we've had this talk
[21:53:44] <GoSox> and it will bitch and moan indefinitely if you don't pay "enough" attention to it
[21:55:18] <GoSox> do i have to worry about variable scope when i'm making functions on the spot? I don't know what it's called, but when you do something like $(id).click( function() { statement; }
[21:55:24] <GoSox> );
[21:55:29] <Eviltwin> It's called an anonymous function
[21:55:36] <Eviltwin> And it has closure properties
[21:55:49] <Eviltwin> Meaning any variables in the parent scope are accessible to it

[21:59:51] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/Haazw/1/ why doesnt this work ?
[22:00:33] <Eviltwin> What doesn't work about it

[22:02:49] <coldhead> sup localhost
[22:02:56] <coldhead> you have all my favourite files
[22:14:28] <oojacoboo> is there something like findNext() in jquery
[22:14:39] <oojacoboo> that will go down the DOM on the same level until it matches?
[22:14:40] <Eviltwin> Meaning waht?
[22:14:48] <Eviltwin> On the same level?
[22:14:54] <Eviltwin> So siblings?
[22:14:57] <oojacoboo> yes
[22:15:02] <Eviltwin> It's just .next

[22:16:05] <oojacoboo> yep, cheers
[22:34:33] <THEtheChad> I notice how jQuery returns an array like collection and I'm wondering how this is done. Any implimentation I do outputs an object in the console. Is there a magic getter method I don't know about? I couldnt' find anything in the Core that alluded to how this was done.
[22:35:37] <Cork> THEtheChad: jquery extends Array
[22:36:53] <THEtheChad> Cork: Yeah, I noticed that Array.prototype returned a collection as well. Is this a private method that's innaccessible outside of extending Array?
[22:37:47] <Eviltwin> THEtheChad: var a={length:0,splice:function(){}};
[22:37:49] <Eviltwin> a
[22:37:59] <Eviltwin> You'll see it shows up as an array
[22:39:15] <Cork> Eviltwin: no it shows up as an object to me
[22:39:27] <Eviltwin> Cork: Try Safari or Chrome
[22:39:44] <Cork> a.constructor.name
[22:39:44] <Cork> "Object"
[22:39:46] <Cork> Object
[22:40:20] <Cork> the console output is just there choice of implementation
[22:40:31] <Cork> and has little to do with javascript
[22:40:40] <Eviltwin> I'm saying that the WebKit console was designed to show array-ish objects as arrays
[22:40:49] <coldhead> their*
[22:40:55] <Eviltwin> And it determines arrayishness by the type of the length and splice properties
[22:41:16] <Cork> or just by the existence of the function
[22:41:54] <Cork> sounds like a simple faling feature sniff
[22:42:08] <Cork> array's are hard to detect correctly
[22:42:20] <Cork> so i'm not supriced they choose this solution
[22:42:44] <GoSox> did windows 2000 come with IE6? anyone know off the top of their head?
[22:42:50] <Eviltwin> For WebKit, if an object has a typeof o.length == "number" and typeof o.splice == "function"
[22:42:55] <Eviltwin> It will show it as an array
[22:42:58] <Cork> GoSox: yes
[22:43:36] <Cork> GoSox: wait a min no, it was ie5.5
[22:44:13] <GoSox> i tried setting up a windows 98 machine as my 'dinosaur' test platform... but even a fresh clean installation crashes constantly
[22:45:20] <Cork> GoSox: sorry wrong again windows me that came just before 2k had 5.5
[22:45:24] <Cork> 2k had 6
[22:45:56] <Cork> GoSox: but you seriusly care about those old browsers...
[22:46:01] <Cork> <_<
[22:46:14] <Cork> scary
[22:46:19] <coldhead> so many memories
[22:46:22] <GoSox> i want to make sure they get sent to my "upgrade your browser!" page properly :D

[22:46:44] <GoSox> I was always a netscape guy, until I installed OS X 10.0 and switched to OmniWeb, what a browser that was!
[22:46:59] <donCams> you guys are old
[22:47:23] <Cork> donCams: ya i predate ie so... ;P
[22:47:38] <coldhead> just ensure the page crashes old browsers
[22:47:42] <coldhead> that'll teach em
[22:47:43] <donCams> predate? as in using console to use internet? ;)
[22:48:13] <Cork> donCams: as in my first comp had < 2mb or ram and 30 mb of disk space was A LOT
[22:48:39] <GoSox> my first had 1mb i think, but my second, my second had 5mb of ram and a hard drive! no more dual floppies for me!
[22:48:40] <donCams> oh, i thought slide-rule old :)
[22:48:59] <coldhead> i started with 8MB ram, 120MB hdd
[22:49:10] <coldhead> and a good old fashioned turbo button
[22:49:13] <GoSox> i upgraded from 5 mb to 8 mb, it only cost $275
[22:49:27] <donCams> us asians always start with abacus... lol jk
[22:49:28] <GoSox> i still don't understand the turbo button
[22:49:50] <Cork> GoSox: music programs and old games didn't work in the higher speed
[22:50:02] <Cork> so you had to be able to switch it off
[22:50:23] <Cork> as they built there timers on clock cycels...
[22:50:29] <donCams> i miss my floppy disk
[22:50:40] <Cork> i don't!
[22:51:03] <Cork> i miss the simplisity of the os though
[22:51:39] <Cork> and this one is a bit interesting
[22:51:41] <coldhead> i miss having to download winsock to get on the net
[22:51:52] <Cork> one of my old compilers are smaller then jquery :)
[22:51:52] <Cork> http://prog21.dadgum.com/116.html
[22:52:09] <Cork> minimized jquery even :)
[22:52:21] <GoSox> i miss very little about the old days
[22:52:28] <donCams> you're officially old
[22:52:32] <GoSox> and i had macs, so i didn't have to deal with any of the windows crap
[22:52:35] <GoSox> and i still don't miss it
[22:52:44] <coldhead> the borland turbo stuff was so excellent
[22:52:55] <coldhead> i almost would have paid for it
[22:52:57] <GoSox> back in the days when software was good, but the hardware sucked and was holding it back big time
[22:53:00] <GoSox> now it's the opposite
[22:53:00] <Cork> GoSox: i don't use gui's that much, console is my love ;)
[22:53:10] <Cork> coldhead: i did :)
[22:54:01] <Cork> borland turbo series was really nice, there haven't been a compilor like it since
[22:54:16] <Cork> asm to basic was all super nice
[22:54:42] <Cork> and its trace stepping hasn't been seen since
[22:54:47] <coldhead> i cut my teesh on TASM
[22:55:40] <Cork> built lots of fun little os persistent bg processes :)
[22:56:01] <coldhead> me too! TSRs!
[22:56:09] <Cork> typ :)
[22:56:14] <Cork> *yup
[22:56:20] <coldhead> the best thing in the world was to quit a program and have it show a message a few minutes later
[22:56:28] <coldhead> because HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT!!!!
[22:56:31] <tdignan> It is obvious how to tell if an error occured in $.get, but how do I print the reason for the error? is it possible?
[22:56:33] <coldhead> OMG!!!
[22:56:33] <donCams> this chan's cool. it's like i'm taking computer history class :3
[22:56:47] <GoSox> i love how IE 7 won't let you download Safari because it thinks safari is insecure or some crap
[22:57:35] <Cork> tdignan: is it a network error or a js error?
[22:57:54] <Cork> tdignan: just check the console and you should see that
[22:57:56] <tdignan> Cork: I suspect it might be the same origin policy, but that's my guess
[22:58:03] <tdignan> Cork: nothing prints in the console
[22:58:23] <Cork> tdignan: check the xhr.status
[22:58:27] <tdignan> ah, thanks.
[22:58:32] <tdignan> that's returned by $.get?
[22:58:40] <Cork> in the error event
[22:58:52] <Cork> not sure if get has it
[22:58:59] <Cork> you might have to use $.ajax
[23:00:08] <Cork> tdignan: you can bind it through the deferred .error() callback
[23:00:34] <tdignan> I've got em now
[23:00:50] <tdignan> jqXHR.status == 0, textStatus == "", errorThrown == ""
[23:02:22] <tdignan> I think the problem is the same-origin policy
[23:02:33] <tdignan> but I have no way of telling
[23:02:42] <coldhead> that old kentucky same-origin policy :(
[23:03:02] <tdignan> I'm using jquery in phoneGap, and need to make web requests
[23:03:14] <tdignan> otherwise I'll end up throwing this away and writing 3 separate apps
[23:03:25] <tdignan> or 3 bindings to native apis :/
[23:03:43] <tdignan> I checked the URI in the browser, and it gives me back my expected json
[23:03:44] * Hierofant sets up Firefox v.14
[23:11:01] <poppiez> I'm using this code to make sure images have loaded: http://pastie.org/private/eikemdrioqtfkwohouqz1q. however, it seems like using a single image object (this.dummy) causes some trouble. after loading a random image, all future images are true for this.complete. any way to make this work as expected (treat each new src as a new image)?
[23:31:30] <cgiGeek> is there anyone I can hire for a few mins ?
[23:32:18] <raulirikama> what do you need?
