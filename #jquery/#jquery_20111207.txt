[00:00:06] <Spadeski> Codezombie it probably didnt see parenthesis doing 85*100/85 lol
[00:00:21] <X-Rob> No, Spadeski, CodeZombie is right. I derped.
[00:00:33] <Spadeski> Ah alrighty then :0
[00:00:35] <Spadeski> :)
[00:01:03] <X-Rob> coz I'm doing n/n*100
[00:01:10] <X-Rob> which is just .. derp.
[00:02:57] <CodeZombie> for the record, 100/.85 was the answer
[00:03:03] <CodeZombie> and thanks again
[00:03:51] <Eviltwin> Spadeski: Actually, sorry, I don't have time to code this
[00:04:08] <Eviltwin> But you probably want to wrap them all in a strip div
[00:04:20] <Eviltwin> Wide enough to fit all of them
[00:04:31] <Eviltwin> Then absolutely position them within a div with overflow: hidden;
[00:04:48] <Eviltwin> And slide it from left: 0px; to left: -100px to left: -200px;
[00:04:51] <Eviltwin> If they're 100px wide
[00:05:07] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[00:05:17] <Spadeski> Yup perfectly
[00:11:06] <Ortund> Spadeski: you are right, nothing wrong with it... Problem was I was hiding the span on server side... derp
[00:12:41] <Spadeski>  Ortund :)
[00:17:55] <igore> !help
[00:18:10] <Eviltwin> ?ask
[00:18:11] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:18:39] <igore> i'm calling a jquery plugin via jQuery('.class').myPlugin();
[00:18:51] <igore> that works
[00:19:05] <igore> but if I want to do: jQuery('<div>').myPlugin();
[00:19:09] <igore> it doesn't woek
[00:19:37] <raulirikama> jQuery('div').myPlugin();
[00:19:37] <igore> the plugin return this function: return this.each(function(){}
[00:20:15] <Eviltwin> igore: What'd your goal with calling jQuery('<div>').myPlugin()?
[00:20:17] <igore> whats the diff. between jquery('<div>') and ('div')??
[00:20:28] <Eviltwin> Do you know what a CSS selector is?
[00:20:37] <igore> I want to bind a click event, hover and wrap in a form div
[00:23:25] <Ortund> I'm hiding an item on my page if a certain condition is met, else I'm making sure it remains visible, buuuuut... $("#next").show(); doesn't seem to do anything
[00:23:30] <Ortund> once it's been hidden
[00:24:00] <igore> yes I do
[00:24:22] <Eviltwin> igore: Do you know what HTML looks like?
[00:24:30] <igore> It works fine when I use a CSS selector, if that is what you are getting at?
[00:24:41] <Eviltwin> jQuery("div") is a selector
[00:24:46] <Eviltwin> It selects every div on the page
[00:24:50] <igore> Yes, of course I know what HTML looks like
[00:24:55] <igore> oh..
[00:24:56] <Eviltwin> jQuery("<div>") is HTML
[00:25:03] <Eviltwin> It creates a new DIV element
[00:25:06] <igore> ok.. i knew that..
[00:25:07] <igore> haha
[00:25:09] <Eviltwin> But it's not in the DOM anywhere yet
[00:25:14] <Eviltwin> You need to put it somewhere
[00:25:14] <igore> ok..
[00:25:33] <igore> I wanted to create html elements and bind click events on the fly...
[00:25:36] <Eviltwin> You might want to see ?wrap too
[00:25:37] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[00:26:01] <igore> My plugin uses .wrap
[00:26:23] <igore> I'm creating HTML elements on the fly using jQuery..
[00:26:36] <igore> for example..
[00:26:51] <igore> a user will clicks on "add new item"
[00:26:51] <Eviltwin> $("<div>").bind("click",function(){...}) is binding to a newly created element
[00:27:37] <igore> and I want to bind multiple events to this newly created element..
[00:27:48] <Eviltwin> Then chain
[00:28:01] <Eviltwin> Or put multiple events in the ""'s
[00:28:04] <Ortund> is show() meant to display objects once hidden with hide() ? Because this isn't working
[00:28:16] <Eviltwin> Ortund: Code?
[00:28:52] <igore> http://jsfiddle.net/yBLYY/
[00:29:05] <Eviltwin> Was asking Ortund
[00:29:23] <igore> I know, but when you have a moment, I'd like you to take a look at my code too..
[00:29:31] <Eviltwin> So what's wrong?
[00:29:44] <igore> Ortund, paste your code in jsfiddle.net send the link
[00:29:52] <Eviltwin> igore: I'd like you to pay me for my time but that's not going to happen now is it? :P
[00:30:09] <igore> How much you charge?
[00:30:15] <igore> and would you take any interesting trades?
[00:30:16] <igore> ;)
[00:30:22] <Eviltwin> $250 / hour
[00:30:28] <Eviltwin> And I round up to the hour
[00:30:31] <igore> s***.
[00:30:43] <Eviltwin> So what's the problem?
[00:30:51] <Eviltwin> And why are you referencing jQuery everywhere instead of $?
[00:31:07] <Eviltwin> Okay, 2 places
[00:31:17] <igore> your right..
[00:31:21] <igore> WordPress is the reason..
[00:31:27] <igore> but I shouldn't need to use jQuery there..
[00:31:43] <Eviltwin> Why are you ending every sentence with two periods?
[00:31:55] <igore> bad habit..
[00:32:13] <Eviltwin> Okay, I've added an ignore scropt for all sentences than end with ".." to encourage you to stop
[00:32:22] <igore> i'd like to create an HTML element and call my plugin..
[00:32:30] <igore> but this only works if I use a CSS selector..
[00:32:56] <igore> is there a way to do it inline with jQuery('<div>').myPlugin();
[00:33:06] <Eviltwin> What doesn't work about that?
[00:33:28] <Eviltwin> Oh, self.options is a bad idea
[00:33:41] <Eviltwin> Have you read this? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[00:33:54] <Eviltwin> The bit about Data
[00:34:38] <igore> I'm aware that might code is a little amateur.
[00:35:00] <igore> I'm doing my best and hoping for a working beta so I can have a demo to bring more people on board.
[00:35:22] <igore> I'm going to read this link you sent me in a min, thanks for your help..
[00:35:32] <igore> Who should I make the payment out to?
[00:36:19] <Eviltwin> Right here: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[00:36:22] <logii> hey, now that query site is down, any ideas on where i can download query plugins?
[00:36:31] <logii> perhaps a mirror or something like that?
[00:36:34] <Mech0z> Anyone that can tell me how I with line 3 checks if the div after the H3 have IsExpanded class ? http://jsfiddle.net/nWK8L/4/
[00:36:47] <Mech0z> My try dont work
[00:37:26] <Eviltwin> Mech0z: Does it have to be after an h3?
[00:37:55] <Mech0z> Eviltwin: you can see I have given the 2 of the divs an IsExpanded as example
[00:38:04] <Mech0z> if I move IsExpanded I break alot of other code
[00:38:44] <Mech0z>  var expanded = $(this).next().hasClass('IsExpanded'); seems to work
[00:39:52] <Ortund> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/2vHLV/         <<< basically if the 1st and last image is selected, the previous/next button should disappear accordingly. the show(); function doesn't seem to display the next button after it's been hidden
[00:40:39] <Eviltwin> Ortund: There's a problem in one of your if conditions
[00:41:45] <Ortund> Eviltwin, yeah I'm struggling to get my head around it all properly
[00:42:19] <Eviltwin> Ortund: How do you set a variable equal to another variable?
[00:42:52] <yamahaalex> var = var
[00:43:00] <inki> bonjour
[00:43:13] <Spadeski> inki Bon'kour
[00:43:13] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex: That wasn't a question for you

[00:43:50] <B_Lizzard> Hi, I'm using JQuery UI's selectable module on a list which has underlying checkboxes which are triggered by selection and links, which I cannot get to work.
[00:43:58] <Ortund> oops... forgot the other =
[00:44:08] <B_Lizzard> Is there any way I can have the event pass-through or whatnot?
[00:44:13] <Eviltwin> Ortund: Yup
[00:44:38] <B_Lizzard> I use this to initialize the selectable thing:
[00:44:49] <B_Lizzard> 	$('#generic-list').selectable({
[00:44:50] <B_Lizzard> 		selected: function(event, ui) {
[00:44:53] <B_Lizzard> 			$(ui['selected']).children('.list-checkbox').click();
[00:45:01] <B_Lizzard> (Apart from the closing braces and whatnot)
[00:45:13] <Eviltwin> B_Lizzard: ?p
[00:45:15] <Eviltwin> Err
[00:45:21] <Eviltwin> ?p @ B_Lizzard
[00:45:22] <bot-t> B_Lizzard, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:45:46] <B_Lizzard> Yeah, sorry bout that, I guessed three lines weren't a lot.
[00:46:59] <B_Lizzard> Lemme do jsfiddle, then.
[00:47:00] <inki> B_Lizzard: A Lot starts at two.
[00:47:07] <B_Lizzard> :)
[00:47:12] <B_Lizzard> OK, sorry bout that.
[00:50:11] <B_Lizzard> http://jsfiddle.net/mz4CA/
[00:50:34] <B_Lizzard> The checkboxes are go, but I cannot get to the links.
[00:51:38] <Ortund> Eviltwin, now the condition fails regardless
[00:51:57] <trufoi> hi
[00:52:04] <Eviltwin> B_Lizzard: http://jsfiddle.net/mz4CA/1/
[00:52:24] <B_Lizzard> Thanks!
[00:52:33] <B_Lizzard> That works perfectly, thanks Eviltwin!
[00:52:35] <carnau> Hi, I'm trying to access an object property value, but it always say "undefined". I printed the entire object and it has values, so I don't know what's happening. I'm trying to get it using "obj_name.property", is that correct?
[00:52:45] <trufoi> did anyone of you ever made the experience that calling jquery.closest causes a redirect in opera
[00:53:02] <trufoi> (selected_elemet).closest(".serviceData")[0];
[00:53:04] <Eviltwin> Ortund: You are using MooTools on jsFiddle
[00:53:13] <Cork> carnau: pb the output you get when you print the object
[00:53:15] <trufoi> jQuery(selected_elemet).closest(".serviceData")[0];
[00:53:19] <Eviltwin> trufoi: Pretty sure it doesn't
[00:53:21] <Ortund> no, I updated my code as it is in my project
[00:53:52] <Eviltwin> Ortund: total doesn't seem to be defined
[00:53:56] <molavy> hi
[00:54:17] <Eviltwin> And you shouldn't use DOM elements to store data
[00:54:25] <trufoi> Eviltwin: when im debuggin, exactly at this line $(selected_elemet).closest(".serviceData")[0]; it is jumping to another page
[00:54:48] <molavy> i have lots of nested table
[00:54:51] <carnau> Cork, http://pastebin.com/AKK7K6n1
[00:54:55] <Eviltwin> trufoi: You're doing something else wrong somewhere
[00:55:18] <Cork> carnau: ah, json
[00:55:24] <carnau> yes
[00:55:31] <alex88> hi guys, how can i select only the first parent that match a selector? using parents('.clearfix') returns all parents
[00:55:32] <Cork> carnau: you need to convert it to javascrit
[00:55:42] <Cork> carnau: thats just a string
[00:55:47] <dark_echo> hi
[00:55:59] <Spadeski> Sup dark_echo
[00:56:02] <Cork> carnau: you get this through jquery?
[00:56:02] <dark_echo> im having problem with jquery ui modal dialog
[00:56:04] <trufoi> Eviltwin:  unfortunately not, i only have this js
[00:56:04] <Eviltwin> alex88: see ?closest
[00:56:05] <bot-t> alex88, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:56:07] <ravenzz> alex88 closest?
[00:56:09] <molavy> <table><tr><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td>...</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
[00:56:11] <ravenzz> there you go
[00:56:17] <Eviltwin> trufoi: Make a jsFiddle demo of the issue
[00:56:17] <molavy> something like above code
[00:56:21] <dark_echo> im able to show the dialog
[00:56:23] <dark_echo> but
[00:56:32] <carnau> Cork, hmmmmm ok! Yes it's JQuery.
[00:56:48] <alex88> ravenzz: Eviltwin: oh great, thank you guys!
[00:56:49] <Cork> carnau: what function are you calling?
[00:56:51] <dark_echo> there are some differences against to jquereyui demo site
[00:57:02] <ravenzz> you're welcome
[00:57:27] <molavy> but i want extract all table and create one table real content,(that means extract iternal tables and show up blow toghether)
[00:57:31] <dark_echo> some css classes are not applied to dialog's buttons and the final markup is different
[00:57:44] <Cork> carnau: as in $.ajax/get/post/getJSON/getScript...
[00:57:54] <dark_echo> im using this code http://pastebin.com/c8rSXuv8
[00:58:04] <molavy> any idea?
[00:58:11] <carnau> Cork, I'm working with nodejs. I 'm passing the message data from nodejs to my client, that works in jquery.
[00:58:28] <dark_echo> the final button' s html is http://pastebin.com/2hNucq1j
[00:58:30] <ravenzz> molavy you mean join the tables?
[00:58:32] <Cork> carnau: ok, so its not ajax call?
[00:58:37] <Cork> *no
[00:58:40] <dark_echo> but on the demo site it is as http://pastebin.com/BV0LyWqF
[00:59:05] <carnau> Cork, no isn't.
[00:59:11] <Cork> carnau: then do var data = JSON.parse(json);
[00:59:17] <dark_echo> so why is my markup different than the demo site
[00:59:18] <Cork> then do data.message
[00:59:20] <dark_echo> any ideas ?
[00:59:41] <molavy> in another way ,yes, extract all internal table and create one table with no nested table,just use tr and td
[00:59:50] <Eviltwin> When breaking a string over two lines in JavaScript, should the + go at the end of the line being broken or at the beginning of the break line?
[01:00:02] <Cork> carnau: it might also be you don't need to convert it to json on the nodejs side
[01:00:08] <Cork> depending on how your doing it
[01:00:56] <dark_echo> ?
[01:01:36] <carnau> Cork, hmmmmmmm I understand, but I think that I can't use this function 'cause I'm using drupal: http://drupal.org/node/242642
[01:02:12] <ravenzz> molavy var newTable = $('<table/>').append($('tr')).appendTo('body'); ?
[01:02:14] <Cork> carnau: uh.. not sure what you mean
[01:03:24] <molavy> in this case ....append($('tr')).... will have tr that have table inside them
[01:03:37] <ravenzz> ah ok
[01:03:41] <ravenzz> so
[01:05:47] <carnau> Cork, well, drupal is a framework that provides it's own jquery functions. I will check how to do this, sure it's documented. Thank you very much!
[01:06:03] <molavy> no idea?
[01:06:12] <B_Lizzard> I was too quick to  joy, it seems that the jquery ui stylesheet (specifically, the marching ants selection thing) stands before the list item and as such is always the target for the click event.
[01:06:14] <Cork> carnau: i don't see how the removal of parseJson from the Drupal object matters
[01:06:47] <Cork> carnau: theres already a nativ object in the browser that parse json JSON.parse
[01:06:59] <B_Lizzard> I guess I could hide it for an instant
[01:09:08] <Blaster> is there a way to revert CSS to default?
[01:10:13] <Cork> Blaster: make your changes through a class and remove the class?
[01:10:50] <Cork> Blaster: you can remove the style attribute, but thats about it
[01:11:54] <Cork> Blaster: if your original was inline css, then no there isn't even any data keept in the browser about what that was
[01:11:59] <carnau> Cork, ah ok I understand. I'm trying to use the native version to see if it works. I'm a novice programmer, some things are hard for me ;)
[01:13:19] <carnau> Cork, oh yeah, I works! Many thanks, saved my day :D
[01:14:40] <molavy> there is no idea?
[01:15:13] <Eviltwin> molavy: I honestly didn't even come close to understanding what you were asking
[01:16:57] <molavy> i have lots of nested table
[01:17:00] <B_Lizzard> This is a pickle.
[01:17:04] <molavy> <table><tr><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td>...</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
[01:17:10] <molavy> something like above code
[01:17:18] <Eviltwin> molavy: Looks ugly
[01:17:45] <Ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/2vHLV/1/          <<< can anyone suggest a way to smooth the change of the main image when next/previous/thumbnail is clicked?
[01:18:50] <molavy> i want extract all tr(all tr inside nested table that means just real content) and create one table with this tr
[01:18:51] <Eviltwin> Ortund: Here's what I see: http://jsfiddle.net/2vHLV/1/show/
[01:18:54] <Eviltwin> Nothing smooth about it
[01:19:38] <Eviltwin> molavy: $("tr").remove().appendTo("#myhugetable"); ?
[01:20:31] <molavy> that is like what ravenzz suggest
[01:20:43] <molavy>  var newTable = $('<table/>').append($('tr')).appendTo('body');
[01:20:53] <molavy> $("tr").remove().appendTo("#myhugetable");
[01:20:54] <dwarder> i need a code coverage tool that will write js files list that were used during current execution which coverage tool can do that?
[01:20:55] <molavy> but
[01:21:13] <molavy> in this case ....append($('tr')).... will have tr that have table inside them
[01:21:23] <dwarder> or maybe it is not a code coverage?
[01:21:29] <Deele> any css valign gurus' here?
[01:21:31] <Eviltwin> molavy: And you don't want that?
[01:21:41] <Eviltwin> Deele: see ?ask
[01:21:41] <bot-t> Deele, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:21:43] <molavy> but i want go inside table and extract trs
[01:21:44] <Ortund> ok then Eviltwin... http://pop.netgendns.co.za/Work.aspx (click on the "View Gallery" link near the bottom of the page)
[01:21:57] <Deele> then please, help me with vertical aligning, here is my try http://jsbin.com/ezoqof/4/edit

[01:23:12] <Eviltwin> molavy: http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[01:23:15] <dwarder> anyone uses code coverage toos?
[01:25:20] <Blaster> hey im having trouble changing the background-position using jquery
[01:25:31] <Blaster> $(elem).css('background-position','0 0');
[01:25:36] <Blaster> $(elem).css('backgroundPosition','0 0');
[01:25:39] <Blaster> tried both... neither worked
[01:27:40] <Cork> Blaster: the first one should work
[01:28:18] <alex88> if i try to get the html() from a display:none element won't it work? because it returns null
[01:29:18] <Ortund> alex88 try text()
[01:29:24] <alex88> Ortund: empty
[01:29:43] <igore> Eviltwin: I have another problem with that jQuery plugin you helped me with earlier.
[01:29:44] <Ortund> paste code in jsfiddle?
[01:30:04] <igore> $(this).wrap(myForm); is not wrapping this with the form element
[01:30:14] <igore> http://jsfiddle.net/yBLYY/1/
[01:30:23] <igore> its the 4th line of code from the bottom
[01:30:25] <alex88> Ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/KQgNk/1/ check this
[01:30:31] <alex88> Ortund: click on add player
[01:32:46] <fff> heello
[01:32:49] <alex88> Ortund: check http://jsfiddle.net/KQgNk/2/ for alert version..easier to debug
[01:35:01] <Eviltwin> alex88: You know .html() means the contents of an element, right
[01:35:05] <Eviltwin> And doesn't include the element itself
[01:35:31] <Ortund> alex88: get rid of :first-child
[01:35:36] <alex88> Eviltwin: right... so $("#player_template:first-child").html() should return the clearfix div right?
[01:35:49] <alex88> Ortund: it works in that case, but i want just the .clearfix element
[01:35:58] <alex88> why it's null with :first-child?
[01:35:58] <risky_s> how I assign a value to variable...variable_name = 1? or variable_name.val(1)?
[01:36:13] <alex88> risky_s: first one
[01:36:20] <risky_s> thx
[01:37:26] <radiantstatic> If you click the "write mail" icon in the bottom left of my page a panel will open. I ofr the life of me cannot close it. the #mailCloseButton just won't work - http://radiantstatic.com/build
[01:37:57] <Ortund> alex88: $("#player_template").find(".clearfix").html()
[01:38:51] <alex88> radiantstatic: easeOutCirc is not defined, try linear
[01:39:21] <Cork> Blaster: did you get it working?
[01:39:49] <alex88> Ortund: Ortund but i wont the div too, not only the content...
[01:40:08] <alex88> seems like a bug for me that it doesn't work with first-child
[01:40:56] <alex88> radiantstatic: plus, you have to load jquery ui after jquery
[01:41:07] <alex88> do that and it will be fixed i think
[01:41:09] <radiantstatic> alex88: whoops!
[01:41:32] <puddlefish> hey guys, i'm working on a filter by class project, but i need to be able to group selectors, i'm not sure if it's possible :|
[01:41:44] <Ortund> alex88: then give the div that contains clearfix a classname and use children('.clearfix_container').html(); or something
[01:41:59] <MrBenn> Group selectors?
[01:42:39] <puddlefish> i know grouping is possible, eg. $('.class1,class2,class3'), but i need to actually group inside the selector, something like $(('.class1,.class2').('.class3,class4'))
[01:42:42] <puddlefish> if you understand what i mean :p
[01:43:22] <igore> .find
[01:43:24] <puddlefish> so class 1 OR class 2 AND class 3 OR class 4 :x
[01:43:36] <MrBenn> Ah I see
[01:43:43] <alex88> Ortund: the problem is that #player_template:first child which you wanted to add class to, is cloned on page load elsewhere, so if i use that class i'll get multiple elements
[01:43:58] <igore> puddlefish, did you try jQuery('.class').find('.class_children')
[01:44:40] <Ortund> alex88: #player_template:first
[01:44:47] <filename> anyone works with dynatree?
[01:45:06] <igore> Can anyone give me a hand with .wrap method
[01:45:19] <filename> i wonder how to get all the options i checked in dynatree when i post my form
[01:45:24] <Ortund> alex88, if that's not what you're looking for then I really don't know...
[01:46:05] <MrBenn> Puddlefish, what do you want to achieve with your class filter?
[01:47:26] <alex88> Ortund: #player_template:first.html() returns same as #player_template.html()
[01:47:30] <alex88> Ortund: but it's ok
[01:47:37] <alex88> Ortund: thanks!
[01:48:49] <puddlefish> it's for filtering products. i have a list of checkboxes (for filtering), the id's of these consist of a type and value. the actual product listing has classes appended to them (which are essentially the id's of the checkboxes - as classes)
[01:49:07] <Blaster> anyone know how to reset an animated gif ?
[01:49:17] <puddlefish> when a checkbox is clicked it basically needs to filter which products have the selected classes
[01:49:47] <Cork> Blaster: i remember that its tricky
[01:50:08] <Ortund> alex88 so still not what you're trying to achieve?
[01:50:24] <Blaster> Cork:  I have a solution for FF but in IE it doesn't work
[01:51:10] <Cork> Blaster: if i remember correctly you need to add a timestamp after the url so it fetches a new copy
[01:51:20] <alex88> Ortund: well, actually i get the clearfix element, but with the surrounding div... if i use #player_template or #player_template:first... semms buggy to me
[01:51:49] <Cork> Blaster: it sucks big time, but i think thats the only way to really force it
[01:51:58] <Gisterogue> puddlefish: So in jQuery OR is , and AND you just appent - but you're looking for a way to group the ORs
[01:52:14] <Gisterogue> *sets of ors
[01:52:20] <puddlefish> yeah ;D
[01:53:29] <Gisterogue> i.e. #cb1,#cb2,#cb3 is group 1, #cb4,#cb4,#cb6 and you want to AND them two
[01:54:09] <puddlefish> yep exactly that
[01:54:17] <Gisterogue> something like (#cb1,#cb2,#cb3)(#cb4,#cb5,#cb6) -< but valid :P
[01:54:43] <Cork> Gisterogue: theres a name for that, class
[01:54:45] <Cork> :)
[01:54:54] <alex88> Ortund: got it working $("#player_template").find('.clearfix').parent().html() ;)
[01:54:57] <Cork> just add a class grouping them togeather
[01:55:50] <Gisterogue> Cork: Yes, if only it were that simple
[01:56:01] <Gisterogue> :P
[01:56:02] <Ortund> alex88 derp I should've thought of that haha, nice job :)
[01:56:16] <puddlefish> i already have a set of classes - for example sake - .class1 .class2. class3
[01:56:18] <Cork> Gisterogue: you arn't allowed to change the dom structure?
[01:56:36] <alex88> Ortund: a bit tricky but it works :) thank you :)
[01:57:07] <puddlefish> i need something like this : (.class1, .class2, .class3) . (.class4, .class5, .class6)
[01:57:11] <Ortund> nps :) btw, you should standardize your quotes, either "" or ''
[01:57:32] <puddlefish> class1 OR class2 OR class3 AND class4 OR class5 OR class6
[01:57:39] <Cork> puddlefish: so ad a class1-1 and class2-5 or something
[01:57:44] <Cork> 'add
[01:57:48] <Ortund> alex88: I've got to be honest, I don't see  any difference to other tests I tried though
[01:58:34] <puddlefish> i don't understand how that can work
[01:58:49] <Gisterogue> If you have a set of options in a group that you can filter by, let's say price: 0-5$, 6-10$, 11+$ and another of colour: red, blue, green. You selected 0-5 and 6-10, blue and green
[01:59:11] <alex88> Ortund: well, this result gives only <div class="clearfix"></div> those tests gives the <div><div class="clearfix"></div></div> element... i just don't get why using :first-child returns null
[01:59:14] <Cork> puddlefish: the normal solution is to add an extra class for each combination of element you need to work with
[01:59:24] <Gisterogue> ouch :/
[01:59:36] <Cork> puddlefish: then you only have to handle that when you create the element
[01:59:45] <puddlefish> that could mean hundreds of elements on each class, that's not really feasible :x
[01:59:50] <puddlefish> err
[01:59:52] <Cork> alternativly you need heavy and complex selectors
[01:59:54] <puddlefish> classes on each element sorry
[02:00:12] <Ortund> alex88 you got me... I haven't seen :first-child until you asked your question
[02:00:41] <alex88> Ortund: well, if it's buggy as you've seen, forget it immediatly :D

[02:02:29] <XMan2012> i am looking for jquery form slider where i can divide my form in multi stages
[02:03:40] <XMan2012> something like this ...http://www.tree-nation.com/register
[02:14:18] <Vivid> hello
[02:14:27] <chee> hello
[02:14:34] <tomatau> hi
[02:14:39] <chee> tomatau: hi
[02:14:42] <Vivid> noob question, how would I call a function on rollover?
[02:14:51] <sgronblo> Why on earth did qunit put actual as the first argument and expected as the second...
[02:14:52] <Vivid> or 2 functions?
[02:15:00] <tomatau> chee, hello
[02:15:26] <sgronblo> The docs even mention "equivalent to JUnit's assertEquals"... moron...
[02:15:27] <chee> Vivid: $('#lololol').hover(function(){ /* lololol */ });
[02:15:54] <Vivid> and 2 functions?
[02:16:03] <tomatau> vivid, $('a.rollover-action').hover(function())
[02:16:18] <Vivid> where would I put the function name in there?
[02:16:29] <tomatau> make a function that executes two functions?
[02:16:29] <Deele> Vivid: you can put inside function(){ /* lololol */ } whatever you like
[02:16:43] <quicksilver> you can just use a function name too, though
[02:16:53] <quicksilver> $('#foo').hover(myhoverfunc)
[02:17:09] <quicksilver> it's not required to use function() { } for every callback :)
[02:17:11] <Vivid> cool quicksilver, thanks all
[02:17:24] <Deele> $('#foo').hover(function() { function1(); function2(); })
[02:17:44] <Vivid> can I call 2 functions at once using this kind of thing... $('#foo').hover(myhoverfunc)?
[02:17:47] <Ortund> http://pop.netgendns.co.za/Work.aspx       <<< View Gallery brings up a modal with the gallery on it, can anyone suggest a way to smooth the image swaps on the main image in the middle?
[02:17:57] <Deele> Vivid: ('#foo').hover(function() { function1(); function2(); })
[02:18:01] <Vivid> deele, i'll try that
[02:18:08] <Vivid> thanks a lot
[02:18:32] <Ortund> I'm looking for a fadeIn or animation of some sort
[02:18:36] <Deele> Vivid: $('#foo').hover(myhoverfunc) will work only if your myhoverfunc does not need any specific input
[02:18:40] <Ortund> but I don't know how to implement it
[02:18:45] <quicksilver> incidentally, hover takes two parameters
[02:18:56] <quicksilver> one function when the hover starts and one when it finishes.
[02:19:02] <Deele> Ortund: http://api.jquery.com/fadein/
[02:19:07] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[02:22:20] <SargoDarya_> I don't know if I'm just stupid but is it somehow possible to bind a value to a dom object? So when I have an object Game with the property time and update Game.time it will update a displayed value without having to do a manual $('DOMobj').html(Game.time);
[02:22:53] <Ortund> Deele: Fade looks like it's work ok, but you can't do it if the element you're fading is always visible on the page.
[02:25:13] <WebDragon> SargoDarya_: tried .data() ?
[02:25:40] <quicksilver> SargoDarya_: no. Make it a function.
[02:25:52] <quicksilver> SargoDarya_: get used to calling Game.time(newtime) instead of Game.time = newtime.
[02:26:04] <quicksilver> (and make your function update whatever DOM objs, obviously)
[02:26:22] <filename> fucking dynatree
[02:26:28] <filename> the stupidest jquery plugin
[02:26:31] <SargoDarya_> that's horrible. really.
[02:26:41] <SargoDarya_> There must be a better way
[02:27:15] <chee> it's not horrible
[02:27:17] <edgardo> do any of you have any idea why the jquery ui isn't working at all? Here is my setup: http://jsfiddle.net/qP8k4/ (I know it isn't supposed to work in jsfiddle, but that's how I've set it up on my local computer)
[02:27:18] <Ortund> haha how's that for a work around... on each click event to change the current image, I'm hiding most things and fading them in
[02:27:56] <edgardo> and all files do exist, I have triple-checked them ;X
[02:28:47] <SargoDarya_> chee: it's not horrible for you because you probably never worked with something different where you can just bind to an object and it will automatically update the view or the object, depending on what changes
[02:29:04] <sahbeewah> edgardo: seems to be working what's the problem?
[02:29:06] <chee> lol
[02:29:28] <edgardo> not here
[02:29:41] <edgardo> it isn't draggable at all
[02:29:48] <edgardo> ie sortable
[02:29:59] <sahbeewah> check the jquery ui checkbox
[02:30:00] <quicksilver> SargoDarya_: Game.time isn't an object, it's a variable.
[02:30:23] <SargoDarya_> "with the property time"
[02:30:26] <quicksilver> SargoDarya_: you can set up all kinds of bindings and stuff for objects if you like, but plain assignment is plain assignment.
[02:30:41] <quicksilver> and javascript doesn't have overloading.
[02:30:59] <SargoDarya_> It's not overloading... I found something where it does exactly what I want.
[02:31:30] <quicksilver> overloading would be a technique for making '=' do something magic.
[02:31:39] <SargoDarya_> Yes, I know
[02:31:42] <quicksilver> but in javascript = is plain assignment and Game.time is just a variable.
[02:31:43] <edgardo> sahbeewah, what the? ;D I just downlaoded the newest files from jqueryui.com and included them in my folder. But still isn't working, what could I be doing wrong here
[02:31:52] <quicksilver> you can't change this. But it's easy to use a method instead.
[02:31:58] <yamahaalex37> is it pretty easy to designate a window as a variable?
[02:32:07] <quicksilver> foo.setTime(newtime) is not really any different from foo.time = newtime.
[02:32:09] <yamahaalex37> if im building something like ExtJS
[02:32:13] <SargoDarya_> Gah... you haven't really understood what I'm after
[02:32:20] <SargoDarya_> http://knockoutjs.com/examples/helloWorld.html
[02:32:23] <quicksilver> I have. YOu haven't understood me.
[02:32:33] <edgardo> you only need jquery.js and jqueryui.js right? I even checked all the options in jqueryui.com to make sure I wasn't missing anything
[02:32:33] <quicksilver> but I'm bored of this conversation, sorry. It's off-topic too.
[02:32:48] <yamahaalex37> i want to say if link opened, and if window closed, open new window
[02:32:48] <sahbeewah> edgardo: http://jsfiddle.net/qP8k4/1/
[02:33:11] <yamahaalex37> but if #window open, open link in that window
[02:33:16] <yamahaalex37> window is a div
[02:33:29] <yamahaalex37> i want users to be able to hit X to close divs
[02:33:35] <igore> Trying to wrap element using .wrap() and its not working.
[02:33:52] <SargoDarya_> Why would this be off-topic if I'm asking if there is an jquery way of observing the value of a DOM element or changing the DOM elements value when the variable changes? Seriously
[02:33:56] <edgardo> sahbeewah, that's what I tried and worked.
[02:34:07] <edgardo> but trying to figure out why it isn't working on my local computer
[02:34:34] <edgardo> when I try to grab an li, it just starts to select stuff and it's not moving at all
[02:35:00] <quicksilver> SargoDarya_: the discussion about javascript assignment being plain assignment is off-topic, is what I meant.
[02:35:09] <sahbeewah> depending on what is in drag.js, probably because you included it before including the jquery files
[02:35:12] <yamahaalex37> is it possible to say IF div open, onClick, open page in div
[02:35:13] <yamahaalex37> <yamahaalex37> if div closed, open new div
[02:35:24] <SargoDarya_> I'm not even frickin talking about plain assignments. That's what you said
[02:35:35] <sahbeewah> probably because the files aren't being included properly
[02:35:36] <sahbeewah> etc
[02:35:37] <edgardo> sahbeewah, haha yeah. that did the trick :)
[02:35:44] <edgardo> it was included before
[02:35:51] <edgardo> didn't know that made a difference :)
[02:36:43] <edgardo> I was already humming to Queen - I'm Going Slightly Mad
[02:37:08] <sahbeewah> SargoDarya_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/watch
[02:37:50] <SargoDarya_> I think I'm either going to write a plugin for it or use knockout.js
[02:38:35] <sahbeewah> https://gist.github.com/384583
[02:39:43] <SargoDarya_> Thanks sahbeewah, will definitely look into this
[02:39:53] <igore> I've created a jQuery plugin that takes a collection of elements and binds some click events, and adds some classes. I would also like to wrap each element in the collection with a <div>. I'm using .wrap() and it doesn't work. I think its due to the way I'm returning or dealing with the elements in the collector.
[02:41:11] <someoneme> Hi all. I have a div id="mydiv" element, with the CSS #mydiv { width: 100% }. $('#mydiv').width() returns me 100, and looking at the code it seems that .width() only reads css value. However, the doc says it will return a unit-agnostic pixel value. Is there a known workaround to get acutal width in pixels of my element?
[02:42:49] <quicksilver> sahbeewah, SargoDarya_ : ok well that is very interesting! I didn't know about the __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ stuff
[02:42:59] <quicksilver> I wonder if that really is fully cross-browser
[02:43:30] <ablomen> someoneme, it should return the actual width, try making a test case at http://jsfiddle.net and post the link
[02:44:03] <SargoDarya_> quicksilver: a console.log in every browser shows you the __proto__ methods for each object. it usually has those two methods in it and methods like toString and stuff like that
[02:44:20] <quicksilver> SargoDarya_: yes, but I wonder about browsers liek IE7 and IE6
[02:44:31] <quicksilver> SargoDarya_: where it's not so easy to console.log...
[02:45:26] <SargoDarya_> Can't test them. IE6 is way beyond what I support. I barely support IE7 as I'm either on Mac or Ubuntu and can't test my JS there. I just know how to write CSS which looks the same on every browser
[02:46:03] <sahbeewah> someoneme: .width() does return the pixel value
[02:46:34] <sahbeewah> probably just coincidentally 100px
[02:46:49] <igore> @ sahbeewah & someoneme: i'm using width() in my code and I get px value
[02:47:03] <yamahaalex37> is it possible to make something IMPOSSIBLE to drag off screen or viewprot with jQ?
[02:47:06] <yamahaalex37> or jquery UI
[02:47:24] <igore> yes, look at jQuery UI
[02:47:33] <yamahaalex37> every example ive seen you can kinda throw stuff out of bounds
[02:47:39] <igore> I think you can snap to grid..
[02:47:41] <yamahaalex37> or just slide it, and the scroll bars expand
[02:47:46] <igore> or make only draggable inside an element
[02:48:04] <yamahaalex37> yeah but when its draggable inside that element, and you move outside of it, it always seems to disappear behind
[02:48:10] <yamahaalex37> or slide too far
[02:48:30] <igore> that is because the element is appended to body probably
[02:49:00] <yamahaalex> check it out
[02:49:02] <sahbeewah> there's a containment attribute in the draggable object
[02:49:10] <yamahaalex> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/snap-to.html
[02:49:10] <sahbeewah> that you can set
[02:49:13] <igore> if you were able to have this inside a containing element, then maybe you can prevent the scroll bars from showing..
[02:49:35] <yamahaalex> ok but even then, drag it up top
[02:49:40] <yamahaalex> you can take it out of bounds
[02:50:00] <yamahaalex> ive not seen one example where this is not the case
[02:50:04] <igore> you might want to take a look at that snap-to link yamahaalex posted
[02:50:20] <yamahaalex> that is snap to, the link i poseted?
[02:50:23] <yamahaalex> oh i am yamahaalex37
[02:50:34] <igore> yes, hehe..
[02:50:39] <yamahaalex> i think it may purposefully be a web feature, to prevent hackers locking mouse in box? lol
[02:50:49] <igore> and I am way past my bed time..
[02:51:09] <yamahaalex> maybe write a script that forces drop if mouse is 5% from edge?
[02:51:19] <yamahaalex> but if you go reallly fast, i think it will still fly out of bounds
[02:51:38] <igore> unless you recognize the mouse speed
[02:51:43] <igore> and drop the object right away at hight speeds
[02:51:53] <igore> don't let it get dragged when the mouse is jerked..
[02:51:58] <igore> only a proper drag speed
[02:52:09] <Vivid> guys, thanks for your help earlier, I've taken it to this stage. Can you take a look at my code and see if there's anything wrong. It's probably messy and not efficient... http://jsfiddle.net/NJPhH/
[02:52:27] <igore> so you can do what you said, have a script drop the box when it gets close to the edges
[02:53:18] <igore> vivid, looks good to me, but I might not be what you call an expert. I just "dabble"
[02:53:29] <yamahaalex> k thanks igore

[02:58:01] <Muimi> so I tried to use coords[j] and use a for loop to have j++.  It gave me 'undefined'
[02:58:06] <Muimi> Any ideas?
[03:00:29] <someoneme> ablomen, sahbeewah: Thanks for answering. However, the width is not incidentally 100px (it is actually over 1000, if I trust firebug). But strangely enough, a simple test case is giving back an appropriate value in pixels. Will try to look at it deeper.

[03:49:28] <rohit00082002> it just I pasted
[03:50:07] <ciro_nunes> where it's from?
[03:50:23] <rohit00082002> this is an facebook application
[03:50:27] <rohit00082002> http://apps.facebook.com/119103174841572/
[03:50:41] <Ortund> rohit00082002 you have hard coded values in there, of course it will always send the same data
[03:51:55] <rohit00082002> I am using   onclick = uploadToOi915(j) and it sends last event in  j if it has 3 events
[03:52:05] <Ortund> oh wait, nevermind, I just noticed you're passing your function's parameter
[03:52:15] <rohit00082002> Yes
[03:53:17] <Ortund> rohit00082002, can you include your onclick code?
[03:53:54] <rohit00082002> in pastebin line 13
[03:54:38] <Ortund> rohit00082002 that defines the function, it doesn't show me what data you're sending to the function
[03:58:01] <rohit00082002> data is user's events
[03:58:30] <rohit00082002> on pastebin line 5 &callback=finalPrint';
[03:58:49] <rohit00082002> user's created events on facebook
[03:59:07] <shwaiil> Q: how to prevent window to go up when clicking or something ? thanks note: I mean moving up to top
[03:59:38] <Ortund> shwaiil can you provide an example of the behavior you want to prevent?
[03:59:48] <shwaiil> preventDefault I think..but if other let me know :)
[03:59:58] <shwaiil> Ortund: tks for looking. when clicking, sometimes the position on window goes up
[04:00:01] <shwaiil> the start of dom
[04:00:39] <Ortund> I saw your question, don't know exactly what you're talking about, can you show me an example?
[04:01:42] <shwaiil> Ortund: yeah, http://jsfiddle.net/35vFv/22/
[04:01:48] <wild_oscar> hey. do you know why Eclipse complains on jquery.min.js files' validation?  I have, for example, 3 errors on 1.7. eg: Syntax error on token "Invalid Regular Expression Options", no accurate correction available	jquery-1.7.min.js	line
[04:01:58] <shwaiil> if u click in the radio btns, the window position will go to top
[04:02:13] <wild_oscar> or Syntax error, insert ")" to complete Arguments
[04:02:40] <shwaiil> Ortund: I guess its just the new element being displayed, that made it look it goes up
[04:02:41] <shwaiil> :P
[04:02:42] <shwaiil> sorry
[04:03:21] <Ortund> shwaiil the sumbit input type submits the form, this causes the page to post information back to the server which essentially triggers a refresh
[04:04:03] <shwaiil> Ortund: yeah but in this case I'm preventing that to happen while validating, the issue was a new element coming up, sorry and tks for your atention :X
[04:05:22] <AdvoWork> Hi there, whats the quickest function to load a page into a div? or doesnt it really matter? looking for seamless page loading with navigation
[04:05:38] <JesperA> .load
[04:07:01] <wild_oscar> this only happens in the mini version
[04:07:02] <rohit00082002> hello mine also please
[04:12:01] <smooki> hi
[04:15:33] <alex88> hi guys, i'm trying to do this demo http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html, downloaded jquery ui custom with all plugins, jquery 1.7.1 and it gives me error at line 76 of that demo, error is Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'addClass'
[04:16:14] <dr0id> why do people come here all day asking for help ? can't we have some nice discussions ?
[04:16:37] <Cork> dr0id: its a coding channel, its basically what its about :)
[04:17:19] <rohit00082002> :) dr0id  pls pls pls u gues are expersts for  giving help to we newwiebs :)
[04:17:25] <Cork> alex88: do you have jquery included?
[04:17:34] <Umren> alex88: maybe u included jqueryui before jquery?
[04:17:38] <dr0id> lol
[04:18:19] <alex88> Cork: Umren: yup jquery is loaded and before jquery ui, else it would fail before that addclass, isn't it?
[04:19:03] <Cork> alex88: depends on the code
[04:19:20] <alex88> Cork: script is a copy-paste of the demo
[04:19:21] <Cork> alex88: could you pb what you've tried to use?
[04:20:01] <AdvoWork> whats the quickest function to load a page into a div? or doesnt it really matter? looking for seamless page loading with navigation, BUT if i need to pass a string like section=Orders&action=create_order  which will then say which file to use?
[04:20:51] <rohit00082002> ok I simplefied my pastebin now thhis is it
[04:20:52] <rohit00082002> http://pastebin.com/nAsB7teA
[04:21:31] <alex88> Cork: ofc http://pastebin.com/iTaP3zDX
[04:21:40] <alex88> brb lunch time, write in the meanwhile
[04:21:43] <rohit00082002> in upload2() function it was supposed to have alerts as 0 , 1 or so
[04:21:45] <Cork> rohit00082002: ugg i see loads of problems there
[04:21:55] <rohit00082002> but it always alerts last number 3
[04:22:37] <rohit00082002> what problems
[04:22:42] <Cork> rohit00082002: 1. don't use inline event handles, 2. quotes around values, 3. no space between key and value, and most important 4. declare your variables
[04:22:51] <Cork> d becomes a global variable
[04:23:29] <Cork> opps same with ur_test2
[04:24:24] <rohit00082002> ya same error
[04:25:07] <rohit00082002> please tell good code. so that I will understand it for all future
[04:25:17] <rohit00082002> this is bad code I got it.
[04:27:22] <Cork> alex88: line 153 might have something to do with it :)
[04:27:47] <Cork> rohit00082002: html should always be key="value"
[04:27:56] <Cork> rohit00082002: not key = value
[04:28:30] <Cork> rohit00082002: in your function your creating a bunch of new varaibles, but you don't declare them (var), that means they becoms globals
[04:28:41] <Cork> and that has a tendency to create all form of bugs
[04:29:05] <rohit00082002> means should do  var d = data;
[04:29:05] <Cork> rohit00082002: same problem down the the for loop
[04:29:09] <Cork> yes
[04:29:18] <Cork> and for(var t=0;
[04:29:21] <Cork> and so on
[04:29:29] <rohit00082002> ok
[04:30:03] <Cork> thirdly you should use .click/.bind/.live/delegate/.on instead of on*="" inline attributes in the html
[04:30:27] <Newie> Hi there
[04:30:29] <Newie>  Does anyone know how to access my object reference before im using the second function? Normaly i can use $(this).... when i'm working only in one function. for example. jQuery('a').click(function{ jQuery('div#content_right').fadeOut(1000, function(){ }); }), in my fadeOut function i dont know how to get the reference of my clicked object. sorry for my bad english and explication
[04:30:52] <Cork> rohit00082002: especially as your trying to access the d value thats local to that function
[04:31:18] <Cork> rohit00082002: onclick in the html will only access the global scope, and there you can only have one d
[04:31:42] <devnill> newie: do you mean something like .parent()?
[04:31:46] <rohit00082002> yes last value of d always
[04:32:08] <Cork> rohit00082002: yes cause d is a global variable and your resetting it on each iteration through the loop
[04:32:41] <Cork> rohit00082002: so when the click event happens it will only refer to d globaly, that will be the value of the latest iteration through the loop
[04:33:25] <Cork> rohit00082002: and finally i hate to see ppl using href="#" or href="javascript:void(0)"
[04:33:33] <SargoDarya_> I guess Amazon has Christmas shopping prices now >.> Holy fuck... http://amzn.to/rw9wTl
[04:33:45] <SargoDarya_> Cork++ I hate href="#" too
[04:33:47] <Cork> rohit00082002: use <span tabindex="0" class="link"></span>
[04:34:02] <Cork> then style your "fake" links with the .link class
[04:34:30] <Cork> tabindex will still give it tabbable focus so no loss compared to links
[04:35:03] <rohit00082002> o gr8  ok , and is valid for IE also ?
[04:35:10] <Cork> yes
[04:35:36] <Cork> i know its valid all the way back to ie4
[04:35:43] <Cork> don't think anyone cares before that :)
[04:36:14] <rohit00082002> yes me mose old now in use prob is IE7
[04:36:39] <Cork> ie6 is still common enough to cause problems
[04:36:49] <Cork> but ya, they are finnaly forced out :)
[04:36:59] <Newie> @devnil: the problem is my link list is gernerated with php and each link is loading different content
[04:37:09] <rohit00082002> yes must
[04:37:33] <Newie> so i need the correct object when im clicking on it
[04:39:46] <prodn> how do you actually post something using jQuery without making it AJAX? er... I want to use $.post(), but I also want the window.location to change and the site to reload, if it makes sense
[04:40:11] <Zogot> then why use post?
[04:40:15] <Zogot> why not just normal html?
[04:40:20] <Zogot> and forms
[04:40:45] <Cork> Newie: save the this variable
[04:40:52] <Newie> .load(jQuery(this).attr('rel')) this have to use the attribute "rel" of my clicked anchor and not the attribute of my div container
[04:40:58] <prodn> um...because I am saving all the selections from a list in javascript vars. How can I get these items to another page?
[04:41:00] <Newie> omg
[04:41:01] <Newie> thats it -.-
[04:41:06] <Newie> thank u
[04:41:07] <Cork> Newie: do something like var $self = $(this); then use $self in the fade out
[04:41:16] <Cork> np
[04:42:14] <Cork> prodn: if you want a document reload, you need to generate a hidden form and form.submit() it
[04:42:29] <Cork> prodn: or use get variables (parameters)
[04:43:00] <Newie> lol ...  like not being able to see the wood for trees
[04:43:04] <Newie> thx again
[04:44:03] <inki> shouldn't a default jquery ui dialog close be escape?
[04:44:06] <inki> *close by
[04:44:58] <prodn> Cork: I have this huge list without checkboxes. You just click the items in the list for them to get highligetd. Everything is svaed in javascript array or variables. How can I get these to another page? I know how I could do it in AJAX, that is $.post("newpage.php",{ save: all_the_things_I_want_to_save })
[04:46:00] <Cork> prodn: wrap them in a <form> with no action attribute
[04:46:03] <hariom> I want to create a dialog box that will have a search box and will display search results once the search is made. This dialog box will appear when a button is clicked on the main page. Where should I write the dialog box html and js? If I write in main page, it will display in the main page itself.
[04:46:24] <mathi> hi
[04:46:27] <Cork> prodn: when you want to submit them do set action="new-url" on the form and .submit() it
[04:46:43] <prodn> how can I get all_the_things_I_want_to_save to the other site?
[04:47:01] <mathi> to get the visible elements I can do $('tr.hole').is(':visible') or $('tr.hole:visible'), right ? which is the most performant ?
[04:47:12] <Cork> prodn: see my last two responses
[04:47:52] <Cork> mathi: the first one
[04:47:59] <Cork> not by much, but a little
[04:48:17] <Cork> mathi: if you can do use a class instead, its much better performance
[04:48:28] <mathi> a class ?
[04:48:40] <prodn> Cork: it's not a form because it's not checkboxes. It's a table with rows. I know I could do <form> and .submit(), but how do I actually pass on my variable to the other site when the page reloads?
[04:48:41] <Cork> so something like tr.hole.visible, or .hidden
[04:48:59] <prodn> when I click a <tr>, that row gets into the variable
[04:49:04] <Cork> prodn: well you will have to create a hidden form if you want to replace the page
[04:49:12] <Cork> prodn: there is no other way
[04:49:23] <mathi> i see,t hank you
[04:49:41] <hariom> Where should one write dialog box html and js? Should it be written in the separate page?
[04:50:02] <hariom> My dialog box is going to hold lot of HTML
[04:50:10] <Cork> hariom: your missing about half the context :D
[04:50:14] <prodn> Cork: so using AJAX here would be _much_ easier? Becuase then I can just pass on whatever variable I want to whatever page I want
[04:50:16] <Cork> what are you trying to do=
[04:50:17] <Cork> *?
[04:50:26] <hariom> Cork:I want to create a dialog box that will have a search box and will display search results once the search is made. This dialog box will appear when a button is clicked on the main page. Where should I write the dialog box html and js? If I write in main page, it will display in the main page itself.
[04:50:36] <Cork> prodn: i would say no
[04:50:44] <Cork> prodn: generating a form is easy
[04:51:07] <mathi> and somewhere in the element there is an element that I need to select, should I use find, closest, ... ?
[04:51:17] <Cork> hariom: what server code are you using?
[04:51:28] <hariom> server code?
[04:51:43] <hariom> Cork: didn't get what you mean by server code
[04:51:47] <AdvoWork> I keep getting this error Error: $("#dialog").dialog is not a function  but ive included jquery ui, and the div dialog exists. Any ideas?
[04:51:49] <Cork> hariom: you most likly want it loaded in the final page pushed to the client, that will give a much better experience
[04:52:06] <hariom> Cork: you mean via ajax?
[04:52:21] <Cork> hariom: server code, as what your using to generate the html (php, python, nodejs, RoR, ...)
[04:52:41] <hariom> python
[04:52:49] <hariom> Cork: python
[04:53:12] <rohit00082002> may ok now I changed some as per you said, only 2 things now remaining
[04:53:14] <rohit00082002> http://pastebin.com/E0g5GFLz
[04:53:27] <Cork> hariom: well use a separat file if you like, make sure you put it in the page when its sent to the client
[04:53:58] <Cork> AdvoWork: what does $.ui.version show?
[04:53:59] <rohit00082002> how to send json values inseatd of t. and how to use .bind as you were saying earlier please.
[04:54:28] <Cork> rohit00082002: you still have the inline click event, that works in the global scope
[04:54:55] <rohit00082002> yes, how to avoid it ?
[04:55:07] <rohit00082002> I mean .bind ? how to
[04:55:46] <mathi> :(((  $("tr.hole").is(":visible").each is not a function
[04:56:16] <mathi> help I can't select the element
[04:56:18] <Cork> rohit00082002: http://pastebin.com/Vgy7dr9w
[04:56:55] <mathi> I want to select the visible elements but it doesn't work for me
[04:57:19] <Cork> mathi: you want has not is
[04:57:26] <Cork> mathi: is returns true or false
[04:57:41] <Cork> .has @ mathi
[04:57:47] <Cork> opps
[04:57:49] <Cork> ?.has @ mathi
[04:57:49] <bot-t> mathi, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[04:58:39] <Cork> rohit00082002: woops i forgot to replace d with data in the pb
[04:58:45] <mathi> Cork, it works with filter
[04:58:47] <Cork> (line 10)
[04:59:22] <rohit00082002> ok  :)
[05:00:58] <Cork> mathi: heh it looks like has has been depricated >_>
[05:01:05] <Cork> missed that completly :s
[05:01:42] <Cork> oh wait no there it is
[05:01:42] <mathi> Cork, which one?
[05:02:01] <Cork> na nothing i just mixed things up
[05:02:14] <Cork> and ya has is the wrong function
[05:05:45] <mathi> Cork, I remember I lost once several days with ":visible", it's not always 100% accurate, depending on OS and browser of user. I had reported a bug about it. I will add class "visible" instead
[05:06:27] <Cork> mathi: its cause it tries to check the css state of display and vilibility
[05:07:10] <Cork> mathi: i never use it cause it needs manu checks and is flanky for just that reason
[05:07:21] <Cork> mathi: and reproducing it through a class is easy
[05:07:29] <Cork> and much more stable
[05:07:49] <mathi> Cork, but it's buggy, I had once a user having problems on my application because for all user "is visible" returned true, and for him it returned false
[05:08:28] <mathi> so yes for that specific case I'll use a class
[05:09:22] <prodn> Cork: how do I pass on the values using a <form>? Do I have to make a hidden <input> for it to pass or is there a way with js/jQeuery?
[05:11:21] <rohit00082002> hey +Cork s much thankyou your code is working perfectly with json data passed as parameter too
[05:14:54] <ximarin> hi all, this is a jqueryui-question: does anyone know what the "18" in "ui-bg_diagonals-thick_18_b81900_40x40.png" means? I try to create an own ui-state-style which works fine except for the image. I created an image that is named exaclty like this one, except taht i used other color-codes
[05:15:26] <Muimi> Anybody catch that q i posted earlier?
[05:16:25] <Muimi> I'm wondering, if I have like <map name="map"><coord></coord><coord></coord></map>, how do I reference coord[0] and coord[1]?
[05:16:50] <Muimi> sorry i mean area
[05:18:06] <Muimi> $('#title').append($('.class #id area').attr('coords') + "<br />"); works
[05:18:23] <Muimi> but $('#title').append($('.class #id area[0]').attr('coords') + "<br />"); does not work
[05:23:18] <jeffsmykil> if I can make an item droppable by doing $(".selector").droppable
[05:23:26] <jeffsmykil> how do I make it un-droppable>
[05:26:17] <squeakytoy> hey all, is it possible to use selectors/finding elements within a certatin string with jquery? seems like $(selector) searches in the whole dom. I just want it searching inside my string. Is that even possible?
[05:26:57] <Muimi> yeah dude.  just use javascript
[05:27:04] <alex88> Cork: sorry, that line is only in the paste... btw yeh line 153 gives that error
[05:27:09] <Muimi> they talk about it in chapter 2 or 3 of eloquent javascript
[05:28:44] <arvindravi> hello all, when my page is loaded it goes directly to the end of the page automatically,How do i fix this?
[05:29:03] <squeakytoy> why does it do that?
[05:29:44] <antdillon> Im using getJSON to load a json within the same directory but its triggering the error function? Does anyone know why or how to check what error it is?
[05:34:18] <angheloko> hi guys... i'm checking out some codes for my friend. May I know what this line means: Drupal.fbconnect = Drupal.fbconnect || {}; ... Thanks!
[05:34:31] <jeffsmykil> anyone making a selector un-droppable?
[05:35:11] <jeffsmykil> aha
[05:35:16] <jeffsmykil> droppable('disable')
[05:40:10] <Muimi> @squeakytoy use slice, man.
[05:40:18] <squeakytoy> slice? hm
[05:40:41] <Muimi> Yeah if you check out the manual page on it or read about it in Eloquent Javascript, you'll be really happy, I think.  I'm pretty sure it's Chapter 3.
[05:41:08] <squeakytoy> im not sure how slice can help me
[05:41:08] <Muimi> http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter4.html
[05:41:11] <prodn> So I made a <form> and I want to submit it with jQuery. So far so good. I want to be able to manipulate the action depending on which link I click to submit. Also okay. But how can I post some data to the target of the action?
[05:41:57] <Muimi> Well that's just how I remember it.
[05:42:14] <prodn> isn't there some kind of post-variable I can mess with before it gets processed in the action?
[05:42:25] <Muimi> It's Ex. 4.4, squeakytoy
[05:42:39] <Muimi> function startsWith(string, pattern)
[05:43:00] <Cork> prodn: nope
[05:43:03] <Muimi> And there's another function called 'endsWith' that would be useful, you know?
[05:43:22] <squeakytoy> Muimi: you must have me confused with another guy here
[05:43:48] <woozly> how to send multiple data with $.ajax? I mean, I need to send serialized form and add some values else
[05:44:08] <woozly> $.ajax({ .. data: $("#myform").serialize(); but how to add some values?
[05:44:13] <Muimi> I thought you wanted to search a string for a string.
[05:44:17] <Muimi> Like regex or something
[05:44:41] <Cork> woozly: you need to use serializeArray, then extend it
[05:45:14] <Muimi> Alright.  Angheloko got it. :)
[05:45:18] <prodn> Cork: so how do I do this? Do I first put the variable to an input and then post it or what? I really read what you said before, but I didn't understand or it didn't really answered my question.
[05:45:19] <Cork> $.extend([], $("#myform").serializeArray();, [{key:'val'}])
[05:45:53] <Cork> opps extra ; in there
[05:46:16] <Cork> prodn: i'm getting tired of answering that one question
[05:46:27] <Cork> "create a hidden form"
[05:46:34] <prodn> Cork: yes I sense that. :(
[05:46:39] <prodn> I created a hidden form
[05:46:40] <Cork> add inputs for the data you want to send
[05:46:47] <Cork> and submit it
[05:46:51] <Muimi> Someone answered my question in another channel.
[05:46:56] <Muimi> The answer was to use .eq(j)
[05:47:09] <Cork> Muimi: ya i did ;P
[05:47:58] <Muimi> Oh.  Thanks. :)
[05:48:08] <Cork> lol
[05:48:23] <Muimi> :) I'm learning the DOM.  I never thought it would be so useful.
[05:48:37] <Cork> :D

[05:49:53] <Cork> Muimi: you won't hit it until you try to handly really much data in it
[05:50:20] <Muimi> That's good to know.  I hope to keep it at a minimum.
[05:50:25] <Cork> Muimi: unfocused
[05:50:25] <Muimi> :)
[05:50:36] <Cork> just unfocused >_<
[05:50:42] <Muimi> Well, I owe you a beer.  Maybe no one would have answered.

[05:56:55] <risky_s> hi, I am trying to make a div show when the result of two radio buttons are clicked to 'No'
[05:57:04] <risky_s> do i need a live function???
[05:57:21] <edzjins> hi
[05:59:08] <AdvoWork> I keep getting this error Error: $("#dialog").dialog is not a function  but ive included jquery ui, and the div dialog exists. Any ideas? ive got the latest version of jquery ui with all components ticked when I downloaded it
[06:00:21] <Cork> AdvoWork: you never asnwerd waht does $.ui.version show?
[06:00:26] <Cork> *what
[06:00:58] <Cork> ex. run it as console.log($.ui.version) where you try to call the dialog
[06:01:34] <shwaiil> Q: let's say I have some elements of same type of class "A", how to select by index nr ? for examle <li class="A">1</li><li class="B">1</li>, tks for looking! ;D
[06:02:53] <Cork> shwaiil: $('.A').index()
[06:02:57] <squeakytoy> anyone know if you can define the buttons, directly with html, when using the jquery ui dialog?
[06:03:32] <Cork> shwaiil: btw index number?
[06:03:39] <Cork> select by what?
[06:03:45] <shwaiil> Cork: tks for looking
[06:03:52] <shwaiil> lets say I'm doing a foreach loop on .A elements
[06:04:07] <shwaiil> I know each key, so..how would I get each element by that value ?
[06:04:23] <Cork> and the key is?
[06:04:33] <Cork> its position in the list?
[06:05:07] <Cork> $('.A').eq(key) if thats the reference you mean
[06:05:40] <shwaiil> Cork: yeah and .get() works fine too, i'll try .eq
[06:06:06] <Cork> shwaiil: .get won't return a jquery object
[06:06:16] <Cork> it will only be a pure dom element
[06:06:25] <AdvoWork> Cork, its 1.8.16   with all components ticked. It now runs if you get me, so it shows the dialog on the page when i click the button, but it doesnt "pop up" if you get me
[06:06:28] <shwaiil> Cork:  humm
[06:06:29] <shwaiil> ok
[06:06:34] <shwaiil> so its better to use .eq »?
[06:06:47] <Cork> if you want to use the jquery functions, ya
[06:06:50] <Cork> AdvoWork: sorry gtg
[06:06:52] <Cork> o/
[06:14:10] <edzjins> working with image loading with $.get()
[06:14:20] <edzjins> everything's fine, except IE

[06:17:44] <Umren> edzjins: except in nebraska?
[06:18:30] <edzjins> Umren: yep, could also say so. the biggest problem is that the client mainly uses ONLY internet explorer..
[06:34:38] <Flavius1924> can you tell me if this code means that when i press enter that alert must be shown ?

[06:35:37] <prodn> how can I return all divs id's that have a certain class?
[06:37:06] <prodn> Flavius1924: yes I think so, if you have focus in #id_body
[06:37:20] <Flavius1924> i hava a textarea with that id
[06:37:25] <Flavius1924> have*
[06:37:54] <Flavius1924> but it does not work :)
[06:39:56] <Flavius1924> is there some obvious mistake that i'm missing ?
[06:40:08] <prodn> Flavius1924: I don't think you should have '' around 13, it's an int
[06:40:20] <dismist> that converts it to a string, no?
[06:41:20] <prodn> yes. Where are all the guys who know? :)
[06:41:23] <Flavius1924> yeah,still nothing happening
[06:43:15] <prodn> Flavius1924: http://jsfiddle.net/E2X4H/1/
[06:43:42] <prodn> that works, I don't know what you are doing wrong though. Maybe you didn't link to jQuery lib?
[06:45:39] <Flavius1924> i see it works...but i have many jquery code that's working,it could not be the link to jQuery :)
[06:45:42] <prodn> how can I return all divs id's that have a certain class in an array?

[06:49:32] <ajpiano> $("#foo").click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $("#dialog-form").dialog("open"); });
[06:51:53] <muszek> hi... newbie question - is it "ok" to assign properties to DOM objects?  like here: var o = $('#test'); o.oldest = 'a'; o.newest = 'b';
[06:52:25] <ajpiano> muszek: that's not a dom object, it's a jquery object
[06:52:31] <crab> (a) that's not a DOM object, it's a jquery object
[06:52:35] <ajpiano> you should use .data() for that
[06:52:36] <ajpiano> ?data
[06:52:37] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:52:48] <crab> (b) you shouldn't do that, just... yeah, what he said
[06:52:52] <muszek> ajpiano: thanks what I needed, thanks
[06:54:29] <AdvoWork> Doing $("#add_product").click( function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $("#dialog-form").dialog("open");  });  works, yet doing $("#add_product").click( function(e) { e.preventDefault();alert("here");add_product();  }); doesnt even alert, any idea why that would occur?
[06:54:29] <AdvoWork> 										
[06:57:00] <Flavius1924> is there a function so that i can make a textarea blank after posting a message written in the same text area ?
[06:57:31] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: no
[06:57:34] <Flavius1924> like here,on mIRC.when i press enter the text area becomes empty,ready for another message to be written
[06:57:38] <ajpiano> a live demo helps
[06:57:46] <ajpiano> Flavius1924: $("#sometextarea").val("")
[06:59:32] <Flavius1924> thanks,that worked
[06:59:57] <Flavius1924> and i have made an event for "enter" when pressed it post all the messages
[07:00:18] <Flavius1924> but enter is also like shift+enter,sends the writing line with one line below,how can i disable that ?
[07:01:01] <ajpiano> do you want me to tell you exactly how to do it or just give you some pointers
[07:01:08] <ajpiano> so you can feel the sweet satisfaction of figuring it out yourself
[07:01:33] <dismist> thats not true for everything
[07:01:36] <dismist> such as masturbation
[07:02:28] <Flavius1924> if this is not a joke ajpiano,i'd preffer to tell me the exact function or what is needed here to finish this task
[07:03:15] <ajpiano> $("#sometextarea").keydown(functione(e) { if (e.keyCode == 13 && e.shiftKey) { e.preventDefault();  doYourStuff(); } });
[07:04:06] <AdvoWork> ajpiano, no what?
[07:04:19] <ajpiano> no, i don't have any idea why that would happen
[07:05:25] <Flavius1924> this does not change a thing or maybe i am doing it wrong
[07:05:30] <Pallet> hi all, can someone help, I think I'm being a plumb, I'm doing the following which works fine this.style.backgroundColor = '#f29400'; but I also need to add a this.style.DONT_KNOW_WHAT_GOES_HERE = 'text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #FFFFFF'
[07:06:01] <erichynds> this.style.textShadow = "1px 1px 1px #fff"
[07:06:10] <alex88> in jqueryui i'm using the autocomplete example, how can i run different actions if the user selects the element from dropdown autocomplete or types a non existant value? select element is fired when user clicks, but after that the change event too..
[07:06:31] <Flavius1924> http://dpaste.com/667762/ this is the code
[07:06:45] <Pallet> erichynds, oh cool, thanks
[07:06:51] <ajpiano> Flavius1924: e.preventDefault()
[07:06:54] <ajpiano> it's a method
[07:06:57] <ajpiano> you have to invoke it
[07:07:46] <AdvoWork> why would a normal function call fail, but the alert work, when doing: $("#add_product").click(function(e) {alert("here");add_product();});  ie the alert is now working, but not the add_product(); but, no errors in firefbug :s
[07:08:22] <ajpiano> AdvoWork: abstract questions like "Why does x work and y doesn't" rarely lead to results
[07:08:32] <ajpiano> post a live demo of your code failing and someone will more likely be able to diagnose the issue
[07:09:03] <ajpiano> no one here knows anything about your add_product() function
[07:09:18] <Flavius1924> ok,got the mistake,but this only make this available for shifht+enter
[07:09:30] <Flavius1924> i'll have a look and ask if i don't get it
[07:09:31] <Blaster> hey if I set a var myTimeout = setTimeout(); inside an ajax success callback, is there a way to clear that timeout from outside the callback function?
[07:10:03] <ajpiano> Flavius1924: isn't that what you wanted?
[07:10:10] <Flavius1924> no
[07:10:12] <ajpiano> Blaster: clearTimeout( myTimeout );
[07:10:34] <ajpiano> Flavius1924: well, you should have the tools there to make what you want to happen on shift enter happen on shift enter, and break out the part that you don't
[07:10:49] <Flavius1924> i wanted that enter can invoke the function,but after that,the textbox must be empty
[07:11:02] <Flavius1924> and i simply erased the && e.shiftKey part in the if
[07:11:02] <zeppo> anyone done any work with jquery and SVG?
[07:11:05] <Blaster> ajpiano: It's saying that myTimeout is undefined
[07:11:06] <Flavius1924> and it's ok right now
[07:11:36] <ajpiano> Blaster: you have to create the timeout in a scope where both places will have some level of access to it, in that case
[07:11:44] <Giverny> hi! which is better? $(document).keypress $(window).keypress or $('body').keypress ?
[07:11:58] <dismist> doc
[07:12:05] <Giverny> why?
[07:12:13] <dismist> thought it was a trivia question sorry
[07:12:45] <Giverny> lol
[07:14:05] <erichynds> i'm not sure events bubble up to the window object in all browsers
[07:14:07] <erichynds> go w/ document
[07:14:29] <erichynds> also, document is more semantic to what you're doing
[07:19:51] <qvarkk> Top left in window - why does the table offset.top() return higher value than it should? https://f4stest.nordic-e.com/category.html/referensnummer
[07:21:13] <ajpiano> qvarkk: why are you using the dimensions plugin
[07:21:22] <ajpiano> it hasn't been necessary since like, jquery 1.2.6
[07:21:31] <squeakytoy> in html, i have 3 <p> paragraphs after each other. How can I, on a clever way, single out one of them with jquery? if I put an "id" on the paragraph, the id will be global, which i dont want. should i use a custom attribute like <p type='errormessage'></p>? any suggestions?
[07:21:36] <qvarkk> ajpiano:  i've bought a out-of-the-box webshop solution
[07:22:03] <ajpiano> qvarkk: well, good thing you paid them money and will get support from them
[07:22:05] <ajpiano> right?!?!
[07:22:51] <qvarkk> ajpiano: they don't offer jquery support. what with your attitude? had a bad day?
[07:23:35] <ajpiano> qvarkk: do they offer any insight into why they bundle outdated plugins with versions that no longer require them?
[07:23:39] <eightfold> http://pastebin.com/Gb4KbZbQ,
[07:24:01] <qvarkk> ajpiano: maybe they do, but it has nothing to do with my question. right?
[07:24:10] <ajpiano> no, it has a lot to do with your question
[07:24:28] <qvarkk> .................................................
[07:24:40] <ajpiano> if you are overriding jquery's offset methods with the ones the dimensions plugin supplies,
[07:24:47] <ajpiano> and then getting errant results from using offset
[07:24:59] <eightfold> i want to use jquery inside a colorbox (lightbox variant). the colorbox works using http://pastebin.com/Gb4KbZbQ, but not the inline jquery code within it. from what i understand i should use an onComplete.
[07:24:59] <qvarkk> ok, that's an answer. i'll check
[07:25:00] <eightfold> but, using this: http://pastebin.com/H0EAG5U0 , the colorbox doesn't work.
[07:25:00] <eightfold> ideas?
[07:25:06] <ajpiano> that's the first thing that leaps out to me as a problem.
[07:25:08] <Flavius1924> how long r u working in jquery,aj ?
[07:25:16] <Flavius1924> *for
[07:25:17] <ajpiano> 4 years
[07:25:43] <qvarkk> ajpiano: i deactivated the dimensions plugin. now i get the same (false) result, but with decimals
[07:26:33] <ajpiano> qvarkk: where in your code is the call to offset, there's a lot of code here
[07:26:39] <antihero> I'm using jquery UI, can I set an accordion to START with a specific tab index open?
[07:27:08] <antihero> because if I use the $.accordion('activate') method it makes my bloody page jump to the accordion ?!
[07:27:08] <ajpiano> antihero: yes, the 'active' option
[07:27:13] <antihero> ajpiano: Sweet
[07:27:57] <qvarkk> http://f4stest.nordic-e.com/js/f4s.js (bottom half)
[07:29:24] <ajpiano> qvarkk: you might find that debugging using console.log is considerably more useful than writing stuff directly into the document
[07:29:48] <qvarkk> ajpiano: ok
[07:34:11] <ajpiano> qvarkk: i'm not sure that getting the offset() of an element that's display: none is particularly valid
[07:37:45] <nFFF> Guys anyway for jQuery to effect ajax loaded html?
[07:38:12] <ajpiano> there are many ways jQuery can do that, please go into more detail about your problem
[07:38:49] <biagidp> I'm using jquery's insertAfter to insert a div in to my page, then I'd like to apply the jquery ui slider to the newly created div. I've tried the following https://gist.github.com/1443241. It inserts the div, but doesn't load the slider. Can anyone provide some guidance?
[07:39:14] <ajpiano> biagidp: :o
[07:39:24] <qvarkk> ajpiano: only .scrollee is display none
[07:39:28] <qvarkk> .scrollable is viewable
[07:39:48] <biagidp> ajpiano: not sure what you mean there...
[07:39:52] <ajpiano> qvarkk: scrollee is the thing you're getting the offset of
[07:40:03] <ajpiano> biagidp: i mean, that when you use insertAfter, you shouldn't have to re-query the DOM to get the element
[07:40:39] <ajpiano> biagidp: you can either do var foo = $("<div id='whatever'>").insertAfter("#bar");  foo.slider();  or just do $("<div id='whatever'>").insertAfter("#bar").slider();
[07:40:56] <qvarkk> ajpiano:  change to scrollable
[07:41:32] <ajpiano> because insertAfter returns the collection you inserted
[07:42:27] <Blaster> anyone know if its possible to hide a div containing a gif image and then show it again without resetting the animation>?
[07:42:31] <biagidp> ajpiano: good to know! Sadly I'm still not seeing the ui element on the page. The div was/is loading fine
[07:42:52] <ajpiano> biagidp: are there any errors showing up in your console?
[07:43:03] <biagidp> ajpiano: no :-(
[07:43:13] <ajpiano> biagidp: create a live demo on jsfiddle.net please
[07:44:22] <Boardy> Problem: In this code (http://jsfiddle.net/jPAMh/) I do not get any results. If I view the URL in a browser I get the JSON result as expected. What is going wrong?
[07:45:59] <ajpiano> Boardy: is the service returning JSON or JSONP
[07:46:19] <Boardy> ajpiano: JSON
[07:46:26] <ajpiano> that's not going to do you a lot of good :/
[07:46:40] <ajpiano> you can only fetch JSONP when you're doing a cross-domain request
[07:48:02] <Boardy> But the doeJeDing() function also does not work and that is the way I would like to get my data.
[07:48:28] <biagidp> ajpiano: here's the jsfiddle- http://jsfiddle.net/AeHPs/
[07:49:38] <ajpiano> Boardy: if you're making a request to a resource on another domain, it simply will not work
[07:49:44] <ajpiano> unless you can use JSONP
[07:49:54] <Boardy> Ok... thx. I will investigate further.
[07:50:02] <ajpiano> and that's what doeJeDing is doing.
[07:50:06] <FleetFox> Hello! Is something like $('.document_id, .contact_id').change(function(){} valid?
[07:50:58] <mathi> hey!
[07:51:00] <ajpiano> FleetFox: yes.
[07:51:02] <SargoDarya_> afaik it is FleetFox
[07:51:23] <nFFF> Guys anyway for jQuery to effect ajax loaded html? http://www.safeguardarmor.com/store/bullet-and-stab-proof-vests.html click page no 2, and then the 'colors' dissapear
[07:52:24] <ajpiano> biagidp: including the jQuery UI CSS helps :) http://jsfiddle.net/AeHPs/2/
[07:52:35] <mathi> hey
[07:53:01] <biagidp> ajpiano: bwahahahaha, yeah it does. Thanks man :-D
[07:53:07] <mathi> how can I get the class that starts with "hour" ? (the problem is that the elements have many classes, but I want to return only that class that starts with "hour")
[07:53:47] <ajpiano> mathi: get the string of classes, split it on spaces, filter the array by a regex
[07:54:07] <nFFF> ajpiano any ideas why the jQuery isn't working with AJAX
[07:54:16] <ajpiano> nFFF: if the 'colors' is created by javascript, you have to run the code that creates it after the data has been fetched and inserted
[07:54:16] <nFFF> its not being applied to the new loaded html
[07:54:21] <ajpiano> using the ajax callback
[07:54:26] <nFFF> how to do that?
[07:54:31] <ajpiano> ?faq events @ nFFF
[07:54:31] <bot-t> nFFF, FAQ: Why do my events stop working after an AJAX request? - http://tr.im/jqfaq2_1
[07:54:42] <nFFF> thanks
[07:54:50] <nFFF> that sites dead
[07:55:05] <nFFF> foudn it on google though
[07:55:07] <nFFF> thanks
[07:55:15] <mathi> ajpiano, any other easier way ?
[07:55:46] <ajpiano> mathi: what exactly are you hoping for?
[07:56:29] <FleetFox> Hmm does setting value with .val() trigger changed event?
[07:56:41] <ajpiano> nFFF: you just need to use the ajax calback to call the function that creates the color stuff - i don't know enough else about your code to tell you exactly how to do that in your codebase
[07:56:42] <ajpiano> FleetFox: no
[07:56:58] <nFFF> Yea simple solution I think
[07:57:18] <FleetFox> ajpiano: how do i change it so it triggers?
[07:57:23] <mathi> ajpiano, somehow several elements must be marked as "hour06", "hour07", ... and I need to treat the first element "hour06", the first "hour07", etc. so for the moment I added classes hour06, hour07, ... and then I have an array, put "hour06" in array once treated, and when I process the next element, I check if hour06 is already in array or not
[07:57:36] <ajpiano> FleetFox: you can call .trigger("change") after it
[07:58:05] <FleetFox> k, thanks
[07:59:01] <ajpiano> qvarkk: the code appears to add the class appropriately in the right case now, there's just no styling applied to table.scrollee.active
[07:59:13] <nFFF> ajpiano, this is legal: jQuery("#catalogfilter_list").replaceWith(data.products).('.product-name:contains("Commander")') ?
[07:59:18] <ajpiano> nope
[07:59:19] <nFFF> can you use a selector like this
[07:59:25] <dcarper> when I #stop a #slideUp, the following #slideDown fails, any ideas?
[07:59:27] <ajpiano> what are you trying to do
[07:59:31] <qvarkk> ajpiano: weird thing is that the top-position changes
[07:59:36] <qvarkk> if you update
[08:00:10] <nFFF> ajpiano, basically loading a new product list via getjson(), and want to decorate this new list of products, by adding colors to certain products
[08:00:20] <ajpiano> nFFF: you can use see ?find
[08:00:21] <bot-t> nFFF, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[08:00:22] <nFFF> It works currently when the first list is loaded when the page loads
[08:00:55] <nFFF> Let me load apastebin as this is a bit complex
[08:00:56] <ajpiano> qvarkk: the "top-position" of what is changing?
[08:03:06] <arbokrad> quick question on the jQuery.ajax() method.... is there a way for me to retrieve HTML using the "html" dataType but prevent scripts from executing in that HTML?
[08:05:10] <nFFF> ajpiano, I need to search a JSON object and make a case, where if the class product-name contains a certain string, add some html
[08:05:16] <nFFF> any advice
[08:05:24] <ajpiano> huh
[08:05:40] <ajpiano> oh
[08:05:46] <nFFF> AJAX request is getJSON
[08:06:00] <ajpiano> so the object has a property called 'product-name' ?
[08:06:03] <nFFF> Which is fine, but jsonobject.products, contains the product list
[08:06:13] <ajpiano> the product list is a string or an array?
[08:06:40] <nFFF> And in this product list is a bunch of elements (string of html), and some of those elements are <div class="product-name">
[08:07:01] <nFFF> Need to test each product name, and add html depending on what it contains
[08:07:30] <ajpiano> after you insert it, just do a $(".product-name").each(function() { /* and do stuff here */   });  ?
[08:07:47] <ajpiano> you can look at the html/text/attributes/properties of the element at that point?
[08:09:01] <Boardy> ajpiano: Thanks a lot. I would not have been able to solve it without your tip about using JSONP.
[08:09:16] <^zoggy^> so is this really a jquery bug: http://jsfiddle.net/dDJCS/
[08:09:26] <ajpiano> np Boardy, you know what they say about me...
[08:09:29] <^zoggy^> click on 2222, notice that it fires off 2222 then 1111
[08:09:30] <ajpiano> "always happy to give just the tip"
[08:09:39] <arbokrad> hiyooo
[08:10:00] <chee> hiyoo
[08:10:14] <Aristata> Can anyone point me to a resource on how I can make my own custom function: $('input').myFunction() so that if I call it on some input it makes that input behave a certain way? I don't know what this is called at all.
[08:11:43] <arbokrad> not trying to spam, just looking for help: is there a way for me to retrieve HTML with jQuery.ajax() (using the "html" dataType) and prevent scripts from executing in that HTML?
[08:11:47] <ajpiano> ^zoggy^: i'm pretty sure it's not valid to have two inputs inside of one label
[08:11:52] <ajpiano> if you remove the label wrapper, it works fine
[08:12:08] <ajpiano> Aristata: it's a "jquery plugin"
[08:12:16] <Aristata> Oh yeah?
[08:12:17] <Aristata> Cool
[08:12:17] <ajpiano> docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[08:12:18] <Aristata> On it
[08:13:36] <Aristata> ajpiano:  I have just been taken to a whole new level in my javascript capabilities ;) Thanks mate
[08:13:37] <andrew9183> make sure you use a closure!
[08:14:04] <nFFF> ajpiano, http://pastebin.com/NiRiHdCE
[08:15:01] <^zoggy^> ajpiano, w3c says its okay..
[08:15:06] <ajpiano> nFFF: you just have to run the code that does all this formatting after the content has been inserted
[08:15:41] <andrew9183> howd you get so good ajpiano
[08:15:55] <ajpiano> i helped people in here
[08:16:05] <ajpiano> so that i would be exposed to a lot of random problems and figure out how to solve them
[08:16:17] <WebDragon> eats sleeps breathes and lurks jqury
[08:16:23] <WebDragon> jquery*
[08:16:34] <ajpiano> nFFF: unfortunately i'm about to get re-routed into... doing real work
[08:16:40] <ajpiano> so i don't know if i can help much more
[08:16:47] <ajpiano> ^zoggy^: if so, then file a bug :)
[08:16:51] <^zoggy^> ajpiano, just did
[08:17:03] <ajpiano> ^zoggy^: i just think it's really weird that when you click one button, both show being clicked
[08:17:18] <ajpiano> but yeah
[08:17:24] <^zoggy^> yes, i do agree.. notice that jquery 1.6.4 has the problem as well
[08:17:27] <^zoggy^> so its not something new...
[08:17:39] <rahmen> Hi! If I make a jsonp call with ajax and the page return something other than json - will my script stop working afterwards?
[08:18:02] <^zoggy^> no
[08:18:04] <rahmen> or will it call the error callback function?
[08:18:16] <ajpiano> ^zoggy^: um
[08:18:24] <ajpiano> The label element may contain at most one descendant input element, button element, select element, or textarea element.
[08:18:35] <ajpiano> http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/label.html
[08:18:47] <Aristata> Ok guys, now that I know how to make my own plugin, I am wondering if this is possible: I would like to make a plugin that detects when a single character is entered into an input field, and if it has been entered, automatically switch to the next input in the dom. I am doing this because I have a particular site that has an "age gate" in the front, where each digit in the birthday is it's own input. This works fine on all browse
[08:19:16] <^zoggy^> ajpiano, then why does their validator not catch it ?
[08:19:29] <^zoggy^> im not using html5.. using xhtml 1.0 tra
[08:20:01] <risky_s> hi is there a way of using the jquery validation plugin without the submit handler
[08:20:03] <rahmen> ^zoggy^: was that "no" directed to me?
[08:20:11] <risky_s> i mean executing code without a submit
[08:21:00] <ajpiano> ^zoggy^: same thing in xhtml http://www.w3.org/TR/html/dtds.html
[08:21:01] <ajpiano> etc
[08:21:12] <^zoggy^> hmm guess their validator just didnt catch it :/
[08:21:14] <^zoggy^> thanks
[08:21:19] <ajpiano> ^zoggy^: i don't know why their validator didn't catch it, i didn't write that :)
[08:21:59] <Ch4rAzZz> )/quit
[08:22:02] <ShawnRisk> how do I centre images (landscape and portrait) within a div?
[08:23:34] <risky_s> you can set the image as a background and center it that way
[08:23:37] <risky_s> or use margins then
[08:25:23] <ShawnRisk> here is the url: http://www.beasofbloomsbury.com/ and the images are on the right side of the text.
[08:27:32] <PaperBoy> lets say i have a div that contains like 5 lines of text ..  i size it so it shows only one line of text.. and then on click i use jquery to make the div grow to display the rest of the lines of text..    Now my problem is  when the div is in the state of one line..   i can still partially see the second line of text so its not really hidden.   If i change the line-height property then when
[08:27:32] <PaperBoy> the div expands.. the whole text will have that line-height property....
[08:28:40] <Tomashe> hey guys something weird is going on on IE i created a script that wrap all the iamges with link so i could open it with colorbox, but on IE it isnt working
[08:28:46] <Tomashe> anyone here to have a quicklook ?
[08:28:55] <Tomashe> http://www.arnir.dreamax.co.il/Cetifications
[08:29:13] <Tomashe> check on IE and FIREFOX , see in FF its working perfectly
[08:29:20] <Tomashe> what is wrong?
[08:29:27] <codercube> link is not working
[08:29:43] <Tomashe> what is show you?
[08:29:47] <Tomashe> it*
[08:30:04] <Tomashe> http://www.arnir.dreamax.co.il/Cetifications < try that
[08:30:08] <Tomashe> without the www.
[08:30:55] <ShawnRisk> did anyone see my question?
[08:31:07] <codercube> Tomashe: can't open your link
[08:32:00] <Tomashe> hmm
[08:32:30] <Tomashe> damn its not working from some reason
[08:33:56] <qvarkk> ajpiano: now, when i insert a datepicker.js (works on other pages) it works. f******ng strange
[08:34:07] <rahmen> Hi! I am parsing some addresses with ajax. I use jsonp because I know some of my addresses will return json data. However some might not establish connection at all and some might return non json data. This code: http://pastebin.com/qb5KqQEk should imo change the status of all objects to either "Success", "Fail" or "No address".  However when running the script I get a few "Success", a few...
[08:34:08] <rahmen> ..."Fail" and some "Getting...". Firebug's last line in the console is "syntax error" and it's one of the addresses that start with "<!DOCTYPE..." it's not json so ofc it's syntax error but why doesn't the script finish all addresses?
[08:35:52] <^zoggy^> ok bug submitted to w3c
[08:36:32] <nFFF> How do I apply jQuery to a json object?
[08:37:22] <thirdender> what's the easiest way to auto-calculate the minimum width of a BODY in an IFRAME? (you know, for those lightbox IFRAME situations)
[08:38:23] <codercube> thirdender: what do you mean by "minimum width"?
[08:39:13] <thirdender> when the IFRAME loads, I want to calculate the width and height of the BODY in the IFRAME... this will by default be the width of the IFRAME, which isn't what I want... I want to figure out what the smallest width the BODY element could take is so that the IFRAME can be resized to that width
[08:39:24] <codercube> nFFF: if you get HTML from json, you can simply wrap HTML code with $()
[08:40:02] <qvarkk> why does it return wrong offset.top? https://f4stest.nordic-e.com/category.html/referensnummer  (in firebug console)
[08:40:25] <codercube> thirdender: you can get iframe elements like $("#iframeId").contents()
[08:40:31] <rahmen> ShawnRisk: I think you can do it with css only: Set vertical-align: middle; on the images and set line-height: 520px; on their closest container
[08:41:32] <thirdender> codercube: yeah, but what if two elements should be next to each other instead of above each other...
[08:42:17] <thirdender> codercube: I'm looking for a catch-all :-p right now I'm thinking of floating the BODY left until the calculation is done, then removing the float, but I was wondering if someone has a better idea
[08:42:23] <JmZ> hmm
[08:43:09] <JmZ> in my code im doing something along the lines of: $('some selector').eq(0).text(), its returning the text within the element *and* the content of a HTML comment also in the element
[08:43:11] <ShawnRisk> rahmen: that is not working or maybe I am using these in the inspector on the wrong divs.  Can you tell me in more detail where to set these?
[08:43:15] <antdillon> codercube, you can only get a load event triggered from an iframe. You cant get the current address its on
[08:43:23] <JmZ> but when i try it on my own system on some other page, i don't get the comment text
[08:44:08] <JmZ> actually the same page but in chrome's console rather than by running my code
[08:44:45] <SoulRaven>  anyone know how to resolve the problem with ajax, iframe and http_referrer ?
[08:46:57] <thirdender> JmZ: lol, weird. I thought the only way to get the comment nodes was with $("...").contents(), but .text() is getting the comments for you?
[08:47:04] <tazrover> I'm new to JavaScript & jQuery:  trying to access an appended element in a separate jquery function, but $('. + class) does not seem to work.  Is there something I'm missing with how .append() works?
[08:47:31] <JmZ> thirdender: me too, but im using .text() in my code and it is getting the comment contents somehow
[08:48:20] <JmZ> thirdender: difference is, my code is running under node (nodejs), but the jquery lib is the same
[08:48:22] <thirdender> tazrover: no, you're not missing anything about .append(), but check the rest of your code... is the class is being added properly?
[08:48:41] <thirdender> JmZ: wait, you're using jQuery under nodejs?
[08:48:58] <nezZario> jquery is really sucking right now
[08:49:05] <JmZ> thirdender: parsing external URLs (XML & HTML, jquery for the HTML)
[08:49:10] <nezZario> i guess i might have to move to mootools ..
[08:49:17] <nezZario> does anyone have a jquery equiv to this: http://greengeckodesign.com/projects/MenuMatic/examples/vertical/index.htm?q=projects/menumatic/examples/vertical/ ?
[08:49:51] <JmZ> thirdender: seems hacky, but the guy who wrote the module pulled it off, and it is pretty useful for what im doing
[08:50:36] <phlp> nezZario: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/menu.html
[08:51:03] <Tomashe> there is a way to test live script on IE like with firebug?
[08:51:04] <thirdender> JmZ: it could be Node.js returns the textContent of a node improperly? try doing this :-p (based off your original code) $('some selector').eq(0).map(function() { return this.textContent; }) and see what Node.js returns
[08:51:17] <JmZ> sure
[08:51:46] <tazrover> thirdender:  The appended element shows when I load my html, however the function trying to access that element doesn't work unless I type the element directly into the html file (if that makes sense)
[08:51:48] <thirdender> Tomashe: IE8+ has a developer console built in, and there's DebugBar for lower versions... both stink though after you've been spoiled by Firebug and Chrome's console
[08:51:50] <nezZario> phlp is there a tutorial that goes with that?
[08:52:01] <nezZario> i guess i can figure it out with what you gave but tutorials are always nice
[08:52:35] <phlp> nezZario: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[08:52:35] <andrew9183> what do you guys think of extJS ?
[08:52:41] <Tomashe> yes teh dev tools are shit
[08:52:48] <Tomashe> i dont see things live
[08:53:01] <Tomashe> i created a code that wrap image with alink but i cannt see it on devtools on iE
[08:53:08] <thirdender> tazrover: are you running your code inside a $(function() { ... }) block? can you post a link to your code?
[08:53:33] <thirdender> tazrover: or a http://jsfiddle.net/ link
[08:53:54] <JmZ> thirdender: yeah it does contain the comment contents
[08:54:07] <JmZ> thirdender: i just console.log()'d it in the map() callback
[08:54:19] <thirdender> JmZ: it shows in both places? in the console too?
[08:54:55] <thirdender> tazrover: errr... http://pastebin.com/ :-p
[08:55:05] <JmZ> thirdender: .text() and outputting textContent in the map callback, both are identical strings
[08:55:08] <JmZ> containing the comments
[08:55:24] <Tomashe> $(".CBCOLORBOX img").each(function(){		var img=$(this).attr("src"); 		$(this).wrap('<a href="'+img+'">');	}); < this isnt working on IE
[08:55:43] <Tomashe> any idea why
[08:56:42] <thirdender> JmZ: but that's just under Node.js right? I'm assuming .text() is using .textContent to get the text, but what about the console output? is the console output right in both cases, and the Node.js output wrong in both cases?
[08:56:48] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me
[08:57:24] <tazrover> thirdender:  yes, inside a $(function() {...}) block.  i'll try a pastebin link.  one min..
[08:57:26] <codercube> ShawnRisk: what was the question?
[08:57:51] <JmZ> thirdender: if i try the same in chrome's console, console.log(this.textContent) produces an empty list O_o
[08:57:52] <JmZ> somehow
[08:57:55] <ShawnRisk> how do I centre images (landscape and portrait) within a div?  here is the url: http://www.beasofbloomsbury.com/ and the images are on the right side of the text.
[08:57:56] <rahmen> ShawnRisk: I just used Firebug. So I have not tested on any other browser than Firefox. If you can't do it with css you'll have to adjust the position with jquery. This link should help: http://web.enavu.com/daily-tip/verticaly-center-an-image-inside-a-div/
[08:58:31] <JmZ> thirdender: one sec it'll be a typo
[08:59:21] <JmZ> thirdender: yeah, node includes comment contents, chrome doesn't
[09:01:03] <codercube> ShawnRisk: well, aren't your images centered in a div now?
[09:01:46] <ShawnRisk> codercube: nope.  I have landscape and portrait pictures
[09:02:16] <thirdender> JmZ: yeah, that has to be it... umm... I think the simplest solution is probably... $("selector").eq(0).contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType !== 8; }).text()
[09:02:21] <Poliaster> i did catch it
[09:03:08] <JmZ> thirdender: do you think that'd be much of a performance hit? this thing is going to be parsing a lot of documents so just wondered
[09:03:12] <Tomashe> i didnt see last posts
[09:03:40] <thirdender> JmZ: I don't think, but...
[09:06:19] <thirdender> JmZ: since node.js is returning the comments text, this is really the only way I can think to intentionally skip those comments... it could possibly be optimized slightly, but no matter what you do you're going to be removing those comment nodes from the jQuery object or only getting textContent from non-comment nodes
[09:07:07] <JmZ> thirdender: yeah it should be fine, that seems to do the job anyway
[09:07:17] <thirdender> JmZ: cool :-p
[09:08:30] <tazrover> thirdender:  Hope this link works - http://pastebin.com/x0nMJa4T
[09:08:41] <Aristata> Ok guys, now that I know how to make my own plugin, I am wondering if this is possible: I would like to make a plugin that detects when a single character is entered into an input field, and if it has been entered, automatically switch to the next input in the dom. I am doing this because I have a particular site that has an "age gate" in the front, where each digit in the birthday is it's own input. This works fine on all browse
[09:10:48] <thirdender> Aristata: yeah, totally possible :-p give me a few minutes I can send something
[09:11:09] <Umren> thirdender: he want do it himself ;d
[09:11:10] <mathi> if(jQuery.inArray(clazz, arrayHours)) { console.log(arrayHours[clazz]); }    // prints undefined
[09:11:23] <mathi> arrayHours is empty, why does inArray returns true ???
[09:12:02] <erichynds> mathi: inArray returns the index of the elem, of -1 if it's not there, which happens to be truthy
[09:12:07] <erichynds> so test if $.inArray() > -1
[09:13:01] <tazrover> thirdender: the .draggable function works if I manually stick my "tweet-container" class into my html document, but doesn't seem to work if I append it...
[09:14:26] <arbokrad> is there a way for me to retrieve HTML with jQuery.ajax() (using the "html" dataType) and prevent scripts from executing in that HTML?
[09:14:54] <thirdender> tazrover: It's likely that the .draggable(...) code is running *before* the $.getJSON(...) code finishes... waiting for the server to respond probably takes a few milliseconds. Try moving the .draggable(...) code inside the .getJson(..., function() { ... }) callback block
[09:15:11] <thirdender> tazrover: at the end somewhere, probably right before the "return;"
[09:15:30] <mathi> thank you :)
[09:15:48] <erichynds> arbokrad: remove the script tags with a regex. similar to how $.fn.load works: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L214
[09:16:54] <ilriso> Hi
[09:17:06] <arbokrad> thanks erichynds, ill give that a shot
[09:17:17] <ilriso> why does the z-index of the element animated to the left change and gets on top of the menu? http://jsfiddle.net/XJ7ec/
[09:18:47] <solars> hey, whats the easiest way to check if $(this) e.g. a td, is empty? (has no content)
[09:22:31] <codercube> solars: $(this).contents().length == 0
[09:24:10] <juha_> or $(this).length == 0
[09:24:23] <juha_> oh wait, no
[09:24:32] <ShawnRisk> no solution to my problem :(
[09:25:00] <justin_> Hi there. Can someone help me running the all the jQuery tests available here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/test
[09:25:13] <justin_> Do I need a running PHP server?
[09:25:13] <solars> codercube, thanks!
[09:25:43] <codercube> bye all, may the force be with you
[09:25:59] <tazrover> thirdender:  Awesome!  It works!  Thank you my friend, I would never have figured that out.  I need to study how JS code executes.  Is the issue I had a result of JS being asynchronous?
[09:28:14] <JmZ> ShawnRisk: text-align:center the div, there's your horizontal done. vertical you'd wanna move the image down this many pixels: (containerHeight-imageHeight)/2
[09:28:18] <JmZ> or something like that
[09:29:32] <ShawnRisk> JmZ: yes but how?  I have tried two different ways but nothing is working.  Are you saying text-align on the images or div?
[09:29:42] <thirdender> tazrover: something like that :-p think of it more like being event-driven... until the getJSON event was finish and called it's callback, there wasn't any content for the draggable code to act upon.
[09:29:57] <ShawnRisk> JmZ: did you look at the site?
[09:29:58] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: #css, really
[09:30:42] <JmZ> woo a fellow ##php'er
[09:30:44] <JmZ> lol
[09:30:53] <justin_> What should I do to run the jQuery unit tests?
[09:31:27] <JmZ> ShawnRisk: like i said, "text-align:center THE DIV"
[09:31:34] <tazrover> thirdender:  Ok, I think that makes sense.  Thanks again!
[09:31:46] <ajpiano> justin_: open them in a web browser?
[09:32:18] <thirdender> tazrover: np :-p
[09:32:20] <justin_> ajpiano: I somehow want a more automated thing, there are so many tests! I don't want to do it manually
[09:32:43] <justin_> ajpiano: And what are all the .php files doing there?
[09:32:45] <ajpiano> the unit test suite typically runs in a browser, it runs them all
[09:32:48] <ShawnRisk> okay I will go over there
[09:32:55] <ajpiano> justin_: there are some files that exist for testing ajax stuff
[09:32:59] <ajpiano> iirc.
[09:33:06] <solars> how can I prevent an item to be dropped on a droppable and send it back? e.g. if the target is 'full'
[09:33:29] <ajpiano> justin_: if you have questions about the test suite, #jquery-dev tends to be a better spot to ask
[09:34:08] <justin_> ajpiano: Ok, thanks. By "test suite" do you mean the set of files in here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/test ?
[09:34:51] <ajpiano> justin_: yes - are you familar with QUnit
[09:35:11] <ajpiano> justin_: do you have jQuery cloned locally?
[09:35:51] <justin_> ajpiano: I'm just starting with QUnit, and I have jQuery cloned locally
[09:36:14] <ajpiano> justin_: so if you open up a browser and go to index.html in it
[09:36:18] <ajpiano> that will run the test suite
[09:36:19] <justin_> At the moment I'm opening each .html file individually
[09:36:27] <GeO2> hey guys
[09:36:43] <justin_> ajpiano: I see. I'll test that, thanks
[09:37:14] <GeO2> I have an element I want to trigger mouseover on, so I use ele.trigger('mouseover');
[09:37:26] <GeO2> it works well, but if I was already hovering another element it takes it off
[09:37:38] <GeO2> I mean I can't virtually hover 2 elements at the same time and I'd like to do it
[09:38:16] <GeO2> one being by the user, and the other by a script (to simulate a highlight, I toggle it off and on several times)
[09:40:17] <lugzer> hi
[09:41:06] <lugzer> what's wrong with $("#preview_wrap div footer").html("<p>test</p>");  ? the structure is as shown.. do i have to use children() all the time? thought this is faster
[09:41:40] <thirdender> GeO2: if you store the mouseover handler function in a variable (var mouseoverHandler = function() { ... }; $("...").mousover(mouseoverHandler);) then you can call the mouseoverHandler without using .trigger(). You should be able to do mouseoverHandler.apply(myElement)
[09:41:57] <justin_> ajpiano: When I open index.html I just get "jQuery Test Suite (minified)". No sign of tests being run.
[09:42:06] <GeO2> lugzer try preview_wrap > div > footer
[09:43:02] <MiguelV> Hello all, I have a UI dialog box firing but disappearing almost instantly upon page only in IE. Any clues?
[09:43:23] <lugzer> GeO2, tried that. and ("#preview_wrap").find("footer").html(...) no luck. works only if i add id to <footer>...
[09:43:43] <GeO2> can I see the page lugzer ?
[09:44:47] <lugzer> GeO2, http://jsfiddle.net/5uq6U/1/ -- can't show you implementation. internal ;)
[09:46:34] <rohit00082002> hello @cork and all
[09:47:11] <GeO2> #preview_wrap > div > footer  should work :/
[09:47:31] <GeO2> if you have firebug just type in the console $("#preview_wrap") to see if it does return the element
[09:47:38] <GeO2> and then add them one by one
[09:47:41] <ajpiano> justin_: you don't see like, lots and lots of things that either are light blue or red?
[09:47:43] <rohit00082002> In afternoon ( India) you said about not using inline onclick event in a tag
[09:48:03] <justin_> ajpiano: No.
[09:48:13] <ajpiano> justin_: any errors in the console?
[09:48:14] <lugzer> GeO2, thanks lemme try
[09:48:22] <rohit00082002> but then I wonder how to do this without jquery, in pure javascript ?
[09:48:43] <Websteria> I'm writing an JQuery UI widget which needs to do a number of asynchronus calls, but I need to make sure they are all finished before I return control to the user. How do I keep track of the calls, and if they are done, and if they are not how do I wait for them to be?
[09:48:52] <ajpiano> Websteria: are you familiar with Deferreds
[09:48:57] <Websteria> That's what I'm using
[09:49:14] <ajpiano> $.when( $.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax() ).then(fn)
[09:49:18] <Websteria> Right
[09:49:21] <ajpiano> and you obviously don't have to call the ajax in there
[09:49:25] <ajpiano> you can use a refereence to that
[09:49:38] <Websteria> so I should keep references to all of my $when's and check to see if they are done?
[09:49:44] <justin_> ajpiano: Yes, lots of errors. "Sizzle is not defined", "QUnit is not defined", "Module is not defined", etc. etc.
[09:49:52] <ajpiano> justin_: ohhhhh
[09:50:01] <ajpiano> justin_: sounds like you need to init the submodules in your repo
[09:50:07] <ralphholzmann> is these a bug - http://jsfiddle.net/DtpsB/ ?
[09:50:11] <justin_> aha
[09:50:17] <justin_> ajpiano: How can I do that?
[09:50:31] <Websteria> ajpiano: Does that mean I need to keep a reference to all of the $when()'s I call and then check the status when I need to make sure they are done?
[09:50:51] <ajpiano> Websteria: no
[09:50:52] <ajpiano> not at all
[09:50:55] <Websteria> ok
[09:50:59] <ajpiano> it means that you keep track of the ajax calls
[09:50:59] <Websteria> let me explain a little further
[09:51:01] <ajpiano> and pass them to when
[09:51:18] <GeO2> thirdender : I can't get it to work :/
[09:51:18] <Websteria> so I should queue the calls and make one When call?
[09:51:19] <ajpiano> and it magically fires the .then when they all complete
[09:51:24] <ajpiano> because that's how they work
[09:51:42] <ajpiano> Websteria: you wouldn't queue them, you'd just return references to them
[09:51:48] <GeO2> I need to pass a variable to the event handler, don't know how to do it this way
[09:52:00] <ajpiano> justin_: git submodule init && git submodule update
[09:52:19] <Websteria> ajpiano: let's say I have this
[09:52:20] <justin_> ajpiano: Thanks!
[09:52:20] <Websteria>  $.when($.tmpload('portlet'), module)
[09:52:21] <Websteria>                 .then(function (template, data) {
[09:52:21] <Websteria>                     var newModuleObject = $.tmpl(template, data);
[09:52:21] <Websteria>                     newModuleObject.appendTo("#" + columnID);
[09:52:21] <Websteria>                     var newPortletSelector = "DIV #" + module.ID;
[09:52:21] <Websteria>                     self._skinPortletItems(newPortletSelector);
[09:52:21] <Websteria>                     var moduleObject = self._CreateSingleModule(self, $(newPortletSelector));
[09:52:22] <Websteria>                     self._LinkModule(self, moduleObject);
[09:52:22] <Websteria>                 });
[09:52:27] <ajpiano> Websteria: don't do that
[09:52:34] <ajpiano> one does not paste large blocks of code into irc channels
[09:52:39] <Websteria> sorry
[09:52:43] <Websteria> my bad
[09:52:57] <Websteria> where should I paste?
[09:52:57] <thirdender> GeO2: mouseHandler.call(mouseoverElement, arg1, arg2) :-) see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[09:53:02] <ajpiano> use a pastebin
[09:53:03] <Aristata> WebDragon:  pastie.org
[09:53:08] <Aristata> or pastebin
[09:53:15] <Aristata> or jfiddle
[09:53:17] <ajpiano> ideally, you'd create a live demo on jsfiddle.net
[09:53:34] <thirdender> GeO2: the first argument becomes the "this" variable for the function, so make sure it's the element you want to simulate the mouseover for
[09:53:35] <Websteria> It's difficult to create a livedemo as it's so big
[09:53:41] <Websteria> here we go: http://pastebin.com/jkpn00NX
[09:53:45] <GeO2> ok gonna try
[09:53:58] <Websteria> I have a number of those that I need to run, and I need to know when they're all done, but they won't all be queued at the same time.
[09:54:12] <Websteria> because other things in the plugin rely on them being completed.
[09:54:16] <MiguelV> Hello all, I have a UI dialog box firing but disappearing almost instantly upon page only in IE. Any clues?
[09:54:18] <ajpiano> Websteria: does $.tmpload actually return an observable (an instance of jqXHR)
[09:54:33] <Websteria> I believe it returns a promise. It's a plugin I'm using
[09:54:36] <ajpiano> ok
[09:54:51] <ajpiano> you simply need to collect all your requests somehwere... inside of an object, whatever works for your app
[09:54:59] <ajpiano> or an array, or whatever
[09:55:08] <ajpiano> and then you just call when, passing it all those things
[09:55:19] <Websteria> ok
[09:55:20] <ajpiano> and then you get a callback when they complete
[09:55:33] <Tomashe> aj wassup mate
[09:55:40] <Tomashe> $(".CBCOLORBOX img").each(function(){		var img=$(this).attr("src"); 		$(this).wrap('<a href="'+img+'">');	}); < this isnt working on IE
[09:55:44] <Tomashe> can u help me with that mate?
[09:55:47] <ajpiano> Websteria: here's an example of using an array with an arbitrary number of promises http://jsfiddle.net/hGgcU/
[09:55:51] <Websteria> k
[09:56:20] <ajpiano> Websteria: and if you haven't seen http://lanyrd.com/2011/jquery-sf-bay-area/sdptk/, you should probably take a look
[09:56:50] <ajpiano> Tomashe: not right now sorry
[09:56:59] <Websteria> so if the $when returns a promise I can create a deferred object and call them all through that.
[09:57:08] <Websteria> I thought the $when ran whenever it felt like it :-)
[09:57:55] <ajpiano> Websteria: $.when doesn't return a promise, it observes promises
[09:58:04] <ajpiano> Websteria: you can create new Deferrerds on your own, however
[09:58:07] <ajpiano> and pass those to $.when
[09:58:25] <Websteria> ok, I think I'm going to watch the screencast you sent. I think I'm looking at these differently than they are in some way.
[09:58:36] <ajpiano> yeah, i agree with both of those things ;)
[09:58:46] <Websteria> I understand the $when does that and when it's done it calls then .then with the results
[09:58:54] <Websteria> what I don't understand is when the $when actually runs
[09:59:17] <ajpiano> it runs when either all the calls have completed successfully, or when the first one has failed
[09:59:20] <Websteria> I'm getting that I need to put all my $when calls into one big deferred.
[09:59:33] <sunscreen> when you animate a element away from another relative element the elements left behind will take up the space automatically right?
[09:59:40] <ajpiano> Websteria: you have it backwards
[09:59:47] <ajpiano> you need to putall your DEFERREDS into one big $.WHEN
[09:59:54] <Websteria> ah
[10:00:02] <Websteria> but it doesn't run simultaneously with the executing code. I've seen it wait until all other code is done to run the $.when statements.
[10:00:09] <ajpiano> right
[10:00:14] <ajpiano> it's for normalising async stuff
[10:00:22] <ajpiano> Websteria: you should probably really watch that screencast, and also read:
[10:00:24] <Websteria> ok
[10:00:29] <ajpiano> ?g erichynds deferreds in jquery
[10:00:30] <bot-t> ajpiano, Using Deferreds in jQuery 1.5 | Eric Hynds - http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[10:00:33] <Websteria> I'm definitely going to watch the screencasts.
[10:00:44] <Websteria> I've read that, I'm going to watch the screencast now.
[10:00:57] <Websteria> Thank you guys! Ajpiano, thanks for not getting too frustrated with me. :-)
[10:01:07] <ajpiano> :)
[10:02:01] <sunscreen> when you animate a element away from another relative element the elements left behind will take up the space automatically right? .. eg: three relative divs slamed in a row... then you animate the top one out of view do the bottom two automatically move up
[10:02:20] <MiguelV> Why does UI dialog box disappear in IE when iframe content starts to load?
[10:08:48] <GeO2> can I detect if an event has been triggered by a user or by triggerHandler() ? (in another script which is interfering)
[10:10:29] <ilriso> why does fadeIn and fadeOut won't work on elements with absolute position?
[10:16:16] <qvarkk> why doesn't the javascript work in Safari 3.1? https://f4stest.nordic-e.com/category.html/referensnummer
[10:16:26] <qvarkk> the top div should be updated with numbers when you scroll
[10:19:44] <thirdender> GeO2: in your handler, get the jQuery event object ( .mouseover(function(e) { ... }) )
[10:20:19] <thirdender> GeO2: e.originalEvent will be set if the user mouseover triggers the event... it will not be set if triggered manually by .trigger("mouseover")
[10:25:00] <bonhoffer> if i have an array, say: [1,2,3] and i want <table><tr><td>1</td>... can i get that?
[10:27:05] <shesek_> bonhoffer, $('<tr>').append($.map([1,2,3], function(v) { return $('<td>').text(v)[0]; }))
[10:27:49] <shesek_> notice the `[0]` - append() doesn't work with an array of jQuery objects
[10:28:05] <Haprog> shesek_: bonhoffer didn't specify whether he wanted one array item per row or column though.
[10:28:30] <shesek_> Haprog, by the way he wrote it, I assume per column
[10:28:39] <shesek_> if it ended with </td></tr>... I'd assume per row
[10:28:42] <bonhoffer> thanks!
[10:28:49] <bonhoffer> works well
[10:29:06] <shesek_> you welcome
[10:29:37] <qvarkk> why does https://f4stest.nordic-e.com/   - show the wrong offsetTop()? It's being displayed in the top blue div when you scroll
[10:30:49] <bonhoffer> what is an alernative to using alert(foo); for debugging. console.log ?
[10:32:17] <qvarkk> bonhoffer:  if you have firebug installed, yes
[10:32:23] <martndemus> console.log for sure
[10:32:29] <bonhoffer> chrome
[10:32:37] <martndemus> it works in opera, chrome and safari too
[10:32:45] <martndemus> even IE9!
[10:32:55] <thirdender> bonhoffer: chrome works too... if you want to make sure the code won't error in < IE8, do "window.console && console.log('message');"
[10:33:37] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1444008 <-- but i'm having trouble
[10:33:40] <martndemus> just make sure you comment out all console.log before goin to production
[10:34:02] <bonhoffer> i never get to the console.log
[10:34:18] <bonhoffer> sorry for whitespace issues . . .
[10:34:37] <martndemus> we might need some context here
[10:35:19] <martndemus> bt most likely seems lik data.Weight.length might be 0 or undefined
[10:35:23] <thirdender> bonhoffer: either the SELECT is never changed (event doesn't fire), or data.Weight.length isn't set (for loop doesn't run)
[10:35:52] <bonhoffer> thirdender: got it -- on debugging the select value is a string, i need to cast it
[10:36:13] <thirdender> bonhoffer: cool :-p
[10:37:23] <qvarkk> i print out offset().top first in the bodytag - why does it appear wrong in some browser? https://f4stest.nordic-e.com/
[10:39:01] <bonhoffer> is this an appropriate way to initalize an array: var power = [];
[10:40:13] <thirdender> qvarkk: it could be that the CSS hasn't loaded yet... it may be calculating it before the UL LI list at the top becomes a single row, for instance. Try changing it from $(document).ready to $(window).load
[10:40:31] <thirdender> bonhoffer: yeah, afaik totally appropriate :-p
[10:40:35] <qvarkk> thirdender:  i will,
[10:40:47] <bonhoffer> thirdender: thanks!
[10:40:54] <thirdender> bonhoffer: np :-)
[10:43:25] <qvarkk> thirdender: YOUR ARE NO FUCKING LESS THAN A G O D. GGGG OOOO DDDD
[10:43:39] <qvarkk> I LOVE YOU
[10:43:47] <thirdender> qvarkk: lol :-p not quite there, but thanks :-p
[10:43:53] <snover> wow.
[10:43:58] <qvarkk> thanks!!!!
[10:51:28] <ProLoser|Work> when doing $(someel).load(), in the callback, how do i manipulate the result element and its contents?
[10:51:33] <ProLoser|Work> do i just do $(this)
[10:51:51] <thirdender> $(someel).load("url", function() { $(this)... })
[10:52:14] <thirdender> ProLoser|Work: yes :-p
[10:52:18] <IvanKuzev> jow to remove an item from an jquery array?
[10:52:22] <IvanKuzev> *how
[10:52:42] <ProLoser|Work> cool
[10:53:25] <thirdender> IvanKuzev: are you trying to filter out something by a selector, or do you want to remove an element from the array by index?
[10:53:59] <IvanKuzev> i have an array of all open dialogs...i want to remove a dialog i closed from it
[10:54:35] <thirdender> IvanKuzev: openDialogs.not(closedDialog) will return an array with the closedDialog filtered out
[10:54:51] <IvanKuzev> thanx
[10:54:57] <bonhoffer> hmm. . . this is a tricky one -- right now i'm pulling in json data and populating a table -- but when i chage the select i append the new data to the table. now the table is just getting a lot bigger
[10:55:28] <thirdender> bonhoffer: bigger like wider bigger or bigger like your old data is still there?
[10:55:39] <thirdender> IvanKuzev: np :-p
[10:56:01] <shawn_dones> anyone familiar with jquery mobile
[10:57:16] <quizme> i tried to register some event handlers in a for loop, but my counter only gives the value of the last element.
[10:57:22] <shawn_dones> on mobile safari when i add a site or page to my homescreen the default name for that book mark is pulled from the H tag in the data-role="header" . Is there a way to get that to pull from the title tag instead
[10:58:02] <quizme> how do you iterate on i, so that $('#id_'+i).click gets registered on id_1, id_2 and id_3 ?
[10:58:46] <quizme> anybody know what i'm talking about ?
[10:59:36] <nezZario> quizme: cake ?
[10:59:44] <jo857393> hello there, i have a question, i need to simulate a mouse click on a mac on safari with applescript (do javascript " ….") the problem is the pages links are made with jpane and i can't figure how to write the code, can someone go through it with me?
[11:00:36] <thirdender> quizme: var els = $("#id_1, #id_2, #id_3").click(function() { alert(els.map(function() { return $(this).val(); })); })  ?
[11:01:18] <quizme> thnq
[11:01:39] <thirdender> quizme: if you want to do for more elements, I would recommend adding a class to the elements instead of doing numbered IDs... you can do it with numbered IDs, but... you'd need to build an array of the IDs in a separate for loop. Usually easier just to slap a class on it? :-p
[11:07:22] <IvanKuzev> dialogs.add(newDialog); this dont work...it says dialogs lenght 0 ...and new dialog lenght 1
[11:08:35] <thirdender> IvanKuzev: are you doing dialogs = dialogs.add(newDialog)? If not, I don't think it modifies the original variable
[11:08:47] <JonathanCutrell_> Hey folks. Any beginner to intermediate folks needing help, you're welcome to direct your questions to me.
[11:08:56] <JonathanCutrell_> (and the room.)
[11:09:24] <quizme> <div><img class='bob original' /> <img class='bob hover'/></div>   <--- if "this" is ".bob original", then how do you get "the corresponding "bob hover" in that div block?  .next() ?
[11:09:36] <quizme> .next will return an array right ?
[11:09:41] <quizme> so .next().first() ?
[11:10:20] <thirdender> quizme: .next() should return only one element... .nextAll() would return all of the following siblings
[11:11:06] <IvanKuzev>  <thirdender> how can i have been so stupid
[11:11:34] <ProLoser|Work> we're naming our conference rooms and i am looking to use internet buzzwords. I already have 'Synergy', 'Webscale', 'Ajax', and 'Automagic', need a few more.
[11:11:50] <thirdender> IvanKuzev: lol, that one still trips me up :-p that's why I said "I think" in my response :-p
[11:12:09] <thirdender> ProLoser|Work: don't forget "Cloud"
[11:12:37] <ProLoser|Work> oh right
[11:12:53] <ProLoser|Work> thirdender: is there a longer name? preferably the mashup of 2 other words?
[11:12:57] <ProLoser|Work> like synergy and automagic?
[11:13:26] <thirdender> ProLoser|Work: Umm... "The Cloud"? :-p I'm not a naming person :-p
[11:15:04] <rotozip> I have a jQuery.ajax call that goes out to my DB and gets values that on return I add to an array.  I then dynamically add select boxes and populate the options with the values in the array.  What I am looking for is a way to bind the array to the select options.  Is that possible in jQuery?
[11:17:22] <thirdender> rotozip: bind the array to the SELECT? you can do that with myNewSelect.data("dbData", myDatabaseArray), then get it back later with chosenSelect.data("dbData")
[11:17:43] <thirdender> rotozip: you can do the same thing to bind data to the individual OPTIONs if that's what you want too
[11:18:32] <shesek_> anyone knows why the `focusin()` and `focusout()` methods can't be used to trigger the event, like the rest of the methods can?
[11:19:10] <elHannes> hi peeps
[11:19:50] <rotozip> thirdender:  .data is what I need.   Thanks.
[11:21:08] <thirdender> rotozip: np :-p
[11:22:27] <thirdender> shesek_: not sure... did you try using .trigger("focusin")?
[11:23:09] <shesek_> thirdender, not yet, and its probably .trigger('focus'), but I wonder why... focusin and focusout are the only methods that can
[11:23:18] <shesek_> thirdender, not yet, and its probably .trigger('focus'), but I wonder why... focusin and focusout are the only methods that can't be used for triggering, only binding
[11:23:40] <shesek_> all the other methods are described as "...., or trigger that event on an element."
[11:25:04] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use angularjs?
[11:25:19] <thirdender> shesek_: yeah... the jQuery devs don't always seem to add the shorthand triggers until they are getting used frequently... not sure the exact reasons why... probably code size (my worst guess) .trigger(...) should still work, I think
[11:26:48] <shesek_> nah, it can't be code size, those methods are added dynamically/programmaticlly, not written manually
[11:27:26] <thirdender> shesek_: yeah, I thought that :-p have you looked at the original library? maybe someone commented something?
[11:27:46] <shesek_> possibly... lets see
[11:28:49] <austinbv> can you use $.load with a selector and somehow still keep script tags for execution
[11:29:12] <shesek_> thirdender, seems like its treated the same in the code and should work, just documented wrongly?
[11:29:19] <shesek_> I wonder why it didn't work when I tried it tho
[11:30:03] <thirdender> shesek_: huh... :-p weird
[11:37:37] <Taloncor> I have a question regarding the submit-Event. I'm trying to alter a form before submitting it, but the the values I add in the event handler (via hidden input fields) won't be submitted. Am i doing something wrong here?
[11:39:21] <thirdender> Taloncor: they should be... although the submit event is tricky. Did you test it, and which browser did you use?
[11:40:04] <Taloncor> Latest Firefox, Latest Chrome
[11:40:22] <M4d3L> hi. I try to force user to enter number in a form. I have try this : http://paste2.org/p/1813274
[11:40:32] <M4d3L> but it say event doesnt exist
[11:40:44] <Taloncor> The input fields are added correctly. I can verify that via Firebug
[11:41:45] <thirdender> Taloncor: do you have a page to look at?
[11:42:33] <thirdender> M4d3L: you're calling event "e" in this function (see the part "function(e)")... replace all copies of "event" in your function with "e" and it should work
[11:43:15] <Nicksurf123> Question: How can I find the true length/width of a <pre> element
[11:43:34] <Taloncor> Thirdender: Currently not. Just stumbled upon the problem. It worked fine with a click handler on the submit button, but just doesn't wanna work with the submit event. Just wanted to check if it is a known problem
[11:43:39] <Nicksurf123> how long the unwrapped text inside extends for.
[11:44:29] <thirdender> Taloncor: all kinds of weird things with the submit function in my experience... the problem with putting it on a click handler is that if someone hits Enter in an input and submits the form that way your handler doesn't run :-p not sure... Google may know more
[11:45:45] <Taloncor> Thirdender: Yeah. The submit handler seems like the cleaner way to do it
[11:46:21] <engaged> Is there a way to get every id within form? like foreach(id in form#theFormID) alert(this.id.val())
[11:46:25] <engaged> something like that pseudo code
[11:46:25] <bonhoffer> i got disconnected -- sorry if i missed a reply
[11:48:04] <thirdender> engaged: hmm... alert($("#theFormID *[id]").map(function() { return $(this).attr("id"); }))
[11:48:14] <bonhoffer> so i'm  pulling json data and building a table with it
[11:48:37] <bonhoffer> based on an onchange event of a select box
[11:48:42] <engaged> thirdender: i don't really want to alery, i want to send each value in a key:val to an ajax query
[11:48:44] <M4d3L> thirdender: omg! so stupid error
[11:48:47] <M4d3L> ty
[11:48:49] <engaged> any way to do that?
[11:48:58] <bonhoffer> i want to reload all the data in the table -- so i really just need to delete all rows after the first one
[11:49:17] <thirdender> bonhoffer: $("#tableID tr").not(":first").remove() :-p
[11:49:21] <bonhoffer> i have <tr><th>1</th> . . . </tr> then <tr><td></td>  . . .
[11:49:24] <M4d3L> anyone know how to pass from a field to an other for credit card?
[11:49:32] <M4d3L> (like tab)
[11:49:35] <bonhoffer> thirdender: really, i'll have to read up on that
[11:49:57] <thirdender> M4d3L: $("#newField").focus()
[11:50:14] <engaged> thirdender: anyway to get all the idName:vals into a string somehow?
[11:50:16] <jcrawford> hey guys, how come this is not working for me?
[11:50:17] <jcrawford> $("#header").css("background: url('" + pageBackground + "') no-repeat;");
[11:50:42] <jcrawford> the background image is not added to the div element.  I console.log the pageBackground and it is set to ta URL.
[11:50:49] <thirdender> engaged: var fields = {}; $("#myTable *[id]").each(function() { var field = $(this); fields[field.attr("id")] = field.val(); })
[11:51:02] <jcrawford> in Firebug when I inspect the element I cannot see the background css because it is not in the file and added on load
[11:51:06] <jcrawford> any thoughts?
[11:51:31] <thirdender> engaged: after running that, fields will be an object that can be passed using any of the $.get, $.post, whatever jQuery XHR handlers
[11:51:53] <Taloncor> jcrawford: Shouldn't it be $("#header").css("background", "url('" + pageBackground + "') no-repeat;")
[11:52:15] <engaged> thanks thirdender
[11:52:17] <jcrawford> Taloncor: oh my bad thought it would be simple as what i did, thanks
[11:52:21] <jcrawford> will try your method
[11:53:06] <thirdender> engaged: or... if you want the string (sorry, missed that message), $("#tableID *[id]").serialize() will return a string, but use the inputs NAME attribute as the name
[11:53:15] <jcrawford> Taloncor: your method did not provide the proper results either :(
[11:55:58] <Taloncor> jcrawford: Sorry, assumed that it was due the syntax error ;-)
[11:56:05] <M4d3L> thirdender:  is there way to detect next field automatically?
[11:56:14] <thirdender> jcrawford: Taloncor had the syntax right... are you able to alert(pageBackground) the line before you set it to make sure it's the proper value before you run the code? also, the code is inside a $(document).ready(...) handler, right?
[11:56:42] <jcrawford> yes i can alert the value just fine
[11:56:59] <thirdender> jcrawford: do you have a page to look at?
[11:57:00] <tomasm-> anyone know how to use firebug to stop some runaway jquery code? there is an ajax update that calls itself over and over, and i'd like to stop it so i can see the console.log() entries properly... but it keeps on running!
[11:57:51] <jcrawford> thirdender: unfortunately no it's behine a firewall
[11:57:54] <jcrawford> on the intranet
[11:58:09] <thirdender> M4d3L: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/290535/best-way-to-find-next-form-input-element-in-jquery
[11:58:33] <thirdender> jcrawford: http://pastebin.com/ example? :-p
[11:59:20] <thirdender> tomasm-: if you have the Web Developer Toolbar installed, turn off Javascript? :-p
[11:59:23] <jcrawford> thirdender: sure
[11:59:38] <Taloncor> thirdender: Ok, there is obviously a problem with my "submit"-event solution. Even if i change the value of an existing field, it won't change the submitted value
[12:01:16] <jcrawford> thirdender: http://jsfiddle.net/bNY9g/
[12:01:47] <jcrawford> thirdender: actually http://jsfiddle.net/bNY9g/1/
[12:02:10] <thirdender> Taloncor: okay... stupid thing to try... at the end of your .submit handler, return false... right before that do a setTimeout(function() { myForm.submit(); }, 1)
[12:02:25] <thirdender> Taloncor: totally hackish, but maybe enough of a delay? maybe there's still something else going on?
[12:03:16] <jcrawford> thirdender: even better: http://jsfiddle.net/bNY9g/2/
[12:03:18] <tomasm-> thirdender, the web developer toolbar is not responding.... the 1st level dropdowns shown but i cant get to the option to shut off js...just stays frozen... =(
[12:03:55] <jcrawford> thirdender: jsfiddle put the initialization of the pageBackground variable after the inclusion of the document load js so i just moved it around so that it was defined before, still not working in JSFiddle or on my page :D
[12:03:59] <thirdender> tomasm-: lol, ouch :-p maybe slow your AJAX loop somehow? increase delay
[12:04:11] <Taloncor> thirdender: Won't that lead to an endless loop? Trying to submit the form will trigger the event handler again and so on
[12:06:33] <thirdender> Taloncor: good point... umm... there's always ways to clear all the submit handlers, but there are other problems if the user stops the page loading, etc. Harumph :-p Do you have code that can be viewed?
[12:06:42] <engaged> if I am doing $("#id").addClass('theclass') it's getting added but the base css is overwriting it... how do I make it so this addClass overrides the current css?
[12:07:19] <Taloncor> thirdender: I'll get back as soon as i have some example code. For now it's 9pm and i really should go home ;)
[12:07:54] <thirdender> Taloncor: lol :-p sleep well my friend :-p
[12:08:32] <thirdender> engaged: the other CSS is overriding .theclass styles?
[12:08:41] <engaged> yes
[12:08:43] <jcrawford> this is VERY ODD
[12:08:50] <tomasm-> doesnt firefox have independent processes for different tabs, these days? ie i should be able to stop the runaway js just by closing one tab
[12:08:52] <engaged> is there a way to make it so the addClass override?
[12:09:11] <engaged> its juqeryui from google's cdn so I can't change the css
[12:09:21] <thirdender> engaged: you need to make your new CSS more specific than your original CSS... take your original CSS selector, copy/pasted it, add .theclass to that selector... it will make it more specific and pick up those styles instead
[12:09:35] <thirdender> jcrawford: agreed :-p\
[12:09:54] <thirdender> tomasm-: that's Chrome :-p not sure what Firefox does for process management
[12:09:57] <jcrawford> i got it
[12:09:59] <jcrawford>     $("#header").css("background", "url('" + pageBackground + "') no-repeat");
[12:10:04] <jcrawford> not quite sure what changed though lol
[12:10:10] <thirdender> jcrawford: lol :-p the single quotes?
[12:10:28] <jcrawford> also think it was the ; after no-repeat
[12:10:43] <thirdender> jcrawford: oooooh... wow... :-p
[12:10:54] <jcrawford> yep having the ; there does not work
[12:11:01] <jcrawford>     $("#header").css("background", "url('" + pageBackground + "') no-repeat"); <---- Works
[12:11:08] <jcrawford>     $("#header").css("background", "url('" + pageBackground + "') no-repeat;"); <-- No Workie
[12:11:13] <thirdender> jcrawford: learn something new every day :-p weird that it was that particular though
[12:11:27] <jcrawford> thanks guys
[12:11:39] <elpancho> remove the '
[12:11:46] <elpancho> you dont need them when specifying a background url
[12:12:00] <elpancho> url(whatever.jpg) is perfectly fine, doesnt need ('whatever.jpg')
[12:12:14] <Zogot> Ahoy all
[12:12:16] <elpancho> in fact, there's a bug in IE5.5 on OSX that wont read a url that has a ' in it
[12:12:17] <elHannes> heyho is someone bored / has free time on his hand to test a (new) plugin of mine? ^^ ( https://github.com/lautr/asfar )
[12:12:42] <codercube> elpancho: who supports IE5.5 now? :)
[12:12:59] <jedimind> codercube, noone, i just figured its an interesting tidbit :)
[12:13:03] <jedimind> ie5.5 on osx at that :0
[12:13:07] <Kzim> hi
[12:13:19] <jedimind> elHannes, does your plugin do anything that bbq doesnt ?
[12:14:03] <jcrawford> so guys if i have #header { } in an external css file and then i use jquery to add some CSS does it override the external style sheet?
[12:14:13] <jedimind> yes
[12:14:16] <jcrawford> gah
[12:14:29] <Kzim> i have 2 dict of the same data and same structure. i don't want duplicate between the 2 how can i compare them of make a diff plz ?
[12:14:30] <jedimind> jquery injects the styles inline which override what you have in your css file
[12:14:35] <jedimind> i mean it'll override only the things you specify
[12:14:36] <jcrawford> I need to somehow add to it but I wont know the image urls as they are cached until after the page loads which is why I was trying to inject them D:
[12:14:39] <jedimind> it wont null all your styles
[12:14:43] <jcrawford> hmm ok
[12:14:44] <jcrawford> odd then
[12:15:10] <bonhoffer> if i have a 2d array -- say, sizes = [1,2,3; 1,2,4; 5,6,7]; how would i get 1,2,4
[12:15:24] <bonhoffer> in matlab sizes(2,:)
[12:15:41] <tomasm-> thirdender, nope, the web dev toolbar only takes effect after you reload the page, doesnt help me when i need to use console.log() to debug what's going on and i can't even figure it out because the log gets flooded.....
[12:15:47] <thirdender> bonhoffer: sizes[1] (0 indexed arrays)
[12:15:59] <thirdender> tomasm-: sorry :-p
[12:16:12] <bonhoffer> thirdender: so sizes[1] gives you the second row
[12:16:18] <elHannes> jedimind: cant open the page (bbq) at the moment, does it work (exclusively) with shebangs or does it support the html5 history interface?
[12:16:20] <bonhoffer> what about the second column?
[12:16:23] <codercube> anyone got experience with jquery ui sortable?
[12:17:39] <thirdender> bonhoffer: wait, sorry, have to reformulate as a Javascript array for me to wrap my head around this :-p I read as [[1,2,3], [1,2,4], [5,6,7]], is that correct?
[12:17:51] <panfist> i have a bunch of links on a page that will navigate around a site if the user doesn't have javascript enabled, now i'm trying to capture clicks on those links and use ajax to only replace the parts that change if the user does have javascript enabled,
[12:17:52] <bonhoffer> ok, so var items = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]; -- to get the second column [2,4,6] i imagine i would have to write  a loop . . .
[12:18:01] <bonhoffer> thirdender: yes
[12:18:03] <bonhoffer> you got it
[12:18:27] <elHannes> @panfist  check the link to my project i just posted xD
[12:18:32] <bonhoffer> i just needed to see how js does multi-dimensional arrays -- but i'm unsure of how to to pull columns
[12:18:46] <panfist> i was wondering if jquery has a method to parse the target and query string of links that are clicked on...i saw an answer on stack overflow but it's basically a bunch of people saying, 'here's a method to do it and you don't need jquery, paste it in your code"
[12:18:47] <elHannes> as long a sthe content area has a unqiue xpath it should work
[12:19:18] <panfist> elHannes: this one? https://github.com/lautr/asfar
[12:19:26] <elHannes> yes
[12:19:35] <mbtez> how do i update an iframe from inside the iframe w/ JS?
[12:19:36] <notpizza> i'm having trouble getting the not() function to work correctly...i created a custom json tree viewer. i want to make it show only nodes that have spans with text that matches the input field. I did parents = $('span:contains("'+query+'")').parents('.NodeContents'); to get all the nodes that get hidden or shown, and subset = $('span').not(':contains("'+query+'")').parents('.NodeContents:visible') to hide the NodeContents that were visible for query text 'r' but
[12:19:40] <mbtez> or with jquery
[12:19:43] <thirdender> bonhoffer: jQuery.map([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], function(row) { return row[1]; })
[12:20:18] <codercube> mbtez : what do you mean by update? refreshing page?
[12:20:23] <mbtez> ya refresh the iframe
[12:20:36] <thirdender> bonhoffer: Array.prototype.map is another option, but not supported in older versions of IE, so you'd need the code from https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map#Compatibility if you want to do it without jQuery
[12:20:43] <mbtez> i tried document.href, document.location.href, window.href, window.location.href, top.location.href, none of them did the right thing, most did nothing :P
[12:20:50] <Kzim> anyway to check if a value is in a dict ? exept by the key
[12:21:04] <codercube> mbtez:  location.reload(true) should work
[12:21:10] <mbtez> no no
[12:21:15] <mbtez> i want to specify the URL
[12:22:15] <codercube> mbtez : window.location = 'jquery.com'
[12:22:22] <mbtez> no good, doesn't work
[12:22:30] <codercube> it should
[12:22:43] <mbtez> Refused to display document because display forbidden by X-Frame-Options.

[12:23:07] <magnetik> Hi
[12:23:14] <panfist> elHannes: i'm not sure if i understand the project correctly. i'm looking at your 'complete page as ajax response' demo and whenever i click on a link, even if i clicked it before, it makes a request to the server. is it supposed to work like that?
[12:23:20] <codercube> mbtez : describe what you are trying to do
[12:23:27] <mbtez> i have a facebook canvas app in an iframe
[12:23:35] <mbtez> i need the 'enter' link to do something different
[12:23:46] <mbtez> depending on whether or not the user is logged into facebook...which i can test with the "response" event
[12:23:52] <magnetik> I've a little problem. My code is here : http://pastebin.com/q2XuK4nW My ajax function get RDF/XML, and I want to print the raw result into a textarea (which ID is ouput), but it looks like that jquery is "interpreting" my xml
[12:23:59] <mbtez> but the updated URL is dependent upon part of the "response" object
[12:24:14] <mbtez> so i can't just have an <a href and event.preventDefault
[12:24:27] <mbtez> i guess i'm stuck using JSON then
[12:25:33] <thirdender> magnetik: you can specify how you want jQuery to interpret the return value using the "contentType" of $.ajax: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:26:03] <elHannes> panfist: yes, burt the requets is only via ajax and the return is inserted in the existing page, so there is no actual reload of the page, only the partial information is changed
[12:26:06] <magnetik> humm, the problem is in the response
[12:26:08] <magnetik> not in the reques
[12:26:32] <elHannes> panfirst: while the url is changed in a way that resembles a "normal" click / url
[12:27:17] <thirdender> magnetik: sorry, you want "dataType" :-p my bad... "dataType": "text" should work?
[12:28:30] <magnetik> thirdender, sounds good, but .. uem does not work
[12:28:48] <McBoingBo> hey guys, how can I replace an HTML div with a set content? I am trying to use jQuery(#ga-test).html("Hello World!"); and its not working, any ideas?
[12:28:53] <magnetik> looks like everything that is between < > is removed
[12:29:57] <elHannes> well, got to hit the road, cya
[12:30:02] <codercube> McBoingBo : what the console says?
[12:30:16] <magnetik> nevermind, thanks a lot thirdender, it works ! :)
[12:30:31] <thirdender> magnetik: lol... um... jQuery > 1.5? it might be trying to convert the response... how do you want to receive the response? try "json" instead and see if the returned data structure works for your purposes?
[12:30:35] <McBoingBo> didnt check console, just viewing page source
[12:30:42] <magnetik> thirdender, it's working well, thanks :)
[12:30:54] <thirdender> magnetik: sorry, scrolled up :-p cool :-)
[12:31:09] <Eviltwin> Does jQuery UI dialog have built-in support for closing when clicking outside of it?
[12:31:24] <codercube> McBoingBo : check chrome console than, there should be the answer
[12:32:23] <thirdender> McBoingBo: also, are you running your code *after* the page loads, using something like $(document).ready(function() { // your code here })
[12:40:59] <PaperBoy> ok so i have this situation.. since my foreach loop ittirates through the db results .. and spits out all the items in the list in to my div, then no matter what i do all the #id's or classes will be the same.. my only chance is to append the note_id to the #id in wich case every item in the list will have its own #id .. all is well except i still need to referance this #id in to javascript
[12:40:59] <PaperBoy> and since im appending note_id.. how do i do that in the js file?
[12:41:55] <Eviltwin> PaperBoy: Can you pastebin an example of what you're talking about?
[12:42:22] <Eviltwin> Code is king
[12:42:34] <Eviltwin> We all speak code here
[12:43:54] <PaperBoy> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/7XJfMeXJ
[12:44:09] <PaperBoy> the js is in a seperate file
[12:45:20] <ohcibi> i have a func which i want to execute on blur of a specific element... but i need the keycode of they key that was pressed to actually blur the element... is this somehow possible? the blur event itself has an undefined keycode propertie
[12:45:45] <thirdender> PaperBoy: what's your goal? Why do you need to reference individual rows?
[12:46:24] <thirdender> PaperBoy: there should be some way to make that happen cleanly... e.g. $(".table_row:eq(3)") will get the 4th table row, but need to know which ones you want, when and what to do with them :-p
[12:46:28] <PaperBoy> thirdender.   im listing all the contents  of the db result..  so its a list of articles..  on click of title of article i want the div to grow and display the whole article
[12:47:11] <PaperBoy> each article will have its note_id to keep it unique.. and im will be appending that to the #id of each article
[12:47:17] <PaperBoy> but how can i pass that append to the js file?
[12:47:23] <codercube> PaperBoy: if I got the point right, you can do $(".note_title").click(function(){ $(this).closest("tr").find("note_content") .... }
[12:48:03] <codercube> "note_content" should be ".note_content"
[12:48:24] <thirdender> PaperBoy: codercube nailed it :-p $(".note_title_link").click(function() { $(this).parents(".table_row").find(".note_content").animate({ "height": 100 }, 1000); return false; })
[12:48:25] <PaperBoy> it is.
[12:49:17] <PaperBoy> well considering im a noob i cant really figure otu what those funcitons do
[12:49:22] <PaperBoy> but alright ill try to use this
[12:50:07] <PaperBoy> awesome
[12:50:09] <PaperBoy> than you both
[12:50:10] <codercube> PaperBoy: closest searched up the tree for a parent TR, and then you just use find to search down the tree
[12:50:13] <PaperBoy> thank*
[12:50:17] <YammYgirlcoding> hello everyone!
[12:51:03] <YammYgirlcoding> I'm using jquery slider here http://solveena.com. But when i enable the animation (setting timeout != 0), the animation works, but background under it disappears. Any idea?
[12:51:21] <Kzim> how can i remove from list1 the dict that are in array2 plz
[12:51:30] <PaperBoy> thirdender: thanks for the code. How can i make that toggle on click?
[12:54:24] <thirdender> PaperBoy: what's the default height of .note_content before the animate?
[12:54:24] <Eviltwin> PaperBoy: Sorry, just got back
[12:54:40] <Eviltwin> PaperBoy: One not <?= $foo ?> means <? echo $foo; ?>
[12:54:46] <Eviltwin> Might be useful for you
[12:54:52] <Eviltwin> note*
[12:54:58] <YammYgirlcoding> ah the bug happens in IE7
[12:55:13] <codercube> Eviltwin if short_tags are on ;)
[12:55:18] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:55:19] <PaperBoy> thirdender: i would say 30px
[12:55:28] <PaperBoy> thats the start height
[12:56:06] <thirdender> PaperBoy: http://pastebin.com/USLhaH7i
[12:56:38] <igore> !help with .wrap()
[12:56:54] <igore> I'm trying to take a collection of elements and wrap them with another element.
[12:56:57] <PaperBoy> thirdender: thank you so much.  can you animate that wiht a non abstracut syntax?
[12:57:01] <PaperBoy> so its easier to understand?
[12:57:14] <thirdender> YammYgirlcoding: lol :-p simple solution, stop using IE7 :-p could be something with the Flash objects moving over top maybe?
[12:57:27] <igore> This works fine, but when I attempt to do with from a jQuery plugn i created, I don't know how to return the newly wraped element..
[12:57:39] <thirdender> igore: http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[12:57:57] <thirdender> PaperBoy: but the abstract syntax is only one line long....... :-p
[12:58:07] <YammYgirlcoding> thirdender na, it's not flash issue, i put a layer with nothing inside just to test it. and it goes blank too
[12:58:10] <codercube> YammYgirlcoding : by the way you have several errors on your page, 404 for some js files and other stuff.. see console
[12:58:18] <Whirl3d> If I have a div that contains both an anchor element (button) and an input:text element and the form is handling the click event using .on, how can I prevent the field from losing focus if the button is clicked?
[12:58:23] <YammYgirlcoding> codercube i kno
[12:58:24] <igore> I've tested that too.. works fine in normal situation, but in my plugin doens't want to return the wrapped elements..
[12:58:27] <PaperBoy> yeah.. but i cant read it :P
[12:58:41] <YammYgirlcoding> the problem only happens when i turn slider on
[12:58:56] <YammYgirlcoding> if you set its time to 0, you will see the transparency back
[12:59:35] <igore> thirdender: http://jsfiddle.net/U9bUf/2/
[12:59:42] <thirdender> PaperBoy: dang it... make me type it all out :-p http://pastebin.com/cGByeXSR what you wanted?
[12:59:42] <PaperBoy> thirdender, also, the code you gave me.. doesnt work on first click.. it works on second click
[12:59:45] <PaperBoy> any dieas?
[12:59:48] <PaperBoy> heheh
[12:59:52] <igore> take a look at the 4th line from the bottom
[12:59:57] <thirdender> PaperBoy: ah, dang it :-p yeah, a moment...
[12:59:57] <igore> thats the only one in question..
[13:01:04] <igore> the plugin returns the collection with this line: return this.each(function(){}
[13:01:38] <igore> I'm able to access the objects properties and edit them: $(this).val('');
[13:01:50] <igore> However, I'm unable to wrap objects with other elements..
[13:02:41] <igore> and the last line of my plugin, is to wrap the elements in the collection:  $(this).wrap(myFormm);
[13:02:42] <_thumper_> Hi, I am using FancyBox to display a div. I am resizing the div displayed. How do I reset the position of the FancyBox to CenterScreen?
[13:04:07] <Eviltwin> igore: Looks like you didn't read about Data after all
[13:04:51] <thirdender> PaperBoy: it's still only showing on the second click? dang it, I think the logic is right... what am I missing...?
[13:05:06] <igore> I did read it Eviltwin!
[13:05:09] <igore> thanks for the read..
[13:05:33] <vasa> hello everyone
[13:05:33] <igore> I'm just stuck fixing bigger problems and gettign the thing to work instead of re-writting thigns that are already working..
[13:05:43] <misc--> hello... I am having trouble with a regexp... how would I replace a string so that it just has the first 20 words? I have this:  .replace(/^((.*[\s,\.-:;]+){20,20})?.*/, "$1")); but this just strips the last word in the string, not all words after 20 words
[13:06:01] <igore> I'm loosing steam fast and I just need to fix a few things that are preventing full funtionality of beta version
[13:06:23] <igore> I would appreciate it if you could give me another little hint regarding the 4th line from the bottom..
[13:06:41] <igore> and why its not wrapping an element around the $(this) element
[13:06:48] <igore> or maybe its wrapping..
[13:07:06] <igore> but its not being returned properly.
[13:07:36] <vasa> is it possible, by mouse position to get an element id just by hovering over it, say mouse hovers over any element, a function gets activated and shows that id. i have many elements and wish to not have to predefine seperate function for each element.
[13:07:52] <igore> eviltwin: any thouhgts?
[13:08:28] <PaperBoy> thirdender: still there? is it problematic?
[13:08:32] <Eviltwin> igore: http://jsfiddle.net/Rakjv/
[13:10:04] <igore> Eviltwin, thank you! I'll look at your example and try to apply it to my code..
[13:10:12] <Nicksurf123> Question: How can I find the inner length/width of a <pre> element
[13:10:19] <Nicksurf123> how long the unwrapped text inside extends for inside
[13:10:54] <Eviltwin> Nicksurf123: Meaning what?
[13:10:54] <devnill> .width()
[13:11:22] <codercube> vasa: how do you distinguish elements? are these all divs? or some with a defined class?
[13:11:27] <devnill> to get the actual width of the contents subtract the padding and the width
[13:11:29] <vasa> yes
[13:11:36] <devnill> *margin
[13:11:38] <devnill> not width
[13:11:50] <vasa> i just don't wish to create a seperate function for each element
[13:11:51] <thirdender> misc--: "a b c d".replace(/^((.+?\b\s+\b){2}).*/, "$1") // replace 2 with 20 or your desired number or words
[13:11:56] <Nicksurf123> Eviltwin: If you have text in a <pre> div it will continue on forever inside without wrapping. THe bottom will hae a horizontal scroll bar
[13:12:05] <thirdender> PaperBoy: not sure... do you have a page I can look at?
[13:12:08] <codercube> vasa: describe what you are trying to do
[13:12:23] <vasa> hold on i'll make it in pastebin
[13:12:36] <Nicksurf123> Eviltwin: I want to find the length of the inside so I can use jQuery to match it
[13:12:38] <Eviltwin> igore: Try putting "var" in front of the declarations for myForm and myFormm
[13:12:42] <Nicksurf123> make it the width of the div
[13:13:05] <misc--> thirdender: ahhhh, thank you very much. I was so close heh
[13:13:13] <thirdender> misc--: :-p
[13:13:18] <Eviltwin> Nicksurf123: This sounds like a CSS issue
[13:13:37] <yamahaalex> can i set jqueryUI resizable to all corners and edges
[13:13:40] <yamahaalex> like a regular windo
[13:14:11] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/ducPG/18/
[13:14:30] <Nicksurf123> Eviltwin: Is it? I'll give you a better idea of what I want to do
[13:14:36] <Nicksurf123> http://www.alemmedia.com/blog/
[13:14:40] <Eviltwin> Nicksurf123: http://jsfiddle.net/XWjmp/
[13:14:44] <vasa> http://pastebin.com/ckfLjkNj
[13:14:55] <Nicksurf123> the code in the pre elements
[13:15:05] <Nicksurf123> it expands to 1000px with jQuery
[13:15:18] <Nicksurf123> but it does that even for boxes that don't really need it
[13:15:54] <Whirl3d> I can't figure out why my field is losing focus when I am handling the click event (and tried both stop prop, and prev def in the click handler)
[13:15:55] <Nicksurf123> so I want to figure out the inner-length of the text of each pre element and make it expand so that it fits it exactly
[13:16:23] <Eviltwin> Nicksurf123: Have you tried doing a .width() on the pre?
[13:16:45] <codercube> yamahaalex : see jqueryui resizable docs, option handle
[13:17:27] <codercube> vasa: why do you need all these ids?
[13:18:00] <yamahaalex> codercube, i see a lot of options
[13:18:03] <yamahaalex> i dont see one for that
[13:18:15] <vasa> because each element id is saved into a variable, and then #(idname).click could be performed just by one function
[13:18:26] <vasa> instead of many
[13:18:56] <codercube> vasa why can't you do $(".elm").click(function(){ ....  });
[13:19:12] <M4d3L> is there something to manipulate date in jquery? to increment/decrease easily a date?
[13:19:26] <codercube> yamahaalex : http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/ OPTIONS->handles
[13:19:29] <vasa> because i need the actual id name of the element, if you can get me $(".elm").click(function(){ the id of the element that was clicked in var  });
[13:19:39] <Eviltwin> M4d3L: You want to work with the JavaScript Date object
[13:19:57] <devnill> vasa: have you looked at .attr('id')?
[13:20:10] <M4d3L> Eviltwin: this object is so limited
[13:20:19] <Eviltwin> Make a better one
[13:20:29] <M4d3L> I need to compare date
[13:20:31] <vasa> ahhh i didn't try attr('id') can you form me an example please
[13:20:44] <NoiseEee> M4d3L: you can look at http://www.datejs.com/
[13:20:48] <Eviltwin> M4d3L: You mean test whether one is before the other?
[13:21:08] <devnill> id=$("div").attr(id);
[13:21:15] <devnill> that would return the id of div
[13:21:27] <devnill> obviously you would want a more specific selector though
[13:21:39] <M4d3L> Eviltwin: need to test if a date in in a rage of to other date
[13:21:42] <vasa> what i want seems impossible right now
[13:21:44] <devnill> also, id needs quotes inside of attr()
[13:21:44] <M4d3L> two other date*
[13:21:52] <NoiseEee> M4d3L: totally possible with vanilla JS date object
[13:22:05] <codercube> vasa describe your entire task
[13:22:13] <Eviltwin> M4d3L: start.getTime() <= test.getTime() && test.getTime() <= end.getTime()
[13:22:39] <Eviltwin> M4d3L: It's not limited, you just want a function for every conceivable task apparently
[13:22:48] <PaperBoy> thirdender, i just realized the second pastebin was correct..   and works well. Thank you for all your help
[13:23:02] * Whirl3d doesn't want to interrupt, so politely waiting my turn...lemme know, thnx
[13:23:16] <thirdender> PaperBoy: ah, cool :-p I was racking my mind :-p cool :-p
[13:23:21] <devnill> vasa: $(".elm").click(function(){myID=$(this).attr('id') });
[13:23:29] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I don't believe preventing a click will prevent a blur
[13:23:38] <devnill> myID would be the id of the selector
[13:25:18] <PaperBoy> thirdender: question: what if i dont want a static height.. what if i want the hight to be as long as the content natrually?
[13:25:35] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/phVq6/
[13:25:42] <SmartTowel> i got some params im sending to a ajax controller via jquery.  im using stringify but that's making my postRegistry object have an array that has array[2] encoded in json and not as an array.  is there a way i can "arrayify" a javascript object?
[13:25:43] <K3lly22> to go for money free http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?u=R34LD4RK&lang=fr
[13:25:46] <yamahaalex> wtf my jquery resize wont work at all
[13:25:53] <yamahaalex> is there any requirement for the parent container?
[13:26:00] <M4d3L> Eviltwin: between I test I need to increment a year then decrement a day, play with year with no 29 february…
[13:26:09] <tomasm-> hi, how come setting a radio in a set via $('input[name=radioset]').val('checkedvalue') doesnt work? and how can i do what im trying to do?
[13:26:16] <devnill> $(window).resize(function(){do this on resize})
[13:26:26] <M4d3L> its complicated because its for insurance website
[13:26:49] <Eviltwin> M4d3L: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
[13:26:50] <M4d3L> must calculate if the guy have the age he told at the start of the application.
[13:27:16] <yamahaalex> devnill..
[13:27:24] <yamahaalex> thats not jqueryui's resize function
[13:27:24] <Eviltwin> You know that business logic shouldn't be done in JavaScript, right?
[13:27:44] <M4d3L> it is done in php in the backside.
[13:27:46] <vasa> devinill and codercube thank you, devinill you solved my problem thanks alot. :)
[13:27:54] <Nicksurf123> Eviltwin: Are you sure width() on the pre works
[13:28:05] <devnill> .resize() definitely triggers...
[13:28:07] <Nicksurf123> I'm trying it and its giving funny results
[13:28:11] <Eviltwin> Like?
[13:28:12] <devnill> i use it all the time yamahaalex
[13:28:14] <M4d3L> but for the eye of the user, it must show error to the client before he submit the form
[13:28:33] <Nicksurf123> well I think its the size of the div, which is auto so its the size of the code div
[13:28:39] <devnill> http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[13:28:48] <Nicksurf123> which is animated to expand to a hardcoded value
[13:29:01] <Nicksurf123> I simply want to find out how long the text stretches out for
[13:29:15] <Nicksurf123> how long the longest single line is
[13:29:19] <tomasm-> where can i post a suggestion for a jquery feature?
[13:29:20] <cjordan> does anyone know of any problems with .prop() when used inside of an iFrame?
[13:29:40] <friedbyte> with jquery ui, what does it mean when their are ui classes on the wrapping element, but not with the children elements (even though there should be)?
[13:31:24] <codercube> tomasm- : if you need to check a radio button do $("input[name='radioset']).attr('checked', 'checked');
[13:31:45] <yamahaalex> not on jquery's website tomasm-, anywhere but there
[13:32:39] <Whirl3d> Is there any way to override the order of events using jquery. I want the click event to fire before the blur event.
[13:32:50] <Whirl3d> Or I want to stop the blur event, either way.
[13:33:15] <friedbyte> jquery ui, I cannot get .ui-tabs-hide to show up on the tabs . . .
[13:33:17] <codercube> Whirl3d : you can preventDefault click event, and trigger it on blur event
[13:33:35] <friedbyte> or an active state for the navigation, but the tab wrapper has ui classes applied
[13:33:38] <devnill> you could also use a callback whirl3s
[13:33:41] <codercube> Whirl3d : I meant vice versa :)
[13:34:13] <cjordan> I've got a situation where a line of code which sets the disabled property on a text area works great in FF and in IE, but when I run it in the produciton environment it fails silently. The only thing different about the production environment is that the code is run inside of an iFrame (my app lives inside another apps iframe)
[13:34:44] <Whirl3d> Found it: bind to mousedown
[13:34:52] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Not surprising
[13:34:55] <Eviltwin> That's one of the earlier events
[13:34:55] <codercube> cjordan : whats the code
[13:35:40] <cjordan> $('#myid').prop({disabled:bool}); // where bool is a value that gets conditionaly set above...
[13:36:09] <codercube> cjordan : moar code :)
[13:36:21] <Whirl3d> It works, thank goodness. I was freaking out for a minute there.  thanks for your help everybody
[13:36:53] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/ducPG/27/
[13:37:24] <cjordan> what more do you need? that one single line is all ther e is. it works in FF and in IE (when run outside of the iFrame), but not when app is run inside the iFrame.
[13:38:34] <cjordan> I can (and have) verified using the debugger in IE9 that the line of code is being called, it's just that under one set of circumstances it does it's job and in the other it doesn't appear to.
[13:39:24] <cjordan> I even tried upgrading to jq1.7.1, but that had no affect.
[13:39:28] <codercube> cjordan:  where is  your #myid ? main window or iframe?
[13:39:37] <cjordan> iframe.
[13:40:09] <Eviltwin> ?sop
[13:40:10] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[13:40:12] <cjordan> for development the app runs in the main window... but when it's in the production environment, the code all runs inside of another app's iFrame...
[13:40:21] <tomasm-> codercube, i just find it confusing that you have to do val([foo]) on radios, and if you do val(foo) on radios then all the items matching will change it's value attribute rather than do the expected of setting the one desired.... seems like prop('value', 'foo') is more appropriate for that odd behavior....
[13:40:29] <cjordan> ah!
[13:40:40] <cjordan> bot-t... that's got to be it...
[13:40:41] <codercube> cjordan from iframe you should call it like $("#iframeId").contents().find("#myid").prop({ ... });
[13:41:09] <cjordan> but in my development there is no iframe...
[13:41:26] <codercube> iframe is from the same host?
[13:41:36] <cjordan> the part that sucks is that we own both origins.
[13:42:01] <SmartTowel> how can i convert a json object to an array?
[13:42:02] <cjordan> no. two physically different boxes, but we own them both...
[13:42:13] <SmartTowel> i know how to stringify it so that its json encoded.
[13:42:16] <SmartTowel> but i don't want that.
[13:42:24] <SmartTowel> i want it as an array instead.
[13:42:24] <codercube> cjordan has to be one host
[13:42:27] <SmartTowel> that php can read
[13:43:00] <cjordan> yeah, unfortunately, that's not an option... and when I develop there is no iframe involved...
[13:45:06] <cjordan> Thanks guys... that definitely answers the "why"... so now I can more intelligently go about trying to figure out how to get around this. bot-t I'll start with that link you gave me.
[13:45:31] <TimG1> Hi All.  I am trying to do a simple click() and can't seem to get it working.  This should work yeah?  http://pastie.org/2982749
[13:45:51] <codercube> TimG1: no
[13:46:03] <_thumper_> Is there a jquery function OnDivResize?
[13:46:20] <codercube> TimG1 : you should wrap code in $(document).ready(function(){ .. });
[13:47:24] <_thumper_> As in.. how can I capture a div resize?
[13:47:40] <codercube> _thumper_ : use ba-resize plugin
[13:48:04] <TimG1> codercube bahaha!  Thanks so much, that was it.  Many thanks.  =)
[13:48:29] <codercube> _thumper_ : generally its a setTimeout function which checks width/height of an element every n miliseconds
[13:48:34] <devnill> thumper .resize()
[13:48:59] <codercube> devnill : resize() is only for window?
[13:49:13] <cjordan> Hey wait, bot-t, codercube... one question. I'm not trying to affect anything in the main document, only on my own document which just happens to live in an iframe... do you think the same origin policy still applies?\
[13:49:13] <devnill> no
[13:49:23] <devnill> .resize binds to any selector I believe
[13:49:29] <_thumper_> I am using FancyBox, and it is resizing.
[13:49:29] <codercube> devnill : no
[13:49:31] <devnill> $(window).resize is common
[13:49:34] <devnill> but its an event handler
[13:49:36] <_thumper_> I need some way to capture that event
[13:51:42] <codercube> cjordan : do you load jquery in an iframe?
[13:51:47] <cjordan> yes
[13:52:01] <cjordan> the app in the iframe is fully self-contained...
[13:52:17] <codercube> cjordan : hmm.. I think it should work then
[13:52:59] <cjordan> yeah, I started reading on same origin policy, and immedately changed my mind about that being the problem (though I guess it still could be)
[13:53:05] <cjordan> *sigh*
[13:53:50] <cjordan> it would be nice if something was violating the same-origin policy if there was a tool which could tell me that's what was happening.
[13:54:26] <codercube> cjordan console should tell you
[13:54:44] <Websteria> I've got a question about $.when.then on a collection of objects.
[13:54:46] <Websteria> http://pastebin.com/6bFdQWj8
[13:54:48] <_thumper_> Does this make sense?
[13:54:50] <Websteria> Is there a cleaner way to do that?
[13:54:50] <_thumper_> http://pastebin.com/AkNRkjNC
[13:55:03] <_thumper_> (For div resizing event handling)
[13:55:20] <cjordan> it's not.
[13:55:32] <codercube> _thumper_ : yes but you have to use a resize() plugin, by default resize() in jquery is only for window object
[13:55:53] <_thumper_> oh i see
[13:55:56] <cjordan> I wish it were... I put in a breakpoint at the line which calls .prop() and that's the only time that the console tells me anything.
[13:56:01] <Websteria> Anyone?
[13:56:13] <codercube> _thumper_ : the address was http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/ but now its down, donno why
[13:56:21] <risky_s> hi, how do I save input values to an array?
[13:56:47] <cjordan> risky_s loop over them and use .push()
[13:56:58] <_thumper_> Yeah it is down :/
[13:56:59] <codercube> cjordan : code is online?
[13:57:08] <cjordan> behind a firewall...
[13:57:09] <cjordan> :(
[13:57:14] <_thumper_> I will try to find an alternative way
[13:57:14] <Websteria> Anyone willing to help with a deferred .each question?
[13:57:17] <cjordan> I would love it if I could show this in action.
[13:57:30] <MoTiOnXml> with a cloned draggable, how do i offset the clone?
[13:57:36] <cjordan> I'm not certain I could use jsfiddle to try to mock this up or not...
[13:57:59] <MoTiOnXml> i need to sample the event.target for position and i need the draggable to be offset
[13:58:02] <MoTiOnXml> any hints?
[13:58:22] <devnill> whats the question Websteria?
[13:58:28] <YammYgirlcoding> guys I'm using jquery.slider here, and when i turn slider on, it's adding background:rgb(17,17,17) inline to the slide tag. Any idea of what could it be???
[13:58:30] <Websteria> I have this code: http://pastebin.com/6bFdQWj8
[13:58:39] <Websteria> I'm trying to do it more efficiently, and I'm sure there must be a way
[13:58:50] <codercube> _thumper_ : heres the resize() plugin minified code http://jsfiddle.net/5c5xN/
[13:59:11] <Websteria> Basically I have an array of objects in self.options.ModuleDeferred that I want to asynchronusly apply the _doTemplate method to
[13:59:16] <Websteria> and I want to know when everything is done.
[13:59:23] <Websteria> but the way I'm doing it now feels clunky
[13:59:58] <Websteria> What I'd like to say is run _DoTemplate for each of the items (in an $each) and tell me when you're done.
[14:00:08] <Websteria> using .when
[14:00:13] <devnill> can you explain what you want to do with words?
[14:00:18] <Websteria> ok
[14:00:33] <Websteria> If you look at the code you see I need to do a $.when in order to resolve the template, that's the first line
[14:00:43] <Websteria> From there I have an array of objects which I want to asynchronusly process
[14:00:50] <devnill> no, i mean what do you want to do overall
[14:00:55] <devnill> do you need when?
[14:01:00] <Websteria> yes
[14:01:05] <codercube> when is bad
[14:01:08] <devnill> a lot of times deferred isn't needed
[14:01:16] <devnill> have you played with callbacks?
[14:01:17] <Websteria> I'm working on a portal and want to process all of the modules asynchronously
[14:01:32] <Websteria> So when someone's given me a module to render I want to render them all simultaneously
[14:01:44] <Websteria> and know when they are all done.
[14:02:10] <Websteria> A callback would be fine if it were one object, but I may have 5 or 10.
[14:02:49] <devnill> no
[14:03:04] <devnill> how are you being given the things to render?
[14:03:13] <Websteria> They're passed in
[14:03:24] <devnill> and how do you know when its done?
[14:03:27] <Websteria> could be an ajax call, could be anything. This is a widget.
[14:03:33] <devnill> ok
[14:03:34] <Websteria> That's the thing, right now the code works
[14:03:39] <Websteria> It just doesn't seem the most efficient way
[14:03:50] <thirdender> Websteria: keep an array of loading objects... at the end of every load, remove that object from the array and check the array to see if it's empy?
[14:03:54] <thirdender> *empty
[14:04:14] <devnill> ok, so make a variable that is the count() of the array
[14:04:35] <devnill> and with .each do if(!—count){}
[14:04:47] <devnill> when you iterate through to the last it will return true
[14:04:53] <Websteria> still not allowing each object to render simultaneously
[14:04:54] <devnill> thats !- -
[14:04:59] <codercube> bb everyone
[14:05:30] <grillermo> is there a function to do the html function $(element).html('changed') but with an effect, i don't want to chain a fadein and fadeout, it looks ugly
[14:06:06] <yamahaalex> is disallowing resize to be larger than parent, built into jqueryui?
[14:06:13] <thirdender> Websteria: yeah, array list would... every time a new block is added, push it onto the array... when it's done, remove it from the array... it's asynchronous. Every time the array size hits 0 you know you're finished loading.
[14:06:33] <devnill> ^
[14:07:13] <devnill> avoid deferred like the plague.
[14:07:17] <Websteria> But I still have to go through the array one element at a time instead of queueing them all up and letting jQuery do them simultaneously
[14:07:18] <Websteria> Why?
[14:07:29] <devnill> because its not asynchronous
[14:07:54] <thirdender> Websteria: no... you set up a function that loads the modules... that function also adds to the array
[14:08:09] <thirdender> Websteria: you set up another function that handles when a module is finished loading... that also removes from the array and checks length
[14:08:33] <thirdender> Websteria: you call the first function for every new module that's loaded, and that can happen whenever... you do not iterate through the array at any point in time
[14:09:20] <grillermo> i should rephrase my question, is it possible to animate an element(fadein,out) and at the same time(not after, not before), change the html of the element?
[14:09:37] <Websteria> ok, I'll give that a shot...
[14:09:48] <Websteria> thanks
[14:10:22] <thirdender> grillermo: changing the HTML happens in an instant, right?
[14:10:36] <grillermo> thirdender, yes
[14:10:51] <grillermo> thirdender, but an instant AFTER any animation
[14:10:58] <grillermo> or before
[14:11:03] <grillermo> mmm
[14:11:29] <risky_s> can you check if this is correct...http://jsfiddle.net/HKukd/
[14:11:39] <thirdender> grillermo: hmm.... well, I think fadeIn only operates on the opacity, so I think you could still fadeIn and change the content momentarily afterward
[14:12:07] <thirdender> grillermo: although it's going to look jumpy as the new content appears...
[14:12:20] <grillermo> thirdender, yeah, what i'm trying to avoid
[14:12:39] <thirdender> grillermo: is the old content hidden before anything happens?
[14:13:21] <grillermo> thirdender, noup, the content is visible, i want to smoothly change it, but fadeout then html('newcontent') then fadein looks bad
[14:13:43] <thirdender> grillermo: got it... give me a moment to show you what I've done in the past
[14:14:02] <grillermo> thirdender, i would appreciate it thank you
[14:15:03] <thirdender> grillermo: can't find old code, will write something quick :-p a few more moments :-p
[14:15:42] <grillermo> thirdender, take your time, i'll be here as long as needed
[14:16:39] <jcrawford> hey guys is there a way to check a div to see if display: block is in the css?
[14:17:00] <jcrawford> I have 3 different windows that show but they are all sized the same.  They all have close buttons and okay buttons which will do the very same functionality
[14:17:02] <Hopsy> Sugitime: hey
[14:17:12] <jcrawford> rather than write code for all 3 I would like to make the close button determine which window it needs to hide
[14:17:16] <jcrawford> is this possible with JQuery?
[14:17:27] <thirdender> jcrawford: did you try elem.css("display")? or elem.is(":visible") will return true false
[14:17:48] <jcrawford> thanks no i am new and was unaware of elem.is("visible") will try that now
[14:18:11] <thirdender> jcrawford:      :visible :-p
[14:19:46] <jcrawford> ah thanks i would have missed that :D
[14:22:10] <daveluke> hi, can i do a .getJSON to a different domain?
[14:22:16] <daveluke> or is there a special configuration needed
[14:22:22] <Eviltwin> daveluke: see ?sop
[14:22:24] <bot-t> daveluke, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[14:23:16] <daveluke> Eviltwin, is that a restriction on the server or client?
[14:23:23] <Eviltwin> Client
[14:23:32] <NoiseEee> daveluke: you can google about CORS
[14:23:41] <NoiseEee> but the other server must be playing ball
[14:23:47] <Eviltwin> JSONP
[14:25:44] <daveluke> i see
[14:43:03] <Snerf> I am trying in php to send values using json_encode($value) , but value is like this. $value = array("my_value"=>"$value_array"); , where, $value_array is also an array("top=>"1", "left"=>"2") .. inside my JS, I cant seem to get data.my_value.top .. any ideas?
[14:43:52] <Snerf> it just returns it as an "Array"
[14:44:01] <saba> Snerf: you need to parse the JSON string
[14:44:58] <Snerf> saba, yes, I have tried this.. doing $.parseJSON(data.my_value) .. but it just returns "Array" as a seperated string
[14:45:25] <Whirl3d> which is faster? caching a reference to an elements grandchildren (or deeper) in the jquery data object for the element, for using .find each time? $(element).data("deepbutton").hide();  or $(element).find(deepbutton).hide(); ?
[14:45:37] <Whirl3d> *or using
[14:46:07] <saba> Snerf: are you actually doing array("my_value"=>"$value_array")? Aha.
[14:46:21] <saba> you need to remove the quotes, eg "my_value" => $value_array
[14:47:14] <Snerf> saba, oh geez, that was dumb of me.. thanks
[14:47:49] <Snerf> saba, tyou very much
[14:49:25] <Dave_Stein> brain-freeze, which function is the one that does $('#a').first().foo() where it turns me #a again?
[14:49:39] <Dave_Stein> oh it's end
[14:49:40] <Dave_Stein> nm
[14:52:35] <jcrawford> hey guys if i have an ajax request which gets the following json back why is response.status allowing me to get to it?
[14:52:36] <jcrawford> {"output":{"result":"invalid_code"}}
[14:52:56] <jcrawford> sorry response.result i meant
[14:53:09] <snover> seriously?
[14:53:55] <jcrawford> yes seriously :D
[14:54:29] <snover> think about it for a minute.
[14:54:35] <jcrawford> my success funciton is function success(response) { } I am trying to get the result value in there with response.output.result
[14:54:55] <snover> ok see now you just changed what you were saying.
[14:55:07] <jcrawford> yea sorry really sick, and been a long day :D
[14:55:12] <jcrawford> i just get undefined for this
[14:55:29] <ngharo> console.log(response) and check it out
[14:57:22] <jcrawford> hmm some reason it thinks it is xml
[14:57:23] <jcrawford> XML Parsing Error: not well-formed Location: moz-nullprincipal:{e369bc72-cc5a-f847-b80c-7f61e7f2e82d} Line Number 1, Column 1:
[14:57:23] <jcrawford> {"output":{"result":"invalid_code"}}
[14:57:23] <jcrawford> ^
[14:58:49] <ngharo> i'd check the content-type header your server is sending
[14:59:02] <ngharo> but you can try forcing json with datatype: 'json' in your ajax request
[14:59:42] <jcrawford> Content-Type: JSON
[14:59:50] <jcrawford> will try that now
[15:00:45] <snover> lol, that is NOT the content type for json
[15:00:51] <snover> where did you even come up with that?
[15:00:51] <snover> wow.
[15:01:14] <jcrawford> live http headers
[15:01:16] <jcrawford> shows that
[15:01:23] <jcrawford> yea should be application/json right?
[15:02:05] <yamahaalex> why does this jqueryUI work in my head <Style> but not in my external .js
[15:02:09] <ngharo> jcrawford: yeah i think so
[15:05:37] <yamahaalex> nvm i got it
[15:05:44] <yamahaalex> why do functions never seem to have names in jquery
[15:05:59] <yamahaalex> i cant figure out how to name a function and call it in another
[15:07:01] <ngharo> huh
[15:07:13] <yamahaalex> functions always seem to be anonymous
[15:07:23] <yamahaalex> i cant find a good sample online of a declared function called in another method
[15:07:33] <ngharo> var foo = function() {};  function() { foo() };
[15:08:09] <snover> that’s not a good sample either.
[15:08:14] <yamahaalex> why not
[15:08:29] <yamahaalex> crazy its like a function in an anonymous function...
[15:08:49] <yamahaalex> jquery cant just do: functionName(){ code };   ?
[15:09:16] <ngharo> jquery doesnt care how you code javascript.  go for it
[15:09:34] <ajpiano> yamahaalex: please explain what you're actually trying to do?
[15:09:54] <yamahaalex> have one method to handle every main menu botton hover
[15:10:01] <yamahaalex> and changing the title when hovered, etc
[15:10:10] <yamahaalex> and call this method from my initialize function
[15:10:10] <ajpiano> yamahaalex: if you're suggesting that jQuery just be a gigantic smattering of global functions, that clearly doesn't make sense?
[15:10:37] <ajpiano> yamahaalex: why don't you show what you've tried so far ?
[15:11:05] <yamahaalex> oh so i can just call a regular js function and put all my jquery functions in that?
[15:11:23] <ajpiano> yes?
[15:12:40] <yamahaalex> so your saying jquery and javascript... are some how related? =D
[15:13:12] <ajpiano> it's kind of like how, when you put on a parka, you continue to be the same person
[15:14:03] <cjordan> anybody here know much about jQuery expando?
[15:14:36] <yamahaalex> ajpiano
[15:14:39] <yamahaalex> my example: http://pastebin.com/1TTAgrM6
[15:14:43] <yamahaalex> its not working
[15:14:54] <devnill> I'm having a scope issue. I want to make a function that slides the selected content off the screen but it breaks the page. http://pastebin.com/ZSkGTAT3
[15:15:02] <yamahaalex> oops nevermind, its working.
[15:15:06] <yamahaalex> i had an extra )
[15:15:36] <devnill> if i console.log($(this).next())  nothing is returned either
[15:16:08] <ajpiano> devnill: for what it's worth, this is not how one writes a jquery plugin
[15:16:12] <ajpiano> you aren't iterating over the set
[15:16:38] <cjordan> I've got code running in two different places...once in the browser all by itself, and the second is run inside an iframe. My app is fully self-contained though. However, when run from inside the iframe jQuery adds a random attribute to my element, but when run separately, it doesn't appear to.
[15:16:45] <ajpiano> so each one is going to use the height of the first element in the collection
[15:16:56] <cjordan> <textarea name="benefitsFundsUnavailableReason" disabled="" id="benefitsFundsUnavailableReason" style="width: 270px; height: 125px;"/>
[15:16:57] <cjordan> <textarea name="benefitsFundsUnavailableReason" disabled="" id="benefitsFundsUnavailableReason" style="width: 270px; height: 125px;" jQuery17103089776033430672="78"/>
[15:17:58] <devnill> ajpiano: its not a plugin
[15:18:09] <cjordan> the element inside of the iframe (with the jQuery expando attribute on it) does not behave correctly when it's disabled property is set via javascript.
[15:18:16] <ajpiano> devnill: $.fn.foo = function(){} ... is a "plugin"
[15:18:35] <devnill> its just prototyping $jQuery.
[15:18:50] <ajpiano> that's how one creates a jquery plugin
[15:18:58] <ajpiano> inside of that you're suppoed to do return this.each( function() {} );
[15:19:52] <yamahaalex> why doesnt this work?
[15:19:52] <yamahaalex> http://pastebin.com/qi6076N6
[15:20:04] <yamahaalex> same code as before, except tried to make #winMain a global variable
[15:20:18] <ajpiano> yamahaalex: because you can't query the dom before dom ready
[15:20:25] <ajpiano> so $winMain is global... but it didn't get any elements
[15:31:34] <cjordan> I just realized something new about my issue, and now I'm thinking it's not a jQuery issue particularly. Let me explain: I've got a text area that I want to be enabled/disabled based on a user's selection in a select element. No problem there. I decided that I would use a css rule to change the background of the textarea to a gray color and the text to a slightly darker gray. So in my stylesheet I have something like textarea.disabl
[15:32:26] <cjordan> This is working fine in FF and in IE for my development. But in production, the app (which is fully self-contained) runs inside of another app's iframe. It is here that this fails.
[15:33:36] <cjordan> I've noticed now that the textarea actually IS disabled, but my css has not been applied. I assumed that the .prop() method wasn't properly setting the disabled property, but now it appears to be a css thing. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Is there a css IRC channel? :)
[15:34:55] <chee> cjordan: #css
[15:36:32] <cjordan> thanks chee
[15:44:40] <a|i> how to detect when a user navigates away from the page? $(window).unload only works when the user _closes_ the window.
[15:45:23] <razzi> ali, try blur
[15:45:47] <Krinkle> a|i: no not blur
[15:45:54] <razzi> ok, don't
[15:45:56] <a|i> hmm.
[15:45:56] <Krinkle> a|i: onbeforeUunload
[15:45:59] <Krinkle> a|i: onbeforeunload
[15:47:03] <Krinkle> a|i: nevermind. beforeunload is a propietary name for "unload"
[15:47:06] <Krinkle> jQuery uses that already
[15:47:17] <Krinkle> and frankly, if it is only triggered when you close the window, you're mostly doing something wrong
[15:47:29] <Krinkle> it should be triggered when the page is left, no matter how
[15:47:42] <a|i> Krinkle: how do I verify this?
[15:47:45] <Krinkle> Back/Forward button, closing page, different url, clicking link, refresh
[15:47:55] <Krinkle> all those trigger unload
[15:48:13] <a|i> when I navigate away from a page, I lose the web console for that page.
[15:49:17] <a|i> maybe alert works.
[15:49:40] <Krinkle> a|i: yeah
[15:49:55] <Krinkle> a|i: also, if you're using Google Chrome, you can configure console to keep log between pages
[15:51:05] <Krinkle> http://i.imgur.com/GblXc.png
[15:51:07] <Krinkle> a|i: ^
[15:51:25] <a|i> Krinkle: thanks! that's very helpful.
[15:53:42] <monstaRtruck> helow
[15:54:08] <a|i> does multiple calls to $(window).unload mean multiple callbacks, or just the last one?
[15:54:13] <monstaRtruck> umm does jcrop have a default function to select the whole image
[15:54:39] <monstaRtruck> basicly to bring up the cropper box by default
[15:56:05] <dhw> has anyone used this http://jquery.malsup.com/block/ ?
[15:56:38] <dhw> I seem to be having an issue when I am using it and trying to do $.ajax() to get data
[15:56:51] <dhw> it locks up the web browser
[16:07:06] <dhw> oops was not passing the value but the object to the function, got it working now :D
[16:08:18] <astropirate> alas! conference mode!
[16:16:35] <Asido> i have $(dom).fadeOut("slow", function () { alert("done"); });
[16:16:43] <Asido> the callback gets executed many times
[16:16:57] <Asido> like a loop as long as animation still not done
[16:17:22] <Asido> why it can be so?
[16:19:10] <astropirate> Asido, maybe the function/scope this statement is in is being executed multiple times for some reason.
[16:19:23] <astropirate> i'd bet thats whats going on
[16:21:40] <Asido> no, alert shows up only once before call to fade
[16:24:39] <cream> hey there, can anyone tell me how i can pass a variable as parameter to an addeventlistener function besides the event var?
[16:31:15] <Asido> ok, silly me. the selector which fade function was called on returned multiple doms
[16:31:20] <Asido> which caused multiple callbacks
[16:37:22] <Guest38460> I've always sort of wondered this, in this simple code snippet I wrote, can I be sure that I'll selecting the li elements with the <div>s removed? If not, is there any way I can guarantee this?
[16:37:32] <Guest38460> https://gist.github.com/a717160e218354100bd9
[16:38:34] <Guest38460> Also, thanks in advance :)
[16:46:06] <razzi> Guest38460 get a different nick
[16:46:07] <sahbeewah> Well, considering you're removing all the divs beforehand, yes that'll guarantee it
[16:46:29] <shoelessone> razzi: done!
[16:47:12] <shoelessone> sahbeewah: I know I'm removing them before, but I though the Async nature of JS means that the the second command could be called before the previous command was complete?
[16:47:37] <astropirate> shoelessone: only IO, timer events are async
[16:47:45] <astropirate> rest of code is executed in order
[16:47:53] <butch128> I'm having issues with jQuery Tools validator plugin, does anyone here have experience with it?
[16:48:01] <shoelessone> astropirate: <3 Thank you!
[16:48:09] <astropirate> :D
[16:48:36] <butch128> the "onFail" function is firing, and putting the text i entered from the form INTO the error message... but it lets the form submit fine
[16:48:59] <astropirate> how silly of it
[16:50:06] <razzi> shoelessone, these kind of question can be answered easily by yourself with debugging, ie ... console.log( $("#stuff li div") ); at start and end of your code
[16:50:48] <shoelessone> razzi: yes, I could make sure my code is running properly (I did!), but I wasn't sure if this was an absolute, as in a rule or just because my browser happens to be running this way
[16:52:21] <shoelessone> razzi: I mean, I'm already using this code (well, something similar) but again, am always worried I'll encounter some situation on some browser where it does not behave as I'd expect. Anyway, I was more interested in this as a general rule (ie as astropirate mentioned IO/timer events are async, but other things are not)
[16:54:07] <astropirate> shoelessone: javascript is for the most part, executed the same on all platforms... the difference is mostly the functions/API's implemented in the browser
[16:55:39] <shoelessone> Sweet. I guess I'm just used to thinking about io related stuff, for instance calling $("div").animate(....); a bunch of times without using callbacks, .stop(), etc will result in things being all crazy
[16:58:19] <astropirate> shoelessone, well thats because those methods use timers internally
[17:03:24] <cream> hey there, can anyone tell me how i can pass a variable as parameter to an addeventlistener function besides the event var?
[17:03:40] <FoolsRun> Anyone know a plugin off the top of their head that can slide the entire page content horizontally? Basically like tabs, but moving the whole page like a virtual desktop
[17:13:55] <razzi> cream, do you mean with .bind()?
[17:14:41] <cream> hey razzi , i have a function popup(e) that i give to addeventlistener of an element
[17:14:51] <cream> i want to add more parameters to that function
[17:15:03] <cream> but i can't seem how
[17:15:10] <razzi> if you use .bind() you can pass params
[17:16:00] <Gualtherus> Hello, I'm working on a new site with the jQuery Cycle plugin but the problem is my first image doesn't appear until you click previous or next. I've posted the code I use on top of the slide. Anyone got a solution? http://gualtherus.com/newsite/work/john-lennon
[17:16:57] <cream> ah o tnhx razzi
[17:17:14] <cream> just curious, is it impossible using only javascript?
[17:18:06] <snover> if you think jquery is something other than javascript, you are gravely mistaken.
[17:18:14] <yogurt_truck> cream: considering jquery is only javascript, then no it's not impossible
[17:18:45] <cream> yogurt_truck: ehe ok but i meant using native js methods
[17:19:27] <abjorn> how do you think jQuery does it?
[17:19:31] <abjorn> with native js methods
[17:22:13] <FoolsRun> I'm looking for a nice simple plugin that will let me, on a click, scroll a whole page's content off the left and new content in the right, but without a horizontal scrollbar
[17:23:16] <b1llydev> so what are some benifits of using a mac pro over a windows pc
[17:24:16] <yogurt_truck> what's a benifit?
[17:25:27] <b1llydev> benefit
[17:26:27] <yogurt_truck> why did you come to #jquery to ask such a yahoo answer-ish question?
[17:28:08] <b1llydev> rather get real time responses from people that use them on a daily basis
[17:28:42] <Gualtherus> Hey, I'm working on a new site with the jQuery Cycle plugin but the problem is my first image doesn't appear until you click previous or next. I've posted the code I use on top of the slide. Anyone got a solution? http://gualtherus.com/newsite/work/john-lennon
[17:32:39] <DobreJoe> hi, I'm preventing clicks on <a href> but I would like to allow clicks on certain class. I'm using e.preventDefault(). How could I override that for only a certain class of hrefs?
[17:33:20] <ajpiano> DobreJoe: $("a:not(.certainClass)").click(fn) or $("a").not(".certainClass").click(fn) ....
[17:33:39] <DobreJoe> ajpiano tnxs!
[17:34:01] <lumio> hello... I need to animate the background-position... but every step it should get repositioned by an exact number like step1: 0, step2: 192, step3: 192*2, step4: 192*3 ... and so on... is there an easy way to do that with jquery?
[17:37:59] <_thumper_> Hi. Would ajaxStart() fire when an Asp.Net UpdatePanel is being refreshed?
[17:41:43] <guy> anyone is using stackoverflow here?
[17:43:27] <snover> no, nobody ever uses that.
[17:59:11] <Gualtherus> Hey, I'm working on a new site with the jQuery Cycle plugin but the problem is my first image doesn't appear until you click previous or next. I've posted the code I use on top of the slide. Anyone got a solution? http://gualtherus.com/newsite/work/john-lennon
[18:10:55] <guy> can I get some help here? to vote-up to reopen this question
[18:10:58] <guy> http://facebook.stackoverflow.com/questions/8425097/facebook-developer-account-disabled-lack-of-communication
[18:22:08] <FoolsRun> Does anyone know a plugin or easy technique for scrolling a whole page horizontally to reveal a new "page" (actually just another div on the same page)? I can't figure out how to describe it any better than that.
[18:22:17] <FoolsRun> Like a carousel but for a whole page worth of content
[18:23:30] <fission6> i want to display a tooltip when a user first loads on a page, to signal that they can click on a button. once the user clicks on the button i want to then remove the tool tip and the click handler. whats a good approach to handle the click, then destroy the element and unregister the click handler
[18:23:38] <b1llydev> if i use a while loop
[18:23:48] <b1llydev> will it continue on the rest of the script while the loop is true
[18:23:58] <b1llydev> condition*
[18:24:09] <b1llydev> or does it hold up and wait for the iteration to stop before it continues
[18:25:07] <yamahaalex> is this safe practice =D
[18:25:08] <yamahaalex> $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().css('display', 'none');
[18:25:37] <b1llydev> sure
[18:25:57] <yamahaalex> cool
[18:26:33] <yamahaalex> do you think its possible to say if height = 100%
[18:26:39] <yamahaalex> or would it need to be an absolute value
[18:29:40] <yamahaalex> if($(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().css('height', '100%')){
[18:29:40] <yamahaalex>   			alert("100");
[18:29:40] <yamahaalex>   		}
[18:29:55] <yamahaalex> that is not working as an if statement
[18:30:05] <yamahaalex> its making the div 100%, then throwing the alert
[18:30:12] <yamahaalex> i only want it to throw the alert if the div was already 100%
[18:32:59] <yamahaalex> it seems impossible to say if height = 100%
[18:33:05] <yamahaalex> it only seems to recognize px
[18:41:45] <yamahaalex> if($(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().css('top') > '50px'){
[18:41:48] <yamahaalex> why doesnt that work
[18:43:36] <yamahaalex> it does work, once
[18:43:45] <yamahaalex> but i have a draggable div
[18:43:58] <yamahaalex> and if i move it about 50px, then back below, then click, it doesnt do it
[18:44:17] <fission6> can you compare string as if they were numbers?
[18:44:36] <fission6> loos odd yamahaalex
[18:45:56] <yamahaalex> loos odd?
[18:46:26] <yamahaalex>  ok. so i have an if statement for .css('top', '50px'){ ... if i manually set top: 60px in css, the if statement works.
[18:46:31] <yamahaalex>  but im using a draggable div. if i move it below then back above, the if statement does not work again
[18:47:33] <yamahaalex> the if statement no longer throws the alert if i move above 50px then back below
[18:47:40] <yamahaalex> even though i can see the top=xxx changing in chrome dev tools while I move the div
[18:51:30] <yamahaalex> i think this is the problem, rather than grab the .css('height', 'x', i need to grab this:
[18:51:31] <yamahaalex> element.style {
[18:51:31] <yamahaalex> left: 52px;
[18:51:31] <yamahaalex> top: 111px;
[18:51:31] <yamahaalex> }
[18:51:41] <yamahaalex> because that is what i see moving in chrome tools
[18:51:52] <yamahaalex> how can i use if statement with those variables?
[19:07:10] <yamahaalex> how can i get offset.left
[19:07:13] <yamahaalex> in an if statement
[19:07:32] <yamahaalex> this is from jquery site:
[19:07:39] <yamahaalex> var offset = $(this).offset();
[19:07:41] <yamahaalex> $("#result").text(this.tagName + " coords ( " + offset.left + ", " +
[19:07:41] <yamahaalex>                                   offset.top + " )");
[19:08:20] <yamahaalex> i need to turn that into if $(this).offset().offset.top > '50px'){}
[19:08:26] <yamahaalex> but that doesnt seem to work
[19:10:47] <yamahaalex> from what I interprit, this should work
[19:11:00] <yamahaalex> if($(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().offset().top > '50px'){
[19:20:48] <yamahaalex> why is or operator || breaking my statement
[19:20:56] <yamahaalex> if(position.top > '0') || (position.left > '0') {
[19:24:43] <yamahaalex> nvm, missing parenthesis
[19:24:51] <yamahaalex> is there no way to get position.right or position.bottom?
[19:27:23] <yamahaalex> i need to either get position from right, or if with < 100%
[19:27:25] <yamahaalex> pleaseee
[19:44:18] <Whirl3d> yamahaalex, do you realize that you are the only person that has said anything since 11:45
[19:45:20] <Whirl3d> and it's probably not the operator || that's breaking. You won't get the value of position.top to be greater than the string '0' || the position.left to either.
[19:49:19] <igore> Hello, I need to wrap a collection of elements using a jQuery plugin.
[19:50:25] <Whirl3d> you have to offer more information than that. You haven't even asked a question...
[19:54:12] <igore> Whirl3d: Let me provide you with some code.
[19:55:23] <igore> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/REuyH/20/
[19:55:46] <igore> here is the simple version of what I'm trying to do with a plugin. Its for inline editing.
[19:56:06] <igore> I'd like to be able to create editable input elements on the fly.
[19:58:27] <igore> Whirl3d: here is my plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/XNBYE/
[19:58:51] <igore> the code that is giving me the problem is in the 4th line from the bottom
[19:58:59] <igore> $(this).wrap('<form>');
[19:59:10] <igore> it doesn't want to wrap $(this) with the form element..
[19:59:19] <igore> however, .append() works..
[19:59:39] <igore> (but not with an input element of course, only if I use a div, span, etc..)
[20:00:43] <Whirl3d> try $(this).wrap ("<form></form>");
[20:00:54] <Whirl3d> not sure if that'll work, but it's worth a try
[20:01:33] <igore> nope, doesn't. :(
[20:02:01] <Whirl3d> whaddya get when you console.log(this)?
[20:02:06] <igore> if you look at the example I sent earlier (http://jsfiddle.net/REuyH/20/) it shows that .wrap works..
[20:02:14] <igore> I get the <input> element..
[20:03:00] <igore> I am also able to bind events, add classes and values to $(this), but when it comes to .wrap(), then nothing
[20:05:39] <Whirl3d> I have a terrible time with plugin writing, so I am not the right person to offer any help. I do know that people often mess up $(this) and 'this' inside the plugin...perhaps you should double check your use of $(this) and 'this'...
[20:06:50] <igore> when would i use just 'this'?
[20:07:26] <igore> I unnderstant that this would be a pure javascript function being called via 'this'
[20:07:47] <igore> and if I want to use jQuery it needs to be jQuery(this)
[20:08:08] <Whirl3d> Currently, you use it about 5 times, I think. I just am not sure when it's appropriate. For example, you got the this.each(function () { part correct as far as I know, but inside there, I get confused.
[20:08:32] <Whirl3d> ?.closure
[20:08:33] <bot-t> Whirl3d, #7318 (Support Closure Compiler ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS ... - Opened 3 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7318
[20:08:59] <igore> I'm trying console.log(jQuery(this))
[20:09:03] <igore> give me a sec
[20:09:12] <igore> I'm starting to see what your getting at..
[20:10:01] <igore> Whril3d: this is what I get in the console:
[20:10:02] <igore> [input#checklistTitle.idleField Checklist]
[20:10:53] <igore> Seems like a jQuery object
[20:11:20] <igore> not understanding the diff. between jQuery(this) and this
[20:11:57] <igore> console.log(this) returns html: <input name="blah" value="blah">
[20:13:01] <igore> if I try this.wrap(); I get: this.wrap is not a function
[20:14:03] <Whirl3d> it works for me.
[20:14:26] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/REuyH/22/
[20:15:42] <Whirl3d> ?.placeholder
[20:15:43] <bot-t> Whirl3d, placeholder | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/placeholder
[20:16:13] <Whirl3d> drats. HTML5 has placeholder attributes for input elements that do what it appears that you are trying to do.
[20:16:52] <igore> I will check it out..
[20:17:00] <igore> Seems like the link doesn't work atm.
[20:17:24] <igore> Also, seems like there is something else wrong with my code and that the plugin works correctly.
[20:17:35] <igore> Must be something else that is causing the issue.
[20:17:38] <Whirl3d> yeah. Sux. <input type='text' placeholder='sometext'/>
[20:18:28] <Whirl3d> it'll show "sometext" in grey until focused. Then it will be blank. Then, blurred with no value, it replaces the placeholder text in HTML5 automagically.
[20:22:05] <yamahaalex> why wont this work? if($('#winMain').css('visibility', 'visible')){
[20:22:05] <yamahaalex> 			$('#winMain').css('visibility', 'hidden');
[20:22:05] <yamahaalex> 		}
[20:22:05] <yamahaalex> 		elseif($('#winMain').css('visibility', 'hidden')){
[20:22:05] <yamahaalex> 			$('#winMain').css('visibility', 'visible');
[20:22:05] <yamahaalex> 		}
[20:22:46] <yamahaalex> the first part works
[20:23:38] <Whirl3d> yamahaalex, here's the deal: if you want to SET the value of 'visibility', you would have two parameters. To simply view it, only one.
[20:24:26] <Whirl3d> if ($("#winMain").css("visibility')=='visible') { $("#winMain").css("visibility','hidden');}
[20:24:31] <Whirl3d> see the difference?\
[20:25:14] <Whirl3d> and you know the difference between visibility and (opacity/display), right?
[20:25:24] <yamahaalex> yeah i think
[20:27:18] <yamahaalex> thanks it works
[21:08:52] <tokam> hello I am trying to trigger change events on a radio buttons sharing the same name.
[21:08:55] <tokam> $('input[name=type]:checked').change( function(){ alert('changed'); } );
[21:09:06] <tokam> this is my code but it does not alert anything when I click one of the buttons
[21:10:15] <tokam> upps ' as string delim is not good. i coded too much php
[21:10:29] <tokam> or no i think it is allowed is not it?
[21:10:43] <dogarrhea2> eh. maybe not a question for here
[21:10:44] <tokam> of course it is **tired**
[21:11:15] <dogarrhea2> if i'm not using flash, what kind of functionality allows me to record microphone stuff
[21:11:54] <devnill> https://labs.ericsson.com/developer-community/blog/beyond-html5-audio-capture-web-browsers
[21:11:59] <devnill> or java
[21:12:00] <tokam> is that selector ok? I found it on stackoverflow $('input[name=type]:checked')
[21:12:14] <tokam> oh no it just selects the checked ones (sorry no sleep)
[21:12:32] <tokam> is there a trick to get more out of you without sleep?
[21:13:29] <M4d3L> hi. how I can do a .each on all inpute with name like voyageur[someI0,1,2,3...][dob][annee]
[21:23:42] <coldhead> M4d3L: $('[name^="voyageur"]').each(...)
[21:23:57] <coldhead> and you can test the name inside your function if you need to be picky
[21:28:39] <Whirl3d> how do you get rid of the default field highlight?
[21:29:41] <coldhead> input:focused {iforgetwhat:somethingaboutborder?}
[21:38:47] <heshanh> is there way to promt a Confirm box when someone change a value of a select list , and if they clikc cancle, make the select list go back to the previous value?
[21:39:31] <heshanh> im trying to do something like, is the user select '0' ask them are you sure? and if they click no, make the select value go back to whatever that was before he selected '0'
[21:41:19] <ndss56> heshanh: its possible.
[21:41:35] <heshanh> how complicated is it?
[21:41:48] <heshanh> i tried return false on cancle but that didnt do it
[21:43:15] <ndss56> heshanh: not very. you first register a mouse up event of each select option.
[21:44:06] <ndss56> heshanh: the event handler will start a confirm box.
[21:44:38] <ryanseddon> coldhead: irccloud shat itself and I can't get back into ot, did anyone else try the page?
[21:50:46] <coldhead> ryanseddon: 5,6,7 failed for vladikoff in android 4
[21:51:09] <coldhead> ryanseddon: and <vladikoff> ryanseddon, http://v14d.com/i/4ee04c0b23433.jpg
[21:52:26] <Cork> heshanh: as far as i know, this is the only way to do it http://jsfiddle.net/W7MLg/
[21:53:34] <coldhead> 'you\'re sure?'*
[21:53:47] <Cork> fine :)

[23:14:05] <amirwebdev2> is to do eval() to a results of $.ajax()  to var is safe?
[23:14:31] <devnill> I wouldn't
[23:14:32] <Cork> amirwebdev2: don't dubble post
[23:14:45] <devnill> there are better way to do stuff like eval
[23:15:03] <Cork> devnill: he's getting help in #javascript
[23:15:05] <amirwebdev2> how
[23:15:21] <devnill> window[variablename+"something"]
[23:15:47] <devnill> what do you want to do specifically?
[23:16:18] <Cork> amirwebdev2: you got a link for the answer in the other channel
[23:16:37] * Cork really hates when ppl dubble posts, it wasits so much enegry
[23:16:45] <devnill> lol
[23:17:37] <devnill> I don't even bother with #javascript. Without jquery, i would find something better to do with my time
[23:17:41] <devnill> like dart.
[23:17:47] <Cork> heh
[23:18:23] <Cork> it doesn't really matter what channel it is, but asking the same question in multible channels at the same time
[23:18:36] <amirwebdev2> maybe i should use $ajax with "script"
[23:18:40] <devnill> yeah, that is pretty rude
[23:18:43] <amirwebdev2> it will do the trick?
[23:18:45] <Cork> often means multible users put ther time into formulating an answer and to no point
[23:18:56] <devnill> can you tell me what you want to do?
[23:19:01] <devnill> I'm curious
[23:19:48] <devnill> most stuff can be done without eval() and if it can't you probably shouldn't do it in the first place
[23:19:58] <amirwebdev2> i got :
[23:19:58] <Cork> amirwebdev2: firstly pick a channel and ask there, then explain what type of response you get so we can tell whats the wbest thing to do
[23:20:26] <Cork> devnill: 99.99999% of everything you can do with eval can be done through other means
[23:20:34] <devnill> exactly.
[23:20:36] <Cork> and the last part can be done through Function('')
[23:20:49] <Cork> so eval is just none issue
[23:20:52] <devnill> i didn't see the inital contet
[23:21:11] <devnill> only time I use eval() is for early testing so I don't need to reupload a file
[23:21:32] <devnill> but that is obviously not something that makes it into a live version
[23:21:34] <Cork> i don't think i've used eval in my own code for a good 10 years
[23:22:02] <devnill> i use it all the time when I want to debug stuff. Its really handy!
[23:22:22] <devnill> but never on anything that is visible on the internet
[23:22:54] <amirwebdev2> http://pastebin.com/PhWSwMQQ
[23:23:29] <devnill> I really should learn to use the console better
[23:24:01] <amirwebdev2> see the new version i did some fix
[23:24:02] <devnill> that is a horrible pastebin
[23:24:07] <devnill> what are you trying to do?
[23:24:09] <Cork> amirwebdev2: you want type 'json'
[23:24:15] <Cork> not script
[23:24:34] <amirwebdev2> i want somehow to eval the variable country name
[23:24:41] <Cork> no you don't
[23:24:45] <Cork> you want to parse the json
[23:24:58] <Cork> you don't EVER want to eval json
[23:25:37] <devnill> why would you eval it?
[23:25:43] <devnill> what do you want to do with it?
[23:26:07] <devnill> you still haven't said what you want to do with the data
[23:26:27] <Cork> devnill: its simple json that needs to be parsed to javascript objects
[23:26:28] <amirwebdev2> i want to use it
[23:26:37] <amirwebdev2> like v.count
[23:26:56] <Cork> amirwebdev2: as said dataType: 'json'
[23:27:05] <devnill> oh geez.
[23:27:51] <Cork> amirwebdev2: if you don't get json from the success callback, your service doesn't send valid json
[23:28:40] <amirwebdev2> i can parse it otherway
[23:28:45] <amirwebdev2> i do the server side
[23:28:54] <amirwebdev2> so i should use somthing similar to
[23:29:01] <Cork> amirwebdev2: what?
[23:29:21] <Cork> amirwebdev2: dataType: 'json' should work as long as your getting valid json
[23:29:26] <amirwebdev2> http://pastebin.com/kg4zHZ4g
[23:30:02] <Cork> amirwebdev2: that doesn't explain what data you get
[23:30:31] <devnill> is that php?
[23:30:32] <amirwebdev2> i want to set a variable with the country name
[23:30:35] <Cork> yes
[23:30:56] <amirwebdev2> ajax/popup_greet_country/js?cc=BR
[23:31:10] <amirwebdev2> will return and eval
[23:31:11] <amirwebdev2> var BR = { "v": ...
[23:31:28] <Cork> uh.. wait a min
[23:31:28] <devnill> protip: json_encode() is your friend
[23:31:37] <Cork> your prob even getting valid json
[23:31:48] <Cork> you just need to access it correctly
[23:32:01] <Cork> msg[0].geo_map_info_country_shortname
[23:32:22] <Cork> i don't see any .country in there
[23:32:55] <amirwebdev2> country is cc
[23:33:06] <Cork> don't see it
[23:33:54] <Cork> anyway from the looks of things that json isn't parsable it starts with [ and ends with };
[23:34:25] <devnill> amirwebdev2: when you want to export json from php use json_encode
[23:34:27] <amirwebdev2> sec
[23:34:34] <amirwebdev2> yeah
[23:34:37] <devnill> that way you will be sure its valid
[23:34:38] <Cork> ya, for a good reason
[23:34:40] <amirwebdev2> thats what the server returns
[23:34:47] <amirwebdev2> no i just cutted some
[23:34:50] <amirwebdev2> the ...
[23:34:51] <Cork> amirwebdev2: so it needs to be fixed
[23:34:53] <amirwebdev2> cause its long
[23:35:22] <Cork> amirwebdev2: you would have to treat that response as text and regex search through it
[23:35:29] <Cork> cause its not json, just a text blob
[23:38:54] <varnie> good day.
[23:39:15] <varnie> I have the following css style: "background: url("/i/tbtc_grad1.gif") no-repeat scroll left top #EBEDD6". how can I remove that "url" from it using jQuery?
[23:39:54] <Cork> varnie: you want to modify the css rule?
[23:40:02] <Cork> or just remove the image from an element
[23:40:18] <varnie> I want to dynamically change the css rule
[23:41:09] <Cork> varnie: best solution is prob to create an overiding class
[23:41:14] <Cork> and dynamically apply that class
[23:41:29] <varnie> and why I cannot remove the url from that css by the way?
[23:41:31] <Cork> editing rules is complicated, and not something jquery will help you with
[23:41:42] <Cork> varnie: you can
[23:41:55] <Cork> but you need to go to document.styleSheets
[23:42:02] <Cork> loop over the array of linked sheets
[23:42:08] <Cork> then loop over the rule filters
[23:42:14] <Cork> then update the correct value
[23:42:24] <varnie> but there is css() method
[23:42:25] <Cork> just adding a new class is much faster
[23:42:39] <Cork> thats for that specific element
[23:42:39] <Cork> not the rule
[23:42:49] <Cork> it adds an inline overide for the element
[23:42:52] <varnie> why we cannot just put "$(.myItem).css('background', 'none  no-repeat scroll left top #EBEDD6'); ?
[23:43:06] <Cork> you can, but it will not affect the rule
[23:43:07] <varnie> hmm, okay, I didn't know that
[23:43:10] <Cork> only the element
[23:59:42] <lyrae> Hi. I clone an element that has the attribute num="1"  (kinda like id=1)...after i clone, i try to .attr('num', 2). but it doesnt work. why?
