[00:03:28] <raj> I have a checkbox that may/not be checked on page load. Accordingly, I want to set .on or .off an event listener on a second element. Additionally, I want to put .on or .off the eventlistener on the second element if the checkbox changes. Is there a way I can do this cleanly, such as setting $('#mycheckbox').on('load change', ...)? (i'm aware there is no `load` event for checkboxes) Or is triggering a .change() on the checkbox within $(function(){}) the ...
[00:03:34] <raj> ... best I can do?
[00:03:59] <raj> My main goal is to not repeat myself
[00:04:28] <raj> and handle the checkbox stuff within a single handler if possible
[00:05:02] <mogaj> Cork : i used your code but gettinhg this error 'Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'sort''
[00:05:16] <Cork> mogaj: ugg
[00:05:33] <Cork> right that's an object not an array...
[00:05:47] <Cork> mogaj: so back to looping and building a new object then
[00:06:04] <Cork> mogaj: unless you can modify the server code to send an array instead of an object for the listing
[00:06:29] <mogaj> Cork : Okay thankyou
[00:12:10] <DavidH> I have a question regarding the scope of $(this), can someone take a look and tell me if what I am trying to do is possible
[00:12:12] <DavidH> http://pastebin.com/RV9Q2V6A
[00:13:09] <coRz> DavidH, define this as that : var that = this
[00:13:21] <coRz> where the on click starts
[00:13:50] <Cork> Davey: $(this) is just this passed to a function $
[00:14:09] <Cork> Davey: this has the same name scope as it always has in javascript
[00:14:13] <Cork> local to the function
[00:14:28] <Cork> this is redefined everytime a function is called
[00:14:53] <Cork> also i recommend not using "that" as a variable name
[00:15:03] <Cork> it is too easy to miss read
[00:15:55] <DavidH> perfect, thanks!
[00:16:15] <Cork> Davey: so this is what i would recommend http://pastebin.com/xUfcvDpB
[00:37:14] <Laura87> hello!
[00:37:28] <Jacta> hi!
[00:42:08] <Laura87> I was wondering if there is any affordable and flexible jQuery + MySQL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) framework ?
[00:42:31] <Laura87> I am currently trying JqGrid (JqSuite) and seems interesting
[00:42:41] <Laura87> I was wondering if there's anything better
[01:01:16] <mrksjs> does anybody here know how its possible to pre-format cells with tablesorter before the format function is being called?
[01:05:46] <BrazenBraden> Laura87: you looked at Ember? (perhaps not understanding your requirements)
[01:17:39] <lite_> is it possible to set up a watcher of some kind on an element with a callback if the element gets a class added ?
[01:21:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> lite_: you mean .hasClass ?
[01:21:27] <willisis> @lite_ you might try http://meetselva.github.io/attrchange/
[01:21:39] <lite_> yeha but the class is dynamically applied
[01:21:47] <Cork> lite_: no there isn't
[01:21:54] <Cork> there is no events from dom modifications
[01:22:23] <Cork> in really new browsers you can use mutation observers
[01:22:34] <Cork> but it isn't very well supported yet
[01:22:40] <Cork> ?mdn mutationobserver
[01:22:41] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Mozilla Developer Center â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[01:23:52] <vince164> hey has anyone used pagedown?
[01:25:16] <willisis> @lite_ or your might try this one: https://github.com/darcyclarke/jQuery-Watch-Plugin
[01:26:58] <willisis> otherwise, you can poll with a setTimeout. like: function isItChanged(){ if (//check it){ //do stuff } else {setTimeout(isItChanged, 400)}
[01:27:09] <Cork> pulling with timers is a bad idea
[01:28:02] <Cork> it's normally better to just have the function changing the class call a function to tell you it has been changed
[01:28:18] <Cork> or have a function to change the class and to it that way instead
[01:32:52] <willisis> Agreed. That watch plugin uses mutation observers and falls back propertychange for IE and to polling for other older browsers
[01:38:19] <vince164> how can i write multiple text lines to a div
[01:38:56] <Cork> ?api append
[01:38:56] <b-ot> Cork: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[01:38:58] <vince164> i tried document.write  but when i had a second like it give me a syntax error
[01:39:07] <vince164> ok let me trythat
[01:39:09] <Cork> don't ever use document.write
[01:39:13] <Cork> EVER
[01:40:56] <vince164> no i still get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[01:41:16] <vince164> im trying to conver my markdown code from the my database to html
[01:41:25] <vince164> convert*
[01:43:28] <Cork> vince164: sounds like you have invalid characters in your strings
[01:49:42] <lemonsparrow> neither $('#status').attr('selectedIndex', '2'); nor $('#status').prop('selectedIndex', '2'); is working option tag value selected isn't changing ... any other way ?
[01:50:26] <Cork> $('#status').val(2) ?
[01:50:26] <iwantoski> lemonsparrow: What element is #status?
[01:51:05] <Cork> or is it a multi-select?
[01:51:08] <lemonsparrow> <select id="select" class="status"> <option value="7">7 Days</option> <option value="14">14 Days</option> <option value="30">30 Days</option> <option value="60">60 Days</option> <option value="90">90 Days</option> </select>
[01:51:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: iwantoski ^^
[01:51:22] <Cork> ya, you want .val()
[01:51:26] <iwantoski> ^
[01:51:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thats based on the value but why isnt it working based on index ?
[01:52:02] <lemonsparrow> 0 = 7, 1 = 14 that ways
[01:52:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork: iwantoski
[01:53:28] <lemonsparrow> Cork: even $('#status').val('selectedIndex', 30); doesn't work
[01:53:29] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/T96AM/
[01:53:30] <iwantoski> $('#status').selectedIndex
[01:53:31] <Cork> works fine here
[01:53:37] <Cork> iwantoski: no
[01:53:57] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the id you use is not the same as the one you used in the html
[01:54:22] <Cork> lemonsparrow: val is for setting based on value on the option
[01:54:29] <iwantoski> I'm sorry, I just woke up
[01:54:35] <iwantoski> I'll be quiet from now on
[01:55:10] <Cork> lemonsparrow: might it be you intended to use the class and not the id?
[01:55:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yeah.. sorry... got it thanks
[01:58:22] <dwarder> when i return part of the object from a function and assing this parth to var, will changng this var affect the primordial object
[01:58:42] <Cork> dwarder: possibly
[01:58:48] <Cork> depends on what the part is
[01:59:14] <dwarder> Cork: anyway i should use _clone ?
[01:59:33] <Cork> $.extend(true, {}, org)
[01:59:45] <dwarder> _(object.part).clone()
[01:59:46] <Cork> it will return a duplicate
[01:59:48] <Cork> no
[01:59:49] <Cork> ah
[01:59:53] <Cork> underscore
[01:59:54] <Cork> donno
[02:00:21] <Cork> dwarder: that needs to happen at the base is you need to loop the objects and make copies of them
[02:00:42] <Cork> if underscores clone does that, then yes that works
[02:00:48] <dwarder> thank you
[02:01:43] <Cork> dwarder: but to answer the question, var org = { a:'', b: { c: 1 } };
[02:01:57] <Cork> a and b.c is safe to reference from somewhere else
[02:01:59] <Cork> b isn't
[02:02:55] <Cork> js> var org = { a:'', b: { c: 1 } }, copy = org.b; copy.c = 20; print(JSON.stringify(org));
[02:02:59] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:03:10] <Cork> man that bot sucks...
[02:03:37] <Cork> '{"a":"","b":{"c":20}}'
[02:10:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how can I get this done
[02:10:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I want to to 2 lines here but some how gives error http://pastebin.com/0rCr6ckt
[02:11:30] <Cork> whats the error?
[02:13:58] <coRz> lemon, im not sure attr returns the object itself
[02:14:09] <coRz> try  $select.on(...)
[02:14:17] <Cork> it does
[02:14:30] <coRz> what is the error
[02:14:31] <Cork> when you set a value that is
[02:16:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: wrks fine but instead of numberOfDays = this.selectedIndex; I want the value of the selected option tag how to get that ?
[02:16:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this.selectedIndex returns only the index
[02:16:38] <Cork> $(this).val()
[02:16:52] <coRz> looool
[02:18:40] <lemonsparrow> coRz: http://pastebin.com/0rCr6ckt
[02:19:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://pastebin.com/0rCr6ckt second line not getting invoked
[02:19:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what is abcd?
[02:21:26] <lemonsparrow> abcd = {}; and abcd.display() is a function
[02:21:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: create a fiddle if you need help with it
[02:22:12] <Cork> dead code isn't possible to debug
[02:22:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hey it worked.. :) was a simple silly syntax issue :)
[02:36:48] <fabioportieri> hi, does anyone has experience in jquery+SVG elements? all i have to do i select a <g> element, i tried putting an id attribute into it but no luck...
[02:37:06] <Cork> should work fine
[02:37:30] <fabioportieri> not really because svg dom != html dom
[02:37:52] <Cork> is the svg inline or in an iframe or something?
[02:37:59] <Cork> cause if it is inline; it is
[02:38:38] <fabioportieri> it's online
[02:38:41] <fabioportieri> inline
[02:39:03] <fabioportieri> but my click isn't triggered, tried with setting both id="" and class="" to <g>
[02:39:58] <dwarder> i have a handle function .on('click','li', function(event){code goes here; another code; return false; why this code still runs?});
[02:40:46] <dwarder> is there a way to preven execution of a code after a certain code? return false doesn't work for handlers?
[02:40:53] <Cork> fabioportieri: http://jsfiddle.net/7MnXk/
[02:41:47] <Cork> dwarder: nothing runs after return;
[02:41:48] <Cork> ever
[02:41:56] <Cork> if it does, then you arn't running the return value
[02:42:08] <Cork> *running the return command
[02:42:34] <dwarder> Cork: ohh right
[02:42:53] <dwarder> Cork: i need to put my code a little more upper
[02:43:20] <fabioportieri> Cork: nice, but what if i have a <g> to tag instead of a <path> ?
[02:43:36] <Cork> doesn't matter
[02:43:46] <Cork> it's just dom
[02:44:21] <Cork> fabioportieri: http://jsfiddle.net/7MnXk/1/
[02:46:37] <fabioportieri> yeah i tested , it should work
[02:46:51] <fabioportieri> so my problem is elsewhere.. thanks
[02:47:17] <Cork> fabioportieri: make sure you don't have id collision for example
[02:47:35] <Cork> $(selector).length should help there
[02:48:57] <fabioportieri> Cork: for some reason selector.length == 0
[02:49:56] <Cork> fabioportieri: so you might be running the selector before the element exist
[02:50:32] <fabioportieri> Cork: i thought of it i'm using .on("click",,,,
[02:50:43] <Cork> fabioportieri: that doesn't matter
[02:50:54] <fabioportieri> on document.ready..?
[02:50:55] <Cork> if you mean you use delegated it would
[02:51:04] <Cork> is the svg loaded on page load?
[02:51:09] <Cork> or is it loaded later?
[02:51:16] <fabioportieri> uhmm
[02:51:24] <fabioportieri> it's loaded later :p
[02:51:32] <fabioportieri> ehe
[02:51:32] <Cork> then you need to use delegated event listener
[02:51:53] <Cork> read http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:52:21] <fabioportieri> i moved the code now it works
[02:52:24] <fabioportieri> thanks very much
[02:52:27] <Cork> np
[03:07:36] <doev> I need for $.ajax | success-callback an additional parameter. How can I do that?
[03:08:28] <Cork> doev: you could scope a variable, or you could use context in ajax
[03:10:09] <doev> Cork, scope means make it global?
[03:10:39] <Cork> well it makes it in the same scope, but no it wasn't what i meant
[03:10:53] <Cork> if you define a variable in the function where you call $.ajax
[03:11:16] <Cork> the callback you give for the callback can access it too
[03:11:24] <Cork> if it is an inline function that is
[03:13:55] <fabioportieri> out of curiosity any of you use angularJs or backbone if so what's your opinion about it
[03:15:39] <doev> Cork, the variable is a parameter of the function that calls $.ajax, but the success function can't access it.
[03:15:54] <Cork> doev: fiddle please
[03:34:53] <glambert> is there a way of finding elements that contain text matching a regex?
[03:35:05] <glambert> rather than .text().match() as that just gets the text
[03:35:10] <glambert> whereas I want the element
[03:35:15] <Cork> no
[03:35:22] <Cork> css doesn't support matching content
[03:35:42] <glambert> css?
[03:35:51] <Cork> $('css selectors')
[03:35:58] <glambert> ok
[03:36:01] <Pedroshow> can someone help me with popup issue? my page is showing a popup without any trigger to do that!
[03:36:38] <Cork> glambert: the best option is normally to set classes on the elements and use that
[03:36:58] <glambert> Cork, yeah not an option my case unfortunately
[03:37:07] <glambert> it's for a browser plugin
[03:37:28] <Cork> ya, then looping and checking the content is the only optoon
[03:37:32] <Cork> *option
[03:40:14] <glambert> I'll write a jQuery extension to do it
[03:40:39] <Cork> glambert: where is already the filter function
[03:41:12] <Cork> $('selector').filter(function() { return $(this).text().match() }).addClass() /* or what ever */
[03:43:41] <doev> Cork, I am new with fiddler: http://jsfiddle.net/RGAy5/
[03:44:19] <Cork> doev: the function is in a different scope so the variable isn't accessable
[03:44:43] <doev> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/RGAy5/2/
[03:45:57] <Cork> doev: http://jsfiddle.net/RGAy5/4/
[03:57:37] <doev> Cork, thx that is working now. I have to learn to understand ;)
[04:08:48] <iaj> Is there a jquery way to bind to an event after an submit that is executed? After the validator from tools didn't throw any errors?
[04:14:19] <seutje> iaj: if ur using jquery validate, you can pass a submitHanlder callback, do ur stuff in there and  finish by calling submit() on the only argument passed into the callback
[04:14:52] <seutje> like $('form').validate({submitHandler: function(form) { doSomeShit(); form.submit(); }});
[04:15:01] <pedrommone> can someone help me with popup issue? my page is showing a popup without any trigger to do that!
[04:15:02] <seutje> note that form is a DOM element, not a jQuery collection
[04:15:16] <seutje> so calling submit on it will trigger the native submit and not the handler bound by jQuery
[04:15:32] <seutje> pedrommone: got demo?
[04:16:55] <pedrommone> seutje, http://perolasdoface.com/4-pre-sal-anal
[04:17:30] <seutje> where's the popup?
[04:18:03] <pedrommone> it triggers here
[04:18:09] <pedrommone> I dont know where it comes from lol
[04:18:18] <seutje> not seeing any popups pop... up

[04:20:37] <seutje> ah, like a real popup, I was looking for a modal overlay, my bad :P
[04:21:28] <pedrommone> seutje, yea, it should not pop up lol
[04:21:30] <seutje> pedrommone: window.open(post, null, "height=" + height + ",width=" + width + ",status=yes,toolbar=no,menubar=no,location=no");
[04:21:33] <sdwrage> Hey all, having trouble with when I hover over an a tag I can't seem to select the header h2 above it to do some styling: http://jsfiddle.net/ZW87w/1/
[04:21:35] <seutje> in the share function
[04:21:49] <sdwrage> right now I just have testing in there but that alert returns undefined
[04:21:51] <pedrommone> but it cannot trigger lol
[04:22:05] <pedrommone> since it can only be trigger with the buttons
[04:23:30] <seutje> pedrommone: all those function names are globals, so I wouldn't be surprised if something conflicted
[04:23:54] <pedrommone> ahh, I just need change the name then? o.o
[04:24:56] <pedrommone> seutje, changed to socialShare and keeps displaying
[04:26:27] <seutje> how about not making it a gloval?
[04:26:29] <seutje> global
[04:26:42] <seutje> looks like whatever calls it also overrides it afterwards o.O
[04:26:59] <seutje> window.share is undefined after the dust settles
[04:27:05] <seutje> but still exists
[04:27:34] <pedrommone> seutje, how I can make it unglobal and call with onClick="function():"?
[04:28:05] <seutje> oh boy
[04:28:15] <seutje> don't use onClick
[04:28:25] <seutje> `api on
[04:28:25] <b-ot> seutje: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:30:12] <pedrommone> look my code, what you suggest me to improve?
[04:35:33] <sdwrage> Is there a way to get an a tags hover color?
[04:35:37] <seutje> pedrommone: don't use global, use proper event handlers, move the facebook rubbish out of ur doc.rdy, don't do an ajax request upon receiving the response for another ajax request, concat the result of the second call into the first, put you script in a separate file so debugging it isn't a huge PITA, don't use selectors with both an ID and an attribute selector
[04:36:48] <sdwrage> nvm got it
[04:37:54] <pedrommone> ok, thanks
[04:38:14] <pedrommone> gonna work here

[04:51:49] <seutje> like $('body').on('click', 'a.open-in-popup', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); window.open(this.href); });
[04:51:55] <pedrommone> ok
[04:52:37] <pedrommone> cool. now is working like a charm :)

[05:47:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> dinho: this is not #php
[05:47:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> its #jquery
[05:48:12] <dinho> I can not do one FOR  working in php5I would switch to jquery
[05:48:32] <dinho> like to do this is in jquery
[05:49:00] <dinho> it is possible to convert php form in jquery
[05:50:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/7933628160/h2EDEF3E9/
[05:51:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> dinho: your basically creating vars dynamically and setting them to existing vars?
[05:52:35] <dinho> I would do this in jquery FOR, is possible?
[05:53:50] <dinho> I can not do php stop generating errors. the application works. but generates errors.
[05:53:51] <dinho> just need that this is no longer generates these errors
[05:54:20] <dinho> so I would do in jquery. but do not know if it is possible
[05:54:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> jquery for?
[05:54:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> as in jquery for loop?
[05:55:05] <dinho> is
[05:55:07] <dinho> yes
[05:55:39] <dinho> if I switch to jquery may end with errors in php
[05:55:51] <dinho> in php http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/code/251927ee2d8849a7656e0e660d39ffab2c9664de
[05:57:01] <dinho> the room is closed php
[05:58:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> well to directly convert your stuff
[05:58:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> in jquery
[05:58:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> varabiles are var foo = "bar"
[05:58:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont think
[05:58:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> but dont take my word for this
[05:59:11] <dinho> ok
[05:59:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont think there is a way to autogenerate vars
[05:59:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> consider using array perhaps?
[05:59:32] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui i think i have the positioning right :O
[05:59:35] <grafi> im amazed
[05:59:36] <grafi> xD
[05:59:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: positioning for what?
[05:59:54] <grafi> for the icon thingie
[06:00:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> bro
[06:00:07] <grafi> now on to the tranforms
[06:00:09] <grafi> <:
[06:00:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> its not centered anymore
[06:00:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> check io link
[06:00:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> /
[06:00:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[06:00:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> it was always centered
[06:00:51] <grafi> in some crazy way
[06:00:54] <grafi> :P
[06:02:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[06:02:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> what did you do graif?
[06:05:26] <grafi> fixed it
[06:05:28] <grafi> pah!
[06:05:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> fixed what?
[06:05:39] <grafi> bro
[06:05:42] <grafi> do you even lift
[06:05:51] <grafi> i removed the keyframey stuff
[06:05:56] <grafi> and it still works
[06:06:00] <grafi> like we wanted
[06:06:02] <grafi> booyah
[06:06:45] <grafi> now im doing the checkboxes, and then DRY it up a bit
[06:06:50] <grafi> btw
[06:07:03] <grafi> have you installed sass and stuff?
[06:07:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope
[06:07:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> sass will work without me installing right
[06:07:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is for regular users
[06:08:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: how you got transition stuff to work I will nevner know
[06:09:01] <grafi> because im being extemely clever
[06:09:03] <grafi> :P
[06:09:12] <grafi> to quote my favourite doctor
[06:09:13] <grafi> <:
[06:09:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> oaky can you pushchanges to master
[06:09:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> when finished with checkboxes
[06:13:29] <glambert> am I misinterpreting :nth-of-type() to mean something else?  I'm trying to write a function to get a unique "handle" or whatever you want to call it for an element
[06:13:37] <glambert> div:nth-of-type(2) div:nth-of-type(1) ul:nth-of-type(2) li:nth-of-type(1) ul:nth-of-type(2) li:nth-of-type(7)
[06:13:39] <glambert> for example
[06:14:06] <glambert> but div:nth-of-type(2) div:nth-of-type(1) ul:nth-of-type(2) returns nothing, whereas if you change the UL index to 1 it returns 3 elements
[06:21:14] <Cork> glambert: not sure what definition you've read, but https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type explains it quite well
[06:21:46] <glambert> Cork, the one on the jQuery website
[06:21:52] <glambert> will read your link now
[06:23:28] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui why did you change things :O
[06:23:35] <grafi> now i have merge conflicts :D
[06:23:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry bro had some changes not synced
[06:23:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> forgot to mention to you
[06:23:53] <grafi> you animal :D
[06:23:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> but you said
[06:23:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats the good part about git
[06:24:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[06:24:06] <grafi> it is
[06:24:09] <glambert> Cork, that's different to http://api.jquery.com/nth-of-type-selector
[06:24:54] <Cork> glambert: it is a bit more tecnical, but it is the same
[06:25:01] <Cork> *technical
[06:25:07] <raj> Rohan_Bhangui, nice frontend
[06:25:22] <raj> didn't mean to oggle
[06:25:35] <glambert> ul:nth-of-type(1) is returning five results though for me, not one
[06:25:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj:  no problem bro, on the contrary if you want to contribute, the project is open
[06:26:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> you are free to add what you like make a request
[06:26:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> its meant as a fast flat design prototyper
[06:26:11] <glambert> same as if I just enter ul with no :nth-of-type
[06:26:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: ^^
[06:27:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: the plan in my mind now, is to get as many of the members fo #jquery to be in on it, so that we can make a tool developed for the community by the community
[06:29:56] <raj> not sure my design skills are up to par
[06:29:59] <jqueryuser11> hello there!
[06:30:07] <raj> you've clearly been doing this for a while :)
[06:30:23] <jqueryuser11> we have a problem overriding a linear-gradien with another one using jquery addClass
[06:30:26] <jqueryuser11> is it a bug?
[06:30:38] <Cork> jqueryuser11: no
[06:30:55] <Cork> if you can't override it with a class it has VERY little to do with jquery
[06:31:07] <Cork> 1. make sure you actually add the class to the target element
[06:31:22] <Cork> 2. inspect what rule wins on the element
[06:31:23] <jqueryuser11> it works for all inputs expet from type text..
[06:31:28] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui text-align center on the body was not a good idea xD
[06:31:30] <jqueryuser11> here is the fiddle
[06:31:31] <jqueryuser11> http://jsfiddle.net/nT75E/2/
[06:31:34] <Cork> 3. fix the css structure to get the correct one to win
[06:31:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:31:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> i figured youd catch that sooner or later
[06:31:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[06:32:06] <grafi> sadly not before commiting it xD
[06:32:27] <Cork> jqueryuser11: an id is more specific then a class
[06:32:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:32:36] <Cork> jqueryuser11: so the rule from the id will always win
[06:32:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: any help we can get visual or even like behind the scenes are appreciated
[06:33:12] <grafi> much better
[06:33:31] <jqueryuser11> Cork doesnt matter
[06:33:31] <jqueryuser11> http://jsfiddle.net/nT75E/3/
[06:34:17] <Cork> jqueryuser11: also images is above background-color
[06:34:32] <raj> Rohan_Bhangui, when I check/uncheck the checkbox, it seems to fade. How in the world are you doing that with css?
[06:34:44] <Cork> jqueryuser11: http://jsfiddle.net/nT75E/4/
[06:34:46] <grafi> xD
[06:34:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> animation-direction: reverse
[06:34:54] <grafi> not anymore
[06:34:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[06:34:57] <grafi> *cough*
[06:34:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:35:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> well wha you can do
[06:35:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> is set the off style in the :not(:checked) selctor
[06:35:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> or the label:before
[06:35:27] <jqueryuser11> Cork can pls resend the link
[06:35:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> selctor
[06:35:35] <Cork> jqueryuser11: http://jsfiddle.net/nT75E/4/
[06:35:36] <grafi> soooo
[06:35:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^ that will set it by default
[06:35:41] <grafi> ima sassify now
[06:35:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> alrighty
[06:35:49] <grafi> no more commits until thats done!
[06:35:54] <grafi> or ill come and get you
[06:35:55] <grafi> :D
[06:35:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:35:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[06:36:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: the fade is done using animation-direction:reverse
[06:36:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: but that has changed
[06:36:45] <grafi> so you're lying
[06:36:46] <grafi> :D
[06:36:51] <raj> yep, not in the css
[06:37:03] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui do we need all those font stuff oÃ´
[06:37:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> well not all
[06:37:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> only the necessary ones
[06:37:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> which i bleive is helvetica neue
[06:37:21] <grafi> which are
[06:37:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> and monsterrrat
[06:37:29] <grafi> and fontawesome
[06:37:29] <grafi> ^^
[06:37:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> *montserrat
[06:37:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[06:37:51] <grafi> okidokes
[06:38:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:38:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> you sohuld see the font folder
[06:38:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> lots of fonts i tested
[06:38:44] <grafi> hm
[06:38:53] <grafi> naming the variables will be hard
[06:38:54] <grafi> xD
[06:39:00] <grafi> color1 color2 color4
[06:39:01] <grafi> :D
[06:39:50] <grafi> the good thing is, sass has iteration
[06:39:59] <grafi> so the stylesheet will look a lot shorter
[06:40:00] <grafi> :p
[06:44:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: use color names
[06:44:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> like blue red green
[06:44:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> etc
[06:44:57] <grafi> thats shitty though
[06:44:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> red1 red2
[06:45:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> well only way to go about it
[06:45:46] <grafi> what if blue at some point changes to red
[06:45:59] <grafi> are you going to rename the variables everywhere? ^^
[06:46:20] <grafi> ill figure it out
[06:46:23] <grafi> no worries
[06:46:23] <grafi> :P
[06:46:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[06:46:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsut let me know what you change them too
[06:46:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> although you could label them according to what buttons ay
[06:46:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> *say
[06:47:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[06:47:25] <grafi> yeah, for the buttons its rather straight forward
[06:47:33] <grafi> for the general stuff, not so much ^^
[06:50:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[06:52:01] <webstenno> good day, is there a convenient way to get the _new_ value of an input field on the 'keydown' event? the keydown event gives me enough information to reconstruct the exact value (read out e.which, check if shift is pressed etc.), but it seems very inconvenient. on stackoverflow, i found a workaround which uses setTimeout of 1 millisecond to read out the new value, but it seems dirty too
[06:52:13] <Cork> webstenno: no
[06:52:20] <webstenno> dammit
[06:52:22] <webstenno> thanks
[06:52:30] <Cork> cause the value isn't in the input field yet
[06:52:35] <webstenno> yeah right
[06:52:41] <Cork> webstenno: you might want to check the input event instead
[06:52:43] <webstenno> that is what the setTimeout kludge-works around
[06:52:53] <webstenno> input event? will do that, thanks!
[06:53:01] <Cork> ?mdn input event
[06:53:02] <b-ot> Cork: input - Web technology reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/input
[06:53:06] <webstenno> thanks :)
[06:55:49] <webstenno> Cork: worked just as expected - thats clean and nice! thanks a lot
[06:56:11] <Cork> webstenno: one warning, input doesn't work on select elements
[06:56:21] <webstenno> ok, thats no problem though.
[06:56:23] <Cork> just keep that in mind :)
[06:56:27] <webstenno> noted though :)
[06:56:27] <webstenno> yes
[07:05:51] <lemonsparrow_> hi in my application I am using apache as web server to server static contents. The issue I am facing now is that any static contents in any folder other that assets/ is not available (not loading) in the html when the user is not signed in.. when he is signed in the files are available.. when I tried moving these files into assets/ folder the files became available.. why is it so ?
[07:06:20] <webstenno> lemonsparrow_: don't you think that is a problem with apache
[07:06:45] <Cork> ya, sounds like a webserver problem; => wrong channel
[07:07:05] <lemonsparrow_> webstenno: yes I know but most of jquery and js are also deployed into apache webserver.. so someone here might have faced that issue too...
[07:07:30] <webstenno> lemonsparrow_: join #httpd and ask for help there
[07:08:43] <lemonsparrow> weidou: ok
[07:08:52] <chao> :P
[07:08:56] <chao> nickchange, sorry
[07:08:58] <limpc> hmm how do you attach a menu to a rotated object so that the menu doesnt rotate with the object (using css3 transforms)?
[07:09:05] <chao> lol
[07:09:29] <Cork> limpc: you would have to transform that element backwards, or make sure it isn't a child
[07:09:53] <limpc> is there a jquery lib that lets you build a single menu and apply it to multiple objects?
[07:10:07] <limpc> I have been googling for one but havent found one yet
[07:10:41] <chao> what about using bootstrap with jquery?
[07:11:03] <limpc> i dont want to introduce more libraries, i have enough bugs to fix :P
[07:11:23] <chao> limpc: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/
[07:11:25] <chao> ah, i see
[07:12:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> how goes it grafi
[07:12:25] <grafi> its going
[07:12:26] <grafi> oÃ´

[07:13:49] <jayayseakay> 	 Hello :) can anyone have a quick look at :http://jsfiddle.net/ZMcwX/ I want the @keyframes part and #habit1 to use percentages but cant for the life of me get it to work... Im thinking it could be something to do with the jQuery?
[07:38:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: nice
[07:49:53] <raj> is it unreasonable to have an ajax request for a click event once a second?
[07:50:06] <raj> because the user may do it as fast as once a second
[07:51:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> ra
[07:52:20] <Rohan_Bhangui>  i would see how much time between last click and when you want to do ajax request
[07:52:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj:  ^
[07:55:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i like how the checkboxes and radio buttons fde in
[07:55:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> from the corners
[07:55:55] <grafi> me too
[07:55:55] <grafi> :P
[07:56:25] <TViernion> for best practice... where is the standard place in a document to put the js code?  bottom of body or bottom of script?
[07:56:37] <TViernion> s/script?/page?
[08:00:44] <willisis> TViernion: body
[08:01:37] <willisis> TViernion: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3037725/is-it-wrong-to-place-the-script-tag-after-the-body-tag
[08:02:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: how you did it i will never know
[08:02:36] <grafi> just look at the source man ^^
[08:02:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> i am
[08:02:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> looks almost the same as i did
[08:02:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> when i tried transisitons that is
[08:02:55] <grafi> just different :P
[08:03:00] <grafi> mwahaha
[08:03:00] <grafi> :D
[08:03:29] <TViernion> thanks willisis .. how about the $(document).ready snipits?
[08:03:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you cheater >:)
[08:03:44] <Cork> TViernion: only use it if you put your scripts in head
[08:03:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> you used ::after
[08:03:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> no fair XD
[08:03:55] <Cork> ie will break if you use ready at the end of body
[08:04:13] <TViernion> okay.. so put the ready at the end.. but the script in header?
[08:04:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: radio buttons look like shit in ie
[08:07:23] <willisis> TViernion: you can include jquery and then include your external script-blah.js with a $(document).ready() call in it safely.
[08:07:35] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui not for me :O
[08:07:44] <willisis> (at the end of the body)
[08:07:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> can you up the border or something im running ie11
[08:08:13] <grafi> make a screenshot :o
[08:12:58] <effortDee> hi i've set up a simple pop up box which .toggle the diplay: none on and off to :block; BUT just in firefox if i highlight the a link which fires the pop up and then move away and back on, the pop up comes up without me clicking, im guessing because i highlighted it but the fade in the background (transparent lightbox effect) doesnt fire, but then i close the pop up and then fade then fires when it should be turning off
[08:14:18] <effortDee> brb need a poo
[08:16:35] <Alina-malina> Is it possible to see what ports are currently open on client side with jquery?
[08:17:49] <diegoviola> hi
[08:18:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: http://snag.gy/s43aP.jpg
[08:18:54] <grafi> looks kind of similar to all the the other browsers? ^^
[08:19:16] <grafi> what exactly are we talking about?
[08:19:54] <diegoviola> i need to add some code to my html so that when i click on a <select> option i add another <input> element dynamically, how can i do this please?
[08:20:11] <diegoviola> and when i lose focus on that option element i remove the input
[08:27:16] <airdem> theres no way to upload a file via the <input type="file"> element + jquery.load(), right?
[08:29:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: see the border the antialiasing on the radio button is bad
[08:29:31] <Cork> airdem: load is a get request, so no
[08:29:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> on the checkboxes a line appears
[08:30:21] <Cork> airdem: you would hit the max url length before you could push any data in there
[08:30:39] <Alina-malina> Is it possible to see what ports are currently open on client side with jquery?
[08:30:52] <Cork> Alina-malina: no
[08:31:04] <Cork> Alina-malina: that would be a security problem if you could
[08:31:12] <airdem> Cork, i see but with $.ajax() sending data via form.serializeArray() would work?
[08:31:30] <Cork> airdem: no serialize can't handle file data
[08:31:37] <Cork> you need to use the formData object
[08:31:41] <Cork> ?mdn formData
[08:31:42] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[08:32:18] <airdem> will this method also return the resulting page like .load() ?
[08:32:38] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui hm i think i know how to fix that ^^
[08:32:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[08:34:04] <airdem> Cork, or will it just send the data and thats it?
[08:34:34] <airdem> because i still would like to use my already built php validation :)
[08:35:07] <Cork> airdem: what you get in the done/success callback depends on the server
[08:35:41] <Cork> airdem: but yes both get and post requests gets response data from the server
[08:35:47] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui or not, i tried to temove the border and increase the size by 1px
[08:35:52] <airdem> Cork, ahh so i use FormData + $.ajax(), right?
[08:36:05] <grafi> it fixes the look, but now it jumps in the transition ^^
[08:36:12] <Cork> airdem: you use FormData to build the value you give you data:
[08:36:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: its also happneing to the checkboxes
[08:36:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> so maybe start there
[08:36:29] <grafi> na
[08:36:33] <grafi> i think
[08:36:33] <airdem> Cork, okay im looking into it now, thanks a lot
[08:36:41] <grafi> i should stop using transition all
[08:36:49] <grafi> that could fix it
[08:36:52] <grafi> let me check
[08:36:53] <grafi> :P
[08:37:57] <airdem> Cork, var file = new FormData($(this).closest('form')[0]); so i just have to give "file" as POST data to $.ajax() ?
[08:38:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol and so once again
[08:38:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> keyframes triumphs :)
[08:38:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[08:38:23] <grafi> nana
[08:38:26] <grafi> i almost got it
[08:38:27] <grafi> :)
[08:38:42] <grafi> it doesnt jump anymore
[08:39:04] <grafi> but of course without the border the boxes are still getting smaller
[08:39:11] <grafi> or at least looking smaller
[08:39:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[08:40:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> noooooooooooooooo
[08:40:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[08:40:32] <diegoviola> i'm trying to add a new input element when i change the option from my select to a specific value, any ideas how to go in doing this?
[08:42:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> diegoviola: say you have a div where your inputs are added
[08:42:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can use .append to append html to that div
[08:42:36] <Cork> airdem: yes
[08:42:39] <diegoviola> Rohan_Bhangui: right
[08:42:56] <diegoviola> thanks
[08:43:20] <airdem> Cork, sorry for bothering but could you check if i got the idea right? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7808860
[08:44:09] <airdem> Cork, i messed up serializeArray
[08:44:14] <Cork> airdem: line 3 and 5 is wrong
[08:44:23] <airdem> should be form.serializeArray();
[08:44:40] <Cork> airdem: FormData is all you give you ajax
[08:44:55] <airdem> Cork, it contains all other fields too?
[08:45:08] <Cork> airdem: yes, and you can append extra data to it if you like
[08:45:29] <airdem> Cork, yeah i saw that in the examples. thanks man
[08:45:35] <Cork> airdem: but FormData replaces serialize
[08:45:41] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui fixed it i think :P
[08:45:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay let me chek gh-pages
[08:45:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> upload changes
[08:47:58] <grafi> im in the middle of the whole sass ordeal ^^
[08:49:46] <Tim__> Any one can help with jquery postit notes?
[08:51:12] <airdem> Cork, getting an error and on line 6 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7808992
[08:51:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: okay
[08:51:48] <grafi> doing the input stuff now
[08:51:54] <grafi> so ill hopefully be done soon
[08:52:53] <airdem> Cork, do i have to $(data) ?? :)
[08:53:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[08:53:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[08:53:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> if i need to write sass i can
[08:53:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> but to creat a file from scratch i need to install right?
[08:53:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[08:54:22] <grafi> you definetely need sass to compile down to css
[08:54:23] <grafi> ^^
[08:55:33] <test846> I have a nivo slider and fancyBox that doesn't play well togheter. How do I fix this?
[08:55:35] <paulvd> how can i give a minus value to this ".css({'marginLeft' : jQuery('#home-text').width()/2});"
[08:55:47] <paulvd> like margin-left: -value
[08:56:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: then how do users use it
[08:56:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> what i mean to say I should be able to edit
[08:57:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> or am I blocked from that until I install sass
[08:57:17] <grafi> what?
[08:57:31] <grafi> you can edit
[08:57:33] <grafi> create
[08:57:36] <grafi> whatever
[08:57:42] <grafi> but in order to compile
[08:57:47] <grafi> you need to have sass installed
[08:57:48] <Tim__> Where to get newbie help?
[08:58:16] <grafi> regarding jquery Tim__ ?
[08:58:24] <Tim__> Y
[08:58:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> compile meaning say I make change to var I need sass installed
[08:58:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[08:58:39] <Tim__> Have problem with drag layer
[08:59:15] <Tim__> Want to use addable post it notes
[08:59:30] <Tim__> But first without ajax
[09:00:48] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui oÃ´
[09:01:03] <grafi> just install the damn thing ^^
[09:02:16] <Tim__> @grafi.?
[09:03:43] <grafi> Tim__ so whats the problem? Maybe make a fiddle on http://jsfiddle.com to illustrate the problem for others to help you
[09:05:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: sry what?
[09:05:20] <grafi> i dont understand what you are asking ^^
[09:05:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> oaky nvm ill jsut install sass
[09:05:59] <grafi> great stuff :D
[09:06:00] <duch_kazatel> sass/less are good times.
[09:06:14] <duch_kazatel> nested selectors alone are awesome.
[09:06:21] <grafi> could still be better duch_kazatel :P
[09:06:36] <grafi> i ran into a wall just today
[09:06:37] <grafi> :P
[09:06:40] <duch_kazatel> oh?
[09:06:46] <grafi> and the fix is rather ugly
[09:06:53] <grafi> but still better than plain css of course
[09:06:54] <grafi> :)
[09:06:58] <duch_kazatel> what was the wall?
[09:07:27] <grafi> i wanted to generate some styles for different buttons
[09:07:36] <grafi> so different colors border-colors etc
[09:07:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi what version of ruby should i use
[09:08:07] <grafi> but apparently you cant loop through a list, and then call existing variables with the curretn list item
[09:08:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
[09:08:25] <grafi> the current one?
[09:08:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> 2.0.0 or 1.9.3
[09:08:34] <grafi> take 2.0.0
[09:09:00] <duch_kazatel> grafi aaaah fair enough
[09:09:03] <grafi> yeah
[09:09:10] <grafi>  the fix is using nested lists
[09:09:22] <grafi> and then using nth inside the thingie
[09:09:33] <grafi> but of course thats pretty ugly
[09:09:35] <duch_kazatel> that's not too bad imo.  but i'm an old css jockey so meh :)
[09:09:55] <grafi> compared to "dynamic" variable usage or whatever you might call it
[09:09:58] <Cork> airdem: no, hmm never seen that error before...
[09:10:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi brb
[09:10:13] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui kk :P+
[09:10:28] <airdem> Cork, i think there is smth wrong with var data = new FormData(form[0]);
[09:10:42] <airdem> console.log shows me an object with infinite constructors
[09:11:27] <Cork> airdem: and form[0] is an actual html form element?
[09:11:35] <airdem> checking that right now
[09:11:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: install sass btw
[09:11:57] <grafi> want a medal?
[09:11:58] <grafi> :P
[09:12:17] <airdem> Cork, yes it is
[09:12:31] <Cork> airdem: what browser?
[09:12:37] <airdem> firefox
[09:12:55] <airdem> i am doing all this stuff in <input type="file"> change event
[09:13:01] <airdem> could it be a problem?
[09:13:09] <Cork> possibly
[09:13:13] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui apparently i have no "well done" gifs in my collection :S
[09:13:14] <Cork> don't think so though
[09:14:22] <airdem> Cork, console.log(form[0]) returns <form class="accelerated" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="Start.php?action=documentUpload" method="post">
[09:14:40] <Cork> airdem: try creating an empty FormData object and add the field one at a time
[09:14:47] <thebope> Hi everyone, how are you? I have a quick question, how exactly in the api do I look up this function? $("[name*='companions']",this)
[09:14:52] <Cork> it's the only thing i can think of trying
[09:14:58] <Cork> though what you have should work
[09:15:04] <thebope> I understand that it means the attribute name contains 'companions'
[09:15:22] <thebope> but I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing with "this"
[09:15:27] <Cork> thebope: it's part of sizzle
[09:15:36] <Cork> ?g sizzle
[09:15:37] <b-ot> Cork: Sizzle JavaScript Selector Library â†’ http://sizzlejs.com/
[09:15:46] <thebope> ?g sizzle
[09:15:47] <b-ot> thebope: Sizzle JavaScript Selector Library â†’ http://sizzlejs.com/
[09:15:53] <thebope> ahh I see
[09:15:56] <thebope> Cork, Thanks
[09:17:29] <Cork> thebope: though i think *= is just part of native
[09:17:38] <Cork> thebope: it's a basic css selector
[09:17:40] <thebope> Yea that's a jquery selector for contains
[09:17:44] <Cork> ?mdn attribute selector
[09:17:45] <b-ot> Cork: Attribute selectors - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors
[09:17:54] <thebope> Oh is it css? I thought it was jquery haha
[09:18:08] <duch_kazatel> thebope sizzle uses css selectors
[09:18:11] <duch_kazatel> among other things.
[09:18:18] <Cork> thebope: most of the jquery selector magic is document.querySelectorAll
[09:18:35] <Cork> the :<magic funktions> is sizzle
[09:18:41] <thebope> duch_kazatel, yea it says standalone library
[09:18:47] <Cork> like :first, :contains and so on
[09:19:07] <duch_kazatel> sizzle can be standalone and is included in jquery for convenience.
[09:19:17] <thebope> Ahhh now it all comes together
[09:19:45] <thebope> Cork, duch_kazatel , thanks guys
[09:20:26] <duch_kazatel> np cap'n.
[09:20:31] <thebope> I'm a software engineer and I tell you pointers, malloc, and assembly language have nothing on modern web development ;-)
[09:21:14] <duch_kazatel> it's not too terribly hard - javascript is funny, but a little research will clarify a lot for you.
[09:21:27] <duch_kazatel> you'd probably find some use in Crockford's stuff about the subject.
[09:21:51] <test846> I really need some help cleaning me javascript up, http://jsfiddle.net/j2JVj/3/. Would apprecieate some help.
[09:22:13] <snover> itâ€™s not too terribly hard if you started in the industry in the 00s and learned what was relevant and what was no longer relevant as you went along
[09:22:17] <duch_kazatel> test846 for starters you have html tags in the script.
[09:22:31] <snover> i canâ€™t imagine what it is like to start today. so much outdated, bad, information
[09:23:17] <test846> What do you mean?
[09:23:48] <duch_kazatel> the script panel takes javascript - including <script> tags is invalid.
[09:24:38] <test846> Okay...would you mind helping me out?
[09:24:44] <duch_kazatel> sure - pm?
[09:24:48] <airdem> Cork, still getting same error :) https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7809614
[09:24:57] <test846> ok :)
[09:25:31] <airdem> Cork, instead of $(this)[0] i coudlve just used this right?
[09:26:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> now to learn this sass
[09:27:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: when i say sass the british special forces come to mind
[09:29:54] <DGD_> is it possible to change the mousedown event of an element?
[09:30:13] <duch_kazatel> you can prevent the default one and trigger a different one.
[09:30:44] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui thats SAS though no?
[09:30:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know but still
[09:30:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> comes to mind
[09:31:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> they are so pro
[09:31:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> SAS, been around longer than st6
[09:31:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> and gsg9
[09:31:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> and stuff
[09:31:50] <DGD_> I try and change it to a different function but the old one keeps getting fired?
[09:32:31] <Cork> airdem: yes
[09:32:32] <airdem> DGD_, google .preventDefault
[09:32:51] <Cork> airdem: but you don't append the field
[09:33:19] <Cork> airdem: you append this.files[0]
[09:34:11] <airdem> Cork, still getting same error. i think ill give up and try to use a plugin
[09:34:13] <airdem> meh
[09:34:21] <Cork> weird
[09:34:39] <airdem> Cork, stop wasting any time. thank you though!
[09:38:49] <thebope> snover, imagine starting today with very little experience on anything but small projects and jumping into huge 26000 line pages assembled from the play framework using bootstrap, jquery, and all the other good things
[09:39:07] <thebope> It's really cool, but shit if it isn't a heckuva time figuring out whats going on some times
[09:39:36] <thebope> duch_kazatel, thanks, noted, I will check Crockford's stuff out for some after work reading
[09:40:18] <snover> hopefully that little experience on small projects has taught you that bootstrap and jquery arenâ€™t appropriate for things of that sizeâ€¦
[09:41:23] <duch_kazatel> thebope my pleasure - he's very... particular about his opinions.  but some of his stuff (like his info about the new keyword) will help get you up to speed about what's going on in JS
[09:42:11] <thebope> snover, I jumped in in the middle but you may prove correct yet if we ever deploy to the public
[09:42:25] <thebope> currently its only an internal tool, it just happens to be gigantic
[09:42:47] <thebope> duch_kazatel,  sweet, I really like JS. All the functional aspects do make it a pretty awesom elanguage
[09:43:29] <duch_kazatel> thebope it's got some warts, but it's a neat language.  knowing that it's more functional that OO is a fantastic place to start.
[09:44:22] <thebope> Yea definitely. I haven't defined a class yet really
[09:44:41] <thebope> Alright back to work! See you guys in a bit. In a few months I'll be answering questions haha
[09:44:43] <duch_kazatel> that's because you technically can't
[09:44:44] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:44:49] <duch_kazatel> enjoy mano.
[09:44:54] <airdem> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7809957 can anybody explain line 2? what is that?
[09:44:59] <thebope> Thanks
[09:45:19] <duch_kazatel> airdem a directive to put the interpreter into strict mode
[09:46:37] <raj> is it unreasonable to have an ajax request for a click event once a second?
[09:47:05] <duch_kazatel> raj huh?
[09:47:30] <raj> I have a button, that when pressed, will ajax POST to the server
[09:47:56] <duch_kazatel> what was the "once a second" deal about?
[09:48:02] <raj> should I be concerned if the user presses the button about once a second 5 times?
[09:48:32] <duch_kazatel> it entirely depends on the amount of data, if it impacts subsequent page requests, amount of users....
[09:49:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi message when finished with sass
[09:49:23] <raj> about 300 characters of JSON data
[09:49:28] <airdem> raj, you could disable the button until the ajax has finished
[09:49:43] <raj> airdem, can't do that
[09:50:13] <raj> duch_kazatel, doesn't impact subsequent page requests
[09:50:20] <raj> and a reddit number of users
[09:50:41] <duch_kazatel> woah...
[09:51:04] <raj> relax, just future-proofing :)
[09:51:16] <airdem> ddos? :)
[10:02:42] <sparr> http://jsfiddle.net/sparr/78XQb/ I would like to write a userscript (not modify the existing script) so that the IP address is manipulated (reversed for example) before being displayed. How would I go about that?

[10:17:41] <Tomashe> hey guys i got var value = '<option value="0">Select</option>'; when i do value.attr("value") i get error since it doesnt apply to jquery object
[10:17:51] <Tomashe> how can i make my var value an jquery?
[10:18:04] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe var value = $('<option value="0">Select</option>');
[10:18:27] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:18:52] <Tomashe> let me show u my code
[10:19:35] <Tomashe> http://pastie.org/private/im4o8bt1ibrykjk9xf4a
[10:19:54] <shoky> value.value
[10:20:09] <Tomashe> shoky, did u look at the code
[10:20:14] <shoky> (don't call it value, it's an <option>)
[10:20:16] <shoky> yes
[10:20:40] <shoky> selected.each(function() { console.log( this.value ) })
[10:20:46] <Tomashe> ok
[10:20:55] <Tomashe> valu.value worked
[10:20:58] <shoky> or if you want to just put them in that array then
[10:21:16] <shoky> is it a multi-select?
[10:21:20] <Tomashe> there is another way to use tthe .attr?
[10:21:48] <shoky> there are many ways.. this.value, $(this).val(), $(this).attr('value')
[10:22:32] <shoky> but you can just do:  var selected_array = selected.map(function() { return this.value }).get();
[10:23:23] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:23:29] <shoky> o didnt see duch already gave you an answer
[10:23:35] <Tomashe> :)
[10:23:49] <Tomashe> i was needed your answer
[10:24:27] <shoky> what he said would work too  (putting $(...) around the option)
[10:31:47] <nmee> Hi guys, what could cause a selection to be lost in a textbox? I have a large segment of code running immediately after a 'change' is fired when the user moves focus from textbox1 to textbox2. All text in textbox2 is selected when the code begins, but the selection is dropped somewhere in the code and I have no idea where. Textbox2 still has focus, though
[10:33:37] <Quest>  well the table is inside a jquery dialog box and it seems that I cant apply something like this to  it  .attachment tbody tr:nth-child(2n){background: #d3d3d3;}

[10:38:47] <Quest> hm
[10:41:34] <Quest> NoiseEee,  not working
[10:42:35] <Quest> NoiseEee,  any way to do that with dialogClass:
[10:43:13] <NoiseEee> i don't know what dialogClass is
[10:43:20] <NoiseEee> Quest: make a jsfiddle?
[10:52:51] <Quest> NoiseEee,  works. how to add more than one style like bg color
[10:53:27] <shoky> read the docs?
[10:53:36] <Quest> k
[10:57:32] <vince164> Hello how can i get the title attribute of the item that the mouseover is on
[10:57:54] <duch_kazatel> depending on how you're doing the event binding, $(this).attr('title');
[10:58:24] <vince164> yes that was it thanks
[11:16:24] <Fishbowne> anyone ever have trouble loading jquery-ui ?
[11:16:32] <Fishbowne> after a jquery load ?
[11:20:19] <TheEternalAbyss> hello, question..if I wanted to monitor a pages load time.. when does a status 200 occur? does it happen upon completion of the page loading everything including all dynamic content? Or you'd get a status regardless of any dynamic content being loaded from a db?
[11:20:52] <TheEternalAbyss> i mean how would jquery/javascript see a request of that kind
[11:20:57] <thebope> status 200 is returned from the server
[11:21:03] <thebope> all statuses are
[11:21:20] <thebope> dynamic content which comes with the return will be included
[11:21:34] <thebope> but status content which is loaded later won't be
[11:21:51] <snover> there are multiple states of progress within an XHR object but jQuery only does anything once the entire request is finished.
[11:21:55] <TheEternalAbyss> so if I click a link that triggers a series of fetches, it won't give me a 200 until it's done?
[11:22:19] <snover> if you use an XHR object directly there is an event when headers are available before the body has been retrieved
[11:22:21] <thebope> I think so
[11:23:08] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm
[11:23:35] <TheEternalAbyss> you know... maybe I'm over thinking my problem..
[11:32:41] <hschultz> I've run into an issue where clicking to drag a draggable widget that contains a very large number of children crashes Chrome 32 (beta).  I've already reported it to the Chromium project, since obviously, it's Chrome that's crashing.  Should I report it as a jQuery defect too?  (I do have a jsfiddle to reproduce it.)
[11:34:20] <thesisb> Does it only crash on Chrome?
[11:34:33] <thesisb> Wouldn't hurt to report it to jQuery team
[11:34:41] <thesisb> if only to bring it to people's attention
[11:35:01] <duch_kazatel> they might also need to come up with a fix on their end.
[11:35:20] <hschultz> So far as I've found, it only crashes in Chrome.  By "crash" here, I do mean that Chrome spits out the "Aw, Snap" message.
[11:36:07] <shoky> how many children?
[11:37:10] <duch_kazatel> sure, but depending on the scope of the problem, the jQuery team might need to get in a fix for it anyway.
[11:37:24] <hschultz> My jsfiddle has 200k children.  My actual real-world example was a table with 10k rows.  http://jsfiddle.net/vuX59/6/
[11:38:11] <shoky> ;S
[11:39:34] <limpc> i forgot what someone said to do in order to reset css transforms for a menu attached to a rotated image (not canvas, css3 transforms only)?
[11:39:40] <shoky> appending to the DOM 200,000 times is never a good idea
[11:40:02] <NoiseEee> hschultz: in what 'real world' can a person understand a table with 10k rows?
[11:40:11] <limpc> this is what im currently trying, but it doesnt work http://pastebin.com/5SbwgB9U
[11:41:07] <limpc> NoiseEee: beancounters with monitors set to portrait view. they often need to see alot of data at once for skimming and such.  Though one could argue you wouldnt need to skim if you implement search.
[11:41:37] <hschultz> NoiseEee:  The table shows information about markers on a map.  You click on a marker on the map, and it scrolls to the correct entry in the table, which has different information than what pops up on the map.
[11:41:41] <NoiseEee> limpc: yeah there's no real valid use case, its beyond comprehension... either search or paginate or any other way than presenting 10,000 rows of data
[11:42:01] <NoiseEee> hschultz: instead of it 'scrolling to the entry in the table', why not bring up relevant data on demand for the marker?
[11:42:22] <NoiseEee> ie: sure, present a 'table row' type of information, but screw rendering a table with 10,000 rows
[11:42:34] <NoiseEee> if you need, load an object with 10,000 keys and just hit that up
[11:42:51] <limpc> yeah its a bad idea to do 10k rows for many reasons.  it bogs down the browser, and eats up alot of network traffic
[11:43:10] <NoiseEee> var myMarkerData = { marker1:{population:500,capital:'funTown'},marker2:{}}  etc
[11:44:51] <hschultz> 10k rows is the upper limit that we set.  It used to be 1k, but the software has now been optimized such that it works with more.  Most users would probably only be looking at a day's worth of data, which means they'll probably only be looking at a few hundred points, but in some cases, we ran into situations where there would be more than 1k points in a day.
[11:45:15] <limpc> imagine 1000 people pulling 10k rows.. if one row is about 500b of data, thats easily 5gb of data
[11:46:03] <NoiseEee> hschultz: i don't deny the need for a user to view details about any of 10,000 possibilities
[11:46:10] <NoiseEee> hschultz: but present them *on demand*
[11:46:11] <hschultz> There won't be 1000 people pulling 10k rows.  We have a relatively small user base.  Very few users will be looking at this data to begin with.
[11:46:38] <NoiseEee> rework the UI/idea
[11:47:12] <NoiseEee> its like pre-loading 10,000 images so that the user can quickly access any of them quickly
[11:47:21] <NoiseEee> it just doesnt make sense. there's a better way to implement the UI/UX
[11:47:47] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee agreed
[11:48:23] <shoky> hschultz: also just by fixing up the code a bit, no more crash and it's much faster http://jsfiddle.net/vuX59/10/
[11:49:09] <hschultz> I'm not disputing your arguments.  They are good arguments.  The problem is that the program is done and has been for quite some time, and the issue is just now coming up.
[11:49:30] <NoiseEee> ahh well maybe shoky's way (tm) can help
[11:50:04] <shoky> shoky's way: don't append to the live DOM 200000 times in a loop and expect decent performance
[11:51:04] <hschultz_> ...well that definitely didn't NOT crash for me.
[11:51:20] <limpc> how do i straighten out a menu's orientation when its attached to a rotated parent (rotated using css3 transforms, not canvas)?
[11:51:50] <hschultz_> but yes, I'm doing something very similar in the actual code on the shipping product, and it was one of many things that significantly sped up the responsiveness.
[11:52:08] <limpc> shipping?  you're selling this?
[11:52:35] <hschultz_> Yup.
[11:52:44] <limpc> for the love of god do it right then :)
[11:54:40] <hschultz_> I'd love to, but it's been this way since before I started, and we just went to beta with another major update, so it's too late to rewrite.  Since I started, I've found ways to make it significantly faster at what it was already doing, but for right this moment, we can't squeeze a rewrite into the schedule.
[11:54:46] <shoky> o gawd chrome canary changes so many ui elements
[11:55:05] <limpc> well you're gonna have alot of these people then.. https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQV2upkMcgMNeMyJPuQaSX21GVhSVfMdbIsdjYDrnHekMvlZEQb
[11:55:27] <shoky> eh. chrome's looking more and more like windows 8 :(
[11:56:28] <shoky> anyway hschultz_ the fiddle works just fine for me.. in both stable and canary
[11:56:53] <Fishbowne> anyone having trouble getting the draggable function to work in jquery-ui ?
[11:57:08] <Fishbowne> seems like if I try to implement it, my code breaks.
[11:57:18] <hschultz_> The fiddle hasn't crashed for me on stable.  It has done it intermittently in canary, but it does it pretty consistently in beta.
[11:58:54] <hschultz_> Anyway, thanks for the input.  I'll add a rewrite to the list of feature requests for the next version.
[12:01:39] <shoky> Fishbowne: no. http://jsfiddle.net/2zBp9/
[12:02:23] <Reedyseth> Hello Guys !!
[12:19:08] <limpc> how do i straighten out a menu's orientation when its attached to a rotated parent (rotated using css3 transforms, not canvas)?
[12:19:26] <limpc> the menu shows up on :hover
[12:28:18] <sparr> http://jsfiddle.net/sparr/78XQb/4/ <-- Without modifying this script, in a userscript (another separate script that runs when this fiddle loads), how can I change the behavior of the AJAX callback for the second button, perhaps to reverse the IP that is displayed?
[12:31:59] <Fishbowne> anyone know what to call to wait for jquery-ui to load ?
[12:32:05] <Fishbowne> is it the same as jquery ?
[12:35:04] <shoky> Fishbowne: wait for what to load exactly? you don't have to do anything special like that in jquery-ui
[12:35:19] <shoky> (except for the regular DOM ready or whatever)
[12:53:50] <Tomashe> hey guys i got some Help i need,im not sure its regarding to this exact jquery thing but maybe someone can help. so the situation is like that.. im using the countdown jquery plugin. when count down is over its refreshing the page.. the issue is , when the page refreshes it looks like it show cached version.. this happened only on IE . anyone can help?
[13:11:27] <ZombieDroid> hi I've got a pretty straitforward question...
[13:12:00] <ZombieDroid> I've been trying to implement custom scroll bars and it seems like the simplest way to do so is using the jscrollpane scripts
[13:12:48] <grafi> ZombieDroid thats not a question :)
[13:12:57] <ZombieDroid> I've downloaded a copy of the base site to see how it was implemented there and when loading to my browser from the local files the event listeners do not appear to fire
[13:13:02] <Ferrari> Hello
[13:13:14] <ZombieDroid> sorry
[13:13:16] <ZombieDroid> Grafi
[13:13:21] <ZombieDroid> bit long winded lol
[13:13:24] <grafi> :P
[13:14:38] <ZombieDroid> basically I'm trying to find out why when I load the html to browser from my drive the events do not fire for the scroll bars
[13:14:47] <ZombieDroid> I've made no changes to the source files...
[13:15:27] <grafi> which example are you looking at ZombieDroid ?
[13:15:50] <ZombieDroid> I've saved this site to my harddrive: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/basic.html
[13:16:06] <ZombieDroid> and when loading from there none of the scrollbars are functioning
[13:16:16] <grafi> what like ctrl+s ?
[13:16:41] <ZombieDroid> yeah, the one that saves the html and all the source files...
[13:17:14] <ZombieDroid> what I"m literally doing is right clicking the background and choosing save as...
[13:17:20] <grafi> high probability the files arent referenced correctly
[13:17:30] <grafi> just go to the github repo and download the whole thing
[13:17:52] <grafi> https://github.com/vitch/jScrollPane/archive/master.zip ZombieDroid
[13:20:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: sro got knocked out
[13:20:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> will tal kto you in a few
[13:20:10] <grafi> xD
[13:20:16] <grafi> knocked out
[13:20:20] <grafi> sounds aggressive
[13:21:32] <ZombieDroid> thanks for the help Grafi, now I just have to find out why they aren't firing in my implementation lol
[13:21:46] <ZombieDroid> the repo you linked is working ;)
[13:22:29] <grafi> it better be
[13:38:02] <Reedyseth> how do I clean the messages on the webchat.freenode.net page ??
[13:38:10] <Reedyseth> #clean
[13:38:13] <Reedyseth> #clear
[13:39:23] <Reedyseth> :clean
[13:39:25] <Reedyseth> .clear
[13:39:34] <hugo_moss> anyone here use fancybox?
[13:39:41] <Reedyseth> I have !!
[13:40:19] <hugo_moss> i have an issue where if you have fancybox open, completely zoom in, then completely zoom out, then close fancybox, scrolling on the body becomes choppy
[13:40:33] <hugo_moss> starts to lag
[13:40:59] <hugo_moss> on the ipad3
[13:43:13] <Reedyseth> hugo_moss: That is a issue with your website template, you must build it responsive in order to fit any device and therefore handle the zoom in and zoom out.
[13:44:16] <Reedyseth> !help
[13:44:16] <b-ot> Reedyseth: NO U!
[13:46:18] <hugo_moss> no i dont think thats the problem
[13:47:18] <hugo_moss> the site is responsive, and fits the container right, but all mobile devices have a zoom in zoom out capability
[13:48:54] <shoky> Reedyseth: check the webchat's settings, you can hide the joins/parts/quits
[13:52:43] <hugo_moss> shoky, you ever use fancybox?
[13:53:35] <petey> anyway to inspect a :before or :after?
[13:53:36] <shoky> hugo_moss nopes
[13:53:46] <duch_kazatel> PeterBooker huh?
[13:53:49] <shoky> petey chrome devtools
[13:53:51] <petey> I have never seen this before, but this dev decided to use :before and :after in the input boxes for placeholder text
[13:54:02] <petey> shoky, how? i don't have the menu pop up like I usually do to inspect on breakpoint, etc.
[13:54:22] <shoky> you can see it on the right side i nthe elements view
[13:54:34] <shoky> with the rest of the css
[13:54:44] <sethetter> I'm having an issue with a .keydown() handler. It's checking cursor position and performing some logic based on that, but if I'm typing quickly then the multiple calls end of stepping on eachother. Is there a way to get around this?
[13:55:38] <stringoO> how do i find what events I can tap into for an input field? I want to execute a function when a user finishes sliding a range input slider, but onchange triggers it too many times. I want to only call the function when the user is done sliding the range slider.
[13:57:27] <duch_kazatel> stringoO what slider are you using?
[13:57:49] <stringoO> <input id="" type="range"...
[13:57:54] <stringoO> just a range input type
[13:58:11] <stringoO> with this js file to make it work in firefox - https://github.com/fryn/html5slider
[13:58:57] <stringoO> is .mouseup() acceptable?
[13:59:13] <duch_kazatel> i don't know what events are available.
[13:59:47] <duch_kazatel> I'm looking.
[14:00:17] <stringoO> Thanks! :)
[14:00:35] <stringoO> I've been trying to figure it out from http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[14:01:18] <duch_kazatel> tbh i don't have a ton of time to look, but you might want to go to MDN or a similar resource to figure it out.
[14:03:14] <stringoO> sounds good, thanks!
[14:19:32] <Sh0rtWave> HI all
[14:19:57] <Sh0rtWave> I've got a problem with JQuery where every time picker I try to use, the pop-up parts of the panel show up at the bottom of the page, well away from the actual component it's supposed to be attached to.
[14:20:56] <Sh0rtWave> This is on a Drupal 7.24 installation, with the JQuery UPdate module applied so I'm up to JQuery 1.8.
[14:21:23] <jsc802> if i am doing a json request for a php file, should i make the php file have a header('Content-Type: application/javascript');
[14:21:27] <jsc802> or does it not matter at all
[14:21:49] <Sh0rtWave> I've tried all kinds of plugins for this too.
[14:24:55] <jsc802> anyone know?
[14:25:54] <TViernion> how would i go about finding what jquery menu a site is using?
[14:26:44] <jsc802> nvm
[14:26:59] <jsc802> TViernion: look at the page source?
[14:27:11] <TViernion> jsc802 ... i have been.. and it's not very clear...
[14:27:45] <jsc802> I would take a bit of the source code and put it in google ;p
[14:27:53] <jsc802> chances are its hosted somewhere
[14:29:36] <TViernion> it's this place rendercore.com
[14:29:54] <TViernion> they have this wicked cool menu on their inside .. side...
[14:31:32] <TViernion> i'll send you a picture
[14:32:08] <jsc802> which one? the carousel?
[14:33:07] <TViernion> i duno.. one second... i had to find a way to get it there
[14:33:56] <TViernion> http://www.flickr.com/photos/110697783@N07/
[14:34:30] <TViernion> see that jsc802?
[14:35:24] <jsc802> well i dont see that probably because im not logged in
[14:35:31] <jsc802> but it looks a lot like a bootstrap menu
[14:35:40] <TViernion> okay... bootstrap menu...
[14:35:52] <TViernion> yes.. that's gotta be there i see that css file
[14:35:53] <jsc802> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/examples/hero.html
[14:37:47] <TViernion> AHHH that's it!
[14:39:03] <jsc802> :)
[14:39:15] <jsc802> bootstrap 2 had some really pretty css
[14:40:58] <tlm_working> o/
[14:41:46] <tlm_working> trying to find an alternative to this:
[14:42:00] <tlm_working> $('#top .row .8u p strong').each(function(i){(!i?$(this).css({'font-size':'2.2em','font-weight':'100'}):"")});
[14:42:36] <tlm_working> basically changes the font weight of the 1st element in array
[14:42:47] <tlm_working> i tried
[14:42:49] <tlm_working> var p_arr = $('#top .row .8u p strong').toArray();
[14:42:56] <tlm_working> p_arr[0].css({'font-size':'2.2em','font-weight':'100'});
[14:43:00] <TViernion> now that i have bootstrap.. i just include the <script src="js/bootstrap.js">  right?
[14:43:03] <jsc802> .first()?
[14:43:43] <tlm_working> any ideas why the array key cannot css that way??
[14:44:04] <jsc802> TViernon: you need the css files too
[14:44:09] <tlm_working> *cannot be styled
[14:44:28] <TViernion> well i know that but thats'a link href=" thing..
[14:44:29] <jsc802> if you just want the dropdown you can build what you need here:
[14:44:29] <jsc802> getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/customize.html
[14:46:16] <TViernion> heh.. isnt' that special
[14:46:58] <TViernion> here's the question though.. i wonder if it'll do a sub menu..
[14:47:01] * TViernion goes to find out
[14:48:30] <jsc802> tlm_working im guessing because javascript arrays dont work the same as jquery arrays
[14:49:55] <tlm_working> ahhh
[14:50:02] <tlm_working> tytyty
[14:50:16] <tlm_working> that answers a lot :D !
[14:55:29] <duch_kazatel> jsc802 err, javascript and jquery "arrays" are the same thing.,
[14:55:46] <jsc802> jquery objects then
[14:56:02] <duch_kazatel> jquery objects just have a bunch of special methods, but they're the same as normal object.
[14:56:04] <duch_kazatel> *objects
[15:03:42] <Drizzt321> I'm trying to perform an AJAX call to a local Jetty server that I have running to test an API, however my server is throwing an error "Connection reset by peer". When I use the exact same URL in my browser bar, it works just fine. Anyone have any thoughts what I might be doing wrong on my AJAX call?
[15:04:54] <Drizzt321> I am receiving a 200 response, it's just no body in the response which I am expecting
[15:05:04] <tlm_working> perhaps the call needs headers with useragent settings just a guess..
[15:05:24] <tlm_working> its your API ?
[15:05:27] <Drizzt321> hmm...well, it's getting into my controller and executing fine
[15:05:34] <Drizzt321> and I'm returning the results back up the stack
[15:06:01] <Drizzt321> and the HTTP request done by Jquery is using my browsers UA (Latest Firefox if it makes a difference)
[15:06:14] <tlm_working> hrm
[15:06:25] <Drizzt321> could Transfer-Encoding: chunked do anything?
[15:06:42] <tlm_working> now that I'm not sure of
[15:07:01] <Drizzt321> I wouldn't think so, that's just a header that firefox is receiving back on the call
[15:07:14] <tlm_working> I just know that some api calls need proper headers
[15:08:40] <Drizzt321> hmm...wait, the response is being received by firefox (looking via Firebug)
[15:10:11] <Drizzt321> ah
[15:10:23] <Drizzt321> it's trying to parse the json, and it gets unexpected end of data
[15:10:29] <tlm_working> ahhh
[15:10:44] <tlm_working> how did you debug that? if you don't mind me asking
[15:10:54] <Drizzt321> combination of Firebug
[15:11:00] <Drizzt321> and then the firefox web/developer console
[15:11:03] <Drizzt321> under the Network tab
[15:11:19] <Drizzt321> looking at the Response, it says "SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected end of data"
[15:11:29] <tlm_working> nice, thanks for that info..
[15:12:08] <Drizzt321> although http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/ says the json chunk firebug saw is valid
[15:12:45] <tlm_working> hrmm
[15:13:38] <jsc802> try http://jsonlint.com/
[15:14:29] <Drizzt321> jsc802: that says valid too
[15:14:42] <Drizzt321> it's weird that I'm getting the exception in my server though
[15:14:57] <TViernion> jsc802 thanks for your help man... now i've just got to get sub menus in there... if possible
[15:15:00] <jsc802> is your server serving it with the right header?
[15:15:20] <jsc802> header('Content-Type: application/javascript')
[15:15:40] <Drizzt321> yup, in the headers I'm seeing the ajax call ask for json, and my server is returning json
[15:16:08] <jsc802> TViernion i'm sure you can find it try googling bootstrap multilevel
[15:16:21] <TViernion> oh i know.. just gotta get there?
[15:16:31] <spike021> Hey. I'm just getting started with Jquery, specifically jquery mobile. I'm using a listview and would like a new html file to be loaded when an item in the list is selected. The way I have it right now causes "Error loading page" to appear. any ideas?
[15:16:51] <spike021> i know it's a very broad question
[15:16:55] <jsc802> jsfiddle.net/chirayu45/YXkUT/16/
[15:17:05] <jsc802> er that ones ugly
[15:18:14] <spike021> to be more specific, can I not use href's in list items of a listview?
[15:33:36] <Fishbowne> Okay so I can get Jquery-ui to work by using Jquery.noconflict... but the Jquery.ui still returns 0... any ideas ?
[15:34:04] <Fishbowne> meaning I can't use jquery.ui as a condition for doing Jquery-ui stuff...
[15:34:14] <Fishbowne> anyone ?
[15:59:50] <Fishbowne> Okay so I can get Jquery-ui to work by using Jquery.noconflict... but the Jquery.ui still returns 0... any ideas ?
[15:59:53] <Fishbowne> meaning I can't use jquery.ui as a condition for doing Jquery-ui stuff...
[16:04:45] <Drizzt321> Ok, so, I'm now just sending back plain text, and the JQuery Ajax is still calling the error handler.
[16:04:48] <Drizzt321> WTF
[16:07:56] <Drizzt321> In firefox web developer tool, the network section, the XHR that is sent keeps saying 0KB size, but it gets a HTTP 200 and a content-length: 2064 header. In firebug, I see the request and the source data
[16:08:20] <shoky> Drizzt321 can you pastebin/screenshot relevant code/request&response-headers&body
[16:08:34] <shoky> Drizzt321 also check what happens in chrome
[16:08:43] <Drizzt321> hmm...ok, let me try chrome quick then
[16:10:05] <Drizzt321> oh
[16:10:07] <Drizzt321> " No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. "
[16:10:16] <shoky> thought it might be that
[16:10:19] <shoky> firebug sucks
[16:10:21] <Drizzt321> facepalm
[16:10:36] <Drizzt321> shoky: yea, but the Firefox web developer tool didn't say that either
[16:10:47] <duch_kazatel> firefox's dev tools are a bummer.  i prefer firebug.
[16:10:51] <shoky> well i meant firefox devtools
[16:10:54] <Drizzt321> although with chrome I had to go to the console
[16:11:07] <Drizzt321> rather than the network request
[16:11:10] <shoky> donno i got firebug installed and i get no indication whatsoever about CORS issues
[16:11:11] <Drizzt321> but at least I still got a message somewhere
[16:11:23] <shoky> yeah it's dumb that it's just in the console
[16:11:27] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see the link personally.
[16:11:42] <krambiorix> hi, i wrote a jquery plugin with some functions in it like jQuery.fn.extend({	setGlobalListeners: function(){......... -> how do i declare a global variable?
[16:12:09] <Drizzt321> well, now that I know what it is I'll just go fix those settings
[16:12:30] <Drizzt321> ugh
[16:12:40] <Drizzt321> it's because I'm opening a raw HTML file rather than from the server
[16:14:53] <Drizzt321> and now that I added Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * response, working great!
[16:51:35] <krambiorix> anyone here?
[16:52:01] <duch_kazatel> i am
[16:54:27] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, i wrote a jquery plugin with some functions in it like jQuery.fn.extend({	setGlobalListeners: function(){......... -> how do i declare a global variable?
[16:54:50] <duch_kazatel> I really wouldn't suggest it.
[16:55:40] <duch_kazatel> you should have everything setup to be methods in jquery instead.
[16:56:02] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, how should i do that?
[16:57:06] <duch_kazatel> add a method to $.fn
[16:57:27] <duch_kazatel> make sure you return this; so folks can chain
[16:57:32] <duch_kazatel> read this: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[16:57:56] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, i did, but i don't know if it needs to be a plugin
[16:58:10] <krambiorix> i mean, it's just a bunch of functions that belong together
[16:58:23] <duch_kazatel> are you going to distribute this?
[16:59:17] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, nope
[17:00:12] <duch_kazatel> well, there are two things you can do - 1 is to create a plugin (the smarter way long-term if you plan on using this a lot among projects).  the other option is just do window.varName
[17:01:17] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, i'd go with a plugin then
[17:01:55] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're polluting the global namespace, which i'd avoid.
[17:02:29] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, can i use global vars in the plugin?
[17:02:53] <duch_kazatel> I wouldn't suggest it.
[17:03:47] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, but how to store variables that are used cross functions?
[17:04:06] <Sh0rtWave> I've got a problem with JQuery where every time picker I try to use, the pop-up parts of the panel show up at the bottom of the page, well away from the actual component it's supposed to be attached to.
[17:04:09] <duch_kazatel> hoist them up only as far as you need - create an object that contains everything that you wanjt to use.
[17:04:19] <Sh0rtWave> Anyone else encounter this?
[17:04:38] <duch_kazatel> OR use function params.
[17:04:39] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:07:17] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, okay
[17:07:24] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, thanks a lot for your information!
[17:07:58] <duch_kazatel> not a problem.
[17:08:17] <Fishbowne> Okay so I can get Jquery-ui to work by using Jquery.noconflict... but the Jquery.ui still returns 0... any ideas ?
[17:08:20] <Fishbowne> meaning I can't use jquery.ui as a condition for doing Jquery-ui stuff...
[17:08:56] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne have a fiddle?
[17:09:05] <Fishbowne> no.
[17:09:19] <duch_kazatel> that'll help us see what you're seeing.
[17:10:06] <Fishbowne> well, theres not much to know other than, when I tried to do $('#divname').draggable(); it kept breaking my code until I used the jQuery.noconflict() function
[17:10:40] <Fishbowne> but then when i use that, jQuery.ui still returns 0... acting like Jquery-ui isn't loaded... (but it must be) because now its working
[17:10:59] <duch_kazatel> fiddle? :)
[17:11:44] <Fishbowne> id have to copy my whole page out to fiddle...
[17:12:41] <Fishbowne> maybe the Jquery.ui parameter is unreliable ?
[17:12:43] <duch_kazatel> have you even tried making a test page with the bare minimum to replicate the problem?
[17:12:50] <Fishbowne> yes.
[17:12:51] <grafi> nope
[17:12:52] <grafi> :p
[17:12:59] <Fishbowne> its works with a bare min page the way its supposed toi
[17:13:01] <Fishbowne> to
[17:13:19] <grafi> thats where you expand to where it doesnt work anymore
[17:13:22] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:13:24] <duch_kazatel> ka-bingoi
[17:13:27] <duch_kazatel> *ka-bingo
[17:13:34] <grafi> ka-blui
[17:14:21] <Fishbowne> well just wondered if anyone rant into that issue...
[17:14:25] <Fishbowne> ran.
[17:14:47] <Fishbowne> where Jquery.noconflict allows Jquery.ui to work, but testing for Jquery.ui fails.
[17:14:56] <Fishbowne> doesn't seem to make sense.
[17:16:09] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're loading jquery twice or something.
[17:16:28] <Fishbowne> nah cut all scripts out except jquery and jquery.ui
[17:16:31] <duch_kazatel> or you're loading prototype
[17:16:32] <Fishbowne> same issue.
[17:16:40] <Fishbowne> loading prototype ?
[17:16:44] <duch_kazatel> prototype.js
[17:16:51] <duch_kazatel> or was that mootools...
[17:16:59] <Fishbowne> nope... and nope.
[17:17:11] <Fishbowne> I am using html5boilerplate as a tempplate.
[17:17:17] <duch_kazatel> anyway, you said that you could get it to work with the bare minimum, so something in your code must be doing something it shouldn't
[17:17:48] <Fishbowne> Fair enough Duch, but the code runs fine as long as Jquery.noconflict is present.
[17:18:02] <Fishbowne> hwoever if I test for Jquery.ui it fails... always says 0.
[17:18:13] <duch_kazatel> and you know what jQuery.noConflict does, right?
[17:18:14] <Fishbowne> er jQuery.ui sorry.
[17:18:26] <Fishbowne> yes I know it allows the $ operator to be released.
[17:18:49] <Fishbowne> but why would Jquery run and not be loadedd ?
[17:19:23] <Fishbowne> but yes again, in a minimum setup, jQuery.ui gets set to 1.
[17:19:30] <Fishbowne> well, !0.
[17:19:36] <Fishbowne> (not zero)
[17:19:52] <duch_kazatel> then check the rest of your code :)
[17:20:54] <Fishbowne> I just wondered if there was a jQuery.ui document ready function... or if document.ready had issues.
[17:21:05] <Fishbowne> (has issues)
[17:21:18] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:44:04] <s34n> I have an ajax query with a done and a fail callback. firebug shows me a 200 OK result, but jquery invokes the fail callback
[17:44:04] <Fishbowne> so weird, my code runs fine in JSfiddle.
[17:53:36] <shoky> s34n and what arguments does jquery invoke the fail callback with?
[18:07:32] <TheIronSky> OY!!
[18:14:11] <s34n> shoky: good question. My callback doesn't define any arguments.
[18:14:38] <s34n> shoky: So let me rearrange and I'll see
[18:17:53] <kansai> hi all
[18:18:00] <kansai> having problem with Jquery
[18:18:03] <kansai> i wanna do drap drop process on html5 so i use adobe edge , i think i am doing wrong with ''if statements'' , if moving object belong there im going to hide it.. for example i am moving the objcet name e5 , how can i hide ?
[18:18:23] <duch_kazatel> kansai have a fiddle?
[18:19:10] <kansai> yes
[18:19:12] <kansai> kazatel
[18:22:52] <kansai> duch_kazatel:  http://pastebin.com/0cf5wrzg
[18:24:07] <louism2wash> Hey guys, I am trying to figure out a way to fire a method only after a loop has iterated over all elements of an array.  I have read about the promise() method but I am having trouble implementing it.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.  https://gist.github.com/
[18:24:34] <louism2wash> sorry;  https://gist.github.com/louism2/7817598
[18:24:41] <duch_kazatel> kansai a fiddle is preferred to a pastebin link.
[18:25:12] <kansai> what is fiddle duch_kazatel  ?
[18:25:16] <duch_kazatel> kansai some HTMl would be helpful.
[18:25:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[18:25:50] <kansai> some html ... any idea ?
[18:26:14] <duch_kazatel> kansai e1 is not a tag...
[18:26:30] <duch_kazatel> so i have no idea what you're trying to do.  a working example would be helpful.
[18:27:50] <kansai> what is e1 then duch_kazatel ?
[18:28:08] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea.  i need to see some html.
[18:28:33] <jsc802> i have a question that may be general javascript question
[18:28:53] <kansai> maybe i should use $(this) duch_kazatel
[18:29:11] <duch_kazatel> kansai you need to setup a fully functional example in the fiddle for me to help.
[18:29:21] <jsc802> i want to load a javascript file synchronously but have a part of the filename be variable
[18:29:24] <jsc802> anyone know how to do that?
[18:29:58] <dioms> hey guys, i'm trying to build something like kissmetrics, are there any good guides on getting started with something like that?
[18:30:25] <louism2wash> jsc802: from what is the variable being generated?
[18:30:29] <duch_kazatel> jsc802 create a script tag and use a var for the src attribute, then build it.
[18:31:10] <duch_kazatel> like, build up a string with whatever you want, then use that var for the src.
[18:31:22] <kansai> duch_kazatel:  basicly what i need is : i have 18 draggable box and 4 droppable space but box will not match with space .. only will be hidden at the corret space .. if its not on a correct space it will be turn back
[18:31:32] <jsc802> document.write("<script src='script-"+var+".js'><\/script>");
[18:31:32] <jsc802>  will that work?
[18:31:35] <duch_kazatel> kansai still not enough.
[18:31:41] <jsc802> according to this page that would be asynchronous http://ntt.cc/2008/02/10/4-ways-to-dynamically-load-external-javascriptwith-source.html
[18:31:57] <duch_kazatel> oh you want synchronous..
[18:32:37] <jsc802> yeah
[18:33:51] <jsc802> i think i found the answer, its the XHR one
[18:34:11] <jsc802> but does that work cross domain i wonder
[18:34:33] <duch_kazatel> that's ajax
[18:34:45] <Fishbowne> okay figured it out... HTML5boilerplate loads script at bottom.
[18:34:49] <Fishbowne> instead of top.
[18:34:58] <Fishbowne> whoever said I was loading Js twice... you were right.
[18:35:21] <Fishbowne> or sorry jQuery twice.
[18:35:24] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne is this that weird jquery ui thing?
[18:35:29] <Fishbowne> yes
[18:35:31] <Fishbowne> solved.
[18:35:36] <duch_kazatel> :) good!
[18:35:39] <Fishbowne> thanks I think it was you duch...
[18:35:54] <Fishbowne> is that common practice load the code AFTER the body ?
[18:36:06] <Fishbowne> I thought you ususally did it in the head section.
[18:36:13] <duch_kazatel> it depends.
[18:36:23] <s34n> shoky: it just says Ajax error
[18:36:45] <Fishbowne> works flawlessly now.
[18:36:50] <duch_kazatel> if you don't need it for content, then right before </body> is great because it basically defers loading and execution until AFTER your content is showing up.
[18:37:05] <Fishbowne> duch, makes sense.
[18:37:39] <kansai> yes duch_kazatel  thanks
[18:38:57] <Fishbowne> anyways, after Jsfiddle reproduced the error I decided to look at the default HTML5boilerlate index.html file and there was the double loading.
[18:39:05] <Fishbowne> (well i caused the double loading)
[18:39:06] <s34n> shoky: the jXhr.status is 0, but firebug says it the http response is 200
[18:39:07] <duch_kazatel> aaah
[18:39:10] <duch_kazatel> sounds about right.
[18:39:19] <Fishbowne> yep thanks.
[18:39:56] <s34n> firefox debugger also says http status was 200
[18:40:11] <s34n> why does jquery think the status is 0?
[18:40:17] <Fishbowne> Heres a question... just throwing this out there....   why not use iframes instead of doing ajax calls ?
[18:40:24] <Fishbowne> hidden iframes.
[18:40:41] <Fishbowne> then just parse your respose however you need to.
[18:40:42] <duch_kazatel> and then doing what with them?
[18:40:47] <duch_kazatel> Ã¨w.
[18:40:53] <Fishbowne> ew ?
[18:40:57] <duch_kazatel> iframes.
[18:41:02] <Fishbowne> hidden iframes.
[18:41:06] <Fishbowne> solves the cross domain problem.
[18:41:06] <duch_kazatel> iframes still lol
[18:41:14] <Fishbowne> youtube... embeds with iframes.
[18:41:20] <duch_kazatel> i know they do.,
[18:41:34] <Fishbowne> LOL all day. it works.
[18:42:12] <Fishbowne> you can write a rest-API or whatever, and return your data via iframes.
[18:42:15] <Fishbowne> hidden iframes.
[18:42:23] <Fishbowne> instead of ajax and divs.
[18:42:24] <duch_kazatel> that's really gross lol
[18:42:29] <Fishbowne> how come /
[18:42:39] <Fishbowne> why is it gross /  it works ?  and solves cross domain issues.
[18:42:56] <Fishbowne> whats sol elegant about divs and ajax ?
[18:43:12] <Fishbowne> same difference if you ask me.
[18:43:13] <duch_kazatel> because iframes are loading up a completely seperate document wthin your document.
[18:43:35] <Fishbowne> yes but that is another bonus... if you want to scrape sites... you dont have to with CSS overrides.
[18:43:37] <itisi> jsonp also solves cross domain
[18:43:44] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[18:43:49] <Fishbowne> dont have to deal
[18:44:21] <duch_kazatel> <object> was support to replace iframes, and forcing the end user to load a second valid document like that is a little much.
[18:44:53] <duch_kazatel> *support = supposed
[18:45:00] <Fishbowne> right so why not use the leftover vestigal iframe for returning data ?
[18:45:01] <testing22> anyone know the best way to get the highest numeric index of a input array? i.e. form[foo][options][0] form[foo][options][1] form[foo][options][5]   would be 5
[18:45:16] <testing22> e.g.*
[18:45:34] <kansai> duch_kazatel:  did u ever use raspberry pi ?
[18:45:40] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[18:45:59] <Fishbowne> still not sure why iframes are gross.
[18:46:15] <s34n> testing22: form[foo][options].length?
[18:46:20] <duch_kazatel> because you're forcing the end user to load a second page into the first page.
[18:46:24] <duch_kazatel> the entire thing.
[18:46:28] <duch_kazatel> unnecessarily.
[18:46:43] <duch_kazatel> lots of overhead just to fetch some data.
[18:46:45] <Fishbowne> yeah but you are doing the same thing essentially ajax.
[18:46:53] <Fishbowne> well okay fair enough on the overhead.
[18:46:57] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[18:47:09] <Fishbowne> however, have never ran the two side by side for comparison.
[18:47:24] <s34n> duch_kazatel: how is that different than an ajax request?
[18:47:25] <testing22> s34n: the indexes may or may not be sorted, so that wouldn't work. these are input names e.g. <input name="form[foo][options][1]" >
[18:47:32] <Fishbowne> thank you s34n.
[18:47:52] <Fishbowne> im just saying everyone has been gaga over ajax, when iframes+javascript essentially already did the same thing. more or less.
[18:47:58] <Fishbowne> plus no cross domain issues.
[18:48:16] <duch_kazatel> s34n iframes have to reference completely valid source documents.
[18:48:21] <duch_kazatel> so they need to be well formed html pages.
[18:48:25] <duch_kazatel> doctype, head, body, etc.
[18:48:26] <Fishbowne> duch... not true.
[18:48:36] <Fishbowne> you can return plain text
[18:48:40] <s34n> duch_kazatel: huh? since when?
[18:49:07] <duch_kazatel> you *can* but it's not valid.
[18:49:13] <s34n> duch_kazatel: they could be images, text, json, malformed html, ...
[18:49:20] <Fishbowne> they could be anything.
[18:49:23] <duch_kazatel> and frames are getting ditched in favor of <object> anyway.
[18:49:31] <duch_kazatel> they "can" sure, but I prefer valid code.
[18:49:50] <Fishbowne> 6 of one, 1/2 dozen of the other I say.
[18:50:02] <Fishbowne> +no cross domain issues.
[18:50:10] <s34n> duch_kazatel: you're not making sense. there are no guarantees that your ajax response is valid html
[18:50:15] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.cakemail.com/the-iframe-cross-domain-policy-problem/
[18:50:24] <duch_kazatel> :)
[18:50:32] <Fishbowne> now hes just googling til he finds a response :D
[18:50:37] <duch_kazatel> right, becausemy ajax response can be anything.
[18:50:52] <s34n> duch_kazatel: so can you iframe content
[18:50:53] <duch_kazatel> and no, i'm showing an example that shows that iframes aren't great anymnore.
[18:51:08] <duch_kazatel> feel free to do things that way.
[18:51:14] <Fishbowne> so you think youtube will go object then ?
[18:51:19] <Fishbowne> <object> ?
[18:51:35] <duch_kazatel> depends on when html5 video stops being a redheaded stepchild
[18:51:40] <shoky> s34n: try your ajax request in chrome. see if you get something in the console
[18:51:47] <s34n> I personally prefer ajax. But duch_kazatel's arguments don't refute iframes
[18:52:08] <duch_kazatel> then why do you prefer ajax?
[18:52:17] <Fishbowne> s34n, I agree. im still using ajax here as well, but iframes are a quick and dirty alternative.
[18:52:22] <Fishbowne> like <center></center>
[18:52:29] <Fishbowne> :D
[18:52:30] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[18:52:36] <duch_kazatel> so i say it's dirty, and I'm wrong.
[18:52:45] <duch_kazatel> but if you say the word "dirty" it's OK?
[18:52:59] <duch_kazatel> lol good times.
[18:53:05] <Fishbowne> im just saying long before ajax, you could have easily reloaded iframes off screen.
[18:53:11] <Fishbowne> and you still can today.
[18:53:15] <duch_kazatel> sure, and now we have a better way to do that :)
[18:53:17] <duch_kazatel> either way i gotta head home.  enjoy folks.
[18:53:25] <Fishbowne> as well as using <CENTER> tags.
[18:54:26] <Fishbowne> how is centering better these days ?
[18:54:30] <Fishbowne> I hate CSS centering.
[18:54:36] <Fishbowne> its gETTING BeTTER with CSS3.
[18:54:53] <Fishbowne> I have seen PLENTY Of pro sites still resortin to <center>
[18:55:00] <Fishbowne> resorting to
[18:55:09] <shoky> can you name 2?
[18:55:21] <Fishbowne> not off the top of my head.
[18:55:24] <shoky> ok
[18:56:11] <s34n> shoky: doh! thanks
[18:56:24] <Fishbowne> at least center was guranteed to work before CSS3.
[18:56:33] <s34n> shoky: I don't know why firefox shows 200 OK
[18:56:36] <Fishbowne> instead of confusing the crap out of everyone.
[18:57:06] <shoky> s34n: yep we were just complaining about that a couple of hours ago ;p
[18:58:08] <s34n> Fishbowne: please don't complain about the inadequacies of html/css/etc. You could crowd out the channel with grievances
[18:58:15] <Fishbowne> fair enough.
[18:58:21] <s34n> We all know it's still lousy
[18:58:35] <Fishbowne> I get the separation of content vs. description etc.
[18:58:43] <s34n> but maybe you don't remember 15 years ago
[18:59:08] <Fishbowne> I remember.
[18:59:23] <s34n> Fishbowne: if things were ideal, we wouldn't need jquery
[18:59:26] <shoky> s34n: the 200 OK makes some sense because firefox does actually get a 200 OK. but then it doesnt see the CORS header so it aborts. and doesnt let you know about it ;[
[19:00:02] <Fishbowne> Ive never understood why there were not two different flavors of HTML...  1 Interpreted and the other Specfic... i think CSS "TRIES" to accomplish the latter.
[19:00:17] <shoky> huh
[19:00:26] <Fishbowne> instead it was just decided that it would be interprested, and the rest is history.
[19:12:13] <yellowfish> b
[19:36:49] <dreamingrainbow> can some one help me turn this http://jsbin.com/EMONaJo  into an ajax request
[19:37:18] <relipse> is it possible to do $('td#mytd').onhtmlchange() that gets called each time the inner html changes?

[19:39:02] <Rout> i need a simple jquery code, that when click on button, change the class of div 3
[19:39:55] <Rout> But, i dont have only 1 of this divs,,,
[19:47:42] <Rout> someone here?
[19:48:01] * Velveeta hears a sound scurry through the darkness in the corner of the room.
[19:48:18] * Velveeta jumps behind Rout and says "I think i heard someoneâ€¦â€¦â€¦ over there!"
[19:49:25] <Velveeta> rout: so, do you need help setting the class of the next sibling div, or of specifically class 3?
[19:49:45] <Rout> specifically class 3
[19:50:26] <Velveeta> dreamingrainbow: that's just a javascript object.. are you saying you want to fetch that object via an ajax request?
[19:50:55] <Velveeta> rout: but only the specific instance of class 3 that happens to be in the same container (class 1) as the button (class 2) that was clicked on?
[19:52:10] <dreamingrainbow> I would like to use php to fill the var with json and ajax but im not sure how to format the jquery
[19:52:33] <Rout> Yes, i have three divs class 1, And when i click on button, should only hide the brother who was chosen
[19:52:34] <Velveeta> do you have a php function ready to output that json to a browser?
[19:52:45] <Velveeta> and you just need help knowing how to structure the ajax request to fetch it?
[19:53:00] <Rout> i dont think i need ajax,
[19:53:07] <Velveeta> rout: that was for dreamingrainbow
[19:53:16] <Rout> a ok. sorry
[19:53:49] <Velveeta> rout: for you, you can try something like this: $('.class2').on('click', function () { $(this).siblings('.class3').addClass('whatever-new-class-you-want-to-add'); });
[19:54:11] <Velveeta> or rather, that should be like $('.class2 button')
[20:01:46] <Rout> Velveeta: sorry i think dont work, take a look on my real html http://pastebin.com/WsAtmznP
[20:02:39] <Velveeta> rout: ok, you're right, i overlooked something with my original example, try this instead:
[20:02:41] <Rout> and i tryied this jquery $('.painel').on('click', function () { $(this).siblings('.painel-body').addClass('hide'); });
[20:03:40] <Velveeta> $('.panel-title .btn').on('click', function () { $(this).closest('.header').find('.panel-body').addClass('whatever-class-you-want-to-add'); });
[20:04:26] <Rout> ok
[20:04:28] <Rout> i will try
[20:04:28] <Rout> thx
[20:05:06] <Velveeta> no problemo
[20:08:19] <Zak> whats a good way to modify css stylesheets via jquery?
[20:08:54] <Zak> ah geez. Nevermind, I found something again
[20:09:05] <Zak> i gotta look through google more carefully
[20:09:07] <Zak> fyi: https://github.com/f0r4y312/jquery-stylesheet
[20:10:32] <Rout> Velveeta: sorry but i think isn't working, http://pastebin.com/u68ccHsF
[20:10:34] <Rout> look again
[20:11:19] <Velveeta> zak: also, you shouldn't be modifying stylesheets themselves w/ javascript
[20:11:35] <Velveeta> you should be applying your css rules with classes that apply more specificity
[20:11:47] <Zak> why's that?
[20:12:24] <Zak> sorry, back up for a bit
[20:12:28] <Velveeta> because it's bad practice in generalâ€¦ stylesheets are a static resource
[20:12:44] <Zak> i'm not that interested in modifying stylesheet but rather adding and removing them dynamically
[20:12:46] <Velveeta> you should know when debugging them that what you see is what was generated by the server for output to your client
[20:13:00] <Zak> and my use case is fairly specific because this is for LESS
[20:13:06] <Velveeta> as opposed to something that may or may not exist on the server, and may or may not have been created programmatically after the page loaded
[20:13:17] <Zak> yeah, that's exactly what LESS is doing
[20:13:24] <Velveeta> i use less myself, but that's beside the point
[20:13:38] <Velveeta> less is compiling to static css which is shipped from your server, it's a markdown language
[20:13:47] <Velveeta> it's not altering the css after it goes out the door to the browser
[20:13:54] <Zak> well, it is sort of
[20:14:06] <Rout> Velveeta: when u have time, take a look on my paste.
[20:14:07] <Zak> it has that capability via modifyVars
[20:14:07] <Velveeta> well, it's not sort of
[20:14:21] <Zak> and its in the browser.js portion of the code-base
[20:14:23] <Velveeta> those still compile down to static css that's output to the client
[20:14:42] <Zak> no.. you need to look at modifyVars
[20:14:44] <Zak> it runs client-side
[20:15:00] <Zak> the compilation happens client-side too
[20:15:06] <Zak> and css stylesheets are replaced on the fly
[20:15:26] <Zak> there's a big disclaimer to all of this
[20:15:44] <Velveeta> zak: are you doing client-side compilation of your less markdown?
[20:15:49] <Zak> the usage of client-side compilation using LESS in production, isn't really supported by LESS, but they're very vague about it
[20:16:05] <Zak> Velveeta: that's the problem i'm trying to tackle now
[20:16:21] <Zak> and yes, i'm aware of the multiple issues with it
[20:16:23] <Velveeta> i stick by my disclaimer that it's bad practice
[20:16:35] <Zak> which is why i'm trying to fix it
[20:17:01] <Zak> i've got some perfectly good solutions to solving it
[20:17:04] <Velveeta> rout: i don't see anything wrong with the way you have that function handler written, what's it actually doing? can you create a jsfiddle exampel to demonstrate?
[20:17:19] <Zak> the part i'm just trying to figure out right now, is figuring out the best approach to switching in/out stylesheets
[20:17:27] <Zak> i don't really need to modify them
[20:17:32] <Rout> ok i will try
[20:17:53] <Zak> i could continue to use what's already there, but i just wanted to do some research first
[20:18:11] <Zak> this is one of the "obscure" issues that somebody ran into: https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/163
[20:19:03] <Zak> so yeah, if anybody is aware of any other libraries that are adding/replacing/removing stylesheets dynamically, i would be much appreciated to know about them
[20:20:13] <Velveeta> zak: skimming through that github page, i'd say they're hitting on the same point as me, that it's bad practice and isn't a supported feature.. i don't think i'd call that a bug so much as someone using the software in a way it's not meant to be used ;)
[20:20:34] <Rout> velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/n8BFa/
[20:20:36] <Rout> take a look
[20:20:38] <Rout> isnt working
[20:20:43] <Zak> Velveeta: honestly, it's only not supported because it's been put in the "too hard" basket
[20:20:49] <Zak> but yeah, that's my opinion about it
[20:21:04] <Zak> i'm seriously looking at supporting/fixing bugs around less.js in production
[20:21:05] <Velveeta> it's in the "too hard" basket because the browser support for it is spotty at best
[20:21:18] <Rout> Velveeta: it's the gray circle, the button
[20:21:33] <Velveeta> you can't write a utility to be used by a browser, and force it to make the browser's code comply with what you want it to do if it just plain doesn't support that functionality
[20:22:25] <Zak> Velveeta: fair call, but i don't think adding stylesheets dynamically is that big a deal
[20:22:38] <Zak> most of the mainstream browsers deal with it fine
[20:22:51] <Zak> and there's nothing wrong with having a library that is only supported on limited platforms
[20:23:00] <Zak> provided those platforms are communicated
[20:23:26] <Velveeta> rout: you didn't include jquery in that fiddle, i popped it in and it's now alerting: http://jsfiddle.net/n8BFa/1/
[20:24:44] <Rout> Velveeta: but take a look, isnt' hiding http://jsfiddle.net/n8BFa/1/
[20:25:20] <Rout> sorry, my bad, it's working =)
[20:25:28] <Velveeta> :)
[20:29:00] <Rout> Velveeta: hey, sorry i'm using jquery 1.7.2 and dont work
[20:29:00] <Rout> why?
[20:33:50] <Velveeta> not sure, is it throwing an error of some kind?
[20:41:41] <Rout> Velveeta: are u there? the code work to hide... but not to show, i tryied to make the reverse
[20:41:50] <Rout> but dont work, are u there?
[20:42:34] <Rout> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/gdMvTHvh i'm trying this
[20:43:12] <Velveeta> oh yeah, instead of adding the hide class, you should toggle it
[20:43:20] <Velveeta> use .toggleClass('hide') instead of .addClass()
[20:43:57] <Rout> ok i will try
[20:45:15] <Rout> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/RwHg0swM but the glyph part isn't working
[20:45:29] <Rout> isn't changing
[20:47:59] <Velveeta> oh, well that's the wrong use of toggleClass thereâ€¦ there you should be doing something like: $(this).removeClass('glyphicon-chevron-down').addClass('glyphicon-chevron-up'); in your down click handler, and the reverse of that in your up click handler
[20:50:09] <Rout> Velveeta: isn't working good, when i click for show content again, dont add the class
[20:50:11] <Rout> take a lok:
[20:50:22] <Rout> http://pastebin.com/QjNB7Bmw
[20:51:29] <Rout> the class chevron up, dont change
[20:52:44] <Velveeta> you should make a jsfiddle example out of it so i can help modify the code
[20:54:41] <Rout> i fix it
[20:54:46] <Rout> its working on this way

[21:13:12] <seanz> Greetings. Does anyone here have experience uploading just *part* of a file using Javascript?
[21:24:43] <Mitranim> Hi all, are noobish questions tolerated? (Are they also answered, for that matter...) :D
[21:25:02] <raj> yep :)
[21:25:07] <Mitranim> Great
[21:25:22] <Mitranim> I'm reading Tabs documentation and trying to figure out how to apply options to specific tabs
[21:25:38] <Mitranim> The docs only mention that you can e.g. choose a particular tab to activate first
[21:25:44] <Mitranim> While the options always apply to everything
[21:25:57] <Mitranim> Is it even possible to apply them selectively per tab?
[21:27:20] <Mitranim> Like e.g. make them slide in different directions when activating
[21:27:27] <raj> oh, I see
[21:27:34] <Mitranim> Or display different placeholders beforeLoad on different tabs
[21:27:45] <raj> to tell you the truth, I just created my own tabs because I found it too difficult to make jqui's tabs do what I wanted
[21:27:51] <Mitranim> =/
[21:28:40] <raj> I found most things to be possible with jqui's tabs, but very difficult to implement
[21:28:51] <Mitranim> Hmm, what was hard to implement?
[21:29:27] <raj> stuff like you're mentioning
[21:29:33] <raj> sortability, etc
[21:30:57] <Mitranim> Sad
[21:31:24] <raj> I was sad at first too
[21:31:28] <raj> now I'm very happy
[21:31:50] <raj> making my own tabs was a great decision
[21:32:06] <Mitranim> How long it took?
[21:33:07] <raj> 2hrs a day for a few days
[21:43:10] <raj> can I make one of the keys in .data() of a parent depend on the .data() of a child?
[21:48:39] <raj> so everytime the child's .data() is updated, the parent's .data() is also updated?
[21:49:06] <Mitranim> I suppose you could make a handler for data updates
[21:49:32] <Mitranim> If that's even possible
[21:49:48] <raj> sounds like I'll have to do it the old fashioned way
[21:55:59] <Mitranim> Damn I'm trying to target a panel element in a tab on beforeLoad and can't figure out how to refer to that element from ui.tab and / or ui.panel
[21:56:31] <Mitranim> They are supposed to be jQuery objects but calls like .html() return undefined
[21:56:33] <Mitranim> So what gives...
[22:01:37] <raj> Mitranim, got a link or demo?
[22:02:35] <Mitranim> http://mitranim-test.appspot.com/
[22:02:40] <Mitranim> Open console and switch to second tab
[22:03:03] <Mitranim> It calls console.log($(ui.panel)) and console.log($(ui.panel).html()) on beforeLoad and load
[22:04:05] <raj> there's no ui.tab
[22:04:10] <Mitranim> Yeah
[22:04:20] <Mitranim> I tried both
[22:04:28] <Mitranim> ui.panel is supposed to be where the actual content is
[22:04:31] <ajpiano> Mitranim: the first arg supplied to those callbacks is an event object
[22:04:33] <ajpiano> not the ui obj
[22:04:39] <ajpiano> load: function(event, ui) { }
[22:04:49] <Mitranim> So I must put event there too?
[22:04:51] <Mitranim> Interesting
[22:04:52] <ajpiano> yea
[22:04:54] <Mitranim> Didn't realise that
[22:04:55] <Mitranim> Thanks
[22:05:00] <raj> nice timing ajpiano
[22:05:05] <ajpiano> you can't just magically rename the arguments by only pickin the one you want, they're still supplied ordinally
[22:05:23] <Mitranim> Damn, good to know
[22:05:33] <ajpiano> `tmyk
[22:05:37] <Mitranim> Aha, NOW it works
[22:05:43] <Mitranim> Priceless
[22:05:50] <ajpiano> time for bed :)
[22:07:44] <snover> ajpiano: stop taking the magic out of life
[22:45:57] <Zak> "magic happens"
