[04:11:38] <Dro> Hello, how can I format a number 1000000 like this 1 000 000 with JS ?
[04:18:50] <Cork> Dro: you have to use a script or lib that does that, the language doesn't have anything built in
[04:20:01] <Cork> but ex .toString().replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+$)/g, '$1 ') is an option
[04:20:27] <Cork> (there are a ton of dedicated libs for this out there)
[04:24:37] <Dro> Cork: thank you!
[07:11:16] <Rockwood> how to disable link to avoid for next click --> https://jsfiddle.net/fy6f081c/
[07:11:45] <Cork> handle it in the click handler
[07:12:15] <Cork> $(this).off();
[07:42:11] <Rockwood> thanks Cork
[08:56:52] <anddam> howdy
[08:57:10] <anddam> I'm trying to use this timeline component https://github.com/CodyHouse/horizontal-timeline , that creates an horizontal timeline offsetting the item in it according to their time-distance
[08:58:07] <anddam> I'd like to override that logic in https://github.com/CodyHouse/horizontal-timeline/blob/master/js/main.js#L130 and have something based on element widths, but I see that the ones I get with .width() are way different than the rendered widths
[08:59:23] <anddam> just adding     console.log(timelineComponents['timelineEvents'].eq(i).width());    in the for loop in that functions will show the issue
[09:00:00] <anddam> can I load the example in jsfiddle or the like in order to show it more easily?
[09:00:07] <anddam> I mean load the whole file structure and all
[09:04:52] <Cork> anddam: have a look at outerWidth() or outerWidth(true)
[10:49:41] <albert> hi
[10:51:19] <albert> I looked over the internet for solution of my problem, but I didn't find anything, so I looked for IRC channel - so here I am.
[10:53:06] <Cork> albert: if you have a question you need to ask it
[10:53:12] <albert> The problem is that I have form with dynamically adjustable row numbers - that works well. Problem is,
[10:54:06] <albert> Problem is that I have two select inputs and I want one select on change will select another one too. but only in that row.
[10:54:31] <anddam> Cork: I checked that as well, I think either something's altering the elements after the script has run or it's referring different elements
[10:54:35] <Cork> albert: make a jsfiddle showing what you're trying to do
[10:54:52] <anddam> is there a easy way I can load an entire folder structure to jsfiddle?
[10:54:54] <albert> one second please :)
[11:03:04] <albert> https://jsfiddle.net/vps815ok/
[11:03:15] <albert> I think its the link
[11:06:35] <albert> I was trying to use this().next() to select correct select, but it didn't work. Worst thing is that debug of chrome don't display any problem. It just doesn't work. I'm not very good in JS and jQuery just starting.
[11:14:32] <albert> Cork: did you maybe looked at my code?
[11:29:12] <anddam> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/5cuc1pbx/5/ see L135 in the js, I'm reading 24 for all four ".events a" elements in console, while the rendered anchor are way different in size
[11:29:22] <anddam> any hint?
[11:31:54] <shoky> albert: https://jsfiddle.net/vps815ok/1/
[11:33:37] <albert> shoky: thanks - it works :)
[13:16:39] <zludebr> Hello! Can someone help me know to move this div using jquery animate to be the same speed no matter the distance between the clicks? Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/RnsDg/225/
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:17:30] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want consistent velocity.
[13:17:45] <zludebr> Yes! when you click far from the div it goes fast
[13:17:54] <zludebr> When you click closer to the div it goes slow
[13:18:11] <zludebr> how to get consistent velocity.
[13:18:27] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3191358/jquery-animation-speed
[13:18:43] <robertmaxrees> specifically https://stackoverflow.com/a/3191391/923919
[13:18:49] <robertmaxrees> which explains the issue and gives an answer :)
[13:21:59] <zludebr> i'll try! thanks
[13:22:20] <zludebr> but by only using 'linear' doesnt change anything
[13:23:55] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:23:56] <robertmaxrees> right./
[13:24:09] <robertmaxrees> the issue has to do with the fact that your duration is constant.
[13:24:25] <robertmaxrees> it's going to take 1 second to get wherever, regardless of distance.
[13:24:34] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to build up a calculation to change that.
[13:25:48] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/27791287/923919 this gives you the basic formula to work with.
[13:26:36] <pdub> Whats up with the jQuery organization?  Is the market just headed away from there and they can't keep up in terms of resources & maintainers?
[13:27:02] <pdub> Was reading -- https://www.infoworld.com/article/3244647/open-source-tools/troubled-jquery-mobile-and-ui-projects-seek-new-participants.html
[13:28:07] <pdub> cool stuff going on at JS Foundation though -- https://js.foundation/community/projects
[13:29:04] <robertmaxrees> pdub it's a little more complex than that.
[13:29:22] <pdub> robertmaxrees: i imagine so, but seeking a concise summary :P
[13:29:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:29:38] <robertmaxrees> that's the issue - there isn't one.
[13:29:49] <pdub> robertmaxrees: i mean, i love jquery.  i just wonder where it's going-- will it fade away? it seems too useful to fade away.
[13:30:01] <pdub> I guess it will keep evolving...
[13:30:05] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[13:30:18] <pdub> with influences from other frameworks in the ecosystem
[13:31:54] <robertmaxrees> people like to say it's "dead", but that would ignore the fact that it's still got a huge number of installs.
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> that combined with the articles that say "you don't need jquery" have both contributed to this perception.
[13:34:42] <robertmaxrees> i know that jqui and jmobile both had some really good ideas in the pipe, but the lack of resources make getting that stuff kind of difficult.
[13:40:25] <zludebr> no idea how to apply that to the coordinates things
[13:43:01] <robertmaxrees> zludebr so think of it this way
[13:43:17] <robertmaxrees> the time is pixels / desired pixels per second, right?

[14:04:24] <RabSimpson> Hi folks, I'm trying to feed an array of parameters into .bxslider but the carousel won't play. I know I'm doing something stupid to stop it working, but I can't see what it is. Here's my url: https://www.stonebanktravel.co.uk/?bypasss_=1 Any ideas?
[14:04:58] <RabSimpson> Sorry, bxslider()
[14:05:12] <robertmaxrees> RabSimpson where's the relevant code?
[14:05:16] <robertmaxrees> don't wanna go digging around.
[14:05:33] <RabSimpson> robertmaxrees: Sorry, it's in carousel.js
[14:06:00] <RabSimpson> It works when I use the options within the function directly, but not when I pass it as a var
[14:06:32] <RabSimpson> I'm a moron
[14:06:42] <RabSimpson> I knew I'd see it as soon as I posted here
[14:06:50] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:06:51] <RabSimpson> It was the curly braces within bxslider()
[14:07:12] <RabSimpson> D'oh! :P
[14:07:29] <robertmaxrees> happens to the best of us.
[14:07:57] <RabSimpson> robertmaxrees: I started drinking too early today ;)
[14:08:26] <robertmaxrees> it
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> *it's all good.
[15:05:14] <Levin^> hello
[15:05:36] <taplar> domo
[15:05:44] <Levin^> ^^
[15:06:15] <Levin^> I have this code where I'm trying to make the menu to scroll horizontally as the user navigates through the page
[15:06:33] <Levin^> but it's not looking well good yet
[15:06:47] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/WJJELW
[15:07:33] <Levin^> I wanted the highlighted menu item to touch the left side of its container everytime it changes from one item to another
[15:07:56] <Levin^> but after a while that doesn't happen
[15:13:10] <taplar> I'm not sure I can help much with this.  The codepen doesn't seem to do anything for me.
[15:13:44] <taplar> ooh, it does if i actually try to scroll down
[15:13:56] <Levin^> yea
[15:14:32] <taplar> well, i mean the ability to scroll left is usually dependent upon the width of the container
[15:14:48] <Levin^> I think the problem if the scrollLeft, is that right?
[15:15:00] <taplar> another way to do that though would be to apply a position to it, and change the left or right property
[15:15:51] <taplar> hmmm
[15:22:57] <taplar> well, same issue, but i've reduced your code quite a bit.  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jxXmMG?editors=1010
[15:31:06] <taplar> Levin^: got it
[15:31:43] <taplar> refresh that codepen.  you have to account for the amount you've already scrolled right
[15:36:27] <Levin^> hmm
[15:36:30] <Levin^> :)
[15:36:53] <Levin^> nice, you made it work!
[15:36:57] <Levin^> let me read it
[15:40:04] <Levin^> ohh, it seems the lines 35 and 36 are the key to make it work, right?
[15:40:19] <Levin^> scrollLeft: $container.scrollLeft() + $target.offset().left
[15:40:28] <taplar> yes
[15:40:51] <Levin^> I was thinking the right way to make it read it correctly
[15:41:02] <Levin^> thanks :)
[16:02:06] <arup_r> Why do I get No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8000' is therefore not allowed access. error from https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/1884f3f1d2711def00100b5b5872f595
[16:03:13] <taplar> Your script is not being executed from https://maps.googleapis.com
[16:03:27] <taplar> And apparently they are not allowing offsite ajax requests to that domain
[16:04:59] <taplar> "If you wish to force a crossDomain request (such as JSONP) on the same domain, set the value of crossDomain to true. This allows, for example, server-side redirection to another domain. (version added: 1.5)"
[16:05:32] <taplar> This doesn't do anything for you as you are not staying on the same domain
[16:08:43] <arup_r> ok
[16:08:56] <arup_r> but if I hit the url to browser I see the reponse..
[16:09:04] <arup_r> only from script it doesn't happen
[16:09:07] <taplar> because that's not a cross origin request
[16:09:12] <arup_r> hm
[16:09:29] <arup_r> so no way to make it work using script as i have now?
[16:09:44] <arup_r> like adding some config..? not sure so asking
[16:09:59] <arup_r> I understand the problem.. but not able to figure out how to solve
[16:10:09] <taplar> i'm not familiar with the google api.  given that it is an api (i'm guessing by the /api in the url), i would assume there is a way for you to make ajax requests to them.  I just don't have the info as to how.
[16:11:07] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19962498/ajax-and-google-places-api-getting-json
[16:11:59] <taplar> ok, so it looks like it supports jsonp
[16:12:05] <taplar> from their documentation
[16:12:50] <arup_r> can you give me the link jsonp?
[16:14:21] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-addressform
[16:14:43] <taplar> at the bottom they have a url in a script tag that is passing a callback parameter.  that signifies a jsonp request
[16:17:37] <arup_r> ok
[16:17:50] <taplar> actually that's a different endpoint
[16:18:15] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search   I don't see the callback option in there, so that one may not do jsonp.  But there's the documentation for them
[16:25:33] <taplar> arup_r: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19975016/ajax-and-places-api-get-request may be what you are after.
[16:34:29] <taplar> Something just occurred to me as well.
[16:34:35] <taplar> but he's gone...
[16:46:23] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[16:46:52] <taplar> lol
[16:47:08] <taplar> it occurred to me that he's providing a google key and the url associated with that key is most likely not localhost
[16:48:06] <robertmaxrees> hah.  of course.
[16:49:01] <taplar> cause I was like, man, he's brave sharing his key out to the chat room.......   wait, it would be public on his source code..... what tha..... OOOOOOHHHH
[16:49:33] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:49:40] <taplar> herp derp
[16:49:55] <robertmaxrees> there was a particular person giving out their private API keys for some API in ##javascript the other day,.
[16:49:56] <Levin^> lol
[16:50:39] <Levin^> what terrible thing could happen
[16:51:37] <robertmaxrees> they could cut off your access.
[16:52:07] <taplar> heh, i mean your key is essentially your identifier.  you're telling others how to identify as you
[16:52:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:52:39] <robertmaxrees> if you were building an app that had permissions to, say, edit user info on a service, those keys are for the whole castle.
[16:56:51] <Buoy172> I have a selector like this: const $items = $('.item'); and there are many items like: <div class="item">one</div><div class="item">two</div> etc
[16:57:06] <Buoy172> how do I find an item based on the text it contains?
[16:57:16] <Buoy172> What do I do? $items.find(....) ?????
[16:57:17] <robertmaxrees> .filter()
[16:57:25] <robertmaxrees> .find() is for descendent elements
[16:57:32] <robertmaxrees> .filter() will filter down the current set.
[16:57:50] <robertmaxrees> .filter(function() { return $(this).text() === 'foo' });
[16:57:59] <Buoy172> let me try...
[16:59:11] <Buoy172> robertmaxrees, I just need to find the first element
[16:59:43] <taplar> multiple of them have the same inner text?
[17:00:29] <robertmaxrees> Buoy172 then why did you say "based on the text it contains"?
[17:00:33] <Buoy172> yeah, actually I'm going to use startsWith(), and it will match multiple
[17:00:38] <robertmaxrees> do you need the first element that contains certain text?
[17:00:51] <taplar> ok, so even then, you can just do get(0) or [0] or eq(0) off of it
[17:00:56] <Buoy172> let's say the first element that starts with 'c'
[17:01:01] <robertmaxrees> ^ depending on your needs.
[17:06:42] <taplar> you know I find bread and fruit juice to be very relaxing
[17:06:55] <taplar> you know, just roll with the punches
[17:07:47] <robertmaxrees> jfc
[17:07:49] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[17:07:54] <robertmaxrees> you'd do well at my company hahahahahaha
[17:08:21] <taplar> it's been one of those days
[17:09:26] <taplar> let me see if i can find this article
[17:29:18] <Buoy172> If I have a selector that selects multiple items how do I get nth item?
[17:29:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:29:30] <robertmaxrees> the same way you get the 1st
[17:29:53] <Buoy172> like $($items.eq(15)) ?
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> aye
[17:30:12] <taplar> without the double wrap
[17:30:19] <taplar> eq() returns a jQuery object already
[17:30:36] <Buoy172> you sure?
[17:30:45] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:30:45] <taplar> 100%
[17:30:57] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[17:31:18] <taplar> that's the difference between get() and eq()
[17:31:19] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/RMmcPHC.png
[17:32:58] <Buoy172> thanks guys
[17:33:25] <Buoy172> (if you are guys, I don't want to look sexist)
[17:33:26] <Buoy172> hehe
[17:33:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:47:32] <Buoy172> I have this: const options = $items.map((index, element) => $(element).text().toLowerCase());
[17:48:02] <Buoy172> but then options.findIndex(...) throws an error: "options.findIndex is not a function"
[17:48:04] <Buoy172> wtf?
[17:48:33] <Buoy172> options IS an array with many elements, I'm 100% sure
[17:50:33] <pavonia> $items is a jQuery object?
[17:53:10] <Buoy172> pavonia: yes
[17:53:34] <pavonia> So the result is another jQuery object, not an array
[17:55:00] <pavonia> options.get().findIndex(...) is probably what you want
[17:58:28] <Buoy172> pavonia, how do I make options not be a jQuery object
[17:58:30] <taplar> options is also a jQuery object
[17:58:34] <Buoy172> can't use 'map' ?
[17:58:47] <taplar> put get() on the end of it
[17:58:52] <Buoy172> I want 'options' to be a regular array of strings
[17:59:10] <Buoy172> So, you're saying: const options = $items.map((index, element) => $(element).text().toLowerCase()).get(); ????
[17:59:15] <taplar> yep
[18:00:17] <taplar> jQuery.fn.map returns a jQuery object as it's result
[18:00:24] <taplar> jQuery.map returns an array
[18:00:28] <Buoy172> thank you all, that worked!
[18:04:07] <taplar> Buoy172: also $(element).text().toLowerCase() could also probably just be element.innerHTML.toLowerCase()
[18:04:24] <taplar> saves a jQuery object creation and following method call
[18:05:20] <robertmaxrees> though there are some minor differences to be aware of if you have childNodes
[18:05:55] <taplar> I feel like there is also an innerText property?  *goes to google*
[18:06:03] <robertmaxrees> there is.
[18:06:07] <robertmaxrees> but still the same issue iirc.
[18:06:13] <robertmaxrees> could have that wrong.
[18:07:45] <taplar> oooh, innerText has issues in IE 10-11 with placeholders
[18:07:53] <robertmaxrees> that was it.
[18:08:02] <taplar> fkn IE
[18:08:37] <taplar> we've had to do backend checks for stuff like that before cause IE would submit placeholders as the input value
[18:09:18] <kevr> i'm trying to use jquery to change the src of an image dynamically for a loading state
[18:09:25] <kevr> but it doesn't seem to be loading the image i'm switching to
[18:09:33] <robertmaxrees> kevr how are you setting the src?
[18:09:34] <kevr> is there some type of refresh of DOM i need to do or something?
[18:09:38] <kevr> like this:
[18:09:51] <kevr> jQuery("#blah").prop("src", "blah.jpg");
[18:09:54] <kevr> i tried with .attr as well
[18:09:59] <kevr> they both kinda gave me the same results
[18:10:06] <robertmaxrees> "kinda"?
[18:10:10] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab?
[18:10:14] <kevr> well, they do to my eyes, but
[18:10:17] <kevr> sure
[18:10:19] <kevr> sec
[18:10:30] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's an issue with the image path.
[18:10:37] <kevr> OH
[18:10:39] <taplar> is blah.jpg in the same directory as the page you are viewing?
[18:10:39] <kevr> I know what's happening
[18:10:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:10:58] <kevr> it's not the image path, it happens that the trigger that causes this is putting the server down that has this image
[18:11:00] <kevr> heh
[18:11:02] <kevr> dumb
[18:11:04] <kevr> thanks for the network tab suggestion
[18:11:14] <taplar> keep that guy open while you develop
[18:11:16] <robertmaxrees> hahahahhaaha
[18:11:21] <kevr> :P
[18:11:34] <taplar> console/network tab + debugger; <-- best friends
[18:11:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:11:45] <kevr> usually my console is always up
[18:11:50] <robertmaxrees> also: assume you've made the simplest mistake at all times.
[18:11:53] <kevr> but i only look at the network tab when im trying to troubleshoot headers or some such
[18:11:56] <robertmaxrees> can't tell you how many times that's saved me.
[18:11:59] <kevr> :P
[18:12:10] <taplar> yeah, 90% of debugging is questioning assumptions
[18:12:16] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[18:13:43] <robertmaxrees> my favorite example of that was this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2LtasL6f/
[18:13:53] <robertmaxrees> tripped up a few of us before we saw what the issue was.
[18:14:10] <taplar> heh
[18:14:26] <kevr> that's why i like c/c++
[18:14:30] <kevr> :P
[18:14:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:14:49] <taplar> i've did c++.  I think i still prefer js
[18:14:59] <kevr> depends what you're doing really
[18:15:17] <kevr> it would be kinda stupid to write browser animations in some sort of google plugin
[18:15:28] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:15:45] <kevr> meaning, js has it's job, c/c++ has it's job
[18:15:53] <robertmaxrees> oh, sure.
[18:16:27] <taplar> i didn't mean my statement to be counter to yours.  just sharing my view.
[18:16:28] <kevr> for example, i would never build a distributed cluster application in JS over C++
[18:16:47] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd probably use a combo of the two tbh.
[18:17:08] <taplar> i'm sure someone could/has written clusters services in node
[18:17:13] <taplar> *clustered
[18:17:16] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[18:17:20] <kevr> taplar: not arguing, just talking random thoughts
[18:17:23] <kevr> my bad :P
[18:17:25] <robertmaxrees> that's one of the things it's really good at.
[18:17:32] <kevr> taplar: definitely
[18:17:34] <kevr> eh
[18:17:41] <robertmaxrees> the issue with node is that people misapply it all the time.
[18:17:43] <taplar> cool.  just so we know we're not butting heads, :D
[18:17:47] <robertmaxrees> and write monolithic apps.
[18:18:11] <kevr> it has unnecessary overhead in my opinion
[18:18:19] <robertmaxrees> how so?
[18:18:19] <kevr> ...it does get done quicker though
[18:18:52] <kevr> runtime is always gonna be slower than native, unless you do a really great job at configuring your interpreter engine
[18:19:08] <kevr> also, native programmers could screw up, given the control
[18:19:26] <taplar> are you suggesting that a node application compiles it's logic each time it is accessed?
[18:19:32] <kevr> no?
[18:19:34] <taplar> no
[18:19:38] <kevr> i'm not
[18:19:38] <taplar> just at startup
[18:19:50] <robertmaxrees> and some js applications can get near c/c++ perf.
[18:20:01] <kevr> keyword there is *some* and *near*
[18:20:05] <kevr> keywords there are*
[18:20:20] <taplar> ok, but then you have to start talking about perception
[18:20:28] <robertmaxrees> but those kinds of performance evaluations are oftne done in non real-world applications.
[18:20:30] <taplar> is the difference perceivable to the end user?
[18:20:37] <robertmaxrees> like benchmarking calls to clock()
[18:20:38] <kevr> ahhh see
[18:20:45] <kevr> thats exactly my original point
[18:21:03] <kevr> which is why something could be "the quickest" is not always the best choice
[18:21:10] <taplar> sure
[18:21:14] <robertmaxrees> ^ all about cost/benefit :)
[18:21:14] <kevr> because node and js in general has a way better programming experience, imo
[18:21:17] <kevr> yeah
[18:21:25] <robertmaxrees> hardware is cheaper than people long-term
[18:21:54] <kevr> but that's why i mention the distributed cluster idea
[18:22:06] <kevr> because when you have thousands of machines connected trying to be as quick as possible
[18:22:08] <kevr> then maybe it's a good idea
[18:22:29] <robertmaxrees> depending on the job and circumstances.
[18:22:34] <robertmaxrees> i go back to troubleshooting and bugfixing
[18:22:34] <kevr> true.
[18:22:43] <kevr> well, thanks again
[18:22:45] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:22:45] <kevr> appreciate it.
[18:22:50] <robertmaxrees> thank you for the rousing discussion :D
[18:22:55] <kevr> :)
[18:23:03] <taplar> you gave him a chub
[18:23:41] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[18:23:49] <taplar> mmmmm, HARDware.  man it's not 6pm yet....
[18:23:57] <kevr> lol
[18:24:24] <robertmaxrees> so stoked to test out my new gig recording setup this weekend!
[18:24:38] <taplar> do what?
[18:24:56] <robertmaxrees> i've been wanting to record gigs with my band for a while.
[18:25:04] <taplar> live?
[18:25:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[18:25:09] <robertmaxrees> during concerts.
[18:25:10] <taplar> ah sweet
[18:25:24] <taplar> i thought you might have meant you were setting up a personal studio
[18:25:33] <robertmaxrees> hah, i already kind of have that >.>
[18:25:57] <robertmaxrees> my home office is basically a poor man's studio.
[18:39:49] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:40:31] <taplar> evening
[18:40:47] <gambl0re> hey taplar, hows going?
[18:41:49] <taplar> pretty good, it's friday!  and I'm eyeing the pizza hut site trying to decide if I should get a calzone
[18:42:30] <taplar> at least i think they have calzones...
[18:42:46] <gambl0re> what?
[18:42:58] <taplar> pizza hut
[18:43:20] <gambl0re> what do you mean?
[18:43:33] <taplar> the pizza joint?
[18:43:46] <gambl0re> i know pizza hut
[18:44:12] <taplar> yeah, i'm just talking out loud about my web surfing
[18:44:28] <gambl0re> if i go to https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/users/me/?token={my token} in the browser, it works but if i put that exaxt same url in postman, i recieve an invalid oauth token. anyone know why this might be happening?
[18:45:18] <taplar> if you check the two requests, are the same cookies being passed?
[18:46:41] <gambl0re> how do i check that
[18:47:04] <taplar> you can look in the network console and check the request headers on the request
[18:47:20] <taplar> you have to have it open before the request is made though for it to log
[18:47:47] <robertmaxrees> https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/quickstart/#ebapi-authenticating
[18:48:20] <gambl0re> ok one sec let me check
[18:49:45] <gambl0re> what am i looking for in the header?
[18:51:22] <taplar> are you in chrome or ff?
[18:52:05] <gambl0re> chrome
[18:53:05] <taplar> Alright, so if you click on the request you should see a section show up for headers/preview/response/etc.  In the headers section there's the general, response headers, and request headers.  You can look at the request headers one to see what cookies, if any, are attached to the request, as well as the other headers
[18:53:21] <taplar> you can then do the same for postman and see what, if anything, is different/missing
[18:54:32] <taplar> but I also don't know how your token was established and what validations the service might do in relation to where the request originated from
[18:54:45] <gambl0re> taplar, https://gist.github.com/rickywid/ef0c811442864c93d19469f0cfb81153
[18:55:20] <taplar> so you got some cookies being passed, and you also have a token header
[18:56:13] <gambl0re> yes
[18:56:20] <taplar> that token header coinciding with the query param name would be a starting point for me
[18:56:37] <taplar> have you tried also passing the token as a header on the postman?
[18:56:58] <gambl0re> let me check
[18:57:24] <gambl0re> how do i do that in postman
[18:57:42] <taplar> i'm not familiar with postman, myself.  I assume there should be an option to add headers
[18:57:53] <gambl0re> there isnt
[18:58:37] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/DjJZsgA.png
[18:58:38] <gambl0re> oh damn it works
[18:58:50] <gambl0re> taplar, when i add the token in the header it works
[18:58:55] <taplar> hell yeah
[18:58:57] <gambl0re> how did you know i had to do that
[18:59:01] <taplar> and i'm leaving on that note, :D
[18:59:01] <Levin^> bye
[18:59:12] <taplar> just a guess
[18:59:16] <gambl0re> thanks taplar
[18:59:30] <taplar> if your request worked and postman didn't, the first assumption is you are not giving it all the data
[18:59:43] <taplar> usually, to me, that means cookies or headers
[18:59:48] <taplar> just from past experience
[18:59:55] <gambl0re> i see....thanks for the help. i really appreciate it.
[19:00:04] <taplar> np.  have a great weekend all
[19:00:13] <gambl0re> see you
