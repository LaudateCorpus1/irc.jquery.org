[08:29:39] <codecutter> [{…}].size is not seem to be working
[08:29:50] <Cork> .length
[08:30:19] <Cork> there is no .size in javascriåpt
[08:31:16] <codecutter> i'm sure i tried .length too
[08:31:22] <codecutter> but length works
[15:33:04] <mandude> Hello
[15:33:30] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[15:34:01] <mandude> I have a lot of inputs, each has a class like .amount. I want to do this: on .change event of any of the inputs, get the value of all the inputs, add them together, and update the id="total"
[15:34:08] <mandude> Which jquery functions would I need to use?
[15:34:48] <robertmaxrees> $() for selecting, .on() for binding the handler, and .val() to get and set any input values.
[15:35:14] <mandude> psudeocode: .amount .change function, .each(amount)
[15:35:17] <mandude> oh
[15:35:24] <mandude> I don't need to do iterate over them?
[15:35:35] <mandude> I am slightly confused as to how to think it through
[15:35:39] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:35:41] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[15:35:50] <robertmaxrees> and i'll show you - you don't want .each(), you want a .map()
[15:35:50] <mandude> hang on
[15:35:54] <mandude> Oh?
[15:35:56] <mandude> Hmm.
[15:36:09] <mandude> map runs a function on each element, what would I do, add?
[15:36:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:36:21] <mandude> ok hang on
[15:36:27] <robertmaxrees> and that's not technically what map is for ;)
[15:40:44] <robertmaxrees> having any issues?>
[15:41:45] <robertmaxrees> mandude
[15:42:39] <mandude> https://jsfiddle.net/s5j7hLyr/4/
[15:42:47] <mandude> Something like this is what I can t hink but I dunno
[15:42:54] <robertmaxrees> so that won't work for a variety of reasons :)
[15:43:04] <mandude> yeah, still thinking
[15:43:07] <robertmaxrees> so back up.
[15:43:25] <robertmaxrees> instead, get an array of all the amounts.
[15:43:28] <robertmaxrees> hence the .map()
[15:43:56] <robertmaxrees> and don't use .html() to set values.
[15:44:00] <mandude> ok
[15:44:13] <robertmaxrees> err* use .text() in this case.
[15:49:36] <robertmaxrees> so the .map() should return the input values converted to numbers, then you use .get() against the jquery object to convert it to an array, then you'll probably have to .filter() out any NaN values, then just a simple reduce.
[15:51:23] <robertmaxrees> lmk if you have any questions :)
[16:01:34] <mandude> https://jsfiddle.net/s5j7hLyr/26/
[16:01:47] <mandude> So I have no idea what you're meaning. I am not sure if I understand. But I did this
[16:01:58] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:02:13] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of issues there.
[16:03:01] <robertmaxrees> use map
[16:03:28] <mandude> i know im workin gon ti
[16:03:43] <robertmaxrees> start by getting an array of all values.
[16:05:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:05:02] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:19:23] <mandude> robertmaxrees: I will learn that on my time later, for now I have to finish the work
[16:19:27] <mandude> http://dpaste.com/1HRYTQZ I did this (shrug)
[16:19:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:19:41] <robertmaxrees> this is so easy tho.
[16:19:47] <mandude> For you!
[16:19:55] <mandude> I play guitar for 20 years
[16:19:57] <mandude> hard for you, easy for me!
[16:20:03] <taplar> actually...
[16:20:07] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[16:20:09] <mandude> hehe
[16:20:11] <mandude> shaddup!
[16:20:13] <mandude> :D
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> i've been playing guitar for 12 years my dude.
[16:20:26] <robertmaxrees> *20 years
[16:20:29] <robertmaxrees> sec
[16:20:31] <mandude> Wow, then I will use another example
[16:20:48] <robertmaxrees> lemme know you.
[16:20:53] <robertmaxrees> *show you
[16:20:56] <mandude> Let me learn you something dawg
[16:20:59] <mandude> :D
[16:21:03] <mandude> Please, show me.
[16:21:10] <mandude> I am eager to always check out fellow guitarists
[16:22:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gne3uLfr/
[16:23:13] <robertmaxrees> just gotta break it down to discrete steps.
[16:23:37] <taplar> doesn't reduce need an initial value?
[16:23:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:24:18] <robertmaxrees> why would it?
[16:24:29] <taplar> interesting, i'm used to doing reduce(function, 0) or the like
[16:24:31] <mandude> hm.
[16:24:36] <mandude> That is beyond my mind right now
[16:24:39] <mandude> Too much noob
[16:24:47] <robertmaxrees> lol ezpz
[16:26:09] <robertmaxrees> .map() gets you the array of values, .get() converts to a normal js array, filter() removes all the NaNs from the map, .reduce() adds 'em all together.
[16:27:49] <mandude> Ahhh
[16:27:55] <mandude> I think it makes sense now
[16:28:00] <mandude> Show me your guitar stuff
[16:28:10] <mandude> video or it didn't happen!
[16:28:29] <taplar> small bug if you type zero in an input field
[16:29:49] <robertmaxrees> not seeing a bug...
[16:30:01] <robertmaxrees> mandude check out my username on instagram ;)
[16:30:03] <taplar> if you just put 0 in one of the fields, reduce on empty set error
[16:30:12] <taplar> the initial value to reduce fixes that
[16:30:31] <robertmaxrees> not seeing that happen...
[16:31:53] <taplar> https://imgur.com/DpSVjpc
[16:32:24] <robertmaxrees> fair.
[16:32:28] <robertmaxrees> easy enough fix.
[16:32:30] <mandude> Ahh
[16:32:33] <mandude> Kenny G style
[16:32:44] <mandude> Relax to the sounds of the smooth jazz
[16:32:46] <robertmaxrees> *SRV style
[16:32:50] <mandude> Rebel Radio is going off line!
