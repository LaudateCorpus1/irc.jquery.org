[00:00:30] <magixx32> wtf
[00:00:42] <magixx32> i tried firefox and it reports it correctly
[00:00:56] <magixx32> atleast in the firefox console
[00:03:29] <coldhead> i don't see that it has any width in jsbin
[00:03:51] <magixx32> for me even IE reports it as 256
[00:05:51] <magixx32> if i click edit in jsbin then Run with JS it outputs 256 in the console view
[00:06:02] <magixx32> when i click browse
[00:19:15] <trinadh> magixx32: console.log gets executed before image is loaded , so it shows 0

[00:23:59] <fabioportieri> i'm having trouble rebinding a named event handler, can you help? http://pastie.org/7756649
[00:25:59] <coldhead> fabioportieri: To remove specific delegated event handlers, provide a selector argument. The selector string must exactly match the one passed to .on() when the event handler was attached. To remove all delegated events from an element without removing non-delegated events, use the special value "**".
[00:26:03] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[00:26:21] <coldhead> i don't think you can unbind with a selector something you bound using $('some html')
[00:26:48] <fabioportieri> coldhead: the unbinding works, is the rebinding that is giving me problems
[00:26:48] <coldhead> fabioportieri: http://api.jquery.com/off/

[01:05:47] <DrPoole> g'day
[01:05:54] <DrPoole> http://pastebin.com/hVVtCNSF
[01:05:59] <DrPoole> stuck on this.  a global var issue
[01:06:17] <DrPoole> im running .ajax to get some data and then later in my code i may need to re-process that (existing) array
[01:06:23] <DrPoole> but i cant seem to get it into the global scope any way i try.
[01:07:02] <Cork> DrPoole: you get it in global scope, but you're missing the async nature
[01:07:44] <Cork> DrPoole: so most likely you haven't let the browser do a tick between the ajax call and your code
[01:07:53] <Cork> so the ajax callback haven't triggered
[01:08:24] <Cork> DrPoole: basically it's not a grate idea to use global variables from callbacks in other code
[01:08:35] <Cork> cause you never know if the data has actually arrived or not
[01:09:06] <DrPoole> i'd really like to avoid going to fetch it every time though.  the situation is ... im displaying the data but the user can click on a checkbox which will change the filtering
[01:09:14] <DrPoole> i'd rather not go crawling for the entire array again if i can help it.
[01:09:56] <Cork> DrPoole: sure, but your other code will have to have a mecanism that 1. prevents it from running synchronously, 2. waits for the first ajax callback to trigger
[01:10:12] <Cork> if your not using events or timers it just won't work
[01:10:37] <DrPoole> can you give me something to google to school me on this, please sir.
[01:10:52] <Cork> ?g javascript async race
[01:10:53] <b-ot> Cork: ajax - JavaScript asynchronous race condition - Stack Overflow â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1405197/javascript-asynchronous-race-condition
[01:10:55] <DrPoole> i thought async: false dealt with that
[01:11:08] <Cork> uhh.. ya
[01:11:20] <Cork> but you should NEVER use async false
[01:11:26] * DrPoole nods
[01:11:41] <Cork> if you ever find your self needing to do that; it means your page is design the wrong way
[01:11:49] <DrPoole> i see.
[01:11:54] <DrPoole> not sure the right way.  heh.
[01:12:06] <quietschie> sorry, can anyone help me?
[01:12:14] <quietschie> hi, is there a way to find the next element that matches a selector, no matter where in the tree structure it is?
[01:12:15] <Cork> syncronus ajax calls means the browser (including ui) hangs until the server response gets back (or the call times out)
[01:12:52] <DrPoole> ah, that is a bit balls
[01:12:57] <Cork> quietschie: you sould get a list of the element that matched
[01:13:17] <DrPoole> see selector wildcard, i guess
[01:13:21] <DrPoole> i dont quite understand your question
[01:13:37] <Cork> DrPoole: basically sync ajax is still around for legacy support
[01:13:40] <theresajayne_> what am i doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/QmasD/
[01:13:41] <Cork> but should never be used
[01:13:53] <DrPoole> Cork: dare to see what im doing and offer any insight?  not looking for hand holding ... just a direction :-)
[01:13:59] <theresajayne_> Cork we need it though
[01:14:11] <quietschie> Cork: and which in this list is the next to the element i'm searching from?
[01:14:15] <theresajayne_> we have to have the data at the next point
[01:14:15] <Cork> therealklanni:  $(".highlight").removeClass(''highlight')
[01:14:25] <Cork> *theresajayne_:
[01:14:38] <Cork> theresajayne_: that means you've designed the page wrong
[01:14:53] <Cork> there is no need for async as long as you write your code correctly
[01:15:14] <theresajayne_> not working http://jsfiddle.net/QmasD/1/
[01:15:19] <DrPoole> hmmm.  i guess if the user selects a filters which requires the correct array to be restructured i could work with the current contents of the div.  that sounds painful, though.
[01:15:23] <Cork> quietschie: $('selector') == gives you an array of matches
[01:15:26] <DrPoole> s/correct/current
[01:15:47] <develkar> noob?
[01:15:53] <Cork> theresajayne_: helps if you load jquery http://jsfiddle.net/QmasD/2/
[01:15:57] <theresajayne_> Cork, ok i need to call some ajax in a popup to get a response, there is no other way unless i do a submit (which we are trying not to)
[01:16:08] <theresajayne_> doh!
[01:16:20] <theresajayne_> thanks
[01:16:38] <Cork> theresajayne_: cancel the submit event
[01:16:55] <Cork> in the callback from the ajax callback do $('form')[0].submit()
[01:17:01] <Cork> there solved without sync
[01:18:13] <quietschie> Cork: yes, i know that, but i want to get the element out of that array that occurs next to the element is started. Something similar to sibling() but not restricted to the same dom-tree node.
[01:18:45] <DrPoole> hm.  but ... but ... in my code example ... my issue is not gaining access to the array, it's that it never seems to think it is already defined.  on first load it (correctly) fetches.  the next event fires and into the same function it doesn't know anything of shots_array.
[01:18:47] <Cork> quietschie: there is no way to do that
[01:19:23] <Cork> you can do var matches = $('selector'); matches.eq(matches.index(this) + 1)
[01:19:49] <Cork> but it's based on the css selector not really the dom tree
[01:20:37] <Cork> uh.. sorry
[01:20:45] <Cork> DrPoole: there is another problem with your code
[01:20:50] <Cork> the variable isn't global
[01:20:55] <Cork> its local to handle
[01:20:57] <quietschie> cork: ok, but is there no simple search function that just runs through the html and finds the next occurrence?
[01:21:08] <Cork> no
[01:21:14] <Cork> the code i gave you does that
[01:21:35] <DrPoole> quicksilver: use console.log() to see what you have
[01:21:45] <DrPoole> local to handle.  right, right.
[01:22:02] <Cork> do window.shots_array = instead
[01:22:08] <Cork> (without the var)
[01:22:37] <DrPoole> feels a tad filthy?
[01:23:04] <Cork> its much less filthy then doing implicit globals
[01:23:21] <Cork> some_variable_not_declared = 10;
[01:23:24] <quietschie> Cork: thanks, i don't quite understand what it does, but i'll give it a try
[01:23:42] <Cork> quietschie: it runs the selector and grabs all elements
[01:23:54] <Cork> then you find the index in that array for the current element (this)
[01:24:03] <Cork> and then you go one step up in the array + 1
[01:24:31] <quietschie> ok, but there is the problem
[01:24:38] <Cork> ?
[01:24:47] <quietschie> i'm not searching for the same thing
[01:25:01] <DrPoole> ahhhhh
[01:25:04] <DrPoole> bless your heart, Cork
[01:25:08] <Cork> quietschie: then you're kinda out of luck
[01:25:13] <DrPoole> that solved my issue.  but now you've made me feel guilty about the async
[01:25:16] <DrPoole> ;)
[01:25:22] <Cork> :)
[01:25:23] <quietschie> i'm on element a and searching for the next element b
[01:25:34] <Cork> DrPoole: good, that was kinda the point ^^
[01:25:39] <DrPoole> did you try console.log, quicksilver?
[01:25:46] <DrPoole> it's a wealth of information
[01:25:58] <Cork> quietschie: the problem is what is "next"
[01:26:05] <Cork> the next visible on the rendered page?
[01:26:08] <Cork> next sibling?
[01:26:14] <Cork> next sibling/child?
[01:26:23] <quietschie> next occurence in html
[01:26:43] <Cork> there is no south thing
[01:26:57] * DrPoole grumbles
[01:26:59] <Cork> you're not working with html blob
[01:27:05] <Cork> your working with a dom TREE
[01:27:16] <DrPoole> my desire to do this the right away is exposing how rapid im aging.
[01:27:18] <DrPoole> lose/lose
[01:27:23] <DrPoole> s/away/way
[01:27:33] <Cork> so you will have to walk the parent/child relation, or use css selectors
[01:27:37] <quietschie> do all elements in the domtree have a ongoing index or something?
[01:27:40] <DrPoole> still illiterate as fuck, tho.
[01:27:57] <Cork> only if you set one
[01:28:09] <Cork> quietschie: could you provide the context of what you're doing?
[01:28:21] <Cork> sounds like your attacking it from the wrong angle
[01:28:47] <seutje> all this violence :(
[01:28:47] <quietschie> puh..ok, i'll try
[01:29:24] * Cork gives seutje +10 resistance to violence
[01:30:34] <seutje> heh, thanks â™¥
[01:30:49] <DrPoole> much appreciated for the insight Cork.  cheers, mate.
[01:30:56] <Cork> DrPoole: good luck
[01:33:32] <quietschie> i use jQuery to add a button to a <td> that i cannot access from php (generated by another extension), when i click the button i want to do sth with another part of the table. This would not be that hard, but these tables occur more than once and so i have multiple event.targets that should act on different tables (allthough always the same table part).
[01:34:37] <quietschie> Cork
[01:35:19] <Cork> ok, so give the tables a class
[01:35:31] <Cork> and then select the set of tables based on that class
[01:35:40] <Cork> then do the modification on it
[01:36:22] <Cork> or if the table you want is always the one next after the table with the button you can use that
[01:36:33] <Cork> (more html structure would help)
[01:37:04] <quietschie> Cork: *thumbs up* why did i think so complicated?
[01:37:13] <Cork> :)
[01:38:19] <quietschie> argh, no won't work
[01:39:12] <quietschie> or at least not that easy, i'll provide code, Cork
[01:57:25] <quietschie> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/QnkmE/
[01:58:33] <Cork> quietschie: and it's from the restore defaults in the link table?
[01:59:16] <quietschie> yes
[01:59:19] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').next().find('table')
[01:59:42] <Cork> oh' it's ul's
[01:59:45] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').next().find('ul')
[02:00:03] <Cork> well you get the idea :)
[02:00:09] <quietschie> ok, thanks
[02:00:27] <quietschie> but isn'T this considered as 'ugly'?
[02:00:34] <Cork> not really
[02:00:41] <Cork> why would it?
[02:00:53] <sacho> what, dom traversal?
[02:01:13] <quietschie> never change the tree :)
[02:01:24] <Cork> quietschie: what might be ugly is the over use of tables in that layout
[02:01:29] <Cork> but that's another matter
[02:02:14] <quietschie> as said, i have to, because the initial table is not mine
[02:02:24] <Cork> ya, i remember
[02:02:32] <Cork> that's why i said it's another matter
[02:02:45] <quietschie> ok, thank you!
[02:02:48] <quicksilver> quietschie and I should start a campaign for people to only use IRC clients with intelligent completion.
[02:03:39] <Cork> quicksilver: then i would start a campain that no one in a channel should have the same first three characters as anyone else ;P
[02:04:57] <quicksilver> nah, smart completion has existed since before most of the people in this channel were born
[02:05:03] <quicksilver> it's not that hard to just use it.
[02:05:44] <Inspiral> I have a .live("mouseover event which triggers on dynamically loaded content, and a .bind to that for a mouseleave event. They both work perfectly for content that is already loaded, however, when new content is dynamically added to the page only the mouseover event triggers any idea?
[02:07:03] <Cork> Inspiral: 1. live is deprecated, use .delegate or .on 2. bind binds the event to the element the selector matched when the code ran so new elements won't have any event listeners; use delegated event listeners for those
[02:07:17] <Inspiral> i am using live because my jquery version is 1.3.2
[02:07:33] <Inspiral> is delegated available for that?
[02:07:44] <Cork> hmm no
[02:07:49] <Cork> it came in 1.4
[02:07:57] <Inspiral> any other suggestions?
[02:08:10] <Cork> upgrade? :D
[02:08:12] <Inspiral> anything would help been at this for hours and hours
[02:08:17] <Inspiral> haha that would break everything else :D
[02:08:38] <Cork> the eventlistener has to be bound on an existing element
[02:08:52] <Cork> live does that too, but in an uggly way
[02:09:11] <Inspiral> the impression i get is that i have to use live because of the dynamic content
[02:09:11] <Cork> you can write your own delegate though
[02:09:22] <Inspiral> can i now...
[02:12:19] <Cork> Inspiral: $('parent').bind('event', function(event) { if(!$(this).find('selector').has(event.target)) { return; } /* the selector matches */ })
[02:13:20] <Cork> bah i always mix them up...
[02:14:35] <Cork> Inspiral: $('parent').bind('event', function(event) { if($(this).find('selector').index(event.target) == -1 ) { return; } /* the selector matches */ })
[02:14:42] <Cork> there that should even work in 1.3 :)
[02:18:35] <fabioportieri> this regex works on rubular site but fails in my js for the char "\" ? [|<>:\\\*\?\"\/]
[02:18:51] <Inspiral> cork: does this look right? .bind("mouseleave", function(event){if ($(this).find('.catalog-grid-wrapper').index(event.target) == -1) { return; }
[02:19:13] <chrisbuchholz> Hey guys
[02:19:20] <Cork> Inspiral: it should
[02:19:26] <Inspiral> doesnt seem to work :)
[02:19:26] <chrisbuchholz> what is the best, fastest way to move all content from one div to another?
[02:19:27] <Cork> Inspiral: though i'm not sure if leave bubbles
[02:19:41] <Cork> Inspiral: you might have to use mouseout
[02:20:06] <Inspiral> that doesnt appear to be an option, i have clickable stuff inside the div
[02:20:11] <Cork> chrisbuchholz: $(this).find('*').appendTo('#other')
[02:20:18] <Inspiral> which promptly causes the mouseout to trigger
[02:20:41] <chrisbuchholz> Cork: thanks
[02:20:45] <Cork> ya, but like i said mouseleave/mouseenter doens't bubble so you can't delegate it
[02:21:00] <Cork> `api mouseenter
[02:21:01] <b-ot> Cork: .mouseenter(): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[02:21:49] <Inspiral> maybe i will just have to settle for a click event... :)
[02:22:18] <Cork> or might be worth looking into actually migrating the page to a remotely modern version of jquery
[02:22:24] <Cork> 1.3 is really old now days
[02:22:57] <Inspiral> yeh i guess so, I am not really able to at the moment but i guess in the future it would be best
[02:23:22] <Cork> ya, i know i have a site that got stuck on 1.4
[02:23:48] <Cork> they change how event bubbles too much for it to go beyond that one
[02:25:30] <Inspiral> heh, well thank you for taking the time out to help me :)
[02:25:46] <Cork> np
[02:25:48] <Inspiral> i will crack on with it for a little while longer
[02:25:58] <Inspiral> and then give up until tomorrow
[02:25:59] <Inspiral> :)
[02:26:29] <Cork> jquery below 1.4 is not fun, it still lacked a bit too many of the event handing features
[02:26:47] <Cork> and actually 1.4 misses a few important parts too
[02:27:07] <Inspiral> it is a shame things are not backward compatible
[02:27:10] <Cork> but not close to as important ones as 1.3
[02:27:25] <Cork> Inspiral: normally it is actually
[02:27:57] <Cork> the site before moved from jquery 1.1 to 1.3 without a problem before getting sacked
[02:28:09] <Cork> (several separate updates)
[02:28:36] <Cork> and 1.5 to 1.9 is normally not a problem
[02:28:55] <Inspiral> thats just given me a thought,
[02:29:04] <Inspiral> i wonder if i can upgrade to a slightly higher version
[02:29:08] <Inspiral> rather than latest
[02:29:28] <Cork> ya, skiping several versions at a time is often harder
[02:35:36] <fabioportieri> why the regex fails at char "\" ? http://jsfiddle.net/pC5Me/
[02:36:10] <Cork> cause you already have it in a string
[02:36:21] <fabioportieri> ?
[02:36:47] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pC5Me/1/
[02:37:14] <Cork> js> '\"'
[02:37:17] <b-ot> Cork: No output.

[02:37:32] <Cork> js> print('\\"')
[02:37:34] <b-ot> Cork: \"
[02:37:53] <fabioportieri> uhmm
[02:37:57] <Cork> if you give it to regex you need to escape the escape character
[02:38:16] <Cork> *if you give it as a string to regex
[02:38:23] <fabioportieri> i escaped it didn't i?
[02:38:35] <fabioportieri> [|<>:\\*?\"\/]
[02:38:36] <Cork> for the string ya, but not for regex
[02:38:37] <LEDfan> Hi, I want to change the value of a input field which is added by jQuery. I can't use .on, I must be triggered when a specific function is called.

[02:56:38] <jop008> a bit  html the cache stuf
[02:56:59] <Cork> jop008: i meant html is html, webapp is web app it's separate standards
[02:57:18] <Cork> and html5 is nothing but hot air
[02:57:24] <jop008> a webapp uses html also
[02:57:34] <Cork> yes, exactly
[02:57:48] <Cork> webapp builds uses the html standards not part of it
[02:57:52] <Cork> -builds
[02:58:18] <Cork> jop008: simplest is prob to ask in a channel specific for where you try to install the webapp
[02:58:18] <jop008> <table for example
[02:58:32] <Cork> as the manifests differ a little bit
[02:58:41] <jop008> Yes but which channel
[02:59:14] <Guest88269> hi
[02:59:32] <Cork> jop008: what browser are you trying to install it in?
[03:00:10] <jop008> target device is w8 using a tablet
[03:00:27] <jop008> so IE10
[03:00:36] <Cork> ouch
[03:00:37] <jop008> testing env chrome
[03:00:49] <Cork> i don't think there is much support channels for ie
[03:01:10] <jop008> but chrome can be run also on the tablet
[03:01:57] <jop008> At the final point the app must also include picture capabilities (camera support)
[03:02:22] <Cork> jop008: and from what i understand it as chrome doesn't have a support channel either
[03:02:35] <Cork> (they use a forum)
[03:02:41] <Cork> but i might be wrong there
[03:02:48] <jop008> I can start there on manifest file
[03:03:59] <jop008> I was hoping for a forum
[03:04:10] <jop008> on HTML5 stuf
[03:04:25] <Cork> jop008: like i said html5 is a buzz word
[03:05:16] <Cork> so take html + js + jquery + css{2.1, 3, 4} + ajax + other animation features + speed + design patterns
[03:05:22] <jop008> appcache stuf where is that addressed?
[03:05:25] <Cork> and you have aprox what is normally meant by html5
[03:05:31] <Cork> so it dosen't mean anything really
[03:05:53] <Cork> sounds like a specific browser extension
[03:06:28] <Cork> or it might be part of the openwebapp standard
[03:06:45] <Cork> (have to admit i haven't read through the standard yet, just tested it)
[03:10:14] <darkmutt> hi jquery channel
[03:13:49] <moijk> i want to hide and show (slide out/in) an j-ui accordion. but whatever i try the j-ui accordion stops working and/or slides erraticly.
[03:16:22] <darkmutt> moijk can i see the fiddle please?
[03:22:40] <napster> jqmobile noob here. I have a radio button group and a submit button below that. based on the selection of the radio groups I need to navigate to another page (in my single page template model). The navigated page should be based on the selection of the radio buttons. How can I do this?
[03:27:32] <darkmutt> that's html more then jquery i think napster
[03:28:29] <napster> oh I see. I'm infact a mobile developer. more a C++/Java guy. Mind telling me how to do that?
[03:28:34] <darkmutt> someone mind taking a peek here?? http://jsbin.com/usiqox/1/edit
[03:29:25] <darkmutt> not really sure napster at first thought though i did something very similar once make the radio buttons pass variables to the link clicked i guess?
[03:30:06] <timini> I there any way to search up the dome tree? something like .findParent()
[03:30:19] <napster> ok let me digg. thanks anyway darkmutt
[03:30:43] <darkmutt> timini, http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/ there you go
[03:31:38] <darkmutt> i don't get why mi jsbin isn't working correctly (what images are used doesn't actually matter at all just how they move does)
[04:05:03] <Lucaszz> Hi
[04:05:53] <Lucaszz> Could you take look on some script ? I cant detect how is there ui dialog closing ...
[04:08:31] <Cork> Lucaszz: you mean how it's triggered?
[04:08:52] <Cork> or detecting that the user is closing it?
[04:11:58] <Rayon> Anyone can tell me how i can easly select a spesific list item depending on a click? http://jsfiddle.net/CzfLz/
[04:14:43] <xec> ?index @ Rayon
[04:14:58] <xec> sigh
[04:15:14] <Cork> Rayon: http://jsfiddle.net/CzfLz/1/
[04:16:38] <Rayon> @Corck, thats perfect its just adding it up it should also delete de one that is active but i think i can get that to work
[04:16:40] <xec> Rayon: like Cork just demonstrated, you can use http://api.jquery.com/index/ to find the position of the link clicked
[04:16:59] <Rayon> (i am new to jquery so i am trying to figure it all out) but this really helped me! :)
[04:18:19] <Rayon> xec: i didnt know about that function
[04:18:25] <Rayon> thanks :)
[04:32:19] <RSDRSDRSD> I am looking for a good script to access a webcam via jquery and which also lets me stream to a wowza server

[04:38:33] <rahulprasad> Hello, I want to implement navigation on "left" and "right" keypress, but It affects textfield too.
[04:38:51] <rahulprasad> If someone is writing a comment, and press "left" or "right" key
[04:39:02] <rahulprasad> The event gets fired
[04:39:08] <rahulprasad> How do I prevent this ?
[04:39:47] <rahulprasad> I want to navigate on "left" and "right" key press only when user is not editing a text field or text area
[04:39:52] <rahulprasad> How do I do this ?
[04:40:05] <rahulprasad> Thank in advance
[04:42:31] <Qdest> !$(tContainer).is(':animated') == $(tContainer).not(":animated") ?
[04:43:20] <Qdest> Is it the same thing? And could I do it even easier, such as $(tContainer:not(:animated)) ?
[04:47:45] <darkmutt> i wouldn't say it will work the same but i'm not sure
[04:49:48] <Qdest> Also, I have var item = $(".something"); and var container = $("#somethingelse"); how can I do $(container + item); to select $("#somethingelse .something"); ?
[04:50:49] <Qdest> right now I have to do $(container).find(item);
[04:51:08] <Qdest> but that would search the container scope for item which could take some time if the scope is big enough etc
[04:51:27] <Qdest> Any suggestions?
[04:59:36] <Qdest> Okay so .add
[05:02:27] <v1n> hi

[05:04:56] <v1n> this is my function client-side:
[05:04:58] <v1n> http://pastebin.com/MKgTN9Wk

[05:06:39] <v1n> the array is supposed to be two-dimensional, but with values ;)
[05:07:40] <v1n> any ideas what i'm doing wrong?
[05:12:31] <darkmutt> I've got a slight problem I've got a mouseenter mouseleave animation however i would like for jquery not to remember the animation query and go straight from the existing to the hovered one
[05:12:32] <darkmutt> any ideas?

[05:16:08] <darkmutt> hi kheeper
[05:16:58] <kheeper> I need a help with something can I upload it to pastebin?
[05:17:24] <darkmutt> well we can't help you kheeper unless we see the code
[05:17:42] <darkmutt> question how would i make an animation run only if mouse is hovered for like 1 or so seconds??
[05:17:50] <kheeper> ok :) give me a second
[05:22:40] <v1n> no idea about my problem? :(
[05:23:53] <kheeper> ok here is my problem http://pastebin.com/TpACUHpk. what am I doing wrong?
[05:27:54] <kheeper> the errorMessage div is hidden by CSS (display: none) but I don't know why the PopUpMessage function can't fadeIn ...

[05:40:53] <anew> anyone know any good dedicated server providors in america ?
[05:48:57] <RNT> hi, i'm facing a problem on IE with $(window).load(function(), has someone a similar experience ?
[05:50:21] <RNT> i mean, how $(window).load(function() deals with the order of script execution
[06:01:07] <RNT> nobody knows a little bit more about $(window).load function?
[06:01:08] <RNT> :(
[06:02:39] <seutje> RNT: what's the problem exactly?
[06:03:23] <RNT> a event fires up in different order in IE than in others browsers
[06:03:39] <seutje> that is odd
[06:04:13] <RNT> open this page in IE and in another browser to see what i mean:
[06:04:14] <RNT> http://rntplayer.com/test3.php
[06:05:24] <seutje> sry, not gonna boot up a VM for that
[06:05:35] <RNT> ok
[06:05:52] <RNT> why you need a vm?
[06:05:53] <RNT> :-o
[06:06:00] <seutje> I'm not sure what could be causing the problem, but would moving away from window load be a possible solution?
[06:06:10] <seutje> IE doesn't run on this
[06:06:17] <seutje> so I gotta boot a windoze in a vm
[06:06:28] <RNT> i see
[06:06:39] <kai> hi folks
[06:07:05] <seutje> RNT: are you waiting for images to be loaded? is that why you're using window load?
[06:07:53] <branant> Could someone help me out in programatically setting the value of a select box? http://jsfiddle.net/sah9e/2/
[06:07:57] <seutje> cause if that's the case, u might be better off using imagesLoaded()
[06:08:10] <RNT> seutje, if is IE, IE won't execute the part of code before "alert()", but other browser will do
[06:08:25] <RNT> and i need to put my codes in a certai n order, of course
[06:08:30] <seutje> RNT: well, the presence of that alert could already fuck shit up
[06:08:43] <kai> I'm trying to write some functions for input file validation for a web app I've got, and I'm wondering how to best write unit tests for it. is there something I can easily run from the command line?
[06:09:00] <seutje> RNT: and if the problem is specific to window load, using imagesloaded could solve your problem
[06:09:19] <seutje> afaik, event handlers are executed in the order they were attached
[06:09:28] <seutje> but window load has always been a bit special iirc
[06:09:48] <RNT> so, what i havv to do for checking if the things have been executed in the correct order?
[06:10:16] <RNT> :-?
[06:10:44] <RNT> the true, is, i don't really know what is the problem
[06:10:45] <RNT> :(
[06:11:00] <RNT> but for sure is a problem somewhere with IE
[06:11:00] <mgco3> -
[06:11:45] <branant> seutje: having some trouble selecting a value of a h2 which is a sibling of my a click. http://jsfiddle.net/sah9e/2/
[06:14:30] <seutje> branant: it's not a sibling http://jsfiddle.net/sah9e/3/
[06:14:41] <seutje> it's just also a descendant of .views-row
[06:14:56] <fabioportieri> my coworkers are so noisy i'm gonna kill them all
[06:16:06] <branant> seutje: thanks for having a look but it doesn't seem to be working. select option is not being set
[06:16:30] <seutje> odd
[06:16:54] <branant> Err wait. It magically started working after 4-5 clicks!
[06:17:32] <branant> Let me just test again
[06:17:40] <branant> So its called a descendant
[06:17:41] <Wolf_22> When inside a FOR loop, how do you reference the given element you're currently iterating over? I keep thinking you can do this like you can with arrays where you use something like "[i]" next to the element but I can't remember how it's done.
[06:17:49] <seutje> it works for everything except presidential for some reason
[06:18:25] <branant> seutje: mmmm
[06:18:33] <seutje> wtf
[06:18:37] <seutje> did u break the markup
[06:18:52] <seutje> the presidential one isn't in a views-row
[06:19:04] <seutje> it isn't even in the view-content
[06:19:14] <branant> hah, must have cocked up the paste
[06:19:51] <branant> seutje: working on jsfiddle but not on my site
[06:20:17] <branant> my bad
[06:21:06] <branant> seutje: thanks its perfect
[06:21:54] <darkmutt> which is better if it matters at all $('foo').on({click:function(){code}})
[06:22:07] <seutje> branant: I fixeth http://jsfiddle.net/sah9e/4/
[06:22:11] <darkmutt> or $('foo').on("click",function(){code})
[06:22:39] <seutje> the first is a bit silly when only binding a single handler to a single event
[06:22:49] <RNT> seutje, may i send you a pm to explain better what's happening?
[06:23:00] <seutje> no plz
[06:23:07] <RNT> :))
[06:23:08] <RNT> ok
[06:23:18] <darkmutt> I have 2handlers and 2 events so im asking XD
[06:23:23] <seutje> sry, should get back to work
[06:23:41] <seutje> darkmutt: then I'd use the former, one less .on() call that way
[06:25:16] <pfFredd> Can I have this function "$(document).on("pageinit", function() {"    and this    "$(document).on("#page-countadmin", "pageinit", function() {"    on the same page?
[06:28:16] <RNT> i think you can, pfFredd
[06:29:27] <pfFredd> RNT, asking cause the second one (with the #page specified) doesn't fire for some reason :/
[06:30:34] <RNT> :-?
[06:32:55] <RNT> pfFredd, but you can not use only one function with all parameters and after that do some "if" iside it?
[06:33:21] <pfFredd> RNT, swapped the parameters "#page-countadmin" and "pageinit" and it worked ;)
[06:33:35] <RNT> good :)
[06:34:14] <RNT> hi BillCriswell :)
[06:34:23] <RNT> ;;)
[06:35:05] <BillCriswell> Howdy.
[06:35:19] <branant> Is there a way to animate a background colour without using jquery ui colour plugin?
[06:35:30] <RNT> IE problem... may you help me?
[06:36:30] <RNT> css?
[06:36:45] <branant> need JS to do it
[06:36:47] <BillCriswell> branant: Depends on the support you need browser wise.
[06:36:58] <branant> the more the merrier
[06:37:12] <RNT> js + css should work
[06:37:24] <BillCriswell> RNT: I have a call in a bit, you can ask a question and I'll try haha.
[06:37:31] <RNT> :))
[06:38:19] <RNT> my page behaves different in IE than in other browser
[06:38:21] <darkmutt> hi BillCriswell you helped me out lots with that offset last time wanna peek at the result?XD
[06:38:39] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: Sure thing!
[06:38:57] <BillCriswell> branant: http://jsbin.com/ezuzem/1/edit if you don't need it for old IE.
[06:39:37] <darkmutt> http://jsbin.com/izokon/1/edit BillCriswell much less glitchy now one last thing i HAVE to fix somehow is making sure the browser doesn't remember where mouse moved but where it's now
[06:40:09] <branant> BillCriswell: need it in jquery though not using css
[06:41:06] <BillCriswell> branant: gnarf's plugin could work for you: http://gnarf.net/2011/06/01/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/
[06:41:19] <darkmutt> BillCriswell, won't $('selector').on("mouseover", function(){$(this).animate(background-color:"#f00")})
[06:41:25] <darkmutt> won't this work for you branant ??
[06:41:32] <branant> BillCriswell: can only use core
[06:41:50] <BillCriswell> branant: Why?
[06:41:57] <branant> such is life
[06:42:10] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: Seems fun... kind of a pain in the ass but seems like what you were shooting for haha
[06:42:41] <darkmutt> almost exactly what i was shooting for i just need to find that last thing on making sure that the browser doesn't 'remember'
[06:42:57] <darkmutt> i'd try with hoverintent but for some reason it won't click :/
[06:49:25] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: jQuery won't animate colors without jQuery UI.
[06:50:09] <darkmutt> http://jsbin.com/ogejew/1/edit almost perfectly here ohh dangit
[06:51:25] <OneBraveHog> I see jquerymobile is locked as a chan -  is jquerymobile mature now ?
[06:51:32] <OneBraveHog> I looked last fall- 2012 - it was in dev
[06:51:32] <branant> Man, really can't animate colours without a pluginâ€¦ crazy.
[06:51:57] <OneBraveHog> branant - and the paradox there is - what are plugins made with ?   surely not more plugins
[06:52:19] <branant> even css can animate colour these days.
[06:52:24] <nFFF> You can't animate colours/
[06:52:28] <nFFF> What do you mean?
[06:52:37] <BillCriswell> He only wants to use core.
[06:52:43] <BillCriswell> Which makes no sense, but whatever.
[06:52:49] <OneBraveHog> I think they mean change colors by some time interval cyclicly
[06:53:19] <nFFF> You can achieve that though
[06:53:24] <branant> I mean just go from background-color: yellow to white in 2s
[06:53:28] <nFFF> Using multiple divs, and fade the divs in
[06:53:43] <OneBraveHog> NEAT to see creative tactics
[06:53:53] <nFFF> branant you can do that
[06:53:56] <nFFF> you need two divs
[06:54:00] <OneBraveHog> nFFF- whereEVER you work ? you are under paid !
[06:54:24] <branant> nFFF: I can't change the HTML output
[06:54:27] <darkmutt> three, 1 for text 2 for bg colors
[06:54:34] <darkmutt> dang man XD
[06:54:49] <BillCriswell> Please to be impossible.
[06:54:52] <BillCriswell> Pleased*
[06:54:55] <branant> :)
[06:55:09] <darkmutt> can't you just force a div colored into the html output with jquery though?
[06:55:35] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: Not sure any approach will be good enough at this point.
[06:56:12] <darkmutt> BillCriswell, any ideas on how to make my animation skip all the divs that the mouse only moved over and just go from the last'current' to the new 'now' one??
[06:56:22] <darkmutt> cause now it animates each entrance and exit :/;
[06:57:01] <pachet> i havent been following the conversation, but sounds like you might want to look at .stop
[06:57:04] <pachet> ?.stop()
[06:57:05] <branant> BillCriswell: never give up, mate ;)
[06:57:23] <pachet> dang bot-t
[06:57:56] <darkmutt> i don't want to stop nor pause the animation just make it work by starting the animation only say 1second after the mousehovered
[06:58:09] <darkmutt> unless i can force the animation to drop/stop on mouseleave/mouseout
[06:59:15] <nFFF> can't you use hoverIntent or write your own?
[07:00:07] <darkmutt> I'm already trying to and now i'm working with what's like 6th version of the same script xD
[07:02:12] <arechsteiner> hi! does anyone know what slider this is: http://cleancanvas.herokuapp.com/?
[07:02:32] <arechsteiner> or which jQuery plugin would enable me to do a similar one?
[07:03:46] <darkmutt> im pretty sure each slide is customized but i didn't check ;p
[07:04:27] <arechsteiner> darkmutt: do you mean the slider is a custom dev?
[07:04:49] <shoky> arechsteiner: looks like a custom slider http://cleancanvas.herokuapp.com/js/index-slider.js
[07:04:53] <darkmutt> think so but im not sure
[07:05:24] <arechsteiner> shoky: Yeah I looked at that and thought the same thing, but maybe he just removed the header?
[07:05:33] <arechsteiner> do people develop custom sliders? :)
[07:05:48] <shoky> arechsteiner: of course
[07:05:58] <darkmutt> course they do
[07:06:14] <arechsteiner> isn't that a hell of a lot of work? with all the free slides available i mean?
[07:06:18] <darkmutt> for example i saw a nice gallery that kinda slides but i didn't wanna pay for it to someone so i made my own without checking their code
[07:06:37] <yannickoo> hey guys, this here is the right place for asking questions about jquery mobile right?
[07:06:43] <darkmutt> arechsteiner, there's billions of website templates available for free and ppl still commision their own don't they?
[07:07:09] <arechsteiner> fair enough
[07:07:42] <gnarf> branant: jQuery Color is a plugin maintained by the jQuery team
[07:08:10] <gnarf> It would be a part of core if it wasn't pretty damn big, and most people didn't need to animate color
[07:11:34] <nFFF> darkmutt, is this what you wanted: http://jsbin.com/ogejew/4/edit
[07:12:25] <darkmutt> that is awesome nFFF thank you!:D
[07:13:10] <nFFF> thumbnail.hoverIntent(showAnim, 1000); // 1000 is obviously the delay in milliseconds, so you adjusting this changes the hover delay
[07:16:04] <SeanJM> Hi guys, I have two different scripts binding to the 'body' element--and it's giving me a hard time. Is there a way for me to share those bindings without merging those scripts? One script is jQueryUI and the other is my own.
[07:29:21] <Marghitos> i can't make the .on("load".. ) working. here is my code http://pastebin.com/brRjesJc
[07:31:40] <fabioportieri> maybe you want document.ready?
[07:32:18] <caddoo> is it possible with jqueryui already loaded to load in extra elements of it?
[07:32:21] <caddoo> like slider and buttons
[07:33:04] <Marghitos> no, i wanted load. I need to wait for an image to be loaded
[07:33:39] <fabioportieri> Marghitos: can't do that, use .load()
[07:33:52] <Marghitos> wasn't deprecated?
[07:34:08] <fabioportieri> uhm right
[07:34:39] <fabioportieri> actually you should be able to do that, my mistake
[07:35:21] <fabioportieri> but the docs says Caveats of the load event when used with images
[07:35:38] <fabioportieri> "Can cease to fire for images that already live in the browser's cache"
[07:35:45] <zuloyd> hi
[07:35:56] <fabioportieri> so maybe that's it
[07:36:43] <fabioportieri> that api appears to be full of issue
[07:36:44] <zuloyd> when making a     $("#something").click(function() {  ... } );     is it possible to use variables from the outside inside that function with the values they had when the function was declared?
[07:37:48] <zuloyd> something like this: http://pastebin.com/DG2nxPr9
[07:37:58] <zuloyd> only that in my version it doesn't work for obvious reasons
[07:38:24] <fabioportieri> you need closures if you have listeners inside a loop
[07:38:52] <Marghitos> ok..it's not so good-working. I'll remove it
[07:39:19] <Tumulte> for pure readingness reasons, I'd need several $(function(){
[07:39:24] <Tumulte> is it bad or not ?
[07:39:35] <fabioportieri> zuloyd: http://www.foliotek.com/devblog/keep-variable-state-between-event-binding-and-execution/
[07:39:40] <Tumulte> (performance-wise... best practise-wise
[07:39:51] <fabioportieri> Tumulte: it's not bad
[07:40:26] <zuloyd> thnaks fabioportieri
[07:40:29] <zuloyd> thanks*
[07:40:39] <fabioportieri> you're welcome
[07:41:04] <Tumulte> fabioportieri: ok cool thanks
[07:41:12] <Tumulte> I guess it's fairly common
[07:43:23] <Tumulte> just tracking what might slow down the code
[07:44:14] <fabioportieri> i was asking myself the same thing time ago
[07:44:35] <Layke> Hey, I'm trying to turn some jquery module to load it AMD format. I don't really know jQueyr that well, but I see that inside, it uses a global jQuery variable. I'm just curious as this looks wrong... is there a reason why some use jQuery and some use $ ?
[07:44:56] <fabioportieri> Layke: $ is just a shortcut
[07:45:18] <pachet> Layke: less likely that someone will collide with 'jQuery' than $
[07:47:45] <Layke> I see thanks. I'm sure it's to do with the way that I'm loading jquery, but I'm finding that $ exists (correctly as the jQuery object), but the variable jQuery remains undefined.
[07:48:08] <Layke> I just went over this third party module, and changed jQuery to $, and it's working for me.
[07:49:10] <Layke> I am doing some funky things though, in order to AMD'ify my code. Here's a minimal example.
[07:49:10] <Layke> http://pastie.org/7758202
[07:49:26] <untaken> how do I change the color of the jqueryui dialog title bar with css? I keep getting orange no matter what I try
[07:50:28] <Layke> untaken, Inspect the element, and check to make sure that your selector is actually being applied. Either your rule isn't correct, you are loading the selector in the wrong order, of the default has a higher precedence.
[07:50:50] <untaken> ok Layke thanks
[07:51:08] <Layke> Inspecting the element and looking in the dev tools usually helps sort that things out right away
[07:52:05] <jeturcotte> so, I have a jQuery.post(url, data, function(response){ }, 'json'); callâ€¦ and I am getting a response from my service â€¦ but the contents of the function never occurâ€¦ any idea what i'm doing wrong?
[07:52:46] <untaken> Layke: is it easy to change the precendence?
[07:53:00] <untaken> precedence
[07:53:17] <Layke> If all things are the same (as in you use identical selectors to the current rules), then you just need to load them afterwards.
[07:53:28] <BillCriswell> jeturcotte: Are you getting a strange resonse header?
[07:53:43] <Layke> Otherwise, you need your selector to be more specific.. so add another .class, or something to make the rule more verbose. (You also have !important) but that's hacky.
[07:53:54] <clov3r> untaken: the css styles are applied in order that they are linked (external stylesheets) and then embedded and inline rules are applied
[07:54:06] <jeturcotte> not that i'm aware of, but headers aren't something I thought to check, so let me do so
[07:54:13] <untaken> ahh ok
[07:54:16] <clov3r> so make sure your custom.css is linked AFTER the ui css
[07:54:39] <clov3r> and make sure to be at least as specific as the UI rule in your selector
[07:54:54] <untaken> clov3r: see, I am adding inline rules, so you would of thought they took over precendce
[07:54:58] <BillCriswell> jeturcotte: I've seen weird cases where things will return what you want with a 404 header which will lead jQuery to think ( and rightfully so ) that the request failed.
[07:55:04] <clov3r> yeah you would
[07:55:13] <clov3r> but sometimes there'll be an !important tag
[07:55:21] <jeturcotte> aye aye; its a good avenue to investigate
[07:55:37] <clov3r> which overrides
[07:55:42] <untaken> ok
[07:55:44] <untaken> thanks
[07:55:46] <jeturcotte> is it possible it a content-type error could confuse jQuery in this?
[07:56:22] <clov3r> like layke says... inspect the element (ctrl-shift i, firefox on windows/linux, cmd alt i, firefox/chrome on mac)
[07:56:39] <BillCriswell> jeturcotte: It could. Is the content-type application/json?
[07:56:51] <jeturcotte> i'm in the process of looking but I could guess no
[07:57:03] <jeturcotte> is {'success': 0} malformed, you think?
[07:57:26] <jeturcotte> (in the above example I might be better off refactoring the service to send a CODE rather than json)
[07:57:30] <BillCriswell> jeturcotte: It's not legal JSON.
[07:57:51] <jeturcotte> hell, in both cases (success or fail) i could just return a code
[07:58:00] <BillCriswell> jeturcotte: Try changing 'json' to 'html' and see if it comes through.
[07:58:01] <jeturcotte> 200 vs. something else
[07:58:18] <jeturcotte> well it comes through, jquery simple isn't acting on it
[07:59:26] <jeturcotte> if I just sent codes back, would something like $.post().success(â€¦).fail(â€¦); be appropriate?
[07:59:45] <BillCriswell> That should be fine.
[08:00:03] <jeturcotte> apologies, i'm refactoring ANCIENT code, and it's been a while since I've had to deal with jquery
[08:00:13] <jeturcotte> thanks for the assistance, btw
[08:00:15] <jeturcotte> (brb)
[08:00:32] <BillCriswell> ok
[08:00:37] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:08:42] <workmeh> why does jquery mobile say it uses ajax to load contents of each 'page' in an html document? There's no server involved
[08:09:37] <workmeh> wouldn't it just be using javascript to traverse the dom, not ajax?
[08:12:13] <jo_> 'morning #jq.
[08:20:18] <jop008> if i have this <a href="#" data-icon="bars">Menu</a>
[08:20:29] <jop008> and I want my own icon how dot his?
[08:26:38] <clov3r> jop008 http://www.interactivebynature.net/2011.04.04.jquery-mobile-custom-icons
[08:26:50] <clov3r> just googled...
[08:27:23] <jop008> I googled also
[08:28:20] <cwatson> Anyone know of a good query image and quiz slideshow plugin?
[08:29:41] <jo_> Hmm.  I have a draggable div with $.data set for it.  When I drop it somewhere, I'm getting a reference to the cloned helper, it seems.  Any idea how to get the parent (really, the sibling) from the clone?
[08:36:29] <NoiseEee> jo_ examine the element in your debugger/console.
[08:56:24] <brainwarped> Hi! my server sends an httpresponse, and I want .ajax to capture it... how do you do that?
[08:58:22] <brainwarped> I can understand how to do it if the response was initiated via ajax via success...
[08:58:25] <workmeh> brainwarped: the .ajax docs say how
[08:58:54] <workmeh> brainwarped: well, that's how ajax works
[08:59:09] <workmeh> brainwarped: are you saying you want to long poll?
[08:59:20] <workmeh> or reverse ajax
[09:00:26] <brainwarped> workmeh: I'm not sure... I'm using django, and I have a view that returns the httpresponse, and I want to captpure the reponse and make an ajax call to a URL using it.
[09:02:01] <workmeh> brainwarped: yeah that's just a normal ajax call to your django endpoint then. So the ajax url should be the url to that controller action
[09:02:06] <brainwarped> workmeh: Oh, I see. I guess I don't understand how websites work:( so its not easy to capture an httpreponse unless javascript makes a call and expects a return?
[09:02:35] <stepitime> is it possible to add an attribute without a value using jquery?
[09:02:50] <stepitime> I've got an audio element:  <audio>...</audio>
[09:03:05] <stepitime> and I want to change it to <audio controls>...</audio>
[09:03:14] <workmeh> brainwarped: javascript is client side so think of it like you'd think of accessing any web server data. The client makes a get request to the url
[09:03:33] <brainwarped> workmeh: but the ajax call needs to be initiated when the client receives the httpresponse...
[09:03:41] <stepitime> I tried this:   .attr('controls',)
[09:03:58] <workmeh> stepitime: maybe .attr('controls','') ?
[09:03:59] <brainwarped> workmeh: I think your correct, its either a long poll or reverse ajax
[09:04:11] <stepitime> but no luck.  This adds the attribute:   .attr('controls','1') but that's nonsensical
[09:04:32] <workmeh> brainwarped: well even with long pollilng you have to start with the client side opening an ajax call to listen, iirc
[09:05:00] <stepitime> workmeh:   .attr('controls','')    yields     <audio controls='controls'>...</audio>
[09:05:10] <vsgill> anyone know a good jquery one page scroll plugin that has an anchor where you are close to one section and automatically moves you there?
[09:05:12] <brainwarped> workmeh: yea, thats not exactly what I want to do:( back to the drawing board... idea number 6, day 2.
[09:05:15] <workmeh> stepitime: " if, for example, the attribute has no value or is set to empty string value or even "false". This is true of all boolean attributes."
[09:05:42] <workmeh> it sets it to true, because a boolean control can't be empty
[09:05:53] <workmeh> brainwarped: you're better off just not having an attribute on it if you don't need it
[09:06:26] <stepitime> everybody:  nevermind... looks like   controls="true" is valid for html5   ...   right?? :-)
[09:06:45] <stepitime> workmeh: thanks!   reference:  http://html5tutorial.info/html5-audio.php
[09:06:46] <workmeh> stepitime: i see you just want <audio controls>
[09:07:38] <brainwarped> workmeh: I've been oscillating between doing this server side or client side. now I see, client side not work easily. server-side, I believe I can setup a signal (idea number 7).
[09:07:42] <stepitime> :-)  yep. But     controls='controls'   (or ='1'  or ='true') are all good. Thanks!
[09:08:12] <workmeh> stepitime: maybe you can use .prop instead
[09:09:18] <stepitime> workmeh: nope, didn't work... But I think I'm ok to just do    controls='true'. So I'm fine. Thanks for your help!
[09:09:24] <vsgill> anyone?
[09:09:30] <stepitime> html5's audio accepts them all
[09:09:33] <workmeh> stepitime: seems like there should be a way to do it though. Now you got me curious :D
[09:10:10] <jo_> @NoiseEee I'm looking at it in the console.  I when I pull the parent I get the containing div.  When I pull the siblings I get the 1.2k siblings.
[09:11:13] <jo_> Hmm.  Or is i only assigned the sortable-helper class...
[09:11:17] <jo_> Might not be a clone after all.
[09:11:31] <stepitime> workmeh:  Hey!   .prop('controls',true)   does what I want:  <audio controls>
[09:11:31] <jo_> But that doesn't explain why it's missing all the $.data values.
[09:11:37] <stepitime> workmeh: thanks a bunch!!
[09:11:56] <workmeh> cool
[09:11:57] <NoiseEee> jo_: the item you're dragging / clone should have a reference to the original element if you examine it
[09:12:27] <jo_> Hmm.
[09:12:40] <NoiseEee> ie: set a breakpoint in the debugger and inspect it :)
[09:12:42] <workmeh> why does jquery mobile say it uses ajax to load contents of each 'page' location.hash for an html document? There's no server involved
[09:12:46] <jo_> I have a breakpoint.
[09:12:52] <jo_> I'm looking at it, I just don't see the reference.
[09:13:05] <jo_> Or perhaps I'm looking at the reference and thinking it's the cloned element.
[09:14:11] <jo_> When the drop function is called, it gets an event, ui, and has 'this'.
[09:14:46] <jo_> If I pull the data for $.data(this, "blah"), I get back nothing.
[09:14:52] <jo_> On the original, though, I see the data.
[09:15:09] <jo_> ui.draggable also has the source object.
[09:15:14] <jo_> Or a clone thereof.
[09:15:26] <NoiseEee> right so can you call $.data on that?
[09:15:35] <jo_> Undefined.  :(
[09:17:06] <NoiseEee> you might have to $(ui.draggable) before querying for .data
[09:17:06] <jo_> Let me make sure it has the data set.
[09:17:11] <jo_> Oooh.
[09:17:13] <jo_> That might do it.
[09:17:14] <NoiseEee> its been a while since i've played with ui
[09:17:38] <Ximerian> hey everyone, is there any way to have jquery event listeners apply to new DOM objects that were created with .append() ?
[09:18:00] <jo_> Darn.
[09:18:02] <jo_> Nope.
[09:18:02] <NoiseEee> Ximerian: change your approach and use event delegation on the parent container
[09:18:24] <NoiseEee> Ximerian: $(commonParentReference).on(someEvent,'.classOfThingsOldAndNew',function() {})
[09:18:34] <jo_> I have the parent container handling on drop.
[09:18:42] <Ximerian> NoiseEee: Awesome, thank you!
[09:19:30] <jo_> I'm going to double check to make sure the items are getting the appropriate JS values.
[09:21:14] <jo_> I have another meeting.  Thank you very much for the help, though.  :)
[09:21:16] <jo_> I do appreciate it.
[09:22:20] <Ximerian> NoiseEee: Got it working. Exactly what I needed. Thank you so much.
[09:22:26] <NoiseEee> np good luck Ximerian
[09:22:33] <NoiseEee> np good luck jo_!
[09:30:00] <graphettion> In general, I just want to thank people like NoiseEee++. You take time out of your busy day to help people.
[09:30:21] <NoiseEee> awww thanks graphettion, appreciated
[09:30:56] <graphettion> NoiseEee, you're welcome. This is a great learning experience.
[09:31:21] <mikedoty> I'm using the Jquery UI Slider widget.  I want to trigger the "change" event any time the slide event fires, but I don't quite understand how to hook the events together properly http://paste2.org/w4cpLX4E
[09:33:09] <mikedoty> If I call $(widget).slider("values", values) in a side function it does fire the change event, but when I call it from within the slide function, it doesn't seem to fetch the same result
[09:33:27] <mikedoty> I'm not sure if I'm not allowed to call that from within the slide callback, or if I'm just sequencing it incorrectly perhaps
[09:33:38] <clov3r> mikedoty : try .trigger("change") instead of slidechange?
[09:34:23] <Lobosque> hey guys, how do I keep an image in the "center" when resizing while dragging? this is my try: http://jsfiddle.net/RnRyN/
[09:35:19] <mikedoty> It doesn't like that one either, clov3r :(
[09:35:30] <wilkinsmc> $('.nav').css('left', ((browserWidth / 2) - 386) + "px");
[09:35:41] <wilkinsmc> lobosque^^
[09:35:56] <wilkinsmc> just change the subtracted values until it's where you want
[09:36:24] <wilkinsmc> browserwidth doesn't need to be defined, jquery calculates the browser width
[09:37:14] <wilkinsmc> neways, i have a prob. I have a button set up that sets window.location = 'Home.html';, but it's going to index.html instead. Any ideas as to why this could be happening?
[09:37:39] <wilkinsmc> lobosque: but you have to call that line of code every so many ms
[09:38:02] <wilkinsmc> so set it in a function called set width and put this in document load area: setInterval(maintainWidth, 6);
[09:38:09] <wilkinsmc> will call it every 6 ms
[09:39:10] <mikedoty> Maybe Home.html doesn't exist (404 or a pathing issue) and it automatically redirects 404s to index.html?
[09:39:38] <wilkinsmc> it's in the same directory as the html file that's calling it
[09:40:03] <wilkinsmc> and that path works for the html file called Home.html to get to itself
[09:41:18] <mikedoty> My only ohter guess would be maybe the button is inside of a form and it's submitting the form to index.html and overriding the window.location set
[09:41:36] <Lobosque> wilkinsmc there is no other way around that?
[09:41:45] <Lobosque> that seems very hacky
[09:43:09] <wilkinsmc> works on my website
[09:43:13] <wilkinsmc> dunno if there's a better way
[09:43:26] <wilkinsmc> tried other things
[09:43:37] <wilkinsmc> i have everything repositioned that way
[09:43:45] <wilkinsmc> like 30 things. works good
[09:48:22] <wilkinsmc> mike: it's inside of a $('*').click that's inside of a if (mouseposition.x < z && mouseposition.x > y) {function() {}}
[09:48:33] <wilkinsmc> not a standard button, if you will
[09:48:47] <wilkinsmc> had to unbind click on mouse leave :P
[09:48:56] <wilkinsmc> but it was necessary because of all the animations on the menu bar
[09:56:01] <kosibar> If I define a callback with $(document).ajaxSuccess() then use $.get() with a callback function, what will happen? Does the $.get() callback override the $(document).ajaxSuccess() callback?
[09:56:02] <DaVinciIT> hi all. I'm looking for an OpenSource light html editor. can you suggest me one?
[09:56:39] <clov3r> sublime text 2
[10:03:32] <mikedoty> I created a separate callback function that holds the code I was placing in the change callback for the UI slider.  I execute f_callback() within both the slide and the change callbacks.  I think it's a little wonky, like the $.trigger("change") seemed logical, but it works.
[10:05:58] <darrennnn> DaVinciIT: what platform
[10:10:19] <sulav> I'm getting a 'jQuery is not defined' error but I have loaded jQuery at the very  beginning of the page? Any ideas?
[10:12:02] <Kuifje111> post some code that exhibits the behaviour
[10:12:17] <clov3r> apologies, st2 is not opensource
[10:12:36] <Kuifje111> sulav, that way we can reproduce it and see how it might be fixed
[10:13:18] <sulav> Kuifje111: I'll try to put something up on fiddle, thanks
[10:13:55] <recon_lap> hi all, I setup a infinite scroll using way points, the problem I'm having is that if the waypoint is visible when the page loads the ajax only gets called if i resize the window to move it off screen and back on again. any solution to this?
[10:14:03] <WrinkledCheese> I want to mimick the "status bar" at the bottom of the browser with jQuery ajax.  Basically, I'm trying to customize jQuery so taht at each of the ready states, I can update the text of an element to:
[10:14:03] <WrinkledCheese> Sending Request
[10:14:03] <WrinkledCheese> Connected to Server
[10:14:03] <WrinkledCheese> Response Received
[10:14:03] <WrinkledCheese> Downloading Response
[10:14:05] <WrinkledCheese> ?Finished.
[10:14:14] <WrinkledCheese> From what I can tell, I can only do 2 of those.
[10:14:55] <WrinkledCheese> I'm using jQuery 1.8.2 but I am looking at the source for 1.9.1.  has there been any updates to fully implement the other ready states for ajax in jQuery
[10:15:10] <WrinkledCheese> I'm not seeing any
[10:21:34] <darrennnn> WrinkledCheese: since your php or whatever is actually connecting to the server, how would javascript know
[10:21:48] <darrennnn> ajax doesnt work the way you are describing. at least in my knowledge
[10:22:27] <darrennnn> javascript taps your php on the shoulder and waits for a response. the php goes out connects receives, and sends back the response to you
[10:22:50] <darrennnn> which javascript brings back to the screen.
[10:23:12] <darrennnn> theres no middle ground where php shouts to you "hey im doing this. now i'm doing this." where you then return all of that indefinitely.
[10:23:25] <darrennnn> am i wrong?
[10:24:43] <lord4163> Hello :-)
[10:24:53] <jo_> Maybe with a hacky partial response trick, but for 99.999% of use cases, I think you're right darrennnn.
[10:25:01] <jo_> Ohai lord.
[10:25:05] <lord4163> Why won't the navigation work in Opera with jQuery Mobile? :P
[10:25:39] <jo_> Can you describe what you mean by 'not work'?  Does it not render or render improperly?
[10:26:09] <jo_> Or does it render but not interact?
[10:26:11] <WrinkledCheese> ajax sendsd a request(NOT PHP)  == Request Sent
[10:26:11] <WrinkledCheese> Server processes Request(most commonly Apache + PHP) == AJAX DOESN"T KNOW
[10:26:23] <WrinkledCheese> Server sends response headers
[10:26:23] <WrinkledCheese> ajax KNOWS
[10:26:29] <WrinkledCheese> response received
[10:26:30] <lord4163> <a href="#info">info</a>
[10:26:40] <lord4163> Does not work :(
[10:26:40] <WrinkledCheese> server sends payload == AJAX KNOWS
[10:26:54] <jo_> And you have your data-roles defined?
[10:26:57] <WrinkledCheese> == downloading response
[10:27:06] <WrinkledCheese> AJAX MUSt know of every step I mentioned
[10:27:08] <jo_> And you have names and IDs for your pages?
[10:27:15] <jo_> Or at the least IDs?
[10:27:41] <lord4163> jo_: yep, Opera is the only browser which has this issue
[10:27:55] <jo_> :( Lame.  Do you have a jsfiddle example?
[10:28:20] <lord4163> hmm could make one
[10:28:42] <darrennnn> WrinkledCheese: when your javascript sends the form info... does it ever know that the other page has received it and is processing it? no.
[10:28:46] <jo_> The simplest use case which fails...
[10:29:04] <darrennnn> WrinkledCheese: any information that it gets back is a response. and i think it only looks for one response.
[10:31:10] <jo_> Oshi-- I just realized I don't have Opera installed.  I was thinking Safari.  :|
[10:31:17] <jo_> Might take me a minute to look into that.
[10:34:17] <lord4163> jo_: hmmm strange :P
[10:35:21] <WrinkledCheese> darrennn: the server sends two responses.  1 is the header saying "expect this to follow" then it sends "this"
[10:36:08] <WrinkledCheese> sending request, connected to server, server does it's thing, sends headers of what to expect, sends what the headers described.
[10:37:47] <lord4163> jo_: ah well never mind, it might be my code which is buggy
[10:38:10] <jo_> It happens.
[10:43:42] <lord4163> jo_: idk what's wrong, but it works in Chrome and all others, http://jsfiddle.net/E9Y58/1/ something like that but this works actually :D
[10:45:22] <RNT> how can i force $(window).load to behave in IE as is doing in any other browser?
[10:57:48] <jo_> @lord4163 I don't think you need the extra OnClick for persons.
[10:58:04] <jo_> In fact, I think setting window location in the on click function will make it _not_ work.
[10:58:49] <jo_> Check it out with these changes: http://jsfiddle.net/E9Y58/1/
[10:59:43] <jo_> Yeah, it works without the $("#persons").on('click', â€¦).
[11:00:43] <jo_> Whoops.  Here's the change: http://jsfiddle.net/E9Y58/2/
[11:00:43] <aflag> hello. anyone knows of a plugin which allows me to upload files to the server without submiting the whole form?
[11:04:41] <PerlWebDev> aflag, sounds like using Ajax for form submission
[11:05:01] <PerlWebDev> and just have different forms for the different parts
[11:08:07] <NoiseEee> aflag: html5 / xhr2
[11:09:29] <gt3> In jQuery Mobile, does anyone know why when I click a link in the dialog to load #another-page) it reopens again the dialog again: $(document).on("pageinit",function(){ $.mobile.changePage("#intro-page",{transition:"pop", role:"dialog"}); });
[11:09:54] <gt3> wow i murdered that sentence
[11:09:59] <aflag> I was thinking about avoiding html5 since it's not available in every browser out there
[11:10:40] <tubbo> aflag: neither is CSS
[11:10:43] <tubbo> aflag: or JavaScript
[11:10:46] <gt3> aflag: newsflash, there is nothing that supports every browser out there
[11:11:18] <gt3> you just need to see what the majority of your target audience is using and support it as best you can. Perhaps using shims
[11:11:47] <tubbo> aflag: check out modernizr and html5 shim
[11:11:49] <tubbo> they work wonders
[11:12:34] <aflag> my audience mostly use ie >= 8 and chrome, I guess they both support html5, right?
[11:13:07] <gt3> aflag: also think about all the time and effort you'll put in to getting your site all xhtml and css2 and html4 and then everyone of your users upgrades next year and you're like oh crap, have to redo the whole site because it looks/acts outdated to my users now
[11:13:32] <gt3> aflag: you can totally use html5 then. Ie8 needs some special considerations though
[11:13:35] <NoiseEee> aflag: you can't use xhr2 with ie8/9
[11:13:55] <NoiseEee> aflag: that being said, you can do the 'old school' way and fake an ajax upload by targetting a hidden iframe, google about it
[11:14:10] <tmewett> hey guys
[11:14:11] <aflag> hm
[11:14:20] <aflag> thanks for the help
[11:14:46] <tmewett> i have run into a bit of a problem.
[11:14:54] <kba> I'm sing jQuery UI's droppable on a table. The cells are 5px tall, but the div I'm dragging might be 100 pixels tall, so when I drop it, I actually drop it on 20 different table cells. Draggable tells me, though, that I dropped it at the middle table cell. How do I make it drop it at the top table cell? I've been trying to calculate it myself, but it's really a hassle.
[11:16:56] <jo_> Okay.  I'm stuck.  I need to tie a JS object to a droppable item.
[11:17:08] <RNT> does somebody knows why IE won't take the command line in the order  they appears in the script?
[11:17:14] <jo_> I've tried using $.data, but that doesn't seem to work because I can't pull the data reference from ui.draggable.
[11:17:30] <sacho_> the command line?
[11:17:42] <RNT> yes, the lines of code i mean
[11:18:15] <tmewett> holy crap.
[11:18:31] <tmewett> .keydown() won't pass the event to the handler function.
[11:18:45] <tmewett> http://pastebin.com/rRuL19N9
[11:19:05] <sacho_> Please provide a test case, RNT.
[11:19:34] <sacho_> tmewett, pleasae provide a test case.
[11:19:52] <RNT> sacho_, open this page in IE and in something else and see when the alert message appears:
[11:19:53] <RNT> http://rntplayer.com/test3.php
[11:20:08] <tmewett> test case?
[11:20:26] <tmewett> http://www.mewett.co/ on this, pressing enter should make an ajax call.
[11:20:31] <tmewett> but it does nothing
[11:20:42] <tmewett> i don't think it's passing the event as an argument
[11:22:04] <sacho_> No, it's because you never bound a handler to anything.
[11:22:06] <tmewett> the func is on line 54 of the source
[11:22:13] <sacho_> Since when your code is executed, the input element doesn't exist.
[11:22:22] <tmewett> ah.
[11:22:27] <tmewett> ahhhhhhh.
[11:22:29] <sacho_> Use debugging tools next time
[11:22:37] <sacho_> chrome's are pretty good.
[11:22:46] <tmewett> i started on jquery literally an hour ago
[11:22:55] <tmewett> i have firebug - will that work?
[11:23:28] <tmewett> also sacho_ can i define the handler within $(document).ready() ?
[11:23:34] <foobear> Does anyone know of something like SyntaxHighlighter that also supports code collapsing?
[11:23:59] <sacho_> RNT, that's not really a test case.
[11:24:10] <RNT> why sacho_ ?
[11:24:11] <sacho_> tmewett, sure.
[11:24:17] <tmewett> awesome.
[11:24:22] <tmewett> thanks for the help man
[11:24:32] <sacho_> RNT, <ecmabot> A pared-down test case has the absolute minimum HTML, CSS, and JS needed to reproduce a problem. If you can delete any HTML, CSS, or JS and the problem still remains, you haven't pared it down fully. For best results, put your test case on http://jsfiddle.net and give us the URL.
[11:25:52] <RNT> sacho_, i can't do that, is too complex :(
[11:27:23] <WeskkTheHustler> asd
[11:27:25] <WeskkTheHustler> hi
[11:27:44] <RNT> the fact is simple like that, i have a $window(load) fuction within f1 and an alert on it, in any browser but IE, it firing first f1 and after that the alert,
[11:28:02] <RNT> in IE, it firing up the alert first
[11:28:16] <RNT> to me, this is a odd behavior
[11:28:32] <NoiseEee> rnt: which is why you're being asked to replicate it on jsfiddle
[11:29:18] <RNT> NoiseEee, i understund what he said, but i can't put all my page on jsfiddle, it makes no sense
[11:29:44] <afrance> You don't have to, just replicate the JS as stripped down as possible..
[11:29:46] <NoiseEee> rnt you put the piece of offending code / re-create what is happening with bare-minimum.  often by reducing it you find the issue
[11:30:04] <RNT> ahh, ok, wait
[11:30:05] <ezakimak> eliminating variables helps isolate the problem
[11:30:25] <jo_> I have a Javascript object which I'd like to bind to a jQuery Draggable.  When the drop function is called, I'd like to be able to get back the object with the ui.draggable passed into the object.
[11:30:39] <jo_> Had problems with $.data.  Anyone have suggestions?
[11:30:40] <ezakimak> sometimes you remove something you *thought* was unrelated and the problem disappears, exposing an unnoticed side-effect
[11:31:06] <RNT> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5510750
[11:31:41] <ezakimak> jo_, define "bind to a draggable"
[11:32:11] <sacho_> jo_, why didn't using data() work?
[11:32:20] <jo_> I'm getting undefined when I try and read it back.
[11:32:21] <ezakimak> also, you mention "the object" twice--they the same or two different objects?
[11:32:32] <sacho_> well, how are you placing it, and how are you reading it?
[11:32:53] <jo_> When I step through, I see the assignment and can pull it back, but can't seem to get it back from the ui.draggable reference.
[11:33:04] <jo_> It's like the item was cloned but has no recollection of the previous data assignment.
[11:33:44] <jo_> $.data(my_line_item_to_be_inserted_into_the_dom, "theVariableName", {myObject:"foo"})
[11:33:59] <jo_> When I read it back, draggable has a ui object passed into the handler.
[11:34:32] <jo_> ui.draggable points to something very similar to my_line_item_to_be_inserted_into_the_dom, but it doesn't return anything when I do $.data(ui.draggable, "theVariableName")
[11:34:36] <NoiseEee> jo_: you might want to explicitly add data on the source instead of with .data(), ie $(someThing).attr('data-somekey','someVal'); and just grab it by reading .attr
[11:34:52] <jo_> Oooh.  That's a good idea.
[11:35:08] <jo_> Will attr work with JS objects, too, or strings only?
[11:35:12] <RNT> NoiseEee, for me, any suggestion?
[11:35:26] <FrameFever> when I use the "find" method to search for an elemen, how can I check if the element was found?
[11:35:27] <NoiseEee> jo_: well just on DOM elements
[11:35:28] <jo_> RNT: Why are you using $(window).load instead of document ready?
[11:35:39] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: there will be a length to the result
[11:35:40] <RNT> jo_, it will be the same
[11:35:41] <sacho_> FrameFever, .length
[11:36:05] <RNT> window.load/document.ready, IE behaves different
[11:36:13] <jo_> I thought window load was called when the page was done loading, and document ready was called when the document was finished drawing.
[11:36:19] <sacho_> jo_, you are probably placing the data on the wrong object.
[11:36:24] <jo_> It's plausible.
[11:36:35] <sacho_> I should have said element, not object.
[11:36:48] <FrameFever> so I do something like this? var item = element.find(".es-caption"); if (item.length)
[11:36:55] <sacho_> try placing it on the draggable container, for example
[11:36:57] <jo_> I'll see if I can assign a generic item with the attr.  If I see that, I'll be able to match 'em up.
[11:37:02] <FrameFever> are you sure?
[11:37:21] <ezakimak> define draggable container
[11:37:35] <sacho_> FrameFever, you don't have to believe us, you can test it and read the documentation yourself
[11:38:07] <jo_> I just checked the assignment.  ui.draggable does, in fact, have an item with all the same classes, attributes, and children.
[11:38:43] <FrameFever> sacho_: do you have a link?
[11:38:58] <sacho_> google jquery length
[11:39:00] <FrameFever> I searched on the site: http://api.jquery.com/find/ for length
[11:39:06] <FrameFever> but didn't found anything
[11:39:11] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: its a natural JS property.
[11:39:28] <sacho_> Uh, not really
[11:39:32] <sacho_> FrameFever, http://api.jquery.com/?s=length
[11:39:35] <ezakimak> FrameFever, look under 'core' at jquery()--properties of selection lists
[11:39:36] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: if($(something).find('.selector').length===0) { //nothin there }
[11:39:59] <FrameFever> NoiseEee: that means find will always return an array element?
[11:40:12] <ezakimak> it returns a jq object
[11:40:17] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: all selectors return a jq object
[11:40:23] <NoiseEee> which has certain methods etc
[11:40:36] <ezakimak> which if it represents a list of matches, will have a length property > 0
[11:40:51] <ezakimak> and an element property which is an array
[11:41:10] <FrameFever> so when I have a jquery object, I have to use the "length" property to check if its valid or not?
[11:41:23] <ezakimak> define valid
[11:42:06] <FrameFever> valid is an jq object, when it belongs to a dom element
[11:42:06] <NoiseEee> rnt: don't use $(window).load , use jquery's ready() function
[11:42:11] <jessieJ> hi
[11:42:16] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: no, you're not quite getting it.
[11:42:18] <jessieJ> could u help with my fiddle
[11:42:26] <jessieJ> I am having a problem regarding calculation
[11:42:34] <jessieJ> here it is
[11:42:34] <jessieJ> http://jsfiddle.net/XC3w4/
[11:42:35] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: if there's a length, your selector found something.
[11:42:44] <NoiseEee> s/a length/a length!==0
[11:43:39] <RNT> NoiseEee, you mean $(document).ready(function() ?
[11:43:41] <jo_> I agree with NoiseEee.  jQuery's ready is the way to go.
[11:43:48] <jo_> Yes.
[11:44:13] <RNT> makes no difference
[11:44:16] <jessieJ> hello
[11:44:17] <jessieJ> ?
[11:44:38] <RNT> IE still does the stuff in its way
[11:45:01] <pachet> i want that on a shirt
[11:45:01] <NoiseEee> rnt $(function() { //all your load stuff here })
[11:45:31] <jo_> :(
[11:45:44] <RNT> is done like you said, NoiseEee
[11:45:48] <NoiseEee> jessieJ: and your issue is?
[11:46:05] <jessieJ> calculation
[11:46:13] <ezakimak> all your base are belong to ready :)
[11:46:19] <jessieJ> am sorry I'm kinda new with this
[11:46:46] <NoiseEee> rnt: you'll have to come up with a decent fiddle, its hard to provide you with any help at all RNT.
[11:46:59] <RNT> NoiseEee, you can take a look at the source of http://rntplayer.com/test3.php
[11:46:59] <NoiseEee> what about calculation, jessieJ
[11:47:15] <RNT> it wuould be much easy to understand
[11:47:30] <jessieJ> it's not working NoiseEee
[11:47:52] <NoiseEee> rnt.  I don't see $(function() {}) being used.
[11:47:56] <NoiseEee> sorry i have paying work to do
[11:48:15] <NoiseEee> jessieJ: and explain your ISSUE.  people aren't going to be playing with your fiddle trying to see what "not working" means.
[11:48:40] <jessieJ> yeah what I wanted to achieve was to make live calculation per row
[11:50:29] <Z3R0> JesseC your current problem is...
[11:50:39] <Z3R0> $('.qty', row).val()* // isn't returning a value
[11:50:48] <Z3R0> alert($('.qty',row).val()); // undefined
[11:51:16] <jessieJ> yeah it's done now
[11:51:18] <FrameFever> how can I check if a var is an jquery element?
[11:51:20] <jessieJ> thanks folks
[11:51:32] <FrameFever> -element object
[11:51:36] <JesseC> It's not my problem. :)
[11:51:58] <Z3R0> lolz
[11:51:59] <Z3R0> rofl
[11:52:04] <Z3R0> sorry JesseC lol damn tab
[11:52:37] <JesseC> Z3R0: Yeah, np ha.
[11:54:25] <FrameFever> NoiseEee: do you know it?
[11:54:26] <RNT> ok, i tested again with  $(function() {}, same result :(
[11:56:36] <Z3R0> rny got fiddl e?
[11:56:42] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: what are you trying to do?  what problem are you trying to solve?
[11:56:44] <Z3R0> too hard to help without a fiddle
[11:58:04] <FrameFever> NoiseEee: I found if (item instanceof jQuery)
[11:58:10] <FrameFever> is this the correct approach?
[11:58:15] <NoiseEee> to what?!
[11:58:18] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: what are you trying to do?  what problem are you trying to solve?
[11:58:32] <FrameFever> I have an object which can be a string
[11:58:36] <FrameFever> or an jquery object
[11:58:46] <NoiseEee> you mean a variable which can be a string or jquery object?
[11:58:51] <Z3R0> NoiseEee maybe you should just take a breather lol... these guys are going to kill you
[11:58:54] <FrameFever> when it is a jquery object I append it to another one
[11:59:04] <FrameFever> otherwhise I use the text methode to set the string
[11:59:12] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: so sure, use instanceof
[11:59:15] <FrameFever> NoiseEee: yes
[12:01:49] <RNT> Z3R0 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a0eebf7e6b2fe5d4cf59
[12:05:18] <NoiseEee> RNT: a reduced test case. on jsfiddle.
[12:05:43] <NoiseEee> rnt: also dump the try/catch BS
[12:05:47] <RNT> NoiseEee, you had one, and you didn't like it :(
[12:05:56] <RNT> what i have to do?
[12:05:58] <RNT> :(
[12:06:15] <NoiseEee> you need to learn how to debug. http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:07:58] <RNT> in IE the alert fires up before $("#list, .listContent").mCustomScrollbar({ function is executed, i think this is my problem
[12:11:31] <jo_> Whoo!  Found it!
[12:11:48] <jo_> Using the $.data selector to assign data wasn't working, but $(myObject).data was.
[12:12:06] <jo_> Looks like, for reasons unknown, $.data(myObject, "foo", "bar") was losing the data after clone.
[12:12:17] <jo_> $(myObject).data("foo", "bar") is.
[12:20:31] <madprops> http://radpaste.com/578/ should fc be available inside the function?
[12:23:49] <NoiseEee> madprops: yes
[12:24:14] <NoiseEee> sweet jo_
[12:26:59] <jo_> Thanks for your help, everyone.
[12:34:02] <BillCriswell> Just came across status code 418 for the first time, haha
[12:37:46] <benlieb> How can I remove an element from the dom, store it in a var, and put it back later if needed?
[12:38:53] <BillCriswell> benlieb: You can use .remove()
[12:39:25] <benlieb> BillCriswell: tnx I'll check that out.
[12:39:32] <BillCriswell> benlieb: I think you can do var $someDiv = $('.someDiv').remove();
[12:40:02] <pachet> also see .detach
[12:40:05] <pachet> ?.detach()
[12:40:25] <pachet> simon, theodore....
[12:40:27] <pachet> BOT-T..
[12:40:35] <BillCriswell> That seems much safer than remove.
[12:40:41] <benlieb> I looked at the docs and it's not obvious how to put it back if needed
[12:41:04] <pachet> benlieb: once you have a reference to the element that's detached you can use normal methods to reattach it
[12:41:07] <tw2113> append() ?
[12:41:10] <pachet> ^
[12:41:34] <pachet> .html(detachedElement); detachedElement.appendTo(parent); etc
[12:41:45] <BillCriswell> benlieb: The same way I just used remove() would work.
[12:42:32] <benlieb> BillCriswell: my comment was in reference to your suggestion. It's not clear how I would reattach.
[12:42:39] <rightleaf> var old = $('#old');  $('#old').remove();â€¦  $('#newparent').append($(old));
[12:43:17] <Lucaszz> Are any possibilities to send form without page reload ?
[12:43:20] <BillCriswell> benlieb: It's just a jQuery object. var $div = $('div').detach(); $newPlace.append($div);
[12:43:25] <rightleaf> once you assing to a variable, you are storing a refernce in memory.. removing it from the dom keeps it in memory
[12:43:41] <benlieb> Ok thanks guys, I'll look into all these possibilities...
[12:43:42] <pachet> remove() will remove event handlers and expando properties
[12:43:45] <pachet> benlieb^
[12:43:45] <rightleaf> but wont be available by selector anymore since its not a dom element
[12:44:01] <benlieb> pachet: detach() seems the way to go for what i need...
[12:44:11] <BillCriswell> Yeah, forget remove, go for detach. =)
[12:44:15] <BillCriswell> I need a beer.
[12:44:20] <pachet> me too
[12:44:35] <benlieb> :)
[12:45:48] <BillCriswell> Boss picked up a case of Founders Centennial IPA. Great choice.
[12:46:22] <BillCriswell> and strong enough that I don't need to drink 30 of them. I love Friday.
[12:46:42] <benlieb> would be awesome if there was a reattach() method, instead of tracking where it was to begin with and using appendTo(). But I guess there's pretty good reasons for that...
[12:47:57] <graphettion> Hello all, does anyone know how to fade out a video and fade in text after it? It's not working for me - http://jsfiddle.net/bbgpK/
[12:47:59] <pachet> a good ipa is a good friend
[12:48:17] <pachet> i've been all about caldera lately
[12:50:04] <rightleaf> graphettion http://jsfiddle.net/R9h4W/1/
[12:50:20] <jo_> Caldera?  The law?
[12:50:21] <BillCriswell> pachet: Can't say I've tried that yet.
[12:50:29] <jo_> Oh.
[12:51:01] <BillCriswell> jo_: It's a beer.
[12:51:07] <graphettion> rightleaf: Does the text fade in after the video?
[12:51:14] <rightleaf> sorry. http://jsfiddle.net/R9h4W/2/
[12:51:24] <rightleaf> i didnt catch the parent call
[12:51:55] <graphettion> rightleaf: np, thank you so much!!! rightleaf++
[12:51:57] <rightleaf> haha.. sorry. http://jsfiddle.net/R9h4W/3/
[12:52:03] <zizzl> anyone know a good plugin to stick the main nav to the top of the window of a mobile browser and have it drop down?
[12:52:15] <rightleaf> your show/hide killed the fade effect
[12:53:15] <graphettion> rightleaf: I'm such a newb.
[13:01:03] <BillCriswell> zizzl: Can you be a bit more specific? Not sure what you mean by "drop down"?
[13:01:43] <BillCriswell> You can fix an element to the top of the window with position: fixed; but I can't tell if you mean put dropdown menus in the fixed element or something completely different.
[13:01:50] <zizzl> Well it's a pretty popular technique, on responsive websites, when it's a smaller screen the man nav turns into a drop down on click
[13:03:34] <BillCriswell> So like what bootstrap does with their menu button?
[13:03:51] <BillCriswell> http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/ with a fixed topbar basically?
[13:06:10] <BillCriswell> fixed topbar on small screens*
[13:14:23] <hxm> jquery ui is similar to jquerymobile?
[13:19:45] <pachet> in some ways
[13:19:52] <Zzaichik> not really
[13:20:16] <Zzaichik> it can do some similar things, but jquery mobile targets mobile gestures
[13:20:32] <Zzaichik> i.e. swipe, touch, etc. and jquery ui does not
[13:22:19] <zizzl> BillCriswell, um exactly.
[13:22:20] <zizzl> haha
[13:23:01] <jo_> Oh god I just tested my app in Firefox and everything is wrong.  D:
[13:23:07] <Z3R0> rofl
[13:23:12] <Z3R0> poor jo_
[13:23:25] <jo_> Does Chrome handle Ajax differently?
[13:23:30] <Z3R0> no?
[13:23:34] <jo_> It's working there.
[13:23:38] <Z3R0> o.o
[13:23:42] <BillCriswell> zizzl: Can you get what you need from bootstrap or want it stripped to the bare essentials?
[13:23:44] <Z3R0> maybe ff screwed something up? check console?
[13:23:46] <jo_> Looks like everything is happening sequentially in FF.
[13:23:52] <Z3R0> oooo
[13:24:05] <jo_> Chrome: "IT IS DONE."
[13:24:10] <jo_> FireFox: "EXPLODE EVERYTHING."
[13:24:13] <Z3R0> lol
[13:24:17] <jo_> IE: "DURRR!"
[13:24:25] <Z3R0> IE: is just a shit storm no matter what you do
[13:24:29] <NoiseEee> jo_: it a question of async/callbacks and timing differences between the two browsers?
[13:24:30] <jo_> Opera: "Trololololo."
[13:24:35] <jo_> I wouldn't have thought.
[13:24:48] <jo_> I'm waiting for a callback to fire my events, but it looks like the dataâ€¦ isn't there.
[13:25:00] <jo_> Except I see the post request coming back.
[13:25:03] <jo_> Iâ€¦ wat?
[13:25:24] <NoiseEee> you know you can't get the data until the callback right?
[13:25:31] <jo_> Right.
[13:25:44] <zizzl> BILLCriswell, would be nice if the menu code was stripped, but I'm sure it's out there
[13:25:52] <NoiseEee> well maybe step-through / play with moar console jo_ :)
[13:25:58] <jo_> I'm going to have to.
[13:26:15] <jo_> It's just kind of a WTF GDFPOS moment.  I so rarely have problems with FF being a butt.
[13:40:19] <jo_> Ugh.  Firefox specific bug.
[13:40:29] <jo_> In Firebug, I put a breakpoint on a function which is hit four times.
[13:40:46] <jo_> If I hit 'continue' on the first run, it skips it on all subsequent runs.
[13:40:51] <jo_> Am I being dumb?
[13:41:39] <cenwesi> hello everyone
[13:41:44] <jo_> Ohai!
[13:42:20] <norbert_> hi all, a jquery post request fails in IE (it's not updating the HTML) but without an error, even the jquery error function returns nothing
[13:42:26] <cenwesi> can someone help me out... i am trying to export an jqgrid table to CSV file. I can't seem to find version that works out there.
[13:42:33] <norbert_> not sure what to do next, have been checking Google for answers for hours
[13:43:01] <Toerkeium> hello guys. I'm using jquery-ui and every element I set its style to float, it goes out of my jquery-ui tabs. Do you know how can I fix this?
[13:43:03] <clov3r> norbert: got a link/fiddle?
[13:43:38] <norbert_> clov3r: it works in all browsers but not in IE
[13:43:43] <norbert_> even works with iPhone
[13:44:17] <NoiseEee> norbert_: crystal ball... fuzzy. ESP... not working
[13:45:29] <Toerkeium> I'm just trying to put to divs one at a side of the other but I can't. If I use float, both divs goes out of the jquery-ui tab
[13:47:11] <cenwesi> Toerkeium.. try using margin.... ie margin-left:10px...
[13:49:19] <Toerkeium> cenwesi: but if I don't use float, one div is down the other
[13:50:04] <cenwesi> is ur code hosted anyway?
[13:50:11] <cenwesi> anywhere
[13:50:49] <joelataylor> so my show() / hide() works once, then stops working. same function calls these methods, I'm at a loss why they wouldn't work anymore â€¦ thoughts?
[13:51:10] <Toerkeium> cenwesi: no i don't have it posted anywhere. The problem is that if I use float which makes what I want, put both divs outside the jquery-ui tabs
[13:57:36] <Toerkeium> I think I would need some element which could contain inside 2 floating divs, not sure if thats possible
[14:04:46] <x64_nicole> Can someone help me determine where the "crystalcommerce.com" images are coming from on this page? articles.alterealitygames.com/the-physicians-recommendation-skill-beast-beat-and-six-samurai/ - http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130503_J5_11YK/1/details/ - I don't see them ANYWHERE. ):
[14:07:13] <Pilate> x64_nicole: chrome says theyre coming from jquery.js
[14:07:38] <x64_nicole> Yeah, I got that far. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but I'm not a jQuery master. :3
[14:08:05] <Pilate> http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?callback=jQuery18307715777795865264_1367615251530&q=select+*+from+html+where+url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fyugioh.alterealitygames.com%2F%22+and+xpath%3D%22*%22+and+compat%3D%22html5%22&format=xml&_=1367615251544
[14:08:15] <Pilate> is returning html with them inside it
[14:10:11] <Toerkeium> cenwesi: I've made an example, do you know where can I upload the code ? any webpage which parse html/css?
[14:11:38] <Toerkeium> anyway, it's not a jquery issue, I thought it was
[14:14:09] <norbert_> in an $.ajax({ POST request, I'm trying to add several variables name=test&name2=test and so on, and one of those is empty; IE says "name2 is undefined on line 202; do you think this could be the cause of the code not working on IE? or is that more of a warning than an error... I'm unfamiliar with IE :|
[14:14:55] <NoiseEee> norbert_: pastebin that part of your code somewhere
[14:17:02] <norbert_> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/dMNzx7NJ
[14:17:43] <norbert_> <input type="text" id="name1"> is empty
[14:18:09] <norbert_> this code works in Firefox, Chrome (Chromium) and Opera, but not in IE
[14:18:47] <NoiseEee> norbert_: i can't imagine that working anywhere (properly)
[14:19:01] <NoiseEee> norbert_: where/what is name1 being defined
[14:19:21] <norbert_> NoiseEee: an <input type="text" id="name1">
[14:19:30] <NoiseEee> norbert_: yeah well then get it that way
[14:19:43] <NoiseEee> the function has no idea what "name1.value" is, much less "name1"
[14:19:57] <norbert_> getElementByID, you mean?
[14:20:03] <NoiseEee> sure.
[14:20:23] <NoiseEee> encodeURIComponent($('input[name="name1"]').val())
[14:20:49] <NoiseEee> norbert_: i'd be surprised if despite the lack of error notice, the value you intended to have was actually used.
[14:21:10] <norbert_> NoiseEee: it works fine in all other browsers, believe it or not :)
[14:21:34] <norbert_> probably workarounds they put in the browsers, now that you mention all that stuff, I'm surprised it worked too
[14:27:25] <x64_nicole> Wow. I've no idea how to even work with this. Lol.
[14:28:46] <abjorn> dog, why must you poop all over the floor, whyyyy
[14:32:43] <dylanm312_> hi
[14:33:04] <dylanm312_> i need help with some programming
[14:33:12] <dylanm312_> lolo
[14:40:53] <rebel_yell> hey i was wondering how do i disable scroll on a page when i enter a frame
[14:40:54] <rebel_yell> http://legacyny.com/listings
[14:40:59] <rebel_yell> site for refrence
[14:41:06] <rebel_yell> see the latest posts
[14:41:18] <rebel_yell> when you mouse in it should only be scrolling in that frame
[14:41:25] <rebel_yell> but it scrolls the whole page
[14:42:52] <Forbidd3n> I can't remember what it is called to lookup but a check to toggle hide/show based on a value
[14:43:05] <Forbidd3n> (...).toggle(...)
[14:43:29] <norbert_> $( "#effect" ).toggle
[14:43:38] <norbert_> jquery ui, see http://jqueryui.com/toggle/
[14:44:11] <norbert_> if that's not what you mean, you need to clarify your problem/question
[14:45:44] <rebel_yell> it is what i mean
[14:45:54] <rebel_yell> so i need to toggle overflow?
[14:46:03] <rebel_yell> or toggle scrollable
[14:46:17] <norbert_> rebel_yell: I was addressing Forbidd 3 n, not you :)
[14:47:33] <rebel_yell> oo ok cool
[14:49:56] <Memolition> rebel_yell:  try it with css position: fixed
[14:50:08] <Memolition> over all the div you want fixed
[14:50:09] <rebel_yell> tried that
[14:50:51] <Memolition> and what is the problem?
[14:51:15] <Memolition> or you can try to add overflow to the content you want to scrol
[14:51:19] <Memolition> *scroll*
[14:52:20] <rebel_yell> tried that as well
[14:52:23] <rebel_yell> so i have used this code
[14:52:31] <rebel_yell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7585031/div-overflowscroll-disable-page-scroll-whilst-mouse-is-inside
[14:52:41] <rebel_yell> and now it doesnt scroll
[14:52:44] <rebel_yell> the page
[14:52:58] <rebel_yell> but the frame also doesnt scroll
[14:53:35] <Memolition> you have the content inside a div or an ifram?
[14:53:37] <Memolition> iframe
[14:53:58] <rebel_yell> div
[14:54:24] <rebel_yell> div is called scroll wrapper
[14:54:24] <rebel_yell> #scroll_wrapper{   position:fixed;   width:300px;    height:100%;    overflow-y:scroll; }
[14:54:42] <fonko> guys is there any fast way to only take the last click from an ajax call? and fier only that click?
[14:55:23] <fonko> im thinking of a queue of request and also a time of like 2 seconds and from that queue only take the last click... but no idea if that could be posible
[14:55:55] <fonko> my site has many ajax calls and if a user goes crazy with clicks everything moves around and i end up getting a HUGE json of data
[14:56:04] <fonko> www.warnermusic.com.mx
[14:57:54] <f0ster> hello, I am trying to add an attribute 'value' to an anchor tag, via the $.prop function, but for some reason, value does not get set, https://gist.github.com/f0ster/5514517
[14:59:17] <rebel_yell> ugh
[14:59:25] <rebel_yell> i can figure this stupid thing out
[14:59:49] <rebel_yell> lol i pretty much want to do the side bar here
[14:59:50] <rebel_yell> ll
[15:02:48] <Memolition> rebel_yell: take a look at this
[15:02:50] <Memolition> http://jsbin.com/emejab/7
[15:03:23] <rebel_yell> but thats a fixed side bar
[15:03:28] <rebel_yell> i need the sidebar to be scrollable
[15:04:07] <rebel_yell> is there anyway to simulate page bottom
[15:04:09] <Memolition> make it absolute to!
[15:04:12] <rebel_yell> but not actually go to page bottom?
[15:04:48] <norbert_> NoiseEee: OMG, it now works in IE, thanks _so_ much
[15:05:15] <graphettion> Someone's happy. :O
[15:05:16] <rebel_yell> make it absolute and fixed
[15:06:13] <Forbidd3n> norbert_: I am trying to put in kind of a ternary check in jquery to toggle
[15:07:02] <graphettion> rebel_yell: Explain your problem better as if I went to your page and loaded it up. What next?
[15:07:09] <Forbidd3n> I can't remember the syntax
[15:07:20] <Forbidd3n> .(if(...)).toggle()
[15:07:39] <Forbidd3n> I know that isn't correct, just trying to get my objective across
[15:07:48] <rebel_yell> ok
[15:07:53] <rebel_yell> so see how to scroll bar
[15:08:03] <rebel_yell> see the recent posts
[15:08:19] <rebel_yell> it only scrolls when the page has gotten all the way to the bottom
[15:08:50] <norbert_> Forbidd3n: I'm not a native English speaker, still no idea what you want to do, what should the effect be, the actual functionality
[15:09:12] <Forbidd3n> norbert_: I want to do an inline condition statement in jqueyr
[15:09:13] <Forbidd3n> jquery
[15:09:29] <Memolition> rebel_yell: http://jsbin.com/emejab/11  ?
[15:10:11] <clov3r> Forbidd3n: fiddle it with a more context
[15:10:32] <norbert_> Forbidd3n: please upload the relevant code portions to either fiddle or pastebin.com
[15:10:58] <Forbidd3n> clov3r: that is the problem I can't remember the syntax
[15:11:26] <Memolition> Forbidd3n: what are you trying to do?
[15:11:31] <clov3r> well good luck :)
[15:11:41] <Memolition> you want to check what to toggle what?
[15:11:50] <clov3r> what are you testing?
[15:12:02] <clov3r> can you do it not inline?
[15:12:04] <Forbidd3n> Memolition: I am trying to do an inline check if/else something like this - .(if(...)).toggle()
[15:12:04] <norbert_> Forbidd3n: yeah, you need to describe what you want to do, now what you think the code looks like or that you call it an inline conditional statement
[15:12:15] <clov3r> what is the prior function in the chain
[15:12:46] <rebel_yell> Memolition: no salt
[15:12:54] <norbert_> Forbidd3n: $(element).is(":visible") maybe?
[15:13:00] <rebel_yell> graphettion: hey did you check it out
[15:13:04] <clov3r> and if you say 'anything' i'll slap you with a stinky tuna :P
[15:14:00] <graphettion> tuna slap!
[15:14:13] <graphettion> rebel_yell: Yeah, I still don't understand your problem.
[15:14:29] <graphettion> Not sure why you have a scrollable div in the first place.
[15:14:52] <Forbidd3n> basically I want to toggle hide/show an element based on a selection of an element
[15:14:55] <rebel_yell> when i mouse ovr
[15:14:58] <rebel_yell> over
[15:15:05] <Forbidd3n> I can do it the long way
[15:15:11] <rebel_yell> it should be able to scroll
[15:15:29] <graphettion> when your mouse is over the did you know div?
[15:15:39] * clov3r slaps Forbidd3n with a stinky tuna (that's semantically equivalent!)
[15:15:43] <Forbidd3n> anyone here a jquery guru, you would know what I am trying to do
[15:16:00] <Forbidd3n> sorry I can't explain it exactly
[15:16:02] <Memolition> Forbidd3n: that element has some shared class? or is a <select>?
[15:16:14] <kba> I'm sing jQuery UI's droppable on a table. The cells are 5px tall, but the div I'm dragging might be 100 pixels tall, so when I drop it, I actually drop it on 20 different table cells. Draggable tells me, though, that I dropped it at the middle table cell. How do I make it drop it at the top table cell?
[15:16:31] <Forbidd3n> based on select value, show/hide elements that hold a class
[15:16:49] <Jon47> kba:  I'm pretty sure it has to do with where your cursor is when you drop the element
[15:17:36] <Jon47> you can control where the "helper" element sits relative to the cursor as you drag it using the "cursorAt" property, at least if you're using sortables..
[15:17:36] <clov3r> forbidd3n: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[15:18:25] <Jon47> yeah, draggable has that property too
[15:19:12] <kba> Jon47: from my testing, it doesn't care about cursor position
[15:19:37] <Jon47> curious - i've never anything like the use case you describe
[15:19:42] <Forbidd3n> clov3r, Memolition, norbert_: there has to be a better way to write this - http://jsfiddle.net/EzmW5/
[15:19:53] <Jon47> kba is there a url i can test at?
[15:19:54] <kba> Jon47: yeah, it definitely doesn't care about cursor position. I tried dragging this box from the bottom and from the top - it drops the exact same place and there's like 150px inbetween the top and bottom
[15:20:41] <kba> Jon47: I just sent you a notice. Click the blue button in the corner.
[15:20:56] <kba> Jon47: Then you'll see a calendar. Try to drag around movies in the calendar.
[15:22:00] <Jon47> kba - yeah it seems to be using the top-left position of the element to determine which cell it drops into
[15:22:08] <Jon47> pretty intuitive UI actually
[15:22:17] <kba> Jon47: Well, no, it doesn't. That's a correction I've made.
[15:22:26] <Jon47> ah
[15:22:34] <kba> Jon47: I'm taking the height of the box, dividing it by 2, then calculating the spot it should end up in.
[15:22:56] <kba> Jon47: and it seemed to work, but I'm running into another problem that I was thinking might have something to do with my manual correction
[15:23:05] <kba> Jon47: so I'm trying to eliminate that correction.
[15:23:31] <kba> Jon47: the actual problem is that my table is built with 5 minute intervals as you can see in the source code.
[15:23:57] <kba> Jon47: Even though there's only a line for every 15th minute, there are tables for every 5 minute. I want to be able to drop a movie into a 5 minute interval, not just the 15 minute intervals.
[15:24:20] <kba> Jon47: But for some reason it won't let me and I can't for the life of me figure out why. I've been trying to solve this problem for about 4 hours or so in total now.
[15:25:14] <kba> Jon47: Actually, when I remove the offset I calculated myself, the problem persists, so I don't really know what is try - and why I can't drop it in the 5 minute intervals.
[15:25:19] <kba> So I guess my original question is moot.
[15:26:10] <Jon47> kba: I don't see any options in the api docs to customize how it determines where you dragged to
[15:26:29] <Jon47> so you might be stuck with what you've got, but it seems to be working pretty well for me
[15:26:41] <kba> Jon47: Neither do I, but as I just said it seems that that isn't really the source of my bug after all.
[15:26:42] <Jon47> I'm sure the 15m vs 5m problem will be trivial to resolve
[15:27:24] <kba> Jon47: That is the problem I've actually been trying to solve for about 4 hours in total
[15:27:31] <kba> So not really... ;)
[15:27:35] <Jon47> uf
[15:27:48] <kba> And it seems stupid. It should be trivial.
[15:28:06] <kba> I did initially built the code for 15 minute intervals, so it might be some residue from that. I just can't figure out where it is.
[15:29:09] <Jon47> kba:  did you try playing with the grid and snap to options?
[15:30:17] <kba> Jon47: Yup. Same result.
[15:30:29] <kba> Jon47: Right now I got this grid to 6 pixels which is the height of each cell.
[15:31:01] <kba> Jon47: The odd part is that if you look at column B, for instance (if you're still on the page), it'll snap to the "old times", like 00, 15, 30, 45.
[15:31:27] <kba> But in column C (which starts at 15:45, it will instead snap to 10, 25, 40, 55
[15:31:42] <kba> I can't for the life of me figure out why in God's name it would do that.
[15:32:23] <kba> So I'd expect either both of them to snap to something where n % 15 = 0.
[15:32:41] <kba> What is wrong with you, you dumbass code.
[15:33:03] * xfire good night :)
[15:35:50] <Jon47> i'm not expert with draggables, but i wish you luck sir
[15:37:33] <kba> thanks for the help and encouragement
[15:37:36] <kba> :)
[15:51:32] <jmmy> is there an ajax bug with IE9, my ajax script works great everywhere except IE 9
[15:56:25] <tw2113> have you tried googling the bug first?
[15:56:32] <tw2113> or js errors showing up
[15:58:09] <jmmy> tw2113, yeah I am googling
[15:59:12] <tw2113> another helpful tip...give the room the error you're seeing
[15:59:20] <tw2113> maybe someone knows the fix
[16:05:38] <jmmy> I didn't use any tools to get an error
[16:06:06] <tw2113> so you have no idea what any errors are for it, you just know "it no work!"
[16:06:27] <tw2113> ?
[16:06:50] <jmmy> tw2113, yes
[16:07:15] <tw2113> as much as they may suck compared to firebug and chrome dev tools, fire up IE's dev tools and see what it reports at all
[16:07:25] <jmmy> Yes, my client side validation works, but it doesn't send, so it breaks at the ajax part
[16:07:44] <jmmy> hmm, I don't have IE here, my customer showed me on his laptop
[16:08:12] <jmmy> maybe this will work: http://mvcdiary.com/2013/01/16/jquery-ajax-request-not-working-in-ie9/
[16:08:49] <tw2113> worth a shot
[16:17:57] <quietschie> hi, sry may sound stupid, but how can i find every tag with an id attribute within a dom element?
[16:20:03] <fikst> quietschie, there can only be 1 tag with a specific id
[16:20:18] <fikst> $('#id')
[16:20:31] <tw2113> i think quietschie was asking how to select any that have an ID attribute
[16:20:34] <tw2113> not a specific ID
[16:20:40] <quietschie> yes thanks
[16:20:48] <fikst> ah, k
[16:21:08] <quietschie> i guess find() does that?
[16:22:19] <fikst> $('[id]')
[16:22:54] <fikst> http://jsfiddle.net/E6FjK/
[16:25:18] <quietschie> thanks fikst!
[16:29:24] <jmmy> How would I do this: # pass the default character set, AddDefaultCharset utf-8 , in the html ?

[17:27:31] <PREFIX|> is there anyway to do something like. var myObj = $('#div'); myObj.customProperty = "value"; myObj.on('click', function() { MyFunc(this) } );  var MyFunc = function(Param) { console.log(Param.customProperty); } ?
[17:27:40] <PREFIX|> if that makes sense >_<
[17:43:20] <wykydtron> hm, for whatever reason my show() isn't removing overflow:hidden
[17:43:29] <wykydtron> i ended up just throwing .css("overflow","visible") in on complete
[17:43:56] <wykydtron> A different instances, it wouldn't leave it hidden, strange
[17:46:11] <maahacka> wykydtron: showing elements has nothing to do with the scrollbar
[17:46:21] <maahacka> I would expect exactly this behaviour
[17:46:41] <maahacka> element visibility != scrollbar visibility

[18:02:19] <Possibilities> ...what
[18:03:58] <brutalhonesty> Possibilities: i would setup an onclick listener instead of all those onclick attributes on each element
[18:04:16] <Possibilities> How would I go about doing that?
[18:04:37] <brutalhonesty> you could include at the top of your script
[18:04:48] <brutalhonesty> $('li').each(function(){});
[18:04:52] <brutalhonesty> and inside there
[18:05:09] <brutalhonesty> $(this).on('click' function(){});
[18:06:20] <Possibilities> ok

[19:04:25] <jmmy> Anyone know how to fix $.ajax() to work with ie9?
[19:04:35] <Possibilities> yes, and i tried it.

[19:45:29] <PREFIX|> Anyone here actually know how to use .data() ? Cause I can't get it to work for the life of me, atleast not $.data, maybe it's a scope issue or something.
[19:47:54] <tw2113> maybe you need to use a selector for the dom element you want to get the data attribute from
[19:48:41] <PREFIX|> I'm trying to set a data element and use it as a cache to somehow couple two different doms in an event
[19:52:27] <graphettion> Why are you all here? It's iday night.
[19:52:32] <graphettion> Friday*
[19:52:50] <tw2113> webdevs...no social life, duh
[19:52:58] <graphettion> lol
[19:53:15] <graphettion> What's something to create...
[19:53:29] <tw2113> $()
[19:53:42] <graphettion> That does nothing.
[19:54:16] <tw2113> recreate IRC with backbone.js
[19:54:29] <graphettion> The point?
[19:54:38] <tw2113> it's something to create
[19:54:49] <graphettion> Needs to have a purpose.
[19:55:00] <tw2113> IRC client isn't a purpose?
[19:55:12] <graphettion> That's re-inventing the wheel.
[19:55:32] <tw2113> you never said "something NEW to create"
[19:56:10] <graphettion> touche
[19:58:32] <jmmy> why doesn't ajax work in ie
[20:01:13] <tw2113> why can't you use IE's dev tools to see errors that it's generating and use those to debug your woes
[20:01:38] <tw2113> many other people have made ajax work just fine with IE
[20:09:25] <jmmy> tw2113, I'm trying
[20:12:56] <tw2113> what's an error you've found
[20:14:14] <jmmy> its not giving error, maybe I'm not using it right
[20:15:18] <tw2113> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg589530%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[20:16:54] <jmmy> I dont see any errors in the console
[20:18:06] <tw2113> refreshed the page?
[20:18:18] <tw2113> with the console tab open
[20:18:30] <jmmy> yes, but I'll try again
[20:18:57] <madprops> I wonder if chrome can set up to send data to the clipboard via js
[20:19:08] <madprops> can set up a way*
[20:19:21] <madprops> and every other browser
[20:19:29] <jmmy> tw2113, no errors
[20:19:31] <tw2113> jmmy, pretty much have IE9 + console tab active, and then try to use the ajax the way you need it to work
[20:19:43] <tw2113> if it's triggered on some click, do the click
[20:19:46] <tw2113> and observer the console
[20:20:39] <jmmy> yep, I get no errors
[20:21:16] <tw2113> *shrug*
[20:21:25] <tw2113> i don't have IE9 available, just IE10
[20:21:31] <tw2113> and that's on a different computer
[20:21:58] <jmmy> tw2113, It doesn't work in ie8 and ie9
[20:22:47] <tw2113> *shrug*
[20:22:54] <tw2113> i try to forget IE exists
[20:23:13] <ddaymace_> ie10 is actually decent
[20:23:21] <ddaymace_> took them long enough
[20:23:44] <ddaymace_> finally supports css transitions
[20:29:30] <madprops> anybody knows a good browser based terminal?
[20:36:00] <jmmy> cache:false
[21:14:47] <jmmy> i can't believe ajax doesn't work in IE
[21:17:15] <tw2113> it does, your attempt doesn't
[21:20:52] <tw2113> jmmy, you got the site live? i'll bother to turn on my other computer that has IE and kick it a bit
[21:22:08] <jmmy> tw2113, amzumortgages.ca/Contact_Mortgage_Hamilton_Burlington.html
[21:23:21] <jmmy> http://blog.justprofessionals.com/web-design/jquery-json-internet-explorer/
[21:23:30] <jmmy> I gonna try to add the timestamp now
[21:23:51] <bleakabasement> just curious... what irc client do you guys use?
[21:24:21] <tw2113> xchat-aqua
[21:25:03] <tw2113> jmmy, the ajax is in the form submission?
[21:27:12] <jmmy> tw2113, yes, it shouldn't be?
[21:27:37] <tw2113> it can be in a lot of places
[21:27:44] <tw2113> i was just making sure i interacted with the right part of the page
[21:29:30] <tw2113> "Object doesn't support property or method 'preventDefault'"
[21:29:45] <jmmy> when you use .serialize(), what kind of dataType would you call it? json?
[21:30:07] <tw2113> try passing event into the submit function callback
[21:30:15] <tw2113> .submit(function(event){
[21:31:00] <tw2113> tell me when to refresh
[21:31:06] <jmmy> tw2113, ok 1 min
[21:31:22] <jmmy> tw2113, refresh
[21:31:41] <jmmy> I made a couple other changes too, like the timestamped url
[21:34:01] <tw2113> still not showing up in the .submit spot
[21:34:48] <tw2113> there it goes
[21:35:43] <tw2113> giving me complaints about the phone number
[21:35:48] <tw2113> despite matching the pattern
[21:37:02] <tw2113> apparently adding my own dashes makes it cough at me
[21:37:12] <tw2113> i just got it to say "Thanks, well get back to you asap"
[21:37:19] <tw2113> IE10
[21:37:26] <jmmy> tw2113, maybe I should take the dashes out of the hint then eh, lol
[21:37:59] <jmmy> so it works on ie10 then, but not ie9, and on ie8 the form submits but the ajax is broken, the page refreshes
[21:38:33] <tw2113> put IE10 into IE9 mode
[21:38:37] <tw2113> got the same success message
[21:38:50] <tw2113> no idea who that goes to, but they'll see at least two "wtf" messages from me
[21:39:14] <tw2113> no page refresh, the fields stay filled in
[21:39:28] <tw2113> make "well" in the success message read "we'll"
[21:39:59] <tw2113> i wonder if the preventDefault() issue was the primary blocker
[21:41:15] <jmmy> I can get rid of it and try again
[21:41:51] <jmmy> I can't get it to work in either ie8 or 9 now, before it was working in ie8 but not 9 but now both, can't remember the config difference
[21:41:58] <jmmy> There must be a fix for this already
[21:42:25] <tw2113> i bet it's your code more than ajax in IE
[21:42:46] <tw2113> no offense
[21:44:09] <jmmy> like what though
[21:44:50] <tw2113> dunno
[22:07:47] <jmmy> I can't get my site to  update, I uploaded a different version of a js file, but ie is still using an old version, and I restarted, deleted the history and stuff, but still...
[22:15:08] <Moult> hey all, im a bit spoilt by choice for all the lightbox scripts out there. can someone reccommend me one for showing a video?
[22:30:25] <jmmy> How the heck do you clear the cache of IE, I uploaded a new js script, but IE keeps the old one
[22:31:21] <jmmy> I clear the cache, reload the page, and its still the orig js file being loaded
[22:33:41] <runvnc> what version of ie
[22:33:58] <runvnc> you can cache bust with a query string
[22:34:01] <runvnc> fuck ie by the way
[22:34:04] <runvnc> in the goat ass
[22:34:17] <nsanden> that reminds me of adam sandler
[22:34:25] <nsanden> been a while since i heard that
[22:34:28] <runvnc> src="my.js?newversionyoubastardiev7"
[22:34:36] <runvnc> lol
[22:34:49] <runvnc> src="my.js?newversionyoubastardiev8"
[22:34:51] <runvnc> src="my.js?newversionyoubastardiev9"
[22:35:04] <napster> Is it possible to fill the textarea in the available space? [Jqmobile]
[22:36:05] <runvnc> damn I'm old
[22:40:14] <jmmy> runvnc, both ie8 &
[22:40:37] <jmmy> runvnc, both ie8 & 9, no matter if I restart or delete cache, the old js file is still there
[22:43:55] <runvnc> did you try it in chrome or firefox
[22:44:09] <runvnc> because if its still still there then you are confused about your server paths or something
[22:44:11] <runvnc> but otherwise
[22:44:13] <runvnc> cache bust
[22:44:16] <runvnc> what is the server written in
[22:44:28] <runvnc> do you have an .htaccess or something?
[22:44:35] <runvnc> maybe you can use a nocache or something in the head
[22:45:31] <runvnc> google for cache busting javascript
[22:53:36] <jmmy> runvnc, it works in other browsers
[22:54:39] <jmmy> but this cache thing is also a non-programming issue.  I mean in ie8 & 9, I can't flush out the saved cache so when I reload a website, its all fresh copies
[22:55:25] <wilkinsmc> i'm putting a disclaimer on my site that says, "do NOT use menu if you have epilepsy"
[22:55:41] <jmmy> I getting an error about event.preventDefault() so i commented it out an uploaded it, but still its loading the old version
[22:56:04] <runvnc> put the js in a separate file
[22:56:16] <runvnc> <script src="my.js?version=2"></script>
[22:56:20] <runvnc> then change my.js
[22:56:31] <runvnc> then <script src="my.js?version=3"></script>
[22:57:52] <jmmy> ok
[22:58:03] <jmmy> runvnc, I'll try that, 1 min
[23:00:10] <MickRip> jmmy: if you have php, then you could put ?$timestamp_of_js_file ... (although a bit of overhead)
[23:01:33] <jmmy> MickRip, thx
[23:01:37] <jmmy> runvnc, thx
[23:02:14] <runvnc> np
[23:02:23] <jmmy> Getting rid of event.preventDefault fixed it so the form submits and the server script runs, but the page refreshes and the ajax doesn't happen, like the commands I have after success
[23:08:09] <napster> Is it possible to theme each item in the list differently in JQMobile?
[23:24:46] <wilkinsmc> never heard of jqmobile
[23:24:54] <wilkinsmc> wonder if it will automatically convert my page to mobile :D
[23:25:04] <wilkinsmc> i don't think i'm going to make a mobile page for a bit
[23:25:07] <wilkinsmc> pain in the ass enough
[23:32:32] <raj> do you guys usually try and use <forms> ?
[23:32:39] <raj> or just use a regular old div?
[23:34:16] <jmmy> wilkinsmc, bootsrap is easy, or any template
[23:35:21] <jmmy> raj, they say it best practice to put post get data in a form
[23:35:40] <jmmy> otherwise unpredictable
[23:36:11] <jmmy> but I've done it, works on ff chrome
[23:39:45] <sacho> "they"?
[23:40:13] <jmmy> experts? manuals?
[23:40:22] <sacho> Like?
[23:40:34] <sacho> raj, if what you want is the functionality a form provides, it's just easier to use a form rather than having to emulate it via javascript.
[23:40:50] <raj> problem is I have to preventDefault
[23:41:21] <sacho> raj, I don't see the connection.
[23:41:29] <raj> and I can't seem to figure out why preventDefault isn't working for a particualr button of mine (added into the DOM at some point during interaction)
[23:41:36] <raj> nm, I have to play around with it more
[23:41:51] <sacho> It sounds like providing a test case and asking a question about it would be a good course of action.
[23:42:29] <jmmy> raj, i had remove preventDefault, for ie 8&9, I an remove the form too
[23:42:56] <raj> is there a better way to do `var check = ('somestring'.indexOf('abc') > -1) ? true : false`
[23:46:23] <sacho> you don't need the ternary there.
[23:46:43] <sacho> comparison already produces true/false.
[23:47:07] <raj> so an assert statement or something?
[23:48:01] <sacho> what?
[23:48:25] <raj> or just 'var check = 'somestring'.indexOf('abc') > -1
[23:48:28] <raj> ?
[23:48:41] <jmmy> sacho, you can omit the brackets too?
[23:48:57] <sacho> yes
[23:56:26] <raj> is there any solution to this problem http://stackoverflow.com/a/7620906/997624 ?
