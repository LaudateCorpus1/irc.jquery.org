[02:57:19] <Roger_> Hello, i have a element "foo" and i cached. I also need to access element p which is a dynamic child element of foo
[02:57:30] <Roger_> any idea how to reuse foo ?
[08:17:13] <fiord> hey all
[15:20:12] <randymarsh9> hey guys, i'm trying to target a specific option from my select dropdown but can't seem to figure out the syntax
[15:20:24] <randymarsh9> essentially i'm trying to do this:
[15:20:26] <randymarsh9> $('#my-dropdown option:5').attr('disabled','disabled')
[15:20:48] <randymarsh9> any idea?
[15:23:34] <pachet> randymarsh9: you're probably looking for the :eq() selector
[15:25:56] <jenniferjo> Hi, I need to write a script that updates something after an included script dynamically adds content. This happens on page load, and when using their own ajax pagination. Is there some way I can detect if their script has some events I can hook into, or some easy way to detect the changes? :)
[15:26:21] <jenniferjo> It's the comment section on https://www.comfyballs.no/butikk/herre/cotton/comfyballs-all-red/
[15:27:40] <randymarsh9> pachet: actually i just got it working with this syntax:
[15:27:43] <randymarsh9> $('#my-dropdown option[value="5"]').attr('disabled','disabled')
[15:27:58] <randymarsh9> pachet: what's different about using :eq?
[15:28:02] <pachet> well, that assumes a certain value
[15:28:14] <pachet> what if the value of the fifth <option> was something other than 5?
[15:28:27] <pachet> i mean, if that works for your use case, well and good
[15:28:47] <randymarsh9> it does, but now i'm curious
[15:28:55] <randymarsh9> do people make dropdown's without specifying values?
[15:29:14] <pachet> well, no, but they might have values set dynamically
[15:29:33] <randymarsh9> oh yea that's true
[15:29:47] <randymarsh9> my dropdown values happen to be in numeric order that's all lol
[15:30:06] <randymarsh9> if the values actually had a different meaning though i would use eq though right?
[15:31:21] <pachet> ostensibly, yes
[15:32:17] <randymarsh9> i think eq is what i want then, in case i want to assign different values to the value option
[15:32:20] <randymarsh9> seems more useful
[15:33:30] <randymarsh9> so it would be "option:eq(5)" ?
[15:33:44] <randymarsh9> err eq(4) in this case because it's zero based?
[15:34:11] <randymarsh9> pachet: do i have that right?
[15:35:18] <pachet> randymarsh9: looks correct to me, but run it and confirm :]
[15:35:31] <randymarsh9> pachet: yea just ran and it works
[15:35:39] <pachet> jenniferjo: you could maybe use a mutation observer
[15:35:42] <randymarsh9> much better than doing by value, thank you!!
[15:36:45] <pachet> jenniferjo: with all of the requisite warnings about browser compatibility (ie, ie<11)
[15:37:43] <jenniferjo> I don't really need to get the dom elements, since I'll just be running the same jquery script to update the data
[16:57:41] <JordiGH> Sorry for the big dump of code. I'm not sure what parts are relevant. I'm trying to figure out why schema_button on line 46 always seems to be the last button added, selected on line 31. The jquery .one() event does get bound correctly to each button in turn. http://paste.debian.net/985459/
[16:58:07] <JordiGH> The similar code for the table_button seems to work correctly. There must be something about scoping I'm not understanding.
[16:59:19] <JordiGH> The row variable also seems to be correctly bound to the current row being clicked.
