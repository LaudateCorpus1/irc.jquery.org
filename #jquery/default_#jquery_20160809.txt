[01:28:19] <mercanet> hi
[01:28:45] <mercanet> someone who can help me with jquery?
[01:29:34] <konrados> Morning :)
[01:29:57] <konrados> What's the question mercanet ?
[01:31:35] <mercanet> I have a drop-down list and want to Jquery select an item from the list and change. Change just like a click.
[01:32:29] <konrados> val() ?
[01:32:42] <mercanet> no
[01:32:57] <konrados> I'm not quite sure what you want :(
[01:33:01] <mercanet> the site is: https://www.binary.com/en/trading.html?currency=USD&market=forex&underlying=frxAUDJPY&formname=risefall&date_start=now&duration_amount=1&duration_units=m&amount=10&amount_type=payout&expiry_type=duration
[01:33:20] <mercanet> I try this
[01:33:21] <mercanet> $('#amount_type :nth(0)').prop("selected","selected"); $('div#contract_form_content_wrapper').trigger('chosen:updated'); $('div#contract_form_content_wrapper')..html('refresh',true);
[01:33:35] <mercanet> this..
[01:33:37] <mercanet> $('#amount_type :nth(0)').prop("selected","selected");
[01:33:45] <mercanet> $('div#contract_form_content_wrapper').trigger('chosen:updated');
[01:34:04] <mercanet> $('div#contract_form_content_wrapper').change();
[01:34:21] <mercanet> but it does not work
[01:35:49] <mercanet> changes the item but the page does not change. When I click the page gets change. When I use jQuery page you do not get the change.
[01:37:05] <konrados> Why not refresh the page manually, i.e. location.reload();
[01:40:02] <mercanet> ok, thanks
[02:44:56] <alturic> Hey guys, if I have a <p class="temporary">Test</p> and that's nested inside divs and such is there ANYTHING that would cause  $("p.temporary").click(function() { $(this).addClass("active"); }  to not fire?
[02:46:02] <Cork> alturic: if the element was added after the handler was bound
[02:46:27] <alturic> aha
[02:46:36] <Cork> alturic: use delegation
[02:46:55] <Cork> alturic: $('static-parent').on('click', '.temporary', function() {})
[02:49:13] <alturic> I guess that doesn't work if most of the divs and such this is wrapped in are all added after the handler?
[02:49:40] <Cork> alturic: it does, you just have to go further up until the parent IS static
[02:49:46] <alturic> In other words, I'm trying to do some things with Google Maps, hence I only have one "static" element.
[02:50:10] <alturic> And that static element is empty until the map is init
[02:50:11] <Cork> hmm, maps at least used to be in an iframe
[02:50:42] <alturic> Nah, you use <div class="map_canvas"></div> and then after init it just dumps everything into it.
[02:50:54] <Cork> as long as the event bubbles correctly it works as long as the elements are in the same dom
[02:51:14] <Cork> return false; in an event handler breaks that though (for example)
[04:25:13] <GFruleux> Hello everyone !
[04:37:08] <Blinky_> Hi all, trying to remove the last character from a string and check its value so as to apply a colour change.  The problem is I can not get the last character to remove, any ideas what I am doing wrong? - https://jsfiddle.net/a2of4znm/
[04:38:00] <slax0r> are you sure that's the right fiddle?
[04:39:32] <Cork> ya, that isn't related to string modification at all
[04:41:49] <Blinky_> Sorry try this one - https://jsfiddle.net/a2of4znm/1/
[04:41:58] <Blinky_> Must not have updated it
[04:42:50] <Blinky_> From what I have read the slice with the -1 will remove the last char, is that correct?
[04:43:38] <Cork> Blinky_: the value will still be a number on line 4
[04:43:41] <Cork> you need to parse it
[04:43:46] <Cork> also "value" isn't defined
[04:44:58] <slax0r> you are aware that your .each() handler is not firing?
[04:45:21] <slax0r> the problem is not with removing the last char, that works...
[04:46:03] <Cork> Blinky_: https://jsfiddle.net/a2of4znm/3/
[04:46:20] <Cork> the reason each isn't firing is cause the tr isn't valid without a table
[04:46:23] <Blinky_> slax0r: nope, not so good at this yet, still learning, thinking not that fast though
[04:46:48] <slax0r> oh, missed the missing table part
[04:47:22] <Cork> also defined value and parsed the value
[04:48:45] <Blinky_> ah cheers, didnt think about changing to an int, cheers for the help guys
[04:49:04] <Cork> Blinky_: not int, number
[04:49:09] <Cork> javascript isn't typed
[04:50:18] <Blinky_> Cork: sorry that has confused me a little, could you explain?
[04:50:27] <Cork> that said, you can simplify it to https://jsfiddle.net/a2of4znm/4/
[04:50:32] <Cork> Blinky_: there are no int in javascript
[04:50:52] <Cork> int means it can only be integer values
[04:51:17] <Cork> and javascript doesn't have that concept
[04:51:30] <Cork> its string, objects, numbers and arrays
[04:51:43] <Cork> not floats, doubles ints longs...
[04:51:46] <Blinky_> Cork: is see, with that last fiddle you are not removing the % sign, does the parseInt disregard the % sign when comparing?
[04:51:57] <Cork> ya
[04:52:02] <Blinky_> ah
[04:52:09] <Cork> it only parses the [0-9] values at the start of the string
[04:52:39] <Cork> if the string begins with a non number you get NaN from it
[04:52:48] <Blinky_> and the 10 at the end is for decimal numbers?
[04:53:31] <lowbro> it can parse octal and hexadecimal implicitly or explicitly, so pay attention
[04:53:47] <Cork> Blinky_: its the base
[04:54:23] <Cork> Blinky_: so parseInt('10a', 16) == 266
[04:54:23] <Blinky_> Cork: cheers, thanks a lot, learnt something new today.
[04:54:28] <Cork> Blinky_: so parseInt('10a', 10) == 10
[04:54:29] <Blinky_> lowbro: cheers also
[04:55:01] <Blinky_> but parseInt('a10', 10) = NaN ?
[04:55:02] <Cork> Blinky_: also note ALWAYS set the base
[04:55:06] <Cork> Blinky_: yes
[04:56:23] <Blinky_> One last question, when using parseFloat is there a need for the base aswell?
[04:56:38] <Cork> Blinky_: also i would prob write $(this).addClass('high') instead of css()
[04:56:44] <Cork> Blinky_: no
[04:56:51] <Cork> float is always 10 base
[04:57:11] <Blinky_> Cork: what is the reason for adding a class and not using the css option?
[04:57:13] <Cork> i would quite strongly recommend keeping css out of javascript
[04:57:19] <Blinky_> ok
[04:57:23] <Cork> maintainability
[04:57:43] <Cork> it becomes MUCH easier to 2 years down the road come and change the color/rule or what not
[04:58:05] <Cork> as the css won't have creeped into 500+ places in the javascript
[04:58:16] <Blinky_> ah right, that makes sense
[04:58:39] <Cork> also make sure you use a meaningful class name, that is much more optional
[04:58:42] <Cork> but still recommended
[04:58:54] <Cork> so not "red" but "overuse" or something
[04:59:11] <Cork> so when you change it from red to a background image you don't have to go and rename the class :)
[04:59:28] <Blinky_> yeah I do that a lot to be fair, sometimes I wonder if they are a little to long but they are easier to work out what their doing.  I also comment a lot
[04:59:44] <Cork> Blinky_: that's fine
[05:17:33] <Duikb00t> IS there a way in using hover like this to add a 'mouse-out' method? https://www.pastery.net/tqzkkq/
[05:17:36] <Duikb00t> to slide it up
[05:18:54] <Duikb00t> I tried this as well: https://www.pastery.net/pdbswf/  But that keeps no focus when I am on the 'hovered' element.
[05:19:04] <helloNL> $('[name^=address_city],[name^=address_street]').on('change', function() {}); Would this be possible?
[05:19:43] <helloNL> It's possible that there are no elements in that search on page load :P
[05:26:41] <Duikb00t> I know the HTML markup SUCKS but too to bad I have to do it with that: https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2qkL5fp0/
[05:26:53] <Duikb00t> What;s the best way in jquery to keep the element shown when hovering? it?
[05:49:53] <Cork> Duikb00t: use mouseleave, it should do what you want
[06:08:30] <AdamPDotty> Why not use :hover?
[06:11:43] <Duikb00t> fixe
[06:11:44] <Duikb00t> d
[06:12:11] <Cork> hmm good point
[06:12:33] <Cork> :hover + ul should work just fine
[06:12:52] <Cork> though the animation doesn't work with css3 as it is height animation
[06:51:06] <RandomNoob> Hello guys. http://kopy.io/gFi9K . I load function when page loads. With this function I am replacing : ) : D with emojies. I have another function which is requesting another page giving back only table. I have little chat.  On page load it is replacing after 2 sec update it is not replacing. I guess why. What I need is how to change second function ? I mean adding replace which will change the response.
[06:51:12] <RandomNoob> Sorry for my bad English.
[06:52:01] <momomo> how do I give an element focus, so that when the user page down/up it will scroll that area in the browser ?
[06:52:04] <momomo> i need this on page load
[06:53:24] <RandomNoob> Ok I did it myself. But it looks weird. is this good practice http://kopy.io/PF471
[06:53:34] <momomo> eirikb, i think element.focus() in jquery worked .. i was doing it on the wrong elemetn .. not sure how in css though, that would be better
[07:03:03] <pingo> How can I modify an already bound element click handler so it stays the same, only prevent the bubbling
[07:04:33] <pingo> :>
[07:09:20] <Cork> pingo: you can't
[07:09:31] <Cork> pingo: you can add an additional handler
[07:09:55] <pingo> Ok Ill try that
[07:10:06] <Cork> $().on('click', func); $().on('click', function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[07:10:16] <Cork> pingo: that said, you should prob avoid killing events
[07:10:38] <Cork> instead update the event listener that don't want it so it ignores it (makes the code more reliable)
[07:10:39] <pingo> I don't know how else to fix it
[07:10:51] <Cork> pingo: what is the problem?
[07:10:56] <pingo> I have no control over that event listener since it gets bound in an external lbirary
[07:11:12] <Cork> ya, but why do you want to prevent it from bubbling?
[07:11:51] <pingo> It's a collapsible container. And I added a button on it's header. And I don't want a click on that button to toggle the collapse/expand mechanism
[07:12:02] <pingo> *its
[07:12:12] <Cork> ah
[07:12:35] <Cork> and the collapse container is a plugin?
[07:12:42] <pingo> Yes its from materialize css
[07:12:49] <Cork> ok, that makes sense
[07:12:57] <pingo> http://materializecss.com/collapsible.html
[07:13:09] <pingo> And I added a "more" button to the right
[07:28:05] <walidvb> hey all
[07:28:19] <walidvb> anyone got a snippet for synchronising scrolling of two divs?
[07:28:35] <walidvb> (not trying to replicate the scroll position, just want both to scroll togethe)
[07:29:03] <Cork> walidvb: $('elm1').on('scroll', function() { $('elm2').prop('scrollTop', this.scrollTop); });
[07:29:40] <Cork> it won't be exactly together as the scroll event is async
[07:29:42] <walidvb> Cork: well, that would force the scrollTop to be ==. i'm just trying to have it so that scrolling one would scroll the other as well
[07:29:43] <Cork> but it is the best you can get
[07:30:10] <Cork> walidvb: so you have to store the change amount then
[07:30:18] <Cork> the basics is that
[07:30:23] <Cork> there isn't another way
[07:30:23] <walidvb> so i suppose i'd need to store both scroll position, and delta to both, or smth
[07:30:28] <Cork> ya
[07:30:40] <walidvb> think so too. That's why i was asking for a snippet ;)
[07:30:41] <walidvb> hehe
[07:30:42] <Cork> but be careful as the events are async you can get weird results
[07:30:49] <walidvb> but i'll write it myself
[07:30:56] <walidvb> not too bothered about details
[07:31:05] <Cork> walidvb: this channel is for helping you find how, not do it for you
[07:31:18] <walidvb> hm fair enough
[07:36:38] <walidvb> thx! :)
[08:42:22] <stennowork> good day, having a node like <div>foo<span>bar</span>baz</div>, is there a way to extract all the text from div, so that the result is ["foo", "bar", "baz"] or "foobarbaz", without having to iterate over <div>'s children manually?
[08:49:01] <Diplomat> Guys does anyone know any libs for designing rooms? Like I can design the room layout and add chairs, desks etc.. some kind of drag and drop action thingy
[08:49:23] <Diplomat> but it needs to have some kind of json data associated with that room.. so i can use that data for things
[08:49:41] <dni-> sounds fun
[08:49:42] <dni-> :)
[08:50:31] <dni-> dont think there is any out there, but its quite easy to make ;) with some effort
[08:51:14] <Diplomat> Sure, I have no problem making one.. but I was just wondering maybe there's one, no need to invent the wheel again
[08:51:29] <dni-> mh
[08:51:35] <Diplomat> But I really don't know how that kind of designers are called.. not sure what to google lol
[08:51:52] <dni-> room configurator
[08:51:53] <dni-> ;D
[08:52:17] <Diplomat> lol
[08:52:47] <dni-> but that sounds really niche
[08:52:47] <dni-> ;)
[08:53:00] <Diplomat> it is :P
[08:53:35] <dni-> i dont think anyone has published one yet
[08:54:04] <dni-> i would do it with svg ;)
[08:54:26] <Diplomat> http://www.floorplanner.com
[08:54:33] <dni-> uff
[08:54:36] <dni-> its flash
[08:54:48] <Diplomat> aww
[08:55:12] <dni-> hm yeah
[08:55:12] <dni-> ^^
[08:55:32] <dni-> maybe you will find a payed solution ;)
[08:57:05] <Diplomat> Actually it would work well with SVG + it could have some kind of interactions too
[08:57:06] <Diplomat> hmm
[08:58:45] <Diplomat> http://interactjs.io/
[08:59:08] <stennowork> oh wait, .text() actually works for that, nice
[09:00:36] <Diplomat> Hmn, I think this interactjs thing would work
[09:01:00] <AwkwardCough> stennowork: I think you want something like $("div").text()
[09:01:03] <AwkwardCough> oop nvm
[09:08:54] <stennowork> hmm
[09:09:07] <stennowork> yeah .text() works but i fear i have to iterate over all of the elements anyway
[09:09:11] <stennowork> either that or i'm lazy
[09:11:21] <taplar> your going to have to use each or map, afaik
[09:11:34] <Diplomat> I wonder how much would it cost to get a script like this.. that can design layouts etc hmm
[09:12:37] <Ahiiru> good morning
[09:12:40] <Ahiiru> http://masterkitchen.com.br - I have 3 sliders on this page, but they are letting a blank space in the top and bottom of the screen if you resize the window to 1001px width
[09:12:41] <Ahiiru> how can I fix that?
[09:13:06] <Ahiiru> is there any responsive slider which supports height 100%?
[09:17:01] <taplar> not sure, but on a 1366x768 display that header takes up a crazy amount of space
[09:17:19] <taplar> almost 1/3 of the realestate
[09:17:38] <Ahiiru> taplar: that's in my queue
[10:07:46] <PCatinean> hey guys, I have on click $(this).toggleClass('selected'), and I see in firebug the classes refreshing but nothing is added or removed
[10:09:16] <shoky> if you see the class there then it's there. maybe your css is wrong/different or you're putting it on the wrong element. make jsfiddle
[10:10:15] <PCatinean> no i mean it's not being added to the dom
[10:10:22] <PCatinean> or added and very quickly remove or smth
[10:10:51] <shoky> maybe you're toggling it twice in a row, donno. can't know without seeing what you mean. jsfiddle it
[10:11:26] <PCatinean> ah yes I am
[10:23:03] <ksm101> Hello everyone ! I'm looking for a way to get a variable value set in a function in the callback function -> $('p').hover( function(){ var x = 1; },function(){ need x here });
[10:23:21] <taplar> scope it outside of the hover
[10:23:24] <ksm101> All I managed to do is using localstorage, any better way ?
[10:23:33] <taplar> or attach it to the 'p' element
[10:25:11] <taplar> i'd probably attach it myself
[10:25:16] <ksm101> I'll make a jsfiddle cause complete function is a bit more complicated, thanks for your reply.
[10:33:06] <ksm101> Sorry, here is the jsfiddle : basically, I'd like to store the original background color of an element, and set it back to this original color in the callback function  (  https://jsfiddle.net/d20rgnaL/2/ )
[10:34:36] <taplar> right, so save it on the element as a data element
[10:35:35] <ksm101> via js in the first function, you mean ?
[10:35:39] <taplar> yep
[10:36:06] <ksm101> right, I didn't think about this one, will be cleaner than localstorage, thanks ! :)
[10:55:02] <Diplomat> Guys can anyone tell me an estimate how much I should offer to a freelancer for a project like this: https://roomstyler.com/3dplanner but a bit more simple.. not sure how big my budget should be.
[10:57:27] <taplar> Diplomat: you might have more luck in #freelance
[10:57:43] <Diplomat> ah ok , ill check there thanks
[11:07:41] <pingo> http://codepen.io/pingec/pen/RRqBmm?editors=1010 I have no clue why this materialize css would be capturing events on the button dropdown and toggling the collapsible. Any ideas how to fix it with jquery :)?
[11:22:18] <pingo> this is so weird, why the hell would they bind like that
[11:31:05] <z1haze_work> anyone use the youtube api? how does youtube determine which thumbnails are available - like default.jpg, maxres.jpg etc im running into issues where sometimes there is no maxresdefault.jpg available
[11:59:56] <killer> hey , how can i use a delete button something like this using jquery mobile
[12:46:33] <z1haze_work> is there a way to wait for images to be loaded before executing some code?
[12:46:59] <taplar> which images?  all images?
[12:47:07] <z1haze_work> I am opening a dialog with images in it, and it has a jscrollpane window so i think im having an issue where the scroll is happening before the images are loaded causing some issues - not sure though
[12:47:18] <z1haze_work> so images within a container
[12:53:56] <hellyeah> taplar:  hey
[12:54:07] <taplar> yo
[12:54:32] <z1haze_work> so is what im wanting to do possible?
[12:54:36] <hellyeah> taplar:  i try this datepicker with jquery ui datepicker. It seems bootstrap datepicker disabled all feature of jquery ui datepicker
[12:55:15] <taplar> you wouldn't use them both together
[12:55:28] <taplar> z1haze1: probably, but it will take some tinkering
[12:55:55] <z1haze_work> gotcha
[12:56:04] <hellyeah> hmm i wish i could use both :D
[12:56:28] <hellyeah> i spent my 3 months for making this I dont want to build it again :D
[12:57:01] <taplar> i thought the bootstrap one did all the stuff you had made?  what is there to build again?
[12:57:03] <hellyeah> thanks anyway
[12:58:19] <hellyeah> disabled dates, Turkish calendar, passing to next month when choose date from another month in "to"
[12:58:22] <hellyeah> etc.
[12:59:03] <hellyeah> when you remove spesific date of range date you select enable again
[13:00:19] <taplar> ah, well the turkish calendar part should just be the locale setting.  the other stuff, sure, you'd have to see if that functionality is still available
[13:00:23] <taplar> or how it would be called differently
[13:04:36] <hellyeah> taplar:  i dont think there is equal functionality you know jquery ui datepicker really fit my needs
[13:04:58] <hellyeah> taplar:  i wish the implement this thing like this in jquery datepicker instead of dropdown
[13:05:02] <taplar> except for the two parts your made, :P
[13:05:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  but i asked on the forum i guess this dropdown thing is better for ppl who has some problems in eyes
[13:05:35] <hellyeah> two parts?
[13:05:54] <taplar> the month and year popouts
[13:07:38] <hellyeah> ah
[13:07:43] <hellyeah> ah yeah
[13:07:58] <hellyeah> ş have to combine this functionality with my datepicker code
[13:08:15] <hellyeah> i have to work on it still dont know why it doesnt work
[13:08:28] <hellyeah> i will figure it out for sure
[13:08:43] <hellyeah> i have a github page btw
[13:08:51] <hellyeah> i will publish my code there
[13:11:43] <hellyeah> taplar:  do you know jqlite?
[13:12:15] <taplar> heard of it.  don't know it very well
[13:13:09] <Captain_Ramius> Hey guys.
[13:13:40] <taplar> yo
[13:13:47] <Captain_Ramius> Can someone explain when a JS framework should be used?
[13:14:17] <Captain_Ramius> We are starting a new SaaS and, thankfully, someone is doing all the grunt work.
[13:14:24] <taplar> various reasons
[13:14:58] <taplar> a JS framework can reduce your development time since it does a lot of the boiler plating for you
[13:15:14] <taplar> also it can help encourage team coding practices if your playing by the frameworks standards
[13:16:06] <taplar> so it's a question of the size of the project, the size of the team, and such things
[13:16:25] <Captain_Ramius> Our head developer is strong in Java but "can handle JS". I was wondering a JS framework would make it easier for him to get through the JS part?
[13:16:49] <Captain_Ramius> FYI, we don't need the "latest and greatest" flashy, fancy JS.
[13:16:56] <taplar> lets put it this way
[13:17:04] <taplar> a black box can help you do things faster.
[13:17:11] <taplar> but when things break, what are you going to do?
[13:17:19] <Captain_Ramius> Sorry, what's a "black box"?
[13:17:32] <taplar> something that does something for you, but you don't know how
[13:17:40] <Captain_Ramius> haha, ok
[13:17:52] <taplar> it's hard to support something if you don't know what it does
[13:18:08] <taplar> that's not saying that you shouldn't use a framework, but you should make an attempt at some level of understanding of it
[13:18:26] <Captain_Ramius> Oh, so power tools make carpentry  easier but only if you know how to use them and not cut your hand off
[13:18:31] <hellyeah> Captain_Ramius:  angular or react?
[13:18:41] <Captain_Ramius> hellyeah, *shrug* it's all greek to me
[13:18:45] <taplar> eh, kinda.
[13:18:50] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:18:51] <Captain_Ramius> I just started PHP a few months ago.
[13:19:02] <Captain_Ramius> I'm in webdev Kindergarten.
[13:19:17] <hellyeah> is it SPA?
[13:19:37] <hellyeah> single page application
[13:19:45] <taplar> i would suggest finding some online courses in JS and/or some books on the matter.  knowing something about the domain is important.
[13:19:55] <Captain_Ramius> I don't think it will be. There's no need for that and page-by-page nav will be easier for the typical user.
[13:20:10] <Captain_Ramius> *they will want to bookmark various pages
[13:20:25] <hellyeah> codeschool has good JS courses
[13:20:29] <edoc> what language  Google uses  to code doodles?
[13:21:55] <hellyeah> Captain_Ramius:  #javascript is better to ask thos question btw
[13:22:36] <Captain_Ramius> I figured that but they didn't reply, so here I am.
[13:23:40] <Captain_Ramius> I don't think a framework will give us a boost in this case. We don't need much fancy JS and we're not familiar with the intricacies of the frameworks anyway
[13:24:06] <Captain_Ramius> Thanks, that resolves that issue.
[13:24:10] <Tokynet> hello
[13:24:21] <taplar> aloha
[13:24:38] <alluringme> O.o Alohaaa! XD
[13:24:40] <Tokynet> im trying to parse the output of aws cli output to retrieve 2 fields, privateip and keyname
[13:24:51] <Tokynet> mahalo
[13:25:41] <Tokynet> i have the (long) command string but its giving me the output of privateip in one run, and the output of keyname in another run
[13:26:10] <Tokynet> I would like to have the output be "privateip" "keyname"  (one line)
[13:26:31] <Tokynet>  aws ec2 describe-instances --output=json | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[].PrivateIpAddress, .Reservations[].Instances[].KeyName'
[13:26:37] <Tokynet> that is the command im using
[13:26:38] * alluringme I feel funny today!! Where are the other rascal programmers?? Ewww, I mean Pascal programmers?:P
[13:28:15] <taplar> idk anything about aws, :/
[13:28:38] <Tokynet> well, i thought it was a jquery issue
[13:28:50] <Tokynet> as in the way my command is written
[13:29:44] <Tokynet> the describe-instances spits out lots of json about each server i have in AWS, i just want to get those 2 values from the json blob
[13:30:18] <taplar> what does the response actually look like?
[13:30:31] <Tokynet> putting it up on pastebin
[13:32:27] <hellyeah> is this jquery?
[13:34:23] <Tokynet> http://pastebin.com/6BVfQEhC
[13:34:41] <Tokynet> hellyeah: yes, im trying to use jquery to parse it
[13:35:21] <Tokynet> that paste bin is the response of 1 server, the actual reponse i get is about 200 of those
[13:38:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/gdxzhu4b/ are you parsing it with JSON.parse ?
[13:39:09] <Tokynet> nope, im just piping the output (json) from aws cli straight to jq
[13:39:09] <hellyeah> taplar:  isnt that htmlParse() ?
[13:39:18] <Tokynet>  aws ec2 describe-instances --output=json | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[].PrivateIpAddress, .Reservations[].Instances[].KeyName'
[13:39:21] <taplar> hmm?
[13:39:45] <shoky> jq is not jquery
[13:39:47] <shoky> :)
[13:39:53] <taplar> ahhhhhhhh
[13:40:03] <Tokynet> .....my bad
[13:40:09] <taplar> yay, someone who has an idea, lol
[13:40:12] * taplar retreats
[13:40:16] <shoky> ;p
[13:40:35] <Tokynet> thought it was short for it... sorry then.
[13:40:49] <Tokynet> let me see if there is a jq channel then
[13:40:56] <hellyeah> jq
[13:41:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:41:10] <Tokynet> would you look at that....
[13:41:14] <hellyeah> ./list
[13:41:27] <hellyeah> you can search achannel with spesific keyword too
[13:41:30] <Tokynet> well i will walk away like nothing happened...
[13:41:32] <hellyeah> i dont remember the command
[13:41:43] <hellyeah> just transpessing
[13:41:45] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[13:41:45] <hellyeah> :D
[13:41:46] <Tokynet> thanks for not bitting my head off
[13:42:00] <taplar> i was trying!
[13:42:03] * shoky burps
[13:42:04] <taplar> not the head bite part
[13:42:17] <hellyeah> taplar:  you are nice and polite
[13:42:28] <taplar> lies!
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> taplar is the biggest jerk
[13:42:41] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:42:49] <taplar> i have to be the biggest something
[13:43:03] <hellyeah> you cannot be niggest loser :D
[13:43:04] <taplar> i'm american!
[13:43:07] <hellyeah> biggest*
[13:43:12] <taplar> woah
[13:43:14] <hellyeah> biggest american
[13:43:16] <hellyeah> ?
[13:43:28] <hellyeah> TRUMP may be bigget than you :D
[13:43:32] <taplar> i know, redundant
[13:43:46] <shoky> funny typos
[13:43:46] <hellyeah> Clinton take the lead anyway
[13:43:55] * taplar is enjoying hellyeah's typos today
[13:44:01] <hellyeah> shoky:  you mean niggest
[13:44:02] <hellyeah> hahaha
[13:44:06] <shoky> and bigget :D
[13:44:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:44:12] <hellyeah> that laugh me
[13:44:16] <shoky> LOL.
[13:44:20] <hellyeah> i am sorry taplar i didnt mean that
[13:44:21] <shoky> sry
[13:44:32] <hellyeah> just typo my hands are big
[13:44:41] <shoky> hellyeah you are on fire today :D
[13:45:09] <shoky> might be me, ok
[13:45:17] <hellyeah> well i shorten my way from job to home like two hours
[13:45:20] <hellyeah> i can sleep
[13:45:30] <taplar> :o
[13:45:31] <hellyeah> i am not so tired
[13:45:53] <taplar> how'd you do that?
[13:45:57] <taplar> that's like, not a small increase
[13:46:04] <hellyeah> move to another apetment
[13:46:04] <taplar> decrease even
[13:46:15] <hellyeah> from one side of city to another
[13:46:31] <taplar> nice
[13:47:18] <hellyeah> i wanna learn smt new :D
[13:47:43] <hellyeah> actually i can fix smt my draggable,droppable, sortable things
[13:57:56] <WorldsEndless> I'm trying to generate a "#menu div span" where the div and span dont' exist yet. I have an append chain, but each successive append seems to append to the menu, rather than appending to the thing before it (the span isn't goign inside the div as I wish). What do I have wrong?
[13:58:13] <robertmaxrees> WorldsEndless literally no way for us to know without seeing your code :)
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> try making a jsfiddle.
[13:58:49] <WorldsEndless> https://jsfiddle.net/ehkryd42/
[13:59:23] <WorldsEndless> Obviously, I haven't done a lot of jquery
[14:00:00] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:00:12] <robertmaxrees> .append("<div id='odh-search'>") appends the opening AND closing tags.
[14:00:13] <WorldsEndless> Append probably isnt' the right thing
[14:00:39] <WorldsEndless> So what would I need to do to get the span inside the div?
[14:00:45] <robertmaxrees> beacuse of how jquery works, you want https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ehkryd42/2/
[14:01:12] <WorldsEndless> ok. Not very semantically pleasing, but if it works...
[14:01:49] <taplar> otherwise you'd want to break up the appends
[14:01:51] <robertmaxrees> i would look into using a tempalting engine.
[14:02:00] <WorldsEndless> That's what I've used previously; now I'm in Wordpress
[14:02:15] <WorldsEndless> I was pretty spoiled by Clojurescript on more preferable projects :)
[14:02:25] <robertmaxrees> *templating.  and you could still bring in a client-side engine.
[14:03:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ehkryd42/3/
[14:03:09] <robertmaxrees> this should actually give you what you need.
[14:03:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:03:25] <robertmaxrees> just needed to omit the </div> from that last append.
[14:03:53] <WorldsEndless> Oh. Ok. That's a bit weird -- no closing div, but a closing span
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the closing span either.
[14:04:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery autocloses those for you.
[14:04:17] <taplar> they should all be the same level?
[14:04:21] <robertmaxrees> $('<div>') creates <div></div>
[14:04:36] <robertmaxrees> oh good point taplar
[14:04:40] <WorldsEndless> The "search" text is actually not in the empty span, should be a sister. But the Div is their parent
[14:04:44] <taplar> right, but its still appending to the parent
[14:04:48] <taplar> you'd have to find after appending
[14:04:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah ^ my bad.
[14:05:39] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ehkryd42/4/
[14:05:39] <taplar> ugly though
[14:06:09] <WorldsEndless> Yeah, I think I'm goign with just the single append and the big string
[14:06:28] <robertmaxrees> the other approach is to declare vars and separate things out a big more.
[14:06:53] <WorldsEndless> robertmaxrees: In such a case you must use glue other than .append, right?
[14:07:28] <WorldsEndless> (parent > parent > two siblings) seems a little tricky
[14:07:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ehkryd42/6/
[14:07:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd do something like this.
[14:07:59] <WorldsEndless> Yeah, yeah. that's much more pleasing
[14:08:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ehkryd42/7/
[14:08:19] <robertmaxrees> plus it maintains the hierarchy you want.
[14:08:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd still just bring in a simple templating engine since jquery is pretty poor at doing stuff like this, but that's just me.
[14:09:18] <taplar> was it asked why that structure doesn't already exist in the markup?
[14:09:28] <WorldsEndless> What templating engines do you prefer?
[14:09:45] <robertmaxrees> depends on the project. if i just want something simple, underscore includes one that's pretty alright.
[14:09:47] <WorldsEndless> taplar: Dancing around Wordpress templating
[14:10:03] <robertmaxrees> WorldsEndless why not inject that server-side and then hide/show it?
[14:19:56] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[14:23:36] <taplar> lol
[14:23:48] <taplar> i just imagined you sitting in a library one day
[14:24:51] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:34:31] <taplar> i got bloodhound gang stuck in my head today for some reason
[14:34:40] <robertmaxrees> that's awesome/terrible
[14:36:21] <robertmaxrees> i've been listening to a lot of eddie floyd and otis redding and stuff like that.
[14:36:51] <hellyeah> eddie floyd?

[14:37:29] <robertmaxrees> classic soul/R&B
[14:40:50] <WorldsEndless> robertmaxrees: Going this way because it is following a wordpress menu that's hard to get inside and will be dynamically sized, so DOM manipulation in JS seemed easier (since it will be JS anyway with a fly-out search menu)
[14:41:15] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't use CSS in that case?
[14:42:40] <WorldsEndless> robertmaxrees: The Wordpress template flow doesn't directly expose a place to insert or echo raw HTML, so it would have seemed hackish to me. JS allows me some encapsulation; and the fact is, the less I can wrestle with Wordpress system, the happier I am
[14:43:13] <robertmaxrees> i generally recommend that you avoid doing as much as possible in JS, but fair enough :)
[14:44:06] <WorldsEndless> Oh, I've been working Node, Reagent, Clojurescript, so I tend to be a little heavier on the JS :)
[14:44:14] <WorldsEndless> Sorry, Reagent = React
[14:44:23] <robertmaxrees> that's fair, but suggestion would still be the same :)
[14:45:52] <WorldsEndless> I have a deep-seated dislike for PHP; I avoid the taste whenever I can
[14:46:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:46:21] <robertmaxrees> i work in coldfusion.
[14:46:25] <robertmaxrees> so i know the feeling.
[14:46:56] <hellyeah> laravel is good option too
[14:47:06] <robertmaxrees> lol laravel is still php.
[14:47:22] <hellyeah> dunno you may like that
[14:47:28] <hellyeah> you dont like php at all i guess
[14:47:30] <WorldsEndless> Yeah, Laravel, Cake, Yii... tons of frameworks trying to duct-tape PHP into something more respectable
[14:47:45] <hellyeah> try asp.net then
[14:47:54] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's not really helpful in this case.
[14:48:02] <robertmaxrees> he's already built a bunch of the project heh
[14:48:03] <hellyeah> asp.net?
[14:48:10] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:48:30] <hellyeah> you could write backend with haskell i am sure :D
[14:48:32] <robertmaxrees> that's throwing the baby out witht he bathwater.
[14:48:33] <WorldsEndless> Well, this one is in Wordpress (like about 100 others I oversee), so i'm stuck. When I can get away, I use Clojure/Java stacks
[14:48:39] <WorldsEndless> Haskell would be tempting :)
[14:48:40] <pingo> $this.on('click.collapse', '> li > .collapsible-header', function(e) {}
[14:48:46] <pingo> What is this "click.collapse" ?
[14:48:53] <robertmaxrees> a namespaced event, pingo
[14:48:54] <pingo> the part after the dot?
[14:49:00] <robertmaxrees> pingo check out the docs for .on()
[14:49:03] <robertmaxrees> and .trigger()
[14:49:04] <hellyeah> i didnt hear event click.collapse
[14:49:16] <hellyeah> is there event like that?
[14:49:35] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah if you look at the docs for trigger and on, you'll see what namespaced events are.
[14:50:15] <pingo> ah i see
[14:50:18] <pingo> thanks
[14:52:22] <hellyeah> i like delegation btw
[14:53:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:53:53] <momomo> is there an even for when a dom node has been rendered .. simply executing js in a script after element does not seem to work ... i have a flex element that gets it width after rendering and I need to get this width too
[14:54:10] <robertmaxrees> momomo is the width getting set by javascript?
[14:54:13] <robertmaxrees> or just by CSS?
[14:55:22] <robertmaxrees> i ask because there's not really an event for that.  but there might be an alternative appraoch to your problem.
[14:55:42] <pingo> How to check if any ancestor of the element has a certain class?
[14:55:53] <robertmaxrees> .closest('.someClass').length
[14:56:09] <momomo> robertmaxrees, the width had to be set using js in the end..  was impossible to image size correct based on a couple of things .. but I guess that might be one of the problems
[14:56:26] <robertmaxrees> momomo that's your entire problem.  why not use CSS?
[14:56:41] <momomo> robertmaxrees, impossible for certain things
[14:56:52] <robertmaxrees> lol 'kay.
[14:57:00] <momomo> you don't believe me?
[14:57:03] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to manually call your logic.
[14:57:11] <b1tchcakes> does anyone know how to accomplish this in javascript? http://hastebin.com/yuvaruxiqu.vala
[14:57:15] <robertmaxrees> 90% of the time it's not impossible, but people hate hearing that :)
[14:57:53] <pingo> robertmaxrees thanks that is more performant than .parents probably
[14:58:09] <robertmaxrees> pingo yep.  it stops at the first element it finds.
[14:58:10] <momomo> robertmaxrees, then believe me when I say it's the other 10%
[14:58:15] <robertmaxrees> moei
[14:58:22] <robertmaxrees> momomo no need to get hostile yo
[14:58:25] <momomo> haha
[14:58:33] <robertmaxrees> either way, you'll need to call your logic manually.
[14:58:40] <momomo> I spent two days doing everything in my power to avoid doing it in js
[14:59:04] <momomo> there are things like video elements and img elemtns and ratios that makes inheriting parent heigght/width a hell
[14:59:09] <robertmaxrees> b1tchcakes what are you trying to accomplish here?
[14:59:32] <robertmaxrees> momomo we usually just use percentages and a decent grid system.  Haven't had any issues yet.
[15:00:08] <b1tchcakes> I am trying to create an array of classnames that I can instantiate based on a variable name
[15:02:11] <robertmaxrees> that's an interesting way to do that.
[15:03:13] <b1tchcakes> we have about 10 javascript classes that are all in different files.  like AHandler, BHandler, CHandler, etc.  all of those are javascript files.  When someone logs into an app, PHP generates a page that says which handler they want to use.  Because this can be A, B, C, I need to be able to pass a variable name into the javascript constructor like "A". "B" or "C" and the javascript responds with the correct handler.
[15:03:38] <pingo> There is an event handler bound on an element. Is there a way to wrap this handler so that I do an extra check and then decide whether to call the wrapped handler?
[15:04:01] <robertmaxrees> pingo you'd have to use an if statement around the logic.
[15:04:06] <pingo> Basically I am trying to override some behavior in a framework
[15:04:28] <pingo> robertmaxrees ?
[15:04:46] <robertmaxrees> pingo if (someCondition) { /* your logic here */ }
[15:04:58] <pingo> err
[15:05:44] <pingo> Framework X binds even 'click' on a div upon initialization. Now after initialization I want to modify that 'click' handler so that it does not always execute
[15:05:48] <pingo> *event
[15:05:54] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:06:30] <pingo> Basically I want to add an extra check before their event handler executes
[15:06:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not without some really awkward finagling.
[15:07:05] <sanjayb> hmm pingo .. wondering if you can do some weirdness of putting another element inside the div that's the same size, catching the click event on that and calling event.stopPropagation() if you don't want the event to bubble up.
[15:07:13] <sanjayb> pingo, but that seems very ugly.
[15:07:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, and it'll be really hard to understand.
[15:07:23] <sanjayb> it seems like there *should* be a better way.
[15:07:30] <robertmaxrees> what's the plugin?
[15:08:01] <pingo> materialize css
[15:08:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'd have to see a fiddle or something.
[15:08:29] <pingo> sec
[15:08:46] <pingo> http://codepen.io/pingec/pen/RRqBmm?editors=1010
[15:08:47] <robertmaxrees> i might target the particular element through that parent class and use the css pointer-events thing to stop interaction.
[15:08:51] <robertmaxrees> but iirc support for taht isn't great.
[15:09:01] <pingo> click on the right button, click on the dropdown menu
[15:09:21] <pingo> and you will notice that also toggles the collapsible header which I want to prevent
[15:10:19] <pingo> And I cannot use e.stopPropagation() because they setup an event handler on the whole document to close the dropdown
[15:10:37] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to close the dropdown in certain cases?
[15:11:22] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want to refresh the content while keeping it open.
[15:11:23] <pingo> robertmaxrees no, the problem is when you click on an option on the dropdown
[15:11:27] <pingo> It triggers the collapsible
[15:11:38] <pingo> which is wrong
[15:11:40] <robertmaxrees> right, you want it to stay open, right?
[15:11:49] <pingo> I want it to not change state
[15:11:54] <pingo> whether closed or open
[15:12:16] <pingo> When you click on the dropdown, the collapsible also registers a click on its header, which is wrong
[15:12:57] <pingo> The collapsible should only collapse/expand when you click on its header directly, not on some dropdown menu :)
[15:12:57] <momomo> is is possible to match @media not on window size, but on parent element size ?
[15:15:13] <robertmaxrees> pingo yeah without manually wiring it all up per the docs at http://materializecss.com/dropdown.html#!, i got nothin'.
[15:15:33] <robertmaxrees> momomo not really.
[15:15:54] <pingo> I will hack it!
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> looks like momomo is checking in ##javascript.  awesome :) i need lunch.  bbiab.
[15:18:52] <pingo> Can I access bound event handlers?
[15:24:46] <pingo> I think I will have to make a pull request to the framework
[15:25:42] <pingo> Oh wait I know
[15:27:51] <pingo> Haha I fixed it
[15:29:59] <pingo> robertmaxrees http://codepen.io/pingec/pen/RRqBmm?editors=1010
[15:31:05] <sifat> Hi all, I have a Meteor app and I got DataTables implemented with npm.  But every time I try searching on the table, all the data disappears. Does anyone know how to implement with Meteor? My table ends up like this: http://oi63.tinypic.com/144a6uw.jpg
[15:35:25] <robertmaxrees> pingo event handlers are in a private API.
[15:35:36] <robertmaxrees> sifat you might have more luck in the datatables forums.
[15:35:53] <pingo> Well I got it to work that way
[15:35:55] <pingo> Its ugly
[15:36:02] <pingo> Clients dont care though
[15:36:12] <robertmaxrees> but you might when you get bug reports :)
[15:36:26] <pingo> I know, I will cry later
[15:36:33] <robertmaxrees> i might check the docs from matrialize - there's a propagation option when you init.
[15:36:39] <robertmaxrees> might be worth looking into.
[15:36:47] <pingo> what docs
[15:36:55] <robertmaxrees> the materialize docs that i linked earlier.
[15:37:30] <pingo> ooh
[15:37:33] <pingo> that might help
[15:37:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:37:37] <pingo> thanks I missed that
[15:37:43] <robertmaxrees> that's why i linked them and mentioned that flag.
[15:38:02] <pingo> I must have been distracted, Im sorry
[15:38:09] <robertmaxrees> It's all good :)
[15:40:02] <pingo> doesnt seem to stop anything
[15:40:11] <robertmaxrees> just something to look into
[15:40:13] <robertmaxrees> but alright :)
[15:40:14] <pingo> Will keep poking it
[15:41:19] <b1tchcakes> can anyone tell me the issue here: http://hastebin.com/refoxekula.coffee
[15:41:44] <robertmaxrees> b1tchcakes because return statements expect a constructor.
[15:41:47] <robertmaxrees> which is a function.
[15:42:06] <b1tchcakes> the first 6 lines work...
[15:42:30] <robertmaxrees> then i guess i'm unclear about what "does not work" means
[15:42:33] <robertmaxrees> are you getting an error?
[15:42:35] <b1tchcakes> it's returning the class in the first two return statements.  I want to replace those lines with that line 11
[15:42:53] <robertmaxrees>  return new window[item_handler_name;] isn't valid fwiw.
[15:42:57] <robertmaxrees>   return new window[item_handler_name] is what you might want.
[15:43:20] <b1tchcakes> yes.  that is what line 14 is and i get the same issue stating that it's not a constructor
[15:43:40] <robertmaxrees> if item_handler_name is a string,   return new item_handler_name; is trying to return a new string.  and do a console.log(window[item_handler_name]);
[15:43:42] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[15:43:56] <b1tchcakes> Uncaught TypeError: item_handler_name is not a constructor
[15:44:18] <robertmaxrees> i mean for the one where you access a property on window.
[15:44:59] <robertmaxrees> same thing, right?
[15:45:05] <b1tchcakes>  Uncaught TypeError: window[item_handler_name] is not a constructor
[15:45:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  sounds like the handler isn't global then.
[15:45:38] <robertmaxrees> errr, the class.
[15:45:44] <b1tchcakes> its sitting in a file by itself and loaded as a js file
[15:45:53] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) that's what that error means.
[15:46:17] <b1tchcakes> sorry, I think I'm lost.
[15:46:34] <robertmaxrees> the classes aren't properties on the window object.
[15:46:37] <robertmaxrees> that's what that error means.
[15:47:53] <robertmaxrees> fwiw es2015 added a whole slew of rules about that stuff.
[15:48:18] <robertmaxrees> let, const, and class at the global scope create globals that aren't properties on the global object.
[15:48:34] <b1tchcakes> so I just added window.CheckLeadSourceHandler = CheckLeadSourceHandler; into the bottom of class file and it started working.  I realize doing this is wrong, but I'm afraid I don't know enough about how to do it the right way.
[15:48:54] <robertmaxrees> given the way you've gone about all of this, that's the only way to do it.
[15:49:08] <robertmaxrees> i would've used a module loader and dynamically instantiated that way but meh.
[15:51:44] <pingo> hmmm
[15:54:12] <pingo> robertmaxrees https://bantam.pingec.si/publish/materialize-dropdown-options.png
[15:54:29] <pingo> Can options here ever be anything but undefined?
[15:54:56] <pingo> looks like a bug to me
[15:55:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:55:06] <robertmaxrees> var options = $();
[15:55:12] <robertmaxrees> something here looks really strange heh
[15:55:26] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're in a new scope there.
[15:55:35] <pingo> yes
[15:55:46] <pingo> so they are not extending anything
[15:55:51] <robertmaxrees> no idea yo.
[15:55:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to play with it.
[15:56:36] <pingo> That "var options = $.extend({}, defaults, options);" should really be "options = $.extend({}, defaults, options);"
[15:56:39] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:56:45] <robertmaxrees> let's test the idea first ;)
[15:57:39] <robertmaxrees> sorry, hard to read the fiddle.
[15:57:52] <robertmaxrees> err, screenshot.
[15:58:15] <pingo> no problem
[15:58:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if that's a bug with chrome's tools.
[15:58:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wz4nqwjo/
[15:58:34] <pingo> I wonder if thats var hoisting problem
[15:58:55] <robertmaxrees> i really doubt google screwed that up.
[15:59:30] <pingo> Lets test
[15:59:38] <robertmaxrees> i already am ;)
[15:59:42] <robertmaxrees> take a look at that fiddle.
[16:00:08] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[16:00:17] <robertmaxrees> it's a kitchy way to stomp over the variable definition.
[16:00:19] <robertmaxrees> you're fine.
[16:00:31] <robertmaxrees> take options from a string to an object.
[16:00:56] <pingo> yea its a bug in the materialize code
[16:01:08] <robertmaxrees> why do you think it's a bug?
[16:01:21] <pingo> How is it not a bug?
[16:01:28] <robertmaxrees> what behavior is that breaking?
[16:01:36] <robertmaxrees> and how would you try to fix it?
[16:01:37] <pingo> Makes no sesne
[16:01:45] <robertmaxrees> try fixing it and see what happens.
[16:01:49] <pingo> Why would you extend an object with something that is always undefined
[16:01:59] <pingo> And the code does not work correctly so...
[16:02:06] <robertmaxrees> try fixing it then.
[16:02:10] <robertmaxrees> and submit a PR ;)
[16:02:49] <pingo> https://jsfiddle.net/3nt1ny5L/
[16:02:57] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:03:02] <robertmaxrees> why are you ignoring the code i already shared?
[16:03:17] <pingo> oh
[16:03:19] <robertmaxrees> and i'll bet there's a reason they're adding a new scope.
[16:03:20] <pingo> I must be blind
[16:03:27] <robertmaxrees> but (shrug)
[16:03:29] <pingo> no
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> fix it and submit a pr.  see what happens :)
[16:04:13] <pingo> Probably a "this is already fixed in PR xyz"
[16:04:24] <robertmaxrees> check their master branch then.
[16:04:59] <pingo> yep
[16:05:04] <pingo> on github its fixed ;)
[16:05:07] <pingo> on cdn its not
[16:05:18] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  wonder why they did it that way in the first place.
[16:05:40] <pingo> bug
[16:05:44] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:05:46] <robertmaxrees> so what's the backstory.
[16:05:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:08:17] <pingo> backstory is javascript
[16:08:22] <robertmaxrees> uh, 'kay.
[16:08:47] <robertmaxrees> my point is that's a pretty big oversight.  i'd wonder why that didn't get caught earlier.
[16:08:48] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[16:54:52] <pingo>  $.extend({}, obj1, obj2); if both objects have the same property, which one takes precedence?
[16:56:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ousmxwxe/
[16:56:46] <pingo> ok found the answer
[16:56:55] <robertmaxrees> :) easy fiddles to make.
[16:59:14] <pingo> found more bugs

[19:59:47] <ashzade> Evening everyone. Does anyone have any direction on how I can use jQuery to add a dropdown to a text field?
[20:00:01] <ashzade> I saw this https://helgesverre.com/blog/textbox-dropdown-html5/ and thought I could add the datalist via jquery
[20:00:50] <robertmaxrees> you can .append() elements to it.
[20:01:35] <robertmaxrees> in fact, that link shows you the non-jquery way.  very similar concept with jquery.
[20:01:49] <ashzade> robertmaxrees: so on click, append a dropdown? Ideally the user would see a drop down. It doesn't need to autocomplete
[20:01:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:02:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get a datalist?  or do something different?
[20:02:11] <ashzade> sorry, not sure if you're talking to me
[20:02:14] <robertmaxrees> i am.
[20:02:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:02:17] <ashzade> :)
[20:02:51] <robertmaxrees> so do you want a datalist?  or something else?
[20:03:02] <ashzade> I may not be explaining it well. I have a text field. When the user clicks it, I'd like to show a drop down of options, the options coming from field values from other fields.
[20:03:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/gLz61jgp/
[20:03:19] <robertmaxrees> this shows the dropdown.
[20:04:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/gLz61jgp/1/
[20:04:07] <robertmaxrees> here's one that dynamically adds an option.
[20:05:51] <ashzade> I'm on safari on a mac. It's just an empty text field for me. Hmmm
[20:06:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you may need a plugin to handle this for you.
[20:07:02] <ashzade> Does hte jsfiddle display options when you click it for you?
[20:07:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[20:07:10] <robertmaxrees> because my browser supports it.
[20:07:14] <robertmaxrees> but not all of them do.
[20:07:37] <arc_> yeah, safari doesn't support datalist unfortunately
[20:08:33] <ashzade> Hmm yes it works exactly how I want in Chrome
[20:09:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out something like selectize personally
[20:11:38] <ashzade> oh ya that could definitely work
[20:12:50] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet there's probably a polyfill for the native functionality, too.
[20:13:12] <ashzade> Thanks so much, I have a few options now
[20:13:16] <ashzade> robertmaxrees++
[20:13:18] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[20:14:15] <ashzade> https://github.com/thgreasi/datalist-polyfill :)
[20:14:42] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
