[03:11:21] <bestdesign1> robertmaxrees: thank you i will check
[03:11:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[03:38:08] <bestdesign1> robertmaxrees: is there any way with a var still select the current :selected value also and then add text the date?
[03:38:26] <bestdesign1> so like One - Date
[03:38:47] <robertmaxrees> you mean add the date to the value??
[03:39:25] <bestdesign1> robertmaxrees: yes like http://jsfiddle.net/21yzwnk6/ but there is Object Object
[03:39:49] <robertmaxrees> well yeah - var test = $("#selectbox").val(''); sets the value to an empty string...
[03:39:57] <robertmaxrees> if you want to get the value, don't pass anything.
[03:40:22] <bestdesign1> ahh yes but how include with .text the current value then and still add date?
[03:40:34] <robertmaxrees> then grab the text??
[03:41:10] <bestdesign1> grab the value "One - 2021.03 .10" to be this after select and promt
[03:41:12] <robertmaxrees> not really clear where you're lost.
[03:41:40] <robertmaxrees> you just need to grab the text or val and then append the input.
[03:42:15] <bestdesign1> oh with .text() ?
[03:42:22] <robertmaxrees> have you tried? :)
[03:42:47] <robertmaxrees> i would highly suggest that you check out learn.jquery.com and learnthe basics.
[03:43:06] <bestdesign1> robertmaxrees: i do but something i got all value lol
[03:43:07] <bestdesign1> http://jsfiddle.net/6f78tygq/
[03:43:14] <bestdesign1> yes :x
[03:43:47] <robertmaxrees> huh??
[03:43:52] <robertmaxrees> your code is confusing.
[03:44:42] <bestdesign1> robertmaxrees: somehow works what i want see
[03:44:43] <bestdesign1> http://jsfiddle.net/6f78tygq/1/
[03:44:49] <bestdesign1> thanks for help
[03:44:55] <robertmaxrees> first up - don't use onchange or onclick
[03:44:59] <robertmaxrees> bind using jquery.,
[03:45:27] <bestdesign1> yes this just for test :)
[03:45:36] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change anything.
[03:45:43] <robertmaxrees> use jquery to bind the listener :)
[03:45:53] <bestdesign1> they key was .text not .val and etc
[03:45:58] <robertmaxrees> sure
[03:46:11] <robertmaxrees> but again - this is going to be a really bad experience for your users.
[03:46:23] <bestdesign1> with input val is fine that makes me crazy input no
[03:46:38] <bestdesign1> this just add a date to send me
[03:46:48] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good way to do what you want to do.
[03:47:01] <robertmaxrees> if you just need a date, add an input for date.
[03:47:10] <robertmaxrees> don't prompt the user for one and then modify the select.
[03:47:22] <robertmaxrees> just have an input for date.
[03:48:16] <bestdesign1> well yeah
[03:48:19] <bestdesign1> i will think
[03:48:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9w0ajok1/2/
[03:48:46] <robertmaxrees> done
[03:49:08] <robertmaxrees> include a polyfill for browsers that don't support date and you're goot do go.
[03:49:12] <robertmaxrees> *good to go
[03:49:32] <bestdesign1> hmm yes its right
[06:06:37] <bboy> Hi guys, I have this form getting the values using map but every value in a single array. I want to combine them to be like: Arr={object1[B.Sc,Communication,..],object2[B.Sc,Electrical,..]}, something like this. Please find the attached url: https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/ozvsr9ap/4/
[06:07:08] <bboy> I think it's called Array of Objects
[06:07:22] <bboy> I'm not sure how it's done. I need small help in that
[06:07:41] <bboy> I created the form but only this step is missing
[06:21:50] <Cork> bboy: why not just use $(forn).serializeArray() ?
[06:23:51] <bboy> OK. I will check it
[06:28:13] <Cork> bboy: you might find this one intressting too https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject
[06:31:19] <bboy> Yes. I think this one is better. I hope it will work with me
[06:32:36] <Cork> bboy: the later is just a wrapper around serializeArray
[06:32:41] <Cork> but a nice wrapper
[06:33:45] <bboy> I think it won't work because I will need to use a counter for serializeObject
[06:34:41] <bboy> like this $('eduField'+counter).serializeObject(); I'm not sure if it's a good way
[06:37:28] <Cork> bboy: why, the fields should be part of the form so just serialize the entire form and you should get all the fields
[07:09:44] <bboy> Cork, I'm getting it like this: https://pastebin.com/zwSSGtwq and I want it to be like this: {0,communication,eng,2013},{1,nurse,...}
[07:54:18] <bboy>  Hi guys, I have this form getting the values using map but every value in a single array. I want to combine them to be like: Arr={object1[B.Sc,Communication,..],object2[B.Sc,Electrical,..]}, something like this. Please find the attached url: https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/ozvsr9ap/4/
[07:56:14] <bboy> I tried using console.log( $( 'form' ).serializeArray() ) it's giving me the result as this: https://pastebin.com/zwSSGtwq
[07:56:54] <bboy> I need small help in how to finish this work
[07:58:05] <Uhkis> what you need is a massive rewrite of that mess
[07:58:43] <bboy> Uhkis, tell me
[08:00:14] <Uhkis> there's so many things wrong i don't really know where to start
[08:01:44] <bboy> I only need to read the form data in such this way Arr={object1[B.Sc,Communication,..],object2[B.Sc,Electrical,..]}
[08:01:54] <Uhkis> you're duplicating ids, treating single values as arrays and that append part is a huge mess
[08:03:00] <bboy> The ids it will be fixed np
[08:03:23] <bboy> But I don't know what do you mean by append part. Is there any better way
[08:09:36] <Uhkis> you can create stuff like this: fgcolsm3 = $('<div></div>', {class: 'form-group col-sm-3'}); $(container).append(fgcolsm3)
[08:13:55] <Uhkis> fix the id mess and use classes, maybe then we can get to the answer you want
[08:14:00] <bboy> https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/ozvsr9ap/19/
[08:14:38] <bboy> Uhkis, it's fixed now.
[08:14:56] <bboy> I'm sorry but I didn't understand this part fgcolsm3 = $('<div></div>', {class: 'form-group col-sm-3'});
[08:16:55] <bboy> what does this type of code called? I will google it
[10:38:34] <bboy> Hi guys, I have this form getting the values using map but every value in a single array. I want to combine them to be like: Arr={object1[B.Sc,Communication,..],object2[B.Sc,Electrical,..]}, something like this. Please find the attached url: https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/ozvsr9ap/4/
[10:38:44] <bboy> I tried using console.log( $( 'form' ).serializeArray() ) it's giving me the result as this: https://pastebin.com/zwSSGtwq
[12:30:41] <robertmaxrees> bboy what format are you trying to get?
[12:31:00] <bboy>  Arr={object1[B.Sc,Communication,..],object2[B.Sc,Electrical,..]}
[12:31:10] <bboy> Array of objects
[12:34:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:34:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid js.
[12:35:01] <robertmaxrees> can you show a valid example?
[12:36:13] <bboy> OK, let me fix the code
[12:41:50] <bboy> robertmaxrees, I was trying to submit each input by itself but this was not a good practice. I believe there is a better way to do this
[12:42:06] <bboy> using Ajax call
[12:42:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:42:23] <bboy> I hope you can help me fix this issue
[12:42:28] <robertmaxrees> you mean each input as a separate ajax call??
[12:44:07] <bboy> No, Somthing like this:[0:{B.Sc,Nursing,Medical,..,2010},1{M.ScComputer Science, Computers,...,2014}]
[12:44:28] <bboy> robertmaxtrees, something like above. I hope you got what I mean
[12:44:31] <robertmaxrees> that is not valid JS.
[12:44:45] <bboy> I meant object of Arrays
[12:44:53] <bboy> sorry Array of objects
[12:45:51] <robertmaxrees> can you show me valid js of what you want?
[12:48:51] <bboy> OK, let me show u an example: var a = [
[12:48:51] <bboy>   {
[12:48:51] <bboy>   majour0: B.Sc,
[12:48:51] <bboy>   degree0:Nursing ,...
[12:48:51] <bboy>   },
[12:48:51] <bboy>   {
[12:48:55] <bboy>   majour1: Computers,
[12:48:57] <bboy>   degree1: Computer Science
[12:48:59] <bboy> ,..  },..
[12:48:59] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code into the channel.
[12:49:01] <bboy> ];
[12:49:03] <bboy> oops, sorry
[12:49:11] <bboy> It's just a mistake
[12:49:53] <bboy> I hope you got it robertmaxrees
[12:49:58] <bboy> something like this
[12:50:41] <robertmaxrees> ??
[12:50:43] <robertmaxrees> like what??>
[12:50:48] <robertmaxrees> paste code into somewhere else.
[12:54:52] <bboy> something like this: https://pastebin.com/jhiAgkEu. This form work as repeatable form which allow the user to add fields when ever he press the plus sign and the minus sign will remove the last field
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> huh??
[12:58:59] <robertmaxrees> so confused.
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual data format you want?
[13:02:48] <robertmaxrees> do you want each property name to be the name of an input?
[13:02:50] <bboy> I updated the code once you test you can see the array of each input field if you checked the alert message popup
[13:03:18] <bboy> So, I wanted to change the format to this:  https://pastebin.com/jhiAgkEu
[13:03:28] <bboy> Array of object
[13:04:20] <robertmaxrees> do you want each property name to be the name of an input?  and the values to be the values of the inputs?
[13:04:29] <robertmaxrees> and what does each object represent??
[13:06:24] <bboy> OK, let say I want to add my information: I studied (B.Sc,Electrical Engineering, Electrical & Electronics Department,2012) this is one Array of object and the master is same but in another array of object
[13:07:10] <bboy> (M.Sc,Solar Energy, Electrical & Electronics Department,2016)
[13:07:54] <bboy> I believe the best format is this one: https://pastebin.com/jhiAgkEu
[13:08:52] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to drop the same link over and over fwiw :)
[13:09:24] <robertmaxrees> and gotcha - so you want each row of inputs to be one object within the array?
[13:10:05] <robertmaxrees> that'
[13:10:22] <robertmaxrees> *that's pretty straightforward.  didn't we do this recently already?  or something similar?
[13:11:51] <bboy> yes
[13:12:06] <bboy> I don't think that
[13:12:06] <robertmaxrees> so what's changed? :)
[13:12:16] <bboy> Sorry I don't think that
[13:12:33] <bboy> As you see in the jsfiddle
[13:13:00] <robertmaxrees> why are you using $.map() like that??
[13:13:11] <bboy> :) ok tell me
[13:13:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:13:32] <bboy> I'm struggling with this :)
[13:13:48] <robertmaxrees> clearly! lol.  have you done anything like learn.jquery.com?
[13:14:47] <bboy> I did this code. What you see is something I created. But the issue is with how to get the form in Array of object format
[13:15:12] <bboy> Learning from my mistakes :)
[13:15:33] <robertmaxrees> sure.  so why did you choose to use $.map for this?
[13:15:35] <robertmaxrees> let's start there.
[13:16:41] <bboy> I actually got this one from here. I tried it but it didn't work as expected. So I'm checking for another solution
[13:16:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:16:58] <robertmaxrees> who told you to use $.map() to pull input values like this??
[13:17:27] <bboy> No, just someone told me to use $.map(), maybe I used it in a wrong way
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[13:17:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[13:17:40] <robertmaxrees> you probably want the other jquery map.
[13:18:11] <bboy> Ok :)
[13:18:18] <robertmaxrees> so go read up on it.
[13:19:10] <robertmaxrees> what i suggested was "	so instead of that for loop, you can .map() over all $('.eduField') and return an object containing the input names and their values.  ezpz :)" fwiw.
[13:24:12] <bboy> Ok, I will check it
[13:24:20] <bboy> thanks robertmaxrees
[13:24:26] <robertmaxrees> feel free to ask questions.
[13:24:44] <bboy> It's OK, I will check it
[13:24:44] <robertmaxrees> i think the larger issue is you're asking big, broad questions, instead of specific, pointed oned.
[13:24:48] <robertmaxrees> *ones
[13:25:04] <bboy> OK, thanks for your advice
[16:34:19] <forgotmynick> is there any shorter/nicer way to write this: var w = ($(this).attr('data-w') ? $(this).attr('data-w') : '1');  --- as a ternary but rather than calling $ twice?
[16:38:09] <robertmaxrees> var w = $(this).data('w') || '1';
[16:38:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:42:58] <bestdesign1> http://jsfiddle.net/yfkqhr9o/ this is a correct way to find is value contain x?
[16:44:02] <robertmaxrees> what browsers do you need to support?
[16:44:33] <bestdesign1> its fine with modern i think? what is best for older and latest too?
[16:44:42] <robertmaxrees> indexOf('x') > -1
[16:44:50] <bestdesign1> indexOf? ah yeah
[16:44:56] <bestdesign1> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:47:59] <robertmaxrees> there's also .contains(), but that doesn't work in IE.
[16:53:43] <bestdesign1> and how can i make that if not contain x then show alert only?
[16:53:57] <robertmaxrees> if (!hasX) {
[16:55:07] <robertmaxrees> fyi your code has a pretty big bug in it ;)
[16:55:31] <bestdesign1> really? and what :)
[16:55:38] <robertmaxrees> a bug that illustrates why you should use curlies for if statements, even though they're optional.
[16:56:52] <bestdesign1> curlies is {}?
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> yep
[16:57:05] <bestdesign1> ahh thank you!
[16:57:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:57:24] <bestdesign1> i learn a lot :)
[18:25:55] <forgotmynick> robertmaxrees: you've changed my life
[18:26:00] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:26:23] <forgotmynick> your answer to my question earlier (sorry for late response) var w = $(this).data('w') || '1';
[18:26:26] <forgotmynick> thank you
[18:26:47] <robertmaxrees> oh, sure.
