[00:02:36] <kevr> If I want to provide a function to be executed after animation, should i $.animate({ ... }, function() { /* Function to execute after */ }) ?
[01:52:11] <igcewieling> Is there any obvious reason why this selector:  $('.col')  doesn't match this element: <span class="char" data-col="6">X</span>   I don't see one, but console.log($('col').length);  shows 0
[01:53:03] <systemfault> Because it totally wrong.
[01:53:15] <systemfault> Gotta learn CSS.
[01:53:49] <igcewieling> Hmm?  What should it be?
[01:54:53] <systemfault> What do you want to select it by?
[01:55:02] <systemfault> class? data attribute?
[01:55:43] <igcewieling> I want to select elements which have both a "col" class and have a "data-col" attribute.
[01:55:58] <igcewieling> ah.  I'm an idiot.
[01:56:12] <systemfault> Glad you got it :)
[01:56:37] <igcewieling> I blame fatigue.

[03:05:34] <Anoopa> I am facing some issue with my jquery
[03:07:02] <Anoopa> could you please help me on it?
[03:09:21] <Anoopa> I have two dropdowns and according to value of 1st I am setting the visibility of the other
[03:09:25] <Anoopa>   $(document).ready(function () {         if (($("#response option:selected").val() == "Additional Approval") || ($("#response option:selected").val() == 'Request More Info')) {             $("#additional-pop").show();             $(document).scrollTo('#additional-pop');         }         $('#response').change(function () {             $("#response option:selected").val();             if (($("#response option:selected").val() == "Addit
[03:10:15] <Anoopa> But I am getting an error like "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: select"
[03:10:29] <Anoopa> what could be the issue?
[07:41:48] <varunramg> hi guys
[07:42:08] <varunramg> Iâ€™d like to contribute to the community. Where do I start?
[09:18:20] <ilithium> Hey guys, with CSS/SASS can I write a rule which says: for all TDs without a "class" attribute? Cheeky to ask here, but meh
[09:21:49] <shoky_> ilithium:   td:not([class])
[09:29:10] <ilithium> ooh thanks
[10:48:50] <psrathore> i have 3 inputs field1, field2, field3. Sum of field2 and field3 must be equal to field1. It is working, but i want that if i change field2 or field3 then it should give error also
[10:49:02] <psrathore> i have created a fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/3L4pba3y/4/
[11:19:55] <psrathore> https://jsfiddle.net/3L4pba3y/4/
[11:20:28] <psrathore> i want the validation on blur on field2 and field3
[13:34:04] <Sure_Saul> Good morning, afternoon, or evening, everyone.
[13:39:33] <Sure_Saul> I'm having an issue where my query results are turning up at the bottom of the page, instead of the <input>.  I'm currently moving the code to jsfiddle.net so its more easily referencable.  However, before I do all of that, does anyone have any quick pointers on this problem that I may have simply missed?
[14:01:59] <hhee> guys, is it real to localize jquery ui? for example datepicker
[14:37:28] <hhee> guys, i have multiple date fields. i attach all of them there id=datepicker as shown in docs http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#icon-trigger
[14:37:44] <hhee> but icon and select date ability show only in first field
[14:40:51] <hhee> oh got it
[14:40:58] <D-rex> You can have multiple elements with the same id
[14:41:24] <D-rex> cant*
[15:25:33] <Munt> hey folks, does document.ready take into account linked .js files ?  I mean is the document only ready once all linked files have downloaded ?
[15:28:13] <Munt> sorru i mean $( document ).ready()
[15:28:35] <systemfault> It doesn't care about anything but the DOM
[15:28:52] <systemfault> .ready() is executed when the DOM is parsed
[15:29:03] <systemfault> Or done parsing..
[15:29:48] <Munt> thanks systemfault !
[23:02:42] <phelix> I am not sure why I am having a problem with this. I have done this a million times before. http://pastebin.com/b9xanupi
[23:02:52] <phelix> Would would this be returning 0? Any ideas what i am missing?
[23:08:10] <phelix> I can not figure out why even though there are like 20 elements with this same class name. If i put it into a $.each it does nothing. So I have tried $('selector).length to see whats happening and it also returning 0... This shouldn't be this hard.
[23:12:12] <shoky_> phelix: wrong id in selector
[23:12:21] <shoky_> er wrong class
