[03:33:04] <Svarog2217> Hey guys!
[03:33:12] <Svarog2217> is this the right place to ask a question?
[03:35:42] <localh0st> Svarog2217: definetely not!
[03:36:00] <Svarog2217> really?
[03:36:01] <Svarog2217> :/
[03:37:08] <localh0st> Svarog2217: just ask the question
[03:37:35] <Svarog2217> ok, was hard to spot the sarcasm, although I suspect it :)
[03:37:40] <Svarog2217> *suspected
[03:37:49] <Svarog2217> I'm having a problem with concatenation in jquery
[03:38:31] * Cork sees a start tag without a close tag comming
[03:38:40] <Svarog2217> I'm trying to apply a function to an html ID, and want the ID to be created by joining the TEXT from this.class and this.id
[03:38:58] <Cork> Svarog2217: create a jsfiddle
[03:39:11] <Svarog2217> ok sec
[03:51:55] <Svarog2217> ok, this is where it works: https://jsfiddle.net/7akrkdsL/8/   and here is what i'm trying to achieve: https://jsfiddle.net/7akrkdsL/10/      Basically, when you click on a navigation link, it should take the selected class name "navbutton", add the selected ID name "btn1", combine them into "#navbuttonbtn1" and then do a .show() on that outcome
[03:53:37] <Svarog2217> I know the syntax in my example is crap, but I'm just trying to make obvious what the desired goal of the function is :)
[05:55:21] <Buoy172> how do I use ':first-child' with an jquery object?
[05:55:38] <Buoy172> I know I can do this $('#myId :first-child')
[05:55:44] <Cork> .children().first() ?
[05:56:29] <Cork> though that isn't the same as '#myId :first-child' (as that would be '#myId > :first-child'
[05:56:35] <Buoy172> Cork: that doesn't work
[05:56:49] <Cork> prob cause it isn't a direct child
[05:57:03] <Cork> could you show what you're trying to do in a jsfiddle?
[05:57:08] <Buoy172> ok, I want to select the first child of a <select id="myId">...</select>
[06:00:11] <Buoy172> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/bcd2y5wa/2/
[06:00:57] <Cork> Buoy172: you can't set state with attr
[06:01:00] <Cork> you want .prop
[06:01:19] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/bcd2y5wa/4/
[06:02:47] <Buoy172> Thanks Cork. What is attr() used for? Why shouldn't I use it?
[06:03:04] <Cork> it is for reading and setting attributes on the element
[06:03:08] <Cork> and you rarely want to use it
[06:03:49] <Cork> so what you did was calling elm.setAttribute('selected', 'true') not elm.selected = true
[06:03:51] <Buoy172> I don't quite understand the difference between attributes and props :/

[08:42:57] <Northwoods> i am looking for an alert notification to display session timeout , what can i use
[08:43:20] <Northwoods> something like modal window
[08:43:45] <Northwoods> https://notifyjs.com/ , i have trouble making custom notification with this using HTML
[08:45:03] <Northwoods> Can anyone suggest something ?
[08:57:41] <Cork> Northwoods: what's the problem with making a custom using html?
[08:58:15] <Cork> also i would prob make it as a banner at the top of the page
[09:04:15] <Northwoods> Cork , how would you use  html with notify js
[09:04:31] <Cork> i wouldn't use a lib at all
[09:10:50] <Northwoods> Cork, thats interesting
[09:11:20] <Northwoods> Cork, may i know , how will you go about it ?
[09:14:19] <Cork> Northwoods: https://jsfiddle.net/f2d6z8kb/9/
[09:14:54] <Cork> i don't really find a need for a lib for 3 lines of code
[09:22:10] <Northwoods> Cork, its not 3 lines of code
[09:22:13] <Northwoods> is it ?
[09:22:23] <Cork> it is, except for the click handler
[09:22:38] <Northwoods> Cork, can you show it ?
[09:22:43] <Northwoods> without handler
[09:22:45] <Cork> i just did
[09:22:50] <Cork> uh...
[09:22:57] <Cork> just read the code...
[09:23:00] <Cork> it is 5 lines...
[09:24:36] <Northwoods> oh i missed it
[09:24:41] <Northwoods> let me have a look
[09:25:09] <Northwoods> :)
[09:25:10] <Northwoods> nice
[09:25:16] <Northwoods> Thanks
[11:25:05] <catbadger> morning all
[11:26:15] <Northwoods> morning !
[11:26:57] <catbadger> :-)
[11:27:18] <grapheti> MorNaN
[11:27:34] <catbadger> Less NaN plz
[11:27:39] <catbadger> hhee
[11:28:13] <grapheti> typeof NaN > "number"
[11:28:17] <grapheti> > kek
[11:32:02] <catbadger> ugh... i have this promise wrapper class that allows arrays of promises stored by key in objects to be waited on independently so that many groups of promises can be active at a time. My boss says that the Promise API supports this... Is he right?
[11:32:36] <catbadger> because my wrapper is trash in 3.3.1... it was written for 1.x
[11:32:51] <catbadger> jsut trying to figure out my approach for fixing or rewriting.
[11:33:30] <catbadger> oh it stores each promise as $.Deffered and uses $.when.apply() to close out groups
[11:33:39] <catbadger> so yes it's jquery related

[11:45:06] <GeekMonkey_> Hey all I came across this codepen that does basically what I want....https://codepen.io/rsmm/pen/qoadyy but how could I get it to work with more than one video on the page
[11:45:36] <GeekMonkey_> to get the function to load multiple....possible read attributes from a div to get the youtube id
[11:45:37] <GeekMonkey_> etc
[11:46:38] <thykka> $('#player') should prolly be replaced with a reference to .each's 2nd argument
[11:47:18] <thykka> oh, there's more JS in the HTML section..
[11:47:27] <thykka> bleh
[11:47:51] <GeekMonkey_> thykka it isn't the best pen..... but the theory is there
[11:47:56] <GeekMonkey_> I didn't create it
[11:48:12] <thykka> well, you'll want to replace those global references to a single pen with an array, containing references to each video, then use array methods to iterate through the list
[11:48:40] <thykka> *single video
[11:49:04] <thykka> looks like the author has partly implemented this, but stopped half way through
[11:49:50] <thykka> I think it's kinda ugly though.. better just build from scratch :)
[12:30:15] <GeekMonkey_> thykka how would I setup my foreach loop for the playerinfolist
[12:30:23] <GeekMonkey_> https://codepen.io/rsmm/pen/qoadyy
[12:30:28] <GeekMonkey_> This is what I have so far
[12:31:22] <thykka> why the i++?
[12:31:28] <thykka> that can't end well
[12:32:42] <thykka> check out jquery's docs for .each; the first argument is the *current* index, the second (which you currently haven't named) refers to the current element in the array. So instead of doing players[i], you could do .each(function(i, e) {... e.pauseVideo()
[12:33:01] <thykka> you don't need to manually increment the index, that's what array iterators are for
[12:38:18] <GeekMonkey_> e.pauseVideo();
[12:40:42] <GeekMonkey_> now it says playVideo is undefined
[12:41:33] <thykka> oh, right.. because it's looping through a jquery collection, instead of the players array
[12:51:06] <GeekMonkey_> ok I am failing at this thykka..... any other hints
[12:55:07] <thykka> yeah, keep at it, use your browser's developer tools to figure what's actually happening and read the documentation regarding methods you're not familiar with :)

[15:40:18] <joobz> hey guys
[15:40:24] <joobz> any idea why this basic jquery wouldn't work ? https://pastebin.com/Jvbtgtmx
[15:40:46] <joobz> tried changing background colour and just placing text in a div.. it's like jquery aint running?
[15:42:20] <robertmaxrees> joobz you're missing jquery.
[15:42:23] <robertmaxrees> you only have jquery ui.
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> jqui doesn't include both.
[15:42:33] <joobz> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:42:44] <joobz> btw robertmaxrees
[15:42:48] <joobz> what's the best way to link in jquery?
[15:42:52] <joobz> like hte latest version
[15:43:01] <joobz> i just google to try find the latest version and then point to the website
[15:43:06] <joobz> but is there like a URL That is always the latest
[15:43:07] <joobz> ?
[15:43:18] <joobz> so i dont have to go searching for the latest each time.. same with ui?
[15:48:50] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away.
[15:48:51] <robertmaxrees> so
[15:48:54] <robertmaxrees> you don't want thtat.
[15:49:20] <robertmaxrees> joobz sometimes jquery updates break things - you want to make a conscious decision to upgrade when new versions are released.
[15:57:55] <hakerx1> this is why stick to tested and working solutions :)
[15:58:32] <robertmaxrees> the latest version of jquery would fit that description hakerx1
[15:58:40] <robertmaxrees> they're all tested and working.
[15:58:49] <hakerx1> so they say all...
[15:58:59] <hakerx1> until it breaks...
[15:59:05] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:59:17] <robertmaxrees> then literally no version of any software matches your description.
[15:59:23] <robertmaxrees> but that's a little excessive and pedantic.
[15:59:36] <hakerx1> 99% code is good
[15:59:48] <hakerx1> 1% is bugs and etc and failurs that may occur after release.
[16:00:04] <robertmaxrees> sure - that breakage can be introduced by things that aren't jquery.
[16:00:16] <hakerx1> depends on scenario.
[16:00:37] <robertmaxrees> the point I'm making is you don't want to automatically upgrade a dependency without running a sanity test to make sure said upgrade didn't break anything.
[16:00:40] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[16:01:05] <hakerx1> thats good solution i mostly wait for two weeks to be sure that is fine to upgrade or migrate :)
[16:01:16] <robertmaxrees> that's another way to do it.
[16:01:25] <robertmaxrees> though your testing should be able to allay those fears for you :)
[16:01:37] <hakerx1> like now i work cart bug for currencies :)
[16:01:56] <robertmaxrees> you aren't doing financial calculations with raw JS, right?
[16:01:56] <hakerx1> 24 currencies,suppliers can add products in 6 diffrenct currencies
[16:02:14] <hakerx1> in php but guy did spagettit that gone crazy with sessions
[16:02:27] <hakerx1> payment is done euro
[16:02:39] <robertmaxrees> so long as you're not doing calculations in JS, you should be fine ;)
[16:02:56] <hakerx1> but fun fact session went wrong fixer.io gone buggy
[16:03:07] <hakerx1> also found out that php ceil is buggy as hell...
[16:03:49] <hakerx1> so now i am able to get correct price in euro i fixed the bug but i has to run by hand 144 tests in user scanrio of every possible payment :D
[16:04:02] <robertmaxrees> you have unit tests, right?
[16:04:06] <hakerx1> tdd only
[16:04:09] <hakerx1> ow
[16:04:10] <hakerx1> no
[16:04:11] <hakerx1> BDD
[16:04:21] <hakerx1> test drive only ...
[16:04:26] <hakerx1> code is written bad
[16:04:33] <hakerx1> and tests are in possible...
[16:04:48] <hakerx1> so it's fun :D
[16:04:51] <robertmaxrees> writing tests would be a great time to refactor.
[16:05:16] <hakerx1> the base concept for currency calculator ir about 400 lines
[16:05:27] <hakerx1> with deep foreach loops
[16:05:34] <hakerx1> believe crazy shit...
[16:05:56] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) we've used unit tests as justification to refactor code before.
[16:06:00] <robertmaxrees> even the crazy bits.
[16:06:21] <hakerx1> project was made by coders who were learning
[16:06:31] <robertmaxrees> all developers are always learning ;)
[16:06:34] <hakerx1> and they even managed to break laravel ...
[16:06:44] <hakerx1> artisan is partial dead...
[16:06:56] <hakerx1> so try fix that ...
[16:07:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> we had a similar situation with one of our frameworks.
[16:07:14] <robertmaxrees> it happens.
[16:07:56] <hakerx1> and shit hit the fan because owner runs adverts for more income
[16:08:14] <hakerx1> and i am against the time for fixes that ar vital.
[16:08:40] <hakerx1> i inherited that spageti ...
[16:08:59] <hakerx1> two guys spent two years i think coding it and still it's like a bomb
[16:09:08] <hakerx1> fix one another problem keeps showing up...
[16:09:15] <robertmaxrees> that's development.
[16:09:38] <hakerx1> it's not development it's mess they just wrote something to just work
[16:09:44] <hakerx1> not to scale ir be able to modify...
[16:09:54] <hakerx1> or be
[16:10:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not really an uncommon scenario is what I mean.,
[16:11:01] <hakerx1> so i am in loop kinda was able to break out off it ...
[16:11:46] <hakerx1> or they say get it done in hours of work ..../
[16:11:57] <hakerx1> pure debug just takes half day...
[16:12:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's a common trap at a lot of places.
[16:12:16] <hakerx1> i am mostly freelancer,in outsource...
[16:12:41] <hakerx1> so things are diferent ...
[16:12:48] <hakerx1> no manual nothing...
[16:12:52] <hakerx1> code and target...
[16:12:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:13:01] <robertmaxrees> you're a freelancer who's being told how long things should take?
[16:13:14] <hakerx1> right now i insist on JOEL approach.
[16:13:25] <hakerx1> that is more reasonable.
[16:13:46] <robertmaxrees> the JOEL approach?
[16:13:54] <hakerx1> https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/
[16:14:27] <hakerx1> after all as full stack not just wana be but real full stack...
[16:14:29] <robertmaxrees> that's painfully dated.
[16:14:38] <hakerx1> even so it gives the concept.
[16:14:41] <robertmaxrees> some great wisdom.
[16:14:43] <robertmaxrees> but still old.
[16:15:03] <hakerx1> last month i spend 48-72h non stop coding
[16:15:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:15:14] <hakerx1> to fix and launch project witouth sleeping...
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:15:21] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad sign heh.
[16:15:24] <hakerx1> with bugs that are minor...
[16:15:33] <hakerx1> now has fix them ...
[16:15:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, something is kind of broken there.
[16:16:31] <hakerx1> many mistakes junior devs made big website...
[16:16:51] <hakerx1> and senior gets the showel to clean up ...
[16:17:23] <hakerx1> like was in cms system exploit any user could be superadmin
[16:17:25] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad sign.
[16:17:35] <robertmaxrees> your jr devs should be involved in those cleanups.
[16:17:37] <hakerx1> and view orders and etc...
[16:17:52] <hakerx1> they were just fired...
[16:17:56] <hakerx1> and i replaced them.
[16:18:01] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:18:09] <robertmaxrees> that's super backwards heh
[16:18:29] <hakerx1> well life is complicated so this project ...
[16:18:43] <robertmaxrees> complexity has nothing to do with those problems :)
[16:18:52] <hakerx1> i was left with code that i didn't know and well last month was worst of them all...
[16:19:21] <hakerx1> now i got familiar with code that is there and i am able to pull off few tricks ...
[16:20:55] <hakerx1> hard to judge after all this time...
[16:21:07] <robertmaxrees> what's hard to judge?
[16:21:39] <hakerx1> i point toward complexity answer.
[16:22:12] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:22:45] <hakerx1> also i am not able to contact those two smart asses...
[16:22:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:23:06] <hakerx1> so alot debug involves in every work step...
[16:23:46] <hakerx1> and automated test won't cut it here..
[16:23:59] <hakerx1> like on my private vps test website
[16:24:11] <robertmaxrees> you lost me.
[16:24:12] <hakerx1> everything sometimes on live someting just breaks...
[16:24:34] <hakerx1> ^^
[16:24:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your environment is a mess then.
[16:25:10] <hakerx1> i should finish eat cerials ^^
[16:25:26] <hakerx1> aha ^^
[16:27:07] * hakerx1 leaving to watch anime afk from mirc...
[16:32:50] <joobz> hey guys.. i have a background image applied to 'html'. Is it possible to fadeout the opacity of that image to say 50% progressive, but just do this to the background-image that's on 'html' rather than the whole 'html' object?
[16:34:57] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41152161/opacity-animation-for-background-image
[16:44:12] <robertmaxrees> joobz that answer your question?
[16:44:21] <joobz> im trying to apply it now
[16:44:27] <joobz> not sure if it will work cos it's on 'html'
[16:44:32] <joobz> using ::before on it, never tried
[16:44:40] <robertmaxrees> ::before exists in your html.
[16:44:44] <robertmaxrees> but you can't select that using js.
[16:48:15] <joobz> if i can't select it with JS that might be an issue
[16:48:24] <joobz> trying to add opacity and remove it on an event
[16:48:36] <joobz> JS will fire the event
[16:48:47] <robertmaxrees> you can do it via css though.
[16:49:05] <robertmaxrees> .myClass::before
[16:49:20] <robertmaxrees> then just add myClass to the element.
[16:53:27] <joobz> looks like it may work
[16:53:34] <joobz> just trying to fix image dimensions
[16:53:46] <joobz> i had it taking the whole page before now it's much less
[16:55:52] <joobz> hmm
[16:56:18] <joobz> so with the new code, the background only fills as far as the html scrolls down the page. in my case the html only goes half the page, so i have half the page without a background image
[16:56:37] <joobz> https://pastebin.com/EM2eHkuq
[16:56:48] <joobz> that is what i used to use which basically filled the whole html element
[16:56:55] <joobz> despite the content only going half the page
[16:57:01] <joobz> sorry, it filled the whole window even
[16:57:09] <robertmaxrees> care to make a fiddle?
[16:58:47] <joobz> sure ill try reduce the mess :P
[16:59:45] <robertmaxrees> wait
[16:59:46] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[17:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you mentioned "what i used to use"
[17:00:08] <robertmaxrees> are you using now?
[17:02:40] <joobz> https://jsfiddle.net/gb2jkcr8/3/
[17:03:01] <joobz> i incorporated the code from that link you posted
[17:03:36] <joobz> before the background image (in the pastebin) used to mean although 'moo' was only at the top of the page, the background image filled the whole window
[17:03:49] <robertmaxrees> okay so back up
[17:03:50] <joobz> now the background image only fills as much content that there is in html
[17:04:24] <joobz> there is a bit of noise in that code.. but it's largely there. If you hover over HTML it fades out as expected which is great :P
[17:04:35] <robertmaxrees> right, slow down :)
[17:04:39] <joobz> heh
[17:04:41] <robertmaxrees> you just need the image on the background, right?
[17:05:24] <robertmaxrees> because the ::before may very well be entirely unnecessary
[17:06:17] <joobz> yea, the background on the whole HTML
[17:06:28] <robertmaxrees> right, so you didn't need to add ::before at all >.>
[17:06:37] <joobz> oh
[17:06:53] <joobz> but the other requirement robertmaxrees, is to make sure the background image fills the whole page
[17:07:12] <robertmaxrees> try killing the ::before
[17:07:15] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:07:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/gb2jkcr8/8/
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[17:08:12] <joobz> that fades out the 'moo' text though
[17:08:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:08:24] <joobz> need that to stay as it and just add the opacity to the background image
[17:08:33] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:08:36] <robertmaxrees> okay, let's back up.
[17:08:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:08:36] <joobz> sorry man
[17:08:41] <joobz> probablty not being clear enough
[17:08:44] <robertmaxrees> nono - i'
[17:08:54] <robertmaxrees> *I did a poor job of exlaining.
[17:10:01] <robertmaxrees> okay, so starting here: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/transparent-background-images/
[17:10:49] <robertmaxrees> basically, you want to go back to your original css.
[17:10:55] <robertmaxrees> and then add stuff - no need to set ::before.

[21:54:06] <joobz> hey guys.. anyone semi-decemt with bootstrap?
[21:55:20] <joobz> just wondering if it's possible to set it up so that a if you have a row with multiple columns, that the row take 100% width and each column within that row is evenly spaced, but without having to specify a fixed class number on it (eg, without having to calculate it manually and define those -3 -2 classes to it). Is there a dynamic way that u can do it by assigning the same class to each column?
