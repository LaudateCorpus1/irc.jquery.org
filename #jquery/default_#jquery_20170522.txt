[04:16:59] <jquery-novice> $('> li', $sortableFields).eq(0).before($li); //What is the meaning of this line ?
[04:34:40] <Cork> jquery-novice: a short hand for $sortableFields.find('> li').eq(0).before($li)
[04:35:06] <Cork> that could also be written as $sortableFields.children('li').first().before($li)
[04:36:26] <jquery-novice> Cork, thanx. the issue is : if i have loop and values coming 1,2,3 then this  $sortableFields.children('li').first().before($li) making it in html 3,2,1 but it should be 1,2,3
[04:36:34] <jquery-novice> hope you got my workds
[04:37:00] <Cork> jquery-novice: ya, as it always insert the new element at the top of the list it means it will be reverted
[04:37:12] <jquery-novice> so any solution ?
[04:37:29] <Cork> you could insert the elements as an array (meaning no loop)
[04:37:35] <Cork> or do .last().after()
[04:38:24] <Cork> there are plenty of other solutions too, but it requires more info about what your doing
[05:11:13] <Al_nz1> I have a dropdown which uses optgroup. I know I can get the optgroup name of the selected item, but in a similar way to dropdown option and value I need to store and retrieve a id (value) for the selected optgroup - is there a way to do this????
[06:03:25] <PereP_> hi
[06:04:36] <PereP_> I'm attempting a basic HTTP authorization via ajax, and in fact it works, but...
[06:04:58] <PereP_> ...on first attempt I still get an auth popup in my browser
[06:05:11] <Mement> When I include jQuery in my website, all external links are opened in a new window. How can I suppress this behavior?
[06:05:21] <PereP_> althought in subsequent calls it properly authenticated
[06:08:50] <Woet> Mement: thats not jQuerys fault.
[06:09:22] <PereP_> any hints to my auth annoyance?
[06:10:08] <Woet> PereP_: are you going to show your code?
[06:10:46] <PereP_> ok
[06:11:14] <Woet> PereP_: and the reason it works in subsequent calls is because HTTP auth remembers your initial login
[06:12:38] <PereP_> yeah, that's the strange thing
[06:13:31] <Woet> PereP_: its not a strange thing, thats how HTTP auth works.
[06:13:46] <Woet> PereP_: why would it ask you to login for every single request? that'd be annoying
[06:13:49] <PereP_> I mean... is any kind of "standard reason" for not "catching" the authenticated page on 1st time after ajax authentication?
[06:14:02] <Woet> PereP_: still waiting for your code.
[06:15:12] <PereP_> here it goes: https://pastebin.com/gGBQ8AUC
[06:15:20] <PereP_> it's a very simple ajax call
[06:15:49] <PereP_> I tried both passing the auth param with headers : { ... } and with beforeSend: ...
[06:16:31] <PereP_> also what I'm attempting to auth should be loaded into an iframe after successfull authentication (and it does but in subsequent attempts)
[06:17:16] <PereP_> "urlIframe" and "encoded" have the proper param values -- that is, the URL to authenticate and the encoded login + pass in base64, respectively
[06:18:00] <PereP_> also attempted using OPTIONS instead of GET as I've seen in some SO suggestions...
[06:18:13] <PereP_> tried using json as dataType with no luck...
[06:18:42] <PereP_> (in that case, the popup is not appearing but neither any content is loaded)
[06:20:14] <PereP_> I'm going to try a json to html converter
[06:20:46] <PereP_> oh, if it existed, of course
[06:25:51] <cxeq> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44095752/replacing-an-existing-script-and-running-it-with-javascript-jquery
[06:27:08] <PereP_> any hints?
[06:29:42] <Woet> PereP_: why dont you just include it in the URL?
[06:30:22] <Woet> PereP_: http://user:pass@yoururl.com/
[06:30:47] <PereP_> Woet: I don't want this info so plainly visible...
[06:31:08] <Woet> PereP_: you realise "encoded" is just base64 right..?
[06:31:26] <PereP_> also I think I read somewhere that that syntax was going to be unsupported starting some version of Chrome...
[06:32:19] <graingert> cxeq: wow, don't do that
[06:32:33] <graingert> cxeq: just write all your scripts in one .js file don't load them dynamically
[06:32:54] <cxeq> new script is generated quite often
[06:33:28] <Woet> PereP_: either way, that code you have should work. if it prompts you, your "encoded" is incorrect.
[06:34:09] <PereP_> Woet: but if it's encoded incorrectly, then it wouldn't be authenticated on following calls...
[06:34:16] <PereP_> and its value is not changing...
[06:34:21] <Woet> PereP_: are you not entering the username and password when it prompts you?
[06:34:35] <PereP_> nope
[06:34:38] <PereP_> I just cancel
[06:34:43] <cxeq> perhaps every 30 seconds or less
[06:34:44] <PereP_> try againg and it works
[06:37:37] <PereP_> Woet: I have to note that the code it's triggered on a click
[07:28:24] <zenox> how are you supposed to set an auto-incrementing column in lovefield
[07:28:35] <zenox> atm i'm having to manually pass in id's which is dumb
[08:20:30] <cxeq> graingert: new script is generated every 30 seconds
[08:20:59] <graingert> cxeq: what's it got in?
[08:21:21] <graingert> cxeq: send the data as JSON and write a function that processes it
[08:21:27] <cxeq> its generated by a graphing module for python named bokeh
[08:22:00] <cxeq> essentially that is what I am asking how to do
[08:22:45] <cxeq> you can see an example of the script here https://pastebin.com/6T8WZQys
[08:23:24] <cxeq> it is tied to 3 divs that I have already figured out how to insert, but I am a bit lost on how to correctly insert and run the script after the divs
[08:24:47] <graingert> cxeq: wow that's dumb. Bokeh should not do that
[08:25:06] <cxeq> it has ways to do direct ajax and other stuff
[08:25:20] <cxeq> but I am truly noob in regard to jquery and ajax, and couldnt figure them out
[08:25:31] <cxeq> this is just a flask app for my house and non-proudction
[08:25:49] <cxeq> production*
[09:10:31] <meerz> got this error when put this code --> https://jsfiddle.net/wm2vt8os/1/
[09:11:14] <Woet> meerz: nope, not happening on your jsfiddle.
[09:11:23] <Woet> meerz: probably because you didn't even bother to load jquery in it.
[09:11:52] <meerz> found solution =)
[09:11:56] <Woet> which was?
[09:12:01] <meerz> Woet: that was just testing
[09:12:13] <Woet> meerz: you don't test jquery code without loading jquery
[09:12:40] <meerz> solved --> https://jsfiddle.net/wm2vt8os/2/
[09:13:23] <meerz> oh, sorry, just used jsfiddle to print the code
[09:14:18] <meerz> here is the working solution --> http://jsfiddle.net/4ns0mdcf/
[09:19:19] <Hollusionist> $(".big").delay(10000).remove(); shouldnt this remove after 10 seconds?
[09:20:54] <Hollusionist> oh i see i have to use .queue()
[09:39:42] <Cork> Hollusionist: functions that isn't animated doesn't wait for delays
[09:39:49] <Cork> so ya, queue is what you want
[09:48:11] <Hollusionist> funny thing is that when loading a page via ajax and displaying it within a newly created jqueryUIdialog
[09:48:41] <Hollusionist> i can make the code withint queue run exactly after the dialog has opened/is displaying the new page
[09:50:01] <Hollusionist> $(".element-within-dialog").delay().queue(function () { console.log($(this).width()) });
[09:51:27] <Hollusionist> will return the elements width. whereas a console.log($(".element-within-dialog").width()) will return 0
[09:53:06] <Hollusionist> and using delay(1000) will run the code exactly 1 second after the dialog has opened. is this safe to use/rely on?
[10:00:06] <Hollusionist> $foo.click((e) => { var $this = $(e.currentTarget); });
[10:00:21] <Hollusionist> is the correct way to get $(this) within arrow functions?
[10:11:10] <codecutter> i have a counter that i'm incrementing using 'count++'  how do i get it to  output 1.0 instead of 1?
[10:13:59] <codecutter> except 10++
[10:14:20] <codecutter> sorry that should be 01 not 1.0
[10:33:04] <Hollusionist> "0".repeat(2-number.toString().length) + number.toString()
[10:35:03] <cxeq> ("0" + myNumber).slice(-2);
[10:36:17] <cxeq> or perhaps  x > 9 ? "" + x: "0" + x;
[10:37:00] <reynierpm> is there any channel for jquery-ui or I should ask my question here?
[10:37:16] <cxeq> negative numbers would take some more work
[10:37:32] <cxeq> Math.abs maybe
[10:42:49] <PereP> hi
[10:43:48] <PereP> which is the best way to reload the contents of an iframe? $("iframe").load($("iframe").attr("src"))?
[10:55:40] <Dro> hello, how can I make an input contains the sum of all numeric inputs with jquery ?
[11:06:58] <PereP> I've got this problem I cannot solve by any means
[11:07:16] <PereP> I'm trying to HTTP basic authenticate via Ajax, something I've already accomplished
[11:07:44] <PereP> then, after successfully logged in, I'd like to load the contents of the AUTHENTICATED site
[11:07:54] <PereP> well, I cannot success with the later one
[11:08:05] <PereP> I always need a couple of attempts
[11:08:46] <PereP> I mean... I have this code which run on a click - it executes and I get a successful reply
[11:12:00] <PereP> then, no matter what I try: on the .done(){..}, on the complete: function({..}), on the .success(){...}...
[11:12:41] <PereP> I even tried with a statusCode: { 401: function(test){ ...wait and reload... })
[11:12:57] <PereP> I'll always fail miserably
[11:13:40] <PereP> it's like if it needed some time to notice it's authenticated before being able to allot ajax .load(), etc.
[11:16:24] <PereP> I need serious advice
[11:45:38] <robertmaxrees> goooooood morning
[14:17:16] <reynierpm> hi there, can any help me here? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44119439/how-to-build-optgroup-with-option-from-json ??
[14:19:41] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm because you're conflating how things are structure it looks like.
[14:20:45] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm check out https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y086oomp/2/
[14:20:53] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm making it even more explicit: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y086oomp/3/
[14:26:44] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ok I am trying to see where my issue is
[14:26:56] <robertmaxrees> you'
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> *you're basically "Up" one level too high.
[14:27:42] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, hmmm
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> still lost?
[14:28:26] <reynierpm> kind of but I'll get it
[14:28:56] <reynierpm> so the problem is the array?
[14:29:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y086oomp/5/
[14:29:29] <robertmaxrees> you're doing $.each() on data - but data only has one index.
[14:29:50] <reynierpm> ohhh data[0], then?
[14:29:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:29:57] <robertmaxrees> or
[14:30:05] <robertmaxrees> do you control where this is coming from?
[14:30:30] <reynierpm> where I build the JSON?
[14:30:32] <reynierpm> yes
[14:30:43] <robertmaxrees> I'd change that.
[14:30:53] <reynierpm> how?
[14:31:27] <reynierpm> I can share that piece of code is not so big
[14:31:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y086oomp/7/
[14:31:43] <robertmaxrees> wait - are you manually generating that JSON?
[14:31:51] <robertmaxrees> or are you using a library to do it for you?
[14:32:18] <reynierpm> yes, I am doing it manually, I mean the array for the JSON, the library used is coming from Symfony framework
[14:32:55] <reynierpm> here https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/Ny6aMT-sTgWe6mAgfA7vR15M1UNdIGYhyRLivL9gydE=
[14:33:03] <reynierpm> that's the piece of code to build the array
[14:33:11] <robertmaxrees> is this php?
[14:33:17] <reynierpm> yes
[14:33:20] <reynierpm> :D
[14:33:21] <robertmaxrees> i don't know php hjaha
[14:33:26] <reynierpm> hahaha lol
[14:33:35] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[14:33:47] <robertmaxrees> you should just let a library convert your data into JSON instead of manually doing it.
[14:33:58] <reynierpm> well if your idea is to remove the outer from the JSON I already did that
[14:34:20] <reynierpm> that's what the library does but I need to build the data first before send it to the library
[14:34:22] <robertmaxrees> my idea is that you shouldn't be manually outputting and formatting JSON in the first place lol
[14:34:33] <robertmaxrees> either way, that outer array was superfluous.
[14:37:40] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, your example here https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y086oomp/7/ is not working either
[14:38:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sayuing it WILL work.
[14:38:36] <robertmaxrees> just pointing you in the right direction.
[14:38:40] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ahh okok
[14:38:44] <reynierpm> yup I got it
[14:38:45] <reynierpm> thx
[16:06:53] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
[16:09:00] * Lukia weeeeee back robertmaxrees
[16:12:19] <Deusdeorum> how can i check the state of this boxes? if input has 1,2,3 or 4 in it check the corresponding box (imagine clicking the boxes then leaving the page and come back and the box should be pre filled already). https://jsfiddle.net/bbro8e1m/
[16:13:09] <dan_j> Hi. I've got an iframe which shows a document from a different domain. I'm trying to access the parent's functions from the iframe's code, but getting 'permission denied' because it's cross domain.
[16:13:16] <dan_j> Is it possible to override this functionality?
[16:13:45] <dan_j> $( "#dialog_paymentgateway" , window.parent.document).dialog( "close" );
[16:14:06] <robertmaxrees> dan_j do you control the site in the iframe?
[16:14:17] <dan_j> No. It's our payment gateway provider
[16:14:25] <robertmaxrees> then nope.  you can't override CORS.
[16:14:28] <dan_j> I can control the html output, but not the server
[16:15:08] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum you want to bind an event listener to the input.
[16:15:27] <robertmaxrees> i might do $('.myinput').on('input', function() {});
[16:15:56] <Lukia> nop
[16:16:42] <Lukia> $(".my_persistent_parent").on('myCSSinputSelector', 'myevent', function(){})
[16:16:54] <robertmaxrees> Lukia nope.
[16:17:03] <robertmaxrees> Lukia that's the wrong syntax for .on()
[16:17:08] <Lukia> nop
[16:17:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:17:21] <Lukia> selector/event/handler
[16:17:22] <robertmaxrees> \you confusing it with .delegate()
[16:17:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:17:33] <robertmaxrees> event, [optional] selector, handler
[16:17:52] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees but the value is already there, just need to be evaluated on page load (if it is there) still need a listener for that?
[16:18:12] <Lukia> https://api.jquery.com/on/ robertmaxrees
[16:18:15] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum ah you don't wnat to do change it when the input changes?  then no need for an event listener.
[16:18:17] <robertmaxrees> Lukia https://i.imgur.com/15Q02dX.png
[16:18:35] <Lukia> so what ?
[16:18:37] <robertmaxrees> Lukia you reverse the selector and event.
[16:18:44] <robertmaxrees> *reversed
[16:18:51] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees nah i already got that working, but if the value is already there it should be pre checked =)
[16:19:16] <Lukia> you need to learn to read robertmaxrees
[16:19:24] <robertmaxrees> Lukia wtf
[16:19:29] <robertmaxrees> Lukia your answer is backwards.
[16:19:37] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum then read the .val() of the input and use .filter() to get the .anser whose data-val matches it.
[16:19:41] <robertmaxrees> *.answer
[16:19:45] <robertmaxrees> Lukia feel free to prove me wrong.
[16:19:52] <Lukia> do you know what 'on()' method do ?
[16:19:59] <robertmaxrees> it binds an event listener.
[16:20:09] <Deusdeorum> okok, that sounds reasonable
[16:20:24] <robertmaxrees> Lukia your example was trying to use the delegated syntax, but you swapped two of the argse.
[16:20:30] <Lukia> it create an event on a parent selector to detect an event on a child selector
[16:20:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:20:36] <Lukia> that's what on() do
[16:20:38] <robertmaxrees> that's an opotional use of it.
[16:20:50] <robertmaxrees> but the version you supplied reversed two of the args./
[16:21:14] <Lukia> oh, do as you please...
[16:21:18] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:21:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:21:42] <Lukia> you don't want to learn, don't learn
[16:21:45] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[16:21:54] <robertmaxrees> the docs agree with what i'm saying lol
[16:22:19] <Lukia> what are you saying ? you can't make a on() method work
[16:22:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying you have the argument order wrong.
[16:22:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8fmrzw1b/
[16:22:55] <robertmaxrees> this uses your version.  it does not work.
[16:23:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8fmrzw1b/1/ this uses the correct order for the arguments.
[16:23:21] <Lukia> yeah I made a mistake... omg
[16:23:29] <Lukia> but don't care
[16:23:37] <Lukia> why your code doesn't work ?
[16:23:41] <Lukia> out of scope
[16:23:42] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:23:57] <robertmaxrees> i just explained that first example uses your example of argument order.
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> which is wrong.
[16:24:15] <Lukia> look for why it's not working instead telling me I'm wring
[16:24:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8fmrzw1b/1/ this uses the correct order, which fuinctions as expected.
[16:24:19] <Lukia> wrong*
[16:24:30] <robertmaxrees> becauise the argument order is incorrect.
[16:24:51] <Lukia> we don't care about that, doc is here
[16:24:54] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum did my filter suggestion make sense?
[16:24:59] <robertmaxrees> Lukia the docs agree with what i'm saying.
[16:25:08] <robertmaxrees> so I'm not sure why you're so convinced that you're correct.
[16:25:29] <Lukia> omg yeah, you're the god, the perfect doc learner
[16:25:36] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees it does i just have to figure out how to do it properly, i rarely to front end!
[16:25:36] <robertmaxrees> i never said I'
[16:25:51] <Deusdeorum> do*
[16:25:53] <Lukia> what is the problem robertmaxrees ?
[16:26:01] <robertmaxrees> *i'm a god.  you came after me and insisted you were right, regused to try to actually provide evicence to support that, and then got short with me about it.
[16:26:07] <Lukia> shut up
[16:26:13] <Lukia> what's wrong ?
[16:26:21] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:26:25] <robertmaxrees> nothing is wrong duder.
[16:26:34] <robertmaxrees> no need to get short with me.
[16:26:53] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum if you get stuck lemme know :)  it's pretty easy.
[16:27:26] <Deusdeorum> Yes, i am cooking though. I will finish up later/tomorrow morning lol :D
[16:27:34] <robertmaxrees> haha all good!
[16:27:43] <Deusdeorum> just needed some tips on doing it
[16:27:46] <Deusdeorum> thank you
[16:27:48] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[16:38:57] <reynierpm> let's say I am getting all the checkboxes contained in a DIV, how do I check which one is checked and which one not? I need to separate the checked ones from the non checked and possibly make an array of them
[16:39:18] <reynierpm> I am working on this https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/2vn3af73/ but iterating over each of them how do I get which one is checked or not?
[16:40:01] <robertmaxrees> .filter() 'em.
[16:40:47] <reynierpm> ok, let's try
[16:41:09] <francuz> i don't exactly know what you're doing there, but at first sight it looks like you'd be better off using radio instead of checkboxes wouldn't you ?
[16:41:23] <francuz> other question : when i want to .remove() an element(a line in a table in my case), is there an easy way of easing it out ?
[16:41:24] <robertmaxrees> hah, valid point.
[16:41:50] <robertmaxrees> francuz you you animate it first.
[16:41:58] <robertmaxrees> though tables are finicky with styling like that.
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> reynierp why aren't you using a radio?
[16:42:54] <reynierpm> francuz, robertmaxrees guys this company is a crazyness, the client is more crazy even, I did know a radio works perfectly for this but they wan't a checkbox because it's nicer o.O WTF!!!!!
[16:43:07] <robertmaxrees> "nicer" how?
[16:43:09] <reynierpm> already answered you robertmaxrees :-(
[16:43:19] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, they look better than a radio
[16:43:32] <robertmaxrees> gonna confuse the hell out of your end users but OK ;)
[16:44:17] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, I am pretty sure they will change it when I get this done, they love to do that, they make me work in something and in the next few days they don't like it how it was and then they want to go back
[16:44:28] <francuz> http://jsfiddle.net/mq8Zq/
[16:44:38] <francuz> this way your radio looks like checkboxes
[16:44:42] <robertmaxrees> jajajaja
[16:44:45] <robertmaxrees> *hahahaha
[16:44:48] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[16:45:14] <reynierpm> francuz, upsss I have to teach the frontend guy, which I am not, to do that
[16:45:19] <reynierpm> I am a backend doing frontend
[16:45:34] <robertmaxrees> reynierp then why are you modifying this code???
[16:45:53] <reynierpm> lol if I don't do that I'll be fired
[16:45:54] <robertmaxrees> "that part isn't my problem but this other part is, but i'm not a frontend developer"
[16:46:35] <reynierpm> I've to switch several times there is only one frontend developer for 12 backend crazy right?
[16:46:47] <reynierpm> well company issues, anyway I have to do the job no matter what
[16:46:50] <robertmaxrees> guess i don't understand why the hard distinction but OK ;)
[16:47:06] <robertmaxrees> you can also use the :checked selector here.
[16:47:50] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, that's what I am trying to do
[16:48:06] <robertmaxrees> feel free to share an updated fiddle if you're stuck.
[16:48:24] <reynierpm> https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/2vn3af73/
[16:48:27] <reynierpm> that one
[16:48:46] <robertmaxrees> it's a psuedo, not a tag :)
[16:48:59] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[16:50:08] <reynierpm> ohhh ok, almost loss my mind on this
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> though this seems odd
[16:50:39] <robertmaxrees> you want the parent with thge selected child?
[16:51:10] <reynierpm> no, there can be only one parent and the rest I called children but it's not
[16:51:23] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:51:52] <reynierpm> for example if I check 108393 then that becomes my parent and the rest should goes to children = [111876, 111430, 111189]
[16:52:00] <reynierpm> that's the idea I think I've it now
[16:52:56] <robertmaxrees> "parent" is confusiong me here, but really you just want the checked box, right?
[16:53:46] <reynierpm> I got it https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/2vn3af73/2/
[16:53:58] <robertmaxrees> .each() is the wrong tool here fwiw.
[16:54:31] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, ok, if you can help me there I'll be glad
[16:54:36] <reynierpm> :)
[16:54:42] <reynierpm> remember I am a basic frontend
[17:04:14] <robertmaxrees> ;back sorry
[17:06:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2vn3af73/4/ reynierp
[17:08:57] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm also: can you change that markup[ at all?>
[17:10:53] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2vn3af73/5/
[17:24:22] <TViernion> Situation:  Customer Details Page for a CRM app.  Would use use jquery when an "edit" button is clicked to change fields into input fields for updating?
[17:24:48] <robertmaxrees> depends
[17:24:58] <TViernion> I'm all ears.
[17:25:57] <robertmaxrees> is there already a framework in play?
[17:26:08] <TViernion> No
[17:26:15] <robertmaxrees> and are you already using jquery?
[17:26:18] <TViernion> i'm looking at a custom inhouse application i'm about to build
[17:26:30] <TViernion> consider this is from scratch and the canvas is blank
[17:26:49] <robertmaxrees> ah, then start right: pick a framework and use that.
[17:27:03] <robertmaxrees> it'll have everything you need to handle that.
[17:27:32] <TViernion> What frame work would be good to look at
[17:28:03] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices: react, vue, angular, riot....
[17:29:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd look at the first two.
[17:30:03] <TViernion> react and vue?
[17:30:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[17:34:50] <taplar> ie and angular sux
[17:40:38] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[17:40:55] <taplar> ran into some funkness where the inputs would stop responding
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> what version of IE?
[17:41:10] <taplar> apparently not an uncommon with the marrage of those two
[17:41:14] <taplar> IE9-11
[17:41:17] <robertmaxrees> ah
[17:43:39] <taplar> got around it by forcing a focus on the inputs.  but just weird i needed to do that
[18:28:03] <Violinist> babelbabelbable
[19:12:04] <Knudn> i have a password stored in a database, but when i goes into the database and look in the column where it is supposed to be i only find a string like this “code, -34,34,54,111,-32…” Any of you know why this is?
[19:12:04] <Knudn> I am very new to programming so you must have me excused if it is a stupid question
[19:28:15] <Krantz> Hello. Question about datepicker: I got the jqueryUI script at the headers in index.php, I call addon.php inside a div when user selects from a list, and addon.php has the datepicker field. How do I make the function datepicker available to the subsequent php files called from index.php?
[19:37:41] <robertmaxrees> Krantz php files have nothing to do with it >>>
[19:37:43] <robertmaxrees> *>.>
[19:38:04] <robertmaxrees> when you say "i call addon.php", are you ajaxing that file in?
[19:38:20] <robertmaxrees> or is it server-side?
[19:38:38] <Krantz> Yes, when user selects from a <li>, jquery .loads(addon.php) in a div
[19:39:03] <Krantz> inside addon.php is an input that I want to use the datepicker with
[19:39:14] <robertmaxrees> and you're including jqui in the <head> tag of your page?
[19:39:27] <Krantz> yes, the head is in index.php
[19:39:43] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, js doesn't care about the php - just the markup.
[19:39:54] <robertmaxrees> since jqui is generally globally registered, you just use it.
[19:40:24] <robertmaxrees> .load('someurl', function() { /* init datepicker in here */ });
[19:40:29] <Krantz> I tried, no luck :( If I put an input  in index.php to test, it works... but the input in addon.php doesnt work
[19:40:54] <robertmaxrees> mind showing your js?
[19:40:59] <robertmaxrees> in a bpaste or something?
[19:41:02] <Krantz> sure
[19:41:33] <Krantz> this is in "index.php":    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[19:42:06] <Krantz> this is in addon.php (where the <input> is):     <script>
[19:42:06] <Krantz>     $( function() {
[19:42:06] <Krantz>    $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();
[19:42:06] <Krantz>     } );
[19:42:06] <Krantz>     </script>
[19:42:09] <robertmaxrees> woah nonono
[19:42:16] <robertmaxrees> use a paste service.
[19:42:21] <robertmaxrees> instead of the channel pls.
[19:42:26] <Krantz> sorry
[19:42:28] <Krantz> my mistake
[19:42:31] <robertmaxrees> all good.
[19:43:31] <Krantz> this is inside addon.php (where the input is): https://pastebin.com/CRaV8rbS
[19:43:42] <robertmaxrees> heh and the .load() call?
[19:44:43] <Krantz> this is all my my <head> in index.php https://pastebin.com/FQmA3VDr
[19:45:31] <robertmaxrees> oh btw you're loading jquery twice, which is a no-no.
[19:45:41] <graingert> Krantz: don't use <script> without src
[19:45:56] <Krantz> when user clicks the <li>, the JS at the bottom makes the call: https://pastebin.com/N2BfSF6B
[19:46:01] <robertmaxrees> not helpful right now graingert :)
[19:46:06] <robertmaxrees> lemme walk him through it
[19:46:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah okay.
[19:46:16] <robertmaxrees> so
[19:46:34] <robertmaxrees> first off - you shouldn't be inlining script tags.  especially in that content you're loading via ajax.
[19:46:40] <Krantz> (sorry im not even close to be expert on jquery, im unity developer designing my admin service)
[19:47:31] <Krantz> ok...what do you mean by inlining? putting the code inside the html? should I use a separate ,js file?=
[19:47:39] <robertmaxrees> separate JS file.
[19:47:43] <Krantz> noted
[19:47:52] <robertmaxrees> also: does contenido include that UL of the navigation?
[19:47:56] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it...
[19:47:57] <robertmaxrees> right?
[19:48:04] <Krantz> exactly
[19:48:14] <Krantz> inside contenido, the script ills the php clicked
[19:48:21] <robertmaxrees> so why is https://pastebin.com/N2BfSF6B this file getting ajaxed in?
[19:48:24] <robertmaxrees> or is it not?
[19:48:27] <Krantz> btw no
[19:48:31] <Krantz> contenido is outside the UL
[19:48:39] <Krantz> or -- the UL is outside contenido
[19:48:49] <robertmaxrees> oh it is?  easy fix anyway.
[19:48:54] <robertmaxrees> so first fix: https://pastebin.com/FQmA3VDr
[19:49:06] <robertmaxrees> remove one of the two copies of jquery - probably <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[19:49:18] <robertmaxrees> since the 3.x series is buggy with jqui last i checked.
[19:49:24] <Krantz> ok
[19:49:26] <Krantz> doing it right now
[19:50:17] <Krantz> done
[19:50:24] <robertmaxrees> second, make an external file for all that js.
[19:51:06] <robertmaxrees> the reason you want to get it out of the file you're loading is partially beause api.jquery.com/load/#script-execution
[19:51:12] <robertmaxrees> but also because it's kinda sloppy
[19:52:05] <robertmaxrees> link that external file somewhere on your page.  lemme know when you've gotten there :)
[19:53:24] <Krantz> like this? https://pastebin.com/Y7BFuB7x
[19:53:43] <robertmaxrees> perfect.
[19:53:53] <robertmaxrees> so wait that UL isn't inside of contenido ?
[19:53:57] <robertmaxrees> so confused haha
[19:54:07] <Krantz> no its not. lemme clear the code
[19:54:19] <robertmaxrees> oh even better.
[19:54:52] <Krantz> https://pastebin.com/3fYMYNWu
[19:55:27] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  so for the next bit, you should really change your nav ul.  right now you have to do a new event binding for each nav link.
[19:55:37] <robertmaxrees> which is kind of inefficient.
[19:56:12] <robertmaxrees> i might do something like https://bpaste.net/show/cf9fc7dd3695 instead.
[19:57:23] <Krantz> ok...and how do I invoke the call?
[19:57:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm about to show you :)
[19:59:31] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/40c7d541a368
[19:59:34] <robertmaxrees> your freebie for the day.
[20:00:12] <robertmaxrees> so basically, we're doing var $contenido = $('#contenido'); so we don't have to keep looking it up - that element itself never gets removed, just its contents, so we store that.
[20:00:55] <robertmaxrees> we then make a function to run the datepicker plugin purely out of convenience.  though that's actually pretty superfluous on second thought.
[20:01:15] <robertmaxrees> so actually https://bpaste.net/show/72677debc7c7
[20:01:54] <robertmaxrees> then we do $('.nav').on('click', '.nav_link', function() { - this basically says "Bind to .nav and listen for any clicks that happen on elements with the class .nav_link
[20:01:58] <robertmaxrees> making sense so far?
[20:03:26] <kr4ntz> this is (at the moment) chinese to me
[20:03:38] <robertmaxrees> hahaha so where did I lose you?
[20:03:39] <robertmaxrees> :)_
[20:04:00] <kr4ntz> the syntax ...$(function() {
[20:04:01] <kr4ntz>  var $contenido = $('#contenido');
[20:04:21] <robertmaxrees> you were using $(function() { before fwiw.
[20:04:24] <kr4ntz> is $ like "void" or something?
[20:04:42] <robertmaxrees> erm, you had that in your code before heh
[20:04:45] <kr4ntz> yea, a product of 2 hours browsing, copying, pasting, and testing
[20:04:45] <robertmaxrees> iot's a document ready.
[20:04:49] <robertmaxrees> aaah.
[20:05:03] <robertmaxrees> it means "run this when the page has triggered the ready state"
[20:06:11] <kr4ntz> ok...
[20:06:43] * kr4ntz reading the code, dechyphering the glyphs
[20:06:54] <robertmaxrees> what next?
[20:07:10] <kr4ntz> all this goes inside my js?
[20:07:21] <robertmaxrees> tghat js file you mean?
[20:07:29] <kr4ntz> (of course only the js, not the html)
[20:07:41] <kr4ntz> the one you told me to create
[20:07:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[20:08:32] <kr4ntz> https://pastebin.com/89uF1Jiu
[20:09:07] <robertmaxrees> yopu don't need those anyu more.
[20:09:08] <kr4ntz> So I remove the code I have and put the one you kindly showed me
[20:09:10] <robertmaxrees> i replaced them
[20:09:12] <robertmaxrees> yep
[20:11:05] <kr4ntz> so. everytime I click a link.... then (From what I can tell) the datepicker function is "appended" to the outer file?
[20:11:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:11:46] <robertmaxrees> so that $.ajax() bit
[20:12:06] <robertmaxrees> that's replacing .load() because all .load() actually does is use .ajax().
[20:12:46] <robertmaxrees> and $.ajax() gives us the ability to use that nifty .then() method.
[20:14:38] <kr4ntz> not working
[20:14:41] <kr4ntz> but I think I know why
[20:15:14] <kr4ntz> you see --- the projects.php (loaded with the LI) inside has another <UL>, which calls yet another project_details.php
[20:15:33] <kr4ntz> index --> projects --> project_details
[20:16:44] <kr4ntz> https://pastebin.com/8piPMcJG
[20:16:56] <kr4ntz> thats the code inside projects.php in charge of calling project_details
[20:16:57] <Knudn> Hi, sorry for interrupting your conversation. But do any of you have any experience with what i posted a couple of minutes ago?
[20:16:57] <Knudn> I've been searching everywhere but can't find anything… would really appreciate any help! :)
[20:20:53] <robertmaxrees> Knudn not the right channel probably?
[20:21:37] <robertmaxrees> kr4ntz so we want to move away from having any inline js entirely
[20:21:59] <robertmaxrees> kr4ntz because otherwise we run some funky risks, like re-binding listeners, whjich we don't want.
[20:22:25] <Knudn> Do you have any advice where i can go Rebertmaxrees? :)
[20:22:54] <robertmaxrees> Knudn what server-side language are you usiing?
[20:25:26] <Knudn> It should be java. I haven't written the software, i only have the software installed.
[20:25:51] <robertmaxrees> Knudn then I'd head to ##java
[20:26:18] <robertmaxrees> wait what software is it?
[20:27:47] <Knudn> It's a software called Safeq, it's a printer management solution.
[20:28:33] <robertmaxrees> in that case i'd reach out to the developer.
[20:28:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, maybe ##java has what you need.
[20:29:05] <robertmaxrees> Knudn out of curiosity, why'd you come here?
[20:31:18] <robertmaxrees> kr4ntz am i making more sense?
[20:31:44] <Knudn> I have actually tried a couple of places :p I figuerd someone in this channel might know the answer :p But thanks for the help! :)
[20:32:22] <robertmaxrees> heh, fwiw you should never store straight passwords in a DB.
[20:33:15] <kr4ntz> yes Robert -- I  understand -- another question: can I create the same .js with different $(function() calls? the reason why I ask is because lilke I said -- the page tree is index --> projects --> project_details --- inside projects there is still another <ul> created dynamically
[20:33:46] <robertmaxrees> kr4ntz you could but there's absolutely no reason to.  they'll execude at the same time.  you actually want to get used to using what are called "delegated ewvent listeners"
[20:34:17] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ for more info
[20:35:58] <kr4ntz> ok - let me understand your code, read and learn more, and If I get stuck again, I'll come back -- thank you so much, Robert -- you rule, man ;)
[20:36:06] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
[20:36:20] <kr4ntz> (y)
[20:59:57] <Violinist> no i rule
