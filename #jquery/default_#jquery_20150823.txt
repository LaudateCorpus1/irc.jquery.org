[01:42:21] <MrRobot_> Hello all
[01:43:47] <MrRobot_> I need to fill data into inputs of dynamically rendered form which is containing various DOM nesting hierarchies. Are there any good libraries or plugins suitable for this case?
[01:45:09] <onr> MrRobot_: you want to populate your forms with dummy data based on input fields' types?
[01:46:03] <MrRobot_> onr yes
[01:46:24] <MrRobot_> onr there are many hidden or fake input elements inside the form
[01:47:18] <onr> honeypots
[01:48:06] <MrRobot_> onr is it any kind of tech term associated with form generation?
[06:05:01] <Kayra> Does anyone have experience using hammer.js with jquery?
[06:26:36] <zanzibizarre> Anyone know how to load json into this Widget:  http://travistidwell.com/jquery.treeselect.js/  ?  Looks like there's a dummy function that's doing recursion.  If someone has an alternative widget that let's me throw a jsbn object at it to AutoLoad, please let me know!
[06:32:59] <Utils> I was hoping someone would tell me why e.dataTransfer is undefined. I'm trying allow files to be dragged and dropped into the grey area: http://jsfiddle.net/5gk6dfpd/ thanks
[06:40:47] <Utils> oh I needed to use originalEvent. never seen that before.
[07:16:19] <rindolf> Hi all.
[07:50:17] <rindolf> Hi all.
[08:21:28] <ribblle> I'm a newbs who's been advised to use phantomjs and nodejs to create a google script. How deep a understanding of js do i need for this?
[08:25:57] <rindolf> ribblle: hi.
[08:26:15] <rindolf> ribblle: I haven't dealt with either.
[08:26:46] <rindolf> ribblle: jQuery is easy, but you need to have some underlying understanding of the underlying DOM and JS model
[08:27:09] <rindolf> ribblle: what is a "Google script"?
[08:27:50] <Uhkis> knowing dom doesnt help with node
[08:33:31] <ribblle> I want to periodically search for specific descriptions and output relevant images
[08:33:51] <ribblle> *very specific, so i shouldn't worry too much about filtering
[08:47:22] <rindolf> ribblle: hi, so use the Google API.
[08:47:46] <rindolf> ribblle: assuming they have one - it may have gone into disarray.
[08:48:07] <rindolf> ribblle: you can use the API in any language that talks HTTP/etc.
[08:48:40] <rindolf> ribblle: or do you intend to do web automation using the browser's UI?
[08:49:34] <jak2000> rindolf!!!! how are you?
[08:50:22] <rindolf> jak2000: I'm fine - been doing some https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy exercises.
[08:51:04] <rindolf> jak2000: are your excalamation marks nutrition? What taste are they? I'm hungry and looking for something to eat.
[08:51:23] <jak2000> i only have 40 liters of beer want?
[08:51:28] <jak2000> i can share
[08:51:39] <rindolf> jak2000: sorry, I don't consume alcoholic beverages.
[08:52:12] <jak2000> mmmm
[08:52:18] <ribblle> i wanted to make a program to do it, but it might be easier to use a browser?
[08:52:36] <rindolf> ribblle: use a browser how?
[08:53:58] <ribblle> I want to periodically search for specific descriptions and output relevant images
[08:54:11] <ribblle> oh sorry, you're the same guy
[08:54:32] <ribblle> you mentioned browsers were an option for web automation
[08:55:24] <rindolf> ribblle: well, you can interface with a browser, but it may be against the Terms-of-Service (ToS).
[08:56:08] <ribblle> best to use a program then
[08:56:45] <ribblle> so use the api with jquery, and learn the basics of DOM and JS?
[08:57:12] <rindolf> ribblle: you don't need jQuery to uset he API.
[08:57:31] <rindolf> ribblle: jQuery is for writing client-side , UI, JS.
[08:57:49] <ribblle> so what will i need
[08:57:53] <PapaSierra> i'm using mocha, karma, phantomjs. i've got the stack working for where i test javascript code in isolation which is great, but now i want to test my code which includes some dom manipulation. for that i'll need an html host page and then i'll run my tests in that context. how do i do this?
[08:58:35] <rindolf> ribblle: an HTTP library and an XML and/or JSON parsers.
[08:58:49] <feodoran> hi, I am just getting started with jquery, can someone help me out with this? https://jsfiddle.net/x4Lwpft6/
[08:59:08] <rindolf> feodoran: hi , let me see.
[08:59:37] <ribblle> where can i find or make those?
[09:00:07] <rindolf> feodoran: your markup is off.
[09:00:45] <rindolf> feodoran: it may actually validate as HTML 5 (given how much braindamaged it is) but it is not strictly correct.
[09:01:14] <rindolf> feodoran: you may need to wrap everything in a $(function() { ... })
[09:01:18] <feodoran> rindolf: does it have to be html5?
[09:01:37] <ribblle> Do you know any other ircs i can to go to for advice?
[09:02:25] <rindolf> feodoran: no  , it does not.
[09:02:41] <rindolf> ribblle: any other IRC channels/chat-rooms?
[09:02:49] <ribblle> yep
[09:03:11] <rindolf> ribblle: there are quite a few including ##programming
[09:03:24] <ribblle> ty
[09:03:36] <ribblle> any u recommend?
[09:03:50] <rindolf> feodoran: fixed it - https://jsfiddle.net/gkmujpL2/
[09:04:37] <feodoran> rindolf: thx
[09:04:46] <rindolf> feodoran: you're welcome .
[09:05:11] <fas3r> hello
[09:05:41] <fas3r> is it possible to use data- on with the archor ?

[09:06:34] <rindolf> fas3r: do you mean the anchor?
[09:06:48] <fas3r> yes.
[09:22:00] <feodoran> why does $(this).text() (for <select ...>) give my a list of all entries, instead of just the selected one? https://jsfiddle.net/gkmujpL2/
[09:22:31] <rindolf> feodoran: let me see.
[09:23:43] <rindolf> feodoran: what do you mean by that?
[09:23:55] <rindolf> feodoran: i see a drop-down combobox there.
[09:24:31] <feodoran> if I change it, the alert shows me "One\nTwo" (with \n being a linebreak)
[09:25:01] <rindolf> feodoran: the alert shows 1 here.
[09:25:09] <feodoran> really?
[09:25:19] <rindolf> feodoran: yes, and 2.
[09:25:27] <rindolf> feodoran: firefox-40.0 for x86-64 linux.
[09:26:12] <feodoran> hm...the code was not updated: https://jsfiddle.net/gkmujpL2/1/
[09:27:05] <feodoran> basically, I want to get the "One" instead of "1"
[09:27:27] <rindolf> feodoran: well, .text() returns the context of the whole <select /> - not only the <option />s
[09:29:19] <feodoran> I guess, my source is wrong then. How do I get the text for the selected entry only?
[09:30:38] <fr4nk> lert($(this).find(':selected').text());
[09:30:40] <fr4nk> alert*
[09:31:23] <feodoran> thx
[09:31:57] <rindolf> fr4nk: thanks!

[09:33:12] <rindolf> # Free karma for a free world.
[09:34:07] <rindolf> feodoran: i strongly recommend assigning from "this" to a lexical variable, because "this" can get clobbered easily.
[09:34:26] <rindolf> Some people do var that = this;
[09:41:05] <feodoran> rindolf: what exactly do you mean be "clobbered easily"?
[09:41:28] <rindolf> feodoran: like become something else you don't want.
[09:42:10] <feodoran> with the function triggered by "this"?
[09:42:15] <feodoran> *within
[09:43:46] <rindolf> feodoran: in general.
[09:44:02] <rindolf> feodoran: it may not mean what you think it means.
[09:46:43] <feodoran> rindolf: do you maybe know a website or something explaining this in more detail?
[09:47:47] <rindolf> feodoran: not off hand - I Saw the "var that = this;" advice in a Stack Overflow thread from what i recall.
[09:50:42] <feodoran> rindolf: do you mean what is explained here? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4886632/what-does-var-that-this-mean-in-javascript
[09:51:30] <rindolf> feodoran: don't remember.
[10:07:25] <amirite> macintosh is for faggots and homos
[10:07:29] <amirite> who agrees
[10:21:28] <rindolf> amirite: hi.
[10:21:40] <rindolf> amirite: please don't be homophobic.
[10:24:20] <rindolf> amirite: I don't use Macintosh/etc. due to it being proprietary (and Apple being a particularly nasty company and now a Messiah-less one), but its association with females or gay men, is not too founded.
[10:26:08] <rindolf> I have a better joke about it, but I'd rather not share it now.
[11:05:19] <djam90> Hi I wondered if someone could help me. I have written some working code that finds the tallest element out of a set of elements, and then sets the other elements to be the same height. However, the way I do this seems quite over-complicated. Also I want to make it reusable so I can trigger it at a later time (when new items are added/removed I want all columns to be the height of the tallest one) https://jsbin.com/veyevegabi/edit?js
[11:07:38] <rindolf> djam90: it looks fine to me.
[11:07:58] <djam90> rindolf, finding the max height out of all containers... isn't there something like reduce() I can use?
[11:07:58] <rindolf> djam90: do you need the itemIndex though?
[11:08:16] <djam90> rindolf not really I thought i might later on but turns out i didnt
[11:08:16] <rindolf> djam90: there should be, but it may not be worth it.
[11:10:58] <rindolf> djam90: there may be a max function and a map one/etc.
[11:11:18] <djam90> ah I see
[11:16:57] <rindolf> djam90: not sure it's really worth it.
[11:18:54] <h2m> can anyone help for jquery question ?
[11:19:54] <Kamuela> does a jquery post have kind of like a "pending" promise of sorts? something that i could string onto the call that would do something while waiting for response?

[11:26:19] <h2sm> rindolf: but I want to wrap only every part of the text in span, wrap is not the solution
[11:28:42] <h2m> Uhkis : It's not resolving my problem :/
[11:29:20] <Uhkis> h2m make a fiddle
[11:29:24] <Uhkis> ?demo
[11:29:24] <b-ot> Uhkis: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:30:00] <Kamuela> or i suppose what i could do is just do the UI change after the call code and then the return code can change UI again
[11:34:45] <h2m> Uhkis : http://jsfiddle.net/oyrw0gqh/ I can't resolve my problem :/
[11:38:15] <h2m> Unkis: I do update to precise my problem : http://jsfiddle.net/oyrw0gqh/1/

[21:48:26] <onr> welcome to #jquery
[21:50:09] <totallyquiche> I just posted this in ##php, but same question to you fine folk: Can anyone tell me a good place to go to discuss programming/jQuery with others who are new to it? I've done a lot on my own, but have never been in a peer environment and would like to speak with others "at my level" so-to-speak.
[22:07:02] <Zeranoe> How can I force an image to reload, if the cached version is over an hour old?
[22:08:27] <totallyquiche> This looks promising (not tested): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2104949/how-to-reload-refresh-an-elementimage-in-jquery
[22:08:39] <totallyquiche> d = new Date(); $("#myimg").attr("src", "/myimg.jpg?"+d.getTime());
[22:09:25] <totallyquiche> Actually similar to how I got around an issue with needing to refresh a page after changing only the hash value in the URL
[22:10:53] <Zeranoe> That's pretty elegant. Will most modern browsers redownload an image if it detects a different src?
[22:12:23] <nodist> They update elements on the fly so I would assume so
[22:13:51] <totallyquiche> AFAIK the src value is the only thing browsers use for caching generally

[23:02:31] <dimi1947> I
[23:02:47] <dimi1947> I cannot make jquery validate to work...https://jsfiddle.net/e60v32fm/2/
[23:05:52] <Max-P> dimi1947: jQuery doesn't have a .validate() function.
[23:06:37] <Max-P> Ah I see, you include the plugin
[23:06:43] <dimi1947> jjuqery does not have such a function but jquery validate does
[23:06:53] <Max-P> "Mixed Content: The page at 'https://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.validation/1.14.0/jquery.validate.min.js'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS."
[23:07:50] <dimi1947> how I can server the plugin with https...the plugin page does not offer such links
[23:08:34] <Max-P> dimi1947: Adding an S works, so just use this: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.validation/1.14.0/jquery.validate.min.js
[23:08:52] <Max-P> It appears the plugin works using that URL
[23:09:26] <dimi1947> it still does not work
[23:09:47] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/e60v32fm/4/
[23:31:41] <Cork> dimi1947: click will fire before the validator
[23:32:11] <Cork> dimi1947: you don't ever want to bind click preventDefault on submit buttons
[23:34:16] <dimi1947> it still does not work....yes but if I do not put event.preventdefault JS code will not run
[23:34:33] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/e60v32fm/11/
[23:35:22] <Cork> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/e60v32fm/12/
[23:35:24] <Cork> works fine here
[23:36:54] <Cork> dimi1947: also if you want the callback to only fire if it is valid => https://jsfiddle.net/e60v32fm/13/
[23:37:04] <dimi1947> I allways used preventDefault on submit buttons...and it is a wrong practice?
[23:37:15] <Cork> yes
[23:37:22] <Cork> click isn't a submit event
[23:38:14] <dimi1947> ok 1 last q....how am I going to run the server-side code?
[23:38:23] <dimi1947> server-side validation
[23:38:34] <nodist> what language?
[23:38:42] <dimi1947> php
[23:39:21] <Cork> dimi1947: http://jqueryvalidation.org/remote-method/
[23:39:26] <dimi1947> I suppose if JS is disabled...prevent default will not work
[23:39:32] <Cork> ya
[23:39:44] <Cork> that part should always run even if you have js validation
[23:39:50] <Cork> ya==ah
[23:40:12] <Cork> javascript validation is to make the visual effect nicer
[23:40:14] <Cork> not security
[23:40:26] <dimi1947> yes I understand....
[23:40:27] <Cork> server side should ALWAYS validate for integrity/secutiry
[23:40:52] <dimi1947> yes...but when server-side validation runs....after clicking the submit button?
[23:41:09] <Cork> server side doesn't know/care about js
[23:41:21] <Cork> when you get a post from client side, validate all the data
[23:41:26] <Cork> if it isn't valid, show an error page
[23:41:54] <dimi1947> yes...when that POST hapens..after what action?
[23:42:08] <Cork> uh
[23:42:15] <Elyx0> (didnt get it either)
[23:42:20] <Cork> it isn't related to an action
[23:42:29] <dimi1947> after clicking the submit button?
[23:42:33] <Cork> when a http post stream comes in server side
[23:42:34] <Elyx0> It's just good practice :o
[23:42:38] <Cork> even if it is from wget or what ever
[23:42:45] <Cork> you should validate the data before doing anything
[23:43:00] <Cork> it should NOT be requested separately by js
[23:45:33] <Cork> it isn't actually just good practice it is vital if you want any security around the data
[23:47:26] <Elyx0> It's because of you Cork that we can't have fun with XSS anymore :'(
[23:47:37] <Cork> lol
[23:47:57] <dimi1947> I was not clear....I will make some  tests first and come back if the need arises
