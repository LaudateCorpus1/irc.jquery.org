[00:45:19] <Sagar>  i have divs like this, http://prntscr.com/fd92no i want to make them rotatable via TOUCH event like a spinning wheel and get the value of the CIRCLE when it's in front of CHERVRON SELECTORS
[01:29:08] <iateadonut> i want to use $(this) within $.ajax().done(function() { ... }) - how do i put it in there?
[01:30:18] <iateadonut> this seems to work:  checkbox = $(this);  and then use 'checkbox' after that
[02:10:17] <Cork> iateadonut: ya, that is the solution, optionally you can do $.ajax(url, { context: this }).done(function() { $(this) })
[02:27:35] <nights> hm
[02:27:48] <nights> any simple way to replace $(function() with a wrapper function ?

[09:18:34] <txithihausen> Hi fellows, i'm dealing with a doubt about the use of toggle function combined with 'next' function. I have a set of checkboxes where for each checkbox I have the label and a upload file button. I want to toggle the file button and boldering the label through the following code => https://pastebin.com/9Lj4ua1A
[09:18:59] <txithihausen> The label goes to bold as expected but the file button does not toggle. Any tip?
[09:38:32] <Cork> txithihausen: i would strongly recommend using classes instead of putting the styling info in js
[09:38:51] <Cork> that would actually be able to make this js free
[09:39:44] <txithihausen> Cork, thank you. I'll fix it. Nevertheless, this specific point is working; The actually problem is related to the upload button. Do you have any idea what is wrong?
[09:40:01] <Cork> txithihausen: secondly you should use a label not a span for the checkbox
[09:40:57] <Cork> the reason for that is that means you can click the text to toggle the checkbox
[09:41:01] <Cork> not just the checkbox image
[09:42:56] <txithihausen> Cork, I get it! Thanks for the advice! :)
[09:43:12] <Cork> txithihausen: give me a min and i'll provide you an example
[09:45:21] <Cork> txithihausen: https://jsfiddle.net/du46vLcx/
[09:46:42] <txithihausen> Cork, thank you very much for your attention!
[09:46:49] <Cork> np

[13:27:01] <GeekMonkey> Has anyone used the googleapi to list all the reviews
[13:27:25] <GeekMonkey> I a trying to figure out what the to put in for the account name and the location name
[13:43:41] <GeekMonkey> anyone here?
[13:43:53] <taplar> sure
[13:44:31] <GeekMonkey> taplar trying to work with this https://mybusiness.googleapis.com/v3/accounts/account_name/locations/location_name/reviews
[13:44:48] <taplar> yeah, i saw your question.  i just don't know anything about it
[14:01:17] <GeekMonkey> taplar have you seen a google plugin that allows you to show total ammount of reviews or the star rating?
[14:01:54] <taplar> i haven't really dealt with the googs much.  only browsing analytic results
[14:28:33] <Kr4ntz> Hello all - Quick question: I have an input (filled from php with the URL of an image). I want to be able to 1) get the image the URL reffers to inside an empty img, and also if the user types another image URL, go get the new image using Jquery. I think the solution lies within $.ajax but I'm still not experienced enough to solve this on my own. p
[14:28:33] <Kr4ntz> lease help.
[14:29:10] <taplar> you want to show the image that is referenced by the url?
[14:30:17] <Kr4ntz> Taplar: yes - when user selects the record, the input will be filled with the "current" image URL -- but that input can be edited by the user, so he can put another URL... I want to get the initial image (when the record is loaded) and then get the new image the user could type in
[14:30:40] <taplar> that wouldn't be ajax, really.  you'd just grab the url and put it on the src of an img
[14:31:05] <Kr4ntz> If I put the img src, will it inmediately display the new image
[14:31:10] <Kr4ntz> ?
[14:31:12] <taplar> yep
[14:31:24] <taplar> once retrieved by the browser, as normal
[14:31:39] <Kr4ntz> how about when the user types the new image URL?
[14:31:54] <taplar> you'd just have to grab the new value and repeat the process
[14:32:46] <Kr4ntz> exactly - so if the user types a new img url, I should use Jquery to go get it and put it in the img src, right?
[14:32:57] <taplar> sure
[14:33:15] <Kr4ntz> ok -- how do I do that?
[14:33:41] <taplar> var newUrl = $(selectorForTheInput).val();
[14:33:58] <taplar> $(selectorForTheImgElement).attr('src', newUrl)
[14:34:24] <Kr4ntz> that simple? wow! thanks! :)
[14:34:55] <Kr4ntz> I really appreciate your answer, Taplar -- thanks a lot
[14:35:00] <taplar> np
[15:45:21] <GeekMonkey> In this example it shows the map details inside the map popup
[15:45:22] <GeekMonkey> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/place-details
[15:45:34] <GeekMonkey> how would I show it just inside a div without the map
[15:46:23] <taplar> why are you asking this in #jquery?
[15:47:00] <GeekMonkey> it's javascript?
[15:47:06] <GeekMonkey> where else can I ask?
[15:47:09] <taplar> if anything.  it's not jquery
[21:55:05] <tachy0n> http://cinemacloud.co/prospectus/  <- can someone tell me why disabling enter press isn't working here? I've tried everything I could find on stackoverflow
