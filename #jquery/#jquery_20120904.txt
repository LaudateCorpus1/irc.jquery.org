[00:19:41] <EasyCo> Enlighten me please, trying to bind an event to something added to the dom after script execution: http://jsfiddle.net/DurrW/
[00:20:08] <NodeX> use on()
[00:20:40] <EasyCo> Did you check the code snippet?
[00:20:42] <EasyCo> I am
[00:20:52] <NodeX> example ... $('body').on('some-event','class',function(event){.........});
[00:21:00] <NodeX> not in the correct way you are not
[00:23:22] <NodeX> you're welcome
[00:23:23] <EasyCo> Ok
[00:23:33] <EasyCo> Haha, easy tiger, just trying it.
[00:23:38] <EasyCo> But, yes thanks
[00:23:42] <NodeX> easy tiger?
[00:24:05] <EasyCo> nm
[00:29:06] <EasyCo> Worked nicely, thanks.
[00:32:54] <smatt> Could some one give me a little advice on correct way to go about this (don't need code, just the logic) - user arrives on the page, and with a drop down can submit 1-4 (default of 1) items. Each item has an identical form. They can only access the number of forms they select from the drop down. Initially I was adding a new tab and cloning the first form to create the right amount, but it's making managing the IDs and the various bits of JS that act on the for
[00:32:54] <smatt> quite convoluted. Thoughts of a more elegant way of doing it?
[00:33:24] <smatt> Now leaning towards having all 4 forms exist with correct IDs etc, having the 4 tabs exist but only enabling the number of tabs corresponding to the first drop down.
[00:36:08] <masak> smatt: have you taken a look at knockoutjs?
[00:36:45] <smatt> Can't say that I have
[00:38:35] <spots> hi
[00:39:39] <smatt> masak: looks interesting, thanks
[00:39:50] <spots> how can i make draggables work with tablets?
[00:52:12] <syntax> Is seems that html defined actions "<input id="n1" type="button">" are not fired by jQuery once we call $("input#n1").click();
[00:52:39] <syntax> wtf?
[00:53:31] <systemfault> What is the defined action for a button?
[00:53:58] <syntax> button?
[00:54:06] <xdjuj_> input type button ?
[00:54:11] <xdjuj_> What's that ?
[00:54:17] <xdjuj_> input type submit
[00:54:19] <xdjuj_> or button
[00:54:24] <xdjuj_> But what is input type button ?
[00:54:25] <systemfault> What do you expect to happen when you click on a input type="button" ?
[00:54:52] <syntax> change the source attr of an img
[00:55:03] <granden_> If I have a div with width:100% could I retrive the pixels with that the browsers has rendered it?
[00:55:08] <syntax> $("input#a1").click(function() {$('img#pov').src = 'img/image.jpg';});
[00:55:14] <ravenzz> this maybe http://clientsfromhell.net/post/30403644139/me-are-there-any-special-features-youd-like
[00:55:52] <systemfault> syntax: Ahhh, It's your "html defined actions" that confused me.
[00:57:11] <syntax> dunno why but it wont fire the function
[00:57:45] <systemfault> syntax: It works with that stupid test http://jsfiddle.net/8Ljqc/
[01:00:24] <mvk> i got a big fat page with some controls that trigger AJAX, ie. when a radiobutton is selected, communication might occur to define some logic on the page
[01:00:58] <mvk> when ajax is communicating, i would like the next INPUT[TYPE=SUBMIT] to have a different background image
[01:01:30] <mvk> so in my AjaxCommunicating(){   //how do i find the next submit button on the page here? }
[01:04:40] <EoN> hey guys. has anyone here used jquery mobile with much success? i'm trying to choose a cross platform development environment for an app. i know this questoin gets asked all the time, but still yet to find a standout answer
[01:08:04] <mvk> how do i use nextAll or nextUntil to find a element up the domtree,
[01:09:09] <mvk> it doesnt give me a the element im expecting
[01:10:22] <systemfault> mvk: The description of your problem is awful.. that's probably why you don't get help.
[01:10:31] <mvk> hHAHAHHAHAHAAH
[01:10:59] <mvk> im trying to store the id of the element that fired my ajax.. > lastUsedBusyObjectId = $("#" + args._postBackElement.id).nextAll("input[type=submit]").first().attr('id');
[01:11:19] <mvk> args._postBackElement.id is a ASP.NET Ajax Toolkit thing
[01:11:30] <mvk> its just the id of the element that is causing communication to happen
[01:11:49] <Eviltwin> Without knowing your HTML structure it's hard to see why that selector isn't working
[01:11:58] <mvk> i would like to 'catch' the id of the next button on the page
[01:12:02] <Eviltwin> Can you make a pastebin with a sample of your HTML including at least two consecutive forms
[01:12:08] <granden_> How could I detect broweser resizing live?
[01:12:10] <systemfault> mvk: Isn't args._postBackElement the submit button?
[01:12:21] <Eviltwin> granden_: see ?.resize
[01:12:21] <bot-t> granden_, .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[01:12:32] <gianiaz> hi
[01:12:39] <mvk> it can be either a radiobutton or a button, its just the id of the element that caused the ajax to fire
[01:12:48] <systemfault> Hmm
[01:13:02] <gianiaz> I'm waiting for jquery 1.9 to use this one: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip, in the meanwhile, do you know any plugin similar to this?
[01:13:06] <granden_> Eviltwin: Thanks exactly what I'm looking for.
[01:13:33] <systemfault> mvk: Perhaps you could do something like $("#" + args._postBackElement.id).closest('form').find('input[type="submit"]')
[01:13:37] <Eviltwin> mvk: What about something like $("#"+args._postBackElement.id).closest("form").find("input[type=submit]").first().attr('id')
[01:13:42] <Eviltwin> Wow
[01:13:42] <systemfault> :)
[01:13:44] <Eviltwin> Yes
[01:13:54] <systemfault> Eviltwin: Yours was more complete so you win
[01:14:38] <EoN> is jquery touch better than phonegap?
[01:15:17] <systemfault> I wish I knew… I should try to do mobile apps..
[01:15:45] <systemfault> Seems that native apps is still the way to go though..
[01:17:58] <mvk> thanks guys systemfault Eviltwin > for me to understand it right, .closest("form").find .. will this cause jquery to search UP the dom tree
[01:18:00] <mvk> not down?
[01:18:26] <systemfault> Right
[01:18:30] <gianiaz> EoN, phonegap and jqtouch are 2 different things
[01:18:36] <Eviltwin> mvk: .closest is up, .find is down
[01:19:00] <EoN> gianiaz: i know, that's why i was asking if one is better than the other?
[01:19:03] <Eviltwin> mvk: The combo goes up to the closest <form> tag then down to the input[type=submit] tags
[01:19:49] <mvk> i can i search from button to top?
[01:20:09] <mvk> let me guess: furtest?
[01:20:38] <Eviltwin> I don't understand what you mean by that
[01:21:28] <mvk> it starts at (opening tag) <form> , the tries to find the first button
[01:21:37] <mvk> i would like it to start at </form> :D
[01:21:59] <mvk> farthest
[01:22:00] <Eviltwin> It operates on the DOM, not the HTML
[01:22:02] <systemfault> mvk: Stop thinking in terms of HTML
[01:22:05] <Eviltwin> Do you know what the DOM is?
[01:22:11] <mvk> document object model
[01:22:16] <mvk> i know the dom-tree
[01:22:20] <gianiaz> EoN, they are different, they do different jobs... phonegap is a javascript layer between you and the phone, it permits to use javascript for creating web app or it permits for example to access to camera, gps ecc. Jqtouch is a library, but only a javascript library
[01:22:29] <Eviltwin> Okay, .closest() searches up the DOM TREE
[01:22:32] <Eviltwin> Do you know what that means?
[01:22:50] <Eviltwin> And given that why "furthest" doesn't make any sense
[01:23:08] <mvk> thing is, i have multiple buttons
[01:23:20] <Eviltwin> Inside the same form?
[01:23:28] <mvk> Eviltwin: yes
[01:23:32] <systemfault> Design problem…?
[01:23:38] <EoN> gianiaz: so if i want to write a fairly straight forward app (not a game) which has standard minimal data retrieval/saving, and i want to 'write once, deploy anywhere', do you have a recommendation?
[01:23:42] <mvk> no, its a development button ... 'prefill' form
[01:24:25] <mvk> i think i know what i want.... instead of: $("#" + args._postBackElement.id).fartest("form").find("input[type=submit]").first().attr('id');
[01:24:31] <mvk> $("#" + args._postBackElement.id).fartest("form").find("input[type=submit]").LAST().attr('id');
[01:25:03] <Eviltwin> see ?.last
[01:25:03] <bot-t> .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[01:25:31] <gianiaz> EoN, I've tried only phonegap, but I think your question should be, it's better, phonegap, Appcelerator or Ansca Mobile?
[01:25:59] <mvk> thanks guys!
[01:26:37] <gianiaz> then, when you've choosen the phone framework you can use on top of this jquerymobile, sencha or jqtouch (or any other library)
[01:27:28] <EoN> gianiaz: if you were doing a new project now, what woudl you use?
[01:28:38] <gianiaz> EoN, phonegap cause I've a little experience, there's a big community around it, but as I said I don't have experience with other frameworks
[01:29:11] <gianiaz> I don't know if it is a good think, but I think phonegap was acquired by adobe recently
[01:32:32] <ravenzz> EoN usually you don't need the 90% of the framework
[01:32:58] <ravenzz> you would ask yourself whether you actually need one or not
[01:34:01] <EoN> well if you want it to be compilable into an "app", you need a framework, right?
[01:34:02] <ravenzz> In most cases the answer is NO, but I am too lazy
[01:34:11] <ravenzz> no you don't
[01:34:19] <ravenzz> need jQuery mobile for instance
[01:40:14] <gianiaz> I want to show a tooltip with an arrow near an element when the user do something, do you know a good plugin? I'm watching jqtooltip but it seems that it show the bubble only when you hover an element...
[01:53:50] <smatt> Could some one give me a little advice on correct way to go about this (don't need code, just the logic) - user arrives on the page, and with a drop down can submit 1-4 (default of 1) items.

[01:54:11] <smatt> Asked this earlier but curious to get more input as there's quite a few options of how to go about doing it.
[02:02:04] <sulaiman> Hello
[02:03:12] <radiodario> morning
[02:03:17] <sulaiman> I want to toggle between the following two classes "btn btn-red" and "btn btn-green", can toggleClass work with such a case, where two classes are used separated by space?
[02:03:54] <sulaiman> atm, I am only using toggleClass('btn-red btn-green')
[02:23:38] <mbn_18> Hi, this does not work for me. Any ide why? $('input').change(function() { alert('Hi'); });
[02:23:51] <mbn_18> Nothing happen when I click in an <input>
[02:24:25] <mbn_18> Also tried $("input").on("change", function(event){ alert('Hi'); });
[02:26:06] <Trisox> well it only works when your change the value..?
[02:26:31] <Trisox> clicking doesnt change the value of the input.. by standard
[02:27:12] <mbn_18> Trisox: Yea, I put the cursor and click few chars
[02:27:44] <Trisox> click ? or type?
[02:28:42] <xec_> mbn_18: iirc change only fires when it loses focus (and has changed)
[02:29:24] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/dtUE5/
[02:29:27] <Trisox> indeed
[02:29:28] <mbn_18> xec_: Yea, this seems to be the problem. Is there other event to fire up on any change? without focus?
[02:29:29] <Trisox> else keyup
[02:29:36] <xec_> mbn_18: keypress
[02:29:45] <xec_> or keyup, or keydown
[02:29:53] <topriddy> hello good people, how do i set the value of an element in code, and still ensure it fires a change, that i may probably have a call back to when its done?
[02:29:55] <mbn_18> Thanks
[02:30:32] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/dtUE5/1/
[02:30:33] <topriddy> the case here is of two select box A and B. when A changes B loads. but this time around I want to edit a user who already has a value for A and B which i should set from code
[02:30:33] <Trisox> there
[02:30:37] <topriddy> ?
[02:30:40] <Trisox> mbn_18: http://jsfiddle.net/dtUE5/1/
[02:30:44] <topriddy> hint anyone
[02:31:54] <mbn_18> Trisox: nice, what is the diffrence between keyup and keypress?
[02:33:09] <blackspotwiggins> mbn_18, keyup happens when you lift your finger off the key
[02:33:19] <blackspotwiggins> between keydown and keyup there can be many keypresses
[02:33:22] <blackspotwiggins> as it repeats
[02:33:48] <topriddy> please is my question unclear?
[02:33:49] <blackspotwiggins> practically, depending on the browser you can get the ascii code or the physical button code
[02:34:05] <mbn_18> blackspotwiggins: thx
[02:34:11] <blackspotwiggins> topriddy, .change()
[02:34:13] <xec_> mbn_18: keyup fires when the user releases (any) key (like shift etc) while keypress fires whenever a new character is entered (even if you hold a key down)
[02:34:31] <Trisox> what blackspotwiggins sayd
[02:34:44] <Trisox> said
[02:34:53] <mbn_18> xec_: Also long press? insert same char many times?
[02:35:16] <xec_> mbn_18: right. keypress will fire for each character while keyup will only happen once after you release the key
[02:35:44] <mbn_18> Great, thanks!
[02:36:24] <xec_> pressing shift or arrow keys will not fire the keypress event
[02:36:34] <xec_> iirc
[02:38:44] <blackspotwiggins> depending on browser
[02:39:11] <blackspotwiggins> it should iirc
[02:39:56] <blackspotwiggins> xec_, xec, http://unixpapa.com/js/testkey.html
[02:47:40] <topriddy> blackspotwiggins: i mean i want to change a select option from code, fire a change/ajax on server, and also have an handle to callback method
[02:47:57] <xec_> right, so modifier keys does not fire keypress, but the arrow keys do
[02:50:29] <topriddy> i want to fire a jquery change event from code.
[02:57:04] <ura> hi
[02:58:02] <ura> Is it portable to access DOM attributes directly, like elt.id or link.href, rather then $(elt).attr('id') $(link).attr('href')?
[02:58:30] <systemfault> Yes, no problem with that
[02:59:02] <systemfault> But there's a difference between an attribute and a property
[02:59:15] <ura> systemfault, thanks!
[02:59:18] <systemfault> .attr and .prop don't do the same thing
[02:59:18] <b-ot> systemfault, just that
[03:00:04] <ura> thanks, I'm aware that DOM attribute does not correspond all HTML attributes
[03:00:06] <systemfault> I mean, elt.id will access the property…. not the attribute
[03:00:10] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[03:00:53] <marchelly> hi,  I want to add question mark (little ? image, clicking on what would bring some text and click one more time would hide it), how does this name to find it with google, it's like suggestions you can clic on most registration forms, etc
[03:01:20] <marchelly> I found this one on some website but i doesn't know how to use it http://pastebin.com/zfhzy7Ax I mean I can insert image in html but how to make this popup.
[03:01:25] <marchelly> thanks
[03:06:30] <sinclair> hi everyone
[03:08:34] <topriddy> what happens if you change the value of a select option from code? does it fire the change() you wrote?
[03:08:52] <beasty> hi guys
[03:08:55] <beasty> i have a question
[03:09:15] <beasty> i have a bunch of $().change() stuff going on
[03:09:36] <beasty> but the elements are inside a accordeon stuff
[03:09:45] <beasty> but for some reason they aren't executed
[03:09:47] <beasty> any idea ,
[03:10:07] <majd> Hey #jquery - i'm completely baffled by this error: i have code similar to this on my page: http://jsfiddle.net/hB8tV/
[03:10:34] <majd> but for some reason, the first input field comes up always empty
[03:10:45] <systemfault> majd: What is the error? What browser?
[03:10:56] <majd> this only happens with IE8
[03:11:20] <majd> ff, chrome, it works just fine
[03:11:22] <systemfault> Perhaps it's because you use for/in to iterate on arrays
[03:11:30] <systemfault> Which is bad..
[03:12:10] <majd> systemfault: how should i iterate over an array?
[03:12:26] <systemfault> Either a normal for loop or $.each
[03:12:26] <majd> i know .each(), but that iterates over a jquery array...
[03:12:47] <systemfault> $.each(myArray, function() { var element = this; });
[03:12:49] <majd> systemfault: why is using for to iterate over an array bad, btw?
[03:13:39] <systemfault> majd: Because on older implementation, it might iterate on all members (.length included)… and also, it might not iterate on the element in order
[03:14:02] <majd> oh wow...
[03:14:23] <systemfault> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in Read the beige/yellow blocks if you want more info https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in
[03:14:31] <systemfault> Err sorry for the double paste

[03:16:24] <systemfault> You're welcome
[03:17:32] <xnotte> i have a <div id="marcacaoTop"></div> and in a click event (and on firebug console too) this does nothing, doesnt create the anchor    $("#marcacaoTop").add("<a href='x'> X </a>");
[03:18:09] <systemfault> .add?
[03:18:21] <systemfault> Do you mean .append ?
[03:18:32] <xnotte> i thought it was .add to do that
[03:18:50] <xnotte> add its for li, p, etc right ?
[03:18:51] <systemfault> Nah, .add is to add a node to a jquery object

[03:58:34] <n_np> can somebody please help me?
[03:58:39] <Rochefort> hi, i'm using lavalamp in my site but not working
[03:58:41] <Rochefort> its my codes: http://jsfiddle.net/thVjc/3/
[03:58:46] <Rochefort> how can i fix it?
[03:59:54] <n_np> i need help too, quite urgently
[04:03:18] <mark-> how can i group a bunch of selectors into a variable? var Selectset1 $('#one, #two, #three');  ?
[04:04:07] <sinclair> i'm trying to slideDown a div in a table row and it works nicely but when the row is "empty" it takes up an amount of space and it looks really bad... anyone have any suggestions/clues?
[04:04:09] <jeffreydev> @Rochefort, your li.back element isn't inside the ul perhaps your error has something to do with this?
[04:05:06] <Rochefort> jeffreydev: one min.
[04:05:09] <Rochefort> wrong link
[04:05:38] <jeffreydev> seemed like you initialized the lavalamp on the surounding div instead of the ul
[04:06:14] <mark-> essentially, want to save a set of selectors in a variable - whats the best way to do that?
[04:06:39] <Rochefort> jeffreydev:  thats true link http://jsfiddle.net/Rochefort/QzXNv/
[04:07:26] <n_np> does anyone have any experience with smart wizard?
[04:08:32] <sahbeewah> n_np: post some code if you want some help
[04:09:08] <sahbeewah> mark-: yeah you can combine selectors like that - $('selector1, selector2, ...')
[04:09:32] <n_np> ok
[04:10:14] <n_np> its 2000 lines
[04:10:18] <n_np> i dont know which part to post
[04:10:22] <n_np> any suggestions?
[04:10:28] <n_np> what about the outputted html?
[04:12:15] <n_np> sahbeewah here is the jquery part http://pastebin.com/EwLpPtWU
[04:12:22] <n_np> i think the problem is in the onfinishcallback
[04:14:14] <jeffreydev> Rochefort: http://jsfiddle.net/QzXNv/1/
[04:14:42] <jeffreydev> don't use .lavalamp() on the anchor but on the ul element
[04:14:46] <Rochefort> jeffreydev: big thanks but i want border-bottom
[04:14:51] <Rochefort> how can i change?
[04:15:13] <jeffreydev> instead of background color in css just add a border to the bottom
[04:15:45] <sahbeewah> n_np, what the heck is that
[04:15:45] <jeffreydev> http://jsfiddle.net/QzXNv/2/

[04:16:44] <pangelovski> hi guys, is it possible to get an object by id and type?
[04:17:07] <Spikes> what do you mean by type?
[04:17:25] <Spikes> pangelovski, still, i'd say yes
[04:17:45] <sahbeewah> n_np: use the console and look out for any error messages
[04:18:00] <pangelovski> well i have a page and a href link with the same id(complex reasons) and when i do var page = $('#' + id) i get the link instead of the page back
[04:18:09] <n_np> sahbeewah how do you do that?
[04:18:27] <pangelovski> Spikes: so what i need to do is return the page based on the id
[04:18:31] <sahbeewah> n_np, what browser are you using?
[04:19:40] <Spikes> pangelovski, it's a bad idea to have id assigned to several objects in the first place, what's the page element name (div?)
[04:19:58] <kborchers> pangelovski: what ever the reason, you should not have any elements sharing an id. that is invalid and no matter what you do with your selector, you will probably have inconsistent results
[04:20:07] <Spikes> pangelovski, presumably: var page = $('div#' + id);
[04:20:46] <pangelovski> ok, i guess i need to rename all of the. its just that i am using the element id as a parameter, but i guess i just need to do some string manipulation before sending in as a param
[04:20:54] <n_np> aaaaah ty sahbeewah
[04:21:27] <Spikes> pangelovski, k, i don't know your situation, so do what you think is right
[04:21:43] <pangelovski> Spikes: Thanks though
[04:23:59] <Spikes> pangelovski, no problem, good luck
[04:24:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone knows a good plugin or something for styling tables?
[04:41:12] <sinclair> how do i change the table row height so it doesn't show when the div is hidden before slideDown?
[04:43:16] <sinclair> it was the td padding! =)
[04:43:19] <sinclair> great
[04:45:31] <phpboss> Anyone here that can help me with a path problem?
[04:46:34] <Spikes> Just ask
[04:46:44] <phpboss> Thanks
[04:48:43] <phpboss>  I have a problem using path to create an arc effect for a gallery. The thumbs are in a container div for styling purposes and the thumb needs to expand as it moves into the div holding the theader
[04:49:38] <phpboss> I can post the sample code here or put it on my server for antone to see?
[04:49:39] <gianiaz> please, can you help me with this selection problem? http://jsbin.com/idebec/3/edit
[04:50:05] <Spikes> phpboss, jsfiddle or server, cause right now i have hard time understanding
[04:50:39] <phpboss> k give me just a minute
[04:51:30] <Spikes> k
[04:51:36] <s0u][ight> assume there are several divs with class="menu-item", each one also has a img inside, second child all the time. What jquery selector would select this?
[04:53:46] <phpboss> http://www.munchieedesigns.com/problem.html
[04:54:04] <phpboss> just view source
[04:54:12] <phpboss> images are SUEDO

[04:54:49] <gianiaz> blackspotwiggins, thank you :-)
[04:55:10] <jarco> Does .hassclass have an opposite?
[04:55:15] <jarco> sorry
[04:55:19] <jarco> HasClass
[04:55:54] <jarco> .doesnothasclass
[04:55:57] <jarco> like that
[04:56:40] <Spikes> gianiaz, another one, searches for td too: http://jsfiddle.net/ZVx9G/
[04:56:49] <xec_> jarco: i assume this is inside a conditional? just use ! to negate?
[04:56:58] <Spikes> phpboss, ok, gonna check it
[04:56:58] <jarco> yeah. I can do that
[04:57:14] <jarco> xec, thx.
[04:57:21] <Spikes> phpboss, pics doesn't seem to load

[04:59:59] <zsoc> hihi
[05:00:58] <zsoc> So I have this wonderful working ajax mess that I have all tidied up. I want to start using various animation/other goodness when the result comes back successful. Maybe after a certain animation when the request is send and then another when it comes back success. I suppose I shoud use the callback function queues?
[05:01:55] <mark-> Ive created a variable with multiple selectors, but cant seem to bind the toggle event to the object - any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/zNFLv/19545/edit
[05:02:25] <phpboss> mar, your fiddle is giving a 404
[05:02:30] <phpboss> makr
[05:02:38] <phpboss> mark....... Sorry
[05:03:10] <mark-> lemme check
[05:03:21] <Spikes> phpboss, http://jsfiddle.net/HTP53/
[05:03:36] <phpboss> Thanks Spikes
[05:03:47] <mark-> http://jsfiddle.net/zNFLv/
[05:03:56] <Spikes> phpboss, i'm not sure what should be happening, though. Just fixed some mistakes
[05:04:42] <beasty> hmm
[05:04:45] <beasty> http://jsfiddle.net/f7gGr/
[05:04:49] <beasty> what am i doing wrong here ?
[05:05:08] <beasty> mm
[05:05:38] <beasty> nm found it :)
[05:06:03] <phpboss> The images outside the header are thumbnails. When they are clicked The clicked thumbnail should expand and replace the header image. Moving in an arc from its current position to the position of the header
[05:06:22] <Spikes> phpboss, http://jsfiddle.net/HTP53/1/, commented out width/height animation, just to check if path works
[05:07:30] <phpboss> Spikes, Im posting a fiddle.
[05:12:27] <Spikes> phpboss, btw, have you thought about using bezier curve path instead of an arc? That way you can simply use current position of the element, destination position which shouldd be permanent and randomly set agle/length
[05:12:30] <Spikes> ?
[05:14:26] <phpboss> Tried curves too even a crazy sine wave but none of the animations would allow the thumb to leave its parent div and move into the header div....
[05:15:28] <juria_roberts> How do i get the source code of an iframe as text?
[05:16:52] <Spikes> phpboss, thumb have to have position absolute/fixed to be able to move around the page
[05:17:34] <phpboss> OOOOOOOOOOOK! I see.
[05:18:01] <Spikes> phpboss, http://jsfiddle.net/HTP53/3/
[05:18:04] <phpboss> I must remove the div from the document before moving it. Position:absolute does that.
[05:18:25] <Spikes> You can assign position on mouseenter
[05:18:48] <phpboss> but can I make it REPLACE the header img
[05:19:16] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/xwCxh/ - is there anyway to make the form look nicer and get it readable=
[05:20:27] <Spikes> phpboss, yeah, gimme a sec
[05:20:37] <phpboss> K
[05:20:43] <nFFF> nisseni, you have scopin issues with 'count'
[05:21:09] <nisseni> nFFF: yeah, noticed that...
[05:21:19] <phpboss> NISSENI, try wrapping it in a form and using css to style the form inputs
[05:21:49] <nisseni> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/xwCxh/1/
[05:22:10] <nisseni> phpboss: it's already in a form and it's styled, I mean make the code look nicer and readable...
[05:22:46] <Spikes> phpboss, very rough: http://jsfiddle.net/HTP53/4/
[05:25:17] <pllx> is there a simple way to double the size of an element using animate ? I tried   $(this).animate( {width : "*=2"}, slow);  but it's not working...
[05:25:28] <nisseni> nFFF: get my point and what I want to achieve?
[05:28:26] <Spikes> phpboss, a little bit more sane: http://jsfiddle.net/HTP53/6/
[05:32:07] <phpboss> spikes, on munchieedesigns.com/animate.html I will try bezier again
[05:37:21] <granden_> I'm having a bit of problem, I can stress my page so the jquery animation fails. If pressing left/right-arow fast a few times, 5-10 or so. It does not show any picture when the animations have completed.
[05:38:44] <xec_> granden_: i have the same issue on my page. if i press left/right arrows as much as 20 times in a row it still doesn't show an image. my url is: about:blank
[05:39:06] <phpboss> Spikes, I think I got it with the Beziers... Let me try a few things
[05:40:03] <Spikes> phpboss, good
[05:41:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How to make a selector to get a div with a class inside a td with an id
[05:41:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[05:41:49] <ajpiano> $("#foo div.bar")
[05:42:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ah right
[05:42:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> thx
[05:42:09] <Jon47> ecky--ptang-zoob: best practice: $('#td_id').find('div.className')
[05:42:45] <Daghdha> I have 'jquery.floatobject-1.4.js' and use it together with 'jquery-1.7.min.js'. It's not wo rking t hough, can that be because it's 1.4? It says the .makeFloat is not supported on the object. The object is not null, i tested. ANd the URL in the page for the javascript is correct.
[05:42:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[05:43:02] <Jon47> the id selector is almost instantaneous, and then you've got a really small DOM fragment within which to seek for your class name, which is a slightly less optimized query
[05:43:27] <Jon47> but practically, the speed won't make any difference unless you do it a thousand times
[05:43:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm doing like this: $('#classhour_' + params.hour + "_" + params.day).find('div.innerdiv').css("background-color", params.backgroundcolor);
[05:43:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but it's not applying to my div
[05:43:57] <ajpiano> ecky--ptang-zoob: why wouldn't you  just add a class to the TD itself
[05:44:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> because I have a smaller DIV inside there with rounded corners
[05:44:18] <Daghdha> I just wann glue a div to the top of the viewable area as the user scrolls down. Is there perhaps a more modern lib than FLoatObject someone can suggest?
[05:44:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and not the whole cell must color, only that div
[05:44:37] <ajpiano> $("#foo"+wat).addClass("someState");   #foo.somestate div.class { border-radius: 4px; }
[05:44:57] <ajpiano> ecky--ptang-zoob: did you forget about descendant selectors in that analysis
[05:45:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don't know...
[05:45:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> relatively new to jquery
[05:45:49] <ajpiano> you wanna talk about best practices.... avoiding doing .css() in your code and instead keeping your CSS in CSS and manipulating classes in js
[05:45:56] <ajpiano> now that's a best practise
[05:46:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[05:46:37] <granden_> xec_: Woops, sorry. Missed the url http://a45.se/a45
[05:47:56] <pllx> ajpiano : how do you get the width of a div elements without using css ? (I'm new to jquery... sorry if this is a dumb question)
[05:48:04] <ajpiano> ?width
[05:48:05] <bot-t> .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[05:48:07] <xec_> granden_: :)
[05:48:18] <ajpiano> or .css("width")
[05:48:22] <ajpiano> there's a diff between reading values and setting them
[05:48:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh yes, that I've read...
[05:48:50] <xec_> granden_: looks like there's a lot of javascript for no reason. you can probably use a slider plugin for this
[05:48:53] <pllx> ah thanks :)
[05:48:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> reading a good book about jquery... 1/3th in :)-
[05:49:33] <filipiz> ?ajax
[05:49:34] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:50:14] <xec_> granden_: have you looked at http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ ?
[05:51:27] <granden_> xec_: I thought of using a plugin for it. But when looking around what it should do it is a bit of javascript that needs to be executed each time.
[05:51:37] <granden_> Not just the slide part. But I started with this.
[05:52:19] <pllx> btw, why is it best to only manipulate class in js, and keep css declaration in css ?
[05:52:33] <xec_> ok, in any case i would structure it differently, looks like you're animating background and image separately - wouldnt it be easier to do the whole thing at once?
[05:52:58] <granden_> xec_: Yeah it would I think. How would I structure it differently?
[05:54:23] <xec_> granden_: have a full width element with a background color already set for each slide, then animate the opacity between the elements seems like the cleanest approach.
[05:54:47] <ajpiano> pllx: it means that when you need to maintain or tweak the CSS, you don't have to go digging into your JS to do so.  you just impart "state" with javascript, and then continue to actually keep the meat of your styling in CSS
[05:55:13] <xec_> granden_: mind if i PM you?
[05:55:29] <granden_> no
[05:55:32] <granden_> Its fine
[05:57:10] <pllx> ajpiano > can you use .animate() without redifining css styles of the animated element ?
[05:57:23] <ajpiano> nope
[05:59:15] <pllx> so best pratices should prohibit the usage of .animate() then     that is the function that drove me to jquery ...
[05:59:34] <ajpiano> that's not necessarily true...
[06:00:07] <gnarf> the animateClass stuff in ui effects core can help with that
[06:00:16] <ajpiano> first of all that
[06:00:17] <gnarf> lets you animate an addClass
[06:01:14] <pllx> ?animateClass
[06:01:16] <bot-t> pllx, UI/Effects/ClassTransitions - The jQuery UI effects core extends the base class API to be able to animate between two different classes. The following methods are changed. They now accept three additional parameters: speed , ea... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/ClassTransitions
[06:07:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there any way to calculate the exact opposite of a hex color?
[06:07:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Found some calculations that determine if the best contrasting color should be white or black... but perhaps there is a way to calculate the real exact complement color?
[06:10:22] <pllx> could it be something like rgb(255-r,255-g,255-b) ? you have to extract the r,g and b values first.
[06:11:24] <gnarf> ecky--ptang-zoob: hrm
[06:11:43] <gnarf> ecky--ptang-zoob: so the white or black thing is in the jQuery Color docs
[06:11:46] <gnarf> ?color
[06:11:46] <bot-t> jQuery Color Plugin - Adds the ability to do color animations to jQuery. Version 2.1.0 - http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/24/jquery-color-2-1-0/
[06:12:11] <gnarf> ecky--ptang-zoob: The "exact complement color" is not that useful from what I've seen
[06:12:51] <gnarf> ecky--ptang-zoob: but, it would basically be $.Color( value ).hue("+=180");
[06:13:19] <gnarf> it's easier to calculate compliments in hue / saturation / lightness format than rgb
[06:13:26] <gnarf> but jQuery color can convert to and from pretty quick

[06:16:38] <NexHD> hi
[06:17:17] <NexHD> can someone tell me about return function? i cant find anything about that?
[06:17:37] <gnarf> NexHD: ?
[06:17:50] <Daghdha> UNF... telerik is breaking it.
[06:17:53] <gnarf> NexHD: can you please try adding some more words to that question?
[06:18:16] <gnarf> or an example?
[06:18:55] <NexHD> whats happen when i add a return false or true in a function
[06:18:56] <NexHD> ?
[06:19:06] <gnarf> NexHD: depends on what the function is
[06:19:25] <gnarf> but, all functions return a value, undefined if nothing is specified
[06:19:59] <gnarf> event handlers interpret "return false" as a way to specifiy that you do not want the browser default, and do not want the event to propagate further up the DOM tree
[06:20:16] <gnarf> basically - event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()
[06:20:57] <gnarf> jQuery.each interprets a return false as a way to exit the current loop
[06:23:18] <NexHD> i have a anonymous function when an focus and blur function im using return true on focus and blur functions and in the anonymous im using return false, i want to stop that anonymous function until focus and blur return treue
[06:27:38] <sameersegal> I am trying to create a jquery, jqueryui and backbone couchapp (simple <script> tags in index.html). While $ is defined, $.ui is not -- any ideas?
[06:28:01] <sameersegal> In firebug I can see that the script is getting included
[06:32:32] <gnarf> NexHD: I'm sorry, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me - see ?paste
[06:32:33] <bot-t> NexHD, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:38:03] <pllx> correct me if I'm wrong : the width() function does not support the *= operator ? (only += and -= )
[06:39:23] <sydar> Hello I have an issuer regarding mouseenter and mousleave over various elemnts.

[07:05:59] <sjeijk> is there a way to select all previous elements until some class?
[07:07:12] <xec_> nope
[07:07:22] <xec_> well, yes
[07:07:30] <xec_> .nextAll() ?
[07:07:54] <xec_> by elements you mean siblings?
[07:08:01] <sjeijk> umm, i need it for read more / less stuff.. http://jsfiddle.net/wYdfD/
[07:08:03] <xec_> or parents?
[07:08:05] <Zeeshan_M> In my JS code, I am calling a function which triggers an AJAX POST request. In this AJAX code, I use the success: event to see if I need to redo the request (based on what the remote server said).
[07:08:20] <sjeijk> i use next all for all next elms
[07:08:25] <Zeeshan_M> I am finding that my recurisive calls to the AJAX function fail if I show the user a native alert dialog (via alert()).
[07:08:30] <xec_> .prevAll() then?
[07:08:49] <sjeijk> yes that works but i need to prevail until read-more
[07:08:53] <Zeeshan_M> I am unable to trace the issue via Firebug, and can avoid the issue if I use console.log(). The alert dialog seems to be 'stopping' something.
[07:08:53] <sjeijk> ill try
[07:09:20] <Zeeshan_M> What's going on and how can I ensure I can present an alert dialog to the user without my JS failing?
[07:09:35] <xec_> oooh ooh, maybe .prevUntil()?
[07:12:42] <sjeijk> ah nice http://jsfiddle.net/wYdfD/2/
[07:12:54] <NexHD> hi
[07:13:17] <NexHD> how i add a counter to a function to use for validation?
[07:13:42] <sjeijk> not sure if thats the best way, but it works, tx again xec_
[07:14:18] <xec_> sjeijk: i would do it differently, first remove the buttons from the markup itself
[07:16:23] <sjeijk> The client needs to decide where the read more button shows… so thats not really an option .. i could get rid of the last read less button
[07:16:41] <xec_> sjeijk: have js add them, so that if js is disabled you can still access the content
[07:17:14] <sjeijk> point taken
[07:18:58] <sjeijk> in this case if no js then content won't be hidden, but an ugly read more btw without functionality will show up… ill make modernizer hide it
[07:19:11] <sjeijk> btw=btn
[07:26:48] <NexHD> how i use events inside the function?
[07:27:04] <xec_> sjeijk: i made this http://jsfiddle.net/wYdfD/3/
[07:27:19] <xec_> sjeijk: glancing at it now it looks sort of messy still though :p
[07:30:23] <xec_> NexHD: gonna need more details, what exactly are you doing?
[07:30:51] <Mo9a7i> Hello, What's the best star-rating plugin that i can use with drop down menus ?
[07:33:06] <Daghdha> Hi. Anyone familiar with floatObject? when i do restartFloat the div does't move untill i scroll the page
[07:33:45] <ralphholzmann> Daghdha: nope
[07:33:49] <ralphholzmann> but the simple solution might be
[07:34:00] <ralphholzmann> $.trigger( window, "scroll" );
[07:36:23] <Daghdha> Says it don't know .trigger
[07:37:26] <xec_> $(window).trigger("scroll") ?
[07:38:02] <ralphholzmann> yeah, that
[07:38:06] * ralphholzmann rusty on jquery api
[07:38:35] <Daghdha> no, so far not
[07:39:00] <xec_> not sure if that would work if the event handler wasn't registered using jquery
[07:39:12] <Daghdha> it is though
[07:39:14] <xec_> but, the scrolling might "trigger" something else
[07:39:18] <Daghdha> registered trough jquery
[07:39:35] <xec_> i.e. it's not the scroll event making your thing happen ;)
[07:39:40] <Daghdha> the stupid thing is the lib does move it when it's 1st set to .makeFloat
[07:39:41] <xec_> do you have a live url?
[07:39:46] <Daghdha> No
[07:40:04] <xec_> can you reproduce the behaviour in jsfiddle.net?
[07:40:40] <NexHD> how can i use a return false outside of a function
[07:40:41] <NexHD> ?
[07:40:53] <xec_> NexHD: that doesn't make any sense
[07:40:57] <xec_> ?xy @ NexHD
[07:40:57] <bot-t> NexHD, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[07:41:36] <xec_> solve for X.
[07:43:06] <Daghdha> solved it..
[07:43:28] <Daghdha> Was me, not the lib
[07:44:33] <NexHD> i have a anonymous function and inside of them i have a validation with focus and blur function and after i have a ajax function i want to use a return false in ajax function definited in blur function

[07:52:40] <ralphholzmann> davetarmac you're missing the closing paren on the if statement
[07:53:32] <sjeijk> tx btw _xec for that example…
[07:53:51] <davetarmac> ralphholzmann: thanks for that

[07:54:31] <davetarmac> this is the full script: http://pastebin.com/y6gMbdx0
[07:55:01] <davetarmac> the hover works perfectly, it's just the if that isn't working
[07:57:24] <johnkpaul> davetarmac: that if is not running after domready
[07:57:38] <johnkpaul> so there is no .mainmenu-advice at the time that code runs
[07:57:47] <johnkpaul> move into into a jQuery(document).ready

[08:00:29] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: http://allenbridge.launcharea.co.uk/  <-- that's the page
[08:00:56] <davetarmac> I have removed the last part of the jquery (the ready and the if)
[08:01:13] <davetarmac> and the Advice button changes to AllenbridgeEpic when hovered over
[08:01:15] <johnkpaul> davetarmac: it does not have the class qtip-hover
[08:01:20] <johnkpaul> so the condition is false
[08:01:31] <johnkpaul> oh, do you want that code to run every time a hover happens?
[08:01:36] <johnkpaul> if so, put it inside your hover handlers
[08:02:27] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: when you hover over advice, you will see the qtip-hover appears as a class
[08:02:31] <davetarmac> when the menu drops down
[08:02:43] <johnkpaul> davetarmac: right, so that conditional only runs once
[08:02:53] <johnkpaul> you want it to run every time a hover happens
[08:03:02] <davetarmac> I need it to stay as AllenbridgeEpic whilst qtip-hover is in the class list
[08:03:45] <davetarmac> which includes when the pointer is off the menu item and over the drop down
[08:04:30] <johnkpaul> davetarmac: where does qtip-hover come from, I Don't see that in your code
[08:04:46] <davetarmac> when you hover over Advice
[08:05:07] <davetarmac> on the <a>, the qtip-hover class appears
[08:05:40] <davetarmac> should be in the same list as a.mainmenu-advice
[08:07:26] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: do you see it?
[08:08:48] <johnkpaul> davetarmac: I see it in the live page, I mean the code for it
[08:09:19] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: it's dynamically put in there by the qtip library
[08:09:43] <johnkpaul> davetarmac: I'm confused though, your updateHoverSTates function is doing the same thing
[08:09:48] <johnkpaul> it's updating the text to "New Text"
[08:09:51] <johnkpaul> why do you need to do it twice?
[08:09:57] <davetarmac> the hover states are working for hovers
[08:10:14] <davetarmac> the New Text isn't staying when I use the subnav
[08:10:27] <davetarmac> it only stays as newtext for as long as the cursor is over the link
[08:11:05] <davetarmac> when I've got my cursor over the submenu - the qtip-hover class is still there, so the New Text needs to be there also
[08:11:33] <prometh> anyone looking for a freelance user-experience (ux) guy? i'm looking for a few contracts while i look for my next full-time job. PM me
[08:11:33] <Rhainur> is it possible to do a cross-domain POST request via jquery?
[08:11:41] <Rhainur> jquery seems to be forcibly using GET
[08:11:52] <Rhainur> the moment I change to a local domain, it does POST
[08:13:23] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: do you understand my problem?
[08:14:05] <johnkpaul> davetarmac: is .mainmenu-advice not the parent element of this submenu?
[08:14:25] <davetarmac> no, it's on the same element
[08:14:54] <johnkpaul> then why is the hover off-handler being called?
[08:15:45] <davetarmac> I 'borrowed' that code, hoping it would work
[08:19:34] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: even if I remove the off-handler, the site just doesn't change the text anymore
[08:19:52] <Rhainur> is it possible to make a cross-domain POST request?
[08:20:18] <prometh> yes
[08:20:31] <prometh> depends on the server's security restrictions, however
[08:23:24] <johnkpaul> davetarmac: I don't mean to remove the off handler, I mean use that to update the text appropriately
[08:23:37] <johnkpaul> but it seems like that's already working, but the off handler is called when the mouse moves to it's children
[08:23:54] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: sorry  -I don't understand
[08:28:32] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: semi-success!
[08:28:34] <davetarmac> http://pastebin.com/yHMef2qG
[08:29:00] <davetarmac> only problem now is that when I move off the menu item, and the subnav - the menu doesn't change back
[08:29:32] <johnkpaul> awesome davetarmac
[08:30:04] <davetarmac> johnkpaul: any ideas how I can fix this lsat hurdle?

[08:30:39] <jedimind> do you have to jump the hurdles while answering questions?
[08:31:41] <Whirl3d> Has anybody used concrete5? And is it worth learning? Or should I stick with Joomla or Drupal for CMS?

[08:34:45] <majd> hey #jquery - i'm using the editable plugin: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/default.html - i want the field to be editable only if some condition is true, so i put a click handler like so: http://dpaste.org/hD6bx/
[08:35:16] <majd> but clicking on the editable area still brings up the edit form, even if the condition is not true...
[08:35:19] <majd> what am i missing?
[08:36:03] <Duzzy> Hey, im trying to remove the href link here http://jsfiddle.net/SgJx9/ but I want to keep the rest, is that possible? I've tried the unwrap() but that doesnt seem to do the trick
[08:39:16] <majd> Duzzy: $("a").removeAttr("href");​
[08:42:54] <Duzzy> hmm, can I use a selector some how? Like the class? I tried using the class instead but got an JS error that says Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[08:43:17] <mark-> is there a way to get the css ID of the HTMLElement that was clicked?  I have a bunch of selectors with a click event, but when i click one, i want to try get the id of that actual element (they all have a unique id)
[08:44:08] <majd> Duzzy: $(".myClass").removeAttr("href");​
[08:44:30] <Duzzy> majd: thats what I tried, but got that syntax exception
[08:44:39] <mark-> if I log THIS, I get "object object"
[08:46:37] <mark-> log("clicked: " +$('this'.id));
[08:47:33] <Duzzy> majd: Must have come some bad characters when I copied it, work now when I re-typed it manually, thanks man

[08:52:30] <joris> Hi. How do I get an elements inner html as text, so I can do a .replace() on it?
[08:52:41] <afidegnum> hello good morning,
[08:53:06] <dogarrhea2_> ok. i see there is something called window.performance.now() which is non standard (which is basically every thing new and useful in the web dev world)
[08:54:13] <wachpwnski> has anyone here messed with google apis?
[08:54:56] <d4ndy> hello
[08:55:11] <d4ndy> is 'onchange' ONLY meant to fire when the focus leaves the input field?
[08:55:46] <afidegnum> I am stacked along the way, do anyone has a membership management in jquerymobile?
[08:55:58] <d4ndy> i'm trying to setup a function to run as the user types, so that when the length of the value of the field is above 4, an action happens. but using 'onchange', the action only happens once the user clicks out of the field (ie, blur).
[09:01:23] <arielserafini> d4ndy: have you tried keypress?
[09:01:37] <arielserafini> or keydown
[09:05:28] <majd> How can i prevent the default behaviour of jeditable? I only want the text field to appear if certain condition is true
[09:17:53] <mark-> is it possible to format the following 2 statements into 1? http://jsfiddle.net/fbRy3/
[09:18:57] <wachpwnski> When I do alert(trgtColumn.html());  why does it echo out 3 times on me?
[09:19:32] <dabear> mark-: nextBlock = nextBlock[this.id-1];
[09:19:38] <Woet> wachpwnski: because that code is triggered 3 times.
[09:20:23] <mark-> dabear: thanks!
[09:20:39] <wachpwnski> Woet: I don't know how so. But that is what I was thinking about
[09:20:43] <wachpwnski> do I have to set it as a var first?
[09:20:49] <Woet> wachpwnski: no, alert only alerts once
[09:20:56] <Woet> wachpwnski: but your code makes it trigger 3 times.
[09:21:00] <Woet> wachpwnski: aka, the code you're not showing us.
[09:21:31] <wachpwnski> Woet, I am working with googles visualization api
[09:22:58] <wachpwnski> Give me a minute I will post
[09:24:20] <mark-> dabear: gettin NaN - nextBlock was origionally defined ans a number?
[09:25:14] <TeddyMurray> Hi, how do I setup autocomplete({
[09:25:14] <TeddyMurray> 	source: "/ClubGroup/unit_list/" + term}); ?
[09:25:39] <TeddyMurray> term is undefined, but it does http://pracemanager.com/ClubGroup/unit_list?term=53 rather than http://pracemanager.com/ClubGroup/unit_list?/53
[09:26:17] <TeddyMurray> hi
[09:27:16] <afidegnum> hello, anyone has a session based jquery mobile app? speciall for user login and regstration ?
[09:30:00] <TeddyMurray> in jquery, is it possible to change the autocomplete from /?term=53 to /53 --- im using a mod rewrite and the variable needs to show as a "folder"
[09:30:14] <TeddyMurray> afidegnum, like php sessions?
[09:30:26] <afidegnum> yes
[09:30:43] <TeddyMurray> yes ive worked on one called phonetasy
[09:30:57] <afidegnum> in fact, I am trying to create a user registration and member loin script using jquery mobile so users can with their phone access their content
[09:31:22] <afidegnum> TeddyMurray: can you pls give a hand abt it pls?
[09:31:43] <TeddyMurray> mind if i pm you?
[09:32:17] <TeddyMurray> im sort've busy on my own project but i can guide you
[09:32:31] <TeddyMurray> you will need to write a php script that sends JSON data to your jquery mobile app
[09:32:42] <TeddyMurray> or you could use xml, but i recommend json
[09:33:27] <afidegnum> yes
[09:33:31] <afidegnum> you can pm me
[09:34:10] <Daghdha> Is it possible setting an images opacity affects it's z-index also?
[09:34:13] <TeddyMurray> afidegnum, so how far along are you?
[09:34:44] <TeddyMurray> Daghdha, i think that's a CSS question, probably would get a better response there
[09:34:55] <TeddyMurray> #css
[09:34:56] <afidegnum> so far, I am ready about JQM tutorial, I also have in hand some few php membership script
[09:35:10] <prometh> anyone looking for a freelance user-experience (ux) guy? i'm looking for a few contracts while i look for my next full-time job. PM me
[09:35:20] <Daghdha> I use .fadeTo
[09:35:26] <afidegnum> but I want to blend it so It will be a unique mobile App, in fact a mobile based website.
[09:36:01] <prometh> Daghdha: write a function
[09:36:51] <prometh> function setOpacity(val){ if (val>=0.5) /*do shit*/ else /*do shit*/ }
[09:38:00] <visof> hello
[09:38:09] <prometh> call that function using the "step" modifier in animate()
[09:38:20] <prometh> err not modifier, argument
[09:38:47] <visof> how can i do this: country select when you choose specific country it loads its towns in another select
[09:39:06] <visof> can anyone understand what do i mean ?
[09:41:13] <phelix> I am trying to use a piece of jquery or javascript that will fade a specific block in on my page. I am using script.js and the page is here. http://gvdcorp.dev.tributemedia.com/ But it doesn't seem that its working properly. The item on the right side of the page where it says "Hey Hey" should fade on the page after a small period of time. Anyone see what I may be missing here?
[09:42:56] <TeddyMurray> in jquery, is it possible to change the autocomplete from /?term=53 to /53 --- im using a mod rewrite and the variable needs to show as a "folder"
[09:44:29] <Daghdha> prometh: It was one of those rare programmer errors 'cough'. ANyway thanks for input :P Found the culprit! (put z-index on a wrong div somewhere)
[09:54:28] <prometh> oh, you were encountering an issue
[09:54:28] <prometh> didn't realize
[10:06:52] <wachpwnski> can anyone tell me why my columns won't populate?
[10:07:33] <wachpwnski> http://jsfiddle.net/sh5hF/1/

[10:23:29] <Heather_> Hey could someone help me get this ajax request to work properly? http://pastebin.com/7bvGK2bQ Im using firebug and it reacts to my clicking the image. but the callback function is not working.
[10:23:47] <Heather_> the pastebin includes the relevant part of my php file.
[10:25:44] <TeddyMurray> i figured it out, i needed to use a callback function as the source for autocomplete
[10:27:18] <t432> console.log(object) outputs " [object Object]".. what does this mean? do I have to cast it? if so how?
[10:28:17] <Eviltwin> Are you using an old IE?
[10:28:32] <t432> was that to me?
[10:28:44] <t432> no, firefox
[10:29:14] <Eviltwin> Hmm, then I suspect at some point you mistakenly did something like object = "" + object
[10:29:57] <t432> server is returning a "List<Objects>" not sure if that has anything to do with it?
[10:30:31] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/uT2Pa/
[10:30:58] <t432> here is what i am doing: success:function(data) {$.each(data, function(index, obj){	console.log("Object: "+obj);	})
[10:31:07] <Eviltwin> vs http://jsfiddle.net/uT2Pa/1/
[10:31:11] <Eviltwin> Yeah, that's your problem
[10:31:16] <Eviltwin> You're adding a string to it
[10:31:39] <Eviltwin> You can't do that
[10:31:54] <Eviltwin> You can do this though: console.log("Object: ", obj);
[10:32:37] <t432> aha
[10:32:41] <t432> got it
[10:36:38] <wachpwnski> http://jsfiddle.net/rXh6S/2/ <- I have two issues with this code. ajax wont add the data, and on table click, the event gets triggered by number of table clicks. On the first click one event, on the second click 2.
[10:47:56] <Dexec> Gentlemen, is there a way to stopPropagation to a parent <label> element?
[10:48:19] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there a shorthand way to toggle the checked attribut on a checkbox?  Rather than if( .is(':checked') ) $(this).attr('checked',false);  ?
[10:48:59] <Eviltwin> FunnyLookinHat: $(this).prop('checked', !$(this).prop('checked'))?
[10:49:07] <FunnyLookinHat> err.
[10:49:08] <FunnyLookinHat> duh.
[10:49:11] <FunnyLookinHat> thx.
[10:52:16] <madmn> no way to check jquryui stuff on jsfiddle?
[10:52:57] <Eviltwin> Try choosing jQuery 1.7.2 instead of jQuery 1.8.0
[10:53:12] <madmn> ty
[10:57:56] <madmn> hmm, too bad it doesnt let you load jqueryui css. in any case, I have a input type checkbox which I do .button() on to stylize it, but changing the prop checked to true or false, does not change the button to checked or not, stays the same.
[10:58:24] <madmn> works fine if I dont use .button() on it
[11:01:05] <NoiseEee> madmn: how does one 'check' a button?
[11:01:53] <madmn> NoiseEee, changing the attr('checked', 'checked') or .prop('checked', true) .. since it is a checbox
[11:02:15] <Eviltwin> I didn't realize buttons were checkboxes
[11:03:00] <madmn> Eviltwin, I am using .button() on a checkbox. so in essence, it is still a checkbox, is it not?
[11:03:09] <Heather_> Could someone take a look at this ajax request? http://pastebin.com/nxZ0k9E6 the requst works fine i.e alert dialogue pops up. But I cant seem to parse the json in the callback function and assing it to a variable.
[11:03:12] <madmn> since  you can enable it and disable it
[11:04:59] <Eviltwin> madmn: You may want to look at the refresh method here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
[11:06:34] <madmn> Eviltwin, thanks. odd
[11:06:49] <Eviltwin> Not particularly
[11:06:56] <Eviltwin> The widget can't listen to attribute changes
[11:07:15] <madmn> Well, I thought it would :) ah well, go figure, thanks
[11:07:18] <Eviltwin> So if you change an attribute, it isn't automatically triggered to update the class
[11:07:31] <Eviltwin> A .click() on the button would probably update it
[11:08:35] <NoiseEee> Heather_: if the response is sending proper headers, its likely a json string already.  console.log(data);  what do you get?
[11:14:23] <Heather_> NoiseEee should be $.parseJSON not $.parsejson thanks though working now.
[11:31:18] <ShawnRisk> How come this code: http://pastebin.com/n0pWyz1g doesn't clear textboxes?
[11:32:01] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: $('.form-text').val('') is all you need.
[11:33:02] <ShawnRisk> NoiseEee: I can take out everything else, and just put <script> $('.form-text').val(''); </script>
[11:33:07] <ShawnRisk> ?
[11:33:31] <tw2113> every form input with that class would clear
[11:33:56] <Eviltwin> This works: http://jsfiddle.net/WqAz7/
[11:34:29] <ShawnRisk> okay
[11:35:44] <ShawnRisk> Eviltwin: thanks
[11:35:48] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: tha is what I thought
[11:39:41] <NexHD> i have this  http://jsfiddle.net/insetpixel/eC5vN/ , and i want when i press the submit button to show the errors if exist and not submit the form?
[11:40:33] <Eviltwin> NexHD: Listen to the "submit" event of the form instead. You can preventDefault() on it to prevent the form from being submitted if there are errors
[11:42:41] <NexHD> and if is true, will submit the form
[11:42:41] <NexHD> ?

[12:24:28] <NexHD> yes like that
[12:28:55] <NexHD> i want to ask you eviltwin , in older code that i have send here , why that wont worked?
[12:29:28] <wachpwnski> can someone tell my why I get multiple calls on this after the first click? http://jsfiddle.net/mfy5J/
[12:30:05] <NexHD> if i removed the blur function it worked ,
[12:32:18] <Eviltwin> NexHD: By returning false on blur you preventDefault for that event which I believe prevents the click event from firing

[12:54:05] <xec> ctrl+c
[12:54:50] <dogarrhea2> xec, nope
[12:56:44] <dogarrhea2> why the hell have they disabled the copying of cookie data
[12:56:46] <dogarrhea2> this is ridiculous
[12:57:14] <dogarrhea2> oh

[12:57:28] <dogarrhea2> lolololol fail UI
[13:00:05] <dogarrhea2> oh. now i see what's going on... the highlighting of the text to be copied when you quadruple click is the same color as the background color the text is on :/
[13:07:08] <gchristensen> is there a great tagging library/tool? with autocomplete, idealy it would also keep the input field up to date the whole time... right now I'm using https://github.com/xoxco/jQuery-Tags-Input but it doesn't seem very good

[13:24:05] <Gates> it doesnt seem to work but with .text() the code does work, so i assume it has to do with attr and src
[13:25:11] <Gates> oohh the image is not in .
[13:25:13] <Gates> catcol_img
[13:26:09] <Gates> How do i do this > image?
[13:26:11] <Gates> $(this + "img")
[13:26:35] <dogarrhea2> oh
[13:26:53] <Gates> Is it? $("img", this)
[13:26:55] <Gates> is that correct?
[13:27:07] <astropirate> Gates,  $(this).find('img')
[13:27:14] <astropirate> are you looking for a direct child?
[13:27:16] <dogarrhea2> some asshole decided it was ok to put a large block comment 50 lines long between myfunctiondefinition:  and the function being declared
[13:27:18] <astropirate> or any children
[13:27:31] <Gates> yes, the html is in that paste bin
[13:27:36] <Gates> http://pastebin.com/d0rCFSTm
[13:27:45] <Gates> there is only 1 image under that div
[13:27:48] <Gates> (alway)
[13:28:10] <astropirate> Gates, yah, $(this).find('img')   or $(this).children()  will work too if it only has img children
[13:28:22] <Gates> okay thanks
[13:28:22] <astropirate> or $(this).children('img')
[13:28:25] <astropirate> take your pick
[13:29:10] <Gates> $(this).find('img') is what i have and it doesnt work
[13:29:13] <Gates> it hides the image
[13:29:18] <Gates> and never re-adds it
[13:30:29] <astropirate> Gates, just do $myImages = $(this).children();   and then just reference $myImages variable
[13:30:32] <astropirate> to do operations
[13:30:37] <astropirate> its an instance of jQuery
[13:31:20] <Gates> children?
[13:31:23] <Gates> i dont follow exactly
[13:31:47] <astropirate> children()  gives you all of the chilren of the  dom elemnt
[13:31:51] <Gates> http://pastebin.com/xE7pNvmn
[13:31:58] <medicineuk> Hello ladies and gents
[13:32:21] <astropirate> Gates, the "this" refers to the elemtn thats currently being selected
[13:32:25] <medicineuk> does anyone here know anything about )'Auth and access tokens
[13:32:26] <astropirate> sec let me revise you code
[13:32:36] <medicineuk> o'Auth
[13:33:19] <Gates> astropirate: kk thanks
[13:34:53] <astropirate> Gates, http://pastebin.com/G4eEgXLD
[13:35:20] <astropirate> thats just one of many ways of doing it
[13:36:13] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance jQuery/Node.js/C++ developer? PM me please :)
[13:36:20] <Gates> astropirate: thats way too much of a rewrite that breaks everything
[13:38:02] <Eviltwin> astropirate: I think you're much more likely to find interest if you stick around and look for people trying to build big jQuery things
[13:38:08] <Eviltwin> They come and go all the time
[13:38:38] <Eviltwin> It also helps if you help people with their smaller problems for free first
[13:38:45] <astropirate> Eviltwin, I'm always here :D  I dont see any big projects here besides new users needing help with simple things
[13:39:12] <astropirate> Eviltwin, you never see me helping people? :O
[13:39:33] <Eviltwin> Didn't say that :P
[13:39:58] <Gates> astropirate: this worked, http://pastebin.com/KGJRPM4d
[13:40:23] <medicineuk> anyone OAuth Experience? is it ok to embed a access_token in to a javascript file. Or is that terrible practice
[13:40:35] <Gates> good luck
[13:40:39] <astropirate> Gates, exellent. I was about to write another verison for you
[13:40:49] <astropirate> but you beet me to it XD
[13:40:49] <Gates> <3
[13:40:54] <Eviltwin> There was someone in here who went by muzone, mikkelb, and youngin at various points who was looking for a jQuery dev for a large-ish project
[13:41:02] <Eviltwin> Not sure if he's still here or still needs that
[13:42:59] <Eviltwin> astropirate: Also you've sent all of about 700 messages to the channel since I've been here
[13:43:06] <Eviltwin> I'm past 23,000 :P
[13:43:11] <Gabriel___> is it possible to trigger something like $("#varId").change(function(){ from another function? like a form submittion routine for example ?
[13:43:24] <Eviltwin> $("#varId").change() ?
[13:43:32] <Eviltwin> ?see .trigger

[13:58:21] <Krambiorix> hi guys, does anyone use tinybox?
[14:03:36] <Guest54712> Hello, im having problem with making each div unique when using  onfocus="reply()" onblur="reply()" basically when a user tries to reply for a comment only one textarea should open but now they way it works all of them open at the same time
[14:04:27] <astropirate> Guest11445, don't mix your javascript with your HTML
[14:04:44] <astropirate> just set up event handlers using jquery
[14:04:58] <Guest54712> how can i do this?
[14:05:09] <astropirate> $('someElement').on('blur', someFunctionToCall)
[14:05:49] <Guest54712> so this will pick each element instead of all of them?
[14:06:41] <astropirate> Guest11445, yes.  the  "this"  inside the callback function will refer to the individual elemnt
[14:06:50] <astropirate> so you can do:
[14:07:12] <astropirate> $('someElement').on('blur', function(){  $(this)doSomeThingInteresting();  })
[14:07:26] <astropirate> ^^ forgot the . after $(this)
[14:08:48] <Guest54712> thank you astropirate
[14:08:53] <Guest54712> i see what i can do
[14:08:54] <Guest54712> :)
[14:21:10] <Krambiorix> when opening a tinybox i get : [object Object] , that's all... ANyone?
[14:22:42] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to search through all sources on chrome?
[14:29:43] <Guest54712> astropirate for some reason its not working http://jsfiddle.net/8Zc6Y/ if you could take a look at this please
[14:30:48] <cruisemaniac> hi, I'm working on some basic query to show a popup when a text is selected…
[14:34:07] <dogarrhea2> how do you put a breakpoint somewhere on a listener like click for a button if you don't know where the source is?
[14:39:59] <astropirate> Guest11445,  :S  onClick is not a function
[14:42:16] <Zzaichik> you mean, using the javascript attr in html and declaring onClick isn't current?!
[14:42:26] <astropirate> Guest11445, i'm not sure what you want to do but here is the correct syntax http://jsfiddle.net/8Zc6Y/9/
[14:42:34] <astropirate> warp the whole thin in a dom ready callback
[14:42:51] <astropirate> Zzaichik, afraid it is before its time
[14:44:36] <frewsxcv> If I have a page and I have jquery insert elements on to that page, and then click on a link on that page, press the back button, and the cached page doesn't have the inserted elements. is there a way to have the browser reset the cache so that it includes the inserted elements
[14:48:36] <Guest54712> astropirate brb
[14:52:54] <soahccc> Hmmm… Why does this not work? :) http://nopaste.me/paste/205621131504677f7173d3  It do creates the window and adds the listener but it doesn't captures any click ;/
[14:53:35] <ryanneufeld> what is @
[14:53:43] <astropirate> soahccc, what the hell is that?
[14:54:01] <ryanneufeld> also wtf is with the formatting on that paste
[14:54:17] <ryanneufeld> ?jsfiddle @ soahccc
[14:54:18] <bot-t> soahccc, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[14:54:40] <astropirate> soahccc, not a lot of jQuery users use coffeescript
[14:54:41] <soahccc> ryanneufeld: Oh sorry it was the wrong paste :) This is coffeescript
[14:54:51] <astropirate> so support will be lacking
[14:55:03] <astropirate> could yo uconvert that to good ol' JS please?
[14:55:59] <soahccc> astropirate: Yeah I did but I try to fiddle it in to jsfiddle :)
[14:56:58] <astropirate> ok
[14:58:07] <soahccc> Hmmm don't know how to "fiddle" a popup there… but I try to capture custom events from the popup (click for testing)
[14:58:09] <soahccc> http://jsfiddle.net/8Xv59/
[15:06:52] <soahccc> astropirate: it works "manually" though http://nopaste.me/paste/193658240750467b69a14b5
[15:06:59] <soahccc> alert(2) works
[15:07:41] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there an easy way to remove a background-color value that's added to an element's style attribute by jquery ui?
[15:11:49] <Guest54712> astropirate what im making a comment feature where the user is able to reply to certain comment and when someone clicks the reply link it should show the div with the textarea but otherwise its hidden, the problem is i want to make it so it only pick that one div when the user clicks on the reply and not all of them
[15:12:03] <hambuglar> so there's no way to detect when a cookie is set?
[15:15:39] <Guest54712> astropirate here is the link http://jsfiddle.net/8Zc6Y/9/
[15:24:07] <deximat> hambuglar, alert( $.cookie("example") );
[15:33:35] <Guest54712> still wondering how to make this jquery work so it only works for certain link not all of them
[15:34:27] <tw2113> Guest54712, give each link their own unique class
[15:35:41] <Guest54712> tw2113 that wont work since its basically something where the user click on reply  and another div with a textarea should  appear
[15:36:19] <Guest54712> but not sure how to make it so it pick certain one not when they click reply all of them show
[15:37:27] <dogarrhea2> argh. i still don't know where the cookies are being set
[15:38:03] <dogarrhea2> some requests are sent back to the server old ajax style (checking session state and such).  and that's where the debugging code ends.  then somehow magically a cookie variable is set
[15:38:09] <dogarrhea2> but i don't know where or how
[15:44:01] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:55:37] <Guest54712> anyone could help ?

[16:30:27] <Emn1ty> and spits you out
[16:43:56] <digitalcakestudi> I got a textarea that when I do a val() on it, I loose linebreaks
[16:44:31] <digitalcakestudi> is there a better way to get the text from a textarea that keeps the linebreaks?
[16:45:40] <digitalcakestudi> I would not normally care about line breaks but "some \n text" becomes "sometext" for each line break
[16:47:03] <astropirate> digitalcakestudi, can you replicate this in jsfiddle
[16:47:10] <digitalcakestudi> sure
[16:47:21] <Eviltwin> digitalcakestudi: Try .text()?
[16:47:30] <Eviltwin> Or .html()?
[16:47:39] <digitalcakestudi> nice thanks thats what I was looking for
[16:52:05] <blindMoe> does anyone mind taking a look at this to see if they can figure out why the mapTimer seems to queue itself up instead of clearing?
[16:53:22] <Eviltwin> What is "this"?
[16:53:39] <blindMoe> haha oh jeez sorry.. I thought it pasted
[16:53:45] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/qfVd5/
[16:54:35] <blindMoe> google maps calls the center_changed event a ton of times on a single move of the page so I want to ensure that the user has stopped moving before calling my drawMap() so that it isn't called a hundred times a second
[16:54:41] <MistuhKurtz> Eviltwin, I almost told you "it's the object that the function is a method of," lol
[16:54:50] <blindMoe> hehe
[16:57:04] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: what happens is that it starts just repeating itself every 10 seconds even though the page is not moving
[16:57:08] <digitalcakestudi> http://jsfiddle.net/Xnz74/1/ so I'm still having issues with get the text out of text area
[16:57:25] <azbyin> hi all.. in a jqueryui accordionchange event handler, is it possible to determine the index of the current selection?
[16:57:46] <ngharo> digitalcakestudi: use .val() to get input values
[16:58:05] <digitalcakestudi> I do that but it removes the linebreaks
[16:58:45] <coldhead> i'm going for a wee
[16:58:53] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[16:58:55] <coldhead> >: |
[16:59:01] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[16:59:11] <digitalcakestudi> is there a way to get html encode or at least the linebreaks
[16:59:17] <ngharo> digitalcakestudi: nah, it doesn't.  you need to convert them to html <br>eaks
[17:00:03] <digitalcakestudi> so in this example I use val and tried to get the val that had line breaks http://jsfiddle.net/Xnz74/2/ where am I going wrong
[17:00:06] <Eviltwin> blindMoe: Not sure why it's not working
[17:00:09] <Eviltwin> blindMoe: This works: http://jsfiddle.net/XSSvM/
[17:00:49] <ngharo> digitalcakestudi: http://jsfiddle.net/Xnz74/3/
[17:00:59] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: hrmm yes it does.. I will keep trying some thing to see what I can get
[17:01:17] <blindMoe> I wonder if the google maps api is called center_changed even though it isn't changing which is calling that function again.. and again.. and again
[17:01:43] <digitalcakestudi> I'm sending it via ajax is there a way to get it as encoded?
[17:03:00] <ngharo> you shouldnt have to do anything.  just grab .val() and put it in your request.  you should see your line breaks server side
[17:03:27] <digitalcakestudi> like for example %0D
[17:04:00] <digitalcakestudi> derp nvm
[17:04:50] <digitalcakestudi> Dont you love it when you answer you own question out loud.  Thanks again ngharo
[17:04:59] <ngharo> :)
[17:05:26] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: it is google maps doing it
[17:05:48] <barryhjames> Trying to figure out why this isn't working...
[17:05:50] <barryhjames> http://jsfiddle.net/pfSHS/
[17:06:11] <barryhjames> Basically, I just need it to add an additional input field when a user clicks the button.
[17:06:34] <hitesa> I need ruby on rails 120k USD
[17:06:37] <hitesa> year
[17:06:46] <hitesa> 7 years exp
[17:06:48] <blindMoe> BarryCarlyon: because you are appending an input box into another input box
[17:07:28] <BarryCarlyon> wrong barry :-P
[17:07:35] <Eviltwin> barryhjames: http://jsfiddle.net/pfSHS/1/
[17:07:40] <blindMoe> barryhjames: http://jsfiddle.net/pfSHS/2/
[17:07:44] <blindMoe> ahh Eviltwin beat me
[17:08:09] <blindMoe> and he did a better job ;)
[17:08:09] <Eviltwin> I don't think .attr('id', 'asdf') is a good approach
[17:08:15] <barryhjames> I am a joke. You are the real deal.  Thanks so much. Stupid mistake.
[17:08:42] <hitesa> no one codes on ruby on grails ?
[17:08:43] <blindMoe> yeah it definitely isn't a good approach.. was just showing him that the id needed to be changed or removed
[17:08:53] <blindMoe> hitesa: only hipsters
[17:09:18] <Eviltwin> blindMoe: s/changed or //
[17:09:38] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: true.. probably no need for an id on the new ones
[17:19:03] <digitalcakestudi> I'm using val on a check box but I always get "on" regardless it its checked or not
[17:19:56] <jrockjiggz> check value will get passed into the post data if checked

[17:24:07] <filipiz> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[17:24:26] <ngharo> NexHD: you want to delete but... don't... wat
[17:24:28] <sunbeam> a wordpress post, should this be inside an <article> ?
[17:26:44] <ansimation> anyone familiar with plupload and want to take a stab at why http://pastebin.com/yqESjrQ6 isn't firing the browse dialog? click 'select image' in the thumbnail box here http://97.97.254.70/tbd/leave-a-testimonial/ and it should fire the browse dialog
[17:27:38] <NexHD> i have unlimited span but first i want to show , and others i want to delete
[17:28:45] <ngharo> $('span').not(':first').remove()
[17:28:47] <ngharo> that maybe
[17:29:54] <NexHD> i will try it
[17:29:56] <NexHD> thanks
[17:30:02] <ngharo> np pal
[17:30:43] <NexHD> it works
[17:30:45] <NexHD> thanks
[17:57:58] <blindMoe> anyone have a trick for rounding to the nearest nth even decimal point ?
[18:00:51] <coldhead> ?eval ~~(1.12345678 * 1000) / 1000
[18:00:56] <bot-t> coldhead: 1.123
[18:01:00] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[18:01:01] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[18:01:14] <blindMoe> so now what about forcing it to end in an even number?
[18:01:34] <blindMoe> I am creating a grid on google maps and the grid lines must never land on an odd number
[18:02:53] <coldhead> ?eval x = 7; x % 2 === 1 ? x+1 : x;
[18:02:54] <bot-t> coldhead: 8
[18:03:00] <coldhead> something like that?
[18:03:34] <blindMoe> yeah that would work.. I would just have to cut off the last digit of the decimal to test it
[18:06:31] <asdf12> more JS question, how do i do write a regexp obj that includes a object string, like var str = 'hi'; /^-str-/ ?

[19:16:35] <azbyin> on a page, the only thing I have is an iframe within which a separate webpage is loaded. is it possible to access the toplevel page iframe attributes from within the js loaded in the iframe document?
[19:17:19] <delko> can anyone help?
[20:02:14] <Gabriel___> how do I make it so everything is collapsed by default so I dont have to run  $('.collapse').collapse({ on document.ready?
[20:11:36] <AlexWaters> does anyone know why my post isn't getting sent with this: http://jsfiddle.net/d9AfJ/7/
[20:12:05] <AlexWaters> i know I need to look into doing this with ajax - but time contraint...
[20:14:21] <filipiz> AlexWaters: it is submiting...
[20:14:21] <ML74> is it possible to use $.ajax to run a php function rather than a php script, and return a json object?
[20:14:58] <gchristensen> ML74: it could call a php script which calls the function and returns JSON via json_encode()
[20:15:09] <AlexWaters> filipiz: when I try to grab the post data with PHP -> nothing is being sent. If I remove the jquery it POSTS correctly
[20:15:14] <ML74> but it needs to be a script?
[20:15:45] <gchristensen> how else woudl you do it...
[20:16:18] <filipiz> AlexWaters: and how are you grabbing it? $_POST["name"] ?
[20:16:38] <AlexWaters> filipiz: yes
[20:16:50] <AlexWaters> if(isset($_POST['signupSubmit'])){ echo "blah"
[20:17:28] <gchristensen> AlexWaters: it might not be sending the submit button since you're not pressing that particular button.
[20:18:12] <filipiz> there are no fileld with name "signupSubmit" in your form...
[20:18:15] <AlexWaters> http://bit.ly/Q4E2DT to see the PHP
[20:18:16] <filipiz> field*
[20:18:33] <gchristensen> filipiz: pressing the submit button would send that field
[20:18:58] <filipiz> hmm
[20:20:46] <filipiz> well try to check for name and email, and not the submit input field.. i'm not sure why.. but maybe will solve your problem.. or ad any other hidden field with fixed value
[20:21:14] <gchristensen> you really should validate all the other fields anywa.
[20:22:56] <AlexWaters> filipiz: the other input fields are not being set, just checked. They are empty and give me an error
[20:23:19] <filipiz> hmm
[20:31:19] <azbyin> within an iframe how do I do something when it is ready?
[20:31:31] <azbyin> $(document).ready doesn;t seem to work within the iframe
[21:03:03] <Aristata> If I have some inputs with no form, am I able to serialize them as parameters for an ajax post?
[21:33:09] <danheberden> Aristata: you should be able to call serialize on any parent container
[21:33:38] <danheberden> you just lose the coolness of having them in a form, like when someone presses enter in an input
[21:33:53] <danheberden> thus why submit is often better to bind to
[21:33:55] <martisj> what method do i use if i want to select children further down in the DOM, than just the immediate children?
[21:33:58] <martisj> children() doesn't cut it.
[21:34:06] <danheberden> martisj see ?find
[21:34:06] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[21:34:06] <martisj> is it contents()/
[21:34:15] <martisj> danheberden: is find slow?
[21:34:24] <danheberden> martisj: i mean, slower than children obviously
[21:34:29] <danheberden> but nothing you need to worry about
[21:34:39] <martisj> danheberden: yepp okay thanks
[21:34:40] <danheberden> as long as you, like, aren't finding the same element a million times in a loop or something
[21:34:40] <martisj> :)
[21:34:49] <martisj> only finding one single item
[21:34:50] <martisj> :)
[21:34:57] <danheberden> then, ya, that nano second won't be noticed
[22:00:31] <versatiletech> ok who needs help
[22:00:46] <coldhead> with jQuery?
[22:00:58] <versatiletech> yeah
[22:01:02] <danheberden> i have this rash that hasn't gone away
[22:01:09] <versatiletech> aloe vera
[22:01:18] <coldhead> how do i make girls like me?
[22:01:27] <danheberden> and how do i make girls like coldhead?
[22:01:31] <versatiletech> get on their emotional side
[22:01:36] <coldhead> i tried "be yourself" but i keep getting arrested
[22:02:06] <danheberden> coldhead no luck getting those restraining orders lifted?
[22:02:17] <coldhead> the wheels of justice turn slowly
[22:02:23] <coldhead> i shall have my days in court
[22:02:35] <tw2113> coldhead, are you unable to use the $ alias legally?
[22:02:58] <versatiletech> tw2113: XD
[22:03:04] <tw2113> did the wheels of justice find you unsafe to use $
[22:03:32] <coldhead> they are on their way down that road
[22:03:56] <tw2113> coldhead: forever undefined
[22:04:33] <coldhead> hahahah
[22:08:18] <versatiletech> last call, anyone need jQuery help?
[22:08:30] <jrockjiggz> I dooo
[22:08:46] <versatiletech> ok shoot. What's the problem?
[22:09:22] <jrockjiggz> sorry.. I don't need anything atm ;) but thanks
[22:09:42] <tw2113> i need $
[22:09:46] <tw2113> alias it to me faster!
[22:09:50] <versatiletech> ehhh... okay
[22:10:12] <tw2113> otherwise, if you're going to bed, the room should probably be fine without you for a bit
[22:10:13] <versatiletech> tw2113: you can find a lot of $ in jquery.js
[22:10:22] <tw2113> hawt
[22:10:32] <versatiletech> yep
[22:10:45] <versatiletech> alrighty goodnight everyone
[22:12:34] * tw2113 still dreams of finding as many possible links as I can between freelancing/webdev and prowrestling, as i can
[22:12:48] <tw2113> oops, too many "as i can" in there
[22:17:58] <stan_man_can> Hey guys. I'm doing an ajax call to my server and it's on average giving me a 100-150ms connection time, and 100-150ms "waiting". Any way to speed either of these up?
[22:18:40] <stan_man_can> when i do the ajax call it's hitting a php script that does a curl request to another api that i wrote but the curl request total time is saying 3-4ms
[22:18:53] <snower> get a faster network connection.
[22:19:03] <matteu> stan_man_can: get a faster server, pass less data, receive less data
[22:19:26] <stan_man_can> matteu: i'm only passing 6 character string, and i'm only passing back about a 5-20 character string
[22:19:42] <stan_man_can> the curl request is saying it's only taking 3ms so i'm not sure where the extra time is coming from
[22:19:47] <stan_man_can> or how to find it :/
[22:20:33] <rhizmoe> is .find() a cromulent way to get a parent selector?
[22:26:30] <matteu> stan_man_can: the jQuery ajax calls are pretty straightforward without much room for low-level improvement.  If you think it's a jQuery issue, try making the AJAX call the traditional way, otherwise you're looking at a server optimization problem, and that's probably beyond the room scope
[22:27:43] <stan_man_can> matteu: I don't really think it's a jquery problem necessarily, just was curious if you guys could tell me where to look. Like I said, the CURL info is telling me it's total time is 4ms, yet chrome is telling me it was waiting 100ms for a response
[22:30:25] <stan_man_can> i guess that's not bad actually
[22:30:26] <matteu> stan_man_can: unfortunately AJAX is a lot of magic, so it's hard to tell.  I would probably try starting with googling ajax speed up techniques for whatever server you're using and application you might be working with.  You should also see if you can't profile the full script execution, and not just the cURL call, and see how long that is actually taking.  If the cURL call is slower because it's being run by an AJAX call, I'm not sure why, 
[22:31:21] <rhizmoe> stan_man_can: use firebug network panel
[22:31:25] <stan_man_can> matteu: Yeah the whole script is a curl call. I pass in a parameter, curl, and echo out the response
[22:32:33] <stan_man_can> I'm wondering if it's just network latency though. Even if chrome tell's me it's waiting 100ms for a response is literally 10ms more than between me and the server
[22:48:58] <rethus> i search a content-slider, which an handle divs with images, and other divs inside
[22:50:03] <tw2113> awesome
[22:53:18] <rethus> anny suggestion, which are easy to use?
[22:53:39] <tw2113> i like jquery cycle a lot
[22:57:46] <martisj_> how do i bind events to dynamically created elements with jquery
[22:58:31] <tw2113> ?bind
[22:58:32] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[22:58:36] <tw2113> maybe?
[22:58:47] <rethus> tw2113: but can this handle even <div> inside of the main-div "slideshow" ?
[23:00:30] <tw2113> check the last example on this page rethus http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/int2.html
[23:00:32] <Eviltwin> martisj_: see ?on and read the section about event delegation
[23:00:34] <bot-t> martisj_, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:00:59] <rethus> tw2113: great, thanks
[23:02:53] <rethus> tw2113: that plugin realy rocks... quite easy, but very impressively
[23:12:07] <martisj_> Eviltwin: thanks
[23:15:01] <rethus> tw2113: fx:fade works well, but if i switch to "scrollRight", the whole div disappear
[23:15:07] <rethus> any idea why
[23:15:22] <tw2113> nope
[23:15:30] <rethus> ah, found it
[23:15:43] <rethus> my wrapping div doesn't had a height
[23:39:36] <Clorith> When filtering throug ha table, I'm jumping between each <td> using .each(), but is there some way to get the name and value of the element inside the td when I don't know up front what kind of element it is, or should I just do an if check there? (it could be input fields or textareas)
[23:58:16] <Cork> Clorith: do you know that its a form element?
[23:58:34] <Cork> Clorith: and is there only one element in the td?
[23:59:41] <Clorith> Yes and yes :)
