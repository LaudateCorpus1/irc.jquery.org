[02:02:32] <jquio> I need to put a variable in a filter, like : all.filter(getFilter("VARIABLE"));
[02:03:07] <jquio> but how to have multiple variables? like: all.filter(getFilter("VARIABLE1, VARIABLE2, VARIABLE3..."));
[02:16:55] <Cork> jquio: you can't put a variable in a string
[02:17:39] <Cork> jquio: what you can do depends on getFilter so can't say without seeing its declaration
[02:20:12] <jquio> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ar3PY/92/
[02:20:43] <Cork> that function can't take more then one value
[02:20:54] <jquio> Cork: row 12 I have: var tgts = all.filter(getFilter("brand")).filter(getFilter("class")).filter(getFilter("color"));
[02:20:55] <Cork> it uses the argument as $("#filters ." + category + ":checked")
[02:21:12] <Cork> and that will break if you use more then one
[02:21:44] <jquio> can I have something like category* to read more?
[02:21:57] <Cork> doesn't matter, the use of category can't handle it
[02:22:42] <jquio> is it another way to do it?
[02:22:45] <jquio> to make it work
[02:22:49] <Cork> so ya, getFilter needs to be rewritten if you want it to take more then one category at a time
[02:23:08] <Cork> you can't without a rewrite of getFilter
[02:24:05] <jquio> I have a json that loop more tags, and I want them to read: so it can be like  all.filter(getFilter("tag1")).filter(getFilter("tag2")).filter(getFilter("tag3"));
[02:24:31] <jquio> and if I have a tag4, it will add .filter(getFilter("tag4"));
[02:24:31] <Cork> that would give you the rows that have all the tags
[02:24:49] <jquio> yes
[02:25:01] <jquio> all the tags in the loop :)
[02:38:43] <jquio> Cork: I have make it return the whole code in an alert : http://jsfiddle.net/ar3PY/98/
[02:39:35] <jquio> Cork so Line 24: var tgts = skolvFilterDataResult; should do that code, but not understand it is a jquery code, it think it is a textstring
[02:40:05] <jquio> how to make jquery read text as "code" ?
[02:40:09] <Cork> jquio: yes getFilter selects a set of checkboxes and then generates a comma separated string based on there values
[02:40:19] <Cork> if the string is empty it returns *
[02:40:30] <Cork> jquio: you can't fix it where you're trying to solve it
[02:40:38] <Cork> and you can't make a function return code
[02:41:34] <jquio> Cork: ok, is there any way to read all?
[02:41:50] <Cork> what does read all mean?
[02:42:07] <jquio> read all tags in my json
[02:42:28] <Cork> "your json"?
[02:42:51] <jquio> Cork: filterData on row 1
[02:43:04] <Cork> so filterData[0] ?
[02:43:11] <Cork> its just a string
[02:43:52] <jquio> http://jsfiddle.net/ar3PY/99/
[02:43:58] <jquio> var filterData = ["brand class color"];
[02:44:36] <Cork> jquio: do you have the slightest idea of what the code in this fiddle does?
[02:44:55] <Cork> or are you just copy pasting and asks around to get other to make it work?
[02:46:37] <jquio> This soloution is started from stackoverflow, but then I have make some changes
[02:46:52] <Cork> sure, but do you understand it?
[02:47:16] <jquio> yes
[02:47:24] <Cork> then go fix getFilter
[02:47:56] <Cork> make it take categories and then split the string up and do the selection and then generate a compound result string
[02:53:05] <shai2389> Hello, I'm using html input element as rounded progress bar, do you know how I can animate the value property when changed?
[02:54:49] <Cork> shai2389: an input as progress?
[02:54:55] <Cork> do you mean a <progress> element?
[02:55:37] <shai2389> Cork: yes..
[03:00:13] <Cork> shai2389: other then using something like .animation with step and changing the value from start to end i don't think so
[03:00:25] <Cork> the value isn't css so i don't think you can use transition
[03:01:24] <Cork> the simplest solution i can think of is to just use two nested divs and stop using progress (i've never seen the point of that element...)
[03:09:20] <Cork> shai2389: https://jsfiddle.net/dzt91L7j/1/
[05:46:28] <qiuo> how to set red color if there is more than 4 label for each box : https://jsfiddle.net/as0y3mr8/
[05:49:41] <Cork> qiuo: https://jsfiddle.net/as0y3mr8/1/
[05:51:04] <qiuo> Cork: thx :)
[05:51:51] <Koopz> how come my $.ajax() doesn't get executed whenever i try to pass authentication credentials to it?
[05:52:40] <Koopz> tried using username and password as params, tried setting the Authentication header, in both cases i won't see anything in my network tab
[05:53:04] <Koopz> if i remove that stuff, the request gets executed, returning a 41
[05:53:06] <Koopz> 401*
[06:00:15] <Cork> Koopz: depends on what you're trying to do
[06:00:22] <Cork> might be cross origin is blocking you
[06:00:49] <Koopz> i would've seen that in the console, but unfortunately there's no output at all
[06:01:12] <Cork> check the network tab so the credentials is sent correctly
[06:03:08] <Koopz> can't check because the request doesn't popup in the network tab
[06:03:37] <Cork> sounds like there is a silenced exception somewhere then
[06:05:17] <Uhkis> if you're sending those credentials as "user:pass@url", i hope it doesn't show up
[06:05:18] <Koopz> ...i just tried setting the Authorization header again... it works now...
[06:05:44] <Koopz> nah already found out that url: 'user:padd@foo.com' doesn't work :P
[06:06:03] <Cork> they need to be base64 encoded
[06:06:17] <Cork> but except for that, yes they are plane text
[06:06:18] <Koopz> did that
[06:06:34] <Cork> so you shouldn't use basic auth unless you use https
[06:06:50] <Cork> but you shouldn't ever have a login page that isn't so...
[06:07:04] <redCOAT_> :D
[06:07:31] <Koopz> eh i would've used an API key if this "Traccar" API would provide one
[06:07:51] <Cork> Koopz: doesn't make much difference
[06:08:12] <Cork> all that would do is have a separate password you can change without changing the "normal" password
[06:09:24] <Koopz> being able to request a new API key by authenticating via the current one sounds weird
[06:09:58] <Cork> Koopz: what are you doing when you change password for your facebook account? :D
[06:10:02] <Cork> its the exact same thing
[06:10:46] <Koopz> surely they won't let me change my login credentials when i used my API key for authentication instead of my actual password
[06:11:05] <Cork> ...
[06:11:09] <Cork> Koopz: your missing the point
[06:11:41] <Cork> the point is that api keys is just a separate password for the account that is server generated
[06:12:00] <Cork> sure they might limit what the account is allowed to do when you use the api key
[06:12:15] <Cork> but it is NOT in it self a safer way to access an account
[06:13:24] <Koopz> aren't you condraticting your own statement? it IS safer to use an API key BECAUSE your actions are limited when you use it instead of real credentials
[06:14:00] <Cork> Koopz: that statement is only true if the server code has "unless identified by api key" in there code
[06:14:06] <Cork> THAT is the point
[06:14:22] <Cork> api keys is only safer if the server actually reduces what the account is allowed to do
[06:14:26] <Cork> and many doesn't
[06:17:51] <Koopz> wouldn't that rather be called an "Authentication Token" instead of an API key (which should be only usable in combination with actual API endpoints anyways)
[06:18:30] <Cork> no, what you call the key you send has nothing to do with what restrictions the server does when it is used
[06:18:44] <Cork> api key is just "user this for automated api calls" that's it
[06:19:03] <Cork> and the reason is normally so if it get leaked you won't have to change the accounts normal password
[06:19:22] <Cork> that's it nothing else is done server side
[06:23:27] <Koopz> guess you must be speaking from experience :D i've never used software this crappy
[06:24:43] <qiuo> how to hide the last and only show the first 5 labels: https://jsfiddle.net/as0y3mr8/1/
[06:25:03] <qiuo> and have a read more button instead
[06:25:21] <Cork> Koopz: it isn't crappy, you're just assuming things happens server side i can tell you isn't at all related with "api key"
[06:26:39] <Koopz> requests with api keys usually don't end up returning you a cookie you can use for browsing around a site authenticated
[06:27:01] <Cork> Koopz: i never said it would
[06:27:03] <Koopz> if yes, then they're not api keys :D
[06:27:27] <Cork> but not returning a cookie doesn't mean it is a more restricted access to the account
[06:29:16] <prillian5> I use sortable of jquery-ui. I do an ajax-call inside the "receive"-callback of sortable. Problem is, cause of ajax connection is a bit slow, the drag&drop animation freeze till ajax-call is fullfilled.
[06:29:38] <Koopz> if the software processes API keys on requests to frontend-urls then the software is crappy :D
[06:29:38] <prillian5> Is there an method of sortable I could use, which is fired after the animation is finished?
[06:31:00] <Cyclohexane> if I copy the content of this contenteditable div and paste it, then the href changes from {{ link }} to https://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/%7B%7B%20link%20%7D%7D. Is there anyway to stop that? https://jsfiddle.net/mzgzjq05/

[07:02:55] <prillian5> got it. Was an unexpected value in "data" parameter
[07:48:45] <fn> @jquery158: https://jsfiddle.net/wt0eL0xp/5/
[07:48:49] <fn> something like this
[08:17:50] <Chulbul> http://jsfiddle.net/vVxM2/1372/ I'm trying to check if selected checkboxes increas certain limit or not. It's working, but when I refresh page and then by clicking shift plus checkbox upt more than 5 checkboxes, it getting failed.
[08:19:50] <liceoporova> ciao
[08:20:16] <Chulbul> Anybody?
[08:21:01] <Chulbul> I have created jsfiddle, please appreciate by helping me :D :p
[08:21:21] <jquery158> welcome to the queue
[08:22:45] <fn> @jquery158: do you read? i posted you a solution.
[08:25:08] <jquery158> yes i do, thought i posted, so i have another question now, how do i pull & append all the form data- attributes?
[08:25:16] <Cork> Chulbul: your $this and length is undefined
[08:25:38] <jquery158> i'm currently just serializing the form
[08:26:12] <Cork> Chulbul: ans never ever change the state from an event after an alert
[08:28:56] <Cork> Chulbul: http://jsfiddle.net/vVxM2/1373/
[08:29:30] <Cork> cleaner solution http://jsfiddle.net/vVxM2/1374/
[08:31:10] <Chulbul> Cork: Try to refresh it, and instead of checking one by one, click shift and then select first, and then 11th. They all are getting selected, but it should be blocked.
[08:31:50] <Cork> Chulbul: you can't change that by trying to bruteforce the plugin you would have to extend the multiselect plugin to do that
[08:32:56] <Chulbul> Cork: Oh, any suggetions on how to do that, I have never done that.? And what should be writen in that code, shift should be disabled or something else.
[08:33:08] <Cork> i've never used the plugin so no
[08:33:14] <Cork> open the source and read through it
[08:33:19] <Chulbul> Cork: Ok.
[08:33:24] <Chulbul> ty
[08:33:25] <Cork> it might have a plugin interface
[08:33:30] <Cork> else you will have to fork it
[08:33:37] <Chulbul> ok got it.
[08:37:18] <jquery158> Cork?
[08:37:45] <Chulbul> Cork: I have been also discussing this in javascript channel, one guy said: then you have to use the onChange option of the bootstrap multiselect library, instead of the dom change event. What are your thoughts on this?
[08:38:22] <Cork> Chulbul: if you're using the multiselect from bootstrap that could be exactly what you need ya
[08:38:36] <Chulbul> Ohk

[10:02:40] <Cork> don't ask ppl to debug a photo of the code...
[10:03:36] <Coolternet> ... seriously ... Cork... i send CODE and result in pic... i will not send 184 code line for only 10 lines of JQ
[10:04:03] <Cork> then don't expect ppl to help
[10:05:03] <jq> Omg people. Jq != jquery
[10:05:21] <Coolternet> mm mm... anyway 90% of my code is in PhP ... so JS Fiddles will not help anyone
[10:05:51] <Cork> jq: if that is bothering you, bad choice of a nick
[10:06:00] <jq> Cork: ikr
[10:06:28] <jq> It’s like people that shorten please to pls
[10:06:30] <jq> Like come on
[10:06:41] <jq> Add the uery at the end -_-
[10:06:43] <jq> lol
[10:06:58] <Cork> jq: heh ya, its irc typing takes time
[10:07:27] <jq> lol
[10:24:38] <jq> Coolternet: php just adds dynamic content to html. View source on your page and use that for the html section of a fiddle

[11:15:28] <taplar> look at your console
[11:19:12] <jq> poboy: Yeah. .select2() isn't a thing?
[11:19:18] <jq> Not sure wht you're trying to do there
[11:19:23] <taplar> it's a plugin
[11:20:08] <jq> Ahhh of course
[11:20:19] <jq> I always just reinvent the wheel when I make anything
[11:20:24] <jq> I hate more and more and more resources
[11:27:22] <poboy> so idDiv is undefined
[11:27:45] <taplar> you're not including the select2 plugin in that fiddle
[11:27:57] <taplar> it will error on line 4
[11:28:16] <taplar> as your console will reflect
[11:28:48] <Coolternet> damn taplar thx !
[11:28:57] <taplar> np
[11:29:41] <poboy> yeah, my console says cannot read property  replace of undefined
[11:30:09] <taplar> what fiddle?
[11:30:16] <poboy> idForm has a length but idDiv does not so I'm guessing the class name is the issue
[11:31:11] <taplar> i have some doubt that `closest(idForm +' .evEntry')` will work
[11:31:33] <taplar> you're trying to use a nesting selector as part of closest()
[11:31:43] <taplar> not sure that that is valid
[11:34:03] <taplar> yeah, that's not valid
[11:34:49] <poboy> alert(idEVDiv.length); returns 10
[11:35:14] <taplar> can you share your updated fiddle?
[11:35:36] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/dw7jp38c/1/
[11:35:46] <poboy> not sure why select2 is still throwing a fit on the fiddle
[11:35:57] <poboy> i added select2 css and js
[11:36:06] <taplar> "The select2('destroy') method was called on an element that is not using Select2."
[11:36:12] <taplar> pretty self explanitory
[11:37:24] <poboy> class="form-control select2 evService", class="form-control select2 evServiceProcessor"
[11:37:50] <poboy> the only 2 places where select2('destroy') is called
[11:38:05] <taplar> you're not initializing select2 on the elements
[11:38:32] <taplar> it can't destroy something it never created
[11:38:48] <taplar> thus the error
[11:39:13] <taplar> https://select2.org/getting-started/installation#initialize-select2
[11:44:29] <jq> taplar: I fixed that weird firefox shit
[11:44:35] <taplar> oh?
[11:44:38] <jq> Added "timeout: 60000" to the ajax call
[11:44:44] <taplar> :s
[11:44:46] <jq> Remember yesterday
[11:44:50] <taplar> so the first call wasn't terminating?
[11:44:57] <jq> I think so
[11:45:06] <jq> Not sure why though
[11:45:16] <taplar> you know, i wondered about that when you showed your headers and it had the Keep Alive in it
[11:45:39] <jq> But everything else terminates
[11:45:42] <jq> I don't get it
[11:45:47] <taplar> yeah, *shrug*
[11:46:01] <jq> And why only firefox?
[11:46:03] <jq> Cause it sucks :(
[11:46:13] <taplar> or, it's the only one following standards, lol
[11:47:29] <jq> Ermmmmmmmm true
[11:47:36] <jq> Well wait no
[11:47:45] <jq> It's the only one not following standards
[11:48:07] <jq> Meaning it's doing what it shoiud do, not what ever other browser auto corrects
[11:48:10] <taplar> idk, robert could probably speak to that more.  i know at one point FF was the browser that met most of the web standards, but the other browsers are catching up
[11:48:24] <jq> Lol what? firefox is like the most basic
[11:48:44] <taplar> 'basic'?
[11:48:45] <jq> Chrome and safari and stuff add so much nonsense to autocorrect like 903253 different possible mistakes
[11:48:53] <jq> Where firefox just says "fuck it, this is what's here"
[11:48:58] <taplar> right, auto correcting isn't 'standard'
[11:49:08] <jq> If 9/10 browsers correct something
[11:49:12] <jq> It's the standard
[11:49:14] <taplar> doesn't mean it's standard
[11:49:27] <taplar> expected != standard
[11:49:36] <taplar> developers should write their shit correctly
[11:49:43] <taplar> not rely on a browser to maybe fix it for them
[11:49:59] <taplar> imho
[11:50:23] <jq> Why does every browser need to have it's own prefix to css options
[11:50:32] <jq> It pisses me off to have to do like -moz- -o- -webkit-
[11:50:33] <jq> Lol
[11:50:43] <jq> Why don't they all standardize
[11:50:45] <jq> Is that a word?
[11:50:49] <taplar> they do eventually
[11:51:02] <taplar> once they have it ironed out and what not
[11:51:19] <taplar> while they are still working on it and maybe improving their implemention on it, they prefix it, i believe is the reason
[11:51:28] <taplar> or if it is non-standard

[12:43:46] <TrevorBradley> Hey folks. I'm having an issue where hover's handlerOut is being called just before I middle click on a link inside the hover's div... meaning I can't middle click on a link on a div that's being hovered over.  Any ideas how to solve this?
[12:44:31] <TrevorBradley> I tried using a .delay in the .css('display','none') - it doesn't seem to have any effect.
[12:50:09] <taplar> can you show us a fiddle with what you have?
[12:52:22] <TrevorBradley> taplar: hold on, I think I've got it with .queue(50)
[12:52:38] <TrevorBradley> rather .delay(50).queue(function() {...});
[12:52:49] <taplar> delay() is for anomations
[12:52:51] <taplar> animations
[12:53:16] <TrevorBradley> Yes, except I need to queue up the display.none so that it runs after the middle click has a chance to execute.
[12:53:41] <TrevorBradley> Wondering if this is a chrome specific glitch
[12:53:58] <taplar> a delay for a non-animation based action would be a use of setTimeout
[12:54:17] <TrevorBradley> Yes, except setTimeout is difficult to pass $(this) into context.
[12:54:23] <TrevorBradley> This is working now.
[12:54:23] <taplar> lol
[12:55:11] <TrevorBradley> Dunno... it feels like hover handlerOut is executing out of sequence...
[12:55:13] <rjCousineau> Is there a way to read outside the sandbox in chrome extension? I want a settings.txt to determine the plugins behavior
[12:55:36] <TrevorBradley> Anyways, working now, moving on. Thanks taplar.
[12:56:46] <taplar> rjCousineau: not really a jQuery question.  you might ask ##javascript
[12:57:26] <rjCousineau> thanks
[12:57:58] <robertmaxrees> or #chromium
[12:58:06] <rjCousineau> cheers
[14:27:56] <Al_nz1> I have a webpage that I call a dashboard but its really just a list paginated of certain attributes in a ViewModel. At the top of the list is the option to select a region. If you select a different region a different list is displayed (same format but different results). I assume this is the sort of thing best done by AJAX?
[14:30:08] <taplar> how much of the page would you say is the list?
[14:30:58] <Al_nz1> 90%
[14:31:14] <codecutter> error fooObj.types.toString().replaceAll(',','<span class="dot"></span>');
[14:31:17] <taplar> and you already have the logic on the backend to build the initial results?
[14:31:36] <Al_nz1> taplar: yes there is a service to build the results etc
[14:31:38] <codecutter> ....toString(...).replaceAll is not a function
[14:31:57] <taplar> Al_nz1: if that's the case i'd probably say just do a form submit
[14:32:04] <taplar> reuse that logic
[14:32:16] <taplar> unless you have a reason to switch to ajax in that case
[14:32:24] <taplar> codecutter: try replace()
[14:32:42] <Al_nz1> does that mean I need to have a "submit" button or can it still be done with $('.whatever').on('change'.... ?
[14:32:49] <taplar> the latter
[14:32:57] <robertmaxrees> codecutter you want to replace all isntances of a character?
[14:33:01] <robertmaxrees> *instances
[14:33:31] <codecutter> yes, place the substitute should be html element (above just prints the span tag)
[14:33:36] <codecutter> plus*
[14:33:55] <robertmaxrees> codecutter can you show a fiddle?
[14:34:06] <codecutter> bruh!
[14:34:10] <codecutter> come on man
[14:34:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:34:26] <taplar> 'just prints the span tag' doesn't tell us what you are doing
[14:34:29] <codecutter> you want a fiddle for that?
[14:34:33] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[14:34:45] <taplar> by default, replace() doesn't change the original
[14:35:00] <robertmaxrees> also: you want a global regex search for the character you want to replace.
[14:35:07] <taplar> ^
[14:35:14] <codecutter> i need something like replaceAll
[14:35:17] <taplar> /g
[14:35:23] <taplar> //g
[14:35:26] <taplar> silly chat
[14:35:34] <robertmaxrees> codecutter again
[14:35:50] <codecutter> ok, 1 sec
[14:35:53] <robertmaxrees> you need a global regex search for the character you want to replace
[14:38:46] <robertmaxrees> codecutter https://jsfiddle.net/myakjonm/
[14:38:48] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff
[14:44:31] <Melissa11> Can someone please help me out
[14:44:37] <Melissa11> https://thepasteb.in/p/Q1hBj1MxnkRi8
[14:44:55] <Melissa11> This jquery is targeting *only* the very first #firstWord div on the page
[14:45:04] <robertmaxrees> Melissa11 well yeah
[14:45:06] <Melissa11> I need to have it target every div with the firstWord class
[14:45:07] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs
[14:45:11] <robertmaxrees> that';s not a class.
[14:45:13] <robertmaxrees> that's an ID
[14:45:16] <Melissa11> Oh
[14:45:21] <Melissa11> As long as I make it a class
[14:45:23] <Melissa11> It'll work?
[14:45:25] <robertmaxrees> '.firstword'
[14:45:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[14:45:30] <Melissa11> Thanks a lot
[14:45:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:45:36] <codecutter> how do place foo[] at moo[2]?
[14:45:40] <codecutter> do i*
[14:45:43] <codecutter> make sense?
[14:45:51] <taplar> no
[14:45:54] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:46:01] <codecutter> ok, my bad
[14:46:02] <robertmaxrees> codecutter is 'foo' an array
[14:46:03] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:46:07] <codecutter> yes
[14:46:11] <Melissa11> robertmaxrees I've changed it
[14:46:21] <codecutter> foo[] <-- sorry i was using java terminology
[14:46:23] <Melissa11> But it's still only happening at the very first instance of the .firstWord div
[14:46:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:46:35] <robertmaxrees> Melissa11 do all those divs have that class?
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> codecutter moo[2] = foo ?
[14:47:02] <Melissa11> Yep
[14:47:08] <taplar> Melissa11: can you update your paste.  i don't see where you are looping
[14:47:26] <robertmaxrees> ah yeah, .contents() just does the first one.
[14:47:44] <Melissa11> https://thepasteb.in/p/AnhrAKL85GrSv
[14:47:48] <Melissa11> What should I change it to?
[14:47:49] <codecutter> will that shift the existing moo[2] element down?
[14:47:59] <robertmaxrees> codecutter nope.
[14:48:13] <robertmaxrees> Melissa11 back up a sec.
[14:48:16] <robertmaxrees> what is this tryignt o do here?
[14:48:19] <codecutter> ok, how need a push on that element
[14:48:25] <codecutter> i need*
[14:48:33] <Melissa11> Wrap every first two letters in a .firstWord div in a span
[14:48:42] <Melissa11> So I can style these two letter differently robertmaxrees
[14:48:58] <Melissa11> They are being output through a plugin so I can't do it manually
[14:49:03] <robertmaxrees> codecutter you use .push(), but that's not what you're asking :) you want to know how to shift an index as well as all subsequent indices +1
[14:49:45] <codecutter> i do indeed, smart man :)
[14:49:54] <taplar> Melissa11: you are most likely going to have to do something with jQuery(".firstWord").each( ... ) to perform your action on each one
[14:49:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up ##javascript for that one.
[14:50:25] <codecutter> i can add it manually
[14:50:28] <codecutter> nvm
[14:50:31] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:50:39] <codecutter> moo[0] = val1
[14:50:44] <codecutter> moo[1] = val2
[14:50:46] <codecutter> etc
[14:51:14] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're trying to sort the array.
[14:51:59] <taplar> codecutter: https://davidwalsh.name/array-insert-index
[14:52:07] <codecutter> actually that wont work
[14:53:13] <robertmaxrees> that splice trick would do it.
[14:56:37] <codecutter> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object -> 'if (typeof Object.keys(timeSeries) !== 'undefined' && Object.keys(timeSeries).length > 0) {'
[14:56:53] <codecutter> var timeSeries = response['(Daily)'];
[14:57:09] <codecutter> sometimes it works, other times it fails
[14:57:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the data.
[14:57:16] <taplar> typeof Object.keys(timeSeries) !== 'undefined' <-- this looks weird
[14:57:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:58:00] <taplar> wouldn't that just be typeof timeSeries === 'object' or something?
[14:58:07] <codecutter> ajax response - https://pastebin.com/T3zeMZLa
[14:58:40] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:58:50] <robertmaxrees> timeSeries = response['(Daily)'];
[14:59:04] <codecutter> i shortened it
[14:59:08] <robertmaxrees> given that dataset, that wouldn't work./
[14:59:11] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[14:59:14] <taplar> lol
[14:59:15] <robertmaxrees> did you shorten the code?
[14:59:27] <robertmaxrees> why are you asking for help, telling us there are errors, and then not giving us the actual code??
[14:59:48] <codecutter>  var timeSeries = fchi['Time Series (Daily)'];
[15:00:14] <robertmaxrees> and what are you trying to do with taht typeof dealio?
[15:00:23] <codecutter> lol
[15:00:41] <robertmaxrees> broseph.
[15:01:00] <robertmaxrees> you're asking questions, giving us incomplete info, and then acting like we're being unreasonable.,
[15:01:11] <robertmaxrees> really hard to help when we can't get even a try at a test case.
[15:01:17] <codecutter> let me get you the full thing
[15:01:19] <codecutter> sorry
[15:01:19] <robertmaxrees> we can't see what you see - only what you give us.
[15:02:59] <taplar> also this json object isn't what you were calling an 'array' is it?
[15:03:14] <codecutter> https://pastebin.com/h0SJnjPq
[15:03:32] <codecutter> here is the response format https://pastebin.com/T3zeMZLa
[15:03:55] <taplar> i want a browser plugin that will auto insert /raw in pastebin links....
[15:04:42] <taplar> so what do these two pastes have to do with arrays?
[15:04:51] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[15:05:08] <codecutter> tapler https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=MSFT&apikey=demo
[15:05:09] <robertmaxrees> and what's the goal with if (typeof Object.keys(timeSeries) !== 'undefined' && Object.keys(timeSeries).length > 0)  ?
[15:05:20] <taplar> or just tell me dude
[15:05:23] <taplar> seriously
[15:05:55] <codecutter> well, i was hoping you can tell me why i'm getting that error
[15:06:04] <codecutter> on that line
[15:06:25] <robertmaxrees> codecutter so i keep asking what the goal is there so I can help give you the right solution.
[15:06:34] <robertmaxrees> being vague isn't helping anybody
[15:07:10] <codecutter> ok, what the solution?
[15:07:14] <codecutter> whats*
[15:07:15] <robertmaxrees> ......
[15:07:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't know - you won't tell me what you're trying to accomplish.
[15:07:38] <codecutter> that line is supposed to catch that error
[15:07:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with this data?
[15:07:52] <codecutter> which obviously fails
[15:08:02] <robertmaxrees> you were asking about arrays earlier, but there aren't any arrays here.  was that related?
[15:08:41] <codecutter> place the part "Time Series (Daily)": {} in a object
[15:08:53] <taplar> it's already in an object
[15:09:00] <robertmaxrees> you want it in another object?
[15:09:05] <codecutter> that should be obvious.. line 9
[15:09:21] <taplar> line 9 has nothing to do with it's structure
[15:09:21] <codecutter> tapler< right
[15:09:23] <robertmaxrees> if it's obvious, we wouldn't be asking.
[15:09:28] <taplar> the response shows it's all object
[15:09:50] <codecutter> tapler: thats not the actual response, that just a format sample
[15:09:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/3kfczsrk/1/
[15:09:58] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[15:10:00] <taplar> -_-
[15:10:01] <codecutter> sometimes it works and sometimes i get that error
[15:10:17] <taplar> what does that error say?
[15:10:27] <robertmaxrees> that measn your time series propery doesn't exist or the response format is bad.
[15:10:33] <taplar> ^
[15:10:51] <robertmaxrees> console.log() out the response and get the error to trigger and look.
[15:11:33] <codecutter> that may be a the best option
[15:11:38] <codecutter> i'll try that
[15:20:45] <codecutter> i need a single array (not array inside an array) https://fiddle.jshell.net/14jdczyr/
[15:20:56] <codecutter> current output is : onetwo,three,fourfivefive
[15:21:07] <codecutter> i'm after onetwothreefourfivefive
[15:21:37] <codecutter> first one calls .toString() in position 1, hence the ','
[15:21:57] <codecutter> trying to merge both array into a single array
[15:22:06] <codecutter> hope that make sense
[15:22:13] <robertmaxrees> you want to merge two arrays?
[15:22:35] <codecutter> second array has to be in one[1]
[15:23:17] <taplar> it is
[15:23:32] <taplar> https://fiddle.jshell.net/14jdczyr/1/
[15:23:36] <robertmaxrees> wat.  you said you want to merge the two arrays, now you're saying you want the second array in index 1...
[15:24:52] <robertmaxrees> could you maybe explain what you're going to do with these two arrays?>
[15:25:03] <robertmaxrees> like,m what's the end result you're looking for, getting away from the data.
[15:25:24] <codecutter> tapler, no commas
[15:25:34] <robertmaxrees> .join('')
[15:25:47] <taplar> look at the console
[15:26:05] <taplar> instead of forcing it to text on the page to see what it is, -look- at what it is
[15:27:12] <codecutter> tapler: i need to append the array to the page...
[15:27:40] <codecutter> it shows the ',' on append
[15:27:44] <taplar> which is a different issue than seeing if it is inserted into the array how you want it
[15:28:24] <taplar> because if all you are after is a flat array that gets joined by ',', inserting the array into the other array like that is counter productive
[15:28:46] <codecutter> i have a mustcahe html template when is taking each element in array and rendering in <li>element</li>
[15:29:08] <codecutter> which*
[15:29:13] <taplar> does that mustache template take into account if an element is an array?
[15:29:22] <codecutter> no
[15:29:29] <taplar> so you are constructing that array incorrectly
[15:29:37] <codecutter> right
[15:29:43] <taplar> lol, dude.
[15:29:52] <taplar> robert asked if you wanted the elements in the array, not the array in the array
[15:30:09] * robertmaxrees shrugs
[15:30:13] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure i don't exist any more.
[15:30:18] <codecutter> i can do a join() but that will just add to the tails of the first array
[15:30:28] <robertmaxrees> because that's not what you want.
[15:30:38] <codecutter> i need the second array to be in a specific position of array 1
[15:30:56] <taplar> which you -cant- have as your template logic doesn't expect that
[15:31:05] <codecutter> which is then flattened to be a single array
[15:31:18] <taplar> you clearly know what you want.  so go write it
[15:33:24] <grapheti> https://i.imgur.com/5HFxNj6.png
[15:33:48] <taplar> a frog drinking burbon
[15:34:02] <grapheti> LOL
[15:34:08] * robertmaxrees 's pedantic nature intensifies
[15:34:28] <robertmaxrees> obviously it's a lizard drinking bourbon
[15:34:57] <codecutter> thats tea, your idiots!
[15:35:00] <taplar> wait, i thought amphibians were mammals
[15:35:00] <codecutter> you*
[15:35:17] <grapheti> you're*
[15:36:34] <taplar> nvm, interesting
[15:36:45] <codecutter> anyway, $.merge seems to work like charm
[15:37:28] <codecutter> but its not in the order i want
[15:38:09] <taplar> looping over the second array to insert into the first, starting at position 1 and incrementing should get you want you want
[15:38:29] <taplar> conceptually
[15:41:59] <codecutter> yea
[15:42:16] <codecutter> i'm justing going $.merge and be done with it
[15:42:17] <codecutter> thanks
[15:42:33] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[15:42:39] * taplar shrugs
[15:42:45] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[15:46:45] <grapheti> it's like spaghetti, whatever sticks, sticks
[15:47:15] <taplar> what terrible cuisine have you been eating?
[15:47:20] * taplar cries for grapheti
[15:47:22] <grapheti> lmao
[15:47:27] <robertmaxrees> hahahahhaa
[15:47:30] <robertmaxrees> aces
[15:47:34] <grapheti> :D
[15:48:32] <taplar> i think you missed our poo webgl skit yesterday around 17:00
[15:49:03] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't say I "missed" it ;D
[15:49:32] <taplar> eh, it was kinda dark
[15:49:40] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[15:51:35] <Ziberius> hello
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[15:51:52] <taplar> how!
[15:52:07] * taplar has decided to incorporate native american steriotypes into his greetings
[15:53:00] <Ziberius> any idea why when setting a text on a <h4> tag with .text("example") the html codes like &oacute; are not shown correctly?
[15:53:17] <taplar> it doesn't encode them
[15:53:36] <taplar> it creates a TextNode that the dom renders only as text
[15:53:40] <Ziberius> taplar: any idea of a workaround?
[15:53:55] <taplar> ummm, possibly encodeURIComponent?
[15:53:57] <robertmaxrees> Ziberius use .html()
[15:53:59] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[15:54:17] <Ziberius> .html great thanx! :-D
[15:54:21] <taplar> or wait.  do you want it to render as html?
[15:54:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:54:33] <taplar> nvm, i misunderstood
[15:54:34] <robertmaxrees> good question.
[15:54:39] <Ziberius> taplar: I just want to set a text content
[15:55:00] <Ziberius> no html
[15:55:09] <taplar> do you want &oacute; to be visible like that, or to render?
[15:55:13] <Ziberius> to render
[15:55:17] <taplar> html()
[15:55:22] <Ziberius> great thanx! :-D
[15:55:41] * taplar notes the correct spelling is 'hau'
[15:56:05] <grapheti> dem dark poos
[15:56:38] <taplar> look, grapheti.  you may disagree with their political stances, but calling democrats poo is hardly necessary
[15:57:12] <grapheti> I ain't votin' repooblican either
[15:57:23] <taplar> lmao, nice
[15:57:30] <grapheti> :P
[15:58:18] <taplar> Hau, Mitakuyepi!  == Greetings, Friend!
[15:59:12] <taplar> http://indians.org/welker/greeting.htm   crazy long words
[16:00:01] <grapheti> I know. I live in Oklahoma.
[16:01:12] <taplar> i think i'll stick with hau.  I now know hau
[16:01:42] <grapheti> How do you say "Here's your land back. Psyche!" ?
[16:02:06] <taplar> i only know the sign language for that.  oddly it's a single finger
[16:02:14] <grapheti> lmao
[16:05:42] <taplar> huh, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_(greeting) is kinda saying some would use it more to end their speech, rather than to start
[16:16:41] <grapheti> that's just what they say to white people
[16:27:38] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:28:37] <grapheti> I don't speak Jamaican.
[16:54:54] <funkeesapien> hey guys
[16:55:10] <taplar> hello
[16:55:27] <funkeesapien> is there a way to make the shake method less 'intense'?
[16:55:44] <taplar> shake method?
[16:55:48] <funkeesapien> yea
[16:55:53] <funkeesapien> https://api.jqueryui.com/shake-effect/
[16:55:58] <funkeesapien> taplar: looks like i can set distance
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> i was about to ask... "intense"?
[16:56:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:56:18] <funkeesapien> taplar: is calling it a method not the right nomenclature?
[16:56:33] <taplar> i wasn't aware of the ui option
[16:56:49] <robertmaxrees> ^ we just don't hear about ui much these days haha
[16:56:57] <funkeesapien> ok so i have learned somehing in the last 6 months lol
[16:57:15] <funkeesapien> robertmaxrees: these days?
[16:57:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:57:43] <taplar> lots of logic questions, jquery questions, data tables questions, etc.
[16:57:49] <taplar> not a lot of ui questions
[16:57:49] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap.
[16:58:03] <funkeesapien> does bootstrap do animations?
[16:58:24] <taplar> personally i'd try to do the animation with pure css if possible
[16:58:27] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[16:58:37] <funkeesapien> why is that?
[16:58:42] <funkeesapien> performance?
[16:58:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:58:54] <robertmaxrees> CSS animations are generally much more performant.
[16:58:58] <robertmaxrees> for a variety of reasons.
[16:59:07] <funkeesapien> assuming i'm already using the ui library for other stuff as well
[16:59:24] <funkeesapien> is it okay to do the animation with jquery?
[16:59:35] <funkeesapien> or you would still say CSS
[16:59:40] <taplar> css all the way
[16:59:45] <funkeesapien> aw man
[16:59:45] <robertmaxrees> ^ tho
[16:59:48] <robertmaxrees> tbh
[16:59:50] <robertmaxrees> it really depends.
[17:00:00] <funkeesapien> assuming the device was made in the last 3 years
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:00:08] <funkeesapien> ?
[17:00:12] <funkeesapien> lol
[17:00:20] <funkeesapien> i think it's ok
[17:00:21] <robertmaxrees> and document complexity, if you're seeing perf issues, etc.
[17:00:21] <funkeesapien> thanks guys
[17:01:57] <taplar> like a shake effect would be just some steps with some transitions of translateX
[17:02:17] <robertmaxrees> he's already gone.
[17:02:22] <taplar> noooo!
[17:02:27] <taplar> i was gonna plug animate css
[17:02:54] <robertmaxrees> he was looking for any reason to not switch anyway.
[17:03:06] <taplar> heh
[17:21:36] <stan_man_can> Using select2, select boxes are being populated with .select2({data: **json**})
[17:22:01] <stan_man_can> if serverside validation fails i return to the form with the error messages, i also still have the old values for each one
[17:22:16] <stan_man_can> how can I go about re-selecting the old values so the user doesn'thave to start from scratch?
[18:02:45] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can so you need to set the selected value?
[18:03:08] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: yeah
[18:04:21] <robertmaxrees> https://select2.org/programmatic-control/add-select-clear-items#selecting-an-option
[18:05:15] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: ah...
[18:05:20] <stan_man_can> so I have to populate then select
[18:06:13] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: any idea about how to work with the multiple boxes?
[18:11:01] <robertmaxrees> select each one and set its value >.>
[18:11:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the confusion is.
[18:13:44] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: just not sure how to select multiples
[18:14:05] <stan_man_can> if I loop through and do a $("#students").val($student) on each one it will only select the last one
[18:14:18] <robertmaxrees> "only select the last one" what?
[18:14:29] <robertmaxrees> I can't see your code so I have no frame of reference heh.
[18:14:54] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: https://kopy.io/S0dRL
[18:15:22] <stan_man_can> a stack overflow post seems to say you can pass an array into .val() so maybe i'll give that a try
[18:15:53] <taplar> are you repeating the 'students' id?
[18:16:08] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: $("#students").val(@json(old('students'))).trigger("change"); works
[18:16:45] <stan_man_can> old('students') just returns a php array of id's
[18:16:59] <stan_man_can> @json just spits out json based on the php array
[18:17:10] <stan_man_can> so in the end it's just doing $("#students").val([1,2,3]);
[18:17:27] <stan_man_can> $("#students").val([1,2,3]).trigger('change'); **
[18:17:32] <stan_man_can> thanks for the help all
[18:17:40] <stan_man_can> all being robertmaxrees
[18:17:43] <stan_man_can> lol
[18:18:15] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:18:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to select whatever that value was.
[18:18:22] <robertmaxrees> manually.
[18:18:30] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: that's what I'm doing there
[18:18:40] <stan_man_can> old('students') returns the previously selected options
[18:19:43] <robertmaxrees> are you using a multiselect?
[18:19:48] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: yes
[18:19:58] <stan_man_can> <select id="students" name='students[]' class="form-control" multiple="multiple"></select>3
[18:20:01] <stan_man_can> -3
[18:20:09] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[18:20:13] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: it's working
[18:20:29] <robertmaxrees> so no more issues?
[18:20:47] <stan_man_can> yup
[18:20:57] <robertmaxrees> oh, rad./
[18:20:59] <robertmaxrees> glad to hear then!
[18:21:10] <stan_man_can> sorry i didn't communicate that very well
[18:21:28] <stan_man_can> but we're all good; thanks again as usual
