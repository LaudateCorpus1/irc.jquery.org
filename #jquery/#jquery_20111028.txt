[00:20:16] <Xotix> If i have content which changes via JS, does it make more sense to applie the related css directly by js or is it better to defined a css file and trigger that with js? if it is a bit more of css.

[01:40:33] <bJake> Hi, I'm quite new to JQuery. I'm trying to use some simple fading techniques. Now my question is: is it possible to fadeOut a parent object and fadeIn a child of it in the callback? Because I can't get it to work.
[01:40:44] <Xotix> please open http://tinyw.in/XK60 and firebug. as you see, ready get's called several times. If i exclude inlineEditor.js it is fine.

[01:46:27] <Thomas`-> "easingA string indicating which easing function to use for the transition" .. when i put in my function name nothing happens

[01:47:20] <Xotix> Can please someone help me on that? http://tinyw.in/zunS i can't find anything related to that
[01:57:32] <deebo> how should i pass weird parameters to $.ajax? e.g.: "map['key']": value
[02:13:26] <apfrod> anyone know a good link for explaining how/why jquery sets height attribute for elements in IE?
[02:17:59] <ravenzz> apfrod when it is supposed to do that?
[02:22:01] <deebo> hmm apparently { a: { b: 'c' }†} ajax data gets serialized into a[b] = c
[02:22:18] <deebo> any idea how to format it differently? i need a['b']
[02:24:35] <Murugaratham> is there anyway to make the next page load a javascript resource?
[02:29:57] <apfrod> ravenzz: don't know but it does
[02:30:05] <apfrod> ravenzz: that's what i'm trying to understand
[02:30:07] <ravenzz> can you provide a demo?
[02:30:47] <ravenzz> ?getScript @ Murugaratham
[02:30:48] <bot-t> Murugaratham, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[02:32:15] <Murugaratham> ravenzz, if i need to transfer the user to a page which i can't control?
[02:32:24] <Murugaratham> is using an iframe the only way?
[02:32:53] <ravenzz> if you can't control the page, you can't inject js
[02:32:54] <ravenzz> there
[02:33:06] <Murugaratham> even using iframe?
[02:33:32] <ravenzz> yep
[02:33:43] <Murugaratham> oh
[02:34:30] <ravenzz> think at your user is redirected to a onlinebanking website and you can inject  js there :p
[02:34:48] <Gozzy82> $(function(){ //dosomething }); is shorthand for $(document).ready(function () {//do something }); right or is there a difference?
[02:36:53] <Murugaratham> im customising something from microsoft sharepoint, putting my own js inside will void their gold support..
[02:36:55] <Murugaratham> pain in the arse
[02:38:21] <ravenzz> yep that's a shorthand
[02:38:27] <ravenzz> Gozzy82 ^
[02:38:36] <Gozzy82> thx ravenzz

[02:49:07] <ravenzz> yamahaalex37 I do
[02:52:38] <juria_roberts> heyy I am facing a problem
[02:52:40] <juria_roberts> http://pastie.org/2772222
[02:53:31] <ravenzz> juria_roberts you are doing that wrong
[02:53:48] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: how do I do it?
[02:57:47] <Aamir> ?inline @juria_roberts
[02:57:47] <bot-t> juria_roberts, don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
[02:58:47] <ravenzz> juria_roberts http://jsfiddle.net/9csKY/
[03:00:32] <ravenzz> juria_roberts this is more kewl http://jsfiddle.net/9csKY/1/
[03:03:47] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: thanks
[03:06:44] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: that wont work for me
[03:06:50] <ravenzz> why?
[03:07:00] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: i need to pass some other jquery object to a function
[03:07:26] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: as an argument
[03:08:03] <ravenzz> so $('#foo') is the element you are going to hide
[03:08:12] <ravenzz> would you pass it as argument?
[03:08:17] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: in my code input is not the input tag
[03:08:37] <ravenzz> so show me the real code instead
[03:09:05] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: ok
[03:11:07] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: http://pastebin.com/8yPcepsC
[03:11:26] <juria_roberts> line 1 to 26 is the one you should see
[03:14:28] <ravenzz> no man I am too lazy to look at that huge amount of code
[03:14:28] <ravenzz> lol
[03:15:28] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: but isnt how i did it correct for passing objects into functions
[03:38:08] <yan__nick> hey guys, why i'm getting always the last article ? http://jsfiddle.net/Sewbb/
[03:38:19] <yan__nick> only the last article is opened after click
[03:41:30] <alexandernst> I'm doing a loop and inside that loop a $('#my_div_' + i).bind("click", function(){ alert(i) }); but only the last div will trigger the alert. What's wrong?
[03:42:44] <alexandernst> (and yes, i is changing it's value after every iterate)
[03:44:34] <Aamir> yan__nick:  http://jsfiddle.net/Sewbb/1/

[03:48:54] <Aamir> xontech:  wrap what?
[03:49:13] <Aamir> and tr inside a td ?
[03:49:25] <Aamir> ops
[03:49:29] <Aamir> sorry xontech
[03:49:34] <Aamir> Xotix: ^
[03:49:43] <Xotix> no. i get something and want to wrap a tr and a td around it
[03:49:51] <Xotix> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/ liek it is done with the div
[03:50:21] <Aamir> Xotix:  $(something).wrap('<tr><td></td></tr>') may be :S
[03:51:57] <Xotix> yeah= i tried stuff liek that but probably wrong im gonna try it again, thanks.
[03:52:19] <krambiorix> hi guys
[03:53:07] <krambiorix> i try to change the id of a input element by doing this: uploadRow.find('#usersformessagearear'+custs[i].value).attr('id','usersformessagearear'+custs[i].value+index);  when i try to alert its value after the change it says that the element is undefined... Any ideas?
[03:53:19] <HardPhuck> anyone knows a simple wysiwyg that only has like bold, italic and underline... nothing else
[03:53:35] <Xotix> HardPhuck:  you can specify that
[03:53:39] <alexandernst> Aamir: well, this one is kind of working (not the way I want it, but at least it will trigger the click for every button): http://jsfiddle.net/5j4rH/  Anyways, as you can see, the alert always shows "5" instead the value of "i" on each loop.
[03:54:38] <Xotix> HardPhuck: on tinyMCE
[03:55:03] <HardPhuck> that's the thing, don't want to load whole tinyMCE for three buttons
[03:55:12] <alexandernst> Aamir: I know I can pass values with an array before the function definition, but I really want it this way.
[03:55:48] <Aamir> alexandernst:  only num is not a valid value for id attribute
[03:56:17] <alexandernst> Aamir: ok, update the page. I fixed that + I added another function
[03:56:18] <Aamir> alexandernst:  what is      <input type=button id="id-1" value="1"></>       ?
[03:56:22] <krambiorix> anyone?
[03:57:06] <alexandernst> Aamir: nothing. That is just an example. My real code will iterate over a few divs and bind them the "click" event. But actually only the last one will trigger the alert.
[03:57:53] <Aamir> alexandernst:  http://jsfiddle.net/5j4rH/3/
[03:58:32] <burzum> $(this).parent('div.work-history').remove(); when this is triggered on the first of my work-history elements all of them below the container with this class disappear also - why? :(
[03:58:38] <Aamir> alexandernst:  its      <input type=button id="id-1" value="1"/> not   <input type=button id="id-1" value="1"></>
[03:59:09] <Aamir> ?parents @burzum
[03:59:09] <bot-t> burzum, .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[03:59:21] <alexandernst> Aamir: no, you didn't get it. I don't want to show an alert with the value of the div. That was just en example.
[03:59:30] <Aamir> burzum: s with parent?
[04:00:00] <Aamir> alexandernst:  than what u want
[04:00:05] <burzum> Aamir, hm?
[04:00:09] <alexandernst> Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/5j4rH/4/ look at this example.
[04:00:44] <alexandernst> Aamir: I want to bind a "click" event on each button (it's working on this example, but not on my code).
[04:01:05] <alexandernst> Aamir: and also, the alert is showing always "5", I want it to show the value of "i" for each loop
[04:02:39] <alexandernst> Aamir: So, clicking on the button "1" will trigger an alert with the text "1", because the var "i" had the value "1" on the first itteration. The id of the button doesn't matters at all.
[04:15:13] <jqueryhelpplease> can someone please help me with resize of a dive upon removing content of that div

[04:19:27] <Gozzy82> yourReference should be '#divId' or some oher reference and somevalue should be '100px' or '50%'..

[04:33:00] <Myx0x3> about this .data() seems not to work for me, im trying to set an data value, but it seems not to apply to the html code..
[04:34:12] <Gozzy82> Myx0x3 .data is not visible in the html code
[04:34:21] <Myx0x3> ooh
[04:34:53] <Myx0x3> anyways, it does not work, im trying to alert() it out but seems not to work! :/
[04:36:11] <Gozzy82> it does work your doing something wrong :)

[04:36:45] <Myx0x3> Gozzy82: http://pastebin.com/DcqE70xt tell me why i dont like fridays xD
[04:37:06] <Myx0x3> just prints out undefiend, and Advanced
[04:37:22] <Myx0x3> fuck
[04:37:26] <Myx0x3> yeah, i know
[04:37:28] <Myx0x3> line 3
[04:38:01] <Gozzy82> :) didnt open the page yet but you figured it out already?
[04:38:36] <Myx0x3> hehe, you always embarrass yourself :P
[04:39:16] <Myx0x3> its like when i go to the store and buy something realy in the morning, and after ive paid im just standing there, and waiting for nothing...
[04:39:22] <Myx0x3> early*
[04:39:39] <Myx0x3> then im like "oh, ive already got the money" and walks away..
[04:39:41] <Myx0x3> fml..
[04:39:43] <Gozzy82> lol
[04:39:58] <lunchub> anyone using "highcharts" ?
[04:39:59] <Myx0x3> im 20 years old, not 80
[04:41:42] <Gozzy82> anyone your using .data all wrong; if you look at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ the syntax for setting a value is $.data($('#someIdorotherReference'), 'key', 'value')
[04:42:09] <Gozzy82> anyone=anyway
[04:42:27] <Myx0x3> hmm, i was looking at the wrong .data then?
[04:42:32] <Myx0x3> http://api.jquery.com/data/ ?
[04:42:37] <Myx0x3> whats the differens?
[04:42:57] <Gozzy82> hmz good point
[04:43:50] <Myx0x3> jQuery.data() VS .data() lol
[04:44:14] <Myx0x3> its the exact same example?
[04:44:22] <Myx0x3> just different code
[04:47:25] <jayflux> the whole layerX and layerY situation which has been deprecated in 1.7. Will i need to make any changes to plugins or my code or is this purely an internal jQuery thing?
[04:47:52] <Gozzy82> Myx0x3 http://www.webdevout.net/test?0k
[04:48:45] <Myx0x3> Gozzy82: first i get undefiend and then myWickedValue"
[04:49:39] <Gozzy82> yeah the first one is not working the second one does..
[04:49:54] <Myx0x3> yeah
[04:51:08] <Gozzy82> sorry havent used jquery in a while just use $(someref).data(key, value); to set it and $(someref).data(key) to get the value
[04:51:49] <Aamir> Gozzy82:  better use jQuery.data(domElement/jQuery.get(), 'key', 'val')
[04:51:56] <Gozzy82> yeah?
[04:52:32] <Gozzy82> Aamir do you know what wrong in the first alert of http://www.webdevout.net/test?0k
[04:52:33] <Aamir> not sure but I remember jqEle.data was not recommended
[04:52:55] <padolsey> If you already have a jQuery object, just use jQueryObject.data(key, val). The jQuery.data method is just for direct setting/retrieval if you have a reference to the DOM node itself.
[04:53:12] <Myx0x3> Gozzy82: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0C
[04:53:24] <Myx0x3> dont work, just like my code :S
[04:53:26] <Aamir> Gozzy82:  read my last msg. you are using jQuery object. Use domElement or jQueryElement.get()
[04:53:33] <Aamir> or jQueryElement[0]
[04:53:41] <Aamir> as first argument of .data
[04:53:41] <Gozzy82> ahh ok so it needs a html el
[04:53:59] <Gozzy82> or how do you call it the real object...
[04:54:10] <Gozzy82> ok i get it thx
[04:54:17] <Aamir> Gozzy82:   $.data($("#myDiv")[0] , ..
[04:54:21] <padolsey> Why are you using $.data instead of $(...).data ?
[04:55:01] <Myx0x3> why does this not work? http://www.webdevout.net/test?0C its not wrong or?
[04:55:12] <Gozzy82> Myx0x3 http://www.webdevout.net/test?0C works for me
[04:55:22] <Myx0x3> wtf!
[04:55:24] <Myx0x3> wierd..
[04:55:34] <padolsey> Myx0x3: Works for me too
[04:56:24] <Aamir> Myx0x3:   use  jQueryObject.data('key', 'val')       Or   $.data( jQueryObject[0], 'key', 'val' )
[04:56:39] <Aamir> note [0]
[04:56:47] <Myx0x3> this is my code on my site: http://pastebin.com/8CrJ1sRY and yes a have an id with submitbutton
[04:57:24] <Aamir> Myx0x3:  wrap everything inside $(function(){})
[04:57:53] <Myx0x3> Aamir: like "$("#submitbutton").data(jQueryObject[0], 'key', 'val' );"?
[04:58:09] <Aamir> Myx0x3:  no :(
[04:58:30] <Myx0x3> then where do i store the value? :S
[04:58:34] <Aamir> Myx0x3:  i think ur problem is that u store the data on $.ready but alerting it outside
[04:58:46] <Myx0x3> Aamir: yeah, prob
[04:59:07] <karim> do browsers beside cache ajax requests ?
[04:59:13] <Aamir> Myx0x3:  http://pastebin.com/gvGb8FaG
[04:59:37] <Myx0x3> but i would like to change the data later im my code? :/
[04:59:38] <Aamir> karim:  you can cache the results
[05:00:36] <Xotix> hi how can i achieve something like that draggable() start: function(event) {$(event.target).wrap('<tr><td></td></tr>');}, ? this doesn't work.
[05:00:40] <Myx0x3> i would realy like to store the data in an HTML5 data-key="value"
[05:01:01] <burzum> i have a list of containers like <div class="block"></div> and within a link, when i click the link i just want to remove the parent div.block, but parent() is removing ALL divs with the class .block. how do i do that right?

[05:13:15] <EdwardIII> $('li').isNthElementInThisPaticularUl() rather
[05:13:43] <EdwardIII> e.g. if it's the 6th element in the ul, jQuery tells me that

[05:29:19] <p4r4n0id> Hey guys! I've a question regarding some DOM-Manipulation
[05:29:42] <p4r4n0id> is somebody there to help me?
[05:30:50] <erichynds> ?ask @ p4r4n0id
[05:30:50] <bot-t> p4r4n0id, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:34:22] <p4r4n0id> I've got a jplayer an want to use the setMedia methode to start a new song. Now everything is right, but if i open a link on my page, with .load into another div I am not able to reach the div with the player out of this .load-ed div
[05:41:28] <seutje> p4r4n0id: what do u mean u can't reach the player?
[05:43:17] <p4r4n0id> that i can set an <a> tag with an onclick-event on the top of the page and can access the javascript object by pushing this: onClick="$('#jquery_jplayer_1').jPlayer('setMedia', ............
[05:43:54] <p4r4n0id> but if i load an php document to another div, and try to use this link out of the .load content it doesn't "know" this object
[05:44:38] <seutje> that makes no sense, the element still exists when the handler is being called and it has access to the entire document
[05:45:09] <seutje> I must be misunderstanding the problem
[05:45:26] <p4r4n0id> yes it's very difficult to describe for me
[05:45:31] <p4r4n0id> german guy ;)
[05:45:52] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ p4r4n0id:
[05:45:52] <bot-t> p4r4n0id:, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:46:01] <seutje> try describing it with a fiddle
[05:46:39] <p4r4n0id> fiddle?
[05:47:24] <seutje> ?paste

[06:00:39] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[06:00:40] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[06:01:58] <gnarf> p4r4n0id: i would suggest using a data-song-url="http://thecurbcrawlers.com/audio/2009/dec/Dawn.mp3" attribute on your element and binding the events to them in your load callback
[06:02:07] <gnarf> p4r4n0id: onclick is EVIL INCARNIT
[06:02:18] <gnarf> +E
[06:02:36] <gnarf> it kills butterfiles
[06:03:07] <p4r4n0id> ^^
[06:03:51] <p4r4n0id> in this searching.php is a while routine which shows all links out of a database
[06:04:03] <p4r4n0id> so i've to create dynamic links
[06:04:23] <gnarf> p4r4n0id: then why not make the href go to say the "song's html page"
[06:04:38] <gnarf> and the add a data-song-url="....mp3" to it
[06:05:05] <p4r4n0id> have you an example for me? i can't figure out what i have to do :-/
[06:06:24] <gnarf> then use $("#show a[data-song-url]").click(function( event ) { $("#jquery_jplayer1").jPlayer("setMedia", $(this).data("songUrl")); event.preventDefault(); }); in the callback function on your load
[06:07:26] <p4r4n0id> that sounds nice. I'll have a try in the evening and will be back if i'm too dump :>
[06:07:32] <gnarf> <a href="/some/url/for/good/measure" data-song-url="/path/to/the.mp3">Some crazy name</a>
[06:07:33] <p4r4n0id> thank you!
[06:16:13] <kurtis> Hey guys, is it easily possible in jquery to turn a whole set of CSS attributes into a serialized string for posting to an API?
[06:18:48] <gnarf> kurtis: easily? no possible yes... but WHY!@?
[06:20:03] <nicorio> Hi. How can I retrieve the border-color value of my input ? I tried $("#libelle_rubrique").css('borderColor'), but it returns an emty string
[06:20:19] <Ch4rAzZz> hi, I have radio-button with name="activity[priority]" how to write selector for it? $(input[name=activity[priority]]).change(... doesn't work for me
[06:21:05] <HardPhuck> how can i reproduce http://www.unidrain.dk/sv/konsument/ (the small pulsating circles) with css and jquery
[06:21:06] <kurtis> gnarf: Well -- I'm creating an API for a jquery app that lets a user dynamically modify a page's style. I figured I could do it one of a couple ways. The easiest for me would be to just receive a whole serialized CSS string. But I didn't know how hard that would be for the jquery developer, so maybe I'll just have him Post each single attribute as they're changed?
[06:21:07] <HardPhuck> any tups
[06:21:10] <HardPhuck> tips?
[06:21:59] <kurtis> gnarf: On my end, I have to take this customized style, and save it to a CSS file. Not a big deal -- but I want to make sure that I make it easy for the jquery developer
[06:23:13] <gnarf> kurtis: you can always iterate over elem.style
[06:24:24] <kurtis> gnarf: But if he did that on the fly, wouldn't it slow things down? I was thinking maybe he could keep an Object in memory where he's duplicating this CSS data -- but I really don't know how hard that would be for him. And everytime he makes a change (or the user clicks save), he could just Post that object as JSON data ? does that sound crazy from a client-side point of view?
[06:25:00] <gnarf> well you have to provide some sort of way to ACTUALLY change the data right?
[06:25:10] <kurtis> gnarf: yep
[06:25:22] <gnarf> why not just use that to store a new rule or whatever in some cache
[06:25:24] <gnarf> that you ship off
[06:25:25] <danzik17> kurtis: is this for a specific site/app with well known elements and all that or some generic thing
[06:26:00] <kurtis> danzik17: Preferably generic so we can add new elements (selectors) to our themes down the line
[06:26:09] <gnarf> its not an easy thing to model really
[06:26:14] <kurtis> hmm
[06:26:39] <gnarf> i mean
[06:26:43] <danzik17> you can do what i did - make a new stylesheet per user and dynamically include it, then use CSS specificity rules so that a user's preferences take precedence over yours
[06:26:49] <gnarf> my definition of "easy" is like do it in <30 minutes
[06:26:54] <kurtis> I really wish I could just collaborate with him on what would be easiest for him -- but the project leader thinks it's improper to work with a subcontractor and not give them precise requirements :(
[06:27:18] <gnarf> this sounds like a >1 day project to me
[06:28:12] <gnarf> kurtis: you might have to make part of that contract a few hours deciding how to best implement your UX together
[06:28:14] <gnarf> :)
[06:28:30] <kurtis> danzik17: Yeah, that's pretty much the plan. The template will have a default style. But the Jquery application needs to be able to let the users change the template style. I'm building a rest API for this and as long as he can get his data to me, i can handle the rest. I'm just not sure on the best way, for his purposes, to accept data
[06:28:35] <kurtis> gnarf: Totally agreed! haha
[06:29:42] <gnarf> kurtis: have you tried to design the editing interface yet?
[06:29:50] <gnarf> because once you have some idea of how the editor will work
[06:29:58] <kurtis> Maybe I'll just give him a single way to submit data, an array of objects that include selector, property, value. he can send an array with one item or many
[06:30:01] <gnarf> understanding how your data is modeled is easy
[06:30:12] <kurtis> gnarf: Yeah, it's all "wireframed"
[06:30:50] <kurtis> gnarf: But I guess the issue I'm running into is -- is there anyway I can make things easier for him?
[06:32:05] <gnarf> kurtis: probably, but like write up a little spec of how you think the data should go
[06:32:20] <gnarf> and put a note on it like "subject to revision"
[06:32:31] <kurtis> gnarf: good idea :)
[06:33:01] <gnarf> or "Would like to have an opprotunity to talk about a better / more comfortable data format"
[06:35:43] <wbeef1> hi all, I am new to jquery; i come from prototype.js.  I dont' understand how to, given an arbitrary element "E", select its descendants that match a rule "R"...i feel stupid
[06:36:09] <wbeef1> this must be easy, i think
[06:36:31] <danzik17> kurtis: i did something like { user: 12345, rules: { 'div.foo': [ { color: red, font-weight: bold  } ], '#bar': [ ... ] } }
[06:37:45] <kurtis> danzik17: That's exactly what I was thinking about having him do. Was that hard for you to implement though?
[06:38:31] <danzik17> kurtis: not in the least.  you can store it in your DB or whatever multiple ways, but as long as that's your input/output format, then easy
[06:38:53] <danzik17> then i just added a style node to the page with the associated rules at runtime
[06:39:02] <kurtis> danzik17: Yeah, on the backend that's really easy :) I was just owrried about from a jquery point of view
[06:39:04] <danzik17> it's the UI thats a PITA
[06:39:07] <wbeef1> oh, nm, i just found ".find()"
[06:40:14] <kurtis> danzik17: haha yep!
[06:40:38] <kurtis> danzik17: If it were me, I'd just keep track of every change in an object ? but it's not me, and I don't want to make his job horrible
[06:41:52] <danzik17> well that's not jquery thing, that's a javascript thing =P  but that seems to be the easiest way to do it imo
[06:42:49] <kurtis> danzik17: Yeah, thanks for the clarification :) And I agree. We'll see what he's capable of. According to the project manager, this guy is "amazing" so I guess I shouldn't worry too much. I just don't want to end up with a crap front-end that we have to rebuild later
[06:51:37] <mike817_> does jQuery have an issue with json returned as application/json?
[06:57:06] <gnarf> ?g json mime type
[06:57:07] <bot-t> gnarf, The *right* JSON content type? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/the-right-json-content-type
[06:57:20] <gnarf> it better not
[06:57:31] <gnarf> mike817_: it does have issues with invalid JSON tho
[06:57:35] <gnarf> have you tried jsonlint ?
[06:57:38] <dschuett> i know this should be simple, but being a noob i can't seem to figure out how to only show the hidden div if the td with the arrow image in it is clicked: http://site.sgtechsolutions.com:8080/elevator/
[06:58:40] <mike817_> weird. as application/json it needs parentheses, but as text/html it doesn't
[07:00:24] <Xotix> How do i wrap my drag target? start: function(event) {$(event.target).wrap()}, doesn't seem to work.
[07:13:19] <dschuett> i know this should be simple, but being a noob i can't seem to figure out how to show the hidden div ONLY if the td with the arrow image in it is clicked (instead of anywhere on the row). The script is at the very top of the source on this page: http://site.sgtechsolutions.com:8080/elevator/
[07:22:49] <kborchers> dschuett: you probably need something like $("#result tr.odd td:has(.arrow)").click(
[07:25:21] <Xotix> dschuett http://pastebin.com/1sfMUdJF something like that?
[07:26:56] <Xotix> I want to wrap my dragged item (which is a whole little table) with <tr><td> when it gets dragged. How can i achieve that? is doinga wrap() on event.target correct?
[07:27:39] <hokapoka> Having some trouble with IE8 and .scroll( callBack ) and var n = .scrollTop();
[07:28:44] <JAAulde> jQuery and UI are just so cloud.  that is all.
[07:29:25] <davemo> how very meta
[07:29:29] <davemo> :P
[07:32:21] <dschuett> Xotix: thats what i was just messing with: the click works ( i can see it switch the arrow) but it doesn't display the row underneath it.) its live here http://site.sgtechsolutions.com:8080/elevator/
[07:32:24] <hokapoka> I'm attaching to the $(document).scroll( callback ) event to capture a scroll to a specific point.
[07:32:43] <dschuett> Xotix: i think it obviously has something to do with using $(this). right?
[07:33:01] <hokapoka> This is find in both IE8 and other browsers, but when I try to read the $(document).scrollTop() in IE I get 0
[07:33:10] <hokapoka> the others I get the respective values.
[07:33:30] <hokapoka> However, $("html").scrollTop() returns the right value in IE.
[07:33:46] <biodegabriel> Hi! Can anyone recommend a pagination plugin? I need something special that will paginate the way a book is paginated (i.e. a fix-height view, like on the iPad) There are lots out options there, but I prefer word-of-mouth to google results. http://bit.ly/njb4Rs :D
[07:33:50] <Xotix> isn't there just a plugin for something like that?
[07:34:09] <Xotix> dschuett:
[07:34:21] <hokapoka> I wondered if there was a "modenizr way" I could use to distinguish the issue rather than hacking some if(ie) crap.
[07:34:44] <mayhem93> hey, this should be short: can some1 help me here? if you could look in the script file @ showDiv() function and tell me what's wrong with the selector
[07:34:48] <mayhem93> here: http://195.182.221.206/portfolio/
[07:34:50] <hokapoka> I guess I could use if( $(body).hassClass("ie8)
[07:35:16] <dschuett> Xotix: i'm not sure. I have it so close, i don't think a plug in is completely necessary.
[07:35:56] <hokapoka> opps  - I guess I could use if( $(body).hasClass("old-ie") ){ ...
[07:36:00] <hokapoka> I'll do that for now.
[07:36:04] <_druu> hello there :)
[07:36:11] <Xotix> i don't have the time atm to help you and also im quite new. But start with just simple css, display the div on click. he nadd animation etc.
[07:36:39] <_druu> I'm looking for a image browser/upload thingy to use with a markdown editor
[07:36:58] <_druu> any suggetions?
[07:37:30] <mayhem93> it's just a short function come one :)
[07:38:54] <kborchers> dschuett: change this $("tr:odd").next("tr") to $(this).parent().next("tr")
[07:41:43] <dschuett> kborchers: That did it! Thanks a million!
[07:41:48] <kborchers> np
[07:42:43] <mayhem93> if i have 2 consecutive elements, how do i select element #2 relative to #1 ?
[07:48:42] <kborchers> ?next @ mayhem93
[07:48:42] <bot-t> mayhem93, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[07:48:45] <xec> mayhem93: consecutive as in next sibling? .next() or use a + in the selector
[07:49:54] <is_null> hi all, key presses in an input are intercepted with this code: el.keyup(function(e) { autocomplete.refresh(); }); but the problem is that it seems to prevent tab to work (tab should move the focus to the next field). Any idea ?
[08:01:05] <sybariten> Well whaddayaknow
[08:01:27] <sybariten> a channel
[08:03:32] <jondot> can i bind on multiple events? such as .bind("ev1", "ev2", function()...) ?
[08:06:35] <ccmonster> how do I trigger the jquery ui autocomplete search event.
[08:06:51] <ccmonster> because i am programmatically putting data in a search box, but it doesn't fire the event. I have to physically go into the input and then type to actually get the event to fire.
[08:08:14] <biodegabriel> Hey all, I want to use jQuery to figure out if a letter has gone beyond the edge of it's containing div. Any advice? I basically want to find which part of a paragraph has overflowed it's div.
[08:15:17] <Pessimism> Based solely on this line, can anyone figure out why this single snippet breaks my jQuery/JS: `$(".thanks").click(function() {
[08:15:17] <Pessimism>  $(".thankers").toggle();
[08:15:17] <Pessimism>  )};`
[08:15:29] <Pessimism> $(".thanks").click(function() {
[08:15:29] <Pessimism>         $(".thankers").toggle();
[08:15:29] <Pessimism>     )};
[08:16:01] <Pessimism> It's like there is something unescaped that breaks it
[08:16:24] <is_null> Pessimism: })
[08:16:34] <Pessimism> great
[08:16:37] <Pessimism> thanks for spotting it
[08:30:03] <ccmonster> anyone have any experience manipulating the autocomplete plugin from jquery ui ?
[08:32:16] <kborchers> ccmonster: manipulate how?
[08:33:06] <ccmonster> well, two things.
[08:34:01] <ccmonster> handling the blur event and the getting the results to go where I want
[08:37:06] <pashmi56> hey i am new to jquery. trying to create my own plugin, 2 questions: one how can I define a function to have callback function arg. 2. how can I check a function is compeleted (to run) ??
[08:37:31] <kborchers> ccmonster: hmmm, could you just use the change event? that is triggered on blur and it gives you the selected item
[08:38:09] <ccmonster> un fortunately...
[08:38:14] <ccmonster> it doesn;t work so well
[08:39:02] <Fox`> anyone found a solution to jquery click events not working on absolutely positioned elements in ie?
[08:39:45] <kborchers> ?doesn't work @ Fox`
[08:39:45] <bot-t> Fox`, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[08:39:58] <pashmi56> http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/01U5
[08:40:23] <ccmonster> kborchers: i got a sample. one sec and I will tweak this fiddle
[08:40:29] <gnarf> pashmi56: functions are just passed like any other argument, give it a name
[08:40:52] <gnarf> pashmi56: "function is completed" what do you mean by that?
[08:41:47] <pashmi56> gnarf: i want to check if the function is comleted for example rotation is completed run the next function
[08:42:01] <gnarf> pashmi56: pass it in to the callback
[08:42:10] <pashmi56> gnarf: did you see my function: http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/01U5
[08:42:25] <gnarf> animate has a callback
[08:42:32] <Fox`> kborchers: a click even even works or it doesn't work. no more explaining is needed
[08:42:35] <Fox`> event*
[08:42:35] <gnarf> pass callbackFunction into the animate, last parameter
[08:42:39] <Fox`> either*
[08:43:00] <rethus> whats better getJSON, or .ajax to request data from PHP-file?
[08:43:13] <gnarf> Fox`: so "doesn't work" means "my handler never executes"
[08:43:17] <gnarf> ?
[08:43:27] <gnarf> ?p
[08:43:27] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:43:35] <pashmi56> gnarf: haa no i dont want to, because i am calling that function somewhere else. and i dont want to have callback there
[08:43:45] <kborchers> Fox`: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/UCLzr/
[08:43:47] <Fox`> found the solution
[08:43:47] <gnarf> and Fox` click events work
[08:43:50] <Fox`> nope
[08:44:02] <gnarf> pashmi56: if the callback was undefined when you passed it in
[08:44:09] <gnarf> its undefined when you pass it to animate
[08:44:13] <gnarf> no loss
[08:44:20] <gnarf> if you pass a callback, you pass a callback
[08:44:22] <gnarf> if not, not
[08:45:04] <ccmonster> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/S9tHT/2/
[08:45:12] <pashmi56> gnarf: im not sure if if i am explaning the issue properly!
[08:45:32] <ccmonster> if you click 'start vetting'
[08:45:47] <gnarf> pashmi56: i think you're explainin it just fine, you just aren't understanding what i'm responding with :)
[08:46:03] <gnarf> if you actually like tried my suggestion, it prolly does what you want...
[08:46:05] <ccmonster> if you click on of the words on the 'question' line it goes into the search box below. That should trigger the search event
[08:46:13] <ccmonster> but it does not.
[08:46:22] <pashmi56> gnarf: hmm ok
[08:46:27] <pashmi56> i will give a go
[08:46:30] <pashmi56> thanks :)
[08:46:38] <gnarf> pashmi56: pass callbackFunction as the third param to .animate()
[08:46:44] <ccmonster> secondly...., if you click somewhere else on the page, thus bluring the search box, the search results dissapear.
[08:47:04] <ccmonster> me no want that. I want to keep the results there until they change the search term.
[08:47:11] <RobW> anyone know where to get a list of makes and models for a dropdown list? then... have the models populate based on makes?
[08:47:22] <pashmi56> gnarf got it thanks
[08:48:13] <tomtomdie> Is there a way to initialize and deinitialize jquery plugins based upon the viewport size?  Basically I want to load a particular jquery plugin on smaller viewports, and then on larger ones deinitialize it and initialize a different one?
[08:48:35] <pashmi56> but in general, i just want to learn for future, how can i define a function to have a callback function like animate? do you have any refrences?
[08:49:31] <xcv> I'm getting a ghost column in the last row after replacing its html with jquery here in chrome, but not in firefox (http://jsfiddle.net/s6hzS/), anyone have an idea why this is happening?
[08:50:41] <ccmonster> maybe you could help me gnarf ?
[08:51:40] <cybersholt_> hello does anyone know why safari 5 throws an error on html5 forms? example http://miketaylr.com/pres/html5/forms2.html
[08:53:03] <Aamir> xcv: you have 5 td's in last row but 6 in others. make a valid table first i guess
[08:53:45] <xcv> Aamir: I'm counting 6 in all rows.
[08:54:13] <eddiemonge> cybersholt_: throws an error where?
[08:54:30] <Patabugen> Is this an acceptable place to ask for help with jQuery File Tree plugin?

[08:54:32] <Aamir> xcv:  http://gyazo.com/3d0cbaf9425828345b752e2e3e51f5ec
[08:54:52] <Patabugen> It doesn't seem to be sending to the server the item which has been clicked on, but I can't figure out why
[08:54:53] <Aamir> Patabugen:  best to ask the creator of the plugin
[08:54:56] <NodeX> is it possible to walk all the way back up the DOM to the parent Iframe ?
[08:55:08] <Aamir> or make a demo on fiddle and paste the link here
[08:55:45] <Patabugen> I'll give it a go Amair
[08:55:47] <Patabugen> thanks
[08:56:03] <eddiemonge> miketaylr would you have an answer to cybersholt_
[08:56:20] <miketaylr> sup
[08:56:32] * miketaylr opens safari
[08:56:50] <cybersholt_> weird isnt it
[08:57:42] <eddiemonge> how do i open safaris console?
[08:57:43] <miketaylr> bizarre
[08:57:50] <miketaylr> eddiemonge: same as chrome
[08:57:53] <miketaylr> cmd+shift+i
[08:58:13] <xcv> Aamir: Ah, that's right. Adding a td didn't solve the problem though... Any ideas?
[08:58:21] <miketaylr> cybersholt_: i don't get those errors... that page isn't doing any assertions :P
[08:58:46] <miketaylr> errr cmd+opt+i, eddiemonge
[08:58:57] <cybersholt_> one sec
[08:58:58] <miketaylr> cybersholt_: but no errors at http://miketaylr.com/code/input-type-attr.html
[08:59:30] <eddiemonge> miketaylr: my safari is broken then. dont i have to enable it first or something?
[08:59:41] <cybersholt_> miketaylr did you try and type random text into the first element ?
[08:59:42] <miketaylr> oh possibly
[08:59:57] <miketaylr> cybersholt_: nope
[09:00:17] <xcv> Aamir: No, it does work. Thanks for pointing this out! Sometimes the error is so stupid one would never expect it :)
[09:00:23] <cybersholt_> thats when i get the asserrtion error
[09:00:41] <Aamir> xcv: http://jsfiddle.net/s6hzS/2/
[09:00:41] <miketaylr> cybersholt_: maybe you can ping hober in #html5 -- he works for apple
[09:00:57] <cybersholt_> cool thanks guys
[09:01:03] <rethus> how can i access an input-field by name?
[09:01:17] <rethus> $("input [name=asdf]").val() ?
[09:01:25] <Aamir> xcv: no problem. Try to simply your stuff for error tracking.
[09:01:51] <Aamir> rethus: thats true
[09:02:12] <lectrick> I'd like to design a set of images that only show the "blue" information in the image until it's rolled over. I don't imagine I can do this with pure CSS, canvas maybe... Ideas?
[09:02:22] <eddiemonge> rethus: $('input[name="some"]')
[09:02:51] <xcv> Aamir: Will do.
[09:03:04] <Aamir> rethus:  http://jsfiddle.net/s6hzS/3/
[09:03:28] <Godfather_> hi
[09:03:53] <Aamir> lectrick:  blue information? blue colour on pic?
[09:04:17] <rethus> ah, the whitespace between input and [name was may failure
[09:04:44] <lectrick> Aamir: Like, the blue channel of the image
[09:04:49] <Godfather_> i'm trying to select an element of select,  $("#my_select").val("The_value").attr("selected", "selected");
[09:04:55] <Godfather_> but i have no success
[09:05:03] <Aamir> lectrick: no idea :(
[09:05:49] <lectrick> Aamir: Found this http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/html5-grayscale-image-hover
[09:05:51] <erichynds> Godfather_: .val() will automatically select it
[09:06:12] <erichynds> Godfather_: if that doesn't work, either your selector isn't matching any elems, or there is no option tag that matches that value
[09:06:51] <Aamir> lectrick: :)
[09:06:59] <kborchers> ccmonster: you need to fire search when you click an option http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/S9tHT/9/
[09:07:10] <Godfather_> erichynds, $("my_select").val("the_value_of_the_option"); ?
[09:07:16] <erichynds> yap
[09:07:21] <erichynds> cept
[09:07:26] <Godfather_> erichynds, let me try it, one moment
[09:07:30] <erichynds> that selector won't match anything, you probably forgot the #
[09:07:51] <Godfather_> ups, i forgot here, i moment, i try
[09:08:14] <rethus> why this little loop didn't work? you see the failure?http://jsfiddle.net/qgF6x/1/

[09:11:29] <ccmonster> kborchers: what did you edit
[09:11:31] <ccmonster> sorry, catching up
[09:11:32] <Godfather_> Aamir, doesnt work for me
[09:11:42] <Godfather_> Aamir, maybe cause im using jqueryui ?
[09:12:13] <ccmonster> ahh, this?             build.search.autocomplete("search");
[09:12:16] <Aamir> Godfather_:  no idea but you cannot blame jqueryUI for this
[09:12:29] <kborchers> ccmonster: right
[09:12:39] <Godfather_> $("#destino").val("Bendinat").attr("selected","selected"); and i have: <select name="destino" id="destino"> <option id="Bendinat" value="Bendinat">
[09:12:54] <drjones69> rethus: Where is 'data' defined in the inner loop?
[09:13:06] <andrew9183> hey guys, in jquery, how do i select a child with a classname foobar, ie i want to do $(this ".foobar") but that doesn't work.
[09:13:09] <ccmonster> bah. i kept trying to add the [value]
[09:13:10] <Aamir> ?demo @Godfather_
[09:13:10] <bot-t> Godfather_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:13:13] <ccmonster> according to the docs
[09:13:14] <ccmonster> bah
[09:13:17] * ccmonster shakes head
[09:13:31] <andrew9183> what's the proper way ?
[09:13:44] <rethus> drjones69: thanks, that was the error
[09:13:52] <andrew9183> i can't do $(this).$(".foobar"), right ?
[09:14:06] <ccmonster> thanks on that kborchers . Next thing is handling the effing blur
[09:14:09] <Aamir> andrew9183:  almost there :)
[09:14:11] <drjones69> rethus: 2nd pair of eyes is always a good thing, glad to help
[09:14:18] <biodegabriel> Is it impossible to select the text that overflowed a div? I can't find anything on google about this.
[09:14:23] <Aamir>  $(this).find(".foobar")
[09:14:31] <andrew9183> ah  okay, thanks
[09:14:35] <ccmonster> when you click anywhere outside of search after the autocomplete opens, it blurs and closes the autocomplete
[09:14:58] <Aamir> andrew9183:  my advice is learn about css selectors a bit
[09:14:58] <rethus> drjones69: yes, right... be glad to get this help... you know.. sometimes you're infront off and didn't see the little pice of code, which makes it failure
[09:15:58] <kborchers> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/S9tHT/10/
[09:16:06] <drjones69> rethus: You can say that again!!  Number of times I've read (and re-read ad infinitum) over the same error and not seen it ;-)
[09:16:06] <SkyFlyer> anyone know of a script where I have 20 languages listed on the page and I want each language to be written in that language style? like greek or something? where should I start?
[09:16:41] <rethus> drjones69: thats the magic of coding :D
[09:16:48] <kborchers> ccmonster: after you create the autocomplete, i just unbind("blur")
[09:16:55] <ccmonster> WTF
[09:16:57] <ccmonster> thats it?
[09:17:03] <kborchers> yep
[09:17:12] <Gorkyman> anyone knows simple jquery calendar day picker?
[09:17:17] <Gorkyman> need as nice and simple as it can get
[09:17:18] <Gorkyman> : )
[09:17:18] <ccmonster> i was on stackoverflow and they all had this blur handling with a variable for 'open' and whatnot
[09:17:23] <ccmonster> aint that a ...
[09:17:44] <kborchers> ccmonster: only thing is it not closing may not be expected behavior but that's up to you
[09:17:53] <drjones69> Gorkyman - Any reason not to use the JqueryUI datepicker one?
[09:18:00] <Gorkyman> there is none
[09:18:03] <Gorkyman> let me try it
[09:18:03] <Gorkyman> : )
[09:18:41] <ccmonster> well. i dont think there is anything unexpected happening
[09:18:46] <ccmonster> im beating it up at the moment
[09:18:47] <drjones69> it's in the current version of UI, are you perhaps running an old version?
[09:18:51] <Godfather_> Aamir: http://jsfiddle.net/BM43K/
[09:19:17] <kborchers> i mean, i would expect it to close when i click out ccmonster
[09:19:19] <Gorkyman> do I need jquery library to use UI ?
[09:19:31] <kborchers> now you have to delete the contents to get rid of autocomplete
[09:19:37] <kborchers> Gorkyman: yes
[09:20:16] <ccmonster> Well.yea, i can just kill the contents on each search, then have it re-populate
[09:20:51] <kborchers> ccmonster: yeah ... like i said, if you can make it a good user experience, that solution of unbind should work fine for you
[09:21:00] <ccmonster> yea.
[09:21:26] <ccmonster> i think the issue is making whatever the 'blur' event triggers to trigger only when the search term changes
[09:21:42] <ccmonster> essentially im turning the autocomplete into more of a standard 'searcher'
[09:22:50] <kborchers> ccmonster: you can see here blur just closes the autocomplete and calls the internal _change method https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/blob/menu_tables/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L181
[09:23:49] <ccmonster> which line
[09:24:00] <ccmonster> ahh 181, drr
[09:24:06] <Godfather_> Aamir any ideas?
[09:24:23] <kborchers> yeah ... i just noticed that's on my repo in a branch but that file is the same as 1-8-stable
[09:24:28] <ccmonster> so what are you suggesting kborchers ? How would I trigger the internal method then
[09:24:46] <kborchers> you mean _change?
[09:25:15] <ccmonster> yea
[09:25:18] <ccmonster> from my script
[09:25:29] <ccmonster> autocomplete('_change') wont work
[09:25:35] <necromancer> Gorkyman: yeah
[09:25:47] <necromancer> pfft sorry i didn't see kborchers reply
[09:26:03] <kborchers> ccmonster: so you need to get the change event is that it?
[09:26:39] <ccmonster> That's what I am taking away from this. Essentially I want to get to the _change event when someones changes the search
[09:27:02] <ccmonster> the let the normal events fire after that. This way I correctly remove the search contents
[09:29:33] <ccmonster> would that be right kborchers ?
[09:29:53] <Gorkyman> can I color some days in UI datepicker differently?
[09:30:14] <kborchers> ccmonster: not sure what you're trying to do
[09:30:20] <kborchers> what do you mean "remove the search contents"
[09:30:36] <ccmonster> um. When the search terms change, then remove the last search results that were shown.
[09:30:52] <ccmonster> however, dont remove them on blur or w/e
[09:31:03] <ccmonster> which is more standard search.
[09:32:13] <kborchers> that should already happen since the results are updated on keypress and now a search is performed when you add a word with your links so not sure what it's not doing that you need it to
[09:32:27] <Aamir> Godfather_: working http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/BM43K/1/
[09:32:53] <Aamir> u didn't include jQuery lib
[09:33:03] <Aamir> and yes u need jQuery for jQueryUI
[09:33:04] <Godfather_> Aamir: i see, works, but misteriosly on my page
[09:33:11] <Godfather_> doesnt work
[09:34:46] <ccmonster> it wont do it kborchers
[09:34:54] <ccmonster> check your own fiddle
[09:35:36] <kborchers> won't do what? it does everything i described for me here
[09:36:07] <ccmonster> ok. try this. click in search. delete 'banana' , now type 'peach'
[09:37:09] <kborchers> and nothing comes up ... which is expected since you don't have peach in any of your results
[09:37:13] <ccmonster> I assume the change/keyup should still fire the search event, but maybe not
[09:37:29] <ccmonster> ah shit. this doesnt have all the sample stuff lol
[09:37:30] <ccmonster> drrrrrrr
[09:37:40] <kborchers> :)
[09:37:54] <ccmonster> ok. last question kborchers ....
[09:38:05] <kborchers> ok, last answer ;)
[09:38:11] <ccmonster> changing or adding classes to the search results.
[09:38:20] <ccmonster> do I have to do this each time the open event is fired?
[09:38:27] <kborchers> no
[09:38:30] <ccmonster> by normal element traversal.
[09:38:33] <kborchers> look at this
[09:38:35] <kborchers> one sec
[09:38:36] <ccmonster> ok
[09:39:05] <kborchers> ccmonster: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[09:39:10] <kborchers> look at the demo source
[09:39:12] <gustonegro> has anyone any experience with jQuery on windows vista IE 7?
[09:39:24] <kborchers> ccmonster: .data( "autocomplete" )._renderItem
[09:39:31] <kborchers> you can use that to render the items any way you want
[09:39:43] <ccmonster> i think i saw that, but at the time didnt track it down
[09:39:45] <gustonegro> I have some things that run VERY slowly in IE7, but okay in a webkit environment
[09:40:23] <ccmonster> sucks there isn't a method that allows you to override insides the autocomplete function.
[09:40:28] <ccmonster> would be nice and neat, but this is fine
[09:42:03] <necromancer> gustonegro: not windows vista IE 7, but IE 7 in general yes.
[09:42:13] <necromancer> you're probably going to have issues like that
[09:43:54] <ccmonster> kborchers: so just appending that at the end of the .autocomplete({}).data.......
[09:45:05] <devc> Anyone seen Whirl3d today?
[09:45:24] <kborchers> ccmonster: no
[09:45:45] <ccmonster> .....
[09:45:51] <kborchers> after you do your build.search.autocomplete({...})
[09:46:06] <kborchers> or before ... either way
[09:46:08] <kborchers> you would do
[09:46:31] <kborchers> no sorry, has to be after i think
[09:46:39] <kborchers> build.search.data("autocomplete")._renderItem...
[09:46:46] <ccmonster> hmmm.
[09:46:51] <ccmonster> let me throw up a sample one sec.
[09:47:48] <kborchers> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/S9tHT/11/
[09:48:47] <erichynds> ccmonster: make sure to clean it off first
[09:48:53] <ccmonster> ok. that makes more sense.
[09:49:26] <ccmonster> but its proabbly better to not hardcode the attributes, granted this is just a rough example
[09:49:29] <kborchers> ccmonster: yeah ... it requires a little more knowledge of autocomplete internals but that should get you going
[09:49:42] <kborchers> right, classes would be better
[09:50:04] <ccmonster> what sense do you mean classes?
[09:50:26] <kborchers> oh, i see what you were saying
[09:50:37] <ccmonster> I meant more like, $( "<li></li>" ).css('background-color','#d20001')...
[09:50:47] <kborchers> oh
[09:50:51] <ccmonster> or css ({})
[09:51:16] <kborchers> that doesn't really matter ... either way you're "hard-coding" it
[09:51:25] <ccmonster> what did you mean by classes then..?
[09:52:04] <kborchers> i wouldn't say css(a bunch of properties) i would just do addClass or put the class in the li when it's building then have the styles in your stylesheet
[09:52:21] <hjf> does anyone know about a jquery-based tumbnail viewer for varying image sizes? I've seen a few but they're for square images. I'd like to crop the thumbnail and see the full thumb when I hover
[09:52:22] <Bearcat> hey folks. I just started working with jquery the other day and i'm trying to get some buttons pulsating. it *almost* works, except that when the mouse leaves the button the color does not reset and the text color does not ever change. I thnk it's a mistake in my $(this).css line. Would someone mind giving me a hand? http://autoalert.feline-soul.net  thanks so much. i'm spazzing a bit over this.
[09:52:41] <kborchers> also, there are probably UI styles that you can/should override to make it look how you want
[09:52:41] <ccmonster> ah, well yea, in the class example, sure.
[09:52:59] <Bearcat> for what it's worth the pulsate code is from here http://www.tonylea.com/2011/jquery-illuminate/
[09:52:59] <ccmonster> the .css() hardcodes in the same way
[09:53:05] <necromancer> ccmonster: i'd use .css() if you're passing in CSS modifications via an options object, like in a plugin or something. other than that, there's no reason not to define a class in your CSS file and simply addClass it to the element
[09:53:30] <ccmonster> but yea, addClass, and doing $("<li></li>",{......})
[09:53:33] <necromancer> .css() is extra, unnecessary overhead. css files get loaded quickly and (the way i code) before JS, so everything's already there and set up
[09:54:26] <kborchers> ccmonster: ok, hope that gets you on your way ... time for me to do my job now ;)
[09:54:41] <ccmonster> i hear ya.
[09:54:44] <ccmonster> thank you very much kborchers
[09:54:47] <kborchers> np
[09:55:05] <Gorkyman> hmm.. should this work: if (new Date (2011, 0, 3) == new Date (2011, 0, 3)) ?
[09:56:30] <necromancer> hjf: not jQuery but http://www.magictoolbox.com/magiczoom/
[09:56:44] <necromancer> is pretty nice
[09:56:48] <necromancer> you do have to pay for it though
[09:56:53] <necromancer> but it works with any JS framework
[10:02:27] <Bearcat> if i draw my mouse across the buttons they all change and dont' change back. I think i need a .stop somewhere but i'm not sure where it goes.
[10:03:06] <devc> Bearcat: Can I see a url?
[10:03:34] <Bearcat> devc: i posted it in the original whining, but here you go :") autoalert.feline-soul.net Thank you!
[10:03:48] <Bearcat> devc: i'm so close!
[10:07:19] <Bearcat> devc: what i'm attempting to do is to change the text to white when the mouse is hovering and the button is pulsating, then to change the button back to tan and the text to it's orginal color when it moves out of the button.
[10:08:45] <drjones69> bearcat: I believe css() expects a set, ie .css({'color':'white'})
[10:09:24] <Bearcat> drjones69: i'll alter that and see wht it does.
[10:10:54] <drjones69> Bearcat: please don't think I'm ignoring you if I don't respond to any followups - packing away, but this irc session runs from a machine that stays on.
[10:11:40] <Bearcat> drjones69: thank you. I appreciate any help i can get.
[10:13:58] <devc> Bear I think it's good as is. As far as I know you can set one element like that. I dunno the illuminate plugin but are you just changing the background image and the text?
[10:14:43] <Bearcat> devc: i'm not sure what the illuminate fuction actually does. It's not my work, it's a plugin
[10:15:27] <devc> What about doing a function() { $(this).animate({ color: '#fff', backgroundImage: 'url(images/newBg.png)' }); }, function() { $(this).animate({ color: '#cdc4b3', backgroundImage: 'url(images/oldBg.png)' }); }
[10:16:01] <devc> oops. I forgot to add the .stop()'s before the .animate()'s
[10:16:18] <devc> function() { $(this).stop().animate({ color: 'irc://irc.freenode.net/#fff', backgroundImage: 'url(images/newBg.png)' }); }, function() { $(this).stop().animate({ color: '#cdc4b3', backgroundImage: 'url(images/oldBg.png)' }); }
[10:17:46] <chovy> what kind of color is that?
[10:18:02] <Bearcat> devc: well, the trick is that the background-image is just a tranparent gradient, so i can change the background color of the button at will
[10:18:07] <chovy> color: 'irc://irc.freenode.net/#fff'
[10:18:16] <Bearcat> chovy: a frightening one for sure.
[10:18:36] <Bearcat> chovy: we call it Freenode White
[10:18:40] <chovy> lol
[10:19:18] <chovy> I'm going to paint my kitchen Freenode White.
[10:19:51] <Bearcat> chovy: it's similar to HeaddeskBlue
[10:24:18] <Bearcat> devc: you helped me fix one issue! The buttons now don't all get confused by each other's states. I put the .stop() infront of the .illuminate and .illuminateDie fuctions and that did it. Now all i have to do is change the colors a bit and i'm all good.
[10:31:22] <Bearcat> interesting. If i put properties in a hover style it does not take. Does the hover event of the jquery cause the hover event in the css for that element to be ignored?
[10:32:13] <necromancer> shouldn't...
[10:34:45] <Bearcat> necromancer: well it does if your a doofus and don't notice that you left off the # on the selector in your css! *ahem*
[10:36:36] <phlp> anyone in oklahoma looking for a job?
[10:37:06] <kyledr> if i have a core data object that changes elsewhere in the app, will this object be modified? it seems no from my testing. what's the best way to have the object reflect the new changes? just fetch it again by objectId?
[10:40:56] <ccmonster> hey kborchers ...
[10:41:11] <kborchers> yo
[10:41:16] <ccmonster> something very weird.
[10:41:48] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/S9tHT/11/
[10:42:05] <ccmonster> click banana. or just try typing 'pea'
[10:42:29] <ccmonster> you will see that peaches shows up when you have 'p' , or 'pe' but once you hit 'pea' it dissapears
[10:43:16] <kborchers> ccmonster: you have a different link? that still doesn't have all test data
[10:43:23] <ccmonster> um i thought i added it
[10:43:31] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/S9tHT/12/
[10:44:50] <ccmonster> kborchers: or this - http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/S9tHT/13/
[10:47:42] <kborchers> ccmonster: it's the positioning of your autocomplete
[10:47:50] <kborchers> it's there, just hidden by something
[10:47:55] <ccmonster> the position.
[10:47:58] <ccmonster> hmm
[10:48:00] <ccmonster> thats odd

[10:52:50] <patbam> hi, can anyone help me figure out what's going wrong with this test of getJSON? http://jsfiddle.net/snifty/2xYyY/
[10:52:57] <k1t> cmon people im asking a channel of 900 people something trivial to anyone even intermediate
[10:52:57] <ccmonster> hmm phlp . one sec. let me check
[10:53:26] <k1t> owell
[10:53:52] <`WarpKat> klt:  try looking at .select()
[10:53:54] <ajpiano> k1t: var bool = true;  $("#foo").change(function() { bool = $(this).is(":checked");  });
[10:54:04] <`WarpKat> or what ajpiano said
[10:54:23] <k1t> ajaykools: that is sexy.
[10:54:25] <k1t> thank you guys
[10:54:26] <k1t> :)
[10:54:45] <pifantastic> k1t: thanks for asking so kindly
[10:55:11] <pifantastic> and waiting that whole 2 minutes
[10:55:15] <pifantastic> before being a dick
[10:55:24] <patbam> updated version with a bit more explanation: http://jsfiddle.net/snifty/2xYyY/2/
[10:55:35] <k1t> pifantastic: apologies, but it works every time
[10:55:45] <k1t> especially in here
[10:55:51] <k1t> lol
[10:55:58] <k1t> <3
[10:56:08] <pifantastic> ?uaa @ k1t
[10:56:09] <bot-t> k1t, ur an alligator
[10:56:15] <phlp> patbam: your .click() is missing a ) on line 6
[10:56:38] <ccmonster> phlp: why would that matter phlp ?
[10:56:50] <patbam> phlp: sure enough, thanks. http://jsfiddle.net/snifty/2xYyY/3/ still not working tho
[10:56:55] <k1t> :( ill play nice next time
[10:57:14] <k1t> back to work, ty again..
[10:57:48] <phlp> ccmonster: not really sure. i dont know if that is supported, i havnt seen it and putting it all in one content fixed the problem so that was my suggestion
[10:58:10] <ccmonster> ah. interesting. must be something with jquery mobile
[10:58:28] <patbam> firebug is telling me that the json has an "invalid label"
[10:59:59] <takahiro> myDiv = document.createElement("div"); myDiv.style.cssText = 'border:solid 1px black"; is giving me an error in FF saying "Not enough arguments", what does it mean?
[11:00:07] <ccmonster> that worked in fiddle? because that didnt work very well for me
[11:00:10] <CVirus> $(".foo").hide(); .. how can I hide an element that has the classes "foo" and "bar"
[11:00:44] <kyledr> is there a slicker way to get changes to a core data object than just re-assigning it like: self.image = [self.MOC objectWithID:[self.image objectID]]; ?
[11:01:09] <devc> CVirus: $(".member:foo, .bar").hide();
[11:01:16] <patbam> it's weird, because i can see that the data is being returned in the conosle
[11:01:17] <devc> what the heck...
[11:01:27] <devc> CVirus: $(".foo, .bar").hide();
[11:01:36] <devc> or do you mean BOTH
[11:02:22] <CVirus> devc: BOTH :-)
[11:02:37] <CVirus> $(".piece_price.form-row").hide();
[11:02:41] <CVirus> figured it out .. Thanks
[11:03:39] <devc> if you need both you can attack it with css: $(".foo.bar").hide(); or you w...
[11:03:41] <devc> okay.
[11:03:48] <devc> That would work in older versions of IE
[11:03:57] <devc> won't, not would. It WONT work.
[11:06:33] <phlp> patbam: http://jsfiddle.net/2xYyY/4
[11:07:21] <patbam> phlp: oh, thanks. the only difference was the JSON.stringify?
[11:07:47] <phlp> and callback on the url instead of jsoncallback
[11:09:06] <patbam> phlp: oh, thanks.
[11:09:55] <mcqueen_> hi all
[11:10:31] <mcqueen_> i need help about updating google map markers without page refresh
[11:11:05] <mcqueen_> i create a web site which shows earthquakes on google map....
[11:11:14] <mcqueen_> i bought a template for this.
[11:11:30] <mcqueen_> and i upgraded it by php
[11:11:49] <mcqueen_> now google map is running with javascript
[11:12:06] <mcqueen_> but i dont know javascript
[11:12:20] <SkyFlyer> hey. i'm doing an append to a select drop down.  any way to check if that option exists already and not append it if it does ???
[11:12:46] <mcqueen_> can you look at my site source codes and give a way for update markers without page refresh?
[11:12:57] <mcqueen_> is it possible?
[11:14:00] <mcqueen_> my site is http://depremalarmi.com
[11:14:04] <mcqueen_> pls help mi

[11:17:45] <ArghMonday> when there are multiple events on the same element is there a way to determine it's precidence?
[11:19:21] <ravenzz> ArghMonday the order you are binding them to the object
[11:19:27] <CVirus> I have a combobox with 2 choices ... I want to hide/show a certain div when the user selects one of the choices .. help ?
[11:20:07] <ArghMonday> ravenzz...that was my understanding as well.  I have one bound inline and one bound in the footer.  The footer event is firing first.
[11:21:04] <CVirus> I think this is it $("#ComboBox").change(function() { /* do something here */ });
[11:22:27] <ArghMonday> ravenzz... are inlines given lowest presidence first?  I'm trying to understand the reason why bindings in the footer are first (they are src referenced in the footer).
[11:24:01] <devc> mcqueen_: It might be hard to find someone to simply do the work for you.
[11:27:18] <ravenzz> ArghMonday how do you bind them?
[11:28:16] <takahiro> how do i change a TextNode element to a new chunk of html?
[11:28:40] <ArghMonday> ravenzz... tried bind() method and click().  Same result
[11:29:20] <ArghMonday> ravenzz... but I want to understand one thing here, it doesnt matter whether it's inline or sourced correct?
[11:31:09] <ravenzz> ArghMonday you should bind them on document ready
[11:31:41] <ravenzz> can you provide a demo?
[11:31:42] <ArghMonday> ravenzz.... yes on document ready
[12:02:31] <devc> Anyone seen Whirl3d today?

Anyone have an ideas how to work around this so called "security/privacy protection"
[12:05:49] <LSshock> I can only alter the color of the a:visited nothing else works
[12:09:14] <devc> takahiro: Is there a reaosn it's in an iFrame?
[12:09:17] <devc> reason*
[12:11:12] <takahiro> i copied how the lightweight rich text jquery plugin did it http://plugins.jquery.com/project/lwRTE
[12:11:30] <takahiro> they used an iframe, i haven't learned why yet
[12:12:58] <devc> takahiro: So can we take a step back and talk about what the actual application of this is gonna be? Why are vowels being bolded?
[12:13:17] <sfentress> Hi all. I am trying to get the value of a JQuery UI Slider while the user is moving it. I can bind to the "slide" event, but when the event is called, $(this).slider("value") is always one step behind
[12:13:22] <sfentress> the slide event fires before the value changes
[12:13:29] <sfentress> any help on getting the current value?
[12:14:32] <takahiro> devc: i'm just experimenting, my final goal is a custom rich text editor for my wiki
[12:14:44] <saimon69> hi@all
[12:15:12] <saimon69> have a damn recursive bug that affect the site am working on, mostly on ie but happen on firefox too
[12:15:34] <saimon69> looks like the inline jquery script sometimes does not start
[12:15:42] <takahiro> devc: i couldn't find any rich text editors that worked the way i wanted, and really, i'm not trying to build a rich text editor, more like a "syntax highlighted" editor, so certain keywords become bold
[12:15:48] <saimon69> or start but fails to recognize the events
[12:16:06] <saimon69> other jquery scripts in the page seems to work mostly fine
[12:16:26] <saimon69> but this is the core for an application form so is vital to work properly
[12:16:45] <saimon69> for compatibility reasons have to use 1.4.3
[12:17:25] <saimon69> is behaving like this in almost all pages sometimes tihngs load sometimes not
[12:17:41] <sfentress> any thoughts on the UI Slider question? It seems a bit pointless to be able to bind to the slide action if you can't work out where the user slid to.
[12:18:03] <saimon69> and dont'have enough knowledge of javascipt innards to know where to look to fix it

[12:30:40] <JAAulde> I know you can't help me with the particular error with no code and no info, but I don't even know where to start looking
[12:30:45] <ThePendulum> wHERE WOULD i NEED TO LOOK TO FIND OUT HOW TO INSTALL A PLUGIN?
[12:30:56] <ThePendulum> Wow, caps-lock, sorry *blush*
[12:31:15] <JAAulde> ThePendulum: you don't install a plugin...you include the plugin file after including jQuery
[12:31:59] <JAAulde> download the plugin script, put it on your server, point to it in your markup with a script tag after jQuery's script tag
[12:32:16] <ThePendulum> Well, you implement or install it somehow anyway. Getting it take part of jQuery

[12:46:52] <Whirl3d> how do you determine if an element's background image is loaded?
[12:47:23] <Cade> I have a simple dropdown menu set up. The show() function is attached to the mouseenter event on an <li> tag. The submenu is another <ul> inside the same <li>. It disappears when I roll onto it. How do I keep it visible?
[12:47:25] <scar2> phlp: yes, but where do i put that? how do i get a link to call that code?
[12:47:49] <qwertymk> Whirl, why not preload it and then check when the reloaded img is loaded (the background img will load the same time)
[12:47:59] <Cade> Thing is, it was staying visible until I added a duration to the show and hide functions.
[12:48:01] <devc> Whirl3d: haha hi ;) Good question, I was wondering that myself, actually.
[12:48:09] <scar2> phlp: i tried onClick="" but it doesnt work
[12:48:20] <phlp> scar2: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#chapter-5
[12:48:21] <Whirl3d> devc, good to see you. You are gonna love what I have done for you. LOL
[12:48:34] <devc> Whirl3d: In your case, there will be a preloader script running since there's gonna be a LOOOOOT of images.
[12:49:57] <scar2> phlp: why isnt this working then? http://pastebin.com/fRSd1axu
[12:50:26] <phlp> scar2: put the .click inside $(document).ready
[12:50:36] <scar2> hmmm
[12:50:48] <scar2> sorry, for some reason javascript to jquery transition is difficult haha
[12:50:52] <scar2> should hvek nown that tho
[12:53:16] <Dollz> http://jsfiddle.net/kMBYk/ Can any one see this 8 lines of code and tell me what variables are visible in success function ? http://jsfiddle.net/kMBYk/
[12:53:33] <scar2> phlp: u know, is there a way to make the website behind the dialog fade out when it opens? like makes the dialog box always on top and u cant click anything outside of it or it will close?
[12:54:25] <scar2> phlp: besides the modal setting
[12:54:25] <phlp> scar2: the modal:true option for the dialog
[12:54:34] <scogle> does anyone know where I can find an example of something like this: http://cl.ly/3b070V2n3f3g0q2L2V2K
[12:55:05] <phlp> scar2: why not modal?
[12:55:17] <ThePendulum> Why not zoidberg?
[12:55:27] <xckpd7> got a question: I'm using a plugin, and I'm calling it. To use their public functions, I need to call it with a variable, and use that variable. The problem is, I'm calling it from an .each() method, and I want to use the public methods but I don't want to bind a click element multiple times
[12:55:35] <scar2> phlp: i realize my problem is i am not sure how to set multiple options. i tried autoOpen: false; modal: true;
[12:55:43] <scar2> its a syntax error most liekly
[12:55:51] <xckpd7> so how do I get access to that variable inside that loop?
[12:55:56] <phlp> { autoOpen: false, modal: true }
[12:56:14] <Cade> ThePendulum, because he's poor and hideous.
[12:56:24] <ThePendulum> Touch√©
[12:57:00] <ThePendulum> Would some care to explain me how the placeholder plugin for jQuery works, if anyone knows? thanks!
[12:59:52] <takahiro> why does .find('#rootDoc:last-child') result in a security error code 1000?
[13:01:15] <phlp> maybe because it makes no sense. if you want #rootDoc then select it with the id. if you want the last child of #rootDoc then put a space between them
[13:09:11] <takahiro> oh

[13:35:47] <orl> Hi!
[13:36:22] <remx> hi
[13:36:29] <orl> I'm trying to change html5 video src (in <source>) with jQuery, but it seems I've got to use html5 video's load() method, but it doesn't seem to work
[13:36:44] <apollo13> what's the difference between $('a').live('click') and .delegate('a', 'click')
[13:36:59] <orl> See here: http://reseau.ammd.net/Sites/2010_SC_spip/spip
[13:37:22] <orl> then click on the link called 'Pornograf', and click on the video
[13:37:35] <Zzaichik> I know that .live() isn't like by IE..
[13:37:44] <erichynds> wat
[13:37:50] <NaBro> is that link called 'Pornograf' work safe? ;)
[13:37:51] <erichynds> live works fine on IE..
[13:38:22] <NaBro> apollo13: see here - http://www.alfajango.com/blog/the-difference-between-jquerys-bind-live-and-delegate/
[13:38:42] <orl> I'm doing this: $('video#id')[0].load() and after $('video#id')[0].play(), isn't it the way I should do?
[13:38:43] <apollo13> NaBro: thx will rtfm and bug you later :)
[13:38:58] <orl> NaBro: yeah
[13:39:02] <remx> If a html page is loading script1.js followed by script2.js - would there be any complications merging the 2 files? I only have a production server otherwise I would try it myself
[13:39:28] <orl> NaBro: there is no porn in it
[13:39:35] <orl> (except the titles!)
[13:39:44] <orl> and the video doesn't start, anyway!
[13:39:50] <NaBro> remx: just make sure script 2 lives after script 1 in the file and it should be all good
[13:40:37] <apollo13> NaBro: thx that made it clear, delegate it is then^^
[13:41:21] <bakedace> http://jsfiddle.net/pHCMK/1/
[13:42:05] <bakedace> please help
[13:43:35] <bakedace> everything works, except the links to the left of the "active" link... dont hold on to the subnav
[13:45:57] <madsara> ‰
[13:48:52] <orl> NaBro: does it evoke something to you?
[13:48:57] <seanh> If I have an <input type="text"> that is not inside a form, is there an event for when the user presses Return in the input?
[13:49:43] <bakers> seanh: keydown
[13:49:50] <bakers> seanh: or keyUp
[13:50:05] <bakers> seanh: http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[13:50:09] <seanh> I have to check for the Return key? ok
[13:50:12] <NaBro> orl: i only see 2 links and neither say "Pornograf"
[13:50:33] <orl> Arf, got to go over the big cicrle
[13:50:42] <orl> Pornograf is on the right part of it
[13:51:19] <seanh> thanks
[13:56:02] <NaBro> orl: after you change the src value, you're calling .load() again on it?
[13:57:16] <n8o-mba_> is there a way to see what functions are bound to an element?
[13:57:24] <n8o-mba_> such as what will happen on .click()?
[13:57:51] <dlama> What is the best way to scroll to a div with an unique id within a scrollable jquery-ui tab ?
[13:59:03] <NaBro> n8o-mba_: can you use chrome's web inspector and use the event listeners section of the elements panel?
[13:59:39] <orl> NaBro : yes
[13:59:47] <orl> NaBro: why, again ?
[13:59:49] <n8o-mba_> NaBro: it's not showing up anyway
[14:00:14] <orl> When changing the <source> src, one has to use that html5 video load metho
[14:00:19] <orl> s/metho/method
[14:00:25] <NaBro> n8o-mba_: is it possible the event is bound to a parent or child element?
[14:00:43] <n8o-mba_> NaBro: not 100% sure
[14:01:09] <NaBro> n8o-mba_: in the elements panel, try selecting a wrapping parent element or even a child to see where the event is bound
[14:01:46] <n8o-mba_> NaBro: nothing (it's a simple document - qunit fixture)
[14:01:52] <n8o-mba_> I may conclude that nothing is bound
[14:02:00] <dreamss> any one here know jq mobile by any chance?
[14:02:04] <NaBro> orl: i'm not familiar with it, sorry. i would think that if you updated the src you would just need to run .load() on the source element
[14:02:32] <orl> NaBro: that's what I thought too, but it doesn't seem to work
[14:02:42] <orl> Just to be sure, the way I invoke .load() is OK?
[14:02:52] <orl> ('$video#id')[0].load()
[14:03:26] <NaBro> orl: i think you need to use ('$video#id source')[0].load()
[14:03:46] <xckpd7> question... how expensive is the selector $(this).parent.parent.parent.next.find?
[14:04:37] <bakers> xckpd7: Not too bad
[14:04:38] <orl> NaBro: hmmm, yes... I think I've been trying this already, but I'm going to try again
[14:04:42] <bakers> xckpd7: Not good form, but ok
[14:05:09] <bakers> xckpd7: A basic rule of thumb is, if you you functions it's fast
[14:05:25] <xckpd7> bakers: huh?
[14:05:26] <NaBro> orl: is ('$video#id')[0] the source element or the video element? i believe it has to be done on source
[14:05:38] <xckpd7> bakers: if there is a better way to do this I'm entirely open to it
[14:05:40] <bakers> It's only you do something weird like $("div > .class + sibling:eq[3]") that it gets slow
[14:06:04] <bakers> xckpd7: Well if you're traversing that much of the dom tree why not just give the other element an ID
[14:06:09] <NaBro> orl: oops sorry, it should be on video not source
[14:06:15] * NaBro needs more coffee
[14:06:40] <xckpd7> That's the problem... i'm using this in an each method
[14:06:48] <bakers> xckpd7: There is always .closest() also
[14:06:53] <xckpd7> I can't do it outside the each because the plugin won't let me
[14:06:56] <bakers> xckpd7: instead of three .parents()
[14:06:57] <orl> NaBro: so that's what I've been doing first.... Don't understand why it doesn't work
[14:07:02] <NaBro> orl: have you tried to get the value of source before calling .load() again to make sure you're actually updating the source properly?
[14:07:46] <xckpd7> bakers: I tried making the call outside of each but it needs to have the each context for some reason... yeah I suppose closest might work better
[14:08:29] <orl> NaBro: I've been verifying in Firebug that the sources were OK, and that's fine
[14:09:23] <orl> NaBro: if I do this with <video src="">, it works, because <video>'s src is changed, but when changing the <source>'src, it seems I've got to use that load thing
[14:09:49] <orl> But actually, no matter what I'm trying to do, when invoking load, there's nothing loaded in the net tab of Firebug
[14:14:29] <chovy> how do i hide all but the first three <li>'s in a list?
[14:15:07] <chovy> something like $("li:nth-child(3)").hide();
[14:15:38] <phlp> $('li:gt(2)').hide();
[14:16:35] <DRSK> How would one find all 'checkbox' and replace with 'radio' for a given #id ?
[14:21:05] <chovy> phlp: thanks
[14:21:27] <chovy> DRSK: you want the same attributes, etc?
[14:25:22] <bakedace> http://jsfiddle.net/pHCMK/2/ please help :)
[14:26:29] <takahiro> hi, i copied a working src from http://bit.ly/t0B9DF  and added two lines (my test page http://thorie.com/rich/test2.html) and the cursor position doesn't get saved... any hints on how to fix it?
[14:29:03] <chovy> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/ZML9Z/
[14:31:14] <takahiro> i think ranges are destroyed when the html is changed, even if identical html is inserted back
[14:31:16] <NewtonianB> how can i unscape data?
[14:31:26] <NewtonianB> that i escapd with python
[14:31:28] <NewtonianB> with jquery
[14:32:16] <patrick99e99> is there a jquery method that will return true if an element's decendants contains certain text or an alt tag has that text?
[14:32:31] <necromancer> NewtonianB: you already escaped it...you can't...
[14:32:39] <patrick99e99> like if I had <li><a>foo</a></li> and <li><a><img alt="foo"></a></li>
[14:32:46] <SpaG> just check the .size(), patrick99e99
[14:32:57] <patrick99e99> SpaG: size?
[14:33:02] <SpaG> of the result of a particular selector
[14:33:08] <NewtonianB> Im passing html through json file so i escape it
[14:33:11] <necromancer> patrick99e99: you could check $('#element').find('a').text() == ''
[14:33:16] <SpaG> $("selector").size()
[14:33:20] <NewtonianB> then when parsing that json data i need to unescape the html to output it
[14:33:40] <necromancer> NewtonianB: why do you need to escape the HTML?
[14:33:57] <patrick99e99> SpaG: but I need test text content AND alt tag content..
[14:33:59] <necromancer> i assume you're turning it into ASCII &#num; stuff?
[14:34:01] <patrick99e99> is there a method to do that at once?
[14:34:13] <SpaG> patrick99e99, you can write a selector for that
[14:34:28] <patrick99e99> SpaG: can you point me in the right direction?
[14:34:32] <SpaG> wait
[14:34:39] <necromancer> patrick99e99: $('li > a').text() == 'foo' && $('li > a').attr('alt') == 'foo'
[14:35:01] <necromancer> that will select any <a> under any <li> and check if its inner HTML is "foo" and if it's alt="" attribute is foo
[14:35:02] <NewtonianB> necromancer: because it has quotattions and such
[14:35:17] <SpaG> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[14:35:28] <patrick99e99> necromancer: will the li > a match images inside the a ?
[14:35:40] <SpaG> take a look at these
[14:36:58] <necromancer> patrick99e99: no, it will only match any <a> in any <li>.
[14:37:06] <SpaG> so in your case it would be something like $("li child[attr=value]")
[14:37:56] <chovy> $("li").length would be the size - 1? or the actual size? ie: 3 li's, would length be 3 or 2.
[14:37:58] <necromancer> patrick99e99: if you want that you'll have to do $('li > a > img').attr('alt') == 'foo'
[14:38:16] <necromancer> chovy: 3, but there is no index of 3, there's only [0, 1, 2].
[14:38:25] <bitwise_> hi, wondering with $.tmpl how i'd output the property name when iterating through an object. ie: var data = {"1":"foo", "2":"fei"}; $.tmpl('<li>${0}${1}</li>'); // how to make <li>1foo</li><li>2fei</li>
[14:38:29] <SpaG> necromancer, why no attribute selector? wouldn't the method I pasted be better?
[14:38:31] <necromancer> length produces the amount of items in the array
[14:39:34] <necromancer> SpaG: it doesn't really matter. actually the best solution would be var selector = $('li > a'); if(selector.text() == 'foo' || selector.find('img[alt="foo"]').length)
[14:39:55] <necromancer> because you're caching the initial DOM query, that .find() method just queries the original selection
[14:40:04] <necromancer> you don't wanna query the DOM too much
[14:40:13] <SpaG> right
[14:43:19] <chovy> necromancer: thanks.
[14:47:56] <DRSK> chovy ª The replacement you provided up top, any chance it can target a specific div containing the checkboxes to be altered? There are other checkboxes I tend to keep intact.
[14:50:45] <shiftins> where is the second paramter paseed to a jquery selector documented? for instance x=$('body'); y=('.main', x);
[14:51:08] <shiftins> i'm only assuming this is valid since i'm reading code that does this. is there a doc page for it somewhere?
[14:51:25] <phlp> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery1
[14:51:35] <phlp> x is context
[14:51:46] <dabear> shiftins: jQuery( selector [ , context ]  )
[14:51:50] <shiftins> ha, thanks
[14:51:50] <dabear> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[14:52:14] <dabear> shiftins: but rather do $(x).find(".main")
[14:52:22] <tom____> newbie needs a little help here
[14:52:46] <devc> tom____: What's up?
[14:52:52] <tom____> I include an external js file
[14:52:59] <shiftins> thanks dabear, that's what I'm looking in to.. I've always heard .find() is faster, and is my personal preference..
[14:53:07] <tom____> the only line of code in external file is 		$( "#dialog" ).dialog();
[14:53:22] <shiftins> i'm doing a code review for something here at work, and I would like to recommend that, so I'm looking for docs to support find() vs. context
[14:53:42] <tom____> but got an error of Error: $("#dialog").dialog is not a function
[14:53:43] <tom____> Source File: http://localhost/js-test/js/main.js
[14:53:43] <tom____> Line: 3
[14:53:53] <devc> we cant see localhost.
[14:54:02] <DRSK> How can I target checkboxes in a specific div#id ? chovy was kind enough to give me this example: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/ZML9Z/ -- but it targets them all, can someone help me alter it?
[14:54:15] <n8o-mba_> is there a way to change animation delays globally?
[14:54:17] <devc> Any way you could put a small demo up on http://jsfiddle.net for us?
[14:54:43] <ei2matrix> Hi guys! Question: I'm implementing a richtext plugin for a textarea that I show in a dialog. My problem: when I close the dialog and reopen it the textarea appear twice.
[14:54:48] <ei2matrix> some aidea'
[14:54:51] <ei2matrix> idea?
[14:55:08] <phlp> shiftins: look around slide19 of http://paulirish.com/2009/perf
[14:55:09] <shiftins> oh, ha
[14:55:24] <shiftins> yea, i see that the second param just calls .find() anyways
[14:55:25] <tom____> to devc, can you help?
[14:55:28] <shiftins> thanks
[14:55:43] <sneakyness> is there an easier way to go .parent().parent().parent() ?
[14:56:12] <shiftins> $(obj).closest([selector])
[14:57:41] <devc> ei2matrix: could it be if (!$('textarea').length > 0) { create it } else { don't create it; }
[14:58:36] <DRSK> I managed, thanks ªchovy
[14:59:27] <devc> ei2matrix: I'm assuming that you are creating it dynamically, which is why it's doubling it up?
[15:01:12] <ei2matrix> devc:  I set the richtext to the text area on document.read
[15:01:23] <ei2matrix> sorry
[15:01:33] <remx> NaBro, ok I did that and I think it's loaded much quicker. Thanks
[15:02:24] <devaholic> https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery
[15:02:59] <devc> ei2matrix: Is that why it was creating it twice?
[15:03:12] <NaBro> remx: sounds good!
[15:03:12] <ei2matrix> devc: ¬†I set the richtext to the text area on document.ready but in a hidden div, so when I show the dialog it doesn't work. So my idea was load the plugin each time that the event occurs and removing the textarea and setting again
[15:03:47] <devc> Why not just set a variable when the dialog shows, and check against that variable after?
[15:04:41] <takahiro> how do i add a <b></b> within a div at some arbitrary text inside a div, maybe located by regex? <div>Hellothere</div> and the result should be <div>Hello<b></b>there</b></div> (without using .html() to replace the whole div). Any way?
[15:05:05] <takahiro> (sorry, the last </b> is a typo)
[15:05:45] <devc> takahir:  Why do you want to add an empty <b></b> tag?
[15:06:47] <devc> takahiro: Oh sorry, just realised you're the rich text editor guy ;)
[15:07:21] <takahiro> devc: yeah, trying to avoid cursor resetting due to .html() or anything that destroys elements because the range/selector doesn't work once i destroy elements
[15:07:27] <ei2matrix> devc: yes I did it, but when it load again I see everything but I can't format my text
[15:07:49] <takahiro> devc: so if i could <b></b> the vowels without mass div content replacement, then it wouldn't break the cursor positions
[15:08:45] <devc> takahiro: what about instead of .html() using .val()? To be honest I dont really know what you're doing at all, just trying to think up suggestions.
[15:09:12] <devc> ei2matrix: what type of dialog is this that you're working with?
[15:09:26] <ei2matrix> jquery ui dialog
[15:09:35] <ei2matrix> as modal
[15:10:36] <devc> ei2matrix: And is it taking information from the textarea? I dunno why it would be unsetting the rich text editor
[15:10:47] <devc> Any chance you can put somethin up on jsfiddle.net?
[15:10:56] <takahiro> devc: once the contents of the element changes, the position is lost - so i need to be able to add and remove elements within the div at any text position
[15:11:32] <DRSK> How do I find a specific word in a element #id and replace by another word?
[15:12:07] <ei2matrix> devc: I'm taking info from a label, not the textarea
[15:13:20] <ei2matrix> devc: now I setted a flag var for check and when I reopen I see not duplicated but I can't edit or insert text into the textarea
[15:16:41] <devc> ei2matrix: throw me a jsfiddle.net
[15:18:12] <scar2> im using the Dialog jQuery-- how do i keep it fixed? i tried position: fixed and it jacked t all up
[15:18:21] <scar2> i can scroll with my mouse. modal doesn work either on it
[15:19:39] <ei2matrix> devc: http://jsfiddle.net/vGjnK/
[15:22:11] <devc> ei2matrix: cuando toque 'grabar' no pas√≥ nada tampoco tienes jquery ni javascript para empaza showCommentDialog()
[15:22:14] <devc> ;)
[15:22:51] <ei2matrix> devc: es que solo pegue las funciones
[15:22:55] <ei2matrix> no el trigger
[15:23:36] <ei2matrix> devc: spanish! que groso de donde?
[15:24:11] <whatthepoop> using draggable/sortable elements, is it possible (or at least not crazy) to force certain elements to snap to other elements in a vertical list based on type/id? for instance, in a list with three types of elements (A, B, and C), elements of type A only snap to elements of type B, but not to C.. or elements of type C only snap *between* elements of A and B, but not elements of C and B
[15:24:25] <devc> por eso. la funciona de jsfiddle es para tratar el funciones y proba las opciones. No s√© que pasa porque no conozco que es $(this) o que.
[15:24:52] <devc> hahah soy gringo pero vivia en argentina y colombia por unos a√±os. No hablo mucho pero suficiente a comunicar... barely ;)
[15:25:09] <necromancer> how do i make a PUT request with jQuery?
[15:25:13] <necromancer> oh wait n/m
[15:25:14] <necromancer> sorry
[15:25:21] <mtbf> Do I have to attach ajaxComplete to some existing element, or can I just simply call $.ajaxComplete(function(e,x){}) to catch every XML object retrieved with any ajax call (both .ajax and .post for instnace)?
[15:26:46] <remx> can anyone recommend a plugin to set browser cache headers?
[15:26:51] <ei2matrix> devc: :) genial, soy Argentino pero no de BsAs. El tema es que no puedo copiar toda la funcionalidad‚Ä¶ com ohago? plugins, todo el html, etc
[15:28:10] <devc> ei2matrix: dale... tenes el url a ver en tu pagina? sino es 'internal'
[15:28:13] <devc> boludo! ;)
[15:28:37] <ei2matrix> jaja no che!, es interno
[15:28:58] <devc> jajaj CHE! ya hace 2 a√±os desde lo escucho, che.
[15:29:16] <devc> Damn man, I dunno then. That's hard to say.
[15:29:18] <ei2matrix> estuviste por cordoba?
[15:29:57] <devc> claaaro. ... solo para fiesta de cervezitas y mi amiga tiene una radio se llama "radio crema" desde cordoba.
[15:30:28] <ei2matrix> devc: entonces habras escuchado el "culiao" lo dicen todo el tiempo
[15:30:47] <devc> claro.
[15:31:05] <devc> Are you from Cordoba then?
[15:31:36] <devc> Mike Bifari es de Cordoba, cierto?
[15:31:40] <ei2matrix> bueno aca en La Pampa lo decimos tambien
[15:31:49] <ei2matrix> yo de La Pampa
[15:31:57] <devc> y donde aprendiste ingles?
[15:32:04] <ei2matrix> solo
[15:32:17] <ei2matrix> mucho tiempo leyendo manuales
[15:32:19] <ei2matrix> jaja
[15:32:21] <devc> bien boludo! super bien
[15:32:29] <devc> I guess as a programmer you have to -- most are in English.
[15:32:39] <ei2matrix> uhh en serio? graciasss eso si que me levanta la auto estima
[15:32:39] <chovy> DRSK: $("#divId input[type=checkbox]")
[15:32:47] <aca20031> stupid spanish word 'aca'
[15:32:58] <ei2matrix> jaja
[15:33:13] <devc> HAHAH aqui entonces, pelotudo
[15:33:27] <devc> o en colombia, "marika"
[15:33:51] <ei2matrix> devc: No se si me explique bien, mi ingles no es bueno como tu espa√±ol jaja. El tema es que si lo cargo en document ready cuando muestro el div oculto se ve el  plugin pero no el textarea, si lo pongo en la funcion me lo duplica. Ahora, si le pongo el flag entonces me recarga bien, pero el plugin no toma texto, nada ni el cursor se puede poner
[15:33:57] <devc> People are gonna think this is a spanish jquery channel. I just like practising when I can since I don't live there.
[15:33:59] <imsky> whoa
[15:34:52] <ei2matrix> devc: si se enojan cambiamos de idioma, pero es bueno encontrar por aqui spanish
[15:34:52] <jaequery> anyone here knows a thing or two about math?
[15:34:56] <jaequery> let's say i can get the spread doing:  spread = ( price - cost / price ) ....    now let's say i already know the spread and want to get the price instead?!?  o_O
[15:35:22] <devc> jaequery: Yeah man, didn't you learn algebra in school? DAMN ;)
[15:35:33] <devc> Give me a second with ei2matrix and I'll see if I can work it out for you ;)
[15:36:12] <ei2matrix> devc: :)
[15:37:05] <devc> ei2matrix:  div oculto = el dialog?
[15:37:27] <jaequery> like 10 years ago?
[15:37:31] <ei2matrix> devc: si, lo uso para mostrar el contenido del dialog
[15:37:55] <jaequery> i dont know why schools teach that junk when i dont even use it, other than like once in a blue moon like today
[15:38:01] <jaequery> lol
[15:38:44] <devc> ei2matrix: and you're taking information from the dialog from a label/textinput?
[15:39:43] <ei2matrix> devc: from a div
[15:39:55] <ei2matrix> but that works fine
[15:41:13] <ei2matrix> no, from another place, generated table
[15:41:51] <devc> jaequery: price = square root of spread + cost
[15:42:05] <ei2matrix> devc: I have a table that I generate dinamically and I get the info from it
[15:42:22] <etangle> m using jquery periodical updater to update some records on a page, and using jquery pagination to paginate those records, when I am on say page 3, updater takes me to page 1 everytime it updates !!!
[15:43:25] <jaequery> thanks devc, you are a GENIUS
[15:43:46] <devc> hahaha I dunno either man it's been 10 years since I did it but I guess it stuck in my head better ;)
[15:43:52] <devc> I THINK that's correct though.
[15:43:56] <imsky> hmmm
[15:44:02] <imsky> how did you get that, devc?
[15:44:20] <ei2matrix> devc: but I'm taking the info ok‚Ä¶ My problem is the plugin when I try to reuse it more than once
[15:44:43] <devc> ei2matrix: y no queres una refresh obviamente?
[15:44:50] <devc> imsky:  Is it wrong?
[15:45:12] <jaequery> i have to be 100 % absolutely shure
[15:45:13] <imsky> devc, not sure if i'm missing anything, but where did the sqrt come from?
[15:45:26] <ei2matrix> devc: es que si hago un refresh pierdo todo el contenido generado y hay que seleccionar varios dropdows de nuevo
[15:45:29] <devc> imsky: oh crap, maybe it is. jaequery it's not right. hold on
[15:45:53] <devc> ei2matrix: ah claro, esperate un segundo
[15:45:58] * jaequery thought devc was a genius ...
[15:46:13] <imsky> sounds to me like it's price = -(cost/(spread-1))
[15:46:23] <ei2matrix> devc: sisi
[15:48:25] <devc> imsky: Anywhere we can have a dual drawing board? I wanna see the steps -- I believe it, just don't know how you got there
[15:49:16] <imsky> devc i guess i'm confused as to how he divides it.. the way i parsed it is spread = (price-cost)/price
[15:49:29] <imsky> is it price-(cost/price)?
[15:49:39] <devc> That second one is what I was thinking
[15:49:45] <imsky> ok let me check that one
[15:49:51] <devc> I thought the bracketts were coming from javascript
[15:49:56] <devc> brackets*
[15:50:22] <imsky> ok the second way is a little more complicated
[15:50:24] <snover> PEMDAS, imsky.
[15:50:37] <devc> lol it's BEDMAS ;)
[15:50:54] <imsky> don't be telling me operator precedence
[15:50:55] <imsky> dick
[15:51:10] <devc> Brackets, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction
[15:51:37] <jaequery> imsky, you are a genius
[15:51:46] <imsky> so the first way was correct?
[15:51:50] <jaequery> yea
[15:51:55] <snover> I promise that it is a correct version of the mnemonic, devc.
[15:51:59] <imsky> well you're welcome bud
[15:52:13] <jaequery> howd you get so smart
[15:52:30] <devc> snover: M and D are equal, so it's possible. I was just joking because that's how I'd learned it
[15:52:33] <jaequery> and why are you in #jquery, with your brains you should be working for nuclear collider
[15:52:38] <devc> It could just as easily be BEMDSA
[15:53:26] <devc> I call foul. We were given an incorrect starting statement. HAHA
[15:53:53] <devc> s=(p-c/p) is not the same as s=(p-c)/p
[15:54:12] <imsky> jaequery: lol
[15:54:39] <devc> Although my answer was incorrect either way.
[15:55:36] <jaequery> devc: ok i give you some recognition for trying
[15:55:51] <jaequery> you guys are all too smart for #jquery IMO
[15:56:08] <devc> PHEW.. I'll call off the hitman.
[15:56:21] <devaholic> check this out... https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery
[15:56:38] <devaholic> bind events in jquery to things that happen on the server?
[15:56:46] <chovy> interesting
[15:56:58] <devc> ei2matrix: de verdad no entiendo porque se hace pero me parece que es una pregunta por el autor del plugin
[15:57:29] <ei2matrix> devc: que problema :S conoces algun otro plugin?
[15:57:49] <devaholic> the API in nodequery is just like jquery except a lot of the calls are async
[15:57:57] <devc> no. soy un noobie tambien che.
[15:58:34] <jaequery> i dont get it
[15:58:38] <jaequery> @nquery
[15:58:49] <jaequery> i dont see where the benefit is
[15:59:18] <devaholic> jaequery: how about binding swipe events directly to the server?
[15:59:25] <devaholic> or mouse position?
[15:59:34] <devaholic> but there is tons of applications
[16:00:00] <jaequery> oh so it's streaming?
[16:00:04] <jaequery> via sockets?
[16:00:13] <devaholic> whenever it does anything it does it in real time
[16:00:14] <devaholic> yes
[16:00:20] <devaholic> socket.io
[16:00:37] <jaequery> what if browser doesn't support flash/html5
[16:00:43] <devaholic> doesnt matter
[16:00:50] <devaholic> it will fall back to other transport methods
[16:00:52] <devaholic> $('.clickable').live('click', function () {
[16:00:57] <devaholic> $('.form').serialize(console.log);
[16:01:01] <devaholic> });
[16:01:15] <devaholic> 3 lines of code to get your form data on the server
[16:01:25] <devaholic> (and its freaking instant)
[16:01:36] <jaequery> is that code you posted, on server or on client
[16:01:43] <devaholic> on the server
[16:01:48] <Whirl3d> is it just impossible to get the width of an empty element that has a defined width, height and set to display:block?
[16:01:53] <ei2matrix> devc: uhh bueno gracias!! Un placer che, mi skype por si necesitas algo manuel.simpson mas o menos me manejo
[16:02:03] <jaequery> damn thats like, a paradigm shift in coding
[16:02:05] <devaholic> you dont actually have to write client side code any more when you use nQuery, but you still can of course
[16:02:19] <devaholic> jaequery, yes hugely!
[16:02:36] <devaholic> jaequery, you know what else it does?
[16:02:54] <devaholic> reduces overall KB transferred
[16:03:04] <devaholic> reduces page load by 200-1000%
[16:03:18] <jaequery> hm, interesting
[16:03:18] <snover> wow that‚Äôs gross.
[16:03:27] <devaholic> you see why, though
[16:03:44] <jaequery> did you develop nquery?
[16:03:44] <devaholic> you dont have a bunch of assets to serve to every client, they just stay on the server
[16:03:51] <devaholic> you are only ever sending out tiny bits of html
[16:03:53] <devaholic> yes
[16:04:15] <devaholic> and still am...
[16:04:24] <jaequery> dam , forget the other dues, i think YOU are a genius
[16:04:25] <snover> messing with the dom directly is the wrong thing to do in a webapp, trying to do it from the server is even worse.
[16:04:43] <devaholic> snover: i beg to differ
[16:05:07] <devaholic> snover: for some apps with complicated visuals, i.e. canvas, nodequery is not yet they right tool for the job
[16:05:18] <jaequery> it's worse if your head is still wrapped in with stateless HTTP protocol
[16:05:21] <snover> what?
[16:05:30] <devaholic> but for most traditional apps, that only consist of basic dom manipulation and text manipulation, it only benefits...
[16:05:37] <snover> um, no‚Ä¶
[16:05:43] <imsky> yeah no, not really
[16:05:51] <devaholic> actually, it does, and i can tell you why
[16:05:57] <jaequery> this is almost, web 3.0 material
[16:06:02] <devaholic> for one? empirical evidence
[16:06:18] <snover> you are introducing the spaghetti code concept taken from php to server-side javascript
[16:06:18] <snover> please stop
[16:06:21] <devaholic> the benchmarks show that nodequery todos is faster and loads less data than backbone.js todos (am exact app)
[16:06:24] <devaholic> same*
[16:06:32] <imsky> todos != complex crud app
[16:06:46] <jaequery> can you imagine a website constantly, just loading? like when a news event comes out, it loads up, notification, everything real time, like that thing in tom cruise movie
[16:06:52] <devaholic> snover: it is not spaghetti code any more than your jquery in your backbone app is spaghetti code
[16:06:57] <imsky> this sounds like x windowing...
[16:06:57] <devaholic> you are just being difficult, snover
[16:07:12] <snover> devaholic: no, i‚Äôm being someone that has had to deal with the outcomes of people that think the dom is a great place for everything
[16:07:39] <jaequery> i think this isn't more about DOM, it's more about websockets
[16:07:53] <devaholic> jaequery: yes exactly :P, not to mention you can stream the same DOM state to lots of people, so everyone could be "watching" the same view, and most of the complex logic it would normally take to attain that is inherit in nodequery
[16:07:58] <jaequery> and nquery seems to be a good tool for that type of stuff
[16:08:12] <devaholic> its about not writing in 2 environments
[16:08:38] <devaholic> its about treating all of the clients connected to your server as views to keep updated, rather than applications to keep updated
[16:08:41] <snover> you don‚Äôt write in 2 environments when you use cometd or similar. you pass the data from the server because that is the only thing the server should be responsible for.
[16:09:21] <devaholic> snover: but you must have misread earlier when i talked about benchmarks, or what nQuery can do to make real-time apps more performant and easier to write
[16:09:37] <devaholic> nQuery loads up a 40kb page no matter how huge your site is
[16:09:37] <imsky> is it nquery or nodequery
[16:09:41] <jaequery> this is like, one up backbone/knockout/angular , w/ 2 way dom binding, this is now like 3 way dom binding
[16:09:45] <devaholic> same thing, imsky
[16:09:58] <imsky> hmm nquery gets nothing on google, nodequery does
[16:10:10] <devaholic> well, i have only jsut released it
[16:10:16] <devaholic> and nodequery.com is NOT affiliated...
[16:10:34] <imsky> so why would you give your project two names
[16:10:47] <devaholic> its nodequery
[16:10:52] <imsky> nQuery.js
[16:10:54] <jaequery> i like nquery
[16:10:59] <snover> what you are doing is deferring an initial (cacheable!) load for re-transferring redundant data over and over again
[16:11:01] <devaholic> then call it nquery...
[16:11:06] <snover> throughout the lifecycle of the application
[16:11:07] <jaequery> nodequery makes it sound like, just another node app
[16:11:19] <devaholic> snover, everything can be cached man
[16:11:34] <devaholic> thoughts on a better name then? lol..
[16:11:39] <jaequery> who cares about cache, we aren't living in 56k modems anymore
[16:12:08] <jaequery> or are you
[16:12:43] <imsky> so let me get this straight...whenever a new tweet gets posted, the traditional approach is 1. get tweet json 2. append it to dom. the nquery approach is 1. get code to append tweet to dom
[16:12:53] <jaequery> i heard a talk about web 3.0 but this seems like that type of framework
[16:13:28] <devaholic> imsky: the tweets example on github is a bit redundant because you *could* just get those tweets with ajax
[16:13:29] <jaequery> where website is like an interactive operating system
[16:13:43] <imsky> devaholic: i just made that up
[16:13:50] <imsky> point is, you got the code overhead every time
[16:13:56] <devaholic> well there is actually a running example on there, check it :P
[16:14:04] <jaequery> any live example url?
[16:14:29] <devaholic> i was just trying to get the todos examples running on nodejitsu, but got distracted with this chat
[16:14:47] <devaholic> imsky: you dont have the same amount of computation overhead
[16:14:56] <jaequery> will this conflict with node's own jquery module?
[16:15:07] <devaholic> imsky: you dont have to serve up both the information for your dom, as well as the logic to put that information into a DOM-like state
[16:15:07] <jaequery> nodejs's*
[16:15:16] <devaholic> you only have to serve up the DOM...
[16:15:19] <snover> devaholic: what are you talking about? you just moved a bunch of the computational overhead to the server.
[16:15:22] <devaholic> it cuts out a lot of stuff
[16:15:35] <snover> how is *that* more scalable?
[16:15:52] <devaholic> snover: reread the last thing i said
[16:16:04] <imsky> oh yeah...and the tweet polling is all done serverside, so the load is moved to the server on that too
[16:16:04] <devaholic> apps dont just move to the server, they become an order of magnitude smaller
[16:16:09] <snover> wut
[16:16:21] <devaholic> there is no longer 2 apps
[16:16:34] <imsky> so instead of 100 machines polling individually, you got 1 machine polling once and pushing it to 100 clients
[16:16:35] <jaequery> have you done any load testing?
[16:16:58] <devaholic> imsky, can we agree the tweet example of polling is a bad example?
[16:17:05] <devaholic> because it can be done anywhere....
[16:17:13] <imsky> first thing that came to mind
[16:17:23] <imsky> how about a calculator app
[16:17:27] <devaholic> well i wouldnt advise you do something like that in nquery but it is possible
[16:17:33] <jaequery> any realtime server, usually takes a toll on scalability ...
[16:17:37] <snover> what *is* the target application for this thing, devaholic?
[16:17:43] <jaequery> by a magnitude
[16:17:44] <imsky> calculator apps snover
[16:17:47] <devaholic> nodequery lets you write client side javascript ALSO... if you want
[16:18:05] <Elephant> :]
[16:18:10] <jaequery> devaholic, but how secure is this
[16:18:11] <devaholic> snover: aye, it is for real time apps
[16:18:22] <jaequery> like form submissions
[16:18:35] <snover> devaholic: it would suck pretty hugely for a real-time stock information app
[16:18:55] <devaholic> i dont see how you can confidently make that assumption
[16:19:03] <snover> or a real-time drawing app, or a real-time game app
[16:19:06] <devaholic> i would say the exact opposite
[16:19:13] <jaequery> i always felt that, POST/GET, can soon be replaced with sockets ...
[16:19:25] <imsky> snover: what is going on today
[16:19:26] <snover> devaholic: because you are adding hundreds of bytes of DOM overhead for each data transfer
[16:19:29] <devaholic> it would be perfect for this, you wont get a better response...
[16:19:33] <jaequery> but, has anyone dont any research in security with sockets?
[16:19:37] <jaequery> done*
[16:19:41] <ThePendulum> HTML5 WebSocket
[16:19:47] <devc> I love seeing heated discussion like this. It's a shame I'm off work for tha muthafucken weekend and am outta here
[16:19:48] <devc> WOOOO!@#
[16:19:54] <devc> Happy Halloween, guys!
[16:19:57] <devc> See ya Monday
[16:19:58] <devaholic> jaequery: yes... every time you would have had a new http request? just call $('body').html()
[16:19:58] <Elephant> yeah, they are terribly insecure
[16:20:01] <jaequery> lata
[16:20:38] <snover> want to update 2 or 3 different places using the same data? well shit son, now you gotta send the same data 2 or 3 times
[16:20:39] <jaequery> i guess its gotta be more secure than post/get
[16:20:40] <snover> plus the markup
[16:20:41] <snover> EVERY TIME
[16:20:51] <snover> instead of just doing it the right way and sending the *data* to the client
[16:21:05] <devaholic> snover: in a *real* benchmark? that small amount of HTML overheard (btw html is not a far cry from xml) is better than the initial page load, json transfer, view transfers, etc
[16:21:18] <snover> xml is a fucking terrible data exchange format too
[16:21:24] <Elephant> are we trying to reinvent http now
[16:21:25] <ThePendulum> Guys... I¬¥m terribly sorry to get inbetween this lovely conversation. But could someone please give me some feedback on the placeholder jQuery plugin?
[16:21:33] <Elephant> what on earth are you guys even talking about
[16:21:55] <devaholic> snover: as an example, the todos app will transmit about 200kb of data after 10 minute of use, with about 45kb loaded initially, the *same app* running on backbone.js will transmit 350kb of data, 200kb of which comes on the initial load
[16:22:14] <devaholic> snover: agreed... but as terrible as it is, it is still professionally viable
[16:22:18] <snover> so what you are saying is
[16:22:30] <devaholic> Elephant: https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery
[16:22:37] <jaequery> devaholic, if i'm not doing anything on the site, would it still transmitting data to the server?
[16:22:42] <ThePendulum> Nevermind :¬¥)
[16:23:02] <devaholic> jaequery: no, just heartbeats to keep the connection open depending on which transport protocol your browser can handle
[16:23:27] <jaequery> yeah i like this idea.... but i feel developers gonna hate it
[16:23:37] <devaholic> people that grip on paradigm shift will hate it
[16:23:40] <snover> devaholic: pick a non-trivial app and your economies of scale come crashing down
[16:23:44] <jaequery> because, it's too radical
[16:23:49] <devaholic> like you said before... it is a massive paradigm shift
[16:23:56] <devaholic> there are massive benefits too... you cant just ignore them
[16:24:11] <devaholic> snover... that doesnt make sense
[16:24:11] <jaequery> i mean i saw something similar to this
[16:24:17] <snover> no, it really isn‚Äôt a paradigm shift. client-server applications have existed for a long, long time.
[16:24:28] <jaequery> they raised some money too recently
[16:24:31] <snover> you have basically reimplemented x11
[16:24:33] <snover> using javascript
[16:24:34] <snover> good job
[16:24:35] <imsky> this isn't a big shift, it's x11
[16:24:42] <devaholic> snover: it treats a browser as a "view" into an application, which is IIRC the traditional way
[16:24:45] <snover> ?eval hi5("imsky", "snover")
[16:24:49] <bot-t> snover: "imsky _o/\o_ snover"
[16:24:52] <imsky> lol
[16:25:12] <snover> devaholic: yes, traditional because thin clients COULD NOT DO IT.
[16:25:15] <snover> not better.
[16:25:16] <jaequery> it's like, Cloud OS, coming near you
[16:25:22] <jaequery> powered by, nodeQuery
[16:25:26] <bapi_> Hey, I have a couple of divs, now, is there any way of making so that the div that is hovered fades out to 100% opacity, and when the mouse leaves it returns to 0
[16:25:26] <snover> there was not enough processing power on the thin client to do this stuff
[16:25:28] <devaholic> snover: paradigm means the way you go about solving the problem that your program fixes... this is a paradigm shift because that becomes different, not because its a client-server (which has obviously been around)
[16:25:30] <snover> so it had to be shitty
[16:25:46] <bapi_> fades in*
[16:26:00] <jaequery> this is a novel concept, it will even effectively eliminate cross-domain issues
[16:26:28] <imsky> because you moved xdm to the server
[16:26:54] <imsky> kinda like...a proxy
[16:26:58] <devaholic> snover: i still dont understand why you fail to see the benefits, and you have yet to introduce any pitfalls
[16:27:13] <jaequery> devaholic, this is scary stuff
[16:27:15] <bakedace> http://jsfiddle.net/pHCMK/9/ please help
[16:27:23] <devaholic> the only real pitfall atm, is that you cant do everything with it that you can do with the DOM
[16:27:47] <devaholic> but no one even mentioned that
[16:28:20] <jaequery> devaholic, can you just make an example so that it handles basic form submissions not usin POST/GET?
[16:28:22] <imsky> devaholic: here's a non-trivial example. a user has a datepicker in a table row and adds a new table row. the datepicker html and js bindings have to be sent over and over again
[16:28:30] <devaholic> snover and imsky too busy gripping over the paradigm shift because of unknown reasons to see why/where something like this would be useful
[16:28:35] <jaequery> because, that is one way to get peoples attention
[16:28:40] <snover> devaholic: pitfall 1. You just moved a bunch of computational complexity from the client to the server. 2. You just bloated the amount of data sent from the client to the server. 3. You just ruined responsive interface because everything requires an RTT to the server before anything happens. 4. You just defeated caching.
[16:28:43] <jaequery> without making their head hurt
[16:29:05] <daleharvey> is there any way to fix $("<div><![CDATA[test]]></div>").html(); = "<!--[CDATA[test]]-->"
[16:29:11] <devaholic> snover: i'm happy to address those points
[16:29:28] <devaholic> 1: it actually reduces computational complexity
[16:29:43] <snover> bro, you just took all the code that would normally run on the client and just shoved it on the server
[16:29:49] <snover> that is not reducing computational complexity on the server
[16:29:53] <imsky> devaholic : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System#Design
[16:29:56] <jaequery> this is like, streaming website ... but you need a better examples
[16:30:02] <devaholic> 2. is going to be dependent on any given programmer or app, and you can make that mistake regardless of nodequery
[16:30:15] <imsky> 24+ year old design
[16:30:26] <devaholic> 3 is the opposite of true, and btw you can still run client side code and transfer state if you want
[16:30:28] <snover> bro, you are advocating sending redundant HTML EVERY REQUEST.
[16:30:35] <imsky> snover: and js bindings
[16:30:47] <snover> if you run client side code you have just defeated the entire purpose of your entire project and you might as well just do it the right way
[16:31:12] <devaholic> snover: not if its for something that only lives in a  view
[16:31:34] <devaholic> snover: as for the HTML EVERY REQUEST, you are sending json every request? did you forget about benchmarks and empirical data?
[16:31:45] <devaholic> you are claiming something of HTMl that is not true
[16:31:45] <jaequery> snover: i understand your points and all that, but you gotta think, this isn't for websites. but more for like, future of the web, it's way down the line, 5-10 years from now
[16:31:54] <imsky> heh how do you test these apps
[16:32:05] <imsky> "let's wait until all the requests come in, in perfect order"
[16:32:15] <snover> jaequery: I am writing those ‚Äúfuture of the web‚Äù apps today, my friend, and they do not involve HTML as a data exchange format.
[16:32:16] <devaholic> wrapping data in <li>'s instead of "" is not going to add substantial load times to anything
[16:32:37] <jaequery> oh then show us
[16:32:38] <jaequery> lol
[16:32:46] <snover> jaequery: I can‚Äôt show you, I‚Äôm under NDA.
[16:33:00] <devaholic> snover: i think you just said why you dont like the idea, you think your competiting idea is better
[16:33:05] <bapi_> im looking for 2 jquery actions "mouse in IN/ON element" and "mouse leaves element"
[16:33:17] <imsky> ?mouseenter @ bapi_
[16:33:18] <bot-t> bapi_, .mouseenter(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[16:33:23] <imsky> ?mouseleave @ bapi_
[16:33:24] <bot-t> bapi_, .mouseleave(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[16:33:28] <bapi_> great, thanks
[16:33:31] <jaequery> well i created something thats a bit ahead of the time too, it's stiqr.com , dont know if any of you seen it
[16:33:38] <devaholic> imsky: the RPC calls are always in order, unless the connection drops
[16:33:55] <jaequery> it's like, web design paradigm shift
[16:34:01] <devaholic> imsky: but at that point the app has ended anyways
[16:34:04] <imsky> devaholic: how are they always in order? what if one call gets latency...
[16:34:10] <imsky> does the app just stall...
[16:34:25] <devaholic> imsky: itwill wait for that call, and potentially end the connection
[16:34:30] <snover> devaholic: my competing idea? my competing idea is a decade of best practices and proven solutions that do not have any of the caveats and maintenance issues of what you are proposing
[16:34:35] <devaholic> that shouldnt ever happen, though
[16:34:53] <devaholic> snover there are fewer caveats and maintenance issues
[16:35:06] <devaholic> its a reduction in overall complexity
[16:35:16] <imsky> what if a request times out? then you have broken state
[16:35:17] <snover> no. it is not. it is the *perception* of a reduction of complexity
[16:35:21] <jaequery> hey devaholic what do you think about stiqr.com? i feel like yours and mine kind of go hand in hand, where stiqr handles the visual piece of the website
[16:35:23] <snover> because you have failed to properly abstract things
[16:35:38] <devaholic> its the difference between having 1 app that communicates with 1..n apps that each communicate with 1..n views, or having 1 app that communicates with 1..n views
[16:35:58] <bakedace> what is the best way to check if any set of elements are being hovered?
[16:36:08] <devaholic> the project is in beta, if you are talking about any specific LOC i'd be interested to hear whats wrong
[16:36:37] <snover> devaholic: you just said that your requests are guaranteed to be in order, which means that if one of them is slow to respond because the server is busy processing it, everything else is stuck waiting for it.
[16:36:37] <bakedace> if anything in a set of elemtsn is being hovered*
[16:36:39] <Whirl3d> If I have a div with a background image (to be used as a sprite with various states hidden), how can I find the width/height of it to animate it? The div, not the bg image?
[16:37:00] <snover> and let‚Äôs all repeat together, guys
[16:37:04] <snover> javascript is single threaded
[16:37:07] <imsky> and if a request times out or is never received, then the state is not synchronous across clients
[16:37:20] <devaholic> snover: that doesnt happen... but btw the same effect will be had on any application, regardless if it is using nodequery
[16:37:23] <imsky> and future requests can't depend on the state
[16:37:33] <snover> you can use web workers but the main thread still needs to not be blocked or you cannot handle other requests
[16:37:57] <snover> but anyway, it doesn‚Äôt really matter
[16:38:08] <devaholic> you could easily cluster out a nodequery app with workers
[16:38:10] <takahiro> any tips on how to make the cursor not jump to the beginning of new elements when typing? bug shown here: http://thorie.com/rich/test2.html
[16:38:10] <snover> mostly I just wanted to remind people that fucking around with the DOM from the server is wrong
[16:38:17] <devaholic> i designed it for that from the start, just fyi
[16:38:18] <snover> devaholic: that sounds very ‚Äúless complex‚Äù :|
[16:38:51] <devaholic> you dont have to *think* about workers when you design the app to work as 1..n copies
[16:38:52] <snover> I‚Äôm certainly not expecting you to say ‚Äúoh wow you are right snover i have this all wrong‚Äù
[16:38:59] <snover> devaholic: good job! you just reimplemented php.
[16:39:03] <jaequery> snover, that's what people used to say about DOM before js got popular too
[16:39:18] <devaholic> snover: you are just being a hater now, i know you really like my idea :P
[16:39:20] <snover> jaequery: you do not know what you are talking about.
[16:39:21] <bapi_> ehm, after I use fadeOut the element becomes innaccesible, I want the element to go to 0 opactity, but it should also be able to hover on that area for it to revert to 1 opacity
[16:39:23] <bapi_> solutions?
[16:39:36] <jaequery> lol, yea i made that up
[16:39:38] <imsky> bapi_: animate opacity
[16:39:49] <devaholic> follow it on github for updates and such
[16:39:52] <Whirl3d> ?animate @ bapi
[16:39:52] <bot-t> bapi, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:39:55] <snover> devaholic: no, I don‚Äôt. jQuery developers have this idea that the DOM is this amazing miracle cream that they can rub on every app they write and make it amazing
[16:40:00] <snover> and you can‚Äôt
[16:40:00] <imsky> lol clustering out a nodequery app...
[16:40:18] <imsky> so now you have threading and mutexes on top of messaging to present views to the user
[16:40:22] <jaequery> clustering node.js app is easy ... especially with the cloud and all
[16:40:27] <Whirl3d> more like yogurt than a cream
[16:40:28] <devaholic> DOM is an api, not whatever you are implying...
[16:40:30] <Whirl3d> similar, though
[16:40:46] <phishy> snover: actually jquery developers usually hate the dom
[16:40:52] <jaequery> not many people worked with sockets to the point there is a need for sockets , yet
[16:40:56] <phishy> and wish it wouldn't suck so much
[16:41:14] <snover> phishy: haha, no, they hate cross-browser compatibility issues
[16:41:27] <snover> and the verbose API
[16:41:34] <phishy> snover: agreed
[16:41:35] <snover> they looooooove the DOM.
[16:41:35] <devaholic> phishy: https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery
[16:41:47] <jaequery> devaholic, what this is good for, is, if you can create hosted "API"S for like blogs/ecommerce/etc ... using your platform
[16:41:54] <BinaryKitten> never heard of anyone say the love the DOM.
[16:42:12] <BinaryKitten> but the DOM isn't going anywhere for web apps
[16:42:16] <bapi_> thanks, animate did the trick :D
[16:42:27] <devaholic> jaequery: you could write a real-time chat in about 7 lines of code on top of the "hello world"
[16:42:30] <jaequery> so on your server, you have all these apps that can be accessed on-demand for anyone to use
[16:42:34] <snover> Where should I put my data? I know, the DOM! How should I create widgets? I know, create a function on $.fn!
[16:43:08] <snover> How should I transfer data? I know, using HTML! That I can just inject to the DOM!
[16:43:12] <phishy> snover: there used to be nowhere to put the data but the DOM ;-)
[16:43:26] <devaholic> snover: empirical evidence
[16:43:32] <devaholic> snover: you cant argue with it
[16:43:36] <devaholic> snover: nuff said
[16:44:09] <imsky> jaequery: what problem does stiqr solve?
[16:44:13] <snover> devaholic: argumentum ad populum.
[16:44:16] <snover> nuff said.
[16:44:16] <imsky> i've been playing around with it for like 5 minutes
[16:44:30] <devaholic> if transferring REST ends up being better done with HTML rather than XML or JSON, then HTML will be used................
[16:44:32] <jaequery> imsky, it should be quite obvious ...
[16:44:42] <imsky> jaequery: ok i'm an investor in your idea, pitch me
[16:44:59] <jaequery> ok
[16:45:12] <devaholic> snover: you are in #jquery
[16:45:30] <jaequery> tumblr users, theres millions of em. none of these users know how to customize their blogs. but with stiqr , you can.
[16:46:22] <devaholic> basically you can turn any site into geocities?
[16:46:42] <jaequery> im now focusing on apps though, not too much about design, but things like, follow me on twitter side docks, leave me a message, stuff like getsatifscation does that lives on the side
[16:46:55] <mtbf> Hey guys, I'd like to make some catchall function to alert all <error> XML tags encountered on the output from every ajax call, what's the best/easies way of achieving this?
[16:47:11] <jaequery> devaholic, yes , maybe even worse
[16:47:13] <jaequery> lol
[16:47:15] <imsky> jaequery: after they're done making changes, how do they get the HTML to use on their site?
[16:47:24] <imsky> html/css/js that is
[16:47:31] <jaequery> its loaded ajax
[16:47:38] <devaholic> probably just include a js file is all...
[16:47:46] <imsky> oh ok so you're going to load style info for a site with ajax
[16:48:08] <devaholic> jaequery: yeah you could totally write this in nodequery
[16:48:15] <jaequery> stiqr is, like api server that saves data ...
[16:48:30] <mtbf> I tried $.ajaxComplete() without attaching it to any element, but it doesn't trigger for $.post() call, so it doesn't meet my requirement.
[16:48:37] <jaequery> currently pushing around 2m+/month
[16:48:53] <devaholic> getsatisfaction and other real time social apps are about 10x easier in nodequery too
[16:49:09] <imsky> jaequery: impressive. how do i layer two elements?
[16:49:17] <imsky> that is, how can i put one image behind another?
[16:49:38] <jaequery> theres , send back / send forward
[16:49:52] <jaequery> right click it
[16:50:10] <imsky> oh yeah i see it now
[16:50:33] <jaequery> it can even load any widgets, lazy-style!
[16:51:03] <jaequery> i have to clear out my images/apps though, those were just like, me proving to myself that it can actually work
[16:51:10] <jaequery> so it was all just test stuff
[16:51:36] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: demo password doesn't seem  to be working on demo-1
[16:51:41] <imsky> and demo-2
[16:51:46] <jaequery> yeah, i know
[16:51:50] <jaequery> im too lazy
[16:51:55] <Elephant> Would someone tell me if it's a bad idea to pass two selectors to a function and do some .post?
[16:52:19] <Elephant> a predefined function
[16:52:55] <jaequery> you can check out my jaequery.tumblr.com
[16:52:59] <bakedace> so is getting help here pretty much impossible?
[16:53:03] <imsky> jaequery: yeah i think i found a use for it https://minus.com/lvtfm9XAD2oOk
[16:53:12] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: did you make that?
[16:53:19] <jaequery> its all designed by some high schooler who only knows how to draw
[16:53:35] <jaequery> so for me, that showcases power of what stiqr can do... anyone that just draw can use this
[16:54:28] <devaholic> hmm
[16:54:37] <devaholic> stiqr makes more sense that more i look at it
[16:54:43] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: is stiqr yours?
[16:54:49] <jaequery> ryanneufeld, yes
[16:54:54] <ryanneufeld> dude...
[16:54:58] <ryanneufeld> niiiice
[16:55:05] <jaequery> hah thanks
[16:55:21] <jaequery> im gonna go back into private beta mode soon though
[16:55:34] <devaholic> jaequery: you could like, offer 1 stiqr on site.com for $1/visit
[16:55:37] <jaequery> got a big update in UI and site
[16:55:40] <devaholic> or something
[16:55:44] <devaholic> advertising with stiqrs
[16:56:15] <jaequery> yeah it's all that real-estate in your site, can now do stuff with it
[16:56:20] <imsky> new business idea: capture the code stiqr adds to my site, strip the ads, use the code
[16:56:41] <devaholic> i bet eventually someone does that ... you know
[16:56:51] <jaequery> ok its all been nice talkin to ya but i gotta go
[16:56:57] <devaholic> advertising is already all over the page... just a matter of time before that is automated
[16:57:06] <devaholic> (probably already is, but maybe not like stiqr)
[16:57:19] <imsky> wat
[16:57:20] <devaholic> same
[16:57:21] <devaholic> ttyl
[16:57:21] <jaequery> im also workin on some open source CMS, which i hope to make it a all-in-one with Stiqr functionality built right into the CMS
[16:57:41] <jaequery> cya guys
[16:57:42] <devaholic> geocities cms 2.0
[16:57:47] <jaequery> lol
[16:57:59] <jaequery> yea geocities 2 coming baby
[16:58:03] <jaequery> heh
[16:58:06] <devaholic> ok ttyl, look out for nodequery
[16:58:15] <imsky> aw man
[16:58:15] <jaequery> ya i will for sure
[16:58:16] <imsky> <div id="stiqr-id-63661" class="stiqr-resizable stiqr-item-container" style="top: 117px; left: 489px; position: absolute; background-color: transparent; width: 500px; height: 35px; z-index: 1;">
[17:06:01] <aitiba> hi
[17:06:06] <sneakyness> HAY
[17:10:44] <aitiba> I get "missing } in XML expression" on line 5 http://pastebin.com/eCXvNhRQ
[17:10:50] <aitiba> what is wrong there?
[17:14:00] <iateadonut> http://www.xuexijiqi.com/buildOut.php - just wondering in a script like this, draggable and droppable
[17:14:11] <iateadonut> go ahead and post the default textarea field.
[17:14:41] <iateadonut> then you see the next page.  when i drop a word into a box, I'd like the word to be aligned with the box as if it was a div within that div
[17:15:10] <iateadonut> and when it gets dropped, i'd also like the list on the right to be reformed in a similar way.
[17:16:30] <cevarief> Hi, Is there any builtin methode or function to convert from {a : 1, b : 2} become a=1&b2? pretty much like serializing form. Or do i have to do manually?
[17:17:10] <cevarief> err, it supossed to be a=1&b=2
[17:20:03] <BinaryKitten> ?$.param @ cevarief
[17:20:04] <bot-t> cevarief, jQuery.param() - Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[17:21:15] <cevarief> @BinaryKitten thx a lot, that's what i want :D
[17:21:20] <diverdude> Such a control where you have 2 listboxes, and can move items from one listbox to the other, what is that called?
[17:21:36] <diverdude> Such a control where you have 2 listboxes, and can move items from one listbox to the other, what is that called?
[17:21:55] <BinaryKitten> diverdude there is no such control that i know of
[17:22:03] <BinaryKitten> but it's not that difficult to make one
[17:22:40] <aitiba>  I get "missing } in XML expression" on line 5 http://pastebin.com/eCXvNhRQ
[17:22:46] <aitiba> what is wrong there?
[17:23:06] <imsky> who knows!
[17:35:22] <imsky> abjorn: u lurkin bro?
[17:36:11] <atrigent> if I were to ask you guys what .appendTo returns, what would you say?
[17:36:12] <abjorn> dood
[17:36:12] <abjorn> kinda
[17:36:14] <abjorn> not really
[17:36:23] <abjorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOIyfRoGcM watchan this
[17:36:34] <atrigent> like if I do: $('<div />').appendTo('div')
[17:36:40] <atrigent> what would that return?
[17:37:42] <jedimind_> it doesnt return anything
[17:37:54] <jedimind_> it appends a div to every div on the page
[17:38:02] <atrigent> um
[17:38:04] <atrigent> no
[17:38:17] <imsky> abjorn: saw dat tweets, is it from the vid?
[17:40:14] <atrigent> anybody?
[17:40:18] <abjorn> yep
[17:40:21] <abjorn> it is
[17:40:30] <imsky> abjorn: he lost that beard!
[17:40:31] <LakWork_> how can i select a root element where one of its children has a particular class?
[17:40:46] <abjorn> imsky: I'm not sure how I feel about it
[17:40:50] <imsky> the beard _is_ crockford
[17:40:55] <abjorn> atrigent: It would return the element you created
[17:41:00] <jedimind_> atrigent, if yuo dont believe me, go read the documentation
[17:41:04] <abjorn> pretty sure
[17:41:07] <abjorn> IM PRETTY SURE
[17:41:10] <abjorn> but idk
[17:41:11] <atrigent> jedimind_: right back atcha
[17:41:12] <abjorn> jedimind_ read the docs
[17:41:39] <abjorn> but just based on how jQuery usually returns chained functions, it should be the created element
[17:41:44] <atrigent> abjorn: and yes, that is what I though as well
[17:41:51] <atrigent> but that is apparently not correct
[17:42:03] <atrigent> it actually returns the elements which were added to the page
[17:42:09] <atrigent> is this documented anywhere? nah
[17:42:26] <abjorn> the elements which were added to the page...which is...the one you created
[17:42:28] <abjorn> so i was right
[17:42:29] <abjorn> :)
[17:42:39] <jedimind_> you mean the one that is within the jquery object?
[17:42:42] <atrigent> no, since it clones them if there are multiple targets
[17:42:48] <jedimind_> as in the same way every jquery object is returned?
[17:42:52] <atrigent> like
[17:42:52] <jedimind_> $()
[17:43:01] <atrigent> the 'div' selector selects multiple divs
[17:43:05] <atrigent> so multiple targets
[17:43:16] <atrigent> and it clones the original element to add it to all of those divs
[17:43:20] <jedimind_> what does $('div') by itself return?
[17:43:20] <abjorn> WELL AREN'T YOU MISTER PERFECT
[17:43:34] <abjorn> I didn't know I was being QUIZZED TODAY
[17:43:45] <jedimind_> A jQuery object contains a collection of Document Object Model (DOM) elements that have been created from an HTML string or selected from a document.
[17:43:54] <atrigent> I was just wondering what people here would expect
[17:43:58] <atrigent> because it wasn't what I expected
[17:44:17] <imsky> abjorn: lololol
[17:45:01] <RedOrigin> I'm totally confused, I'm trying to turn this php array into a jquery object. I used json_encode on the variable of the array, and that's really as far as I've gotten, how do I use the encoded variable in jquery?
[17:45:43] <RedOrigin> Also I looked at the json parser and get from the jquery api.
[17:46:50] <imsky> RedOrigin: you need to send that variable via ajax or something
[17:47:45] <RedOrigin> even though it's in the same domain?
[17:49:02] <imsky> yeeees
[17:49:18] <RedOrigin> okay, thanks.
[17:55:18] <abjorn> dat crock, always hatan on the jshint
[17:55:36] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: what now? I just got here
[17:55:56] <abjorn> was watching a crockford talk
[17:56:03] <abjorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIOIyfRoGcM
[17:56:09] <abjorn> it's not very different from his others
[17:56:10] <abjorn> but im bored
[17:56:13] <abjorn> and feel like watching something
[17:57:18] <ryanneufeld> ugh
[17:57:45] <ryanneufeld> I wish youtube would like, I dunno, not stop playing 1/2 through to cache on a 50MBit line:S
[17:58:04] <abjorn> lolololol
[17:58:06] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: is the audio crackling for you?
[17:58:17] <abjorn> it does at the start
[17:58:18] <abjorn> then stops
[17:58:18] <LakWork_> i have a change event attached to a checkbox and i am setting the checkbox's checked state with a .prop('checked', 'true') in another block of code but it isnt firing the changed event. Is this wrong?
[17:58:30] <ryanneufeld> kk, must be the intro
[17:58:41] <LakWork_> .prop('checked', true) rather
[17:59:04] <ryanneufeld> LakWork_: add a .trigger('change') to that call
[17:59:07] <ryanneufeld> should work
[17:59:09] <LakWork_> thanks!
[17:59:42] <LakWork_> :[ not workin
[18:00:12] <ryanneufeld> sorry, please accept this gift
[18:00:13] <ryanneufeld> https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3H-b7AFnpE4/TqhDiDPG0KI/AAAAAAAAKJU/QIpbMwzYsn4/s400/boss.gif
[18:00:31] <LakWork_> that is the 6th time i've seen that today
[18:00:42] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[18:00:42] <LakWork_> from 4 different people and twice by finding it myself
[18:00:57] <abjorn> lol google+
[18:01:04] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:01:05] <LakWork_> or reddit :]
[18:02:19] <ryanneufeld> I don't reddit
[18:02:21] <ryanneufeld> I used to dig
[18:02:22] <ryanneufeld> and /,
[18:02:40] <ryanneufeld>  /. I mean
[18:03:37] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yt?
[18:03:53] <gnarf> nope
[18:03:54] <gnarf> :)
[18:03:58] <ryanneufeld> LIES
[18:04:42] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: https://gist.github.com/1323944
[18:04:51] <ryanneufeld> added some functionality
[18:05:17] <ryanneufeld> time out, delay before show, and onClose callback
[18:06:46] <LakWork_> the idea here is that when the td element of a table is clicked, it should toggle the checkbox in that td's row: http://jsfiddle.net/TNTWx/
[18:07:08] <LakWork_> likewise, if a checkbox is changed it should add or remove a class from the parent tr
[18:07:21] <LakWork_> if you test it, the changed event only fires if i click on the checkbox
[18:07:46] <ryanneufeld> LakWork_: you didn't do what I said :)
[18:07:52] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/TNTWx/1/
[18:07:53] <LakWork_> i didn't?
[18:07:56] <ryanneufeld> nope
[18:08:04] <ryanneufeld> 'change' !== 'changed'
[18:08:05] <LakWork_> oh
[18:08:06] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: lookin pretty good :)
[18:08:07] <LakWork_> ballsacks
[18:08:08] <LakWork_> thanks!
[18:08:11] <ryanneufeld> np
[18:08:16] <ryanneufeld> thanks gnarf
[18:08:32] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: do you think there is a better way to do the settimeout and setinterval?
[18:08:42] <ryanneufeld> seems a little crowded
[18:08:54] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: pull the logic that does it into other functions
[18:09:04] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that was what I was thinking
[18:09:05] <gnarf> it will be more maintainable anyway
[18:09:25] <gnarf> the timeOut is a little wierd
[18:10:28] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yeah, i wrote that in about 10mins this morning :P
[18:10:37] <gnarf> i don't like the interval with a -- countdown
[18:10:51] <ryanneufeld> oh?
[18:11:12] <gnarf> i don't like intervals in the first place
[18:11:32] <gnarf> ?setInterval
[18:11:32] <bot-t> http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[18:11:40] <ryanneufeld> ah, is there another way?
[18:11:54] <gnarf> there is always another way :)
[18:12:02] <ryanneufeld> of course there is...
[18:12:03] <ryanneufeld> lol
[18:14:01] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: lemme just code up this approach I'm thinking about
[18:14:08] <ryanneufeld> giver
[18:19:24] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: actually this is just not working out well so whatever
[18:19:42] <ryanneufeld> it's the refs to the notifiy object isn't it?
[18:19:57] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: not really, its this # counting down
[18:20:14] <gnarf> i just don't like it
[18:20:22] <z1000> so cycle plugin is taking a big poop on me...curious if anyone has any insight... http://mggpl.com/new/practices/corporate/ click the arrows toward top right of page... for some reason its butchering the slider's padding
[18:20:25] <ryanneufeld> it's for user feedback
[18:20:31] <gnarf> but coding around it is more effort to support somethinng that isn't a big deal...
[18:21:02] <gnarf> ooo wait
[18:21:05] <gnarf> i think i got it
[18:21:07] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: what you're saying is that it's more effort than it's worth?
[18:21:09] <ryanneufeld> or not
[18:21:16] <z1000> anyone take a quick peak?
[18:22:07] <ryanneufeld> the padding only vanishes when it's sliding?
[18:22:22] <ryanneufeld> perhaps you need a sub container with a static width
[18:22:43] <z1000> yea only when sliding and/or click
[18:23:22] <z1000> ryanneufeld, I was trying to avoid that... so frustrating why does it go poopie :(
[18:23:42] <ryanneufeld> z1000: without seeing the code, I dunno
[18:23:54] <z1000> well its more of a cycle thing than my code
[18:24:00] <ryanneufeld> also, adding a child div to wrap your content isn't a big deal
[18:24:06] <ryanneufeld> that's what I mean, i don't know that plugin
[18:24:12] <z1000> ya.. :(

[18:24:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld:
[18:27:44] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I see whut you did tahr
[18:27:58] <ryanneufeld> That was gonna be my next step
[18:32:29] <fructose> It seems like my input field is changing from input.textfield to input.highlighttextfield just because I do .css('background-color', 'pink'). Is that... normal?
[18:34:24] <ryanneufeld> fructose: no, thats very strange, it should only do that when you set the background color to green
[18:35:04] <ryanneufeld> fructose: What I meant to say was: Your question doesn't give any information to help anyone help you.
[18:37:08] <fructose> ryanneufeld: And your response doesn't give me any idea what more information I need to provide
[18:37:38] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ fructose
[18:37:39] <bot-t> fructose, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:40:48] <fructose> Code isn't suitable for pasting, sorry
[18:41:36] <ryanneufeld> fructose: k, well, it's gonna be hard to help without it
[18:42:07] <ryanneufeld> fructose: but if you have some kinda form validation plugin, that might be doing it, jquery on it's own won't make that change
[18:42:23] <ryanneufeld> I'm assuming your seeing a change in class on the input when you set the background color on it?
[18:42:46] <ryanneufeld> beyond that, without seeing your code. I can't help you. Someone else might be able to.
[18:43:28] <fructose> Well, my question was if it was normal. It sounds like it's not.
[18:44:02] <ryanneufeld> and without seeing the code, knowing what plugins you have, it's impossible to say
[18:45:20] <fructose> I guess you would say the same thing about it being normal if your page reloads when you do $('#foo').text(12);
[18:45:38] <fructose> Whereas personally I would say that's not normal
[18:46:55] <ryanneufeld> well, if you have a plugin that replaces the text() with one that changes the location.href
[18:47:17] <ryanneufeld> I would say that is normal, however, with only stock jquery loaded, I think that's not normal
[18:47:44] <ryanneufeld> but, I can't see your code, so even with stock jquery, you could have some strange code, that does some strange thing
[18:48:06] <ryanneufeld> but I think you got your answer
[18:54:35] <fructose> Yes, thanks
[18:56:48] <fructose> Is there a way to make this into one selector... jQuery('input.textfield,input.highlighttextfield').filter(':not(#signature)')
[18:57:27] <fructose> Without doing the :not() part twice
[18:59:09] <ryanneufeld> just do input
[18:59:20] <ryanneufeld> input[type=text]
[19:01:14] <ryanneufeld> fructose: again, without seeing any html, or js, that's the best I can offer
[19:02:42] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: do you think using deferreds would be better for this timeOut sitch?
[19:17:23] <godmachine-x6> im looking for something to disable only scrolling on spacebar key press, but not disable spacebar from text fields.. does anyone have a suggestion?
[19:22:12] <ryanneufeld> godmachine-x6: yeah don't
[19:22:28] <ryanneufeld> why do you need to disable it?
[19:22:46] <godmachine-x6> ryanneufeld:: what i am wanting to do is stop space bar scrolling but keep the space bar working in text fields
[19:23:08] <godmachine-x6> it is an annoyance in a web browser when you are trying to type in a flash plugin or some container and it keeps scrolling the page on you
[19:23:09] <ryanneufeld> godmachine-x6: yeah, i got that from your last message, but WHY?
[19:23:30] <ryanneufeld> godmachine-x6: sounds like something else is wrong if that's what's happening
[19:23:38] <ryanneufeld> I have NEVER had that happen to me, ever.
[19:23:44] <godmachine-x6> use chrome then
[19:23:50] <ryanneufeld> I do, all day
[19:23:55] <ryanneufeld> every day
[19:23:59] <ryanneufeld> I'm using it now :P
[19:24:03] <godmachine-x6> go on g+ and join a zynga poker match
[19:24:09] <godmachine-x6> type something with a space in the chat box
[19:24:15] <godmachine-x6> see if it doesn't scroll down on you
[19:24:20] <ryanneufeld> oh, you said zynga
[19:24:30] <ryanneufeld> I stopped giving shit. Sorry
[19:24:32] <godmachine-x6> it doesn't matter, it happens on anything that uses flash
[19:24:49] <godmachine-x6> that was a plain example..
[19:24:50] <ryanneufeld> sounds like you should report a chrome bug
[19:24:58] <godmachine-x6> meh..
[19:25:16] <godmachine-x6> i want to try to get a extension working to do it
[19:25:27] <godmachine-x6> filing bugs with google is pointless. besides there are already bugs open with the matter
[19:25:27] <ryanneufeld> or, report a bug, so you don't need it
[19:25:39] <ryanneufeld> what version are you using?
[19:25:55] <godmachine-x6> 17.x, 16.x, 15.x  they all do it
[19:26:23] <godmachine-x6> so does anyone else have any suggestions to disable scrollbar in all areas except text fields
[19:26:33] <godmachine-x6> i dont care nothing for hearing someone give me a run around about do this do that instead
[19:26:39] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: maybe with the progressing stuff from 1.7 but not in 1.6
[19:27:08] <godmachine-x6> meh.. not scrollbar, spacebar*
[19:28:55] <ryanneufeld> godmachine-x6: I just tried to type a space in the zynga thing
[19:28:59] <ryanneufeld> and it works fine
[19:29:09] <ryanneufeld> perhaps an update to flash?
[19:30:08] <godmachine-x6> well i have to say i dont believe you
[19:30:18] <godmachine-x6> anyway i didn't come here to get trolled and told to do this and that
[19:30:25] <godmachine-x6> i wanted jquery /js help
[19:30:26] <ryanneufeld> I'm not trolling you dude
[19:30:31] <godmachine-x6> not info on how to file a damn bug
[19:30:37] <godmachine-x6> or update a plugin
[19:30:54] <ryanneufeld> dude, you're clearly frustrated, and I AM trying to help
[19:31:10] <godmachine-x6> yea well thanks for trying, but i rather have help with the original question
[19:31:12] <ryanneufeld> my point was merely that perhaps you have a larger issue than you realze
[19:31:14] <godmachine-x6> not help with alternatives
[19:31:31] <godmachine-x6> i doubt i do.. just google for chrome spacebar scroll
[19:31:44] <godmachine-x6> you will see that its not me.. and other browsers are also affected
[19:32:14] <godmachine-x6> im looking for a js code that would disable spacebar scrolling period.. whether chrome wants to fix it or not
[19:32:21] <godmachine-x6> whether flash is the issue or not
[19:32:29] <godmachine-x6> k?
[19:32:52] <ryanneufeld> godmachine-x6: see, if it's happening in flash
[19:32:57] <ryanneufeld> then jquery can't help you
[19:33:04] <ryanneufeld> cause flash takes the keybaord/mouse focus
[19:33:07] <godmachine-x6> blah
[19:33:08] <ryanneufeld> I run into that all the time
[19:33:13] <godmachine-x6> hit spacebar on any page
[19:33:17] <godmachine-x6> and tell me it doesn't scroll down
[19:33:20] <ryanneufeld> it does
[19:33:24] <ryanneufeld> but I'm telling you
[19:33:31] <ryanneufeld> if you're having a problem with flash
[19:33:32] <godmachine-x6> well im telling you i dont want that feature at all
[19:33:38] <godmachine-x6> not just in flash
[19:33:41] <godmachine-x6> on http://*
[19:33:43] <ryanneufeld> I got that
[19:33:52] <ryanneufeld> you need to bind to the keydown event
[19:34:06] <godmachine-x6> well i know that much
[19:34:27] <godmachine-x6> but how to only disable scrolling and not disable spacebar while in a text field?
[19:35:22] <ryanneufeld> you'd pretty much have to bind to the entire document, and then whenever the spacebar is hit, figure out where the focus is
[19:35:46] <ryanneufeld> and decide if you want to insert the space or not
[19:35:55] * gnarf shrugs
[19:36:46] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yeah I got your message, you don't think it would be worth it?
[19:37:23] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: if you had 1.7 for progress events, it might be
[19:37:31] <snover> godmachine-x6: do not be user hostile.
[19:37:32] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[19:38:12] <godmachine-x6> im not being user hostile.. i just got the a bad impression in here when i was told "i stopped giving a shit"
[19:38:21] <godmachine-x6> with that attitude i dont think i will be too kind back..
[19:38:26] <snover> godmachine-x6: disabling spacebar scrolling is user hostile.
[19:39:02] <ryanneufeld> modification of any browser behaviour is really
[19:39:05] <godmachine-x6> i have never scrolled with spacebar.. don't know many people who do.. i have up and down arrows, and a mouse wheel
[19:39:23] <ryanneufeld> I don't know anyone who owns a 7 carrat diamond
[19:39:29] <godmachine-x6> well thanks for the help.. i think i solved the issue
[19:39:31] <ryanneufeld> so there for no one must own any
[19:39:43] <ryanneufeld> oh wait, I just saw a rich woman on tv with one
[19:40:18] <snover> ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never done it so nobody ever does it‚Äù‚Äîobviously this is why features exist, right? because nobody uses them?
[19:40:19] <snover> :)
[19:40:28] <ryanneufeld> yeah, he's gone
[19:40:29] <ryanneufeld> lol
[19:40:31] <snover> I know that
[19:40:59] * gnarf cheers
[19:41:43] <ryanneufeld> well, I sure hope no one makes a plugin that does that
[19:41:56] <ryanneufeld> but I suppose I don't have to install it
[19:47:45] <CrimsonHelix> wow
[19:47:52] <CrimsonHelix> this is a lot of people in a jQuery room
[19:49:28] <ryanneufeld> don't mind the smell, sometimes awesome is sweaty
[19:52:40] <CrimsonHelix> lol
[19:52:49] <CrimsonHelix> so do people try and speak in code here much?
[19:54:08] <CrimsonHelix> if ($('brain :wondering').find('.speaking.code'))
[19:55:45] <ryanneufeld> NO
[19:55:49] <ryanneufeld> *no
[19:55:55] <ryanneufeld> people don't really do that
[19:56:04] <ryanneufeld> we just talk, and ask questions.
[20:08:47] <iateadonut> in the jquery droppable ui, how do you refer to the object that was dropped in the callback function?
[20:08:58] <iateadonut> $( this ) being the thing it was dropped onto
[20:13:06] <devslash> I've got a web site powered by jquery that works in iOS,IE,google chrome,Firefox and safari but doesn't work in android. is there a way to actively debug my web site in android to see why it isn't working
[20:13:36] <ryanneufeld> iateadonut: you should be getting event and ui
[20:13:51] <ryanneufeld> iateadonut: check out ui.item
[20:14:26] <ryanneufeld> iateadonut: I found that in some cases, it's not really easy to get exactly the one you want, you might need to guess at it by checking for classes, and removing them once successful
[20:14:49] <ryanneufeld> devslash: wienre
[20:14:55] <devslash> huh ?
[20:15:17] <ryanneufeld> devslash: http://phonegap.github.com/weinre/
[20:15:53] <ryanneufeld> devslash: yes, it is possible to do what you are asking.
[20:16:14] <devslash> it says source level debug of javascript is not possible
[20:16:24] <ryanneufeld> okay
[20:16:30] <ryanneufeld> Then no
[20:16:38] <ryanneufeld> but you can make due with console.log
[20:16:47] <ryanneufeld> and inspection of the html to see what's going on
[20:16:51] <ryanneufeld> it's better than nothing
[20:16:53] <iateadonut> thanks.
[20:16:55] <devslash> i guess
[20:17:03] <iateadonut> how can i dump an object out into a alert?
[20:17:16] <ryanneufeld> iateadonut: alert? why?
[20:17:30] <iateadonut> so i can see what ui is.
[20:17:31] <ryanneufeld> ?console.log @iateadonut
[20:17:32] <bot-t> iateadonut, console.log | jQuery Plugins - Full featured jQuery Debugger with console.log or alert() capabilities with overrideable variables and methods http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/consolelog
[20:17:41] <ryanneufeld> ?console @iateadonut
[20:17:42] <bot-t> iateadonut, Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[20:18:01] <ryanneufeld> iateadonut: you can also use the chrome javascript console
[20:18:15] <ryanneufeld> CMD+SHIFT+J on mac
[20:18:19] <ryanneufeld> not sure what it is on PC
[20:18:31] <RedOrigin> I've got a php array that I'd like to convert to a jquery array, but I'm not sure how to do it.
[20:18:36] <iateadonut> i have firebug - i'll check it out.
[20:18:46] <ryanneufeld> RedOrigin: json_encode
[20:19:08] <ryanneufeld> iateadonut: yeah, learn to love the console. I used to write my plugins in firebug :p
[20:20:06] <RedOrigin> I have already set the array to a variable and used json_encode on it, but the part where you use .getJSON is really killing me. Could I ask for a bit more help?
[20:20:34] <devslash> ryanneufeld: how do i attach weinre to androids browser
[20:21:00] <ryanneufeld> devslash: you have to include a JS file that is included from your weinre instance
[20:21:06] <ryanneufeld> then you open a browser to it
[20:21:10] <ryanneufeld> it's all in the docs
[20:21:20] <ryanneufeld> RedOrigin: when you do getJSON it becomes an object
[20:21:27] <ryanneufeld> RedOrigin: so you have to treat it as such
[20:24:16] <RedOrigin> I think that helped me a bit. At least enough to give me an idea of how to wrap my head around it. Thanks ryanneufeld.
[20:24:25] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/ntf9C/
[20:24:29] <ryanneufeld> look at that too
[20:24:53] <ryanneufeld> that's the basic way to see hat's coming back
[20:25:06] <ryanneufeld> and if you console.log(theObjectThing)
[20:25:25] <ryanneufeld> chrome, or firebug will show you in the JS console the structure of the object
[20:25:42] <ryanneufeld> What I typically do if I have an array of items is return an array of objects
[20:26:01] <Whirl3d> Is it possible to determine the width and height of an empty div that has explicitly declared height and width (in css)
[20:26:16] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d u trollin?
[20:26:37] <Whirl3d> In other words, if I have a background image that I am using as a sprite...I don't need anything in the div
[20:26:50] <Whirl3d> but I can't seem to get the height and width programmatically.
[20:27:02] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: that could depend on how you have it positioned
[20:27:22] <ryanneufeld> try adding a red border to it in your css
[20:27:33] <ryanneufeld> see if it shows up the size you're expecting it to
[20:27:44] <Whirl3d> I have tried literally every combination of positions, display settings. Right now I have a blue dotted border and can see them, no problems
[20:27:44] <ryanneufeld> if it doesn't check the position of the parent element
[20:27:52] <ryanneufeld> ?p
[20:27:53] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:28:05] <RedOrigin> ryanneufeld: thanks again, I'll go study up.
[20:28:21] <ryanneufeld> RedOrigin: Np, come back when you have more Q's
[20:28:27] <Whirl3d> I'll post the page. It's probably complicated, but I appreciate your help.
[20:28:56] <ryanneufeld> I'll try, no promises, I'm not a css expert
[20:31:46] <ryanneufeld> great, now I have a question :)
[20:32:06] <ryanneufeld> how does it work that you can call dfd.resolve without the parens an yet it works?
[20:32:07] <Whirl3d> hit it, I'll try to help back.
[20:32:23] <Whirl3d> Oh shit, that's above my head, lol.
[20:32:45] <Whirl3d> is it a property?
[20:32:53] <ryanneufeld> not sure
[20:33:10] <Whirl3d> like in some languages, you set getters/setters and access them (without parens)
[20:33:40] <Whirl3d> check to see if there is an equivalent get and set method for resolve
[20:34:04] <ryanneufeld> apparently it's a function
[20:34:15] <ryanneufeld> curious
[20:35:09] * ryanneufeld is using the source
[20:37:03] <ryanneufeld> oh, k, reading the example again
[20:37:06] <ryanneufeld> I see I was mistaken
[20:37:22] <ryanneufeld> the "calling" of it was actually something else
[20:37:24] <ryanneufeld> derp
[20:37:31] <ryanneufeld> you need the parens to call it
[20:38:08] <ryanneufeld> ?deferred @ Whirl3d
[20:38:09] <bot-t> Whirl3d, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[20:38:14] <ryanneufeld> that's what I was reading FYI
[20:38:18] <ryanneufeld> or not
[20:38:24] <ryanneufeld> ?Deferreds
[20:38:25] <bot-t> Read this for getting started with deferreds: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[20:38:28] <ryanneufeld> that one
[20:39:59] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I read that article when 1.6 came out and though it sounded great, I'm not quite ready to apply any of it yet. one day, though...
[20:41:36] <Samian> Hey
[20:41:50] <Samian> I remember there was a girl on here. Anyway I need an opinion on what hairstyle looks better
[20:42:05] <ryanneufeld> Samian: that's sexist
[20:42:09] <ryanneufeld> and I don't much like it
[20:42:34] <Samian> I remember coming here a hear ago and there was this girl jquery expert
[20:42:35] <ryanneufeld> I'm sure there are several under-qualified people here that could help you
[20:42:38] <Samian> she was a professional
[20:42:46] <Samian> did jquery seminars and everything
[20:42:48] <ryanneufeld> Samian: I'm just teasing
[20:43:01] <ryanneufeld> and you're thinking of Rebecca Murphey, I'm guessing
[20:43:04] <ryanneufeld> rmurphey on here
[20:43:06] <Samian> yeah that's it
[20:43:09] <Samian> yep
[20:43:21] <ryanneufeld> not sure if she participates or just lurks now, I never see her post
[20:43:32] <Samian> rmurphey
[20:43:34] <Samian> yo yo wait up
[20:43:37] <Samian> wake up
[20:44:04] <ryanneufeld> good luck with that
[20:44:11] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: I'll be AFK for about 20min
[20:44:16] <ryanneufeld> but I'll be back
[20:45:25] <Whirl3d> thx.
[20:52:06] <iateadonut> how do you refer to the child element of  $( this )?
[20:52:25] <iateadonut> a child ul in this case.
[20:52:40] <Whirl3d> $(this).children("ul");
[20:53:05] <Whirl3d> or $(this).find("ul")--but that goes deeper than just the first level
[20:58:32] <ngharo> mmmm yeaa deeper
[21:01:21] <abjorn> we need to go deeper, ngharo
[21:03:58] <ngharo> DONT STOP
[21:04:51] <ngharo> you dont clearInterval til i tell you to young man
[21:24:08] <iateadonut> if anyone is paying attention, how many children div's does $('div#something') have?
[21:25:53] <ngharo> you tell me bro
[21:27:35] <iateadonut> and also, how can you append a div with class droppable?
[21:29:12] <ngharo> $('<div />', {class: 'droppable'}).appendTo('#something')
[21:29:35] <ngharo> $('<div />').addClass('droppable').appendTo('#something')
[21:55:21] <someprimetime> how can i set this variable without it activating? var $remove = $("#" + $currentId + "-list li").remove();
[21:55:22] <someprimetime> cau
[22:01:59] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: did you get help?
[22:02:09] <ryanneufeld> sorry I was gone longer than expected
[22:11:48] <Whirl3d> np, I just finished up a complete rewrite of my script. It's much easier to read now.
[22:12:23] <Whirl3d> I think I am going to have scope problems galore...we'll see.
[22:15:23] <qjack> Hi, I was wondering why there is no such thing (or I can't find it) like addAttr(), because removeAttr() does exist. I am actually using the REL attribute in my website but want to remove/add it with JQuery code ... the removing is fine of course, but I need to find a way to add one
[22:16:36] <scar2> ive got a simple dialog jquery plugin being used, and i tried to set the dialog div to position:fixed; and it jacked it all up. i want the dialog to stay fixed position. the modal option is set to true, and it disables everything, but if i scroll with my mouse the dialog will scroll away
[22:16:52] <devslash> hey guys. I'm testing out my jquery based site to make sure it works on as many different browsers as possible. if you want to help me can you please pm me what browser and platform you use and ill give you the link if i haven't tested out my site on that browser/platform already
[22:20:02] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: well, the rewrite should help with that
[22:20:18] <ryanneufeld> ?attr() @qjack
[22:20:19] <bot-t> qjack, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[22:21:04] <scar2> how can i set a fixed position on a jquery dialog?
[22:21:04] <ryanneufeld> scar2: "jacked it all up" isn't clear what you mean
[22:21:07] <scar2> well
[22:21:15] <scar2> like the CSS goes away or something
[22:21:20] <scar2> nothing about it is right haha
[22:21:41] <ryanneufeld> devslash: chrome 16/osx, ff latest/osx lion
[22:22:06] <ryanneufeld> scar2: your setting position fixed and this happens?
[22:22:09] <devslash> oh ok thanks but i use a mac so I've tested both of those browsers
[22:22:14] <devslash> 16 ?
[22:22:17] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[22:22:19] <devslash> i thought chrome was at version 10
[22:22:33] <ryanneufeld> devslash: uhmm
[22:22:34] <ryanneufeld> no
[22:22:37] <qjack> bot-t: I am not looking to get the value of an attribute, I am looking to place a new attribute, the opposite of what removeAttr() does
[22:22:38] <ryanneufeld> it's at like 10
[22:22:38] <bot-t> qjack, .css() - Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[22:22:51] <ryanneufeld> qjack: bot-t is a bot
[22:23:00] <ryanneufeld> qjack: I told it to tell you that lol
[22:23:11] <ryanneufeld> qjack: the attr is what you want to add the attribute
[22:23:17] <ryanneufeld> qjack: read, don't assume
[22:23:24] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, I am setting a cookie value like this "$.cookie('the_cookie', num, { expires: 7, path: '/' });" , now what to do if I need to clear cookie value on browser close?
[22:23:42] <ryanneufeld> Paveloosha: set an expiry in the past
[22:23:55] <ryanneufeld> Paveloosha: don't set an expire I think does that
[22:23:59] <devslash> so is it at 10 or 16
[22:24:00] <scar2> ryanneufeld: click here http://www.absoluteplacementtoday.com/ -- the red square/rectangle on right side top fold ish
[22:24:09] <scar2> i just added position:fixed to ti
[22:24:22] <ryanneufeld> scar2: yeah
[22:24:26] <ryanneufeld> that's a css issue
[22:24:39] <Paveloosha> <ryanneufeld>, removing "expires: 7" not working.. it is not setting the cookie..
[22:24:44] <ryanneufeld> it's probably due to some floats being fucked up
[22:25:06] <qjack> ryanneufeld: you're right, I should have read the full page. I just stopped reading after I saw the attr() short description: "Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements." ... it's a bit misleading imo
[22:25:29] <scar2> ryanneufeld: ahh fixed the wrong class :)
[22:25:36] <ryanneufeld> :)
[22:25:52] <ryanneufeld> nice work
[22:26:06] <qjack> Thanks for pointing it out anyway, saved me some reworking time
[22:26:22] <ryanneufeld> qjack: yeah no worries
[22:28:32] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I cleaned up my code using a deferred like you suggested. Much better now
[22:28:35] <scar2> ryanneufeld: when i set the show: 'clip' inside my $( "#dialog" ).dialog({ autoOpen: false, modal: true, draggable: false, resizable: false, show: 'clip', width:500, height:580 });
[22:28:47] <scar2> how do i set the speed on it or other show settings for that effect?
[22:28:54] <ryanneufeld> scar2: no idea dude
[22:29:10] <scar2> b/c i saw the show can be called as a function
[22:29:13] <ryanneufeld> I just looked at your demo and I've seen that kinda css issue before
[22:29:18] <scar2> but inside the actual handler
[22:29:25] <scar2> well, i fixed the css issue. i found the class.
[22:29:25] <ryanneufeld> you'd have to check the jqueryui docs
[22:29:38] <scar2>  u can refresh
[22:29:42] <scar2> yeah
[22:34:31] <Whirl3d> I notice with 1.6, I get less errors in my code and always something wrong in the jquery code. LOL or so Chrome would have me believe. I liked it better when jquery code never threw an error, it was always referred back to my code..
[22:35:19] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: likely if you get an error in jquery, you wanna follow the trace in the chrome console
[22:35:25] <ryanneufeld> and see where in your code it was called
[22:35:30] <Whirl3d> It's hard to troubleshoot the error jsquery.min uncaught typerror, property defaultView of undefined? huh?
[22:36:15] <ryanneufeld> in chrome
[22:36:27] <ryanneufeld> click the little black arrow beside the error
[22:36:35] <ryanneufeld> should expand it to a stack trace
[22:36:42] <ryanneufeld> then you can follow it back
[22:36:53] <ryanneufeld> or if you have your code in a fiddle
[22:36:56] <Whirl3d> Yeah. And usually, the error thrown has a triangle you can drop down to trace...but on occasion, there's no line in my code, just the jquery code
[22:37:06] <ryanneufeld> interesting
[22:37:11] <Whirl3d> doesn't always work, that's what I am saying
[22:37:15] <ryanneufeld> I use unminified jquery to dev against
[22:38:18] <Whirl3d> ?.load
[22:38:18] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[22:38:30] <ryanneufeld> ?boom
[22:38:30] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[22:42:25] <Whirl3d> here's my mess: http://whirl3d.com/projects/bookanimator/pageTest.html
[22:42:52] <ryanneufeld> k
[22:42:55] <ryanneufeld> what's it do?
[22:43:22] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: include non-minified js
[22:43:27] <ryanneufeld> for testing
[22:44:30] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: did you write pageAnimator3.js?
[22:44:31] <Whirl3d> before I started trying to implement sprites, it loaded the characters, positioned their internal ('self') class off stage (nearest side) and once all loaded, fade them in while sliding them into place
[22:44:36] <Whirl3d> yes
[22:44:43] <ryanneufeld> k, LAY OFF VAR
[22:44:48] <ryanneufeld> you only need ONE
[22:44:51] <Whirl3d> I know
[22:44:56] <ryanneufeld> lol
[22:44:58] <Whirl3d> It's such a force of habit.
[22:45:08] <snover> var ryan; var hello; var how; var are; var you = '?';
[22:45:21] <Whirl3d> Keep in mind this is rough, I just rewrote it from scratch about an hour or two ago
[22:45:22] <ryanneufeld> snover: <3 you too
[22:46:11] <scar2> is there a simple easy way to have something slide out of view and have another div slide in place? i know i can get a slider, but im just wondering if theres an easy way thru a plugin ors omething
[22:46:18] <scar2> similar to how a dialog is very basic jquery
[22:46:21] <Whirl3d> I thinnk I'm gonna just go back to the bulky layered image-faux animation method.
[22:46:39] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: what are you trying to accomplish?
[22:47:14] <devslash> has anyone here used player ?
[22:47:17] <devslash> jplayer
[22:47:31] <Whirl3d> roughly this. this was my first draft: http://whirl3d.com/projects/bookanimator/book.html
[22:48:30] <Whirl3d> simple enough with images, but sprites, I'm having a terrible time
[22:51:09] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/TBMhA/
[22:51:17] <ryanneufeld> might find it easier to play with there
[22:53:44] <Whirl3d> I have a webserver on my home network and I do my development in NuSphere and (don't yell at me) Dreamweaver, so it's pretty easy to play with.
[22:53:59] <ryanneufeld> fair enough
[22:54:02] <wookiehangover> dreamweaver lol
[22:54:06] <wookiehangover> ppl still use that?
[22:54:12] <ryanneufeld> if you like making your job harder
[22:54:20] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/TBMhA/2/
[22:54:29] <ryanneufeld> looks like you're building image names
[22:54:34] <ryanneufeld> which is not so good
[22:54:59] <Whirl3d> buidling image names?
[22:55:31] <ryanneufeld> I know you built this quicly
[22:55:34] <ryanneufeld> *quickly
[22:55:48] <ryanneufeld> but it's not maintainable
[22:55:52] <Whirl3d> I wasn't able to get the size of the div's that have background images to report accurately (at all). So I tried to preload the images, record their dimensions and store them in the characters' data object
[22:56:24] <ryanneufeld> That seems odd
[22:57:20] <Whirl3d> I've been asking for help with it for two days now and nobodoy has responded until you came along (cue harp music)
[22:57:48] <Whirl3d> I think I am going to find another way to make the bastards blink
[22:58:04] <Whirl3d> All this extra baggage to make these goofy character's blink.
[22:58:05] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[22:58:07] <Whirl3d> bah!
[22:59:43] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: .outerWidth()
[22:59:53] <ryanneufeld> reports the width you have set in the css
[23:01:19] <Whirl3d> how would you setup a simple "blinking" eye animation that has 3 states?
[23:01:45] <Whirl3d> I assigned them to classes and added them to the div with a background image offset
[23:01:55] <ryanneufeld> have you looked into the animate() ?
[23:02:01] <Whirl3d> LOL
[23:02:04] <ryanneufeld> there are queues and such you can use
[23:02:06] <ryanneufeld> I dunno man
[23:02:14] <ryanneufeld> I'm kinda lost here too
[23:03:02] <Whirl3d> I'm going back to the old way. Shouldn't take long and you can see what I was trying to accomplish. And I'll lay off the var
[23:04:44] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I gotta run though.
[23:04:54] <ryanneufeld> but .width is returning the correct width
[23:05:00] <Whirl3d> thanks for the help, though.
[23:05:02] <ryanneufeld> chances are your css isn't doing what you think it is
[23:05:15] <ryanneufeld> from what I can see. I'm not a CSS expert thogh
[23:05:19] <Whirl3d> i hate css, so I am sure that's part of it.
[23:05:59] <ryanneufeld> you set the same width on each one to 180
[23:06:06] <ryanneufeld> so they are all the same
[23:06:25] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/TBMhA/4/
[23:06:27] <ryanneufeld> any how
[23:06:29] <ryanneufeld> I gotta run
[23:07:30] <ryanneufeld> I leave you with this http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ehvFZ0QDlAA
[23:07:41] <ryanneufeld> A bunneh eating an apple segment
[23:10:24] <Whirl3d> that bunneh had eaten a joint the size of it's head just 30 minutes before eating that apple. Look at it's eyes...
[23:10:31] <Axsuul> is... jQuery(function() {  .... })  considered to be onDomReady or onLoad
[23:10:49] <ryanneufeld> Axsuul: on domready
[23:10:59] <Axsuul> good thanks
[23:11:01] <ryanneufeld> ?$.ready ? @Axsuul
[23:11:02] <bot-t> Axsuul, .ready() - Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:24:12] <amh345> what's the best method to use to slide a div from point a to point b?  .animate?
[23:34:35] <graphikz> hey, is there anyway I can make http://pastie.org/2776981 more efficient?
[23:43:45] <Axsuul> is there any way to store javascript objects in a DOM element?
[23:44:53] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: Look at .data
[23:45:03] <Eviltwin> ?.data @ Axsuul
[23:45:04] <bot-t> Axsuul, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[23:47:06] <Axsuul> thanks
[23:49:29] <jrockjiggz> graphikz: http://pastie.org/2777004
[23:51:48] <jrockjiggz> its pretty messy code to begin with..
[23:52:25] <graphikz> yup I know lol
[23:52:26] <graphikz> ty
[23:56:31] <devslash> is anyone here
[23:57:39] <devslash> i use jplayer to play media on my site. it has 2 divs defined like this: <div class='jp-volume-bar' id='jp-volume-bar'><div class='jp-volume-bar-value'></div></div>
[23:58:03] <devslash> i want to adjust the height of the volume bar. which div do i supply the class to my css code to ?
