[00:01:20] <SharkUW> your example is flawed
[00:01:37] <bakkot> How so?
[00:02:05] <SharkUW> you're comparing a closure to a regular function call
[00:04:28] <snover> ?optimization @ bakkot
[00:04:28] <bot-t> bakkot, The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[00:05:40] <bakkot> SharkUW, why would that matter for simple arithmetic operations?
[00:06:21] <SharkUW> variable scoping. Does it change if you declare i and j local?
[00:06:53] <snover> the fact of the matter is that you should never ever be using dom 0 event handlers
[00:06:56] <bakkot> nope.
[00:07:10] <bakkot> snover, of course this is true, but it's still a bug, I think.
[00:08:55] <SharkUW> I just checked and making i and j local scope dropped it to 20% time
[00:09:21] <SharkUW> that's an 80% improvement...not a bug there either
[00:12:58] <bakkot> It's still a good 5x slower. Is that really just scoping issues?
[00:14:43] <SharkUW> yes, most of it is scoping. Overlooking it is probably one of the largest things people do to slow down their code
[00:15:11] <SharkUW> that said, I'm still of the mind that all modern engines are fast enough and if general code isn't running well then it's best to not do it in JS anyways.
[00:21:24] <bakkot> Yeah, this wouldn't have been an issue with production code, I just thought it was odd. I still think it's odd that it's 5x slower even when everything is local. Didn't realize scope would matter so much here.
[00:21:25] <SharkUW> anyways though, the rest can be chalked up to the inability to optimize what amounts to an eval executed on click
[00:21:46] <SharkUW> oh yeah, hitting up the variable chain that many times is brutal. hehe
[00:22:09] <SharkUW> lots o' optimization tricks occur on load
[00:23:52] <bakkot> Yeah, thanks for your help.
[00:24:45] <SharkUW> no problem. I'm just hanging out all bored.
[00:54:20] <ace_me> how can I style a background of a calendar cell ?
[00:57:27] <ace_me> I want to see a cell fully coloured with that colours http://jsfiddle.net/ryleyb/b6V3W/1/  any hint please ?
[01:01:57] <peol> ace_me: .workingday .ui-state-default { css }
[01:02:02] <peol> ace_me: shouldn't need !important
[01:10:13] <ace_me> not working peol http://jsfiddle.net/b6V3W/81/
[01:10:38] <SharkUW> what are you trying to do?
[01:11:17] <ace_me> I want to style the cell in the calendar SharkUW
[01:11:29] <ace_me> and not only the "below" background
[01:13:22] <SharkUW> I'm not sure exactly what you're aiming for. They seem to have styles?
[01:14:27] <ace_me> yes but they are not coloured fully
[01:14:40] <ace_me> you see a border colour when run it
[01:14:41] <SharkUW> oh, so what's showing as a border you want as the full bg?
[01:14:47] <ace_me> yes SharkUW
[01:15:04] <peol> ace_me: http://jsfiddle.net/b6V3W/82/ play around with this, http://jsfiddle.net/b6V3W/82/
[01:23:46] <SharkUW> oh, you just need to target the anchor and force no background image
[01:24:12] <SharkUW> hmm, that kills off its whit ehighlight though
[01:25:51] <codecowboy> hi. I've got some code which shows a tooltip on hover. Problem is that if the mouse ends up inside the tooltip when it displays, the tooltip flashes on and off - is in some sort of continuous event loop. Can anyone explain why? https://gist.github.com/1190852
[01:32:40] <SharkUW> best way I can think of to do tooltips is don't have a regular mouseout event. On mouseover show the tt and keep a record of the position/dimension of the item 'tipped' and remove the tt by polling mouse move
[01:44:05] <codecowboy> SharkUW:  thanks. I made a jsfiddle to try and illustrate the problem but it doesn't happen so I guess there is something else going on. Can I watch events firing in firebug to try and figure out what is going on?
[01:56:01] <codecowboy> SharkUW:  I narrowed it down - it only happens in Firefox for me. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7292132/why-do-my-tooltips-flash-in-firefox-and-not-chrome
[02:01:16] <joelcox> How would I handle a "NetworkError: 404 Not Found" for a JSONP request?
[02:03:45] <joelcox> nevermind
[02:28:15] <phidah> How come $('<select name="id"></select>').find('select') doesn't return anything?
[03:19:47] <styol> phidah: try $('select[name="id"]')
[03:28:47] <TrueColors> $("div.modal_popup, div.modal_overlay").fadeOut(400).delay(400).remove();
[03:28:50] <TrueColors> this doens't fadeout
[03:28:52] <TrueColors> or delay
[03:28:54] <TrueColors> it just removes
[03:28:57] <TrueColors> why is it skipping?
[03:29:30] <TrueColors> okay, it does fade if I remove the delay
[03:29:33] <TrueColors> so it appears it's not doing a delay?
[03:29:41] <TrueColors> i mean, it fades if I remove the remove()
[03:30:16] <Woet> TrueColors: try $("div.modal_popup, div.modal_overlay").fadeOut(400, function(){ $(this).remove(); });
[03:30:23] <jb-> http://jsfiddle.net/Lwy3S/2/ What's wrong with get_id_asynch()? It doesn't change uid.
[03:30:28] <TrueColors> oooh
[03:30:30] <TrueColors> that looks nice
[03:30:31] <TrueColors> let me try
[03:32:05] <TrueColors> brilliant, that works.
[03:32:30] <jb-> http://jsfiddle.net/Lwy3S/2/ What's wrong with get_id_asynch()? It doesn't change uid.
[03:33:21] <Woet> there is no need to repeat yourself after 2 minutes, jb-
[03:33:43] <jb-> Woet: If no one has answered me there is
[03:34:10] <courpse> oh, everyone stop, jb- asked a question.
[03:34:25] <jb-> courpse: ohlolusofunny
[03:34:34] <Woet> jb-: ask your question and then wait
[03:34:41] <Woet> while reading documentation and trying to fix it yourself, obviously.
[03:35:06] <jb-> The jQuery docs aren't very helpful. If they were then I'd have already fixed it myself.
[03:36:08] <xtrci> hello guys can anyone help me on this?
[03:36:09] <xtrci> http://jsfiddle.net/FGRBy/
[03:36:11] <xtrci> i have this code
[03:36:23] <xtrci> the example is from this
[03:36:40] <xtrci> dev.markerout.com ( login : mdiasloureiro@gmail.com pw : teste )
[03:36:43] <Woet> jb-: "By default, all requests are sent asynchronously (i.e. this is set to true by default). If you need synchronous requests, set this option to false."
[03:37:06] <xtrci> when i click the first time on one link of the map
[03:37:12] <xtrci> it makes the request fine
[03:37:16] <xtrci> but when i click the second
[03:37:20] <xtrci> it makes 2 requests
[03:37:29] <xtrci> when i make the 3 it makes 4
[03:37:30] <xtrci> etc etc
[03:37:36] <xtrci> any ideas what's happening?
[03:37:46] <jb-> Woet: I don't need a synchronous request, I already have one.
[03:37:46] <Woet> xtrci: why don't you make a proper jsfiddle first?
[03:38:05] <Woet> jb-: the .get is async, so why do you expect a return; right below it to work?
[03:38:07] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/q5UNU/
[03:38:08] <bot-t1> (33 hours 40 mins ago) <coldhead> tell johnline you really have to change that quit message, buddy
[03:38:23] <Woet> jb-: 'uid' won't contain the data right after the .get
[03:38:48] <jb-> Woet: If I move the return inside then uid is returned as 'undefined'
[03:38:49] <airox> Hello guys
[03:38:52] <Woet> xtrci: no PHP in HTML, loading jquery instead of mootols, etc.
[03:39:01] <Woet> jb-: obviously, because the function will not wait for the .get to finish
[03:39:09] <airox> Is there an official jQuery Flot channel somewhere?
[03:39:47] <Woet> airox: there is #flot, but it's empty
[03:39:50] <Woet> does that help? :)
[03:40:05] <airox> Well I already noticed #flot and indeed it's empty :)
[03:40:09] <jb-> Woet: I haven't got any experience with asynchronous code, that's the problem.
[03:40:34] <Woet> jb-: then read the docs and get experience
[03:40:36] <Woet> they are very clear.
[03:40:46] <jb-> Not to me they aren't ..
[03:40:55] <Woet> jb-: who's fault is that?
[03:41:00] <Woet> airox: then ask here!
[03:41:09] <jb-> ohhahahahufunny2
[03:41:12] <jb-> Fuck off
[03:41:35] <jb-> I know it's silly to come to the jquery channel expecting help with jquery
[03:41:52] <jb-> I promise I won't make that mistake again chapm
[03:41:53] <Woet> it's silly to come to the jquery channel, spamming your question and blaming the docs, yes :)
[03:41:54] <jb-> champ
[03:42:04] <Woet> bye!
[03:42:32] <johnline> ohi weot
[03:42:35] <Woet> hi johnline
[03:45:02] <xtrci> i don't know how to make an jsfiddle good enough to show this thing, thats why i put the exact code i have with the real site example
[03:45:38] <Woet> ?demo @ xtrci
[03:45:39] <bot-t1> xtrci, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:46:12] <xtrci> dev.markerout.com -> login : mdiasloureiro@gmail.com password : teste
[03:46:23] <xtrci> just select on the map
[03:46:31] <xtrci> portugal map one city, it makes one request
[03:46:37] <xtrci> when you select the second time
[03:46:41] <xtrci> it makes two
[03:46:57] <Woet> johnline: http://jsfiddle.net/q5UNU/3/
[03:47:02] <xtrci> third time, 3 requests etc.. you can see the problem in the console
[03:47:08] <Woet> hope that fixes your non-stated issue.
[03:47:23] <xtrci> the code is in the jsfiddle i gave http://jsfiddle.net/FGRBy/
[03:47:49] <xtrci> it's the corresponding code of that issue
[03:48:07] <johnline> hahaha woet
[03:49:00] <Woet> xtrci: since we are lazy, we expect a working jsfiddle
[03:49:17] <TrueColors> lol
[03:49:55] <TrueColors> hm
[03:49:56] <Woet> i'm not sure what the issue is, xtrci
[03:49:59] <TrueColors> my css is cocked up in IE8.
[03:50:09] * TrueColors moves to #css
[03:50:17] <Woet> xtrci: but that's a lot of code, so put the relevant bit on jsfiddle and make it work on jsfiddle :)
[03:51:23] <xtrci> you have a map where you can select two citys, that will change the div in the middle, if you see in the console every time you try to change the city it starts making one more request
[03:55:26] <xtrci> http://jsfiddle.net/FGRBy/1/ atleast it's more clean
[03:55:42] <xtrci> just removed the loadings and stuff and map coords
[03:56:25] <Woet> xtrci: is that working for you?
[04:07:06] <ruby_on_tails> i see that the latest version of JqUI is 1.8.16
[04:07:09] <ruby_on_tails> hows that possible ?
[04:07:20] <ruby_on_tails> i have been using 1.8.2 since the last year
[04:07:26] <TrueColors> Is it fine to do $("<div></div>") ... I was told that it creates a new dom and stores it in there. look here: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2F77.86.6.216%2Fprojects%2Fplugins%2Fmodalwindow%2F
[04:07:26] <TrueColors> :/
[04:07:29] <Woet> ruby_on_tails: because 16 is larger than 2?
[04:07:59] <ruby_on_tails> thats funny
[04:10:17] <Woet> ruby_on_tails: seriously, that's how the versioning works. larger number = later version
[04:10:37] <Woet> 1.8.3, 1.8.4, 1.8.5, ..... 1.8.9, 1.8.10, 1.8.11, .... 1.8.15, 1.8.16
[04:11:54] <airox> Got it working with flot.. seemed getData and setData didn't do the trick :)
[04:12:12] <mvta> hey mates, morning
[04:12:20] <airox> realtime graphs of my home energy usage now :)
[04:12:21] <ruby_on_tails> Woet: just overread it as 1.6 instead of 16
[04:12:24] <ruby_on_tails> :P
[04:12:29] <mvta> could anybody helps me with jquerymobile question?
[04:13:09] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/q5UNU/4/ why it now work woet
[04:13:11] <TrueColors> Ok so... http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2F77.86.6.216%2Fprojects%2Fplugins%2Fmodalwindow%2F how can I fix these errors, whilst still creatin the same effect as $("<div></div>") would.
[04:13:14] <jibberJabba> airox : can we see it ?

[04:15:43] <bad_sheep> Hi, I am wondering whether there is a bug in jquery 1.6.3
[04:16:24] <jibberJabba> bad_sheep: no never
[04:16:28] <Woet> cause it's not getting the time, johnline
[04:16:46] <bad_sheep> google did change today or yesterday its version used by //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6/jquery.min.js
[04:17:46] <airox> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/593/schermafbeelding2011090q.png/
[04:17:53] <airox> hope this link works ...
[04:18:08] <airox> that would be the energy usage of the previous day
[04:18:09] <Woet> johnline: http://jsfiddle.net/q5UNU/5/
[04:18:26] <johnline> lol :Ð
[04:18:31] <jibberJabba> that looks good
[04:18:52] <airox> I monitor a lot in my home .. and creating graphs using flot
[04:19:19] <airox> This one fetches it's data from a web api .. and I am now trying to create sort of a walking graph ...
[04:19:31] <airox> Which turns in color when energy usage get's high and such
[04:23:23] <Gh0sty> hello I was wondering how I can detect which checkbox got check/unchecked to take action on it ... http://pastebin.com/Uxfic0AM
[04:23:52] <Woet> Gh0sty: jquery .change
[04:24:08] <Gh0sty> I use that ...
[04:24:20] <bad_sheep> check this http://vizionr.fr/index_1_6_3.xhtml and this http://vizionr.fr/index.xhtml ... the only difference is that index.xhtml uses 1.6.2 and index_1_6_3.xhtml uses 1.6.3 (it happens with .min versions as well) ... I have the error in all my browsers on Mac (Chrome, ffx, safari) except Opera for which both versions work
[04:24:29] <Gh0sty> but not quite sure how this works ...
[04:26:13] <bad_sheep> The error as described by ffx is the following : Erreur : uncaught exception: [Exception... "An invalid or illegal string was specified"  code: "12" nsresult: "0x8053000c (NS_ERROR_DOM_SYNTAX_ERR)"  location: "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.3/jquery.js Line: 1182"]
[04:26:27] <miketaylr> O_o
[04:26:51] <bad_sheep> I am the only one ?
[04:27:31] <miketaylr> bad_sheep: no i can confirm that error
[04:27:37] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/q5UNU/6/
[04:27:44] <johnline> hmm, i wanna stagger the hair
[04:28:17] <miketaylr> bad_sheep: i'm guessing the problem is that you can't use innerHTML w/ application/xhtml+xml. so they need to fix that.
[04:28:31] <miketaylr> bad_sheep: can you file a bug at bugs.jquery.com?
[04:28:36] <bad_sheep> I am gonna check with jquery 1.6.3 from jquery itself, not from google, their file may be corrupted
[04:28:39] <bad_sheep> yes
[04:28:44] <miketaylr> no, their file is the same
[04:29:14] <miketaylr> line 1182 is " div.innerHTML = "   <link><table></table><a href='/a' style='top:1px;float:left;opacity:.55;'>a</a><input type=checkbox>";"
[04:31:34] <Gh0sty> Woet: the .change detects there is a change of a checkbox but I want to know WHICH one ...
[04:31:53] <Woet> Gh0sty: that is passed to the .change callback in $(this)?
[04:32:06] <Woet> Gh0sty: and you should already know that before binding .change
[04:32:41] <Woet> Gh0sty: $("checkbox").change(function(){ console.log($(this).attr('name')); });
[04:35:55] <bad_sheep> OK, I have created a bug report here : http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10197 . Thank you, have a good day
[04:35:56] <Gh0sty> ah there is a $(this)
[04:36:00] <Gh0sty> thx Woet
[04:36:17] <Gh0sty> pretty new to jquery ... first time I use it :p
[04:45:30] <mvta> hey mates
[04:45:43] <mvta> does anybody work with jquerymobile?
[04:46:47] <airox> mvta: there is a seperate channel at #jquerymobile
[04:49:48] <Gh0sty> last question ... say I have var caller="chk2" how can I use caller in this line replacing the chk2: $('#chk2').is(':checked')
[04:50:49] <mvta> airox: I know, but everybody are sleeping :S
[04:50:51] <Gh0sty> was trying $('#$caller').is(':checked') but doesnt seem to work :/
[04:52:56] <Gh0sty> oh just +caller
[05:18:47] <Back2Basics> is there a way to show/hide a jquery tab?  (i've been removing and adding but that distroy's the ID)
[05:22:48] <donCams> .hide() ?
[05:23:07] <donCams> oh. it's jquery ui. no idea
[05:25:08] <donCams> Back2Basics, maybe add a class that sets it to display: none;
[05:25:31] <dr0id> $('*').remove();
[05:25:43] <donCams> don't troll
[05:25:54] <dr0id> sup troll

[05:27:09] <donCams> hey. i gave a legit answer
[06:09:01] <SpaT> I need a form with an input box and an Add button. when the add button is hit there needs to be a click-able entry with a remove button next to it. I think I can solve this problem with the datatables plugin but I want to be sure this is the right aproach
[06:10:18] <SpaT> I guess it looks like a file upload form but without the file part

[07:16:27] <nail_> pickels: 'elem' : $el.html()   but in your example it's empty, $('p') doesn't select anything
[07:19:40] <pickels> nail_, yep that p should be <p>
[07:21:31] <oudeis> Hi guys. Why wouldn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/jM6WQ/ The idea is to highlight a table row or cell. I have tried with $("tr").click…. too, also doesn't work
[07:23:33] <cole_gillespie> oudeis, let me take a look
[07:25:00] <cole_gillespie> looks like your ready handler is wrong
[07:25:20] <cole_gillespie> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[07:26:58] <cole_gillespie> oudeis, see if this works
[07:26:59] <cole_gillespie> http://jsfiddle.net/jM6WQ/1/
[07:28:13] <oudeis> cole_gillespie, thanks
[07:28:23] <cole_gillespie> do you know what you did wrong?
[07:28:44] <cole_gillespie> when you declare document ready you cannot just say $( ... )
[07:29:00] <cole_gillespie> you need to say $(function(){ .. });
[07:29:04] <oudeis> put the code straight in the $()
[07:29:06] <oudeis> yes
[07:29:25] <oudeis> so that function reference  will be saved and executed when dom is ready?
[07:32:11] <oudeis> cole_gillespie, so, i was executing code straight in the document.ready body, instead of passing it a function reference, this was the mistake?
[07:34:00] <nail_> well in your case the actual mistake was the missing ) to close click(), as you ran that after having declared the table
[07:34:09] <nail_> wrapping that in $() is just a noop
[07:35:22] <cole_gillespie> nail_, you are right
[07:35:25] <cole_gillespie> i made that change too
[07:35:40] <cole_gillespie> so you can say $( ... ) and it is the same as document ready?
[07:36:14] <nail_> no, but the <script> was after the declaration of the table, so it would work without waiting for the dom ready
[07:36:18] <nail_> bad practice though :)
[07:36:56] <cole_gillespie> gotcha
[07:37:27] <nail_> you can actually remove the outer $() in his example, that will still work
[07:38:04] <cole_gillespie> but it would be best to wrap it in a dom ready function
[07:38:14] <cole_gillespie> just for the sake of good practice

[08:16:19] <starsinmypockets> I'm trying to define a variable as an attribute of an 'a' element, then use that as part of a selector... I'm not sure if my syntax is quite right... http://pastebin.com/1cKNVqvP
[08:22:26] <xerox> is there an equivalent of windows.onload for .html(...) ?
[08:22:30] <xerox> *window
[08:23:31] <imsky> no
[08:28:10] <flayks> hi there
[08:29:05] <flayks> i make an horizontal scroll with jquery ui draggable but i can't set a containment... do you have an idea ? (large parge ~4.5mo !) http://projets.flayks.com/pyreneesgraff/index.html
[08:33:45] <starsinmypockets> Why doesn't this statement target the grandchild element (.views-field-title)... it is undefined :/     $(this).children('div.hoverbox > .views-field-title')
[08:34:33] <Duckpaste> because its not a child of $(this) i guess?
[08:35:12] <Duckpaste> could you not do .children('div.hoverbox).children('.views-field-title') ?
[08:35:40] <xerox> imsky: how can I make sure that my script will run when the new html loaded in the page with $(some element).html(new html containing script tags) is in place?
[08:36:02] <imsky> include javascript in your html
[08:36:18] <imsky> that runs whatever you need
[08:36:41] <starsinmypockets> Duckpaste - I could but it's a bit cumbursome since I'm going down like 4 levels
[08:37:30] <xerox> imsky: right but it binds event listeners to elements of the new html.  when the page first loads I use $(function() { ... }) to wait for the onload event, there is no such need with .html(...) ?
[08:37:48] <imsky> well obviously
[08:37:48] <cole_gillespie> starsinmypockets, i found an awesome lib to fix what you are trying to do
[08:37:56] <imsky> you're modifying the DOM after the page has loaded
[08:38:07] <starsinmypockets> cole_gillespie tmm
[08:38:11] <cole_gillespie> https://github.com/spicyj/jquery-genealogy
[08:38:16] <cole_gillespie> i had the same problem
[08:38:23] <cole_gillespie> but this is a problem within jquery
[08:38:28] <imsky> xerox: load your html into a jquery object and then bind your stuff there
[08:38:29] <cole_gillespie> one that resig is aware of
[08:38:35] <imsky> then just append it
[08:39:36] <cole_gillespie> starsinmypockets, if you do not want to use a lib you have to keep going down the ladder or children until you get to where you want to go
[08:39:56] <xerox> imsky: will the order be enough to make sure, say, the a is in the dom before the script is run in this tiny example, as well as more complex pages?  $(...).html('<a id="new-link" href="..">new link</a><script>$("#new-link").dostuff</script>')
[08:40:35] <cole_gillespie> xerox, never assume the order will be enough
[08:40:36] <starsinmypockets> cole_gillespie hmm i'm suprised there's not a more elegant solution
[08:40:58] <imsky> xerox, oh no that's not going to work
[08:41:05] <xerox> dang
[08:41:13] <xerox> I suspected as much : (
[08:41:18] <imsky> it's optimistic though :P
[08:41:22] <xerox> :D
[08:42:02] <cole_gillespie> starsinmypockets, why do you need to do such extensive children calling? why can you not just grab the dom ele by id or class name that you want to get children from?
[08:42:06] <miketaylr> starsinmypockets: children only looks down one level, use find
[08:42:14] <xerox> I'm doing history.js stuff, that's the reason the scripts are there
[08:42:21] <xerox> (in the html I get from the server)
[08:42:28] <imsky> 0_o
[08:42:45] <xerox> so people without a modern browser load the whole page, whereas html5-enabled ones only parts of the page
[08:43:20] <imsky> that sounds like
[08:43:24] <imsky> overengineering
[08:43:41] <xerox> basically this https://gist.github.com/854622
[08:43:50] <xerox> but by hand, not with that magic script
[08:44:08] <starsinmypockets> miketaylr ++
[08:44:11] <starsinmypockets> that's the stuff thanks
[08:44:13] <imsky> yep sounds like overengineering
[08:44:21] <miketaylr> np starsinmypockets
[08:45:51] <cole_gillespie> xerox, what are you trying to do? i think i have done something similar i might be able to help
[08:45:52] <xerox> whoa, .html() is magical
[08:46:22] <Ankabout> is there a way I can target an element, but only a part of it (like the top 50%) ?
[08:46:27] <xerox> I just tried $(some element).html('<script>$(function() { console.log('boop') })</script>') and it did work
[08:46:41] <xerox> I owe a beer to whoever made that work
[08:47:16] <xerox> cole_gillespie: *exactly* what that script does, but baked into the site, not added as an afterthought like it
[08:47:57] <cole_gillespie> to the .html() just adds some html inth $(some element ) right?
[08:48:20] <xerox> replaces it, yeah
[08:49:18] <xerox> the <script> in it gets fired, and $(function() { ... }) works perfectly, like there was a window.onload
[08:49:22] <xerox> A+
[08:51:17] <xerox> thanks for the chat people : )
[08:53:18] <starsinmypockets> How can I use mouseenter() only after the mouse has remained on the element for a certain amount of time?
[08:55:04] <cal_> whats wrong with this? :  alert(div.find('id*=mydiv').innerHTML)
[09:02:23] <zingbats> I'm using JSONP to access a site on another domain. The server responds with the callback function wrapped around the JSON. What should the context type of this be? Because the error func is still saying parseerror.
[09:02:59] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, can you post your code?
[09:03:05] <zingbats> Yeah. Hang on.
[09:03:08] <cole_gillespie> i might be able to help you if you throw it up in a jsfiddle
[09:04:20] <zingbats> http://jsfiddle.net/b53h3
[09:04:37] <zingbats> Erm. Hang on :S
[09:05:09] <zingbats> I'm going to use pastebin, if thats ok.
[09:05:55] <zingbats> http://pastebin.com/VxucZ9qY
[09:07:16] <bgy> hi
[09:08:33] <bgy> I'm trying to .bind('dblclick') on <p> in <p><a href="something">some text</a></p> I'd like to prevent the link to be followed, I tried event.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); e.stopImmediatePropagation(); and return false; but none works, any ideas?
[09:09:40] <courpse> bgy, Without a codepaste, people can only guess.
[09:10:13] <jdevel> sounds like the code takes after your handle :/
[09:11:24] <cal_> whats wrong with this? :  alert(div.find('id*=mydiv').innerHTML)
[09:11:34] <jdevel> add event handlers to both and see which is triggered first
[09:11:45] <jdevel> what is dev?
[09:11:47] <jdevel> div
[09:11:48] <jdevel> rather
[09:12:19] <jdevel> that selector is no good too
[09:12:24] <cal_> a jquery command to find all divs?
[09:12:28] <bgy> courpse: ok, did it
[09:12:30] <bgy> http://jsfiddle.net/bQD7P/
[09:12:31] <courpse> lol.
[09:12:59] <jdevel> are you finding all divs inside of div?
[09:13:00] <bgy> If I click on the link, I'm redirected, I want to prevent that but bind the parent element
[09:13:07] <cal_> yes
[09:13:37] <cal_> finding the mydiv div within the outer div
[09:13:38] <jdevel> .find('div').innerHTML should work fine
[09:13:57] <jdevel> or
[09:14:10] <jdevel> .find('#mydiv').innerHTML
[09:14:43] <jdevel> the pound symbol is for ID's regarding selector syntax.. same as CSS
[09:15:15] <cal_> okay. yeah i am not new to javascript but new to jquery
[09:15:38] <cal_> this guy did all this stuff in jquery swearing that it is easier. i am not seeing it.
[09:16:23] <cal_> i can do div.getElementById('innerdiv').innerHTML and accomplish the same thing. both are one line of code.
[09:16:56] <jdevel> yea, but jquery is less characters
[09:17:29] <courpse> bgy, Look in your console, you should see unxpected ; errors.
[09:17:34] <cal_> every line of code i see him doing in jquery is just as easy to me in javascript, like... the code wont grow by a page or even a few lines if i changed it to core javascript
[09:17:54] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, i am looking now
[09:18:04] <jdevel> cal_ that's up to you then.
[09:18:21] <cole_gillespie> cal_, run a jsPerf test at jsperf.com
[09:18:27] <cal_> i kind of agree its somewhat of a cool syntax
[09:18:28] <bgy> courpse: well my html code on fiddle was not updated, however, I'm not getting any errors, I had to bind click event of <a> element outside and preventDefault there
[09:18:30] <cal_> on the fence. ;)
[09:18:42] <cole_gillespie> what you will find is that the native getElebyId is ALOT faster than jquery's equiv
[09:18:49] <cole_gillespie> it is just not a pretty
[09:19:08] <cal_> so div.find('id_of_inner_div').innerHTML?
[09:19:28] <cole_gillespie> yes, have you ever used jsperf.com before?
[09:20:25] <cal_> no, will check it out
[09:20:35] <zingbats> The only way firebug is showing any resonse from my AJAX request, is if the type is "jsonp". But no matter what the dataType is, the remote script still executes, I just can't view the response. Is that expected?
[09:20:56] <TrueColors> hm
[09:21:05] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, have you ever used the charles debugging proxy?
[09:21:09] <cal_> and what is this .val() when .value works just fine.. lol stuff like that
[09:21:12] <cole_gillespie> it helps alot when doing xdomain requests
[09:21:17] <zingbats> cole_gillespie, no I haven't.
[09:21:25] <cole_gillespie> what platform are you on?
[09:21:25] <zingbats> And the URL is on another domain to the request
[09:21:30] <Duckpaste> bgy: http://jsfiddle.net/bQD7P/4/
[09:21:42] <TrueColors> http://77.86.6.216/projects/HSN/V2/register.php click Sign Up, don't fill anything in. That modal window, is suppose to submit the form. However, the Javascript appears like: $(&quot;form#register&quot;).submit();	
[09:21:47] <zingbats> Firefox 6, Win 7, and tk
[09:21:49] <zingbats> erm
[09:21:49] <TrueColors> like it's escapin the quotes
[09:22:37] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, http://www.charlesproxy.com/download/ is awesome when doing debugging of ajax
[09:22:44] <cole_gillespie> it really lets you see what the response is
[09:22:54] <cole_gillespie> in all sorts of different forms
[09:23:07] <cole_gillespie> it is a bit more intensive than firebugs proxy
[09:23:16] <cole_gillespie> but, h/o i am taking a look at your code
[09:23:52] <zingbats> cole_gillespie, the thing is, it's a cross-site request, and to make matters worse, it's in a firefox jetpack extension. Which makes me wonder if the extension security settings prevent the callback func being created?
[09:24:20] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, one thing that might really help you
[09:24:23] <zingbats> the exension doesnt have direct access to "document" so any funcs it creates in that space have to be careful
[09:24:26] <cole_gillespie> stop using alert
[09:24:30] <cole_gillespie> and use console.log
[09:24:33] <cole_gillespie> and download chrome
[09:24:37] <cole_gillespie> because chromes dev tools
[09:24:43] <cole_gillespie> are SOOO much better than firebug
[09:24:44] <zingbats> I can't use chrome, because this is in a ff extension :P
[09:24:51] <cole_gillespie> oh
[09:24:56] <cole_gillespie> that is to bad
[09:25:12] <zingbats> and yeah console.log is fine, but I like my alerts :P
[09:25:26] <cole_gillespie> old school
[09:25:28] <cole_gillespie> i get it
[09:25:28] <TrueColors> can anyone.. assist me lol
[09:26:14] <imsky> cole_gillespie: chrome's dev tools are different, not better
[09:26:54] <cole_gillespie> imsky, maybe it is just me but inspecting objects in chrome dev tools is much easier to read by a human than in firebug
[09:27:11] <cole_gillespie> it lets you really drill down into the object
[09:27:12] <imsky> hmm i can see that
[09:27:20] <imsky> but really, you can get used to both of them
[09:27:22] <cole_gillespie> that is the only advantage
[09:27:27] <imsky> for CSS, firebug is much better
[09:28:56] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, what if you just said in your success eval( resp )
[09:29:14] <cole_gillespie> and then create a function that has the same name as the response
[09:29:16] <zingbats> It doesnt even call success
[09:29:22] <zingbats> it just calls error
[09:29:22] <cole_gillespie> oh
[09:29:30] <zingbats> yup
[09:29:34] <zingbats> or i'd eval it like you said
[09:30:00] <cole_gillespie> so are you sure that you are passing the right params?
[09:30:14] <beakybal4> hi
[09:30:32] <zingbats> Well my script emails me a copy of what's echo'd on the PHP side.
[09:30:38] <cole_gillespie> for example, you have function mh_Ajax() but it does not accept any params
[09:30:46] <beakybal4> can you replace a string within an iframe with another string?
[09:30:53] <TrueColors> http://77.86.6.216/projects/HSN/V2/register.php click on the sign up button, and take a look at the code for the modal (the html), the javascript is showing &quot; instead of "
[09:30:58] <zingbats> thats an object, so elsewhere there's new mh_Ajax();
[09:31:25] <zingbats> In firebug I can see the response if the dataType is JSONP
[09:31:31] <zingbats> and it's correct
[09:31:36] <zingbats> it just errors still
[09:33:22] <gurumelo> TrueColors: i don't see &quot;
[09:33:22] <Ankabout> is there a way I can target an element, but only a part of it (like the top 50%) ?
[09:33:46] <cole_gillespie> zing how does this.post = function(URL, params, successFunc, failure) { }) know what URL is if you do not pass it into the parent function
[09:33:51] <TrueColors> This is what i'm seeing gurumelo: http://vvcap.net/db/Lx1fIB-tWDPvHW_NxpF-.htp (image)
[09:34:11] <TrueColors> but it's suppose to submit the form, and i'm guessing.. it's not because of the quotes
[09:34:57] <zingbats> cole_gillespie, what? You call mh_AjaxInstance.post("relative/file.php"....)
[09:35:10] <zingbats> and then post adds the path to the baseURL var
[09:35:32] <gurumelo> TrueColors: i see good: $("form#register").submit(function(e)
[09:35:35] <cole_gillespie> oh, gotcha
[09:35:44] <TrueColors> oh no, you're looking at the wrong source...
[09:35:51] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, can you send me a sample link so i can test it on my side?
[09:35:55] <cole_gillespie> for example
[09:35:57] <TrueColors> In chrome, I open up the modal and inspect element on that.
[09:36:00] <TrueColors> and look in there
[09:36:17] <cole_gillespie> what would the http://ocaelus.com/mhanalysis/ expect to receive as far as params go
[09:36:17] <Duckpaste> P:\Users\Ross\Desktop\alert.bat
[09:36:18] <gurumelo> i use firefox, i see well the submit method
[09:36:30] <TrueColors> firebug?
[09:36:36] <TrueColors> or just a ctrl + u ?
[09:37:01] <gurumelo> ctrl + u, and iframe with captcha is ok
[09:37:10] <zingbats> cole_gillespie, it's a firefox extension.... To make matters worse, you need to login to the facebook app it's injecting in to, so it's not worth it :P However, charles' proxy has shown that the respnse is valid, it's just stupid firebug / jquery not displayin git
[09:37:16] <beakybal4> hi can someone help me replace a string in an iframe with another string?
[09:37:34] <ravenzz> ?demo gurumelo
[09:37:35] <bot-t1> ravenzz, Couldn't find "demo gurumelo" in jQuery Docs.
[09:37:40] <ravenzz> lul
[09:37:44] <ravenzz> ?demo @ gurumelo
[09:37:45] <bot-t1> gurumelo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:38:01] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, i guess that my expertise has run out then. i have never built any ff extensions =/
[09:38:05] <TrueColors> No, gurumelo, the javascript I shown is IN the iframe... the content of the iframe
[09:38:10] <TrueColors> you can't see it with a ctrl + u
[09:38:18] <TrueColors> you can navigate to page.php but that shows fine
[09:38:30] <gurumelo> ok, i will see it
[09:38:43] <zingbats> cole_gillespie, I understand. I'm going to keep using charles' proxy
[09:39:20] <cole_gillespie> zingbats, charles is amazing
[09:39:24] <gurumelo> same, TrueColors , i see in page.php : $("form#register").submit();
[09:39:39] <cole_gillespie> if anything atleast i introduced that to you
[09:39:41] <TrueColors> did you actually NAVIGATE to the page? because it works fine like that.
[09:40:09] <zingbats> cole_gillespie, indeed it is. The trouble is, it's a proxy. So it's showing the data fine, but that's before FF has applied its cross-site security.
[09:40:13] <gurumelo> yes
[09:40:21] <TrueColors> you shouldn't of done that, i told you it works fine like that.
[09:40:26] <TrueColors> *facepalm
[09:40:28] <zingbats> So I now know the website is responding correctly, but I still have no idea why jQuery isn't seeing it
[09:40:44] <TrueColors> Anyone with chrome, or firebug willing to verify I'm not going nuts? lol
[09:42:51] <TrueColors> http://77.86.6.216/projects/HSN/V2/register.php - click Sign Up, inspect element (chrome/firebug) on the modal window... and have a look at the javascript within the head tags which is within the iframe. The javascript has &quot; instead of "
[09:42:56] <TrueColors> am I the only one seeing this?
[09:43:04] <gurumelo> TrueColors: http://i.imgur.com/adsHd.png
[09:43:35] <TrueColors> hm
[09:43:55] <TrueColors> didy ou get an alert as you clicked the signup button? like to say "hi" ? o.o
[09:43:59] <ravenzz> TrueColors i can see that
[09:44:07] <TrueColors> oh shoot wait.
[09:44:10] <TrueColors> i didn't save my file
[09:44:30] <skript> lol
[09:44:35] <gurumelo> : )
[09:44:48] <brian_petersen> how do i create a web page with a right sidebar that is in a fixed position, is scrollable, and has a minimize button?
[09:45:12] <skript> brian_petersen, check out dojo
[09:45:14] <TrueColors> ok well
[09:45:17] <TrueColors> I see the quotes, but it does work
[09:45:28] <TrueColors> must be some chrome thing. i'll take a gander in firebug
[09:45:58] <TrueColors> displays fine in firebug.
[09:46:14] <TrueColors> hm... wonder why that is then. my other iframe javascript looks fine in chrome
[09:46:15] <TrueColors> just not this one
[09:46:16] <TrueColors> lol
[09:46:19] <ravenzz> TrueColors i can't see any submit button on the modal dialog
[09:46:44] <TrueColors> no, it submits in js (out of laziness to test if what i wanted worked)
[09:47:22] <ravenzz> you cant submit the form from an iframe
[09:48:20] <TrueColors> Well, reload the page. Click the sign up button, and alert saying "hi" shows up, which only works when th... shoot.
[09:48:23] <TrueColors> the button type is submit
[09:48:42] <TrueColors> yeah okay uhm
[09:48:50] <TrueColors> that doesn't work then
[09:48:58] <TrueColors> Iframes are bad, what's best to use instead?
[09:49:12] <TrueColors> well, apparently they are bad for this kind of usage (but either way, it doesn't do what I want)
[09:49:44] <ravenzz> just make the modal as part of the registration form
[09:49:51] <TrueColors> basically what happens is you click sign up, it validates if all fields are filled in - it shows the user verification and terms. If correct, it's suppose to submit the form with all the registration details in.. and do whatever.
[09:49:53] <TrueColors> what do you mean?
[09:50:01] <ravenzz> the submit the value and check it on the backend
[09:51:03] <TrueColors> oh right yeah, scrap the modal and ... stick the userverification in the form?
[09:52:13] <ravenzz> yes
[09:52:36] <TrueColors> well the thing is, in my opinion -  other sites are high on fancy features, and I'm trying to get them in too.
[09:52:44] <TrueColors> I've noticed facebook has modals without iframes.
[09:52:49] <TrueColors> so I'm wondering how they do it
[09:52:52] <gurumelo> TrueColors: http://www.queness.com/resources/html/project/index.html
[09:53:15] <gurumelo> TrueColors: use free software, free your software
[09:53:43] <starsinmypockets> I'm trying to create a popup that opens after an element is in focus for 1sec :  $(this).delay(1000).addClass('hasFocus');    then	if ($(this).hasClass('hasFocus')){  ... }
[09:53:56] <TrueColors> I tend to write my own shiz, it helps me in the learning process.
[09:54:07] <TrueColors> I run into problems like... now, and then I learn to fix.
[09:54:10] <starsinmypockets> So that the element won't have the 'hasFocus' class for 1 sec, and when it does, do the ajax hit..
[09:54:17] <starsinmypockets> But it doesn't work - it loads immediately
[10:01:09] <starsinmypockets> Hmm - or this http://pastebin.com/sg9xxhzK ?
[10:02:21] <TrueColors> JavaScript doesn't have to be within head tags does it?
[10:02:29] <TrueColors> Apparently it's better at the bottom of the body
[10:02:35] <TrueColors> but why do people put it in the head ?
[10:03:06] <ravenzz> TrueColors http://jsfiddle.net/b7YJW/1/
[10:03:48] <TrueColors> that is a possibility.
[10:04:05] <TrueColors> having two divs, one as ... form1, and the other has form2, both in the same form tag though
[10:04:10] <TrueColors> so you can ... hide one, show the other.
[10:04:28] <TrueColors> I guess what I'm doing is a bit extreme
[10:04:46] <ravenzz> yes, basically you should place in the head the js you need to be executed beforeall
[10:05:10] <ravenzz> TrueColors why do you need 2 forms?
[10:05:34] <TrueColors> I just mean like <div id="form1">
[10:05:37] <TrueColors> not actual form tags
[10:11:33] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/b7YJW/2/ like that
[10:14:58] <ravenzz> oh i saw that you would to maintain the modal dialog
[10:15:13] <Travis-42> I have an autocomplete-like function that is sending ajax requests on every key press. If the user presses one key, then presses a second, how can I know in the success function for the first request that a second request is still going on?
[10:21:04] <ravenzz> TrueColors http://jsfiddle.net/b7YJW/3/
[10:22:35] <TrueColors> that's nice.
[10:22:59] <TrueColors> ,How do you handle 404's with $.get ?
[10:23:29] <TrueColors> or any kind of error for that matter.
[10:23:52] <ravenzz> would you submit that form by ajax?
[10:24:50] <IanWizard-Mobile> hey guys :)
[10:24:50] <TrueColors> No, I'm making a slight change so that I can handle ajax requests in the modal window,  it would be useful later on.
[10:24:54] <TrueColors> so i don't need to use iframes
[10:26:13] <IanWizard-Mobile> is there a way that I can use jQuery to parse, and edit (in a sensible jQuery style :) ) CSS as a string?  (from a text area?)
[10:26:55] <bot-t1> IanWizard-Mobile, Ariel Flesler: jQuery.Rule - http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[10:27:11] <TrueColors> if yo utake a look at this: http://77.86.6.216/projects/plugins/modalwindow/ it uses an ajax call, but the file it's trying to call does not exist. I got it to display "An error occured" by doing $.get(blah, function() { blah }).error(function() { ... });
[10:27:17] <TrueColors> but
[10:27:37] <TrueColors> I still get two errors: http://vvcap.net/db/glDkO22WGIdz-sMpcvI2.htp
[10:27:39] <TrueColors> i want them handled nicely.
[10:27:44] <TrueColors> Even though, there is a return false
[10:27:53] <TrueColors> it shouldn't actually get that far.
[10:28:07] <TrueColors> oh..
[10:28:22] <TrueColors> i realise why that's doing that
[10:28:48] <IanWizard-Mobile> thank you bot-1, but are you really a bot?
[10:29:23] <TrueColors> ?get
[10:29:24] <bot-t1> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[10:29:27] <TrueColors> yes he is ;)
[10:32:48] <IanWizard-Mobile> true yeah, I kinda thought so ;)
[10:33:15] <Androo> if an element was assigned a data value like so $(elem).data('kind', 'a'), then shouldn't $('.elem-class:data(kind=a)') select it?
[10:39:26] <TrueColors> }).error(function() { alert("An ajax error occurred."); $.modal.error = true; });
[10:39:29] <TrueColors> then later on i do..
[10:39:32] <TrueColors> if ( $.modal.error === true ) return ( false );
[10:39:35] <TrueColors> put it this way
[10:39:41] <TrueColors> changing that reutnr with an alert, it won't alert.
[10:39:52] <TrueColors> it appears it's not setting $.modal.errro
[10:40:54] <TrueColors> http://77.86.6.216/projects/plugins/modalwindow/ feel free to see, the alert shows up but not the second.
[10:44:01] <TrueColors> I see now.
[10:44:04] <lunks> Hello, does anybody can point me to a select/autocomplete I can use?
[10:44:05] <TrueColors> it doesn't wait until the ajax call is complete.
[10:44:35] <lunks> There is one name combobox() somewhere in the jquery docs that do not actually support optgroups. :/
[10:49:48] <bgy> I'm using $.post() how could I set a var outside of the $.post() scope? I mean I've var summary = ''; $.post('page.php', function(data) { summary = data.summary; }); but summary is not set correctly
[10:50:19] <ajpiano> bgy: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[10:50:41] <ajpiano> lunks: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[10:51:03] <lunks> ajpiano: Thank you! :D
[10:52:25] <ajpiano> :)
[10:53:29] <bgy> ajpiano: thank you, so far I understand summary will contain my 'summary' data but in a later time, right?
[10:53:38] <ajpiano> yes
[10:53:48] <ajpiano> you have to use callbacks and accept that things are async
[10:55:57] <bgy> ajpiano: ok, so I just need to add async: true; then? right?
[10:56:03] <ajpiano> no
[10:56:07] <ajpiano> they already are async
[10:56:20] <ajpiano> you could add async false but then you block the page and just avoid doing things right for longer
[10:56:47] <TrueColors> ok I've... kinda sorted it out now.
[10:57:04] <TrueColors> a 404 error still occurs, but not to worry... I suppose it's expected considering I put in a inexistant file
[10:58:09] <bgy> ajpiano: yeah I just checked that on jquery doc, but I'm not sure to understand what do I need to do then
[10:58:58] <ajpiano> bgy: you have to learn how asynchronous javascript applications work
[10:59:07] <ajpiano> sorry that it's happening on labor day weekend
[10:59:12] <ajpiano> but there's a time for everyone
[10:59:13] <ajpiano> http://nathansjslessons.appspot.com/lesson?id=1090
[11:01:29] <bgy> ajpiano: mm, ok, I'll take a look to that, thanks
[11:05:44] <Androo> If $('.class:data(kind)') selects elements with the kind data set (by jQuery), then why doesn't $('.class:data(kind=foo)') select those with kind=foo?
[11:08:59] <skript> Androo, http://dean.edwards.name/my/cssQuery/
[11:11:15] <Androo> skript: so you're saying jQuery lacks this?
[11:20:06] <oudeis> how can i tell whether $('foo') found anything?
[11:20:16] <oudeis> it returns an object whether elements matched or not
[11:20:45] <skript> oudeis, set a var on it
[11:20:48] <skript> or just say
[11:20:57] <skript> console.log( $('foo') )
[11:21:05] <dAnjou> hi, a strange problem: alert(data.result); shows the expected string, $("#result").text('foobar'); inserts "foobar" in the expected <span id="result"></span>, but $("#result").text(data.result); does nothing ... what is this sorcery?
[11:21:43] <dAnjou> data is a json response
[11:22:12] <oudeis> skript, i need to use it as a condition -- found or not found
[11:22:25] <ravenzz> dAnjou can you provide a live demo?
[11:22:53] <dAnjou> ravenzz: unfortunatly not, server is local
[11:23:03] <oudeis> skript, something like if ($('#main-table textarea')) ….  -- but it will always be true
[11:23:56] <dAnjou> ravenzz: but there was a "," in data.result ... i just tried to return a result without "," and it worked
[11:24:02] <ravenzz> dAnjou then paste your json output string somewere?
[11:26:11] <dAnjou> ravenzz: how can i do that? ... maybe i'm stupid just now
[11:26:25] <tmayr> dAnjou: just use a var in jsFiddle and mimic your data there, ej: var jsonData = '{"result":"foobar"}'; jsonData = $.parseJSON(jsonData);
[11:26:34] <tmayr> that should be enough i guess
[11:28:56] <dAnjou> result was an array -.-
[11:29:19] <oudeis> skript, ok found how: $('foo').length > 0)
[11:29:46] <dAnjou> thanks for your time
[11:49:15] <freeed> Hi, i'm using .load() to preload some images, and am wondering if there is a way to listen to the data that has been loaded? I want to make a little incrementing progress bar (not a gif) but unsure how to know how much data has loaded so I can build a line that grows to show the image download progress. Ideas?
[11:50:10] <detain> What SCM  environment does everyone recomend ? trying to find one w/ the nicest interface and has supprot for at least SVN and GIT  ?
[11:52:16] <progrock> freeed: I dont think you can track progress of a single image, but say ou were loading 10 images, everytime 1 completes you could increment 10%
[11:53:12] <progrock> detain: I just started using IDEA for a few months... tho Im still a die hard VIM user most of the time
[11:53:24] <freeed> progrock :( really want something that tells me how many bytes of a .load() call have been downloaded
[11:53:38] <progrock> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EUTEPFq5iQ&feature=player_embedded
[11:54:06] <progrock> freeed: first off, you shoul dbe using ajax, load is jsut a shortcut for ajax that is less useful
[11:55:08] <freeed> progrock... ahhhh that's what I'm looking for! thanks :)
[11:55:08] <progrock> freeed: I'm 99% sure is not possible with jquery.. and maybe not possibl at all with javascript
[12:02:05] <freeed> progrock, yea.. thinking you're correct :( Not finding anything with .ajax() or traditional js ajax that incrementally returns the bytes downloaded thus far :\
[12:27:13] <Krinkle> Hi, I'm using the jQuery ui dialog to present a form. Is there a way I can trigger a confirmation before the dialog closes when people click the close button (X on top right corner)
[12:27:35] <Krinkle> ie. Do you want to save foo ? Or "Are you sure you want to ..?"
[12:52:36] <brian_petersen> I have a right fixed sidebar, how do i create a hide button so it will be pushed off the screen (to the right), but than be pushed back onto the screen once they push the show button?
[12:54:28] <jonkri> while i'm loading my page, i register a couple of .click() event callbacks on some elements. however, it seems that clicks that occur while the page is loading are not causing these callbacks to be called. any advice for me? :)
[12:54:37] <TrueColors> ravenzz, i'm probs going to do it like yours... the problem with a modal is that it can be bypassed
[12:54:42] <TrueColors> with disabling javascript
[12:55:12] <TrueColors> and i can't think of a way for it to detect on the proper form submition that the captcha was done correctly.
[12:57:10] <butterfly> hello ;)
[12:57:35] <butterfly> anyone know why loader.gif is not animated in web browser?
[12:58:37] <TrueColors> you could provide a link
[13:07:30] <Krinkle> Is it possible to insert a (new) element after X and then append X to the new element ?
[13:08:16] <Krinkle> the new element already has several children and events bound, so .wrap() won't work
[13:08:31] <Krinkle> for some reason I get a DOM exception (append to self), makes sense in a way
[13:09:30] <Krinkle> var $x = createNewX(), $el = $(this); $el.after( $x ); $x.append( $el );
[13:10:30] <sean`> ?wrap @ Krinkle
[13:10:31] <bot-t> Krinkle, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[13:16:53] <Krinkle> sean`: .wrap() doesn't work for me, as I said. wrap() clones the jQuery object (problem 1) and it puts 'this' as deep as possible in the child structure (problem 2, since it should be appended to it)
[13:17:08] <Krinkle> anyway, I realize I gave the solution before you answered.
[13:17:15] <Krinkle> I did it wrong
[13:17:21] <sean`> .....
[13:17:33] <sean`> You want to insert a new element after X and then insert X into the new element
[13:17:37] <sean`> that's 'wrapping'
[13:17:56] <Krinkle> Well, there is code between creating the new element and appending something to it
[13:18:04] <sean`> Ofcourse
[13:18:14] <sean`> but given that simple piece ofinformation, wrap is the answer
[13:18:38] <Krinkle> I said "the new element already has several children and events bound, so .wrap() won't work"
[13:18:39] <sean`> anyway, we fixed it :D
[13:18:54] <Krinkle> anyway, thank :)
[13:19:05] <TrueColors> anyway, can I do this too?
[13:19:06] <TrueColors> lol
[13:47:38] <Accelerator> So, I'm looking for a way to use jQuery for a form submission process.. I'm wandering if there's something like this already out there. Basically, there are stages of an application. And it'll be a jQuery form that gathers this information, then fades in and out of "pages" for one big form.
[13:54:16] <selckin> anyone know a nice autocompleter that allows you to return sets of suggestions with a title etc ?
[13:55:47] <fris> selckin here are a few http://choosedaily.com/1308/15-jquery-autocomplete-plugins-tutorials/
[14:31:46] <intellilogic> Is this possible?  AJ_Test("$(this).closest("tr")")   (for onclick) because the page keeps changing via AJAX, it's not working form document ready.
[14:41:16] <jinxdone> intellilogic, either you need to re-bind your click handlers when you load new content via ajax, or preferrably, use either .live() or .deferred()
[14:42:13] <jinxdone> errm.. i ment delegate() not deferred
[15:37:08] <wesada> Hi all.
[15:38:28] <wesada> I'd like to pass HTML back to the server via ajax, but I'm not sure of the cleanest way to do it.  I have an API expecting PUT when I update, and I'd like to pass every between the body tags back.
[15:39:23] <wesada> I have form elements that need to passed back as well.  I thought I could somehow attach the html to the form, but alas no dice.
[15:39:42] <DataLess> anyone have success making jquery ui work with jquery mobile?
[15:40:17] <DataLess> currently using the star rating plugin and require ui and mobile (at least for now)
[15:40:32] <jankidudel> hi, why $('a').live('click', function(){   must have both  event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation(), while  $('a').click not ?
[15:48:25] <dabear> jankidudel: your question does not make any sense without some context. I can however tell you that .live uses event propagation to work
[15:49:21] <Zelest> how can I check whether a data is set? if ($('#foo').data('blah')) { ... } ?
[15:49:50] <danzik17> Zelest: see ?hasData

[15:55:08] <user444> any quick tip or any tutorial
[15:57:04] <intellilogic> Whats wrong with this:  $('#MultiRowTbl .1').find   I'm getting: a.nodeName is undefined  I googled and it suggested:  get(0).nodeName  var Section = $( '#MultiRowTbl .1' ).get(0).nodeName   Section.find...  Section.find is not a function
[16:08:55] <bitwise_> has anyone emulated the backstrech plugin with pure css?
[16:10:33] <Zelest> argh, how do you use .hasData() when it claims the object doesn't have the .hasData() method? o_O
[16:23:09] <brian_petersen> what's a good scrollbar jquery plugin? i've been having trouble with a lot of them! and i don't know what the problem is at all...
[16:31:25] <Whirl3d> What is a cdn that I can use for the latest jquery?
[16:32:15] <Whirl3d> not what is a cdn, rather, which cdn is what I meant to ask?
[16:32:29] <chilversc> Whirl3d: http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#CDN_Hosted_jQuery
[16:32:47] <Whirl3d> thank you
[16:32:57] <chilversc> looks like the standard google, microsoft and jquery's cdns carry it
[16:33:40] <Whirl3d> I was hoping to find one that automatically updated...you know with a url that pointed to the latest version--whatever version it is?
[16:33:43] <ridethefire122> any thoughts on how I would go about adding .fadeIn or .fadeTo to the following snippet? http://pastebin.com/572hde5t

[16:57:20] <amid_hasan> hi
[16:58:00] <amid_hasan> I'm trying to loop through an array key value, where key is an id and value is a url, and create a button for each item in the array. Any suggestions how to do this?
[17:03:18] <ipstatic> mp99
[17:04:03] <ipstatic> heh, excuse that paste, but I do have a question about jeditable if anyone can help
[17:06:58] <ipstatic> I am wanting to submit an extra parameter (the ID of the parent tag of the edit) but I am submitting to a function rather than to a URL
[17:07:10] <ipstatic> The problem is I do not see how to "access" this parameter
[17:08:37] <jrockjiggz> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/wRABC/
[17:10:17] <jrockjiggz> ipstatic: it tells u how here http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[17:11:58] <ipstatic> jrockjiggz:
[17:12:25] <ipstatic> jrockjiggz: I followed that but I get an undefined in the log when I try to look at the parent_id parameter: http://pastebin.com/Sewa4szN
[17:14:17] <kinesis> Can anyone give me ideas on how to get this to work: http://ocpro.com/uploader/
[17:14:43] <kinesis> it just says "Submitting..."
[17:14:58] <jrockjiggz> ipstatic: according to the documentation, the first paramater of the function should be your url, the second param should be an array with your custom values you want to pass
[17:16:07] <kinesis> http://ocpro.com/uploader/js/uploader.js
[17:16:28] <rogochin> [galleria plugin question]: anyone knows how i can "get" actual gallerias on the dom?
[17:17:54] <ipstatic> jrockjiggz: you can also submit to a function as well: "You can get full control of Ajax request. Just submit to function instead of URL. Parameters passed are same as with callback". The problem is I want to keep this all local without having to push to a server. I just need the parent ID of the editable object so that I can manipulate it after a save.
[17:18:01] <ipstatic> maybe I cannot do what I want to do with this plugin
[17:18:13] <jrockjiggz> ipstatic: try http://pastebin.com/KE8DDDPy ??
[17:18:28] <jrockjiggz> ohh i've never used this plugin before
[17:18:34] <ridethefire122> anyone?
[17:18:36] <ridethefire122> any thoughts on how I would go about adding .fadeIn or .fadeTo to the following snippet? http://pastebin.com/572hde5t
[17:19:13] <ipstatic> jrockjiggz: me either :)
[17:20:38] <ipstatic> jrockjiggz: that doesn't work as I do not have a form. I think this plugin wasn't designed for this so I may just develop my own. Thanks for your help
[17:37:54] <kinesis> Can anyone help me get this working? http://ocpro.com/uploader/

[17:47:34] <coldhead> like this maybe, ridethefire122 http://pastebin.com/8mPSBtQN
[17:48:14] <ridethefire122> let's find out\
[17:48:52] <coldhead> were you working on this earlier in the week with aj under a different nick?
[17:49:05] <ridethefire122> yeah
[17:49:09] <ridethefire122> new thing though
[17:49:12] <ridethefire122> well
[17:49:15] <ridethefire122> new part of it
[17:49:48] <ridethefire122> the actual player is complete, but I want to add a few effects to polish things off
[17:50:10] <coldhead> ah okay
[17:50:43] <ridethefire122> basically, I'm trying to fade out / in text on a click action
[17:51:05] <coldhead> yes, that's a very popular effect
[17:51:33] <ridethefire122> not surprising
[17:51:36] <ridethefire122> it'
[17:51:38] <ridethefire122> s p cool
[17:51:59] <ridethefire122> also
[17:52:07] <ridethefire122> what's with not using tabs in jquery?
[17:52:22] <coldhead> you can use tabs
[17:52:29] <coldhead> it's a matter for yourself
[17:52:57] <ridethefire122> oh, I know I can. it just seems like the preferred practice is to use a couple spaces instead
[17:54:37] <coldhead> i guess because jaavascript uses so many nested callbacks, and jQuery uses so many long chains, you can fit more with a few spaces indent
[17:54:51] <ridethefire122> fair enough
[17:55:11] <coldhead> http://pastebin.com/bHgMfTKR
[17:55:22] <coldhead> there's a version with fadeOut instead of hide()
[17:55:46] <ridethefire122> what is the practical difference between the two?
[17:56:37] <coldhead> the second uses a callback to only change the text and fadeIn once the fadeout has finished
[17:56:58] <coldhead> otherwise they'd happen simultaneously
[17:57:06] <coldhead> and cancel each other out pretty much
[17:57:40] <ridethefire122> oh no, I mean what is the practical difference bwtween using hide and fadeout
[17:57:50] <coldhead> hide isn't animated
[17:58:00] <coldhead> and you said "fade out fade in"
[17:58:06] <ridethefire122> fiar enough
[17:58:10] <ridethefire122> I was wondering that
[17:59:29] <ridethefire122> well, thanks for that. I was totally about to go in the wrong direction
[17:59:53] <coldhead> my pleasure
[18:00:39] <ridethefire122> this isn't "ajax," is it?
[18:00:46] <coldhead> no sir
[18:01:02] <coldhead> that's when you send data to/from the server without reloading the page
[18:01:10] <ridethefire122> oh ok
[18:01:15] <ridethefire122> I figured as much
[18:01:23] <ridethefire122> as is, all the date is currently on the page
[18:02:03] <coldhead> yes, the server could disappear and it wouldn't matter
[18:02:06] <coldhead> once the page has loaded
[18:02:17] <ridethefire122> hm
[18:02:24] <ridethefire122> guess I'll be getting into ajax next
[18:02:39] <ridethefire122> I'm looking to put together a streaming media playretr
[18:02:49] <coldhead> ambitious!
[18:03:27] <ridethefire122> maybe
[18:03:31] <ridethefire122> but it has to get done
[18:03:54] <coldhead> good luck!
[18:04:01] <ridethefire122> thanks mang
[18:08:45] <nexus6__> does .val() work with whitespaces in a string?
[18:09:10] <coldhead> it doesn't trim the whitepsace away

[19:15:09] <howardgrigg> where is says 1,0,9
[19:16:20] <jrockjiggz> well you could do something like $('#largeNumbersTable').text( value+' are your number')
[19:31:28] <thomedy> okay so what is your experience with firefox 4 and 5 because my site looked beautiful in 3 and crap in 4

[19:48:00] <Viper007Bond> if i have <div id="foo-bar-12345">, what's the best way to get that "12345"? just get the id using jquery and then parse the string? or is there some jquery magic i can use?
[19:48:25] <lduros> hello, trying to make my first plugin. so I've created my encapsulated plugin as in the plug authoring page. However, I'm wondering, if I create a function within the plugin like: function myFunct() { } how can I refer to the "this" of the instantiated plugin? like $('a.mytag').myPlugin(); within my private function I want to do stuff on $('a.mytag') but if I use "this" it doesn't work, while in the rest of the plugin it works. thanks
[19:50:26] <ner0x> Is it okay to put a <script> tag anywhere in the html?
[19:51:09] <Viper007Bond> ner0x: within reason, yes
[19:51:38] <lduros> ner0x: yes
[19:51:52] <ner0x> That works for me. Thanks.
[19:53:18] <Thomas`-> can anyone think of a way to add another background to a div with jquery?  (i have 1 set in css and want to use jquery to dynamically layer another one on top)
[19:54:14] <lduros> Thomas`-: I usually use :before using css mainly
[19:54:16] <lduros> like this:
[19:54:43] <lduros> div:before { width:100%; height:100%; content: " "; background:url(../images/something); }
[19:54:54] <lduros> you can use div:after also
[19:55:39] <lduros> you have to make sure the content in the div though have a z-index that is more than the div:before or div:after so that they are displayed on top of it
[19:55:48] <lduros> only issue is it doesn't work on IE7 and previous
[19:56:15] <lduros> another solution would be to use jquery and add an actual other div
[19:56:46] <lduros> with its background something in that div, and then use z-index to position it behind the other elements
[19:57:54] <Thomas`-> idoru, thank you for the ideas. i'll try now
[19:58:47] <Krinkle> Dantman: hey, here as well :)

[20:12:19] <zilly> Is there a way to remove a certain function binded to an element and then reattach it?
[20:15:32] <Viper007Bond> re: my earlier question: just ended up doing it manually: var itemID = parseInt(this.id.replace('foo-bar-', ''), 10);
[20:20:09] <SvcGhost> is it possible to use jquery or javascript to make an HTTP Request
[20:20:15] <SvcGhost> Similar to cURL
[20:21:52] <howardgrigg> what's the best way to simplify this http://pastie.org/2478973
[20:22:56] <lduros> SvcGhost: $.ajax()
[20:23:04] <lduros> that would make a request
[20:23:45] <lduros> SvcGhost: see here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:24:23] <SvcGhost> hmm
[20:25:22] <SvcGhost> I mean more like, can you use jQuery / JavaScript to make an HTTP request to get the HTML of a page given the URL, like cURL'
[20:25:54] <lduros> SvcGhost: you can get HTML content using $.ajax() I believe, it doesn't have to be jquery or json
[20:26:01] <lduros> to be json or xml
[20:26:02] <lduros>  i meant
[20:26:23] <lduros> SvcGhost: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[20:26:40] <lduros> SvcGhost: the example uses html content: $.get('ajax/test.html', function(data) {   $('.result').html(data);   alert('Load was performed.'); });
[20:27:08] <lduros> you see the url is test.html and the result is actually output as html within a container with the class result
[20:27:16] <lduros> you can load any page like this
[20:27:22] <lduros> into your own if you want to
[20:27:52] <lduros> but the problem is that
[20:27:59] <lduros> it has to be from the same domain
[20:28:05] <lduros> not any domain over the internet
[20:28:19] <lduros> you could use jsonp etc
[20:28:30] <lduros> to bypass cross domain restriction, but if it's just html you're stuck
[20:28:42] <SvcGhost> hmm
[20:28:46] <lduros> SvcGhost: if you wwant any url over the internet, then you might want to look into YQL
[20:28:52] <SvcGhost> Yeah, that's my problem, the cross domain
[20:28:59] <lduros> it's yahoo query language, they basically grab the content from a page
[20:29:01] <lduros> and return it to you
[20:29:03] <SvcGhost> Ah, okay, I'll look into YQL man thank you very much
[20:29:25] <SvcGhost> And Yahoo is basically acting like a proxy there?
[20:29:27] <lduros> SvcGhost: this is the tutorial you need: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-cross-domain-ajax-request-with-yql-and-jquery/
[20:29:35] <lduros> SvcGhost: yeh sort of
[20:29:50] <SvcGhost> Basically, if the Yahoo service is down, it won't work
[20:30:03] <lduros> SvcGhost: right
[20:30:12] <SvcGhost> Okay, thanks a lot man you're great
[20:30:16] <lduros> SvcGhost: they have said they would tell you 6 months ahead if they ever stop it
[20:30:23] <SvcGhost> kool kool
[20:30:32] <lduros> and they are also up 99.99% of the time ;-)
[20:30:34] <SvcGhost> Interesting that they do that and Google doesn't
[20:31:36] <lduros> yeh, another solution you can do is use jquery with $.ajax() to actually query a PHP page that uses CURL. That's what I'd do, but often it's not possible if php_curl isn't installed and remote fopen() is turned off as well.
[20:31:52] <SvcGhost> Yeah
[20:32:00] <SvcGhost> I see what you mean
[20:32:04] <SvcGhost> Thanks
[20:32:19] <lduros> yw
[21:05:40] <Thomas`-> is there any way i could expand everything inside a div at once to a certain percentage?
[21:14:52] <cook1es> Hi, I am showing an element when an user clicks another element, but I want the element to disappear when the user clicks elsewhere, I tried body:not(p) but that's not working. I'm thinking maybe I can run .click on *, and check what element is selected, and if it's p - show element, otherwise hide it. How do I check which element is selected?
[21:24:59] <cook1es> wtb morning person who knows how to check what element is selected <3
[21:28:49] <danzik17> cook1es: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/S9FHk/1/
[21:31:07] <cook1es> danzik17: no :(
[21:31:34] <cook1es> danzik17: it's abit more complicated than that, but do you know how to check what tag $(this) is?
[21:31:50] <cook1es> I tried $(this)->nodeName but I'm not superfamiliar with objects
[21:33:46] <danzik17> cook1es: Just use this.nodeName, no need to make a jQuery object for that
[21:37:04] <cook1es> danzik17: awesome thanks!
[21:48:45] <cook1es> Ok so I'm checking what element is clicked, but when I click P, I also recieve clicks for body and html. Anyone have an idea how to do it in a better way? :/
[21:55:20] <coldhead> ?stoppropagation @ cook1es
[21:55:20] <bot-t> cook1es, event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/

[22:00:24] <webguynow_> newbie ? here, a bit:  google CDN holds the latest copies of jQuery  for ex: you can pull latest  1.6.x  version with this
[22:00:34] <webguynow_> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6/jquery.min.js
[22:00:51] <webguynow_> but I need some jQuery UI libs
[22:01:02] <webguynow_> are these versioned  ?
[22:01:28] <webguynow_> does Google host them ?
[22:02:13] <jrockjiggz> webguynow_: http://web-profile.com.ua/jquery/jquery-cdn/
[22:02:34] <webguynow_> that might be best  if the browser cache can keep em accessible
[22:02:42] <coldhead> http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jqueryUI
[22:02:59] <webguynow_> core   widget  datepicker  is what I'm after
[22:03:49] <webguynow_> cool -  think I had read that previously, but had not been concerned with the UI part
[22:25:59] <webguynow_> what does the base ui theme  get you ?
[22:26:11] <webguynow_> Is it the default if you don't specify anything else ?
[22:27:18] <webguynow_> on the Demo I'm reviewing  it's using theme   'UI Lightness'   - is that base ?

[22:52:47] <Radek> Hi!
[22:54:04] <Radek> I try to find one simple answer for my problem but on the net it's quite hard, maybe here somebody know what to do..
[22:54:11] <Radek> if there is anybody...
[22:56:13] <Radek> my problem is that I retrive data via ajax, print it into dialog and run .buttonset() on one simple checkmark...
[22:56:36] <Radek> and all almost is ok, but this checkmark not works ..
[22:57:08] <Radek> it needs two times to click to really switch it on
[23:00:08] <Radek> first click looks like all is ok, classes are added to checkbox but value of checkbox is not changed so posting form sends wrong data (not switched on checkmark)
[23:11:55] <coldhead> ?p @ Radek
[23:11:55] <bot-t> Radek, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:12:12] <coldhead> if you can link to your code someone might be able to see the problem
[23:13:54] <Radek> okay, I try, thx for answ.

[23:22:57] <bot-t> .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[23:24:17] <coldhead> Perhaps true knowledge only comes of death by torture in the country of the mind.
[23:44:52] <jrockjiggz> is it possible to animate asynchroniously ?
