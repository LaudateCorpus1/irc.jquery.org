[00:31:21] <Derppy> I'm loading content with $.getJSON. I'm looping through it and generating a link for each item in the json file. Now I'd want to bind a click function to the links, which places content associated with it to certain places. I'm just having hard time trying to recognize which link belongs to which JSON item.
[00:31:50] <aavikkojootti> Derppy: u have to use live() or delegate()
[00:32:49] <aavikkojootti> i am not sure though does this solve your problem :(
[00:33:36] <JKarsrud> Derppy: couldn't you use some ID's and some data-attributes or data() to bind them together?
[00:34:02] <JKarsrud> having something like data-relation="someJSONitemsID"
[00:34:14] <JKarsrud> if I understand your problem correctly :)
[00:35:29] <{-_-\\\> hi
[00:35:43] <{-_-\\\> i have url like /dev.php/viesu_gramata/2
[00:35:53] <{-_-\\\> i need to select all <a> with href /dev.php/viesu_gramata
[00:35:56] <{-_-\\\> how can i do that?
[00:35:56] <Derppy> JKarsrud: Thanks, just what I needed.
[00:36:32] <coldhead> $('a[href*="/dev.php/viesu_gramata"]')
[00:36:42] <{-_-\\\> coldhead: this can't be hardcoded
[00:37:01] <{-_-\\\> the point is - when hash changes, i do $('a ...').click(); to load required page
[00:37:10] <{-_-\\\> but now there is also pagination
[00:37:27] <{-_-\\\> how can i find <a> by unpaginated current link?
[00:37:28] <JKarsrud> coldhead: u suck, you can't hardcode that stuff!

[00:41:53] <JKarsrud> dude, come on
[00:41:53] <{-_-\\\> ????
[00:41:57] <JKarsrud> read what I'm saying
[00:42:15] <JKarsrud> we're trying to give a solution where you don't have to include the last part of the url
[00:42:47] <JKarsrud> trying to think ahead for you, so that you don't have to hardcore /dev.php/viesu_gramata/2 /dev.php/viesu_gramata/3 /dev.php/viesu_gramata/4 everywhere
[00:43:09] <JKarsrud> a[href*="/dev.php/viesu_gramata"] will match /dev.php/viesu_gramata/2
[00:43:15] <{-_-\\\> omg
[00:43:22] <{-_-\\\> how can i find this /dev.php/viesu_gramata ?
[00:43:40] <JKarsrud> ?g attribute selectors
[00:43:42] <bot-t> JKarsrud, Selectors - http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html
[00:44:04] <{-_-\\\> http://www.trolls.lv/#/guestbook/ - works
[00:44:07] <{-_-\\\> http://www.trolls.lv/#/guestbook/2 - doesn't work
[00:44:12] <{-_-\\\> because there is /2 at the end
[00:44:22] <{-_-\\\> so i can't find the corresponding <a>
[00:44:57] <{-_-\\\> i can of course filter last part, but what if some link will have 2 parts, or 3?
[00:45:11] <coldhead> use flash?
[00:45:14] <{-_-\\\> LOL
[00:46:07] <{-_-\\\> so, once again - i need not to find /dev.php/viesu_gramata/2 by /dev.php/viesu_gramata
[00:46:10] <{-_-\\\> but /dev.php/viesu_gramata by /dev.php/viesu_gramata/2
[00:46:13] <{-_-\\\> how can i do it?
[00:46:25] <{-_-\\\> also it can be /dev.php/viesu_gramata/2/view/5 or stuff
[00:46:35] <{-_-\\\> i must still match /dev.php/viesu_gramata
[00:46:51] <xec> {-_-\\\: have you tried running around in circles? or perhaps jumping up and down?
[00:47:06] <{-_-\\\> xec: no.
[00:48:26] <{-_-\\\> ok then
[00:48:39] <{-_-\\\> is there php's strtok equivalent in javascript / jquery ?
[00:48:42] <coldhead> {-_-\\\: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[00:48:44] <coldhead> check those out
[00:48:49] <coldhead> there's the *= i showed you
[00:48:54] <coldhead> but also $= and ^=
[00:48:58] <coldhead> that match starts and ends
[00:49:16] <coldhead> you know what you need better than we do
[00:49:22] <{-_-\\\> <{-_-\\\> so, once again - i need not to find /dev.php/viesu_gramata/2 by /dev.php/viesu_gramata
[00:49:22] <{-_-\\\> <{-_-\\\> but /dev.php/viesu_gramata by /dev.php/viesu_gramata/2
[00:49:23] <coldhead> but i'm reminded of that ancient saying
[00:49:25] <{-_-\\\> can't you read?
[00:49:31] <{-_-\\\> =* works in opposite way i need
[00:49:32] <coldhead> set a man on fire and he'll be warm for the rest of his life
[00:49:34] <Clorith> Is there any way to make the jqueryui datepicker list months diagonally? I've tried restraining the container element with a width: css element, but the jqueryui element manually sets a style="width:" code
[00:50:08] <coldhead> {-_-\\\: clearly everyone is stupid except you, go read the docs and find what you need
[00:50:30] <Clorith> err, vertically even
[00:51:02] <Clorith> ooh, and now that I realised that the word I looked for was vertical, not diagonal, I got a google hit, haha
[00:51:05] <coldhead> i'm about to kick you, {-_-\\\
[00:51:08] <coldhead> but before i do
[00:51:46] <coldhead> $('a[href$="/dev.php/viesu_gramata"]') would match only stuff that ended in "gramata"
[00:51:53] <coldhead> it would NOT match the /2/ stuff
[00:52:11] <coldhead> * = anywhere, ^ = start, $ = end
[00:52:13] <coldhead> k?
[00:52:32] <coldhead> ahahha
[00:52:35] <tuxx-> lol @ hostname

[00:55:12] <DarsVaeda> hi, I have reload functions to display content in my page...like ie. displayCars(), displayBikes() - now I need to call those functions after a successful $.post, but that post is in chared code, so how do I tell him which function to use?
[00:55:41] <DarsVaeda> I mean I could do a switch with a parameter, but that's not cool somehow
[00:56:10] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda, have you tried attaching it as callback?
[00:56:25] <blackspotwiggins> make your "chared" code more flexible
[00:59:24] <DarsVaeda> yeah well...I'm a js/jquery noob
[00:59:57] <DarsVaeda> currently I am at using functions :/
[01:00:24] <tiffoknee1> when I target an input tag with a new value, 'change' events attahced to it dont fire and cascade. Is this expected behaviour or id domething hinky with my code?
[01:14:40] <manuel_> if i trigger/bind custom events, is it better to put additional information in the event object itself?
[01:14:46] <manuel_> or pass additional arguments to the function
[01:16:52] <DarsVaeda> blackspotwiggins: thanks, learned something and it works :)
[01:17:20] <blackspotwiggins> manuel_, depends on the use case. i've used both
[01:21:25] <KyouJin-SaMa> hello guys, i want to filter a select tag contents based on a previous select tag, how can i do that using jquery (ajax)?
[01:21:48] <KyouJin-SaMa> a state city sort of thing
[01:22:38] <KyouJin-SaMa> can someone point me to some reading material?
[01:24:05] <DarsVaeda> I'm not an expert but you can read about events in the docu
[01:24:25] <DarsVaeda> especially the changed event, also check the docu on forms, there is a "selected" selector
[01:32:04] <gnari> I have a page using jquery with a <embed> flash element. the flash element takes some time to finish drawing when page is loaded. how do I detect when flash is done? document.ready() seems to fire much sooner
[01:33:50] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, you cant in a trivial way
[01:34:11] <blackspotwiggins> prolly have to use as<->js interface from flash
[01:35:35] <aaronmcadam> that's not gnarf is it
[01:35:43] <gnari> no problem
[01:35:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:35:58] <aaronmcadam> is there one?
[01:36:07] <gnari> I guess a .load() handler wont work either
[01:36:20] <aaronmcadam> wouldn't make any difference
[01:36:28] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to fire an event from the actionscript
[01:36:36] <coldhead> gnarf can spell her own name >: |
[01:36:43] <aaronmcadam> it's a girl?
[01:36:49] <aaronmcadam> looks like a dude on twitter :O
[01:36:57] <coldhead> what makes you say that?
[01:36:59] <coldhead> the beard?

[01:37:17] <xkunalx> aaron dont get too excited
[01:37:27] <coldhead> that kind of nonchalance is the feminine in you that i crave, gnarf
[01:37:29] <xkunalx> she's probably got a beard

Please copy paste this to your editor so you get a better idea..
[01:40:23] <_phoe6> if I move .dialog( on a newline some lints complaint.

[01:41:57] <tolborg> noob question: I have a list of elements where each element has a id #something-1, #something-2 etc. How do I check if one of the elements has a "higher" id than the other? Whats the syntax

[01:42:56] <gnarf> tolborg: if you have control of the html
[01:43:03] <shellox_> hey guys, I created a button and set a onclick attribute for him, so onclick it removes one div. The problem is that on the first click nothing happens, but up the second click it works fine. I have no idea, why maybe you have an idea? jquery version is 1.6.2
[01:43:03] <tolborg> and let me add info: I want to hide every element which is of a higher id than the current clicked one
[01:43:05] <gnarf> you might want to do data-something="1" instead
[01:43:25] <tolborg> gnarl ahh yes.. I can name my own attributes?
[01:44:06] <gnarf> tolborg: surely there is a better way to find them tho
[01:44:21] <tolborg> perhaps I could traverse it
[01:44:21] <gnarf> tolborg: are they in order in the html in some shared parent container?
[01:44:26] <shellox_> the source code is here: https://gist.github.com/108aa0a1f5e2761bb6ce

[01:44:45] <gnarf> that might help
[01:44:48] <coldhead> comedy gold
[01:44:50] <tolborg> is there a traversing mechanism for saying … all elements after this one
[01:44:58] <tolborg> ahh
[01:44:59] <gnarf> if its all siblings
[01:44:59] <tolborg> thanks

[03:17:07] <speaker123> is it generally bad practice to store state information in the attributes of elements? even if it is removed at some later point?
[03:19:22] <blackspotwiggins> speaker123, somewhat - it depends on what you are doing
[03:19:39] <blackspotwiggins> checkbox checked state can only be stored in element attr/property
[03:20:06] <blackspotwiggins> if you are initializing data from data- style attributes, it's pretty reasonable as well

[04:32:43] <sean`> You shouldn't ahve any problems with that
[04:32:47] <sean`> have you triedi t in jsfiddle?
[04:33:15] <mattyh88> no, not yet
[04:43:34] <Trisox> how would i get the last item in this array ? [0,2,22,222]
[04:43:41] <Trisox> so 222
[04:44:16] <mattyh88> sean`: i'm a bit further .. doesn't show any errors anymore if i click an accordion header
[04:44:32] <mattyh88> just, all the content is showing now .. the closed items aren't hidden
[04:44:53] <zephir> hey guys
[04:44:54] <donCams> Trisox
[04:44:57] <Trisox> yea
[04:44:58] <donCams> array.length
[04:45:08] <zephir> is there a way to traverse xml that is saved to a variable?
[04:45:11] <Trisox> ahh
[04:45:18] <Trisox> your right..
[04:45:29] <donCams> var x = [0, 2, 22, 222]; x[x.length];
[04:45:39] <donCams> -1
[04:45:42] <donCams> sorry. heh
[04:45:47] <donCams> x[x.length-1]
[04:46:14] <Trisox> ;)
[04:50:44] <muzone_> At http://home.no/mritz/menu/ - why is my JS getting the width of #main_menu > li > ul (702px) all wrong?
[04:53:48] <donCams> muzone_, looks ok to me
[04:53:49] <Aamir> muzone_:  you cannot calculate the width or height which are hidden. Show them for a sec using .show(), get your width and height and than .hide() again
[04:54:04] <donCams> then again. i'm using chrome
[04:54:58] <muzone_> Aamir: will it flicker on the screen then?
[04:55:07] <muzone_> Aamir: it seems to be getting the height right though?
[04:55:37] <Aamir> muzone_:  seems to be ok. whats wrong?
[04:56:17] <muzone_> Aamir: the dropdown isnt centered, it's skewed over to the right
[04:56:27] <donCams> muzone_, update it when you show the menu
[04:56:34] <donCams> yeah. i see that on firefox
[04:57:14] <muzone_> works in chrome, true (but there the height is too short)
[04:57:48] <donCams> muzone_, height's also via jquery?
[04:57:53] <muzone_> donCams: how would i update it when i show the menu?
[04:57:57] <muzone_> donCams: yes
[04:58:00] <muzone_> also via jquery
[05:00:55] <donCams> that is odd :3
[05:01:17] <muzone_> ill give you a decent reward for helping me out, no doubt
[05:01:28] <muzone_> you too Aamir
[05:01:30] <donCams> muzone_, i reckon you are using .load to load the sub menu?
[05:01:39] <donCams> no need
[05:02:21] <muzone_> no, no load
[05:02:29] <Aamir> muzone_:  append the sub menu to the body and than reposition using this tech: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/210717/using-jquery-to-center-a-div-on-the-screen/210733#210733
[05:02:49] <muzone_> i got the js in the head so you can just view the source of the html
[05:03:48] <muzone_> Aamir: sorry, append it to the body?
[05:03:50] <tman> i have an swf is a container for an mp4 file, and am trying to call a js function which will fire a window.location when the video is finished... this is working using the video tag but ie doesn't support that and the flash fallback is the answer but for some reason i can't get the swf to communicate with the js function.. has anyone had experience with this?
[05:03:56] <Aamir> muzone_:  one sec
[05:04:30] <donCams> muzone_, load #main_menu li ul server-side then just set css to display:none;
[05:04:59] <donCams> on mouse over compute width, set margin, then show
[05:05:33] <donCams> limit javascript as much as possible
[05:07:52] <Aamir> muzone_:  any good http://jsfiddle.net/QdCaM/show/
[05:08:03] <mateus73> I'd like to implement "load" function with the 2 parameters (data, callback) using .live() .. how can I do that?
[05:08:27] <mateus73> $('.class').live('load', function () {})
[05:08:42] <Aamir> ahh its just firefox. in chrome its ok
[05:08:48] <mateus73> $('.class').live('load', {data:number}, function () {}) ?
[05:09:31] <mateus73> well 3 parameters actually .. file to load as well
[05:10:36] <donCams> mateus73, .live is to listen to events from generated(added) DOM elements.
[05:11:06] <muzone_> Aamir: sorry, no, still not centered
[05:11:14] <mateus73> don I don't understand how to use it to be honest
[05:11:15] <Aamir> muzone_:  wait
[05:11:50] <mateus73> $('.email-message').live('load', function () { what goes here? }
[05:11:58] <donCams> $('.newlink').live('click', function(){}); $('<a class="newlink"></a>').appendTo($('body'));
[05:12:09] <donCams> seee. newlink was recently added to the DOM
[05:14:23] <muzone_> <very> muzone, what about setting the left:50% AFTER setting the margin-left
[05:14:26] <muzone_> thanks very
[05:14:36] <muzone_> did that make any sense to you guys?
[05:14:58] <muzone_> very: still doesnt explain why its also getting the height wrong though
[05:15:29] <very> i thing maybe the width and height change when you set the margin-left
[05:15:40] <Trisox> donCams
[05:15:53] <muzone_> no, it got the height wrong before i added the margin-left js
[05:15:55] <Trisox> i used underscore .js
[05:16:04] <Trisox> saves looaaads of typing
[05:17:44] <very> okok, i thought you query the width/height and then setting margin-left to something negative, thus giving the element more horizontal space and so the width grows and the height shrinks
[05:19:08] <sledges> hello
[05:19:54] <very> but also strange is that you query the height of the container and set the height of its elements to this value. so the container gets even higher
[05:20:12] <sledges> could anyone help rewrite the code of http://www.emposha.com/javascript/fcbklistselection-like-facebook-friends-selector.html to support "live" elements? I.e.: I create the <li> items dynamically, too, from an ajax query. I tried substituting "children(" with "live('children', " but didn't work...
[05:22:14] <DukeDrake> hi
[05:22:42] <DukeDrake> I intend to code a simple carousel animation .
[05:23:11] <DukeDrake> But what are the basics? A div being a viewport, containing floating divs?
[05:33:15] <very> muzone, hey it really works, right?
[05:33:38] <muzone_> very: what does?
[05:34:03] <muzone_> very: im stuck at http://jsfiddle.net/QdCaM/show/ at the moment
[05:34:18] <very> when you set left:50% only after you alredy queried the width
[05:34:28] <very> it gets the width right
[05:35:36] <very> at least in my test
[05:36:54] <very> muzone, http://jsfiddle.net/very/RLQB9/show/
[05:39:03] <muzone_> very: i think you did it man..
[05:39:21] * muzone_ runs over to very and hugs him and shakes his hand repeatedly with a sick grin on his face
[05:39:40] * Akos imagines muzone_ as Spedey Gozanles
[05:42:26] * very shakes muzone_s hand.
[05:42:58] <muzone_> very: any idea why the height is inaccurate?
[05:43:01] <very> i just hope it works always.
[05:43:34] <very> also if the user changes the size of the window i guess everythings broken
[05:44:49] <Hackwar> hi folks, maybe someone can help me find a gallery script that takes a list of images, previews 4 of them on the one side and on click displays an image in big on the other side
[05:45:29] <muzone_> very: thats probably alright..
[05:49:29] <duke2> what would the best way be to feed a jquery plugin an event?
[05:50:02] <duke2> i want my plugin to receive certain click events
[05:50:55] <sean`> duke2, use 'trigger'
[05:51:43] <duke2> ok
[05:57:35] <Baribal> Hi. Does jQuery add classes automagically to elements with id="button"?
[05:57:58] <sean`> Not that I'm aware of
[05:58:07] <sean`> You can try and make a testcase and see for yourself.
[05:59:11] <tolborg> how do I check to see if an element is the last of its type (in a parent element) ?
[05:59:31] <dr0id> you could do that with css
[06:00:18] <aaronmcadam> is(':last-child') or something similar tolborg
[06:01:10] <tolborg> dr0id: yea, but I need it in an event
[06:01:22] <tolborg> aaronmcadam: cool that will work i guess
[06:01:22] <dr0id> ?last child
[06:01:25] <dr0id> ?last-child
[06:01:27] <aaronmcadam> give it a go
[06:01:31] <dr0id> ?diaf
[06:01:32] <aaronmcadam> ?tias
[06:01:39] <aaronmcadam> bot is asleep :(
[06:01:47] <dr0id> then why are we awake ? :O
[06:05:42] <mateus73> donCams, Is there a workaround to achieve same .live() function but for previous versions of jQuery ..
[06:06:10] <mateus73> donCams, I don't care if is a dirty thing .. it's justa presentation
[06:06:18] <dr0id> jquery 0.5 ?
[06:06:25] <aaronmcadam> liveQuery
[06:06:31] <aaronmcadam> mateus
[06:06:35] <mateus73> jquery 1.2.6
[06:06:39] <aaronmcadam> if u insist on using ancient shit
[06:06:40] <dr0id> I use livequery plugin \o/
[06:07:06] <aaronmcadam> the question really is why are you using something like 3 years old
[06:07:06] <mateus73> aaronmcadam oh it's just a presentation
[06:07:19] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[06:07:33] <aaronmcadam> do u mean prototype
[06:07:59] <mateus73> AaronDCampbell, There are a few plugin on a previous website .. I am not going to upgrade everything for just a presentation ... for designers
[06:08:13] <mateus73> AaronDCampbell, yes is just a prototype
[06:08:21] <aaronmcadam> haha
[06:08:35] <aaronmcadam> that dude's gonna come back and go "wtf?"
[06:08:54] <aaronmcadam> you really should be using something newer than a 3/4 year old library
[06:09:27] <aaronmcadam> ur app's probably due for a rewrite at this stage too
[06:10:30] <mateus73> aaronmcadam well that's for sure
[06:16:38] <mateus73> Hey guys .. can I run 2 versions of jQuery?
[06:18:28] <sean`> mateus73, you can even run 50
[06:18:39] <sean`> mateus73, api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict
[06:19:10] <mateus73> sean cool thanks
[06:29:54] <alabd> Good day all , have used this http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3629 but year is 2011 yet , do you know why ?
[06:30:14] <mateus73> sean I get error message saying jQuery is not defined
[06:30:36] <mateus73> var $jq = jQuery.noConflict();
[06:30:50] <mateus73> above there's jquery 1.4.3
[06:31:01] <mateus73> below there's 1.2.6
[06:32:01] <kborchers> mateus73: why do you need 2 versions? and 2 old versions at that?
[06:32:24] <mateus73> kborchers, it's just a quick prototype
[06:33:55] <kborchers> mateus73: ok, that doesn't answer either of my questions though. you should not need 2 versions of jQuery. if you have some old busted plugin that requires old jQuery, get a new one
[06:36:53] <mateus73> kborchers, it's not easy doing that
[06:37:03] <mateus73> And it's really just a prototype
[06:37:29] <mateus73> Having 2 versions of jquery looks the easier and quicker way
[06:37:31] <donCams> please use an updated version of jquery
[06:38:02] <donCams> as it has fixed the bugs in the previous versions especially security stuff
[06:38:04] <mateus73> donCams, I'll do it .. but I am not doing it now
[06:38:27] <donCams> if you can do it now, why do it later? :3
[06:38:46] <mateus73> donCams, it is far to be a production thing
[06:40:17] <kborchers> mateus73: my point though is even if this is not for production but may be some day, why go through the headache of making it work with two old versions of jQuery rather than doing the work to make it work with the single latest version.
[06:40:19] <donCams> http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prototype
[06:43:46] <alabd>  What is license if files that are downloadable here http://jqueryui.com/download , are they free(libre) ?
[06:44:46] <djQuery> alabd: yes jquery.ui is open source \ free
[06:45:13] <alabd> djQuery: where is this written ?
[06:45:18] <djQuery> alabd: think it has the same license as jquery
[06:45:40] <alabd> think is not adequit
[06:45:45] <alabd> should be sure
[06:45:52] <kborchers> yes, same license as jQuery "Dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses. http://jquery.org/license"
[06:46:35] <Thomas`-> is there any function that can return a boolean value if the mouse is currenly over a given element?
[06:48:11] <alabd> kborchers: how did you find out their license is the same as jquery ?
[06:48:29] <erichynds> alabd: look in the header of the js file
[06:48:38] <erichynds> it's in there
[06:50:20] <kborchers> alabd: see erichynds response. i quoted that from the header of the js file
[06:50:42] <djQuery> alabd: also I believe when you download it copies of the license go with it. download it and look in the developement-bundle folder
[06:52:03] <alabd> their lisence is witten in .js file thanks
[06:54:48] <sledges> how can I get elem.children() returning dynamically created ones?
[06:57:11] <mateus73> Ok .. works great with 2 versions
[06:57:18] <mateus73> Thanks guys
[07:00:12] <burg> hello. how can i find what position does one element have among its siblings? like $(elem).something() to return n if there are n siblings before that element
[07:00:14] <garbagegod> why cant i make any of my timer functions work :(
[07:02:55] <kborchers> ?index @ burg

[07:03:18] <burg> thanks
[07:09:45] <SkiOne> Hi does anyone use the chrome developer tools to debug ajax requests? I noticed a change in chrome's behavior and I don't get how to use it to debug now
[07:10:16] <SkiOne> or if there is a better IRC chat room to talk about this, please tell me
[07:10:48] <Deneme> s.a.
[07:11:03] <Deneme> Türk var mı kanalda ?
[07:12:10] <kapowaz> is there any equivalent to event.stopPropagation() for preventing event *capturing* ?
[07:12:32] <x3rames> hey there… I wrote a _very_ short jquery plugin, and I am wondering if I should release it or something… The use of the plugin is to not loose the original "this"-context of a callback, when passing it to a jQuery function -> http://pastie.org/2497327
[07:12:34] <kapowaz> I know stopPropagation() prevents bubbling, but is there one to stop events continuing through to the children elements?
[07:12:42] <misterm> SkiOne: what change? generally it should be there in the network tab
[07:12:48] <xec> return false;?
[07:13:01] <kapowaz> xec: d'oh!
[07:13:03] <kapowaz> of course.
[07:13:21] <xec> :)
[07:14:33] <xec> kapowaz: there's also event.stopPropagation();
[07:15:34] <xec> err preventDefault
[07:15:47] <SkiOne> misterm: I used to use the console to view when an Ajax request completes. Then I would click the link and it would show me the output of the request. Now it doesn't
[07:16:22] <SkiOne> misterm: I see it now, thanks but that seems less intuitive than before
[07:18:21] <kapowaz> yeah, I've used preventDefault before — this is a custom event handler though so there isn't any default.
[07:29:07] <JAAulde> Morning all.  Using jQuery, how can I append something like the return of `$( '<nodeone />' )` to a jQuery instance which represents a document other than the browser's window.document (working with XML here)
[07:29:46] <JAAulde> I am running into issues with the jQuery-esque syntax as it does not check that the elements belong to the same document and attempt to import when they're not
[07:30:05] <JAAulde> I can grab the actual element and use DOM methods if needed, but wanted to check if there was a jQ way to do it
[07:34:11] <Illusioneer> I have a problem with tache (the caching plugin), where it will only take a file.  Can I have it cache something more dynamic like a json my model controller (in php) outputs?
[07:43:59] <djQuery> ?tache
[07:51:55] <djQuery> Illusioneer: well seeing how the great wealth of documentation on the site http://joncom.be/code/jquery-tache/  hope you finger it out.
[07:52:08] * djQuery sarcasm off
[07:53:44] <Illusioneer> djQquery: you mean that one page?
[07:53:48] <djQuery> yes
[07:54:09] <djQuery> the sarcasm was dealing with the documentation
[07:54:32] <Illusioneer> ah
[07:54:38] <Illusioneer> hard to tell sometimes :P
[07:54:54] <Illusioneer> yeah I'm starting to think this is going to require coding an extra action just for it
[07:55:17] <djQuery> should have wrapped it in <sarcasm> tags
[07:55:36] <SURFkees> Hey, I'm trying to make the $.ajax success callback function return the data to the parent. How can I do this? http://pastebin.com/iXhey4bg

[07:55:44] <overrider> i am dynamically adding rows to a table, each row then has a: <input name='line_items[itemID][price]' />. How can i select that itemID inside the input in order to change its value to something unique?
[07:56:22] <djQuery> SURFkees: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[07:56:38] <Illusioneer> djQuery, yes it helps my internal compiler, otherwise you'll give me a context error
[07:56:48] <overrider> ah ok, just using val();
[07:56:54] <kkuno> hi
[07:57:08] <kkuno> if I have this code
[07:57:20] <kkuno> nope, I just ansered by myself
[07:57:21] <kkuno> np
[07:57:25] <kkuno> answered
[07:58:48] <djQuery> kkuno: fix most of my issues by trying to working it into a Q
[07:59:14] <kkuno> O_o
[08:00:04] <djQuery> kkuno: and like that last sentence most of my issues come from having 2 thoughts leak into code at the same time
[08:00:44] <kkuno> :P
[08:02:50] <jebaird> overrider: you can select the last row in the table and get the input get the name and parse it out
[08:08:40] <connex> hi, why doesn
[08:10:54] <connex> hi, why doesn't the added li remove them-self on click ? http://pastebin.com/xXVF35xR
[08:12:58] <kborchers> connex: check out http://api.jquery.com/live/ and http://api.jquery.com/delegate your li's don't exist when you try to bind the click handler
[08:13:28] <pwf> so i'm getting a '$ is undefined' error, but jQuery IS defined at the same point in the code... what gives
[08:13:42] <gebbione> hi all, i m trying to use alert($('#fileTxt').files.size);
[08:13:46] <pwf> it's even inside my $(document).ready() function
[08:13:47] <connex> kborchers, thank you very much
[08:14:05] <gebbione> but it is not working for me, where can i find a reference in the API on how to use the files property?
[08:15:08] <gebbione> i am trying to check the file size before a file is sent to the server?
[08:16:28] <kborchers> gebbione: the file information is not available client side (without nasty ActiveXObjects or something) for security. you can't do that
[08:16:48] <gebbione> :/
[08:18:59] <gebbione> kborchers is this page a fake? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1601455/check-file-input-size-with-jquery
[08:19:33] <gebbione> it says i should be able to check the size using this approach but it aint working for me
[08:20:12] <JAAulde> I am building an interface, the interaction with which causes changes to an XML document. I am using jQuery to manipulate the XML document, and was doing great until I needed to add new element to it. Is there a known way to use jQuery to add elements to a DOM document other than window.document? Everything I try seems to choke on the new nodes not being imported to the document properly (since jQ is operating in context of window.document wh
[08:20:12] <JAAulde> en creating nodes)
[08:20:20] <kapowaz> I'm working on a series of site components which make extensive use of custom JS events, and I was wondering if there is a well-documented ‘best practice’ for this kind of thing? I'm binding lots of event handlers to $(document), using deep scope, so as to allow multiple components to trigger events for each other without risk of the component not actually being registered/present. Any thoughts on this?
[08:22:06] <Eviltwin> kapowaz: You could still run the risk of an listener not being bound in time to catch an important event
[08:24:40] <kapowaz> surely that's only if the events themselves get triggered before all bindings are complete?
[08:24:49] <Cedrus> I've got a strange issue with jQuery.ParseXML. It won't successfully return the text within my summary element http://pastebin.com/2ZPUwQCJ
[08:25:28] <ajpiano> kapowaz: that pattern is known as publish/subscribe
[08:25:38] <kapowaz> so it is an existing pattern
[08:25:41] <kapowaz> I had a feeling it might be
[08:25:54] <aaronmcadam> or the observer pattern
[08:26:18] <kapowaz> aha, I have heard *of* the observer pattern, but never actually looked into it.
[08:26:27] <aaronmcadam> kapowaz: https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
[08:26:34] <aaronmcadam> I use that plugin
[08:26:38] <aaronmcadam> very simple
[08:28:05] <kborchers> gebbione: that solution is barely usable. i have tested and it only works in Chrome and Safari for me. Not in IE9 nor Firefox. You might as well just check server side since you would have to do that for those browsers anyway
[08:28:29] <kapowaz> interesting, although I'm uncertain why you'd need any extra JS to handle it, given the affordances with jQuery's bind/trigger mechanics?
[08:29:01] <ajpiano> kapowaz: there's a lot of "overhead" to do it that way
[08:29:03] <aaronmcadam> kapowaz: pubsub doesn't touch the dom at all
[08:29:03] <ajpiano> http://weblog.bocoup.com/publishsubscribe-with-jquery-custom-events
[08:29:16] <aaronmcadam> it's simple functional js
[08:29:31] <aaronmcadam> custom events do
[08:30:08] <kapowaz> overhead in performance terms, or code complexity terms?
[08:31:24] <ajpiano> both
[08:31:55] * kapowaz nods
[08:31:56] <aaronmcadam> jquery.pubsub is so easy to use
[08:31:59] <Cedrus> Can anyone submit a trac ticket for me?
[08:32:04] <Cedrus> It just tells me that mine are spam
[08:32:12] <aaronmcadam> just read the source kapowaz, there's more commenting than code in it
[08:32:31] <kapowaz> I'd have to imagine so... it's not like the stuff I've done is massively complex :)
[08:32:58] <ajpiano> Cedrus: why is it tellling you that
[08:32:59] <aaronmcadam> it's complex enough that you want to decouple it ;)
[08:33:07] <kurisu> I'm using a js wp plugin that converts .mp3 links into playable sm2 links.. it works fine but then I'm using js & ajax to pull in more links onto the page... the new links do not get converted... is it possible to re-call the plugins js from within my js/ajax call (fooling it into thinking the page has reloaded)
[08:33:27] <aavikkojootti> where you convert them?
[08:33:32] <Cedrus> ajpiana: Akismet thinks your submission is spam
[08:33:48] <aaronmcadam> you can fool the page? :O
[08:33:48] <aavikkojootti> kurisu: checkout the live() function
[08:33:53] <aaronmcadam> or the browser?
[08:33:58] <ajpiano> Cedrus: do you have an abundance of links in your ticket
[08:34:07] <Cedrus> One.
[08:34:22] <aaronmcadam> s/live/delegate kurisu
[08:34:30] <Cedrus> Ugh, it seems to have submitted now
[08:34:34] <ajpiano> Cedrus: that is bizarre
[08:34:35] <ajpiano> ah ok
[08:35:39] <kurisu> I'll look into it, thanks
[08:36:23] <kapowaz> kurisu: I'm not sure delegate is what you need, if I understand correctly
[08:36:37] <kapowaz> you're talking about DOM content that you want to manipulate, but that is loaded asynchronously?
[08:36:53] <kapowaz> manipulate rather than have event bindings attached to?
[08:37:22] <kurisu> yeah
[08:38:21] <kapowaz> I'm not sure if there's any nice way of doing this automatically in jQuery, but whenever I've had to do this in the past I've just split out the manipulation stuff into an appropriate function, called both on document ready and post-asynchronous call
[08:38:46] <kapowaz> so whenever you load content (be that normally or via ajax) you have to then call said function to do your manipulation too
[08:39:13] <pwf> how can jQuery be defined but $ is undefined...
[08:39:54] <kurisu> ahhh, I was hoping there would be a nice way... guess I'll just have to rewrite the plugins code and split it up... thanks
[08:40:33] <kapowaz> shouldn't be too hard to write a simple method that does what you want to links, abstracting out that part, then call it from a couple of different places.
[08:41:01] <Eviltwin> pwf: jQuery.noConflict()
[08:41:06] <Eviltwin> ? $.noConflict
[08:41:07] <kurisu> hopefully... fairly new to js so I guess I'll see
[08:41:13] <Eviltwin> Err, I don't remember the syntax
[08:41:40] <kurisu> whats the best way to call a function from another js file?
[08:42:06] <Eviltwin> Uh...they're all in the same global namespace
[08:42:17] <pwf> $.noConflict is so other things can use $
[08:42:22] <pwf> none of my scripts are trying to though
[08:42:32] <pwf> i just have jquery ui and a datatables plugin
[08:42:52] <Eviltwin> pwf: $.noConflict is usually the only thing that makes jQuery exist but not $
[08:43:08] <Eviltwin> Unless elsewhere in your code you've gone and set window.$ or done var $ = something;
[08:43:24] <pwf> jQuery.noConflict();  //jQuery Translate plugin and related components
[08:43:26] <pwf> argh
[08:43:28] <pwf> thank you :)
[08:47:17] <kkuno> is it possible to monitor in someway when the scrollbars are toggled?
[08:47:38] <levifig> why is this variable undefined: "var $other = $('input[name^=otherAmt]').attr('value');"??
[08:47:40] <levifig> :(
[08:48:09] <Eviltwin> Is $('input[name^=otherAmt]') defined?
[08:48:14] <Eviltwin> Non-empty
[08:48:39] <kkuno> because scrollbars are not seen like a $(window).resize()
[08:48:52] <kborchers> levifig: try $('input[name^="otherAmt"]').attr('value'); //notice added quotes around otherAmt
[08:49:06] <levifig> Eviltwin, it is
[08:49:08] <riyonuk> I'm sitting here trying to learn jQuery, and I just feel I don't have the right tools. I'm sure there is a better way to learn, then writing in notepad, and refreshing the page. Is there a tutorial on doing it from the console using the chrome web developer tools?
[08:49:13] <kkuno> but the window is actually resized
[08:49:15] <levifig> if I load it up in the console it returns a value
[08:49:21] <levifig> I'll check kborchers tip
[08:49:44] <kborchers> levifig: also, you can just do .val() instead of .attr('value')
[08:50:00] <levifig> kborchers, I am using that already… copy+pasted the old code :p
[08:50:02] <levifig> thanks :)
[08:50:44] <aaronmcadam> levifig: also, use .val()
[08:50:54] <aaronmcadam> ah
[08:51:15] <aaronmcadam> ur selector is probably wrong then
[08:51:29] <levifig> look
[08:51:30] <levifig> http://rad.st/9viQ
[08:51:35] <levifig> (screenshot from the console)
[08:51:37] <levifig> :|
[08:54:18] <Moslim> Hi every body , i look for the right way to get the path of file selected by "<input tupe= "file"..">   into  a div using jquery function Thanks
[08:55:03] <bensmoif> hey guys I have what I thought was a really simple question about $.ajax status codes
[08:55:20] <bensmoif> the second param for a success or complete call
[08:55:25] <bensmoif> i think it's second on error as well
[08:55:27] <bensmoif> is:
[08:55:29] <bensmoif> status - contains the status of the request ("success", "notmodified", "error", "timeout", or "parsererror")
[08:55:45] <bensmoif> how does jquery decide which of those it is?
[08:56:06] <bensmoif> by http status code?
[08:57:25] <bensmoif> yeah it looks like error's status text is "timeout", "error", "abort", and "parsererror"
[08:57:37] <bensmoif> so, what defines a success timeout
[08:57:46] <bensmoif> and how does that differ from an error timeout
[08:59:23] <levifig> anyone got any hints on why I can't seem to specify variables? :(
[08:59:50] <bensmoif> whats that mean levifig?
[08:59:59] <bensmoif> var fart = "fart";
[09:02:10] <levifig> "undefined"
[09:02:20] <levifig> every. stinking. time.
[09:02:22] <levifig> :|
[09:02:26] <levifig> what am I missing here?
[09:03:12] <levifig> interesting
[09:03:23] <levifig> var $fart = "fart" -> undefined
[09:03:31] <Eviltwin> Duh
[09:03:36] <levifig> $fart = "fart" -> "fart"
[09:03:41] <Eviltwin> The expression itself is undefined
[09:03:44] <Eviltwin> A var expression
[09:03:56] <Eviltwin> (var x = ...) === undefined
[09:04:07] <Eviltwin> (x = ...) === new value of x
[09:06:38] <levifig> hmm
[09:06:46] <levifig> Eviltwin, *hug*
[09:06:47] <levifig> :)
[09:07:13] <levifig> basically I don't need to declare variables before using them right?
[09:08:57] <FuzzyNuts> Right, I have a shoutbox made in jQuery/PHP, is there a way of making it show a constant stream of data instead of having to refresh it to see latest messages?
[09:09:57] <Eviltwin> levifig: Um...yeah?
[09:10:05] <Eviltwin> levifig: Let me see some code. Whar are you trying to do?
[09:10:16] <Eviltwin> What*
[09:10:22] <Eviltwin> Use pastebin or jsfiddle
[09:11:43] <levifig> Eviltwin, http://pastie.org/private/va5uhu7fmeodirbaoxpta
[09:12:14] <levifig> gotta fix that addition
[09:12:15] <levifig> :|
[09:12:18] <levifig> it's appending
[09:12:25] <levifig> not adding arithmetically
[09:12:28] <Eviltwin> levifig: Just var them at whatever level you want
[09:12:34] <aaronmcadam> FuzzyNuts: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[09:12:46] <levifig> Eviltwin, it's working now, without the "var"
[09:12:46] <Eviltwin> levifig: Use parseFloat
[09:12:48] <aaronmcadam> try that FuzzyNuts, a better setTimeout will do your job
[09:12:54] <Eviltwin> Where was the var?
[09:13:05] <levifig> before every variable I'm defining
[09:13:16] <levifig> e.g. var $total = 0;
[09:13:18] <Eviltwin> Can I see how it was?
[09:13:25] <tonyjcamp> Can anyone tell me what the first semi-colon in this pattern is for?  ;(function() { })();  I've seen mr ajpiano use it, but I don't know what it's for. Google no helpy :(
[09:14:01] <ajpiano> tonyjcamp: it's so that if you're using a build tool to concat js files
[09:14:07] <Eviltwin> Exactly
[09:14:13] <aaronmcadam> also stops any other code messin urs up
[09:14:22] <tonyjcamp> Ah rad, thanks.
[09:14:23] <ajpiano> yup
[09:14:45] <tonyjcamp> I saw it last night at like 2 am your time, and it's been eating at me since this morning.
[09:14:52] <levifig> Eviltwin, http://pastie.org/private/mnvg5hkue3lcibbvcrg (old, non working)
[09:14:53] <tonyjcamp> Thanks dudes.
[09:15:29] <Eviltwin> levifig: That wasn't working?
[09:15:34] <levifig> nop
[09:15:36] <Eviltwin> You sure you didn't have any other vars in there?
[09:15:40] <levifig> undefined left in right
[09:15:43] <levifig> :\
[09:16:15] <Eviltwin> How did you determine theree were undefineds left and right?
[09:18:00] <levifig> console
[09:18:15] <Eviltwin> levifig: These vars are in a sub scope
[09:18:27] <levifig> ya, but I'd try redefining them
[09:18:32] <Eviltwin> That's what happens when you wrap something in a function
[09:18:40] <levifig> agree
[09:18:55] <Eviltwin> You don't have any way to access them unless you set a breakpoint inside
[09:19:01] <Eviltwin> And hit that
[09:19:09] <levifig> hmmm
[09:19:15] <levifig> I might've screwed something up then
[09:19:23] <levifig> that second code paste I sent ya is working
[09:19:24] <levifig> lol
[09:19:24] <levifig> :p
[09:19:35] <Eviltwin> By leaving off the var's you're putting everything in global scope
[09:19:40] <levifig> Eviltwin, now I just need to figure out how to do the addition
[09:19:54] <Eviltwin> Try using parseFloat
[09:19:56] <levifig> it's appending the value of $other
[09:20:05] <Eviltwin> "1.0"+"2.0" = "1.02.0"
[09:20:14] <Eviltwin> parseFloat("1.0")+parseFloat("2.0") = 3.0
[09:20:14] <levifig> ohh
[09:20:15] <levifig> duh
[09:20:17] <levifig> :|
[09:20:19] <levifig> thanks
[09:20:20] <levifig> haha
[09:20:44] <levifig> multiplication works so I completely forgot about that :)
[09:29:30] <Moslim> please some one can tell me how to get the path of uploadfile with jquery ?
[09:29:59] <johnline3> wat?
[09:30:47] <BoulderDave> does anyone have a good work around for .blur() in Chrome?  (it isn't supported)
[09:31:59] <Moslim> get a path selected by uploadfile !
[09:32:15] <Eviltwin> Not possible in all browsers, sorry
[09:32:33] <Rushing> BoulderDave, maybe you could trigger focus() on something else?
[09:32:55] <Moslim> 1-click on UploadFile  2-select path 3-get the path value with jquery
[09:33:03] <Moslim> how i can process number 3 ?
[09:33:47] <tiofred> Hi guys. I have on my page a div (class fadehover) containing a png img. Under that div (hidden by the other), I have a div with a png img too. I have some js code ->http://jsfiddle.net/9AKna/ that fades the above div so the under div can be seen. But now I have to find a way to have the under div to be hidden ar first, and to "unfade" when the above fades. Any idea guys ?
[09:33:51] <Eviltwin> Moslim: No. Can. Do.
[09:34:16] <Moslim> Eviltwin !
[09:34:20] <Moslim> Okey
[09:34:35] <BoulderDave> Rushing, I have a link that when clicked, opens a div (a drop down list).  I would need to focus on anything other than the div...  it should close if the user clicks any where on the screen outside of the div...  ideas?
[09:35:12] <donCams> <?php echo $path; ?> get that with $.ajax :)
[09:35:31] <BoulderDave> I could do a .focus() on body perhaps.. and if the div is focused, dont close?
[09:36:11] <donCams> BoulderDave, .hover
[09:37:08] <BoulderDave> donCams, are you meaning to use it to determine if the mouse is hovering over the div when its clicked?
[09:37:19] <donCams> yeah
[09:37:59] <BoulderDave> donCams, thanks, i'll try that too.. can also try  .is(":focus")  yea?
[09:38:38] <Xeon06_> Hey all
[09:38:56] <Xeon06_> Does anyone know how to refresh a jQuery mobile input after a theme change?
[09:39:21] <donCams> thing is. if the user just clicks the button and does nothing else after that, you can also set a delay to hide the dropdown div back. but that's just me :3
[09:40:09] <donCams> or you can just .toggle
[09:43:32] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[09:44:23] <Shwaiil> Q: How to change the height of the parent iFrame ? Let's say we're in the page that was set in <iframe src="URL_HERE<<THIS_PAGE">. Thanks for looking! Any tip is appreciated! ;D
[09:45:27] <wookiehangover> Shwaiil: is the iframe on the same domain?
[09:45:48] <wookiehangover> cause if its not, you need to have access to whatever's loading in your iframe
[09:45:59] <Shwaiil> found something $("#frameId").height($("#frameId").contents().find("html").height());
[09:46:03] <wookiehangover> and then use html5 postMessage to talk back and forth
[09:46:08] <Shwaiil> wookiehangover, tks for looking. Yeah on same domani
[09:46:10] <wookiehangover> that will only work for same domain
[09:46:18] <wookiehangover> ya you're good then
[09:46:27] <Shwaiil> tks
[09:47:39] <tiofred> Hi guys. I have on my page a div (class fadehover) containing a png img. Under that div (hidden by the other), I have a div with a png img too. I have some js code ->http://jsfiddle.net/9AKna/ that fades the above div so the under div can be seen. But now I have to find a way to have the under div to be hidden ar first, and to "unfade" when the above fades. Any idea guys ?
[09:50:04] <Eviltwin> tiofred: $(function(){$(".theOneThatsUnderFadeHover").fadeout()});
[09:50:49] <tiofred> Eviltwin: thanks, gonna try that. But should I set it to visibility: hidden in the css before ?
[09:51:57] <Eviltwin> I would do .fadeOut(0);
[09:52:09] <Eviltwin> So it is basically immediately faded out on load
[09:52:47] <donCams> .hide()
[09:53:58] <tiofred> Eviltwin: i'm testing this thanks
[09:55:37] <donCams> tiofred; $('#abovediv').fadeOut(0, function() { $('#underdiv').fadeIn('slow') });
[09:57:37] <tiofred> donCams:  are you embedding one function in another ?
[09:58:11] <levifig> how do I do an "OR" with javascript selectors?
[09:58:28] <levifig> I wanna do $('select').change() and $('input').keyup
[09:58:40] <levifig> when EITHER happen, I want to run a function
[09:58:47] <PrgmrBill> use a comma
[09:59:10] <levifig> PrgmrBill,  where? :)
[09:59:22] <levifig> $('select, input') ?
[09:59:29] <Eviltwin> levifig: function x(){...};$('select').change(x);$('input').keyup('x')
[09:59:30] <PrgmrBill> yeha but I guess that doesn't cover different events
[09:59:31] <muzone_> How'd I go about creating an image rotator (with forth and back arrow buttons) like on http://www.tobi.com? I'd rather not use any of those enormous plugins packed with stuff I don't need, like the ones at http://www.queness.com/post/3036/create-a-custom-jquery-image-gallery-with-jcarousel
[09:59:47] <levifig> Eviltwin, bingo :) thanks
[10:00:04] <Eviltwin> Err
[10:00:05] <tiofred> donCams , Eviltwin: both solutions end up with blinking
[10:00:13] <Eviltwin> $('input').keyup(x)
[10:00:31] <Brodingo> muzone_ cycle lite
[10:00:50] <tiofred> and I have the below div set in css as display: none;
[10:01:04] <muzone_> Brodingo: looks decent! thanks man
[10:01:12] <Eviltwin> I think fadeOut uses opacity
[10:01:38] <Brodingo> no prob
[10:02:08] <donCams> muzone_: $('ul').animate({'margin-left': '+/-' + $('li').width() + 'px'});
[10:03:04] <donCams> tiofred, jsfiddle
[10:03:11] <tiofred> Eviltwin: I've set the below css opacity to 0; and I do what donCams wrote, and the opposite on unhover
[10:03:29] <tiofred> donCams:  oki
[10:04:01] <muzone_> donCams: you sure that one line can act as a proper image rotator?
[10:04:09] <draginx> Is there a way to trigger a select to drop down?
[10:04:16] <muzone_> Brodingo: what you think?
[10:04:24] <donCams> it doesn't rotate, just slides
[10:04:44] <donCams> you can then clone the ul li's once you reach the end
[10:04:56] <donCams> something like that
[10:05:27] <muzone_> nice.. pretty cool
[10:07:13] <Michael> draginx: Not really
[10:07:23] <Michael> draginx: You'd have to position it absolute, change it to multi and change the height
[10:07:29] <draginx> right
[10:07:30] <draginx> ok thanks :)
[10:07:32] <Michael> np
[10:08:57] <tiofred> donCams, Eviltwin : http://jsfiddle.net/9AKna/1/ I've used the div ids because I don't know yet how to point to another div, like  "this" is the div "society" and I'd like to do something on the div "this" + "on" -> "society_on"
[10:10:24] <donCams> muzone_ http://jqueryfordesigners.com/jquery-infinite-carousel/
[10:10:51] <donCams> ugly though coz it has some blanks. but would work if you are displaying single large images
[10:31:03] <enjoycrf> wth
[10:32:43] <lduros> hello, I'm looking for a jquery plugin with the correct code style and best  practice to learn from. I have read the JQuery Core Style Guidelines and applying more or less of it, but thought someone might have a plugin to recommend I could look at
[10:32:44] <lduros> thanks
[10:34:32] <danzik17> lduros: How about the jQuery source itself?
[10:34:43] <lduros> danzik17: it's not exactly a jquery plugin though
[10:35:05] <lduros> danzik17: but that's what i've been looking at so far
[10:35:20] <erichynds> lduros: anything @ benalman.com
[10:35:28] <danzik17> lduros: True enough.  If I was doing it, I'd go look at one of the jqueryui plugin's sources
[10:35:53] <ajpiano> lduros: https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[10:35:57] <danzik17> lduros: (Assuming that's the kinda plugin you wanted)
[10:35:57] <lduros> danzik17: sounds good. thanks.
[10:36:05] <lduros> erichynds: ajpiano: will looks at those, thanks :-)
[10:38:46] <lduros> ajpiano: how come in your js jquery.basic.plugin-boilerplate.js there's no space between non-empty parentheses, like:  function Plugin(element, options) -- the core style guidelines show spaces for these
[10:39:42] <ajpiano> because i put that together as a favour to send someone in an e-mail at 1:30 in the morning
[10:39:59] <lduros> ajpiano: ok, so do you usually put spaces there?
[10:40:09] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:40:18] <lduros> ajpiano: ok sounds good. was just curious :-)
[10:41:25] <jmp909> hi
[10:42:05] <muzone_> What's the best online JS minifier?
[10:42:24] <jmp909> does anyone have IE8 they could check something for me please the client insists they cant see it at all but i've tested it on exactly the same IE8/XP and it's fine. dont get it
[10:42:49] <jmp909> i removed the pngfix stuff that was crashing IE
[10:42:59] <jmp909> unless they dont know how to clear their cache ;)
[10:44:39] <Techdeck> ajpiano, save meeeee
[10:44:54] <ajpiano> Techdeck: stop highighting me every time you show up in the channel it weirds me out
[10:44:57] <Techdeck> ajpiano, I'm trying to detect whether a symbian device is a touch device or not
[10:45:08] <Techdeck> ajpiano, you are the only one usually knowing the answer to my questions
[10:45:14] <ajpiano> and i have no idea offhand how you'd do that
[10:45:18] <Techdeck> + you are one of the modernizr developers, right?
[10:45:23] <ajpiano> and no i'm not
[10:45:25] <ajpiano> that's alex
[10:45:29] <Techdeck> oops
[10:45:32] <Techdeck> sorry
[10:46:05] <Techdeck> anyways, I have the following: try {           document.createEvent("TouchEvent");            return true;        } catch (e) {            alert(e);            return false;        }
[10:46:39] <Techdeck> that's what modernizr does, but for some reason on nokia devices running symbian it is not supported. I have no idea what other event or thing to look for in order to detect whether its a touch device or not
[10:46:41] <Techdeck> any ideas?
[10:47:04] <ajpiano> no
[10:47:09] <Techdeck> :(
[10:47:16] <Techdeck> ok thanks anyway
[10:47:22] * Techdeck will keep headdesking
[10:48:55] <Techdeck> SlexAxton, any thoughts on this? :\
[10:51:13] <jmp909> http://www.peelentertainmentgroup.com/test/peelcruise/bannertest/?v=8
[10:51:23] <jmp909> any reason that would show a blank page in IE8?
[10:51:33] <Techdeck> I also tested: ('ontouchstart' in window)
[10:52:15] <SlexAxton> mobile devices can be weird, and often require you to touch the screen once before touch events work
[10:52:20] <SlexAxton> and there's nothing you can do about it
[10:52:53] <SlexAxton> except for potentially rerunning the test while the person interacts
[10:53:08] <SlexAxton> but that doesn't necessarily help...
[10:53:55] <Todd_LEFTART> jmp909, your page has a unclosed link tag, that would be a problem with xhtml maybe, not so sure
[10:54:22] <jmp909> thanks will fix anyway
[10:55:35] <jmp909> i dont understand why i can see it and they cant. unless theyre seeing a new js but an old css file
[10:55:44] <jmp909> cos they dont know how to clear their cache properly
[10:56:27] <jmp909> it was crashing before with using an AlphaImageLoader or DX Gradient pngfix but ive got rid of that under IE8 and it doesnt crash anymore
[10:56:32] <jmp909> but theyre saying they still cant see it
[10:56:33] <jmp909> grr
[10:57:45] <Todd_LEFTART> temporarily change the path of your css file,  see if it is the cache-problem
[10:57:50] <jmp909> also.. if i focus away from chrome and focus back some of the text layers get overlaid on top of each other.. i think chrome pauses execution or something when on another tab.. is there a way to fix that?
[10:58:12] <jmp909> its like it didnt finish the fade
[11:03:08] <jmp909> gtg speak later thanks for the heads up
[11:05:22] <velts> does anyone know an autocomplete plugin that matches the whole string opposed to just the first few charaters?
[11:05:58] <velts> example if some types "Foo" it matches "Food, FooBar, MyFooBar.. etc"
[11:06:37] <velts> most of the plugins i have seen would only match "Food, FooBar"
[11:07:10] <alabd1> Good day all , would you introduce me a free 3d chart jquery plugin ?
[11:09:55] <manuchill> can someone plz help me: i'm using latest jquery version and trying to do a ajax get with a custom accept header in a jsonp context but leaving the datatype out; as a response i receive an xml but not able to do anything with that response since Firebug is giving me some error
[11:14:27] <slimjimflim> i'm not sure if i'm using the right terminology on this, but if i want to unbind a select box and bind it to something else, would i use unbind("click") ?  unbind("select") ?
[11:15:04] <slimjimflim> if i use click, the resulting function runs when i first click the dropdown
[11:15:23] <slimjimflim> i don't want it to run until i click on one of the selections
[11:16:59] <Michael> slimjimflim:  you want 'change' probably
[11:17:24] <slimjimflim> so *.unbind("change") ?
[11:17:30] <Michael> No you would bind change
[11:17:42] <slimjimflim> oh right
[11:18:04] <slimjimflim> but it's already bound to something else
[11:18:14] <slimjimflim> you're sure i don't have to unbind first?
[11:19:13] <slimjimflim> k i did the unbind and the bind with change and that worked
[11:19:15] <slimjimflim> thanks
[11:19:27] <Michael> Np :)
[11:23:45] <muzone_> Brodingo: Still there?
[11:24:00] <Brodingo> sup
[11:24:18] <muzone_> I'm trying to get the jQuery Cycle Lite plugin working - http://jsfiddle.net/JNvjm/ - do I need to set all my li's to display: none; or something?
[11:27:29] <Brodingo> muzone_ youre missing the a
[11:27:37] <Brodingo> so your selector is wrong
[11:27:55] <Brodingo> also make sure you pick jquery on the side so it works in fiddle
[11:27:57] <lduros> is it good practice to start your plugin by, var myvar1, myvar2, myvar3, myvar4, myvar5; etc, or is it better to create those variables when I have something to assign them (still rather close to top)? jslint seems to choke on var myvar1 = jgds(); var myvar2 = fekjf(); -- tells me to use the previous var for myvar2
[11:28:11] <muzone_> oh shit
[11:28:14] <muzone_> i thought id picked it
[11:28:19] <muzone_> missing the a btw?
[11:29:08] <Brodingo> you have the second ul in an a so there isnt a ul child of the li
[11:30:45] <muzone_> Brodingo: not entirely sure I follow. I need that a there to wrap everything in under the same address - this cannot be done?
[11:31:15] <Brodingo> no the html is fine, but your jquery selector is wrong
[11:32:54] <muzone_> oh i see
[11:33:02] <Brodingo> http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/JNvjm/1/
[11:33:25] <muzone_> yeah :)) nice!
[11:33:42] <muzone_> hey before i go - i was just wondering - is there any way to make it only cycle when the mouse is hovering it?
[11:34:03] <Brodingo> im sure there is
[11:34:11] <slimjimflim> what's a good method that i could pass a url to and have the browser go to the url?
[11:34:22] <muzone_> Brodingo: are you familiar with such a way?
[11:34:50] <slimjimflim> procedural way even?
[11:35:36] <Brodingo> thanks muzone_
[11:36:18] <Brodingo> assuming i remember how cycle works you make a hover event on the ul to call the cycle instances pause or play methods
[11:37:08] <walli> window.location.assign(url)?
[11:37:39] <metropolis> Can anyone recommend a client-side logging framework for javascript that's jquery-friendly?
[11:37:40] <muzone_> Brodingo: yeah i can dig that
[11:38:07] <muzone_> Brodingo: mind showing me how it's done though, i've never used a hover event to trigger instance methods
[11:42:39] <Brodingo> muzone_ http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/JNvjm/3/
[11:43:42] <JackLeo> hey, anyone could help?
[11:44:38] <muzone_> Brodingo: wicked man, thanks!
[11:44:53] <muzone_> Brodingo: also curious why you set display block and width and height?
[11:45:16] <Brodingo> cycle sets all children of the container to position absolute
[11:45:17] <lduros> anybody going to the JQuery Conf?
[11:45:33] <ajpiano> me
[11:45:43] <kborchers> me too
[11:45:51] <Brodingo> muzone_ so consider also overflow:hidden to prevent FOUC
[11:45:59] <walli> [].forEach.call(document.links, window.open); // :>
[11:46:17] <lduros> ajpiano: kborchers: cool, considering going there. I'm starting to get into Jquery plugin development etc. Was wondering if it would be a good move. Only I don't think my employer would pay for it
[11:46:25] <muzone_> cool
[11:46:29] <muzone_> will do bro
[11:48:22] <kborchers> lduros: i would say it would be worth it. This talk might interest you http://benalman.com/news/2011/09/ill-be-speaking-at-the-2011-jquery-conference/
[11:48:50] <lduros> kborchers: cool, sounds good thank
[11:48:52] <lduros> you
[11:51:02] <muzone_> Brodingo: it does not work with timeout: 1000? would like the images to slide a little bit faster
[11:51:27] <Brodingo> timeout 0 is to pause it
[11:51:43] <Brodingo> speed is like speed or delay or something
[11:52:08] <Brodingo> speed in ms
[11:53:29] <muzone_> Brodingo: i've tried with speed: 1, speed: 10 etc. but it's still slow: http://jsfiddle.net/JNvjm/4/
[11:53:59] <Brodingo> oh ummmm
[11:54:19] <JAAulde> bah, to anyone who saw my earlier questions about XML and importing nodes from jQuery to an XML doc, I finally found the main part of my problem... our XML is fubar and has some camel casing and no DTD/schema, and .importNode is dropping the camel case to all lowers
[11:54:22] <JAAulde> sad Jimmy
[11:55:12] <muzone_> oh wait
[11:55:18] <muzone_> i think I get it Brodingo
[11:55:20] <sphinxxx> hey on this page https://opensky.com/p/new-design1   clicking the boxes doesn't work 100% to activate the slide
[11:55:33] <sphinxxx> i'm using the live event to bind to click, i've also tried the click event, same issue
[11:56:07] <muzone_> Brodingo: no wait, no i dont
[11:56:09] <muzone_> sorry
[12:02:43] <muzone_> Brodingo: it also seems to continue sliding when you take the mouse off the picture
[12:03:08] <muzone_> basically I'm trying to achieve this effect http://www.tobi.com/women/lingerie
[12:03:26] <simonleojung> sphinxxx: it seems you put the even on the .curatorbox and not the .catbox so it works 100% whenever you click an image
[12:03:35] <simonleojung> the event* not even
[12:04:36] <muzone_> At http://jsfiddle.net/JNvjm/4/ (using jQuery Cycle Lite) - does anybody know how to make the photos start cycling when you hover them, and pause when you take your mouse off them?
[12:05:02] <sphinxxx> simonleojung, thanks!
[12:05:09] <simonleojung> :)
[12:05:19] <Brodingo> muzone_ yeah its weird, its so easy and set up to do the opposite
[12:05:26] <Brodingo> pause on hover, but not the other way araound
[12:05:45] <muzone_> hehe
[12:06:34] <Brodingo> and the .cycle('command') doesnt seem to be working as expected
[12:09:17] <muzone_> Brodingo: I just sent a little complaint to the author
[12:09:31] <Brodingo> by complaint did you mean feature request
[12:09:53] <muzone_> Friendly complaint ofcourse, where I thanked him for his plugin which was like a breath of fresh air in a sea of monster plugins
[12:10:34] <muzone_> nah just "I was wondering - why is it so easy to set up jQuery Cycle Lite to pause on hover, but not the other way around? I'm trying to achieve this effect, but having a heck of a hard time: http://www.tobi.com/women/lingerie"
[12:12:38] <goldstar> what mouse handler can I use for mouse down/dragging ?
[12:12:48] <muzone_> Brodingo: so what to do? just wait for this dude to maybe add it as a feature?
[12:13:23] <hooloovoo> goldstar: Check if the mouse is down when the "mousemove" event happens
[12:16:23] <muzone_> Brodingo: thought id share our pastie with the author too. anything you'd wanna add to the comments i put in the js? http://jsfiddle.net/MJ7GE/1/
[12:17:09] <Brodingo> looks good
[12:17:41] <sphinxxx> oh simonleojung, the other thing was, when you firstl oad the page, the "back" link is showing on the left for some reason, but after you click a box and go back, it no longer does
[12:20:34] <Onca> help, I had a variable = document.getElementById(id); variable.innerHTML = string;
[12:20:34] <Onca> how can I do that with $('#' + id).html().text(string);
[12:20:40] <Onca> It's not working
[12:21:19] <kborchers> Onca: $('#' + id).html(string)
[12:21:32] <Onca> thanks
[12:21:41] <Onca> you know you're awesome.
[12:21:55] <Brodingo> he knows
[12:22:03] <JKarsrud> did someone say my name?
[12:22:05] <JKarsrud> :P
[12:22:47] <Onca> yah but I spelled egotistical wrong
[12:23:06] <Onca> heh, just kidding.
[12:23:16] <Onca> I couldn't think of the right word.
[12:23:36] <Onca> This is so much more awesome, kborchers that work like a charm.
[12:23:45] <kborchers> glad to help
[12:24:03] <codewhisperer> hi
[12:24:06] <Onca> hey
[12:24:54] <JKarsrud> Onca: haha, I'm just kidding :
[12:24:55] <JKarsrud> :)
[12:24:57] <Onca> It would be greatly appreciated, if someone could push me in the right direction, to handle http://url.com/index.html#id in javascript
[12:25:02] <JKarsrud> Just shout out if you need any more help tho :)
[12:25:20] <Onca> that wasn't a real link
[12:25:28] <codewhisperer> is it possible to turn this dinamically generated ul http://jsfiddle.net/s9JTQ/ to a list of ul's of 5 items each?
[12:25:34] <Onca>  the actual link is http://azimut.mooo.com/pictures/
[12:25:55] <JKarsrud> codewhisperer: sure :)
[12:26:02] <Onca> I want to append to it a #id to run showSlide()
[12:26:07] <codewhisperer> Like making a rule that worked if there where x number of li's inside the generated ul
[12:26:13] <Onca> am I making sense?
[12:26:28] <codewhisperer> JKarsrud: I would like to learn how :) Do you have some spare time on your hands?
[12:26:31] <simonleojung> sphinxxx: it seems that #slider1 needs to be positioned more left, probably due to other rule maybe, i tried changing it to left: -1092px
[12:26:38] <simonleojung> and it works fine
[12:26:39] <Onca> oh, the link is not azimut it's http://azimuth.mooo.com
[12:27:04] <JKarsrud> codewhisperer: sure, I can see if I can help you with that
[12:27:11] <JKarsrud> what exactly is it that you want?
[12:27:48] <simonleojung> sphinxxx: just as a note, it's because you have padding-left: 40px somewhere on that element
[12:28:27] <simonleojung> or mainly because you use no resets since it's the browser that's doing it for me
[12:28:43] <Onca> so, please wander and prod my site if you like, I am going to get a coffe. PM me if you think of an answer and I really apreciated the visits
[12:28:44] <simonleojung> back to work for me, cheers
[12:29:18] <Onca> the site is a server I whipped up myself, theres no cgi or anything funky and it's a single page and directories of content.
[12:29:30] <kborchers> Onca: not sure exactly what you are trying to do but i think you are looking for document.location.hash
[12:29:39] <Onca> awesome.
[12:29:49] <Onca> is there a jquery equivillent or is that it?
[12:30:48] <JKarsrud> that's it
[12:30:49] <bapii> Hey, is it possible to remove the a:hover property item on a object?
[12:30:54] <kborchers> Onca: no just that ... or window.location.hash, or either one. can't remember exactly
[12:31:01] <codewhisperer> JKarsrud: Basically I'm trying to solve a problem. I have a ul that will x number of li's, so I want to change it to several ul's with 5 li's inside of each. I want to do this to create some sort of slide navigation
[12:31:03] <djQuery> Onca: well theres see ?bbq
[12:31:04] <bot-t> Onca, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[12:32:27] <kborchers> you could use bbq but if you just need to grab the hash value, probably unnecessary. you may want to look into hashchange stuff in bbq
[12:35:06] <JKarsrud> codewhisperer: okay. What I'd do is split the array of list items after five items as long as that goes, and make new ul's based on that
[12:35:59] <JKarsrud> I'm kinda busy right now, and I have a flight early in the morning, so I'm off to bed soon, but I'll try to help as long as I can :)
[12:36:00] <codewhisperer> JKarsrud: Sounds good to me, but i've just realized that using that solution for my problem won't do :(
[12:36:08] <JKarsrud> okay?
[12:36:21] <codewhisperer> Because when I click a link from that list, it will always start from the beggining right?
[12:38:33] <JKarsrud> That depends on how you code it. I'm not sure I get what you're trying to do atm
[12:42:43] <madprops> if i have an attribute data-ts='something'  i can modify it with $(this).data('ts,'somethingelse') ;
[12:42:45] <madprops> ?
[12:46:45] <JKarsrud> madprops: it won't reflect on the dom, no..
[12:46:52] <JKarsrud> atleast I don't think so
[12:48:19] <danzik17> madprops: No, .data() does not update the DOM.  It only reads from it, and only the first time the data property is accessed if it doesn't already exist.
[12:48:49] <ikla> what's a good jquery plugin to style <select> and form inputs
[12:49:26] <TJCRI> anyone know a) why does jquery .ajax response return a string with a bunch of \n and \r  and b) is there a way to prevent it from doing that? its screwing up some of my js checking (like splicing off the last char of a returned string... which I thought was ; but in reality was a \n or \r
[12:52:06] <tmTim> I have a question.. I have to make a gallery for someone and it will have up to 50 images. JQuery wouldn't be good for this right since it would have to all load right on page load?
[12:52:17] <tmTim> I was considering a flash solution.. anyway afk a bit will read answers
[12:53:25] <slimjimflim> i wish flash would just die already
[12:53:27] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[12:53:35] <ProLoser|Work> is it possible to put a jquery template in js file?
[12:53:38] <ikla> what's a good jquery plugin to style forms?
[12:53:40] <ProLoser|Work> rather than in the html doc?
[12:54:18] <Brodingo> ikla its right here ---> css
[12:55:22] <kborchers> tmTim: I am building a gallery with jQuery right now that will have thousands of images. the images (and info about them) are loaded gradually as needed by pulling some JSON via AJAX. no waiting for all of the images to load and no flash
[12:59:38] <tmTim> kborchers: ok that is what I have to look into. the client wants the site to load very fast and then it can load more as the user clicks for next thumbs
[13:00:07] <tmTim> sort of like simple viewer flash thing
[13:00:24] <kborchers> exactly, that is what i am doing. loads fast, then you show a little loading animation or something while you pull in the next thumbs
[13:00:53] <tmTim> hmm I'll have to learn jQuery a bit more. not sure how to do that yet. just getting into it
[13:01:21] <tmTim> more of a designer but getting into the client coding more
[13:02:54] <tmTim> I really don't like to use flash anymore
[13:16:58] <tash1> forgive the ignorance, but I want to use the timepicker() addon. I see when I click on the download link for it from there: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ that it just shows me a bunch of source code.  Do I just add that to my html or do I add that to a .js file somewhere and make sure I put the link to it in my header?
[13:17:36] <localhost3000> hey all
[13:18:50] <localhost3000> is it possible to do nested {{if}} blocks in jquery templates? e.g. {{if foo}}first block{{if bar}}second block{{/if}}{{/if}}
[13:23:57] <ngharo> ?tias
[13:23:57] <bot-t> Try It And See
[13:25:12] <muzone_> I'm trying to use jQuery Cycle Lite to make this image cycle on hover: http://jsfiddle.net/qaFb2/ - But I'm unable to set the cycle speed, and the whole thing keeps on cycling after I remove my cursor from the image. Does anybody know how to fix this?
[13:25:54] <FalconHelmet_> hello room
[13:26:05] <localhost3000> answer to my own question: yes
[13:27:12] <FalconHelmet_> has anyone any experience with jquery mobile
[13:28:04] <uchuff> ya
[13:28:06] <uchuff> some
[13:30:35] <FalconHelmet_> I am using java script to generate some <ul>'s and it jquery doesn't pick up on the formating
[13:30:50] <FalconHelmet_> jcoupe.com/freebox/freeboxmobile
[13:31:10] <FalconHelmet_> ... if you click the music button
[13:31:53] <sphinxxx> whats the quickest way to convert a comma delimited string into an array?
[13:32:13] <ngharo> ?mdc split @ sphinxxx

[13:33:52] <uchuff> $("ul").listview();
[13:34:02] <FalconHelmet_> nice
[13:34:03] <uchuff> run .listview() on the ul
[13:34:06] <uchuff> ya i had to go check my code
[13:34:15] <FalconHelmet_> thanks so much
[13:34:43] <FalconHelmet_> I knew there was a way to return stuff to the jquery function but I had a brain fart
[13:34:44] <tash1> n/m my question
[13:35:54] <uchuff> FalconHelmet_: i think if you're adding stuff to an existing list you do listview("refresh")
[13:35:59] <bapii> Hey, is it possible to remove the a:hover property item on a object?
[13:36:02] <uchuff> fyi
[13:36:08] <uchuff> like if you were just appending more <li>
[13:37:33] <FalconHelmet_> ok
[13:37:35] <FalconHelmet_> thanks
[13:39:51] <FalconHelmet_> I always forget about the online jquery documentation ... I was using this incomplete O'Reilly book
[13:46:22] <SEJeff_work> What is the right way to do something like: $("#some_id").animate({"height": $("#some_id") + 20});
[13:46:35] <SEJeff_work> I'm trying to grow an element by 20px and animate it.
[13:47:07] <SEJeff_work> I saw someone do something like $("#some_id").height("+=20"), but that doesn't seem to work in the ways I would expect it to.
[13:48:07] <peol> SEJeff_work: $('#some-id').animate({ height: '+=20' }, 'slow');
[13:48:42] <bapii> is it possible to remove the a:hover property item on a object?
[13:49:03] <SEJeff_work> bapii, look up the docs on unbind
[13:51:42] <nikaoli_> hello guys
[13:52:55] <gebbione> any suggestion on how i can send a file using the $.ajax({ method?
[13:55:44] <tdignan> Is there a cool plugin somewhere that can: take a URL to an h.264 (mp4) video, and load it into an HTML5 player, but NOT download the file unless the user takes an action? I am not sure, but I just loaded up like 10-20 <video> tags and my browser is still loading stuff. I can only imagine this has to do with the 20 or so <video> tags I embedded

[13:57:54] <Woet> and clicking on it renders it :)
[13:58:07] <Woet> but i dont think its slow without preloading
[13:59:36] <codewhisperer> What are the chanches taxonomies permalinks work on one server and not on another one? I've changed a blog to a new server and all of the permalinks work ok, except the custom taxonomies
[14:00:11] <codewhisperer> oops sorry wrong window
[14:01:16] <supsup> question:  is there an apache server setting to force requests to not be cached temporarily?
[14:02:51] <lumo_e> hi all, I'm having trouble with the bounce effect, it seems to ignore the margin: auto property
[14:03:09] <lumo_e> googling I found that someone else had this problem http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-1-6-effect-bounce-ignores-margin-0-auto
[14:03:46] <lumo_e> do you guys know a workaround and if the ticket was actually created?
[14:13:10] <gebbione> would you guys know how to send the file without the use of the form plugin? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery
[14:13:33] <sphinxxx> how do you strip newline characters from beginning and/or end of a string?
[14:14:09] <gebbione> trim
[14:15:44] <jbdemonte> hi
[14:21:42] <jbdemonte> lol, no one here ...
[14:22:29] <tdignan> jbdemonte: new to IRC?
[14:22:55] <Woet> jbdemonte: that nobody says hi in a channel doesn't mean nobody is here
[14:23:04] <Woet> it means nobody cares about the 20,000th person who said hi :)
[14:23:08] <jbdemonte> @tdignan : not often there
[14:23:24] <tdignan> jbdemonte: drop the @, it interferes with the highlight functionality of every irc client
[14:23:38] <tdignan> just a tip
[14:23:46] <jbdemonte> @woet : know that but no one speaks ^^
[14:23:49] <tdignan> welcome to IRC, brace yourself for pedantry
[14:23:57] <gebbione> would you guys know how to send the file without the use of the form plugin? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery     anyone with ideas about this?
[14:24:05] <jbdemonte> tdignan : ok
[14:24:21] <tdignan> like just now, your name was yellow :)
[14:24:27] <jbdemonte> woet : ^^
[14:24:37] <tdignan> jbdemonte:
[14:24:47] <tdignan> Not sure if it works on the webirc.
[14:25:03] <tdignan> But it can, with javascript!
[14:25:37] <Woet> gebbione: by just putting the HTML for a file upload there?
[14:26:01] <jbdemonte> i haven't used mirc for years
[14:27:00] <gebbione> Woet not sure you have understood the problem?
[14:27:18] <gebbione> the input element is there but i need to send the file over an ajax call
[14:27:56] <Woet> gebbione: isn't the top answer on the link you gave the solution?
[14:28:01] <jbdemonte> does someone follow gmap3 on github here ?
[14:28:31] <gebbione> sure but with the use of a plugin
[14:28:50] <gebbione> i need to send a HEAD request for the file
[14:29:02] <gebbione> just to check at the server side the actual size of the file
[14:29:42] <Woet> gentz: you said without the form plugin
[14:29:44] <Woet> oops
[14:29:51] <Woet> gebbione: you said without the form plugin
[14:29:56] <Woet> without a plugin at all, im not sure
[14:30:17] <jbdemonte> gebbione : http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload
[14:31:16] <gebbione> well the overall objective is #fileElement.bind('change').ajax with HEAD request
[14:31:27] <gebbione> so the file is sent to the server where i verify its size
[14:31:34] <gebbione> i ll chec jbdemonte s likn
[14:35:12] <Omarpr> Hi guys
[14:35:56] <Omarpr> Im having a problem with $.post in jQuery, actually im triying to pass a form using serialize

[14:37:03] <bot-t> ravenzz, Couldn't find "demo Omarpr" in jQuery Docs.
[14:37:05] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Omarpr
[14:37:06] <bot-t> Omarpr, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:37:45] <Omarpr> no problem.
[14:37:51] <Omarpr> I have found what was the problem jajaja.
[14:37:55] <Omarpr> I have two fields with same name
[14:38:00] <Omarpr> I tyhat is why i dont see one.
[14:40:03] <gebbione> Omarpr i need an example of the serialize way, can u show me the script?
[14:41:17] <Omarpr> 				$('#TutoriaSub').click(function() { 					$.post('c.php', $('[name=tutorship_form]').serialize(), function(data) { 						alert(data); 					}); 				});
[14:41:50] <Omarpr> where it say alert is where you need to put what you want to do if is succesful
[14:42:00] <Omarpr> I just have an alert because im developing.
[14:42:19] <gebbione> sure thanks ...
[14:42:33] <jbdemonte> console.log is better than alert ^^
[14:42:41] <jbdemonte> try firebug
[14:43:18] <muzone_> I'm trying to make this image cycle on hover like on http://www.tobi.com/women/lingerie using jQuery Cycle Lite: http://jsfiddle.net/qaFb2/ - But I'm unable to set the cycle speed, and the whole thing keeps on cycling after I remove my cursor from the image. Does anybody know how to fix this?
[14:44:06] <ravenzz> Omarpr, gebbione http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:44:30] <Omarpr> ravenzz: ? xDDD
[14:44:33] <Omarpr> why you give that to me?
[14:44:43] <muzone_> Omarpr: he likes you
[14:44:50] <nikaoli_> hi
[14:44:52] <nikaoli_> $('#menu').hover(
[14:45:08] <nikaoli_> shouldn't that trigger a hover event for my div with id name of "#menu"?
[14:45:17] <ravenzz> Omarpr because of this http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide3
[14:45:18] <ravenzz> :P
[14:45:27] <muzone_> nikaoli_: $('#menu').hover()
[14:45:44] <nikaoli_> so its correct?
[14:46:16] <muzone_> you were missing a )
[14:46:33] <nikaoli_> well i ddint paste the inhandler and outhandler
[14:46:43] <nikaoli_> its there though
[14:46:47] <nikaoli_> but my code is not working
[14:47:07] <ravenzz> ?demo @ nikaoli_
[14:47:08] <bot-t> nikaoli_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:47:32] <nikaoli_> ok thanks, give me a sec
[14:48:22] <Omarpr> jajajajaja
[14:48:23] <Omarpr> ravenzz:
[14:48:25] <Omarpr> I am debugging text

[14:49:39] <jbdemonte> MUZONE / http://jsfiddle.net/qaFb2/2/
[14:51:35] <multipass> is it possible to check when a h2s text changes?
[14:54:02] <muzone_> jbdemonte: I don't understand
[14:54:19] <jbdemonte> what ?
[14:54:19] <nikaoli_> crap ravenzz
[14:54:21] <muzone_> jbdemonte: It's suppose to cycle when you hover it, and stop when you don't hover it
[14:54:30] <nikaoli_> i cant get my code to display in jsfiddle
[14:54:44] <jbdemonte> ok... didn't get that
[14:54:45] <jbdemonte> sorry
[14:55:01] <nikaoli_> woops, i didnt press the run button ^^
[14:56:03] <nikaoli_> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/hW6Rf/
[14:56:25] <muzone_> jbdemonte: Thanks though

[15:00:05] <nikaoli_> thanks Rave
[15:00:08] <nikaoli_> ravenzz:
[15:00:40] <nikaoli_> howcome "this" references the "#menu"?
[15:02:03] <ravenzz> nikaoli_ http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#selector-context
[15:02:46] <nikaoli_> thanks alot ravenzz
[15:03:16] <ravenzz> you're welcome
[15:04:17] <nikaoli_> 	so "this" references the eventhandler itself?
[15:04:36] <nikaoli_> is that how it is in other languages?
[15:04:47] <ravenzz> references the hovered element
[15:04:52] <ravenzz> in your case #menu
[15:05:01] <ravenzz> oh no sorry
[15:05:04] <nikaoli_> *eventhandler == event caller
[15:05:09] <ravenzz> I am a bit tired
[15:07:14] <ravenzz> $(document).ready(function() { $('#menu', this).hover() });
[15:07:23] <ravenzz> you are searching within the document
[15:07:46] <ravenzz> I mean, you don't need the second parameter there
[15:07:57] <ravenzz> $('#menu').hover() is good enough
[15:08:08] <nikaoli_> i dont
[15:08:19] <nikaoli_> * i didnt mean that
[15:09:01] <nikaoli_> $('#menu').hover( function () { $(this).stop().animate({'height':'70px'},2000); }, ......
[15:09:54] <nikaoli_> i mean its strange that the "$(this)" references the same menu that called the .hover event instead of referncing the document
[15:09:58] <ravenzz> oh sorry, I told you I am tired
[15:10:21] * nikaoli_ gives ravenzz a cup of Titan Coffee
[15:10:24] <nikaoli_> ^^

[15:11:36] <Eviltwin> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/07/help-the-community-report-browser-bugs/
[15:12:16] <jbdemonte> bye -
[15:15:47] <nikaoli_> question..... does js have compatibility issues as CSS does?
[15:16:18] <Eviltwin> nikaoli_: For some things, yes
[15:16:32] <Eviltwin> nikaoli_: jQuery works to eliminate those by handling the multi-implementations internally
[15:16:48] <nikaoli_> this compatibility stuff is sending me insane
[15:17:00] <Eviltwin> Welcome to web development
[15:17:03] <nikaoli_> lmao
[15:17:10] <Eviltwin> There's a reason we get paid for what we do
[15:17:17] <nikaoli_> i'm one incompatibility issue away from going back to flash
[15:17:28] <Eviltwin> Flash is dying
[15:17:30] <nikaoli_> *compatibility
[15:17:42] <nikaoli_> :O @ Eviltwin
[15:18:04] <Eviltwin> Fewer and fewer people are using it
[15:18:10] <Eviltwin> They realize it's so heavy weight
[15:18:16] <Eviltwin> And so few mobile devices are supporting it
[15:18:19] <Eviltwin> Or at least fully supporting it
[15:18:26] <nikaoli_> heavy weight in which sense?
[15:18:38] <Eviltwin> It takes A LOT of processing to do very simple things in Flash
[15:18:44] <nikaoli_> i thought that most mobile devices support flash.......youtube is flash......:O
[15:18:52] <nikaoli_> thats true Evi
[15:18:55] <nikaoli_> Eviltwin:
[15:18:59] <Eviltwin> YouTube has HTML5 video support
[15:19:11] <Eviltwin> Not for everything yet but they're pushing it more and more
[15:19:30] <Eviltwin> http://www.youtube.com/html5
[15:19:34] <nikaoli_> whaaaa??? :O i can implement video without flash now?
[15:19:40] <eveningsky|2> I still can't seem to get my head wrapped around deferreds and promises. How I would I do this? http://jsfiddle.net/KWQaQ/
[15:20:05] <Eviltwin> nikaoli_: Look at the browsers listed there
[15:20:13] <Eviltwin> They all support H.264 video
[15:20:16] <Eviltwin> Via HTML5
[15:20:17] <nikaoli_> :O
[15:20:31] <nikaoli_> so what will flash be used for in 4 years from now?
[15:20:36] <Eviltwin> Hopefully nothing
[15:20:40] <Eviltwin> As it's kind of a piece of shit
[15:21:47] <Omarpr> I have a question
[15:21:50] <nikaoli_> Eviltwin: did flash steal your mcdonald's fries as a kid? :P
[15:22:00] <Omarpr> Can I change something from various elements at same time?
[15:22:06] <Omarpr> example
[15:22:13] <Omarpr> or something likethat
[15:22:14] <Omarpr> $('[name=hour_in,hour_out]').timepicker({
[15:22:18] <Eviltwin> nikaoli_: http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html
[15:22:31] <nikaoli_> *clicking* @ Eviltwin
[15:22:46] <Eviltwin> Omarpr: Depends on the plugin
[15:22:55] <Omarpr> oh ok.
[15:22:58] <Omarpr> im using the jquery ui
[15:23:01] <Omarpr> datepicker
[15:23:17] <Eviltwin> Have you...tried it?
[15:24:14] <nikaoli_> Eviltwin:  that information is no longer relevant
[15:24:18] <Omarpr> no
[15:24:20] <nikaoli_> that was written in 2000
[15:25:32] <nikaoli_> i dont think that flash will go down the road of realplayer, but as far as building "straight" websites, flash is a bit too much
[15:26:15] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_HTML5_and_Flash
[15:26:34] <Eviltwin> Omarpr: Why don't you try it first?
[15:26:46] <eveningsky|2> flash suffers from being closed source. it's greatest strenght is it's greatest weakness.
[15:27:07] <Eviltwin> Omarpr: Or assume it doesn't work and do $('[name=hour_in,hour_out]').each(function(){$(this).timepicker({...})});
[15:27:15] <Eviltwin> eveningsky|2: How's that a strength?
[15:27:39] <eveningsky|2> Eviltwin: only one implementation
[15:27:49] <Omarpr> eveningsky|2: thanks.
[15:27:53] <Eviltwin> eveningsky|2: That Adobe has to maintain
[15:27:54] <Omarpr> Eviltwin: thanks!
[15:28:08] <Eviltwin> eveningsky|2: Not to mention they have different quirks on different systems
[15:29:32] <nikaoli_> remember when intel owned flash?
[15:30:05] <nikaoli_> this looks like a lot of big brother antics to prevent competition/monopoly
[15:30:06] <zeta-> I'm using a click() function that depends on the :checked status of an input.
[15:30:08] <zeta-> Unfortunately, the click() is triggered before the check happens, so I have to click twice to get them both in sync. :-(
[15:30:09] <eveningsky|2> nikaoli_: no
[15:30:11] <zeta-> Do I need something like jQuery.Deferred
[15:30:23] <Eviltwin> When did Intel own Flash?
[15:30:26] <nikaoli_> eveningsky|2: macromedia was an intel company
[15:30:40] <eveningsky|2> didn't know that
[15:30:46] <nikaoli_> if i remember correctly
[15:31:03] <Eviltwin> This Macromedia? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia
[15:31:07] <Eviltwin> I see no mention of Intel
[15:32:52] <nikaoli_> oh.......they had a partnership with intel
[15:33:25] <nikaoli_> (shockwave3d)
[15:33:56] <Eviltwin> That makes more sense
[15:34:28] <nikaoli_> but i remember seeing somewhere on macromedia's site back in the day "an Intel Company"
[15:34:33] <nikaoli_> i may of remembered that wrong
[15:35:10] <Eviltwin> Netsplit?
[15:35:48] <draginx> is there anyway to do mouseover on select > option ?
[15:36:54] <cpgo> is it not possible to change fonts using .css('font-family', 'Verdana'); (or any font name)
[15:37:53] <Eviltwin> draginx: I don't believe so as it is handled by the browser
[15:38:01] <Eviltwin> draginx: I think you'd have to fake the select if you wanted to do that
[15:38:36] <draginx> what do u mean by fake?
[15:39:02] <Eviltwin> draginx: Create and style a <ul> that looks like a dropdown menu
[15:39:48] <draginx> yer ill have to do that =/ thanks
[15:39:53] <Eviltwin> cpgo: It should, I think
[15:40:09] <cpgo> gonna try in another browser
[15:41:04] <cpgo> nope :S
[15:42:35] <cpgo> hmm it works, but not on body tag
[15:43:29] <sphinxxx> how can i prevent this page's content from being pushed down when the browser window's width is small  https://opensky.com/p/new-design1
[15:44:17] <cpgo> Eviltwin, html, body, table don't work, but applying it to 'table tr td' does
[15:44:31] <Eviltwin> Perhaps there's a style on TR or something?
[15:44:47] <cpgo> theres no css on the page
[15:45:03] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: You set a fixed width?
[15:45:08] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: Or min-width
[15:45:24] <sphinxxx> i set a min-width on the #mid element
[15:45:28] <sphinxxx> but doesn't seem to do anything
[15:45:47] <foull> hello all
[15:47:01] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: It looks like it's JavaScript's fault
[15:47:17] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: Try shrinking your browser window, refreshing, and resizing
[15:47:22] <Eviltwin> Or vice-versa
[15:47:54] <albertosheinfeld> hey guys, i am appending one div with an image inside another div but when i inspect the elements, both divs has 0 height, why can this be happening???
[15:48:13] <sphinxxx> eviltwin, yea thats when it happens, if i resize smaller and refresh i see the problem
[15:48:26] <sphinxxx> if i load it big, and then resize it doesnt mess anything up, only upon the refresh
[15:48:31] <Eviltwin> Right
[15:48:37] <Eviltwin> Which feels very JavaScript issue to me
[15:49:05] <albertosheinfeld> hey guys, i am appending one div with an image inside another div but when i inspect the elements, both divs has 0 height, why can this be happening???
[15:50:37] <Eviltwin> albertosheinfeld: Can you make an example of this issue as a jsFiddle?
[15:50:54] <Eviltwin> Here: http://jsfiddle.net/
[15:51:12] <Omarpr> Hi guys, again.
[15:51:37] <Omarpr> I hate a question, I hate a string with special chars like: "Tutor&iacute;a"
[15:51:50] <Omarpr> but it dont shows the í in the alert(STRING);
[15:52:10] <Omarpr> I have read I need to change it to unicode... but how i do it using jquery or javascript?
[15:53:22] <Eviltwin> Omarpr: Not sure how fast it is but try $("<span/>").html(STRING).text()
[15:58:46] <albertosheinfeld> sure
[16:03:44] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Thanks for the offers to test. Getting close to having a link for you all. ★ http://bit.ly/oBP4J3
[16:08:01] <Omarpr> Eviltwin: that worked great!
[16:08:02] <Omarpr> thanks man.
[16:08:13] <Eviltwin> No problem
[16:08:36] <Eviltwin> Generally alerts are frowned upon though
[16:08:40] <Eviltwin> Not a great way of interacting with the user
[16:09:00] <Dave_Stein> One time I left an alert in by mistake and someone blogged about it
[16:09:21] <Dave_Stein> fancybox is a useful jQuery plugin
[16:10:01] <Eviltwin> Lots of sites have console.log left in all over the place
[16:10:05] <Eviltwin> That breaks non-Firebugged Firefox
[16:10:22] <Dave_Stein> ha that's why i have if typeof console === 'undefined' logic that makes it not break
[16:10:39] <Dave_Stein> i usually just define it then and make a function that does nothing
[16:11:33] <Dave_Stein> before that, console logs did end up in code too often although its a huge habit of mine to search for console log in any file im about to commit
[16:16:05] <Eviltwin> I usually shortcut with if(!window.console)
[16:16:22] <Eviltwin> If it's falsy, it's definitely not a console object
[16:16:26] <Dave_Stein> true
[16:17:04] <Dave_Stein> same difference in the end :) i just stay away from falsy so coworkers don't use it in cases where it would be detrimental
[16:17:16] <Dave_Stein> i keep it a habit that people use=== as much as possible
[16:17:30] <janthony> Is there a way to do an event based on when the enter button is pressed inside an input field? It's not inside a form, so not .submit()
[16:17:45] <Dave_Stein> on the callback check e.keyCode
[16:18:06] <Dave_Stein> you can compare it to  $.ui.keyCode.ENTER
[16:18:38] <Dave_Stein> and if it matches what you want you can stopPropagation which i frequently typo
[16:18:40] <janthony> Dave_Stein: so .keypress(function(e) { // check here });
[16:18:53] <Dave_Stein> janthony: yup
[16:19:21] <Dave_Stein> janthony: that should do it, im blurry on the submit event timing vs keypress/up/down
[16:25:35] <Dave_Stein> #lame http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7231054/file-input-size-issue-in-safari-for-multiple-file-selection
[16:49:08] <Rotham> hey... will .animate execute asynchronously, or will the next line of code wait to execute when the animation  is complete?
[16:49:27] * Rotham should probably just experiment but hes being lazy
[16:50:16] <coldhead> it's async
[16:50:23] <coldhead> now get back to work
[16:54:02] <johnwarren> I'm getting "null" or "undefined" when I try to run jQuery to find a "background-position." This only happens in Internet Explorer. Any ideas? 	var rawY = jQuery(cssID).css('background-position');
[17:00:00] <coldhead> johnwarren: maybe IE doesn't support that property?
[17:00:23] <johnwarren> coldhead: Close…turns out to be a pre-IE9 thing that is just weird http://joncom.be/code/jquery-css-background-position/
[17:07:47] <coldhead> bot-t: tell johnwarren i'm sorry
[17:07:47] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[17:16:19] <booboonathan> Does anyone know a plugin for a vertical slide out menu?

[17:18:54] <MistuhKurtz> I've taken to doing things like that myself booboonathan
[17:19:16] <MistuhKurtz> usually I end up being able to do exactly what I want easier and faster
[17:19:40] <MistuhKurtz> just a suggestion :)
[17:21:27] <gebbione> anyone has a suggestion here on how to get the filesize <input type=file ... in IE?
[17:23:57] <adv_> why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/CXMYU/1/
[17:27:42] <opius> hi, i'm trying to sort a <UL> containing <LI>'s with <DIV>'s inside , depending on the DIV style.. is this possible?
[17:28:02] <coldhead> anything is possible if you can imagine it!
[17:28:10] <coldhead> that's what being a computer scientist is all about!
[17:28:20] <coldhead> you will probably want to look at
[17:28:22] <coldhead> ?mdc sort
[17:28:23] <bot-t> coldhead, sort - MDN Docs - Sorts the elements of an array in place. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[17:28:39] <opius> thank you
[17:28:43] <coldhead> specifically the bit where you provide it an argument that sorts for you
[17:28:59] <coldhead> you'll need to write a special DIV sorter function
[17:29:05] <coldhead> i hope you have fun with it!
[17:29:26] <angelsanchezjr> hi every body
[17:29:54] <coldhead> gebbione: i don't think IE makes that info available
[17:30:32] <coldhead> adv_: browsers don't generally let you mess with file inputs :(
[17:30:38] <coldhead> it's a security thing
[17:31:03] <coldhead> $('#file').val('/etc/passwrd').closest('form').submit() // NOOOO
[17:31:31] <Kamakazi> keeping multidimensional arrays straight in my head makes it hurt
[17:31:38] <adv_> coldhead, but i have the same code and it works on my page, that is just a snippet. cant find out why i cant reproduce that
[17:33:48] <coldhead> adv_: at the risk of asking a stupid question, if it works on your page, why are you trying to reproduce it?
[17:34:10] <adv_> coldhead, to show you guys so you can help me with smth :)
[17:35:14] <coldhead> who debugs the debuggers
[17:35:44] <coldhead> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/CXMYU/2/
[17:35:46] <coldhead> i'm an idiot
[17:35:54] <coldhead> i thought it was failing because you had input type=file
[17:36:05] <coldhead> but it was failing because you had mootools, not jquery, selected on the left
[17:36:08] <coldhead> ME SO SORRY
[17:37:10] <adv_> coldhead, ah sorry!
[17:37:11] <adv_> damn
[17:38:24] <adv_> so my real question now is , how can i have file1 copied into the input text , if i directly click at file1 . atm i can't do that
[17:38:39] <adv_> i need to select file2 and then file1 in order for it to work
[17:40:32] <lduros> finally got this ticket for jquery conf in boston. the hotel is fully booked already :-( Wasn't this afternoon
[17:41:42] <wookiehangover> shitty, I still need to book mine too
[17:42:07] <lduros> wookiehangover: I booked at the marriott cambridge 16mn by feet
[17:42:30] <lduros> not too bad I guess
[17:42:48] <wookiehangover> one of my co workers is speaking, I may just crash on his floor
[17:56:47] <coldhead> adv_: try .bind('click change')
[17:56:50] <coldhead> to catch both
[17:57:23] <adv_> coldhead, hm where do i put that exaclty
[17:57:23] <adv_> ?
[17:57:54] <steveoh> when creating a dialog can you fetch the html on instantiation like with dojo and href or do you have to fetch the contents on some event?
[17:59:52] <coldhead> adv_: change ...change(function... to ...bind('click change', function...
[18:02:00] <adv_> coldhead, http://jsfiddle.net/CXMYU/5/
[18:02:05] <adv_> am i doing smth wrong?
[18:06:11] <coldhead> adv_: you're still using mootools, you dolt :P
[18:08:46] <adv_> coldhead, lol sorry! http://jsfiddle.net/CXMYU/6/ but it still doesnt work :/
[18:10:11] <booboonathan> Can anyone help me with a z-index issue
[18:10:20] <booboonathan> its been annoying me for the past 2 hours.
[18:10:31] <coldhead> it works for me, adv_ http://jsfiddle.net/CXMYU/7/
[18:11:12] <adv_> coldhead, thanks!
[18:11:22] <coldhead> adv_: makes sense?
[18:11:29] <adv_> coldhead, yes now
[18:12:15] <coldhead> booboonathan: z-indexes are hard. link to your demo?
[18:25:33] <coldhead> booboonathan: have you tried setting the z-indexes on various parent elements?
[18:30:55] <fabiobik> hi guys
[18:31:42] <booboonathan> coldhead, yep
[18:31:49] <booboonathan> I'm working round it now anyway
[18:31:51] <booboonathan> ive given up
[18:32:47] <coldhead> onward and upward!
[18:32:50] <coldhead> hi fabiobik
[18:33:09] <fabiobik> how can i position the |   in start of text area?
[18:33:17] <booboonathan> whats the css for vertical text again?
[18:33:22] <booboonathan>  writing-mode: tb-rl; doesn't work
[18:33:34] <fabiobik> i mean when i clic on text area the cursor not start on begining. sometimes go to center
[18:39:05] <fabiobik> how can i position the |   in start of text area?
[18:39:07] <fabiobik> i mean when i clic on text area the cursor not start on begining. sometimes go to center
[18:39:12] <fabiobik> *click

[18:46:15] <booboonathan> does anyone know of a function in query to make all links appear to fade in on hover?
[18:48:11] <ngharo> 0_o
[18:49:53] <donCams> booboonathan: $('a').hover(function() { $(this).fadeOut(); }, function() { $(this).fadeIn(); });
[18:50:20] <JohnnyDavidson> Can I do like
[18:50:24] <JohnnyDavidson> on any sort of change?
[18:50:50] <JohnnyDavidson> Like I'm using .keyup for a bunch of text boxes, but I also need to include a checkbox, so now that doesn't relaly work
[18:51:28] <coldhead> .bind('click change keyup focus') ?
[18:52:25] <booboonathan> donCams
[18:52:40] <booboonathan> i'm not that stupid, i've tried that, however it has a blinking like effect
[18:52:46] <booboonathan> my code is:
[18:52:47] <booboonathan> 	$('a').not('.ne').hover(function() {
[18:52:47] <booboonathan> 		$(this).hide(0);
[18:52:47] <booboonathan> 		
[18:52:47] <booboonathan> 			$(this).fadeIn(500);
[18:52:47] <booboonathan> 		}, function() {
[18:52:49] <booboonathan> 		});
[18:53:11] <coldhead> booboonathan: try fadeTo(0) and fadeTo(1)
[18:53:16] <coldhead> rather than hide()
[18:53:30] <coldhead> ?fadeTo
[18:53:31] <bot-t> .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[18:54:17] <coldhead> better use the docs instead of my bogus examples
[18:54:22] <coldhead> but you'll see what i mean
[18:55:04] <booboonathan> coldhead i gave it a go, still same sort of blinking
[18:55:06] <booboonathan> really annoying
[18:55:19] <booboonathan> code is now:
[18:55:19] <booboonathan> 	$('a').not('.ne').hover(function() {
[18:55:19] <booboonathan> 		$(this).fadeTo(0, 0);
[18:55:19] <booboonathan> 		$(this).fadeTo(500, 1);
[18:55:19] <booboonathan> 		}, function() {
[18:55:19] <booboonathan> 	});
[18:55:34] <booboonathan> works, but same problem as the last
[18:55:50] <coldhead> can you get a working demo up on jsfiddle?
[18:55:51] <coldhead> ?p
[18:55:51] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:56:01] <coldhead> maybe i don't understand
[18:58:59] <booboonathan> yeah
[18:59:02] <booboonathan> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/kPdtt/
[18:59:14] <coldhead> thanks bro
[19:00:00] <booboonathan> see what i mean?
[19:00:02] <coldhead> yeah um, that's doing exactly what the code says >: \
[19:00:17] <booboonathan> well, how do you think i would get rid of the flash?
[19:01:07] <daleharvey> I am using deferreds to fire off an array of http requests
[19:01:10] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/kPdtt/1/
[19:01:27] <daleharvey> when I am inside the callback, I need to know which request I am currently processing
[19:01:29] <coldhead> booboonathan: that's how i generally do it
[19:01:31] <coldhead> something like that
[19:01:36] <daleharvey> any way to attach data / figure out the context?
[19:01:41] <coldhead> or better yet, with the animateClass plguin
[19:02:37] <booboonathan> animateclass?
[19:02:42] <booboonathan> example pl0x <3
[19:02:48] <coldhead> ask google
[19:03:12] <coldhead> it lets you move the before and after styles to CSS
[19:03:20] <coldhead> and then it animates between them
[19:03:27] <coldhead> you just tell it the classes in jQuery
[19:03:40] <booboonathan> ahh yeah i know what you mean
[19:03:49] <booboonathan> ill do that at the end of the project then
[19:03:54] <booboonathan> got so much shit to get on with
[19:03:58] <booboonathan> thanks
[19:03:59] <JohnnyDavidson> How do I give text an ID?
[19:04:44] <cpgo> wrap it in an element? p or span
[19:05:15] <coldhead> good call, cpgo
[19:05:32] <JohnnyDavidson> The problem is that it creates a <br> after
[19:05:37] <JohnnyDavidson> Which I don't want
[19:05:57] <booboonathan> oO
[19:06:00] <booboonathan> use
[19:06:02] <booboonathan> <font>
[19:06:16] <booboonathan> not exactly xhtml compliant
[19:06:18] <booboonathan> however it works
[19:06:25] <JohnnyDavidson> That works I guess
[19:06:28] <JohnnyDavidson> thanks
[19:06:28] <booboonathan> or <span>
[19:06:36] <JohnnyDavidson> What is span used for?
[19:06:57] <booboonathan> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp
[19:07:20] <booboonathan> its like the xhtml version of font
[19:07:22] <booboonathan> <font>*
[19:07:43] <kborchers> don't use w3schools!  http://w3fools.com/
[19:08:48] <JohnnyDavidson> Also how would you modify the date in a span?
[19:09:03] <JohnnyDavidson> .attr('innerHTML','')?
[19:09:09] <JohnnyDavidson> the data*
[19:09:21] <booboonathan> assign the span with an id
[19:09:24] <kborchers> ?html @ JohnnyDavidson
[19:09:24] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[19:09:26] <cpgo> or .html
[19:09:42] <booboonathan> kborchers, fair point!
[19:12:35] <webguynow> reviewing the jQuery .get() method -  I read some pages about security concerns, and they reccomended using only 'text' datatype for return - but I don't even see that listed.  ???  comments ?
[19:13:51] <kborchers> webguynow: get() is just a shortcut for ajax(). you should read this and it will probably help see ?ajax
[19:13:52] <bot-t> webguynow, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[19:16:26] <webguynow> yep  I'm all over that
[19:17:17] <webguynow> was suprised a 'text' data type was not listed
[19:18:32] <coldhead> people don't use text much anymore
[19:18:43] <coldhead> these days it's all JSON this or XML that
[19:18:48] <coldhead> YAML the other
[19:22:01] <webguynow> is there an alternate or short hand to $(document).ready()   ?
[19:22:07] <webguynow> found this interesting
[19:22:08] <tonyjcamp> $(function()
[19:22:10] <webguynow> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6004129/document-ready-shorthand
[19:22:22] <daleharvey> put your scripts at the bottom of the page and ignore document.ready whatsoever
[19:22:39] <webguynow> the post would disagree with you Tony
[19:24:23] <coldhead> firstly, you should use ready() even at the bottom of the page
[19:24:26] <coldhead> in case SOMETHING HAPPENS
[19:24:30] <coldhead> and your shit gets moved
[19:24:52] <coldhead> and secondly, you shouldn't use the $() shortcut except in your quick personal hacks
[19:25:07] <tonyjcamp> orly? Bad practice?
[19:25:11] <coldhead> unless you want to pay me $2 for every time i have to explain to a noob what it does
[19:25:16] <tonyjcamp> lol
[19:25:17] <coldhead> and that there's no difference
[19:25:24] <coldhead> in which case please give me $180000
[19:25:37] <daleharvey> heh, I dont defensively code against people moving my code around randomly
[19:25:39] <tonyjcamp> :x
[19:25:40] <coldhead> ready() is more readable :)
[19:26:01] <coldhead> it's not defensive, it's more a guarantee
[19:26:12] <coldhead> what do you gain by not using ready?
[19:26:33] <coldhead> plus noobs think they don't need it and put their stuff in head
[19:26:38] <coldhead> and then it doesn't work
[19:26:39] <tonyjcamp> Looks way cooler!
[19:26:43] <coldhead> and they come and ask here
[19:26:57] <coldhead> and then they're like "is there any difference between $() and .ready() ?"
[19:27:08] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: were you here when ajpiano answered my question from last night?
[19:27:11] <coldhead> and i can only sadly put my genitals on the piano keys
[19:27:17] <coldhead> and smash the lid down over and over
[19:27:20] <tonyjcamp> about the ;(function() {})(); ?
[19:27:27] <daleharvey> the same thing I gain by not using fooBar library, I dont add code thats utterly pointless to my stuff :P
[19:27:30] <coldhead> no, can you link me from lampoon?
[19:27:42] <coldhead> find it here, tonyjcamp lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[19:27:53] <coldhead> i don't want to dispute his official policy
[19:28:03] <coldhead> or have to put his genitals in the piano
[19:29:01] <daleharvey> I am seriously confused out how this domloaded / document.ready stuff ever got started
[19:30:39] <coldhead> unless you need to know, just always use ready()
[19:30:44] <coldhead> and let's try to get on with our lives
[19:34:24] <webguynow> with $.get() what is the best - safest practice for URL - use full path ?
[19:35:13] <daleharvey> use relative from root
[19:35:25] <daleharvey> $.get("/somepath"
[19:35:58] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: Looking at lampoon, never used it, and I can only seem to go back about 2 hours… is there a trick I'm missing?
[19:36:33] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I make a selector select everything in a table?
[19:36:42] <JohnnyDavidson> Like $('#tableX')
[19:37:01] <coldhead> tonyjcamp: should be all there, no tricks. i'll bug aj about it
[19:37:12] <kborchers> ?contents @ JohnnyDavidson
[19:37:12] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[19:37:22] <tonyjcamp> no worries, I think I got it now. Sec
[19:37:50] <JohnnyDavidson> So could I do $('#tableX').contents.bind()?
[19:38:07] <kborchers> what are you trying to do?
[19:38:15] <JohnnyDavidson> Bind something to all elements in a table
[19:38:38] <kborchers> every element? every tr, every td, etc. ?
[19:38:53] <danzik171> JohnnyDavidson: I'd use ?delegate for that and set the selector to #tableX * or whatever you want
[19:38:54] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[19:42:02] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: want me to IM you the link, or just post it in the room?
[19:42:27] <tonyjcamp> Just looked, and the timezone on the logs are GMT, so technically that question was answered 'yesterday' heh
[19:43:34] <coldhead> just post it
[19:43:40] <coldhead> it's not exactly secret :)
[19:43:45] <tonyjcamp> http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery/2011-09-07#T4523499
[19:43:54] <coldhead> the timestamps are actually somewhere in india
[19:44:02] <coldhead> that's something and a half hours off gmt
[19:44:05] <coldhead> terribly weird
[19:45:56] <webguynow> Not knowing the exact structure of my AJAX data returned, How can I loop thru it  ?
[19:47:23] <tonyjcamp> Can you console.log the returned object?
[19:47:27] <tonyjcamp> And see the data in there?
[19:48:32] <tonyjcamp> Or do you have a jsFiddle we can look at?
[19:49:26] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there a reason why animate won't work?
[19:49:43] <JohnnyDavidson> If I just directly set the attribute it works, but doing the same with animate doesn't work
[19:49:45] <tonyjcamp> What are you trying to animate, and how?
[19:50:00] <JohnnyDavidson> Just something simple like changing the width of something
[19:50:47] <donCams> JohnnyDavidson, jsfiddle :3
[19:52:26] <tonyjcamp> $('div').animate({ width: '590px' });  yah?
[19:53:55] <donCams> JohnnyDavidson, $('div').animate({'width' : '-=590px'}, 'slow');
[19:54:00] <donCams> wooot
[19:55:46] <JohnnyDavidson> Thanks
[19:56:03] <JohnnyDavidson> I forgot to wrap the xxx px in quotes
[19:57:04] <tonyjcamp> careful with other properties too, sometimes , I believe the key needs to be in quotes too. Just depends
[20:02:22] <JohnnyDavidson> I know this probably can't be done easily
[20:02:57] <JohnnyDavidson> But is it possible to animate any time something changes in size, like a table or something, but without having to do it all manually knowing the pixel size etc
[20:04:58] <tonyjcamp> What will cause it to change in size.
[20:05:21] <JohnnyDavidson> Just an element changing in the table
[20:05:28] <JohnnyDavidson> Then the table will auto resize
[20:05:35] <JohnnyDavidson> I'm guessing there's no easy way
[20:06:14] <tonyjcamp> Well, I'm trying to see if we can do it with an event handler.
[20:06:32] <tonyjcamp> Like, if someone clicks a button, or changes some text in the table or...
[20:06:53] <JohnnyDavidson> Yeah it is in an event handler
[20:06:56] <JohnnyDavidson> When the table changes
[20:07:21] <tonyjcamp> Did you get a jsfiddle example set up ?
[20:08:19] <JohnnyDavidson> No sorry
[20:08:26] <JohnnyDavidson> I think there is too many external files to do that
[20:08:27] <tonyjcamp> That would help out a lot.
[20:08:37] <JohnnyDavidson> It's not a big deal, I was mostly just wondering
[20:08:38] <tonyjcamp> ah ok
[20:08:42] <JohnnyDavidson> I can just try and do it the manual way
[20:08:58] <JohnnyDavidson> If something is 100px on someones computer, would it be 100px on everyones computer?
[20:09:06] <JohnnyDavidson> In terms of a certain font, size, etc.
[20:09:12] <JohnnyDavidson> Would it all appear the same length in terms of pixels?
[20:09:32] <JohnnyDavidson> Like a string of text I mean
[20:10:23] <tonyjcamp> So you just want to make the table 100 pixels taller or something?
[20:10:32] <tonyjcamp> or wider, whatever?
[20:11:51] <tonyjcamp> If it's text, inside of an element (p, div, etc) you can get the width of that element and animate the height (or whatever) by that value.
[20:12:38] <tonyjcamp> So that way, the value that you're using to animate the table will be dependent on how significant the change to the table will be.
[20:13:08] <tonyjcamp> It's kind of hard for me to visualize what you're wanting to do exactly.
[20:15:29] <JohnnyDavidson> Well pretty much
[20:15:36] <JohnnyDavidson> Let's say I have a table with a single td with text
[20:15:43] <JohnnyDavidson> and I click a button, and the text changes
[20:16:03] <JohnnyDavidson> And the table has a background, so you can see it
[20:16:10] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I make it animate to the size of the new text
[20:16:17] <JohnnyDavidson> Do you know what I mean now?
[20:16:26] <JohnnyDavidson> It's kind of hard to just estimate the pixels
[20:17:34] <ae86-drifter> hello, has anyone had problems with a jquery draggable() element flickering? While dragging, it seems to flicker between the original position and the proper dragged position several times per second, it doesnt happen all the time, cant seem to figure out why
[20:18:13] <JohnnyDavidson> tonyjcamp any ideas?
[20:18:21] <tonyjcamp> Yes, second.
[20:19:47] <JohnnyDavidson> Alright thanks for the help
[20:22:20] <ae86-drifter> the only event i am binding to is the dragstop event, so why is the position being modified while dragging?
[20:30:21] <ae86-drifter> it's not a browser specific issue, or an issue specific to a jquery version as ive tried about 5 combinations of each
[20:36:37] <amh345> is textfill the go-to plugin for dynamically resizing text to fit in an area?
[20:51:09] <booboonathan> can anyone name me a vertical tab plugin

[20:52:15] <booboonathan> pl0x
[20:53:47] <booboonathan> i basically need help with single selectors
[20:54:06] <booboonathan> I have 4 li's, but i want to target the <span> inside each li seperately
[20:54:19] <booboonathan> so i hover hover one li, and it will show() the span in that li
[20:54:27] <booboonathan> and not the others, i have a demo if you want?
[20:54:36] <ae86-drifter> $(li.whatever span)
[20:54:54] <ae86-drifter> i mean $('li.whatever span')
[20:55:19] <booboonathan> yeah figured the '
[20:55:22] <booboonathan> but it doesn't seem to work
[20:56:06] <booboonathan> it still selects them all
[20:56:41] <dcope> Is there a working text overflow plugin that allows me to set the string to use?
[20:57:10] <ae86-drifter> $('li.whatever').hover(function(){$('li.whatever span').show();},function(){$('li.whatever span').hide();})
[20:57:20] <ae86-drifter> or something along those lines
[20:57:45] <ae86-drifter> might need to use this instead of li.whatever in the functions
[20:59:19] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile Beta 3 planned for tomorrow! ★ http://bit.ly/qcQlga
[20:59:48] <booboonathan> Nope still not working
[20:59:50] <booboonathan> can I not do something like
[20:59:57] <booboonathan> $(this 'span')
[21:00:03] <booboonathan> (obviously i know thats a syntax error
[21:00:03] <booboonathan> )
[21:00:19] <booboonathan> do you check your PMs ae86-drifter
[21:00:33] <amh345> is textfill the go-to plugin for dynamically resizing text to fit in an area?
[21:02:35] <ae86-drifter> $('span', this)
[21:19:32] <booboonathan> http://jsfiddle.net/9VW5e/
[21:19:50] <booboonathan> I can't get it to show individual <span>'s on hover
[21:20:13] <booboonathan> if i just use show() then it shows them all, and i can't use select properly to make it select individuals
[21:20:19] <booboonathan> any help pl0x would be amazing
[21:23:42] <booboonathan> ?
[21:28:25] <amh345> is there a way to get the content of 'this'?
[21:28:44] <Cork> ?.html @ amh345
[21:28:44] <bot-t> amh345, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[21:29:07] <Cork> amh345: if thats what you mean
[21:29:32] <amh345> hmm.. alert($(this).html()); is returning null
[21:29:32] <Cork> or do you mean do a jquery query from the current element?
[21:29:49] <Cork> if so then this isn't a dom element
[21:29:51] <amh345> i want to get the current element that ive just clicked
[21:30:16] <amh345> my autosizing of text isnt working and im trying to figure out what's going on with it
[21:30:23] <Cork> $(this).html() should defenitly not return null if its on click...
[21:30:45] <Cork> your inside another function?
[21:30:53] <Cork> like $.each or something?
[21:30:58] <amh345> im inside document ready
[21:31:12] <Cork> uh... in the click event...
[21:31:30] <Cork> if your directly inside document ready, then your not in an event
[21:31:33] <Cork> and this will be window
[21:31:46] <Cork> (well not in a click event)
[21:31:56] <Cork> ?p @ amh345
[21:31:57] <bot-t> amh345, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:32:37] <amh345> i think im just going to revisit the autoresizing of text at a later date
[21:32:43] <Cork> booboonathan: how do you expect that code to animate spans when you bind a tags?
[21:33:38] <booboonathan> that's for other parts of the code
[21:33:46] <booboonathan> that code is taken from something else
[21:33:49] <booboonathan> the bit I'm talking about is
[21:34:03] <booboonathan>                             .delegate('a',eventOff,function(e){
[21:34:03] <booboonathan>                                 //relation is the id of the element,
[21:34:03] <booboonathan>                                 //and the class of related elements
[21:34:03] <booboonathan>                                 var relation    = $(this).attr('id');
[21:34:03] <booboonathan>                                 $(this).animate({
[21:34:04] <booboonathan>                                     marginLeft: '-100px',
[21:34:06] <booboonathan>                                     width: '150px'
[21:34:08] <booboonathan>                                   }, 200, function() {
[21:34:09] <Cork> ugg...
[21:34:10] <booboonathan>                                     });
[21:34:12] <booboonathan>                                 $('.hdd').show();
[21:34:14] <booboonathan>                                 animateElems('off',relation);
[21:34:18] <booboonathan>                                 return false;
[21:34:19] <Cork> don't paste code in the channel!!! T_T
[21:34:20] <booboonathan>                             })
[21:34:22] <booboonathan> mainly the $('.hdd').show()
[21:34:24] <booboonathan> yeah, it's horrible
[21:34:26] <booboonathan> but it sort of works
[21:34:31] <Cork> no
[21:34:47] <Cork> its just a huge mess and completly unredable
[21:35:09] <chjj> pasting 20 lines of code in irc is pure evil
[21:35:14] <booboonathan> sowwy
[21:35:16] <chjj> everyone needs to learn this
[21:35:41] <Cork> many code channels will ban you if you do...
[21:35:44] <booboonathan> yeah, 20 lines is pure evil, however 13 lines is just evil
[21:35:55] <booboonathan> alright, enough of the lectures :P
[21:36:03] <Cork> no anything more then 4-5 is pure evil
[21:36:14] <chjj> nah i would say the limit is 3
[21:36:15] <Cork> anything more then one is evil
[21:36:21] <Cork> nope single lines
[21:36:28] <chjj> and even if it is 3, just truncate it down to one line
[21:37:24] <booboonathan> okay, if i promise never to do it again, will you help me ^^
[21:39:46] <Cork> booboonathan: you want to show all .hdd elements thats a child of the current a tag?
[21:39:54] <smplstk> ?p @ booboonathan
[21:39:54] <Cork> or what is it your after?
[21:39:54] <bot-t> booboonathan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:40:03] <Cork> smplstk: he already did...
[21:40:06] <booboonathan> yeah Cork
[21:40:14] <smplstk> oh, and then he pasted it in the chan?
[21:40:19] <booboonathan> no smplstk
[21:40:26] <Cork> booboonathan: $(this).find('.hdd').show();
[21:40:30] <booboonathan> i pasted the snippet that was wrong in the code
[21:40:39] <smplstk> ah
[21:40:49] <booboonathan> CORK
[21:40:55] <booboonathan> YOU ARE A COMPLETE LEGEND!
[21:41:04] <booboonathan> so simple, yet so beautiful
[21:41:04] <booboonathan> :p
[21:41:26] <Cork> don't forget $('.hdd').hide() first
[21:41:39] <Cork> else you will show them all but never hide them
[21:41:44] <smplstk> store $( this ) as a var if you're using it more that once, also :|
[21:42:13] <Cork> ya, though its more for readability then speed
[21:42:25] <Cork> wrapping this in jquery is farly cheap
[21:42:40] <smplstk> ya
[21:42:49] <smplstk> just good practice, really.
[21:42:50] <Cork> doing queries is where you should REALLY cache
[21:43:48] <Cork> smplstk: the bigest cost might actually be gc :)
[21:45:10] <smplstk> gc?
[21:45:11] <bitwise_> i have two elements i like to basically fadeIn/Out while one fades out fade the other one in. but i think the mouseenter is firing when the new one fades in. basically i see the thing fade in then immediately disappear
[21:45:42] <bitwise_> seems like a common issue prob a good write up somewhere
[21:57:59] <coldhead> NOOOO BOT-T
[21:58:14] <tonyjcamp> bitwise_:  is this kinda what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/EvKrX/1/
[21:59:31] <bitwise_> inda tonyjcamp
[21:59:42] <bitwise_> but overlapping elements
[22:04:48] <tonyjcamp> bitwise_: http://jsfiddle.net/EvKrX/5/   ?
[22:08:29] <bitwise_> tonyjcamp:basically this http://jsfiddle.net/xHP3D/3/
[22:08:57] <tonyjcamp> ah
[22:10:16] <bitwise_> but somtimes im seeing a condition where stuff crosses wires
[22:10:27] <bitwise_> and things fade back to the off state
[22:12:47] <bitwise_> it seems sound.. not sure what the issue was
[22:14:55] <tonyjcamp> Cool. I'm not able to see it getting mixed up. Just randomly gets confused?
[22:17:04] <bitwise_> seems weird when they are images
[22:17:33] <tonyjcamp> ah
[22:18:58] <tonyjcamp> http://jsfiddle.net/xHP3D/3/  looks sweet, esp with the place kittens ;)
[22:20:03] <tonyjcamp> also, you don't need to fade the bottom element in or out.
[22:20:08] <tonyjcamp> only the top right?
[22:22:53] <tonyjcamp> Or just use http://jsfiddle.net/xHP3D/4/  but I remembering hearing that fadeToggle is a hooker… can't remember if that's true or not.
[22:26:00] <muzone> I'm trying to make this image cycle on hover like on http://www.tobi.com/women/lingerie using jQuery Cycle Lite: http://jsfiddle.net/qaFb2/ - But I'm unable to set the cycle speed, and the whole thing keeps on cycling after I remove my cursor from the image. Does anybody know how to fix this?
[22:34:51] <tonyjcamp> Who was asking about cycle lite again?
[22:35:01] <tonyjcamp> I cleared the screen :(
[22:38:17] <tonyjcamp> muzone: you there?
[22:39:12] <muzone> hey
[22:39:15] <muzone> that would be me tonyjcamp !
[22:39:18] <tonyjcamp> hey!
[22:39:19] <tonyjcamp> cool
[22:39:23] <tonyjcamp> http://jsfiddle.net/qaFb2/6/  is that what you want?
[22:39:55] <muzone> sorry no, i want it the other way around:-)
[22:40:11] <tonyjcamp> To start when you hover over it?
[22:40:15] <muzone> to cycle on hover, pause when not hovering
[22:40:17] <muzone> yeah
[22:41:43] <tonyjcamp> k
[22:43:48] <muzone> tonyjcamp: any idea what to do?
[22:44:13] <tonyjcamp> The trick is getting it to stop on the pic you're viewing when you mouse out right?
[22:44:36] <muzone> i think so yeah
[22:44:37] <tonyjcamp> You don't want it to reset to the beginning on mouse out, correct?
[22:44:43] <muzone> true, that is correct
[22:57:58] <ximmr> erm, isn't there smth like the php 'in_array' for javascript/jquery??
[22:58:47] <tonyjcamp> indexOf
[22:59:29] <tonyjcamp> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf  does this help?
[23:00:25] <j_wright> yeah, you might need to put that code in your page
[23:01:09] <ximmr> looks good at the first view, have to read it first, but thx :)
[23:02:18] <j_wright> not in IE < 9
[23:02:23] <muzone> tonyjcamp: so you have any clue about this one?
[23:02:31] <tonyjcamp> Well, it's tricky.
[23:02:42] <tonyjcamp> It's easy to get it to start on hover.
[23:03:04] <tonyjcamp> But getting it to pause on mouse leave… that's a different story.
[23:03:29] <muzone> yeah..
[23:04:00] <bitwise_> ~(arr.indexOf('foo')) ? 'has foo' : 'no foo'
[23:04:12] <rchavik> is there a good plugin that can do pivot table (other than https://github.com/janusschmidt/jquery.pivot) ?
[23:05:00] <bitwise_> ~['foo'].indexOf('foo') ? 'has foo' : 'no foo'
[23:05:27] <coldhead> mmm, readable
[23:05:35] <bobbobbins> anyone awake?
[23:05:59] <coldhead> its a big planet, buddy
[23:06:03] <coldhead> lotta time zones
[23:06:33] <bobbobbins> im having a jquery mobile issue...its giving me a b.replace is not a function error
[23:07:01] <muzone> I'm trying to get jQuery Cycle Lite to make this image cycle on hover and pause otherwise: http://jsfiddle.net/qaFb2/ - but why's it gotta be so hard? It's dead easy to make it pause on hover and cycle otherwise.
[23:08:09] <coldhead> bobbobbins: what is b? how are you triggering this error?
[23:08:46] <Cork> bitwise_: i would prob check with < 0 instead
[23:09:02] <bobbobbins> no idea, im not using a b...it happens when i navigate to a product page on my site...its something in the actual jquery mobile code that is returning the error
[23:09:36] <coldhead> got a live demo or something bobbobbins?
[23:09:51] <bobbobbins> http://www.healthyback.com
[23:10:08] <bobbobbins> i have it set to mobile right now, so you can click through to a product page, just browse by category or something until you get to one
[23:11:59] <CrazyTux[m]> Hey guys - I've a range slider - is there an easy way to access the values externally?
[23:12:16] <CrazyTux[m]> i.e. $('.slider').values[0] etc
[23:13:53] <JohnnyDavidson> Can you force a td to be a certain width?
[23:14:13] <JohnnyDavidson> I try setting one with only text in it to make it bigger, but it doesn't get bigger
[23:14:31] <JohnnyDavidson> It gets maybe a few pixels bigger, but after a certain point it doesn't go to what I set it to
[23:15:47] <JohnnyDavidson> Oh I know why
[23:16:00] <jQ_> hi all!
[23:16:14] <JohnnyDavidson> I had my table set to a certain width, which was limiting the amount I could set a td
[23:16:16] <Cork> CrazyTux[m]: i think its something like $('.slider').slider('option', 'values')
[23:16:54] <bobbobbins> it has something to do with data-collapsed=true
[23:18:31] <bobbobbins> i think i just need to update jquery
[23:22:35] <JohnnyDavidson> Anyone know why my animations are glitchy?
[23:22:58] <JohnnyDavidson> Like I just have a simple hover, where when I hover it expands, and then goes back down when I hover off
[23:23:26] <JohnnyDavidson> But for some reason like the starting of the animation isn't where it is supposed to be, so when I hover, it will autoamtically go to a different width before it starts the animation
[23:23:45] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: thank you!  That worked, found it in the documents finally, and thanks for the help
[23:23:48] <Cork> JohnnyDavidson: you need to clear old animations
[23:23:59] <JohnnyDavidson> How do I do that?
[23:24:50] <Cork> ?.stop @ JohnnyDavidson
[23:24:50] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[23:26:12] <JohnnyDavidson> Still glitching
[23:26:12] <Cork> JohnnyDavidson: and don't use range animations (+= 10), use fixed dimention animations, that way it always ends up at the correct size, even if the old animation was mid way
[23:27:25] <JohnnyDavidson> It doesn't have to do with stopping the animation
[23:27:40] <JohnnyDavidson> If I let it play out, it still jumps to a different spot before it starts the next one
[23:27:46] <JohnnyDavidson> Even though I have it set no where to do that
[23:31:04] <JohnnyDavidson> Well thanks for the help anyway
[23:31:05] <JohnnyDavidson> I got to go
[23:33:41] <This> Do you know if there's a way to make tab cycle trough form fields (after leaving last field to go back to first)?
[23:35:52] <Cork> This: sure delegate keypress
[23:37:09] <tonyjcamp> yo muzone , youstill around?
[23:37:21] <muzone> for sure tonyjcamp
[23:37:51] <muzone> just chilling, got this new dvd in the mail this morning, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-3EHaZVss
[23:38:01] <muzone> tonyjcamp: whats up?
[23:38:09] <tonyjcamp> Getting close
[23:38:15] <tonyjcamp> Do you NEED to use the lite version?
[23:38:16] <muzone> ah sweet!!
[23:38:21] <tonyjcamp> of the plugin?
[23:38:23] <muzone> yes
[23:38:35] <muzone> why not?
[23:40:03] <Cork> This: something like this $('form').delegate('input', 'keypress', function(event) { if(event.keyCode != 9) { return; } var next_field = $(this).nextAll('input').eq(0); if(next_field.length < 1) { next_field = $(this).closest('form').find('input:first'); } next_field.focus(); return false; } });
[23:40:18] <Cork> (untested)
[23:40:42] <This> k, thanks
[23:40:58] <Cork> hmm could prob shorten that one down...
[23:41:57] <Cork> This: this should prob work too $('form').delegate('input', 'keypress', function(event) { if(event.keyCode != 9) { return; } $(this).nextAll('input').and($(this).closest('form').find('input:first')).eq(0).focus(); return false; } });
[23:42:24] <Cork> s/and/add/
[23:44:56] <muzone> zdk: hey!
[23:45:28] <muzone> zdk: you work at startsiden? we used to buy ads from you guys
[23:45:32] <muzone> back in the day
[23:45:41] <muzone> good times man:-)
[23:46:45] <tonyjcamp> muzone: Just need to check if the slide show has already started playing, then resume the current slideshow on mouse enter.
[23:46:46] <tonyjcamp> http://jsfiddle.net/qaFb2/7/
[23:47:52] <muzone> tonyjcamp: doesnt seem to pause on mouseleave though
[23:48:04] <tonyjcamp> It is for me.
[23:48:19] <CrazyTux[m]> What am I doing wrong: https://gist.github.com/1202804
[23:48:34] <CrazyTux[m]> I simply want to iterate over that result set and append the values of each checkbox into an array
[23:49:09] <muzone> tonyjcamp: Seems it pauses when the mouse leaves the Result window, not the image
[23:49:25] <muzone> your code looks good though, def a major improvement!!
[23:49:29] * muzone pops the champagne
[23:49:34] <Cork> CrazyTux[m]: javascript doesn't allow [] setting
[23:49:42] <Cork> CrazyTux[m]: you need to use .push()
[23:49:44] <muzone> no wait, too early for that:-)
[23:49:56] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: I've tried that as well and it doesn't seem to do what I'm looking for
[23:50:13] <tonyjcamp> ah
[23:50:26] <tonyjcamp> easy enough. Just sent the mouse enter to be on the image.
[23:50:28] <tonyjcamp> not on the ul
[23:50:34] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: when I call $.param(query) the result is shape=X (not shape[]=X&shape[]=Y
[23:50:36] <muzone> cool
[23:50:41] <tonyjcamp> the containing ul takes up the full screen.
[23:50:50] <Cork> ...
[23:50:57] <Cork> ?.serialize @ CrazyTux[m]
[23:50:58] <bot-t> CrazyTux[m], .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[23:51:09] <muzone> yeah the resume current slideshow on mouse enter part though.. how to do that?
[23:52:46] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: Its not the form though itself that i'm looking to serialize .. just the specific 'query' object
[23:52:57] <tonyjcamp> Not sure, we can resume a paused slide show, but since we're starting the slideshow on mouse enter… it's being weird.
[23:53:34] <Cork> CrazyTux[m]: $('input:checkbox[name="shapes[]"]:checked').serialize()
[23:53:56] <CrazyTux[m]> ah
[23:53:58] <Cork> though you don't need to use :checked,
[23:54:12] <Cork> CrazyTux[m]: works by default $('input:checkbox[name="shapes[]"]').serialize()
[23:54:56] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: any way I can tie that back into query.shapes (object property)?
[23:55:13] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: because I'm doing a $.param(query) where query also gets other parts of data
[23:55:22] <Cork> CrazyTux[m]: query.shapes = $('input:checkbox[name="shapes[]"]:checked').serializeArray()
[23:55:42] <Cork> CrazyTux[m]: the thing is, why are you using $.param?
[23:55:53] <Cork> if your using ajax, it does it by default
[23:56:09] <Cork> just give it your object and it will generate a queriy string of it
[23:57:15] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: hmmmm
[23:57:22] <CrazyTux[m]> Cork: I'm using .getJSON
[23:58:02] <Cork> $.getJSON(<url>, { shapes: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] }
[23:58:07] <Cork> );
[23:58:26] <Cork> should give you the query string your after
