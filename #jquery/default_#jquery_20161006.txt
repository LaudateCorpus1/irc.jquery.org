[02:00:36] <jak2000> hi all
[02:05:01] <jak2000> any ppl alive?
[02:09:44] <SteveDonJon> jak2000, What's up
[02:09:57] <jak2000> you know about ajax for send a picture/image?
[02:10:03] <jak2000> enctype: 'multipart/form-data',
[02:10:11] <jak2000> for upload a pic
[02:10:43] <Cork> jak2000: i recommend you stop with the 20 questions and show what you want to have help with instead
[02:10:49] <Cork> else you won't get much help
[02:10:50] <SteveDonJon> I agree
[02:10:56] <SteveDonJon> jak2000,  Jsfiddle
[02:11:04] <SteveDonJon> http://jsfiddle.net/
[02:11:42] <Cork> (the worst one is to ask if anyone is here, just ask the question if you want help; don't force ppl to answer you to know if they have the answer)
[02:12:10] <Cork> cause if ppl are a bit busy it is a grate way to get no answer
[02:12:17] <jak2000> ok
[02:19:36] <hellojq> Why will not localstorage save: https://jsfiddle.net/hjLodm24/3/
[02:20:15] <Cork> hellojq: jsfiddle use sandbox
[02:20:23] <Cork> it isn't a good place to demo storage solutions
[02:21:02] <Cork> except for that it should work
[02:21:16] <SteveDonJon> hellojq, Usually just use jsfiddle for the code and point my files to a server as it will not store data
[02:21:30] <SteveDonJon> other than the code itself :p
[02:21:37] <Cork> SteveDonJon: that won't change
[02:21:40] <hellojq> heres the update: https://jsfiddle.net/hjLodm24/4/
[02:21:42] <Cork> opps that won't work
[02:21:54] <hellojq> well, I just wanna store this thing
[02:21:55] <hellojq>  =)
[02:22:11] <Cork> the problem is you have <iframe name="result" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-modals"> <--
[02:22:18] <Cork> this doesn't allow storage
[02:22:27] <Cork> hellojq: you can't on jsfiddle
[02:22:30] <SteveDonJon> Cork Right
[02:22:42] <Cork> fiddle.jshell.net can't use cookies or localstorage
[02:22:59] <Cork> might be worth notifying the developer
[02:23:08] <Cork> cause it is quite a weird limitation to add
[02:23:13] <lenswipee> I am the developer
[02:23:21] <SteveDonJon> Are you now
[02:23:28] <Cork> hellojq: also $(this).addClass('active') = localStorage.setItem("save"); won't work
[02:23:52] <Cork> hellojq: $(this).addClass('active', localStorage.getItem("save")); is what you want
[02:23:53] <lenswipee> SteveDonJon: Yes
[02:24:14] <hellojq> this seems to store in jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/james2doyle/jC9ms/
[02:24:40] <Cork> hmm
[02:24:44] <SteveDonJon> lenswipee,  I'm happy for you :p
[02:25:18] <Cork> hellojq: nope
[02:25:20] <Cork> "SecurityError: The operation is insecure."
[02:25:29] <lenswipee> SteveDonJon: Okey Dokey
[02:25:35] <hellojq> what I wanna do is to store class "active"
[02:25:50] <Cork> hellojq: use a place where you can use localstorage :/
[02:25:55] <Cork> like i said
[02:25:56] <SteveDonJon> lenswipee, Artichoke
[02:25:59] <SteveDonJon> :D
[02:26:28] <SteveDonJon> hellojq, You can store class active but you cannot do it with JSFiddle as it does not allow you to store those settings
[02:26:28] <lenswipee> SteveDonJon: Okey Dokey
[02:27:09] <SteveDonJon> hellojq, Put your saved settings on a server somewhere and use for the example
[02:27:26] <Cork> well you would have to move everything
[02:27:32] <Cork> not just the script
[02:28:15] <SteveDonJon> Right
[02:28:17] <hellojq> ok
[02:28:29] <SteveDonJon> Alright my night is at its end have a good day guys
[02:28:32] <lenswipee> I have disabled local storage to make is fiddle better.
[02:28:56] <Cork> lenswipee: better in what way??
[02:29:10] <SteveDonJon> Probably more secure
[02:29:20] <Cork> ya, but that is more secure, not better
[02:29:47] <Cork> as it makes jsfiddle unusable for some test cases
[02:29:48] <SteveDonJon> Better if we can keep using it because it's more secure and hasn't gone down :p
[02:30:15] <Cork> localstorage is stored in the client, so it isn't really a server reliability problem
[02:30:35] <Cork> (not saying it isn't for a good reason, just not sure what)
[02:30:37] <lenswipee> Cork: Security in part. We take security seriously.
[02:30:38] <SteveDonJon> Right
[02:30:53] <Cork> lenswipee: you're thinking about leaking localstorage between fiddles?
[02:31:01] <Cork> cause that is about the only problem i can think of
[02:31:01] <Duikb00t> Good morning everyone
[02:31:22] <Cork> lenswipee: also, ya and that you should (good work on the site btw)
[02:31:56] <Duikb00t> I would like to setup a 'form-wizard' where I can switch with buttons
[02:32:06] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/ys2qf0zx/2/  I currently made that start point
[02:32:28] <SteveDonJon> Duikb00t, So you click the button and it brings up step 2 ?
[02:32:34] <Duikb00t> Exactly.
[02:32:39] <lenswipee> Cork: For security reasons it is not wise for me to discuss them in any detail.
[02:32:41] <SteveDonJon> Just hide the element by ID and show the next element ?
[02:32:50] <Cork> O_o
[02:32:51] <Duikb00t> Well I was just going to ask
[02:32:54] <Cork> ok...
[02:33:07] <Duikb00t> to achieve it without doing that D:
[02:33:07] <SteveDonJon> change the display using CSS Selectors
[02:33:19] <Duikb00t> nth-child you mean?
[02:33:20] <SteveDonJon> Duikb00t, Then how do you expect to do it ?
[02:33:28] <Duikb00t> As dynamic as possible
[02:33:48] <Duikb00t> maybe with a step variable to increment it or something.
[02:33:57] <SteveDonJon> Eh have the forms in one page floating next to eachother and slide  and/or fade them in with click of button
[02:36:40] <beasty_> Cork ! o/
[02:36:44] <Cork> o/
[02:36:59] <Duikb00t> I have them now in 1 page already it's btw 1 form with multipel fieldsets
[02:39:24] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/ys2qf0zx/3/
[02:39:27] <Duikb00t> so far so good
[02:39:51] <SteveDonJon> Duikb00t, Yup
[02:40:16] <SteveDonJon> Duikb00t, Except I wouldn't make it refresh the buttons :p
[02:40:42] <Duikb00t> What you mean exact?
[02:41:22] <SteveDonJon> Duikb00t, When you push the 'Next' button it also hides/shows the prev/next button
[02:41:35] <Duikb00t> oohhh
[02:41:38] <Duikb00t> I should have 'controls only once'
[02:41:39] <SteveDonJon> :)
[02:42:00] <lenswipee> FYI. Jquery may no longer be relevant as browsers improve on standardising behaviour. People will likely revert back to pure JavaScript. Many experts predict this to happen within a few years.
[02:42:15] <Duikb00t> Was that pointing to me?
[02:42:47] <SteveDonJon> Yessir
[02:43:20] <Duikb00t> You mean to re-write it in plain-js or using any react/angular/knockout shizzle because jquery and this channel will be dead in a few years?
[02:43:56] <SteveDonJon> Duikb00t, basically what he's saying yeah
[02:44:43] <Duikb00t> Let's assume wiritng it in ... knockout will it be harder?
[02:44:51] <Duikb00t> the only functionality I need is those step thing :D
[02:45:07] <SteveDonJon> Duikb00t,  depends on how your brains grasps new concepts
[02:45:16] <SteveDonJon> What is easier to most can be harder to the individual
[02:45:41] <SteveDonJon> But if you never do what you cannot do, you will never be more than you are.
[02:45:45] <SteveDonJon> So give it a go :D
[02:45:57] <Duikb00t> that's well-formed.
[02:47:04] <Duikb00t> actually this is what I need, but everyone here knows that already: http://codepen.io/tommymarshall/pen/yyMOzj
[02:47:37] <SteveDonJon> Duikb00t,  Well you have the code then :p
[02:48:04] <Duikb00t> other things corssing my brains right now..
[02:48:24] <Duikb00t> but i'll try it.
[02:49:06] <lenswipee> There will not be a jquery channel because it would have gone out of fashion.
[02:54:47] <Duikb00t> hmm http://kylemitofsky.com/jquery.multistep/javascripts/jquery.multistep.js
[03:28:00] <jak2000> cant use $.ajax   with multipart?
[03:51:21] <Cork> jak2000: possibly, if you want to upload files you need to use formData
[03:51:34] <Cork> jak2000: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FormData
[03:51:38] <Cork> except for that, no
[04:39:14] <prillian5> I have this little script: http://dpaste.com/0T2YEV5    but the regexpr for href returns me an error:
[04:39:19] <prillian5> jquery.min.js:2 Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: /#news
[04:39:45] <prillian5> whats wrong with it, ?
[04:40:37] <prillian5> each href wich starts with "/#" should be do a smooth scroll in the page
[04:40:53] <Cork> it isn't regexp
[04:41:07] <Cork> it is the selector parser failing at reading the string
[04:41:33] <prillian5> Cork: ok, but why?
[04:41:42] <Cork> are you sure that selector is correct?
[04:41:58] <Cork> looks like $('a[href^="#"]') is what you would want
[04:42:20] <prillian5> If I put this script in browser-console it returns the one Tag I have in the page:
[04:42:34] <Cork> ah
[04:42:38] <prillian5> <a href="/#news">Preise</a>
[04:42:46] <Cork> is this script generated in server script?
[04:43:08] <Cork> meaning is it ex generated by php or something like that
[04:43:25] <prillian5> you mean the html page where this tag inside?
[04:43:33] <Cork> no the js script
[04:43:55] <prillian5> It lay inside of init.js on the server.
[04:44:14] <Cork> basically, the point i'm trying to make is i think the server is doing something with this and you're actually executing something else
[04:44:19] <Cork> cause i can't reproduce the error
[04:45:10] <Cork> prillian5: https://jsfiddle.net/nggq6xzu/
[04:46:50] <prillian5> You're right If I add this console.log to my page it also returns "Preise"
[04:46:59] <km4> guys better use after or inserAfter ?
[04:47:16] <Cork> km4: insertAfter uses after, so it is the same thing
[04:47:26] <Cork> only difference is what element you run it on
[04:47:49] <Cork> $(source).insertAfter(target) $(target).after(source)
[04:48:04] <prillian5> Wait, I see...
[04:48:12] <Cork> personally i prefer after, as it is how the dom actually works
[04:48:36] <Cork> (insertNode)
[04:48:36] <km4> ok right :)
[04:48:51] <prillian5> It got the attr of href, and use this as selector... but a selector with / is wrong.
[04:49:02] <Cork> ah, ya
[04:49:02] <prillian5> thank you Cork for helping hands
[04:49:33] <Cork> prillian5: i would recommend trying to remove the / from the link
[04:49:40] <prillian5> Can I do an OR reqeust for an selector? like href= # or /# ?
[04:49:45] <Cork> i don't see why you need it there
[04:49:56] <Cork> prillian5: kinda
[04:50:03] <prillian5> It is part of a cms. A pitty is... it doesn't work without :(
[04:50:16] <Cork> $('[href^="/#"],[href^="#"]')
[04:50:26] <prillian5> ah, great. thank you
[04:50:32] <Catgroove> So I have this table using .sortable, and I want to group certain rows together, so when you move one you move the other. I found an example online achieving this: https://jsfiddle.net/sgpqruy4/. In this example "banana" is the sticky one and always follow it's previous sibling. However, I also want to make that connection unbreakable, so Pear is always connected to banana. You can just replace Pear with whatever you want atm.
[04:50:35] <Cork> prillian5: also you prob want to use delegation if you have more then one of those
[04:50:56] <prillian5> what you mean with delegation?
[04:51:49] <Cork> prillian5: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[04:53:16] <Catgroove> That explanation sucked, but essentially I want to disable inserting anything before a sticky itemaonly before it's previous sibling.
[05:43:26] <froyo1> Does .find() only look for immediate children?
[05:43:52] <aspo> hey there
[05:44:00] <aspo> pls help me out w my sidebar http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LRZqJQ
[05:44:08] <aspo> the animation seems to be laggy
[05:44:11] <Cork> froyo1: no
[05:44:17] <Cork> .children() is for that
[05:45:38] <Cork> aspo: that is prob a question for #css
[05:45:51] <aspo> silent af
[05:46:28] <aspo> also css isn't helping much
[05:47:05] <aspo> because it can't animate display:none
[05:52:09] <Catgroove> Is there a way to prevent dropping after a certain item using jquery ui sortable?
[07:32:06] <anli_> I want to be able to clear a jquery ui datepicker thats readonly="readonly"
[07:32:22] <anli_> Is manual work the only way? (creating a clear button)
[07:49:01] <Cork> anli_: set the field to val('')
[07:49:41] <anli_> Yes, I know, but what I hoped for was that jquery ui datepicker could do it for me
[07:51:22] <Ice_Strike2> D you prefer to render html from server side or json to render html on the client side?
[07:51:24] <Ice_Strike2> for ajax
[07:52:34] <Cork> Ice_Strike2: depends on the situation
[07:53:07] <Cork> if you do it client side you need to use something for templating (as you don't want to keep html in the script)
[07:54:23] <Ice_Strike2> Cork like for creating via client or server. <tr> <td> ... </td> </tr>
[07:55:10] <Cork> Ice_Strike2: i get that, what i meant with situation
[07:55:19] <Ice_Strike2> I could put html in json like returnval.output
[07:55:20] <Cork> is like if there is something else that will use the api too
[07:55:29] <Cork> and if that will use the same markup or not
[07:55:34] <Cork> else client side makes sense
[07:56:08] <Cork> but if you don't, i would prob go with creating it server side
[07:56:23] <suexec_> Any way of counting how many children() do NOT have a certain class?
[07:56:31] <Ice_Strike2> Thanks Cork
[07:56:49] <Cork> suexec_: .children(':not(.class-name)').length
[07:57:18] <Cork> alternatively .children().not('.class-name').length
[08:16:51] <suexec_> Cork, will a .children() selector traverse through sub-children as well .. or just next() level ?
[08:18:33] <AdamPDotty> .children() is not .find()
[08:18:38] <suexec_> nvm
[08:18:41] <suexec_> I fixed it :)
[08:18:43] <suexec_> thanks Cork!
[08:21:08] <Cork> heh the same question in the time span of 3h interesting...
[09:04:37] <phunkren_> Afternoon all. How can I get my rule to evaluate a regex using jquery validate?
[09:05:33] <rjCousineau> Hi, Can anyone recommend a lightbox / modal box plugin?
[09:06:51] <phunkren_> I want to use jquery validate to make sure there are no characters (a-z) in the field. I currently have:    jquery(form).validate({ rules: { num : { required: true, minlength: 10  } });
[09:07:06] <phunkren_> what is the option for evaluating a regex?
[09:07:41] <Cork> phunkren_: i'm quite sure it has a match option
[09:07:49] <rjCousineau> phunkren_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/280759/jquery-validate-how-to-add-a-rule-for-regular-expression-validation
[09:09:31] <phunkren_> Thanks
[09:24:30] <phunkren_> Cork rjCousineau How does this look http://pastebin.com/eBuq3PYi
[09:24:57] <Cork> hmm you should be able to user regex without a function if i remember correctly
[09:30:28] <Cork> ah, they've moved it out into a plugin now
[09:30:37] <Cork> its part of additional-methods.js
[09:31:05] <Cork> http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.validation/1.15.1/additional-methods.js
[09:32:29] <Cork> phunkren_: you might want to make it a value option so you can change the regex without having to create a separate function
[09:32:35] <Cork> but ya, that should work
[09:33:10] <Cork> phunkren_: i would prob just copy the "pattern" function from additional-methods
[09:33:24] <phunkren_> How do I call the phonevalidation function in the validator rules then?
[09:33:39] <Cork> phonevalidation: true
[09:42:27] <z1haze_work> I have a method firing on mouseover when i mouseover a dig containing an img, and all the method does is set a variable != variable.. and inside the div i have 2 images, one shows if variable = true, the other if false.. my issue is when im hovering the element the event is firing a bunch of times causing the images to swap back and forth very quic
[09:42:27] <z1haze_work> ky.. what could I be doing wrong?
[09:43:31] <Cork> z1haze_work: you prob want to use mouseenter instead of mouseover
[09:43:40] <Cork> z1haze_work: also, why not just use :hover and css?
[09:43:52] <Cork> or at most a class and css background-images
[09:45:29] <z1haze_work> i dunno, im more wondering why the mouseenter event is firing numerous times when it hasnt even left the container it entered
[09:46:11] <Cork> z1haze_work: mouseOVER fires when you point directly at the element (not counting its children)
[09:46:32] <Cork> so when you show/hide the child img tags you will momentarly point at the parent element
[09:46:43] <Duikb00t> so hmm if I have on the 'same level ' <fieldset>.... <fieldset>...  <button>
[09:46:44] <Cork> resulting in the event fiering again
[09:46:50] <Duikb00t> how can I select the first fieldset ?
[09:46:54] <Duikb00t> find?
[09:46:59] <Cork> siblings
[09:47:01] <Cork> or children
[09:47:04] <Duikb00t> oh not find
[09:47:07] <Cork> depending on what element you start with
[09:49:22] <Duikb00t> I click on the latest butotn
[09:49:30] <Duikb00t> and I start at the first fieldset 'visible'
[09:49:40] <Duikb00t> I want not to go to the second on button click
[09:50:37] <z1haze_work> using mouse enter on the parent of the imgs
[09:52:50] <phunkren_> NO luck with that regex Cork :(
[09:53:05] <phunkren_> I added phoneValidation to rules and messages
[09:53:28] <phunkren_> Set it to true in rules, and added a default string in messages
[09:53:50] <phunkren_> Now I am receiving the following error: jquery.validate.rules.checkout.js:337 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[09:53:58] <Duikb00t> Cork:  I've setup a small dummy https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2tpg27Lb/
[09:54:12] <phunkren_> 337:   phoneValidation: Venda.Validate.msg.house_num
[09:54:54] <Duikb00t> * https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2tpg27Lb/ small edit
[09:55:12] <Cork> z1haze_work: why not just do https://jsfiddle.net/nggq6xzu/1/
[09:55:52] <z1haze_work> was using js cause i had a issue where no all images had a rollover
[09:56:05] <z1haze_work> but i dynamically added a class to check if the image has a rollove rbefore applying the css, so im good now thank you
[09:56:33] <Guest25734> Hey guys. I'm trying to create a non linear step slider and I'm rewriting the slider's step value every time the slide event fires(when the slider's value gets over certain limit the step changes). But during that step change moment it adds additional step to the slider's value. For example if step is 1000 and from 10 000 I want step to be 5000 then when I go from 9000 to 10 000 the slider jumps to 11 000 and from then on the step
[10:06:31] <Cork> Duikb00t: i would recommend something like this https://jsfiddle.net/2tpg27Lb/5/
[10:06:38] <arup_r> Hi, I am getting error when executing this $options.filter(function (index, element) { return $(element).data('provider') == provider_id}).unshift('<option value=""></option>'). Error is
[10:06:40] <arup_r> caught TypeError: $options.filter(...).unshift is not a function
[10:06:53] <arup_r> so how do I add that to the begining?
[10:07:31] <Cork> arup_r: before()
[10:07:38] <arup_r> ok
[10:08:04] <Cork> if you want it in the dom that is
[10:08:30] <Cork> if you just want it in the selector you would have to use splice
[10:08:52] <arup_r> it is not adding
[10:08:58] <Ice_Strike2> !pb
[10:09:58] <arup_r> Cork: it is the whole code https://jsfiddle.net/sgjf3e3u/ . Not adding the empty to the begining
[10:10:09] <arup_r> empty option*
[10:10:47] <Ice_Strike2> Is there alternative approach for rendering tr/td ? see https://jsfiddle.net/m0suvxhv/
[10:11:00] <Ice_Strike2> It is a bit messy/ugly in js
[10:12:27] <arup_r> I just want to add it to the begining of the result returned by filter() function
[10:12:59] <Duikb00t> insane Cork :D you are so fast :D haha
[10:13:04] <Duikb00t> but really that's exactly what I need :D
[10:14:22] <arup_r> but I solved it otherway
[10:14:24] <arup_r> :)
[10:14:28] <arup_r> thanks anyway
[10:27:55] <Ice_Strike2> Is there alternative approach for rendering tr/td ? see https://jsfiddle.net/m0suvxhv/
[10:27:57] <Ice_Strike2> It is a bit messy/ugly in js
[10:31:54] <gmurop> Ice_Strike2: Yes, you could create your HTML template and render it using mustachejs https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
[10:32:07] <taplar> ^ i was fixing to suggest handlebars
[10:37:03] <taplar> or if you don't want to bring in another library, it's fairly easy to write your own that just uses replaces
[10:37:17] <taplar> just won't have the context support, looping, and what not
[10:37:41] <CssNo0b> Is freecodecamp nice?
[10:38:20] <gmurop> taplar: Why would you go with handlebars instead of mustache, what is the difference? And you are right, if is just a simple template could be used just replace
[10:38:23] <Ice_Strike2> gmurop Hmm interesting. How would you use mustache for my example in the jsfiddle ?
[10:38:46] <taplar> gmurop: dunno, never used mustache.  i tried hb first.
[10:38:58] <taplar> one is built on top of the other afaik
[10:39:30] <gmurop> taplar: "Handlebars is largely compatible with Mustache templates. In most cases it is possible to swap out Mustache with Handlebars and continue using your current templates. " from the handlebars docs
[10:39:39] <taplar> ya
[10:42:35] <taplar> random people comparing the two: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10555820/what-are-the-differences-between-mustache-js-and-handlebars-js
[10:42:38] <Ice_Strike2> mustache better?
[10:48:04] <gmurop> Ice_Strike2: It would be something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/w3ru6uxe/1/
[10:50:08] <Ice_Strike2> gmurop Wow, I like it. Thank you.
[10:51:01] <gmurop> Ice_Strike2: You're welcome bro
[10:51:02] <Ice_Strike2> gmurop What if you pass spefic key to  Mustache.render(tmpl, device); ?
[10:51:32] <Ice_Strike2> For example, device.name from json response, but replacing to device.title instead after json reponse?
[10:51:46] <Ice_Strike2> and I have {{title}}
[10:52:05] <gmurop> Ice_Strike2: You pass an object, si you could just do this: Mustache.render(tmpl, {name: "your name",  description: "your description"});
[10:52:15] <Ice_Strike2> Lovely
[10:52:16] <Ice_Strike2> Thanks!
[10:52:34] <Ice_Strike2> Have you tried Handlebars?
[10:54:35] <gmurop> Ice_Strike2: No I haven't, but maybe later I'll give a try
[10:55:20] <taplar> i can provide a page that does as an example, if you like
[10:56:48] <Ice_Strike2> taplar Sure :)
[10:57:02] <taplar> http://hiddenworld.taplar.com/dev/
[10:57:25] <Ice_Strike2> Ah cool.
[10:57:33] <taplar> the menus and the results are built with handlebars
[10:58:03] <taplar> if you look at the hiddenworld.js file you can see the build*Menu functions and what not that do it
[10:58:12] <Ice_Strike2> Ah I see.
[10:58:22] <taplar> might be a little hard to read.  I did try to make them readable, but they are pretty modular
[10:58:33] <taplar> hopefully not too bad though, :)
[10:59:16] <taplar> to see the templates you'll have to view the page source.  the inspector will not show them
[11:52:01] <plamb__> tfw your jquery breaks with no console msg
[11:52:17] <robertmaxrees> how'd it break?
[11:52:41] <plamb__> i added an errorPlacement:  rule to jquery.validate
[11:53:43] <plamb__> function(error, element)
[11:53:51] <plamb__> element is the element the error throws on right?
[11:53:54] <taplar> *blinks* wow, sudden convo spawn
[11:54:16] <robertmaxrees> so you question is for jquery validate, not jquery?
[11:54:27] <plamb__> technically yes
[11:54:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:54:41] <plamb__> not even sure i have a question since i dont know whats broken
[11:54:44] <plamb__> just complaining
[11:54:52] <taplar> *venting
[11:54:54] <taplar> ;)
[11:55:09] <robertmaxrees> "Customize placement of created error labels. First argument: The created error label as a jQuery object. Second argument: The invalid element as a jQuery object."
[11:55:24] <plamb__> yep
[11:55:31] <plamb__> exactly what i thought
[11:55:49] <robertmaxrees> from https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/
[11:58:19] <plamb__> i wish it threw some error when it selected no element
[11:58:37] <robertmaxrees> that's part of the magic of jquery - it doesn't do that on purpose.
[11:58:44] <plamb__> why?
[11:59:02] <robertmaxrees> because errors halt execution and break the rest of the script.
[11:59:39] <plamb__> there wouldnt be a way to print an error to the console without breaking execution?
[11:59:41] <robertmaxrees> though you probably don't want an error on select.
[11:59:58] <robertmaxrees> you know there's a way to test for existence already, yeah?
[12:11:55] <sharpy35> hey guys, has some of you ever worked with parallax.js and can help me out with a question?
[12:12:16] <robertmaxrees> you can try asking the channel anyway and see if we can help :)
[12:13:53] <sharpy35> this is the code i am having: https://gist.github.com/adrianraeuchle/0e3e85b8602f7142d3b9749317a297df the parallax effect itself is working and showing the image in a 3d effect. the thing is that when i scroll down sometimes the div has the transparent background for a few pixels and not the image
[12:15:24] <sharpy35> i just cant figure out why
[12:15:31] <robertmaxrees> why not make a fiddle?
[12:15:49] <robertmaxrees> just update https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/n0fftbna/
[12:16:19] <sharpy35> thanks robertmaxrees: will try to
[12:17:09] <sharpy35> i will send u a screenthsot its easy :)
[12:17:11] <sharpy35> easier
[12:18:33] <taplar> heh
[12:18:50] <taplar> debugging screenshots, fun fun fun
[12:20:48] <sharpy35> https://postimg.org/image/cchtjrnf7/
[12:21:07] <sharpy35> this is the effect. sorry i cant get the fiddle to work properly ^^
[12:24:42] <sharpy35> sorry i just hope someone knows what i mean and what the problem is ^
[12:25:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:25:24] <robertmaxrees> i can't see code in a screenshot.
[12:25:47] <robertmaxrees> also: static screenshot image for something that requires interaction.
[12:41:09] <dglambert> yo
[12:42:11] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[12:42:20] <dglambert> I'm wondering about calling a $.post off a hijacked <form> but with out actually having to manually ad the data back
[12:42:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:42:52] <dglambert> sorry, let me just write a fiddle
[12:46:36] <dglambert> https://jsfiddle.net/tup6asu8/
[12:46:39] <dglambert> Sorry
[12:46:58] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue you're having?
[12:47:29] <dglambert> My question is there a way to just assume all the inputs as data for the post()
[12:47:44] <dglambert> Rather than having to include them as my second argument
[12:47:44] <robertmaxrees> on you mean instead of selecting everything manually?
[12:47:49] <dglambert> yes
[12:48:07] <dglambert> Because, I want to make this submit() function more extensible and use it on some other forms now
[12:48:12] <robertmaxrees> afaik no, but you can easily just serialize.
[12:48:25] <robertmaxrees> or serializeArray
[12:48:53] <dglambert> So another form I will be using with this, will for example not have an input TripID but maybe BrandID
[12:48:59] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:49:08] <robertmaxrees> you just use serialize or serializeArray against the form.
[12:49:13] <dglambert> ok?
[12:49:19] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting lost?
[12:49:25] <dglambert> on serialize
[12:49:33] <robertmaxrees> it's a jquery method.
[12:49:52] <dglambert> but what am I serialzing, all the inputs?
[12:49:56] <robertmaxrees> the form.
[12:50:05] <robertmaxrees> check the docs, yo.
[12:50:10] <robertmaxrees> they esdxplain both pretty clearly :)
[12:50:39] <dglambert> ok I'll check it out, thanks
[12:51:27] <dglambert> got it, didn't realize serialize specifically was used on forms
[12:51:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  both of those methods are.
[13:04:42] <Ice_Strike2> var inputs = $( this ).serialize();
[13:04:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:04:56] <Ice_Strike2> How to clear all the fields from inputs?
[13:05:14] <robertmaxrees> you mean reset the form?
[13:05:17] <Ice_Strike2> Yea
[13:05:21] <dglambert> just finishing coding it now, testing
[13:05:23] <robertmaxrees> this.reset()
[13:05:27] <Ice_Strike2> Hmm.
[13:05:31] <Ice_Strike2> Never knoew this.
[13:05:36] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset
[13:05:39] <taplar> do you truely mean reset or clear?
[13:05:48] <taplar> cause reset will change it back to original value, which may not have been empty
[13:05:53] <taplar> iirc
[13:06:01] <robertmaxrees> ^ troof
[13:06:06] <decx> funny tidbit, you can override the reset method with an element that has the id reset
[13:06:22] <Ice_Strike2> taplar Oh, clear.
[13:06:33] <Ice_Strike2> val("")
[13:07:08] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, too.
[13:07:41] <Ice_Strike2> Yes but with var inputs = $( this ).serialize(); ?
[13:07:58] <Ice_Strike2> I am guessing I have to use filter or each
[13:08:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:08:18] <robertmaxrees> you can't from the return value of serialize.
[13:08:30] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find(':input').each()
[13:08:41] <Ice_Strike2> inputs has names of input
[13:08:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:10:01] <Ice_Strike2> I might as well remove .serialize(); and and do $(thisForm).find('input[name=name]').val('')
[13:10:22] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, too.
[13:10:26] <robertmaxrees> but that'll target one element.
[13:10:50] <Ice_Strike2> I know.
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> so you want to reset one input?  or all?
[13:11:48] <Ice_Strike2> All :)
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> then just use .find('input') if you just have inputs.
[13:12:20] <Ice_Strike2> good idea :)
[14:12:02] * taplar twiddles thumbs
[14:12:05] <robertmaxrees> yep
[14:23:18] <BenMerkley> looking for some help, trying to run code on some checkboxes and then rerun the original code following it currently works when i click it twice if anyone has an  idea i would love to hear it http://pastebin.com/zSt3FHv2
[14:23:43] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> what is this trying to do?
[14:24:03] <BenMerkley> its supposed to make the checkboxes like radio buttons
[14:24:09] <taplar> ^^^
[14:24:10] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:24:12] <taplar> why not use radios?
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> you'll end up confusing your end users otherwise.
[14:24:59] <BenMerkley> They dont look like actual checkboxes, and i cant change the markup to be radio buttons
[14:25:23] <Yosi> 0.o
[14:25:38] <taplar> use click() on the raw Element, instead of trigger('click') then
[14:26:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/brx7tcna/
[14:26:17] <robertmaxrees> just do this instead.
[14:28:54] <BenMerkley> robertmaxrees: works great except for wheni click the box it unchecks it,
[14:29:11] <taplar> which is the expected ui for a checkbox
[14:29:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:29:20] <robertmaxrees> so you want to prevent unchecking?
[14:29:21] <taplar> err, ux
[14:29:25] <BenMerkley> ill give you that  taplar
[14:29:31] <newbieBr> I'm trying to input some data to an input through firebug console, but, somehow, the input is able to change his value but it isn't visible for user and so, it's not working so well. I tried using simple statements as $input.click, $input.focus and then $input.value...
[14:29:43] <BenMerkley> or just if its clicked again re set it
[14:30:36] <newbieBr> It looks that the input only recognize change once I've clicked (mouse) on it. Does anyone know a workaround for this behavior?
[14:30:52] <robertmaxrees> newbieBr what would you rather have happen?
[14:31:57] <robertmaxrees> BenMerkley one sec
[14:32:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/brx7tcna/5/
[14:32:26] <robertmaxrees> there.
[14:32:27] <newbieBr> robertmaxrees: there is a dynamic behavior for this input. The normal behavior is as soon keys are pressed, queries are executed bringing results... (just like google search does)
[14:32:56] <BenMerkley> robertmaxrees++
[14:33:21] <BenMerkley> just had a conversation with a coworker saying you help all the time!! thanks a bunch
[14:33:39] <robertmaxrees> hah, apparently my reputation precedes me.
[14:33:46] <taplar> i was going to suggest https://jsfiddle.net/brx7tcna/6/
[14:34:00] <robertmaxrees> that's another way do do it.
[14:36:51] <taplar> newbieBr: so your changing the value of an input field that has an on change or on input handler that does auto complete logic?
[14:37:38] <newbieBr> taplar: yes, something like that. It's exactly what happens when typing on google search input
[14:37:49] <robertmaxrees> so you want a handler that runs on input?
[14:38:17] <taplar> i'm assuming he's changing it logically with val() and expecting the handlers to fire
[14:38:29] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('input')
[14:38:29] <robertmaxrees> boom
[14:38:52] <robertmaxrees> even better
[14:38:53] <newbieBr> I was trying to do something like Selenium does with automated tests
[14:39:07] <robertmaxrees> abstract out the autocomplete and other logic and just call it directly.
[14:39:16] * taplar holds up a cross
[14:41:04] <rjCousineau> I have a weird jQuery UI sortable bug where on the first drag, I loose my table column widths, but on the second drag, it maintains the column widths..
[14:41:37] <rjCousineau> but only if it's a different item
[14:42:10] <newbieBr> I think that .trigger() don't work
[14:42:47] <robertmaxrees> newbieBr just do the abstraction.  it's cleaner :)
[14:42:58] <taplar> it may be bound to something other than input, like keydown or keyup.  may have to experiment
[14:43:08] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:44:41] <newbieBr> hm... There are like 6 eventlistener on this input... click(), keydown(), keyup()
[14:44:44] <newbieBr> But I'll try
[14:44:52] <robertmaxrees> newbieBr look at the actual code yo.
[14:44:57] <robertmaxrees> see which one runs the autocomplete.
[14:48:51] <taplar> i wonder if there are unit tests to go along with this integration test, :D
[14:48:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:49:38] <robertmaxrees> https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7rbPDRHIHwbmcOBy/giphy.gif
[14:50:02] <taplar> lol
[14:50:16] <robertmaxrees> there's another one that's the opposite one.
[14:51:34] <robertmaxrees> https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYSpvx4pnsoMNz2/giphy.gif
[14:51:35] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[14:51:58] <taplar> nice
[14:52:36] <taplar> i still like https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonnyradio.com%2Fwhat-the-customer-actually-wanted.jpg&f=1
[14:52:57] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:54:10] <BenMerkley> robertmaxrees: http://dev-canada-games.pantheonsite.io/en/sports sadly doesnt work on IE but on https://jsfiddle.net/xoy22zyc/ seems to work any thoughts robertmaxrees
[14:54:34] <robertmaxrees> no need to ask just me.
[14:54:37] <robertmaxrees> can ask the channel.
[14:54:40] <robertmaxrees> also: what version of IE?
[14:55:00] <BenMerkley> IE 10
[14:55:18] <robertmaxrees> so the fiddle works but the page doesn't?
[14:55:23] <BenMerkley> yeah
[14:56:23] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:56:37] <robertmaxrees> should be just fine.
[14:56:46] <taplar> what about other browsers?
[14:56:51] <z1haze_work> am i messing something up or does .html() not get the html of an element and all its children?
[14:56:59] <robertmaxrees> that's what it does z1haze_work
[14:57:04] <BenMerkley> other browsers appear to work
[14:57:22] <z1haze_work> so it should get the value of all children too?
[14:57:30] <LeGorille> hi guys, I have a script that breaks on explorer when a certain selector is not on the page. Any work around ??
[14:57:38] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work it gets all markup for an element, including its children, yes.
[14:57:44] <robertmaxrees> BenMerkley ff seems weird.
[14:57:50] <robertmaxrees> not really working correctly for me.
[14:58:00] <z1haze_work> ok guess im screwed up somewhere
[14:58:02] <robertmaxrees> LeGorille literally no way we can help.
[14:58:05] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the code.
[14:58:26] <LeGorille> robertmaxrees, ok few minutes
[14:59:16] <SteveDonJon> LeGorille, Example ?
[14:59:24] <robertmaxrees> already asked for that...
[14:59:24] <BenMerkley> robertmaxrees: seems to be working in FF for me weird how
[14:59:48] <robertmaxrees> BenMerkley unpredictable behavior.  clicking the different links doesn't seem to behave like a radio.
[15:00:24] <BenMerkley> odd for me it appears to work
[15:00:35] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have a caching problem maybe?
[15:01:27] <taplar> i'm not sure, but is that html that has those two pieces being blown away when either one is clicked?
[15:01:34] <LeGorille> sorry guys, this is the part of the script that's causing this issue
[15:01:34] <LeGorille> https://jsfiddle.net/v6fkuLrm/
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> Leentje so what's the problem?
[15:01:58] <taplar> i'm inspecting one of them, then clicking, and my inspection goes crazy and doesn't focus them anymore
[15:02:04] <robertmaxrees> that would do it.
[15:02:05] <WilsonG> Hi! Question , does window.load event waits untill HTML5 video is loaded or no?
[15:02:32] <robertmaxrees> WilsonG it should if you've included the video as apart of the page's markup.
[15:03:10] <taplar> yep, they're being destroyed
[15:03:16] <robertmaxrees> that would explain it.
[15:03:23] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[15:04:42] <robertmaxrees> LeGorille you're being kind of vague about your issue.  you're saying something breaks, but you're not saying WHAT breaks.
[15:04:59] <robertmaxrees> or HOW
[15:05:24] <LeGorille> robertmaxrees when that selector .flexislider is not on page, I got a console error
[15:05:48] <robertmaxrees> what's the console error you get?
[15:06:16] <LeGorille> Type Error: flexislider is undefined
[15:06:47] <BenMerkley> cleared caches and un aggregagted js dont think its caching i think its how IE is working with the checkbox
[15:07:01] <robertmaxrees> BenMerkley did you see what taplar said above?
[15:07:06] <LeGorille> that script is o=in a js file that gets included regadless whether the flexslider is on page or not
[15:07:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v6fkuLrm/2/ try something like this LeGorille
[15:07:54] <robertmaxrees> woops https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v6fkuLrm/3/
[15:12:48] <BenMerkley> no i didnt!
[15:12:50] <BenMerkley> ty
[15:13:03] <BenMerkley> taplar: anythoughts on how to fix the defocus
[15:26:45] <taplar> " robertmaxrees: use a delegated listener instead. "
[15:32:38] <z1haze_work> is there anyway to cancel a mouseleave event listener
[15:33:20] <plamb__> can you chain event handling
[15:33:29] <z1haze_work> i have an issue: when you hover over elements in my site, it will display some content above it, related to that item yourhovering on, when you mouseout it goes back to the previous content, that we temporarily saved in the mouse enter event
[15:33:39] <z1haze_work> but when you click the element, it will change permnantly
[15:33:50] <z1haze_work> my problem is that after you click it, it cahgnes, but then a user mouses out, and it changes back
[15:33:54] <plamb__> like elem.on('click', '.blah' function(){}).on('click', '.bleh'....)
[15:34:29] <z1haze_work> thats not what i am talking about
[15:44:38] <user_corrupt> what do I use to determine if a selection box has been selected or not?

[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> a "selection box"?
[15:47:56] <robertmaxrees> like a dropdown or..?

[16:05:13] <MRsxypants> because this will be where subcategories go
[16:05:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused MRsxypants
[16:05:33] <robertmaxrees> what's breaking?
[16:05:46] <MRsxypants> robertmaxrees: if you go here - http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/index.jsp and hover over one of their menu items
[16:05:52] <MRsxypants> you'll see what i'm talking about
[16:05:55] <arc_> :checked is a css thing, the property is just checked
[16:06:10] <robertmaxrees> MRsxypants yeah we do that on our site.
[16:06:14] <robertmaxrees> something similar at least.
[16:06:16] <user_corrupt> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:06:21] <robertmaxrees> but the way you're doing it is... interesting.
[16:06:29] <MRsxypants> lol
[16:06:41] <MRsxypants> can u show me a better way? i'll recode it ur way
[16:06:52] <MRsxypants> because the way i'm doing is... frustrating lol
[16:07:25] <taplar> my gut is saying the use of 'toggle' is part of the issue, :)
[16:07:29] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^
[16:07:35] <MRsxypants> ok
[16:07:40] <robertmaxrees> also, shouldn't have a mouseleave on the items themselves.
[16:07:43] <MRsxypants> should use slidedown/slideup?
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> hide open ones when you hopver a new one.
[16:08:03] <MRsxypants> hmm
[16:08:04] <robertmaxrees> and hide them when your mouse leaves the entire container.
[16:08:26] <MRsxypants> ok but what about if they move their mouse off of all the sub items and the div is just sitting htere?
[16:08:42] <robertmaxrees> that's where the mouseleave handler on the container comes in.
[16:08:55] <MRsxypants> ok
[16:09:03] <MRsxypants> let me try
[16:09:04] <MRsxypants> thanks guys
[16:18:49] <MRsxypants> it's almost working now but my delay of 2000 milliseconds isn't working https://jsfiddle.net/pme81L1w/2/
[16:19:12] <MRsxypants> sorry for my jquery noobness :?
[16:20:04] <taplar> you may need a timeout there.
[16:20:15] <taplar> dunno if at that point it can still access the queues
[16:25:32] <MRsxypants> when i do timeout it just hangs ? https://jsfiddle.net/pme81L1w/3/
[16:25:49] <plamb__> does .val() not get the value of a textarea
[16:26:42] <MRsxypants> plamb__: it does
[16:26:52] <MRsxypants> wait textarea
[16:26:57] <MRsxypants> i think so

[16:27:03] <plamb__> wtf
[16:27:14] <plamb__> is that
[16:28:07] <plamb__> <textarea type="text" name="itemntextEdit" value="Delicious Paella" style="height:60px;overflow-y:hidden;"></textarea>
[16:28:12] <plamb__> is what my element looks like
[16:28:20] <plamb__> but .val() is selecting nothing
[16:28:26] <robertmaxrees> *returning nothing
[16:28:31] <taplar> doesn't have a value
[16:28:32] <plamb__> *returning
[16:28:36] <MRsxypants> jsfiddle plamb__
[16:28:45] <taplar> <textarea>this is my value</textarea>
[16:28:51] <plamb__> so when i populate that textarea i should put it inbetween the tags?
[16:29:00] <taplar> them's how they work, yo
[16:29:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fdq6prjn/
[16:29:12] <plamb__> what does value= mean in a textarea then
[16:29:20] <taplar> nothing
[16:29:24] <plamb__> lol
[16:29:30] <taplar> dunno why your doing that
[16:29:33] <plamb__> another place an error should be
[16:29:43] <taplar> html doesn't error, :s
[16:30:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:30:03] <robertmaxrees> not a jquery concern in this case.
[16:30:22] <robertmaxrees> and you're conflating "error" with "warning" - also conflating “error” with “user knowledge”
[16:30:24] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:30:24] <robertmaxrees> brb

[16:33:14] <plamb__> did i spell something wrong
[16:33:30] <taplar> what is 'values' ?
[16:33:37] <plamb__> var values = [];
[16:33:39] <plamb__> an array
[16:33:58] <taplar> serializeArray() is used off of a form or group of Elements, iirc
[16:34:09] <plamb__> can you send an array over ajax?
[16:34:19] <MRsxypants> yes
[16:34:22] <folkrav> yup
[16:34:27] <plamb__> ah
[16:34:33] <plamb__> dont have to stringify it or anything
[16:35:26] <folkrav> does it for you

[16:52:25] <rjCousineau> hey i'm back..
[16:52:32] <robertmaxrees> lol i’m not even a trekkie
[16:52:33] <rjCousineau> did anyone take a look ? https://jsfiddle.net/dLuyp29p/
[16:53:43] <robertmaxrees> because you add the handler before the input exists.
[16:53:50] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[16:54:58] <rjCousineau> i thought .on() handled future elements
[16:55:07] <robertmaxrees> nope.  it has a syntax that will.
[16:55:10] <robertmaxrees> but it doesn’t by default.
[16:55:34] <rjCousineau> like.. live() ?
[16:55:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> like .delegate
[16:55:46] <rjCousineau> what do you mean delegate listener
[16:55:59] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:56:03] <robertmaxrees> don’t skip to the first example.
[16:56:11] <robertmaxrees> the second example in that block is what you care about.
[16:56:28] <robertmaxrees> also: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:56:51] <rjCousineau> sweet
[16:56:56] <rjCousineau> learn something new
[16:56:59] <rjCousineau> thanks robertmaxrees
[16:57:01] <rjCousineau>  $(document).delegate('.tempInput','blur',
[16:57:02] <robertmaxrees> yep./
[16:57:05] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:57:07] <robertmaxrees> use .on(*)
[16:57:10] <robertmaxrees> but actually read the docs.
[16:57:21] <rjCousineau> ohh ic
[16:57:28] <robertmaxrees> .delegate() has been deprecated.
[16:57:38] <folkrav> http://stackoverflow.com/a/8191450
[16:58:02] <rjCousineau> works $(document).on('blur', '.tempInput', function(){
[16:58:09] <folkrav> as .live, no?
[16:58:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:58:57] <robertmaxrees> folkrav you still use .on()
[16:59:40] <folkrav> i mean .live() rjCousineau mentioned
[16:59:49] <folkrav> its been deprecated for a while
[16:59:59] <robertmaxrees> lol that’s the method, sure, but you don’t use it.  the docs for .live() tell you as much :)
[17:00:50] <folkrav> oh, fair enough. misunderstood.
[17:02:06] <rjCousineau> I used to jQuery a lot, not so much.. it's still the best imho
[17:02:22] <taplar> as a verb, eh?
[17:02:28] <rjCousineau> lol
[17:02:29] <rjCousineau> yea
[17:02:48] <folkrav> rjCousineau: Cousineau... it sounds so Quebecois to me
[17:02:58] <robertmaxrees> that’s the second time you’ve said that....
[17:03:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:03:29] <folkrav> yeah, he was away the first time
[17:03:38] <taplar> when something is important
[17:03:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:04:06] <folkrav> i wouldve sent him a message but i forgot the command lol
[17:04:10] <folkrav> havent used irc in years
[17:04:33] <folkrav> :/
[17:07:47] <plamb__> if i was going to create a JSON object like this
[17:07:48] <plamb__> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11078377/3723346
[17:07:58] <plamb__> is it possible to dynamically create the attributes
[17:08:15] <plamb__> like as im looping through some html elements i can set each myObject. thingy
[17:08:24] <plamb__> instead of doing it manually
[17:08:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:09:02] <plamb__> dynamically set a property
[17:09:13] <robertmaxrees> use [] syntax.
[17:09:20] <robertmaxrees> also: don’t use new Object();
[17:09:51] <plamb__> like this
[17:09:52] <plamb__> http://pastebin.com/RVzpSx4M
[17:10:47] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don’t see the value in doing that.
[17:11:02] <plamb__> maybe this is what im looking for
[17:11:03] <plamb__> http://stackoverflow.com/a/15009561/3723346
[17:11:23] <robertmaxrees> do you wnat to make a array of entires?
[17:11:26] <robertmaxrees> or have a plain object?
[17:11:42] <plamb__> a plain object i guess
[17:12:04] <robertmaxrees> can you show me what you want the resuling json to look like?
[17:12:07] <robertmaxrees> i’m really confused
[17:12:32] <plamb__> one sec
[17:14:44] <plamb__> shit you cant link from jsonviewer.stack.hu eh
[17:14:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:14:55] <robertmaxrees> you can’t?
[17:15:12] <robertmaxrees> why not just make a fiddle then?
[17:15:17] <plamb__> http://pastebin.com/nVtpAK3u
[17:15:35] <plamb__> lets say those json props are identical to the "name" attribute of their input element
[17:15:55] <plamb__> can i grab the name attribute and generate a json structure as i loop through
[17:15:59] <plamb__> instead of doing it manually
[17:16:09] <robertmaxrees> sure - you can dynamically create names using []
[17:16:28] <robertmaxrees> var theName = this.name; theObject[theName] = this.value;
[17:17:47] <plamb__> like this?
[17:17:48] <plamb__> http://pastebin.com/cWjkA8cs
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:18:02] <robertmaxrees> var values = {};
[17:18:07] <plamb__> oh
[17:18:15] <robertmaxrees> what you had before was an array.
[17:19:06] <plamb__> aite think it worked
[17:19:08] <plamb__> thank you
[17:21:30] <MRsxypants> ok, i've almost got it working - https://jsfiddle.net/106p6xvh/1/
[17:21:41] <MRsxypants> how can i make it pause for like 1-2 seconds before the slideup animation?
[17:21:47] <MRsxypants> when i do settimeout it just freezes indefinitely
[17:22:29] <robertmaxrees> how are you using settimeout?
[17:23:19] <plamb__> robertmaxrees: should a console.log of the resulting object have quotes around the json properties like this?
[17:23:22] <plamb__> http://pastebin.com/EfK37S9u
[17:23:30] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ that’s fine.
[17:23:35] <robertmaxrees> that’s valid json.
[17:23:40] <plamb__> i see
[17:23:41] <robertmaxrees> it’ll work in practice.
[17:23:41] <MRsxypants> robertmaxrees: am doing settimeout(allmyanimationcode here, 1000)
[17:23:53] <robertmaxrees> MRsxypants show me in the fiddle pls/.
[17:23:57] <MRsxypants> ok h/o
[17:24:05] <plamb__> when i stringify it, send it to play, and convert it back to JSON it produces a ton of escapes characters
[17:24:08] <plamb__> but o well
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:24:18] <robertmaxrees> how are you stringifying it?
[17:24:27] <plamb__> JSON.stringify(values)
[17:24:34] <robertmaxrees> and how are you converting it back?
[17:24:43] <robertmaxrees> because you shouldn’t be getting any escape chars.
[17:24:53] <plamb__> well its not jquery thats converting it back but it looks like this
[17:24:54] <MRsxypants> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/106p6xvh/2/
[17:24:55] <plamb__> http://pastebin.com/qRwMd7t3
[17:25:13] <robertmaxrees> MRsxypants that’s... not how you use settimeout
[17:25:21] <MRsxypants> :/
[17:25:22] <plamb__> hmm maybe im using the wrong method...
[17:25:44] <plamb__> ah, yeah i think i was
[17:25:45] <plamb__> my b
[17:25:50] <robertmaxrees> MRsxypants https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/106p6xvh/3/

[17:26:28] <MRsxypants> robertmaxrees: <3333
[17:26:38] <robertmaxrees> glad it’s working no.
[17:26:39] <robertmaxrees> *now
[17:26:44] <snover> pics or it didn’t happen
[17:26:48] <robertmaxrees> ew
[17:26:57] <snover> :)
[17:31:19] <MRsxypants> aw but fkc
[17:31:22] <MRsxypants> fk
[17:31:24] <MRsxypants> the thing slides away
[17:31:28] <MRsxypants> even when i have my mouse over the div
[17:31:34] <MRsxypants> with the test test test test in it
[17:32:29] <MRsxypants> think i need to do cleartimeout
[17:45:40] <plamb__> {"itemidEdit": "1"} is a jsnumber no?
[17:48:29] <plamb__> for some reason {"itempriceEdit": "22"} is coming across as a jsnumber
[17:48:32] <plamb__> but the former isnt
[17:51:44] <PlanC> I'm currently using a jQuery solution to download SVGs with AJAX and display them inline on the page
[17:52:06] <PlanC> for those familiar with SVGs they have to be inline in order to modify the elements (like the colors which I'm changing)
[17:52:53] <PlanC> now the issue is that the browser isn't caching the SVGs since they're being downloaded with ajax
[17:53:40] <PlanC> so my alternative is to either inline the SVG right away, but this would add like 40 kb to the size of the HTML file
[17:54:14] <PlanC> or create two different SVGs each one with the colors that I want
[17:54:35] <PlanC> does anyone have any advice or better alternatives?
[18:00:07] <MRsxypants> robertmaxrees: do you have any ideas? to keep it from disappearing when the mouse is over .nav-items ?
[18:05:18] <MRsxypants> hmm
[18:08:52] <MRsxypants> got it
[18:11:51] <MRsxypants> https://jsfiddle.net/106p6xvh/4/
[18:16:44] <PlanC> MRsxypants, did you solve it?
[18:17:00] <PlanC> MRsxypants, you also seem to have an extra </div> (as jsfiddle is pointing out) on line 30
[18:19:36] <MRsxypants> PlanC: yea i only copied a portion of my code from my actual src that's why. Yea, I kinda figured it out but i need to fix it, it's a lil bit buggy
[19:16:45] <user_corrupt> I'm doing     $(".button.objective").on("click", function(evt){}    and I also have a listener detecting when a checkbox is clicked.. what can I do to disable the listener for .button.objective when this checkbox event is fired?
[19:50:40] <verax5> any idea why this ajax request woudnt work?
[19:50:41] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/rd46VjG2
[19:51:08] <folkrav> lemme check
[19:53:34] <verax5> returns failed
[19:53:58] <folkrav> whats the data you feed to it
[19:54:24] <verax5> its an array
[19:54:30] <verax5> [34, 43, 1, 1]
[19:54:57] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/5xg5A5QJ
[19:56:30] <folkrav> hmm
[19:58:42] <folkrav> doesnt alert take a string?
[19:58:58] <folkrav> kind of unrelated...
[20:00:59] <folkrav> but uhm
[20:01:11] <folkrav> you always return false in that code
[20:01:25] <folkrav> and always log failed
[20:02:01] <user_corrupt> I have a checkbox triggering     $('.button.objective').unbind("click");     to make a "button" unclickable, but when the checkbox is rechecked and I do      $('.button.objective').bind("click");        then the "button" remains unclickable... how do I make the button clickable again?
[20:02:03] <verax5> hm
[20:02:13] <verax5> wouldnt log failed run if it failed?
[20:02:20] <verax5> as its below the success?
[20:02:24] <verax5> lemme try changing
[20:04:01] <verax5> so where do i put return false
[20:04:12] <verax5> if i dont do that it will jump to next page
[20:06:16] <folkrav> youd need a error too
[20:06:30] <folkrav> cause that console.log('failed') is just called no matter what
[20:06:44] <folkrav> and the return false
[20:29:04] <verax5> ive a question guys
[20:29:14] <verax5> im sending an array without name
[20:29:26] <verax5> its like this: [value, value, valye]
[20:29:41] <folkrav> yeah?
[20:29:45] <verax5> but im unable to catch that on server since its array without name
[20:30:06] <folkrav> hmm... what do you mean?
[20:30:09] <verax5> how can i give it a name when posting it using ajax
[20:30:10] <verax5> one sec
[20:30:20] <folkrav> you're trying to access it server side how?
[20:30:51] <verax5> im posting this data to server
[20:30:51] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/EbGv9CTB
[20:31:13] <verax5> typically in laravel i'd do $request->input('arrayname');
[20:31:59] <folkrav> well now server side you get an array thats jsoned at the key "data"
[20:33:38] <verax5> fokray
[20:33:49] <verax5> ajax automatically ads content type json?
[20:34:19] <systemfault> Why would it?
[20:34:48] <systemfault> dataType: 'json' asks the server to give you back json
[20:35:17] <verax5> so i can access data onn my server using 'data' variable right folkrav?
[20:36:56] <folkrav> what youre sending to your server
[20:37:01] <folkrav> is a POST request
[20:37:25] <folkrav> in your POST request, youll have a key that's "data"
[20:37:38] <folkrav> $_POST["data"] I believe
[20:39:14] <folkrav> i dont know the specifics of laravel but the data is in the POST request
[20:40:49] <folkrav> verax5: scrap that, im dumb
[20:41:06] <folkrav> you have to push a key:value pair in that data
[20:41:32] <verax5> yee i was wondering that
[20:41:42] <verax5> im using map to get the valuyes
[20:41:50] <verax5> but i dont know how to put them into an array
[20:41:58] <verax5> like[key=>value]
[20:42:03] <folkrav> http://pastebin.com/HWJ1915r
[20:42:36] <folkrav> youll then access it through $_POST["arrayName"]
[20:43:48] <verax5> oh worrked man
[20:43:50] <verax5> :)
[20:44:06] <folkrav> yeah, that data part HAS to be key:value pairs
[20:44:09] <verax5> i thought u could pass just array as said in docs
[20:44:11] <verax5> ohh yee
[20:44:29] <folkrav> well yeah, you can just pass an array as its turned to a string
[20:44:41] <folkrav> but you need a key to access it in the request
[20:46:17] <verax5> yee i see man
[20:46:20] <verax5> thanks alot
[20:46:32] <folkrav> np
[21:10:47] <ISmithers> Is there a way to find a selector and then execute a function on it? For example $('.class').find('ul > li > a', function(){if($(this).next().length) { // do something });
[21:12:30] <folkrav> depends... what do you mean execute a function? what are you trying to do exactly?
[21:14:34] <ISmithers> folkrav: I have this markup https://db.tt/N0rKX1TU and wish to add a down chevron icon to all <a> elements if they are followed by a <ul>. It indicates there is a sub-menu. So I already have code that is operating on the menu, and I have a big chain going, so thought to add this logic in to the part of the chain where I am doing things with the <a> already. However it would require a function to check if there is a .next() element (the
[21:14:34] <ISmithers> <ul>).
[21:15:16] <ISmithers> (Naturally I don't _need_ to do this in the current chain, I just thought I could try and see if it was possible)
[21:17:21] <ISmithers> I have this at present which works .each(function () { if($(this).next().length) { $(this).find('.icon').addClass('fa fa-chevron-down'); } });
[21:17:25] <folkrav> well find returns a jquery object
[21:17:29] <ISmithers> I guess that's the way :)
[21:18:02] <folkrav> and you can call .get() to get an array of elements you can then manipulate i guess
[21:18:12] <folkrav> havent had to do this though so I guess if your thing works :P
[21:19:03] <folkrav> but yeah, the each way seems more concise
[21:19:24] <ISmithers> Yeah, that's the final chain code http://hastebin.com/ehayevoyap.js just for interest's sake.
[21:19:48] <folkrav> yeah that's definitely cleaner than my thing
