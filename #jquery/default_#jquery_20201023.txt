[21:04:59] <robertparkerx> $( likebtn ).data( 'action', 'simple-unlike' ); -- for some reason this isn't changing the current value
[21:05:10] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/3u
[21:05:17] <robertmaxrees> going to guess you're looking in the inspector pane to check?
[21:05:22] <robertparkerx> yes
[21:05:39] <robertparkerx> it doesn't allow me to unlike
[21:05:45] <robertparkerx> I have to refresh
[21:05:49] <robertmaxrees> that's why.  the attribute value doesn't change, but if you console.log($(likebtn).data('action')); it'll work.
[21:06:06] <robertparkerx> darn
[21:06:11] <robertparkerx> I hoped it was wrong
[21:06:54] <robertparkerx> can I request $(this).data('action); after ?
[21:06:55] <robertmaxrees> what part "doesn't work"?
[21:07:00] <robertparkerx> will it also return the same
[21:07:16] <robertmaxrees> the same as what??
[21:07:27] <robertparkerx> It will like the post but it will not let me unlike it. It will return 400 error.
[21:07:39] <robertparkerx> the same as console.log($(likebtn).data('action'));
[21:08:04] <robertmaxrees> console.log() just logs out whatever the value is.
[21:08:19] <robertmaxrees> so $(likebtn).data('action') is what you want.
[21:08:51] <robertparkerx> yea it changes
[21:09:34] <robertmaxrees> so then you need to troubleshoot why you're getting that 400.
[21:09:37] <robertparkerx> it works if I console log?
[21:09:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:09:55] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/3v
[21:09:59] <robertparkerx> I can like and unlike now
[21:10:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you had a caching issue then.
[21:10:50] <robertmaxrees> remove that console log and try again.
[21:12:52] <robertparkerx> odd
[21:12:54] <robertparkerx> it works
[21:13:02] <robertmaxrees> now that you removed the console log?
[21:13:07] <robertparkerx> yes
[21:13:13] <robertmaxrees> likely a caching issue then.
[21:16:30] <robertparkerx> ty robertmaxrees
[21:17:02] <robertmaxrees> sure
