[07:01:04] <Robdgreat> channels are hard
[08:17:32] <parias> it seems removeData() disabkes datepicker....anyone seen this unexpected behavior?
[08:26:53] <Cork> parias: you mean without any arguments?
[08:27:04] <Cork> then ya, it will wipe the datepicker config
[08:31:58] <parias> Cork:yes without arguments
[08:32:11] <Cork> then yes that is expected
[08:32:29] <Cork> if you wipe the datepickers config from the element it will stop working
[08:33:51] <parias> well..I just wanted to clean/remove the data store from an element which had dpicked attached to it and unfortunately it removed dpicker...
[08:34:31] <parias> is the only solution not to use data() on that element?
[08:34:56] <Cork> no just remove the data you add not all data anyone added
[08:35:23] <Cork> data('added-data-by-me', 'works); removeData('added-data-by-me')
[08:36:13] <Robdgreat> I'm confused how it can be classed unexpected behavior
[08:36:25] <Cork> it can't
[08:36:29] <Robdgreat> ah ok
[08:36:41] <Cork> it is extreamly expected behaviour
[08:37:20] <undefined_bob> are you alright, cork?
[08:37:53] <Cork> ya
[08:38:14] <undefined_bob> glad to hear that
[09:23:16] <parias> do you consider jquery vanillaJS?
[09:28:55] <Cork> yes, jquery is a helper, not a language
[09:29:05] <Cork> it doesn't extend the language in anyway
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> some weird questions overnight.
[16:49:38] <xibalba> hey , i've got this snippet of code i'm working on. https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/MypsdDTg5W/ , it's working successfully, but i wanted to know what i might look to use to update the <p id="ajaxP"> section to say something else like 'working' when the submit button is clicked, then do the API call and return the response.
[16:49:56] <xibalba> my API call can take a couple of seconds so i need to let the user know i'm doing somerthing
[16:50:24] <robertmaxrees> xibalba just select the p and use .text() before the ajax call fires.
[16:51:03] <xibalba> would i do that between lines 3 and 4, or lines 4 and 5. i think 4-5 is the right place
[16:51:04] <robertmaxrees> you're doing something very similar in your success callback already :)
[16:51:31] <robertmaxrees> between 4 and 5 - you need it to be the first thing in your submit handler.
[16:52:32] <xibalba> ok thanks. networking engineer trying to write some ajax/python code :)
[16:52:42] <xibalba> so i can spit back some traceroutes!
[16:55:00] <robertmaxrees> neat
[16:55:54] <robertmaxrees> i'
[16:56:03] <robertmaxrees> *i'd default to .text() over .html() when possible btw.
[16:56:08] <xibalba> is this kind of the right direction with line 4
[16:56:08] <xibalba> https://jsfiddle.net/wxq2jmh4/1/
[16:56:32] <robertmaxrees> sort of?  you use .text() the same way you do .html().
[16:56:56] <xibalba> oh dur, i should have saw that.
[16:57:00] <robertmaxrees> .text() is a function - you can't set a value like that.  you need to pass your data instead.
[16:57:40] <xibalba> thanks. i should know better than that, total brain fart on that one.
[16:57:49] <robertmaxrees> so you'll never see foo() = 'some value'; since in JS that's not a thing :)
[16:57:54] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[16:58:16] <xibalba> hey! it works
[16:59:02] <xibalba> ah blast another CORS issue
[16:59:15] <robertmaxrees> cross-domain??
[16:59:32] <xibalba> yeh thought i had this fixed yesterday. that's an issue w/the Bottle Python framework i'm trying
[16:59:47] <xibalba> i think anyways, not a web dev haha
[17:00:38] <robertmaxrees> why are you going cross-origin?
[17:01:32] <xibalba> i didn't think i was. to be honest i'm not super familiar with the cross origin issues. i refreshed the page and it's working now. i'll privately message you the URL if you want to see it
[17:01:46] <robertmaxrees> needs to be on the same port, protocol, and url.
[17:01:49] <robertmaxrees> nah - no need :)
[17:02:05] <xibalba> ah, it's a different port. i'm launbching just a dev python3 webserver on 8080
[17:02:20] <xibalba> maybe if i use nginx to reverse proxy it to some python thing internally it should be fine
[17:02:41] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[17:03:22] <xibalba> thanks alot i appreciate the help
