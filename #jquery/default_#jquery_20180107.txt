[04:03:03] <Woet> senaps: what is your jQuery question?
[04:03:22] <Woet> wrong room again?
[04:04:28] <senaps> Woet i want to select each html element that has class `x`, and give it a specific css style! i want to give `animation-delay: randomtime`.
[04:04:50] <Woet> senaps: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[04:05:46] <senaps> i want for each element in that class, not the class itself.
[04:06:55] <senaps> or .css is called for each?
[04:07:02] <senaps> thanks.... it does match each element.

[17:34:15] <db_rando> hey brehs
[17:34:19] <db_rando> why isn't this working
[17:34:26] <db_rando> https://thepasteb.in/p/O7h5x8QJLwliq
[17:34:34] <db_rando> I think it's how I've separated each line but
[17:34:36] <db_rando> I can't tell
[17:35:02] <db_rando> It will work flawlessly if there's just one instance of a class being added
[17:35:06] <db_rando> but with multiple it does nothing
[17:35:44] <Audlex> does data-filter definitely start with a .?
[17:35:55] <db_rando> yes
[17:36:20] <db_rando> when i delete any 2 lines
[17:36:24] <db_rando> the third one will work without hitch
[17:39:13] <Audlex> classes shouldn't start with .
[17:39:18] <Audlex> but seems to work find on my end
[17:44:00] <db_rando> Worked it out
[17:44:03] <db_rando> Thanks audlex
