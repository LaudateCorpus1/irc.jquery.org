[09:20:08] <jomofcw> As there is no IRC Channel about Zurb Foundation (I hate slack :D) I try to ask here : the event "down.zf.accordionMenu" seems to never fired from a fonctionnal AccordionMenu... I can't get why (using "$myElement.on('down.zf.accordionMenu',function(){/* ... */});", also tried to get it from $(window), not better). Any idea why, please ?
[10:39:53] <cpama> hi all.  i'm having some problems troubleshooting a web app that uses jquery datatables
[10:40:00] <cpama> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/1gGu0u57nP8hcebkHxeo/
[10:40:16] <cpama> that's the script that includes the datatables logic.
[10:40:41] <cpama> as you can see it's doing an ajax call to cgi-bin/mvspaging_list to grab the json data
[10:41:21] <cpama> the call fails and when I check the request / response in F12 Network page, I see the response is returning all the actual code in mvspaging_list vs. json data
[10:41:42] <cpama> not sure what needs doing... or where to start troubleshooting
[10:44:51] <cpama> when I check the logs on the webserver, this is what i see:
[10:45:21] <cpama> https://paste.pound-python.org/show/kI0QWoMlTlEFNP8vcEf3/
[10:45:37] <cpama> line 5 shows you the request for the mvspaging_list
[10:45:46] <cpama> which should return a json object
[11:14:58] <RM982> I run $('.myloader').fadeOut(1000); when DOMContentLoaded is triggered  and it doesn't show the animation, it is working just as hide()
[11:15:10] <RM982> what could be causing that issue?
[11:16:52] <shoky_> cpama: if the server is not responding with the correct data then it's a server-side issue, not jquery related
[12:55:46] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[13:18:05] <m00sehead> I want to copy an element, remove some of its children by class, and then put it somewhere else. I've tried var el = $('.myElement').clone().remove('.myElementChild') and then $('#container').append( el )
[13:18:07] <m00sehead> but it's not working
[13:18:42] <robertmaxrees> m00sehead you want .find('.myElementChild').remove()
[13:18:53] <m00sehead> oh ok thanks
[13:19:04] <robertmaxrees> .remove('.myElementChild') will just remove whatever .myElement that has that class.
[13:19:14] <m00sehead> I see how it works now
[13:20:47] <m00sehead> robertmaxrees: i need it to also remove that elements children too
[13:21:29] <m00sehead> sec
[13:23:39] <m00sehead> is there something in the jquery docs that says if a method actual modifies the object or if it just returns the new value
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/09s15ro7/ m00sehead
[13:28:37] <robertmaxrees> ah i see where you're getting confused.
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> you need to do the .clone() and then do the find/remove separately.
[14:13:18] <pilotbob> hi all.
[14:14:41] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[14:14:48] <pilotbob> Not sure why I can't get this. I have this $("input[data-validate]:visible:enabled") and I want to exclude any inputs that are in the last row of a table.  filter(function(e) { $(this).parents('tr:visible:last','.amsi-editgrid').length > 0 }) Doesn't seem right.
[14:15:32] <robertmaxrees> 'tr:visible:last','.amsi-editgrid'
[14:15:40] <robertmaxrees> parents only takes one arg, but you're passing two
[14:16:45] <pilotbob> so, something like this? filter(function(e) { $(this).parents('.amsi-editgrid tr:visible:last').length == 0 })
[14:16:55] <robertmaxrees> though i gotta ask - any reason you're not using tfoot for that last row?
[14:17:37] <robertmaxrees> would make selecting a bit easier i reckon
[14:17:42] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i gotta go - sorry :)
[14:18:05] <pilotbob> there is no footer in the table.
[14:31:46] <pilotbob> so any suggestion on getting all :inputs except those in the last row of the table?
[16:06:39] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[18:19:19] <GeekMonkey> How can I remove single and double quotes from a string and at the same time remove all words that start with #
[18:22:21] <Gh0st_Preacher> regex
[18:25:29] <GeekMonkey> any sugestion for that robertmaxrees
[18:25:41] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[18:27:46] <cannap> he wants the solution
[18:37:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:10:26] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[19:14:15] <zrtech[m]> I have a script I wrote that I need to convert into a function to make it reusable and have no clue how to do that...is there anyone that can help me with this?
[19:14:40] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] suire.
[19:14:42] <robertmaxrees> *sure
[19:14:53] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] show us the code?
[19:15:16] <robertmaxrees> preferably via jsfiddle
[19:16:05] <Neo4> zrtech[m]: function name(){
[19:16:05] <Neo4> ...
[19:16:05] <Neo4> put here code
[19:16:05] <Neo4> ...
[19:16:05] <Neo4> }
[19:16:23] <robertmaxrees> -_-
[19:16:51] <Neo4> zrtech[m]: then include <script src="name.js">
[19:16:51] <Neo4> and call
[19:16:51] <Neo4> name()
[19:17:18] <zrtech[m]> O_o making a fiddle
[19:20:52] <robertmaxrees> Neo4 he was asking for help, not for the answer ;)
[19:21:38] <Neo4> robertmaxrees: I am bored, just wrote something... )
[19:21:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:22:15] <Neo4> robertmaxrees: long time didn't do javascript, I'm doing shell script now
[19:22:21] <Neo4> app that will install VPS
[19:22:22] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[19:22:41] <Neo4> robertmaxrees: ?
[19:22:44] <Neo4> ok :)
[19:22:48] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#giving-good-answers
[19:22:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:24:39] <Neo4> robertmaxrees: do you know shell?
[19:24:45] <Neo4> very cool langauge
[19:24:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:26:18] <robertmaxrees> which shell are you working with?
[19:26:28] <Neo4> robertmaxrees: !#/bin/bash
[19:26:45] <robertmaxrees> so bash
[19:26:52] <Neo4> I don't know, I'm doing script that will install LAMP and mail server
[19:27:08] <robertmaxrees> "shell" isn't a language fwiw.
[19:28:01] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] any luck?
[19:28:07] <Neo4> robertmaxrees: see how it looks https://ibb.co/f0msFd
[19:28:18] <robertmaxrees> sure is a bash script
[19:28:26] <Neo4> robertmaxrees: it's better than C in books is written
[19:28:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:28:40] <robertmaxrees> it's not really comparable to c.
[19:28:46] <robertmaxrees> different purpose entirely.
[19:29:05] <Neo4> robertmaxrees: downsides it's slow, but more pawerful than c
[19:29:18] <zrtech[m]> robertmaxrees: I am having a hard time building a fiddle with my script because it is a complicated one, but i'm trying
[19:29:19] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:29:19] <Neo4> it has more possibilities
[19:29:33] <robertmaxrees> Neo4 not necessarily true
[19:29:36] <robertmaxrees> it's a scripting language.
[19:29:44] <robertmaxrees> completely different goals
[19:29:48] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] erm, is all the code in it?
[19:29:56] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if it doesn't work.
[19:35:18] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] any reason you didn't link that in the channel?
[19:35:50] <zrtech[m]> yeah i don't want to share my work with the world shrugs
[19:35:53] <robertmaxrees> also: you've already got some code in a function - so where's the confusion?
[19:35:59] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[19:36:13] <robertmaxrees> that kind of undermines the purpose of the channel, y'know?
[19:36:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:36:21] <robertmaxrees> the idea is multiple people can provide insight and stuff :D
[19:36:34] <zrtech[m]> i'm willing to help but not hand out every drop of my work
[19:36:36] <GeekMonkey> can someone help with a regex expression to remove any word that starts with #
[19:36:57] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] no offense, but nothing in here is necessarily a big secret :)
[19:37:07] <robertmaxrees> nobody's going to steal your work, I promise.
[19:37:08] <zrtech[m]> and i need the code I wrote to be able to accept multiple elements robertmaxrees
[19:37:39] <robertmaxrees> okay - so really your question is "how do i make this work with multiple  $('.field--name-field-slider-text') ?
[19:38:17] <GeekMonkey> zrtech[m] what slider are you using?
[19:38:49] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey what have you tried so far?
[19:39:47] <GeekMonkey> caption.replace(/\"/g, "").replace(/\#*/g, "");
[19:40:05] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey so what's the issue then? :)
[19:40:14] <robertmaxrees> help us help you.
[19:40:28] <Guest64481> Hi, How can I get next line distinct from database to set it to different div
[19:40:34] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] also: how many elements are we talking here?
[19:40:38] <Guest64481> using php and jquery
[19:40:42] <zrtech[m]> so if I had multiple elements on my page with the class .fadeIn, how do I get my script to iterate through each .fadeIn. I tried using the .each() function to check for each .fadeIn, but that ended up running all elements found in one scroll, whereas I need it to run for each element - this is too complicated to explain damn it robertmaxrees
[19:40:46] <robertmaxrees> Guest57535 you mean via ajax or...?
[19:41:03] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees.... it removes the # but not the letters after it
[19:41:03] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] .each() is how you'd do that.
[19:41:08] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees are you talking to me ?
[19:41:21] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 woops yeah
[19:41:36] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] can you show me what you had with the .each() ?
[19:41:49] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees  I'm using load function wit h jquery
[19:41:58] <robertmaxrees> you basically have multiple elements you want to fade in on scroll
[19:42:05] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 yeah, so ajax :)
[19:42:19] <zrtech[m]> robertmaxrees: .each() doesn't work, it runs the script all at once for multiple elements which breaks its purpose
[19:42:32] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] can you show me what you tried with .each() ?
[19:42:39] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] because that's what you'd need to use here.
[19:42:54] <zrtech[m]> i'll update the fiddle
[19:43:12] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 so first step, you need to setup your php to fetch that line.
[19:43:30] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees  look what Ive done
[19:43:43] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 i don't know php soooo
[19:43:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:43:48] <robertmaxrees> that part is up to you.
[19:46:45] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees look jquery maybe its not that clear,  or anyone else for php part one right side ? https://jsfiddle.net/ucrpcxm5/1/
[19:47:50] <Guest64481> I'm making a categories product. I have 4 div with class name = item , in a row , I want for every item to get a new line from database
[19:48:17] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 is your question about the JS or about your PHP?
[19:48:46] <Neo4> GeekMonkey: try this /\b#.\S+\b/
[19:48:58] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees both I don't know where should I look first, I know php is not good
[19:49:10] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 get your php working first.
[19:49:18] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 and then get the js working
[19:49:31] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees I can get values from database if it's your suggestion
[19:49:42] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 so your php is working?
[19:50:12] <GeekMonkey> Neo4 ... that doesn't work?
[19:50:18] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees I can get lines from my database yes but I don't know how to manipulate my php code so that I can have a new line from database for each item
[19:50:20] <Neo4> GeekMonkey: .replace(/\b\#\S+\b/g, "");
[19:50:26] <Neo4> GeekMonkey: really?
[19:50:42] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey make a fiddle, yo :)
[19:50:57] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 so what is the php actually returning?
[19:52:05] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees one line from databse with this condition if($row = $result->fetch())
[19:52:19] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 show me the actual returned data in the fiddle, yo.
[19:54:31] <GeekMonkey> https://jsfiddle.net/8kucwz6b/
[19:54:37] <GeekMonkey> line 25
[19:54:57] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:55:05] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees I can't generate the actual generated data with my code on jsfiddle.
[19:55:11] <robertmaxrees> }, options.speed); ?
[19:55:28] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 which is why you grab it from your actual server and then paste it in.
[19:55:32] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees I can make a screenshot
[19:55:36] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey i though tyou were asking about a regex?
[19:55:45] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 then you can copy/paste the data :)
[19:57:52] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey going back to your original question - you want to remove double and single quotes, as well as all words that start with a # ?
[19:57:58] <robertmaxrees> so given https://jsfiddle.net/034qr3Lv/
[19:58:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:58:18] <GeekMonkey> yes
[19:58:28] <robertmaxrees> so now apply your regex to that :)
[19:59:37] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees I'll give you a link to the screnshot it's better
[19:59:45] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 it's not though.
[19:59:55] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 i can actually help show you what you need to do.
[20:00:07] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're asking me to hand-transcribe for you.
[20:00:13] <robertmaxrees> which is a big no lol
[20:02:46] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees  I have 12 items,  4 columns and 3 lines. each columns it's a div with class name item. I'm trying to get one line from database per item.  But I have  One line from database for all items
[20:02:59] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees Am I clear ? sorry for english
[20:03:09] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 good luck!
[20:03:46] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees what ??
[20:04:09] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 i keep asking for an example of the data but you keep not giving it to me.  a screenshot won't help.  a description won't either.
[20:04:15] <robertmaxrees> an actual example would (shrug)
[20:04:33] <zrtech[m]> robertmaxrees: family member got in auto wreck, need to tend to that - thank you for trying to help me so far
[20:04:49] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] oh no!  good luck :(
[20:05:08] <Guest64481> look on css side https://jsfiddle.net/ucrpcxm5/2/
[20:05:43] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 i thought you were returning 1 row at a time??
[20:06:38] <Neo4> GeekMonkey: https://jsfiddle.net/xm0yjp5f/1/
[20:06:54] <robertmaxrees> Neo4 erm.
[20:07:25] <Neo4> \b#\S+\b doesn't match word because word can't start from #
[20:07:51] <Neo4> normally \bword\b or \<word\>
[20:08:18] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees I'm returning 12 times the same line I want 12 distinct line from database for each item
[20:09:07] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 okay.  so you get this text blob back from your DB.  any reason you're not returning JSON or some other structured format?
[20:09:14] <robertmaxrees> that'd make it easier to work with :)
[20:09:25] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees When My js function iterate on the fist item I want the php to get the next line from database for the next item
[20:09:42] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 you mean the next 12 items?
[20:09:44] <robertmaxrees> or...?
[20:10:03] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees Don't know how to use JSON I tought it's possible with only jquery and php mysql
[20:10:21] <Guest64481> yes
[20:10:35] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 almost every language has some kind of built-in JSON formatter.
[20:10:47] <robertmaxrees> it gets it into a format the JS can better understand.
[20:10:47] <Guest64481> item 1 = line 1 database , item 2 = line 2 etc...
[20:11:01] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 you keep flipping back and forth.
[20:11:25] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 is 1 line in the db equal to https://i.imgur.com/XMVjGxU.png ?
[20:11:53] <robertmaxrees> or https://i.imgur.com/d7GCQU9.png
[20:12:56] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees yes second.
[20:13:13] <Guest64481> And for the next item I want the next line from database
[20:13:51] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 okay.  so is the PHP doing its part for that?
[20:13:55] <robertmaxrees> grabbing each line?
[20:14:06] <Ninjacoder> hi, why this request is not responding , https://jsfiddle.net/_ninjacoder_/j7trng84/ ?
[20:14:33] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder it is?
[20:14:41] <Ninjacoder> where?
[20:14:44] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder look at your console
[20:15:10] <Ninjacoder> in jquery the document.write is something like $(result).html("text") ?
[20:15:10] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder you mean why is it printing [object Object] ?
[20:15:16] <Ninjacoder> yes
[20:15:31] <robertmaxrees> because you can't just coerce an object to a string like that.
[20:15:35] <Ninjacoder> and why not the objetcs line by line
[20:15:35] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees with this loop yes while($row = $result->fetch()) , but her one item gets all the lines from the table
[20:15:45] <Ninjacoder> normal.
[20:15:49] <robertmaxrees> you can do document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data)
[20:16:06] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 so your PHP isn't doing what it needs to do.
[20:16:21] <Ninjacoder> hm,go to code
[20:16:21] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees yes
[20:16:26] <robertmaxrees> i gotta get going, but Guest64481 you need to figure out how to get one line at a time.
[20:16:30] <robertmaxrees> head to ##php for that.
[20:16:35] <robertmaxrees> ignore the JS fgor a bigf.
[20:16:38] <robertmaxrees> *for a bit
[20:16:49] <Guest64481> robertmaxrees I think your right
[20:16:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:17:07] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder are you expecting it to just print out all formatted?
[20:17:26] <Guest64481> because my js function works for every item
[20:18:01] <robertmaxrees> Guest64481 yes and no.  you need to make your php work first.
[20:18:03] <Ninjacoder> robertmaxrees print now for a moment
[20:18:33] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder huh?
[20:18:38] <robertmaxrees> either way, i gotta go.
[20:18:40] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeeeeee
[20:18:46] <Ninjacoder> brb
[20:35:06] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/034qr3Lv/
[21:41:45] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees regex is not correct
