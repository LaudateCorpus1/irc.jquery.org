[01:54:59] <lonequid> Ah, beautiful. Thanks!
[02:30:21] <sincorchetes> Good morning, I want to know, How I can change te value of data-loc-subject http://jsfiddle.net/1chxpypm/. I tried each function, but I still getting the same result.
[02:32:28] <Cork> sincorchetes: http://jsfiddle.net/1chxpypm/1/
[02:32:50] <Cork> data doesn't modify the properties on the element, it modifies jqueries cache
[02:33:19] <Cork> this is so it can hold anything other then strings (as dom properties is limited to strings)
[02:34:45] <sincorchetes> But, I don't want modify property. I only want to show the new value of data-loc-subject
[02:34:56] <Cork> sincorchetes: then use .data('loc-subject')
[02:35:18] <Cork> .attr gets the attribute value from the dom element, and .data doesn't touch that (by design)
[02:36:03] <Cork> if it did, something like $(elm1).data('rel', elm2) wouldn't work
[02:36:41] <sincorchetes> Yes I used it as jsfiddle, but If you test it. You'll know that alert show the same value at differents links
[02:37:12] <Cork> yes it did, cause you used .attr
[02:38:03] <sincorchetes> I've removed it, but still persist
[02:38:05] <Cork> also, $('.als-item').data() will always get the data from the first element matching the element
[02:38:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/1chxpypm/2/
[02:39:46] <sincorchetes> mmm, thanks

[03:52:46] <ki> hi
[05:32:13] <DukeDrake> hi
[05:34:16] <DukeDrake> I'm a little stuck ...
[05:36:58] <DukeDrake> I have a event listener for a click on li-elements of a nested list. (1) Howver it doesn't apply to the li I click on, but to the outer most. Why? (2) if I stop event propagation, it works but then the other event listener on an anchor element in the list item won't fire ...
[05:37:47] <Cork> DukeDrake: try creating a jsfiddle showing the problem
[05:38:22] <DukeDrake> ok ...
[05:57:20] <DukeDrake> btw: is it possible to clear the console.log()?
[05:58:42] <DukeDrake> it works in the fiddle ....... of course -.-

[06:42:29] <V7> Hey all :)
[06:42:55] <V7> Is it possible to select all rows in all tables (datatables) and how ?
[06:43:00] <V7> Only via cycle ?
[06:43:37] <Cork> DreamStiffler: https://jsfiddle.net/0p2n4q71/2/
[06:45:03] <Cork> V7: if you need how to do it in datatable you should prob ask in there forums instead
[06:45:04] <V7> Oh $( ".dataTable" ).DataTable( ).tables( ).rows( ).select( );
[06:45:23] <V7> Thank you Cork ;)
[06:45:52] <DreamStiffler> tq Cork master. i will try and digest this
[06:48:27] <Cork> DreamStiffler: i would recommend NOT basing it on the content of the element if you can
[06:48:47] <DreamStiffler> Cork: what do you suggest then?
[06:48:59] <Cork> not sure what it is you're trying to do
[06:49:17] <DreamStiffler> Cork: maybe somewhere along the lines here : https://jsfiddle.net/0p2n4q71/3/
[06:50:01] <DreamStiffler> thats without the earlier variable
[06:50:04] <Cork> but 1. use the ya, that does about the same thing except it hides the unstable and expensive code behind :contains()
[06:50:10] <Cork> opps
[06:50:18] <Cork> - "but 1. use the "
[06:50:53] <Cork> the reason you should avoid selecting based on element content, is 1. css can't do it at all, so you have to loop in js to find it
[06:50:54] <DreamStiffler> err expensive?
[06:51:10] <Cork> 2. translation, spaces and things like that will break it
[06:51:36] <DreamStiffler> what if i do a checking for space
[06:51:52] <Cork> doesn't really solve the problem
[06:52:33] <Cork> i would recommend adding an attribute with the value if you can, for example
[06:52:53] <Cork> something like <div class="WC" data-name="ABC"></div>
[06:53:05] <Cork> or event better next the related elements in a parent
[06:53:10] <Cork> (replace the br)
[06:53:34] <DreamStiffler> or event better next the related elements in a parent ?
[06:55:10] <Cork> DreamStiffler: https://jsfiddle.net/0p2n4q71/4/
[07:01:54] <dawg> hi
[07:02:28] <DreamStiffler> ok
[07:02:35] <DreamStiffler> ok thanks a lot Cork
[07:02:41] <DreamStiffler> but why is it better this way
[07:02:45] <DreamStiffler> i see its more cleaner
[07:02:53] <DreamStiffler> *its cleaner
[07:03:14] <Cork> DreamStiffler: cause you group related elements together, witch means you can make performant simple selectors to grab the data
[07:03:34] <Cork> DreamStiffler: the old layout has no structure, so you can't find anything simply
[07:04:10] <DreamStiffler> understood, sort of less processing if i might say?
[07:05:04] <DreamStiffler> thanks a bunch Cork . i will look further on to combining both . but should work with the samples you gave. thanks again master
[07:05:04] <Cork> to select an element the difference in selection cost is id/class, attribute, element content
[07:05:23] <Cork> id class are very very fast, as the browser has hash tables to map these in memory
[07:05:48] <Cork> attributes are slow, as the browser will have to walk the dom tree and search for attribute names and then its content (if you select based on it)
[07:06:20] <Cork> content is VERY slow as it has to walk each dom extract the content of the element and its child elements and convert it to text
[07:06:28] <Cork> and then string check the result
[07:06:33] <DreamStiffler> ok yeah thats what i figured
[07:06:40] <DreamStiffler> after your sample
[07:06:48] <DreamStiffler> ok ok
[07:07:00] <DreamStiffler> will try later. will be back with result if any
[07:07:04] <DreamStiffler> thanks

[09:08:09] <DukeDrake> re
[09:09:33] <DukeDrake> to illustrate my problem ... : https://jsfiddle.net/kty278r5/2/
[09:10:53] <DukeDrake> why does the buttonclick not get triggered ..... but when I attach that event not to #somecontainer, but to .lvl1, it works???
[09:12:00] <Cork> DukeDrake: cause when the click event bubbles to .lvl1 you cancel the event bubbling
[09:12:07] <Cork> so it never bubbles up to #somecontainer
[09:12:14] <Cork> and hense it can't see the click event
[09:12:25] <Cork> (you should avoid stopPropagation() completely)
[09:13:04] <Cork> instead add a filter to the specific handler you DON'T want to react to the event when a specific situation is true
[09:16:24] <DukeDrake> that's the catch: if I remove the stopPropagation(), it doesn't mark the li I click on, but the outer most ... ! :(
[09:19:58] <Cork> DukeDrake: https://jsfiddle.net/v6e80ffr/1/
[09:25:33] <DukeDrake> Cork: brilliant! =D
[09:25:48] <DukeDrake> That's exactly what I need =)
[09:39:55] <Cork> DukeDrake: actually a bit more optimized https://jsfiddle.net/v6e80ffr/2/

[13:52:49] <robertmaxrees> heh are you asking how to a toggle a class?
[13:55:28] <TWG> Well I was trying to see what the best approach would be to handle the toggling when the sticky is in effect as well as when the window.resize is triggered.
[13:55:50] <robertmaxrees> debounce/throttle the handler for resize./
[13:55:58] <robertmaxrees> and then your logic would need to go in there.

[15:41:11] <Levin^> hello
[15:42:06] <Levin^> I created this code, so it will detect if the div with class gm-style-pbc has opacity:1
[15:42:09] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/EwONgx
[15:42:22] <Levin^> it works, but when I implemented on my website, it didn't work
[15:42:55] <Levin^> http://ldb.nacaodesign.com.br/nossas-lojas/
[15:44:02] <Levin^> if you inspect it, my js file is called style.js
[15:44:36] <Levin^> it should affect the text inside the google map
[15:44:50] <Levin^> "Digite o endereço ou CEP"
[15:45:04] <Levin^> how to make it add a class in that element?
[15:57:17] <GeekMonkey> Hey all
[15:57:43] <GeekMonkey> https://codepen.io/rsmm/pen/oGQYEB?editors=0010
[15:57:53] <GeekMonkey> Can someone tell me why this scripts hates the number 29
[16:07:51] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey you mean why it stops on that number?
[16:08:04] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re - you don't use jquery to make api endpoints.
[16:08:53] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey the html looks like it sets the maximum number you want it to hit.
[16:09:05] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re and no need to PM :)
[16:09:21] <shoky> GeekMonkey: it's a rounding issue, floating point crap
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re no need to PM me :)
[16:19:08] <gambl0re> how do i do it?
[16:19:18] <robertmaxrees> how do you create api endpoints with jquery?
[16:19:33] <robertmaxrees> you don't - jquery is a dom abstraction api.
[16:25:26] <Levin^> hi, what am I doing wrong? I'm trying to change the second text color:
[16:25:27] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/EwONgx
[16:25:51] <Levin^> if you hover the first word, it should change the color of the second word
[16:26:15] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ using that if ($(opacidadeMapa).css('opacity') == '0.5') { ?
[16:26:49] <Levin^> yes
[16:26:59] <Levin^> it will add a class to the element
[16:27:08] <Levin^> and that class has a color
[16:27:09] <robertmaxrees> you need an event listener for that.
[16:27:13] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it only runs on pageload.
[16:27:21] <Levin^> how to write that?
[16:27:40] <robertmaxrees> you have one already in that code.
[16:27:52] <robertmaxrees> $(opacidadeMapa).hover(function(e) {
[16:28:29] <Levin^> can I make it detect the element changing it itself?
[16:28:45] <robertmaxrees> you can, but that's  abad idea.
[16:28:49] <robertmaxrees> just use an event listener instead.
[16:28:53] <robertmaxrees> you alreayd have one there - just add to it.
[16:29:06] <Levin^> it's because the real code doesn't act with a hover
[16:29:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:29:30] <Levin^> it acts when the mouse is scrolling
[16:29:35] <Levin^> it's a google map
[16:29:37] <Levin^> look:
[16:30:00] <robertmaxrees> $(opacidadeMapa).hover(function(e) {  is for hovering with a mouse.
[16:30:10] <robertmaxrees> it's binding a listener to the element you want.
[16:30:22] <Levin^> I added that just to test the event trigger
[16:30:33] <robertmaxrees> so use it?
[16:30:34] <Levin^> a sec
[16:31:12] <Levin^> here: http://ldb.nacaodesign.com.br/nossas-lojas/
[16:31:16] <Levin^> in a practical usage
[16:31:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:31:35] <Levin^> when you are scrolling with the cursor hovering the google map, it will dim the map
[16:32:07] <robertmaxrees> dunno how this changes my advice...
[16:32:27] <Levin^> ok, let me think
[16:33:16] <Levin^> I don't see a relation between an event being triggered with scroll and a hover
[16:33:26] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating two different events.
[16:33:35] <robertmaxrees> $(opacidadeMapa).hover( binds an event handler to hover.
[16:33:52] <Levin^> I made that hover just for testing
[16:33:52] <robertmaxrees> you asked about binding an event listener using hover.
[16:34:01] <robertmaxrees> so where's the question?
[16:34:22] <Levin^> how to listen to an event changing an element?
[16:34:27] <robertmaxrees> you don't want that.
[16:34:31] <Levin^> why?
[16:34:37] <robertmaxrees> you can do it, but it's inefficient and not really what you want.
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> do you want to know how to bind a listener to the hover of a pin?
[16:35:38] <Levin^> no, I want to change the color of the text "Digite o endereço ou CEP" when the map is darkened
[16:35:49] <Levin^> and come back after it's bright again
[16:36:01] <robertmaxrees> so what causes the map to darken?
[16:36:12] <Levin^> good question
[16:36:17] <Levin^> scroll?
[16:36:26] <Levin^> I don't really know
[16:36:41] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/events
[16:36:44] <robertmaxrees> did you read any of this?
[16:37:20] <Levin^> good
[16:37:25] <Levin^> thanks, that will hep lots
[16:37:28] <Levin^> help*
[16:38:23] <Levin^> weirdly it's not highlighting the event there...
[16:38:30] <robertmaxrees> read some more./
[16:38:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:38:39] <Levin^> yea, I will
[16:59:34] <cryptopsy> does jq offer a function for some animation to play when the user clicks any link?
[16:59:49] <cryptopsy> like a loading meter to show the link was clicked and is loading
[17:01:26] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy usually you hide whatever element you want and then remove the hide class when you click on a linkl.
[17:01:54] <cryptopsy> you mean unhide when a link is pressed and then when the new page has loaded its back to hide
[17:01:58] <cryptopsy> tnx
[17:02:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i wouldn't do that for a normal pageload.
[17:02:37] <cryptopsy> what would you do?
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> nothing.  users are used to pages having to load.  unless it's taking an inordinate amount of time.  in which case I'd fix that problem instea.d
[17:04:27] <cryptopsy> sometimes i wonder if my site is malfunctioning or if i didnt press the mouse button hard enough
[17:04:41] <cryptopsy> this causes problems a lot on payment sites, because sometimes it takes like 1+ minute for a payment to go through
[17:04:57] <cryptopsy> so they have load meters to show that its actually processing something and that the user shouldnt keep clicking it
[17:05:10] <cryptopsy> this happens in forums too. long load, the user panick and causes multiple posts
[17:05:19] <robertmaxrees> i work in ecom - familiar with that issue.
[17:06:09] <cryptopsy> what do you think, its not worth having a load meter?
[17:06:27] <cryptopsy> i've seen discrete ways to show progress, like faded white bubbles flowing across the screen
[17:06:44] <cryptopsy> or page turns slightly grayer
[17:07:02] <robertmaxrees> we handle it two ways - the first (and most important) is that your backend should recognize that it's a duplicate order placement and reject all subsequent ones.
[17:07:17] <robertmaxrees> we also change the button to a loading state and disable it.
[17:08:18] <cryptopsy> you disable further mouse behavior from taking place?
[17:08:24] <robertmaxrees> on that button.
[17:08:34] <cryptopsy> oh then you just disable the button
[17:08:45] <cryptopsy> how will the user know though?
[17:08:52] <robertmaxrees> "we also change the
[17:08:52] <robertmaxrees> button to a loading state
[17:09:05] <robertmaxrees> as in, when we disable, we change it to say "Loading..."
[17:09:20] <robertmaxrees> but that first part is more important fwiw - your backend should recognize it as a dupe.
[18:01:00] <FishPencil> How should I build a url based on multiple <input> elements? Basically for each $("#form input").val() add to $u with .attr("name") being in the form name=val. I think a join could be used with "&" somewhere
[18:03:16] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil just set it to method="get" in the html and let the form submit happen.
[18:03:46] <FishPencil> I'm looking to do AJAX though?
[18:03:56] <robertmaxrees> then why do you need a URL?
[18:04:09] <FishPencil> It's a GET request?
[18:04:47] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[18:04:53] <robertmaxrees> this not giving you what you want?
[18:05:31] <FishPencil> uhh nope, I just wasn't aware of that
[18:05:39] <robertmaxrees> :)(
[18:05:51] <FishPencil> this changes everything
[18:06:18] <FishPencil> Is this a "usual" way to do things? I'm not super familiar with using AJAX
[18:06:55] <robertmaxrees> i mean, iot'
[18:06:57] <robertmaxrees> *it's one way.
[18:07:01] <robertmaxrees> it kind of depends on the case.
[18:08:25] <FishPencil> I got back and forth on when to use AJAX and when to have the server generate the page
[18:09:22] <FishPencil> It seems like most pages use the sever end  to generate JSON data in the <script> which is then used to make AJAX requests based on those vars
[18:09:43] <robertmaxrees> that all really depends on what you're doing./
[18:10:09] <robertmaxrees> if you're looking to do a single-page application style setup, you really want to look into frameworks to handle all of that for you.
[18:10:48] <FishPencil> I have a simple page with some inputs that control what a backend query will do. The query then will return the data and it will be generated in a table
[18:11:04] <robertmaxrees> THat's pretty basic, then.
[18:11:39] <FishPencil> I have the server doing the GET->JSON in the initial load and the JS doing the AJAX and JSON->table markup
[18:11:48] <FishPencil> IDK if there's a better way here
[18:12:03] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:12:15] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're doing 2 calls for that data on pageload.
[18:13:27] <FishPencil> robertmaxrees: Would you just dump the data into JSON in the script and let the JS do the markup?
[18:14:16] <robertmaxrees> that depends on a whole variety of factors.
[18:15:34] <FishPencil> But yes, the AJAX request is another call, but doing it that way enables me to load further table data without reloading the whole page
[18:15:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:16:44] <robertmaxrees> your pageload is hitting your DB twice ;)
[18:17:03] <robertmaxrees> either way, what's the compelling reason to use AJAX here?
[18:17:05] <FishPencil> no?
[18:17:27] <FishPencil> The query is only run once
[18:17:50] <robertmaxrees> you just said you're running it once on pageload and then you immediately do an ajax call, no?
[18:18:58] <FishPencil> robertmaxrees: The initial page load is a GET request with the server taking the GET vars and simply dumping them into the script body in JSON. The client side script then loads those vars and uses those to make an AJAX request for the initial table load
[18:20:01] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[18:21:50] <FishPencil> There's a ton of ways this could be done, in varying proportions of server/client loading. I just don't know which is best
[18:22:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:22:14] <robertmaxrees> it's almost impossible for anybody to answer that for you.
[18:23:18] <FishPencil> Does the way I described seem reasonable
[18:24:25] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i dunno.  i still don't know very much about your setup.
[18:24:56] <robertmaxrees> for instance: why do you think you need ajax?>
[18:25:17] <FishPencil> I think it's cleaner
[18:26:11] <FishPencil> It's also the most optimized way of doing things from a load perspective
[18:26:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:26:24] <robertmaxrees> that's a loaded statement :)
[18:26:36] <FishPencil> pun intended
[18:26:42] <robertmaxrees> nah ;)
[18:27:04] <robertmaxrees> but f'serious, really you want to create a basic shell page and then use a client-side framework to handle the rest.
[18:27:08] <robertmaxrees> templating and all.
[18:27:21] <bussell> "it's very........ web 2.0"
[18:29:26] <FishPencil> Does jquery support a way to take a url and split it into the variables/values?
[18:30:25] <robertmaxrees> not really.  but why would you need that?
[18:31:17] <FishPencil> I could do away with the server side GET->JSON by parsing the url directly
[18:31:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd find a framework at that point.
[18:33:41] <FishPencil> A framework isn't always the solution :)
[18:36:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:36:16] <robertmaxrees> neither is ajax but here we are.
[20:28:46] <Al_nz1> anyone seen a plugin to do a dynamic filter on a table, similar to this https://datatables.net/examples/api/multi_filter_select.html but where you type in the filter rather than dropdown
[20:29:42] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for a filter for datatables?
[20:30:53] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: this is darn close to what I want to do : https://jsfiddle.net/ckmuc/83n1uxsd/7/
[20:31:44] <Al_nz1> the first column is any text filtering (not dropdown). The only change I would be looking to make to that implimentation would be that you type as much as you want and hit enter before it queries the backend
[20:36:58] <robertmaxrees> is it for datatables?
[20:37:45] <robertmaxrees> because https://datatables.net/examples/plug-ins/range_filtering.html
[20:41:10] <Al_nz2> robertmaxrees: well my data is just in a table
[20:41:36] <Al_nz2> tbody etc
[20:42:29] <Al_nz2> I could probably write something myself since the front end just needs a text input area and when you click enter it sends the string to the backend which will send a new list to the frontend
[20:42:51] <Al_nz2> the text input in the header colum just needs some formatting
[20:42:59] <Al_nz2> maybe twitter bootstrap has something native
[20:43:12] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:45:23] <Al_nz2> robertmaxrees: see the "remove" cross in circle at the end of phone number in this image : https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jtBr.png
[20:46:17] <Al_nz2> think of a text input, where after you type in a string, and click enter you get the word hilighted with the remove icon next to it,so you can add remove each word as a text filter
[20:47:52] <Al_nz2> each search string would have its own "remove" glyphicon next to it
[20:48:56] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:49:02] <robertmaxrees> you're querying your backend, right?
[20:49:07] <Al_nz2> yes
[20:49:39] <robertmaxrees> why not just send that to your backend and then have it ship back JSON and rerender the table?
[20:51:43] <Al_nz2> yes I realised thats the approach I should take
[20:51:53] <Al_nz2> but I need to have a UI in the front end
[20:52:02] <Al_nz2> that I would like to work like this:
[20:53:27] <Al_nz2> above each colum you have a text input, lets say the user types in "Banana" <ENTER> "Apples" <ENTER> then the word Apple and Banana would both be in the text area and each word would have there own red circle with a X in it, so you could add and remove the each string as a filter
[20:53:35] <Al_nz2> hope that make sense?
[20:54:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:54:39] <robertmaxrees> so you want tags?
[20:55:07] <Al_nz2> robertmaxrees: I am not sure what you mean by tags in this context
[20:55:26] <robertmaxrees> you want to be able to filter by groups of keywords per column.
[20:55:30] <robertmaxrees> but that's a little more complex.
[20:55:40] <robertmaxrees> because there's all kinds of logic you have to account for in that.,
[20:56:35] <Al_nz2> robertmaxrees: after the user hits enter it needs to send the key words to the backend
[20:56:46] <Al_nz2> the backend decides what goes back to the user
[20:57:33] <Al_nz2> So Apples ENTER sends Apples,then if the user also types Banana ENTER (after apples) I guess it would need to send Apples and Banana to the backend as the backend is not tracking the UI state
[20:58:40] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:58:59] <robertmaxrees> so what's the logical operation for "BANANAS" and "APPLES"?
[20:59:03] <robertmaxrees> is it AND?  OR?
[20:59:26] <Al_nz2> good point
[20:59:31] <robertmaxrees> Why not just build out a basic search filter for now?
[21:00:02] <robertmaxrees> start simple
[21:00:07] <Al_nz2> make it OR
[21:00:20] <Al_nz2> but thats all dealt with in backend
[21:00:32] <robertmaxrees> lol./
[21:00:35] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[21:00:47] <robertmaxrees> you bind a simple form submit handler, ajax it, rerender the table.
[21:00:48] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[21:01:41] <Al_nz2> hmm
[21:01:55] <rabidus> apples and bananas have same parent, fruit
[21:02:02] <Al_nz2> so first step would be create a input that when i hit enter it binds the icon to the string
[21:02:05] <rabidus> *has
[21:02:07] <rabidus> fuck
[21:02:08] <Al_nz2> step 2 send the string?
[21:02:22] <rizonz> are there lovely and mad people around ?
[21:02:40] <robertmaxrees> "binds the icon to the string"?
[21:02:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd just start simple, duder.
[21:02:53] <rizonz> it seems so
[21:02:55] <robertmaxrees> make a basic text input.
[21:02:59] <Al_nz2> ok...
[21:03:09] * rizonz waves @ robertmaxrees ;)
[21:03:15] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[21:03:17] <Al_nz2> I need to not send anything until enter
[21:03:23] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz2 that's fine.
[21:03:29] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use a submit handler.
[21:03:37] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: all fine, there ?
[21:03:46] <robertmaxrees> rizonz eh.
[21:03:57] <Al_nz2> brb
[21:03:58] <rizonz> KindOne: where did you leave the other Kind ?
[21:04:34] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: that sounds like you are having a heavy day and cannot find out yet why... try a coffee ;)
[21:04:51] <robertmaxrees> life ain't that simple rizonz ;)
[21:07:32] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: KISS ;)
[21:07:37] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[21:07:59] <rizonz> left,right, forward but never backwards!
[21:08:10] <robertmaxrees> moving on
[21:08:14] <rizonz> indeed
[21:08:19] <rizonz> you are a real man
[21:08:36] <robertmaxrees> can we drop it now?>
[21:08:48] <rizonz> like me today struggling in the pool with my my legs in to the mug up to my knees
[21:08:52] <rizonz> yes
[21:08:57] * rizonz drops, sleep well!
[21:09:07] <rizonz> *mud
[21:14:08] <SlimmyJimmy> A website is trying to download 1.11.0 from jquery.com but it's not working. Is that still available?
[21:14:24] <robertmaxrees> SlimmyJimmy should be.  wha3t's the link they';re trying to use?
[21:14:40] <SlimmyJimmy> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js
[21:14:46] <robertmaxrees> working fine here.
[21:14:55] <SlimmyJimmy> Okay thanks, that's odd.
[21:14:59] <robertmaxrees> would the site in question happen to be using https?
[21:15:12] <SlimmyJimmy> No, it's AmericasBest.com
[21:15:56] <robertmaxrees> odd.  i'm not seeing any issues.
[21:18:04] <SlimmyJimmy> It finally just now worked for me
[21:18:45] <SlimmyJimmy> It took forever, maybe it's my cellphone network.
