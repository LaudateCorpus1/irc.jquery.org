[00:03:42] <shaundunne> you define _which at the global level, but that's not had ant assigned to it, therefore, when it gets re-assigned to which within the function, it remains undefined
[00:04:11] <shaundunne> all you have done is declare a variable in the global scope

[03:40:48] <xhoy> i have a application.js file, with a $.ready etcetc. This is a global js file, is there a way i can trigger this function to run when a ajax request is completed?
[03:41:02] <xhoy> the $.ajaxComplete() doesn't seem to work since there isn't an url

[04:09:06] <yuka> anybody has a good example where I could find a nice gallery system to port into my existing app. All I find is standalone
[04:09:13] <candicecold> is there any visual designer for jquery ui
[04:09:31] <jeremy-> themeroller
[04:09:41] <candicecold> is it a visual designer ?
[04:10:13] <jeremy-> try clicking 'themes' on jqueryui.com and see for yourself, its pretty good
[04:11:45] <candicecold> i need something like where i can drag components and place and align and resize them
[04:12:51] <ph88> anderskristo: i tried this, but didnt work :(
[04:13:40] <boytoy_> yuka: slidesjs.com or swipejs.com?
[04:13:57] <jeremy-> jquery resizable
[04:14:01] <jeremy-> jquery draggable
[04:14:10] <jeremy-> plugins
[04:14:30] <jeremy-> just works with the dom selectors like jquery, there are probably others that are more all encompassing that do a bunch of stuff
[04:15:15] <yuka> boytoy_ I need something that can display album containers. Not just normal slideshow
[04:15:35] <jeremy-> yuka: if you did a 2 minute google you would have so many options that your problem wouldnt be finding one, its selecting a good one
[04:15:39] <jeremy-> and they are probably all good
[04:15:48] <yuka> not really jeremy-
[04:15:52] <jeremy-> yes really
[04:15:52] <yuka> my google search of 30min
[04:16:01] <jeremy-> do you want jquery standalone or php jquery
[04:16:03] <yuka> shown alot ghood options but all of them as standalone apps
[04:16:04] <boytoy_> Live, thuggin' muggin' and plugin' yo' hoes
[04:16:06] <boytoy_> Windows rolled up tight gettin' gone on them mo's
[04:16:15] <jeremy-> jquery isotope
[04:16:16] <yuka> If you took 1 minute to actually read what i said
[04:16:19] <jeremy-> is the best in my opinion
[04:16:29] <boytoy_> jeremy-: or packery
[04:16:29] <jeremy-> i did read what you said, you are completely ignorant if you cant find a gallery on google
[04:16:29] <yuka> all of those I am using and know , and are not what I want
[04:16:51] <jeremy-> honestly, i was about to list you 20 good ones
[04:16:59] <jeremy-> but since you are abrupt about it no thanks
[04:17:04] <yuka> I checked all galleries
[04:17:06] <yuka> on google.
[04:17:11] <yuka> javascript and jquery
[04:17:12] <jeremy-> okay, theres no gallery, you are right
[04:17:14] <jeremy-> what was i thinking
[04:17:22] <yuka> all I find is standalone app
[04:17:24] <jeremy-> nobody has thought of making a gallery before that is easy to port into a website
[04:17:36] <yuka> never said that
[04:17:39] <yuka> I said i can't find it
[04:17:42] <boytoy_> hehe
[04:17:43] <yuka> and want a recommendation
[04:17:47] <boytoy_> whats going down here, ease down fellas :p
[04:17:51] <yuka> he is a jerk
[04:17:53] <boytoy_> * going on
[04:17:57] <yuka> and I cba to deal with jerks
[04:18:00] <yuka> "google there is alot"
[04:18:01] <boytoy_> :D
[04:18:03] <yuka> well gimme a link then
[04:18:04] <yuka> asshole
[04:18:07] <jeremy-> i was starting to help you, and you were like "if you took 1 minute to read what i said"
[04:18:11] <jeremy-> thats not how you ask for help moron
[04:18:11] <yuka> you cant caus there isnt any
[04:18:13] <jeremy-> gtfo
[04:18:15] <yuka> you think your talking
[04:18:16] <yuka> to some noob
[04:18:17] <yuka> dude
[04:18:22] <yuka> I know what i am talking about
[04:18:33] <jeremy-> I listed you the best gallery plugin on the internet
[04:18:37] <yuka> isotope?
[04:18:38] <yuka> lol
[04:18:42] <yuka> you dont even know whats that.
[04:19:19] <yuka> I need a system that has a backend.. preferably written in EXTjs, that has album managment with containers etc.. not some plugin that displays pictures in a slideshow in frontend
[04:19:54] <jeremy-> there are plenty of pre-written backends for isotope and masonry
[04:20:03] <jeremy-> and this is a jquery channel, thus talks about jquery related matters
[04:20:19] <jeremy-> if you wanted pure javascript you are asking in the wrong place
[04:20:35] <jeremy-> or another framework
[04:21:25] <bealtine> x
[04:22:08] <dipser> i want a eierlegende wollmilchsau
[04:22:12] <boytoy_> yuka: https://github.com/gmanley/soshigal looks nice
[04:22:41] <ph88> im trying to do $('th').on('click', function () {  console.log('th click');  ....   but some other script is blocking access to the th click event ... how do i fix this ?
[04:23:05] <yuka> boytoy_ is there a demo page for it?
[04:23:18] <dipser> "anderskristo: or $('body').on('click', 'th', function() {})"
[04:24:00] <ph88> dipser:  i tried this... but that didnt work for me
[04:24:19] <boytoy_> yuka: no idea, best ask gmanley
[04:24:19] <ph88> i have now in my code:  $('body').on('click', 'th', function () {   console.log('th click');   .... more stuff
[04:25:47] <dipser> fiddle it
[04:26:01] <jeremy-> do you have an element inside the handler at a higher nested level that is blocking it
[04:26:15] <jeremy-> use a dom selector and make sure you are dealing with the right element
[04:26:21] <jeremy-> (chrome inspector)
[04:26:30] <xhoy> what event is fired Afther ajax the content is loaded?
[04:26:51] <xhoy> when i do a ajaxComplete, the content isn't in the dom so i cant select it with $(xyz)..?
[04:27:20] <jeremy-> thats another good one, i had that happen recently where i had to attach the onclick after the ajax success
[04:27:51] <dipser> do you have a soptPropagation anywhere? ph88
[04:28:00] <xhoy> i need to set some css, and there are a lot of questions about click, and you can use on, but on doesnt work for css :P
[04:28:16] <xhoy> $(document).on('change',
[04:28:25] <ph88> dipser: not me    the 3rd party script i use is this one:  https://github.com/akottr/dragtable/blob/master/jquery.dragtable.js
[04:30:39] <xhoy> mm that on change doesn't work!
[04:33:21] <xhoy> so how can i fire an event afther the ajax request is fully completed..
[04:33:29] <jeremy-> success
[04:33:48] <jeremy-> If you add the event handler in that i bet it would work too
[04:34:01] <xhoy> in where?
[04:34:02] <jeremy-> your problem is race condition with your dynamic table
[04:34:56] <jeremy-> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10264929/jquery-ajax-success
[04:35:35] <xhoy> problem is i use jquery tables, and the ajax stuff is auto generated
[04:35:51] <jeremy-> are you using datatables
[04:35:56] <xhoy> oke
[04:36:00] <jeremy-> you should use datatables instead and then add the draggable option
[04:36:02] <xhoy> tabs :P
[04:36:03] <xhoy> sorry
[04:36:39] <jeremy-> even so, jquery datatables will probably be better for what you need, and it has a click handler for the th even after you add draggable
[04:36:54] <xhoy> i dont drag anything...?
[04:36:55] <ph88> dipser: here is a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/NQEZZ/
[04:37:08] <xhoy> i press a tab, and then i need to fire an event :)
[04:37:24] <jeremy-> oh, shit, i was confusing yours with ph88
[04:37:33] <xhoy> aaah :P
[04:37:58] <jeremy-> are you using jquery ui tabs
[04:38:04] <xhoy> i use jquery tabs, and it loads perfectly but the ajaxComplete() is run before the content is reinsert in the dom
[04:38:07] <xhoy> yes
[04:38:17] <xhoy> i should look in the jquery tabs manual
[04:38:19] <xhoy> DAMM
[04:38:42] <jeremy-> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/
[04:39:56] <jeremy-> all you need to do is add a click handler to the tab li/a
[04:40:36] <ph88> jeremy-:  can you help me too ?
[04:40:44] <jeremy-> ph88: do what i was saying to xhoy, you should just use datatables instead
[04:40:56] <jeremy-> the problem is, that script doesnt have a click handler built in
[04:41:03] <jeremy-> and clicking the th triggers the drag event
[04:41:22] <jeremy-> with datatables, you have a click handler as well as the draggable functionality
[04:41:55] <xhoy> jeremy-: thanks, :)
[04:41:56] <jeremy-> hmm, actually, you should check first before you try it
[04:42:14] <jeremy-> http://datatables.net/release-datatables/extras/ColReorder/
[04:43:04] <jeremy-> not sure, i think it would be easier but as its actually an addon to the core datatables i cant even see a click handler in the documentation
[04:43:11] <jeremy-> you would need to make a test case
[04:43:31] <xhoy> i already had this fixed once for something else :P
[04:43:40] <xhoy> thanks anyway
[04:45:14] <humorous> how to post a byte array with ajax post? is this valid $.post(getURL(_hash), _encData, callback); ? where _encData is a byte array data i want in the post body
[04:45:15] <shmoon> hey guys
[04:45:21] <shmoon> i need some halp
[04:46:35] <shmoon> http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/assets/js/bootstrap-scrollspy.js has an event attached (but not defined) called 'scroll.scroll-spy.data-api' - what is it exactly?
[04:50:22] <dannydagger> hey guys.. how can I fade in a logo into the navbar when the navbar sticks to the top? http://www.colorworld.se/ddd/
[04:57:17] <jeremy-> has anybody got a good preference when it comes to extending jquery ui autocomplete for creating a 'tag list' or tokenized list
[04:58:06] <jeremy-> ie, you select something from jquery ui autocomplete and it adds to a visual UI indicator. I can see a bunch of alternatives
[04:59:45] <jeremy-> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/519107/jquery-autocomplete-tagging-plug-in-like-stackoverflows-input-tags thats a list from 2010, but thats very outdated today, hard to say which is going to continue recieving updates in parallel with jquery ui
[05:01:57] <humorous> is it possible to send raw post body with jquery post?
[05:02:22] <jeremy-> do you mean serializing the form?
[05:02:35] <jeremy-> then adding it to the data method
[05:35:40] <Tomashe> what is the jquery mobile channel?
[05:35:50] <arschmitz> #jquery
[05:36:15] <Tomashe> :)
[05:37:58] <Tomashe> i saw the video on appmobi vs jquery mobile
[05:38:05] <Tomashe> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUJiNoXje4
[05:38:12] <Tomashe> i personaly rather use jquery mobile
[05:38:21] <Tomashe> since i already know the lib funcitons and keys
[05:38:37] <Tomashe> any news about that, the issues have resolved already?
[05:39:24] <arschmitz> well the big difference is what they support
[05:39:40] <arschmitz> jqmobi does not support nearly the same number of platforms
[05:40:05] <xhoy> is there a jquery/javascript way of doing x = z ||= y (when z = null it sets y)
[05:40:44] <Tomashe> hmm
[05:41:02] <xhoy> ow when it isn't defined it just falls back to the default value
[05:41:13] <xhoy> i call a function with some arg's but i like to set de default :)
[05:41:14] <Tomashe> there is a jquerymobile way to create native based apps?
[05:41:23] <xhoy> function(x,y,z=2) but that doesn't work :)
[05:41:25] <arschmitz> yes phonegap
[05:41:35] <Tomashe> which is better?
[05:41:38] <Tomashe> then appmobi?
[05:41:52] <Tomashe> i heard some issues with phonegap
[05:42:26] <dannydagger> how can I fade in a logo into the navbar when the navbar sticks to the top? http://www.colorworld.se/ddd/
[05:44:32] <TuRnaD0> is it best to start with Jquery or javascript ?
[05:46:00] <arschmitz> Tomashe: i cant give you an unbiased opinion iv never used appmobi and im one of the developers of jQuery Mobile

[07:21:00] <ajmrsn> I'm using jquery mobile and phonegap and I'm trying to open links in phonegap's inappbrowser.  When I use $("#id a").each( function () { $(this).click( function (e) { e.preventDefault(); var target = $(this).attr('href'); window.open(target,'_blank','location=yes'); }); }); it does not apply the function to any links
[07:21:07] <ajmrsn> what am I doing wrong?
[07:25:14] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: Are you running it after the elements exist?
[07:26:48] <ajmrsn> I was trying to determine that just now, I have one bit of code attempting to get the element before they exist and another set of code that attempts to get the elements but is never executed
[07:26:53] <compact> hey, using AJAX to GET to a php script, but if i add die('test') in the php script, nothing shows?
[07:27:14] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: Try this instead: $(document).on('click', '#id a', function(e){ ... });
[07:27:26] <ajmrsn> ok
[07:28:13] <compact> http://pastebin.com/mm06cbab
[07:28:18] <compact> the alert('done') shows
[07:30:27] <BillCriswell> compact: What are you expecting to show up?
[07:30:56] <compact> in userdel.php ive tried die('test') and doesnt show
[07:31:05] <compact> tried <script>alert('test')</script>
[07:31:07] <compact> but doesnt show
[07:31:18] <compact> chanegd GEt to POST
[07:31:21] <BillCriswell> So your success function isn't calling back?
[07:31:28] <compact> nope its not :\
[07:31:55] <BillCriswell> Are you in Chrome? Open up the console and take a look at the network and see if the request for userdel.php does through.
[07:32:04] <BillCriswell> at the "Network" tab
[07:32:36] <compact> nope, cant see it in there :|
[07:32:48] <compact> actually i can
[07:32:48] <compact> sorry
[07:33:00] <compact> it shows the die message
[07:33:30] <BillCriswell> What's the status code? 200?
[07:33:45] <compact> yup
[07:34:18] <BillCriswell> success: function(response){ console.log( response ); } Should retrun "die" in that case.
[07:36:41] <ajmrsn> BillCriswell: $(document).on('click', '#id a', function () { â€¦ } ); did not work well
[07:37:04] <compact> go tit :D

[07:37:32] <compact> wasnt including the sql include files
[07:37:33] <compact> thanks
[07:38:02] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: Any type of error?
[07:38:58] <ajmrsn> oh not sure, I'm testing it on an ipod
[07:41:41] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/alawoq/2 does this work?
[07:43:00] <Nemesis13> how would you define the following?: an item of class .item, but not with parent of class .disabled
[07:44:36] <BillCriswell> div:not(.disabled) .item
[07:44:39] <BillCriswell> Nemesis13: ^^
[07:45:58] <Nemesis13> BillCriswell: sounds reasonable. but maybe it would be faster to check all .item for parent not matching .disabled
[07:46:04] <Nemesis13> let me check
[07:46:12] <Nemesis13> oh and thanks, btw
[07:46:53] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:47:07] <BillCriswell> Nemesis13: http://jsbin.com/ixuciy/1/edit this is how I tested it.
[07:47:29] <BillCriswell> I'm so glad jsbin has emmet enabled.
[07:47:31] <Nemesis13> not selector doesn't work in IE8 :-S
[07:47:55] <Nemesis13> BillCriswell: jsfiddle can emmet too :-)
[07:48:00] <BillCriswell> Not in CSS, in jQuery it'll work just fine.
[07:48:09] <dannydagger> pleeeeease someone:) how can I fade in a logo into the navbar when the navbar sticks to the top? http://www.colorworld.se/ddd/
[07:49:11] <Nemesis13> dannydagger: just place it there and make it opacity:0, then fade to 1
[07:49:20] <BillCriswell> Nemesis13: Yeah, definite. I just find myself in bin more.
[07:49:24] <BillCriswell> definitely*
[07:49:47] <dannydagger> Nemesis13: I really cant find the syntax to make it fade to 1 when navbar gets the class .sticky
[07:50:45] <Nemesis13> dannydagger: try it with transitions (http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_transitions.asp)
[07:52:07] <dannydagger> can i tell transitions to fadein when navbar=.sticky and fadeout when it releases sticky?
[07:52:52] <Nemesis13> maybe you could set another class on it and do something like: opacity 0 on .myclass and opacity 1 on .myclass.sticky
[07:53:32] <dannydagger> true.. gonna try thx
[07:55:05] <BillCriswell> dannydagger: You can reverse it I believe.

[08:16:18] <BillCriswell> You mentioned it and he left the channel.
[08:16:19] <blib> BillCriswell: Is there something wrong with this: $(document).ready(function() { 	$('dl').before('<hr>'); } -- I don't see the <hr> tags before the <dl> tags after load.
[08:17:33] <BillCriswell> Nope. There's something else going on. here's a quick demo blib: http://jsbin.com/ericiw/1/edit

[08:40:51] <blib> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/ericiw/1/edit - how can I turn "Foo" into a button using JQuery so that it acts as a toggle button to display Bar?
[08:41:08] <blib> I want to do this for all DLs present in the document
[08:42:13] <BillCriswell> blib: I'd just make it a button off the bat. Can't think of a good reason to have it as text then change it into a button.
[08:42:42] <blib> BillCriswell: In my case the DL/DTs are being generated automatically from RSTs using sphinx
[08:43:17] <BillCriswell> blib: It would basically work like.. http://jsbin.com/ericiw/3/edit

[08:47:37] <jop008> I have a form to do an upload
[08:48:10] <jop008> it doesn't work if I make a small sampel form html file my php is working so php is fine there must be something in html
[08:49:53] <BillCriswell> jop008: Can't just say it doesn't work. There's so many things that can be going wrong.
[08:50:30] <jop008> but my page is complete blank
[08:50:41] <jop008> I do a pastebin
[08:50:47] <BillCriswell> there you go.
[08:51:04] <BillCriswell> jsfiddle or jsbin might be better
[08:54:36] <jop008> this is my struggle http://pastebin.com/zjxEVwCa
[08:54:39] <DarkGhost`> why doesn't think work if ($(this).html() != "Date")  ?
[08:55:07] <jop008> so a vanilla form is okay but within a <div created by html not
[08:56:20] <blib> BillCriswell: Thanks. How do I make Foo toggled by default. Tried http://jsbin.com/ericiw/5/
[08:58:42] <DarkGhost`>             if ($(this).html() != "Date" || $(this).html() != "Actions")  { why does this not work?
[08:59:33] <BillCriswell> blib: Just hide it with CSS.
[09:02:21] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: You have to think about line breaks and things of that nature as well.
[09:02:21] <DarkGhost`> if i have a table and lets say I have <td></td> <td></td> and I have an .click() for each td is there a way I can find what number td that is?
[09:02:36] <DarkGhost`> BillCriswell well it works if i put the if's on two differnet lines but not together with an ||
[09:02:38] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: $(this).index()
[09:02:45] <DarkGhost`> thank you
[09:03:05] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: Sure you sure you don't want && ?
[09:03:33] <blib> BillCriswell: that worked, thanks
[09:03:39] <BillCriswell> blib: No problem.
[09:04:02] <BillCriswell> jop008: Your code if a bit to go through. I'd look through the console and see if there's any errors and try to narrow it down.

[09:07:43] <BillCriswell> jop008: The url variable.
[09:07:53] <jop008> yes

[09:13:19] <SergeyPenkin> How can I get window object using jQuery?
[09:13:22] <BillCriswell> jop008: You lost me.
[09:13:44] <pedda> but this does not work properly.. it's like i hover over something else (within my slideshow) and the controls disappear again..
[09:13:48] <jop008> how to pass the url
[09:13:50] <NoiseEee> jop008: replace "url" with the page you're directing the form to.
[09:14:08] <SergeyPenkin> Or how can I redirect to another page usng jQuery
[09:14:41] <BillCriswell> SergeyPenkin: No reason to use jQuery for that.
[09:14:58] <NoiseEee> SergeyPenkin: vanilla javascript, and a great question for The Google
[09:15:12] <BillCriswell> SergeyPenkin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/503093/how-can-i-make-a-redirect-page-in-jquery-javascript There you go.
[09:15:48] <SergeyPenkin> BillCriswell, there is a reson if window object is inaccessible
[09:16:18] <NoiseEee> SergeyPenkin: did you even try var w = $(window) ?
[09:17:36] <okdamn> why i'm unable to resize the images to 470x330 here ? http://jsfiddle.net/Fvdc7/
[09:18:38] <dogarrhea> jquery mobile is not on jsfiddle correct?
[09:18:54] <et09> how do i suppress the "Ajax error" dialog?
[09:19:15] <et09> i trying doing event.preventDefault() inside of $(document).ajaxError(function(event){ ... });
[09:21:52] <dogarrhea> how are you supposed to use https://github.com/filamentgroup/jQuery-Mobile-FixedToolbar-Legacy-Polyfill/blob/master/jquery.mobile.fixedToolbar.polyfill.js
[09:22:31] <jop008> I have to paas the URL
[09:23:03] <boytoy_> dogarrhea: why do you need that?
[09:23:16] <jop008> for a form submit
[09:23:19] <superdo> hi
[09:23:24] <jop008> it is for file upload form
[09:23:57] <dogarrhea> boytoy_: I am implementing a 500 year old idiom "The fly on the spyglass"  basically wherever someone points their "telescope" (client space) they will see the same fly no matter what zoom level or scrolling occurs
[09:24:05] <superdo> anyone met with bootstrap the following: if you close a modal, the grey transparent bg stays on the screen?
[09:24:33] <dogarrhea> too bad mobile web dev is a facking joke and a 500 year old idiom implemented 500 years ago simply by smashing a fly on a telescope lense is not possible without a sh*tton of work
[09:24:46] <boytoy_> dogarrhea: that sounds like a lotta fun :)
[09:24:53] <dogarrhea> yes
[09:24:57] <dogarrhea> position:fixed is facked
[09:25:08] <dogarrhea> it's poop
[09:25:32] <boytoy_> doesnt it work fine in the latest jquery mobile though?
[09:25:39] <boytoy_> fixed toolbars i mean
[09:26:01] <boytoy_> if they dont i need to know about it
[09:27:12] <dogarrhea> boytoy_: i'd ideally want the toolbar to remain the same size
[09:27:19] <dogarrhea> the "fly on the spyglass" idiom fits perfectly
[09:27:32] <dogarrhea> even if you zoom in and out, the fly is basically not going to change size
[09:28:04] <dogarrhea> if you zoom in super deep to see some content and want to access something on the tool bar, you have to zoom out again
[09:28:38] <dogarrhea> http://bradfrostweb.com/demo/fixed/index.html almost has everything i want except constant size fixed toolbar
[09:28:59] <jop008> it looks like the form is not launching the php file
[09:29:10] <jop008> although the url is changed
[09:29:48] <NoiseEee> jop008: you can't send files over traditional xhr/ajax
[09:29:56] <NoiseEee> jop008: you can try simulation via an iframe, or xhr2
[09:30:15] <jop008> but on windows it works like a charm
[09:30:24] <jop008> both run on xampp
[09:30:41] <jop008> and a vanilla form can upload my files
[09:30:52] <jop008> so there must be a solution
[09:30:59] <NoiseEee> jop008: yes vanilla can, i have no idea what your issue or problem is
[09:31:15] <jop008> upload files to a server
[09:31:36] <jaydev> Hi
[09:31:38] <jaydev> 		I have created a plugin
[09:31:39] <jop008> the page loads the url but elements shows html dom elements not the php action
[09:31:39] <jaydev> 		https://github.com/jaydevonline/jQuery-Nice-File-Input
[09:31:41] <jaydev> 		I want to add it to jquery plugin site
[09:31:42] <jaydev> 		please help me in that
[09:31:52] <jop008> so something to do with jquery
[09:31:53] <NoiseEee> jop008: what does that even mean
[09:32:06] <jop008> even mean?
[09:32:20] <NoiseEee> "the page loads the url but elements shows html dom elements not the php action" <-- wtf
[09:33:04] <jop008> so the url is showing php and the dom elements are not from php
[09:33:17] <jop008> looks like antother page
[09:34:18] <jop008> as if jquery holds the page and not firing the submit correctly
[09:34:37] <jop008> when I do a refresh of the page the codes get executed
[09:37:08] <boytoy_> dogarrhea: i think i want that too now that u mention it =)
[09:37:28] <dogarrhea> kek. what you want and what you get are 2 very different things in web dev world :(
[09:37:32] <dogarrhea> please let me know how it turns out
[09:37:40] <boytoy_> hehe
[09:37:44] <boytoy_> yea sure
[09:38:17] <NoiseEee> jop008: i think at the very least you need to post code somewhere that might help make sense of your issue.
[09:38:31] <okdamn> unbelievable how could it be possible?? http://jsfiddle.net/Fvdc7/
[09:38:37] <okdamn> it doesn't resize as i want
[09:38:39] <okdamn> :/
[09:39:50] <Krambiorix> hi, i'm trying to get the outer html of all tables with class "message" , but i get an empty string: http://pastebin.com/DP6wDrhL
[09:40:21] <jop008> I have already posted my code of course
[09:40:37] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/zjxEVwCa
[09:40:44] <jop008> look at <form
[09:41:02] <jop008> in the code that form is created by jscript
[09:42:01] <Saaether> Krambiorix $("table .message") should be $("table.message")
[09:42:10] <NoiseEee> jop008: holy christ jop008, maybe a reduced example? have no idea what all that code does, and nobody is going to be reviewing 518 lines of code to help someone
[09:42:33] <jop008> the reduced example is @ the top
[09:42:37] <jop008> working okay
[09:42:39] <ColKurtz> I think it's about time I dropped jquery validate and tried out an HTML5 form validation polyfill. Any suggestions on a high-quality lib/plugin for that purpose?
[09:42:49] <jop008> the form is created with one function
[09:42:52] <jop008> easy to find
[09:43:03] <jop008> create_uploadform
[09:43:14] <jop008> this code is always run wo condtions
[09:43:22] <jop008> so clear enough
[09:43:41] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: jQuery doesn't have an outerHTML. You would need to do this.outerHTML, not $(this).outerHTML
[09:43:46] <NoiseEee> okay, what about it (and why arent you using jquery methods for stuff?)
[09:44:25] <DonkeyCongo> Ben Alman's .hashchange() plugin does not work for newer versions of jQuery. Anybody knows of an alternative?
[09:45:23] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, that's it!
[09:45:24] <Krambiorix> thanks!
[09:46:43] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Welcoem.
[09:48:06] <boytoy_> Is there a way to open a jQuery Mobile page inside another jQuery Mobile page? http://jsbin.com/olohiy/2/edit (for desktop users, where some pages do not need to load in a full page)
[09:48:34] <arschmitz> boytoy_: short answer No
[09:48:44] <arschmitz> you would have to use iframes
[09:49:08] <boytoy_> Oooops iframes huh, not good.
[09:49:38] <boytoy_> arschmitz: I guess I could clone the page?
[09:52:37] <qkzoo> Hi. Cant seem to get ajax to work using jquery mobile, can someone tell me what thing(s) I,ve done wrong here? http://pastebin.com/yPvwe2p7
[09:54:25] <jop008> it looks like the form is submit in a kind of a jquery mapper
[09:55:14] <DonkeyCongo> Why do I get "Uncaught TypeError: boolean is not a function" whenever I try to include a jQuery plugin?
[09:55:42] <jop008> http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-07-22_at_6.54.34_PM-szUgHI3n.png
[09:55:46] <BillCriswell> DonkeyCongo: Any plugin or one plugin in particular?
[09:55:51] <jop008> here is my DOM showing after submit
[09:56:29] <DonkeyCongo> BillCriswell: Seems to be with any, right now. It shows with all the hashchange plugins Ive tried
[09:57:38] <qkzoo> Hi. Cant seem to get ajax to work using jquery mobile, can someone tell me what thing(s) I,ve done wrong here? http://pastebin.com/yPvwe2p7
[09:57:55] <doitux> hi, anyone here can help me flip the card in the right way so that the frontside (4 of clubs) is NOT mirrored? --> http://jsfiddle.net/skBer/2/
[09:59:13] <ajmrsn> for jquerymobile : I have this code inside of a documentReady() function http://dpaste.com/1313641/Â and I have $(document).on('pageshow', function(){ documentReady(); }); would this be executed every time a page is loaded?
[10:02:05] <dannydagger> how can i launch a transition when an element gets a new class through addClass?
[10:05:03] <ajmrsn> I also have an alert() inside of documentReady() but when I test this I never receive a popup
[10:05:28] <jop008> So on a page with jquery I do a form submit and code is not executed php is not fired on a straight page witth same form definition the form is usbmited ok
[10:05:32] <jop008> so how to debug this
[10:06:02] <ajmrsn> jop008: if it's not jquery mobile then I would say look in to your javascript console
[10:06:23] <jop008> the console shows nothing special
[10:06:42] <jop008> I can trigger the onclikc event on the submit
[10:06:44] <jop008> but then?
[10:07:03] <jop008> what to do on clic submit to pass the file info
[10:07:39] <ajmrsn> are you setting the frm_elem.action = "submit.php";
[10:07:50] <jop008> <form action =
[10:07:53] <jop008> like this
[10:08:06] <jop008> must I use .action?
[10:08:45] <ajmrsn> maybe, it's a guess
[10:08:59] <jop008> I now use this in clikc submit  $form.attr("action", "./actions/fileupload.php?objectID=" + objectID);
[10:09:07] <ajmrsn> you might want to try using .ajax to avoid .submit()
[10:10:49] <jop008> so after a submit it looks like php is fired but checking the dom elemetns it is something completely diffrerent
[10:12:18] <jop008> <div data-role="page" data-url="/rental/actions/fileupload.php?objectID=20025" data-external-page="true" tabindex="0" class="ui-page ui-body-c ui-page-active" style="min-height: 729px;"></div>
[10:12:24] <jop008> iis in the dom elements
[10:12:44] <jop008> looks like a kind of laucher
[10:13:03] <jop008> since the php file is mentioned as well
[10:16:32] <jop008> so jqmobile does n't do a plain handle over to the php file
[10:16:42] <jop008> it looks like an extra step in between
[10:20:00] <jop008> SOmething todo with this http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html
[10:25:51] <dogarrhea> http://jsfiddle.net/63YHA/  This is my attempt to make zoom stuff stay the same size..
[10:26:03] <dogarrhea> except it doesn't work in android. wut should i do?
[10:28:02] <jop008> So how to turn off the jqm behaviour of page loading
[10:28:13] <jop008> which happens on my submit
[10:30:18] <jop008> $.mobile.ajaxFormsEnabled = false;
[10:30:22] <jop008> no change
[10:31:45] <jop008> when I click on submit I see changes in the DOM structure
[10:31:59] <jop008> but actual php is not touched
[10:32:03] <defk0n> Does anyone know how to encode javascript into a json string?
[10:32:26] <drag0nius> how would  i enable slider after disabling it?
[10:32:53] <defk0n> especially a javascript with lots of quotes. like for example jquery library.
[10:33:17] <tw2113> JSON.stringify() ?
[10:33:23] <blindMoe|2> drag0nius: just re-enable it?  I guess that would depend on what you mean by "disabling" as well
[10:33:58] <defk0n> yeah but i need to make it a string first, if its javascript with lots of quotes that wont happen
[10:34:08] <defk0n> ineed some sort of safe encoding. like binary or what have you.
[10:34:18] <drag0nius> $slider.slider('options', 'disabled', true);
[10:34:22] <defk0n> that takes " ' / { } and make it into a  numeric valuue
[10:34:48] <blindMoe|2> drag0nius: look at the docs for whatever slider you are using
[10:35:00] <drag0nius> im using default jquery ui slider
[10:41:06] <dannydagger> how can i launch a transition when an element gets a new class through addClass?
[10:44:21] <BillCriswell> dannydagger: If you're using CSS transitions, nothing. If you're not you can use toggleClass() with jQuery UI
[10:44:41] <porton> Having td object, how to find its row and column in the table?
[10:45:00] <BillCriswell> porton: row would be $(this).parent()
[10:45:01] <dannydagger> BillCriswell: is there no way doing it without the uI?
[10:45:13] <BillCriswell> The "column" would be $(this).index() I think.
[10:45:38] <porton> BillCriswell: No, I want not to find the parent argument, but to know two numbers: the row and the column number of our <td>
[10:45:50] <BillCriswell> dannydagger: If you're using CSS transitions just doing .addClass('foo') would start the transition.
[10:46:13] <BillCriswell> porton: $(this).parent().index() and $(this).index()
[10:46:20] <dannydagger> BillCriswell: with or without the UI?
[10:46:37] <BillCriswell> You would NOT need jQuery UI to do it with CSS transitions.
[10:47:09] <dannydagger> Ah ok.. the thing is.. i want the logo to fade in on the navbar when the navbar gets sticky.. www.colorworld.se/ddd

[11:44:24] <phidah> I moved my jquery script src to the bottom of my file. I now need to use $ on the page, but my template doesn't allow me to move this specific js to the bottom of the file. Is there a way to delay the call to my function until $(document).ready without needing jquery?

[12:32:54] <nicolas_> hi
[12:35:00] <nicolas_> I'm doing a $.getJSON to a cross domain, i need to get a 200 response, but everything that i'm getting is a 400 error and only an error response can be managed, even if the code at the server is executed correctly.

[12:53:10] <CorySimmons> Hey guys, I'm using Harvest's Chosen plugin to make my select menu look a bit better, but the problem is, when I click on an option in it, I expect it to update the window.location and therefore "jump" to that section of the page. Instead, it works incredibly finicky. Any ideas?
[13:04:20] <pamere> Hi guys idea why this buttin requires a double click under IE ? jsfiddle.net/HAaFb/37
[13:04:20] <pamere> ?
[13:05:12] <SuRfDeMoN> is there an input field for currency ?
[13:06:07] <pamere> SuRfDeMoN if you are reffering to my question i dont think so
[13:07:40] <SuRfDeMoN> pamere: nope sorry im working on something that deals with money values
[13:07:52] <pamere> aw ok no probs
[13:08:18] <BillCriswell> SuRfDeMoN: You can use input type="number"
[13:08:32] <BillCriswell> and prepend the field with the currency symbol
[13:09:15] <SuRfDeMoN> BillCriswell: can the input prepend the currency symbol, inside the input box ?
[13:10:32] <BillCriswell> I meant put the symbol before, not prepend the field itself.
[13:18:08] <SuRfDeMoN> BillCriswell: cheers, so there isn't a control specifically for currency :(
[13:18:28] <BillCriswell> SuRfDeMoN: Don't believe so.
[13:18:39] <CorySimmons> So I have an action that's happening where it changes the window.location object (which will jump around the page from section to section). The problem is, I have an element that is supposed to do something if the user scrolls but since they don't scroll or anything after the page has jumped, it doesn't automatically trigger this action. Any ideas on an invisible way to cause some action on the page?
[13:19:14] <BillCriswell> CorySimmons: .trigger('scroll') maybe?
[13:20:41] <dogarrhea> I guess I will resign myself to knowing that doing fixed toolbar with  percentage width/height in mobile is not possible
[13:20:49] <dogarrhea> stupid android / mobile browsers
[13:21:20] <dogarrhea> http://www.pasteall.org/44279 this works fine in all desktop browsers
[13:21:25] <dogarrhea> i don't know what the mobile equivalent is
[13:22:21] <dogarrhea> there probably is none because mobile browser support for position:fixed is totally screwed up\
[13:22:51] <CorySimmons> BillCriswell: Appreciate it and it makes sense but I'm not sure what to bind it to
[13:26:20] <CorySimmons> Eh, can't seem to get it working. :(
[13:26:49] <CorySimmons> Ah wellâ€¦ so minor.
[13:27:05] <BillCriswell> I was typing up an answer for the dude.
[13:27:16] <BillCriswell> Oh well.
[13:27:49] <Expedion> Hi
[13:28:13] <BillCriswell> Just learned the scrollTop(200) triggers a scroll event.. for some reason I didn't think that would happen?
[13:28:20] <BillCriswell> Expedion: Yooooooo
[13:28:38] <Expedion> I've got a question, perhaps someone could help. It has to do with using inline content in a modal box
[13:28:51] <Expedion> There is a plugin for wordpress im using right now called OrangeBox
[13:29:08] <Expedion> And the creator of the plugin has some nifty examples of his use of OrangeBox
[13:29:36] <Expedion> There is 1 particular example that I need which is this one: http://orangebox.davidpaulhamilton.net/ (inline Content example)
[13:29:41] <Expedion> He uses multiple slides in his modal.
[13:29:53] <ravster> hey all
[13:30:11] <Expedion> And in his docs he explains the following things: http://orangebox.davidpaulhamilton.net/docs.html
[13:30:22] <dannydagger> hmm.. why is my jQuery behaving strange in chrome but perfect in firefox?
[13:30:37] <Expedion> He does show how to do inline content in the modal box but I can't figure out how he is able to do slides in the modal box.
[13:30:47] <Expedion> He talks about groups things like that but I have no idea on how I can improve on that
[13:30:48] <ravster> I'm having trouble with the html5sortable plugin.  Everytime I have the code with a .bind('sortupdate', function (){ foo};, the entire sortable functionality drops.
[13:30:54] <Expedion> Could anyone help me out on that?
[13:31:12] <Expedion> Hey BillCriswell :)
[13:33:29] <BillCriswell> Expedion: Documented weirdly. But basically look for links with lightbox[inline] on it. That "inline content" link is the same as clicking that "Feathers" link under "info & documents"
[13:33:46] <Expedion> Hmmmm BillCriswell
[13:33:56] <Expedion> Could you do a quick code on a modal with like 2 slides?
[13:34:08] <Expedion> I've been breaking my head for like almost 2 days now
[13:34:27] <Expedion> And since I'm fairly new to jQuery and stuff I have trouble grasping some things
[13:34:28] <dannydagger> www.colorworld.se/ddd   the jQuery which is animating the opacity change of the text in the hero feature acts wierd in chrome but works perfectly in firefox.. anyone got a clue why?
[13:35:13] <BillCriswell> Expedion: <a href="#slide1divID" rel="lightbox[inline]">Whatever</a> <a href="#slide2divID" rel="lightbox[inline]">Whatever</a> <a href="#slide4divID" rel="lightbox[inline]">Whatever</a>
[13:35:34] <BillCriswell> Then have three hidden divs with the ids of slide1divID, slide2divID, etc
[13:35:43] <Expedion> Hmmm
[13:35:47] <Expedion> What do you mean by that?
[13:35:58] <Expedion> Could you show an example on that please?
[13:36:08] <BillCriswell> This page is an example of it.
[13:36:12] <Expedion> The part you just explained I understand
[13:36:16] <Expedion> <a href="#slide1divID" rel="lightbox[inline]">Whatever</a> <a href="#slide2divID" rel="lightbox[inline]">Whatever</a> <a href="#slide4divID" rel="lightbox[inline]">Whatever</a>
[13:36:31] <Expedion> Now I need to figure out how to get them in the modal box as slides
[13:36:52] <BillCriswell> Then you have three hidden divs <div id="slide1divID">Slide One</div> <div id="slide2divID">Slide Two</div> <div id="slide3divID">Slide Three</div>
[13:38:17] <BillCriswell> His links are <a href="#support" rel="lightbox[inline]">, <a href="#changelog" rel="lightbox[inline]">, <a href="#features" rel="lightbox[inline]">, they accompany the divs <div id="support"></div> <div id="changelog"></div> and <div id="feathers"></div>
[13:41:07] <Expedion> Hmmmm
[13:41:44] <Expedion> Wait billcriswell
[13:41:48] <Expedion> Let me set up piratenpad or something
[13:41:50] <Expedion> Sec
[13:42:00] <BillCriswell> I've explained it already.
[13:42:30] <Expedion> Billcriswell: http://piratenpad.de/v9im1oeOwL
[13:43:17] <BillCriswell> You have all the pieces to solve it.
[13:44:19] <Expedion> BillCriswell, is that link working for ya mate?
[13:44:28] <BillCriswell> I didn't click it.
[13:44:33] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/bkpX8/ Here's a barebones demo.
[13:45:25] <CorySimmons> Ok, I'm using http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/ at http://pressedweb.com/bc/centers When I click on the "Alaska" or "Arizona" first, nothing. When I click on "Alabama" it's like Chosen decides to wake up and start working correctly. It jumps to the right section, and every time I click on "Alaska" or "Arizona" after that, it works fine. No console errors. Any idea guys? :(
[13:46:17] <Expedion> BilLCrisWell Ok
[13:47:14] <Itrace> Can I run a function in .prepend()? For example: is this correct: "â€¦ $element.prepend( functionName(x,y) )   ..."
[13:48:09] <BillCriswell> Itrace: You'd have to do like $element.prepend(function(){ return functionName(x,y); });
[13:48:16] <Expedion> BillCrisWell, the sliders work! However it also displays the content on the page as well: http://gyazo.com/11b0a3e8c5665748d57a096928352a1b
[13:48:27] <BillCriswell> Expedion: Hide them.
[13:49:43] <Itrace> billCriswell: Thanks. I'm doing that now, but I'm still getting errors so I think something else is going on. Thanks anyway.
[13:49:59] <Expedion> BillCrisWell, that .slide { display: none; } do I just put that between <style></style>?
[13:50:09] <BillCriswell> Expedion: Yes.
[13:50:17] <BillCriswell> Better yet, in your stylesheet.
[13:50:41] <BillCriswell> Itrace: What does functionName(x,y) return?
[13:51:14] <Itrace> BillCriswell: Here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/thjW2/8/  It returns an array.
[13:51:19] <Expedion> BillCrisWell (K)
[13:52:11] <Expedion> BillCrisswell, I don't want to deisplay slide 2 and 3, I just want it to have 1 link with the 3 slides in them
[13:52:16] <Expedion> BillCriswell
[13:52:32] <BillCriswell> Itrace: return addZeros( num, 5 ).join('')
[13:53:01] <Itrace> BillCriswell: You ROCK! that did it
[13:53:10] <Expedion> Billcriswell: So now it's like this: http://gyazo.com/e5bce3367657392c2af45a3d5396f0d9 but I want it only to show slide 1 and then when you click it, it slides through the 3 slides
[13:53:57] <BillCriswell> Expedion: Just hide the other links.
[13:54:10] <BillCriswell> Expedion: http://jsfiddle.net/bkpX8/1/ quick update
[13:54:20] <Expedion> Billcriswell and for some reason those slides are not popping up when i click on em
[13:57:07] <scar> how useful would the virtual trainings advertised on jquery be at appendto.com ? http://appendto.com/training/jquery-virtual-training-july-2013/
[13:58:13] <BillCriswell> Itrace: Glad it worked.
[14:01:07] <amph1bius|ghost> appendto looks ancient
[14:01:12] <amph1bius|ghost> i would be hesistant to register
[14:04:21] <scar> amph1bius|ghost, i only asked bc someone offered to pay
[14:04:29] <scar> but i still dont think itd be worth it but figured id ask here
[14:05:28] <Fjerpje> Hi
[14:05:49] <BillCriswell> Being able to Jump from JavaScript and jQuery Foundations to Advanced jQuery Techniques in 5 hours sounds pretty optimistic.
[14:06:18] <Fjerpje> Can someone help me out with a issue?
[14:06:18] <BillCriswell> 4 hours even.
[14:07:19] <myhrlin> Fjerpje: depends first on the issue
[14:08:25] <BillCriswell> Later on everyone.
[14:08:29] <Fjerpje> Well, i have a script to reset certain form elements to their initial state which is triggered by a radiogroup within the same form
[14:11:30] <amph1bius|ghost> whats the problem
[14:11:54] <Expedion> Billcriswell when I utilize the code you gave it doesn't show the links at all
[14:12:09] <Expedion> However if I delete the style, all of a sudden they display again
[14:12:20] <amph1bius|ghost> lets see an example
[14:13:26] <dannydagger> http://ollysorsby.co.uk/ is he using any plugin to make the herotext lose opacity on scroll?
[14:13:47] <Expedion> Billcriswell, almost there mate. Just the style is screwing up
[14:14:42] <tomato> ummm just installed ie10.. and thunder and lightening came from nowhere... is that normal?
[14:16:32] <amph1bius|ghost> dannydagger: line 84 of theme_trust.js
[14:16:39] <amph1bius|ghost> 'opacity' : 1-(scrollPos/300)
[14:16:55] <Expedion> Billcriswell, FIXED IT :)
[14:17:25] <Expedion> Just had to change that class id to a different name, slide appearently was intervening with another .slide thats already in my style.css
[14:17:34] <Expedion> BIllcriswell, however it is still displaying the links:
[14:18:08] <Expedion> Billcriswell: http://gyazo.com/a6b224dc16343dc517b56631c59b7d30
[14:18:31] <Expedion> And my code looks like this: http://gyazo.com/a5b9634030c561fde725c8921e80a467
[14:22:55] <Expedion> Billcriswell, I also won't be using <li> function on my site
[14:23:00] <dogarrhea> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html why doesn't this functionality work on Android 2.3???
[14:23:02] <Expedion> Could you please show me to fix the issue? :)
[14:23:39] <dogarrhea> http://www.pasteall.org/44280 is the code that I am using to attempt to get fixed toolbars.
[14:23:56] <dogarrhea> except it doesn't work on 2.3.3.  I guess this is just another bug in jquery mobile :/
[14:24:08] <dogarrhea> stock browser
[14:24:28] <amph1bius|ghost> dogarrhea: because position: fixed isn't supported
[14:24:47] <dogarrhea> amph1bius|ghost: well, the library is supposed to work around that
[14:24:57] <dogarrhea> but somehow the library is broken in android 2.3.3 stock browser
[14:25:04] <dogarrhea> so.... that means the library is broken
[14:26:20] <Expedion> Billcriswell, this is my solution to that problem: http://gyazo.com/9ed2f5645c6e90e69207eb7b1b60df39
[14:26:36] <Expedion> I basically deleted the link text on the other last 2
[14:26:40] <dogarrhea> yea. even the demo page that I linked above is broken in android 2.3.3
[14:26:45] <Expedion> Would that be retarded improvisation?
[14:33:00] <Bor> can somebody help me with a sript that automatically sort <ul> lists alfabetically?
[14:34:20] <blib> I'm looking to display 100+ high resolution images (with thumbnails) on the browser. Any suggestions for a good image viewer? I'd like most of the work done in js/css/html.
[14:35:29] <amph1bius|ghost> there are a plethora of gallery plugins
[14:36:06] <dogarrhea> bah
[14:36:16] <dogarrhea> the behavior of that jquery fixed toolbar is so bad
[14:36:50] <Bor> I pay the helper
[14:37:11] <dogarrhea> how much? 1$?
[14:37:21] <amph1bius|ghost> any position fixed toolbar will give you problems on mobile
[14:38:11] <Bor> i let the creator deside
[14:47:17] <dogarrhea> amph1bius|ghost: it's not position fixed.
[14:47:26] <dogarrhea> amph1bius|ghost: it's not position: fixed
[14:47:57] <jaynewstrom> Bor - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1134976/how-may-i-sort-a-list-alphabetically-using-jquery

[15:08:38] <dogarrhea> ARGH

[15:18:27] <Fjerpje> I can't figure out why it's doing that since my jQuery knowledge is lacking

[15:29:05] <Expedion> <div id="button"><a href="#contentlocker1" rel="lightbox[group]" data-ob_caption="This is the caption" title="TEST"</a></div>
[15:29:16] <tw2113> i've had a lot of slider success in general with jQuery cycle
[15:29:20] <Expedion> Is there a way to change the title size in CSS=
[15:29:26] <Expedion> ?
[15:30:02] <Expedion> Because doing this instead kind of screws the code on my site: title="<h6>TEST</h6>"
[15:30:19] <Expedion> The title is for my modal lightbox popup
[15:32:21] <Fjerpje> You can change anything in css
[15:32:32] <Fjerpje> what do you need? Expedion
[15:32:39] <tw2113> i'd check to see if the lightbox popup puts it in its own dom element dynamically
[15:32:53] <Expedion> Basically this is the code i have so
[15:32:55] <Expedion> far
[15:34:28] <Expedion> s

[15:35:22] <Dorf>  what does .ajax append to the url for GET?
[15:35:48] <amph1bius|ghost> the query parameters ?
[15:36:12] <Fjerpje> you could post
[15:36:29] <Fjerpje> by default it gets
[15:37:12] <Dorf> i'm just curious for the server side what i should set it to look for
[15:37:55] <tw2113> if you're using .ajax for a GET request, you just point to the url you want the data back from
[15:37:58] <tw2113> and then work with it
[15:38:12] <tw2113> if you're using it to POST data to be manipulated and then returned
[15:38:16] <Expedion> Fjerpje: http://jsfiddle.net/bkpX8/6/
[15:38:28] <tw2113> then on the server side, say you're using php...you grab the $_POST global
[15:39:09] <Dorf> i'm entering a zip code in a form, sending it to a php script to run a query to list all cities with that zip code and returning the information in json
[15:39:26] <tw2113> then you are posting data
[15:39:29] <tw2113> use $_POST
[15:39:40] <tw2113> unless of course...hmm
[15:39:49] <tw2113> is the form set to post or get?
[15:40:27] <tw2113> Fjerpje, i don't do private message support

[15:49:50] <Skullclown> we're currently using .children().map(function() { ... }).get() so it seemed counterproductive to use a loop afterwards?

[16:05:29] <Fjerpje> Any experienced jQuery coder arround?
[16:05:59] <Skullclown> Fjerpje: you're more likely to get an answer if you just ask your question
[16:07:45] <Fjerpje> I have script: http://jsfiddle.net/hv6zP If you press the "test" button under the form, all of the form elements get reset to their initial state. But when you press a second time on the same button, it removes all of the elements and theres my problem! I can't figure out why it's doing that. I need it to reset certain form elements by a radiogroup within the same form without resetting the main radiogroup
[16:07:58] <Fjerpje> Theres my question!
[16:09:43] <Fjerpje> The script needs  to reset certain form elements to their initial state which is triggered by a radiogroup within the same form
[16:10:53] <Fjerpje> The script does what i want it when you press the button onces, but not when you press it twice because it removes the elements and that's not what i want.
[16:13:23] <Fjerpje> Anyone can help out?
[16:16:43] <Fjerpje> No one available?
[16:17:29] <Fjerpje> bah

[16:39:13] <DonkeyCongo> When I do .focus() on an input, it selects all the text. Any way to get around that?
[16:41:48] <wer0ckz> help please. html() is not working - http://pastebin.com/2X8g8JhW
[16:42:51] <wer0ckz> <div class="content2"> </div> <-- exist in my html file
[16:42:56] <wer0ckz> any ideas?
[16:51:15] <Dorf> so jquery doesn't have if/else?
[16:51:53] <trollwork> Dorf, no, javascript does
[16:52:08] <nesoi> anyone know a lazy loader for lists that works in JQM in a reverse direction? (ie: scrolls from the bottom up)?
[16:52:27] <Dorf> alright.  how do i check for an undefined ajax return?
[17:15:32] <nesoi> so no JQM people here?
[17:16:00] <offlim> im trying to add a % sign to the end of the text in a input field
[17:16:07] <offlim> how would i do that?
[17:16:24] <nesoi> why would you do that offlim?
[17:16:47] <nesoi> and when would you do it?
[17:17:15] <nesoi> after input? on every character?
[17:18:00] <nesoi> how about putting a % sign to the right of the textbox and right justifying the text
[17:18:27] <offlim> i have a input file for people to insert the perent numbe like 25%.. i always want the 1 percent sign at the end like 1% 20% 100%
[17:18:41] <nesoi> yeah, don't make it part of the textbox
[17:18:52] <nesoi> [textbox]%
[17:19:01] <offlim> i need it in the textbox
[17:19:03] <nesoi> with right justified text
[17:19:21] <nesoi> why?
[17:19:47] <offlim> because theres not enough room for it to be outside the input
[17:19:53] <nesoi> um
[17:19:58] <nesoi> if there's room for it in the input
[17:20:02] <nesoi> there's room for it outside the input
[17:20:12] <nesoi> make the input 1 char smaller
[17:20:12] <nesoi> duh
[17:21:05] <offlim> no, its part of a form. i need it inside the box
[17:21:13] <nesoi> no you don't
[17:21:47] <nesoi> you can have text outside of a textbox in a form
[17:22:02] <offlim> anyone else here know how to add the percent sign at the end of the text inside of a input field?
[17:22:16] <Dorf> http://jsfiddle.net/r6FUj/8/ why isn't my if statement working?
[17:22:23] <nesoi> you're making things unnecessarily complicated
[17:23:06] <offlim> im telling you what i need, if you cant help me its ok
[17:23:15] <offlim> thanks for yourhelp though
[17:23:28] <motka> can anyone check this out :D http://nadrealno.net/hammer/
[17:23:30] <motka> I wrote it
[17:23:32] <EdenK> what the problem with add text or signs to input? just take the value and add what u want
[17:23:34] <nesoi> if you put a % in, you have to then deal with all the cases where someone types over it
[17:23:39] <nesoi> or to one side or the other side
[17:23:43] <nesoi> etc.
[17:23:49] <nesoi> just unnecessary work
[17:24:47] <motka> and feedback?
[17:24:49] <motka> any*
[17:25:28] <ignacio45> anybody knows if its possible to add another button next to the close button in que jquery dialog title bar?
[17:25:31] <nesoi> motka:  it's flashing
[17:26:01] <motka> yes :D
[17:26:13] <motka> and you can't touch it :D
[17:26:56] <nesoi> and clicking on the github link doesn't seem to work either
[17:27:16] <motka> yea :D
[17:27:23] <motka> .hammer() does the job well
[17:27:29] <motka> http://github.com/zlomerovic/hammer
[17:27:41] <DonkeyCongo> When I do .focus() on an input, it selects all the text. Any way to get around that?
[17:28:34] <haizum> i'm using .delegate and .undelegate to bind hover/click events to some elements, but when i re-delegate them, the function i specify is running for some reason (its a backbone function). also, every time it re-delegates, it will run 2x, 3x, 4x, etc. wtf??
[17:29:04] <motka> haizum - use my $.hammer() :D
[17:29:21] <haizum> motka, i don't get it
[17:29:23] <nesoi> motka:  how do you see it being used?
[17:29:36] <Dorf> anyone?
[17:29:54] <tw2113> anytwo?
[17:30:02] <motka> :D if you want to prevent something from going on, you'll use it :D
[17:30:47] <nesoi> you intend it to be dynamically applied and removed a lot?
[17:30:49] <haizum> motka, hmm well i only want to temporarily disable the events
[17:31:22] <motka> then you undelegate created events... use $.off :D
[17:32:12] <nesoi> for instance in JQM sometimes clicking something in a pop-up will trigger an event underneath what you click. So would you intend hammer to be used on the underlying div when the pop-up opens and then be removed when the pop-up closes?
[17:33:04] <haizum> motka, i'm using .undelegate which works ok, but whenever i re-delegate the events, it runs the function as though it were anonymous, without the event even being triggered for some reason. it's also bubbling up and running multiple times, one time more every time it's re-delegated
[17:34:08] <motka> re-delegating with what?
[17:34:45] <haizum> motka, .delegate :)
[17:35:08] <motka> then switch to .on
[17:35:21] <motka> even jQuery Official recommends it
[17:35:34] <motka> As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method. For earlier versions, however, it remains the most effective means to use event delegation. More information on event binding and delegation is in the .on() method. In general, these are the equivalent templates for the two methods:
[17:35:51] <Dorf> http://jsfiddle.net/r6FUj/8/ sorry for the second posting, but i'm going crazy trying to figure this out
[17:39:10] <haizum> motka, i just tried using .on instead and it's doing the very same thing
[17:39:31] <haizum> motka, the only reason i was using .delegate is because that's what backbone uses
[17:39:59] <motka> how are you using on? paste the selector line, and until (){
[17:40:02] <haizum> motka, it's running the function i specify with .on for some reason
[17:40:48] <EdenK> Drof, u using serialize() wrong see this http://jsfiddle.net/r6FUj/8/
[17:41:08] <haizum> $(view.el).on('click', '#' + headerType, view.products_toggle);
[17:41:28] <EdenK> sorry this http://jsfiddle.net/r6FUj/9/
[17:41:43] <haizum> motka, that's being set *after* another click event, so it shouldn't be firing unless i click again, but it is
[17:43:48] <Dorf> EdenK, what did you change?
[17:44:49] <EdenK> the serialize() should work on the form not the button and then it return u the values
[17:46:23] <Dorf> the values were coming back fine the way it was.  now i'm trying to get the no results returned message to appear if there were no results returned
[17:49:37] <Ukyo> can someone tell my why $(this).closest() is not working on the shown/hidden functions? http://jsfiddle.net/U5Uwm/
[17:53:19] <karma> hi guys, i'm quite new to query and programming: i have a table and i have to show only rows if one or more conditions (in a select drop down list) are verified. i'm stuck at the point where if the program checks the first one than, with the second test it ignores the result of the first one.. is there a place where i can paste my code?
[17:53:46] <karma> query = jquery
[17:59:14] <motka> is there a functoin $.closet() :P
[17:59:36] <tw2113> ?closest
[17:59:51] <tw2113>  http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:00:03] <motka> closet xD
[18:00:15] <tw2113> ah
[18:00:19] <tw2113> sue me, i've had a beer
[18:00:43] <motka> I will notÂ¨Â¨
[18:00:44] <motka> !
[18:01:27] <tw2113> thank you, all you'd get out of me is beer
[18:02:47] <Dorf> how do you set a no results found statement for jquery when ajax does not return any results from a php/mysql script?
[18:03:51] <tw2113> check if you have results, and if not, spit out a message saying "no results" ?
[18:04:02] <Dorf> i've tried and it isn't working
[18:04:52] <tw2113> which part? testing for returned data or the message?
[18:04:57] <Dorf> both
[18:05:30] <tw2113> start with the part that is required
[18:05:36] <tw2113> which is your returned data
[18:05:42] <tw2113> what are you expecting back, vs what are you getting back
[18:05:47] <Dorf> i get it back just fine
[18:06:07] <nesoi> so what are the performance improvements in JQM 1.4?
[18:06:08] <tw2113> then set up a test case where it fails
[18:06:13] <Dorf> but if nothing comes back, i want something saying that nothing was returned.
[18:06:15] <tw2113> and returns nothing
[18:06:20] <Dorf> i have.  nothing changes
[18:06:36] <tw2113> what are you having it return?
[18:06:40] <tw2113> json data?
[18:06:41] <Dorf> before it was saying undefined, but now there is no change in the results
[18:06:42] <Dorf> yes
[18:06:53] <tw2113> make your php return an empty array temporarily
[18:06:59] <tw2113> or boolean
[18:08:11] <Dorf> just did.  nothing came back
[18:08:37] <tw2113> then you have something you can check against
[18:08:45] <tw2113> i know a lot of people check the length property
[18:09:02] <Dorf> what length do i check?
[18:09:05] <tw2113> if ( data.length == 0 ) {
[18:09:22] <tw2113> then you can spit out an error message
[18:09:31] <Dorf> does that go in the $.each, before $.each or where?
[18:12:38] <Dorf> thank you for your help
[18:13:47] <tw2113> that goes wherever you're receiving your data back
[18:14:11] <tw2113> so probably right away inside your success callback
[18:14:38] <Dorf> yeah... something clicked in my brain and i figured where to put it.  i got it working now.  thank you.
[18:22:41] <haizum> does anyone know why when i re-bind events using .on (after disabling them with .off) they are bubbling up and the functions running multiple times, despite me putting ev.stopPropagation(); before the function call?
[18:28:01] <karma> Ukyo, use find() instead and remove the line on line 3 ( $(".nav-chevron").removeClass("icon-chevron-down").addClass("icon-chevron-up"); )

[18:53:42] <qkzoo1978> Could anyone point me in the direction why $("#appThisPage h3").html(... will work, but $("#notification").html won't, when the id of the h3 is "notification"?

[21:55:57] <johnb003> I do call this repeatedly but I do so on purpose every so often to get a new response from the server
[21:56:10] <johnb003> is it a cache option? I need to tell it to always ask the server or something?
