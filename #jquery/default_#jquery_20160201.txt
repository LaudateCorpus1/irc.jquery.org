[03:02:24] <teamcolt_> Hey guys, I am trying to capture a submitted post from a dynamic form... but I am trying to figure out the best way for jquery to "catch" the new form. Right now I am using $('body').on('submit', 'id^=book-', function() { } but that isn't working
[03:11:34] <teamcolt_> nvm got it <3
[04:07:03] <hellyeah> i have a spesific problem about jqxcalendar. How can i avoid date to be selected by default? http://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/36/
[04:08:56] <afidegnum> hello, pls i m not been able to dump my json data into the option list, can you please give a hint?    http://hastebin.com/imuhumikup.coffee
[04:19:08] <afidegnum> any insight?
[04:37:32] <ttrmw> I'm trying to use jqXHR.always() to handle some header that is set on both successful and failed requests from the API.. However, the args reflecting .done() and .fail() makes this feel really clunky (ie, having to use xhr for one and request for the other) - am I doing it wrong? Is there a better callback/approach for this?
[04:38:48] <ttrmw> Oh - I rtfm'd and I see it says to use done and fail explicitly. Is there a more DRY way since I'll be calling the same function with what amounts to the same arg by another name?
[04:43:04] <chesty> hey, I haven't fully grasped async calls yet. say I have $.getJSON( 'blah', function( data ) { for(var k in data) { $.getJSON how do I run a function when the last inner getJSON returns, but not all the other inner getJSONS?

[05:20:39] <aolko> uhh...
[05:44:01] <JZA> hi I need some help trying to write to a span.
[05:44:19] <JZA> I have a form with a select and a span to show the sum operation.
[05:44:46] <JZA> so I got a form with a select 1,2,3,4,5 form and an empty span
[05:45:21] <JZA> I got another span encapsulating the value amount and when the user select the number, it will show the result (value + select = span)
[05:47:49] <JZA> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8858181
[05:51:40] <arc_> JZA there is a syntax error on line 18
[05:51:45] <GeorgesLeYeti> Hi
[05:52:53] <arc_> JZA also i don't understand how you're trying to use keyup
[05:53:08] <JZA> arc_: yeah I miss a line
[05:53:21] <arc_> i assume you want to update this value when the user changes the dropdown selection
[05:53:22] <JZA> but what i dont get is the quantity on the <span id=amount">...
[05:53:27] <arc_> in that case, the event you want is called change
[05:53:35] <JZA> yoh
[05:53:36] <JZA> oh
[05:55:08] <arc_> also your math is not going to produce the correct value
[05:56:59] <JZA> yeah I am addin instead of multiplying
[05:57:09] <JZA> but atm I cant get the text to show on the span amount
[05:57:12] <spotted> Hello
[05:57:19] <GeorgesLeYeti> I want to make a simple thing when i click on button it select my input text
[05:57:19] <GeorgesLeYeti> https://jsfiddle.net/72Lrjq8n/
[05:57:20] <spotted> is anyone familiar with scriptloaders?
[05:57:24] <arc_> that's because the variable does not equal anything, because you are not properly assigning a value to it
[05:58:04] <arc_> the only thing you are writing to that span is the variable, which is nothing
[05:58:15] <arc_> if you replace it with a string it will work, which shows that line is not your problem
[05:58:19] <GeorgesLeYeti> where am i wrong ?
[05:59:00] <djam90> Hi.. when using AJAX with PHP Laravel framework.. when I return a JSON response with status code 500, the jQuery AJAX fail() method doesn't fire.
[05:59:07] <JZA> arc_: ok I replace the name but still no string in the span
[05:59:25] <djam90> What DOES cause the fail() method to fire on jQuery AJAX if not a 500 error code?
[05:59:46] <JZA> in theory that replacement would get 'a' value.
[05:59:56] <arc_> geez, there are lots of problems here : /
[06:00:13] <arc_> your first selector is trying to select an input, but you actually have a select element
[06:01:07] <JZA> arc_: yeah I understand that the select is broken but it should at least show me the value of the <p name="btc">..
[06:02:02] <arc_> no, because line 19 only fires when your event fires, which it never does, because it is not bound to anything, because the selector you are using to bind the event handler is selecting nothing
[06:02:20] <JZA> ok
[06:03:52] <arc_> all right then..
[06:06:48] <arc_> GeorgesLeYeti look in your console log
[06:10:19] <afidegnum> hello, any insight?
[06:10:46] <arc_> afidegnum you never asked a question
[06:10:48] <afidegnum> i m having difficulty loading the json dump into the option list
[06:10:50] <afidegnum> i did
[06:11:06] <arc_> 2 hours ago apparently
[06:11:23] <afidegnum> i asked 8 hours earier,
[06:12:09] <afidegnum> i m trying to load the json value into    http://hastebin.com/imuhumikup.coffee
[06:12:58] <arc_> okay, so what happens
[06:14:15] <afidegnum> the parent select menu displays but the child select menu doesn't
[06:14:36] <m2n> Hi there , I have a view : http://pastebin.com/KkSnmpsU , jquery : http://pastebin.com/EGqf1Xi3 , in this I have multiple update button and selectable options, I want to have the selected values and and process the request on update
[06:14:47] <m2n> can you tell me how can I achieve this ?
[06:14:58] <afidegnum> there is a json dump in a form of {     "5": "ACCRA",    "30": "DANGME EAST",     "37": "GA",   "75": "TEMA" }
[06:15:08] <afidegnum> from the remote host
[06:15:15] <arc_> where is your html
[06:15:21] <m2n> right now i am just including the same id for selectable options and update button which is obvi. wrong
[06:18:07] <afidegnum> arc_: here is the html form http://hastebin.com/futajadiqa.xml
[06:19:50] <arc_> okay. if you do console.log(option_list[i][0] + ' ' + option_list[i][1]); does it produce the values you expect
[06:20:44] <afidegnum> where should i place that?
[06:20:55] <arc_> in the for loop
[06:22:18] <arc_> also there is a syntax error on line 16
[06:22:42] <arc_> but that isn't causing your problem
[06:22:54] <afidegnum> there is no output in the console.log
[06:23:33] <arc_> you know you have to select something in #region_select to fire this event, right
[06:23:34] <afidegnum> i removed the hashtag earlier, and it didn't output anything i recently place it there,
[06:23:39] <afidegnum> yes,
[06:24:00] <arc_> look in your network tab and see if the ajax request is going through
[06:24:04] <GeorgesLeYeti> arc_, Ho thx :D
[06:24:18] <arc_> GeorgesLeYeti you're welcome
[06:24:40] <arc_> i believe if you sign up for jsfiddle you can set jquery to be enabled by default, but i haven't done it so i'm not 100% sure on that
[06:25:19] <afidegnum> there is GET add and GET /dist/6
[06:25:37] <afidegnum> all, status 200 OK
[06:25:37] <arc_> do they return code 200?
[06:26:22] <afidegnum> yes
[06:27:40] <afidegnum> but on the main console, i have 301 and 200
[06:27:49] <afidegnum> yet they output the json value
[06:27:53] <afidegnum> s
[06:28:05] <arc_> what is "they" in that sentence
[06:28:24] <afidegnum> there is,
[06:28:38] <afidegnum> sorry, english is not my language,
[06:28:40] <afidegnum> but trying
[06:28:50] <arc_> it's fine
[06:30:45] <afidegnum> arc_: any insight?
[06:31:51] <arc_> i still don't understand what you mean when you say "they output the json value"
[06:32:15] <arc_> how are you testing that
[06:32:59] <afidegnum> ok when i called a remote host where teh json value is to be dumped i did have a result, in a form of {"key": "value"} as posted earlier,
[06:33:09] <arc_> ok
[06:33:21] <afidegnum> but loading that data into the Option list is the problem
[06:33:34] <arc_> well since that console log didn't output anything, that makes me think you aren't getting into your for loop
[06:34:00] <arc_> so maybe the way you are building your array is the problem
[06:34:35] <arc_> can you verify that after line 14, the array actually contains the data
[06:34:48] <afidegnum> hmm, i m confused, i missed sleep 14 hours ago,
[06:34:53] <afidegnum> ok,
[06:35:56] <afidegnum> yes, i think this is where the problem is from, var option_list = [["", "--- Select District ---"]].concat(data);
[06:36:14] <afidegnum> the first string is loaded but the concatenated data is empty
[06:37:12] <arc_> can you do console.log(data); and see what it outputs
[06:38:37] <arc_> hi taplar
[06:38:46] <taplar_busy> morning
[06:38:55] <afidegnum> where do I see the console output?
[06:39:02] <afidegnum> i m using firebug
[06:39:06] <arc_> in the console tab
[06:39:27] <afidegnum> no output from data, except the json dump values,
[06:39:34] <arc_> so then the console.log in the for loop earlier might have actually been working?
[06:39:37] <arc_> you just didn't know where to see it?
[06:43:44] <Kartagis> okay, I'm writing this phonegap app and I'm using jquery. however, https://jsfiddle.net/zc9xno63/  doesn't work on mobile. any ideas why are welcome
[06:44:59] <arc_> i do not know the answer to your question, but what os/browser might be helpful information
[06:46:05] <arc_> suddenly i can't remember if phonegap is the thing that lets you write "native" applications with web technologies, if so disregard
[06:46:14] <afidegnum> arc, here is the header, the json dump of the console's screenshot      https://www.dropbox.com/s/fi627f48gbkrekf/Screenshot%20from%202016-02-01%2011%3A40%3A53.png?dl=0

[06:47:29] <Kartagis> arc_: yes it is, so I disregard
[06:47:49] <spotted> Hello, can anyone please tell me what is the new standard for script loading?
[06:47:55] <spotted> I just find outdated info.
[06:48:18] <spotted> LAB.js, yepnope, etc. are all deprecated or are not maintained anymore.
[06:48:35] <spotted> So what should I be using as a scriptloader in 2016?
[06:53:07] <arc_> afidegnum unfortunately i have to leave, but the only remaining step i can think of that you need to do is to verify that the array is being built properly before you get to the for loop
[06:54:03] <arc_> other than that everything seems fine to me
[06:54:56] <shoky> afidegnum:  your json is an object (with keys & values) but you're concating it to an array. doesn't make much sense
[06:55:07] <hellyeah> hey
[06:55:50] <hellyeah> anyone know about jqx calendar here? I have a spesific question date comes with current day to be selected how can i avoid this? http://jsfiddle.net/4q7qxwsg/39/
[06:56:48] <afidegnum> arc_: ok
[06:57:02] <afidegnum> shoky: thanks for the hint, how do I formulate it?
[06:57:53] <shoky> afidegnum if you want to turn that object into an array like you're using..   you'd need something like:  .concat( Object.keys(data).map(function(key) { return [key, data[key]] }) )
[06:59:08] <hellyeah> man that sucks
[07:00:14] <shoky> afidegnum: btw if you don't want to have that 301 then add a '/' to the end of your ajax url
[07:00:46] <afidegnum> ok
[07:02:45] <afidegnum> shoky: this the new code but it didn't help solve the issue, http://hastebin.com/aholawujoq.coffee
[07:08:12] <shoky> afidegnum:  what does the console.log(data)  show
[07:10:49] <shoky> afidegnum also what is that console.log(data) on line 12?  there's no `data` in scope there
[07:11:39] <afidegnum> posting the data into console log
[07:13:14] <afidegnum> shoky: still no apparent data inside the console log except the old one
[07:13:24] <taplar_busy> ln 17
[07:13:25] <shoky> afidegnum: i don't know which console log you're talking about
[07:13:30] <taplar_busy> your missing $ in front of your selector
[07:13:45] <shoky> heh that too
[07:14:00] <shoky> isn't that supposed to error :S
[07:14:03] <taplar_busy> yep
[07:14:17] <afidegnum> and i have error of duplicate jquery selector
[07:14:19] <taplar_busy> i copied it into fiddle and that's the error i got. fixed that and the select is populated
[07:14:39] <shoky> you only now mention you have errors? great
[07:16:07] <afidegnum> yes, that error was there but i tried to remove the selector and confused, i didn't know what i have done
[07:21:31] <afidegnum> i m still can't find my way out
[07:23:08] <shoky> afidegnum: did you fix line 17
[07:23:16] <shoky> afidegnum: and are you getting more errors in console
[07:23:28] <shoky> afidegnum: also try console.log(typeof data)  i guess
[07:24:17] <dimi1947> I have this HTML(https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/Ln23xysq/) and when clicking the book link I want to  access to the data-name attribute...i Tried it with the code in line 3(JS pane)..but with no result
[07:25:29] <taplar_busy> works for me
[07:25:36] <afidegnum> ah, it's working now, i had to deep refresh my page to get it working
[07:26:15] <afidegnum> here s the new code, http://hastebin.com/mosukepolu.coffee
[07:26:34] <shoky> great job
[07:27:23] <shoky> dimi1947 that's working for me too. but you should know that $('.profile>div') gets you ALL divs that are children of .profile
[07:27:54] <shoky> dimi1947: and doing .data('smth') on that gives you the data for only the first one, so happens to work in your case, but it's not a good way to do it
[07:28:03] <taplar_busy> afidegnum: you might consider changing your for loop to a map.  then you could set the result of the map in html().  would keep you from doing multiple appends, lookups, and the empty would be unnecessary
[07:28:28] <dimi1947> shoky...ok...how am I going to get the data-name attribute's value...how an i going to targe this?
[07:28:46] <shoky> dimi1947: and you'll probably want  $(this).closest('.profile').find('.name').data('name')
[07:28:59] <shoky> dimi1947: give that div a class like "name"
[07:29:06] <afidegnum> ok, i m not much familiar with map in jquery
[07:29:24] <dimi1947> shoky...so I must give it a class after all
[07:29:32] <taplar_busy> $.map(array, translationFunction)
[07:29:38] <shoky> dimi1947: that's exactly what classes are for :)
[07:29:55] <shoky> dimi1947: and it's not that you must, but you should :)
[07:30:07] <taplar_busy> afidegnum: https://jsfiddle.net/ugsoaw64/
[07:30:40] <afidegnum> ok
[07:34:52] <Kartagis> so, can anyone help?
[07:35:07] <Kartagis> okay, I'm writing this phonegap app and I'm using jquery. however, https://jsfiddle.net/zc9xno63/  doesn't work on mobile. any ideas why are welcome
[07:40:00] <taplar_busy> spit balling.  have you tried giving it the string '34' instead of the number?
[07:41:53] <dimi1947> can a div have 2 or more data attributes???
[07:42:01] <taplar_busy> yes
[07:54:57] <DirtyFinn> can a data attribute have more than one value? like class and id? data-something="something something_else"
[07:55:13] <taplar_busy> it's a string value
[07:55:21] <taplar_busy> unless you set it from jquery
[07:55:22] <DirtyFinn> okay
[08:08:05] <afidegnum> taplar_busy: chaining of the select element went bad, can you please have a look?
[08:08:07] <afidegnum> http://hastebin.com/legipiquze.coffee
[08:08:36] <afidegnum> instead of two, i have 4 option list, how do i chain the inheritance selection?
[08:09:36] <taplar_busy> which part?  i'm not following
[08:09:58] <afidegnum> from line 25
[08:10:23] <afidegnum> i want to replicate the same functionality to the child elements as well,
[08:11:08] <taplar_busy> the change logic you mean?
[08:11:19] <afidegnum> yes
[08:11:25] <taplar_busy> would it be the same url?
[08:12:17] <afidegnum> well i used a different url, i don't know if the same url will work, but to make things easier, i use different get url,
[08:12:29] <afidegnum> unless you say otherwise,
[08:13:04] <taplar_busy> not sure what your doing other than the code in your hastebin.  one sec
[08:13:55] <afidegnum> ok
[08:15:04] <shoky> afidegnum wrong selector on line 38? or 44
[08:15:44] <hellyeah> man that sucks
[08:15:51] <shoky> afidegnum btw  instead of $(this).find(':selected').val()  you can jsut use  this.value
[08:15:56] <afidegnum> should it be nested or in series?
[08:16:27] <shoky> you don't want to nest event handlers
[08:16:31] <shoky> usually
[08:18:13] * hellyeah that has to be design issue
[08:19:13] <djam90> Hi.. when using AJAX with PHP Laravel framework.. when I return a JSON response with status code 500, the jQuery AJAX fail() method doesn't fire.
[08:19:14] <djam90> What DOES cause the fail() method to fire on jQuery AJAX if not a 500 error code?
[08:19:49] <shoky> djam90: 500 should cause fail() to fire
[08:20:16] <shoky> if it's not, something else must be going on
[08:20:24] <afidegnum> shoky: it didn't work, http://hastebin.com/ilazufugen.coffee
[08:20:33] <afidegnum> taplar_busy: any hint?
[08:20:39] <shoky> afidegnum: you didn't even fix the selector
[08:20:50] <hellyeah> taplar is busy nowadays :XD
[08:20:51] <djam90> shoky when I return Response::json([data], 500), chrome dev tools show the response is error 500 code.. but fail definitely does not fire
[08:20:56] <shoky> afidegnum: and i said  `this.value` ,  not `$(this).this.value`
[08:21:24] <shoky> djam90: then like i said, something else must be going on
[08:21:42] <taplar_busy> afidegnum: you could extract a lot of that logic to a function  https://jsfiddle.net/L3g4ywvs/
[08:21:57] <shoky> djam90: if you have a live link i can take a look, or show your jquery code maybe someone will see something
[08:22:11] <djam90> shoky code coming right up:
[08:22:25] <shoky> afidegnum: and saying "it didnt work" is useless. that code obviously causes errors in your console. so you should mention them
[08:22:35] <djam90> Code: http://pastie.org/10704147
[08:22:44] <afidegnum> ok ok , sorry
[08:23:13] <shoky> djam90: you didnt add the event argument to the click handler
[08:24:45] <djam90> shoky I need it?
[08:25:08] <djam90> hmm ok I added it now
[08:25:14] <shoky> djam90: yes, if you want your code to be cross-browser
[08:25:19] <djam90> gotcha
[08:26:09] <shoky> djam90:  console.log(error);   what's error?
[08:26:52] <djam90> shoky I get this:
[08:28:00] <djam90> doh !!!!!!!!!!!!
[08:28:08] <djam90> error wasnt going to log anything was it
[08:28:20] <djam90> reading the docs: jqXHR.fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});
[08:28:31] <shoky> you didn't name any of the arguments error
[08:28:31] <djam90> so param 1 is jqXHR.. how do I get any data returned?
[08:28:32] <shoky> so no
[08:28:42] <shoky> jqXHR.responseText
[08:29:20] <djam90> and responseJSON
[08:29:20] <djam90> ahhhhhhhhhhh
[08:30:10] <djam90> shoky thanks!
[08:30:30] <shoky> responseJSON isn't standard i think
[08:30:41] <shoky> np
[08:30:56] <afidegnum> shoky: arc_, taplar_busy   it's working perfectly now, moving to chapter 2, I need to practice a lot on jquery,
[08:31:18] <shoky> ah jquery adds responseJSON
[08:31:19] <djam90> what do you mean isn't standard
[08:31:32] <djam90> ah so it could be just chrome
[08:31:34] <shoky> i mean it's not a standard property for xhr's
[08:31:44] <shoky> but jquery adds it in, it seems
[08:31:49] <djam90> shoky so I should parseJSON(responseText)
[08:31:55] <djam90> or just use responseJSON
[08:32:09] <shoky> djam90 either is fine i think if you're using jquery
[08:32:18] <djam90> sweet
[08:33:48] <shoky> djam90 but mm i'd go with JSON.parse(responseText)  to be safe, it's not clear if jquery will add responseJSON in all cases
[08:33:57] <shoky> from the docs, at least
[08:34:39] <shoky> tho why are you returning a 500 on purpose anyway?
[08:34:53] <shoky> and not just a 500, but a 500 with json body :S
[08:40:26] <Kartagis> taplar_busy: sorry, I didn't see your question to me. I now tried and no go
[08:57:07] <stiv2k_> hi
[08:57:30] <stiv2k_> $('.form-horizontal[role="form"]').submit();   <-- what is the .form-horizontal
[09:02:58] <djam90> shoky, I return 500 response if for some reason the database INSERT fails with an SQL PHP exception
[09:03:05] <djam90> and i want to display an error message should this happen
[09:03:12] <djam90> That is what 500 is for isn't it?
[09:03:57] <Kartagis> stiv2k_: it's a form element with that class name
[09:04:11] <Kartagis> or an element in general
[09:04:15] <stiv2k_> Kartagis: what does role= have to do with it
[09:05:02] <Kartagis> stiv2k_: it's an element that has the role form with that class name
[09:05:13] <Kartagis> (edited answer)
[09:05:26] <stiv2k_> i've never seen role before in html
[09:05:29] <stiv2k_> what is role?
[09:05:45] <Kartagis> probably data-role
[09:06:00] <stiv2k_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10403138/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-role-attribute-in-html
[09:07:15] <stiv2k_> ok
[09:07:18] <stiv2k_> next question
[09:07:56] <stiv2k_> that $('').submit() is accidentally calling both forms on the page because both of them are .form-horizontal[role="form"]
[09:08:05] <Kartagis> I'm writing this phonegap app and I'm using jquery. however, https://jsfiddle.net/zc9xno63/  doesn't work on mobile. any ideas why are welcome
[09:08:12] <Kartagis> so
[09:08:17] <Kartagis> narrow it
[09:08:38] <stiv2k_> can i make one form to be role=otherForm or something
[09:08:54] <Kartagis> if the code permits, aye
[09:10:13] <QssT> anyone know how I can take an ordinary select box and turn it into list so I can style it as I want?
[09:10:21] <QssT> http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/ ???
[09:10:33] <QssT> haven't been able to do it
[09:25:21] <QssT> I'm using this to replace the options tag with li
[09:25:28] <QssT> but how can I retain the values in the options?
[09:25:29] <QssT> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1801499/how-to-change-options-of-select-with-jquery
[09:27:36] <taplar_busy> your wanting to turn a <select> into a <ul> or <ol> ?
[09:28:24] <taplar_busy> if you want to be able to style it, jqueryui has a select widgit that takes a select and will transform it into something you can style
[09:29:07] <taplar_busy> http://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/
[09:57:41] <Nanor> I have a function that fires twice on a keypress event
[09:58:27] <Nanor> I've tried e.stopPropagation();
[10:37:08] <nru> hi is it possible to put this: <?php echo $_SESSION['ItemCountSession'] = $_SESSION['ItemCountSession'] + 1; ?>; in to a javascript variable ?
[10:42:20] <decx> yes
[10:44:00] <nru> it doesnt work
[10:44:01] <nru> this
[10:44:02] <nru> decx
[10:44:15] <nru> i got: var newItemNumber = <?php echo $_SESSION['ItemCountSession'] = $_SESSION['ItemCountSession'] + 1; ?>;
[10:44:53] <decx> it works
[10:44:57] <decx> you do stuff wrong
[10:56:07] <zagaza-> hi guys, anyone with experience in slick slider? If I have more than 1 vimeo videos embedded in my slick slider, it blends the sounds of all the videos together. I guess I am doing it wrong? Here is my code http://pastebin.com/npX9uavW would appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction
[11:20:25] <Dr-007> hey guys, i've got a question. here's my code: http://pastebin.com/jjUvppKq . i want to loop trough all the options of my select list. but instead of doing inserting the id in jQuery("#"+id+" option:selected") i want to use the var multiselect directly and then find('options').filter(':selected'); or something
[11:20:29] <Dr-007> how can i achieve this?
[11:24:30] <salacryl> Hi, I just downloaded jquery mobile and I love it. But: in a narvbar are the last tab displaced on all devices. What do I wrong here? PS: I copies the HTMl from the examples
[12:14:43] <relipse2> i'm using $('body').animate({scrollTop: scrollY}, 500, 'swing'...) to "scroll the page down", but how do I get the correct scrollY location of a div and ensure that i scroll so that the top of the div is at the top of the browser (if can)
[12:15:08] <robertmaxrees> you want .offset();
[12:15:25] <relipse2> so like $('#mydiv').offset().top ?
[12:15:31] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:46:29] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[13:21:31] <Dr-007> ner
[14:32:31] <Scriptonaut> I'm having the success callback on the ajax method being called, when I specifically render a 422 error. Why would this happen?
[14:32:50] <Scriptonaut> When I look at the arguments that success gets, the status says 200
[14:33:15] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're properly returning a 422?  have you look at your networking tab to see what the browser is getting?
[14:33:26] <Scriptonaut> I"ll do that really quck
[14:33:27] <Scriptonaut> quick*
[14:33:48] <Scriptonaut> says I'm getting a 20 OK
[14:33:50] <Scriptonaut> 200 OK*
[14:33:56] <robertmaxrees> then your issue is server-side :)
[14:34:02] <Scriptonaut> ah, ok
[14:38:17] <Sagar> how can we make a regex so that the input value should always have a particular prefix
[14:38:28] <robertmaxrees> no need for regex for that.
[14:38:42] <Sagar> assume we want user to input a, a valid ID should be #someIDwithNumbers1235
[14:38:44] <robertmaxrees> can use .indexOf() instead.
[14:39:14] <Sagar> indexOf, isn't it used for URLs?
[14:39:23] * dddh is back
[14:39:24] <robertmaxrees> it's for all strings.
[14:39:32] <Sagar> how should it work then?
[14:39:44] <robertmaxrees> someString.indexOf('#a') === 0;
[14:39:57] <Sagar> this is what i have /^[#a-zA-Z0-9-]$/
[14:40:14] <Sagar> i am trying, the input should always begin with # if no #, it should so error
[14:40:22] <Sagar> it should only allow alphabets, digits and -
[14:40:24] <dddh> what about return false vs event.preventDefault() and stopPropagation?
[14:40:26] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want to make sure it starts with #?  then just .indexOf('#');
[14:40:31] <robertmaxrees> dddh what about them?
[14:40:57] <dddh> robertmaxrees: is return false lame and preventDefault be used?
[14:41:13] <dddh> it depends?
[14:41:34] <robertmaxrees> return false does more than just preventDefault();
[14:41:38] <robertmaxrees> i always explicitly call the methods I want.
[14:41:57] <robertmaxrees> return false calls event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault()
[14:42:15] <dddh> that is what I prefer too
[14:42:18] <daniman> any resource you recommend me on learning jquery?
[14:42:23] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[14:42:58] <robertmaxrees> daniman ^
[14:44:09] <dddh> I see a lot of <a href="#" onclick="return null;"> in designers works and argue that js should be in separate file $(document).ready(..) and so on
[14:44:20] <robertmaxrees> dddh it absolutely should.
[14:44:26] <Velveeta> +1
[14:44:28] <robertmaxrees> onclick is not a good thing.
[14:44:35] <robertmaxrees> though you don't have to stick everything ina  document ready.
[14:46:26] <Velveeta> that was one of my gripes about angular early on.. we'd previously decided onclick was a bad thing, and then ngclick comes along and everybody's all in on it
[14:46:33] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:46:34] <dddh> I like when elements have different ids and all html/css/js code is in separate files :(
[14:46:45] <robertmaxrees> dddh don't be using IDs just because.
[14:46:54] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, things should beseparated.
[14:47:33] <dddh> very often it is enough to have some class or something else
[14:47:39] <robertmaxrees> right.'
[14:49:45] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta we had a designer once try to slip in his own event binding framework to our codebase.  it relied on data attributes that referenced functions in his js.
[14:50:01] <Velveeta> <head explodes>
[14:50:11] <Velveeta> so (s)he reinvented onclick :D
[14:50:21] <robertmaxrees> i tried to explain that a) we already had backbone available, just use a view, and b) it was onclick revisited.
[14:50:24] <robertmaxrees> they didn't see the big problem.
[14:50:32] <robertmaxrees> it was one of the more mind bendy things i've experience.
[14:50:37] <robertmaxrees> *experienced
[14:50:47] <Velveeta> at least with react on* event handlers, they roll up to the root context as a delegated listener, that allows for component-level bindings with the performance of a delegated listener
[14:51:05] <Velveeta> er root component
[14:51:21] <robertmaxrees> that sounds about right.
[15:16:31] <ABM_Dan> jquery doesn't have a debounce equivalent in the core, does it?
[15:18:50] <ABM_Dan> robertmaxrees: I had to redo a site that originally used form wrapping the whole body, all links triggered a function setting the form action and submitting the form. All of this so he could pass session values in hidden fields instead of querystring or cookies.
[15:19:31] <robertmaxrees> i've seen that before.
[15:19:38] <robertmaxrees> ASP does something similar.
[15:20:05] <ABM_Dan> wow.
[15:20:22] <robertmaxrees> rather, the old webforms setup did.
[15:20:33] <robertmaxrees> modern doesn't any more because it's a terrible idea.
[15:20:42] <ABM_Dan> Btw, it wasn't like a post-processor that took the normal html and formified it. No, the view layer was hardcoded like that.
[15:20:47] <ABM_Dan> (it was php)
[15:20:51] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't surprised me.
[15:20:54] <robertmaxrees> *surprise.
[15:20:59] <robertmaxrees> i've seen lots of weird stuff like that.
[15:21:32] <ABM_Dan> that said I do use data-x to describe form properties and then hook triggers on those.
[15:21:45] <robertmaxrees> how are you hooking those triggers?
[15:22:22] <ABM_Dan> $('[data-confirm]').click(...);
[15:22:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:22:29] <ABM_Dan> Stuff like that.
[15:22:35] <robertmaxrees> don't use data attributes for selecting.
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use them for event handlers, use delegated listeners.  even then I'd avoid it since you can create listeners use .data() which can't be selected on.
[15:23:13] <ABM_Dan> please refrain from blanket statements
[15:23:34] <robertmaxrees> it's a pretty sound blanket statement to make.
[15:23:44] <robertmaxrees> selecting on data attributes is something you should avoid.
[15:23:46] <ABM_Dan> caveats always apply
[15:23:49] <robertmaxrees> rarely.
[15:23:58] <robertmaxrees> and in this case, you're munging what data attributes are for.
[15:24:11] <ABM_Dan> I don't usually use .data when manipulating data-x
[15:24:17] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[15:24:46] <ABM_Dan> so I should do the thing that breaks the thing so it becomes a thing that is not reliable because I am making it so?
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:24:58] <robertmaxrees> you should use tools in the way they're designed to be used.
[15:25:10] <robertmaxrees> .data() is much faster, as well as safer in old browsers.
[15:25:19] <robertmaxrees> data attributes also aren't really designed to be used in selectors.
[15:26:26] <ABM_Dan> premise: some of the stuff in the project was already doing it.
[15:26:32] <ABM_Dan> I just made things consistent.
[15:27:00] <robertmaxrees> at my place we tend to break convention in cases like that just so we don't make our lives harder down the road.
[15:27:01] <ABM_Dan> With that said, I don't understand the specific issue, should I just overload the class attribute?
[15:27:20] <robertmaxrees> usually we spin up a ticket to handle those cases if we can't take care of it right away.
[15:27:33] <robertmaxrees> and you can still use data attributes, you just don't directly bind using them.
[15:27:36] <Emn1ty> why do .sortable and .draggable do the over event differently?
[15:27:41] <ABM_Dan> I'm not saying it was the right thing to do, but that's how I got there.
[15:27:58] <Emn1ty> .draggable's event.target is the element being dragged over, while .sortable is entire list
[15:28:15] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan i was purely arguing about "The right way".  i wasn't making any sort of appraisal of your codebase ;)
[15:28:42] <robertmaxrees> Emn1ty iirc sortable applies to the entire list.
[15:28:46] <ABM_Dan> But I promise I am interested, I push back because I want solid reasons, not because I don't want reasons.
[15:28:50] <robertmaxrees> draggable would be a specific element.
[15:29:06] <Emn1ty> yes, but this makes it very difficult to impliment custom hover areas
[15:29:07] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan there's a way to have a good discussion then.  there's no need to come off as argumentative :)
[15:29:21] <robertmaxrees> Emn1ty are you stuck?  maybe you'd like some help?
[15:29:40] <ABM_Dan> Can't help it, it's in the genes.
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan :) just giving you some feedback.  it's helpful in here if you ask questions instead of telling people how to conduct themselves.
[15:30:46] <Emn1ty> robertmaxrees: basically I'm trying to have the same behavior on both the draggable and sortable bindings in our app
[15:30:57] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can use a delegated listener and check your data attribute within the handler and go crazy from there.
[15:31:03] <Emn1ty> but since this piece of it is so different, it requires that I write them differently
[15:31:34] <ABM_Dan> I just don't like the "don't do x approach". It's the less honest version of "doing x has y issues, try z instead"
[15:31:42] <Emn1ty> just seems odd that they'd not behave the same, since sortable already sets the 'this' context to the entire list
[15:31:47] <robertmaxrees> Emn1ty ah.  i've have to play with it, but there's a way to work with that.
[15:31:56] <robertmaxrees> i just can't remember iut.
[15:31:56] <Emn1ty> yeah
[15:32:09] <Emn1ty> at the moment the options are to just use draggable for the sorting
[15:32:12] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan i'd disagree with that sentiment, but i see why you'd feel that way.
[15:32:26] <Emn1ty> or use event.originalTarget.closest(...)
[15:32:52] <Emn1ty> or something similar to "figure out" where I'm hovering
[15:33:07] <Emn1ty> we will likely do the former, though
[15:33:12] <Emn1ty> just switch to draggable for sorting
[15:33:17] <robertmaxrees> Emn1ty are you sure you don't want to just use a mouseenter listener?
[15:34:00] <Emn1ty> I could try that, but it still seems a bit hacky
[15:34:01] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan also, i did give you the alternative approach to use :)
[15:34:21] <robertmaxrees> Emn1ty nah, you want to concern yourself with hovers, not with dragging/sorting.
[15:34:37] <ABM_Dan> robertmaxrees: it got lost to be honest tho. You might have referenced terms I am not used to, I'm not primarily a frontend dev.
[15:34:47] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan event delegation.
[15:34:56] <ABM_Dan> oh yeah, I do that a LOT
[15:35:05] <ABM_Dan> you mean .on('click' right?
[15:35:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:35:15] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event'
[15:35:17] <robertmaxrees> err, 1 serc.
[15:35:19] <ABM_Dan> yeah yeah
[15:35:26] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[15:35:32] <robertmaxrees> the second arg there is the important one.
[15:35:50] <ABM_Dan> I shortcutted with $('[data...
[15:36:00] <robertmaxrees> that doesn a very different thing.
[15:36:38] <ABM_Dan> but it happens almost always as $parentSelector.on('[data-...]', 'click', func...);
[15:37:02] <ABM_Dan> I'll make it a point to go from often to almost always.
[15:37:02] <robertmaxrees> errr, you'd swap those first two args, and that's not what i'm suggesting.
[15:37:17] <ABM_Dan> you're right.
[15:37:27] <ABM_Dan> what are you suggesting then?
[15:37:27] <robertmaxrees> are all of these elements <a> or something else?
[15:37:43] <robertmaxrees> because you should really read the data attribute within the handler using .data()
[15:37:51] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, use classes and do your bindings on those.
[15:37:54] <ABM_Dan> They can be whatever, links, buttons (I tend to prefer buttons when they have a js event), checkboxes...
[15:38:12] <robertmaxrees> since they're discrete handlers, they should probably have separate classes anyway.
[15:39:12] <robertmaxrees> plus you'd use different events to handle checkboxes than you would with links and things.
[15:39:56] <ABM_Dan> if they have the same data-x structure, they need the same behavior, but that never happens on radically incompatible situation.
[15:40:00] <ABM_Dan> *s
[15:40:14] <ABM_Dan> Anyway, I'll keep that in mind.
[15:40:17] <robertmaxrees> behavior != event binding :)
[15:46:45] <ABM_Dan> I try to use attributes as descriptive as I can, if I change the underlying behavior the attributes should be able to stay the same.
[15:47:06] <ABM_Dan> *underlying implementation/event triggers
[15:47:28] <robertmaxrees> sure.  but you should also be careful not to define behavior using markup.
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> classes should describe the document, not specify which handlers a thing should "get"
[15:48:28] <ABM_Dan> Aren't things already happening on that layer? I mean stuff like required, pattern, etc.
[15:48:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:48:58] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be dictating behavior in your markup.
[15:49:11] <meLon> Can someone explain:   return foo && bar;  Trying to google, but not sure what to google here ;_;
[15:49:12] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're referencing.
[15:49:26] <ABM_Dan> <input required> dictates behavior, doesn't it?
[15:49:27] <robertmaxrees> meLon that sees if both are truthy.
[15:49:42] <robertmaxrees> ABM_Dan that's presentational information, and that's not telling the JS what to do.
[15:49:44] <meLon> So, it's just like if(foo && bar), robertmaxrees ?
[15:49:56] <robertmaxrees> meLon sort of, yeah.
[15:49:58] <ABM_Dan> meLon: it's going to return a boolean, if both foo and bar are true is true, otherwise false.
[15:50:10] <robertmaxrees> *if both foo and bar are truthy.
[15:50:13] <robertmaxrees> not just true.
[15:50:27] <meLon> Thanks, that's what I was expecting, but it seems to be passing true.  Will troubleshoot.  Thanks robertmaxrees ABM_Dan
[15:50:32] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[15:51:55] <ABM_Dan> almost relevant question, if I go .data('nonexistingvalue') do I always get undefined? (assuming nonexistingvalue is not defined)
[15:52:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3o3nrtre/
[15:52:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:53:10] <ABM_Dan> I did test myself, I was more worried about cross-compatibility :P
[15:53:20] <robertmaxrees> jquery handles that part for you.
[15:53:30] <robertmaxrees> unless the library has a bug, that's what you'll get.
[15:54:12] <robertmaxrees> that's partially why you use jquery fwiw.
[15:54:15] <ABM_Dan> if that's the contract I'm ok.
[15:54:44] <robertmaxrees> normalize those little oddities, take care of backwards compatibility, AND simplify the DOM api.
[16:02:45] <ABM_Dan> Indeed. I just get paranoid if it's not explicitly stated in the documentation.
[16:03:37] <robertmaxrees> heh, it's a core feature of the library.  no need to be paranoid :)
[17:24:00] <labsy> hi all
[17:24:06] <labsy> I could need some help with knockoutjs
[17:24:11] <labsy> anybody experienced with it?
[17:25:19] <labsy> I want to do bindings on a nested object. http://paste.scsys.co.uk/504948?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[17:25:43] <labsy> the pastebin shows my html (with knockoutjs bindings) and my json I'm working with.
[17:25:50] <labsy> I try to do bindings on a nested object. but I can not reach the value in the most inner objects.
[17:25:51] <snover> labsy: this is the channel for jquery.
[17:25:53] <labsy> the values.
[17:26:02] <labsy> snover: yeah I know. but I use jquery also.
[17:26:19] <labsy> I think it is more a question of "how do I iterate over nested objects in javascript"
[17:33:35] <labsy> ok got it already.
[17:33:38] <labsy> thanks anyway.
[18:42:17] <cloak7> hi folks. i have an startpage with an responsive behavior. there are images with text that show up on hover. when i check this startpage on my tablet it wont show the hover text and emediatly open the link. and thats what i want to change. the page: http://tinyurl.com/jxlrz8o - and here is an example i found in the net http://nemotheme.dreamhosters.com what would you guys say. do i need jquery or is css enough?
[18:43:56] <robertmaxrees> you want the same behavior on click AND on hover?
[18:47:37] <cloak7> robertmaxrees: yes, like when i navigate on my tablet ... first click to oben the overlay and second to open the link
[18:47:49] <cloak7> open*
[18:47:53] <robertmaxrees> then you need to change your JS to handle touch events the way you want.
[18:48:03] <cloak7> like here... http://nemotheme.dreamhosters.com
[18:48:18] <robertmaxrees> that would be handled by JS.
[18:48:22] <cloak7> k
[18:48:37] <cloak7> my site use jquery
[18:48:43] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:49:12] <cloak7> so i should use it on that case as well
[18:49:16] <cloak7> or native js?
[18:49:28] <robertmaxrees> you can use jquery to help.
[18:49:57] <cloak7> can u show me an example on jsfiddle to handle those events
[18:50:06] <robertmaxrees> by using .on()
[18:50:10] <cloak7> k
[18:50:11] <robertmaxrees> and looking at touch events.
[18:55:35] <huck5> <div class="ui-grid-d">
[18:55:35] <huck5> 	<div class="ui-block-a">
[18:55:36] <huck5> 	</div>
[18:55:36] <huck5> 	<div class="ui-block-b">
[18:55:36] <huck5> 	</div>
[18:55:36] <huck5> 	<div class="ui-block-c">
[18:55:37] <huck5> 	</div>
[18:55:37] <huck5> 	<div class="ui-block-d">
[18:55:38] <huck5> 	</div>
[18:55:40] <huck5> I'm so sorry.
[18:55:42] <cloak7> robertmaxrees: what do you think. do i get problems with that existing $jQuery... is there a way to check if there are always event handlers used on that div's`?
[18:56:10] <cloak7> already*
[18:56:55] <cannap> abcd
[18:57:00] <huck5> jQuery mobile - If I want elements aligned on right side of page, is it better to use "ui-grid-d", with empty "ui-block"s until I reach the "ui-block-e" I want the elements in? Or just use a "ui-grid-a" with css to align on right hand side?
[18:57:20] <huck5> And again, i apologize for that obnoxious paste :/
[18:57:38] <robertmaxrees> cloak7 i'm going to be 100% honest and say that i didn't look at your site, nor am I going to :)
[18:57:50] <robertmaxrees> not really interested in sifting around in your code.
[18:57:58] <Joel> https://gist.github.com/jjshoe/636948ae6e68daff9f9f - thoughts on what I'm screwing up here?
[18:59:04] <robertmaxrees> Joel you're losing your "this" reference inside that function.
[18:59:14] <robertmaxrees> why not just call the handler you want, instead?
[19:00:02] <Joel> robertmaxrees, how would I fix losing "this" ?
[19:00:21] <robertmaxrees> Joel i wouldn't - i'd just call the event handler you want to call directly.
[19:00:32] <Joel> Robdgreat, I didn't ask how you would ;)
[19:00:43] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[19:00:44] <robertmaxrees> really?
[19:00:52] <robertmaxrees> okay - check out MDN's docs on .bind()
[19:01:00] <Joel> bind, perfect, thanks.
[19:01:14] <robertmaxrees> fwiw proxying logic through the document is a terrible idea fwiw.
[19:10:38] <Joel> In this case it's a chrome extension trying to interact with some terribly minified js
[19:10:58] <robertmaxrees> alright then.  nbd.
[19:11:11] <robertmaxrees> see what your issue was now?
[19:11:19] <Joel> yup, thanks for the tip on bind
[19:11:28] <robertmaxrees> sure'
[19:11:34] <Joel> I wish I could call into their page more readily, or better yet, they had an api of sorts :\
[19:15:19] <robertmaxrees> what page is this?
[19:15:43] <Joel> okcupid.com
[19:15:59] <robertmaxrees> don't they have an API?
[19:16:01] <Joel> tried to run their JS through several tidy things, complains about compliation errors
[19:16:19] <Joel> not publicly
[19:16:27] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[19:21:55] <Robdgreat> Joel: eh
[19:22:31] <Joel> Robdgreat, ?
[19:23:18] <Robdgreat> all I saw was 18:00 [ Joel] Robdgreat, I didn't ask how you would ;)
[19:23:21] <Robdgreat> in my away log
[19:23:56] * Robdgreat sends robertmaxrees a c&d
[19:24:15] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[19:25:26] <Robdgreat> I'm about to solve this, though. See y'all around
[19:43:06] <simme> hey, can someone help me with that: http://pastebin.com/1YpB6XHr why does dfd.done(…) fire , although dfd's state is pending? ($.Deferred();)
[19:43:53] <robertmaxrees> the callbacvk doesn't fire.
[19:44:07] <robertmaxrees> dfd.done(console.log("foo")); runs the console.log and assigns the return to the done.
[19:44:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass a function reference there instead.
[19:44:48] <simme> thanks robertmaxrees!
[19:53:12] <simme> robertmaxrees: if i use this within a loop, how would i make sure it uses the right arguments for the callback call and not only the ones from the last iteration?
[19:54:52] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[19:55:26] <simme> sec
[19:58:10] <simme> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/T6zh3QrM
[19:58:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:59:12] <robertmaxrees> what is "fooList" supposed to be?
[19:59:42] <simme> it’s an array
[19:59:49] <robertmaxrees> make a functioning jsfiddle.
[20:00:08] <robertmaxrees> because it looks like you want to attach a series of callbacks to a deferred.
[20:00:46] <robertmaxrees> also, what is baz?  need some more info here :)
[20:04:28] <simme> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jrvdsk5p/
[20:05:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're confused about scope and loops and functions.
[20:06:21] <robertmaxrees> for loops are bad.
[20:06:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/f46wjx54/ do something like this instead.
[21:50:36] <Audlex> has anyone combatted the hiding menu on mobile chrome? i have this full page scrolling site and when it vanishing on scroll down it messes with my measurements
[23:26:31] <yogesh> Hi
[23:26:44] <yogesh> I have one query
[23:27:08] <yogesh> related to jquery dialog
[23:28:40] <yogesh> When accessing my website on an iPad, the dialogs function fine in both orientations. But if the dialog is open and I rotate the iPad in landscape mode, the dialogs lose their positions.
[23:28:53] <yogesh> is there any solution ?
[23:30:40] <yogesh> I am using jquery dialog
[23:34:42] <yogesh> I tried with setting the position of dialog using media query like this eg. @media screen and (max-width : 736px) and (orientation:landscape) { 		.ui-dialog { 			top: -852px !important; 			margin: 0 auto !important; 		} 	} but it has problem
[23:34:53] <yogesh> can any one suggest me the better solution
