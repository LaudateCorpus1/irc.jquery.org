[00:00:51] <fattest> brunoais: thanks!
[00:00:52] <brunoais> fattest, doesn't it already do it?
[00:01:03] <brunoais> in which browser are you testing it?
[00:01:17] <fattest> firefox
[00:01:26] <fattest> if you click on the play button, it doesn't change the text
[00:01:35] <fattest> it changes only if you click on the <li>
[00:01:52] <brunoais> fattest, ah!
[00:02:34] <fattest> indeed!
[00:07:55] <brunoais> fattest, I was trying to get a fancy way but it seems like there isn't
[00:08:02] <brunoais> you need to go by brute force
[00:08:10] <fattest> brunoais: how can i do this?
[00:08:28] <fattest> its for a simple site so i think brute force might do the trick
[00:08:44] <brunoais> fattest, well. You know the url to the song that is playing, right?
[00:08:55] <fattest> right
[00:09:11] <brunoais> fattest, there's an event that is fired when the media starts to play
[00:09:23] <fattest> ok
[00:09:23] <brunoais> fattest, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Media_events
[00:09:39] <brunoais> When that even thappens
[00:10:07] <brunoais> you locate the <a> (in the appropriate sub-DOM) where the url matches
[00:10:24] <brunoais> fattest, can you get the rest?
[00:10:50] <fattest> which event triggers when the music starts to play?
[00:13:45] <fattest> i dont think i have any idea on how to do this
[00:13:52] <brunoais> fattest, I'm not telling you that... but I can help
[00:14:00] <fattest> ok
[00:14:02] <brunoais> what is the act that you are looking for?
[00:14:12] <brunoais> i.e. action
[00:14:52] <fattest> play
[00:15:07] <brunoais> fattest, read the description
[00:15:10] <brunoais> does it fit?
[00:16:34] <brunoais> fattest?
[00:16:45] <fattest> oh no
[00:16:48] <fattest> sorry i was reading
[00:17:13] <fattest> brunoais: its playing
[00:17:18] <fattest> "playing"
[00:17:29] <fattest> when media begins to play for the first time
[00:17:46] <brunoais> fattest, \o/
[00:17:56] <brunoais> ok, that's the deal
[00:18:00] <brunoais> what's next
[00:18:09] <fattest> create an action listener for that event?
[00:18:21] <brunoais> fattest, what's an action listener?
[00:18:35] <fattest> brunoais: an event that triggers
[00:18:45] <brunoais> eventListener?
[00:18:51] <fattest> yes
[00:19:34] <brunoais> yes, that's the next thing
[00:20:46] <fattest> ok
[00:20:52] <fattest> so how can i go about doing this?
[00:21:27] <brunoais> let just check the docs so that I get the right names
[00:21:35] <fattest> ok
[00:23:54] <brunoais> fattest, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement
[00:23:58] <brunoais> media element reference
[00:24:08] <brunoais> <audio> and <video> extends Media
[00:24:22] <brunoais> see if you find there how to get the source
[00:24:37] <fattest> ok
[00:25:14] <fattest> brunoais: buffered ?
[00:25:41] <brunoais> that's boolean...
[00:25:47] <brunoais> I don't think you can do much from there
[00:26:01] <brunoais> besides, if "playing" is fired, it was already buffered
[00:26:38] <fattest> brunoais: "currentSrc" ?
[00:26:48] <fattest> gives the media URL
[00:26:58] <brunoais> fattest, looks good, no :D?
[00:27:04] <fattest> indeed!
[00:27:12] <brunoais> now, is your source code...
[00:27:17] <fattest> ok
[00:27:19] <brunoais> where can you match that value with?
[00:28:40] <fattest> brunoais: what do you mean matching value?
[00:29:50] <brunoais> fattest, Hum... then, for starters, try to get that value and alert it
[00:29:57] <brunoais> that should help you understand what I mean
[00:29:59] <fattest> oh
[00:33:21] <fattest> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/vkMqR/947/ ?
[00:36:07] <brunoais> fattest, why is it on the top of the js?
[00:37:19] <fattest> sorry
[00:37:23] <fattest> moving it down now
[00:37:30] <brunoais> fattest, don't say sorry ;)
[00:37:34] <brunoais> just think
[00:37:39] <brunoais> you are here to learn
[00:37:45] <fattest> ok
[00:37:46] <brunoais> not to feel sorry for mistakes :D
[00:38:02] <fattest> ok
[00:38:17] <fattest> i moved it down and i get the same result http://jsfiddle.net/vkMqR/949/
[00:38:52] <brunoais> fattest, you talked about "currentSrc", right?
[00:39:46] <brunoais> fattest, better: please describe to me what does that function do
[00:39:47] <fattest> yes
[00:39:54] <fattest> ok
[00:40:24] <fattest> current src is the the absolute URL of the chosen media resource
[00:41:06] <brunoais> fattest, where do you see that O_O?
[00:41:10] <brunoais> I see this:
[00:41:49] <brunoais> if the attribute "animationName" of the event has the value of "currentSrc", alert: "1"
[00:42:07] <brunoais> fattest, which one is the nearest?
[00:43:44] <fattest> ohh
[00:44:50] <fattest> i saw that in the developer mozilla guide
[00:45:28] <brunoais> fattest, you saw what?
[00:45:54] <fattest> never mind
[00:46:08] <fattest> i am working on it
[00:50:23] <fattest> brunoais: im stuck!
[00:50:36] <brunoais> fattest, did you try doing what I asked?
[00:51:28] <fattest> what did you ask
[00:51:34] <fattest> "which one is the nearest?"
[00:53:17] <brunoais> "fattest, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement" -> "see if you find there how to get the source" -> The attribute "currentSrc" givse the source -> "<brunoais> fattest, Hum... then, for starters, try to get that value and alert it"
[00:53:33] <brunoais> fattest, beofre that
[00:53:41] <brunoais> try to get the value and alert it
[00:53:44] <fattest> ok
[00:58:26] <fattest> brunoais: is this correct? document.addEventListener("playing", function (event) { ?
[00:58:35] <brunoais> fattest, no
[00:58:48] <brunoais> you are listening to the wrong element
[01:00:27] <fattest> brunoais: how about, "audio.addevent...."
[01:01:21] <brunoais> the audio variable does not contain a DOM node
[01:01:29] <brunoais> read the code
[01:05:42] <fattest> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/vkMqR/950/ how about this?
[01:07:09] <dopie> $(function() {
[01:07:09] <dopie>         $('#user_dob_month').regexMask(/^\d+$/);
[01:07:09] <dopie>         }
[01:07:10] <dopie>       );
[01:07:12] <dopie> is that right
[01:07:15] <dopie> ?
[01:07:34] <brunoais> fattest, it is supposed to alert the url of the current playing song. not just "@"
[01:07:59] <brunoais> dopie, I don't think that jQuery has that method
[01:08:37] <dopie> bruno.... basically what i want to do is have #user_dob_month not be allowed to enter letters
[01:08:39] <dopie> i just want numbers
[01:09:11] <brunoais> dopie, jsfiddle it pls. I'll give you tips on hwo to get that
[01:10:22] <fattest> brunoais: if we know that the play button has been triggered, why do we need to know the url of the song?
[01:10:50] <brunoais> fattest, because you need a way to know the name of the song that is being played
[01:10:59] <fattest> oh ok
[01:11:11] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/8NzQE/
[01:12:25] <brunoais> dopie, where's the <form> tag?
[01:13:01] <fattest> brunoais: im stuck!
[01:13:12] <brunoais> fattest, what do you have now?
[01:13:13] <dopie> brunoais, oh i just di that that part hold on
[01:15:38] <fattest> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/vkMqR/951/
[01:16:41] <brunoais> fattest, nice, nice
[01:16:45] <fattest> thanks!
[01:16:52] <brunoais> now, what happens when you try to play the video?
[01:17:47] <fattest> the text of hi changes
[01:17:57] <fattest> and the exact location changes
[01:18:00] <brunoais> fattest, before that
[01:18:13] <brunoais> it does 2 things
[01:19:34] <fattest> it alerts the location
[01:19:42] <brunoais> fattest, an url, right?
[01:19:52] <fattest> indeed!
[01:20:01] <brunoais> fattest, does it feel familiar?
[01:20:09] <fattest> yes
[01:20:22] <brunoais> fattest, where did you find something like that?
[01:20:50] <fattest> <source type="audio/mp3" src="http://www.archive.org/download/bolero_69/Bolero.mp3">
[01:21:00] <brunoais> fattest, what else?
[01:21:12] <fattest> <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/bolero_69/Bolero.mp3">
[01:21:23] <brunoais> fattest, what's the text content of it?
[01:21:37] <fattest> Ravel Bolero
[01:21:44] <brunoais> is that the name of the song?
[01:22:02] <fattest> indeed!
[01:22:42] <brunoais> fattest, can you do the rest, now you know the objective and the path to the objective?
[01:23:26] <brunoais> fattest, here: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors
[01:23:30] <brunoais> that helps, if you need
[01:24:39] <fattest> thank you
[01:25:08] <brunoais> fattest, btw, next time, when you get some code somewhere, try to understand it. Never use it as a black box
[01:25:22] <brunoais> dopie, call me when done :)
[01:25:34] <dopie> brunoais, will do :)
[01:25:44] <dopie> do you need the whole form?
[01:25:46] <dopie> its quite big
[01:25:46] <dopie> :)
[01:26:03] <dopie> not really sure why you need the whole form anyways
[01:26:16] <brunoais> dopie, just give me the <form> with that part that interests
[01:26:32] <brunoais> no need for all contents insside the <form>, then
[01:26:36] <brunoais> but I need the <form>
[01:26:40] <dopie> k
[01:27:49] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/8NzQE/1/
[01:27:49] <fattest> brunoais: i'm having difficulties alerting the name instead of currentSrc
[01:28:02] <brunoais> fattest, what do you have now?
[01:28:24] <fattest> brunoais: i made no changes
[01:28:33] <fattest> im reading the selectors page you linked me
[01:31:55] <brunoais> fattest, you only need 1 of the selectors
[01:32:01] <brunoais> dopie, http://jsfiddle.net/8NzQE/2/
[01:32:06] <brunoais> that's more inline to what you want
[01:32:24] <brunoais> a month is a number between 1 and 12 that is an integer (step=1)
[01:33:32] <brunoais> dopie, if you need backwards support for browsers that do not support the input@type=button, then you may try finding a polyfill
[01:33:54] <brunoais> makes no sense not to use such useful thing when it is available in all updated browsers
[01:34:08] <fattest> E[foo="bar"] ?
[01:34:22] <brunoais> fattest, yeah, that's what you need
[01:35:40] <fattest>  brunoais: how do i use this?
[01:35:51] <brunoais> fattest, do you know what that selector is?
[01:36:02] <fattest> brunoais: indeed!
[01:36:19] <brunoais> fattest, do you know what a DOM Node is?
[01:36:29] <fattest> i do not
[01:36:43] <brunoais> fattest, you are using them, though
[01:36:56] <fattest> ok
[01:37:18] <brunoais> fattest, do you know querySelector()?
[01:37:44] <fattest> yes
[01:38:48] <brunoais> fattest, do you know you can apply that on any Element of the page?
[01:38:56] <brunoais> that way you do a "sandboxed" search?
[01:39:04] <fattest> var el = audio[0].querySelector(".myclass"); ?
[01:39:39] <brunoais> fattest, you are not after a class
[01:39:47] <fattest> after an attribute right?
[01:39:56] <fattest> or text
[01:40:04] <brunoais> fattest, "class" is an attribute
[01:40:13] <brunoais> but it's a different one, yes
[01:40:22] <fattest> we are after text
[01:41:57] <fattest> so what should i do?
[01:42:40] <brunoais> " <fattest> <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/bolero_69/Bolero.mp3">" <- How do you find that tag in the DOM given what your code already knows
[01:43:12] <fattest> my code knows href
[01:44:06] <fattest> var test = $('a[href= audio[0].currentSrc]'); ?
[01:50:25] <wp_jon> How do I get the JSON response from an ajax call and put an IF condition on it?
[01:50:46] <dopie> brunoais, any luck?
[01:51:17] <brunoais> dopie, I thought I wrote something for you
[01:51:26] <brunoais> dopie, did you miss it?
[01:51:28] <dopie> in the fiddle?
[01:51:28] <wp_jon> .. e.g. JSON resonse is {"result":"success"}. I want to say if (jsonResponse['result'] == "success" ) {}
[01:51:39] <brunoais> dopie, here, in the channel
[01:51:43] <fattest> brunoais: i got this http://jsfiddle.net/vkMqR/953/
[01:51:51] <dopie> brunoais, write it again please
[01:51:52] <dopie> :)
[01:52:59] <brunoais> <brunoais> dopie, http://jsfiddle.net/8NzQE/2/

[01:52:59] <brunoais> <brunoais> a month is a number between 1 and 12 that is an integer (step=1)

[02:04:44] <brunoais> dopie, I also want ot try myself :D
[02:04:57] <dopie> hehehe
[02:05:00] <dopie> found a plugin for it
[02:05:01] <dopie> :)
[02:06:32] <brunoais> dopie, I usually go over that
[02:06:40] <brunoais> I prefer to learn
[02:06:52] <dopie> i agree but im very very very new to jquery
[02:06:54] <dopie> :)
[02:07:16] <brunoais> dopie, I was that too
[02:07:19] <brunoais> then I read the source code
[02:07:27] <brunoais> then I became to know how it does things
[02:07:44] <brunoais> I'm actually here to also learn more how to manipulate the DOM using jQuery
[02:07:50] <brunoais> I'm more used to use the DOM directly
[02:23:31] <brunoais> dopie, pls try this:
[02:23:32] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/8NzQE/3/
[02:23:35] <brunoais> also for the lulz
[02:30:22] <wp_jon> brunoais: not sure if you're still considering my question, but I think I've found solution. Thanks anyway :)
[02:30:43] <brunoais> wp_jon, *facepalm* I forgot about you!!!
[02:30:45] <brunoais> sorry
[02:30:53] <wp_jon> haha dont worry

[03:43:41] <rocky> anyone using intern know how to hide test coverage reports for anything contained within node_modules/* ? i've tried all the options i can think of
[04:28:25] <brunoais> rocky, I don't understand the question
[04:28:40] <brunoais> dopie, did you try my suggestion?
[04:29:10] <rocky> brunoais, i'm running intern-client to run my tests... when it's done it spits out code coverage for all my tests *plus* coverage for all third-party modules it used from my nodes_module... i do not want/care to see the test results from third-party libs
[04:30:05] <brunoais> rocky, I'm too out on what you are saying... I cannot help you :S
[04:33:38] <wirehack7> hello, I wonder why this wont work: $('article section.post-content p img').wrap('<a href="'+$(this).attr('src')+'" rel="lightbox" title="'+$(this).atrr('alt')+'"></a>'); href is 'undefined' now. how to fix that? thanks for help!
[04:34:01] <wirehack7> oh, typo, atrr = attr, but same error with undefined
[04:40:53] <jphase> wirehack7: not sure if someone already answered you but it looks like $(this) doesn't have a context in that example
[04:41:29] <wirehack7> oh
[04:41:39] <wirehack7> oh god, i am stupid, yeah there is each() missing
[05:24:41] <eskatrem> hey, if I access to a class with $(".my-class").click(function(){}), can I know the specifics of the elements I am accessing? (I am interested in the text that is inside)
[05:25:09] <JackBauer24> eskatrem: Just use $(this) inside of anonymous function
[05:26:21] <eskatrem> JackBauer24: like $(".my-class").click($(this){doStuff(this.val())}); ?
[05:27:21] <JackBauer24> no, like function(){$(this).stuff()}
[05:27:34] <eskatrem> let me see...
[05:32:19] <eskatrem> doesn't work with $(this).innerHTML
[05:33:53] <eskatrem> oh, nevermind, it works with $(this).text()
[05:34:12] <brunoais> eskatrem, jQuery does not have the innerHTML parameter
[05:34:19] <brunoais> eskatrem, careful that those 2 are not the same
[05:35:03] <eskatrem> brunoais: in my case, I just have stuff like <div class="touch">some specific text for this element</div>
[05:35:23] <eskatrem> so .text() is what I want, I suppose :)
[05:35:38] <brunoais> eskatrem, what you want is the DOM's textContent attribute which is jQuery's .text(), yes
[05:35:52] <brunoais> you were trying to do with innerHTML which is HTML, not plain text :)
[05:36:35] <eskatrem> I guess it would be different if my elements contained other HTML elements, but I don't have this level of complexity yet

[06:50:43] <laravelnewbie> hey
[06:50:48] <laravelnewbie> help me i need help
[06:51:14] <laravelnewbie> vladikoff
[06:52:31] <laravelnewbie> How to cancel slideToggle()? return false is not suitable http://laravel.io/bin/oX1G2
[06:53:26] <laravelnewbie> #js
[06:54:14] <decx> what the hell are you doing
[06:54:29] <Dolfly> o
[06:54:38] <laravelnewbie> How to cancel slideToggle()? return false is not suitable http://laravel.io/bin/oX1G2
[06:55:04] <decx> doesnt make sense to me
[06:55:44] <laravelnewbie> decx help me
[06:57:08] <decx> why dont you put that shit in a usable demo
[06:58:23] <zylophone> speaking about usable demos - http://jsfiddle.net/f89DQ/1/ - why isn't the opacity being updated when hovered?
[07:00:48] <zylophone> it would appear, it's not even recognising the hovered event
[07:02:06] <decx> just don't use hover
[07:02:23] <decx> it's just calling mouseenter, mouseout in the back anyway
[07:02:47] <zylophone> well that's cool cause it saves me doing that, right?
[07:02:55] <decx> i'd just use css
[07:03:15] <decx> like
[07:03:15] <decx> .element-bar:hover { opacity: 1}
[07:03:48] <zylophone> i want the element-bar to be affected when the whole div is hovered though
[07:04:27] <decx> #workspace:hover .element-bar
[07:05:09] <zylophone> .element-row:hover .element-bar works great...
[07:05:24] <zylophone> until there's a nested element inside
[07:08:40] <laravelnewbie> decs this is impossibble
[07:09:02] <decx> you just want to prevent the slide when you click .expand?
[07:09:26] <krambiorix> hi, when using autocomplete, i try to select an item with arrow up and down, then i select it with enter, but the value is not placed in the input field...Anyone any idea?
[07:09:59] <decx> laravelnewbie http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8pWEe/
[07:14:17] <decx> default behaviour already puts the item you select with arrows into the field
[07:21:14] <laravelnewbie> decx http://jsfiddle.net/8pWEe/1/
[07:21:33] <laravelnewbie> return false not suitable
[07:23:04] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8pWEe/2/
[07:23:59] <laravelnewbie> decx thanks you very much
[07:24:37] <decx> why bother putting the click function on fieldset if you juts want .param a to activate it
[07:38:40] <laravelnewbie> decx In this approach, by clicking on .sended-param ajax request is not sent. .sended-param lies within .expand
[07:44:16] <Crucials> hey. Im trying to use jquery ui's tooltip widget thingy. I want to assign some custom content (I have a class with a bunch of different content options in there)
[07:44:48] <Crucials> I want to choose the appropriate content by getting the class of the div
[07:44:53] <zylophone> am i right in assuming that if a div has .data applied to it, then .html() won't convert that to data- html?
[07:46:03] <decx> yes
[07:46:21] <zylophone> that sucks! it means i have to ... actually do work!
[07:46:51] <Crucials> I have something like this: http://hastebin.com/zicekawoxe.coffee
[07:47:17] <Crucials> what it does is only call .tooltip the second time I over over the div
[07:47:48] <decx> don't init tooltip on mouseover that happens many times per second
[07:48:12] <Crucials> I tried wwith mouseenter, and it does the same
[07:48:26] <Crucials> im assuming i should only init it once
[07:48:31] <Crucials> but I'm not sure how?
[07:48:39] <laravelnewbie> Hlpe me
[07:48:40] <laravelnewbie> help[
[07:48:41] <laravelnewbie> hepl
[07:49:37] <Crucials> decx: I tried with .ready() too, thinking it would initialize it once at the start
[07:49:48] <Crucials> but ready seems to be too early somehow, and the class ends up empty
[07:50:01] <decx> set up a demo
[07:51:28] <Crucials> decx: Im not sure I can use jquery ui in jsfiddle, can I?
[07:51:42] <decx> 202, then ui below
[07:52:32] <laravelnewbie> dexc console.log("Ssss"); doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/8pWEe/3/
[07:53:39] <laravelnewbie> oh sorry
[07:53:41] <laravelnewbie> sorry
[07:53:45] <laravelnewbie> decx sorry works
[07:53:47] <laravelnewbie> this work
[07:56:35] <Crucials> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/Uqzp6/
[07:58:01] <decx> Crucials http://jsfiddle.net/decx/x5Jq5/
[07:59:22] <Crucials> decx: very pretty. thanks!
[08:00:28] <Crucials> decx: would this be a problem when using multiple tooltips on the same page?
[08:00:37] <Crucials> from different objects
[08:01:29] <decx> well this will run the content function on any .item
[08:01:43] <decx> if there is not data-content then it would crash and burn
[08:02:05] <decx> but you can normalize that inside the function
[08:02:17] <Crucials> im not worried about crashing and burning right now
[08:02:39] <Crucials> but something like this
[08:02:40] <zylophone> are there any html clean / formatter plugins anyone can recommend?
[08:02:51] <Crucials> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/x5Jq5/1/
[08:05:37] <Crucials> decx: I suppose this could work, but if there is a more elegant solution i'd prefer that
[08:05:38] <Crucials> http://jsfiddle.net/x5Jq5/2/
[08:06:57] <decx> yeah that'll do
[08:09:11] <decx> else { return $(this).attr('title') } so it works on tooltips with neither item, other or the data-content
[08:12:23] <picoo> Hey everyone, how i can check with jquery on what website i'm ? i mean locally my website is under .dev and public under .com  i need to check this.
[08:12:59] <Crucials> works flawlessly for now, decx, thanks a bunch
[08:17:59] <picoo> hm
[08:19:55] <picoo> ?
[08:20:54] <Es0teric> I want to trigger a .hover on each individual div that is .content... i dont want to hover on one .content div and it triggers the others at the same time
[09:46:25] <puchacz> hi, how do I put a string into an empty iframe please?
[09:46:58] <puchacz> string containing html
[09:47:40] <decx> puchacz http://api.jquery.com/contents
[09:48:11] <puchacz> just this? $("#browserIframe").contents().children().html("whatever")
[09:48:13] <puchacz> ?
[09:49:52] <puchacz> well, calling $("#browserIframe").contents().html(data.htmlResponseStr); gives me an error
[09:50:13] <puchacz> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'createDocumentFragment' of null
[09:51:08] <anli> Why do I only read "4" in the alert box if I press the 5th button on http://jsfiddle.net/dtEGC/ ?
[09:51:20] <anli> I expect it to happen on the 5th and onwards
[09:51:24] <decx> puchacz contents().find('html').html('')
[09:52:40] <puchacz> decx: trying....
[09:53:10] <decx> index starts at 0 anli
[09:53:28] <anli> How is that relevant?
[09:53:38] <decx> no idea i didnt look close enough
[09:53:39] <decx> :>
[09:53:41] <anli> ;)
[09:53:48] <puchacz> decx: looks better, thx
[09:54:55] <decx> why wouldn't it say 4 anli ?
[09:55:17] <anli> I want it to say 4, but also on subsequent buttons
[09:55:44] <decx> but there's only one .four tr
[09:56:05] <decx> tr.prev('tr.four') on everything but 5 creates an empty object
[10:17:41] <puchacz> docx: your way did not work, I had to do this: http://pastebin.com/EWs8KJk1
[10:17:46] <puchacz> I don't understand these iframes.....
[10:42:06] <ravigehlot> My JSON data has a space just before the firstname. for example "[{" firstname that is causing problems...
[10:42:12] <ravigehlot> where is that coming from
[10:48:10] <jphase> ravigehlot: the description of your problem isn't very clear. JSON data would normally start with "[{"
[10:49:19] <jphase> maybe a pated example of the beginning of your string would help, and the origin of the data
[10:49:37] <jphase> s/pated/pasted
[10:50:04] <ravigehlot> jphase: let me past it for you
[10:50:48] <ElysiumNet> jphase: since when does json normally start with that?
[10:51:02] <ElysiumNet> "true" and "false" are returned without [{ at the start
[10:51:14] <jphase> an array of objects in JSON starts with that
[10:51:25] <puchacz> is iframe the only way of displaying foreign html with foreign css?
[10:51:29] <ElysiumNet> jphase: it can be []
[10:51:31] <jphase> most data sources are arrays of objects - not all, hence me saying "normally"
[10:51:34] <ElysiumNet> if I recall correctly
[10:51:47] <ravigehlot> jphase: http://pastebin.com/7rt6aaDv
[10:51:55] <jphase> sure, it can be several things based on what the data is
[10:52:05] <jphase> an array of objects will start with that
[10:52:29] <jphase> ravigehlot: that looks fine, what's the issue with the firstname exactly?
[10:52:42] <ElysiumNet> jphase: looks like lack of escaping
[10:52:42] <cnap_> hey people, I am going to try to ask something peculiar
[10:52:44] <ravigehlot> jphase: console.log shows only [{
[10:53:22] <ElysiumNet> he's copy-pasting this from the inspector, not the actual html source of the document
[10:53:44] <inDux> Sunday funday y’all
[10:54:03] <cnap_> I am echoing an error paragraph with php. Now I want to detect when this is echoed and throw a notification with jquery plugin Noty
[10:54:10] <jphase> ravigehlot: that shold work find
[10:54:14] <jphase> bah keyboard
[10:54:16] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/kw6Yc/
[10:54:31] <ElysiumNet> jphase: his problem is with HTML
[10:54:35] <abstrakt> cnap_, put a unique class on it and check for $('.some-unique-class-819384').length > 0
[10:54:36] <ElysiumNet> look carefully at the "'s
[10:54:54] <ElysiumNet> he's not escaping them
[10:54:58] <cnap_> abstrakt: so if this is > 0 I can throw a noty ?
[10:55:08] <jphase> well yeah, if it's going to be put in an attribute that makes sense
[10:55:12] <cnap_> abstrakt: but how will I be constantly check for that ?
[10:55:44] <cnap_> abstrakt: I tried doing this with on() but I dont know which event to use
[10:55:53] <abstrakt> cnap_, well constantly checking for that doesn't make sense anyway because PHP is not "constant"
[10:56:05] <abstrakt> you render a page once with PHP and that's it, you don't render again without refreshing the page
[10:56:11] <cnap_> abstrakt: right
[10:56:11] <puchacz> docx: your way of setting content s of iframe $("#browserIframe").contents().find("html").html(htmlResponseStr)
[10:56:17] <puchacz> gives this strange warning:
[10:56:34] <puchacz> Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html: "http://localhost:8080/bubo5/browser?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FInsect".
[10:56:43] <puchacz> where this url is my whole page url
[10:56:56] <abstrakt> cnap_, you probably just want onload, so $(function() { if ($('.someuniqueclss').length > )) { showNotify() }})
[10:57:46] <puchacz> whereas doc.open() doc.write(stringHere) works ok, but for some htmls it refuses to be displayed
[10:57:48] <jphase> ravigehlot: the quickest way around that is to just use single ' for your data attribute. If your data contains ' that will also be an issue though
[10:57:51] <puchacz> iframes are fragile
[10:58:02] <cnap_> abstrakt: it seems to work. Ok let me play. Thank you so much
[11:00:03] <jphase> ravigehlot: if you use jQuery to set the data attribute with .data rather than using PHP to echo it, it should work fine too
[11:01:04] <inDux> Do you guys have any advice/tutorials to build a dynamic form?
[11:01:19] <inDux> Like dynamically add/delete/edit text boxes with jquery?
[11:02:06] <abstrakt> inDux, yeah, use backbone
[11:02:10] <jphase> inDux: use .remove and create elements with $('<input type="text">').append($('#somecontainer'))  for example - there's plenty of ways to insert into the DOM
[11:02:17] <abstrakt> inDux, that's a bit generic though, hard to give "advice" on that
[11:02:29] <jphase> jQuery does it just fine on it's own - no need to use additional libraries
[11:02:37] <inDux> thanks guys
[11:02:49] <zylophone> could someone do me a favour please - go to google.com - and then click on the padlock icon, and copy/paste the sha1 of the certificate please
[11:02:55] <abstrakt> actually there's quite a need for some kind of structure
[11:02:57] <inDux> jphase: that makes sense
[11:03:00] <abstrakt> though you needn't use backbone specifically
[11:03:11] <abstrakt> jquery soup is pretty horrendous when it begins to grow in size
[11:03:40] <jphase> to each his/her own
[11:20:05] <inDux> What’s a “pretty” way to ask the user for input? I think alert boxes are ugly
[11:20:26] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:22:06] <inDux> yo
[11:23:05] <rindolf> inDux: hi.
[11:25:16] <cesurasean1> can someone tell me why the jquery on www.simpletechnology.us isn't working on the top right on my windows 8.1 phone?
[11:31:45] <kj_> greetings. i am hoping somebody can help me with the syntax of getting this js fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/sanchitos/FpPAg/22/ to work on my site. this is my current code http://pastebin.com/eiVGjQ2a but i am getting a ReferenceError: clicked is not defined error. I've never had any jquery issues I couldn't solve before so I am stumped. Big thanks for help. Cheers
[11:35:52] <inDux> Here’s a really really simple question
[11:36:26] <inDux> How do you determine if a variable is empty? Tried if($variable != null)
[11:38:54] <decx> seems to work fine kj_ but you don't need to add inline js, just bind that in your doc ready
[11:39:07] <decx> inDux depends on the kind of variable
[11:39:26] <inDux> decx: it’s from a prompt(), so empty I supposed
[11:39:32] <inDux> suppose*
[11:40:10] <inDux> decx: got it
[11:40:21] <inDux> the answer is ($variable !== ‘’)
[11:40:57] <kj_> @decx ... i need to add the     $(function() { wrapper for an external js drupal file.
[11:41:49] <decx> inDux $variable.length > 0 would also work
[11:42:52] <kj_> @decx you can see my implementation here http://saveurs.pyxio.com/products and it does not work. i get the reference error and i can't figure this out :(
[11:44:35] <decx> your clicked function would have to be defined inside window
[11:44:45] <decx> just bind inside your docready and get rid of the inline crap
[11:49:30] <decx> kj_ http://jsfiddle.net/decx/FpPAg/50/
[11:52:42] <ravigehlot> I have got a div that has data-regions="with some JSON data here". On Jquery, I am trying to retrieve the with $(this).find(
[11:53:17] <kj_> decx: wow. you are genius. many many many many many thanks.
[11:53:27] <ravigehlot> I have got a div that has data-regions="with some JSON data here". On Jquery, I am trying to retrieve the with $(this).find( '.thisclass' ).data( 'regions' ). Upon trying to console.log that, I only see [{ instead of the whole JSON data. what's going on
[11:53:41] <decx> notice that i removed all the anchors from the second slider, there are now just img in the .slide
[11:54:28] <decx> i'm sure there's a nicer way to have 2 bxslider communicate their position than that index(this) workaround
[11:56:25] <jphase> ravigehlot: we've already given you an explanation of your problem. if you're going to do something like data-regions="<?php echo $jsondata; ?>" then use single '' instead. using jQuery to set the JSON object data into the attribute with .data would be the better approach
[11:57:31] <decx> kj_ found a function attached to the bxslider object just do slider.goToSlide(carousel.getCurrentSlide()); instead of the index stuff
[11:57:35] <ravigehlot> jphase: my apologizes, I didn't see your answer
[11:58:53] <ravigehlot> jphase: That worked!!!!
[12:01:23] <kj_> decx: fantastic. i have too much to learn still in jquery :(
[12:05:40] <decx> kj_ that wasnt jquery per se, i just did console.log(carousel) and looked which functions bx slider attached to it
[12:07:55] <kj_> decx: OK thanks. i am trying to wrap my head around it by studying your code and what lead you to that conclusion. my specialty is drupal site building and bootstrap theming ... but i would love to become somewhat competent in jquery. you have helped me because i can compare what worked and didn't work. many thanks again
[12:17:52] <Dev0n> Hey, trying to figure out how I should apprach this. If I want the images to not be displayed (also not be requested with GET) unless the user triggers it by clicking on a button of something, I could have an img element with an empty src and a data attribute with the correct url.
[12:18:08] <Dev0n> That way, I can get jquery to swap the attribute values when the users triggers it?
[12:18:15] <Dev0n> is that a good way of goign about this?
[12:19:29] <decx> either put a very low res image, a transparent pixel, or a loading gif, i don't know if empty src is invalid but i don't think i'Ve ever seen it
[12:21:31] <decx> yeah empty src is invalid
[12:53:27] <Dev0n> cool, thanks decx
[12:58:29] <visualshock> How can I get the content/value of a class?
[12:58:39] <Dev0n> decx, http://probablyprogramming.com/2009/03/15/the-tiniest-gif-ever
[12:58:40] <Dev0n> hehe :)
[13:00:53] <decx> that'S the tiniest 1px transparent
[13:01:00] <decx> wouldnt data:image/gif;base64,0 be the tiniest
[13:03:30] <Dev0n> is that valid decx?
[13:03:42] <Dev0n> browser support wise, I'm only getting 6 results on google for it
[13:03:57] <decx> it's not a valid image
[13:04:05] <decx> but i guess better than src="" :>
[13:04:39] <Dev0n> gotcha
[13:05:33] <Dev0n> also, if I want to wrap an piece of data around in an element, would I best use span? I don't want any styling, only want to be able to assign this element a class id for jquery to pick up on
[13:06:05] <decx> depends on the data
[13:06:14] <Dev0n> a list of emails
[13:07:02] <decx> span will do
[13:07:30] <decx> but you can also use data- for data
[13:08:11] <Dev0n> I want the email to be disabled too
[13:08:15] <Dev0n> or did you mean something else?
[13:08:18] <Dev0n> displayed*
[13:09:21] <decx> i don't know what you're doing
[13:09:38] <decx> like <li data-email="a@b.c" data-id="348df8g8d" data-name="Ann Example">Ann Example, 221B Baker Street, Thereland</li>
[13:10:01] <decx> now $('li').data('email') gives you a@b.c
[13:11:18] <Dev0n> ahh yea, gotcah, yea I know about the data- attrs, I just wanted to display the email but be able to select with jquery, the way I've placed it makes it not hard but cumbersome to select
[13:36:19] <Dev0n> decx, data:image/gif;base64,0 fails to load :(
[13:36:26] <Dev0n> guess browsers don't really support it
[13:36:30] <Dev0n> (Firefox)
[13:56:06] <visualshock> How can I trigger a function when the mouse is over class x?
[13:57:21] <__joshua___> $('.x').on('mouseenter', my_func);
[13:57:28] <tw2113> `g jquery hasClass
[13:57:29] <b-ot> tw2113: .hasClass() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/hasclass/
[13:58:04] <tw2113> $('someselector).on('hover',function(){ });
[13:58:25] <tw2113> if ( $(this).hasClass('x') ) { myfunction(); }
[13:58:45] <tw2113> worth a try
[14:10:35] <dddh> hi
[14:11:11] <dddh> I need examples of datatables filter with my own date pickers
[14:12:30] <__joshua___> several ways to do it.  i pass all dates as epochs, use a mRender to turn them to dates, and do range filter
[14:16:00] <dddh> :(
[14:17:27] <__joshua___> find.  i googles datatables date range.  https://www.datatables.net/forums/discussion/313/filter-date-range
[14:17:33] <__joshua___> fine*
[14:26:32] <dddh> __joshua___: I already have a HTML page with datepickers and a table
[14:27:06] <__joshua___> ok.  then what are you asking?
[14:27:30] <dddh> __joshua___: I wish I could just import datatables js and somehow pass data from existing datepickers to filter
[14:27:58] <__joshua___> you mean repopulate the filter?>
[14:28:03] <__joshua___> prepopulate*
[14:29:43] <dddh> __joshua___: I don't want to use datatables' input fields, I want to pass data from my own datepickers
[14:30:00] <__joshua___> pass data?
[14:30:10] <__joshua___> do you want to use your own custom filter inputs?
[14:30:54] <dddh> yes, my own datepickers :(
[14:32:15] <dddh> __joshua___: like here http://jquery-datatables-column-filter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/external.html
[14:35:25] <__joshua___> like this? https://datatables.net/examples/plug-ins/range_filtering.html
[14:37:15] <dddh> yes
[14:38:06] <dddh> __joshua___: .keyup is something like onchange?
[14:38:39] <__joshua___> something like.  its when (most) key board keys are released
[14:38:57] <__joshua___> if you have a datepicker, use its change event
[14:42:00] <dddh> thankk you, I'll try
[14:58:23] <dddh> __joshua___: "This widget manipulates its element's value programmatically, therefore a native change event may not be fired when the element's value changes."
[15:19:05] <__joshua___> dddh: the native change event, the widget will likely emit it's own
[15:32:35] <cesurasean> can someone tell me why the jquery on www.simpletechnology.us isn't working on the top right on my windows 8.1 phone?
[15:33:42] <ElysiumNet> SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[15:34:12] <ElysiumNet> ... bah
[15:34:48] <ElysiumNet> cesurasean: you have a typo in your document
[15:35:00] <cesurasean> where?
[15:35:30] <ElysiumNet> cesurasean: double check line 26
[15:37:35] <cesurasean> ElysiumNet, i changed it to $('.navbar-toggle').on('click', function() {
[15:37:38] <cesurasean> still doesn't work.
[15:38:14] <ElysiumNet> what is it actually supposed to do? I see nothing in the top right in firefox
[15:38:39] <cesurasean> in mobile, there is a button on the right side, and those links up top right on firefox don't show up.
[15:40:59] <ElysiumNet> cesurasean: why are you putting javascript in the <head> element?
[15:41:13] <ElysiumNet> put that stuff right above </body>
[15:41:27] <ElysiumNet> and wrap your javascript in something so that it runs after it's done loading the page
[15:44:45] <cesurasean> ElysiumNet, ok it's working now. how would i go about telling it to hide the menu once its clicked again?
[15:44:57] <ElysiumNet> tried toggle() instead of show() ?
[15:46:41] <cesurasean> doesn't work.
[15:49:06] <cesurasean> ElysiumNet, any other ideas?
[15:49:40] <ElysiumNet> you need to actually update it
[15:56:22] <cesurasean> ElysiumNet, I did, and I tried that. Didn't work.
[15:56:25] <cesurasean> so I reversed the changes.
[16:08:52] <cesurasean> ElysiumNet, nevermind. it does work!
[16:20:38] <inDux> is it possible to have jquery version conflicts?
[16:20:49] <inDux> I can use this jquery map plugin on a vanilla html page just fine
[16:21:11] <inDux> when I try to use it on my site, the script loads but doesn’t change the div to a map
[16:25:07] <BillCriswell> inDux: Any error in the console?
[16:32:13] <inDux> BillCriswell: no, but I ran the function in the console and it fixed the problem
[16:32:21] <inDux> Too bad the users can just do that haha
[16:33:56] <BillCriswell> inDux: Are you running it between two different versions of jQuery?
[16:35:55] <inDux> BillCriswell: I know the bootstrap theme I’m using has jquery included
[16:37:10] <BillCriswell> inDux: Try narrowing your copies of jQuery down to one copy, the newest version, and see what happens.
[16:40:40] <inv3nt0r> hi everyone
[17:48:52] <jnz> What's the most performance optimial way to animate position
[17:48:56] <jnz> in chrome
[17:50:42] <__joshua___> sometimes is css3 transformations.  sometimes its by requestAnimationFrame. you probably want to benchmark
[17:51:38] <mobile8> whats the fastest way to fetch instagram amount of likes and comments based on insta gram image url?
[17:52:06] <__joshua___> fastest?  odd
[17:52:35] <__joshua___> probably with the instagram dev api
[17:52:37] <mobile8> easiest or whatever
[17:53:09] <jnz> hmm
[17:53:14] <mobile8> nvm found it
[17:53:47] <jnz> __joshua___: http://203.86.203.162/crep/home.html
[17:53:55] <jnz> if you scroll on chrome you can see the issue
[17:54:59] <__joshua___> yeah i can see the problem
[17:56:02] <jnz> could be the slider
[17:56:14] <jnz> if you scroll when its sliding
[17:57:37] <__joshua___> hmmm, jquery doesn't use rquestanimationframe
[17:58:35] <jnz> i dont see performance issue in ff or IE
[17:59:28] <__joshua___> mine works fine a chrome, after a time
[18:00:25] <jnz> hmm
[19:23:18] <thinkxl> Any valid way to do this? $('meta[name$="og:*"]'); ?
[19:23:50] <thinkxl> $('meta[property$="og:*"]'); <-- corrected, this way?
[19:28:45] <systemfault> Why $= ?
[19:29:07] <systemfault> (And no, you can't use wildcards like that)
[19:31:52] <thinkxl> systemfault using wrong this: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[19:32:08] <thinkxl> I think the only option is $('head').html().indexOf('og:') > -1;
[19:32:31] <systemfault> thinkxl: What about telling us what you actually want to do?
[19:32:51] <systemfault> Instead of asking us how to fix weird non-valid code.
[19:33:00] <thinkxl> systemfault know if there is some rich snippets in the document
[19:33:21] <systemfault> I don't know what a rich snippet is… sorry.
[19:33:31] <thinkxl> I'm getting the xml from YQL and using xmlDOM to convert it to a dom to use jQuery
[19:33:47] <thinkxl> systemfault ok np thanks
[20:35:00] <sunbeam> hi, how can I remove all :hover attributes for an element?
[20:38:59] <unnu> hey
[20:39:28] <unnu> is there a event fired when you select an image to be uploaded?
[20:39:32] <unnu> file*
[20:46:26] <Fernandos> hi
[20:47:28] <Fernandos> how do I initialize the jquery plugin boilerplate without binding it to a selector? See: https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/#usage
[20:48:06] <Fernandos> I'd like to run $.defaultPluginName(); instead
[21:22:54] <filkinst_> i get an error when I try to run bundle install
[21:42:33] <traviata> I'm having a bit of trouble with my logic and hoping someone can help: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/3/  - I'm trying to make it so that when I scroll, it'll scroll down until the bottom of the image shows up at the bottom of the screen where it'll remain fixed while the text keeps scrolling. (kind of like this http://snag.gy/DLqsr.jpg where the image is fixed and text keeps scrolling)
[22:00:46] <hugg> traviata: maybe try posting on stackexchcange?
[22:02:46] <traviata> hugg: I could... but i'd rather just stick with irc so I can ask questions and understand in realtime
[22:05:11] <hugg> traviata: You may want to try skrollr.js
[22:51:01] <unnu> i hate bootstrap
[22:51:12] <unnu> jphase, you around?
[23:02:08] <beancurd> haha.
[23:04:23] <Uhkis> unnu: +1
