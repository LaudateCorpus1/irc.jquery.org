[00:03:21] <dachi_> in custom elements like <test><hello>SOMETHING</hello></test> child-elements do not get listed, like I can get $("test") but it does not contain child <hello> and also i can't get $("hello") if I won't move it outside <test> scope.
[00:03:32] <dachi_> is there any workaround here?
[00:05:52] <Technical_13> I don't suppose there is anyone here who can tell me why my callback isn't working right on http://ddowiki.com/page/User:Technical_13/vector.js
[00:06:33] <dachi_> i really don't have time sorry, i'm rushing over a deadline :(
[00:06:43] <Technical_13> dachi_: try $("test").find("hello") of just $("hello")?
[00:07:49] <dachi_> still does not work, i'll switch back to divs , tnx
[00:07:56] <Technical_13> Oh well, I'll ask again tomorrow 3AM here and I am poop.
[00:08:19] <Technical_13> dachi_: can you give hello an id?
[00:08:19] <dachi_> i'll bookmark and msg u
[00:08:24] <dachi_> if could find solution
[00:08:55] <Technical_13> with an id you could try $("test").find("#helloID") I would think
[00:09:31] <jphase> with an id you should be able to just grab it by selector (since there should only be one)
[00:09:50] <jphase> is .find not working for you dachi_?
[00:09:58] <Technical_13> that's true, if there are more than one, you could try using a class and changing the # to a .
[00:10:21] <Technical_13> b-ot api find
[00:10:21] <b-ot> Technical_13: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[00:11:31] <jphase> Technical_13: I think you need to pass that callback as a string for that to work
[00:12:00] <dachi_> what i am doing is writing a customizable template for users for jj query plugin to interact with like, <notify><heading></heading><foreach notification><notification><title><date><content>……. so they can move around things, make own templates
[00:12:14] <jphase> or no, I'm probably mixing this up with PHP - bouncing back and forth
[00:12:22] <dachi_> but child elements are not included in parents with query selectors, so i'll do same with divs probably
[00:13:10] <jphase> .find is recursive, but only relative to the parent it's called on
[00:13:31] <Technical_13> good night all.
[00:14:09] <dachi_> goodnight
[00:14:43] <jphase> so like $('body').find('whatever') would find every <whatever> tag in the <body> tag
[00:20:24] <dachi_> console.log($('un-repeat').prop('outerHTML')); this gives undefined while
[00:20:38] <dachi_> console.log($('#un-repeat').prop('outerHTML'));
[00:20:44] <dachi_> this gives itself as html string
[00:21:04] <dachi_> same with using .find
[00:24:04] <jphase> hm, would have to see the full structure I suppose
[00:24:24] <jphase> but one is a tag and one is a tag with that id
[00:24:31] <jphase> that's all I can seee that's different
[00:26:12] <dachi_> http://jsfiddle.net/cLcPj/
[00:26:14] <dachi_> js line 189
[00:26:29] <dachi_> sorry that code it's like 7 hours of work
[00:29:23] <dachi_> leave it please :)
[00:29:29] <dachi_> i'll just switch to divs
[00:29:37] <dachi_> maybe later i'll find something
[00:29:48] <dachi_> thank you a lot!! God bless you
[00:31:04] <jphase> oh, k
[00:31:14] <jphase> looking good though ;)
[00:31:32] <dachi_> :) :) thanks!
[00:31:53] <jphase> for being somewhat newer, this looks advanced and semantic :D
[00:32:25] <dachi_> :D :D
[00:45:10] <dachi_> jphase: it was all the - symbol in element names.. strange :D but nice
[00:45:45] <jphase> ahh, yeah your custom markup made it a bit tricky to troubleshoot
[00:52:27] <jphase> alright, it's officially reached the 4am mark, gotta sleep
[00:52:31] <jphase> ciao dachi_
[00:52:41] <dachi_> bye! thanks! have a good night
[00:52:42] <dachi_> ;) :)
[03:10:58] <wa5ted> there we go thought there was somethign wrong with my client
[03:13:24] <dachi_> a lot  left chatroom at 3:08
[03:16:37] <wa5ted> dachi_: it was my irc client
[03:17:02] <wa5ted> patchie: hey its me :P
[03:20:43] <Quest> how to submit a form by ajax and not reload the page?
[03:27:54] <dachi_> can you make a thing like, whatever happens to var X should happen to var Y
[03:29:36] <patchie> wa5ted: heheh..saw you now..hehe
[03:29:51] <wa5ted> hahaha
[03:30:57] <wa5ted> Quest: use jquery's $.post / $.get and then send to php script, process, and then use .done callback to read the the php outputted html/content
[04:02:08] <|RicharD|> hi to all
[04:02:51] <|RicharD|> there is a good plugin for do live editing text(that is on tag p/div) and use ajax for save in db ?
[04:03:45] <wa5ted> |RicharD|: why dont you write one, you can easily use contenteditable html5 property to accomplish that
[04:04:10] <|RicharD|> I was thinking for browser that not support html5
[04:12:01] <wa5ted> well what you can do
[04:12:11] <wa5ted> is have like an "edit..." button
[04:12:22] <wa5ted> and then when someone clicks
[04:12:24] <wa5ted> it
[04:12:30] <|RicharD|> wa5ted: anyway i was seeing here: http://caniuse.com/contenteditable
[04:12:36] <wa5ted> a textarea replaces the div temporarily
[04:12:43] <|RicharD|> possible that internet explorer 6 support it ?:S
[04:12:52] <wa5ted> i wouldnt trust it
[04:13:00] <wa5ted> seems like a more modern practice
[04:13:09] <wa5ted> you can try it i guess
[04:14:39] <|RicharD|> yep i must only download win xp :| I don't have it anymore...
[04:14:58] <wa5ted> well you can get win7 for free from microsoft
[04:15:01] <wa5ted> 30 trial
[04:15:11] <wa5ted> ill gladly share a file with you for activation
[04:15:12] <|RicharD|> I have win 7 ;)
[04:15:13] <|RicharD|> original
[04:15:20] <|RicharD|> but not have i.e. 6 :P
[04:15:22] <wa5ted> hahah
[04:15:26] <wa5ted> wellit shouldnt matter
[04:15:27] <wa5ted> tbh
[04:15:34] <wa5ted> its best that ie6,7,8 is phased out
[04:15:39] <wa5ted> thats why im on jquery 2.X
[04:15:52] <|RicharD|> ahahah :)
[04:16:11] <hopkins83> How to make Selectize.js preserve custom HTML5 data attributes (right now it's only preserving "data-value") when transforming regular <select> into Selectize.js dropdowns? http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/
[04:37:21] <wa5ted> hopkins83: i believe that selectize will use some sort of recursion or loop to enter all the elements into the new select
[04:37:42] <wa5ted> what you could do insert your code for the data-value in there
[04:42:27] <wa5ted> hopkins83: my cod eisnt perfect and requires a fix
[04:42:30] <wa5ted> but http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/1/
[04:42:38] <wa5ted> ^doing a recursion like that could help
[04:49:12] <hopkins83> wa5ted: Hey, that's pretty cool, thanks! =)
[04:49:27] <wa5ted> ya my code is incomplete but you sohuld be able to fix
[04:49:43] <hopkins83> wa5ted: But wouldn't it be easier to patch Selectize.js instead?
[04:49:51] <wa5ted> well thats what i said
[04:50:00] <wa5ted> you can look into the plugin and look for the loop
[04:50:04] <wa5ted> and then insert code in there
[04:50:10] <hopkins83> Oh i see i see
[04:50:19] <wa5ted> it would be hacking the plugin
[04:50:30] <wa5ted> see the selectize api and see if they have any open stuff for this
[04:50:37] <wa5ted> best to leave the plugin alone
[04:50:44] <wa5ted> maybe write a function
[04:50:52] <wa5ted> that takes an argument of a select
[04:51:05] <wa5ted> and then do your own independent loop
[04:51:08] <wa5ted> hopkins83: ^
[04:51:19] <hopkins83> hmmm
[04:51:30] <RandomGuy> when using the .fail method of .ajax, how can I get the URL that was called in the request?
[04:52:27] <wa5ted> hopkins83: I wrote the loop for you in my fiddle, so all you have to do is debug it (might be missing a semi colon or something)
[04:54:27] <hopkins83> wa5ted: Thank you so much
[04:54:58] <wa5ted> np
[04:59:36] <hopkins83> wa5ted: The console.log doesn't seem to be firing..
[04:59:51] <wa5ted> i know
[04:59:57] <wa5ted> there is somethign wrong with the code
[05:00:03] <wa5ted> i cant pt my finger on it
[05:00:06] <wa5ted> let me check
[05:00:29] <wa5ted> hopkins83: for selectize do you need all the cod ein the js window
[05:00:42] <hopkins83> nope i think we can take that out
[05:01:02] <hopkins83> was just incase we needed to patch selectize.js itself so i could turn it into a pull request or whatever
[05:01:47] <wa5ted> this isnot really a bug
[05:01:50] <wa5ted> but a feature
[05:04:12] <wa5ted> hopkins83: so i debugged apparently the region var isnt being set
[05:08:58] <hopkins83> wa5ted: yeah a feature sounds more right
[05:09:05] <hopkins83> wa5ted: how can that be?
[05:09:16] <wa5ted> how can what be?
[05:09:41] <hopkins83> the var thing. maybe we need to move it outside of the function or something?
[05:09:55] <wa5ted> what var thing
[05:10:10] <hopkins83> you said the region var isnt being set
[05:12:18] <wa5ted> ya im trying to figure that ut
[05:12:20] <wa5ted> i thin kselectize
[05:12:23] <wa5ted> is doing something weird
[05:12:33] <wa5ted> okay so it is geting set
[05:12:48] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/3/
[05:12:56] <wa5ted> selectize is messing stuff up but i have 1 mroe idea
[05:12:56] <battye> Hi, quick question... I'm starting out with jQuery, starting to learn it. Should I learn 2.0.3 or 1.10.2?
[05:13:08] <hopkins83> kewl
[05:13:33] <wa5ted> battye: difference between 2.x and 1.x is that 2.x deostn support ie 6,7,8
[05:13:40] <wa5ted> that is the main difference
[05:13:52] <wa5ted> i personally if i was starting out right now
[05:13:53] <wa5ted> use 1.10
[05:13:57] <wa5ted> but its up to you
[05:14:01] <wa5ted> battye: ^
[05:14:03] <battye> From my understanding, 2.0.3 doesn't support some older versions of IE. But I'm using a book that's a couple of years old to start learning jQuery, so I'm thinking for that reason I should look at learning the 1.10.2 version because it might correspond more closely to whats in the book?
[05:14:20] <wa5ted> well the documentation on jquery.com
[05:14:22] <wa5ted> is adequate
[05:14:28] <wa5ted> more adequate than a book
[05:14:41] <wa5ted> hopkins83: quick question is it just 1 select that woill be used or multiple
[05:14:45] <battye> are there big structural changes between 1.10.2 and 2.0.3?
[05:14:47] <wa5ted> cause then I hack hack accordingly
[05:14:51] <battye> in terms of the actual code?
[05:15:06] <battye> or will syntax and keywords etc from v1 transfer over to v2?
[05:15:16] <wa5ted> well with ie6,7,8 special cases had to be derived for some features
[05:15:17] <wa5ted> with its removal
[05:15:18] <hopkins83> wa5ted: sorry what do you mean?
[05:15:37] <battye> when is the end of life for v1?
[05:15:51] <battye> I'm not putting myself in a corner if I learn v1?
[05:15:55] <wa5ted> the jquery library became smaller
[05:15:59] <wa5ted> not at all
[05:16:11] <wa5ted> but once  ie 6,7,8 loses more favour
[05:16:15] <wa5ted> moving to 2.x
[05:16:18] <wa5ted> would be smart
[05:16:29] <battye> v1 skills will transfer over to v2 pretty easily?
[05:16:39] <wa5ted> hopkins83: like are you applying selectize to multiple selects or just 1
[05:16:40] <battye> no syntax/keywords/etc will change too much?
[05:16:50] <wa5ted> hopkins83: cause then I might as well edit plugin
[05:16:53] <hopkins83> wa5ted: oh yeah multiple selects.
[05:16:57] <wa5ted> battye: i dont think so
[05:17:02] <wa5ted> hopkins83: okay then
[05:17:05] <battye> okay, thanks for your help
[05:17:06] <hopkins83> god bless u mate
[05:17:15] <battye> I think I'll go with v1.10.2 then
[05:17:41] <wa5ted> battye: read this
[05:17:42] <wa5ted> http://blog.jquery.com/2013/05/24/jquery-1-10-0-and-2-0-1-released/
[05:18:05] <wa5ted> hopkins83: sure, let me think, i think a nested foreach would work :P
[05:18:13] * wa5ted starts to rub his hands
[05:18:21] <hopkins83> hehe
[05:18:29] <wa5ted> time for some boject arrays
[05:18:34] <wa5ted> *object
[05:18:48] <hopkins83> sweet!
[05:19:01] <wa5ted> wtf?
[05:19:09] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/4/
[05:25:33] <wa5ted> hopkins83: http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/5/
[05:25:39] <wa5ted> making some progress
[05:26:32] <wa5ted> hopkins83: this is where i am stuck, i will need a class for referencing which select is for which selectize element
[05:27:00] <wa5ted> hopkins83: http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/6/ <--current
[05:29:43] <hopkins83> wa5ted: looking really really good
[05:29:59] <wa5ted> ya hit a bit of a wall
[05:33:17] <ElysiumNet> hopkins83: why is he using attr() instead of data() ?
[05:37:07] <wa5ted> ElysiumNet: having a bit of trouble
[05:37:14] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/7/
[05:37:17] <wa5ted> last part
[05:37:25] <wa5ted> i cant read it properly from object array
[05:38:48] <ElysiumNet> you mean loading it into selectivize?
[05:39:48] <wa5ted> well after the selectivize plugin call
[05:39:55] <wa5ted> the ested foreach is not being read
[05:41:44] <ElysiumNet> 1) selectsArr is empty
[05:41:49] <ElysiumNet> 2) currentSelect has no children
[05:43:07] <ElysiumNet> you sure selectObj isn't supposed to be selectArr?
[05:44:17] <wa5ted> ElysiumNet: im doing an object array
[05:44:33] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: so what's selectsArr supposed to be then?
[05:44:47] <ElysiumNet> it's not filled, and you're trying to get the currently selected object from it?
[05:45:47] <ElysiumNet> the whole thing makes no sense
[05:46:22] <wa5ted> so basically selectArr
[05:46:27] <wa5ted> is the array of objects
[05:46:35] <wa5ted> and objects are psuhed to it
[05:46:41] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: and you've never pushed anything into it
[05:46:55] <wa5ted> oh fuck got rid of that line hold up
[05:47:02] <ElysiumNet> unless there is code missing from the fiddle
[05:47:53] <wa5ted> ElysiumNet: http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/9/
[05:48:05] <wa5ted> sry got rid of the console.logs and got rid that by accident
[05:49:27] <ElysiumNet> currentSelect.children() is still empty though
[05:49:47] <ElysiumNet> also, you probably don't want to do it this way
[05:50:03] <ElysiumNet> since it probably calls refreshItems() from time to time
[05:50:17] <wa5ted> true
[05:50:31] <wa5ted> ya the .children part isnt being read for some reason
[05:50:43] <wa5ted> hmmmm
[05:50:48] <wa5ted> im absolutely los :(
[05:50:50] <wa5ted> *lost
[05:51:33] <ElysiumNet> https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/plugins.md
[05:51:38] <ElysiumNet> you're probably going to depend on this
[05:52:01] <ElysiumNet> and override the refreshItems() method
[05:52:41] <ElysiumNet> or override the getItem() method so it returns an jquery element with your data attribute added to it
[05:53:14] <hopkins83> hi guys, sorry lost my net for a sec there
[05:53:53] <hopkins83> cool, yeah the selectize plugins! never thought of that, cheers ElysiumNet !
[05:54:34] <ElysiumNet> hopkins83: or he could just override the methods anyway, assuming selectize.js was properly written
[05:55:39] <wa5ted_> ElysiumNet: sry got disconnected
[05:55:47] <ElysiumNet> you've got to be kidding me
[05:56:01] <wa5ted_> what i miss
[05:56:21] <ElysiumNet> ElysiumNet: https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/plugins.md ElysiumNet: you're probably going to depend on this ElysiumNet: and override the refreshItems() method ElysiumNet: or override the getItem() method so it returns an jquery element with your data attribute added to it
[05:56:30] <wa5ted_> ya i got that part
[05:56:57] <wa5ted> hopkins83: still there?
[05:57:00] <ElysiumNet> should be done in a couple of lines and should work in the future with upgrades
[05:57:02] <hopkins83> hey yep
[05:57:10] <wa5ted> https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/plugins.md
[05:57:15] <wa5ted> use that it should help
[05:57:21] <wa5ted> kudos to ElysiumNet
[05:57:45] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/9/
[05:57:54] <Technical_13> Can anyone help me figure out why my callback isn't working in http://ddowiki.com/page/User:Technical_13/vector.js please?
[05:58:55] <wa5ted> hopkins83: if you use my code and the plugin stuff you should be able to accomplish what you need
[05:59:20] <wa5ted> hopkins83: you good to proceed from here
[05:59:34] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: it's actually a quite bit different
[05:59:47] <wa5ted> ElysiumNet: DO TELL
[05:59:52] <wa5ted> sry for caps
[05:59:57] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/api.md see the getItem() method
[06:00:21] <ElysiumNet> it literally returns the jquery object (html) for that item
[06:00:51] <ElysiumNet> function getItem(value) { var elem = this.prototype.getItem(value); elem.attr('data-region', 'blabla'); return elem; }
[06:01:24] <ElysiumNet> I haven't read what getItem *exactly* does, though
[06:02:12] <wa5ted> okay ill try it
[06:03:38] <ElysiumNet> heck, you could probably go directly with Selectize.getItem = function() {}, or at least on an instance of Selectize
[06:04:27] <wa5ted> true
[06:04:32] <wa5ted> hold let me explore a bit
[06:07:36] <wa5ted> ElysiumNet: but just from code point of view, my "hack" think should have worked
[06:08:42] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: but it won't
[06:09:23] <RandomGuy> when using the .fail method of .ajax, how can I get the URL that was called in the request?
[06:10:02] <wa5ted> ElysiumNet: you mind helping me finish cause im a bit lost
[06:10:09] <wa5ted> and stuff is really jumbled in my head
[06:10:25] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net/YaCPF/10/
[06:11:04] <ElysiumNet> :P
[06:11:27] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: because it won't work
[06:11:39] <wa5ted> well then how would you do it :P
[06:11:41] <ElysiumNet> it will keep re-rendering itself, so the .option elements might not even be there
[06:11:45] <ElysiumNet> I'm currently working on that
[06:11:49] <wa5ted> okay
[06:13:12] <ElysiumNet> the render method is what I was looking for
[06:15:17] <wa5ted> ahhhh
[06:15:18] <wa5ted> right
[06:15:27] <wa5ted> but my read function should cut the mustard right?
[06:15:31] <wa5ted> ElysiumNet: ^
[06:16:07] <ElysiumNet> could be simplified
[06:16:32] <bePolite> How do I pause the execution of subsequent functions in jquery
[06:16:37] <bePolite> something like sleep()
[06:22:59] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: http://jsfiddle.net/8NX2N/ here you go
[06:23:27] <ElysiumNet> result will contain raw html, so you might want to turn it into a jquery object first for easier manipulation, and then return raw html
[06:23:58] <wa5ted> ElysiumNet: so what does your code do?
[06:24:11] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: gives you a better starting point to work from :P
[06:24:17] <wa5ted> oh hahaha
[06:24:27] <wa5ted> hopkins83: i hope your keeping tabs
[06:24:55] <ElysiumNet> templateName is item/option, data contains a dictionary of the text, value and $order in the list
[06:25:38] <wa5ted> oh okay
[06:25:40] <ElysiumNet> you can grab on which instance you're working on there as well, directly from the library
[06:26:10] <ElysiumNet> wa5ted: https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/src/selectize.js#L1790
[06:27:07] <wa5ted> true
[06:27:14] <wa5ted> you know what the funny thing is
[06:27:17] <wa5ted> its not even my question
[06:27:21] <wa5ted> its hopkins83
[06:27:23] <wa5ted> and hes nota round
[06:27:25] <wa5ted> :P
[06:27:27] <ElysiumNet> ah :P
[06:27:33] <hopkins83> no im here im here taking notes
[06:27:48] <hopkins83> occasionally disappearing though due to bad wifi
[06:29:11] * ElysiumNet is also assuming that no 2 input values in a single select will be the same
[06:29:21] <ElysiumNet> *option
[06:29:42] <ElysiumNet> so you can just get the data attached to that option element by selecting for the value attribute
[06:34:22] <hopkins83> ElysiumNet: we should probably put this on hold now that wa5ted is gone
[06:35:09] <hopkins83> but thank you, thank you *sooooo* much for showing us the way
[06:49:12] <ElysiumNet> hopkins83: for some reason selectize seems to be mangling the original select element
[06:50:56] <hopkins83> hmmm thats odd
[06:54:54] <hopkins83> ElysiumNet: should i report tht as a bug at their github page?
[06:56:58] <hopkins83> damn wifi. if i stop responding for a while know that im trying desperately to get back online
[06:57:03] <ElysiumNet> you could. the only thing it should be doing to the original select element is just changing which one's selected, active, etc
[07:00:20] <ElysiumNet> hopkins83: http://jsfiddle.net/8NX2N/1/
[07:00:45] <ElysiumNet> nevermind, it doesn't do that right...
[07:01:18] <hopkins83> oh ok
[07:01:47] <ElysiumNet> http://jsfiddle.net/8NX2N/2/
[07:02:18] <ElysiumNet> wait, now it's sharing select elements... graah
[07:03:27] <ElysiumNet> anyway, I have other business to attend to for now
[07:03:30] <hopkins83> hehe
[07:03:42] <hopkins83> oh noes u leaving too?
[07:03:47] <ElysiumNet> yes, I have a job
[07:03:59] <hopkins83> well its been a pleasure ElysiumNet
[07:07:37] <bePolite> Please how do I make the blue box fade back in onmouseenter? http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/SZ2HT/
[07:13:08] <ElysiumNet> bePolite: what's with the timeout?
[07:14:48] <bePolite> ElysiumNet: to ensure that the two divs aren't displayed at once
[07:15:48] <ElysiumNet> bePolite: you do know that when one element goes over the other one, that basically counts as a "mouseleave"
[07:17:07] <bePolite> ElysiumNet: You are awsome
[07:17:36] <bePolite> I would have given you groundnuts through TCP/IP
[07:17:48] <bePolite> But then again its impossible
[07:18:37] <ElysiumNet> I'm allergic to nuts
[07:19:19] <hopkins83> :P
[07:19:48] <hopkins83> ElysiumNet: do lemme know if you come up with a way to fix the sharing elements thing
[07:20:43] <ElysiumNet> hopkins83: it's really about grabbing the state of the form. you can still do that before initializing Selectize and then pass it through to the instance
[07:23:34] <hopkins83> ElysiumNet: cool will note that down. probably have to wait for wa5ted to have it implemented though. im just a designer and this stuff is starting to get very very complex
[07:25:34] <Amirh> hi
[07:27:17] <Amirh> my code is based on changes of a textarea's content. when I paste a content using Ctrl+v it works fine but when I right-click and paste the content, it won't work.
[07:27:41] <Amirh> actually when I press space after the right-click+paste, it works fine then
[07:27:49] <Amirh> what's the problem?
[07:36:08] <Cork> Amirh: are you listing for the paste event?
[07:36:29] <Amirh> Cork: not it's based on content-change of the text-area
[07:36:44] <Cork> Amirh: "content change"?
[07:36:48] <Cork> the change event?
[07:38:03] <Amirh> Cork: keyup
[07:38:15] <Cork> ok that's why
[07:38:23] <Cork> ctrl+v is a key event
[07:38:23] <Amirh> what can I do?
[07:38:27] <Cork> context menu isn't
[07:38:36] <Cork> listen for the paste event
[07:38:48] <Cork> ?mdn paste event
[07:38:49] <b-ot> Cork: Element.onpaste - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.onpaste
[07:39:02] <Amirh> that's not enough, users could write what I'm looking for too. Cork
[07:39:18] <Cork> Amirh: i never said you should only use the paste event
[07:39:44] <Amirh> so I have to duplicated code for the paste event?
[07:39:48] <Cork> no
[07:39:53] <Amirh> duplicate*
[07:40:02] <Cork> on('keyup paste', function() {}) should work just fine
[07:40:17] <Cork> or name your function and use it that way if you prefer
[07:41:51] <Amirh> Cork: whell I used what you pasted here, it's like before.
[07:42:59] <bePolite> Please how do I make the green box fade in on mouse enter http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/SZ2HT/1/
[07:43:24] <Cork> Amirh: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/28u62/
[07:43:54] <Cork> bePolite: figcaption isn't an element
[07:43:57] <Cork> your css is wrong
[07:44:08] <Cork> uh..
[07:44:14] <Cork> actually your html is invalid too
[07:44:21] <grafi> everything is shitty!
[07:44:21] <Amirh> Cork: don't you need to type space-key after you paste from context menu?
[07:44:31] <Cork> Amirh: nope
[07:45:12] <Amirh> interesting
[07:45:16] <bePolite> Cork: whats it please
[07:45:37] <Cork> bePolite: you have elements that doesn't exist in your html
[07:47:00] <bePolite> Cork I have http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/SZ2HT/2/
[07:47:07] <bePolite> but It doesn't still work
[07:47:12] <Cork> Amirh: what browser are you using?
[07:47:26] <Cork> Amirh: you might not have the clopboard events or have them disabled
[07:47:43] <grafi> doesnt work in firefox Cork
[07:47:48] <grafi> at least not for em
[07:47:50] <grafi> me*
[07:48:28] <Amirh> Cork: both on firefox and chrome it doesn't work when use context-menu I have to press the space-key
[07:49:06] <Cork> hmm
[07:49:10] <Cork> does this one work better http://jsfiddle.net/28u62/1/ ?
[07:49:50] <grafi> magic oô
[07:50:06] <Amirh> Cork: great!!!!! thanks
[07:50:07] <grafi> how come
[07:50:09] <grafi> ...
[07:50:22] <Cork> the paste event is so you can modify the content before it is added
[07:50:32] <grafi> i see
[07:50:35] <Cork> the timeout lets it wait for the content to end up in the element
[07:50:39] <grafi> yup
[07:50:56] <grafi> i assumed the paste was already done by the time the handler was called
[07:51:05] <grafi> cool stuff
[07:51:35] <Cork> it is meant for wysiwyg editors
[07:52:02] <Cork> so when ex. you paste word data it can clean it up and possibly add html format for it
[07:52:31] <grafi> pretty neat, never came across that :P
[07:52:38] <Cork> it is also used to spy on what you are interested on in a page, so i normally have it disabled
[07:52:56] <grafi> how does that work?
[07:53:02] <Cork> oncopy
[07:53:09] <grafi> ah well
[07:53:11] <Cork> when you copy content from the page they get an event
[07:53:20] <grafi> yeah sure
[07:53:25] <Cork> and can modify what you copy before it ends up in your buffer
[07:53:37] <grafi> pretty scary
[07:53:38] <grafi> :x
[07:53:39] <grafi> :P
[07:56:04] <bePolite> How do I put jquery code in external js file
[08:06:32] <WG1337> Hi! I have a problem. http://mdsketch.loot.lv   If you press "Par mums" and then "Komanda", then you can see that those buttons seem to go way outside the page. Is there a way to fix it?
[08:09:48] <toothrot> WG1337, the buttons don't seem to go outside the page for me in FF, but the loaded content jumps all over the place
[08:13:19] <WG1337> toothrot: ahh, yeah, on Chrome those buttons jump out, but on FF the content jumps out
[08:14:31] <toothrot> actually it does the same for me in chromium (older chromium... 30.x), the buttons only move up and down as the content changes
[08:18:46] <WG1337> toothrot: yeah, I see that now too, I guess I need to work on that animation more

[08:58:23] <bid> hi, anyone have a demo/tut for a wheel progressbar (not preloader)?
[10:04:35] <shrdlu-> duders, this used to work in 1.8: if ($(ui.tab).attr('href') == "#welcome") {
[10:04:49] <shrdlu-> has it been changed to something? isn't working in 1.10.2
[10:05:27] <ElysiumNet> shrdlu-: consult the manual
[10:05:29] <ElysiumNet> and console.log()
[10:06:03] <shrdlu-> very helpful, thanks
[10:06:05] <shrdlu-> anyone else?
[10:07:37] <shrdlu-> "help me with this on term query which will be universally known to have changed"
[10:07:42] <shrdlu-> "rtfm"
[10:07:44] <toothrot> i think that's decent advice
[10:07:49] <toothrot> i mean the console.log part
[10:07:56] <toothrot> see what $(ui.tab).attr('href') is
[10:08:53] <shrdlu-> console isn't saying anything
[10:11:41] <toothrot> what do you mean?
[10:14:01] <shrdlu-> I'm looking at the console and it isn't returning anything
[10:15:05] <toothrot> the console.log call isn't happening?
[10:18:07] <shrdlu-> what do you mean 'call'?
[10:18:36] <shrdlu-> how does one call console.log?
[10:19:03] <toothrot> console.log('i just called console.log')
[10:19:33] <toothrot> it's a function, you call it. a function call...
[10:20:00] <shrdlu-> so how would they help me find out why if "($(ui.tab).attr('href') == "#welcome") {" no longer works in 1.10.2?
[10:20:06] <shrdlu-> that
[10:20:59] <toothrot> oh i don't know, something like `console.log('href value is:', $(ui.tab).attr('href'))`
[10:21:20] <toothrot> then you can see why it might fail the comparison
[10:23:25] <cameron262> can i somehow distort an image based on its colour using js?
[10:24:06] <cameron262> actually by its contrast
[10:24:18] <cameron262> so for example a black pixel surrounded by white pixels would be enlarged
[10:25:09] <cameron262> actually
[10:25:11] <cameron262> nevermind
[10:25:34] <cameron262> wait no just forget about the enlargement part, i want to assign contrast values to every pixel though
[10:37:26] <fabiobik> hello, Im trying to accomplish one thing... when i click on the button "OK", i'm hidding the tr. But when i go to the last tr, i want to make something like alert("Its the last tr")
[10:51:40] <shrdlu-> christ. I had to change it to "if (ui.newPanel.attr('id') == "how_to_order") {"
[10:51:54] <shrdlu-> as if that was in any way documented in the manual
[10:52:02] <shrdlu-> fuck computers and fuck the internet

[11:18:09] <AliG1000> I have a function here: http://jsfiddle.net/msPzJ/1/ which is kind of working, but not quite.  I want to click on a <tr> of a table, get the data-messageid of that <tr> and then load in the content using a GET.  I can hard-code the url and it works, but I can't pass the data-messageid as a parameter into the url.  Can anyone help?
[11:20:40] <AliG1000> it looks as though it should work, but it's not quite there
[11:23:53] <AliG1000> i.e. messages_id should equal the data-messageid of the <tr>.  The first section works and alerts "you clicked on row 3'
[11:24:17] <AliG1000> but, how do I get that '3' into the rest of it so I can build the url?
[11:28:07] <shoky> AliG1000: you passed the messageid as an argument to loadMessage
[11:29:27] <AliG1000> shoky: yes, but how can I make it appear in the parameter?
[11:29:57] <shoky> AliG1000: {'messages_id': resetMenu}
[11:30:00] <AliG1000> I am trying to create this url:  inbox_view.php?messages_id=3
[11:30:11] <AliG1000> let me try that
[11:31:58] <AliG1000> yay - it worked!  thank you.  you have no idea how long I was trying to get that to work!!

[13:29:39] <dekiss2> jQuery.browser
[13:29:45] <dekiss2> this still works?
[13:30:41] <dekiss2> here  jQuery('#header_images div, .header_image').('opacity', '1!important');
[13:30:41] <dekiss2>  I get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[13:31:07] <dekiss2> this is in if(jQuery(browser).msie) block
[13:31:23] <wa5ted> grafi: well everything is serachable
[13:31:28] <wa5ted> im trying to keep a clean profile
[13:31:41] <wa5ted> i myself have dived into android dev
[13:31:47] <wa5ted> looking into a few interesting ideas
[13:32:07] <Velveeta> dekiss2: as of jquery 1.9 i think, they removed jQuery.browser, maybe 1.10
[13:32:23] <Velveeta> but your syntax there isn't referencing jQuery.browser, it's referencing jQuery(browser)
[13:32:27] <grafi> wa5ted sure, why would you care though, its not like we're doing something wrong here :P
[13:32:37] <grafi> android dev, cool :P
[13:32:42] <wa5ted> no its like if i ask a question
[13:32:45] <grafi> i once installed the android ide
[13:32:47] <wa5ted> it may seem stupid to them
[13:32:53] <grafi> and then uninstalled it
[13:32:54] <wa5ted> grafi: its actually fun
[13:32:59] <wa5ted> once you get through all the complex shit
[13:33:13] <grafi> wa5ted lol about the stupid questions xD
[13:33:26] <dekiss2> lol this code has syntax error
[13:33:35] <dekiss2> its not mine :) didnt saw it lacks css :S
[13:33:40] <grafi> look at Velveeta he's asking stupid questions all the time
[13:33:45] <grafi> he doesnt care
[13:33:46] <grafi> :D
[13:33:49] <Velveeta> what's a stupid?
[13:33:51] <dekiss2> Velveeta it will output error if I use it?
[13:33:52] <tw2113> i miss jQuery.browser ~ very few people, ever
[13:34:01] <Velveeta> dekiss2: yes, depending on your jquery version
[13:34:05] <grafi> Velveeta: exactly :DD
[13:34:19] <Velveeta> there's a jquery migrate plugin you can use to track down all of the places you're using jquery.browser, so you can get them removed and do your checks properly
[13:34:32] <wa5ted> grafi: hahahaha
[13:34:44] <dekiss2> yep Uncaught ReferenceError: browser is not defined
[13:35:05] <wa5ted> grafi: its just about public face thats all
[13:35:06] <dekiss2> so is there replacement for this?
[13:35:15] <wa5ted> grafi: anyways, what say we get right back into our framework
[13:35:17] <grafi> i think you are being paranoid
[13:35:19] <Velveeta> yes, the recommended method is using feature detection, not browser detection
[13:35:25] <wa5ted> grafi: i have a right to be
[13:35:35] <Velveeta> don't check the user's browser version, check what their browser is capable of doing, and tailor your code to that instead
[13:35:36] <grafi> plus people are way too lazy to search you on irc logs
[13:35:41] <wa5ted> i knwo
[13:35:46] <grafi> nobody in hr even knows what that is
[13:35:47] <grafi> :P
[13:35:49] <wa5ted> but still doesnt hurt to be cautious
[13:35:53] <wa5ted> your not using your real name
[13:35:59] <wa5ted> niether is Velveeta
[13:36:02] <tw2113> HR knows stuff grafi ?
[13:36:06] <grafi> how would they even know what a stupid question is
[13:36:16] <wa5ted> well they could read
[13:36:17] <grafi> as long as you're not being an asshole
[13:36:24] <wa5ted> like the times i beg either you or Velveeta to help me
[13:36:29] <grafi> i dont see why you should hide
[13:36:30] <grafi> oô
[13:36:34] <Velveeta> i like to make him get on his knees first
[13:36:37] <Velveeta> and cry
[13:36:40] <wa5ted> hahahaha
[13:36:41] <dekiss2> I had mistake
[13:36:44] <dekiss2> it ok
[13:36:48] <Velveeta> and then i help, but i make him feel bad about it while i do it
[13:36:49] <dekiss2> its ok browser is ok for this ver
[13:36:54] <grafi> anyway, my point is pick another name
[13:36:58] <wa5ted> Velveeta: lol
[13:37:02] <grafi> shall i generate one for you?
[13:37:02] <grafi> ^^
[13:37:08] <dekiss2> Velveeta ok thanks
[13:37:08] <wa5ted> grafi: my previous nicks are terrible
[13:37:21] <Velveeta> dekiss2: no problem, but it's gonna bite you at some point when you eventually upgrade
[13:37:22] <wa5ted> brow_power_1, firechild22, devils08
[13:37:34] <Velveeta> you'd be wise to start migrating that code to the proper methods in the meantime
[13:37:37] <grafi> wa5ted Kwf2eOwMZ73NO0V622CV take this and treasure it as your own

[13:48:41] <sabotender> since i am mixing php and javascript I am not sure where to post this, since it is using JQuery, I think this channel seems the most appropriate: is this okay: $("login-process").click(function(){$.post("process-creds.php",{u: document.getElementById("username").value, p: " <?php echo password_hash($_POST['password'], PASSWORD_DEFAULT); "}, function () {foo}); }); ?>
[13:49:02] <grafi> sabotender dont do that
[13:49:07] <Velveeta> heheheh
[13:49:09] * sabotender sighs
[13:50:16] <sabotender> I am not sure how to use a PHP function along with JQUERY then :-( I am not sending that password in non-obfuscated form
[13:50:17] <Velveeta> sabotender: i'm not sure what your password_hash call is trying to do
[13:50:33] <sabotender> Velveeta: it basically hashes the password
[13:50:39] <Velveeta> why wouldn't you send the password in non-obfuscated form? just ssl the page
[13:50:45] <Velveeta> er the transaction
[13:50:59] <sabotender> my entire website is ssl, but I like to be extra safe
[13:51:06] <Velveeta> that's overly safe
[13:51:17] <Velveeta> anybody that can crack your ssl could also crack your password hash, i'm pretty sure
[13:51:49] <Velveeta> and php won't know anything about their password until it reaches the server, so referencing $_POST['password'] wouldn't return anything
[13:51:51] <grafi> im not even sure what that does oô
[13:52:15] <wa5ted> Velveeta: oh god has the gif giver returned
[13:52:35] <sabotender> hrm. are you sure it is safe to pass the password in the open if my site is ssl?
[13:52:47] <grafi> wa5ted https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/WLDwBzP.gif
[13:52:48] <Velveeta> that's what literally almost every single website in the world does
[13:52:52] <Velveeta> so yes, it's safe
[13:52:52] <sabotender> okay I guess you are right
[13:53:06] <grafi> Velveeta is one smart cheese
[13:53:07] <wa5ted>  grafi lol
[13:53:14] <Velveeta> that's why there's a shortage of me
[13:53:15] <sabotender> ...it does save me a bit of headache mixing php and javascript
[13:53:25] <wa5ted> grafi: but ya, i am looking really any where in the US preferably near San Jose

[13:53:57] <Velveeta> we got our block of velveeta for superbowl a couple weeks ago
[13:54:02] <Velveeta> before the shit hit the fan
[13:54:20] <sabotender> I hope you are adding the peppers. otherwise, it's no fun
[13:54:25] <Velveeta> with the velveeta shortage, my twitter account has blown up, because people don't bother to check that @Velveeta belongs to kraft…
[13:54:34] <Velveeta> incidentally, @Kraft doesn't belong to kraft either :D
[13:54:41] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/2nfvNL7.gif
[13:54:49] <grafi> who does it belong to?
[13:54:54] <Velveeta> another web guy in austin
[13:55:03] <sabotender> okay, I can talk about tasty tasty nachos all day, but I have to return to working on this website :-P
[13:55:04] <Velveeta> he works for wordpress or something, does QA stuff i believe
[13:55:15] <Velveeta> good luck sabotender
[13:55:19] <sabotender> danke
[13:55:19] <Velveeta> some pointers on mixing php and js
[13:55:21] <Ericx2x> hm e.preventDefault(); on a link is supposed to prevent the browser from going to the link?
[13:55:41] <Velveeta> use php to dump stuff to variables in js if you have to, and reference those vars in your js
[13:56:04] <Velveeta> try not to intermix php and js too much, as in creating entire functions that dump in php echo snippets and js stuff
[13:56:31] <grafi> amazing coincidinc
[13:56:52] <Velveeta> example, instead of something like this: function test () { alert('<?php echo myVar; ?>'); }, do this: function test () { var myVar = '<?php echo $myVar; ?>'; alert(myVar); }
[13:56:56] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/3a1pmqB.gif
[13:57:00] <grafi> best gif evar
[13:57:07] <Velveeta> it's much more readable and easy to figure out what the intended functionality is
[13:58:03] <Velveeta> grafi: nice
[13:58:53] <Ericx2x> Velveeta for some reason my links are not getting prevented
[13:58:59] <Ericx2x> does this have something to do with the document readY?
[13:59:15] <Velveeta> ericx2x: did you add the preventDefault calls to your click callbacks?
[13:59:38] <Ericx2x> yeah my code is this http://jsfiddle.net/aupwe/4/
[13:59:44] <grafi> Velveeta https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/s7O7asI.gif
[13:59:45] <grafi> :P
[14:00:09] <Velveeta> ericx2x: typically, the only time i see something not being prevented as it should, it's because there's an error being thrown somewhere
[14:00:16] <Velveeta> do you have an errors in your console?
[14:00:25] <grafi> works for me
[14:00:26] <grafi> oô
[14:00:39] <Velveeta> same here
[14:00:53] <Ericx2x> console as in firebug console?
[14:00:54] <Ericx2x> it's blank
[14:01:03] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/Gl7X5TL.gif
[14:01:03] <Velveeta> when you say your links are not getting prevented, do you mean the click handler is not being prevented, or do you mean your links are actually redirecting you somewhere?
[14:01:17] <Ericx2x> links are redirecting me somwerhe
[14:01:41] <Velveeta> hm, well, somebody else is gonna have to help you find the resolution to that for now, i gotta go pick up my kid from his mom's place
[14:01:59] <Ericx2x> ok thanks
[14:02:22] * grafi hides
[14:02:55] <sabotender> I am trying to understand this JQuery $.post() method, how does the remote script pass data back to the method?
[14:03:48] <Ericx2x> Can someone get this to work? http://jsfiddle.net/aupwe/6/
[14:03:50] <grafi> you pass a callback to post that gets called with the data recieved
[14:03:55] <sabotender> i'm looking at the w3schools example, and all i see is function(data,status){...}); it doesn't give me much information about
[14:04:30] <sabotender> so...I just use a regular $_POST?
[14:04:34] <grafi> Ericx2x fixed you syntax ... http://jsfiddle.net/aupwe/7/
[14:04:38] <wa5ted> grafi: so let me know whe nyou free up, we can ramp up progress on our framework
[14:04:59] <grafi> yeah we should really do that sometime :p
[14:05:10] <grafi> when are you expecting to start the intership? soonish?
[14:05:17] <grafi> or over summer?
[14:06:34] <grafi> sabotender what now?
[14:07:41] <sabotender> i don't even know how to return data from an AJAX call via php
[14:07:42] <sabotender> lol
[14:08:12] <grafi> why not?
[14:08:13] <grafi> :D
[14:08:15] <sabotender> I was trying figure out PHP's version of ASP's Response.Write
[14:08:32] <sabotender> grafi: this is my very first attempt at JQuery + AJAX
[14:08:43] <grafi> its really very simple
[14:08:44] <grafi> :x
[14:08:56] <sabotender> is it now? well spit it out! :-P
[14:09:40] <grafi> well what exactly
[14:09:46] <grafi> are you trying something specific
[14:09:58] <grafi> or just a general how does it work?
[14:10:04] <wa5ted> grafi: over the summer, starting in about april
[14:10:08] <wa5ted> trying to secure something now
[14:10:14] <wa5ted> im already late i think
[14:10:17] <sabotender> all i want to do is return true or false if the server fully validates the user
[14:10:27] <grafi> best of luck wa5ted
[14:10:42] <sabotender> so i can do stuff like show a popup about invalid username/password combination, or link the user to a new page
[14:10:44] <grafi> feel free to drop my name anywhere you like
[14:10:52] <grafi> im sure nobody knows who I am
[14:11:13] <grafi> sabotender when trying to log in?
[14:11:16] <grafi> cool
[14:11:40] <sabotender> grafi: my goal is to reduce full page loads to a minimum
[14:12:03] <grafi> admirable
[14:12:13] <sabotender> I always thought linking a page to a 'validate.php' script just to link back if its wrong
[14:12:18] <sabotender> was dumb
[14:12:51] <sabotender> heh maybe I should ask in #php
[14:14:31] <grafi> never a good idea :D
[14:14:43] <grafi> ok so lets say you have a form
[14:14:48] <grafi> and want to login
[14:15:09] <sabotender> I can only assume that ajax is looking for live text, like an echo
[14:16:00] <wa5ted> grafi: thank
[14:16:05] <wa5ted> thanks
[14:16:29] <grafi> in the php page?
[14:16:37] <sabotender> yeah
[14:16:49] <grafi> sure, you get whatever the request sees
[14:16:59] <grafi> so it could also be a full html page
[14:16:59] <sabotender> I'll bet its a darn echo
[14:16:59] <sabotender> haha
[14:17:08] <grafi> or it could be json
[14:17:24] <sabotender> no more syntax, please
[14:17:34] <sabotender> my head hurts from all this new syntax
[14:17:35] <sabotender> lol
[14:18:14] <sabotender> socket.io, javascript, php, node.js, bootstrap, jquery
[14:18:56] <grafi> im writing something up that hopefully helps you :P
[14:22:59] <sabotender> oh sweet
[14:23:31] <wa5ted> grafi: hahaha sabotender is having overload
[14:23:38] <wa5ted> just another at #jquery
[14:23:39] <sabotender> looks like the data is returned in the form of a function parameter
[14:23:42] <wa5ted> getting shit done
[14:23:53] <Ericx2x> Can someone type 1 in the zipcode box and get hopkin to not redirect? http://jsfiddle.net/GeN4z/1/
[14:23:59] <grafi> hm doesnt look nice but whatever oô
[14:24:00] <sabotender> wa5ted: I'm happy someone understands my woes :-P
[14:24:06] <grafi> sabotender https://gist.github.com/mstoppert/24a5e1269e3e2f0211cd
[14:24:17] <grafi> and dont quote me on that
[14:24:18] <grafi> :D
[14:26:05] <sabotender> grafi: I could never understand the concept of 'this'. is it okay if I use document.getElementByID?
[14:26:40] <grafi> $(this) in jquery stuff is mostly just the element the handler was called on
[14:26:47] <grafi> but whatever floats your boat
[14:26:54] <sabotender> oops, it got cut off. document.getElementByID("foo").value
[14:27:17] <sabotender> okay good, because it makes much more sense when I can refer to  it directly
[14:27:23] <grafi> well you are
[14:27:24] <wa5ted> $(this) is esp useful when you want to reference current var, esp in a foroop
[14:27:24] <sabotender> (more sense to me)
[14:27:27] <wa5ted> *for loop
[14:27:51] <wa5ted> lol sabotender you can mix jquery and js
[14:27:55] <grafi> i would suggest getting used to that, but okay
[14:27:56] <grafi> :P
[14:28:05] <wa5ted> but why would you ever go back to js complex referencing
[14:28:10] <wa5ted> jquery so much easier
[14:28:14] <sabotender> eventually. but for now I just want to get done with this :-P
[14:28:39] <grafi> i wonder why the syntax highlighting does not work oô
[14:28:52] <sabotender> why are you using $.ajax instead of $.post?
[14:29:36] <sabotender> it doesn't matter to me of the method, I am just curious
[14:30:36] <grafi> $.post basically just is a shortcut for $.ajax
[14:30:41] <sabotender> the $.ajax method appears much better as it has clear parameters such as url, type, and data and especially success
[14:30:45] <grafi> im just used to using $.ajax ;)
[14:30:55] * sabotender kicks $.post out the window
[14:31:14] <sabotender> I don't like obfuscation :-P
[14:31:14] <grafi> yeah in $.post you have to know which order to put the arguments in
[14:32:27] <wa5ted> grafi: wouldnt it be easier to $.get
[14:32:28] <grafi> sabotender http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=$.post thats what post looks like
[14:32:42] <wa5ted> unless of course sabotender is sending secure data
[14:32:43] <sabotender> grafi: don
[14:32:53] <sabotender> 't dissuade me from using $.ajax :-P
[14:33:08] <sabotender> wa5ted: my enture website operates under ssl
[14:33:11] <grafi> wa5ted well pws
[14:33:21] <sabotender> apparently, I don't need to hash the password passed
[14:33:29] <grafi> wa5ted also i think to post stuff to the server one shouldnt use get
[14:33:39] <grafi> proper use of http verbs and such
[14:33:39] <grafi> :P
[14:33:51] <wa5ted> true i gues
[14:34:00] <wa5ted> if its unsecure i rather send via get
[14:34:01] <sabotender> I suxor at using the proper term for things
[14:34:02] <wa5ted> speed and all
[14:34:04] <grafi> sabotender when you submit a form its not hashed anyway ;)
[14:34:26] <grafi> why is get faster than post?
[14:34:26] <grafi> oô
[14:35:38] <wa5ted> cause its unsecure
[14:35:41] <wa5ted> thats why
[14:36:43] <grafi> erm
[14:36:45] <grafi> what?
[14:37:02] <grafi> im beginning to think its good you changed your nick :D
[14:39:32] <grafi> syntax highlighting, finally

[15:28:22] <wa5ted> *click
[15:28:32] <grafi> are you being serious?
[15:28:33] <grafi> oô
[15:28:39] <guilund> jquery used to work very well back in time
[15:28:43] <grafi> you know how .on works dont you?
[15:29:14] <guilund> let me see the version of rails jquery
[15:29:25] <guilund> i think its slightly different
[15:30:03] <guilund> 1.10.1
[15:30:21] <guilund> sorry 1.10.2
[15:31:17] <guilund> it dont raise any errors
[15:32:00] <wa5ted> well ya
[15:32:10] <wa5ted> grafi: i just never came accross that sort of setup
[15:32:13] <wa5ted> well wait a sec.....
[15:32:21] <wa5ted> isnt that used for dynamically created elements
[15:32:24] <grafi> simple delegation
[15:32:26] <wa5ted> wheich require handlers
[15:32:27] <grafi> ._.
[15:32:33] <wa5ted> ??
[15:32:44] <grafi> $('#parent').on('click', '.element', function() {})
[15:32:58] * wa5ted is gonna shut his mouth before he sounds stupider than grafi thinks
[15:32:59] <grafi> everything there
[15:33:03] <grafi> anything missing?
[15:33:04] <guilund> im using it for dinamically created elements
[15:33:12] <guilund> but i thik you can use it always
[15:33:17] <wa5ted> guilund: i thought so
[15:33:17] <grafi> thats quite alright guilund
[15:33:37] * grafi slaps some sense into wa5ted
[15:33:38] <grafi> :P
[15:33:42] <guilund> grafi: yeah, i mean, the rails version is the same of jsfiddle
[15:33:53] <guilund> the jquery rails
[15:34:07] <wa5ted> grafi: lol
[15:34:23] <grafi> oh i didnt even see the fiddle you posted :x but it should work :P
[15:34:37] <wa5ted> whos not on the ball now grafi ? :P
[15:34:47] <grafi> where is the code inside the page guilund
[15:34:57] * wa5ted looking smug
[15:35:08] <grafi> i was distracted educating you about your lack of knowledge :P
[15:35:16] <guilund> grafi: i dont know what you mean... ?
[15:35:51] <wa5ted> grafi: hahaha
[15:35:53] <grafi> is the js included at the bottom, wrapped in a document ready something?
[15:36:08] <wa5ted> grafi: i may not know the technical terms but what i know I know fucking well
[15:36:38] <grafi> well you did see code though and had to ask :)
[15:36:40] <grafi> haha
[15:36:41] <grafi> :P
[15:36:47] <grafi> no technical terms there :]
[15:37:12] <Algorithm> Hi, can someone help me adjust the span text without adjusting the size? Whenever I change the text using the text or html method the font size changes. Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/LcU7h/1/
[15:37:49] <guilund> grafi: it works if i use a #id instead of .class
[15:37:56] <guilund> grafi: its loading...
[15:37:57] <Algorithm> oops, I guess I was off there. It looks the same. I'm having an issue in jquery mobile though
[15:38:27] <grafi> guilund sounds strange, dont know what to say
[15:38:34] <grafi> everything spelled correctly?
[15:38:54] <guilund> yeah...
[15:38:58] <grafi> in the html actually a class you set not just the id
[15:39:08] <Algorithm> When I adjust the text it screws up the margins. http://jsfiddle.net/LcU7h/2/
[15:39:13] <grafi> that might explain why it works with id :D
[15:39:31] <guilund> grafi: sorry, english is not my native language
[15:39:49] <guilund> grafi what do you mean in the html actually a class you set not just the id
[15:40:17] <grafi> well does the element actually have a class of element or whatever you use in the code
[15:40:26] <grafi> in other words, is the html correct
[15:40:26] <guilund> wait
[15:40:28] <grafi> :p
[15:40:36] <guilund> the #parent need to be the immediate parent?
[15:40:49] <grafi> hm no i dont think so
[15:41:02] <grafi> the event bubbles up all the way to the document
[15:41:46] <guilund> yeah...
[15:41:59] <guilund> the html is correct...
[15:42:24] <grafi> hm
[15:42:35] <grafi> then im fresh out of ideas
[15:42:35] <grafi> :P
[15:43:30] <guilund> thanks grafi, it should be a bug
[16:01:06] <wa5ted> wait what i miss
[16:01:09] <wa5ted> nooooooooo
[16:01:26] <wa5ted> i didnt get to make grafi's life a living hell with someone elses question
[16:01:41] <wa5ted> grafi: damn you grafi and your speed at which you solve tohers problems
[16:01:46] <wa5ted> *others
[16:01:49] <grafi> what
[16:01:50] <grafi> oô
[16:01:56] <grafi> did i miss something?
[16:04:20] <wa5ted> nvm
[16:04:24] <wa5ted> cheasy joke
[16:04:42] <wa5ted> oh Velveeta and I (i dont think you were there) made you the official #jquery gif giver
[16:06:17] <grafi> where do I get my gift card?
[16:08:35] <wa5ted> hahaha
[16:08:48] <wa5ted> Velveeta: is the problem/query solving guru
[16:08:53] <wa5ted> and I am the joke killer
[16:08:55] <wa5ted> i think
[16:08:57] <wa5ted> grafi: ^
[16:09:12] <grafi> joker is already dead
[16:11:55] <wa5ted> hahahaha
[16:14:54] <wa5ted> grafi: so whats your project on
[16:14:59] <wa5ted> the one that your busy n
[16:15:11] <wa5ted> and the one i keep disturbing you from :P
[16:17:09] <Ericx2x> Can someone get this working? http://jsfiddle.net/GeN4z/4/
[16:17:53] <grafi> only the next youtube wa5ted
[16:17:54] <grafi> :P
[16:18:08] <wa5ted> ohhh really?
[16:18:11] <wa5ted> any specifics
[16:20:37] <JackBauer24> Ericx2x: use $.on to attach events to dynamically created DOM elements
[16:20:59] <grafi> isnt youtube specific enough :D
[16:22:37] <Velveeta> i never made anybody the official jquery gif giver, you named him that yourself.. i'm quite proud of my own gif collection, and would never give up that title willingly ;)
[16:22:51] <grafi> Velveeta :D
[16:23:03] <grafi> gif-off?
[16:23:04] <grafi> :D
[16:23:21] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/DMpDaIc.gif
[16:23:34] <Velveeta> also, ericx2x: this is the 2nd time i've seen you ask something like that… we're not here to do peoples' work for them, we appreciate people asking in a bit more constructive, learning way, rather than just "can someone get this working? <link, no explanation>"
[16:25:08] <Velveeta> grafi: do you know what that box is? it's pretty awesome :)
[16:25:16] <Velveeta> if you have money to burn on toys like that anyway
[16:25:38] <grafi> just something with a gyroskope in it?
[16:25:41] <grafi> something like that
[16:25:45] <Velveeta> it can stand itself up from a sitting position, either on an edge or a corner, and can walk itself across surfaces even
[16:26:12] <Velveeta> yeah, that's part of it, it also has internal motors that it uses to build up energy, and then stops them suddenly to transfer that into motion
[16:26:20] <Velveeta> that's how it stands itself up from a resting position
[16:26:37] <Velveeta> here you go: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y
[16:26:49] <grafi> :)
[16:27:44] <grafi> hm i think ive seen something like that
[16:27:49] <grafi> smaller and with magnets
[16:27:57] <grafi> can assemble itself into structures
[16:28:00] <grafi> pretty cool
[16:28:46] <Velveeta> oh yeah i've seen something like what you're talking about i think
[16:29:51] <Velveeta> this one maybe? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOqjFa4RskA#t=45 …though the one i was thinking of is different than this
[16:30:11] <grafi> hm yeah i think thats it
[16:30:24] <grafi> the blocks look a bit different
[16:30:38] <grafi> but they behave exactly like the ones i saw
[16:30:39] <grafi> :P
[16:32:57] <Velveeta> these are the ones i was thinking of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3ernrkZ91E
[16:33:45] <grafi> immediately reminds one of the nanorobots species from stargate
[16:33:50] <grafi> whatever they were called
[16:33:51] <grafi> :x
[16:33:57] <Velveeta> i never did watch that series
[16:34:03] <Velveeta> but i often heard good things about it
[16:34:18] <Velveeta> this video strikes me as the most probably path forward to skynet :D
[16:34:20] <grafi> the replicators
[16:34:21] <grafi> :P
[16:35:34] <grafi> hm sherlock is a bit over the top this season
[16:35:35] <grafi> oô
[16:35:38] <grafi> im so confused
[16:38:41] <Ericx2x> JackBauer24 I don't quite see the solution you're suggesting
[16:40:14] <coldhead> no spoilers, grafi
[16:40:29] <grafi> everybody dies coldhead
[16:40:31] <grafi> happy?
[16:40:49] <JackBauer24> Ericx2x: you create #hopkin link dynamically using JS - previously initiated event handlers to that element won't be attached, because that element didn't exist then
[16:40:55] <coldhead> quite the opposite
[16:41:09] <grafi> so not a game of thrones fan then eh?
[16:41:09] <grafi> ^^
[16:41:19] <JackBauer24> that's what what $.on is for - it attaches event to existing elements and to the elements created in future
[16:41:54] <Ericx2x> ok that makes me understand a bit better
[16:42:01] <Ericx2x> i'm not used to $.on though
[16:43:47] <Ericx2x> Do I simply attach it like this?
[16:43:48] <Ericx2x> $( "#hopkin" ).on( "click", function() {
[16:45:42] <JackBauer24> Ericx2x: $(document).on("click", "#hopkin", function(){
[16:52:26] <Velveeta> ericx2x: to help explain that a bit, when you use a selector like $('#hopkin'), jquery has to be able to find that element in the document in order to bind a listener to it… if it doesn't exist at that time, it won't find anything to bind to, and nothing will happen, but...
[16:53:04] <Velveeta> if you bind to the document itself, and tell it to use #hopkin as the selector to trigger on, then the document will just listen for clicks in general, and if any of those happen to be *on* an element w/ #hopkin as its selector, it will trigger that callback
[16:54:00] <Velveeta> so that means you can bind your listener to the document before #hopkin exists, and it just won't do anything until it does exist, and when it does exist, and you click on it, the document will receive that click through the event bubbling up through the dom, and see that it was clicked on #hopkin, and fire that event handler, even though it didn't exist at the time that listener was bound to the document
[16:57:39] <wa5ted> grafi: game of thrones new season today or in march
[16:57:46] <wa5ted> today meaning 12 jan
[16:57:58] <grafi> what
[16:58:01] <grafi> april

[17:00:51] <wa5ted> okay

[17:56:25] <relipse> someone who loves javascript join my game http://jkinsman.com:9999/4playerchess/#gid=RELIPSEGAME
[17:56:31] <relipse> all js all node baby
[17:59:58] <coldhead> relipse: this certainly solves the problem of chess "not being hard enough"
[18:00:05] <relipse> what you mean?
[18:00:14] <coldhead> i mean chess is already hard!
[18:00:24] <coldhead> 4 people? THAT'S UNPOSSIBLE!
[18:00:34] <snover> what if someone that hates javascript joined your game by accident
[18:00:37] <snover> or intentionally
[18:00:54] <snover> i guess what i am saying is, i fucking hate javascript
[18:00:56] <snover> hi coldhead
[18:01:09] <coldhead> hi babe, i fucking hate javascript too
[18:06:27] <snover> so what are we going to do with all this hate
[18:10:20] <Mamoru> Cool, 4 player chess. I played 3-player chess once. It was fun, I beat the national champion & his father. :D I guess in that case not knowing standard settings by hard is a plus
[18:28:04] <igcewieling> if it wasn't for jquery I'd hate javascript too.  As it is I only have a mild dislike for it. 8-|
[18:39:57] <snover> since jquery does literally nothing to make *javascript* easier to use, i think your hate is misplaced
[18:40:51] <wa5ted> snover: well its replacing actual js with easier calls etc. like selectors and also provides easier plugin use and stuff
[18:41:10] <wa5ted> tbh i am guilty i learned jquery first and had appreciation for js from jquery
[18:41:13] <snover> coldhead: help
[18:43:13] <lenswipee> snover i think you got it backwards
[18:44:21] <snover> um, nope
[18:45:01] <snover> jquery is a dom and ajax helper library, neither of which are part of javascript
[18:45:44] <lenswipee> snover: no, jquery is a js library.
[18:47:17] <snover> coldhead: they’re touching me. they are unwashed.
[18:47:32] <hugo_moss> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
[18:47:39] <s5fs> relipse: haha still with the 4 player chess, eh? slow in #Node.js tonight?
[18:47:53] <snover> thanks, guys, for telling a former jquery core committer what jquery is
[18:47:58] * lenswipee thinks snover is trolling
[18:48:05] <hugo_moss> you're both right
[18:48:26] <hugo_moss> its a javascript library that aids in dom manipulation and ajax
[18:48:50] <snover> i’m only trolling insofar that i corrected something that someone said that was not technically correct. and as we all know, technical correctness is the best kind of correctness.
[18:48:58] <s5fs> ^^ concur
[18:49:12] <hugo_moss> agreed
[18:53:26] <s5fs> snover: no love for the maintainers eh? haha
[18:53:38] <s5fs> snover: sorry, "ex" maintainers
[18:54:07] <snover> s5fs: the severance package is not great.
[18:55:22] <s5fs> snover: whatever man, you're still listed as being in the ot-crew github org haha
[18:55:50] <snover> just today i added a wat. let’s not say i am buried yet!
[18:56:14] <s5fs> gogogo!

[20:14:16] <Fishbowne> Hello.
[20:15:10] <Fishbowne> anyone know how to dynamically add Jquery calls for dynamic Html ?
[20:16:18] <grafi> dynamically
[20:16:26] <Fishbowne> sure.
[20:17:04] <Fishbowne> im creating some HTML and want to add jquery.click functions
[20:17:14] <Fishbowne> HTML is being generated on the fly... dynamically.
[20:18:52] <apineda> .on()
[21:07:21] <Fishbowne> yep... on worked.
[21:07:27] <Fishbowne> thanks jquery gods.
[21:24:01] <felixjet_> if i have 5 links inside a div
[21:24:08] <felixjet_> how i do know which one is clicked?
[21:24:26] <felixjet_> something like... $('div a').click(
[21:24:33] <felixjet_> but how i do get which position was clicked?
[21:25:13] <tw2113> $(this)
[21:25:59] <h0lyalg0rithm> tw2113 i think he wants the position of a not the a itself
[21:26:36] <tw2113> what if he just needs whichever was clicked, and he reasoned that knowing the index of the divs was the way to determine that
[21:27:11] <h0lyalg0rithm> <felixjet_> What do you want to achieve
[21:27:28] <felixjet_> nvm, i got it by using $(this).parent().children().index(this)
[21:28:10] <tw2113> sounds like the long way, to be honest
[21:28:26] <tw2113> i wonder if $(this).index() would work, just a thought
[21:28:36] <tw2113> no guarantee
[21:28:52] <felixjet_> lol it does
[21:28:58] <felixjet_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/602886/how-do-i-get-the-position-of-a-child-element
[21:29:30] <felixjet_> why this guy goes the long way then?
[21:29:31] <felixjet_> xD
[21:29:40] <tw2113> because he didn't know at the time either?
[21:30:14] <felixjet_> and... since im using css, direction: rtl
[21:30:21] <felixjet_> how i can convert 5 to 1
[21:30:24] <felixjet_> 4 to 2
[21:30:29] <felixjet_> 2 to 4
[21:30:29] <felixjet_> etc
[21:30:35] <felixjet_> any simply maths?
[21:30:40] <felixjet_> simple*
[21:36:34] <Fishbowne> anyone up ?
[21:36:48] <Fishbowne> is there a way to test if html is loaded in an .html() call ?
[21:36:59] <Fishbowne> so i can fade in smoothly.
[21:37:02] <Fishbowne> ?
[21:37:51] <tw2113> put the jquery stuff at the end of the file
[21:38:03] <Fishbowne> huh ?
[21:38:11] <Fishbowne> of the html ?
[21:38:20] <tw2113> by the time the loading of the page gets to your jquery code, the rest will already have been loaded
[21:38:30] <tw2113> right before the </body> tag
[21:39:17] <Fishbowne> well my content is loading dyncamilcally though
[21:39:39] <tw2113> hmm, no idea then
[21:41:41] <Fishbowne>  hmmm
[21:44:23] <ezio> i have a isText selector
[21:44:24] <ezio> working
[21:44:39] <ezio> $(serverinfo).find('computers computer name:textIs(DC1)');
[21:44:50] <ezio> that works but $(serverinfo).find('computers computer name:textIs(DC1):parent');
[21:45:00] <ezio> doesn't get me up to parent it just returns the same element
[22:16:58] <s3shs> I've got a funny one.  I have a $.post to transmit some data from the server.  The $.post returns nothing to any of its callbacks the first time after the page loads.  But works every time after that.  I've got .always, .fail and .done on my $.post retval.  I'm out of ideas.
[23:13:48] <kakusu> anyone alive?
[23:15:43] <Amirh> hi
[23:15:48] <Amirh> paste event doesn't work
[23:15:54] <Amirh> what could be the problem?
[23:27:36] <Cork> Amirh: the browser might not support it, or it might be disabled
[23:28:24] <Amirh> Cork: we have 3 computers, 2 browsers, 2 OS
[23:28:32] <Amirh> the funny thing
[23:28:45] <Amirh> is the code you gave me lastnight works on fiddle
[23:29:00] <Amirh> but when I apply it to my code it doesn't work
[23:29:14] <Amirh> even our senior developer faced the same.
[23:30:25] <Cork> Amirh: there is a few reasons the code could cause it too, but it is a guessing game without seeing the problem
[23:30:59] <Amirh> give me your hints then please, Cork
[23:31:32] <Cork> check so no other event is canceling the event before your event handler gets it for one
[23:31:42] <Cork> make sure you don't get any error in the page
[23:32:03] <Cork> make sure you actually find the element when you try to bind the event listener
[23:32:10] <Cork> and so on
[23:32:28] <Cork> like i said, just pot shots
[23:32:39] <Amirh> event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[23:32:42] <Amirh> only this one.
[23:32:53] <Cork> well...
[23:33:02] <Cork> that isn't an error
[23:33:05] <Cork> just a warning
[23:33:09] <Cork> though you should fix that too
[23:33:27] <Amirh> and another error which said an image didn't exist
[23:33:32] <Amirh> nothing more
[23:33:51] <Cork> then you will have to try to reproduce the problem in a stand alone file
[23:33:59] <Cork> and then remove parts until you get the code working
[23:34:07] <Cork> and through that find what causes it
[23:34:12] <Amirh> oh...
[23:34:23] <Amirh> I have to talk about it with the senior guy,
[23:34:43] <Cork> or provide something one can look at
[23:35:07] <Cork> pot shooting and actually finding the cause is quite slim
[23:35:42] <Amirh> let me
[23:37:02] <Amirh> Cork: http://www.pastebin.ca/2535439
[23:37:06] <Amirh> only keyup works
[23:37:16] <Cork> that is a code dump
[23:37:25] <Cork> the code needs to work
[23:37:34] <Cork> jsfiddle or jsbin is two good places
[23:38:14] <Amirh> Cork: well then I have to upload the crawler somewhere
[23:38:16] <Cork> though i can warn about one thing
[23:38:19] <Amirh> which I can't at this moment
[23:38:36] <Cork> binding event handlers in event handlers is risky
[23:38:52] <Cork> and can be cause of bug cause of the complexity in the flow

[23:48:17] <funhouse> Hi guys, just wondering, when you doing OOP, do you store selectors within the object to cache them there?
[23:48:41] <Cork> funhouse: depends on the needs of the page
[23:49:13] <Cork> storing a selector just for the sake of oop is doing it for the wrong reason
[23:49:47] <Cork> also think about if the target might be dynamically changed later on
[23:49:54] <Cork> in those cases you don't want to cache the selector
[23:50:32] <funhouse> Cork: I use it in multiple  functions, the certain selector that is/
[23:51:27] <Cork> well depending on how things stick together you might either pass it in to each function; store the selector string
[23:51:31] <Cork> or store the results
[23:51:40] <Cork> what is the best solution depends
[23:52:29] <funhouse> Cork: ok got it thank you for the help
[23:59:35] <shafox> I am stuck with this please do let me know whats i am doing wrong. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21086345/emberjs-authentication-session-not-working
