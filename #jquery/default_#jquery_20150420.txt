[00:00:12] <TheHackOps> I would use delegates on the parent except there is no parent
[00:00:19] <TheHackOps> and i have no control over how its rendered
[00:00:38] <TheHackOps> Each button has a class and a unique div id
[00:01:03] <TheHackOps> I need to be able to register a click event on each one of those buttons. i use data-id to store the id as well if that helps
[00:21:57] <hollusion> TheHackOps: $('body').on('click', '.open-dialog', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).dialog(); });
[00:22:28] <TheHackOps> hollusion, ty sir
[00:22:40] <hollusion> will open an empty dialog though
[00:23:04] <hollusion> works with each element that hast the .open-dialog class

[00:27:31] <hollusion> Kartagis: what is your goal? you want to debug? see it in console?
[00:28:20] <Kartagis> hollusion: just print
[00:31:07] <hollusion> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/76t9buag/1/
[00:31:26] <hollusion> output can be seen in dev console (usually F12)
[01:01:47] <Mrkus> hello, i have a button that has onClick="setAvailable()" and I need to click it TWICE in order to execute the setAvailable() function
[01:01:49] <Mrkus> ???
[01:02:20] <Cork> Mrkus: most likely it is something inside the setAvailable function causing that
[01:02:33] <Cork> Mrkus: also don't use event atteributes, use event listeners instead
[01:05:52] <Mrkus> Cork: i'm new with jquery can you point me to example how would i use event listener in this case. by clicking on button
[01:06:13] <Cork> ?api on
[01:06:13] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:09:06] <hollusion> what is a good way to detect whether an object is a jquery-tooltip?
[01:09:38] <Cork> hollusion: jquery tooltip isn't an object
[01:09:55] <hollusion> whether an object got a .tooltip()
[01:10:06] <Cork> all jquery objects does
[01:10:20] <Cork> you could test if the function has been ran on the element
[01:10:29] <hollusion> exactly what im looking for
[01:10:33] <Cork> but it isn't a separate object
[01:10:45] <hollusion> true
[01:11:26] <hollusion> i want to check if a jq object has an active .tooltip()
[01:11:36] <Cork> you could check for data('ui-tooltip-title')
[01:18:43] <PCatinean> Hey guys, I made a delay function using this: http://hastebin.com/iwavaluvaj.js the problem  is that the source element it comes from can be differnet and then I don't want it to be delayed for both
[01:19:20] <PCatinean> Not sure if it makes sense, I use this to a function that is triggered by a onchange event which can come from different sources, I want the delay to apply only from one source
[01:21:17] <hollusion> shouldnt $(el).data(); print all data attribute values when run in dev console?
[01:21:22] <Cork> PCatinean: there is too little context to answer that question
[01:21:40] <Cork> hollusion: it should give you an object with the values yes
[01:21:58] <Cork> hollusion: note though .attr doesn't update that list after .data has been ran the first time
[01:22:06] <Cork> only .data will
[01:22:12] <Cork> (cache(
[01:22:14] <Cork> *)
[01:22:36] <PCatinean> Cork, http://hastebin.com/ofuhetucaj.coffee
[01:22:51] <PCatinean> basically i've delayed the body of that function using the click watch I've pasted before
[01:23:11] <hollusion> Cork: i am using tooltip() without setting a title attrbute and runnin .data() in console returns an empty object
[01:23:23] <PCatinean> the issue is that the onchange is placed on input.js_quantity and there are multiple instances in the dom
[01:23:28] <Cork> hollusion: ah...
[01:23:36] <Cork> hollusion: you might not be able to detect it then
[01:23:50] <PCatinean> and if somebody updates two elements (triggers onchange) in less than half a second (the delay time)
[01:23:54] <PCatinean> it just updates the last one
[01:24:00] <PCatinean> was that more specific?
[01:24:02] <Cork> hollusion: .tooltip is normally registered on a parent, and not the element with the title directly
[01:25:46] <PCatinean> Cork, I would basically need a way to trace the source of the event and only delay if it's the same or something similar
[01:25:54] <PCatinean> is that possible or...
[01:25:58] <Cork> no
[01:26:04] <PCatinean> bummer...
[01:26:18] <hollusion> Cork:  thank you
[01:26:20] <Cork> what you could do is make a global wrapper for the funciton you have
[01:26:27] <Cork> so the function only have one timeout
[01:26:35] <Cork> and check if the timer is active
[01:26:49] <Cork> but the way you have it right now there isn't a way to handle separate events
[01:27:19] <hollusion> Cork: .data() returns Object { uiTooltip={...}} so should i check if ($(el).data() instanceof uiTooltip) ?
[01:27:31] <Cork> no
[01:27:39] <PCatinean> What do you mean so it will only have on timeout, isn't that the case now?
[01:27:47] <Cork> hollusion: .data('uiTooltip') !== undefined
[01:28:58] <hollusion> .find(':data(uiTooltip)') will this also work?
[01:29:34] <hollusion> i mean is this another correct way to find objects with a tooltip
[01:30:42] <hollusion> ok i should just test and ask later, it works
[01:31:02] <Cork> hollusion: no, there isn't any :data() selector
[01:31:16] <Cork> (as far as i know)
[01:32:29] <hollusion> Cork: https://api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/
[01:32:46] <Cork> ah, jquery ui
[01:32:51] <Cork> (that isn't part of core)
[01:33:22] <Cork> so if you ever work without jquery ui you need to be careful of that
[01:34:37] <hollusion> i see, thank you for the advice
[01:38:46] <Lebbe> that sounds kinda scary. if you drop jquery ui you have a bunch of selectors who stops working?
[01:48:30] <Cork> Lebbe: yes
[01:51:14] <toomus> Hi. How to add element to div, but after first element?
[01:51:26] <Lebbe> should not $('[data-tooltip]') work?
[01:51:45] <Lebbe> should not $('[data-uiTooltip]') work?
[01:52:22] <zono> anyone here use linters with vim?
[01:52:30] <Lebbe> toomus: $('find div').children().first().insertAfter('what you want to add');
[01:52:37] <hollusion> Lebbe: that would look for the attribute but i dont think that the attribute is bound to be existant if you use .data()
[01:53:26] <Lebbe> hollusion: correct! I didn't think of that. you can set it as a property of course
[01:53:41] <hollusion> $('element').data('foo', 'bar').attr('data-foo'); i dont think that this works in all cases
[01:53:44] <Cork> ?api after @ toomus

[01:54:22] <Cork> Lebbe: you reverted the command
[01:54:42] <Cork> insertAfter insterts the thing on the left after the selector you give it
[01:54:53] <hollusion> $('.class1, .class2', '#id') <-- wasn't this the same as $('#d').find('.class1, .class2') ? can't find the documentation
[01:55:08] <Cork> hollusion: no
[01:55:22] <Cork> $('.class1, .class2', $('#id')) is though
[01:55:36] <Cork> or rather it gets forwarded to the later

[01:59:45] <Cork> toomus: $(target).after(newContent)
[01:59:52] <Cork> insertAfter does the otherway around
[02:00:06] <Cork> $(newContent).insertAfter('target')
[02:00:41] <Cork> (personally i prefer to use the former, cause that is the order of how things work in the dom)
[02:01:17] <Lebbe> ah yes i got that wrong
[02:01:19] <Cork> toomus: also note, that if you select elements in the dom you need to .clone() them before inserting them again
[02:01:24] <Cork> or they will be MOVED instead
[02:01:51] <lamppid> hi how i can simulate mousewheel or DOMMouseScrool event ?
[02:02:14] <toomus> Cork: I have to refashion other elements after insert because they have position absolute
[02:02:16] <Cork> lamppid: you can't simulate the native effect, but you can fake the event for js
[02:02:23] <Cork> lamppid: with the .trigger function
[02:02:29] <Cork> ?api trigger @ lamppid

[02:04:20] <Cork> {originalEvent.wheeldelta: 1} isn't a valid object
[02:04:29] <Cork> {originalEvent: {wheeldelta: 1 }}
[02:04:42] <lamppid> oops need to try now
[02:13:33] <kschlesselmann> Hi. I'd like to update my site if my database has changed. Is there some way to notify the site or would you normally poll for changes every x seconds?
[02:14:23] <Cork> kschlesselmann: depends on your packend
[02:14:26] <Cork> *backend
[02:14:38] <Cork> you could push the information through websocket
[02:14:48] <Cork> but php for example has a hard time handling websocket
[02:15:08] <kschlesselmann> Cork: I don't think so.
[02:15:10] <Cork> and in those cases you prob want to use a puller/longpuller
[02:15:36] <kschlesselmann> OK … then I want to use a pull stretegy
[02:15:39] <kschlesselmann> strategy
[02:15:42] <kschlesselmann> Thanks :-)
[02:16:24] <Cork> there is also server sent events
[02:16:35] <Cork> ?mdn server events
[02:16:35] <b-ot> Cork: Online and offline events | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Online_and_offline_events
[02:16:41] <Cork> uh... no
[02:16:44] <Cork> ?mdn server-sent events
[02:16:45] <b-ot> Cork: Server-sent events | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events
[02:17:34] <kschlesselmann> Hm … I'll see about that. In general: How would you update table rows that are pulled?Right now I inject them into an invisible div and then modify the dom tp publish them to the actual table. What do you think about that?
[02:22:10] <Cork> kschlesselmann: you should definitely not inject them into the page twice
[02:22:34] <kschlesselmann> Cork: I'd delete the invisible ones afterwards
[02:22:38] <kschlesselmann> what would you suggest?
[02:22:46] <Cork> kschlesselmann: just load them with $.ajax or $.get then var dom =$($.parseHTML(data))
[02:22:51] <Cork> and then modify the elements there
[02:22:59] <Cork> then inject it where it should be
[02:23:21] <Cork> kschlesselmann: ya, but every time you modify the elements in the in page element you risk triggering reflow
[02:23:30] <Cork> and just the act of adding it to the page causes reflow
[02:23:37] <Cork> so you definitely don't want to do that
[02:23:53] <kschlesselmann> Cork: This would buffer the resulting html in $data? this would work fine too
[02:24:09] <Cork> kschlesselmann: no, not buffle
[02:24:24] <Cork> it would parse the html into a dom fragment (dom elements)
[02:25:39] <kschlesselmann> Hm … I can't follow. Right now my workflow is something like -> php generates html -> js pull -> php generates some updated html -> now I need to switch the updated <tr>s  with the current ones
[02:26:17] <Cork> kschlesselmann: if that is all you want why do you need to inject it twice?
[02:26:33] <Cork> just do $('target').replaceWith(newHTML);
[02:26:48] <kschlesselmann> Cork: I just need it because my JS is so bad :-)
[02:27:13] <Cork> well... you're throwing performance down the drain...
[02:27:28] <kschlesselmann> Well, the updated html will contain a lot of <tr> with ids. I just have to replace those <tr>s and not the not changed ones
[02:27:51] <kschlesselmann> So i definetly have to iterate over the result of the updated html output
[02:28:05] <Cork> not sure i see why, but what ever
[02:29:20] <kschlesselmann> Cork: I got a table with 10 rows. Now my update gives me html containing 3 rows that have changed. I can't simply replace something … I'd have to to something like "for (row in result) replace(row)"
[02:29:40] <Cork> kschlesselmann: sure you can
[02:30:34] <Cork> $.get(url).done(function(data) { $($.parseHTML(data)).each(function() { $('#' + this.id).replaceWith(this); }); })
[02:31:48] <kschlesselmann> Cork: nice. I'll see if I can get that to work :-)
[02:46:28] <furoido> as web devs. i have question regarding ajax
[02:46:51] <furoido> would it be better to QUERY everything first and store it in a JSON?
[02:47:00] <furoido> or just do query whenever needed?
[02:47:07] <furoido> im talking about optimization
[02:47:16] <Cork> are you talking server side herE?
[02:47:34] <Cork> or are you talking about an object and not json?
[02:47:46] <cyberbrai> How can i get the parent div  text
[02:47:55] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/michieljoris/VmtfR/
[02:48:07] <Cork> cyberbrai: you cant really do that
[02:48:16] <Cork> you can get the parent, including all its children
[02:48:20] <Cork> but not just the parent text
[02:48:48] <cyberbrai> $(this).closest('span').text(); i am using some thing like this but can't
[02:49:05] <cyberbrai> Cork is there any way to find out
[02:49:13] <toomus> Cork: How to get elements from third to last?
[02:49:29] <Cork> ?api slice @ toomus
[02:49:30] <b-ot> toomus: .slice(): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[02:50:06] <toomus> THX :)
[02:50:07] <Cork> cyberbrai: that will find the closest span parent, and from there grab all the text it or it children contains
[02:50:13] <cyberbrai> Cork any other alternative
[02:50:32] <Cork> isolate the text in its own element
[02:50:37] <furoido> Cork: it can be both server and client side
[02:50:55] <cyberbrai> isolate sorry not getting
[02:50:57] <Cork> furoido: json means data represented as text
[02:51:05] <Cork> furoido: you normally don't keep json around client side
[02:51:13] <Cork> you normally parse it to objects and arrays
[02:51:31] <furoido> Cork: so its not advisable to store in JSON?
[02:51:51] <furoido> although it can but done but not best practice?
[02:52:03] <Cork> furoido: if you mean var json = "{\"data\":[1,2,3]}" then no not really
[02:52:26] <furoido> yep. thats exactly what i mean
[02:52:27] <Cork> if you by json mean var obj = { data: [1,2,3] }, then sure
[02:52:50] <furoido> i think i mean the 2nd choice
[02:52:58] <Cork> so you didn't mean json
[02:53:01] <furoido> its the response that i get fromthe server
[02:53:40] <Cork> furoido: if the server is configured correctly (so it doesn't lie about what it sends) jquery will automatically parse json to native data types
[02:54:18] <furoido> in php, we do it like   json_encode($response);
[02:54:21] <furoido> isnt it json?
[02:54:36] <Cork> if you only do that, then no, then you send html
[02:54:57] <furoido> ok,
[02:55:00] <Cork> if you set header('Content-Type: application/json'); then yes
[02:55:11] <Cork> you send json and it gets parsed to objects and arrays client side
[02:55:19] <furoido> cuz currently, when doing a onchange, it takes 443 sec to finish execution
[02:55:30] <Cork> O_o
[02:55:35] <Cork> how much data are you sending?
[02:55:49] <Cork> (also are you doing this sync?)
[02:55:51] <furoido> $headers .= 'Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1' . "\r\n";
[02:56:19] <furoido> im not really sure how much data were sending
[02:56:35] <furoido> its just faster in our dev and staging (having fewer data) compared to production
[02:56:36] <Cork> check the browsers network tab
[02:57:40] <furoido> the 443 came from the network tab
[02:57:49] <Cork> that's time not size
[02:57:56] <furoido> oh sorry
[03:01:55] <furoido> its 14.2 kb only
[03:02:07] <Cork> and the sync part?
[03:02:22] <Cork> meaning do you set async: false, anywhere?
[03:03:06] <furoido> yep
[03:03:17] <Cork> ok, that is one of your problems then
[03:03:30] <Cork> cause that means the page will freeze while it is waiting for the server to respond
[03:04:06] <furoido> ok thanks, well try with async: true
[03:04:10] <Cork> the second problem is that your server takes 7 mins to respond
[03:04:19] <Cork> furoido: just remove the option
[03:04:22] <Cork> true is the default
[03:07:30] <cyberbrai> Cork any help
[03:07:44] <CocoStorm> hi
[03:07:55] <Cork> cyberbrai: you could clone the parent, remove all its children and grab the text of what is left
[03:08:01] <Cork> but, that is generally a bad idea
[03:09:33] <CluelessDevelope> Hey guys I could use a hand with something. http://www.mindwise.be/ On the page, the block next to the twitter feed has this sliding element that moves when mouseenter but the fourth one won't do it. If I switch the order in the backend it still remains the fourth one.
[03:10:04] <CocoStorm> I have several elements with <div id="foo" data-bar="1"> ... <div id="foo" data-bar="15"> ... etc and I'm using jQuery to select specific elements i.e  $('#foo[data-bar=' + barID + ']') which works for data-bar="1" but the rest is undefined.  Why is this?

[03:20:21] <tlkr> CocoStorm, id must be unique in DOM
[03:21:01] <tlkr> I'm not entirely sure how it reacts to having the same id in multiple places, but that sounds like the reason you're only getting back the first one
[03:22:20] <CocoStorm> tlkr: ha, you're right. thanks dude
[03:22:36] <CocoStorm> it seems to only check against the first id it finds and disregards all the other elements
[03:22:46] <CocoStorm> I had to use $('div[data-bar instead
[03:25:04] <Cork> CocoStorm: you can't use multiple ids it isn't valid

[05:36:58] <CluelessDevelope> A triangle of 12px by 6px would work
[05:37:21] <CluelessDevelope> It all depends on how you look at design
[05:37:26] <Cork> yup
[05:38:17] <toomus> Cork: Maybe it is a good idea, but I don't have space for button :/
[05:38:39] <Cork> toomus: you can make the button look like an icon at the end of the input field for example
[05:39:05] <CluelessDevelope> Screenshot it real quick. I'll use my master photoshop skills to show you where to put it if I have to ;)
[05:39:26] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/q8Lf96ud/1/ <--- am I doing something wrong here?
[05:41:12] <toomus> CluelessDevelope: I don't know how to make SS in MacBook xD
[05:41:37] <CluelessDevelope> CMD + Shift + 4
[05:42:38] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/q8Lf96ud/2/
[05:42:47] <toomus> CluelessDevelope: where can I find it?
[05:43:21] <CluelessDevelope> By default Desktop
[05:44:43] <Kartagis> Cork: no errors
[05:45:04] <Cork> Kartagis: uh, yes there is
[05:45:19] <Cork> Kartagis: you're trying to do cors and the server doesn't allow it
[05:45:45] <Kartagis> Cork: I allowed it
[05:45:54] <Cork> you might, but the server doesn't
[05:46:23] <toomus> CluelessDevelope: http://i62.tinypic.com/10rj0hu.png
[05:46:48] <CluelessDevelope> FYI toomus use imgur in the future for not shit image hosting ;)
[05:47:01] <toomus> CluelessDevelope: LoL
[05:52:40] <toomus> But how to stop form submit with enter if input is empty?
[05:53:01] <CluelessDevelope> There ya go http://i.imgur.com/GfnIOH2.jpg
[05:53:24] <CluelessDevelope> Do a length check on the value before you do the post
[05:53:39] <toomus> inside input, clever :)
[05:53:49] <toomus> and nice
[05:54:05] <CluelessDevelope> Gave you 2 option
[05:54:07] <CluelessDevelope> s
[05:54:07] <Cork> toomus: not exactly inside, as you can't have things inside
[05:54:16] <CluelessDevelope> Yeah it's fake ya know
[05:54:21] <Cork> but you shift it left with position: relative;
[05:54:26] <CluelessDevelope> ^
[05:55:06] <CluelessDevelope> fr4nk you have the worst connections  :p
[05:56:23] <toomus> Cork: Any ideas about form submit disable?
[05:56:44] <Oka> Event.preventDefault() ?
[05:56:44] <Cork> toomus: just set disable on the button from start
[05:56:45] <srihari> Hi All
[05:56:54] <Cork> and toggle it when the user have entered something in the field
[05:57:02] <Cork> (and back when it is empty
[05:57:03] <Cork> )
[05:57:37] <Cork> $('input').on('input', function() { $('#submit').prop('disabled', this.value.length < 1); });
[05:57:58] <toomus> Cork: ok, but how to disable submit with enter?
[05:58:08] <Cork> i just gave you how...
[05:58:21] <Cork> disable the button and you disable the submit of the form
[05:59:30] <surianup> HI friends
[05:59:34] <toomus> ah, ok, I thought this works independent.
[05:59:55] <surianup> I have an issue I am trung to create a div on a click function
[06:00:17] <surianup> but I need to add a id for that div
[06:01:07] <surianup> becasue that div can be added again and again so the class is same but i need the id different for every div
[06:01:08] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/gq4sv6sc/
[06:01:28] <surianup> for this perticuler div html ='<div class="edit-conatoner removecurrent-'+idval+'" id="removecurrentdiv">';
[06:01:57] <Cork> surianup: you REALLY should start using a template solution
[06:02:10] <Cork> that much html in js becomes close to impossible to maintain
[06:02:22] <Cork> and is most likely that cause of your problems
[06:03:35] <surianup> Cork I can't do anything this project is so so hard maintain
[06:03:57] <surianup> but I have no time to do sucj thing I have started in this project yeserday
[06:04:09] <surianup> and this is working since 1 year ago
[06:04:20] <Cork> well look at the generated html you have done there
[06:04:26] <Cork> and run it through w3c validator
[06:04:30] <Cork> and make sure it is valid
[06:04:37] <Cork> it is the most likely cause
[06:05:01] <surianup> this is working actually I want to delete the added form
[06:07:33] <surianup> Cork
[06:07:39] <surianup> can you please help me
[06:07:45] <surianup> I am very frustated
[06:08:19] <Cork> you mean like $('#removecurrentdiv').remove() ?
[06:08:25] <surianup> yes
[06:08:37] <surianup> you are absolutly right
[06:09:16] <surianup> Cork can i give me my site access
[06:09:17] <surianup> ?
[06:09:35] <Cork> uh, i'm not going to code the site for you if that is what you mean
[06:09:44] <surianup> heheheheh
[06:10:00] <surianup> no no Cork
[06:10:12] <surianup> i though wrong
[06:10:22] <surianup> you thogh wrong
[06:10:34] <surianup> please give me the rough idea
[06:10:36] <surianup> here
[06:11:00] <surianup> I need to add the ID unique for wvery one
[06:11:35] <surianup> when  person click on the class then everytime form open

[06:12:58] <notchris> morning @Cork
[06:12:58] <surianup> I am trying to detete that form
[06:13:00] <surianup> div
[06:13:22] <surianup> But problem is that it deletes the all forms
[06:13:35] <surianup> Cork you there
[06:13:38] <surianup> ?
[06:13:46] <notchris> surfdue: You need to select the form in a more specific way
[06:14:02] <notchris> surfdue: Think about how you can select an individual form
[06:28:11] <PCatinean> simple question, got a button that has class .pdf_del $('button.pdf_del').click(function(){ if (confirm("Are you sure you want to delete the attached PDF?")) {
[06:28:14] <PCatinean> it does not trigger
[06:28:37] <Cork> PCatinean: you most likely bind the event before the button exist
[06:28:44] <Cork> delegate the event to a static parent
[06:28:50] <PCatinean> i do it on document.ready
[06:29:10] <Cork> if the element is loaded through ajax for example, that won't matter
[06:29:22] <Cork> or created in another way through js
[06:31:31] <PCatinean> Cork, it's outputed by the templating language
[06:31:38] <PCatinean> whoops
[06:31:50] <PCatinean> forgot to restart the server that adds the class
[06:31:52] * PCatinean blushes
[06:32:11] <PCatinean> yup works now, sorry!

[06:36:55] <null--> hey guys, im using jQuery datatables and i want to pass multiple objects to a single column someone has an idea?
[06:38:47] <Changa> Hello.
[06:38:54] <CluelessDevelope> Hi.
[06:54:28] <grek> hi please help
[06:54:30] <grek>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29749891/set-initial-data-in-selec2-with-ajax
[07:02:04] <grek> i add more information http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29749891/set-initial-data-in-selec2-with-ajax
[07:02:48] <droid909> guys, i have thing like this: $('.class_here',var_here).show()     var_here looks like cointains element,    what this mean?
[07:03:45] <NoiseEee> droid909: show all elements defined by that selector
[07:04:24] <droid909> NoiseEee: why this var_here  needed
[07:04:32] <droid909> how it used?
[07:04:33] <droid909> this var
[07:05:21] <NoiseEee> droid909: perhaps they want to show this_var as well as all the classes that match
[07:05:43] <NoiseEee> droid909: you can select many things with a single selector
[07:18:12] <sammich> the second argument to a jQuery selector is context
[07:18:24] <sammich> if you leave it out, the context is the document
[07:18:36] <sammich> which is what everyone is familiar with
[07:19:50] <Changa> Hi again, I am trying to make a post submit form with autosave functionality, I've placed a checkbox to enable/disable this feature. I am facing some problems that I am explaining in comments within my code. I have pasted it here -> http://laravel.io/bin/BLy99
[07:19:54] <sammich> for example, if you have an event handler for submit, you could use use $('input', this) to get all the inputs inside the form that fired the submit event
[07:20:07] <sammich> because 'this' is the form element
[07:22:34] <sammich> Changa: 'this' is a special variable that takes on new meaning for every new function
[07:23:13] <sammich> inside the closure that is the anonymous function of the setTimeout, this is actually the 'window' object
[07:23:34] <sammich> what you need to do is to keep a reference to the outer 'this' by assigning it to a variable
[07:24:07] <sammich> pick one: var _self = this, var _this = this, var that = this
[07:24:21] <sammich> then you use it like any other variable
[07:30:01] <Changa> sammich,  so I have to change my function to use a variable instead of this, and set that variable to this within my event handlers and pass it on, do I get it?
[07:30:58] <sammich> show me your updated code
[07:32:35] <Changa> sammich, moment
[07:43:50] <Changa> sammich, -> http://laravel.io/bin/LkNoG  I have tried this , getting error (Argument 1 of FormData.constructor does not implement interface HTMLFormElement.)
[07:45:06] <sammich> where is this occuring?
[07:46:43] <Changa> when I trigger $('form[data-remote]').on('submit'
[07:47:16] <Changa> also on change one too
[07:48:13] <Changa> sammich, error on (line 18, col 12)
[07:50:10] <sammich> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Using_FormData_Objects
[07:50:21] <sammich> you don't create a formdata object from an HTML element
[07:51:44] <Dorf> http://jsfiddle.net/hcrued15/2/ i want a delay on hover and none on mouse out.  what am i doing wrong?
[07:53:20] <sammich> heh, I could guess the problem was that before I opened it http://jsfiddle.net/hcrued15/3/
[07:53:53] <sammich> also, http://www.lipsum.com
[07:53:58] <Dorf> thanks.  i had just figured that out
[07:54:24] <Dorf> sorry if slipsum was offensive
[07:54:46] <sammich> okay, so that exists
[07:54:50] <sammich> that's handy to know
[07:55:48] <Dorf> i have a collection in my bookmarks... lebowski ipsum and whedon ipsom are two of my favorites
[08:01:31] <Changa> sammich, I'm getting more confused by the minute :( , first two event handlers now work like this. third not so much -> http://laravel.io/bin/0elPe
[08:02:49] <sammich> the error is telling you exactly what the problem is
[08:03:13] <sammich> you cannot pass an HTMLElement when creating it
[08:03:16] <zono> how can i close the linter window in vim.  The warnings are taking up half my screen!
[08:04:46] <sammich> Changa: don't know why you're using FormData anyway
[08:05:12] <sammich> you should be able to pass the serialised data from the form object
[08:05:35] <sammich> https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:05:52] <sammich> I need to go now, best of luck
[08:06:42] <Changa> thanks sammich, I'll keep trying
[08:08:40] <Changa> sammich, does serialize work with file input?
[09:41:01] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[10:47:01] <printForever> I'm looking to style RADIO buttons for a FORM. What would you recommend?
[10:47:28] <robertmaxrees> totally depends.
[10:48:16] <printForever> something that masks default INPUT fields and allows to add/style the buttons with CSS
[10:48:30] <robertmaxrees> you could pretty easily build that kind of thing yourself.
[10:48:44] <printForever> no I couldn't
[10:48:59] <robertmaxrees> oh ok.
[10:50:28] <robertmaxrees> did you have something particular in mind?
[10:50:56] <printForever> looking for a script that could do that
[10:51:19] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[10:51:36] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're asking in like three channels at once.  i'll let them help you out :)
[10:51:45] <printForever> :)
[10:51:51] <printForever> I'm on CSS and here
[10:51:53] <robmal> Try iCheck
[10:51:56] <printForever> #web are aresholes
[10:52:04] <robertmaxrees> they had fair points in #web, fwiw.
[10:52:36] <robertmaxrees> you're being pretty generic with your question, either way.  it's hard to understand what you're asking.
[10:52:36] <printForever> they are jerkoffs...
[10:53:58] <printForever> and #css is gone
[10:54:35] <robertmaxrees> a few people answered there, too.  your question is pretty generic.  did you have examples?  something in particular?  or are you really just looking around for various options?
[10:55:01] <printForever> replacing images is an old technique
[10:55:05] <printForever> I've used it several times
[10:55:21] <printForever> I was looking for something differetn, if there is something like that
[10:55:25] <printForever> I found iCheck
[10:55:34] <robertmaxrees> you could generate content with CSS, but your browser support might be a little spotty.
[10:55:44] <printForever> I'm evaluating whcih of the script is fastest and has the smallest footpring
[10:55:47] <printForever> footprint
[10:57:19] <robertmaxrees> the CSS and image replacement options will probably be the fastest and have the smallest footprint if those are really that valuable to you.
[10:57:58] <printForever> I would go back to it if there is nothing suitable out there
[10:59:27] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[10:59:34] <onur> Hi. I am doing some cross/domain requests with jquery (not jsonp). My server is returning 302 for some requests. And jquery is following this and doing another GET request for new location. Everything is fine EXCEPT for safari. When my server returns 302, jquery (or safari) is doing OPTION request instead of GET. Any idea?
[10:59:37] <printForever> :) tnx for replying
[11:00:17] <robertmaxrees> onur http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15093281/safari-ajax-cors-request-not-following-redirect
[11:00:22] <robertmaxrees> it's a safari problem.
[11:00:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to not force that redirect.
[11:16:04] <Fohlen> hey guys. I've got a site where I render the template piece by piece and I am wondering if it is possible to insert jquery-dependant <script> before jquery gets actually loaded (I'd like to do that at the very end for performance reasons)
[11:16:05] <blindMoe> is it possible to trace changes made to a specific element in developer tools?  There is a class that is being removed on an element and I need to know which function is doing it
[11:16:53] <robertmaxrees> Fohlen you cannot do that without some extra wrangling.  i wouldn't worry about the performance implications of putting a script or two in the <head>
[11:17:59] <robertmaxrees> blindMoe you can break on node changes in chrome, but it might not help you in your case very much.
[11:18:28] <blindMoe> yeah I couldn't get an event listener breakpoint to catch it
[11:19:07] <robertmaxrees> you could check the call stack and see if it tells you anything.
[11:20:27] <blindMoe> not even really sure how to do that but ill google it
[11:37:38] <Fohlen> anyone could gimme a hint what's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/84afnq3t/
[11:37:44] <Fohlen> it should mark the currently active site
[11:38:54] <Fohlen> eh
[11:38:58] <Fohlen> wrong javascript, second
[11:39:08] <Fohlen> http://jsfiddle.net/84afnq3t/1/
[12:17:28] <duckxx_> codepen or jsfiddle better ?
[12:25:23] <samssh> duckxx_, Either codepen or jsbin. That's my opinion anyway.
[12:26:11] <duckxx_> k
[12:26:28] <duckxx_> how do i prepend text from what i selected?  --- jQuery("h2").prepend.text("h2");
[12:27:15] <duckxx_> i just want to inject the H2 contents into an A NAME anchor for all the h2's on the page.
[12:27:30] <duckxx_> i think my syntax is off.
[12:27:34] <robertmaxrees> mmhmmm.
[12:27:40] <robertmaxrees> there's no .prepend
[12:27:47] <robertmaxrees> you have to do it manually.
[12:27:59] <duckxx_> http://api.jquery.com/prepend/ ?
[12:29:05] <robertmaxrees> make a quick fiddle showing what you want.
[12:30:56] <gtristan> hi
[12:31:21] <gtristan> is there a way to synchronize animations with jquery .animate() ?
[12:31:38] <robertmaxrees> gtristan call it on multiple things at the same time?
[12:31:42] <gtristan> like to animate 2 object's attributes with a single tween ?
[12:32:00] <duckxx_> http://codepen.io/duckx/pen/yNBZQJ -- whats wrong i have there?
[12:32:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right way to do that.
[12:32:29] <robertmaxrees> prepend is a method, not a property
[12:32:31] <duckxx_> im thinking like PHP i think
[12:32:54] <gtristan> robertmaxrees, I can try - currently I'm doing similar but using bootstrap collapse (a css3 animation) to do an accordian thing
[12:33:02] <robertmaxrees> you need to manually do it with .each(), duckxx_
[12:33:32] <gtristan> the css3 animations fired in parallel dont syncrhonize, so I was going to just do it manually (update both) by hand in a requestAnimationFrame callback
[12:33:49] <robertmaxrees> duckxx_ wait do you want to wrap the text of the h2 in a link?
[12:33:52] <gtristan> but then wondered, jquery maybe does that for me under the hood
[12:34:00] <duckxx_> no i just want an anchor link in there
[12:34:18] <duckxx_> it can be before the h2 .. which is why prepend
[12:34:21] <robertmaxrees> duckxx_ you want an empty link?
[12:34:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:34:24] <duckxx_> yes
[12:34:27] <robertmaxrees> why?
[12:34:34] <duckxx_> for <a name="blah"></a>
[12:34:43] <duckxx_> so i can put an anchor next to each H2 tag
[12:34:52] <robertmaxrees> right - why?
[12:35:01] <hlvwrk> "<a href='#' name='". $("h2").text() ."'></a>"  ?
[12:35:26] <duckxx_> so i can do this: https://css-tricks.com/examples/SmoothPageScroll/
[12:35:32] <robertmaxrees> because the name attribute is deprecated in HTML5, so i'm trying to understand why you think you need that.
[12:35:36] <duckxx_> i can't do it manually since i can't touch the html
[12:35:42] <duckxx_> oic
[12:35:52] <hlvwrk> why not add an ID to the element?
[12:35:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:36:01] <hlvwrk> liek you're supposed to with anchors?
[12:36:04] <duckxx_> or that
[12:36:26] <hlvwrk> and then you target an href #nameofID
[12:36:52] <hlvwrk> don't anchor an href... that's awful and not correct lol
[12:37:13] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JdPxVL?editors=101
[12:37:23] <duckxx_> so ur saying my links should be: <a href="#one
[12:37:27] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:37:32] <duckxx_> and then it will auto jump to id="one
[12:37:33] <duckxx_> ?
[12:37:36] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:37:42] <duckxx_> i've been doing it via name tats why
[12:37:47] <hlvwrk> don't do that :P
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> name is now obsolutete.
[12:37:53] <robertmaxrees> *obsolete
[12:37:54] <duckxx_> ok i see
[12:37:56] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't use it any more.
[12:38:01] <hlvwrk> ^^^
[12:38:13] <duckxx_> so but i still need to grab the html contents of the h2 and put it as the id of the h2
[12:38:19] <robertmaxrees> which i already did.
[12:38:27] <robertmaxrees> i just shared the fiddle to you.
[12:38:31] <hlvwrk> %%
[12:38:48] <hlvwrk> you can use name but don't tie any functionality to it. It's good for organizing a form.
[12:38:53] <duckxx_> oic.. gotcha..
[12:39:01] <duckxx_> thx!
[12:39:04] <hlvwrk> yw
[12:39:06] <hlvwrk> enjoy.
[12:39:31] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees, input name isn't obsolete in HTML5 though, right
[12:39:32] <hlvwrk> lol
[12:39:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:39:36] <hlvwrk> That would be awful.
[12:39:43] <robertmaxrees> name is obsolete for anchor tags.
[12:39:49] <hlvwrk> I'd be all "HTML5 WAT ARE U DOING? :("
[12:39:57] <hlvwrk> I'm ready for HTML6, amiright?
[12:40:03] <robertmaxrees> no don't ;(
[12:40:18] <robertmaxrees> imo we need to stop saying "html5" so much.
[12:40:21] <robertmaxrees> just like "css3".
[12:40:21] <hlvwrk> lol
[12:40:25] <hlvwrk> CSS3 4 LYF
[12:40:31] <robertmaxrees> they're living standards.
[12:40:39] <robertmaxrees> css3 isn't even a thing any more.
[12:40:43] <duckxx_> still need to hone my js skills
[12:41:04] <hlvwrk> duckxx_ this is a great place to learn the do's and don'ts. we'll often point you to the JS API docs though.
[12:41:17] <duckxx_> yea sometimes docs are confusing
[12:41:26] <robertmaxrees> just need to get used to reading them.
[12:41:28] <hlvwrk> yep. that's when you come here and ask away. We're generally helpful.
[12:41:36] <robertmaxrees> pretty straightforward 95% of the time.
[12:41:45] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees is a wizard. as is shoky_
[12:41:47] <hlvwrk> ^^
[12:41:49] <robertmaxrees> nah i'm not.
[12:41:57] <hlvwrk> wizard, hush!
[12:42:15] <ryanneufeld> do not meddle in the affairs of wizards!
[12:42:17] <robertmaxrees> hah.  i just have some experience.
[12:42:21] <hlvwrk> ;p
[12:42:21] <robertmaxrees> ryanneufeld++
[12:42:28] <robertmaxrees> i prefer "jedi" anyway
[12:42:31] <hlvwrk> Shoky on the other hand. He's basically king JS.
[12:42:35] <robertmaxrees> effin' SPACE wizards.
[12:42:38] * hlvwrk tackles shoky_ 
[12:42:45] <hlvwrk> tackles? tickles. *
[12:42:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah shoky is good people.  decx blows my minds sometimes too.
[12:43:04] <robertmaxrees> *mind.  though i guess plurals works?
[12:43:08] <hlvwrk> :P
[12:43:17] <hlvwrk> decx blows mind's~
[12:43:18] <hlvwrk> ;)
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:43:28] <hlvwrk> hahaha
[12:43:40] <hlvwrk> i'm over here laughing in my cube. people are staring. W/E's
[12:43:58] <hlvwrk> I hate being finished working on my bugs for the day at 3:00. 2 hours remain to do nothing.
[12:44:07] <hlvwrk> >_<
[12:44:16] <hlvwrk> Good developer probs. =x
[12:44:40] <robertmaxrees> hahaha, me not having anything to do is a bad sign usually ;)
[12:44:52] <hlvwrk> :(
[12:45:01] <robertmaxrees> there's always something to make better,.
[12:45:17] <hlvwrk> Not two weeks before release ;)
[12:45:30] <robertmaxrees> ew we're moving away from that kind of setup.
[12:45:38] <robertmaxrees> "release when ready"
[12:45:49] <hlvwrk> we were supposed to cut a new branch this morning to work on next release bugs.
[12:45:54] <hlvwrk> that didnt happen.
[12:45:57] <hlvwrk> <_<
[12:50:57] <robertmaxrees> i hate doing big code reviews.
[12:55:35] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees i'm the type who puts 5 bugfixes in a single review.
[12:55:41] <hlvwrk> everyone hates me.
[12:55:42] <hlvwrk> :(
[12:57:25] <DeltaHeavy> At least you didn't write the build system that rejects code that doesn't meet certain code quality standards :p
[12:57:42] <hlvwrk> ;P
[12:58:45] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy i was apart of the team that defined the release-stopping js problems though :)
[12:59:41] <robertmaxrees> including formatting problems.
[12:59:50] <hlvwrk> Ewh
[13:00:01] <hlvwrk> Your team must've loved you.
[13:00:42] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: I enforce formatting too lol
[13:00:58] <DeltaHeavy> TWO SPACE INDENTATION IN HTML
[13:01:11] <DeltaHeavy> Though certain things like that it just generates a report and lets it in
[13:01:15] <DeltaHeavy> Then I fix it later
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> we're working on our feedback loop about that kind of stuff.
[13:03:17] <duckxx_> ok this is wrong obviously: this.id = $this.text().replace(/ /g,'');
[13:03:26] <robertmaxrees> it is?
[13:03:45] <duckxx_> oo ok i guess i got it right
[13:03:48] <duckxx_> i thought it was wrong
[13:03:52] <robertmaxrees> duckxx_ what browsers do you need to support?
[13:04:06] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm you're replacing all whitespace nvm.
[13:04:09] <duckxx_> umm ie9
[13:04:15] <duckxx_> but i kinda screwed that up
[13:04:22] <duckxx_> cuz i used flexbox
[13:04:31] <duckxx_> and totally didn't look it up for ie9
[13:04:38] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Is this kind of stuff a part of "devops"?
[13:04:47] <DeltaHeavy> Cause I feel like I hear conflicting definitions all the time
[13:05:01] <duckxx_> now the site just has to support ie10+
[13:05:12] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy that's what i think of it as.  the operational aspects of development.  tooling and all that.
[13:05:15] <duckxx_> not many ppl use ie9 anyways on that site ..
[13:05:55] <robertmaxrees> duckxx_ i'd do .replace(/\s/g, ''); instead.
[13:06:19] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: I think I want to get more into that as a career. I went to school for sysadmin/networking type stuff so I feel like it'd be a good mix.
[13:06:24] <DeltaHeavy> Going to look into some resources for that.
[13:06:49] <robertmaxrees> that's smart.  it's an interesting field.  We hired one guy on who did our vagrant setups and all that.  really changed the way we spin up new developers.
[13:07:10] <DeltaHeavy> I LOVE provisioning Vagrant boxes and stuff
[13:07:21] <DeltaHeavy> I'm a big Unix guy
[13:07:36] <robertmaxrees> you might be a good fit for that field.
[13:07:37] <DeltaHeavy> Main reason I didn't want to get into sysadmin is cause if I were to admin a Windows domain which I surely would I'd be a pack a day smoker.
[13:07:43] <DeltaHeavy> I also love writing technical documentation
[13:07:52] <DeltaHeavy> And being a code standards nazi
[13:10:35] <robertmaxrees> i used to be super hardcore about that sort of stuff.  i lightened up a little recently.
[13:13:05] <claytonzaugg> Is it possible to click a <pre> tag and select all the text inside and copy it, all with the same one click?
[13:15:28] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg sure
[13:16:07] <claytonzaugg> Any links to how it's done  robertmaxrees?  So far all I'm finding is that I have to make it a textarea for this to work
[13:16:32] <robertmaxrees> https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2014/12/02/definitive-guide-copying-pasting-javascript/ :)
[13:16:53] <robertmaxrees> basically, you copy the text you want to copy to a hidden input, then copy that.
[13:17:38] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/27281043/923919 for some more details.
[13:17:58] <duckxx_> all u guys are front end devs im guessing? just curious what editor do you guys use?
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> i use sublime text.
[13:18:29] <robertmaxrees> and intellij for the rare times i dump into our backend.
[13:18:29] <duckxx_> used to use textmate but just vim for everything now
[13:20:33] <claytonzaugg> thank you robertmaxrees, I'll give it a shot!
[13:35:10] <mrk> do you guys know why $('#embed-html').css( 'cursor', 'url(/assets/'+cursorUrl+'.cur) ,auto ); works everywhere but IE?
[13:36:25] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/7419342/923919
[13:36:35] <robertmaxrees> mrk it's buggy and funky.
[13:37:01] <NoiseEee> and tacky?
[13:37:05] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[13:39:55] <mrk> so.. what can i do
[13:40:09] <robertmaxrees> not use custom cursors?
[13:40:18] <mrk> well that's not a solution XD
[13:40:41] <mrk> I need them for my game.. So IE is just not going to support them?
[13:40:58] <robertmaxrees> IE supports them, just not well.
[13:41:18] <mrk> oh
[13:41:30] <mrk> and how can I get IE to work
[13:42:01] <hlvwrk> Don't support IE9
[13:42:04] <hlvwrk> >_>
[13:42:06] <hlvwrk> That's how.
[13:42:25] <mrk> well its not working on ie11 either
[13:42:32] <hlvwrk> Hmph
[13:42:49] <mrk> i gave up supporting anything under that
[13:42:50] <Arcarc> Is it common to ditch IE9? Thought IE9 was the worst browser to include
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> depends on your needs.
[13:43:10] <Arcarc> True
[13:43:20] <robertmaxrees> if you're building a game, i wouldn't say it's unreasonable to require something more recent.
[13:43:22] <hlvwrk> http://creative-punch.net/2014/01/custom-cursors-css-jquery/ Meh?
[13:43:25] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't be able to get away with it.
[13:43:49] <hlvwrk> IE9 is near pointless to support.
[13:43:59] <robertmaxrees> not in my case.
[13:44:01] <hlvwrk> honestly.
[13:44:02] <mrk> I need to support IE11
[13:44:06] <mrk> at least
[13:44:06] <hlvwrk> mrk, try http://creative-punch.net/2014/01/custom-cursors-css-jquery/
[13:44:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:44:16] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk we make lots of money off of 9
[13:44:23] <robertmaxrees> and enough off 8 to justify the support cost.
[13:44:27] <hlvwrk> Ewh
[13:44:32] <robertmaxrees> it's really not that bad.
[13:44:47] <hlvwrk> We dropped support for XP... so IE10+ is fine for us
[13:44:48] <hlvwrk> lol
[13:44:59] <mrk> even MS dropped support for XP
[13:45:02] <hlvwrk> Yep
[13:45:09] <robertmaxrees> we serve such a large audience that we can't get away with that.
[13:45:10] <hlvwrk> XP be dangerous. As be IE9. ;)
[13:45:23] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees working with the US government?
[13:45:27] <hlvwrk> Ba dum tssss.
[13:45:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:45:30] <robertmaxrees> online home improvement.
[13:45:38] <robertmaxrees> even the gov. upgraded.
[13:45:42] <hlvwrk> Stupid customer base?
[13:45:47] <mrk> that link is more like faking it though
[13:45:47] <robertmaxrees> not stupid.
[13:45:50] <robertmaxrees> contractors.
[13:45:50] <hlvwrk> Old.
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> and older, but our pro segment is guys who aren't "computer types", so they don't buy new machines.
[13:46:07] <hlvwrk> mrk IE sometimes requires some hacky measures
[13:46:19] <robertmaxrees> we make a lot of money and we like to keep it that way.
[13:46:36] <hlvwrk> though, I didn't know IE didn't natively support custom cursors
[13:46:41] <hlvwrk> that seems odd
[13:47:10] <hlvwrk> cursor: url(images/icon.cur); /* IE */   doesn't work?
[13:47:40] <robertmaxrees> that's been supported since like IE6
[13:47:45] <hlvwrk> right
[13:47:51] <hlvwrk> Idk the issue he's having
[13:48:01] <hlvwrk> mrk what issue be you having, good sir?
[13:48:03] * hlvwrk is yoda
[13:48:54] <hlvwrk> typically it's as simple as -->
[13:48:54] <hlvwrk> cursor: url(images/icon.cur); /* IE */
[13:48:55] <hlvwrk> cursor: url(images/icon.png) 0 0, auto;
[14:00:45] <NoiseEee> http://robertmarkbramprogrammer.blogspot.ca/2013/10/css-custom-cursor-that-works-in-ie-and.html @ mrk ?
[14:07:54] <xaxxon> if I have a sortable list and I want to change it by hand in the dom and then make it sortable again.. any way to do that?
[14:08:26] <claytonzaugg> Can you not call this.focus() and this.select() on a <pre> tag?
[14:08:54] <NoiseEee> what would you expect from a focus'd <pre> tag claytonzaugg?
[14:10:11] <claytonzaugg> I'm trying to select the code within the <pre> tag when I click it, but devtools is saying this.select() is not a function
[14:10:38] <mrk> https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/qjfcX7lT0q6wNV8tHzzB can anyone try this cursor and see if it works for you?
[14:11:05] <claytonzaugg> http://jsbin.com/cobejuyodo/1/edit
[14:11:11] <claytonzaugg> NoiseEee, here's an example http://jsbin.com/cobejuyodo/1/edit
[14:11:24] <NoiseEee> like you want the text to be "selected"?
[14:11:31] <NoiseEee> iirc thats generally a nightmare
[14:13:15] <NoiseEee> claytonzaugg: peek at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985272/selecting-text-in-an-element-akin-to-highlighting-with-your-mouse perhaps
[14:13:26] <claytonzaugg> correct, I'm trying to select it all and ultimately copy it.  robertmaxrees showed me a great link on LucidChart trying to do this feat, but I just wanted to select the content of ththe <pre> to see if it can be done
[14:19:28] <duckxx_> hmm interesting issue with anchors.. not sure i need to use js or not.. or if i can just stick with css... http://codepen.io/duckx/pen/yNBZQJ --- so when u click on the anchors.. it gets covered by the menu div ... how would one make the anchor stop below the menu without js if possible.
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to bind to the click and set the scrollTop() of the window to the offset() of whatever div, minus the height of the menu.
[14:20:36] <duckxx_> so i have to use js then ...
[14:20:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:20:44] <duckxx_> ok
[14:23:59] <robertmaxrees> something like this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dobrjx
[14:30:30] <jeffreylevesque> Anyone here an angularJS expert?
[14:30:51] <duckxx_> thx ! works..
[14:31:16] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque there's an angular channel fwiw
[14:31:43] <jeffreylevesque> Is it #angularjs ?
[14:31:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:32:02] <jeffreylevesque> Thank your sir
[14:33:43] <mrk> any idea why seting cursor property of a class doesnt work with IE11 but it works with chrome, FF...
[14:33:46] <duckxx_> as a relatively newbie js guy .. should i learn angular or react ?
[14:34:02] <duckxx_> i've been reading and seems like angular 2 is different when it comes out
[14:34:07] <robertmaxrees> mrk i'd as in #css
[14:34:22] <robertmaxrees> duckxx_ i'd learn react, but that's because i think react is a better framework
[14:35:29] <duckxx_> what i find funny is that back in the days of early front end.. they always say separate your logic from from ur view ... but with all these new front end frameworks it seems they are going back on that.. putting all the logic into the templates.. or am i wrong ?
[14:35:39] <robertmaxrees> you're wrong :)
[14:35:43] <duckxx_> lol
[14:35:46] <duckxx_> -_-
[14:36:02] <triax> hi
[14:36:08] <triax> How to select all input text fields that got required attribute?
[14:36:17] <triax> do I have to use required=required for those attributes (that got no value/shorthand)?
[14:36:24] <julcsi> hello, i am trying to select all elements except the selected one. can you help me how to do it in jquery?
[14:36:42] <robertmaxrees> triax $('[required]') shopuld work.
[14:36:42] <duckxx_> i had another good js dev told me to just learn react instead also .. but isn't angular has a bigger adoption due to Google ???
[14:36:54] <triax> ("input[required]");
[14:37:03] <robertmaxrees> triax you chould try that, too.
[14:37:19] <robertmaxrees> duckxx_ and justin bieber is "more popualar" than kenny wayne shepherd.  doesn't make him a better musician ;)
[14:37:35] <triax> thanks
[14:37:58] <duckxx_> i havent decided what to invest the time in to learn as there seems to be so many of these frameworks now a days
[14:38:03] <robertmaxrees> duckxx_ angular gets some things right and some things wrong.  i happen to prefer the way react does things.  you should also keep in mind that react is just the view layer.  angular tries to be the entire "stack"
[14:38:15] <robertmaxrees> focus on learning good JS first, then go from there.
[14:38:17] <duckxx_> im guessing u feel react is gonna be here to stay for quite some time ?
[14:38:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:38:35] <robertmaxrees> react has a pretty huge backing and big buy-in.
[14:38:50] <duckxx_> what is good JS?? u mean just learn core js stuff ?
[14:39:11] <robertmaxrees> become proficient with it.
[14:40:31] <duckxx_> i think i got the basics down i just dont do it enough everyday to remember stuff
[15:09:39] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, Okay so I can select text now, outside of a textarea or other form input fields, but now I'm challenged with copying it.  Any advice on that part?
[15:34:00] <User900> hi
[15:34:34] <robertmaxrees> hello User900!
[15:35:31] <User900> i want to get the header (h1) of an external page, but i can't. I can do this with jquery with .html() tool, but just if i need that about my own page
[15:35:55] <User900> how can i specify the url i want to get the <h1> value?
[15:36:05] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to ajax the other page in.
[15:36:12] <robertmaxrees> and that assumes the other page will allow you to do that.
[15:36:53] <User900> if i can watch the <h1> value using my browser, then i can using another tools... :/
[15:37:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:37:02] <User900> xD
[15:37:17] <robertmaxrees> not all servers allow you to download from them using Ajax.
[15:37:44] <User900> but i can get the HTML of any page
[15:37:51] <robertmaxrees> not using ajax.
[15:37:57] <User900> why i need ajax?
[15:38:11] <robertmaxrees> because you want to grab the content of another page using javascript.
[15:38:26] <justFredy> hi!
[15:38:38] <robertmaxrees> hey justFredy!
[15:38:44] <User900> yes, just the content of <h1>, i suposu it is what google does
[15:38:48] <justFredy> hi robertmaxress
[15:38:57] <robertmaxrees> User900 google scrapes that content and stores it in a database.
[15:39:00] <justFredy> I hope everyone is doing great
[15:39:04] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't use javascript to get that value.
[15:39:31] <User900> then what they use? php?
[15:39:35] <User900> xD
[15:39:40] <User900> i'm super pro
[15:39:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm actually not entirely sure what their crawlers are written in.
[15:40:00] <justFredy> I already spent almost one week looking for a solution to my jQuery Mobile issue, it is about filters
[15:41:11] <justFredy> do you know WHY in my code with short items works perfect and it doesn't work with long lists
[15:41:27] <justFredy>   <select id="filter-menu-productFilter" data-native-menu="false" class="filterable-select"></select> i populate it with Ajax request
[15:41:27] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball
[15:41:48] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ justFredy
[15:41:48] <b-ot> justFredy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:41:55] <robertmaxrees> something tells me i know exactly what you problem is.
[15:42:46] <justFredy> sure, i will
[15:44:45] <justFredy> http://jsbin.com/huhudugewu/1/
[15:44:50] <justFredy> there is the basic code
[15:45:51] <justFredy> first, on document ready function: I populate with AJAX all these HTML selects
[15:46:00] <robertmaxrees> i don't see a document ready.
[15:46:33] <robertmaxrees> and i don't see your ajax in here...
[15:50:14] <justFredy> ok robertmaxrees here we go http://pastebin.com/bTR5bkWG
[15:50:26] <justFredy> that is all my page
[15:50:38] <justFredy> the filter works perfect for the first 2 select HTML
[15:51:10] <justFredy> the 3rd has a long list of items and there is no filter. In that place is the most important part for doing that
[15:51:27] <robertmaxrees> right, so the issue here is you're fixing the ajax requests and the code keeps going.
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> so the ajax calls don't finish before it hits that other code.
[15:52:31] <justFredy> well, first I look all the items loaded inside these select tags
[15:52:36] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[15:52:39] <robertmaxrees> you're getting ahead of yourself.
[15:52:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:52:50] <robertmaxrees> the ajax calls don't finish in time - they're asynchronous.
[15:52:56] <robertmaxrees> that's literally your entire problem.
[15:53:06] <justFredy> really?
[15:53:08] <robertmaxrees> you need to tell your other code to wait to run.
[15:53:24] <justFredy> uhm
[15:53:37] <justFredy> because first I see all the items: the data is loaded perfectly!
[15:54:09] <justFredy> i click on the first select html and it is a filter-box (search box) exists!
[15:54:13] <justFredy> the second one, the same
[15:54:35] <justFredy> I click on the 3rd (that is a very long list) and there is no search-box (no filter)
[15:54:40] <justFredy> that is my issue
[15:54:51] <robertmaxrees> is that the productsDiv one?
[15:54:56] <justFredy> yes
[15:55:01] <robertmaxrees> do you hit the error callback?
[15:55:47] <justFredy> ?
[15:55:56] <Jeroen2> Hi, I've got an ahref with an onclick. I'd have to update the onclick update when someone clicks on it. Does anyone know how to do this? <a href="#" onclick="event(1, 2, 3)"></a> needs to be: <a href="#" onclick="event(2, 2, 3)"></a> when someone clicks on it.
[15:56:06] <robertmaxrees> jerev don't use onclick
[15:56:12] <robertmaxrees> err, Jeroen2
[15:56:17] <robertmaxrees> justFredy the part where it says "console.log('Failed to retrieve data.');"
[15:56:27] <Jeroen2> what could I use then robertmaxrees?
[15:56:34] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 .on()
[15:56:35] <Jeroen2> As the event should do much more.
[15:56:56] <Jeroen2> I cannot implement .on() on a href?
[15:56:59] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 you should remove all those onclicks and use just .on() for event bindings.
[15:57:06] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 no, nor should you.
[15:57:07] <justFredy> no robertmaxrees, it always success
[15:57:14] <robertmaxrees> justFredy how much data are you returning?
[15:57:25] <Jeroen2> so how can I give 1, 2, 3 for example in that way robertmaxrees?
[15:58:01] <justFredy> 758 elements inside that select
[15:58:22] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yt892f48/
[15:59:05] <robertmaxrees> justFredy i wonder if maybe yopu're running into issues with the fact that you're hitting the same endpoint 3 times.
[15:59:12] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you reorder those calls?
[15:59:54] <znf> Hi. Is it possible to resize the whole viewport after loading a page? ie: to remove horizontal scrolling?
[16:00:26] <Jeroen2> Ok one more question robertmaxrees. I got an image called: image_1.jpg now I need the number there (can be 0-7). How can I get that with JQuery?
[16:00:34] <Jeroen2> <img src="image_1.jpg" />
[16:00:40] <justFredy> well robertmaxrees, it is like a cascade: first filter modify the second filter and the 3rd filter. By changing the 2nd filter, the 3rd select changes.
[16:01:19] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 grab the .attr('src'); and then use a regular expression to get the number
[16:01:53] <justFredy> <robertmaxrees> on document ready I load all by default (1st, 2nd and 3rd select elements)
[16:02:06] <robertmaxrees> .prop('src').match(/\d+/)[0] Jeroen2
[16:02:27] <znf> For example, I have a page which is not mobile friendly, it's original width is 970px, if I load it in the chrome device emulator, the scrolling bars. Even if I remove() all children of body, the scrolling seems to be still present.
[16:02:44] <robertmaxrees> znf what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[16:03:00] <znf> ^ exactly what I said :)
[16:03:18] <robertmaxrees> you want to stop horizontal scrolling?
[16:03:39] <znf> kind of.
[16:03:40] <robertmaxrees> justFredy something seems funky here.  i'd have to see this in action to be able to know, but i get the feeling you're shoving too much data at it.
[16:04:16] <justFredy> lol
[16:04:23] <justFredy> I have the same feeling
[16:04:29] <robertmaxrees> html, body { max-width: 100%; overflow-x: hidden; }
[16:04:31] <robertmaxrees> znf there you go.
[16:05:23] <robertmaxrees> znf i highly doubt you actually want to "resize the viewport", which is why I asked what you're actually trying to do :)
[16:05:58] <justFredy> at first load, and if you check how much data is located at the 3rd select...768 items
[16:06:25] <znf> I have this page: http://anunturi.telegrafonline.ro/anunt/7780616/monitoare/ which doesn't even define a viewport, so the page loads like http://i.imgur.com/5pcz0nl.png on mobile. Now - If I want to add a viewport, I can with $('head').append...; but that also makes it scrollable (vertically and horizontally).
[16:06:49] <znf> which turns it into http://i.imgur.com/5pcz0nl.png
[16:06:53] <znf> errr
[16:06:54] <robertmaxrees> "viewport" is not the word you want.
[16:06:57] <znf> http://i.imgur.com/fJcdmrc.png that
[16:07:09] <robertmaxrees> you keep using that word - what are you actually trying to do?
[16:07:24] <znf> now, if I do $('body').children().remove(); the actual page area remains as in previous screenshot
[16:07:51] <znf> Oh wait. It didn't this time.
[16:08:02] <znf> Ok, false alert.
[16:08:10] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:08:12] <robertmaxrees> okaaay
[16:08:35] <znf> Hmmm. Weird. If I refresh the page in the browser (chrome), it remembers that I have a viewport set from the previous session and it makes it scrollable again
[16:08:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:09:06] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep saying "viewport"?
[16:09:30] <znf> because $('head').append('<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0">');
[16:09:43] <robertmaxrees> ah-hah, you mean the viewport meta tag.
[16:09:46] <znf> yes!
[16:10:12] <robertmaxrees> iirc that needs to be in the page on load.
[16:10:15] <robertmaxrees> can't be added after the fact.
[16:10:19] <znf> seems I can
[16:10:24] <justFredy> so, @robertmaxrees do you know how many elements could be available in order to have that filter?
[16:10:35] <robertmaxrees> justFredy i mean the actual response size from the server.
[16:10:41] <robertmaxrees> not the number of elements.
[16:11:02] <robertmaxrees> znf i ran your code on that page without adding the meta tag and it removed the scrollbars.
[16:11:04] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[16:11:23] <znf> robertmaxrees, refresh the page now
[16:11:28] <Jeroen2> robertmaxrees, how do I use a regelar expression on a var? I want to use "/[^0-9\.]/g" on the var "src"
[16:11:34] <Jeroen2> got something that doesn't work lol
[16:11:41] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 i showed you earlier.
[16:12:07] <robertmaxrees> znf still lets me scroll around.
[16:12:10] <znf> robertmaxrees, actually, do this: load the page; do $('body').children().remove(); see no scrollbars; append the viewport tag; refresh the page, do .remove()
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> *the viewport meta tag.
[16:12:31] <Jeroen2> Ok sorry
[16:12:37] <justFredy> GetCategoriesAndSubCategories = Content-Length:522
[16:12:51] <justFredy> GetManufacturerList = Content-Length:453
[16:13:04] <robertmaxrees> znf i don't understand what that means.  the remove is killing off all scrollbars for me.
[16:13:05] <justFredy> GetProductList = Content-Length:22809
[16:13:38] <robertmaxrees> justFredy hrmm.  that shouldn't cause problems, but you might be choking the browser with that much data.
[16:13:52] <robertmaxrees> modify the server to return a little less and see what happens.
[16:14:52] <justFredy> uhm
[16:15:02] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd try at least.
[16:15:13] <znf> robertmaxrees, https://gfycat.com/GivingDeepEstuarinecrocodile I don't think this should happen
[16:15:34] <justFredy> the problem is that amount of data is a feature...
[16:15:45] <robertmaxrees> znf i'm really confused by what point you're trying to prove.
[16:15:54] <robertmaxrees> you're modifying the page after pageload in pretty fundamental ways.
[16:16:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to end well no matter what.
[16:16:22] <znf> robbyoconnor, right now I'm puzzled as to why appending the meta viewport tag impacts the browser after a refresh
[16:16:27] <znf> I mean robertmaxrees
[16:17:32] <robertmaxrees> you're using chrome mobile emulation.  might be an issue with the way it caches things?
[16:17:43] <znf> I'm not sure to be honest.
[16:17:50] <znf> let's try IE
[16:18:03] <robertmaxrees> why are you appending meta tags to the head after pageload in the first place?
[16:18:51] <justFredy> hey robertmaxrees, here is the demo from jQuery Mobile (long list) it works perfect http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/selectmenu-custom-filter/
[16:18:54] <Jeroen2> Wut
[16:19:03] <znf> robertmaxrees, mostly just playing around, nothing serious
[16:19:30] <Jeroen2> how do I var = 1; var = var + 1;?
[16:19:34] <Jeroen2> Because this gives 11 in stead of 2
[16:19:36] <robertmaxrees> justFredy 50 is very much.
[16:19:45] <robertmaxrees> *isn't very much.,
[16:20:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4me74t8f/
[16:20:24] <robertmaxrees> Jeroen2 that means your initial var set is a string.
[16:21:49] <Jeroen2> Got it
[16:22:21] <snover> Jeroen2: http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html#p_ZUS5EPFCx3
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> boom
[16:27:16] <User900> robertmaxrees, using jquery i can get the element i want but just if they are on my domain
[16:27:41] <robertmaxrees> basically, yes.
[16:28:13] <User900> i can get all h1 elements, for example, even if i search in another page, but just if they are in my domain
[16:28:56] <User900> to do get this in another domains i have to use php
[16:29:00] <robertmaxrees> basically, yes.
[16:29:09] <User900> oks
[16:29:33] <robertmaxrees> this is due to something called CORS.
[16:29:50] <User900> yes, i readed the wikipedia definition of CORS
[16:30:32] <User900> this is because is dangerous to let users run parts of the code into anothers code, or something similar.
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:30:47] <robertmaxrees> it's because of how authentication works.
[16:31:22] <User900> maybe you are true
[16:31:45] <robertmaxrees> if you log into gmail, you're now authenticated for it.  without CORS, I could create a page that used ajax to hit gmail.  because it's running from within a page, it does it as if it were you.
[16:32:10] <User900> wow
[16:32:15] <User900> of course!
[16:32:19] <User900> cool
[16:32:41] <User900> nice example
[16:48:13] <Dr-007> my website is scrolling al the way up when i click on the button of a bootstarp confirmation button thats bound to a container around a drupal fapi fieldset. i don't know which javascript file is triggering this. so i started off with removing the main.js from the theme which binds alot of .js stuff. but then its still happening.. anyone has any tips or tricks to find out what .js is the "bad guy"?
[16:48:53] <justFredy> thank you for the ideas robertmaxrees
[16:48:54] <DeltaHeavy> Dr-007: What's the HTML of the button?
[16:49:45] <Dr-007> DeltaHeavy, gosh
[16:49:47] <Dr-007> thanks!
[16:50:03] <Dr-007> i now notice the # in my browsers adress
[16:50:05] <DeltaHeavy> Figured it out :p ?
[16:50:09] <DeltaHeavy> lol nice
[16:50:11] <Dr-007> haha
[16:50:12] <DeltaHeavy> Thought it was that
[17:21:54] <igyiguygyu> what could be the issue of this - $('#modal1 .workwrapper .work').first().css("display", "flex"); not working on safari?
[17:22:05] <igyiguygyu> on button click
[17:24:08] <robertmaxrees> http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox might have something to do with it.
[17:24:52] <igyiguygyu> Checked already - it's supported
[17:25:02] <robertmaxrees> with prefix.
[17:25:13] <igyiguygyu> Oh! Seems that chrome doesn't need -webkit prefix, so I need to add prefix
[17:25:23] <igyiguygyu> for safari
[17:25:40] <igyiguygyu> I was certain that jQuery adds prefixes
[17:26:18] <robertmaxrees> it should in most cases.
[17:26:21] <robertmaxrees> it might miss some things.
[17:26:42] <igyiguygyu> Clearly it's missing adding -webkit prefix to display: flex
[17:27:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if it looks only at the propety names to see if it should prefix or not.
[17:27:29] <Krinkle> if jQuery does not find a given css property in an Element, it tries vendor prefixes.
[17:27:50] <robertmaxrees> how does it test, though?
[17:27:53] <Krinkle> Even if a value is not explicitly set, browsers still acknowledge that the property exists.
[17:28:07] <Krinkle> e.g. empty string, or 0 or 'initial'
[17:28:12] <Krinkle> not 'undefined'
[17:28:52] <igyiguygyu> IT's a tab structure so on button click it adds display:flex on chrome as intended, but on safari if i manually enable it through tabs, it adds -webkit-display:flex. To display:flex safari is not reacting
[17:31:30] <Krinkle> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/2r7maryv/
[17:32:00] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:32:10] <Krinkle> if ( key in style ) { ... } else { for prefix in ['moz', 'o', 'Ms', 'webkit' } .. camel-transform.. if prefix+key in : ...
[17:32:11] <Krinkle> etc.
[17:32:18] <Krinkle> that's what jQuery does in each css() call
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[17:32:36] <Krinkle> where style = givenElement.style
[17:32:48] <robertmaxrees> right, okay
[17:33:28] <Krinkle> robertmaxrees: I asked jQuery to document this
[17:33:28] <Krinkle> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[17:33:30] <Krinkle> it now is
[17:33:45] <Krinkle> As of jQuery 1.8, the .css() setter will automatically take care of prefixing the property name. For example, take .css( "user-select", "none" ) in Chrome/Safari will set it as -webkit-user-select, Firefox will use -moz-user-select, and IE10 will use -ms-user-select.
[17:33:48] <Krinkle> ""
[17:34:03] <robertmaxrees> then why wasn't that working for the person before?
[17:34:33] <Krinkle> robertmaxrees: I bet the css() call is working fine, but they may be using flexbox wrongly, or expecting something that doesn't exist.
[17:35:24] <Krinkle> If the key doesn't exist, setting it would have no effect, so the prefixing is a good thing
[17:36:32] <igyiguygyu> the thing with flex is that the prefix goes not on the property but on the value
[17:36:37] <igyiguygyu> display: -webkit-flex
[17:37:48] <robertmaxrees> ah - that explains it.  good to know.
[17:38:52] <igyiguygyu> So i'm guessing the jQuery is set up just to add prefixes on the properties not on the values
[17:39:15] <igyiguygyu> this is a dirty fix, but it worked - $('#modal1 .workwrapper .work').first().css({'display' : 'flex', 'display' : '-webkit-flex'});
[17:39:40] <MarkusDBX> Can you use addClass() added classes as selectors?
[17:39:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid doing it that way.
[17:39:53] <robertmaxrees> MarkusDBX yep.
[17:40:53] <MarkusDBX> robertmaxrees: I seldome do.. cool =) thanks
[17:41:05] <MarkusDBX> robertmaxrees: is it bad practice or anything?
[17:41:06] <igyiguygyu> robertmaxrees: why so?
[17:41:34] <igyiguygyu> it just adds 2 css properties from which one is going to be ignored depends on what browser you're at
[17:41:51] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu that's not a valid object - duplicate key.  i'd do two separate .css() calls maybe?
[17:42:02] <robertmaxrees> and check other browsers to make sure you don't break them.
[17:42:19] <robertmaxrees> MarkusDBX it's confusing, but depending on your apps' structure it might be useful.
[17:43:58] <igyiguygyu> ha yeah actually it just uses the second parameter, -webkit-flex works on chrome too but not on firefox therefore firefox is not getting that first 'display':'flex'
[17:44:51] <MarkusDBX> robertmaxrees: ah thanks. going to use for a polyfill, lots of classes only needed for jquery fallback in old ie.
[17:45:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:45:40] <robertmaxrees> why not just use jquery?
[17:46:36] <MarkusDBX> robertmaxrees: css animations are faster
[17:47:42] <robertmaxrees> aaaah for that.
[17:47:43] <robertmaxrees> okay
[17:54:45] <forQuery> i was trying to use a .forEach iteration on an array instead of a .for in loop on an array... but im having a bit of trouble...
[17:54:56] <forQuery> http://pastiebin.com/55359f9786d23  i have my before / after.  does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
[17:55:26] <igyiguygyu> robertmaxrees: so you're saying the best solution is to do separate css calls just like $('#modal1 .workwrapper .work').first().css('display', 'flex').css( 'display' , '-webkit-flex');?
[17:55:51] <robertmaxrees> that'll still break, too, actually.
[17:56:02] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to set one, and then probably browser detect (yuck) for the other.
[17:56:28] <forQuery> or, you can simply swap classes.  i read that is faster too.
[17:56:39] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:56:47] <robertmaxrees> though don't prematurely optimize.
[17:57:08] <igyiguygyu> I tried .attr('style', 'display: -webkit-flex; display: flex'); but i have a different class on it that gets removed
[17:57:33] <robertmaxrees> forQuery var item = res.msg.preview.live_edit[eachWidget]; you don't do this.
[17:57:39] <robertmaxrees> you just reference eachWidget
[17:57:51] <forQuery> yes.  It's my first foreach loop yet
[17:58:04] <robertmaxrees> var item = eachWidget;
[17:58:11] <forQuery> let me try again.  thank you robert
[17:58:13] <robertmaxrees> or just use eachWidget, since that's redundant otherwise.
[17:58:47] <igyiguygyu> forQuery: you mean by swapping classes just adding .addClass('flexbox'); and the class has all the vendor prefixes on it in css?
[17:59:00] <igyiguygyu> and getting rid of the whole .css()
[17:59:03] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu that'd be the smarter way to do it.
[17:59:03] <forQuery> yeah, that's what i was thinking...
[17:59:04] <igyiguygyu> what i have now?
[17:59:12] <robertmaxrees> .addCalss();
[17:59:15] <robertmaxrees> *.addClass()
[17:59:15] <igyiguygyu> ok yeah ill try that, that might be solution
[18:02:54] <forQuery> so, I tried the foreach way suggested.... the good news is, it's closer, got a different error than before.  The bad news is, it still has an error.
[18:02:58] <forQuery> http://pastiebin.com/55359f9786d23 is new pastiebin
[18:03:23] <robertmaxrees> what is eachWidget ?
[18:03:29] <robertmaxrees> a string?
[18:03:33] <forQuery> oh wait
[18:03:36] <forQuery> yes, sorry
[18:03:36] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:03:37] <forQuery> thank you :)
[18:04:15] <xiang> hi, i'm using sinatra and jquery to experiment with a simple single page app, but not i'm not sure how to best handle the html generation
[18:04:22] <xiang> currently i'm using an erb template like so: http://pastebin.com/rUhj4ynN
[18:05:05] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i wish you all good luck.
[18:05:07] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[18:05:53] <xiang> but if i want to, say, add some rows to the table.. i don't want to duplicate the html stuff in the js
[18:07:55] <xiang> would it make sense for the ajax call to expect the html as a response?
[18:08:24] <Dr-007> anyone knows how to destroy all bootstrap.js confirmation/tooltips on the same div? $('#the_div_id').tooltip('destroy'); $('#the_div_id').confirmation('destroy'); does not seem to do the job
[18:09:51] <igyiguygyu> hmm the .addClass doesnt work because I'm calling the tab content to show up as the modal is opened (because tabs are in modal). They by default have display none so by adding class of display:flex that is overriden by display none in .attr(display:none)
[18:09:53] <Dr-007> actually. the confirmation is gone until i use a <option> dropdown.. gmmz
[18:11:54] <forQuery> that worked Robert :)
[18:14:27] <forQuery> I was trying to append all the "eachWidget" iterations to the dom one time... not everytime during the .forEach iteration.   http://pastiebin.com/5535a3ce3f4b6
[18:14:31] <forQuery> My problem is... in order to know which container to append the content, it uses the "eachWidget" for location, which is also the incrementer for the forEach iteration.
[18:14:54] <forQuery> which means I don't think i can use it outside of the foreach iteration...
[18:15:34] <znf> Question: given an array of unix timestamps, is there a way to get the highest value? something like sorting the array based on its value, or, I don't know?
[18:16:49] <rcyr> znf: var highest = Math.max.apply(Math, arrayOfTimestamps);
[18:16:59] <znf> cool; thanks
[18:18:59] <forQuery> before, i used create document fragment... gathered up the fragments into one unit inside the foreach... then appended to an id outside of foreach...  but i can't do that here...
[18:19:25] <forQuery> in this case, all the LI would be appended to the same UL... it's just, the id for the UL is determined by the LI that is being appended.
[18:22:00] <rcyr> If you only target modern browsers, there could be a solution
[18:22:36] <rcyr> Also, how many elements are we talking about here?
[18:22:53] <znf> Given a range of <tags> with a data-timestamp="" attribute, how could I easily create an array or all the timestamps? $('tag').data('timestamp') seems to return just the first one instead of an array
[18:24:26] <rcyr> znf: You want .map
[18:24:44] <znf> cool
[18:24:58] <forQuery> it's between 1 and 15 usually... but they are very large elements with lots nested.  Yeah, only target newest browsers.
[18:25:01] <rcyr> $('.tags').map(function() { return $(this).data('timestamp'); });
[18:25:19] <rcyr> forQuery: requestAnimationFrame could probably help
[18:25:39] <znf> thanks alot of the spoonfeeding, would have taken me at least 20 minutes :P
[18:26:58] <forQuery> yes
[18:28:40] <rcyr> forQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/v6edgc1h/
[18:28:54] <igyiguygyu> So any other solutions to that display flex issue? can't use .addClass nor .attr as it removes existing styles and by putting .css it only reacts to one paramater and I can't add prefixes
[18:28:59] <TheHackOps> rcyr, Mind taking a look at my desperation back "home"
[18:29:14] <rcyr> TheHackOps: :P
[18:29:19] <TheHackOps> ty
[18:29:54] <rcyr> forQuery: I'm actually amazed at how much performant the requestAnimationFrame version is
[18:30:15] <igyiguygyu> $('#modal1 .workwrapper .work').first().css({'display':'-ms-flexbox', 'display': 'flex', 'display': '-webkit-flex'}); this reads only the last parameter.
[18:30:17] <igyiguygyu> onClick
[18:30:17] <rcyr> From now on.... documentfragments are for n00bs if you can use raf
[18:31:26] <rcyr> igyiguygyu: That's invalid.
[18:31:43] <rcyr> igyiguygyu: An object in JS cannot have two keys with the same name
[18:32:39] <forQuery> oh, rcyr!! that's awesome
[18:32:42] <forQuery> thank you
[18:32:47] <forQuery> i didnt even know
[18:34:16] <igyiguygyu> rcyr: is there any solution to that except .attr('style', 'display: -webkit-flex; display: flex'); or .addClass() ?
[18:35:09] <rcyr> igyiguygyu: The easy way out is to open your css file, add a class .flex { all vendor prefixes here } and add the class to the elements
[18:37:30] <igyiguygyu> I tried that but I can't because the element i'm targeting is a tabs target. The tabs target should active if the tab link has class .active but for some reason it doesnt work if I open a modal which is where the tabs and their target is in. So I have to trigger it manually and by default the tabs target has css of display:none.
[18:37:44] <forQuery> if you only used a selector twice... once inside the conditional of an if statement, and once if the if statement is true... should you cache it?  for example: http://pastie.org/10104316
[18:37:45] <igyiguygyu> Hope that makes sense
[18:38:08] <rcyr> forQuery: Definitely.
[18:38:30] <rcyr> forQuery: Also... if it's an id, what you're doing is useless
[18:38:41] <rcyr> $("#draw_" + i) would do the same
[18:38:45] <rcyr> And probably faster
[18:39:20] <rcyr> Because there can only be a single element with a specific id on a page, else it's an invalid document
[18:39:40] <forQuery> oh, hehe, yes
[18:39:42] <forQuery> thank you!
[18:40:16] <forQuery> no, i have invalid document.  I assigned an ID to it because I have INPUT ID / matching LABEL FOR in the HTML...  but then, it's in a template
[18:40:31] <forQuery> i was not able to figure out how to use the for/id and also attach it as a template many times yet.
[18:40:34] <DragonPunch1> hey dudes, i'm having trouble with adding these custom scrollbars to content that is dynamic http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/
[18:40:45] <rcyr> forQuery: I see
[18:40:48] <DragonPunch1> anyone know how to add the scroll bars to dynamically added content?
[18:52:25] <jqueryius> Hi guys, I'm making a web app primarily for mobile
[18:52:31] <jqueryius> when I test in Chrome it's very snappy
[18:52:37] <jqueryius> On my phone it's a bit slower
[18:52:46] <forQuery> one more question about caching...  is it good to cache something like aData[tmplPosition] or... does that not have any performance change   http://pastie.org/10104327
[18:52:51] <jqueryius> Not unuseable, and understandably slower becauser the phone hardware is not as good
[18:53:03] <jqueryius> But there's one particular click event which takes about 2 seconds to respond
[18:53:17] <jqueryius> I don't really care about this, but I would like to put a loading spinner there
[18:53:23] <jqueryius> so the user knows something is happening
[18:53:34] <jqueryius> is there any trick I can use to make the click event respond faster?
[18:58:55] <rcyr> forQuery: Normal JS is plenty fast... what's slow are "repainting"
[18:59:30] <rcyr> Example.. appending an element at every iteration of a for loop is super slow because a repaint is caused at every iteration
[18:59:34] <TheHackOps> Anyone here used jQuery with Telerik grids
[19:00:15] <TheHackOps> rcyr, You could add it to a list of elements to be painted
[19:00:19] <TheHackOps> and then do the paint event at once
[19:00:49] <rcyr> TheHackOps: By using fragments or raf, yes
[19:01:05] <forQuery> got it.  Thank you rcyr
[19:03:40] <jqueryius> if you have........................               var x = 1;       $('y').click(function() { var test = x * 2; }
[19:03:53] <jqueryius> is x still in scope, inside the "y" click event?
[19:04:08] <TheHackOps> jqueryius, where did you define x
[19:04:15] <jqueryius> the line before
[19:04:17] <TheHackOps> Is it global?
[19:04:25] <jqueryius> it looks exactly like the line above
[19:04:32] <jqueryius> var x = 1; then the click event
[19:04:42] <TheHackOps> Yes its still in scope
[19:04:47] <jqueryius> cheers
[19:20:58] <wa5ted> .children returns the immediate children correct?
[19:22:03] <rcyr> Yup
[19:24:01] <Dr-007> selecting multiple $('#id1, #id2').change(function() { .. }); is not possible?
[19:24:09] <Dr-007> or is it onchange..?
[19:24:37] <SirLagz> Dr-007: if you need to do that on more than one element, I'd use a class across all the elements that need that change handler
[19:26:41] <rcyr> Dr-007: That shold work
[19:26:45] <rcyr> *should even
[19:27:04] <Dr-007> you're right
[19:27:21] <Dr-007> im getting sloppy..
[19:27:31] <Dr-007> better go to sleep! l8rz
[20:01:51] <tehJ> Hey, I've got about as noob a question as it gets. I'm trying to use Jquery to run javascript when the DOM is ready. I'm getting 'Uncaught Reference Error: $ is not defined' and the javascript doesn't execute. Here is my html and js in a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/0156wshy/
[20:02:32] <tehJ> According to what I've been reading I'm loading the Jquery before my Javascript, so I don't know what's wrong, any help is appreciated.
[20:03:10] <SirLagz> tehJ: you haven't selected jquery on the left there...
[20:04:26] <tehJ> For my project, I'm not using Jsfiddle though. I'm writing in Brackets. I'm just sharing with Jsfiddle to show the html and js
[20:05:11] <SirLagz> ah right
[20:05:20] <SirLagz> tehJ: paste the entire file to pastebin or something
[20:05:38] <tehJ> the html and js together, or separate?
[20:05:42] <SirLagz> together
[20:05:45] <tehJ> ok
[20:06:37] <tehJ> http://pastebin.com/dfsyPJjD
[20:07:41] <SirLagz> tehJ: is this page going to be used on mobile phones ?
[20:07:56] <tehJ> Yes
[20:07:57] <SirLagz> tehJ: also, you need to source jQuery too, which you haven't done
[20:08:22] <tehJ> So, the jquery mobile doesn't work alone?
[20:09:18] <SirLagz> tehJ: no
[20:09:47] <tehJ> Ah, that must be it. Thanks, I'm completely new to web programming.
[20:10:33] <SirLagz> tehJ: no problems
[20:15:42] <forQuery> so I've successfully changed 10-15 for in loops to be array.forEach() iteration.  It's just... now, I've reached one that gives me a use strict mode error.  http://pastiebin.com/5535c0853e341
[20:35:43] <Mark_2> what do you guys recommend? php, python, or go?
[20:36:43] <rcyr> Anything
[20:36:59] <rcyr> Not sure how it's related to jQuery though.
[20:37:59] <Kartagis> what does false do on document.addEventListenet('event', function, false); ?
[20:38:33] <rcyr> Kartagis: Do you understand the concept of Bubbling and Capturing (Event propagation)
[20:39:06] <Kartagis> not really, but I feel I should go and read
[20:54:36] <forQuery> if aError logs [Object, Object] ... is it okay to use aError.forEach()?
[21:42:11] <night-owl> hey guys, im trying to split a div into two resizable partitions.  im trying to do it with jQuery UI's resizable component at the moment, but it's not quite working out how i want it to.  would anyone mind taking a look, or suggesting a better method for doing this?  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dobEqK
[21:43:47] <night-owl> think ive found a couple of good resources, actually, but any input is appreciated
[22:18:09] <madskillsmonk> Hi, I see there is a $.ajaxSetup method I can use for ajax inheritance if I want ALL ajax methods to contain certain attributes, but I was wondering if there is a way to do that for individual methods. For example. if I want all POST reqeusts to include my CSRF_TOKEN but not my GET requests, is there a way I can do something similar for only POST requests?

[23:43:54] <sebb_> hey guys ! I`m creating a website with a mobile app. I was wondering is there a possibility for me to create a chart animiation somehow with jquery. I`m sending you a image how does it looks like here: http://imgur.com/BdDMvIZ
[23:44:12] <sebb_> I would like to animate some of its charts when I scroll down to my view
[23:44:27] <sebb_> is it possible with jquery? I do I have to do some animation elsewhere ?
[23:52:12] <dopie> hey all
[23:52:14] <dopie> Hey all I have a question how would i do this... when a user is referred from a link from a specific site he gets redirect to page a, if not he goes to the normal page
[23:53:06] <Cork> dopie: currently you can check the referrer header
[23:53:20] <dopie> Cork how would i do that?
[23:53:20] <Cork> dopie: but browsers are planing to reduce the info there
[23:53:31] <Cork> uh, checking the header?
[23:53:37] <dopie> yeah
[23:53:52] <Cork> that depend on your server language
[23:54:34] <dopie> wouldnt i use document.referrer
[23:54:34] <dopie> ?
[23:55:00] <Cork> you could, but that would mean the full page would have to load first
[23:55:16] <dopie> I c...
[23:55:23] <Cork> you normally want to do it server side, so you can redirect the user to the correct target
[23:55:41] <Cork> also note, browsers are planing to reduce the info in the referrer
[23:56:07] <dopie> ok.... so how do i check the header since im using nginx/passenger/apache
[23:56:43] <Cork> those are passive server components, you normally don'y
[23:56:46] <Cork> *don't
[23:57:05] <Cork> though you might be able to do it with a apache htaccess (donno)
[23:57:17] <Cork> dopie: it is normally done with active server code
[23:57:59] <dopie> hmmmm...
[23:58:02] <dopie> getting more confused
[23:58:27] <Cork> active server code is: php, asp, ruby, node.js, python, rails ...
[23:58:37] <Cork> not the underlaying server
[23:58:38] <dopie> ruby/rails is what im using :)
[23:58:47] <Cork> => #rubyonrails
