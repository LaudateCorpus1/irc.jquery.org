[00:34:37] <VentureGuy> Having trouble with jQuery-UI progressbars.  The game I am working on runs in Twine 1.4.2, slightly modified to run jquery 3.2.1 and jquery-ui 1.12.1.  This version of Twine adds and removes elements from the page dynamically through a method I have not yet divined, so I've had to set up a "GC" since it doesn't remove elements in a way jQuery detects. However, my usual method of destroying it via $('#progressbar').progressbar("destro
[00:34:37] <VentureGuy> y").attr("id",null) doesn't appear to clear the progressbar state,
[00:34:47] <VentureGuy> Is there something I'm missing?
[00:37:21] <VentureGuy> I should note that removing dialogs and spinners with a similar process works perfectly, it's just progressbars.
[01:50:20] <ReedK0> I'm trying to use cookies with jquery....
[01:50:42] <ReedK0> I looked at a tutorial, and it said to get 'jquery-cookie', but I read that is no longer maintained because it is superceded by jscookie
[01:50:56] <ReedK0> Do I need those?  Isn't there a way to handle cookies built into jquery?
[02:01:20] <Cork> ReedK0: you can handle it "natively" but that is just a string
[02:01:53] <Cork> ReedK0: document.cookie
[02:02:14] <Cork> you will have to parse it manually if you don't use something like jquery-cookie or jscookie
[03:46:14] <bluo> can somebody help me with this? My jquery datepicker is not highlighting today. What  can possibly be the reason?
[03:47:20] <bluo> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=D79ay914mf here is the script, if it helps
[05:02:14] <Cork> bluo: don't forget to save the jsfiddle
[05:03:34] <bluo> Cork: saved, but some guy constantly changing it, writing some crap into it.. I dont know whats wrong :/
[05:04:03] <Cork> bluo: remove the togetherjs=D79ay914mf
[05:04:46] <Cork> what you want is something like https://jsfiddle.net/<hash>
[05:04:48] <bluo> http://dpaste.com/3VNKJS0 --> can you please check this meanwhile
[05:05:14] <bluo> http://jsfiddle.net/7ab857od/ : here it is
[05:06:27] <Cork> datesDisabled:array, array isn't defined
[05:06:39] <Cork> updated the rest http://jsfiddle.net/7ab857od/1/
[05:06:51] <Cork> end isn't defined either
[05:09:06] <bluo> Cork: its just some part of the code, array is defined somewhere else.. I will comment that tho..
[05:09:33] <Cork> bluo: the jsfiddle should preferably show the problem you need help with
[05:09:47] <Cork> else it requires ppl to render the code in there head
[05:09:56] <bluo> Cork: sorry for that...
[05:10:13] <Cork> No problem
[05:10:26] <Cork> it just means you will have a harder time to get a response
[05:10:38] <bluo> Cork: The current date is being highlighted in fiddle but not in my application..
[05:10:53] <bluo> Cork: alright! noted :) thx!
[05:10:55] <Cork> bluo: ok, so the problem is not with the code you have there
[05:11:08] <Cork> 1. open the developer console and make sure you have no errors
[05:11:31] <Cork> 2. make sure that all selectors you run actually match the elements you expect (so for example they don't run before the element exist)
[05:11:52] <Cork> 3. make sure you don't replace the element after you've done something (there by removing the event handler, plugin or similar)
[05:12:02] <Cork> those are the suggestions i can give you
[05:12:47] <bluo> Cork: will check them!
[05:13:33] <bluo> Cork: any other reason? because, the calendar is working perfectly fine, every function in my page works, just that currentday is not highlighted
[05:13:58] <Cork> something else might run and set the value?
[05:14:07] <Cork> can't really say i know of a fifth reason
[05:16:26] <bluo> Cork: will see. thanks!
[05:59:47] <noob_on_rails> hey all , how can i target a specific element in a page , and invoke one of it's actions , for example resize
[06:04:11] <undefined_bob> if I open my menu in a resized window or on a mobile divice, it happens that the subsub menu is already expand even if one only click to expand the sub menu. I cant really spot to error but maybe there is something wrong with the collapse and expand function in the js?

[14:13:34] <zephirus> Hi. I have a table with a checkbox on each row and a select element in each row also. If a checkbox is not selected, the row color is the default one but when the checkbox is selected, I want the row color to change depending on the select choice. How can I implement this? I know how to change but only on the select box.
[14:15:16] <zephirus> this is my code - https://paste.ee/p/QNSTt - I'm using this in drupal by the way but I think it's generic
