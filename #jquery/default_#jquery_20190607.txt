[03:52:23] <ponsfrilus> Hi everyone, there were a fantastic course on jQuery selectors on learn.jquery.com but I can't find it any more. Anyone remember who provided it (it was hosted on a e-learning platform) and if it's still reachable somewhere? Thanks!
[03:54:40] <thykka> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[04:38:03] <Cork> ponsfrilus: you're not talking about http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/ ?
[04:38:16] <Cork> cause i don't think there's ever been anything else for selectors
[04:39:52] <ponsfrilus> @Cork no, it was an interactive e-learning course, with video and validation of your code's ouput. It was about using jQuery selector to arrange element on a shop, it was about plane tickets if I remember well...
[04:40:10] <Cork> huh interesting... you're sure it was on learn.jqoery.com?
[04:41:18] <ponsfrilus> @Cork yes pretty much. But it was like 2 or 3 years ago... :(
[04:41:55] <Cork> tried the wayback machine?
[04:41:56] <ponsfrilus> @Cork or maybe it was on try.jquery.com
[04:42:08] <Cork> that sounds more likely
[04:42:16] <ponsfrilus> @Cork good idea, will do it
[04:43:26] <ponsfrilus> @Cork yes it was try.jquery.com on codeschool → https://web.archive.org/web/20160323080417/http://try.jquery.com/
[04:44:18] <Cork> well welll well, didn't know that
[04:45:53] <ponsfrilus> @Cork anyway, thanks for the head up on wayback machine, at least I got something now. These interactive lesson was very well done for any beginners.
[04:46:43] <Cork> ponsfrilus: 2016... it might be wrong for current days jquery though
[04:46:57] <Cork> i suspect it got removed cause they moved from .bind to .on
[04:47:14] <ponsfrilus> @Cork agree - but selectors didn't moved that much...
[04:47:28] <Cork> selectors shouldn't have changed any
[04:47:42] <Cork> (as most of them are just straight css)
[04:47:55] <ponsfrilus> yep
[04:48:05] <ponsfrilus> Maybe CSS3 stuff
[04:48:23] <ponsfrilus> gtg → thanks @Cork
[04:48:32] <Cork> those are just what you can select not syntax
[04:49:01] <Cork> and the only thing new in css is the :matches() and a few similar things
[05:25:45] <Rob_Jones> If i have an empty element with an id of file_types and I want to append that to say Supported File Types: ext[0], ext[1] ... etc
[05:25:53] <Rob_Jones> how would i do that in jquery
[05:27:59] <Rob_Jones> for arguments sake lets just say let ext = ["csv","doc","zip"]
[05:29:18] <Cork> Rob_Jones: you know that jquery isn't a language right?
[05:29:41] <Rob_Jones> no its a library
[05:29:51] <Cork> it is just a framework, so you would just use the normal javascript methods
[05:30:34] <Rob_Jones> i get that but im not that good with each function anyway
[05:30:47] <Rob_Jones> if it was php I wouldn't have an issue.
[05:31:28] <Cork> so you want to add a string to an array?
[05:31:34] <Cork> or what exactly is the question?
[05:31:56] <Rob_Jones> no I want to append a html element with a string then each value in the array
[05:32:16] <Cork> jquery doesn't do html
[05:32:29] <Cork> so it won't help you much there at all
[05:32:31] <Rob_Jones> so using .html() isn't feasible?
[05:32:51] <Cork> sure it will give you a string and then your pretty much on your own
[05:33:03] <Rob_Jones> ok so lets work with that
[05:33:06] <Cork> jquery works with dom
[05:33:18] <Rob_Jones> I have a string and I have three strings in an array
[05:33:27] <thykka> $('#file_types').text(['csv', 'doc', 'zip'].join(' '))
[05:33:33] <thykka> idk how you want to format it
[05:33:43] <Rob_Jones> spaces between values
[05:34:00] <thykka> then that ^ should work
[05:34:21] <Cork> Rob_Jones: if you just want to set it as text in the element then ya that does it
[05:34:38] <thykka> for text, .text() is the preferred method
[05:34:45] <Rob_Jones> $('#file_types').text('Supported File Types:'+ext.join(' '))
[05:34:49] <Cork> but "append" made me take it you wanted to do something more advanced
[05:34:50] <Rob_Jones> would that work
[05:34:56] <Cork> ya
[05:35:13] <Rob_Jones> right will just try that
[05:35:18] <Cork> i would prob add it as a separate span though
[05:35:30] <Cork> would make modifying it cleaner
[05:35:41] <Rob_Jones> so something like
[05:35:42] <thykka> is this related to a file upload form?
[05:36:01] <thykka> because a file input can take a list of allowed file/mime types
[05:36:15] <Cork> i would say share what you're trying to do, not how your trying to do a fraction of it
[05:36:16] <Rob_Jones> <p id="file_types">Supported File Types: <span id="extensions"></span></p>
[05:36:28] <Cork> cause you're bound to get bad answers as long as you're doing that
[05:37:10] <thykka> answers aren't bad in themselves, but without context there's no chance to point out better methods
[05:37:38] <thykka> and there's always more than 666 ways to skin a cat
[05:37:44] <Cork> well the answers are for the question asked, but the result still tend to be bad
[05:40:47] <thykka> "how can I rotate my car 180° by it's z-axis?" "why?" "i wanna change the front light and the bulb is screwed in.."
[05:44:53] <Rob_Jones> get that im just not allowed to show the code :/
[05:46:02] <Rob_Jones> brb
[09:22:44] <bravvve22> hello im using jquery to upload file using dropzone the file is uploading webb,but the utf 8 in the form sent with file is not reconized
[09:25:09] <Cork> bravvve22: are you sending the form to your own server from your own webpage?
[09:30:18] <bravvve22> Cork:yes, there is the code https://pastebin.com/RNmxmTqc
[09:30:48] <Cork> bravvve22: ya, then the problem isn't with jquery
[09:31:05] <Cork> either the page isn't handling utf8 or the server doesn't
[09:31:21] <Cork> the ajax will just send the data
[09:32:08] <Cork> the pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1" makes me suspisious for example
[09:38:13] <bravvve22> Cork:i'v tried  pageEncoding="UTF-8"
[09:38:28] <Cork> bravvve22: ya, i was only an example
[09:38:39] <Cork> but you need to see first what data the browser actually send
[09:38:49] <Cork> and later what the server actially gets
[09:38:57] <Cork> and finnaly what the server actually processes
[09:39:17] <Cork> statt by checking the browser console network tab
[09:39:51] <bravvve22> the server get some ????????? characters
[09:40:05] <Cork> ya, so start by checking the browser tab
[09:40:22] <bravvve22> ok 1mn
[09:40:28] <Cork> don't jump steps, you need to check step by step
[09:41:55] <bravvve22> 1 thing,the same post resquet sent by button html work just fine
[09:42:53] <Cork> ya, i suspect the page is in a confused not fully utf8 state
[09:43:27] <Cork> can't say i know too much about that, was WAY to many years ago since i last allowed a page to be in that state (cause it causes to damn many bugs)
[09:45:26] <bravvve22> can take look www.chtaybou.com
[09:45:58] <bravvve22> + Inscription d'un produit ,when loading image
[09:47:02] <Cork> uh... at least give the real url and not just an iframe -_-'
[09:47:33] <thykka> Sacré bleu
[09:47:42] <Cork> ya, the page is iso-8859-1, not utf-8
[09:48:00] <Cork> so all data handled in the page will not be in utf-8
[09:48:11] <Cork> (including all javascript)
[09:51:28] <bravvve22> event with utf-8 evrywhere,that does not work, and the  data.formData every thing is fine am getting it just right
[09:52:18] <Cork> yout server is still stating that the page is ISO-8859-1
[09:53:27] <thykka> with a properly set-up server, you shouldn't even need to specify encoding within the HTML document..
[09:53:37] <Cork> ya
[09:53:48] <Cork> also link tags don't have a close tag >_>
[09:54:01] <thykka> Content-Type header would be in charge of that, or even just a BOM mark
[09:54:22] <Cork> ya, and content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1" is not utf8 everywhere...
[09:55:25] <Cork> also your html is full with errors >_> you should prob run it through a w3c validation to make it easier to read
[09:55:30] <bravvve22> no,a was giving a try with that
[09:55:54] <bravvve22> w3c?
[09:56:19] <thykka> https://validator.w3.org/
[09:56:56] <Cork> but run the page, not the iframe!
[09:57:15] <thykka> 31 errors, 8 warnings
[09:57:23] <thykka> someone has some work to do :)
[09:57:39] <thykka> first one:
[09:57:41] <thykka> Internal encoding declaration iso-8859-1 disagrees with the actual encoding of the document (utf-8).
[09:58:07] <thykka> third one: Bad value text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1 for attribute content on element meta: charset= must be followed by utf-8.
[09:59:27] <bravvve22> ok
[09:59:54] <undefined_bob> I'm forced to use that crap charset too, hate it
[10:00:12] <Cork> legacy sites tend to use it
[10:00:24] <Cork> unless someone takes the headace of migrating it to utf8
[10:00:33] <Cork> and that can be REALLY messy
[10:00:51] <Cork> though that is basically only 15+ year old sites
[10:01:03] <undefined_bob> ye, boss want to keep this annyoing wannabe CMS for the company website
[10:01:15] <undefined_bob> and this CMS doesn't support UTF-8
[10:01:24] <Cork> it most likely does
[10:01:36] <undefined_bob> sadly not
[10:01:41] <Cork> but the database data is in iso-8859-1
[10:01:46] <undefined_bob> not in an official way
[10:01:53] <Cork> and you can't just switch iso to utf
[10:01:55] <undefined_bob> there is no DB
[10:02:04] <Cork> how is it a cms then??
[10:02:23] <Cork> it writes text files on disk?
[10:02:24] <undefined_bob> no, and the software manufacturer stated "sorry, our software does not support UTF-8"
[10:02:33] <undefined_bob> yes, it does
[10:02:38] <undefined_bob> many text files
[10:02:46] <Cork> ok, so the files it writes gets encoded in iso-8859-1
[10:02:50] <thykka> D;
[10:02:59] <undefined_bob> yes
[10:03:05] <Cork> the factes stay, you can't easily switch iso-8859-1 to utf-8
[10:03:08] <Cork> it isn't compatible
[10:03:32] <Cork> it has to be loaded into a program that know how to map it and rewrite it as utf-8
[10:03:41] <Cork> so it can be really combersome
[10:03:44] <undefined_bob> yes
[10:03:57] <Cork> so ususally, existing sites don't switch, they stay
[10:04:12] <Cork> and leave the switch for when the site gets thrown away and started over
[10:04:13] <bravvve22> ok,the frame staff is not me,its the dns provider
[10:04:32] <undefined_bob> and the rewrite have to be done everytime someone made changes on the site and generate a new version with the software
[10:04:41] <Cork> bravvve22: the iframe is just a hide the real url solution
[10:04:55] <Cork> and it makes the site a pain to visit as you can't bookmark it
[10:05:26] <Cork> bravvve22: i would recommend to just use http://chtaybou.fennec.online/ instead
[10:06:01] <bravvve22> event with localhost same thing
[10:06:35] <Cork> bravvve22: make sure you get the page into a fully utf-8 state
[10:06:55] <Cork> then you should have an easier task to get the post to actually be utf-8
[10:09:10] <bravvve22> am getting in the same servlet the form submit html button and throught dropzone,with the button every thing is just fine,but not with the dropzone
[10:12:37] <bravvve22> hhhhhhh,the broser is sending utf,but the server is getting some thing else
[10:14:33] <bravvve22> ops,its server thing
[12:54:54] <poboy> so here's my brainfart problem.  I'm trying to return a method that starts with a variable name.  return variable+lastPartOfMethodName();
[12:55:03] <poboy> what is the right syntax?
[12:55:09] <robertmaxrees> there isn't?
[12:55:15] <thykka> nnnope
[12:55:19] <poboy> wow.
[12:55:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not really a thing you can do.
[12:55:26] <poboy> bummer,ok.
[12:55:28] <thykka> if it's a member of an object, you can
[12:55:41] <thykka> myStuff[someVar + '_fn']()
[12:56:19] <poboy> series of if statements I guess.  if (variable === 'first') return fullMethodName()
[12:56:33] <robertmaxrees> that seems... odd.
[12:56:37] <poboy> yeah
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> why are you changing the name of the function you're returning?
[12:56:45] <poboy> that's why I'm bewildered that I can't do it the other way
[12:57:13] <robertmaxrees> dynamic variable names are a bad idea :shrug:
[12:57:19] <poboy> values coming in are "monthly", "quarterly", "yearly".  all I need to do is call "monthlyFeedbackChart()"  or "yearlyFeedbackChart()"
[12:58:03] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[12:58:11] <thykka> feedbackChart = { monthly: () => { ... }, yearly: () => {...}, quarterly: () => {...} }; feedbackChart[period]()
[12:58:52] <poboy> thykka: hmm, I'll work on that.  thank you
[12:59:19] <thykka> heck, you could probably even generate the functions based on the possible 'period' values
[12:59:52] <poboy> those functions already exist and are used elsewhere, I just need to call them
[12:59:58] <thykka> right
[13:03:24] <taplar> function feedbackChart(type){ if (type === 'monthy') ... else if ... }
[13:06:27] <poboy> got it, thanks.  Sorry for the dumb Q
[13:07:01] <robertmaxrees> not a dumb q :)
[13:21:53] <taplar> mmm, nug got promoted
[13:22:50] <taplar> X(
