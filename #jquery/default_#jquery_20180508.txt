[01:48:04] <Minnebo> Hi again guys!
[01:48:28] <Minnebo> I'm struggling with one thing! I have an existing button, and I need to add a on Onclick event to it
[01:48:29] <Minnebo> any clues?
[02:10:52] <Minnebo> jQuery('#8_element_submit7').attr("onclick", "fm_submit_form('7')");
[02:10:57] <Minnebo> syntax looks ok?
[02:15:42] <Cork> no, not at all
[02:15:49] <Cork> Minnebo: use .on(
[02:16:12] <Cork> on<event> attributes should be avoided
[02:16:40] <Cork> $('#8_element_submit7').on("click", function() { fm_submit_form('7'); });
[02:17:04] <Cork> or add the number as a data- attribute and just call .on('click', fm_submit_form);
[02:29:17] <Minnebo> Cork, thanks gonna try right now
[02:29:49] <Minnebo> when I inspect element, it will write the onclick html tags too right? :p
[02:30:01] <Cork> no
[02:30:22] <Cork> on<event> _attribute_ is a dom0 (very VERY legacy code)
[02:30:42] <Cork> the biggest problem with it is that you can ever only have one per element
[02:30:55] <Cork> and it uses eval and a lot of other ugly stuff
[02:31:12] <Cork> Minnebo: btw if you're submitting a form you should use submit on the form instead of click on the button
[02:31:49] <Minnebo> Cork, the issue is that the form submit button is generating wrong code :(
[02:32:13] <Cork> "generating wrong code"??
[02:32:22] <Cork> you mean the js hook bound to it?
[02:34:00] <Minnebo> Well it is a wordpress module, they support of the module says there is an issue that appears randomly when having more than 30 fields on the form.
[02:34:13] <Cork> O_o'
[02:34:24] <Cork> i don't think i would use that module at all...
[02:34:44] <Minnebo> true
[02:35:04] <Minnebo> however if I can make the botton work.. it is for internal use only that form so its fine ^^
[02:35:18] <Cork> Minnebo: something like this is what i would recommend https://jsfiddle.net/g6090x2L/
[02:35:30] <Cork> though line 2 should be replaced with a selector for the form
[02:37:02] <Minnebo> this is what I see in my HTML when I inspect element; <button type="button" class="button button-hero button-submit" id="8_element_submit7" value="Submit">Submit</button>
[02:37:16] <Minnebo> this is what it should be; <button type="button" class="button-submit" onclick="fm_submit_form('7');">Submit</button>
[02:37:18] <Cork> ok, so the module doesn't use event attributes
[02:37:23] <Cork> no it shouldn't
[02:37:41] <Cork> and the reason things fail is most likely cause they use submit events not click attributes
[02:37:55] <Cork> so you will make things run multiple times
[02:38:46] <Cork> Minnebo: what you want to do is remove the old hook and add your own
[02:38:59] <Cork> not add a click attribute on the button
[02:39:40] <Minnebo> Ok, how can I determin a selector for the form? (sorry for the noob questions, first time jQuery). I have tested the jQuery with alerts etc so my little script is executing though ^^
[02:39:52] <Cork> check for an id or class on the form
[02:41:27] <Minnebo> <div class="wdform_column"><div wdid="28" class="wdform_row"><div type="type_editor" class="wdform-field">
[02:41:28] <Cork> Minnebo: the reason you don't want to use click, is cause it breaks the form, there are multiple actions a visitor can do in a form that won't trigger a click
[02:41:30] <Minnebo> any id or class?
[02:41:43] <Cork> class, but that is divs not forms
[02:42:00] <Cork> also <div type="type_editor" is invalid...
[02:43:43] <Minnebo> <form name="form7" action="/technische-audit-gdpr/" method="post" id="form7" class="fm-form form7"
[02:43:45] <Minnebo> this one!
[02:43:48] <Cork> yup
[02:43:52] <Minnebo> fm-form form7?
[02:44:26] <Cork> $('#form7').on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); fm_submit_form('7'); });
[02:45:21] <Cork> .fm-form might be an option if it is the module name and you want to support multiple forms
[02:46:41] <Minnebo> https://jsfiddle.net/g6090x2L/1/
[02:46:44] <Minnebo> like this?
[02:47:10] <Cork> as it apparently doesn't exist an onclick attribute you can remove line 1; but yes
[02:54:57] <Minnebo> Cork, it works the form gets submitted
[02:55:16] <Minnebo> : )
[03:17:43] <sonu_nk> hi there , can some one knows the ip location api which can give 100% accurate result ?
[03:21:44] <Cork> no, cause it isn't possible
[03:22:10] <Cork> you can get the correct country, but closer then that isn't possible (with 100% accuracy)
[07:15:41] <moef_> Hey. Anyone know how to only find the <li> elements of depth 1 instead of the recursive behaviour resulting from li:last-child?
[07:18:02] <Cork> depends on where you select it from
[07:18:28] <Cork> (preferably create a jsfiddle showing what you have problem with)
[07:19:29] <moef_> Ahh I think I found it in a documentation
[07:19:39] <moef_> I think you're supposed to use "last" and not "last-child"
[07:19:44] <Cork> no
[07:19:54] <Cork> the only difference is it will only select the last match
[07:20:02] <moef_> ah you're right
[07:20:04] <Cork> it won't automatically know about depth
[07:20:20] <moef_> Let me do it right and give you a fiddle :)
[07:20:35] <Cork> so your question was wrong if that is what you needed
[07:21:03] <Cork> for css selectors to know about depth you have to tell them "from where"
[07:21:07] <moef_> nono you're right, my question was correct but my assumption of last vs last-child wasn't
[07:21:42] <moef_> https://jsfiddle.net/r4Lm6b7j/
[07:22:24] <moef_> How do I select only "Language"? My current query gives me a recursive last-child so I get a list of 3: "Latest firmware, Language & English"
[07:22:36] <moef_> I want to only select the first depth last child resulting in Language
[07:23:12] <Cork> explicitly language from the outermost ul?
[07:23:35] <moef_> Exactly
[07:24:05] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/r4Lm6b7j/1/
[07:24:42] <moef_> Ah beautiful :)
[07:24:51] <moef_> Thanks Cork
[07:24:54] <Cork> to get the exact text https://jsfiddle.net/r4Lm6b7j/2/
[07:24:56] <Cork> np
[07:25:14] <moef_> Wait
[07:25:22] <moef_> Does it return a html element or a string?
[07:25:30] <Cork> it uses .text()
[07:25:35] <moef_> a :s
[07:25:44] <Cork> remove that part and you get a normal jquery object
[07:25:48] <moef_> I need the element so I can append an element to the list
[07:25:56] <Cork> i just added .text() for display purpose
[07:26:08] <Cork> take /1/ and remove .text() and you will get that
[07:27:04] <Cork> moef_: https://jsfiddle.net/r4Lm6b7j/3/
[07:27:40] <moef_> Thanks but I need an element appended at the outermost layer
[07:27:53] <Cork> so change the selector
[07:27:55] <moef_> yeah
[07:28:09] <moef_> change it to #menu-main-top-nav > li:last-child  right?
[07:28:23] <Cork> depends on what you need to do
[07:28:30] <moef_> Sure
[07:28:42] <moef_> Your solution is almost my initial query actually
[07:28:58] <moef_> turns out I had left out the ">" between the ID selector and the last-child selector
[07:29:16] <Cork> ya, and then you select on any level
[07:29:32] <Cork> so it would select English for example
[07:29:35] <moef_> Exactly :)
[07:29:48] <moef_> I appreciate your help today, taught me some essentials ;)
[09:14:55] <JuJUBee> I have a selection list of classes separated by term (high school).  I want to scroll into view the section of classes for current term.  Suggestions?
[09:15:38] <JuJUBee> I have each group of classes (for term) in an optgroup
[09:22:25] <Cork> JuJUBee: the construct is complex enough that it is prob best to make a jsfiddle showing what the group looks like
[09:37:34] <JuJUBee> Cork https://jsfiddle.net/knichel/fedbdyg7/
[09:38:21] <Cork> ah a select element
[09:38:39] <Cork> as that is a replaced element it might be quite tricky...
[09:39:24] <JuJUBee> yes, we are in term 4 so I want the Term 4 section to be at the top by default
[09:39:59] <JuJUBee> I can change the element if optgroup or select is not going to work.  Just hate scrolling all the time
[09:41:03] <Cork> to be perfectly honest... i'm not sure you can
[09:45:02] <Cork> JuJUBee: ya, the only solution i can think of is to change the order of the elements in the dropdown
[09:47:21] <JuJUBee> Cork, thanks anyway.  I had a feeling it was a longshot.
[09:47:41] <Cork> JuJUBee: an option is to replace the select element with something else
[09:50:49] <preference> Cork: i have seen many checkout pages which default at "United States of America", and when you open the select it starts off in that section. would this not be possible in this case?
[09:52:20] <Cork> preference: that is done by setting the selected value on a "default" value
[09:52:31] <Cork> i don't think that is what he wants here (but i might be wrong)
[09:52:53] <Cork> it would be like this in that case https://jsfiddle.net/fedbdyg7/1/
[09:53:10] <preference> right, but could JuJUBee not just change the default based on what he needs?
[09:53:33] <preference> e.g. if someone has already selected term 4, just change the default to the first child of term 4?
[09:54:00] <Cork> preference: i _think_ the want is to have the default be "choose an option (the first)" but when the dropdown is expanded have it show the bottom of the dropdown
[09:54:03] <JuJUBee> preference, I am currently working on that solution.  I was looking to see if there was a different way
[09:54:36] <JuJUBee> I also need to set session vars so first child is the "selected" class ID so gradebook etc. displays for that child
[09:54:39] <preference> right
[09:54:51] <Cork> i kinda excluded the set default selection as an option cause of that assumption
[10:12:32] <asasasas> join #jQuery
[10:12:45] <asasasas> need help
[10:13:26] <preference> you're in the jquery channel
[10:13:30] <preference> not anymore though
[10:13:38] <Cork> :)
[10:19:15] <JuJUBee> OK, got the selection working as desired.  Is there a way to move the selected item to the top of the scroll window now?
[11:25:40] <MacroMan> Does $(window).on('load', fn) really fire when everything is loaded? I'm having an issue where image offset is not correct during the callback.
[11:26:23] <MacroMan> Also, I do get the correct dimensions after a small 50ms timeout during onload.
[11:27:00] <MacroMan> So onload seems to fire before I can get the correct dimensions. I don't want to rely on a timeout. What else can I do?
[12:20:12] <jak2000> hi all
[12:21:00] <jak2000> in a <input type='file'     how to ckeck if user selected a File?
[12:40:11] <preference> jak2000: on input change
[14:19:19] <rwb> Does anyone know if DataTables plugin works with Ajax bringing in only part of the table at a time?  I would like to use its pagenation features, but the client side would need to know the overall total number of rows, while the ajax only brings in a few at a time.
[14:20:17] <robertmaxrees> rwb you mean it needs the number to setup pagination?
[14:21:00] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/server_side this seems relevant.
[14:21:22] <rwb> Right, if the database has 1000 rows, the total would need to be known but the Ajax would only bring in say 10 at a time...
[14:21:56] <robertmaxrees> ^ that example should help?
[14:22:02] <rwb> Thanks @robertm
[14:24:25] <Rockwood> what is meaning of ajax response debug field ?
[14:27:58] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, can you help me in understand this ?
[15:39:12] <Levin^> hello
[15:39:13] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qYpQPN?editors=1010
[15:39:27] <Levin^> further instructions inside my link
[15:39:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:39:42] <Levin^> what I need it to do is:
[15:40:31] <Levin^> my code is a mess, because I don't know how to merge the repeated code into something less lenghty
[15:41:00] <Levin^> second, I think the scrolling that the menu is havving are not working as it should
[16:18:28] <Levin^> :(
[16:45:04] <catbadger> afternoon y'all
[16:45:21] <robertmaxrees> sup catbadger
[16:46:04] <catbadger> namuch robertmaxrees, just here to ask questions as per usual...
[16:46:05] <catbadger> i'm testing widgets and i want to automate mousedown/mouseup instead of click but it needs to be at specific x,y coordinates.
[16:46:36] <catbadger> is there a way to simulate moving the mouse to a specific spot and mousedown, mouse up seperately to trigger specific handlers?
[16:47:17] <robertmaxrees> weeelllll you could, but I would approach that problem a little bit differently if you can.
[16:47:57] <catbadger> how so?
[16:48:27] <robertmaxrees> i would split that into two different kinds of tests - unit tests and integration tests.
[16:48:44] <catbadger> yeah... the integration test still needs this
[16:48:55] <robertmaxrees> hummm.
[16:49:03] <robertmaxrees> what are you using for testing?]
[16:49:07] <catbadger> qunit
[16:49:13] <catbadger> lol
[16:49:34] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:49:39] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:49:51] <robertmaxrees> so you'd want a different testing system altogether for that kind of test.
[16:49:54] <robertmaxrees> qunit is for unit tests.
[16:50:45] <catbadger> i understand that. I'm using async asserts for integration testing of a kitchen sink page with all our widgets.
[16:50:58] <robertmaxrees> what i'm saying is you don'
[16:51:07] <robertmaxrees> *don't want to use qunit for this particular test.
[16:51:14] <robertmaxrees> since you can't effectively actually emulate a mouse.
[16:51:27] <catbadger> ...
[16:51:34] <catbadger> nothing effectively emulates a mouse
[16:51:40] <robertmaxrees> not true :)
[16:51:43] <robertmaxrees> selenium
[16:51:45] <catbadger> we also use selenium for that, which is garbage
[16:51:57] <robertmaxrees> actually selenium is great for exactly that job.
[16:52:22] <catbadger> no
[16:52:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:52:26] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:52:29] <catbadger> selenium is great for trival applications
[16:52:41] <robertmaxrees> and complex ones where you'd like to automate your functional testing.
[16:53:20] <catbadger> we do that. the boss wants qunit tests for the widgets.
[16:53:48] <robertmaxrees> then write unit tests.  the only issue is that you're trying to simulate a mouse click.
[16:53:54] <robertmaxrees> on a specific x,y
[16:54:09] <catbadger> well it's on a widget that wraps jq-ui-colorpicker
[16:54:29] <robertmaxrees> wait are you trying to write unit tests for things done via jquery ui?
[16:54:30] <catbadger> i need the down and up events to trigger half-way across a div
[16:54:47] <catbadger> and the unit test is for our wrappeer
[16:54:52] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:55:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd rethink the strategy in this case since qunit's not really meant to do that but (shrug)
[16:55:40] <catbadger> i probably don't need to test the selection by mouse events then
[16:56:03] <catbadger> hrmmmm
[16:56:28] <catbadger> thank you
[17:34:27] <Levin^> hmm, trying again
[17:34:28] <Levin^> hello
[17:34:41] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ part of your issue is you're asking about two disparate issues at once.
[17:34:50] <robertmaxrees> try breaking it down into one problem at a time.
[17:34:54] <Levin^> ok
[17:34:58] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried to solve the problem.
[17:36:22] <Levin^> I didn't find a way on mergind the code to make it less lenghty yet
[17:46:58] <robertmaxrees> so which problem do you want to tackle first?
[17:50:51] <Levin^> the first one
[17:51:01] <robertmaxrees> which?
[17:51:15] <Levin^> a way to minify my code
[17:51:15] <robertmaxrees> (sorry, don't have the codepen open at the moment)
[17:51:23] <robertmaxrees> oh, abstraction
[17:51:24] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:51:37] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/YLYdza?editors=1011
[17:51:44] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you want to abstract your stuff
[17:51:47] <robertmaxrees> not minify it.
[17:51:52] <Levin^> hm yes
[17:52:45] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so looking at your code, what actually makes each new Waypoint different?
[17:54:38] <Levin^> getElementById and the number at the end of the $("")
[17:55:01] <Levin^> they all have equivalent numbers, to match the element on html
[17:55:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:55:14] <Levin^> they are seven in total
[17:55:26] <robertmaxrees> (the number of them are irrelevant) ;)
[17:55:35] <Levin^> hm
[17:55:38] <robertmaxrees> so.
[17:55:59] <robertmaxrees> you could do this a few ways.
[17:56:05] <Levin^> in my real code, each element have an unique name
[17:56:21] <robertmaxrees> you mean a unique class?
[17:56:38] <Levin^> if you think of serializing, it wouldn't work on my scenario
[17:56:40] <Levin^> yes
[17:56:50] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:56:55] <robertmaxrees> "serializing"?
[17:57:13] <Levin^> using the numbers in some automatic detection
[17:58:02] <robertmaxrees> well.
[17:58:11] <robertmaxrees> you're going to need to make some changes to your markup.
[17:59:12] <Levin^> I thought on making it easier to look, but ok
[18:00:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:00:38] <robertmaxrees> "making it easier to look"?
[18:00:48] <Levin^> title 1, title 2, etc
[18:01:01] <Levin^> I could change to title one, title two, etc
[18:01:01] <robertmaxrees> so you're misusing classes :)
[18:01:14] <Levin^> so they're unique
[18:01:19] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:01:22] <robertmaxrees> classes aren't meant to be unique.
[18:01:28] <robertmaxrees> for the menu-titles, for instance, you want class="menu-item"
[18:01:41] <robertmaxrees> and then add a data attribute that's something like data-item-number="1"
[18:01:48] <Levin^> hm
[18:02:00] <robertmaxrees> err, menu items
[18:02:34] <robertmaxrees> your divs with titles then become div class="title"
[18:02:48] <robertmaxrees> then add a data attribute data-title-number="1" or w/e
[18:03:38] <Levin^> ok
[18:05:29] <robertmaxrees> imakewebthings.com/waypoints/guides/jquery-zepto/#fn-extension
[18:05:31] <robertmaxrees> and then you can use this.
[18:07:39] <Levin^> to make multiple waypoints?
[18:08:27] <Levin^> hmm
[18:25:03] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, now you can just select all those waypoints with one selector and then .each() through them to init.,
[18:26:37] <Levin^> hmm
[18:26:40] <Levin^> good idea
[18:28:33] <Levin^> can I set variables outside the functions, then call them inside?
[18:28:58] <robertmaxrees> sure - but why? :)
[18:29:16] <robertmaxrees> there were a few selectors you could save and then .filter() down.
[18:29:31] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:34:43] <Levin^> ok
[18:34:46] <Levin^> hmm I need to go
[18:34:49] <Levin^> thanks
[20:27:02] <jak2000> hi all
[20:27:07] <jak2000> anyone used moment?
[21:44:14] <Rockwood> i am unable to ajax error in -->     .fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus, error) {        console.log("Post error: " + error);    });
[21:44:32] <Rockwood> in console.log
[21:47:30] <Rockwood> .fail(response => {console.log(response)})  it should be the same as above
[21:56:42] <Rockwood> is the right .fail(response => {console.log(response,textStatus, error)} ?
