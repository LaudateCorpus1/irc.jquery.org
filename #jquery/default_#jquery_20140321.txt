[00:04:04] <rdarshan> hi
[00:04:26] <rdarshan> is anybody know how to enable wrap in select option tag
[00:37:30] <Abbbbbbhi> hi
[00:37:55] <beancurd> sup!
[00:40:41] <Abbbbbbhi> Hi bean , quick question I am trying to set height of <html> inside frame using  _frame.contentDocument.documentElement.offsetHeight = 20 +"px" but it is not setting . It is taking a different value
[00:40:48] <Abbbbbbhi> iframe is under a div tag
[00:43:50] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: are you trying to set the height of the iframe or the document in the iframe?
[00:47:26] <Abbbbbbhi> Cork , see this http://imgur.com/LvemVLU I want the height to be adjusted with respective to the text
[00:48:02] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: then you want to set the height of the iframe to the height of the document inside it
[00:48:06] <Cork> not set the document height
[00:48:32] <Abbbbbbhi> yes
[00:49:49] <Abbbbbbhi> for that i am doing  - this._frame.contentDocument.body.style.height = this._frame.contentDocument.body.firstChild.offsetHeight + "px" ;
[00:49:51] <Abbbbbbhi> 		this._frame.style.height = this._frame.contentDocument.body.style.height + "px";
[00:50:07] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: that sets the height of the content, not the iframe
[00:50:56] <Cork> you want something like this._frame.height = this._frame.contentWindow.body.scrollHeight;
[00:51:43] <Cork> opps missed the + 'px' at the end
[00:58:49] <Abbbbbbhi> yaa and this._frame.contentWindow.document.body you missed document
[00:59:22] <Cork> sorry i'm a bit out of it today
[00:59:32] <Cork> had jour tonight
[01:06:49] <Abbbbbbhi> np
[01:07:22] <Abbbbbbhi> when can you set height of element ? after adding to dom or before using Js?
[01:19:35] <Shadur> I'm trying to set up a handler that intercepts the submit event on all forms on the page (lot of different forms, long story) but $('form').submit() doesn't seem to be working.
[01:20:00] <Shadur> http://pastebin.com/e01mrP1x <-- The alert never gets called. Neither does the breakpoint I inserted in front of that in the javascript console.
[01:26:16] <ns5> I see many $.get() and $.ajax() examples where url is just '/test.html', how does jquery know the server address?
[01:27:16] <Shadur> ns5: Presumably, the same way the browser knows it when an image links to <img src='images/something.jpg'>
[01:28:29] <ns5> Shadur: I am using jquery mobile in an mobile app, there is no browser, just direct $.get(), I guess server address should always be included in url?
[01:31:27] <Shadur> Probably. If an URL doesn't start with a protocol designator it's assumed to be relative to the current client location.
[01:50:08] <murosai_> is the result of a = $(selector) a "dynamic" or "static", that is if the dom element changes then so does a?
[01:59:43] <Cork> murosai_: a is an array like list of the elements selector matched
[02:00:02] <Cork> murosai_: so what was put in the array is what is there
[02:29:48] <anli_> When I add a style in firebug for an element, it dissapears after 1 second, why?
[02:32:16] <Cork> anli_: sounds like something updates/replaces the elements on a timer
[02:32:40] <anli_> Well, thats something one would expect, but I dont have such a timer...
[02:33:05] <sahbeewah> anli_, you're probably adding an invalid style
[02:33:32] <anli_> Thats also something one could expect, but it is valid
[02:33:42] <anli_> And why is there non error message if I try to do that...
[02:33:56] <Cork> it wouldn't get removed after a time if it was invalid
[02:34:02] <Cork> it would never be entered
[02:34:18] <anli_> I have read other people wondering why they dissapeared after a time and they were inputting invalid rules, if I get it right
[02:34:30] <anli_> ok Cork, I take your word for it
[02:34:36] <sahbeewah> i just replicated it on firefox, debian, disappears after 1  second
[02:34:39] <sahbeewah> i don't use ff normally
[02:34:48] <Cork> anli_: the element exist until you move focus in firebug
[02:34:59] <anli_> I entered bla: 24, and it were there for a second
[02:35:17] <Cork> are you talking about editing the attribute
[02:35:23] <Cork> or changing style?
[02:35:41] <Cork> the later is what i talked about
[02:36:27] <anli_> I tried to input width: 24px, the div reflected the width, I pressed outside the firebug css editor, the rule were there for a second, then dissapeared, however, the reflected with stays 24 in the browser window
[02:36:40] <Cork> anli_: do you have a link to the page?
[02:36:47] <anli_> Oh, its local
[02:36:56] <anli_> Wait, it is not
[02:37:00] <anli_> http://2.anders.v3net-dev.100procent.com/blogg/2013/december/13edecember
[02:37:18] <anli_> Can you see it?
[02:37:27] <Cork> yes
[02:37:32] <Cork> what element are you updating?
[02:37:43] <anli_> Make the window go small in width
[02:37:50] <anli_> Unwiden the window?
[02:37:51] <anli_> heh
[02:38:03] <anli_> You see a picture of an eagle, right
[02:38:13] <Cork> ya
[02:38:20] <anli_> There is also a div element that encloses the content
[02:38:26] <anli_> It has no attributes
[02:38:35] <anli_> It however has a style
[02:38:41] <anli_> element.style is black
[02:38:49] <anli_> eh, you know what I mean...
[02:38:53] <anli_> I try to make it width: 100%
[02:38:58] <Cork> ya, i just set width: 24px
[02:39:01] <Cork> ah
[02:39:19] <anli_> If you hover that div, you see that the image goes outside it
[02:39:21] <Cork> ok, done?
[02:39:24] <anli_> If you hover the div in firebug
[02:39:37] <anli_> So I try to make something to keep the contents within the div
[02:39:50] <Cork> just changed the image to 100%
[02:40:03] <anli_> Thats only appropriate for wide images
[02:40:33] <Cork> i meant as far as i can tell it works
[02:40:39] <Cork> where is the problem
[02:40:48] <anli_> Hm, wonder if thats why the text content goes wider than the screen on an ipad
[02:40:54] <anli_> Thats the problem
[02:40:58] <anli_> Because of the image maybe
[02:41:15] <Cork> if a parent has overflow ya
[02:41:15] <anli_> On the ipad, the image is adapted to the screen, it seems
[02:41:40] <anli_> The parent does not have overflow
[02:41:52] <Cork> well the part about the style getting reset was what i was trying to look at
[02:41:56] <Cork> and can't reproduce it
[02:41:57] <anli_> Maybe I only need to set the max-width of 100% on the parent
[02:42:05] <anli_> Aha
[02:42:13] <anli_> Maybe you have a newer firebug than I have then
[02:42:25] <anli_> I am running 1.12.7
[02:42:34] <Cork> same
[02:42:48] <anli_> Hm
[02:43:00] <anli_> Wonder what happens if I set max-width to 100% on the img
[02:43:25] <anli_> It narrows down, however, I am not sure aspect ratio is preserved
[02:43:38] <anli_> firebug keeps the style
[02:43:42] <anli_> Thats cool
[02:44:13] <anli_> Oh, the aspect ratio is not preserved, if I set the max-width to 20%, I can see it is not
[02:44:15] <Cork> anli_: ratio is preserved if you set one of the two dimensions of the image
[02:44:18] <anli_> yeah
[02:44:31] <anli_> Well well, I try this myself of you have to sent me a bill :)
[02:44:33] <Cork> just remove the height of the element and it should work
[02:44:40] <anli_> Cant do that
[02:44:45] <Cork> why?
[02:44:53] <anli_> Hm
[02:45:12] <anli_> Maybe I can
[02:45:20] <Cork> i can see if you want a media query checking for aspect of the screen
[02:45:30] <Cork> and use either width or height depending on the device
[02:45:44] <Cork> but i can't see why you have to set both all the time
[02:45:56] <anli_> Well, true
[02:46:23] <krambiorix> hi , i want to validate a string like [year(4 numbers)]-[number (1 to 5 digits)]... ANyone?
[02:47:03] <Shadur> Okay, going slightly mad. I'm setting up a submit handler for forms that checks if the custom attribute of "confirm" and/or "validate" are present, but javascript throws a TypeError exception saying it's undefined.
[02:47:27] <Cork> krambiorix: /^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{1.5}$/
[02:47:31] <Shadur> http://pastebin.com/6ibCreFs <-- The alert says something along the lines of HTMLFormObject, but when I ask for the attribute it throws a fit.
[02:48:37] <krambiorix> Cork , thanks again!
[02:48:47] <anli_> Cork++
[02:49:01] <Cork> shadda: attribute isn't a property of elements
[02:49:09] <Cork> attributes is and getAttribute is
[02:49:52] <Cork> shadda: also you prob want to use data-confirm and the like instead of confirm
[02:50:00] <Cork> so you don't conflict it future specs
[02:50:14] <Cork> *conflict with
[02:50:39] <Cork> *Shadur:
[02:50:44] <Cork> >_<''
[02:51:35] <Cork> Shadur: you got that?
[02:51:55] <fabioportieri> good morning and happy friday everyone
[02:52:11] <Uhkis> good day
[02:55:17] <Shadur> ...Dur. Thanks, Cork.
[03:03:33] <krambiorix> Cork , THis should work :s http://jsfiddle.net/vNM9f/1/
[03:04:09] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/vNM9f/2/
[03:04:21] <Cork> did i type the dot in {1,5} ?
[03:05:36] <SprkDev> I've implemented modal bootstrap that works.
[03:06:04] <SprkDev> only one problem, the hidden modal is in the way and prevents click link. I can see its outline in firebug. How to fix?
[03:07:33] <krambiorix> Cork, thx
[03:09:41] <jamk> Morning, i am having trouble selecting a list item that's corresponding to a page.
[03:09:51] <jamk> I am using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17706469/using-server-side-includes-what-are-options-for-selecting-a-current-nav-element/17706697#17706697 the second answer.
[03:10:10] <jamk> However i keep getting: cannot call method 'removeClass' of null, can anyone help me with this?
[03:13:47] <SprkDev> Having a strange problem. Modal window works fine on first click. But when that modal closes and I try to do it again, it sees it as a direct link and wont show modal. why?
[03:15:00] <Cork> jamk: sounds like your running removeClass on something that isn't jquery
[03:15:21] <jamk> http://jsfiddle.net/LU69D/ its setup something like that
[03:15:27] <Cork> SprkDev: to little context, but it sounds like the event listener is removed between the two times
[03:15:42] <SprkDev> probably.
[03:16:42] <jamk> Cork: you were right, it's fixed now, thanks alot
[03:32:18] <patrio___> What's the best way to doSomething() when all deferreds in a list is either resolved/rejected
[03:32:42] <patrio___> when.always doesn't work since it will trigger on the first reject
[03:34:36] <Cork> ?api then
[03:34:36] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[03:34:57] <Cork> hmm no
[03:37:43] <Cork> patrio___: looks like you need to write your own $.when function
[03:38:09] <cronic> hello, does someone have a fullcalendar version wiht edit/view/add/save function? :( cant find a workin version with save option..
[03:38:25] <Cork> patrio___: it does fail( deferred.reject ) for fail and you need to change that to work the same way done is
[03:38:59] <Cork> patrio___: when isn't too long so it should be fairly simple to implement
[03:49:35] <patrio___> solved it in another way
[03:49:54] <lombrozo> How do I stack divs horizontally, but only once they have filled the available VERTICAL space?
[03:50:55] <Cork> lombrozo: there is no clean way to do this currently
[03:51:17] <Cork> lombrozo: they are looking at it for future css modules, but those aren't standard yet
[03:51:34] <lombrozo> Cork: so I'd need to implement it manually?
[03:51:40] <Cork> lombrozo: yes
[03:51:54] <Cork> like two separate divs, one for each column
[03:52:05] <Cork> and then move elements from the first div to the second one as needed
[03:52:31] <lombrozo> Cork: ok, thanks, think I understand
[03:53:55] <patrio___> Cork: I did this basically: var d = $.Deferred(); deferreds.push(d);               $.get("foo.bar").always(d.resolve)             and then $.when.apply(null, deferreds);
[03:54:01] <Cork> sigh i love ppl running away after a question...
[03:54:55] <Cork> patrio___: nice
[03:59:31] <cronic> does somebody knows a good calendar ?! with add/edit/save function without login process?
[04:10:42] <SprkDev> Somewhere here there is an unclosed brace or bracket but I can't find it. Its causing error. http://pastebin.com/F7sGB8zD
[04:12:47] <Cork> SprkDev: cause there isn't one in the code you linked
[04:12:57] <Cork> SprkDev: but why do you have .ready in a function call?
[04:13:11] <Cork> that doesn't really make sense
[04:13:20] <SprkDev> there isnt error?
[04:13:37] <Cork> what do you mean?
[04:14:16] <SprkDev> did you say you found error?
[04:14:31] <Cork> like i said, there isn't one in the code you linked
[04:14:54] <Cork> it is most likely something before the code you copied
[04:19:05] <SprkDev> might be here http://pastebin.com/jDFt75XT
[04:31:56] <inputLoad> hi, how can i recu
[04:31:59] <inputLoad> hi all
[04:32:02] <inputLoad> how to retrieve a given sql in my jquery load function?
[04:32:25] <Cork> inputLoad: you hopefully can't
[04:32:35] <Cork> cause that would mean your sql was exposed to the public web
[04:33:04] <Cork> (without or with a public user/password)
[04:33:30] <inputLoad> owww it's bad for me
[04:33:46] <Cork> inputLoad: what you can do is have a server script support specific requests
[04:33:57] <Cork> and it makes sql queries based on that
[04:34:04] <Cork> and sends ex. json back to the client
[04:34:13] <Cork> but DO NOT accept sql to the script
[04:34:27] <inputLoad> so how I can do for my load function displays a given my sql database?
[04:35:06] <inputLoad> I must seek the side of json?
[04:35:11] <Cork> $.getJSON(url, { q: "search value" }, function(json) {})
[04:35:27] <Cork> where url points to a server script that queries and build the response
[04:35:37] <Cork> inputLoad: or you search server side
[04:38:00] <inputLoad> ok so if I do not know the json, I must put all pure HTML? I can not because it is long
[04:38:26] <Cork> inputLoad: you have to generate a data response that client side can handle
[04:38:33] <Cork> how you choose to do that is up to you
[04:38:57] <Cork> all i talked about is how the request must be done to be remotely secure
[04:39:16] <inputLoad> if I stock my sql code in a variable and I ask the load function to display the result in my load function with conditions?
[04:39:38] <Cork> load function?
[04:39:48] <Cork> inputLoad: ok, lets back this up a little
[04:39:53] <Cork> are you talking about node.js?
[04:40:49] <Cork> if you arn't then you are on a different machine from the sql server so you need to create a protocol for the data to get from your server to the client
[04:43:09] <inputLoad> i don't know the json
[04:43:36] <Cork> "the json"?
[04:47:33] <inputLoad> yes json
[04:48:08] <inputLoad> i never coded in json
[04:48:26] <Cork> json is a transfer format, not a coding language
[04:48:35] <SprkDev> I can see the empty modal window for a few secs before the dom gets to load into modal window. How I fix this?
[04:48:37] <Cork> and it's just a way to structure the data
[04:48:47] <Cork> if you don't want to use json, use something else
[04:48:56] <slax0r> how can I get nth key and values from an object like this: https://gist.github.com/slax0rr/9684509
[04:49:23] <Cork> SprkDev: if the lib you use to create the window uses an iframe; not much you can do
[04:49:50] <SprkDev> it bootsrap modal
[04:50:03] <Cork> slax0r: obj["100"]
[04:50:17] <Cork> not sure what you mean nth in this case though
[04:50:57] <slax0r> Cork: no, like, "gimme key/value pair index 0, 1, 2 or 3
[04:51:21] <Cork> slacko_: $.each(obj, function(key, values) {})
[04:51:36] <cannap> hi when i use  wp_set_password($new_password, $user_id->ID); is there no return true or false?
[04:51:38] <slax0r> no other way? :/
[04:51:46] <cannap> sry wrong channel
[04:52:03] <Cork> slax0r: might be but i don't follow what you want
[04:52:22] <Cork> slax0r: objects has no index
[04:52:28] <Cork> only arrays has those
[04:52:39] <slax0r> oh man...shoot me then :/
[04:53:03] <inputLoad> use what? to display sql data without reloading my page?
[04:53:08] <Cork> so all you have is an object with an unknown number of keys
[04:53:13] <Cork> and each key has an array of values
[04:53:19] <slax0r> correct
[04:53:37] <Cork> and the only way to handle that is with a loop
[04:53:38] <slax0r> and I need to get the key and the values for position 2 i.e. in this object
[04:53:47] <Cork> there is no position 2
[04:54:02] <slax0r> yeah, I understand that now...
[04:54:22] <slax0r> I'll have to change the object creation :/
[04:54:28] <slax0r> oh well, back to the drawing board
[04:56:13] <Cork> slax0r: i would change the structure something like this http://jsfiddle.net/eVzPc/
[04:57:30] <Cork> or like this is also an option http://jsfiddle.net/eVzPc/1/
[05:00:20] <slax0r> Cork: yeah, I'm doing something like this
[05:11:51] <SprkDev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1403615/use-jquery-to-hide-a-div-when-the-user-clicks-outside-of-it
[05:12:07] <SprkDev> trying to fix this. Close window when clicked outside. it almost works.
[05:12:27] <SprkDev> only thing since I am using modal, when I click outside the modal goes away but the page remains faded.
[05:24:47] <walidvb> hi guys, I have an issue using a plugin called swiper
[05:26:23] <walidvb> I am trying to add a button within a slide, that listens to a click event and does smth
[05:26:24] <walidvb> http://cf.vbbros.net/sites/all/themes/angupal/app/index.html
[05:26:34] <walidvb> (those arrows at the bottom)
[05:26:49] <walidvb> but it seems the event is never triggered--
[05:30:06] <doberman> Is {method:"POST"} same as {type:"POST"} when using $.ajax() ? If not, what is the difference?
[05:31:09] <Cork> doberman: no
[05:31:21] <Cork> doberman: method:"" is just junk data in the option object
[05:31:35] <Cork> while type:"" sets what verb the connection should use
[05:31:58] <doberman> Then why does method:"" work just fine ? :)
[05:32:12] <Cork> doberman: if type isn't set it defaults to get
[05:32:45] <doberman> Cork: let me be specific. {method:"POST"} does POST, {method:"GET"} does GET, {method:"DELETE"} does DELETE request.
[05:33:09] <Cork> doberman: then you have a plugin that translates method to type
[05:33:15] <doberman> That's why I asked the question in first place, what is the difference between method and type.
[05:33:19] <Cork> cause ajax doesn't know what method is for an option
[05:33:44] <Cork> or your not using jquery ajax
[05:33:57] <doberman> Ok, let me set up jsfiddle.
[05:35:51] <Cork> doberman: correction
[05:36:10] <Cork> they apparently have added an alias since i last checked

[05:50:00] <woozly_> guys, how to get mouse position on document, when draggable?
[05:50:26] <woozly_> If I use: drag: function(e) { e.clientX and e.clientY it returns not what I need... // it seems to.
[05:52:36] <Cork> woozly_: it should be
[05:52:42] <Cork> woozly_: what's wrong with it?
[05:53:29] <joobie> hey guys.. i have something like <td><select><option></option></select><div class="baa"></div><div class="moo"></div></td> .. how can I select <div class="moo"></div> when the <select> within the <td> is selected?
[05:54:37] <Cork> joobie: $(this).siblings('.moo') ?
[05:54:52] <joobie> siblings
[05:54:52] <joobie> hehe
[05:54:55] <joobie> nice
[05:55:02] <joobie> is there .cousins() also?
[05:55:10] <Cork> heh no
[05:55:42] <Cork> you can do something like $(this).siblings('.sibling').find('.child')
[05:56:57] <woozly_> Cork: will it recalculate if I'll scroll page?
[05:57:01] <woozly_> maybe its' my fault
[05:57:14] <joobie> $(this).siblings("div.category1").style.display = 'block';
[05:57:16] <joobie> should this work?
[05:57:22] <Cork> no
[05:57:23] <joobie> i have set display = none in the inline style
[05:57:44] <Cork> joobie: $(this).siblings("div.category1").css('display', 'block');
[05:57:55] <Cork> or just call .hide()
[05:58:03] <Cork> /.show()
[05:58:38] <joobie> thanks Cork

[06:01:52] <Cork> Stav: you have to use XDomainRequest and you need to write a parser of the data sent from the client
[06:02:10] <Cork> Stav: cause DomainRequest is hardcoded to text/plain, so you can't send normal support form data
[06:02:39] <Cork> Stav: why would you want to send post from http to https??
[06:02:47] <Cork> your data is already at risk at that state
[06:02:54] <Stav> Cork, do you have any example to point me to? Any url for that? Would be much appreciated!
[06:03:16] <Cork> Stav: why would you want to send post from http to https?? <--
[06:03:17] <Stav> the webservice is on https same domain but different protocol
[06:03:36] <Stav> its already been implemented this way
[06:03:40] <Cork> you should most likely move the source to https too
[06:03:45] <Stav> and we use this webservice everywhere
[06:04:03] <woozly_> Cork: e.clientX and e.clientY - shows position on viewport/screen, not on document :(
[06:04:04] <Cork> cause if you send data from http, https is already pointless
[06:04:31] <Stav> is there a feasible solution though?
[06:04:36] <Stav> to overcome this issue?
[06:05:01] <Cork> Stav: well you need to implement a form data parser server side
[06:05:23] <Cork> or move the request to https where it should have been to start with
[06:05:26] <Stav> we already have such thing which works with $.post
[06:05:38] <Cork> Stav: no you most likely have cors
[06:05:43] <Cork> ie doesn't support that
[06:05:48] <woozly_> Cork: I've got it. pageX and pageY is what I need.
[06:05:49] <Stav> do i need a separate parser for XDomainRequest?
[06:06:00] <Cork> it uses XDomainRequest with forcing text/plain data
[06:06:03] <Cork> yes
[06:06:14] <Stav> right i see any example to do that?
[06:06:32] <Cork> Stav: normal post uses content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[06:06:41] <Stav> yes
[06:06:46] <Cork> Stav: ie XDomainRequest uses Content-Type: text/plain
[06:07:03] <Cork> so the default parsers server side, that are built into the languages won't work
[06:07:19] <Stav> i see thank you so much for the info
[06:07:57] <Cork> Stav: so if you want to implement it
[06:08:14] <Cork> you need to write a script that takes the text blob from the request body and parses it
[06:08:21] <Stav> the webservice is json
[06:08:26] <Cork> and you need to take care of all the xss and all things like that
[06:08:35] <Cork> Stav: for the requests too?
[06:08:59] <Cork> i'm talking about the request, not the response
[06:09:05] <Stav> that an ajax post to json webservice located on https
[06:09:31] <Cork> Stav: that doesn't answer my question
[06:09:48] <Cork> if the post data json, or normal encodings?
[06:09:58] <Stav> so what i do now is i take the posted values using jquery and send them to the webservice using $.post
[06:10:09] <Stav> its normal encoding
[06:10:17] <Cork> Stav: then you arn't using json
[06:10:25] <Cork> you using www-form-encoding
[06:10:29] <Stav> no im not
[06:10:43] <Cork> you can't send json with $.post
[06:10:56] <Stav> i know its not json im sending
[06:11:01] <Stav> its normal values
[06:11:01] <Cork> you need to use $.ajax and set the contenttype option
[06:11:11] <Cork> then you are using www-form-encoding
[06:11:15] <Stav> yes
[06:11:19] <Cork> T_T
[06:11:25] <Stav> it works with modern browsers like ff and chrome
[06:11:28] <Cork> why did you say "no im not" then...
[06:11:30] <Cork> yes
[06:11:32] <Stav> not ie 7/8/9
[06:11:54] <Cork> but XDomainRequest DOES NOT SUPPORT A-N-Y thing other then text/plain
[06:11:54] <Stav> so what i need to do is to get this to work with ie
[06:11:59] <Cork> so you can't send normal form data
[06:12:02] <Cork> only plain text
[06:12:10] <Cork> meaning you have a textblob server side
[06:12:14] <Cork> you need to manually parse
[06:12:28] <Stav> so what do you suggest i do, other than moving the website to https also
[06:12:42] <Cork> Stav: you would have to write a parser
[06:12:47] <Cork> that parses the text
[06:12:52] <Stav> on the https?
[06:12:57] <Cork> yes
[06:13:07] <Stav> any example with a url?
[06:13:10] <Stav> it would help
[06:13:11] <Cork> this is by design of XDomainRequest
[06:13:40] <Cork> goodle for libs for the language you use server side
[06:13:48] <Stav> i use php
[06:13:58] <Stav> what am i lookng for exactly?
[06:14:01] <Cork> ?g php parse XDomainRequest post
[06:14:01] <b-ot> Cork: XDomainRequest object for cross-sites Ajax - Xul.fr → http://www.xul.fr/ajax/xdomainrequest.php
[06:14:12] <Stav> thanks
[06:14:20] <Cork> not saying that is what you want
[06:14:30] <Cork> but something like that is what you need to look for
[06:14:42] <Stav> ok thank you
[06:14:52] <Cork> Stav: and also note that you need to be careful so the script doesn't expose you to remote injection and things like that
[06:15:03] <Cork> cause you get none of the languages default filters
[06:15:10] <Cork> though php doesn't give you many of those
[06:15:33] <Stav> thank you
[06:15:37] <Cork> np
[06:16:10] <hxm> i load a page and i do this jQuery('.user-hover-details').find('h5').find('a').text(); and it finds nothing, if i do in console jQuery('.user-hover-details'), then do jQuery('.user-hover-details').find('h5') and so on it appears the text
[06:16:18] <hxm> how can i do it automatically?
[06:16:50] <Cork> hxm: sounds like you need to wrap it in ready
[06:17:00] <Cork> hxm: also you can simplify that code a lot
[06:17:06] <hxm> how?
[06:17:12] <Cork> jQuery('.user-hover-details h5 a').text();
[06:17:33] <hxm> oh, what is this magic
[06:17:42] <Cork> hxm: not magic
[06:17:48] <Cork> it's normal css selectors
[06:18:14] <Cork> hxm: $() and $().find() is built around elm.querySelectorAll
[06:18:44] <Cork> and that is a dom implementation for finding elements based on normal css selectors
[06:19:30] <hxm> ah, understood
[06:19:48] <hxm> anyway i have the same problem, maybe because .user-hover-details is in another div?
[06:20:31] <Cork> hxm: do you know how css selectors work?
[06:20:33] <VectorX> i got a <button> what do i need to put in the click function to stop it from submiting a form ?
[06:20:46] <hxm> not really, barely i dont know what i am doing
[06:20:50] <Cork> VectorX: <button type="button">
[06:20:57] <hxm> i think im going to read about css selectors
[06:20:59] <Cork> VectorX: if it isn't a submit button
[06:21:15] <Cork> VectorX: if it is a submit button handle the submit event on the form
[06:21:42] <VectorX> i think that did it
[06:23:36] <VectorX> so i got this checkbox(<input>) controled by a <button> its hsowing on the form, whats the best way to hide the checkbox ?
[06:24:09] <Cork> VectorX: several options
[06:24:19] <Cork> VectorX: depending on what should cause the hiding
[06:24:31] <Cork> VectorX: if it is a state of the form i would set a class on the form
[06:24:37] <Cork> and let the class hide the checkbox
[06:25:17] <VectorX> im basically setting the value of the cb when the button is pressed, so i dont need to display the cb on the form just need it when submiting
[06:25:53] <Cork> VectorX: then why not just use <input type="hidden"> ?
[06:26:51] <VectorX> well its <input type="checkbox"> atm, coz the value expected is what it generated
[06:27:04] <Cork> ah
[06:27:21] <Cork> well then you can either set a class on it with a simple display: none
[06:27:24] <Cork> or set it inline
[06:27:43] <Cork> or run .hide() on it if you want it in js
[06:29:52] <VectorX> ill try that, i thought display none would stop it from working, but ill give it shot
[06:30:03] <Stav> Cork?
[06:30:14] <Stav> I have tried the xdr.contentType = "text/plain";
[06:30:25] <Stav> and i get access denied in ie8
[06:30:38] <Stav> it doesnt open the connection to the webservice url
[06:30:47] <Cork> Stav: i think you've mixed up what i said a bit
[06:31:10] <Cork> Stav: in ie, if you want to make ajax calls cross domain you MUST use XDomainRequest
[06:31:19] <Stav> yes i am
[06:31:25] <Cork> XMLHttpRequest won't work
[06:31:36] <Cork> XDomainRequest can only post data as text/plain
[06:31:37] <Stav> im using xdomainrequest
[06:31:46] <Cork> setting contenttype won't work
[06:31:49] <Stav> its not posting the data
[06:31:52] <Stav> thats the issue
[06:31:54] <Cork> it is locked to text/plain
[06:32:03] <Cork> Stav: it is, as text
[06:32:10] <Stav> i get scripted denied error message because im posting from http to https
[06:32:35] <Cork> ya, XDomainRequest is for full cross domain
[06:32:48] <Cork> not sure if it allows from insecure to secure
[06:32:56] <Stav> SCRIPT5: Access is denied.
[06:33:10] <Cork> haven't looked that hard into XDomainRequest as i see it as pointless
[06:33:41] <Stav> ok so it doesnt support it then what can i do to make this happen?
[06:34:01] <Cork> allow http and https to the webservice?
[06:34:22] <Stav> i am allowing this
[06:34:32] <Cork> then why do you need to post to https?
[06:34:32] <Stav> by setting the header on the server side
[06:34:37] <Cork> no
[06:34:42] <Cork> your thinking cors again
[06:34:52] <Cork> and like i've said over and over again
[06:34:55] <Cork> ie doesn't support cors
[06:35:03] <Cork> until ie10 that is
[06:35:15] <Stav> so there is no solution basically
[06:35:22] <Stav> for anything under ie10
[06:35:33] <Cork> not if you can't hack around it with XDomainRequest
[06:35:56] <Cork> you would have to allow the webservice to get http post
[06:36:13] <Stav> http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx point 7 says cannot be done
[06:36:14] <Cork> meaning posts to http://domain.com/webservice
[06:36:24] <Stav> i am allowing in
[06:36:29] <Stav> on both http and https
[06:36:34] <hxm> Cork, i simply have this $( document ).ready(function() { tech = jQuery('.user-hover-details h5 a').text(); alert(tech); } and the alert is empty just when load the page, what do i miss?
[06:37:07] <Cork> hxm: are you loading the section through ajax?
[06:37:11] <hxm> no
[06:37:17] <hxm> is the normal page
[06:37:23] <Cork> then ... it should work
[06:37:35] <hxm> ah, is a chrome extension, could be it loads before than the page?
[06:38:01] <Cork> hxm: extensions normally trigger on content loaded
[06:38:14] <Cork> hxm: so ya that could cause it
[06:38:24] <Cork> hxm: you could try using $(document).load instead of ready
[06:38:34] <hxm> ok
[06:47:22] <Thaifood> hi
[06:48:16] <Thaifood> Is jquery mobile used with jquery or instead of jquery ?
[06:50:45] <ankurk_> Thaifood: With jQuery
[06:51:48] <Thaifood> ankurk_,  thanks so with a responsive design, i can just use jquery and then when i need more mobile features just add in jquery mobile ?
[06:52:27] <ankurk_> I think you would have to include it everytime.
[06:53:25] <Thaifood> ankurk_:  i'm using bootstrap and it is currently responsive with jquery alone
[06:53:46] <Thaifood> so when i need to make more mobile functions then i can add it to my site
[06:54:09] <Thaifood> is this the channel for mobile too or is there another irc channel?
[06:55:15] <ankurk_> Thaifood: you can ask questions about mobile too
[06:55:23] <decx> strangely enough jq mobile is not as plug it in solution for mobile stuff but specifically for mobile only sites as it requires a bunch of ridiculous markup for behaviour
[06:55:57] <ankurk_> decx: to be honest, I hate jq mobile
[06:56:05] <decx> now you might ask yourself, why would i want to include jquery and jquery mobile on a site that relies on low latency
[06:56:45] <ankurk_> yeah, better to create something on your own
[06:56:48] <Thaifood> decx, so if i write a site for desktop, laptop, tablet and phone using bootstrap,  would i use jquery mobile too ?
[06:56:50] <decx> i don't hate it, it just doesnt make sense to me
[06:57:19] <decx> don't think of it as jquery on mobile, but more something like jquery ui for mobile
[06:57:43] <Cork> ya
[06:57:53] <Cork> jqm is mainly ui oriented
[06:58:07] <Cork> my biggest problem with it is that it is exclusively js oriented
[06:58:27] <Thaifood> i'm still not clear on when i would use it
[06:58:28] <Cork> the site doesn't work at all if the visitor doens't have js on
[06:59:01] <Cork> and that is a construction failure in my point of view
[06:59:06] <decx> you use it when you don'T have the ressources to build a mobile app from scratch
[06:59:20] <Thaifood> i expect every site to have js and if not DENIED
[06:59:56] <Cork> Thaifood: to get ex. contact information for the site?
[06:59:59] <decx> yes, not working without js is against my principles of graceful degradation as well
[07:00:01] <Cork> or things like that?
[07:00:14] <Cork> i don't mean it should all work
[07:00:22] <Cork> but you should have some kind of page without js
[07:00:31] <Cork> you get a blank white page with jqm
[07:00:35] <Thaifood> nah, just tell them to go away or get JS
[07:00:46] <arschmitz> cork: jquery mobile works without js
[07:01:02] <arschmitz> cork: its called c grade and gives css only
[07:01:34] <Thaifood> So is the argument that since phone bandwidth is slow that jquery mobile is too big to be used ?
[07:01:36] <arschmitz> Cork: jquery mobiles whole concept is based around graceful degradation
[07:02:08] <Cork> arschmitz: then they have changed that since 1.8
[07:02:25] <arschmitz> Cork: no thats not new and its only at 1.4 there is no 1.8
[07:02:29] <Thaifood> Version 1.4.2
[07:02:34] <Cork> cause most of the code back then was written in a way where you didn't have any fallback
[07:02:51] <arschmitz> cork: http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/1.4/
[07:02:53] <Cork> heck large parts of it was even hard to get working cause of how jqm demanded it to be
[07:03:19] <Cork> arschmitz: ok, i looked close at it about a year back
[07:03:29] <arschmitz> cork: it did change a lot in last 2 versions but this is not new this is since 1.0
[07:03:30] <Cork> and many of the features it gave broke without js
[07:03:36] <Thaifood> Cork:  sounds like a lot has changed
[07:03:39] <Cork> and you would have to basically have a none js site as it demanded it
[07:03:45] <arschmitz> cork: will of course most features wont work with out js
[07:04:14] <Cork> arschmitz: i meant to the point that basic concepts was hard to implement
[07:04:16] <arschmitz> its css only at that point there is not much you can do on an old browser with only css2
[07:04:36] <Cork> arschmitz: i'm not talking about old browsers
[07:05:15] <arschmitz> Cork: but you have to assume it because without js you have no idea whats supported
[07:05:21] <decx> imho, responsive won the battle and if you have to have a separate mobile site it should have an extremely small footprint
[07:05:27] <Cork> true
[07:06:01] <arschmitz> decx: jquery mobile is not seperate from responsive you can make desktop sites in it too it is not really mobile specific
[07:06:05] <Thaifood> decx but with responsive design don't i still need jqm ?
[07:06:25] <arschmitz> im not trying to say jquery mobile is a great solution for every one at all
[07:06:35] <Thaifood> it's just when i am at the media query for the mobile size that I would use jqm for all the touchy things yes ?
[07:06:38] <arschmitz> but it does gracefully degrade and is responsive
[07:06:39] <decx> its design principles are too overbearing for my purposes,
[07:06:49] <arschmitz> decx: and thats fine its not for everyone
[07:07:05] <arschmitz> decx: though i think you would find much of that changed in 1.4 if you have not looked at it
[07:07:17] <decx> like i wrote earlier, if you don'T have the resources to build a mobile centric app from scratch it's probably a good starting point
[07:07:38] <Thaifood> jquery.mobile-1.4.2.min.js is 191k and jquery.mobile-1.4.2.css is 232k  FAT yes ?
[07:08:21] <decx> wait what
[07:08:23] <decx> really?
[07:08:30] <Thaifood> http://jquerymobile.com/download/
[07:08:34] <Thaifood> check it out
[07:09:06] <Thaifood> ahh css min is 202kb
[07:09:13] <decx> 65k gzipped wow
[07:09:38] <Thaifood> that's alot right ?
[07:09:46] <arschmitz> well you should never use the full library
[07:09:49] <decx> on mobile it is
[07:09:56] <arschmitz> you should be using a custom build
[07:10:37] <arschmitz> and there is a often a 50-80% size difference
[07:11:22] <Thaifood> that makes sense
[07:11:42] <arschmitz> you will never use all the widgets and all the features all the transitions etc in a single page or app or your ui would probably be pretty crazy
[07:11:48] <Thaifood> for me who knows nothing about mobile design jqm seems a great starting point
[07:11:52] <decx> wow that download builder has a lot of options
[07:11:54] <Thaifood> http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[07:11:57] <Thaifood> yeah it does
[07:12:10] <arschmitz> yup we try to make it so you can get only what you want
[07:12:21] <Thaifood> that's very important
[07:13:03] <Thaifood> ok back to work.....i have to find a good way for identity proofing for users logging into insurance and financial data
[07:13:20] <Thaifood> jquery got anything for that ?
[07:13:47] <NoiseEee> Thaifood: that is a backend operation.
[07:14:07] <Thaifood> good point
[07:16:09] <ruby_on_tails> I am appending some html content loaded via ajax which contains a script tag as well, how do I execute that script tag?
[07:16:17] <ruby_on_tails> I can't see it in the dom when the injection takes place
[07:16:53] <decx> you don't, you get the script separately with getscript
[07:18:46] <ruby_on_tails> decx: the script comes with the html, there is no other way
[07:21:29] <anli_> I need to measure the height of a div, however, the images in it are not fully loaded, is there some event I can use to re-measure when images are fully loaded?
[07:21:45] <NoiseEee> anli_: images have .load events
[07:22:14] <anli_> NoiseEee: If I use .load() on an img, will I receive a callback even if the image is loaded already?
[07:22:41] <dwarder> how do i make it work $("input[name=my[name]]").val()
[07:22:45] <dwarder> ?
[07:22:49] <NoiseEee> i dont think so anli_
[07:23:04] <anli_> What is the name of the inputs you want to match?
[07:23:05] <dwarder> <imput name='my[name]'
[07:23:15] <anli_> lol @ imput
[07:23:22] <dwarder> <imput name='my[name]'>
[07:24:06] <Cork> dwarder: $("input[name='my[name]']").val()
[07:24:07] <anli_> hm, maybe you must escape those []:s in the selector
[07:24:12] <drej> $(
[07:24:14] <drej> imput
[07:24:18] <anli_> I did not know [ and ] were even allowed in names
[07:24:21] <Cork> ALWEAYS quote attribute values
[07:24:42] <Cork> anli_: you don't have to
[07:24:49] <anli_> Ah
[07:24:50] <Cork> just quote the values
[07:24:52] <SprkDev> why does the headers div dissapear when the modal loads?
[07:24:56] <SprkDev> its boostrap modal btw
[07:25:12] <anli_> Listen @ Cork, use '':s around my[name]
[07:25:33] <dwarder> Cork: thank you
[07:25:50] <Cork> i always use single quotes in js so i normally write it $(input[name="my[name]"]').val()
[07:25:53] <Cork> but same same :)
[07:26:24] <dwarder> :)
[07:28:09] <anli_> $('img').load(on_document_length_changed); seemed to not be sufficient
[07:28:22] <decx> ruby_on_tails i guess you can filter your script tag from your response data and append that
[07:28:41] <Cork> anli_: you can't attach them on page start
[07:28:48] <Cork> cause you risk missing the loading of the image
[07:29:21] <anli_> I have to init that event handler before loading starts?
[07:29:27] <Cork> anli_: it this on page load
[07:29:30] <Cork> or from ajax load?
[07:29:37] <anli_> Both actually
[07:29:50] <nerder_> hello everybody
[07:29:52] <Cork> well page load is just waiting for $(document).load()
[07:29:57] <anli_> I have an infinity listing and when the user scrolls down, the document is added to
[07:30:11] <Cork> anli_: and for ajax you need to attach the event listener before you add the content to the page
[07:30:14] <anli_> Will $(document).load() occur when images are loaded?
[07:30:19] <Cork> yes
[07:30:24] <anli_> Must try it
[07:30:36] <Cork> that is one of the big differences between .load and .ready
[07:30:50] <nerder_> i have a probelm with jquery .fadeIn() i dnt get why it works in this way
[07:30:51] <nerder_> http://jsfiddle.net/sMyfT/174/
[07:31:01] <anli_> Hm, doesnt seem to happen, strange
[07:31:23] <anli_> Oh, I modified the wrong code
[07:31:26] <anli_> Classic
[07:31:50] <nerder_> fadeOut instead works perfectly, with fadeIn the element blinking one time and after that use the fadeIn()
[07:32:05] <webguy02_> is there a way to get error response codes (other than 404) when using CORS? seems like none of the original headers are available on an error response.
[07:32:35] <decx> nerder use scrolltop on window not document
[07:33:56] <anli_> $(document).load(on_document_length_changed); does not occur, even if I clean the cache first
[07:34:27] <nerder_> decx: is the same
[07:34:33] <nerder_> *it's
[07:35:01] <SprkDev> is there a way to simply add a close button to the modal? bootstrap
[07:36:14] <Thaifood> SprkDev: http://www.bootply.com/123691
[07:37:41] <Thaifood> SprkDev:  that has a close button
[07:37:56] <anli_> Cork: Seems to be $(window).load()
[07:38:11] <SprkDev> I've done the same thing but the header dissapears for some reason when the external dom loads. Along with it goes the close button.
[07:38:17] <Cork> hmm i think document should work too
[07:38:28] <Cork> anli_: might be browser specific
[07:38:28] <anli_> Seems to not trigger
[07:38:31] <anli_> Ah
[07:38:37] <anli_> I hope I do not need both then
[07:38:53] <Thaifood> SprkDev: then the problem is in your code because you can see it does work
[07:38:53] <Cork> they are a bit inconsistent there
[07:39:00] <Cork> anli_: no i don't think so
[07:39:08] <Qantourisc> $.post({url:"test'}) is producing POST http://localhost/current_dir/%5object%20Object%5D what did I miss ?
[07:39:25] <sunbeam> I want to get the .first() h1 h2 h3 etc (basically any heading)
[07:39:29] <sunbeam> for a certain div
[07:39:32] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[07:39:44] <Cork> Qantourisc: $.post("test"
[07:39:56] <Qantourisc> ow, ok :p oepsy
[07:40:05] <Cork> Qantourisc: first argument should be the url
[07:40:16] <Cork> second is the data you want to post
[07:41:03] <ankurk_> sunbeam: $('#div').find(':header').first();
[07:41:11] <ankurk_> http://api.jquery.com/header-selector/
[07:41:45] <Qantourisc> Cork: sorry still newish to javascript, thoughed the {} was a javascript trick :p must be because of all the magic-js-libs i've been using. Thanks
[07:42:05] <Cork> Qantourisc: {} creates an object
[07:42:09] <Cork> [] is an array
[07:42:13] <ankurk_> Qantourisc: {} is usually an empty object
[07:42:16] <decx> strange that it's not called :headings as that's the proper name for h tags
[07:42:31] <ankurk_> decx: header is much better imo
[07:42:48] <sunbeam> ankurk_: thanks!
[07:42:53] <Cork> Qantourisc: so when you see { key:value } it is just an object with a list of key values sent as options to a function
[07:42:59] <ankurk_> sunbeam: did it work?
[07:43:31] <Cork> Qantourisc: it's commonly called hash in most languages
[07:43:33] <Qantourisc> Cork: just didn't knew javascript had no named-arguments, so I assumed {} would do it, cause some function take a {} :)
[07:43:36] <decx> there's not really a 'better' in that context is there ankurk_ ;) it's just strange that it'S called :header when h tags are conventionally called headings :D
[07:44:09] <Cork> Qantourisc: js has similar syntax to all c link languages
[07:44:12] <ankurk_> decx: hehehe yeah, actually I always thought it was called header tag
[07:44:17] <Cork> link==like
[07:44:41] <ankurk_> That feel good feeling when you help someone :
[07:44:47] <decx> hm, i actually don't know what the singular is called.
[07:44:56] <decx> header tag sounds right though
[07:46:43] <ankurk_> there's a separate tag called <header> as well
[07:47:04] <decx> yeah that's why i thought :header is prone to confusion
[07:54:49] <sunbeam> ankurk_: yes
[07:55:10] <sunbeam> i've got an element that contains a class starting with something-
[07:55:16] <sunbeam> the element is $(this)
[07:55:25] <sunbeam> how do I get just the word something- ?
[07:55:37] <Cork> this.className
[07:56:01] <tw2113> morning Cork
[07:56:10] <decx> or $(this).prop('className') if you're into overheads
[07:56:23] <Cork> sunbeam: if you want to use it you should prob add it as data- attribute instead
[07:56:40] <Cork> or $(this).attr('class')
[07:56:45] <Cork> :)
[07:57:11] <decx> ha
[07:57:18] <decx> for that extra bit of overhead
[07:57:24] <Cork> no
[07:57:30] <Cork> that isn't more overhead
[07:57:38] <sunbeam> I just need it from the class
[07:57:43] <Cork> $(this).attr('class')
[07:57:46] <sunbeam> with $(this).attr('class') I will get all the classes
[07:57:53] <Cork> maps to this.getAttribute('class')
[07:58:00] <Cork> sunbeam: yes
[07:58:13] <Cork> you will have handle the string
[07:58:33] <Cork> sunbeam: that is why i said you prob shouldn't use class for what you are planing to do
[07:58:41] <decx> and prop just goes to this.className ?
[07:59:14] <Cork> yes
[07:59:19] <sunbeam> how do you mean?
[07:59:26] <Cork> or rather this[name]
[07:59:38] <Cork> vs this.getAttribute(name)
[07:59:50] <Cork> sunbeam: <elm data-something="something">
[07:59:58] <Cork> and then $(this).data('something')
[08:00:14] <Cork> and you can do $('.' + $(this).data('something')) if you need that
[08:00:53] <sunbeam> Yep I know but the problem is that this is the CMS defining
[08:01:03] <Cork> ouch
[08:02:05] <Cork> sunbeam: do you want to find a class that starts with something-
[08:02:10] <Cork> and then use what is after the - ?
[08:03:15] <sunbeam> Cork: i just need the whole word
[08:03:17] <sunbeam> something-word
[08:03:27] <Cork> but you know something- is there?
[08:03:37] <Cork> i mean can you grep on 'something-' ?
[08:04:25] <silvio-> if i want to add an element to the dom, what is the fastest way? should i $('body').append("
[08:04:40] <silvio-> if i want to add an element to the dom, what is the fastest way? should i $('body').append("<div id='test'></div>");
[08:04:49] <Cork> js> ptin("foo bar something-word baz".match(/something-[^ ]+/)[0])
[08:04:54] <Cork> js> print("foo bar something-word baz".match(/something-[^ ]+/)[0])
[08:05:02] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[08:05:08] <b-ot> Cork: something-word
[08:05:16] <Cork> sunbeam: i mean something like that ^
[08:05:45] <ankurk_> silvio: it won't make much difference imo
[08:05:46] <Cork> silvio-: do you want to add one element or several?
[08:05:58] <Cork> silvio-: cause if you plan to add several it matters
[08:06:10] <Cork> and then you should move the append to happen in one swoop
[08:06:18] <Cork> cause dom modifications is very slow
[08:06:31] <Cork> (they trigger reflow and you want that as little as possible)
[08:06:34] <silvio-> i want to add 1 element, and add a click event to it, then i want to add several elements to another element on the page not the body
[08:06:53] <Cork> silvio-: the one element you can add how ever you like
[08:06:55] <Cork> won't matter
[08:07:01] <Cork> the other elements do though
[08:07:07] <sunbeam> Cork: thanks!!
[08:07:42] <silvio-> so if i want ot add alot of elements do i jsut combine them in a string var and append? or is there another way?
[08:07:46] <Cork> silvio-: var newHTML = []; for() { newHTML.push('<div></div>'); } $().append(newHTML.join(''))
[08:08:42] <silvio-> is that any faster than using a string?
[08:09:00] <decx> pushing markup into an array?
[08:09:03] <Cork> silvio-: concating a string is more expensive
[08:09:05] <decx> why not a document fragment
[08:09:25] <Cork> decx: no need for the overhead
[08:09:40] <Cork> decx: if you give the dom a long string it is the fastest way to get dom
[08:09:44] <silvio-> didnt know an array is after then a string
[08:09:50] <Cork> it is a lot faster to do it all in on swoop
[08:09:58] <decx> gonna try it out later
[08:10:02] <Cork> silvio-: strings isn't slower
[08:10:12] <Cork> silvio-: but they need to copy cause they are mutable
[08:10:27] <Cork> while an array is pointers in reference
[08:10:34] <Cork> so they don't need to update to add new content
[08:10:34] <silvio-> aww that makes sense
[08:11:34] <Cork> silvio-: and mainly cause old ie's leaked lit a sieve if you concated strings
[08:11:56] <Cork> silvio-: also another funny note if you need to optimize every last cycle you can
[08:12:12] <Cork> resetting with arr.length = 0; is a lot faster then arr = [];
[08:12:25] <Shackleford> what is the best practice to store .ajax data into a variable?  Does anyone have a good example?
[08:13:00] <decx> it is?
[08:13:01] <Cork> Shackleford: are you trying to return the value from ajax?
[08:13:07] <fabioportieri> var ajaxData = data; :P
[08:13:09] <Cork> decx: yes
[08:13:10] <decx> man gotta love irc :>
[08:13:19] <Shackleford> yes, I am trying to return the JSON
[08:13:29] <Cork> decx: cause arr.length = 0; will only gc the data points
[08:13:45] <bengalo> are there any drawbacks to using a lot of $(..).load(url element > *) since its not a very optimized selector? should i rather parse the received $(..).load(url element) to only give me the inner html?
[08:13:45] <Shackleford> does var ajaxData = data; go out side of the scope of the ajax method?
[08:13:49] <Cork> decx: while arr = []; will scrap the entire array, and everything AND create a new array object
[08:14:01] <decx> it does make sense
[08:14:06] <Cork> decx: os if you do it a lot you create a much larger amount of garbage
[08:14:13] <decx> and the initial length of the array doesnt matter?
[08:14:14] <Cork> so*
[08:14:27] <Cork> what do you mean?
[08:14:40] <decx> i don't know what i mean ^^
[08:15:07] <Cork> js> var a = ['a', 'b', 'c']; a.length = 0; print(JSON.stringify(a))
[08:15:09] <silvio-> cork what if the elements im adding in the array are jquery objects of those elements
[08:15:15] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[08:15:19] <Cork> sigh
[08:15:31] <silvio-> would i push the first element of the object into the array?
[08:15:31] <Cork> right the bot don't have JSON.stringify anymore
[08:15:33] <Cork> forgot that
[08:15:54] <Cork> silvio-: you shouldn't do that
[08:16:03] <Cork> silvio-: you can build an array of dom elements
[08:16:08] <Cork> but that will be slower
[08:16:18] <silvio-> actually let me re explain, i am using jquery to move an element, the elemtn exist in the page, but i want ot move it to another place in the dom
[08:16:23] <Cork> jqobj[0] == dom element
[08:16:28] <Shackleford> fabioportieri when assigning that variable, where exactly do you assign inside the method call or outside?
[08:16:54] <Cork> silvio-: then just build a jquery selection of the elements and append them in one go
[08:16:59] <decx> you can use pointer by reference, so if you do var stuff = $('.mydiv') and then append(stuff) it will move your .mydiv there
[08:17:07] <Cork> what i talked about before was creating new elements
[08:17:09] <Cork> not moving
[08:17:19] <silvio-> oh so i dont have to remove it before moving it?
[08:17:31] <Cork> decx: ya, but again you want to do that in one go
[08:17:36] <Cork> not append over and over again
[08:17:39] <decx> yes
[08:17:42] <Cork> cause that will kill performance
[08:17:50] <Cork> silvio-: no
[08:17:57] <Cork> silvio-: dom elements can only have one parent
[08:18:10] <Cork> so when you append it at a new place the parent refernce changes
[08:18:14] <Cork> *reference
[08:18:57] <fabioportieri> Shackleford: outside the method scope you won't get a valid reference to data
[08:19:22] <fabioportieri> Shackleford: maybe promises are what you need?
[08:19:30] <Shackleford> fabioportieri, ok
[08:19:34] <Shackleford> makes sense
[08:24:51] <webguy02_> is there a way to get error response codes (other than 404) when using CORS? seems like none of the original headers are available on an error response.
[08:26:09] <SprkDev> I want only the modal-body to be filled with remote content. not the entire thing. how do I do that with bootstrap?
[08:26:41] <silvio-> what is the proper way to add an onclick event to an element thats newly created?
[08:26:52] <ankurk_> silvio: Event Delegation
[08:27:03] <decx> you either delegate our you add it directly
[08:27:53] <bengalo> are there any drawbacks to using a lot of $(..).load(url element > *) since its not a very optimized selector? should i rather parse the received $(..).load(url element) to only give me the inner html or is there another smart way to do this?
[08:28:32] <decx> if you want to use something more complex than a simple #id fragment you should use ajax directly
[08:29:16] <bengalo> well, its nothing more complex than getting the "inner" html (that is without the element itself)
[08:29:32] <decx> > * will always be terrible
[08:29:36] <bengalo> so more code on $.get vs bad selector on load
[08:29:54] <axilaris> hi, is it possible to get the row directly by specifying the id ? if i had something like <tr id="b">
[08:30:06] <bengalo> $('#b')
[08:30:15] <axilaris> would this work ? $('#tableId tr id A').remove();
[08:30:39] <BillCriswell> axilaris: No.
[08:30:40] <axilaris> bengalo: can i specify in sequence of table id , tbody then tr ?
[08:30:42] <bengalo> it its an id, why all the trouble?
[08:30:53] <axilaris> well.. there are duplicates
[08:30:55] <BillCriswell> axilaris: Overkill. ids are unique. Just use the id.
[08:31:00] <bengalo> in ids?
[08:31:06] <axilaris> yup
[08:31:11] <bengalo> well, not good then
[08:31:11] <axilaris> but i can make it unique
[08:31:18] <bengalo> you should
[08:31:19] <axilaris> just wondering if its needed
[08:31:21] <bengalo> thats what ids are for
[08:31:23] <decx> identification :>
[08:31:36] <bengalo> the other things you use are classes
[08:31:39] <BillCriswell> I want chinese food... but I always regret it immediately after I eat it.
[08:31:44] <bengalo> many things of the same sort
[08:31:52] <bengalo> haha
[08:31:54] <axilaris> ids cant be grouped ?
[08:32:05] <bengalo> well, what do you mean by grouped?
[08:32:11] <axilaris> in tables
[08:32:18] <decx> i can't get real chines food here. it's all that westernized crap with tons of glutamate
[08:32:34] <bengalo> you can have <td id="a"><td id="b">
[08:32:37] <bengalo> but never
[08:32:39] <bengalo> you can have <td id="a"><td id="a">
[08:32:43] <BillCriswell> decx: I don't even know if I know the difference between read and fake chinese food.
[08:32:44] <axilaris> i cant do a loop of rows  $('#tableId tr').each(function()
[08:32:55] <axilaris> and get ids for each
[08:32:59] <decx> you do once you had real chinese
[08:33:00] <BillCriswell> axilaris: What is your goal?
[08:33:08] <bengalo> BillCriswell good point ;)
[08:33:16] <BillCriswell> decx: What if I just really like the imitation?
[08:33:22] <axilaris> my goal is to get the row... based on tableid and row id
[08:33:31] <decx> nothing wrong with that, i'm not judging
[08:33:38] <bengalo> use a data tag then
[08:33:42] <bengalo> for the row id
[08:33:45] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha I know, but I want to try authentic.
[08:33:48] <axilaris> but if its not possible then row ids have to be unique then
[08:34:09] <bengalo> you can give the rows a class
[08:34:12] <bengalo> and then go for
[08:34:15] <decx> for example i love the fake indian stuff, but the real thing isnt for me ^^
[08:34:35] <BillCriswell> decx: Another thing that I have no idea what's real or not haha.
[08:34:43] <BillCriswell> Since I've only ever eaten it in America.
[08:34:43] <bengalo> $('.yourclassfortherow').filter(function() { return $(this).data('id') == yourid; });
[08:35:06] <axilaris> ok thanks
[08:35:32] <bengalo> alternatively use filter('selectorhere') but i dont like the [data-...] for the selector
[08:36:00] <axilaris> i can have multiple classes right ?
[08:36:09] <bengalo> multiple elements can have the same class
[08:36:10] <axilaris> just wondering if i occupy the class name
[08:36:12] <bengalo> if thats what u mean
[08:36:24] <axilaris> then others have to be removed
[08:36:26] <BillCriswell> axilaris: class="foo bar" can be selected with .foo, .bar or .foo.bar
[08:36:31] <axilaris> ok
[08:36:47] <decx> occupy class name, now that's class warfare
[08:37:41] <bengalo> :>
[08:37:58] <axilaris> not occupy :) if its restricted to one
[08:38:06] <axilaris> but it appears multiple is possible
[08:38:12] <BillCriswell> As many as you want.
[08:38:20] <BillCriswell> .bar.foo would also work for selecting it.
[08:38:29] <BillCriswell> Forgot to mention that.
[08:39:27] <decx> but don't overdo that chain selecting classnames isn't great
[08:39:57] <BillCriswell> Indeed... if I ever need to select something by more than one class I get suspicious as to what I'm doing weird.
[08:40:10] <bengalo> haha yeah
[08:40:58] <bengalo> but i started using something like $('tbody', 'parent') a lot lately
[08:41:10] <decx> we all love context here :>
[08:41:50] <BillCriswell> I still like to do $('parent').find('tbody')
[08:42:21] <BillCriswell> More typing but easier to follow in my head.
[08:42:38] <saml> hello is there public integration page for  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/test   ?
[08:42:45] <saml> i want to see how tests are run
[08:43:17] <BillCriswell> saml: https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[08:43:23] <Shackleford> I am trying to get my JSON payload to append to the screen after a successful ajax request
[08:43:27] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/jquery/jquery#running-the-unit-tests
[08:43:33] <Shackleford> http://jsfiddle.net/AKD6V/ here is my code
[08:43:35] <saml> yah but is there github page or something that i can just visit and run the test?
[08:43:54] <saml> wanted to give the test page link to people
[08:44:02] <BillCriswell> Shackleford: You just want append.
[08:44:05] <Shackleford> not sure why it logs to console but not my screen, I have a div of id="payload" in the html
[08:44:08] <Shackleford> yea
[08:44:15] <BillCriswell> You would need to reverse the two if you want to use appendTo
[08:44:32] <Shackleford> the two method?
[08:44:36] <decx> parent.append(stuff) and stuff.appendTo(parent)
[08:44:47] <BillCriswell> $('<p>Foo</p>').appendTo('#foo') === $('#foo').append('<p>Foo</p>')
[08:45:22] <saml> http://swarm.jquery.org/index.php?action=result&item=1711788&raw=
[08:45:26] <Shackleford> ahhh got ya
[08:45:59] <Shackleford> ok so my JSON is a nested array, how do I get the entire object to append, it is only appending [object Object]
[08:46:27] <BillCriswell> Shackleford: You want to put json inside the element?
[08:46:40] <Shackleford> just for testing perpuses
[08:46:42] <decx> console.log your object and check what you want to pull out and display
[08:46:43] <Shackleford> but yea
[08:46:50] <decx> it's quite literal
[08:49:14] <BillCriswell> Shackleford: If you need it in string format you could do something.toString() but the console is much, much more useful.
[08:52:51] <duch_kazatel> "Flying a plane is no different than riding a bicycle, just a lot harder to put baseball cards in the spokes." - Rex Kramer
[08:52:53] <Shackleford> what is the correct term to "pull data out of an array" ?
[08:52:55] <duch_kazatel> that's today's quote folks.
[08:53:12] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford define "pull"
[08:53:18] <duch_kazatel> you mean retrieve data from an array index?
[08:53:21] <duch_kazatel> or remove it?
[08:53:27] <Shackleford> retrieve
[08:53:47] <BillCriswell> something[0], something[1]
[08:54:22] <duch_kazatel> accessing array elements
[08:54:28] <Shackleford> thanks
[08:54:32] <garbagegod> So when I do $myContainer.find('video'), the result is the inner html of the video element (just the source elements)
[08:54:45] <garbagegod> how do I get a jquery reference to the actual video reference?
[08:54:53] <garbagegod> actual video element*
[08:55:01] <decx> it should give you the whole element
[08:55:04] <duch_kazatel> video will find the video element.
[08:55:20] <garbagegod> That's what I thought
[08:55:36] <garbagegod> when I log the .html() of the return though, I only see the interior of the video element
[08:55:42] <garbagegod> is that just .html()
[08:55:46] <decx> well html is the problem
[08:55:46] <garbagegod> 's behavior?
[08:56:15] <duch_kazatel> garbagegod yeah, .html() does that.
[08:56:32] <duch_kazatel> log out everything up to that part.
[08:56:39] <garbagegod> okay, how can I output the whole DOM of the element as a string though to be sure I have the actual video element
[08:56:52] <decx> lose the html
[08:57:03] <decx> observe http://jsfiddle.net/decx/BAdhP/
[08:57:11] <duch_kazatel> decx is a magician.
[08:57:22] <decx> i do a lot of handstuff
[08:58:07] <garbagegod> I think I got it, sorry for the dumb questions
[08:58:09] <garbagegod> thanks guys
[08:58:13] <duch_kazatel> nah it's really nbd.
[08:58:19] <decx> there are no dumb questions
[08:58:25] <decx> until you ask them
[08:58:26] <duch_kazatel> just don't repeatedly ask the same questions over and over and over.
[08:59:44] <duch_kazatel> anybody want to try to dump through this godawful constructor function for me so i don't have to do work?
[09:03:12] <decx> yeah, right
[09:03:13] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel $15 per minute?
[09:03:16] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[09:03:37] <duch_kazatel> got shoot me.  it breaks in jquery 1.11.  throws an awesome "document is undefined" error.
[09:03:38] <BinaryKitten> first 1/2 hour up front
[09:03:53] <decx> i'd rather debug jop008s jquery mobile markup
[09:04:09] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel are you using an iife
[09:05:06] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten it's more that it contains some pretty magical stuff like this: this.errorMessage = $(this.field.tagName === 'UL' ? '<li/>' : '<em/>', {'class': 'error','text': message});
[09:05:59] <decx> hey i remember reading that last night before shutting down for the night and having nightmares
[09:06:03] <decx> what does it even do
[09:06:40] <BinaryKitten> creates either a li or em with class error, containing the message as text..
[09:06:53] <duch_kazatel> the first part parses out and creates either an LI or an EM based on a value fed via the constructor, and assigns a css class along with some text to the object
[09:07:05] <decx> never knew you can use a ternary like that
[09:07:21] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:07:21] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel humour me and wrap the ternary in ( )
[09:07:42] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten is that works i'm going to stab myself.
[09:07:46] <BinaryKitten> and do this.field.tagName.toUpperCase()
[09:07:52] <BinaryKitten> just in case
[09:08:02] <yaymukund> When I call `$foo.on(…)`, can I get an id or something that I can use to unbind the event handler when destroying my view?
[09:08:08] <Shackleford> So i have a question about the .ajax method, is it proper to put all my app.js code in the success block?
[09:08:22] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford abstract out functions and call those instead.
[09:08:24] <BinaryKitten> yaymukund $foo.off('event')
[09:08:42] <yaymukund> so then I just have to keep the selector around and store the event name somewhere
[09:09:06] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten no go - there's a deeper problem with this because the calling function is broken - "TypeError: this.field.tagName is undefined"
[09:09:16] <BinaryKitten> yaymukund if you do $foo.on('click.yaymukund', function() {});  you can do $foo.off('click.yaymukund'); which wll remove only that click
[09:09:29] <Shackleford> so it is ok to have functions getting called in the success block, that is the best practice?
[09:09:38] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel which should help illumincate the route of hte issue
[09:09:44] <yaymukund> BinaryKitten: that's slick. Thank you, never knew that.
[09:09:53] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten aye - the calling function is way wonky.
[09:10:00] <BinaryKitten> yaymukund np
[09:10:29] <duch_kazatel> i'd rather just rewrite this portion of the code to bring it up to standards at this point.  which is something we're doing department-wide anyway.
[09:10:52] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel go forth and succeed :)
[09:10:58] <duch_kazatel> yep.  i always do :)
[09:11:19] <duch_kazatel> this is cake - I did a ground-up rewrite of all of our search frontend javascript once.
[09:12:19] <yaymukund> I often prefer just plain old `make` these days
[09:12:43] <yaymukund> man, I'm turning into my dad with these bad jokes
[09:14:05] <duch_kazatel> http://louhuang.com/2048-numberwang/ aaaahahahahahaha
[09:14:24] <decx> you're late :>
[09:14:35] <duch_kazatel> apparently.  this is genius
[09:15:09] <decx> was a bit disappointed in the lack of wengernum and no css3d to rotate the board
[09:15:55] <BinaryKitten> pfft
[09:16:01] <BinaryKitten> numberwang so last century
[09:16:07] <BinaryKitten> wordwang, now theres a decent game
[09:19:48] <decx> great, another productive workday ruined by watching mitchell and webb playlists
[09:23:19] <EnlightenMental> can anyone recommend a swipe lib that doesnt poorly effect text selection or vertical scrolling?  it seems left / right swipes mess with vertical scrolling... using jQuery touchSwipe
[09:23:47] <duch_kazatel> maybe hammer.js?
[09:24:16] <EnlightenMental> hammer looks heavier than what i may need
[09:24:27] <duch_kazatel> are you checking to make sure the browser supports touch events before binding anything btw?  or does touchSwipe do that for you?
[09:24:28] <EnlightenMental> I dont need pinch, etc... just basic swipe atm
[09:24:33] <VectorX> i got a click event on some buttons, one of them has a class item called  pd,   inside the click how can i say   if this has class pd { } ?
[09:24:48] <decx> this.className
[09:24:51] <EnlightenMental> duch_kazatel: right now, I'm allowing swipe on all devices
[09:25:00] <decx> uh $(this).hasClass()
[09:25:03] <VectorX> decx its got a bunch of classes pd is one of them
[09:25:03] <duch_kazatel> if ($(this).hasClass('pd')) {}
[09:25:10] <VectorX> ok
[09:33:13] <SprkDev> how can I write jquery that shows me in console what ever I clicked. Like the div name?
[09:36:23] <BinaryKitten> $(document).on('click', '*', function() { console.log('You clicked on a ' + this.tagName + ' with id ' + this.id); });
[09:36:34] <BinaryKitten> ah they left
[09:36:34] <jphase> (was going to respond but he rage quit :\)
[09:36:35] <BinaryKitten> bugger
[09:36:39] <jphase> h8 that
[09:36:56] <decx> why click * and not just log event target
[09:37:59] <duch_kazatel> wait what;s going on?
[09:38:09] <duch_kazatel> oh nvm.
[09:48:37] <Tomasso> how do i select all nodes that contain text inside?
[09:49:04] <Qiller> hi friends, can i add "comma" here? 59 to 5,9 using jQuery.
[09:49:38] <duch_kazatel> Qiller why are you adding a comma?
[09:49:40] <decx> n/10
[09:49:46] <duch_kazatel> and you'd do that with javascript.
[09:50:15] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: why i need add coma or "point". var test = 59; i want transform 59 to 5.9
[09:50:35] <ankurk_> do a parseFloat(test)?
[09:50:44] <duch_kazatel> Qiller let's rephrase - will it always be two digits?  a use case would be helpful.
[09:50:55] <snover> let’s see. does this still work…
[09:50:56] <snover> 1101
[09:50:57] <snover> `101
[09:51:14] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: can i insert comma here? 59 to 5.9 35 to 3.5
[09:51:18] <snover> no. alright. Qiller, http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[09:51:45] <Velveeta> qiller: that's not something you need jquery to do, you can easily do that with just native javascript
[09:52:00] <Qiller> snover: haha omg i need insert comma 59 to 5.9
[09:52:08] <jphase> Tomasso: including whitespace?
[09:52:12] <snover> haha omg you need to learn programming to d othat
[09:52:13] <Qiller> Velveeta: command to include ?
[09:52:24] <decx> /10 ffs
[09:52:25] <Velveeta> go google 'regular expressions in javascript'
[09:52:30] <Velveeta> or like decx said
[09:52:33] <Qiller> snover: need learn programming book to insert COMMA at middle string
[09:52:40] <snover> yes
[09:52:40] <Tomasso> jphase, without whitespace
[09:52:43] <Velveeta> depending on if it's always gonna be 1 decimal place or what
[09:52:45] <Qiller> nice support snover
[09:52:56] <Velveeta> qiller: that *is* nice support, actually
[09:53:15] <jphase> Tomasso: something like...  $('body *').contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType == 3 && this.nodeValue.match(/\S/); });
[09:53:23] <Velveeta> this is a jquery channel, we're here to help with jquery... what you're asking is a basic programming concept... if you don't know how to do basic programming, you're not gonna get very far with jquery
[09:53:39] <duch_kazatel> Qiller you asked an exceedingly simply question - the answer depends greatly on why you need to do that.
[09:53:42] <duch_kazatel> what's the use case?
[09:53:43] <Qiller> I loved this channel when I was helping people like ajpiano the user.
[09:53:45] <jphase> Tomasso: (you'd chain whatever you want onto that like .wrap or whatever, or you could make that into a function you call
[09:53:47] <jphase> )
[09:54:00] <Qiller> my simple question have a book to learn
[09:54:01] <duch_kazatel> Qiller you want people to write code for you - not help.
[09:54:01] <Qiller> great.
[09:54:07] <duch_kazatel> Qiller i offered help.
[09:54:07] <Velveeta> there it is... "you guys used to be cool.. why can't you just teach me how to divide by 10?"
[09:54:08] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:54:09] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:54:13] <Qiller> no duch_kazatel i want the command to learn about it
[09:54:27] <Velveeta> i gave you something to google
[09:54:34] <Qiller> and u send me a book to learn a simple command
[09:54:52] <Velveeta> first of all, they're functions, or methods, not commands... so yes, i would agree you need a book
[09:54:57] <snover> i can send you to codeacademy instead if you want
[09:55:00] <Qiller> If you send me go to google, because there is a channel?
[09:55:17] <Qiller> dont write a code, say the command only
[09:55:32] <Velveeta> so, if you "want the command to learn about it" and we told you the 'command', how would you learn about it?
[09:55:33] <snover> mathematics.
[09:55:38] <Velveeta> use bing instead of google?
[09:55:40] <vladikoff> "Ok google, insert comma"
[09:55:55] <Qiller> great support haha
[09:55:58] <Velveeta> i gave you something to google to learn about... regular expressions
[09:56:03] <jphase> learning basic string manipulation is a bit outside the scope of this channel Qiller. This is a channel to help with programming, not a community college course
[09:56:05] <Velveeta> instead you said "no, tell me how to do it"
[09:56:16] <Velveeta> jphase: +1
[09:56:18] <Qiller> what is your name? Got o google friend and learn about Jesus.
[09:56:29] <Velveeta> i'm an atheist
[09:56:34] <Velveeta> why would i want to go learn about jesus
[09:56:35] <snover> hahahahahahahahahahahahaha what in the world
[09:56:43] <jphase> ?
[09:56:56] <Jattenalle> you dont even need programming to do that, just rudimentary understanding of basic level math
[09:57:11] <Qiller> jphase: can i insert comma here? 59 to 5.9? YES, LEARN ABOUT number_format
[09:57:16] <Qiller> easy, not?
[09:57:27] <Velveeta> i said "learn about regular expressions"
[09:57:31] <Velveeta> easy, not?
[09:57:33] <jphase> Qiller: 59 / 10 = 5.9
[09:57:38] <jphase> math
[09:57:46] <jphase> arithmatic
[09:57:50] <Qiller> jphase: omg, rly?
[09:57:50] <jphase> metic?
[09:57:52] <Jattenalle> yeah really, this is a bit silly...
[09:58:00] <Qiller> haha
[09:58:22] <Tomasso> my main problem is, im doing a form filling tool for myself by the time, to help me apply for jobs. I want to select the label related to a form input field, but the problem is that the <label for...> tag is not always used. So I traversed the dom, but found many problems on that, so I downloaded a plugin that selects the nearest element to another this is my entries selection code http://pastebin.com/WFXs6fZL
[09:59:03] <jphase> Tomasso: you don't need a plugin, just use .closest unless they're siblings
[09:59:09] <jphase> in which case use .siblings?
[09:59:26] <Velveeta> tomasso: that reminds me a lot of this... https://xkcd.com/1319/ :D
[09:59:29] <BillCriswell> Tomasso: Browsers have auto fill... I might be missing something though.
[10:00:04] <Qiller>  <jphase> in which case use .siblings?
[10:00:22] <Tomasso> closest is for the dom.. the problem is that sometimes the text related to a form entry is not the previous sibling.. it can be "anything"
[10:00:25] <Qiller> in wich case use number / 10 or learn about number_format
[10:00:27] <Qiller> easy to me
[10:00:53] <BillCriswell> This channel went to poop.
[10:00:55] <jphase> Qiller: number_format is a php function
[10:00:58] <jphase> and at this point I have NO clue what your'e even talking about
[10:01:31] <Qiller> yourFloatVarHere.toFixed(2); LIKE number_format
[10:01:33] <Velveeta> tomasso: have you given any thought to how css is going to play into things? with positioning, anything could be the closest element, regardless of where it sits in the dom
[10:01:49] <Jattenalle> Qiller, you want code that makes var = 59; into var = 5.9; ?
[10:01:53] <Velveeta> qiller: that won't do what you're wanting to do
[10:02:00] <Velveeta> that would make 59 into 59.00
[10:02:30] <Qiller> Jattenalle: yes.
[10:02:33] <Velveeta> also, i'm still confused over whether you want a period or a comma.. you keep saying comma, but using periods and commas interchangeably
[10:02:36] <jphase> Qiller: perhaps if you provided more information than "I want to turn 59 into 5.9" you would allow us to help you instead of tell you about division
[10:02:37] <Tomasso> BillCriswell: I tried many tools to aid me in the job application form completion, AutoFill, Roboforms.. etc.. but none of them works for filling more than the first name last name and email.. I would like something that stores previous input and in future forms fill entries who have the most similar related text with the stored value
[10:02:45] <Qiller> 59 to 5.9 without / 10 math
[10:02:49] <Guest11417> Could I ask: Is there an event to bind to in jquery mobile 1.4 that fires when a page is loaded with a url fragment hash but that hash doesn't exist in the page ie no data-role="page" id="the_url_fragement" ? Thank you.
[10:02:57] <jphase> Qiller: substring?
[10:03:04] <Qiller> great! substring!
[10:03:15] <BillCriswell> Tomasso: "most similar related text" ?
[10:03:19] <Qiller> why learn a big book if u can say "SUBSTRING" ?
[10:03:23] <Jattenalle> Qiller, what's wrong with just using the obvious straight forward way of doing it? are you cheating on a test?
[10:03:42] <jphase> Qiller: don't be a vague little brat and tell us what you mean and we'll be able to help you... your information was quite insufficient
[10:03:49] <Velveeta> why bother learning anything at all when you can just ask others to do the learning for you?
[10:04:02] <snover> help vampire.
[10:04:09] <jphase> *sigh* and to think, some people know what RTFM stands for...
[10:04:09] <Tomasso> BillCriswell: computational distance (the minimum amount of operations for a string to become another), such as the levenshtein algorithm
[10:04:35] <Jattenalle> Qiller, myVar = (parseFloat(myThing) / 10.0); myVar.toFixed(1); enjoy. pay attention in class. go away
[10:05:11] <Tomasso> I dont pretend the form filling tool fills everything ok without human intervention, but it should remember all what i fil and apply it o new formsl
[10:05:20] <snover> the more you keep answering, the more this will continue to happen
[10:05:26] <Qiller> ty Jattenalle. "Qiller, learn about parseFloat maybe its work fine to you"
[10:05:38] <Velveeta> somebody said parseFloat like 10 minutes ago
[10:05:45] <Jattenalle> that's not what i said.. and that wont work... but ok
[10:05:47] * Jattenalle rolls eyes
[10:05:50] <Velveeta> learn how to read and you can stop making snarky comments about things people are telling you to learn about
[10:06:05] <Jattenalle> not even telling him to learn, literally telling him exactly what to do
[10:06:11] <Velveeta> right
[10:06:13] <decx> just had a few good laughs in the shower just thinking about it, i think that's going to be my go-to meta snark for weeks to come 'what's the jquery command to make 5.9 from 59'
[10:06:14] <Tomasso> Velveeta: the nearest plugin allows you to select the nearest element filtered by a selector, so you can get the nearest text, or the nearest image and so on
[10:06:37] <Jattenalle> decx, hah :P
[10:06:38] <Velveeta> tomasso: and that factors in positioning as well?
[10:06:52] <jphase> Qiller: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+string+manipulation
[10:07:05] <Jattenalle> come to think of it
[10:07:06] <Qiller> Velveeta: learn a big book. its not cool. if you want help me... great! if you send me a big book to learn about a simple "parseFloat"... sorry but its pooooor help
[10:07:11] <Jattenalle> the only, real, way to turn 59 into 5.9
[10:07:17] * Velveeta facepalms.
[10:07:20] <jphase> omfg
[10:07:21] <snover> Qiller: you are a help vampire. stop.
[10:07:27] <Velveeta> you're still on the whole "learn a big book" thing, you're useless
[10:07:27] <Jattenalle> is to send an ajax to google, with the question included..
[10:07:29] <BillCriswell> POOOOOOOOOR HELP VELVEETA
[10:07:30] <Jattenalle> then parse the result
[10:07:34] <Qiller> jphase: discovered google today?
[10:07:35] <Velveeta> do you not know how to use a search engine?
[10:07:38] <snover> http://www.skidmore.edu/~pdwyer/e/eoc/help_vampire.htm
[10:07:49] <jphase> Qiller: apparently you haven't, no
[10:07:52] <Velveeta> we've collectively thrown out probably half a dozen things you could have googled on, and helped yourself in < 5 minutes
[10:07:54] <Qiller> haha its fun.
[10:08:10] <Velveeta> instead, you sit here and waste half an hour of channel time trying to figure out how to fucking divide a number by 10
[10:08:25] <Velveeta> and then blame us for not being helpful because you lack reading comprehension
[10:08:26] <jphase> haven't had to do this in awhile.... /ignore
[10:08:42] <Jattenalle> https://www.google.se/search?num=50&q=what+is+59+divided+by+10&oq=what+is+59+divided+by+10&gs_l=serp.3...2179.5206.0.5422.15.8.0.7.7.0.91.510.8.8.0....0...1c.1.37.serp..1.14.445.snfft2mMb-4
[10:08:55] <Jattenalle> just use jquery to ajax into that, then parse the result Qiller
[10:09:09] <Qiller> thank Jattenalle
[10:09:09] <snover> Jattenalle: now you’re using your ass.
[10:09:20] <snover> hm, that joke doesn’t work in text
[10:09:20] <snover> oh well
[10:09:25] <Jattenalle> snover, if it's stupid, and it works.. it's not stupid! :D
[10:09:26] <Qiller> omg
[10:09:29] <Tomasso> Velveeta: i could be able to make the selected element to be the nearest at the left and more or less in the middle of the input field
[10:09:30] <Qiller> ass? wtf?
[10:09:31] <Velveeta> you can do it put yo' ass into it?
[10:10:19] <Qiller> friends, jquery have any effect like css zoom ? or i need read a big book to learn about it?
[10:10:32] <Velveeta> tomasso: what i mean is, say a page has something like this going on: <input name="something_obscure" /> <span>Name:</span> and in their css, they have: input + span { float: left; }
[10:10:37] <Velveeta> does it account for that?
[10:10:40] <jphase> I never understood folks that piss off the people that want to help them. It's like people that are rude to people that handle their food... not a good idea
[10:10:46] <Velveeta> qiller: you need to read a big book
[10:10:56] <Jattenalle> jphase, indeed
[10:10:58] <Velveeta> GO LEARN, we're not here to do your javascript 101 code
[10:10:58] <NoiseEee> Qiller: i'd say probably 3 big books, 2 small books and a paragraph or two
[10:11:07] <Qiller> great haha
[10:11:23] <jphase> I think there's a series on jQuery zoom plugins... part of the Britannica collection
[10:11:35] <Tomasso> Velveeta: the nearest plugin would return the nearest in term of pixels, it should work. But using the DOM should be impossible
[10:11:38] <BillCriswell> 2nd edition
[10:11:42] <Velveeta> tomasso: neato
[10:12:35] <BillCriswell> Tomasso: How many jobs are you applying for that makes this worth it?
[10:12:37] <Velveeta> "is there jquery plugin for making program build itself from configuration file generated from powerpoint presentation?"
[10:13:08] <Velveeta> even something like that would be worth our time to investigate, as it's an interesting question with a level of complexity
[10:13:18] <Velveeta> instead, you ask questions like "is there jquery question to add 2 numbers?"
[10:13:32] <Velveeta> and when we say "use the math + operator" you say "you people aren't helpful"
[10:13:37] <decx> fear not peasants for i have come to the rescue http://jsfiddle.net/decx/kVk2Q/
[10:13:40] <Velveeta> learn or gtfo
[10:13:55] <BillCriswell> You're feeding the trolls.
[10:14:13] <Tomasso> Im most of the time doing so.. the companies say i have a good profile.. did my page with a portfolio on android, ruby, etc with sample source code, and they just say call you later
[10:14:14] <Velveeta> i know it.. and i hate myself for doing it
[10:14:19] <drej> what is happening
[10:14:30] <drej> is it Trolling Friday or something
[10:14:31] <Velveeta> drej: just typical idiocy
[10:14:33] <drej> did i not get the memo?
[10:14:35] <bengalo> almost missed the whole 59 to 5.9 thing, glad i scrolled up!
[10:14:37] <Velveeta> heheheh
[10:14:50] <Velveeta> and i *still* don't know if he wanted 5.9 or 5,9
[10:14:53] <bengalo> what a nice person
[10:14:56] <bengalo> haah yeah
[10:15:03] <Velveeta> since he used both examples, and repeatedly said comma, but accepted period as an answer
[10:15:43] <bengalo> well, he refused to / 10 for some reason, so..
[10:15:43] <Tomasso> I tried doing my own company but the two guys that were helping me in argentina quit. im italian, by the time visiting my son in colombia until i get a job in the uk (h1b visa for usa reached its limit)
[10:15:48] <Velveeta> yep
[10:16:08] <BillCriswell> bengalo: but that's not jquery.
[10:16:08] <Velveeta> tomasso: dude, you're all over the world.. like carmen sandiego
[10:16:14] <bengalo> aaahh right
[10:16:24] <BillCriswell> I *need* to use jQuery for solution.
[10:16:33] <Velveeta> bill: $([5.9]).each(function () { this / 10; }); :D
[10:16:40] <BillCriswell> I didn't include the Javascript plugin.
[10:16:50] <Velveeta> damnit, 59, not 5.9
[10:16:50] <bengalo> well, im sorry, wrong chan
[10:16:52] * bengalo parts
[10:17:14] * bengalo joins they told me to use jquery
[10:19:02] <BillCriswell> No book please, just solution.
[10:19:14] <bengalo> "book" :)
[10:19:21] <bengalo> like we gave him an amazon link
[10:19:34] <bengalo> oh no, i have to read all this?
[10:20:26] <Tomasso> Velveeta: my sperm has spread into colombia, but there is no job here and I want to go abroad
[10:20:40] <BillCriswell> Tomasso: Did you just say that casually?
[10:21:01] <Velveeta> tomasso: make the druglords have need of a web presence? :)
[10:21:06] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/PIfhvFW.jpg
[10:21:07] <BillCriswell> I think that may be the coolest thing I've ever heard.
[10:21:47] <Tomasso> Velveeta: haha may be encryption in the comunication.. but i hadn had the chance to meet one yeet
[10:22:06] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/WmMPzlw.png
[10:22:24] <Velveeta> you should watch Archer, he teaches you all about that stuff.. you just have to look for la madrina
[10:22:43] <Velveeta> decx: nice
[10:22:44] <bengalo> haha Velveeta :>
[10:23:52] <Tomasso> Velveeta: hoho I know her story.. la madrina i heard that was killed last year
[10:26:37] <duch_kazatel> weeee
[10:26:54] <duch_kazatel> i hate css sometimes.
[10:27:40] <BillCriswell> I hate web development in general most of the time.
[10:27:52] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif
[10:27:58] <decx> not as much as physical labour though
[10:28:03] <Velveeta> definitely
[10:28:15] <Velveeta> i hate css sometimes, but i hate breaking a sweat even more ;)
[10:28:45] <bberry> if im doing 3-4 css changes in js using like element.css('xxxx','yyyy'), is there a way to give the .css function multiple changes?
[10:28:59] <Velveeta> bberry: you can pass it an object map
[10:29:01] <BillCriswell> bberry: An object.
[10:29:20] <BillCriswell> element.css({color: 'blue', backgroundColor: 'purple'});
[10:29:21] <Velveeta> which is the preferred method of changing multiple at once (outside of simply changing classes), because it does it in one operation
[10:29:21] <bberry> ah nice. so .css({height: xxx, width: yyy, color: zzz });?
[10:29:24] <bberry> nice
[10:29:29] <bberry> thanks
[10:29:40] <decx> note that getting it is a bit strange
[10:29:44] <decx> as you pass an array instead
[10:30:02] <decx> .css(['width','height'...])
[10:30:16] <bberry> ?
[10:30:29] <bberry> oh
[10:30:29] <decx> that's for receiving multiple
[10:30:32] <bberry> i see
[10:30:34] <BillCriswell> He's just trying to set not get.
[10:30:34] <bberry> yeah that is odd
[10:30:48] <decx> yeah just telling it because it's odd
[10:30:50] <decx> ^^
[10:30:56] <bberry> i wonder why they dont just fill in the object you give with values
[10:31:04] <bberry> (if you were requesting css)
[10:32:56] <bberry> so im passing in an object, should i just create the object, save it to a var, and then pass it in, or just throw an object literal in the .css call?
[10:33:25] <Velveeta> i just throw the literal at it
[10:34:14] <snover> do whatever makes the code the clearest to whomever is reading it
[10:34:18] <BillCriswell> bberry: If you're changing a lot of properties I'd just create a new class
[10:34:26] <Velveeta> right
[10:34:28] <BillCriswell> CSS class*
[10:34:35] <Velveeta> and then just add/removeClass
[10:34:38] <bberry> kk. its 4 properties
[10:35:02] <bberry> im doing some changes to some of the jquery ui classes
[10:35:25] <Velveeta> do they need to be programmatic changes during runtime?
[10:35:31] <bberry> well, to a jquery ui element rather
[10:35:31] <Velveeta> or can you just add those into your css files?
[10:35:39] <bberry> i can just put em in my css probably
[10:35:47] <Velveeta> that would be the ideal way to do it
[10:35:49] <bberry> kk
[10:36:01] <bberry> so i guess just do a .addClass() on it?
[10:36:11] <decx> most ui functions have a way to add a custom class, i prefer that to overwriting ui styles
[10:36:20] <Velveeta> well, if you're trying to modify properties in e.g. .ui-dialog-title or something
[10:36:43] <bberry> yeah, some of the properties are already defined in the other classes
[10:36:43] <Velveeta> just create a new css entry in your css files for .ui-dialog-title { 4 new properties/values }
[10:36:52] <Velveeta> then you don't have to add/remove any classes
[10:36:55] <bberry> true
[10:36:59] <Velveeta> you just merge your properties into theirs
[10:37:18] <Velveeta> anything that can be done natively with css should always be done natively with css
[10:37:34] <BillCriswell> Yeah, as long as your styles come after and they're as specific that's the best way by far.
[10:37:45] <bberry> cool
[10:37:51] <Velveeta> only deal with adding/editing properties with js if it's something more dynamic, like positioning something at something else, like a tooltip, or programmatically adding/removing class names to reflect state
[10:38:31] <bberry> lets say i have like width:500 in c1. and then i have width:600 in c2. and i do <div class="c1 c2">, does c2 take precedence?
[10:38:43] <snover> no
[10:38:55] <snover> the one that is later in your stylesheet takes precedence
[10:38:55] <Velveeta> it depends on what order those css rules are listed
[10:39:00] <BillCriswell> It depends on the order it shows up, if it shows up after yes.
[10:39:11] <bberry> ahhhh i see.
[10:39:11] <BillCriswell> 3 of the same answers... we're all right.
[10:39:12] <Velveeta> not the order the class names are listed on the element, but rather in your css files
[10:39:14] <snover> triple-confirmed.
[10:39:15] <bberry> lol
[10:39:27] <bberry> yeah. interesting...
[10:41:00] <bpatterson> greetings
[10:41:01] <decx> if you have ".parent .c1" that will override ".c2" though
[10:41:10] <decx> regardless of position in the css
[10:41:17] <Velveeta> right, due to specificity
[10:41:25] <snover> css is so great and not complicated
[10:41:38] <bberry> it has a learning curve
[10:41:38] <Velveeta> and on that note... try to never use !important for an override... always override with specificity unless it's unavoidable
[10:42:05] <bberry> and since theres like a bunch of ways of doing positioning
[10:42:07] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta speaks truth
[10:42:10] <bberry> i think theres a lot of 'bad' ways to do it
[10:42:14] <decx> that's important to note as many ui styles have a billion layers of specificity
[10:42:14] <Velveeta> snover: yeah, wait till css 4 comes out with its parent-targeting and arbitrary node targeting in the middle of selector strings and all sorts of other craziness :D
[10:42:19] <bberry> Velveeta: haha yeah i made that mistake earlier :/
[10:42:34] <bberry> Velveeta: before i knew it i had !important on a ton of properties, and it just got too hairy
[10:42:34] <BillCriswell> So many bad and good ways to do everything. That's what makes everything so awesome and terrible.
[10:42:42] <bberry> haha true enough
[10:42:48] <bberry> esp w/ javascript
[10:42:55] <Velveeta> exactly
[10:42:57] <bpatterson> I am trying to do something and googling on this takes me to huge jquery image slideshow systems. What I want to do is more basic, significantly...
[10:43:09] <decx> #jquery brought to you by joy and despair
[10:43:14] <Velveeta> once you start using !important, you have to override with !important + specificity, so you might as well just not even start, and stick to specificity :D
[10:43:43] <BillCriswell> Wasn't there some weird thing where if you do like .className.className.className like 256 times it'll override important?
[10:43:50] <decx> yes
[10:44:06] <bpatterson> I have two divs stacked vertically. One is very short. I want to expand the height of the div and have it push the div above it upwards, as it expands. Is this a simple process w/ jquery?
[10:44:14] <BillCriswell> I thought that was only a nightmare.
[10:44:15] <decx> that's probably what !important does behind the scenes ^^
[10:44:25] <Velveeta> gross
[10:44:39] <duch_kazatel> actually css selectors use math for specificity  iiirc.
[10:44:44] <duch_kazatel> there's this weird computation that happens.
[10:44:48] <Velveeta> bpatterson: you'd have to use an animation with a step function, or dual animations
[10:45:08] <Velveeta> bpatterson: i've had to do that before, and it was a pretty gross solution, but yes, it can be done
[10:45:26] <Velveeta> in your animation step function, the amount you're expanding 1 container, you subtract from the height of its partner
[10:45:26] <decx> like an accordion without the bop at the bottom?
[10:45:29] <bpatterson> so having a div push another div is a hairy thing?
[10:45:51] <bpatterson> I want the top unit to keep its height
[10:45:59] <bpatterson> just slide up as teh bottom one gets taller
[10:46:10] <duch_kazatel> well that's unique.
[10:46:33] <Velveeta> then you may want to do a translateY as you grow the other container
[10:47:04] <bpatterson> a translate
[10:47:21] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:48:08] <Velveeta> it's cheaper than adjusting the position.top value
[10:48:43] <decx> if you've never done anything with translate3d it can be a bit hard to get into
[10:49:19] <decx> harder than a position based solution at least
[10:50:15] <bpatterson> never have
[10:50:19] <bpatterson> this is in the ballpark: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9199683/animating-one-div-that-causes-another-to-move
[10:52:55] <decx> a working but far from perfect solution is in that thread
[10:53:13] <decx> check how much your lower div grows and add that as a nevagtive margin-top for the upper div
[10:53:40] <decx> nevagtive? the hell
[10:53:53] <ankurk_> decx needs a coffee :P
[10:54:09] <decx> i need food but the kitchen has to be cleaned first :(
[10:54:26] <ankurk_> then order food :P
[10:54:36] <decx> just gonna get some burgers at the "holzkohlegrille"
[10:54:41] <decx> -e
[10:55:23] <ankurk_> never heard of this before o.O
[10:56:30] <decx> it's a little shop down the street with a giant grill over charcoal
[10:56:40] <decx> well not a shop, more like a tent
[10:57:33] <decx> they do fresh burgers which are bigger, cheaper and better than comparable mcdonalds or burgerking stuff
[10:57:45] <decx> we don't have all these fancy chains with the good stuff in germany -.-
[10:58:20] <Hyperking> whats the difference between writing an object and a class with javascript?
[10:58:31] <decx> there are no classes in js
[10:58:52] <Hyperking> what is foo = function(){...}
[10:59:03] <yaymukund> that's a function object
[10:59:09] <decx> that's a named function
[10:59:27] <Hyperking> what is function foo(){...}
[10:59:36] <decx> same thing
[10:59:51] <decx> var foo can only be referenced after it's been declared though
[10:59:53] <duch_kazatel> var foo = function(){...} ius a function expression
[11:00:22] <Hyperking> ok, so what about foo.bar = function(){..} ??
[11:00:50] <decx> that's object literal and like var for = { bar: function() { } }
[11:00:52] <saganbyte> what could be a scenario that dragenter is not triggered but dragleave can be triggered
[11:00:58] <bpatterson> actually
[11:01:03] <bpatterson> testing it out in web inspector...
[11:01:04] <decx> foo*
[11:01:05] <duch_kazatel> that's a function expression whose value is stored in the bar prop of the foo object
[11:01:05] <Hyperking> is bar a nested function within foo ?
[11:01:16] <duch_kazatel> foo is an object - bar is a property on that object.
[11:01:20] <bpatterson> I can do this by simultaneously expanding the height on both divs at the same time
[11:01:34] <bpatterson> can I expand two divs at the same time with a smooth transition
[11:01:37] <bpatterson> with some ease?
[11:01:57] <Hyperking> ok, thanks! im learning
[11:02:25] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking check this out: http://stackoverflow.com/a/13481152/923919
[11:02:43] <duch_kazatel> var foo = function bar() { ... } is a named function expression.
[11:02:49] <duch_kazatel> function foo() { ... } is a function declaration
[11:02:49] <yaymukund> Hyperking: you'd do well to learn about 1) scoping in JS, and 2) prototypal v. classical inheritance if you haven't already. For stuff like this, I think a top-down picture is more helpful than poking around, but ymmv.
[11:02:58] <duch_kazatel> and var foo = function() { ... } is an anonymous function expression
[11:03:09] <decx> you can put anything you want in an object. var foo = { stuff: 'yep', bar: function(){ console.log(foo.stuff) // yep } }
[11:04:06] <Hyperking> yaymukund: poking around is exactly what im doing. I learn best from hacking and breaking stuff :-)
[11:04:56] <decx> it's 7pm and i put on pants for the first time today
[11:05:25] <BillCriswell> decx: Living the dream.
[11:05:43] <BillCriswell> Did your coworkers say anything about it? Mine always get weird.
[11:05:48] <ankurk_> decx I envy you
[11:06:06] <duch_kazatel> okay - this.prop['prepend'])(this.errormessage) - what the shit.
[11:06:20] <drej> BillCriswell yeah wtf is up with that
[11:06:26] <decx> the beauty and curse of working from home
[11:06:27] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: you're the man :-) all that work and I decided to go with a python preprocessor
[11:06:28] <duch_kazatel> err, this.prop['prepend'](this.errormessage) - what in the world is going on here.
[11:06:29] <drej> every time i come to work without pants, people are all freaking out
[11:06:41] <decx> ying&yang and all that jazz
[11:06:47] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: always good learngin something new
[11:07:12] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: Haha nice. I had a feeling gulp might not be right for the task you had at hand but figured you'd want to mess with it anyway.
[11:07:26] <BillCriswell> drej: Bunch of prudes.
[11:08:05] <drej> BillCriswell i say you and i start a new company
[11:08:08] <drej> pantlesswebdev.com
[11:08:46] <ankurk_> I want to join too :P
[11:08:56] <drej> ankurk_ there's an interview process
[11:09:05] <drej> that involves evaluation of personal hygiene
[11:09:10] <duch_kazatel> i'd be down for pantsless webdev'ing
[11:09:12] <drej> and amount of leg/asscrack hair
[11:09:27] * Velveeta peeks over his monitor.
[11:09:33] <bpatterson> so how do I simply animate the vertical expansion of a div's height?
[11:09:35] <Velveeta> did somebody say leg/asscrack hair?
[11:09:42] <Velveeta> now you're speakin my language
[11:09:44] <BillCriswell> Yeah that's big... a pantless work environment is risky, but it could be completely awesome.
[11:09:48] <bpatterson> is that a simple stateent someone could show?
[11:09:53] <ankurk_> *starts getting ready*
[11:10:03] <Velveeta> bpatterson: i have a demo i'm working on for you
[11:10:17] <bpatterson> ahh you are the man
[11:10:19] <bpatterson> again
[11:16:42] <duch_kazatel> this.prop['a string']('another string') - what in the world is going on here, because my mind is breaking.
[11:17:24] <teasercss> hello is there a way to execture javascript before the dom is ready ?
[11:17:42] <Woet> teasercss: what are you actually trying to do?
[11:17:48] <duch_kazatel> teasercss you can execute it without waiting for the DOM, but that's a strange-ass question.
[11:18:00] <mahlon> duch_kazatel: this.prop == an associative array, key is 'a string', value is a function reference.  Calling the reference with 'another string' as the argument.
[11:19:02] <duch_kazatel> mahlon interesting.  he's the funk: this only breaks in jquery 1.11 and NOT 1.8.3
[11:19:07] <teasercss> @Woet have a page with a lot of element , but for one day I want an image to appear on top of it , something like that
[11:19:10] <teasercss> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rufAd/
[11:19:28] <duch_kazatel> i'm familiar with the object property and the expression there, but slapping one right after the other seemed odd.
[11:19:36] <teasercss> @Woet the only thing is that i am able to see whats behind when i execute the page
[11:19:46] <Woet> teasercss: why can't you do this with CSS?
[11:20:05] <Velveeta> ok, that took me entirely too long to get working properly
[11:20:10] <Velveeta> but here you go bpatterson: http://jsfiddle.net/99vDD/
[11:21:12] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaah.  mahlon I've got it.  i are being the dumb :)
[11:21:40] <thebope> Hi, I'm trying to use videojs. Everything works fine in Chrome however this line is causing an error in firefox "$("video[id^='videoPlayer']").get(0).load();" (TypeError: $(...).get(...) is undefined)
[11:22:06] <duch_kazatel> thebope what does $("video[id^='videoPlayer']"); get you?
[11:22:06] <mahlon> duch_kazatel: It's definitely a 'not pretty' way to call it -- if the lookiup fails you're calling "null( 'another string' )" which clearly won't work  :)
[11:22:22] <duch_kazatel> mahlon yep - that's a really convoluted function call.
[11:22:22] <thebope> the videoplayer
[11:22:33] <thebope> let me follow in chrome and see the object
[11:22:47] <Velveeta> you should follow it in firefox, since that's where you're having the issue
[11:22:48] <duch_kazatel> thebope so when you console.log() that in chrome you're getting the player?
[11:22:57] <duch_kazatel> err, in FF.
[11:23:13] <thebope> oh good call let me try in both
[11:23:33] <Velveeta> also.. just for fun..... that tag is supposed to be present at load time right? it's not anything that's dynamically injected by some other process is it?
[11:23:45] <Velveeta> and the code that's trying to reference it is inside of a document.ready wrapper?
[11:23:55] <bpatterson> in jqueryspeak how do I say "if div2 is not in mouseover state"
[11:23:55] <bpatterson> ?
[11:24:07] <bpatterson> to set that conditional
[11:24:13] <Velveeta> bpatterson: $('div2:not(:hover)') maybe?
[11:24:18] <thebope> duch_kazatel, in chrome i get the video
[11:24:21] <thebope> lets see in firefox
[11:24:21] <bpatterson> hm thanks
[11:24:37] <Velveeta> i'm not positive that will work
[11:24:39] <Velveeta> but you can try it
[11:25:18] <teasercss> @Woet not sure what you mean
[11:25:24] <thebope> in chrome I do not
[11:25:50] <thebope> but in chrome I get the video without the get(0)
[11:25:51] <Velveeta> in firefox* ?
[11:26:17] <thebope> I mean yea in firefox
[11:26:25] <thebope> thanks Velveeta
[11:26:32] <Velveeta> the .get(0) is supposed to return a reference to the raw dom node, versus the jquery-wrapped instance of it
[11:26:49] <Velveeta> so it would seem that something is out of whack w/ firefox's loading of that video element
[11:27:07] <Velveeta> so is that pushed out as part of the content of the page, or injected by something else? (client-side template, ajax, something else?)
[11:27:21] <thebope> videojs generates it actualyly
[11:27:32] <BillCriswell> Ugh, overflow-y: hidden isn't working in mobile webkit. Good times.
[11:27:45] <thebope> The firefox I use is older because I need it to work with certain selenium plug ins
[11:27:49] <thebope> let me send it to a friend and have him try
[11:27:55] <Velveeta> videojs generates the actual video element?
[11:28:02] <Velveeta> or the javascript that's trying to reference it?
[11:29:34] <thebope> Velveeta, the video element is there
[11:29:35] <bpatterson> ok http://pastebin.com/xNLzB8cu
[11:29:45] <bpatterson> trying to say "Don't execute of #lower1 is in hover / mouseover."
[11:29:47] <thebope> and then videojs generates a bunch of stuff
[11:29:49] <Velveeta> thebope: at load time?
[11:29:55] <bpatterson> that piece didn't work earlier btw
[11:29:57] <bpatterson> vel
[11:29:57] <thebope> videoPlayer is not
[11:30:00] <thebope> no
[11:30:08] <thebope> that is generated by videojs
[11:30:09] <Velveeta> the video element itself
[11:30:14] <Velveeta> ok
[11:30:24] <thebope> <video...> is though yes
[11:30:32] <thebope> wait
[11:30:33] <thebope> one sec
[11:30:54] <Velveeta> ok, so that's what i mean, the actual <video> tag is available as part of the initial page load
[11:31:15] <thebope> Velveeta, okay, so the video element is there but videojs modifies it
[11:31:39] <Velveeta> right, but it's not modifying it due to not finding it for some reason
[11:31:43] <thebope> Although the id, which is modified, still would match the selector provided which is id starts with videoPlayer
[11:31:52] <Velveeta> what happens if, from the console, you just type your $() selector string after page load
[11:31:56] <Velveeta> does it find the video tag?
[11:32:14] <thebope> oh it turns it into a div in firefox
[11:32:22] <thebope> That works Velveeta
[11:32:30] <thebope> I get the object
[11:33:20] <Velveeta> bpatterson: i'm brainstorming, btw
[11:33:22] <Hyperking> whats the difference between Java, Javascript and Jquery
[11:33:26] <Velveeta> still trying to wade through what you posted there
[11:33:37] <duch_kazatel> java and javascript are two different languages.
[11:33:52] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a library for javascript that provides a lot of utilities and abstractions for you.
[11:33:52] <Velveeta> hyperking: yeah, java and javascript have nothing to do with each other, like python and javascript
[11:34:06] <thebope> duch_kazatel,  and Velveeta , thanks for working with me here
[11:34:15] <Velveeta> thebope: no problemo
[11:34:23] <Velveeta> so you say it's turning your video tag into a div tag?
[11:34:28] <Velveeta> in firefox?
[11:34:28] <thebope> yea
[11:34:31] <Velveeta> interesting
[11:34:38] <thebope> Can I do the id^= without the video in front of it?
[11:34:41] <thebope> Thats what I'm trying now
[11:34:42] <Hyperking> velveeta: like python is Java a server side language?
[11:34:42] <Velveeta> yep
[11:35:01] <duch_kazatel> javascript can also be run server side! :D
[11:35:15] <Velveeta> hyperking: the only thing java and javascript have in common is the word java... it leads a lot of people to think they're related.. java and javascript are no more related than python and js, or php and js, or c++ and js
[11:35:25] <bpatterson> ty
[11:35:25] <Velveeta> and yes, thank you for that, node ;)
[11:35:31] <ankurk_> Don't you think JavaScript should be renamed?
[11:35:35] <duch_kazatel> even better - you can also run javascript IN java.
[11:35:42] <Velveeta> you could always call it ecmascript
[11:35:49] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ that goes back to the fact that javascript is just the name of an implementation.
[11:36:20] <thebope> yea that works in the console
[11:36:40] <thebope> okay, lets see if this works, of course theres a div and a object that id^=videoPlayer
[11:36:42] <Velveeta> thebope: so if you change your actual code to use that selector without the video prefix, does it work in FF and chrome?
[11:36:57] <thebope> One sec, reloading
[11:37:00] <Velveeta> ok
[11:37:49] <Desode> Is there anyone here that has experience with both jquery and Drupal? I'm trying to make a jquery plugin work in Drupal but to no avail.
[11:37:53] <aaas> newbie ?:  I'm selecting an element $(#panel2-2) and I would like to target an immediate child iframe, I think i've tried every variant, I can get it with children() but isn't there a way to just specify 'iframe' to target? http://pastebin.com/EaqLCdUb
[11:38:09] <Velveeta> bpatterson: i'm drawin a blank here right now, at a cross-browser solution
[11:38:34] <ankurk_> aaas: give iframe an id, and then target it
[11:38:53] <thebope> what a pain
[11:38:55] <duch_kazatel> aaas $('#panel2-2 iframe') ?
[11:39:11] <duch_kazatel> or $('#panel2-2').children('iframe') ?
[11:39:30] <aaas> duch_kazatel  yeah maybe your second one..the first didnt work
[11:39:46] <duch_kazatel> the first should work unless you have invalid markup.
[11:39:54] <aaas> maybe thats it
[11:39:57] <duch_kazatel> the first selects all iframes inside of #panel2-2
[11:40:08] <aaas> ankurk_ thanks but im trying to avoid and id to make it more general
[11:41:06] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel's second option should work
[11:41:55] <aaas> duch_kazatel ok i think i supidly put the quote in the wrong place..is there a way to do it with the 'this' keyword?  $(this 'iframe')?
[11:42:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:42:07] <Velveeta> not like that
[11:42:15] <Velveeta> you could do $(this).find('iframe')
[11:42:17] <aaas> ah
[11:42:19] <thebope> Velveeta, trying video[id^=...], object[id^=...]
[11:42:20] <aaas> ok thanks
[11:42:34] <Velveeta> thebope: you said it turned it into a div though, right? not an object...
[11:44:59] <thebope> theres a div surrounding an object
[11:45:22] <Velveeta> ok
[11:45:31] <bpatterson> hmm ya?
[11:46:35] <bpatterson> Really now if I can just add the conditional (re: the pastebin I pasted) that says "don't exec this function of #lower1 is in hover" - then I would be fine I think
[11:47:17] <Velveeta> right, that's the part that's a bit more difficult to do in a cross-browser way
[11:47:39] <thebope> npothing
[11:48:31] <bpatterson> I thoguht that was part of the magic of jquery
[11:48:43] <bpatterson> however it determines hover covers most browsersr
[11:48:50] <bpatterson> vs doing js directly
[11:49:14] <Velveeta> that is part of the beauty of jquery, that :hover as a js selector is a little spotty
[11:49:20] <decx> if (!$('.stuf ).is(':hover'))
[11:49:27] <decx> '.stuff'
[11:50:25] <Velveeta> here's a SO article that explains it a little more: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8010267/jquery-condition-check-ishover-not-working
[11:50:55] <Velveeta> although since you have an id on that element, you may be able to do what the upvoted answer suggests
[11:51:04] <Velveeta> if ($('#lower:hover').length)
[11:51:34] <bpatterson> decx: This, basically? http://pastebin.com/gfcD3DPR
[11:52:02] <duch_kazatel> anybody know of any changes to $.fn.append, $.fn.prepend from 1.8.3 to 1.11 ?
[11:52:33] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: not off the top of my head, are you seeing unexpected behavior?
[11:52:38] <decx> well apparently :hover isn't cross browser safe bpatterson
[11:52:41] <duch_kazatel> very unexpected behavior.
[11:53:14] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: are you expecting append/prepend to turn 59 into 5.9 for you?
[11:53:20] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta hahahahahahahaha
[11:53:22] <decx> this looks liek something you'd do in css anyway
[11:53:28] <Velveeta> :D
[11:53:49] <decx> lol
[11:53:56] <decx> that 5.9 thing will bring us joy for weeks
[11:54:05] <Velveeta> heheheh
[11:54:34] <decx> we should all write ridiculous plugins
[11:54:37] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/kVk2Q/
[11:54:52] <decx> it's gonna be this channels 2048 ;)
[11:55:43] <duch_kazatel> wait this traces all the way back to underscore. what the shit.
[11:56:39] <Velveeta> shit...... http://emils.github.io/2048-multiplayer/
[11:56:46] <duch_kazatel> NO. NONONONONO
[11:56:57] <decx> yeah i didnt even click on that
[11:57:03] <decx> gotta do work some time
[11:57:31] <duch_kazatel> i should make a script that crawls github for 2048 clones and submits a pull request that deletes everything in the repo.
[11:57:44] <Velveeta> lol
[12:00:04] <Velveeta> somebody has this shit hooked up to 2048-AI or something... people can't react as fast as this player.. he's up to a 256 tile with multiple 64's in under a minute
[12:00:16] <duch_kazatel> niiiice
[12:08:29] <Velveeta> how lame, that game is on a timer, so the person with the most points at the end of a minute or so wins, so that only encourages button mashing to score quickly and then sit and wait for time to expire
[12:12:48] <thebope> Velveeta, duch_kazatel, on the off chance it would exist I tried joining #video-js and it actually did. A guy in there told me to use their api instead of accessing the objects directly
[12:12:57] <thebope> in retrospect... that's probably a better default move anyways
[12:13:06] <thebope> It seems to be working, I'm getting closer at lease
[12:17:17] <Desode> Is there anyone here that has experience with both jquery and Drupal? I'm trying to make a jquery plugin work in Drupal but to no avail.
[12:17:43] <mikeche1en> !question
[12:17:50] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Desode
[12:17:50] <b-ot> Desode: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:17:56] <mikeche1en> ty duch
[12:18:19] <duch_kazatel> i run a copy of ecmabot at work.  lovely little bugger.
[12:18:48] <ankurk_> I have a question, What makes a good front end engineer? :)
[12:19:07] <Desode> duch_kazatel: Ok then: I'm trying to make colio (http://bit.ly/1kNT3fk) work with Drupal Views and Isotope, but I'm not sure how
[12:20:47] <duch_kazatel> how far have you gotten?
[12:21:02] <duch_kazatel> and where is the documentation?
[12:21:58] <Velveeta> you know what's tasty? deer chili with fresh diced onions and cheese and sour cream and cornbread crumbled into it
[12:22:14] <Desode> Documentation for Colio can be found here:  http://plugins.gravitysign.com/colio/docs/  Isotope is available as a module for Drupal; I got that up and running
[12:22:54] <ankurk_> deer chilli?
[12:23:09] <Velveeta> yep
[12:23:24] <duch_kazatel> Desode it looks like you need to render out a page that has all the markup colio needs and then go from there.
[12:25:42] <craysiii> can I emulate data-role=page in twitter boostrap?
[12:28:12] <masscrx> what is the difference between .change and .select with dropdown ?
[12:29:01] <duch_kazatel> different events.
[12:29:36] <masscrx> ok i have dropdown with Prompt "select item", when I click ang select option1, which event is fired?
[12:29:37] <duch_kazatel> select is when you select text in an input.
[12:29:40] <duch_kazatel> change.
[12:29:47] <duch_kazatel> change is fired when you change any input.
[12:30:39] <masscrx> https://gist.github.com/masscrx/7ded065d87f108d4dbd1
[12:30:43] <masscrx> I have this little code
[12:30:56] <duch_kazatel> for those who were following my saga earlier - $(document).prepend(); was my issue
[12:31:14] <masscrx> and I want to make ajax call when some option is selected, but no action when user select "prompt"
[12:31:29] <Velveeta> duch: vs something like $('body').prepend?
[12:31:44] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta yeah.  apparently in 1.8, $(document).prepend(); is totally legit.
[12:31:54] <duch_kazatel> masscrx can you make a more complete example in a fiddle?
[12:32:01] <Velveeta> masscrx: the 'select item' option is still an option with a non-null value, even if it's an empty string
[12:32:24] <masscrx> so change != null to != "" ?
[12:32:33] <Velveeta> right
[12:32:44] <Velveeta> if your 'select item' option has value ""
[12:45:51] <sunbeam> whats the best way to get the total width of the first 6 <li> of a <ul> ?
[12:46:58] <duch_kazatel> you mean add together the width?
[12:47:21] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: yes the total width of those elements
[12:47:34] <duch_kazatel> before i answer that - what are you trying to do?>
[12:48:21] <sunbeam> just need to debug something
[12:48:44] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you could iterate through them and get the width of each.
[12:49:36] <sunbeam> yep i see but isnt there a better way?
[12:49:39] <Velveeta> li's are block level are they not?
[12:49:43] <duch_kazatel> "a better way"
[12:49:46] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[12:49:47] <Velveeta> shouldn't they all be the same width?
[12:50:12] <duch_kazatel> sure, unless they're doing something wonky and having cross-browser issues.
[12:50:38] <djBuss> hey guys, does anyone have experience with jaquery mobile and data-direction ? I'm trying to change it dynamically. not working
[12:51:20] <sunbeam> Velveeta: of course depending on their contenty
[12:51:22] <sunbeam> content
[12:51:32] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam then why are you adding them together?
[12:53:25] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam the issue is that the question is very strange
[12:53:41] <sunbeam> Need to test something
[12:53:50] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't help.
[12:53:54] <duch_kazatel> what are you testing?
[12:54:03] <duch_kazatel> a more complete picture of what you're doing would be helpful.
[12:55:16] <Velveeta> so apparently the native display of an li is "list-item", but they're treated as block by the browser
[12:55:24] <Velveeta> so yeah, they should all be the same width
[12:55:31] <Velveeta> regardless of their content
[12:55:56] <Velveeta> if you want the widths of the individual snippets of content, you may have to wrap them in an inline element of some kind and measure that
[12:56:39] <djBuss> Is it possible to change the value of data-** in jquerymobile ? or it doesn't work for the first time ?
[12:57:01] <djBuss> Is it possible to change the value of data-** in jquerymobile ? or it just works for the first time ?
[12:57:17] <duch_kazatel> djBuss huh?  yeah, you can do .data('name')
[12:57:36] <duch_kazatel> .data('name', 'value');
[12:57:38] <duch_kazatel> just works.
[12:57:46] <djBuss> it changes but doesn't works
[12:57:53] <duch_kazatel> what doesn't work?
[12:58:02] <djBuss> I'm changing data-direction=reverse/forward
[12:58:10] <duch_kazatel> oh the jquery mobile thing - you need to then call the function that handles that info.
[12:58:12] <djBuss> it works only for the first time
[12:58:16] <duch_kazatel> changing the data doesn't call the function.
[12:58:47] <duch_kazatel> bbiab - lunchtime.
[12:58:49] <djBuss> how do I call tis function ?
[12:58:57] <duch_lunch> check the docs.
[12:58:59] <duch_lunch> peace.
[12:59:06] <djBuss> ok thanks
[12:59:17] <ankurk_> you can do this too, .attr('data-attr', 'your value')
[12:59:35] <djBuss> that's what I'm doing, it changes
[12:59:46] <djBuss> but it doesnt follow the value
[13:00:05] <ankurk_> follow the value!?
[13:01:09] <djBuss> say, I start my element like this <a> </a> then throguh jquery i get to <a data-direction='reverse'> </a> then if I change ti to <a data-direction='forward'> </a>
[13:01:30] <djBuss> it doesn't work with the forward
[13:01:45] <djBuss> keeps using the first value set for data-direction
[13:02:23] <Velveeta> try changing the actual data property, not the attribute
[13:02:34] <Velveeta> .data('direction', 'forward') instead of .attr('data-direction', 'forward')
[13:02:50] <djBuss> I was checking the jqmData
[13:02:54] <djBuss> and it changes too
[13:03:09] <djBuss> but I will try that then
[13:03:20] <djBuss> I need to use jqmData instead of data right ?
[13:04:53] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what jqmData is, i don't use jquery mobile
[13:05:17] <djBuss> it's supposed to be the data for jquery mobile
[13:05:26] <djBuss> thanks I will try that
[13:06:49] <Velveeta> that's kind of weird that they have their own decorator function for .data(), i'll investigate what it's for
[13:08:06] <Velveeta> ok, you should be using jqmData() probably
[13:08:21] <Velveeta> looks like all it does is decorate the data() functions to add namespace support for jqm
[13:08:36] <Velveeta> but i'm gonna guess all jqm plugins and whatnot use that for their gets/sets
[13:08:50] <djBuss> ok, thanks
[13:10:51] <william|laptop> Hello, second day of javascript. Expereience with jQuery mobile have been awesome, like the language so far. Now I'm troubled with the task of trying to get a menu to close.
[13:10:59] <william|laptop> I've put the code to my webapp thus far here: http://account.lbsg.net/app/www/index.html
[13:11:06] <william|laptop> Still having some resizing issues on the background, those can be fixed later.
[13:11:13] <william|laptop> The side menu works great in the top upper right hand corner of each page.
[13:11:18] <william|laptop> However, I can't seem to figure out how to get the menu to close when the user taps on something.
[13:11:25] <william|laptop> Any ideas on what event I should be handling, and in what way?
[13:21:34] <Sirisian|Work> I just found a fun bug in my code. So my code is executed inside of an iframe that is randomly set to display:none causing all my width() and height() calls in jquery to return 0. Is there a way to set the iframe to display: block or something while I call things?
[13:24:49] <decx> i'm pretty sure width() doesn't care if it's set to display: none
[13:26:57] <Sirisian|Work> decx, http://jsfiddle.net/42MPM/
[13:27:09] <Sirisian|Work> I think I solved it by binding a resize event maybe. hmm
[13:47:36] <alex^> does anyone have any idea of why i can't use .html()  to insert a block of css code?  like  <style>...</style>   .. i can insert anything else, any html etc, but if i try to include a <style> block, the whole element just becomes empty
[13:47:58] <alex^> this only happens on one site of mine, most other sites it works fine on
[13:51:55] <gblair> @alex^ perhaps it's a different version of jquery?
[14:00:14] <alex^> gblair, no, its the same version .. weird thing is it works fine if i use the basic innerhtml() method
[14:00:46] <alex^> almost like jquery.html() had been modified to blank out the string if it contains a <style> block
[14:00:56] <alex^> but its not of course
[14:10:24] <YokoBR> hi guys, i'm getting wrong chars passing vars by GET. it comes with a lot of %22, like id%22%3A282455389%7D&session_id=&_=1395435835966
[14:11:03] <alex^> YokoBR, its url-encoded.  url-decode it
[14:11:20] <YokoBR> how, pls?
[14:11:35] <alex^> google url decode
[14:12:09] <duch_kazatel> !g url decode mdn
[14:12:10] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: decodeURI() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURI
[14:12:33] <duch_kazatel> there's also this:

[14:12:38] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: decodeURIComponent() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent
[14:15:21] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: We should set up something like thinkful.com, charge a much lower rate and conduct classes right in IRC.
[14:16:14] <duch_kazatel> oooh.
[14:16:16] <craysiii> can I emulate data-role=page in twitter boostrap?
[14:16:22] <duch_kazatel> cars huh?
[14:16:34] <duch_kazatel> err, craysiii
[14:16:45] <craysiii> ?
[14:16:56] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean "emulate data-role=page"?
[14:17:35] <BillCriswell> I'm out of here!
[14:17:36] <craysiii> sorry i typed it wrong. what I mean is emulate the inline pages of jquery-mobile in twitter bootstrap or just using jsquery
[14:17:47] <duch_kazatel> still not following.
[14:18:07] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to make a mobile site like you would with jquery mobile, but using just bootstrap?
[14:18:18] <duch_kazatel> and/or jquery?
[14:18:48] <craysiii> no. I mean i want to emulate a specific feature of jquery mobile (pages http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.0a4.1/docs/pages/docs-pages.html) in bootstrap or just using jquery
[14:19:01] <duch_kazatel> craysiii get away from the "emulate" concept.
[14:19:22] <duch_kazatel> you want to replicate a feature.  the answer is "yes, with enough work"
[14:19:50] <sunbeam> how can I just target chrome with jquery, anyone?
[14:19:52] <craysiii> well yes I could write it myself if I really wanted to, im just seeing if someone already had a solution they'd like to share
[14:20:32] <duch_kazatel> why not just use jquery mobile?
[14:20:42] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam you can't with recent versions.
[14:20:47] <craysiii> i dont want another dependency.
[14:20:49] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam they removed browser detection for a good reason.
[14:21:05] <arschmitz> craysiii: pages are kinda the main concept of jquery mobile
[14:21:15] <duch_kazatel> arschmitz beat me to it :)_
[14:21:35] <duch_kazatel> pages are a big part of the point.  that's one of reasons people use it.  bootstrap won't have anything like that.
[14:22:06] <craysiii> thats all i wanted to know
[14:22:21] <craysiii> ty.
[14:22:28] <duch_kazatel> woah and this bug has come full circle.  So you can't do $(document).append(); in older versions of jquery, but newer versions actually throw an error.
[14:22:30] <arschmitz> pages are inda the WHOLE point realy we have already publicly said all normal widget will be moving to jquery ui and mobile will be just a navigation framework in the future
[14:22:39] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: hmm
[14:22:44] <duch_kazatel> arschmitz huh?
[14:22:55] <duch_kazatel> arschmitz where did that get assounced?
[14:22:55] <arschmitz> duch_kazatel: jquery mobile and ui are merging
[14:23:08] <arschmitz> mostly conference keynotes
[14:23:18] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam what are you doing that you think you need browser detection for
[14:23:18] <arschmitz> issues
[14:23:23] <arschmitz> meeting notes
[14:23:28] <bpatterson> thanks today
[14:23:30] <arschmitz> etc
[14:23:31] <craysiii> I stepped away from scripting and development for a couple years, bear with me.
[14:23:39] <duch_kazatel> craysiii of course :)
[14:23:49] <arschmitz> duch_kazatel: we are already working towards this
[14:24:18] <duch_kazatel> i hadn't heard anything which is why i'm confused.
[14:24:25] <arschmitz> ui and mobile are working on a new shared themeing system
[14:24:33] <arschmitz> and all the normal widgets will become part of ui
[14:24:43] <decx> arschmitz great to hear, i looked at the jqm builder and made a stripped down version as you said and most of my jqm prejudices were eliminated when only using some behaviour parts
[14:24:46] <arschmitz> and will work everywhere and support mobile devices
[14:24:59] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[14:25:04] <arschmitz> and mobile will be all the page and nav stuff
[14:25:28] <arschmitz> and a new shared custom builder will allow you to do a custom build including elements of both
[14:25:46] <arschmitz> this is all work in progress but it is the direction which the libraries are heading
[14:25:55] <duch_kazatel> cool
[14:26:56] <arschmitz> duch_kazatel: yeah i dont think we have done a blog post or anything about it yet
[14:27:05] <duch_kazatel> are you on the core team?
[14:27:08] <arschmitz> should probably do one at some point
[14:27:21] <duch_kazatel> ah, whois is revealing :)
[14:27:56] <arschmitz> lol
[14:28:02] <arschmitz> im the development lead of jquery mobile
[14:28:08] <duch_kazatel> yep.  saw that :)
[14:28:38] <craysiii> we are graced by his presence :P
[14:29:18] <arschmitz> lol im always here just nor normally paying attention because im working
[14:29:26] <arschmitz> nor == not
[14:31:45] <Ownix> I think im making this harder than it is which is why I cant figure this out
[14:31:57] <Ownix> Is there any way to sort a bunch of <li> tags based on their data-weight?
[14:32:31] <Ownix> So I have this <ul><li data-weight="2"/><li data-weight="1"/><li data-weight="3"/></ul> and I have to sort them
[14:34:12] <duch_kazatel> Ownix check out http://stackoverflow.com/a/13490529/923919
[14:34:18] <duch_kazatel> see if that kicks you in the right direction.
[14:34:45] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: that should be a big help. Thanks a lot
[14:34:50] <duch_kazatel> Ownix of course :)
[14:38:33] <duch_kazatel> arschmitz you might know something about this - do you know what was changed so when you try to do things like .append() on $(document) it throws an error?
[14:38:56] <arschmitz> duch_kazatel: i would need more context
[14:39:44] <arschmitz> and append to document does not really make sense pick an actual element
[14:39:50] <duch_kazatel> i'm well aware :)
[14:40:11] <duch_kazatel> In old versions of jquery, if you do $(document).append('anything here'); it wouldn't do anything, not even error.  In more recent verions (probably 1.9+), doing that nets an error.
[14:40:37] <arschmitz> oh id have to check im not aware of the exact details of that
[14:40:59] <arschmitz> but it sounds like the new behavior makes more sense anyway
[14:41:04] <duch_kazatel> all right.  not a huge deal - i'm actually happy it throws an error now.  just wondering what changed.
[14:41:37] <arschmitz> id have to dig into it im not sure off the top of my head
[14:42:30] <tables> does anyone know of any javascript email clients out there
[14:42:32] <duch_kazatel> no worries.
[14:42:39] <tables> something like thunderbird made with js
[14:42:53] <duch_kazatel> looks like it.
[14:45:57] <craysiii> so now i made a very simple example with jquery-mobile, but when it loads from page to page, the contents seem to drift down a pixel or two after it is loaded, is this normal?
[14:46:12] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:46:58] <craysiii> when the page renders, the text i have "about" drifts down a pixel or two after a second of being on the page
[14:47:20] <craysiii> i can take a video of it i guess.
[14:48:02] <duch_kazatel> you mean it drifts down more and more each time?  or it snaps into place and then falls a little?
[14:48:10] <craysiii> the latter
[14:48:22] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a styling problem.
[14:48:59] <craysiii> hm i have no styling. maybe jquery mobile and bootstrap conflict?
[14:49:19] <duch_kazatel> it could also just be the initial render.
[14:49:21] <Valesk> I have sort of a noob question. I have about four different scripts I'm running in my footer using <script>code</script> ... should I be placing these into a main.js and just calling that file?
[14:49:47] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[14:50:11] <Valesk> Do I wrap all of them in one $(document).ready tag?
[14:50:47] <duch_kazatel> Valesk huh?  you wrap the contents of the file in a doc ready if you need to.
[14:51:03] <craysiii> yeah doesn't seem to do it when I comment out bootstrap.css
[14:51:07] <Valesk> Okieee
[14:52:23] <duch_kazatel> craysiii sounds like boostrap is doing stuff for ya.
[14:52:47] <craysiii> hmmmm
[14:53:13] <duch_kazatel> what do you need bootstrap for?
[15:00:38] <craysiii> I wanted to use bootstrap's css
[15:01:13] <duch_kazatel> the grid system I'll bet?
[15:01:30] <arschmitz> craysiii: the two are not tested together
[15:01:39] <arschmitz> so while most things should work you may find bugs like that
[15:02:54] <craysiii> grid system among other things
[15:07:54] <craysiii> guess ill live without it
[15:08:07] <duch_kazatel> yeah i wouldn't use it.
[15:09:10] <craysiii> would you have a recommendation for something like it? or just stick with jquery/jquery-mobile/
[15:10:14] <duch_kazatel> i mean if you're making a mobile site, that combo should be plenty.
[15:12:34] <craysiii> im making a phone app with phonegap/cordova
[15:25:10] <sunbeam> how can i best test if var string starts with something- ?
[15:28:19] <araujo> sunbeam, just use js regexp?
[15:29:01] <systemfault> .js /^lol-/.test('lol-rofl');
[15:30:46] <sunbeam> thanks
[15:48:57] <duch_kazatel> almost work beer time
[15:49:23] <Velveeta> yay for work beer!
[15:49:30] <Velveeta> what kind of keg do you guys have for that?
[15:51:03] <jphase> hah, I just got done with our "Virtual Beers" meeting we have every Friday
[15:51:06] <duch_kazatel> Usually Pale Ale.
[15:51:07] <jphase> didn't know it was such a fad
[15:51:16] <duch_kazatel> because we're right next to sierra nevada.
[15:51:20] <jphase> hah! Rockin' Sierra Nevada Pale  myself!
[15:51:23] <duch_kazatel> very nice.
[15:51:28] <jphase> duch_kazatel++;
[15:51:44] <jphase> Chico?
[15:51:46] <duch_kazatel> yep
[15:51:50] <jphase> booya!
[15:52:03] * jphase is from Portland, Oregon originally - now in Ft. Lauderdale
[15:52:07] <duch_kazatel> very nice.
[15:52:13] <jphase> love me some california alcohol
[15:52:17] <jphase> wine/beer/etc.
[15:52:23] <Velveeta> so you moved right down the road, huh
[15:52:31] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta?
[15:52:31] <jphase> oh?
[15:52:37] <jphase> Georgia or something?
[15:52:43] <Velveeta> no, from portland to florida :D
[15:52:46] <duch_kazatel> hah
[15:52:47] <jphase> oh lol
[15:52:55] <duch_kazatel> how much is pale out there these days?
[15:52:57] <Velveeta> i'm in austin myself
[15:53:03] <duch_kazatel> now that there's a new plant in North Carolina.
[15:53:05] <jphase> omg.... $11 a six pack!
[15:53:10] <jphase> plus tax
[15:53:12] <Velveeta> jebus
[15:53:15] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaahahahaha suckers.
[15:53:15] <arschmitz> Velveeta: portland maine or oregon?
[15:53:17] <jphase> yeah... sad
[15:53:21] <jphase> Oregon
[15:53:33] <Velveeta> archmitz: not me, jphase said he'd moved from portland oregon to florida :)
[15:53:36] <duch_kazatel> I get it at like $6 or $7 a 6pack
[15:53:41] <arschmitz> oh sorry
[15:53:47] <jphase> I know :~(   I miss the west coast prices
[15:53:55] <Velveeta> no problemo
[15:53:56] <duch_kazatel> they'll drop soon for you.
[15:54:12] <duch_kazatel> i'm really into Drake's and Stone these days.
[15:54:18] <duch_kazatel> stone's Go To IPA is fantastic.
[15:54:18] <jphase> but I could throw a softball at the atlantic ocean or the intracoastal from my terrace so... it's all good for now
[15:54:29] <jphase> I like me some Lagunitas too
[15:54:31] <Velveeta> IPA is the one category of beer that i just cannot do
[15:54:38] <duch_kazatel> i'm really not a lagunitas fan.
[15:54:44] <jphase> orly? you're more of a stout guy right Velveeta?
[15:55:02] <Velveeta> i can do lambics, i can do lagers, browns and ambers, even stouts, and if pressed, hefes.. but no IPAs :D
[15:55:13] <duch_kazatel> hah.  i'm a huge porter/stout fan myself.
[15:55:17] <Velveeta> my favorite categories are probably browns and ambers
[15:55:27] <jphase> I vaguely remember some conversations about "should I drink this wounded soldier from last night?" conversation with Velveeta
[15:55:28] <Velveeta> breckenridge's vanilla porter is one of my favorites
[15:55:31] <jphase> I was devil's advocate
[15:55:37] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[15:55:47] <duch_kazatel> i love stone's smoked porter.
[15:55:50] <Velveeta> i vaguely remember that too :D
[15:55:51] <jphase> mmmm
[15:56:33] <duch_kazatel> oooh and narhwal from SN.
[15:56:41] <jphase> not familiar with that one
[15:56:42] <duch_kazatel> i got to tour their barrel aging facility recently.
[15:56:47] <duch_kazatel> imperial stout
[15:56:55] <jphase> I miss Rogue <3
[15:57:28] <jphase> $('.beer').nextUntil('#wasted');
[15:58:03] <duch_kazatel> aaaand brb
[15:58:30] <Velveeta> do { this.drink(new Beer()); } until (!this.consciousness);
[15:59:08] <Velveeta> i can't wait for oktoberfest season to roll around again, those my favorites
[15:59:24] <Velveeta> i stumbled across warsteiner's oktoberfest last season, and it was pretty phenomenal
[15:59:38] <decx> i have a big client in munich and get flown down there every few years
[15:59:44] <Velveeta> nice
[15:59:53] <Velveeta> i need to get me a big client in munich :D
[15:59:54] <jphase> pffft
[15:59:58] <jphase> friendship over!
[16:00:02] * jphase = jelly
[16:01:39] <jphase> I want a friend in munich, amsterdam, and the netherlands
[16:01:45] <decx> yeah it's a waste i don't acutally drink much, i can drink half of one of these giant glasses and i'm wasted
[16:02:01] <Velveeta> i imagine the strength over there is a lot higher too
[16:02:08] <jphase> hey, nothin' wrong with being a cheap date :\
[16:02:10] <decx> even higher for oktoberfest
[16:02:19] <jphase> it's fiscally responsible of you decx :D
[16:02:33] <Velveeta> that's decx, always watching out for the bottom line
[16:02:44] <jphase> hehe
[16:03:01] <decx> if you're the only one not unconcious at the end of the day, picking up chicks is much easier
[16:03:31] <Velveeta> heheheh
[16:11:07] <Velveeta> i'm watching the hobbit, and why the hell wouldn't those eagles just fly them all the way to where they needed to go.. what a dick move.......
[16:11:29] <Velveeta> i guess that's why not a single one of that group offered so much as a thank you to them as they flew away.. what a dick move, too.......
[16:11:44] <Velveeta> middle earth is full of dicks
[16:11:46] <systemfault> Well...
[16:11:51] <systemfault> Even for LOTR..
[16:12:57] <systemfault> 1) Give ring to frodo 2) Make frodo fly the bird gandalf used to escape saruman's tower.... 3) Get to mordor with the bird... 4) Drop the stupid ring in the fire 5) Drink & Celebrate
[16:12:57] <inputLoad> hi
[16:13:14] <inputLoad> i have a great difficult ahahahah
[16:13:27] <Velveeta> oh boy! <rubbing his hands together in anticipation>
[16:13:41] * Velveeta slaps each shoulder and swings his arms to loosen them up.
[16:13:44] <inputLoad> why my php (PDO) don't refresh on refresh function load()
[16:13:45] <inputLoad> ?
[16:13:54] <Velveeta> wait, wut
[16:14:40] <jphase> !jQuery
[16:14:54] <enquora> I need to iterate sibling rows in a table, direction depending on parameter passed (up or down) and execute identical code block. Is it possible to assign nextAll() or prevAll() to a variable depending on direction param and use variable as iterator?
[16:15:17] <jphase> enquora: sure
[16:16:34] <enquora> jphase: what is one assigning to the variable?
[16:16:35] <Velveeta> you might have to invoke it with .call or .apply though
[16:16:45] <Velveeta> you would want to assign $.fn.nextAll/prevAll to your variable
[16:17:09] <Velveeta> and when you invoke it, do it like so: myFuncVar.call(myElement, someSelector)
[16:17:22] <enquora> k
[16:18:14] <Velveeta> the other way to do it would be store the function name as a string
[16:18:33] <Velveeta> like var myFunc = 'nextAll'; myElement[myFunc](someSelector);
[16:19:32] <enquora> doesn't one need to call .each() on nextAll to iterate? nextAll is just an object, isn't it?
[16:19:35] <Velveeta> in the first case, using call/apply, you should pass myElement as a raw dom node.. in the 2nd, you'd want myElement to be a jquery-wrapped node
[16:19:49] <Velveeta> no, nextAll is a selector querying function
[16:19:54] <Velveeta> not an iterator
[16:20:15] <enquora> right, so each needs to be called on nextAll, no?
[16:20:17] <Velveeta> in a list of 10 li's, if from li#2, you were to say nextAll(), you would get the other 8 li's
[16:20:41] <Velveeta> yes, nextAll would return a collection of matching nodes, which you would then want to .each() over if you had to iterate over the nodes
[16:20:53] <Velveeta> depending on what you're looking to do
[16:21:36] <enquora> I need to break early, potentially, depending on a comparison of next row to current row. I wonder if I'm better building an array of row objects and iterating over it?
[16:22:22] <Velveeta> it might be more helpful if we knew the actual use case, or could look at an example in jsbin/jsfiddle
[16:23:46] <enquora> Have a table of with rows and columns, use contextmenu on any td to fill contents up or down table, like spreadsheet fill down
[16:24:31] <enquora> Need to stop the copy if certain comparison conditions are met between next row/column to be filled and it's predecessor in the iteration
[16:24:55] <Velveeta> like if it already has a value in it or something
[16:25:34] <jphase> I'm trying to add functionality onto chosen's "optgroups" they create that will select/deselect all when you click them but not sure what other event I could trigger besides click on these:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/QDv7h/   -  they don't seem to have anything that lets me select options in the list without changing the original select element and calling chosen:updated, which closes the box and all that jazz
[16:26:10] <enquora> Velveeta: something like that, yes
[16:26:30] <Velveeta> enquora: is the list of rows dynamic? does it grow/shrink based on other things or ajax calls, or is it static?
[16:27:00] <nhulea> hey so I have this function that checks for duplicate dates http://jsfiddle.net/3BgAP/1/ 99.9% percent of the time it works but I just had someone email me that some one was able to enter 3 of the same date ? can anyone see why this would have happened ?
[16:27:53] <Velveeta> jphase: i'm not familiar w/ chosen, but played with it in that demo a little bit... is it required for the list to be open in order for chosen to render a token for it when the item is clicked?
[16:27:57] <enquora> Each td has an input or content editable element. The user can add new rows, but the table is static when the operation is applied
[16:28:08] <enquora> It's a spreadsheet of sorts
[16:28:41] <jphase> Velveeta: not sure tbh, perhaps I should change to the chosen:open event to see :)
[16:28:45] <enquora> adding a bi-directional fill operation, selectable on any cell
[16:29:32] <Velveeta> jphase: you could try (at the time of clicking on an optgroup title) grabbing all of the lines of that optgroup and just closing the thing and triggering click on each of the cached items in your list
[16:31:00] <Velveeta> enquora: then yeah, you could next/prevAll to get your list, then .each through them until you find the row that breaks the continuity, pushing each one onto another collection as you iterate over them, and when the loop is broken, take the secondary collection you've built, and apply your fill to it
[16:31:37] <jphase> Velveeta: so basically the same thing I'm doing but try closing it first?
[16:31:38] <Velveeta> nhulea: if the user entered dates that padded with 0's that might break that
[16:31:53] <enquora> thks. I've just concluded that's the most readable way
[16:32:20] <Velveeta> jphase: sort of, yeah, but prebuild your list with the items in the optgroup first, then close it and trigger click on each item in your built list
[16:32:31] <jphase> k
[16:32:37] <nhulea> Velveeta: like what do you mean 0000000000000004/00007/14
[16:32:54] <Velveeta> nhulea: well like, if they had 1/10/14 in one, and 01/10/14 in the other
[16:32:59] <Velveeta> but yeah, basically
[16:33:06] <nhulea> oh yeah
[16:33:08] <nhulea> ok
[16:33:13] <nhulea> cause then its not the same
[16:33:22] <Velveeta> probably what you'd be better off doing would be taking those entered dates, and creating new Date() objects out of them, and comparing those
[16:33:35] <nhulea> ok cool
[16:33:41] <Velveeta> if you use something like momentjs, it makes date construction a snap, in any format you want
[16:37:30] <Velveeta> jphase: yeah doesn't look like that works, huh :D let me dig for another minute or 2
[16:38:08] <jphase> was literally typing that same thing
[16:38:09] <jphase> hehe
[16:39:17] <jphase> I mean, you'd think a simple click trigger would work... when you inspect there's nothing but li's in their lil' rendered markup so I can't imagine what other events they're binding to allow the user to click each item :\
[16:39:18] <inputLoad> resolved !!
[16:41:41] <Velveeta> jphase: yeah, i was scraping its src to try to figure out any magic, but they're just using a .bind('click.chosen')
[16:42:08] <Velveeta> although, they're binding it to '_this.search_choices', so i'm not exactly sure what that list is
[16:43:23] <Velveeta> looks like it might be using a mousedown event vs click, actually
[16:43:40] <jphase> oic
[16:44:06] <Velveeta> mouseup!
[16:44:08] <Velveeta> found it
[16:44:13] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/QDv7h/1/

[17:14:21] <duch_workBeer> checkit .val() is for inputs.  what are you trying to get the value of?
[17:14:30] <rofel> its pretty terribly written but it works in jsfiddle but not in rails http://jsfiddle.net/LU5jB/1/
[17:14:33] <duch_workBeer> rofel that... doesn't make sense.  jquery is in the browser.  rails is server side.
[17:15:15] <rofel> duch_workBeer: when this jquery is in the rails asset pipeline it compiles but doesnt work
[17:15:24] <paul_uk> hi all.  has anyone had the issue of using jquery datepicker and the picker div is empty?  <div id="ui-datepicker-div" class="ui-datepicker ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-helper-clearfix ui-corner-all"></div>   Thats all I get, but I know there should be content in there.  What am I missing?
[17:15:26] <checkit> duch_workBeer: dave_s: I do understand that bit but i'm pulling the example almost verbatim from here (http://dbushell.github.io/Nestable/)... I need it to store/searlize the changes so I can post them server side to be saved...
[17:15:31] <duch_workBeer> rofel ah.
[17:16:18] <rofel> its got me stumped, because i was running it for some reason outside of the asset pipeline and it worked, but when i removed the include tag for the specific file, it compiles but doesnt work
[17:16:35] <duch_workBeer> any errors in the console?
[17:16:51] <rofel> no
[17:18:47] <dave_s> paul_uk: did you init the datepicker?
[17:18:52] <rofel> is there anything you can see wrong with it?
[17:18:58] <paul_uk> dave_s: yeah i have.
[17:19:19] <paul_uk> dave_s: if i dont init the datepicker, then i dont get the div.  so i know its firing.  but the div is empty.  im at a loss to explain why.
[17:19:29] <dave_s> paul_k: does your console say anything?
[17:19:35] <paul_uk> dave_s: nothing.
[17:19:49] <dave_s> Good. It's not supposed to be able to talk.
[17:20:04] <paul_uk> dave_s: http://pastie.org/private/sgiinxt5t00yfgr3nkbhg   thats what im doing and hi2 gets fired.
[17:20:19] <paul_uk> so i know datepicker is being loaded and executed.
[17:21:27] <dave_s> paul_k: jsfiddle please. Include your HTML.
[17:21:41] <dave_s> Take it to bare-bones, and work backwards.
[17:21:55] <paul_uk> dave_s: sure let me try that
[17:22:14] <dave_s> Also, try removing nextText/prevText.
[17:22:28] <dave_s> You're putting HTML in there, not sure if it's accepting it or not,.
[17:22:47] <dave_s> I don't use the datepicker in BS or jQ.
[17:22:58] <dave_s> anyTime.js is a lot sexier.
[17:23:14] <dave_s> (with jQ plugins too)
[17:23:19] <paul_uk> dave_s: i have even tried $('#date').datepicker();  just the bare bones
[17:23:45] <rofel> anyone know why functional jquery wouldnt work in rails asset pipeline?
[17:25:00] <duch_workBeer> rofel are $ and jQuery undefined?
[17:25:03] <duch_workBeer> or just one or the other?
[17:25:29] <rofel> i dont know, would that make an error?
[17:25:38] <dave_s> paul_k: http://jsfiddle.net/Fa8Xx/1660/
[17:26:12] <duch_workBeer> strange things can happen.  if they're both undefined, you've got something way odd going on and jquery doesn't exist at all.  if jQuery exists but $ doesn't, you've got noconflict magic happening
[17:26:17] <rofel> duch_workBeer: this works http://pste.co/p/nP2ptQawjmdb
[17:26:28] <duch_workBeer> interesting.
[17:26:29] <rofel> but the code from that jsfiddle doesnt
[17:26:40] <dave_s> rofel: What?
[17:26:46] <paul_uk> dave_s: nice many thanks for that.  i'll see why my version isn't working.  i am working off a template from bootstrap so maybe something there is interfering with it.
[17:26:56] <rofel> whats up dave_s?
[17:27:25] <dave_s> rofel: I mixed you up with paul_uk
[17:27:27] <rofel> duch_workBeer, so it must be something about the code i sent
[17:27:48] <duch_workBeer> rofel no clue.
[17:27:53] <dave_s> paul_k: Do you have jqueryUI included?
[17:27:57] <rofel> i just dont understand this
[17:27:58] <dave_s> *paul_u
[17:27:59] <paul_uk> dave_s: yeah i do
[17:28:03] <dave_s> Bah.
[17:28:30] <paul_uk> this is exactly what i said.  i've tried a basic example and it doesnt work.  so i said bah lol.
[17:28:38] <dave_s> paul_uk: Well, create the JS fiddle, it might be something silly.
[17:28:48] <dave_s> paul_uk: You're using Bootstrap?
[17:28:58] <paul_uk> dave_s: yeah i am using bootstrap 3
[17:29:07] <dave_s> paul_uk: Did you include the jQueryUI theme?
[17:29:16] <dave_s> (it will break bootstrap probably.)
[17:29:18] <paul_uk> dave_s: yeah the jqueryui theme is there
[17:29:32] <dave_s> Really? Huh.
[17:29:44] * dave_s thinks the jquery UI theme is gawdy
[17:29:54] <paul_uk> dave_s: its a template im using.  so within the application.css there is the css for the template and parts of jqueryUI in there
[17:30:23] <dave_s> paul_uk: Well still, it would help if we could see a jsFiddle.
[17:32:34] <paul_uk> dave_s: i see there is no UI option for jquery 2.1.0.  I'm using 2.1.0.  is that why UI isn't working?  Should I downgrade to 2.0.2 ?
[17:33:23] <dave_s> paul_k: Not sure.
[17:33:33] <dave_s> They may not have updated it yet or something.
[17:34:23] <paul_uk> dave_s: i downloaded 1.10.4 UI and they only put in 1.10.2 of jquery.  interesting.  i will downgrade and see if that helps.
[17:35:50] <dave_s> http://jsfiddle.net/6d4PM/
[17:35:52] <duch_workBeer> insanity wolf'ing it: we're releasing right now.
[17:36:16] <paul_k> jigga wat?
[17:36:25] <paul_k> oh, mis-mentions. :D
[17:36:29] <paul_uk> haha yeah
[17:36:36] <paul_uk> dave_s: thanks.  i will mirror that config
[17:37:51] <dave_s> paul_k: I made some changes to your jQuery to fit my personal tastes, (seeing $this puts me into a PHP mindset, not conducive of writing JS, lol) but otherwise it's what you had.
[17:38:06] <dave_s> paul_k: also the .data() method is neat little diddy.
[17:39:13] <dave_s> Also, jQueryUI 1.10.4 seems to be compatible with jQuery 1.6+
[17:39:27] <dave_s> So you ought to be good with jQ 2.x
[17:40:42] <dave_s> Don't suppose anyone knows why my jQuery Drag/Drop stuff is mis-behaving?http://jsfiddle.net/9rmDn/
[17:40:52] <dave_s> http://jsfiddle.net/9rmDn/ << clicky
[17:41:54] <paul_uk> dave_s: well this is nuts.  no matter what i do its not showing up.  i think either im missing something or something is overriding default behaviour.  im gonna take a break and get back to it later.  many thanks for the fiddles.
[17:42:10] <dave_s> Beginning to feel like I'd get this done faster with modals and straight-up jQ than trying to make jQUI work.
[17:49:43] <dave_s> Yay! 9pm.
[17:49:49] <dave_s> I need a raise. :(
[17:50:09] <dave_s> See you guys later when I'm at dennys.
[18:00:14] <tucan> $('body').addClass('ads-small');   is there anything wrong with this line?
[18:00:50] <tucan> in my <style> block  i have  body.ads-small { background: red; }
[18:01:00] <tucan> and it doesnt turn red
[18:10:20] <gblair> @tucan i tend to use underscores rather than hyphens in css classes, not sure if that actually affects anything
[18:13:56] <tucan> no
[18:18:45] <gblair> @tucan do you happen to have body { background: not-red !important; } anywhere?
[18:19:19] <gblair> in chrome inspect element and see if the class is actually being applied and if there is another style overriding it
[18:20:17] <tucan> well i did test on body
[18:20:30] <tucan> it seems like my jquery isnt adding the class
[18:21:13] <gblair> try jQuery('body').addClass('ads-small') in the console
[18:21:32] <tucan> does it matter that I have the jquery after the style block
[18:21:39] <gblair> shouldn't matter
[18:23:23] <gblair> is your javascript wrapped in a $(document).ready(){    } or something?
[18:23:35] <gblair> * something similar?
[18:23:39] <tucan> it says [object Object]
[18:23:58] <tucan> no
[18:24:18] <tucan> why, is it required?
[18:24:43] <gblair> if you put it in a document ready block, it will run after the DOM has loaded.
[18:25:15] <tucan> is it required though?
[18:25:49] <gblair> depends, if your javascript is running before the dom is ready, there will be no <body> to add a class to
[18:25:52] <gblair> try this: https://gist.github.com/gavinblair/9699756
[18:25:55] <tw2113> it'll help make sure it runs at a more appropriate point
[18:28:23] <tucan> doesnt seem to fix it
[18:31:04] <gblair> What do you mean by "it says [object Object]' what made it say that? Also, if you run $('body').addClass('ads-small'); in the console, does it work?
[18:32:44] <tw2113> are you checking the body tag with your inspector tools? making sure it gets added?
[18:35:13] <tucan> when i enter $('body').addClass('ads-small');   it gives me [object Object]  in the console
[18:35:19] <tucan> no idea what it means
[18:35:34] <tw2113> click it
[18:36:54] <tucan> in HTMLBodyElement, it says it has the class ads-small
[18:37:14] <gblair> what is your css block?
[18:37:58] <tucan> body.ads-small .container { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
[18:39:05] <gblair> do you still have the body.ads-small { background: red; } too? And is there any content in the body / container?
[18:41:28] <tucan> yes there is content
[18:41:43] <tucan> no i dont have those styles
[18:43:48] <gblair> can you pastebin/jsfiddle/gist the code?
[18:46:49] <tucan> i feel like the problem might not the jquery
[18:48:32] <tucan> what im trying to do is basically sniff browser size and serve an appropriate ad size, (as layout is responsive) ... I got this part working except the padding from Bootstrap
[18:48:44] <tucan> is pushing it to the right
[18:49:30] <gblair> it definitely sounds like a css issue
[18:49:38] <tucan> so I am addClass to body
[18:49:52] <tucan> ad-small when we're on small screen
[18:50:11] <tucan> except the ad doesn't show at all
[18:50:23] <tucan> something is conflicting
[18:50:59] <tucan> it only shows an ad when i remove  that line with  addClass
[18:52:06] <joobie> guys, i have something like <div class="category1"><input/><input/></div> .. i'm trying to target all the input's within that div and using $('div.category1').siblings('input').click(function() { } but it's not working
[18:52:09] <joobie> any idea?
[18:53:58] <gblair> siblings is for things that are on the same level (like, brothers and sisters) - i think you want .children?
[18:55:13] <gblair> you can do $('.category1 input').click(function(){ });
[18:57:09] <joobie> thanks gblair
[19:01:08] <zumba_addict> hey folks, what i found out in Facebook is cool. They disabled access to Chrome Dev tools. How is that done?
[19:01:34] <zumba_addict> I mean, we can open chrome dev tools but i can't pull anything in console
[19:01:47] <zumba_addict> it will even say an error if I type console.log('some text')
[19:01:51] <gblair> @tucan -- you might have to put a row class on the container element. Bootstrap expects you to nest classes in a specific way.
[19:03:45] <joobie> gblair
[19:03:46] <joobie> if ($(this).val().isNumeric()) {
[19:03:48] <joobie> what about this bro
[19:03:53] <joobie> it's just erroring
[19:09:28] <gblair> if($.isNumeric($(this).val())){
[19:09:32] <gblair> maybe?
[19:09:43] <gblair> @zumba_addict that makes me sad
[19:11:06] <zumba_addict> gblair: it only applies to newer versions of Chrome
[19:16:31] <cprodigy29> I'm have $( window ).resize(function() to reside a video to a div. The problem is on page load the video doesn't show until I resize the page
[19:17:01] <gblair> $(window).resize(function(){ ... }).resize();
[19:18:42] <cprodigy29> yep I forgot that last .resize()
[19:18:49] <cprodigy29> thanks gblair
[19:18:51] <gblair> XD
[19:38:06] <Cache_Money> Is there a way to undo a data-toggle="modal" using jQuery?
[19:39:42] <gblair> $('#button').attr('data-toggle', '');
[19:39:49] <gblair> should work
[19:42:48] <Cache_Money> gblair: should #button be the id of the modal?
[19:45:01] <Cache_Money> gbair: I tried both the id of the original link and the modal but that didn't do the trick
[19:48:28] <gblair> i just ran $('.btn').attr('data-toggle', ''); on http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/ and it made the buttons stop modalling
[19:55:03] <Cache_Money> After a user clicks a link the modal is presented.  Within that modal there is a button, once it's clicked I'd like the modal to disappear and the background to go back to normal.  Are we talking about the same thing?
[19:57:14] <gblair> ah ic, <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">×</button>
[20:18:02] <Cache_Money> gblair: sorry, I got signed off
[20:18:40] <gblair> i think you just need data-dismiss="modal" on a button within the modal
[20:20:48] <jason___> hello
