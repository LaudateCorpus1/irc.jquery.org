[00:00:31] <gf3> paul_irish: I dig the tabs mixed in with spaces :)
[00:00:45] <paul_irish> is your browser telling you this?
[00:00:51] <paul_irish> do you read URLs with vim now?
[00:00:57] <paul_irish> shit bro
[00:01:44] <ngharo> don't give him any ideas
[00:01:46] <gf3> Basically
[00:02:19] <paul_irish> hey ngharo.
[00:02:25] <paul_irish> been a while
[00:02:30] <tw2113> which part of Cali are you in paul_irish ?
[00:02:33] <paul_irish> SF
[00:02:39] <ngharo> hi paul_irish
[00:02:42] <ngharo> yes indeedy
[00:02:47] <tw2113> i'm here in town right now
[00:03:01] <wodemaye__> If I call a supporting resource on a page, it will obviously show said page's URI in the referrer header of the HTTP request for that resource.  What if I call the resource via NYUD.NET (coralcdn)?  Can you use rel="noreferrer" for <script>s, <img>s, and <iframe>s, etc?  Any other workarounds to spoof the referrer of a supporting resource requests?
[00:03:13] <tw2113> i head back to South Dakota on monday morning
[00:03:37] <paul_irish> tw2113: whoa why
[00:04:00] <tw2113> hanging out with some Mozilla people + employees, doing another MDN doc sprint
[00:04:11] <paul_irish> no way!! awesome :)
[00:04:18] <tw2113> just happens to be an in person one, on their tab
[00:04:41] <wodemaye__> tw2113, that's so cool.
[00:04:43] <paul_irish> supercool
[00:04:49] <tw2113> :D thanks
[00:04:50] <paul_irish> janet and sheppy in town?
[00:04:56] <tw2113> yup, both of them
[00:05:03] <paul_irish> score
[00:05:07] <paul_irish> they're great
[00:05:10] <wodemaye__> does anyone have access to a webserver where they can see the raw httpd logs that i can use to test my theory above?
[00:05:16] <tw2113> should I say hi for you?
[00:06:46] <ngharo> wodemaye__: pm me, i'll check it out
[00:06:57] <tw2113> if you get bored, you should visit tomorrow at the Moz offices, we'll be there
[00:07:35] <paul_irish> hmm potentiallly
[00:08:03] <paul_irish> moz sf or moz mtv?
[00:08:11] <tw2113> SF
[00:08:15] <paul_irish> tight
[00:08:21] <tw2113> mtv was friday
[00:08:38] <paul_irish> proud of you, dude. :)
[00:09:00] <paul_irish> s'awesome.
[00:09:08] <tw2113> i would have done the "i'm king of the world" thing earlier on the ferry to Sausalito, but too many people present
[00:09:08] <paul_irish> ill try to come by
[00:09:12] <paul_irish> hhaha
[00:10:35] <tw2113> Sheppy, Janet, and Jean-Yves are here for it, only ones i figure you'd probably know already
[00:13:09] <paul_irish> david?
[00:13:22] <tw2113> don't believe so
[00:13:28] <paul_irish> k
[00:13:57] <tw2113> i love that i can see the Oakland Bay Bridge from my hotel room
[00:14:39] <tw2113> ya know, i just realized we're talking in #jquery and not #html5
[00:16:48] <paul_irish> true
[00:16:58] <paul_irish> first time for everything.
[00:17:34] <tw2113> once i'm done with The Daily Show, I'm going to bed
[00:21:14] <wodemaye__> ok, so coral and rel=nr both don't work.  any ideas for spoofing referrer of calls to static supporting-resources?
[00:22:51] <Time2303> That sad moment when you realise that the problem with your code that you have been looking for was simply using ; instead of ,
[00:23:04] <paul_irish> Time2303:
[00:23:08] <Time2303> :<
[00:23:10] <paul_irish> what editor do you use
[00:23:32] <Time2303> Aptana Studio 3
[00:23:57] <paul_irish> there must be a way to integrate jslint or jshint into it
[00:24:01] <paul_irish> find it
[00:24:04] <paul_irish> and do it.
[00:24:06] <paul_irish> right now
[00:24:22] <paul_irish> ideally, you want jshint checking your code as you type it
[00:24:26] <Time2303> alright
[00:24:38] <Time2303> thanks
[00:24:56] <paul_irish> <3
[00:25:10] <tw2113> paul_irish our itinerary says 9:30a - 5p tomorrow, so a decent window available.
[00:25:15] <paul_irish> kk
[00:25:22] <tw2113> with that said, i need to zzz
[00:25:29] <paul_irish> pz
[00:29:09] <Time2303> paul_irish, it comes by default with Aptana -- just had to enable it in Preferences. Thanks
[00:29:45] <paul_irish> :)
[00:30:27] <gf3> Imagine a world without semi-colons..
[00:30:32] * gf3 glares at self
[00:31:54] <systemfault> What a wonderful world it would be… ;)
[00:33:39] <Time2303> but then, how would we use winky faces :(
[00:36:18] <gf3> ¡-)
[00:36:55] <paul_irish> hah
[01:09:51] <Monkeypaws> how do i just blank out a div?  this isnt workin - document.getElementsByName("#controls2").style.display = 'none';
[01:11:05] <Dr-Bombay> make up your mind whether you are using jquery or not
[01:11:16] <Monkeypaws> oh im using everything.
[01:11:19] <Monkeypaws> :D
[01:11:31] <Monkeypaws> def. using jquery
[01:11:34] <Dr-Bombay> people who maintain your code will curse you
[01:11:44] <Monkeypaws> thankfully thats just me, this is for my robot
[01:12:24] <Monkeypaws> oh if you saw my code... haha
[01:12:29] <Monkeypaws> such a hack job.
[01:12:33] <Monkeypaws> but its workin
[01:12:36] <Dr-Bombay> is controls2 an id or a name
[01:12:39] <Monkeypaws> its a div name
[01:12:47] <Monkeypaws> on the main page :l
[01:13:12] <Dr-Bombay> is the name controls2 or #controls2?
[01:13:40] <Monkeypaws> oh the id is controls2
[01:13:49] <Dr-Bombay> you said it was a name not an id
[01:13:54] <Monkeypaws> my mistake :x
[01:14:06] <Dr-Bombay> $('#controls2').css('display', 'none')
[01:14:41] <Monkeypaws> \o/
[01:17:38] <Monkeypaws> Dr-Bombay perfect ty
[01:17:45] * Monkeypaws is done!
[01:17:51] <Monkeypaws> except for code cleanup.
[01:18:11] <Monkeypaws> is there a way to gray out a div rather than set its display to none?
[01:21:40] <Dr-Bombay> overlay it with a translucent rectangle. I don't have room here to explain how to do that
[01:28:23] <Monkeypaws> thanks dr, i found a demo of what you said
[01:28:32] <Monkeypaws> http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/02/15/overlay-like-effect/
[01:29:31] <Monkeypaws> im gonna ask another dumb question, sorry.  I need to display users in a queue within a small div, right now using tables, when it fills over it just spills outside of the div area... is there a way to display these tables with scrollbars or something?
[01:31:24] <Monkeypaws> oh looks like i could use javascript datatables
[01:31:38] <Monkeypaws> sounds hard.
[01:32:27] <Monkeypaws> oh thats a jquere plugin
[01:32:29] <Monkeypaws> yeesh
[01:33:43] <Guest99988> Hi Peeps! Any idea how I can attached images attribute to its parent elements
[01:34:08] <Guest99988> Basically I want images attributes to attach as a class
[01:34:40] <Monkeypaws> sorry guest im a nub
[01:34:42] <Guest99988> /Add the image attribute as class for individual styling
[01:34:42] <Guest99988>        $('.group_our_people .field-item').each(function() {
[01:34:43] <Guest99988>          var att = $('.group_our_people .field-item img').attr('alt');
[01:34:43] <Guest99988> 	  $(this).addClass(att);
[01:34:43] <Guest99988>        });
[01:34:55] <Monkeypaws> ooh use gist.github.com
[01:34:58] <Guest99988> that code is not working
[01:35:26] <Guest99988> anyone can shed me some light? thanks
[01:35:55] <Monkeypaws> hey guest, while you're here.. what should i use to display  a list of users in a table? it needs to be scrollable
[01:36:52] <Guest99988> through Jquery or PHP/MySQL
[01:36:59] <Guest99988> ?
[01:37:10] <Monkeypaws> uhh from php
[01:37:12] <Monkeypaws> srry
[01:37:16] <Monkeypaws> php/mysql yup
[01:40:21] <Monkeypaws> wanna see? :D
[01:40:49] <Guest99988> a moment
[01:40:54] <Guest99988> constructing the code
[01:41:00] <Monkeypaws> oh
[01:41:17] <Guest99988> but basically you just need to pull the data using mysql "SELECT"
[01:41:29] <Monkeypaws> i have the data allready, right now im showing it in a table
[01:41:35] <Guest99988> like "SELECT userName from userTable ORDER BY desc";
[01:41:40] <Monkeypaws> k
[01:42:49] <Guest99988> http://php.about.com/od/phpwithmysql/ss/mysql_php_2.htm
[01:42:56] <Guest99988> something like that
[01:43:29] <Monkeypaws> i got that all figured out, just trying to display the data in a nice way
[01:43:32] <Monkeypaws> nicer than a table
[01:43:40] <Monkeypaws> something that scrolls
[01:43:46] <Monkeypaws> stuff like that
[01:44:55] <Guest99988> loop the data like this? while ($part = mysql_fetch_assoc($result))
[01:44:55] <Guest99988> {
[01:44:55] <Guest99988> $part_list .= "<tr><td>" . $part['item'] . "</td><td>". $part['descript'] ."</td><td>". $part['price'] ."</td><tr>";
[01:44:55] <Guest99988> }
[01:46:33] <Dr-Bombay> wht
[01:48:12] <Monkeypaws> Hey Dr
[02:01:37] <GoSox> Is it possible to have a bunch of HTML in a div, have that div be invisible, and then have jquery take copies of that div, and stick it in other places on the page? So it would be like a template, but it wouldn't require any new HTTP requests, the data would already be on the page.
[02:02:59] <Monkeypaws> GoSox - you can use css to hide the divs when you want the hidden
[02:03:21] <Time2303> GoSox, not sure how correct this is but.. use a div labelled something like hiddenDiv with css / display:none, then use jquery to copy the contents of that div into a new one
[02:04:06] <GoSox> Monkeypaws: i can't do it that way, there's no way to predict how many i'd need
[02:06:23] <GoSox> i hope that works because the more i think about it, i'm probably going to use that technique a ton on this particular page. And it will make it so much faster, to not have to load more data from the server, when it's all there on the original page waiting for use
[02:24:36] <Tasser> where do I download plugins such as http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable ?
[02:26:35] <Dr-Bombay> tasser: concentrate on the top section of that page and the answer will come to you
[02:28:49] <Tasser> nah, don't see it
[02:30:42] <Dr-Bombay> Draggable is a built in feature of jQuery UI
[02:31:12] <Tasser> argh
[02:37:33] <Whirl3d> GoSox, did you get it worked out?
[02:37:58] <jes> I'm using datepicker plugin with validation plugin. If I enter a correct date in a field by hand the "Incorrect date" message disspaears, but when I select it from datepicker it stays on (it does validate when I submit). Anyway around this?
[02:38:03] <GoSox> no my question was purely hypothetical, the pages I was asking about, I won't be making for weeks most likely
[02:38:14] <GoSox> the idea just occurred to me while i was working on other stuff
[02:38:59] <Whirl3d> GoSox, you can do even better than that. You could have the html loaded into an object (not attached to the dom) and append it over and over whereever you want
[02:39:53] <GoSox> honestly that doesn't sound better though :D cause doesn't that mean two HTTP requests instead of one, if i go my original route of just sticking it in the document and hiding it
[02:39:54] <GoSox> ?
[02:40:04] <Whirl3d> nope
[02:40:05] <Whirl3d> just one
[02:40:16] <GoSox> how would i load it into an object then?
[02:40:22] <Whirl3d> .load
[02:40:26] <Whirl3d> or .get
[02:40:28] <Whirl3d> or .ajax
[02:40:43] <GoSox> ok so thats an extra http request
[02:40:56] <Whirl3d> It doesn't refresh the page
[02:41:06] <GoSox> but its still an http request
[02:41:23] <GoSox> my way, the data is already there, so it can load instant even on slow or laggy network connections
[02:41:42] <Whirl3d> Regardless, if you wan tto put it in a div that has display:none, then you could on page load, remove the div from the domand keep in it memory.
[02:42:04] <Whirl3d> It'll be much faster to cache the info than to keep relaoding it from a hidden div
[02:42:58] <GoSox> i have so much work to do :/
[02:42:58] <Whirl3d> $.detach allows you to detatch it from the dom and $.append and $.clone would allow you to make clones and append them whererever you needed
[02:43:06] <GoSox> nice
[02:43:10] <GoSox> yeah thats what ill do
[02:43:29] <GoSox> this is a data entry system, so the fewer http requests the better
[02:46:58] <sasori> hi..does anyone know where to get a jquery 1.7.x manual in .chm format?
[02:51:32] <Dev78> sasori, why don't you use your puppets?

[02:52:53] <Dev78> does this help: https://bitbucket.org/greydwarf/jquerydoc/downloads/jquery_ref.html ?
[02:53:02] <Dev78> I thought Sasori was from naruto, sorry lol
[02:54:10] <sasori> Dev78: i wish it was a downloadable .chm format already :| , actually i have one,but it's a 1.4 version, i want the 1.7.x thing
[02:55:09] <sasori> and yea..sasori is from naruto..but am not sure what's the connection of the puppets with my question about the manual that am looking for :|
[02:56:50] <Dev78> sorry was just a joke lol
[02:57:07] <Dev78> and can't really see a .chm version on google, maybe others can help
[02:57:08] <Dev78> lol
[02:57:53] <sasori> i googled earlier, but it's in chinese lol, teh google chrome can translate the page, but there's a pop up thing that can't be translated XD
[02:58:43] <sht1144> hi everyone ! how to disable a tab using jquery tools ?
[03:01:49] <soraryu> what can I do to make $(document).scrollLeft() animatable?
[03:14:41] <soraryu> $('body').scrollLeft() works in Chrome, $('html').scrollLeft() in FF - whats the way to support both?
[03:45:45] <vladyn> hola
[03:46:27] <vladyn> what is easiest way to get #anchor from href and to output onlu 'anchor' ?
[03:46:54] <vladyn> is there a function or I have to do split() or something
[03:47:03] <vladyn> split string
[03:55:53] <widoz> hi, i'm a newbie to jquery, i've a problem with animation in this site http://whatssicily.com/ after animated the lighter and showed a page, on return if i move cursor sometimes the lighter don't place correctly. (sorry for my english)
[03:57:05] <vladyn> found js replace()
[03:58:47] <walidvb> hi guys, this is probably not the right place, but i'm developing a prototype of a mobile app, and doing it in html/jquery
[03:59:28] <walidvb> does someone know how I can set up a layout that will display the same on smartphone and browser, so that i can dev it?
[04:04:55] <gloomer> walidvb there are many libraries to chose from
[04:05:01] <gloomer> very few fully developed
[04:05:29] <walidvb> gloomer: i know, i just need to do something as fast as possible, school project, what's behind really doesn't matter..
[04:05:40] <gloomer> kendo ui
[04:05:42] <gloomer> jquery mobile
[04:05:46] <gloomer> html5 boilerplate
[04:05:49] <walidvb> my only issue right now is having the same scales on my phone and my browser
[04:05:58] <gloomer> well usually its not handled like that
[04:06:11] <gloomer> you will just gracefully size things as the resolution shrinks
[04:07:33] <walidvb> hm so i need to do a proto on my browser, and then change what doesn't work on the phone, kind of..
[04:07:57] <walidvb> i tried doing smth like setting <body> size to the reso of an iphone, and user-scale to 1
[04:08:04] <walidvb> not quite doing it unfortunately
[04:21:14] <Whirl3d> in order to animate css properties do you have to load jqueryUI?
[04:21:25] <Whirl3d> *classes, not properties. Sorry
[04:24:22] <Defrothew> Good day! Can I have a question? Is it possible to enable ajax without including .php files on the param url? I was planning to have a like and unlike button in my website without having the page to load again.
[04:26:15] <Whirl3d> Defrothew, yes it's pretty easy. If you google jquery like button, there are lot of tutorials and plugins to do it for you.
[04:28:53] <Defrothew> @Whirl3d Additional information, its my own like and dislike feature and not Facebook like. :D
[04:29:36] <Whirl3d> Defrothew, you'd use the same process just a different server...namely your own
[04:29:38] <Defrothew> @Whirl3d Thanks, I think I got the tutorial now. :D - Thanks for your help. :D
[04:30:38] <Whirl3d> np. If there's something in the tut that you don't get, check back here and I'm sure someone can help.
[04:31:40] <Defrothew> Ok, thanks. :D
[04:54:07] <GoSox> check out the star box on this page: http://new.menulizard.com/menus/287-derry-express/
[04:54:16] <GoSox> took me forever to get it working right but its pretty sweet now
[04:56:37] <GoSox> crap sorry, wrong channel
[04:56:42] <GoSox> that had NOTHING to do with jquery at all

[05:17:35] <shoky> around it
[05:18:58] <shoky> and don't paste such crap here without making it readable first. the whole thing, not just the line of code that you assume is the problem
[05:19:17] <Amel> ^
[05:24:14] <astropirate> ohh god thats hideous
[05:24:22] <astropirate> you should use notepad to format it a bit better
[05:32:55] <Amel> Hopsy: http://jsbeautifier.org/
[05:36:32] <Hopsy> hmm Amel that doesnt help too much
[05:37:08] <Hopsy> Amel: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1605463
[05:38:12] <Amel> I don't know what you did to break it, but the website I link should only make your code look nicer and easier to use
[05:38:15] <Amel> It does not fix any bugs
[05:39:52] <Hopsy> Amel: I paste the source code of http://www.net-force.nl/challenge/level108/index.html but it doesnt help
[05:43:01] <Amel> You should only paste the javascript, Hopsy
[05:43:13] <Amel> Also, that is a test for computer hackers, right?
[05:45:57] <Hopsy> Amel: yes
[05:46:21] <Hopsy> Amel: there are 4 files he is including
[05:46:48] <Hopsy> I mean 1 sorry

[05:47:39] <Amel> I refuse to help with the challenge
[05:47:53] <Hopsy> whhyy -_-'
[05:47:56] <Amel> Maybe you should focus on learning javascript first, try reading a tutorial
[05:50:12] <Industrial> I'm not sure I understand what $().scrollTop(); is for. I have a header with height 100px and under that a menu (#menu). $('#menu').scrollTop() keeps returning 0 no matter how far the page I'm scrolled.
[05:50:33] <Industrial> in Chrome on Ubuntu
[05:50:53] <nlogax> Industrial: i assume the #menu element is itself not scrolling?
[05:51:04] <Industrial> no
[05:51:26] <nlogax> scrollTop() returns the vertical scroll position in that element
[05:52:05] <Industrial> Basically if the scrolltop is higher then the height of the header, I'll apply css style fixed to the menu.
[05:52:20] <Industrial> so that it sticks to the page but ends up under the header
[05:53:36] <Industrial> nlogax: what if I check the scrolltop of the body dom element? or the document?
[05:53:46] <Industrial> can I get the amount of pixels scrolled form the top/
[05:53:50] <nlogax> Industrial: yeah, that sounds more like what you want :)
[06:28:45] <`poo> sup.
[06:31:39] <Amel> hi `poo
[06:33:20] <darokel> Hi all, wondering if anyone can help me? Is there a good way to check if an existing element has a particular class on page refresh?
[06:33:32] <`poo> yes
[06:33:49] <`poo> hi Amel
[06:33:49] <spdaly> Hello all!
[06:34:01] <nlogax> helloo
[06:34:05] <`poo> hi shoky
[06:34:35] <Amel> darokel: on page refresh? You mean every time the page loads?
[06:34:42] <Amel> There is no specific code for that
[06:34:48] <spdaly> I need some help with the .find() function… How can I find elements with this class OR another class?
[06:35:14] <spdaly> @darokel. I wouldn't worry about page refresh. Can't you just check it on every load?
[06:35:25] <Amel> if ($('element[class="somevalue"]')) // this should do it
[06:35:49] <darokel> @amel For example, a plugin I'm using generates some divs dynamically, I set two classes on each of those divs, but when I refresh or click a link within those dynamic divs, they lose their existing classes which I set on them
[06:36:07] <darokel> @spda
[06:36:19] <darokel> @spdaly yes sorry, that's what I meant
[06:41:07] <elegos> hello! Is there a jQuery method or plugin in order to divide an HTML content on N height-equal columns? I.e. I've got 400 lines, I want the method to divide them in 4 columns of 100 rows
[06:41:40] <sht1144> Hi everyone ! Is there any way of disabling a tab using jquery tools ?
[06:43:18] <Hopsy> Amel and shoky :) thank youu

[06:50:17] <elegos> sht1144: what's a "tab" in HTML?
[06:51:10] <`poo> he wasn't asking about HTML, but jquery tools
[06:51:13] <graingert> I want to start a sentence with the word jQuery how should I capitalize it?
[06:51:24] <`poo> and stackoverflow has an answer for him if he cares to google
[06:51:36] <elegos> about my question?
[06:51:47] <sht1144> i am trying to create a sort of tabbed interface wizard ...   http://jquerytools.org/demos/tabs/index.htm
[06:51:48] <`poo> his
[06:51:52] <sht1144> something like this
[06:52:06] <`poo> sht1144:  what about http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6406275/jquery-tools-tabs-how-to-disable-a-tab
[06:52:23] <sht1144> they have an example of a wizard , but it doesnt show how to disable a tab
[06:52:35] <deiu> Hello
[06:53:38] <deiu> I'm trying to post data to a form using ajax. I would like to know if it's possible to get the response code from the operation, as I am looking for either HTTP 200 or 201 codes.
[06:53:53] <Amel> Yes of course
[06:53:57] <Amel> It's in the documentation
[06:54:32] <sehh> guys, is it possible to load jquery UI and apply it to the page BEFORE showing it to the user? Right now, my users see broken un-modified elements for 1-2 seconds before jquery UI manages to load and modify them with the proper theme.
[06:54:46] <deiu> I'm trying to us getResponseHeader but it doesn't work.
[06:54:53] <Amel> http://api.jquery.com/
[06:55:34] <Amel> Look at post(), get() and ajax()
[06:55:46] <sht1144> `poo: i was trying it before , but it wasnt working ... il give it another try ..
[06:55:55] <deiu> I think statusCode is what I need. Thanks!
[06:56:31] <sht1144> If there is another solution , please do let me know
[06:57:03] <Whirl3d> flash cs6 outputs html5? Wow.
[06:57:50] <sehh> nobody knows?
[06:58:04] <rworth> sehh this is called a FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
[06:58:11] <Amel> Just put it into the head element, sehh?
[06:58:33] <rworth> not specific to jQuery UI but general to JavaScript styling elements after page load
[06:59:15] <Whirl3d> seh, if you have to, set the body element to opacity:0, load your content, then set the body opacity to 1
[06:59:19] <elegos> sehh: you can hide them by default, make your changes and element.show them (or toggle display: none to block)
[06:59:35] <elegos> or use opacity, this prevents page formatting being messed
[06:59:42] <sehh> hmm
[06:59:47] <rworth> sehh there are various workarounds, one popularized by html5boilerplate is to have a class on the html element that javascript removes
[06:59:51] <sehh> well the script laods at the head element
[06:59:56] <rworth> and in css use that class to hide the elements
[06:59:57] <sehh> s/laods/loads
[07:00:19] <rworth> so then at the same instant they are made visible, they are already styled
[07:00:31] <sehh> but jquery UI elements seem to be styled by the UI after page load
[07:00:58] <rworth> so that's same point at which you'd remove the nojs class from the html element (hard-coded in the html)
[07:01:06] <rworth> and your css would be something like
[07:01:42] <rworth> .nojs .accordion { display: none }
[07:01:57] <`poo> visibility: false   seems a better choice to me
[07:02:00] <rworth> except that's far too simplistic because it means users without javascript will never see that content
[07:02:02] <`poo> er, visibility: hidden
[07:02:27] <rworth> depends on whether you want the layout of the element fully expanded during load
[07:02:47] <rworth> which in the case of an accordion you wouldn't. You want the page to grow, not shrink
[07:02:52] <spaceturtle> Hello, I am looking for a way to hide a select element in a form, and change its value based on a user clicking a div using jquery. This would be similar to some sort of "star rating" but using html instead of star images. Does anyone know of anything like this, or sould point me in the right direction?
[07:03:29] <Whirl3d> just do it yourself, spaceturtle, it's pretty easy to do
[07:05:17] <sehh> hmm
[07:05:23] <sehh> I think I see my mistake
[07:05:34] <sehh> I've got everything loading within $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[07:05:35] <Whirl3d> in your parent element for the clickable divs, you would use $(holder).on("click", ".clickable", function (e) { selectElement.val($(this).index()); return false;});
[07:05:55] <sehh> so that is why things load after the page has loaded and the user sees unstyled elements
[07:06:21] <Whirl3d> that would mean that any click on a ".clickable" class element (div/pic/whatever) would automatically lookup it's index and apply it to the select box you indeicated
[07:06:48] <sehh> unfortunately, if I take the styling code out of the ready(function()), then it stops working... something about variables out of scope is causing the problems
[07:07:11] <sehh> is there a way to run jquery code out of $(document).ready(function() and still work with code that is within that block?
[07:07:28] <Whirl3d> sehh, the reason you have to use document ready is that if you don't, you cant be sure that your elements even exist yet.
[07:08:54] <Whirl3d> so, again, your best bet is to set a CSS rule for your styled elements with opacity:0 then on document ready, apply your jQueryUI methods, _then_ remove that css class to reveal your styled elements.
[07:09:35] <sehh> so it is impossible to style the elements before the page loads?
[07:09:40] <sehh> that sounds wrong...
[07:09:48] <Whirl3d> the elements don't exist before the page loads
[07:09:54] <Whirl3d> that's what loading is
[07:09:59] <Whirl3d> its loading the elements
[07:10:06] <Whirl3d> you can't style something that isn't there
[07:10:17] <LukeNukem> sehh, nope
[07:10:25] <LukeNukem> put your js at the footer
[07:10:30] <LukeNukem> or on document ready
[07:11:03] <Whirl3d> now if you wanted to manually apply your css styles to your elements (rather than having jqueryUI do it for you), you could prestyle them
[07:11:53] <Whirl3d> but you would have to manually style all of your elments and depending on the complexity of your implementation of jqueryUI and your familiarity with css, it could be a real problem.
[07:12:32] <sehh> hah got it working, styled before page load!! woohoo
[07:12:52] <sehh> now the page appears with everything styled, no hidding needed
[07:26:51] <Whirl3d> so does anyone know how to create custom animation queues for a complex series of animations?
[07:37:59] <straws> does it pay off to learn java/
[07:38:00] <straws> ?
[07:38:51] <aca20031> certainly pays off to learn the difference between java javascript and jquery
[07:39:11] <Whirl3d> How long is a piece of string?
[07:39:29] <astropirate> so long, you wont believe it
[07:39:35] <straws> i learned to program in delphi so java seems really weird
[07:40:18] <Whirl3d> I mean, seriously, for a neuro-surgeon...maybe not so much. Or for someone with shutin syndrome, not at all. Learning Java only pays off for people who might use it one day.
[07:40:45] <Whirl3d> Are you going to be doing any java programming? If so, learn it.
[07:41:28] <Whirl3d> astropirate, I've heard that you can cut it twice and it'll still be too short, though.
[07:41:33] <straws> i don't know
[07:41:37] <straws> but i know i'll be fucking your mom tonight
[07:41:56] <Whirl3d> Glad somebody is. I mean at 85, she needs it
[07:42:19] <straws> and she'll get it
[07:42:23] <Whirl3d> And besides, short, fat effiminate men like yourself turn her on.
[07:42:34] <straws> i'm not american
[07:42:38] <astropirate> Whirl3d: From what I gather, the string is infinitely long... you keep cutting it in half and there will always be some string left :S
[07:42:38] <straws> =|
[07:43:39] <Whirl3d> very likely true, astropirate. hmmf
[07:43:55] <Whirl3d> You have won. Now we will answer all your questions for free.
[07:44:06] <astropirate> well hazaaa
[07:44:39] <astropirate> Any freelance front end developers looking for work? please PM me
[07:44:49] <astropirate> preferably US based
[07:45:08] <Whirl3d> what kind of front-end?
[07:45:35] <astropirate> UI developers - we use jquery
[07:47:58] <Whirl3d> from an efficient standpoint, would it be more efficient to store a function reference in the data object of an element or would it be better to use .bind() ?
[07:49:07] <astropirate> Whirl3d: use on()
[07:49:33] <Whirl3d> not for custom event binding
[07:49:44] <astropirate> ahh
[07:49:53] <Whirl3d> I need to encapsulate an animation sequence by it's pieces.
[07:50:30] <Whirl3d> So I have previously used .bind(enterStage:function, exitStage:function ) and then used trigger to get them to do their bit
[07:51:13] <Whirl3d> but recently I wondered if I stored those functions in the data object and then applied them like: $("this").data("enterStage').apply($(this));
[07:52:09] <astropirate> do a benchmark and let us all know :)
[07:52:20] <astropirate> but i think it will be much slower this way
[07:52:26] <astropirate> i dont know how to prove it though :)
[08:04:31] <wanderingi> http://pastebin.ca/2141985  i have the following code, but it keeps submitting all the time, i need to make it wait 10 seconds before each attempt.
[08:23:25] <`poo> Whirl3d: it depends.. calling the function directly like that is a synchronous blocking call.  using events its asynchronous non-blocking and lets your other UI stuff breath
[08:24:17] <`poo> so with events your animation might be less "real-time" but it wont choke other stuff as bad
[08:25:37] <`poo> though i'm sure you're aware of this
[08:26:54] <`poo> also why not use on() for custom events?
[08:29:09] <`poo> bind is just a call to on()
[08:31:00] * astropirate slaps Whirl3d
[08:32:25] <`poo> harder
[08:35:02] <hex`> I have variable 'form' which is $("form")... now I need to append more data to that selector, becoming like $("form#id")... is the only way of doing it is: form = $(form + "#id");?
[08:36:16] <`poo> what?
[08:36:56] <`poo> a selector is a string, you can manipulate it as such
[08:40:20] <hex`> `poo: but form variable is already $("form")... If I do 'form = $(form + "#id") it will become $($("form")#id)
[08:40:48] <oodletech> In jquery, is there a live event handler for say is visible or extension was called?
[08:40:50] <`poo> then don't do that
[08:40:52] <pachet> hex`: let me stop you right there
[08:40:55] <sovok> hex`: get the defining attributes of your element and put them in the selector, instead of the element itself. e.g. $(form[0].nodeName + "#id");
[08:41:09] <pachet> let's put aside '#' for a moment, and work with a class
[08:41:24] <pachet> so you have a form element, that you grab with your first selector : var $form = $('form')
[08:41:34] <xec> hex`: if your jquery collection already consists of all forms you can get the one with a given id by doing myFormCollection.filter("#id")
[08:41:39] <pachet> now, let's say you want to grab all elements of class 'foo' within that object
[08:41:53] <hex`> what I'm doing, to give context: I want to dismiss all error messages which are child divs inside a form
[08:41:55] <pachet> you'd use : $form.find('.foo') or $('.foo', $form)
[08:42:03] <hex`> with the *class* error, not id as I said
[08:42:16] <pachet> hex`: i'm glad it's a class, not an id
[08:42:29] <pachet> because specifying an id within a context is redundant
[08:42:58] <hex`> hmm, now I get pachet
[08:43:02] <hex`> ty!
[08:43:10] <oodletech> Sorry to ask again, is there a certain "live/on" event for 'Extension was Called' or 'Element changed to Visible'?
[08:43:21] <`poo> what is Extension was Called ?
[08:43:50] <oodletech> So, for example, $.facebox({blah, blah})
[08:44:12] <oodletech> A jquery extension was called/used
[08:44:23] <`poo> no there's no such event
[08:44:37] <oodletech> How about for a Dom element becoming invisible?
[08:44:43] <oodletech> Sorry, visible
[08:44:56] <dabear_> oodletech: there is no reliable way to do that
[08:44:58] <`poo> not that i know of
[08:45:16] <dabear_> (allthough there are dom mutation events, which you'd not wanna use)
[08:45:33] <`poo> this is probably a case of-
[08:45:34] <`poo> ?xy
[08:45:35] <bot-t> You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[08:45:48] <pachet> oodletech: var _old_show = $.fn.show; $.fn.show = function ( speed, callback ) { $(this).trigger('show'); return _old_show.apply(this, arguments); }
[08:46:06] <pachet> oodletech: $(foo).bind('show', function ( ) {alert('shown!');}); $(foo).show();
[08:46:19] <`poo> huh?
[08:46:35] <`poo> that's just redefining .show() ...
[08:47:22] <xec> `poo: yes, and triggering a "show" event
[08:47:31] <`poo> yes, only when .show() is called
[08:47:36] <`poo> as if that's the only way to show an element ?
[08:47:44] <pachet> it's just an example
[08:47:49] <xec> i think that's beside the point
[08:47:58] <`poo> he didn't ask about .show()
[08:48:04] <xec> it doesnt matter
[08:48:22] <`poo> if you say so
[08:48:23] <xec> if you need to have an event triggered when you load a plugin, that would be a possible way to do it
[08:48:35] <pachet> (which is half of what he asked about, anyway)
[08:48:52] <`poo> less than half, but ok ;
[08:48:53] <`poo> ;)
[08:49:10] <oodletech> All I really need is, listen for a dom element to become invisible, add a callback
[08:49:17] <oodletech> become visible (srory)
[08:49:58] <xec> oodletech: maybe this can help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4561845/firing-event-on-dom-attribute-change
[08:50:41] <xec> oodletech: but the cleaner way would be to tap into the code that is showing this element in the first place
[08:50:45] <pachet> oodletech : how are you showing the element?
[08:51:29] <oodletech> Well, the actual implementation is facebox, but it's from a former developer (and scattered across multiple pages) so if there was a way to implement without finding and tracking down all of those calls I'd prefer it
[08:52:08] <dabear_> oodletech: bad idea
[08:52:27] <oodletech> Bad idea referring to what? Not finding each call?
[08:52:27] <dabear_> dom mutation events/ dom mutation observers are badly supported
[08:52:34] <oodletech> That's what I hear
[08:53:14] <codemagician> if I create a dialog with a form inside, should I avoid posting back data to the server using the standard submit way?
[08:53:45] <codemagician> should the form be managed using AJAX requests
[08:53:47] <dabear_> best solution: use chome, find the element you want, right click it in the elements panel in the inspector
[08:53:58] <dabear_> "break on attribute modification"
[08:54:04] <dabear_> and step up
[08:54:07] <pachet> oodletech: are you checking for when the #facebox div itself becomes visible?
[08:54:20] <dabear_> you'll easily find any calls to that function changing the visibility of the elment

[08:58:16] <codemagician> pachet: at the moment, the whole browser redirects to the response, thus killing of the webapp
[08:58:52] <pachet> well, then yeah you'd send it via xhr :[
[08:59:38] <codemagician> pachet: is there a standard way of posting to the server and throwing the result into the current context?

[09:04:55] <raj> perhaps not concat
[09:05:26] <codemagician> pachet: so then the <div id="area"> contains some HTML with a <form action="serverside.php" method="post">
[09:06:09] <codemagician> pachet: I'm guessing I should be having the javascript (jQuery) intercept the submit and do an AJAX based request to post back the form, and prevent the standard submit from occuring?
[09:06:37] <pachet> codemagician: yes
[09:08:01] <codemagician> pachet: so is there a particular way to do this server-side request and throw the resulting HTML back into the same dialog, keeping the interaction going in the current context (from the perspective of the user using the web-app)?
[09:10:42] <pachet> sure, $('#myForm').on('submit.mynamespace', function(event){$(this).load('some_path.php', $(this).serialize()); event.preventDefault(); return false;});

[09:27:05] <DennisRas> I guess it's a flaw in my design? Because it works well in a fiddle :S No idea what could cause this. Here's a fiddle example where it works: http://jsfiddle.net/f4YFL/4/
[09:27:36] <DennisRas> Oh and the first statement I posted here, actually works UNTIL I scroll.
[09:27:57] <Tasser> astropirate, d'oh
[09:28:45] <DennisRas> Oh snap, I hope someone can help. Been googling for 2 days now
[09:30:35] <polygon-pusher> I cant seem to get any kind of mouse event to work, what are common issues with mouse events and absolute positions?
[09:32:03] <polygon-pusher> for example I have jQuery("#hero-red-bag").click(function() { that outputs a console.log("click"); for http://what-a-ya-nuts.spryplayground.com/ FYI that id is of the red bag on the hero
[09:38:08] <Whirl3d> hey all. I'm trying to write a custom animation plugin that allows for state-enabled animations to fire sequentially for a group of items. The sequencing engine would fire each animation and return a promise that, when the animation was finished, it would resolve. Then the master animation sequence, once it got all the promises from all the elements resolved, would resolve it's own deferred.
[09:38:43] <Whirl3d> This would allow me to use the notation: $(item).xanimate(props, acts).then(startTimer);
[09:40:50] <Whirl3d> I'm just getting a little bogged down in the implementation of the deferreds and trying to make it recursive. Anyone have any ideas? Or maybe suggestions for another approach, or just some basic heckling for being stupid? Anything?
[09:43:18] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d:
[09:43:25] <johnkpaul> make it recursive?
[09:43:44] <johnkpaul> so you have an array of referreds
[09:43:53] <johnkpaul> and you want something to happen when all of them are resolved?
[09:44:04] <johnkpaul> fulfilled rather, I always forget the exact terminology
[09:44:07] <Whirl3d> Yeah. Each item in this nested heirarchy needs to eventaully run the same animate script with it's own settings
[09:44:14] <johnkpaul> ?jQuery.when @Whirl3d
[09:44:14] <bot-t> Whirl3d, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[09:44:46] <johnkpaul> you can pass in any amount of deferreds, and that will return a new promise that will be resolved when all of the internal ones are resolved
[09:46:10] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, that will be a big help. I'm just having a hard time figure out how to write it.
[09:46:31] <Whirl3d> For example, I have three items that need to animate down from the top of the div to a cusom resting place
[09:46:56] <Whirl3d> I initialize the elements and store the "hiding" and "active" locations in data object
[09:47:42] <Whirl3d> then, I start the first item animating...it looks for it's properties and executes the animate function, returning a promise.
[09:47:57] <Whirl3d> when the promise is resolved, I need to move to the next item.
[09:48:19] <polygon-pusher> so jQuery("#container #interactive #hero-red-bag") points to [<img id=​"hero-red-bag" ...... >​] but jQuery("#container #interactive #hero-red-bag").mouseover(function(){console.log("over")}); wont work?
[09:48:24] <johnkpaul> that's what .then() is for, Whirl3d
[09:48:37] <Whirl3d> Right.
[09:48:50] <johnkpaul> polygon-pusher: it should work fine, but you don't need a three level deep css selector with the id
[09:49:00] <johnkpaul> just use $("#hero-red-bag").mouseover
[09:49:01] <imsky> ajpiano, you around?
[09:49:27] <polygon-pusher> I know I was just trying it be as literal as possible  when making my selection thought it might help
[09:49:28] <Whirl3d> so I use $("elem").first().xanimate(props, acts).done($("elem").next().......
[09:49:30] <polygon-pusher> but it didnt
[09:49:46] <johnkpaul> polygon-pusher: are you sure that there is only one element with that id?
[09:49:50] <johnkpaul> ?demo @polygon-pusher
[09:49:50] <bot-t> polygon-pusher, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:49:56] <polygon-pusher> http://what-a-ya-nuts.spryplayground.com/
[09:50:11] <polygon-pusher> have a go in the console
[09:50:13] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: .done returns deferred
[09:50:17] <johnkpaul> not jquery
[09:50:32] <johnkpaul> oh, sorry, that was a mistake in my reading your code Whirl3d
[09:50:36] <skylamer`> how to check dom loaded when all the scripts have been executed and loaded?
[09:50:38] <Whirl3d> sorry, resolveWith()
[09:50:56] <Whirl3d> that way the done function is applied to the scope of the deferred target
[09:50:59] <johnkpaul> ?.ready @skylamer`
[09:50:59] <bot-t> skylamer`, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[09:51:26] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I think I need to see your code to understand what it is you're trying to do
[09:51:39] <johnkpaul> polygon-pusher: what am I supposed to be looking at here?
[09:51:49] <Whirl3d> cool. cool. Gimme just a minute to finish up this fiddle
[09:51:55] <Whirl3d> thanks for your input btw
[09:51:56] <skylamer`> no
[09:51:59] <skylamer`> no that
[09:52:18] <johnkpaul> np, Whirl3d
[09:52:24] <johnkpaul> skylamer`: what do you mean?
[09:53:03] <polygon-pusher> johnkpaul:  try jQuery("#hero-red-bag") and jQuery("#container #interactive #hero-red-bag").mouseover(function(){console.log("over")});
[09:53:06] <skylamer`> when the scripts we have are executed and they're ready with modifying all the DOM things, i want after that to bind a handlers
[09:53:09] <polygon-pusher> oops sorry
[09:53:30] <polygon-pusher> jQuery("#hero-red-bag").mouseover(function(){console.log("test");}); is what I meant
[09:54:10] <polygon-pusher> you will see that jQuery("#hero-red-bag")  gets the right image but I cant seem to get it to dispatch mouse events
[09:55:36] <johnkpaul> polygon-pusher: hmm, I see the same problem, but I don't know why
[09:55:46] <johnkpaul> oh
[09:55:47] <johnkpaul> yes I do
[09:55:53] <johnkpaul> z-index -1
[09:55:59] <polygon-pusher> oh
[09:56:25] <johnkpaul> skylamer`: document.ready will be after all of the dom is ready, which should be after all of the other javascript on the page in script tags have finished downloading and/or executing
[09:56:27] <polygon-pusher> so z index will play in effect to mouse events?
[09:56:42] <johnkpaul> polygon-pusher: yes, if something is "behind" the page, the mouse can't be over it
[09:56:51] <polygon-pusher> I didnt realize jquery looks at depths
[09:56:56] <johnkpaul> for a more precise udnerstanding, I'd ask #css
[09:56:58] <johnkpaul> jquery doesn't
[09:57:00] <johnkpaul> the browser does
[09:57:06] <polygon-pusher> ah
[09:57:10] <johnkpaul> jquery just says "hey browser, when this element is moused over, call this function"
[09:57:18] <johnkpaul> the browser decides when the element is mousedover
[09:57:22] <skylamer`> no
[09:57:32] <skylamer`> its after downloading
[09:57:32] <johnkpaul> I mean, there are some things that jquery does to gloss over the differences between browsers
[09:57:35] <polygon-pusher> thanks for looking into it johnkpaul
[09:57:38] <johnkpaul> np, polygon-pusher
[09:57:38] <skylamer`> but rarely 'executing'
[09:57:48] <johnkpaul> skylamer`: then something else is wrong
[09:57:53] <skylamer`> yea
[09:58:11] <skylamer`> i just made a little change and refactoring
[09:58:16] <johnkpaul> the document ready event fires after all of the javascript is executed, I'm fairly sure
[09:58:21] <skylamer`> and working,
[09:58:43] <johnkpaul> unless you add more javascript in document.ready
[09:58:50] <johnkpaul> are you using a script loader or something?
[10:01:28] <skylamer`> no for now
[10:02:33] <tomasm-> hi, i have an event handler, set via $(window).load(function() { ... }), but for some reason, I get "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'apply'"... any idea why?
[10:03:43] <`poo> tomasm-: that is not enough info
[10:04:28] <tomasm-> `poo, well thats all the info i got..... but it seems that $(window).bind('load') works and $(window).load() doesnt
[10:05:42] <Industrial> I have a (to me) difficult problem involving CSS and jQuery. I have a menu that I set to position: fixed; top: 0; once i scroll past it so it 'sticks' to the top of the page
[10:06:10] <`poo> tomasm-: .load( handler ) is exactly the same as .bind('load',handler)
[10:06:29] <Industrial> but when that happens the menu pops to the left, doesn't seem to have the same width anymore
[10:06:36] <Industrial> https://gist.github.com/b5ee6a42eb9379713b5e
[10:06:50] <Industrial> even though i don't specify the width in the css nor the js
[10:07:02] <Industrial> (actually, it's defined in Twitter Bootstrap's css)
[10:07:38] <johnkpaul> Industrial: this is a css question but position fixed has a different way of calculating width than position:static
[10:07:57] <johnkpaul> I don't know the details though
[10:08:07] <johnkpaul> hav eyou tried adding an explicit width to your position fixed element?
[10:08:23] <johnkpaul> also, I'd recommend adding a css class, rather than setting the css directly on scroll, Industrial
[10:08:49] <johnkpaul> then your javascript will be much simpler
[10:08:55] <Industrial> right :)
[10:08:59] <james13433> Can anyone explain to me why on this I can set the html but not val of an input? http://jsfiddle.net/JM7UV/1/
[10:09:55] <skylamer`> how to get the 'classList' number 2
[10:10:03] <skylamer`> if i have some thing like 'class otherclass'
[10:10:07] <skylamer`> on the leemnets
[10:10:39] <skylamer`> element.classList[1] ?
[10:10:41] <`poo> james13433: you cant set the value of a td element
[10:10:52] <`poo> or, you can, but it wont get you anywhere
[10:10:53] <james13433> poo, its an input.
[10:11:10] <`poo> james13433: $(this).parents('tr').children('.price')
[10:11:18] <`poo> children of the <tr> are <td>
[10:11:19] <`poo> not inputs.
[10:11:32] <`poo> <td class="price">
[10:11:34] <`poo> td.
[10:11:41] <johnkpaul> james13433: you want .find(".price")
[10:11:43] <james13433> ahh so thats why,
[10:11:47] <johnkpaul> not .children(".price")
[10:12:08] <DennisRas> How come no matter what I do this is always off by 14 pixels? if (elem.prop('scrollHeight') - elem.scrollTop() == elem.outerHeight()) {
[10:12:09] <james13433> perfect thanks guys
[10:13:32] <james13433> johnkpaul would you say .parents('tr').find('.price') is the best way to get to that? seems going up then down is messy to me?
[10:13:40] <johnkpaul> DennisRas: is there a horizontal scrollbar?
[10:14:04] <DennisRas> overflow-y set to auto, no visible horizontal bar now
[10:14:06] <DennisRas> no*
[10:14:19] <johnkpaul> DennisRas: hmm, I don't know, can you make a demo?
[10:14:50] <johnkpaul> james13433: I mean, that's a fine way to do that using purely jquery, if you're doing that too much, IMHO, you're looking for an architecutre on top of jquery
[10:15:06] <johnkpaul> of the mvsomething variety, perhaps backbone, perhaps ember, perhaps another of the million options
[10:16:01] <DennisRas> johnkpaul, that's the thing... the demo works but on production it doesn't. Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/f4YFL/4/ - My attempt: http://hhinfo.dk/new.html (check console for numbers)
[10:16:04] <james13433> Yeah its only for one page on a quick-order-form so I guess ill just leave it,
[10:16:28] <johnkpaul> james13433: be careful with that, sooner or later there are dozens of those one pages
[10:17:03] <DennisRas> johnkpaul, it works initially, but after you scroll and then back to the bottom, it's off by 14px
[10:17:39] <DennisRas> Been trying to fix this issue for 2 days now :/
[10:18:09] <johnkpaul> hm, DennisRas, my guess is that something is wrong with the css
[10:18:12] <johnkpaul> but there's nothing obvious
[10:18:23] <DennisRas> Yes that's my theory too. It has to be
[10:18:33] <DennisRas> Since it works out of the box, but not on that page
[10:18:51] <DennisRas> But as you can see there's hardly any CSS involved (it's all 1 test file)
[10:19:03] <johnkpaul> so what I'd probably do, even though it might not be the smartest, is just start removing classes from all of the surrounding containers
[10:19:07] <johnkpaul> make a test case for this
[10:19:16] <johnkpaul> some code that you can run to see if the issue is still happening
[10:19:31] <johnkpaul> so you don't have to manually scroll it every time
[10:19:49] <johnkpaul> and then keep removing things until you've pinpointed what could cause it
[10:20:06] <DennisRas> It autoadds context and prints numbers for me to look at. Not sure what other kind of code you're thinking of
[10:20:18] <DennisRas> And yeah I'll debug the css
[10:22:27] <DennisRas> johnkpaul, Removed everything imaginable. Floats. The entire design except for the chat window. Still off by 14
[10:23:30] <johnkpaul> so start removing styles from the chat window
[10:24:31] <msch> hi, what's coming in jquery ui 1.9?
[10:24:49] <`poo> spinners
[10:24:52] <`poo> menus
[10:25:22] <msch> `poo: thanks
[10:26:07] <DennisRas> johnkpaul, http://hhinfo.dk/scroll.html
[10:28:19] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, here is a watered down version of what I am hoping to accomplish: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/kMZMv/2/
[10:29:42] <johnkpaul> DennisRas: is there a way I can stop the scroll ?
[10:30:08] <wanderingi> http://pastebin.ca/2142018  i have this code that loops every 10 seconds, but when i alert the value of data, it just alerts 0. The php script definitely returns the number it is supposed to.
[10:30:22] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: so what part of this is not working?
[10:30:43] <johnkpaul> the $.when(promises) part should be a syntax error
[10:30:45] <Whirl3d> sry. Just the .when parth
[10:30:50] <Whirl3d> 8)
[10:31:36] <Whirl3d> See, the problem is that if I do a collection to xanimate(), I need each piece to be animated sequentiallly.
[10:31:50] <Whirl3d> so, .when works if I do them simultaneously
[10:31:54] <DennisRas> johnkpaul, added stop button
[10:32:06] <msch> `poo: do you know where i can get a prebuild jquery-ui 1.9 like https://github.com/lukemelia/jquery-ui-ember/blob/master/js/libs/jquery-ui-1.9pre.js ?
[10:32:13] <johnkpaul> oh, Whirl3d, you want serial, not parallel
[10:32:51] <Whirl3d> but before, what I did was make a "animateNext' local function  that looked to see if there were any others on the stack, if so, it would run them, receive a promise, etc. If not, it would resolve it's own deferred
[10:33:16] <johnkpaul> ?.pipe @Whirl3d
[10:33:16] <bot-t> Whirl3d, deferred.pipe([doneFilter], [failFilter]): [New in v1.6] Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[10:33:39] <johnkpaul> you want to pipe all of these together, and then have a promise that is the result of every promise being resolved in serial
[10:33:41] <johnkpaul> right?
[10:33:41] <Whirl3d> JOY! I bet this is exactly what I needed!
[10:34:28] <Whirl3d> you are sooo good. I will read up on it right away. Thanks. I wasn't sure if I could explain what I needed and you got it right away.!
[10:35:06] <johnkpaul> :) Whirl3d, thanks, it's no problem
[10:35:23] <johnkpaul> so Whirl3d, it might be useful for you to watch this screencast that I did on deferreds
[10:35:34] <johnkpaul> and I'm planning on making one about serial vs parallel ajax calls
[10:36:00] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: https://vimeo.com/40793064
[10:36:11] <johnkpaul> DennisRas: why are you using outerHeight?
[10:36:46] <DennisRas> Because of the border? And because it works here: http://jsfiddle.net/f4YFL/4/
[10:37:23] <DennisRas> It works now though by using clientheight
[10:37:43] <DennisRas> Now I've just changed my code completely to match the fiddle except for the clientheight
[10:38:46] <johnkpaul> DennisRas: but the scrollHeight doesn't take intoa ccount the border
[10:39:00] <DennisRas> johnkpaul, I've found the error. Just a theory though, but it seems like the .append method is slower than the calculation happening afterwards
[10:39:16] <DennisRas> Not sure if that makes sense
[10:39:33] <DennisRas> D'oh, of course... that is my bad -.-
[10:39:44] <DennisRas> I check to see if the scrollbar is at the bottom AFTER it appends
[10:39:50] <DennisRas> Which it of course won't be
[10:40:01] <johnkpaul> ah, yes
[10:40:21] <DennisRas> I have to check BEFORE I append and then reposition the scrollbar based on the position before the appending
[10:41:37] <msch> is this part of the supported jquery-ui api? jQuery.ui['draggable']({},$('#someView'))?
[10:42:35] <DennisRas> johnkpaul, there we go: http://hhinfo.dk/new.html
[10:43:00] <johnkpaul> :) great job, DennisRas, I'm glad it's working
[10:43:24] <DennisRas> Never worked with scrolling before, so I somehow just borked it
[10:46:18] <DennisRas> johnkpaul, Thank you.
[10:46:33] <johnkpaul> no problem, DennisRas, have fun
[10:46:59] <zim> Hi all. if I  --> $(document).ready(function() { $.fn.formLabels(); }); My problem is that new fields added by ajax are not included is there a way to do this. like .live for clicks?
[10:48:09] <DennisRas> You have to recode formLabels
[10:48:30] <zim> ok ty
[10:48:37] <DennisRas> Well unless you want to listen to the entire document for changes, but that's heavy?
[10:49:37] <zim> heavy?
[10:53:25] <johnkpaul> zim: there is a dom mutation event in some browsers
[10:53:41] <johnkpaul> but there's no standard jquery way to listen for all changes in the dom
[10:53:50] <johnkpaul> why don't you just call your plugin on new elements
[10:54:00] <johnkpaul> after you append the elements to the dom
[10:54:44] <zim> ok but I guess it will still double attach to elements that are there
[10:57:21] <johnkpaul> zim: why?
[10:57:27] <johnkpaul> just add it to the new elements
[10:58:05] <zim> Ty will work it out
[10:58:55] <johnkpaul> zim: or, check if that plugin guards against double adding
[10:59:12] <zim> Will do TY
[11:01:17] <wanderingi> see if you have code inside setInterval, does it wait the length of the interval before executing or does it execute and then wait the interval before executing again?
[11:06:13] <pflock> is there something like echo in php that just ends code to the end of a div or something?
[11:07:21] <pflock> is there something like echo in php that just ends code to the end of a div or something?
[11:07:32] <polygon-pusher> any recomendtions for a simple rotate plugin?
[11:07:39] <polygon-pusher> blaaaa, typing is crap today
[11:08:00] <polygon-pusher> recommendations *
[11:12:08] <msch> Is there something like jQuery.ui.makeElementInto($('#something'), 'draggable')
[11:12:46] <kinesis> How do I apply the .draggable element to a table cell? would i have to put a <div id="cell-1">text</div> in each cell?
[11:13:30] <PhonicUK> Hey all, can I get a quick couple of thoughts about a utility i'm building for jquery?
[11:13:35] <PhonicUK> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Hil2Suyyo
[11:17:18] <supertrue> @phonicUK looks very cool
[11:17:30] <PhonicUK> :)
[11:17:35] <PhonicUK> it's quite cool how it works under the hoot
[11:17:37] <PhonicUK> *hood
[11:17:44] <PhonicUK> what you're actually doing is constructing a 'document'
[11:17:51] <PhonicUK> and a peice of code builds the UI from the document
[11:18:02] <supertrue> is it all with jquery ui?
[11:18:04] <PhonicUK> yup
[11:18:24] <pojo> Hi has any body used electricprism calendar.I need to refresh the calender display when i change the date in input dynamically
[11:18:24] <supertrue> that's great
[11:27:46] <msch> PhonicUK: if you can deliver then that's incredible. it's like Visual Basic for the Web. and that's a good thing.
[11:30:23] <shoky> derp
[11:32:08] <shoky> PhonicUK what kind of thoughts are you looking for
[11:32:22] <johnkpaul> doesn't extjs have a builder similar to taht
[11:32:40] <johnkpaul> http://www.projectspace.nl/
[11:34:45] <shoky> everybody and their sister has a gui builder
[11:35:54] <bitbuzzer> Hi, any knockout.js fans?
[11:35:58] <shoky> bitbuzzer: yes
[11:38:00] <bitbuzzer> shoky: never used it before, any examples of mid to large apps with it? A tutorial maybe?
[11:38:31] <shoky> the main site has nice tutorials and examples
[11:38:51] <PhonicUK> msch, thats what I'm building :)
[11:39:01] <PhonicUK> shoky, just initial impressions
[11:39:08] <shoky> ok: looks like VB
[11:39:29] <PhonicUK> righto
[11:39:36] <PhonicUK> thats the vibe i'm going for :)
[11:40:03] <shoky> enjoy
[11:40:40] <msch> PhonicUK: how long till there's an alpha?
[11:40:56] <PhonicUK> i'll have something to 'play around with' in a few days
[11:42:14] <PhonicUK> @msch
[11:42:21] <Whirl3d> why doesn't .css() return an elements' css properties but .css(props) sets them?
[11:42:25] <msch> PhonicUK: great
[11:42:25] <bitbuzzer> shoky: how do you manage html partial templates? Load them dynamically via Ajax, or statically in the html on initial rendering?
[11:42:53] <shoky> bitbuzzer both are possible
[11:43:16] <PhonicUK> Whirl3d, .css("property") would get you a specific property
[11:43:44] <bitbuzzer> shoky: any guidelines for choosing how to go about it? Thx
[11:44:18] <Whirl3d> sure. But it seems logically consistent with jQuery's nomenclature that $(elem).css() would list all of the explicitly set css properties for an element.
[11:44:28] <shoky> bitbuzzer sorry i dont have enough experience with it to recommend general guidelines.. if you run into a specific issue i'll be glad to help ;p
[11:44:34] <Whirl3d> PhonicUK, thanks for the reply, too. Didn't mean to be rude
[11:45:01] <PhonicUK> dw i didn't take it as being rude :)
[11:47:08] <ancestral> I'm trying to read in a text file which has a different file extension (.map) using either $jQuery.get() or $jQuery.ajax(). I've tried setting the dataType to 'text' but I still get an error; it complains about a syntax error, unrecognized expression from the text file
[11:47:12] <shoky> Whirl3d: "explicitly set" ?
[11:47:39] <ancestral> Any tricks to read a text file which doesn't have a .txt file extension?
[11:48:06] <shoky> file extension shouldn't matter
[11:49:12] <Whirl3d> yeah, I realized after I said that that I should probably clarify. I don't necessarily need all of the inherited properties, just the properties set with jquery. Just the css attributes that are different from the element the way it was written in the dom....I'm still not explaining it very well am I.  lol
[11:49:39] <shoky> and if you dynamically add a class?
[11:49:42] <shoky> or remove
[11:49:43] <shoky> etc.
[11:49:47] <Whirl3d> right
[11:49:57] <Whirl3d> so you could see that without jquery it would be like this:
[11:50:04] <Whirl3d> with jquery it is like this:
[11:50:07] <Lyfesaver> hello, i am trying to get custum scrollbars to work, but no matter what I do, it will not layout horizontal
[11:50:12] <Lyfesaver> http://lyfesaver.net/benz/
[11:50:19] <Lyfesaver> thats result I am getting
[11:50:27] <Lyfesaver> and I am telling the js to go horizontal
[11:50:42] <Lyfesaver> even if I wanted to stay verticle....
[11:50:48] <Lyfesaver> my results are not right
[11:50:56] <shoky> Whirl3d did you paste something?
[11:51:41] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, here is the first thing that may help: put your code (inclduing your scripts) in the header.
[11:51:55] <ancestral> I think I've got it
[11:51:58] <Lyfesaver> ohhhh
[11:51:59] <Whirl3d> the problem is that you are loading yoru script after your call to it
[11:52:06] <Lyfesaver> i was just following everyhitng here to the T
[11:52:07] <Lyfesaver> http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller
[11:52:23] <Lyfesaver> he says to put it b4 closing body tag
[11:52:25] <Lyfesaver> so i did
[11:52:27] <Lyfesaver> but i will movie it
[11:52:29] <Lyfesaver> =)
[11:52:37] <Lyfesaver> move*
[11:53:10] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, did you see in "how to use it" it says to put it in the head element.
[11:53:38] <Lyfesaver> "The final step is to include the actual custom scrollbar plugin (jquery.mCustomScrollbar.js) and the function that calls and configures the scrollbar(s) at the end of your document, just before the closing body tag."
[11:53:54] <Whirl3d> How to use it
[11:53:54] <Whirl3d> In order to implement the plugin, you first need to insert inside the head tag of your document the jquery.min.js and jquery-ui.min.js
[11:54:05] <Lyfesaver> ya i did that part in the head
[11:54:12] <Whirl3d> it goes on from there.
[11:54:15] <Lyfesaver> ya
[11:54:21] <Lyfesaver> i have all that in the head
[11:54:30] <Lyfesaver> i cut and pasted what he has in his head in my head
[11:54:34] <Whirl3d> put your scrollbar script in there too
[11:54:37] <Lyfesaver> i did
[11:54:43] <Lyfesaver> after u said so
[11:54:52] <Lyfesaver> still no change
[11:55:23] <Whirl3d> then change his line $(window).load(function () {....
[11:55:56] <Whirl3d> in the header, start a new script tag and use: $(document).ready(function () { his scrollbar code});
[11:55:56] <rhodesjason> hey everyone
[11:56:15] <Lyfesaver> his scrollbar code?
[11:56:21] <Lyfesaver> i dont know jquery
[11:56:24] <rhodesjason> once I use "appendTo" to add something to the DOM, shouldn't I be able to get its height using .height() immediately?
[11:56:29] <Lyfesaver> so telling me things like that confuse me
[11:56:37] <Lyfesaver> i am just trying to use his script
[11:56:40] <shoky> rhodesjason: yeh
[11:57:03] <Whirl3d> $("container").mCustomScrollbar("horizontal", 400, "easeOutBack", 1.05}); it looks like
[11:57:11] <Lyfesaver> ohhh that part
[11:57:22] <rhodesjason> shoky: I'm running code where .height() always returns 0, but if I access that same div in the console, it returns the real height
[11:57:35] <shoky> ajax involved?
[11:57:52] <rhodesjason> no, hold on i'll show
[11:59:15] <Lyfesaver> Whirl3d,
[11:59:15] <Lyfesaver> <script>
[11:59:15] <Lyfesaver> 		$(window).load(function() {
[11:59:15] <Lyfesaver> 			$(document).ready(function () { $("#mcs_container").mCustomScrollbar("horizontal",400,"easeOutCirc",1.05,"auto","yes","yes",10);});
[11:59:16] <Lyfesaver> 		});
[11:59:16] <Lyfesaver> 		</script>
[11:59:21] <Lyfesaver> shoot
[11:59:41] <shoky> no reason to put DOM ready handler inside window load handler
[12:00:04] <Whirl3d> Create a fiddle with your code so we can work on it together. go to jsfiddle.net and paste your pieces..css, html, and the jquery each in their respective panel
[12:00:37] <Lyfesaver> what is jsfiddle?
[12:00:40] <Lyfesaver> this is crazy
[12:00:44] <Lyfesaver> now i got to try something else
[12:00:49] <shoky> ?jsfiddle @ Lyfesaver
[12:00:50] <bot-t> Lyfesaver, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[12:01:14] <rhodesjason> https://gist.github.com/32c4d6a7b4e7afa0b318
[12:02:09] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, it's really easy to do and because it provides a testbed to work on, it makes it easy to change and to look up later when you return to your site. It's not at all intimidating and there's very little new to learn.
[12:02:36] <Lyfesaver> okay i will just cut and paste what is in his example then
[12:02:38] <Lyfesaver> from his page
[12:02:44] <Lyfesaver> cuz that is all i am using
[12:03:05] <Lyfesaver> completely balnk HTML and CSS... then cut and paste his code
[12:03:06] <shoky> rhodesjason you got a var height inside the anonymous function
[12:03:07] <Lyfesaver> sec
[12:03:07] <Zah_> I'm trying to add css to an iframe with a specific class but it doesn't appear to work
[12:03:34] <shoky> rhodesjason you sure it's not an issue with accessing the wrong height variable ?
[12:03:50] <Zah_> Currently, I'm doing it as follows: $('.iframe-class').contents().find('html').css('stuff','stuff')
[12:03:53] <shoky> cause when you set 'height = ...'  you're not setting that var height
[12:04:14] <rhodesjason> shoky: I just called it 'height' in that gist so it was clear
[12:04:16] <Zah_> Theres multiple iframes on the page
[12:04:24] <Zah_> What on earth am I doing wrong?
[12:04:26] <rhodesjason> the point is, in that gist, height is always 0
[12:04:30] <Lyfesaver> Whirl3d, this what u eant?
[12:04:31] <Lyfesaver> http://jsfiddle.net/73LNH/
[12:04:34] <Lyfesaver> meant*
[12:04:45] <rhodesjason> but in the console after the page loads, $(".myclass").height() returns the right height
[12:05:05] <shoky> fader.find( ".slide" ).height()  returns the right height?
[12:06:04] <rhodesjason> in the console after the page loads, $(".slide).height() returns the right height
[12:06:18] <Lyfesaver> http://jsfiddle.net/73LNH/1/
[12:06:27] <shoky> what about fader.find( ".slide" ).height()
[12:06:36] <rhodesjason> fader isn't a global variable
[12:06:44] <rhodesjason> so i won't be able to call that from the console
[12:06:48] <shoky> then replace it with a jq selector, whatever
[12:06:57] <shoky> and call that from the console
[12:07:20] <shoky> anyway it's best if you put a testcase showing the problem at jsfiddle.net
[12:07:26] <rhodesjason> well the problem is
[12:07:27] <biesbjerg> hey guys, has anyone stumbled upon a query plugin acting as a fallback for the "form"-attribute on non-supporting browsers (orphaned form controls)
[12:07:27] <shoky> don't think we'll get far otherwise
[12:07:29] <rhodesjason> it works fine on jsfiddle
[12:07:40] <rhodesjason> i built this script there
[12:07:45] <Lyfesaver> 18 hours i have been at this
[12:07:48] <rhodesjason> but when i moved it to my local machine, it stopped working
[12:07:53] <rhodesjason> $("#fader").find(".slide").height() returns the right height
[12:08:03] <rhodesjason> here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rhodesjason/z32Yg/1/
[12:08:10] <Lyfesaver> i can't believe jquery is sooo difficult
[12:08:51] <polygon-pusher> How do I interrupt an animation?  I'm trying to use stop(true, false) before the next animation but I looks as if it quickly finishs the animation any ways instead of animating to the new animation.   http://what-a-ya-nuts.spryplayground.com/ if you look there are two side pannels this zoom in and out really fast even though I way to to say out if you mouse over the next item
[12:08:58] <Lyfesaver> ASP.NET, Razor MVC, C#, VB, C++ all this is can do..... but include a simple jquery script and nothing works
[12:09:16] <Lyfesaver> how did this language EVER get acepted?
[12:09:32] <gloomer> jquery is easy
[12:09:40] <Lyfesaver> sure it is
[12:09:44] <gloomer> basically css with javascript
[12:09:44] <Lyfesaver> i cant tell
[12:09:47] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, I am too old and cranky to put up with your attitude. You don't want help, you wanna bitch. Go somewhere else to do it. I have had enough.
[12:09:48] <Lyfesaver> ppl keep telling me that
[12:10:25] <Lyfesaver> Excuse me for getting aggrivated and ranting after spending 18 hours on your suggestion Whirl......
[12:10:32] <Lyfesaver> i do appologize
[12:10:34] <Lyfesaver> u are right
[12:10:38] <Lyfesaver> it was uncalled for
[12:10:59] <Lyfesaver> but as for your help whir3d, thank you.... for trying.....
[12:11:11] <Whirl3d> here's my latest suggestion: change your diapers and go back to asp.net or what have you. Jquery is really easy and you are being a baby about it.
[12:11:31] <gloomer> what are you trying to do Lyfesaver?
[12:11:33] <rhodesjason> oh snap no he didnt
[12:11:45] <Lyfesaver> like I said... 18 hours on getting one script is enough to make anyone cranky Whirl3d
[12:11:58] <Lyfesaver> gloomer i am just trying to get the custom scrollbar script to work is all
[12:12:05] <Lyfesaver> no other content
[12:12:09] <Lyfesaver> other than the example content
[12:12:13] <Lyfesaver> and it wont work
[12:12:13] <gloomer> which custom scroll bar
[12:12:14] <gloomer> there are many
[12:12:19] <polygon-pusher> to sum up my last question if it was too long for you. How do prevent the animations from playing out even though I want to interrupt it.  example seen here http://what-a-ya-nuts.spryplayground.com/
[12:12:22] <Lyfesaver> http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller
[12:12:35] <Lyfesaver> and my results are here lyfesaver.net/benz/
[12:12:42] <Lyfesaver> http://lyfesaver.net/benz/
[12:14:21] <gloomer> ok one second let me look
[12:15:02] <Lyfesaver> But once again.... and I am being sincere, thank you for trying..... but I just hope u understand that not everyone is perfect. I am stressed at this and venting a little. Sorry if it upset you SO much. Seriously. But name calling and putting someone down personaly was all done by you. =)
[12:15:09] <Lyfesaver> Thank you very much gloomer =)
[12:15:11] <polygon-pusher> so .stop(true, false); is still jumping to end. Is this not valid ?
[12:15:30] <Lyfesaver> that first part was for you Whirl3d
[12:19:29] <Lyfesaver> gloomer, if u know of another custom scrollbar script i can try and use thats okay by me too. I am not married to this script. I have webkit styling working, but IE and FF dont take advatage of that, so I went with Whirl3d's suggestion. And I am sure it is a good script, I am just too ignorant in jQuery to debug why it does not work for me but does for SO many others.
[12:20:42] <shoky> maybe they're not ignorant in jquery
[12:21:36] <b1lly> Lyfesaver: jscrollpane?
[12:21:57] <Lyfesaver> good point shoky =)
[12:22:09] <Lyfesaver> kk b1lly I will look at that one =) tyvm
[12:25:07] <rhodesjason> shoky: fixed the issue
[12:25:35] <rhodesjason> i was trying to read .height() on a div that contained an image -- so I needed to enclose the call inside of a .load() event to make sure the image had loaded
[12:25:46] <rhodesjason> no idea why it worked fine on jsfiddle...
[12:26:37] <Zah_> Anyone?
[12:27:13] <Zah_> Accessing the html node of an iframe, is this correct: $('.iframe-class').contents().find('html').css('stuff','stuff')
[12:38:20] <shoky> rhodesjason your fiddle had 'onLoad' selected
[12:41:58] <waldmeister> anyone around who can help with a question about the XMLHttpRequest object?
[12:45:04] <shokshok> Zah
[12:47:28] <Whirl3d> so is it appropriate, when writing a plugin, to check if a single item is calling the plugin method or whether a collection is? Then if it's a collection>1 of elements, is it appropriate to just use .each() to call the same method on each element?  if (this.length>1) {return this.each(function () {$(this).pluginname(arguments);});   ?
[12:47:35] <rhodesjason> shoky: oh... wow
[12:47:43] <rhodesjason> i'd never thought about that much!
[13:11:19] <xiam> how to test if a variable is a jquery selection?
[13:14:54] <johnkpaul> xiam: "selector" in variable && "jquery" in variable
[13:15:03] <johnkpaul> would probably be good enough
[13:19:14] <xiam> johnkpaul: thanks, selector will do
[13:19:19] <nlogax> xiam: x instanceof $
[13:20:05] <xiam> nlogax: that looks even nicer
[13:24:36] <johnkpaul> for some reason, in my head, I thougth that the fact that it was actually a "selection" was important, xiam
[13:24:52] <johnkpaul> all jquery objects will instanceof $
[13:25:10] <johnkpaul> only selections by css selector will have a .selector
[13:25:47] <johnkpaul> oh, actually, my code is wrong anyway, because .selector would be an empty string in that case, not undefined
[13:26:02] <shoky> jkp i like your 2 vids
[13:35:58] <PhonicUK> anyone know of a jquery plugin that provides the 'standard' form controls as styled objects?
[13:36:04] <PhonicUK> checkboxes, radio, dropdowns, etc
[13:44:36] <shoky> there's ninjaui
[13:44:53] <shoky> there's jqueryui
[13:53:12] <shoky> Whirl3d: 'this' should already be a collection, you can just .each whatever this.length is
[13:53:38] <johnkpaul> shoky: what vids?
[13:53:54] <shoky> jkp on the vimeo you posted earlier
[13:55:01] <johnkpaul> oh cool
[13:55:04] <johnkpaul> the callback screencast?
[13:55:19] <shoky> yah
[13:55:25] <johnkpaul> I actually started working on another one, screencasting is a lot harder than I originally thought
[13:55:54] <shoky> yeah i'd imagine it's not a smooth experience
[13:57:11] <johnkpaul> well, hopefuly it is as smooth as possible in the end, but it requires a lot of editing
[13:58:00] <shoky> let me know when yer done ;p
[13:58:12] <ancestral> I think I'm missing a callback here. The return value is undefined: http://pastebin.com/NegZEvYp
[13:58:28] <shoky> heh
[13:58:55] <shoky> ancestral: the code inside the $(document).ready  callback isn't being called before that return statement
[13:59:03] <johnkpaul> :-D
[13:59:14] <RPkS> johnkpaul: how are you today?
[13:59:22] <johnkpaul> RPkS: I'm doing well, how are you?
[13:59:36] <johnkpaul> shoky: my original goal for that screencast was to address ancestral's question
[13:59:46] <johnkpaul> it ended up being more advanced than that
[13:59:59] <johnkpaul> but the first few minutes might be helpful
[14:01:00] <shoky> they might
[14:01:09] <shoky> but then again, he's not doing an ajax call
[14:01:25] <johnkpaul> $.get is an ajax call
[14:01:25] <shoky> he's doing $(document).ready   in the middle of another function
[14:01:39] <shoky> oh oops
[14:01:54] <shoky> thought it was $.map
[14:02:22] <ancestral> Suggestions? I just want to return the data in a file
[14:03:13] <shoky> ancestral: add a callback to your ajax request. set your data variables there
[14:03:25] <johnkpaul> ancestral: if you want your ajax call to work as a regular ajax call, and not completely block the browser's UI, you can't "return" in that way
[14:03:25] <shoky> well you have a callback
[14:03:36] <johnkpaul> because the callback function happens after your original functions return
[14:03:39] <johnkpaul> returns*
[14:03:41] <shoky> er dont mind me . need_sleep
[14:05:11] <ancestral> Well, I guess I don't need it to be asynchronous
[14:05:17] <ancestral> So I could change that?
[14:05:54] <shoky> bad idea
[14:07:17] <ancestral> What's the other option here?
[14:07:24] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I'm doing good. I've been trying to find a way in CSS to make an entire product container react to a mouse touching any part of the div, BUT make it trigger a div that's inside of the larger div to swap a color regardless if the smaller div is touched or not.
[14:07:58] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I'm doing good. I've been trying to find a way in CSS to make an entire product container react to a mouse touching any part of the div, BUT make it trigger a div that's inside of the larger div to swap a color regardless if the smaller div is touched or not.
[14:08:13] <RPkS> oops, sorry for the double post
[14:08:44] <johnkpaul> ancestral: option 1) move your logic into your callback, option 2) use jQuery deferreds distant option 3) sync: false
[14:08:57] <johnkpaul> RPkS: in CSS?
[14:09:16] <RPkS> yes in CSS
[14:09:24] <RPkS> I'm not sure it's possible
[14:09:46] <RPkS> https://hiddencameragear.com/hidden-cameras/hidden-dvr-cameras
[14:10:10] <RPkS> I'm getting things tidier looking
[14:10:28] <johnkpaul> that's good
[14:10:34] <johnkpaul> if it's a CSS question, you should ask #css
[14:11:15] <shoky> ancestral: http://pastebin.com/epFUisei
[14:11:24] <shoky> jkp will say if i did it right
[14:11:35] <shoky> WONT HE
[14:12:23] <johnkpaul> :) yes, that looks right
[14:12:35] <johnkpaul> depends on what ancestral is trying to do, but that is a straightforward working conversion of ancestral's code
[14:12:35] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I've been to that channel and the things I was advised to try... Well I think some of them didn't quite grasp what I was asking to do.
[14:12:55] <johnkpaul> also, shoky, if you type the full nick, and not jkp, I'll see that someone talked to me immediately
[14:12:58] <johnkpaul> does your IRC client not do that?
[14:13:16] <shoky> it does. i can set many highlights
[14:13:25] <johnkpaul> RPkS: I know I'm a broken record with this opinion, but I still honestly believe that you would be much better off with hiring someone to complete this project for you
[14:13:26] <RPkS> some said said that jquery was a better choice and then arguing insued. LOL
[14:15:04] <RPkS> johnkpaul: I have come a long way and I understand MUCH more than I have, but I sat for months waitng on others to get stuff done, so I've taken charge and been grinding through the process
[14:15:31] <shoky> jkp i've no desire for immediate responses anyway so i'll keep calling you this way cause its cute and so r u, ok?!?!?!
[14:16:02] <johnkpaul> :), sure, works for me shoky
[14:16:10] <shoky> you'll just have to switch IRC clients!
[14:16:24] <RPkS> My product page isn't 100%, but it's a dramatic change from 3 weeks ago.
[14:16:56] <james13433> Whats the code to set the only class on something not to just add a class?
[14:16:58] <johnkpaul> RPkS: I'm not at all saying that you haven't done an amazing job, or that you have not done a very impressive amount of work since you first started
[14:17:21] <RPkS> I removed the extra bar heading bars and tightened things up all the way around.
[14:17:24] <johnkpaul> I'm just saying that your time might be better spent by hiring someone who would make these changes more quickly
[14:17:44] <johnkpaul> james13433: that sentence makes no sense to me :)
[14:18:11] <james13433> well you can add class e.g addClass("new") and then it will go to class="new old"
[14:18:13] <shoky> i think he wants to set THE class
[14:18:30] <johnkpaul> james13433: there's toggleClass
[14:18:36] <james13433> but I want it to completely replace any class thats already there
[14:18:56] <johnkpaul> $().get(0).className = "new"
[14:19:02] <shoky> [0] please
[14:19:15] <johnkpaul> although I'd reconsider your css structure if you realy need to do that, james13433
[14:19:40] <johnkpaul> if it is a binary, it might be better understood as "new" or "" rather than "new" and "old"
[14:19:51] <james13433> Well I just need to add either a success or error class
[14:20:26] <james13433> supposed I can just removeClass on the other, but I just thought this way would be easier as there never is any other class on it
[14:20:54] <johnkpaul> then toggleClass seems like it would be for you james13433
[14:21:08] <johnkpaul> ?toggleClass @james13433
[14:21:08] <bot-t> james13433, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[14:21:09] <james13433> but sometimes there is neither an error or sucess
[14:21:25] <johnkpaul> oh ok, then it's not binary like I thought
[14:23:02] <james13433> Thanks again johnkpaul
[14:23:11] <johnkpaul> no problem, james13433
[14:34:58] <hex`> .append appends right before the closing tag, is there a way to append right after the opening tag of the selected object?
[14:35:25] <Woet> hex`: prepend?
[14:36:18] <hex`> thanks... makes sense after someone englightens Woet
[14:37:09] <superdmp> hello - is getting the height of an element and applying it as a height style to another something that one would do using jquery? or is that straightforward thing one might do in JS without recourse to jquery?
[14:37:37] <shoky> superdmp: jquery's good for that
[14:37:53] <superdmp> shoky:  I have jquery loaded anyway
[14:38:00] <shoky> then use it
[14:39:24] <superdmp> on this page: http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/slider-test/ when you select the middle image you will see the yellow a#fancybox-left and a#fancybox-right under the white block
[14:39:36] <superdmp> in IE7, it's over them
[14:40:31] <superdmp> it's not simply a CSS matter; it's some interaction of the JS & CSS - so one solution would be to get the height of the image and apply it to the a#fancybox-left and a#fancybox-righ
[14:40:32] <superdmp> t

[15:14:36] <ParadoxQuine> hey, how do i prevent .draggable from adding position:relative to my elements?
[15:20:40] <sekyms> ajpiano: you around?
[15:21:12] <shoky> ParadoxQuine: i doubt if you can
[15:21:36] <ParadoxQuine> shoky: is there a reason? something about draggable that would require position relative?
[15:21:42] <sekyms> shaky will you take a look at something for me?
[15:23:23] <shoky> ParadoxQuine: the element needs to be positioned for it to be dragged from place to place
[15:29:31] <ParadoxQuine> shoky: right, but is there something wrong with absolute positioning?
[15:31:12] <shoky> ParadoxQuine: it doesn't change absolute to relative
[15:31:36] <shoky> .draggable(), that is
[15:31:52] <ParadoxQuine> it looks like it is in my code o.O
[15:32:14] <ParadoxQuine> i comment out the draggable call and refresh and my element no longer has style="positition:relative"
[15:32:32] <shoky> what does it have
[15:33:48] <ParadoxQuine> no style attrib added
[15:33:58] <shoky> no position?
[15:34:02] <ParadoxQuine> and my css class def has position:absolute already
[15:34:05] <shoky> ah
[15:34:10] <ParadoxQuine> so the things stack like they should
[15:34:28] <shoky> fiddle it :P
[15:37:32] <tw2113> *fiddles until he can fiddle no more*
[15:38:44] <shoky> looking at jqui draggable code
[15:39:03] <shoky> the only place where it changes the position to relative is:
[15:39:13] <shoky> 		if (this.options.helper == 'original' && !(/^(?:r|a|f)/).test(this.element.css("position")))
[15:39:13] <shoky> 			this.element[0].style.position = 'relative';
[15:39:28] <ParadoxQuine> hmm
[15:39:44] <shoky> that regex makes sure that the position wasn't already relative/absolute/fixed
[15:39:56] <shoky> afaict
[15:40:16] <ParadoxQuine> well i dont have that in, and it is already specified...in my fiddle its not adding position: relative
[15:40:40] <ParadoxQuine> i wonder if its a weird issue with backbone
[15:41:04] <shoky> shrugs
[15:46:48] <Dr-Bombay> lol you said bone
[15:47:08] <sekyms> I have an array full of objects that I access like this enharmonic[i] if I want to access part of the obect I do this enharmonic[randomNote].isRoot.  How do I do the later when I have the "isRoot" part in  a variable?
[15:48:02] <Dr-Bombay> what does "randomNote" have to do with "accessing part of the object"
[15:48:04] <ajpiano> sekyms: enharmonic[randomNote][isRoot]
[15:48:12] <Dr-Bombay> oh, that
[15:48:32] <sekyms> no dot?
[15:48:40] <ajpiano> yep
[15:48:58] <ajpiano> the syntax for accessing a property using a dynamic key doesn't change just because it's more nested
[15:49:06] <ajpiano> foo[bar] .... foo[bar][baz] etc
[15:49:31] <sekyms> you sir are a brilliant person
[15:50:26] <ajpiano> next time ask the question and maybe i will be here and maybe i won't :p
[15:50:42] <shoky> with brilliant hair
[15:50:46] <sekyms> its weird because i alsoacces it this way
[15:50:46] <sekyms> enharmonic[randomNote].isRoot;
[15:50:51] <sekyms> brilliant ginger hair
[15:51:39] <shoky> sekyms what are you working on
[15:51:44] <ajpiano> sekyms: you could also do enharmonic[randomNote]["isRoot"]
[15:51:58] <ajpiano> the point is
[15:52:03] <ajpiano> you don't use a dot when you use brackets
[15:52:03] <sekyms> I am working on a music game in my free time
[15:52:22] <shoky> sounds fun
[15:52:36] <ajpiano> that was apparent from the var names :p
[15:52:44] <sekyms> i was a music teacher before i started with the designer gig
[15:53:03] <shoky> nice
[15:53:12] <sekyms> I'm using this js library for displaying notes using canvas
[15:53:25] <shoky> i mostly divide my time between coding and jazz
[15:53:37] <ajpiano> ah, i was a music student before i started with this programming thing :p
[15:53:40] <sekyms> i don't play anymore i burned out
[15:53:48] <sekyms> but i know my jazz
[15:53:58] <tw2113> i was a student once
[15:55:17] <shoky> ajpiano find some time for it ;\
[15:55:26] <sekyms> ajpiano: i think i remember you saying that
[15:55:28] <shoky> you owe it to your nick
[15:55:43] <sekyms> he owes no one anything
[15:55:51] <sekyms> if he doesn't want to play anymore he doesn't have to
[15:56:16] <ajpiano> haha i just said it as a poetic rejoinder to his point of having been a teacher
[15:56:28] <ajpiano> i made this nick up when i was 9 so i have put in my time lol
[15:56:40] <sekyms> my nick is almost that old
[15:57:58] <tw2113> ah, i think my brain just connected ajpiano's nick
[15:58:04] <tw2113> first and middle initial + instrument
[15:58:14] <ajpiano> heh yep
[15:58:20] <ajpiano> welcome to the mind of a 9 year old on aol in 1995
[15:58:26] <sekyms> yeah i just made that conclusion too
[15:58:33] <shoky> i think that was the first thing i noticed about Him
[15:58:34] <sekyms> ajpiano: i was 11 on aol
[15:58:38] <tw2113> mine is still based off of NBA basketball
[15:58:39] <ajpiano> haha
[15:58:43] <sekyms> that porn bled across on a 2400 modem
[15:58:46] <ajpiano> tw2113: nba jam te?
[15:58:57] <tw2113> nah, just Minnesota Timberwolves
[15:59:08] <tw2113> "tw" and then Garnett's old number when he was still in MN
[15:59:09] <ajpiano> ah
[15:59:11] <tw2113> + 13
[15:59:13] <ajpiano> ah
[15:59:23] <ajpiano> my alternative nick then was "WdRcvr85"
[16:00:01] <sekyms> ajpiano: are you flordian born and raised?
[16:00:09] <ajpiano> sekyms: no, new york born and raise
[16:00:19] <sekyms> aren't you FL now?
[16:00:21] <ajpiano> don't know why you keep thinkin  i'm in fl
[16:00:22] <ajpiano> no
[16:00:27] <sekyms> no idea
[16:00:35] <sekyms> which borrough
[16:00:40] <ajpiano> manhatan
[16:00:49] <ajpiano> i was born on li tho
[16:01:00] <tw2113> according to early yayquery, he was in Texas at the time?
[16:01:12] <tw2113> or am i thinking someone else

[16:05:46] <sekyms> i thought you were head of UI
[16:05:54] <shoky> i think there was a misunderstanding
[16:06:00] <ajpiano> dev rel for ui
[16:06:02] <shoky> he was saying ajpiano does jquery ui
[16:06:29] <ajpiano> oh i misread that lol

[16:24:12] <invalidopcode> Anyone with jquery-mobile on heroku experience? Because a page that works fine on my local machine doesn't work when loaded on heroku. The source that firefox receives seems to be correct, but the page just shows a spinning loading screen. Any suggestions?
[16:45:22] <mansour> I am not a skilled js programmer, but there is something I don't understand about ajax callback function 'The Parameters'. Some times, there is one, or two, or three, and diffrent names !!
[16:45:52] <mansour> how do I know what name to use, and how many argument I can pass to the call back ??
[16:46:03] <systemfault> mansour: Do you have an example?
[16:46:55] <mansour> systemfault: in this example there are three for the success function, and for the error, but with different names. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5004233/jquery-ajax-post-request-for-an-example
[16:47:46] <mansour> in this example, there is only one http://stackoverflow.com/questions/377644/jquery-ajax-error-handling-show-custom-exception-messages
[16:47:56] <mansour> !!!
[16:48:25] <systemfault> mansour: There's always 3 for that success callback
[16:48:55] <systemfault> mansour: In the second example, they simply omit the two other arguments because he doesn't need them
[16:49:20] <mansour> scroll down on the second page, you will see     success: function (data, text) {
[16:49:43] <mansour> systemfault: what about the naming ?
[16:49:52] <systemfault> mansour: You can name the parameters the way you want
[16:50:13] <mansour> ok, but what matters is the order, I guess.
[16:50:18] <systemfault> Exactly
[16:50:45] <mansour> ok, so what are the 3 arguments for success and for error ?
[16:50:48] <systemfault> Because it's the jquery library that "calls" your callback function with the parameters in a specific order
[16:51:38] <systemfault> Look at the documentation, I usually only use the first one…. and I use the new "promise" interface.
[16:51:42] <mansour> systemfault: and how can I get the text generated from the response ?
[16:51:55] <systemfault> mansour: Should be the first parameter
[16:52:12] <mansour> coool
[16:52:17] <systemfault> mansour: Depending on the dataType field in the ajax configuration object, it might change.
[16:52:43] <mansour> I am looking at this success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)Function, Array on page http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:52:58] <mansour> not sure how up to date this is.
[16:53:05] <mansour> but it gave me an idea
[16:53:12] <systemfault> $.ajax(configurationhere).done(function(response) { useResponseHere }).fail(function() {});    is the new "cool way"
[16:53:41] <mansour> yep,
[16:53:56] <mansour> thank you.
[16:56:12] <mansour> I get [Object Object] for the response !!
[17:03:08] <raj> mansour, missed your quesation
[17:03:11] <raj> *question
[17:04:30] <systemfault> mansour: alert is useless… use console.log + dev tools on chrome or firefox :/
[17:05:08] <mansour> raj, systemfault: I got it working. thank you all.
[17:05:14] <raj> or firebug lite in IE
[17:05:15] <systemfault> :)
[17:05:41] <systemfault> If you develop on IE… you're stupid.
[17:06:05] <beancurd> or a genious!
[17:06:10] <beancurd> GENIOUS.
[17:06:19] <beancurd> guis.. i think this guy is onto something.
[17:07:32] <mansour> systemfault: no, I am developing on gentoo. so there is traces of IE at all.
[17:07:34] <mansour> ;)
[17:07:45] <systemfault> Wonderful :P
[17:07:59] <beancurd> i miss linux :(
[17:08:04] <shoky> raj, me goin to sleep
[17:08:07] <systemfault> I would switch to Arch if I were you :P
[17:08:08] <beancurd> <- asp.net T_T
[17:08:15] <Klevre> I have a menu that opens up when I click a div, how do I hide it when any other element or blank part of the page is clicked?
[17:08:16] <beancurd> sudo pacman -Syu
[17:08:22] <raj> goodnight shoky
[17:08:24] <systemfault> Gentoo is a joke :#
[17:08:24] <beancurd> *BREAK ALL THE THINGS :D
[17:08:28] <systemfault> :'(
[17:08:32] <raj> thanks for all the help :)
[17:08:50] <shoky> np :) let me know tomorrow if you still need smth
[17:08:54] <shoky> gnight
[17:09:04] <evenix> hi all
[17:10:56] <beancurd> Klevre: i'm guessing something along the lines of .not('#div-to-click).click()
[17:11:05] <mansour> systemfault: as long as I can get the work done, no matter what distro, I use. :)
[17:11:17] <systemfault> Right :)
[17:11:27] <beancurd> win3.1
[17:11:33] <mansour> beancurd: LOOOL
[17:11:35] <mansour> yeah
[17:11:41] <Klevre> beancurd, apparently from some examples it seems like I have to hook the click function of body or html element
[17:12:38] <beancurd> Klevre: i was thinking that, but your target div is within body/html as well?
[17:12:55] <Klevre> beancurd, yes
[17:13:06] <beancurd> try it anyway. if you've gotten this far, the rest sohuld be easy.
[17:13:42] <beancurd> worse case, you break it, then you show us, and someone here unbreaks it.
[17:14:32] <ekkis> afternoon everyone.  I've copy/pasted the code from the jquery-ui tabs page into a page of my own and can't make it work.  could anyone point out the error of my ways?  http://jsfiddle.net/xnRd5/
[17:16:30] <ekkis> it's really straightforward.  I don't get what I'm missing
[17:16:53] <beancurd> css.
[17:17:02] <ekkis> I need css??
[17:17:11] <ekkis> the demo doesn't seem to include any
[17:17:37] <beancurd> i'll have a look.
[17:17:39] <ekkis> when I say "the demo" I mean: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[17:17:49] <ekkis> that is where I took the code from
[17:18:15] <InphraRed> hi
[17:18:17] <beancurd> kk.
[17:21:33] <InphraRed> I'm having a wierd problem with loops and callback function of .slideUp.  If I unroll the loop, make them a string of if statements then everything works, if I loop my .slideUp animations then they don't actually slideUp but instantly disappear.
[17:23:58] <Sutffness> ekkis, it is the css
[17:24:36] <ekkis> Sutffness: I'm implementing a ThemeRoller thing...
[17:24:48] <ekkis> Sutffness: I'm sure you're right
[17:25:23] <Sutffness> ekkis, the script just changes class names
[17:25:29] <beancurd> ekkis: it's the css, the js is working fine.
[17:25:31] <beancurd> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/default.html
[17:25:33] <ekkis> ah, I see
[17:25:42] <beancurd> take a look at that to see which css files you need to inc.
[17:26:09] <Sutffness> http://jsfiddle.net/xnRd5/5/ here, I just added the jquery ui css and nothing more
[17:26:12] <ekkis> yes, I see... it works fine at that location
[17:26:13] <InphraRed> can someone help with the .slideUp function? :)
[17:27:10] <ekkis> Sutffness, beancurd: thanks guys.  that's my issue
[17:27:23] <coldhead> that's what HE said
[17:27:42] <coldhead> little bible joke there
[17:27:56] <ekkis> oh you didn't mean He
[17:28:03] <ekkis> :)
[17:30:32] <Joan> How do I select the text within an element within an ID? I have <li id="pt-mytalk"><a href="http://google.com/" title="hello there" accesskey="n">This text</a></li>
[17:30:40] <Joan> I want to change "This text" to "That text".
[17:30:59] <Joan> $("li#pt-mytalk").text() and $("li#pt-mytalk").html() seem to kill the link.
[17:31:58] <ekkis> Joan: kill the link?
[17:32:04] <Dr-Bombay> $('#pt-mytalk a').text()
[17:32:08] <coldhead> Joan: if you're changint the text of a link you need to select the link
[17:32:15] <coldhead> Dr-Bombay++
[17:32:43] <Joan> Dr-Bombay: Oh, beautiful. Thanks. :-)
[17:32:50] <Joan> That was easy.™
[17:35:53] <mansour> when using the error function in ajax, error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) I need to read a message from the server with the error !!

[17:37:39] <Hopsy> coldhead: are you readdy for queensday?

[17:40:29] <Dr-Bombay> mansour: you should be able to get response details from the jqxhr object  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[17:40:46] <mansour> Dr-Bombay: thank you. will check it
[17:41:20] <Hopsy> If I have a good sleep I will coldhead :p
[17:41:33] <Wilornel> Idk if this shoulb be asked here, but I wanted to know, how can I save some data related to a certain element without using stuff like id and rel
[17:41:45] <coldhead> warm milk, Hopsy
[17:41:51] <Hopsy> coldhead: are you familiar with data recovery?
[17:41:52] <coldhead> and a pint of cognac
[17:41:57] <mansour> ok, but then I have to manually parse the json. Right ?
[17:42:14] <coldhead> not really, Hopsy, i hate hardware
[17:42:16] <coldhead> and data
[17:42:36] <wkmanire> mansour: Manually parse JSON? It's already parsed. It's JSON.
[17:42:42] <Hopsy> I am now asked nearly whole freenode
[17:42:53] <coldhead> Wilornel: surely you can just pick the bits you want to "save" and ignore the others?
[17:43:07] <coldhead> lost some data Hopsy ?
[17:43:08] <Hopsy> my notebook crashed since january
[17:43:13] <Wilornel> coldhead: I know what I want to keep and what not to...
[17:43:32] <Hopsy> lost some notes for school :(
[17:43:44] <Wilornel> What I do, to save data is this
[17:43:45] <Wilornel> :
[17:43:59] <ekkis> Wilornel: if you don't use id or rel, what do you use?
[17:44:01] <mansour> when I get back jqXHR object, I can access the text usting jqXHR.responseText
[17:44:08] <mansour> this is text and not JSON.
[17:44:17] <mansour> right ??
[17:44:27] <Wilornel> <img id=' +someId +' class=' +someInfo +' rel=' +someOtherInfo +' src='asd.png' />
[17:44:50] <Wilornel> thats what I do
[17:44:57] <ekkis> Wilornel: ok... so what's the question then?
[17:45:05] <ekkis> what does it mean to save?
[17:45:07] <Wilornel> Is there any other way to store data?
[17:45:14] <Wilornel> data related to this element?
[17:45:19] <Wilornel> cuz what i do is that:
[17:45:47] <Wilornel> $('#id').click(function(){ info1 = this.rel; }
[17:45:55] <wkmanire> mansour: Set dataType to "json" for you ajax call.
[17:46:09] <Hopsy> coldhead: did you finished your cool latin schoolprogram :p
[17:46:31] <lazyPower> Question about triggers: I'm trying to fire an embed based on when a containers css class changes. Is this something that needs to be wired up to speak?
[17:46:44] <lazyPower> or do i just pass in the selector reference i'm looking for and jquery will handle it for me? Because that didn't work.
[17:46:56] <Hopsy> ?trigger
[17:47:15] <Dr-Bombay> wk: he's dealing with the error case. json is parsed only for a successful response
[17:47:19] <Wilornel> ekkis?
[17:47:34] <Dr-Bombay> anyway, jquery 1.4.1 and later has a function for parsing json
[17:47:51] <Hopsy> ?trigger
[17:47:51] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[17:48:20] <coldhead> Hopsy: i don't think there is any more latin development since you last saw it
[17:48:41] <wkmanire> Dr-Bombay: Ah, ok.
[17:48:47] <coldhead> Hopsy: i believe there are some special linux distros that will let you boot off a CD and try to recover data from a hard drive
[17:48:56] <coldhead> never used one but i'd try that
[17:49:53] <mansour> wkmanire: that didn't work.
[17:50:04] <wkmanire> mansour: Did you see what Dr-Bombay said?
[17:50:36] <wkmanire> mansour: Look at jquery.parseJSON. He said jquery doesn't evaluate text as JSON for error responses from the server.
[17:50:49] <Hopsy> I tried those tools: spinrite, testdisk, hdd recognition, photorec
[17:51:05] <mansour> ok, thank you all.
[17:51:11] <Hopsy> I have tried to mount under ubuntu
[17:51:13] <mansour> I will try this. I just saw it.
[17:51:19] <Hopsy> but this wasnt possible
[17:51:50] <Hopsy> so I couldnt even do a fdisk etc.
[17:52:40] <invalidopcode> good evening
[17:52:51] <coldhead> Hopsy: if it's really important you can take it to some professionals
[17:52:56] <coldhead> and pay them to recover
[17:54:02] <Hopsy> coldhead: yeah, I have seen the prices =[
[17:54:24] <Hopsy> 70 euro for diagnose
[17:54:29] <Hopsy> diagnosis
[17:54:45] <coldhead> i see why you're trying to do it yourself
[17:54:45] <Hopsy> 300 euro for data recovery
[17:54:50] <coldhead> but if you can't do it :(
[17:55:12] <Hopsy> there should be a way!
[17:55:14] <coldhead> maybe they will do it for free if you tell them they can keep a copy of whatever you find?
[17:55:24] <coldhead> if there's anything good for them to find
[17:55:24] <Hopsy> I wont quit easyly :p
[17:55:32] <coldhead> hahahah that's the spirit!
[17:56:17] <Hopsy> I have read the SMART data, only the partitions are not ok
[17:58:22] <coldhead> Hopsy: i am being told you should check out "freezer" and "testdisk"
[17:58:48] <coldhead> Hopsy: did you try strings /dev/sda1 or whatever?
[17:58:59] <Hopsy> yes
[17:59:07] <Hopsy> I tried to mount that file
[17:59:22] <Hopsy> gave some error
[17:59:48] <Hopsy> hmm, I never heard of freezer
[17:59:55] <coldhead> strings should ignore the partition stuff and let you read the raw data
[18:00:19] <Hopsy> ow its a function
[18:00:21] <Hopsy> hmm
[18:01:30] <Hopsy> I am now on windows, so I wrote this down. I will test it tomorow
[18:02:29] <ekkis> Wilornel: sorry, I had to run out and make sure the kids don't break anything
[18:02:40] <invalidopcode> I'm having a problem with jQuery mobile... it seems that when running this code http://jsfiddle.net/fAbaA/5/ on heroku, it just shows a spinning loading screen
[18:04:08] <ekkis> Wilornel: so I take it that info1 is some variable and thus you're "saving" the value .rel?
[18:04:14] <mansour> wkmanire, Dr-Bombay: thank you it worked
[18:05:00] <Hopsy> coldhead: I am going to bed, I will try that tomorow, thanks!
[18:05:10] <coldhead> good luck Hopsy !
[18:05:15] <coldhead> happy queensday
[18:05:20] <coldhead> say hi to beatrix for us
[18:05:22] <Hopsy> thank you :p
[18:05:31] <Hopsy> I will do that!
[18:06:07] <Hopsy> I will tell her my australian friend did greet her
[18:06:18] <coldhead> thank you
[18:06:24] <wkmanire> mansour: :)
[18:06:24] <Hopsy> haha
[18:15:54] <invalidopcode> does anyone have a little bit of free time to help me out?
[18:17:59] <evenix> Hey guys I need help with this: https://gist.github.com/2516758  when the content is being rendered once by an ajax pagination effect,  the jquery show/hide div for the comment button is not working. For a live example here the test website: http://blazing-stream-7978.herokuapp.com/
[18:18:49] <evenix> I believe that when it is being 'rendered' the 'script' that allows the show/hide div is not being applied to the content rendered
[18:19:23] <wkmanire> invalidopcode: What is your question?
[18:20:00] <Third3ye> Hello there :) severe case of jquery and ajvascript n00bery going on here -- I'd rather show you what I'm trying to do...
[18:20:18] <Third3ye> http://pastebin.com/fPLQDws5 <-Added some comments... wrote the code just to try and visualize my self out of the problem...
[18:20:23] <ekkis> evenix: I've struggled with that kinda shite in the past.  let me look...
[18:20:36] <invalidopcode> wkmanire: this code: http://jsfiddle.net/fAbaA/7/ runs find locally, but for some reason when it's hosted from heroku, it just sits there with a spinning loading thing
[18:21:06] <invalidopcode> its like it gets stuck rendering or something
[18:21:39] <evenix> ekkis:  thanks
[18:21:53] <wkmanire> invalidopcode: What is the response code from the server?
[18:22:16] <evenix> i would really love to understand that issue so that it never happen again
[18:23:24] <Third3ye> i'm trying to make a generic hover menu that adds "_hvr" before the file extension on hover and removes it when hovering away
[18:24:09] <invalidopcode> wkmanire: would that be what shows up in "view source" in firefox on the page or the stuff in the HTML tab in firebird?
[18:24:30] <wkmanire> invalidopcode: That would be the HTTP status code returned by the server you're POSTing to.
[18:25:22] <wkmanire> evenix: If you are replacing markup you've bound events to and you want the same events to fire for the new content you've loaded you might want to consider using .live() to bind the events to selectors instead of directly to the elements.
[18:25:25] <wkmanire> evenix: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[18:25:57] <invalidopcode> ohhh that code.. its not the form POST thats the problem... its getting the whole form to render... or is there some POST that I'm missing there?
[18:26:01] <evenix> wkmanire: ok thanks about ot check that out
[18:26:49] <Third3ye> can I use the file extension in a src attribute as a selector? i.e $(".png").prepend({"_hvr"});
[18:26:57] <wkmanire> invalidopcode: You said that it just spins forever without completing. The first thing I would check is that the server is actually responding and it is responding with the expected status code.
[18:27:36] <evenix> wkmanire: As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live().
[18:28:21] <tomster2300> hey everyone
[18:28:25] <wkmanire> Third3ye: $("[src$=.png]") will get those elements. If you want to modify the attribute you need to use .attr(), not prepend.
[18:28:26] <invalidopcode> wkmanire: im a little confused now.. when you first navigate to the page, it spins forever before you can even see anything.
[18:28:27] <austinallen> hello
[18:28:36] <tomster2300> hello
[18:28:45] <austinallen> So Whats up Guys
[18:28:45] <Third3ye> wkmanire: I want to add _hvr before .png on hover and remove it again after hover
[18:29:03] <wkmanire> evenix: Ah, it's been a while since I've worked with jQuery. The same functionality can probably be achieved with .on(). I'll verify.
[18:29:18] <invalidopcode> wkmanire: and watching the net traffic on firebird, there aren't any POSTs issued
[18:29:45] <wkmanire> invalidopcode: Then you need to start there. Either your request is not right or there is a problem with the server.
[18:30:40] <invalidopcode> wkmanire: what post should it be making when it first loads?
[18:31:13] <tomster2300> i need some help.  I'm iterating a JSON array with $.each and have assigned the values i want to a variable.  I'm confused though on how to return that variable outside of the local scope so i can use it in other functions
[18:32:29] <invalidopcode> wkmanire: what's weird is that firefox GETs the right code, but there is some ui-loader stuff added to it
[18:32:33] <wkmanire> evenix: Yep. Looks like you should be using .on(). Read the "Direct and delegated events" section carefully.
[18:32:44] <evenix> wkmanire: ok thanks
[18:32:52] * invalidopcode will be back in about an hour
[18:33:49] <Third3ye> wkmanire: I want it to be automated so that if I add another menu item the script will automatically accomodate it... I would be happy if I could just recieve a little pointer in the right direction :)
[18:34:14] <tomster2300> can anyone help me out with my question? i'm not the best at javascript or jquery, and this is driving me nuts
[18:34:20] <InphraRed> I'm having some problems with .slideUp can anyone help out please?  basically if I put .slideUp within a loop where the callback is making some calls, the .slideUp effect doesn't work but if I unroll the loop and have a sequence of if statements, everything works fine.
[18:34:33] <wkmanire> Third3ye: Read about .on() and .attr().
[18:34:45] <Third3ye> Will do :)
[18:35:09] <InphraRed> Third3ye I used to run Third Eye irc scripts... for original epic I think it was.
[18:35:12] <wkmanire> Third3ye: That selector I showed you says "Get me all elements that have a src attribute that ends with .png.
[18:35:13] <bot-t> InphraRed, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:35:46] <Third3ye> wkmanire: I figured as much ^^;; already have that in the form of $(this), as it refers to $("#menu img")
[18:35:51] <tomster2300> would it help if i made a working demo for my issue?
[18:35:58] <InphraRed> bot-t ok
[18:37:48] <tomster2300> i need some help.  I'm iterating a JSON array with $.each and have assigned the values i want to a variable.  I'm confused though on how to return that variable outside of the local scope so i can use it in other functions
[18:37:59] <Third3ye> InphraRed: Well I assure you that I'm not a script ERROR_294{ %_SMILEY_MISSING% }
[18:41:45] <evenix> wkmanire: "you might want to consider using .live() to bind the events to selectors instead of directly to the elements." can you explain this?
[18:41:59] <wkmanire> evenix: Yeah, I gave some outdated advice.
[18:42:13] <enigmabomb> Hello guys. Can any of you help me understand why the map on this page does not work: http://myauntishot.com/josh/frontcopy.html but the map on this page works? http://myauntishot.com/clickablemap/html/index.html
[18:42:14] <wkmanire> evenix: You can bind a delegated event with .on().
[18:42:53] <enigmabomb> The resources are all there, and the code is correct. It's totally screwing with my head.
[18:43:02] <wkmanire> evenix: What live does/did is fire callbacks for any element that matches the given selector that fires the bound event.
[18:43:16] <wkmanire> evenix: It was a good solution for dealing with ajax based pagination for example.
[18:43:27] <evenix> wkmanire: so i should suround that code with a .on() call ?
[18:44:14] <wkmanire> evenix: But there was a lot of redundancy between .bind(), all of the event functions like .click(), .mouseover() etc... and .delegate()
[18:44:21] <wkmanire> Looks like they cleaned that all up with .on() and .off()
[18:44:47] <wkmanire> evenix: I'm not sure what you mean by "surround code".
[18:46:46] <enigmabomb> What would cause a function to not be recognized even if all the resources are loading? jQuery(".map").maphilight is not a function is giving me trouble on http://myauntishot.com/josh/frontcopy.html
[18:48:25] <wkmanire> enigmabomb: You could be loading your scripts out of order. You could have variable conflicts, where one script is overriding variables in other.
[18:49:00] <enigmabomb> wkmanire: Interesting. I didn't know that order of loading was an important factor. I have it working in this order on another page. Could Doctype screw this up?
[18:49:37] <wkmanire> enigmabomb: No, not really. Scripts are interpreted in the order they appear in the document, top down, one at a time.
[18:50:35] <enigmabomb> wkanmire: I've isolated the problem to not being the order, or the over riding issue you talked about.
[18:51:08] <enigmabomb> wkmanire: It works famously in that order, on this page. http://myauntishot.com/clickablemap/html/index.html
[18:51:17] <evenix> wkmanire: I am fairly new with jquery.. I take the time to go trhought the documentation but I there are still some details I havent mastered yet. By suround. I meant using $(document).on('click', '#micropost', function{ ... });  instead of  $(document).ready.(function(){
[18:51:23] <danzik17> enigmabomb: fyi, you're loading jquery twice.  1.2.3, then 1.6.4.  why?
[18:51:31] <evenix> since I want that to be live and happend even after the page is loaded
[18:51:55] <enigmabomb> danzik17: This code was included with the map. Where is it loading the second version of JQuery?
[18:52:38] <wkmanire> evenix: Did you study javascript before you started using jQuery?
[18:52:39] <enigmabomb> danzik17: I show one load, the first script object, 1.2.3
[18:52:56] <danzik17> enigmabomb: and one at the bottom of the page, 1.6.4.
[18:53:16] <evenix> wkmanire: no.. sorry i think i just got it  $(".show_hide" + value).show().click(function () { is the part where i need to add the on() call isnt it?
[18:53:28] <enigmabomb> danzik17: Good catch. didn't even see that. I didn't know you could load query in the footer.
[18:53:28] <evenix> wkmanire: i went striaght to jquerry and read tutorials about it online
[18:53:45] <enigmabomb> danzik17: I'll try commenting that out and see what happens
[18:54:12] <danzik17> enigmabomb: no, replace the earlier one - don't use 1.2.3.  that's just crazy old, and you're going to have problems
[18:54:19] <danzik17> use the latest version for new projects.
[18:54:31] <enigmabomb> danzik17: Ok, great, let me try that
[18:54:59] <wkmanire> evenix: jQuery is a javascript library. Take some time to learn javascript. Not only will you appreciate more of what jQuery does for you, but you'll remove all of these uncetainties about the way your code works.
[18:55:17] <enigmabomb> danzik17: It works! Thank you for the keen eye. I went over that page 300 times, but apparently never made it to the footer.
[18:55:23] <wkmanire> uncertanties*
[18:55:48] <InphraRed> how do I include the jquery script in jsfiddle.net?
[18:56:58] <InphraRed> it's not working at jsfiddle.net but it is in my browser here.... (cut and paste)... I'm not familiar with jsfiddle.net
[18:58:01] <evenix> wkmanire: ok thanks. I defintiely plan to get deeper in javascript and read about it to take a bettter advantage of a browser language.
[18:58:55] <evenix> its on my list of must do. .. right now i am just trying to fix this bug  so that i can launch the website new update before tomorrow.
[18:59:01] <evenix> then ill have time to focus on learning more about javascript
[19:00:08] <InphraRed> who advised me to use jsfiddle?
[19:00:44] <Third3ye> InphraRed: I think it's simply a matter of chosing which version of jquery you want to use
[19:00:53] <InphraRed> Third3ye I did
[19:01:12] <InphraRed> the javascript calls aren't making it through.... alert("foo"); doesn't pop up
[19:01:26] <Third3ye> hmm... strange
[19:01:55] <InphraRed> I don't know, I never used jsfiddle.  I tried wrapping up all the java code in <script> stuff and it went ape shit about that.
[19:02:06] <InphraRed> so I suppose I just put javascript code in the javascript window.
[19:02:52] <InphraRed>  <a id="lin" href="#" onClick="switchFeatures(0);">Links</a>   <- it never calls switchFeatures from the javascript window, the only thing switchFeatures does is pop up the alert box
[19:04:04] <Third3ye> wkmanire: I haven't for the life of me been able to figure out a method to simply add _hvr before .png in an attribute... read the on and attr page -- I get how I'm supposed to use them, but not how to combine... it should be noted I have little to no JS experience...
[19:05:18] <Third3ye> Found a script here, that does the trick... http://www.yart.com.au/Resources/jQuery/jQuery---Auto-replace-image-on-hover.aspx
[19:05:18] <InphraRed> jesus christ, now I need help with using jsfiddle
[19:05:51] <InphraRed> the HTML pane is apparently disconnected from the javascript pane
[19:06:40] <wkmanire> Third3ye: First write a function that takes a string and toggles whether the string starts with _hvr or not.
[19:06:57] <wkmanire> Then use a selector to bind that function to mouseover and mouseout.
[19:08:19] <wkmanire> Third3ye: Give me a sec. I'll set up a fiddle to show you what I mean.
[19:08:30] <InphraRed> wkmanire can you help me with fiddle?
[19:09:02] * wkmanire can only do one thing a time until his mutation completes.
[19:10:00] <Third3ye> "Moar arms... moar legs... MOAR EVERYTHING...!"
[19:11:32] <LazyTown> do I have access to "$(this)" when binding an even with ".on()"
[19:11:54] <InphraRed> I just need to have jsfiddle know how to include the java from the javascript pane with the HTML pane
[19:16:55] <evenix> wkmanire: i think one thing i didnt really uderstand was where the on() need to be added.. to the pagination part of the code? or to the show/hide part of the code?  '. If new HTML is being injected into the page, select the elements and attach event handlers after the new HTML is placed into the page.' led me to think that i should add it to the pagination code
[19:17:31] <wkmanire> Third3ye: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/DbT2y/
[19:17:36] <wkmanire> Take a look.
[19:17:51] <InphraRed> I'm having some problems with .slideUp can anyone help out please?  basically if I put .slideUp within a loop where the callback is making some calls, the .slideUp effect doesn't work but if I unroll the loop and have a sequence of if statements, everything works fine.
[19:18:00] <wkmanire> This could be further improved by writing a single call back function that is used in both bindings.
[19:18:54] <InphraRed> wkmanire how did you get the HTML ahd Javascript working together?
[19:19:36] <wkmanire> Third3ye: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/DbT2y/1/ better version. although keep in mind that those two functions are hanging out in the global scope which is bad.
[19:19:53] <wkmanire> InphraRed: What?
[19:20:40] <InphraRed> how did you get the HTML and javascript working together in jsfiddle.
[19:20:41] <wkmanire> InphraRed: That doesn't even any sense.
[19:21:00] <InphraRed> wkmanire what doesn't make sense?
[19:21:08] <wkmanire> InphraRed: Your question.
[19:21:20] <wkmanire> InphraRed: What do you mean by work together?
[19:21:52] <InphraRed> I put html in the html pane, javascript in the javascript pane... it doens't work.
[19:21:56] <wkmanire> Third3ye: Did you get that code?
[19:22:10] <wkmanire> InphraRed: Let me see your fiddle.
[19:22:24] <Third3ye> wkmanire: one sec, wrapping my uneducated head around it ^^;;
[19:22:29] <InphraRed> http://jsfiddle.net/9Uc6L/
[19:22:58] <InphraRed> wkmanire I dont' care about fiddle persay, but if you could look at the javascript/jquery where it says "doesn't work"
[19:23:02] <wkmanire> Third3ye: toggle_hvr uses a regular expression literal and a turnary expression.
[19:23:46] <wkmanire> Third3ye: The toggle_hvrMouseEvent sets the .attr to contain the value returned by toggle_hvr.
[19:24:02] <wkmanire> InphraRed: Looking
[19:24:28] <Third3ye> wkmanire: here is some code I copy-pasted and modified, which works.. but it isn't as nicely written as your code :> SO I'm still reading it and trying to figure out the actual process of it...
[19:24:32] <Third3ye> http://jsfiddle.net/wCtXD/
[19:24:36] <wkmanire> InphraRed: WHy are you using document.getElementById and also loading jQuery?
[19:25:01] <InphraRed> wkmanire never used jquery before, only using it to do the slide fx
[19:25:15] <InphraRed> didn't know there were API in jquery to get IDs, but that's no matter really
[19:26:35] <InphraRed> when I unroll the loop, the incoming div slidesdown while the previous div slidesup, very nice rolling effect.  but when I have it in the loop, the slideup is instant so the effect is only one div sliding down.
[19:27:05] <wkmanire> InphraRed: Sorry dude. Not going to help you until you read the jQuery documentation. IF you need help with javascript go to the #javsacript channel.
[19:27:19] <InphraRed> wkmanire it is with jquery
[19:27:28] <InphraRed> wkmanire my question is with jquery not javascript
[19:28:02] <Third3ye> InphraRed: But Jquery requires a modacum of javascript knowledge ^^; I think me and you should prolly pick up a javascript tutorial... if I have time :P just doing some design work ^^;
[19:28:44] <InphraRed> modicum, and I have enough javascript knowledge.  just because I'm not using all jquery api doesn't mean I don't know javascript
[19:29:36] <wkmanire> InphraRed: You're using document.getElementById and the jQuery I selector within one line of eachother. Also, does this fiddle do anything at all?
[19:29:50] <wkmanire> ID selector*
[19:30:57] <InphraRed> wkmanire can you focus on the questio please?  I'm only using jquery for the slider effect, I read the whole page on jquery's site regarding slideup and slidedown.
[19:31:25] <InphraRed> wkmanire, I promise, I'll go and change the getElementById if that makes you happy.
[19:32:32] <Gates> is there a way to use jquery to read a magazine?
[19:33:19] <wkmanire> InphraRed: Not really about making me happy or about you exclusively using jQuery. I'm just confused by the choices that were made here. I'll read your code. One minute.
[19:33:37] <InphraRed> wkmanire yes it does, but that's a different question on how to get the HTML pane to work with the Javascript pane in jsfiddle, I never used jsfiddle either.  but that code works in any browser.
[19:33:58] <Third3ye> InphraRed: http://www.troll.me/2012/04/29/neil-degrasse/woa-watch-out-now-we-got-us-a-spellchecker/
[19:34:07] <Third3ye> Maybe that'll help
[19:34:23] <InphraRed> Third3ye ok...
[19:35:30] <beancurd> what's going on...
[19:35:36] <beancurd> now now children..
[19:35:37] <InphraRed> wkmanire if push comes to shove I'll show you the live site that it's sitting on
[19:35:57] <Third3ye> Ah DeGrasse ^^ You seizty devil you
[19:39:08] <wkmanire> InphraRed: I'm not sure if using javascript event handlers in the attributes is going to work in jsFiddle.
[19:39:31] <wkmanire> In either case, that is a bad idea and jQuery can attach that event handler for you.
[19:39:42] <wkmanire> Or you could do it without jQuery just as easily.
[19:39:46] <InphraRed> that's awesome
[19:40:06] <InphraRed> I saw something about that in jquery, attaching an event hander to a tag
[19:40:43] <wkmanire> Clean the event handlers out of your markup, then after the document loads attach your switchFeature function the click event handler.
[19:40:50] <wkmanire> event callback I should say.
[19:41:06] <InphraRed> wkmanire ok, that sounds good but I don't think that changes the problem
[19:41:24] <InphraRed> if I do the slideup within the loop (the commented out portion) then it doesn't animate
[19:41:29] <InphraRed> that's the real question
[19:42:00] <wkmanire> InphraRed: I can't even begin to debug this until you get it operating in jsfiddle. I've already tried a few different things. as far as I can tell, this setup is borked.
[19:42:23] <InphraRed> well that's jsfiddle
[19:42:46] <wkmanire> InphraRed: If you look at the jsFiddle options on the left you'll see a drop down that says onLoad by default I think.
[19:43:02] <InphraRed> yeah I see that
[19:43:03] <wkmanire> That is telling you where jsFiddle sticks your code in the markup of the run frame.
[19:43:21] <wkmanire> onLoad means it is sticking all of your code into a function that runs after the DOM finishes loading.
[19:43:30] <InphraRed> ok change it to 'no wrap (body)
[19:43:33] <InphraRed> then it works
[19:43:44] <wkmanire> That also means that all of your functions probably don't exist anymore after that function returns.
[19:43:46] <InphraRed> I just updated it refresh
[19:44:21] <wkmanire> Alright, I'll take a look.
[19:44:23] <wkmanire> be right back
[19:44:23] <InphraRed> so it's working now, but if you uncomment out the loop and comment out the unrolled loop, you'll see the effect
[19:44:36] <InphraRed> in switchFeatures
[19:46:18] <InphraRed> hrm... I just switch the code, there's not enough divs and content for the effect to be apparent
[19:46:46] <InphraRed> wkmanire I can show you the live site if you want.
[19:47:37] <InphraRed> http://jsfiddle.net/9Uc6L/2/
[19:48:00] <wkmanire> I'm back. Looking now.
[19:48:45] <wkmanire> Alright, I see what you mean.
[19:49:25] <wkmanire> So you want to make all other divs slide up except for the one that was clicked on.
[19:49:38] <InphraRed> yes
[19:49:44] <InphraRed> it works when the loop is unrolled
[19:50:24] <InphraRed> but when you uncomment the loop in the code there, at least on the published site, the slideups happen instantly so half the animation is gone and all the divs just slide down
[19:50:42] <InphraRed> it only happens with the slideups are called from the loop
[19:54:29] <wkmanire> InphraRed: Just a minute, almost done.
[19:54:36] <InphraRed> k
[19:55:03] <InphraRed> brb baby is crying
[19:56:12] <wkmanire> InphraRed: I know how that is. Let me know when you're back. I'm done.
[19:57:45] <Third3ye> wkmanire: for funs sake, what do you think about this? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12585915/Web/html/index.html
[19:58:32] <wkmanire> Third3ye: What am I looking for?
[19:59:08] <beancurd> nunchucks
[19:59:09] <Third3ye> Just the look of it, the visual apperal.. does it appeal to you? ^^;; not even close to being finished though
[19:59:27] <Third3ye> beancurd: Well there is a hidden ninja somewhere there o_o where's hitmonlee
[20:00:12] <wkmanire> Third3ye: The colors are nice, but the header is gigantic.
[20:00:38] <wkmanire> Third3ye: Thats like a 400 pixel header. he he he
[20:00:42] <Third3ye> it's supposed to be... there's gonna be a very special soundcloud player built there, plus some missing graphics that I haven't "crammed in" yet
[20:00:50] <Third3ye> Yessum ^_^
[20:01:00] <InphraRed> Third3ye just my artistic opinion, too many long gradients.  Not sure if the quarter spher balances out that area either.
[20:01:16] <wkmanire> InphraRed: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/9Uc6L/4/
[20:01:21] <wkmanire> This is the first iteration.
[20:01:26] <wkmanire> We can do it better.
[20:01:41] <InphraRed> other than that, it's cool, the colour scheme would look nice as a photographers blog with some photo reals in the background ( it has the look of a negative )
[20:02:19] <Third3ye> It's actually for a hip-hop/reggea/electronica DJ ^^;;
[20:02:44] <InphraRed> wkmanire ah, but the button backgrounds have to change too..
[20:03:23] <wkmanire> InphraRed: Well, that shouldn't be too hard to do.
[20:03:27] <InphraRed> ok
[20:03:34] <Third3ye> Going through his soundcloud playlist I'd rather not show you some of his work ^^;;
[20:03:35] <InphraRed> wkmanire I'll play with this and see about it
[20:03:37] <wkmanire> Do you see why I was so confused by your code?
[20:03:51] <InphraRed> yeah it's all basic javascript
[20:04:40] <wkmanire> You put a whole lot of thought into it, but if you would have spent that same amount of time studying jQuery you could have knocked this out already.
[20:04:58] <wkmanire> Not to mention that less code that solves the same problem is always more better.
[20:05:13] <InphraRed> wkmanire I have no problem with jquery I summoned when I wanted a feature
[20:05:27] <InphraRed> I have no problem leanring what else could be done with it and implementing it.
[20:05:32] <wkmanire> jQuery is a beast. a very large piece of javascript to include in your site. I wouldn't throw it in there just to use one little piece of it.
[20:07:21] <wkmanire> InphraRed: At any rate, I'm going to get back to what I was working on. I'll check the channel periodically. Feel free to ping me if you have any more questions.
[20:07:46] <InphraRed> wkmanire thanks for the help
[20:07:50] <wkmanire> No problem.
[20:08:04] <InphraRed> I'll try it out
[20:08:14] <Third3ye> I intend to use it for several things... incl soundcloud integration, effects and certain functions that I wouldn't be able to write my self since i have little to no js knowledge ^^;
[20:37:14] <tw2113> paul_irish next time i'm in town, we'll have to plan a bit better :D
[20:38:50] <evenix> can anyone help me with this: https://gist.github.com/2555243? i had to convert my code to coffeescript because the pagination was written in coofeescript
[20:42:24] <evenix> actually i just converted the coofeescript
[20:42:25] <evenix> to javascript
[20:42:27] <evenix> that was way faster
[21:18:09] <invalidopcode> is jQuery or jQuery mobile effected by the parameters specified when navigating to a URL? because for some reason I've discovered that my page won't load when I have a certain parameter specified
[21:18:45] <beancurd> jquery mobile looks for #pagename
[21:19:18] <invalidopcode> hm... ok well that's why then
[21:19:30] <invalidopcode> the parameter i specify might have a # in it
[21:20:50] <invalidopcode> is there a way to disable that?
[21:25:22] <MrHacks> OK, #jQuery, I'm trying to convert an XML file to HTML elements, but some of the parent elements are reused as their children. See http://pastebin.com/Krt4FfLM for full details
[21:25:48] <MrHacks> How do I get that to work?
[21:26:10] <MrHacks> xmlParser is tne name of the callback function on success
[21:27:11] <evenix> wkmanire: been working on the same issue all this time and live is not working with it.
[21:39:36] <MrHacks> Anyone still up?
[21:59:32] <evenix> how do you append an html that containt script
[21:59:43] <evenix> that also* containt script
[22:23:48] <anth0ny> for some strange reason, date.getMonth() is returning one less than that actual date (ie. May returns 4): example code: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/20381/
[22:24:07] <anth0ny> any ideas as to why?
[22:25:47] <lkarrys> It is a zero based index of the month
[22:25:51] <beancurd> anth0ny: 0 index
[22:26:06] <beancurd> 0 = jan, 11 = dec
[22:26:28] <anth0ny> ahhh
[22:26:48] <anth0ny> wait, so getMonth() is intended to return 0 on January?
[22:27:15] <lkarrys> yes
[22:27:25] <lkarrys> Check out the documentation on MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getMonth
[22:27:32] <anth0ny> okay, cool, thanks
[22:33:47] <evenix> hey guys
[22:34:22] <evenix> i was able to resolve my issue with the div that wasnt loading after pagination.. for some reason its content wont  load after pagination as well.. its content is a fbocmment box
[22:34:29] <evenix> how do I reload  the div?
[22:53:39] <usg> hello

[23:32:57] <vl1234> am using "this" concept but if not useful
[23:46:39] <Leviathan1> Hi, I am searching for a concept of a "self-learning-list". Means if a user enters a value, it is selectable next time moving in. I am in jquery mobile.
[23:47:19] <Leviathan1> hm, self-learning-selectmenu is a better description
