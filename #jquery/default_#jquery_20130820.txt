[00:15:35] <blandzi> hi, could any1 tell me when it is usefull to use .data? What data should or can be stored in dom attributes?
[00:16:33] <blandzi> I found some dummy examples how to use it but I can't find and interesting use
[00:16:42] <blandzi> usage
[00:17:57] <ravenzz> it is useful when you want to store data into a DOM node for later reuse
[00:18:16] <ravenzz> it can be anything
[00:18:27] <ravenzz> either a pair of key, value or an object
[00:18:41] <ravenzz> ?data @ blandzi
[00:19:06] <ravenzz> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[00:19:44] * Successful is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[01:14:20] <seutje> blandzi: when storing values with $.fn.data, it's not actually attached as an attribute, but instead jQuery keeps an internal reference to them
[01:14:48] <seutje> so you can attach data to dom nodes you can later recover, without actually touching the dom much
[01:15:06] <Cork> well it does actually attach an id to the dom element
[01:15:21] <seutje> yeah, but that's implied
[01:15:41] <Cork> no i meant it created jquery{guid}=uid
[01:15:45] <seutje> storing extra shit doesn't come with an extra hit
[01:15:49] <Cork> and that uid is used as the index in the data cache
[01:15:59] <seutje> uhu
[01:16:27] <Cork> or the guid might be a timestamp
[01:16:30] <Cork> i don't remember
[01:16:47] <seutje> it's a large number, that's all I need to know :P
[01:20:29] <Cork> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/Gkfqk/
[01:22:04] <seutje> Cork: it's also where custom events are stored, right?
[01:22:20] <Cork> i think so
[01:22:30] <Cork> but not really sure there
[01:22:54] <Cork> some of them are separate at least
[01:23:03] <Cork> $.custom.events
[01:23:29] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Gkfqk/2/
[01:23:38] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/Gkfqk/1/ lol
[01:23:47] <boytoy> Can someone help me unhide my page after my Embedly autoembeds are fully loaded using jQuery Embedly's .done? http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/14/edit -- https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery#client
[01:24:29] <Cork> sigh
[01:24:38] <Cork> yay jsbin is broken again...
[01:25:36] <seutje> it is?
[01:25:55] <Cork> ya, it breaks if you don't have localstorage
[01:26:01] <Cork> the devs keeps breaking it
[01:26:15] <Cork> and apparently my fake localstorage extension is... not working :/
[01:26:19] <seutje> lol
[01:26:33] <Cork> need to check that when i get home i guess
[01:26:34] <seutje> boytoy: looks like you need to pass done as a parameter
[01:27:04] <seutje> boytoy: http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/24/edit
[01:27:05] <boytoy> seutje: cool
[01:27:37] <boytoy> oh like that!
[01:27:58] <boytoy> my bad that jsbin has a lot of irrelevant code in it, thought i'd cleaned it up
[01:28:00] <seutje> boytoy: the .done() syntax is only available when using $.embedly.extract
[01:28:25] <seutje> when using $.fn.embedly, the returned object is a jQuery collection, not an embedly instance
[01:28:43] <seutje> ... I think, cba to dig through the sauce
[01:28:53] <boytoy> hehe
[01:29:09] <boytoy> it works perfectly :)
[01:30:24] <boytoy> now what to do if embedly is offline
[01:30:38] * boytoy shoots a whole cup of coffee at once
[02:09:07] <motaka2> how to add events so that they work both in document ready and in ajax load?
[02:14:14] <rohdef> I'm trying to add an element then sub elements to that, like this: $div = $('<div />'); $('#container').append($div); $idv.append('<p>Foo</p>');, but in stead of getting <div><p>Foo</p></div> as I want I get <div /><p>Foo</p>. How should I do this to make it work? (jQuery 1.8.3)
[02:19:37] <seutje> rohdef: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/PQD8P/
[02:21:21] <seutje> motaka2: there's global ajax event handlers, but you'll probably still need some intermediate code cause doc rdy takes different arguments
[02:22:12] <seutje> like var foo = function() { /*do stuff*/}; $(document).ready(foo).ajaxComplete(foo); I guess
[02:24:03] <LLckfan> Hello
[02:24:13] <LLckfan> I have a tablet and everytime I go to an app that needs me to sign in it takes me to a page that cannot be displayed. Is there a way around this
[02:26:17] <gvo> And that's a jquery support question?
[02:26:58] <motaka2> seutje: Thx
[02:27:57] <seutje> "everything's a fucking jQuery issue"â„¢
[02:38:56] <airdem> ["1","Administrator","2","Erdem","3"] is this wrong json?
[02:39:30] <airdem> $.parseJSON() says  unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data
[02:40:20] <airdem> lol
[02:40:25] <airdem> forgot to wrap ' around it ....
[02:53:50] <IvelfanFr> Bonjour
[02:53:59] <monu> hi
[02:54:02] <IvelfanFr> I wanna do a dropdown menu with jquery mobile.
[02:54:11] <monu> do
[02:54:11] <IvelfanFr> I don't find how.
[02:54:34] <monu> google it
[02:54:44] <IvelfanFr> I google it ...
[02:55:08] <IvelfanFr> I make a click event on a button to slideToggle my menu
[02:55:21] <IvelfanFr> On the first page, always works
[02:55:28] <monu> you worked on open graph?
[02:55:45] <IvelfanFr> But when i slide on an other page, the click doesn't work
[02:56:14] <IvelfanFr> monu, No
[02:56:28] <monu> i have a doubt
[02:57:12] <monu> good noon
[03:13:41] <nitram201000> hi all - can anyone tell me how to stop a function running on page load. I only want it to run when a link is clicked. I currently have $('#newsButton').click(MYPAGE.getNews(MYPAGE.newsPage));  but this seems to run the function getNews() on page load not just when the link is clicked.
[03:16:37] <nitram201000> is this channel still active?
[03:18:47] <gvo> nitram201000: Is that click right?
[03:19:19] <nitram201000> hi gvo -yeh, I just want it to run on Click
[03:21:11] <Cork> nitram201000: MYPAGE.getNews(MYPAGE.newsPage) is a function call not a function reference
[03:21:30] <gvo> nitram201000: for a test try to put your function in as a call from an unnamed function, like $('#newsButton').click(function() {MYPAGE.getNews(MYPAGE.newsPage)); });
[03:22:07] <Cork> gvo: you have an extra parenthesis there
[03:22:15] <gvo> I think i have an extra paraen
[03:22:19] <gvo> Cork yes.
[03:23:02] <gvo> maybe he gets the idea anyway.  ;)
[03:23:59] <nitram201000> #gvo, #Cork - oh, thats great - thanks guys -  I will give that a try - didnt know there was a difference between function refenece and fucntion call - many thanks
[03:24:17] <gvo> np
[03:25:38] <nitram201000> #Cork - how would I pass this fucntion as a reference, rather than a fucntion call?
[03:27:01] <Cork> nitram201000: without the parenthesis
[03:27:17] <Cork> nitram201000: function_name <-- reference, function_name() <-- call
[03:29:44] <nitram201000> thanks Cork - and how would I pass the parameter to this fucntion ({MYPAGE.getNews) - i.e. MYPAGE.newsPage
[03:30:13] <Cork> nitram201000: you need to wrap it inside another function like gvo showed
[03:30:26] <Cork> function() { function_name(arg); }
[03:30:31] <gvo> only with one less paren.
[03:31:05] <gvo> copy and paste my example but remove one of the two trailing parens.
[03:31:40] <Cork> nitram201000: another sidenote click(MYPAGE.getNews) is NOT the same as click(function() { MYPAGE.getNews(); })
[03:31:54] <Cork> as the first example would lose the reference to MYPAGE
[03:32:28] <Cork> (this in getNews would be window not MYPAGE)
[03:33:03] <nitram201000> #gvo, #Cork - will do, thanks guys
[03:34:02] <nitram201000> #Cork - appreciate that - that would have been my next hurdle I imagine. Is there a better way I shoudl be doing this?
[03:34:34] <Cork> nitram201000: not really it is just how js object reference works
[03:34:59] <Cork> nitram201000: new standards has bind and a few other features to help handle it
[03:35:10] <Cork> but it doesn't work cross browsers yet
[03:36:22] <nitram201000> #Cork - thanks for the advice - I can hopefully make some progress now - thanks :)

[03:51:13] <boytoy> Hi, how do I hide my header once the user starts scrolling down and also show it again once he or she is back up? http://jsbin.com/aFEQowI/4/edit
[03:53:50] <Cork> boytoy: bind a scroll event listener and check scrollTop
[04:07:51] <Fritz7> hello .. is there anything to help me with canvas
[04:08:08] <Fritz7> i just want to draw lines with color and erase them
[04:12:17] <GibbaTheHutt> fritz, what type of help ? You may want to look into svg and things like raphael.js, but it depends on your requirements really
[04:22:26] <piratdavid> Anyone here that's a master of require.js optimization
[04:22:26] <piratdavid> ??
[04:33:08] <boytoy> Cork: cool 2 sec
[04:42:16] <boytoy> Cork: any thoughts? http://jsbin.com/aFEQowI/5/edit
[04:42:57] <boytoy> or wait did you mean $(window).bind('scroll');?
[04:43:07] <Cork> yes
[04:43:14] <Cork> (and note i can't see you code)
[04:43:58] <boytoy> Cork: can i show you the oneliner?
[04:44:10] <Cork> or just use jsfiddle.net
[04:44:16] <Cork> it isn't as messed up as jsbin
[04:44:23] <boytoy> haha
[04:44:36] <boytoy> oh man every time i settle for one, one of you dudes recommend the other :p
[04:45:25] <Cork> jsfiddle.net is the best one, as long as the service works (without downtime or slow responses)
[04:45:54] <boytoy> cool
[04:45:58] <boytoy> ill remember that
[04:46:34] <boytoy> Cork: i think it's almost working: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/GxWhx/
[04:54:08] <boytoy> Okay recap: At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/GxWhx/ why won't the header show again after the user has scrolled back up?
[04:54:09] <Cork> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/GxWhx/1/
[04:54:22] <boytoy> oooh
[04:54:32] <Cork> you can change the 3 to a lower or higer px number if you like
[04:54:55] <Cork> but it is the number of px from the top of the page the element should show
[04:55:35] <Cork> (and yes 3 is totally arbitrary)
[04:56:24] <boytoy> Cork: even 0 would work?
[04:56:33] <boytoy> doesnt seem to be able to hide yet though
[04:56:37] <Cork> boytoy: yes
[04:56:56] <Cork> hmm might depend per browser
[04:56:59] <Cork> didn't test that
[04:57:00] <Cork> one min
[04:57:17] <boytoy> testing myself now
[04:58:31] <Cork> sigh lovely...
[04:58:36] <boytoy> oh yeah works in firefoxylady
[04:58:51] <Cork> so webkit uses document.body as the scroll parent
[04:58:58] <Cork> that's actually wrong...
[04:59:10] <boytoy> darn
[04:59:14] <boytoy> darnell
[04:59:47] <boytoy> Cork: ought we report that to http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?
[05:00:26] <Cork> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/GxWhx/2/
[05:00:39] <Cork> boytoy: not sure that will help
[05:01:20] <boytoy> :D
[05:01:55] <boytoy> thanks a lot buddy. this one's for my footer where im placing this "Cookies help us deliver our services. By using our services, you agree to our use of cookies. Learn more" notice
[05:02:11] <Cork> SIGH...
[05:02:24] <Cork> and of course ie likes to be different >_<
[05:02:32] <boytoy> hehe
[05:02:38] <boytoy> no worries with that =)
[05:03:01] <boytoy> wait even ie 10?
[05:03:08] <Cork> na this is ie9
[05:03:10] * boytoy has banned ie9 and down
[05:03:15] <boytoy> ah
[05:03:21] <Cork> and ya
[05:03:32] <boytoy> SIGH OF RELIEF
[05:03:34] <Cork> the jquery version and the forgotten console.log was the one at fault
[05:03:56] <boytoy> oh.. hmm..
[05:04:10] <Cork> uh.. sorry
[05:04:20] <Cork> when i switched to 2.0 again it worked there too (and it should)
[05:04:50] <Cork> so looked like it wanted some extra input to clear out the console error
[05:05:01] <Cork> man i hate developing in ie
[05:06:03] <boytoy> quite understandable
[05:13:23] <gvo> I have ignored ie.  If anyone wants to use my page, they need to use something else.
[05:13:35] <gvo> pages
[05:18:04] <seutje> gvo: heh, IE surpasses the competition on some fronts
[05:18:10] <enclaved> which ones
[05:18:15] <seutje> svg rendering times iirc
[05:18:29] <seutje> they were the first to implement hardware accelerated font rendering
[05:18:41] <seutje> they invented font face, contenteditable and ajax
[05:19:20] <enclaved> well svg is pretty much on its way out the door isn't it?
[05:19:28] <seutje> how so?
[05:20:54] <sammich> they need ASVG :)
[05:21:21] <sammich> not that I'd know what to do with it
[05:22:00] <gvo> maybe but it's a pain to make things work.  SInce I don't run windows I can't even test it.
[05:22:42] <seutje> sammich: animated svg?
[05:22:50] <enclaved> oh i dunno i can't think of many reasons to use it that aren't gimmicky but i'm no expert in graphics
[05:23:02] <seutje> SVGs can contain scripts and styles, so they are inherently animated
[05:23:13] <seutje> enclaved: retina? o.O
[05:23:15] <sammich> well, there you go
[05:23:31] <enclaved> hmm retina is an interesting though
[05:23:35] <sammich> nothing gimmiky about vector graphics
[05:23:50] <seutje> wish all my assets were delivered as vectors
[05:24:00] <sammich> it's just that they are just more difficult in getting them right
[05:24:05] <seutje> fonts are also sometimes served as svg
[05:24:24] <seutje> I'd say rasterized images are harder to get right
[05:24:45] <seutje> once u have anti-aliasing going on, it starts to depend heavily where on the pixel your shape ends
[05:25:02] <seutje> rasterizing it can make a huge difference it it's .5 px to the left/right
[05:25:16] <seutje> vectors are sub-pixel accurate
[05:25:27] <sammich> well, they're vectors
[05:26:23] <seutje> btw, IE10 is faster than chrome on windows
[05:26:26] <sammich> so, are full colour/full fill images well suited for SVG?
[05:26:41] <seutje> I mean load times and rendering times, not javascript execution times
[05:27:12] <seutje> sammich: you mean like big chunks in a single color?
[05:27:40] <sammich> I guess, cartoon/cell filled images
[05:27:54] <sammich> solid colours, nothing complex
[05:28:28] <seutje> yeah, that's what it's really good for
[05:29:03] <sammich> how far before would you go before just going for a rasterised image?
[05:29:13] <sammich> What isn't vector well suited for?
[05:29:30] <sammich> Obviously you don't trace out a photo in Illustrator
[05:30:00] <arschmitz> sammich: have you had a chance to try jqm alpha 2?
[05:30:08] <alip2890> hi. i'm using draggable from ui 1.10.3. when scrolling down a page and starting a drag, the helper is mispositioned (somewhere way down)
[05:30:44] <sammich> arschmitz: yeah, but it's only on my small page
[05:31:01] <ChineseCockBuffe> The Chinese Cock Buffet is currently closed.
[05:31:02] <alip2890> anyone knows a fix? i tried iframeFix and containment options, but that didn't help
[05:31:30] <arschmitz> sammich: cool yeah i was just curious because you mentioned you were going to when it was released
[05:32:02] <sammich> arschmitz: yeah, I was on holiday when it was released but saw it yesterday when I got back
[05:32:37] <arschmitz> cool
[05:32:38] <sammich> haven't had a deep look into it, just updated the files and that's about it
[05:32:46] <sammich> since you're here though
[05:32:51] <arschmitz> lol
[05:33:17] <sammich> I'm not sure if it's just the way I set it up, but the shadow from the panel doesn't overlap the stuff inside the panel
[05:33:27] <sammich> oops, lemme rephrase that
[05:33:55] <Whirl3d> is there a better way to handle the back state and to prohibit page refresh than BBQ?
[05:34:01] <sammich> normally, pre 1.4, a panel gets a shadow from the 'page' cast onto the panel contents, but now the panel contents sit over that shadow
[05:34:23] <sammich> lemme see if I can grab a shot
[05:34:45] <arschmitz> sammich: is this what your talking about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6259
[05:34:45] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6259 by jamiepk (2w 5d ago): Panel content seems to have zindex issue
[05:35:17] <sammich> arschmitz: yeah that's it
[05:35:24] <lemonsparrow> hi i have 4 different $.ready() inside same html... I need to execute something right after all 4 $.ready() has been compeleted.. how to do that ?
[05:35:41] <arschmitz> sammich: ok yeah thats something custom we added for demos
[05:36:05] <sammich> yeah. so we need to just add in the CSS?
[05:36:11] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:36:23] <arschmitz> the demo center is not fully updated yet though
[05:36:38] <arschmitz> we are working on that now that we are done with alphas
[05:36:50] <Whirl3d> lemonsparrow, consider setting up a function that calls each of them then calls your other function. Run that function in one on.ready event
[05:36:53] <sammich> it seems like that shadow should be on top, by default
[05:37:17] <arschmitz> yeah by default we dont add any shadow in that case
[05:37:33] <arschmitz> but i agree it does look nice which is why we have the demo
[05:37:49] <sammich> no shadow by default?
[05:38:00] <sammich> so how do I have a shadow then?
[05:38:35] <arschmitz> give me a sec to look at that its not an issue i was involved in
[05:40:30] <sammich> cheers
[05:41:08] <arschmitz> sammich: the panel has box shadow but what you see in the demos is a box shadow from the page
[05:41:18] <sammich> I was just about to say that ;)
[05:41:24] <arschmitz> to make it look correct
[05:41:59] <arschmitz> yeah so in the demos we remove the panel boxshadow and add one to ui-panel-content-wrap
[05:43:46] <sammich> sounds about right
[05:45:09] <OnkelTem> Hi
[05:45:32] <OnkelTem> I want to implement a pause when user clicks <a href="">...</a> links. How can I do this?
[05:46:16] <OnkelTem> I think about declaring an event handler like .mousedown, catch click event there, then setTimeout(), and only then continue
[05:46:21] <OnkelTem> Ideas? :)
[05:46:51] <gvo> OnkelTem: Sounds like it would work.
[05:47:24] <OnkelTem> During the pause I want to changle link color (or rather proloooong "active" phase) and maybe play sound. I need this for touch sensitive kiosks
[05:48:39] <OnkelTem> gvo: honestly, I don't know how can I continue. IIRC, to stop event propogation, I call e.preventDefault(), right?
[05:48:48] <OnkelTem> then how can I "continue" it later?
[05:48:57] <no_gravity> Since jquery is kind of the "make stuff work in any browser" tool, i will ask here even though i dont have much hope: can jquery make datalists work in chrome on android?
[05:49:08] <sammich> arschmitz: one more thing (I'm not sure if I brought this one up before): how to make it so that a panel reflows the page after it opens
[05:49:27] <gvo> OnkelTem: That's one way
[05:49:46] <arschmitz> you mean so everything stays in view instead of pushing off the side of the page?
[05:49:52] <skione> hi, I have a div and another div inside it, the inner div is hidden the out div contains text and the inner div. When people click the text I want to show the inner div but I am not sure how to get that context. I am trying to build a single function that I can use mutlilpe times so I only want to do this with classes
[05:50:00] <sammich> I know there's a thing on responsive panels on the 1.3.2 demo, but I tried it and it still did the same thing
[05:50:01] <OnkelTem> gvo: I think I found something: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/351268/how-to-stop-link-being-followed-until-after-jquery-animate-has-complete
[05:50:07] <lemonsparrow> Whirl3d: does code in $.ready() get executed in order ?
[05:50:37] <sammich> arschmitz: yeah, because I applied the responsive CSS which removes the dismissable panel behaviour
[05:50:48] <lemonsparrow> Whirl3d: I mean if I have an ajax call in between.. will the below line wait for it to get over ?
[05:51:07] <sammich> so the user can use the page when the panel is open
[05:52:36] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah we need to update the demo still too :(
[05:52:47] <arschmitz> our demos are quite broken at the moment
[05:52:59] <sammich> this is for my 1.3.2 app anyway
[05:53:06] <sammich> oh wait
[05:53:09] <sammich> no it isn't
[05:53:26] <arschmitz> 1.3.2 should work with that css
[05:53:29] <sammich> sorry for pestering you about this ;)
[05:53:32] <arschmitz> 1.4 wont
[05:53:35] <arschmitz> no its no problem
[05:53:51] <sammich> yeah, I used the 1.3.2 CSS on 1.4
[05:53:54] <arschmitz> you could have easily found something we missed
[05:54:13] <arschmitz> so id rather hear about something i already know about then not hear about something we missed
[05:54:31] <sammich> true
[05:56:04] <skione> so I changed it, the inner div will have unique IDs but the outdiv will have a class, how do I get the ID of the inner div when I click the outer div?
[05:58:09] <sammich> since I'm on a roll: I'm not sure where the issue lies, but I'm getting a scrollbar on my pages that have both fixed header/footer
[05:58:22] <sammich> the content definitely fits without overflow
[05:59:11] <sammich> I made a fix that runs after page ready (and then another 10ms) that removes 1px of padding-top
[05:59:25] <sammich> this is on 1.3.2, btw
[05:59:44] <arschmitz> sammich: thats generaly caused by custom css
[05:59:57] <lemonsparrow> how to apply jquery when on multiple document.ready ?
[06:00:17] <arschmitz> sammich: oh also did you try the panel responsive css in alpha 2
[06:00:24] <arschmitz> im being told it was fixed for alpha 2
[06:00:37] <sammich> use the code from the beta demo pages?
[06:00:44] <sammich> alpha*
[06:00:49] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah
[06:01:01] <sammich> I'll try it at work tomorrow
[06:01:06] <arschmitz> sammich: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/panel-fixed.php is working
[06:01:29] <sammich> ah, excellent
[06:01:32] <arschmitz> ignore elements with no background need to update things to not use swatches that no longer exist :)
[06:01:52] <sammich> I think I can live with it
[06:01:59] <sammich> it has a nice, clean feel though :)
[06:02:24] <arschmitz> should not be a problem for you just in our demos we have theme f applied which we removed
[06:02:45] <arschmitz> lol yeah very minimal we are wanting to actually make a super minimal theme like this at some point
[06:02:51] <arschmitz> but with backgrounds lol
[06:03:15] <sammich> skeleton theme
[06:03:19] <arschmitz> yup
[06:03:37] <arschmitz> nothing fancy just structure background and border
[06:04:09] <arschmitz> sammich: for your content scrolling issue though look for custom css applied to your content or page
[06:04:14] <arschmitz> thats generally the cause
[06:04:15] <sammich> will the release 1.4 include more than just the black/white themes?
[06:04:31] <sammich> yeah, I'll have a closer look tomorrow
[06:04:35] <skione> anyone, get the id of the first div underneath a clicked div?
[06:04:35] <arschmitz> not 100% sure yet but probably not
[06:04:52] <arschmitz> sammich: we want to encourage people to make their own with theme roller
[06:05:12] <sammich> it feels like jQM is applying appropriate padding to the page to account for the header/footer
[06:05:21] <sammich> but it's applying one pixel too pany
[06:05:22] <sammich> many*
[06:05:47] <arschmitz> sammich: its something we are still debating ( what themes to provide out of the box )
[06:05:50] <sammich> arschmitz: yeah, I remember that
[06:06:26] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah iv seen that problem ( scrolling ) a LOT and so far every time iv come across it it was custom css
[06:06:42] <arschmitz> but maybe you have found a bug
[06:06:59] <sammich> in 1.3.2, the black and blue are nice. The white looks a little, off, and the yellow is serviceable
[06:07:35] <sammich> trying to avoid using the white, but sometimes there's just too much black and blue
[06:07:50] <sammich> looking forward to see what I can do with 1.4 though
[06:08:20] <arschmitz> cool yeah
[06:08:52] <seutje> skione: in the rendering tree or the dom tree?
[06:11:01] <henn1nk> At the moment i access the keyup function to send a form to find the address of the user in google maps.. but in this case i send tooo much request to google mapsâ€¦ is there a better way to do this? something like keyup 2secs and THAN send?
[06:11:16] <skione> dom
[06:11:54] <skione> seutje here is my code so far http://pastebin.com/Qy25607M
[06:12:15] <skione> so when someone clicks on the class showForm, I want to show the div underneath
[06:12:38] <lemonsparrow> how to add document.ready() inside $.when
[06:12:53] <seutje> skione: if it's dom, it's simple: event.target.parentNode
[06:13:09] <skione> I need the child
[06:13:15] <lsfc1914> Hello. I have checkbox with (for example) 10 different options. I want to make a button active only when 2 of these options (no matter which ones) are selected. Can you give me some help?
[06:13:24] <sammich> arschmitz: thanks again.
[06:13:36] <arschmitz> no problem at all
[06:13:53] <seutje> skione: oh... wtf is :second?
[06:14:07] <seutje> did you mean :eq(1) ?
[06:14:16] <skione> IDK I was shooting blanks
[06:14:26] <seutje> there's docs to this shit, u know
[06:14:27] <skione> I figured if there is a first...
[06:14:33] <sammich> :elventh
[06:14:44] <seutje> think they went as far as :sevenhundrethtwentysecond ? :P
[06:14:47] <skione> oddly it didn't throw an error and returned some values
[06:14:51] <sammich> :ninetyfour
[06:14:52] <sammich> th
[06:15:01] <skione> :sixteynine duh!
[06:15:03] <sammich> :eleventyhundred
[06:15:13] <sammich> :fortysecond
[06:15:31] <seutje> it's not invalid as in, it will throw a dom exception
[06:15:45] <seutje> but it is invalid as in, it isn't recognized
[06:15:57] <seutje> you could extend jquery to handle that though :P
[06:16:10] <sammich> challenge accepted!
[06:16:25] <Cork> yay, ya lets implement ruby in jquery selectors
[06:16:29] <Cork> >_>
[06:16:56] <seutje> :D
[06:17:34] <skione> you laught but second works
[06:17:37] <skione> *laugh
[06:17:40] * sammich does the Ruby tute
[06:18:42] <henn1nk> or any idea for an alternative usage of this input field? but i don't like to use a submit button :/
[06:19:12] <seutje> skione: forreal?
[06:19:24] <Cork> henn1nk: you should always have a form and an input field (in the dom)
[06:19:32] <henn1nk> Cork: do i have
[06:19:32] <skione> seriously http://jsfiddle.net/95KQ2/
[06:19:36] <Cork> henn1nk: you can hide them and depend on other things though
[06:19:44] <skione> I swear it was an act of desperation
[06:19:55] <henn1nk> Cork: but i don't want to use a submit button for the user
[06:20:00] <skione> Click Show Form
[06:20:21] <henn1nk> Cork: would be nicer to just enter a city and after 1-2 sec no change in this input field i send the form
[06:20:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is this format right ? 		$.when( $.ready() ).then(function(){    console.log("alerts 200" ); }); so that console.log gets executed after document.ready() is finished executing including completion of all ajax calls made from within document.ready()  ??
[06:20:39] <seutje> skione: holy 1.3.2!
[06:20:51] <Cork> henn1nk: that should be fairly simple
[06:20:51] <skione> lol
[06:21:07] <Cork> henn1nk: if nothing else you could have a look at autocompete (jquery ui)
[06:21:22] <seutje> skione: doesn't work for me http://jsfiddle.net/6mTtc/
[06:21:26] <Cork> lemonsparrow: uh, no
[06:21:40] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what on earth are you trying to do with $.ready??
[06:23:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje I have 4 different document.ready() and within 4 of these I am making an ajax calls... I want some code to be executed right after all the ajax calls are completed.. so in short after all 4 document.ready() is completed executing including completion of all ajax calls too..
[06:23:25] <Cork> lemonsparrow: uh
[06:23:46] <seutje> lemonsparrow: stick em all in an array and $.when.call(saidArray)
[06:23:48] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you will have a bit of a trouble if the different ready calls are in different files
[06:23:54] <seutje> yeah
[06:23:55] <Cork> cause then you won't be able to do that
[06:24:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje so I tried $.when( $.ready() ).then(function() with this reference http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3709597/wait-until-all-jquery-ajax-request-are-done#answer-9865124
[06:24:11] <Cork> (as you don't know when all ajax calls has been queued)
[06:24:18] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you can't bind on ready
[06:24:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yes they are all in different files in fact 4 files
[06:24:22] <Cork> it isn't a deferred
[06:24:24] <seutje> those are ajax calls
[06:24:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then you can't solve it this way
[06:24:46] <seutje> $.ready() doesn't magically return all ajax calls called within its handler
[06:25:05] <Cork> lemonsparrow: hmm, wait, are you including these files in the head?
[06:25:06] <asker> hey guys, im trying to implement drag&drop. when i drop a div, the center of it will be considered as cursor for drops. how do i change it do the mouse cursor so if a div is over several droppable object it will take the one object that has the cursor over?
[06:25:11] <seutje> and then still, u need them as separate arguments for just sticking it in $.when()
[06:25:12] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje ok so what's the solution.. I am having to bloody add setTimeout now.. which is so stupid.. :-/
[06:25:23] <Cork> lemonsparrow: or at the bottom of body
[06:25:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no I am including this in body
[06:25:44] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then you have async ness in the order
[06:25:50] <Cork> you won't know when things are done
[06:25:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: right
[06:26:17] <seutje> you'd have to keep some global counter or some shit and hardcore the amount of ready callbacks ur waiting for
[06:26:19] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the best you can do is to have something like window.ajaxCalls = []; and then do window.ajaxCall.push
[06:26:22] <seutje> hardcode*
[06:26:33] <Cork> and when all the calls are in there do the call in the ready that happen to get them all
[06:26:40] <Cork> only way to get it queued safly
[06:26:45] <Cork> *safely
[06:26:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I am using DWR and not primitive ajax
[06:27:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well this is still what you have to do
[06:27:25] <seutje> lol?
[06:27:27] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you have no structure you can depend on, so you have to make one
[06:27:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what If I include all the js files inside head
[06:27:44] <seutje> I'm keeping that quote
[06:27:56] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then you can expect them to run in order
[06:28:00] <Cork> and the last file to run last
[06:28:16] <Cork> though that also means the page will stall until the files has loaded and executed
[06:29:34] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I dont have problem with page stalling
[06:29:35] <Cork> lemonsparrow: cleanest is prob to factor out the queuing and calling into its own structure, and have the rest call it, and then let it worry about if all the extected calls is in queue or not
[06:30:01] <Cork> then the lib could keep a reference to the different jqXHR objects and do the when in them
[06:30:12] <Cork> s/in/on/
[06:30:50] <alip2890> lemonsparrow, what about a counter which gets incremented by the ajax success callbacks, and when it reachs 4 call the last function
[06:30:57] <seutje> he's not using jQuery's ajax, so there's no jqXHR
[06:31:01] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok .. i will try adding in order the js files to head first.. to see if that works
[06:31:24] <lemonsparrow> alip2890: that came to my mind but I guess thats too naive
[06:32:15] <lemonsparrow> alip2890: and that's not feasible since this could affect other functionalities after page has loaded and I toggle with dom elements
[06:32:48] <Cork> lemonsparrow: also have you though about concating your js files
[06:32:58] <Cork> that would solve much of these problems :)
[06:34:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what does that mean ?
[06:34:27] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well each js file you load costs in overhead and response time from the server
[06:34:41] <Cork> so it is quite common to have the js files concated into one big file
[06:34:57] <Cork> that saves on loading time, and removes the problem of asyncness you have
[06:35:08] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but that affects tracability and code reading easiness
[06:35:22] <Cork> lemonsparrow: not really
[06:35:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the whole point of having them in separate file is to improve  code structuring
[06:35:51] <Cork> if you name your functions sanely it should be easy to find where they belong
[06:36:03] <Cork> lemonsparrow: for coding ya, not on the site
[06:36:13] <sammich> lemonsparrow: not if you understood how networking works
[06:36:37] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you want separate files when you code, but not when you serve it on the site
[06:36:40] <sammich> over the internet, things take an eternity to load
[06:36:58] <henn1nk> Cork: i found a better solution
[06:37:32] <sammich> if you think about it, applications are built as hundreds of separate source files but you compile them all into one fat binary
[06:37:59] <Cork> sammich: that is a little beside the point actually
[06:38:20] <Cork> and not really true if you count dynamicly linked programs
[06:38:51] <sammich> the time scales are a little off, but relatively, there is a latency cost
[06:39:18] <Cork> no the load latency has nothing with why you compile things on a computer
[06:40:16] <sammich> not a perfect analogy
[06:40:38] <sammich> point I was trying to make is that, once you deploy, you don't need the dev copy
[06:40:46] <sammich> you don't need readability
[06:40:57] <Cork> you do to some extent
[06:41:19] <Cork> but you need to cater for what it costs, and some of it is easy to handle, to small costs
[06:41:34] <Cork> and having the files concated is one of those
[06:41:42] <seutje> sometimes shit only blows up on prod
[06:42:09] <sammich> source maps :)
[06:42:37] <Cork> cat *.js > scripts.js
[06:42:40] <Cork> easy enough :D
[06:42:45] <aro> how do i determine (on page load) if the currently selected index of a select element has a certain class?
[06:43:01] <Cork> aro: class=
[06:43:02] <Cork> *?
[06:43:07] <Cork> you mean on the option?
[06:43:10] <sammich> option?
[06:43:12] <aro> yes
[06:43:25] <seutje> $('select').find(':selected').hasClass('theClass')
[06:43:46] <aro> i was doing this for onchange event:         var isNMI = ($('option:selected',this).hasClass('is_nmi'));
[06:43:54] <aro> but i dont know how to do it when there isnt a listener
[06:44:18] <seutje> like, just onload?
[06:44:23] <Cork> $('#select_id option:selected')
[06:44:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje what I did now is moved in order all 4 js files to head tag and then added a script tag within head tag itself below these js file inclusion to add code that needs to be executred
[06:44:45] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ya that should work
[06:44:47] <seutje> a script with a head inside the head?
[06:44:49] <seutje> o.O
[06:44:55] <Cork> lol
[06:45:00] <seutje> oh nvm, can't read today
[06:45:07] <seutje> read "with" instead of "within"
[06:45:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: script tag within head tag seutje lol
[06:45:31] <Cork> a seutje tag!
[06:45:33] <seutje> lemonsparrow: but that will be executed before the ajax returns
[06:45:55] <seutje> Cork: it's implied to be unique, not per page, not per domain, but per internet!
[06:46:05] <Cork> lol
[06:46:12] <sysdef> how can i extract double elements (duplicates) from a list?
[06:46:29] <aro> cork, that doesnt work
[06:46:33] <Cork> sysdef: duplicate in what way?
[06:46:47] <seutje> aro: you didn't copy that ID exactly over, did you?
[06:46:52] <Cork> aro: and you replaced select_id with the correct id right?
[06:47:04] <aro> ....yes
[06:47:13] <Cork> and you run it in a ready callback?
[06:47:17] <lemonsparrow> seutje: Cork something like this what I did and it seems to work https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6281673
[06:47:19] <seutje> hey man, no need for the dots, we see some shit in here
[06:47:27] <aro> yes
[06:47:33] <aro> lol
[06:47:35] <aro> i know
[06:47:49] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that will run before the ajax callbacks run
[06:47:59] <seutje> like that guy with his tablet apps earlier
[06:48:08] <Cork> aro: and you added the hasClass and things after that right?
[06:48:09] <aro> :)
[06:48:15] <aro> ya
[06:48:20] <Cork> interesting
[06:48:32] <seutje> broke the internet :(
[06:48:41] <Cork> aro: what does console.log($('#select_id option').length) give you?
[06:48:42] <skione> damn kids
[06:48:51] <sysdef> Cork: i need ['bar','baz'] as result from ['bar','baz','bar','baz','foo','bar']
[06:49:05] <Cork> sysdef: you said elements
[06:49:17] <Cork> sysdef: are you talking about filtering an array of strings?
[06:49:18] <aro> '1'
[06:49:45] <Cork> aro: and console.log($('#select_id option:selected').length) is 0?
[06:49:52] <aro> nope
[06:49:53] <aro> its 1
[06:49:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje what about this ? https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6281673
[06:50:10] <sysdef> Cork: yes. as in .ununiq ^^
[06:50:13] <Cork> aro: and console.log($('#select_id option:selected').length).prop('class')) ?
[06:50:23] <Nancy2012> how to validate my multi select dropdown http://jsfiddle.net/5XFah/
[06:50:45] <seutje> sysdef: take a pick: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960473/unique-values-in-an-array
[06:50:49] <aro> will that work?
[06:51:03] <aro> .length).prop('class')
[06:51:37] <Cork> aro: opps no
[06:51:46] <Cork> aro: meant console.log($('#select_id option:selected').prop('class'))
[06:51:55] <seutje> lemonsparrow: lol, that's the same thing we started out with q.q
[06:52:01] <aro> ok
[06:52:06] <aro> that returns the class name
[06:52:09] <sysdef> seutje: thx!
[06:52:11] <aro> correctly
[06:52:20] <seutje> lemonsparrow: whatever deferred you will get from $.ready() will probably resolve immediately
[06:52:33] <seutje> disregarding those ajax calls
[06:52:38] <Cork> aro: then console.log($('#select_id option:selected').hasClass('is_nmi')) should be true
[06:52:51] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I am going crazy lol.. cork you told me to add the js files in order to head tag and why is it not working ? :(
[06:53:00] <lemonsparrow> seutje: but it seems to be working now lol Cork
[06:53:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: cause you missed half of what i said...
[06:53:13] <seutje> lemonsparrow: that was to make sure it ran after the document ready statements
[06:53:26] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you need to queue the calls, and then make all the calls when you KNOW you have the full set
[06:53:31] <seutje> it's probably working cause you ajax calls are short enough
[06:53:41] <seutje> so yeah, u need to know beforehand how many ajax calls you are making
[06:53:54] <seutje> so u can determine when all have been fired
[06:54:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje how to do that ?
[06:54:39] <Cork> lemonsparrow: var ajax_calls = []; then push the info you need to this array
[06:54:46] <Cork> in the last script section do all the calls
[06:55:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u mean to add the ajax calls to the ajax_calls ?
[06:55:17] <seutje> keep a variable that spans over all the scopes involved, store the jqXHR objects returned from $.ajax(), and every time u add one, check if you've reached the limit
[06:55:18] <Cork> that would only work if the ajax calls have deferred
[06:55:26] <seutje> when you do, pipe em into a $.when
[06:55:31] <Cork> else no, you would have to push the data to use in the ajax calls to the array
[06:57:02] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje I am using DWR something like this https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6281673#file-gistfile2-js
[06:57:17] <nooneelse> Hi everyone, I take a look at jQuery API and saw that jQuery.live is obsolete and that I should use jQuery.on, but when I try jQuery('.buttonDinamicallyGenerated').on('click', function(event){ alert('test'); }); it doesn't works for the new buttons inserted using jQuery.append(). It wasn't supposed to bind that click action for every item?
[06:57:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje so I have 4 to 5 of such calls in total
[06:58:11] <Cork> nooneelse: read the documentation
[06:58:21] <Cork> nooneelse: an easier place to start is prob delegate
[06:58:37] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:58:40] <nooneelse> Cork, thanks I'll take a look
[06:58:49] <Cork> nooneelse: on is a combination function
[06:58:56] <Cork> nooneelse: it isn't a replacement for live
[06:59:05] <Cork> it is delegate and bind merged into one function
[06:59:33] <seutje> lemonsparrow: yeah, figured you weren't using "primitive" $.ajax
[06:59:36] <Cork> nooneelse: and delegate is the replacement for live (since 1.4)
[06:59:56] <nooneelse> Cork, really? I'm really outdated lol
[06:59:57] <seutje> unfortunately, "primitive" $.ajax supports promises, this... no clue
[07:00:35] <nooneelse> cork Thanks i'll take a look at the api's pages
[07:00:58] <Cork> lemonsparrow: like i said before push the data for DWRLogic.loadUsers into the array
[07:01:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then make the calls last in the collection url
[07:01:36] <Cork> there you can loop them and reference in what ever order you like
[07:02:01] <seutje> what does that return?
[07:02:39] <Cork> donno
[07:02:57] <seutje> is that a custom method or does it come with the library?
[07:03:27] <Cork> DWR
[07:03:30] <Cork> like he said
[07:04:17] <seutje> oh, it's just straight bindings?
[07:04:18] <Jayflux> hey guys, if i add a click handler to an <a> element, will it fire that function before going off to another page?
[07:04:26] <seutje> ugh
[07:04:33] <Cork> Jayflux: yes
[07:04:34] <johnkpaul> Jayflux: yes
[07:04:48] <Jayflux> Does the function have to return true? or is taht optional?
[07:04:55] <Cork> no
[07:04:56] <Jayflux> that*
[07:05:09] <Cork> you use event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the default action
[07:05:17] <Cork> event is the first argument to the callback
[07:05:39] <Cork> if you don't call it the default action (loading the href) happens
[07:05:45] <_pash> hello, i have a div thats display:none, when i get its height it gives me one value, when i get its height when its display: block, its another, why?
[07:06:10] <seutje> display: none is removed from the rendering tree
[07:06:16] <seutje> thus it has no height
[07:06:17] <seutje> 0x0
[07:06:44] <seutje> also display: inline will collapse top/bottom padding
[07:07:12] <Cork> and margin will be ignored
[07:07:35] <serapath> hi
[07:07:54] <serapath> is it possible to get the exact name of a match of a 'fuzzy selector' ?
[07:08:04] <serapath> like $('[id$="foo"]')
[07:08:12] <Cork> what name do you mean?
[07:08:14] <serapath> maybe it matched 'barfoo' and 'bazfoo'
[07:08:18] <Cork> ah
[07:08:30] <Cork> just add .prop('id')
[07:08:36] <_pash> seutje: is it possible to get the actual height of the display none div?
[07:08:45] <Cork> (though you should NEVER select on $ or ^for id's)
[07:08:56] <serapath> ok, maybe the example was bad
[07:09:05] <serapath> imagine it was 'class' instead
[07:09:07] <Cork> _pash: change it to something other then none
[07:09:17] <serapath> there are several classes
[07:09:17] <seutje> _pash: set it to block, measure it and set it back
[07:09:24] <serapath> i want to remove a specific one and add another one
[07:09:38] <serapath> but i got the element by such a fuzzy selector
[07:09:41] <Cork> removeClass().addClass() is prob the simplest for that
[07:09:42] <serapath> how to know which to remove?
[07:09:46] <serapath> yes
[07:09:50] <serapath> but i need to know the exact name
[07:09:58] <serapath> but only have a fuzzy selector which matched one or more elements
[07:10:02] <Cork> class is prob a bad example too
[07:10:04] <NoiseEee> serapath: so you're looking for a class you dont know the name of ?  o.O?
[07:10:07] <Cork> but ya i get the idea
[07:10:13] <NoiseEee> serapath: why not ask your real question?
[07:10:14] <serapath> NoiseEee
[07:10:17] <Cork> serapath: use prop('attribute-name')
[07:10:22] <serapath> i know the pattern of the name
[07:10:28] <serapath> but not the exact name
[07:10:44] <serapath> i want to change something on ALL elements which have that pattern
[07:11:01] <NoiseEee> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1227286/get-class-list-for-element-with-jquery @ serapath
[07:11:07] <Cork> serapath: $('[data-name$="som"]').prop('data-name')
[07:11:22] <serapath> Cork: btw, if i had several widgets on a page, each with its unique ID, but  widgetX-1, widgetX-2, widgetX-3 ...
[07:11:26] <serapath> that would be nice
[07:11:37] <Cork> serapath: then you should give them a class
[07:11:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: u asked me to add the data from DWr call to var ajax_calls = []; but the porblem is the same ajax calls are being recalled when user sorts the data.. that time should I add a flag or something so that data doesnt get added to queue again ?
[07:11:53] <serapath> ah i understand
[07:11:55] <Cork> serapath: selecting on fuzzy means you DON'T use the id's speed
[07:12:03] <sysdef> i think i have the problem that people tend to misinterpret the task. i need to find the doubles in a list. not to unique a list
[07:12:18] <Cork> serapath: if you use the attribute selector ([]) the browser will do a full dom search
[07:12:33] <Cork> serapath: and that is the second slowest form of selection you can do
[07:12:40] <serapath> Cork: the thing is, i'm using "external code" and that code generates elements on the DOM which i have to manipulate, but the author did not give it ID's
[07:12:46] <serapath> so i have to find another way
[07:13:23] <Cork> sysdef: $.map(arr, function(val, i) { return arr.indexOf(val) !== i; })
[07:13:25] <serapath> otherwise i have to change the libary itself
[07:13:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ?
[07:14:00] <serapath> Cork: ok, so if i use .prop it would give me all classes, do i have to use a regex then?
[07:14:11] <serapath> ..to get the class i want to have?
[07:14:17] <Cork> serapath: why?
[07:14:28] <Cork> serapath: if you really want to work with classes, use removeClass and addClass
[07:14:35] <Cork> no need to use the class attribute
[07:14:46] <Cork> serapath: but for other attributes that would work
[07:14:52] <Cork> it's pointless to use it for classes
[07:14:59] <serapath> because maybe the element has  class="a b c d e f g stuff bar baz barfoo"
[07:15:16] <Cork> serapath: when you call the widget to create it you can then give it a class
[07:15:18] <serapath> and i use $('[class$="foo"]');
[07:15:21] <Cork> serapath: it isn't that hard
[07:15:23] <NoiseEee> serapath: why not ask your real question?
[07:15:32] <serapath> it is my real question
[07:15:39] <serapath> its only not 'foo' but 'grid'
[07:15:40] <Cork> serapath: that is also something you should not select on
[07:15:47] <smallfoot-> Should I declare all my event listeners in the same place?
[07:15:52] <serapath> Cork: its not my code
[07:15:58] <smallfoot-> Should I declare my event listeners in the top or the bottom? Before or after functions?
[07:15:59] <Cork> serapath: remove mar from the barfoo
[07:16:00] <serapath> Cork: its a project dpeendency
[07:16:06] <Cork> ...
[07:16:14] <smallfoot-> Should I declare event listeners inside or outside global scope? Which scope should I declare them in?
[07:16:18] <Cork> man what with all these shitty codes! T_T
[07:16:23] <serapath> Cork: its created that way, but i need to change its behavior
[07:16:38] <Cork> serapath: then list all the duplicate class names
[07:17:00] <Cork> serapath: you don't want to use class or id by attribute, it removes the hole point of having them
[07:17:08] <serapath> its actually something that doesnt behave 'responsively' and i need to change that to some degree, therefor adding different css
[07:17:09] <smallfoot-> Should my event listeners call a named function or an anonymous function?
[07:17:36] <NoiseEee> smallfoot-: a named function is more convenient / re-usable, dont you think?
[07:17:40] <Cork> serapath: well i would recommend just adding an additional class statically
[07:17:55] <Cork> serapath: list the freakish class names and add a sane one
[07:18:05] <serapath> hmm ok
[07:18:30] <Cork> having class names on an element is quite low cost
[07:19:18] <smallfoot-> NoiseEee: yes, but in examples, I see anonymous functions all the time
[07:19:51] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I added the ajax data for all ajax calls and now the ajax_calls.length does show 4.. now how to move forward ?
[07:20:51] <Cork> lemonsparrow: if you need to have the function callable from the original place later
[07:20:59] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the counter solution is prob what you need
[07:21:37] <Cork> lemonsparrow: though you would have to add a callback solution to trigger the function to check the count number from the callbacks
[07:22:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: alternatively loop the array and then make the ajax calls in the last function
[07:22:30] <Cork> but that solution won't work if you need to function callable
[07:22:46] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so now I have 4 different document.ready which inturns calls multiple ajax calls.. total of 7 ajax calls and every where I do push the data into the ajax_calls[] and finally I do get the ajax_calls.length as 7
[07:23:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ugg
[07:23:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: now when the count is 7, I know all my ajax calls are complete.. so what should be the logic to trigger the rest of the code now?
[07:23:16] <Cork> you have a really messy structure on the page...
[07:23:39] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to have a function each of the ajax call calls in there success callback
[07:23:46] <Cork> and it checks the count
[07:23:47] <Jayflux> can you use .ready with other selectors?
[07:23:53] <Cork> no
[07:23:59] <Cork> it's not a selector
[07:24:04] <Cork> its a callback handler
[07:24:49] <Cork> Jayflux: ready is a callback that circles around the DOMContentLoaded + load
[07:24:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but the main concern is that I am recalling some of these ajax calls after the page loads for things like sorting of data and all.. so wont this code conflict then to create issues ?
[07:25:01] <Cork> plus it's called if one of them has been triggered in the browser
[07:25:19] <Cork> Jayflux: so it only works on elements where those event normally trigger; meaning document
[07:25:47] <Cork> lemonsparrow: depends on how you do the check
[07:26:01] <Cork> lemonsparrow: but honestly, you should clean up the code instead
[07:26:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I think I would need a flag :( that's kinda bad coding
[07:27:43] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the code is full of races and THAT is not grate coding
[07:27:54] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hmm
[07:28:45] <Cork> you have totally independent block doing there thing async, but depends on each other
[07:28:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: right
[07:28:59] <Cork> that is a fragile structure
[07:29:20] <Cork> instead you should have them do there own thing, but not act on there own
[07:29:35] <Cork> and then have a central core that starts everything
[07:29:46] <Cork> then you can pass callbacks in or what ever and things would just work
[07:29:57] <Cork> you would not have races as only one point executes code
[07:30:23] <Cork> separate ready points is fine as long as they don't care about each other what so ever
[07:31:58] <sysdef> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/sysdef/x939j/1/
[07:33:25] <jop008> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/bxfhM/85/ when I click on the listbox    an alert must be made showing xx
[07:33:31] <jop008> but no xx alert
[07:33:45] <Cork> sysdef: gah
[07:33:49] <Cork> sorry i meant to use grep >_<
[07:34:16] <Cork> sysdef: one min let me fix it
[07:35:15] <Cork> sysdef: http://jsfiddle.net/x939j/5/
[07:37:00] <Cork> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/bxfhM/86/
[07:37:17] <Cork> jop008: or bind the event listner after the append on line 17
[07:37:50] <Cork> jop008: you selector doesn't work cause the element isn't in the tree when you do the selection
[07:39:31] <sysdef> Cork: yay, thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/sysdef/x939j/6/
[07:40:21] <Cork> sysdef: why are you running the result array through $.unieuq?!?
[07:42:22] <sysdef> Cork: i tried to remove the double 'foo' in the result "foo,foo,baz"
[07:42:49] <Cork> sysdef: unique is for dom elements not strings in an array
[07:43:37] <serapath> Cork: is it a good idea to set style attributes via javascript?
[07:43:38] <sysdef> i see
[07:43:49] <Cork> serapath: not really
[07:43:52] <serapath> Cork: i have a container which should scale according to the amount of elements it contains
[07:43:57] <serapath> Cork: how would i do that?
[07:44:18] <Cork> serapath: position: relative; ?
[07:44:41] <Cork> uh sorry i'm getting tired
[07:44:46] <Cork> i meant overflow: hidden;
[07:45:01] <Cork> serapath: css can handle scaling a parent by the children
[07:45:04] <Cork> no need for js
[07:45:21] <serapath> but it always creates a scrollbar instead of scaling the container
[07:45:34] <Cork> then you have a fixed size on the parent
[07:45:55] <Cork> and overflow is only needed if you have floating children
[07:47:48] <sysdef> Cork: ugly? http://jsfiddle.net/sysdef/x939j/7/
[07:48:25] <Cork> sysdef: did you want a list of all duplicate items?
[07:48:31] <Cork> *didn't
[07:48:38] <Cork> that is what the first call will give you
[07:48:48] <Cork> if you want the oposite, just change !== to ===
[07:49:06] <serapath> Cork: if i remove the height from the element, it sets it to 0
[07:49:29] <Cork> serapath: are the children floating?
[07:49:37] <serapath> no
[07:49:40] <serapath> dont think so
[07:49:47] <Cork> are they position absolute?
[07:49:56] <serapath> guess not
[07:49:57] <serapath> nope
[07:50:08] <Cork> they have to be one of them
[07:50:12] <Cork> else the height wouldn't be 0
[07:50:35] <serapath> ok, i check again
[07:51:05] <serapath> parent container is position relative
[07:51:16] <Cork> not the parent the children
[07:51:42] <Cork> if you want the children to affect the size of the parent they have to be in the page flow
[07:51:58] <sysdef> Cork: i need a list of all doubles like "foo,baz". not like "foo,foo,foo,baz,baz,baz,foo,foo,foo,foo,foo"
[07:52:32] <Cork> sysdef: so you want uniq occurrences of the duplicate occurrences? :D
[07:53:01] <sysdef> Cork: thanks for that exact definition :o)
[07:53:53] <serapath> Cork: wow, this is like searching a needle in a haystack
[07:53:56] <serapath> ...hate it
[07:54:04] <Cork> sysdef: so http://jsfiddle.net/x939j/8/ ?
[07:54:37] <Cork> hmm could prob improve this one...
[07:54:40] <serapath> Cork: yes, they are position absolute

[08:01:29] <traets> Does anyone know a convernient way to convert a string like "?cid=foo&var=bar&name=doe" into a json ?
[08:03:04] <traets> i found a function out there, but was wondering if jquery has builtin way or something
[08:03:10] <joker_89> hi i use jquery ui css file, and works great if it's linked remote, but wrong if is local
[08:07:12] <jop008> the test button should trigger showpersons http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/fLKZG/4/
[08:07:18] <gmag> let's say I have $(".someClass").click(func);    How can I, inside func, know which element invoked the callback?
[08:07:27] <jop008> but it doen't
[08:07:40] <NoiseEee> gmag: in general, you should ditch 'click' and use 'on'
[08:08:47] <NoiseEee> gmag: $('.someClass').on('click',function(e) { var clickedElement = e.target; //don't forget to $ if you want to use jquery methods});
[08:10:19] <gmag> NoiseEee, I can define the function outside, right? Like function handler(e){bla bla}; and then pass handler, right?
[08:10:31] <NoiseEee> gmag: indeed

[08:11:26] <gmag> NoiseEee, thanks
[08:12:10] <jop008> Can someone help me on this http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/fLKZG/4/
[08:12:23] <jop008> The test button does nothing
[08:12:41] <jop008> the main problem is bottom and header are gone after an insert
[08:12:50] <jop008> a dom insert
[08:13:26] <gmag> NoiseEee, what do you mean with the comment you added to the code?
[08:13:46] <gmag> NoiseEee, where should I not ofrget to use the $?
[08:13:56] <NoiseEee> gmag: if you want to use jquery methods on the element clicked, you need to turn it into an object.  ie: var target = $(e.target);
[08:17:08] <gmag> NoiseEee, what about using $(this)? Isnt $(this) the element that was clicked?
[08:18:13] <NoiseEee> gmag: it is, unless you were using delegation, in which case "this" tends to be the element with the handler, not necessarily the element clicked
[08:18:19] <NoiseEee> e.target, can't go wrong.
[08:20:33] <gmag> NoiseEee, thanks a lot mate! Really helpful.
[08:20:49] <NoiseEee> gmag: np, good luck

[08:46:49] <rgr> whats the recommended way to tell if an element does NOT have any children? (think along the lines of wanting a dialog to close itself when the last of its kids a removed).
[08:47:46] <Changa> Hello, I am using .load to load content on to the page but my function sometimes works and sometimes it doesnt. -> screen shot of firebug. http://i40.tinypic.com/2iqho3n.jpg
[08:48:26] <rgr> aha :empty
[08:48:51] <duch_kazatel> rgr that works.  or check the length of something like $('p *');
[08:48:59] <duch_kazatel> but if there's a native method, that's probably safer
[09:13:13] <sysdef> Cork: any suggestions to line 19 to ignore empty values? http://jsfiddle.net/sysdef/x939j/12/
[09:18:51] <duch_kazatel> sysdef if(val !== undefined) {
[09:18:57] <duch_kazatel> or val != null
[09:19:30] <duch_kazatel> or you can check the length - if(val.length > 0) {
[09:21:08] <T13|playingDad> Or a number of other things...
[09:22:04] <T13|playingDad> Is your input a string, number, or other object of some kind?

[10:13:50] <katsh> is it possible to unbind events from an element that is appended to the dom after it loads?
[10:13:54] <katsh> i know you can bind using $.on
[10:13:56] <katsh> how do you unbind
[10:14:32] <jwmann> katsh: .unbind()
[10:15:11] <jwmann> Okay, so I'm using ccs3 transitions for my animations but I used jQuery to switch the classes that trigger the animation. Thing is, after hiding some elements, I need to display: none; them and transitions seem to break when you apply inline styles to them.. Anyone know of a workaround? (essentially, 1. switch classses 2. display: none everything after transition 3. display: block individual element 4. apply class to start transitio
[10:17:04] <katsh> jwmann: right. but for unbind() to work i need to have the element there. I don't know when the element will be added
[10:17:10] <katsh> but whenever it is, i need to unbind it right away
[10:17:52] <jwmann> katsh: Okay, try using deferred objects then
[10:18:48] <jwmann> katsh: Something like this $.when( $('#mysuperkoolelements') ).then( $(this).unbind() );
[10:19:13] <jwmann> katsh: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[10:21:30] <katsh> thanks
[10:25:54] <jwmann> No problem
[10:30:37] <jwmann> Can anybody lend me hand with that transition issue? :X
[10:36:54] <doug65536> jwmann: what transition issue
[10:37:41] <jwmann> doug65536: I messaged it 10 minutes ago, would you like me to re-ask it?
[10:38:01] <doug65536> jwmann: I found it
[10:38:05] <jwmann> kk
[10:38:51] <doug65536> jwmann: is it fine on chrome and glitchy on firefox?
[10:38:53] <jwmann> I've tried binding to the 'transitionEnd' event but that is not quite ideal since it binds the unintended events too
[10:39:32] <jwmann> doug65536: I have not found an ideal solution yet. I've only tested on chrome and it doesn't work.
[10:40:04] <doug65536> jwmann: can you show code? as far as I know chrome does transitions beautifully
[10:40:14] <jwmann> I've tried binding before the event I want to track and then unbinding after but it happens too quickly for it to track anything
[10:40:46] <jwmann> doug65536: It's not the transitions themselves that's the problem, I'll make a jsFiddle for you
[10:45:54] <nhulea> Hi  I am trying to calculate input fields for when certain select options are selected http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/5Bcb3/ I was wondering if anyone knew where I was going wrong ?
[10:45:57] <nhulea> thanks
[10:48:13] <doug65536> nhulea: id must be unique on a page
[10:48:32] <doug65536> nhulea: you can't assign the same id to multiple elements and expect it to work correctly
[10:49:12] <jwmann> Okay doug65536 here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/AcV5V/1/
[10:49:13] <nhulea> doug65536: you mean #select_grade_limit_both input thanks
[10:50:10] <doug65536> nhulea: I'm guessing from the code, since there is no html in the fiddle, and you do append two objects with the same id at the end
[10:50:31] <jwmann> doug65536: Basically, if you were to change the class 'js-hide' to use display: none; the transitions break because it closes the element before the transition
[10:51:15] <Itrace> I'm trying to use the jQuery Migrate plugin, but I'm not sure how. I've included it in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/oktalk/nsFk9/1/ as a test. The error I'm getting in console appears even if the plug in isn't there. So how should the jQuery Migrate plugin work?
[10:51:24] <nhulea> I can add the html if it will help but yeah I am trying to calc the input of inputs based off which select option is selected
[10:51:35] <jwmann> doug65536: The commented out blocks of code are my attempts to find a workaround.
[10:53:45] <nhulea> maybe theres a way to .addclass if the select value is right let me see
[10:54:03] <doug65536> jwmann: how do I make it behave badly?
[10:55:29] <jwmann> doug65536: change js-hide from display: block; to display: none; and switch between Web and Photography a few times (first time transitions smoothly because of js-semiHide)
[10:57:04] <doug65536> jwmann: yes, it doesn't animate display: changes, right
[10:57:51] <jwmann> doug65536: Yea, that's part of the problem. Because I need to have all .gallery divs to be display:none; instead of the requested one.
[10:57:58] <doug65536> jwmann: when I needed that what I did was, set opacity to 0 before removing that class, remove it, then clear opacity
[10:58:19] <jwmann> doug65536: That's technically what I'm trying to do tbh

[11:14:31] <doug65536> jwmann: I just realized I am practically reimplementing fadeTo. is there some reason you didn't use that?
[11:15:23] <jwmann> doug65536: I didn't know there was a fadeTo() method :S
[11:15:25] <cdehaan> Hello! I've got a pretty simple Javascript/jQuery that gets a JSON file for a list of images, and then sets it as a page background (and then a few other things). This works perfectly in Safari, but not in Chrome... It seems like it's not getting into the jQuery.getJSON('/research_images/_images_list.json', function(data) {}, but this is on the same domain, so I don't get it.
[11:15:43] <doug65536> jwmann: ok... I'll use native jquery fades
[11:18:21] <mcnesium> i am trying to remove a list item by id using $('#players-list').remove('#'+presenceJid);
[11:18:26] <mcnesium> but its giving me Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #dds@waid.srv.local/adium
[11:18:38] <mcnesium> so how do i do it right?

[11:20:45] <JemBijoux> Hey folks. I'm trying to add a stylesheet to pages based on if they're loaded in an iframe or not.
[11:20:52] <JemBijoux> http://pastebin.com/yJ6JQpgV  << Here's what I've got.
[11:22:35] <mcnesium> do i have to escape the special characters?
[11:25:46] <cdehaan> Does anyone have any idea why " jQuery.getJSON('research_images.json', function(data) { " would work in Safari but not Chrome? Clearly not cross-domain issue but seems like it thinks it is???
[11:25:52] <mcnesium> would it be better to use .find(id, function(){ this.remove} ?
[11:40:39] <mcnesium> that brings the same syntax error unrecognized expression
[11:56:37] <sethetter> is there a cross-browser way of binding an event to the display style attribute changing on an element?
[11:56:46] <sethetter> I know there's DOMAttrModified
[11:57:01] <sethetter> But that isn't available in webkit. Does jQuery have a cross-browser solutions for this?
[12:01:30] <snover> sethetter: no
[12:02:13] <sethetter> snover: alright thanks
[12:05:18] <czytacz> I was wondering, is there a way to connect to a database file (sqlite ie.) using only jquery/js?
[12:12:21] <mcnesium> ok this obviously was due to the special characters
[12:27:39] <Al1> is there a possibilty of file upload through ajax? i keep reading stackoverflow and keep coming across "solutions" but most end with that "it's not supported in IE"
[12:29:42] <gates> Is there an easy way to create a textbox that automatically numbers each row as info is entered?
[12:29:58] <maxmoore14> Al1: not using jquery, no
[12:30:30] <whowantstolivefo> hi, i use Refinery CMS with RoR and i follow photo-gallery tutorial in this page and i finished installation parts introducion at here https://github.com/Matho/refinerycms-photo-gallery#installation but it tutorial says " Append <%= render "/refinery/photo_gallery/albums/show" %> to pages/show.html.erb to display photos " i dont have this photo_gallery/*/* files in my file structure, do i must create them manually in fancybox ?
[12:30:57] <Al1> i mena using jquery
[12:30:57] <maxmoore14> you have to use your own xmlrequest
[12:31:00] <Al1> mean*
[12:31:01] <whowantstolivefo> or issue is about which CMS i use ?
[12:32:57] <maxmoore14> Al1: ajax uploads are absolutely possible using xmlrequest, but not using the existing jquery $.ajax
[12:33:39] <Al1> @maxmoore can you possibly point me in a right direction on how to do that, where can i find info?
[12:34:32] <maxmoore14> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
[12:35:16] <Al1> thank you :)
[12:35:25] <maxmoore14> anyone have an estimate on when jqm 1.4 final is expected? alpha 2 was released 5 days ago I think
[12:35:30] <aro> i have an issue.. we have a table that has a series of checkboxes, some of them have 'class_a', some have 'class_b' and some have 'class_a' AND 'class_b' - we want to say 'disable those with class_a - but not if it has class_b'
[12:35:31] <maxmoore14> no problem
[12:36:08] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: beta is targeted for monday
[12:36:27] <aro> but if we say 'disable class_b', we want to now disable the one with class_a and class_b
[12:36:28] <arschmitz> depending on issues that come after beta rc will be a week or 2 after that
[12:36:38] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: and final probably a week after that
[12:36:49] <maxmoore14> so 4ish weeks?
[12:37:11] <aro> is there a good way to do that?
[12:37:14] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: yeah sometime like that roughly
[12:37:29] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: thanks, that helps
[12:38:19] <maxmoore14> aro: look at :not and .filter
[12:38:34] <aro> i did
[12:38:44] <aro> but there isnt a good way to maintain previous state
[12:38:53] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: no problem we are trying to make it pretty quick since we did 2 alphas but it will of course depend on how many issues are reported and their severity
[12:38:56] <aro> we basically need the element to flag the fact that class_a was set to disabled
[12:39:10] <aro> so that when class_b gets set to disabled, it will disable the element
[12:40:08] <marpstar> aro,  why not use another set of classes
[12:40:20] <marpstar> class_a_active, class_a_disabled
[12:40:24] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: I haven't spent much time with it yet, but am I correct that there will be a new event for taphold? or longclick or something?
[12:40:42] <aro> id rather not be adding bunches of classes
[12:41:02] <marpstar> or soemthing like that. there's no good way to know if an element *had* a class if you're going to remove it
[12:41:08] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: not new event but i did add an option to not emit tap on taphold
[12:41:27] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: its a global config option
[12:41:43] <marpstar> you could store the initial state of those classes inside of another element attribute, but you're not going to have the nice hasClass() check for that
[12:42:03] <aro> i could use .data()
[12:42:26] <marpstar> aro, you could do that, too.
[12:43:06] <marpstar> aro: if you're going to use .data(), you'll have to do string comparisons if you're going to just store the initial list of classes
[12:43:10] <platzhirsch> How do I do multiple is() checks? element.is(":empty").is(":hidden") ?
[12:43:42] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: oh, ok. that may help anyway. I'm running into an issue right now where I have a listview - each item has a vmousedown, vmouseup, and vclick handler
[12:43:43] <jsc802> im doing $('a.add').click(function(){   $(this).removeClass( "add" ).addClass( "remove" );
[12:43:45] <jsc802> and its not working
[12:43:45] <marpstar> aro: same problem, but I agree, using .data() would be the nicer way of the two to go
[12:43:57] <jsc802> it lets me keep clicking a.add
[12:44:00] <jsc802> what am i doing wrong?
[12:44:10] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: I'm using a timeout to determine "long" holds
[12:44:18] <aro> jsc802: use .on()
[12:44:26] <jsc802> oh
[12:44:26] <aro> you arent binding to the new class
[12:44:36] <jsc802> i thought click was a shortcut for on
[12:44:41] <jsc802> you are right, tho
[12:44:44] <jsc802> thank you
[12:44:47] <aro> $(document.body).on('click', '.add', function() { });
[12:44:49] <aro> ok
[12:44:50] <aro> yw
[12:44:51] <aro> :)
[12:44:54] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: do you not want to have vmousedown emited on long holds?
[12:44:57] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: works fine on most elements, the problem is, with the listview, when I'm scrolling on a mobile device, it is still triggering events
[12:45:35] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: what events are being triggered?
[12:45:49] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: I'm honestly not sure I've figured out the best way to do this, I may need to listen for a scroll event
[12:46:31] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: I just found the bug a few minutes ago. didn't realize it was happening. So I have to do some more research
[12:46:53] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: in both 1.3 and 1.4 there is a built in taphold event long holds
[12:47:05] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: there is?
[12:47:09] <arschmitz> yup
[12:47:15] <maxmoore14> lol
[12:47:29] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: http://api.jquerymobile.com/taphold/
[12:48:51] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: oh yeah, I completely forgot about that. I was so focused on the v-mouse events, I never looked at the tap events
[12:49:10] <maxmoore14> what's the main difference between tap and vclick?
[12:49:41] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[12:51:49] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: vclick is based around a click and will trigger on just a click event
[12:52:02] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: tap is based around mouse / touch events
[12:52:52] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: I don't really understand the difference
[12:53:11] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: in practice there is not a lot execpt in edge cases
[12:53:45] <jwmann> doug65536: Any update?
[12:54:08] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: the single biggest difference is you can have a vclick without a vmousedown first
[12:54:19] <arschmitz> you cannot have a tap with out a vmouse down first
[12:54:36] <maxmoore14> ok
[12:54:58] <doug65536> jwmann: sorry I got distracted by phone call
[12:55:37] <jwmann> doug65536: That's alright
[12:56:10] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: for my current issue, I'm thinking if I ditch my own longhold method in favor of taphold and also use tap instead of vclick on the list items, I should be better off
[12:56:44] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: I'm just wondering now if for simple link/button events, am I better off with vclick or tap?
[12:56:59] <arschmitz> its hard to say with out more details on your issue but yes i would suggest that as a place to start
[12:57:11] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: one caution with vlick
[12:57:35] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: you can end up with different targets for the vclick and the click that follows
[12:58:33] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: i strongly suggest against vclick for anything that causes on screen movment
[12:59:14] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: like links
[12:59:40] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: yes, that I've read in the docs. I guess I'm just learning the hard way!
[13:00:46] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: I'm going to try changing mostly to tap now and see how I go. last question, if you don't mind... any specific cases to avoid using tap I should watch out for?
[13:00:48] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: its a hard situation on mobile because responsiveness would dictate some sort of fast click solution like vclick but ill be the first to say all fast click solutions are buggy when it comes to targets
[13:01:10] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: nope because tap ensures the same target or it will not trigger
[13:01:49] <maxmoore14> ok, great
[13:02:01] <maxmoore14> thanks for clearing that up for me
[13:02:08] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: no problem
[13:06:15] <bakers> I want to do a <select> drop down with images instead of text. Can I do that JQueryUI
[13:07:39] <Technical_13> I believe you can.
[13:07:47] <Technical_13> But don't ask me how...
[13:10:49] <duch_kazatel> bakers - not with a native dropdown - you've have to code your own.
[13:11:33] <grafi> bakers: http://designwithpc.com/Plugins/ddSlick#demo
[13:11:48] <grafi> bakers: maybe you can use that to get started
[13:13:05] <bakers> I found some tools that do it, but if JQui does it, or something close that'd be better as I already have it installed
[13:15:42] <duch_kazatel> bakers - if you're willing to code your own, you can, but the native <select> does not support images.
[13:16:53] <Guest5948> Hi, I'm trying to get the top section of my site to compress as the user scrolls down, so the pages doesn't actually scroll down until the secion is at about 40px of height, where it will become a fixed header. How do I "bypass" the natural scrolling function, and instead make it perform a different function like shrinkSection()?
[13:27:05] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: without your coming 1.4 feature that can disable emitting taps after holds, what do you recommend to trap the tap event? Should I track whether taphold was triggered, attach a tap event and preventDefault() in the tap event if needed?
[13:27:52] <arschmitz> maxmoore14: yeah something along those lines is probably best bet for now
[13:28:07] <maxmoore14> ok, thx
[13:28:36] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: with 1.4, will it just be a global option? or will there be a way to adjust it on certain elements?
[13:28:56] <arschmitz> global
[13:30:12] <maxmoore14> ok
[13:31:25] <maxmoore14> does calling preventDefault() on a taphold do anything at all? does it prevent native browser popups for example?
[13:33:50] <arschmitz> no because taphold has no default
[13:34:03] <Roots47> Is there a jcarousel chat, or should I ask here?
[13:34:07] <arschmitz> because its not a real event
[13:34:08] <Roots47> jcarousellite*
[13:36:01] <maxmoore14> arschmitz: gotcha, that makes sense
[13:39:08] <lethjakman> hey, I thought there was an event that went off whenever you submitted some ajax, does anyone know what that's called?
[13:44:26] <DansVC> hello
[13:44:41] <DansVC> Can i have a question of html5?
[13:44:51] <DansVC> *make
[13:45:05] <DansVC> can?
[13:45:38] <DansVC> someone?
[13:46:07] <DansVC> how i delete all localstorage?
[13:46:51] <DansVC> anton?
[13:47:09] <DansVC> nobody is here :(
[13:51:21] <holywarprofiteer> what do you mean "delete all local storage"? like remove all events from the dom?
[13:54:26] <grafi> oO
[13:55:29] <fedora_newb> When you have multiple fields with the name such as answer_info[][answer], which is a textarea how do you make each one required? I am using the jquery plugin here: http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/ and each field has required as an attribute but only one shows the error.
[13:56:02] <holywarprofiteer> DansVC: localStorage.clear();
[13:56:20] <holywarprofiteer> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10710674/html5-localstorage-clear-all-data
[13:57:39] <holywarprofiteer> fedora_newb, do you have a fiddle?
[13:59:10] <fedora_newb> holywarprofiteer, its pretty dynamic but let me try to set one up. Thanks.
[14:04:14] <boytoy> Does anybody know why Trunk8 works fine in most cases (i.e. http://jsbin.com/okahum/50/edit), but if the first paragraph is just "Hi", everything goes haywire? http://jsbin.com/okahum/59/edit
[14:06:14] <fedora_newb> holywarprofiteer, its a little messy but you will get the jist of it I am sure http://jsfiddle.net/TzvDP/
[14:06:52] <boytoy> It also goes haywire if images or say YouTube embeds are present (i.e. <p>... <a class="read-more">read more</a></p> becomes <p... <a="" class="more">(more)</p...>) but for that I guess I can just use jQuery to move images and embeds to a separate div.
[14:07:05] <fedora_newb> I am wanting multiple answer fields to be required, but only one shows the error.
[14:07:11] <boytoy> Is there a better way to truncate stuff maybe?
[14:13:07] <holywarprofiteer> fedora_newb, can you simplify that, perhaps just the 2 text areas, if that's whats giving you the issue?
[14:13:51] <NoiseEee> boytoy: you're asking to truncate something that can't be truncated
[14:14:01] <holywarprofiteer> boytoy, I've never used trunc8 before, but does it have something to do with the "lines: 2" input?
[14:27:36] <boytoy> NoiseEee: ideally it'd look like this: http://jsbin.com/okahum/61/edit
[14:28:02] <joe-c> hey fols
[14:28:03] <joe-c> folks
[14:28:12] <boytoy> holywarprofiteer: it shouldnt, i dunno
[14:28:27] <joe-c> i've got a bit of ajax which adds 4 li's to a ul
[14:28:36] <joe-c> i want them to fadein, one after another, with a slight delay between them
[14:28:54] <joe-c> i thought this would do it : http://pastebin.com/z8tuQ9Np but only the last one fades in
[14:30:20] <joe-c> it's something to do with the setTimeout begin overwritten I think
[14:31:53] <holywarprofiteer> I think you would put a transition attribute on the li's parent (ul, or div maybe?), then use setTimeout with .each
[14:32:17] <holywarprofiteer> maybe multiple the timeout value by the index
[14:33:52] <holywarprofiteer> oh, I'm looking at your code now. This probly doesn;t have anything to do with it, but if you put index in as a parameter of the each function, you can use that as a counter
[14:34:22] <holywarprofiteer> so like .each(function(index){ ...
[14:34:47] <doug65536> no way - chrome started working properly...
[14:35:16] <holywarprofiteer> then you can use that in place of revealTime. or, hell you could use revealTime as the index .each(function(revealTime)
[14:35:22] <doug65536> oops wrong channel lol
[14:36:27] <holywarprofiteer> joe-c, can you make a fiddle with the html structure, I'm thinking your selectors might be wrong
[14:36:53] <joe-c> holywarprofiteer: I think it's http://brackets.clementng.me/post/24150213014/example-of-a-javascript-closure-settimeout-inside-a
[14:38:48] <holywarprofiteer> hmm. weird shit
[14:43:35] <fedora_newb> holywarprofiteer http://jsfiddle.net/TzvDP/1/
[14:44:27] <fedora_newb> holywarprofiteer, not sure why both answer fields are not coming up as required
[14:48:09] <Roots47> anyone here use jcarousellite?
[14:51:06] <joe-c> ah well thanks for your help holywarprofiteer i ended up using http://demosthenes.info/blog/630/Fade-In-Elements-Sequentially-With-JQuery-and-CSS3
[14:55:13] <fedora_newb> Guess I could always just dynamically add the numbers to the index array. That seems to work.
[15:10:57] <bklane_> Why would select2 do this to my form? http://s9.postimg.org/b2s7boza7/Screen_Shot_2013_08_20_at_6_08_50_PM.png

[16:20:35] <jsmith_> Anyone know of a good reference on draggable event for a noob? I want to populate a hidden form field as part of the droppable event, but not sure how to pass the content via the drag side
[16:37:45] <jsmith_> what's the best way to set data attributes in a jquery datatable td element?
[18:32:28] <sammych> okay, so I've a pattern that basically says 'if you're gonna refer to something, make a variable out of it' for readability and code conciseness. Eg: foo.bar -> var fbr = foo.bar
[18:32:55] <sammych> that's a contrived example, and probably not that poignant
[18:32:58] <Psybur> Would doing $('input').each() with an alert in it cause an infinite loop? Does the input button in the alert box count?
[18:33:06] <Psybur> I seem to be getting an infinite loop xD
[18:33:24] <sammych> that's definitely not an infinite loop
[18:33:29] <sammych> just a really annoying way to debug
[18:34:22] <sammych> back to my original question, to anyone reading this, and typically no one at this time: I have a bunch of calls to get a val from a series of ids and trim their values
[18:34:23] <pixelpimp> not a loop, definitely a bad way to debug.  console.log() is your friend
[18:34:58] <sammych> I'm wanna know if I should just throw that line into a local function and have it take in that id, get the value and trim and return
[18:35:17] <pixelpimp> if you're doing it often, sounds like a good idea
[18:38:02] <sammych> ahh, that feels good, getting rid of about 100 chars :)
[18:38:27] <pixelpimp> definitely a good idea
[18:46:56] <GoogleLovesYou> Learn how GM is using Dow Betamate adhesives to create environmentally sustainable transportation products.
[18:49:39] <Psybur> The following code block is looping through 100 times, any idea why? (2 lines dont freak xD)
[18:49:42] <Psybur> $(document).ready(function() {
[18:49:42] <Psybur> $('input').each(function(index) {
[18:49:58] <Psybur> Rest of code doesnt matter, its only output stuff
[18:52:26] <sammych> Psybur: instead of that each, just run console.log($('input'))
[18:52:31] <sammych> then look at the output in your console
[18:52:36] <sammych> that will be your answer
[18:54:20] <Psybur> Confirmed: Im an idiot
[18:54:21] <Psybur> xD
[19:00:06] <Psybur> Anyone have experience with spring forms? Am I wasting my time writing my own code to add new entries in a form to represent another object in a list?

[19:25:45] <drewery> Hi guys
[19:26:29] <drewery> I am wondering if anybody is online I got stuck trying to solve an issue with my code
[19:28:03] <pixelpimp> there are 767 people here
[19:29:05] <drewery> yup, and I am trying to get my code together off the page to jsfiddle to be able to share it if anybody interested in assisting
[19:29:21] <drewery> thanks pixelpimp
[19:29:41] <pixelpimp> any time
[19:29:44] <drewery> uhmm... http://jsfiddle.net/k7LUj/1/ this is the code I am struggling with.
[19:30:13] <drewery> let me put the html there too... I don't know how to get the css part sorted out from the stylesheet
[19:30:24] <pixelpimp> markup would be nice, yeah
[19:39:00] <drewery> for markup go to cgr-dev.com/envision/champions
[19:39:33] <drewery> sorry... it should be : http://cgr-dev.com/envision/individuals/
[19:40:26] <drewery> the script I posted on jsfiddle runs this small section
[19:41:27] <drewery> the problem is that I am trying to get pledge this button automatically copy the h1 and insert it in the form once you click the pledge button
[19:42:40] <drewery> problem 1 : once the script loads, it will load the first bicycle content, if I click the pledge button, it won't insert the h1 into the subject before I click one of the icons at the bottom section
[19:44:55] <drewery> the second problem is this: page loads... I click one of the icons and the content to that icon loads... I click pledge button, and the h1 title gets injected to the form subject... however... if I click go back link at the top of the form... then I choose another icon... and then pledge to its content... the h1 tag again gets injected to the subject value but it won't clear the previous value it herited...
[19:45:57] <drewery> I am looking for direction to eliminate these problems... thank you in advance...
[19:53:36] <drewery> no takes out of 700+ people? :(
[19:54:10] <drewery> or let me ask you this... how can I clear the value for an input element of a form??
[19:54:33] <drewery> change the value attribute so far .val("") is not doing it for me
[19:56:05] <drewery> and is there a way in jQuery I can trigger a click without getting the user actually click anything...
[19:56:06] <drewery> ?
[19:56:09] <ernston> your best off trying in #javascript
[19:56:18] <ernston> i am struggling to get help also
[19:56:29] <ernston> making a complete mess
[19:56:52] <ernston> tried .text("")  ?
[19:57:19] <drewery> yes, thats actually how I copied the value into an variable to be copied over and injected into an input element
[19:57:44] <ernston> $(document).ready(function() {  alert('i need help'); }
[19:57:46] <ernston> try that
[19:57:50] <ernston> should load
[19:57:55] <drewery> L)
[19:57:59] <drewery> lol
[19:58:02] <ernston> $(document).ready(function() {  alert('i need help'); });
[19:58:19] <ernston> i dunno what am meant to do next
[19:58:25] <drewery> good sense of humor!
[19:58:36] <ernston> i need it
[19:58:43] <ernston> you go mad otherwise
[19:58:53] <drewery> true
[19:59:09] <drewery> I am not mad but very curious to find out to find out how I could work this out
[19:59:22] <pixelpimp> .val('') and .attr('value', '') both work
[19:59:22] <drewery> I already spent 4 hours searching stackoverflow etc
[19:59:38] <ernston> atleast you know what your searching for
[19:59:48] <pixelpimp> it's a good looking site
[19:59:49] <drewery> what is your problem, may be I could help ?
[20:00:03] <drewery> thanks pixelpimp
[20:00:13] <pixelpimp> bit hard to debug without a fiddle or better access to the script
[20:00:41] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/117/
[20:00:53] <ernston> i am trying to get the search input + slider  to work together
[20:00:57] <ernston> filter 1 + filter 2
[20:01:02] <drewery> 117 updates... way to go
[20:01:16] <ernston> did i mention am shit at this jquery n js stuff
[20:01:31] <ernston> keep breaking the code
[20:01:35] <ernston> and having to undo pieces
[20:02:03] <drewery> do you write your code on the fly or
[20:02:08] <ernston> no
[20:02:10] <ernston> took me days
[20:02:11] <drewery> map things out first
[20:02:11] <ernston> lool
[20:02:22] <ernston> with some help
[20:03:05] <ernston> i believe, i need to adjust the $matches
[20:03:19] <ernston> but i buggered that up
[20:03:22] <ernston> so am unsure what i need
[20:04:39] <drewery> did you write the whole thing from scratch?
[20:05:01] <drewery> if you make sense of the code it might be easier to solve..
[20:05:04] <ernston> dont think so
[20:05:25] <ernston> ive been fiddling with this for awhile now
[20:05:39] <drewery> I can tell by your update numbers
[20:05:54] <drewery> thats some fiddling there
[20:07:12] <ernston> backup plan
[20:07:22] <ernston> css { display:none; }
[20:08:42] <obert> :)
[20:09:04] <drewery> lol
[20:09:06] <drewery> why not,
[20:09:08] <obert> you forgot a space
[20:09:21] <ernston> i put 2 in
[20:09:31] <drewery> I never use spaces
[20:09:31] <obert> 3 atm
[20:09:41] <ernston> i always space
[20:09:45] <obert> pff
[20:09:47] <ernston> in editor
[20:09:53] <ernston> not with jsfiddle
[20:10:03] <drewery> I only spare a space after a ':' thats it
[20:10:17] <obert> css { display:none; } == css { display: none; }
[20:10:42] <Snerf> no need for a space
[20:11:03] <ernston> i like a tab
[20:11:08] <ernston> and a return
[20:11:21] <drewery> pixelpimp, thank you but .val and .attr will only set the values for me however, somewhy won't clear the previous value for me, you are right hard to debug without a working jsfiddle copy
[20:12:02] <Snerf> drewery, what are you trying to change?
[20:12:51] <drewery> I have show/hide containers with 10+ icons every icon displays .show() a description container
[20:13:22] <drewery> every description container have this button which hides the description and shows the email form
[20:13:51] <drewery> I inject the subject value (input value="" ) from the contents h1 element
[20:14:12] <Snerf> does your <h1> have an id?
[20:14:28] <drewery> yes, see this : http://jsfiddle.net/k7LUj/5/
[20:14:35] <ernston> h1 is my id
[20:14:37] <Snerf> how are you changing it?
[20:15:36] <Snerf> you are getting it with .text(), why dont you set it with .text()?
[20:15:43] <drewery> oh... I assign a class to the active description container
[20:15:51] <drewery> so I call that class and then the h1 in it
[20:16:04] <drewery> var cgrThis = $('.activeCGR h1').text();
[20:16:06] <Snerf> .text(cgrThis)
[20:16:23] <Snerf> instead of .val(cgrThis)
[20:16:29] <T13|sleeps> Snerf?
[20:16:37] <T13|sleeps> Snitch snerf?
[20:16:46] <Snerf> T13|sleeps, huh?
[20:16:46] <drewery> ok let me try this very quick
[20:17:10] <Spami> Hello
[20:17:12] <T13|sleeps> Nevermind.  Thought you were snerk
[20:17:22] <Snerf> I dont see a k
[20:17:35] <drewery> actually value works
[20:17:40] <drewery> text won't work somewhat
[20:17:51] <drewery> I don't have problem injecting the value
[20:18:00] <T13|sleeps> 11:20pm... eyes playing tricks on me.
[20:18:02] <Spami> Is there anyway to send some data to a query function  like $('#blib').click(mydata) ?
[20:18:12] <drewery> I have a problem clearing the assigned value if the user goes back and picks another container and clicks the button again
[20:18:19] <Snerf> drewery, you never said what your problem was
[20:18:23] <drewery> I need to clear the assigned value and change it with the new one
[20:18:39] <drewery> sorry about that, I am tangled a bit here
[20:18:41] <drewery> :(
[20:19:07] <Snerf> drewery, you need to remove the class activeCGR
[20:19:37] <drewery> then how I am going to be able to choose the active container.. .there are like 10 containers displayed with .show and .hide
[20:19:52] <Snerf> $(".activeCGR").removeClass("activeCGR") .. all you need is keep adding the class.. so 2 elements will have it
[20:20:01] <drewery> they are identical and only that class tells me which container is active
[20:20:16] <Snerf> you need to remove it, you always add it
[20:20:30] <drewery> oh got it
[20:20:32] <drewery> :)))
[20:20:35] <drewery> that makes sense !
[20:20:45] <Snerf> $(".activeCGR").removeClass("activeCGR") _-- removes all instances of that class (selected items)
[20:20:55] <drewery> you are awesome man ! I didn't think about that aspect :)
[20:21:17] <Snerf> you had multiple instances of the activeCGR class, thats all :)
[20:21:33] <Snerf> no problem
[20:21:47] <drewery> no that makes perfect sense that is why there are multiple subject values adding up and why I always think .val() is not working to clear the value... makes perfect sense !
[20:21:58] <Snerf> :) cheers
[20:22:03] * Snerf gotta run for a bit
[20:22:06] <drewery> Cheers ! ! !
[20:22:10] <drewery> thanks Snerf
[20:36:06] <doug65536> Spami: yes, .on('click', null, "my data here", function() ....
[20:36:19] <drewery> one last thing : is this a correct statement ? : if ($('.icons').click()=== false) {
[20:36:28] <Spami> I actually used on
[20:36:30] <doug65536> Spami: yes, .on('click', null, "my data here", function(event) .... data is in event.data
[20:37:07] <Spami> doug65536,   the tricky part is that I use filepicker, so fp is firing the event when he is done uploading the picture
[20:38:01] <Spami> doug65536,  so I have something like this: :onchange => "$('.filepicker').trigger('custom', [event.fpfiles, event]);" but when I just put event.fpfiles i get an incomplete array
[20:40:56] <doug65536> Spami: incomplete?
[20:41:46] <ernston> anyone around to help yet drewery ?
[20:41:58] <drewery> I solved my biggest problem
[20:42:02] <Spami> yes it's supposed to send an array of at least 2 object and it only send the first object
[20:42:16] <ernston> i havent :(
[20:42:29] <drewery> there is one minor thing left but I think I can get around that one...
[20:43:02] <drewery> what is it exactly makes this a problem ernston
[20:43:03] <drewery> ?
[20:43:17] <LoneSoldier728> I am not sure what I am doing wrong here anyone notice the problem?
[20:43:18] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/89TYVqu4
[20:43:18] <drewery> I noticed the toggling when I was using the slider
[20:43:19] <doug65536> Spami: I don't see where the variable "event" is defined in that scope. I'll assume it actually exists though :)
[20:43:34] <LoneSoldier728> The script is not post-ing pictureRemove with the data...
[20:43:50] <doug65536> Spami: that's inside the onchange event handler I guess?
[20:44:30] <Spami> doug65536,  yes, pretty much, I guess file picker create it and then send it to the trigger
[20:44:58] <Spami> I also do a console.log(even.fpfiles) and the result is right
[20:45:14] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/89TYVqu4
[20:45:38] <ernston> problem is i am unable to filter a list twice
[20:45:40] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/TnDha/120/
[20:46:47] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: $(this).remove() is redundant. you already removed the parent so this is gone anyway
[20:48:12] <LoneSoldier728> thanks i removed it
[20:48:16] <LoneSoldier728> but still having the problem
[20:48:25] <LoneSoldier728> with the pictureRemove is not defined : /
[20:48:36] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: the server side ajax file has no extension?
[20:48:46] <doug65536> removeProfilePicturePost
[20:48:58] <LoneSoldier728> it does
[20:49:03] <doug65536> well, it's missing
[20:49:04] <LoneSoldier728> it POST's but the pictureRemove
[20:49:15] <LoneSoldier728> coming from jquery
[20:49:19] <LoneSoldier728> is undefined
[20:49:35] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: /removeProfilePicturePost  <- file not found
[20:50:11] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: /removeProfilePicturePost.php ? or something
[20:50:33] <ernston> n/, drewery
[20:50:37] <LoneSoldier728> using node.js
[20:50:43] <ernston> am too done in to focus

[20:50:50] <ernston> thanx for trying
[20:50:52] <LoneSoldier728> that is the error doug
[20:50:53] <ernston> nite all
[20:51:49] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/xCnxz/
[20:52:01] <LoneSoldier728> when running this it works but the pictureRemove shows up as undefined there too
[20:53:09] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: what is .removePicture?
[20:53:14] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: a button? or what
[20:53:15] <LoneSoldier728> it is the class
[20:53:16] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[20:53:20] <LoneSoldier728> of the button
[20:53:39] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: I ask because $(this) might be a parent of what caused the click
[20:54:30] <LoneSoldier728> ya so it is correct right?
[20:54:38] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: say, if it was a div with a <a> in it, and you missed the text and clicked the box, and the data is on the <a>
[20:55:22] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: it could be right sure. I can't see enough context to know
[20:55:59] <LoneSoldier728> hm let me look at one thing that might affect it
[20:56:41] <LoneSoldier728> ok one thing that I have different
[20:56:43] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: you should put $.ajaxSetup({error: function(xhr,msg) { alert("AJAX error: " + msg); });  somewhere near the start of the code
[20:56:45] <LoneSoldier728> for the other elements that work
[20:56:55] <LoneSoldier728> is the button is nested
[20:56:58] <LoneSoldier728> under the p tags
[20:57:07] <LoneSoldier728> this is an img tag, and if i nest the buttons
[20:57:13] <LoneSoldier728> they dont show up
[20:57:15] <LoneSoldier728> for some reason
[20:57:45] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: the thing with class="removePicture" doesn't have any child objects then right?
[20:57:58] <LoneSoldier728> correct
[20:58:03] <LoneSoldier728> here i will include
[20:58:06] <LoneSoldier728> the html div
[20:58:30] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/xCnxz/1/
[20:58:36] <LoneSoldier728> the html is diff now
[20:59:34] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: the console.log is nonsense. there is no variable named pictureRemove
[20:59:56] <LoneSoldier728> right I tried throwing it after the
[21:00:03] <LoneSoldier728> {} inside
[21:00:05] <LoneSoldier728> but it was not working
[21:00:15] <LoneSoldier728> I have the error still on the server side when I console.log it
[21:00:21] <LoneSoldier728> it shows as not defined
[21:00:33] <doug65536> try that: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/xCnxz/2/
[21:01:55] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[21:02:00] <LoneSoldier728> still same error
[21:02:08] <doug65536> it prints the id to console right?
[21:02:38] <LoneSoldier728> ok that is wierd
[21:02:39] <LoneSoldier728> ya it does
[21:02:42] <dkphenom> is it possible to post .ajax request to itself or does it have to be to a different file?
[21:02:58] <LoneSoldier728> so what does that mean
[21:03:12] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: ok so that is eliminated as the problem. bug must be server side. are you sure the server expects a post variable named pictureRemove ?
[21:03:15] <LoneSoldier728> am i sending pictureRemove wierd
[21:03:29] <LoneSoldier728> ya i think i just realized
[21:03:32] <LoneSoldier728> what i am doing wrong
[21:03:34] <LoneSoldier728> serverside
[21:03:40] <LoneSoldier728> it has to be req.body.pictureRemove
[21:03:41] <LoneSoldier728> ahhh
[21:03:59] <LoneSoldier728> thanks for ur help a bunch!

[23:28:37] <Whirl3d> wow pixelpimp, when people ask in a forum or chatroom like this, they aren't asking for empirical results that you can get from google, they are asking for individual recommendations based on experience not some crappy plugins ad budget
[23:31:31] <pixelpimp> although this channel might not be strictly dev only, that is like the epitome of a google>irc question
[23:33:21] <Whirl3d> perhaps you could help me:   google: What is the real-world experience of the respected members of the #jquery channel with regards to a good ticker? Or should I code my own?
[23:33:25] <Whirl3d> Not so good
[23:34:08] <Whirl3d> Or how about: of the 899 billion results, which one does pixelpimp use most often?
[23:34:30] <Whirl3d> again, not great results. It's suddenly looking more like irc > google for this context
[23:36:42] <pixelpimp> sounds like you need to learn how to google better
[23:37:12] <Whirl3d> Sounds like you feel obligated to teach people lessons in life rather than lessons about jquery
[23:37:47] <pixelpimp> if the lesson is to use the best tool for the job, sure
[23:38:03] <pixelpimp> in this case, google offers many good premade scripts with very simple search terms
[23:38:28] <Whirl3d> Sure but which ones, of the many would YOU use?
[23:38:33] <Whirl3d> and how do I google that?
[23:38:57] <Whirl3d> I actually google IRC logs for old Jquery conversations That's where someone has probably answered the qestion before
[23:39:06] <pixelpimp> i would write my own; there are many reviews from many respectable places available as well
[23:40:07] <Whirl3d> That's how I got wrapped up in Elegant Themes when I started using WordPress. lots of great reviews. Beuatiful layouts. Stunning
[23:40:48] <Whirl3d> and then in the #wordpress  channel, I found out what an idiot I was for trying to work with their totally non-conventional theme framework.
[23:41:12] <Whirl3d> I have come to really respect the personal opinions of people like yourself. You have helped me out a lot.
[23:42:06] <Whirl3d> But I don't get upset if I ask a quesiton like "which ___is best" and don't get an answer..that's the joy of IRC. If nobody wants to answer, they don't have to. And when it's quiet like tonight, why not?
[23:43:39] <Whirl3d> at least we are not #css. LOL
[23:44:17] <Whirl3d> gnite
[23:45:20] <soee> is it possible to trigger change event only if value changed (is not the same as before) ?
[23:45:37] <sammych> okay, I'm not a colours guy, so how do I get a point on a gradient between two arbitrary colours?
[23:46:11] <sammych> say I want to indicate how busy something is, I want a colour between green and red
[23:46:16] <Cork> sammych: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient#Definition :D
[23:46:19] <Cork> j/k
[23:46:31] <sammych> fine
[23:46:41] <Cork> simplest is normally to not use rgb
[23:46:53] <sammych> yeah, I'm a math guy
[23:46:55] <sammych> you got me
[23:47:07] <sammych> I'm totally facetious, so I'd have said that to myself
[23:47:29] <Cork> sammych: hsl is often a simpler way to calc gradients in code
[23:47:40] <Cork> as long as the two points is in the same spectrum at least
[23:50:54] <pixelpimp> x = 0.6; r = (r1 * x + r2 * (1 - x)); // repeat for g and b
[23:50:58] <pixelpimp> for 60% along a linear gradient
