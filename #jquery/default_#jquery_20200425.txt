[15:33:40] <kittonian> hi. I have a form that is using the parsley.js validation library and I have everything working perfectly except for one last scenario. I have posted a stripped down form with the exact issue at https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/jObmEBN and would love some assistance.
[15:42:18] <dw1> https://parsleyjs.org/doc/help.html
[15:42:22] <dw1> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[15:43:12] <dw1> wtf is parsley
[15:48:46] <kittonian> dw1, since you just posted a link to the parsley help page, I can only assume you now know what parsley is
[15:49:43] <dw1> yeah, hadnt heard of it though and would have to study docs to know how to use it
[15:49:49] * dw1 useless
[15:50:15] <dw1> i aint got time fo dat
[15:50:24] <kittonian> yeah. basically I need help writing a custom validation for this scenario
[15:51:50] <dw1> https://parsleyjs.org/doc/examples/customvalidator.html
[15:52:10] <dw1> hmm
[15:52:23] <kittonian> dw1, I have read the docs and have everything else already working. it's just this one scenario that is stumping me
[15:52:45] <kittonian> i even have two other custom validations that are working fine
[15:52:57] <kittonian> but there are no docs or references to how to setup what I'm looking to accomplish
[15:54:27] <dw1> what about like a custom validator of type boolean
[15:54:31] <dw1> https://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html#custom
[15:54:35] <dw1> and do your own jquery logic in it
[15:55:21] <dw1> if($('#series').val()=='f')) ...
[15:55:34] <dw1> return false or some shit
[15:55:40] <dw1> ( à²  ÍœÊ– à² )
[15:56:04] <dw1> if($('#series').val()=='f') && $('#seriesname')!=0) ...
[15:56:09] <kittonian> right but it has to check what's happening in real-time without resetting or submitting the form
[15:56:17] <dw1> if($('#series').val()=='f') && $('#seriesname').val()!=0) ...
[15:56:20] <dw1> yea
[16:04:50] <dw1> what about like
[16:04:51] <dw1> https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/RwWVNXd
[16:05:35] <dw1> er i did some values wrong
[16:06:05] <dw1> but yea
[16:06:48] <dw1> just a simple custom validator
[16:08:06] <dw1> somethin like that
[16:08:08] <dw1> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[16:11:56] <kittonian> hmm, thanks for that but when I click the submit button nothing happens re validation and parsley
[16:12:11] <dw1> its a bad example
[16:12:34] <kittonian> can you make it work?
[16:12:54] <dw1> i dont know if your pen ever worked to begin with
[16:12:58] <dw1> ( à²  ÍœÊ– à² )
[16:13:15] <kittonian> my pen didn't do anything on the select lists, but did work on the validation of the text field
[16:13:22] <dw1> oh
[16:13:34] <kittonian> which is exactly what I intended with my codepen as I had no idea how to do this validation match
[16:14:01] <kittonian> i was presenting an example of the situation in the hopes someone could step in and help me get this working
[16:14:05] <dw1> well for one i forgot to add parsley required i guess
[16:14:23] <dw1> idk how this lib works
[16:14:37] <dw1> just add some custom validators
[16:15:06] <dw1> kind of like my example
[16:15:08] <kittonian> if you look at my codepen, you can see how the text field is using the built in validator
[16:15:10] <dw1> but properly :p
[16:15:20] <kittonian> but it's the custom validator for this scenario that I do not know how to write
[16:15:29] <kittonian> and that's what I'm asking about re help
[16:31:14] <dw1> check it https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/RwWVNXd
[16:36:24] <dw1> only thing is it doesnt validate when change series
[16:36:31] <dw1> cuz the validation is on the other field
[16:36:33] <dw1> ðŸ¤”
[16:38:29] <dw1> maybe data-parsley-multiple="series_name" on both or something
[16:39:11] <dw1> nope
[16:42:47] <kittonian> that's perfect
[16:42:51] <kittonian> that's all I needed it to do
[16:43:15] <kittonian> the only validation is whether or not the post is part of a series and if so, the user has to select which series it's part of
[16:43:18] <kittonian> thank you
[16:44:03] <dw1> yeah it works for that but
[16:44:11] <dw1> only checks validation when seriesname changes
[16:44:15] <dw1> not when series changes
[16:44:20] <dw1> because the validations are on seriesname
[16:44:26] <dw1> so need to trigger validation of seriesname when series changes
[16:44:28] <dw1> get it
[16:44:36] <dw1> maybe some javascript
[16:44:51] <dw1> cuz i cant see a parsley way
[16:46:03] <dw1> but strange it doesnt do live validation until one submit
[16:48:44] <kittonian> i'm not sure I'm following you because it's working exactly as I intended
[16:48:54] <kittonian> it only needs to fire on seriesname
[16:48:58] <dw1> ok
[16:49:01] <kittonian> that's the whole point of the validation
[16:49:18] <dw1> yea but changing series will invalidate it so could validate then too
[16:49:25] <kittonian> seriously. thank you so much for helping me with this. now the form is all done and I can start working on the submission logic
[16:49:33] <dw1> k
[16:49:34] <dw1> np
[16:49:39] <kittonian> oh, I see what you mean
[16:49:43] <dw1> yeah
[16:49:56] <kittonian> if it errors and then I change series to Yes seriesname won't change
[16:50:00] <dw1> right
[16:50:04] <kittonian> hmmm
[16:50:36] <kittonian> how do we solve that one?
[17:00:13] <kittonian> i might have an idea
[17:00:27] <kittonian> what if we wrap it in something like $("select[name=series]").on('change', function() {
[17:00:39] <dw1> first thing i tried
[17:00:41] <dw1> doesnt trigger parsley
[17:00:45] <kittonian> hmm
[17:00:59] <dw1> even changing seriesname to another value and back
[17:01:04] <dw1> or seriesname.trigger('change')
[17:01:08] <dw1> doesnt trigger parsley
[17:01:26] <dw1> i mean $('#seriesname') of course
[17:01:59] <kittonian> if series is yes and seriesname is none and I see a parsley error and then change seriesname to a series parsley sees that in real-time and validates the field (removes the error)
[17:02:23] <dw1> yup
[17:03:38] <kittonian> it's almost like the custom validation needs a listener on #series
[17:05:34] <dw1> i found a way
[17:06:36] <dw1> refresh it
[17:07:29] <kittonian> that definitely works except for one thing
[17:07:50] <kittonian> the seriesname always errors
[17:08:21] <kittonian> the moment I select series = Yes, seriesname throws the error
[17:08:24] <kittonian> before submission
[17:08:24] <dw1> before submit yeah
[17:08:30] <dw1> :D
[17:08:47] <dw1> so need a way to detect if submitted
[17:08:52] <kittonian> yes
[17:09:03] <dw1> easy with a global var
[17:09:13] <dw1> but maybe parsley has some variable
[17:09:16] <dw1> or state
[17:09:16] <kittonian> it can work like that once the form is submitted and there's an error, but prior to submission, no errors should be thrown
[17:09:17] <dw1> to read
[17:10:45] <dw1> k even global var didnt quite work
[17:11:05] <JohnDoe2> is there a better way to listen for keypresses in an input so that SHIFT+ENTER is detected? The last keyup will always be shift, obviously, but if ( even.keyCode == 13 && event.shiftKey ) doesn't fire.
[17:13:29] <dw1> k i hacked it kittonian
[17:13:37] <kittonian> ha, love it
[17:13:47] <dw1> i just put a global var to true in one of the validations
[17:13:53] <dw1> ( à²  ÍœÊ– à² )
[17:15:33] <dw1> binding to submit() didnt work right
[17:15:52] <dw1> broke things
[17:18:47] <kittonian> so strange. i can't get it to work on the actual page, but in the codepen it works perfectly
[17:19:46] <JohnDoe2> same here
[17:20:44] <dw1> why would you do shift enter in an input other than textarea
[17:21:35] <dw1> and why would you care about shift keyup :)
[17:21:53] <dw1> hmm
[17:22:09] <kittonian> i missed your     validating=true;
[17:22:15] <kittonian> lol
[17:22:18] <kittonian> works perfectly now
[17:22:20] <dw1> cool
[17:22:26] <kittonian> again. thank you tons!!!!
[17:22:32] <dw1> yw
[17:22:36] <kittonian> have a great rest of your day. talk soon.
[17:22:40] <dw1> seeya
[18:46:36] <kittonian> dw1, you still around?
[18:50:01] <dw1> sup
[18:51:00] <kittonian> hey. thought I was done and then ran across two more things with this form
[18:51:35] <kittonian> I have a custom validator doing an if. so, if this field is filled in and another field is blank, it shows an error
[18:51:53] <kittonian> but, i need it to respect multiple values if they are entered and I've been playing with it for a while and can't get it to work
[18:52:59] <dw1> k
[18:53:09] <dw1> values in what the other field
[18:56:24] <kittonian> i just created an updated codepen to show you
[18:56:25] <kittonian> https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/jObmEBN
[18:58:09] <kittonian> i already have it working where if a user chooses an image but does not fill in either the credit or the alt it errors properly, but I need it to error on the input file box if the alt and/or the credit is filled in but not the image uploaded
[18:59:36] <kittonian> right now when you test it out, it will error properly if the credit is filled in but nothing else, but it will do nothing if the alt is filled in and nothing else
[19:00:20] <kittonian> i basically just need to be able to pass however many fields I need for the data-parsley-required-if statement
[19:00:29] <kittonian> fields = ids
[19:03:53] <kittonian> btw, I'm sure you see this already, but I am just creating a validation tag and not directly specifying any values restricted to certain fields. this way it can be a global validation tag across the form and I can use it anywhere I choose
[19:06:44] <dw1> what about just putting required
[19:07:36] <dw1> https://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html#validators
[19:08:52] <dw1> does it really matter if post_img9_credit and/or post_img9_alt have anything entered
[19:09:50] <dw1> or do you want it to be able to be blank with no image
[19:10:36] <kittonian> right, it's not a required field
[19:10:45] <kittonian> there are 9 additional images that can be uploaded to the post
[19:11:08] <kittonian> and none of them are required, but if the poster wants an image, the credit and alt need to be filled out
[19:13:02] <kittonian> I had someone test the validation to see if they found anything and they filled out the credit and alt but didn't choose an image and it didn't error, which is why I'm trying to fix that
[19:20:04] <dw1> https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/zYvwvVr
[19:21:47] <kittonian> yes, that works, but it is specific to these form elements
[19:22:07] <kittonian> I am trying to do it with a script that I don't have to modify in order to do this anywhere across the form
[19:22:20] <dw1> could just put it in a loop
[19:22:38] <kittonian> my initial example works across the form, it just doesn't accept multiple ids
[19:23:00] <kittonian> it only works for the first id mentioned in the data-parsley-required-if statement
[19:23:12] <kittonian> but I can set tons of those statements across the form without any issue
[19:23:42] <kittonian> i need it to work with only 1 id or however many ids you wish to specifiy
[19:29:09] <dw1> i dont see where required-if is defined
[19:29:13] <dw1> your custom is requiredIf
[19:29:16] <dw1> and not being called
[19:29:55] <dw1> but required-if isnt in the docs
[19:30:53] <dw1> or does requiredIf map to required-if automatically
[19:30:57] <dw1> no, it's not being called
[19:31:38] <dw1> weird
[19:34:34] <kittonian> i was confused about that too
[19:34:47] <kittonian> if you put a capital letter you specify it with a -
[19:34:55] <kittonian> so requiredIf becomes required-if
[19:35:12] <kittonian> and myValidFunction becomes my-valid-function
[19:35:38] <dw1> k but why doesnt validateMultiple: function(values) { console.log(values); put anything in console
[19:35:41] <dw1> hmm
[19:37:08] <dw1> nm
[19:40:22] <dw1> seems validateString runs multiple times
[19:40:28] <dw1> and one time it has requirement = #post_img9_credit,#post_img9_alt
[19:40:32] <dw1> so might have to parse that
[19:44:29] <kittonian> that's what I've been trying to figure out
[19:44:37] <kittonian> nothing I've done seems to work
[19:45:14] <kittonian> that validateMultiple portion is the part I added to try and get it working. I don't think it's doing anything at the moment. If you take that out, it still works
[19:45:34] <dw1> i get it
[19:52:06] <dw1> the first problem is youre using required-if for both the image and the texts
[19:52:14] <dw1> it should prob be two functions
[19:52:55] <dw1> idk
[19:53:08] <dw1> maybe not
[19:54:36] <dw1> yeah maybe, or 3 functions
[19:55:10] <dw1> because otherwise cant know when to return false
[19:55:15] <dw1> what test
[19:56:57] <kittonian> like I said, it all works just fine, except that I cannot specify multiple element IDs
[20:01:53] <dw1> looks like youre right about that
[20:01:59] <dw1> easy fix if just considering it like that
[20:02:04] <dw1> https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/xxwdZEq
[20:02:11] <dw1> just split the requirement by ,
[20:02:13] <dw1> then loop it
[20:02:19] <dw1> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[20:04:20] <kittonian> perfect!
[20:04:28] <kittonian> ok, I think this next one is the last one
[20:04:33] <dw1> lol
[20:04:36] <kittonian> and it has nothing to do with parsley
[20:04:39] <kittonian> so you'll be happy
[20:05:05] <kittonian> https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/JjYNGYW
[20:05:15] <kittonian> I need to do two things here
[20:05:36] <kittonian> 1. I need a way for the user to clear the input file box if they make a mistake and put an image in the wrong one
[20:06:06] <kittonian> 2. I need the button to start display: none; and display: initial; when a user chooses a file
[20:07:36] <kittonian> it was brought to my attention that since there are 9 different images a user can upload, if they only have one image but they accidentally use the input file for image 2 they would need to clear that out without resetting the form or losing any of their data
[20:07:59] <dw1> for the issue of "control" changing value consider https://stackoverflow.com/a/9467172
[20:08:13] <dw1> but i would probably do it without a separate function for each one
[20:10:12] <dw1> could even do it without ids prob
[20:10:29] <dw1> but you'll want 'name' for submission
[20:10:46] <dw1> maybe an array
[20:10:49] <dw1> of names
[20:11:24] <dw1> ill show you
[20:15:59] <dw1> https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/QWjvyGX
[20:16:37] <dw1> i had to look up that css +
[20:16:40] <dw1> for adjacent sibling :p
[20:17:09] <dw1> never used it before
[20:17:19] <dw1> but prob could have used .next() or .find() too
[20:17:32] <dw1> and maybe .closest() instead of prev()
[20:17:35] <dw1> for more specificity
[20:17:36] <kittonian> wow. that's a cool solution
[20:18:11] <dw1> prev could maybe be made more specific too
[20:19:54] <dw1> but not neecessary if they're always beside each other
[20:20:03] <kittonian> is there a way to do it without changing the name="" ?
[20:20:19] <dw1> you can make it whatever you want
[20:20:19] <kittonian> i'm asking because this is an application server and I am doing a lot of stuff with the name
[20:20:21] <dw1> name or id
[20:20:28] <dw1> it'll still work
[20:20:31] <kittonian> how about a custom field?
[20:20:38] <kittonian> is that possible?
[20:20:57] <dw1> what
[20:21:06] <dw1> you can add any attributes you want
[20:21:21] <kittonian> cool. i'm going to play with this but your solution is brilliant
[20:21:28] <kittonian> thank you again
[20:21:37] <dw1> np
[21:23:04] <kittonian> dw1, well, your solution works, except for one little thing. having to add the [] on to the ID breaks the parsley if you fixed
[21:26:56] <kittonian> dw1, I guess you don't actually need the []
[21:27:02] <kittonian> I just took them out and it still works
[21:27:07] <kittonian> so, nevermind, all good
[21:28:06] <kittonian> ahh, but the buttons don't popup anymore after clicking submit and parsley is validating
[21:32:54] <kittonian> dw1, showing the button to clear the input file still works after form submit, but not if parsley has shown an error on the input file. For example, if I type in the img_alt field and submit, parsley says I need to choose an image and shows the input file in red correctly. But, when I choose an image, I no longer get the button to clear the image after choosing a file
[21:36:13] <dw1> how does the html look when you inspect it when the error message is showing
[21:36:41] <dw1> i got an idea
[21:36:47] <dw1> instead of   if($(this).val()) $(this).next('button').show();
[21:37:08] <dw1> if($(this).val()) $(this).closest('form').find('button').show();
[21:37:09] <dw1> :]
[21:37:13] <dw1> no
[21:37:17] <dw1> that wont work
[21:37:18] <dw1> nm
[21:37:52] <dw1> i wonder how the html looks
[21:38:02] <kittonian> yeah, i've tested it in every way I can think of and the only time the button won't show up after choosing an image is if parsley has validated that input file and shown an error that the file doesn't exist
[21:38:25] <dw1> right click inspect
[21:38:26] <dw1> copy the html
[21:39:56] <dw1> with the error message
[21:40:05] <kittonian> <input type="file" name="post_img_main" id="post_img_main" size="25" class="inputfile parsley-error" data-parsley-required="true" data-parsley-id="33" aria-describedby="parsley-id-33">
[21:40:09] <kittonian> there's no error
[21:40:19] <kittonian> at least I don't think. let me double check.
[21:40:32] <dw1> and with the button
[21:40:39] <dw1> how does it change
[21:40:55] <kittonian> no, no console errors
[21:41:05] <dw1> with the parsley error message
[21:41:12] <dw1> how does it change the html
[21:41:18] <kittonian> it changes from showing the error and having the input file red to just going back to normal once I choose an image
[21:41:39] <dw1> but there's nothing inserted between the input and the button in the html ?
[21:41:46] <dw1> when you inspect
[21:41:59] <dw1> then prev() and next() should continue working
[21:42:04] <kittonian> it added parsley-error to the class of the input, along with the data-parsley-id="33" and aria-describeby="parsley-id-33"
[21:42:16] <dw1> it doesnt add some text outside the tag
[21:42:19] <dw1> or anything
[21:42:29] <kittonian> you're right
[21:42:30] <kittonian> <ul class="parsley-errors-list filled" id="parsley-id-33" aria-hidden="false"><li class="parsley-required">This value is required.</li></ul>
[21:42:39] <kittonian> that is inserted automatically between the input and the button
[21:43:22] <kittonian> sorry. missed that one
[21:43:37] <dw1> maybe change $(this).next('button').show(); to $(this).siblings('button').show();
[21:43:49] <kittonian> i assume parsley just sets that to display: none; when the field is validated but it leaves it in the html
[21:43:58] <dw1> but that might make all the buttons show because they're all siblings
[21:43:59] <dw1> hmm
[21:45:34] <dw1> unless you put each in its own div
[21:45:53] <kittonian> i could give all the buttons a sub-class and then we could tell the script to only focus on the next element with the sub-class
[21:46:00] <dw1> same problem
[21:46:15] <kittonian> like <button type="button" class="clearfile subclass">
[21:46:25] <dw1> can find button just as easy as a subclass
[21:46:32] <dw1> same thing
[21:46:33] <kittonian> true
[21:48:00] <kittonian> i'm just throwing out ideas here, but if $(this).next looks for the next element, is there a way to look for the next button element?
[21:48:10] <dw1> nextAll('button').first()
[21:48:35] <dw1> :)
[21:48:48] <kittonian> so $(this).nextAll('button').first.show();
[21:48:58] <dw1> first()
[21:48:58] <dw1> yes
[21:49:06] <kittonian> so $(this).nextAll('button').first().show();
[21:49:14] <dw1> yup
[21:50:09] <kittonian> well, the button does show up, but it no longer clear the input file
[21:50:20] <dw1> right
[21:50:34] <kittonian> $(this).prev().val('');
[21:50:44] <dw1> $(this).prevAll('input').val('');
[21:50:48] <kittonian> $(this).prevAll('input').val('');
[21:50:53] <kittonian> lol
[21:50:54] <dw1> $(this).prevAll('input').first().val('');
[21:50:56] <dw1> yeah
[21:52:51] <kittonian> yup, that works. now I have to figure out how to get the button to appear next to the input because it shows up perfectly prior to the parsley error, but afterwards, because it had to be set to position:absolute; it shows up on the next line next to the now hidden UL element
[21:55:11] <dw1> i guess a hack could be to do a $(this).next('ul').remove() before show
[21:56:13] <dw1> but wont help if you want the button and error at the same time
[21:57:32] <kittonian> i do not want to show the button and the error at the same time, and yes, that solution works, however the input file doesn't go back to red and show the error when the file is removed via the button
[21:58:13] <kittonian> thought I suppose since it will once again error on submit, that probably doesn't matter
[21:58:20] <dw1> then will have to position it differently i guess
[21:58:30] <kittonian> no, it works perfectly
[21:58:41] <dw1> in like a flexbox or table
[21:58:42] <dw1> maybe
[21:58:46] <dw1> instead of absolute
[21:58:51] <kittonian> even without removing the ul it didn't return to the error when the file was removed
[21:58:59] <dw1> oh
[21:59:07] <kittonian> it's all good now, because the form will show the error again on submit
[21:59:15] <dw1> â”—(-_-)â”›
[21:59:24] <kittonian> i'm trying to idiot proof this as much as possible and I think it's good at this point
[21:59:49] <kittonian> there's so much going on with this form it's ridiculous. you should see the 45 tooltips I created, including code examples for posting the article
[22:00:07] <kittonian> or the 32 buttons I created to auto-post html tags and code via js
[22:00:11] <dw1> lol
[22:00:13] <kittonian> it's quite silly
[22:00:50] <dw1> if you use name for all the form elements you can $.post('/target',$('form').serialize(),function(r){ })
[22:00:54] <dw1> simply
[22:01:20] <dw1> serialize puts all the named elements into an object
[22:01:45] <dw1> if youre doing that type of thing
[22:01:47] <dw1> ajax
[22:02:36] <kittonian> not sure I'm understanding
[22:02:42] <kittonian> why would I do that?
[22:02:57] <dw1> if youre posting via ajax its easier than collecting all the id values manually
[22:03:38] <dw1> idk what youre doing nm
[22:04:48] <kittonian> oh, gotcha. no worries. this is actually running on Zope
[22:05:02] <kittonian> so there's lots of dtml tags and variables I'm dealing with
[22:05:21] <kittonian> it's all good though. it's so great to have this validation complete
[22:05:37] <kittonian> and it's saturday night. go watch a movie or something. :)
[22:05:45] <dw1> :D
[22:05:46] <kittonian> i'm going to go sit on the couch
[22:05:56] <dw1> k bye
[22:05:56] <kittonian> good night
