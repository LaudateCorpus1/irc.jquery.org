[10:12:08] <enerel> please click on below link and see console (error flood) http://new.shinemongol.edu.mn/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0_%D1%81%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%D1%83%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C#!A6
[10:29:03] <Robdgreat> enerel: what's your jquery question?
[10:29:27] <Robdgreat> forgive my hesitation to click on an unfamiliar site
[10:29:32] <enerel> i have jquery eroor flood. i think is because i use cyrillic letters in hash
[10:29:51] <enerel> please click its no harm belive in me
[10:30:40] <enerel> otherwise I would not be asking questions here lol
[10:31:52] <Robdgreat> but you don't have cyrillic letters in the hash
[10:31:59] <Robdgreat> the hash is just !A6
[10:33:08] <enerel> oh yes, true, maybe ! is not allowed, but google says ! -is good for SOE
[10:33:10] <enerel> SEO
[10:34:15] <enerel> can you reproduce the error it says: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .accordion-header#!A6
[10:35:37] <Robdgreat> yeah
[10:38:06] <enerel> OMG i found it. theme was purchased and was not written by me.
[10:38:39] <Robdgreat> phew
[10:38:42] <enerel> http://new.shinemongol.edu.mn/js/plugins.accordions.js - in this js they search for hash and uses jquery to select the item
[10:38:53] <Robdgreat> because I didn't know what the heck was going on
[10:39:24] <enerel> beacuse the hash has #! in it it throws error i think
[10:39:44] <enerel> i mean not hashtag only !
[10:42:10] <Robdgreat> I don't know about the whole adding # willy-nilly for SEO thing
[10:42:37] <Robdgreat> *adding !

[11:40:25] <enerel> http://new.shinemongol.edu.mn/%D0%90%D1%85%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%85_%D1%81%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%D1%83%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C#A2
[12:08:08] <niklas-leosun> Hello.
[12:08:29] <niklas-leosun> This is probably not valid jQuery code, right?
[12:08:30] <niklas-leosun> jQuery('iframe').attr('src', jQuery(this).prev('.secret-iframe-sauce').attr('href') );
[12:09:39] <niklas-leosun> usually i would use a variable, but now i have several iframes that i want to change the src, each one taking its cue from its "secret-sauce-attr"
[12:10:05] <niklas-leosun> so i thought taking a "nested" approach using (this)
[12:10:17] <niklas-leosun> but somehow lost it
[12:15:51] <enerel> i want to ask question too but all experts are sleeping i guess hehe
[12:24:33] <niklas-leosun> FYI, i found a solution by logical thinking. i needed to call a function within attr().
[12:26:18] <enerel> i dont understand what are you trying to accomplish
[12:34:38] <niklas-leosun> nevermind, have to head home now. happy coding everyone!
[12:35:21] <enerel> dont leave me alone T.T
[13:03:07] <CuirPig> enerel, has someone helped you?
[22:19:42] <errorous> Hi. I've the following code https://jsfiddle.net/k3cqf2nj/3/
[22:20:18] <errorous> it works as it should, but not when I add it to WordPress. The error and notice I'm getting in console is this
[22:20:18] <errorous> jQuery.Deferred exception: Cannot read property 'getContext' of null TypeError: Cannot read property 'getContext' of null
[22:20:52] <errorous> that's a clean wp install, nothing else in it.
[22:20:56] <CuirPig> Perhaps you haven't created the canvas element that youare referencing
[22:21:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[22:21:14] <errorous> CuirPig robertmaxrees nope, it's there.
[22:21:28] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('#foobar').length); as the first line in Chart
[22:21:40] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[22:21:49] <errorous> console.log( document.getElementById( canvas_id ) ); in that very function is showing canvas
[22:22:23] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id=foobar]').length);
[22:22:27] <robertmaxrees> what does this give you?
[22:22:39] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="foobar"]').length); rather
[22:23:28] <robertmaxrees> errorous
[22:23:28] <errorous> robertmaxrees 1
[22:23:38] <robertmaxrees> using that exact selector?
[22:23:50] <errorous> yeah, just obviously changed foobar
[22:24:07] <robertmaxrees> then no clue/  the error you're getting means that the element in question doesn't exist/.
[22:24:12] <errorous> console.log( $('[id="threshold-db-hl"]').length );
[22:24:13] <robertmaxrees> so without seeing it :shrug:
[22:24:49] <errorous> robertmaxrees I can't really share page publicly, but can share it with you, if you'd like to check, of course
[22:25:14] <robertmaxrees> if you can't share it to the channel, i'd prefer you didn't share it with me at all :)
[22:25:20] <errorous> ok, noted
[22:25:30] <robertmaxrees> kind of defeats the point of the channel, to boot.
[22:25:43] <errorous> I do understand that, hence asking first :)
[22:26:42] <robertmaxrees> and this is all the code you have that replicates the bug?
[22:26:49] <robertmaxrees> like, just this on the page causes it?
[22:27:09] <CuirPig> Do you have to declare a width and height in a canvas element for it to initalize properly?
[22:27:29] <CuirPig> There is no context without dimensions, perhaps?
[22:27:49] <robertmaxrees> CuirPig then we'd see the error happening in the fiddle :)
[22:31:30] <CuirPig> try this; let ctx=document.getElementByID(canvas_id);
[22:31:49] <CuirPig> this.ctx=ctx.getContext('2d');
[22:32:52] <errorous> good idea, let me try that
[22:33:14] <CuirPig> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage
[22:34:02] <robertmaxrees> what's the difference?
[22:34:33] <CuirPig> about halfway down, just under checking for support. I am not sure but that's how the did it instead of chaining them.
[22:34:58] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  yeah, that'll be functionally identical :)
[22:37:09] <CuirPig> They always check if canvas.getContext....they never chain them. I realize they are functionally equivalent, but wondered if there was something weird about uninitialized canvas elements.
[22:38:23] <robertmaxrees> that kind of guard is often for feature detection and bad practices.
[22:39:30] <robertmaxrees> and there are no required attributes for canvas elements, so the "initialization" wouldn't be a problem here.
[22:47:55] <CuirPig> It looks like in chart.js  you don't need to return the context, you can just use the canvas element to render a chart...if that's what you are doing...maybe that would help?
[22:49:30] <CuirPig> I'm not sure I understand what the context is really. You can't draw to the canvas element without getting context, but that's not really initializing it and preparing it to be drawn on....it's just getting a context..
[22:49:45] <CuirPig> can multiple different contexts be referenced on one canvas element?
[22:50:05] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext
[22:50:38] <robertmaxrees> i see what you're asking, but what that method does isn't relevant to the problem :)
[22:51:22] <CuirPig> Sorry, didn't mean to stray off the problem. Just picking your brain while we were on the subject. thanks.
[22:51:41] <robertmaxrees> ah - if you've got questions on that, i'd head to ##javascript :)
[22:51:50] <robertmaxrees> since none of this is really jquery anyway haha
[23:13:00] <errorous> So, couldn't figure out the problem. Instead, I'm waiting for canvas element to exist, and then running my code
[23:13:22] <robertmaxrees> how are you waiting?
[23:13:27] <errorous> interval
[23:13:32] <errorous> settimeout
[23:13:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.  i wouldn't do that.  that's a great way to introduce potential issues.
[23:13:47] <errorous> setInterval
[23:13:55] <robertmaxrees> do you know what's creating the element in the first place?
[23:14:00] <errorous> robertmaxrees to be honest, at this point I don't even care.
[23:14:11] <errorous> robertmaxrees yeah, me
[23:14:20] <errorous> so, I made sure my js is in the footer
[23:14:29] <errorous> way after <canvas> is in html
[23:14:45] <robertmaxrees> and you have valid markup?
[23:14:48] <errorous> and it still, in some cases fails to read it.
[23:15:13] <errorous> yeah. I believe there's an issue with how WordPress is implementing jquery, probably related with jquery migrate
[23:15:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[23:15:26] <errorous> perhaps not
[23:15:33] <robertmaxrees> wordpress just releases $ back to the page.
[23:15:52] <robertmaxrees> via noConflict
[23:15:59] <errorous> obviously not just that
[23:16:10] <robertmaxrees> that's really all that's different.
[23:16:14] <errorous> also, they changed a bunch of stuff related to jquery in the latest few releases
[23:16:18] <errorous> not sure if you know that
[23:16:22] <robertmaxrees> link?
[23:16:51] <errorous> https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/05/updating-core-jquery-to-version-3-part-2/
[23:16:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't work with wordpress.  also: the issue you're having isn't related to jquery, unless the doc ready is firing at the wrong time, which would happen with invalid markup.
[23:17:22] <robertmaxrees> errorous that's just updating the version of jquery.
[23:17:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not modifying any jquery functionality.
[23:17:55] <errorous> I haven't said they modified jquery functionality
[23:18:13] <errorous> I'm just saying I don't know what they did, but they changed something.
[23:18:24] <robertmaxrees> then i misunderstood what you meant with what you said earlier about changing a bunch of stuff :)
[23:18:41] <robertmaxrees> either way, jquery wouldn't be the issue or culprit here.  i'd triple check to make sure your markup is valid.
[23:19:45] <errorous> anywho, this works: https://dpaste.com/FX2UCHNXN
[23:20:16] <errorous> robertmaxrees my markup is literally <canvas id="foobar"></canvas
[23:20:23] <robertmaxrees> i mean for the entire page.
[23:20:28] <robertmaxrees> not just the canvas element :)
[23:20:35] <errorous> yeah, but that is clean wp install
[23:20:36] <robertmaxrees> and that's going to create a nice memory leak.
[23:20:49] <errorous> like literally installed it and installed my code
[23:21:01] <errorous> what's gonna create memory leak?
[23:21:44] <robertmaxrees> if ( $( '#threshold-db-hl' ).length ) { - this can cause potential headaches if the element never exists.  this is one of those cases where whatever is causing the root issue is likely going to cause other issues as well.
[23:22:39] <errorous> #threshold-db-hl certainly exists on all the pages where this script is loaded
[23:22:52] <robertmaxrees> sure, so the doc ready may be firing before the doc is actually ready.
[23:23:05] <robertmaxrees> hence my suggestion to triple-check that the markup is valid.
[23:24:00] <errorous> robertmaxrees I did check it
[23:24:04] <errorous> only a few warnings
[23:24:31] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: okie.
[23:25:01] <errorous> yeah, ultimately weird
