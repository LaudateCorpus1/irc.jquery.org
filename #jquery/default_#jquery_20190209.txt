[04:52:41] <bestdesign1> hi
[04:52:46] <bestdesign1> morning
[04:53:34] <robertmaxrees> hi
[04:53:47] <bestdesign1> i got a fiddle :)
[04:53:51] <robertmaxrees> k
[04:55:39] <bestdesign1> https://jsfiddle.net/phx2vzq3/1/
[04:56:03] <bestdesign1> if is possible hm
[05:11:42] <bestdesign1> https://jsfiddle.net/da8hcebq/1/
[08:51:11] <cryptopsy> how do you deal with async .get in a for loop? its supposed to load 5 different images 1 2 3 4 5 but the incremetor n is always 5
[08:56:00] <pavonia> Wrap a `function(n){ $.get(URL with n in it); }(n)` around
[08:57:02] <pavonia> Or something similar
[09:18:42] <cryptopsy> i wrapped function (n) {} around that $.get
[09:19:09] <cryptopsy> how do i call it?
[09:21:16] <cryptopsy> i dont understand this part at the end:   }(n)
[09:24:59] <pavonia> That is the call
[09:25:50] <pavonia> It's probably best to show your code
[09:27:16] <cryptopsy> https://jsfiddle.net/Lvfu9ngd/
[09:31:17] <pavonia> I think you need extra parentheses: (function ...)(n)
[09:31:43] <cryptopsy> so i added a ( in fornt of function
[09:31:48] <cryptopsy> but i'm not sure where its pair should go
[09:32:07] <pavonia> right before the final (n)
[09:32:19] <cryptopsy> before or after the ; ?
[09:32:34] <pavonia> before (n)
[09:32:58] <pavonia> The point is to define a local function and immediately call it with n
[09:33:24] <pavonia> such that the inner function doesn't reference the outer n
[09:33:29] <cryptopsy> wow it works
[09:33:35] <cryptopsy> that's so weird, i've never seen a function use like this before
[09:34:16] <cryptopsy> so (fun) i sthe function and it is called by (n)
[09:34:26] <cryptopsy> why isn't there a ; separator between them?
[09:35:23] <pavonia> That would require a name for the function
[09:35:47] <cryptopsy> well at least it is running now, but $.get isn't behaving like i was expecting, it seems to still be generating the image tags when using this replacement line         $("#right").append("<img src=" + fpath + n + ".png>");
[09:36:53] <cryptopsy> i chose to use this $.get initiallyt o check if a file exists before attempting to create an <img>
[09:37:42] <cryptopsy> i have update the fiddle
[09:41:14] <pavonia> You get a success for all 5 images even if they don't exist on the server?
[09:41:51] <cryptopsy> it generates the silouette of an image, like when theres a broken linnk
[09:45:31] <pavonia> Might be the same problem with fpath as with n
[09:46:07] <cryptopsy> how so?
[09:46:27] <cryptopsy> fpath comes from an object of object so its not async
[09:46:36] <cryptopsy> this object is statically defined
[09:48:17] <pavonia> It fpath is local, it's out of scope when the handler is called. What does your images link to?
[09:48:38] <pavonia> I guess it something like undefined1.png
[09:51:53] <cryptopsy> the images are local images
[09:51:58] <cryptopsy> png's
[09:53:57] <pavonia> I meant in the client, what are the URLs created for them?
[09:55:42] <cryptopsy> like "/folder/1.png"
[09:56:43] <cryptopsy> err
[09:57:31] <cryptopsy> yes, i just doublechecked
[09:58:26] <cryptopsy> URLs are the same as for images that do display correctly
[09:59:37] <pavonia> So you have images with the same URLs that are broken in one place but not broken in the other? O.o
[09:59:51] <cryptopsy> yes
[10:00:08] <cryptopsy> i mean they are different URL's, but from the same loop
[10:00:22] <cryptopsy> so /folder1/1.png might exist and it creates the <img> tags as it should
[10:00:36] <cryptopsy> but if /folder2/1.png doesn't exist, i am trying to get it not to create the <img>'s
[10:01:48] <pavonia> Are you sure your server responds correctly? Do you ever get a .fail() result?
[10:02:21] <cryptopsy> hmm
[10:02:28] <cryptopsy> i swear i used to yesterday
[10:02:55] <pavonia> It's hard to see what's going on without a live example. But I have to go now anyway
[10:03:00] <pavonia> Good luck!
[10:18:32] <cryptopsy> shouldn't it fail if i gave .get() a bogus string like '123412'
[15:43:46] <fengshaun> how do I visualize what $().parents("tag") is selecting?
[15:44:06] <fengshaun> I want to play around with it, but console.log output isn't making sense
[15:44:51] <bestdesign1> yes me too
[15:49:59] <shoky_> fengshaun: you can try logging an array of the RAW dom elements instead of the wrapping jquery object.  you can do that with .get()  e.g.  console.log( $(..).parents().get() )
[15:50:14] <shoky_> or if you know there's just one,  $(..).parents()[0]
[15:50:28] <fengshaun> shoky_, thanks!
[15:51:03] <bestdesign1> fiddle
[15:52:33] <shoky_> fengshaun: and in case you're not aware, there's also a .closest('tag')  that is similar but in many cases more useful than .parents()
[15:52:57] <fengshaun> oh, I didn't know, I'll give that a shot
[15:53:10] <fengshaun> I just need to go up step above
[18:26:43] <djbozzz> Hey all -- when you create some type of biz logic layer -- do you still maintain any jQuery dependencies within your BLL, or is it all raw javascript with some other external non-DOM changing dependencies?
