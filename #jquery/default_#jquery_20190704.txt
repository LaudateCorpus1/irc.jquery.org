[10:23:22] <sioux_> Hi, when i concat html with variabel, the html lost format. If dont concat, show html formated. https://gist.github.com/rcnespoli/032f4469ea1bbdfd00b94bc1b7fd55cc
[10:23:34] <sioux_> *variable
[10:24:27] <Cork> sioux_: not a jquery error, cause the format you have isn't even supported by .html()
[10:25:02] <Cork> sioux_: also don't run code like that if you ever have user input in the variables, as that will expose you to xss
[10:25:04] <sioux_> Cork: i have changed to .append and same problem
[10:25:24] <Cork> sioux_: ya, cause you have a third party solution modifying what you work with
[10:27:35] <sioux_> Cork: how is right to not expose to XSS, and how can i pass this ? This code, just show files in same purchase. The route is protected in laravel
[10:28:09] <Cork> something like $('#get_interactions').html($('<div>', { class: 'form-row', html: $('<div>', { class: 'card', html: $('<div>', { class: 'card-header font-weight-bold', style: 'font-size: 90%', html: $('<div>', { text: 'inner moste value that should never be html' }) }) }) })
[10:28:26] <Cork> but ya.. having so much markup in js is normally a bad idea
[10:28:52] <Cork> keep the html as a <script type="text/template"> or <template> and then set the text (AS TEXT!) from js
[10:29:07] <Cork> what is the problem is html: variable
[10:29:26] <Cork> cause that means '<script></script>' is valid and will be executed
[10:30:03] <Cork> but ya, i would recommend move the html to the html file when there is so much of it
[10:30:08] <Cork> that isn't managable
[10:30:26] <Cork> (one or two elements are fine, but not big blobs...)
[10:31:06] <sioux_> Cork: About move html to the html, i need create html file and include in JS is this?
[10:31:25] <sioux_> I will read about <template> i dont know about
[10:31:32] <Cork> sioux_: you will already need an html file
[10:31:41] <Cork> as browsers don't run stray js files
[10:31:46] <Cork> just put the html there
[10:32:43] <sioux_> hm...put all div's, and just put value of variables in html, is this?
[10:32:54] <sioux_> Put all div's in html file*
[10:33:52] <Cork> ya something like var instance = $($('#template').html()); instance.find('#place').text(newText); $('#target').html(instance)
[10:34:24] <sioux_> Cork. Thank's a lot. I Hope that you have nice day ;)
[10:34:29] <Cork> that way the html stays where it is easy to read, and the js isn't filled with gigantic blobs of tagsoaps
[10:34:34] <Cork> same
[10:35:38] <sioux_> Cork: the code that i was pasted, is "gigantic blobs"? or in this length, ok ?
[10:36:11] <Cork> sioux_: you have like what.. 10? nested divs and what not in an inline string
[10:36:16] <Cork> ya, that is the blob
[10:37:09] <sioux_> Tks again ;)
[11:03:43] <sioux_> Cork: i do like this: var instance = $($('#template').html()); instance.find('#place').text(newText); $('#target').html(instance)
[11:03:53] <sioux_> it's better and simple
[11:03:56] <sioux_> tks a lot
[11:04:18] <sioux_> my:                             var instance = $($('#template_interactions').html());                            instance.find('#interaction_message').text(d.message);                            $('#result_interaction').html(instance);                            $('#template_interactions').hide();
[11:13:50] <Inazad> Hi there, I'm using a bootstrap typehead and I want to refresh the data collection when the user type in the input. How I can do this ? I've binded an event on the input (keyup) to call my request. But its fire only 1 time. How I can fire it multiple time ?
[11:29:49] <Inazad> why do I bind an event and its called onceonly ?
