[01:39:02] <danxdanx> So, I have a guessing game where you guess the year of a photo, so far I have managed to extract the photo from a dataset (csv file) online and made it random
[01:39:23] <danxdanx> How do I get all of the photos used in every round of the game and display it at the end?
[02:37:01] <undefined_bob> morning
[03:24:58] <undefined_bob> it seems like the part of the code $(".site-nav .has-sub-menu").on('mouseenter mouseleave', function (e) { is not working at all. the submenu didnt collapse to the left and is overflowing when the the window is resized. any hint how to solve it?
[03:25:01] <undefined_bob> https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/rGVdmZ
[03:30:07] <Cork> undefined_bob: you're binding mouseenter/leave on all .site-nav .has-sub-menu elements again and again every time the window is resize
[03:30:12] <Cork> that is a BAD idea
[03:30:22] <Cork> same for $('.sub-menu').removeAttr('style');
[03:30:40] <Cork> don't ever statically remove all styling from an element, it means extending the page later will be hell
[03:31:54] <undefined_bob> morning Cork thank you for that
[03:32:27] <Cork> if you want to have the menu react to dynamically added/removed elements just make it delegated to a static parent
[03:32:51] <Cork> $(static parent).on('event', 'child selector', func)
[03:34:57] <undefined_bob> can you explain a little bit further why its a bad idea? I would like to understand
[03:35:16] <Cork> undefined_bob: cause you stack the handlers ontop of each other
[03:35:29] <Cork> so first resize event you have 1 handler for each element
[03:35:37] <Cork> then 2, 3, 4 and so on
[03:35:53] <Cork> and when a window is resized you get A LOT of resize events
[03:36:06] <Cork> so you will most likely have 100+ events handlers in a matter of seconds
[03:37:19] <undefined_bob> indeed, that sound bad
[03:37:42] <Cork> and that would be times the number of elements matching the selector so... @_@
[03:38:16] <undefined_bob> puh I didnt thought about that at all
[03:38:22] <undefined_bob> *think
[03:38:34] <Cork> and .removeAttr('style') is bad cause if you say two years from now have a function highlight() { $('something').css('color', 'red'); }
[03:38:56] <Cork> well tough luck cause this script will kill that
[03:39:19] <Cork> always remove only thing you KNOW you have set
[03:39:29] <Cork> and preferably use classes, then it becomes easy to extend
[03:39:33] <undefined_bob> sounds like I should rewrite this whole part
[03:40:55] <undefined_bob> then I have to figure out which classes are set and which I need to remove
[03:40:56] <Cork> undefined_bob: i would strongly recommend reading https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[03:41:04] <Cork> undefined_bob: yup
[03:41:16] <Cork> but that should be static and fairly easy
[03:41:38] <undefined_bob> I'm not so good in jquery, tho
[03:41:51] <Cork> it isn't that much about jquery
[03:42:05] <Cork> if you somewhere add a class just build a list of the classes you can add
[03:42:19] <Cork> and then just do .removeClass('class1 class2 class3 class4') and you're done
[03:42:48] <Cork> you don't have to selectively only remove the ones that you have currently added
[03:42:54] <Cork> you can list all of the ones you might add
[03:43:10] <undefined_bob> ah thats good to know, thank you :) I hope I can figure it out
[03:43:33] <undefined_bob> seem like this whole menubar thing is a little bit too much for me
[03:43:56] <Cork> don't think so, you're just over complicating things a little
[03:44:30] <undefined_bob> yes, thats the only thing I'm really good in
[03:44:39] <Cork> lol
[03:44:54] <Cork> it's quite common when you're not familiar in a language
[03:45:23] <Cork> the more familiar you get then better you get at keeping things simple but still get it to do what you want
[03:46:05] <undefined_bob> tbh I only have a little bit more than basic experiences in programming. I have to read myself into everything and then try, which is not bad at all because I'm learning
[03:46:23] <undefined_bob> but thats why I said this menu thing could be a little bit too much
[03:46:29] <Cork> ya, and that is how i started way back :)
[03:46:40] <Cork> <-- doesn't have one minute teacher class in programming
[03:46:48] <undefined_bob> nice :)
[03:47:22] <undefined_bob> but its frustrating when you try and try for weeks and you always facing new problems
[03:47:54] <undefined_bob> and then I think someone more experienced could finish that in less than one day
[03:48:11] <undefined_bob> and not like 6 weeks and its still not working :D
[04:03:52] <impliednude> jcarousel on wrap: circular; doesn't wrap around back to the beginning. it glitches. Anyone else have this issue
[04:26:06] <Anthaas> Does anyone here use the jquery validation library that could help me?
[04:26:24] <Anthaas> the 'email' rule access aa@aa as a valid email address...
[04:39:58] <Cork> Anthaas: cause it IS a valid email address
[04:40:18] <Cork> it would be the use aa on the tld domain aa
[04:42:03] <Anthaas> Cork, Ok, what about: jkhs@kjsda which is also valid...
[04:45:03] <Nuage> 'morning
[04:46:40] <Anthaas> Hmm, even substituting whatever the library uses for the RFC standard, it still accepts sjhfdsoifs@sdifjghaofdgd as a valid email address....
[04:47:47] <undefined_bob> Anthaas: this is also valid. how can you know that its not? you are not in peoples mind to know which mail address they create. so how could someone say it valid or nah?
[04:48:27] <undefined_bob> you get what I wanna say? :)
[04:48:56] <Anthaas> I thought email addresses were identifier@domain.tld
[04:49:22] <undefined_bob> I thought you just didnt type the .tld
[04:49:31] <Anthaas> Right
[04:49:59] <Anthaas> I am entering: oajidalsdad@ajsodhaoksdjad not akdjhasodad@asdaojshda.com or whatever
[04:50:08] <Anthaas> There is no .tld but is still being accepted.
[04:50:18] <undefined_bob> that shouldnt be
[04:50:22] <Anthaas> This is my point.
[04:50:34] <Anthaas> Even the RFC standard accepts it...
[04:51:06] <undefined_bob> a friend of me wrote a nice php script to validate and filter mail address. that worked smoothly
[04:51:36] <Anthaas> Ok
[04:51:39] <Anthaas> I know why it is valid
[04:51:40] <Nuage> undefined_bob: a whole script for nothing but validating email adresses? ahah
[04:51:52] <Nuage> undefined_bob: we have built-in email validation functions in php
[04:51:53] <Anthaas> user@localserver is a valid email address
[04:52:30] <Anthaas> local domains will not have a tld, but ICANN highly discourages "dotless" email addresses.
[04:53:11] <Anthaas> Im going to have to override it, since I don't want those kinds of email addresses to be accepted.
[04:53:13] <undefined_bob> Nuage: yeah exactly. its like 6 years ago, we used that script also to validate address in our mysql db
[04:56:26] <undefined_bob> Anthaas: maybe you could split it like 'input1: indentifier@domain' 'input2: tld' apply the library to input1 and create something else for input 2
[04:59:11] <Nuage> undefined_bob: how about now? you guys still use that funny script ?
[05:04:40] <Anthaas> undefined_bob, It would be easier to use a different regex...
[05:18:34] <undefined_bob> Nuage: nah the company went broke?
[05:20:05] <Cork> Anthaas: sure same comment
[05:20:18] <Cork> the only way to validate domains today is by actually sending an email
[05:20:32] <Cork> as you can have any number of characters in a domain name
[05:20:45] <Cork> you can't validate if a domain exists through regex
[05:21:01] <Cork> cause ya jkhs@kjsda is also a valid email
[05:21:23] <undefined_bob> even without .tld?
[05:23:10] <Anthaas> undefined_bob, yes
[05:23:16] <Anthaas> undefined_bob, user@localserver
[05:23:20] <Anthaas> that is a valid email address
[05:23:27] <Anthaas> although heavily discouraged by ICANN
[05:23:31] <undefined_bob> true
[05:23:44] <Anthaas> I think Im overthinking the UX
[05:23:57] <Anthaas> Im validating the user by sending them an email - they can't get to it that is their problem...
[05:24:42] <undefined_bob> yes, like a confirmation mail
[05:38:17] <Cork> Anthaas: it isn't localserver
[05:38:34] <Cork> Anthaas: icann has moved to allowing anyone to register tlds
[05:38:44] <Cork> like ex. user@google
[05:38:54] <Cork> ^ actually exists
[05:39:18] <Cork> so you can validate things to the left of the @ but not much on the right now days
[05:39:40] <Cork> (and actually the standard allows basically anything on the left as long as it is in "")
[05:40:03] <Cork> so email validation through regex is very close to impossible to day
[05:51:16] <undefined_bob> Cork: back to my class problem, did you mean to list the classes I add in the jquery code or in the css?
[05:51:53] <Cork> undefined_bob: classes that you might add and want to remove
[05:52:03] <Cork> as in might add dynamically from code
[05:54:39] <undefined_bob> but that would be almost every class in the css code
[05:55:57] <Cork> uh
[05:56:22] <Cork> undefined_bob: if you have .addClass() in the code for the menu interaction then you might want to have it there
[05:56:31] <Cork> else you don't
[05:56:40] <undefined_bob> ahh
[05:56:44] <undefined_bob> thank you
[08:08:47] <hellyeah> is highlight js jquery?
[08:08:51] <hellyeah> op
[08:08:52] <hellyeah> s
[08:08:58] <hellyeah> yeah right
[08:09:42] <Cork> <_<?
[08:10:49] <hellyeah> highlight.js doesnt work in mobile well
[08:11:57] <Cork> for syntax highlighting?
[08:12:20] <Cork> can't say i've ever used it
[08:36:34] <undefined_bob> Cork: I added the .removeClass but when I also add the class sub-menu to $('.sub-menu').removeClass and maximize the browser again the design is broken. If I dont add the class sub-menu the design is good but the collapsed submenu (open while resized) dont close after maximize
[08:37:09] <undefined_bob> https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/eGJmjw
[08:37:13] <Cork> undefined_bob: why are you removing the class submenu?
[08:37:36] <undefined_bob> because I might add it?
[08:37:42] <Cork> dynamically?
[08:37:44] <Cork> why?
[08:37:46] <undefined_bob> no
[08:37:55] <undefined_bob> its always there, I guess
[08:38:04] <Cork> ya, and if you remove it things break so...
[08:38:31] <Cork> actually i don't get why you're not just controlling that through @media instead
[08:38:38] <Cork> it's much more reliable
[08:39:53] <undefined_bob> because I didnt understand how, when you mention it for the first time. I read about it and I get how it works but I couldn't figure out how to implement that into my existing code
[08:41:48] <Cork> sounds like you need to read up on basic css
[08:43:51] <undefined_bob> yes I need to read more about it
[08:46:15] <undefined_bob> this are the classes I add in the jq code: js has-sub-menu sub-menu sub-left. from my guess, I shouldn't remove js and sub-menu. but then the collapsed submenu dont close after maximizing
[09:05:35] <undefined_bob> I dont get it
[09:16:45] <undefined_bob> I mixed it up with Window.matchMedia() you mentioned once
[09:52:44] <reynierpm> hi there, does anyone have an idea on what could be the cause because of what a dialog isn't shown event if there is no issues with jQuery/Javascript at all and the code is being executed? It's a little hard for me provide you with an example though
[09:53:16] <Cork> reynierpm: can you find the elements in the page?
[09:53:28] <Cork> meaning the <div class="ui-dialog">... and the like?
[09:53:40] <reynierpm> Cork, yes they are there
[09:53:55] <Cork> do you have the jquery-ui css files loaded?
[09:54:24] <reynierpm> Cork, yes it's loaded
[09:55:04] <Cork> hmm, if you inspect the element do you have something forcing it to be hidden? (display: none, visibility: hidden, left: -999; or something like that)
[09:55:47] <reynierpm> Cork, `<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="advSrch" data-gridId="grid_quote"></a><div id="dialoggrid_quote" style="display: none; position: relative;"> .... </div>`
[09:56:04] <Cork> that isn't the dialog
[09:56:11] <reynierpm> Cork, it has to be hidden since it's a dialog and it's suppose to be hidden unless you click on the link
[09:56:25] <reynierpm> this one `<div id="dialoggrid_quote" style="display: none; position: relative;"> .... </div>` is the dialog
[09:56:36] <Cork> its a parent of the dialog in that case
[09:56:49] <Cork> you would have to reset the hide manually
[09:57:05] <reynierpm> Cork, the weird part here is, the first time I click on the link it works and open the dialog, 2nd time I click on the link after close the dialog, it stop working without any errors
[09:57:25] <Cork> can't really help you much more without a live example
[09:57:38] <reynierpm> Cork, let me check the differences between the default dialog and the one after the first click
[09:58:06] <reynierpm> yes, I know it's a bit harder to do this without a live example but this depend in too much that I haven't any idea in how to provide you with one
[09:58:33] <Cork> no, not harder, impossible
[09:58:53] <Cork> the help i can give you are hints and those you've got, if you need more help i need a live demo
[09:59:28] <reynierpm> let me see if I can build something for u I'll ping you back when I am done
[11:10:32] <jquery479> Can you order an $each loop before appending? Or do I have to do it after?
[11:10:54] <taplar> ?
[11:11:58] <jquery479> I am creating a table of users, when I get the information from the database it is ordering them by id. I'd like to order it by a different variable
[11:12:16] <jquery479> Could I do this before it even appends, or do I have to do it after the fact?
[11:12:28] <taplar> probably want to do it before
[11:19:51] <jquery479> Is there a way I can do that off of my command $table.append(row)? with row being my variable of what is appended?
[11:20:40] <taplar> you want to do the sort every single time you append a new row?
[11:21:01] <jquery479> yeah, so that if someone has a higher score, they will be resorted to the top
[11:21:18] <taplar> how many new rows are you appending at any given time?
[11:21:35] <jquery479> I have 3 now, but would like to cap it at 32
[11:21:55] <taplar> so in one loop you're going to be appending 32 things?
[11:22:09] <jquery479> at one point, yes
[11:22:24] <taplar> then you don't want to sort after each append.  that's will be terrible performance
[11:23:13] <jquery479> So i tried pushing to an array so I just sort the array
[11:23:34] <jquery479> here's what I'm doing right now: https://bpaste.net/show/503f741791ff
[11:24:17] <taplar> where's the loop?
[11:24:39] <jquery479> loop is to get users, it's here:
[11:24:50] <jquery479> https://bpaste.net/show/210e6850bcf2
[11:25:31] <taplar> you should use the each off of the search object, btw
[11:25:37] <taplar> $('#status-table tr').each(), not $.each($('#status-table tr'))
[11:26:24] <taplar> and I'm unclear how these two code snipplets relate to one another
[11:28:35] <jquery479> The each is checking if a user exists in the table, if their found it bypasses the append of 'me', but if not, then it appends 'me' and the other rows
[11:29:11] <taplar> that loop doesn't call the other code though
[11:29:50] <jquery479> the other code checks for if something is found
[11:29:58] <jquery479> I just didn't include it's conditionals
[11:30:04] <taplar> you said the append was in a loop
[11:32:16] <taplar> also fwiw, the each could be done with a filter instead: https://jsfiddle.net/dxL59127/
[11:33:25] <Nuage> who the heck highlighted me ?
[11:34:29] <shoky> a person replying to you?
[11:34:43] <jquery479> what's the benefit of the filter? taplar
[11:35:01] <taplar> not reinventing the wheel
[11:35:39] <jquery479> oh true
[11:36:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dxL59127/1/
[11:36:39] <taplar> in any case, i'm still not seeing how you are appending in a loop like you said you were
[11:39:08] <taplar> lol, also i just noticed you have a data-id field on your tr that you could use for your filter, rather than checking the id
[11:40:58] <jquery479> I think I may have misphrased it, but I don't recall specifically saying the append is in the each loop
[11:41:21] <taplar> "taplar
[11:41:21] <taplar> so in one loop you're going to be appending 32 things? "
[11:41:29] <taplar> "jquery479
[11:41:29] <taplar> at one point, yes "
[11:42:21] <jquery479> oops. I mean 32 things will be appended, but the each happens on load to gather the users
[11:43:19] <taplar> so in that fiddle, the logic after line 17 happens on page load/
[11:43:21] <taplar> ?
[11:44:09] <jquery479> yeah, I do all the appending on page load
[11:44:20] <taplar> that's just one append though
[11:44:53] <jquery479> I do the appending on page load*
[11:45:14] <taplar> can you show me that logic?
[11:45:57] <taplar> oh, you fixed a typo
[11:46:01] <jquery479> It's the 'if (window.location.href..) part
[11:46:17] <taplar> ok, so you are only appending once then?
[11:47:00] <jquery479> I call "$table.append(row)" once
[11:47:25] <taplar> which is a single append, with a single row
[11:48:05] <jquery479> yeah, but I think i'll want to append the rows as an array
[11:48:16] <taplar> you only have one row
[11:48:37] <jquery479> It appends 3 on the page though
[11:48:50] <taplar> the same row three times?
[11:48:56] <jquery479> nope, 3 different users
[11:49:13] <taplar> then you aren't showing me all your logic
[11:49:33] <taplar> cause if that logic is only called once, it's not going to append more than one row right htere
[11:49:36] <taplar> *there
[11:50:30] <jquery479> I have this in my app.js, but that deals with connecting on sockets
[11:50:33] <taplar> look in your console and see if you see that console log multiple times
[11:50:47] <jquery479> https://bpaste.net/show/31ff157c5cdf
[11:51:28] <taplar> is that scoreboard logic inside the addUser method?
[11:51:37] <jquery479> yes it is
[11:51:40] <taplar> lol, dude
[11:51:45] <taplar> then that's not called on page load
[11:51:57] <taplar> and it -is- being called multiple times...
[11:52:34] <jquery479> that createdEvent is being called on socket connect though
[11:52:52] <taplar> it's being invoked when you get a message from the socket, i would assume
[11:53:52] <taplar> you can go about this a few ways
[11:54:24] <taplar> is the scoreboard area preloaded with any data?
[11:54:37] <taplar> or is it only loaded from the socket stuff?
[11:55:57] <jquery479> It has some html to create the page, but shouldn't be getting anything else
[11:56:14] <taplar> so no users are loaded yet on page load
[11:56:47] <jquery479> nope it happens about a second or 2 after load
[11:56:57] <taplar> then what i would suggest is to keep on the users their ranking as a data field
[11:57:28] <taplar> and when you create a new user, you can find all the users that have a ranking higher than theirs.  then you prepend before the first one
[11:57:48] <taplar> or flip it, find all those with a ranking less than yours, and append after the last one
[11:58:02] <taplar> that way you are moving just one dom element
[11:58:14] <taplar> inserting/removing
[11:58:16] <taplar> *moving
[11:58:22] <jquery479> by create a new user, do you mean pulling a new one from the DB or adding it to this table?
[11:58:29] <taplar> to the table
[11:59:09] <taplar> var $newUser = $('<tr .....>');   $newUser.data('ranking', numberOrWhatever)
[11:59:21] <taplar> then when you go to put the new user in the table
[11:59:54] <jquery479> won't I have to store the ranking in the DB to get it?
[12:00:08] <taplar> you are doing the calculation for the ranking in that function, no?
[12:00:14] <taplar> winpct?
[12:00:14] <jquery479> yes
[12:00:30] <taplar> that's what i'm calling a ranking.  you can name it whatever, of course
[12:00:57] <jquery479> ok, so here's the issue with that
[12:01:19] <jquery479> the winpct is basically a 'batting average' how can I go about ordering those?
[12:01:46] <taplar> that's where the 'finding those with a pct > or < than the new user' comes in
[12:02:02] <taplar> empty list, no users
[12:02:05] <taplar> new user comes in
[12:02:08] <taplar> % 45
[12:02:20] <taplar> i find users with a % greater than him
[12:02:25] <taplar> none, so i just append him
[12:02:30] <taplar> new user comes in
[12:02:33] <taplar> %44
[12:02:40] <taplar> i find user with a % greater than him
[12:02:43] <jquery479> oh, let me try something, I think I'm following
[12:02:44] <taplar> found the previous guy
[12:02:50] <taplar> i prepend before that guy
[12:02:55] <taplar> they're in order
[12:03:01] <taplar> wash rinse repeat
[12:03:49] <jquery479> Would I keep my row var though?
[12:03:55] <jquery479> or is that changing to new user?
[12:04:06] <taplar> row var?
[12:04:19] <jquery479> var row = '<tr.....'
[12:04:33] <taplar> that would be the new row you are creating, so yes
[12:05:01] <taplar> but you'd want to make it a jquery object though, so you could put the winpct on it as a data element as an actual number
[12:05:26] <jquery479> you just lost me there
[12:05:26] <taplar> var row = $('<tr....');  row.data('winpct', winpct);
[12:05:49] <taplar> if you do it like that, winpct will be a number in the jquery cache
[12:06:07] <taplar> if you do it like '<tr winpct="'+ winpct +'".....'
[12:06:07] <jquery479> so instead of var row
[12:06:09] <taplar> it will be  string
[12:07:33] <jquery479> it would be var newRow = {id:"user.id", name:"user.name", score:scorepct};
[12:07:59] <taplar> no, you want to associate it with the new dom element you are making
[12:08:13] <taplar> because that is what you will be filtering on
[12:09:01] <jquery479> so I want "data-id='ranking'" added to the original part?
[12:09:14] <taplar> no
[12:09:18] <jquery479> original var row*
[12:09:24] <taplar> data-ranking="value" essentially
[12:09:37] <taplar> but doing that makes it a string.  all html attributes are strings
[12:09:55] <taplar> but if you put the data value on the dom element with jquery, it can be a number
[12:09:58] <jquery479> do I use 'value
[12:10:00] <taplar> which is what i was showing before
[12:10:01] <jquery479> or scorepct?
[12:10:14] <taplar> do i need to answer than, :)
[12:10:16] <taplar> *that
[12:10:33] <jquery479> scorepct, right?
[12:10:41] <jquery479> because I filter off that?
[12:10:47] <taplar> sure, though i thought it was winpct
[12:10:52] <taplar> but whatev
[12:11:14] <jquery479> nope, win pct is the first part, score is the final
[12:11:25] <taplar> if you put the percent on the dom element, then you can filter off of that to know what elements should be after or before your new one
[12:11:43] <taplar> so you know which ones you need to get the first() or last() of to prepend() or append() to
[12:12:14] <taplar> i'm fixing to head out though.  i'll be back later
[12:12:22] <taplar> but that's the general idea
[12:12:49] <jquery479> I don't understand filters, which is why I didn't use them earlier lol .
[12:13:07] <taplar> you have X results.  you filter them down to those that match a conditional
[12:13:29] <taplar> literally filtering them
[12:14:36] <jquery479> so  newRow = $('#status-table tr').filter(function(index) { } ?
[12:14:37] <taplar> $('.apples, .oranges, .bananas').filter(function(){ return $(this).hasClass('oranges'); }); <-- gives you just oranges
[12:15:14] <jquery479> oh I see, should I set them as a variable, then append that variable
[12:15:40] <taplar> you find all the rows, filter out those that have a percent > or < than your score
[12:16:03] <taplar> then depending upon if you did < or >, you will append or prepend to the first or last, so all their percentages stay in the correct order
[12:16:23] <taplar> "first" or "last" relative to those that you found, not all of them
[12:16:31] <jquery479> when you say "your" score, how am I going to refer to that previous score?
[12:16:46] <taplar> you have your current scorepct
[12:16:58] <taplar> all the rows you previously created have their scorepct as a data element on them
[12:17:06] <taplar> just like for the new one you are making
[12:17:35] <taplar> i seriously gotta bounce.  bbl
[13:04:13] <dimi1947>  I do not get it...how the the output of console.log is 1 since none value is chosen:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/5vxpz1pq/
[13:07:01] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 because you're selecting all of them radios and then printing out the value of the first one.
[13:07:51] <robertmaxrees> that selector is getting all the radios, not just the selected one.  make sense?
[13:08:14] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 if you want the value of the selected one, do something like : https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5vxpz1pq/1/
[13:15:58] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:yes it did occured to me what you are saying...thanks....
[13:17:45] <dimi1947> yes...but I get undefined and the value selected
[13:17:59] <dimi1947> NOT the value selected
[13:18:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:18:46] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[13:19:04] <dimi1947> get the value that is selected
[13:19:15] <dimi1947> your code does not do this
[13:19:31] <robertmaxrees> you mean get the value when one is selected?
[13:20:15] <dimi1947> one of these inputs...yes
[13:20:30] <robertmaxrees> you need an event handler for that.
[13:20:31] <blindMoe> Can anyone recommend a newish / good parallax script to use?  I have gone through about 20 and all seem to have their quirks.  Using parallax.js right now for simple background scrolling but it tends flicker a lot when scrolling
[13:23:23] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:this will do it https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/5vxpz1pq/
[13:23:35] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 huh?
[13:23:48] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 var priceshow = $('.price_show:checked').val(); this saves the value on pageload.
[13:23:52] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't magically update after that.
[13:24:24] <dimi1947> what so you mean...can you elaborate please???
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> you need an event handler...
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[13:25:56] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:38:09] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 make sense?
[13:41:01] <grapheti> I think he feel asleep.
[13:41:47] <robertmaxrees> prolly
[13:50:52] <grapheti> If you like it, then you should have put an event on it - https://jsfiddle.net/5vxpz1pq/4/
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> *event handler.
[13:51:13] <grapheti> ^
[13:51:30] <robertmaxrees> the event happens regardless of whether or not you put a listener on it.
[13:51:54] <grapheti> infinitely triggered
[13:54:11] <grapheti> Should make a song about this for your band.
[13:54:15] <grapheti> Could be similar to this - https://youtu.be/5AxwaszFbDw?t=17s
[13:55:55] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:56:00] <grapheti> :D
[14:11:21] <grapheti> taplar, you're not allowed in here
[14:11:42] <taplar> awww
[14:12:05] <grapheti> Alright, I'll let it slide.
[14:12:09] <grapheti> Go ahead.
[14:12:21] <taplar> i'll give you some of my salmon
[14:12:26] <grapheti> oooo
[14:12:30] <grapheti> that sounds good
[14:12:36] <grapheti> I'll get the honey
[14:12:44] <taplar> honey on fish?
[14:12:52] <grapheti> honey salmon is gr8
[14:12:59] <taplar> >.>
[14:13:11] <grapheti> pretty common too
[14:13:17] <grapheti> https://www.google.com/search?q=honey+salmon+baked&oq=honey+salmon&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.3902j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[14:13:25] <taplar> i couldn't say.  i'm not much of a fish guy
[14:13:45] <taplar> interesting
[14:13:47] <grapheti> Well, I like shrimp, lobster, and crab.
[14:14:01] <grapheti> Haven't tried a lot in the fish realm.
[14:14:39] <taplar> i'm your typical red meat, typically tuna guy.  but they throw out salmon here in our bistro
[14:14:51] <grapheti> nice
[14:16:26] <taplar> did anyone happen to help the guy earlier who was asking about ordering table rows?
[14:16:50] <taplar> jquery479
[14:17:59] <grapheti> he left I think :/
[14:40:03] <taplar> i'm playing around with a site idea
[14:40:54] <taplar> i'm thinking about doing a little app that on load pulls a manifest file to know what further script files it needs to get.
[14:42:57] <taplar> i was looking more at some head requests and saw that they can return the last modified date for files and I thought, oooh, built in versioning control right there
[14:43:44] * taplar rambles
[14:43:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't guarantee that the last modified is necessarily accurate tho.
[14:44:10] <taplar> i'm not really after accuracy.  just a difference
[14:44:17] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[14:47:07] <taplar> i'm still trying to coax myself out of that weird ideas phase and into the actually trying stuff phase, lol
[14:47:55] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:48:11] <taplar> just sooo many distractions
[14:59:38] <grapheti> gotta execute those hyperbole ideas
[15:00:40] * taplar is laughing cause he said that word as 'hyper-bowl'
[15:02:01] <taplar> but yeah
[15:02:32] <taplar> i actually messaged the site that it's going to be a fan site for and they actually gave me some of their statistics, which I thought was super nice of them
[15:13:02] <hellyeah> what is hyper-bowl?
[15:14:09] <taplar> a bad pronunciation of hyperbole
[15:14:25] <hellyeah> i dont know jyperbole either :/
[15:14:36] * hellyeah jyperbole
[15:14:43] * hellyeah damn it typos
[15:15:00] <taplar> http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hyperbole?s=t
[15:15:31] <hellyeah> thanks taplar :D
[15:19:11] <grapheti> yeah, it's just exaggerating something
[15:20:54] <grapheti> sweet, already got a leg up then :D
[15:21:41] <taplar> just gotta commit to the wiz
[15:48:42] <grapheti> http://geekprank.com/
[17:32:50] <Tcalp> Hey guys
[17:33:24] <robertmaxrees> hello
[17:34:13] <Tcalp> I'm trying to animate a button that submits a form via AJAX on success
[17:34:14] <Tcalp> https://pastebin.com/64H1RGK7
[17:34:45] <Tcalp> essentially that it flashes green and back to blue (on bootstrap), and changes the 'loading' icon to a 'checkmark'
[17:35:00] <Tcalp> everything works fine except the icon change-over
[17:35:59] <robertmaxrees> what happens with the icon swap?
[17:36:50] <Tcalp> it all happens immediately
[17:37:01] <Tcalp> the color flash is timed properly
[17:37:54] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah, because addClass and removeClass don't use the animation queue
[17:38:20] <Tcalp> right
[17:38:50] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/queue/
[17:39:10] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, iirc the animation methods return a deferred so you can chain .then() from them.
[17:46:12] <Tcalp> I did : http://puu.sh/xD3Iq/b5e1245603.png
[17:46:23] <Tcalp> but told then then isn't a function
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/promise/
[17:51:33] <Tcalp> thanks guys, promise working
[17:51:38] <Tcalp> appriciate the help
[20:47:38] <poboy> going through the beginner jquery course on Pluralsight.com and some of these videos are like "in jquery 1.6 we added this"
[21:00:28] <drej> heh
