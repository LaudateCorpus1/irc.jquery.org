[00:25:11] <lemonsparrow> need help with this issue https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6208790
[00:31:34] <pixelpimp> looks like a lot of very custom things might make that difficult to debug
[00:31:43] <pixelpimp> no DOM to look at does not help
[00:32:17] <pixelpimp> this is also written pretty poorly - you should make use of classes, not set individual CSS properties so often
[00:32:38] <lemonsparrow> there's some discrepancy in the logic I guess.. hope you got the issue I am facing  pixelpimp
[00:32:45] <pixelpimp> i really don't
[00:32:49] <pixelpimp> a live view might help
[00:34:55] <lemonsparrow> pixelpimp: Its difficult to give a live view... there's so much of code...
[00:35:36] <pixelpimp> Well I'm not sure your problem lies in the code you provided
[00:35:51] <pixelpimp> It very well might, but I have no idea what you're trying to do with about 90% of this
[00:36:10] <pixelpimp> This is essentially impossible to read
[00:36:36] <pixelpimp> Not sure what all this CSS is supposed to be doing, why you're delaying things by 250ms, etc
[00:38:13] <lemonsparrow> pixelpimp: I have 4 tabs in total and the script u see is in the html.. it focuses on the first tab on load... and when I click on other tabs.. remaning tabs is hidden.. that the logic written in that code
[00:38:37] <pixelpimp> I don't know what you mean by "focus"
[00:39:16] <pixelpimp> hell, I don't even know what you mean by tabs here.  without. a. live. example.
[00:40:34] <pixelpimp> for all i know, your jquery is flawless here
[00:42:08] <lemonsparrow> pixelpimp: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/SQWQ6/
[00:43:14] <pixelpimp> Do you even understand why he gave you that link?
[00:43:22] <pixelpimp> I am in #javascript as well
[00:43:29] <pixelpimp> ##, rather
[00:43:53] <lemonsparrow> pixelpimp: he showed me a better way to do it
[00:44:13] <pixelpimp> agreed
[00:44:28] <pixelpimp> but look how simple that is to read -- no crazy CSS no one can understand
[00:44:35] <pixelpimp> there is markup AND code
[00:44:51] <pixelpimp> no 20 lines altering 1px padding on who knows what
[01:07:17] <Successful> Hi, i am using datebox plugin for JQmobile i my sulution, i tried to create a new addon ( http://jsbin.com/uwifir/1/ ) but when i use this and clicks "VÃ¤lj datum" it also triggers the link underneath the "popup". Wye is that?
[01:09:47] <noregret> I have a main div with several divs inside, how can I remove the child divs except the first eleent?
[01:13:28] <lenswipee> $('.mainDiv div').foreach(){ if ( $(this).class() != 'firstDiv') $(this).remove(); };
[01:14:21] <lenswipee> noregret: $('div.mainDiv div').foreach(){ if ( $(this).class() != 'firstDiv') $(this).remove(); };
[01:14:26] <lenswipee> !foreach()
[01:14:42] <lenswipee> ?foreach()
[01:17:28] <pixelpimp> .eq() would be better
[01:17:38] <pixelpimp> than checking class name, that is
[01:17:59] <pixelpimp> having a class name of 'firstDiv' is just about as wrong as you could possibly get in HTML and CSS
[01:18:21] <pixelpimp> because a) you can find it's the first other ways b) who cares if it's a div, it's a class name
[01:20:03] <Cork> well a simple elm.children().eq(0).nextAll().remove() should do it
[01:20:29] <noregret> cool, i'll try that Cork
[01:21:06] <pixelpimp> Agreed, that is a much better approach
[01:29:03] <sammych> alright, who wants to tell me how to force TinyMCE to not use AMD to load up resources?
[01:32:38] <amirite> AMD is the worst thing every
[01:32:40] <amirite> ever*
[01:39:02] <nisseni> I'm running a script in a for loop - the script should get the id from a hidden input in the loop, so basically the id changes in each loop, however, it seems like it sets the id of the first loop as the global one, using the value on all javascripts, how can I get around this?
[01:39:21] <nisseni> while loop*
[01:39:24] <Lucky--> amirite: no its not
[01:39:35] <Lucky--> you must not have any concept of how to use it
[01:42:16] <noregret> how can I uncheck a radio button? attr('checked', false) didn't work out, neither .val('')..
[01:43:10] <SargoDarya> since when can you uncheck a radio button?
[01:43:53] <noregret> SargoDarya: deselect it ie
[01:44:13] <noregret> reset it
[01:44:15] <SargoDarya> noregret: prop('checked', false)
[01:44:40] <noregret> thanks
[01:45:12] <Cork> ?p @ nisseni
[01:45:25] <Cork> nisseni: could you paste your code in jsfiddle.net ?
[01:45:30] <SargoDarya> although you really shouldn't uncheck radio buttons.
[01:45:38] <SargoDarya> use checkboxes instead
[01:45:58] <noregret> SargoDarya: it's just for resetting a form
[01:46:09] <Cork> noregret: why not just form.reset() ?
[01:47:43] <noregret> Cork: well, tried that, but i get an error that reset() doesn't exist or something like thta
[01:48:03] <Cork> noregret: $('form')[0].reset()
[01:48:11] <Cork> it's a dom function not a jquery one
[01:48:35] <noregret> oh, nice, didn't know that, thanks
[01:49:26] <zeropx> Anyone suggest a good article on jQuery TDD? I want to start bettering my practices and development.
[01:49:40] <noregret> i still don't quite understand what [0] does.. eg $()[0].. i mean why is it considered as an array even if there is one match..
[01:49:44] <Kingsy> is it bad to include jquery mobile on every page? or should I test to see if its a mobile browser before I include it?
[01:51:13] <Cork> noregret: $('somehting') creates a jquery array like object of dom elements
[01:51:37] <Cork> noregret: jqobj[0] grabs the first dom element from that array, so you run straight on the dom element
[01:51:55] <Cork> noregret: another example is $(this)[0] === this
[01:52:25] <nisseni> Cork: nvm, fixed it
[01:53:08] <noregret> Cork: I see, thanks
[02:01:56] <DHowett> Regarding common practice: Is it expected that functions take jquery objects in preference to raw elements? In addition, and I'm sure this was covered somewhere I mised - why is 'this' referred to as $(this) despite that it's already a jquery object?
[02:02:36] <Cork> DHowett: no this is normally NOT a jquery object
[02:02:46] <DHowett> ah!
[02:02:47] <Cork> this is the raw dom element the event happened on
[02:02:57] <Cork> and $(this) wraps to a jquery object
[02:03:05] <DHowett> ah, i mean in the case of functions added via extend.
[02:03:31] <Cork> it is up to the extension then, but noramlly it's the dom element
[02:04:05] <DHowett> then I assume the same is expected of parameters?
[02:05:02] <Cork> depends
[02:05:20] <Cork> there it is of more interest what you use most
[02:05:28] <lemonsparrow> need help with this strage issue I am facing https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/42f4391e1f030f349de1
[02:05:47] <Cork> if you use the dom element more then rarely send the dom element
[02:05:57] <Cork> else you might just as well send the jquery object
[02:06:09] <lemonsparrow> I have this method showtab() to maintain tab order... but I am having to setTimeout for maintaining the tab order..
[02:06:17] <DHowett> Cork: outstanding. thanks so much
[02:06:20] <Cork> DHowett: and if you need a set of dom elements, you should more or less always use jquery objects (if you use jquery that is)
[02:06:53] <DHowett> oh, you've solved the 'X' half of my secret 'XY problem'
[02:07:00] <DHowett> (which I didn't until now realize I had)
[02:07:02] <DHowett> thanks!
[02:07:06] <Cork> XD
[02:08:00] <iber> hi folks, is there a "native" way to select an element from a list of elements without looping i.e. $("input, select").find('select')?
[02:08:16] <iber> i hope you get what i mean
[02:08:31] <AdamPDotty> select by what criteria?
[02:08:36] <iber> by element type
[02:08:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork: need help mate
[02:08:50] <iber> so I've got $("input, select, text area")
[02:08:52] <AdamPDotty> here is a find()
[02:08:52] <Cork> iber: .filter()
[02:08:54] <iber> ah
[02:08:57] <iber> brilliant
[02:08:58] <iber> thanks!
[02:09:05] <AdamPDotty> ah, but find is children
[02:11:44] <Kingsy> oh well, I heard to bind vclick events rather than click events on mobile browsers but that doesnt work at all.
[02:13:50] <Kingsy> hmmmm I don't like jquery mobile, doesnt seem to work for me
[02:14:24] <AdamPDotty> lemmonsparrow: you go document.ready?
[02:14:27] <AdamPDotty> t
[02:23:23] <Kingsy> ok, this is really annoying, is there a full proof way to bind a click event on mobile devices?
[02:23:32] <Kingsy> it seems to work "somtimes"
[02:23:39] <Kingsy> sometimes*
[02:23:49] <SargoDarya> Kingsy: touch or touchend
[02:24:13] <Kingsy> SargoDarya: are they jquery mobile events? or just regular jquery?
[02:24:15] <seutje> binding click always works for me, if I wanna eliminate the 200ms delay, I usually use Hammer and bind to tap as well
[02:24:49] <Kingsy> seutje: it seems to be totally random if it works or not, some elements are better at responding than others.
[02:24:51] <SargoDarya> click is kinda weird because if an element has a css hover it will usually activate the hover first and then you need to click again to trigger the jquery click
[02:25:25] <Kingsy> SargoDarya: so use touch?
[02:26:08] <Kingsy> looks like thats jquery mobile :(
[02:26:59] <SargoDarya> we bound to touchend, that works always
[02:27:04] <SargoDarya> although it isn't nice
[02:27:15] <Kingsy> SargoDarya: how do you include jquerymobile?
[02:27:20] <SargoDarya> because if you lift the finger while scrolling over the element it will select it.
[02:27:31] <SargoDarya> touchstart/end are in jquery w/o mobile
[02:28:54] <Kingsy> SargoDarya: well, touchend function doesnt resolve in my ide
[02:29:18] <SargoDarya> try it with on('touchend', function() {});
[02:30:20] <Kingsy> I am testing with an android emulator here, so I guess thats a problem
[02:38:33] <notdan> Hi! I was wondering how can I select a child of a div that has a specific tag? I tried doing mydiv.children("svg"), but it doesn't seem to work
[02:39:44] <Cork> notdan: is the svg tag a direct child?
[02:40:08] <Cork> else you want to use .find()
[02:48:09] <sunbeam> .row inside another .row in bootstrap, is this okay?
[02:50:17] <xec> sunbeam: what does that have to do with jquery?
[02:51:10] <xec> sunbeam: try ##twitter-bootstrap (iirc)
[02:52:20] <sunbeam> xec: nobody there last days
[02:52:28] <sunbeam> or even last weeks
[02:53:32] <xec> sunbeam: that still doesn't make your question relevant here, also; alis just told me there's 141 clients connected.
[02:53:52] <xec> if there's nobody there, maybe you got the channel name wrong
[02:56:45] <notdan> Cork: yes, it's a direct child. The result of .children("svg") is the same as .children("button") and .children()
[02:57:12] <Cork> notdan: ok, so what exactly is it your trying to do?
[02:58:02] <notdan> I am trying to reszie the svg by pressing a button in the current div
[02:58:12] <notdan> but I don't know the id of svg beforehand
[02:59:16] <jnhghy> I need help with a .focusout(), I have a simple script: $("#aux_0").focusout(function() { alert("123"); }); I've tested it in http://jsbin.com/ and it works fine but in my page it doesn't, the js code after this function works as well so it doesn't seem to be caused by a js error. the text input is disabled at page start can this cause the error?
[02:59:41] <Cork> notdan: so you want something like $(this).closest('div').find('svg') ? (this is the button)
[03:00:26] <CrysAk> any helpw ith this error please? (error on line.1) http://pastie.org/private/9otimmwbwzmz1e0dx6ilmg
[03:00:32] <Cork> jnhghy: what is "the error"?
[03:00:38] <CrysAk> can;t seem to make my fancybox close after the ajax
[03:00:46] <jnhghy> Cork: the alert doesn't come up
[03:01:16] <notdan> Cork: I'll try that, thanks
[03:01:22] <Cork> jnhghy: what is console.log($("#aux_0").length) (add it before the focusout line)
[03:02:31] <Cork> CrysAk: the error means that $.fancybox doens't exist
[03:02:39] <Cork> so make sure you have fancybox loaded
[03:03:14] <CrysAk> Cork, strange, fancybox is open.. oo.. wait .. think i understand..
[03:04:04] <CrysAk> Cork, well.. it's on screen.. wait.. :/ .. hmm
[03:04:15] <jnhghy> Cork: it says: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined. I'm using jquery from google with this: <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script> what should I change?
[03:06:29] <xec> CrysAk: well, the error suggests that there is no fancybox loaded
[03:06:41] <xec> CrysAk: do you have a live site where this is happening?
[03:06:50] <CrysAk> xec, the fancybox is onscreen, in fact this is from a button from within a fancybox popup :((
[03:07:11] <CrysAk> yea but testserver is not wroking properly atm, (can't login, so can;t post images for issue)
[03:07:56] <Cork> jnhghy: make sure it is loaded before you try to use it
[03:08:27] <CrysAk> xec, Cork the .close works IF i put it before the $.ajax
[03:08:49] <Cork> O_o
[03:09:18] <Cork> that... makes no sence
[03:09:25] <xec> i agree
[03:09:48] <xec> maybe $ changes in the time between?
[03:09:48] <CrysAk> um.. if i move line ... 12 to line 6
[03:10:35] <Cork> CrysAk: the problem isn't with your explonation
[03:10:58] <xec> expanation*?
[03:11:14] <CrysAk> guy here is having same issue too :( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12365388/closing-fancybox-after-an-ajax-call
[03:11:18] <xec> doh, explanation*
[03:11:18] <Cork> opps
[03:11:44] <xec> misspelled the correction. shame.
[03:12:05] <jnhghy> Cork: fixed the last issue, back to alert box not showing, the console.log($("#aux_0").length) comes up as 0
[03:12:31] <Cork> jnhghy: so $("#aux_0") doesn't match anything when the code runs
[03:13:59] <jnhghy> Cork: might it be caused by the fact that the input is disabled? is a default behavior not to match disabled elements?
[03:14:02] <xec> CrysAk: what happens if you put the close() call in a settimeout of like a second or two, instead of inside the ajax?
[03:14:34] <CrysAk> xec, new to this :S how would you write that?
[03:14:38] <CrysAk> never used timeout before
[03:14:46] <Cork> jnhghy: no, where are you running this code?
[03:14:53] <xec> CrysAk: setTimeout(function(){ $.fancybox.close() });
[03:15:02] <xec> CrysAk:sorry;  setTimeout(function(){ $.fancybox.close() }, 2000);
[03:15:06] <jnhghy> Cork: the code is run in the header
[03:15:15] <CrysAk> thansk xec :)
[03:15:34] <Cork> jnhghy: without domready around it?
[03:15:50] <jnhghy> Cork: correct
[03:15:52] <sunbeam> xec: nobody just answres :)
[03:16:06] <Cork> jnhghy: there's your problem then
[03:16:12] <sunbeam> but you're right of course xec
[03:16:27] <steveccc> are there any new jquery video podcasts - I notice that query for designers isn't updated any more
[03:17:57] <jnhghy> Cork: I've added document.ready to console and I get: Uncaught TypeError: Object #aux_0 has no method 'focusout' so it finds the element...but I don't understand why it has no focusout method
[03:17:58] <CrysAk> xec still ntohing.. only works if i put fancybox close before the even.preventDefault.. perhaps that is clashing.. i'l assign a more unique name
[03:19:06] <CrysAk> nope.. niothing :(
[03:19:08] <Cork> jnhghy: try $(document).ready(function() { $('#aux_o').focusout(function() { alert('out'); }); });
[03:19:34] <CrysAk>  event.preventDefault(); is stopping $.fancybox.close(); from being called
[03:19:44] <Cork> jnhghy: if that gives you the same error make sure, you aren't using something that conflict with jquery
[03:20:28] <jnhghy> Cork: now it works, thank you very much for your help and time.
[03:21:42] <Cork> np
[03:22:28] <xec> CrysAk: i thought you said it worked on line 6
[03:22:38] <xec> CrysAk: which is after preventDefault
[03:23:23] <xec> CrysAk: does it fail if you change the timeout to 1ms? (instead of 2000)
[03:25:12] <CrysAk> xec yea, my mistake 1 sec
[03:25:58] <CrysAk> xec the reason i want it after the event.preventDefault() is because i need to make sure it grabs the deta before destroying it and if the server is slow for whatever reason a timeout won't work for me .. i'l try moving hte prevent default
[03:26:14] <xec> i'm confused
[03:26:34] <steveccc> does anyone know how close an nfc tag needs to be to the back of the phone to detect it. Would a case stop nfc working?
[03:26:45] <xec> CrysAk: did it or did it not close the fancybox when you called close() on line 6?
[03:26:51] <CrysAk> xec no
[03:27:14] <xec> CrysAk: but it works on line 4?
[03:27:29] <CrysAk> my mistake, i meant line 4
[03:27:33] <xec> what
[03:27:35] <CrysAk> yes
[03:27:54] <xec> so preventDefault has nothing to do with it, then. right?
[03:29:00] <xec> i don't know what your "yes" is referring to. be specific
[03:29:20] <Cork> xec: if fancybox checks event.defaultPrevented it could cause this
[03:29:50] <CrysAk> if i trigger the close before the preventdefault it works, if after, it doesnt work
[03:30:45] <xec> Cork: that seems extremely unlikely imo
[03:31:13] <seutje> iono, the name implies some fanciness
[03:31:24] <xec> lol
[03:32:14] <CrysAk> it's strange... when i view page source i can;t see the jquery, but it does run :/
[03:32:29] <myeagleflies> hi
[03:32:33] <seutje> fancybox source doesn't contain "defaultprevented"
[03:32:42] <myeagleflies> could someone take a look at my code and tell me why it does not work?
[03:32:45] <myeagleflies> http://pastebin.com/PxLAYKe3
[03:33:02] <CrysAk> i appricate the help guys but i think i'l hold on it for now until the test server si working then we can debug it asier :)
[03:33:37] <seutje> myeagleflies: it's a jpg and you're telling it to accept only png?
[03:34:17] <myeagleflies> good spot, but I tried with png before too
[03:34:24] <myeagleflies> I do not think this format matters
[03:34:40] <myeagleflies> I changed to jpg because I wanted smaller file
[03:34:48] <myeagleflies> so base64 line would be smaller
[03:35:04] <xec> CrysAk: can you reproduce the issue in a demo?
[03:35:31] <CrysAk> xec, only on the live server which .. for obviouose reasons i don;t want 2 3 people posting images replicating hte bug every 2 minutes lol
[03:35:40] <CrysAk> xec i'l get my test server working by tomorrow and pop back :)
[03:36:13] <xec> CrysAk: if you have a small test case it's a lot easier to pinpoint possible causes
[03:36:42] <xec> you might even find the error yourself while making the demo
[03:36:54] <CrysAk> www.driveaddiction.com unforuntately this error ivolves posting content visible to EVERYONE on the main page lol
[03:37:17] <myeagleflies> seutje: any other thoughts?
[03:37:24] <CrysAk> i have a bunch of other errors to fix too so i'l jsut wait for the test server for now :)
[03:37:44] <xec> no it doesn't - i mean, you already know it has nothing to do with the ajax call, right? can't you just make a small test case with fancybox and a button and nothing else?
[03:38:56] <CrysAk> unfortunately giving the issue, it;s very unique situation, so i can;t quickly replicate it
[03:44:57] <xec> CrysAk: i tried making a demo but i can't even get a close button to work =( http://jsfiddle.net/5wHg6/
[03:46:16] <CrysAk> xec :(
[03:46:23] <lunagiovy> Quit
[03:46:26] <CrysAk> wokring swihtout prevent default though?
[03:46:34] <CrysAk> is there an alternative to preventdefault?
[03:46:37] <xec> CrysAk: no, look at the click
[03:46:44] <xec> CrysAk: all it should do is close, but no go
[03:46:56] <CrysAk> oh.. ha
[03:47:24] <xec> with newer versions of jquery it won't open either :P
[03:48:05] <xec> what version of the plugin and jquery are you using?
[03:48:05] <xec> CrysAk ^
[03:48:05] <CrysAk> um.. 1 sec
[03:48:26] <CrysAk> 2.1.4 (Thu, 10 Jan 2013)
[03:48:42] <CrysAk> that's fancybox
[03:48:57] <CrysAk> jqeruy v1.7.2
[03:50:01] <xec> CrysAk: here's a demo with the same versions, seems to work fine http://jsfiddle.net/5wHg6/1/
[03:50:47] <CrysAk> ahhh!!!
[03:51:39] <CrysAk> www.driveaddiction.com if you want to try and work your debug magic, will need to create an account and then login / upload an image then edit it;s title/descriptiona dn click the submit button .. it SHOULD change the file sdetails on the database table AND close the fancybox
[03:52:06] <CrysAk> am hesitant to test live atm as i have no admin tools :S
[03:52:20] <xec> i'm not going to do all that, you need to boil down the issue further
[03:52:28] <CrysAk> xec lol fair enough ^^
[03:52:37] <xec> make a small test case that shows the error
[03:52:40] <CrysAk> the details i provided are what i have currently boiloed it down to :(
[03:52:55] <xec> but clearly there are more relevant details
[03:53:14] <xec> as the demo actually works, with or without the preventDefault
[03:53:33] <CrysAk> yes i know :) that's why i;m waiting on my test server to be fixed so i can test this in a better environment
[04:04:07] <Successful> Hi, i am using datebox plugin for JQmobile i my sulution, i tried to create a new addon ( http://jsbin.com/uwifir/1/ ) but when i use this and clicks "VÃ¤lj datum" it also triggers the link underneath the "popup". Wye is that?
[04:11:43] <xec> Successful: do you have a live demo we could look at?
[04:16:51] <EdwardIII> hey, i'm upgrading a site's jquery-ui. it uses a dialog which worked fine before, but now the overlay doens't seem to take up full height?
[04:17:13] <EdwardIII> the overlay has height:100%, body and html both also have height:100%

[04:32:11] <sysdef> are comata allowed in an id? eg. var foo = $('#1,0,1').val();
[04:32:53] <sysdef> i guess they are but i get strage effects :z
[04:33:02] <xec> sysdef: yes and no. i believe you can have just about anything in an ID tag but you can't select it like that
[04:33:25] <xec> s/tag/attribute
[04:33:45] <xec> i'm not sure even "#1" would work
[04:33:51] <xec> it doesn't in css anyway
[04:35:45] <xec> sysdef: $("[id=1\\,0\\,1]") would work, I think
[04:36:51] <xec> sysdef: looks like $("#1\\,0\\,1") works too http://jsfiddle.net/LYGYv/1/
[04:37:57] <xec> sysdef: also, compare CSS http://jsfiddle.net/LYGYv/2/
[04:38:27] <sysdef> i got the div content with var source = event.target || event.srcElement; var foo = source.textContent;
[04:38:52] <xec> lol
[04:38:53] <sysdef> xec: i'm just new to that DOM thingy :s
[04:39:02] <xec> what about $(this).text() ?
[04:39:33] <xec> assuming you're inside a jquery event handler
[04:41:12] <sysdef> i need the content of the next left div and the one below (in the table)
[04:41:32] <sysdef> for the one below i need to do some math with the id
[04:41:44] <xec> .prev()? .next()?
[04:42:04] <xec> if it's relative to the current element, traversing is usually better
[04:42:12] <xec> what does your html look like?
[04:43:10] <xec> likely, you only need to read about .closest(), .find(), .next() and .prev()
[04:43:57] <sysdef> xec: like http://pastebin.ca/2430969
[04:45:09] <sysdef> i think .next() will not help me to jump to the next cell below (next tr element aka row but same column)
[04:45:42] <xec> sure it will, but it'll be slightly trickier to find the right column
[04:46:55] <xec> you'll have to save the index of the <td>, go up to the <tr>, do .next() and then do something like .children.eq(index)
[04:47:28] <xec> .children().eq(index)*
[04:47:30] <sysdef> maxbe i can use a data-col="2"
[04:47:58] <xec> sure, but then you have to read the col of the current td first, might as well just look at the index
[04:48:11] <xec> just do $(this).index() if this is the <td>
[04:48:25] <doug65536> sysdef: you could use row= cell.nearest('<tr>').next(); cellindex = row.index(cell); row.next().find('td').eq(cellindex) ?
[04:48:36] <lemonsparrow> Is there a way to now check if it's bound before I could bind it again  https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6210190
[04:48:59] <xec> doug65536: row.index(N) would find the Nth row (as opposed to column)
[04:49:26] <doug65536> xec: row.index(element) is what I meant
[04:49:35] <sysdef> i think you lost me :|
[04:50:04] <xec> sysdef: read the API docs for .closest() .next() .eq() .index() and .children()
[04:50:05] <doug65536> oh, sorry, not nearest, I meant closest
[04:50:30] <xec> doug65536: ah, yeah youre right
[04:51:27] <doug65536> ah, and replace the 'find' call I mentioned with children
[04:52:33] <sysdef> like row = cell.nearest('<tr>').next(); cellindex = row.index(element); row.next().children('td').eq(cellindex)
[04:52:45] <doug65536> sysdef: yes
[04:52:56] <xec> sysdef: what does .nearest() do?
[04:53:03] <sonOfRa> Is it possible to look up things by data? Something like all <td> elements that have data("foo", "bar")?
[04:53:09] <sysdef> err, .closest()
[04:53:29] <doug65536> sysdef: close, you can't immediately do next before assigning row, otherwise, row.index will look in the next row, not current
[04:53:43] <tgmxrce> bonjour jqueriers! I am trying to get jqueryui (like drag and drop) to work with touch. touchpunch doesn't seem to work any more, and it doesn't look like jQTouch is focused on the ui widgets. can anyone suggest way that I can get jquery-ui's drag and drop working with touch? I see that dojo's dnd works fine, but then i'd have to use dojo d-:
[04:53:45] <xec> sysdef: what is the "cell" var?
[04:54:29] <doug65536> xec: the td you are starting from
[04:54:34] <sysdef> xec: $(this) i guess
[04:55:16] <doug65536> I'll make fiddle to make sure what I'm saying is correct
[05:01:29] <sysdef> what is wrong with $(this).next().text() ?
[05:02:46] <sysdef> eg. $("#debug").val( $(this).next.text() );
[05:03:16] <sysdef> err. ...  $("#debug").val( $(this).next().text() );
[05:03:26] <doug65536> done: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/chehR/
[05:03:46] <sysdef> while this is working well:  $("#debug").val( $(this).text() );
[05:04:03] <anli> I want an event handler that is trigged when a div of a certain class is appended to the dom, is that possible?
[05:04:07] <doug65536> sysdef: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/chehR/
[05:04:55] <anli> What I really want is an event handler that is executed when a ckeditor dialog is popped up
[05:05:53] <krishnaveda> hi need help with this issue https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6210190
[05:05:54] <sysdef> doug65536: wow, thank you!
[05:06:02] <doug65536> sysdef: np
[05:09:33] <sysdef> not even $("#debug").val( $(this).next('div').text() ); is working :|
[05:09:37] <jop008> jqMobile I want <label>  space <input checkbox> but I can't find it out looked here http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/widgets/checkbox/#&ui-state=dialog
[05:09:53] <doug65536> sysdef: do you need one that can handle cellspan?
[05:09:59] <doug65536> colspan I mean
[05:10:13] <doug65536> just realized that only works for regular table without colspans
[05:13:53] <jop008> How to put the label infront of a checkbox see also http://jsfiddle.net/YpZq5/
[05:15:56] <krishnaveda> ecthiender: https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6210190
[05:16:19] <sysdef> doug65536: i think i don't have colspans here. the data are from excel sheets, csv and pdf files and well filtered
[05:17:09] <doug65536> sysdef: for fun I'm going to make one that handles it anyway :)
[05:18:49] <seutje> colspans: joy to the world!
[05:20:49] <krishnaveda> seutje: https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6210190
[05:21:20] <sysdef> doug65536: i even fail to get the next cell's div content :s
[05:21:54] <seutje> krishnaveda: wtf? bind, unbind, rebind?
[05:21:59] <xec> sysdef: the question I asked earlier still stands, what is "this" referring to?
[05:22:36] <xec> i.e. what is the click handler bound to?
[05:22:55] <doug65536> sysdef: can you show code?
[05:22:55] <sysdef> yes. it's a .click( ... )
[05:23:04] <sysdef> $("#debug").val( $(this).parent().next().children(0).text() ); is working ^^
[05:23:24] <sysdef> but i guess there is a short version
[05:23:38] <SargoDarya> sysdef: what kind of abomination is that?
[05:23:41] <doug65536> sysdef: don't use $(this)... see my fiddle. make your event function take an event parameter and use $(ev.target)
[05:23:54] <krishnaveda> sysdef: its a case where after filter when there is no data I unbind the click event
[05:24:06] <krishnaveda> Successful: its a case where after filter when there is no data I unbind the click event
[05:24:17] <krishnaveda> seutje: its a case where after filter when there is no data I unbind the click event
[05:24:25] <xec> lol
[05:24:30] <xec> tab fail :)
[05:24:31] <seutje> krishnaveda: shouldn't bind/unbind
[05:24:38] <seutje> krishnaveda: instead bind, and check within the handler
[05:24:52] <krishnaveda> seutje: then later when I filter again and there is data.. I want to enable bind
[05:25:15] <seutje> yeah, that's silly
[05:25:32] <seutje> better off toggling a class and checking for the class
[05:26:02] <krishnaveda> seutje: could u edit on code a lil and show how
[05:26:11] <jop008> So it is very hard to have a lable before the checkbox anyone an idea how to?
[05:26:24] <seutje> like $('table').on('click', 'th.hasData', function() { ... }); on filtering, add the "hasData" class to the THs
[05:26:56] <seutje> jop008: erm what?
[05:27:16] <seutje> <label for="foo">foo</label><input name="foo" />
[05:27:19] <jop008> <label> and after that the checkbox
[05:27:28] <seutje> <label for="foo">foo</label><input name="foo" type="checkbox" />
[05:27:28] <jop008> Yes something like that
[05:27:45] <seutje> so... it is not very hard
[05:27:55] <seutje> u can reverse em and float if u want
[05:27:56] <jop008> it is not rendered like the way you wont is is on a form with these elements
[05:28:00] <seutje> or even wrap the input within the label
[05:28:27] <jop008> <div data-role="fieldcontain"><label for="password">Password:</label><input type="checkbox" name="checkbox-name" id="checkbox-id" />
[05:28:34] <sysdef> doug65536: i'm currently working on the easier, horizontal version. it should be very easy, something like $("#debug").val( $(this).next('div').text() );
[05:29:00] <seutje> jop008: read up on the for attribute
[05:29:14] <krishnaveda> seutje: I have click event for each th of table and for each event differnet parameter is being passed to method
[05:29:15] <sysdef> doug65536: i try to get the div content from the very next (right of) td but it's nort working
[05:29:26] <krishnaveda> seutje: would it be that easy to generalize it
[05:29:29] <sysdef> -r
[05:29:41] <pachet> why would a td have a <div> sibling
[05:29:44] <seutje> krishnaveda: have you noticed this "different parameter" is always exactly the same as this.id?
[05:29:58] <seutje> so in fact, the handler is always the same
[05:30:14] <seutje> tableCamp.sorter(this.id, this)
[05:30:27] <seutje> (assuming it's being called on the TH)
[05:30:56] <krishnaveda> seutje: correct... but I didnt understand ur code.. could u correct my code.. I would then understand it better.. thanks
[05:30:59] <doug65536> handles colspan:  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/chehR/
[05:31:25] <doug65536> sysdef: can you show code snippet?
[05:32:00] <doug65536> sysdef: my guess is in your click handler, use $(ev.target).closest('td').next('td') to find next cell
[05:32:40] <seutje> jop008: so this is not the correct rendering? http://jsbin.com/ocatuf/1/edit
[05:34:58] <jop008> This is what I mean http://jsfiddle.net/
[05:35:07] <doug65536> jop008: why do you want the label before the checkbox? the label is always after the checkbox
[05:35:20] <jop008> The owner checkbox must be at the same place as password input field
[05:35:45] <jop008> no not correct
[05:36:02] <doug65536> sysdef: the next cell has a div in it that you want to find?
[05:36:08] <sysdef> doug65536: like this http://pastebin.ca/2430986
[05:36:20] <jop008> Since it feels more natural to have it in font of the input value
[05:36:39] <sysdef> missed a ")"
[05:37:00] <doug65536> jop008: it feels completely unnatural that way. ever done a multiple choice text? ever filled out a form in real life? ever seen a checkbox in an existing UI?
[05:37:10] <doug65536> multiple choice test*
[05:37:40] <sysdef> doug65536: where '#mode_select' is a dropdown element
[05:37:48] <jop008> Yes there it is the other way around but I filled in forms where the label was in front
[05:38:06] <jop008> like a whole form and then are you pregnant
[05:38:20] <jop008> but okay I will change it
[05:39:03] <seutje> krishnaveda: http://pastebin.com/EnCxZcmX could prolly use some more optimization though
[05:39:15] <sysdef> doug65536: it's workig well but looks ugly to me. i can live tith it and our JS coder may fix it or do it smarter ^^
[05:39:19] <seutje> don't like how those 2 THs are separately created, but nearly identical
[05:39:25] <sysdef> with*
[05:39:49] <doug65536> sysdef: the way you are doing it is not great at all
[05:40:07] <doug65536> you are trying to get the content of the this cell and the next 3 cells into an array?
[05:40:22] <sysdef> doug65536: right
[05:40:48] <doug65536> sysdef: just the raw text, dropping any wrappers in the cells like divs, correct?
[05:41:15] <sysdef> yes
[05:41:33] <krishnaveda> seutje: thanks
[05:41:48] <doug65536> sysdef: I'll see what I can come up with
[05:41:53] <seutje> doug65536: ever been in a RTL environment? :P
[05:41:53] <sysdef> doug65536: i added a comment: // fix me or do it smarter if you can!
[05:42:40] <stonekeeper> Hi. I'm running $.map on a large dataset and it's locking the browser. I've googled for some answers but didn't get too far. Is there a non-blocking version of $.map? Thanks.
[05:43:01] <seutje> jop008: no clue what you mean, and the jsfiddle you linked to is the homepage, so I assume you forgot to press "save"
[05:43:10] <jop008> Now like this http://jsfiddle.net/jop007/n3dtB/
[05:46:45] <seutje> you're kidding, right?
[05:47:57] <seutje> jop008: could have told me u were using jquery UI
[05:49:25] <seutje> you'll have to override some of the CSS
[05:52:51] <krishnaveda> seutje: this like is wrong I guess $('#table-camp').removeClass('hasData');
[05:53:03] <krishnaveda> seutje: shouldnt it be from th that we need remove the class
[05:55:20] <krishnaveda> https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6210190 is there a way to combine these two ?
[05:56:59] <Cork> krishnaveda: just remove the ;\n$('#table-campaigns th') part
[05:58:20] <sysdef> doug65536: yeah, i think i need a loop to the end, too :s
[06:00:54] <krishnaveda> Cork: u mean             $('#table-campaigns th').unbind('click').css({    'cursor': 'default',  'background-position': 'right center' }.removeClass('hasData');
[06:01:08] <Cork> no, leave the )
[06:02:12] <seutje> krishnaveda: fuck if I know, I just replicated the logic already present
[06:02:21] <seutje> that line had a comment about filtering and removing the condition
[06:03:34] <doug65536> sysdef: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/AJjFX/10/
[06:03:53] <doug65536> sysdef: the green d4 is a cell with a div that has d4 in it
[06:04:57] <krishnaveda> seutje: yes it worked.. thanks
[06:05:08] <krishnaveda> seutje: this is some css changes
[06:05:43] <seutje> krishnaveda: those should probably reside in a css file
[06:12:53] <magentar> is there a way to securily display a html fragment in a <div> for viewing? currently I am filtering the html on the server side and call $(..).html(val); however then val can still be illegal html and mess up the page's layout (or even do more serious stuff). Any idea how I can make html() not effect the outer part of the dom?
[06:13:10] <magentar> <scripts> etc. are already filtered out
[06:14:12] <magentar> ah it seems to be something else... just <style> tags...
[06:14:13] <Cork> magentar: run tidy on if after you're done
[06:14:22] <Cork> if==it
[06:14:53] <Cork> magentar: you can tell the browser to not allow some effect though csp
[06:15:09] <Cork> but it is just an extra protection, you need to handle this on the server side
[06:15:09] <doug65536> magentar: call text
[06:15:22] <Cork> can't use any html if you do that
[06:16:02] <doug65536> magentar: if you pass a string to text, it will set the text of the element
[06:16:02] <magentar> yeah it seems that i was wrong. the html is not incorrect, it just includes <style> tags that mess up the parent dom
[06:16:19] <magentar> so i just need to filter out all style tags
[06:16:53] <magentar> it's actually a mail system. Gmail is very similar and they also allow stylesheets. i wonder how they do it
[06:17:00] <doug65536> magentar: my_div.find('style').remove()
[06:17:28] <magentar> yeah thanks, i'll do that on the server side if needed
[06:18:50] <magentar> first i'll try to restrict the <style> declarations to the target div somehow. looking at gmail for inspiration ;)
[06:20:01] <Cork> magentar: the restriction doens't work in all browsers
[06:20:11] <Cork> quite far from it actually
[06:21:10] <sysdef> doug65536: yay, thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/AJjFX/12/
[06:21:44] <doug65536> sysdef: to make it return all the rest of the cells, just omit the second parameter to slice. np :)
[06:21:46] <krishnaveda> Cork: https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6210190
[06:21:55] <Cork> magentar: the only way to semi safely restrict css client side is through <iframe>
[06:22:08] <magentar> looks like gmail actually inlines all styles. wow.
[06:22:13] <magentar> that's way too much work
[06:22:28] <magentar> i'll just remove all <style>'s
[06:22:30] <Cork> magentar: there is libs to do that
[06:22:49] <Cork> libs that actually parse the css and filter what they are allowed to do
[06:22:53] <magentar> cool, googling...
[06:23:02] <magentar> i use antisamy atm, perhaps they support that
[06:23:17] <Cork> krishnaveda: ?
[06:24:57] <sysdef> doug65536: setting a maximum to 100 is a good idea in my case. if someone accidencially select a vertical table on a large (>500k rows) table ...
[06:25:24] <krishnaveda> Cork: yes I want to remove class classData for both the th in a single line. is there a way ?
[06:26:17] <Cork> krishnaveda: set the cursor information in a class
[06:26:30] <krishnaveda> Cork: https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6210190
[06:26:39] <Cork> and then do $('th.hasData').removeClass('hasData pointer')
[06:27:04] <Cork> (where pointer is an .pointer { cursor: pointer; } )
[06:27:07] <krishnaveda> Cork: the thing is I dont want for all elements containing hasData... hasData to be removed.. only for these two
[06:27:24] <Cork> krishnaveda: so how do you want to target them then?
[06:27:36] <krishnaveda> Cork: with ids
[06:27:44] <krishnaveda> Cork: id and action are the two ids
[06:27:59] <Cork> $('#id, #action').removeClass('hasData pointer') then
[06:29:23] <krishnaveda> Cork: thanks
[06:30:11] <krishnaveda> Cork: with than hasData got removed but not cursor:pointer
[06:30:27] <krishnaveda> Cork: I want to replace cursor : pointer with cursor : default
[06:30:28] <Cork> like i said, move the css into a class
[06:31:21] <krishnaveda> Cork: otherwise how can I remove that style  for now ?
[06:32:00] <Cork> there is some hacky ways, but none that doens't guarantee you get the effect you want
[06:32:14] <Cork> you can try ex. .css('cursor', '')
[06:32:25] <Cork> but it can give the wrong effect sometimes
[06:32:46] <Cork> *uh none that does guarantee
[06:33:29] <Cork> .css('cursor', '') <-- this basically writes an invalid value to the cursor property and lets the browser error handler pick the option it things is best
[06:34:03] <Cork> another option is to remove the style attribute removeAttr('style')
[06:34:19] <Cork> but that removes all inline styles
[06:34:53] <Tomashe> hey guys i got some issue with jquery mobile. seems like when i click on link its automatic lunch the pushstate .. is that possible?
[06:35:29] <krishnaveda> Cork: this worked $('#index, #action').removeClass('hasData pointer').removeAttr('style');
[06:36:06] <Cork> krishnaveda: warning though, it will break things if anything else touches the style of that element
[06:36:12] <Cork> (and there for is a bad choice)
[06:37:03] <Cork> you should write your scripts so other scripts can work with the element without breaking your script or the other way around
[06:37:20] <Cork> makes maintenance MUCH easier down the line
[06:37:56] <Cork> when you can just write a new script for the new functionality needed, instead of writing it + modifying every other script that exists so they don't break it
[06:38:02] <Cork> when==then
[06:38:48] <Cork> (and that's why css('cursor', '') isn't any better)
[06:47:11] <Tomashe> why jquery mobile using pushstate on every link click
[06:47:12] <Tomashe> ?
[06:48:54] <tankBlergh> Hi people! I was wondering what the best way of making a $(window).resize(someFunction) function that only runs "someFunction" when I release the mousebutton ?
[06:49:39] <tankBlergh> the point is that I want it to run only when I'm done resizing
[06:49:55] <ajpiano> tankBlergh: you should debounce the resize handler
[06:50:55] <ajpiano> there are many many articles on it but this one came out today so i'll link to it http://andyshora.com/how-bad-is-dom-interaction-javascript.html
[06:51:11] <krishnaveda> Cork: is there a way to write this piece of code in a better way ? https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6210980
[06:51:24] <tankBlergh> thanks. ajpiano!
[06:51:56] <Cork> krishnaveda: move line 2 into your css file
[06:52:04] <Cork> (2-5)
[06:53:33] <steveccc> are there any current query video podcasts?
[06:53:37] <krishnaveda> Cork: sure i am looking from a colon and no of lines perspective
[06:55:01] <steveccc> that was jquery vido podcasts sorry
[07:02:51] <sysdef> doug65536: my problem is i have a div inside of every td element .s
[07:04:58] <doug65536> sysdef: ok, that should work fine. does it work for you?
[07:05:31] <sysdef> doug65536: nope. i try to fix the parent() and children() parts ...
[07:06:23] <doug65536> sysdef: the parent and children parts don't need to change
[07:08:04] <doug65536> sysdef: works for me if every cell has div http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/AJjFX/14/
[07:08:51] <sysdef> doug65536: my result: http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/bildschirmfoto-12082013-160829.php
[07:09:30] <sysdef> doug65536: http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/bildschirmfoto-12082013-160926.php
[07:09:39] <LrdArc> hi! please take a lookt at this http://jsbin.com/amuheb
[07:09:50] <LrdArc> i'm trying to add more tab when the button clicked
[07:10:25] <doug65536> sysdef: after you changed the parent/children stuff?
[07:12:11] <sysdef> no
[07:12:11] <sysdef> doug65536: i'll check it again ...
[07:12:36] <doug65536> sysdef: I would need a row of that table's html to test against fiddle to find issue
[07:15:10] <doug65536> sysdef: I set it up to iterate over the entire dom subtree under the node and build a string from all the text... I can't see how those extra array entries are created
[07:15:52] <doug65536> sysdef: you broke it
[07:15:57] <doug65536> sysdef: line 13 is wrong
[07:18:03] <sysdef> doug65536: i push the cell to the array
[07:18:12] <sysdef> doug65536: have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/AJjFX/15/
[07:18:15] <doug65536> no you wrecked it
[07:18:35] <doug65536> it pushes every text node into a separate output array entry
[07:18:57] <doug65536> your changes made it output all those blank extra entries
[07:19:48] <doug65536> sysdef: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/AJjFX/16/
[07:20:15] <doug65536> fixed it for you ^
[07:22:29] <doug65536> that loop that you messed with was gathering the text in the node, unwrapping the text from any divs or containers in the td.
[07:22:42] <doug65536> you exploded each fragment in the td into separate entries with your changes
[07:22:55] <nisseni> I have an element - now want the exact same element below but different id - what's the easiest way to achieve that?
[07:25:09] <doug65536> god I hate all this join/part spam
[07:25:32] <Cork> doug65536: then config your client to hide it
[07:28:20] <Tomashe> why jquery mobile using pushstate on every link click?
[07:28:32] <BillCriswell> doug65536: My client has the ability to not show them.
[07:28:39] <BillCriswell> Yours may too.
[07:28:40] <arschmitz> Tomashe: because it uses ajax navigation
[07:28:59] <doug65536> I use xchat (aka piece-of-crap-chat)
[07:29:46] <BillCriswell> doug65536: It must be doable.
[07:29:55] <BillCriswell> /set irc_conf_mode 1 perhaps?
[07:30:00] <BillCriswell> minus the perhaps?
[07:30:54] <doug65536> BillCriswell: say something (not to me, just something)
[07:31:02] <BillCriswell> Hi.
[07:31:09] <doug65536> BillCriswell: thanks. that fixed the spam
[07:31:14] <BillCriswell> Sweeeet.
[07:31:43] <BillCriswell> I like hiding those events till I'm explaining something to someone for 5 minutes and realize they aren't there.
[07:31:55] <BillCriswell> Then I turn it back on again... then off again later.
[07:34:24] <doug65536> yes. ping timeout spam is so useless though. if you could just turn that garbage off it would be fine to have join/part coming up
[07:34:47] <doug65536> then you could see ragequits without spam
[07:34:57] <tankBlergh> can you monitor the touch events from an ipad/iphone?
[07:35:33] <doug65536> tankBlergh: http://api.jquerymobile.com/tap/
[07:35:35] <Tomashe> but it uses ajax navigateion wrongly ... it isnt load the page properly when using this ajax navigation
[07:35:38] <tankBlergh> thanks
[07:36:58] <Tomashe> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined
[07:37:03] <doug65536> tankBlergh: http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/ has more complete list, like touch, swipe swipeLeft swipeRight etc
[07:37:05] <Tomashe> i have this error on the console
[07:37:48] <sammich> console.log/debugger are your friends
[07:37:50] <sammich> use them
[07:37:58] <doug65536> sysdef: you still here? your changes broke my script. I posted fix link above
[07:38:39] <sammich> also, anyone use TinyMCE? Having trouble with after serving it up via AJAX
[07:38:51] <sammich> it seems to be hitting cachefly for imaginary files
[07:39:40] <sunbeam> Is there a way to change the default padding left/right in bootstrap?
[07:42:37] <jop008> I have a form with inline php a msg is generated but the page is already refreshed see http://pastebin.com/RWANBtw1
[07:42:58] <jop008> maybe use ajax for valiadation and not inline php?
[07:45:46] <Tomashe> Please guys any jquery mobile pro here.. i got some serious issues with that ajax navigation..
[07:46:06] <Tomashe> it looks like the page that loads is not loading correcly and after manual refresh it suddely fixed
[07:46:11] <Tomashe> what could cause that?
[07:46:51] <arschmitz> Tomashe: are you including scripts in the head of your page your trying to load?
[07:47:05] <Tomashe> yes
[07:47:11] <arschmitz> those will not be loaded
[07:47:12] <Tomashe> why
[07:47:24] <arschmitz> it only pulls the page div
[07:47:28] <arschmitz> not the head
[07:47:41] <Tomashe> ohhh
[07:47:55] <Tomashe> what div exactly? or u mean BODY?
[07:48:05] <arschmitz> the div with data-role="page"
[07:48:22] <Tomashe> but i dont have a div like that
[07:48:33] <arschmitz> well thats part of your problem too then
[07:48:40] <sammich> arschmitz: thanks for flattening jQM ;)
[07:48:42] <arschmitz> jQuery mobile requires the use of pages
[07:48:45] <Tomashe> but i got PHP on the header too
[07:49:05] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah you tried 1.4-alpha?
[07:49:11] <sammich> I'm eagerly awaiting the 2nd beta
[07:49:20] <sammich> I'll post some bugs if they still exist then
[07:49:29] <sammich> 2nd alpha*
[07:49:32] <arschmitz> sammich: there will probably be an alpha 2 later today
[07:49:38] <sammich> ooh, sweet
[07:49:54] <arschmitz> i made a kinda big change so we decided to do a second alpha
[07:50:37] <arschmitz> sammich: if you use any 3rd party widgets this change will be good
[07:50:56] <sammich> fairly good timing, we've got some end user testing going on, and I built a really simple one in 1.4 to see what it's like
[07:51:09] <sammich> no 3rd party
[07:51:33] <Tomashe>  data-role="page"
[07:51:42] <Tomashe> should i put itinside the body or as the body?
[07:51:48] <arschmitz> ok so you wont see a huge difference mostly that trigger( "change" ) is deprecated
[07:51:56] <arschmitz> Tomashe: it should be a div inside the body
[07:52:41] <arschmitz> sammich: instead now you can just call $("#container").enhanceWithin();
[07:53:06] <sammich> oh, damn
[07:53:15] <sammich> thanks
[07:53:34] <sammich> so I don't have to lookup what the widget method names are anymore
[07:53:49] <sammich> buttonMarkup is the strangest one I've had to remember
[07:54:03] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah this will enhance everything that exists within the container
[07:54:26] <sammich> is it expensive?
[07:55:10] <arschmitz> not really i mean there is of course a bit more over head then direct calls but it just checks if the initSlector for each widget exists within the element you called on and calls the widget
[07:55:44] <arschmitz> sammich: so as long as yoru container is not too too big and complicated it will be very fast
[07:55:51] <sammich> don't suppose it really matters, you wouldn't be calling it that often if doing things right
[07:56:19] <Tomashe> so basicly i need to put my javascript functions inside that  data-role="page"
[07:56:20] <Tomashe> ?
[07:56:21] <sammich> when I was first building out the data forms, I was hitting the page.trigger('refresh') every data change
[07:56:28] <arschmitz> sammich: but if you have some like mega page and call on whole thing yeah it is going to have to traverse the whole thing of course
[07:56:46] <sammich> you should've seen the responsiveness on the iPad 2 when I was playing with the slider ;)
[07:57:08] <arschmitz> Tomashe: no you should have everything in the head of every page and have it set up in such a way that it triggers on pageinit of the page you want
[07:57:24] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah sliders are something we need to refactor
[07:57:35] <sammich> it's all good now though. Might have to revisit the slider again though, I may have left that as a TODO
[07:57:36] <arschmitz> would have liked to for 1.4 but just ran out of time
[07:57:43] <Mrgoose> I have a jquery mobile question.  Any way to customize the icon  on the back button
[07:57:51] <sammich> data-icon
[07:58:06] <Mrgoose> I mean on the auto generated "back" button
[07:58:31] <Mrgoose> data-add-back-btn="true"  , i put that in my code and it automatically adds the back button
[07:58:33] <Mrgoose> when needed
[07:59:10] <sammich> arschmitz: any chance you guys redid the black theme a bit? it's really hard on the list dividers
[07:59:56] <arschmitz> no we didnt make any changes like that but i can look into it really we want to encourage people to build more custom themes with theme roller
[08:01:53] <sammich> yeah, I've wanted to like I do with jQuery but I feel it's a bit more demanding
[08:02:17] <sammich> maybe that's just me because if I had a phobia, it would be picking a set of matching colours
[08:02:41] <arschmitz> sammich: it wont be as bad now with the new themes
[08:02:50] <arschmitz> not as confusing with all the intermixed swatches
[08:03:04] <sammich> there isn't a roller for 1.4 yet is there?
[08:03:04] <arschmitz> sammich: ohh i do see your point though
[08:03:06] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/177/edit
[08:03:15] <arschmitz> sammich: no
[08:03:26] <sammich> yeah, it's pretty much black on white
[08:03:48] <arschmitz> sammich: and hard to tell between dividers and items
[08:03:48] <sammich> although I'm using white lists with black headers
[08:03:58] <sammich> which is even more harsh
[08:04:35] <arschmitz> sammich: so like this http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/177/edit
[08:05:02] <sammich> yeah.
[08:07:58] <sammich> since I have your attention, one more thing: is there a clean way to have > 1 button on the right in the header bar? I've got a mashup of float:right and onLoad $().buttonMarkup()
[08:08:00] <arschmitz> sammich: contrast is being looked at by our theme guy
[08:08:11] <sammich> sweet :)
[08:08:28] <sammich> I should maybe make an example
[08:10:07] <arschmitz> sammich: sure
[08:15:03] <sammich> arschmitz: I think this is how you use jsbin http://jsbin.com/esixoz/1/edit
[08:15:29] <sammich> the mass of CSS is just a hack, and obviously isn't tailored for 1.4
[08:16:28] <arschmitz> sammich: there is a way but something is wrong i just noticed
[08:16:35] <juboba> how can I check if someone clicked on a div or one of its children?
[08:16:35] <arschmitz> because its not working on master
[08:18:37] <sammich> buttonMarkup?
[08:19:43] <Elirips> Hello. If I use .children(); Can I also tell jquery to sort the children by a specific attribute?
[08:19:53] <sammich> sort?
[08:20:12] <Elirips> or then in the $.each
[08:20:19] <sammich> do you want to arrange them on the DOM, or do you just want a collection sorted?
[08:20:28] <Elirips> the collection should be sorted
[08:20:41] <Elirips> the dom should not be altered
[08:20:44] <sammich> you could just use .sort with a comparator function
[08:21:25] <Elirips> on which object do I need to sort? On the selector returned by children(); ?
[08:21:26] <arschmitz> sammich: not buttonMarkup just making 2 left buttons lol
[08:21:46] <sammich> two left, or right?
[08:22:53] <filkinsteez> anyone know an alternative to AnythingZoomer?
[08:23:06] <sammich> Elirips: get your elements any way you wish, then you could hit $().toArray()
[08:23:36] <Elirips> sammich: ah great. As soon as I have an array its clear to me :) Thank you
[08:23:59] <sammich> yeah, then just query each element for the comparator
[08:24:05] <sammich> you're wlecome
[08:25:26] <arschmitz> sammich: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/179/edit
[08:25:41] <sammich> just about to tell you I had to go to sleep lol
[08:26:07] <sammich> arschmitz: yeah, two left is okay, but two right is a bit iffy
[08:26:09] <arschmitz> sammich: that will get you multiple left or right buttons
[08:26:18] <sammich> ah, gotcha
[08:26:33] <sammich> does that work on 1.3?
[08:26:40] <arschmitz> just a sec ill make sure
[08:26:45] <sammich> sorry, thanks
[08:26:54] <sammich> don't know the link OTTOMH :)
[08:27:10] <arschmitz> sammich: no exactly lol
[08:27:18] <arschmitz> it stacks them apparently
[08:27:45] <sammich> ah, so I'm not crazy to hack it then
[08:27:57] <juboba> how can I check if someone clicked on a div or one of its children?
[08:28:38] <arschmitz> sammich: no in this case your fine and its just css so not really a hack
[08:29:18] <sammich> I consider it a hack if I have to write inline styles ;)
[08:29:48] <sammich> well, with that many
[08:29:51] <arschmitz> sammich: oh actually i take that back
[08:30:06] <arschmitz> sammich: it will work in 1.3 just need to set data-inline="true"
[08:30:24] <sammich> on the div containing the class?
[08:30:30] <sammich> oops, a tags?
[08:30:42] <arschmitz> sammich: yup
[08:30:45] <Neillithan> Is there a way to store a div's number position in a variable?  For example:  If I have 4 divs and I click the third one, create a variable with the #3 in it?
[08:31:01] <arschmitz> in 1.4 all header buttons get inline but in 1.3 you need to set it explicitly
[08:31:47] <sammich> okay, I'm down to 6 hours of sleep now
[08:32:00] <sammich> arschmitz: thanks so much for the assist
[08:32:02] <arschmitz> sammich: ok take care glad i could help you avoid hack :)
[08:32:15] <sammich> me too
[08:32:38] <sammich> nite
[08:36:49] <Neillithan> Is there a way to store a div's number position in a variable?  For example:  If I have 4 divs and I click the third one, create a variable with the #3 in it?
[08:46:37] <aksu> can i write jquery code into a javascript file? like i have javascript code in the file
[08:47:29] <arschmitz> aksu: jquery is just javascript so yes
[08:48:38] <aksu> ok thnx
[08:53:05] <Wescotte> I'm using the jQuery data tables addon and it works simple enough. However, I have some functionality that removes <tbody> from the table and rebuilds it. I call $('#myTable').dataTable(); again after populating the data again but it doesn't seem to actually do anything. It reverts all the <tr>'s to the original styles and the footer line of "Showing 1 to 3 of 3 entries" is the same data as
[08:53:05] <Wescotte> teh old table.
[08:57:29] <juboba> how can I check if someone clicked on a div or one of its children?
[08:58:13] <sergey> How can I add time remaining on the page? For example 7 days 10 hours 20 seconds left.
[08:58:20] <duch_kazatel> juboba - you could attach a listener to the div that's something like $('#myDiv').on('click', '*', function(e){...});
[09:00:53] <juboba> thanks
[09:03:31] <duch_kazatel> juboba - I would HIGHLY suggest that you setup to listen for clicks on specific elements, though, like <a> or <li> or whatever.
[09:03:32] <ernston> hello
[09:03:43] <ernston> am trying to get my jsfiddle working so i can ask for help
[09:03:52] <ernston> would i be able to get some pre help help ?
[09:05:29] <filkinsteez> anyone know an alternative to AnythingZoomer?
[09:06:32] <wibby> hi, i use http://jqueryui.com/accordion/ and i've got a textarea in each panel. I'd like to be able to step through each panel with the tab-key. any ideas on how to do that?
[09:10:50] <Tomashe> omg that jquery mobile is killing me
[09:10:55] <Tomashe> anyone PLEASE help me out
[09:14:41] <juboba> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:16:32] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/138/  anyone?
[09:16:47] <ernston> working on favourites, you can add and delete ok, but the page does not refresh
[09:22:45] <c4ptnh00k> morning gents
[09:23:55] <c4ptnh00k> dynamically adding a button element and cant seem to get the button click event to fire. Can someone shed some light on this for me? http://jsfiddle.net/mDVMS/1/
[09:29:31] <duch_kazatel> c4ptnh00k - you have to either manually bind the click when you create the button, or use delegation on an element that exists at pageload.
[09:30:38] <Tomashe> anyone alive
[09:30:39] <Tomashe> ?
[09:30:48] <c4ptnh00k> I tried using live("click", function(){yada yada} but that didnt work either and live should be able to bind on future elements
[09:31:20] <duch_kazatel> the second method would mean that you'd change line 24 to something like $('#srvAddr').on('click', '.btnadder', function(e){...})
[09:32:16] <c4ptnh00k> hmm ill try that
[09:33:08] <duch_kazatel> c4ptnh00k - I'd look into even delegation.  jQuery makes it dead simple to use and makes life a lot easier for things like this.
[09:33:36] <c4ptnh00k> ok because that other way didnt work either
[09:35:12] <duch_kazatel> c4ptnh00k - you have to update the contents of the function, too.
[09:35:27] <duch_kazatel> it's not a single-sline replace :) just pointing you in a direction :)
[09:36:14] <janthony> Any ideas why a <script> string won't append to the dom? I did a console.log on the string, and it logs properly. I also replaced the script string with just a regular text string, and it appended to the dom correctly. I have also tried defining the script with var script = document.createElement ( 'script' );, script.type = 'text/javascript', script .src = 'myURL'; $('#myelement').append(script)
[09:36:19] <ernston> can anyone tell me why the page is not refreshing ? :S
[09:36:33] <c4ptnh00k> but the inner function is just a remove call. also the the alert is not even fireing meaning when event in general is not firing
[09:37:11] <duch_kazatel> c4ptnh00k let me look again.
[09:37:50] <c4ptnh00k> http://jsfiddle.net/mDVMS/2/
[09:38:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/U8geh/
[09:38:48] <duch_kazatel> try that.
[09:38:49] <duch_kazatel> that works.
[09:40:41] <c4ptnh00k> lol what the crap i dont see the difference really
[09:41:07] <duch_kazatel> c4ptnh00k what do you mean?  you don't see the difference between your original and my version?
[09:41:33] <janthony> Any idea why this script won't insert into the dom? http://pastie.org/8230005 - if I do console.log(script); it displays properly in the console.
[09:42:20] <c4ptnh00k> the difference is the selector used but i dont see how selecting the div for the click event is different than just the button
[09:42:27] <janthony> Hello World, is also appending properly.
[09:42:34] <ernston> how can i populate my jsfiddle example with data
[09:42:34] <Tomashe> http://www.lasso.co.il/mobile/%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94 < i have that mobile version of my website . i click on the glass on top and click on button and then some error POPS no idea what exactly...
[09:42:38] <Tomashe> or how to fix it
[09:42:40] <duch_kazatel> because you have to bind to an even that exists when the script initially runts.
[09:42:48] <duch_kazatel> *runs
[09:43:09] <duch_kazatel> if the element doesn't exist, the event can't bing.
[09:43:11] <duch_kazatel> *bind
[09:43:37] <c4ptnh00k> ah crap lol thanks. wont make that mistake again
[09:44:04] <duch_kazatel> so my version sets up a listener on the parent element that checks clicks for those that were on elements with that particular class.  and use .on(), not .delegate() - the former is old hat :)
[09:44:56] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/140/  <--- trying to add favourite data for jsfiddle purposes
[09:47:55] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel: did u talk to me ?
[09:48:06] <Tomashe> ohh ok , u did not LOL
[09:48:41] <ernston> i dunno wtf am doing
[09:55:37] <darkfrog> In jQuery UI you can set options like: $().autocomplete("option", "minLength", 0); Can you set multiple options in one call?
[09:58:46] <tw2113> i would imagine so
[10:01:28] <juboba> I'm trying to add a listener inside a plugin initialization. Hoy can I execute this instruction just once? (i.e. if it was called before, don't execute it)
[10:02:29] <jned> I have a modal that pops up, how can I automatically set .focus() to its input.  The modal pops up using css(bootstrap modal)
[10:03:10] <ernston> what a nightmare this is
[10:08:45] <Tomashe> ok the issue was the f**king migrate script
[10:08:57] <Tomashe> there is a way to migrate with out it , since when i remove it some css are gone :/
[10:11:09] <Tomashe> its jst not working without it now
[10:19:59] <carsonfull> Hey all. I have a question. Anyone here?
[10:20:57] <tw2113> 898 bots, carsonfull you're the only human
[10:22:09] <duch_kazatel> just put your question out there - if somebody can help, they will :)
[10:23:49] <carsonfull> When creating a deferred object should I use new or not? Which is better?
[10:25:07] <duch_kazatel> could you provide a jsfiddle that demonstrates what you're trying to accomplish?
[10:25:25] <carsonfull> Also in the api examples I see lots of functions that return promise objects. Why is $.when() used to attach a done handler?
[10:25:31] <carsonfull> Sure
[10:26:10] <Blaster> Hello, I am having problems with AJAX.   the URL of my page is http://mysite.com/app_test.php, but when I make an AJAX to a relative URL it's dropping the /app_test.php.   How can I get it to keep that?
[10:27:05] <Blaster> So for example, the current URL of my browser is http://mysite.com/app_test.php, and then if I make an AJAX request with $.ajax({url: '/ajax/dosomething'}),  it's sending to http://mysite.com/ajax/dosomething.  I want it to send to http://mysite.com/app_test.php/ajax/dosomething
[10:27:06] <Tomashe> hey guys ... http://www.lasso.co.il/mobile/%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94 . i make a simple example...
[10:27:26] <Tomashe> i put alert on top when click on the orange search on top
[10:27:48] <Tomashe> but after u click on the inner page . its navigate to other page its not working anymore.. the click listener just stop working
[10:29:32] <carsonfull> http://jsfiddle.net/NFXj4/
[10:30:08] <Tomashe> fixe
[10:31:11] <carsonfull> duch_kazatel: I dumbed it down. But basically I wanted postJson() to handle the json response and resolve/reject it
[10:31:39] <duch_kazatel> ah, and you're just asking if you need to use the new operator?
[10:32:06] <carsonfull> Well yes.
[10:32:14] <duch_kazatel> iirc it shouldn't matter.  the docs say it's totally optional.
[10:33:09] <ernston> arr ffs, how hard can i be to make a page reload
[10:33:25] <carsonfull> Ha! Should've read it better -___- Is there a better way to do it than that?
[10:33:38] <dashx> Hey gang, are dataTable questions applicable here?
[10:33:47] <carsonfull> Handling the $.post and response I mean
[10:34:19] <duch_kazatel> i'm actually not terribly familiar with $.deffered() myself - that's about the extent of my knowledge :)
[10:34:35] <carsonfull> Haha :)
[10:35:07] <carsonfull> I'm very new to it too. Seems like it is a great alternative to all these callbacks
[10:39:39] <ernston> mobile.changePage is not the same as F5, how can i reload the page to update the data?
[10:41:36] <jwmann> Let's say I selected multiple dom objects, what method would allow me to select one of those via its ID
[10:41:41] <jwmann> ?
[10:42:04] <sonOfRa> just $("#id")
[10:42:11] <sonOfRa> ids have to be unique in the dom anyways.
[10:42:57] <jwmann> Yes, I'm trying to avoid re-searching the entire dom when I already have narrowed the selection
[10:43:02] <shoky> jwmann: also .filter
[10:43:19] <jwmann> shoky: Sounds promising, I'll look into it
[10:44:40] <shoky> tho doing $("#id") doesn't really search the entire dom as you imply
[10:44:48] <jwmann> shoky: This was EXACTLY what I needed. Thank you!
[10:45:01] <Tomashe> i notice that when i use jquery mobile and load a new page its not replacing me the data-role="page" content with new content
[10:45:10] <Tomashe> its just adding me the new page content into data-role="page"
[10:45:18] <Tomashe> so i find myself with 2 contents on same page
[10:46:14] <ernston> $('#favList').listview('refresh');   is not refreshing  the list page
[10:51:19] <dashx> Hey guys, with DataTables is there a way to display a specific object but have that column sorted by a hidden object?
[11:04:11] <t0tht_-> hi
[11:04:12] <t0tht_-> http://pastebin.com/cqy7CzVy
[11:04:18] <t0tht_-> how i can bind again the scroll?
[11:06:06] <janthony> http://jsfiddle.net/HYJu2/18/ - any idea why this breaks if I uses an earlier version of jquery than 1.9.1?
[11:07:23] <zizzl> Hey guys trying out jQuery mobile, and I have an issue where I will click on a link and it will change the address bar of the browser but wont actually change pages, then I will try to click on another link and nothing happens. Has anyone seen any behavior like this?
[11:07:42] <nhulea> yo what up
[11:10:40] <filkinsteez> does anyone know of a good alternative to AnythingZoomer?
[11:16:35] <janthony> I found out why. It doesn't like appending to a child element of the body. If I use document.body.appendChild(script); (pure javascript) it works, but that is the wrong selector.
[11:19:00] <janthony> Got it. codeBox[0].appendChild( script );
[11:21:35] <InvidFlower> Anyone have any thoughts on the case where I really want a dom element instead of a jQuery wrapped and aren't sure what is being passed in? Am doing some grid stuff so need things like .cells, .rowIndex, etc. I could do $(foo)[0] but that's a bit ugly and seems inefficient? I could also make a helper function with: return variable instanceof jQuery ? variable[0] || variable.
[11:25:28] <t0tht_-> http://pastebin.com/cqy7CzVy
[11:25:29] <t0tht_-> how i can bind again the scroll?
[11:26:10] <zizzl> is there the jquery mobile panel sliding thing standalone
[11:26:14] <zizzl> without the rest of jquerymobile?
[11:47:04] <awc737> Is this part of jquery? $.Observable?
[11:47:16] <roflmaus> `if ($input.is(':checked'))` fails in IE8 (jQuery 1.10.2). How do i make it work?
[11:47:55] <roflmaus> awc737, no, it's a jQuery plugin: https://github.com/crystal88/jquery.observable
[11:48:28] <awc737> thanks
[11:49:25] <tw2113> what doesn't fail in IE
[11:50:35] <awc737> it seems the version of observable I have is from jquery mx
[11:50:37] <awc737> is that even still around
[11:54:44] <zth> does jquery scripts have to be in the header? or can they be put in the body too?
[11:55:27] <myosotis> the location of javascript code in html has nothing to do with jquery. I don't have any good links off the top of my head for you
[11:55:37] <myosotis> but the location the script occurs definitely affects things in important ways
[11:56:25] <tw2113> experts say put all your js at the bottom right before the </body>
[11:56:46] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 - not always - but when in doubt that's what you should do.
[11:57:11] <InvidFlower> Decided to answer my own question: http://jsperf.com/dom-or-jquery-to-dom
[11:59:03] <awc737> How can I access this property "foo" ?  http://i.imgur.com/Wo43YQ3.png
[12:01:07] <awc737> How can I access this property "foo" ?  http://i.imgur.com/Wo43YQ3.png
[12:01:31] <BillCriswell> awc737: prop20._data.foo ?
[12:02:07] <gnarf> tw2113: experts disagree on this :)
[12:02:33] <gnarf> tw2113: situational for sure
[12:02:40] <awc737> it didn'
[12:02:45] <awc737> BillCriswell, it didn't work :/
[12:02:45] * tw2113 goes to rethink life
[12:02:48] <awc737> stupid javascript mvc and jquery mx
[12:02:49] <gnarf> tw2113: also depends on if its something you want ready before or after page shows
[12:02:53] <InvidFlower> The reasoning is that the browser stops reading in and rendering the HTML while it waits for the JS to load. So if you had a ton of JS in the head, you'd get a white screen while waiting.
[12:03:21] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Ha.
[12:03:32] <gnarf> InvidFlower: but if you put everything at the bottom, you'll get an unenhanced page with broken clicks
[12:03:33] <awc737> is it possible to create an object property like this?
[12:03:41] <gnarf> for a short time
[12:03:43] <awc737> prop20: this.prototype.obThing.bind('change', function(ev, attr, how, newVal, oldVal){return 'awef';})
[12:03:49] <awc737> right now the property is returning a class
[12:03:55] <awc737> but I want it to return a string, 'awef'
[12:04:39] <InvidFlower> gnarf This is true. One way around it is to have certain functionality hidden  or greyed out at first. Like something which looks broken could have a hidden class that does visibility: hidden or whatever
[12:05:23] <InvidFlower> And the other thing is that if you use async loading like with require.js, you probably want that in the head since require.js itself isn't too too big and it lets the scripts start loading sooner..
[12:05:30] <carsonfull> Does $.post not parse json response?
[12:05:53] <Miezell> hello, I'm wondering if there a plugin  that interface with the majors types of calendars (ical, google , outlook & yahoo)
[12:05:56] <InvidFlower> carsonfull Do you have it set as 'json' ?
[12:06:30] <carsonfull> I can. Isn't that automatic?
[12:06:37] <gnarf> carsonfull: you can pass a dataType param: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ --- $.post(url, data, function(response) {}, 'json');
[12:06:46] <gnarf> it tries to guess
[12:06:57] <gnarf> but if the response mime type isn't the json one, it wont "guess"
[12:07:18] <smallfoot> $([]).length returns 0, but $({}).length returns 1, why?
[12:07:29] <carsonfull> Can I skip the success handler?
[12:07:42] <carsonfull> using done() instead
[12:08:01] <smallfoot> then you dont know if its failed
[12:08:02] <smallfoot> lol
[12:08:18] <carsonfull> well I'm using fail() too lol
[12:08:39] <smallfoot> but then it will execute fail() first, then done() after
[12:09:01] <carsonfull> it will?
[12:09:05] <smallfoot> yes
[12:09:15] <smallfoot> done() always gets executed, whether fail or success, i think
[12:09:29] <carsonfull> that's always()
[12:10:19] <smallfoot> hmm
[12:10:22] <smallfoot> im confused
[12:10:23] <smallfoot> then i dont kow
[12:10:27] <smallfoot> know*
[12:10:32] <grafi> read the docs ^^
[12:11:07] <ernston> is it ok to nest a click function inside another?
[12:11:20] <grafi> oO
[12:11:31] <smallfoot> seems rather stupid lol
[12:11:35] <carsonfull> haha
[12:11:50] <carsonfull> sounds like you want deferred objects
[12:11:52] <grafi> why would you want to do that ernston
[12:12:12] <ernston> because i cantthink of how to do what am trying to do
[12:12:16] <smallfoot> $([]).length returns 0, but $({}).length returns 1, why?
[12:12:44] <grafi> and what are you trying to do?
[12:13:08] <ernston> am trying to remove favourites from a list
[12:13:18] <carsonfull> smallfoot: isn't it because {} is an object?
[12:13:25] <grafi> and how would nesting click functions help? ^^
[12:13:45] <smallfoot> carsonfull, idk
[12:13:52] <carsonfull> Ah that's stupid. I put an empty function in the post params and now it works
[12:13:59] <ernston> am confused basically
[12:14:04] <smallfoot> just dont click the function that did the click then u got infinite loop
[12:14:05] <grafi> sounds like it
[12:14:07] <ernston> i am not sure what i need exactly
[12:14:31] <carsonfull> ernston: post it in a jsfiddle
[12:14:43] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/147/
[12:14:49] <ernston> this is where i was last upto
[12:15:13] <ernston> i have now realised that i am getting the parent() of the #deleteYes    and not the   .delUrl
[12:18:17] <ernston> am trying to get the numItem = $(this).parent().index();
[12:18:17] <nisseni> I'm getting this error in chrome, anyone? Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'icons' of undefined
[12:18:30] <nisseni> along with; GET chrome-extension://ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpki/Zero.js
[12:18:37] <ernston> and use it in the $("#deleteYes").click(function (e) {
[12:24:48] <notdan> So I have a regular onMouseClick event handler in plain javascript, that takes an event object and calls things like evt.clientX etc, how can I convert this code to jQuery's .mouseclick callback?
[12:25:03] <notdan> it appears to be that jQuery's event objects are slightly different?
[12:27:01] <notdan> or maybe not.. maybe I am doing something wrong in a different place
[12:29:59] <vanev> notdan: can you post a link to some code on jsfiddle, etc?
[12:30:47] <ernston> i tried posting a link for 2days now
[12:31:40] <nZac> Is there a way to execute a callback after a .each() is finished?
[12:34:03] <shoky> nZac: .each() is synchronous, code after it will be executed after it.  if you call asynchronous stuff inside the .each that's a different story, but the .each is completed fast anyway
[12:36:30] <nZac> shoky: Thanks for the help
[12:44:59] <filkinsteez> anyone know an alternative to AnythingZoomer?
[12:55:14] <ernston> maybe someone can help with this problem: http://jsfiddle.net/KFkw7/

[12:56:57] <mortal1> datatype: JSON
[12:57:19] <mortal1> err datatype: "json"
[12:57:26] <mortal1> ^ that?
[12:57:32] <ernston> i am trying to get the li index  of the  .delUrl  and then use that number with the next function
[12:58:06] <BillCriswell> mortal1: Is it valid json?
[12:58:55] <mortal1> BillCriswell: fair point, it's really text i suppose
[12:59:36] <BillCriswell> Awesome. I think.
[13:00:20] <netAction> Hi! How can I expand a small page to the browser height?
[13:00:55] <BillCriswell> mortal1: I'd make sure the right headers are being set and that the json is valid.
[13:00:59] <c4ptnh00k> is it possile to have jquery and jquery mobile running side by side?
[13:01:12] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: That have to be?
[13:01:18] <arschmitz> c4ptnh00k: jquery is required by jquery mobile
[13:01:25] <BillCriswell> Ok phew.
[13:01:59] <c4ptnh00k> ok never worked with mobile, but our app is now required to work on a tablet and I'm wondering how much this is going to suck
[13:02:14] <BillCriswell> Everything usually sucks, a lot.
[13:02:27] <c4ptnh00k> agreed lol
[13:02:28] <BillCriswell> jQuery makes it suck less, though.
[13:02:35] <arschmitz> ha ha
[13:02:51] <BillCriswell> I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today, don't mind me.
[13:03:05] <c4ptnh00k> so do i just include mobile or do i need to rewrite click events and add touch events?
[13:03:16] <ernston> dont tell me about things going wrong
[13:03:34] <arschmitz> c4ptnh00k: jquery mobile is a whole javascript html5 css3 framework
[13:03:56] <arschmitz> its not just special mobileness for regular jquery
[13:04:25] <c4ptnh00k> arschitz: in other words im screwed and left with a whole js rewrite?
[13:05:27] <arschmitz> c4ptnh00k: if you want to use jQuery Mobile yes you will probably have to re-write much of your app its not just a dropin its a whole ajax navigation framework
[13:06:00] <c4ptnh00k> arschmitz: ugh ok well thanks for the bad news. atleast i know now
[13:06:25] <arschmitz> c4ptnh00k: i suggest taking a look at the jquery mobile docs and demos
[13:06:32] <arschmitz> it will give you a better idea of what it does

[13:26:06] <okdamn> do you know how to delay an each loop?
[13:26:17] <okdamn> i tryed delay().each()
[13:26:21] <okdamn> but it's seems not working
[13:26:22] <okdamn> :(
[13:27:28] <BillCriswell> okdamn: Are you trying to do it for effect?
[13:27:39] <okdamn> effect?
[13:28:11] <BillCriswell> Are you trying to fade shit out one by one or something along those lines?
[13:28:26] <okdamn> nono just delay loop starting
[13:29:03] <BillCriswell> setTimeout(function(){ $.each(); }, 1000); could work.

[13:30:21] <arschmitz> zizzl: have you tried capturing the pagechangefailed or pageloadfailed events?
[13:30:39] <zizzl> arschmitz, can you show me how, learning...
[13:30:43] <arschmitz> or checking the console and network tabs to see if there is any sort of error
[13:47:27] <okdamn> sorry guys

[13:49:59] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  what about dude?
[13:50:02] <okdamn> :( can you help me
[13:50:34] <BillCriswell> okdamn: Post things to jsbin.com or jsdiffle.net.
[13:51:32] <BillCriswell> okdamn: You can't use delay unless you're in a queue, though.
[13:52:00] <okdamn> but it's delay+effect
[13:52:03] <okdamn> then callaback
[13:52:05] <okdamn> what's wrong?
[13:52:17] <BillCriswell> If needs to be called after an effect.

[13:52:31] <BillCriswell> You should be using setTimeout here, but you can sneak around it.
[13:52:42] <okdamn> i would avoid settimeout
[13:52:44] <okdamn> :(
[13:52:49] <BillCriswell> Why?
[13:53:27] <okdamn> cause it charges the page load
[13:53:36] <BillCriswell> charges?

[14:00:32] <Tomashe> hey guys got some issue , i use jquery mobile. and my pages are with diffrent html files , when i click on a link on page page , instead of replaceing  data-role="page" with the new content , its just adding it on what makes everything fucked up on the design
[14:00:36] <Tomashe> i need some help
[14:00:42] <BillCriswell> $('input:-webkit-autofill').animate({opacity: 1}, 0).delay(20) is probably what you want to hear okdamn.

[14:01:30] <ernston> can anyone help me pls
[14:01:53] <BillCriswell> ernston: Ask your question and if someonecan help they will.
[14:02:18] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  opacity??
[14:02:18] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/KFkw7/  this is the fiddle
[14:02:21] <okdamn> lol
[14:02:25] <okdamn> seriously?
[14:02:37] <ernston> i am trying to get the list item index number and pass it to the next function so i can remove that item
[14:03:34] <BillCriswell> okdamn: It's just putting a useless animation so you can use .delay(20)
[14:04:05] <ernston> delItem will be set to the index() of the clicked: li .delUrl
[14:04:28] <BillCriswell> It still won't work for the each though.
[14:04:59] <BillCriswell> Just realized you're trying to delay an each.
[14:06:07] <idbentley> okdamn http://jsfiddle.net/ur4re/2/
[14:06:30] <idbentley> okdamn setTimeout does call just once.
[14:06:35] <idbentley> okdamn that'
[14:06:40] <idbentley> s a simple example of usage.
[14:07:18] <okdamn> ok thanks!
[14:09:18] <ernston> can anyone tell me why this is not working: $('#favList li').eq(tempItem).addClass('ui-screen-hidden');
[14:09:29] <ernston> tempItem = depItem +1;
[14:09:54] <idbentley> ernston, what isn't working?
[14:10:08] <ernston> when i change the eq() from an int
[14:10:11] <ernston> to that var
[14:10:38] <ernston> enough though that var is meant to be an int, the li does not hide
[14:10:49] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a jquery mobile menu script that is a standalone
[14:10:54] <zizzl> the one with the sliding panels
[14:11:03] <zizzl> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/panels/
[14:11:13] <Tomashe> guys do i really have to use one page website with jquery mobile?
[14:11:16] <Tomashe> hey guys got some issue , i use jquery mobile. and my pages are with diffrent html files , when i click on a link on page page , instead of replaceing  data-role="page" with the new content , its just adding it on what makes everything fucked up on the design
[14:13:00] <zizzl> Tomashe, haha I'm having the exact same issue
[14:14:07] <ernston> how do i check if my variable is an int and not a string
[14:14:11] <Tomashe> im strugeling with it for the whole day
[14:14:18] <idbentley> ernston - without a complete example, it isn't possible to be sure, but I suspect that tempItem is not actually an int.
[14:14:21] <henn1nk> how is this namedâ¦. i am searching an script/tutorial where i can "slide" with an panel in two images. to show "pre/after" images
[14:14:47] <idbentley> ernston, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isNumeric/
[14:14:47] <ernston> thats what am thinking thats why i need to test if it is or not
[14:15:59] <ernston> $.isNumeric(delItem); = true
[14:16:05] <ernston> tempItem also is numeric
[14:16:22] <Tomashe> zizzl, the solution i found is kinda shitty, $(document).bind( "pagechange", function( e, data ) {	if ($(".m-wrap").length > 1) {		$(".m-wrap").eq(0).remove();	} m-wrap is my container
[14:16:22] <Tomashe> });
[14:16:29] <Tomashe> but this isnt working so good
[14:16:47] <idbentley> ernston - read the document more carefully.  $.isNumeric returns true for "1" -> all that it tells you is that you can safely cast it to an integer
[14:16:50] <zizzl> ah crap
[14:16:52] <idbentley> to a Number*
[14:17:13] <Tomashe> yeah its crapy solution
[14:17:39] <idbentley> ernston, parseInt(delItem, 10) will cast.
[14:19:17] <idbentley> ernston, Be careful though, parseInt will round Float values to integers.
[14:19:40] <ernston> cant get much worse than this
[14:20:00] <ernston> jesus i think you solved it
[14:20:24] <ernston> :s let me try this a few times, brb
[14:28:59] <Sna4x8> Is there something like .queue that is not per element?  e.g. something I can queue up animations for multiple elements like so: $.queue($('#item1').animate()); $.queue($('#item2').animate()).
[14:29:44] <pixelpimp> you can name the queue
[14:29:50] <pixelpimp> look it up in the manual, there are examples
[14:29:54] <pixelpimp> http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[14:31:20] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a jquery mobile menu script that is a standalone
[14:31:23] <zizzl> the one with the sliding panels
[14:31:26] <zizzl> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/panels/
[14:31:41] <zizzl> I know you can build you own jqmobile.js but not sure what to choose
[14:34:28] <zizzl> no?
[14:37:46] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[14:37:47] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/wLziFGbY
[14:38:02] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know how I can add a user.id to the form so when I post it
[14:38:09] <LoneSoldier728> I can query the user.id as well
[14:38:16] <LoneSoldier728> a.addNewLabel(data-user=userX.user.id) Add Label
[14:38:25] <LoneSoldier728> this is how I have it originally in jade before it is converted to html
[14:38:54] <LoneSoldier728> and then when I try to add it to the jquery replace bt (data-user="' + user.id +'"
[14:38:58] <LoneSoldier728> it does not work
[14:41:50] <pixelpimp> look at your output
[14:41:50] <fourcolo_> can someone help me understand "bind()" a little better. I don't understand what $.bind('blur.foo', function(){}) means
[14:41:54] <pixelpimp> doesn't make any sense
[14:41:59] <henn1nk> i don't know how this is named to google itâ¦ i would like to have 2 divs/images shown 50%. in the middle is a "slider" to shove the percents between them, for exampe 20%/80% or 70%/30% .. do u know what i mean?
[14:42:00] <pixelpimp> commas in HTML elements?
[14:42:04] <fourcolo_> I get the 'blur' part but I don't get what the 'foo' part does
[14:42:35] <pixelpimp> it's the even name
[14:42:38] <pixelpimp> event*
[14:42:46] <pixelpimp> err, type, i guess
[14:42:49] <fourcolo_> I thought blur was the event name?
[14:42:52] <BillCriswell> henn1nk: You want like... movable panes?
[14:43:13] <duch_kazatel> fourcolo_ - why are you using .bind()?  why not on()?
[14:43:16] <pixelpimp> nope, the whole thing is one string
[14:43:28] <pixelpimp> that is for a "blur.foo" event, not a "blur" event or a "foo" event
[14:43:31] <fourcolo_> duch_kazatel: it's an open source project
[14:43:32] <BillCriswell> henn1nk: http://jsbin.com/ like this?  I love that I Can use jsbin as an example with no code.
[14:43:33] <pixelpimp> "blur foo" would be a blur and a foo
[14:44:09] <BillCriswell> blur foo sounds like some weird martial arts
[14:44:10] <fourcolo_> ok so they must be triggering 'blur.foo' somewhere in their code then correct?
[14:44:13] <pixelpimp> I believe that .bind() is all but deprecated now, yeah?  .on() is definitely the better way
[14:44:14] <henn1nk> BillCriswell: yes but without scaling them
[14:44:22] <pixelpimp> fourcolo_: correct
[14:44:31] <pixelpimp> well, if the event fires ;)
[14:44:43] <pixelpimp> maybe they made a listener that does nothing
[14:44:47] <BillCriswell> henn1nk: I think you lost me.
[14:44:56] <BillCriswell> I was doing so well.
[14:44:56] <fourcolo_> that would be ... fantastic...
[14:45:07] <henn1nk> BillCriswell: i mean without scaling their contents :)
[14:46:00] <BillCriswell> you could put wrapper around the content of it with an absolute width set maybe?
[14:46:26] <henn1nk> BillCriswell: but how can i get this functionality? or is this just css?
[14:46:53] <fourcolo_> pixelpimp: I can't seem to find where they actually trigger "blur.chosen" I'm working with this open source project. http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[14:47:00] <pixelpimp> CSS for display, javascript for control
[14:47:03] <fourcolo_> pixelpimp: I'm making it accessible for blind people
[14:47:07] <BillCriswell> henn1nk: http://jqueryui.com/resizable/#default may help?
[14:47:10] <Tomashe> <zizzl : found a solution?
[14:47:14] <fourcolo_> I just need to figure out where "blur" is being called
[14:47:26] <fourcolo_> or in this case... "blur.chosen"
[14:47:31] <henn1nk> BillCriswell: hmmm don't know
[14:47:41] <fourcolo_> its a jquery plug in
[14:47:50] <pixelpimp> i'm afraid i don't know coffeescript
[14:48:04] <pixelpimp> or i'd try and help (although i guess it'd be easy to search for that term?)
[14:48:23] <fourcolo_> yeah.. did a quick search and just got the .bind stuff... nothing with .trigger
[14:49:22] <fourcolo_> does a "change" event automatically do a "blur"?
[14:49:36] <pixelpimp> it should not, no
[14:49:42] <Sna4x8> pixelpimp: Thanks - not sure why I can't get the queue to work the way I want, though.  Here's a quick example of what I'm looking for: http://jsfiddle.net/k5Ete/  I want "wrap" to slide up after all the square events are done.
[14:59:33] <fourcolo_> ok so I learned something new about .bind
[14:59:53] <fourcolo_> well bind and on
[15:00:20] <fourcolo_> so if you have a "blur" event... that also is like "blur.chosen" a straight up "blur" will actually change it
[15:00:34] <fourcolo_> so... doing a blur.chosen doesn't really do anything
[15:06:56] <zizzl> Is there any solution to getting jQuery mobile and jQueryUI to work well?
[15:07:39] <Mrgoose> I'm using jquery mobile , any idea why a loaded javascript doesn't work when i initially click the link to open the new page.  But works if i refresh on the page
[15:08:20] <zizzl> Mrgoose, are you using jQueryUI in your site?
[15:08:31] <Mrgoose> no
[15:08:36] <LoneSoldier728> how do i pass data into a form
[15:08:45] <LoneSoldier728> when I am doing a dom manipulation to it
[15:08:56] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/wLziFGbY
[15:09:07] <LoneSoldier728> data-user is not working

[15:32:50] <NodeHelp> any1?
[15:47:41] <jim_j> hi all
[15:48:17] <jim_j> does anyone know how I can do the following YUI call in jquery?  timer = Y.later(1000, null, decreaseSeconds, [], true);
[15:52:59] <zachrab> how can i check if any child element has a certain class?
[15:56:57] <duch_kazatel> you could see what $(myParent).find('.childClass') returns.
[15:58:07] <zachrab> how can i find an element by two classes
[15:58:38] <gordian> zachrab: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5844886/how-to-detect-if-any-child-elements-within-a-parent-element-has-a-certain-class
[15:58:48] <gordian> that's for your first question
[15:59:27] <zachrab> gordian: got it
[15:59:29] <kid_icarus> hi all, I'm trying to search for some clarification on events. I have a problem whereby someone is clicking on a submit button more than once and it's submitting a form multiple times. the form is an order form, and apparently people don't like being charged multiple times as a consequence of submitting the form multiple times. I'd like to disable the submit button after click, and I'm a little fuzzy on the best approach.
[15:59:39] <zachrab> gordian: how about my second question
[16:00:23] <duch_kazatel> zachrab are you trying to find all elements with two classes that are children of a single parent?
[16:00:33] <zachrab> duch_kazatel: yes
[16:00:43] <kid_icarus> I've tried doing a attr('disabled', true) bound to a .click(), and this doesn't submit the form
[16:01:05] <kid_icarus> and so I'm a little curious about chicken/egg on click versus submit events
[16:01:34] <duch_kazatel> kid_icarus what about users that don't have javascript enabled? :)  i'll bet this is ajax driven, yeah?
[16:01:40] <gordian> zachrab: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10559153/jquery-hasclass-for-multiple-values-in-an-if-statement
[16:02:01] <zachrab> got it thx guys
[16:02:08] <duch_kazatel> and zachrab - let's say it's got class "a b".
[16:02:09] <gordian> otherwise if you know the classes you can use $('element.class1.class2')
[16:02:15] <pixelpimp> do people really care about users without js for most sites?
[16:02:16] <jim_j> what's the difference between .text and .val?
[16:02:16] <duch_kazatel> just do $('.a.b')
[16:02:18] <zachrab> ('.a.b')
[16:02:21] <zachrab> correct
[16:02:21] <zachrab> got it
[16:02:36] <pixelpimp> .val() retrieves info
[16:02:44] <kid_icarus> duch_kazatel: it's a standard form, but good point :)
[16:02:54] <pixelpimp> actually, i guess you can set from .val(), can't you?
[16:02:57] <pixelpimp> so ignore me
[16:03:03] <kid_icarus> duch_kazatel: I'm just trying to rule some things out, I don't even yet know if it's user error or not :)
[16:04:04] <duch_kazatel> kid_icarus - fair enough.  if you hgave any other JS bound to the form's onclick, you can add this.disabled = true
[16:04:08] <duch_kazatel> or something similar.
[16:10:48] <zachrab> how can i loop a beep noise for the duration a class remains on an element?
[16:12:27] <kid_icarus> duch_kazatel: cool, so I've done that but then the form doesn't submit. do I need to trigger the submit of the form after disabling the button?
[16:54:23] <Onionnion> I'm trying to use jquery to subscribe an event to a certain class for spans. the spans I need to affect have class="info_entry" or class="info_entry def_color". to target this, would it be $("info_entry")... ? This feels like a dumb question but I can't get this code to work and I feel like it's in the target
[16:56:02] <pixelpimp> yep
[16:56:19] <pixelpimp> err, .info_entry
[16:56:28] <pixelpimp> . for class name
[16:58:50] <Onionnion> why this code isn't wokring I have no idea..
[16:59:18] <Onionnion> it's just preventing the entering of a carriage return via keypress
[16:59:19] <pixelpimp> the reason i just said
[16:59:53] <pixelpimp> seems an unrelated thought to your previous statement
[17:01:36] <Onionnion> well this is what I'm trying to run http://hastebin.com/lotenoqubi.coffee
[17:03:40] <pixelpimp> Onionnion: nothing wrong there, perfectly good code.
[17:07:56] <Onionnion> pixelpimp, except it's not doing anything. it is in the page's source, just isn't working..I'll figure it out later. Thanks, though.
[17:08:18] <scottiee> Must be something else going on?
[17:08:43] <scottiee> Have you ran the code on document ready. Have a look in the console
[17:09:16] <pixelpimp> Onionnion: http://jsfiddle.net/7x9mq/
[17:16:26] <Onionnion> scottiee, not that I can see. I can show the exact page I'm working on
[17:16:38] <pixelpimp> you should do that
[17:19:23] <Onionnion> the exact function is on line 136 in the source and the spans are in the "Your Savings" tab http://216.70.113.98/li_fluorescent.php
[17:19:55] <jim_j> how do you get the inner value of the html within a span ?  like <span id="day">5</span>  and I'm doing:   days = jQuery("#day");
[17:20:18] <scottiee> days.text()
[17:20:22] <scottiee> days.html()
[17:20:24] <pixelpimp> .text(), .html()
[17:20:44] <scottiee> aha, I'm gonna quite the race...
[17:20:52] <pixelpimp> you beat me :)
[17:21:20] <jim_j> thanks!!
[17:22:21] <scottiee> Onionnion: I think you're missing some brackets after your code
[17:23:00] <Onionnion> where?
[17:23:19] <pixelpimp> in the line with the error
[17:23:20] <scottiee> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ; li_fluorescent.php:34
[17:23:20] <scottiee> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
[17:23:29] <pixelpimp> look in the console
[17:24:23] <Onionnion> I saw that syntax error but I didn't see what was wrong. I'm actually bugfixing someone else's work
[17:25:10] <pixelpimp> *we're* bugfixing someone else's work ;P
[17:25:23] <Onionnion> lol yeah now
[17:25:47] <Onionnion> (I'm actually a new intern.. >.>)
[17:26:11] <scottiee> Is this meant to be a learning experience? lol have you looked at line 34 then?
[17:27:35] <scottiee> You're not missing brackets but it is in the wrong place slightly.. I had to use a tool to see the indents better. That should be enough help.
[17:27:48] <scottiee> But 34 needs fixing first.
[17:27:51] <Onionnion> yes it's because the actual line with PHP is "var lightfluorew=<?php echo($_SESSION['form']['eProjectLI_FL_existingValue']);?>;"
[17:28:29] <Onionnion> and that's returning that because of something else..
[17:30:03] <Onionnion> yeah let me explain the confusion about the line 34: go to http://216.70.113.98/index.php and then get started>continue (under guest)>lighting>fluorescent
[17:30:10] <Onionnion> going through that removes the errors
[17:30:50] <scottiee> Yeah it depends on the session to make the js valid
[17:31:08] <Onionnion> forgot about that, sorry
[17:31:15] <scottiee> But the syntax error will stop the code on the page working
[17:31:41] <Onionnion> going through that removes all errors for me
[17:32:57] <Onionnion> in chrome..new story after checking FF's console
[17:34:09] <scottiee> It works for me in chrome if I rerun your code block. You need to move the keypress section up one line
[17:34:23] <scottiee> So it runs on dom ready
[17:35:36] <Onionnion> oh I see
[17:35:59] <Onionnion> yay it works!
[17:36:13] <scottiee> Why <span> and not <input> anyway?
[17:37:28] <Onionnion> scottiee, all of the style stuff was given to us, we just had to put in the serverside backend
[17:38:38] <Onionnion> just 2 more reported bugs to fix
[17:39:10] <Onionnion> oh and I gotta put the script on all the other sites..
[17:39:55] <scottiee> Your approximate savings is NaN... would have prefered an Inf saving but aw well
[17:43:32] <Onionnion> I can say they way over-stylized the entire thing
[17:49:00] <scottiee> Maybe.. most interesting bit I seen was the 9 POST requests to save the session
[17:50:38] <Onionnion> this other bug is just again a js syntax error because that var was assigned..
[17:52:34] <scottiee> Maybe if the session is not ready force a 302 back to the start?
[17:53:07] <Onionnion> scottiee, probably a long stretch, but is there anywhere higher in the site's structure where I could put that one function and it'll apply everywhere?
[17:53:43] <scottiee> I dunno.. its your code ;) you would do it server side
[17:54:11] <Onionnion> I mean with the preventing carriage return
[17:55:45] <scottiee> Just put it in a $(document).ready(function() { CODE });   inside a js file that gets included on every page
[17:56:09] <scottiee> You have two already. You could probably tidy them altogether.
[17:59:25] <Onionnion> I wish this site's code could be cleaned up, it can be a pain to read
[17:59:40] <DarkGhost`> I'm having problems updating jquery from 1.5.2 to 1.10 how can I tell what is causing the problem?
[18:03:19] <scottiee> Add jquery migrate to your pages and then watch the console for tips
[18:03:31] <Onionnion> now it works everywhere yay
[18:04:42] <sammych> how is it that Chrome has different issues on different platforms
[18:05:11] <scottiee> Onionnion: Yeah I've wrote some messy code before but that must get annoying ;)
[18:05:29] <sammych> Chrome on OS X renders everything properly, and loads resources properly
[18:06:10] <Onionnion> scottiee, this is actually my first time working with web stuff, I have a lot of prior Java, Python, Lua, etc. experience
[18:06:12] <Onionnion> Even some Forth
[18:06:12] <sammych> but in W7, stuff is out of place on some sites, the discussion at the bottom of jQueryMobile.com is just the degraded LIs
[18:07:22] <scottiee> Ah ok, I'm more the other way.. but I've done some C, Java, Python and even MATLAB in my time
[18:07:44] <arschmitz> sammych: discussion at the bottom of jquerymobile.com??
[18:08:58] <scottiee> I don't have many rendering problems in Chrome Win7.. in general anyway?
[18:14:06] <Onionnion> this one other syntax error I'm not sure if I can figure out..
[18:20:20] <nesoi> I'm trying to get a scrolling content area between a fixed header and footer in jqm to be the right size (the size of the area between the header and footer) and am not getting it to work. Would someone be able to look at a fiddle and see what I'm doing wrong?
[18:26:44] <nesoi> oops, disconnectedâ¦ anyone good at formatting and willing to look at a fiddle to see what I'm doing wrong?
[18:29:00] <DarkGhost`> for JQMIGRATE I can't find any of the things they are saying are deprecated
[18:39:13] <Onionnion> it'd be great if the people commented their code so I'd know what the hell VAMpu meant.
[18:44:12] <Onionnion> are there any tools that can trace the creation of a variable?
[18:46:20] <Onionnion> I have this $_SESSION var that probably isn't being created because of a database issue but I can't figure out where or how or what becasue the people who made this had to make it as complicated as they possibly could
[18:46:59] <pixelpimp> that looks suspiciously not like jquery, but PHP
[18:47:16] <pixelpimp> and everyone loves overcomplicated code!
[18:47:24] <Onionnion> oops sorry wrong channel heh
[19:05:00] <f209> Hi guys, anyone here that might help me for a second with the newest version of fancybox... I'm very familiar with the original fancybox, but I'm migrating to fancybox 2...I'm displaying iframe content..and I thought if i made a iframe: {scrolling: 'no', preload: true' } in the options it would preload correctly
[19:05:06] <f209> but int is showing the content
[19:05:15] <f209> it's not showing a preload animation
[19:05:17] <f209> or hiding the content
[19:08:58] <pixelpimp> sounds like a problem for the fancybox authors
[19:14:17] <ernston> hello again
[19:14:29] <ernston> anyone around to help with a: back button issue
[19:27:13] <sammych> I'm hoping the solution is obvious and I'm just missing something: I want to find the coords of an element inside a div, relative to the div
[19:27:34] <sammych> the div will have overflow, and I want to know what the scrollTo for that element is
[19:28:12] <grafi> sound non-trivial to me ^^
[19:29:22] <sammych> great
[19:29:34] <sammych> maybe I'll just throw it in an iFrame and call it a day
[19:29:38] <sammych> kidding
[19:29:46] <ernston> i need help when someone has time
[19:31:22] <pixelpimp> clearly you don't, or you'd have asked a question
[19:31:26] <ernston> the best way to explain my problem is that after visiting a page populated from json data, the back button to that page gives me an error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'shopName' of undefined
[19:31:37] <sammych> ouch
[19:31:39] <ernston> am having trouble descibe the issue
[19:31:59] <pixelpimp> sammych: take a look at .offset() and .offsetParent()
[19:32:42] <pixelpimp> so it's trying to access an undefined variable
[19:33:12] <ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/147/
[19:33:23] <grafi> hm pixelpimp could work
[19:33:26] <ernston> click top ten,
[19:33:38] <ernston> then a list item, which shows fine
[19:33:53] <ernston> if you then click the + in top right corner, then the back button on the next page
[19:33:57] <ernston> i get the error
[19:34:06] <ernston> so the data no longer exists on back
[19:35:55] <grafi> so grab yourself a debugger and debug oÃ´
[19:36:08] <pixelpimp> oh my, that is way too much for me to look at without a paycheck
[19:36:14] <ernston> using firebug
[19:37:47] <grafi> true that pixelpimp
[19:41:18] <jwmann> Is there a way to reset the inline style jquery puts in?
[19:42:09] <gtek1k> !important on the selector?
[19:42:22] <grafi> seems like a good idea
[19:42:28] <pixelpimp> sure.  don't put it in to begin with.
[19:44:50] <grafi> probably .removeAttr('style')
[19:45:01] <grafi> that just kills the attribute ^^
[19:46:42] <jwmann> grafi: Sounds perfect, thanks!

[20:50:58] <gordian> i'm using a small script to load image height and width and want to use the height and width after the load() function
[20:51:03] <gordian> http://jsfiddle.net/SN2t6/15/
[20:51:19] <gordian> how can i use the width and height (like on line 6)?
[21:04:06] <Snerf> gordian, declare s outside of the function
[21:04:15] <gordian> Snerf: doesn't work
[21:04:21] <gordian> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9210098/jquery-variable-scope
[21:05:02] <beachandbytes2> gordian, load is an async operation so your code in that context will execute before the image width/height is defined
[21:05:21] <gordian> beachandbytes2: yeah that's what that stack says
[21:05:35] <Snerf> gordian, clearl.. load isnt finished
[21:05:42] <Snerf> clearly..
[21:05:55] <beachandbytes2> so put your code in the callback
[21:07:06] <gordian> but i'm using load() inside another function
[21:07:22] <gordian> i need its parent function to return the image ratio from load()
[21:07:30] <Snerf> gordian, makes no difference.. its async
[21:09:00] <beachandbytes2> you just need to refactor
[21:10:29] <gordian> http://jsfiddle.net/gMU7c/
[21:10:46] <gordian> that's what i'm trying to do
[21:11:02] <Snerf> gordian, dont you understand what async means?
[21:11:37] <gordian> not really, i'm a bit of a noob
[21:12:10] <gordian> but i understand that load() takes time and the function returns before the load() callback happens
[21:12:15] <Snerf> it means the function doesnt block the code... it keeps running
[21:12:37] <gordian> right
[21:12:44] <gordian> makes sense
[21:12:46] <Snerf> so, it just runs the .load.. and continues with the code.. even tho .load isnt finished.. so you have an undefined variable
[21:13:03] <gordian> yup
[21:13:16] <Snerf> you would need to use an ajax call, to read the image dimensions, that would work
[21:13:30] <Snerf> as you can make an ajax call async = false
[21:13:59] <gordian> damn
[21:14:02] <gordian> but over my head
[21:14:03] <Snerf> and you can just make it call getimagesize inside a php file it calls. that would work
[21:14:06] <gordian> *bit
[21:14:18] <Snerf> well, cant learn if you dont try :)
[21:14:44] <Snerf> how your doing it, doesnt work for what you want
[21:15:51] <gordian> indeed
[21:15:58] <gordian> to both
[21:16:15] <Snerf> unless you can make .load async, false
[21:16:44] <Snerf> which I dont know if thats possible
[21:17:06] <beachandbytes2> 1.3333333333333333
[21:17:22] <beachandbytes2> http://jsfiddle.net/gMU7c/1/
[21:18:01] <Snerf> would the return work inside the .load ?
[21:18:16] <beachandbytes2> no
[21:18:44] <beachandbytes2> you just need to wrap the code you want to hnappen after the load in the callback simple as that
[21:19:02] <beachandbytes2> If that does not work for you, your probably doing it wrong
[21:19:17] <Snerf> easier to just use an ajax call :)
[21:20:44] <beachandbytes2> and set async false?
[21:21:12] <Snerf> sure, that would work
[21:21:24] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[21:21:31] <Snerf> call a php file that uses getimagesize and return the json value.. voila
[21:21:31] <gordian> grrrr
[21:21:47] <Snerf> if all you want is the image size.
[21:21:59] <gordian> not sure my hacking skills are quite at that level yet
[21:22:02] <beachandbytes2> Still bad practice to block
[21:22:14] <beachandbytes2> what is your ultimate goal with this function
[21:22:22] <beachandbytes2> it would seem an advantage that it is async
[21:22:27] <gordian> basically
[21:22:42] <Snerf> beachandbytes, using a timeout to check the variable is just another cheap hack..
[21:22:44] <gordian> i'm trying to weave a jquery script into WordPress
[21:22:59] <Snerf> lol..
[21:23:01] <beachandbytes2> okay
[21:23:04] <gordian> the jquery script searches for image-width.jpg
[21:23:10] <beachandbytes2> Snerf don't need to use a timeout
[21:23:14] <gordian> but i need it to search for a WP resized thumbnail
[21:23:26] <gordian> which has a filename like image-widthxheight.jpg
[21:23:41] <gordian> so i need to know the original dimensions of the original image
[21:23:53] <gordian> then use the ratio to get the thumbnail height
[21:23:55] <Snerf> cant you just check the attachments
[21:24:30] <beachandbytes2> Why does your code need a syncronous response at this point in time?
[21:24:49] <beachandbytes2> Could it not collect img dimensions asyncly and then process?
[21:25:04] <gordian> no clue
[21:25:14] <tw2113> which event should i be using if i need to do stuff on dom elements that i know aren't loaded yet, but may be
[21:25:15] <gordian> basically i'm in over my head and trying to hack my way out
[21:25:26] <Snerf> thats a terrible way to check image dimensions, when you can just use php
[21:25:36] <tw2113> specifically some ajax $.get()
[21:25:43] <gordian> ok Snerf i'll try it your way
[21:26:06] <Snerf> is it an image attachment for a post?
[21:26:23] <sayd> jquery validate doesnt have a validate on blur option does it?
[21:26:45] <gordian> Snerf: it's an image file in the uploads dir
[21:26:55] <gordian> so yes
[21:27:09] <gordian> it has an attachment ID but that won't be known
[21:27:20] <Snerf> welll, then you can use  wp get attachment image src
[21:27:33] <Snerf> well, you can get the post ID if you know it
[21:27:34] <beachandbytes2> gordian, you can acomplish this easily, just wrap your logic in approriate call backs
[21:27:43] <Snerf> and go from there
[21:27:44] <sayd> ie, do i have to something like this $('input').blur(function() { $(this).valid() })
[21:27:56] <gordian> i don't need the post ID i have the image URL
[21:28:21] <Snerf> well, then you can use getimagesize as well
[21:28:57] <gordian> that much i know
[21:29:24] <gordian> ok so i just need to figure out how to include php and then pass JSON back to my js
[21:30:30] <Snerf> :)
[21:31:43] <Snerf> i have plenty of fun with WP myself.. work with it every day :)
[21:31:50] <gordian> i suppose if i do load('size.php') i'll just be back where i started
[21:32:31] <gordian> yeah this damn js plugin just doesn't play nice with WP
[21:32:49] <Snerf> :)
[21:32:54] <beachandbytes2> what are you trying to do after you load the width/height?
[21:33:06] <Snerf> whats it do?  might find a replacement
[21:33:38] <gordian> it's a responsive image loader
[21:33:43] <gordian> https://github.com/tubalmartin/riloadr
[21:34:01] <gordian> there is a WP plugin but it's needlessly complicated
[21:34:18] <Snerf> http://wordpress.org/plugins/riloadr-for-wordpress/
[21:34:22] <Snerf> oh.. ok :)
[21:34:24] <gordian> ^
[21:34:30] <Snerf> ya.. nm that
[21:34:43] <Snerf> so strip it down :)
[21:34:53] <gordian> yeah i might have to
[21:34:54] <beachandbytes2> http://jsfiddle.net/gMU7c/3/
[21:35:02] <beachandbytes2> just keep wrapping whatever your logic needs to be after the load in callbacks
[21:36:24] <gordian> what's the data object for?
[21:40:24] <beachandbytes2> I was just going to show a persistent storage option http://jsfiddle.net/gMU7c/4/
[21:41:32] <gordian> haha, Snerf the WP plugin basically does what i'm trying to do
[21:41:40] <gordian> not sure how it's doing it yet though
[21:44:22] <beachandbytes2> http://jsfiddle.net/gMU7c/5/
[21:48:41] <gordian> oh man
[21:48:45] <gordian> exhausting
[22:04:46] <sayd> http://jquery.com/?s=validate
[22:04:49] <sayd> fail...
[22:25:33] <RRR2> should I use HTML buttons for canvas, or canvas generated buttons?
[22:38:02] <duckgoose> I think it's a matter of preference
[22:47:02] <sunchips> Can someone help me with (http://jsfiddle.net/sunchips/MG7DV/). Might jut be a css issue. My mouseenter breaks when i go on top of the image or the text. I want my code to run as long as we're in the td.
[23:21:56] <krishnaveda> hi what exactly does a minifier do ?
[23:22:45] <doug65536> krishnaveda: it renames variables to very short names and removes all unnecessary whitespace
[23:23:07] <doug65536> variables that have limited scope. externally visible names keep their full name
[23:23:39] <krishnaveda> doug65536: ok here I gave as input http://www.jsmini.com/ clean neat indented code.. and as output I recieved a piece of shit which looked less like code and more like a paragraph
[23:24:03] <doug65536> yes that piece of shit is much smaller and easier for the computer to process
[23:24:23] <krishnaveda> doug65536: but not humans to understand
[23:24:27] <doug65536> correct
[23:25:23] <doug65536> krishnaveda: it is common practice to distribute the human-readable and minified versions of libraries
[23:25:40] <doug65536> krishnaveda: you can use the readable version to debug, and ship code using minified, faster version
[23:26:45] <krishnaveda> doug65536: hmm.. and the linter I used jshint.com is giving me too many use strict warnings
[23:51:20] <miCSu> why does $("<a>").attr('href','#').text("Somelinktext").get() return just the href attribute instead of the whole DOM ?
[23:52:24] <miCSu> also if it's set to a variable like: var a = $("<a>").attr('href','#').text("Somelinktext"); and then just $(a).get();
[23:52:29] <doug65536> miCSu: I wouldn't expect that
[23:53:20] <doug65536> miCSu: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/TWQGH/
[23:54:08] <doug65536> miCSu: what leads you to believe it is just the href being returned?
[23:55:10] <doug65536> if the object is implicitly converted to a string, then yes, toString on an a element gives you the link
[23:55:14] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/TWQGH/1/
[23:55:26] <miCSu> ok so it's that one
[23:55:58] <miCSu> I was trying to map element split by , and create links from them and then join again
[23:56:45] <miCSu> there was of course also .toString method to be able to join them
[23:56:53] <doug65536> yes
[23:59:14] <miCSu> naturally I can just create links with return '<a href="#">'+v+'</a>'; but somewhy I'd prefer jquery objects and methods
[23:59:21] <Elirips> will $.each(myArray, ...) iterate the array in the same way as the array is sorted? ie starting from the lowest index and going to the highest?
