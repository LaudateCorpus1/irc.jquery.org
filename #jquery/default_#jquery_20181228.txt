[03:54:07] <Woet> this is some wizard stuff, how is my loop affecting the console.log that's right before it? is there something special with objects by reference or something? https://jsfiddle.net/n6zp4y2r/
[03:56:10] <Woet> apparently I have to make a copy first to make sure it doesn't affect the parent: https://jsfiddle.net/y04mL2qd/
[06:11:44] <fattest> Hi all. Why am I getting "GraphNetwork is not a function here" ? https://jsfiddle.net/tcgju870/1/
[06:11:49] <fattest> GraphNetwork.sayHi is not a function **
[06:24:51] <Woet> fattest: you can also try ##javascript
[06:26:09] <fattest> ok

[10:31:02] <MikeD_> the event object has a target
[10:31:58] <MikeD_> is your handler function accepting the event object?
[10:47:17] <sine0> MikeD_: (this) works
[10:52:41] <sine0> MikeD_: can you help
[10:52:42] <sine0> 			var liText = jQuery(this).text().replace(/ /g,"_");
[10:52:43] <sine0> 			jQuery('li.rel[aria-data="' + liText + '"]').removeClass('hideSlick');
[10:52:53] <sine0> I need to use a variable in here
[10:52:58] <sine0> liText is the variable
[11:55:01] <Upender> hi
[11:55:28] <Upender> How is this tool useful
[11:56:23] <Upender> JOIN me
[12:19:03] <Mariaa> i want to know how can i get rid of the grey overlay on the header image https://tinyurl.com/y8gcsjnn its extending below the image.
[12:43:53] <tichun> Could I target grandparent? I target element for an user script with $('[title~=Bourbon]').remove(); but I'd like to remove it's parent and grandparent. Parent is <article> and grandparent <div>.
[12:51:48] <tichun> Sorry. Got it. that was embarassingly easy
[15:39:04] <robertmaxrees> so quiet
[16:11:37] <Flyste> I'm trying to get a value of a radio button on click but the value isn't set until after the click, is there an easy way to deal with tihs?
[16:14:20] <Flyste> Oh just figured it out, I used .change instead of .click
[16:18:49] <FLeiXiuS> Is there a way to figure out why when I click on a button I'm redirected to the top of a page?
[16:19:08] <FLeiXiuS> I'm trying to debug this issue - I have a jquery event that triggers on click, for dynamically adding fields.
[16:19:32] <FLeiXiuS> The field is added in the correct location, but my browser scrolls to top of the page.
[16:19:41] <FLeiXiuS> So I'm looking for tips to debug.
[16:19:46] <robertmaxrees> have a jsfiddle?
[16:20:42] <FLeiXiuS> It's a rails project - so it's tough. :-X
[16:20:48] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:20:56] <robertmaxrees> don't need raiuls for the JS part :)
[16:21:00] <robertmaxrees> at least seeing the code would be nice.
[16:22:34] <FLeiXiuS> I'd agree - it's using cocoon - which is half the problem.
[16:22:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:22:46] <robertmaxrees> back up
[16:23:01] <FLeiXiuS> It's a form plugin for rails - which is why I'm looking for debugging techniques in chrome
[16:23:02] <FLeiXiuS> lol
[16:23:07] <FLeiXiuS> #notmyproject :-(
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> let me show you what i mean by a fiddle heh
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u9L08g6k/1/
[16:24:23] <FLeiXiuS> I guess I'm looking for ways to view all events on a current page.  And seeing whats being called when I click.
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> so this is the issue you're currently having, right
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:24:38] <FLeiXiuS> Yah
[16:24:40] <robertmaxrees> click a link, it scrolls to the top of the page.
[16:24:56] <FLeiXiuS> yeah, I'd suspect its something in the plugins code for e.preventDefault
[16:25:01] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:25:03] <FLeiXiuS> Seeing as it's a '#' link.
[16:25:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to add e.preventDefault();
[16:25:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u9L08g6k/3/
[16:28:30] <FLeiXiuS> Yah - added the e.preventDefault - but I suspect something else is happening.
[16:28:53] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:29:16] <FLeiXiuS> https://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon/blob/1e0212f89d493cdc263b1859bcf38e391cd61ced/app/assets/javascripts/cocoon.js
[16:29:24] <FLeiXiuS> Line 40 is the click event.
[16:29:32] <Woet> FLeiXiuS: please use www.jsfiddle.net
[16:29:35] <Woet> write a test case.
[16:30:25] <robertmaxrees> FLeiXiuS what bug are you experiencing now?
[16:30:44] <FLeiXiuS> Same bug.  Is there any way in chrome to trace a scroll event?
[16:30:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:30:56] <robertmaxrees> you don't care about scroll evenmts.
[16:31:17] <robertmaxrees> you care about clicks.  you can see bound events in chrome.
[16:31:53] <robertmaxrees> *bound event listeners
[16:31:56] <robertmaxrees> go to the element inspector - in the right-hand sidebar, there's a tab that says "Event Listeners"
[16:34:53] <robertmaxrees> FLeiXiuS
[16:35:00] <FLeiXiuS> Yah I see that .  Looking for the click event
[16:35:39] <FLeiXiuS> Ended up doing a monitorEvents(document.body, "click");
[16:36:24] <robertmaxrees> you don't happen to have a return false; or a stopImmediatePropagation in your handler, do you?
[16:37:58] <FLeiXiuS> One sec, stepping through the trace.  Hopefully see which line triggers the scroll.
[16:38:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:38:35] <robertmaxrees> the scoll likely isn't being triggered by anything.
[16:42:51] <FLeiXiuS> So interesting enough
[16:43:01] <FLeiXiuS> the scroll is happening after a font-awesome call.
[16:43:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:43:17] <robertmaxrees> i give up.  good luck.
[16:43:20] <FLeiXiuS> lol right.
[16:43:23] <FLeiXiuS> It's a rabbit hole man
[16:43:28] <robertmaxrees> except it's not.
[16:43:30] <FLeiXiuS> I appreciate the click help and the debugging.
[16:43:34] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty simple.
[16:43:49] <FLeiXiuS> It's simple - just convoluted jquery plugins on top of jquery plugins.
[16:43:59] <robertmaxrees> that's likely not the problem here.
