[04:23:06] <aa435> Hi does .serializeArray encode data?
[04:41:20] <worknick> hi
[04:42:02] <Xatenev> aa435: yes?
[04:44:39] <worknick> i am using jq ui tabs. there are three tabs and each one have a table with id. can i now append tr of one table (tab) to table of another (tab) by juts doing tabl.append(this) or something similar instead of manually writing table.apppend('trcodehere');
[04:49:46] <worknick> did it.
[05:19:16] <Duikb00t> yo
[05:19:59] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/kmnbbb/  What is wrong here?
[05:20:12] <Duikb00t> When I select a correct date it's even throwing the error which it should not do :)
[05:22:54] <Duikb00t> It should not go into the if statement but it always does, doesn't matter what's the date.
[05:28:58] <lowbro> Duikb00t: you shouldn't compare those date strings, compare javascript dates instead: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/492994/compare-two-dates-with-javascript
[05:32:22] <Duikb00t> So I should convert them to date(); first
[05:45:01] <Duikb00t> Bah Im trying to do it without an other library or so... but that's not evident it seems.
[05:46:50] <Duikb00t> ( Im using jquery ui datepicker )
[05:47:05] <Duikb00t> Should be grate to populate those date to a variable. :)
[05:50:01] <Duikb00t> Bah, that not true, Im working on someone else code its' http://foundation-datepicker.peterbeno.com/example.html this :)

[08:00:43] <rokshis> Hey guys, can anyone help me with one problem
[08:01:18] <rokshis> I want to select a parent of parent element, but i can't.
[08:01:50] <Duikb00t> Setup a fiddle rokshis
[08:02:33] <rokshis> Moment!
[08:04:53] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to create a jquery autocomplete effect with jquery ui and getting the following error: 'ReferenceError: require is not defined'
[08:12:13] <rokshis> Here it is! https://jsfiddle.net/dumjxuvs/
[08:12:17] <rokshis> Anyone can have a look here? :p
[08:14:56] <shoky> rokshis: $(this).closest('.parent1').find('.items').remove();
[08:15:28] <rokshis> Hmm, give me a sec!
[08:17:12] <islalobo> I've installed jquery ui with npm and I'm trying to use autocomplete.js. I've added both jquery-ui.js and autocomplete.js to my gulp file and re-compiled my scripts. Getting a 'required is not defined' and $(...).autocomplete is not a function error
[08:19:44] <Amnesia> question, how would I capture "foo" in: <option value="dsfsdfdsfds">foo</option> ?
[08:20:06] <shoky> Amnesia: .text() on the <option>
[08:20:10] <Amnesia> ty
[08:20:59] <rokshis> shoky, for some reason, this fiddle doesnt even track my click.
[08:21:05] <Amnesia> shoky: and if there're multiple <option></option> pairs, and I'd just want the keyname for the currently selected value?
[08:21:07] <rokshis> Of course, even though it works on my website.
[08:21:11] <shoky> rokshis: might wanna include jquery
[08:21:29] <shoky> Amnesia: $('select').find(':selected').text()
[08:21:57] <Amnesia> shoky: tyvm
[08:23:27] <rokshis> thank you Shoky! Your the best <3 much love
[08:23:28] <rokshis> =]
[08:23:33] <rokshis> no homo
[08:23:41] <rokshis> even though dont know if you are a man or a women
[08:23:42] <islalobo> …it appears jQuery-UI from npm is using require which is not supported on browsers
[08:23:51] <rokshis> anyways, thank you once again
[08:23:53] <rokshis> seee ya
[08:24:06] <shoky> islalobo: you might wanna use browserify or webpack to be able to use `require` for browser stuff
[08:36:15] <islalobo> Is it possible to install typeahead.js without bower?
[08:37:55] <islalobo> Also, I'm looking into whether to use typeahead.js or jquery ui autocomplete.js — not sure if there is a recommended plugin to use for autocomplete functionality
[08:39:21] <shoky> it's possible to use anything without bower ;p
[08:43:14] <mark-use> throwing (jqueryvalidation.org) into the bin, debugging since hours and cant find out why on 2nd try .validate() wont get hit..
[08:43:14] <mark-use> which form-valdidation plugins do you use?
[08:45:25] <printForever> shoky
[08:48:38] <islalobo> shoky: last I added it we had to rearrange out whole gulp file and everything broke
[08:49:04] <islalobo> ….I mean browserify not bower
[08:49:44] <shoky> islalobo: it's possible to use it without browserify, sure, by just including the right scripts.  and i donno about gulp, sry
[08:50:56] <shoky> printForever ?
[08:57:32] <printForever> sorry shoky, I got called away by the delivery guy
[08:57:54] <printForever> can I ask for some help with Select2? I have this CustomAdapter thing...
[08:58:11] <shoky> you're asking to ask?
[08:58:22] <shoky> ;p
[08:58:52] <printForever> I'm polite af
[08:59:11] <shoky> more polite not to waste time with such questions ;p
[09:03:00] <islalobo> I'm looking at https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/#prefetch and wondering if it's possible to query a db or if the search array has to be stored as a json file
[09:05:20] <shoky> islalobo as long as you respond with json, it doesn't matter where the data came from
[09:05:34] <shoky> the client doesn't care or know if it came from a DB or from a file
[09:10:29] <islalobo> shoky: so where is has prefetch: '../data/contries.json' That could be a file that is created based on user's input?
[09:10:59] <shoky> islalobo: it's just a url. you can have the server respond with whatever you want
[09:11:10] <shoky> e.g. data from DB, or from a file, or whatever
[09:12:39] <shoky> islalobo: but `prefetch` is not meant to be based on user's input
[09:13:05] <islalobo> prefetch is the full results
[09:13:11] <decx> no
[09:13:27] <decx> you let your search run for a while querying your db directly
[09:13:41] <decx> then you have enough information to create a static prefetch with common things
[09:13:45] <islalobo> shoky: prefetch are all the values that exist?
[09:13:46] <shoky> islalobo it can be the full results, if they're small. but generally it's the initial data you want to be preloaded
[09:14:02] <shoky> islalobo but if you have lots of data then you won't want to prefetch all of it
[09:16:07] <islalobo> shoky: yeah, I think in this case there is a lot of data. We're basing it off of open data list of ~1000 records. So not tonnes and tonnes of data
[09:19:38] <shoky> welp it's up to you how much of that you want to prefetch
[09:24:17] <printForever> shoky, I'm stuck like splinter in a paw
[09:25:24] <shoky> ^_^
[09:26:13] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/8xEnTQHV
[09:26:36] <fifthshift_> hey so I'm creating a .ajax request, and in the data: field I have an array like this: "data: { field:newVal }", where both field and newVal are variables initialized earlier in the function
[09:27:00] <fifthshift_> when the request sends, it sends the key as "field" instead of as the string which the field variable represents
[09:27:16] <fifthshift_> is there an easy workaround for this?
[09:28:06] <fifthshift_> object, not array, sorry
[09:35:43] <shoky> fifthshift_: you can't put a variable as key in an object literal.  var data = {};  data[field] = newVal;   $.ajax({... data: data ...})
[09:36:11] <fifthshift_> ty shoky
[09:37:43] <printForever> shoky, pastebin no go?
[09:38:21] <shoky> printForever: what?
[09:38:28] <printForever> I've pasted a pastebin url
[09:38:33] <shoky> so?
[09:38:34] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/8xEnTQHV
[09:38:36] <printForever> well...
[09:38:49] <printForever> wth is var CustomAdapter = Utils.Decorate(
[09:39:03] <printForever> Utils - ok, I get it... there are some kind of Utilities
[09:39:09] <shoky> i donno, you put it there no?
[09:39:16] <printForever> nope
[09:39:17] <printForever> found it
[09:39:24] <printForever> its a Select2 thing
[09:39:33] <printForever> I'm trying to understand what the hell is going on
[09:39:43] <printForever> lines 25 through 34
[09:39:57] <printForever> why use inline Utils.Decorate?
[09:40:12] <printForever> why can there be two closeOnSelect... (there were two, I commented one out)
[09:40:22] <printForever> there is 0 (zero) documentation on this
[09:41:56] <shoky> i don't even know what you're trying to do
[09:42:02] <shoky> or why you copied this code from wherever.
[09:46:11] <printForever> shoky: do you know anything about Select2?
[09:46:58] <printForever> on building their CustomAdapters...
[09:47:49] <shoky> printForever: only used it for some basics.. haven't done any adapters stuff
[09:48:44] <printForever> I can't find any useful documentation... there are some stackoverflow examples and questions, but they are very niche
[09:55:20] <shoky> printForever: well one thing i can tell you is that it's wrong to pass more than 2 arguments to Utils.Decorate like you got on line 28
[09:55:46] <printForever> right, but when I put them all together, the Select2 breaks down
[09:55:47] <printForever> o.0
[09:56:08] <shoky> also pasetbin is useless, make a jsfiddle if you have problems
[09:56:23] <shoky> "select2 breaks down"  great
[09:58:05] <printForever> right
[09:59:38] <shoky> this adapter/plugin architecture is totally convoluted
[09:59:43] <shoky> and gross :|
[09:59:59] <printForever> I know, right?
[10:00:01] <shoky> and indeed undocumented. i wouldn't even try.
[10:00:17] <printForever> how can I find some documentation on it?
[10:00:26] <shoky> uh
[10:00:30] <shoky> who said you can
[10:00:47] <shoky> but if you can.... google, obviously :)
[10:01:43] <printForever> taplar: did the customAdapter thing and then he said he forgot it... who knows whats going on...
[10:02:02] <printForever> I was trying to understand what is what
[10:02:32] <shoky> well i don't even know what that code is doing, as it's on a pastebin ;p  so i'm even more clueless than you currently
[10:03:21] <shoky> might start to make sense if i actually saw it running
[10:03:52] <printForever> ok
[10:03:59] <printForever> it would take an hour to make fiddle
[10:04:25] <printForever> and then another hour to find out that no one, who can actually help, is online
[10:04:26] <printForever> ...
[10:04:51] <shoky> what do you want me to do about that? :)
[10:05:21] <shoky> it would take an hour to do nothing for an hour, too
[10:05:22] <shoky> so?
[10:05:27] <printForever> :)))
[10:05:54] <shoky> :)
[10:05:56] <printForever> Google returned absolutely no usable results on the documentation. Also, Select2 has no documentation on plugins.
[10:06:27] <printForever> Right now, I get that I'm calling "parts" of Select2 instead of the whole thing, by using the adpater.
[10:06:43] <printForever> Problem is, I don't know how to manipulate the things in the adapter.
[10:06:47] <shoky> in its "old options" docs it has lotsa shit with adapters/decorators  but no one good explanation of wtf it actually does
[10:07:09] <printForever> url?
[10:07:14] <shoky> i think you manipulate them by applying decorators to them :S
[10:07:20] <printForever> :P
[10:07:27] <printForever> closeOnSelect is inside the Decorator...
[10:07:28] <shoky> https://select2.github.io/options-old.html
[10:07:35] <printForever> closeOnSelect has True and False
[10:07:38] <printForever> I want it to be Flase
[10:08:02] <shoky> "If this decorator is not used (or closeOnSelect is set to false), the dropdown will not automatically close when a result is selected. "
[10:08:14] <shoky> so mm just don't apply the decorator maybe? adonno :)
[10:08:46] <printForever> and then it doesn't work... I think... lemme check :D
[10:09:20] <printForever> nope, still closing
[10:09:31] <shoky> so you say :)
[10:09:35] <decx> what's the endgoal here
[10:10:12] <decx> also why are you not in #select2
[10:10:19] <printForever> I am!
[10:10:34] <printForever> first message today from 4 hours ago
[10:10:35] <printForever> no reply
[10:11:41] <shoky> and the endgoal?
[10:12:28] <printForever> to keep the dropdown open, once the item is selected
[10:12:32] <shoky> if you just want closeOnSelect to be false i think you can just set that option
[10:12:40] <decx> all that stuff in the paste for that?
[10:12:46] <shoky> no need for customadapters shit i think..
[10:13:32] <decx> what's the point of keeping it open
[10:13:50] <printForever> I'm redoing the whole thing...
[10:13:53] <hellyeah> taplar: can i ask a question if you are available?
[10:15:55] <shoky> printForever: https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/
[10:16:07] <printForever> tnx shoky
[10:16:18] <printForever> I know
[10:16:29] <printForever> but... I need custom Adapter because... of who knows...
[10:16:31] <printForever> I forgot
[10:16:36] <printForever> 3 projects at the same time
[10:16:43] <hellyeah> i create drop down dynamically https://jsfiddle.net/cug0htcc/3/
[10:17:20] <shoky> printForever: so you don't even know why you need it. great plan
[10:17:51] <printForever> I remember nwo
[10:18:42] <Kamuela> The new world order? Still alive and well I'm afraid
[10:23:23] <printForever> shoky, simple question
[10:23:32] <printForever> how can I grab text without enter?
[10:23:43] <shoky> grab text?
[10:24:31] <shoky> printForever: grab text..?
[10:25:17] <printForever> I'm making a fiddle
[10:26:01] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/4/
[10:26:51] <islalobo1> We're exploring typeahead for an autocomplete solution. We're using laravel and I'm wondering if I would construct the json file in a related php controller and define the autocomplete route in routes.php http://mycodde.blogspot.ca/2014/12/typeaheadjs-autocomplete-suggestion.html
[10:27:49] <printForever> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/4/
[10:29:24] <shoky> printForever: yes?
[10:29:47] <printForever> when typing text inside the input field
[10:29:58] <printForever> and then you press TAB or click outside
[10:30:06] <printForever> I would like to convert that text to tag
[10:30:27] <printForever> I tried simulating Enter key but with no luck...
[10:36:37] <Bjerre> Hey guys! I have a problem with ordering images within a div in a horizontal direction. Right now, it counts every row up to down instead of left to right. I think there should be a way to solve it with jquery but I'm not sure. Any idea? Here is a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/mrouw07t/
[10:36:59] <Bjerre> How I want it to be:
[10:37:02] <Bjerre> 1 2 3
[10:37:03] <Bjerre> 4
[10:37:11] <Bjerre> instead of what it is right now:
[10:37:15] <Bjerre> 1 3
[10:37:17] <Bjerre> 2 4
[10:37:28] <ryanneufeld> you'll need some css to fix that
[10:37:44] <ryanneufeld> float left or float right  I'm guessing
[10:37:55] <Bjerre> I've tried so many ways man, nothing works  :/
[10:38:10] <decx> ??
[10:38:21] <decx> you use columns to do what you dont want to do?
[10:38:38] <Bjerre> ye I guess the main problem is that I use columns
[10:38:49] <Bjerre> however, it worked really great with the media queries
[10:39:28] <decx> like i delete all the css from your fiddle and it does what you want ^^
[10:39:37] <Bjerre> haha what
[10:42:44] <Bjerre> any chance you could show what you did to make it work decx?
[10:43:17] <decx> ctrl-a, del
[10:43:58] <Bjerre> the problem is that they should take up the whole div
[10:44:10] <Bjerre> so if there are 3 columns the width in total should be 100%
[10:44:46] <Bjerre> and the images should have a max-width as well
[10:45:49] <Bjerre> that is why the rows worked great, since width 100% would only be the width of one column
[10:45:59] <printForever> shoky?
[10:46:06] * hlvwrk hi
[11:06:55] <printForever> shoky: are you there mate/
[11:07:36] <printForever> can anyone help out?
[11:07:38] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/4/
[11:09:48] <printForever> are we online? wth?
[11:11:19] <shoky> printForever i got the tab working, hackily :S  https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/5/
[11:11:45] <printForever> and clicking outside?
[11:11:55] <shoky> that i did not do
[11:12:05] <printForever> can it be handled when clicking on body>
[11:12:07] <printForever> can it be handled when clicking on body?
[11:12:14] <shoky> probably
[11:21:02] <printForever> I will try to update it
[11:24:50] <printForever> shoky https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/6/
[11:25:06] <printForever> where did I screw up?
[11:28:14] <shoky> uh
[11:28:32] <SpecialTechnique> Can I clone a rel attribute and append the value to an element?
[11:28:37] <shoky> printForever:  if ( $('body').click() )   doesn't make any sense
[11:28:48] <printForever> if body is clicked
[11:29:11] <shoky> printForever: that's not what it says..
[11:29:24] <shoky> $('body').click(function) is not a boolean..
[11:29:30] <shoky> it's a call to add an event handler
[11:29:31] <printForever> oh
[11:30:05] <shoky> also you're doing .closest('select')  but it's not the <select> that's clicked
[11:30:11] <shoky> the <select> is hidden
[11:30:40] <printForever> douh!
[11:31:04] <printForever> then I will use .is()
[11:31:05] <shoky> printForever:  i can't get it  to work perfectly but maybe one of these is good enough for ya
[11:31:14] <shoky> printForever: https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/9/
[11:31:40] <printForever> lol
[11:31:46] <printForever> it adds only to the 1st field
[11:31:50] <printForever> btw. it works great
[11:31:58] <shoky> o rite
[11:31:59] <printForever> but if you type in the second field
[11:32:07] <printForever> it appends the first :D
[11:32:54] <shoky> anyways i don't feel like fiddling anymore with it, try getting it to work ;p
[11:33:09] <printForever> can I go through this with you?
[11:33:23] <printForever> 1-6 Select2 initialized
[11:33:55] <printForever> 7 we declare var elem to be this (meaning it will be <SELECT>)
[11:34:10] <shoky> ya
[11:34:25] <printForever> I dont get the line 8, is that something Select2?
[11:34:49] <shoky> most jquery plugins store their plugin instance object as data on the element you initialized it on
[11:35:04] <printForever> line 8 - declare variable inst that is comprised of variable elem appended with .data
[11:35:07] <shoky> so .data('select2') gets you the Select2 instance
[11:35:13] <shoky> which indeed is something Select2
[11:35:20] <shoky> no
[11:35:26] <printForever> cristal clear!
[11:35:35] <shoky> elem.data('select2')   is a call to jquery's  data() method
[11:36:06] <printForever> so I'm trying to call upon select2 data value?
[11:36:27] <printForever> oh I get it
[11:36:33] <printForever> we're not appending we're attaching data
[11:36:41] <shoky> no
[11:36:43] <shoky> we're retrieving
[11:37:00] <printForever> but its... empty?
[11:37:07] <shoky> select2 has already put the data there, we're fetching it
[11:37:12] <printForever> ahhhh
[11:37:13] <shoky> what's empty?
[11:37:17] <printForever> I get it
[11:37:21] <shoky> k
[11:38:12] <printForever> so we're basically, later on in the code, serving data to select2
[11:38:17] <printForever> by connecting those two vars
[11:38:25] <printForever> and attaching it to select2
[11:38:29] <shoky> serving data?
[11:38:39] <printForever> well, the typed in characters
[11:38:39] <shoky> connecting two vars?  donno what you mean
[11:38:42] <printForever> are "appended"
[11:39:02] <printForever> var elem is <select> tag
[11:39:04] <shoky> we're not touching the typed in chars, we just call inst.trigger('results:select', {});
[11:39:17] <shoky> and that makes select2  fetch the typed chars as if you pressed enter
[11:39:34] <printForever> I understand line 11
[11:39:39] <shoky> and i got that .trigger  from looking at select2 code ;p no idea if that's documented
[11:39:41] <printForever> but I dont understand line 8
[11:39:49] <shoky> ok,
[11:39:53] <printForever> it not documented
[11:40:05] <printForever> but I get what it's supposed to do
[11:40:07] <shoky> in line 1-6 we called the .select2(options)  to initialize select2 on those elements
[11:40:13] <z4c> Is it possible to configure so that the copy of an draggable element stays in position after you drop it?
[11:40:17] <shoky> one thing that select2 does when initializing
[11:40:43] <shoky> is create some object for each instance of the plugin that it's initializing
[11:40:51] <shoky> that has all its internal data/methods
[11:41:14] <shoky> and it attaches this object as "data" associated with the <select> element
[11:41:18] <shoky> using jquery's .data() method
[11:41:31] <shoky> it uses the data key "select2" when storing it
[11:41:42] <shoky> that's all done internally by select 2
[11:42:03] <shoky> it does something like:   selectElement.data('select',  myInstanceObject)
[11:42:04] <printForever> oh! so thats why the text is converted to tags inside the first select?
[11:42:18] <shoky> and then in line 8 we're just retrieving back that object so we can access it in code
[11:42:34] <shoky> "thats why" ? dono what you're referring to
[11:42:46] <printForever> is this common to all jQuery plugins?
[11:42:50] <shoky> this is just storing and retrieving data on that element
[11:42:52] <printForever> can I use data.lightbox?
[11:42:59] <shoky> it's common to many jquery plugins, not all
[11:43:05] <printForever> ok
[11:43:32] <printForever> I get it now. Something completely new to me.
[11:44:05] <printForever> first time I see $selection
[11:44:32] <shoky> that's a select2 thing. it's just a property on their instance
[11:44:46] <shoky> all properties there are select2 stuff
[11:44:54] <printForever> ah, ok
[11:45:04] <shoky> and i only knew about them by inspecting the instance object in the console
[11:45:47] <printForever> yeah... as I've said I went through that documentation like nobodies business
[11:46:18] <printForever> I managed to get few things, like on change and "select2:open"
[11:47:48] <robertmaxrees> printForever still tackling your select2 customizations?
[11:48:03] <printForever> robertmaxrees: I'm redoing the whole thing from ground up
[11:48:13] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[11:48:22] <printForever> yeah... so good
[11:50:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you'll probably learn a lot though.
[11:51:03] <printForever> yeah, and I guess I won't be using it after this project for a while
[11:51:17] <printForever> and then I will try to recall whats done before...
[11:53:53] <SpecialTechnique> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/bs1kyw4j/ - is there a reason why it still works but I get an uncaught typeerror?
[11:54:17] <printForever> shoky, if you're here I have one more question
[11:54:24] <robertmaxrees> content.appendTo isn't a thing SpecialTechnique
[11:54:25] <printForever> that is documented but it doesn't fiddle right
[11:55:06] <shoky> printForever ya?
[11:55:36] <printForever> I'm updating the fiddle to throw in the whole solution shoky
[11:59:54] <printForever> shoky http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14577014/select2-dropdown-but-allow-new-values-by-user#30021059
[11:59:59] <printForever> thing with param.terms
[12:00:53] <shoky> printForever: huh?
[12:01:03] <printForever> second block of code
[12:01:09] <printForever> so, when you convert text to tag
[12:01:10] <shoky> what about it
[12:01:22] <shoky> and where's the fiddle
[12:01:24] <printForever> the value is the same as the tag (option tag)
[12:01:58] <printForever> so how can I use that example to append or prepend text in the value when the tag is created?
[12:04:02] <SpecialTechnique> robertmaxrees: thanks! I figured it out :)
[12:04:54] <printForever> shoky, I've noticed that you can't switch the input field when trying to select the field with the mouse https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/12/
[12:05:05] <shoky> printForever i dont understand your question. what text?  who said this example is for that
[12:05:25] <printForever> I'm mixing questions, sorry
[12:06:14] <printForever> shoky, when converting text to tag by .trigger('results:select', {})
[12:06:32] <printForever> the text converted to the tag, also becomes the value of that tag
[12:06:39] <printForever> value attribute
[12:07:45] <shoky> ok?
[12:08:05] <shoky> not that i know what you mean by "value attribute of a tag"
[12:11:04] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/7mt0Lbt4/12/
[12:11:43] <arc_> i think it might be less confusing if you say element instead of tag
[12:16:25] <printForever> arc_: right, tnx... I'm mixing regular and proprietary terms
[12:50:54] <printForever> unrelated topic
[12:51:41] <printForever> bouncing the idea around. I want to display "HINT" text if the button is not pressed for 10 seconds
[12:51:52] <printForever> only after page is loaded for the first time
[12:53:06] <printForever> I believe it should be setTimeout, to check if the button is clicked, and if not show it, with 10000 timer
[12:53:22] <phelix_> when creating tabs with jquery using element.tabs({}); It is creating everything just fine. However in the controls there is a next link along with some little circle bullets used to navigate through the slides. The next text works but the bullets do not.  They have the exact same classes etc. Anyone have any idea what is causing this behavior? Is it something with how the tabs function builds these tabs out??
[12:53:32] <printForever> but I'm not exactly sure how to do it only once
[12:54:32] <taplar> setTimeout would only execute once
[12:56:36] <taplar> logically it could be something like the button starts with a class of 'neverBeenClicked' or whatever.  on click, remove it.  and on page load start the setTimeout for 10000, after which if the element still has that class, do your stuff
[12:57:01] <printForever> tnx taplar!
[12:57:14] <taplar> optionally the onclick could just clear the timeout
[13:56:18] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah everything is happening
[13:57:08] <martixy> Hey. How can i check if an event is bound to an element? jQ v2. $._data($("Mah selector"), "events"); returns undefined
[13:57:18] <robertmaxrees> v2.what?
[13:57:37] <martixy> 2.2.0
[13:57:50] <robertmaxrees> mind if i ask why you'd need that btw?
[13:58:09] <martixy> To unbind one that exists.
[13:58:17] <martixy> When it begins existing.
[13:58:28] <robertmaxrees> why not conditionally check if you should run the logic in the handler instead?
[13:58:43] <martixy> userscript.
[13:58:46] <robertmaxrees> i ask because finding bound handlers is a PITA and there are usually cleaner ways to do it.
[14:00:10] <martixy> I mean, I *can* just loop an unbind call forever and the effects would be practically the same, but out of curiosity...
[14:00:28] <robertmaxrees> it's a private API last i checked.
[14:01:06] <martixy> _data is the private api, but it returns undefined as noted.
[14:01:20] <robertmaxrees> right.  because they don't want you use the private API ;)
[14:01:38] <martixy> Right... but shouldn't that be a functionality that exists?
[14:02:19] <taplar> iirc, _data expects the raw dom element
[14:02:21] <robertmaxrees> privately, sure.  the private api can change pretty much at any time without documentation.
[14:02:27] <toocwa> instead of jQuery(window).load(function(){ jQuery(".bxslider").each(function(){ .... could you do this?:
[14:02:28] <toocwa> jQuery(".bxslider").each(function(){jQuery(this).load(function(){
[14:02:30] <martixy> tried with .get(0) as well.
[14:02:41] <martixy> Still undefined.
[14:03:09] <martixy> Actually no, error on that one, sorry.
[14:03:10] <taplar> toocwa: you wouldn't want to do that
[14:03:23] <toocwa> alright, thought it seemed a bit wrong :P
[14:03:26] <taplar> toocwa: main reason being the 'bxslider' wouldn't have the load event
[14:03:33] <toocwa> i see
[14:03:48] <toocwa> trying to make it display a loading icon or something before load
[14:03:54] <martixy> The error being "Cannot read property 'nodeType' of undefined"
[14:03:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:04:13] <toocwa> maybe i have to do that in the css and then just remove it with the js
[14:04:15] <taplar> toocwa: so just show() the loading icon
[14:04:25] <taplar> on load, hide()
[14:04:32] <toocwa> right
[14:04:58] <toocwa> i got a dodgy plugin so trying to make changes to as least files as possible, i think i know what i'll do though, thanks taplar :)
[14:05:16] <taplar> cool
[14:05:21] <toocwa> it was doing jQuery(document).ready(...
[14:05:31] <toocwa> but i had to  change that to jQuery(window).load
[14:05:37] <toocwa> because it didnt load properly
[14:05:55] <taplar> ready is not the same as load
[14:05:56] <toocwa> but now all the images appear until the whole pge has loaded
[14:07:02] <toocwa> right i think everything on the page gets loaded now and then it initialises
[14:07:23] <toocwa> before it just intialised once that div element was in the dom, regardless of if photos were ready?
[14:07:24] <taplar> yeah if you stick logic in a load that is true
[14:07:48] <taplar> ready is the markup is parsed into the dom.  load is the resources have been fully loaded
[14:08:04] <toocwa> perfect
[14:08:16] <toocwa> i thought of doing jQuery(".bxslider").load() so it doesnt wait for the whole page
[14:08:22] <toocwa> but there may be more than 1 bxslider ona  page
[14:08:28] <toocwa> will that initialise the 2nd one when the first one is loaded?
[14:08:33] <toocwa> or will it do it for each
[14:08:40] <toocwa> (hence my silly each wrapper idea)
[14:08:44] <taplar> again i don't believe bxslider would have the load event
[14:08:56] <taplar> could be wrong, unfamiliar
[14:08:57] <toocwa> oh ok i get it
[14:09:07] <toocwa> thats why i had to chagne from document to window
[14:09:08] <toocwa> makes sense
[14:09:50] <toocwa> thanks :P
[14:13:16] <martixy> No insights on the event thing?
[14:15:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:15:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/
[14:15:51] <taplar> crap
[14:15:55] <taplar> save first mark
[14:16:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e25syygd/
[14:16:17] <taplar> martixy: ^
[14:16:38] <robertmaxrees> also: that won't work for non-jquery handlers.
[14:16:45] <taplar> ^^^
[14:18:00] <martixy> Or... I assume, in a different execution context. nd there's the problem. :)
[14:18:08] <taplar> ?
[14:18:12] <taplar> the dom is global
[14:18:39] <robertmaxrees> _data is shared across all scopes.
[14:18:47] <robertmaxrees> (not sure what you mean by "execution context")
[14:20:34] <martixy> Not sure myself. Just some vague suspicions. You see, as I mentioned, this is a userscript trying to check for events bound by a scripts loaded by the page itself.
[14:20:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that doesn't matter.
[14:20:55] <martixy> Ah... okay.
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> there's no "execution context" to worry about here.
[14:32:32] <dr-peppa> Hi, I have a little problem with my script. I want to add input fields dynamically via jQuery. I managed to do that. The problem is, that I want to prohibit the creation of a new field if there has not been any input to the former one. My code:  http://pastebin.com/KTrUP9e2
[14:32:49] <dr-peppa> Would be nice if anyone could help me with some hints. THX
[14:33:27] <martixy> I give up...
[14:33:28] <taplar> looks like your trimming html()
[14:33:38] <taplar> input fields would be val()
[14:34:09] <dr-peppa> ok. so the function isEmpty and its invocation are correct?
[14:34:30] <taplar> no
[14:34:49] <taplar> like i said, it looks like your trying to trim html, which is not the same as an input's value
[14:34:56] <taplar> which would be val()
[14:35:11] <dr-peppa> I ment, if i change .html() to .val() ...
[14:35:18] <dr-peppa> but this does not seem to work either.
[14:35:34] <dr-peppa> the fields are added anyway when i press the + button
[14:35:59] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[14:36:21] <dr-peppa> this script is from a website where they have a demo. one second
[14:36:58] <dr-peppa> http://www.codexworld.com/add-remove-input-fields-dynamically-using-jquery/
[14:37:17] <dr-peppa> This is the site.
[14:37:35] <dr-peppa> there is a "View Demo" button at the end of the article
[14:37:35] <taplar> right, but your trying something and it's not working.  that's what i'm interested in
[14:38:30] <dr-peppa> As you can see in that demo, you can add as many empty input fields as you want, by clicking the plus-sign
[14:38:36] <dr-peppa> I want to avoid that
[14:39:04] <dr-peppa> taplar, sorry, better link:
[14:39:04] <dr-peppa> http://demos.codexworld.com/add-more-input-fields-using-jquery/
[14:42:25] <taplar> so the isEmpty is your attempt at this i take it?
[14:42:34] <dr-peppa> Yes ;-)
[14:43:14] <taplar> ok, and you say stop it if there is no input in the former input.  but do you mean the immediate input or any input?
[14:43:28] <hiiambo> Hey folks. I was wondering if anyone had a decent resource on a jquery script that takes the contents of a class and appends something to it (for example, an HTML string)
[14:43:51] <taplar> 'contents of a class' ?
[14:43:58] <hiiambo> for example
[14:44:24] <dr-peppa> taplar, I don't want the user to be able to click the "plus"-button and generate a new field as long as he did not input any value into the current one
[14:44:44] <hiiambo> if i have something like this <td class="random"> <span>1234</span></class>
[14:44:49] <taplar> the current one being?  the one next to the plus button?
[14:44:55] <dr-peppa> yes
[14:45:10] <hiiambo> and i want to convert 1234 to <a href="http://test.com/1234">
[14:45:18] <taplar> hiiambo: so to rephrase that.  that class doesn't have contents.  that element that has the class has contents, :)
[14:45:26] <hiiambo> yea, sorry
[14:45:52] <taplar> and you could do that with a pretty simple each loop
[14:46:34] <hiiambo> I'm fairly new to jquery, would you have a resource that explains it?
[14:46:50] <dr-peppa> hiiambo, google: each loop
[14:47:02] <dr-peppa> hiiambo, + jQuery
[14:47:08] <taplar> dr-peppa: ok, so put a class on that input next to the plus button
[14:47:21] <taplar> and find that when they click the button, and check to see if it is empty
[14:48:04] <taplar> hiiambo: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[14:48:10] <dr-peppa> taplar, like this:
[14:48:11] <dr-peppa> <input class="buttn" id="button" type="text" placeholder="Mannschaft" name="field_name[]" value=""/>
[14:48:18] <hiiambo> thanks
[14:48:23] <taplar> dr-peppa: sure
[14:48:53] <dr-peppa> does my isEmpty function work for checking ?
[14:49:42] <taplar> if ($('.bttn').val().trim()) { /* it had a value, do stuff!!! */ }
[14:49:58] <dr-peppa> I'll try it
[14:52:17] <havajsky> I often try provide feedback to MDN, Google Drive, etc. Is this a good venue to help jQuery with feedback?
[14:52:20] <dr-peppa> @ taplar: Now it does not create any new, fields even if input has been provided
[14:53:02] <taplar> havajsky: there are some dev channels, and the forums i believe
[14:53:17] <taplar> dr-peppa: show me what your trying
[14:53:22] <dr-peppa> moment
[14:53:52] <dr-peppa> html-part:
[14:53:54] <dr-peppa> http://pastebin.com/XPpJnm2f
[14:54:36] <dr-peppa> jQuery-part:
[14:54:36] <dr-peppa> http://pastebin.com/8W8Q4K23
[14:55:00] <havajsky> like right now I have a missing info for .val() documentation, is there a place where to submit it?
[14:55:40] <taplar> you should check their github
[14:55:51] <taplar> all their sites are in github so you could probably log something there
[14:56:23] <taplar> https://github.com/jquery
[14:59:38] <dr-peppa> taplar
[14:59:56] <dr-peppa> sorry, I forgot to save the html-file (with the edited class)
[15:00:07] <dr-peppa> It works now, but only on the first field.
[15:00:25] <taplar> right
[15:00:29] <dr-peppa> I is possible to insert something into the first field and then add empty fields
[15:00:44] <dr-peppa> can I prevent that, too, somehow?
[15:00:54] <taplar> what do you mean?
[15:01:50] <dr-peppa> I enter some value into the first field. Then I click the "plus"-sign. The next field appears. When I hit "plus" again (without entering value into the second field), a third one appears
[15:02:21] <taplar> so i asked before if you were only concerned with the input next to the plus button, :)
[15:02:43] <dr-peppa> AAAAHHH
[15:02:47] <dr-peppa> Now  I understand
[15:02:50] <dr-peppa> sorry,
[15:02:56] <dr-peppa> no also the following ones.
[15:03:09] <taplar> so tell me if this a true statement
[15:03:19] <taplar> if any of the inputs are blank, you do not want to add a new one
[15:03:32] <dr-peppa> Yes. Exactly
[15:04:09] <taplar> alright, so, step one.  put that same class on the fieldHTML
[15:04:47] <taplar> then, we need to check that there are none of those that don't have a value
[15:04:55] <sigma__> I'm using .scroll() and trying to get the value of $(this).scrollLeft() in the callback, but it's always returning 0. Also, it's only called at all if I scroll vertically, but that's a separate issue. Why would this happen? I can't seem to figure it out.
[15:05:33] <taplar> $('.buttn').filter(function(){ return this.value.trim() === ''; }).length
[15:06:05] <dr-peppa> So the former: if($('.buttn').val().trim())  is obsolete, right?
[15:06:24] <taplar> yep, when it was just one that was fine.  but now were looking for 'any one' that is blank
[15:06:37] <dr-peppa> ok, I'll try
[15:06:38] <taplar> and if there is one (length > 0), we don't want to do anything
[15:07:46] <dr-peppa> do I have to put it before or after the    $(addButton).click(function()
[15:07:56] <taplar> you want it inside
[15:08:00] <dr-peppa> ok
[15:08:02] <taplar> you want to evaluate that for ever click
[15:08:08] <taplar> *every
[15:08:47] <teaearlgraycold> So I just included semantic UI into a test site but it seems like the assets are not loading at all. Do I need to do more than just include semantic.min.css and semantic.min.js?
[15:09:06] <havajsky> filed an issue with jquery on github, tx taplar
[15:09:14] <taplar> havajsky: cool
[15:10:58] <taplar> teaearlgraycold: not familiar with that plugin, but one example i found just has those two files (and jquery) included in it's example
[15:11:03] <havajsky> there should be an easier way to help improving jquery docs... stackoverflow often helps, but not always
[15:11:07] <havajsky> bye
[15:13:27] <hlvwrk> more of a Marionette-related question, but how come you can't do this?    if (!this.ui.input.val()) $(this).valid(); ...?
[15:13:34] <hlvwrk> it keeps saying $(this) isn't valid
[15:13:45] <taplar> what's the context?
[15:13:52] <dr-peppa> taplar, it does not work: http://pastebin.com/LPa3WF4Q
[15:14:11] <dr-peppa> I don't think I know how to query the function
[15:14:28] <taplar> dr-peppa: take off the ! at the front and change it to < 1
[15:15:34] <dr-peppa> does not work. it does not add any fields now
[15:15:39] <dr-peppa> with or without input
[15:15:57] <taplar> update your paste?
[15:16:07] <dr-peppa> moment
[15:16:13] <zmasek> is there an issue with the ajax calls? this is the situation in which I have two ajax calls that go to the same endpoint with the http get but feed it different data (query string). the server is contacted correctly, and the response is correct, but both separate done functions return the results of the first ajax call. this doesn't happen always, but it's intermittent.

[15:17:10] <taplar> huh, that should work
[15:17:24] <NoiseEee> zmasek: no, there is not, presumably you are firing that first ajax call again.
[15:17:37] <dr-peppa> Yes it does!!!! You are the best!
[15:17:44] <zmasek> NoiseEee: impossible
[15:17:45] <taplar> eh?
[15:17:50] <dr-peppa> one brace to much there
[15:17:52] <NoiseEee> zmasek: <shrug>
[15:17:54] <taplar> lol
[15:17:58] <dr-peppa> now it works like a charm
[15:18:02] <dr-peppa> Thank you so much
[15:18:07] <taplar> :) so you understand what we did?
[15:18:20] <dr-peppa> not really
[15:18:22] <dr-peppa> the filter
[15:18:25] <dr-peppa> is the problem
[15:18:29] <dr-peppa> what does it do
[15:18:32] <taplar> ok
[15:18:47] <taplar> so when you do $(selector) that finds all dom elements that match that
[15:18:58] <dr-peppa> so far I'm with you
[15:19:00] <taplar> what filter() does is reduces those matched dom element even further
[15:19:29] <dr-peppa> now I see
[15:19:34] <zmasek> NoiseEee: it is even displayed in the network console that two calls are made and the responses are different. could it be that the browser gets confused because of the cors?
[15:19:48] <dr-peppa> it reduces the .buttn's to only those that have value ''
[15:19:51] <NoiseEee> not really zmasek
[15:19:53] <taplar> yep
[15:20:04] <dr-peppa> and if there is more than one it stops
[15:20:09] <taplar> and if there are none (length of 0) we can process
[15:20:15] <dr-peppa> Thank you taplar
[15:20:47] <dr-peppa> Got it. Wish you the best. Until next time...
[15:20:52] <taplar> tc
[15:21:36] <zmasek> NoiseEee: I have no idea what to with it...
[15:22:09] <NoiseEee> zmasek: debug / use breakpoints / see when that first XHR is being called.  http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[15:24:56] <zmasek> NoiseEee, I'll see about the breakpoints now. It makes no sense because the server is hit properly and properly responds... I'll get back with the results
[15:33:04] <PuruPuru> heyyy
[15:33:28] <PuruPuru> I'm trying to send some form data through ajax to a page
[15:33:44] <PuruPuru> but on that page's controller what i get is null
[15:34:49] <taplar> check your network tab to make sure the data is being sent?
[15:37:43] <PuruPuru> taplar, it is being sent
[15:37:51] <PuruPuru> but not sure it's being sent the right way
[15:38:07] <zmasek> NoiseEee: ok, these are the results. It hits both endpoints correctly but for some reason, the inner array in the results is of the same (first) one.
[15:38:27] <PuruPuru> it looks like this: ÿØÿà�JFIF���d�d��ÿì�Ducky�����P��ÿî�Adobe�dÀ���ÿÛ��
[15:38:29] <zmasek> NoiseEee, I don't see that anything is wrong with the code. It's just weird
[15:38:39] <taplar> in the network tab?
[15:39:02] <PuruPuru> yeah
[15:39:06] <PuruPuru> POST add_image
[15:39:33] <PuruPuru> Post: -----------------------------231111640023209 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="filename.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpeg
[15:39:41] <PuruPuru> and then it's those chars
[15:39:42] <NoiseEee> zmasek: so maybe the backend is the issue
[15:39:47] <zmasek> it's not
[15:40:16] <taplar> PuruPuru: yeah i'd say something is funky then
[15:40:56] <PuruPuru> taplar, can u look over it a bit?
[15:40:56] <zmasek> NoiseEee, the endpoint behaves correctly every time on the normal request...
[15:41:07] <PuruPuru> http://pastebin.com/VN3T69e6
[15:41:20] <PuruPuru> I think I'm sending it the wrong way
[15:41:39] <taplar> oh, your doing a file thing
[15:41:46] <taplar> so that could account for the weird characters
[15:42:51] <taplar> try commenting out your dataType key line
[15:43:10] * taplar is spitballing
[15:44:33] <PuruPuru> taplar, but i am receiving html
[15:44:55] <taplar> i'm just curious if that's fubaring something.
[15:45:37] <PuruPuru> taplar, it's not fubaring anything
[15:47:28] <taplar> ok
[15:51:02] <PuruPuru> taplar, hey
[15:51:07] <PuruPuru> taplar, I fixed my issue
[15:51:12] <taplar> what was it?
[15:51:29] <PuruPuru> taplar, in the controller I need to access that file in a specific way
[15:51:58] <PuruPuru> taplar, i thought i could just consider it as a form field
[15:52:09] <taplar> ah
[15:52:12] <PuruPuru> taplar, and get it by name, or just get all the form fields
[15:52:36] <PuruPuru> taplar, but files get special treatment. So i need to ask for them in a different way
[15:53:09] <PuruPuru> taplar, similar to how there's _GET and _FILES
[15:53:20] <taplar> ah, your doing php
[15:53:23] <zmasek> NoiseEee, not working with ajax not working with getJSON...
[15:53:53] <PuruPuru> taplar, yeah, with symfony, but i hate their forms so i won't use em + they don't work well asynchronously
[15:55:31] <zmasek> NoiseEee, like that inner results array is just the same as the first call. The response is an object that has several properties. the first level is different, but the second one is the same as the first one... like something is leaky here...
[16:01:03] <huck5> Hi, I'm just wondering if jQuery POST requests are by default asynchronous?
[16:01:13] <taplar> all ajax is by default async
[16:01:19] <huck5> thanks taplar
[16:02:35] <PuruPuru> you can make them synchronous
[16:02:37] <PuruPuru> in some cases
[16:02:45] <taplar> you want to avoid that though
[16:02:46] <PuruPuru> but that will freeze your window
[16:02:55] <PuruPuru> until the response gets returned
[16:03:59] <PuruPuru> By default, all requests are sent asynchronously (i.e. this is set to true by default). If you need synchronous requests, set this option to false. Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation. Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active.
[16:04:10] <NoiseEee> zmasek: you can try paste-binning some relevant code if you can, or try to reproduce in a reduced test case...
[16:04:56] <huck5> PuruPuru, thanks for the elaboration
[16:05:31] <PuruPuru> yeah that's for the property async: in the ajax settings key-value thingy
[16:14:54] <NoiseEee> in no way on earth should anyone be using sync ajax/xhr
[16:15:12] <NoiseEee> huck5: so if thats what you think your issue is, code  it in such a way that "sync" is not required
[16:17:52] <zmasek> NoiseEee, try rerunning it a few times because it's intermittent and watch the console. here's a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vmzr/7exgsywL/1/
[16:18:25] <PuruPuru> NoiseEee, I wouldn't know why anyone would need sync tbh but w/e
[16:21:06] <NoiseEee> zmasek: i think the only thing "goofy" going on there is that like the brief talk above ^^, ajax is async;
[16:21:14] <NoiseEee> did you want to wait until the first call is resolved before the second one runs?
[16:21:45] <zmasek> NoiseEee: nop. I don't care about the order
[16:22:33] <zmasek> NoiseEee: keep rerunning and you'll see that it calls one url but puts the results of the other one in the log
[16:31:28] <NoiseEee> zmasek: i see what you're saying but can't help think i'm missing something obvious
[16:31:48] <zmasek> NoiseEee: OK, at least I'm not crazy
[16:33:15] <zmasek> NoiseEee: the only thing that comes to mind is the mutability of the array or I don't know what... A stab in the dark...
[16:34:27] <NoiseEee> zmasek: i think its the backend
[16:34:30] <NoiseEee> one sec
[16:35:49] <NoiseEee> zmasek: its the backend http://imgur.com/alGstVk
[16:36:09] <NoiseEee> zmasek: on that screen grab, you can see the call is to "dscovr" but the actual response from the API has "ace" as the satellite
[16:36:38] <NoiseEee> zmasek: possible that the API is just not robust / able to handle/track the calls and is mixing them up
[16:37:14] * NoiseEee swallows his crazy pills
[16:37:50] <NoiseEee> zmasek: anyways, that should be proof that the API is sending you the wrong results on occasion :)
[16:38:00] <NoiseEee> i give XHR a passing grade.
[16:46:27] <claytonzaugg> How do I get jquery to accept an input of 0 when I'm using parseInt('#theNumber').val()
[16:46:48] <robertmaxrees> i think youmean parseInt($('#theNumber').val(), 10);
[16:47:45] <claytonzaugg> correct, sorry yes
[16:47:55] <robertmaxrees> so that's not a jquery problem.
[16:47:58] <claytonzaugg> I tried that, still says I need an input field
[16:47:59] <robertmaxrees> that should work fine.
[16:48:01] <zmasek> NoiseEee, I'll start blaming the server now. To see if it actually happens that the api filter is broken somehow...
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg what says that?
[16:48:45] <claytonzaugg> sorry, I have it set up so if someone forgets to input a field, I warn them to enter data before proceeding and because of the 0, it's triggering my warning on that input field
[16:49:06] <claytonzaugg> saying that I need to enter a number
[16:49:10] <robertmaxrees> what does the check look like?
[16:49:15] <NoiseEee> zmasek: hopefully that shows its clearly the API.  you can even look yourself... run the test a bunch of times, examine the faulty response.
[16:49:31] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg are you doing something like if (parseInt($('#theNumber').val(), 10)) {}; ?
[16:50:39] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, var productProperties = { onHandTotal: parseInt(+$(e.target).find('[name=onHandTotal]').val(), 10) }
[16:50:55] <robertmaxrees> clary right, that doesn't answer my question - how is then validating it?
[16:51:04] <robertmaxrees> what's the conditional it's using?
[16:51:09] <robertmaxrees> because 0 is a falsy value.
[16:51:12] <taplar> he has a + in front of his string
[16:51:31] <robertmaxrees> that coerces it to a number.
[16:51:41] <robertmaxrees> he's coercing to a number twice.
[16:51:53] <taplar> does it silently ignore giving a number to that function?
[16:52:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:52:35] <robertmaxrees> .toString() is run against whatever object you give it if it's not a string.
[16:52:48] <claytonzaugg> sorry, I tried adding the + aas a test as well
[16:52:49] <claytonzaugg> still no go
[16:52:53] <robertmaxrees> so he's coercing to a number, which then gets coerced to a string.
[16:52:54] <claytonzaugg> with or without the + it doesn't work
[16:52:56] <robertmaxrees> show more code.
[16:52:58] <taplar> lol
[16:53:02] <robertmaxrees> right, the + shouldn't be there.
[16:53:12] <robertmaxrees> but it looks like this is a simple falsy value problem.
[16:53:13] <claytonzaugg> okay one sec lol
[16:53:38] <zmasek> NoiseEee, though refreshing it with a hard response about 100 times yields always the correct api response. And the property that is not results, like property called next is messed up. I'll output the response on the server to make sure.
[16:54:43] <claytonzaugg> productInsert: function(productAttributes) { check(productAttributes, { onHandTotal: Number });
[16:55:00] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg i need more than that.
[16:55:07] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what validation library ytou're using.
[16:55:43] <zmasek> NoiseEee, sorry, the property "next" is correct, but the "results" gets messed up... makes no sense
[16:55:46] <NoiseEee> zmasek: i promise you the API is doing it.  don't just "reload" the fiddle, hit "run" over and over again
[16:55:59] <NoiseEee> zmasek: when you see a bad result in your console, examine the network tab
[16:56:11] <NoiseEee> zmasek: you can see that the API is giving you the wrong satellite name .
[16:56:13] <claytonzaugg> Let me try a few things robertmaxrees, I think you guys got me on the right path
[16:56:23] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg okay - see what we're getting at?
[16:56:27] <NoiseEee> gnite all
[16:56:32] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeeeee
[16:57:57] <zmasek> NoiseEee, I know that much, but I still need to prove it...
[16:58:05] <NoiseEee> zmasek: http://imgur.com/alGstVk proves it
[16:58:35] <NoiseEee> zmasek: results[0].satellite is "ace"
[16:58:56] <NoiseEee> zmasek: when the URL request was clearly to "dscovr"
[16:59:06] <zmasek> yes, but add format=json to the query string and try to open it directly in the browser. I'll set up logging on the server and see if the response is bad
[16:59:38] <NoiseEee> zmasek: my feeling is that the API can't really handle a lot of requests and mixes things up when its hit at a high rate
[16:59:47] <NoiseEee> zmasek: anyways... the issue is not jquery or ajax.  good luck :)
[17:00:26] <zmasek> NoiseEee, thanks
[17:10:11] <z1haze> can delay() work on its own? like without adding somethin after it? i want to just do $(this).removeClass('something').delay(500);
[17:10:21] <z1haze> so that it waits 500ms before moving on
[17:16:05] <taplar> i don't believe that will work
[17:16:20] <taplar> delay() isn't a replacement for setTimeout
[17:16:31] <taplar> it's more for functions that do animations and such
[17:17:45] <z1haze> ah
[17:17:46] <z1haze> ok
[17:21:35] <claytonzaugg> taplar, with regards to my 0 number not being considered a number, here's the verification part, but I console logged typeof onHandTotal and it's a number.  However, when it goes through this, it errors out: if (!product.onHandTotal)
[17:23:13] <claytonzaugg> It's saying that it's true, that product.onHandTotal has nothing, no value, but it does, it's a zero!
[17:23:23] <decx> 0 is false
[17:23:31] <taplar> ^
[17:23:45] <claytonzaugg> yeah, so if false is true, then it errors out
[17:24:51] <claytonzaugg> if (!product.onHandTotal) = if (product.onHandTotal is empty or null or I guess 0, it's true and error out)
[17:25:07] <taplar> what do you mean error out?
[17:25:09] <claytonzaugg> but I want it to ignore the number 0
[17:25:34] <claytonzaugg> I tell it send a warning to the input field for the user, "Please enter a number"
[17:25:48] <taplar> what are you trying to say with that expression?
[17:25:50] <claytonzaugg> So if they forget to enter this required number, it won't submit until they enter a number
[17:26:47] <z4c> is it not possibleto use an callback on hover in droppable()?
[17:27:51] <taplar> claytonzaugg: are you wanting to say "if on hand total is not set, error out" ?
[17:28:01] <claytonzaugg> taplar, yes
[17:28:14] <claytonzaugg> but because of that, it also includes 0 as meaning not set
[17:28:48] <claytonzaugg> I guess I could make an if statement for 0 and convert it to a string
[17:29:05] <taplar> i think your losing something
[17:29:14] <taplar> is it currently converting an empty value to 0?
[17:29:29] <claytonzaugg> ...that's a good question, let me find out!
[17:29:58] <taplar> cause if your converting empty string to 0 for that, and if 0 is a valid value, then your losing that differentiation
[17:30:03] <taplar> based on that value alone
[17:30:05] <claytonzaugg> if I empty the field, it returns NaN
[17:30:15] <taplar> ok, so if it is 0, then it was 0
[17:30:46] <claytonzaugg> correct, and it's a typeof number right into the validation I showed you
[17:31:01] <taplar> ok, so when would it be null or blank?
[17:31:06] <decx> well do a typeof undefined test if you want to include 0
[17:31:35] <claytonzaugg> It would never be null or blank.
[17:32:09] <claytonzaugg> but it can be 0
[17:32:21] <taplar> and 0 is good?  > 0 is bad?
[17:32:40] <claytonzaugg> any number is good
[17:32:53] <claytonzaugg> I just don't want an empty field, I want them to enter a number
[17:33:03] <robertmaxrees> .length of the value
[17:33:06] <robertmaxrees> .val().length
[17:33:49] <claytonzaugg> what do you mean robertmaxrees? if .val().length = 0
[17:33:57] <claytonzaugg> THEN error out?
[17:34:09] <claytonzaugg> Hot diggity dog, I think that'll work!!!  Thank you! Let me give it a try.
[17:34:12] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what exactly your code looks like (i just came bacl)
[17:34:14] <taplar> i'm lost.  you say any number is good, and you said it's always a number...
[17:34:26] <robertmaxrees> but you want to check the length of the field, not the value.
[17:34:28] <robertmaxrees> since 0 is falsy.
[17:36:01] <claytonzaugg> taplar, I need them to identify if they have 10 on hand or 0 on hand, so entering a number is what I'm trying to do.  Leaving it empty may have been a mistake on their end, not necessarily leaving it blank because they don't have any. I want them to tell ME they don't have any on hand.
[17:36:49] <taplar> so, onHandTotal is not always a number?
[17:37:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:37:31] <claytonzaugg> oh boy, this sounds like fun, but gosh dangit you know what I mean ;)
[17:37:42] <taplar> not really
[17:37:56] <robertmaxrees> he wants to know if there's a value.
[17:38:01] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't matter what the value is.
[17:38:24] <claytonzaugg> correct robertmaxrees
[17:38:26] <taplar> but he said it was never null or blank...
[17:38:38] <robertmaxrees> .length
[17:38:40] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use that.
[17:43:20] <Saint_Isidore> So I'm new to ajax and I'm trying to create wordpress pagination within a custom theme. I'm close but when I click the page number or prev or next links it just keep pulling in the same blog post.  Would really appreciate some advice on this.
[17:43:32] <robertmaxrees> dunno what your code is yo.
[17:44:35] <claytonzaugg> okay I'm obviously not understanding this, here's my updated code, but it's taking everything, the 0, as well as NaN if I don't input anything.  if (product.onHandTotal.length < 1)
[17:44:52] <Saint_Isidore> my on click event is here: http://paste.ofcode.org/eCuNJaW32wTHhMgRgFcHJP
[17:44:57] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle of your code, claytonzaugg?
[17:45:14] <claytonzaugg> One sec
[17:45:35] <robertmaxrees> because without context it's really hard to help you.
[17:45:38] <Saint_Isidore> my functions file is here: http://paste.ofcode.org/38uZKL2TGAPVmqP5rWJX8rp
[17:45:45] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:45:59] <robertmaxrees> Saint_Isidore what specific js question do you have?
[17:46:37] <Saint_Isidore> robertmaxrees I'm trying to figure out why my ajax call is not getting the next post
[17:46:54] <claytonzaugg> I don't know how to jsfiddle this one robertmaxrees, but I can gist it
[17:46:55] <robertmaxrees> oops
[17:49:46] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, here you go: https://gist.github.com/claytonzaugg/844655f3c7b3916cfe14
[17:50:19] <robertmaxrees> you need to change onHandTotal: parseInt($(e.target).find('[name=onHandTotal]').val(), 10),
[17:50:45] <robertmaxrees> use a ternary there and fill in the value as appropriate.
[17:51:27] <claytonzaugg> Okay, let me try real quick and verify with you
[17:53:30] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, onHandTotal: ($(e.target).find('[name=onHandTotal]').val().length != 0) ? parseInt($(e.target).find('[name=onHandTotal]').val(), 10) : NaN,
[17:54:00] <Dirain> Question: what does this do: $('selector', variable);
[17:55:11] <Dirain> is that the same as $('selector, otherselector');
[17:55:14] <claytonzaugg> or robertmaxrees, I updated my gist https://gist.github.com/claytonzaugg/844655f3c7b3916cfe14
[17:57:40] <Dirain> ?
[17:58:42] <ngharo> Dirain: it's explained in the docs pretty clearly
[18:00:45] <Dirain> ngharo: I am failing to find the first one in the documentation. must be looking in the wrong place.
[18:01:39] <ngharo> Dirain: here ya go http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-selector-context
[18:01:46] <ngharo> bits about selector context
[18:01:55] <Dirain> thank you
[18:01:59] <ngharo> np
[18:05:12] <Dirain> that helped a lot. I was looking in the wrong place.
[18:06:11] <claytonzaugg> man, I never knew nothing could be so full of something...
[18:44:20] <deadevilboy> hi guys
[18:44:22] <deadevilboy> ;)
[18:44:50] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: hi, how are u?
[18:45:08] <robertmaxrees> long day so far.  in a meeting.
[18:45:25] <deadevilboy> oh gosh.. terrible day then.. I hope it gets better now
[18:45:43] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[18:45:46] <robertmaxrees> meetings aren't bad.
[18:45:53] <robertmaxrees> some meetings are.
[18:45:56] <robertmaxrees> this one's OK.
[18:45:57] <taplar> everyone needs naptime
[18:46:01] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:46:10] <robertmaxrees> this is actually kind of important.

[18:52:02] <Mark__> does anyone know any good parallax js?
[19:33:58] <mrk> hi someone  can help me with this little get request? http://pastebin.com/J9sbJwAm
[19:34:16] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[19:34:16] <mrk> I need a auto update but i dont got it
[19:34:25] <mrk> only 1 time
[19:34:29] <robertmaxrees> what does the actual JS look like?
[19:34:39] <robertmaxrees> not the php side of things.
[19:35:46] <robertmaxrees> oh, i see what you're trying to do here - code generation is scary business, but kill the () in the setInterval
[19:36:07] <robertmaxrees> so the code is just setInterval(reloadComments, 2000); and not setInterval(reloadComments(),2000);
[19:36:18] <robertmaxrees> also: this assumes an ajax call will finish before the next one starts
[19:36:39] <mrk> ahh
[19:36:39] <promet> I'm working on some jquery powered tabs, and notice that when I do a page refresh, the page reloads the home page, i.e. the "first" tab. Is there a way to make page reloads "stick" to the tab the refresh is initiated from?
[19:37:03] <mrk> is just () sir
[19:37:05] <robertmaxrees> promet sure - set a page hash or something similar.
[19:37:10] <robertmaxrees> mrk huh?
[19:37:10] <mrk> very thanks robertmaxrees
[19:37:17] <mrk> now works :D
[19:37:21] <robertmaxrees> kay.
[19:38:27] <promet> robertmaxrees, the tab names are associated with hashes. I'm not sure how to make a browser page reload address those though. Can you refer me to something?
[19:38:30] <promet> Thanks, btw
[19:38:37] <robertmaxrees> promet read the hash on pageload.
[19:42:33] <PayMeInSteak> https://jsfiddle.net/2Lnn0fq2/2/ how can i speed up this animation? using css tranition attributes gives me a delay i cant get rid of. any suggestions appreciated
[19:43:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean just have it run faster?  or perform better?
[19:43:14] <PayMeInSteak> speed up the visuals
[19:43:23] <PayMeInSteak> im sorry if im not asking correctly
[19:43:30] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[19:43:32] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/animate/ is what you wnat.
[19:43:33] <robertmaxrees> *want
[19:43:39] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain how to make it faster.
[19:43:50] <robertmaxrees> specifically, the duration option is what you're looking for.
[19:44:08] <PayMeInSteak> oh okay
[19:44:30] <PayMeInSteak> thanks for the help!
[19:44:34] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:46:30] <PayMeInSteak> its input the same as the inputs that are being animated?
[19:46:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:46:46] <PayMeInSteak> like duration: ##
[19:46:56] <robertmaxrees> you mean the other options?
[19:46:59] <PayMeInSteak> yes
[19:47:11] <robertmaxrees> look at the docs.
[19:47:11] <robertmaxrees> they explain it.
[19:47:39] <robertmaxrees> there are two signatures - .animate( properties [, duration ] [, easing ] [, complete ] ) and .animate( properties, options )
[19:48:26] <robertmaxrees> you could just pass the duration as the second argument or pass an object as the second arg, and that would have the duration property in it.
[21:46:29] <tiredandconfused> can someone help me figure out why this site is throwing that easing error?

[22:53:23] <spreaderman> I am a complete newbie to jquery.  I have been looking for several days for a good tutorial on how to handle a simple on/off enable/disable 1/0 button and update a mysql db.  Does anyone know if a tutorial like that?
