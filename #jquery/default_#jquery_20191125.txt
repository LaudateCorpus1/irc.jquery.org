[06:04:13] <_d2k> Hey guys, it's been a long time since I've got to be here! I guess I have a rather simple question / a small issue to be solved! I would be thankful for any help!
[06:04:21] <_d2k> The problem (msg #1): I have a layer that should only be displayed once accross the entire site. For this to be accomplished I found a script on Stackoverflow and I've modified it to fit my requirements
[06:04:27] <_d2k> The problem (msg #2): Theres a button to close that layer, but somehow the layer appears after going to another sub-page of the site and only disappears after pressing reload or with other script setups it appears a couple of times after going to a sub-page. This is strange I guess!
[06:04:37] <_d2k> The problem (msg #3): Here's the script: https://jsfiddle.net/sb183juv/   - a testing environment can be found here: klaiss.org/test/historia.html (you will to toggle the device toolbar)
[06:06:04] <_d2k> the problem (msg #4): with the current script the layer keeps on showing and won't disappear untill manual browser reload button is pressed
[06:07:31] <_d2k> note: the console shows errors for another script that does not belong to this issue and that I just did not resolve yet. You can ignore those console errors
[06:20:25] <_d2k> hint: I am using LocalStorage in order to accomplish this. I've also tried it with Query.Cookie. Both approaches are welcome to be solved! I will now also review my Code Snippets because I think long time ago I had something with Cookies that worked very well.
[07:22:38] <Cork> _d2k: you have a double negative, it is prob simpler to get it to work by checking if greeting is true, if not show it (and set the value to true)
[07:22:48] <Cork> then you don't have to do anything except fade it out on close click
[07:23:12] <Cork> currently you have a double negative as you remove the value on click and then check for none existance
[07:54:34] <_d2k> @Cork Hey Cork, nice to talk to you again! Thank you very much for your answer! I will now apply your suggestion and I will post any results on it on the asap! :)
[08:29:34] <_d2k> @Cork I've now got it to work! I applied your suggestion - I'm just not sure if my approach is fully correct. Would you be so kind and review the code one more time, please? klaiss.org/test/historia.html (info: to see good results you will have to clear the application storage)
[08:31:49] <_d2k> @Cork You will also have to toggle the device toolbar in order to view the mobile first layout since this LocalStorage solution is aiming at mobile users only
[08:36:09] <_d2k> @Cork I case you just want to see the snippet: https://jsfiddle.net/Lk24xcwd/
[08:39:11] <Cork> _d2k: does it work better?
[08:40:50] <_d2k> @Cork It works perfectly but theres something wrong with the code. I wrote: if(!hasSeenGreeting == true){ ... } - the "!" must be wrong I guess
[08:41:11] <Cork> if(!!hasSeenGreeting) {}
[08:41:27] <Cork> ! in this case it to convert the value to be truty
[08:41:41] <Cork> ! to invert and !! to duble invert it (truty)
[08:44:47] <_d2k> @Cork Oh I see, my bad! I guess I need some sleep!
[08:45:25] <_d2k> @Cork updated fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/pymqnk7f/   Now works flawlessly!!
[08:45:31] <Cork> what getItem does is check if there is an entry for greeting, and then you check the not null of that value (if i remember localstorage correctly)
[08:46:32] <Cork> so ya localStorage.setItem('greeting', 'this could be anytning what so ever')
[08:46:50] <Cork> cause you never actually check hat
[08:46:53] <Cork> *that
[08:46:56] <_d2k> @Cork We created another super slim, super clean and super lean code for the Hall of Fame!
[08:47:34] <Cork> _d2k: heh as long as you're happy :)
[08:48:30] <_d2k> @Cork Nothing less than the best is good for me! Well to be honest I always need you for those best case solutions!
[08:50:14] <_d2k> @Cork Uh btw I think I still own you lotta Beers! Do you accept Dogecoin and are willing to wait till I finish the project and get the first revenue?
[08:50:50] <Cork> _d2k: i don't need anything, happy to help
[08:51:36] <_d2k> @Cork Maaan, you're not just a god to me! You're also an angel! Thank you so so much mate!!
[08:52:07] <Cork> np
[08:55:47] <_d2k> @Cork Now have a great one! I will be back sooner or later I guess! :)
[08:55:55] <Cork> same
[14:48:59] <robertparkerx> How come $(this).val() == '' isn't firing when the input has been backspaced and is empty
[14:50:10] <robertparkerx> on change or keyup
[14:52:33] <robertmaxrees> it does: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cdn50g4j/1/
[14:53:02] <robertparkerx> I tried here https://jsfiddle.net/wvjk41pf/
[14:53:30] <makr8100> seems to be working fine for me
[14:53:35] <robertmaxrees> because you don't have jquery included there.
[14:53:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7bpcL4rz/
[14:53:56] <robertparkerx> LMAO
[14:53:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:54:13] <makr8100> I typically use $('input').on('change, input', function() { ... } ) but yeah should be good....
[14:54:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't use commas for those.
[14:54:45] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[14:54:47] <robertmaxrees> just spaces.
[14:55:00] <makr8100> eh, probably right, wasn't looking closely
[14:55:35] <robertparkerx> ty
[14:55:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:55:52] <robertmaxrees> though binding both change and input is kind of redundant.
[14:57:34] <makr8100> I can't remember exactly why I started doing that cuz it was a while ago, but I do remember it had to do with copy/paste and something else to do with selects
[14:58:16] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:58:30] <makr8100> $(document).on('change input', '.filterBar input, .filterBar select', function() { });
[14:58:47] <robertmaxrees> ah, sharing a handler between inputs and selects.
[14:58:53] <makr8100> Out of my current project, but yes starting about 5 years ago that's what everything I write looks like
[14:59:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:59:57] <makr8100> iirc paste doesn't fire change but selects don't fire input, or at least didn't at the time I started doing that
[15:00:11] <makr8100> but my memory of that long ago is vague to say the least
[15:00:20] <robertmaxrees> change fires when the input loses focus.
[15:00:57] <makr8100> ah, that makes sense then
[15:01:13] <makr8100> I wanted (and always do want) instant update
[15:01:23] <robertmaxrees> sure.  that's what input is for :)
[15:08:24] <robertparkerx> I cannot believe I forgot that and asked a question. I'm sorry.
[15:08:39] <robertmaxrees> nah - it's all good :)
[15:08:57] <robertmaxrees> stuff like that happens all the time.
[15:22:38] <robertparkerx> why can I not have a click listener for classes and elements that are .html by a get request
[15:22:47] <robertparkerx> It doesn't seem to catch any of them
[15:23:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[15:23:36] <robertmaxrees> you can only bind to things that exist at the time of binding.
[15:23:45] <robertmaxrees> you want to use delegated handlers instead.
[15:24:16] <robertparkerx> can you explain or show a example
[15:24:26] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events check this out - make sure you read everything, including both of the examples.
[15:29:04] <robertparkerx> by the example would this work
[15:29:07] <robertparkerx> $( ".customerForm" ).on( "click", ".record", function() {
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't have your code in front of me so I have literally no way of knowing what element will exist on pageload and what you're adding dynamically :)
[15:30:02] <robertmaxrees> does .customerForm exist on pageload?  and is it an ancestor of .record?
[15:30:08] <robertparkerx> genius robertmaxrees
[15:30:11] <robertparkerx> genius
[15:30:13] <robertparkerx> it worked
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:30:22] <robertparkerx> I'm bookmarking
[15:30:26] <robertmaxrees> cool
[15:40:25] <makr8100> Oh god you guys have the same color nicks in my chat, thought I was talking to one person D:
[15:40:27] <makr8100> lmao wow
[15:43:49] <makr8100> robertparkerx: It works because the element '.customerForm' existed at the time you bound the event, the child search does not have to exist until later.  You can bind all the way up to the document object if you'd like, but you'll take a performance hit for going that broad.  Only go up as high as necessary
[15:44:16] <robertmaxrees> he read the docs :)
[15:44:51] <makr8100> Right, I mainly typed that out to point out you *can* bind to $(document), but just because you can doesn't mean you should
[15:44:58] <robertmaxrees> fair point.
[15:46:01] <makr8100> i.e. what I did for a long time til I realized how bad it can actually get, although I still do get pretty broad if I'm AJAXing in a ton of stuff, especially nested
[15:46:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue at that point you shouldn't be using jquery
[15:47:49] <robertparkerx> Makes sense
[15:48:08] <makr8100> I'm beginning to phase it out because I've started using vuejs, but have a ton of events plus all ajax calls themselves in jquery so that makes it a bit more difficult
[15:48:21] <robertmaxrees> *event handlers ;)
[15:48:32] <makr8100> fair enough lol
[15:50:10] <makr8100> although I'm now questioning sticking with vue because I don't like the direction vue 3 is going and I have a friend pushing me to get on board with Angular
[15:52:38] <makr8100> NestJS with Angular, took a bit to remember what he was talking about
[20:23:59] <robertparkerx> How could I perform a action on 1st click and perform a different action on 2nd click. Then after 2nd click it goes back to 1st.
[20:25:55] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[20:29:34] <robertmaxrees> i ask because that's a strange request - wanna make sure i'm not about to suggest something unhelpful
[20:30:39] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx
[20:32:37] <robertparkerx> Well I want a checkbox to remove and add readonly
[20:32:59] <robertparkerx> if checked remove readonly if not add readonly. on page load it has readonly.
[20:33:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:33:57] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with flipping behavior for just the second interaction?
[20:35:47] <robertparkerx> You asked what I was trying to build.
[20:36:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the interaction sounds really strange.
[20:36:48] <robertparkerx> it was part of a design
[20:36:50] <robertmaxrees> either way, you could stick a data attribute on the element and use that.
[20:37:29] <robertmaxrees> it can store the count of the number of clicks.
[20:40:43] <robertparkerx> $().on('click', function() { //routine }, { //routine }); doesn't work?
[20:40:55] <robertmaxrees> huh??
[20:41:11] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle with the actual code?
[20:42:43] <robertparkerx> I'm going to create your suggestion
[20:42:47] <robertparkerx> I had the wrong idea
[20:43:01] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what  $().on('click', function() { //routine }, { //routine }); is supposed to be.
[20:43:09] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "routine"?
[20:43:21] <robertparkerx> actions??
[20:43:38] <robertmaxrees> ???
[20:43:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:43:42] <robertmaxrees> so confused right now.
[20:44:01] <robertparkerx> just something like $("input").prop("readonly", true);
[20:44:18] <robertmaxrees> erm
[20:44:18] <robertparkerx> $("input").removeAttr("readonly");
[20:44:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4oqt5c8b/
[20:44:27] <robertmaxrees> you mean like this???
[20:44:46] <robertparkerx> yes
[20:44:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not even valid JS.
[20:45:08] <robertparkerx> I had the wrong idea
[20:45:20] <robertmaxrees> were you trying to, like, supply two functions to on?
[20:46:51] <robertparkerx> yes with click
[20:46:58] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah, no.
[20:48:09] <robertmaxrees> first off, that second arg would have to start with function() { to even be valid JS.  secondly, you can check the docs to see what the different available method signatures are.
[21:48:45] <robertparkerx> I used the data attribute.
