[00:02:58] <carel> Hmm.. the get request reads as "GET test?number=3" according to firebug I'll check the django dump for what it's receiving
[00:10:40] <carel> Hi sacho_  that took a minute or two I'm on firefox. Firebug shows network communication which shows that "GET site?number=3" is being sent. While my django get dict (I dump the request) shows {'number' : [u'3']} so it appears as it's being converted to a unicode string ? If i follow correclty.
[00:11:06] <sacho_> ask django
[00:31:22] <carel> I shall try them thank you for you help sacho_  have a great day :)
[00:40:09] <P0RK_> anybody good with css inset shadows?

[02:03:38] <washeul> i mean to say after just click i want my script to get the id of that div
[02:03:43] <washeul> any idea
[02:13:16] <Kottizen> Hello! Outside of my <table>, which is populated with rows, I have a <div>. Now I would like to be able to drag and drop rows from the table to the div. How do I accomplish that in the easiest way possible?
[02:30:21] <washeul> helloooooooooo
[02:30:30] <washeul> anyone online
[02:40:03] <hotcockdotcom> whats the right way to center/stretch a bg img? right now im using background: url('asdf.jpg') center center
[02:46:26] <izarry> hotcockdotcome, you can use this in your css background: url(../images/background.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed; background-size:cover;
[02:50:34] <hotcockdotcom> perfect ill try that
[03:15:15] <washeul> hi i have a form which can have multiple divs created by user now how can i identify those divs ,i am abel to identify the static ones but that same script is not applicable for dynamic once http://laravel.io/bin/6VRKV
[04:06:58] <Arvar> can someone help me with 2 problems?
[04:07:10] <Arvar> kinda out of options, tried alot of things
[04:12:52] <_rgn> no one can help you if you don't explain your issue
[04:13:46] <Arvar> well, problem 1 is: I loop through all divs which contain the ID "object", and I set the left position of these divs -1, which works fine etc, except that it just does it for 1 div
[04:14:32] <_rgn> you need to put you code somewhere. gist.github.com or jsfiddle
[04:14:33] <Arvar> and problem 2, well occurs when problem 1 is fixed, I tried to fix it a different way, which worked sortof, but aint a good solution at all
[04:14:40] <Arvar> sure, sec
[04:17:09] <Arvar> http://jsfiddle.net/8rb03hy5/1/
[04:17:16] <Arvar> the pictures dont work, but that aint a problem really
[04:17:22] <Arvar> just press "Start Game"
[04:17:39] <Arvar> basically what I'm trying to accomplish is that it moves the newly created divs to the left
[04:17:52] <Arvar> instead, it just does one div, until it's at the end, and then goes to the next one and moves that one
[04:18:00] <Arvar> I want them all to move to the left at once
[04:19:21] <Jamal1337> Hi, can anybody tell me how it is possible to change the url after clicking on an image and showing it in the overlay, like facebook does? to create an individual share link
[04:19:51] <Arvar> mm, not sure what you mean
[04:20:09] <Arvar> like, showing the image infront of the screen with the replies next to it?
[04:28:45] <Arvar> rgn are you dutch?
[04:31:13] <_rgn> nope
[04:31:44] <Arvar> oh, oke
[04:31:58] <Arvar> found anything that could provide the fix?
[04:34:11] <_rgn> i was hoping for a bit more reduced example that would demonstrate the problem with the minimal amount of code possible 8-)
[04:35:00] <Arvar> not sure if that's possible lol, as it requires everything to show you how it works, really
[04:35:11] <Arvar> but what you wanna focus on is the .each loop in the update function
[04:35:22] <Arvar> which doesnt function correctly
[04:38:18] <_rgn> are you aware that at any time there should only be one instance of any id
[04:38:30] <Arvar> oh shit
[04:38:34] <Arvar> totally forgot about that, lol
[04:38:57] <pushpa> Hi, been frying my brain a little bit with slideToggle(), I am simply trying to use it on classes, it only seem to work if I put the toggle class right after the trigger class, if I put the toggle class as in this example it does not work: http://jsfiddle.net/tys1xqxb/    Any ideas?
[04:39:43] <pushpa> sorry it was a stupid example
[04:39:50] <pushpa> will improve it and get back :)
[04:40:00] <Arvar> lol it works now
[04:40:21] <Arvar> cant believe that's the problem ll
[04:40:27] <Arvar> well, thanks :)
[04:41:51] <Jamal1337> Arvar: I mean a photo gallery where you can switch the photos in an overlay and every time you switch a photo, the url changes without being loaded, so if you want to share the link of a photo you directly have the correct link
[04:42:56] <Arvar> was talking to _rgn, but lemme take a look at your problem :P
[04:43:21] <Arvar> oh wait you're the one with that thing
[04:43:24] <Arvar> yea, #mindfuck, xD
[04:43:44] <Arvar> oh like that
[04:43:45] <pushpa> Ok here's the updated one   This does not work -> http://jsfiddle.net/tys1xqxb/1/     This works ->  http://jsfiddle.net/tys1xqxb/3/   Question: How do I make the first one work? I need to be able to put the Toggle class after the table.
[04:46:14] <pushpa> Have googled but cannot figure it out
[04:46:36] <Arvar> @Jamal1337: you mean changing the URL?
[04:49:23] <Arvar> @pushpa, not sure why it doesn't work
[04:49:44] <Arvar> it's gotta be in the HTML as the JS is still the same
[04:51:17] <pushpa> Maybe it needs to be within same parent object when using classes, for it to be able to keep track on which is which
[04:52:29] <Jamal1337> Arvar: yes but without loading the url, just change the adress in the adress field of the browser
[04:58:51] <Arvar> hmm, not sure how you could accomplish that tho
[05:07:25] <roysegall> Hi, i need help with $.post in jquery: how am i adding the post values?
[05:09:54] <herm1t> $.post('http://url.com', {varname: 'varvalue', foo: bar}, function(res) {console.log(res)});

[05:12:48] <herm1t> Could you try "data: data," ?
[05:13:09] <herm1t> instead: data: JSON.stringify(data),
[05:14:38] <roysegall> herm1t Nope. When printing the $GLOBALS the informations sent to HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA
[05:15:13] <herm1t> try it please )
[05:15:28] <roysegall> herm1t, what?
[05:16:10] <herm1t> or try
[05:16:11] <herm1t> $data = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"), true);
[05:16:15] <herm1t> on backend
[05:16:20] <herm1t> =)
[05:16:50] <roysegall> it's not my backend. It's a module in drupal. Their use case is angular. But i'm trying to do this one jquery
[05:18:27] <herm1t> i see
[05:20:06] <roysegall> herm1t, wait! i can se the backend does got the values. I think i send the reques to the wring route.
[05:21:19] <herm1t> sorry, ill be back on 15 mins
[05:29:33] <roysegall> herm1t, it worked!!! the routing was wrong.
[06:06:36] <herm1t>  roysegall, great

[06:24:03] <frank_o> Howdy! I'm using two JS libs that both share the same namespace (http://snapsvg.io/ and http://jakiestfu.github.io/Snap.js/), so using them at the same time will crash them both. Is there something I can do other than manually renaming the namespace of either one of them?
[06:42:49] <decx> get rid of snap.js their site looks shit and there's a billion nicer push-menu plugins, and snap.svg is the new juggernaut in svg libs so you want to keep that
[06:46:25] <frank_o> decx: can you recommend some?
[06:46:48] <decx> hammer.js + css
[06:47:01] <frank_o> http://jakiestfu.github.io/Snap.js/ isnt really a site just a demo though
[06:47:14] <decx> i just dont like the colour scheme ^^
[06:47:53] <frank_o> hehe
[06:48:11] <frank_o> decx: https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/ gotta admit that looks kinda impressive though right?
[06:49:12] <frank_o> currently using it with jquery mobile and iscroll without any problems. would use the native jqm panel but it doesnt support overflow scrolling nor is it compatible with iscroll so
[06:50:38] <decx> well its on github so implement the ability to have a noconflict mode ^^
[06:50:51] <decx> i'm sure they will be grateful
[06:51:05] <frank_o> nice didnt know i could do that
[06:51:58] <frank_o> the author is painfully slow to respond though so was hoping there was a way without modifying it
[06:54:02] <decx> make a new demo with a horizontal swipe for impulse, like this: http://www.luster.io/demo-pull-down-menu/ if it's good zach will put it on the demo page ( http://impulse.luster.io/examples.html )
[06:55:49] <frank_o> wow what is that
[06:56:19] <decx> impulse.js is 60fps physical animations for desktop&mobile
[06:58:14] <frank_o> very very cool
[06:58:31] <frank_o> definitely adding this to my todo :) thanks decx
[06:58:38] <frank_o> know of any other cool libs like that while we're at it?
[06:58:43] <decx> get in on that as soon as possible. it'll blow up

[07:19:16] <decx> split the chars into elements
[07:21:00] <bl4ckdu5t> you mean in the HTML? or programmatically in the javascript?

[07:31:34] <decx> na i'd rather have flaming skulls following the cursor
[07:31:45] <P0RK> er wait. Was that 1988?
[07:31:48] <P0RK> they all run together
[07:35:22] <bl4ckdu5t> oh I didn't see hat decx thanks
[07:36:00] <bl4ckdu5t> but the text is just dancing and it's black still
[07:36:18] <bl4ckdu5t> the point is the mouse hover makes it visible per character
[07:36:44] <P0RK> wow. Can't you figure it out from there? Seriously?

[08:28:24] <edoardo> hi
[08:29:05] <decx> html()==undefined is a strange way to go about that
[08:32:14] <BoomerET> Anyone here familiar w/ jqGrid, I'm using the in-line nav, and no matter what I change, it always uses POST, and I want to use GET, I've changed mtype in the editparms, to no avail.
[08:42:53] <BoomerET> Odd, the inline is correctly using GET, but the navGrid is using POST, what have I done <sigh>
[08:44:41] <BoomerET> Wait, do I need to set something in navGrid, I'm setting mtype in the inlineNav, must investigate
[08:45:00] <decx> this is now #rubberduck
[08:47:45] <BoomerET> <quack>
[09:05:28] <krambiorix> can i specify an order when selecting elements?
[09:12:51] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You'd have to sort them after you select them.
[09:12:59] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, ok thanks!
[09:13:09] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:15:37] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, any idea how to do that :D ?
[09:15:48] <decx> lol
[09:16:19] <BillCriswell> That smiley was great.
[09:16:49] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You can get an array of what jQuery selected with .get(), then you can use .sort() on them.
[09:19:01] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: What do you need to sort by?
[09:19:46] <decx> there you go http://jsfiddle.net/decx/4pyw2qxg/
[09:20:04] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, data-num
[09:21:40] <BillCriswell> What decx gave you should get you pretty close.
[09:22:12] <krambiorix> decx, thanks!
[12:01:46] <Hyperking> how would i check if an element has a sub menu?
[12:02:28] <Hyperking> checking if list element has a nested ul
[12:19:33] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: .children('ul').length should do it.
[12:20:13] <Hyperking> yeah,figured it out moments ago :-)
[12:29:37] <litropy> Hi, all - I'm using TouchSwipe, a plugin that senses swipe and returns values associated; can even return a value during the swipe live (fingers are now at X pixels from swipe origin). My problem is, I need to integrate scroll with this as well. My horizontal functions are complete, but vertically, I need to tell an overflow:hidden element to scroll vertically as the user swipes vertically. How do you think I should go about this? Offsetting top wo
[12:29:38] <litropy> uldn't do it, because the user won't always be swiping from my element.
[12:30:47] <litropy> sorry, i misspoke
[12:31:07] <litropy> The element is overflow-y scroll; overflow-x hidden.
[12:34:12] <litropy> The reason why I got into this mess is because I have an image slider nested into the scrollable element. So while it does what it's supposed to do - it slides images with swipe, when you try to scroll the element vertically, beginning your touch at the image slider, it doesn't know what to do. It's just kinda like, "Oh nice - that's a nice verrtical scrollevent. return;"

[15:02:10] <mork> BillCriswell: I have no 404 in network inspector
[15:02:34] <BillCriswell> What's the file name?
[15:02:57] <mork> and localhost is using linux, which is case sensitive. Thus, it should work on a windows/linux based server
[15:03:56] <mork> BillCriswell: I don't have any "Not found" in the network inspector. All seems to be loaded fine
[15:05:03] <BillCriswell> Did you just say the opposite though?
[15:05:27] <mork> Sorry, English isn't my mothertongue
[15:05:51] <mork> "I have NO 404" means for me "all fine"

[15:15:03] <mork> BillCriswell: "local" is only a url parameter to check type of video
[15:16:15] <decx> Grajope believe it or not you can use animate()

[15:20:54] <mork> Grajope_: sorry, I am not that good
[15:20:56] <decx> saw the fiddle?
[15:21:04] <Grajope> ok
[15:21:10] <Grajope> this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/os3wc58j/
[15:21:18] <decx> no this one http://jsfiddle.net/decx/0dbgeuzp/
[15:21:23] <Grajope> it's just that I was disconnected and dont know if anyone solved it
[15:21:40] <Grajope> oh cool
[15:22:23] <shoky_> mork: my guess is you're not supposed to be using this, and the author has taken steps to make it difficult for you to try
[15:23:06] <mork> It is not my intention to do any copyright infringement, I am just trying. The original page is here www.interactivepixel.net/vwall/index_default.html
[15:23:39] <mork> Before to buy on codecanyon, I am trying, since the author didn't answer.
[15:23:54] <shoky_> well he doesn't want you to ;)
[15:23:59] <shoky_> well
[15:23:59] <shoky_> he does
[15:24:01] <shoky_> on localhost.
[15:24:05] <Grajope> decx: i'm trying to understand it :P
[15:24:31] <aural> Is it possible to use jquery.ajax() success() method to return data to just outside of the scope (or just before) the call to jquery.ajax?
[15:25:04] <robertmaxrees> aural put all logic that depends on the ajax call to complete within the success/done callback.
[15:25:06] <aural> e.g. something like var myvar = $.ajax({....}, sucess: function() {return "success!";});
[15:25:27] <mork> shoky_: so functioning is deliberately blocked anywhere != 'localhost' || 'interactivepixel'
[15:25:46] <mork> shoky_: it is this that you are supposing?
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> if you really need to hoist that data up to the parent scope, decare a var there and set it within that callback - var myData; $.ajax().done(function(data) {myData = data});
[15:25:54] <shoky_> mork: something like that, yes
[15:26:25] <shoky_> mork: though the code tries to hide that fact
[15:26:47] <mork> shoky_: it seems to me that it is hiding very good
[15:26:49] <shoky_> calculates a hash of the url
[15:27:12] <shoky_> and compares it to stuff in an array they have: d = [1059, 653, 969, 1728, 1403]
[15:27:24] <aural> robertmaxrees: hmm, I notice that variables inside the ajax call do not have access to variables outside of the call.
[15:27:32] <robertmaxrees> aural yes they do.
[15:27:33] <shoky_> would be easy to disable this check... but also illegal/unethical prolly
[15:27:37] <robertmaxrees> aural that's how closures work.
[15:27:38] <mork> shoky_: that's good. it means that if I buy the code, it will probably work
[15:27:47] <robertmaxrees> any variable in a parent scope exists within all child scopes.
[15:27:49] <shoky_> mork: yup
[15:28:26] <mork> shoky_: thanks
[15:28:33] <Grajope> decx your fiddle is using the data-percentage value, but that's not the right one. I need to use data-value
[15:28:36] <shoky_> no probs mork
[15:28:54] <aural> robertmaxrees: I mean, variables inside the ajax call, are not accessible outside of it.
[15:29:02] <Grajope> ok nothing! fixed it!
[15:29:08] <robertmaxrees> aural which is why you need to do what I suggestred.
[15:29:29] <robertmaxrees> var myData; $.ajax().done(function(data) {myData = data});
[15:29:49] <aural> ah, makes sense
[15:30:58] <ytrezq> Hello, any ideas for this http://stackoverflow.com/q/25838472/2284570 ?
[15:31:10] <decx> so what is data percentage then?
[15:32:05] <robertmaxrees> aaand with that, i go prep for my gig tonight.
[15:32:06] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[15:32:30] <Grajope> decx: the bars height and the numbers% where in different data-* attributes. But it now works perfectly, thank you!
[15:32:57] <Woet> ytrezq: how about the answer that was given 6 days ago?
[15:33:06] <decx> you can do the bar animation in that step function too Grajope http://jsfiddle.net/decx/0dbgeuzp/3/
[15:33:17] <decx> less stuff to deal with
[15:33:20] <ytrezq> you've got the
[15:33:24] <aural> robertmaxrees: Right, however, myData does not preserve the value after the ajax call is finished.
[15:33:49] <ytrezq> Woet: you've got the answer (with the bounty)
[15:34:16] <Grajope> decx: yes i did :)
[15:34:42] <Grajope> also the '#bars' selector seems unnecessary
[15:35:05] <Grajope> thank you for the comments
[15:35:22] <decx> some context is always nice
[15:35:26] <Grajope> ^^
[15:35:48] <decx> same as $('#bars').find('.bar')
[15:37:04] <Grajope> that's right
[15:37:16] <Grajope> it was an automated phpstorm correction for my even poorer selection
[15:37:21] <Grajope> i'm learning on my feet
[15:37:36] <decx> a standing desk huh. well that's nice
[15:44:07] <mork> shoky_: you were right. There was a check on the url. Now I am less nervous about buying ;-)
[15:48:19] <jglover> this is probably not the right place to ask this question. but im looking for a simple filmstrip image gallery plugin. similar to this guy http://jsfiddle.net/benknowles/TUwqn/2/. I just don't want the preview though. I just need a gallery with the scroll functionality of the strip.
[15:49:15] <jphase> jglover: I believe that's called a "carousel" if I'm understanding you correctly
[15:49:24] <jphase> check out Owl Carousel or something similar
[15:50:18] <jglover> jphase: thanks man.  ican't believe i didn't know the name
[15:58:38] <aural> I have this javascript code: http://dpaste.com/2RBYDWR in which I am trying to access javascript variable classmates[i] inside of the ajax sucess function, where i is appropriately evaluated to the corresponding ajax call, however, I am not sure how to reliably/accurately pass the correct i value to the specific ajax call. Any ideas?
[16:24:09] <litropy> I have a function that tells how many pixels a swipe is from its origin in real time. I need to scroll my element, which is set to overflow-y:scroll, using the value from said function.
[16:25:35] <litropy> Something like function scrollit(pixels) { $("#myelement").scroll(pixels); }
[16:26:50] <litropy> Or ... I don't know ... function scrollit(pixels) { $("#myelement").css('top',pixels); } ... but the thing is, I still need the element to function normally. With an accurate scrollbar and the like.
[16:36:04] <ChairmanOfBoard> I'm looking for something to make a cool megamenu, any suggestions?
[16:39:10] <uskerine> hi, I have an input textbox that displays a modal when user clicks on it, is there any way to disable manual text input while still allowing user to click on it to display modal?
[16:43:13] <bjensen82> Im trying to use .on to trigger an event when my form looses focus. When I use focusout and go from one field to another in the form, then the event is triggered(!). How do I prevent that? So when a user clicks on each field in the form, nothing happens. When he clicks outside it -- the event occours
[16:45:32] <uskerine> bjensen82, I am not sure it there is a better way of doing it, but maybe this might help  $('#yourFormContainer').on( 'focusout', '#yourForm', function (e) {
[16:46:35] <bjensen82> uskerine: it still triggers. Even if I use tab to go from one field to another
[16:47:09] <uskerine> maybe  focusout is only triggered by input buttons and such stuff
[16:47:49] <uskerine> maybe you can check somthing like that:   currentElement=$(this).closest('form');
[16:48:04] <uskerine> and then see if the user has moved out from the form
[16:48:36] <uskerine> if not, your handler can just "return"
[16:49:55] <tw2113> gnarf, good talk at jQuery Conf
[16:54:58] <uskerine> bjensen82, you capture focusout for all form items and once in the handler, check if they belong to the form -which seems easy-, if not, then you have your "form" focusout, if they belong to the form, the user is still inside the form and you can just return. As far as I know you can not detect a focusout for a "form" as a whole.
[16:56:05] <bjensen82> uskerine: what do you mean by it seams easy? :-)
[17:01:52] <uskerine> hmmm no, it is not so easy now I think, as you need the destination object
[17:04:22] <uskerine> document.activeElement will give you the current active element (the one with the focus), once you have the element where the focusin it should be easy to detect if the user has moved out of the form
[17:08:18] <bjensen82> uskerine: yeah so if I click outside the form the focusout event doesnt get triggered
[17:08:50] <uskerine> really?
[17:10:06] <uskerine> I think that if handler is configured for a focusout event for the items within the form, and you click outside the form, the focusout event will be still triggered as the focus is leaving the form items
[17:11:33] <bjensen82> uskerine: sorry the focusout does get triggered. THe issue is when I click outside, I am missing an object to compare against, to check if its my form
[17:12:07] <uskerine> what does "this" return in the focusout event? the object that raised the focusout or the one with the focus?
[17:12:12] <uskerine> what about "document.activeElement" ?
[17:13:05] <bjensen82> this returns the elenet that raised the focus out
[17:13:13] <uskerine> and document.activeElement?
[17:14:02] <bjensen82> uskerine: heh, that just returns the body element
[17:14:34] <uskerine> that one should have the element with the focus
[17:16:19] <bjensen82> uskerine: it doesnt matter where I click, even if its another field it returns the body
[17:16:27] <uskerine> another option might be, focusin event for the elements within the form, and focusout event for the elements in the form, focusin event marks a global variable as "focus in the form" and "focusout" clears it out
[17:16:45] <uskerine> and during the focusout you can check if you were in the form
[17:17:25] <uskerine> forget it
[17:17:29] <bjensen82> yeah..
[17:17:30] <uskerine> still the same issue
[17:21:06] <uskerine> a global focusin event, you check if the global variable is marked and if this belong to the form. If it is marked and this belogns to the form return, if if it is marked and item does not belong to the form, you have your "form focusout"
[17:21:32] <uskerine> and in that last case you also clear the global variable
[17:22:17] <uskerine> so everytime an item gets the focus you check if that belongs to the form of not, and check a global flag.
[17:22:56] <bjensen82> well im using this as a autosave functionality. So when peopple click outside the form I want to send off ajax with the data
[17:23:16] <bjensen82> uskerine: im not sure your suggested approach would work with that..

[22:00:54] <scar> if i have an image, and in this case it's a solid color vector (turned into transparent image), how can i get a color overlay effect that just affects the non-transparent areas? i could create the hover state in white and keep the original black, and/or generate an SVG of each. but i want them to animate.
[23:15:57] <Mapper99> Anyone have some tips on how to style a jQuery AutoComplete input box?  My text flows off the end of the box - http://postimg.org/image/kxjrdyi6l/
[23:31:56] <litropy> Mapper99, $("#myautocompletediv").css({'width':$("#mysearchdiv).width,'overflow-x':'hidden'}); and you can offset the text if the rightmost part of your search options is the most pertinent.
[23:32:14] <litropy> Mapper99, or just make the text smaller.
[23:32:50] <litropy> You may have to fiddle with position:absolute or relative for various parts of that ... not sure.
