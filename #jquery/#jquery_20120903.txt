[00:03:58] <quiznilo> hello, is there any prohibition against having more than one $(document).ready(); functions?
[00:04:15] <quiznilo> I'm trying to sort out my templates
[00:04:41] <gianiaz> quiznilo, no
[00:04:49] <quiznilo> excellent, thanks
[00:04:59] <gianiaz> I often include different files with a document ready in each
[00:05:36] <quiznilo> yes, with my templates, I can now put the associated js in the same file as the html it affects
[00:13:55] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. I'm doing an AJAX search bar that suggests while you type.. The problem is that it searches a HUGE database, and even when I'm caching it, it doesn't work really well.. Because e.g. if I search on "lego", it begins to search with the L, and makes another search when I enter E (query = LE) etc... And it just jumps around and takes a few seconds before the final search result is shown (because it first shows the result for L, then LE, then LEG,
[00:13:55] <jaffipaffi> LEGO)... Any ideas on how I can prevent this?
[00:14:15] <jaffipaffi> I can't do it on blur, as the suggestions should fadeout then
[00:14:24] <juha_> jaffipaffi: use timeouts
[00:14:28] <jaffipaffi> I have thought about setting a timer onkeyup
[00:15:08] <juha_> jaffipaffi: also you could check the word length and only search when it's longer than x characters
[00:15:09] <jaffipaffi> juha_: That was kind of my thought... So onkeyup setting a timer on e.g. 2 seconds, and if the user hasn't entered something for 2 seconds, it'll begin to search
[00:15:10] <ajpiano> jaffipaffi: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[00:15:28] <juha_> jaffipaffi: well 2 seconds is way too long
[00:15:42] <juha_> jaffipaffi: i'm sure you'll find the perfect timing by trying
[00:16:31] <jaffipaffi> juha_: Yeah exactly.. But I'll try playing around with it then :)
[00:16:47] <gianiaz> jaffipaffi, 300ms for me is perfect
[00:17:12] <quiznilo> hmm
[00:17:41] <gloomer> jaffipaffi http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5073612/jquery-ui-autocomplete-combobox-very-slow-with-large-select-lists
[00:17:51] <gloomer> i have had luck with some of these solutions
[00:19:04] <juha_> i use timeout on my image search, can't remember what it is, something like 300 or less
[00:19:58] <jaffipaffi> ajpiano, juha_, gloomer, gianiaz: I'll try that debounce-plugin.. Seems really easy to implement
[00:24:09] <e66> how do I know the current jquery engine version?
[00:24:30] <e66> is there any property or method like $.version or $.getVersion() ?
[00:25:06] <ajpiano> $.fn.jquery
[00:25:24] <e66> Thanks
[00:26:44] <gianiaz> bye
[00:30:14] <oojacoboo> so, is $.parseJSON() really needed?
[00:30:40] <oojacoboo> or is that a browser specific thing?
[00:31:24] <oojacoboo> n.m.
[00:31:24] <systemfault> It's needed because crap browsers like IE7 don't have the JSON global object
[00:31:30] <oojacoboo> yea
[00:34:34] <mazzachre> I am making an input enhancement that does some decoration, what is the preferred way of doing this? Giving a class option that is added to the enhancement elements and add the styling in css or giving a css options?
[01:01:53] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/q3rcz/
[01:01:55] <oojacoboo> please explain
[01:02:47] <blackspotwiggins> oojacoboo, json is a string
[01:02:49] <blackspotwiggins> not an object
[01:03:11] <oojacoboo> blackspotwiggins, and parseJSON?
[01:03:22] <oojacoboo> I'm not following
[01:03:34] <blackspotwiggins> parsejson expects a string
[01:03:43] <blackspotwiggins> like the one you get with JSON.stringify()
[01:04:23] <oojacoboo> oh, so I guess I can safely skip parseJSON thenâ€¦. I didn't realize if I passed the headers of a file as application/json that I didn't have to parse it
[01:05:20] <blackspotwiggins> thats not what i said at all
[01:05:29] <oojacoboo> can you clear that up for me please
[01:06:00] <blackspotwiggins> i said: parsejson expects a string
[01:06:05] <blackspotwiggins> nothing more
[01:07:25] <izepstan> hi, hello there, is it possible to store a full html tree $('#content') with all children to sessionStorage and get it back from there with Query.jStorage.set
[01:09:22] <izepstan> get
[01:09:23] <izepstan> set
[01:12:56] <nveid> Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to pass a click to a lower layer if a click isn't register on a top layer
[01:13:29] <nveid> anyone have any tips?
[01:14:19] <nveid> i have an idea how I can detect clicks on the top layer or not.. though hwo to send the click to the lower layer.. i'm not so sure on
[01:14:36] <xec_> nveid: by "lower" layer, do you mean "parent"/"ancestor"?
[01:14:37] <diverdude> Hey, im using jcrop. I am trying to change the image of jcrop before i destroy it: http://jsfiddle.net/4zYgf/25/ but for some reason the image is not changed. If i only set the image and dont destroy jcrop (ie. comment out line: jcrop_api.destroy();) then the image changes just fine. How can i both change image AND destroy/disable jcrop?
[01:15:11] <nveid> xec_: I mean lower z-index
[01:15:43] <nveid> I have a top layer which works like a pull down panel, however part of this layer masks teh regular menu on the page
[01:16:15] <nveid> So.. When the person isn't clicking on the actual pull down button for the panel, i want them to still be  able to click on menu items
[01:16:24] <xec_> well, there are ways to "click through" elements, but it is not supported cross browser
[01:16:46] <nveid> The only way to click "click through elements" I found would block clicking on the top layer
[01:16:58] <xec_> right
[01:17:08] <xec_> nveid: but, the pull-down shouldn't be in the way when it's not opened?
[01:17:11] <nveid> that was a css thing though.. trying to find a jquery solution
[01:17:17] <xec_> nveid: do you have a live url?
[01:17:29] <nveid> no, working on it locally atm
[01:17:54] <nveid> the parts that mask it are part of the transparent menu
[01:18:01] <nveid> transprent image even
[01:19:14] <nveid> http://awesomescreenshot.com/03aew3i81
[01:19:28] <nveid> shold give you an idea
[01:19:46] <nveid> the grey part right there.. is a special pull down menu
[01:20:11] <nveid> however.. it hangs over the regular menu with a z-index.. So the div is masking the regular menu as well
[01:20:16] <xec_> nveid: the "profile" ?
[01:20:28] <nveid> yes.. Its blocking the profile & the logout button
[01:20:39] <nveid> the part whereyou see the red graphic
[01:20:44] <xec_> i don't see why it would
[01:20:46] <nveid> thast the pull down button for the menu
[01:20:58] <xec_> unless you have some 100% width transparent element
[01:21:05] <xec_> and if so, the question is, why do you :)
[01:22:03] <nveid> its not all transparent
[01:22:12] <nveid> look closely.. there is a silverish/whitish at the very top
[01:22:12] <xec_> i can't tell from a screenshot what's going on. if you want something specific you can try to reproduce in jsfiddle.net
[01:22:58] <nveid> k.. one moment
[01:28:21] <nveid> http://jsfiddle.net/M54K3/
[01:28:37] <nveid> you will see you can't click the "Click Me"
[01:29:35] <mazzachre> When I have an even.which How can I check against actual ascii? The old problem of adding a key validator to a textfield
[01:30:32] <xec_> nveid: http://jsfiddle.net/M54K3/1/
[01:30:46] <nveid> yes, now you can lower the panel
[01:30:48] <nveid> can't even
[01:31:07] <nveid> as it sends all clicks through the layer
[01:31:36] <xec_> oh actually, thats not the case, but i did forget to check the slidedown ^^
[01:31:43] <xec_> hold on
[01:33:01] <xec_> nveid: http://jsfiddle.net/M54K3/2/
[01:33:13] <xec_> my edits are in css only, i marked them with /* xec */
[01:33:44] <xec_> what i did was i made the containing elements as small as possible
[01:34:16] <xec_> as long as you don't have overflow: hidden; the descendants will still display outside bounds
[01:34:41] <sjeijk> good morning jquery
[01:34:53] <xec_> good morning sjeijk!
[01:35:12] <nveid> k.. going to examine whaty ou did
[01:35:31] <sjeijk> my first spaghetti Jquery code site is almost done :p
[01:35:42] <xec_> yay, I <3 spaghetti
[01:35:47] <xec_> with meatballs!
[01:36:04] <sjeijk> there s lots of meatballs in my spaghetti :D
[01:39:11] <mazzachre> Isn't it possible to find out what character a user is trying to put into a text field? I am currently listening to keydown and is working my way from the event, but I can't seem to find any help on converting the event data into the actual char that was input...
[01:40:47] <klj613> how can i do $('selector', container) type of selections with .on(..) ? $(container).on('click', '> tbody > tr'); doesnt seem to work with the first '>'
[01:41:17] <juha_> klj613: take the first > off ?
[01:41:26] <xec_> mazzachre: you use keycodes, available through event.which
[01:42:44] <gloomer> mazzachre http://jsfiddle.net/V4rTn/
[01:43:33] <mazzachre> gloomer: Well, that does what I have now... pressing "de)" logs "DE9" which was not what I was looking for...
[01:44:32] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/V4rTn/1/
[01:44:44] <xec_> mazzachre: rather than telling what you're not looking for, try telling us what you are looking for ;)
[01:45:20] <gloomer> mazzachre that one will work for "de)"
[01:46:04] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/V4rTn/2/ without extra bs
[01:46:05] <mazzachre> xec_: I thought I was... I am looking test check if the char the user tries to input into text field is in a set of "valid" chars (or matches a reg exp)
[01:47:01] <xec_> gloomer: doesn't do anything in Firefox
[01:47:05] <mazzachre> gloomer: Not for me... It does really strange things... Like outputting "%" when I press "arrow left" key
[01:47:37] <mazzachre> xec_: Try the arrow keys! :)
[01:47:43] <nveid> xec_: cool. I managed to keept he samething I was trying to accomplish with #panel height: 100%.. by just removing height completely and your mods still work :)
[01:48:03] <gloomer> chrome it works perfect for me
[01:48:04] <klj613> juha_, if i take the first > off. the selector wont be the same as $('> tbody > tr', container)
[01:48:07] <gloomer> arrow keys too
[01:48:22] <xec_> nveid: good :)
[01:48:31] <mazzachre> gloomer: Well, it is certainly not crossbrowser then :)
[01:48:32] <klj613> $('> tbody > tr', container) should be same as $(container).on('...', '> tbody > tr', ...)
[01:49:06] <xec_> mazzachre, gloomer; why don't you try e.which
[01:49:32] <nisseni> I'm using the datepicker for a field, now I also want to trigger a function on change on the very same field, this doesn't work when I have the datepicker applied to the field, how can I solve this?
[01:50:26] <mazzachre> xec_: Wow... the result is different between keydown and keypress!
[01:50:50] <xec_> yeah, it's a mess
[01:51:27] <gloomer> humm im really suprized its not working in ff
[01:51:55] <xec_> http://jsfiddle.net/V4rTn/3/
[01:51:58] <Krambiorix> hi guys, how can i replace a whole table row?
[01:52:02] <mazzachre> Hmmm... How do I do what I want then? Must I every time run through the entire value and validate each char? Or can I somehow do what I want?
[01:52:34] <xec_> mazzachre: i still don't know what you really want. validation? what sort of field is it? what are you validating?
[01:52:56] <coldhead> Krambiorix: $('tr').replaceWith('<tr><td>whatever</td></tr>')
[01:53:19] <Krambiorix> coldhead, thx!
[01:53:44] <mazzachre> xec_: I have a textfield, I want to validate for each keypress if the char the user presses is "valid" for my textfield (for the service) simply disallowing it with e.preventDefaults(); return false; from the event handler on keydown
[01:54:16] <gloomer> there are plenty of plugins for it
[01:54:23] <gloomer> or do e.which like xec_ says and use regex test
[01:55:47] <xec_> mazzachre: keypress + e.which + a simple test should do it, yes
[01:57:21] <xec_> http://jsfiddle.net/V4rTn/4/
[01:58:28] <mazzachre> xec_: Oh... I just tried that without any luck... Nice, this seems to do the trick...
[02:02:29] <decripter37> HELO
[02:02:46] <decripter37> how I can check if a $.post request take the correct path? :D
[02:03:03] <decripter37> (*have taken)
[02:03:13] <xec_> EHLO
[02:03:44] <gloomer> use fiddler
[02:03:58] <xec_> decripter37: i'm not sure what you mean by path in this case
[02:05:18] <decripter37> I have a request $.post('path_of_the_file', function(data){ ... })
[02:05:39] <decripter37> I want to check if path_of_the_file is correct
[02:05:57] <xec_> well, i assume you would get a 404 if it's not
[02:06:21] <decripter37> in my case I request a php page with a die(json_encode(data))
[02:07:13] <decripter37> so no 404
[02:07:38] <xec_> ok, so what does die() do
[02:07:47] <xec_> lunch, bbl
[02:08:01] <decripter37> nothing XD
[02:08:25] <decripter37> But the best is that neither javascript console gave me error
[02:14:16] <kadiks> decripter37: it's not because you're PHP does not return any data that the request is wrong. The $.post request will give an error if the page return a 404, 500, etc errors
[02:15:25] <decripter37> so what I can do, a page of test that require the entire file
[02:15:36] <decripter37> until I get correct page?
[02:17:52] <kadiks> sorry I don't have all info here. You want to do a request, but you don't have url ?
[02:18:25] <decripter37> yup, I want to know if the url I put is correct
[02:18:56] <Krambiorix> hi how can i get the index of a table row by id?
[02:19:34] <mazzachre> OK, what am I doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/V4rTn/5/ (My regexp knowledge is too basic) I just want to see if the input is a basic alphanumeric (a-z A-Z or 0-9)
[02:21:27] <Krambiorix> ow sorry, i have this: <tr><td><span id = "foo">bar</span></td></tr>  -> with foo as id i want to get the table row index... How can i do that?
[02:23:31] <tapia> Hi
[02:23:51] <tapia> I have a class, and I would like it to throw events
[02:24:00] <tapia> is it possible to do that with jquery=
[02:24:10] <tapia> ?
[02:24:37] <tapia> I've seen trigger(), but it seems to be only for DOM elements
[02:25:05] <kadiks> decripter37: is the link is going to change or are you going to try the same url until you get a response ?
[02:25:43] <mazzachre> tapia: Anything can trigger an event, and you can attach listeners to any even on anything... basically
[02:25:45] <decripter37> same url, I want an ajax request to get some html to append
[02:26:03] <xec_> mazzachre: [a-zA-Z0-9]
[02:26:06] <Krambiorix> anyone?
[02:26:36] <xec_> mazzachre: or just \w
[02:26:59] <kadiks> it is asynchronous so you will receive the answer in the "success" property of your call
[02:26:59] <tapia> mazzachre, if I try to do that with a custom class, I get "Object #<Object> has no method 'trigger'"
[02:27:35] <mazzachre> tapia $('.myclass').trigger('whatever');
[02:27:37] <xec_> mazzachre: then again, you'll also disable any keypresses like backspace, arrow keys etc
[02:27:44] <kadiks> $.ajax({url:'http://url.org', complete : function( a, b, c ){ if( a.statusText === 'OK' ) console.log( 'ok' ) }})
[02:27:52] <decripter37> I receive no response
[02:28:09] <kadiks> does your PHP return something ?
[02:28:13] <decripter37> I use $.post instead
[02:28:19] <mazzachre> xec_: Yes, I start by testing that e.which is below 20 AFAIK that is how it is done? (It was back in assembly days)
[02:28:19] <tapia> mazzachre, but $ is intended for DOM elements, isn't it?
[02:28:23] <decripter37> nope nothing
[02:28:39] <Krambiorix> i have this: <tr><td><span id = "foo">bar</span></td></tr>  -> with foo as id i want to get the table row index... How can i do that?
[02:28:39] <mazzachre> tapia: $ is jquery (unless you have changed something)
[02:28:49] <kadiks> so if you're PHP returns nothing how do you want that your Javascript returns something
[02:28:58] <kadiks> the actual request is good, the value is null
[02:28:59] <tapia> mazzachre, I guess I don't get it, sorry
[02:29:11] <decripter37> exactly I want to find a way to check if the url is correct
[02:29:16] <tapia> mazzachre, I have "MyClass.prototype = new Object ()"
[02:29:21] <decripter37> and after that use it
[02:29:25] <xec_> mazzachre: yes that would work
[02:29:34] <tapia> mazzachre, and in one of its methods, I want to throw an event
[02:29:46] <decripter37> is not my php that return nothing, actually return 'TEST'
[02:30:15] <tapia> mazzachre, MyClass.prototype.do_something = function () { this.trigger ('whatever'); }
[02:30:38] <mazzachre> tapia: Yuo have to attach events to the DOM in order to listen to them... Best solution is to attach the event to whatever element you are enhancing
[02:31:33] <mazzachre> xec_: It works... except for one small detail.. which seems to defeat what I have done so far :p Copy paste of invalid info works, because the check apparently does "v" :D
[02:32:06] <kadiks> $.ajax({url:'http://url.org', complete : function( a, b, c ){ if( typeof( c ) === 'undefined' ){ console.log( 'the PHP returned nothing' ) } }})
[02:32:12] <tapia> mazzachre, but the class doesn't have any DOM element attached to it, it's just business logic
[02:32:22] <xec_> mazzachre: hehe yeah. also it only accounts for english letters
[02:32:36] <decripter37> kadiks: I've done, thanks, I check my chrome request and find that url is not valid
[02:32:46] <decripter37> now, let's debug
[02:32:50] <mazzachre> tapia: Uhm... what is business logic doing in javascript?
[02:32:53] <decripter37> :D
[02:32:54] <kadiks> do you have a sample of code ?
[02:32:58] <kadiks> makes it easier
[02:33:20] <mazzachre> xec_: Ya, I know that, but that is fine... Hmm... I guess I just have to validate all input on each event... wonder how heavy that will be...
[02:33:27] <xec_> mazzachre: on keypress, you could strip the field for unwanted characters perhaps?
[02:33:34] <tapia> mazzachre, it's a model, not a view, if you prefer that term :-)
[02:33:37] <Krambiorix> i have this: <tr><td><span id = "foo">bar</span></td></tr>  -> with foo as id i want to get the table row index... How can i do that? I tried with $("#"+id).closest("tr").index() -> but this always returns -1
[02:34:13] <decripter37> I don't think that you can help me, I use zend with actions, so no really path, all guided by my router file ;)
[02:35:03] <Krambiorix> really, no one can help me???
[02:35:06] <mazzachre> tapia: Again, business logic exist serverside, not client side... Remember anyone can make changes to what runs serverside at runtime, invalidating anything you try to accomplish...
[02:36:25] <mazzachre> tapia: Anyway, code examples are better if you need some more advice...

[02:43:52] <nisseni> I'm using datepicker, and I can't seem to get the field to trigger on .change(), anyone knows how to handle this?
[02:44:53] <nisseni> it triggers on blur if I go back to the field and tab away...
[02:46:10] <decripter37> kadiks: Found the problem, my request return pragma: no-cache
[02:47:02] <decripter37> someone know how to disable pragma no-cache, I search online and saw that's my my ajax request is not attempted
[02:47:18] <decripter37> *that is why
[02:52:35] <mazzachre> Would this be a "livable" compromise? Or is it too slow? (Inputting non-std english characters, like Ã± or Ã´ etc) http://jsfiddle.net/T4pdZ/1/
[02:58:10] <djdolber1> hey there, a question, im making a page for ipad using jquery mobile, and i have a header div, content div and footer div based on the jquery mobile templates, how do i make the content div always fill out the remainder of the screen height ?
[03:08:32] <timing> djdolber1: I mostly don't fill the content div 100%. I just make the content div transparent and make sure the body has the background, so the content div looks stretched, but is not
[03:08:51] <djdolber1> timing:  smart
[03:09:01] <timing> but I don't know if that's possible in your design
[03:09:04] <djdolber1> but then you need to make sure the footer sticks to the bottom as well
[03:09:14] <timing> yes, that's true
[03:09:34] <djdolber1> im actually trying out this example now: http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/tags/jquery%20mobile
[03:09:38] <djdolber1> looks promising
[03:09:52] <timing> yes, with javascript everything is possible :-)
[03:11:19] <djdolber1> that example was kinda bad because it doesnt apply until after a transition, so i need to make it work before the transition
[03:13:56] <djdolber1> timing: Do you know a way to make this code intercept before the transition plays out ? $(window).bind("orientationchange resize pageshow", fixgeometry);
[03:15:34] <demetan> I use $.getJSON("process.php",{zoneID: idVal, ajax: "true"}, function(data){alert(data);}}); in firebug I have a response, but nothing in the alert
[03:15:37] <timing> djdolber1: I've never used jquery-mobile so I wouldn't kow
[03:15:59] <demetan> why ?
[03:16:22] <timing> demetan: what if you print it with console.log() instead of alert
[03:16:30] <djdolber1> im guessing this: 		    var header = $(".header:visible");
[03:16:30] <djdolber1> means that it only apply for visible objects with the header class right ? then if i remove :visible i should get all right ?
[03:16:48] <demetan> timing : I try
[03:17:03] <timing> djdolber1: yes it does, but I bet your header is visible anyway?
[03:17:14] <djdolber1> yey now it worked :)
[03:17:30] <djdolber1> yes, but all my other pages was not visible yet, so i needed them to be fixed as well
[03:17:37] <djdolber1> before i slide into them
[03:17:43] <djdolber1> with a transition
[03:19:19] <beepbeep_> Anyone know about some good tree plugins that are widely used? Found this using Google http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-plugins/treeTable/doc/
[03:19:42] <Andres75> Hello, I have tried mimicing this kind of scroll (http://www.k2.pl/#!/pl/strona-glowna/) for some time without any good results, could anyone be of any help? Thanks
[03:21:02] <demetan> timing : nothing in the console also, but response and HTML in firebug are populating
[03:24:11] <Andres75> this is what I have achieved up to now: http://www.psfinteractive.it/tiller/
[03:24:22] <Andres75> it lacks the "momentum"
[03:24:23] <timing> demetan: hmm no idea, maybe there is a global handler stopping the event?
[03:24:42] <timing> demetan: if you just say console.log('foo'); in the callback
[03:26:56] <demetan> nothing also, it s crazy i have the good callback datas in the response
[03:32:40] <Krambiorix> ok this is my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/Jz2BL/
[03:35:08] <mattyh88> hey, for some reason, i'm getting a "deleteChecked" is not defined. Why? http://jsfiddle.net/jRrxf/ I've cleaerly defined the function :)
[03:35:57] <xec_> Krambiorix: choose jquery from the framework dropdown on the left
[03:39:16] <Andres75> Krambiorix: what are you trying to get? the parent tr?
[03:39:41] <Krambiorix> Andres75, yes
[03:40:04] <xec_> it looks like it is working to me?
[03:40:18] <Andres75> confirm
[03:40:27] <Andres75> result is 1
[03:40:32] <Andres75> so it's the second tr
[03:40:39] <Krambiorix> it does work on the jsfiddle
[03:40:46] <Krambiorix> but not on my computer
[03:41:23] <Andres75> well how can we help with that
[03:42:16] <Krambiorix> i'm checking some stuff myself at the moment, thanks
[03:42:48] <xec_> Krambiorix: make sure your ID is unique, you can check with something like $('[id=test1]').length
[03:46:59] <Krambiorix> xec_ it says 0
[03:47:22] <xec_> Krambiorix: i assume you replaced "test1" with whatever your ID is?
[03:48:12] <Krambiorix> yes
[03:48:41] <xec_> so, 0 means it doesn't exist
[03:49:43] <Krambiorix> xec_ i do in fact: $("#"+u).length
[03:50:33] <xec_> that's not the code i gave you. that will always be 0 or 1. in any case, if you get 0 it means it does not exist
[03:51:05] <xec_> Krambiorix: the whole point with the attribute selector was to see if there was more than one element with the same id
[03:51:51] <Krambiorix> hm
[03:52:18] <Krambiorix> xec_ isn't ther another way to check?
[03:53:27] <xec_> why would you need another way to check something you already know -- the id you are looking for doesn't exist in the dom, maybe you're running the code early? maybe there's a typo?
[03:53:51] <xec_> Krambiorix: is the selector inside a doc ready?
[03:54:58] <Krambiorix> xec_ no
[03:55:53] <xec_> ok. maybe it should be? http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works#Launching_Code_on_Document_Ready
[03:56:48] <Krambiorix> xec_ the code is executed on a successful ajax call
[03:59:19] <xec_> Krambiorix: without seeing a live demo there is no way i can tell you why it's failing. if length is 0 it means the selector found nothing.
[03:59:56] <xec_> maybe you insert the element after you run the selector?
[04:01:01] <Krambiorix> nope
[04:07:59] <Krambiorix> xec_ could it be because of the id is an emailaddress?
[04:08:40] <xec_> it sure sounds like a bad idea, that's for sure
[04:26:49] <greek> Hi fellas. Is there any way for me to append to an item something that I've looked up via ajax() (kinda like .load()) ?
[04:27:25] <xec_> ?appendTo @ greek
[04:27:25] <bot-t> greek, .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[04:28:16] <xec_> or existingItem.append(newContent)  for the other way around
[04:28:36] <greek> I guess my question wasn't clear enough. I'm not looking for the default functionality of append / appendTo, because they require us to have the content that we wish to append already prepared
[04:29:07] <greek> Assume I still need to get the content via an ajax call before I can append it. Currently I am writing out a whole ajax call, and sticking the response inside of .append(response)
[04:29:25] <greek> I was wondering if there was a shortcut, similar to .load(), but for appending
[04:31:44] <galymzhan> Do custom events bubble just like normal events?
[04:32:08] <galymzhan> This callback doesn't work $('body').on('shown',  'a', function() { .. });
[04:32:33] <galymzhan> If I change event "shown" to "click" it works. "shown" is a custom event which gets triggered
[04:32:41] <Cork> galymzhan: depends on what version of jquery your using
[04:32:49] <Cork> if your using 1.7+ yes
[04:33:00] <galymzhan> 1.7.2
[04:33:40] <galymzhan> So it must work in 1.7.2, doesn't it?
[04:35:42] <Cork> galymzhan: http://jsfiddle.net/ByypW/
[04:43:34] <ansolas> us the a dbcklick event which i can use with on() ?
[04:43:44] <ansolas> or do i have to manually implement it
[04:44:27] <ansolas> or is theer a delegateable version of http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[04:44:29] <ansolas> available?
[04:46:14] <Cork> ansolas: dblclick is a normal dom element, nothing special about it
[04:46:26] <Cork> *dom event
[04:48:54] <ansolas> dbclick did not work with on()
[04:49:01] <ansolas> ahh
[04:49:02] <ansolas> ohh
[04:49:04] <ansolas> dbL
[04:49:37] * xec_ pours ansolas a nice cup of coffee
[04:49:46] <ansolas> awesome
[04:49:51] <ansolas> thank you
[04:49:57] <ansolas> thanks
[04:50:00] <ansolas> i need it :)
[04:50:29] <ansolas> whats the best approch ro make a text editabkle after double click ?
[04:51:08] <xec_> enable contenteditable probably
[04:52:25] <ansolas> ok that looks good
[04:52:28] <ansolas> thanks :)
[04:55:33] <ansolas> ok that woirks well but the whole test is selected after the dblclick :)
[04:55:54] <ansolas> selectabble=false would be helpful
[04:55:59] <ansolas> -b
[05:14:20] <Andres75> anyone can help me figure out what kind of scrolling formula is behind this site -> http://www.k2.pl ? Here is where I'm at : http://www.psfinteractive.it/tiller/
[05:14:32] <seutje> ansolas: if you're doing tabIndex heavy stuff note that focus might fire more than you expect it to in webkit browsers: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=91792 (should prolly re-create that issue as it still occurs, the test case still applies)
[05:14:46] <seutje> ...for contenteditable stuff
[05:15:18] <Andres75> if I use some easing and duration the scrollTo gets all messed up
[05:26:56] <gonssal> Andres75 you using scrollTo plugin?
[05:26:56] <ansolas> thanks for the hint
[05:27:09] <Andres75> gonssal: yes
[05:27:53] <Andres75> I'm using it mainly because they use it also, but it's not a restriction
[05:29:16] <gonssal> in your example i see it working
[05:29:45] <Andres75> yes it does
[05:29:55] <Andres75> but I need to make it fluid like theirs
[05:30:24] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone! may i ask some advice on a concept - if its possible?
[05:30:40] <jarr0dsz> i need to redirect a certain user in my webapp on time X, time Y and time Z
[05:30:57] <jarr0dsz> would it be possible to store times in JS inside the page... and when time.now = time x,y or z trigger an event?
[05:31:41] <radiodario> you could write a timer
[05:32:11] <gonssal> use the easing param
[05:32:16] <jarr0dsz> the problem i have now... my application depends on a background command recieved by websockets
[05:32:26] <jarr0dsz> it breaks if the browser reloads
[05:32:41] <jarr0dsz> so now my idea is to store those values inside the page and trigger them form the client instead, im already using a countdown jquery plugin (forgot the name )
[05:32:47] <jarr0dsz> wich counts down to a certain time
[05:33:06] <Andres75> gonssal: that won't work, I'll show you
[05:33:12] <jarr0dsz> i know these times, x,y,z they are solid, problem is the time.. how does one calculate if time X == time now
[05:33:18] <gonssal> Andres75 you need the easing plugin
[05:33:38] <Andres75> I already have it included, gimme a sec
[05:33:43] <jarr0dsz> since servertime and clienttime may differ, perhaps time_untill_x = 60.sec something like that
[05:35:18] <greek> Is there a best practise way to remove the row of the element I have clicked? (I'm clicking a "Remove" button inside a <tr>)
[05:35:33] <greek> I can think of a couple of ways (ie: .closest("tr"), .parent().parent(), etc.)
[05:35:46] <Andres75> gonssal: ok try it now -> http://www.psfinteractive.it/tiller/ it's VERY jerky!
[05:35:50] <radiodario> when you first load the page you could 'sync' servertime and clienttime by getting both and establishing a 'zeroing' zime
[05:36:08] <radiodario> i.e. if it's gmt and bst, servertime.getTime() - clienttime.getTime() would give you the time difference
[05:36:12] <radiodario> i.e. what zero is.
[05:36:26] <radiodario> then you just have to check for that difference to establish that they are the same time?
[05:36:29] <radiodario> i hate time operations
[05:37:49] <gonssal> use another easing?
[05:38:04] <Andres75> heh, no one works
[05:38:21] <Andres75> I tried most of them already
[05:38:30] <gonssal> you mean all do the same?
[05:38:51] <Andres75> they all have different curves, but they are all jercky
[05:38:55] <Andres75> *jerky
[05:39:02] <gonssal> maybe they wrote their own
[05:39:09] <gonssal> just browse their code
[05:39:21] <Andres75> they dont use easing
[05:39:48] <gonssal> then they are using either .animate or css transitions
[05:40:00] <Andres75> it's much more subtle than one would expect...
[05:40:07] <Andres75> no they are using scrollTo
[05:40:18] <Andres75> but the formula is different
[05:40:39] <Andres75> but it's with many variables, and it's very hard to decode
[05:42:42] <gonssal> well if you want the exact behaviour... you have to use theirs
[05:43:40] <Andres75> that's why I'm here, I can't decipher their code
[05:44:20] <gonssal> well i don't think anyone in here is doing that for you
[05:44:44] <Andres75> that's why I asked if there was a way to mimic it
[05:48:25] <johnmclear> Hey guys, I'm using jquery UI 1.8.9 and jquery 1.8 from google latest CDN.  In MacOS Google Chrome dragging an element returns a JS error of: Uncaught TypeError:..... has no method 'curCSS'
[05:48:28] <ansolas> what am i missing here ?
[05:48:28] <ansolas> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/KBj2h/
[05:48:42] <johnmclear> I have looked on the bugtracker and it's supposed to be fixed
[05:48:59] <johnmclear> I don't want to move away from using the Google latest CDN if possible because I'm a lazy admin :)
[05:58:09] <Abhishek_> hi
[05:59:01] <Abhishek_> which jquery function changes the css after clicking on some links ??
[05:59:23] <xec_> .click() and .css() !
[05:59:32] <Abhishek_> ya I know
[05:59:41] <Abhishek_> but there is a problem
[05:59:47] <xec_> problem?
[06:00:21] <Abhishek_> i want that when i click on some link css of a particular class change
[06:01:01] <Abhishek_> and it happens , but page refreshes and actual css files are reload
[06:01:17] <xec_> ?mdn preventDefault
[06:01:19] <blackspotwiggins> thats what links usually do
[06:01:20] <bot-t> xec_, Couldn't find "mdn preventDefault" in jQuery Docs.
[06:01:22] <xec_> doh
[06:01:33] <blackspotwiggins> better not use an url if you dont want to leave the page
[06:01:53] <xec_> Abhishek_: you can prevent the default behavior with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/event.preventDefault
[06:03:44] <Abhishek_> actually i want to implement a category menu like flipkart.com
[06:04:39] <Abhishek_> when i browse page i want my  menu with default css
[06:04:47] <ansolas> anyone: http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/KBj2h/2/
[06:04:48] <ansolas> ?
[06:05:10] <Abhishek_> after that i want when i click on any link , css of menu class changes
[06:05:42] <Abhishek_> and after that when i click on home page i want my meny with actual css
[06:05:54] <Abhishek_> how can we implement with jquery ??
[06:08:16] <aleminio> hey guys, is it possible to focus an editable span the way it works with a textarea\input?
[06:08:36] <aleminio> trying to use focus method but it doesn't do anything
[06:09:08] <Abhishek_> how can I implement a product category meny like amazon.com or flipkart.com with the help of jquery ??
[06:09:42] <xec_> ansolas: http://jsfiddle.net/KBj2h/4/
[06:09:48] <radiodario> Abhishek_: use a text editor to write the javascript code in jquery
[06:09:56] <radiodario> also read the jquery documentation
[06:10:08] <radiodario> docshttp://api.jquery.com/
[06:10:12] <radiodario> http://api.jquery.com/
[06:10:22] <Abhishek_> Ya , I know
[06:10:41] <radiodario> ok cool
[06:10:42] <Abhishek_> but i am facing a problem thats why i am asking
[06:10:46] <xec_> ansolas: in short,  jQuery data is not the same as html5 data attributes
[06:10:52] <radiodario> what's the problem exactly.
[06:11:24] <Abhishek_> my category menu displays after page loaded
[06:11:57] <radiodario> you could defer showing the page until the menu is loaded?
[06:12:02] <ansolas> @xec_: umm no the documentation says the following syntax: jQuery.data( element, key )
[06:12:07] <Abhishek_> i want when i click on any link except home css for menu class should be changed
[06:12:12] <ansolas> wheer do you found that syntax?
[06:12:17] <ansolas> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[06:12:27] <xec_> ansolas: there are two versions, $.data() is not $().data()
[06:12:28] <radiodario> Abhishek_: theres' a $(element).addClass()
[06:12:32] <xec_> ?data @ ansolas
[06:12:32] <bot-t> ansolas, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:12:46] <radiodario> ?addClass @ Abhishek_
[06:12:47] <bot-t> Abhishek_, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[06:12:51] <ansolas> jQuery.data( element, key )
[06:12:57] <ansolas> Description: Returns value at named data store for the element, as set by jQuery.data(element, name, value), or the full data store for the element.
[06:12:57] <radiodario> ?click @ Abhishek_
[06:12:58] <bot-t> Abhishek_, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[06:13:13] <xec_> ansolas: right. it will not fetch html5 data attributes
[06:13:28] <ansolas> yeah so why is my syntax wrong ?
[06:13:29] <xec_> ansolas: only things that are saved with .data()
[06:13:35] <ansolas> ahhh ok
[06:13:37] <Abhishek_> and i want when i click on home page my original css restored
[06:13:57] <ak> any tips for continuous integration in a js/php project?
[06:14:00] <Abhishek_> actually all are working
[06:14:08] <ansolas> ->>> there are two versions, $.data() is not $().data()
[06:14:12] <ansolas> new insight !
[06:14:14] <ansolas> THANK YOU
[06:14:19] <xec_> yeah, confusing i know ^^
[06:14:45] <Abhishek_> the problem is when i click on any link css of menu class changes for some time and page refreshes and original css restored
[06:15:10] <Abhishek_> i want my original css is restored when i click only on home page
[06:16:39] <Abhishek_> hi
[06:20:43] <ansolas> " i click only on home page" do you get back to the "homepage" with an ordinart http req or do you have a single page interface?
[06:21:18] <ansolas> if you just call teh hopmpage with an ordinary http req the default should be restores sice the page in new loaded
[06:21:40] <ansolas> other case you would have to store the initial css value somewhere (better solution?)
[06:28:29] <ansolas> lol
[06:28:45] <ansolas> its so entertaining how thing evolve

[07:42:55] <[knight01]> it does?!
[07:43:05] <[knight01]> is my browser fuhjuxed?
[07:43:09] <shoky> what browser?
[07:43:17] <[knight01]> ffox
[07:43:27] <[knight01]> v12
[07:43:51] <[knight01]> chrome says it just fine
[07:43:53] <[knight01]> so what's the deal FF?
[07:44:58] <shoky> [knight01] i think it's because margin & padding are actually just short names for margin-left/top/bottom/right same with padding
[07:45:14] <shoky> [knight01]: if you log  .css('margin-left') for example you'll get it in ffox too
[07:45:23] <[knight01]> good call bro
[07:49:46] <seutje> should try that with transforms, every browser returns their own flavour of it
[07:52:30] <rgr> whats th best approach to checkng if a parameter is a record or a number(or a string holding a number)? I could override he function I know, but well, I want to pass either a record or the primarykey of a record as the first param.
[08:02:01] <smart1> hey there, just a short question. f.e. i use ajasx to get an xml obj. i want to add the value of each title tag to my array. how can i get acces to the value of the tag? atm i just can add the object. but i want to add the string
[08:02:19] <smart1> how can i access the string
[08:04:07] <seutje> smart1: .text() ?
[08:04:08] <timing> smart1: by pulling her pants down
[08:05:07] <NodeX> anyone know if beforeunload fires even if they just close the browser ?
[08:05:58] <smart1> @seutje, thx i tried html, but got some errors when using with xml ^^ didnt see text in the api. @timing, **!xx@@** flame
[08:06:37] <timing> NodeX: yes
[08:06:46] <seutje> smart1: well, afaik, jQuery isn't exactly intended for working with straight XML, it has some massage-stuff in there, but I generally avoid XML like the pneumonic plague
[08:06:49] <timing> NodeX: I just tested it in jsfiddle (you could've done so too)
[08:08:08] <smart1> @seutje, got no chance to avoid xml. the whole system communicates with xml. but thx for the hints
[08:10:00] <smart1> @timing, when you got more answers like this, just leave so you can help people more than beeing here -.- @rest of the cannel thx and cya
[08:12:13] <eip56> Can anyone refer me to a site where I can review vanilla functions. I would go to W3C schools but their content isnt the most reliable.
[08:12:48] <cat_five> eip56: the mozilla developer network https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript
[08:13:01] <seutje> ?g mdn
[08:13:03] <bot-t> seutje, Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/
[08:13:28] <seutje> bot-t: EVEN THE CAT WAS FASTER!?
[08:13:28] <cat_five> can anyone help me figure out why .on() isn't picking up the most recently appended object?
[08:13:29] <bot-t> seutje, Signs point to yes.
[08:14:01] <seutje> cat_five: does your context change?
[08:14:04] <cat_five> looking at the markup, everything i have seems identical, but only the previously appended items are working
[08:14:23] <eip56> Thanks cat_five
[08:14:44] <seutje> cat_five: got example?
[08:14:53] <cat_five> yeah seutje i guess it does
[08:15:05] <cat_five> i suppose i could be listening on document everywhere
[08:15:18] <Deviad> Hello
[08:16:10] <NodeX> timing, thanks, I needed to know if an Ajax request could be fired
[08:16:16] <Deviad> Can anyone pls help me to understand why I even though I put return false;, this script keeps executing the form action? http://pastebin.com/73rEkfMq
[08:16:17] <NodeX> so I couldn't really test it ..
[08:16:22] <dabear> cat_five: did you actually use .on( events , selector, fn) or just .on(events, fn)
[08:16:23] <dabear> ?
[08:16:27] <NodeX> incase anyone cares, yes it can ;)
[08:17:24] <timing> NodeX:  I hope that's possible, let me know how it goes!
[08:17:32] <NodeX> [16:16:26] <NodeX> incase anyone cares, yes it can ;)
[08:17:37] <NodeX> "yes it can"
[08:17:58] <cat_five> dabear, seutje thanks for the tipâ€¦ i'm reworking it now so that all my on's are on $(document) to see if that helps
[08:18:24] <ansolas> here some doubleclick make editanble test : http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/HBYyF/11/
[08:18:25] <ansolas> :)
[08:18:34] <ansolas> focus shouldnt be an issue i hope
[08:18:51] <ansolas> focus is not suported by some browsers ?
[08:20:12] <dabear> ansolas: why would you use event delegation when you know that the target is a static div with a unique ID?
[08:20:16] <cat_five> hmm i don't think that helped...
[08:20:20] <Deviad> http://pastebin.com/pVuGnbW3
[08:20:23] <ansolas> just an example
[08:20:33] <Deviad> Can anyone pls help me to understand why I even though I put return false;, this script keeps executing the form action? http://pastebin.com/pVuGnbW3
[08:20:41] <dabear> ansolas: $("#userlist").on('dblclick',function(...
[08:20:42] <Deviad> My previous past got deleted for a mistake, sorry.
[08:20:46] <ansolas> no
[08:20:53] <ansolas> it is jusrt an non real workld example
[08:21:23] <ansolas> in reality i use the optimised , so dont worry about performance of a fiddle
[08:21:26] <ansolas> :)
[08:22:05] <dabear> still, using event delegation against a target with a static ID, strange
[08:22:20] <nFFF> Deviad, first thing, you do alot of appendTo's and accessing the dom, you can optimize this a lot
[08:23:00] <ansolas> no not strange :)
[08:23:23] <ansolas> you can initialize that handler even if userlist do NOT exist in the dom!
[08:23:53] <ansolas> thast teh purpose of delegating events no?
[08:24:12] <ansolas> try that with : $("#userlist").on('dblclick',function(...
[08:24:20] <ansolas> u will get an error sicnme userlist do not exists
[08:24:21] <Deviad> nFFF, I'm concert with the var bookingValidation part.
[08:24:26] <Deviad> concerned*
[08:24:31] <ansolas> brb
[08:24:36] <ansolas> smoke time
[08:26:54] <Deviad> In my other code where I used if () {} else {if () else {if() {} else {etc. etc.}} this part worked. Is it because I used "else if" improperly? But I don't think that's the problem.
[08:27:05] <cat_five> seutje: mind if i hit you with a decent-sized code dump?
[08:27:20] <seutje> paste?
[08:27:23] <seutje> ?paste
[08:27:24] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:28:10] <nFFF> Deviad, just saying your whole code is extremely unoptimized
[08:28:18] <nFFF> but that part one moment
[08:28:21] <cat_five> well yeah, i didn't mean in-chan ;)
[08:28:34] <seutje> cat_five: you never know, these days
[08:28:40] <nFFF> is the callback being fired? log something to console
[08:28:48] <cat_five> here it is sans markup for the moment
[08:28:48] <cat_five> http://jsfiddle.net/XH2mR/
[08:29:44] <Deviad> nFFF, how can I do that?
[08:30:13] <cat_five> everything works as expected, except the .playlist-item events don't fire on the most recently-appended element
[08:30:15] <Deviad> I'm using Aptana 3.
[08:30:21] <cat_five> but if you append another, the previous ones work?
[08:32:21] <cat_five> oh wait let me amend that
[08:32:49] <cat_five> the first one appended works, after that the most recently appended item breaksâ€¦ hmmm
[08:34:33] <_cb> am using jquery load to load an html file. Once that happens I loose the relative path to images. Any way to set a path?
[08:36:26] <seutje> cat_five: why are u returning something in the dragstart handler?
[08:36:54] <cat_five> seutje: it's a drag proxy element
[08:37:06] <cat_five> aka something that you drag while the original stays in the same place
[08:37:20] <seutje> oh, ok
[08:40:04] <cat_five> ugh this is frustrating
[08:40:15] <cat_five> even when i just append something manually in the console
[08:40:27] <cat_five> the the on() doesn't pick it up
[08:41:13] <seutje> cat_five: can't really see anything standing out, xcept some repeating stuff and it looks like that mousemove handler gets bound once for every time a video is dragged
[08:43:38] * cat_five cries
[08:43:50] <seutje> I don't see how that would cause the issue you're describing though
[08:47:51] <cat_five> omg
[08:47:55] <cat_five> it works in safari
[08:48:01] <cat_five> WHYYYYYYYYY
[08:48:54] <Deviad> nFFF, are you alive?
[08:59:14] <nFFF> Deviad_ what browser you are using?
[09:19:10] <xdjuj> hi
[09:19:25] <xdjuj> I can't remember how to "listen" to a function to finish
[09:19:39] <xdjuj> In order to do something else AFTER the succeed
[09:20:00] <xdjuj> something with on or like that
[09:27:53] <smart1> someone knows a good tutorial how to handle ajax in jquery? got the problem that my page is rendered before i get all data.
[09:28:50] <smart1> i write all data into an array, but it's empty all time. when i try to use a bitflag and while loop my website crashes / wunning to infinity.
[09:42:45] <smart1> noone got an idea?
[09:45:07] <konr_trab> How can I sanitize a string to be inserted in an html page to clear tags, scripts and problematic stuff?
[09:49:29] <filipiz> konr_trab: use .text() - http://api.jquery.com/text/
[09:50:08] <konr_trab> filipiz: thanks!
[09:51:57] <smart1> i saved some string into an array through ajax. how to find out when  ajax finished? while doesn't work or i'm using it a lil wrong
[10:05:49] <smart1> thx
[10:06:39] <smart1> so, now after Druide_ got kicked, i ask again ^^
[10:07:11] <smart1> how would you sync a job in jquery when u use ajax?
[10:09:42] <wilornel> Hey guys, what to do if a script tag is making some jquery-ui methods unavailable?
[10:10:27] <smart1> overwriting them again
[10:12:01] <wilornel> by making an additional jquery-ui script tag??
[10:14:59] <wilornel> Hey guys, what to do if a script tag is making some jquery-ui methods unavailable?
[10:16:57] <smart1> if this happens, i think jquery got loaded before your script get loaded. after this, your script is overloading the jquery functions. so the old ones doesn't exist anymore. reload jquery, and overload the methods again.
[10:18:29] <wilornel> so if <script src="google.com/jsapi" > is the problem, I have to re <script> all the files needed for jquery-ui after that google script and execute the methods?
[10:18:38] <lifechamp> any know of of a replacement for jsfiddle, jsbin, codepen.io etc that shows line numbers??
[10:18:48] <lifechamp> why don't those have line numbers? ugh
[10:19:01] <wilornel> gist.github.com
[10:19:05] <wilornel> ;)
[10:20:47] <Jadna> how can I get the name select and incremet?
[10:22:13] <smart1> @Jadna how do you mean this?=
[10:23:55] <smart1> @Jadna read through selectors http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[10:24:02] <Jadna> how can I get with jquery and select the name of the increment?
[10:24:09] <Jadna> understand now?
[10:24:40] <smart1> do you mean the parent?
[10:27:54] <Jadna> thank you @smart1
[10:28:20] <_cb> If I have <DOCTYPE on my html and load a div via $("#id").load(file) I loose any color information set via style=. Ie <b style='color:red'>test</b> displays test in black. If I remove the DOCTYPE it displays in red
[10:30:48] <smart1> sure you get the right doctype? it will work because the browser is in quirks mode if you got none.
[10:34:33] <smart1> @all i'm confused about callbacks and ajax
[10:34:59] <smart1> how do i "fire" an analyzation function after my ajax finished?
[10:49:03] <wilornel> smart1: $.ajax({ url: 'foo.com' }).done(function(){ console.log('success'); });
[10:57:16] <ElectricBoyfrien> How come the sourcecode not work??? jQuery('a').animate({easing: 'easeOutBounce', duration: 1500, step: function(now, fx) { console.log(now, fx); jQuery(this).css('moz-transform', 'scale('+now+')'); } });
[10:57:27] <ElectricBoyfrien> Step function not get called!
[10:58:06] <ajpiano> ElectricBoyfrien: what property are you trying to animate
[10:58:34] <ajpiano> i'm not entirely sure you'll be able to animate the transform property using jQuery
[10:58:41] <ElectricBoyfrien> ajpiano: -moz-transform: scale()
[10:58:41] <ajpiano> but it helps to specify *any property at all* to begin with :)
[10:58:52] <fkm> Why not use CSS transitions?
[10:58:55] <ajpiano> ^^
[10:58:56] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:59:05] <ElectricBoyfrien> fkm: Legacy browser support.
[10:59:11] <fkm> Yeah..
[10:59:17] <ajpiano> but you're using transforms....
[10:59:22] <fkm> As if moz-transform was legacy.
[10:59:33] <ElectricBoyfrien> And we don't know the equivalent CSS transition to get the easeOutBounce effect.
[10:59:52] <ElectricBoyfrien> ajpiano: We are also using zoom.
[11:00:08] <ajpiano> ElectricBoyfrien: i have to get up so i'm not sure
[11:00:19] <ElectricBoyfrien> You see, transforms are just being used for Firefox to get around its lack of zoom.
[11:00:47] <ajpiano> ElectricBoyfrien: anyway, like i said, you don't have *any* property specified in the animation params
[11:00:49] <fkm> ElectricBoyfrien: What about one of those: ease-in | ease-out | ease-in-out ?
[11:01:15] <fkm> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/
[11:01:38] <fkm> But yes. There's no bouncing :-D
[11:02:20] <ElectricBoyfrien> ajpiano: Hmm, how do I add one? :-S
[11:02:52] <ElectricBoyfrien> I tried: jQuery('a').animate({mozTransform: 'easeOutBounce', easing: 'easeOutBounce', duration: 1500, step: function(now, fx) { jQuery(this).css('-moz-transform', 'scale('+now+')'); } });
[11:03:44] <ajpiano> try "-moz-transform"
[11:04:30] <ajpiano> and try it on the most recent version of jQuery
[11:04:46] <ajpiano> jquery 1.8 supports auto expansion of vendor prefixed properties
[11:04:51] <ajpiano> so you could try just "transform"
[11:05:36] <ajpiano> though i'm not 100% sure it'll work with transform
[11:05:47] <ajpiano> if you have more trouble, i'd bounce the question off gnarf when he's around
[11:06:17] <ajpiano> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/09/jquery-1-8-released/
[11:06:54] <ElectricBoyfrien> Yeah, I am using the latest jQuery.
[11:07:01] <ElectricBoyfrien> ajpiano: Okay.
[11:07:14] <ElectricBoyfrien> My step function is definitely not getting called: jQuery('a').animate({'-moz-transform': 'easeOutBounce', easing: 'easeOutBounce', duration: 1500, step: function(now, fx) { console.log(now, fx); jQuery(this).css('-moz-transform', 'scale('+now+')'); } });
[11:07:42] <wilornel> guys, what does it mean when I try to include a .js file into my website but it says: uncaught syntaxError: Unexpected Identifier?
[11:09:00] <ElectricBoyfrien> wilornel: The JavaScript tokenizer encountered an improper char.
[11:09:26] <wilornel> I am pretty sure its clean
[11:10:22] <wilornel> can it be linked with the fact that my jquery-ui functions all have: #Object has no method .slider(); ?
[11:10:53] <ElectricBoyfrien> wilornel: You could be missing a comma between two arguments to a function.
[11:11:13] <wilornel> thats not it
[11:11:19] <ElectricBoyfrien> wilornel: Potentially.
[11:11:59] <ElectricBoyfrien> wilornel: Those errors may have occurred because the slider function has the syntax error. Can you get a line number?
[11:12:15] <wilornel> one sec
[11:13:47] <wilornel> well
[11:14:22] <wilornel> for jquery-ui-1.8.23.custom.min.js, its on line 1.... if I check on google chrome it says: invalid category, need to redirect 1222<pre class='xdebug-var-dump' dir='ltr'><small>string</small> <font color='#cc0000'>'so im here, invalid category'</font> <i>(length=28)</i>
[11:15:05] * ElectricBoyfrien is confused.
[11:15:11] <wilornel> I also am..
[11:15:12] <ElectricBoyfrien> Oh wait.
[11:15:48] <ElectricBoyfrien> class='xdebug-var-dump' dir='ltr'><small>string</small> <font color='#cc0000'>' <-- Those inner quotes should be escaped
[11:15:56] <wilornel> I see
[11:15:57] <ElectricBoyfrien> Or replace them with " quotes
[11:16:10] <wilornel> Alright, thanks, I have to go now
[11:38:06] <ScottG> Is there a way to set priority of events? I want a click event to fire before a focus out.
[11:39:29] <ScottG> Well more broadly, I don't want this focus out event to fire when I click on certain other things.
[11:40:16] <alexr2> ScottG, I had the same problem in something I've done.  I didn't really look into it and kinda patched it (probably not the best way, but it worked).  I just set a 50ms timeout on the blur event
[11:40:45] <alexr2> That way the click event was handled first
[11:41:12] <wilornel> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[11:42:52] <ScottG> wilornel: Well the other things I'm clicking on aren't necessarily parents of the thing I have the focusout bound to.
[11:55:50] <BabySuperman> I have an accordion, I am setting .accordion display: none, but when I try to do $('.accordion').show() it's not behaving properly, the accordion wont expand any more =\
[11:56:28] <BabySuperman> When I don't start the page with .accordion display:none; it works fine, but i want it to be invisible until the user expands a div
[11:57:38] <filipiz> BabySuperman: .accordion() needs to be visible when it is initiated.. to calculate heights and other proporties that are only available on DOM when the elements are visible
[11:57:57] <BabySuperman> filipiz, i figured it was something like that -- how can I solve my problem here?!
[11:58:34] <filipiz> you should only call .accordion() initialization after you show the elements..
[11:58:46] <BabySuperman> I'm using bootstrap, it is automatically calling it
[11:58:58] <filipiz> mayby you load the page with the display:none on those elements..
[11:59:05] <filipiz> then you call .show()
[11:59:19] <filipiz> and only after the show() you initiation the .accordion())
[11:59:28] <BabySuperman> I am already doing that I thought... but it's not working... because its trying ot init when it cant see it
[11:59:49] <BabySuperman> bootstrap is automatically creating the accordion
[11:59:51] <alexr2> BabySuperman, the way things are opened/closed in bootstrap accordion are through the "on" class.  Check out the documentation for it
[12:00:01] <BabySuperman> alex1, tyVM!
[12:00:05] <BabySuperman> alexr2*
[12:00:47] <alexr2> Make sure you are following the correct format for bootstrap for accordions, a lot of it's stuff you can jerryrig it to work not quite how it was meant to, but accordions need to be spot on from my experience
[12:01:00] <BabySuperman> i think i got it, just this display non enot working
[12:01:14] <chad_c> anyone out there using history.js?  I'm looking for some tips on best practices for single page apps.  I'm loading content using .load() but I'm not able to get direct URLs to work properly.
[12:01:17] <Fleep> Hey guys. If I already have two matched sets, is there a way to combine them (I'd like to use them both w/ a promise object)
[12:01:26] <alexr2> Show some code?  jsfiddle.net
[12:06:26] <chad_c> alexr2: it's kinda hard to show code for this since it could be an .htaccess issue
[12:06:34] <chad_c> alexr2: what can I show?
[12:06:47] <alexr2> sorry chad, that was mean for BabySuperman
[12:07:19] <chad_c> alexr2: ah, okay, no worries
[12:07:30] <alexr2> chad_c, you're using a framework i'm assuming?
[12:07:43] <chad_c> yeah I'm using jquery, but that's it
[12:07:48] <alexr2> nono, backend i mean
[12:07:56] <alexr2> what language are you using?
[12:08:25] <chad_c> chad_c: no backend framework, just a couple of static .html files that I'm loading into a div.  It's not large enough to need a backend framework, so I'm having issues finding the best way to do this.
[12:08:35] <alexr2> hmm
[12:08:46] <chad_c> alexr2: one index page, load separate .html files into a div based on the navigation menu
[12:09:00] <chad_c> works great if you don't use back/forward buttons
[12:09:23] <chad_c> so I'm not sure if I need a listener to go along with history.js
[12:09:54] <Fleep> http://jsfiddle.net/HJ98C/2/
[12:10:03] <Fleep> Is there a way to combine $foo and $bar into $fade_both
[12:10:29] <alexr2> chad_c, you can look into html5 history stuff
[12:10:33] <alexr2> that way forward/back buttons work
[12:10:45] <Fleep> AS in, what's the preferred way to combine collections
[12:10:47] <alexr2> http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html
[12:10:54] <chad_c> the events fire properly, but what doesn't work is if I type http://mysite.com/nav1
[12:11:10] <Fleep> Nm, I think I just found it
[12:11:12] <chad_c> that should load nav1 content into my index page
[12:11:19] <alexr2> chad_c, without a backend framework, you'd need to look into window.location and parse the location
[12:11:31] <chad_c> alexr2: thanks, I'll start there
[12:12:53] <Fleep> Solution: http://jsfiddle.net/HJ98C/3/
[12:12:56] <Fleep> (The add() method)
[12:13:53] <alexr2> Fleep, you're doing extra, this works fine: Â  Â  Â  Â Â $fade_bothÂ =Â $foo.add($bar);Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
[12:14:15] <Fleep> Wont' $foo.add($bar) modify $foo?
[12:15:12] <Fleep> Oh ,it won't. Thanks
[12:15:42] <alexr2> no problem
[12:19:21] <artichoke> I'm trying to get a list of elements i.e. var arrayOfStuff = $('div#stuff') and then modify the item's attributes using arrayOfStuff[index].attr('id', 'value') but it looks like I'm missing something... any clues?
[12:19:54] <alexr2> artichoke, gotta do a jquery.each loop
[12:20:27] <artichoke> alexr2: Thanks I'll look into that

[12:21:27] <artichoke> thank you!
[12:21:50] <alexr2> No problem
[12:27:10] <hateIE> hm
[12:27:33] <hateIE> do header elements obey text-align ?
[12:30:38] <BabySuperman> alexr2 i think i got it, ty though, I'll try this "on" thing :)
[12:30:49] <alexr2> Okay
[12:31:08] <BabySuperman> im having trouble finding documentation googling "bootstrap on off toggle etc"
[12:31:25] <majd_> Hey #jquery - i have a text input that i want to be always filled with a text. Whatever the user types, the text should be appended to that field. What's the best way to go about implementing that?
[12:32:06] <majd_> Maybe a function that is triggered on key press and adds the missing characters if they don't already exist?
[12:32:23] <majd_> are there better ways to implement this kind of functionality?
[12:36:29] <BabySuperman> alexr2, can you help me find the documentation on that please?  I can't seem to find any...
[12:36:53] <alexr2> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#collapse
[12:38:15] <alexr2> sorry... it's "in"
[12:38:18] <alexr2> not "on"
[12:38:34] <BabySuperman> alexr2, alright im confused, i'll keep reading and smashing my head against the wall :D
[12:39:44] <BabySuperman> alexr2, and this seems like it's already what im doing.  I have accordions working fine,I just want them completely hiddne until the div is expanded hrmmmmm
[12:42:26] <alexr2> BabySuperman, http://jsfiddle.net/RVFM9/1/
[12:42:56] <BabySuperman> here let me modify this a tit
[12:43:00] <alexr2> If you're using the right format, just don't put that "in" class anywhere, and they'll all be closed
[12:43:26] <alexr2> majd_, sounds like you're building a keylogger :-P
[12:43:33] <BabySuperman> http://jsfiddle.net/RVFM9/2/
[12:43:39] <BabySuperman> alexr2, that's not what I want though :)
[12:43:46] <BabySuperman> That's what I want, it's invisible, then make it show/work again
[12:45:14] <jarred> Can I insert a DOM element by XPath with jQuery?
[12:45:15] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net/RVFM9/4/
[12:45:47] <BabySuperman> you done did it !

[12:52:57] <BabySuperman> works now
[12:52:59] <BabySuperman> sorry to bother
[12:53:04] <alexr2> no worries
[12:53:06] <alexr2> glad I could help

[13:04:18] <Jadna> I have a select and want a textarea appear when certain options are selected, whit Jquery
[13:06:46] <alexr2> Bind a click event to your options
[13:13:20] <Jadna> help me please!!!
[13:13:36] <Jadna> I have a select and want a textarea appear when certain options are selected, with Jquery
[13:14:37] <alexr2> (04:06:45 PM) alexr2: Bind a click event to your options
[13:14:55] <alexr2> ?on @ Jadna
[13:14:56] <bot-t> Jadna, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:25:54] <Jadna> @+bot-t thank you!
[13:30:49] <Jadna> if($("#" + $(elemento).attr('id') + " option:selected").text() == 'select')    ---> what wrong?
[13:32:08] <astropirate> Jadna, i'm not feeling well today. i'm a male  human  living on earth. what is wrong with me
[13:32:32] <bindi> astropirate: i google-diagnosed you and it most definitely is cancer
[13:32:41] <astropirate> :O  ohh dear
[13:34:09] <Jadna> astropirate I don't know your problem, cause I'm not a doctor
[13:34:31] <astropirate> Jadna, so you aren't omnipotent?
[13:36:59] <alexr2> Jadna, why don't you do $("#" + $(elemento).attr('id') + " option:selected").text()  and see what it returns?
[13:37:09] <alexr2> also, you should take a look at ? find
[13:37:18] <alexr2> ?find @ Jadna
[13:37:19] <bot-t> Jadna, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[13:45:21] <LifeSF> hi i wanted to know if there is a way to use jquery properly so it stop cranking up in ram usage
[13:47:12] <Jadna> thank you guys
[13:47:18] <Jadna> I fix it
[13:47:32] <alexr2> LifeSF, what do you mean it cranks up ram usage?
[13:47:41] <alexr2> Are you sure you aren't doing something in your code that causes it?
[13:48:09] <LifeSF> i don't know i found ths code it works great but problem is it just uses so much ram more and more it just keeps using more and more ram it's insane
[13:49:06] <alexr2> Not jquery that's causing the ram increase then, it's the plugin you're using
[13:49:23] <alexr2> Probably have some sort of loop in the code
[13:49:28] <alexr2> that isnt' done well
[13:52:18] <LifeSF> http://jsfiddle.net/Y27ab/
[13:57:35] <alexr2> can't include script that way, you need to add a direct link in the add resources tab
[13:57:44] <alexr2> and select jquery if you want to show it
[13:58:10] <alexr2> And yes, setinterval is not the best way to do loops
[13:58:22] <alexr2> I recommend against it
[13:58:24] <alexr2> use setTimeout
[13:59:30] <LifeSF> lost, i'm'trying to learn and understand jquery and all but i have no clue what's going on in there :S
[13:59:50] <alexr2> haha okay, let me try to explain then
[14:00:26] <alexr2> You're running a function as soon as it loads
[14:00:36] <alexr2> $('.icon') grabs all elements that have a class icon
[14:00:41] <alexr2> [0] will select the first one of those
[14:00:45] <LifeSF> $(function() { yeah
[14:01:13] <LifeSF> ok
[14:01:20] <alexr2> so you're just setting a variabel bpy to -50 there
[14:01:23] <alexr2> for the first element
[14:01:39] <alexr2> setInterval shouldn't be used because it does not offer as much control as settimeout
[14:01:47] <alexr2> ignoring that fact though...
[14:02:10] <alexr2> going to the each function
[14:02:21] <alexr2> select all elements with class wave, and iterate through them
[14:02:35] <alexr2> you're updating the background position style for each one of them
[14:02:55] <alexr2> that update is on an interval
[14:03:04] <LifeSF> yeah
[14:03:12] <LifeSF> so it updates the color change
[14:03:25] <alexr2> and it's done on a 10 ms loop, which is quite quickly
[14:04:41] <alexr2> changecolor is run once
[14:04:55] <alexr2> on all elements with icon class
[14:05:05] <alexr2> animate, you can read up on here:
[14:05:09] <alexr2> ?animate @ LifeSF
[14:05:09] <bot-t> LifeSF, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:05:42] <LifeSF> here you'll see the outcome http://moncoiffeur.ca/index_frames.php
[14:06:01] <starsinmypockets> Anyone mind looking at this... not sure why it won't run http://jsfiddle.net/CEQdn/
[14:08:10] <alexr2> LifeSF, my memory footprint isn't increasing?
[14:08:43] <starsinmypockets> That code actually works in my dev environment, but I'm having a trouble with the inner uls bouncing up and down... not sure why jsfiddle won't call hover()
[14:10:03] <alexr2> starsinmypockets, it does call hover
[14:10:08] <alexr2> it's working correctly the way you wrote it
[14:10:21] <alexr2> your inner uls, aren't actually inner uls
[14:10:24] <LifeSF> everytime i've checked in the pas weeks it's been cranking up... i don't get it
[14:10:24] <alexr2> they're outside of the lis
[14:11:36] <starsinmypockets> alexr2 - i see - thanx
[14:15:04] <LifeSF> yeah it still goes up! i see it go up approximately around 150-300kbps up in ram usage
[14:15:10] <starsinmypockets> So, assuming this is how it's 'supposed' to work, can anyone offer some advice how to make this actually work smoothly? http://jsfiddle.net/ctEyq/
[14:15:45] <alexr2> starsinmypockets, smoothly as in?
[14:17:04] <alexr2> LIfeSF, are you sure it's that piece of code and not something else?
[14:17:11] <alexr2> Comment out sections of code and narrow it down
[14:17:47] <LifeSF> well if i stay on google .com nothing happens
[14:18:58] <alexr2> LifeSF, narrow it down to what is causing the issue.  Comment out sections of code until you find the piece that's causing the actual increase
[14:19:13] <starsinmypockets> alexr - I think that I maybe I need to set a timeout on the moueIn so that it doesn't bounce so erratically. I'm also looking at hoverIntent... which I think might smooth it out. But I'm just after someone more experienced who could point me in the right direction..
[14:19:15] <pajo> why won't my accordion work after removeing accordion content and then reinitializing the content after i have created them again - it creates new classes to the container but the children wont get any styles to them -> http://pastebin.com/eDcwg9UY
[14:20:01] <starsinmypockets> alexr2^
[14:21:23] <alexr2> well, the bouncing is happening because events get queued up and are launched one after the other
[14:21:42] <alexr2> look into stopping animation and then clearing the queue
[14:24:47] <starsinmypockets> alexr2 roger that - tx
[14:25:11] <starsinmypockets> alexr2 are you familiar with hoverIntent pluging? Perhaps that addresses the queue issue also?
[14:26:06] <alexr2> i've seen it before
[14:26:08] <alexr2> never used it though
[14:26:13] <alexr2> feel free to try it out

[16:02:56] <Eviltwin> One of those is probably what you're looking for
[16:03:00] <Eviltwin> They do slightly different things
[16:03:16] <oojacoboo> yes, :eq() thanks
[16:04:15] <Eviltwin> But "ul li(0)" doesn't mean anything
[16:05:01] <oojacoboo> "ul li:eq(0)" does though, no?
[16:05:37] <jm|laptop> hello :)
[16:06:18] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Yes
[16:06:52] <Eviltwin> But for example I could write $("ul <<*< li") <--- How do I do this?

[16:45:26] <kkuno> the problem is that the text should have other tags inside it

[19:13:50] <forti2ude> basically what i am seeing is the 1st entry repeating twice
[19:14:04] <forti2ude> before moving on to the next item
[19:14:30] <tw2113> you'll need to define your userEntries variable first
[19:16:22] <forti2ude> tw - when i look at the net tab in firefox
[19:16:26] <forti2ude> i see
[19:16:34] <forti2ude> var userEntries={"entries":[{"â€¦â€¦
[19:16:37] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/KC7tr/1/
[19:16:40] <forti2ude> json data
[19:16:43] <coldhead> you're appending inside the loop
[19:16:44] <coldhead> every time
[19:16:49] <coldhead> as well as += the string
[19:16:54] <coldhead> move the append outside the loop
[19:16:57] <coldhead> just do it at the end
[19:16:58] <coldhead> and voila
[19:17:06] <coldhead> la dolce vita
[19:17:08] <forti2ude> hmm let me try
[19:17:40] <coldhead> hey shoky
[19:18:09] <forti2ude> booyah!!
[19:18:19] <forti2ude> thx t-dub and coldhead
[19:18:26] <zedro> hey everyone
[19:19:28] <coldhead> hi zedro
[19:20:49] <zedro> anyone free to help me figure out an ajax failure issue with jquery 1.8?
[19:21:11] <tw2113> everyone's free?.to wear sunscreen
[19:22:20] <zedro> definitely, it's a fundamental right
[19:23:08] <coldhead> goodnight cognominal_'s gombuter
[19:23:25] <forti2ude> cya, thx again
[19:23:43] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your life, forti2ude
[19:23:55] <forti2ude> you too
[19:26:42] <coldhead> forti2ude: i will never forget you
[19:29:28] <lolfrenz> can I somehow force a refresh on all the children of a div once addClass has been performed?
[19:29:46] <lolfrenz> because addClass changes the style of the current container, but not its children
[19:30:02] <coldhead> that is not so, lolfrenz
[19:30:22] <lolfrenz> hmm, I'll double-check
[19:30:26] <lolfrenz> bbl
[19:30:30] <tw2113> what would change in the kids?
[19:30:33] <coldhead> if you have body.foo a {color: #0f0} that will change the a colour as soon as you addclass foo to body
[19:31:28] <lolfrenz> coldhead, thanks, the problem must be elsewhere.
[19:31:34] <jamesaa> any idea why things after a .load() won't load in  jQuery
[19:32:04] <coldhead> need to see the code, jamesaa
[19:32:56] <jamesaa> coldhead, http://pastie.org/4659773
[19:34:19] <tw2113> lolfrenz, what would change on the kids?
[19:34:24] <coldhead> zedro: ask your actual question and people will answer if they can
[19:34:53] <coldhead> jamesaa: the problem is that .load() is asynchronous
[19:35:00] <coldhead> so it runs in the background and takes its time
[19:35:01] <zedro> coldhead: thanks
[19:35:07] <coldhead> whereas you are calling masonry right away
[19:35:11] <coldhead> before load has finihsed
[19:35:19] <coldhead> you need to call masonry in some kind of success callback
[19:35:24] <zedro> I'm making an ajax call for a resource and getting a status code of 200 back, but the fail callback is being called
[19:35:24] <coldhead> which i assume load provides
[19:35:37] <jamesaa> coldhead, how can I fix it?
[19:35:42] <coldhead> indeed it does http://api.jquery.com/load/
[19:36:12] <coldhead> something like this, jamesaa http://pastie.org/4659792
[19:36:32] <coldhead> zedro: what are you expecting back? html or json or plain text or what?
[19:36:46] <zedro> html
[19:36:48] <coldhead> sometimes you need to tell jQuery what to expect via dataType: 'json' or whatever
[19:36:52] <jamesaa> coldhead, that makes sense thanks
[19:36:52] <coldhead> hmm
[19:36:58] <coldhead> may we see the code, zedro ?
[19:37:09] <coldhead> can you put it on jsfiddle or something?
[19:38:07] <zedro> Yep, I'm putting up the code now
[19:38:42] <coldhead> looking forward to it
[19:40:34] <zedro> http://jsfiddle.net/marothstein/JzKTc/
[19:40:49] <zedro> that is just the request segment
[19:41:49] <zedro> compiled from coffee, so please disregard the return statementsâ€¦. not my doing
[19:42:25] <coldhead> why don't you try dataType: 'html'
[19:43:37] <zedro> that'll do it!
[19:43:57] <zedro> thanks for the assistance!
[19:44:55] <coldhead> have fun with your coffeescripting, zedro
[19:45:33] <zedro> and you with your activities, coldhead
[19:46:45] <coldhead> lol my activities
[19:47:00] <coldhead> its like he knows i am a porn trader
[19:47:25] <tw2113> and that's just as a coverup to me
[19:48:49] <coldhead> we all know my activites are of no consequence
[19:48:56] <coldhead> and all models are 18 or over
[20:10:53] <bookbay> I've been checking out slabtext.js - http://www.frequency-decoder.com/demo/slabText/ - anyone else recommend any typography or interesting display plugins they've found useful?
[20:35:38] <ibodi> is there a str.charCodeAt(0) in js that return same value as php::ord() when str==multi-byte unicode?
[20:37:40] <ibodi> eg. i had 'ä¸­'.charCodeAt(0) return 20013 while php::ord('ä¸­') return 228
[20:42:13] <gt3> how come if i do  x.id='#foo'; if ($('#foo').length)) works fine but if I assign '#foo' to a string it doesn't: id='#foo'; if ($(id).length) ?
[20:42:47] <gt3> makes no sense why it wouldn't work
[20:42:59] <arielserafini> x.id='foo'
[20:43:18] <arielserafini> don't use the #
[20:43:18] <gt3> oh god, you're right, duh
[20:43:32] <gt3> this is what happens when i mix vanilla js with jquery :p thanks
[20:43:38] <arielserafini> :)
[20:52:33] <Guddu> Is there a wy to remove redundant(unused) JQUERY Files present in my WEB App's Code hierarchy?
[20:54:42] <bung> ?g requirejs
[20:54:43] <bot-t> bung, RequireJS - http://requirejs.org/
[20:55:20] <coldhead> Guddu: remove them all and add them back one at a time until it works?
[20:55:36] <Guddu> coldhead ok. :)
[20:56:23] <Guddu> coldhead:  I also have files like jquery.loadmask.css, jquery.color.js etc ... is there a wy to get new version of these files?
[20:57:09] <coldhead> Guddu: you might want to use require.js (as linked above) or something like bower
[20:57:24] <coldhead> if you're getting seriously into your version management
[20:57:39] <Guddu> Thanks coldhead ... Checking
[21:04:22] <ibodi> coldhead: do you have a better version of js::ord() ? this page also return different value vs php::ord() http://phpjs.org/functions/ord
[21:09:16] <Guddu> I downloaded jquery-ui-1.8.23 and inside the  js folder i see two files...jquery-ui-1.8.23.custom.min.js and  jquery-1.7.2.min.js ... Why do they have different numbers? And which one should i use?
[21:10:35] <ibodi> coldhead: found a good one. thanks anyway
[21:12:27] <coldhead> oh good work, ibodi
[21:24:40] <coldhead> good work everyone
[21:24:42] <coldhead> take five
[21:35:10] <dogarrhea2> how do you time the time between mouse movement events?
[21:36:54] <dogarrhea2> ok. it's not really that fine grained
[21:36:58] <dogarrhea2> milliseconds only
[21:56:18] <AlexWaters> can anyone tell me why the <form> tag is breaking this jquery? http://pastie.org/4660284
[21:56:34] <AlexWaters> i had to add the form tags so that I can make it dynamic, I had taken the jquery from a guide
[21:57:50] <coldhead> i don't think i was even born when that version of jQuery came out
[21:57:55] <coldhead> how is it "breaking"?
[21:59:23] <coldhead> it never pays to be dire
[22:00:40] <AlexWaters> coldhead: sorry haha, it is not executing the closeForm() function
[22:01:19] <coldhead> ah okay, don't use onclick with jQuery
[22:01:26] <ruby_on_tails> hi coldsy
[22:01:30] <coldhead> onclick is how people did this stuff in the 80s
[22:01:45] <AlexWaters> lol yes i haven't touched some of my code in months/years
[22:01:57] <coldhead> $('#sendMail').click(closeForm);
[22:02:01] <coldhead> in your JS
[22:02:02] <coldhead> should do it
[22:02:03] <AlexWaters> I didn't know I could date myself with jquery pasties
[22:02:11] <coldhead> heya rubsy
[22:02:27] <AlexWaters> coldhead: thank you!
[22:02:44] <coldhead> thank me when it works
[22:02:47] <coldhead> :P
[22:03:39] <ruby_on_tails> wassup
[22:03:40] <AlexWaters> coldhead: it didn't =( I put it just under my "text/javascript" declaration
[22:05:46] <coldhead> AlexWaters: put it within the $(document).ready(function(){
[22:10:34] <AlexWaters> coldhead: still no good http://pastie.org/4660320
[22:11:49] <coldhead> works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/d9AfJ/
[22:11:56] <coldhead> are you wanting the form not to submit?
[22:12:07] <AlexWaters> maybe i need to update my jqueryt
[22:12:19] <AlexWaters> i want to form to submit
[22:12:26] <AlexWaters> i just want it to do a cool fadeout =)
[22:12:37] <AlexWaters> i want the form to submit*
[22:14:55] <AlexWaters> updated to 1.8.1 - same issue. When I click submit it just closes the box instead of slowly closing it
[22:15:36] <AlexWaters> but if I remove the form tags, it works as anticipated
[22:17:06] <coldhead> how does it submit without the form tags?
[22:17:13] <AlexWaters> it doesn'
[22:17:19] <AlexWaters> it doesn't but the animation works
[22:17:23] <coldhead> okay
[22:19:11] <coldhead> something like this is required http://jsfiddle.net/d9AfJ/1/
[22:19:33] <coldhead> except in an ideal world you'd roll the closeForm into your submit handler
[22:19:36] <coldhead> and do it all in there
[22:19:38] <coldhead> for readability
[22:31:59] <AlexWaters> coldhead: that doesn't allow me to open the form. sorry i think i should have included the css earlier: http://pastie.org/4660320
[22:33:34] <coldhead> AlexWaters: can you add the CSS to the jsfiddle?
[22:33:39] <coldhead> and we can get try to get it working there?
[22:35:02] <AlexWaters> coldhead: I am new to jsfiddle - when I added the css the form disappeared
[22:35:43] <AlexWaters> oh i guess i need to point to the images
[22:36:08] <coldhead> its worth learning, AlexWaters :)
[22:37:03] <AlexWaters> ok i added the css
[22:37:11] <AlexWaters> now nothing is happening when i hit submit
[22:38:06] <AlexWaters> coldhead: this is pretty cool - I like how it lets you collaborate quickly
[22:38:35] <coldhead> this is why we use it
[22:38:43] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: saw this thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/cool-ascii-animation-using-an-image-sprite-canvas-and-javascript ?
[22:38:51] <coldhead> link me to the latest version, AlexWaters
[22:38:56] <coldhead> i didn't yet, ruby_on_tails
[22:38:59] <ruby_on_tails> sorry this http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/cool-ascii-animation-using-an-image-sprite-canvas-and-javascript
[22:39:05] <AlexWaters> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/d9AfJ/2/
[22:39:31] <coldhead> ruby_on_tails: did you see http://bit.ly/R4EhyC ?
[22:40:18] <kaushik_> hi
[22:40:19] <ruby_on_tails> thats is cool
[22:40:23] <ruby_on_tails> i will make something like that
[22:41:10] <coldhead> ah got it, AlexWaters http://jsfiddle.net/d9AfJ/3/
[22:41:26] <coldhead> it was calling submit which was calling submit which was calling submit etc
[22:41:39] <coldhead> so i changed it to $('form')[0].submit()
[22:41:40] <coldhead> and it works
[22:41:48] <coldhead> research why if you're terribly bored
[22:41:59] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: that has a hell of css
[22:42:10] <coldhead> 100 lines of SASS, ruby_on_tails :)
[22:42:27] <coldhead> this ascii animation is gorgeous
[22:42:33] <coldhead> makes me want drugs
[22:42:37] <ruby_on_tails> havent learnt sass yet
[22:42:52] <ruby_on_tails> lol
[22:43:03] <Brooke> I'm the sassmaster.
[22:43:07] <coldhead> its just CSS with loops and variables
[22:43:12] <coldhead> or at least that's what i cared about
[22:43:15] <coldhead> oh and functions
[22:44:00] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[22:46:02] <AlexWaters> coldhead: weird that it works on jsfiddle but not on my local. when I click the image on my local nothing happens (so I'm assuming the form is remaining hidden)
[22:46:02] <quiznilo> I'm testing for an array, but it's coming up 'true' for '[]'
[22:46:15] <quiznilo> any way to also test for '[]'?
[22:46:24] <quiznilo> is that just a string?
[22:46:45] <quiznilo> test for empty array?
[22:46:54] <coldhead> AlexWaters: can you check your firebug/web inspector console to see if there are errors locally?
[22:47:03] <quiznilo> oh wait, stack overflow
[22:47:14] <coldhead> also AlexWaters i assume you are using localhost and not file:///
[22:47:37] <quiznilo> arr.length===0
[22:48:51] <quiznilo> \o/
[22:48:56] <AlexWaters> coldhead: yes using localhost. on chrome =/
[22:49:07] <coldhead> any errors?
[22:49:27] <coldhead> AlexWaters: try copying and pasting a single expression at a time into the console
[22:49:30] <coldhead> to see where it fucks up
[22:49:43] <AlexWaters> coldhead: ah yes there was an out of place question mark
[22:49:58] <AlexWaters> coldhead: sorry. it works now. but when I hit submit, it doesn't slow close the form
[22:49:59] <coldhead> bam
[22:50:03] <AlexWaters> it still closes it quickly
[22:50:10] <coldhead> it closes it slowly in the fiddle
[22:50:46] <AlexWaters> coldhead: right when you click the image, but when I click the submit button in jsfiddle it shows a error 404
[22:51:31] <AlexWaters> coldhead: and when I remove the <form> tags - nothing happens when I click submit. whereas it used to slowly close
[22:52:57] <coldhead> AlexWaters: http://jsfiddle.net/d9AfJ/7/
[22:53:21] <AlexWaters> coldhead: nice. I'm just wondering if that is doing a different closing annimation
[22:53:24] <coldhead> AlexWaters: you probably really want to just do an ajax form submission
[22:53:37] <coldhead> and not have to worry about the submission proper
[22:53:47] <coldhead> read the code, man, you can change the animation if you want
[22:54:06] <AlexWaters> coldhead: I'm not familiar with ajax =( i should probably watch one of lynda's tutorials to catch up on javascript in general
[22:54:28] <coldhead> there are lots of good short tutes on ajax form submissions for contact forms
[22:54:29] <AlexWaters> coldhead: thank you very much. i'll check out how to do it in ajax
[22:54:33] <coldhead> it's just a few lines of code
[22:54:42] <coldhead> #jQuery is happy to help if you get stuck
[22:54:52] <AlexWaters> awesome! solid channel
[22:55:03] <coldhead> we like it
