[00:00:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[00:00:11] <robertmaxrees> what else would you do??
[00:01:25] <sydbarret> i dont know why it doesnt work
[00:01:26] <sydbarret> https://pasteboard.co/K1X2ewD.png
[00:01:58] <robertmaxrees> a png doesn't tell me anything :shrug: can you share the site?
[00:02:24] <sydbarret> is not live yet
[00:02:50] <sydbarret> basically i wanna add 3 li tags when user click that customer_id
[00:03:13] <sydbarret> the li tags will be 3 other options in my nav menu
[00:03:25] <robertmaxrees> before that click handler do console.log($('#customer_id').length);
[00:03:29] <robertmaxrees> see what you get.
[00:04:58] <sydbarret> i dont get nothing
[00:05:07] <sydbarret> is like if its not calling the function at all
[00:05:13] <robertmaxrees> do you have any js errors?
[00:05:27] <robertmaxrees> wait did you put the console log inside the click handler?
[00:06:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nbprt43u/ or did you do this
[00:07:46] <sydbarret> https://pasteboard.co/K1X4SWo.png
[00:07:56] <sydbarret> did this and console tag wont show nothing
[00:07:59] <sydbarret> no errors too
[00:08:07] <robertmaxrees> and you have the console open on pageload?
[00:10:39] <sydbarret> i got this violation msg
[00:10:40] <sydbarret> https://pasteboard.co/K1X60Xv.png
[00:10:56] <robertmaxrees> those aren't errors.  those are warnings.
[00:11:07] <sydbarret> could it be perhaps the script tag is in the wrong place
[00:11:32] <sydbarret> i also have
[00:11:36] <robertmaxrees> if it's a valid page, it'll be fine.  can you make a fiddle since screenshots don't do any good?
[00:11:38] <sydbarret> another script  with $(document).ready(function()
[00:11:51] <robertmaxrees> you can have multiples of those, though there's no reason to.
[00:23:49] <sydbarret> this works onload page   $(document).ready(function() {     alert("hello");    });
[00:23:56] <sydbarret> so error is in the inner function
[00:24:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess you have your console filtering stuff.
[00:24:25] <robertmaxrees> wait
[00:24:27] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[00:24:36] <robertmaxrees> that screenshot you sent has a "1" in it.
[00:25:05] <sydbarret> yes its a second saving
[00:25:15] <sydbarret> every time you save the version a counter increases
[00:25:25] <robertmaxrees> huh??
[00:25:46] <sydbarret> you mean in the url?
[00:25:48] <sydbarret> or where?
[00:26:01] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/xHnbTzJ.png
[00:26:25] <sydbarret> yes what does it mean
[00:26:30] <sydbarret> that i printed the lenght?
[00:26:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[00:27:06] <robertmaxrees> if you take that console log out does that not happen?
[00:30:27] <sydbarret> yes
[00:30:40] <robertmaxrees> then the element exists.
[00:31:01] <robertmaxrees> so onto the next issue.  going to guess datatables is doing a preventDefault or something.
[00:33:30] <sydbarret> so you mean thats why is not showing the alert?
[00:33:39] <robertmaxrees> yes
[00:34:14] <sydbarret> but if i put console.log
[00:34:19] <sydbarret> instead of alert will it work perhaps?
[00:34:32] <robertmaxrees> you can try, but probably not.
[00:37:50] <sydbarret> but all the code setting
[00:37:55] <sydbarret> for datatable is https://pasteboard.co/K1Xh0h9.png
[00:38:05] <sydbarret> i dont see any preventdefault
[00:38:21] <sydbarret> or you mean might be something built in?
[00:38:27] <robertmaxrees> built in.
[00:39:38] <robertmaxrees> also: pls stop with the screenshots.  if you want more help.  make a jsfiddle.
[00:41:59] <sydbarret> i think it has to be referenced in another way
[00:42:00] <sydbarret> https://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/events_live.html
[00:42:29] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: prolly.  i'd head to their forums if you have more questions.
[00:42:58] <sydbarret> yes thanks
[14:22:09] <paule32> hello
[14:22:31] <paule32> i have a problem with jquery + easyui
[14:22:35] <paule32> on my site:
[14:22:36] <paule32> https://www.kallup.net/pub/desk/index.php?bw_username=demo&bw_password=1234
[14:22:59] <paule32> you can see a an editor on right side, on the left a tree list
[14:23:50] <paule32> when i remove the text in the editor, and type "class fff of ddd endclass" (without the qoutes), the list items will be removed
[14:24:13] <paule32> now, when i press any key, the list will double an double it self
[14:24:47] <paule32> so, i it seems be a easyui question? or maybe somone here has a solution
[14:25:19] <paule32> you can see the page source, there on the javascript code in upper part of the page source
[15:55:18] <t2mkn> $(function() {.(function(){ alert($('#some_id').text()); })() });
[15:55:26] <t2mkn> don't work
[15:55:30] <t2mkn> why so
[15:56:06] <t2mkn> i can't use closures inside jQuery document ready ?
[15:58:40] <pavonia> The first dot, is that a modern JS feature or just wrong?
[16:00:08] <t2mkn> just wrong
[23:18:19] <robertmaxrees> t2mkn many hours later... closures are fine, but tossing an IIFE doesn't make any sense there.
[23:19:43] <robertmaxrees> the iife runs asap.  so the return of the iife is what the doc ready runs.  so it "works", but not the way you'd thinking.
