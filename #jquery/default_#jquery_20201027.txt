[10:01:27] <afidegnum> how do i add a custom css to background image opacity on ln: 11 of https://dpaste.org/GZsJ ? i wanted to add image opacity
[10:03:14] <Cork> afidegnum: you can't, future css standards has it on the way
[10:03:25] <Cork> but currently you have to have an element per opacity
[10:03:46] <afidegnum> ouch
[10:05:14] <Cork> https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images-4/#cross-fade-function
[10:07:16] <afidegnum> thanks
[10:09:02] <Cork> note, that is a draft, you can't use it
[10:15:18] <afidegnum> well, i m using CSS rather
[10:15:45] <Cork> uh, that is the css spec...
[10:16:01] <afidegnum> i man opacity:
[12:43:50] <afidegnum> anyone familiar with css? i'm in a little mess.
[12:44:03] <robertmaxrees> the css method of jquery?
[12:44:10] <afidegnum> no
[12:44:34] <robertmaxrees> ah - i mean, i am, but you'll probably have better luck in #css :)
[12:44:56] <afidegnum> the channel is dormant
[12:45:21] <afidegnum> hi, how do i remove the blue background covering the image at the portraits right after the slideshow  ? http://consuldrc.ga/
[12:45:26] <robertmaxrees> ah, looks like you're already asking elsewhere anyway.
[12:49:13] <robertmaxrees> also: the way to troubleshoot this sorta stuff is very straightforward - use your inspector, filter to "background", and un-check any background styles on the different elements until you see the change.,
[12:50:38] <afidegnum> i did but i can't see any feedback
[12:50:55] <afidegnum> i unchecked on the background, colors and opacities
[12:51:18] <robertmaxrees> .feature-box-8.active::before
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> that's your issue ;)
[12:51:59] <afidegnum> there is feature-box-8 active, i can't locate the ::before
[12:52:11] <afidegnum> good, i found it
[12:52:36] <afidegnum> no effect
[12:52:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "no effect"?
[12:52:51] <robertmaxrees> also: there are two blocks targeting that selector.
[12:53:06] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to modify both,.
[12:53:11] <afidegnum> ok
[12:56:43] <afidegnum> i've got it, .feature-box-8:before { content: "";
[12:56:53] <robertmaxrees> that's part of it, yes.
[12:57:03] <afidegnum> but it's strange, why should content be the the cause?
[12:57:09] <robertmaxrees> it isn't.
[12:57:17] <robertmaxrees> that entire block is the culprit.
[12:57:38] <robertmaxrees> inserting content and then styling it is causing the problem.
[12:59:05] <afidegnum> ok, i've found it, background-color: rgba(87, 137, 213, 0.9);
[12:59:11] <afidegnum> i need to change it's alpha state
[12:59:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:59:30] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what that block is doing?
[13:01:14] <afidegnum> yes, it shed the whole background color
[13:01:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:01:37] <afidegnum> i only changed the alpha: 0.9 to 0.1 - 2
[13:01:41] <afidegnum> or isn't it ?
[13:01:44] <robertmaxrees> it's more involved than that.
[13:01:52] <afidegnum> oh
[13:02:08] <robertmaxrees> changing the alpha isn't really "fixing" the problem.  it looks like you're editing library files directly, to boot, which is a bad idea.
[13:02:20] <robertmaxrees> are you sure you're using the css framework correctly?
[13:02:41] <afidegnum> i gues
[13:02:42] <afidegnum> guess
[13:03:23] <robertmaxrees> this bug looks like you're misusing features.  you shouldn't be editing library files to "fix" things, so I would re-evaluate how you implemented that feature by correcting the markup.
[16:53:23] <ckb> okay friends. I'm having a brain block on how to pass a parameter to $.ajax
[16:53:48] <robertmaxrees> shoot
[16:54:55] <ckb> I think I know the answer to my question (a solution)
[16:55:07] <robertmaxrees> 'k :)
[16:55:17] <ckb> but if I want to get the form that was submitted...
[16:55:31] <robertmaxrees> can you show some code?
[16:56:03] <ckb> like $(document).on('submit', 'form', function() {}); how can I get the submitting form data
[16:56:14] <robertmaxrees> 'this' will reference the form.
[16:56:32] <ckb> ah, my main question is if I use .ajax
[16:56:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:56:56] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow your quesation then.
[16:57:04] <robertmaxrees> *question
[16:58:00] <ckb> yes so if I initialize/instantiate a variable outside of .ajax, I can't use them because it's async
[16:58:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can.
[16:58:21] <robertmaxrees> anything you do before the $.ajax() will happen, well, before.
[16:58:24] <robertmaxrees> so the variable exists.
[16:58:57] <robertmaxrees> and then you can use it as part of the $.ajax() call.  the async part only matters for code that's "after" the async operation.
[16:59:03] <ckb> I don't really NEED the async in this case.
[16:59:28] <robertmaxrees> can you show what you're trying to do?  it feels like there's a major disconnect here.
[16:59:33] <ckb> the async callback is what I'm referring to
[16:59:41] <robertmaxrees> you mean the .then()?
[16:59:50] <ckb> yeah one second. let me think real quick
[17:00:13] <robertmaxrees> because even then, vars defined before the $.ajax() call will exist when the .then() runs.
[17:00:17] <robertmaxrees> so long as you're in the same scope.
[17:01:35] <ckb> I have a button (file upload/multipart form) that needs to submit on change (file selected). There's 2 different forms with actions I'm trying to submit (depending on what .change)
[17:02:21] <robertmaxrees> can you just show the code?  it sounds liek there's a fundamental disconnect going on here.
[17:02:29] <robertmaxrees> *like
[17:03:02] <ckb> yeah, it might be messy
[17:03:32] <robertmaxrees> that's fine...
[17:03:38] <robertmaxrees> just need the handler.
[17:05:21] <ckb> @robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/bzLvx85y/
[17:05:42] <robertmaxrees> lol - there's a "javascript" box for javascript :)
[17:05:51] <ckb> there's a MUCH easier way for me to do this, I'm just trying to figure out why that won't work
[17:06:00] <robertmaxrees> that does work.
[17:06:07] <robertmaxrees> what about it "won't work"?
[17:06:20] <ckb> says form isn't an HTMLElement
[17:06:34] <robertmaxrees> because it's '$(this)' - you need just 'this'
[17:06:35] <ckb> voicemails.php?type=secondary&ext=100:449 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'FormData': parameter 1 is not of type 'HTMLFormElement'.
[17:06:38] <ckb> OOF
[17:06:52] <ckb> Failed to construct 'FormData': parameter 1 is not of type 'HTMLFormElement'.
[17:07:40] <robertmaxrees> you mentioned a 'change' handler earlier, not a submit.
[17:07:48] <robertmaxrees> are you doing this on change or on submit?
[17:08:35] <ckb> it's just a "submit" on the parents("form")
[17:09:38] <robertmaxrees> then there's something you're not sharing here :)
[17:09:42] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sLckdey1/3/ - this works.
[17:19:00] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music
[17:19:33] <ckb> just need to work with it for a while :D
[17:19:45] <robertmaxrees> if you're still having issues feel free to share more code and we can try to help.
[17:24:02] <ckb> Even on .submit() my multipart isn't getting submitted
[17:24:17] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to upload an image?
[17:25:03] <ckb> I am halfway dumb.
[17:25:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:25:12] <ckb> Disregard me
[17:25:14] <ckb> XD
[17:25:18] <robertmaxrees> what was the issue?
[17:25:28] <ckb> I didn't have a name attr on the file
[17:25:53] <robertmaxrees> ah gotcha.  might also need to set contentType and processData to false.
[17:26:12] <ckb> I had it originally
[17:30:09] <igcewieling> I'm still a bit of a n00b.  Is there any reason to use this $('body').append('<iframe id="live" style="display:none;"></iframe>').attr('src', '?module=live'); rather than this $('body').append('<iframe id="live" src="?module=live" style="display:none;"></iframe>');  ?
[17:31:50] <robertmaxrees> would need to know what the iframe contains.  might need to have the iframe in the document before trying to load it.
[17:32:00] <robertmaxrees> rather, the tag in the page.
[17:35:23] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling make sense?
[17:38:53] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: in the first case the src is set immediately, in the second case the src is only set after the iframe documentready fires?
[17:39:05] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:39:22] <igcewieling> errr...sorry, I reversed them.
[17:39:42] <robertmaxrees> the first case appends the iframe to tbe body, then sets the src afterwards.  the second case has the source set technically before it's appended to the document.
[17:39:48] <robertmaxrees> so it starts loading before appended in the second case.
[17:40:26] <igcewieling> That helps.  Thanks.
[17:40:43] <igcewieling> I don't do much with jquery.
