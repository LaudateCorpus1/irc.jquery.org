[00:06:30] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[00:07:37] <Uhkis> probably
[00:07:51] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  hey
[00:07:52] <hellyeah> i want to make p appear in the dialog box what did it do wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/5/
[00:10:39] <Uhkis> hellyeah: there's a typo in your html
[00:11:13] <hellyeah> typo hmm
[00:11:20] <Uhkis> "classs"
[00:11:30] <hellyeah> oh damn
[00:11:32] <hellyeah> :D
[00:12:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:12:16] <hellyeah> i have 70 percentage loss in my seeing perspective
[00:12:27] <hellyeah> sorry about that sometimes i just missed
[00:13:01] <Uhkis> no need to apologize, it happens to the best of us
[00:13:07] <suexec> hellyeah, common problem :)
[00:13:08] <hellyeah> ic
[00:13:12] <hellyeah> :D
[00:13:37] <hellyeah> thanks for understanding. it is good thing.
[00:15:09] <hellyeah> btw it was better if i gave width and height inside open function
[00:15:11] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/7/
[00:16:04] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/oa5kxu1z/ <--- why isn't this doing its thing?
[00:16:09] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/8/
[00:18:41] <Uhkis> Kartagis: it is
[00:18:57] <Kartagis> not for me
[00:18:59] <hellyeah> giving width and height like that is a bad practice http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/10/
[00:19:26] <Uhkis> Kartagis: it is, you just don't see it because you're setting val instead of text
[00:19:35] <hellyeah> i have purpose thats why i am asking
[00:20:54] <Kartagis> I need to memorise what is .text(), what is .val(), what is .innerHTML, what is .innerText, what element takes what etc etc
[00:21:11] <Kartagis> Uhkis: have a cheat sheet for that?
[00:21:23] <Uhkis> Kartagis: it's pretty simple, text is text, value is value, html is html :D
[00:22:28] <Uhkis> and no, i don't have a cheatsheet for that, it's so self explanatory
[00:25:18] <Uhkis> Kartagis: think <option value="4">Four</option>, val() = 4, text() = Four, html the whole shebang
[00:26:30] <Kartagis> uhm
[00:28:01] <hellyeah> why it looks bad positioned when you hit modal window in second time. It was positioned properly. http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/13/
[00:31:28] <Uhkis> hellyeah: it seems to remember the position where it was last and your css gets overridden after first close
[00:31:54] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:31:57] <hellyeah> so
[00:32:10] <hellyeah> i need to meantion position of pop up box in first place
[00:32:28] <hellyeah> like that   position: {                 my: "center top",                 at: "right top",                 collision: "fit fit",                 of: window             },
[00:33:48] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  i used global var for that do you have better suggestion i just want to do responsive pop up box? http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/14/
[00:34:10] <hellyeah> but it worked great
[00:34:23] <hellyeah> chec this out http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/15/
[00:45:48] <STFUn00b> any jqm experts here?
[00:46:29] <Uhkis> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/19/
[00:47:42] <hellyeah> ah
[00:47:46] <hellyeah> i didnt know that wway
[00:47:50] <hellyeah> i was close damn it
[00:47:53] <hellyeah> :)
[00:48:30] <Uhkis> hellyeah: both work but that just seems cleaner
[00:48:31] <STFUn00b> anyway... i have this strange problem that occurs only on ipad and iphones. it works everywhere else i tested (even on IE9). i'm using jqm1.4.5, and i created my own collapsible set... actually nothing fancy, just couple of divs, that show/hide next div. no special styling (like strange positioning or smth). the problem is that when i expand couple of my collapsibles, they get cut off at the bottom of the viewport. to sum it up: par
[00:48:37] <STFUn00b> and i can't scroll it...
[00:48:43] <STFUn00b> how's that possible?
[00:49:09] <STFUn00b> the only thing that container has set on it, is min-height property, which jqm sets by itself
[00:49:13] <STFUn00b> any ideas?
[00:49:14] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  thank you
[00:49:17] <Uhkis> ios sucks? ;) :D
[00:49:34] <hellyeah> thanks to you no need to use global var
[00:49:57] <STFUn00b> when i set height to smth crazy like 10000px, content of collapsibles is visible and i can scroll the container div normally
[00:50:36] <STFUn00b> one workaround would be, to manually set the height when i expand/collapse an item, but that's hacky :\
[00:51:36] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/20/embedded/result/ when you click first time. Positionning is weird i just added some code here for positioning can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/20/embedded/result/
[00:51:40] <hellyeah> ops
[00:55:28] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  can i write like that can you look at it i just try to give maxWidth and minWidth instead of giving width? http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/21/
[00:59:51] <Uhkis> hellyeah: should work fine
[01:00:59] <hellyeah> hmm
[01:01:05] <hellyeah> this is a problem it seems
[01:03:26] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  * 15 should give me really big number i suppose to get box more width seems it worked but not %100 any ideA? http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/24/
[01:04:09] <Kartagis> are fiddles kept forever?
[01:04:27] <Kartagis> they must have really big data by now
[01:05:14] <hellyeah> i guess if you dont log in, they will remove in some period
[01:39:49] <guzzlefry> evening
[01:41:22] <guzzlefry> I'm trying to get the response status for $.post(). Right now I'm doing $.post('example.com/api/whatever').done(function (xhr) { console.log(xhr.status); }); and that dumps out undefined. Any ideas?
[01:42:20] <Cork> guzzlefry: done doesn't give you xhr
[01:42:36] <guzzlefry> ah, only fail?
[01:43:08] <Cork> guzzlefry: .done(function(data, status) {})
[01:43:08] <guzzlefry> Under what exact conditions is .done() fired?
[01:43:16] <guzzlefry> ah, thanks
[01:43:29] <Cork> guzzlefry: the server returns 200 and no code exception
[01:43:41] <Cork> or rather the server returns 2xx and no code exceptions
[01:43:54] <guzzlefry> ah okay, so 301, 302, etc are .always() I guess?
[01:44:00] <Cork> no
[01:44:05] <Cork> 3xx is invisible to js
[01:44:12] <Cork> you only see the result
[01:44:43] <Cork> meaning ex. post > status 3xx > browser follows > staus 200 > triggers .done
[01:44:53] <guzzlefry> ah I see...that's not good. :P
[01:45:10] <Cork> well it depends on how you look at it
[01:45:36] <Cork> if you want to handle the redirect in code set a location header and send a status 200 instead
[01:46:14] <guzzlefry> The framework I'm using on the server side returns a 302 to redirect the user to a login form when they hit the api path. :/
[01:46:42] <Cork> guzzlefry: even for ajax calls?
[01:46:58] <Cork> that's... broken...
[01:46:59] <guzzlefry> yeah...which seems dumb
[01:47:17] <Cork> guzzlefry: the only option you have is to look in the data response for something from the login page
[01:47:31] <Cork> ex $(data).find('form#login').length > 0
[01:47:45] <Cork> (though don't use a selector like that)
[01:48:41] <Cork> guzzlefry: i would recommend to file a bug up steam so they can fix it to return a 406 instead
[01:50:00] <morphyeys> Hello guys, it's not returning me anything any ideas why http://pastebin.com/CnGYK1iV /
[01:50:33] <Cork> morphyeys: bind the error/fail handler
[01:50:44] <morphyeys> I am a total newbie
[01:51:27] <Cork> $.ajax(url).done(function(data) {}).fail(function(xhr, status, exception) {})
[01:51:41] <Cork> .done is the same as the old success: you're using now
[01:52:29] <Cork> morphyeys: also dataType isn't valid
[01:52:35] <morphyeys> why
[01:53:32] <Cork> cause your giving it the JSON obect
[01:53:36] <Cork> it should be a string
[01:54:10] <morphyeys> ahh it's working now
[01:54:36] <hellyeah> hey
[01:54:43] <hellyeah> this is what i try to do setting width and height according to length of text and amount of lines in the text http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/26/ there may be some problems i need to check may be? What do you think?
[01:54:57] <hellyeah> any suggestion ?
[01:55:29] <Cork> morphyeys: http://jsfiddle.net/6uj8t4y1/
[02:06:52] <morphyeys> Cork, it's working http://pastebin.com/sP4QiB23
[02:07:19] <Cork> morphyeys: you should still bind an error handler
[02:07:33] <Cork> honestly you should always bind one
[02:10:17] <AcidBeard> hellyeah: I'm not sure what you mean.
[02:12:02] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  i just try to width and height dynamically according to length of text(width) and how many lines in the p(height) http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/29/
[02:13:16] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  yo got what i tried?
[02:16:43] <morphyeys> Cork, okay can I use success and not done?
[02:17:06] <Cork> morphyeys: sure, you can use error instead of .fail too
[02:17:22] <Cork> though .done and .fail usually result in a more readable code section
[02:17:35] <morphyeys> okay
[02:17:40] <morphyeys> thank you very much
[02:18:33] <exs> Hi
[02:18:34] <Cork> morphyeys: have a look at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ if you want more info about how .ajax works
[02:18:55] <morphyeys> yes okay but my code is fine I just need to bind an error handler?
[02:19:10] <Cork> find?
[02:19:23] <Cork> its just a function you need to define in the object
[02:19:54] <Cork> (or use the deferred function .fail like i explained before)
[02:21:07] <exs> I need some help. I try to use a script with jquery as a dependencies. this script is suppose to be used in a page where I dont know if there is already jquery present, or which version or another js libraries using $. Can I use some mecahnism without conflicts?
[02:21:47] <Cork> exs: just check if $.jquery exist
[02:21:59] <Cork> it should be a string with the version number
[02:22:38] <hellyeah> hey can you check line 10 and 12 http://jsfiddle.net/0qns8hme/31/ why it didnt work or it worked. I dont get it
[02:24:42] <exs> Cork: I found a situation where there was the variable jQuery existing but $ was not a function.
[02:25:03] <exs> Some jQuery 1.11.* script was loaded
[02:25:26] <Cork> exs: ya, you can load jqeury without it owning $
[02:25:34] <Cork> that shouldn't break any plugins through
[02:27:09] <exs> Cork: So in such case i just use jQuery for $?
[02:27:38] <Cork> if you want to use jQuery without caring if it owns $ just always use jQuery
[02:27:42] <Cork> it has to always exist
[02:27:46] <Cork> $ doesn't
[02:28:05] <Cork> if you want to use $ without caring
[02:28:25] <Cork> just use jQuery(function($) { $ === jQuery })
[02:28:33] <Cork> or  (function($) { $ === jQuery })(jQuery)
[02:28:41] <Cork> depending of you want .ready or just a wrapper
[02:29:13] <AcidBeard> I usually make my own JQ variable, like $jQ = jQuery;
[02:29:25] <Cork> don't
[02:29:37] <Cork> you shouldn't define globals if you don't have to
[02:30:29] <AcidBeard> I don't do it if I have control of the whole project.  Only if there are conflicts.
[02:30:38] <AcidBeard> Mainly in userScripts
[02:30:47] <Cork> ya, but you shouldn't define it as a global
[02:31:01] <AcidBeard> Why?
[02:31:04] <Cork> though userScripts runs in a separate scope
[02:31:08] <Cork> AcidBeard: name conflicts
[02:31:15] <Cork> you risk writing over something
[02:32:43] <AcidBeard> I suppose but hasn't been as issue yet
[02:32:58] <Cork> at least not an issue you've detected yet :)
[02:33:19] <Cork> but ya, like i said userscripts run in a separate scope to start with
[02:33:34] <Cork> so you don't get name conflicts unless you explicitly inject the variable into the page
[02:59:38] <toomus> hi all
[03:00:58] <arckai> Hello I need help with a calculation anyone here?
[03:01:32] <Cork> arckai: don't ask to ask
[03:01:34] <Cork> just ask
[03:02:00] <toomus> Why this timeout executes onlu once? http://pastie.org/10309540
[03:02:09] <arckai> http://arboticus.com/a/zoom.php
[03:02:17] <arckai> That is what I am working on
[03:02:31] <arckai> When I zoom after the image is twice itś initial size
[03:02:37] <arckai> it should zoom to the mousepoint
[03:02:42] <Cork> toomus: cause it's a setTimeout it is meant to only fire once
[03:02:55] <arckai> but it is always a few pixels to much on the left why?
[03:03:12] <Xatenev> arckai: what?
[03:03:14] <Cork> toomus: you need to set it up every time you want it to go
[03:03:26] <toomus> Cork: ahhh OK :)
[03:03:57] <Cork> arckai: start by fixing the html
[03:03:59] <Cork> its broken
[03:04:28] <Cork> 1. old legacy doctype you shouldn't use, 2. error in the markup, style tags where they aren't allowed
[03:04:30] <Cork> and maybe more
[03:04:39] <Cork> ah dangling </div>
[03:06:37] <Cork> arckai: https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Farboticus.com%2Fa%2Fzoom.php&doctype=HTML+4.01+Transitional
[03:13:44] <hellyeah> hey
[03:14:20] <arckai> https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Farboticus.com%2Fa%2Fzoom.php ok I fixed the HTML
[03:14:28] <arckai> now what about the javascript
[03:14:33] <arckai> zimage.js
[03:14:42] <arckai> has the calulation
[03:15:25] <arckai> It always adds a few extra pixels to the left of the image css using left I should be a smooth zoom
[03:15:53] <Cork> arckai: is the js suppose to do anything right now?
[03:15:59] <arckai> The zoom starts after the image is twice the size so that it does not leave white space to the right of the image in the container when zooming
[03:16:19] <arckai> yes when you scroll the mousewhell on the image it should zoom
[03:16:27] <arckai> *mousewheel
[03:16:33] <Cork> it doesn't
[03:16:48] <Cork> ah
[03:16:51] <Cork> you have to hover the image
[03:17:23] <arckai> No it must zoom within the container of the image
[03:18:19] <Cork> arckai: have you tried using css transform?
[03:18:28] <Cork> it should make things quite a bit easier
[03:18:45] <arckai> No I havent tried transform will look into it now
[03:18:52] <Cork> cause, ya that is too much code for me to go into right now
[03:19:09] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[03:19:40] <Cork> that property was invented by apple basically exactly for this kine of animations
[03:20:16] <arckai> from what point does the transform scale from?
[03:20:37] <Cork> depends on what origin you set
[03:20:50] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin
[03:26:20] <arckai> Ok I am going to look into this seams better than position the scalled image using the css left and top attribute
[03:27:06] <Cork> arckai: ya, that means you do the scaling with the cpu and full dom modifications
[03:27:19] <Cork> while transform scales with the gpu, without modifying the dom
[03:27:23] <Cork> so it is a lot faster
[03:31:30] <arckai> I am going to try and using a transform translate to position the scaled image
[03:47:42] <arckai> a=100px
[03:47:44] <arckai> b=200px
[03:47:49] <arckai> c=10px
[03:47:55] <arckai> d=0px
[03:48:21] <arckai> a is a sqaure that is 100px high by 100px wide
[03:48:31] <arckai> b is a sqaure that is 200px high by 200px wide
[03:48:51] <arckai> c is where the mouse clicked in a
[03:49:00] <arckai> d is where the mouse clicked in b
[04:00:34] <hellyeah> hey anyone around
[04:00:39] <hellyeah> i just try to size the box
[04:00:48] <hellyeah> but it doesnt seem to work can you help https://jsfiddle.net/uye3o42c/7/
[04:02:08] <decx> what?
[04:11:57] <AcidBeard> hellyeah: Why not wrap the inner text in a span?
[04:13:16] <decx> using an inline element when you don't want a block? that's downright logical
[04:13:21] <hellyeah> i dont know about span much can you give me example fiddle?
[04:18:33] <AcidBeard> Sure, one second
[04:20:01] <AcidBeard> Here, but I realized there was something wrong in the fiddle you sent https://jsfiddle.net/AramisBlack/uye3o42c/21/
[04:21:18] <AcidBeard> Here is the result of your original code but with the proper selectors: https://jsfiddle.net/AramisBlack/uye3o42c/22/
[04:22:56] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  btw examine this address https://jsfiddle.net/uye3o42c/15/   https://jsfiddle.net/uye3o42c/19/  https://jsfiddle.net/uye3o42c/20/ is it understandable? i just try to size the box that surrounds the text. No wasted space?
[04:23:26] <hellyeah> this was my aim
[04:23:33] <hellyeah> i guess adding span is the trick
[04:24:25] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  yes i see my wrong
[04:25:49] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  that was i tried to do
[04:32:40] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  still there?
[04:32:58] <AcidBeard> Yeah, what's up?
[04:33:39] <hellyeah> i exxpect to have small pop up boxes but the result is not like that? try to do this like that is wrong http://jsfiddle.net/uye3o42c/38/
[04:35:13] <hellyeah> i just want to set width and height of the pop up box
[04:39:48] <hellyeah> i just made it i guess
[04:43:38] <AcidBeard> http://jsfiddle.net/AramisBlack/uye3o42c/40/
[04:43:48] <AcidBeard> That should get you more of what you're looking for.
[04:46:18] <AcidBeard> Well, maybe not
[04:46:21] <AcidBeard> One second
[04:46:32] <saransh__> how can i add a cookie in header?
[04:47:28] <AcidBeard> You mean set a cookie in JS?
[04:47:53] <saransh__> <AcideBeard>: No, i mean i want to add a cookie in header
[04:48:23] <saransh__> can we do that?
[04:51:14] <AcidBeard> saransh__: I Don't think I understand what you are trying to do.
[04:52:22] <AcidBeard> hellyeah: What is your goal here?  To make a dialog box that is just the right size?
[04:52:31] <hellyeah> yes
[04:52:33] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:
[04:53:12] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  http://jsfiddle.net/uye3o42c/43/
[04:53:39] <saransh__> <AcidBeard>: I am using a third party service to send my form data
[04:53:45] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  http://jsfiddle.net/uye3o42c/44/
[04:53:52] <saransh__> I want a specific cookie to send along with that data
[04:54:03] <hellyeah> you will understand what i am after
[04:54:56] <AcidBeard> saransh__:  You can get the cookie vlue and send that but I don't know if you can do it any other way
[04:55:16] <saransh__> Yes that cookie is present on the page
[04:55:43] <saransh__> <AcidBeard>: The issue is when i get that cookie, then i will make a call to third party api
[04:56:21] <saransh__> *after i get the cookie and submit a form, it will make a call to third party api
[04:56:26] <AcidBeard> Did the API set the cookie or did your server?
[04:56:50] <AcidBeard> hellyeah: Why not just make your own dialogbox?
[04:56:50] <saransh__> I got that cookie on my server
[04:57:08] <saransh__> now i want to send it along with api data
[04:58:08] <saransh__> and i don't control the submission of form, when a user submits it, it will make a request to particular webhook
[04:58:28] <AcidBeard> saransh__:  You can't access cookies set by another domain
[04:58:54] <saransh__> I don't want to access it
[04:59:08] <AcidBeard> You want another server to access it.
[04:59:19] <saransh__> I just want to send it back to that domain itself
[04:59:40] <AcidBeard> You need to get the cookie value and send it with the form
[04:59:44] <saransh__> no, that cookie is generated by the service which stores my form data
[05:00:02] <AcidBeard> Then that cookie is already being sent to the server
[05:00:04] <saransh__> <AcidBeard>: How can i do that?
[05:00:17] <saransh__> attaching it with the form
[05:00:25] <AcidBeard> Put it in a hidden field
[05:00:36] <saransh__> how?
[05:03:40] <AcidBeard> How are you embedding the form in your page?
[05:05:23] <AcidBeard> Are you using <script> ir <iframe> or ....?
[05:17:34] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  i dont know how to do that
[05:17:39] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  i am just beginner
[05:17:47] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  is it easy to make my own dialog box
[05:27:33] <AcidBeard> I think it is but probably not if you are just starting
[05:33:17] <hellyeah> hey
[05:33:29] <hellyeah> how can i give id to p i did smt but seems not working http://jsfiddle.net/uye3o42c/46/
[05:37:20] <AcidBeard> <p class="par1">
[05:37:36] <AcidBeard> You made a typo
[05:38:52] <hellyeah> yes
[05:38:56] <hellyeah> ops
[05:39:10] <hellyeah> AcidBeard:  actually i want to add id to p
[05:39:37] <hellyeah> it will seem like that <p id="p1" class="par1">
[05:42:26] <AcidBeard> What you did isn't a good way to do that because if you have multiple elements with class "par1" all will get the ID and IDs should be unique
[05:51:15] <AcidBeard> I'm about to get off but here are a couple of ways you could do it: http://jsfiddle.net/AramisBlack/uye3o42c/51/
[05:53:58] <decx> keep clicking the button ^^
[05:54:17] <hellyeah> hahah
[05:54:22] <hellyeah> why does it happen?
[05:54:35] <hellyeah> dont get it
[05:54:39] <hellyeah> am i weird
[05:54:46] <hellyeah> or is dialog box weird?
[05:56:05] <hellyeah> text is there
[05:56:19] <hellyeah> but calculation width and height is a mess
[05:56:31] <hellyeah> dunno what should i do
[06:22:26] <morphyeys> have a nice evening guys and a great weekend
[06:49:12] <senordonquijote> hello
[06:49:16] <senordonquijote> How can I  make javascript to only show a message once and not every time a button is clicked?
[06:49:29] <mdev> set a global variable
[06:49:35] <mdev> and check it before showing the alert
[06:49:52] <senordonquijote> wait I will paste the code…
[06:50:06] <mdev> var shownpopup = 0; outside of any function, so globally accessible
[06:50:28] <mdev> then if(shownpopup==0) do your popup and set shownpopup = 1;
[06:51:25] <senordonquijote> here http://pastebin.com/dR5JRUwd
[06:54:01] <senordonquijote> thanks, tried it but it does not work, the message is added to the page content every time I click the button
[06:57:03] <senordonquijote> @mdev: ah, sorry i put the var still into a function, now it works!
[06:57:06] <senordonquijote> thank you
[07:07:24] <senordonquijote> @mdev: maybe you can help me again with this: how can I hide the error message (that was shown with $this.before) when the form was correctly submitted?
[07:19:32] <NoiseEee> senordonquijote: if there's no longer an error, make "hasError" false
[07:20:53] <senordonquijote> but that should be done already by using      if(!hasError) {      right?
[07:21:33] <NoiseEee> hmm?
[07:22:02] <NoiseEee> if(!hasError) just says "if hasError is false / not truthy"
[07:24:49] <dquery> could someone tell me how i could match an ID with a href and then show the relevant content of the ID block?
[07:25:32] <dquery> http://jsfiddle.net/noxxxLa0/#&togetherjs=q5TBAjUVAq
[07:25:49] <dquery> im pretty new to jquery but it's so hard to get the simplest stuff to work!!!
[07:30:23] <dquery> is anyone able to gimme a hand here?
[07:31:45] <arckai> ID with a href and then show the relevant content of the ID block
[07:32:10] <arckai> $(¨#id > href)
[07:32:19] <arckai> $(¨#id > href).html()
[07:33:26] <dquery> sorry i don't understand, could you elaborate?
[07:42:47] <Tekkkz> Hi
[07:43:10] <Tekkkz> is it possible to connect a website/webapplication with a server via UDP?
[07:45:52] <senordonquijote> @NoiseEee:  $(‚.error‘).hide();   does the trick!
[07:46:19] <NoiseEee> senordonquijote: i see;  your question could perhaps have been a little clearer.
[07:47:09] <senordonquijote> so what YOU had asked int his case?
[07:48:19] <NoiseEee> senordonquijote: after I've displayed the error, how can I remove it or hide it.
[07:48:35] <NoiseEee> senordonquijote: the code you posted was not helpful in your issue; all it showed was "if has an error, show the error"
[07:48:59] <NoiseEee> senordonquijote: and your question was "how to not show the error",  so the natural response was "make it not have an error"
[07:49:19] <NoiseEee> anyways glad its working, senordonquijote
[07:50:28] <senordonquijote> okay thank you for your help! I appreciate it!
[08:02:22] <tejasmanohar> hey with jquery what can i used to pass a function argument for when the promise request is failed

[08:17:27] <str8uplinux> I am using the following script to upload multiple files to a php file. Everything works fine until the size of the files TOTAL over 10MB. At this point print_r($_REQUEST) shows no data. I have set my upload_max_filesize to 50M. I will also post this in ##php unless someone knows off hand?
[08:17:33] <str8uplinux> http://pastie.org/10309981
[08:23:55] <NoiseEee> str8uplinux: increase the post_max_size
[08:27:00] <NoiseEee> str8uplinux: (in php; also this is a php question)
[08:31:29] <Herehere> Does anyone can help me with a datatable? Its more related with programming in general
[08:31:35] <Herehere> https://dpaste.de/TGQX
[08:32:29] <str8uplinux> NoiseEee: thanks that worked!
[08:32:33] <Herehere> ah nevermind, I dont even know how to ask lol
[08:34:42] <str8uplinux> NoiseEee: would it make more sense to do a separate post for every file to avoid this?
[08:34:59] <NoiseEee> str8uplinux: not if you have control over php.ini
[09:11:53] <bancik> hi, does the enabling of firebug causes some jquery code to be executed ?
[09:12:01] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[09:13:40] <markholmes> bancik, no, how come?
[09:14:04] <bancik> the thing is that my leaflet maps have some gray spaces
[09:14:25] <bancik> and when I turn on firebug or the chrome dev tools
[09:14:39] <bancik> my maps get redrawed properly
[09:14:45] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you resize the window?
[09:14:51] <robertmaxrees> instead of open the tools?
[09:16:02] <bancik> nothing
[09:16:23] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[09:17:46] <bancik> indeed :)
[09:18:28] <bancik> thanks anyway
[09:41:42] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: can you help me with the loaders BillCriswell gave me last night?
[09:41:55] <Kartagis> I got lost
[09:51:42] <shahin8r> Guys, anyone care to take a look at http://pastebin.com/8Hmrbevj - really simple but can't get my head around to solve it.
[09:52:25] <sash_> shahin8r: Please use something else to paste, e.g. jsfiddle
[09:53:18] <shahin8r> sash_: sorry, it's not a working example just two simple lines. :)
[10:00:22] <shahin8r> simple .index() and .eq() did the trick.
[10:04:42] <sash_> shahin8r: https://jsfiddle.net/413k4t8o/
[10:08:23] <shahin8r> thanks, not next problem. is there a way to check if all elements with class .box are 100%? like if ($('.box').width('100%)) {}
[10:08:26] <shahin8r> now*
[10:08:39] <shahin8r> nvm the typos
[10:08:54] <sash_> $('.box').each(function(){ /* stuff here */})
[10:09:34] <shahin8r> but if i want something to run when all of boxes are 100%? doesn't this do something at each .box?
[10:09:52] <sash_> The test is inside the loop
[10:10:04] <robertmaxrees> you can .filter() to see if any aren't.
[10:10:11] <robertmaxrees> of there aren't, do your thang.
[10:10:33] <robertmaxrees> *if, rather
[10:10:43] <shahin8r> superb! i'll try that right away
[10:12:13] <robertmaxrees> except .css() will pull the computed value iirc.
[10:31:05] <shahin8r> ok, how to check if element has width of 100%
[10:31:23] <shahin8r> $('.box').width == '100%' doesn't work
[10:31:55] <shahin8r> is .width == 100 enough?
[10:36:10] <vacho> $.getJSON('api.php')
[10:36:24] <vacho> I can't call like that? getting SyntaxError: missing : after property id
[10:49:49] <robertmaxrees> vacho because you're not returning JSON out of that php
[11:25:46] <robertmaxrees> bleep bloop.
[11:25:50] <robertmaxrees> i need to figure out lunch.
[11:27:44] <vacho> I am getting TypeError: settings.map[0] is undefined when I run this: map: $.getJSON( "api.php") ..but when I replace my getJSON call with the actual return value of api.php it works.. basically hard coding it ..it works fine.
[11:28:19] <vacho> I made sure the headers returned by api.php is set to JSON too..but still it seems that it cannot read it
[11:30:00] <robertmaxrees> vacho share your code in a paste or something.
[11:30:24] <vacho> robertmaxrees: here's my JSON URI: http://biztech.setmedialab.com/seats/api.php
[11:30:58] <vacho> robertmaxrees: my JS http://pastebin.com/TnPzpgqd
[11:31:15] <vacho> robertmaxrees: notice line 9 is commented out...
[11:31:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:31:45] <robertmaxrees> i'm way confused.
[11:32:06] <robertmaxrees> ah
[11:32:09] <robertmaxrees> map: $.getJSON( "api.php"), doesn't work.
[11:32:14] <vacho> robertmaxrees: sorry I will try to explain better.. notice this JSON: http://biztech.setmedialab.com/seats/api.php
[11:32:37] <robertmaxrees> right - i get it now - map: $.getJSON( "api.php"), does not assign map to the data that getJSON call returns.
[11:33:13] <vacho> robertmaxrees: look at my JS, on line 2... I want to get that json structure from api.php instead of having it coded there
[11:33:17] <robertmaxrees> that's because $.getJSON() is async - it first off the request and your code keeps going.  It returns a deferred object instead of the return opbject.
[11:33:30] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm explaining the problem right now.
[11:33:30] <vacho> robertmaxrees: ooh..I see!
[11:33:46] <vacho> robertmaxrees: I had this issue once before too I remember..don't remember how I got around it
[11:34:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd define the object up ahead and then call seatCharts() when the ajax finishes.
[11:35:51] <vacho> you mean instantiate seatCharts, then call JSON and in it's callback pass the json data to the map function?
[11:35:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:36:16] <robertmaxrees> create a config object.
[11:36:22] <robertmaxrees> without the ajax call in it.
[11:36:56] <robertmaxrees> then call $.getJSON("api.php").done(function(returnData) {}); - in the callback for done, set the map property of the config object with the returned data and then call the seatCharts method.
[11:37:15] <vacho> robertmaxrees: great, thanks let me try that!
[11:37:34] <robertmaxrees> something like https://bpaste.net/show/19574bcd8d24
[11:39:24] <vacho> robertmaxrees: that actually worked !! thank you so much!
[11:39:57] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: can you help me with the loaders BillCriswell gave me last night? it lost me at 'You need to add the appropriate number of <div>s'
[11:41:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:41:32] <robertmaxrees> no clue what you're talking about, Kartagis, but sure.  the room could help.
[11:42:36] <Kartagis> https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/loaders.css
[11:42:59] <Kartagis> I thought you might be familiar with it
[11:43:10] <robertmaxrees> with what?
[11:43:12] <robertmaxrees> the project?
[11:43:24] <robertmaxrees> (some context would be helpful ;) )
[11:49:48] <Kartagis> what I'm trying to do is use any of them. I created a div with one of the classes and thought it might automatically be styled
[11:50:23] <Kartagis> sorry for the delay btw, kid slipped and almost hit her head
[11:50:31] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to add an ajax spinner to something?
[11:50:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why this requires an entire library.
[11:51:23] <Kartagis> it shouldn't really. I'm just trying to use an ajax spinner
[11:51:31] <robertmaxrees> sooo then what are you lost on?
[11:52:25] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/x801p64a/1/ <--- I've got this but I need something different
[11:52:36] <robertmaxrees> what do you need different?
[11:54:35] <Kartagis> http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/ something like
[11:54:47] <robertmaxrees> okay back up - what are you specifically confused about?
[11:54:49] <Kartagis> I don't want an image though
[11:54:51] <robertmaxrees> like - we're not going to do it for you.
[11:55:05] <robertmaxrees> because this is really trivial.
[11:55:06] <Kartagis> okay I understand that
[11:55:29] <Kartagis> I'm confused about what BillCriswell gave me
[11:55:38] <robertmaxrees> okay - show me what he gave you?
[11:55:45] <robertmaxrees> what specifically about it is confusing?
[11:57:54] <absk007> The jQuery return a collection of matched elements either found in the DOM based on passed argument(s) or created by passing an HTML string. How to get the second element of the collection? Is it the jQuery object that's returned while getting the second element or the DOM ELEMENT?
[11:58:09] <absk007> s/jQuery/jQuery()
[11:58:11] <robertmaxrees> .get()
[11:58:13] <robertmaxrees> or .eq()
[11:58:26] <absk007> robertmaxrees, .get() gives out DOM ELEMENT
[11:58:32] <robertmaxrees> so use .eq()
[12:01:15] <Kartagis> https://connoratherton.com/loaders
[12:01:24] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis that's not helpful.
[12:01:29] <robertmaxrees> what can i do to help you get this done?
[12:02:09] <Kartagis> https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/loaders.css#usage I'm lost at this
[12:02:27] <robertmaxrees> okay.  why?
[12:03:41] <vacho> robertmaxrees: that was very helpful!
[12:03:47] <vacho> robertmaxrees: thanks again
[12:04:07] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis https://connoratherton.com/loaders - inspect a loader.
[12:04:13] <robertmaxrees> pretty clear what you need to do.
[12:04:51] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/pj7of2g2/ <--- I tried to use like this and it didn't do its thing
[12:05:01] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:05:07] <robertmaxrees> inspect the sample page and it'll show you what you need.
[12:05:32] <Kartagis> oh
[12:05:40] <Kartagis> I see clearly now
[12:05:45] <Kartagis> thanks
[12:13:13] <Kartagis> at last
[12:13:38] <Kartagis> I must really learn to read, not only glimpse
[12:15:23] <cordovafan8> Is there a way to make simultaneous (or near simultaneous) ajax requests use the same connection (for keep-alive/ssl)?
[12:15:31] <cordovafan8> My understanding is that there isn't
[12:15:39] <cordovafan8> since the connections are separate
[12:15:55] <cordovafan8> but I want to avoid doing multiple ssl handshakes on ajax requests
[12:16:30] <robertmaxrees> afaik, no.  sounds like you need to auth first, and then allow the session to do its thing.
[12:20:32] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: is that standard behavior for ajax applications? I've never seen anything like that
[12:20:40] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[12:21:03] <robertmaxrees> could you maybe explain the problem you're trying to solve?
[12:21:09] <robertmaxrees> the simultaneous bit seems strange.
[12:24:23] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: My issue is one of performance. When I look at the ajax calls I need to make on a given page load, I see that the "ssl connection" takes 100ms or more on mobile for each ajax request. I'd like to eliminate that if possible and somehow route all subsequent connections through that one thread, but without losing the ability to make concurrent requests.
[12:24:38] <robertmaxrees> so there aren't multiple threads.
[12:24:57] <cordovafan8> Pretty sure that's impossible, because the nature of making async ajax requests is that they use their own connection thread, but I thought I should ask
[12:25:14] <robertmaxrees> there's no "thread" as far as JS is concerned.
[12:25:14] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:25:34] <robertmaxrees> it's single-threaded.  you're trying to kill the SSL overhead, which is sensible.
[12:25:40] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: well there are multiple asynchronous ajax requests being made at the same time. I'm not sure if that qualifies as multiple threads, but I assumed it did?
[12:25:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:25:48] <robertmaxrees> that's not a thread.
[12:25:54] <robertmaxrees> those are just async requests.
[12:26:15] <cordovafan8> ok, well that's good news then. I should be able to enable Keep-Alive on the server and see less ssl overhead?
[12:26:38] <robertmaxrees> http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/ssl-latency.html for some info.
[12:26:45] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about how these things work.
[12:27:31] <cordovafan8> I have that open in another tab already heh, but apparently I didn't absorb it correctly
[12:28:01] <robertmaxrees> so you mentioned 100ms per request - how many are you making per page?
[12:28:08] <robertmaxrees> what sorts of loadtimes are you experiencing?
[12:30:37] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: I'm making maybe 5 per page, the load times are ok, maybe a few hundred ms total on average. But it seems to me that a lot of that is ssl overhead.
[12:30:45] <Jeff__> can someone help me fix my syntax: https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/9d82bb9e7e438d7d3b07374e374d73ab4a4377c1/package.json#L6
[12:30:54] <robertmaxrees> because SSL incurs a lot of overhead, cordovafan8 :)
[12:31:06] <Jeff__> I get: Error: can't read file: /src/js/*.jx
[12:31:10] <robertmaxrees> Jeff__ i'd ask in ##javascript or #Node.js
[12:32:48] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: so it seems. :) I'm looking at tuning it up, but I am new at this
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> so it's not creating a performance issue yet?
[12:35:17] <sveinse> I am an ultimate n00b in jquery: $("#some") seems to select only one instance (first?) of the object? How can I iterate over all instances?
[12:36:59] <cluelessperson> hey guys, I'm trying to post data to an HTTP site from an HTTPS browser session
[12:37:05] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: well I think it might be, but I'm not sure really. I've spent the last several weeks tuning db queries and backend stuff, and I'm not seeing the performance I hoped for is all, so I'm looking for scapegoats.
[12:37:08] <cluelessperson> how can I do this and avoid the security errors?
[12:38:37] <cluelessperson> this here.  https://cluelessperson.com/MPC/
[12:42:53] <robertmaxrees> sveinse you can only hav an ID once per page.
[12:43:15] <robertmaxrees> sveinse need to use classes.
[12:44:53] <sveinse> robertmaxrees: thanks. perfect
[12:52:31] <cluelessperson> anyone?
[12:52:48] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson what exactly are you trying to do?
[12:53:07] <robertmaxrees> oh i see the code.
[12:53:09] <robertmaxrees> that's CORS.
[12:53:54] <robertmaxrees> http://192.168.0.253/ needs to allow cross-domain requests, but even then you'll have issues because the main page is on HTTPS and the browser will complain until they're both NOT on https/.
[12:54:00] <robertmaxrees> or they both are on https
[12:54:36] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, 192.168.0.253 is a MPC on my desktop.  the plan is for a later media server for a tv or something
[12:54:46] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson that is completely irrelevant ot the issue :)
[12:54:52] <robertmaxrees> it's a CORS and mixed security issue.
[12:55:00] <robertmaxrees> you need to resolve both,
[12:55:27] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, I might be able to submit to php, and have the php then submit to http. >.<
[12:55:31] <cluelessperson> relay of sorts
[12:55:36] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson you could proxy like that.
[12:55:42] <robertmaxrees> but why do you need one to be on https?
[12:56:00] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, my web server is configured to force all https only

[13:46:16] <cluelessperson> question, how do you parse html that you just loaded?
[13:46:56] <cluelessperson> I need to get the <i id="position">01:02:00</i>  from this html
[13:48:44] <cluelessperson> I mean like.  $.get(url)
[13:49:39] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson how are you loading it?
[13:49:59] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, the variable data contains html, I need to parse it for variables.
[13:50:07] <robertmaxrees> wat.
[13:50:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:50:28] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, the variable "data"  contains raw html, I need to parse it to gather variables..
[13:50:43] <robertmaxrees> .get('someurl.com').done(function(data) { $(data).find('#someStuff'); });
[13:51:19] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, excellent!
[13:51:22] <cluelessperson> brb
[13:51:31] <robertmaxrees> passing a string of html to $() generates a jquery object of tht markup

[15:37:55] <basiclaser> how can i detect whether or not an element contains a child element with a certain class?
[15:38:11] <basiclaser> i have this, but it always evaluates to true
[15:38:15] <basiclaser> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/WRYgefsA/
[15:38:30] <robertmaxrees> .find().length
[15:38:45] <robertmaxrees>  $(this).find(".panel-footer") returns a jquery object always, even if there are no matches.

[15:48:50] <basiclaser> good ol .lengh
[17:35:28] <snow_wons> hello, I have problem with jquery & bootstrap. I can not tell exactly where is the problem, can anybody help me with the bootstrap/jquery tabs please?
[22:07:54] <lenswipee> hey, is there a way to trigger an ajax callback function on the server-side?
[22:13:05] <mdev> lens not that i'm aware of, unless client is long ajax polling, what you can do though is a few things
[22:13:18] <mdev> the easiest/cleanest/fastest/nicest is just use websockets, namely socket.io
[22:13:27] <mdev> then can bidirectional talk back and forth smoothly
[22:13:36] <mdev> there's all serversource events
[22:13:52] <mdev> that you can call via javascript, where server pushes events, you can't talk to it though directly
[22:14:14] <mdev> http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_serversentevents.asp
[22:14:58] <lenswipee> mdev: I assume if you're using < html5 if you have download websockets seperately.
[22:16:20] <lenswipee> mdev: I think the easiest way would be to copy the existing ajax call back function for server use directly.
[22:16:53] <mdev> not sure what that means, but if that's what you wanna do, go for it :)
[22:17:10] <mdev> socket.io though is seriously awesome, it supports many transports including long ajax polling
[22:17:17] <mdev> so works everywhere, mobile etc...
[22:17:27] <mdev> example of real-time stats I made with it
[22:17:41] <mdev> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50354233/dashstats.png
[22:18:01] <lenswipee> mdev: I got say function my_ajax_callback(){..} that i want to call directly from server-side.
[22:18:27] <mdev> I don't think you can really do
[22:18:29] <mdev> that*
[22:18:51] <lenswipee> mdev: I could just make a copy of the same function with some minor changes.
[22:20:05] <lenswipee> mdev: yeah i'll definately look into websockets
[22:22:16] <mdev> look into socket.io specifically
[22:22:26] <mdev> it's websockets but done very well and added features
[22:22:44] <mdev> and is mature and used quite often, plus easy to use in javascript and with node.js server side
[22:29:10] <lenswipee> i'm confused with all the terminology and what they all do and how they all connect. that is websockets, node.js. socket.io...
[22:38:31] <rcyr> lenswipee: Websockets: A way to do bidirectional communication in realtime between a server and browser
[22:39:00] <rcyr> lenswipee: Node.JS: A JS interpreter and a ton of libraries to do server-side JS applications
[22:39:53] <lenswipee> rcyr: why you need both?
[22:39:54] <rcyr> Socket.io, I library to do realtime communication between a server and a browser using a websockets for browsers that support them... or fallbacks for others (flash/silverlight/iframes/etc)
[22:40:28] <rcyr> You can do websockets with any server-side technology... it's just that node is popular for that these days.
[22:41:08] <lenswipee> rcyr: so you could use PHP and socket.io?
[22:41:36] <rcyr> Yup.. but it's not a popular way to do it because of PHP's classic request/response scope.
[22:42:05] <rcyr> lenswipee: If you really want to do websockets with PHP, you can use http://socketo.me/
[22:43:04] <lenswipee> rcyr: but it will work just the same or is it limited in some way?
[22:43:20] <rcyr> Should work the same.
[22:50:46] <lenswipee> rcyr: one less technology to learn
[22:51:22] <rcyr> lenswipee: NodeJS is just a way for frontend devs to start doing backend stuff.
[22:51:58] <rcyr> I don't personally know any "pure backend" who would touch nodejs without a stick.
[22:52:16] <rcyr> There are so many language alternatives on the backend
[22:57:16] <lenswipee> I'm wondering why node.js is so popular then. alot of frontend developers who don't know PHP ...
[22:59:55] <rcyr> lenswipee: I don't even like PHP... I just write it when asked to (My current title at my job is "Senior PHP Developer")
[23:00:20] <rcyr> But you know... languages are just tools.
[23:05:32] <lenswipee> rcyr: You do what you gotta do to pay the bills.
[23:06:45] <lenswipee> rcyr: What you think of project managers with little IT background running IT projects and cannot write a line of code, but obviously can talk the talk... that's how they got the job in the first place?
[23:07:41] <rcyr> Projects managers don't really _need_ to be highly technical but they need to trust their devs and have excellent organizational skills.
[23:07:57] <rcyr> Most PMs are incompetent though...
[23:08:01] <rcyr> Kind of sad.
[23:08:53] <jak2000> hi all friend, jbox is a good plugin for modal window?
[23:15:01] <acidjazz> is it possible to do something like.. ovveride $.get.fail() so that it always does something by default if i dont specify it?
[23:49:23] <lenswipee> websockets are built into PHP right?
[23:51:52] <rcyr> No but you can get a library
[23:56:02] <jak2000> rcyr you worked with jBox?
[23:56:07] <rcyr> No, never
[23:58:55] <jak2000> wich Modal Window recommend m? (i want put here 3 inputs and 2 buttons)
