[00:10:51] <morenoh11> how might I keep track of the screen focused with the url?
[00:11:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[00:11:22] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean track which div is showing?
[00:11:42] <morenoh11> I know some sites add /#/tabname and parse that on load to show the right screen on the page
[00:11:59] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "screen"?
[00:24:37] <morenoh11> lets extend your example, update the url with some text. When the page loads it should read the url for the proper div to display.
[00:25:26] <robertmaxrees> fwiw when you say "screen" that implies the actual screen of the computer.
[00:25:29] <robertmaxrees> so that's not too hard.
[00:26:10] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/hash
[00:27:26] <robertmaxrees> woops - you want window.location.hash
[00:27:30] <robertmaxrees> both setting and reading.
[00:42:02] <morenoh11> robertmaxrees: ok I got something started. thanks
[08:29:58] <TomyWork> can i somehow tell jquery to submit an actual <form> with that form's current values, parse the result as json and return the result?
[08:30:56] <Cork> you can convert a form to params and ajax submit it
[08:31:02] <Cork> and if the server returns json you will get it
[08:31:22] <Cork> or you can submit the form and the server rendering does the rest
[08:31:34] <Cork> but you can't convert a server response to json
[08:33:11] <TomyWork> Cork, so there's nothing to do that first step for me?
[08:33:32] <Cork> TomyWork: depends on what you mean
[08:33:45] <TomyWork> well i dont want to write so much code :)
[08:34:47] <Cork> you can use .serialize() or serializeArray() to give form values to an ajax call, if that is what you ask for
[08:35:00] <Cork> but "submit a form" is very generic and can be done in multiple ways
[08:35:06] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:35:23] <TomyWork> the method is GET, if that helps
[08:35:45] <Cork> that is just the verb, and no that doesn't matter much
[08:35:52] <Cork> how you want to submit it is what matters
[08:36:02] <TomyWork> but it means that each form element is sent as a parameter
[08:36:04] <Cork> or rather what the server requires
[08:36:18] <Cork> so does POST and PATCH
[08:36:26] <Cork> it just puts the parameters in the body instead
[08:36:27] <TomyWork> query parameter
[08:36:33] <TomyWork> not in the body
[08:36:47] <Cork> ya, but that is exactly the same content, just in different places
[08:37:21] <Cork> how you submit is if you use $.ajax, or native http request or another lib or xhr directly or...
[08:37:28] <Cork> you haven't specified that at all
[08:37:49] <Cork> heck even jsonp is possible
[08:38:14] <TomyWork> i'm just talking about the request, not the response
[08:38:25] <Cork> the is the request...
[08:38:35] <TomyWork> i currently do response parsing with $.getJSON
[08:38:41] <TomyWork> jsonp in the request?
[08:38:48] <Cork> yes
[08:38:51] <TomyWork> eww
[08:38:57] <Cork> it makes a request using <script> tag
[08:39:16] <Cork> to allow requests to third party servers without cors headers
[08:39:50] <Cork> anyway for form parsing i gave you the command you want
[08:39:54] <TomyWork> serialize looks good
[11:01:18] <tona> hello everyone, how could I init a wdget in jquery
