[00:00:49] <Kartagis> wut? I still get Unexpected token <
[00:01:52] <Kartagis> jquery.js line #612
[00:02:11] <Cork> Kartagis: anyway to reproduce the problem?
[00:02:27] <Kartagis> Cork: please go to http://html.webcinizim.com/rejicast/www/ and click on "TÃ¼m Oyuncular"
[00:02:52] <Kartagis> and don't worry about cordova.js
[00:03:14] <Cork> well all i get there is the error from the jsparser trying to execute <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
[00:03:25] <Cork> from... /rejicast/www/cordova.j
[00:03:27] <Cork> +s
[00:03:49] <Cork> so if i ignore that i don't get any error
[00:04:38] <Cork> and wow... a server that uses html 2.0 error pages...
[00:04:55] <Kartagis> did you click on TÃ¼m Oyuncular?
[00:04:59] <Cork> yes
[00:05:20] <Cork> and that is when i get that error
[00:05:26] <Kartagis> wait, let me try to record my screen
[00:06:06] <Cork> tüm oyuncular loads listing.html, listing.html loads cordova.js, cordova.js is html so the jsparser fails to execute it
[00:07:44] <Cork> ah, ya chrome is a big more cryptic in the error stack
[00:08:07] <Cork> cause it does't point to the data executed in globalEval
[00:08:20] <Cork> it instead points at globalEval in jquery
[00:08:31] <Kartagis> Cork: http://videobin.org/+9o5/cvi.html
[00:08:58] <Cork> Kartagis: create cordova.js as an empty file and the error will go away
[00:09:21] <Uhkis> Cork: apply.js line 10 is 2004 chars long
[00:09:36] <Cork> Kartagis: and this is why you should NEVER ignore errors
[00:10:04] <Cork> as they will skew your search for the problem
[00:10:17] <Uhkis> maybe it's dynamically created?
[00:10:25] <Kartagis> Cork: cordova.js not existing is not an error. it is added on runtime
[00:10:25] <Cork> no
[00:10:39] <Cork> Kartagis: well you still need to provide it
[00:10:54] <Cork> cause the error you see comes from the html the server sends and jqeury tries to execute
[00:11:18] <Kartagis> ls platforms/android/platform_www/
[00:11:19] <Kartagis> cordova.js  cordova-js-src
[00:11:57] <Cork> Kartagis: http://html.webcinizim.com/rejicast/www/cordova.js still not there
[00:12:22] <Cork> that request has to return something that isn't invalid js if you want to not get that error
[00:12:58] <Kartagis> I'm telling you, it's not an error. this is supposed to happen. that's the way cordova works
[00:13:16] <Cork> ok, fine then you are suppose to get the exception you're seeing
[00:13:19] <Cork> cause it is expected
[00:13:34] <Cork> js can't execute <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
[00:13:36] <Cork> it isn't valid js
[00:15:53] <Kartagis> Cork: where are you seeing that it returns that?
[00:16:03] <Kartagis> I'm not seeing that either
[00:17:31] <Uhkis> Kartagis: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 read and learn
[01:04:05] <NikoZz> hi there. I am looking for a js library for image cropping and uploading. any suggestions?
[01:56:58] <km4> hi, can i get some help in this # ? or join another?
[01:57:41] <Cork> uh "this"?
[01:57:57] <Cork> just ask the question, don't ask to ask
[01:59:15] * Kartagis sings "I'm going slightly mad"
[02:02:16] <km4> ok I use getJSON and if use console.log(data) I got arry [Object, Object, etc.] what i need do to take some information of this arry? for example console.log(data.name) ? sorry for my language
[02:02:59] <Cork> km4: $.each(data, function(elm) { elm.name })
[02:16:55] <km4> Cork: thnx ;)
[02:28:37] <Utils> You can do $("<div />").appendsTo(".div"), but is there a function that will replace wha's in ".div"?
[02:28:49] <Utils> Or do I have to do $(".div").html(...)?
[02:29:15] <Cork> the later
[02:29:20] <Utils> ok.
[02:29:43] <Cork> and appendsTo actually do the same thing
[02:29:56] <Cork> $('.div').append($('<div>')
[02:29:57] <Cork> )
[02:30:03] <bongjovi> I'm using jQuery UI with core.js, widget.js, datepicker.js, effect.js, but still getting easing errors
[02:30:29] <bongjovi> using .animate with 'ease'
[02:30:36] <Utils> yeah I'm aware. Was just hoping that there was like a one liner solution as I'm already doing var $div = $("<div />"), but no worries.
[02:30:51] <bongjovi> ah, ease =  swing?
[02:31:19] <Cork> bongjovi: core only provides a few effects
[02:31:31] <Cork> or rather jquery only includes a few effects
[02:31:38] <bongjovi> i see that 'ease' isn't used, makes sense
[02:31:39] <Cork> the full jquery ui provides a lot more
[02:32:08] <bongjovi> i'm assuming jQuery UI 'swing' is the same as css 'ease'
[02:32:31] <Cork> not fully no
[02:33:29] <Cork> bongjovi: compare http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/ to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions
[02:33:39] <bongjovi> thanks
[02:35:26] <Cork> bongjovi: hmm sorry, swing does actually look the same
[02:35:38] <Cork> wasn't called that last i used js effects >_>
[02:35:45] <Cork> but that was quite a while a go
[02:37:04] <bongjovi> hmm, this sheds some light http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9245030/looking-for-a-swing-like-easing-expressible-both-with-jquery-and-css3
[04:05:30] <Kartagis> Cork: I nailed the problem. it was because I was src'ing cordova.js twice
[04:45:56] <Utils> Not sure what this issue is related to but I'm making a custom file upload field and so far I have a browse button that opens the file dialog. The problem here is that the dialog ($("input[type=file]").click()) is full screen and I can't drag or resize it.
[04:46:00] <Utils> What could be causing that?
[04:46:22] <Utils> It's simply a button with a click listener, that clicks the file input field. Nothing too complex.
[04:47:17] <Utils> Nevermind... I double clicked the title bar. ;D
[05:16:29] <RafCity> anyone know how to fix issues with image overlays in IE 11 with SSL
[05:16:40] <RafCity> works fine without SSL, and on FF and Chrome, just not IE11
[05:17:48] <RafCity> image overlay like clicking Free Download on: https://www.avast.com/en-us/index
[05:17:59] <RafCity> screen dims, image pops up directing user to click the installer
[05:43:09] <kennydude> Hi, I'm having an issue manaully triggering events. I'm trying to call a change handler from some automated tests and it just isn't being called :/
[05:49:45] <Horacsio> hi why the italic doesnâ€™t work inside .text()? http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/g1r7fpL2/2/
[05:53:46] <Cork> Horacsio: cause you ask for the text...
[05:53:55] <Cork> so by definition you remove <i>
[05:54:15] <Cork> if you want to inject html use .html()
[05:54:29] <Cork> Horacsio: and when we're on the subject
[05:54:41] <Cork> you shouldn't use the text in the element as a rule for what the code should do
[05:55:00] <Cork> for example, if you ever want to translate the application based on the visitor things will blow up
[05:55:15] <Cork> Horacsio: so instead add the text in the html and toggle it with a class
[05:55:28] <Horacsio> Iâ€™m following :)
[05:55:39] <Horacsio> ok
[05:57:36] <Cork> Horacsio: http://jsfiddle.net/g1r7fpL2/4/
[05:57:40] <Cork> much cleaner :)
[05:59:12] <Horacsio> much cleaner :) thank you :)
[05:59:22] <Horacsio> Iâ€™ve cleaned the css too :)
[05:59:35] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/L2hhsjvj/1/
[05:59:51] <Cork> Horacsio: actually you could make the span be Show/Close only
[05:59:56] <Cork> as they are the same for the rest
[06:00:49] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/g1r7fpL2/5/
[06:03:23] <Horacsio> interesting :) thank you very much for help
[06:03:29] <Cork> np
[06:09:28] <xde> hi, i need help for selector in jquery :) http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=INR96T0ab6
[06:15:33] <Lebbe> I made a pseudo selector, let us call it ':property(someProperty)'. I want to listen on changes on this element. i know it is an input element so I can do one of two things
[06:16:07] <Lebbe> $('input:property(someProperty)').change runs the function defining the pseudo property for all input elements in DOM
[06:16:35] <Lebbe> since I perhaps want lots of listeners and have lots of input elements (101) I do
[06:17:08] <Lebbe> $('body').on('change', 'input:propert(someProperty)', function() {...})
[06:17:27] <Cork> Lebbe: you should delegate the event listener, but you should avoid js functions in those selectors
[06:17:36] <Cork> cause they will run a lot
[06:17:40] <Lebbe> but then when something changes the change event climbs the DOM tree
[06:17:52] <Lebbe> and the pseudo selector is run for elements that is NOT input elements?
[06:17:55] <Cork> also $(document) is normally a better choice then $('body')
[06:18:04] <Lebbe> thanks
[06:18:07] <Lebbe> but either way
[06:18:24] <Lebbe> why run pseudo selector when we allready know the element is not an input element?
[06:18:24] <Cork> Lebbe: sizzle process the selector first
[06:18:36] <Lebbe> not on DOM climbing it seems
[06:18:37] <Cork> build and array and if that array has any elements your selector are run
[06:19:13] <Cork> so ya, it shouldn't run on none input element
[06:19:22] <Lebbe> oh but it does
[06:19:29] <Lebbe> that is what is so weird
[06:19:36] <Cork> hmm what version of jquery?
[06:19:54] <Lebbe> 2.1.3
[06:19:57] <Cork> i haven't read this part of the code in quite a while so it could have changed
[06:20:20] <Lebbe> it doesnt run on input elements when i do $('input:property(someProperty)')
[06:20:28] <Lebbe> negate that :P
[06:20:42] <Lebbe> it doesnt run on non-input-elements!!!
[06:21:01] <Lebbe> but $(document).on('change', 'input:propert(someProperty)', function() {...}) runs on non-input elements
[06:21:05] <Cork> what's the name of the object you decalre custom psudo methods on again?
[06:21:22] <Lebbe> $.expr.pseudo
[06:21:29] <Cork> ah, right expr
[06:21:39] <Lebbe> pseudos*
[06:22:13] <Lebbe> let me jsfiddle it
[06:26:59] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/r59uec5m/
[06:28:03] <Lebbe> I know there is a new way to define pseudos in sizzle, btw :)
[06:28:57] <Lebbe> if you make a change you see that the some[]property pseudo selector fires five times
[06:29:11] <Lebbe> as many times as DOM-elements climbing to the form
[06:29:32] <Lebbe> even if the other elements are DIV and FORM, not INPUT
[06:30:14] <Lebbe> while the other[].property pseudo-selector are only run four times
[06:31:06] <Lebbe> seems unefficient
[06:31:20] <Lebbe> and weird
[06:32:15] <Lebbe> oh
[06:32:24] <Lebbe> some[].property are run seven times it seems
[06:32:26] <Lebbe> not five
[06:32:32] <Lebbe> god knows why
[06:32:49] <Lebbe> perhaps there are a form higher up in the jsfiddle DOM tree or something
[06:34:30] <Lebbe> oh my god
[06:34:37] <Lebbe> it is climbing all the way to <html>?
[06:34:53] <Lebbe> why is it running the pseudo-selector above <form>?
[06:35:03] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/r59uec5m/1/
[06:35:22] <Lebbe> oh sorry
[06:35:22] <Lebbe> haha
[06:35:38] <Lebbe> http://jsfiddle.net/lebbe/r59uec5m/2/
[06:35:44] <Lebbe> i used document not form :P
[06:35:46] <Lebbe> but either way
[06:35:58] <Lebbe> why is it using pseudo-selector when the element is not an input element?
[06:37:15] <xde> an idea ? :) http://jsfiddle.net/#run&togetherjs=i3p3N5eI9B
[06:38:06] <RafCity> anyone know how to fix issue with image overlay not rendering in IE 11 with SSL enabled works fine without SSL, and with SSL in FF and Chrome, just not IE11
[06:38:33] <RafCity> image overlay like clicking Freescreen dims, image pops up directing user to click the installer Download on: https://www.avast.com/en-us/index while using chrome or FF
[06:40:32] <Cork> RafCity: are the image loaded from https too?
[06:41:10] <Cork> cause https should only matter as long as you aren't loading some of it over http
[06:41:24] <Cork> uh...
[06:41:36] <Cork> cause https should only matter if you load some of it over http
[06:41:40] <Cork> there, much better :)
[06:44:02] <RafCity> yes
[06:44:15] <RafCity> @voyage_
[06:44:30] <Cork> RafCity: https shouldn't matter in that case
[06:45:07] <RafCity> i didnt think so either, works fine in IE
[06:45:28] <Cork> uh, you said you had the problem with ie...
[06:45:38] <RafCity> working here (http): http://secureapp.trackoff.com/lp.html
[06:45:53] <aro> when i try to write a json object to a div, it puts it as [object Object]
[06:45:54] <RafCity> not working here (https): https://trackoff.com/lp.html
[06:46:00] <aro> how do i print it as string with linebreaks?
[06:46:01] <RafCity> when you click download...
[06:46:05] <xde> an idea ? :) http://jsfiddle.net/#run&togetherjs=i3p3N5eI9B
[06:46:19] <Cork> aro: you can't print objects you would have to stringify it to json
[06:46:27] <Cork> JSON.stringify(object)
[06:46:30] <aro> i did stringify it but it prints it all in one line
[06:46:43] <aro> i want to preserve the linebreaks i get back from the server
[06:46:56] <Cork> if you want to pretty print it you would have to grab something that does that
[06:47:06] <aro> thats how it comes back from the server
[06:47:11] <Cork> json normally doesn't have linebreaks
[06:47:15] <RafCity> sorry, working here: http://secureapp.trackoff.com/stop-tracking.html
[06:47:28] <Cork> well it gets parsed into javascript objects and arrays
[06:47:35] <Cork> and then the line breaks are gone
[06:47:55] <Cork> aro: if you want to inspect the response from the server check the network tab
[06:49:18] <Lebbe> Cork: if I want to report my finding as a bug (sizzle using pseudo-selector on DOM-climbing but not on querying) where should i go?
[06:49:25] <aro> i got it working
[06:49:28] <Lebbe> the sizzle github project?
[06:50:01] <aro> COrk
[06:50:08] <Cork> Lebbe: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle
[06:50:17] <aro> JSON.stringify takes extra args for indenting and formatting
[06:50:26] <Lebbe> thanks
[06:50:44] <Cork> Lebbe: though the issue might be invalid cause it might be a necessity to get things to work
[06:50:56] <Lebbe> it might
[06:51:13] <Lebbe> but how can it work on querying and not on climbing?
[06:51:35] <Lebbe> I tried to read the sizzle-code, but that was very comples for my brain :)
[06:51:35] <Cork> bubbling, or delegated
[06:51:38] <Cork> not climbing :)
[06:51:42] <Lebbe> okay
[06:51:44] <Lebbe> thanks!
[06:52:14] <Cork> well delegate checks if event.target exists inside the selector
[06:52:29] <Cork> so it will select all elements matching the selector and then check if event.target matches
[06:52:39] <Cork> ... i just answered why didn't i...
[06:52:40] <Cork> XD
[06:53:35] <xde> an idea ? :) http://jsfiddle.net/#run&togetherjs=i3p3N5eI9B
[06:55:30] <Lebbe> but when checking if element x matches selector 'input:pseudo()' why does it run the pseudo selector on the element on event bubbling, but not on querrying?
[06:55:51] <Cork> Lebbe: cause it selects all elements matching 'input:pseudo()'
[06:56:09] <Cork> so no matter where it comes from it will select them all
[06:57:04] <Lebbe> but when selecting elements matching 'input:pseudo()' why does it run the function defining the pseudo selector on elements that are not input-elements?
[06:57:20] <Lebbe> on event-bubbling but not qhen querrying?
[06:57:26] <Lebbe> when*
[06:58:08] <Cork> ok, i'll have to dig a little bit more
[06:58:15] <Cork> i might not have time to find where this happen though
[06:58:30] <Cork> but to give you a hint you need to check into jquery.event.add
[06:58:45] <Cork> and where it does the work for checking the selector for delegated events
[06:58:59] <Cork> that is where you will find why this works the way it does, not in sizzle
[06:59:42] <Lebbe> ah!
[06:59:45] <Lebbe> thank you!
[07:20:49] <dominic1134> hi, dunno if it fits here. i'm using this library https://github.com/1000hz/bootstrap-validator/blob/master/dist/validator.js#L219 for form validation. i want to extend it in order to use it on other buttons than submit buttons as well. to achieve that i have basically added , input[data-validator="submit"]   in Lines 219, 221, 257  which should do it. i'm using my buttons like <button type="button"
[07:20:54] <dominic1134> data-validator="submit" ... >  but as soon as i add the data-validator data prop inside the validator.js,  somehow the buttons disappear
[07:20:57] <dominic1134> any clues?
[07:40:42] <taplar> should that be button[data-validator="submit"] ?
[07:41:11] <taplar> or is the tag you gave wrong?
[07:47:30] <rbennacer> hey guys, how can i select DOM elements that have the microdata itemscope ex <div itemscope class="something">...</div>
[07:50:05] <taplar> rbennacer: you can do $('[itemscope]') but it's probably better to have a more specific selector, such as if they all have the same class or same tag type to help reduce the dom scan
[07:50:33] <rbennacer> taplar: mm it makes sens

[07:54:37] <mRCUTEO> hi anyone knows how to send json array data to jquery?
[07:54:55] <mRCUTEO> i have tried using (#field).value() but wotn work
[07:55:20] <taplar> what do you mean json array data
[07:55:21] <mRCUTEO> it only takes one value but i what i want is jquery to handle array
[07:55:33] <mRCUTEO> hi taplar nice to see you again
[07:55:47] <taplar> happy friday, :)
[07:55:47] <mRCUTEO> i have this:
[07:55:54] <mRCUTEO> u too my good friend
[07:56:00] <mRCUTEO> while($rowcheckz = mysqli_fetch_array($groupcheck)){     $list[] = $rowcheckz['System_Origin'];
[07:56:13] <mRCUTEO> echo json_encode($list);
[07:56:20] <mRCUTEO> then i use jquery to get the data
[07:56:40] <mRCUTEO>  $('#Sender_District').val(result['Sender_District']);
[07:57:00] <mRCUTEO> the while should produce an array
[07:57:24] <mRCUTEO> and the array will be pass to a multichoise listbox in a form using jquery
[07:57:48] <taplar> what do you get if you do console.log( result ); ?
[07:58:39] <mRCUTEO> i got 2 array value result ["L11","K11"]
[07:59:15] <mRCUTEO> but when i pass this value to $('#Sender_District').val(result['Sender_District']); it only choose and select L11 in the multi choise listbox in the form
[07:59:19] <taplar> does the console say Object ..... or String ...
[08:00:20] <taplar> or Array ...
[08:01:36] <mRCUTEO> it shows array
[08:01:48] <taplar> ok, in that case your not going to be able to look up by key
[08:02:05] <taplar> if you want to do that, your going to have to make the array you encode in the php be an associative array
[08:03:00] <mRCUTEO> ic
[08:03:16] <mRCUTEO> turn the result to array in php?
[08:04:03] <taplar> um, something like $result['System_Origin'] = $rowcheckz['System_Origin'] i think
[08:04:27] <taplar> i know if your creating one from scratch it's like array( 'key1' => 'value1' )
[08:05:16] <mRCUTEO> ok i understand now thanks :)
[08:05:42] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3206020/push-item-to-associative-array-in-php

[08:11:03] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[08:11:23] <taplar> nvm, i see the comment
[08:18:06] <taplar> you have to put the trs in a table
[08:18:13] <taplar> without the table it's not finding the elements
[08:22:34] <mRCUTEO> taplar thanks for the help i got it working already :)
[08:22:44] <mRCUTEO> thanks for the resources :)
[08:23:21] <taplar> good deal

[08:27:21] <nanexcool80> Weird thing going on... I enabled mod_pagespeed on Apache, and now if I return any html after an AJAX call, it adds a <head/> tag to the beginning of the response. When I return a table row <tr><td>Data</td></tr> it prepends a <head/> to it, and when I do a $('#myTable > tbody:first').append(data) it appends only the text and not the <tr> or <td> tags
[08:27:43] <nanexcool80> If I do $('#myTable > tbody:first').html(data) it works fine... any ideas?

[08:52:42] <alldayevery> not sure why i couldnt
[09:03:16] <taplar> don't see why you couldn't
[09:03:27] <taplar> unless the selector doesn't find any matches
[09:04:45] <taplar> ood'gay ay'day obbert'ray axress'may
[09:05:20] <obert> obbert?
[09:05:26] <taplar> woah
[09:05:36] <obert> :)
[09:06:44] <taplar> i need to look up more versions of hello
[09:29:10] <nol> hi i need help , https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=ffHwHn5NSy
[09:40:00] <nol> no idea ? https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=ffHwHn5NSy
[09:41:20] <taplar> nol: i answered you earlier.  you have to surround your trs with a table tag
[09:41:29] <taplar> otherwise it's not finding them with your selector
[09:41:58] <nol> i lost the page :/
[09:44:05] <nol> thx
[10:06:06] <taplar> that jsfiddle collaborate ability is pretty cool
[10:10:04] <onr> in real-time?
[10:10:10] <taplar> yep
[10:10:10] <robertmaxrees> it's cool in some cases, but i always found it really distracting.
[10:15:44] <DelphiWorld> hi all
[10:16:09] <DelphiWorld> whenever i define a audio or video source and open it on iOS i got full screen player, is there a way to let it half?
[10:28:20] <DelphiWorld> anyone?
[10:29:17] <robertmaxrees> you want fullscreen to only take up half the screen?>
[10:29:43] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure you can't do that since it's a separate app - would need to embed the video instead.
[10:29:52] <DelphiWorld> nope
[10:29:59] <DelphiWorld> if i embed the video in a page
[10:30:08] <DelphiWorld> normaly it shouldn't take full screen if i dont click fullscreen
[10:30:14] <DelphiWorld> i want to be able to browse & nav
[10:30:33] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to build a video player webapp kind of deal.
[10:30:54] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: video.js allready in-use, not enough? mmmmmm
[10:31:13] <robertmaxrees> then why are things opening fullscreen?
[10:31:25] <robertmaxrees> does ios not allow you to watch videos while embedded?
[10:31:34] <DelphiWorld> that's the fucking problem dude
[10:31:41] <DelphiWorld> only on iPhone
[10:31:46] <robertmaxrees> woah - no need to get angry at me.
[10:31:48] <DelphiWorld> no video and no audio, always full screen
[10:32:00] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: not at you buddy, but at apple
[10:32:23] <robertmaxrees> does youtube act the same way on pages?
[10:32:31] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: nope
[10:33:59] <snover> pretty sure any link to youtube is hardcoded to open the youtube app
[10:34:08] <snover> on ios
[10:34:16] <DelphiWorld> snover: is it
[10:34:25] <DelphiWorld> Snakes-: but if no youtube, it'll work perfectly on safari
[10:40:29] <noahmg123> How can I mage a dropdown (like html select) where each option has a bg image
[10:40:53] <Uhkis> wave your magic wand
[10:41:09] <DelphiWorld> strange.
[10:46:06] <taplar> noahmg123: you'll have to use something like http://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/  .  standard html select elements don't support images I don't believe
[10:46:42] <noahmg123> taplar: thx
[10:53:57] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: if my video size is 320x240 should i specify it in the <video> tag?
[11:20:03] <Emn1ty> anyone know the syntax for setting the timeout using $.post and not $.ajax
[11:20:26] <robertmaxrees> $.post() uses $.ajax() under the hood - just convert to $.ajax() and call it a day :)
[11:21:13] <Emn1ty> blah, that's not the answer to my question but sure
[11:21:29] <taplar> or use version two, which pretty much just keeps you from having to give it the method type
[11:21:53] <onr> jquery 2?
[11:22:06] <taplar> jQuery.post( [settings ] )
[11:22:24] <robertmaxrees> taplar look at the version added for that ;)
[11:22:29] <taplar> instead of the 4 or so separate parameters
[11:22:45] <taplar> ah, what version are they using?
[11:22:52] <robertmaxrees> very likely not 3.
[11:22:57] <taplar> or wait, so that's not out yet?
[11:23:28] <robertmaxrees> Emn1ty let me rephrase my answer then: $.post() is a convenience method that exposes a smaller subset of options to you to make things easier for you.  you now want more granular control, so swapping to $.ajax() is a good call imo.
[11:23:38] <robertmaxrees> taplar it's in alpha or beta.
[11:23:45] <taplar> ah

[11:24:33] <django_> hey guys
[11:24:36] <django_> I have this: http://pastebin.com/3xe37Agc
[11:24:54] <django_> went i click on the button i want it to do stuff
[11:25:08] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[11:25:12] <django_> i tried: $('#cont-2').click
[11:25:14] <django_> didnt work
[11:25:20] <robertmaxrees> share a fiddle of that code.
[11:25:24] <django_> also: $('#cont-2 a')
[11:25:39] <django_> one sec
[11:25:48] <robertmaxrees> both of those should work, assuming your js was in a doc ready or after the markup.
[11:27:13] <django_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/0br9jh8k/
[11:27:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0br9jh8k/1/
[11:27:53] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[11:29:05] <django_> doesnt work
[11:29:31] <robertmaxrees> ('#cont-3 a,#cont-4 a').css({'opacity':'0.5'}); isn't valid
[11:29:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0br9jh8k/2/
[11:29:58] <django_> robertmaxrees: bahh guess what...
[11:30:04] <django_> i didnt have my .js linked
[11:30:12] <robertmaxrees> your code was still bad.
[11:30:17] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle is fixed ;)
[11:33:16] <django_> robertmaxrees: how come it was incorrect?
[11:33:25] <robertmaxrees> you were missing the $ in front of it.
[11:35:11] <django_> the click function
[11:35:13] <django_> doesnt work
[11:35:17] <robertmaxrees> mine does.
[11:35:25] <robertmaxrees> you need to preventDefault on the anchor's click.
[11:35:43] <django_> never used a function(e) before
[11:36:07] <robertmaxrees> that defines the event object jquery passes when it calls that function.
[12:09:45] <paulvd> hello, i am getting a 500 internal server error when I do an ajax call, http://pastebin.com/0B0csrZ9
[12:09:47] <paulvd> Wt..
[12:18:51] <midori-rus> Hello could anybody reccomend a method to make dragable rows at table with hierrarchy?
[12:19:12] <midori-rus> I want to sort categories in table with they own and parend child
[12:19:27] <NoiseEee> paulvd: i'm assuming the script is running at 'cardinal.findafacilitator.com' too/
[12:19:48] <NoiseEee> paulvd: only the backend server error logs know about why a 500 error was returned
[13:00:59] <Jayplex> Anybody home
[13:02:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:02:49] <robertmaxrees> almost 700 people ;)
[13:51:05] <SmashingX2> Im showing a popup and then the background (page) gets darker, so what I want to do is to avoid the user to scroll down or up only when the popup is open, is there any way to do this?
[13:54:59] <hydraidm801> if I have var thing in $(document).ready and later have var thing inside $.ajax will the ajax have the same scope? like will the var thing in document ready override it?
[15:08:33] <manfrin`laptop> hello everyone -- I'm trying to $.get some json, but it's hitting part-of-the-url/[object Object] -- but I am not passing it data
[15:08:34] <manfrin`laptop> https://gist.github.com/manfrin/4380ee10f58bbb243f05
[15:08:36] <manfrin`laptop> ^ code
[15:11:23] <shoky> manfrin`laptop are you sure the error is coming from that code and not from something else?
[15:11:32] <manfrin`laptop> only place I have a get
[15:12:23] <manfrin`laptop>  i am utterly perplexed by this
[15:12:28] <shoky> are you sure that's the code that's running :\ doesn't make any sense
[15:12:42] <nirakara> yeah
[15:12:44] <manfrin`laptop> yeah -- it's a tiny react app I just started making, this is the first bit I'm trying to wire up
[15:13:04] <amirite> stop lurking
[15:13:07] <amirite> lurkers
[15:13:40] <shoky> manfrin`laptop check the request in your browser's devtools network tab
[15:13:44] <manfrin`laptop> if it were appending it to the end, then it might be that I'm passing an object, but the fact that it's replacing part of hte url
[15:14:08] <manfrin`laptop> yeah
[15:14:11] <manfrin`laptop> only 1 connection
[15:14:40] <shoky> what's the "initiator" ?
[15:14:52] <manfrin`laptop> react componentWillLoad
[15:15:06] <manfrin`laptop> react sets itself up, sets up the component, then once the component loads it runs that
[15:15:15] <manfrin`laptop> which simply calls fetchData (the code I showed)
[15:15:18] <manfrin`laptop> I'll gist the rest, 1 sec
[15:15:35] <shoky> i meant the initiator in the network tab (at least chrome has such a column)
[15:15:42] <shoky> but a gist is good
[15:15:53] <manfrin`laptop> updated, refresh or click: https://gist.github.com/manfrin/4380ee10f58bbb243f05
[15:16:24] <manfrin`laptop> not seeing an initiator :/
[15:16:30] <manfrin`laptop> (in the ui, i mean)
[15:18:24] <shoky> http://i.imgur.com/DAJJRiV.png  5th column here
[15:20:11] <shoky> anyways no idea
[15:20:19] <shoky> something else is going on..
[15:20:31] <manfrin`laptop> http://i.imgur.com/Z7LM5Au.png
[15:20:44] <shoky> ah
[15:21:50] <shoky> what jquery version is this btw
[15:22:12] <manfrin`laptop> lemme check
[15:22:45] <manfrin`laptop> not sure, it's bundled with toundation
[15:22:56] <robertmaxrees> do $.fn.jquery in your console
[15:23:03] <manfrin`laptop> calling .get directly in console returns the same thing, so something is up with my syntax or jquery is old
[15:23:05] <manfrin`laptop> kk, will do
[15:23:17] <manfrin`laptop> 2.1.4
[15:24:08] <hydraidm801> I have a string "09:00:00" how do I make it "9:00"?  i tried s ="09:00:00".split(':').pop().join(':') but I keep getting join is not a function
[15:24:32] <manfrin`laptop> pop() i think would return you the last element, so you're joining on a string
[15:25:20] <manfrin`laptop> shoky i moved the url outside the object, and made the object the 2nd element and it worked
[15:25:48] <manfrin`laptop> i think $.get({stuff}) is trying to get {stuff}, which is toString()ed as [object Object]
[15:26:00] <shoky> ohhh
[15:26:03] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't work.  you need to {stuff: stuff}
[15:26:13] <robertmaxrees> but you need a string for that.
[15:26:22] <shoky> ohhh
[15:26:31] <shoky> .get({stuff})  was only added in jquery 3 i see
[15:26:48] <robertmaxrees> $.post() has a similar new deal, too.
[15:26:49] <shoky> so yeah manfrin`laptop you need the url as first argument
[15:26:59] <manfrin`laptop> makes sense
[15:27:16] <manfrin`laptop> barf, now now getting data -- but this is at least something i can debug
[15:27:18] <manfrin`laptop> thank you!
[15:27:19] <shoky> or just use $.ajax like a grownup :P
[15:27:45] <robertmaxrees> ^^ all day every day
[15:28:08] <manfrin`laptop> kk
[15:28:20] <manfrin`laptop> wow
[15:28:22] <manfrin`laptop> that fixed it
[15:28:25] <manfrin`laptop> ung :|
[15:28:37] <manfrin`laptop> i like js/jquery, but it is so weird with breaks
[15:28:42] <manfrin`laptop> ruby is so, so much easier to debug
[15:28:54] <robertmaxrees> there's a debugger in your browser fwiw
[15:28:58] <robertmaxrees> also: console.log()
[15:29:43] <manfrin`laptop> yeah
[15:29:51] <manfrin`laptop> and i got a react tool installed
[15:30:14] <manfrin`laptop> it's not as bad as it used to be, but ruby has neat things like binding.pry, where you can just stop your code and get a console
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> you just have to approach js differently.  once you grok it, things are easier.
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> you can use debug statements with js
[15:30:33] <manfrin`laptop> yep yep -- 3 years on, but been 80% ruby, 20% js
[15:30:35] <robertmaxrees> and use your console
[15:30:44] <manfrin`laptop> ye
[15:30:52] <manfrin`laptop> i just need to learn to use breakpoints
[15:31:01] <manfrin`laptop> which i think is as close as i can get to a binding.pry like functionality
[15:31:05] <robertmaxrees> and your dev tools in general.  they're pretty handle.
[15:31:10] <robertmaxrees> debug;
[15:31:12] <manfrin`laptop> (which gives you a console *at* the point you leave it)
[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> that's how you get that
[15:31:17] <manfrin`laptop> o
[15:31:19] <manfrin`laptop> nice
[15:31:19] <shoky> manfrin`laptop btw nowadays it's nicer to just do  $.get(url).done(function(data) { ... })
[15:31:28] <manfrin`laptop> yeah, i had had something like that
[15:31:28] <shoky> no object needed
[15:31:40] <manfrin`laptop> but ended up where i was trying to iron down the bug
[15:31:45] <shoky> kk
[15:31:50] <manfrin`laptop> will change it to that though
[15:33:09] <manfrin`laptop> trying to level up my js game a bit, company is mostly node, but we're a little rails team in the middle
[15:33:19] <manfrin`laptop> react seemed nice, so I'm making a little podcast site
[15:33:31] <robertmaxrees> JS has matured a lot in the last few years.  you'll be pleasantly surprised.
[15:34:13] <manfrin`laptop> yep yep, been watching the changes
[15:34:23] <manfrin`laptop> random fact from my life:
[15:34:39] <manfrin`laptop> when i was 13 or 14, i hired this argentinian kid (who was also 13/14) to code me something
[15:34:42] <manfrin`laptop> some old php script
[15:34:44] <manfrin`laptop> that kid
[15:34:48] <manfrin`laptop> wrote socket.io
[15:35:11] <manfrin`laptop> so, in a way, i helped finance his learning that led to socketio :D
[15:35:52] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:35:53] <robertmaxrees> not bad
[15:36:00] <shoky> finance me i'll build whatever you ask ;D
[15:36:14] <manfrin`laptop> kek
[15:36:23] <manfrin`laptop> ill finance you to build me a deck
[15:36:25] <manfrin`laptop> with a hot tub
[15:36:27] <manfrin`laptop> lol
[15:36:33] <shoky> on it
[15:36:39] <shoky> searching npm.
[15:36:41] <wishie> I realise its not an issue with jQuery, but i thought I should mention that it doesnt work at all with Safari 9 developer seeds
[15:37:07] <manfrin`laptop> npm install backyard-deck backyard-hottub --save
[15:37:34] <shoky> word
[15:37:38] <robertmaxrees> wishie that may be an issue - mention it in #jquery-dev
[15:38:01] <robertmaxrees> wishie what version of jquery are you trying it with?
[15:39:09] <wishie> trying to work out in this project.. but it seems broken on all i think.. let me check before i go any further
[15:39:57] <wishie> http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[15:40:00] <wishie> so assume the latest
[15:41:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not latest.  but okay.
[15:41:49] <wishie> ok, thats just the line included in this project
[15:42:04] <wishie> i would have assumed that was a link to the 'latest' (stable) release
[15:42:08] <robertmaxrees> try the 3.0 alpha
[15:42:31] <onefix> I have a ticker that uses the JQuery animate function to show different <UL> tags (kind of like a slide show) and I'm trying to figure out a way to make the animation leave in the same direction it came in...
[15:43:02] <robertmaxrees> wishie and linking to a non-specific version is a kind of "dangerous" idea, in that things can change that can break your code.
[15:43:15] <robertmaxrees> onefix make a fiddle maybe?>
[15:43:45] <wishie> im reading about it now robertmaxrees.. apparently those URLs arent updated anymore, and points *forever* to 1.11.1
[15:43:45] <onefix> robertmaxrees: Maybe
[15:44:00] <robertmaxrees> wishie yeah, i'd try the 3.0 alpha.
[15:44:01] <wishie> well, jquery-latest.js at least
[15:44:05] <wishie> ok, ill give that a go
[15:44:15] <robertmaxrees> wishie yeah, because that wasn't supposed to be for public consumption originally.
[15:50:22] <wishie> ok, so i tried 2.1.4 first, and it works
[15:50:36] <robertmaxrees> wishie that's interesting.  2.1.4 just drops support for old browsersd.
[15:50:37] <wishie> so the issue was obviously the project developer including the static url version
[15:50:38] <robertmaxrees> *browsers
[15:51:07] <wishie> well 'jquery.js' is 1.11.1, right?
[15:51:14] <wishie> so 2.1.4 is quite a few versions newer
[15:51:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:51:25] <robertmaxrees> 1.x and 2.x are lockstepped in features.
[15:51:33] <robertmaxrees> the 2.x series just drops support for old browsers.
[15:51:38] <wishie> hmm
[15:51:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/browser-support/ explains it
[15:52:44] <robertmaxrees> 1.11.3 and 2.1.4 support the exact same features - 2.1.4 simply doesn't support IE 6, 7, or 8, where 1.11.3 does
[15:53:42] <wishie> ok, so... Safari used to work without issue on 1.11.1 (jquery.js)
[15:53:53] <wishie> but since the latest Safari 9 developer seeds, it stopped working
[15:54:06] <robertmaxrees> but started working when you linked 2.1.4?
[15:54:13] <wishie> so the latest safari breaks something.. i dont think jquery is the issue at all
[15:54:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd still report it.
[15:54:37] <wishie> but that means that something happened from 1.11.1 to 11.11.3(?) that fixes it
[15:54:42] <robertmaxrees> unless the latest 1.x supports it.
[15:54:44] <Rene> Hi! I am converting an existing menu to a jquery accordion-menu. Unfortunately i'm not smart enough to figure out what i'm doing worng.. I found a couple of jquery-examples, but i can't fit it to my menuâ€¦ Could someone be so kind and have a look what i'm messing up.. http://jsfiddle.net/hertell/v04cszum/4/
[15:54:57] <wishie> i could try 1.11.3 i guess
[15:54:57] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:55:48] <wishie> 1.11.3 also appears to work
[15:56:14] <robertmaxrees> wishie try a local version of 1.11.1 then.
[15:56:20] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if it was just linking it externally.
[15:56:51] <wishie> hmm
[15:56:57] <wishie> 1.11.1 remotely is ok
[15:57:01] <wishie> jquery-1.11.1.js
[15:57:48] <wishie> hmm, its caused other errors though
[16:08:14] <wishie> hmm ok
[16:08:36] <wishie> so the issue is including jquery.js as opposed to jquery-1.11.1.js.. which i find odd
[16:09:39] <shoky> Rene:  you're not including jquery.  menu_ul.hide()  hides all those divs so thats why they're all hidden. and your selector is wrong here: $('.mymenu > li > a')  there are no <a>'s that are direct children of those <li>'s
[16:18:39] <Rene> shoky: Thanks for helping me out. I found out where to add the js-part :-) I also did an update, and it looks that it worls partially: http://jsfiddle.net/hertell/v04cszum/5/ but now it hides everything..
[16:27:32] <shoky> Rene: you're doing  $(this).addClass('active').next()   but  $(this) is the clicked <a>  and there is no sibling elements after the <a>'s so .next() doesn't find anything
[16:35:09] <Rene> shoky: hmm.. let's see if i understood what you said :-) I'll try to poke around a bit :-)
[19:09:30] <dot> One question: why does this redirects to ajax requested page: http://pastebin.com/kHRt8VyE instead of getting results into data ?
[19:16:17] <docmur__> I had this code in my main.php file: http://pastie.org/10367508, then took it out, through it into main.js, added <script src="main.js"></script> to the bottom of my main.php file and it doesn't work, really confused as to why, it worked when the code was inline in the file.
[19:22:51] <Max-P> docmur__: Check if it gets loaded first in the console, and also check for any error in there
[19:34:23] <docmur__> Hmm no console errors and I can see the line in the Development tools source viewer
[19:34:49] <docmur__> and in the source viewer I can click it and it loads
