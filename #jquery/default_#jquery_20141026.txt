[01:03:47] <DFlat> Lok on the right hand side, where the numbered rules are. hover over a rule
[01:11:05] <Kartagis> DFlat: you could do this with jquery and css, no need for an additional lib

[04:34:35] <frank__> I wanted to use mouseOver, not hover
[04:35:09] <doug64k> it's a very small change
[04:35:34] <doug64k> pass that first function to mouseOver and the 2nd to mouseout
[04:35:39] <doug64k> Out*
[04:36:09] <doug64k> .hover is mouseOver and mouseOut in one
[04:38:00] <frank__> I would functionally pass out if I tried. Great Doug64k guru, I know it is asking too much but would you graciously assist me yet again as I am trembling?

[05:32:42] <banisterfiend> hi all, i have the following code: `$.ajax(type: "DELETE", url: $(e.target).attr('href'), dataType: "JSON")`    however sometimes it does a 'delete' on the current URL, erasing completely the wrong thing, which is horrible. My question is in what situations this would happen? just when $(e.target).attr('href') is null? or also other situations? say if attr('href') is '' or is '#' too?
[05:33:00] <banisterfiend> i want to check and avoid that situation, by showing an error
[05:43:05] <sacho> if attr is '', and # too.
[05:43:30] <sacho> any relative or absolute url that is equal to the current one.
[05:50:53] <banisterfiend> sacho thanks, is there a general way of checking that? maybe a helper method from jquery?
[05:51:17] <banisterfiend> sacho or do i have to literally do the three checks: null, '', '#' ?
[05:53:20] <banisterfiend> sacho is this legit? `      if $(e.target).attr('href') in ['', '#', null, undefined]` ?
[05:53:36] <sacho> no
[05:53:43] <sacho> why do you have this problem at all?
[05:54:45] <banisterfiend> sacho it's code i'm working with is not 100% reliable, sometimes the ajax doesn't properly update the link element and sets it as null or '', i will get around to fixing it eventualy but i need a quick for this right now as there's a fast deadline coming up
[05:55:12] <sacho> so if you're setting it to null or '', then check for null or ''
[05:55:46] <banisterfiend> sacho that's what the code above does, so why did you say it wasn't legit? :)
[05:56:06] <banisterfiend> but it also checks for '#' and undefined as an extra paranoic step :)
[05:58:06] <sacho> banisterfiend, extra paranoic from what, ghosts changing your code?
[05:58:33] <banisterfiend> sacho from spaghetti js code that i didn't write that i have to guard against
[05:58:40] <banisterfiend> sacho until i get the bandwidth to fix it
[06:02:14] <DartmanX> can someone look at my first attempt at using $.Deferred() and tell me if it looks okay? I needed a function that would allow a callback when I called $('#div').empty(). http://jsfiddle.net/kp9d3okj
[06:03:27] <DartmanX> it works for single cases, but Im worried it won't work if the callback has something like an ajax call
[06:04:40] <DartmanX> s/single/simple
[06:06:59] <sacho> what exactly is this code supposed to do
[06:12:00] <DartmanX> it's supposed to attach a callback to the empty() function
[06:12:25] <DartmanX> instead of extending the actual empty() function, I just created a wrapper instead
[06:13:37] <DartmanX> I used the deferred stuff in case the callback had something like an ajax call that I would need to wait on before actually calling the empty() function
[06:13:45] <sacho> what does the deferred have to do with this, then
[06:16:39] <DartmanX> I need to ensure the callback function is executed before the empty() method is actually called, so I used deferred to execute the callback in case the callback does something asynchronous like an ajax call
[06:17:35] <DartmanX> I can put something like alert('whatever') inside the callback and it works
[06:43:13] <aidan___> When I do "$('.photostream.autoload').each(function () {" my browser hangs ... is there any way I can force it to wait until something in the asyncronous loop has finished?
[06:48:31] <DartmanX> aidan: the answer is probably $.Deferred() but Im still trying to figure it out myself
[06:51:33] <sacho> DartmanX, the deferreds don't do that
[06:52:13] <sacho> aidan___, I'm not sure how the two things are related
[06:53:14] <aidan___> http://dpaste.com/3NSVJ9P
[06:54:12] <aidan> something like that
[06:55:18] <ZacHarney> Is there a way to show a loader gif when using background-image instead of img tag? Like having <div style="background-image: url(/* gif */);" data-bg="/* Image Url */"></div> and load the image from the data attr then swap into the background-image style?
[06:57:11] <Medunes> what is the simplest (most basic) jquery slider ?
[06:57:45] <aidan> ah, http://dpaste.com/3XKHKV2
[06:57:52] <aidan> I wanted setInterval
[07:07:07] <ZacHarney> hello? does anyone know how to do what I asked above?
[07:09:24] <decx> just stack divs and have the loading gif in the lowest one
[07:21:27] <ZacHarney> decx  thanks. seems obvious now, but too tired to think of edit the html i guess :/

[08:15:16] <RWOverdijk> I'm looking for a plugin that allows you to resize an image in the browser by dragging the corners... I found the jQueryUI one but that comes with a ton of deps. Any suggestions? :)
[08:52:22] <krambiorix> hi, i want to trigger the change event on a disabled field, but it seems that it's not possible.... How can i bypass this in an elegant way?
[09:06:23] <sacho> use .trigger()
[09:39:39] <Bogdaniel> can someone help me with a problem at jquery ?
[09:41:35] <Bogdaniel> http://78.97.33.190/admin/group-manager i have this page with some data from mysql and i have a button delete. when i click on it and check what id it returns me it always returns 1
[09:45:24] <systemfault> You need to learn how to use "this" inside event handlers to refer to the currently clicked element
[09:47:53] <Bogdaniel> systemfault, i noticed the error there.. i was playing with the code earlier .. because i think it has to do with this to get the correct id from the event but i'm not sure how to do it
[09:49:57] <Bogdaniel> systemfault, just had to look a little bit on docs :D fixed the problem :D
[09:50:05] <Bogdaniel> i wasn't using it "this" the right way :D
[09:50:19] <systemfault> Great :)
[09:58:53] <Bogdaniel> systemfault, that fixed only a portion of my problem .. it still doesn't select the id from my table .. it always returns undefined
[09:59:30] <systemfault> You need to find a way to get the id from the modal
[09:59:44] <Nadi3d_> hi People
[09:59:49] <systemfault> PErhaps by passing it to the modal
[10:01:17] <Bogdaniel> well on the delete button i have group-delete-id as data attribute
[10:02:34] <coderfromcincy> you can select the data attribute value like this $("[data='group-delete-id']").css("color","red")
[10:06:54] <Nadi3d_> is there an iteraction like clickable instead of draggable ?
[10:07:31] <coderfromcincy> $("elementname").on("click",function(){ //do something }):
[10:07:46] <coderfromcincy> creates an eventHandler so its essentially "clickable" now lol
[10:10:59] <Nadi3d_> I have a trouble with form builder so I did something like $( ".field" ).click(function(event)  this one display a form but depents of a div that I have clicked before.  it works but if  I click inside the div then it doesn't recognize the  element
[10:15:28] <coderfromcincy> Nadi3d do you have an example
[10:19:02] <Nadi3d_> http://demos.anupshinde.com/form-builder-part2-1_kevin_d/index.html is like this one but I need an element already there load the the form window. what I did it load but it need to click in some place of the div
[10:23:51] <coderfromcincy> i need to see the code.. jsfiddle?
[10:32:45] <Bogdaniel> systemfault, in the end i did like this: when i click on the delete button i append the data-attribute to the modal window and from there i get it to use it is it ok like this or i'm just messing everything :D?
[10:34:30] <Nadi3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/qy1av7m8/1/ :S  I didn't manage how to run on it
[10:40:43] <coderfromcincy> is it the preview button?
[10:42:18] <Nadi3d_> well it's not woking there.
[10:42:41] <Nadi3d_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/p4KNKGzb
[10:42:56] <Nadi3d_> this one loads  with click and
[10:44:23] <Nadi3d_> and inside the js there is other that is draggable  that one work well.  with click I have no clue how it works  recognize the div but in certain area

[11:44:48] <KamalKaur> Hello all! I want to make my table header and left two columns fixed. I'm looking for some simple way to do this and $("#demo").freezeHeader({ 'height': '300px' }); did nothing to the table of id demo. What am I missing?
[11:45:52] <tiron> KamalKaur: you using a plugin or something? what's that function?
[11:46:23] <Serb_Almighty> $('body').html(''); // solves all
[11:47:08] <tiron> Serb_Almighty: might as well $('body').remove()
[11:47:14] <KamalKaur> Serb_Almighty: I read about it here: http://www.fixedheadertable.com/
[11:47:29] <Serb_Almighty> window = null;
[11:47:48] <tiron> Serb_Almighty: i don't think that'd work, would it?
[11:48:27] <tiron> probably want to save on performance and do a document.body.innerHTML = null;
[11:49:22] <tiron> KamalKaur: try to isolate your html structure into jsbin.com or jsfiddle or something, run the plugin there and see if you can't get the results... this also makes it easier to diagnose
[11:49:51] <Serb_Almighty> or alt+f4
[11:56:05] <KamalKaur> tiron: Can you isolate Django templates there?
[11:56:08] <P0rk> Hey all. Does anyone know of a prescription ajax service or a medical condition ajax service?
[11:57:32] <tiron> KamalKaur: probably not, what you wanna do you copy over the bare-bone html structure of whatever your django template is rendering on the client side, then use that in jsbin/jsfiddle
[11:57:41] <tiron> they are client-side only, pretty much
[12:22:49] * CssN00b good morning and good night y'all
[12:31:59] <curvv> hi, should ajaxStart and ajaxStop work with jQuery 1.11?
[12:35:17] <tw2113> i don't see why they'd stop working
[12:38:02] <curvv> actually i can't get it to work with 2.1 either..
[12:38:10] <curvv> so i've screwed up somewhere...
[12:39:39] <mkander> Hi people. I have a multi page form cosisting of multiple fieldsets. I find the current fieldset with this: current_fs = $(this).closest('fieldset');
[12:39:59] <mkander> But now I need to check if there exists a child of this fieldset with id "asdf"
[12:40:17] <mkander> Any suggestions would be very helpful :)
[12:41:33] <curvv> oh it needs to be attached to document since 1.8 :)
[12:42:41] <Serb_Almighty> $('body').serbia(); makes a Great Serbia even more Greater!
[12:48:02] <coderfromcincy> hey mkander
[12:49:06] <coderfromcincy> childrencount = $(this).closest('fieldset').find("#asdf").length ... so if (childrencount) {// do something }
[12:50:18] <mkander> Works! :) Thank you very much!
[12:50:19] <decx> ids are unique everything between $ and ("# is poitnless
[12:50:35] <coderfromcincy> for beginners it helps them dec
[12:50:43] <coderfromcincy> no problem mk
[12:50:58] <decx> even worse to not say that to beginners
[12:51:15] <coderfromcincy> its worse to give them too much up front and overwhelm them
[12:51:42] <decx> doesnt apply to this case
[12:51:45] <decx> ids are unique
[12:51:58] <coderfromcincy> i can select multiple elements on the page with the same ID
[12:52:13] <decx> it's invalid
[12:52:22] <coderfromcincy> invalid but it works
[12:52:28] <decx> not really
[12:52:39] <coderfromcincy> how does "it works" mean "not really"
[12:52:44] <coderfromcincy> if it works it works
[12:52:45] <decx> well it doesnt
[12:53:05] <coderfromcincy> it works for me..
[12:53:10] <coderfromcincy> even though its not best practice
[12:53:14] <Serb_Almighty> serbia
[12:53:37] <decx> observe http://jsfiddle.net/1zqebh0o/
[12:54:14] <decx> it not a not best practise, it'S wrong
[12:55:09] <decx> it's in the name too, you know: id ^^
[12:55:20] <coderfromcincy> you are referring to jquery specifically
[12:55:22] <coderfromcincy> pure JS
[12:55:23] <coderfromcincy> is differnet
[12:55:28] <coderfromcincy> different
[12:56:18] <decx> no
[12:58:27] <coderfromcincy> dec
[12:58:27] <coderfromcincy> yes
[12:58:28] <coderfromcincy> $('div#blah').addClass("stuff");
[12:58:32] <coderfromcincy> it works
[12:58:54] <decx> someone
[12:59:04] <coderfromcincy> you see it?
[12:59:06] <decx> please shut this down
[12:59:12] <coderfromcincy> have you tried it lol
[12:59:22] <decx> div#id is stupid
[12:59:25] <decx> because ids are unique
[12:59:34] <decx> stop spreading this nonsense please
[12:59:59] <coderfromcincy> are you mad because i proved you wrong?
[13:00:03] <coderfromcincy> its not a big deal
[13:00:07] <decx> good lord
[13:00:09] <coderfromcincy> lol
[13:00:13] <tw2113> i agree, specifying the div with the id attribute is pointless
[13:00:25] <Serb_Almighty> $($).prop('disabled', true);
[13:00:47] <coderfromcincy> tw2113 just because its pointless doesnt mean it doesnt work
[13:00:56] <coderfromcincy> thats what the argument is about
[13:01:00] <krambiorix> hi, i try to do 600 - -100 and i get  the error "invalid decrement operand" -> anyone any idea?
[13:01:26] <tw2113> yeah, there's no reason for it not to work, it's just extremely not needed
[13:01:32] <coderfromcincy> thank you tw
[13:01:33] <decx> it's not an argument
[13:01:35] <coderfromcincy> thats what i meant
[13:01:41] <coderfromcincy> dec wasnt trying to hear it
[13:01:42] <decx> multiple same ids are wrong by spec
[13:01:53] <shoky> if you want it to stop, stop feeding
[13:01:55] <coderfromcincy> its wrong but thats not what the damn conversation was about
[13:01:56] <tw2113> stop reusing IDs in the same page
[13:02:00] <decx> doesnt matter if some esoteric implementation of itworks because browsers are so forgiving
[13:02:15] <tw2113> classes are reuseable in the same page
[13:02:18] <shoky> why argue with someone who just wants to win
[13:02:20] <tw2113> IDs are not, as per spec
[13:02:28] <coderfromcincy> i agree shoky
[13:02:31] <decx> but i already won :(
[13:02:37] <decx> because ids are unique :D
[13:02:43] <tw2113> should be
[13:02:52] <tw2113> doesn't mean the person with the text editor is making it so
[13:02:52] <coderfromcincy> they are unique to the element(s) that have them
[13:02:58] <krambiorix> anyone?
[13:03:14] <tw2113> they should be unique within the whole page, not just per DOM element/tag
[13:04:03] <coderfromcincy> yeah.... what they said
[13:04:29] <Medunes> Can anybody help me with a name of a jquery slider with (basic) options (not complicated)
[13:04:33] <tw2113> there, i solved everyone's issue regarding ID attributes

[13:35:17] <SeeThruHead> Hello everyone!
[13:36:23] <SeeThruHead> I've got a question for you all, when creating a jquery plugin would you put your plugin logic (functions) inside the $.fn.plugin() {}; or declare them inside a shared closure
[14:01:39] <printForever> guys, looking for some help with this simple code
[14:01:39] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/qKE54CTe
[14:02:11] <printForever> when I hover the element, the toggleClass isn't adding anything
[14:03:36] <beshoo>  <printForever>  try add class remove calss !
[14:04:16] <printForever> beshoo, you sure?
[14:04:37] <decx> fiddle up
[14:04:55] <decx> toggleClass works just fine
[14:05:41] <printForever> decx, example_
[14:05:42] <printForever> ?
[14:06:54] <decx> yes make an example :p
[14:07:03] <printForever> I pasted the pastebin thing...
[14:07:13] <decx> doesnt help without the html
[14:07:50] <printForever> the problem is that I'm trying to apply the class to the element that is a sibiling to the selected element
[14:08:00] <printForever> maybe it cant backtrace?
[14:08:09] <decx> make a fiddle
[14:08:48] <printForever> Icant
[14:09:08] <decx> you can
[14:09:41] <decx> copy the #megamenu html, put in fiddle, copy your hover put in fiddle, add jquery, there's the separate testcase
[14:10:22] <printForever> .hover is not firing
[14:10:31] <decx> anything we can say based on that .hover() paste is pure speculation witohut the html

[18:32:49] <BillCriswell> Hmm.. working with draggable and droppable always makes me think differently.
[19:08:52] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm trying to change the contents of a div on load like $('.myclass').html('New content')
[19:09:00] <bl4ckdu5t> I did that but nothing happens
[19:13:28] <bl4ckdu5t> no one's up :(
[19:17:10] <LiENUS> bl4ckdu5t, how are you calling that?

[19:57:38] <sammych1> quandry: jQM has 'swipe' but it only works for touch or mouse. Not both at the same time.
[19:57:52] <sammych1> which is sucky because I'm building an app for a hybrid device.
[19:58:38] <sammych1> so: what's the best JS code/library/etc that'll get me a touch swipe event?

[23:36:38] <daftspunk> Can anyone explain this strange behavior? http://jsfiddle.net/6m0rm9cy/1/
[23:43:59] <Uhkis_> where's the strange behaviour?
[23:44:27] <daftspunk> Is it supposed to bubble up to the DIV like that?
[23:44:43] <Uhkis> you're triggering the div's event, how is that strange
[23:44:59] <daftspunk> Triggering the anchors event only, but it fires on the div
[23:45:31] <Uhkis> on('testEvent'
[23:45:36] <Uhkis> trigger('testEvent')
[23:45:57] <Uhkis> and your .element applies to div and a
[23:46:21] <daftspunk> Ya but I'm firing on the link only, not sure why the div is being fired
[23:47:45] <daftspunk> Or maybe I just didn't realise that .trigger() will bubble up the dom
