[00:01:16] <delinquentme> is there an array operator like [-1] in jquery?
[00:10:03] <xdjuj__> [08:03]  <agu---> xdjuj__: that's wrong. you can be both a developer and a designer.
[00:10:10] <xdjuj__> If you think so… :)
[00:10:33] <xdjuj__> You can be both
[00:10:42] <xdjuj__> But you can't be good at both
[00:10:50] <xdjuj__> You can be a bad designer AND a bad developper
[00:10:53] <xdjuj__> No problem
[00:11:32] <xdjuj__> But you can't be the best developper and the best designer, that's two VERY different job, and you have to choose.
[00:11:43] <xdjuj__> That's why it's a team job
[00:12:08] <xdjuj__> And if you think you are good at both :) That's because you certainly are bad at both
[00:15:09] <delinquentme> jquery selector + variable evaluation?
[00:15:32] <delinquentme> for something like $('#biome_instance-0')  where I'd like to sub in a var to get 0,1,2,3 etc
[00:21:13] <Eviltwin> delinquentme: Use string concatenation
[00:21:21] <Eviltwin> $('#biome_instance-' + i)
[00:21:34] <delinquentme> yeah i spaced on adding the - in the string =P
[00:21:44] <delinquentme> Eviltwin, autotesting jquery?
[00:22:04] <Eviltwin> Am I? No.
[00:22:47] <dido> delinquentme, just concatenate the string and your var? $("#biome_instance-" + yourVar)
[00:23:08] <delinquentme> nah I mean what about a library to do it
[00:23:11] <dido> Beaten by Eviltwin
[00:23:34] <Eviltwin> I've heard good things about this: http://code.google.com/p/jqunit/
[00:46:16] <r500> http://jsfiddle.net/saQ34/ is there any way i can give a different width for the submenu  than  top menu?
[00:46:33] <r500> i  have long scrollable menu
[01:17:43] <kentaromiura> haaaaaappy new year jq!
[01:18:21] <coldhead> thanks kent, same to you
[01:19:13] <badbandit> isnt the .on() command supposed to work for elements that were added after the page has loaded?
[01:20:32] <badbandit> http://dpaste.com/860058/
[01:20:42] <badbandit> L12, only works on first image loaded as default
[01:21:21] <badbandit> when I switch them, the new default image just follows the link, no event.preventDefault(), no colorbox
[01:26:42] <b2l> for the on to work, you have to bind it to an already in dom element
[01:27:14] <b2l> ie: $("existing_element").on('event', 'some element that might be added to the dom', function(e) { ... });
[01:32:46] <badbandit> ok so then I still need to use .live)_
[01:33:07] <badbandit> .live(), I thought .on replaced that but it seems that .live works and .on doesnt
[01:33:15] <badbandit> for elements added dynamically
[01:34:34] <dido> badbandit, .on() has replaced .live()
[01:35:39] <badbandit> ok, well this is my page http://eyesuck.webfactional.com/shop/beach-posters/thailand/thailand-beach-poster, I want just the default to use a lightbox
[01:35:45] <badbandit> I since rewrote the js
[01:35:47] <becom33> http://pastebin.com/nak8u88f I want to add a minimize & maximize event
[01:36:13] <dido> try $defaultImage.on('click', 'a', function(event) {...})
[01:36:14] <badbandit> http://dpaste.com/860063/
[01:36:16] <badbandit> doesnt work
[01:36:25] <xxtjaxx> I got a draggable with a couple of buttons on it. How can I set draggable only for one element in it so click events dont happen on the buttons in it?
[01:39:52] <badbandit> updated it, products.js is at bottom... did as you said and its not working
[01:40:06] <badbandit> after image swap, the new large image just follows the href
[01:46:42] <TheHackOps> soup
[01:47:16] <TheHackOps> Anyone apart of the php irc channel
[01:50:09] <NodeX> ##php = arrogant knobends#
[01:50:16] <TheHackOps> Lol
[01:50:18] <NodeX> (the channel anyway)
[01:50:21] <TheHackOps> channel doesn't exist
[01:50:26] <TheHackOps> and #php is private
[01:50:32] <NodeX> ##php exists
[01:50:52] <TheHackOps> strange im not identified
[01:50:54] <TheHackOps> my bad
[01:50:55] <TheHackOps> tenks
[01:51:58] <badbandit> the value of $(this) is not changing
[01:52:02] <badbandit> with .on()
[01:52:06] <badbandit> w-t-f
[01:52:41] <NodeX> !fiddle
[01:52:49] <NodeX> ?fiddle | badbandit
[01:53:04] <NodeX> lol, fiddle your code
[01:54:00] <badbandit> balhh, so tired but ill try
[01:54:04] <badbandit> but it looks simple enough http://dpaste.com/860066/
[01:58:32] <NodeX> which bit doesn't work?
[01:59:44] <badbandit> the image swaps out fine
[02:00:00] <badbandit> but the colorbox part always just loads the first image from when page loaded
[02:00:14] <badbandit> i checked and the $(this) isn't changing
[02:00:45] <badbandit> so first part of code works to swap image, 2nd part to use colorbox on bigger image fails after swap
[02:01:02] <NodeX>   var $defaultImage = $(".product-imagegroup-default"); <--- that#s set when doc.ready is called
[02:01:17] <badbandit> yeah thats what I thought
[02:01:22] <badbandit> can I have that changed?
[02:01:24] <NodeX> if you want the current value of it then you must call it again inside on()
[02:01:26] <badbandit> dynamically
[02:01:38] <badbandit> I see
[02:02:01] <NodeX> or call it like you have above
[02:02:03] <NodeX> $(".product-imagegroup-image")

[03:50:25] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:51:13] <jomofcw> Using jQuery UI I would like to change a hidden input's value in addition to the change of the auto completed field, how to please ?
[04:16:09] <salentinux> Hi guys, in my project i have a plugin to show a preloader on each image. The problem is that I don't want to call the plugin function each time I add image via for example an ajax query. Is there a way to set a "live" behaviour"?
[04:17:32] <salentinux> I konw abont ".on(event, function())"  but which event should I use?
[04:22:05] <rmill> load
[04:43:36] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to develop a HTML5 video player that is able to "display" images and html pages (either added or specified through URL)
[04:43:41] <sunbeam> the player also needs to be able to play video/audio files
[04:43:44] <sunbeam> i could get that the most logical way to display images/urls is through an iframne
[04:43:52] <sunbeam> but combined with the video/audio player, is there something that can do this al together?
[05:04:39] <jomofcw> Using jQuery UI auto-complete : I would like to change a hidden input's value in addition to the change of the auto-completed field, how to do it please ? [I already have the auto complete working well receiving a "complex" JSON Data as source]
[05:06:00] <Stephen> You're looking for either the onblur or onselect event
[05:06:31] <Stephen> Er, my mistake
[05:06:33] <Stephen> autocomplete
[05:06:38] <Stephen> you're looking for onkeyup
[05:08:45] <Stephen> jomofcw: You could hook the auto-complete field's onkeyup & onchange events to update the hidden field
[05:10:15] <Stephen> Is the hidden input receiving a value from a property on the complex object you are using on the autocomplete?
[05:10:30] <fabioportieri> i got this error on chrome, but not on ie or firefox: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'tellSelect' of undefined " referring to global variable jcrop_api .. any ideas?
[05:11:53] <Stephen> fabioportieri: My guess is that your getting a race condition between a library and code that references it
[05:12:28] <fabioportieri> Stephen: you may be right
[05:12:46] <fabioportieri> dunno how to solve tho
[05:12:47] <Stephen> fabioportieri: In cases like this it's best to wrap your code inside a callback which is referenced as the last line in the library
[05:13:15] <fabioportieri> i load several libraries, then i put my code at last
[05:13:16] <Stephen> Or, you could wrap all your code in an event handler, and have that event thrown as the last line of the library
[05:13:28] <Stephen> Are they separate files, or all one file?
[05:13:32] <fabioportieri> inside document.ready
[05:13:40] <fabioportieri> separate files
[05:13:53] <Stephen> each file loads asynchronously
[05:14:12] <fabioportieri> oh i see
[05:14:23] <Stephen> Basically, your main code is getting executed before the library is doen
[05:14:26] <Stephen> loading
[05:14:46] <fabioportieri> but i was hoping that when i put my code inside $(document).ready() will suffice
[05:15:04] <fabioportieri> not really i guess
[05:15:21] <Stephen> $(document).ready() only guarantees jQuery, DOM, and jQuery objects
[05:15:58] <Stephen> Are you familiar with jQuery deferreds?
[05:15:59] <fabioportieri> for instance i use jcrop and jquery ui (and others), how can i make sure my code is executed after all libraries are loaded?
[05:16:11] <fabioportieri> never heard of them
[05:16:21] <seutje> they're the shit!
[05:16:32] <Stephen> Basically, go read up on deferreds
[05:16:47] <Stephen> You want a simple one, don't worry about reading too much into them
[05:16:50] <Stephen> They can get complicated
[05:16:56] <fabioportieri> i see..
[05:16:57] <fabioportieri> well
[05:17:03] <fabioportieri> many thanks Stephen
[05:17:05] <Stephen> In this case, you are just trying to emulate events
[05:17:40] <Stephen> create a deferred at the beginning of each external lib, and resolve it at the end of each external lib
[05:18:06] <Stephen> then just wrap your main code in a .when() which references all your deferreds
[05:18:22] <Stephen> It will ensure that your code only runs when all the libs are loaded
[05:18:40] <fabioportieri> fantastic, i'll try right away
[05:19:07] <seutje> remember the good old days, when u'd just stuff that in a looped try/catch?
[05:19:29] <seutje> and then whoever had to debug it was all "WTFBLACKMAGIC"
[05:19:49] <abnorm> hello folks .. and happy new year!
[05:20:09] <Stephen> seutje: Your attempt at humor has induced vomitting
[05:20:22] <seutje> close enough
[05:21:11] <Stephen> Well, I don't actually get to vomit... I just try repeatedly and catch myself....
[05:21:23] <Stephen> but we all know what happens when I get out of this
[05:21:24] <seutje> I always vomit when laughing though, it's a thing around here
[05:21:36] <Stephen> I throw it, at YOU!
[05:21:41] <Stephen> Finally...
[05:22:03] <Stephen> (it's too early for this here, not sure if I'm being humorous or a jerk.)
[05:22:32] <seutje> always thought those were synonymous
[05:22:48] <Stephen> lol
[05:23:06] <Stephen> Only when you're aiming for the cans.
[05:23:18] <seutje> or maybe my jokes are just always at the expense of some heralded minority
[05:23:30] <cuddle`> hello, I have a problem with jQM, I've used the subpages plugin, and on the first page it seems to load all the subpages just fine (shown in inspector), but after the first page change, all the subpages disappear from the inspector and the a hrefs stop working
[05:23:40] <jomofcw> Stephen hello and thanks for your answer. But the value I want to apply to the hidden field won't be in the auto completed field.
[05:23:57] <cuddle`> anyone know what I can do?
[05:24:26] <Stephen> So, I need a 3rd party server which will, in essence, act as a buffer between the client and I by accepting the results of an API call the client makes
[05:25:18] <cuddle`> so basically, I have 2 html files, the 2nd contains all the subpages, this loads perfectly fine when I enter the first page, then subsequently when I click on the a href that leads to the 2nd page (containing all the subpages), suddenly all the subpages that were loaded from the 2nd page dissapear
[05:25:45] <cuddle`> when viewing the elements inside of the dev inspector
[05:25:46] <Stephen> jomofcw: It's fine, the value doesn't need to be in that field. The main point is to write your update function and to have it called on the autocomplete field's onkeyup & onchange (& possibly onblur) event,
[05:26:50] <Stephen> cuddle: Are you using a frame, or are you loading 2 html files at once?
[05:27:05] <jomofcw> Stephen OK, I should miss something, sorry :(. I give some try to that so.
[05:27:08] <cuddle`> none
[05:28:41] <cuddle`> I have index.html and rec.html, rec.html is the multipage html with the subpages. index.html has a <a> to rec.html. When I load index.html, I can see in the inspector that all the subpages from rec.html have loaded just fine. Then when I click the <a> to rec.html, everything still seems fine. But, once I click on the first subpage <a> within rec.html, all the other subpages dissapear
[05:28:49] <abnorm> I have a problem doing a post like this: http://pastebin.com/gySYankg  .. is it because of the url? Here is a printscreen whith tamperdata, you can se that the method says 'options', it should say 'post'  =s .. when doing a post the "normal" way, everythings ok. any tips?
[05:28:52] <cuddle`> from the inspector, and all subsequent subpage links stop working
[05:29:31] <Stephen> jomofcw: You might save yourself some time by looking up a library called require.js, it will also solve your problem
[05:29:33] <abnorm> ah the printscreen: http://www.bilddump.se/bilder/20130102131119-46.21.99.29.png
[05:30:41] <cuddle`> it's as if, whenever I enter a subpage, all other subpages stop existing
[05:30:59] <cuddle`> if I go back to the first page of the multipage, all subpages are readied to the DOM
[05:31:41] <Stephen> I'm not familiar with that plugin, but one would assume it would only leave in the dom what is necessary
[05:32:09] <Stephen> It's more common to remove elements from the dom for systems like this that it is to hide them, like we used too
[05:32:22] <Stephen> The pages would be cached into a javascript object
[05:33:17] <cuddle`> hmm
[05:34:12] <Stephen> You can try manipulating the underlying JS object, or shortcut around it with something like jQuery.live()
[05:34:44] <Stephen> .live() would allow you to manipulate the page each time it gets recreated
[05:35:30] <cuddle`> I can't seem to find whether it actually stores the pages
[05:35:37] <cuddle`> https://github.com/ToddThomson/jQuery-Mobile-Subpage-Widget/blob/master/jquery.mobile.subpage.js
[05:35:45] <cuddle`> but I still find it odd why the pages would be removed
[05:36:47] <Stephen> cuddle`: Have you gone to the console and tried to grab the other pages with a selector or something?
[05:37:05] <Stephen> Are we sure that the subpage is actually the root?
[05:37:28] <cuddle`> all the pages are added as childs of body
[05:37:35] <cuddle`> I can easily select them by their ID
[05:37:57] <Stephen> even after navigating to the subpage?
[05:38:31] <Stephen> If that's the cast then you just have a bug in the DOM viewer
[05:39:13] <Stephen> case^
[05:39:55] <Stephen> Im not going to go disect that lib for you
[05:40:22] <Stephen> but I'd look for .detach() somewhere in the code
[05:40:32] <cuddle`> ok
[05:41:10] <cuddle`> http://i.imgur.com/QHu45.png
[05:42:28] <cuddle`> maybe I did something wrong
[05:42:30] <fabioportieri> can i see somewhere an example to deferred() associated to a plugin? like jcrop or jquery-ui
[05:44:32] <Stephen> fabioportieri: You might just look up a library called require.js
[05:44:40] <Stephen> It will solve your problem
[05:44:56] <fabioportieri> ahh good
[05:45:00] <fabioportieri> thanks again
[05:45:11] <fabioportieri> howewer i'll paste my attempt if i'm doing it right
[05:46:29] <cuddle`> maybe its caching :S
[05:47:15] <Stephen> cuddle`: look for something that references $(".ui-subpage")
[05:47:55] <fabioportieri> something like that would work? http://pastie.org/5610741
[05:48:31] <cuddle`> oh Stephen thanks for the help, sorry for bothering, I had to cache the whole page adding data-dom-cache="true" to the page data-role
[05:48:45] <Stephen> cuddle`: Let's take a different angle. What are you trying to do that you are unable to do?
[05:48:51] <cuddle`> I was thinking it's the plugin, but it's jQM functionality :D
[05:48:53] <Stephen> k
[05:49:48] <Stephen> fabioportieri: yes, that is perfect.
[05:50:08] <fabioportieri> ok, many thanks again Stephen
[05:50:17] <Stephen> Oh, one more thing
[05:50:33] <Stephen> var deferredJcrop = new $.Deferred();
[05:50:51] <Stephen> You've wrapped that in a (function($) {
[05:51:04] <Stephen> It needs to be global
[05:51:37] <Stephen> Or at least handled in such a way that the .when() can get reference to it
[05:52:25] <Stephen> I'd declare it as the first line, and leave the resolve where it is
[05:53:26] <Stephen> .when() accepts an array as it's parameter, maybe you just make one global ScriptLoader object and push the Deferreds into it.
[05:58:58] <sasori> hi, how to select the label of a input text field ?
[05:59:14] <NodeX> closest?
[06:00:22] <sasori> like let's say i have input form e.g <label>blah</label><input type="text" id="blahID" />
[06:08:21] <jonez> sasori, not sure if this will work, but try adding a 'for' attribute to the label tag and search that way
[06:09:00] <sasori> jonez: e.g <label for="name of the input form"> ?
[06:09:21] <jonez> sasori, yes... normally I set the "for" attribute to the id of the input field
[06:09:31] <sasori> ok cool..thanks
[06:09:43] <jonez> are you allowed to search for a certain attribute?
[06:09:53] <sasori> jonez: yeah
[06:09:59] <jonez> oh then you're set then :)
[06:10:06] <sasori> ok

[07:34:31] <nFFF> AQEEL, that makes no sense :)

[08:02:39] <Jon47> cebor: maybe using nth-child selector?
[08:02:49] <cebor> .nextUntil(':not(br)').remove();    does this work ?
[08:03:06] <Jon47> cebor: what are you actually trying to do
[08:03:47] <Jon47> you can write code to accomplish it but it sounds like a confusing objective

[08:28:36] <tomasm-> hi, can anybody recommend a simple slideshow plugin for jquery, the type of thing that is used at the top of webpages? preferably something with numbers on top of the image to cycle through each. a lot of the ones I've seen are either too featureful or not quite what I need... is it hard to implement from scratch?
[08:29:36] <sethetter> tomasm-: It will definitely take much more time to implement from scratch. It would probably be faster to find a minimally featured one and add the features you need to it. Or just don't use features from the overly-featured ones.
[08:30:00] <tomasm-> is there a popular one out there?
[08:33:47] <tomasm-> hmm i found one that's only 200 lines of code and seems like it may work.... i was just concerned with code thats 4+ years old.
[09:03:57] <BulleTime> hey guys, anyone knows i can get the download process of a ajax request ( jqXHR) ??
[09:04:32] <BulleTime> id like to display the amount of percent loaded...
[09:10:23] <AQEEL> so any one want to help me out
[09:11:27] <bluesm> Hey!
[09:11:28] <iiicubed> hello, all... working on a multi-page jqmobile app where an element with a .new-feature CSS class is supposed to trigger a transparent overlay highlighting the new feature...
[09:12:21] <bluesm> Is there jquery which do NOT provide compatibility with older browsers ? For the sake of performance ?
[09:12:40] <iiicubed> problem is, when i try to detect the .ui-page-active class in the parent, the .bind("pageinit"...) fires BEFORE the active page class is applied, so i cannot tell if the parent data-role=page element is active or not
[09:13:30] <iiicubed> it's as if the pageinit is happening BEFORE the various pages are actually initialized
[09:14:14] <snollux> I need some tips on "animation" within JQuery -- here not referring to effects, but to rapidly switching out images. Right now my code is very sloppy and bad and depressing, and I know there must be a better way. http://pastebin.ca/2298761
[09:15:36] <iiicubed> any thoughts on when i can bind to the child of a page transitioning from inactive to active?
[09:19:06] <bluesm> ?
[09:22:01] <nFFF> snollux, paste to jsfiddle.net
[09:23:50] <BulleTime> anyone familiar with jqXHR?
[09:24:14] <BulleTime> (and willing to answer my question)
[09:26:16] <timwis> Hey guys, is it at all possible to detect the HTTP status code on a JSONP error?
[09:27:35] <Brodingo> "When data is retrieved from remote servers (which is only possible using the script or jsonp data types), the error callbacks and global events will never be fired."
[09:28:06] <salentinux> Hi guys, in my project i have a plugin to show a preloader on each image. The problem is that I don't want to call the plugin function each time I add image via for example an ajax query. Is there a way to set a "live" behaviour"?
[09:29:39] <snollux> nFFF: sure thing, but there's not gonna be any actual images there to swap through so it won't look like anything except raw code..
[09:30:29] <m1r0> Can anyone explain why adding this code makes my page load very slowly or not at all? http://pastebin.com/vyDrA466
[09:31:03] <YourA1gebra> afternoon, all.
[09:31:39] <YourA1gebra> having a bit of trouble with data tables and clicking events. I'd like to click the 7th column to load a report, but the only row that works is the first… http://pastebin.com/8K2TfqTa assuming this is due to not having the index of the tr?
[09:31:51] <NackNick> has anyone here used the infinate scroll script? I am having some what of a problem with it
[09:32:10] <YourA1gebra> if i change the first line to this.$('tr').click( function () {…. it works, but every td will load the report
[09:32:13] <timwis> Brodingo: The jquery-jsonp plugin fires the error event https://github.com/jaubourg/jquery-jsonp
[09:32:14] <snollux> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/FAUFy/ thanks :D
[09:32:28] <Brodingo> cool
[09:32:56] <NackNick> im trying to get new post to go into their own wrappers but the thing stops after about 3-4 post loading up and says finished loading =/
[09:33:13] <timwis> But not the error code :/
[09:38:36] <mmanrique> YourAlgebra, you're right, the query is just seleccting the first 7th column
[09:39:43] <YourA1gebra> mmanrique: how would I get the tr
[09:40:09] <YourA1gebra> I couldn't just use this.$('tr td').eq(6).click
[09:40:24] <mmanrique> no, that's not going to work
[09:40:30] <YourA1gebra> so I'm somewhat at a loss right now. looking into nth-child
[09:40:37] <mmanrique> can't you set a class to those td's?
[09:41:01] <mmanrique> and query the class name?
[09:41:15] <YourA1gebra> hmmm
[09:41:30] <YourA1gebra> i was just hoping that there would be an elegant solution to this
[09:41:54] <mg983> Hi all, I am trying to capture all clicks of a wrap id (#wrap), except if the user clicks on a child with a class "do-not-alert") -- is there an easy way to do this? see jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3GDN6/
[09:41:59] <jrajav> It's $(something).find('tr td') to get descendants, not $(something).$('tr td')
[09:42:02] <jrajav> @YourA1gebra:
[09:42:14] <YourA1gebra> jrajav: ah
[09:42:28] <YourA1gebra> jrajav: i don't know if that would work in this case either way
[09:42:31] <ravenzz> YourA1gebra what actually is this?
[09:42:36] <jrajav> Probably not
[09:43:08] <ravenzz> this.$('td').eq(6) ?
[09:43:27] <YourA1gebra> ravenzz: that will only work for the first row
[09:43:36] <YourA1gebra> is there a way to use that as an if statement?
[09:43:38] <ravenzz> ok but what is "this" ?
[09:43:39] <ravenzz> ..
[09:43:41] <YourA1gebra> oh
[09:43:43] <YourA1gebra> it's a table
[09:43:45] <YourA1gebra> data table
[09:44:01] <YourA1gebra> http://www.datatables.net/
[09:44:02] <ravenzz> is it a jQuery object?
[09:44:13] <YourA1gebra> just a table
[09:44:16] <YourA1gebra> html table
[09:44:34] <ravenzz> is its content dynamically generated/appended?
[09:44:41] <YourA1gebra> yes
[09:44:51] <YourA1gebra> not hard coded, getting loaded via db
[09:44:56] <ravenzz> so .click() won't work
[09:45:14] <ravenzz> you should go with event delegation (read on())
[09:46:18] <jrajav> mg983: http://jsfiddle.net/3GDN6/1/
[09:46:25] <ravenzz> do you want to bind to the 7th td of each row?
[09:46:40] <mg983> jrajav <3 thanks
[09:46:43] <YourA1gebra> an action that will load the appropriate folder
[09:46:52] <mmanrique> ravenzz, that's right
[09:46:56] <jrajav> mg983: Note that this will also not alert for something with a class name that contains the string "do-not-alert"
[09:47:09] <jrajav> mg983: This is unlikely to be a practical issue
[09:47:10] <mg983> yes that was the point
[09:47:25] <jrajav> mg983: Right, but say you add a new class foodo-not-alertblah
[09:47:37] <jrajav> I'm just letting you know this is a nonperfect general solution
[09:47:43] <mg983> yup, that's fine
[09:47:46] <jrajav> In general you would want to split the className by \s+
[09:48:12] <jrajav> And check the elements of the resulting array
[09:48:30] <mg983> \s+ is regex for what?
[09:49:08] <jeffsmykil> Has anyone used bootstrap and handlebars together before?  I can't seem to bind an event when the Id is created with a template
[09:49:11] <jeffsmykil> im using .on
[09:49:25] <mmanrique> YourAlgebra, have you tried using this.('td').filter(function(index) {.....}).click(....)
[09:50:28] <YourA1gebra> mmanrique: I haven't
[09:50:32] <YourA1gebra> i'll google up how to use that
[09:50:57] <mmanrique> mg983: \s+ means "a whitespace or more"
[09:51:01] <jrajav> mg983: \s is a whitespace character
[09:51:09] <jrajav> mg983: + means one or more of the preceding thing
[09:51:38] <jrajav> 'a b'.split(/s+/) --> ['a', 'b']
[09:52:03] <jrajav> *\s
[09:52:20] <YourA1gebra> never mind, i got it
[09:52:23] <YourA1gebra> thanks!
[09:52:35] <YourA1gebra> solution was to add a class to the td
[09:52:40] <mmanrique> so, how what did you do at the end?
[09:52:44] <YourA1gebra> then do something like this:  this.$('td.loadRpt').click(function(){
[09:53:02] <YourA1gebra> that's all I had to really change
[09:53:36] <mmanrique> YourAlgebra,  I told you that before :D
[09:53:42] <YourA1gebra> i know :X
[09:53:43] <YourA1gebra> lol
[09:53:56] <YourA1gebra> and i was still trying it as suggestions rolled in lol
[09:54:00] <mmanrique> :D
[09:54:02] <mmanrique> nice :)
[09:55:14] <snollux> any ideas?
[09:55:54] <mmanrique> snollux, what was your question again?
[09:56:36] <tobiasmu1ksch> Hey guys. I've got a problem. I'm using jQuery 1.8.2. I want to react to a focusout event and reset the foucs to that element under special conditions. Now i got this really simple codesnippet which gets caught in a loop in safari and I don't get it why this happens... Maybe you can help me, here's a really simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/ds38v/2/  Just try clicking into the input-box and leave it again.
[09:56:44] <snollux> "I need some tips on "animation" within JQuery -- here not referring to effects, but to rapidly switching out images. Right now my code is very sloppy and bad and depressing, and I know there must be a better way.   http://jsfiddle.net/FAUFy/ " mmanrique
[09:57:26] <aghouseh> can someone lend some insight to this problem? ive got a jquery bind event that is being attached outside of my control that I want to intercept its click and either allow or disallow it. im attempting it using addEventHandler but im not getting it working.. http://jsfiddle.net/nH7Zz/3/
[09:57:54] <tlkr> What don't you like about it snollux ? I would say you should probably define all the <img> tags and hide them with css and then just toggle visibility to increase smoothness.
[09:58:26] <jeffsmykil> #bootstrap
[10:00:01] <mmanrique> i agree with tlkr, otherwise you have loading problems, right?
[10:01:20] <relipse> how do i specify a <label> ONLY with a for= attribute?
[10:01:22] <snollux> tlkr: good idea. I don't know, I just thought it seemed like there could be a smarter way to do it
[10:01:31] <snollux> or more elegant one-line kind of deal
[10:01:34] <snollux> but I guess that'll work
[10:03:06] <snollux> tlkr: if I use the toggle-visibility thing, I could use the .animate() function for that, right? And if so, is there some sort of way to "lock" things down (i.e. other animations, other .click() events) while the animation is running?
[10:04:22] <snollux> one problem I had, when I was doing multiple versions of these, was doing any kind of mutex/locking. If someone were to click again while the animation was running, it'd start over or overlay, or if they clicked another one it'd just mess up. I tried doing some boolean "locks" but ended up getting deadlocked
[10:06:49] <jeffsmykil> snollux: thats what I do
[10:06:54] <jeffsmykil> i set a global var
[10:07:01] <jeffsmykil> to lock all of the animations
[10:07:09] <jeffsmykil> and do an if statement at the begining of each
[10:07:19] <snollux> and call-back to release the lock?
[10:07:30] <jeffsmykil> yeah i just put it right after the if
[10:07:39] <jeffsmykil> if it is unlocked then lock and do this
[10:07:45] <jeffsmykil> it feels hacky admitedly
[10:07:49] <jeffsmykil> but it has worked for me
[10:09:00] <jeffsmykil> snollux: I would love to know if there was a better way
[10:12:10] <tlkr> snollux, http://jsfiddle.net/WHkNr/2/
[10:12:40] <tlkr> I didn't test that
[10:17:25] <snollux> thanks tlkr
[10:37:30] <rightnow> If i do $('.myDiv').html(html);    can i somehow have a callback that triggers when the above code is done?
[10:37:49] <rightnow> Right now my other code triggers at the same time, which means i get some weird results.
[10:38:07] <rightnow> Its like a slight sligt ms delay
[10:42:21] <juboba> can I set the rules of my validation in the html tag instead of using the rules in the plugin?
[10:42:51] <juboba> I mean: <input type="text" name="some" rules="max:0; min"
[10:43:00] <juboba> I mean: <input type="text" name="some" rules="max:10; min:0"/>
[10:44:11] <fission6> how would i select divs which contains a few divs and within a specific div (found by class) contains a link
[10:44:24] <mmanrique> rightnow: take a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1773875/jquery-html-callback
[10:44:50] <mmanrique> if you're loading from an url you might use load() instead
[10:45:09] <mmanrique> http://api.jquery.com/load/#callback-function
[10:48:04] <Horriblist> no one needs help?
[10:48:12] <Horriblist> go figure we made it too easy
[10:51:11] <rindolf> Hi all.

[11:20:04] <Horriblist> then how does a phone plan cost $80 / month

[11:21:29] <systemfault> Apple still have Jonathan Ive...
[11:22:11] <NodeX> that's expensive
[11:22:15] <Horriblist> what about those 100$ hdmi cables im sure many ppl bought
[11:22:17] <NodeX> mine is like 20
[11:22:27] <Horriblist> that cost 1.99$
[11:22:54] <systemfault> Horriblist: Screwing up people who think that HDMI is analog
[11:23:03] <Horriblist> lol
[11:23:24] <Horriblist> im not sure if anyone is home upstairs
[11:23:34] <Hapzz> hello, i load different pages with ajax, and 2 of these pages have the same $(document).on('click', 'a') [example] in them
[11:23:49] <Hapzz> so it basically gets executed multiple times when the user switches between pages
[11:23:56] <Horriblist> argh stop using the .on syntax
[11:23:59] <Horriblist> so ugleh
[11:24:12] <Hapzz> i'd move it outside the ajax output, but each page needs different stuff done on it
[11:24:22] <Hapzz> any ideas?
[11:24:23] <Horriblist> Hapzz: no!
[11:24:33] <Horriblist> its everytime you click anywhere on page
[11:24:45] <Hapzz> i know that.
[11:24:56] <NodeX> Happz : use off() or bind it when the doc loads
[11:25:26] <Hapzz> NodeX it's bound when the doc loads, but then another page is loaded (with ajax) so basically there are 2 .on()s for that a
[11:25:43] <Horriblist> jesus
[11:25:53] <Horriblist> welcome to game prgramming
[11:26:17] <Hapzz> NodeX when would i use off()? right before the on(), to disable all previous .on()s?
[11:26:20] <NodeX> Hapzz : removce it from the other paghe - simples
[11:26:22] <Hapzz> Horriblist wtf do you want
[11:26:32] <Hapzz> NodeX i need it in the other page, too
[11:26:34] <Horriblist> i help u!
[11:26:48] <Hapzz> Horriblist you don't really
[11:26:58] <Horriblist> Hapzz: what do you need maybe there is a better way
[11:27:07] <NodeX> Hapzz : save yourself some troubles and write the code in a more efficient way
[11:27:12] <Horriblist> yes
[11:27:19] <Hapzz> NodeX i'd love to hear your suggestions.
[11:27:39] <Horriblist> explain what ur trying to do
[11:27:47] <Hapzz> 2 pages, the user switches between them with an ajax call.
[11:27:55] <Horriblist> ok
[11:27:59] <Hapzz> both of the pages have a.filter links
[11:28:10] <naquad> i'm trying to prevent dblclick default action (select text) from live() handler, i see handler running and returning false, but text is still selected. what am i doing wrong?
[11:28:11] <Hapzz> each page needs different stuff done on a click for a.filter
[11:28:18] <NodeX> why is the second page load it if the first page already has it?
[11:28:40] <Hapzz> because it has different content in the .on()
[11:28:44] <mmanrique> so, when you're loading a page, you're also loading some behavior that changes the current page (page that loads)
[11:28:58] <Horriblist> Hapzz: then you need to have 2 ons
[11:29:06] <Hapzz> Horriblist i don't, because then they conflict.
[11:29:12] <Horriblist> so make a var
[11:29:27] <Horriblist> that will keep track of the page ur on
[11:29:31] <Hapzz> if you go between the pages 10 times, you will have 10 active .on()s
[11:29:39] <Horriblist> no!
[11:29:45] <Horriblist> just relax and use ur head
[11:29:46] <Hapzz> don't no! me, it is.
[11:30:01] <Hapzz> Horriblist i don't want to have indefinite amount of .on()s
[11:30:06] <Hapzz> infinite even
[11:30:13] <Horriblist> then make another var
[11:30:27] <systemfault> He must be doing something hackish...
[11:30:34] <Hapzz> systemfault not at all
[11:30:42] <Hapzz> using .pjax to load different pages
[11:30:43] <Horriblist> no he just doesnt know how to keep track of states
[11:30:51] <Hapzz> Horriblist explain please.
[11:31:23] <systemfault> The guy who invented the term pjax should suffer.
[11:31:33] <Hapzz> systemfault "defunkt".
[11:31:40] <Horriblist> ooooh <3 pjax
[11:31:46] <Hapzz> "pjax = pushState + ajax"
[11:31:49] <Horriblist> i invented the term newjax
[11:31:57] <Horriblist> 10 yrs ago
[11:32:09] <Horriblist> before jquery came out
[11:32:09] <systemfault> Not sure how we can still keep the X
[11:32:27] <NoiseEee> back in the city
[11:32:29] <NoiseEee> newjax city
[11:32:34] <Hapzz> cmon people. ideas?
[11:32:37] <systemfault> Pxhr would already be better :)
[11:32:41] <Hapzz> i must be missing something stupid
[11:32:55] <Horriblist> Hapzz: jsfiddle
[11:33:02] <Horriblist> or gtfo
[11:33:07] <Hapzz> wtf jsfiddle
[11:33:16] <BLeg> .......
[11:33:22] <Hapzz> jsfiddle won't do ajax page switching
[11:33:44] <systemfault> I'm just not sure how replacing the markup of a container is going to reload his scripts.
[11:34:02] <Hapzz> replace the content of a <script> with ajax - .on()s stay between loads - multiple .on()s on the page for the same elements
[11:34:12] <Horriblist> he just needs to make a variable for which page he is on
[11:34:23] <Horriblist> then he can do some logic w it
[11:34:31] <Hapzz> Horriblist that would still leave shitloads of .on()s active in the same page.
[11:34:32] <Horriblist> in the single .on func
[11:34:38] <Horriblist> no BRO!
[11:34:41] <Hapzz> YES BRO
[11:34:42] <Horriblist> relax
[11:34:53] <Horriblist> r u stupid bro?
[11:35:02] <Hapzz> dafuq is wrong with you
[11:35:20] <Horriblist> im gona slap u
[11:35:25] <BLeg> how about we love
[11:35:26] <Hapzz> i load a new page every time with ajax, ok so far?
[11:35:37] <Horriblist> its not a page
[11:35:42] <Horriblist> its a container
[11:35:45] <Hapzz> yeah, so be it
[11:35:52] <Hapzz> part of the container is the <script> part, ok so far?
[11:35:53] <Horriblist> so....
[11:36:06] <Hapzz> inside the <script>, there's an .on(). ok so far?
[11:36:14] <systemfault> Hapzz: If you have scripts in your container... that's where is your problem.
[11:36:15] <Horriblist> you are overdoing it
[11:36:23] <Horriblist> why is he overdoing it
[11:36:32] <Hapzz> systemfault i need different scripts for different pages
[11:36:38] <Horriblist> then load them
[11:36:43] <Horriblist> w .load
[11:37:13] <Hapzz> this is what .pjax is doing
[11:37:29] <Hapzz> but the .on() from the PREVIOUS is still active
[11:37:36] <Hapzz> even after the page is changed with new content
[11:37:49] <Hapzz> the new content ALSO has an .on() in it, for the same selectors
[11:37:51] <Hapzz> = conflict
[11:37:52] <Hapzz> you get it now?
[11:39:06] <Horriblist> he is not doing it rite
[11:39:10] <Horriblist> amirite?
[11:39:58] <Horriblist> re Scope your project
[11:40:42] <Horriblist> this is a classic case of non programmers progamming
[11:41:48] <mmanrique> we're here not to question how good a programmer is, try to be constructive, k?
[11:42:04] <Horriblist> and then they h8 me
[11:42:04] <snollux> lol what's going on here
[11:43:01] <snollux> don't stress, just the other day I did something really dumb where I put "margin:none;" in my CSS and couldn't figure out what was wrong for like 10 min
[11:43:15] <snollux> realized it was meant to be 0px or 0em
[11:43:59] <systemfault> You don't need to specify the unit when it's 0
[11:44:10] <systemfault> margin: 0; /* valid */
[11:44:14] <Horriblist> OH YEAH!?
[11:44:16] <Horriblist> :O
[11:44:40] <systemfault> Think of all those bytes you can save LOLOLO!!!!
[11:44:50] <systemfault> But yeah... it's like that.
[11:44:57] <snollux> yeah I know, but "none" won't work, ever
[11:44:59] <snollux> and I forgot :(
[11:45:08] <Horriblist> i kno but im anal
[11:45:10] <mmanrique> the whole situation makes me remember this http://www.collegehumor.com/video/3980096/we-didnt-start-the-flame-war
[11:45:11] <naeluh> Hi can someone check why div is fading on page load and not fading when the  div is displayed completely I want it to fade when it is displayed complete on the page
[11:45:19] <Horriblist> i want everythig to look the same
[11:45:20] <naeluh> here is my code and http://pastie.org/5612587
[11:45:47] <naeluh> it is on this site if in services section
[11:46:16] <naeluh> http://theconfluencegroup.com/new_site3/#b
[11:46:35] <naeluh> that is where the div is it just completely fades on page load
[11:47:41] <naeluh> i got the code from jsfiddle where it works correctly
[11:49:06] <naeluh> but in my site it doesn't wait for the div to appear it just fades immediately
[11:49:34] <Horriblist> this is not your code?
[11:51:50] <naeluh> Horriblist: no its not  I got it from stackoverflow
[11:52:12] <naeluh> Horriblist: I am trying to adapt it to my site
[11:53:39] <mmanrique> naeluh: I see a div that says "slide" is that the div you mean?
[11:54:19] <naeluh> mmanrique: thanks its actually the one .hideme
[11:55:47] <andrew9184> anyone know how i can call the method on this plugin
[11:55:48] <andrew9184> http://jsfiddle.net/D9JSQ/2/
[11:55:55] <mmanrique> naeluh: yip, the one that says "slide"
[12:01:19] <andrew9184> anyone know ?
[12:04:42] <naeluh> mmanrique: yeah is there anyway to get that one to fade when it is completely displayed and not on page load ?
[12:04:46] <RohanBhangui> hi guys
[12:04:47] <RohanBhangui> http://pastie.org/5612655
[12:04:59] <RohanBhangui> i was wondering what the issue with that snippet of code is
[12:05:07] <RohanBhangui> what it is suppose to do
[12:05:19] <RohanBhangui> is get a select option
[12:05:33] <RohanBhangui> and get the value which is stored in teacherSelected
[12:05:42] <anew> well you have a lot of code missing then
[12:05:43] <anew> where is the rest
[12:05:53] <RohanBhangui> some of ti contains php
[12:06:02] <RohanBhangui> hold on let me make a fiddle
[12:06:03] <anew> and where the hell is the url
[12:06:27] <RohanBhangui> i read on a forum if you are refering to php code on smae page
[12:06:29] <RohanBhangui> you dont need url
[12:06:31] <naeluh> mmanrique:  I am wondering what is causing to run the animate on page load and on display thanks again for your help
[12:07:32] <anew> wut
[12:07:33] <b-ot> This is the internet, proof of it didn't.
[12:07:56] <anew> referring to php code on same page? i never heard of that, unless someone else has i would put the url in there
[12:08:10] <RohanBhangui> anew: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/fTMJr/
[12:09:08] <RohanBhangui> i doubt you will be able to "run" the code
[12:09:43] <anew> what are u getting for teacherSelected in console
[12:10:16] <RohanBhangui> the entire home.php code
[12:10:25] <RohanBhangui> which is the html that you see
[12:10:51] <NoiseEee> !php @ RohanBhangui
[12:10:56] <anew> wut
[12:10:56] <b-ot> Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[12:11:13] <anew> you should be getting a value for teacherChooser
[12:11:30] <anew> if you're not then noiseEee is right this is not php... view source and is the drop down filled out properly?
[12:11:40] <anew> you should be posting html here
[12:11:41] <anew> not php
[12:11:43] <anew> in the first box
[12:11:57] <RohanBhangui> the php is part of the problem unfortunately :(
[12:12:04] <anew> well then you need to fix the php !
[12:12:06] <anew> this is jquery !
[12:12:07] <anew> lol
[12:12:46] <RohanBhangui> okay but from what you see there is no problem with the snippet i showed you (other than the url)
[12:13:28] <anew> not that i see... but fix the php, get the html working, then make sure your getting a value (and not undefined) for teacherChooser
[12:13:39] <anew> once you have a value for that, send the ajax request and see what the response is
[12:14:35] <RohanBhangui> okay.....
[12:14:43] <RohanBhangui> i have narrowed it down to
[12:14:58] <RohanBhangui> that snippet
[12:15:27] <RohanBhangui> becuase before the val of of teacherChooser is proper and then it gets messed up
[12:15:30] <RohanBhangui> thanks anyways :)
[12:17:13] <anew> how is that possible, if you just told me the php is bad also
[12:18:49] <reecefowell> a friend once showed me a way to do $('something').find('div').find('div') in a single selector, how do i do that?
[12:19:27] <reecefowell> would be something like $('div childdiv anotherChild')
[12:19:39] <syborg> reecefowell: yes
[12:20:41] <reecefowell> hmmm actually in this instance its not a child element i need, but one in the same parent as the main selector
[12:21:53] <reecefowell> i suppose i could do $('input#something_unique').next('ul').find('li').each() but is there a more concise way to express that?
[12:22:15] <NoiseEee> reecefowell: yeah, drop the input before #something_unique
[12:22:34] <reecefowell> ok, but no way to express the next part in there too?
[12:22:49] <reecefowell> no biggie if not
[12:22:59] <NoiseEee> reecefowell: otherwise $('#somethingUnique ul li') should give you the li's in the UL of #somethingUnique, assuming there is only one ul
[12:23:06] <NoiseEee> otherwise it will give you back all the lis from all the uls
[12:23:21] <syborg> reecefowell: maybe try $('#something_unique ul:first li').each()
[12:23:24] <leetercola> what is the correct way to attach a global handler to jsonp .ajax requests?
[12:23:54] <reecefowell> syborg that could be it, let me try :)
[12:23:55] <leetercola> $(document).ajaxComplete(function(event,request,setting){}) does not trigger
[12:24:06] <slingle> what is the best way to handle mouse events inside a jQuery plugin
[12:24:20] <ryannielson> Anyone have any recommendations for thumbnail viewer plugins? Basically looking for something that's quick, with no licence restrictions. Ideally keyboard control for going through all images would be nice as well,
[12:25:10] <syborg> leetercola: Global callback functions are ajaxStart(), .ajaxStop(), .ajaxComplete(), .ajaxError(), .ajaxSuccess(), .ajaxSend()
[12:26:21] <leetercola> syborg: api for global callback functions state that jsonp requests don't trigger global events, is there a way around this?
[12:29:11] <syborg> leetercola: if thats the case then you'll probably have to use ajaxPrefilter to set an onComplete function
[12:29:21] <syborg> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[12:30:02] <reecefowell> this ended up doing what i needed in the end $('input.select2_taggable').next('ul').find('li').each()
[12:30:05] <leetercola_> syborg: sorry my nick didn't authenticate
[12:30:18] <reecefowell> syborg: thanks for the help :)
[12:32:55] <GoodHeart007> Heya,  is there anyone available to help me figure out a simply jquery question?
[12:33:38] <systemfault> Just ask.
[12:39:05] <GoodHeart007> k thx,  just composing an example to ask with
[12:39:30] <sethetter> Am I wrong in thinking that jQuery UI's dialog creates a copy of the dialog div when it's made visible?
[12:43:09] <Horriblist> no
[12:51:57] <GoodHeart007> Hope i dont get kicked for flooding...
[12:52:04] <GoodHeart007> New to Jquery; I'm building a wordpress site and I'm listing store locations on a certain page.
[12:52:16] <GoodHeart007> My php looper outputs the stores (which are saved as posts) in a:
[12:52:16] <GoodHeart007> <div id="content">
[12:52:16] <GoodHeart007> 	<article id="store-001">
[12:52:16] <GoodHeart007> 		<header class="store-header">Name</header>
[12:52:16] <GoodHeart007> 		<div class="store-content">address and info</div>
[12:52:16] <GoodHeart007> 		<footer class="store-metadata">meta data</div>
[12:52:16] <GoodHeart007> 	</article>
[12:52:17] <GoodHeart007> 	<article id="store-002">…. Repeats structure above</article>
[12:52:17] <GoodHeart007> </div>
[12:52:28] <Pilate> !shiton GoodHeart007
[12:52:38] <GoodHeart007> I want to hide the "store-content" and "store-metadata " for each post, so that a neat list consisting of only the headers are seen when the page loads.
[12:52:55] <GoodHeart007> When a user clicks on a header, I would like the details ("store-content" and "store-metadata ") to slide down.
[12:53:06] <syborg> GoodHeart007: wow, please use jsfiddle, pastbin, something...
[12:53:11] <Pilate> pasting code and ignoring the topic is the quickest way to ignore
[12:53:13] <GoodHeart007> k
[12:53:17] <Pilate> in every channel
[12:53:35] <andrewSC> hi all
[12:53:51] <andrewSC> I was wondering, do click events go into a queue?
[12:54:40] <syborg> andrewSC: in a sense yes.
[12:54:44] <andrewSC> i'm seeing some very odd behavior where if i click on one element then click on another element, and .submit() on this second element, the first element's data is what's used, not the second
[12:54:56] <andrewSC> syborg: gotcha
[12:54:58] <syborg> there is no multi-threading in js if that is what you're asking
[12:55:18] <andrewSC> mmmmm i knew that but I think i know where you're coming from
[12:55:27] <Schrostfutz> hey guys, i was just wondering when i print a integer, is there a function to add trailing 0s?
[12:55:57] <andrewSC> I'm real sure what to do here
[12:56:01] <andrewSC> mmmmm
[12:56:25] <andrewSC> submit is called twice but only the first submit() persists?
[12:56:34] <andrewSC> err
[12:56:38] <andrewSC> let me double check that
[12:57:10] <andrewSC> yeahhh
[12:57:14] <syborg> Schrostfutz: have you tried toFixed?
[12:57:48] <syborg> andrewSC: why are two different submits being called to begin with?
[12:57:55] <Schrostfutz> syborg, nope, not yet
[12:57:56] <phiz> Schrostfutz: there's the toFixed() method
[12:58:11] <GoodHeart007> sorry, i'm new to irc too... http://pastebin.com/zFkkEyUL
[12:58:12] <phiz> ahh syborg said that already
[12:58:23] <andrewSC> syborg: good question.
[12:58:36] <Schrostfutz> okay, thanks i will use that
[12:58:38] <andrewSC> that's why i was wondering about the click event queuing
[12:58:43] <andrewSC> hmmmm
[12:58:55] <andrewSC> it's weird
[12:59:33] <andrewSC> like executing .submit() on the second element after the first element was clicked, but not .submit() causes the first and second elements to call .submit
[12:59:54] <andrewSC> that made no sense
[12:59:56] <andrewSC> let me rephrase
[13:00:17] <phiz> Schrostfutz: just tested and it works.  var num = 10; var numdec = num.toFixed(2);
[13:02:04] <Schrostfutz> toFixed doesnt work for me, it adds two decimal places
[13:02:15] <Schrostfutz> i want it to return 07 for 7 etc
[13:03:33] <Horriblist> you need strpad
[13:09:32] <Schrostfutz> Horriblist: thanks
[13:09:52] <Horriblist> i was rite?
[13:10:38] <Schrostfutz> i looked for pad and found a short function on stackoverflow i just copied =)
[13:15:41] <GoodHeart007> anyone able to provide input on my question? thx.
[13:20:27] <Dave_Stein> hey are there any Adobe guys in here by chance?
[13:21:41] <misteroneill> GoodHeart007: $(this).siblings().slideDown();
[13:27:01] <GoodHeart007> k thanks ill try it
[13:31:22] <Dave_Stein> Well because of the silence, does anyone know if Adobe is still active with jQ mobile?
[13:36:31] <ionico> hi
[13:36:34] <GoodHeart007> misteroneill: Beautiful! Thanks so much.. i knew you gurus would have a quick answer for me.  Happy New Year!
[13:36:58] <ionico> how can i send two variables? i'm newbie
[13:37:00] <ionico> data: "cono="+ usr,
[13:37:34] <ionico> can i do something like data: "cono="+ usr&cono2="+ usr2 ?
[13:39:10] <mmanrique> ionico: data: { "cono" :usr , "cono2" : usr2}
[13:39:25] <misteroneill> GoodHeart007: you're welcome :)
[13:41:07] <mmanrique> ionico: which method are you using to send data?
[13:42:47] <Woet> I really have no idea why http://inceptionhosting.com/ is not working
[13:42:55] <Woet> i see the obvious errors
[13:42:59] <Woet> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'superfish'
[13:43:00] <Woet> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'ajaxForm'
[13:43:19] <Woet> but both those methods are defined in their respective .js files and loading
[13:45:03] <ionico> method is post
[13:45:29] <NoiseEee> Woet: i'd be more concerned about what those methods are trying to apply to; ie: whatever Object [object Object] is
[13:45:58] <Woet> NoiseEee: hm fair enough
[13:46:15] <relipse> in jqueryui, how do I change a dialog button text on the bottom dynamically?
[13:46:18] <mmanrique> ionico: yeah, you can set the data like this
[13:46:18] <mmanrique> $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[13:48:26] <Woet> NoiseEee: they are simple HTML elements
[13:48:37] <Woet> NoiseEee: for example, jQuery('#login-holder a').fancybox(); - Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fancybox'
[13:48:48] <Woet> NoiseEee: <div id="login-holder"> <a href="#login-box" class="sml-btn green">Client Login</a> </div>
[13:50:23] <ionico> mmanrique so i have to delete the data: "cono="+ usr,
[13:50:35] <ionico> and place all in type: "POST",
[13:50:39] <ionico> ?
[13:51:00] <misteroneill> Woet: Object [object Object] is a jquery collection, so what it's saying is that there is no jquery method "fancybox" available (i.e. the plugin is not included on the page)
[13:51:15] <Woet> misteroneill: which is my entire issue because it is available
[13:51:21] <mmanrique> ionico: do you have any code on pastebin so that I can see how your using the post method?
[13:51:23] <Woet> it's loaded before the breakpoint
[13:51:52] <mmanrique> Woet: you sure? even after the page loads I run this: jQuery('ul.sf-menu').superfish and returns undefined
[13:52:04] <mmanrique> as if the method didn't exists
[13:52:04] <Woet> mmanrique: 100%,
[13:52:08] <Woet> mmanrique: <script src="http://inceptionhosting.com/wp-content/themes/Phenomenon/js/superfish.js"></script>
[13:53:45] <misteroneill> Woet: on the line before trying to use fancybox, do a `console.log(typeof jQuery.fn.fancybox);` if it says "undefined" then it doesn't exist - if it says "function"… there's something really broken :)
[13:54:27] <ionico> here mmanrique http://pastebin.com/9sieT7kQ Line 19 how can i send two variables
[13:54:30] <Woet> misteroneill: it'll likely be undefined but I'll check
[13:54:41] <ionico> i need to send also variable year
[13:56:22] <mmanrique> ionico: change line 19 to data: {"cono": usr, "cono2": usr2, "year": year}
[13:56:49] <mmanrique> basically you'll be building a JSON object to represent the data you want it to be sent
[13:57:06] <bluesm> Is there jquery which do not support older browser?
[13:57:10] <bluesm> For the sake of performance ?
[13:58:17] <NoiseEee> bluesm: surely "old browser compatibility" is not affecting your current app at all in terms of "performance"
[13:58:23] <NoiseEee> what makes you think its an issue in any way?
[13:58:59] <bluesm> NoiseEee: I'm certain it is.
[13:59:14] <NoiseEee> what led you to that conclusion?
[13:59:41] <bluesm> NoiseEee: Checking if there method is available....
[13:59:59] <NoiseEee> what do you mean?
[14:00:03] <Woet> misteroneill: check the site again if you want
[14:00:20] <Woet> misteroneill: i've added console.log to superfish.js and fancybox.js, they both get triggered before the error
[14:00:23] <ionico> ok, letme try
[14:00:32] <Woet> misteroneill: then the console.log you recommended returns undefined and then the uncaught error
[14:02:11] <Woet> misteroneill: i have no idea what's going on
[14:02:40] <bluesm> NoiseEee: I think checking if the methods are available is wasting of time and performance.
[14:03:34] <NoiseEee> bluesm: i would bet my home that the method-checking is imperceptible, you should properly analyze your code to figure out the slowdown. It's not Jquery's compatibility for older browsers.
[14:04:20] <bluesm> NoiseEee: Probably you are right.
[14:04:23] <misteroneill> Woet: you're loading another copy of query (http://www.freeindex.co.uk/customscripts/js/jquery-1.6.4.min.js) which is clobbering your copy of jquery
[14:04:44] <bluesm> NoiseEee:  It is imperceptible. But I still don't understand who cares on IE 6 7 8 ...
[14:04:48] <Woet> misteroneill: i thought so!
[14:05:00] <Woet> in the beginning i thought it was loading multiple jquery which would reset the plugins
[14:05:02] <Woet> but i couldn't find it
[14:05:17] <NoiseEee> bluesm: understand thats half the friggin point of jquery, to make JS work on all older browsers.
[14:05:24] <Woet> thanks a lot
[14:05:40] <ajpiano> bluesm: jQuery 2.0 will not support IE 6 - 8
[14:06:39] <suppp> IE 6
[14:06:40] <suppp> shoo
[14:06:58] <bluesm> ajpiano: juupii!
[14:06:59] <suppp> btw fun fact . IE 6 is the main browser used in China :D
[14:07:12] <systemfault> IE8 is widely used... so anybody not-stupid care. (Unless it's for let's say.. an admin section of some website)
[14:07:14] <suppp> or at least mid 2012 last time i was there :O
[14:07:24] <systemfault> Who needs customers in china...
[14:07:28] <suppp> lol ?
[14:07:34] <bluesm>  suppp: So then Chinese  should do their own libraries to it.
[14:07:37] <suppp> i guess that 1.5 billion people don't matter :D
[14:07:48] <felix_> hi
[14:07:55] <suppp> china is THE market my friend :D
[14:07:56] <systemfault> suppp: 1.4999999 billions being poor and don't buy on the internet.
[14:08:16] <systemfault> There's a reason why they still use IE6...
[14:08:24] <suppp> systemfault : go to china . u'll see richer people there than in most countries. and the poor people ? THEY ALL BUY on the internet
[14:08:27] <systemfault> They cannot buy a good computer with a license.
[14:08:32] <bluesm> We shouldn't care. This behavior stops development of new standards ...

[14:09:06] <felix_> does someone know a jquery plugin to realize same like this: http://www.tmn-captivity.com/ when you hover over the teamspeak, facebook oder google plus button?
[14:09:11] <suppp> it's so easy to buy stuff over the internet in china. all use a QQ number ( i guess something like skype /facebook ) . and you can put cash on that QQ number on any internet cafe
[14:09:15] <Horriblist> try to separate my logic loop from the draw loop after the fact lol

[14:21:50] <work-boy> at night the Hilton right next to the convention center looks EXACTLY like an Alliance ship
[14:22:01] <naeluh> heres my code again http://pastie.org/5612587
[14:22:09] <drakythe> work-boy: hahaha, that'd be a site to see.
[14:22:17] <work-boy> pretty much
[14:22:25] <mmanrique> ionico: you should check the net tab (on chrome dev tools) to see what the request is sending
[14:22:30] <Horriblist> is hong kong more fun than china?
[14:22:35] <suppp> omg
[14:22:39] <suppp> hong kong is THE SHIT
[14:22:44] <work-boy> Horriblist, Macau baby

[14:22:55] <suppp> it's like western europe , but better from some perspective
[14:22:59] <Horriblist> im not down w the chinese rules
[14:23:03] <Horriblist> sounds dum
[14:23:07] <work-boy> suppp, is the shanghai sex convention still a thing?
[14:23:10] <suppp> most people speak english, they are all SOOOOO friendly , everything of high quality
[14:23:26] <Horriblist> china sounds uncivilized
[14:23:37] <suppp> i wasn't in shanghai actually , i was just beijing , deng feng ( shaolin ) and wu dang
[14:23:46] <work-boy> Horriblist, in some ways yes, in others western culture is
[14:24:01] <Lindrian> I have a textarea with several events bound to it. Problem is that they trigger several times. For example, I need to catch keyup/down, input and paste. If I paste something, 4 events will fire. Can this be fixed?
[14:24:02] <work-boy> so do you speak beijinghua or shanghaihua?
[14:24:06] <Horriblist> well wats up w blocking shit
[14:24:13] <work-boy> or do you just speak cantonese

[14:24:20] <Horriblist> its not even real
[14:24:25] <suppp> lots of sex u can buy in china, but other than beijing, u don't get much casual sex without paying for it so ... dunno ... i hear regular girls in shanghai are pretty closed
[14:24:32] <Horriblist> its a friken pictures and words

[14:25:09] <suppp> no mandarin in hong kong . i tried it , didnt go well , person eventually answered in english
[14:25:10] <work-boy> I was waiting for them to drop the hammer on that
[14:25:27] <work-boy> yeah, cantonese only in hongkong

[14:25:50] <suppp> probably is :)
[14:26:21] <Horriblist> fuk it im going to australia and equador
[14:26:22] <Zitter> when using drag & drop ui, can I leave a copy of element dragged, semi transparent, at starting point? As in google calendard when you drag events
[14:26:29] <drakythe> work-boy: considering the last CES had a vibrator that synced to your MP3 player, I'm not sure a dedicated sex convention is necessary...
[14:27:22] <work-boy> drakythe, there's a couple in vegas...
[14:27:28] <work-boy> dedicated exclusively to it
[14:27:38] <work-boy> I only mentioned it as chinese is so conservative
[14:27:52] <drakythe> work-boy: ah, well, thats vegas... lol
[14:29:11] <work-boy> case in point: photos from a three-way involving a ministry member resulted in him being charged with sex crimes
[14:29:28] <Horriblist> shiat
[14:29:43] <Horriblist> how cool are chinese with weed
[14:29:49] <work-boy> where are you Horriblist?
[14:29:58] <work-boy> weed may as well be crack in china my friend
[14:30:08] <Horriblist> ya see u wont find me in china
[14:30:21] <Horriblist> suk my lil donkey
[14:30:28] <suppp> i smoked some bud in china
[14:30:34] <shoky> me too
[14:30:37] <suppp> even tho it's death sentence for drugs lol
[14:30:42] <work-boy> while most western nations decriminalized it (Weed is illegal, but "drugs" are more illegal), most of asia I believe still has it as "drugs"
[14:30:46] <suppp> but i was in a kung fu school full of foreigners
[14:30:48] <shoky> if you want drugs in china go to a town called dali
[14:30:50] <suppp> so they had bud
[14:31:15] <Horriblist> thats too bad
[14:31:32] <suppp> but the police is kinda ... weird
[14:31:41] <Horriblist> considring bud is responsible for most of americas progress
[14:31:48] <Horriblist> progression
[14:31:53] <suppp> i saw an accident a scooter bumbed into a car. then the scooter driver just took off .
[14:32:08] <Horriblist> fuk
[14:32:12] <suppp> and as i was telling my buddy "man imagine if a cop would have seen him" . a cop car was driving right behind him
[14:32:16] <suppp> and the cops did nothing
[14:32:21] <suppp> too much paperwork
[14:32:22] <suppp> lol
[14:32:30] <Horriblist> watever
[14:32:58] <Horriblist> china sound bulshit
[14:33:04] <suppp> it's different
[14:33:11] <Horriblist> come to australia
[14:33:17] <Horriblist> much beta
[14:33:31] <Horriblist> hot chiks big waves
[14:33:34] <suppp> definently a nice experience, once you learn where to find seating toilets, and the restaurants which plug in their fridges :D
[14:33:44] <work-boy> I've friends in melbourne
[14:36:13] <Horriblist> lot of beach goers in china?
[14:36:47] <suppp> i havn't been near beaches . just hard core kung fu places and beijing
[14:37:01] <Horriblist> o
[14:41:37] <Horriblist> what about snoboarding any of that in china
[14:41:55] <suppp> probably
[14:42:22] <suppp> the thing with china is ... sometimes it comes off as very primitive ... but in fact it's growing quick . and starting to get ahead
[14:42:52] <suppp> for example their youtube alternatives, were selling pay per view movies long before netflixx or youtube
[14:43:18] <suppp> and from crappy appartments with no seating toilets ... now they build huge structures that look like UFO's
[14:44:26] <Horriblist> jesus
[14:45:00] <Horriblist> i heard they built a lot of huge empty cities
[14:45:11] <suppp> this railway station  http://www.stichtingmilieunet.nl/andersbekekenblog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/beijing_south-railway-station.jpg was 10 mins walking from a chinese ghetto where they had a public toilet servicing about 100 houses
[14:45:19] <ionico> is it posible something like this $("#var1" or "#var2").keyup  ??
[14:45:29] <ionico> how could be the sintaxis?
[14:45:49] <suppp> so give it 50 years ... and china will be the next US in terms of trends , infrastructure , etc
[14:45:52] <shoky> ionico: $('#id1, #id2')
[14:45:56] <bot-t> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of China is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[14:46:21] <suppp> aww bot blocked :(
[14:46:42] <shoky> why would you hide behind a bot to say that :\
[14:46:43] <Horriblist> y should i lol
[14:46:50] <m1r0> Can anyone explain why adding this code makes my page load very slowly or not at all? http://pastebin.com/vyDrA466
[14:47:04] <ionico> and in the case var2 is from a select menu ?
[14:48:16] <shoky> + is your friend
[14:51:14] <coder7of9> i have a hidden field which is set programatically. the field has an onchange handler but it does not trigger when the value is updated via js. is there an implicit way to trigger the fields onchange?
[14:53:10] <mmanrique> hidden fields and onchange don't get along well
[14:53:48] <mmanrique> change the value via js and the trigger the 'onchange' event
[14:54:08] <mmanrique> like $(
[14:54:36] <mmanrique> like $('selector).val('newvalue).change();
[14:54:46] <mmanrique> maybe that'll work, IDK xD
[14:54:47] <ionico> i want to do this $('#id1, #id2').keyup the problem is that #id2 is from a select and keyup wont work
[14:54:48] <coder7of9> thanks
[14:58:07] <ionico> i need a function to triger if a field is keyup or a select menu is changed
[14:58:25] <ionico> is it posible in the same $('#id1, #id2') ?
[15:01:33] <m1r0> How come adding this line: " <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>" to my html makes my page load super slowly
[15:03:42] <imsky> oh this is a glorious new year
[15:04:55] <suppp> m1r0 maybe your jquery code is bad somehow ?
[15:05:18] <m1r0> No, I'm not even running any jquery code, just referencing the library, and it's slowing it down a ton
[15:06:12] <m1r0> By putting the reference at the bottom of the code, it loads faster, but then it takes forevor to fully load
[15:06:32] <Eviltwin> Possibly some sort of caching issue or weird latency to that server
[15:06:47] <mmanrique> try changing it to another cdn
[15:06:48] <m1r0> It loads instantly when I put in the link
[15:06:48] <Eviltwin> I'd still try removing just that line to see if anything changes
[15:06:50] <suppp> m1r0 yea , i just copy pasted the exact line in my current project and no problems
[15:07:05] <m1r0> Eviltwin: I did, and it loads faster by a ton
[15:07:40] <m1r0> I've tried another cdn too
[15:07:43] <m1r0> still very slow
[15:07:50] <m1r0> I'm going to try a different browser
[15:08:09] <m1r0> loads instantly....
[15:08:11] <m1r0> on firefox
[15:08:13] <m1r0> but on chrome
[15:08:17] <m1r0> I'm going to clear my cache
[15:08:25] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you broke your browser
[15:08:38] <tlkr> m1r0, try adding http: to the start of your src.
[15:09:10] <m1r0> >.> still doing it
[15:09:24] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you broke your browser
[15:09:52] <suppp> yea look at your chrome , if FF is loading properly , and my project is loading properly on chrome , then everything points to your chrome
[15:10:12] <m1r0> Now it's half working sometimes
[15:10:19] <m1r0> lol
[15:10:19] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you broke your browser
[15:12:08] <Horriblist> omg u broke it
[15:12:14] <Horriblist> ?
[15:12:23] <Eviltwin> He broke Google
[15:14:21] <Horriblist> press power
[15:16:21] <mmanrique> m1ro: that's odd :(
[15:20:01] <suppp> call tech support
[15:20:07] <suppp> they will suggest you restart the computer
[15:21:44] <Horriblist> is ther a window near by?
[15:22:04] <Horriblist> you can throw it there
[15:22:39] <m1r0> It's fixed
[15:22:47] <m1r0> By adding the http:
[15:24:20] <m1r0> Does anyone know how to make it so the location of the input textboxes doesn't change whenever you resize the window?
[15:24:21] <m1r0> http://cssdeck.com/labs/full/7mnmi66l/0
[15:26:23] <JoeSlack> Lots of different ways,. depending on how you want to do it.
[15:26:54] <JoeSlack> You can listen on the resize event and assign css properties on event update
[15:27:16] <JoeSlack> or you can place your objects in a different way with js/css, using screen height / calc
[15:27:37] <m1r0> The second way is the way I probably want to do it
[15:28:07] <m1r0> but everytime I try to specify in a different way, it screws up the way the text boxes open up, the username one start opening to the right instead of the left
[15:28:57] <JoeSlack> oh, i think that probably has more to do with the framework(?) your using already for showing / hiding
[15:29:12] <JoeSlack> i usually write that stuff manually...  maybe someone more familiar with jquery plugins / out of box solutions can help u with that
[15:30:48] <JoeSlack> I'd personally use CSS3 transitions, and write my own handler.
[15:31:46] <m1r0> See, for some weird reason, when I change the float direction, it changes the direction the box goes
[15:31:54] <m1r0> this is more of a bug i'm exploiting then a feature
[15:32:04] <m1r0> but when I change the positioning time, it goes to hell
[15:38:41] <sacrebleu> hey folks, i'm trying to do this responsive thing where an image is centered and resized but i'm seeing some odd behavior, can anyone take a look and give me some feedback? http://kr-ak.com/
[15:39:20] <Horriblist> However, this will fall down when it comes to properties where the rate of change also changes over time, for example an accelerating vehicle. This can be resolved by using a more advanced integrator, such as "Verlet".
[15:39:24] <Horriblist> jfc
[15:39:27] <Horriblist> what the hell is a verlet
[15:40:08] <Horriblist> and all this time i was wondering why deltatime has weird results with acclelerations
[15:40:10] <sacrebleu> Verlet integration (French pronunciation: ?[v??'l?]) is a numerical method used to integrate Newton's equations of motion.
[15:40:28] <Horriblist> how am i suposed to find this verlet
[15:40:45] <sacrebleu> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration#Equations_of_motion
[15:41:00] <sacrebleu> In a Verlet simulation, you can rewind
[15:41:09] <Horriblist> is it possible to just lock it down?
[15:41:14] <sacrebleu> lock what down
[15:41:15] <Horriblist> like lock down the game rick
[15:41:18] <Horriblist> tick
[15:41:24] <sacrebleu> what do you mean
[15:41:35] <Horriblist> just only compute all game login at 30 fps
[15:41:41] <Horriblist> logic
[15:41:48] <sacrebleu> you mean to do real time physics?
[15:41:53] <Horriblist> yes
[15:41:55] <sacrebleu> you can use something callead a Runge Kutta Integrator if you'd like
[15:42:04] <sacrebleu> or you can use the simpler Euler method
[15:42:26] <Horriblist> same guy that did euler angles
[15:42:47] <sacrebleu> Euler (Oilers)
[15:42:47] <imsky> you guys
[15:43:07] <sacrebleu> It means rotation A, rotation B really
[15:44:02] <Horriblist> so locking down everything to 30 fps wont work?
[15:44:10] <sacrebleu> what are you talking about man
[15:44:13] <sacrebleu> what are you trying to do
[15:44:14] <Horriblist> not fps but logic ticks
[15:44:38] <Horriblist> wel since deltatime doesnt work for accelerations
[15:44:43] <tlkr> Horriblist, I have no idea what you are talking about either.
[15:44:53] <sacrebleu> Yeah what the hell are you trying to DOOOOO MAAAAANN
[15:45:04] <sacrebleu> tlkr can you look @ kr-ak.com and tell me what i'm doing wrong
[15:46:02] <sacrebleu> horriblist, if you lock things at a certain expected framerate, problems will occur when frames do not render fast enough
[15:46:06] <Horriblist> sounds like you guys know what youretalking about
[15:46:15] <sacrebleu> however, most games do that
[15:46:18] <Horriblist> why not understand my question
[15:46:25] <sacrebleu> because statement not question
[15:46:34] <sacrebleu> not enough info
[15:46:48] <Horriblist> how can someone run less than 30 fos
[15:46:54] <tlkr> sacrebleu what are you trying to do?
[15:46:54] <Horriblist> ticks
[15:46:58] <sacrebleu> when calculations per frame exceed available CPU
[15:47:12] <sacrebleu> tlkr: I want kr-ak image to scale like roxik.com/cat
[15:47:18] <Horriblist> well then they need a faster com[
[15:47:29] <Horriblist> or stop dl pornz
[15:47:31] <sacrebleu> horriblist thus the need for minimum requirements
[15:47:41] <Horriblist> so its ok?
[15:47:50] <sacrebleu> yes, you set a "target framerate"
[15:47:55] <sacrebleu> and work within that
[15:48:09] <sacrebleu> or, you calculate a Verlet integration
[15:48:18] <Horriblist> because doing that verlet crap you said sound crazy
[15:48:19] <sacrebleu> and use the current time
[15:48:28] <Horriblist> yes im using time
[15:48:33] <sacrebleu> to calculate what
[15:48:54] <Horriblist> i have deltatime in all my shits
[15:49:04] <sacrebleu> so stop eating fig newtons
[15:49:10] <sacrebleu> if you are having problems with shits
[15:49:15] <Horriblist> but its breaking down on accelerated things
[15:49:19] <Horriblist> is what i noticed
[15:49:23] <sacrebleu> because you forgot to take pepto bismal
[15:49:42] <Horriblist> and i just confirmed it by reading this one article
[15:50:04] <sacrebleu> yes, i've read that one to "Diarrehea of the Mouth Common Problem for Horriblist"
[15:50:12] <sacrebleu> +o
[15:50:30] <Horriblist> your problem shithead
[15:50:32] <Horriblist> ?
[15:50:42] <sacrebleu> I think it's your problem with shits, not mine.
[15:51:14] <Horriblist> wow
[15:51:20] <Horriblist> ok dickhead
[15:51:30] <imsky> lolol
[15:51:48] <shoky> let's talk about china!
[15:52:00] <sacrebleu> those are MY ISLANDS shoky
[15:52:30] <shoky> well, keep them indoors
[15:52:40] <sacrebleu> my god you're right it's raining all over my deserts too!
[15:53:07] <Horriblist> ah here it is
[15:53:09] <Horriblist> Fixed Time Step Approach
[15:53:18] <Horriblist> i just didnt read it to the bottom
[15:53:29] <shoky> that must've been the problem
[15:54:50] <sacrebleu> majorly OT Horriblist
[15:54:58] <sacrebleu> hey guys can someone take a look at my site real quick?  I'm trying to get the image to stay centered and scaled within the window but something is mucked: http://kr-ak.com
[15:55:28] <Horriblist> sacrebleu: keep fapping donkey
[15:55:40] <sacrebleu> !mute
[15:55:53] <shoky> sacrebleu: what's that css on .resize for?
[15:56:03] <sacrebleu> shoky dunno i guess i could drop the class
[15:56:22] <sacrebleu> you'd need fixed I think
[15:56:55] <sacrebleu> it seems like the streams are crossed shoky, but i can't see where
[15:57:30] <shoky> i don't really know why you're doing all that stuff..
[15:57:40] <sacrebleu> so that its always centered in the window
[15:58:03] <sacrebleu> i must gtg
[15:58:06] <JoeSlack> but why aren't you just taking $(window).width() and image.width / 2?
[15:58:06] <sacrebleu> firewall going down
[15:58:07] <shoky> left:50%  is not centered..
[15:58:09] <Horriblist> learn html
[15:58:11] <sacrebleu> dunno
[15:58:12] <Horriblist> idiot
[15:58:22] <sacrebleu> brb
[15:58:22] <Horriblist> before helping me w game physics
[15:58:52] <Horriblist> glad he was able to google verlet for me
[15:59:42] <Horriblist> JoeSlack: cant he do it w margin auto too?
[16:04:46] <apple1004> Hi All,
[16:04:53] <m1r0> Does anyone know how to make a css animation go from right to left?
[16:04:54] <shoky> heh
[16:04:58] <shoky> he mixed up x and y
[16:05:12] <shoky> did top: x and left: y
[16:05:47] <Horriblist> so he is just a hater
[16:05:54] <Horriblist> ?
[16:06:02] <shoky> wat?
[16:06:02] <b-ot> Hi how to spot. Dear if possible you send me invitation magnanimous friendship because I sent you one and not the ways of my love and respect and kisses
[16:07:05] <sacrebleu> back sorry
[16:07:12] <shoky> sacrebleu: hi. you did top: x and left: y
[16:07:13] <shoky> ;]
[16:07:26] <sacrebleu> oh it should be top y and left x thanks
[16:07:35] <shoky> indeedy
[16:08:16] <sacrebleu> thanks!  fixed.
[16:08:32] <shoky> np
[16:11:48] <Horriblist> so it follows that in order to get exactly the same result (and I mean exact down to the floating point bits) it is necessary to use a fixed delta time value.
[16:12:02] <Horriblist> GOT IT
[16:12:25] <Horriblist> note to self
[16:21:09] <maxmahem> maybe a dumb question, but can I chain jquery selectors? IE can I do $(element.class).$(element2.class)? Should I?
[16:21:20] <rafaqueque> maxmahem
[16:21:31] <rafaqueque> you can use $(el1, el2, el3).()
[16:21:45] <rafaqueque> there's no need to chain them that way
[16:23:31] <maxmahem> rafaqueque: wouldn't that give me a selector for elements 31, 32, and e3? That's not what I want. What I want is an element thats a child of another element. Something more like $('e1 e2 e3').
[16:24:11] <maxmahem> I know I could use the children() function instead, but I was wondering if I could do it this way instead.
[16:26:42] <tlkr> maxmahem $('el1 > el2 > el3')
[16:26:42] <tlkr> that will work for direct children
[16:26:42] <tlkr> $('el1 el2 el3') will also work if they are not parent/child elements
[16:26:45] <tlkr> in a similar way to .find()
[16:26:59] <tlkr> you said it yourself above, might have been a good idea to try it
[16:27:36] <JoeSlack> always search with a scope!  Beware of crawling huge DOMs on mobile devices.
[16:28:09] <maxmahem> right. In this case though it's not very convient for me to use the regular selector again (it's stored in a var). So I was wondering if I could use the jquery selector $() again or if find/children was the way to go.
[16:28:54] <Horriblist> yes use children
[16:29:02] <tlkr> use children/find maxmahem
[16:29:29] <Horriblist> you gota think how jquery works too you know
[16:29:43] <Horriblist> like which way will be faster and eficient
[16:29:55] <maxmahem> hence my question :)
[16:30:09] <Horriblist> k bai
[16:30:26] <Tales1> wow.. i have a nice request... i need to enable a button during a specific time period and disable it after the MAX time has passed
[16:30:39] <Tales1> is it possible?
[16:30:39] <Horriblist> timeout
[16:39:09] <Boze> Q: I'm pulling a paragraph out of localStorage into a text area. Then I add another sentence to the paragraph. How do I go about just saving just the change? All i can think of is clear the localStorage first, but I was looking for more of a diff solution
[16:39:34] <Boze> so I don't end up saving the first paragraph twice
[16:39:56] <Horriblist> yeah that wont hapen
[16:40:07] <Horriblist> diff is a crazy algorythm
[16:40:24] <Horriblist> i actually coded up one
[16:40:28] <Horriblist> but its not that great
[16:40:30] <Boze> hmm
[16:40:55] <Horriblist> you can actually use svn or vim diff
[16:41:07] <Horriblist> but thats crazy rite?
[16:41:16] <Boze> heh over my head too
[16:41:36] <Horriblist> well its just not needed in your case
[16:41:44] <Horriblist> diff is for highliting changes etc
[16:42:25] <Boze> so do ya think just clearing the localStorage key before resaving is most practical?
[16:42:34] <mmanrique> can't you just put the new paragraph into the localstorage?
[16:42:43] <mmanrique> just overwrite it
[16:43:02] <Boze> ahh your right, I was += lemme try that
[16:43:35] <Horriblist> lol
[16:45:39] <Boze> mmanrique, thanks that did it. I think i was staring at it too long
[16:46:28] <Boze> O_o
[16:47:41] <mmanrique> Boze, np dude
[16:48:02] <work-boy> so where are you from Horriblist?
[16:48:30] <Boze> mmanrique++
[16:50:51] <Horriblist> ur moms butt
[16:53:46] <Tales1> how do i make the the parameter of my function is required to be an array ?
[16:53:57] <shoky> ..
[16:54:11] <Horriblist> []
[16:54:34] <Horriblist> var lol = []
[16:55:06] <Tales1> will this work? : function myfunction( $myparameter[] ){ /* thecode of my function */ }
[16:55:19] <Horriblist> no
[16:55:20] <shoky> no
[16:55:34] <Horriblist> not c++ lol
[16:55:59] <shoky> Tales1: function myfunc( an_array ) { ... }
[16:56:02] <shoky> that's it.
[16:56:14] <Horriblist> but in the function you can check for array
[16:57:34] <Tales1> yeah, i know i can pass it to the function and dosomething like if( is_array( $myparameter ) ){}
[16:58:23] <Tales1> but i was wondering if it's possible to do type hinting, i know i can doit with my custom made classes, but i also know type hinting doesn't work with base types like int and string
[16:58:32] <Horriblist> i dont think so
[16:59:59] <Tales1> you can do this: function __construct( $id, ADO_mysql $db ){} and it works... but you can't do function __construct( int $id, ADO_mysql $db ){}
[17:00:19] <Horriblist> yes
[17:00:28] <Horriblist> i kno its weird
[17:00:49] <Horriblist> php types it automaticly for you
[17:01:40] <Tales1> sometimes it's better to be able to do the type hinting, to prevent mistakes
[17:02:22] <ryannielson> Just wondering if you guys have ever seen any cool examples of textboxes expanding to loading animations or something. I basically have a text box that's going to carry out a search using ajax. So when a search is initiated I want to do some kina of cool transition or loading effect to let the user know the site is carrying out the search.
[17:02:29] <Tales1> Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '[', expecting ')' in /var/www/html/class/draw.php on line 33
[17:03:21] <Tales1> function __construct( $properties[] ){
[17:03:28] <Horriblist> people whine so much about types
[17:03:54] <Horriblist> a program only does what you tell it to
[17:04:02] <Tales1> maybe function __construct( $properties = array() ){} ?
[17:04:07] <Horriblist> yes
[17:04:14] <Horriblist> thats what ur looking for?
[17:04:24] <Horriblist> thats called a default argument
[17:04:30] <Horriblist> or argument deffault
[17:04:34] <ryannielson> Tales1: I was just about to type that tales. That's what you'll have to do
[17:04:56] <Horriblist> yeah but thats not type hinting
[17:04:57] <ryannielson> Tales1: Probably more suited to a php irc channel though. haha
[17:05:21] <Tales1> omg... sorry, all this time i thought it was the php channel
[17:05:29] <Tales1> lol
[17:05:31] <Horriblist> its we have experts here
[17:05:34] <mmanrique> lol
[17:05:38] <mmanrique> hahaha
[17:05:46] <Horriblist> 15 years here
[17:05:55] <ryannielson> Tales1: haha, well got your question answered anyway lol. Luckily some of us know php I guess.
[17:06:37] <recognosco> what is php?
[17:06:41] <Tales1> ok... i alway join the same 5 channels ##php, #fedora, #jquery, #wordpress and #css
[17:08:11] <Tales1> and always check, but well, sometimes you just make mistakes :D thanks for your understanding
[17:09:20] <glaksmono> anyone is around? I'm wondering if I have DOM of <li>'s.. how do i find <li's> with a specific class?
[17:09:35] <coldhead> $('li.someClass')
[17:09:57] <glaksmono> wait, but the li is already stored in some var.. called foo ? foo is list of li's
[17:10:22] <blueadept> anyone know a shorter way to write this, perhaps? http://pastie.org/private/wjmtu1k46jsdesiax1d58a
[17:10:27] <x86> coldhead: so back to our conversation from the other day, if not wrapping document.ready in an anonymous function, how else would I trigger the AJAX event timer with setInterval?
[17:10:32] <Horriblist> $(.class).each
[17:10:36] <coldhead> foo.filter('.someclass')
[17:10:41] <Horriblist> no
[17:10:45] <glaksmono> ah filter cool lemme try that..
[17:10:49] <glaksmono> no? eh?
[17:10:50] <Horriblist> $('.class li).each
[17:11:02] <Horriblist> $('.class li').each
[17:11:07] <glaksmono> Horriblist, I already have the list of li.. in a far
[17:11:08] <glaksmono> var
[17:11:22] <Horriblist> huh
[17:11:35] <Horriblist> then $(var).each ?
[17:11:44] <coldhead> x86: you CAN wrap it in a function, you just have to make sure the function is actually called
[17:11:56] <x86> coldhead: yeah I don't think it is :(
[17:11:59] <coldhead> (function () { /* ... */ })
[17:12:02] <coldhead> that won't be called
[17:12:09] <coldhead> (function () { /* ... */ })();
[17:12:15] <x86> ah ok
[17:12:15] <coldhead> that will be
[17:12:25] <Horriblist> thats closure or whatever rite
[17:12:36] <coldhead> exactly
[17:15:02] <Horriblist> y am i so smart?
[17:15:13] <andrew9184> whats a good hosting company? OT
[17:15:26] <coldhead> Horriblist: good genes and years of practice?
[17:15:27] <Horriblist> media temple?
[17:15:36] <Horriblist> too expensve
[17:15:43] <Horriblist> rackspace?
[17:15:52] <andrew9184> too expensive
[17:15:56] <coldhead> andrew9184: lot of people like linode
[17:15:58] <Horriblist> yeah go w any small one
[17:16:15] <coldhead> if you want to be really budget then dreamhost gives you what you pay for
[17:16:28] <x86> I <3 linode
[17:16:31] <Horriblist> please regulate their monopolies
[17:16:47] <andrew9184> ah i see, does linode have like a cpanel to one click install apps
[17:16:55] <Horriblist> dotn just all go to one company
[17:16:58] <tw2113> dreamhost isn't shitty, but it isn't zomg great either
[17:16:59] <Horriblist> makes it unfair
[17:17:11] <tw2113> <--customer
[17:17:20] <Horriblist> im w mediatemple
[17:18:28] <x86> coldhead: thanks, by the way :)
[17:19:44] <Horriblist> now i have to transform this normal via cros product
[17:20:08] <Horriblist> about to do science
[17:20:19] <coldhead> good luck Horriblist
[17:21:13] <andrew9184> bleh, i might end up with mediatemple
[17:21:36] <Horriblist> hahaha
[17:21:40] <Horriblist> nooooooooooo
[17:21:41] <coldhead> there are worse fates
[17:21:45] <Horriblist> they tooo poooopular
[17:22:01] <Horriblist> dont give em a dime
[17:23:02] <andrew9184> lol i just googled it and low and behold, many complaints
[17:23:14] <Horriblist> like what?
[17:23:34] <Horriblist> never had a problem but i run a selfmanaged debian box
[17:23:43] <Horriblist> id like to kno
[17:24:28] <andrew9184> hmm all the sites list inmotionhosting as the top, but ive never heard of them
[17:26:16] <therealklanni> Does anyone know of a way to extend a more than one jQuery UI widget into a new one?
[17:26:52] <ryannielson> Anyone know of any good indefinite progress bars I acn use on a site. Basically an alternative to a spinner/
[17:26:54] <glaksmono> filter works, thanks coldhead :)
[17:26:56] <wubino> live @ http://dl.dropbox.com/u/33379439/website/index.html
[17:27:13] <Horriblist> argh glaksmono use my prety syntax
[17:27:15] <wubino> anyway to make the aside sit at the top of the content section
[17:27:17] <wubino> ?
[17:27:21] <Horriblist> filter geeeey
[17:30:59] <glaksmono> haha
[17:31:07] <glaksmono> hey, how about selecting those those are selected?
[17:31:17] <glaksmono> oh i thin i got it
[17:32:22] <Horriblist> im not helping u anymore
[17:38:47] <coldhead> .filter(':selected')
[17:39:01] <coldhead> or possibly find(':selected')
[17:46:21] <Boze> is there any best practices for showing a day marked on a calendar. like every tuesday is an event?
[17:48:09] <Horriblist> using date function
[17:48:33] <Boze> hmm
[17:50:27] <Horriblist> its lots of logic
[17:50:30] <Horriblist> well some
[17:52:03] <Boze> have to do some wheel re-inventing :)
[17:55:21] <x86> coldhead: so, using that setInterval seems to work just fine for triggering my function to be called after the first interval, but doesn't seem to trigger at the next interval... do I have to reset it?
[17:56:59] <coldhead> ?p @ x86
[17:57:00] <bot-t> x86, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:58:23] <x86> sec, think I might see the issue :)
[17:58:50] <Lindrian> I have bound several events that overlap to a textarea
[17:58:54] <x86> yep, works like a champ now :)
[17:59:03] <Lindrian> problem is that this sometimes causes the code to fire several times
[17:59:07] <Lindrian> can this somehow be fixed?
[17:59:16] <x86> coldhead: I had forgotten to change from setTimeout to setInterval... works as expected now :)
[17:59:21] <Lindrian> So that only one of the triggered events fire.
[17:59:26] <Stephen> Guest77640: You're in here?
[17:59:37] <Stephen> Has someone been impersonating a brotha?
[17:59:38] <Stephen> wth?
[18:00:00] <coldhead> good work x86
[18:01:02] <Zak> Stephen: it probably wasn't deliberate
[18:01:27] <Stephen> Yeah, I know
[18:01:32] <Stephen> Name is too common
[18:01:40] <m1r0> Any ideas of how I could better color this? I've finally got crossbrowser support working: http://cssdeck.com/labs/full/7mnmi66l/0
[18:02:04] <Stephen> As it is I pried this one out of the hands of an IRCOp who had let it run past it's expiration date
[18:02:55] <Stephen> m1r0: Loading
[18:03:06] <xenome> anyone know how to get two horizontal radio buttons to stretch full width in jquery mobile?
[18:03:28] <JoeSlack> modify the css
[18:05:25] <Stephen> full width radio button wha?
[18:05:41] <Stephen> Wiener dog radio buttons?
[18:06:39] <xenome> yes, I'm displaying two radio buttons in a pop-up and I'd like them to fit the complete width
[18:06:51] <xenome> the default is just to make them large enough to contain the text
[18:07:10] <Stephen> ... whurd m1x0 go...
[18:07:46] <Stephen> Ah, text internal radio button. Makes more sense now
[18:07:52] <Lindrian> how can I detect with jquery ANY change to a textarea?
[18:07:59] <Lindrian> typeing, pasting, deleting, etc
[18:08:00] <Lindrian> everything
[18:08:21] <Stephen> Lindrian: hook onkeyup, onchange, and onblur
[18:08:24] <JoeSlack> event listeners
[18:08:38] <Stephen> Or use the new DOM Mutation API
[18:08:40] <Lindrian> Stephen: I need to handle the input the instan its typed
[18:08:46] <Lindrian> instant*
[18:08:48] <Stephen> onkeyup
[18:08:52] <Lindrian> so keyup is too slow
[18:09:06] <Stephen> onkeydown will be too buggy
[18:09:06] <Lindrian> if you hold down a button, each letter has to trigger the event.
[18:09:23] <Stephen> Ah, well then, onkeydown it is
[18:09:35] <Stephen> Just be sure and hook it with .once()
[18:09:42] <Stephen> (and re-hook)
[18:09:50] <Lindrian> Never used that, what is it?
[18:10:03] <Stephen> .once() is a one-time event handler
[18:10:03] <b-ot> Stephen, memorised “once()”.
[18:10:16] <Lindrian> Right now I have the following events: 'propertychange keyup keydown input click'
[18:10:23] <Stephen> If you're finding onkeydown is flooding, .once() is the answer
[18:10:26] <Lindrian> this works fine in all browsers, but fires several events in most.
[18:10:40] <Lindrian> which is not very good for performance
[18:10:40] <m1r0> Stephen: What do you mean loading? Sorry I was afk
[18:11:29] <Stephen> alright, lets see
[18:12:06] <Stephen> Lindrian: You need to pick 2 of those events and stick with them. Try to stay away from ones which overlap
[18:12:49] <Lindrian> which ones Stephen?
[18:12:51] <Stephen> Lindrian: If you must then have overlapping events call a shared callback object which throttles
[18:13:04] <Lindrian> that sounds promising
[18:13:14] <pixeltarian> Does anyone know of a nice and legit redirect service for registrars that don't have a redirect feature built in? (I know this is a bit OT, and feel free to guide me to the appropriate channel)
[18:13:15] <Lindrian> no idea how to do that though
[18:13:19] <Stephen> onkeydown and onfocus tend to overlap in the beginning
[18:13:29] <Stephen> onkeyup and onblur tend to overlap
[18:13:38] <Stephen> onkeyup and onchange definitely overlap
[18:13:54] <Stephen> so can onchange and onblur
[18:13:57] <Lindrian> could you _please_ provide some sample code?
[18:14:09] <pixeltarian> I found this: http://www.freedns.ws/en/ but I don't if it is legit and I don't want to give out DNS entries to any old place.
[18:14:10] <Lindrian> i have no idea how to throttle
[18:14:20] <Stephen> Hmm... which part are you needing example of
[18:14:28] <Stephen> The throttle... alright
[18:14:39] <Lindrian> awesome
[18:14:58] <Stephen> I'm going to preface this with: "I feel if you are hooking that many events on one object that you are doing something wrong."
[18:15:17] <Stephen> Can you help me understand why you are hooking all those events?
[18:15:25] <Lindrian> yes, 1 sec
[18:15:27] <Stephen> It will help in design of the throttle
[18:15:42] <JoeSlack> it sounds a bit lazy.  Figure out exactly what you need your input to do.
[18:15:57] <m1r0> Any ideas of how I could better color this? I've finally got crossbrowser support working: http://cssdeck.com/labs/full/7mnmi66l/0
[18:16:02] <rubric99> Hey
[18:16:14] <pixeltarian> Can anyone recommend a domain name redirect service for registrars that don't have redirect built in?
[18:16:42] <Lindrian> Stephen: its for http://regex101.com/ -- you see that input box (input your regular exp...) ; it highlights the contents accordingly
[18:16:44] <Stephen> m1r0: Hunt down a blog that talks about transparent radio buttons. I think the design would look good like that. It shouldn't be hard to find
[18:16:50] <Lindrian> I need this to be done on a character to character basis
[18:16:54] <Lindrian> it has to be swift and responsive
[18:16:54] <rubric99> How do I insertAfter an <h1> in a specific div?
[18:17:03] <Lindrian> I also need it to work cross browser
[18:17:40] <Stephen> Then you need to hook onkeyup
[18:18:06] <Stephen> accounting for holding a keydown on an app like this is futile
[18:18:18] <m1r0> Stephen: Can't find any blogs
[18:18:41] <m1r0> I can find styling a radio button, but not one that's "transparent"
[18:19:03] <Lindrian> Stephen: but thats what I want.
[18:19:13] <JoeSlack> just modify the background images....
[18:19:21] <JoeSlack> css
[18:19:25] <Stephen> m1r0: Here's the skinny: think like the shape of a tablet
[18:19:37] <Stephen> The screen is a window, the edges solid black or white
[18:19:40] <aqeel> hi everyone
[18:19:47] <Stephen> The value selected is shown in the window
[18:19:55] <Stephen> But the window itself slides side to side
[18:19:58] <Lindrian> I need it to be responsive Stephen.
[18:20:09] <Stephen> The mechanics are a bit different than your site, but it would look nice
[18:20:51] <Stephen> Lindrian: It will be plenty responsive. What use case were you given that caused you to venture past onkeyup?
[18:21:05] <m1r0> I was thinking more on the line of coloring than shapes
[18:21:12] <pixeltarian> 3rd party redirect service. Any recommendations?
[18:21:13] <Lindrian> If you press say '+' and keep pressing it, it needs to be highlighted accordingly.
[18:21:14] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/BUKfT/
[18:21:21] <Lindrian> If you only trigger keyup it wont.
[18:21:22] <aqeel> i never get to get the 2nd alert
[18:22:12] <aqeel> full code here
[18:22:14] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[18:23:30] <Stephen> Lindrian; I understand. You want keyup repeats in a consistant, controllable fashion
[18:23:41] <Stephen> ie: You want to get rid of the initial delay
[18:24:05] <Lindrian> As long as it updates swiftly, even when I hold the key down.
[18:24:49] <Stephen> So, I retract my previous statement. A throttle is not what you need here
[18:25:00] <Stephen> You need a custom keyrepeater implementation
[18:25:09] <Stephen> This is actually much easier.
[18:25:43] <Stephen> Have you recorded the timing differences between the initial repeat and successive repeats?
[18:25:54] <Lindrian> no
[18:26:01] <Lindrian> this sounds advanced lol
[18:26:24] <Stephen> Lindrian: Are you attempting to just get rid of that initial delay, or are you wanting to completely control the repeat speed?
[18:26:35] <Lindrian> Neither.
[18:26:44] <Lindrian> I don't want the even to fire several times on the same data
[18:26:51] <Lindrian> Which it does since they overlap
[18:28:18] <Stephen> Ok, do this:
[18:28:29] <Stephen> You are going to hook only 2 events
[18:28:37] <Stephen> onkeyup and onkeydown
[18:29:40] <Stephen> In onkeydown you are going to listen for an onkeyup event to be thrown
[18:30:16] <Stephen> If it is not thrown within 100ms (find a comfortable number) you are going to throw onkeyup manually
[18:31:25] <Stephen> You will add data in this manual onkeyup to mark it different than the real onkeyup
[18:32:04] <Lindrian> hmm okay
[18:32:16] <Lindrian> its 3.30 am right now, i'll have to read up on this tomorrow
[18:32:23] <Lindrian> i have no idea how to do this stuff
[18:32:26] <Stephen> in these manual (.one()) onkeyup events you will watch for it's corresponding real onkeyup event
[18:32:33] <Stephen> lol
[18:32:43] <Stephen> read up on jquery's .once
[18:33:10] <Lindrian> why cant you just limit it to one event per 1ms
[18:33:12] <Lindrian> or 10ms
[18:33:13] <Lindrian> or whatever
[18:33:45] <Stephen> you're basically going to have both of the fake onkeyup and onkeydown events watching for the real onkeyup event. Until they see it, they will trigger eachother at some interval
[18:34:18] <Stephen> Events are already throttled like that by the browser. Problem is they queue.
[18:34:34] <Lindrian> cant you clear the queue?
[18:34:35] <Stephen> And, even if you did throttle them, that means dropping key presses
[18:34:47] <Stephen> Which defeats the responsiveness idea
[18:35:17] <Stephen> If you really want the throttle, just read up on jquery's deferreds
[18:35:38] <Lindrian> Alright
[18:35:43] <Lindrian> I'll probably be back tomorrow
[18:35:45] <Lindrian> heh
[18:36:14] <Stephen> What you'll end up making is a deferred factory that creates 1 deferred at a time through which ALL events send their handlers/callbacks
[18:36:46] <Stephen> The parts that enables that action is deferred.resolve()
[18:37:04] <Stephen> resolve(), no matter how many times you call it, only triggers the first time.
[18:37:39] <Lindrian> Okay.
[18:37:45] <Lindrian> Saving all this so I can read it again tomorrow
[18:37:46] <Stephen> So all the other handlers that call it will essentially be ignored
[18:37:51] <Stephen> np
[18:38:00] <Lindrian> because I'm understanding -1 right now
[18:38:02] <Stephen> Deferred can get really wierd when you read them
[18:38:06] <Stephen> he
[18:38:07] <Lindrian> hoping to get on a 0 tomorrow morning lol
[18:38:19] <Stephen> note: Deferreds are also sometimes called Promises
[18:38:47] <Lindrian> thanks for all the info Stephen
[18:39:01] <Stephen> (Promises are to Deferreds as Handlers/Callbacks are to Events)
[18:39:04] <Stephen> np

[18:41:06] <Lindrian> Stephen: do you have any example code I can look at?
[18:41:11] <Lindrian> that does what I want, or something similar?
[18:41:15] <therealklanni> dammit ajpiano update your jQuery Widget Factory slides :P you wrote that in 1.9 it will have _super and gave an example of: this._super('_setOption', key, value); which isn't correct (any longer?)
[18:41:43] <therealklanni> this._super() or this._superApply([args])
[18:41:49] <Stephen> Lindrian: No, I've never had to do that before
[18:41:59] <Stephen> I know it will work, it just seems like overkill

[18:49:12] <aqeel> nope, no difference
[18:51:14] <Stephen> aqueel: then move the state = true one more scope level out
[18:51:28] <Stephen> That means you are running edgescroll every time

[19:45:53] <mlakewood> Hi all. Im just starting to build my first OSS library. its pretty simple. But I wanted to get it "right" in terms of how its object is set up. I've looked at the backbone.js code and they seem to encapsulate it in a (function(){}).call(this); and I'm not exactly sure what that is doing. Does anybody have advice for the best way to structure a lib, and or links to a small example that I might be able to get my head around?
[19:46:45] <JoeSlack> mlakewood: It's like using document ready
[19:47:08] <JoeSlack> just a nice jquery shorthand, will only run when jquery loaded

[19:48:25] <descon> hey everyon
[19:48:30] <descon> happy new years
[19:49:37] <descon> I'm looking for a little help with positioning a canvas element via .offset() but am running into trouble, has anyone had experience with this?
[19:51:14] <descon> hey there
[19:51:53] <JoeSlack> what's the problem, lots of people have experience with offset and canvas here.
[19:52:59] <descon> I think the trouble is that I'm mixing up jquery with a regular javascript selector, but can't get it to work either way
[19:53:08] <descon> var canvas = document.getElementById('bgcanvas');
[19:53:18] <descon> canvas.offset( {top:10, left:10 } );
[19:53:24] <descon> doesn't seem to work
[19:53:44] <descon> @JoeSlack - thanks for the reply BTW
[19:54:35] <JoeSlack> ok, so it's not really a canvas thing ;)   just an offset thing
[19:54:47] <mlakewood> Ok so my question is for a library that other are going to use. Is it "Not a Good Idea" to just var an object literal? i.e. is it better to have a function return the object ?
[19:55:41] <descon> @JoeSlack - is it that the offset isn't able to select the canvas you figure?
[19:55:50] <JoeSlack> mlakewood: depends entirely on the utility.  Impossible to answer in this context.
[19:55:51] <hateIE> god bless prependTo
[19:56:09] <Stephen> Lindrian: You still around?
[19:56:14] <Stephen> Lindrian: http://jsfiddle.net/DrdFL/26/
[19:56:35] <JoeSlack> descon: Have you tried:   $("#bgcanvas").offset({top:10, left:10}); ?
[19:56:59] <Stephen> Lindrian: You'll want to adjust keyWait to your preference
[19:57:01] <mlakewood> JoeSlack: So what does one have over the other? I don't think I need any private variables (I'm a python programmer really, we don't have such a thing beyond convention)
[19:57:35] <descon> JoeSlack: I have and it doesnt seem to do the trick :/
[19:57:57] <JoeSlack> You don't really, just depends on coding conventions  / styles.  Most javascript programmers are coding with many other languages
[19:58:20] <JoeSlack> descon: Are you sure?  Or is it that the offset changes aren't updating
[19:58:29] <JoeSlack> (css position, etc)
[19:58:56] <JoeSlack> are you getting error?  Because if not, it could just be that you need to tweak your element.  try setting it with an absolute position
[19:59:25] <JoeSlack> but may i ask, why offset?

[20:02:12] <JoeSlack> no worries
[20:22:58] <descon> hmmm - back with more trouble

[20:24:55] <descon> var canvas = $("#bgcanvas");

[20:41:29] <aqeel> ?.off()
[20:42:12] <__machine> .off() will unbind other events... i just want to prevent them from also firing sometimes (in my bound event handler) ... for debouncing

[21:14:43] <dylan9o4> yes, but within its container

[23:00:41] <monk3y> Now that that's settled, gry; does it help you?
[23:01:05] <kurol> that 1st answer is php too
[23:02:02] <digitalmediaguy> typed mine up on Stack as well :)   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14134371/why-isnt-this-jquery-animation-rotating-like-its-supposed-to
[23:02:32] <kurol> that 1st answer is evil too since he's manually creating json. that's how people end up with the wrong quotes.
[23:03:35] <kurol> omg I can't read that many levels of indention sorry, digitalmediaguy
[23:03:48] <monk3y> Oh yeah that's totes evil.  Like if their was a Disney movie about JSON, that would be the villain.  And the funny-but-clumsy duo "json_encode(array[])" would be the good guys.
[23:03:56] <digitalmediaguy> lol… I know… but there is a link to the fiddle… much easier! ;)
[23:03:58] <monk3y> Don't mind me.  I'm doing an all-nighter.  It's the coffee typing.
[23:04:13] <ionico> good night all
[23:04:17] <kurol> only thing I can say is change your parseInt to look like parseInt(lalala, 10)
[23:04:22] <ionico> thanks for helping me today
[23:04:36] <kurol> ?parseint radix
[23:04:40] <bot-t> kurol, #7730 (offset.js: setOffset uses parseInt to parse css values which ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7730
[23:04:46] <kurol> well that's not it
[23:06:59] <gry> monk3y: hum, i have jqPlot on a site (it works clent side when i hard code a graph to plot) and {x1=>y1, x2=>y2} json on server.. trying to figure out how to have the graph plot the json when user clicks a button
[23:08:24] <gry> monk3y: http://advent.perldancer.org/2011/14 <-- like this, but not highcharts.com.. trying to use jqPlot
[23:08:39] <gry> monk3y: (it has a js snippet on that page)
[23:10:58] <monk3y> gry: ah ok.  Well if the data coming back is the right format (in your console), then all you need to do is attach the plot1 function to an element's .click().
[23:11:27] <monk3y> (and fix the plot1 function call by adding plot1 = function() { $.jqPlot(... } at the start)
[23:12:09] <monk3y> By having without the "function ()" at the start, it's going to evaluate the $.jqPlot call upon declaration of the plot1 var .. and it won't render it when you call it.
[23:12:34] <gry> monk3y: I'm sorry, but a part of the problem is that i have only around 2 minutes experience with jquery and don't know how to handle events :-) could you find some example close to what you think i should do, perhaps?
[23:13:11] <monk3y> Uh sure.  Take note that I only have a few more minutes experience than you, so use my advice as a guide for Googling for more specific advice ;)
[23:15:13] <gry> plot1 is in jqPlot you mean?
[23:15:51] <monk3y> Uh.  That StackOverflow question you pointed to; was that yours, or someone else's?
[23:15:58] <gry> someone else
[23:16:12] <monk3y> Argh ok, heh.  Sorry I thought it was yours and you were trying to work out the answers.
[23:16:26] <monk3y> Ok .. so you've had 2mins jquery experience, so how much code have you already written?
[23:16:33] <monk3y> Mind throwing it into a jsFiddle instance or something?
[23:19:10] <gry> monk3y: first off i tried the usual way of things -- js in .js file and html in an html file - but it complained that a function is undefined... so unfortunately everything will be in html with inline js in it. do note that server isnt public so you won't be able to test it --
[23:19:15] <gry> monk3y: http://pastebin.ca/2298909
[23:19:44] <granden> Hi, how could I detect if a users press in an input field, <select>, or check box? If they do I want to toggle a div to hide when they do and when that looses focus it should show it again.
[23:21:32] <monk3y> gry: heh ok man, you're certainly giving it a go.
[23:21:54] <monk3y> So you know your PHP?  You've written the chart/year/year server-side code?
[23:22:10] <gry> server side thing is 'chart/y1/y2' and is in perl
[23:22:14] <monk3y> Gotcha.
[23:22:21] <monk3y> Well, as long as it returns JSON eh.
[23:22:33] <gry> yes, it does
[23:22:40] <monk3y> There's a few things you can sex-up to do with the javascript, but you'll see that around the 'net.  I guess you just need to get the chart going.
[23:22:58] <gry> format of server side thing being {x1=>y1, x2 => y2, x3 => y3}
[23:23:00] <monk3y> So you've pasted-in but commented the PHP code from the StackOverflow answer..
[23:23:11] <gry> yes
[23:23:49] <monk3y> Well that's not going to help you much, it's just showing how someone would cook up the response in PHP.  You're already doing that in Perl, so take that code out.
[23:24:01] <gry> yeah, i would delete it
[23:24:16] <monk3y> So your getJSON call successfully returns JSON and you're printing it to the console?
[23:25:07] <gry> i don't know how to print it in console... pointing page to it returns empty output.. it's ajax type of thing and browser doesn't display it just when i input the url
[23:25:22] <gry> sorry may i ask what timezone you're in? i think a conference is about to start around here (i would be back in a 3 hours or so)
[23:25:31] <monk3y> Ah ok.  I'm in GMT-5.
[23:25:56] <gry> it's 2AM around there perhaps?
[23:26:01] <monk3y> But I'm off soon, apologies.
[23:26:03] <monk3y> 'tis.
[23:26:23] <gry> ok, see you in the afternoon tomorrow perhaps :)
[23:26:30] <monk3y> My best advice; copy the code from the bottom of that StackOverflow thread; the box titled "Client side".
[23:26:32] <monk3y> Start there.
[23:26:47] <gry> thanks, i'll take a look
[23:27:56] <monk3y> Sure.  jQuery's like women; complex, necessary, beautiful, but sometimes very difficult to determine where you've done the wrong thing.
[23:30:58] <monk3y> .. tough crowd.
[23:35:50] <granden> the is(":focus")
[23:36:02] <granden> does that work for all type of form inputs?
[23:37:25] <JoeSlack> lol monk3y
[23:37:55] <JoeSlack> granden: all the ones I've used
[23:38:07] <monk3y> Yaay!  An audience!  Even if it might be typed out of sympathy.
[23:39:15] <granden> I did rethink it a bit, dont think that would work either. As I need to have an active listener to see if any of the form fields/types is active. And then do something. And when it looses focus again from one to undo the action
[23:40:30] <JoeSlack> that's easy?
[23:40:55] <granden> it is?
[23:41:46] <JoeSlack> $("#my_scope).live('active', 'input.myclass', function(event) { ... });
[23:42:23] <granden> that would take care of all text fields for sure yes, but if I want <select> and checkboxes?
[23:42:50] <granden> could I drop that input and only have .myclass?
[23:42:52] <JoeSlack> err , focus not active
[23:42:57] <JoeSlack> of course
[23:43:00] <granden> and add that class to all fields?
[23:43:03] <granden> ok great
[23:43:12] <JoeSlack> and change your scope to something searchable
[23:43:13] <granden> and why do you got function(event) ? What is event for?
[23:43:18] <JoeSlack> and I think live has been depreciated in 1.8.2
[23:43:24] <granden> yeah, I need $(document) i think.
[23:43:36] <granden> Great I use 1.8.3 :)
[23:43:44] <JoeSlack> lots of things.  it's the event handler.  You can access properties, and change the way the event behaves
[23:44:04] <JoeSlack> $(document).on('focus', '.myclass', function(event) { ... });
[23:44:10] <granden> ah :)
[23:44:30] <JoeSlack> so, let's pretend that you wanted to TAKE OVER that focus event.  and you want it to do something else.
[23:44:48] <JoeSlack> $(document).on('focus', '.myclass', function(event) { event.preventDefault();  alert("hi mom!"); return false });
[23:44:55] <granden> no dont want it do something else. Want it to do what it does but I alsa want to do something else.
[23:45:11] <JoeSlack> that would capture the focus, let you do your thing, and return 0, preventing default action
[23:45:13] <DaVinciIT> morning all. can you suggest me a standard JQuery UI to make a 'carousel' ? thank you.
[23:45:29] <DaVinciIT> (or a stable plugin)
[23:45:42] <granden> JoeSlack: But I guess I would just need to not add your event.preventdefault and return false?
[23:45:47] <JoeSlack> correct :)
[23:45:50] <granden> and it should still do what it does and what I want.
[23:45:50] <JoeSlack> play with it
[23:45:54] <JoeSlack> yeppers.
[23:46:15] <JoeSlack> DaVinciIT: http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/12/jquery-carousel.html
[23:46:17] <granden> JoeSlack: But is there an nofocus I could use so I can detect when it looses focus?
[23:46:39] <JoeSlack> yep, "blur" instead of "focus"
[23:46:48] <granden> Ah, thanks!
[23:47:22] <DaVinciIT> thank you
