[00:00:14] <Cork> you can manage to hit ater animate but before its complete function is called
[00:00:23] <Cork> *after
[00:02:17] <ndss56> Cork: buggy. you have to click many times in a row to get it to stop. http://jsfiddle.net/cqEEL/9/
[00:02:28] <Cork> like i said
[00:04:22] <ndss56> Hi, can I get some help fixing this buggy example. You have to click it many times before it actually stops. see http://jsfiddle.net/cqEEL/9/
[00:04:57] <Cork> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/cqEEL/11/
[00:05:38] <ndss56> Cork: :D
[00:05:47] <ndss56> Cork: Now I have to work out what you did.
[00:07:34] <ndss56> Cork: I understand the code, but don't understand why it works.
[00:08:09] <Dr-Bombay> ndss: that's because .stop doesn't prevent the complete function from being called
[00:08:23] <Cork> ndss56: stop just drops the queue
[00:08:50] <Cork> ndss56: so theres a small chance that the callback will be called after you click the button
[00:09:02] <Cork> that would trigger a new round of animation
[00:09:06] <Cork> and start the loop again
[00:09:19] <ndss56> Cork: its still buggy?
[00:09:28] <Cork> nope
[00:09:40] <Dr-Bombay> oh, I'm wrong, stop does eliminate the callbacks
[00:09:47] <ndss56> Cork: you just said small chance it will go buggy.
[00:10:05] <Cork> ndss56: the effect you had was cause it wasn't handled
[00:10:12] <istvan> ok, another hitch: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/769536/cluster/layout.html -- under the add tab clicking on the tabs aught to scroll the jscrollpane. The js to do so I thought was nodes.js on line 605. what'd i get wrong?
[00:10:21] <Cork> its not buggy, its just that it needs to be calculated with
[00:10:32] <istvan> following this example: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/scroll_to.html and http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/jScrollPane/scrollToSpeed.html
[00:10:39] <newbiee> i need help n using jquery autocomplete
[00:10:50] <Cork> ndss56: animation and timers are async so you have to have that in mind when handling things like this
[00:11:51] <ndss56> Cork: would a simpler, less buggy solution include just changing background color rather than opacity.
[00:12:00] <newbiee> when using autocomplete i only need to send the letters after @ but it is delivering the whole text in the input..how can i customise that
[00:12:13] <Cork> ndss56: what buggyness are you talking about?
[00:12:21] <Cork> and no any animation will have this effect
[00:12:22] <ndss56> Cork: you just said small chance it will go buggy.
[00:12:28] <Cork> sigh
[00:12:31] <Cork> read again
[00:14:28] <ndss56> Cork:  why does adding this fix the problem?   if($('input').data('clicked')) { $('input').removeData('clicked'); return; }
[00:14:47] <Cork> check the click event handler
[00:15:28] <ndss56> Cork: the event handler adds data
[00:15:38] <ndss56> Cork: and the function removes it
[00:15:42] <Cork> and the callback checks if its set
[00:15:47] <Cork> and if its set it removes it yes
[00:15:55] <Cork> and then ends early
[00:17:00] <ndss56> Cork: Ah, didn't see the return. wouldn't using if and else be cleaner?
[00:17:09] <Cork> no
[00:17:24] <Cork> that would mean you would have to indent everything in the callback
[00:18:59] <ndss56> Cork: So this example is now producation grade quality?
[00:19:16] <Cork> sure
[00:19:20] <newbiee> anyone familiar with jquery autocomplete?
[00:19:36] <Cork> ndss56: actually you chould remove the stop part if you like
[00:19:47] <Cork> and let the animation run to its end
[00:19:58] <ndss56> Cork: What do you mean?
[00:20:11] <Cork> sigh... do what you like
[00:20:23] <na3r> i have an element with data newsID
[00:20:33] <ndss56> Cork: I do want you recommend.
[00:20:40] <na3r> <li data-newsId="114">somtihng</li>
[00:21:12] <na3r> how to check if element exitst with data-newsId==114 do something
[00:21:41] <Cork> $('li[data-newsId="114"]').length > 0
[00:21:51] <Cork> thats a slow selector though
[00:22:09] <Cork> it will first find all li's on the page then check there dtaa-newsId attribute
[00:22:22] <Cork> *data-newsId
[00:22:38] <na3r> Cork, you mean i shuld use each loop
[00:22:43] <na3r> for all li
[00:22:55] <Cork> no, i meant thats what it does
[00:23:16] <ndss56> Cork: removing stop is a bad idea. makes it feel unresponsive.
[00:23:36] <Cork> ndss56: btw just thought of something
[00:23:45] <Cork> try adding two stop()
[00:23:58] <Cork> you do have two aniamte() calls in a row so it might be needed
[00:23:59] <ndss56> Cork: two stop()? pls show :D
[00:24:03] <Cork> no
[00:24:14] <Cork> you need to code some your self too
[00:24:25] <ndss56> Cork: where i add the other stop?
[00:24:42] <Cork> right after the first one?
[00:24:48] <newbiee> when trying to use automcomplete it overrides my whole text with the one i selected but the prefilled text should also be preserved?
[00:25:07] <ndss56> Cork: i see 4 animate calls
[00:25:37] <ndss56> Cork: did you add 2 too many?
[00:25:40] <Cork> newbiee: whats selected in the dropdown is whats added to the field
[00:26:05] <Cork> newbiee: if you want to have something else, you need to overide the default functionality
[00:26:24] <newbiee> for that would i have to make changes to the jquery autocomlete js file
[00:27:07] <Cork> nothing
[00:27:15] <Cork> you override it
[00:29:32] <Cork> newbiee: this should get you going http://www.michelsalib.com/2010/08/extended-customization-of-jquery-ui-autocomplete/
[00:30:35] <istvan> yall - https://dl.dropbox.com/u/769536/cluster/layout.html -- no matter which tab you click on under the 'add' pane the console shows "stats" as being the tab clicked. How can I change nodes.js:609 to do what I expect it to?
[00:33:07] <ndss56> Cork: improved it more. only two animate was needed. http://jsfiddle.net/cqEEL/13/
[00:34:55] <Dr-Bombay> ndss56: I haven't been paying attention to cork's suggestion but here's a thing http://jsfiddle.net/Yna6P/2/
[00:35:03] <diverdude> Dr-Bombay: ahh thats nice
[00:35:38] <xec> istvan: it's a scoping issue, your li and container variables are pointing to the last iteration of the loop.
[00:35:59] <ndss56> Dr-Bombay: Your example doesn't seem to be working in IE8.
[00:36:02] <xec> istvan: you could fix it with a closure or restructure a bit
[00:36:43] <istvan> xec: mm. and var li2  = li; wouldn't create a new instance?
[00:37:35] <xec> istvan: no, it's just a reference afaik
[00:37:46] <diverdude> there should be made some testbed for web programs, so that it would be possible to quickly verify in which browsers the tested code is working, and in which ones not!
[00:38:29] <ndss56> Cork: not sure why you need two stop(), because one seems to work fine.
[00:38:40] <istvan> xec: ah. makes sense. so how can I make this work with a closure?
[00:40:17] <xec> istvan: a slightly hackish fix would be to slap it in a iife, and replace your click handler with something like (function(container,li){ /* return your click handler function here */ })(container,li);
[00:40:52] <xec> istvan: container and li vars should then be a reference to the current iteration
[00:42:38] <xec> istvan: or you could make one click handler for all the li's and then check the dom element's info for where to scroll to (you could save something to it with .data() for instance)
[00:42:59] <istvan> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/769536/cluster/layout.html -- error?
[00:43:32] <istvan> xec: ^
[00:43:45] <ndss56> u there corky?
[00:44:33] <xec> istvan: what did you change? what is the $('#addNodeBody').data('jsp') supposed to do?
[00:45:31] <istvan> xec: ah ha! got it! just had to nest another function in there. that is the api reference for jscrollpane. Thanks for the help!
[00:47:14] <xec> istvan: it doesn't look quite right to me, it's not func(input) it's (func)(input)
[00:47:51] <xec> (func(input)) works too, or !func(input) but thats beside the point :P
[00:48:07] <istvan> xec: dunno... it's working? i don't know beyond that...
[00:50:06] <xec> istvan: in any case you can read more about it here: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[00:51:01] <istvan> xec: bookmarked for the morning - tis nearly 4am now, but wasn't gonna sleep till that was done :p
[00:51:04] <istvan> thanks for the help!
[00:51:14] <xec> yw ;)
[00:51:21] <istvan> night all
[01:02:43] <jstout24> os we're loading external scripts (offers) that do documentwrite...
[01:03:05] <jstout24> right now, we're using ajax do get content and inject it into a dom element… the element contains document.write…. how can i make this work?
[01:04:56] <Cork> jstout24: you can't really
[01:05:05] <Cork> don't use document.write
[01:05:06] <Cork> ever
[01:05:13] <jstout24> i don't use document.write
[01:05:20] <jstout24> it's 3rd party, aka partners, scripts
[01:05:44] <Cork> you can't append it through jquery then
[01:06:02] <Cork> [0].innerHTML = blob;
[01:06:18] <jstout24> well nayyysteee
[01:06:37] <Cork> but be careful moving inline js around will run it each time you append the block to the dom
[01:06:49] <jstout24> we're in charge of most stuff that we inject
[01:07:17] <jstout24> if any of our clients do anything dangerous, they'd probably just get themselves into a pretty lawsuite…. our contracts say so
[01:07:34] <jstout24> $(that.element).html(response.content).show(); is what we're currently doing
[01:07:50] <Cork> ya, and that will extract all js scripts out of the context
[01:07:54] <Cork> and run them in head
[01:08:22] <Cork> to prevent problems with $('other selector').append($('selector'))
[01:08:39] <Cork> hmm no that one will work
[01:08:44] <Cork> to prevent problems with $('other selector').append($('selector').html())
[01:08:51] <Cork> that will fail with inline js
[01:09:13] <Cork> (you have the same problem with inlineHTML)
[01:10:40] <newbiee> how can i request a new password in freenode?
[01:10:46] <jstout24> yeah, $(that.element).html(document.write('WTF')).show(); freaks out
[01:10:57] <Cork> newbiee: #freenode
[01:14:18] <jstout24> $(that.element)[0].innerHTML = response.content; seems to work… any problems?
[01:14:28] <Cork> jstout24: that line doesn't make sense at all
[01:14:37] <Cork> opps the earlier i ment
[01:14:40] <Cork> *meant
[01:14:41] <jstout24> lol
[01:15:03] <Cork> write doesn't return anything so you can't put that in the html
[01:15:05] <jstout24> yeah it was an example of what was basically happening
[01:15:11] <Cork> no
[01:15:22] <jstout24> oops
[01:15:26] <jstout24> yeah i get what you mean
[01:15:42] <Cork> $(that.element).html('<script>document.write("WTF")</script>').show(); is what happens
[01:15:44] <jstout24> .html("<script>document.write('WTF');</script>") or something like that
[01:15:51] <Cork> yup :)
[01:15:53] <jstout24> haha
[01:15:58] <jstout24> typo
[01:16:01] <jstout24> but yeah, it doesn't work that way
[01:16:10] <Cork> well yes, the problem i mentioned before is the problem
[01:16:22] <jstout24> switching it to `$(that.element)[0].innerHTML = response.content;` appears to do what we need it to do
[01:16:32] <Cork> if you ever move that content around it will run the js again
[01:16:39] <BinaryKitten> urm that's really really silly
[01:16:54] <BinaryKitten> jstout24 if you're wanting to use native js that's fine
[01:17:11] <Cork> BinaryKitten: thats the only way if you need to handle document.write
[01:17:23] <Cork> jstout24: i don't think you need $() there tough
[01:17:34] <Cork> that.element.innerHTML should work just fine
[01:17:35] <BinaryKitten> that.element.innerHTML = response.contact;   unless you that.element = string
[01:17:35] <jstout24> hmm, just realized it's note executing the javascript inside
[01:17:49] <BinaryKitten> Cork yeah that's what i was referring to.
[01:18:01] <Cork> jstout24: does it have script tags in the content?
[01:18:04] <BinaryKitten> wrapping something in jQuery just to unwrap it again is silly
[01:18:06] <jstout24> Cork, BinaryKitten, yeah i had tried that earlier.. but it could have been a fail b/c i had the document.write in it :P
[01:18:11] <jstout24> Cork, yeah there are script tags
[01:18:19] <jstout24> it's so annoying using other people's shitty code
[01:18:19] <jstout24> lol
[01:18:24] <Cork> ya
[01:18:33] <jstout24> they want us to get their ad on our page by using their crappy document.write code
[01:18:34] <Cork> document.write sucks royally
[01:18:47] <Cork> jstout24: so use an iframe
[01:18:55] <Cork> capsule the crap
[01:19:05] <jstout24> can i make "dynamic" iframes?
[01:19:06] <jstout24> lol
[01:19:16] <Cork> you can reload them
[01:19:27] <Cork> just have a small html file it loads
[01:19:29] <jstout24> without forcing developers to upload a remote offer to embed another offer
[01:19:44] <BinaryKitten> jstout24 are you just loading an external js?
[01:19:49] <jstout24> BinaryKitten, yeah
[01:20:06] <Cork> so load the js in the iframes html
[01:20:25] <Cork> a tiny php script or what ever should make that fairly simple
[01:20:25] <gnarf> so - anyone going to jqconf tomorrow? if so, why are you not asleep yet? :)
[01:20:40] <Cork> though, ya i would prefer if they used modern js
[01:20:49] <jstout24> Cork, BinaryKitten, it's an ad platform i've built… before, I used to just do `http://site.com/advertisement/id` and it would be part of the dom…. now it's more dynamic so i'm trying to get crappy javascript offers to work :P
[01:20:50] <BinaryKitten> va s = document.createElement('script'); s.setAttribute('src', location); s.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript'); document.body.appendChild(s);
[01:21:13] <BinaryKitten> change document.body for the correct ad location
[01:21:24] * Cork nods
[01:21:38] <Cork> though you don't really need the type or to use setAttribute
[01:21:51] <jstout24> BinaryKitten, yeah i know that… it'd be a perfect world if other people could do that..
[01:21:52] <BinaryKitten> Cork you do for older browsers
[01:22:02] <jstout24> all this javascript is out of my control
[01:22:02] <Cork> BinaryKitten: thats a lot older
[01:22:09] <BinaryKitten> Ie7
[01:22:15] <Cork> don't think so
[01:22:30] <BinaryKitten> was last time i tried it.. we had issues without it
[01:22:45] <blackspotwiggins> ie7 generally does that
[01:22:46] * Cork boots a vm to test
[01:22:55] <Cork> i was quite sure it was ie6 that did that >_>
[01:22:57] <BinaryKitten> jstout24 can't you inject their JS to the right space
[01:22:59] <NodeX> IE7 blows, the sooner people stop supporting it, the sooner we can all move forward
[01:23:04] <Cork> it dose
[01:23:14] <BinaryKitten> IE6 is still around guys
[01:23:14] <Cork> ie7 is almost worse then ie6
[01:23:22] <Cork> BinaryKitten: but noone should care
[01:23:28] <jstout24> ie7 & ie6 pays us a lot of money
[01:23:30] <NodeX> anything below ie8 should not be supported
[01:23:36] <jstout24> those users are the dumbest aka click on ads
[01:23:37] <jstout24> :P
[01:23:41] <BinaryKitten> Cork actually it's still a large corporate market share
[01:24:02] <BinaryKitten> quite a few of my company's clients are limited to IE6 in the workplace
[01:24:13] <NodeX> but what would happen if every developer stopped supporting IE6/7 ... they WOULD have to change
[01:24:14] <blackspotwiggins> sucks to be them i guess
[01:24:28] <jstout24> BinaryKitten, if you mean inject their JS by creating an iframe wrapping it, i don't want to have to create iframes for 1000s of offers
[01:24:29] <Cork> BinaryKitten: i know, but thats there problem
[01:24:39] <jstout24> no way to get document.write to work the "right" way
[01:24:46] <Cork> BinaryKitten: now days they HAVE to have an alternative browser in there system
[01:24:48] <NodeX> ie6/7 support hinders development and the geeral shape of the internet
[01:24:53] <Cork> cause many sites don't support ie6
[01:24:54] <BinaryKitten> jstout24 only right way is to not use it
[01:25:01] <jstout24> i *HAVE* to
[01:25:05] <jstout24> it's out of my control
[01:25:13] <jstout24> it's not my code
[01:25:19] <BinaryKitten> cork you tell the clients that
[01:25:22] <NodeX> I think google ceased IE6 support last year
[01:25:23] <jstout24> artners give us their code to put on an ad-tag
[01:25:27] <Cork> BinaryKitten: i do, and they agree
[01:25:41] <BinaryKitten> Cork get them to email us and tell us then
[01:25:43] <Cork> we send almost plain text to ie6 browsers
[01:25:51] <Cork> no css at all
[01:25:55] * NodeX does that too
[01:26:10] <NodeX> with a big fat "Upgrade your shitty browser" message
[01:26:20] <Cork> at the top ya
[01:26:42] <jstout24> i think ie6 made us around 500,000 in revenue last year?
[01:26:44] <NodeX> IMO people who perpetuate the use of bad browsers are as bad as the users themselves
[01:27:03] <NodeX> greed should not be the motivating factor in life jstout24
[01:27:14] <jstout24> says a hipster
[01:27:32] <jstout24> p=
[01:27:35] <NodeX> that money would still be made on a different browser if IE6/7 didnt exist
[01:27:43] <NodeX> else it's a false economy anyway
[01:27:53] <jstout24> depends on the product
[01:28:01] <jstout24> i hate ie6… or ie in general
[01:28:03] <jstout24> but, life is life
[01:28:13] <jstout24> developers need to stop being fucking lazy
[01:28:20] <jstout24> learn how to code for all browsers
[01:28:20] <NodeX> it's not lazyness
[01:28:21] <jstout24> EZ
[01:28:22] <jstout24> cakewalk
[01:28:35] <tystr> jstout24 truth
[01:28:53] <NodeX> it's sheer frustration that an app cannot be "launched 100% properly" due to ie6/7 quirks
[01:29:12] <NodeX> which adds to the overall slump the internet is in at the moment
[01:29:48] <blackspotwiggins> jstout24, im sure you code for lynx as well
[01:29:51] <blackspotwiggins> and test in it
[01:29:55] <NodeX> lmao
[01:29:57] <blackspotwiggins> also, all of the android browser versions
[01:30:00] <blackspotwiggins> and opera 4.0
[01:30:02] <blackspotwiggins> you go girl
[01:30:44] <jstout24> naw, i look at our browser stats and code for that
[01:30:49] <jstout24> i'm not frontend though
[01:30:54] <jstout24> i just make our front-end guys do it
[01:31:08] <NodeX> if ie6/7 ceased to exist tomorrow how many people would say "Oh no, I can't use my browser, that's it no more internet for me" lolol
[01:31:25] <NodeX> they would upgrade/install somehting else
[01:31:26] <jstout24> ie) we're partnered for a job site and they don't support ie6-ie7
[01:31:44] <NodeX> which job site?
[01:31:46] <jstout24> most people looking for jobs are either 1) NodeX / blackspotwiggins , or 2) people with ghetto computers looking for a job
[01:32:46] <blackspotwiggins> well
[01:32:52] <blackspotwiggins> good luck with supporting ie6-7 forever then
[01:32:54] <jstout24> #hipstersRus
[01:33:00] <blackspotwiggins> as long as you keep supporting, they keep using
[01:33:04] <NodeX> which jobsite jstout24 ?
[01:33:08] <blackspotwiggins> sooner or later no frontend dev will want to do that
[01:33:10] <NodeX> +1 blackspotwiggins
[01:33:20] <jstout24> naw, i said i support whatever browsers our hitting our site
[01:33:25] <NodeX> which jobsite jstout24 ?
[01:33:43] <jstout24> if we were coding a twitter or facebook, we probably wouldn't care so much since it's more 'techy' and up to date in the standards worlds
[01:34:52] <blackspotwiggins> facebook is more techy?
[01:34:57] <blackspotwiggins> maybe
[01:35:09] <blackspotwiggins> but it's one of the most used website
[01:35:29] <blackspotwiggins> almost everyone who has internet access has a FB profile
[01:35:37] <blackspotwiggins> with major exceptions of china and russia
[01:35:52] <blackspotwiggins> i wouldnt count that demographic as distinctly techy
[01:35:53] <NodeX> I am not sure how much FB support IE6 ..
[01:35:58] <seutje> they don't really have internet access
[01:36:04] <seutje> they have chinanet or rusnet access
[01:36:07] <NodeX> I know they used to, not sure if they fully support it
[01:36:17] <blackspotwiggins> they dont anymore iirc
[01:36:32] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, russia has no censorship
[01:36:34] <NodeX> I dont think Microsoft even do fully
[01:36:39] <blackspotwiggins> they have a local alternative
[01:36:45] <blackspotwiggins> vkontakte.ru

[01:37:38] <NodeX> google+ ftw
[01:37:59] <NodeX> facebook is bad since IPO and will only get worse
[01:38:22] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, maybe.. but most of the russian speaking countries use vk.ru instead of fb
[01:38:24] <blackspotwiggins> for some reason
[01:38:47] <seutje> Belgium had netlog, but think that kinda died
[01:39:05] <seutje> I hear yammer is gonna go south pretty fast from here on
[01:46:24] <jstout24> google+ is so terribad.

[02:19:08] <zalun> that's why I'm asking about jquerypp
[02:19:40] <billy_> cork: thankx
[02:19:42] <Zhy> ah oops
[02:19:42] <zalun> for every display of this page jsfiddle has to display 10+ embedded fiddles regardless of the ones user wants to see
[02:19:49] <Zhy> sorry vl1234 I see that's java :O
[02:20:10] <billy_> cork: do you have any idea about the google map
[02:20:53] <billy_> please look into these example http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/drawing/drawing-tools.html
[02:21:04] <vl1234> @Zhy k fine.........me to think same way...........but am not get clear idea
[02:21:09] <billy_> Cork :  please look into these example http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/drawing/drawing-tools.html
[02:21:21] <vl1234> @Zhy k fine.........if u get any idea let me know
[02:21:24] <Zhy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7888238/javascript-split-string-on-uppercase-characters this works vl1234
[02:21:57] <Zhy> see first answer, second comment
[02:21:58] <Cork> ?eval var a = "MyNameIsVel"; a.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1').trim()
[02:22:01] <bot-t> Cork: "My Name Is Vel"
[02:22:38] <Cork> you need to test its cross browser ness though
[02:22:45] <Cork> not sure how cross browser trim is
[02:22:51] <Cork> (i think ie doesn't support it)
[02:23:06] <Cork> vl1234: ^
[02:23:26] <billy_> Cork : please look into my link
[02:23:47] <billy_> i just want the coordinates of drew polygon
[02:23:52] <vl1234> @Zhy k fine.........ya thankzzzzz...........but we store in array only.....
[02:24:01] <vl1234> @cork .................what?
[02:31:58] <Zhy> vl1234 where's the problem?
[02:32:59] <vl1234> @Zhy nothing problem.......its store in the array only......but i need as a string like "My Name Is Vel"
[02:33:18] <Zhy> Cork's solution returns a string :)
[02:33:50] <vl1234> @Zhy where it is?
[02:34:06] <vl1234> @Zhy am not seen......can u forward
[02:34:16] <Zhy> http://pastie.org/4164769 look here, I put both solutions together
[02:35:47] <Zhy> and that'
[02:36:00] <Zhy> oops ... anyway: and that's what he wrote, addressing you: http://pastie.org/4164782
[02:37:01] <Cork> ?eval var a = "MyNameIsVel"; a.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1').trim()
[02:37:02] <bot-t> Cork: "My Name Is Vel"
[02:37:07] <Cork> vl1234: ^
[02:37:33] <vl1234> @cork..........if ie is not workin means no use know
[02:37:33] <Cork> but like i said i think trim isn't supported by ie
[02:37:46] <Cork> ?eval var a = "MyNameIsVel"; a.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1').replace(/^ /, '')
[02:37:47] <bot-t> Cork: "My Name Is Vel"
[02:37:49] <Cork> there :)
[02:38:11] <vl1234> @cork..........thankzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[02:38:41] <vl1234> @cork.........if any other way to possible to working in IE
[02:39:15] <vl1234> @cork.........if u dont mine may i know the logic.............
[02:39:36] <vl1234> @cork.........i dont know the ref concept
[02:40:15] <Cork> it grabs each uppercase character and replaces it with the char preceded by a space
[02:40:25] <Cork> then remove the first space in the string if it exists
[02:42:43] <Cork> ?eval var a = "MyNameIsVel"; a.split(/(?=[A-Z])/).join(' ')
[02:42:44] <bot-t> Cork: "My Name Is Vel"
[02:42:47] <Cork> another option
[02:42:57] <Cork> and i think i prefer that one
[02:43:00] <Cork> much cleaner
[02:43:12] <newbiee> how can i make a div with multiple lines scrollable vertically for fixed time
[02:43:45] <Cork> newbiee: for fixed time?
[02:44:02] <newbiee> yeas lets say 3 seconds
[02:44:22] <Cork> i have no clue what your talking about
[02:44:41] <newbiee> sort of likes a news ticker where the text moves up
[02:44:49] <Cork> ah
[02:44:59] <vl1234> @cork cool man............i am think lot like more that 5 lines but it too cool..........i have to go long ..............thankzzzzzzzzzzzz a lot
[02:45:01] <Cork> scrollTop
[02:45:26] <vl1234> @cork cool man............i am think lot like more than 5 lines but its too cool..........i have to go long ..............thankzzzzzzzzzzzz a lot
[02:45:31] <newbiee> can i make that circular like after the end of the line begin again from start
[02:46:01] <Cork> you would have to duplicate the content to do that
[02:46:11] <Cork> or at least the beginning
[02:46:16] <newbiee> hmm
[02:50:12] <newbiee> is there any way i can put html tag at the start and end of a selected text
[03:07:14] <terryleigh> is there a better way to do this? $('#' + canvas_id).attr({

[03:28:38] <jammsen> Guys is there a autocomplete script that works with predefined json data? i mean without an ajax request, just local in the side
[03:28:57] <Aamir> ?jqueryui autocomplete @jammsen
[03:28:58] <bot-t> jammsen, UI/API/1.8/Autocomplete - Documentation - jQuery - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Autocomplete Overview Autocomplete, when added to an input field, enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as t... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete
[03:31:35] <jammsen> Aamir: is there a way to open up all last entries like my latest news(10 entries or so), when i click inside the field?
[03:32:12] <Aamir> jammsen: no idea what you talking about mate :|
[03:33:16] <Aamir> ask a clear question
[03:35:03] <pgherveou> Hi guys just realized something not really related to jquery but I wonder if this is a bug or not
[03:35:03] <pgherveou> if you have a dom element with and id set then it is accessible from  your global scope in webkit browsers
[03:35:03] <pgherveou> so if you go to google and fire the console you can type main or window.main  it will give you the #main element.
[03:35:05] <pgherveou> its kind of a big bug in my opinion,  this could catch error that should throw error. What do you think ?
[03:35:32] <rabbi1> on refresh of the page, the UITab is not loading the first tab, instead loading the last tab...
[03:35:41] <rabbi1> any suggestion ?
[03:36:01] <jammsen> Aamir: ok lets say, i got a news module, easy doing, i got that, but i want to make teaser graphics for the news, so i decided to setup a page where i can add to the best 3 news a teaser graphic to upload. I want to get the last 15 news and make a json array or so, with the data. So when i click inside one textbox, the list appears i select one news entry and can upload a gfx
[03:36:36] <jammsen> best would be, that i could not select the same entry in the next box, you understand where i am going?
[03:36:37] <shoky> pgherveou: what's the bug?
[03:36:49] <shoky> pgherveou: "this could catch error that should throw error" ? huh?
[03:37:04] <pgherveou> I mean it should not exist in the global scope don't you think
[03:37:22] <shoky> says who?
[03:37:30] <Aamir> jammsen:  use jQuery ui autocomplete. it has callback on select element so u can use that
[03:37:58] <pgherveou> I am just trying to figure out if this is normal behavior or not
[03:38:09] <shoky> it is
[03:38:22] <jammsen> Aamir: how to open up the list when i click inside?
[03:38:42] <pgherveou> in my opinion it should not be accessible from the global scope and it does not sem to be the case  in other browsers
[03:38:49] <Aamir> jammsen: let me check
[03:38:54] <shoky> what is your opinion based on
[03:39:01] <jammsen> Aamir: i am not that familiar with that, maybe you got a demo on the hand?
[03:39:09] <shoky> "get off my global lawn"!
[03:39:43] <pgherveou> in fact I had a variable I mistyped in one of my js file and its name matched an id in my dom, so no error were thrown
[03:40:24] <shoky> the global scope already has stuff in it that you didnt put in it. get used to it
[03:40:38] <pgherveou> yop thats right
[03:40:40] <rabbi1> on refresh of the page, the UITab is not loading the first tab, instead loading the last tab... any solution ?
[03:41:10] <Aamir> jammsen: i don't have demo. use jq ui autocomplete and than $('your textbox').focus( function(){    /* use jq ui autocomplete 'search' method to show the menu http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#method-search */   } )
[03:41:15] <shoky> rabbi1: stop asking questions without saying what you are asking about. WTF is a UITab?
[03:41:58] <Aamir> jammsen:  http://gyazo.com/a7f2704d4f1f32794589777c95ed44dd.png?1340879916
[03:42:36] <Aamir> shoky:  he mean jQuery UI Tabs :/
[03:43:06] <Aamir> rabbi1:  you can select any tab manually using tab's select method
[03:43:44] <Aamir> rabbi1:  http://gyazo.com/2099d23345aac363fb9d04179f1a786a.png?1340879568
[03:43:58] <shoky> Aamir: then he should say so :\
[03:44:00] <rabbi1> rabbi1: ok, got it http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/130/
[03:44:20] <Aamir> shoky:  i think UI tab is enough for those who knows jQuery UI tabs.
[03:44:25] <shoky> no, it's not
[03:44:31] <Aamir> it is
[03:44:39] <shoky> there are other tabs plugins too
[03:44:48] <rabbi1> in the above code, on click of third tab the address is taken as /mysite.com/#lasttab. so on refresh its going to lasttab. how i can tackle this ?
[03:44:53] <Aamir> ?jquery ui tabs

[03:45:11] <Aamir> shoky:  ok
[03:45:42] <rabbi1> shoky: sorry, my net had some prob, its stopped and suddenly i got all messages at once .
[03:45:50] <Aamir> ?down http://jsfiddle.net/
[03:45:53] <bot-t> Aamir, It's not just you! - http://404.shtml looks down from here.
[03:45:59] <shoky> eek
[03:46:12] <rabbi1> shoky: other tab plugins? why will someone ask here ?
[03:46:21] <shoky> rabbi1: because they are also jquery plugins
[03:46:41] <rabbi1> shoky: ok :) ... sorry
[03:46:42] <Aamir> stop fighting and answer his question :D
[03:46:51] <shoky> i just did :)
[03:47:26] <shoky> rabbi1: me too, didn't mean to be harsh (or flood you :P)
[03:47:40] <rabbi1> i hope u guys got my problem ?
[03:48:08] <shoky> well jsfiddle is down so it's kinda hard ;p
[03:48:24] <rabbi1> kindly ignore all my previous question
[03:48:52] <rabbi1> jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/129/ on click of third tab the address is taken as /mysite.com/#lasttab. so on refresh its going to lasttab. how i can tackle this ?
[03:49:12] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, even i am experiencing it ... :(
[03:49:18] <rabbi1> very shoky
[03:49:57] <shoky> rabbi1 can you post the code somewhere else?
[03:50:24] <shoky> like jsbin.com
[03:52:35] <rabbi1> shoky: too difficult, got all jquery and all, brb
[03:53:11] <shoky> when i used tabs it didn't change the url in the address bard ;S
[03:53:13] <shoky> bar
[03:54:11] <rabbi1> shoky: http://jsbin.com/afogaz/3/edit
[03:56:18] <rabbi1> shoky: not problem with the js, once clicked on the third tab, without validation on the second tab, works great. but what is happening here may not reflect on that. as i click on the third tab, the address is changed to mysite.com/testpage#ccc. so when i refresh the page. instead of going to mysite.com/testpage  it is redirecting to mysite.com/tespage#ccc . how can i get the default mysite.com/testpage by default on refresh .. ?
[03:57:02] <lionrouge> hi
[03:57:09] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, but in my system it is ... :(
[03:57:23] <serdem> lionrouge, hey
[03:58:17] <lionrouge> tell me please how to compare the text in input field (got by .val() ) with empty string? (need to write an if..else block)
[03:59:24] <lionrouge> i need not equals condition
[03:59:30] <shoky> rabbi1 how do i get it to validate :\
[04:02:37] <serdem> lionrouge,  if(x != y)
[04:02:57] <serdem> lionrouge,  y = ""
[04:03:36] <blackspotwiggins> serdem, cool comparison with =, bro
[04:03:49] <Haprog> lol
[04:04:28] <serdem> blackspotwiggins,  ?
[04:04:29] <lionrouge> serdem, it doesn't work
[04:04:40] <lionrouge> actually i tried exactly what you typed
[04:04:55] <Haprog> *facepalm*
[04:04:59] <shoky> rabbi1: http://antishok.no-ip.org/aaa.htm
[04:05:06] <shoky> it doesnt change the url
[04:05:59] <serdem> lionrouge, it should work. pastebin your code. let me correct it. or blackspotwiggins would in a cool way (?)
[04:06:54] <rabbi1> shoky: checking it, and also, even though one of the input field i have not mentioned as required, but it's still checking for that field, wonder why ...
[04:07:39] <Haprog> serdem: "=" is the assignment operator, not comparison.
[04:08:09] <rabbi1> shoky: it doesn't change the url, but populates with tab a href
[04:08:19] <shoky> rabbi1: are you sure you need the class="required" on the <label> btw
[04:08:35] <serdem> Haprog, so what? i used "!=". it'sa comparision operator.
[04:08:54] <shoky> rabbi1: populates what with what?
[04:09:07] <Haprog> serdem: yes != is a comparison, = however is not.
[04:09:27] <seutje> that's some complex shit, yo!
[04:09:27] <rabbi1> shoky: not really, i can change it to something else..... it's just some styles to it
[04:09:31] <Haprog> I thought you meant this y = "" as a comparison
[04:09:57] <rabbi1> shoky: that name made more sense to use it, but looks like that is causing the problem ....
[04:10:01] <Haprog> but I guess now you meant that y should be "" while making the comparison
[04:10:28] <shoky> rabbi1: it doesn't make sense to use validation markup for your styling
[04:11:13] <serdem> Haprog,  i don't know how you proccess thoughts... cool. kepp it :)
[04:13:41] <rabbi1> shoky: can u be more clear ?
[04:15:00] <juha_> could someone help me, this page seems to be lolling at me and it's no fun :( http://juha.bin.fi/lol.html
[04:16:10] <shoky> rabbi1:  you said that you put class="required" on the <label> because  "it's just some styles to it"
[04:16:31] <shoky> rabbi1: i'm saying that since class="required" is part of the validation markup, don't use it for styling an element that you're not even validating
[04:16:54] <shoky> rabbi1: i.e. just put it on the <input>
[04:17:01] <rabbi1> shoky: hmm, will change that
[04:17:18] <shoky> (though i am not 100% sure about that, havent used the validation plugin much)
[04:17:23] <rabbi1> shoky: got that....
[04:17:57] <shoky> i still didnt understand your original issue btw. if it doesn't change the url then whats the prob
[04:18:39] <lionrouge> serdem, had a bracket missing ))
[04:19:26] <serdem> lionrouge, i bet you do :) i'm glad it worked.
[04:19:39] <lionrouge> thanks to you
[04:23:51] <rabbi1> shoky: need to work more on that, any way. thanks a lot ....
[04:24:57] <rabbi1> shoky: not the url, when refreshed it's going to the lasttab, not the firsttab, because the address says "mysite.com/tabspage#lasttab..."
[04:27:23] <seutje> juha_: heh, meny lols!
[04:28:21] <phrearch> hm, somehow in firefox scrollWidth is not calculated beyond the containing cell width, while in chrome everything is fine
[04:28:42] <phrearch> compatibility headache :S
[04:35:21] <shoky> rabbi1: address? not url? what?
[04:36:57] <rabbi1> shoky: url
[04:38:40] <jammsen> what is the jquery version for every selectbox do something?
[04:39:24] <jammsen> $("input[type=select]").each(function(){...}); ?
[04:41:35] <juha_> jammsen: what are you trying to achieve? each might be unnecessary
[04:42:06] <jammsen> i got 3 comboboxes on my side
[04:42:13] <jammsen> i want to initialize them
[04:42:14] <ryanpilbeam> if I have a few inputs within a form, I want to process a change on the inputs, i'm doing $('input').change(function() { // my code }); - but if the user changes a value and doesn't click off the input and clicks straight onto the submit, the change function doesn't process, can I have $('form').submit(function() { // trigger the change or something.. });
[04:42:38] <jammsen> juha_ : like $( "#combobox" ).combobox();
[04:42:50] <jammsen> but for each select
[04:43:06] <jammsen> every select has an unique id
[04:44:40] <NodeX> $("select").combobox(); ??
[04:45:22] <Cork> ryanpilbeam: or you can trigger it on keyup
[04:45:26] <shoky> rabbi1:  you say 'not the url', but yes the address. then you say 'url'.  :\
[04:46:17] <Cork> ryanpilbeam: though you still want to have the change event for if users past things in the text field
[04:47:35] <juha_> jammsen: $("input[type=select]").combobox()  should do it if the plugin has been made correctly
[04:47:53] <jammsen> $( "select" ).each(function(){ $(this).combobox(); });
[04:47:57] <jammsen> works
[04:47:57] <juha_> no
[04:48:01] <jammsen> i got more then 1
[04:48:01] <juha_> stupid and slow
[04:49:14] <juha_> jammsen: it should (if the plugin has been made correctly) work with just $("select").combobox() like NodeX suggested
[04:50:21] <jammsen> juha_: but it simply dont work
[04:50:53] <jammsen> the plugin is from jquery devs
[04:51:18] <juha_> it's from 2007?
[04:51:26] <jammsen> just downloaded
[04:51:46] <juha_> http://jquery.sanchezsalvador.com/page/jquerycombobox.aspx this one?
[04:52:08] <jammsen> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[04:52:10] <jammsen> that one
[04:52:32] <juha_> ohh ok lol, let's see
[04:52:50] <varu> hello
[04:52:54] <varu> hi
[04:53:10] <varu> hello
[04:53:11] <NodeX> bye
[04:53:32] <varu> see u
[04:53:43] <NodeX> bye then
[05:01:45] <rabbi1> shoky: i just wanted to type url in the address bar ..... which is also a address
[05:02:06] <shoky> type what url..
[05:02:09] <rabbi1> shoky: anyway, we are talking something irrelevent .... aren't we ?
[05:02:25] <shoky> i dont know, your issue was with the url changing, wasn't it :\
[05:06:17] <rabbi1> shoky: yes, as mentioned. ....., when refreshed it's going to the lasttab, not the firsttab, because the address says "mysite.com/tabspage#lasttab..."  url also, meant address here
[05:06:59] <shoky> rabbi1: then why did you say:  <rabbi1> shoky: it doesn't change the url, but populates with tab a href
[05:07:40] <shoky> does the url change or not
[05:08:25] <jeffsmykil> Im trying to access a non-private method from outside a widget and I can't figure out how to make it happen, this is the syntac im currently trying: $("#statusHistoryContainer").timeline("animationCounter('test')");
[05:08:53] <shoky> rabbi1: i used your code and it doesnt change the url , doesnt add any #lasttab to the url.
[05:09:32] <rabbi1> shoky: is it? oops, then i will have to figure it out.... #lasttab here means #ddd
[05:09:49] <rabbi1> shoky: ok, will have a good look....
[05:09:59] <seutje> jeffsmykil: got a link to this timeline plugin ur using?
[05:10:03] <shoky> rabbi1 huh. i linked you before to show you that it doesnt change the url
[05:10:14] <jeffsmykil> seutje: all custom in house code
[05:10:30] <rabbi1> shoky: that link was doing nothing .... :(
[05:10:36] <seutje> kinda impossible for me to know how to address it
[05:10:43] <shoky> rabbi1: that link just had your code :\
[05:10:53] <jeffsmykil> seutje: is my syntax right?
[05:11:07] <seutje> but I'ma guess it'd be .timeline('animationCounter', {paramName: paramValue});
[05:11:10] <jeffsmykil> if there is a function called animationCounter inside the timeline widget?
[05:11:23] <jeffsmykil> gret
[05:11:25] <jeffsmykil> ill try that
[05:11:27] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[05:11:31] <seutje> jeffsmykil: it really depends on how it's written
[05:11:37] <rabbi1> shoky: nope, nothing, gave some not found error, any way. that's ok :)
[05:11:42] <seutje> for all I know it just evals whatever you throw at it
[05:12:01] <shoky> oh
[05:12:20] <glauco29> hi
[05:13:01] <jeffsmykil> i know its hard to give advice blind seutje I appreciate it
[05:13:06] <shoky> rabbi1:  http://antishok.no-ip.org:24010/aaa.htm
[05:13:31] <Francis47> Hey all - i have a problem with a floating div usig this: http://pastebin.com/2fGPN2X6
[05:14:06] <rabbi1> shoky: that link is not checking for validations, missing jsfiddle badly
[05:14:24] <shoky> rabbi1: what do the validations have to do with the tabs and the url changing..
[05:14:25] <Francis47> how can i force another class when the div hits the first underlying div?
[05:14:35] <shoky> rabbi1: with your validations i couldn't switch tabs at all
[05:14:35] <glauco29> I get statusText=error in an ajax request using jquery.ajax, how Can I know what is wrong?? Url is correct, I realized that If I remove return true from end of my function ajax request works fine else it fails sometimes
[05:15:25] <shoky> glauco29: return true from the end of what function?
[05:15:41] <glauco29> shoky: I will paste it
[05:16:02] <rabbi1> shoky: ha, then it will not change the url i guess, u can switch the tabs, once you enter the value in second field, and big problem is missing css which differentiates the required field and not required field. oops, i should have added internal styles for it.
[05:16:25] <rabbi1> shoky: extremely sorry. i will check out and if not found, will wait for jsfiddle ;)
[05:16:31] <rabbi1> shoky: thanks a lot.....
[05:16:38] <shoky> rabbi1: i couldnt swtich tabs even if i filled all the fields in
[05:17:04] <glauco29> shoky: http://pastebin.com/4gkbksZF
[05:18:46] <rabbi1> shoky: oops, that's someting wrong
[05:19:03] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you awake?
[05:20:00] <rabbi1> shoky: and can u see the validateTab function ?
[05:20:38] <seutje> jeffsmykil: barely, if even
[05:21:11] <shoky> glauco29: what's the 'return true' for?
[05:21:53] <jeffsmykil> seutje: that's very sneak
[05:21:56] <jeffsmykil> sneaky
[05:22:02] <glauco29> I want execute this ajax request and after, follow with href from link
[05:22:32] <seutje> glauco29: u'll have to do that in the success callback
[05:23:07] <shoky> ^^
[05:23:28] <shoky> glauco29: you either want to follow the link or you dont
[05:23:45] <seutje> or I suppose you could have your function return the jqXHR object and poll it to see if it's finished, but that's just silly
[05:23:49] <shoky> glauco29: if you want to follow it, asynchronous ajax calls wont work
[05:24:06] <glauco29> I want follow link after ajax request
[05:24:12] <shoky> no
[05:24:15] <shoky> as i just said
[05:24:20] <shoky> you either want to follow it, or you dont
[05:24:44] <shoky> so, you dont want to follow it. you want to start an ajax request. later on, maybe you want to redirect the page
[05:24:45] <seutje> shoky: why wouldn't you be able to follow it after completing the ajax request?
[05:24:53] <seutje> oh like that
[05:24:55] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ seutje
[05:24:56] <bot-t> seutje, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[05:25:12] <glauco29> one moment
[05:25:20] <glauco29> I have performed it successfully
[05:25:23] <glauco29> First
[05:25:24] <seutje> thanks, but that doesn't do anything about the confusion your wording created
[05:25:45] <shoky> seutje: because you have already returned from the click handler
[05:25:53] <seutje> so?
[05:25:57] <shoky> seutje: so the 'follow the link' is not an option anymore
[05:26:17] <glauco29> First I call a link via AJAX, after I follow my link
[05:26:22] <seutje> just preventDefault in the click and go to the href in the ajax success callback
[05:26:36] <shoky> seutje: that is what i meant by "maybe later you want to redirect the page"
[05:26:40] <shoky> seutje: that is not "following the link"
[05:26:51] <seutje> that's what I meant by "the confusion created by your wording"
[05:27:03] <shoky> hence my explanation..
[05:27:07] <seutje> imo, that's still following a link, just delayed
[05:27:19] <Naeblis> hi. I want to hide a div if I click somewhere else on screen, but it's also a dropdown, so it should work when visible. How can I achieve that?
[05:27:22] <shoky> well thats your opinion ;>
[05:27:35] <seutje> that's like saying you can't submit a form and validate it via an ajax call to the backend
[05:27:40] <shoky> its not following the link because the link has already been clicked and the click has been handled.
[05:27:47] <seutje> while there's a bunch of plugins designed just to do that
[05:27:48] <fRAiLtY-> If you click the white snow scene image http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing underneath the leaf image, it should swap them over or at least show the snow scene in big in place of the leafs, I'm getting this Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'hide' of undefined when I click it now :x
[05:28:07] <shoky> seutje: i explained my wording, take it or leave it ;p
[05:28:08] <seutje> shoky: so it's not following the default click behavior
[05:28:20] <seutje> it's still following the link if that's where you end up
[05:28:41] <glauco29> shoky: It is possible, I can perform an ajax request before follow link, I have already performed it in other cases
[05:28:43] <shoky> it's redirecting the page to a url which happens to be taken from that link
[05:28:52] <shoky> whatever, semantics..
[05:28:58] <LordThumper> Hey. How do I set the jQuery UI tab persistance cookie to be a session cookie?
[05:29:13] <seutje> glauco29: u can't call it follow or he won't answer
[05:29:30] <shoky> glauco29: you already got your answer, do it in the callback
[05:29:44] <glauco29> callback does not wokr
[05:29:47] <glauco29> work*
[05:29:51] <shoky> it give EROR
[05:30:03] <glauco29> it is online
[05:30:06] <seutje> BORKEN CLALBAKC!
[05:30:41] <shoky> glauco29: and don't forget to preventDefault()
[05:30:44] <glauco29> http://superabelha.com.br/teste/busca?palavra-chave=dvd click in the first yellow button and see it with firebug console
[05:30:58] <shoky> glauco29: you can forget about "return true/false" for the most part when handling events with jquery
[05:31:05] <seutje> watch, he'll say his chrome doesn't have firebug
[05:32:12] <glauco29> While handling links, it must return true or false to continue or stop
[05:32:27] <seutje> who decided this?
[05:32:46] <glauco29> If I change return true by return false my ajax request works
[05:32:59] <glauco29> But I cannot return false
[05:33:03] <seutje> why not?
[05:33:08] <glauco29> cause I have to follow link after ajax request
[05:33:12] <seutje> why do u even have to return anything?
[05:33:15] <seutje> again, who decided this?
[05:33:16] <shoky> glauco29: dont return anything
[05:33:35] <seutje> just event.preventDefault() and handle ur shizzle in your AJAX success/error handlers
[05:33:40] <shoky> glauco29:  do event.preventDefault() preferably as first statement in your handler
[05:34:09] <seutje> (you'll have to add event as a parameter to the event handler though)
[05:34:24] <glauco29> I know
[05:34:27] <shoky> not neccessarily :P (but preferably yes)
[05:34:40] <seutje> u don't?
[05:34:42] <glauco29> But, after my ajax request
[05:34:50] <glauco29> I have to follow for href from link
[05:35:00] <shoky> seutje: you can just deal with window.event
[05:35:32] <seutje> is that safe?
[05:35:43] <shoky> less, i suppose :P
[05:35:47] <seutje> something else could have defined a global with that name, no?
[05:35:59] <shoky> yeah, i didnt say you should do it like that ;p
[05:36:37] <seutje> hmz, didn't know this was exposed in a globalcontext like that
[05:36:45] <seutje> prolly better that I didn't know :P
[05:36:50] <shoky> yeah that's how you deal with events without jquery
[05:36:56] <shoky> and that's how jquery deals with events ;p
[05:37:30] <Nece228> hello
[05:37:52] <seutje> oh, I thought regular old javamascripts already had the event as first parameter to the handler
[05:37:56] <Nece228> how to select only numbers when i do .attr('name')
[05:38:06] <xec> seutje: yes i think so too
[05:38:13] <glauco29> take a look: http://pastebin.com/yz7zggUZ
[05:38:14] <xec> seutje: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-EventListener
[05:38:14] <Nece228> the name attribute has value: "productquantity[1, 3]"
[05:38:27] <rabbi1> var tab = $(".tabDiv");  will this pass only the element with class name to tab inside "var validateTab = function(tab) " ?
[05:38:36] <seutje> xec: ah, cool, saved me a google query :D
[05:38:42] <shoky> yeah sorry, my bad
[05:38:47] <xec> seutje: the window.event is an IE thing i believe
[05:39:01] <xec> dunno if it's implemented in other browsers too though
[05:39:19] <shoky> it is
[05:39:50] <seutje> cool
[05:39:54] <seutje> never seen it being used
[05:40:53] <mazzachre> If I want to enhance some fields on a page, should I envoke the enhancer methods in document.load or should I wait til document.ready?
[05:41:12] <seutje> depends
[05:41:20] <seutje> you should prolly just put it at the bottom
[05:41:57] <seutje> otherwise, doc rdy unless u need images and stuff to be loaded, but then window.load isn't rly that reliable either, with caching and stuff, but there's a plugin somewhere for proper window.load handling
[05:41:58] <mazzachre> It is a std. included javascript file... so I can't put it in the bottom (It will always be included in the header of pages shown
[05:42:38] <seutje> don't rly see that as a reason you can't put it at the bottom, but I'm sure you have your reasons
[05:42:40] <shoky> rabbi1: what?
[05:42:58] <shoky> rabbi1: how are you calling validateTAb..
[05:42:59] <mazzachre> It is nothing special, just a few jquery.ui and my own jquery.ui based enhancements... Stuff like date-time pickers and such.
[05:43:52] <DomeMaster> Hello
[05:43:57] <seutje> mazzachre: yea, pretty sure they do their own handling when needed, u just have to make sure the doc is rdy so the element exists
[05:44:20] <DomeMaster> I want a design, where I ask a series of questions ( maybe in different stages ).
[05:44:57] <DomeMaster> I want it to be informative and easy to use for first time people, but for powerusers there are still ways to enter the infor quickly/effciently
[05:45:23] <DomeMaster> do you have any designs you could suggest that would inspire me with this problem?
[05:45:29] <Francis47> can someone help me identify the script running the behaviour of the div holding the "share" function in the left sidebar on this page: http://www.bt.dk/danmark/tog-loven-i-egen-haand-her-stopper-borgerne-trafikken-i-doedskrydset
[05:45:41] <Francis47> The scrolling behaviour
[05:49:59] <rabbi1> shoky: i am ok with that, done and finished. ... :)
[05:50:03] <Xotix>  hi
[05:50:56] <Xotix> i have a div which is contenteditable with a given width. e.g. 200px. Now, if you make one big word which is bigger than this 200px the div gets bigger. is it possible to make an auto break?
[05:51:32] <shoky> Francis47 i've heard good things about http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[05:52:24] <shoky> Francis47: and you can just look for "sticky scroll" plugins
[05:52:35] <shoky> such as johnkpaul's
[05:52:59] <shoky> Francis47: or are you looking for the exact one used on that page
[05:53:08] <shoky> rabbi1: glad to hear
[05:53:59] <Francis47> Iam looking for a similar functionality of that on the page
[05:54:52] <Francis47> i got the fixed position already using this: http://pastebin.com/cDPHzWjE
[05:55:37] <Francis47> but i need to stop the div when it hits the top of the underlying divs
[05:55:42] <Francis47> like a footer
[05:55:45] <Francis47> or something :)
[05:59:35] <shoky> Francis47 this is what that site is using http://pastebin.com/b3BADpr3
[06:01:29] <poppiez> hi, anyone else getting an incorrect $(window).width() value on android browsers like HTC Legend?
[06:01:43] <poppiez> I was looking at window.outerWidth, which gives the correct value but it isn't really the same
[06:05:47] <Xotix> poppiez you could read it from the styles attribute with regex.
[06:06:59] <rabbi1> shoky: else, very shoky ?
[06:08:59] <poppiez> Xotix: hmm, no other way?
[06:09:27] <shoky> rabbi1: what? ;)
[06:10:27] <Xotix> poppiez idk. i' ve came across this before and ended up with that. anyway, i currently need it right now too.  width gets the calculated with. but i don't know what it cares about. I need to get the width which is set in the style attribute, is this possible?
[06:11:02] <Xotix> poppiez http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9604118/get-width-height-of-img-with-js-no-calculated-styles
[06:21:03] <rabbi1> shoky: gtg time's up, take care
[06:21:09] <rabbi1> :)
[06:22:03] <shoky> buhbye
[06:23:01] <Zhy> is there a better, more readable way to replace elements with much html content than to write long one liners with all the html ?
[06:23:36] <Nece228> how to know whats inside the array without looping it?
[06:25:57] <shoky> Nece228: what?
[06:26:11] <Nece228> whatever
[06:26:15] <Nece228> nervous day
[06:26:18] <shoky> Nece228: the cat is either dead or it isn't
[06:26:28] <shoky> or both
[06:26:31] <shoky> or smth.
[06:26:41] <ElGoorf> hi guys
[06:27:03] <Nece228> i have a tr in which there are lots of td and i need to select certain td
[06:27:08] <Nece228> how to do this ?
[06:29:23] <webdev> hello all
[06:29:35] <shoky> Nece228: what do you mean by "a certain td"
[06:29:38] <webdev> is it possible to create a click on a certain option within a seelect?
[06:29:40] <webdev> select*
[06:30:15] <crazyzf> hi, how can i check whether a attribut ... exists?
[06:30:54] <ElGoorf> i have a search field, and on every keyup() it fires off a request (getJSON) for search results and displays them as recommendations. this has 2 problems. 1) waste of queries 2) the results don't necessarily come back in the same order they were requested, so a result might be overwritten with an earlier one, so a) is there a plugin that detects pauses in between keystrokes and b) how do i abort a getJSON request?
[06:31:07] <Nece228> shoky: <tr> <td><input name="needtoselectthisone"></td> <td><input name="thisonetoo"></td> <td><input name="dontneedthisone"></td> </tr>
[06:32:07] <shoky> Nece228: $('td').has('input[name=needtoselectthisone]')
[06:32:50] <shoky> or - $('input[name=bla]').parent('td')
[06:32:56] <Nece228> thanks ill try
[06:33:05] <Nece228> my head doesnt work today no matter what i do
[06:33:26] <shoky> if you need to select multiple td's.. use a class for the ones you'll wanna select
[06:34:31] <sonnie> hey, i'm trying to send request to server and get JSON data. Direct access to url is correct(for example, {"data":"123"}). but when i write in JS like this:  $.getJSON(url, function(json){ alert(json.value); }), i can't get "123". why?
[06:35:13] <Cork> wait json.value contains data?!?
[06:35:22] <Cork> that doens't make sence
[06:35:36] <sonnie> oh mispell, should be "value":"123"
[06:35:42] <Cork> yes thats expected
[06:35:47] <Cork> what did you expect?
[06:36:08] <sonnie> i think json.value should be 123
[06:36:20] <Cork> your sending a string
[06:36:29] <Cork> {"data":123} would be a number
[06:37:19] <sonnie> {"value":"123"} is the JSON data returned by access to url.
[06:37:37] <Cork> ya the key value with the string "123"
[06:37:37] <MysterOnyx> I have an h3 tag and and div associated with a specific object. What's the best way to actually associate them with the object? Should I give the h3 and div the same class that says something like class='object1'? Or is there a better way to do it? As an example, what I want to is make it so that when the h3 is clicked, properties of object1 will be AJAXed. Or if the div is clicked, I want
[06:37:37] <MysterOnyx> something else to happen with object1's properties. But somehow I have to make it so it knows the h3 and div are assigned to object1...
[06:37:40] <Cork> not the number 123
[06:38:08] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"value":"123"}').value
[06:38:11] <bot-t> Cork: "123"
[06:38:13] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"value":123}').value
[06:38:14] <bot-t> Cork: 123
[06:39:06] <shoky> <confused
[06:39:47] <Cork> shoky: about what?
[06:40:03] <shoky> mm it didn't seem to me that he's asking why he gets 123 and not "123"
[06:40:06] <shoky> or was he?
[06:40:16] <Cork> he was
[06:40:23] <sonnie> i got nothing :(
[06:40:26] <shoky> <sonnie> i think json.value should be 123
[06:40:35] <Cork> 'oh mispell, should be "value":"123"' '<sonnie> i think json.value should be 123'
[06:41:11] <shoky> sonnie, you get an empty alert?
[06:41:28] <sonnie> alert even didn't appear
[06:41:37] <Cork> ah
[06:41:39] <shoky> ;p
[06:41:42] <Cork> -_-'
[06:41:54] <Cork> sonnie: you setting the correct mimetype on the response?
[06:42:10] <Cork> Content-Type: application/json
[06:43:11] <sonnie> the JSON data is created by php: $arr['value']="123";return json_encode($arr);
[06:44:02] <Cork> add header('Content-Type: application/json');
[06:44:05] <Cork> before that
[06:44:52] <Cork> your sending text/html right now and thats not what you want
[06:45:45] <shoky> the mimetype matters if you set dataType ?
[06:45:56] <shoky> i mean dataTYpe on the $.ajax request
[06:46:01] <Cork> yes
[06:46:17] <Cork> jquery picks the parser based on what the content-type says
[06:46:29] <shoky> hm
[06:47:07] <shoky> isn't that just the default functionality, if you don't specify dataType?
[06:47:49] <Cork> that used to work, but i haven't gotten it to work in later versions
[06:48:06] <shoky> oh
[06:48:26] <Cork> looks like it changed in 1.5 or 1.6
[06:48:39] <Cork> i jumped from 1.4 to 1.7 so not sure
[06:48:40] <sonnie> but in json_encode's manual , there is no need to claim that?
[06:49:05] <Cork> json_encode doesn't render anything
[06:49:19] <Cork> so it doens't specify whats need to be used on the response header
[06:49:37] <Cork> but heck just add the line, if it works you know
[06:49:45] <Cork> its like 4 sec editing
[06:49:57] <Cork> we've been arguing about it longer then testing would take
[06:50:15] <sonnie> i see. it just creates a data structure. but for sending response, it is another thing.
[06:50:43] <Cork> sonnie: and to be clear, i don't think the json spec demands it
[06:50:50] <Cork> though there is a json mimetype
[06:50:56] <Cork> so when your sending json you should use it
[06:51:08] <sonnie> i see. thank you
[07:00:25] <crazyzf> hi, how can i check whether a attribut ... exists?
[07:01:37] <shoky> Cork, this is what i meant: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fwMSF/3/  the mimetype is text/html but since the dataType is json is parses it as json
[07:01:41] <crazyzf> $(h3 .name full).length is an option but when the attribut full not exist it throws me an error
[07:01:56] <shoky> (fiddle is slow now but it'll load)
[07:02:05] <Cork> shoky: i know what you mean, but i've had problem with that
[07:02:28] <Cork> $.getJSON sets dataType so that should have worked if that was the case
[07:02:40] <shoky> and just changing the response mimetype solved it?
[07:02:49] <Cork> yes
[07:02:59] <shoky> oks. good to know
[07:03:00] <PigDude> crazyzf, typeof el.attr == 'undefined'
[07:03:20] <PigDude> crazyzf, or, typeof jQ.attr('attr') == 'undefined'
[07:03:40] <crazyzf> ok i´ll try thank you
[07:06:08] <johnathanb> How can I fade out a rmoveClass and fadeIn an addClass?
[07:07:03] <crazyzf> i think u have to use on()
[07:08:45] <shoky> seems like a classic case for css3 transitions
[07:39:43] <hariom> I am sending an ajax GET request and it brings back the response from the server. I can see in the firebug that the response has received with the required data from the server. But I don't see Ajax request executing anything in the success function. It was working till 2 days back but suddenly it doesn't even call an alert function soon after calling success: function(resp) { alert('done'); }
[07:40:04] <pascal_> hi guys do any of you know any real cool jquery instant messengers or chatbox utilitys , plugins or alikes?

[07:40:24] <pascal_> im in the need of some inspiration on instant messasing in a jquery based solution
[07:45:06] <hariom> laszlof: Ok, I am resolved it. The bug was I was not sending the json encoded response from the server which the ajax was expecting
[07:48:03] <ThePendulum> Does anyone have jQuery for me? Thanks in advance
[07:49:57] <thang> ಠ_ಠ
[07:50:15] <ThePendulum> Well?
[07:50:32] <ThePendulum> I'm refering to the main file
[07:51:41] <thang> im not gonna ask. ThePendulum: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js
[07:51:49] <ThePendulum> Thanks!
[07:51:56] <blackspotwiggins> .. did that jut happen?
[07:51:59] <blackspotwiggins> just*
[07:51:59] <ThePendulum> Just to be clear, jquery.com is down
[07:52:35] <thang> well hot damn that happened within the last couple of minutes
[07:53:36] <ThePendulum> I don't know if it's down for you guys, but it's down here and isup.me says it's down for *everyone*
[07:53:48] <ThePendulum> Otherwise I would've just gotten it from the website of course
[07:54:06] <hariom> I am receiving response of an ajax query as I see in firebug but soon after the start of success function in ajax code, I check for the error as: if ('error' in resp) { do something } else { do something else }. I get js error saying invalid 'in' operand
[07:54:23] <thang> yeah i had just used the site a second ago and its down now, which leads to the confusion of your request
[07:54:49] <ThePendulum> I should've mentioned before, lol
[07:54:50] <hariom> Is this tip helpful? http://silverbeans.com/post/TypeError-invalid-in-operand-jQuerytemplate.aspx
[07:54:57] <hariom> Has anybody tried?
[07:55:43] <woozly> guys, how to do popup dynamically generated, when I move over some element? (I need something like popup menu)... but I have trouble: I can't understand how to make: mouseout and hide popuped menu. (when mouse out of hovered element and out of menu element)
[07:57:10] <ThePendulum> Could anyone quickly give me a few lines of code to make an element show up on the focus of another element? (In this case a text that says "Press Enter to submit" shown when focused on a textbox).
[07:57:19] <converge> guys, I have this page www.fortunata.com.br/catalogo and I wanna add images to that slider every time the user click next button. So when the user click next I call this $('.imgs_slide').append('<li><img src="http://localhost/fortunata_v3_wp_theme/wp-content/themes/fortunata_v3/images/catalogo_billica_2011-pag-2.jpg" alt="Pagina 3 - 2012-1"/></li>'); but it's not adding the images inside the slider, someone knows why ?
[07:57:36] <ThePendulum> Nevermind, jquery.com is back up
[07:57:48] <Es0teric> ThePendulum you could've just used google apis
[07:58:08] <ThePendulum> What do you mean?
[08:00:01] <RohanBhangui> any one on
[08:00:13] <ThePendulum> 897 people at your disposal
[08:00:17] <ThePendulum> *8
[08:00:44] <RohanBhangui> sry have bad internet so just checking
[08:02:10] <hariom> looks like hasOwnProperty() is more consistent than 'IN'
[08:08:43] <sonnie> still met problem.. php is correct: header('Content-type: application/json');$doc=array("value"=>"123");echo json_encode($doc); but in jquery, it won't be executed: $.getJSON(url, function(json){ alert('here'); })
[08:09:24] <laszlof> sonnie: use .ajax and breakdown the process.
[08:09:47] <sonnie> i have tested json from perl, this code works fine.
[08:12:22] <blackspotwiggins> sonnie, type is also capitalized is content-type

[08:16:36] <blackspotwiggins> gabejacobs, check /topic
[08:18:26] <MysterOnyx> weird, I have an object that goes like x[y].id = 1, and then when I do $.each(x, function(k, v){alert('hi');}); the alert doesn't happen
[08:23:07] <Cork> MysterOnyx: and whats x?
[08:23:12] <Cork> an array of objects?
[08:27:00] <alex88> hello guys, i'm using .ajax and i've set success and error function, when server replies 500 it goes to error, but with 200 it calls error too… this is the code:http://pastebin.com/4MxP1u4z
[08:28:15] <Cork> alex88: try validating your json
[08:28:21] <Cork> ?g jsonlint
[08:28:22] <bot-t> Cork, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[08:28:32] <laszlof> alex88: see what the actual error is that its throwing would be helpful as well
[08:28:34] <alex88> Cork: maybe because the response header is text/html?
[08:28:59] <alex88> Cork: response is always {result:true} in case of success
[08:29:07] <Cork> alex1_: no, that shouldn't trigger the error handler
[08:29:10] <MysterOnyx> Cork well, it's not really an array since the iterations go like x['num1'].id, so it's really an object of objects
[08:29:38] <MysterOnyx> I can echo out x['num1'].id fine, but when I try to run through all of the x's with $.each, nothing happens
[08:29:44] <alex88> laszlof: let me do that
[08:29:56] <Cork> MysterOnyx: ok, so its an object with nested objects
[08:30:01] <MysterOnyx> Cork yeah
[08:30:09] <Cork> MysterOnyx: are you declaring hte object before setting .id ?
[08:30:13] <MysterOnyx> yeah
[08:30:24] <MysterOnyx> id is definitely set since I can alert it
[08:30:35] <MysterOnyx> but running through all of the x's with $.each does nothing
[08:30:59] <Cork> MysterOnyx: could you create a jsfiddle?
[08:31:15] <MysterOnyx> Cork yeah I'll try to
[08:32:51] <alex88> laszlof: Cork: right, forgot to escape the json object property name
[08:32:53] <alex88> thanks
[08:33:25] <gabejacobs> Hey, is it possible to change the data-theme of a <a> tag if it is pressed? (this is kind of a jquery mobile question)
[08:35:37] <Cork> gabejacobs: css :active
[08:35:57] <Cork> or mousedown if you want js
[08:36:48] <gabejacobs> Basically I have a link that plays an mp3. I want it to turn yellow when it plays the mp3, and then go back to normal when the mp3 is done playing

[08:38:35] <MysterOnyx> now this example I made works.. I didn't use my real code because it goes across a few functions. I'll keep working with it
[08:43:29] * Cork pokes jsfiddle
[08:43:38] <Cork> lovely its picked this time to be dead...
[08:47:14] <jarr0dsz> jsfiddle is not working?
[08:47:18] <MysterOnyx> ya it's not

[08:49:32] <Mrpeepers310> Hello all! I'm trying to get a function to return a boolean value. For some reason the return is not sending it back to where the function is called. Here is my code http://pastebin.com/zd9dfu4S
[08:51:30] <Cork> Mrpeepers310: wheres the return?
[08:51:46] <Conic2> hi all, i got an "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: )) " when calling $(":myCustomFilter()")...
[08:52:07] <MysterOnyx> Cork this is blowing my mind...
[08:52:15] <Conic2> the filter works when there's some parameter, but it doesn't even get called when the braces are empty
[08:52:39] <Cork> Conic2: that prob depends on the parser
[08:52:48] <Cork> what happens if you remove the () ?
[08:53:06] <Conic2> i can try
[08:54:10] <Mrpeepers310> Cork: sorry, here is the updated code. http://pastebin.com/4ARmt4S5
[08:54:20] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/4166252 Should the script in lines 35-38 replace the image in the top image tags with the gallery image?

[08:54:46] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing the snow image should replace the leaf image on click right/
[08:57:27] <webdev> laters all
[08:59:00] <Conic2> cork here i got it http://jsfiddle.net/yZbdF/
[08:59:47] <Exx> Hello everyone ! I've got a question: I got two $.post() functions in one .js but it only runs the first one. What's wrong and how can I solve it? Hope this is the right link :D http://jsfiddle.net/Xsq5H/
[08:59:52] <Cork> Conic2: you can't return values through an event
[08:59:52] <Conic2> as soon as the input gets empty, it throws the error
[09:00:16] <tash> anyone in here used DataTables + TableTools?
[09:00:17] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[09:00:31] <Conic2> yup ;)
[09:00:38] <tash> I'm wondering if you can only show the print button
[09:00:49] <tash> reference: http://datatables.net/extras/tabletools/
[09:01:17] <Cork> Mrpeepers310: you can't return values through an event
[09:01:28] <Mrpeepers310> ah ok thank you!
[09:01:44] <Conic2> Someone had a look at my filter example?
[09:01:48] <MysterOnyx> Cork, here is my real code: http://jsbin.com/aduyak/3/edit
[09:02:36] <Cork> Conic2: http://jsfiddle.net/yZbdF/1/
[09:06:35] <Conic2> Cork thanks, this works with empty value but not when i enter this tricky stuff: >>           ") abc            <<
[09:07:06] <Conic2> do you have a hint for me how to pass it correctly if you enter such a "injection" ?
[09:07:11] <MysterOnyx> I don't understand why     alert(foods['food0'].food_id); works and     $.each(foods, function(k, v){alert('??');}); does not
[09:07:17] <Cork> Conic2: well thats why you shouldn't put user data in a selector
[09:07:46] <Cork> MysterOnyx: looking, but my comp is compiling so its a bit slow :)
[09:08:57] <MysterOnyx> ok thanks
[09:09:20] <Cork> MysterOnyx: your using an array to store an object
[09:09:25] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/aduyak/6/edit
[09:09:26] <Conic2> Cork is there something like "Some String with §$%&<(" -> reduceToText() ?
[09:09:54] <Exx> whats that stupid thing with AJAX Request? Yesterday I read about it and that it stops javascript after the request has been finished. How can I tell Javascript to continue with the code after it completed an ajax request?
[09:10:07] <Cork> MysterOnyx: s/foods = [];/foods = {}/ and it works
[09:10:42] <Cork> Conic2: no
[09:11:25] <Cork> you need to escape everything that might be dangers your self
[09:11:42] <Cork> Conic2: but why are you creating the function around sizzle in the first place?
[09:12:40] <javalover> so i'm in gamedev & this guy is talking about resourcing power
[09:12:48] <javalover> and i tell him, you do realize variables are easier to process then graphics
[09:12:59] <javalover> and he's like "umm no I need a quad tree"
[09:13:13] <javalover> and i'm like dude just trust me on this it's easier to process variables then it is to display them
[09:13:21] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/nVnpH/ he ends up having me make him a fiddle
[09:13:32] <javalover> plese do yourself a favor, dont' click on A
[09:13:36] <javalover> but if you click on B it's very fast
[09:13:49] <javalover> WHY? well duh cuz if you try to display everything that you loop through it's slow
[09:13:53] <javalover> jeeze what a moron
[09:14:07] <Conic2> Cork: don't understand your function around sizzle question :o
[09:15:11] <Cork> Conic2: the filters in jquery is handled by a lib called sizzle
[09:15:26] <Conic2> ok
[09:15:27] <Cork> Conic2: when your adding your foction to :selectors you add them to sizzle
[09:15:32] <Cork> *function
[09:15:53] <Cork> instead just extend jquery and return the modified query you want
[09:15:55] <Conic2> ah i see - it's part of my framework, i need it in other places too
[09:16:12] <Conic2> it was just the problematic part of something bigger
[09:16:22] <Cork> if you need to enter users content, i would recommend to not do that
[09:16:54] <Cork> $(selector).myfilter(content).update_commands()
[09:17:01] <Cork> would be a faster and much safer structure
[09:18:21] <MysterOnyx> Cork you're the man!
[09:18:34] <MysterOnyx> or woman.. ?  lol
[09:18:35] <Conic2> you're right, didn't know i can add custom functions to jquery objects
[09:20:50] <Cork> Conic2: $.fn.myfilter = function() { return this.grep(function() { return true; }); };
[09:21:09] <fRAiLtY-> Uncaught TypeError: Object h/i/highrest2.jpeg has no method 'attr' when trying to do this: jQuery("#image").attr("src", this.attr("href")); why?

[09:21:28] <Cork> Conic2: np
[09:21:35] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: whats this?
[09:21:53] <Cork> attr is not a callback so it doesn't set the this variable
[09:22:26] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  http://pastie.org/4166472
[09:22:38] <fRAiLtY-> Lines 334-38
[09:22:39] <Cork> hmm...
[09:22:41] <fRAiLtY-> 34*
[09:22:49] <Cork> my comp smells burnt >_>
[09:23:09] <fRAiLtY-> should update the image with the id of #image with the gallery view just clicked, but I get that attr error in consolve
[09:23:18] <lancealtar> fRAiLtY-: try this jQuery("#image").attr("src", jQuery(this).attr("href"));
[09:23:27] <Cork> fRAiLtY-:  $(this).attr
[09:23:38] <Cork> or ya jQuery()
[09:23:49] <Cork> or this.href
[09:24:09] <lancealtar> this.href is cleaner, IMO
[09:24:48] <Cork> well it doens't really give the same value though
[09:25:04] <fRAiLtY-> oddly, it appends ok but still opens the image in a new window as well wtf??
[09:25:05] <lancealtar> Do tell, Cork
[09:25:05] <Cork> .href gives the fqdn+url
[09:25:24] <Cork> while attr gives whats in the href attribute
[09:25:35] <lancealtar> TIL

[10:01:32] <MysterOnyx> so dot notation is prefered for objects. Such that x['one'].id is better written as x.one.id. What about when it's an array? For x[1].id, can you do x.1.id?
[10:04:29] <roler> can anyone take a look at http://dev.surveysonthego.net/problem.php please? this is using jquery fadeout/fadein. In chrome, the second item that is faded in is offscreen if the first item is scrolled down. just take a look and try it in Chrome
[10:09:22] <sgharms> Hey jQueryists, I was hoping to get a straw poll.  Ought a jQueryists prefer to do method chaining on an element?  $("sel").this().that().theOther() v. var x=$("this"); x.this(); x.that()...etc. ?
[10:09:51] <sgharms> It doesn't seems that there's a computational difference, but is there a convention re: when one ought be adopted
[10:09:53] <shoky> sgharms: it's a matter of personal preferece
[10:10:28] <sgharms> shoky: it feels a bit like ruby's block definition between {} and do/end
[10:10:31] <shoky> i don't think there are any style guidelines telling you whether to chain or not
[10:10:42] <shoky> donno ruby ;p
[10:11:17] <sgharms> {} == do / end;  but when you have multiple lines of things to do within that block Rubyists use do / end.  When it's just a transform, they tend to use {}
[10:11:49] <shoky> no idea what you mean. what's do/end?
[10:12:22] <sgharms> basically words that mean the same thing as a brace.  In JS it'd be like  if (something) do ...things when true .. end
[10:12:27] <shoky> o
[10:13:16] <shoky> well i think in most code you'll see a lot of chaining, but there's always a point when it's too much and you should separate it ;p
[10:14:38] <shoky> MysterOnyx: who says dot notation is preferred?
[10:14:52] <sgharms> shoky: Similar theory on var definition chaining?  var x = 1, bar = function(){...}, bat="larry", bizzle = bar() + 1, snuggleMuffin; ?
[10:15:05] <shoky> sgharms: i'd say so ya
[10:15:27] <sgharms> something fun about JS that you can do the entire work of a method in a variable declaration
[10:15:36] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: no you cannot treat an array like an object in that manner
[10:15:52] <shoky> you can't?
[10:16:14] <shoky> er right
[10:24:44] <alcuadrado> I'm binding an event to some anchor's click, and I want to prevent the default action only in "normal clicks" (no shift-click, ctrl-click, wheel-click), any idea?
[10:39:42] <al_2000> .
[10:47:32] <jeroen_> hello can i ask someone something?
[10:47:35] <snover> no
[10:47:39] <jeroen_> come on
[10:47:41] <jeroen_> please?
[10:47:53] <jeroen_> it is about js query

[10:48:49] <jeroen_> jeroen ben je daar?
[10:48:59] <jeroen_> ja ik ben er
[10:49:18] <jeroen_> hello anybody can help me?
[10:49:30] <NoiseEee> jeroen_: just ask, don't ask to ask
[10:50:31] <lancealtar> !ask
[10:50:37] <lancealtar> ?ask
[10:50:38] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:51:09] <jeroen_> Ok well I will give a try
[10:51:16] <jeroen_> This is my website: http://bestanden.square7.ch/wordpress/
[10:51:22] <jeroen_> there is a countdown on it
[10:51:38] <jeroen_> The text beneath it is in English
[10:51:45] <jeroen_> I want to translate it to dutch
[10:52:14] <jeroen_> the countdown script is this one: jquery.countdown.min.js
[10:52:39] <jeroen_> I could download a translation: jquery.countdown-nl.js
[10:52:45] <jeroen_> but i do not know how to fix it
[10:53:13] <jeroen_> maybe some can help me get the english text "Hours" , "Seconds" "Minutes" etc
[10:53:20] <jeroen_> transtlated to Dutch
[10:53:22] <lancealtar> Where are you getting the jquery plugin from?
[10:53:28] <jeroen_> hang on
[10:54:19] <jeroen_> http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html
[10:54:44] <lancealtar> Have you tried downloading the Dutch version, uploading it to your server and renaming it to the current one?
[10:57:53] <engaged> Is there a way to disable a form so it can only submit once a certain field is filled out and once its filled out it activates it to submit?
[10:58:01] <jeroen_> yes not working... if you look inside you also see there is a big difference between them
[10:58:12] <lancealtar> ?.submit() engaged
[10:58:14] <bot-t> lancealtar, Couldn't find ".submit() engaged" in jQuery Docs.
[10:58:18] <lancealtar> ?.submit engaged
[10:58:20] <bot-t> lancealtar, Couldn't find ".submit engaged" in jQuery Docs.
[10:58:35] <lancealtar> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[10:59:09] <jeroen_> Are you talking to me lace altar?
[10:59:17] <jeroen_> lancealtar
[10:59:24] <jeroen_> i not understand ?.submit
[11:00:10] <cohitre> ? submit @ engaged
[11:00:11] <bot-t> engaged, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[11:00:45] <tippenein> When I have the jquery 1.7.1 linked, my jquery doesn't complain about Object doesn't have 'prop' method, but it breaks my other jquery and says Object has no method 'dialog'.  Is this most likely a version problme?
[11:00:51] <tippenein> problem*
[11:01:16] <silverwind> tippenein, it's likely that you're trying to call .prop on a native DOM node.
[11:02:15] <tippenein> but I'm wondering why I get alternating errors depending on which jquery i link
[11:03:18] <tippenein> Could I change the line that uses input.prop('disabled') to some other method?
[11:04:16] <lancealtar> jeroen_: Have you tried simply adding the additional script after the loading of the first script?
[11:05:17] <NoiseEee> tippenein: a) .prop is a >=1.6 thing;  b) why wouldn't you upgrade jquery instead of moving code backwards?
[11:05:43] <engaged> worked
[11:05:51] <engaged> how do I check if an id that is a checkbox is checked?
[11:05:56] <tippenein> NoiseEee: If it was only my code, I would just upgrade.
[11:06:13] <tippenein> NoiseEee: but knowing it is >=1.6 things is valuable, thanks
[11:06:18] <engaged> if($("#checkBox :checked)) { //good }
[11:06:19] <engaged> ?
[11:06:19] <lancealtar> engaged: $('#id').is(":checked")
[11:06:19] <NoiseEee> tippenein: you could use .attr then i suppose
[11:06:24] <jeroen_> Lancealtar....how do i do that?
[11:06:39] <HardFu> guys, can I kindly ask you to fill this online outsourcing survey for web developers? https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2FTRC55
[11:06:48] <tippenein> so.. $s/prop/attr    ?
[11:06:55] <lancealtar> jeroen_: I'm not familiar enough with Wordpress to help you there.
[11:06:58] <HardFu> we are working on an outsourcing portal and we'd like some input from the community
[11:07:06] <tippenein> It's probably just going to break more stuff
[11:07:46] <tippenein> Or I'm maybe better off updating what the other jquery is using to use 1.7.1 stuff
[11:07:54] <jeroen_> Can anybody help me with a Wordpress problem?
[11:08:24] <jeroen_> Can anybody help me with WORDPRESS and jquery?
[11:08:41] <lancealtar> jeroen_: How did you get the initial script added to the page/
[11:10:39] <jeroen_> the script you see now is just part of the theme
[11:11:47] <lancealtar> jeroen_: Have you tried asking your question about adding a script to Wordpress in #wordpress ?
[11:14:57] <MysterOnyx> at page load, I run several AJAX calls in separate functions. I need to populate objects with this AJAX data, but I don't want the populating functions to run until all of the AJAX calls are complete. I know how to do individual success: calls, but how do I wait until several AJAX calls are successful?
[11:15:47] <jeroen_> lancealtar i will try that THANK YOU
[11:15:58] <cohitre> MysterOnyx: why do you have to wait for all of them?
[11:16:37] <MysterOnyx> cohitre because the data being loaded from them is what's being put into the objects. If I don't wait, then the function to populate the objects may not have any data to populate with
[11:16:59] <cohitre> you can trigger the ajax calls inside the success calls
[11:17:32] <MysterOnyx> so you mean like a domino effect where once one is done, start the next, then when that's done start the next, then when the final one is done, populate the objects?
[11:17:37] <cohitre> yes.
[11:17:53] <MysterOnyx> yeah I can
[11:18:00] <cohitre> the next ajax call gets called when the dependency is meat.
[11:19:00] <silverwind> Beef meat?
[11:19:03] <MysterOnyx> I'll stick with that, cohitre, thanks
[11:19:25] <silverwind> MysterOnyx, You would use $.when for that
[11:20:01] <MysterOnyx> silverwind I'll look up $.when, thanks
[11:20:04] <silverwind> :)
[11:22:26] <tippenein> is dialog a method in 1.7.1? or why would I have Object has no method 'dialog' ?
[11:23:18] <silverwind> MysterOnyx, I haven't tested but it would look like that http://jsfiddle.net/BNeRN/
[11:23:34] <NoiseEee> jqueryui, tippenein
[11:23:44] <MysterOnyx> brilliant, silverwind.
[11:25:24] <tippenein> NoiseEee: Oh! I should be looking at jqueryui!? That makes sense. I think ours is custom
[11:32:07] <tippenein> nah, it's stock 1.8.16 jqueryui
[11:52:19] <Beta2K> Hello all
[11:52:48] <MysterOnyx> hi
[11:53:54] <Beta2K> I'm having troubles getting a ajax load to happen, I don't see any errors in my java console, but I'm not sure if maybe it's wordpress blocking me since I couldn't get a iframe to work either
[11:53:59] <MysterOnyx> can someone explain why load_meal_foods would be running before load_meals()? http://jsfiddle.net/BNeRN/1/
[11:54:12] <Beta2K> The site is http://robertbrucemusic.com/ibtl_blog.php
[11:58:28] <jedimind_> i might be having a brain fart, but if i set a .data attribute on an element
[11:58:34] <code_ph0y> hi people has jquery added a toJson function yet?
[11:58:37] <jedimind_> how do i find that element if it's only got the data attribute
[11:59:02] <jedimind_> i cant do [data-name="something"] because .data doesnt actually create a data attr afaik
[12:00:08] <shoky> jedimind_: i'd use .filter for that. of course, it'd be better to give them an id/class and select using that
[12:01:24] <NoiseEee> jedimind_: yeah in those cases where i know i'll need to search by data attribute, i use data- attributes.
[12:01:45] <NoiseEee> jedimind_: fwiw i find them just way more flexible in general than .data() which is a 'nice feature' i suppose
[12:01:56] <NoiseEee> at least regarding its interaction with the data- attribute
[12:02:25] <jedimind_> yeah, at one point .data used to actually create data- attribute in the DOM
[12:02:27] <jedimind_> but not any mores
[12:02:33] <NoiseEee> sadface
[12:02:41] <shoky> i prefer it this way
[12:03:02] <MysterOnyx> silverwind, when isn't working
[12:04:23] <shoky> MysterOnyx: what do those functions look like
[12:04:33] <MysterOnyx> shoky the best layout is like this: http://jsfiddle.net/BNeRN/2/
[12:04:41] <MysterOnyx> best = basic
[12:04:55] <Whirl3d> if you are loading content via ajax (or .load) that has initializing scripts bound to doc.ready, how do you a) determine that and b) fire then on the newly loaded partial content?
[12:05:21] <shoky> MysterOnyx jsfiddle isnt loading now :\ cant see your 2nd link
[12:05:38] <MysterOnyx> shoky what's happening is load_meal_foods() is running before the $.ajax in load_meals() is done
[12:05:43] <MysterOnyx> shoky is loads for me now
[12:05:52] <MysterOnyx> just slow
[12:06:00] <shoky> you need to return $.ajax
[12:06:03] <shoky> not just call it
[12:06:11] <MysterOnyx> hmm
[12:07:02] <shoky> otherwise all you're doing is $.when(undefined, undefined) :P
[12:07:20] <MysterOnyx> makes sense
[12:10:14] <shoky> btw you could probably just do .done( load_meal_foods )  without the extra anonymous function
[12:10:17] <code_ph0y> anyone?
[12:11:02] <MysterOnyx> shoky what's code for returning ajax? I'm looking it up online but can't figure it out
[12:11:31] <shoky> MysterOnyx:  just pop a 'return' before it.. silverwind's fiddle shows it
[12:11:38] <shoky> return $.ajax(...);
[12:12:36] <MysterOnyx> oh jeez
[12:12:38] <MysterOnyx> thanks
[12:12:46] <shoky> code_ph0y:  you have JSON.stringify
[12:13:25] <MysterOnyx> works now, shoky. Thanks
[12:14:20] <code_ph0y> thanks just seen that on the web
[12:23:34] <xid> I have an element, #myID, that displays on every page, but I am unable to select it on only one of the pages for some reason. I can alert() inside of my $(document).ready(), so I know jQuery is loaded, but not inside of an if ($('#myID').  Using inspector, I can clearly see that <div id="myID"> exists.
[12:23:44] <xid> there are no javascript errors
[12:24:04] <xid> could this occur simply by having an invalid html?  perhaps an unended <div> or somehting?
[12:24:11] <xid> i can see that my <div> is ended properly
[12:24:24] <xid> but I'm working on a horrid pre-built system
[12:25:09] <Whirl3d> simple question: if I add an array to the prototype of on object and then later, in an instance of the object, I wanted to add something to that array, it would be available to all of the items sharing that prototype, correct?
[12:25:15] <ThrushAAX> xid: in inspector did you try the jquery query and you got the element back?
[12:27:11] <xid> ThrushAAX: yes
[12:27:14] <xid> no
[12:27:16] <xid>  I mean
[12:27:18] <shoky> xid:  what is  if ($('#myID').   ?
[12:27:22] <xid> it does not find the elemet
[12:27:33] <xid> shoky: it is a conditional statement
[12:27:36] <xid> it's null
[12:27:38] <shoky> doesn't look like one
[12:27:39] <xid> undefined
[12:27:50] <xid> why not?
[12:27:59] <shoky> it looks like it could be the beginning of one...
[12:28:12] <shoky> but you didnt close the parentheses, for one..
[12:28:22] <ThrushAAX> I assume you meant if ( $("#myID").length ) {... }
[12:28:32] <xid> if ($('fine
[12:28:34] <xid> fine
[12:28:36] <xid> but you get the picture
[12:28:41] <shoky> no i didn't
[12:28:41] <xid> ThrushAAX: yes
[12:28:47] <xid> thanks for ignoring the troll
[12:28:58] <shoky> huh. you didnt show the full code you're using
[12:29:03] <shoky> so i asked for it
[12:29:09] <shoky> how is that trolling, dumbass
[12:29:10] <xid> ignore the obvious incompleteness of my examples
[12:29:16] <shoky> why ignore
[12:29:21] <shoky> i want to help you, i need info :\
[12:29:40] <xid> dude
[12:29:45] <xid> just look at what thrush said
[12:29:47] <xid> taht's what i'm doing
[12:29:47] <ThrushAAX> so in inspector you don't get an empty object?
[12:29:54] <shoky> xid you didnt say if he's right
[12:29:57] <xid> he is
[12:30:00] <shoky> THANK YOU
[12:30:05] <xid> thrush yes it's empty
[12:30:06] <ThrushAAX> lol
[12:30:12] <ZeroBeholder> Is there a way to see browser events 'like clicking and the target and/or bubbling' as they are happening?
[12:31:21] <shoky> Whirl3d: i think the answer to your question is yes
[12:31:22] <xid> ThrushAAX: it's empty, but it is there, I can see it in the source, and with the pointer inspector
[12:31:30] <ZeroBeholder> I have firebug installed. I have done some break point stuff with positive outcomes, but I just think there has to be a better way.
[12:31:34] <ThrushAAX> xid: my bet is 1) typo 2) some other js is kiling it 3) its not unique
[12:31:42] <ThrushAAX> well, I guess 2 isn't it then
[12:31:51] <shoky> ?demo @ xid
[12:31:56] <xid> it's unique, and it's not a typo
[12:31:57] <shoky> meh
[12:32:31] <ThrushAAX> valid id?
[12:33:07] <xid> <div id="FaqContent">
[12:33:47] <ThrushAAX> hrm, really realy weird then
[12:33:51] <xid> I know
[12:34:52] <shoky> Whirl3d
[12:34:55] <shoky> ?eval function A() {}   A.prototype.arr = []; var a = new A(), b = new A(); a.arr.push('push'); b.arr[0]
[12:35:04] <shoky> both bots dead. damn
[12:35:54] <shoky> xid can you post more of the html/code
[12:35:59] <ThrushAAX> xid: what does $().jquery give you?
[12:36:19] <shoky> better yet a jsfiddle
[12:36:21] <xid> i would post the full URL if it wasn't secured
[12:36:26] <xid> i will post it when i can
[12:36:33] <NoiseEee> xid: are you asking about the element before its in the DOM / in the <head> ?
[12:36:40] <xid> ThrushAAX: TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of null
[12:36:47] <shoky> lol
[12:36:52] <xid> the element is in the body
[12:36:55] <ThrushAAX> xid: jquery isn't being loaded properly
[12:37:03] <ThrushAAX> or some other script is screweing with it
[12:37:09] <ThrushAAX> it should give you the jquery version number
[12:37:11] <xid> jeez... yeah this crappy app includes it
[12:37:14] <xid> along with ext.js
[12:37:19] <shoky> xid: how about jQuery.fn.jquery ?
[12:37:19] <xid> :/
[12:37:46] <xid> jQuery.fn.jquery
[12:37:47] <xid> "1.4.2"
[12:37:49] <shoky> good
[12:37:59] <shoky> just use jQuery instead of $
[12:37:59] <ThrushAAX> yeah use jQuery() instead of $() then
[12:38:03] <xid> ok
[12:38:05] <xid> thanks
[12:38:07] <shoky> or use :
[12:38:14] <xid> :()?
[12:38:23] <shoky> (function($) { ........ your jquery code ... })(jQuery)
[12:38:36] <xid> ok much appreciated
[12:39:15] <xid> yeah that fixes it
[12:39:55] <xid> why does that happen?  some other script is defining $?
[12:40:52] <shoky> most likely
[12:44:39] <shoky> ZeroBeholder: in chrome there's 'event listeners' you can use, but it wont always be easy to figure out what's what
[12:45:48] <shoky> ZeroBeholder: and you might also be interested in: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[12:48:00] <bindi_> hey
[12:48:17] <bindi_> http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/ how can I make the comments appear with an animation after the initial retrieval of comments?
[12:49:28] <shoky> catch (e) { // do nothing. fuck you errors! }
[12:49:30] <shoky> eh :\
[12:49:47] <bindi_> problem? :p
[12:50:02] <shoky> just 'eh' ;>
[12:50:37] <shoky> great function and parameter names.. ;p
[12:50:40] <ZeroBeholder> Thanks shoky.
[12:51:11] <bindi_> shoky: also, how can I call load() outside hat $(document).ready thingy?
[12:51:40] <shoky> bindi_: declare load also outside it
[12:51:43] <bindi_> I tried to add load() to function herp(yo) and it said no such function (cant remember exact error)
[12:52:01] <bindi_> shoky: also? gonna look ugly if I have it twice
[12:52:07] <shoky> no i mean
[12:52:14] <shoky> call it from outside, and also declare it outside
[12:52:20] <shoky> instead of inside
[12:52:36] <bindi_> just declare it outside instead you mean :-D
[12:52:37] <bindi_> sure
[12:52:40] <bindi_> seems simple enough
[12:53:03] <shoky> i meant what i said, yes ;)
[12:55:03] <bindi_> so, what about the tricky animations after initial load?
[12:56:26] <shoky> you can animate anything you want anytime you want ;p
[12:57:36] <shoky> add the new comments with display:none or smth, and then animate them
[12:59:33] <shoky> you could do smth like:  $('<div class="comment hidden" ...>...</div>').appendTo('#comments').show('slow');
[12:59:36] <shoky> (for example)
[13:00:48] <macmartine> How do I trigger an onselect event on a datepicker ( http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#inline ) with jquery?
[13:01:39] <macmartine> I guess in that case I coulde use setDate. I'm in general wondering how to either access the widget itself, or trigger an event that's internal to the widget
[13:02:11] <shoky> why do you want to trigger an onselect event?
[13:02:27] <shoky> (or any other of the widget's events)
[13:03:09] <macmartine> it was just an example, but i realized a bad one. I'm trying to trigger a resize event on https://github.com/themouette/jquery-week-calendar when another part of the page changes
[13:04:28] <bindi_> shoky: I hit a problem.. http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/
[13:04:38] <bindi_> I think
[13:05:30] <shoky> lol
[13:05:31] <pikapp> I am using coin slider to display some images, but I would like to diasble the javascript if there are no images to be displayed, is it best to alter the coin-slider.js file to accomplish this or alter the stylesheet which calls coin-slider?
[13:05:44] <bindi_> shoky: actually no nevermind, someone spammed it :P
[13:06:33] <pikapp> i want to say if (numberOfImagesToBeShown = 0) { do not show the coin-slider }
[13:06:44] <macmartine> shoky: There is 'resizeEvent -  [string,false | default: ‘resize.weekcalendar’] – the event on which to bind calendar resize' -- but i can't figure out how to pass is an ee=xternal event
[13:06:46] <macmartine> *external
[13:09:02] <macmartine> nevermind, got it
[13:09:04] <shoky> macmartine: it doesn't always make sense to "trigger an internal event". the onSelect for example isn't really an 'event' as far as i can tell, it's just a callback
[13:09:20] <shoky> and i have no idea about this week calendar, sry
[13:09:29] <macmartine> i got it
[13:09:36] <macmartine> $("#fullcalendar").trigger('resize.weekcalendar')
[13:09:48] <shoky> cool
[13:11:50] <shoky> pikapp: it's probably better not to alter the plugin's code..
[13:12:15] <shoky> pikapp: it's up to you if you use the plugin's functionality or not
[13:12:31] <shoky> pikapp: or if you show/hide an element
[13:13:49] <ZeroBeholder> I just locked up my cursor. Figured out how to use that event thing, maybe. Restart is needed to be sure.
[13:14:06] <ZeroBeholder> Never did that before, crazy.
[13:14:27] <shoky> the bookmarklet?
[13:15:02] <ZeroBeholder> Yeah, I have a persisting bro-fist from putting it on my toolbar.
[13:15:36] <shoky> not sure what that means but . cool :)
[13:16:15] <jedimind_> .next will only ever return one object, right ?
[13:16:17] <ZeroBeholder> You know when you grab something the cursor turns into a fist, well it refuses to let go.
[13:16:19] <jedimind_> never a collection?
[13:16:27] <ZeroBeholder> Later all.
[13:16:34] <jedimind_> ZeroBeholder, i had that problem once, but then we discussed it and set a safe word
[13:16:52] <jedimind_> so now i say "popsicle" and she lets go
[13:17:34] <shoky> jedimind_ it can return a collection
[13:17:35] <ZeroBeholder> wubblybubbly, WubblyBubbly, WUBBLYBUBBLY, WUUHHHUUBBBLY BUUBBBLLEEEHEEEHEE!!!!!!!
[13:18:04] <shoky> jedimind_:  $('div').next()  would get all elements that are next to all divs
[13:18:06] <jedimind_> shoky, so to make sure i always get just the very next singular item i should eq(0) that badboy?
[13:18:10] <jedimind_> kk
[13:18:25] <ZeroBeholder> Command line restart it is...
[13:18:33] <shoky> well that gets the next element of the first element in your original collection
[13:18:46] <jedimind_> wha
[13:18:47] <jedimind_> wat
[13:18:49] <shoky> they're all the 'very next singular item' :P
[13:19:20] <shoky> $('div').next().eq(0)  is the same as $('div').eq(0).next()  i think
[13:19:32] <jedimind_>  <div /> <p> <ul/> <p> </ul> $('div').next('ul'); will that return both ULs ?
[13:19:37] <jedimind_> err <ul/>
[13:19:51] <jedimind_> no its not, the .eq(0) at the end will return the first matched .next item, not the first div
[13:19:54] <jedimind_> anyway it work
[13:19:54] <jedimind_> s
[13:19:58] <jedimind_> i tyias'd it
[13:20:47] <jedimind_> apologies for the ramble
[13:20:49] * jedimind_ wanders off
[13:21:06] <shoky> ;p
[13:22:39] <shoky> jedimind_, if .next() didn't have a bug that was just fixed a few days ago,  then .next().eq(0)  and .eq(0).next()  would return the same element
[13:23:35] <shoky> (right now .next() bugs out if one of the elements doesnt have a next sibling)
[13:23:54] <shoky> or something
[13:25:40] <Ox41> I'm trying to download thickbox, but the URL is totally broken...
[13:25:49] <shoky> jedimind_ i didnt mean to say that it would return both ULs. because the second UL is not right after a div
[13:25:53] <Ox41> http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
[13:27:00] <fris> dont think that was ever a url for thickbox
[13:27:07] <shoky> it was
[13:27:13] <shoky> but thickbox isn't maintained anymore anyway
[13:27:18] <shoky> http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m1gPtOYfGYAJ:jquery.com/demo/thickbox/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk
[13:27:26] <fris> ahh it is
[13:27:39] <fris> ox41 have a look at the lightbox matrix

[13:32:48] <EyePulp> is there a universal event I can listened for with regards to a returning ajax query?  Not a callback that I specify within individual .ajax() requests, but some sort of handler I can listen with and get the returned data for even ajax request occurring on a page.
[13:33:06] <EyePulp> s/even/every
[13:33:34] <pierpark> can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? $.mobile.changePage("thepage.php", { type: "POST", data: { videoID: $(this).attr('id') } });
[13:33:56] <pierpark> it changes pages, but when I use: <? echo $_POST['videoID']; ?> I get nothing
[13:34:15] <Whirl3d> Eyepulp, .ajaxComplete?
[13:34:15] <bot-t> (20 hours 10 mins ago) <shoky> tell Whirl3d i didn't really get what he was referencing (apeshit) ;P
[13:34:19] <EyePulp> http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[13:34:20] <NoiseEee> pierpark: what do you think "this" is?
[13:34:38] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: yeah, something along those lines.  that might be it
[13:34:49] <pierpark> NoiseEee: that is inside of: $("img").click(function( ....
[13:35:26] <pierpark> NoiseEee: when the image is clicked, I have an alert for testing that $(this) and it works fine. I also tried videoID: "test"
[13:38:53] <NoiseEee> pierpark: and alert/console.log ($(this).attr('id'); ?
[13:39:12] <Whirl3d> .add adds a jquery object to the end of another jquery object, correct?
[13:39:38] <Francis47> can someone tell me why this script miscalculates in chrome but not in Firefox?: http://pastebin.com/LcnUe96e
[13:39:47] <Whirl3d> does that affect the object's index? or does index only refer to the dom order..
[13:39:48] <pierpark> I'm on windows on hostgator. let me go see if I can SSH into there and look for that. never knew about it
[13:40:28] <pierpark> um... but its javascript so i'd imagine it'd be local somewhere
[13:41:06] <pierpark> NoiseEee: maybe I can check it out from this linux laptop..one sec
[13:41:14] <NoiseEee> pierpark: console.log has nothing to do with linux console, its your debugger
[13:41:35] <NoiseEee> pierpark: just log/alert what you're sending to your server
[13:42:09] <pierpark> NoiseEee: okay i'll go check it out.
[13:43:50] <shoky> Whirl3d: it depends how you call .index
[13:44:54] <shoky> Whirl3d if you just use .index() with no params then there wont be any effect by .add
[13:45:25] <code_ph0y> hey guys can someone tell me how you run over elements with a class ... for example in mootools it would be ... $$('.class').each(function(item) {alert(item);});
[13:45:40] <Whirl3d> hey shoky!   well then when would it?
[13:45:58] <NoiseEee> code_ph0y: $('.className');  // [el1, el2, el3]
[13:46:00] <shoky> heyss. wat?
[13:46:05] <shoky> oh
[13:47:17] <shoky> Whirl3d it would matter if you did:   myJqCollection.index(someElement)  vs   myJqCollection.add(elementToAdd).index(someElement)
[13:47:25] <code_ph0y> NoiseEee: ok so is it like $('.className').each(function() {});
[13:47:27] <code_ph0y> ?
[13:47:42] <NoiseEee> code_ph0y: if you were going to each them,  $('.className').each(function(i,el)) { });
[13:47:51] <Whirl3d> cool. I never though about using index like that. That works out great...
[13:48:08] <NoiseEee> code_ph0y: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[13:48:17] <code_ph0y> nice bud and i is what itteration
[13:48:23] <code_ph0y> <3 thanks bud
[14:02:31] <jedimind_> can anyone spot any obvious errors here: http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/97WqX/
[14:02:45] <jedimind_> basically the form is being submitted via $post but it doesnt seem to be working at all
[14:05:54] <bartmax> jedimind_: you sure this is the form in the submit event ?
[14:06:27] <jedimind_> eh
[14:06:33] <jedimind_> its the only form in the dom
[14:06:45] <jedimind_> the function runs, the validation works
[14:06:50] <jedimind_> its the $.post that seems to be having issues
[14:07:39] <bartmax> you are passing json as a 3rd parameter
[14:10:09] <bartmax> jedimind_: the fiddle works flawlessly
[14:10:21] <bartmax> jedimind_: everything is in place and the function the request is made correct.
[14:10:55] <bartmax> jedimind_: check in network result on the developement inspector (chrome) or firebug and check what error the server is returning. the php is the problem, not the form post
[14:11:20] <jedimind_> bartmax, i was expecting the ELSE case of the $.post to trigger
[14:11:24] <jedimind_> in the event that there was no response
[14:11:56] <jedimind_> but just got told that the response is a fail state anyway, so the if/else never even gets triggered
[14:12:03] <bartmax> jedimind_: the function it's the success one
[14:12:07] <jedimind_> anyway its all good, im going to swap it with $.ajax
[14:12:17] <jedimind_> yeah
[14:12:26] <bartmax> jedimind_: $.post is a shorthand that ONLY includes the success function, not the errorfunction.
[14:12:53] <bartmax> jedimind_: jQuery.post( url [, data] [, success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)] [, dataType] )
[14:13:00] <bartmax> jedimind_: so it's only called onSuccess :D
[14:13:03] <jedimind_> eah
[14:13:05] <jedimind_> yeah*
[14:13:09] <jedimind_> that was my problem
[14:13:11] <jedimind_> its all good
[14:13:13] <bartmax> use $.ajax
[14:13:19] <jedimind_> <jedimind_> anyway its all good, im going to swap it with $.ajax
[14:13:20] <jedimind_> :)
[14:14:14] <serdem>  hey guys. i have this string  ->    some text here <input type="hidden" value="hiddenvalue1" name="Hidden1" />
[14:14:32] <serdem> my question is how can i get Hidden1's value in that string?
[14:14:52] <serdem> i mean "hiddenvalue1".
[14:14:56] <serdem> in this case.
[14:14:57] <bartmax> serdem: $('input[name="Hidden1"]').val()
[14:15:11] <NoiseEee> serdem: if its really a string, regex
[14:16:08] <serdem> my ajax function return this whole string as data -> success: function(data)
[14:16:22] <shoky> or $(str).find('input[name="Hidden1"]').val()
[14:17:06] <bartmax> serdem: as shoky saids.
[14:17:19] <serdem> i'm trying guys. thanks
[14:19:23] <LoneStar99> asked this yesterday, i have a scroller behavior, how do i get rid of behavior when not on scroller/
[14:19:23] <LoneStar99> ?
[14:19:50] <serdem> shoky, that didn't work so i tried like this : alert( $(data).find("#Hidden1").val());
[14:20:03] <serdem> and that returns undefined.
[14:20:05] <shoky> serdem that looks for an id="Hidden1"
[14:20:10] <bartmax> serdem: you dont have a id="Hidden1"
[14:20:34] <serdem> oh :S
[14:20:44] <SmokingSlim> hi guys, I have a quick question about a scrolling effect, if it's possible to do it with jQuery
[14:20:48] <Whirl3d> I think I finally get it. I create a "plugin" that creates a controller object for my sections and then either builds or loads it's contents using another class stucture. I think it's finally starting to make sense...sheesh
[14:21:15] <thinkt4nk> SmokingSlim animate({ scrollTop: elements_scroll_height })
[14:21:28] <SmokingSlim> thinkt4nk
[14:21:32] <SmokingSlim> hah maybe :)
[14:21:40] <SmokingSlim> http://selected.com/en/#/collection/homme/
[14:22:04] <SmokingSlim> the effect on that page, the way they overlap when you scroll
[14:22:25] <thinkt4nk> SmokingSlim that's all flash
[14:22:27] <SmokingSlim> I know how to zoom them and all but... they way the elements move
[14:22:46] <SmokingSlim> ya i know it's flash but it can be done w/ jQuery?
[14:23:30] <Whirl3d> yes
[14:23:34] <SmokingSlim> i'm thinking something like Isotope / mansonry plugin for the layout of the elements and then add some scrolling to that
[14:23:35] <thinkt4nk> yeah
[14:23:44] <thinkt4nk> there's nothing really special going on there
[14:23:52] <Whirl3d> it's roughly referred to as parrallax scrolling
[14:24:11] <serdem> shoky, i changed it to <input type="hidden" value="hiddenvalue1" id="Hidden1" name="Hidden1" />
[14:24:19] <Whirl3d> all they did was use a different animation rate for the "front" blox
[14:24:37] <Whirl3d> so they all end up in the same place, just the "front" blox take a second longer
[14:24:44] <serdem> and use like success: function(data)
[14:24:44] <SmokingSlim> ya i know about parallax and jarallax, think it could be done like that? to iniate a parallax movement when scrolling and then just align when scroll is out
[14:24:44] <serdem> {
[14:24:44] <serdem> alert( $(data).find("#Hidden1").val()); ...
[14:24:50] <Whirl3d> *second is more like half a second.
[14:24:57] <jfisk87> hey guys
[14:25:10] <serdem> sorry about flooding. still get undefined..
[14:25:16] * Caine escapes from the angsty anti-jquery folks on #javascript. :)
[14:25:23] <Whirl3d> SmokingSlim, no need to align except the first time
[14:25:28] <thinkt4nk> lol @ Caine
[14:25:29] <jfisk87> im trying to append a new div, with a div element inside it like so: 	           		me.$node('rows').append('<div class="row">'+avatarContent + '</div>');
[14:25:31] <LoneStar99> a link to my issue...  http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/Dn8gL/ "want box-shadow" to disappear when not on scroller
[14:25:46] <jfisk87> but instead of seeing my content appended im just seeing [object HTMLDivElement]
[14:26:09] <jfisk87> how could i append the contents of that to that new div
[14:26:11] <Whirl3d> once you have them lined up the way you want, apply the scroll handler, fgure out how much to scroll each item and scroll each item that much.
[14:26:23] <shoky> serdem what exactly does the 'data' string look like
[14:26:24] <Whirl3d> just make sure the "front" labeled items take a half second more
[14:27:01] <SmokingSlim> Whirl3d thanks! I'll give it a shot tomorrow, i need to read up on the parallaxing thing
[14:27:23] <Whirl3d> seriously, dont' read up on it. This is simulating the parallax thing.
[14:27:44] <Whirl3d> It'll just get confusing.
[14:27:54] <serdem> shoky,  here is the sample code http://jsfiddle.net/Tzv4y/1/
[14:27:54] <Whirl3d> Just try it without the scroll.
[14:28:01] <shoky> jfisk87: what is avatarContent?
[14:28:30] <jfisk87> shoky: its a div with content from a method call
[14:28:49] <Caine> jquery newbie here...I literally learned about it 30 minutes ago on #javascript from ljharb. :)  basically, I'm trying to extract the following bits from this "some id" div: http://pastebin.com/GhDBwpBt  Basically the dataCol sections of that html.  Assuming I have the id of the "some id" div...how do I drill down to get the data?
[14:29:00] <Whirl3d> take ten blocks in a checkerboard and animate them all up 200px.  then in the animation call, put half of them at 500 duration and half of them at 700 duration and they'll do the same. Plus, use easeOutBack...it'll be the best for that effect
[14:29:35] <SmokingSlim> Whirl3d ait ait, i'll check it out tomorrow :) thanks for the information dude!
[14:29:46] <Whirl3d> np
[14:31:07] <shoky> jfisk87:  $('<div class="row"></div>').append(avatarContent).appendTo( me.$node('rows') )
[14:31:07] <serdem> <bartmax> here is the sample code http://jsfiddle.net/Tzv4y/1/    would you check it please?
[14:31:27] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d: you are like an expert, what is your take on what i am trying to do --> http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/Dn8gL/1/
[14:32:34] <Whirl3d> lol don't ever say that.
[14:32:35] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:32:53] <shoky> serdem i see
[14:33:09] <Whirl3d> fiddle is running so slowly today...I'm looking LoneStar99
[14:33:10] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d: well you know more that most when it comes to jquery
[14:33:49] <Whirl3d> LoneStar99, you are gonna have to use CSS to do that.
[14:33:49] <shoky> serdem:  try  $('<div/>').append( data ).find('#Hidden1')
[14:34:07] <jfisk87> thank you shoky!
[14:34:18] <Whirl3d> I'll show ya, gimme just a second
[14:35:21] <serdem> shoky, that worked!. would you explain please? thank you very much btw!
[14:35:47] <shoky> serdem: np. it's cause .find only looks for descendants of the root element
[14:35:48] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d:  CSS to fadeOut or box-shadow?
[14:36:08] <shoky> serdem: so that wouldn't help if the root element is the <input>
[14:36:35] <gaspyr> webkit-box-shadow: 2px 5px 0 0 rgba(72,72,72,1);
[14:36:36] <gaspyr>      -moz-box-shadow: 2px 5px 0 0 rgba(72,72,72,1);
[14:36:36] <gaspyr>       box-shadow: 2px72 5px 0 0 rgba(72,72,72,1);
[14:37:01] <gaspyr> play with the values as u wish
[14:37:05] <shoky> Whirl3d you are like an expert!
[14:37:39] <gaspyr> hello expert shoky :D
[14:37:56] <Whirl3d> lol like an expert without all that extra expert nonsense, maybe.
[14:37:58] <LoneStar99> gaspyr: ok thanks, but trying to fadeOut box-shadow when user is not on scroll..
[14:38:49] <bartmax> serdem: var $div = $('<div></div>')
[14:38:49] <bartmax>     $div.html('some text <input type="hidden" value="hiddenvalue1" id="Hidden1" name="Hidden1" />');
[14:38:49] <bartmax> console.log($div.find('#Hidden1').val());
[14:38:57] <gaspyr> try a lose focus event ?
[14:39:23] <shoky> hi gaspyr
[14:39:50] <LoneStar99> gaspyr a lose focus event when not using scroller/
[14:39:51] <LoneStar99> ?
[14:40:08] <bartmax> serdem: nevermind, didn't see shoky answered it already way more pretty coded :D
[14:40:24] <code_ph0y> hey guys whats the matter with this: $('.search_filter').each(function(i, el) {el.click(function() {});});
[14:40:28] <gaspyr> i dunno what ur thinking of, well when i read tht line i thought u wanted to fadeout the scroller, when the user stop cliking it
[14:40:36] <code_ph0y> it keeps reloading the page :S
[14:40:46] <gaspyr> didnt know u were talking about the scroll button case :)
[14:40:55] <bartmax> code_ph0y: you should use this not el i think
[14:41:04] <serdem> <bartmax>, it made me understand more... thanks a lot!!
[14:41:11] <serdem> :))
[14:41:17] <code_ph0y> ok let me try
[14:41:42] <_Z3R0> ok all you jquery people I have a question... I'm using .hide() .remove() anything I can find to not display an element, but when I trigger the parent to get the children, the element still "exists" even though it's not there... any way to do this ?
[14:41:58] <code_ph0y> still getting it
[14:42:08] <LoneStar99> gaspyr: here is my code -->
[14:42:20] <code_ph0y> $('.search_filter').each(function(i, el) {this.click(function() {});});
[14:42:30] <LoneStar99> gaspyr: http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/Dn8gL/1/
[14:42:49] <bartmax> code_ph0y: $('.search_filter').each(function(i) {
[14:42:50] <bartmax>     $(this).click(function() {});
[14:42:50] <bartmax> });​
[14:43:41] <code_ph0y> wow wait bartmax
[14:43:46] <code_ph0y> i think am using this wrong
[14:43:59] <code_ph0y> i'll try that first
[14:44:16] <gaspyr> trying to read it :)
[14:45:09] <Whirl3d> isn't mouseup a valid event?
[14:45:36] <bartmax> Whirl3d: yes...i recommend release tho.
[14:46:26] <Whirl3d> interesting that it doesn't fire when the scrollbar is released.
[14:48:17] <Whirl3d> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5972542/how-to-detect-mouseup-on-a-scrollbar-or-scrollend-event
[14:48:23] <bartmax> Whirl3d: interesting, maybe scroll stop
[14:49:31] <_Z3R0> nvm I lied, used remove() in one place, forgot to change hide() -> remove() in another haha ;)
[14:50:03] <bartmax> Whirl3d: interesting ...
[14:50:11] <bartmax> _Z3R0: we know
[14:50:26] <shoky> we will never trust you again
[14:51:04] <gaspyr> haha
[14:57:27] <Whirl3d> what element scrolls?
[14:57:51] <Whirl3d> Which element do I check "scrollTop()" on
[14:59:01] <[fields]> Whirl3d:  document?
[15:02:10] <Validatorian> Question: I've got a lot of elements that are like this: <input id="foo" class="hideObj" /> - I'd like to be able to just use $('#foo').fadeIn() to show it, but the hideObj class is still set, and it has display: none!important; so it needs to be removed. Is there any way to extend all of jQuery's 'show' functions (slideIn, fadeIn, show, perhaps more) to remove the class if it exists?
[15:02:40] <Validatorian> (without having to do $('#foo').hide().removeClass('hideObj').show())
[15:03:01] <bartmax> Validatorian: first: don't use ID, just class.
[15:03:28] <bartmax> Validatorian: display:none !important (on a style sheet) isn't weighther than display:none inline style. it should work anyways.
[15:03:32] <bartmax> of the important clause
[15:03:37] <Validatorian> hmm -- aren't ID's faster, due to getElementByID?
[15:03:54] <bartmax> " I've got a lot of elements " .... id are meant to be unique
[15:04:10] <Validatorian> yes, they have unique IDs -- that's just an example
[15:04:11] <bartmax> it's fast, but don't returns all elements, just the first in most case scenario
[15:04:22] <bartmax> Validatorian: ok. than it's ok to use ID.
[15:05:08] <bartmax> <style> .hideObj {display:none !important }</style> <div style="display:block"></div> <-- div is visible.
[15:06:52] <Validatorian> bartmax: http://jsfiddle.net/q6HgD/
[15:07:53] <bartmax> Validatorian: that code works perfectlly
[15:07:58] <bartmax> Validatorian: that's the way to do it
[15:08:05] <Validatorian> ... It doesn't show the first one
[15:08:10] <Validatorian> what browser are you using?
[15:08:12] <bartmax> Validatorian: it's ok.
[15:08:16] <bartmax> Validatorian: not show is ok
[15:08:29] <bartmax> if you want to override the important you MUST include an inline style.
[15:09:13] <Validatorian> Yea, I'm not trying to override it though, I just want to remove the class
[15:09:48] <bartmax> Validatorian: then remove the class instead of using show.
[15:09:58] <bartmax> Validatorian: dont use show, jsut remove class
[15:10:09] <Validatorian> Heh, sorry, I should have been more clear
[15:10:16] <Validatorian> what would you suggest for fadeIn() for examplke
[15:10:21] <Validatorian> show() was a bad example
[15:10:36] <bartmax> Validatorian: include an inline style
[15:10:48] <Validatorian> that's not an option, can't modify the existing html
[15:11:19] <bartmax> remove the !important from the class ?
[15:11:26] <Validatorian> not an option :-/
[15:11:41] <Caine> interesting problem.  I'm trying to get some data from a pop-up that only exists during a mouseover event.   My idea is that I should be able to get the data from the pop-up, once the mouseover is triggered (as then it will become part of the page)....but my datas[] return "undefined".  http://pastebin.com/Trd2Z45f      This is the data format: http://pastebin.com/GhDBwpBt   Anyone have any ideas?
[15:11:45] <bartmax> then, use js include an inline
[15:12:10] <bartmax> $('.showMe').css({'display' : 'none'}); something like that.
[15:13:21] <bartmax> dont remember the css property syntax
[15:13:28] <Validatorian> I'm more looking for a generic solution, something like $.fn.fadeIn = function () { $(this).removeClass('hideObj') } -- but I'm wondering if jQuery uses something generic, so it will work for all 'showers' like slideIn
[15:14:25] <bartmax> Validatorian: you can extend the show, fadein, etc...
[15:14:25] <bartmax> Validatorian: you can extend the show, fadein, etc...
[15:14:25] <bartmax> Validatorian: you can extend the show, fadein, etc...
[15:14:27] <bartmax> Validatorian: you can extend the show, fadein, etc...
[15:14:31] <bartmax> sorry for the dupes
[15:14:37] <bartmax> stupid irclient
[15:14:46] <Whirl3d> LoneStar99, here's a hack you could try:
[15:14:59] <Validatorian> Yes, but can I extend them all with one extend, rather than extending each shower individually?
[15:15:58] <shoky> Caine: you're triggering the mouseover event so that the popup shows and you can access its elements?
[15:16:00] <Whirl3d> on scroll, add the shadowed class to your div...that will animate in the sahdow....then setup a "plain" class that animates out the shadow in .5s   so add the class (effect happens), then remove the class and add the plain class immediately.
[15:16:27] <Caine> shoky, yes
[15:17:00] <shoky> Caine: the code right after your dispatchEvent line gets executed right then, maybe before the popup is shown, no?
[15:17:26] <bartmax> Validatorian: you should check the jquery code to see how does those function works. If uses css fn behind you can extend fn.css but i can't be sure. shoky maybe knows or ajpiano
[15:17:45] <bartmax> Validatorian: or you can check the source code of jquery of course. It's quite understandable and documented.
[15:18:22] <Caine> shoky, hmm...I wonder.  Is there a good way to wait for it to show before running?
[15:18:45] <shoky> Caine: i don't really know what you're doing when handling the mouseover event.. so no idea :P
[15:20:13] <bartmax> Validatorian: probabily all animations use animate function behind, so you can only extend that one.
[15:20:19] <Caine> shoky, well, what if I used jquery to search for the element and see if it's there first...
[15:20:30] <Caine> how would I test for 'a[id^="lookup"][id$="Page_form_j_id64cas3Hover"]'
[15:20:32] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile SF keynote presentation by @toddmparker: https://t.co/sEkrXAN4 ★ http://bit.ly/LxufUA
[15:20:41] <Whirl3d> LoneStar99, here it is in all it's glory....ugly but kind of working: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Dn8gL/36/
[15:20:43] <shoky> Caine: you're already doing that
[15:21:22] <Caine> shoky, well, I'm just running a jquery on that element, but I'm not testing to see if it's there
[15:21:47] <Caine> I wonder if I would get an error if there was no such element?
[15:21:47] <shoky> Caine: running $(selector) looks for stuff in the DOM
[15:22:08] <Caine> shoky, right...but is there an error if it isn't found?
[15:22:08] <SmokingSlim> Whirl3d do you have any tips from the top of your mind on how I should simulate that parallax effect we talked about earlier? should I write it from the bottom up or does it exsist any boilerplate for parallaxing?
[15:22:12] <shoky> not an error, but  $(selector).length would be 0
[15:22:28] <Validatorian> shoky, Whirl3d, ajpiano, any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/9ZuTB/ -- I need to extend the 'shower' in jquery to add style="display: none" and remove the "hide" class, then proceed, but I'd rather not extend each individually -- any ideas?
[15:22:32] <Caine> ah, so hmm...that seems testable
[15:22:41] <Whirl3d> LoneStar99, you owe me big time: this one is perfect...hacky but perfect: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Dn8gL/37/
[15:22:54] <shoky> Caine it won't help you though (unless you run the test repeatedly on an interval...)
[15:23:15] <Whirl3d> SmokingSlim, I'm about half done with a simple fiddle to show you
[15:23:30] <shoky> Caine: you need to wait until the elements are there in the popup. what is the mechanism putting the elements there?
[15:23:42] <SmokingSlim> Whirl3d lol, are you a cyborg?
[15:23:44] <Caine> shoky, not sure what you mean
[15:23:59] <shoky> Caine: what is being done in response to the mouseover event?
[15:24:30] <Caine> some sort of ajax thing
[15:24:44] <shoky> why are you triggering the mouseover event anyway
[15:25:03] <shoky> why not call whatever code is registered to handle the mouseover event?
[15:25:54] <shoky> and if it's an ajax thing, you have the ajax success callback, which adds your elements to the popup. you can put your code in there..
[15:36:33] <Whirl3d> SmokingSlim, here is a rough example. You can take it from here. Notice they overlap slightly.http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BxtZw/7/
[15:39:03] <SmokingSlim> Whirl3d alright :) Thanks, I'll do the best I can with the code!
[15:41:05] <shoky> Validatorian: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/9ZuTB/1/  :\
[15:42:15] <Whirl3d> SmokingSlim,  by putting the margin-left attributes in "+=100" it says "move over this much") which you can see on the second click. If you dont have the margin left defined, it just puts it at 100...And you'll want to bind it to the scroll event to check how much to scroll.
[15:43:32] <SmokingSlim> Whirl3d excellent!
[15:44:40] <Whirl3d> Remind me to smack the shit out of LoneStar99 next time I see him. LOL
[15:44:59] <Whirl3d> 8)
[15:47:48] <Whirl3d> SmokingSlim, don't forget to include the easing plugin when you try it on your own...
[15:48:09] <iateadonut> i have a variable 'client' that contains an integer.
[15:48:23] <MistuhKurtz> I'm looking at JS files for twitter bootstrap... what is the purpose of the ! in front of functions, like this: !function ($) { ... }(window.jQuery);
[15:48:45] <Whirl3d> negates the result
[15:48:52] <iateadonut> and i want to eliminate all <tr>'s that don't contain the attribute data-userid=337 (where var client = 337)
[15:48:53] <MistuhKurtz> I know that it creates a self-executing function with a negated return value
[15:49:16] <SmokingSlim> Whirl3d alright! thanks a million again! :)
[15:49:17] <iateadonut> how do i do that?  something like:  $('tr').not(...).hide();
[15:49:22] <shoky> nah it's not negation there
[15:49:31] <Whirl3d> Really?
[15:49:36] <MistuhKurtz> yeah it does shoky
[15:49:39] <MistuhKurtz> try running this
[15:49:44] <shoky> wat
[15:49:54] <shoky> i mean , even if it does some negation,
[15:49:57] <shoky> that's not the purpose
[15:50:00] <MistuhKurtz> !function(){ return true; }();
[15:50:04] <Whirl3d> it's used like an ifthen
[15:50:09] <shoky> no
[15:50:12] <MistuhKurtz> it will return false
[15:50:22] <shoky> it's just to symbolize that it's an IIFE
[15:50:28] <shoky> or someth
[15:50:34] <MistuhKurtz> IIFE?
[15:50:42] <Whirl3d> sounds suspect....lol
[15:50:55] <shoky> immediately invoked function expression
[15:51:05] <shoky> the right name for what you called "self executing" function
[15:51:16] <MistuhKurtz> right
[15:51:22] <Whirl3d> (and a pet peeve of shoky's, btw)
[15:51:28] <MistuhKurtz> haha
[15:51:49] <MistuhKurtz> it's the same as (function(){ .... })();
[15:51:55] <MistuhKurtz> right?
[15:52:04] <MistuhKurtz> but it negates the return
[15:52:09] <MistuhKurtz> inverts
[15:52:12] <Whirl3d> maybe not...
[15:52:13] <shoky> ah
[15:52:28] <shoky> this has a good discussion: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7586870/in-javascript-what-is-the-advantage-of-function-over-function
[15:52:44] <MistuhKurtz> try running this:
[15:52:45] <MistuhKurtz> var test = !function(){ return false }();
[15:52:45] <MistuhKurtz> console.log(test);
[15:52:56] <MistuhKurtz> the console will log "true"
[15:52:57] <shoky> it's instead of doing:   (function(){ ... })()
[15:53:09] <shoky> you do:  !function(){}()
[15:53:09] <MistuhKurtz> Is there any disadvantage to doing it that way shoky ?
[15:53:16] <shoky> nah
[15:53:21] <shoky> dont think so, at least
[15:53:27] <MistuhKurtz> to me the ! makes it unclear, and I don't like that it inverts the return
[15:53:47] <shoky> well yeah you shouldn't use it when you're counting on the return value
[15:53:52] <MistuhKurtz> although you can use a double !!function() to keep the return value the same
[15:54:24] <MistuhKurtz> So twitter bootstrap just uses it for variable scoping purposes
[15:54:56] <Whirl3d> MistuhKurtz you read fast!
[15:55:12] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[15:55:17] <shoky> everybody uses IIFE's for variable scoping
[15:55:34] <shoky> i use it for other stuff around the home, too
[15:55:40] <someprimetime> can i have $.each() return an array to another $.each()?
[15:55:48] <Whirl3d> That's how you keep your hair so shiny!
[15:55:53] <shoky> someprimetime: maybe you want $.map
[15:56:19] <someprimetime> shoky: sick thanks
[15:56:29] <shoky> to the bone
[15:56:34] <MistuhKurtz> It's just confusing because using the parenthesis makes it clear that it's JUST for IIFE purposes, whereas the ! you don't know if they're trying to modify the return value as well
[15:56:59] <shoky> MistuhKurtz, agreed
[15:57:27] * MistuhKurtz files this under solved mysteries
[15:57:30] <MistuhKurtz> :D
[15:58:10] <shoky> OK. going to visit a friend up north. Whirl3d you're in charge, and also you're like an expert
[15:58:14] <shoky> buhbye
[15:58:46] <Whirl3d> see ya
[15:58:50] <Whirl3d> thanks for your help all day
[15:58:55] <Whirl3d> every day
[16:01:48] <[fields]> I need some help
[16:02:54] <[fields]> I'm working on a jquerymobile phonegap app... this one page in my application, which has a form (which renders fine using jqm techniques) seems to not know jquery even though the .min.js is included
[16:03:37] <[fields]> <script>$(document).ready(function() { alert('test'); } </script>     does nothing
[16:03:57] <Whirl3d> [fields], did you initialize jquery with noConflict?
[16:04:04] <[fields]> i do not know of noConflict
[16:04:15] <Whirl3d> ? noConflict?
[16:04:16] <bot-t> Whirl3d, jQuery.noConflict() - Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[16:04:49] <Whirl3d> perhaps another library has usurped your use of the $ variable.  Try jQuery(document).ready(....
[16:04:59] <[fields]> hmm...
[16:05:16] <[fields]> testing, brb...
[16:06:02] <Whirl3d> This can also be solved by wrapping all of your jquery code in a IIFE like (function ($) {  do stuff where I need $=jquery}(jQuery);
[16:07:45] <[fields]> $.noConflict(); $(document).ready(function() { alert('ready ready'); });     has had no effect
[16:08:37] <Whirl3d> try just     jQuery(document.read(....
[16:09:11] <Whirl3d> because if something has taken the $ variable, you might not be able to run $.noConflict()....
[16:10:35] <[fields]> still no alert
[16:10:47] <[fields]> using only:  jQuery(document.ready(function() { alert('ready ready'); });
[16:10:51] <Whirl3d> then in fact, jquery is not loading
[16:10:59] <Whirl3d> noo
[16:11:12] <[fields]> am I missing a )
[16:11:15] <Whirl3d> jQuery(document).ready(function (){
[16:11:18] <[fields]> k
[16:11:29] <Whirl3d> jQuery usually == $
[16:11:34] <[fields]> ahh
[16:11:47] <Whirl3d> but some libraries take it over so maybe phonegap===$
[16:12:17] <[fields]> I haven't had this issue on previous pages of my application though
[16:12:22] <[fields]> I'm still having the same issue, no alert
[16:12:22] <Whirl3d> and jQuery is out in the cold. But jQuery(document).ready(function () {console.log("hello")}) should work...
[16:12:30] <Whirl3d> then jquery's not loading
[16:12:44] <[fields]> let me pastebin my html
[16:13:02] <Whirl3d> use jsfiddle, please. It's slow today, but so much better
[16:13:08] <[fields]> ok
[16:13:12] <Whirl3d> thanks
[16:15:42] <[fields]> wouldn't jquerymobile not work at all (i.e.- data-role="button" )  if jquery didn't work first
[16:15:44] <[fields]> ?
[16:16:17] <someprimetime> how can I find an html element where the attr('src') == (source of my img)?
[16:17:00] <[fields]> someprimetime:  you'll need .each() to iterate through all elements
[16:17:18] <someprimetime> [fields]: word thanks
[16:17:35] <Whirl3d> $("img[src="+mysource+"]")
[16:18:00] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, don't use .each
[16:18:06] <[fields]> well that looks a hell of a lot more efficient
[16:18:06] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: thanks even better
[16:18:14] <Whirl3d> you could use filter also
[16:18:24] <[fields]> don't you think behind the scenes it is using .each() ?
[16:18:50] <Whirl3d> Not sure. I think each is a front fron the pushStack method
[16:19:24] <[fields]> ok, here's my HTML.  My includes are in the head tags at top
[16:19:26] <[fields]> http://jsfiddle.net/v83Xe/1/
[16:20:02] <[fields]> but I swear the includes are identical to what I use on other pages, where jQuery does seem to be loading and behaving fine
[16:21:48] <Whirl3d> try removing cordova and common and see if it works. Try removing jqmobile too. just to see if there's a conflict somehow
[16:22:16] <Whirl3d> in consolde can you access anything? like $("body").css("backgroundColor","red");
[16:22:33] <[fields]> I'm in XCode and am not sure how to find the console
[16:22:55] <Whirl3d> lol. I don't even know what XCode is
[16:23:06] <[fields]> the compiler for Mac
[16:23:35] <[fields]> gotta have it to make iDevice applications
[16:24:25] <[fields]> Phonegap(Apache Cordova) seemed to be a great way to use HTML5/CSS/JavaScript and compile to Android or iOS or more.  But I'm doing it all from a Mac workstation
[16:24:58] <[fields]> Doing what I'm doing in Eclipse (for Android), I know how to find the console
[16:25:48] <someprimetime> @Whirl3d that's dope
[16:25:49] <someprimetime> thanks
[16:25:51] <[fields]> and jquerymobile made it even that much better to rapidly develop, having fresh design theme quickly
[16:29:42] <Dash_Merc> I have searched Google for assistance, and I have been debugging for hours and cannot get this to work. Is anyone willing to help me with a nested .each() issue?
[16:31:29] <Dash_Merc> Basically, I've got a very large and complex html form, defining a project. Each project also has events. Each event has other attributes, and a few of those attributes have further-nested attributes.
[16:31:47] <code_ph0y> A form was submitted in the windows-1252 encoding which cannot encode all Unicode characters, so user input may get corrupted. To avoid this problem, the page should be changed so that the form is submitted in the UTF-8 encoding either by changing the encoding of the page itself to UTF-8 or by specifying accept-charset=utf-8 on the form element.
[16:31:58] <code_ph0y> i keep running into this problem
[16:32:23] <Dash_Merc> I'm trying to scrape all the form inputs and convert them into a JS object, to then JSON.stringify()
[16:32:53] <code_ph0y> $('form').serialize()
[16:33:12] <code_ph0y> just use the url
[16:33:33] <Dash_Merc> When I target the child form, and inspect the results, I see all the child elements, but when I .each() and try to target the children elements directly,I get nothing
[16:34:04] <Dash_Merc> code_ph0y: I can just serialize the whole parent container and it will scrape the values fro meach of the inputs automatically?
[16:36:57] <Dash_Merc> well, serializing the entire form is interesting, but it's not JSON, unfortunately.
[16:37:16] <Dash_Merc> The output absolutely *must* be in JSON
[16:37:46] <Dash_Merc> Because that's what the back-end is expecting, and we don't have time to configure it for anything else
[16:38:23] <Dash_Merc> code_ph0y: as for your issue...I would just apply a meta tag for the encoding and set it to utf-8
[16:39:02] <Dash_Merc> code_ph0y: like so: <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
[16:42:41] <Validatorian> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/9ZuTB/2/ -- try the toggles -- is there a more efficient way than adding .not(':visible') to the 'this'?
[16:43:56] <Whirl3d> Validatorian, he's gone up north for the evening. Sorry
[16:44:11] <Validatorian> dang. Any suggestions, Whirl3d?
[16:45:06] <Whirl3d> I wish I knew where this programming style comes from because it is so weird to me.
[16:45:16] <Validatorian> shoky wrote it :-P
[16:45:27] <Whirl3d> it's java...lol
[16:45:41] <Dash_Merc> code_ph0y: I was using $("table.class").each(function(){$(this).children("input.class").each(function(){$(this).val() but it didn't work. I replaced the children with .find() and it magically worked. Why wouldn't children work?
[16:45:42] <Validatorian> oh, you're not talking about my stuff ;)
[16:45:53] <Whirl3d> what are you trying to do?
[16:46:25] <Validatorian> it's alright, .not(':visible') works.. It should only be called when needed, so it's not a big performance issue, I don't think
[16:46:47] <Whirl3d> I don't even see that in your fiddle.
[16:47:03] <Validatorian> it's not -- I was showing the issue (click the buttons)
[16:47:21] <Whirl3d> try $(":hidden")
[16:51:48] <jedimind> ladies and gents, i present to you: http://jqueryto.com/
[16:51:52] <jedimind> official announcement tomorrow
[16:53:09] <coldhead> handsome site, jedimind
[16:53:28] * jedimind blushes
[16:53:35] <jedimind> zach designed it, i made it work
[16:54:27] <Whirl3d> it doesn't scroll backwards...
[16:54:35] <Whirl3d> and is it touch enabled?
[16:54:46] <jedimind> lol
[16:54:48] <Whirl3d> Looks great though
[16:54:58] <Whirl3d> just can't go back to see the previous pane
[16:55:53] <Whirl3d> and the back button breaks when you click subcontent (like one of the people's profiles)
[16:56:07] <jedimind> are we talking about the same thing?
[16:56:19] <jedimind> there are no people's profiles?
[16:56:23] <Whirl3d> I'm looking at your site
[16:56:44] <Whirl3d> err I assumed it was  yours...bnotions?
[16:56:50] <Whirl3d> the top link on the page.
[16:56:52] <jedimind> ohhh bnotions.com not jqueryto
[16:57:04] <jedimind> yeah, bnotions is getting a revamp soon, that site was slapped together before my time there
[16:57:39] <jedimind> there are quite few flaws with its current itteration
[16:57:52] <Dash_Merc> welp. thanks guise. figgerd it out. later.
[16:57:52] <Whirl3d> it sill looks nice...
[16:58:15] <Whirl3d> Dash_Merc, what was the issue?
[16:58:18] <jedimind> Whirl3d, yeah visually its not bad, just a bit of a mess from a UX perspective
[16:59:22] <iateadonut> jedimind, yes, very nice looking
[16:59:52] <Whirl3d> uggghh uses .live---shame! jk
[17:03:21] <qntb> hey
[17:03:28] <qntb> anyone here?
[17:03:48] <Whirl3d> maybe? What it to ya?
[17:03:55] <qntb> need a bit of help
[17:04:06] <Whirl3d> ?ask
[17:04:06] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:04:25] <qntb> okay
[17:04:33] <Whirl3d> lol sorry I didn't realize bot-t was so rude lately. LOL
[17:04:35] <qntb> so I have a form, and it has text in it
[17:04:40] <qntb> <form id="target" method="POST" action="fg.html"  >
[17:04:41] <qntb>     	First name: <input type="text" name="firstname" /><br />
[17:04:41] <qntb> 		First name2: <input type="inputtext" name="fairstname" /><br />
[17:04:41] <qntb> 		Password: <input type="password" name="pwd" />
[17:04:41] <qntb> 		<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
[17:04:41] <qntb> </form>
[17:04:44] <qntb> what I wnat to do
[17:04:45] <qntb> is
[17:04:54] <qntb> on form submitting
[17:04:58] <qntb> serialize the data
[17:05:00] <qntb> and alert it
[17:05:16] <qntb> I use something like this
[17:05:16] <qntb> $('form').submit(alertValues());
[17:05:22] <qntb>  function alertValues() {
[17:05:22] <qntb>       var str = $("form").serialize();
[17:05:22] <qntb>      alert(str);
[17:05:22] <qntb> 	 return false;
[17:05:26] <SkiOne> is there a way to suspend all jquery on page while you wait for input?
[17:05:28] <qntb> but for some reason it isnt working
[17:05:37] <Whirl3d> qntb,  listen to me:   when every you press enter and a line goes through irc, my computer makes this annoying beep over the top of my music.
[17:05:44] <SkiOne> wait nvm
[17:05:47] <Whirl3d> It's called spamming....don't do it.
[17:05:50] <jedimind> qntb, dont paste code in the channel
[17:05:56] <qntb> I'm sorry
[17:06:00] <qntb> I wont paste anymore
[17:06:09] <Whirl3d> if you want, go to jsfiddle.net and post your form (and some comments) and then share the url here
[17:06:34] <rjanja> qntb, try $('#target').bind('submit', function() { alert($(this).serialize()); return false; });
[17:06:40] <Whirl3d> it's a great way to get help. People (myself inlcluded) tend to look more favorably on requests for help that have a fiddle attached to them.
[17:08:05] <qntb> Okay, thanks. I'll try your suggestion
[17:09:00] <qntb> Thank you people, this is now working :)))
[17:09:21] <rjanja> cheers :)
[17:09:32] <qntb> Tho, how can I manipulate the serialized data
[17:09:44] <qntb> because it isnt in a var
[17:10:04] <qntb> (var serialized = $(this).serialize()); ?
[17:10:08] <qntb> should this work
[17:10:27] <qntb> doesnt work
[17:10:52] <rjanja> use ?serializeArray
[17:10:53] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[17:12:35] <qntb> Yes I saw that, however I need the serialized data in a string
[17:12:40] <qntb> so that I can edit it and parse it
[17:13:13] <rjanja> then what you had before is fine - it'll be like "one=1&two=2" etc
[17:13:55] <qntb> yes, but it doesn't provide me a variable so that I can perform regex later on it
[17:14:38] <rjanja> sounds like a scope issue - the variable is probably being created and set in a function
[17:15:09] <rjanja> declare the variable outside the function and set it inside
[17:16:55] <qntb> thanks, last time I tried to put the variable outside the scope, it failed on me
[17:53:23] <tocka> hey
[17:54:19] <tocka> maybe anyone else had same issue as me here: im validating my form by using jquery validate plugin, im checking is the username taken  using remote but sometimes "out from nowhere" it just doesnt give a response
[17:54:30] <tocka> maybe someone had the same issue?
[17:55:00] <rjanja> I bet someone could spot it if you reproduced your issue on jsbin
[17:55:09] <rjanja> or otherwise demonstrated it
[17:58:14] <tocka> rjanja it would be hard to do it.. POST pages/page/checke.php?id=checkEmail
[17:58:37] <tocka> I check if the the email/username was posted
[17:58:50] <tocka> through firebug
[17:59:06] <tocka> but I always get a red X
[17:59:30] <rjanja> what's the error code, if any?
[17:59:39] <tocka> Thats the problem
[17:59:42] <tocka> there is none
[17:59:58] <tocka> it doesnt even return a response
[18:00:03] <tocka> just nothing basically
[18:00:13] <rjanja> what's the error? surely there's some text to accompany the red X
[18:00:35] <tocka> POST pages/page/check.php?id=checkEmail
[18:00:35] <tocka> 22559ms	
[18:00:38] <tocka> and thats it
[18:01:54] <rjanja> 22 seconds? could be a timeout - have you tried replacing the url to one pointing at a static html page with whatever result your script is expecting?
[18:02:07] <tocka> noh i didint
[18:02:22] <rjanja> give 'er a try and see if you get the same thing
[18:02:56] <rjanja> also, if you have another browser to test it in, it would help trying it there
[18:07:46] <Bankzilla> Are you looping in your php page?
[18:08:15] <Bankzilla> Looks like an infinite loop
[18:08:42] <ionico> hi, i have an input that when i type something on it uses ajax to chech if the name alrady exist,  it works just fine, the problem is when i need to create the inputs dinamyc, i create them but the ajax request is not working

[18:44:43] <sample> hello there can you please help me on how to cache some ajax request so that it will be faster ?
[18:51:55] <serdem>  hey guys. when i serialize text (form datas) with jquery non-english characters get lost.
[18:52:13] <serdem> it messe up. how can i solve this?
[18:52:35] <serdem> any of you have any idea? it really gives me headache..
[18:53:07] <systemfault> Server-side issues?
[18:54:03] <serdem> ?
[18:54:32] <serdem> actually yes! it might be a php problem too.
[18:54:34] <serdem> nice
[18:55:00] <min|dvir|us> How do I get the current default easing algorithm?
[18:56:31] <serdem> systemfault, you havea any sugestion?
[18:56:38] <serdem> have*
[18:57:04] <systemfault> Well.. first of all, be sure that the page's encoding is utf-8
[19:00:55] <lordmortis> Okay, i'm clearly doing something silly: I'm trying to do a select dropdown replacer, and when i replace the select the new node (when displayed) appears higher up than it would if it wasn't inserted via jQuery. I've put up the relevant CSS and JS here: http://jsfiddle.net/VEwyb/2/ - anyone got any ideas?
[19:01:32] <lordmortis> (i'm using <select input node>.after(<newdropdownnode>) to do the insertion of the new DOM node)
[19:01:49] <lordmortis> Also, it happens in chrome but not firefox.
[19:02:01] <min|dvir|us> Anyone? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11255185/how-do-i-programmatically-get-the-current-default-easing-function-in-jquery
[19:05:57] <oojacoboo> with namespaces in jq/js does the order of the files loaded in matter for calling a method?
[19:06:16] <oojacoboo> do you need to instantiate the namespace
[19:06:16] <min|dvir|us> At least vote my question.
[19:12:32] <oojacoboo> wow, #jquery is dead
[19:12:44] <tw2113> weekend prep
[19:13:12] * coldhead np: the mercury program - the secret to quiet
[19:13:35] <coldhead> depends on what you're doing, oojacoboo
[19:13:42] <oojacoboo> figures
[19:14:34] <oojacoboo> I need to call a function that's in a namespace like… Company.App.Module.function()
[19:15:02] <oojacoboo> this particular function is define within the page's js loaded in, which is loaded AFTER the file in which it's being called from
[19:15:07] <oojacoboo> defined*
[19:15:24] <coldhead> so that will fail
[19:15:27] <oojacoboo> right
[19:15:29] <coldhead> you have to load it before you use it
[19:15:39] <oojacoboo> and if you shouldn't
[19:15:46] <oojacoboo> b/c that'd be bloat...
[19:15:47] <coldhead> you may be getting into module territory
[19:15:55] <coldhead> consider using require.js or some such
[19:16:10] <coldhead> then it will fetch stuff only when you need it
[19:16:14] <oojacoboo> mmm, can I not instantiate it somehow?
[19:16:14] <coldhead> and does dependencies etc
[19:16:24] <oojacoboo> coldhead, already doing that
[19:16:44] <oojacoboo> the js is dynamically loaded in and minified, etc
[19:16:45] <coldhead> i don't follow, how can you instantiate it if not by loading it
[19:16:51] <oojacoboo> coldhead, it's loaded
[19:16:57] <oojacoboo> just the order in which it's loaded...
[19:16:58] <coldhead> so then its free to use?
[19:17:21] <coldhead> i would just keep reordering the files until it worked
[19:17:25] <coldhead> i am lame
[19:17:33] <oojacoboo> coldhead, yea, that's not really possible
[19:17:54] <oojacoboo> this particular function is called from the global js file for the app
[19:18:02] <oojacoboo> but defined within the specific module's js
[19:18:20] <oojacoboo> both are within the "Company" namespace
[19:19:45] <coldhead> can you add some code to expose that function?
[19:19:51] <coldhead> or return it?
[19:19:57] <coldhead> so you can safely call it?
[19:20:01] <oojacoboo> not quite following
[19:20:21] <coldhead> i'll give you a very approximate demo
[19:23:34] <oojacoboo> coldhead, nm, I got it :)
[19:23:52] <oojacoboo> it's working fine within the namespace, it appears the issue was a freakin if that wasn't working :/
[19:24:07] <oojacoboo> thanks for the help :))
[19:24:35] <brianfreud> out of curiousity, why does jQuery use typeof, instead of .constructor?
[19:25:01] <coldhead> oojacoboo: something vaguely like http://jsfiddle.net/VHc9b/
[19:25:10] <coldhead> oh well, good work
[19:25:20] <coldhead> i'll go back to bed with this bottle of scotch and the raj quartet
[19:25:28] <oojacoboo> lol
[19:25:46] <brianfreud> eg, typeof target === "boolean" instead of target.constructor === Boolean
[19:26:07] <oojacoboo> brianfreud,  typeof is js
[19:26:26] <ohgodwhy> brianfreud browser support
[19:29:14] <brianfreud> oojacoboo, so is .constructor :P
[19:29:35] <brianfreud> ohgodwhy, I'm figuring that, yes, though I wonder how old a browser has to be to not support .constructor
[19:30:28] <brianfreud> I mean, it was part of the 1.1 spec
[19:34:35] <ohgodwhy> brianfreud, object constructors can still return undefined in release as early as IE 8.0xxx
[19:34:56] <brianfreud> ugh
[19:35:18] <brianfreud> too bad; it's like 3 times faster, and I'd guess it would minimize slightly better
[19:36:17] <ohgodwhy> brianfrued, yep, it's a dirty shame, even typeof isn't that reliable honestly, regexp returns as function, null is an object
[19:37:27] <min|dvir|us> Really, regex are functions?
[19:37:30] <min|dvir|us> That's fucked.
[19:38:03] <brianfreud> yeah, though .constructor is at least slightly less yuck than typeof :P
[19:38:22] * brianfreud finds it amusing that jQuery's constructor is "$", not "jQuery"
[19:39:08] <min|dvir|us> brianfreud, ...? $ = jQuery.
[19:39:47] <min|dvir|us> That's why you should always do jQuery(function ($) {}); to get a safe reference to $, in case another library is using it.
[19:40:43] <brianfreud> min|dvir|us, exactly... $ == jQuery, but not always
[19:41:10] <brianfreud> but do $('body').constructor.  I'd expect 'jQuery', rather than '$'
[19:44:50] <ecksit> hi, having a small issue with my jquery validate lib. Any reason why my inline JS isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/DezGu/
[19:47:03] <hariom> I am firing an $.load request and in the function of it, I am modifying the loaded html. It works some times but not other time

[19:51:27] <g2musicgroup> Hello I am a college student new to the Development world. I look forward to making new friends to help out along the way.
[19:51:46] <min|dvir|us> g2musicgroup, you're looking in the wrong place.
[19:55:09] <ohgodwhy> min|dvir|us: 10/10 would bang
[19:55:38] <coldhead> welcome, g2musicgroup
[19:57:09] <g2musicgroup> thanks, coldhead
[19:59:06] <g2musicgroup> Does anyone know whether there is a good javascript room?
[19:59:59] <min|dvir|us> g2musicgroup, ##javascript.
[20:01:06] <g2musicgroup> thanks minidvirlus
[20:01:27] <min|dvir|us> g2musicgroup, type 'min' and press Tab.
[20:01:56] <g2musicgroup> ha! Thanks min|dvir|us
[20:02:40] <min|dvir|us> Haha. minidvirlus.
[20:03:10] <ecksit> can't work out why the datepicker isn't running. http://jsfiddle.net/DezGu/1/ . it has to be something simple that i ma missing.
[20:04:00] <min|dvir|us> ecksit, where do you think js/jquery.validate.min.js is?
[20:04:14] <min|dvir|us> ecksit, whenever you develop in JavaScript, you have a console window open.
[20:04:28] <ecksit> I do, there isn't any errors
[20:04:49] <min|dvir|us> ecksit, click Update.
[20:05:21] <ecksit> what was the diff?
[20:06:01] <min|dvir|us> ecksit, the version of the page I see has errors, so I'm guessing you've updated it since this revision.
[20:06:31] <min|dvir|us> g2musicgroup, this is the official jQuery room.
[20:08:07] <g2musicgroup> I am having a problem with a Save Data function working within my form. Here is the repo for the app https://github.com/g2musicgroup/MIU/tree/master/Week4/Gold
[20:09:17] <ecksit> are you getting this error" Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'datepicker' min|dvir|us?
[20:09:29] <min|dvir|us> ecksit, I'm getting a bunch of 404s.
[20:09:49] <ecksit> probably because I have them locally stored in a project
[20:18:00] <hariom> How to check type of a js variable?
[20:18:11] <min|dvir|us> hariom, `typeof variable`.
[20:24:10] <PigDude> hariom, that depends on what check you're performing
[20:24:30] <PigDude> hariom, typeof is not sufficient to check for array, for instance
[20:25:37] <PigDude> hariom, you can use $.type(o)
[20:32:14] <oojacoboo> if I'm checking typeof on a return from php, likely a string, but a number only
[20:32:31] <oojacoboo> will typeof "number" match, or does it check the scalar?
[20:32:36] <oojacoboo> aka, it would be a string
[20:34:19] <min|dvir|us> oojacoboo, PHP doesn't interact with JS at all.
[20:34:33] <oojacoboo> min|dvir|us, realllllly???
[20:34:37] <oojacoboo> I had no idea....
[20:35:01] <oojacoboo> are you saying that the scalar isn't passed, thus the result is a string?
[20:35:11] <oojacoboo> that doesn't answer my question, regardless ;)
[20:36:27] <min|dvir|us> oojacoboo, `typeof variable`.
[20:36:39] <oojacoboo> min|dvir|us, ?
[20:36:54] <min|dvir|us> That is an expression that returns a string, like 'function' or 'object'.
[20:37:10] <oojacoboo> ok?
[20:37:32] <min|dvir|us> oojacoboo, just put it in your console and see what it spits out.
[20:37:37] <oojacoboo> I'm asking if php is returning a number 123, how can I check if that's a number
[20:37:51] <oojacoboo> min|dvir|us, oh, I see what you mean now
[20:38:21] <min|dvir|us> oojacoboo, look.
[20:38:31] <min|dvir|us> You can check if a PHP variable is a number.
[20:38:36] <oojacoboo> I see what you're saying
[20:38:37] <min|dvir|us> Or you can check if a JS variable is a number.
[20:38:46] <oojacoboo> I'm checking on the js side
[20:39:02] <min|dvir|us> Then don't talk about PHP.
[20:39:03] <min|dvir|us> At all.
[20:39:29] <oojacoboo> yea, so, it's a string of course, as I thought
[20:39:34] <oojacoboo> so back to the original question
[20:39:40] <oojacoboo> how can I check if that string is a number
[20:39:50] <min|dvir|us> oojacoboo, parseInt(string).
[20:40:03] <oojacoboo> I don't want to convert it to a string if it's not a number
[20:40:12] <oojacoboo> or does that check?
[20:40:16] <min|dvir|us> It does both.
[20:40:20] <oojacoboo> ok, cool, thanks
[20:41:02] <oojacoboo> min|dvir|us, what does that return if it's not a string?
[20:41:07] <min|dvir|us> TIAS.
[20:41:53] <oojacoboo> it's ok to say you don't know ;)
[20:42:16] <min|dvir|us> oojacoboo, you shouldn't ask questions you can easily answer.
[20:42:24] <min|dvir|us> IRC should be the last place you ask.
[20:42:55] <oojacoboo> now I'm getting IRC lectures
[20:43:04] <oojacoboo> *sigh*
[20:44:04] <min|dvir|us> oojacoboo, you didn't even try to answer your own question. A sign of incompetence.
[20:44:05] * MadonnaIsTheBest is listening to Madonna - Justify My Love
[21:04:41] <EyePulp>  is there a way to get ajaxSuccess to run before the success: callback within an .ajax() request?
[21:05:14] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: success:function(){setTimeout(callback,0)}
[21:07:00] <EyePulp> johnkpaul: any way to avoid having to modify every .ajax() call specifically? I'd like to have a global "middleware" of sorts checking out returned ajax calls before the "local" success callback runs
[21:07:09] <oojacoboo> EyePulp, there is also a beforeSend callback
[21:07:36] <oojacoboo> when beforeSend callback is invoked; it receives the jqXHR object and the settings map as parameters.
[21:07:36] <EyePulp> oojacoboo: nope - I need to operate on the returned value
[21:07:58] <oojacoboo> returned from the ajax request?
[21:08:04] <EyePulp> (assuming beforeSend is happening when I think it is)
[21:08:15] <oojacoboo> why wouldn't that be success?
[21:08:42] <EyePulp> oojacoboo: I don't understand your question
[21:08:55] <oojacoboo> "nope - I need to operate on the returned value"
[21:09:07] <oojacoboo> returned from the ajax request?
[21:12:34] <EyePulp> oojacoboo: ajaxSuccess() seems to get fired after the "success" callback within ajax().  I need ajaxSuccess to be fired *before* the success: callback() .  I don't think this is possible, without modifying every ajax request to do a timeout in the success: callback
[21:13:24] <Stephen> Anyone know a good channel for discussing microdata?
[21:13:28] <oojacoboo> EyePulp, have you looked into deferreds?
[21:13:31] <sente> microdata?
[21:13:37] <sente> like the opposite of big data?
[21:13:41] <Stephen> er, microformats
[21:13:45] <Stephen> or these guys:
[21:13:49] <Stephen> http://schema.org
[21:14:13] <Stephen> hmm... maybe #html5
[21:14:16] <EyePulp> oojacoboo: nope - just started looking @ ajaxSuccess, and here I am. =)
[21:14:37] <oojacoboo> EyePulp, I don't know exactly what you're trying to do, but you might find deferreds to be a help
[21:14:55] <oojacoboo> basically a promise on success, etc
[21:15:08] <EyePulp> oojacoboo: I'll take a look -- thanks for the tip.
[21:16:57] <Stephen> EyePulp: So you need a single function to be called before the actual function provided to the ajaxSuccess property?
[21:17:26] <Stephen> Does this need to happen everytime, or are there certain conditions where it would need to be fired?
[21:19:47] <Stephen> EyePulp: You may want to look into axajComplete()
[21:19:49] <Stephen> er
[21:19:53] <Stephen> ajaxComplete()
[21:21:48] <EyePulp> Stephen: that's interesting - timing wise it gets called before ajaxSuccess I assume
[21:22:11] <Stephen> EyePulp: Don't assume that, test it
[21:22:21] <Stephen> It's possible it's called very last
[21:22:22] <EyePulp> of course. =)
[21:23:21] <Stephen> I know those methods were set to be deprecated in 1.8 in favor of done(), fail(), and always()
[21:23:41] <EyePulp> oh really?
[21:24:26] <Stephen> Well, basically, you know that deferred object oojacoboo mentioned?
[21:24:27] <Stephen> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[21:24:50] <Stephen> jquery.ajax returns one of those
[21:26:09] <Stephen> so $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "example.php", data : {id : 1}}).atthispointcallanymethodondeferreds
[21:27:15] <EyePulp> interesting
[21:28:23] <EyePulp> how would one add global behaviors to ajax calls under the deferred approach?
[21:28:52] <Stephen> hmm..
[21:30:18] <oojacoboo> just create a global function and call it with the deferred each time
[21:30:36] <oojacoboo> .done(callThisFunction())
[21:31:04] <oojacoboo> or, build out a ajax function and just pass it the params
[21:31:21] <oojacoboo> doMyAjax(this, that, id, blah)
[21:33:58] <Stephen> if you /really/ need to change the behavior of all deferreds, you could always override the prototype, but that object is used quite a bit in jQuery core
[21:34:01] <EyePulp> getting the rest of the codebase and developers to use my wrapper around .ajax() wouldn't be worth the headache.  There's not enough benefit to justify the annoyance/maintenace factor.  I think ultimately I'll live with a slightly less perfect vision of a zero-friction solution to this.
[21:34:23] <EyePulp> *maintenance
[21:34:26] <Stephen> and I can't guarantee there'd be anyway to figure out if the creating method was an ajax call
[21:34:28] <oojacoboo> EyePulp, I agree
[21:34:46] <Stephen> EyePulp: thrice
[21:34:57] <oojacoboo> just call a global function with the deferred
[21:35:23] <oojacoboo> we have a ton of ajax calls and often call global functions from each
[21:35:47] <oojacoboo> there is some code replication, but it's really not bad and ends up offering us flexibility we need
[21:35:54] <Stephen> hmm... does .ajax throw any events as it completes?
[21:35:55] <EyePulp> I'm just going to do a pub/sub event and subscribe items that would care for the incoming data.
[21:36:15] <systemfault> What's the problem?
[21:37:12] <Stephen> EyePulp: Am I correct in thinking you're wanting to throw all data grabbed into a general cache which can be read from by any object on the page?
[21:38:52] <EyePulp> stephen - winner winner - chicken dinner!  and the data may come back updated on occasional ajax requests, so I want to listen for that, and update the data when it's provided (without having to do so on every ajax call manually).  That part works fine with ajaxSuccess -- the only annoyance was one item...
[21:40:29] <oojacoboo> EyePulp, we call a specific function to update the json when we know we need to
[21:40:38] <oojacoboo> and cache it
[21:40:46] <EyePulp> that annoyance being if the fresh data came back, and the success: callback() needed to use the fresh data, it has to look directly into the json payload, versus using the global datastore and its search/access.
[21:40:47] <oojacoboo> then parse it as needed as well
[21:41:16] <Stephen> So, yeah, I'd wrap jquery.ajax
[21:41:34] <Stephen> Have your cache object control the requests
[21:41:42] <EyePulp> oojacoboo: that's fine, and that's how I have to do it, I think.  I just wanted to find a slightly more frictionless option.
[21:42:14] <oojacoboo> EyePulp, yea, it'd be nice to not have to do it for every instance, but generally speaking, it's not that bad
[21:42:36] <oojacoboo> plus, you'd still have to do the ajax request and compare, no?
[21:43:06] <Stephen> Well, if you always wanted updated data, comparing wouldn't be a big deal
[21:43:25] <oojacoboo> Stephen, yea, but the extra http requests aren't really all that welcome, IMO
[21:43:27] <Stephen> You might consider looking into how Sencha (ExtJS) writes their stores
[21:43:36] <EyePulp> it's almost like middleware for the request/response cycle
[21:43:49] <oojacoboo> I'd rather not hit the webserver more than needed
[21:44:29] <Stephen> EyePulp: Are you looking to reduce trips to the server, or are you looking to centralize data storage so 1 place always has updated data, no matter who requested?
[21:45:12] <oojacoboo> who?
[21:45:14] <EyePulp> Stephen - #1 is always a goal, and #2 is the more conscious motivator
[21:45:15] <Stephen> oojacoboo: I agree, it's a trade off between up-to-date data & consise memory usage
[21:45:20] <oojacoboo> we're talking about the DOM :P
[21:46:32] <systemfault> DOMination
[21:47:01] <Stephen> :-) Well, then, make use of HEADER requests, and set a (very small) buffer time on your requests so they can be consolidated on return :-)
[21:47:31] <systemfault> HEADER?
[21:47:48] <Stephen> If you're clever enough, have the server return appropriate codes to earlier requests that the data is found but will be returned in a consolidated object to the latest request
[21:47:52] <systemfault> Or you mean HEAD?
[21:47:53] <Stephen> er, HEAD requests
[21:47:56] <Stephen> my bad
[21:48:08] <Stephen> (too much HTML5 reading today)
[21:48:11] <systemfault> :D
[21:48:24] <oojacoboo> Stephen, or pass the parameters to your getJson() function so it only gets what's needed
[21:48:29] <oojacoboo> then parse only that piece into the DOM
[21:48:37] <coldhead> got any good reads worth sharing, Stephen?
[21:49:22] <Stephen> Hmm
[21:50:32] <Stephen> Not sure if I know any place this stuff is written down. My ideas come from a hodge-podge of taking the best of jquery and extjs
[21:54:35] <rabbi1> is there any difference btwn modal form and modal dialog ?
[21:55:12] <systemfault> I don't think a modal form exists.
[21:56:21] <Stephen> modal dialogs have native forms in some browsers
[21:56:32] <Stephen> Modal forms are just forms inside of modal dialogs
[21:56:41] <Stephen> And I don't believe they are ever natively supported
[21:58:17] <rabbi1> Stephen: but, i have a datepicker and ajax search inside the modal, but once it is reloaded from the server, the datepicker/ ajax search doesn't work
[21:58:39] <systemfault> Normal… the reload killed them...
[21:59:15] <Stephen> "Doesn't work"
[21:59:21] <Stephen> Please be more descriptive
[21:59:27] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah, but how can i overcome this ?
[21:59:37] <Stephen> Do they not display, or are they displaying with invalid data?
[21:59:40] <asteig> I'm using qUnit for tests. It keeps dying when things are undefined. I'm alright with that, but should I be avoiding the "Died on test #1" error messages? Or should these be laid out in a cascading manner?
[21:59:51] <systemfault> rabbi1: Usually, using event delegation instead of classic event handlers.
[22:00:04] <rabbi1> Stephen: no, the datepicker doesn't load the calendar
[22:00:50] <Stephen> rabbi1: The quick answer is a) use an ajax post instead of reloading or b) save the data to a cookie or other localStorage, and have the control look first to that data source before trying a remote load
[22:01:25] <Stephen> I think you'll find a) teaches you much more, and gives a cleaner interface
[22:03:17] <Stephen> rabbi1: If you're speaking specifically about a jquery-ui datepicker, I'd suggest #jqueryui or #jquery-ui (not sure which is official)
[22:04:11] <hariom> I have created an array var html = [];  and then running a loop in which for each index i, I am adding an html string fragment to html. Later I am forming bigger string as: 'some other string' + html.join('') + 'some other string'. But I get exception thrown by jquery
[22:04:26] <hariom> "Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMDocumentFragment.appendChild]"
[22:04:31] <rabbi1> Stephen: o, ok, thank you .... :)
[22:05:01] <systemfault> hariom: More info please?
[22:06:29] <hariom> var html = []; for (i=0; i<100; i++) { html[i] = '<div id=" + i + '">' ... ; }   var finalHtml = 'first' + html.join('') + 'last';  I get exception while doing this
[22:06:39] <hariom> systemfault: var html = []; for (i=0; i<100; i++) { html[i] = '<div id=" + i + '">' ... ; }   var finalHtml = 'first' + html.join('') + 'last';  I get exception while doing this
[22:07:11] <systemfault> hariom: It doesn't make sense.. you code doesn't have any DOM interaction.
[22:07:16] <systemfault> *your
[22:07:46] <hariom> systemfault: I am building an html fragment inside a loop
[22:07:59] <hariom> systemfault: '...' means some extra code
[22:08:27] <Stephen> hariom: in that case , one of your fragments is invalid
[22:08:36] <systemfault> Probably...
[22:08:46] <systemfault> Still.. his code doesn't touch the DOM.
[22:08:50] <systemfault> NEED MORE INFO.
[22:08:59] <Stephen> true
[22:09:12] <Stephen> hariom: Where are you calling appendChild()?
[22:09:19] <systemfault> Is he even closing his tags?
[22:09:23] <Stephen> can you show at least where it falls?
[22:09:39] <Stephen> and yeah, div's need closing tags
[22:09:43] <hariom> Stephen: not calling appendChild() but doing html.join('')
[22:09:48] <systemfault> It could be anything.. really.
[22:10:02] <systemfault> hariom: how are you creating the fragment?
[22:10:29] <systemfault> You know.. the part where your string become DOM nodes..
[22:11:31] <Stephen> hariom: Contrary to what you're leading to, .join() doesn't throw that error. You're hunting down the wrong path
[22:11:43] <systemfault> .join is javascript.. not DOM
[22:11:43] <socialhapy> systemfault: Sorry, admins only
[22:11:52] <systemfault> ...
[22:11:57] <Stephen> eh, let's move on
[22:12:19] <hariom> Stephen: You are right. I commented that code and still getting error. Let me further go ahead and pin point the error.
[22:16:06] <hariom> Stephen: At one place I was not converting html [] to string using join() and was adding it to .html( )
[22:16:14] <hariom> thanks
[22:23:37] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[22:23:54] <coldhead> hello little friend

[23:19:08] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[23:19:11] <coldhead> thought this was my shell
[23:19:33] <coldhead> bash: test: test: unary operator expected
[23:19:47] <lordmortis> lol
[23:20:13] <systemfault> ?eval (new Array(10)).join('TEST ');

[23:23:09] <vl1234> GM
[23:23:24] <vl1234> any 1 know to disbale the table?
[23:24:01] <systemfault> What is disabling a table supposed to fo? :/
[23:24:01] <coldhead> $('table').attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[23:24:04] <coldhead> ?cc
[23:24:04] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[23:24:11] <systemfault> *do
[23:25:22] <ndss56> how to add a picture on local pc to jsfiddle?
[23:25:34] <coldhead> upload to imgur.com
[23:25:47] <ndss56> coldhead: cheers bro
[23:36:04] <Xotix> is there anythign better then jsfiddle? it's slow as hell
[23:36:30] <vl1234> @coldhead....am tried but not getting
[23:37:24] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, jsbin
[23:38:47] <Xotix> blackspotwiggins:  thx
[23:43:04] <Xotix> is it possible to prevent content within a contenteditable div do be deleteable? e.g. an image?
[23:45:58] <coldhead> and watch the waves and move the faders
[23:46:52] <Cork> Xotix: well not better, but theres a lot of alternatives
[23:47:10] <Stephen> Xotix: Sort of
[23:47:26] <Cork> (to jsfiddle that is)
[23:47:47] <Xotix> Cork yeah just until jsfiddle is fast again. Anyway thanks
[23:47:55] <Stephen> Xotix: You can mark a child element as contenteditable, but that just makes it delete as all 1 element
[23:48:34] <Xotix> no i mean that i have a contenteditable di and within this div i got an image and i want the image to be not deletable.
[23:49:39] <Stephen> Hmm...
[23:50:35] <Stephen> No simple attribute to do that with. You'd need to make 2 contentEditable elements around it separately
[23:53:28] <Stephen> Or, you might find a way to hook the "Undo" command any time it's deleted
[23:59:27] <TheresaJayne> can anyone advise for a problem i am having
[23:59:33] <lordmortis> depends on the problem
[23:59:53] <coldhead> can you be more specific
