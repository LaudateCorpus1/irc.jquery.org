[00:00:38] <MoTiOnXml> Whirl3d: thanks, i totally forgot about that
[00:01:27] <Whirl3d> $("input").each(function () {$(this).attr("placeholder", $(this).attr("title"))});
[00:01:52] <tavl> i'm completely new to jQuery, but could someone tell me how to store the "raw" json returned from a "getJSON" call, without caring about its fields or values? All I want is to save the result in an external array and register the "completed" callback to draw my grid...
[00:02:33] <tavl> (the called URL returns a plain JSON message, requiring no further processing)
[00:04:56] <GyroB> morning all
[00:09:43] <xkunalx> hey anyone know how to prevent data from an ajax call from getting exposed to the public?
[00:09:49] <xkunalx> i want to avoid the json data from showing up in the browser, only used by my app.
[00:09:54] <xkunalx> like localhost/images/recentImages ... this renders json in the browser, which i want to avoid.
[00:12:28] <beasty> xkunalx: ?
[00:12:37] <xkunalx> yes?
[00:12:47] <beasty> how do you mean ? you want to prevent that ...
[00:13:43] <gf3> xkunalx: then don't send it
[00:14:50] <xkunalx> beasty: it needs to be accessed by javascript on my page
[00:15:09] <xkunalx> but i dont want that json data to be visible publicly from the browser
[00:15:30] <gf3> well it will be
[00:16:48] <beasty> indeed
[00:17:03] <beasty> or you can decrypt your js file
[00:17:10] <beasty> but that's lame
[00:18:07] <xkunalx> how does deacryption come in?
[00:18:15] <xkunalx> http://localhost/images/recentImages
[00:18:29] <xkunalx> that is publicly accessible. hostname to be changed of course.
[00:18:38] <xkunalx> it shouldnt be accessible from the browser - it shows json right no
[00:18:41] <xkunalx> it shouldnt be accessible from the browser - it shows json right now
[00:18:55] <gigafied> xkunalx, you are seriously misguided
[00:19:31] <xkunalx> gigafied: how so
[00:19:38] <gigafied> anything you access through javascript from the browser is publicly visible
[00:19:43] <gigafied> there is no way around that at all
[00:20:09] <gigafied> and why are you posting http://localhost links
[00:24:42] <dr0id> LoL
[00:25:03] <Bheam> yo
[00:25:07] <gf3> NO U
[00:25:33] <dr0id> yo
[00:25:51] <Bheam> i'm using $('BODY').append('<div><form><input></form></div>'); and it seems to show fine, but when i submit the form, it doesn't post but only redirects to the form "action", any ideas?
[00:26:24] <Bheam> unless i'm being uber noob i'm starting to suspect my isp "transparent" proxy to be to blame :/
[00:27:47] <gf3> Bheam: set the method to POST
[00:28:10] <gf3> Bheam: ALSO Y U USE UPPERCASE SELECTORS LIKE 1998!??!
[00:30:49] <Bheam> i set method to post and everything =/
[00:31:04] <Whirl3d> and 98 was a good year!
[00:31:25] <Bheam> $('BODY').append('<div class="loginpopup '+type+'"><H1>'+type+' login:</H1><form method="post" action="?menuid='+(type == "partner" ? 11 : 0)+'" style="border: 1px solid green; display: block;"><div><input type="hidden" name="login" value="1">E-mail:<br><input type="text" name="username"><br><br>Passord:<br><input type="password" name="password"><br><br><input type="submit" value="Login"></di
[00:31:26] <Bheam> v></form></div>');
[00:31:46] <Bheam> i uppercase tags and lowercase classes *shrug* just my way
[00:33:26] <gf3> Bheam: make a jsfiddle, plz
[00:33:39] <Bheam> a what...
[00:33:41] <Whirl3d> How can I prevent an input element from losing focus when a button is clicked?
[00:34:25] <Whirl3d> Bheam, http://www.jsfiddle.net/
[00:37:10] <heatxsink> are there any known techniques to get around javascript execution timeouts?
[00:37:26] <heatxsink> other than chunking what one is processing into parts and using setTimeout?
[00:38:41] <gigafied> web workers
[00:38:53] <gigafied> https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_web_workers
[00:39:52] <gf3> Whirl3d: just give it focus again after the click
[00:40:14] <heatxsink> gigafied: is that for me?
[00:40:24] <gigafied> yeah heatxsik, sorry
[00:40:50] <heatxsink> gigafied: thank you!
[00:41:28] <Whirl3d> gf3, okay, i'll try that. I want to make an incremental button that changes the value in an input field without (appearing to) lose focus.
[00:41:44] <Whirl3d> gf3, thx for the input
[00:41:48] <gf3> np
[00:52:14] <Whirl3d> in an element's blur focushandler, how do you tell what the new focus target is?
[00:53:18] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, document.activeElement iirc
[00:54:12] <Whirl3d> blackspotwiggins, better than the :focus selector?
[00:54:21] <blackspotwiggins> you tell me
[00:54:24] <blackspotwiggins> which is faster
[00:54:31] <blackspotwiggins> doing a :focus query
[00:54:37] <blackspotwiggins> or getting the answer straight from dom
[00:54:44] <Whirl3d> blackspotwiggins, I see...
[00:54:52] <Whirl3d> blackspotwiggins, thanks for your help
[00:59:56] <sorahn> join #irssi
[00:59:58] <sorahn> derp
[01:02:27] <BinaryKitten> sorahn was a join #fail?
[01:13:47] <GoSox> I'm a little confused on how to use .animate()
[01:14:20] <GoSox> for one thing, can I use any numeric based style (like background-position?) or does it only work on a few specific properties?
[01:14:54] <GoSox> also, the number i define in the animate function, is that number the "difference" i want an object to move, or the final position i want that object to have?
[01:18:48] <Whirl3d> GoSox, it's the final position unless you include the plus or minus like "+10px"
[01:19:15] <GoSox> oh so it can be either
[01:19:35] <Whirl3d> GoSox, I'm not sure if they fixed it, but at one point there was a problem with animating background position. I think everything else works okay...not completely sure though.
[01:22:42] <GoSox> would i use -128px or -=128px
[01:22:52] <GoSox> i'm seeing both
[01:22:59] <Whirl3d> "-128px"
[01:23:06] <Whirl3d> with the quotes
[01:23:51] <GoSox> argh i keep looking up stuff that turns out to be using a plugin, not just plain old jquery
[01:24:05] <Whirl3d> stick with api.jquery.com
[01:27:55] <Whirl3d> if you are using css to give your anchor elements a rollover effect and you disable the element, how do you disable the rollover effect?
[01:28:22] <GoSox> i have an answer for that
[01:28:43] <Whirl3d> GoSox, let's hear it...
[01:29:03] <GoSox> http://www.whatsmyip.org/style.css
[01:29:11] <GoSox> search for this selector: .button_class:not([disabled]):active
[01:29:29] <GoSox> use that so the effect only works if the button is not disabled
[01:29:42] <GoSox> or in your case, you'd do :hover
[01:30:07] <Whirl3d> in my css?
[01:30:17] <GoSox> yes
[01:31:07] <Whirl3d> Thanks, I'll try it
[01:31:30] <GoSox> although i don't think you can disable A tags
[01:42:32] <GoSox> so my animation works but it's kind of choppy. is there any way to make it smoother, or is that as good as it gets?
[01:42:32] <GoSox> http://www.macfixer.net/
[01:43:51] <Whirl3d> under troubleshooting?
[01:44:02] <GoSox> you mean above?
[01:44:22] <Whirl3d> lol, yeah...
[01:44:26] <GoSox> yes
[01:44:34] <Whirl3d> I meant under the topic troubleshooting...but it's above the words
[01:44:38] <GoSox> note that's a test image
[01:45:00] <Whirl3d> seems pretty smooth to me
[01:45:05] <GoSox> hmm
[01:45:10] <Whirl3d> you might want to add easing to it
[01:45:12] <GoSox> maybe its just my browser acting weird
[01:45:35] <GoSox> i thought the 'good' easing was the default easing
[01:46:13] <Whirl3d> I almost never use the default easing. I prefer "easeOutBack" and "easeInOutBack" for a lot of things.
[01:46:39] <GoSox> you need plugins for those though, right?
[01:47:15] <Whirl3d> sure. but the easing plugin is tiny
[01:47:22] <Whirl3d> ?.easing
[01:47:24] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Easing - Plugins - jQuery - Allows you to set custom easing types for standard animations. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Easing
[01:49:33] <GoSox> i have a bigger problem
[01:49:44] <GoSox> my animation is only working in IE and webkit, not firefox and opera :(
[01:50:13] <GoSox> and yet there's so little to it: http://pastebin.com/fxd61jE3
[01:51:28] <kwaak2> Hi, can someone look at this jsfiddle and tell me which jQuery traverse method to use? http://jsfiddle.net/3cEey/
[01:53:49] <Whirl3d> GoSox, maybe try defining your background position explicitly (not using the shortcut syntax) like background-position-x to start with
[01:54:19] <IvanKuzev> van you helpme....why i get XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/kapriz/GS/starlist.txt. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[01:54:39] <IvanKuzev> when the website i run is in the same folder
[01:54:47] <Whirl3d> kwaak2, try .next
[01:55:29] <GoSox> background-position-x doesn't work in ANY browser
[01:56:41] <Whirl3d> IvanKuzev, http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47416
[01:59:08] <Whirl3d> GoSox, I'm assuming that $i is a global variable?
[01:59:13] <GoSox> yes
[01:59:23] <logicrises> hi jquery'ers... any1 come across a situation where you need to access a cookie site wide.
[01:59:24] <GoSox> i'm just giving up and downloading the background position plugin
[01:59:50] <Whirl3d> GoSox, where do you initialize $i?
[02:00:16] <GoSox> ok am i dumb or what? i can't see how you download plugins from the plugin site?
[02:00:20] <logicrises> ive got the jquery cookie plugin and set the path to / but i think the path needs to be the current page to be readable
[02:00:39] <GoSox> Whirl3d: i initialize it BEFORE the $(function() {});
[02:01:39] <Whirl3d> in which script though. I don't see it in homepage.js or main.js
[02:01:52] <GoSox> its on the actual home page
[02:02:03] <Subhra> hello
[02:02:38] <mansoor> logicrises: cookie permissions are casscading when it comes to paths. "child" paths will inherit the permission of the parent. If the cookie is set to path /,  all paths after  / will also have access to it
[02:03:32] <GoSox> Whirl3d: find it?
[02:03:40] <GoSox> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/backgroundPosition-Effect
[02:03:50] <GoSox> does the message on that page mean that you can't download plugins right now?
[02:03:51] <Whirl3d> GoSox, I'm prolly an idiot but I didn't find $i anywhere in your source either
[02:04:27] <GoSox> Whirl3d: line ~17 of www.macfixer.net/index.php
[02:05:09] <logicrises> If I set the path to "/" then it doesnt work on the current page I am on: e.g. example.com/this/page
[02:05:11] <Whirl3d> firebug couldn't find it...lol
[02:05:20] <GoSox> what do you mean?
[02:05:52] <alessioalex> Hello
[02:06:09] <alessioalex> How do I get the function that's binded by jQuery to an element's click event?
[02:06:35] <GoSox> so much for going to bed at 5
[02:07:04] <mansoor> logicrises: then something else is wrong
[02:08:45] <Whirl3d> GoSox, couldn't you just wrap the image in a div that had overflow hidden. Then just animate the image position?
[02:09:08] <GoSox> i suppose i could
[02:09:20] <Whirl3d> Might solve your problem without needing a plugin
[02:09:25] <GoSox> true
[02:09:35] <GoSox> speaking of plugins, can i steal your easing plugin
[02:10:11] <alessioalex> Does anybody know how I can get the function that's binded by jQuery to an element's click event?
[02:10:12] <Whirl3d> let me upload it...brb
[02:10:48] <logicrises> mansoor, ill do some more digging
[02:11:40] <Whirl3d> GoSox, http://www.whirl3d.com/downloads/jquery.easing.1.3.js
[02:12:05] <GoSox> that thing has a hell of a lot of fine print!
[02:12:20] <GoSox> got it thanks
[02:12:48] <Whirl3d> It's all robert penner's easing formula's...
[02:13:43] <barfoo365> In ie7, Can anyone see why the text is displaying outside of the container in this simple jquery ticker? http://jsfiddle.net/kw6pT/  Do you think I would be better off asking in #css?
[02:14:50] <Whirl3d> barfoo365, personally, my experience in #css has never been good. It's a harsh cruel channel for folks who aren't css pros...
[02:15:46] <logicrises> mansoor, I left cookies everywhere when i wasn't using cookie path of "/". Its all fixed. Thanks mate
[02:16:08] <GoSox> Whirl3d: doing it your way: http://www.macfixer.net/
[02:16:27] <heatxsink> gigafied: yt?
[02:16:36] <heatxsink> gigafied: webworkers are still kinda balls
[02:16:36] <GoSox> Whirl3d: haha yeah they're super elitist, i called them out on it the other day
[02:16:43] <gigafied> kinda balls?
[02:16:44] <GoSox> they don't like it when people ask CSS questions in there
[02:17:19] <heatxsink> gigafied: i guess it could be jquery.tmpl holding up the processing
[02:17:45] <Whirl3d> GoSox, glad to know I'm not the only one...pfew. You got the animation working! congrats.
[02:18:16] <GoSox> i liked moving teh background image better than moving an actual image tag
[02:18:22] <GoSox> but alas, your way WORKS so ill go with it :D
[02:18:34] <gigafied> heatxsink: what do you mean by kinda balls?
[02:18:59] <heatxsink> gigafied: well i'm having this javascript execution timeout in mobile safari
[02:19:48] <heatxsink> gigafied: so i moved all of my processing to a webworker and now i'm definitely not getting that execution timeout but it's much longer than expected to render my results into the dom
[02:21:04] <heatxsink> gigafied: so what i'm doing is laying into the page a pretty large json object, i traverse the object and render parts of the page using jquery.tmpl
[02:21:39] <gigafied> how large are we talking?
[02:21:51] <heatxsink> one sec...
[02:22:00] <josefrichter> guys, what's the correct syntax if I want a selector like $("this>ul>li") please?
[02:22:22] <logicrises> josefrichter, $(this).find('>ul>li')
[02:22:25] <GoSox> hey Whirl3d do you know of a demo page where i can view all of these easing options?
[02:22:30] <gigafied> this.find(">ul>li");
[02:22:36] <josefrichter> logicrises thanks
[02:22:42] <gigafied> yeah, what he said
[02:22:45] <josefrichter> gigafied thanks
[02:22:59] <logicrises> haha
[02:23:29] <gigafied> or this.children("ul").children("li"); :p
[02:23:36] <heatxsink> gigafied: ~20kb
[02:23:43] <gigafied> that's not that big
[02:23:49] <heatxsink> gigafied: agreed
[02:24:16] <josefrichter> one more: what does this selector actually do? I mean the ul in the selector> $("li", ul)
[02:24:54] <gigafied> why were you getting the execution time out in the first place? Are you doing some expensive computational stuff like collision detection or something?
[02:25:46] <Whirl3d> GoSox, search for flash easing tool. It's flash, but it gives you a demonstration of the easing types.
[02:26:01] <GoSox> actually the link in the comments of the file has demos
[02:26:07] <GoSox> which ones did you say you liked?
[02:26:14] <gigafied> or this
[02:26:15] <gigafied> http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/
[02:26:19] <dr0id> gigafied: you can't use this
[02:26:22] <dr0id> use $(this)
[02:27:05] <Whirl3d> GoSox, try this: http://robertpenner.com/easing/easing_demo.html
[02:27:06] <heatxsink> gigafied: ah.... more like 225k
[02:27:09] <gigafied> heh, depends, but yes in most scenarios it's $(this);
[02:27:22] <heatxsink> gigafied: i was off by 1 order of magnitude
[02:27:34] <Whirl3d> it really depends. I just like EaseOutBack and EaseInOutBack
[02:28:25] <GoSox> Whirl3d: what do you think of this: http://www.macfixer.net/
[02:28:31] <gigafied> heatxsink: hmm, well it depends on how crazy your logic is again. You're better off splitting that into several pieces though
[02:28:34] <GoSox> thats kinda cool
[02:28:35] <gigafied> and rendering it by bits
[02:28:52] <heatxsink> gotcha
[02:29:05] <Whirl3d> I think you should wait until everything else is loaded before starting your animation...it gets jumpy at first
[02:29:27] <GoSox> well yeah i have it repeat fast so i don't have to wait so long while debugging
[02:29:31] <gigafied> I've dealt with visualizer large amounts of data, on numerous occasions, and you always want some sort of pagination or polling in place
[02:29:37] <gigafied> visualizing*
[02:29:41] <Whirl3d> Are you using back or bounce
[02:29:43] <GoSox> once i have eveyrthing worked out, i'm going to replace those app icons with actual images
[02:29:53] <GoSox> "easeOutElastic
[02:30:18] <Whirl3d> try it with easeoutback, it's less "bouncy"
[02:30:31] <gigafied> Even if it's not in reading the data, you should at least be rendering in chunks. I'd assume that out of that 225kb of JSON you have a rather large array that you could step through?
[02:30:42] <GoSox> Whirl3d: its there now
[02:30:52] <GoSox> bounce don't feel right when it's not going with gravity
[02:31:08] <Whirl3d> that's bounce, right?
[02:31:19] <GoSox> right now yes its outBounce
[02:31:21] <heatxsink> GoSox: this is pretty neat http://coldmac.macfixer.net/
[02:31:26] <GoSox> thanks
[02:31:34] <GoSox> its my little winter thing
[02:31:36] <codeho> yikes
[02:31:40] <Whirl3d> try easeOutBack...it's better than both bounce and elastic
[02:31:52] <heatxsink> gigafied: yes it's an array of objects
[02:32:10] <heatxsink> gigafied: and each of those objects has an array of objects
[02:32:31] <GoSox> Whirl3d: yeah so i'm realizing that i should go finalize my images, and play with easing some other time
[02:32:32] <codeho> heatxsink: nick?
[02:32:36] <GoSox> because i could do this shit all day!
[02:32:43] <woozly> Guys, who can help with it? [XML] => http://pastie.org/3051606 . why It says I haven't declare element? :/
[02:32:44] <Whirl3d> LOL
[02:32:46] <heatxsink> the first leaf is shallow the second leaf max number of children has a little less than 200
[02:32:47] <Whirl3d> have a good one.
[02:32:49] <heatxsink> codeho: hi
[02:32:52] <codeho> wow
[02:32:55] <codeho> <- thorsten
[02:32:58] <GoSox> thanks for the help!
[02:32:59] <heatxsink> nice
[02:33:06] <heatxsink> codeho: whats up hoe!
[02:33:10] <GoSox> and for holding the elitism
[02:33:20] <codeho> kicking it at the motherland. and yourself?
[02:33:30] <heatxsink> codeho: workin' yo
[02:33:36] <codeho> whatcha coin these days?
[02:33:41] <codeho> *doin
[02:33:49] <heatxsink> codeho: all over the place as usual
[02:34:00] <codeho> right on
[02:34:17] <heatxsink> codeho: trying to make mobile safari do some stupid crap
[02:34:22] <codeho> heatxsink: still at the evil empire?
[02:34:27] <heatxsink> codeho: hell no
[02:34:35] <codeho> heatxsink: thats good :)
[02:34:46] <gigafied> heatxsink: is it just a mobile safari issue?
[02:35:39] <heatxsink> gigafied: well the javascript execution timeout only happens in mobile safari apparently apple changed it in ios5
[02:37:13] <gigafied> Easiest way around that is probably a setTimeout(fn,0); or setInterval(fn, 0);
[02:37:34] <gigafied> but yeah, the concept is the same, gotta break all the traversing into chunks
[02:37:52] <heatxsink> gigafied: which has now made led me to completely redo the client side rendering to one of my pages, i think i'm gonna just push all of this unneccessary rendering to the server side cause i don't really have to do this client side ... i just didn't want to have to rewrite it all :-/
[02:38:54] <gigafied> sometimes it's just inevitable :/
[02:42:55] <sedavand> how do I use a string as a object property key?
[02:43:05] <sedavand> var key = "foo";
[02:43:14] <sedavand> object.key = "bar";
[02:43:17] <blackspotwiggins> obj[key]
[02:43:35] <sedavand> ok, so object[key] = "bar" then?
[02:43:40] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[02:43:46] <sedavand> thank you

[02:48:46] <TheUros> SoulRaven => i posted my own question :) .. nothing to do with your problem
[02:49:12] <SoulRaven> to bad:(
[02:49:28] <SoulRaven> seams that all the guys are on the party status :))
[02:54:41] <Whirl3d> SoulRaven, how about a working example?
[02:55:01] <heatxsink> gigafied: thanks for the feedback
[02:55:10] <gigafied> np
[02:57:10] <Whirl3d> TheUros, SoulRaven, it's not easy to troubleshoot someone elses code when you can't see it in action or see where the problem is. If you could make a "broken" but complete example on jsfiddle.net, it's a lot easier to get help
[02:57:22] <SoulRaven> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/YWzkN/1/
[02:58:06] <Whirl3d> SoulRaven, thx. what are you trying to do now?
[02:58:29] <Whirl3d> and do you need to wrap that in a document ready?
[02:58:44] <SoulRaven> when i click on some a tag, to get all the a tags that contains a tags
[02:58:56] <SoulRaven> when i click on some a tag, to get all the a tag
[02:59:23] <Whirl3d> and do what with them?
[02:59:54] <SoulRaven> to check if have any class with a default state, and remove the class
[03:00:53] <SoulRaven> i want to make a click state on the menu, and for that, i need to scan all the elements, and remove any click class and append the click class only on the element that i have clicked
[03:01:49] <Whirl3d> $("a").click(function (e) { $(this).siblings().removeClass("state"); $(this).addClass("state");});
[03:02:11] <Whirl3d> or if you want to use .on
[03:02:55] <Whirl3d> $("#leftMenuSetting").on("click", function (e) { $(this).find("a").removeClass(state); $(e.target).addClass(state);});
[03:03:06] <burg> hello. i am using slideUp and slideDown in this example: http://sandbox.mariusradvan.com/test/ , but it is not smooth at all. can you help me with a sugestion?
[03:03:44] <SoulRaven> with find('a') is not working, and with siblings i get only the a tags from that li node, not from all the nodes
[03:04:05] <Whirl3d> burg, try using .stop() before each animate call. Otherwise your animations get queued
[03:05:08] <burg> ok, let me try
[03:05:52] <TheUros> how i can set some attribute ?? .. <input value="x">  i want to change that x
[03:06:08] <ravenzz> ?val @ TheUros
[03:06:14] <burg> Whirl3d, this is not the reason. because it doesn`t work from the first time i put my mouse over the image.
[03:06:34] <burg> also is does not last 500ms, like i call slideUp, but it just pops up
[03:06:37] <SoulRaven> ('some selector').val('the value that you want');
[03:07:12] <TheUros> .val ?? .. is this fo input value only?? .. and iff i need to set title="" or something else ?
[03:07:29] <SoulRaven> ('some selector').attr('title', 'the value that you want');
[03:07:56] <SoulRaven> look on the attr method in jquery api
[03:08:12] <ravenzz> TheUros for those kind of attributes use attr()
[03:08:21] <TheUros> i'll look
[03:09:53] <burg> Whirl3d, any other idea?
[03:10:44] <SoulRaven> Whirl3d: try with toogle and define you action costume, i guess

[03:30:13] <GoSox> Whirl3d !
[03:30:43] <munichlinux> is there html5 rich text editor or something which uses contenteditable
[03:32:20] <Whirl3d> yes?
[03:32:29] <GoSox> http://www.macfixer.net/
[03:32:34] <GoSox> thats pretty much the final product
[03:32:38] <GoSox> i'm pretty happy with it
[03:32:45] <GoSox> exact the non-transparent background
[03:33:57] <GoSox> well, and aside from playing with the easing
[03:34:08] <Whirl3d> Looks great
[03:34:12] <GoSox> thanks
[03:34:16] <GoSox> and i agree
[03:35:12] <GoSox> i used to have a much lower quality animated GIF version of this, that just faded from one image to another, and it was many times larger than the simple jpg i'm using now
[03:36:34] <GoSox> i kept a very high res version of the original artwork. so once "retina" ipads and macs come around, i can use 4x resolution in the animation and you'll get amazing detail on those apple products
[03:37:23] <TCH> hi there
[03:37:26] <Whirl3d> plus animated gifs suck.
[03:37:27] <dw> hi
[03:37:52] <TCH> Cool, there is some people
[03:38:02] <dw> there is 7 billion people :)
[03:38:37] <TCH> Can annybody help me with the "Attribute Contains Selector " function ?
[03:39:08] <Whirl3d> GoSox, gimme just a minute...
[03:41:36] <TCH> I'm trying to do this     $(input[name$="objectname.attribute"]')....   I tried to write this to escape the dot :  $(input[name$="objectname\\.attribute"]')   but it seems that neither one or the other solution works for me (sorry for my english)
[03:43:59] <TCH> :(    so...   bye
[03:52:47] <Demp> is there a common reason why the ajax success method never fires?
[03:54:31] <GoSox> Whirl3d: i had stepped away, what's up?
[03:54:45] <GoSox> Demp: no success? I can't think of any time i've had that problem
[03:55:36] <Demp> it's really strange
[03:55:41] <Demp> it worked a couple of hours ago
[03:55:54] <GoSox> can you load the url manually?
[03:56:40] <DukeDrake> hmm ... will it rise an error if I try to select an opject that doesn't exist?
[03:56:44] <Demp> I checked chrome's network tab on the developer thingy. the page loaded completely
[03:57:09] <xec> DukeDrake: you mean an element? no
[03:57:19] <DukeDrake> ok, cool.
[03:57:21] <GoSox> a syntax error maybe? jQuery gets crazy with the {)({},{}{),{)(}{)},{)(,;
[03:57:33] <Demp> I'll check it again
[03:59:04] <Demp> syntax seems fine..
[03:59:27] <xec> do you get any errors in console?
[04:00:00] <Demp> nope
[04:00:21] <xec> can you see the http request
[04:01:20] <Demp> http request is ok, response status 200
[04:01:43] <Demp> response data is what it should be as well
[04:01:58] <xec> beats me, then :) is your app live somewhere?
[04:02:36] <Demp> yea but it's kind of delicate stuff.. cant have people messing with it
[04:03:49] <Demp> http://pastebin.com/xzmVwszU that's the ajax bit of the code
[04:04:43] <Demp> can you see anything wrong with it?
[04:06:38] <xec> nope
[04:06:56] <DukeDrake> hmm
[04:07:15] <DukeDrake> $('#myid').id() - is not a function ?
[04:07:32] <quicksilver> Demp: does your server side confirm the POST definitely happens?
[04:07:46] <Demp> what do you mean?
[04:07:50] <xec> DukeDrake: ...you want to return the id of an element you select by id?
[04:08:09] <DukeDrake> xec: no, I actually want to set the id =)
[04:08:17] <DukeDrake> $('#myid').id('newid') - is not a function ?
[04:08:23] <quicksilver> no it's not.
[04:08:26] <quicksilver> "attr" is a function though.
[04:08:45] <xec> .attr("id", "myid")
[04:08:49] <DukeDrake> kk
[04:08:50] <DukeDrake> thanx
[04:09:00] <quicksilver> Demp: you are posting to a PHP script. Can you PHP server confirm that that PHP script - process.php - is definitely being called
[04:09:14] <beasty_> SoulRaven: still alive ?
[04:10:56] <Demp> it is definitely being called.. I checked the network tab on chrome's dev tool and the response for that page is what it should have been. the php did what it should have done as well
[04:11:20] <quicksilver> Demp: add an error callback and see if you're getting an error.
[04:11:51] <Demp> will do
[04:11:56] <quicksilver> JSON parse failure would be one possibility
[04:12:58] <beasty_> anyone here having chrome and want to test somthing for me ?
[04:15:00] <dr0id> we don't use chrome anymore
[04:15:55] <GoSox> i upgraded to 14 GB of RAM so I could run 5 different OSes at once via Virtual Machines so I could run pages through a gauntlet of about 22 different web browsers
[04:16:12] <GoSox> so rent my computer :P
[04:16:44] <beasty_> only 14 gb ?
[04:16:57] <GoSox> yeah well its kind of expensive ram
[04:17:05] <GoSox> fully buffered etc
[04:17:09] <GoSox> whatever that means
[04:17:13] <GoSox> it means $$$ that's what it means
[04:17:17] <iivvoo> or use browserstack.com or saucelabs
[04:17:33] <xec> ?ask @ beasty_
[04:17:33] <bot-t> beasty_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:18:28] <beasty_> http://jsfiddle.net/hkCwb/7/
[04:18:35] <beasty_> why doesn't that work in chrome ?
[04:18:37] <beasty_> better ?
[04:18:37] <beasty_> p:
[04:19:24] <GoSox> i also have a question. can anyone figure out why my white boxes turn pure black for a fraction of a second when you reload this page? http://www.macfixer.net/
[04:19:42] <GoSox> its a white image on a white background, on a red background. nowhere is black in the equation
[04:19:51] <xec> beasty_: it works if you have one text field
[04:20:17] <beasty_> xec: indeed
[04:24:07] <Whirl3d> GoSox, are what about this: http://www.whirl3d.com/projects/macfixer/imagetest.html
[04:24:37] <GoSox> but how would i adapt that to fit in the limited space i have
[04:24:40] <davetarmac> I've got something I would like to animate after the $(window).scrollTop() > 500, but I keep getting a jump from the position where the element is at screen_pos 499 and when it gets to 500, there is a huge jump up by about 200 or so pixels :(
[04:24:47] <davetarmac> here is my script: http://www.pastie.org/3052004
[04:25:00] <GoSox> man you should have asked me to send you the photoshop file!
[04:25:02] <davetarmac> well, here is the but inside of the event handler
[04:25:06] <GoSox> you butchered that cropping :D
[04:25:11] <Whirl3d> I was in a hurry
[04:25:13] <Whirl3d> lol
[04:25:26] <GoSox> Whirl3d: i've tried every easing type at least 4 times now
[04:25:29] <GoSox> i just can't decide
[04:25:35] <xec> beasty_: quick answer is "no" - i do not know why it doesnt work in chrome.
[04:25:35] <Whirl3d> I had to write the entire script, process your source image and mask them all out.
[04:25:43] <xec> beasty_: long answer: http://jsfiddle.net/hkCwb/11/
[04:25:46] <Whirl3d> They work on a colored background too
[04:26:28] <GoSox> i saw someone take a jpg, and a greyscale png-24, and use the PNG as a mask for the jpg, to give the jpg transparency
[04:26:31] <GoSox> it was pretty crazy
[04:26:52] <Whirl3d> In flash I did that all the time.
[04:27:05] <GoSox> i've never worked with flash
[04:27:08] <beasty_> GoSox: thanks :)
[04:27:13] <GoSox> nor do i plan on trying
[04:27:15] <GoSox> beasty_: for?
[04:28:18] <beasty_> err
[04:28:20] <beasty_> xec: thanks
[04:28:23] <beasty_> sorry tab probs
[04:28:38] <GoSox> Whirl3d: i saw a really good transition on some site, the current photo would expand as it became transparent, revealing the photo underneath
[04:29:09] <GoSox> it was a cool effect, but it wouldn't work with my odd shaped content. you'd need images where the content was rectangular
[04:29:35] <GoSox> and individual images
[04:29:38] <GoSox> and lots of work
[04:29:55] <GoSox> i promise you i'm the only one that cares what this animation looks like, i think i should just call it DONE
[04:34:19] <GoSox> Whirl3d: i didn't use the 'back' transitions because with the way i'm using it, it actually looked kind of like a mistake, the way it went too far, then went back. and while it was too far, you could see a piece of the next frame
[04:37:29] <Demp> I've got an error with the ajax function: "SyntaxError: Unexpected token s"
[04:39:02] <Whirl3d> GoSox, I used separate images...they would have worked better with back. But the one that I made doesn't use easying. I'd probably use circular easing to make it look like the mac taskbar thing
[04:39:21] <Whirl3d> easing
[04:39:34] <GoSox> Dock
[04:39:40] <Whirl3d> yeah, that thing
[04:39:41] <Whirl3d> lol
[04:39:41] <GoSox> its a dock
[04:39:57] <GoSox> i just blurred my background pattern
[04:40:40] <GoSox> i kinda like that
[04:43:04] <GoSox> Whirl3d: so I was using a huge GIF for a while for a similar animation. But I got sick of that, plus as apple changed the default desktop pattern, 256 color became too few to render sharp images
[04:43:24] <GoSox> so what i ended up with, and what i just replaced tonight, was just a random image, picked by PHP, every time you loaded the page
[04:43:39] <GoSox> simple, effective, small since you were only loading one tiny mac image
[04:45:01] <quicksilver> Demp: your JSON is malformed then.
[04:45:05] <quicksilver> Demp: (I think)
[05:00:43] <tch> HI, is there someone here that can help me with the Attribute Contains Selector function ?
[05:02:34] <quicksilver> tch: just ask your question :)
[05:02:55] <tch> thx
[05:03:05] <tch> i'm using the selector like this :
[05:03:35] <tch> $('input[name$="value.value"]')...
[05:04:04] <tch> (value.value because my element is generated with struts (object.attribute))
[05:04:24] <tch> It semmes that I must escape the 'dot' character
[05:05:03] <tch> but $('input[name$="value\\.value"]') doesn't work
[05:05:08] <quicksilver> you shouldn't need to inside quotes
[05:05:25] <quicksilver> [name$="value.value"] should match all input elements whose name ends in value.value
[05:05:46] <quicksilver> e.g. <input name="fovalue.value">
[05:06:03] <tch> ok, I try this and tell you
[05:08:28] <jeffsmykil> Anyone know how to get all of the years to display in the jquery date picker dialog?
[05:08:39] <jeffsmykil> i can only get it to do 10
[05:11:54] <jeffsmykil> oh there it is
[05:12:46] <tch> @quicksilver : doesn't work.   I've got an  <input type="hidden" name"mybean" property="prop.value" />    and I'm trying to select this element with the "prop.value".   Once the .jsp is generated, the input becomes <input type="hidden" name="mybean.prop.value" />
[05:13:12] <tch> but the selector still doesn't work :/
[05:13:55] <quicksilver> your selector is input[name$="prop.value"] ?
[05:14:46] <tch> exactly
[05:14:59] <quicksilver> tch: works fine.
[05:15:00] <quicksilver> tch: http://jsfiddle.net/w49Mj/
[05:15:09] <quicksilver> there is nothing wrong with the selector or the dot.
[05:15:20] <quicksilver> something about your code does not match the description you've given.
[05:15:40] <quicksilver> or the problem is not where you think it is. "doesn't work" doesn't tell me much.
[05:15:45] <tch> In fact, maybe the problem is here : I try to make this :     $(input$="prop.value"]).change(function)
[05:16:15] <tch> to see if the value of my hidden input changes (and it changes !)
[05:16:45] <quicksilver> I believe the 'change' method is called when an input is changed by the user
[05:16:49] <quicksilver> not when it's changed by a script.
[05:16:57] <quicksilver> hidden values can't be changed by the user.
[05:17:17] <quicksilver> so, I imagine, .change handlers never get called on hidden elements.
[05:18:42] <tch> I think that you've got the point :/
[05:19:10] <tch> Thw anyway !
[05:19:14] <tch> *thx
[05:19:17] <Blindie> hello
[05:19:17] <GoSox> Whirl3d
[05:21:20] <Blindie> can anyonen help me make this function with jquery? http://eataround.de/
[05:28:13] <tch> @quicksilver : I take a look on the  $(:hidden)  function...
[05:29:33] <quicksilver> tch: selecting hidden items isnot a problem.
[05:29:44] <quicksilver> your original name$=prop.value will select them fine.
[05:29:56] <quicksilver> your problem is quite different, it's just that .change won't fire on hidden items.
[05:30:18] <tch> I 'm reading this http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[05:30:24] <tch> may help me
[05:30:31] <tch> *helps
[05:30:52] <quicksilver> no, it doesn't help you.
[05:30:58] <tch> ho, I see
[05:30:59] <quicksilver> you do not have a problem selectoing.
[05:31:02] <tch> your right
[05:31:03] <quicksilver> selecting is easy.
[05:31:24] <quicksilver> your problem is that the DOM 'change' event only fires when the *user* changes the field
[05:31:30] <quicksilver> not when it's changed by javascript code.
[05:31:37] <tch> ok, so I must look for hidden elements handlers
[05:31:40] <GoSox> Whirl3d: if you get this: there is a webkit image mask property in css. It only works in chrome and safari, but i use a small png to mask away the white background of my animated jpg. No other browser supports it yet, but as you can imagine, I have a higher than normal amount of webkit traffic :D
[05:31:42] <quicksilver> there are no handlers.
[05:31:52] <quicksilver> no code is fired on response to javascript code changing a value.
[05:32:08] <quicksilver> your choices are : (1) modify the code which changes the value to do somethign else instead
[05:32:26] <quicksilver> (2) monitor the value of the hidden field periodically (setInterval) or at certain significant times (just before form submit)
[05:32:35] <tch> ok, so I can try to get the Javascript function that modify my hidden input, and add in it the Jquery function
[05:35:10] <Whirl3d> GoSox, is the image mask property based on pixel sampling or is it a separate image that acts as a mask?
[05:35:58] <GoSox> it's a separate image
[05:36:09] <Whirl3d> Cool. I'll have to check that out.
[05:36:17] <GoSox> a black png with real alpha transparency
[05:36:26] <GoSox> it applies that to the jpg
[05:36:33] <GoSox> so the image total is like 100 kb
[05:36:43] <GoSox> and it looks very slick
[05:37:12] <Whirl3d> I have seen a php script that samples the upper left pixel of an image and then parses every other pixel to make a mask based on contiguous color range, but not a literal mask like that. Sound cool.
[05:37:48] <Whirl3d> But what is the advantage to just masking it in photoshop?
[05:37:59] <GoSox> it's a jpg
[05:38:00] <GoSox> you cant
[05:38:18] <Whirl3d> If you are going to make a png for a mask, make a png for your source image
[05:38:18] <GoSox> there is no such thing as transparency in jpg
[05:38:26] <GoSox> a PNG source would be huge
[05:39:31] <Whirl3d> I made each of those images you had into transparent pngs and (without compression) had at most a 63k image size
[05:39:44] <GoSox> my entire image as a jpg is 80k
[05:39:48] <GoSox> for all 10 frames
[05:40:01] <Whirl3d> Interesting.
[05:40:34] <Whirl3d> Too bad it's not supported in all browsers.
[05:40:48] <Whirl3d> Have you heard if other browsers are planning to?
[05:41:15] <GoSox> yeah the jpg is 82KB, the png mask is 20KB, the whole image as a single transparent png would be 270KB
[05:41:29] <GoSox> i assume its going to be part of CSS3 so it will be supported by all of them eventually
[05:41:31] <GoSox> except IE
[05:41:32] <Whirl3d> And is the mask a continuous tone greyscale or just bw
[05:41:57] <GoSox> my mask is black and alpha-transparency
[05:42:56] <Whirl3d> do you have 50% black pixels? 50% alpha channel pixels? or is it just 100% or 100% clear?
[05:43:15] <Whirl3d> I'm not asking that very well...
[05:43:19] <GoSox> yes it has variable-transparency
[05:43:32] <GoSox> theres a word for it and i forget what that word is
[05:43:34] <Whirl3d> Very cool
[05:43:48] <GoSox> but its not black and transparent, its transparancyscale
[05:44:49] <GoSox> my main competitor's website is SHIT compared to mine :D
[05:44:50] <GoSox> http://www.macintoshdr.com/Mac_Doctor/Home/Home.html
[05:44:56] <GoSox> and thats BEFORE you even look at his source code
[05:45:40] <dr0id> that's a cool site
[05:45:45] <GoSox> he likes to copy my site, i'm sure before long he'll just make an exact copy and change the color
[05:46:31] <GoSox> hah he makes his website with iWeb
[05:46:53] <mansoor> i'm bookmarking that site
[05:47:07] <mansoor> for when my mac gets slow again
[05:47:16] <chee> you can tell as much as that from the uri
[05:47:20] <darcy> my word…he likes his inline styles …..:-(
[05:47:25] <Whirl3d> translucency
[05:47:55] <GoSox> i think it's like 1-bit transparency vs 8-bit transparency
[05:48:17] <GoSox> PNG-24's have 8 bit, PNG-8's (with the 256 color pallete) have 1 bit
[05:48:20] <Whirl3d> most of his pngs have alpha channels anyways
[05:48:41] <GoSox> oh i thought we were just talking about transparency in generao
[05:48:45] <GoSox> general
[05:49:16] <Whirl3d> I thought you were showing me the mask feature.
[05:49:42] <GoSox> no, when i linked to his site, i was just showing you a shitty website that is a direct local competitor to me
[05:50:24] <GoSox> that, in my opinion, has a far inferior website
[05:54:23] <GoSox> and he puts paid ads all over his site. why would you put ads on such a tiny, low traffic, local website? They're googlead type ads. He probably makes $5 a month off those, and they make his site look like shit. what is he thinking
[05:54:58] <GoSox> well anyway, i wanted to go to bed by 5am, and it's now 9am

[05:58:42] <enleth> Hi there. Can anyone point me off the top of their head to a jQuery plugin that replaces form controls with MacOS-style widgets? I know, it's silly, but it's not up to me to decide.
[05:59:26] <enleth> There are no obvious non-stale Google results, the only obious one has a dead download link
[05:59:32] <enleth> *obvious
[06:00:20] <khan> do you want to change the styling?
[06:01:13] <enleth> I want the controls to look like Safari/OS X regardless of the actual browser and OS
[06:01:49] <enleth> It doesn't have to be a perfect look-and-feel match. The spec guys want shiny, that's all.
[06:02:11] <Whirl3d> try jqueryUI
[06:02:53] <enleth> Does it do standard form control styling besides the new widgets?
[06:03:04] <enleth> I mean, such a deep level of styling?
[06:06:54] <enleth> Ah, I see, the button class can restyle radiobuttons and checkboxes.
[06:07:13] <enleth> But there's no pre-made combo box handler, I guess I'll have to hack something together
[06:08:33] <enleth> Wait, there is - Autocomplete->Combobox, not quite a single function but that's all I need
[06:11:39] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: You still looking for more info on .on?
[06:12:31] <Whirl3d> Hey there. Actually, i got it worked out pretty well. Thanks for the advice earlier.
[06:13:00] <Eviltwin> No problem
[06:13:28] <khan> As a front end Developer what other languages should i learn besides html,css,Js,Jquery?
[06:14:39] <Eviltwin> khan: Well those are the ones that you'd interact with in the browser
[06:15:00] <Eviltwin> You should also be aware of JSON and its syntax probably
[06:15:01] <Eviltwin> http://json.org/
[06:15:07] <Eviltwin> Especially in this age of AJAX
[06:15:51] <xrated> khan, you should be familiar with javascript as a whole and not just jQuery. It really helps when you're writing your jQuery-based code if you have an understanding of what's happening under the hood.
[06:16:29] <khan> okay thank you
[06:16:33] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs
[06:16:34] <khan> so should i just expanding in those?
[06:16:55] <Eviltwin> Start here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[06:16:59] <Eviltwin> At whatever level you think you're at
[06:17:14] <Eviltwin> And try to really understand everything up through at least some of the advanced stuff
[06:17:55] <Eviltwin> jQuery doesn't have functions for things that are already easy to do in JavaScript
[06:18:01] <Eviltwin> So it's important that you know JavaScript
[06:18:08] <xec> to be fair, he did list js before jquery in his list ;)
[06:18:20] <xrated> oh, missed that
[06:18:22] <xrated> my bad
[06:18:35] <khan> thank you
[06:18:48] <khan> i was just wondering if i should slowly start expanding into differnt langauges
[06:18:52] <Eviltwin> Right, I'm just stressing how much more important it is to understand JavaScript than jQuery
[06:19:25] <khan> because i am having such a hard time looking for a job  everyone is asking for asp or php/mysql
[06:20:00] <daveluke> hi, i'm having an issue. when i make do $('#id') it doesn't find the dom element, even though it is clearly there in the source
[06:20:03] <xrated> Are you looking for specifically front-end developer jobs or just web developer job
[06:20:05] <Eviltwin> khan: It's prety amazing what all can be done using just HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a moder browser
[06:20:26] <Eviltwin> daveluke: see ?demo
[06:20:30] <Eviltwin> Err
[06:20:31] <Eviltwin> Bot's gone
[06:20:37] <xrated> daveluke, can you fiddle that?
[06:20:40] <khan> i am looking for both  at indeed.com and dice.com
[06:20:45] <daveluke> fiddle?
[06:20:45] <Eviltwin> daveluke: Okay, can you make a demo of your problem at jsFiddle.net
[06:20:48] <xec> daveluke: you are probably trying to select it before it exists in the DOM
[06:21:12] <xec> daveluke: is your script at the end of your document, or inside a document ready event?
[06:21:13] <Eviltwin> Or has done something like <div id="#foo"></div> instead of <div id="foo"></div>
[06:21:16] <daveluke> xec, the trigger is a onchange...
[06:21:21] <Eviltwin> I've even done that once or twice
[06:21:28] <Eviltwin> xec: I think he said it's there in the source
[06:21:55] <xec> Eviltwin: i assume that means the element he's trying to select
[06:22:38] <Eviltwin> daveluke: How do you know it doesn't find the element?
[06:22:41] <xec> daveluke: the trigger?
[06:23:05] <xec> daveluke: try to replicate your issue at www.jsfiddle.net
[06:23:37] <b0ot> I'm trying to make a configuration page with jquery, where based on an xml file the page is generated, and users drag and drop things around to "configure the page". I can figure out the draging/droping section, but the reading from an xml file and writing to the xml file is the part I could use some suggestions with. Currently I read everything from the XML file into one large class, but that doesn't really make sense as I can access it directly through
[06:23:37] <b0ot> Xpath
[06:23:42] <daveluke> Eviltwin, I have a series of these forms created by a loop in PHP... all of them work except the first one.. I try to alert the "action" attribute of the form and it comes back undefined
[06:24:02] <Eviltwin> Like $("#id").action ?
[06:24:48] <daveluke> attr('action')
[06:24:59] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Did you look at http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_parser.asp
[06:25:12] <Eviltwin> It lets you work with it as a DOM
[06:25:59] <daveluke> works in jsfiddle.net
[06:26:07] <daveluke> when i paste the source
[06:26:35] <Eviltwin> Then you must be doing something wrong somewhere else
[06:26:41] <Eviltwin> Are you using a $(document).ready ?
[06:27:19] <daveluke> Eviltwin, yes
[06:27:37] <daveluke> it's weird because only the first form created in the loop is broken
[06:27:55] <mazzachre> I am making a "style designer" thingie, for an app I have made. So far I have alot of basic stuff, like colors and such. And the app is in use, so it works and the customer likes it. However the customer (and others that are potential) are asking for stuff like being able to change the font in different parts of the app... So I made a quick hack where I just made a select with different font values for css and some front text (like "Times big, Times big
[06:27:55] <mazzachre> bold" etc. as frontend for "bold 3em Times New Roman,times,serif" etc... But that is not really what they want ofcause... What to do? It is not really a trivial task to make an advanced font selector (Think MS word style here...) and I have not found one. So I have tried to think my way around how to make one for jqueryui (Which I use for the rest of the admin app) But I am kind of stuck...
[06:28:59] <daveluke> i wonder if the jquery being used is old
[06:29:10] <daveluke> nope :(
[06:29:17] <xec> daveluke: are you getting any errors on console?
[06:29:26] <xec> s/on/in
[06:29:28] <Rotham> hey
[06:29:43] <daveluke> xec, no error
[06:29:50] <mazzachre> I will run the widget against an input element, hide it, and update it in the background when the different parts of the selector values change (Not sure how to accomplish that, my few tries with custom events have lead me nowhere...)
[06:29:53] <Rotham> whats the easiest way to handle animations for a slider that only trigger when a button is pressed?
[06:31:14] <xec> mazzachre: i'm sorry, this isn't a great forum for brainstorming, maybe if you could boil it down to a smaller issue
[06:31:19] <mazzachre> Also, I am considering instead of adding a number of input elements for the different parts of the font selection directly where the input element was, making the input element into a button (possibly style the button with the selected font as "wysiwyg") and let the button open a dialog where you select options... That is possibly nicer...
[06:31:27] <daveluke> is there any common reason why a dom wouldn't be correctly selected by id?
[06:31:43] <Eviltwin> daveluke: If more than one element has that ID
[06:31:53] <Eviltwin> Or if it has been removed from the DOM
[06:31:54] <mazzachre> xec: Sorry
[06:32:47] <mazzachre> Does some secret font selector widget exist that does all this already? That I just can't find. Or should I build one?
[06:33:06] <Eviltwin> If it was a secret, would we know about it?
[06:33:39] <mazzachre> If someone knows one :) Secret as in secret for me :D
[06:34:05] <Eviltwin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5965091/jquery-font-selector-showhide-with-focus ?
[06:34:17] <xec> mazzachre: could you show us what you have so far, and what sort of improvement you're after?
[06:36:01] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/3cEey/9/ where are my achor elements going?
[06:36:12] <Eviltwin> To a better place
[06:36:23] <daveluke> ok, i inspected the dom with chrome's dev thing... the form is NOT there!!!
[06:36:35] <daveluke> just for the first one though
[06:36:46] <Eviltwin> Then you removed it somewhere
[06:37:38] <daveluke> thru js?
[06:37:49] <xec> validate the html, maybe some small error you overlooked
[06:37:58] <Eviltwin> daveluke: Probably
[06:38:06] <Eviltwin> If they're in the source and not the DOM, then yes, absolutely
[06:38:38] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Are you trying to add the a tag after the input?
[06:39:05] <Whirl3d> Yeah, just a simple anchor element that I can make toggle the details div
[06:39:18] <Eviltwin> Then you have just been burned by the subtle difference between .after and .insertAfter
[06:39:36] <Whirl3d> aha. Thanks. I'll read up on them.
[06:39:42] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/3cEey/10/
[06:40:56] <Eviltwin> Also, while it doesn't save chars or anything, I find this syntax for creating elements more readable: http://jsfiddle.net/3cEey/12/
[06:45:29] <Whirl3d> Never seen that before. it is more readable.
[06:45:50] <Eviltwin> Its somewhere on this page: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/

[06:46:23] <webroasters> hi guys. I have a class, that has links inside of it (two to be exact). Without going into much detail, I want to make all links within that class disappear. how do i do that?
[06:47:25] <webroasters> preferably using the hide() method
[06:47:41] <Eviltwin> $(".class a").hide() ?
[06:47:50] <webroasters> lol, what a dummy i am
[06:47:55] <Eviltwin> What did you think?
[06:48:40] <djnewbie> hi all, anyone know how to set focus to an input element after a hidden modal window is displayed? (is loaded via modaltrigger)
[06:48:42] <webroasters> i dont know what i was thinking
[06:48:49] <webroasters> i thought was much harder for some reason
[06:48:53] <bennymack> hey everybody! I'm failing at jquery. I can't seem to get :gt() or slice() to work.
[06:51:15] <bennymack> http://racerup.com:5002/events the TDs can have multiple spans which I hide all but the first one on page load. Then I'd like to be able to toggle showing/hiding them when the TR is clicked. Keep in mind this is very rough, prototype code at this point :)
[06:53:50] <bennymack> nm. I think I've found the error of my ways.
[06:54:08] <Eviltwin> $(this).children().gt(0).hide();
[06:54:09] <Eviltwin> BTW
[06:54:12] <Eviltwin> No need for the .each
[06:55:28] <timmywil> gt is not a method
[06:55:51] <timmywil> but no need for that either
[06:56:06] <Eviltwin> Sorry, yeah, .slide
[06:56:10] <Eviltwin> :gt is only the selector
[06:56:14] <Eviltwin> .slice*
[06:56:24] <Eviltwin> timmywil: He wants to skip the first element
[06:56:40] <timmywil> ah, yea that would work
[06:56:59] <timmywil> but .slice(1) yea?
[06:58:08] <djnewbie> hi all, anyone know how to set focus to an input element after a hidden modal window is displayed? (is loaded via modaltrigger)
[06:58:19] <sunscreen> hey little tip for you all when your laying out your side .. in your css add... * { border 1px dashed; }
[06:58:28] <sunscreen> side.site
[06:58:42] <Eviltwin> timmywil: Yes
[06:59:01] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: Thanks...
[06:59:13] <timmywil> djnewbie: call .focus() in the callback of the modal animation.  You may need to add that to the bottom of the stack with a setTimeout(function() { $elem.focus() }, 0);
[06:59:41] <sunscreen> i discovered it usefulness totally by accident
[07:01:11] <niftylettuce_> what would be the best/fastest way to take an array of 8 Strings and splice it into 4 arrays, which 2 Strings in each

[07:01:56] <ari5av> hi folks.  I have a <select> element that, based on some condition, I wish to change the value of.  assume two <option>s inside it with values "one" and "two".  should I use $('#my_select').val("one") or is there a better way to do it?
[07:02:34] <ari5av> it should explicitly change which option is selected.
[07:02:40] <Jee5us_work> Hi! I am trying to construct and array, what gets it's keys from the nametag input and values from the input. The problem is, that it doesn't let me set a key dynamically ie - $(this).attr('name')
[07:03:30] <Eviltwin> niftylettuce_: var in = ..., out = []; for(var i = 0; i < in.length; i += 2) { out.push(in.slice(i,i+2)) } ?
[07:04:06] <Eviltwin> ari5av: That should work fine
[07:04:28] <Eviltwin> Jee5us_work: What?
[07:05:23] <Jee5us_work> Eviltwin - I am pushing values into array, but it doesn't let me create dynamic keys from values. Like $object.push({ $(this).attr('name') : $(this).attr('value') })
[07:05:28] <ari5av> Eviltwin: thanks.  just making sure there wasn't already some function that sets options in a select, which might be more optimized.
[07:06:08] <Eviltwin> Jee5us_work: Oh, that won't work, you'll have to construct it another way
[07:06:09] <ari5av> Jee5us_work: javascript doesn't work like that.  array keys are static values, I believe
[07:06:28] <Eviltwin> Jee5us_work: var addition = {}; addition[$(this).attr('name')] = $(this).attr('value'); $object.push(addition);
[07:07:39] <mazzachre> I have used that same code in some of my tries.. I have only made some tests on jsfiddle, and none of them really any good.
[07:08:12] <ari5av> Eviltwin: when I set the value of that select using .val(), does it trigger a change event on the select?
[07:08:20] <Jee5us_work> Eviltwin - thanks
[07:09:03] <mixxit> hey can anyone tell me how i can use .load('http://url') so my <img> dont flicker onto screen from the url
[07:09:33] <Eviltwin> ari5av: I don't recall but if it doesn't, you can manually trigger using .change()
[07:09:39] <sunscreen> ari5av, you need to use 'on' i think
[07:10:31] <ari5av> sweet, thanks.  I'll give it a whirl
[07:10:57] <sunscreen> i have a little problem that my self i dynamically load some content where i have buttons and then they inject there code for $('#bla').on('click',function.. etc);  but its like there a moment when the handler is not registered
[07:11:34] <Whirl3d> bind the on event to the parent element of the items you are adding.
[07:12:25] <djnewbie> timmywil: not sure how to get in the callback of the modal animation... (to get the focus on a field in the modal window when displayed) ?
[07:12:25] <djnewbie> maybe this clarifies where i'm at? http://dpaste.com/676281/
[07:12:40] <ari5av> you can chain it, right?  like $('#my_select').val('foo').change();
[07:12:54] <Eviltwin> ari5av: Yup
[07:12:57] <ari5av> nice.
[07:13:01] <ari5av> I <3 jquery
[07:13:10] <ari5av> every time I use it for something I learn something new
[07:13:42] <timmywil> djnewbie: I'd be shocked if the plugin you are using does not have an option for an open callback
[07:21:52] <snowfox> hey all. If I want to add two elements on the page (both are numbers with decimals) how would I go about that?
[07:23:11] <y3di> so my getJSON() callback function won't run if it receives empty JSON, '[]', is there any way around this? I need the callback function to run even when the json response is empty
[07:23:28] <xec> snowfox: do you mean to increment already existing numbers in html elements? or do you have a number in javascript you would like to display on a page?

[07:24:48] <snowfox> this commerce module I am using breaks tax down by Product and Shipping, I want to merge the two
[07:25:13] <xec> snowfox: assuming you know how to select, you can get contents of an element with .html() and create numbers with parseInt()

[07:56:19] <xec> well
[07:56:26] <xec> not entirely
[07:56:30] <xec> so, no
[07:56:32] <snowfox> Right
[07:56:42] <midori_> can any help me?
[07:56:52] <midori_> how to dynamically measure the width of the div using .width?
[07:57:41] <snowfox> This only occurs on 2 of 100s of pages. Is there anything else I should bake in?
[07:57:51] <snowfox> I typically am passing things through events

[07:57:56] <xec> midori_: $("element").width() <-- ?
[07:58:48] <walid> i tried using ustream.tv, and including an iframe, but i still get an 'unsafe' warning

[08:00:32] <midori_> xec If I change the window size measurement is not
[08:00:56] <xec> midori_: aha!
[08:01:21] <xec> midori_: you would need to listen to window resize event, whatever its called, and update the value
[08:02:10] <xec> midori_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/599288/cross-browser-window-resize-event-javascript-jquery
[08:02:35] <snowfox> xec that will do it. Thans!
[08:02:36] <snowfox> thanks
[08:05:11] <abgrilo> how can I discover which handlers are attached to an element?
[08:10:40] <surfdue> I am doing an append to a container adding a child div, I need to then load content into that child. Putting $('#child-1').load() for example right under the append tries to load without having the content
[08:10:41] <surfdue> what can I do?
[08:12:06] <surfdue> I tried using git, but I am grabbing contents from a file that contains <?php ?> and it appears jquery is adding <!-- --> to the get return
[08:12:57] <midori_> xec thanks!
[08:15:02] <surfdue> xec: your in here too? :)
[08:15:10] <surfdue> i even tried contentType = html
[08:15:15] * xec waves
[08:15:22] <surfdue> i mean datatype
[08:15:38] <surfdue> xec: $.ajax is returning my php file commented out.
[08:15:42] <surfdue> how can I prevent this?
[08:16:24] <xec> i doubt $.ajax() is doing that, what do you get if you visit the url directly?
[08:16:31] <surfdue> the plain code
[08:16:43] <surfdue> the server could be trying to execute it i guess
[08:16:56] <surfdue> erg
[08:16:59] <surfdue> how do i prevent this!!
[08:16:59] <surfdue> lol
[08:19:14] <surfdue> xec: yet again, you were correct header("Content-type: text/plain"); fixed it...
[08:19:18] * surfdue searches for coffee
[08:20:33] <surfdue> xec: actually I spoke to soon.. On the plain page i have it visible as plain text now, however the $.get seems to be commenting it out still, is this possible?
[08:20:49] <xec> is your site live somewhere?
[08:21:09] <surfdue> xec:  yes, may I pm it to you?
[08:21:13] <xec> sure
[08:21:13] <surfdue> there is a user/pass
[08:22:56] <seoshark> if i have a standard horizontal navigation and when one item is "clicked" i want a "box" to appear, like a login box... should i just create a div and position it where it WOULD "appear", and then just display:none; it and just use a jquery trigger to animate it, or is there a better method?
[08:24:07] <snowfox> seoshark that is what I would do
[08:24:27] <snowfox> seoshark and be sure to set it to display:none in the js vs css
[08:24:40] <snowfox> else js disabled folk are sol
[08:25:30] <seoshark> snow0x2d0: i should display:none it in CSS otherwise the login box will appear and be weird lol
[08:25:37] <seoshark> oops
[08:25:43] <seoshark> snowfox: i should display:none it in CSS otherwise the login box will appear and be weird lol
[08:25:52] <snowfox> err...no, I disagree
[08:26:02] <snowfox> in the js, set it to .hide()
[08:26:04] <seoshark> snowfox: why not do a noscript in the body of the site
[08:26:16] <seoshark> snowfox: https://sbabusinessloans.com/lenders.html
[08:26:34] <seoshark> snowfox: so when u click "lenders" or when i put a "login" button up there itll show, but if its no script a login box will show where it says u need to be logged in
[08:26:51] <seoshark> snowfox: otherwise, how are they gonna log in?
[08:27:22] <snowfox> seoshark, what I am saying is...by default, if no js is enabled, it shows.
[08:27:44] <snowfox> if js is enabled you hide it using .hide()
[08:28:07] <snowfox> but, if you code in your CSS display:none how would a js-disabled person log?
[08:28:24] <snowfox> anyway, there you have options. But, I think you are on the right track
[08:28:41] <seoshark> snowfox: but i mean, if i do <noscript></noscript> in the body, won't it show the other login box for non-js ?
[08:29:14] <snowfox> Hmm, not sure about that method. I wouldn't do it that way
[08:32:40] <seoshark> snowfox im just thinkin then i need to move the login box otherwise itll be goofy
[08:33:02] <snowfox> Hmm, I don't follow
[08:34:07] <walid> what is the best way to include a webcam on my page?
[08:34:08] <walid> i tried using ustream.tv, and including an iframe, but i still get an 'unsafe' warning
[08:36:17] <monk12> hello all, just curious... is there a place that explains how the jquery library is built? i just read a few books on javascript, with emphasis on prototyping/OO etc and now ready to understand how it works... I see $ is a function since js allows it... and jquery decides what to do based on if its passed a DOMelement, string or function (shortcut for $(document).ready();)... i just wanted a step by step article/blog on how its built.
[08:37:21] <monk12> like a lil' more detail on whats going on in '	jQuery = window.jQuery = window.$ = function( selector, context ) { return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context ); },
[08:37:21] <monk12> '
[08:37:25] <snowfox> soeshark this is what I was suggesting
[08:37:25] <snowfox> http://jsfiddle.net/M4y6S/
[08:37:34] <snowfox> seoshark rather
[08:41:28] <yan_nick> hey guys
[08:42:14] <Eviltwin> monk12: Not sure there's a step-by-step article on how it was built
[08:42:29] <Eviltwin> monk12: I just ended up digesting the source and understanding it
[08:44:55] <monk12> darn. i was more interested in just the meat. like why jQuery.prototype is assigned to an object with all these properties/functions. does assigning it to the prototype do something special, like will some other object inherit jQuery's prototype?
[08:48:08] <Eviltwin> I believe that's to allow for new jQuery("body")
[08:48:23] <wathek> Hi everybody
[08:48:41] <xrated> Hello
[08:49:26] <wathek> I got a problem I'm using $('.myclass').click(function(....){}); but when I use jquery to append new element with the class myclass it's not linked to the function onclick
[08:49:45] <adoven> wathek: you need to use the .live function
[08:49:47] <xrated> what version of jQuery are you using?
[08:49:47] <Eviltwin> Do you know what $('.myclass') does?
[08:49:52] <wathek> adoven, ah !
[08:49:59] <adoven> e.g. $('.myclass').live('click', function () ...
[08:50:00] <Eviltwin> adoven, wathek: No, never use .live
[08:50:01] <Eviltwin> Ever
[08:50:02] <Eviltwin> For any reason
[08:50:12] <adoven> well you could bind it again when you add the element
[08:50:13] <Eviltwin> You can use .delegate or .on
[08:50:14] <xrated> If you're using the newest version of jQuery use .on a
[08:50:18] <Eviltwin> But don't use .live
[08:50:19] <adoven> ah
[08:50:32] <adoven> is .live deprecated or just bad performance?
[08:50:36] <Eviltwin> $(document).on("click", ".myclass", function() { })
[08:50:37] <xrated> Both IIRC
[08:50:37] <Anime> deprecated, use .on now
[08:50:38] <Eviltwin> adoven: Both
[08:50:40] <adoven> ah ok
[08:50:44] <adoven> thanks for the info didnt know that
[08:50:54] <wathek> thank you guys
[08:50:57] <wathek> I'm trying it
[08:51:07] * adoven goes to change .live code i had
[08:51:26] <xrated> adoven, if you read the releases notes/blog articles of jQuery versions it mentions those things (.live being bad)
[08:52:27] <Eviltwin> Also the deprecation is mentioned on http://api.jquery.com/live/
[08:53:05] <xrated> I think they should make the deprecation notice more prominent
[08:53:12] <WeezzZ> Hi everyone
[08:53:25] <Eviltwin> xrated: Agreed
[08:53:27] <adoven> i see it now, i had learned to use it back when it was first introduced and don't always keep up with release notes etc
[08:53:50] <yan_nick> hey guys i want to hide login block content when you're clicking into the body http://jsfiddle.net/GVjhg/
[08:53:53] <yan_nick> how can i do that?
[08:54:05] <xrated> adoven, I find it useless to suscribe to something like Javascript Weekly and actually read it. They'll normally link to things like the blog article of new jQuery versions.
[08:54:06] <xrated> etc
[08:54:13] <wtfizzle> Wasn't .live() deprecated a pretty long time ago?
[08:54:22] <Eviltwin> Yes
[08:54:32] <WeezzZ> I was asking how is it possible to get absolute xpath on event.target element. It seems that jquery does not support such a functionnilty, is it true ?
[08:54:37] <wathek> I'm getting Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[08:54:51] <xrated> wathek, what version of jQuery are you using
[08:54:53] <Eviltwin> wathek: Are you using jQuery 1.7 or later?
[08:54:53] <wathek> when I did $(document).on('click', 'myclasses', function
[08:55:11] <wathek> 1.6.4
[08:55:13] <Eviltwin> Use $(document).delegate('.myclass', 'click', function(){...}) instead
[08:55:16] <xrated> use delegate
[08:55:19] <wtfizzle> Yea, go with delegate then
[08:55:36] <wtfizzle> Is .on() supposed to replace .delegate() in 1.7?
[08:55:36] <wathek> ok
[08:55:56] <Eviltwin> wathek: .on "replaces" .bind, .live, and .delegate
[08:56:04] <Eviltwin> It supports the functionality for all three
[08:56:11] <wathek> do I need to add $(document).delegate
[08:56:17] <Eviltwin> With simple and short syntax
[08:56:19] <wathek> under $(document).ready ?
[08:56:26] <Eviltwin> Don't have to, no
[08:56:28] <wathek> ok
[08:56:31] <wathek> thanks
[08:56:52] <Eviltwin> And that was meant for wtfizzle
[08:56:54] <Eviltwin> About the replacement
[08:57:06] <Eviltwin> It's not that you can't or shouldn't use .bind or .delegate any more
[08:57:19] <Eviltwin> It's just that .on is shorter to type and recommended as .bind and .delegate are just going to call .on anyway
[08:57:26] <Eviltwin> So it's faster to use .on
[08:59:02] <wtfizzle> I assume this won't impact the shorthand notations (ie. .click())
[08:59:13] <xrated> No
[08:59:17] <wathek> thank you guys
[08:59:18] <wathek> ;)
[08:59:21] <yan_nick> anybody know how to close the "popup" when clicking outside the block? http://jsfiddle.net/GVjhg/
[08:59:28] <Eviltwin> wtfizzle: The only thing that's deprecated is .live
[08:59:35] <Eviltwin> wtfizzle: Everything else is still fine to use
[08:59:59] <monk12> Eviltwin, the 1st answer here seems to be a decent take on what i wanted to know: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4083351/what-does-jquery-fn-mean
[09:00:02] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Is that bright green thing the popup?
[09:00:17] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: yeah
[09:00:23] <Eviltwin> monk12: Oh, I assumed you wanted to know in more detail
[09:00:28] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: (updated fiddle) http://jsfiddle.net/GVjhg/1/
[09:00:49] <monk12> I could... but thats a good jist of the first thing i wanted to know.
[09:01:07] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Are you actually using jQuery 1.3.2?
[09:01:25] <Eviltwin> monk12: There's a lot going on inside jQuery
[09:01:33] <Eviltwin> Data getting passed all over the place
[09:01:34] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: yes
[09:01:38] <Eviltwin> For the sake of abstraction
[09:01:40] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Why?
[09:02:11] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: because i cannot update cause of other plugins which supports 1.3.2. onl
[09:02:12] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: because i cannot update cause of other plugins which supports 1.3.2. only
[09:02:26] <Eviltwin> What plugins?
[09:02:28] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: but can we focus the problem and not the version? shouldn't be so different or?
[09:02:32] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: drupal modules :)
[09:02:42] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: "shouldn't be so different"
[09:02:46] <Eviltwin> That is absolutely not the case
[09:02:51] <Eviltwin> This is a one-line fix in jQuery 1.7
[09:02:56] <Eviltwin> Not even close here
[09:03:04] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: can you tell me the fix?
[09:03:17] <Eviltwin> Well I'm trying to figure out how with this limited toolset
[09:04:33] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: i will see how this can be done in 1.3.2 okay?
[09:04:56] <mukamike> Hello
[09:05:33] <xrated> Hello
[09:05:41] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: http://jsfiddle.net/GVjhg/2/
[09:06:05] <mukamike> I am having trouble spotting a white 1px border appering right on the top of the site, inside the bar (on its top), im using Firefox and the url is this one: http://mr.vicetto.com
[09:06:13] <mukamike> appearing
[09:09:27] <mukamike> im not sure if it comes from the jquery or css..
[09:10:38] <seoshark> hmm
[09:10:48] <seoshark> mukamike where is it
[09:10:58] <seoshark> oh FF
[09:11:06] <mukamike> at the top of the page, inside the bar
[09:11:10] <mukamike> on its top
[09:11:29] <mukamike> FFF 1px bar magically appears
[09:11:31] <mukamike> :D
[09:11:32] <Eviltwin> Probably doesn't come from jQuery...
[09:12:14] <apan> How slow is the filters in the delegate/on functions? How slow/bad is this $("#list").on('click', 'li>ul>li', function(){}) realy?
[09:12:50] <Eviltwin> apan: Well $("li > ul > li") is slow, slower than $("li") or $("li li") would be
[09:12:58] <Eviltwin> Pretty much every operation makes the selector slower to process
[09:13:04] <Eviltwin> But with delegate
[09:13:14] <wathek> is there a ready to use function in jquery that shows a full page shadow layer that indicates that the page is loading ?
[09:13:15] <Eviltwin> What happens is it only checks to see if the event target matches the selector
[09:13:28] <Eviltwin> So only looking at one element and seeing if it fits the selector
[09:13:30] <xrated> wathek, no.
[09:13:39] <Eviltwin> Which means it's pretty fast regardless of the complexity
[09:13:44] <mukamike> Thank you evil
[09:13:54] <apan> Eviltwin, okej, but it will check for every click
[09:14:06] <Eviltwin> Every click inside #list
[09:14:13] <Eviltwin> Which is the reason you want to bind it as tightly as possible
[09:14:14] <mukamike> i dont see any property in the css like that. thats whats driving me insane
[09:14:32] <Eviltwin> apan: It's not really an issue unless you're binding to something like mousemove
[09:14:40] <Eviltwin> Where events are firing many times per second
[09:15:04] <apan> eviltwin, in this case its about 20 lists with 100 items each
[09:15:19] <Eviltwin> But how many times do you expect the user to click?
[09:15:22] <Eviltwin> Or how many times per second
[09:15:25] <apan> so the parsing of the dom will not be nice
[09:15:46] <Eviltwin> Running $("#list").on('click', 'li>ul>li', function(){}) looks up exactly one element and binds exactly one event listener
[09:15:49] <Eviltwin> So it's pretty fast
[09:16:06] <Eviltwin> Then the selector matching / calling of your function only happens on clicks inside #list
[09:16:17] <Eviltwin> Really not expensive at all
[09:16:58] <danzik17> your event handler is more important in any case - that's generally where you're gonna be slow, not in the selector
[09:17:31] <Eviltwin> I think his concern was about the overhead of the delegate
[09:17:39] <Eviltwin> Which is really small
[09:17:39] <apan> would it be better to check in the function if the clicked element is a candidate, e.g $("#list").on('click', 'li', function(){ if($(this).data('id'))... }) l
[09:17:44] <Eviltwin> In fact, I recall reading a statistic
[09:17:53] <Eviltwin> That if you're binding to more than three elements
[09:17:57] <Eviltwin> And it could be done as a delegate instead
[09:18:02] <Eviltwin> That the delegate will basically be univerally faster
[09:18:14] <danzik17> apan: no.  don't prematurely attempt to optimize ( and in fact that's slower anyway with the additional call to .data )
[09:18:35] <klafka> what's 'li>ul>li' mean in that?
[09:18:36] <Eviltwin> apan: Just let the selector do its work
[09:18:50] <Eviltwin> Selectors can be slow if you're searching the entire document for things that match
[09:18:54] <Eviltwin> And that's not what on/delegate is doing
[09:19:04] <Eviltwin> It's only checking if the event target would match that selector
[09:19:07] <andrew9183> how slow is slow though? for a normal site it seems to be pretty quick
[09:19:11] <Eviltwin> Takes very little time
[09:19:12] <andrew9183> have you ever had to go an optimize css ?
[09:19:17] <andrew9183> s/an/and
[09:19:22] <ravenzz> 200ms i guess
[09:19:26] <apan> ah, cool, thanx
[09:19:27] <jessedijkstra> andrew9183: actually, yeah ^^
[09:19:27] <Eviltwin> klafka: an LI with parent UL with parent LI
[09:19:33] <klafka> aah
[09:19:52] <ravenzz> sorry 600
[09:20:07] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: The speed is more of a concern with the non-browser-supported selectors
[09:20:32] <walid> i tried using ustream.tv, and including an iframe, but i still get an 'unsafe' warning
[09:20:35] <walid> what is the best way to include a webcam on my page?
[09:20:36] <Eviltwin> Most modern browsers have support for querySelectorAll
[09:20:49] <Eviltwin> But on the ones that don't and for the things querySelectorAll doesn't support
[09:20:56] <Eviltwin> You need to process it in JavaScript
[09:21:00] <andrew9183> cross domain iframes always have warnings, no ?
[09:21:09] <Eviltwin> By building a collection of the candidates and checking if they match and filtering it down
[09:21:10] <xrated> IIRC sometimes querySelectorAll doesn't return the correct items either.
[09:21:15] <Eviltwin> Which is a slow process
[09:21:30] <jessedijkstra> Eviltwin: isn't it the same for Class selectors? Heard those were quite slow in some browsers because of the lack of getElementByClass
[09:22:40] <Eviltwin> jessedijkstra: Usually class works okay but, yeah, in some older browsers it doesn't
[09:22:58] <apan> but should the 'li li' be used insted of 'li>ul>li'
[09:23:01] <Eviltwin> It's name that's usualyl the problem
[09:23:07] <Eviltwin> apan: Those mean different things
[09:23:18] <apan> yeah, i know, but both works
[09:23:22] <apan> in this context
[09:23:23] <Eviltwin> Totally depends
[09:23:29] <Eviltwin> Oh
[09:23:31] <andrew9183> is specificity faster ?
[09:23:50] <Eviltwin> Reducing the number of (forgetting the word we'll call them...) chunks in a selector
[09:23:53] <Eviltwin> Speeds ot up
[09:23:54] <Eviltwin> it up
[09:23:57] <andrew9183> like is it better to do 'div ul li p span' or just 'span.foo'
[09:23:57] <Eviltwin> But I'm telling you
[09:24:04] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: can i just copy the closest function to 1.3.2 jquery?
[09:24:11] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: No, much better to do span.foo if it means the same thing
[09:24:15] <jessedijkstra> andrew9183: it's better to do .foo right
[09:24:16] <jessedijkstra> ?
[09:24:33] <Eviltwin> apan: But I'm telling you that in this case
[09:24:36] <Eviltwin> It really doesn't matter
[09:24:46] <Eviltwin> You could put the most complicated selector you can think of in there
[09:24:51] <Eviltwin> And I bet you still won't be able to tell the difference
[09:24:58] <Eviltwin> It's only testing ONE element against it
[09:25:28] <apan> ok, but the testing will actually be parsing the dom?
[09:25:43] <Eviltwin> Hmm?
[09:25:51] <Eviltwin> The DOM was parsed at DOM ready
[09:25:59] <Eviltwin> And it is and forever will be parsed since then
[09:30:50] <Eviltwin> You should be conservative with selectors when they're being tested against a lot of elements
[09:31:00] <Eviltwin> i.e. every element in the whole doucment
[09:31:23] <Eviltwin> But when it's being tested against a single element, you would have to work hard to make it noticeably slow to check
[09:32:10] <Blazento> is it possible to fetch a javascript via ajax and put it in the head of my current document?
[09:33:08] <Eviltwin> Is there a reason you want to fetch it via AJAX?
[09:33:32] <walid> i tried using ustream.tv, and including an iframe, but i still get an 'unsafe' warning
[09:33:34] <walid> what is the best way to include a webcam on my page?
[09:33:44] <Eviltwin> Blazento: Actually, regardless see ?.getScript
[09:33:48] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[09:34:35] <Blazento> Eviltwin, not the best reason. I'm using backbone js, which has js templates... Each template should be its own file, but for hackish reasons i need to load them all in 1 file and share them amongst different files
[09:36:29] <danzik17> Blazento: should probably look at something like RequireJS
[09:46:10] <Lifesf> Hi; i'm looking all over the net for this; if anyone can forward me to the best suggestion it'd be nice! I have some forms created with php, i would though like to send send using jquery not to mess up my present structure; also for 'edit'... in other words some fields would gather their editable information from mysql before being re-submitted
[09:48:51] <Lifesf> anyone know anything close?
[09:50:22] <Rushing> ?ajaxForm @ Lifesf
[09:50:26] <hajhouse> Lifesf: i don't know anything specific, but it sounds like you are looking for an AJAX system
[09:50:48] <Rushing> Lifesf: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[09:54:39] <Lifesf> I'll try that,.. but before i get too into all of that (which actually seems like the clearest so far from what i've seen :D thanks); what i have not been able to find at all is how to re-populate a form from mysql data... ie: user information profile edit page: the page would already populate the name date etc into fields that would in the end be re-submitted
[09:54:47] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to query/js and wonder how to solve this problem: i have a  function which switches when ctrl is pressed. and a position of a element is switched between both, on the first ctrl press i append a class to the body, in the class i have css3 transitions. but the class must be removed after ctrl is pressed the second time, the problem: when i remove the class in the first if clause, there is no css transition anymore.  is there a way
[09:54:47] <mightym> to say "function done -> removeClass() ?
[09:54:49] <mightym> http://www.pastie.org/3053294
[09:55:06] <Lifesf> unless what i want to do is simply reload the page from a jquery function all together?
[09:55:08] <coppa> hello guys
[09:55:44] <awolfey> I need to insert a closing div tag, but there doesn't seem to be a way to insert an orphan. Can anyone suggest a way around that?
[09:55:45] <coppa> it seems that $(window).on doesn't work on ie
[09:55:56] <coppa> anyone faced this issue ?
[09:57:15] <Lifesf> i already have all these forms ready in php, so i'm guessing the simplest method would be to just call the page back up from jquery... thanks!
[10:01:27] <jeffsmykil> anyone have experience with tablesorter?

[10:19:32] <beebles_> in need of help with the jquery cycle plugin
[10:19:39] <beebles_> i need to know how it works...kinda
[10:20:29] <beebles_> im generating images with php and echoing them into html tags in a loop, and hoping they are formated by the cycle plugin within the targeted Div
[10:20:34] <beebles_> but it doesnt seem to work..
[10:24:18] <NoiseEee> offer it more money
[10:24:32] <NoiseEee> also, 'hoping' only goes so far in programming

[10:26:35] <myzf> hi, i load a external site and show it with jquery-ui in a dialog -> $("#example").load("mysite.html"), but what is to do when my external sites are dynamic like a list of members
[10:26:55] <astropirate> mytoz, what do youu mean dynamic?
[10:28:11] <myzf> like this:
[10:28:13] <myzf> <a href="1.html" class="openinframe">
[10:28:13] <myzf> <a href="2.html" class="openinframe">
[10:28:13] <myzf> <a href="3.html" class="openinframe">
[10:29:00] <beebles_> http://pastebin.com/ZLzL9Zpf
[10:29:05] <myzf> cant write for 1000 members there own dialog
[10:30:12] <astropirate> mytoz, then you just read the lists when they are populated,    $('your list selector').find('a').each(function() {   var $this = $(this);    $("example").load( $this.attr('href'));  });
[10:30:56] <jeffsmykil> I hop and it always fixes my code NoiseEee

[10:32:47] <beebles_> i need to know why cycle js doesn't format my images into a slideshow..
[10:41:05] <NoiseEee> beebles_: You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
[10:41:23] <newb> hello! I have 12 checkboxes, 4 for each question. I want a jquery code to check if the 3 questions already have answers. Somebody have suggestions to solve this?
[10:41:26] <NoiseEee> also, you pasted nary a single line of js/jquery beebles_
[10:43:39] <beebles_> http://pastebin.com/mckpTavq <-----  tahts what generated
[10:44:42] <newb> beebles_: the header information of your file is missing, or the output part with the javascript files
[10:49:37] <beebles_> http://www.monicachristinephotography.com/portfolios/children/
[10:49:41] <beebles_> webpage source
[10:49:47] <beebles_> you can checked out the headerfiles
[10:49:58] <beebles_> and scroll down to the div area provided in the pastebin
[10:51:04] <beebles_> the script which initializes cycle plugin is activate.cycle.js, it just invokes the simple call to provided in the demo to #gallery1
[10:51:43] <MeXTuX> I have a hidden div and want to show it with a scale effect when I click a button. Does anybody have a working example???
[10:52:06] <beebles_> goto leepchangphotography.com
[10:52:22] <beebles_> click on my nav is taht the effect u want?
[10:54:44] <MeXTuX> IS something like this http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/#default when you select the scale effect
[10:54:58] <MeXTuX> but im a noob using jQuery
[10:57:42] <Eviltwin> MeXTuX: What kind of scale effect?
[10:57:46] <beebles_> all u need to do is use the .animate function
[10:57:51] <Eviltwin> Scale to what size from what size?
[10:57:56] <beebles_> and modify the width and height properities
[10:59:28] <MeXTuX> I want it to be hidden and when I click a button it must show
[10:59:41] <newb> beebles_: I need a fast exit now, but try this: change that file content to use $j instead of $.
[10:59:42] <newb> There is a file loaded who uses $j = jQuery.noConflict(), and I think can be related. Maybe somebody with better experience with jQuery can help here, but for awhile I could sugget this.
[10:59:44] <MeXTuX> width is 330 px
[11:00:41] <Eviltwin> MeXTuX: Height?
[11:00:59] <MeXTuX> 411 px

[11:14:54] <nvez> Hi guys!  Does anyone know if there's an existing plugin for floating divs that are no longer visible? (ex: like those sites where the nav bar is at the top of the page, when you scroll down and its not visible, it floats at the top of the page with a bit of opacity).. I don't wanna go through the mess of coding it to find out that there's an existing plugin :p
[11:18:52] <Eviltwin> nvez: Something like this? http://www.ruturaj.net/auto-sticking-header-with-scroll-jquery
[11:19:08] <nvez> yes!
[11:19:56] <nvez> that was around what I was going to do, but fantastic, thank you so much Eviltwin
[11:20:22] <dp> is there a way to resize an iframe such that it has no scrollbars, and then stop resizing?
[11:22:28] <RedFox2> Hey
[11:23:29] <RedFox2> I have a design problem: I have pages and a user needs to enable them somehow. They need to be easily put into a list and removed afterwards. Has anyone an idea what plugin I could use or a hint at all? Thx.
[11:24:11] <RedFox2> it's like: I have page1, page2, page3, and the user can select and move the pages1-3 to another box (from the other box itll be removed). Maybe there's better solution for this kind of stuff
[11:24:14] <RedFox2> thanks in advance

[11:28:44] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/C7nVE/
[11:28:50] <andrew9183> how do i only remove the div with foo ?
[11:29:51] <andrew9183> ie i just want to remove (string: )
[11:30:33] <Eviltwin> Wait, what?
[11:30:49] <Eviltwin> You want to remove the string?
[11:31:14] <andrew9183> yeah
[11:31:18] <andrew9183> actually let me update
[11:31:55] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/C7nVE/1/
[11:32:53] <andrew9183> yeah that could work
[11:32:58] <andrew9183> but is there a way to do it with this method: http://jsfiddle.net/C7nVE/2/
[11:33:31] <Eviltwin> A) Never use document.write
[11:33:32] <Eviltwin> Ever
[11:34:08] <Eviltwin> B) You don't really seem to understand JavaScript muchless jQuery based on what I've seen here
[11:34:26] <Eviltwin> C) If you remove an element, you also remove everything inside it
[11:34:42] <Eviltwin> In other words #bar, the p tag, and hello world also go away
[11:34:45] <andrew9183> ahh
[11:35:07] <Eviltwin> I really think you need to read through this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[11:35:20] <andrew9183> i've read jqfundamentals.com
[11:35:43] <omw> Hi there. I have a problem with .serialize() and the + character
[11:35:51] <Eviltwin> Sorry, this is really bad code here
[11:36:01] <omw> As far as I am able to see, + is not encoded
[11:36:59] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: You'll see there's no mention of document.write on jqfundamentals
[11:37:23] <Eviltwin> And it looks like you need to learn more about JavaScript too
[11:37:46] <beebles_> NEWB U ARE THE GREATEST!!
[11:37:51] <andrew9183> i used document.write for the sake of brevity
[11:37:54] <beebles_> thanks i was just having conflicts with my libs
[11:37:56] <andrew9183> i could just as easy use console.log
[11:38:03] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Just never, ever use it
[11:38:04] <Eviltwin> Please
[11:38:05] <Eviltwin> Ever
[11:38:10] <Eviltwin> No matter what
[11:38:15] <andrew9183> can you get over it already ?
[11:38:18] <andrew9183> thank you.
[11:38:26] <pcperini> so, i have a div that changes size depending on content (via CSS, not manually through javascript) is there a way to animate that resize when i use methods like jQuery's insertBefore() to change the content?
[11:38:42] <Eviltwin> omw: http://jsfiddle.net/hwUKf/
[11:39:05] <someprimetime> what's the deal with passing optional parameters? i took care of the undefined case and it still tells me that clonedWidth is undefined : http://jsfiddle.net/kBhwp/
[11:39:23] <someprimetime> assuming clonedWidth isn't set before function declaration
[11:39:28] <omw> eviltwin: Excellent - it proves the problem.
[11:39:47] <Eviltwin> omw: I see "foo=%2B"
[11:39:50] <Eviltwin> What were you expecting?
[11:39:55] <omw> Eviltwin: As far as I can see from the source, the problem is that it uses unescape(encodeURIComponent(escape( value )))
[11:40:10] <omw> I got "+" in the result
[11:40:12] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Can you explain further
[11:40:25] <Eviltwin> omw: You saw "foo=+"?
[11:40:30] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: well i want to be able to either included clonedWidth before the i call the function, or just leave it blank
[11:40:43] <andrew9183> wheres ajpiano these days
[11:40:47] <someprimetime> in case someone doesn't want to specify the width, it'd be taken care of within the function itself
[11:40:57] <someprimetime> i basically want an optional parameter
[11:41:02] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: JavaScript functions can accept any number of arguments and you can pass them any number of arguments
[11:41:03] <someprimetime> of "clonedWidth"
[11:41:07] <omw> Eviltwin: sorry, the alert shows foo=%2B
[11:41:17] <Eviltwin> If you pass them too few, all the remaining ones at the right will be undefined
[11:41:27] <Eviltwin> If you pass too many, they get dropped from the right
[11:41:30] <omw> Now, why do not I get that in my app..
[11:41:40] <Eviltwin> omw: Perhaps you're actually encoding a space?
[11:41:44] <Eviltwin> Those encode as +'s
[11:41:45] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: then shouldn't it not give me an undefined error?
[11:41:49] <someprimetime> since i put it @ the end
[11:41:58] <omw> I am definitively encoding +-es
[11:41:58] <andrew9183> so eviltwin, what would you use instead of document.write ?
[11:41:59] <someprimetime> and i have a case defining what to do if it's undefined
[11:42:10] <omw> space should be %20 though
[11:42:14] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I don't really have enough code here to see what you're doing wrong
[11:42:15] <omw> + is deprecated
[11:42:21] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: let me post the whole thing
[11:42:23] <someprimetime> h/o
[11:42:23] <Eviltwin> omw: What's your source on that?
[11:42:40] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: jQuery's .html
[11:43:09] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/kBhwp/1/
[11:43:13] <DJTrey> can someone please tell me why I'm not getting a twitter follower count back? http://jsfiddle.net/xNNQE/
[11:43:21] <someprimetime> so if i uncomment var clonedWidth on line 3, it'll work fine
[11:43:29] <someprimetime> but suppose i don't define that variable
[11:43:45] <someprimetime> does that mean i should leave it out when i call the function as the last parameter?
[11:43:50] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: You should never be in a situation where you don't know what variables are defined
[11:43:58] <Eviltwin> If you're in that situation, you've done something horribly wrong
[11:44:03] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to have someone configure this?
[11:44:07] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: the only reason i'm doing this is so people can specify a custom width for the cloned window
[11:44:12] <someprimetime> otherwise it'll use the original width
[11:44:22] <Eviltwin> And you want them to configure by commenting/uncommenting vars?
[11:44:27] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: no lol
[11:44:32] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: something more elegant
[11:44:37] <RedFox2> I'm looking for a plugin which does basically the following (red zone): http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/2926/adminpanelwp1.png   THX
[11:44:40] <someprimetime> any suggestions?
[11:44:42] <Eviltwin> So why do you have a commented var here?
[11:44:45] <omw> Eviltwin: jquery.ajax({data: form.serialize(), ...}, where the form has a selected <option value="EQUITIES+PCC+ETPS+RIGHTS">Alle</option>
[11:45:10] <RedFox2> has anyone an idea? thx
[11:45:17] <Eviltwin> omw: If there's an error, demonstrate it in a jsFiddle, please
[11:45:28] <someprimetime> because if i decide i want the cloned container larger than the original one (since this is just cloning a container and making it sticky) i have to specify it somewhere
[11:45:40] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: You can't reference a variable before it's defined
[11:45:43] <Eviltwin> Let me show you what I was talking about
[11:45:46] <someprimetime> ok
[11:45:58] <someprimetime> i was sort of going off of this previous fwiw: http://www.tipstrs.com/tip/354/Using-optional-parameters-in-Javascript-functions
[11:46:10] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/kBhwp/2/
[11:46:18] <omw> Eviltwin: I'll try
[11:46:40] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: inside stickyContainer, clonedWidth will be defined and be defined as "undefined"
[11:46:41] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: oh god
[11:46:49] <sokie> cant those entries just move to the other box (or being copied there) by clicking on em, RedFox2?
[11:46:49] <someprimetime> it's too early in the morning
[11:46:53] <someprimetime> i should have known better lol
[11:46:56] <Eviltwin> But you can't refer to a variable before it's defined
[11:47:02] <someprimetime> yeah, totally got it now
[11:47:13] <RedFox2> sokie, they can, the first "dropdown" (Entries from above) can be removed
[11:47:14] <someprimetime> sorry bout that
[11:47:22] <Eviltwin> K, cool
[11:47:32] <someprimetime> thanks bud
[11:47:35] <Eviltwin> np
[11:49:31] <sokie> so select the <td> from the upper table and move them on click to the list...
[11:49:55] <DJTrey> can someone please tell me why I'm not getting a twitter follower count back? http://jsfiddle.net/xNNQE/

[11:53:56] <pavan168> Hi
[11:54:11] <pavan168> Ive a problem with javascript and jquery
[11:54:19] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: JavaScript is really designed to work with DOM elements
[11:54:35] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't bounce back and forth between elements and HTML unnecessarily
[11:54:58] <andrew9183> how would i achieve this using jquery strictly ?
[11:54:59] <Eviltwin> Here you have $(bar) then immediately you clone it
[11:55:03] <Eviltwin> Why?
[11:55:22] <Eviltwin> When $() is called on HTML tags, it makes brand new elements
[11:55:28] <Eviltwin> No need to clone
[11:57:13] <andrew9183> ah , thanks eviltwin
[11:57:36] <RedFox2> what did I miss? http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/ thx
[11:57:40] <Eviltwin> It's because of things like that that I say you may have missed a few chapters of jqfundamentals
[11:57:54] <andrew9183> yeah, i know what you mean
[11:58:04] <andrew9183> but theres a certain aspect of how i learn by being pragmatic rather than straight reading
[11:58:07] <andrew9183> and not experimenting
[11:58:12] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: See if you can tell the difference: http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/1/
[11:58:50] <andrew9183> if that were the case, i would be a super star golfer by now with all the books ive read on golf, but yet my handicap is still 50+
[11:59:09] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, no wrap head? :D
[11:59:11] <pavan1681> guys will youll be able to help>
[11:59:18] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: Yup
[11:59:24] <josefrichter> guys, can I append an element and immediately bind an event to it? like $(this).append(<a></a>).click(function(){…});
[11:59:30] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, thx
[11:59:31] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ pavan1681
[11:59:31] <bot-t> pavan1681, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:59:36] <pavan1681> i badly need help if anyone is willing to help
[11:59:42] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: Well for one thing you're missing some quotes
[11:59:55] <pavan1681> i have a function which dynamically loads an array into the page. in that div tag ive specified a class name and a id. and the id is unique for all the div tags. i catch the click function by using "$(".s").live({
[11:59:56] <pavan1681>   click: function() {" inside the " $(document).ready(function() {" and then call another fucntion by passsing that id value. the other fucntion is placed outside " $(document).ready(function() {". however it is placed inside the javascript fucntion. inside the other function is a $post method but it does not get called. Any ideas??
[12:00:04] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: For the rest of your question there are two options
[12:00:07] <josefrichter> Eviltwin sure.
[12:00:17] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: One is to invert it
[12:00:27] <Eviltwin> $("<a></a>").appendTo(this).click(function(){...})
[12:00:27] <andrew9183> eviltwin: do you agree ?
[12:00:40] <chrisvwebdev> @eviltwin:  thanks.  i'll try that out
[12:00:48] <myzf> hi
[12:00:53] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: The other is to generate the "<a>" inside the .append and bind the click inside there
[12:01:07] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: $(this).append($("<a></a>").click(function(){...}));
[12:01:07] <pavan1681> Eviltwin will you be able to check on my problem
[12:01:24] <josefrichter> Eviltwin ash, cool! thanks!
[12:01:26] <Eviltwin> josefrichter: Also, you can always do $("<a>") instead of $("<a></a>")
[12:01:29] <chrisvwebdev> eviltwin..that did it
[12:01:29] <Eviltwin> jQuery knows what you mean
[12:01:29] <chrisvwebdev> thanks
[12:01:35] <myzf> can everyone help me to make my code slimmer http://dpaste.com/676428/
[12:01:50] <chrisvwebdev> dont' know why i didn't try that.  it's obvious now
[12:02:05] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ pavan1681
[12:02:06] <bot-t> pavan1681, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[12:02:21] <Eviltwin> chrisvwebdev: Don't try to do in JavaScript what the browser already does for you :P
[12:02:32] <Eviltwin> myzf: This looks like PHP
[12:02:36] <Eviltwin> Or something
[12:02:41] <pavan1681> i have a function which dynamically loads an array into the page. in that div tag ive specified a class name and a id. and the id is unique for all the div tags.
[12:02:49] <Eviltwin> pavan1681: Code
[12:02:50] <pavan1681> i catch the click function by using "$(".s").live({
[12:02:50] <pavan1681>   click: function() {" inside the " $(document).ready(function() {"
[12:02:51] <Eviltwin> Show us the code
[12:02:55] <Eviltwin> Like in a jsFiddle
[12:03:01] <pavan1681> and then call another fucntion by passsing that id value. the other fucntion is placed outside " $(document).ready(function() {".
[12:03:01] <Eviltwin> Not the little fragments
[12:03:02] <pavan1681> however it is placed inside the javascript fucntion. inside the other function is a $post method but it does not get called. Any ideas??
[12:03:05] <Eviltwin> The actual code
[12:03:16] <pavan1681> but problem is $post is not functioning

[12:03:30] <Icehuu> When I use .load() to load an html file with style into a textarea, why does nothing (but spaces) appear?
[12:03:52] <pavan1681> i wll do it in fiddle
[12:03:56] <pavan1681> give a sec
[12:03:56] <DofLeFou> Can anyone help with this …. I m reading the content of my query.js file from some external source … I then then append it on a js file i m creating locally on my app …. my when this js file is run … I m getting some error on my Jquery section
[12:04:02] <Eviltwin> myzf: Is there any difference between array_pust($arr,...) and $arr[] = ... ?
[12:04:22] <myzf> @eviltwin no
[12:04:35] <DofLeFou> but I add the file directly without appending its content to my file … it works just fine
[12:04:37] <Eviltwin> myzf: There's a good place to slim then :P
[12:04:43] <DofLeFou> what am I missing?
[12:05:04] <Eviltwin> Your if(isset) { /*A*/ } else { /*B*/}
[12:05:09] <Eviltwin> A and B appear to do the exact same thing
[12:05:32] <myzf> yea but how? i don´t know how to push something in an array when it don´t exists
[12:05:56] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/C7nVE/7/
[12:06:02] <Eviltwin> if(!isset($arr)) $arr = array(); /* A */
[12:06:02] <Eviltwin> ?
[12:06:07] <andrew9183> almost there.. is there a way to get it without wrapping the whole thing in a div then doing it ?
[12:06:16] <myzf> ok thanks
[12:06:19] <andrew9183> i just don't want to run eq[0]
[12:06:21] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/2/ << do you know how I can check if A, B or C already got inserted? I dont want it twice. Thx ;)
[12:06:26] <myzf> sounds great :)
[12:06:28] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Why not?
[12:06:46] <mightym> hey guys, i need to add a class at the beginning of a if clause, and remove it afterwards … the class contains a css transition … if i use addClass() and removeClass(), there is no css transition, if i use just addClass at the beginning it works … someone a hint for me how to solve that?
[12:06:47] <andrew9183> the block of code might be different, ie theres other things above that block
[12:06:57] <pavan1681> Guys
[12:06:59] <pavan1681> check it out
[12:06:59] <pavan1681> http://jsfiddle.net/vm7s5/
[12:07:15] <pavan1681> i cant produce the output becaise all are in JS
[12:07:16] <andrew9183> what if there was another div infront of div#foo
[12:07:54] <pavan1681> first triggers the rint Follower() function then when i click on the "show" button the click fucntion is caught
[12:08:13] <pavan1681> then sent to Userstatus()
[12:08:29] <pavan1681> inside userstatus() the $.post method is not fucntioning
[12:08:40] <pavan1681> it does not send a POST request to my servelt for some reason
[12:09:00] <pavan1681> however th alert box produces the name
[12:09:04] <pavan1681> no issues with that
[12:09:17] <pavan1681> but the post metod is nto functioning
[12:09:19] <DofLeFou> Anyone has some idea with this https://gist.github.com/1507494

[12:13:15] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: There might be other things?
[12:13:30] <Eviltwin> Like between <div id="foo"> and string?
[12:13:36] <Eviltwin> I don't understand
[12:13:43] <mightym> hmmm, no one a hint? maybe i need to set a delay on removing the class? but this might me bad because the if clause can be called very often
[12:13:52] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, does not quite work, http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/7/
[12:14:20] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, I can insert A twice

[12:16:26] <RedFox2> thx Eviltwin
[12:16:46] <newb> beebles_: sorry, I'm was out of my computer. Only now I saw your message. I'm glad to have helped :)
[12:17:08] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Can you show an example of when there are other elements?
[12:17:10] <pavan1681> what was wrong in my code?
[12:17:57] <Eviltwin> pavan1681: I don't know
[12:18:03] <pavan1681> did you make anythgin?
[12:18:06] <pavan1681> *anything
[12:18:11] <Eviltwin> pavan1681: I added userstatus("x"); at the bottom

[12:18:49] <pavan1681> did youll undrstood the problem?
[12:19:21] <Eviltwin> pavan1681: Read through this: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:19:24] <Eviltwin> All the way through
[12:21:36] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, I hope last question: I can remove A but I cannot push it again into the list: http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/14/

[12:21:56] <pavan1681> is this a jquery problem?
[12:21:59] <Yahav> hey guys
[12:22:04] <Yahav> i really need some help
[12:22:09] <Yahav> http://81.218.230.10/~oards/
[12:22:18] <Yahav> check out the footer and the top bar animations
[12:22:27] <andrew9183> Eviltwin: my apologies, I misread your example
[12:22:28] <Yahav> they are overlapping and stucking each other
[12:22:36] <newb> People, I have a form with 4 checkboxes and the same name for all. I need know if there are an option checked or not using the name property. Somebody can help me with this? In reality I have hundreds of questions to do this, but if I solve for one I'm ok.
[12:22:43] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Figured :)
[12:23:03] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: .contents() gets each node in the element
[12:23:05] <omw> Eviltwin: I figured it out. One of my co-workers has patched our jquery library
[12:23:14] <Eviltwin> First one being "string: ", second one being the bar element, etc
[12:23:16] <pavan1681> Eviltwin you got to check my code. ive read this ppt before
[12:23:20] <Eviltwin> So I grab the first one and remove it
[12:23:23] <RedFox2> re, pushed wrong button
[12:23:28] <Eviltwin> pavan1681: Actually I don't got to do anything
[12:23:40] <Eviltwin> omw: Eww
[12:23:42] <andrew9183> yeah i get it now
[12:23:47] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, have you got an idea? =)
[12:23:59] <andrew9183> what if the string: was not wrapped around the whole string, ie: http://jsfiddle.net/C7nVE/9/
[12:24:05] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: I'm still not sure what this is supposed to do, sorry
[12:24:05] <pavan1681> well my prblem is why post is not working
[12:24:09] <pavan1681> $post method
[12:24:19] <mightym> well thanks anyway!
[12:24:33] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, I want to add elements and remove them. It does work except with A. I can remove it but NOT add it again.
[12:25:06] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, B or C they do work fine.
[12:26:20] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: That will still remove the
[12:26:22] <Eviltwin> Err
[12:26:22] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/C7nVE/10/
[12:26:50] <Eviltwin> Or this: http://jsfiddle.net/C7nVE/11/
[12:27:10] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: Generically what are you trying to do
[12:27:25] <Eviltwin> Add and remove things from a <select> list?
[12:27:29] <RedFox2> yes ;)
[12:27:30] <Eviltwin> What does this list represent?
[12:27:43] <Eviltwin> Why are there options to add things to it and remove things from it
[12:27:46] <RedFox2> They are pages from wordpress but A to C are just example data in order to get it working
[12:28:04] <RedFox2> (before I implement it)
[12:28:10] <Eviltwin> But why are you adding and removing things to/from a select?
[12:29:16] <RedFox2> these are global pages, special treatments, user should be able to delete and add elements
[12:29:20] <RedFox2> thats the reason ;)
[12:29:26] <andrew9183> thanks for clarifying it Eviltwin
[12:29:40] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: I could understand perhaps two lists that you're moving back and forth between
[12:29:46] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: This just seems odd to me
[12:29:56] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Remember that while HTML is a flat string, the DOM is a tree
[12:30:11] <Eviltwin> #foo contains "string: " and #bar
[12:30:16] <RedFox2> I have a list with pages then a user can press the button "add to global list" and then they appear in the select. If a user wants to remove them he should be able to do so.
[12:30:22] <Eviltwin> And removing or emptying #foo removes #bar too
[12:30:36] <Eviltwin> So if you want to remove just the string, you need to find just the string and remove it
[12:30:45] <andrew9183> Eviltwin: ah, I see
[12:30:58] <RedFox2> I want to remove the option ;)
[12:31:07] <andrew9183> so that is why you'd suggest using the DOM to remove it via javascript ?
[12:31:21] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: 'Cause JavaScript operates on the DOM :P
[12:31:27] <Eviltwin> JavaScript doesn't like to deal with HTML
[12:31:49] <Eviltwin> DOM being the tree I spoke of
[12:32:04] <Eviltwin> Where you can do things like .find() and .parent() etc
[12:33:40] <andrew9183> ah
[12:35:41] <someprimetime> so i'm using the jquery form plugin, and upon using the success function, i'm going like success : function (data, $form) { $form.find('input[name=email]').hide(); } but i'm getting a typerror of: Object success has no method 'find'. that shouldn't be an object specific method. right?
[12:36:51] <martndemus> Can anyone explain me why jQuery uses --- var jQuery = (function() { // all the codez goes here }()); ? Why the self calling function?
[12:36:52] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/15/
[12:37:04] <Eviltwin> martndemus: It creates a closure
[12:37:11] <martndemus> Eviltwin: thats all?
[12:37:23] <Eviltwin> All of the var's inside look like they're global to the functions inside
[12:37:27] <Eviltwin> But they're inaccessable outside
[12:37:28] <JJMalina> what's the best way to zip two arrays together, one having keys and the other having the values?
[12:37:43] <Eviltwin> JJMalina: Into an object or what?
[12:37:44] <NoiseEee> JJMalina: hmmm?
[12:37:45] <martndemus> Eviltwin: but what about the closure that wraps that one?
[12:37:47] <pifantastic> ?g underscore.js @ JJMalina
[12:37:48] <bot-t> JJMalina, Underscore.js - Open Source - GitHub - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[12:37:55] <JJMalina> Eviltwin: yes sorry i meant an object
[12:38:07] <Eviltwin> martndemus: All about keeping scope separate
[12:38:15] <Eviltwin> JJMalina: Are they always going to be the same length?
[12:38:21] <martndemus> Eviltwin: cool, thanks :)
[12:38:25] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: that's the most elegant way i've heard that explained, ever.
[12:38:25] <andrew9183> hey Eviltwin: how would i remove the div#foo too ?
[12:38:30] <someprimetime> of a "closure"
[12:38:35] <someprimetime> gj
[12:38:39] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Hah, thanks
[12:38:51] <pifantastic> JJMalina: reading the annotated source for how underscore implements zip() is probably a great start: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/docs/underscore.html#section-47
[12:38:53] <JJMalina> Eviltwin: yeah there will be the same number of keys as values
[12:38:56] <someprimetime> it took me forever to understand what a closure was, but yeah it's nice when people put things in simple terms
[12:39:00] <andrew9183> ie: http://jsfiddle.net/C7nVE/14/
[12:39:11] <NoiseEee> andrew9183: while you've found a great tutor in Eviltwin, you need to get acquainted with the basics of both JS and jquery.   that last question is completely documented on jquery.com as are several others you've had
[12:40:52] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Yeah, you really do need to look at things like .eq, .slice, .next, .parent, etc.
[12:40:56] <someprimetime> anyone know when using the jquery form helper plugin, why it won't allow me to use the find() method within the success callback?
[12:41:39] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: What's happening?
[12:41:45] <Eviltwin> Are you doing this.find()?
[12:42:08] <someprimetime> nah, i'm passing in $form and using $form.find() but i'll try this instead
[12:42:26] <Eviltwin> It'll probably need to be $(this).find
[12:42:35] <someprimetime> or $(thi).find
[12:42:37] <someprimetime> err yeah haha
[12:42:40] <someprimetime> whoops this*
[12:44:32] <andrew9183> What function would I need to look at for this ?
[12:45:14] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Start reading through this list: http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[12:45:17] <Mundix> i have a problema using $.post() with an api url i create and i don't know how to works fine ?

[12:55:48] <said> @Eviltwin: skitter slideshow here http://thiagosf.net/projects/jquery/skitter/
[12:57:04] <said> @Eviltwin: I copied the code there.
[12:57:23] <ravenzz> emx is(':checked') "Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments."
[12:58:09] <ravenzz> if you want to select the checked ones $('input[type="checkbox"]:checked')
[12:58:19] <emx> ravenzz, thanks
[13:01:23] <Mundix> eviltwin !!
[13:02:47] <Dima_> hi guys, i have a rather hard to describe question that i am unable to find a solution for by using google/forums/searching.  my issue is this: i have an element on my page, say class='foo'.  i want to apply a mouseover event to all elements with that class - so far, no problem.  on mouse over i want function bar() to execute; again, no problem.  the problem comes into play here-- during that mouseover event, my var, varWidth, is chan
[13:02:53] <otters> okay, in an element's click handler, how can I access the specific element that got clicked? I attached the handler to several elements of the same class
[13:03:13] <Eviltwin> ravenzz: Is there also a :checkbox selector?
[13:03:15] <Dima_> however, with my mouseover implementation, the alert only happens AFTER i mouseout... by which point, i already missed the stopping point where i had the desired width...
[13:03:37] <Knightarr> I am trying to addMethod to a validator, for custom validation of a hidden field.  I have an alert in the function definition for the validator.  It is not being fired.  Anyone have any insight as to why?
[13:03:40] <Eviltwin> Dima_: Can you demostrate your problem as jsFiddle.net?
[13:04:21] <Dima_> Eviltwin: yes and no; i can create a similar proof of concept, however, my real code is using a TON of various plugins and is a huge project that i cannot upload
[13:04:57] <Eviltwin> Dima_: Absolutely looking for the proof of concept
[13:05:01] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ Dima_
[13:05:02] <bot-t> Dima_, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[13:05:26] <Knightarr> here's my validation code: http://pastebin.com/mnZZy48x - BasicRule2 is a hidden input field
[13:05:28] <Dima_> yep yep -thanks guys.  working on making that code.. be back in about 10-15min
[13:05:38] <ravenzz> Eviltwin sure
[13:05:40] <Knightarr> as you can see, I've tried what seems like everything (naming my validation method to something stupid)
[13:06:19] <Knightarr> Using the dom inspector, I can see the "hehe" function has been attached to the dom tree as well
[13:07:43] <LordThumper> Can Sortable only work on lists?
[13:09:07] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, could you take a look at my jsfiddle?
[13:09:16] <RedFox2> http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/14/
[13:09:52] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: Thought I sent you this back: http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/15/
[13:11:48] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, thanks - this snippet does the trick.
[13:12:23] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: I know. You're welcome. :D
[13:13:05] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, ;) this jquery has sometimes it's own brain :D
[13:15:41] <Dima_> Eviltwin, bot-t: here is a very, very rough shell of what i'm working on.. while typing up this sample code, i had the idea that MAYBE if i put something like while( this has focus) { loop } inside my mouseover event, that might fix my issue.. alas, im not certain if such a "hasFocus" exists - searching now
[13:16:12] <Eviltwin> Um...okay... let's just take a look
[13:19:55] <Eviltwin> Dima_: You didn't link anything
[13:20:15] <Dima_> http://jsfiddle.net/7peuF/
[13:20:27] <Dima_> my bad
[13:21:34] <Eviltwin> Dima_: I guess I'm still not sure I understand the goal
[13:22:05] <Dima_> fair enough. let me try to explain again... im double screwed; cant get code to work AND cant explain anything for the life of me
[13:22:22] <Dima_> are you at all familiar w the smoothDivScroll plugin?
[13:22:50] <Eviltwin> No but I just looked at a demo
[13:22:55] <Dima_> cool :)
[13:28:04] <NoiseEee> how to tell if an element has draggable functionality (via the draggable jqueryUI plugin) ?
[13:28:16] <Dima_> so the idea is that to reduce page load time, instead of loading all my results into the scroll pane, i only load the first 12.  when the user scrolls past the 10th result, i want to fire another function to ajax in the next 10 results.  so, i create a mouseover event and attach it in addition to the default scroll pane arrow.  i have all the math/logic to determine exactly when i need to load the next set of results, when X <= Y.
[13:28:21] <Dima_> this is where the issue is; the mouseover event i defined checks X and Y and if X <= Y, it correctly fires the next function to ajax more results.  however, the conditional only returns true once the mouseover event is complete instead of happening the second that that condition is actually true.. does this make more sense?
[13:28:21] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: Is this for you or for your code
[13:28:30] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: Code shouldn't really be poking at these things
[13:29:24] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: for my code, im trying to set up a "stop draggables" <add new elements> "re-init draggables", but in my stop draggables function, I try $('.myClass').draggable('destroy') and I get "cannot call methods on droppable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'destroy'"
[13:29:40] <NoiseEee> ahh there's a clue, droppable.
[13:30:34] <NoiseEee> bad selector my bad (urf)
[13:31:49] <NoiseEee> but still, I can't do something like  if($('.myClass').draggable)   ?
[13:32:11] <NoiseEee> to see if its been initialized on that?
[13:32:19] <RedFox2> hmm... Eviltwin, can I add a <input type="hidden" name="" value=""> when adding and removing that when removing? Otherwise I can't really submit it - I figured out lol
[13:33:07] <Dima___> Eviltwin: did that explanation make any more sense, or still confused?
[13:33:08] <ajpiano> you can do if ( $("#foo").is(":ui-draggable") {} or if ( $("#foo").data("draggable") ) {} NoiseEee
[13:33:41] <ajpiano> the former basically being an alias for the latter
[13:34:37] <Eviltwin> Dima___: Wht isn't this working on the scroll event?
[13:34:40] <Eviltwin> Why*
[13:34:52] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: Uh, sure
[13:34:53] <Eviltwin> Why not?
[13:35:06] <NoiseEee> thanks ajpiano
[13:35:17] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, sec want to try it myself first ;)
[13:35:29] <Dima___> well, like i said; the mouseover event itself is indeed working.  you can tell it's triggered and code inside is executed via console.log()
[13:35:53] <Dima___> however, its calling the ajaxMoreResults() function on mouseout once X <= Y
[13:36:01] <Dima___> instead of calling that function immediately when X <= Y
[13:36:21] <Dima___> essentially, it's only checking the conditional inside once, instead of continually checking it while moused over
[13:36:39] <Eviltwin> Dima___: I suggest you look at these instead: http://www.smoothdivscroll.com/#callbacks
[13:37:44] <Eviltwin> Or the "ajaxContentURL"
[13:38:27] <Dima___> yep, i've read his documentation. his callbacks dont apply in my case - im comparing the contents of the smoothDivScroll to my window to find X and Y.  and his ajax routine is subpar; we're using a much more robust custom ajax class
[13:38:47] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/BRHay/18/ ?????
[13:38:51] <RedFox2> wrong approach?
[13:38:59] <Dima___> i appreciate your help Eviltwin
[13:38:59] <Eviltwin> Probably
[13:39:07] <Dima___> ill continue looking around and experimenting
[13:39:27] <Dima___> i thought maybe this was a somewhat common issue with jquery events
[13:39:32] <Dima___> so i asked
[13:39:32] <Dima___> :)
[13:39:46] <Eviltwin> Dima___: Well you asked in a way that was extremely specific to this plugin
[13:39:52] <Eviltwin> Maybe I misunderstood
[13:40:42] <Dima___> hmm yeah, i can understand that.. let me drop a small chunk of my code w comments and show you one more time; maybe this will demonstrate better
[13:44:36] <Dima___> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/8T6KjCLt
[13:44:42] <Dima___> hope that makes it a little clearer :!
[13:51:47] <RedFox2> Eviltwin ? ;)
[13:57:01] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: I would do something more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/cLVML/
[13:57:06] <Eviltwin> Forgive the (lack of) style
[14:04:38] <RedFox2> thx can i del the not selected?
[14:04:58] <velts_> can someone tell me the difference between $('a.button', $('#container')); and $('#container').find('a.button') ?
[14:06:32] <Eviltwin> ?tias @ RedFox2
[14:06:32] <bot-t> RedFox2, Try It And See
[14:06:44] <Eviltwin> I think I've written enough code for you for a lifetime :P
[14:13:45] <texinwien> join phonegap
[14:13:49] <RedFox2> eviltwin hehehe thx
[14:16:19] <LordThumper> How do you guys attach jQuery to newly created elements?
[14:16:44] <LordThumper> Should I call a function to reattach the jQuery every time I create elements?
[14:16:52] <Eviltwin> jQuery isn't attached to elements
[14:17:04] <LordThumper> I mean jQuery event handling
[14:17:21] <Eviltwin> Ask "How do you bind event listeners to newly created elements"
[14:17:24] <LordThumper> like $('#test').click()
[14:17:35] <Eviltwin> Or "How do you attach event listeners to newly created elements"
[14:17:44] <LordThumper> Ok thanks
[14:17:51] <Eviltwin> It's very important to get at least "listener" in the question
[14:18:14] <Eviltwin> If the newly-created elements have unique behavior, yes, bind "each time"
[14:18:28] <LordThumper> Yes, Sortable/Draggable
[14:18:32] <Eviltwin> If they have the same behavior as a bunch of existing ones, you might want to look at the delegate syntax
[14:18:42] <LordThumper> ok
[14:18:44] <Eviltwin> You're creating draggables and sortables?
[14:18:55] <Eviltwin> Dynamically?
[14:19:36] <LordThumper> Yes
[14:20:05] <LordThumper> I am cloning a div containing sortable elements
[14:20:16] <Dima___> Eviltwin: i found a solution to my issue!!!! :D  instead of mouseover, if i use mousemove, it console.log() immediately once the values X, Y match the conditional
[14:20:22] <Dima___> thanks again for your help earlier :)
[14:21:04] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: Have you tried .clone(true,true)?
[14:22:00] <LordThumper> No, what do those parameters indicate please?
[14:22:02] <LordThumper> Trying that now
[14:22:11] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: There's a site you can go to
[14:22:24] <Eviltwin> That explains what every parameter to every jQuery function does
[14:22:32] <Eviltwin> I suggest you look at it
[14:22:39] <Eviltwin> It's called api.jquery.com
[14:22:39] <LordThumper> Yeah I am on it now
[14:22:48] <Eviltwin> So you tell me
[14:22:51] <Eviltwin> What do they do
[14:23:05] <martndemus> How does $(element) goes from jQuery.fn.init to [element], im trying to understand the source code
[14:23:20] <LordThumper> Yeah worked perfectly thanks
[14:23:36] <Eviltwin> martndemus: jQuery creates objects that are array-ish
[14:23:45] <Eviltwin> Or array-like
[14:24:27] <Eviltwin> So they have a .length and .slice property
[14:24:38] <martndemus> Eviltwin: if i try to recreate the jQuery.fn.init, then when i do $(element) i get jQuery.init as object returned
[14:25:09] <martndemus> so there must be another step happening after, but i can't trace what it is
[14:27:49] <martndemus> i see 'return jQuery.makeArray( selector, this );' but it will never call that because it should already have returned before that
[14:29:11] <Eviltwin> martndemus: They aren't actually arrays
[14:29:15] <Eviltwin> They just look like arrays
[14:29:20] <Eviltwin> So your browser may by lying to you
[14:29:35] <martndemus> its chrome
[14:30:07] <Apathetic> how do i prevent "&" from being converted into "&amp;"?
[14:30:14] <Eviltwin> martndemus: Try doing var o = {0:"foo",length:1,splice:function(){}};
[14:30:36] <Eviltwin> And then type "o"
[14:30:39] <Eviltwin> And see what it looks like
[14:31:20] <martndemus> aha
[14:31:22] <martndemus> i see
[14:31:37] <Eviltwin> So it's not actually an array
[14:31:44] <Eviltwin> Array's can't do things like .parent()
[14:32:16] <Apathetic> can i use .serialize() in ajax post requests?
[14:32:30] <Eviltwin> Apathetic: Sure, why not
[14:32:47] <Apathetic> but how do i fetch the values now?
[14:33:00] <Apathetic> in my php Script @Eviltwin
[14:33:07] <Eviltwin> Apathetic: Hmm?
[14:33:13] <Eviltwin> Do you know what a form-encoded string is?
[14:33:31] <Apathetic> so i should decode it first then?
[14:34:21] <Apathetic> no i shouldn't,
[14:34:38] <Eviltwin> Apathetic: I take it you know about $_GET and $_POST ?
[14:35:05] <Apathetic> yes ofc, maybe there's just something wrong with my script
[14:40:13] <Engin> $('foo').mouseover(funcName);
[14:40:21] <Engin> isn't funcName executed with proper this context
[14:40:38] <Engin> funcName is merely the name of the function without quotes or anything
[14:42:04] <Engin> ok my bad :D
[14:46:01] <coldhead> ?fweep
[14:46:02] <bot-t> coldhead, SHKLIZICH!
[14:46:25] <Engin> http://ideone.com/bYbme
[14:46:49] <Engin> I want to exclude input and texarea from a binding... but it doesn't work... mouseovers are still invoked
[14:46:51] <Engin> any idea
[14:47:15] <nFFF> Guys I work for an manafucturer of clothing, and we want oeasily allow retails to reseller the products. We've go a new range of products, and we want retailers to easily embed our range store on their site, can this be done with iframe and some js?
[14:48:50] <Engin> oh well
[14:50:09] <Engin> how can I run a function with a specific `this` ?
[14:50:26] <Engin> is there a jQ way, or shall I resort to classical binding snippet
[14:50:56] <ajpiano> $.proxy @ Engin
[14:51:01] <ajpiano> ?$.proxy @ Engin
[14:51:02] <bot-t> Engin, jQuery.proxy() - Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular scope. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[14:51:04] <slide> Im trying to fit a div to the entire window but it causes scroll bars to appear, im using $(window).height/width. I have in css all marings,padding and borders set to 0 as well
[14:53:45] <Engin> fantastic
[14:54:14] <Engin> aaaand
[14:54:18] <slide> n/m i just set overflow: hidden and now they stay the same size and no scrollbars show up
[14:54:34] <Engin> can I just select all the elements which have a particular attribute (any value) ?
[14:54:47] <Engin> now I'm also adding a class to the element t to select...
[14:55:29] <Engin> maybe [foo!=undefined] ?
[14:55:31] <Engin> hmm
[14:56:14] <Engin> mother of god
[14:56:16] <Engin> it works
[15:06:18] <mightym> does someone have experience with jquery/js & adding a css class with css transition to an element?
[15:06:52] <skamikaze> mightym: animate-css @ github .. ;)
[15:10:28] <someprimetime> is there a way to add an event handler to make sure that a function doesn't function after a specific action takes place?
[15:10:42] <someprimetime> e.g. on success of a function, i want to terminate all further instances of stickyContainer() from being called
[15:20:31] <kamo> Hello
[15:21:11] <kamo> I was wondering does anyone have problems with ASP.net and select html tags
[15:22:22] <skamikaze> ?preventDefault @ someprimetime
[15:22:23] <bot-t> someprimetime, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[15:24:07] <someprimetime> skamikaze: thanks
[15:27:50] <kamo> I was wondering does anyone have problems with ASP.net and select html tags
[15:28:12] <kamo> Here is the problem
[15:28:56] <kamo> In FF the value of drop down list will not change after page load
[15:28:58] <KWhat_Work> howmany args can you pass to widget._trigger()?
[15:29:03] <kamo> until refreshed

[15:30:17] <EyePulp> #sublimetext
[15:30:20] <EyePulp> heh
[15:34:23] <surfdue> How can I set a variable name dynamically? For example var fileExt = 'php'; mode + fileExt = fileExt; making modephp = 'php';
[15:34:35] <noord> hey i get date from datepicker on text field, and i see bool variable on handle page
[15:34:45] <noord> how can i get date from textbox
[15:35:24] <BinaryKitten> surfdue pretty much exactly like that
[15:35:52] <BinaryKitten> except that why would you need to have random variables?
[15:36:17] <BinaryKitten> what if fileExt = 'dow' an mode = 'win'
[15:36:24] <surfdue> BinaryKitten: would this work? var fileExt = 'php'; var editorMode = []; editorMode[fileExt] = require("ace/mode/" + fileExt).Mode; new editorMode.fileExt();
[15:36:39] <surfdue> (assuming the requirement is a function)
[15:36:42] <BinaryKitten> that would make window = dow which would screw it up
[15:36:58] <BinaryKitten> ahhh surfdue you're using array
[15:37:05] <surfdue> si. :)
[15:37:08] <BinaryKitten> right.. swithch that out for an object
[15:37:21] <BinaryKitten> in JavaScript arrays can only be numerically indexec
[15:37:25] <BinaryKitten> *indexed
[15:37:26] <surfdue> ah
[15:37:40] <BinaryKitten> var editorMode = {}; will solve your issue
[15:38:11] * surfdue crosses fingers
[15:38:32] <surfdue> BinaryKitten: would this not be the proper way to call? new editorMode.fileExt() I am getting undefined
[15:38:50] <BinaryKitten> urm nope
[15:39:05] <surfdue> editorMode[fileExt]
[15:39:07] <surfdue> seems to have worked.
[15:39:07] <BinaryKitten> since the object doesn't have a method called fileExt
[15:39:41] <BinaryKitten> yep, because you're referencing the object property using the variable as key
[15:39:43] <BinaryKitten> :)
[15:41:25] <surfdue> BinaryKitten: awesome.. next question. Using .gitScript $.getScript('/js/Ace/mode-' + fileExt + '.js'); does not seem to want to work
[15:41:38] <surfdue> however if I load it before hand in a script tag it works fine
[15:46:03] <surfdue> BinaryKitten: I fixed it ;)
[15:46:20] <BinaryKitten> cool.
[15:46:26] <BinaryKitten> sorry, not well ... going to go
[15:48:24] <cups> hey there, anyone know how to catch a load event on images coming in from an ajax response?  From what I see I can use a load function in the live method, and .load method doesn't support future elements
[15:48:35] <cups> *can't use load function in live method
[15:49:21] <Eviltwin> cups: see ?delegate
[15:49:31] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[15:49:36] <Eviltwin> api.jquery.com/delegate
[15:49:53] <BinaryKitten> delegate supports load when live doesn't Eviltwin?
[15:49:58] <cups> eviltwin, I think I tried looking at delegate but it wasn't working for me
[15:51:06] <cups> $(selector for exisiting and future element).delegate(load, function(){console.log(worked)})  doesn't seem to do anything :|
[15:51:17] <cups> $(selector for exisiting and future element).delegate('load', function(){console.log(worked)})  doesn't seem to do anything :|
[15:51:32] <Eviltwin> cups: Wait, what now?
[15:51:34] <Eviltwin> What's the goal?
[15:51:42] <BinaryKitten> that's not the delegate method cups
[15:51:51] <BinaryKitten> you're using live denotation
[15:51:55] <kamo> I was wondering does anyone have problems with ASP.net and select html tags
[15:52:08] <cups> I have images that are coming in from an ajax response, I want to do perform a function after the new images finished loading
[15:52:24] <cups> sorry to call a function after the images have finished loading
[15:52:36] <BinaryKitten> ?delegate
[15:52:37] <Eviltwin> Okay, in the success function for the AJAX
[15:52:41] <Eviltwin> When you're adding the images to the DOM
[15:52:45] <cups> yeah
[15:52:50] <Eviltwin> Bind a load directly to them
[15:53:03] <Eviltwin> In fact you might want to use a .one on them
[15:53:10] <cups> .one?
[15:53:17] <Eviltwin> cups: http://api.jquery.com/one/
[15:53:26] <cups> ok so look at .bind and .one ?
[15:53:26] <LordThumper> unbind() should unbind everything right?
[15:53:38] <mathi> hi
[15:53:42] <BinaryKitten> binds, waits for fire event once and then unbinds @cups
[15:53:44] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:53:50] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: Yes*
[15:53:52] <BinaryKitten> LordThumper yes
[15:53:54] <kamo> Hello can anyone help with this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1479233/why-doesnt-firefox-show-the-correct-default-select-option
[15:53:58] <mathi> is this: $(function(){... doing like $(document).ready(function() {...
[15:54:01] <cups> thanks eviltwin let me check it out
[15:54:05] <mathi> ?
[15:54:17] <BinaryKitten> mathi yes
[15:54:23] <LordThumper> Well I can only say something, jQuery is VERY powerful
[15:54:23] <mathi> thank you
[15:54:33] <LordThumper> even though its only a wrapper of sorts
[15:54:47] <BinaryKitten> kamo is that a jQuery issue?
[15:54:49] <Eviltwin> klafka: I see an "Update" with the fix
[15:54:55] <cups> eviltwin   would the event be 'load' or 'onload'
[15:55:05] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: The proper term is "framework"
[15:55:07] <BinaryKitten> cups "load"
[15:55:24] <cups> if I do $(img).bind('load', function(){console.log('img loaded')}),     is that right?
[15:55:32] <BinaryKitten> .one
[15:55:35] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: And frameworks are designed around making something that was possible (but maybe tedious) before easier
[15:55:47] <Eviltwin> cups: $(img).one instead of $(img).bind
[15:55:49] <kamo> BinaryKitten: Yes I am setting the value on the dropdown with jQuery
[15:56:01] <cups> ok let me read up on one thanks
[15:56:01] <kamo> But only default value is in the box
[15:56:08] <daftcode> Hi guys.. i'm stuck on a thingy with the jQuery Countdown plugin - I want to make a timer that counts to the next day 00:00 hour (12 'o clock) http://keith-wood.name/countdownRef.html but i can't manage to get it working
[15:56:27] <BinaryKitten> kamo how are you "select"ing the value?
[15:56:28] <Eviltwin> kamo: This says resolved
[15:56:37] <Eviltwin> kamo: Can you make a jsFiddle that shows that's not working?
[15:57:01] <kamo> BinaryKitten: No I cannot
[15:57:14] <BinaryKitten> kamo how are you "select"ing the value?
[15:57:58] <kamo> $("#dropdown").val(optionvaluefromjson)
[15:58:29] <Eviltwin> kamo: Give us code
[15:58:30] <kamo> BinryKitten: $("#dropdown").val(optionvaluefromjson);
[15:58:39] <BinaryKitten> kamo now can you put your code on jsFiddle...
[15:58:43] <Eviltwin> A demonstration of the problem at jsFiddle is deal
[15:58:45] <Eviltwin> ideal*
[15:58:56] <BinaryKitten> html with the select and all options
[15:59:00] <kamo> okk I will get that ready
[15:59:01] <BinaryKitten> an the js,
[15:59:13] * BinaryKitten huggles Eviltwin
[15:59:34] <Eviltwin> I wish bot-t was around
[15:59:38] <Eviltwin> I set some useful triggers
[15:59:51] <BinaryKitten> something like peace?
[16:00:31] <Eviltwin> cik
[16:01:03] <Eviltwin> "Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net"
[16:01:48] <kamo> BinaryKitten: here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/kamobagula/sVJJf/1/
[16:02:12] <Eviltwin> kamo: And what's not working?
[16:02:49] <kamo> Will not switch the displayed value in FireFox
[16:02:53] <BinaryKitten> kamo as Eviltwin just said, how is that not working...
[16:03:12] * BinaryKitten fires up the fox
[16:03:18] <kamo> Actually FF 3.5-9
[16:03:27] <daftcode> Guys, how do i get the current time + 24 hours? I've been struggling with this code - but getHours doesnt seem to be a proper thing, right? http://jsfiddle.net/tDPqF/1/
[16:03:56] <daftcode> well better said.. how do i get the date - untill 00:00 hours (12 o clock)
[16:05:36] <kamo> BinaryKitten what do you think? Crazy eh?
[16:05:39] <BinaryKitten> Kamo it works
[16:05:48] <BinaryKitten> you only need the .val line
[16:05:52] <BinaryKitten> the others are pointless
[16:06:09] <BinaryKitten> with the 1st one Firefox does indeed not do what you want.
[16:06:24] <BinaryKitten> but with just .val it works fine
[16:06:46] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/sVJJf/2/
[16:07:08] <BinaryKitten> selects Germany in Firefox 7.0.1
[16:07:11] <kamo> Yeah but the implementation is the page load of session saved filter settings
[16:07:20] <BinaryKitten> ??
[16:08:11] <kamo> Multiple dropdowns the resulte are loaded into them
[16:08:37] <kamo> By a JSON webservice
[16:08:57] <BinaryKitten> there's your issue then
[16:09:25] <BinaryKitten> check the fire time of the code over the upate time
[16:09:45] <BinaryKitten> daftcode  new Date.setDate(new Date().getDate() +1);
[16:10:39] <daftcode> BinaryKitten:  i was just trying that, thanks :)
[16:11:07] <BinaryKitten> though that won't get midnight
[16:11:11] <Eviltwin> kamo: Also, I think using .removeProp and .prop instead of .remoteAttr and .attr fixes it too
[16:11:45] <BinaryKitten> Eviltwin yeah agreed, especially in the new versions
[16:11:56] <BinaryKitten> I completely forgot about that divergance
[16:12:08] <Eviltwin> I still don't fully understand it
[16:12:29] <kamo> Me niether
[16:12:46] <BinaryKitten> Eviltwin  dom element has attr,  dom element object version has property
[16:12:47] <kamo> They look the same
[16:13:16] <Eviltwin> BinaryKitten: Is it the difference between element.getAttribute("value") and element.value ?
[16:13:39] <BinaryKitten> yes
[16:13:49] <Eviltwin> K, that's what I figured
[16:13:53] <kamo> ok more detail here
[16:13:55] <Eviltwin> But I guess I don't always know when to use which :P
[16:14:14] <BinaryKitten> depends on what is changed Eviltwin
[16:14:18] <BinaryKitten> eg on a checkbox..
[16:14:25] <BinaryKitten> the checked attribute never changed
[16:14:30] <BinaryKitten> but the property does
[16:14:35] <Eviltwin> RIght
[16:14:39] <BinaryKitten> same with selected
[16:14:41] <Eviltwin> But I mean setting wise
[16:15:07] <BinaryKitten> in the end setting doesn't matter, but unsetting does
[16:15:23] <Eviltwin> Oh, I see
[16:15:27] <kamo> That makes sense
[16:15:30] <BinaryKitten> unsetting the attribute doesn't unset the property, but setting the attribute changes the property
[16:15:39] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, thanks for the code... I ask myself if I can apply sortable stuff to any element. Why not linking it to "li" - because ul is some sort of the container!?!?
[16:16:10] <BinaryKitten> RedFox2  ul isn't block level
[16:16:18] <daftcode> This wont work right?  var Tomorrow = new Date.setDate(new Date().getDate() +1);
[16:16:31] <BinaryKitten> daftcode no
[16:16:37] <kamo> Thanks again you two
[16:16:42] <Eviltwin> This is one of the differences I know of: http://jsfiddle.net/pz7B4/
[16:16:43] <BinaryKitten> daftcode var Tomorrow = new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() +1);
[16:16:46] <RedFox2> how long do jsfiddle snippets stay?
[16:16:47] <kamo> Good day to you
[16:16:53] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: Months
[16:16:59] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: And you get to chew on it now
[16:17:02] <Eviltwin> And read up on sortable
[16:17:05] <RedFox2> ok thx
[16:17:07] <RedFox2> kk thx
[16:17:08] <Eviltwin> I'm done with your issue
[16:17:16] <RedFox2> yes, thanks for it
[16:17:17] <daftcode> BinaryKitten: thanks, so it had to be a function
[16:17:24] <BinaryKitten> no
[16:17:25] <RedFox2> you gave me all the important snippets
[16:17:33] <RedFox2> and cool examples
[16:17:37] <BinaryKitten> daftcode Date = object
[16:17:43] <Eviltwin> RedFox2: Yes, a lot more than just snippets :P
[16:17:44] <BinaryKitten> new Object()
[16:17:44] <daftcode> ah right
[16:17:52] <RedFox2> jquery kungfoo
[16:17:53] <RedFox2> :D
[16:19:09] * Eviltwin afks for dinner
[16:19:11] <Eviltwin> TTYL
[16:19:27] <RedFox2> bon appetite
[16:20:51] <ohcibi> is it possible to recursiveley search through the left-siblings of the current element?
[16:20:53] * BinaryKitten afks to go die in a corner somewhere... or possibly just be ill some more
[16:23:50] <daftcode> mmh still cant figure out how i can count to tomorrow 00:00 o clock

[17:01:47] <imsky> because TAOCP has the "unfinished" reputation
[17:01:52] <coldhead> concrete math
[17:01:56] <lilmikey> you were calling the variable fieldset from within ''
[17:02:03] <coldhead> i don't care about the art

[17:02:27] <imsky> concretes
[17:02:27] <nicolasDas>  i have this code: http://pastie.org/3055073 how can i get the obj var outside the function?
[17:02:32] <lilmikey> because its a variable
[17:02:46] <lilmikey> if you put it in parenthesis, jquery will think its an element
[17:02:48] <mohi666> long time ago I read somewhere that json objects with depth level of one are not good. Any idea if this was a valid statement?
[17:03:15] <abjorn> nicolasDas: Declare it outside the function then
[17:03:20] <abjorn> just
[17:03:22] <lilmikey> its still wrong i think
[17:03:23] <abjorn> not at a global
[17:03:27] <abjorn> *as a
[17:03:35] <nicolasDas> abjorn: doesn't works
[17:03:36] <lilmikey> but at least now it outputs only two buttons
[17:03:44] <abjorn> what doesn't work
[17:03:51] <abjorn> give me an example of what you tried that doesn't work
[17:03:58] <yan_nick> lilmikey: it is an element
[17:04:05] <yan_nick> yes, it's wrong :c
[17:04:13] <yan_nick> lilmikey: but hold on
[17:04:26] <yan_nick> lilmikey: don'T save a new fiddle, i prepare a new cleaner fiddle first okay?
[17:04:28] <nicolasDas> http://pastie.org/3055090 this abjorn
[17:04:33] <lilmikey> yea
[17:04:41] <yan_nick> lilmikey: cause of the img tags and so on
[17:04:55] <abjorn> how doesn't that work, nicolasDas
[17:04:55] <lilmikey> in the meantime: can some1 take a look at this please: $('#wtff-profile-picture-form'+fieldset).each(function(i)
[17:04:58] <abjorn> what part of it doesn't work
[17:05:07] <lilmikey> sory
[17:05:29] <imsky> TEK SAPPORT
[17:05:34] <lilmikey> i meant: http://jsfiddle.net/k3pHX/
[17:06:11] <abjorn> imsky: rite?
[17:06:50] <imsky> lol
[17:06:57] <imsky> i don't really get how you can go from your 9-to-5
[17:07:03] <imsky> and right into free tek sapport
[17:07:20] <imsky> kinda exhausting to even think about it
[17:07:44] <luchenbill> could anyone help me out with some logic ideas please on this: http://jsfiddle.net/tMCgZ/1/
[17:08:37] <nicolasDas> abjorn when i do an alert(obj) it says undefined
[17:09:12] <abjorn> try seeing what data is in that function :3
[17:09:25] <abjorn> wait
[17:09:29] <abjorn> when are you doing alert(obj)
[17:09:33] <abjorn> in the function?
[17:09:49] <yan_nick> lilmikey: cleaner http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/aQ5jn/2/ :)
[17:09:49] <imsky> wubwubwub
[17:10:11] <yan_nick> lilmikey: http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/aQ5jn/3/
[17:10:20] <yan_nick> lilmikey: and now we have the same problem
[17:10:25] <dbugger> Hey guys. Im trying to add some markup with append and immediately animate it, like "append('<div class="new"></div>').animate("top":20);" but its not working. What should I do?
[17:10:27] <yan_nick> but it's easier to debug
[17:10:51] <lilmikey> http://jsfiddle.net/k3pHX/ look through mine ill look through yours
[17:11:51] <abjorn> imsky: my friend is working on his 2d skeletal system for his game. It's not going so well http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11911775/pics/GaiaPulsePreviewer-0100.png
[17:12:24] <imsky> lol
[17:12:26] <imsky> lrn2ik
[17:12:29] <nicolasDas> abjorn: outside the function, inside works like a charm
[17:12:38] <luchenbill> any ideas :|
[17:12:43] <destryalhmns> yay
[17:12:48] <destryalhmns> hello everyone
[17:12:51] <imsky> hello!
[17:13:09] <destryalhmns> didnt even think to join this channel until just now
[17:13:17] <imsky> #jquery is pretty tits
[17:13:36] <imsky> abjorn: also red aero? kinda ugly
[17:13:42] <yan_nick> can anybody can help me to find the mistake here? http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/aQ5jn/3/
[17:13:45] <destryalhmns> ive been doing jquery mobile lately
[17:13:52] <abjorn> nicolasDas: Well then that's obvious. It's because it IS undefined at the point which you do the alert(). AJAX is called ajax for a reason, it's asynchronous. When you make the $.post it's not going to wait until it's done before going on with the program
[17:14:15] <abjorn> 'obj' will only be set when that function has been called, after the request returns
[17:14:19] <luchenbill> could anyone help me out with some logic ideas please on this: http://jsfiddle.net/tMCgZ/1/ I'm new to jquery and I have no idea where to begin... it's just a div when you click on those buttons it will scroll the div...
[17:14:58] <nicolasDas> well... i'm just trying to get the json data sent from php
[17:15:07] <dbugger> Can someone tell me why this box isnt animating? http://jsfiddle.net/4QcpE/
[17:15:40] <nicolasDas> abjorn im just trying to get the json data sent from php with json_encode
[17:16:22] <abjorn> well yes i realize that
[17:16:23] <destryalhmns> looking at the box..
[17:16:30] <destryalhmns> NO PUN INTENDED HA HA HA
[17:16:30] <lilmikey> yan_nick
[17:16:45] <yan_nick> lilmikey: yeah?
[17:16:51] <lilmikey> your code executes 3 times
[17:16:56] <imsky> dbugger: lot of code left out there buddy
[17:17:07] <abjorn> lol I have this $25 gift certificate to best buy from work and nothing to use it on.
[17:17:08] <lilmikey> and each time it outputs two buttons for
[17:17:16] <yan_nick> lilmikey: but why?
[17:17:20] <dbugger> imsky, what am I missing? I thought that should work
[17:17:33] <yan_nick> lilmikey: i use the index as identifier
[17:17:33] <lilmikey> the two fieldsets that dont have
[17:17:45] <yan_nick> lilmikey: so that this can be only one item per loop
[17:17:45] <imsky> dbugger: http://jsfiddle.net/4QcpE/1/
[17:17:48] <lilmikey> a parent with id current picture
[17:17:57] <destryalhmns> need to verify but it looks like youre trying to animate the outer box
[17:18:08] <destryalhmns> ill have a real answer hopefully in a second
[17:18:23] <lilmikey> you only need one loop.
[17:18:27] <nicolasDas> abjorn so how this should be done?
[17:18:36] <yan_nick> lilmikey: so how would you do that?
[17:18:40] <yan_nick> in a shorter way?
[17:19:00] <abjorn> That's a very broad question, nicolasDas, considering I have no context into what you're really trying to do with this data.
[17:19:04] <lilmikey> from the code i see you want to have four buttons, right?
[17:19:07] <lilmikey> or only two?
[17:19:13] <abjorn> Put up a more specific example to jsfiddle and we can help
[17:19:27] <nicolasDas> i then need to pass it to a chart library :), highcharts
[17:19:29] <dbugger> imsky, oh wow! I see!
[17:19:32] <dbugger> thanks!
[17:19:36] <imsky> yw
[17:19:44] <abjorn> Then do that in the function, nicolasDas
[17:19:48] <nicolasDas> just getting it outside the the function will do.. so i can process it later
[17:19:55] <imsky> abjorn: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Kingston+Technology+-+16GB+microSDHC+Class+4+Memory+Card/2731247.p?id=1218347174375&skuId=2731247
[17:19:56] <yan_nick> lilmikey: two
[17:20:01] <lilmikey> k wait
[17:20:07] <yan_nick> lilmikey: for each field set one
[17:20:09] <imsky> 16 giglobytes on your phone
[17:20:12] <abjorn> but I have one of those
[17:20:16] <imsky> loal
[17:20:22] <destryalhmns> also, looks like the css is all messed up
[17:20:25] <abjorn> it's kingston two
[17:20:29] <abjorn> that exact one
[17:20:30] <abjorn> lol
[17:20:35] <imsky> legit mates
[17:20:35] <destryalhmns> give me a minute and ill show you how a man does it

[17:25:20] <lilmikey> dude wait!

[17:28:56] <Eviltwin> destryalhmns: Excessive doc readies
[17:28:59] <lilmikey> yan_nick
[17:29:08] <destryalhmns> imsky you sober bastard, you got it before me, and in one line.... you bastard
[17:29:16] <lilmikey> i got it - well close enough
[17:29:26] <imsky> destryalhmns: cheers mate
[17:29:29] <lilmikey> but you didnt even take a look at my code
[17:29:33] * destryalhmns high five
[17:29:37] <imsky> \o
[17:29:39] <yan_nick> lilmikey: yeah
[17:29:51] <lilmikey> so either you do that or im not posting it.
[17:30:34] <yan_nick> lilmikey: but i cannot access the +fieldset variable in the foreach :S
[17:31:22] <lilmikey> http://jsfiddle.net/k3pHX/ i mean this one
[17:31:41] <destryalhmns> you say excessive doc readys, i say a good general wins a battle before the fight begins..
[17:31:57] <Eviltwin> leehinde: Why are there loops involved?
[17:32:08] <yan_nick> lilmikey: why do i need that?
[17:32:13] <Eviltwin> Err
[17:32:15] <Eviltwin> lilmikey
[17:32:44] <lilmikey> Eviltwin?
[17:32:49] <yan_nick> it cannot be so difficult to get http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/aQ5jn/3/ working right or?
[17:32:50] <geoinfogeeknet> $.getJSON("test.js",function(result){ .......... works flawlessly on localhost, but $.getJSON("http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/demo_ajax_json.js",function(result){ ...... does not
[17:33:03] <geoinfogeeknet> any idea?
[17:33:04] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: You linked a jsFiddle with for loops
[17:33:05] <imsky> lol?
[17:33:08] <yan_nick> geoinfogeeknet: securety reason?
[17:33:13] <Eviltwin> ?sop @ geoinfogeeknet
[17:33:17] <Eviltwin> Ugh

[17:33:23] <yan_nick> security*

[17:33:35] <imsky> NOOOOoooo
[17:33:37] <yan_nick> ?each
[17:33:54] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: geoinfogeeknet needs jsonp or?
[17:34:14] <Eviltwin> Or a proxy hosted on his server
[17:34:16] <yan_nick> or he could try to get the content via php :)
[17:34:21] <Eviltwin> Or rather the domain the page is on
[17:34:33] <geoinfogeeknet> is that a cross-domain issue?
[17:34:45] <Eviltwin> Yes
[17:34:50] <Eviltwin> You are violating the same origin policy
[17:35:00] <yan_nick> lilmikey: why did you send the fiddle?
[17:35:06] <yan_nick> lilmikey: dunno what do you mean :s
[17:35:13] <lilmikey> because i needed help on my code
[17:35:15] <leehinde> I was looking at jquery.mustache.js and I saw this line:     var _trim = String.prototype.trim, trim;   and I'm curious what the ', trim' is doing
[17:35:31] <lilmikey> sorry dude. i thought youd try to help me out because i was trying to fix your code
[17:35:47] <yan_nick> lilmikey: oh
[17:35:55] <destryalhmns> lol
[17:35:58] <geoinfogeeknet> ok, but i've runned on localhost another script with a flickr json
[17:36:01] <yan_nick> lilmikey: i thought i should take a look on your fiddle to find my error
[17:36:07] <geoinfogeeknet> without any problem
[17:36:09] <lilmikey> no, my error
[17:36:11] <lilmikey> nevermind.
[17:36:14] <danheberden> leehinde mdn is down but http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Jz2nSPTwdfIJ:https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
[17:36:16] <yan_nick> :s
[17:36:20] <lilmikey> Eviltwin: what about that for loop?
[17:36:27] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: Why is it there?
[17:36:38] <lilmikey> jesus.
[17:36:49] <danzik17> no bot-t and no MDN?  oh. my. god.
[17:37:19] <lilmikey> well, i needed to compare three elements with three array items
[17:37:23] <yan_nick> danzik17: suicid?
[17:37:24] <danheberden> it was foretold - bot-t and mdn are the king of the north
[17:37:28] <lilmikey> so i thought id do a for loop for each item
[17:37:37] <leehinde> thanks dan,  what I was curious about was what sort of thing was created with a comma delimited argument list when assigning to a var.
[17:37:39] <danheberden> i blame kim jong il
[17:38:05] <yan_nick> so what to do now? any other ideas why my fiddle generates 3x two buttons? http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/aQ5jn/3/
[17:38:19] <danzik17> danheberden: wait, are you saying bot-t was kim jong il?  it doesn't seem like a coincidence that he dies and bot-t just dissapears.
[17:38:25] <danheberden> leehinde it's making multiple vars - `var foo = "what?!", bar = "omg", baz;`
[17:38:31] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: http://jsfiddle.net/9VhGW/
[17:38:34] <yan_nick> danzik17: or the bot is currently looking at things :D
[17:38:44] <Eviltwin> lilmikey: Why might what I wrote be considered illogical?
[17:38:46] <danheberden> so foo === "what?!", bar === "omg" and baz === undefined
[17:39:33] <geoinfogeeknet> how can getjson() on localhost process a Flickr json but can't process a www.whatever.com json?
[17:39:47] <Eviltwin> geoinfogeeknet: Same. Origin. Policy.
[17:39:55] <Eviltwin> geoinfogeeknet: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[17:39:56] <lilmikey> eviltwin, im not getting into this.
[17:40:07] <leehinde> ah, ok. Thanks.
[17:40:09] <danheberden> geoinfogeeknet magical settings
[17:40:12] <yan_nick> hmpf so simple :c
[17:40:22] <velts_> can someone tell me the difference between $('a.button', $('#container')); and $('#container').find('a.button') ?
[17:40:32] <snover> the first one is dumb as hell
[17:40:37] <snover> there’s that
[17:40:37] <geoinfogeeknet> merci
[17:40:48] <Eviltwin> velts_: they should produce the same result
[17:40:49] <danzik17> velts_: the latter looks prettier and perofmr slightly better.  other than that, nothing.
[17:40:57] <danzik17> performs*
[17:41:31] <velts_> ok thanks
[17:41:39] <Eviltwin> danzik17: You're sure that find performs better?
[17:42:01] <danzik17> Eviltwin: positive.  internally it just delegates to .find, so there's some really minor amount of overhead.
[17:43:25] <destryalhmns> speaking of overhead
[17:43:44] <yan_nick> hmpf forgot to remove the via js generated buttons … but still not working http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/aQ5jn/5/
[17:43:47] <Eviltwin> danzik17: http://jsperf.com/context-vs-find-2
[17:44:00] <Eviltwin> danzik17: Slight enough for jsperf to not care
[17:44:15] <danzik17> Eviltwin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L165-166 .  im not disagreeing, just saying its there.
[17:44:23] <destryalhmns> i did a test recently, that computed a random number between 1 and 1 million. i made the exact same program in js and c#, it was 5x as fast in js
[17:44:38] <yan_nick> i even get two fieldsets http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/aQ5jn/5/ how can i get only the right one?
[17:44:40] <destryalhmns> even with the process set to high priority in c#
[17:45:45] <Eviltwin> danzik17: Yeah, I see
[17:46:53] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Only the "right" one?
[17:47:20] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: when you click "upload photo" you should only get the "upload photo" field set and the same for existing photos
[17:47:32] <Mayank> Hi, If I have  a function like - function someFunction () { .....something....}. Now I want to call this function and also define a callback for this function, how do i do it?
[17:48:05] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Where are you binding the click?
[17:48:34] <yan_nick> at the same where the button is appending to the choose-method
[17:48:55] <destryalhmns> provide a name of another function as the argument and then do thingInamed() at the end
[17:49:39] <lilmikey> http://jsfiddle.net/q2TMG/
[17:49:43] <destryalhmns> maybe, lol, or you might have to send an object
[17:49:49] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: hm?
[17:50:37] <Eviltwin> Oh, I see it
[17:50:56] <Eviltwin> profile_picture_form.children('.choose-method').append('<button id="choose-method-' + i + '">' + legend + '</button>').bind('click',?);
[17:51:03] <Eviltwin> What's it binding to?
[17:51:29] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: the "current" button
[17:51:41] <unidentified101> How do I send "this" to a function
[17:51:58] <unidentified101> if you need example let me know
[17:51:58] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: It binds to the result of .children('.choose-method') actually
[17:52:14] <Eviltwin> unidentified101: I think I know what you're talking about but it'd help to see to make sure
[17:52:19] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: no the button or?
[17:52:30] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: i append the button
[17:52:35] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: .append doesn't change the collection
[17:52:42] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: ;(
[17:53:13] <Eviltwin> You can rework to use appendTo or a different ordering
[17:53:18] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: http://jsfiddle.net/aQ5jn/6/
[17:53:51] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: ah! append to changes the collection cool :)
[17:54:01] <Eviltwin> appendTo doesn't change the collection
[17:54:08] <Eviltwin> But look at what collection we start with
[17:54:51] <Eviltwin> ?botsnack
[17:54:52] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: i don't know what you mean

[18:00:55] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: what is that?
[18:01:13] <Eviltwin> unidentified101: update.call(<this>, <pid>)
[18:01:31] <Eviltwin> Will make "this" be <this> and "pid" be <pid>

[18:02:00] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: An example of three different syntaxes for adding a new span to div#foo while applying a .css
[18:02:08] <unidentified101> ok with quotes?
[18:02:09] <Eviltwin> The first one targets the div
[18:02:12] <Eviltwin> The other two target the span
[18:02:17] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: ah!
[18:02:35] <Eviltwin> unidentified101: update.call($("input")[0],"4")

[18:19:33] <coldhead> andrrres: we prefer not to use PMs because then everyone can chime in with their clever/stupid comments
[18:19:52] <Crimlo> Pms are cool
[18:19:52] <Ghostman> colhead can you help me?
[18:20:01] <Crimlo> i prefer PMs
[18:20:04] <Ghostman> coldhead can you help me?
[18:20:08] <andrrres> coldhead that's sort'a why I wanted PM
[18:20:13] <coldhead> i don't know yet, Ghostman
[18:20:20] <coldhead> you aren't giving me much to go on
[18:20:23] <Crimlo> ghost don't waste your time, he's not that smart
[18:20:27] <Ghostman> of course,
[18:20:39] <andrrres> coldhead I'll put my code into pastebin to see if you can help at all
[18:20:48] <coldhead> lovely
[18:20:50] <Ghostman> it is the entire day that i'm looking on internet for an answer... :D
[18:20:56] <coldhead> althugh i have to warn you, i'm not that smart
[18:21:05] <coldhead> but i am filled with enthusiasm
[18:21:10] <coldhead> enthusiasm and despair
[18:21:18] <Crimlo> whats the damn question
[18:21:36] <Ghostman> i made a script in jquery to countdown, now, i would like to set the countdown time via php, and pass the variable to jquery...
[18:21:53] <Ghostman> so the question is how i can pass a variable from php to jquery?
[18:22:21] <Crimlo> thank i cannot help you with, i am a complete newbie
[18:23:08] <Ghostman> So, someone can give me a hint?
[18:23:12] <coldhead> there are a lot of different ways, Ghostman
[18:23:28] <coldhead> i'll do you a fiddle of the way i would do it
[18:24:07] <Ghostman> Coldhead, put me on the road and i will proceed alone !!
[18:24:36] <andrrres> coldhead, here's the file http://pastebin.com/uWb2BCy7 . The problem I'm having is that while both player function calls are executing, the 2nd instance of the player doesn't work. All of this was working before I made a separate jscript file for the code. Originally, it was all in the html file.
[18:25:19] <cpgo> is there a way to use .toggle(boolean) and an animation, or do I have to check myself and use show/hide
[18:25:54] <coldhead> Ghostman: http://jsfiddle.net/c66EN/
[18:25:56] <coldhead> something like that
[18:26:45] <andrrres> coldhead some of the code such as the stop_selected function isn't complete, so bear that in mind
[18:26:59] <Eviltwin> cpgo: http://jsfiddle.net/q2Dbf/
[18:27:34] <coldhead> andrrres: the first thing i wonder about is the $(this) on line 13
[18:27:41] <coldhead> i'm not sure what that this should be
[18:27:46] <coldhead> but i think it would be the wiindow
[18:28:00] <coldhead> Eviltwin would know such things if you can persuade him to look
[18:28:09] <andrrres> coldhead that's actually part of the original jplayer code
[18:28:20] <andrrres> are you think that it's getting confused now since it's in a separate file
[18:28:22] <coldhead> andrrres: no doubt, but you've put it in a different context
[18:28:28] <andrrres> yea
[18:28:39] <Ghostman> coldhead, so just include as a normal text variabile between <?> it that all?
[18:28:39] <coldhead> this is weird in js, it means different things in different places
[18:28:50] <andrrres> the first instance of the player works fine, but the 2nd doesn't
[18:28:58] <coldhead> Ghostman: if it's text then make it '<?= $var_name ?>'
[18:29:03] <andrrres> in fact right now, the first player plays both sound files...
[18:29:05] <coldhead> but yes, something liek that should work fine
[18:29:16] <muzone> hey hey
[18:29:23] <coldhead> andrrres: do you have this online somewhere?
[18:29:26] <coldhead> like a working demo?
[18:29:31] <coldhead> that would be a big help
[18:29:32] <andrrres> yea one sec
[18:29:36] <muzone> coldhead matter of fact i just put up one
[18:29:45] <andrrres> http://mysteronyx.com/music/covers/radionowhere/radionowhere.php
[18:30:02] <muzone> http://home.no/dwaynie/found_it.mp3
[18:30:24] <andrrres> as you'll see, the play selected button doesn't work (not sure why because it used to) and the 2nd player doesn't function. The first player plays both sound files when it should only play the guitar
[18:30:51] <Ghostman> thank you coldhead,
[18:31:55] <muzone> http://home.no/dwaynie/troublesound.mp3
[18:33:14] <coldhead> andrrres: ummm, you have $(document).ready() INSIDE another function
[18:33:31] <coldhead> i'm not sure what that's going to do
[18:33:45] <coldhead> but i'm sure it isn't right
[18:34:02] <andrrres> hmm I should just remove that
[18:34:06] <coldhead> if i were you i'd go back to the inline version that worked and start moving it out to JS again
[18:34:11] <coldhead> with #jQuery's help
[18:34:16] <andrrres> ok
[18:34:47] <cpgo> Eviltwin, thank you
[18:35:05] <cpgo> Eviltwin, does show change css displa value?
[18:35:11] <cpgo> show()
[18:36:53] <andrrres> coldhead i took the doc ready line out, and now it's saying Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null
[18:36:53] <andrrres> (anonymous function)
[18:37:37] <coldhead> andrrres: you probalbly DO want a document ready, but it should be outermost
[18:37:44] <andrrres> ahh alright
[18:37:48] <coldhead> it should wrap EVERYTHING
[18:37:55] <andrrres> ok
[18:38:02] <pythonirc1011> I'd like to have a nice information box that displays information about the webpage when "More Info" is clicked. What widget from jquery-ui should i use to do this?
[18:39:24] <coldhead> modal() maybe, pythonirc1011
[18:39:39] <coldhead> wait, it's called dialog()
[18:39:52] <coldhead> i've never used it but it's quite popular
[18:40:43] <pythonirc1011> coldhead: looking at it
[18:41:19] <pythonirc1011> coldhead: i like modal -- http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal-demos/ ?
[18:41:53] <coldhead> i like those too
[18:42:48] <coldhead> andrrres: i'm getting some lunch but #jQuery will assist you meanwhile
[18:42:57] <coldhead> or i'll kill everyone here
[18:43:02] <coldhead> i've done it before
[18:43:09] <andrrres> thank you, now I'm actually having a new problem since I switched that
[18:43:43] <andrrres> it's saying the function 'player' in the php file isn't defined, but I do define it in the jscript file
[18:44:13] <coldhead> do you load the JS first?
[18:44:18] <coldhead> before you use it in the PHP?
[18:44:34] <andrrres> yeah
[18:44:38] <andrrres> it's at the top
[18:44:57] <coldhead> can you show Eviltwin? link a fellow up <3
[18:45:00] <coldhead> brb
[18:45:05] <andrrres> ok
[18:46:16] <andrrres> Eviltwin, here is my pastebin: http://pastebin.com/DKpiE0n7
[18:46:36] <andrrres> The error I'm getting is that the player function is not defined in the html file
[18:47:03] <andrrres> this was working a few minutes ago before I moved the document.ready from inside a function to the outside
[18:49:58] <destryalhmns> christ all mighty i hate darkf
[18:50:42] <destryalhmns> anyhone at all on irc that likes attacking others and then getting another band of morons to agree, i despise
[18:51:05] <destryalhmns> so thats probably about 700 people in here
[18:51:57] <misc--> lol.
[18:52:13] <vladikoff> O_o
[18:56:53] <Eviltwin> cpgo: .show() does change the display value
[18:57:25] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Could you try making this as a jsFiddle?
[18:57:31] <Eviltwin> andrrres: So I can actually see the error happen
[18:57:36] <Eviltwin> Look at the stack trace tc.
[18:57:41] <Eviltwin> etc*
[18:57:43] <andrrres> sure

[19:00:37] <Eviltwin> andrrres: You have relative URLs here...
[19:01:15] <andrrres> I'm sorry what do you mean by relative URLs
[19:01:25] <Eviltwin> <script type="text/javascript" src="../../../js/jquery.jplayer.js"></script>
[19:01:30] <Eviltwin> The src
[19:01:35] <andrrres> is that bad?
[19:01:55] <Eviltwin> Well it means it's looking for jquery.jplayer.js on jsfiddle.net
[19:01:59] <Eviltwin> And I can promise you it's not there
[19:02:05] <andrrres> oh ok
[19:02:19] <andrrres> I'm gonna have to find the links
[19:02:37] <andrrres> unless I use the exact link from my website
[19:02:52] <andrrres> one second I'll update it
[19:04:47] <andrrres> http://jsfiddle.net/Thxyw/2/
[19:04:50] <andrrres> try that, Eviltwin
[19:08:59] <andrrres> hmm now I'm getting errors when I visit my site, saying URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration
[19:09:08] <andrrres> guess I'll have to switch back to the folders
[19:10:37] <Eviltwin> andrrres: http://jsfiddle.net/Thxyw/7/
[19:13:25] <andrrres> Eviltwin thank you for cleaning that up for me. Your edits make sense.
[19:13:56] <Eviltwin> I think your biggest problem
[19:14:08] <Eviltwin> Was doing the $("#jquery_player_" + $end).jPlayer
[19:14:14] <Eviltwin> Before you added the HTML for it
[19:14:52] <andrrres> why do you think that was a problem?
[19:16:09] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Because of how jQuery works
[19:16:38] <Eviltwin> $("a") build a collection of every A tag in the document when I run it
[19:16:42] <surfdue> Assuming $(this) is a link tag, inside of a li that contains a ul (Ex. <li><a>THIS</a><ul></ul></li>) how can I find the UL I tried $(this).parent().find('ul');
[19:16:50] <surfdue> evening Eviltwin your up late ;)
[19:17:19] <andrrres> Eviltwin hmm... I'm trying to learn jscript, jquery, and jplayer all at once... so I appreciate the help
[19:17:25] <Eviltwin> surfdue: A link tag or an A tag
[19:17:33] <surfdue> A
[19:17:35] <surfdue> Eviltwin: sorr.
[19:17:37] <surfdue> sorry*
[19:17:37] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Start here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[19:17:51] <surfdue> andrrres: oh gosh i wish you the best, jplayer
[19:18:03] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Then get to http://jqfundamentals.com/
[19:18:16] <surfdue> andrrres: you probably need to sit down and learn JS first, that was my mistake.. Now I am all funked up.
[19:18:26] <Eviltwin> I agree, surfdue is fucked up
[19:18:33] <surfdue> Eviltwin: I concur.
[19:18:35] <andrrres> thanks for those links Eviltwin. surfdue, I'm sorry to hear that
[19:18:50] <surfdue> andrrres: what? that I have funk? :)
[19:19:00] <andrrres> yea
[19:19:13] <andrrres> and that you forgot the other d in your name
[19:19:38] <surfdue> andrrres: why did I forget a D? If I forgot a D don't you think I would have changed it now after 9 years?
[19:19:49] <Eviltwin> surfdue: http://jsfiddle.net/jwd9P/
[19:19:54] <andrrres> Eviltwin, it's still giving me this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null
[19:20:09] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Then the element you're trying to get doesn't exist
[19:20:17] <andrrres> it was working before though
[19:20:19] <surfdue> Eviltwin: does it have to be an each?
[19:20:28] <Eviltwin> surfdue: That was just to show you
[19:20:29] <andrrres> before coldhead recommended I move the position of the document.ready line
[19:20:32] <surfdue> Eviltwin: hows the holidays looking for you? doing anything crazy, special, etc?
[19:20:44] <Eviltwin> surfdue: http://jsfiddle.net/jwd9P/1/
[19:20:55] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Nothing crazy or terribly special
[19:20:59] <Eviltwin> Family stuffs
[19:21:14] <surfdue> Eviltwin: the entire time I realized I did it correctly, however I was trying to call an attr display
[19:21:17] <surfdue> instead of css... -.-
[19:21:19] <surfdue> coffee?
[19:21:19] <andrrres> Eviltwin maybe I have to put a $(document).ready line to wrap around that jscript?
[19:21:30] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Sure
[19:21:36] <Eviltwin> ?tias
[19:21:43] <Eviltwin> Oh, great, the bot's gone
[19:21:47] <Eviltwin> (Try It And See)
[19:21:54] <surfdue> andrrres: $(function() { JSGOESHERE });
[19:22:46] <andrrres> hmm
[19:23:24] <andrrres> I added $(document).ready(function() { code } ); to the jscript
[19:23:37] <andrrres> but it still gives the error. I wonder why it worked before but not now
[19:23:56] <andrrres> all I'm trying to do is pass html code back into a div
[19:25:55] <Eviltwin> One of the most important things to understand about JavaScript is it's not really designed to operate on HTML
[19:26:04] <Eviltwin> It's designed to operate on the DOM tree

[19:29:11] <thebignoise> because ie8 amazingly enough doesnt support it
[19:29:16] <Eviltwin> Or get Killed for flooding rather
[19:30:23] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: IE supports .split...
[19:30:37] <surfdue> Eviltwin: i have a worse problem.
[19:30:50] <andrrres> Eviltwin do you have any recommendation on how I could get this to work again? All I want is for the jscript file to recognize a div in the html file and then send html to it
[19:30:51] <surfdue> using find, it recursively looks for ul's
[19:30:55] <surfdue> i only want to search one layer down
[19:30:59] <surfdue> what do i do?
[19:31:15] <andrrres> I could do php quite easily, but I figured I would just do one language
[19:31:17] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: hmmm idk what my issue is then -- location.hash.substring(2).split(',');
[19:31:35] <thebignoise> thats my line and it says doesnt support property or method
[19:31:36] <surfdue> Eviltwin: find('ul').first() ?
[19:31:50] <surfdue> thebignoise: really heh nice nick :)
[19:31:54] <Eviltwin> surfdue: .children('ul')
[19:32:03] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Sorry, it totally depends on the situation
[19:32:04] <surfdue> Eviltwin: is that more efficient then find('ul').first()
[19:32:06] <surfdue> because it works.
[19:32:15] <thebignoise> surfdue: haha thanks
[19:32:24] <surfdue> thebignoise: are the rumors true?
[19:32:54] <surfdue> thebignoise: your problem probably relies in location, is this a variable you set? By default this isnt a jquery variable.
[19:33:15] <surfdue> thebignoise: oops.. I just realized your using javascript functions. :P
[19:33:20] * surfdue headslams
[19:33:23] <surfdue> i tried.. <3
[19:33:29] <thebignoise> surfdue: there are rumors? lol
[19:33:34] <thebignoise> lol
[19:33:39] <surfdue> thebignoise: yes that your nose is big. :P
[19:33:40] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: Can you try something like this: http://pastebin.com/jTiXv5Cr
[19:33:49] <surfdue> thebignoise: rest assure, I am italian.
[19:33:52] <surfdue> :P
[19:33:54] <Eviltwin> And make sure its working at each step along the way
[19:33:58] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Yes
[19:34:01] <Eviltwin> It's more efficient
[19:34:16] <Eviltwin> And .find('ul').first() doesn't guarantee it's an immediate child
[19:34:19] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: ah good plan thank you
[19:34:37] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: console.log is better if you know how to do that
[19:34:48] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: yuppers
[19:35:02] <surfdue> Eviltwin: dude.. you gotta pm me this project is lookin sick
[19:35:05] <surfdue> i think you would like it
[19:35:15] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: console.log("a",a) instead
[19:35:19] <Eviltwin> No need to concatenate there
[19:35:46] <andrrres> I'm guessing the document id is returning null because I'm no longer calling a function within the html file
[19:35:52] <Eviltwin> surfdue: I've got more than enough work of my own right now actually
[19:35:58] <andrrres> if I call it again it might work
[19:36:15] <Eviltwin> andrrres: It's almost certainly something to do with the getElementById returning null
[19:36:23] <Eviltwin> I would play with that and see if you can figure it out
[19:36:35] <thebignoise> http://pastebin.com/jTiXv5Cr
[19:36:41] <thebignoise> oops forget that
[19:36:41] <thebignoise> lol
[19:36:48] <Eviltwin> Heh
[19:36:59] <thebignoise> everything works fine
[19:37:04] <thebignoise> it crys when i try to assign the var to it
[19:37:44] <thebignoise> what is the difference between: var test
[19:37:47] <thebignoise> and just test
[19:37:54] <thebignoise> is var test more of an instance variable?
[19:38:50] <andrrres> bingo, got it to work
[19:39:27] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: var test means its in this scope
[19:39:33] <Eviltwin> Just test means its a global variable (in the window)
[19:39:40] <thebignoise> ohh duh
[19:39:42] <Eviltwin> Or the parent-most scope
[19:41:20] <surfdue> Eviltwin: not asking you to help. I am asking you to take a look and give me your opinion
[19:41:26] <surfdue> I will give you the service for free for live if you do :)
[19:41:39] <surfdue> the world ends in 2012 anyways.. but whatevr
[19:43:09] <Eviltwin> surfdue: I'll take a look at it I guess
[19:44:06] <Eviltwin> Unless its loaded with viruses
[19:44:12] <surfdue> of course not.
[19:44:15] <surfdue> use chrome virus free.
[19:47:47] <andrrres> everytime I try to call an external function, it says it's not defined. Any idea why?
[19:48:05] <andrrres> it's as if you can't actually communicate with external javascripts
[19:48:39] <LordThumper> Make sure the name is right
[19:48:42] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Are the external functions wrapped in a doc ready or something?
[19:48:44] <LordThumper> JS is case senstive
[19:48:49] <LordThumper> sensitive*
[19:48:53] <andrrres> Eviltwin they were, yea
[19:49:11] <Eviltwin> If they're inside a function, they become part of a separate scope
[19:49:16] <CantUnplug> andrrres are the calls / functions being loaded prior to you calling them?
[19:49:17] <Eviltwin> Nothing outside that scope can access them
[19:50:00] <andrrres> I took them out of the doc ready, and it did work, but it still said function not defined
[19:50:05] <andrrres> CantUnplug yeah
[19:50:41] <andrrres> well, CantUnplug, the function's js file is being called at the top of the html file
[19:50:57] <andrrres> so I presume that means the functions are being loaded from the start
[19:51:35] <CantUnplug> if the JS is being run (doc ready etc.. or even proceedural) the function itself should appear first somewhere
[19:51:46] <CantUnplug> dump your code theroguh jslint
[19:53:08] <andrrres> CantUnplug, http://jsfiddle.net/srFCD/
[19:53:38] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Notice on the left hand side, by Choose Framework, the "onLoad"
[19:53:58] <andrrres> yes I see that
[19:53:59] <Eviltwin> That means all of your JavaScript there is automatically wrapped in a $(window).load(function() { ... })
[19:54:14] <andrrres> oh no good
[19:54:29] <andrrres> should I pick no wrap (head)?
[19:54:32] <Eviltwin> Yep
[19:54:37] <andrrres> ok thanks
[19:55:33] <andrrres> CantUnplug here is an updated version: http://jsfiddle.net/srFCD/2/
[19:55:43] <CantUnplug> andrrres player is not defined.. is this right? "../../../test2.js"
[19:55:58] <andrrres> yeah
[19:56:02] <andrrres> that's my problem
[19:56:13] <andrrres> err sorry I put the relative UrLs back in
[19:56:33] <andrrres> all of test2.js is in that javascript window, though
[19:57:47] <Eviltwin> andrrres: ace cloud9
[19:57:48] <Eviltwin> Err
[19:57:52] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/srFCD/3/
[19:58:06] <Eviltwin> I fixed it
[19:58:26] <Eviltwin> The functions you're calling need to not be in the $(document).ready
[19:58:40] <CantUnplug> http://jsfiddle.net/srFCD/2/
[19:58:42] <Eviltwin> But the functions manipulate the document
[19:58:43] <CantUnplug> there you go
[19:58:51] <Eviltwin> So they can't be called until after the document is ready
[19:58:53] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[19:59:39] <andrrres> yeah it makes sense, I guess I just didn't understand why I couldn't communicate with it after it was ready
[19:59:47] <CantUnplug> its still a load issue.. your in-line js is runnign before the dependencies loaded
[19:59:55] <CantUnplug> wran in an onready etc to avoid this
[19:59:57] <andrrres> oh ok
[20:00:04] <andrrres> thanks I appreciate the help
[20:00:05] <CantUnplug> *wrap
[20:00:45] <andrrres> sorry cantplug I'm not seeing your updates
[20:00:56] <Eviltwin> andrrres: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.closures
[20:01:09] <CantUnplug> http://jsfiddle.net/srFCD/2/
[20:01:14] <CantUnplug> here.. check again
[20:01:33] <CantUnplug> i just wrapped your head script with a doc,ready
[20:01:42] <CantUnplug> it will wiat for externals to laod before running
[20:01:51] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Or http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.scopes
[20:02:10] <andrrres> great thanks
[20:02:16] <CantUnplug> http://jsfiddle.net/srFCD/4/
[20:02:19] <CantUnplug> sorry, i didnt save
[20:02:37] <andrrres> haha I thought I was going crazy
[20:03:01] <andrrres> strange, that's exactly what I had before
[20:04:22] <andrrres> now the next trick is to figure out why it's only playing the 2nd sound file and not the first
[20:04:32] <andrrres> along with why the 2nd player doesn't work
[20:05:42] <CantUnplug> not familiar with that plugin, but my guess would be namespace conflict.. where its resetting itself on the second pass
[20:06:18] <andrrres> I'll start with that
[20:07:55] <_xor> I have a situation where a page could have multiple functions that would need to be called from the document.ready event.  What's the best method to chain this?
[20:08:37] <_xor> The only obvious solution that jumps to my mind is to save the current function, load the new function into document.ready, and then at the end of my function call the old function.
[20:08:47] <Eviltwin> _xor: Can you explain with a code example?
[20:08:56] <gloomer> ya, bit confused by your statement
[20:08:56] <_xor> Sure. Give me a second.
[20:09:02] <gloomer> seems you could just call them both from document.ready
[20:09:23] <_xor> Yeah, that would be ideal.  Here's a more detail description of the situation.
[20:10:12] <_xor> I'm using a server-side MVC framework.  The main document layout has some jquery plugins that are called on every page once the document is loaded.  This is mainly for layout effects such as tickers or menu effects or whatnot.
[20:10:28] <_xor> Then there are the page-specific snippets that only run for a given page.
[20:10:50] <_xor> The way it's laid out on the server side, those two snippets of code are kept in seperate files (the layout file and the view file)
[20:11:16] <_xor> Each of those snippets have code that is meant to run when triggered by document.ready.
[20:11:27] <CantUnplug> they can all be in their own document.ready
[20:11:32] <_xor> orly?
[20:11:41] <Eviltwin> Yup
[20:11:48] <CantUnplug> yeah, jquery queues them
[20:11:49] <_xor> Hmm, I did not know this.
[20:11:50] <Eviltwin> You can have as many $(document).ready's as you like
[20:11:54] <CantUnplug> and runs in order of appearance
[20:11:57] <_xor> Oh nice, I didn't know it queued them.
[20:12:00] * _xor slaps his forehead
[20:12:05] <_xor> I should have looked at the source first heh :)
[20:12:13] <_xor> (...or read the docs more closely and more recently lol)
[20:12:23] <Behi> I am trying to create a reusable dialog that its ok event handler can be overriden, but looks like it's not working. Any ideas what's wrong with my code: http://jsfiddle.net/J3XRA/
[20:12:27] <CantUnplug> or just drop a console message in each and see them run in order
[20:12:28] <_xor> I thought it would just have a single event handler that got overwritten lol.
[20:12:41] <Behi> It should show an alert, bit it isn't
[20:12:50] <CantUnplug> document.ready just subscribes to the ready event
[20:12:57] <CantUnplug> when it fires all subscribers do their thing
[20:13:05] <_xor> Hahah oh man, now I feel like a doofus.  In my previous app (just a personal one thankfully), I was doing this...
[20:13:56] <_xor> I had a master.js script file that set the handler.  That handler would do the global stuff for every page.  Then at the end it would check for the existance of a function "if (typeof somefunc == 'function') { somefunc(); }"
[20:13:57] <Eviltwin> Behi: The problem is with your syntax in confirmDialog
[20:14:02] <Eviltwin> var buttons = confirmDialog.dialog('option', 'buttons')
[20:14:06] <Eviltwin> buttons['OK'] = function () {
[20:14:11] <Eviltwin> It doesn't work that way
[20:14:19] <_xor> Then each page-local script would simply declare somefunc() if it needed it.
[20:14:21] <_xor> lol
[20:14:25] <Eviltwin> I don't think
[20:14:34] <Behi> Eviltwin what's the correct way to do it?
[20:15:38] <CantUnplug> confirmDialog.dialog({buttons: ....);
[20:15:40] <Eviltwin> Behi: that basically gets a copy of the buttons
[20:15:48] <Eviltwin> Then you need to store it back
[20:15:57] <Eviltwin> Behi: http://jsfiddle.net/J3XRA/1/
[20:16:18] <CantUnplug> $( ".selector" ).dialog( "option", "buttons", { "Ok": function() { $(this).dialog("close"); } } );
[20:16:34] <CantUnplug> you need to pass it in the construct of the plugin
[20:16:34] <Behi> Eviltwin: thanks, I thought it's returning a reference...
[20:16:35] <Eviltwin> CantUnplug: He just wants to replace one of the buttons
[20:16:52] <CantUnplug> ah.. ok
[20:16:54] <Eviltwin> Behi: It kind of is but the widget doesn't necessarily respect it unless you set it this way
[20:17:08] <Eviltwin> Behi: This way the widget's code is notified of the change
[20:17:24] <andrrres> anyone here really good with jplayer?
[20:17:24] <Eviltwin> And actually I think it does copy
[20:17:29] <Eviltwin> andrrres: Heh, no
[20:18:00] <andrrres> I really appreciate the help you guys have given me tonight. My problem isn't entirely fixed, but I'm at a better place than before
[20:18:18] <Eviltwin> I'd say you're significantly further along, yes
[20:18:28] <Eviltwin> The rest seems to be mostly jPlayer-related issues
[20:18:32] <Eviltwin> Where I really can't help you
[20:18:39] <CantUnplug> andrrres http://www.jplayer.org/1.1.0/demo-03/
[20:18:58] <CantUnplug> if thats what you are goign for anyway
[20:19:04] <andrrres> yeah I had it working just fine, CantUnplug
[20:19:19] <andrrres> it was all within the html file, so tonight I decided to tease it out into a jscript file
[20:19:34] <andrrres> once I did that, i couldn't get the second player to work
[20:21:13] <Behi> Eviltwin overall, do you think it makes sense to reuse the dialog like this? And is there a more intuitive/readable way to override the callback if we want to reuse the dialog?
[20:23:52] <Eviltwin> Behi: Let me take a stab
[20:27:29] <Behi> Eviltwin thanks :)
[20:28:48] <LordThumper> Ok I need to apply after("<tag></tag>") only to new elements created dynamically. Obviously calling the method again will apply another pass to older elements
[20:30:44] <riyonuk> Can someone tell me why I should do $(document) instead of $('document')? I really don't even know what to search on google :p
[20:31:59] <Eviltwin> riyonuk: Is "beacuse" a good enough answer?
[20:32:09] <riyonuk> No :)
[20:32:19] <Eviltwin> Okay
[20:32:29] <Eviltwin> Do you understand the difference between document and "document"?
[20:32:43] <riyonuk> Yeah
[20:32:47] <riyonuk> Wait.
[20:32:49] <riyonuk> No :/
[20:33:22] <Eviltwin> Do you understand the difference between 2+2 and "2+2"?
[20:33:31] <riyonuk> Yes, haha.
[20:33:48] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/xSEBR/
[20:33:52] <riyonuk> but in my roommates code, he has $('document') and it works just fine
[20:33:54] <gloomer> ohh eviltwin is busting out goog examples
[20:34:05] <Eviltwin> riyonuk: http://jsfiddle.net/xSEBR/1/
[20:34:10] <gigafied> think even better would be "2" + "2"
[20:34:24] <Eviltwin> gigafied: Not really what we're getting into right now
[20:34:33] <riyonuk> Ahh, interesting.
[20:34:44] <Eviltwin> riyonuk: See the difference?
[20:34:48] <riyonuk> So there IS a difference! I knew I was right. Thanks man :]
[20:35:13] <Behi> riyonuk document is an object, "document" is a string. Eviltwin is that what you want to say!? :)
[20:35:31] <Eviltwin> So $(document) is a jQuery object containing document element
[20:35:45] <Eviltwin> $("document") is a jQuery object containing elements that match the selector "document"
[20:35:52] <Eviltwin> Unfortunately that selector doesn't match anything
[20:36:46] <gigafied> http://jsfiddle.net/DuLEk/
[20:37:16] <_xor> Thanks for the help guys, it's much appreciated :)
[20:37:20] <_xor> I've got to run and finish this stuff. bbl.
[20:37:20] <_xor> gg
[20:38:26] <Eviltwin> Behi: Actually I've decided this is pretty reasonable
[20:39:48] <Behi> Eviltwin cool :) thanks!
[20:42:31] <andrrres> this makes no sense. I changed the name of the working function, and it does this function is undefined, even though I made it
[20:43:37] <zeroLiver> Anyone know what may be wrong with this line of code. works in ff,chrome,ie9 but not ie8 and ie7 1.  $("#colour_message").replaceWith( "<span id='colour_message'>: " + colourName + "</span>" );		
[20:43:52] <zeroLiver> I have a small example at http://jsfiddle.net/JPZxE/
[20:46:16] <CantUnplug> zeroLiver.. why not $('#colour_message').html(colourName);
[20:46:52] <CantUnplug> so you arnt replacing the object, just changing its property
[20:47:46] <zeroLiver> Yep I will try .html again. I had $("#colour_message").html(":" + colourName );		
[20:48:07] <CantUnplug> that shoudl work too
[20:48:40] <CantUnplug> if its just string, no nodes, you can do .text too
[20:48:49] <CantUnplug> but .html is universal and wors well
[20:48:52] <CantUnplug> wworks
[20:49:44] <LordThumper> Does this make sense? event.target.closest(".column").remove();
[20:50:41] <Eviltwin> LordThumper:
[20:50:42] <Eviltwin> No
[20:50:52] <Eviltwin> But this does: $(event.target).closest(".column").remove();
[20:51:03] <LordThumper> Ah thanks alot Eviltwin
[20:52:17] <coldhead> andrrres: link to the latest?
[20:52:53] <zeroLiver> Thanks CantUnplug. I just tried .html and .text they both work except in ie8 and ie7. Seems like they should definately work so not sure what the problem is just yet. Not getting any errors in ie dev tools or chrome dev tools either hmmm.
[20:55:23] <zeroLiver> Just going to investigate the event that triggers the $("#colour_message").html(":" + colourName ); to execute. Thanks for your help CantUnplug.
[20:55:36] <CantUnplug> i know they work in ie 7,8,9,10 etc.. i use it a lot in some things..  did you happen to have multiple elements with the same id?
[20:56:14] <zeroLiver> I hope not lol I will double check
[20:56:47] <CantUnplug> ive seen that happen in IE.. it (rightfully so) bombs if you have multiple ID's
[20:56:49] <zeroLiver> nope just the one id as usual
[20:57:03] <gloomer> its Ie, stop worrying about it and move on :)
[20:57:09] <gloomer> only the noobs will see it like that anyway
[20:57:10] <zeroLiver> hahaha
[20:57:32] <gloomer> time would probably be better spent finding an exploit to auto update their browser
[20:57:43] <CantUnplug> ha
[20:59:02] <zeroLiver> Nope will have to solve this issue otherwise the business sales will drop, if I complete the code how it is now.
[20:59:30] <CantUnplug> is that span comign back from an ajax call by chance?
[20:59:35] <CantUnplug> might be a scope issue
[20:59:59] <CantUnplug> $('#colour_message', responseText).html()....
[21:00:11] <gloomer> whats your code zeroLiver?
[21:00:15] <gloomer> live example?
[21:00:35] <CantUnplug> does it work in IE on jsfiddle?
[21:00:44] <zeroLiver> I have a test site with the live code.
[21:00:51] <zeroLiver> Think I can show you that
[21:01:36] <zeroLiver> http://longtest.nzservers.com/product/7129/belay-vest/
[21:02:22] <CantUnplug> i bet it has to do with your onclick for the img
[21:02:28] <CantUnplug> ie not inding
[21:02:31] <CantUnplug> binding
[21:02:57] <CantUnplug> http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/using_images_as
[21:03:02] <CantUnplug> there you go
[21:03:28] <zeroLiver> Cheers man, I was just going to investigate that.
[21:03:48] <zeroLiver> I think that will be it
[21:03:58] <zeroLiver> I will go for now. Cheers for your help once again
[21:04:10] <CantUnplug> np
[21:04:55] <CantUnplug> the jquery solution on the bottom is clean and simple
[21:17:45] <surfdue> if I run getscript twice is it intelligent to know that we already recieved that script file
[21:17:50] <surfdue> assuming there has been no changes.
[21:18:50] <gloomer> doubt it
[21:19:01] <gloomer> but just look at the source
[21:20:40] <surfdue> oh hi
[21:21:55] <gloomer> jo
[21:21:56] <gloomer> hi
[21:23:29] <surfdue> i need to find a way to ensure they arent double loaded
[21:24:53] <gloomer> why would they be double loaded?
[21:24:55] <gloomer> in the first place
[21:26:38] <surfdue> as per our previous dicussions I am using an existing library and when I open a file i load the theme and highlighting plugin
[21:26:45] <surfdue> well if i double load them the entire thing blows up.
[21:26:45] <surfdue> :P
[21:28:28] <gloomer> would need to see the code
[21:28:59] <gloomer> even the callback of getscript is too late to do any checking
[21:29:00] <ngharo> so check for a variable/function name from the loaded script
[21:29:04] <gloomer> so you should check before you call it
[21:29:18] <surfdue> yep going to dump it all into an object
[21:36:23] <pythonirc1011> hi - I've a div element that i would like to vertically and horizontally center on the screen. Can jquery do this?
[21:37:06] <gloomer> pythonirc1011 css can :)
[21:37:41] <gloomer> jquery could too but why.. :)
[21:37:42] <Eviltwin> gloomer: It depends
[21:38:01] <Eviltwin> CSS can if it's got a fixed height and width
[21:38:02] <pythonirc1011> gloomer: http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2010/03/centering-div-vertically-and-horizontally/3.html -- how does this work?
[21:38:20] <Eviltwin> pythonirc1011: View Source
[21:38:21] <Eviltwin> It's right there
[21:39:19] <pythonirc1011> Trying to undestand the code...what i dont understand is what dom element does the jquery select and center
[21:39:50] <gloomer> className
[21:40:01] <pythonirc1011> got it
[21:40:02] <pythonirc1011> thanks
[21:40:17] <GoSox> for an example, they probably should have picked a better name for a class than "className"
[21:40:37] <gloomer> lol
[21:40:44] <gloomer> centeredBox
[21:40:49] <gloomer> would be nice
[21:41:02] <pythonirc1011> thanks
[21:47:07] <RishiKul> Hi, I'm using this plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/magic-gallery/ for my WP site here http://www.tresdots.net/ I'm in need that when user clicks on the thumbnails of my image slider the respective site of that image should get opened in a new tab, is anything is related to jquery for achieving this? thanks in advance :)
[21:47:32] <PaperBoy> Hi. Does anyone know of a good free Project management or task tracking thing  to act as a spec list ?
[21:48:47] <morficus_> hey guys - the 'Authorization' header is not getting sent in my cross-domain AJAX request, dissipate the fact that I'm setting it in the 'beforeSend' section.  Could this be a bug with jQuery?
[21:49:03] <morficus_> all the other headers I set in 'beforeSend' are sent over fine, but not the 'Authorization' header
[21:50:12] <morficus> so I'm wondering if this is (a) a jquery bug, (b) an httpxmlrequest limitation - and if there is a way around this
[21:54:37] <gloomer> let me see the code morficus
[21:54:46] <morficus> sure, one sec
[21:56:32] <morficus> gloomer: http://jsfiddle.net/Ppmu9/
[21:57:52] <morficus> I'm running into the exact same issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3393489/cross-domain-basic-authentication-using-jquery
[21:59:04] <morficus> gloomer: I can provide the request and response headers if needed too.
[21:59:23] <aple> Can I have multiple instances of the document.ready function within one page?
[21:59:45] <GoSox> is anyone here near canton michigan by any chance?
[21:59:56] <morficus> GoSox: yeah, why?
[21:59:57] <coldhead> i have a server near there!
[22:00:27] <skamikaze> morficus: proxy with local request, auth with e.g. curl by your backend side and fetch answer
[22:00:28] <GoSox> hah just messing with you, i needed to test out this ip locaiton tool and you were the closest person to my cursor
[22:00:28] <morficus> coldhead: people have servers in canton?  :-p
[22:00:46] <GoSox> coldhead: is your server in Troy?
[22:00:49] <GoSox> i think that's where mine is
[22:00:57] <GoSox> even though i live in massachusetts
[22:01:05] <surfdue> I need to prompt when they attempt to leave the page if there is unsaved changes to their document
[22:01:12] <surfdue> whats the best and most compatible method?
[22:01:39] <GoSox> surfdue: that is a problem that web browsers should have solved years ago and it pisses me off that they still haven't
[22:01:50] <gloomer> looking morficus
[22:01:51] <morficus> skamikaze: that would work great... except that what you suggest is not a clean solution :-(
[22:02:04] <skamikaze> surfdue: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[22:02:17] <skamikaze> morficus: what's not "clean" there? :)
[22:03:10] <morficus> skamikaze: it makes it scenario  specific.   what if I don't have a backend
[22:03:15] <morficus> (which in this case I don't)
[22:03:43] <coldhead> yeah i think it's troy
[22:03:59] <morficus> GoSox: stop sniffing my Interwebz  :-p
[22:04:07] <ryanseddon> is there an option ti switch off auto hiding of the url bar in jquery mobile?
[22:04:13] <GoSox> your interwebz smells funnay
[22:04:14] <ryanseddon> s/ti/to
[22:04:24] <GoSox> coldhead: are you also a waveform customer?
[22:05:01] <coldhead> uh, not that i know of
[22:05:06] <coldhead> but resellers today...
[22:05:12] <coldhead> we all might be
[22:05:34] <skamikaze> morficus: rfc a new same origin policy for browsers ;P
[22:05:46] <GoSox> what is your server's IP?
[22:05:50] <morficus> skamikaze: it's called CORS  ;-)
[22:06:20] <morficus> http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/   and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing
[22:06:44] <morficus> JSONP is not the only way around the same-origin police :-p
[22:08:33] * skamikaze bows
[22:09:00] <morficus> I've done my research haha
[22:09:24] <gloomer> ya you win :)
[22:09:35] <morficus> oh yeah? what did win?
[22:10:00] <gloomer> a tough request to answer im not sure how to do cross domain basic auth with ajax, even for GEt
[22:10:32] <morficus> :-(
[22:11:32] <morficus> the good news is that I'm not alone. I've found a few posts around the web where people have the same issue (Authorization header not being sent in cross-domain AJAX)
[22:11:41] <aamironline> Which is the best channel for JavaScript related queries?
[22:11:47] <morficus> the bad news: I'm yet to find a single success story :-(
[22:11:51] <aple> Anyone know what this is doing? http://worldvisionmedia.ca/connect/youth-redirect/
[22:12:00] <morficus> aamironline: ##javascript
[22:12:00] <tavl> I have a big div, with other small divs inside it (absolute positioned)... Is there a simple way to detect the mouseclick event on any small div and, for example, highlight all them?
[22:12:02] <aple> I'm trying a timer redirect, but it seems to be hanging
[22:12:23] <gloomer> morficus, i like the slackware answer well i turned off basic auth on jsonp lol
[22:13:02] <morficus> haha, that made me lol too
[22:13:04] <aamironline> Thank you very much @ChanServ, @morficus

[22:36:43] <oplacker> The saddening advice parts the vegetarian throughout a designate purple.  The crushed dread gangs the everyday liaison.
[22:36:57] <coldhead> damn you, botfather
[22:37:34] <yogurt_truck> jesus...
[22:37:53] <GoSox> is he still going?
[22:37:56] <surfdue> :/
[22:38:08] <yogurt_truck> he's gone now
[22:38:13] <coldhead> that was quite a crap flood
[22:38:15] <coldhead> ima PM that dude
[22:38:27] <GoSox> you think there would be a last resort type flood check
[22:38:36] <surfdue> this is going to sound really stupid, but console.log reports the id var to be undefined (in grey coloring) yet I cant check with an if? if(var != 'undefined')
[22:38:37] <GoSox> after a minute of flooding, maybe you should get auto kicked
[22:38:37] <coldhead> usually there is
[22:38:39] <surfdue> why wont that work?
[22:39:11] <surfdue> PS. its obv he was asking for a tissue.
[22:40:09] <surfdue> Oh got it, just used it in a plain if. No checking
[22:41:30] <pifantastic> surfdue: if (typeof var != 'undefined;)
[22:41:43] <pifantastic> surfdue: err  if (typeof var != 'undefined')
[22:41:45] <surfdue> pifantastic: if(var) seems to work too. is that bad practicE?
[22:42:11] <pifantastic> surfdue: it depends on what you're checking.
[22:42:20] <pifantastic> if (var) will check for 'falsiness'
[22:42:41] <surfdue> i need someone to look at my site but there is a login.. pifantastic have any experience with ace?
[22:43:06] <pifantastic> surfdue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1995113/strangest-language-feature/1998224#1998224
[22:43:09] <pifantastic> surfdue: nope
[22:43:37] <surfdue> jquery is confused. :P
[22:43:56] <yogurt_truck> surfdue: and typeof myVar won't throw a ReferenceError if myVar actually doesn't exist at all, but if (myVar) will
[22:44:27] <surfdue> i was wondering why i was getting reference errors.
[22:44:27] <surfdue> :P
[22:45:55] <surfdue> In php you can do something like this $var = "Yay some text $hello or an object {$object->foo}";
[22:46:21] <Jmirc> yes surfdue
[22:46:24] <surfdue> I am not doing it, but I was wondering if its the same... Everything else seems pretty similar.
[22:46:26] <pifantastic> surfdue: javascript does not have string interpolation like that
[22:46:34] <pifantastic> you must concatentate
[22:46:36] <yogurt_truck> surfdue: there's no string interpolation like that in javascript
[22:46:38] <surfdue> bugger.
[22:47:01] <surfdue> aka var Foo = "hi my name is " + name;
[22:47:11] <yogurt_truck> yup
[22:47:28] <surfdue> always confused me why js uses + vs ., because + is traditionally for integers
[22:48:27] <mrgenixus> so, for some reason, (and it might be the filesize) my jquery is firing well before my stylesheet is loaded
[22:48:28] <Jmirc> its just a rule
[22:48:35] <mrgenixus> is there anything I can do about it?
[22:49:05] <surfdue> mrgenixus: in line order what is first in your head?
[22:49:17] <mrgenixus> the stylesheet
[22:49:23] <sente> what the heck is the 'my' and 'at' near the bottom of http://jsfiddle.net/sente/uuVeD/7/ , i've never seen that before
[22:49:49] <Jmirc> mrgenxisus, do you have document loaded?
[22:50:01] <surfdue> mrgenixus: can you make a jsfiddle with an example its hard to say without seeing, but it is possible that for example your loading uncompressed or non-minified version of JS that takes longer to load depending on your site/server.
[22:50:02] <mrgenixus> how's that?
[22:50:13] <yogurt_truck> sente: jquery UI's position plugin
[22:50:43] <yogurt_truck> sente: http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[22:51:03] <Jmirc> ?ready
[22:51:20] <Jmirc> bot-t?
[22:51:23] <mrgenixus> ironically, I need to check something
[22:51:28] <mrgenixus> I think I've made a mistake
[22:52:03] <Jmirc> mrgenxisus, google on .ready()
[22:52:32] <mrgenixus> familiar with it
[22:52:42] <Jmirc> I am on mobile, so it doesnt work properly
[22:53:08] <mrgenixus> I'm pretty sure I didn't have the stylesheets first
[22:53:12] <mrgenixus> even thought I thought so
[22:53:55] <sente> yogurt_truck: thanks
[22:54:34] <mrgenixus> yus , I'm pretty sure that I'm just dumb
[22:54:36] <mrgenixus> have a great night
[22:55:10] <Jmirc> lool
[22:55:14] <Jmirc> porblem solved!
[22:55:20] <Jmirc> case closed
[22:55:22] <dr0id> ?cc
[22:55:36] <dr0id> CASE CLOASED
[22:55:37] <Jmirc> droid i was faster
[22:55:55] <Jmirc> and for some reason, bott doesnt work
[22:56:06] <dr0id> cause its not there in the channel AT THE MOMENT
[22:56:24] <yogurt_truck> is on vacation
[22:56:32] <Jmirc> aww
[22:56:45] <dr0id> deserves
[22:56:57] <Jmirc> vacation to where?
[22:57:12] <dr0id> China
[22:58:00] <yogurt_truck> China/post-SOPA US (same thing)
[22:58:54] <Jmirc> yoghurt. You say what?
[23:01:25] <pythonirc1011> background: url(/static/images/bg.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed; -- is there a way to ask jquery to scale bg.jpg nicely and put it as background to my page? (exactly the page size)
[23:02:03] <yogurt_truck> Jmirc: that was just my (unsuccessful) attempt at humour + social commentary, :<
[23:10:04] <X99> where is the c# channel?
[23:10:42] <gloomer> csharp
[23:11:36] <X99> yes
[23:11:47] <vladikoff> yes yes!
[23:12:14] <X99> I can't find it..
[23:13:38] <vladikoff> X99, ##Csharp
[23:14:45] <X99> thanks a lot.:)
[23:15:00] <vladikoff> X99, have a great day!
[23:16:02] <X99> vladikoff,the same to you.
[23:18:28] <solidus-river> what on earth woudl cause the width of an li to be indented from teh ul container
[23:18:34] <solidus-river> i'm getting an li thats only 50% of the ul's list
[23:18:36] <solidus-river> *width
[23:19:05] <tavl> is there a way to get something like offset(), but to the parent, not the document? I tried position(), but it's not considering the center alignment. I need the "real" position, after the centering calculations.
[23:19:59] <gloomer> tavl why not just get both positions and do the math :)
[23:20:21] <tavl> gloomer: coz position is returning (0,0)
[23:20:48] <tavl> gloomer: and i'm sure it's "wrong", coz the element is centered, inside it's parent
[23:21:03] <tavl> (not wrong... just not the information I need)
[23:21:42] <tavl> gloomer: wait wait... i think i got your idea... :)
[23:21:54] <dr0id> :)
[23:22:17] <tavl> (just want to be sure there's no more straight wait)
[23:22:58] <dr0id> does position: relative; on parent helps ?
[23:25:28] <tavl> dr0id: it's already relative
[23:25:37] * tavl trying gloomer approach
[23:25:40] <aple> Anyone know why this redirect code doesn't work internally (on the same server) but works fine if I redirect to an external site? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/524381/
[23:26:05] <dr0id> then position() should work
[23:26:19] <dr0id> can you show a testcase ?
[23:27:17] <tavl> dr0id: kinda hard to split everything and build the testcase, right now
[23:27:39] <dr0id> I was just interested in the issue :) wanted to play with it/
[23:27:45] <tavl> gloomer: btw, no luck... parent offset - child offset = 0... =(
[23:27:58] <tavl> * child - parent
[23:28:05] <aple> nm, got it working with relative paths
[23:29:09] <gloomer> tavl can you put up test case
[23:29:20] <tavl> aple: did you centered the child?
[23:29:26] <tavl> gloomer: not right now
[23:29:36] <dr0id> ok, do it tommorrow
[23:29:42] <dr0id> we'll waot
[23:29:45] <dr0id> wait
[23:31:39] <FleetFox> are there any jquery based wyswygs besides https://github.com/akzhan/jwysiwyg ?
[23:31:53] <FleetFox> This one is ugly and only gets worse
[23:33:12] <tavl> dr0id: lol
[23:33:39] <tavl> dr0id: just got a lot of more bugs to solve... this one will be postponed for tomorrow... :)
[23:39:34] <ximarin> hi all, is someone familiar with notepad++ AND Weaverslave? I'm looking for a n++ - plugin that works as the button-bar ind weaver so that I can start a specific macro with just clicking a button and not a keyboard-shortcut
[23:49:04] <solidus-river> ximarin: sorry, no idea, but why not go and learn something like vim if your really looking for that level of functionality?
[23:50:35] <sheldonh> is there shorthand for $("#some_id")[0], such that i either get the element or undefined? (i'm getting an array at the moment, and am struggling to find the idiom for (if this thing exists, do some stuff with it)
[23:51:13] <ximarin> actually I fear vim, it's hard get my head into how it works
[23:51:59] <solidus-river> ximarin: well if your really into macros etc and actually into them, you'll love the power of vim after some tutorials
[23:52:32] <sheldonh> doh, i just asked an FAQ. sorry :(
[23:52:33] <solidus-river> ximarin: your right though it can be mind boggling at first, i was scared of it for a couple years before i actually learned
