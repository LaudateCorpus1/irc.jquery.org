[11:09:17] <shoky> mark36ph: you're not passing any `make` to makeAjaxRequest2. otherwise, check your browser's devtools network tab to see the requests sent and the responses received to see if it's what you're expecting, check console for errors. etc..
[11:11:32] <shoky> also you're sending the same params with different names in the url and in data argument
[11:53:30] <jak2001> friends offtopic question: http://imgur.com/a/PK1SH   how to fix the strange characters?
[14:16:12] <toothfairy_> Hi... Could someone please show me how to make each link in this list an ajax post request with the message.id object included... https://dpaste.de/MDnw   been looking around for examples but no luck.
[15:25:43] <mark4> so i have a bunch of media queries that set various properties.  in one class i have a --foo: n; custom css element or what ever they are called.  jquery is not recognizing that when i try read the value from it
[15:26:03] <mark4> how do i read these "variables" as they are called?
[15:38:33] <pavonia> mark4: Have you tried style.getProperty?
[15:38:57] <mark4> there is no such thing that i can find. thers style.getPropertyValue
[15:39:04] <mark4> and am looking at it but its also not working for me
[15:40:14] <pavonia> Oh right, it's setProperty but getPropertyValue :S
[15:41:00] <mark4> problem is im probably butchering the syntax lol
[15:43:27] <NateRageous> hi - anyone here for a little Q&A? Stuck on a pretty menial problem...
[15:43:29] <mark4> var x = jQuery(".blah").style.getPropertyValue("--rows");
[15:47:27] <NateRageous> i'm trying to load on pageload, with a dynamic html element... i've learned to load on a button click, but meshing that code with onPageLoad is beyond me
[15:51:05] <pavonia> mark4: .get(0).style to get the DOM element, but for me that still only gives empty strings
[15:53:32] <mark4> lol it locked up my X, had to alt f2 out and killall firefox
[15:53:51] <mark4> ar x = jQuery(".blah").get(0).style.getPropertyValue("--rows");
[15:53:56] <mark4> var even
[15:54:59] <mark4> oopts wrong button
[15:55:41] <pavonia> Hhm, $("div").css("--color") works for me
[15:58:16] <mark4> hang on let me test that
[15:59:40] <mark4> var x = jQuery("div").css("--rows"); does not work
[16:00:00] <mark4> which browser are you using?
[16:02:28] <pavonia> A Firefox clone
[16:03:24] <mark4> yea im using firefox
[16:03:30] <mark4> erm. how do i bring up the java console in ff?
[16:03:45] <pavonia> F12
[16:04:27] <mark4> that brings up a window with 2834562893745 elements in it that are all almsot too small to see
[16:04:44] <mark4> all i want is the java console, not a full blown html css javascript debugging user interface
[16:04:55] <mark4> with a2876598234698 buttons and knobs and no space to read anything
[16:04:59] <pavonia> lol
[16:06:03] <pavonia> Or maybe it's Ctrl+Shift+J for you
[16:14:20] <mark4> well i tried both ways and console.log produces no output on it
[16:14:32] <mark4> but img getting spammed with messages from elsewhere
[16:16:51] <mark4> yup. cannot get any console.log() output to show on ctrl shift J or ctrl shift K
[16:17:04] <mark4> but i know the code is working because alert works in place of console.log
[16:17:45] <pavonia> console.log doesn't work for me either :(
[16:18:28] <mark4> on windows you have to launch ff with firefox -console
[16:18:33] <mark4> or you dont get a console
[16:18:35] <mark4> im in linux
[16:19:15] <mark4> You cannot write to the console directly from untrusted JavaScript
[16:19:21] <mark4> which is utter bullshit
[16:19:46] <mark4> aha
[16:19:47] <mark4> rowser.dom.window.console.enabled
[16:20:16] <mark4> except i guess thats not in about:config :/
[16:49:18] <mark4> pita but got it working
[16:51:38] <toothfairy_> Hi... Could someone please show me how to make each link in this list an ajax post request with the message.id object included... https://dpaste.de/MDnw   been looking around for examples but no luck.
[17:12:00] <mark4> so is there an event associated with when the user stops resizing a window?
[17:16:08] <hellyeah> anyone knows about handlebars?
[18:16:04] <mark4> how do you do a mouse over event on a cell phone :/
[18:16:31] <mark4> would a tap into the mouse over area count as a mouse over?
[18:25:38] <mark4> if i have a string with a number of <div> </div> elements how can i separate them all out into an array? (i need to retain the div/div tags too
[18:26:06] <mark4> actually i lied lol they are <nav> elements
[22:45:35] <bryanruiz> hi.. i remember some kind of function that would allow me to load the variables from an ajax response..  my ajax response has a mix of html and <script>var somevar = "somestuff";</script>..   its suppose to be a quick solution, not an elegant one
