[04:03:59] <undefined_bob> is there any way to make individual words inside a textattribute bold? this is the element <span class="com_list" data-balloon="this word should be BOLD>this one not</span> data-balloon will be processed by CSS
[04:32:11] <Cork> undefined_bob: no
[04:32:20] <Cork> undefined_bob: you can't style text at all in css
[04:32:37] <Cork> you style elements (except for first word, first line and things like that)
[04:34:56] <undefined_bob> good morning Cork but is it possible to manipulate this text with JS/jQ without rewriting the whole balloon thing in JS?
[04:37:27] <Cork> undefined_bob: its just an attribute, it has no style
[04:37:54] <Cork> undefined_bob: if you want to style it you will have to look at the script using the value
[04:38:09] <Cork> and what styling methods it has
[04:38:16] <undefined_bob> there is no script, it is only processed by CSS
[04:38:39] <Cork> no
[04:38:48] <undefined_bob> ja :(
[04:38:53] <Cork> if you have data-baloon something will have to use it
[04:39:08] <Cork> unless you use ::after attr() in css
[04:39:20] <Cork> and if you do then you can't style it per word at all
[04:39:20] <undefined_bob> yes, its a kinda big css file which use that
[04:39:30] <Cork> cause after can't have children
[04:40:06] <undefined_bob> there is no JavaScript or anything beside the CSS file
[04:40:51] <Cork> read the response
[04:41:00] <undefined_bob> yes, I did
[04:41:15] <undefined_bob> I replied to your sentence before
[04:41:20] <Cork> then you have the answers
[04:41:37] <undefined_bob> I dont like impossible things :o
[04:41:44] <Cork> it isn't inpossible
[04:41:52] <Cork> it just can't be solved with the solution you've choosen
[04:42:01] <Cork> so pick a different solution
[04:42:14] <Cork> js isn't required
[04:42:21] <Cork> but you can't use attr() in css
[04:42:36] <undefined_bob> means I would have to rewrite the balloon thing with JS
[04:42:40] <Cork> no
[04:42:53] <Cork> but you would have to move from attributes to elements
[04:43:20] <Cork> i've done it plenty of time, it isn't hard
[04:44:01] <Cork> <a class="tooltip"><i class="tip">this is the message</i></a>
[04:44:12] <undefined_bob> I havent done it before and the CSS is big for this balloon thing
[04:44:20] <Cork> and then just a hide on .tooltip > .tip until hover
[04:44:41] <undefined_bob> I see
[04:44:56] <Cork> THEN you can style it how ever you like
[04:45:08] <Cork> cause then you have something that can hold styles
[04:45:25] <undefined_bob> thanks for your time :) but I guess its easier to just live without bold headlines in the tooltip
[04:45:44] <Cork> you can bold everything, but not parts ya
[04:46:07] <undefined_bob> would only be a nice to have, would not justify the time I would spend for the rework
[04:46:36] <undefined_bob> I didnt know thats its not possible to manipulate attributes with JS/jQ
[04:46:51] <Cork> you can manipulate attributes
[04:46:56] <Cork> but that isn't what you're asking for
[04:47:11] <undefined_bob> with manipulate I meant add style
[04:47:22] <Cork> ya, js can modify dom
[04:47:52] <undefined_bob> but attributes are not in the dom?
[04:48:26] <Cork> js can't style anything, it can add values to the dom
[04:48:38] <Cork> so what the dom can do is what js can do (except for with canvas)
[04:48:51] <Cork> so if you do it with js or not isn't what matters
[04:48:58] <Cork> but what css can access
[04:49:44] <undefined_bob> ah I understand
[04:49:58] <Cork> and css can access things through selectors or the through element attribute style
[04:50:09] <Cork> and heither exist for a word in a string
[04:50:14] <undefined_bob> and because CSS cant access this attribute, JS cant help
[04:50:19] <Cork> *nether
[04:50:26] <Cork> exactly
[04:50:46] <Cork> well it can access the attribute, but not the individual words in the string
[04:50:46] <undefined_bob> so this attribute is a string?
[04:50:51] <Cork> the value for it is
[04:51:01] <Cork> a domstring i think the type is
[04:51:17] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString
[04:51:18] <undefined_bob> the text in the attribute is a string?
[04:51:29] <Cork> all values in attributes are strings
[04:51:56] <Cork> dom properties can sometimes be not strings
[04:54:08] <undefined_bob> I try to understand why CSS cant access the values in the attribute individually. I mean, what is the limitation?
[04:54:57] <Cork> undefined_bob: css can access attr(data-baloon) but how would you specify "word 5"
[04:55:10] <undefined_bob> counting?
[04:55:15] <Cork> with what?
[04:55:34] <Cork> css has no method to split the string and add rules for each separate thing
[04:55:51] <undefined_bob> that would be nice, wouldn't it?
[04:56:08] <Cork> it would make the dom much more complex and even slower then it already is
[04:56:09] <Cork> so no
[04:56:15] <undefined_bob> but ya, thats the answer, I guess
[04:57:18] <undefined_bob> thank you for the explanation :)
[07:48:59] <surial> Hey folks. In trying to prepare for a CSP world, I'm removing all my inline styles. I have _A LOT_ of display: none. I'm replacing those with HTML property 'hidden', but often jquery gets hopelessly confused when I do this (or, rather, I get confused I guess), and when I for example .show() these elements, jquery starts messing with display:, bouncing from 'none' to 'inherit' ,isntead of editing the 'hidden' property.
[07:49:40] <surial> Right now I just fix the symptom by running .prop("hidden", false) where needed but this feels inelegant. I had a different solutoin in mind: On page load, find every DOM element that is hidden via hidden="hidden" (so, :hidden wouldn't do it, and the docs on the :hidden selector are rife with performance warnings, so that sounds like a bad idea), and replace that with display: none instead.
[07:50:42] <surial> Two questions: [A] before I continue down this path, am I on the right track here or is there some sort of setting where I can tell jquery to acknowledge the DOM hidden attribute, and [B] how do I end up with a jquery object containing all DOM elements with precisely the attribute 'hidden' set (not 'all hidden elements', i.e. if an element is hidden due to display: none, or having a parent that is hidden, or having width/height
[07:50:42] <surial>  0.. I don't want those, :hidden does give me those.
[07:57:37] <surial> update: The :hidden selector doesn't even find DOM hidden="hidden". That's... WTF? Should I file a bug? Is hidden (the DOM property) really new or something?
[08:01:40] <Cork> surial: hidden values are only valid on form fields
[08:01:48] <Cork> not spans and divs and so on
[08:03:34] <surial> Incorrect.
[08:03:42] <Cork> no, it isn't
[08:03:46] <surial> you're thinking of type="hidden".
[08:03:53] <surial> I'm speaking of hidden="hidden" (where the ="hidden") part is optional.
[08:03:55] <Cork> ya, on form fields
[08:03:57] <surial> no.
[08:04:09] <surial> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden
[08:04:19] <surial> By the definition of 'MDN thinks so', and also by the definition of 'all major browsers support it'.
[08:04:48] <surial> I seem to have found my answer: $("*[hidden]").css("display", "none").prop("hidden", false);
[08:04:56] <Cork> appanrently a new attribute added ya
[08:05:07] <Cork> introdused in the canvas time, didn't know that
[08:05:16] <surial> Presumably because of CSP.
[08:05:17] <Cork> but ya :hidden has nothing to do with that attribute
[08:05:22] <Cork> no
[08:05:23] <surial> And that seems idiotic to me.
[08:05:27] <Cork> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-hidden-attribute
[08:05:38] <surial> :hidden goes out of its way to try to find all hidden things, even going so far as to find things with an explicit width and height of 0.
[08:05:39] <Cork> csp just means you use css to style things
[08:05:41] <Cork> like classes
[08:05:49] <surial> huh? What? We must be talking about different things.
[08:06:04] <surial> I meant CSP: Content Security Policy.
[08:06:05] <Cork> csp is that inline code is blocked by the browser
[08:06:06] <Cork> ya
[08:06:11] <surial> not just code.
[08:06:18] <Cork> you load external resources that you whitelist
[08:06:19] <surial> images. movies. _STYLE SHEETS_.
[08:06:33] <Cork> ya, but blocking everything makes for a very unusable page
[08:06:40] <Cork> so you have whitelists like self
[08:06:57] <Cork> (allowing to load resources from the local server)
[08:07:04] <surial> So either [A] use hidden="hidden", or [B] use style="display: none;".. and also add inline to your list of allowed sstylesheets which is bad, or [C] try to make your page work without having any hidden stuff preloaded, which is stupid.
[08:07:06] <surial> hence: hidden.
[08:07:13] <surial> Which makes it kinda ridiculous that jquery isn't aware of this.
[08:07:46] <surial> I don't want to sound like an ass or anything, but you've clearly not run into any of this and don't quite understand the concerns. Which means I can't exactly take your word for how to approach content desired to be hidden and make it work well with both CSP as a concept and jquery.
[08:11:03] <thykka> surial, why not just use an utility class?
[08:11:12] <surial> I'm game. Like what?
[08:11:31] <thykka> .hidden { display: none !important } and then instead of .hide() and .show() you'd use .addClass('hidden') .removeClass('hidden')
[08:12:16] <Cork> thykka: would require a css file something he doesn't want
[08:14:04] <thykka> eh.. so no other resources but the .html file?
[08:14:20] <Cork> that is how i understood his comment ya
[08:14:27] <thykka> seems like a weird objective
[08:14:33] <Cork> and where i kinda lost interest
[08:14:38] <thykka> especially if they want to "get rid of inline styles"
[08:14:45] <Cork> ya
[08:14:54] <thykka> surial, can you confirm?
[08:15:00] <surial> okay, the plot thickens even more: On a very basic page, I have <div id="testDiv" hidden>HELLO</div>. I load it and run in jquery: $("#testDiv").show() and.. it shows (jq 3.3.1).
[08:15:08] <surial> On another page with bootstrap on it (maybe that's the difference), same trick: Nothing.
[08:15:14] <surial> $("#testDiv").prop("hidden", false).. THEN it shows.
[08:15:27] <Cork> surial: .show() does it by setting an inline style..
[08:15:33] <surial> thykka: the problem with <div class="hidden">) is that if the stylesheet doesn't load, it looks like arse.
[08:15:36] <Cork> if you have csp active it won't do anything
[08:15:38] <surial> Also, it's a lot of typing and inelegant.
[08:15:50] <thykka> why would it not load, and are you saying the page would otherwise look fine?
[08:15:52] <surial> and eliminating hide() and show() as workable options means I can't use .fadeIn(0 and friends either.
[08:16:06] <surial> Cork: no, that is fine.
[08:16:14] <surial> Cork: Please read up on or experiment with CSP.
[08:16:20] <Cork> uh... wtf
[08:16:23] <Cork> are you high?
[08:16:27] <Cork> i have it in production...
[08:16:33] <surial> Try it.
[08:16:43] <Cork> i know what jquery functions do...
[08:16:51] <surial> Set a CSP header for styles that disallows inline styles, and then have a ball adding inline styles via jquery. That's fine. the CSP header applies on load.
[08:17:09] <thykka> what the hell kind of scenario is this, if you can run JS, but not link CSS files?
[08:17:10] <Cork> uh, no
[08:17:45] <Cork> that would cirkumvent the entire reason to block inline...
[08:17:51] <Cork> xss
[08:17:55] <surial> thykka: <div hidden>FOO</div> has winning properties all around: It's short, it's elegant (in that it is simple to read and does what it says it does; no more, no less), it requires no stylesheet to preload prior to the content (insofar as that you have issues with the flash of unstyled content, <div hidden> won't have any problems with it), etc.
[08:18:14] <surial> Cork: CSP ensures only javascript you trust runs and loads. And if THAT javascript adds a style someplace, good for you.
[08:18:35] <surial> You think CSP preventing javascript adding styles is helping out? You do realize the same javascript can add entire DOM elements, right?
[08:18:35] <Cork> surial: and inline style blocking is to prevent data() injection
[08:19:04] <surial> I don't know what's going on but this conversation is not useful whatsoever.
[08:19:35] <Cork> that has to be one of the most arrogant persons i've seen in a long while...
[08:34:54] <undefined_bob> lol wtf
[09:07:56] <Hplioa> How can i prevent the last input to add current inserted value fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/t6fc3md5/
[09:08:54] <Cork> prevent to insert what?
[09:10:42] <Hplioa> new fiddle Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/t6fc3md5/1/ when you insert a number in the first input it jumps to the next one, now by the last one i want to insert the latest number
[09:11:09] <Cork> Hplioa: you mean create a new input field?
[09:11:20] <Cork> or where should it insert the number
[09:11:43] <Hplioa> Cork: no when you insert a number at last input it must put the latest number
[09:12:01] <Hplioa> Cork: but now if you press 1 and than 2 it first removes the previous one
[09:13:08] <Hplioa> Cork: i try to create to insert 6 digits numbers like Apple activation
[09:13:36] <Cork> i struggle to understand what you're asking for
[09:13:50] <Cork> you mean you want to always focus the first one without an entered number?
[09:14:32] <Cork> cause when you input a number that number is entered, if you don't want that make it readonly...
[09:15:26] <Hplioa> Cork: for example i have a digit number 123456, so i want to put those in seperate inputs so i have 6 inputs, when you enter in the first input it jumps to the seconds with the value on the first one
[09:16:16] <Hplioa> Cork: thats goes correct till the last input, whenever i insert 6 after that if i insert another number is completly removes the 6
[09:16:46] <Cork> it does?
[09:16:59] <Hplioa> Cork: so try on the last input area type 3 numbers you will see it removes the second input
[09:17:06] <Cork> i get the number i entered like 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 67
[09:17:25] <Hplioa> Cork: are you trying it with the new fiddle ?
[09:17:26] <Cork> it doesn't here
[09:17:34] <Hplioa> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/t6fc3md5/1/
[09:17:43] <Cork> ah no i try wit the first link
[09:17:58] <Hplioa> Cork: so what i want in your case i want to it must replace the 6 to 7
[09:19:03] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/u1c0q9r4/
[09:20:11] <Hplioa> Cork: damn :D and how do i do it on the other sections replace the numbers
[09:21:01] <Hplioa> Cork: scenario whenever you have 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 and i want to change the 2 to a 4 it adds it into that input
[10:05:43] <pOua> How can i return all numbers in one string https://jsfiddle.net/mzfyrsg6/
[10:06:40] <Cork> .join(',')
[10:07:22] <pOua> Cork: and without "," ?
[10:07:37] <Cork> you have to have a string there
[10:07:40] <Cork> but you can use ''
[10:07:54] <Cork> then they will be joined as one long number
[10:08:14] <pOua> Cork: ah yes i needed console.log(digit.join("")); thanks
[10:08:27] <pOua> Cork: can i fix this inside the map loop ?
[10:09:12] <Cork> no, cause the map is per element in the array
[10:09:36] <Cork> though if you just want to join it do number.join('')
[10:09:39] <Cork> you don't need the map
[10:10:10] <Cork> cause empty strings will just merge anyway
[10:12:10] <pOua> Cork: hmm i think im doing something wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/t6fc3md5/2/
[10:22:53] <pOua> Cork: why is my join not working ?
[10:23:10] <Cork> phuph: your joining elements not strings
[10:23:17] <Cork> $() is dom elements
[10:23:46] <pOua> Cork: but i get the numbers in a array if i check digit,
[10:24:09] <Cork> $.map($('.number'), function(e) { e.value }).join('') should work
[10:26:17] <pOua> Cork: brah! THANKS!
[10:26:54] <Cork> heh opps missed return in the map call -_-'
[10:27:42] <pOua> Cork: yea i added that let digit = $.map($('.number'), function(e) {         return e.value ? e.value : null     }).join("")
[10:27:48] <pOua> thanks
[10:27:53] <Cork> np
[12:15:31] <jimender2> is there any way to get the value of the image that was clicked in jquery when I do the following
[12:16:15] <jimender2> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/uvCbcZwd/
[12:18:49] <shoky_> jimender2: if you mean the src of the image.. $(this).attr('src')
[12:19:18] <jimender2> and it outputs as a string right?
[12:20:01] <shoky_> yes
[12:21:11] <jimender2> Thank you very much
[12:54:19] <melissa666> Can someone explain to me the syntax here? -->  $('input[name="a_input"]').val()
[12:54:33] <melissa666> why can't I just use $('a_input').val()
[12:56:02] <melissa666> oh lol ... nvm I figured it out. I was using <input type="text" id="a_input"> and didn't realize I was supposed to be using name=
[12:59:56] <pavonia> What's wrong with "id"?
[13:49:45] <taplar> melissa666: <input type="text" id="a_input"> would use a selector of $('#a_input')
[14:13:52] <taplar> :o, youtube knows who i am now on my phone.  went there and they showed me some dubstep, ^_^
[14:13:59] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:14:05] <robertmaxrees> for some reason youtube thinks i speak spanish.
[16:07:40] <jimender2> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/FkRPOWHe/
[16:07:55] <jimender2> any idea why this would not be turning the image gray?
[16:08:40] <taplar> if(id = "sliderGray"){   assignments are 99% always truthy
[16:09:31] <taplar> other than that, i'm not familiar with those css properties
[16:09:49] <jimender2> that was it. Just saw that
[16:10:13] * MassDebates coughs abruptly
[16:10:15] <MassDebates> EXCUSE ME
[16:10:18] <MassDebates> did someone just say.... CSS!?
[16:10:22] <taplar> lol
[16:10:56] <MassDebates> jimender2, codepen?
[16:10:59] <jimender2> yes?
[16:11:04] <jimender2> what is codepen?
[16:11:11] <MassDebates> It seems you'll be needing a bit more than that to apply the filter!
[16:11:35] <MassDebates> codepen is an awesome web-based IDE for quick demonstrations and pared down testcases. A sandbox for developers.
[16:11:48] <jimender2> ok. Will take a look at that
[16:11:56] <MassDebates> jimender2, I'm going to take the liberty of spitting out this link: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/
[16:12:10] <MassDebates> css-tricks is an awesome website. Learn it, use it, love it, live it.
[16:12:21] <MassDebates> You are likely looking for the grayscale()
[16:12:21] <MassDebates>  filter function
[16:12:50] <MassDebates> jimender2, here's an example of a GHEETAR lookin' all grey/gray/greiscale like https://codepen.io/grayghostvisuals/pen/cgFGm
[16:12:59] <MassDebates> Keep kicking ass, jimender2 ! Best of luck!
[16:13:21] <jimender2> my next step is getting multiple bars to work on the image
[16:13:26] <jimender2> they keep resetting
[17:36:36] <mrc0de> This should work right? .. if ( ! $("#someToggle").is(":checked") ) { $("#someOtherCheckBox").attr('checked',false); {
[17:37:00] <Gh0st_Preacher> i'd use prop.
[17:37:11] <mrc0de> I've got 6 checkboxes under a parent checkbox, I'm unchecking all on uncheck of parent, and vice versa
[17:37:21] <mrc0de> ok im gonna try prop cuz this produces wierd results
[17:37:27] <Gh0st_Preacher> heh
[17:37:41] <mrc0de> it works, but only on checkboxes I havent manually toggled
[17:37:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:38:30] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle or something?
[17:39:12] <mrc0de> son of a bitch, that fixed it
[17:39:31] <mrc0de> is prop better for some reason I should know about?
[17:40:14] <taplar> prop changes the DOM
[17:40:27] <mrc0de> gotcha
[17:40:29] <taplar> it accesses the underlying property on the dom element
[17:40:34] <mrc0de> <3 u guys
[17:40:46] <taplar> attr() is changing the elements attributes
[17:46:36] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:19:20] <Sky_Scraper> hi guys, I'm super new to javascript and nodejs, I'm using npm and successfully spawn a reverse proxy server which proxy the calls from an html page to every website I want, using: request.("url-requested-from-the-html-page").pipe(res), my problem is: I successfully can spawn and navigate to websites from my browser using express-http-proxy or http-proxy, but I really can't understand how make them take as target argument the
[18:19:20] <Sky_Scraper> url coming from an html page request. I'm really lost, any body have some hints on how to do it?
[18:20:05] <taplar> ask in ##javascript
[18:20:29] <taplar> nodejs is off topic for the room, so you're more likely to find help in there, or pointers to a nodejs room
[18:20:38] <Sky_Scraper> sorry
[18:20:47] <taplar> np, just trying to help you get help, :)
[18:21:29] <Sky_Scraper> I already asked also there, my html page sends an AJAX request to the nodejs server so I thought it wasn't too much offtopic
[18:22:36] <taplar> if the question is about sending an ajax request, with jQuery, that's one thing, and on topic.  If the question is how to make node handle it, that's another thing, and off topic
