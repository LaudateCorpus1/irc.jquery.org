[13:34:45] <tona> hello everyone , how could I change the title here using jquery <button disabled id="search-packages" href="#" class="btn-orange ibm-btn-sec ibm-btn-white gray-disabled" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">
[13:38:14] <tona> i tried to use , jQuery('search-packages').prop('title', 'your new title');
[13:38:27] <tona> but the new title never come
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> the title attribute?
[13:39:56] <robertmaxrees> .prop() works, it just doesn't update the markup.
[13:40:05] <robertmaxrees> you can read it back out using .prop('title');
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> so console.log(jQuery('search-packages').prop('title'));
[13:42:21] <tona> it is telling me undefined
[13:43:06] <makr8100> .attr('title', value) should work
[13:43:33] <tona> ok
[13:49:19] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/wd730yxb/ for any reason doesnt work neither prop nor title
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> also: 'search-packages' is not a valid selector.
[13:52:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sh5a3twL/1/ tona
[13:53:09] <robertmaxrees> check out https://stackoverflow.com/a/5876747/923919 for why you want prop and not attr more often than not.
[13:55:08] <tona> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[14:02:05] <makr8100> agreed now that I read that, never knew that before
[14:02:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:17:33] <RoseBus> hello, when using  $().clone() method on an <input type='text'> which has a input from  user, will clone also copy the user's input
[14:17:51] <robertmaxrees> check out https://api.jquery.com/clone/
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> especially the big yellow box :)
[14:20:51] <RoseBus> ahh thx robertmaxrees
[14:22:57] <RoseBus> so in my function i would need to put some extra lines in to copy the user input data
[14:23:12] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:23:28] <robertmaxrees> start from the top and reread the docs :)
[14:23:59] <RoseBus> robertmaxrees, you're so mysterious
[14:24:06] <RoseBus> making me dig for information
[14:24:08] <RoseBus> lol
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> the docs show you exactly what you need to do :shrug:
[14:25:37] <makr8100> rtfm man, rtfm...  lol
[14:25:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:26:15] <RoseBus> u talkin 'bout [,deepWithDataAndEvents]
[14:26:17] <robertmaxrees> a big part of why i push people to the docs is to help you build that habit.  then you don't have to wait.
[14:26:25] <RoseBus> yea yea i know
[14:26:42] <RoseBus> my project is 90% html/django
[14:26:50] <robertmaxrees> and? lol
[14:26:57] <RoseBus> im no good with js
[14:27:00] <RoseBus> i get impatient lol
[14:27:09] <robertmaxrees> only wait to get better is through doing.
[14:27:16] <robertmaxrees> learning to navigate the docs is easy
[14:28:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u8qdx9p3/2/
[14:28:59] <robertmaxrees> you're welcome ;)
[14:30:29] <RoseBus> okay robertmaxrees here's where my confusion was
[14:30:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:31:44] <RoseBus> my follow-up question was going to be why it isn't copying user-data
[14:31:54] <RoseBus> after setting .clone(true,true)
[14:32:02] <RoseBus> i expected it to, but it wasn't
[14:32:38] <RoseBus> turns out, dropdown list state / selection is not being copied, but text input was
[14:33:04] <RoseBus> i was only trying the dropdown, so the .clone() method _would have_ copied text input if i tried,
[14:33:26] <RoseBus> so now i need to add a line or two to change the state of the new dropdown
[14:34:17] <robertmaxrees> wait
[14:34:25] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is specifically a dropdown?
[14:35:02] <RoseBus> now it is, yes
[14:35:44] <RoseBus> a <select> to be explicit
[14:35:48] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:36:37] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you'd need something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u8qdx9p3/5/
[14:37:44] <RoseBus> ty
[14:38:26] <RoseBus> jsfiddle is nice
[14:39:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.  test cases are awesome.  part of why they're mentioned in this channel's "Asking Good Questions" doc
[14:42:57] <RoseBus> oh geez
[14:43:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:43:21] <RoseBus> i broke all the etiquettes
[14:43:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:43:30] <robertmaxrees> most people do ;)
[14:46:26] <kiwi_792> hi, can can i figure out which button was used in the submit function? http://jsfiddle.net/2bd9rjcq/
[14:47:20] <robertmaxrees> kiwi_792 that's a strange thing to want to do.
[14:47:30] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to know which butted was clicked?
[14:48:08] <robertmaxrees> *button
[14:49:53] <kiwi_792> i want to call 2 different requests to a server
[14:49:59] <kiwi_792> depending which button triggered it
[14:50:13] <kiwi_792> is it so strange? :)
[14:50:17] <robertmaxrees> can you flesh out your example to better demonstrate your use case?
[14:50:27] <robertmaxrees> it is!  there's a reason it's not a simple thing to do :)
[14:51:04] <kiwi_792> i press the button a, than some sniffing on local server will run and return data, i press button b, than sniffing accross x server will run and return data back
[14:51:20] <kiwi_792> local vs. multiple nodes
[14:51:38] <robertmaxrees> then really you want one button and use a radio to select each one.
[14:51:50] <robertmaxrees> or two discrete forms.
[14:52:37] <kiwi_792> i want to reuse the same form
[14:52:51] <robertmaxrees> then use a radio to flip between the two options :)
[14:52:53] <kiwi_792> a button would be nicer
[14:53:23] <robertmaxrees> two buttons is going to be more complex :shrug:
[14:53:27] <kiwi_792> is a button so difficult?
[14:53:38] <kiwi_792> i added value in the button
[14:53:41] <kiwi_792> just check it?
[14:53:47] <robertmaxrees> doesn't work that way.
[14:53:52] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to cancel the submit and then bind two click handlers.
[14:54:04] <robertmaxrees> and use those to fire your requests instead.
[14:54:07] <kiwi_792> interesting
[14:54:14] <robertmaxrees> which is obviously kind of awkward.  just the way the DOM works.
[14:54:41] <robertmaxrees> hence why I'd highly suggest radio buttons instead.
[14:56:06] <RoseBus> in django u always know what button was pressed ezpz
[14:56:09] <RoseBus> :P
[14:56:19] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[14:56:28] <robertmaxrees> and we're not talking django, we're talking DOM :)
[14:56:55] <robertmaxrees> well, jQuery.  but you get what i mean.
[14:56:56] <kiwi_792> how to check the radio button value?
[14:57:00] <kiwi_792> with jquery?
[14:57:55] <robertmaxrees> $('.foo[name="bar"]:checked').val();
[14:58:06] <robertmaxrees> what is this "sniffing"?
[14:59:43] <kiwi_792> recording traffic
[14:59:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:01:10] <kiwi_792> robertmaxrees bar seens to be the radio button, what is foo .... the form?
[15:01:30] <robertmaxrees> .foo is a class you should apply to those radios.
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> you could leave off the name=, come to think of it.
[15:02:43] <kiwi_792> $('[name="option"]:checked').val(); ?
[15:02:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd favor a class over an attribute selector.
[15:03:56] <kiwi_792> i should add class to the radio button?
[15:04:01] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:04:30] <kiwi_792> class="radio"
[15:04:42] <robertmaxrees> give it a descriptive name
[15:04:49] <kiwi_792> like that?
[15:04:51] <robertmaxrees> like what the radio is selecting
[15:05:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hgwez985/4/
[15:12:19] <kiwi_792> is the .val() returned a string?
[15:12:23] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:12:35] <kiwi_792> so i can to string compare to check whats used
[15:12:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:12:48] <robertmaxrees> how do you compare strings, you mean?
[15:14:58] <robertmaxrees> ^ try updating that fiddle to show me what you're trying to do.
[15:34:49] <kiwi_792> hi is $.post(...) part of jquery?
[15:36:18] <robertmaxrees> yep
[15:36:19] <kiwi_792> im trying to send a post request to a remote server but nothing seems to happen... it works fine when i set it to local....
[15:36:48] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[15:37:38] <kiwi_792> http://ideone.com/J7GCah
[15:37:41] <kiwi_792> here is how i send it
[15:38:24] <kiwi_792> i need to add error handling
[15:39:28] <robertmaxrees> check your console - any errors there?
[15:39:38] <kiwi_792> let me see
[15:41:04] <kiwi_792> Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://some-remote-server:7070/requestSnifferInternal' from origin 'http://some-remote-server:7070' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
[15:41:14] <kiwi_792> :D
[15:41:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:41:26] <robertmaxrees> do you control the remote server?
[15:41:28] <kiwi_792> so i need to set this header?
[15:41:31] <kiwi_792> yeah
[15:41:37] <kiwi_792> i can curl it from the server
[15:41:41] <kiwi_792> with no error
[15:41:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, CORS
[15:41:54] <kiwi_792> CORS?
[15:42:16] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS :)
[15:42:57] <kiwi_792> i need to do a change on the server too?
[15:43:01] <kiwi_792> which i send the request to?
[15:43:08] <robertmaxrees> the server is the only thing that needs a change.
[15:43:38] <kiwi_792> the backend you mean?
[15:43:50] <robertmaxrees> whatever server you're hitting, yes.
[15:43:58] <kiwi_792> but why it works with curl than?
[15:44:21] <robertmaxrees> if you read the page i just linked, it explains that it's a security feature of web browsers.
[15:44:26] <robertmaxrees> CURL is not a web browser :)
[15:44:27] <kiwi_792> im on server x and send the curl post request to server y (remote) ... same what happens in the browser
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same, though.
[15:44:43] <kiwi_792> does curl set a header?
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:44:53] <robertmaxrees> please read the page i linked.
[15:44:57] <robertmaxrees> it explains the way in depth.
[15:45:18] <kiwi_792> https://flaviocopes.com/golang-enable-cors/ ...
[15:45:29] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[15:45:36] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[15:46:19] <kiwi_792> give up?
[15:46:45] <kiwi_792> that link refers the the server
[15:46:50] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:46:57] <RoseBus> what does ':last' mean in a query
[15:46:57] <robertmaxrees> the server is where the configuration needs to be changed.
[15:47:15] <robertmaxrees> CORS is a feature that impacts web browsers.  The server has to explicitly allow it, though.
[15:47:23] <robertmaxrees> RoseBus you mean like $('.foo:last')?
[15:47:36] <RoseBus> robertmaxrees, precicesly
[15:47:56] <robertmaxrees> per https://api.jquery.com/last-selector/, "Note that :last selects a single element by filtering the current jQuery collection and matching the last element within it."
[15:48:01] <robertmaxrees> but also that it's deprecated.
[15:48:13] <robertmaxrees> or rather, will be, as of 3.4
[15:48:29] <RoseBus> uh oh
[15:48:36] <RoseBus> i gotta stop using this stack overflow crap lol
[15:48:42] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[15:48:53] <robertmaxrees> always check the API docs if you don't know something./
[15:49:03] <robertmaxrees> SO is great, but not always up to date.
[15:49:21] <RoseBus> :last-of-type i think is the new version
[15:49:28] <robertmaxrees> it isn't.
[15:49:34] <robertmaxrees> it's not equivalent.
[15:49:45] <robertmaxrees> you want to move away from leaning on complex selectors.
[15:49:57] <RoseBus> ooo
[15:49:59] <RoseBus> .last()
[15:50:09] <robertmaxrees> ^ alternatively, learn how to use .filter()
[15:50:48] <robertmaxrees> which is basically what everything else leans on when reducing selections down on some predicate anyway.
[21:03:45] <kiwi_79> hi, is it allowed to use post in jquery like that? http://ideone.com/uO4ZeW
[21:03:57] <kiwi_79> and display the result ?
[21:04:41] <kiwi_79> is the success = function(data){ executed before $("#sniffedData").html ?
[21:12:28] <kiwi_79> success = function(data){ seems to be a callback function
[21:14:21] <kiwi_79> i could display the data on each success call...is there a better recommended way?
[21:57:02] <kiwi_79> any recommendations?
[22:34:04] <kiwi_79> hi?
[23:20:24] <pavonia> kiwi_79: Yes, the AJAXs requests are asynchronous, so the code below may be executed before the request finishes. You should handle the rendering in the success handler
[23:23:21] <pavonia> kiwi_79: Also have a look at promisses and the examples here https://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[23:38:45] <kiwi_79> what about defining a:
[23:38:51] <kiwi_79> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/13e79b0aef7e665e519aba68da3b0cd2/pasted.txt
[23:39:10] <kiwi_79> and than do: myPost(currUrl,JSON.stringify(jsonData), function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) { ... }
[23:39:23] <kiwi_79> is that a blocking call?
[23:39:28] <kiwi_79> meaning synchroniz?
