[00:27:02] <diegoviola> hi
[00:27:16] <diegoviola> what jquery function should i use to make a ajax call when losing focus on input? blur?
[00:27:31] <Cork> diegoviola: uh
[00:27:40] <Cork> the same you would use any other time
[00:32:12] <diegoviola> ok ty
[00:43:50] <DelicateFlower> is $(a).prop('name') the same as a.name?
[00:44:31] <Clex> DelicateFlower: no.
[00:45:08] <Cork> uh
[00:45:11] <Cork> yes it is actually
[00:45:35] <DelicateFlower> ok who do i believe?
[00:45:53] <Cork> .attr is get/setAttribute
[00:46:08] <Cork> and .prop is the property of the dom element meaning elm.<property name>
[00:47:24] <Clex> DelicateFlower: I'm looking for a couter-example.
[00:47:46] <DelicateFlower> ok ill wait
[00:49:16] <systemfault> lol
[00:49:31] <Cork> DelicateFlower: this is the code in jquery return hooks && "get" in hooks && (ret = hooks.get( elem, name )) !== null ? ret : elem[ name ]
[00:49:32] <systemfault> Cork is right..
[00:49:44] <Cork>  elem[ name ] <--
[00:49:52] <Neon> I've setup a minimal test page for testing changing a page with the pagecontainer widget from jquery-mobile 1.4.1. http://firzen.neon-gaming.de/tmp/pgcnt/ I get a weird error that toPage was not defined. I don't know what I did wrong or rather how to use the pagecontainer correctly. Can you help me?
[00:50:25] <DelicateFlower> so they are the same?
[00:50:28] <Cork> i can link the source if you want
[00:50:38] <DelicateFlower> what about .prop and .attr?
[00:50:43] <Cork> yes a.name and $(a).prop('name') is exactly the same
[00:50:52] <Cork> attr is set/getAttribute
[00:50:58] <Cork> it is totally different
[00:51:12] <Neon> The script is at http://firzen.neon-gaming.de/tmp/pgcnt/test.js if you'd like a quick direct link.
[00:51:15] <Cork> attr grabs the raw string from the dom element
[00:51:22] <Cork> .prop grabs the browser modified value
[00:51:51] <Cork> DelicateFlower: a good example of the difference is testing href of <a href="test.html">
[00:51:52] <DelicateFlower> how often will the result be different?
[00:51:52] <Clex> DelicateFlower: Cork is indeed right, sorry.
[00:52:09] <Cork> attr returns "test.html"
[00:52:26] <Cork> and prop returns "http://example.com/path/test.html"
[00:52:32] <Cork> or even better
[00:52:41] <Cork> <a href="#target">
[00:52:41] <systemfault> Another classic..... the "disabled" attribute
[00:52:48] <Cork> attr returns "#target"
[00:52:54] <Cork> and prop returns "http://example.com/path/test.html#target"
[00:53:07] <Cork> well and checked and all state values
[00:53:15] <Cork> as attr won't give you browser state
[00:53:44] <DelicateFlower> so if i want to get the attribute name of an element what do i use?
[00:53:54] <Cork> attribute name?
[00:54:01] <Cork> ah
[00:54:05] <Cork> both works
[00:54:10] <Cork> name doesn't have state
[00:54:16] <Cork> so prop an attr will give you the same string
[00:56:41] <DelicateFlower> what about getattribute?
[00:56:51] <Cork> what do you mean?
[00:57:03] <Clex> DelicateFlower: I have a shitty counter-example though : http://jsfiddle.net/tPA6e/1/
[00:57:09] <Cork> elm.getAttribute('name')
[00:57:11] <Neon> Okay, I just had to use $.mobile.changePage instead of the .pagecontainer stuff. :S Nvm.
[00:57:19] <Cork> elm.setAttribute('name', 'value')
[00:57:32] <Cork> its the same as $(elm).attr('name')
[00:57:40] <Cork> $(elm).attr('name', 'value')
[00:58:14] <nhqe> Hi guys, I have a full page hero which needs to move upward off the screen and reveal the article list underneath, what would be the best way about going to do this?
[00:58:19] <Cork> DelicateFlower: an element that isn't in the page canät have scroll
[00:58:25] <Cork> and it doesn't have overflow
[01:02:52] <Cork> Clex: http://jsfiddle.net/tPA6e/2/
[01:03:39] <Cork> opps directed the second last comment to the wrong nick :x
[01:03:51] <Cork> Clex: the comment for DelicateFlower up there was for you
[01:04:50] <rethus> i have replaced jquery-ui 1.8.3 with 1.10.4. now i got "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dialog' ".
[01:05:11] <rethus> but if i look inside the 1.10.4 file, I see in the head-comment:
[01:05:12] <Cork> rethus: sounds like you either added it in the wrong place
[01:05:13] <Clex> Cork: it was juste an exemple, you can use any instance of the object I guess : http://jsfiddle.net/tPA6e/3/
[01:05:20] <Cork> or you don't include the full jquery ui lib
[01:05:21] <Clex> *example
[01:05:35] <rethus> * Includes: jquery.ui.core.js, ..........jquery.ui.dialog.js,
[01:05:58] <rethus> I copy this: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.4/jquery-ui.min.js
[01:06:21] <rethus> it's from here: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide?hl=de#jquery-ui
[01:07:34] <rethus> Cork:  what you mean with wrong place.
[01:07:48] <Cork> rethus: jquery ui might be before jquery
[01:07:56] <rethus> in this cms it was added on a file named jquery-ui, and i replace the content of this file
[01:08:05] <rethus> ahh, ok
[01:08:12] <rethus> I'll check this
[01:09:44] <Cork> Clex: that is cause jquery will downcase the strings http://jsfiddle.net/tPA6e/6/
[01:11:32] <rethus> Cork: if i put it infront of jquery, i got an error in ui on line 6:
[01:11:39] <rethus> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[01:12:14] <Cork> rethus: ok, what i meant is <script src="jquery"><script src="jquery-ui"><script src="jquery">
[01:12:23] <Cork> so it is mainly if you include two copies of jquery
[01:12:37] <Cork> (something you shouldn't do)
[01:12:46] <Cork> but i've seen it quite often as a problem
[01:12:59] <rethus> so it have to be after jquery, but no additional jquery have to be loaded, right?
[01:15:12] <Clex> Sorry that's the best I could come up with.
[01:15:16] <Cork> rethus: ya
[01:17:42] <_genuser_> anybody have a clear idea how to control the UI for the "close" button. I create a dialog with jquery UI and when I show it, it shows a button on the top left that says "Close".
[01:18:54] <Cork> _genuser_: not sure what you mean
[01:19:10] <Cork> if you mean apply the normal ui styling  it's from the css rules
[01:19:37] <_genuser_> $("#AddRigDIV").dialog({ autoOpen: false });
[01:19:44] <_genuser_> that's to create my dialog.
[01:19:48] <Cork> ya?
[01:20:03] <_genuser_> I have a custom div with only one <input type=button> that I want shown.
[01:20:17] <_genuser_> $("#AddRigDIV").dialog("open");
[01:20:32] <Cork> (tip use <button> not <input type="button">)
[01:20:33] <_genuser_> that shows a second btton just above my div. the button says "close"
[01:21:13] <Cork> not sure what .dialog() has to do with this
[01:21:31] <Cork> if you want to style the button add the css classes needed to it
[01:21:39] <_genuser_> I'm curious how the second button is added to the UI. I didn't add it.
[01:21:50] <_genuser_> so I would guess jquery UI is adding it.
[01:22:05] <Cork> please make a running example in jsfiddle.net
[01:22:21] <_genuser_> ah, that will take me a while. but let me try that. :)
[01:22:43] <Cork> shouldn't be too much time if all you need is a jquery ui dialog
[01:23:00] <_genuser_> you underestimate my n00b ness.
[01:28:51] <_genuser_> Cork: done. how does one share it?
[01:29:10] <Cork> _genuser_: hit save and then copy the new url
[01:29:22] <_genuser_> http://jsfiddle.net/9Ldsu/
[01:30:00] <_genuser_> when you hit Add a Rig link, it will how the dialog and on the top right it says, "close"
[01:30:27] <_genuser_> in this one it's a link. on my server it's a button. either way, I am not adding it. and I'm not sure how to control it's UI, visibility, etc.
[01:32:27] <Cork> ah
[01:32:44] <Cork> ya, i had to fiddle with that one my self in a project
[01:32:58] <Cork> _genuser_: it is the close button from the title bar in the dialog
[01:33:15] <Cork> simplest is prob just to hide the titlebar
[01:33:27] <Cork> (as you arn't using it)
[01:33:40] <_genuser_> It's a good reminder to me to add a freakin' close button.
[01:33:56] <_genuser_> lol.
[01:34:26] <_genuser_> unfortunately the docs seemed a little thin on teh subject. I didn't see anything different in teh samples that adds the title bar, etc.
[01:34:32] <_genuser_> and why "close" instead of the "x".
[01:34:41] <Cork> _genuser_: http://jsfiddle.net/9Ldsu/1/
[01:34:48] <Cork> _genuser_: there isn'
[01:35:02] <Cork> * there isn't a way to control that button from prefs to .dialog
[01:35:15] <Cork> i had to extend jquery ui dialog to do it
[01:35:30] <Cork> but here it's prob simpler to just hide the bar like i said
[01:35:51] <_genuser_> .ui-dialog-titlebar
[01:35:55] <Cork> _genuser_: but honestly
[01:35:59] <_genuser_> I see that's the thing that hid it.
[01:36:05] <Cork> why do you need jquery ui dialog?
[01:36:26] <Cork> what you have should be easy to do without the dialog plugin
[01:36:30] <_genuser_> never done it before. new to jquery. oppurtunity to write somethign useful for my use AND learn some jquery.
[01:36:50] <Cork> _genuser_: i meant that should be doable with just css
[01:37:00] <_genuser_> oh you're thinking just show teh div on my own using JS onclick, etc?
[01:37:01] <Christer> Hello everyone :) Has anyone come across a jQuery library or something that would help me make a container with absolute positioned elements into responsive elements? :) I have created a mapping application with a free-form drag-and-drop that lets user drag elements on to the container and its set using absolute position. and now im trying to make it responsive. :)
[01:37:08] <Cork> no need for js for anything other then showing the content
[01:37:23] <Cork> _genuser_: kinda, but please don't use onclick
[01:37:44] <_genuser_> Cork: what 's the proper thing to use, then?
[01:37:55] <Cork> use event listeners
[01:38:07] <Cork> $(target).on('event name', function() {})
[01:38:18] <_genuser_> oh I see.
[01:38:23] <Cork> or if you want to go native js elm.addEventListener('event name', function() {})
[01:38:34] <_genuser_> Cork: is that something jquery specific or is that javascript specific.
[01:38:42] <Cork> note though, you should NOT mix native event listeners and jquery ones
[01:38:44] <_genuser_> talking about the $(target).on(....)
[01:38:52] <Cork> that is jquery
[01:39:01] <Cork> on is a jquery function
[01:39:23] <_genuser_> ok, that's what I thought. but there was the chance that javascript has improved since I last learnt to do js stuff. which was 2001.
[01:39:52] <nhqe> hey Cork, do you have a minute spare?
[01:39:53] <Cork> _genuser_: addEventListener is the same things as the basic on
[01:39:56] <_genuser_> I think I really spent time reading up javascript in 2001-2003'ish. since then it's just hacks of .onClick(), etc.
[01:40:03] <Cork> nhqe: just ask the question
[01:40:09] <nhqe> okay
[01:40:14] <Cork> _genuser_: heh
[01:40:18] <Cork> ya onclick haven'
[01:40:26] <_genuser_> Cork: good to know. I think I'll stick with jquery event listeners since I'm trying to learn jquery. :)
[01:40:33] <Cork> *'t been a thing since ~ 2001
[01:40:41] <_genuser_> hehe
[01:40:44] <nhqe> I have a full height hero div, with content positioned absolutely underneath, I need the hero div to move upward and off the screen on scroll, but there are no scrollbars as everything is 100% height
[01:41:14] <_genuser_> Cork: I was actually using jquery UI dialogs hoping it would dim the background and make it unclickable while showing my dialog and I woudln't have to do all that. lol.
[01:41:21] <nhqe> is that possible?
[01:41:35] <Cork> nhqe: you can bind a scroll event listener to the page and move the div when the event fires
[01:41:39] <Cork> hmm
[01:41:42] <Cork> actually
[01:41:51] <nhqe> but the scroll event won't fire without actually scrolling, will it?
[01:41:53] <Cork> ?api mouseweel
[01:41:53] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[01:41:58] <Cork> ?mdn mouseweel
[01:42:00] <b-ot> Cork: mousewheel - Mozilla Developer Network â https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/mousewheel
[01:42:09] <Cork> nhqe: ^ that is the event you want to bind
[01:42:19] <nhqe> would this work for trackpads
[01:42:22] <nhqe> ?*
[01:42:27] <Cork> no
[01:42:35] <Cork> there you would have to bind the touch events
[01:42:44] <nhqe> god.. why do designers make things so complex
[01:42:46] <Cork> ?mdn touchmove
[01:42:48] <b-ot> Cork: touchmove - Mozilla Developer Network â https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/touchmove
[01:42:57] <Cork> nhqe: it isn't really
[01:43:20] <Cork> nhqe: sure you could add an element that actually can scroll and use the scroll event :)
[01:43:39] <Cork> but as it is two totally different and fairly incompatible things they need to be different
[01:43:45] <nhqe> are these events for JS or jQuery?
[01:43:52] <Cork> both
[01:44:09] <Cork> jquery mainly use native events except for a few faked events
[01:44:19] <Cork> like mouseenter mouseleav hover and so on
[01:44:23] <Cork> *leave
[01:44:35] <nhqe> mousewheel isn't supported in Firefox?
[01:44:49] <Cork> quite sure it is
[01:44:59] <Cork> ugg
[01:45:01] <Cork> wrong event
[01:45:07] <Cork> damn... what was the correct name...
[01:46:56] <Cork> nhqe: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/wheel
[01:47:04] <Cork> no mouse infront :)
[01:47:08] <nhqe> these touch events are totally out of my league :(
[01:47:39] <Cork> it isn't that hard
[01:48:28] <nhqe> I don't understand it :/
[02:05:59] <rethus> If i scroll the page, before open my modal, the Layover-Layer doesn't fit the page: http://storage7.static.itmages.com/i/14/0226/h_1393409209_7643320_7632c6dcb8.jpeg
[02:06:05] <rethus> why?
[02:07:13] <beachandbytes> rethus just use css position fixed on the overlay
[02:07:24] <beachandbytes> position:fixed;
[02:07:31] <Cork> ya, it has position absolute by default
[02:07:43] <Cork> to work with old ie versions that doesn't support fixed
[02:14:53] <diegoviola> how do i remove all the \t\t\t\n\n from the string i'm sending via an ajax call?
[02:15:08] <diegoviola> i'm doing $(this).text(); currently
[02:15:18] <Cork> replace(/[\t\n]/g, '')
[02:15:35] <Cork> or if you want just the exact combo
[02:15:38] <diegoviola> isn't there another way
[02:15:45] <Cork> not really
[02:16:10] <Cork> if it is at the start or end you could use $.trim()
[02:17:09] <diegoviola> ty
[02:24:45] <rethus> beachandbytes: thanks, works like a charm
[02:31:31] <Rita_opu> hi folks
[02:32:05] <Rita_opu> I have an external JS (which I cannot modify) and I need to load it using $.getScript
[02:32:35] <Rita_opu> the JS file contains a similar code where it uses node.parentNode where node give the script tag
[02:32:55] <Rita_opu> as $.getScript removes the tag after execution
[02:32:58] <Rita_opu> it get null
[02:33:25] <Rita_opu> is there anyway to retain the script tag in body when it is called via $.getScript
[02:33:33] <Cork> no
[02:34:02] <Cork> and i think it is normally added to head
[02:34:09] <Cork> not body
[02:34:48] <Rita_opu> is there any workaround to retain the tag in head?
[02:35:42] <Cork> var tag = $('<script src="target">'); $(document.head).append(tag);
[02:36:02] <Rita_opu> thanks Corks
[02:36:03] <Rita_opu> but
[02:36:07] <Rita_opu> i need also callback
[02:36:24] <Rita_opu> tag.on("load", function() ... ) works but not in IE
[02:36:27] <Cork> var tag = $('<script src="target">'); tag.on('load', function() {}); $(document.head).append(tag);
[02:36:34] <Cork> hmm
[02:39:59] <Cork> Pitel_IPEX: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/script.js#L39
[02:40:13] <Cork> hmm though that is the wrong version
[02:40:14] <Cork> one sec
[02:40:33] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.x-master/src/ajax/script.js#L45
[02:40:44] <Cork> there that is the old ie compatible version
[02:42:06] <drager> Can you make animations faster on a mobile phone? Because I think they are slower on a phone
[02:42:30] <Cork> drager: best solution is normally to use css3 animations
[02:42:43] <drager> Yeah, I figure
[02:44:01] <drager> Cork: Maybe something like this? http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[02:44:23] <Cork> drager: eh, ya possibly
[02:44:34] <dwarder> guys anyone debugs in chrome? when i debug a file instead of the filename i see  VM1605 + the filename, what does this VM mean?
[02:44:37] <Cork> i just add the animations to the css file and don't do any js code for it
[02:45:07] <Cork> dwarder: file instead of a filename?!?
[02:45:13] <drager> Cork: Yeah, but what happens if the browser doesnt support them?
[02:45:17] <drager> Nothing, right?
[02:45:26] <Cork> drager: you don't get any animation, it just jumps
[02:45:26] <drager> == No animations?
[02:45:30] <drager> yeah
[02:45:31] <Cork> ya
[02:45:42] <drager> hm
[02:45:49] <Cork> and normally animations shouldn't be important enough to have to have js fallback
[02:46:17] <drager> I have an js app and when you presses an button it changes "page"
[02:46:20] <drager> with an animation
[02:46:37] <Cork> if the browser is old enough to not support css3
[02:46:45] <Cork> it most likely can't make a fluent animation
[02:46:45] <dwarder> Cork: in the sources i selected myjs.js and set a breakpoin here, when i fire up the function instead of selected file i seeVM1605 myjs.js
[02:46:50] <drager> Cork: Ah
[02:46:52] <Cork> so you are prob better of just snapping in the new page
[02:47:01] <dwarder> Cork: and the debuger goes through this file
[02:47:45] <dwarder> Cork: and i can't edit this file as i can with myjs.js
[02:47:45] <drager> Cork: What do you mean?
[02:48:00] <antiPoP> HI, I have an issue. i have a plugin which returns a jquery object. The object should be just a single element, but I get an array. Looking at the array with firebug i see the single element I need highlighted. How can I select just that element with my code?
[02:48:15] <antiPoP> i can post a firebug screenshot if needed
[02:48:32] <Cork> drager: you make the animation happen with css, and if the option isn't supported you just don't get the animation
[02:48:45] <drager> Cork: Alright, thanks
[02:48:51] <Cork> drager: the effect is as if the animation steps was skipped from the start to the end position
[02:50:06] <Cork> dwarder: what do you mean by opening the function?
[02:50:42] <Cork> (the reason i'm asking is cause i've never seen what you talk about)
[02:51:26] <Cork> antiPoP: by definition jquery is an array
[02:51:28] <dwarder> Cork: fire up, i.e. i clicked on something
[02:51:40] <Cork> antiPoP: if you want the unwrapped raw dom element return jqobj[0]
[02:51:56] <Cork> though then you can't use jquery functions on it without wrapping it again
[02:52:07] <dwarder> Cork: i think i
[02:52:08] <Cork> ah
[02:52:17] <dwarder> Cork: i have something similar to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17367560/chrome-development-tool-vm-file-from-javascript
[02:52:22] <Cork> now i at least understand what you talk about :)
[02:53:02] <antiPoP> Cork, teh issue is that whne I use tha jqUery object, all the element in side that are selected, and I just what one
[02:53:02] <dwarder> :)
[02:53:06] <antiPoP> let me uplaod an screenshot
[02:53:25] <Cork> antiPoP: so pick the one you want
[02:53:30] <Cork> ?api eq
[02:53:30] <b-ot> Cork: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[02:53:42] <antiPoP> but that depends on the user selection
[02:53:43] <Cork> antiPoP: but you will always have an array
[02:53:51] <Cork> antiPoP: what?
[02:53:51] <antiPoP> teh question is: how firebug selects teh one Ineed?
[02:53:56] <antiPoP> wait..
[02:54:04] <Cork> antiPoP: jquery is an array
[02:54:06] <Cork> period
[02:54:22] <Cork> firebug just shows the content of the array
[02:56:30] <Cork> dwarder: can't reproduce
[02:56:45] <talin> hello. i want to retrieve some sort of query string from an url. can i use jquery for that?
[02:56:50] <Cork> dwarder: is the script loaded through js (require.js, $.getScript or similar)?
[02:57:31] <Cork> talin: not natively no
[02:58:01] <Cork> talin: window.location.search will give you the string though
[02:58:10] <Cork> you need to parse it your self if you want
[02:58:24] <talin> Cork: ah, so regular js
[02:58:57] <antiPoP> Cork: see this http://www.mediafire.com/view/13u48jsrm22y54t/firebug.png
[02:59:34] <Cork> antiPoP: ok?
[02:59:53] <Cork> antiPoP: what is the problem i don't get what you want to do
[03:00:29] <Cork> you want to filter out the ones firebug isn't graying out?
[03:00:37] <antiPoP> Inteh screenshot you see an arrqy, but the elemt I'm interested in is highlighted by firebug. How can I select that element with jquery
[03:00:51] <Cork> jqobj.filter(':visible')
[03:01:04] <Cork> the elements that doesn't have display: none
[03:01:06] <antiPoP> ok, thanks :)
[03:01:16] <Cork> though you should prob set a class for it instead
[03:01:21] <Cork> makes the code cleaner
[03:06:46] <tmroland> hi
[03:06:56] <tmroland> http://www.developerdrive.com/2013/07/using-jquery-to-add-a-dynamic-back-to-top-floating-button-with-smooth-scroll/
[03:07:04] <tmroland> it says to add some css code. but where do i  add it it doesn't say
[03:07:12] <tmroland> anyone can give a hint?
[03:07:45] <Tomashe> Hey guys. i got a json that looks like that { "image" : "pic.jpeg" } , now i use that code to make it an object , put a new element and then convert it into string again.
[03:07:46] <Tomashe> but i got error
[03:07:47] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/8Sphz/
[03:07:55] <antiPoP> Cork, the issue is that i'm using a plugin, and I would need to modify the source... filter, actually solved the issue :)
[03:08:08] <Tomashe> "has no method unshift"
[03:08:36] <FrEaKmAn_> hi .. how could I get iframe src after iframe has changed?
[03:08:51] <plepzz> Tomashe: I don't think you can use unshift on a object, it only works on arrays
[03:09:13] <FrEaKmAn_> the problem is when I navigate in iframe, the src="... doesnt update for $('iframe').attr('src') is not working
[03:09:35] <Cork> ?api prop @ FrEaKmAn_
[03:09:35] <b-ot> FrEaKmAn_: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[03:10:02] <Cork> FrEaKmAn_: attr is for reading the attribute, and yes that doesn't change with the browser state
[03:10:36] <Cork> FrEaKmAn_: also cross domain there is additional blocks
[03:10:44] <Cork> and i think reading the src is one of them
[03:10:52] <FrEaKmAn_> Cork: cross domain is not problem
[03:11:28] <Tomashe> plepzz: really?!
[03:11:36] <Cork> Tomashe: yes
[03:11:37] <plepzz> Im quite sure
[03:11:42] <Tomashe> hmm
[03:11:44] <Cork> objects arn't arrays
[03:11:55] <Cork> obj.<key name> = value
[03:11:57] <Tomashe> so how can i put a nother element inside my object
[03:12:13] <Tomashe> ok ok so maybe i will make an array of objects
[03:12:16] <Cork> or obj['key name'] = value
[03:12:18] <Tomashe> that will solve my issue
[03:12:49] <Cork> Tomashe: also an object can't hold two keys with the same name
[03:13:03] <Cork> so ya it sounds like you want an array to hold your objects
[03:15:06] <Tomashe> THANKS
[03:15:32] <bristleback> how can i change the name of a key in an object?
[03:15:48] <Cork> you add a new key with the correct name and remove the old
[03:16:11] <bristleback> Cork: thanks! this is my currenct solution
[03:16:28] <Cork> js> var obj = { key1: true }; obj.key2 = obj.key1; delete obj.key1; print(JSON.stringify(obj))
[03:16:34] <bristleback> it works, but do you know if I can do it some other way?
[03:16:34] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:16:57] <Cork> bristleback: you could create a new object and copy all values to the new object :)
[03:17:05] <Cork> bristleback: there is no key rename for objects
[03:17:09] <bristleback> that is not a viable option
[03:17:13] <bristleback> thought about that too
[03:17:17] <Cork> didn't say it was :)
[03:17:47] <ska-fan> $('#product_variants').find('table').first().children('tbody').children('tr') can this be shortened somehow without resorting to sizzlejs?
[03:17:57] <bristleback> no, I meant it is not a viable option in my case, not from a good practice point of view
[03:18:09] <Cork> ('#product_variants').find('table').first().find('tr')
[03:18:13] <ska-fan> Problem is that the tables may be nested and I want just the outer one
[03:18:14] <bristleback> but it's doable
[03:18:44] <Cork> bristleback: ya, creating the new key and removing the old is the best; and basically the only option
[03:18:45] <ska-fan> Cork: just the tr's of the outer table
[03:18:56] <bristleback> ok
[03:18:57] <bristleback> thanks
[03:19:17] <Cork> ('#product_variants').find('table > tbody').first().children()
[03:19:35] <Cork> ska-fan: though that will still find the inner tables
[03:19:42] <Cork> you prob want children on the first too
[03:19:52] <Cork> ugg
[03:19:57] <Cork> that won't work
[03:20:31] <Cork> ('#product_variants').children('table').first().children().children() is prob the best you can do
[03:20:55] <Cork> ska-fan: or just give a class or id to the table
[03:21:03] <ska-fan> that might get me stuff in the table's caption
[03:23:04] <ska-fan> ok, thanks :)
[03:31:08] <Kingsy> if I do something like --> $('element').click(function() { <-- it binds the event ok, however if that function runs again without a page reload the click event is bound to the element twice, so one click executes the function twice.. how can you stop this?
[03:32:49] <diegoviola> how can i improve this code or make it shorter? https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/6a2640885d2129c4c962
[03:32:57] <diegoviola> it's just an ajax call
[03:35:13] <Cork> diegok: $.post('/title/update',{ title: $(this).text(), id: $(this).parent().attr('id') })
[03:35:35] <Cork> *diegoviola:
[03:36:01] <Cork> diegoviola: also just to be sure remember that $('div[contenteditable=true]').blur isn't generic
[03:36:11] <Cork> uh... *dynamic
[03:36:28] <Cork> so if you change contenteditable later through code it won't affect what elements this is affecting
[03:38:09] <diegoviola> Cork: thanks
[03:50:53] <drager> Cork: Now I got it working more beautiful with css3 :3
[03:50:56] <drager> Thanks for the help
[03:51:00] <Cork> np
[03:55:59] <Sendoushi> hey guys. how does jquery handle unescaping and such?
[03:56:24] <Cork> unescaping?
[03:56:29] <Cork> you mean html?
[03:57:04] <Sendoushi> yes
[03:57:08] <Cork> it doesn't
[03:57:14] <Cork> the dom does that
[03:57:27] <Sendoushi> lets say some smartpants gets to an input field something like <script>destroyEvetything()</script>
[03:57:36] <Sendoushi> and you'll render this later on
[03:57:52] <Cork> then you will run the script
[03:58:11] <Cork> if you append it with .html() or .append (or the likes)
[03:58:22] <Cork> .text() will take it as text not html
[03:58:39] <Sendoushi> so... text() may be a good solution
[03:59:13] <Sendoushi> is there a way to "convert" something to text mode?
[03:59:14] <Cork> well if the user input goes through a server it should be filtered there
[03:59:23] <Sendoushi> i have 4 variables separated by <br> on a string
[03:59:26] <Cork> and the user can run scripts from the console if they really want to
[03:59:34] <Sendoushi> i want <br> to be html but the address strings not
[04:00:01] <Sendoushi> that is something i«m trying to explain here. api should be the guy to take care of these kind of things
[04:00:40] <Cork> Sendoushi: the server should always be the one securing these things yes
[04:00:53] <Cork> Sendoushi: you can enable csp on the site if you want the browser to help you
[04:01:24] <Sendoushi> that's what i'm trying to explain but in this case we're not the guys doing the api and they're kind of scared
[04:03:32] <mooru> When i load my page, the there seems to be a jump between the dom load and jquery load. How do i make it such a way that there is no delay and it loads instantly
[04:04:38] <Sendoushi> mooru, are you loadng the jquery on the head?
[04:05:09] <mooru> <Sendoushi> Its loaded like that in the cms
[04:05:56] <Sendoushi> mooru, what about the main script you're using?
[04:06:02] <Sendoushi> is it in the footer?
[04:06:18] <mooru> <Sendoushi> no?
[04:06:22] <Sendoushi> if you want that to be "instantly" you should provide the scripts at the header
[04:06:46] <Sendoushi> then inside the script you should use $(document).ready()
[04:07:01] <Sendoushi> if that doesn't work... it depends too much on the project to help
[04:07:25] <mooru> <Sendosuhi> OK
[04:11:08] <Cork> mooru: do you see the content before jquery loads?
[04:12:33] <mooru> <Cork> it loads before the content ie jquery
[04:12:39] <Cork> ok
[04:12:50] <Cork> jquery should never be anywhere but in the document head
[04:13:09] <Cork> cause it has a few things it needs to do before body starts parsing
[04:13:23] <xec> Cork: that's news to me
[04:13:55] <Cork> xec: if you want ready to actually work you need it for example
[04:14:45] <xec> is this some quirky IE edge case scenario?
[04:18:35] <xec> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/q2a9b/ seems to work everywhere I test, and the first sample at http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/ includes jquery at end of <body> (before other scripts)
[04:31:19] <xqo> hi, how can i center #middle, and make #right and #left stretch across the screen so they fill the remaining space horizontally? http://jsfiddle.net/Rnkgd/

[04:53:58] <Xoro> Hello?
[04:59:04] <Zenger> Hi guys, assuming I have a variable called HTML with some html in it. How can I run a selector inside this HTML if the element doesn't exist on the dom yet ?
[04:59:20] <Zenger> I think it worked in older version where I did something like jQuery('.selector', HTML )
[05:01:38] <decx> put it in a fragment
[05:01:50] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/7EgeR/
[05:03:50] <decx> ah yes, using the string as context still works
[05:03:59] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/7EgeR/1/
[05:04:01] <Zenger> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/E4ptX/ , am I doing something wrong ?
[05:04:16] <Xoro> So, I'm trying to replace the src attribute of a <img> like this: $("#stage").attr("src", "page[i]"); but when it runs it tosses me "page[i]" as a text value. Rather than the URL to the image in the index of the array.
[05:04:43] <Zenger> Xoro: because you're supplying the "page[i]" param as a text
[05:04:51] <Zenger> Xoro: try , $("#stage").attr("src", page[i]);
[05:05:20] <Xoro> I did but that returns nothing. The click function only works if it's in quotes.
[05:06:15] <decx> Zenger p can't be found because it's in the root of html
[05:06:42] <Xoro> Okay, now it works. I swear I tried that 5 separate times tonight and just now it's making me look stupid.
[05:07:01] <Zenger> decx: Do you mean the selector has to be very specific ?
[05:07:30] <decx> yes, find('span') would work in your case for example
[05:07:42] <decx> to target the p you'd have to filter('p')
[05:08:04] <xqo> decx a fixed middle with fluid sidebars
[05:08:38] <Zenger> decx: thanks, it seems to work now
[05:09:08] <decx> xqo look into display: flex
[05:09:40] <xqo> ok thank you
[05:10:10] <decx> Zenger technically you did g $('p').find('p span'); it's looking for p inside the p
[05:10:36] <decx> because p is a root element of your html string
[05:11:39] <Zenger> decx: Yeah, well the problem in my working code was even worse, I had an undefined error and it failed to select anything. I didn't check the selector and that's why the string as context didn't work in the first place. But thanks for the info ;)
[05:12:05] <decx> well thanks for reminding me that i can use html strings as selector context ;)
[05:12:55] <Zenger> decx: It's the little things ^_^
[05:13:59] <decx> too bad you can't change the string with something like $('#stuf ,myhtml).text('newtext'), i would never use a template again :>
[05:16:32] <Xoro> Now that I got the biggest hump out of the way. How do I set up the src in the markup so it links to the array? If I start it with the image it's supposed to start with; the image is displayed twice after pressing the button.
[05:20:29] <decx> what?`
[05:23:02] <Xoro> There's a first page to this 'album' I'm making. I want to start it on the first page. I know I can use the same method once at the beginning of the jQuery with .attr to set it, but I'm wondering if there's a more proper way by calling the value in the markup. src=array[i] doesn't work. With or without quotes.
[05:25:25] <decx> i still don't get it
[05:25:37] <decx> are you trying to access array in your html markup?
[05:25:42] <Xoro> Yes.
[05:25:52] <decx> not going to happen
[05:26:26] <Xoro> So the only way is to set the first image before the click functions?
[05:26:59] <decx> you can trigger a click after you bound your click function
[05:27:11] <decx> blah.on(click,fn).trigger('click')
[05:29:56] <Xoro> I already have the .click working. I was just wondering the best way to start the first image. Setting the value of the attribute before that function seems the only way to me.
[05:39:09] <zim> Hi all. if I .. var data = $(this).data(); How can I use data as a get string in .ajax({ data:: data, .......
[05:39:25] <zim> I just seems to escape it all
[05:44:12] <zim> Sorry that should be .ajax({ type: "GET", data: data, <- How to NOT escape this and turn it into a nice get string
[05:45:34] <madalin> Can someone point me to the right dirrection where i can read on how to ADD to a json key only the value ?
[05:59:02] <xec> zim: what does the data var contain?
[06:00:16] <andywww> $($('.hook_ranking')[count]).html();
[06:00:49] <andywww> how do i chose the nth element in an array a selector returns?
[06:00:53] <andywww> as an object?
[06:01:01] <Cork> ?api eq
[06:01:01] <b-ot> Cork: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[06:01:03] <andywww> a jquery object, sorry
[06:01:20] <andywww> an, thank you
[06:01:45] <Cork> zim: you normally don't want to do this; but you can set processData to false
[06:03:07] <xec> madalin: what is a "json key"?
[06:03:27] <xec> madalin: the name of a property?
[06:03:49] <decx> it's like in heavy rain, press x to json
[06:03:55] <madalin> xec: yep, that was it. But i somehow got lost in arrays.. lol. I fixed now by adding only the values separated by comma ;)
[06:15:16] <OsMonkey> Can anyone help a newbie with a simple AJAX problem?!?
[06:18:29] <koneko> OsMonkey, just ask, don't ask whether you can ask
[06:34:23] <blodymary> any idea why im getting Cannot call method 'split' of undefined  in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/VDnND/75/
[06:37:12] <Cork> blodymary: most likely cause what you try to split isn't a string
[06:37:41] <blodymary> Cork: need to parse it?
[06:37:46] <Cork> blodymary: hmm
[06:37:56] <Cork> you know you can have the date object do this for you right?
[06:38:19] <Cork> date.getHours() date.getMinutes() date.getSeconds()
[06:38:35] <Cork> ah you stopped using the date object
[06:38:43] <blodymary> Cork:  right
[06:39:19] <Cork> in what situation do you get the error?
[06:39:55] <blodymary> Cork:  when i load the page
[06:40:08] <decx> the function is called once on load so result will never change
[06:40:41] <Cork> i don't get any errors here
[06:40:58] <blodymary> Cork: in the fiddle?
[06:41:01] <Cork> yes
[06:42:34] <decx> blodymary http://jsfiddle.net/decx/VDnND/76/
[06:42:53] <blodymary> weird
[06:43:05] <decx> works fine if there'S already data in there, but as the function that sets result is only called once on load that doesnt matter when you change
[06:44:49] <blodymary> decx:  is right
[06:45:27] <blodymary> guess thats why im getting undefined

[07:12:07] <adf2323fff> Hi, I'm having what I bealive is quite a unique problem that I'm been trying to wrap my head around for hours now.  I have a list om <img> tags in the DOM. I have aother list of <img> tags in a generated variable. I'd like to replace the ones in DOM where the src has changed by fading out the old and fading in the new. This is not very hard, except that the lists also are sorted based on an attribute "sort_order" which isn't the sa
[07:13:05] <andrew9183> adf2323fff: can you jsfiddle an example ?
[07:13:09] <adf2323fff> There can be gaps in this "sort_order" and I need to only replace (with fade), add (with fade) in right position, and remove (with fade) to/from DOM without affecting all the images, just the ones that differ from my variable
[07:15:05] <adf2323fff> working on a fiddle
[07:19:04] <learning> can someone spot the error in this ? http://pastebin.com/Y05Fup2m
[07:19:29] <adf2323fff> http://jsfiddle.net/f6zvW/
[07:19:42] <adf2323fff> There seems to be to many condtiions to keep it simple
[07:20:35] <vernonk> @learning One way would be to create a fragment and then add it at the end.  Right now, you're creating a ul with a single list item on each piece. Is that what you're looking for?
[07:20:39] <adf2323fff> Like if any or both lists are empty, it should fade out all or fade in all images, if any image has the same sort_order attribute but different src the img in DOM should fade out to be replaced with new image fading in in same position.
[07:21:39] <learning> vernonk: what i'm after is to like iterate the 10 latest posts into the listview not sure if that is what i'm doing :P
[07:22:36] <learning> so in short each item shall be in a seperate listview spot.
[07:22:44] <learning> if that makes any sense
[07:23:23] <vernonk> check this out: http://jsbin.com/zociv/1/
[07:24:21] <vernonk> That's a really simple example. One piece to keep in mind is that since you're dynamically adding it, it won't get enhanced by jQuery Mobile right away. You'll need to use the `refresh` method to get the enhancements.
[07:26:24] <vernonk> Scratch that... you'll actually need to instantiate it since it never existed.
[07:26:52] <vernonk> But important to remember... once you have a jQM widget instantiated if you add items dynamically you'll need to call the refresh method on the widget.
[07:28:22] <learning> vernonk: mind linking me notes on the refresh method so i can read up on it ?
[07:29:03] <vernonk> Sure thing: https://api.jquerymobile.com/listview/#method-refresh
[07:29:49] <learning> thnaks!
[07:29:52] <vernonk> Also, that doesn't only apply to listview's. The way jQM auto-enhances these widgets require a refresh if you dynamically modify.
[07:29:54] <vernonk> Sure thing!
[07:50:39] <learning> vernonk did u leave ?
[07:54:37] <BillCriswell> I feel like getting help in #jquery is like 10x easier than any other channel.
[07:54:55] <learning> harder u mean :p
[07:55:01] <decx> that's because we'er so awesome
[07:55:28] <BillCriswell> learning: No damn way.
[07:55:38] <BillCriswell> decx: Agreed. We rule.
[07:55:53] <BillCriswell> Very easily sidetracked, but mostly awesome.
[07:57:57] <decx> talking about sidetracked, 2d collision detection & basic movement on canvas if anybody's interested in that sort of thing http://jsfiddle.net/decx/rbpsv/show/
[07:59:07] <BillCriswell> decx: I have no idea what's going on here lol
[07:59:58] <decx> move, jump around, fire green go, press e to put a collision block at the cursor
[08:00:01] <decx> that's about it ;)
[08:00:05] <decx> green goo*
[08:01:20] <BillCriswell> I feel like I'm on acid.
[08:02:09] <decx> yeah i should put a rand function on the background color as well ;)
[08:04:26] <learning> can someone tell me what i've missed in my code
[08:04:27] <learning> http://pastebin.com/Gv5epqRd
[08:04:50] <learning> i should be refreshing into each listview item but not doing so :/
[08:04:59] <learning> it**

[08:06:38] <decx> maybe you grabbed the fruity loops from the wrong cupboard this morning
[08:06:38] <rina> BillCriswell: thats a bit harsh.. LOL
[08:06:57] <BillCriswell> It's just really hard to read.

[08:08:24] <learning> vernonk: http://pastebin.com/Gv5epqRd
[08:09:23] <vernonk> Sorry about that... yeah, I mentioned above that the refresh is useful knowledge but since this is brand new you'll need to instantiate it.
[08:09:37] <learning> ohhhhhhh
[08:10:00] <vernonk> Yeah, that's my bad for not being clearer.
[08:10:25] <vernonk> You can call the listview plugin on any selector like any jQuery object method: `$( "#accordion" ).listview();`
[08:10:39] <vernonk> Sorry for the backticks... too much markdown. :)
[08:11:20] <learning> vernonk: i'm a bit confused now
[08:11:21] <learning> :(
[08:11:21] <learning> :P
[08:13:52] <BillCriswell> learning: http://jsbin.com/domubula/1/edit?js Here is how I think you want your code formatted... You seem to have it in the middle of some HTML in your paste so I'm not positive.
[08:14:40] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/domubula/2/edit
[08:16:20] <learning> BillCriswell: that does not add it too each listview item
[08:17:40] <BillCriswell> You should set up a live example, not 100% sure on what you're going for.
[08:18:13] <learning> BillCriswell: it's an latest 10 feed items each goes into it's own row/field in an listview
[08:18:49] <BillCriswell> learning: Right.
[08:18:54] <wunz> learning, what give an example of a feed
[08:18:55] <learning> nvm
[08:18:57] <learning> solved it
[08:18:57] <learning> :D
[08:18:57] <wunz> at least one string
[08:19:13] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:19:16] <wunz> good ;p now you can change your nick to 'learned'
[08:19:17] <wunz> :)
[08:19:22] <learning> :D
[08:19:37] <learning> i'm always learning!
[08:19:38] <learning> :D
[08:19:39] <learning> so no
[08:19:44] <learning> ^^
[08:20:23] <learning> not sure if this is good practice but i just did $('#accordion').trigger('create'); too make it load/create/refresh and it did ?
[08:20:28] <learning> any notes ??
[08:21:57] <decx> isnt that the same as $('#accordion').accordion() ?
[08:22:13] <learning> not going for accordian
[08:22:28] <learning> the div is still named just that cause i had it as accordian before
[08:22:30] <learning> :))
[08:22:37] <learning> miss-leading i know
[08:22:42] <decx> well create whatever then ^^
[08:22:49] <learning> ;)
[08:23:49] <decx> if it works, it works
[08:23:56] <learning> atleast doc said to refresh dynamic use refresh or trigger for the listview and vernonk said i had to instantate it that is what i got from it not sure but it works so if no one has anything else then yeah ;)
[08:23:59] <decx> hide it in a cupboard and don't touch it ever again ;)
[08:24:00] <learning> ^^
[08:24:34] <learning> just smile and move on as they say
[08:24:34] <learning> :D
[08:26:34] <vernonk> learning.... sorry about that
[08:26:39] <vernonk> Here you go: http://jsbin.com/zociv/2
[08:26:52] <vernonk> Take a look, I put a setTimeout in there so you could see the list built and then the listview widget kick in.
[08:27:27] <vernonk> The reason the call to $( "#accordion" ).listview() doesn't work is because that's not your listview itself.
[08:27:40] <vernonk> Your selector would be more like $( "#accordion ul[data-role='listview']" )
[08:27:44] <vernonk> or something along those lines
[08:27:50] <vernonk> or... even just $( "#accordion ul" )
[08:28:44] <learning> vernonk: this is what i have atm and it works http://jsbin.com/wutilezi/1/edit
[08:28:49] <learning> solved it with a trigger
[08:30:08] <vernonk> Yeah that works because the 'create' event causes the auto-enhancement.
[08:31:00] <vernonk> You may already be doing this but you could separate those pieces out a bit so they each were functions or methods of their own responsibility. One to get the data, one to build the listView.
[08:31:05] <vernonk> *listview
[08:33:28] <learning> vernonk: yeah will do that
[08:33:55] <learning> but one more question when it addeds in the list it loads for a while can i show an indicator just to let ppl know it's loading ??
[08:37:05] <d0de> Any advice on how I could refactor this code? I know it's really ugly but I don't know what to do about it. http://jsfiddle.net/RFLFH/
[08:38:01] <duch_kazatel> d0de woah.  i can give some tips.
[08:38:12] <decx> this has more stacked ifs and else ifs than my collision detection :o
[08:38:42] <d0de> yeah it's pretty bad. This code is repeated like 9 more times with different variables
[08:38:55] <duch_kazatel> so first things first, you can combine multiple var declarations using a comma.  and don't newline your "else ifs" like that.
[08:38:57] <d0de> because I couldn't work out the scope issues of making it a function
[08:39:27] <decx> hehe been there done that d0de
[08:39:42] <duch_kazatel> so here's a place to start: http://jsfiddle.net/RFLFH/1/
[08:40:03] <duch_kazatel> d0de also, don't use ==.
[08:41:09] <OsMonkey> Can anyone help a newbie with as to why my variables arn't appearing in my php script please?!? http://codepad.org/36rZd8zY
[08:41:23] <decx> had to diff to find what you changed there duch lol
[08:41:33] <duch_kazatel> :) small changes are important in this case.
[08:42:04] <duch_kazatel> d0de now down in your chunk of else ifs at the bottom of your code, that's the common factor there?
[08:42:10] <duch_kazatel> *what's the common factor?
[08:42:26] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I presume it's better to use === instead?
[08:42:31] <duch_kazatel> d0de yes.
[08:42:34] <duch_kazatel> always use ===
[08:42:40] <duch_kazatel> unless you really know what you're doing.
[08:42:45] <d0de> OK
[08:42:48] <vernonk> learning: sorry keep stepping away. Yeah, but you would probably want to do that with the Ajax call itself. Store the request in a variable and then tie into the promise that comes back.  So, before the request add a class to your accordion area that shows a loading state. Then, you can use the done state to remove the class and add your items.
[08:43:21] <duch_kazatel> d0de do you know the difference between the two?
[08:43:21] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I didn't quite understand your last question. Would it help if I linked an example of how the code is repeated?
[08:43:34] <learning> vernonk: thanks!
[08:43:41] <vernonk> Sure thing!
[08:43:49] <duch_kazatel> d0de nope - my poing was that you're always running rainslider.slider("refresh");
[08:44:03] <duch_kazatel> *point
[08:44:30] <decx> the common thing is rainslider.val() you can use a single one of those and do checks in there
[08:44:33] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I do roughly, yeah
[08:44:50] <decx> rainslider.val(function(){ if blah -> return blah })
[08:45:04] <suidakra> does anybody know why I can't set a val on an input box in a modal?
[08:45:11] <suidakra> Im using a callback function
[08:45:15] <duch_kazatel> d0de http://jsfiddle.net/RFLFH/2/
[08:45:54] <d0de> duch_kazatel, that makes a lot of sense, thanks
[08:46:21] <d0de> it only ever needs to be called at the end, I see that
[08:46:41] <soahccc> why does this lead to an illegal invocation error? console.log.apply(this, ["a", "b"])
[08:46:41] <duch_kazatel> d0de now the next thing to poke at it how you're basically running a bunch of comparisons, but you do things like rainCurrentVolNum - rainLowInterval repeatedly.
[08:47:36] <duch_kazatel> soahccc i'm not getting an error.
[08:47:44] <d0de> yes, I could simply create a var, that makes sense
[08:48:11] <soahccc> duch_kazatel: I use chrome, you too?
[08:48:16] <duch_kazatel> d0de now you said you're having a hard time understanding scope, right?
[08:48:19] <duch_kazatel> soahccc firefox.
[08:49:09] <soahccc> duch_kazatel: Hmm it works in firefox but not in chrome :( some policy shit I'm afraid
[08:49:14] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I think I kind of understand it, I just have trouble getting around it. The operation in the fiddle, I do that on about 10 different elements. Rain is the first, Thunder is the 2nd etc
[08:49:32] <duch_kazatel> soahccc no, it's because that's now how console.log.apply works for chrome.
[08:49:33] <duch_kazatel> console.log.apply(console, ['message']);
[08:49:46] <duch_kazatel> d0de holy wow.
[08:49:53] <d0de> Originally I wrote this as a function I called with different parameters for each slider, but I rain into problems with scope
[08:49:58] <d0de> yeah, I know :\
[08:50:03] <duch_kazatel> d0de scope is simple :) let me cook up an example for you.
[08:50:44] <soahccc> duch_kazatel: ohh okay thanks, I just found this information tooâ¦ :)
[08:51:30] <d0de> duch_kazatel, the main problem was a variable called flip, which tells me if I'm going out from the middle or towards it. This whole thing in a setInterval, and the flip variable has to persist for each element between calls, but also be editable from inside the function
[08:52:01] <duch_kazatel> d0de then that fix is easy - declare it in the highest combined parents scope.
[08:52:08] <decx> sounds like brainmelting complexity, love it
[08:52:50] <d0de> the solution I came up with, which is stupendously ugly, but works, is to declare a global variable outside the setTimeout to hold the value of each flip in
[08:53:00] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/YqTgC/1/
[08:53:02] <d0de> so, like, rainFlip, thunderFlip etc
[08:53:13] <duch_kazatel> so that's scope in JS/.
[08:53:34] <d0de> but it seemed like it wasn't possible to edit this flip variable from inside a function when the same variable was passed to the function as an argument
[08:54:16] <duch_kazatel> d0de ah, no, because vars that are references to arguments are only in that scope.  in that case, an object/properties might be smart.
[08:55:01] <d0de> duch_kazatel, that's where my inexperience shows. I have not used objects before, hence my inappropriate reliance on simple vars
[08:55:12] <duch_kazatel> actually, you're all ready using objects :)
[08:55:18] <duch_kazatel> javascript is almost entirely objects.
[08:55:55] <decx> duch_kazatel when i do object literal, can i fake a local scope for the object? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5h3Wm/
[08:57:20] <duch_kazatel> d0de so look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/BtHeq/
[08:57:49] <d0de> duch_kazatel, thank you, will investigate
[08:57:50] <duch_kazatel> decx aaaah.  nope.
[08:57:53] <shoky> decx you can use this.newvar
[08:58:07] <duch_kazatel> true - you can use this, but you have to give scope.
[08:58:35] <decx> is this. faster than calling myobject. ?
[08:58:47] <decx> shouldnt make a difference should it
[08:58:57] <duch_kazatel> i don't think so.  shoky might know better than i do.
[08:59:14] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I can see how this works, thank you!
[08:59:26] <shoky> decx no, since  this === myobject
[08:59:39] <decx> i read that i can define a return function for the parent object but that seems overly complicated
[08:59:41] <d0de> I could just create an object to hold the flip value for each slider
[08:59:49] <d0de> as in, one object
[09:00:15] <decx> i'll stick with obj.var.var.var.var then ;)
[09:00:25] <duch_kazatel> d0de you could do that, sure.
[09:00:38] <duch_kazatel> d0de it entirely depends on your architecture.
[09:01:25] <duch_kazatel> d0de as your application grows, though, it might be nice to have stuff like rainSlider.getVal();
[09:04:40] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I see what yo umean
[09:05:49] <d0de> in a big chain of else-ifs like this, does the browser exit the chain as soon as it meets a condition that fits?
[09:06:52] <duch_kazatel> i don't remember.
[09:06:56] <duch_kazatel> i don't think so.
[09:07:00] <d0de> if (1===1) { console.log("1")} else { someEnormousCalculation() }
[09:07:08] <duch_kazatel> or rather, it does maybe?
[09:07:15] <d0de> will the calculation ever be done? I'm wondering from a performance point of view
[09:07:31] <duch_kazatel> the compilers probably optimize that so they won't be done.
[09:07:45] <d0de> ok
[09:08:02] <duch_kazatel> I think in a series of if/else if/else, it "exits" as soon as it finds the relevant branch, but I could be wrong.
[09:09:40] <OsMonkey> Can anyone help a newbie with as to why my variables arn't appearing in my php script please?!? I'm 99% sure the variables are getting to the php script, but don't think there being converted, can anyone see where i've gone wrong please? http://codepad.org/36rZd8zY
[09:10:08] <duch_kazatel> OsMonkey are you getting errors in the JS console?
[09:10:31] <d0de> duch_kazatel, thank you so much for taking the time to help me with my code, I am very grateful
[09:10:33] <duch_kazatel> OsMonkey you might want to ask a PHP channel for help.
[09:10:49] <duch_kazatel> d0de of course.  it's what we do here.  always be learning :)
[09:12:44] <OsMonkey> I don't think i'm getting any errors in the console, no
[09:13:01] <duch_kazatel> OsMonkey it sounds like your question is about PHP, not javascript.
[09:13:04] <duch_kazatel> or jquery
[09:14:06] <OsMonkey> Think you might be right as I can't see anything wrong with the other bits. How do I swape over to a php channel?
[09:14:37] <duch_kazatel> you use /join ##php
[09:15:02] <decx> i think you have to register you name to visit #php
[09:15:10] <duch_kazatel> wouldn't surprise me.
[09:15:19] <OsMonkey> Perfick! Thank you Duch_kazatel! Most appreciated!
[09:15:55] <decx> and yes, afaik if else if else exits on the first hit
[09:17:07] <duch_kazatel> cooooode review time.
[09:17:12] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/tJGu8/
[09:17:31] <decx> not really a scientific test though ^^
[09:17:35] * BinaryKitten dislikes "else if"
[09:18:00] <duch_kazatel> you can definitely avoid them, but sometimes they are unavoidable.
[09:18:55] <BinaryKitten> just more that i've been taught never to do if (xxxxxx) something();
[09:19:03] <BinaryKitten> more if (xxxxx) { something(); }
[09:19:24] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:19:35] <BinaryKitten> so "else if" is breaks that.. as in my head should be "else { if (xxxxx) { something(); } } "
[09:19:44] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[09:19:55] <duch_kazatel> yeah, short-circuit as much as possible.
[09:20:06] <duch_kazatel> put the more common case earlier in your checks, etc.
[09:21:24] <decx> is there a noticable difference from not using else if?
[09:21:30] <FernandoBasso> I need to prevent some characters from being entered in an input field: http://jsfiddle.net/Gra6q/ <-- What is wrong here?
[09:21:33] <decx> apart from all the curly brackets
[09:22:11] <decx> first of all you want to check the event keydown
[09:22:25] <decx> because keyup is after the fact
[09:22:41] <duch_kazatel> also: don't use .delegate() - it's deprecated.  use .on()
[09:23:12] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('keydown', '.numeros-apenas', function(){});
[09:23:16] <shoky> superceded! ;p
[09:23:48] <duch_kazatel> also target lower than document if possible.
[09:24:39] <FernandoBasso> It still won't prevent some the characters from being inserted.
[09:26:21] <duch_kazatel> after the keydown event, check the keycode and prevent the default action when appropriate.
[09:26:30] <FernandoBasso> Works.
[09:26:41] <FernandoBasso> I was inverting the arguments. Thank you all.
[09:29:55] <decx> whatever happened to input type=number
[09:30:01] <decx> still no support in ff
[09:32:50] <NoiseEee> FernandoBasso: you can also use the 'input' event
[09:33:14] <duch_kazatel> or the change event
[09:33:15] <FernandoBasso> Din't know about it. I'll take a look. Thanks.
[09:33:25] <NoiseEee> yeah but change requires a loss of focus on the input
[09:33:36] <NoiseEee> whereas input is immediate, i didn't even know of it until a few months ago
[09:35:19] <decx> yeah input is sweet, but i'd say keydown is still more appropriate here
[09:38:54] <Hell_lol> Hello people, Let's Fart! -- Test
[09:39:39] <Hell_lol> done!
[09:39:48] <Hell_lol> Happy Bot!
[09:40:02] <decx> i had kebab today, don't start what you can't live through
[09:40:12] <decx> with extra onions
[09:40:59] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I don't suppose you're familiar with the node-webkit project are you?
[09:41:01] <Hell_lol> haha, you're funny!
[09:41:57] <Hell_lol> someone kick me .. lolzzzZ
[09:46:21] <duch_kazatel> d0de i've heard of it but haven't used it.
[09:47:01] <d0de> duch_kazatel, ok, thanks anyway. It has this one really annoying bug that I can't find a way around
[09:47:29] <Mattx> hey guys
[09:48:09] <Mattx> I've a really confusing problem..
[09:48:17] <Mattx> my app is generating JS code, it looks like this:
[09:49:13] <Mattx> http://pastebin.com/6bQ8FG2n
[09:49:49] <Mattx> somehow the first <script> works well (that is, the div is inserted just before it)
[09:50:00] <duch_kazatel> don't dynamically generate javascript, fwiw
[09:50:03] <Mattx> but the second <script>, even if it's executed, doesn't insert the <section>
[09:50:24] <duch_kazatel> a full working example in a jsfiddle would be huge, too.
[09:50:36] <Mattx> ok, right, let me do that
[09:51:51] <Mattx> http://jsfiddle.net/kkWm4/
[09:51:51] <decx> $('script').last() doesnt work before load
[09:51:57] <Mattx> damn, it works in jsfiddle u.u
[09:52:21] <Mattx> the real code only "FIRST" is added
[09:52:38] <duch_kazatel> Mattx don't dynamically generate javascript either way.
[09:52:45] <Mattx> why not?
[09:53:13] <duch_kazatel> because you're dynaimcally generating logic unnecessarily.
[09:53:25] <duch_kazatel> decouple your logic.
[09:53:28] <Laire> hm, when I donwolad the last stable version from jquery mobiles and open the demos, thy don't work, because the link to the js files aren't ok
[09:53:42] <decx> change (function() { to $(function() { and it'll work
[09:54:02] <Mattx> decx, what do you mean? it is working in jsfiddle
[09:54:27] <decx> because jquery is loaded in the head
[09:55:16] <Mattx> I'm sorry I did't get it. jquery is loaded in the head, right. if it's not loaded in the header it would work
[09:55:20] <Mattx> neither $(funciton..
[09:55:50] <decx> $(function(){ }) is a shorthand for document.ready
[09:56:08] <decx> (function(){}) is just a selfexecuting function
[09:56:41] <decx> self invoking?
[09:56:44] <decx> self servicing?
[09:56:55] <decx> masturbatory function, yep that's it
[09:57:07] <duch_kazatel> iife
[09:57:13] <duch_kazatel> immediately invoked function expression.
[09:57:24] <decx> yeah i'm gonna go with masturbatory function
[09:57:27] <duch_kazatel> not a self-executing anonymous function, since it's not truely self-executing.
[09:57:29] <duch_kazatel> good call.
[09:59:16] <Mattx> ahh, you mean the inner function
[09:59:20] <Mattx> I was looking at the wrapper with the var current
[09:59:20] <Mattx> :P
[09:59:23] <Mattx> duch_kazatel, the main point of this app is generating code, not generating code would be like not doing the app at all :P
[10:00:03] <duch_kazatel> Mattx what is the actual problem you're solving?
[10:00:10] <duch_kazatel> because code generation is a pretty niche thing.
[10:00:46] <Mattx> right now I'm checking why in jsfiddle it works and in my app it doesn't. I simplified the code so there must be something wrong in the original version
[10:00:53] <hesco> I seem incapable of writing a selector to address the state selector on this page:  http://fyeo.thefamilyconnector.com:8007/concierge/application  I would have thought this would do the trick:  $('.facility-state input[name="inmate.facility_state"]'), but that seems to have no effect.  Can anyone please suggest for me what I'm getting wrong here?
[10:02:00] <decx> well it's not an input
[10:02:03] <decx> it's a select
[10:02:26] <hesco> ah, yes, thanks, trying this again
[10:09:57] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel:  hey was this close to where your at http://imgur.com/gallery/1GodEyQ?
[10:10:30] <duch_kazatel> yup.  hit local news before national.
[10:11:40] <BillCriswell> That would be a nice surprise.
[10:13:23] <decx> i know gold doesnt react much to anything but this looks so shiny, you'd think after a couple of years there would be dirt all over it
[10:13:42] <duch_kazatel> yeah the can protected them a surprising amount.
[10:16:06] <iceptic1> hey guys
[10:17:47] <duch_kazatel> hey iceptic1
[10:18:04] <iceptic1> i fixed that issue from last time that no one could figure out
[10:18:11] <duch_kazatel> kay
[10:18:12] <iceptic1> do you remember that duch?
[10:18:15] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:18:21] <duch_kazatel> i barely remember what i had for lunch yesterday.
[10:18:28] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: Come back to rub it in our faces?
[10:18:40] <iceptic1> lmfao ah well and no not come back to rub in your faces :P
[10:18:49] <duch_kazatel> what was the problem?
[10:18:50] <BillCriswell> =D
[10:19:05] <iceptic1> just come back for some help again :( and the problem was when posting type didnt have quotes
[10:20:00] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: I think we need some context cause that statement doesn't make any sense to me.
[10:20:05] <iceptic1> if (!$('input[name=type]').is(':checked')) {  <-- as type didnt have quotes it wasnt picking it up but still unsure as to why
[10:20:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ever write a node module?
[10:20:45] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: The quotes around type there are optional.
[10:21:41] <iceptic1> but how come with no quotes it procuded a weird error in the consol log :S?
[10:22:06] <iceptic1> if there optional (im not having a go at you im just confused as it should of worked lol)
[10:22:47] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: It doesn't make a weird error though.
[10:23:00] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: http://jsbin.com/kirabuxe/1/edit?html,js example
[10:23:36] <iceptic1> on there it doesnt, but within my code it did
[10:23:57] <iceptic1> ill replicate the error for you :P
[10:24:50] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: http://jsbin.com/kirabuxe/2/edit here it is testing is(':checked') as well.
[10:26:26] <iceptic1> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined crew.php:71
[10:26:26] <iceptic1> (anonymous function) crew.php:71
[10:26:27] <iceptic1> (anonymous function)
[10:26:51] <iceptic1> thats the error i get when i remove the quotes off of the type :(
[10:28:28] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: Without seeing the output it's hard to tell, it seems like you have some string concatenation going wrong.
[10:29:04] <BillCriswell> Are you using PHP in your JS?
[10:29:15] <barryhjames> Having trouble loading jQuery UI. Checked the console and it is giving me "event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead." and it is saying that it is coming from jquery-1.8.0.min.js. I don't have a file called jquery-1.8.0.min.js, yet it is popping up in my console.
[10:29:30] <decx> that's just a warning
[10:29:54] <decx> every site has that
[10:30:10] <iceptic1> nah all im doing it a post via ajax
[10:30:10] <iceptic1> do you want a link to the source?
[10:30:29] <iceptic1> *is
[10:30:41] <BillCriswell> I think jQuery is updated in 1.11 to not trigger that notice.
[10:31:32] <decx> even mdn has that warning ;)
[10:32:08] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: No thanks, it's cool. Just clarifying the selector still works with or without the quotes.
[10:32:12] <barryhjames> decx: That's what I read, but my issue seems to be that jQuery UI isn't loading at all, and I can't figure out why. BillCriswell: I am running 1.11.0, so I'm not sure why I am getting the notice. Seems that it is pulling it from a 1.8.0 file, but I don't have that file anywhere on my server.
[10:33:05] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: Are you using any weird plugins?
[10:33:07] <iceptic1> haha ok thanks tho billcriswell :P bill can you help me out with a hover/bind function?
[10:33:27] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: Like Chrome or Firefox*
[10:33:30] <decx> you can put jQuery.ui in the console to check
[10:33:54] <BillCriswell> iceptic1: Maaaaaybe. It depends how clear your fiddle is. =)
[10:35:23] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: The only thing I am using is jQuery, jQuery UI and Modernizr. decx: When I put it in the console, it says that jQuery works fine, but UI isn't loading.
[10:36:12] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: Is it live?
[10:36:27] <BillCriswell> If you look in the Network pane in Chrome do you see the file being requested?
[10:37:34] <iceptic1> Bill: HAHA ill try and make my fiddle very clear :P
[10:37:34] <iceptic1> ive got an array of users online, im wanting to on mouseover(hover) produce a little box beide there name with there profile picture + some other stats, im not to sure about how to go about it i did look at overlib(javascript functions) but wasnt too keen on how it works and not sure if it would work in my situation.
[10:37:39] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: Yes, it is being requested. I am using Grunt to minify all of the js calls together, and the main.js that it is included in is being called.
[10:37:49] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: No, the site isn't live, unfortunately.
[10:38:16] <decx> i'd blame grunt
[10:38:17] <decx> ;)
[10:38:37] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: What do you get if you type jQuery.fn.jquery in the console?
[10:39:01] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: 1.10.1
[10:39:23] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: Hmm... not sure why it is pulling that version number.
[10:39:41] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: How about $.fn.jquery?
[10:40:03] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: Same thing, 1.10.1
[10:40:41] <BillCriswell> Are you sure that 1.8 is generating the error on that page?
[10:41:40] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: Okay, so I just removed the main.js file that I was using with Grunt, and dropped in the sources by themselves, and the problem is fixed. I guess something is happening when the file is getting minified.
[10:42:21] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: That doesn't sound like fun.
[10:42:38] <yashi> How do I make jQuery UI update the URL with some anchor hash tagh whenever an accordion state changes on my site?
[10:42:39] <BinaryKitten> barryhjames are you minifying the minified code?
[10:43:30] <decx> knew it, blame canada... eer grunt
[10:43:47] <BillCriswell> yashi: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#event-activate
[10:44:45] <yashi> BillCriswell: And how do you rewrite the URL?
[10:45:20] <decx> history.pushState
[10:45:26] <decx> don'T bother though
[10:45:29] <decx> it's shit
[10:45:41] <yashi> How do you mean?
[10:46:03] <BillCriswell> yashi: Haha. If you're like to do a redirect of some kind you can do location.href = 'http://newurl.com;
[10:46:04] <decx> brown
[10:46:11] <BillCriswell> location.href = 'http://newurl.com'; *
[10:46:20] <barryhjames> BinaryKitten: Yes, I am. I didn't realize using Uglify to stick those together would be bad. Does it strip code out or something?
[10:46:30] <yashi> BillCriswell: Doesn't that beat the whole purpose of ajax?
[10:46:40] <BinaryKitten> barryhjames no clue
[10:47:00] <yashi> All I want to accomplish is that the user clicks some link, and then the back button, the accordion will go back to its previous state.
[10:47:31] <BinaryKitten> but minify the files separately (yours)
[10:47:39] <BillCriswell> yashi: I was interpreting you wrong.3
[10:47:42] <decx> you say just, but it's a pretty involved function
[10:47:42] <barryhjames> BinaryKitten: Okay, I'll try that now.
[10:47:46] <BinaryKitten> barryhjames then join them all after
[10:47:53] <yashi> Oh?
[10:48:00] <BinaryKitten> minify yours, then merge them together
[10:48:02] <BillCriswell> yashi: You could store the state of it in localStorage maybe.
[10:48:30] <yashi> BillCriswell: But wouldn't it be cool if once the user collapsed some accordion then URL address bar gets #section_3 added to it?
[10:48:39] <decx> you still have to invoke the localStorage manually because history.back doesn'T care about that
[10:49:25] <yashi> then also if someone wants to paste the page URL to someone else, they get to the exact same location
[10:49:42] <BillCriswell> yashi: I guess pushState is your answer. You can try out http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[10:50:01] <yashi> I mean, gmail does this, doesn't it?
[10:50:05] <barryhjames> BinaryKitten: Okay, that worked. Console says that it loaded and all is well. Thanks BillCriswell, decx and BinaryKitten!
[10:50:10] <yashi> shit like https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#all
[10:50:22] <BillCriswell> yashi: I'm familiar with it haha
[10:50:31] <decx> it's certainly doable, but it's not easy as pie
[10:50:37] <BillCriswell> The link I gave you should be able to help you accomplish that.
[10:50:53] <yashi> I'm surprised it's not built into the accordion..
[10:51:08] <BillCriswell> Can't include everything.
[10:51:13] <decx> porting pushstate functionality to older browsers is terrible
[10:51:38] <decx> but with hash you dont even need pushstate i guess
[10:52:02] <BillCriswell> location.href = "#tab-one"; and grab it in the JS with location.hash I suppose.
[10:52:09] <yashi> OK thanks for your help!
[10:52:32] <yashi> BillCriswell: location.href would reload the page, no?
[10:53:12] <BillCriswell> Yeah, would have to look into hash change... Why is this so annoying to do haha
[10:53:34] <BillCriswell> look into the hashchange event*
[10:53:35] <duch_kazatel> window.location.hash = 'athing'
[10:53:36] <barryhjames> Okay, another question. jQuery UI Autocomplete. I have a PHP class and method that pulls names from the database. I want these names to go in the Autocomplete. I know how to link a PHP file to the Autocomplete, but is there a way to use a method from a PHP class and the source?
[10:53:37] <yashi> It's not annoying, but I would like to _not_ reload the page on accordion-tab-click
[10:53:38] <duch_kazatel> doesn't reload the page.
[10:53:54] <yashi> duch_kazatel: Oh that's cool
[10:54:05] <duch_kazatel> pushstates are totally different.
[10:54:11] <duch_kazatel> IE10 and above only.
[10:54:13] <duch_kazatel> iirc
[10:54:17] <decx> yes
[10:54:39] <duch_kazatel> i wrote a pushstate manager once with full hashchange fallback.  it was interesting.
[10:54:46] <decx> i spent 3 weeks on infnite loading a category with products involving pushstate
[10:55:02] <decx> was terrible
[10:55:11] <decx> i now hate infinite loading and prefer a more button
[10:55:12] <duch_kazatel> infinite scrolling, you mean?
[10:55:15] <decx> oh right
[10:55:21] <decx> derped
[10:55:28] <duch_kazatel> we abandoned infinite scrolling.
[10:55:39] <decx> yeah it's nice in theory
[10:55:50] <decx> but such a pain, not that comfortable in the end and prone to errors
[10:55:54] <duch_kazatel> actually, etsy abandoned it because it's hard to get the UX right.
[10:56:06] <duch_kazatel> do ajax driven pagination like a bawse.
[10:56:11] <decx> it also breaks the end key
[10:56:34] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[10:56:35] <decx> "oh now your breakpoint is visible? let's load, let's load let's load let's load"
[10:56:39] <duch_kazatel> oooh yeah.
[10:57:02] <_genuser_> juery UI new dialog. Is there a way to cancel it by clickon on the overlay background?
[10:57:09] <_genuser_> or should I just add that event handler myself.
[10:58:23] <decx> you can add it to the overlay create function
[10:58:27] <decx> or whatever it's called
[10:58:28] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-hide
[10:59:31] <decx> from stack _genuser_ http://jsfiddle.net/jurchiks/R944y/1/
[11:00:28] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: I see. I was asking if I should just do what you posted. as opposed to just "enabling" something while creating the dialog that would automatically do this.
[11:00:41] <_genuser_> difference being that I'm adding more and more code. that I need to then track
[11:00:54] <duch_kazatel> looks like decx's answer should be helpful.
[11:01:19] <_genuser_> yeah, I"m reading it now.
[11:01:23] <_genuser_> it looks nicely contained.
[11:02:44] <_genuser_> decx: the .widget part is new to me.
[11:03:20] <_genuser_> decx: what does that change. I was using just the $('div').dialog({}) part. to show and hide the dialog.
[11:03:59] <duch_kazatel> anybody here know much about sass?
[11:04:10] <_genuser_> you need somebody to be sassy?
[11:04:13] <_genuser_> :p
[11:04:30] <decx> _genuser_ i never used it much, but .widget just extends existing functions or creates new ones
[11:05:14] <decx> i installed sass and vowed to use it, but i'm single on most projects so it doesn't make sense and adds another layer of complexity i don't need
[11:05:20] <_genuser_> decx: I see. it looks like it customizs the ui-dialogs that you will create else in your code.
[11:05:43] <mary89> decx:  i came across with this solution from this morning but it doesnt seem to parse to String http://jsfiddle.net/VDnND/79/
[11:07:04] <decx> didnt i do that like 5 hours ago mary89 ?
[11:07:11] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/VDnND/77/
[11:07:41] <shoky> _genuser_ yeah and if you give it a different name you can have your own custom widget without affecting other dialogs http://jsfiddle.net/R944y/4/
[11:08:36] <mary89> decx: is it necessary to set the value of inputs?
[11:08:49] <decx> not anymore
[11:10:04] <_genuser_> shoky: I see that's pretty cool.
[11:10:34] <_genuser_> shoky: problem I"m seeing it that the examples always load an overlay. the gray background. in my app the same code isn't loading an overlay.
[11:10:37] <_genuser_> frustrating.
[11:10:56] <shoky> _genuser_ you can style the overlay to be transparent
[11:11:50] <shoky> _genuser_  http://jsfiddle.net/R944y/5/
[11:12:43] <andrewanderson> i'm having trouble having hammer swipe events to register in a mobile browser, it works fine with regular browser, i can't find anything on google on it
[11:14:37] <andrewanderson> http://white-harbor-rails-78206.use1.nitrousbox.com/#areas/1/hazards -> works fine on chrome, firefox, but not chrome in android
[11:14:45] <_genuser_> shoky: well, I want it to show. just the like your previous example.
[11:16:37] <shoky> _genuser_ oh. welp i'd need to see it to figure out the problem
[11:16:59] <shoky> _genuser_ do you have modal: true
[11:18:32] <_genuser_> shoky: yep, modal is true.
[11:18:44] <_genuser_> shoky: let's see if it doesn't work, I'll port it to jsfiddle
[11:19:06] <shoky> you can try looking for the .ui-widget-overlay element in the dom inspector
[11:25:55] <decx> good lord andrewanderson those are a lot of js includes :D
[11:26:13] <duch_kazatel> woah
[11:26:29] <andrewanderson> all rails
[11:26:35] <decx> dat dev mode hehe
[11:26:37] <duch_kazatel> 88
[11:26:43] <duch_kazatel> 88 different scripts.
[11:26:57] <andrewanderson> anyway! glad i got attention of some people
[11:27:01] <decx> well it's all separate dev versions
[11:27:05] <andrewanderson> what should i look into if the swipe isn't working in mobile?
[11:27:11] <decx> that'll be minified
[11:27:19] <andrewanderson> i've tried twiddling with preventDefault
[11:27:38] <duch_kazatel> what are you using?  hammer?
[11:27:47] <decx> i never used hammer, but there might be a conflict somewhere
[11:27:50] <andrewanderson> backbone, hammer, backbone.hammer
[11:27:56] <andrewanderson> it only happens on mobile
[11:28:54] <decx> i already forget again where chrome put the emulation
[11:29:01] <decx> damn changes
[11:29:39] <andrewanderson> :s
[11:29:53] <decx> i'm gonna say it's because the viewport is scrollable on mobile
[11:30:02] <suidakra> does anybody know why I can't set a val on an input box in a modal?
[11:30:05] <suidakra> Im using a callback function
[11:30:17] <decx> so instead of registereing the gesture, it just scrolls
[11:30:21] <decx> registering
[11:30:23] <duch_kazatel> make sure you have emulation enabled then click this guy.
[11:30:25] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/y4fh0Xp.png
[11:30:30] <andrewanderson> okay, sorry, let me reiterate my question.. swipe WORKS on mobile, but like 1/10 times
[11:31:42] <duch_kazatel> yeah, if you use emulation mode in chrome you might be able to tell what's up.
[11:31:48] <andrewanderson> how do i do that?
[11:32:00] <andrewanderson> nvm, i'll google

[11:32:07] <decx> i can sort of recreate it in chromes emulation
[11:32:15] <duch_kazatel> go to options, make sure emulation is enabled, then click on this thing: http://i.imgur.com/y4fh0Xp.png, then click the "emulation"t ab
[11:32:17] <duch_kazatel> *tab
[11:32:17] <decx> with small viewport sometimes the gesture works, sometimes it doesnt
[11:33:02] <_genuser_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/8G5G5/
[11:33:07] <_genuser_> shoky: that's teh best I can make it do atm.
[11:44:05] <_genuser_> so I see I need to include jquery-ui.css
[11:44:11] <_genuser_> can one add multiple stylesheets?
[11:46:13] <decx> ask your average wordpress template, the answer? yes.. about 5000000
[11:48:03] <_genuser_> decx: yes, I just realized that was a dumb question. I should just add multiple ones and see what it does, lol.
[11:49:00] <_genuser_> decx: ok, I have the code working just fine on jsfiddle.net. However "pasting" to my file, it fails to hide the div on $("div").dialog({}).
[11:49:04] <_genuser_> any ideas on how to troubleshoot?
[11:49:10] <Laire> I copied the source from the second example from the jquery mobile demo page: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.1/listview-collapsible-item-flat/ but when I copie it in my page it don't looks like the example. same error in jsfiddle: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7uSAP/
[11:49:43] <Laire> How should I work with it, when the example don't work ...
[11:49:56] <decx> which fiddle _genuser_ ?
[11:50:54] <decx> css into head, last one called gets priority for overrides, js in ready function. not much more to look out for i guess
[11:51:16] <_genuser_> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/8G5G5/1/
[11:51:39] <_genuser_> var $loginform = $("#AddRigDIV").logindialog({          <--- that lines doens't hide the div on my server and doesn't make it a dialog.
[11:51:49] <decx> you renamed dialog i see
[11:52:14] <_genuser_> shoky showed me how to create a "custom" template. so I wanted to put it in code so I'll remember it and have an example ready.
[11:53:08] <_genuser_> nevermind that I do'nt know why I named it logindialog, when it should be addrigdialog, lol.
[11:55:36] <decx> when you've opened your dialog check the inspector for the ui-widget-overlay div
[11:57:11] <_genuser_> decx: ok, phew finally got it working. thanks for your help. :)
[11:57:32] <_genuser_> I realized after looking at your code that I wasn't including the jquery-ui.css which means teh overlay and others weren't even getting styled.
[11:57:39] <decx> yep
[11:57:43] <decx> that's what i thought
[11:57:48] <decx> ;)
[11:58:27] <_genuser_> :)
[11:58:38] <decx> finally time to get back to my canvas experiment
[11:58:44] <decx> today: how to make a camera and scrolling level
[12:01:45] <_genuser_> nice
[12:02:35] <suidakra> I can't seem to change the val of an input in a modal window... can anyone help?  I tried setting it in a callback function to no avail
[12:04:09] <decx> i knew i didnt have dejavu
[12:04:19] <decx> you asked that 3 times in the last 4 hours :D
[12:04:36] <decx> cook up an example then people might be able to help you
[12:05:49] <lucenut> I have a text field that I want to mask the characters like it is a password type. I can't figure it out.
[12:06:45] <decx> <input type="password"> lucenut
[12:06:49] <maxmoore14> anyone know of reliable cross-platform keyboard events - specifically one that will work with virtual keyboards?
[12:06:55] <decx> what's wrong with that
[12:06:59] <maxmoore14> I'm using keyup right now
[12:07:07] <suidakra> sorry decx, this is just driving me crazy...
[12:07:15] <maxmoore14> never gets triggered on my android
[12:07:34] <lucenut> decx, without using type="password" :-)
[12:07:56] <decx> you can catch all the inputs and output something else
[12:08:25] <decx> $('input').on('keydown', savenreplacefunction)
[12:08:49] <decx> but type="password" would be cleaner
[12:08:49] <lucenut> I don't understand.
[12:09:09] <lucenut> Is there a way to change the class to password maybe?
[12:09:10] <decx> when a key is pressed, you can catch it before it's put into the input value
[12:10:20] <decx> there's input { -webkit-text-security: circle }
[12:10:29] <decx> if you are into that sort of thing
[12:10:36] <decx> -webkit-prefixes
[12:10:38] <decx> yuk
[12:12:17] <BillCriswell> decx: ick
[12:26:10] <duch_kazatel> guys www.webkinglasvegas.com/
[12:26:22] <duch_kazatel> guys guys guys this is a real thing i'm so excited.
[12:26:54] <decx> the autoplaying loud fanfare was an extra plus

[12:29:08] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[12:29:15] <Laire> I copied the source from the second example from the jquery mobile demo page: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.1/listview-collapsible-item-flat/ but when I copie it in my page it don't looks like the example. same error in jsfiddle: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7uSAP/
[12:30:44] <decx> part of me belives that making a site like that is meta seo to go viral and have people actually call the overpriced hotline
[12:35:14] <decx> Laire the jquerymobile site adds a couple of inline styles, in that case it's .ui-li-static.ui-collapsible { padding: 0; }
[12:39:58] <chars6> hello
[12:41:53] <chars6> could anyone tell me why the click here doesn'y trigger? http://pastebin.com/kCwxVk5J
[12:42:12] <chars6> jquery is imported in a header file
[12:42:45] <decx> you still need to wait for the document to load
[12:42:53] <decx> wrap that shit up
[12:43:05] <chars6> are you talking to me?
[12:43:07] <decx> $(function(){ come inside me })
[12:43:13] <nhulea_nsa> hey so I am having trouble getting to my array I feel like I have a scoping issue I am trying to convert all images that come in through the ajax response to data images and then add them to an array to use later in another function but I can seem to get the array in any good way its the function inside of handledata here is the fiddle if you check the console its coming up empty for me...
[12:43:14] <nhulea_nsa> ...http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/hMLVp/3/
[12:43:14] <duch_kazatel> decx is getting stanky.
[12:43:15] <duch_kazatel> i like it.
[12:43:26] <BillCriswell> Hey yoo
[12:43:29] <decx> tehe
[12:43:50] <BillCriswell> Any of you know what this is from? http://bukk.it/android.gif
[12:44:07] <decx> nightmares?
[12:44:15] <chars6> hah
[12:44:15] <BillCriswell> decx: :(
[12:44:31] <BillCriswell> It's scary, but I want to see more.
[12:45:38] <duch_kazatel> niiiiiiice
[12:45:45] <duch_kazatel> now i'll have that in my head all day.
[12:46:05] <nhulea_nsa> its the imgurcache cache array unless I put the console.log inside of the convertImgToBase64(); function it returns empty ?
[12:46:30] <Laire> It seems like the jquery mobile demo page use other source files, like that one they are listetd in the jQuery CDN hosted files
[12:46:32] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's awesome.
[12:46:51] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[12:47:26] <lucenut> OK, we are using jquery for form validation. We have a custom validation script that enforces password length to minimum 6 chars. I need to have a minimum of 4 on just this one form.
[12:47:52] <lucenut> I cloned the function and made "passwordShort" which allows 4 chars.
[12:48:01] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ lucenut
[12:48:05] <b-ot> lucenut: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:48:33] <BillCriswell> Today marks my full week at the standing desk.
[12:48:34] <lucenut> But when I make the input type="passwordShort" the characters aren't masked.
[12:48:36] <BillCriswell> I am still fat.
[12:48:58] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell but now you have a good reason to sit at home!
[12:49:01] <decx> can'T be good for the knees
[12:49:12] <duch_kazatel> lucenut we can't help you unless you share your code in fiddle.
[12:49:42] <BillCriswell> decx: Everything feels fine to be honest, hands get uncomfortable once in a while, think the desk needs to be a little higher.
[12:49:44] <nhulea_nsa> BillCriswell: what the heck is this http://bukk.it/
[12:49:51] <mfonda> trying to understand the difference between .data('foo', 'bar') and .attr('data-foo', 'bar'). see http://jsfiddle.net/5JD8p/ - i would expect same results for both these examples. i'm confused why the second one doesn't produce the same results as the first
[12:50:08] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: Just a collection of gifs I found posted by Ethan Marcote.
[12:50:27] <decx> data('foo','bar') doesnt change the attribute in the markup but only a hidden property that's bound to this jquery object
[12:50:43] <lucenut> http://jsfiddle.net/bwNLe/
[12:51:21] <lucenut> Is it possible to reference a password type input by id to use a different validation function?
[12:51:26] <decx> mfonda http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xe72j/
[12:51:57] <BillCriswell> lucenut: You should post the code you have.
[12:52:07] <lucenut> http://jsfiddle.net/bwNLe/
[12:52:26] <nhulea_nsa> yo BillCriswell  check this then https://github.com/jglovier/gifs
[12:52:43] <nhulea_nsa> pretty comprehensive
[12:53:22] <lucenut> It might be my strategy that is faulty. That's why I was trying to explain first.
[12:53:23] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: HAha nice.
[12:53:30] <mfonda> decx: thanks!
[12:54:05] <lucenut> I just need different password validation rules in the application.
[12:54:38] <lucenut> They all aren't requiring 6 chars.
[12:54:58] <decx> a timeout in validation? what's going on there?
[12:55:31] <BillCriswell> lucenut: You could do like value.length >= ( element.data('max-length') || 6 ) and use data attributes on the element to override it.
[12:55:49] <decx> good thinking there
[12:55:53] <nhulea_nsa> hey if anyone knows why I can t reach my imgurcache array outside of the function convertImgToBase64 Id really be interested http://jsfiddle.net/hMLVp/4/
[12:56:22] <lucenut> Not sure what you mean there Bill.
[12:57:02] <BillCriswell> lucenut: You could have like <input type="password" data-max-lenght="4" name="password">
[12:57:09] <decx> value.length is bigger than 'this elements data-max-length attribute and if that doesnt exist just compare to 6'
[12:57:20] <decx> smaller*
[12:57:38] <lucenut> Yeah, that's sorta what I was hoping.
[12:57:51] <lucenut> How would I reference that attribute in the script?
[12:58:03] <decx> with the line bill posted
[12:58:07] <BillCriswell> element.data('max-length')
[12:58:21] <BillCriswell> assuming element is a jquery element, if it's not then $(element).data('max-length')
[12:58:21] <lucenut> K, lemme try that.
[12:58:52] <BillCriswell> lucenut: Which validator are you using? I feel like a lot of this could be baked in?
[12:58:59] <decx> most people use http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[12:59:19] <decx> which has a minlength option for every field
[13:00:04] <BillCriswell> I was using max-length like min-length... the details I miss sometimes are astounding.
[13:00:04] <lucenut> The application has this validation rule which I assume is custom. I can't break the rest of the app.
[13:00:14] <BillCriswell> lucenut: Got ya.
[13:00:36] <decx> same thing with a beard BillCriswell
[13:00:45] <BillCriswell> The way I suggested should allow you to change it without breaking anything ( fingers crossed )
[13:00:56] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[13:01:10] <hesco> So I now have a cascading select working with test data, where one selector is revealed by a previous selector, until an ultimate choice is made.  I also have ajax calls working to serve back the html for those selectors.  Next I need to sort out how to extract data from the previous selection to use as an argument for the next ajax call.  can anyone here point the way please?
[13:01:38] <lucenut> So you are saying to replace this line? var result = this.optional(element) || value.length >= 6;
[13:02:02] <lucenut> What happens to password fields without that attribute?
[13:02:16] <BillCriswell> lucenut: I accounted for that in the code I gave you earlier.
[13:02:27] <BillCriswell> value.length >= ( element.data('max-length') || 6 )
[13:02:35] <BillCriswell> Would use max-length if it was defined, or 6
[13:02:51] <lucenut> OK, so replace that line with: var result = ( element.data('max-length') || 6 )
[13:02:59] <BillCriswell> Probably want element.data('min-length') since you're not an idiot.
[13:03:05] <BillCriswell> lucenut: No.
[13:03:10] <lucenut> And put a max-length="4" in the formfield?
[13:03:39] <BillCriswell> lucenut: http://jsfiddle.net/bwNLe/1/
[13:03:46] <lucenut> I'm sorry. I AM an idiot. :-(
[13:04:22] <BillCriswell> lucenut: Nope. Just think you're trying to move too quick haha
[13:04:34] <decx> it's not a jq object btw
[13:04:42] <decx> 2 lines under is element.value
[13:05:06] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah thanks, so: http://jsfiddle.net/bwNLe/2/ would be what you want lucenut.
[13:05:30] <BillCriswell> No sorry, this: http://jsfiddle.net/bwNLe/3/
[13:05:32] <BillCriswell> forgot a )
[13:09:30] <lucenut> OK, I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/bwNLe/4/
[13:09:45] <lucenut> I entered a 2 character pw and the validation didn't fire.
[13:10:20] <lucenut> Dammit. The minLength isn't there.
[13:10:35] <duch_kazatel> you do have some kind of server-side validation, right?
[13:10:54] <lucenut> Yes
[13:10:58] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[13:11:37] <Hyperking> How do I grab all list elements with a class that contains _on?
[13:12:28] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking do you have control over the html getting pushed out/
[13:12:30] <duch_kazatel> *?
[13:13:00] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: no
[13:13:12] <decx> $('[class*="_on"]')
[13:13:16] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[13:14:24] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: Uncaught SyntaxError: <unknown message reserved_word>
[13:15:30] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: here is my line of code http://hastebin.com/laqiqumasa.m
[13:15:46] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it please.
[13:15:57] <decx> missed quotes
[13:17:00] <unnu> question: if i am posting to a page that i wanna add an item to my cart via ajax, is there a way to NOT post again until i have received the .success or .done ?
[13:17:43] <duch_kazatel> by having a global var you test against to see if it's time to.
[13:17:48] <lucenut> OK Bill, that works for validation, but I don't get the custom message.
[13:17:51] <duch_kazatel> or prevent user input until things are done.
[13:17:59] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: thanks, i got it working. needed double quotes
[13:18:04] <lucenut> I just get "Please enter at least 4 characters."
[13:18:17] <lucenut> That's getting closer though.
[13:18:43] <libertyfire> Hi all, noobie question, is this a good place to ask Kendo-UI related questions or is that better handled by their forums?
[13:18:45] <decx> Hyperking put it in a context for added performance like this $('[class*="_on"]','#mylist')
[13:19:39] <Hyperking> decx:umm..using single quotes improves performance?
[13:19:45] <duch_kazatel> libertyfire you can ask here, but we might not know the answer.
[13:19:52] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking look at the second arg there.
[13:20:09] <decx> Hyperking no, but by the second argument adds a context for the selector
[13:20:11] <libertyfire> duch_kazatel thanks
[13:20:33] <Hyperking> decx: thanks. will do
[13:20:33] <decx> it checks all elements with a class for _on, but in a context you restrict that
[13:20:34] <_genuser_> hey guys.
[13:20:34] <_genuser_> so at the bottom of your html doc, you'll add all the dialogs, $('.class').effects(), etc.
[13:21:21] <lucenut> Thanks Bill!
[13:21:22] <_genuser_> add dialogs.
[13:21:22] <_genuser_> do you do all that in one Looooooooooooooooooong script tag?
[13:21:22] <_genuser_> or do you end up creating separate functions.... addForm1(), addForm2(), etc.
[13:21:22] <_genuser_> and each adds the code in it's own <Script> tag.
[13:21:37] <BillCriswell> lucenut: No problem!
[13:24:57] <BillCriswell> http://bukk.it/howidogit.gif so true.
[13:29:12] <_genuser_> is it better to link jquery from their own website vs. downloading it and shipping it with the app?
[13:29:34] <_genuser_> I'm thinking if something changes, have a downloaded copy will help.
[13:29:59] <_genuser_> and if the app is deployed in an environment where outside network isn't visible, it might be better to download the copy.
[13:30:08] <BillCriswell> _genuser_: Arguments for both sides for sure.
[13:30:19] <decx> why not both.gif
[13:30:24] <decx> boilerplate to the rescue
[13:30:35] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ depends on the case.
[13:30:38] <BillCriswell> Truf
[13:30:41] <BillCriswell> Truffe*
[13:31:26] <decx> _genuser_ https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html check line 24
[13:31:30] <_genuser_> alrighty, then I guess I'll leave it downloaded as long as it's not recommended against, that's ok.
[13:31:32] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ we host a lot of that stuff on our servers, but depending on what you're doing....
[13:31:57] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ one benefit of doing it off of, say, google's CDN though is the user will all ready have it cached if they visited somewhere else that had it linked.
[13:32:26] <decx> esp noticable on mobile
[13:32:38] <duch_kazatel> VERY noticable on mobile.
[13:32:57] <duch_kazatel> but that shouldn't be a concern if you're not optimizing your loads in other ways.
[13:38:15] <_genuser_> darn lag.
[13:39:56] <duch_kazatel> freenode is having problems today
[13:39:58] <kochis> I have code that points to https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js, but am redirected to http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js, this is causing problem unsecured-content problems. Is there anyway to specify the re-direct url to use 'https', or should I just point directly to the googleapis
[13:40:23] <duch_kazatel> point it to //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js
[13:40:27] <duch_kazatel> (note no https)
[13:40:54] <ankurk____> duch_kazatel: thank God I am not the only one.
[13:40:58] <kochis> / wil use the protocol for the current domain?
[13:41:03] <kochis> "//"
[13:41:07] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[13:41:11] <kochis> cool, thanks
[13:41:26] <BillCriswell> kochis: ///
[13:41:28] <BillCriswell> /
[13:41:29] <BillCriswell> //
[13:42:33] <ankurk____> And It's -23 degree celsius today :(
[13:46:03] <kochis> Will using "//" use the protocol for the current domain, or where the content was loaded from? For instance, lets say I'm on a page using http, and load a script from a source using https. That script then reaches out to "//". What protocol is used for that fetch?
[13:46:24] <duch_kazatel> the page.
[14:00:14] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/u38Rt/
[14:00:36] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe you're using array wrong.
[14:00:38] <Tomashe> i get error , can not set displayName of undefined
[14:00:40] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:00:43] <Tomashe> why ?
[14:00:51] <Tomashe> i created an array and then set values
[14:00:53] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to use a constructor.
[14:01:02] <Tomashe> which means?
[14:01:03] <duch_kazatel> but using it wrong.  use a literal instead: var array = [];
[14:01:07] <NoiseEee> where's contacts coming from
[14:01:23] <Tomashe> from above
[14:01:29] <duch_kazatel> also - you need to create each index before putting anything in it.
[14:01:36] <Tomashe> ohh i see
[14:01:39] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/u38Rt/3/
[14:01:50] <duch_kazatel> or a string or something.
[14:01:54] <duch_kazatel> be smart about that part.
[14:02:31] <Tomashe> but why Array(), is diffrent from [];
[14:03:05] <duch_kazatel> originally, you were tyring to use new Array(), but that holds on to a useless prototype that you don't care about.
[14:03:13] <Tomashe> and why array[i] = {}; and not array[i] = [];
[14:03:17] <duch_kazatel> you don't need a constructor at all in that case, so use an array literal (the [])
[14:03:29] <duch_kazatel> because in that second case you're trying to make an object, not an array.
[14:03:48] <Tomashe> no im trying to make an array
[14:04:06] <Tomashe> [i]['displayName']
[14:04:15] <Tomashe> thats an array as much as i know
[14:04:28] <Tomashe> object would be [i].displayName
[14:04:28] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:04:29] <Tomashe> no?
[14:04:41] <duch_kazatel> square brackes are for accessing object properties.
[14:04:52] <duch_kazatel> array index are object properties.
[14:04:54] <Tomashe> ok so how do i cretae displayname as array
[14:05:01] <duch_kazatel> you don't want that in that case.
[14:05:02] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:05:40] <duch_kazatel> array[0]['displayName'] accesses the 'displayName' property at array index 0.
[14:05:57] <duch_kazatel> displayname looks like it's getting set to contacts[i].displayName
[14:06:01] <duch_kazatel> which is likely a string.
[14:06:16] <Tomashe> yes it is
[14:06:33] <duch_kazatel> then you don't want [i]['displayName'] to be an array.
[14:06:36] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense
[14:07:07] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:07:11] <duch_kazatel> arrays are just objects that have special rules about how it handles numbered property names.  those rules mean you're using square brackets most of the time.
[14:07:23] <duch_kazatel> *positive numbered property names.
[14:07:59] <Tomashe> that means
[14:08:10] <Tomashe> i need to change array[i]['displayName'] into array[i].displayName
[14:08:10] <Tomashe> no?
[14:08:19] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:08:22] <shoky> those 2 are exactly the same, Tomashe
[14:08:25] <duch_kazatel> those are exactly the same.
[14:08:29] <Tomashe> i see
[14:08:47] <duch_kazatel> the first is using object property accessor syntax.  it evaluates to the second one.
[14:08:59] <shoky> array is an array. array[i] is an object with properties. displayName is the name of one of those properties
[14:09:18] <Tomashe> ok
[14:09:21] <Tomashe> i get it
[14:09:31] <duch_kazatel> arrays are also objects.
[14:09:39] <Tomashe> hehehe
[14:11:32] <Tomashe> thanks guys
[14:11:35] <duch_kazatel> sure
[14:12:12] <duch_kazatel> the spec for arrays is interesting.  blew my mind tbh
[14:13:45] <mary89> shoky:  can anybody help me out with this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/8deT5/
[14:19:07] <shoky> mary89: var diff = new Date("1970-1-1 " + b) - new Date("1970-1-1 " + a);
[14:19:18] <shoky> mary89:  a and b are jquery objects..
[14:19:21] <_genuser_> ok, I want link tags so I can click on them and launch the window. what's the best approach.
[14:19:32] <duch_kazatel> "link tags"
[14:19:34] <_genuser_> I have <a id="addnew">Add </a>
[14:19:36] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[14:19:57] <_genuser_> then $('#addnew').css('cursor', 'pointer');
[14:20:05] <_genuser_> becaue if you do'nt specify href="" it won't change it to cursor.
[14:20:12] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ _genuser_
[14:20:12] <b-ot> _genuser_: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:20:33] <mary89> shoky: need to change to date objects?
[14:20:43] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: coming up.
[14:21:23] <shoky> mary89: need to change to strings, because you're doing + to another string.. and the result string should be a date string, because you're passing it to a new Date(..) constructor
[14:21:35] <shoky> mary89: other than that, it's up to you
[14:22:23] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/DFteF/
[14:22:37] <mary89> shoky:  ohh but i need them as values for the inputs
[14:22:43] <nhulea_nsa> hey can someone tell me why var dude is coming up undefined ? http://jsfiddle.net/H6B9A/
[14:22:57] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: that way, all the "fake" links can be left without href"" tags and pointer will show up on mouse over.
[14:23:05] <shoky> mary89: no idea what you want to do. you haven't asked any question. i explained why you are getting NaN
[14:23:20] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ you do realize you can include jquery and jqueryui in the fiddle without loding them the way you were, right?
[14:23:45] <duch_kazatel> also, don't set css using javascript like that.  use css.
[14:23:45] <mary89> shoky:  i basically need to calculate difference between b - a
[14:24:15] <shoky> mary89: a and b are jquery objects, b - a  doesn't make any sense
[14:24:16] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: for your second point. I see, just move the thing into a css and leave it out of jquery, correct?
[14:24:23] <duch_kazatel> yes
[14:24:24] <duch_kazatel> always
[14:24:31] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: makes sense. thinking too hard about jquery lol.
[14:24:42] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: about your first point, I don't understand what you said.
[14:25:02] <shoky> mary89: a.val() and b.val() will get you the input's value
[14:25:08] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/P2LUW0e.png
[14:25:14] <shoky> mary89: as a string
[14:25:44] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ you can include up there instead.
[14:26:10] <mary89> shoky:  http://jsfiddle.net/8deT5/1/
[14:26:13] <mary89> like that?
[14:26:39] <Tomashe> contacts[i].phoneNumbers[0].value < this is giving me , can not read property 0 of null
[14:26:43] <Tomashe> i guess the [0] is wrong
[14:26:44] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:27:18] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[14:27:33] <Tomashe> so how can iread the first object
[14:27:35] <nhulea_nsa> any thoughts ? http://jsfiddle.net/H6B9A/ it seems like I could get this val outside of the function ? right
[14:27:35] <Tomashe> or array
[14:27:37] <Tomashe> i dont know
[14:27:41] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: very nice. didn't know that. that saves me lot of time, thanks.
[14:28:02] <shoky> mary89: yes. but you need to re-calculate each time you want it to change, example: http://jsfiddle.net/8deT5/3/
[14:28:44] <mary89> damn
[14:30:03] <mary89> struggling with times
[14:30:58] <nhulea_nsa> http://jsfiddle.net/H6B9A/1/ I can even get the array out ?
[14:31:17] <Tomashe> shoky?
[14:31:34] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe that means contacts[i].phoneNumber isn't right.
[14:31:39] <Tomashe> why ?
[14:31:42] <Tomashe> it is right
[14:31:50] <duch_kazatel> console.log( contacts[i].phoneNumbers )
[14:31:52] <duch_kazatel> does that work?
[14:31:58] <duch_kazatel> because that error says it's not.
[14:32:13] <Tomashe> so what possible could it be
[14:32:30] <shoky> it's null
[14:32:38] <Tomashe> phoneNumbers is an array
[14:32:47] <duch_kazatel> did you do what i just told you to do?
[14:33:00] <mary89> shoky:  that worked except for the seconds
[14:33:13] <shoky> mary89: ok, then fix it ;p
[14:33:15] <Tomashe> yes i did ,
[14:33:21] <Tomashe> its same code as u pasted
[14:33:23] <duch_kazatel> then it's not an array.
[14:33:34] <duch_kazatel> share it in a fiddle.
[14:33:47] <Tomashe> hmmhmm
[14:34:03] <Tomashe> hmmits massive i can not share it like like 10k chars
[14:34:10] <Tomashe> the cotacts object
[14:34:31] <duch_kazatel> is it surrounded with [] or {}
[14:34:51] <Tomashe> im console.log( contacts[i].phoneNumbers ) now to check
[14:35:40] <duch_kazatel> console.log( Array.isArray(contacts[i].phoneNumbers) ) - try that.
[14:37:06] <Tomashe> console.log( contacts[i].phoneNumbers ) < this giving me null sometimes and sometimes [object object]
[14:37:11] <duch_kazatel> wat.
[14:37:18] <duch_kazatel> then you have a bigger problem.
[14:37:42] <Tomashe> why
[14:37:56] <Tomashe> i wil ltry strigfy it
[14:38:28] <duch_kazatel> thgat won't work./
[14:38:36] <Tomashe> it will
[14:38:37] <Tomashe> wait
[14:38:37] <Tomashe> :)
[14:38:41] <duch_kazatel> why is it "null sometimes"
[14:38:46] <duch_kazatel> that shouldn't happen.
[14:39:01] <Tomashe> why? i get the contacts with null inside its ok
[14:39:13] <duch_kazatel> okay, that's different.
[14:39:14] <Tomashe> i just want to get he data when its not null
[14:39:21] <duch_kazatel> ... dude that changes things.
[14:39:26] <duch_kazatel> do a check first.
[14:39:33] <Tomashe> yes :)
[14:39:41] <duch_kazatel> if (myThing != null){/* your logic here*/}
[14:39:59] <Tomashe> ok
[14:40:12] <Tomashe> not im stringfy the object to check whats inside
[14:40:54] <duch_kazatel> don't stringify if you don't need to, yo.
[14:41:46] <Tomashe> yes , i just want to check what braces there are inside
[14:41:48] <Tomashe> and show u
[14:41:50] <Tomashe> the json
[14:42:20] <duch_kazatel> dude just run the check i showed you.
[14:42:38] <Tomashe> and just leave the code as i had it before?
[14:42:43] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[14:43:14] <Tomashe> [{"type":"mobile","value":"12-893892-32","id":"17302","pref":false}]
[14:43:20] <Tomashe> btw that s my stringfy it its helps
[14:43:47] <duch_kazatel> your issue wasn't the object type, it was your weird "sometimes it's null" problem.
[14:43:56] <ngharo> check if phoneNumber object is null before accessing it
[14:44:16] <ngharo> it seems pretty obvious you have some null values in your contacts array
[14:44:49] <Tomashe> yep
[14:44:57] <Tomashe> this is what im doing now
[14:45:02] <Tomashe> hope everything will go smooth
[14:45:06] <duch_kazatel> ngharo he failed to mentioned that was a case that could come up.
[14:45:19] <Tomashe> i did not know it was null
[14:45:24] <Tomashe> when i knew i told you
[14:45:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:45:42] <Tomashe> im doing some tests on my mobile device
[14:45:45] <ngharo> duch_kazatel: the error inferred it
[14:45:47] <mary89> shoky:  this isnt correct right? http://jsfiddle.net/8deT5/4/
[14:45:56] <duch_kazatel> ngharo yeah i know.
[14:50:21] <hpekdemir> hi. I'm looking for a way to change a checkbox into an input field. like: "checkbox: provide email address". if clicked. change the checkbox with text to input field.
[14:50:39] <hpekdemir> if user aborts with ESC the checkbox shall appear again.
[14:50:51] <duch_kazatel> hpekdemir don't do that.  hide the input field until the user checks the checkbox instead.
[14:51:10] <hpekdemir> duch_kazatel: why not do that? it is a nice animation
[14:51:26] <duch_kazatel> i mean, don't actually "change the checkbox"
[14:51:53] <hpekdemir> and I ask why not
[14:52:21] <duch_kazatel> a few reasons.  1) changing out markup like that is unnecessary and adds extra overhead that you can avoid.
[14:52:35] <ISmithers> I can find elements with jQuery by id, but what about buttons which don't have an id, only a type and there can be multiples of the same type?
[14:52:48] <duch_kazatel> 2) what happens when your javascript bombs on the page?
[14:53:07] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers have some HTML to demonstrate?
[14:53:23] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel For ex <button type="button">Update</button>
[14:53:28] <hpekdemir> duch_kazatel: ok. but if javascript bombs. then the hidden field can't appear anyway
[14:53:46] <duch_kazatel> not if you do your logic with JS the right way :)
[14:54:21] <hpekdemir> I would use $.('input[type="checkbox"]').val( is checked true: false) <- pseudo
[14:54:29] <ISmithers> An element like <select id="domain"></select> I can find with $("#domain option[value ='0']").attr("selected", "selected")
[14:54:29] <hpekdemir> on change of checkbox
[14:54:43] <hpekdemir> I mean type=text
[14:54:46] <duch_kazatel> hpekdemir use event bindings instead.
[14:54:48] <duch_kazatel> $()
[14:54:51] <duch_kazatel> err...
[14:54:54] <ISmithers> Ignore the .attr etc part. But anyway, just curious.
[14:55:30] <duch_kazatel> $('input[type="checkbox"]').on('change', function(){ $('input[type="text"]').show() });
[14:55:34] <duch_kazatel> that'd be the basics, hpekdemir
[14:55:52] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers i meant in a fiddle.
[14:55:53] <hpekdemir> ok
[14:56:22] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel A what now?
[14:56:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:56:42] <ISmithers> Oh, that's new for me. One sec.
[14:59:53] <hpekdemir> duch_kazatel: it works. thanks
[15:00:48] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel Basic example http://jsfiddle.net/uj5E2/
[15:01:21] <ISmithers> I found the $(#id) selector, but is there one that can find a specific button, which has no id (or at least none that I know of - can you assign one?)
[15:01:27] <ISmithers> Ta in advance
[15:01:43] <ngharo> assign one: id="foobar" on your button element
[15:02:36] <duch_kazatel> you can giuve it an ID if you want..
[15:03:08] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/uj5E2/1/
[15:03:09] <duch_kazatel> or that.
[15:03:30] <ISmithers> Isn't that all buttons though?
[15:04:00] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers sure.  give a better example.
[15:05:14] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/uj5E2/2/
[15:05:39] <ISmithers> I know this is likely a really simple question, but I'm new so be nice :)
[15:06:04] <duch_kazatel> so there are a few ways.  but first - are you in control of the HTML?
[15:06:11] <ISmithers> How do you give it an id btw?
[15:06:14] <ISmithers> The button that is.
[15:06:15] <ISmithers> Yes I am.
[15:06:23] <duch_kazatel> id="yourId"
[15:06:28] <ISmithers> ...
[15:06:36] <ngharo> ISmithers: http://jsfiddle.net/uj5E2/3/
[15:07:00] <ISmithers> Well crap. Didn't know that was a thing, ok thanks :)
[15:07:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/uj5E2/4/
[15:07:28] <ISmithers> Out of interest does the order matter, must it be type then id?
[15:07:34] <duch_kazatel> nope.,
[15:07:39] <duch_kazatel> totally unimportant.
[15:07:45] <ISmithers> OK cool thanks.
[15:07:51] <ISmithers> Appreciate the infos :)
[15:07:59] <duch_kazatel> sure
[15:08:24] <decx> i put href at the end of anchors /firstworldanarchist
[15:08:35] <ngharo> rebel
[15:09:17] <duch_kazatel> nasty
[15:09:34] <cprodigy29> Is this the right place for jQuery Mobile?
[15:09:44] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[15:09:49] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ cprodigy29
[15:09:49] <b-ot> cprodigy29: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:09:57] <duch_kazatel> >:D
[15:09:58] <obert> cprodigy29: no it is the left place
[15:10:14] <cprodigy29> obert: perfect just the place I was looking for :)
[15:11:08] <cprodigy29> How would I go about keeping the same footer across multiple single pages?
[15:11:31] <duch_kazatel> by putting it accross all pages.
[15:11:37] <obert> cprodigy29: server side?
[15:11:44] <cprodigy29> client side
[15:11:55] <duch_kazatel> is each page getting loaded via ajax?
[15:12:07] <cprodigy29> no
[15:12:11] <duch_kazatel> then you can't.
[15:12:14] <duch_kazatel> has to be server side.
[15:12:32] <duch_kazatel> the browser doesn't maintain "State" for you.
[15:13:23] <cprodigy29> ok so just so I'm on the right track.. every page should have have html, head, body, etc.
[15:13:37] <duch_kazatel> doctype, html, head, body.
[15:13:44] <cprodigy29> right
[15:13:46] <duch_kazatel> if you're not using ajax.
[15:13:51] <obert> cprodigy29: find a templating system and use it. why ask it on #jquery?
[15:13:54] <duch_kazatel> just don't load a full page into another page.
[15:14:05] <decx> i saw $('#footer').load('footer.html') once and nearly died
[15:14:06] <ngharo> jquery mobile "pages" consist of <div data-role="page"></div>
[15:14:16] <ngharo> cprodigy29: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[15:14:36] <cprodigy29> ngharo: i got that part down
[15:15:25] <ngharo> make a template of <div data-role="footer"> section and include it in every page div
[15:15:59] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[15:17:07] <decx> data-role?
[15:17:13] <decx> oh thats a jqm thing
[15:18:45] <ISmithers> How do I read +$() as? Is that assign? I can't google it because google thinks I am just forcing results with a $ in them. :|
[15:18:59] <duch_kazatel> have an example?
[15:19:31] <ISmithers> http://jsfiddle.net/uj5E2/5/
[15:20:42] <ISmithers> I am thinking it's just += written in a weird way :)
[15:21:17] <duch_kazatel> something like that.  $("#domain option:selected").val(); evaluates to a string.
[15:21:22] <duch_kazatel> so it's some kind of concat thing.
[15:21:38] <ngharo> looks like a typo :)
[15:21:45] <duch_kazatel> yeah it does.
[15:23:52] <ISmithers> You can see it used in context here http://openntf.org/XSnippets.nsf/snippet.xsp?id=javascript-google-chart-api-csv&SessionID=DLKSS8CR00
[15:24:23] <ISmithers> It should be forbidden to make your library accessible via a symbol... seriously googling information is nigh impossible.
[15:24:37] <duch_kazatel> you mean like jquery?
[15:24:43] <ISmithers> Precisely
[15:24:49] <duch_kazatel> use the word jquery instead.
[15:25:13] <ISmithers> Oh you can do that? So +$() is +jquery()?
[15:25:23] <duch_kazatel> *jQuery()
[15:25:35] <duch_kazatel> (capitalize the Q)
[15:25:38] <ISmithers> Ah OK cool.
[15:25:46] <duch_kazatel> if using that in code at least.
[15:25:50] <ISmithers> Is that usual, or do most people roll with the $?
[15:25:56] <duch_kazatel> most use $
[15:26:03] <ISmithers> Ah OK
[15:26:08] <duch_kazatel> unless you're in noconflict mode, which you shouldn't need.
[15:26:12] <duch_kazatel> also the api docs are grat.
[15:26:14] <duch_kazatel> *great
[15:26:53] <duch_kazatel> and the + is to coerce it t a number instead of a string.
[15:27:09] <duch_kazatel> $("#domain option:selected").val(); probably holds a number,.
[15:27:12] <ISmithers> Ah OK, how did you find that?
[15:27:19] <duch_kazatel> just remembered.
[15:27:24] <ISmithers> I tried searching on the API
[15:27:25] <duch_kazatel> it's a javascript trick.
[15:27:29] <ISmithers> Oh righto.
[15:27:29] <duch_kazatel> not a jquery thving.
[15:27:31] <duch_kazatel> *thing
[15:27:38] <ISmithers> No wonder, cool :)
[15:35:30] <nhulea_nsa> please if someone has a sec can they tell me why dude is always coming up undefined ? http://jsfiddle.net/H6B9A/2/

[15:37:17] <rogue780> hi. I'm trying to support IE8 using the blue imp jquery upload plugin. I have a problem with errors involving the file size being too large
[15:37:44] <rogue780> IE8 won't tell me the file size, so I can't stop it there, and for some reason sending an error code from the server isn't triggering the fail() function
[15:39:12] <rogue780> anyone experienced this issue?
[15:47:30] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel: is there a way to do that ?
[15:47:47] <duch_kazatel> by giving it a return?
[15:48:25] <nhulea_nsa> http://jsfiddle.net/H6B9A/3/ like this it still comes up undefined?

[16:22:06] <zim> Hi all. If I  var data = $(this).data();  then .ajax({ type: var data = $(this).data();"GET", data: data, <- How to NOT escape this and turn it into a nice get string. Many Thanks
[16:22:13] <vinex08> thanks!!
[16:29:51] <guzzlefry> Is there a one-liner to check that all matched input elements are not empty?
[16:30:35] <guzzlefry> Otherwise I think I'll go with .each()
[16:34:55] <jphase> guzzlefry: you can use the :empty pseudo selector for that
[16:35:12] <jphase> $('div:not(:empty)') for example, or something similar
[16:35:15] <guzzlefry> I thought that checked for child elements?
[16:35:19] <guzzlefry> rather than text content.
[16:35:19] <_genuser_> question: adding new data. is it worth is to do an ajax post so it adds and returns a result that is displayed? Or is it better to just go with plain post and returns the entire views.
[16:35:25] <jphase> oh yeah, nvm
[16:35:45] <zim> Any chance someone could have a look at my Q. I am sure there must be a simple solution(tm). Famous last words :-)
[16:36:02] <jphase> guzzlefry: it will check for child nodes as well as text nodes
[16:36:24] <jphase> so if you use that selector with the child-most element, it will work, but otherwise it won't return objects on parent elements
[16:36:39] <zim> guzzlefry, what about looking foe empty elements then if null ....
[16:36:57] <zim> s/foe/for
[16:37:45] <jphase> zim: I don't understand your question, it looks like you accidentally pasted the something where the type value is.
[16:38:37] <zim> Ok. var data = $(this).data(); so data now contains all data-* for this
[16:39:04] <zim> now I would like to translate that info a get string
[16:39:36] <jphase> sure, sec
[16:41:57] <jphase> zim: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/MRtdm/
[16:42:53] <zim> jphase, Many thanks that should do the trick
[16:43:00] <jphase> sure thing
[16:44:37] <zim> jphase, still busting / http://192.168.0.70:8000/admin/refunds?sale_id=11&url=%2Fadmin%2Frefunds
[16:45:02] <duch_kazatel> zim you do realize none of us can access that url, right?
[16:45:29] <jphase> zim: you should paste the contents of your console.log(data); or something
[16:45:33] <zim> yes the point is look at the get string
[16:45:46] <jphase> looks like something is being converted funny there
[16:45:52] <zim> yup
[16:46:08] <jphase> do you have / in your data objects?
[16:46:19] <jphase> %2F = /
[16:46:33] <jphase> oh actually, that should be fine
[16:46:42] <jphase> that will translate just fine to / on the server side
[16:47:00] <jphase> what seems to be the issue zim?
[16:47:30] <zim> OK. Cool code here if it could be better. http://jsfiddle.net/MRtdm/1/
[16:49:22] <zim> Here is a Q. how would I strip data.url from data after I have var url = ...
[16:49:25] <jphase> zim: you don't want param data for your data in .ajax
[16:49:28] <jphase> you want an object
[16:49:55] <zim> jphase, so just data then
[16:49:59] <jphase> in fact, just pass the param data on the end of the url
[16:50:14] <jphase> for get methods, the url is how you pass the params normally
[16:50:24] <zim> ok ty
[16:51:19] <zim> How would i remove url from .data after I have use it as its not required in the get string
[16:52:10] <jphase> zim: "delete" in javascript will remove a property from an object
[16:52:24] <jphase> delete data.url;
[16:52:30] <zim> ty
[16:54:56] <ISmithers> Does anyone know of a site/tool that can generate random csv files for you based on some input data/ranges
[16:56:26] <ISmithers> Yes there is! csvgenerator.com
[16:56:56] <zim> jphase, so like this? http://jsfiddle.net/MRtdm/2/
[16:57:40] <jphase> zim: looks about right, although I'm curious why you're not using $.getJSON
[16:58:29] <zim> Ah yes because it has a little more to go as It may have to post or get
[16:58:37] <jphase> oic
[16:58:46] <jphase> that looks right then, sure
[16:59:02] <zim> Its pointing a a RESTful controller
[17:02:04] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can anyone tell me how do i trim this var cat = '/mycashflow/myexpenses/cable/satelliteservices';  so ill have var first = '/mycashflow/myexpenses'   var second = '/cable/satelliteservices' which is everything else
[17:03:53] <jphase> sheilablackrose: use .split to break it into an array and iterate through them
[17:03:57] <ISmithers> I take it back, the utility is useless, don't use it. Omg.
[17:04:28] <sheilablackrose> wouldnt i have to use join again since for the second part?
[17:04:44] <jphase> ISmithers: are you looking for some sort of CSV API of sorts? It's really easy to just make something that suits your needs in a server side language for that
[17:04:47] <sheilablackrose> is there a better way of sdoing it cuz the second part could be long and hav emultiple /
[17:04:58] <jphase> sheilablackrose: yes, or build out a string as you iterate
[17:05:06] <guzzlefry> Can you break out of each() if a certain condition is met?
[17:05:10] <sheilablackrose> could u send me some link on that?
[17:05:29] <shoky> guzzlefry: return false
[17:05:50] <guzzlefry> Does that stop the next element from running the callback?
[17:05:58] <jphase> yes
[17:06:19] <jphase> returning true skips to next, false breaks out
[17:06:19] <ISmithers> This one is 1000x better http://www.mockaroo.com/
[17:06:28] <guzzlefry> cool, thanks
[17:17:08] <guzzlefry> http://bpaste.net/show/MFfwFvSGEPhH3cd4Xt3r/ Is that going to actually set the 'empty' variable in the .each() callback so I can check it in the lower if statement?
[17:17:18] <TrentonDAdams> Are the blur and focusout events in jQuery known to have problems?
[17:17:32] <guzzlefry> TrentonDAdams: What's the context?
[17:17:42] <TrentonDAdams> The blur never works, and the focusout works inconsistently.
[17:17:52] <TrentonDAdams> Oh, I have a textarea, with it bound.
[17:18:10] <guzzlefry> Pretty sure that should work fine...
[17:18:23] <TrentonDAdams> I've tried blur(), unbind('blur.myname').bind('blur.myname', function blah);
[17:18:34] <TrentonDAdams> I've tried focusout(function () blah)
[17:18:47] <TrentonDAdams> I've tried focusout(function (event) {blah}) rather
[17:19:06] <guzzlefry> Can you make a jsfiddle?
[17:19:21] <TrentonDAdams> I can enter the textarea field, and leave it in a variety of ways, and it only sometimes files. Sure, give me a second.
[17:22:36] <TrentonDAdams> guzzlefry: Now it's apparently not working at all. http://jsfiddle.net/hdZ2a/
[17:24:55] <guzzlefry> TrentonDAdams: typo in the selector
[17:24:59] <guzzlefry> comment instead of comments I think
[17:25:01] <TrentonDAdams> just saw that, duh
[17:25:25] <TrentonDAdams> Now to find why it wouldn't work in my page.
[17:26:47] <TrentonDAdams> Why would textBox.val() be undefined?
[17:27:00] <guzzlefry> oh, you typoed that as well.
[17:27:22] <TrentonDAdams> how?  I thought it was the val function?
[17:27:35] <guzzlefry> var textBox = jQuery("#comments-3923");
[17:27:50] <guzzlefry> You can do textBox = $(this); when you're in a callback like that.
[17:27:57] <TrentonDAdams> oh, frick, lol
[17:28:05] <TrentonDAdams> I should go home apparently.
[17:29:30] <guzzlefry> heh yeah, don't push yourself too hard.
[17:30:13] <duch_kazatel> drink, then code.
[17:30:16] <duch_kazatel> in that order.
[17:31:06] <TrentonDAdams> guzzlefry: Thanks for the help.  It was really just a case of bad naming.  I had a div named "comment-#####", which is hidden by default, containing the textarea.  Then the textarea has an id of "#comments-#####".  And I'm expecting to not be confused???
[17:31:27] <TrentonDAdams> The div is now "commentdiv-#####"
[17:32:54] <guzzlefry> no problem
[17:33:43] <guzzlefry> Does anyone know of a way to return data from an each() callback?
[17:34:08] <sheilablackrose> if i do $(mytable).refresh()   how do i know when it has completed refreshing
[17:34:09] <guzzlefry> I basically need to loop over a set of elements and return false if any element has an empty value.
[17:35:19] <duch_kazatel> don't use each if you can.
[17:35:24] <duch_kazatel> do a normal for loop.
[17:35:39] <guzzlefry> for ($elements) will work?
[17:36:03] <duch_kazatel> yep.  it's an array-like object.  just have to wrap the inext in the jquery function again.
[17:36:27] <guzzlefry> sweet, thanks
[17:36:31] <Milos|Work> console.log($(this).closest('input[type="number"]'));
[17:36:34] <Milos|Work> I want to see what element this is
[17:36:42] <Milos|Work> I just get random jquery object stuff in the console log
[17:36:49] <Milos|Work> how do I get the element's HTML? or does that mean it couldn't find it
[17:37:22] <duch_kazatel> try .html()?
[17:37:24] <systemfault> Milos|Work: What is the .length?
[17:37:40] <Milos|Work> .length is zero, so it couldn't find it?
[17:37:45] <duch_kazatel> there yougo.
[17:37:48] <duch_kazatel> *you go
[17:38:19] <systemfault> Milos|Work: Well.. the line doesn't make any sense...
[17:38:31] <Milos|Work> can you elaborate?
[17:38:49] <systemfault> Milos|Work: It means, get the closest input[type="number"] parent element
[17:39:07] <systemfault> And an input[type="number"] cannot have children
[17:39:08] <Milos|Work> why parent? I just want the closest element
[17:39:21] <systemfault> closest means closest parent
[17:39:22] <duch_kazatel> Milos|Work define "closes"
[17:39:24] <Milos|Work> -_-
[17:39:25] <duch_kazatel> *closest
[17:39:33] <duch_kazatel> closest child, sibling, parent?
[17:39:58] <Milos|Work> I've got a checkbox and I'm trying to toggle an input box disabled or not disabled with it, and I have one checkbox per input, so I'm trying to make a generalised solution
[17:40:00] <cprodigy29>  Do I need to include my javascript files on every page?
[17:40:06] <cprodigy29> or just on the index.html?
[17:40:14] <systemfault> cprodigy29: Any page that requires its content.
[17:40:39] <duch_kazatel> Milos|Work can you toss an example up on jsfiddle?
[17:41:01] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 yes, wherever you want to use those, you need to include them.
[17:41:13] <duch_kazatel> like I said earlier, the browser doesn't carry "state" for you like that.
[17:41:37] <cprodigy29> systemfault: I put the a link handlebars.js on index.html and I'm using it on a sample.html and it works.
[17:42:01] <cprodigy29> systemfault: but if I have it only on sample.html where the actual handlebar code is it doesn't work
[17:42:30] <Milos|Work> duch_kazatel, yeah I should, but let me figure this out first - I've done $(this).parent() which gives me random object stuff in the console log, and .length shows 1 this time.
[17:42:34] <Milos|Work> So how do I see which parent was selected?
[17:42:53] <duch_kazatel> did you try .html()?
[17:43:28] <systemfault> cprodigy29: You cannot load JS files by adding templates.
[17:43:46] <systemfault> .load for example will strip any <script> tags.
[17:44:14] <cprodigy29> systemfault: maybe I should just put this on github so someone can look at it
[17:44:31] <cprodigy29> systemfault: this is my first phone gap app
[17:44:33] <Milos|Work> duch_kazatel, getting somewhere.
[17:44:40] <Milos|Work> <label><input type="checkbox" value="" /> My stuff</label>
[17:44:47] <Milos|Work> so the checkbox's parent is <label>
[17:44:53] <Milos|Work> and then that label's parent is a div
[17:45:15] <Milos|Work> but when I run parent().parent() I get something which I shouldn't get
[17:45:19] <Milos|Work> I suppose I should just make a jsfiddle
[17:45:23] <duch_kazatel> aaaaa why do people do that "here let me describe my html"
[17:45:26] <duch_kazatel> yes please do.
[17:45:44] <Milos|Work> here let me just describe my hypertext markup language
[17:45:49] <duch_kazatel> D:
[17:46:38] <guzzlefry> hrm weird, it's returning the HTML element...
[17:47:17] <guzzlefry> for (var index in $jqueryElements) {     console.log($jqueryElements[index]);  }
[17:47:31] <duch_kazatel> right.  you want the jquery node, right?
[17:47:50] <duch_kazatel> also: do a hasOwnProperty check in there before that console.log.
[17:48:00] <duch_kazatel> but if you want the jquery object, you want $($jqueryElements[index])
[17:48:12] <systemfault> Eww
[17:48:13] <systemfault> no
[17:48:22] <systemfault> $jQueryElements.eq(index)
[17:48:34] <duch_kazatel> eww.
[17:48:53] <duch_kazatel> actually i think you were the one that showed me eq was as fast as my method.
[17:48:56] <guzzlefry> hasownProperty?
[17:48:56] <duch_kazatel> that works too.
[17:49:30] <duch_kazatel> but if you use .eq() use an array iterator instead.
[17:49:32] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: I don't care about micro optimizations, so it's probably not me.
[17:50:00] <duch_kazatel> i don't care about micro optimizations eiter, but .each() is slow.
[17:50:27] <systemfault> But it creates a new scope.. which is often great :P
[17:50:48] <duch_kazatel> it's almost 100x slower iirc.
[17:51:59] <systemfault> Even if it was 1000x slower, if you're iterating on 1000 elements... I wouldn't be surprised if it would still be faster than a single DOM reflow.
[17:52:19] <systemfault> JS is rarely the issue where performance matters... DOM is.
[17:52:30] <duch_kazatel> until you're working with IE.
[17:52:41] <guzzlefry> hrm
[17:52:43] <duch_kazatel> i've seen the browser hang on selectors there before.
[17:52:50] <guzzlefry> I'm getting a random empty element in my foreach.
[17:52:54] <duch_kazatel> because querySelectorAll() performance was trash.
[17:53:13] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry use an array iterator instead.
[17:53:16] <duch_kazatel> not an object one.
[17:53:36] <guzzlefry> example?
[17:53:58] <duch_kazatel> for (var i = 0, arrayLength = array.length; i < arrayLength; i++){}
[17:54:29] <guzzlefry> ah gotcha, thanks
[18:00:57] <jphase> hmm, any one of you ninjas ever make your own parser for tablesorter by chance?
[18:01:21] <cprodigy29> systemfault: https://github.com/cprodigy29/trevrich
[18:01:39] <jphase> trying to change my 0 or 1 values to a lil' check icon and add a parser to sort accordingly.
[18:01:46] <cprodigy29> systemfault: that sample.html is what I was talking about
[18:21:30] <rogue780> anyone here know the blue imp jquery file upload plugin well?
[18:21:48] <rogue780> I'm having trouble getting proper response codes while using iframe transport
[18:23:35] <ProducerSeal> o/
[18:24:26] <ragas> $.ajax({  url: "a-valid-url",  context: document.body  }).done(function() { $( this ).addClass( "done" );  }); is an example from rtfm.  i can see the data i want returned in the object using Console, but dont know how to access it.  its in responseText.
[18:26:28] <_genuser_> ._on() or .click() ?
[18:27:58] <jphase> _genuser_: .click(function(){  is just an alias for  .on('click', function(){
[18:29:40] <jphase> ragas: sounds like you need to pass the return data in your function - .done(function(data){ console.log(data); })
[18:31:25] <ragas> jphase: i put a var obj = $.ajax.... ; and now have access to it: console.log(obj.responseText);  though parsing what came back, looks ugly..
[18:32:21] <jcutrell> Perhaps I am missing something, but I'm experiencing a very strange error on this Codepen I'm working with.
[18:32:22] <jcutrell> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KoEAf
[18:32:50] <jcutrell> Exploring the canvas circles from Apple's 30 year anniversary mini-site.
[18:33:00] <jphase> ragas: do you need the entire jqxhr object? If you don't then don't do var something = $.ajax - just use the method I mentioned above
[18:33:36] <jcutrell> In line 43, I am logging the defaults. However, if I remove line 46 (which extends the defaults object), line 43 logs something different.
[18:33:57] <ragas> ok, jphase, i'll give it a whirl.
[18:34:03] <sheilablackrose> if i do $(mytable).refresh()   how do i know when it has completed refreshing
[18:34:26] <jcutrell> quite bizarre - I thought those lines were synchronous.
[18:35:09] <_genuser_> jphase: :) thx. looked up documentation and went with .on("click", function(){ blah blah });
[18:37:02] <jphase> sheilablackrose: I'm not familiar with .refresh as it's not native jQuery, sounds like you need to look into callback events from whatever plugin/script is providing you with a .refresh method
[18:39:37] <ragas> thats better, jphase, but i still have a nested object heirarchy to parse from
[18:40:27] <jphase> ragas: sounds like you either need to simplify the hierarchy in the response from the server, or parse through it :)
[18:40:38] <jphase> well, either way you parse through it really
[18:43:29] <chandramohan> HI..I need  a help regarding Jquery UI dialog buttons click event capture.
[18:43:57] <jphase> chandramohan: go ahead and ask and someone will help if they can
[18:44:11] <_genuser_> jquery, dialog, on button click where should the data verification happen?
[18:44:13] <chandramohan> i cant able to capture a click event of 'ok','cancel' button
[18:44:53] <_genuser_> when I add the html <input type=submit id=btn> below that $("btn").on("click", function(){ validate; } );
[18:44:57] <_genuser_> ?
[18:45:00] <jphase> chandramohan: do you mean jquery ui dialog or some jquery ui buttons you made?
[18:45:04] <chandramohan> my purpose is capturing events which happened in elements..in page
[18:45:11] <_genuser_> or should I add it at the end of my doc along with all effects/anmations.
[18:45:34] <jphase> _genuser_: it's always best practice to stick your js before your </body> tag imo
[18:45:47] <chandramohan> so i can able to capture all sort events in page.using on() function
[18:45:58] <_genuser_> jphase: that's what I've been reading. However wouldn't it get a little lost from the dialog?
[18:46:18] <chandramohan> but for juqery UI dialog buttons its not capturing.
[18:46:25] <jphase> _genuser_: nah, just make sure your markup uses ids and classes correctly
[18:46:29] <ragas> ok, i globally scoped a var D={} , then in the ajax function assigned D = data that is returned.  so i can access it like so: console.log(D.results[0].text);  jphase.  thnks!
[18:46:36] <_genuser_> jphase: so before </body> I'd be adding all validation JS, however I'd be constantly checking the other section of code where I rendered <div>
[18:46:50] <chandramohan> jquery UI dialog buttons are <button></button>
[18:46:52] <_genuser_> especially if I change ID's, etc.
[18:47:42] <jphase> chandramohan: you can still bind a click event to those like normal - $('button#myUIbutton').click(function(){  or .on('click', function(){
[18:48:12] <jphase> _genuser_: not sure if I understand the question, perhaps if I saw your markup it'd shed some light
[18:48:35] <chandramohan> i tried those ways..but still not capturing
[18:48:54] <_genuser_> jphase: I have a "buuuuuuunch" of dialogs, that I'll add. So I thought towards the body end, I'll always forget what ID's exist in teh dialogs. lol.
[18:49:06] <jphase> but there's literally no reason I can think of to put js anywhere but right before </body
[18:49:21] <jphase> oic
[18:49:43] <chandramohan> dialog buttons does not contains ids because its created by Jquery..so no id..
[18:50:11] <jphase> _genuser_: sometimes I use a class for things like that and use data attributes to popup different dialogs or whatever different things you need to do
[18:51:11] <jphase> chandramohan: not sure why you'd need an id. what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[18:51:14] <_genuser_> jphase: class, you say.... so a class that renders (write the html) for a dialog, and add the JS needed to complete it's UI behavior?
[18:52:03] <chandramohan> sorry i wrongly answered and confused with previous chat..
[18:52:34] <chandramohan> no need of ids, need to capture events..thats mine doubt
[18:52:47] <jphase> _genuser_: more like an element that's similar to... <div class="mydialog" data-size="12" data-foo="bar"></div> and then you can do something like $('.mydialog').each(function(){ $(this).dialog({ // do some stuff with $(this).data here }); });
[18:53:13] <_genuser_> jphase: toooooo complciated.
[18:53:18] <jphase> _genuser_: then you can have a ton of dialog elements that have data attributes and based on those attributes, you can make the dialog do different things
[18:53:26] <jphase> hehe, okay
[18:53:30] <_genuser_> jphase: n00b jquery user here. I'm going to need a few minutes to parse and understand that one. :)
[18:53:56] <jphase> _genuser_: it's not too tricky once you see it, I could show you a fiddle or something if you need
[18:54:08] <_genuser_> but I certainly do appreciate your input. that's how I'm learning it much faster than i would have by just googling. :)
[18:54:14] <jphase> you'd need to be comfortable with ternaries though
[18:54:22] <_genuser_> ternaries are fine. I love them.
[18:55:03] <_genuser_> if you have a fiddle ready, I'd really like to mess with it. :)
[18:55:25] <jphase> chandramohan: you can bind events to buttons right after you declare them.... $('button').button().click(function(){ alert('You just clicked button #' + $(this).index()); });
[18:58:33] <jphase> _genuser_: I'll spin something simple up to show you
[18:59:05] <_genuser_> ooh nice.
[18:59:07] <Vaune> Hey everyone.  Quick question.  Is there a way to manually iterate through $.each?  I have a function that takes a few seconds to complete because of network lag, and I'm looking for an elegant way to loop through an array, making sure to wait for the function to complete before proceeding.
[19:00:13] <jphase> Vaune: https://api.jquery.com/promise/

[19:07:22] <ISmithers> Looking over some docs and I saw this line: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js"></script> is there a reason that that file isn't downloaded and included locally with the other web and js files for the site?
[19:08:05] <mdev> what's latest jquery file link to use
[19:09:33] <ISmithers> Does it change often enough for that to be a concern?
[19:09:57] <ISmithers> Couldn't it cause issues when they update it and break behaviour.
[19:12:28] <sheilablackrose> is anyone here good with sting manipulation?
[19:12:46] <sheilablackrose> how do i trim this var cat = '/mycashflow/myexpenses/cable/satelliteservices';  so ill have var first = '/mycashflow/myexpenses'   var second = '/cable/satelliteservices' which is everything else
[19:13:04] <sheilablackrose> if i use split on / ill have to add it again each time right?
[19:13:08] <chandramohan> my purpose of the application is, i need to create a plugin which captures user interactions of the web application. i can able to capture all DOM related events. but when Jquery UI related buttons and controls, i cant able to capture their events. so please provide a suggestion, because may be application can contain no of qjuery's. for myself using these query's with jqnoconflict.
[19:13:13] <sheilablackrose> is there  a better way of doing it
[19:21:23] <axscode> hi guys, anyone can help with my probs, i wanted to show only the location under the states when one of the select field selected a state. http://jsfiddle.net/YKrET/
[19:26:03] <chandramohan> @jphase my purpose of the application is, i need to create a plugin which captures user interactions of the web application. i can able to capture all DOM related events. but when Jquery UI related buttons and controls, i cant able to capture their events. so please provide a suggestion, because may be application can contain no of qjuery's. for myself using these query's with jqnoconflict.
[19:27:24] <jphase> axscode: The way I usually do this is actually create a different <select> element for each state in that case, it ends up working the smoothest
[19:27:35] <jphase> then show/hide/fadeIn/fadeOut accordingly
[19:28:01] <jphase> chandramohan: if you create a jsfiddle that can show the problem I'll do my best to help
[19:28:15] <axscode> jphase, how about if only have this? i wanted to put into an array so i cna play arround but im not sure how to do it to put into dimensional array
[19:28:52] <jphase> axscode: yeah, if you had an object or array or something then that would work too
[19:29:14] <chandramohan> @jphase. ok i ll try my best to show whats happening. give a mins i ll get back with jsfiddle.
[19:29:18] <Getty> someone here used jstree and had the strange effect that no error comes and still nothing was displayed? no error problems are really a pain in the ass ;) lol
[19:29:23] <jphase> axscode: you need to create a multi-dimensional array that has the key of the state (or state ID or something) and the value of an array of location options
[19:30:51] <axscode> jphase, can you help me with my array, i can work out the rest if i got the array -> my attemp http://jsfiddle.net/YKrET/1/

[19:38:57] <ISmithers> Anyone about to provide some insight on this question - Looking over some docs and I saw this line: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js"></script> is there a reason that that file isn't downloaded and included locally with the other web and js files for the site?
[19:39:53] <Jattenalle> ISmithers, not really
[19:40:24] <Jattenalle> ISmithers, "some people" block JS on random sites, but always allow jquery.com etc
[19:40:35] <Jattenalle> but there's no "real" reason
[19:40:41] <Jattenalle> (as far as i know anyhow)
[19:47:03] <ISmithers> Jattenalle so I could download that file and include it locally, with the only downside being that I wouldn't be instantly up to date, if they updated the one on their server.
[19:47:21] <ISmithers> Jattenalle with the plus side being if they updated the one on their server, and broke something, I wouldn't likewise be instantly broken either.
[19:47:29] <Jattenalle> you wouldnt be up to date either way, since the filename includes the version
[19:47:49] <Jattenalle> so you'd have to update your site to point to the new version, or just downloadit
[19:47:58] <ISmithers> Oh that's actually a startling obvious point.
[19:48:05] <Jattenalle> :)
[19:48:09] <ISmithers> Hehe
[19:48:14] <sheilablackrose> how do i remove everything after the third '/'
[19:49:09] <Jattenalle> ISmithers, also, 1.10.1 is outdated
[19:49:18] <Jattenalle> 2.1.0 or 1.11.0 :3
[19:49:58] <ISmithers> Yeah I was just starting to wonder that when I was looking over their latest.
[19:50:13] <ISmithers> But no drama, easily updated since I can just link to them - bam! :D
[19:50:18] <Jattenalle> :P
[19:51:16] <ISmithers> Surprisingly (to me anyway) that didn't make everything explode. So awesome.
[19:56:43] <sheilablackrose> anyone alive?
[19:56:50] <ISmithers> I sure am!
[19:57:09] <sheilablackrose> can you help me with some string manipulation?
[19:57:12] <ISmithers> But probably woefully inequipped to assist with something.
[19:57:22] <sheilablackrose> ah no worries :)
[19:57:36] <ISmithers> Heh sorry, I'm at work atm too. So I just flick over from time to time.
[19:57:45] <sheilablackrose> :)
[19:59:24] <bigOmega> i'm alive =D
[20:00:01] <tona> hello guys
[20:00:44] <sheilablackrose> anyone good aat string manipulation
[20:02:13] <tona> could someone help me i am using datepicket but it doesnt work here is my program http://pastebin.com/BrjjJ2JT any advise will be great
[20:06:02] <crocket> How do I detect the change in iframe src?
[20:06:46] <ISmithers> What is the difference between the #.get().done and .always?
[20:06:54] <ISmithers> Is always continual?
[20:09:15] <tona> could someone help me i am using datepicket but it doesnt work here is my program http://pastebin.com/BrjjJ2JT any advise will be great
[20:12:17] <jphase> tona: start by never using language="JavaScript1.2" ever again
[20:12:30] <jphase> also, don't use type="text/javascript" if you're coding anything within this decade
[20:12:57] <jphase> also, your script is outside your </body> tag, which is probably why the entire thing doesn't work
[20:13:32] <abjorn> it's also outside the <html> tag
[20:14:01] <axscode> thank you jphase: you're an awesome mentor :D jphase+++++++
[20:14:13] <jphase> np homie
[20:14:44] <tona> i have changed everything and still doesnt work
[20:14:52] <tona> jphase
[20:15:23] <tona> http://pastebin.com/putCJUfE
[20:15:31] <tona> this is my code modified
[20:15:32] <jphase> tona: start with something that looks like this:  http://hastebin.com/veficateci.xml
[20:16:04] <jphase> then put your datepicker in the body before your script tags
[20:16:08] <jphase> your input that is
[20:16:45] <jphase> if that doesn't work, then you are probably not finding jquery and/or jquery ui (check your console for errors)
[20:17:21] <tona> ok
[20:17:24] <tona> let me check
[20:17:41] <tona> where can i download library like datepicker.js
[20:17:46] <jphase> oh, also, are you sure you're able to use just jquery ui datepicker by itself?
[20:17:53] <jphase> I'd download all of jQuery ui if I were you
[20:18:15] <tona> ok could you tell me the link please
[20:18:20] <jphase> like... click this:   https://jqueryui.com/resources/download/jquery-ui-1.10.4.zip
[20:18:35] <tona> ok thanks let my try with your code
[20:18:51] <jphase> also, jquery ui normally comes with a stylesheet too, so you'll want that in there as well
[20:19:02] * jphase steps away for a quick smoke break
[20:19:09] <bigOmega> @crocket : have an onLoad function on the element
[20:19:22] * bigOmega zzz
[20:19:25] <crocket> bigOmega, That doesn't work
[20:20:17] <bigOmega> this is a hack but you can keep checking if the src attribute of iframe has changed
[20:20:20] <tona> jphase one favor , one example to use one grid with jquery, do you have one
[20:21:20] <crocket> OK it works.
[20:21:35] <crocket> bigOmega, How can I do it without putting onload in HTML?
[20:22:00] <bigOmega> do u use jquery?
[20:22:08] <systemfault> crocket: use jQuery to set the load event before changing its src
[20:22:19] <crocket> systemfault, That doesn't seem to work.
[20:22:21] <crocket> I use jQuery
[20:22:36] <systemfault> myIFrame.on('load', function() {}) ?
[20:22:48] <crocket> OK
[20:22:49] <bigOmega> crocket, have a setInterval that keeps checking the src of the element
[20:22:59] <crocket> I used .addEventListener('on', function blahblah)
[20:23:05] <crocket> bigOmega, I wouldn't do that.
[20:23:30] <systemfault> crocket: Don't use that if you use jQuery.
[20:23:33] <bigOmega> crocket, bad idea, i know =D thats why i said hack
[20:24:09] <bigOmega> ideally, an event listener must work
[20:24:23] <systemfault> crocket: The main reason to use jQuery is because it normalizes the DOM.. so use jQuery to bind the event.
[20:24:34] <crocket> systemfault, $("#content").on("load", function() { ?
[20:24:47] <systemfault> Yeah
[20:25:31] <bigOmega> crocket  if it doesnt work, try native DOM manipulation. $('#content')[0].load = function(){...}
[20:25:47] <crocket> Why doesn't it work?
[20:25:58] <systemfault> crocket: Because you're doing something wrong.
[20:28:34] <systemfault> crocket: http://jsfiddle.net/5C28j/
[20:36:49] <jphase> tona: not sure what you mean by "use one grid"
[20:37:07] <tona> yes
[20:37:20] <tona> ok i will try to explain
[20:38:39] <tona> basically i would to use like grid like excel you know rows and columns where can i add records there are many on internet but unfortunately i havent found a easy code to try firstable undertand and secnd to implement one,
[20:39:32] <tona> for that reason i was asking if you know one code to starrt related with grid jphase
[20:39:45] <jphase> tona: does it need to use CRUD routines? like create/read/update/delete rows in the database?
[20:40:55] <tona> yes you are right
[20:41:05] <jphase> tona: I'd suggest using a library like http://www.jtable.org/
[20:41:47] <jphase> there's also an old one I used to use http://flexigrid.info
[20:41:48] <tona> ok that library could i implement button one rows like edit just row selected ?
[20:41:59] <jphase> yeah
[20:42:14] <jphase> they both have that, jtable is a bit neater though imo
[20:43:11] <tona> ok i really appreciated all the information that you given me thanks it time to bed, good night
[20:43:17] <jphase> ciao
[20:44:57] <Getty> i get insane on this jstree problem i have.... if it would give me some error
[20:47:16] <jphase> Getty: have you confirmed your jstree call is being called by adding a loaded.jstree event that does like, alert('blah'); ?
[20:47:54] <Getty> good idea, you mean the jstree feature of loaded or do you mean some jquery general feature i could use?
[20:48:11] <jphase> jstree has that event, you can bind to that
[20:48:45] <Getty> oh i can just .bind('loaded.jstree' ?
[20:48:49] <jphase> also, if you inspect the element, and you can see something like jstree-container-ul then you know it's loaded as well
[20:48:58] <jphase> well... .on('loaded.jstree', function(){
[20:49:07] <Getty> ah ok, yeah, i am too old ;)
[20:49:21] <Getty> yeah i see that changes are made to the elements so i feel something is done
[20:50:16] <jphase> k, then in that case I'd think there's either one of two things wrong - your data source is empty or you have a bad style conflict
[20:50:27] <Getty> i use html data ;)
[20:50:37] <Getty> i can actually see the ul li and stuff its just plain HTML, no js tree
[20:50:44] <Getty> btw loaded.jstree seems not get to fired
[20:52:07] <Getty> jphase: this is what i have now: http://paste.debian.net/84276/
[20:52:07] <jphase> so you have like...  $('#your_jstree_div').on('loaded.jstree', function(){ alert('test'); });
[20:52:29] <Getty> i see all the jstree-icon jstree-anchor and jstree-node classes being added on the HTML
[20:52:43] <jphase> hmm, looks fine
[20:52:44] <Getty> but no ALARMA!!!!
[20:52:52] <Getty> and no real tree on it
[20:53:02] <Getty> i also tried to remove like anything of other JS beside jquery itself ;)
[20:53:05] <Getty> but that didnt helped
[20:53:16] <jphase> well, next step is to use process of elimination and make a jsfiddle with this
[20:53:18] <Getty> there is a bit difference depending on which other JS i load, but in the end the overall result is the same
[20:53:32] <jphase> let me finish writing this script real quick and I'll try to assist
[20:53:37] * Getty gets headache
[20:53:47] <Getty> yeah i mean, i can break it down, i just dont want to
[20:53:55] <Getty> i would probably try it reverse
[20:53:56] <jphase> hehe not that hard, I'll do it
[20:54:16] <Getty> yeah wait.. i check up.....
[20:55:46] <jphase> yeah it works on jsfiddle
[20:55:53] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/AHX3F/
[20:55:57] <Getty> OOOKKKKK i think its my jquery
[20:55:58] <jphase> well, no event
[20:55:59] <Getty> or my jstree
[20:56:00] <jphase> but it looks good
[20:56:10] <Getty> i broke it now down to this:
[20:56:27] <Getty> http://paste.debian.net/84277/
[20:56:30] <Getty> and it still doesnt work 8-)
[20:57:09] <Getty> i test here with 1.11 jquery and 3.0.0-beta8 jstree, both like the latest
[20:57:21] <jphase> hmm, looks like it works in jsfiddle
[20:57:29] <Getty> you dont have my files ;)
[20:57:32] <jphase> even with that updated jQuery
[20:57:41] <jphase> I know, which confirms even more
[20:57:43] <jphase> some conflict
[20:57:52] <jphase> if this works:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/AHX3F/1/
[20:57:54] <Getty> let me first fresh download both stuff
[20:57:58] <jphase> then something on your site is conflicting
[20:58:04] <Getty> you saw my latest post?
[20:58:11] <Getty> there is nothing in there anymore
[20:58:19] <jphase> that's the jquery from your latest post in jsfiddle ^
[20:58:31] <Getty> whcih jstree is it using?!
[20:58:50] <jphase> the one from the jstree site
[20:58:56] <jphase> I viewed their source and stole it :x
[20:59:03] <jphase> from their demo page
[20:59:05] <Getty> wait wait..........
[20:59:11] <Getty> but it DOESNT include jquery, right?
[20:59:12] <Getty> right
[20:59:15] <jphase> it does
[20:59:19] <Getty> where?
[20:59:23] <jphase> jsfiddle does
[20:59:26] <jphase> at the top, 1.9.1
[20:59:29] <Getty> oh ok
[20:59:41] <jphase> and includes jstree and the jstree css externally from their site
[20:59:52] <Getty> something is very f**ked up here
[21:00:03] <Getty> let me download all new and fresh even tho i KNOW i have the right files as i looked into them
[21:00:25] <jphase> well it's probably not your version of jQuery or jstree
[21:00:39] <jphase> but rather some conflict in there somewhere, you inspected the styles and confirmed there's nothing funny?
[21:00:56] <Getty> this is my last test: http://paste.debian.net/84277/
[21:01:03] <Getty> and this test didnt worked........
[21:01:11] <Getty> what... conflict?!
[21:01:16] <Getty> 8-)
[21:01:50] <jphase> not sure, some other files on the page maybe?
[21:02:01] <chandramohan> @jphase Hi..i ve created jsfiddle. how i can invite u?
[21:02:03] <jphase> css most likely since there's no errors?
[21:02:11] <Getty> jphase: please look at the pastebin
[21:02:15] <jphase> chandramohan: just hit save at the top and paste the link
[21:02:16] <Getty> jphase: there is nothign else included
[21:02:28] <Getty> jphase: it must be something with the JS files or something so stupid small i cant se it LOL
[21:02:57] <jphase> Getty: where's their css?
[21:03:24] <Getty> mh cool question the theme should load it, but yeah network says it doesnt get loaded
[21:03:43] <jphase> well, my jsfiddle looked like crap until I included this: http://static.jstree.com/3.0.0-beta8/assets/dist/themes/default/style.min.css
[21:03:53] <jphase> so not sure if the theme is supposed to load it magically or what
[21:03:55] <jphase> but it didn't for me
[21:03:58] <chandramohan> http://jsfiddle.net/chandramohan/jK4La/
[21:04:21] <crocket> All right!!!
[21:04:30] <crocket> '$("#content").on('load', function (e)' { works
[21:04:36] <Getty> damn, that was it somehow.... but then... the themes loaded is f**ked up
[21:04:52] <chandramohan> requirement is need to capture all kinds of events for the element and should be generic function for all.
[21:05:06] <jphase> Getty: that's probably just a particular theme from their demo, download the entire package for the theme you want and use the stylesheet from that theme
[21:05:24] <Getty> that is actually what i did, i mean in between i tested with plain .jstree() call
[21:05:31] <Getty> but also there no css wsa loaded, that actually explains everything
[21:05:52] <jphase> chandramohan: k, looks like you already have that working
[21:06:28] <chandramohan> here its working..but if bind event is separate file
[21:06:33] <chandramohan> cannot work..i need like that.
[21:07:07] <jphase> chandramohan: well honestly I'd use the .button call in whatever file you want to bind the events in personally, but if you for some reason didn't want to do that, then you can bind to the document instead
[21:07:33] <chandramohan> ok.
[21:08:18] <jphase> so, for example, you can do like $(document).on('click', '.button', function(){ alert('you clicked on this button'); });
[21:08:47] <jphase> then you would probably solve that issue, but it's a lot easier to just bind the event to the button as you create it in my opinion
[21:29:09] <Whirl3d> chandramohan, you don't need to call the .button() method to setup a listener. .dialog() creates the buttons and events for you. Using .button() again on existing buttons is not necessary
[21:34:58] <jphase> ah yeah, with dialog indeed. funny, I initially asked if he was using dialog when he said "jquery ui button"
[21:35:57] <jphase> chandramohan: looking at what you said again, it sounds like you just need one function that tracks all the button events. try literally just calling the same function from within each button you declare
[21:37:53] <Whirl3d> chandramohan, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/jK4La/7/
[21:38:48] <chandramohan> @jphase yes not only buttons..all controls.
[21:39:53] <chandramohan> @Whirl3d i need to get 'propagate','cancel' button event listener.
[21:40:34] <chandramohan> @jphase i tried the codes which u given in my file. still its not capturing.
[21:41:15] <jphase> chandramohan: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/jK4La/9/
[21:41:22] <jphase> bind to .ui-button on the create event
[21:41:39] <jphase> then you can have one function for all your ui buttons on the page after the dialog is created
[21:42:32] <chandramohan> ok.
[21:43:45] <Whirl3d> In your existing fiddle, it creates a dialog with two buttons in it. The event handler, however, doesn't handle the "button test" button
[21:44:57] <Whirl3d> by adding the .button() method to "button test" button, it will work, though.
[21:45:23] <jphase> yeah and I guess you could change .ui-button to just button in that last thing I sent on top of what Whirl3d said ^
[21:45:36] <jphase> if you want to have one big ol' event for all buttons that is
[21:46:50] <Whirl3d> unfortunately, this entire process seems a lot like trying to shove a marshmallow in a parking meter. The advice we are giving is so limited in scope that it neglects the fact that this is all wrong to begin with.
[21:47:04] <jphase> lol, seconded
[21:47:27] <jphase> I might have to steal that marshmallow phrase too
[21:47:33] <jphase> I'll be sure to give attribution :)
[21:47:58] <Whirl3d> no worries. It's actually borrowed from some comedian in reference to e.d. lol
[21:48:11] <chandramohan> Guys, Once again i explain my whole concept.
[21:48:24] <chandramohan> my goal is to capture page interactions in the page.
[21:48:40] <chandramohan> so i need to write a plugin for the any application
[21:48:59] <chandramohan> which should capture the DOM elements events ffrom the page.
[21:48:59] <Whirl3d> a jquery plugin?
[21:49:03] <chandramohan> yes.
[21:49:13] <chandramohan> im using jquery 1.9.1
[21:49:18] <chandramohan> for developement
[21:49:39] <jphase> I guess I'm not sure what this has to do with jQuery ui then
[21:50:08] <chandramohan> if the page has jquery UI elements..
[21:50:27] <chandramohan> inside that elements like those buttons events is not capturing.
[21:50:53] <jphase> well I suppose bind your plugin call to $(window).load() then?
[21:51:08] <chandramohan> but i can able to capture normal page elements events using on() funtion
[21:51:24] <chandramohan> yes. i will call like that.
[21:51:24] <jphase> right that makes sense, because the jQuery ui elements don't exist yet
[21:51:32] <chandramohan> yes.
[21:51:34] <DarkGhost> hello guys,
[21:51:36] <chandramohan> u got it.
[21:51:44] <DarkGhost> how would I animate padding-left: by like 3px only until it reaches 30px?
[21:51:50] <DarkGhost> im also animating height at the asme time
[21:53:00] <chandramohan> @jphase do u have suggestion on these now?
[21:53:41] <jphase> chandramohan: the only thing I could suggest is to extend the jQuery UI object and change the create event if and when jQuery ui is present, which sounds a tad messy
[21:54:28] <crocket> Why can't I capture <a href="/resource/temp-2.epub/Cover.html" target="content" id="toc-Cover.html">Cover</a> with $("#toc-Cover.html")?
[21:54:47] <jphase> crocket:  $("#toc-Cover").html()
[21:54:57] <jphase> oh
[21:54:58] <jphase> nvm
[21:55:02] <jphase> .html is in your id?
[21:55:03] <crocket> jphase, $("#toc-Cover.html") returns a null array.
[21:55:07] <crocket> jphase, yes
[21:55:15] <jphase> erm, why?
[21:55:31] <jphase> I mean, the reason why you can't is cause . = class selector
[21:55:33] <chandramohan> im not much familiar with jquery UI framework  i tried to change but i cant understand. do u help me spot the things and create event
[21:55:36] <crocket> jphase, damn
[21:55:43] <jphase> so you're trying to grab id of toc-Cover and class of html
[21:55:58] <crocket> jphase, How can I change that?
[21:56:24] <jphase> crocket: well, don't have funny ids.... but if you HAVE to have the funny id, use $('[id="toc-Cover.html"]')
[21:57:20] <crocket> jphase, That doesn't work either.
[21:57:25] <crocket> oops
[21:57:32] <crocket> I didn't remove #
[21:57:37] <crocket> ok it works now
[21:58:14] <marismaro> if I want to be able to update some text within a tag, in a counter-like fashion, do I use ('#<id>').val(<count>)?
[21:58:35] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/fc25e/2/
[21:59:44] <Whirl3d> sorry, chandramohan, replace eventList with the list of events you want to listen for and you are set. You'll have to lookup the event properties to extract whatever data you want.
[22:02:56] <DarkGhost> anyone?
[22:02:56] <Whirl3d> marismaro, what do you mean "update some text within a tag"
[22:03:06] <chandramohan> @whirl3d i am doing like only, but these jquery UI dialog buttons only things i cant able to capture..reason it is created after DOM load.
[22:03:18] <chandramohan> thats y im still hanging with matter.
[22:03:41] <jphase> chandramohan: you need to extend jQuery UI and hook into their create event
[22:04:45] <Whirl3d> or $("document, .ui-button, ui-whatever').on(eventList, function (e)....
[22:05:41] <jphase> yeah I guess binding to the document should work no matter what elements are inserted after the fact and it's much less headache actually
[22:05:57] <Whirl3d> *.ui-whatever, sorry. that will capture standard dom events on all ui elements created after dom has loaded.
[22:06:22] <Whirl3d> yeah. what he said
[22:09:36] <chandramohan> ok. i need one suggestion on this. user clicks one textbox, that time shall i delete all events using off() method and re create again using .on() method. or shall i create all events when page load itself.
[22:10:28] <chandramohan> in that sense, now what i am doing his, when event occured i delete all events and create again and capture the event object.
[22:10:30] <jphase> if you're making a plugin, I'd recommend not pissing off developers by undbinding their events
[22:11:10] <chandramohan> im using jqnoconflict for event bind and event unbind.
[22:11:56] <chandramohan> because i dont want to interfere page events..
[22:12:46] <chandramohan> then how i can bind all these events and captures the event object for further process.
[22:13:22] <jphase> both Whirl3d and I have suggested this a few times by now, bind your event to the document, there's a couple of ways to do it
[22:14:03] <Whirl3d> You might still miss any events that use event.preventDefault() or event.stopPropagation()...I would TIAS
[22:14:14] <jphase> indeed
[22:14:49] <jphase> and if jQuery UI or another library does that, then the only way around it is to extend their library
[22:14:55] <Whirl3d> The event object is passed with the event in jquery, so $('document').on(eventlist, function (e) { .....the event is stored in the variable e
[22:15:56] <chandramohan> ok.
[22:37:50] <chandramohan> @jphase @whirl3d Thanks for your kind suggestions. i look forward to work on those things.. Once again many thanks.. :)
[22:38:15] <Tomashe> hey guys
[22:38:30] <Tomashe> any crossbrowser solution for copytoclipboard?
[22:41:27] <systemfault> flash..
[22:41:39] <systemfault> They all use stupid flash.
[22:46:22] <randomdev> Could anyone tell me how to modify the following so it would work with a link like http://domain.com/page#target instead of just #target ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717527/jquery-smooth-scrolling-when-clicking-an-anchor-link
[22:48:52] <_genuser_> so what's wrong with this?
[22:48:57] <_genuser_> http://pastebin.com/q0YuWjUF
[22:48:59] <jphase> randomdev: you can do that with jQuery
[22:49:14] <_genuser_> trying to add an alert to all the links to capture the caption.
[22:50:49] <randomdev> jphase, I thought the scrolltop in the example was jquery? it works fine for normal #target links.. but if I try domain.com/page#target it doesnt
[22:51:14] <randomdev> i assume because the this, 'href' bit grabs the whole link not just the #target
[22:51:22] <jphase> randomdev: I do this on a site I'm developing - http://sql.bot.nu/
[22:51:37] <jphase> the js involved is in this file: http://sql.bot.nu/wp-content/themes/ct/js/ct.js?ver=3.8.1
[22:51:59] <ragas> $.ajax({  type: "POST" url: "a-good-url",  data: {text:"Take me to your server"},  success: alert("success"),  dataType:"json"   });    anything glaringly malformed about this request?
[22:52:04] <jphase> granted, this is particular to this site, but the concept is the same - split the link at # and grab that corresponding id
[22:52:26] <randomdev> thanks i will take a look
[22:53:37] <jphase> _genuser_: you're missing a ) after .text()
[22:53:59] <jphase> alrighty, it's late, night night coders
[22:54:31] <ragas> nite.  thanks again.
[22:55:26] <randomdev> Have I stuffed something up here? http://pastebin.com/w9ZzLdtP
[22:56:08] <randomdev> i replaced $a.attr(this, 'href') with link
[22:57:15] <_genuser_> thx. :)
[22:59:18] <randomdev> sorry here is the full file http://pastebin.com/hA29ZT23
[23:39:23] <crocket> How do I get a node from an xpath string?
[23:40:24] <Cork> xpath? why do you need xpath?
[23:41:04] <crocket> Corey, My coworker wants to select an HTML node with xpath.
[23:41:08] <crocket> He already has xpath strings.
[23:41:23] <Cork> you would have to use XPathEvaluator
[23:41:27] <Cork> warning though; it is slow
[23:41:30] <crocket> Where is it?
[23:41:37] <Cork> ?mdn XPathEvaluator
[23:41:39] <b-ot> Cork: Introduction to using XPath in JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network â https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction_to_using_XPath_in_JavaScript
[23:41:55] <Cork> heh, not what i intended to link; but what ever...
[23:42:15] <systemfault> eww xpath in html..
[23:42:19] <Cork> ya
[23:42:30] <Cork> i've rewritten code that uses xpath
[23:42:32] <Cork> to use css
[23:42:43] <Cork> and normally it is a nice 5-6 times speed improvments
[23:42:50] <Cork> so i REALLY can't recommend using xpath
[23:43:00] <systemfault> XPath is more powerful... but you don't really need it :P
[23:43:29] <crocket> Cork, IE doesn't support document.evaluator
[23:43:31] <crocket> Cork, IE doesn't support document.evaluate
[23:43:57] <crocket> Cork, How else should I reference a specific node?
[23:44:00] <Cork> sigh so that page was wrong
[23:44:08] <Cork> crocket: css selector
[23:44:14] <crocket> Cork, really?
[23:44:18] <Cork> yes
[23:44:20] <crocket> Cork, My coworker doesn't want to use css selector.
[23:44:27] <systemfault> Can't you tell your coworker that he's a moron?
[23:44:29] <Cork> well it is his/your choice
[23:44:34] <crocket> Damn
[23:44:45] <crocket> How can I use a css selector to select a node?
[23:44:46] <Cork> but you should have a look at the speed difference of those two commands
[23:45:07] <Cork> document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll
[23:45:20] <Cork> though as you are in jquery you use $('selector')
[23:45:32] <crocket> Cork, Can I use a css selector to select a specific HTML node that doesn't have a class or an id?
[23:45:42] <Cork> sure
[23:45:51] <Cork> you need to select it based on related elements
[23:45:53] <crocket> Cork, Tell me how to select the 2nd p.
[23:46:10] <Cork> document.querySelectorAll('p')[2]
[23:46:15] <Cork> opps
[23:46:16] <Cork> document.querySelectorAll('p')[1]
[23:46:32] <crocket> Cork, oh man
[23:46:42] <crocket> Cork, I need to store the location of an HTML element in a file.
[23:46:49] <crocket> That's not going to work.
[23:47:10] <Cork> crocket: you can use nth-child and a lot of other psudo selectors
[23:47:26] <Cork> crocket: but then you need to explain what you have a bit more
[23:47:54] <crocket> Cork, My coworker wants to convert text selections into epub annotations.
[23:47:59] <Cork> cause you can select document.querySelectorAll('p:nth-child(2)')
[23:48:02] <crocket> He wants to save those annotations in a text file.
[23:48:12] <Cork> but it actually does "select p that is the second child"
[23:48:15] <Cork> not the second p
[23:48:15] <crocket> He also wants to recover annotations from files.
[23:48:38] <Cork> crocket: if you use jquery you can make it a string
[23:48:44] <Cork> $('p:eq(2)')
[23:48:47] <crocket> Is there a simple function or library that converts HTML nodes to css selectors and vice versa?
[23:49:18] <Cork> i know dom inspector for firefox can help you build selectors
[23:49:25] <Cork> can't say i've seen it anywhere else
[23:49:45] <Cork> oh right
[23:49:59] <Cork> element hiding helper for adblock (firefox again) has a nice one
[23:50:41] <crocket> Cork, It has to support many browsers.
[23:50:56] <Cork> crocket: the selectors work in all browsers except for a few old ie browsers
[23:51:10] <crocket> Cork, the selectors?
[23:51:11] <Cork> the extensions that provide the helpers is browser specific
[23:51:18] <Cork> crocket: the generated css selector
[23:51:28] <crocket> Cork, The generated?
[23:51:31] <Cork> ...
[23:51:42] <Cork> you just asked to convert dom element to a selector...
[23:52:05] <Cork> a dom element is an object so you need to generate a selector
[23:52:09] <crocket> Cork, document.evaluate doesn't work on IE10.
[23:52:10] <Cork> cause a selector can't be a dom element
[23:52:27] <Cork> uh, so your back on using xpath?
[23:52:49] <crocket> Cork, not sure
[23:52:57] <crocket> Cork, I just want anything that works.
[23:53:13] <Cork> crocket: the google search that resulted in that mdn link wasn't what i wanted to link https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Using_XPath
[23:53:37] <crocket> Cork : You seem to suggest that I install browser plugins to support node selection.
[23:53:56] <Cork> uh...
[23:53:58] <Cork> no
[23:54:24] <Cork> i suggested you installed an extension to help you do the convertion you asked for a tool to help you do
[23:54:51] <crocket> Cork : I don't want to convert nodes to selectors manually.
[23:54:57] <crocket> It has to be done programatically.
[23:55:09] <Cork> google it
[23:55:13] <Cork> you might find a converter
[23:55:22] <Cork> but it isn't a node converter
[23:55:25] <Cork> it isn't possible
[23:55:27] <crocket> ???
[23:55:32] <Cork> but it might be a xpath converter
[23:55:40] <Cork> a node is a document object
[23:55:46] <Cork> it isn't a selector of any kind
[23:56:11] <Cork> its like converting a program to a table
[23:56:26] <Cork> it is two different things not event capable of being in the same place
[23:57:14] <Cork> crocket: btw for ie support you need to use http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754523%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[23:57:19] <Cork> note that only works in ie
[23:57:37] <Cork> so you need to check witch one exist and pick from that
