[00:01:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i hope youll help me with adding sass
[00:01:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> later
[00:01:35] <grafi> sure, no problem
[00:01:37] <grafi> :)
[00:07:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: check the repo
[00:08:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> maybe less of a border but
[00:09:35] <grafi> definately less of a border
[00:10:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[00:10:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> 2 px less i think
[00:10:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> to mathc the weight of font?
[00:11:27] <grafi> sure
[00:11:52] <grafi> im digging the dark buttons, not really really sure about the light ones
[00:12:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> well the light one doesnt have a particular applciation
[00:12:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> its used when ever
[00:12:16] <tables> how can i make a POST or GET query to the server and update a <div> with the result?   i need something simple
[00:12:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats why there is secodary and primary
[00:12:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: check repo
[00:12:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> there
[00:13:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> thicker?
[00:14:10] <grafi> 1px more
[00:14:10] <grafi> :P
[00:14:38] <grafi> tables use $.ajax
[00:14:40] <jnewt> is there something wrong with my jquery here:  i don't seem to be getting POST value 'id' , but it may be a server issue, idk: http://pastebin.com/Q9iZiEKq
[00:15:05] <grafi> jnewt what are you getting?
[00:15:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> alright
[00:16:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think it looks good
[00:16:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol if im not mistaken
[00:16:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> bootstrap does it the opposite way
[00:16:37] <grafi> ^^
[00:16:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh well
[00:16:43] <jnewt> grafi: nothing i think.  if i remove that { id: this.id }, it performs a GET request without issue.
[00:16:54] <grafi> you think?
[00:17:01] <grafi> go look at your development console ^^
[00:17:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: wanna do it he toher way
[00:17:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> or leave it
[00:17:48] <grafi> leave it
[00:18:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol we should have done long shadow
[00:18:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahahha
[00:18:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay colors
[00:18:15] <grafi> waagh^^

[00:18:45] <grafi> ^^
[00:20:36] <jnewt> grafi: do you see an issue with the jquery?
[00:20:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: take a look at this
[00:20:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/
[00:21:01] <grafi> looks okay on a glance jnewt
[00:21:22] <jnewt> grafi, ok, thanks.
[00:21:36] <grafi> pretty cool Rohan_Bhangui
[00:21:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[00:22:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> neways
[00:22:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think we made good progress
[00:22:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> 4 hours spent and we have 2 buttons
[00:22:55] <grafi> :D
[00:23:28] <grafi> at that rate, well be finisched by 2015
[00:24:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> yup
[00:24:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> now a better question is
[00:24:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> for stuff like check boxes
[00:24:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> do we  do something like my ios7 toggle or soemthigna bit more traditional
[00:25:05] <grafi> more traditional i feel
[00:25:13] <grafi> styled is still okay though
[00:25:13] <grafi> :P
[00:35:13] <jop008> window.location.replace ( "./vw-bookperson.htm?objectID=" + objectID ); when I debug this line I see replace function but it is stated as inactive code but why?
[00:37:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> i noiw
[00:37:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont plan to use default
[00:37:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: the default is unpredictable and ugly
[00:38:07] <grafi> is that a feature?
[00:38:08] <grafi> ^^
[00:47:29] <jop008> Can someone explain this window.location.replace
[00:47:29] <jop008> function () { [native code] }
[00:47:38] <jop008> on the console
[00:47:44] <grafi> whats to explain?
[00:48:32] <jop008> when I use the replace function nothing is happening
[00:50:12] <grafi> show code?
[00:51:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: whats a feature?
[00:52:27] <grafi> a newly found bug
[00:52:29] <grafi> :P
[00:52:40] <grafi> like i said, its all about the branding ^^
[00:54:03] <grafi> hm ima be afk for a while, cya
[00:54:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> kkk
[00:54:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> *kk
[00:54:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> i meant
[00:54:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> im not a white supremisist
[01:32:05] <sammych_> who wants to check this fiddle for me. It's exactly how I want it in Chrome. In FF it doesn't overflow properly. In Safari, it fails to resize
[01:32:06] <sammych_> http://jsfiddle.net/BA7VD/
[01:33:02] <sammych_> FF is broken because of the absolute pos inside a table-cell apparently
[01:48:32] <raj> damn, I just realized for the first time, .each() really should be el,i
[01:52:06] <sammych_> that is what it is
[01:57:43] <alxy> hello, i have a problem with google maps integration into jquery mobile ... I just copied the basic example for  modals/dialogs on a google map: http://demo.familie-guth.com/wildlife/demos/jquery-google-maps-mobile-boilerplate.html
[01:58:09] <alxy> however, the modals never show up (they are created, but with display:none obv)
[01:58:34] <alxy> dont know if you also offer help for third party plugins, but i hope so
[02:20:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you back?
[02:39:54] <raj> how much better is an eventlistener on a container of elements (then filtering to the element class within .on()) instead of adding it to the element itself when creating it?
[02:40:23] <sammych_> delegates is the way to go
[02:41:06] <raj> cool, thanks
[03:13:12] <sammych_> can someone fix this for me in Safari?
[03:13:13] <sammych_> http://jsfiddle.net/BA7VD/5/
[04:51:41] <derdsty> Need some help with an ajax request
[04:51:44] <derdsty> can't make it work
[04:51:47] <derdsty> http://jsfiddle.net/Pa6jF/
[04:52:35] <derdsty> Server gets the request and handels it nicely, but the ajax request calls error
[04:52:50] <derdsty> Even before the request is even returned from the server
[04:54:29] <raj> you can do ajax cross domain
[04:54:32] <raj> *can't
[04:54:56] <raj> you have to use the directions in the AJAX REQUESTS on the left side of jsfiddle
[04:56:04] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/Pa6jF/1/
[04:56:23] <derdsty> Cross-domain meaining?
[04:57:05] <raj> http://undefined-ide.jit.su/sendData vs jsfidde.net/Pa6jF
[04:57:38] <raj> those are two different domains
[04:58:11] <derdsty> So, I have to run both scripts on the same host?
[04:58:22] <raj> so your "domain" is "undefined-ide.jit.su"
[04:58:36] <raj> I think so, not an expert there
[04:58:55] <derdsty> Either way it's not working
[04:58:55] <raj> there may be other ways
[04:59:12] <derdsty> I've tried running the script on the same computer
[04:59:15] <derdsty> and on different
[04:59:20] <derdsty> and on hosted servers
[04:59:44] <raj> the exact script in fiddle?
[05:00:04] <derdsty> Pretty much, yes
[05:00:09] <derdsty> I'll give it another shot, 1min
[05:01:02] <derdsty> That one doesn't even reach the server
[05:01:50] <derdsty> Nevermind
[05:01:51] <derdsty> jk
[05:02:07] <derdsty> Though still giving me an error
[05:02:13] <derdsty> [object Object]
[05:02:22] <raj> use console.log() instead of alert()
[05:02:33] <raj> then press F12
[05:02:36] <raj> and load the page that way
[05:02:42] <raj> with the console open
[05:02:57] <raj> ...press F12 in your browser, that is
[05:03:53] <derdsty> Yeah, that's not working. Origin not allowed
[05:04:03] <derdsty> that's why I'm running my server on a different host
[05:04:53] <derdsty> Though'
[05:04:57] <derdsty> that's not working either
[05:05:01] <derdsty> same error xD
[05:05:13] <derdsty> No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
[05:05:16] <derdsty> etc
[05:06:00] <intellix> anyone using Emmet that knows how to repeat rows with 2 TDs inside them? like table>tbody>tr*2>td*2
[05:06:20] <intellix> ah that works :P sure it didn't used to
[05:07:01] <derdsty> raj I'll try and allow some headers
[05:08:42] <derdsty> Okay
[05:08:47] <derdsty> I'm retarded
[05:08:52] <derdsty> Thanks for your help raj
[05:11:49] <raj> derdsty, I always explaining how to have a more meaningful output with console.log() instead of [object Object] with alert()
[05:12:01] <raj> always = was
[05:12:14] <derdsty> Yeah, I noticed ;)
[05:12:18] * raj is sleepy
[05:12:22] <cusco> or console.debug()
[05:12:24] <derdsty> xD
[05:12:47] <derdsty> I'm not used to using jQuery
[05:12:54] <derdsty> or any web-programming for that part
[05:13:15] <derdsty> Except serverside, but there I mostly use C++, etc..
[07:20:05] <Ownage> how can I do something to the 'next' tr?
[07:20:39] <Ownage> specifically I have  jQuery("tr#a").toggle(500); but I just want that to be 'the next tr you find'
[07:20:44] <Rickardo1> in 1.9 the live() method is deprecated.. Is there any way to bind to elements loaded with ajax with on() ?
[07:21:09] <stenno\explodes> Rickardo1: .on does that
[07:21:57] <Rickardo1> stenno\explodes: do I have to run .on() after ajax loaded?
[07:22:33] <stenno\explodes> run? you can bind it whenever you want
[07:23:09] <stenno\explodes> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:24:00] <stenno\explodes> also the documentation for .live mentions using .on instad
[07:24:02] <stenno\explodes> instead
[07:26:24] <Ownage> I tried using .next but it toggles all trs
[07:27:01] <stenno\explodes> Rickardo1: i guess they have to exist first, so bind with .on after html is injected, or use delegates as mentioned
[07:27:26] <Ownage> http://pastebin.com/Cjs2mbVc
[07:35:09] <Ownage> ok looks like the problem is the function is made before the button I click. so my question is, how do I tell a function to run at the position it's triggered from?
[07:36:31] <Ownage> in other words if I make a function which uses next().first(), it looks from where the function is, rather than the something that triggered it
[07:44:57] <megalomix> hello friends
[07:45:07] <megalomix> i have starting with sortable / draggable
[07:45:11] <megalomix> i did it: http://jsfiddle.net/X3Vmc/
[07:45:25] <megalomix> i do not understand why sometime it is not very precise
[07:46:26] <megalomix> when i am over a <li> in sortable it is not very precise, i have to move the mouse to put the draggable element to the list
[07:46:33] <megalomix> please, could you check it?
[07:47:12] <megalomix> try to add the draggable element in sortable...and then add other in sortable simulating the change of the position
[07:47:24] <megalomix> i also put a placeholder to see the position of the element
[07:49:07] <megalomix> someone here?
[07:53:18] <krambiorix> i have a div with some filled in forms in it... when i do var content = $("div.html").clone(); result.html = content.html()   ...content.html() gives me all html but none of the fields are filled in... What can i do?
[07:59:32] <krambiorix> anyone?
[08:00:26] <jop008> how to tavkle this one Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[08:00:31] <jop008> at line 1
[08:00:41] <jop008> how to find the error?
[08:00:48] <_rgn> remove stuff until it works
[08:13:52] <haleys> After digging into twitter typeahead, it's pretty robust. I was trying to do some things manually that were already built in. Having fun with it
[08:15:13] <krambiorix> how can i set a textarea's value like this? $(this).attr('value', $(this).val());   ....?
[08:17:08] <haleys> krambiorix: wouldn't it just be, $('#my-textarea').html('some value here'); ?
[08:17:44] <haleys> or $('#my-textarea').val('some value here');
[08:18:01] <krambiorix> haleys, when i clone the whole div that contains the textarea and get html() on it, i don't get the value ...
[08:18:57] <haleys> krambiorix: Maybe set the value to a var before cloning it, and then adding it back in. Maybe try .html(), or .text(), or .val() to get the value before cloning.
[08:19:37] <krambiorix> haleys, that's what i'm doing now
[08:19:50] <haleys> krambiorix: You may also need to use .on() as you are trying to update an item that was loaded after jquery was loaded
[08:20:02] <krambiorix> ok
[08:20:23] <haleys> krambiorix: Without using .on() jquery may not recognize the newly cloned element
[08:21:09] <haleys> .live() use to be the way to go, but it was depreciated, of which .on() now takes over
[08:21:50] <krambiorix> haleys, hmm, $(this).text($(this).val()); doesn't work
[08:23:00] <krambiorix> haleys, http://pastebin.com/zRVnV5Eg
[08:23:53] <haleys> krambiorix: You would do it directly on the textarea. Right now it looks like you are wrapping it. i.e. it would be either be var textareaValue = $('#my-textarea').html(); or var textareaValue = $('#my-textarea').text(); or var textareaValue = $('#my-textarea').val();
[08:24:16] <haleys> then you should be able to console.log(textareaValue); to see if it worked or not
[08:24:47] <krambiorix> haleys, i get the value
[08:24:56] <krambiorix> but setting it back in the html doesn't seem to work
[08:25:26] <krambiorix> haleys, for input fields, $(this).attr('value', $(this).val());  -> this works
[08:25:35] <krambiorix> but not for textareas
[08:26:44] <haleys> krambiorix: Have you tried $('#my-textarea').val($(this).val());
[08:27:26] <haleys> textarea doesn't have a value attribute, which is why it is working for input's but not textareas.
[08:31:06] <krambiorix> haleys, you're right, $(this).val() doesn't return anything for textarea
[09:13:31] <jnewt> i have a modal form that has is using easyModal .  I have a few requirements that are not being met (although I like the easy of styling with easyModal).  1.  when tabbing, after the last button, i'd like the next tab to focus the 1st form item, not some non-modal element below) 2. i can't drag it (probably need to just get jqueryui draggable) 3.i'd like to stop scrollwheel frrom scrolling the underlying page
[09:14:09] <jnewt> so, should i continue with easyModal, or switch to something else?
[09:36:28] <haleys> Anyone know if it's possible to hide the dropdown/suggestions on AutoComplete/tab for the typeahead library?
[10:01:49] <jisan> hello
[10:02:02] <jisan> can anyone help solving a jquery problem?
[10:02:45] <walidvb> hi guys, i'm writing a little code for a website, and i can't figure out which is best, for a task as simple as opening a div(toggling parents' classes), or more complex tasks.
[10:03:19] <walidvb> should one have the click event on the 'expander_trigger' run a callback function, or trigger an event?
[10:04:25] <walidvb> My question is design related, in the sense that maybe I will need another type of trigger, so I thought it might be that event based is better, but I can't argue either for or against such code principle
[10:07:56] <walidvb> ask?
[10:07:58] <walidvb> ?ask
[10:07:58] <b-ot> walidvb: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[10:46:04] <scar> how can i select the parent form of a button when clicked.. AND THEN find all elements in that form that have required attribute and check each one, etc. i've been trying to use $.each, but when i get a variable 'my_form' created and PROPERLY selected the form using .closet(), i cannot figure out how to use a variable and text selectors

[11:24:22] <jmpp_> anyone know what that does? I can't find anything relevant in the jQuery API page
[11:37:36] <lintguy> Isn't .on supposed to keep click bindings even if the content updates?
[11:40:58] <walidvb> lintguy: i think you need to bind it to document, and add your selector as a context or smth
[11:44:40] <lintguy> walidvb: It was me, it was supposed to be backwards.
[11:46:16] <tables> how do i send a post or get request with ajax, and then update a div?

[12:26:27] <SyntheCypher> Why is jquery appending an end of an element?
[12:26:34] <SyntheCypher> as in I do

[13:36:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: how goes it
[13:36:33] <frank_o> Morning Rohan_Bhangui !
[13:36:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> morning frank_o
[13:36:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> how goes it
[13:36:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you see the updates?
[13:36:53] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: got some help from walidvb just now to jQuerify your iOS7 range slider: http://jsfiddle.net/DfmH8/2/
[13:37:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol i already did it
[13:37:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> but ill chek it out
[13:37:21] <frank_o> haha really?
[13:37:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: lol yeah. but looking good....very compact.....might use some of it
[13:38:27] <frank_o> what action is behind your range slider anyway?
[13:38:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> .on change
[13:38:54] <frank_o> no i mean like.. what happens when people touch it :D
[13:39:07] <frank_o> what does your app do?
[13:39:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: actually grafi and I are developing a small front end framework for rapid prototyping, basically add css and a bit of js an your site is ready to go
[13:39:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: i have to check
[13:39:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> but im pretty sure it should be fine
[13:39:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: which app
[13:40:16] <frank_o> sounds good would love to maybe use it some time
[13:40:26] <frank_o> oh you got several? haha cool
[13:40:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> no im saying which app you talking about
[13:40:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> the one that the range is being used for?
[13:41:06] <frank_o> oh
[13:41:27] <frank_o> yeah i prior to you telling me about your framework i always figured you were working on some app
[13:42:00] <frank_o> rohanbhangui: yeah i prior to you telling me about your framework i always figured you were working on some app
[13:42:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol rohanbhangui
[13:43:06] <frank_o> that wasnt you?
[13:44:02] <Sal> on a table row click event function, i have $(this).  what command should i append to it to get the text of that rows first column?
[13:45:06] <HexSquid> $(this).children('td:first').text(), possibly?
[13:46:57] <Sal> but shouldn't ($this).cells[0].text work?
[13:48:00] <walidvb> Sal: ($this) has no cells attribute.
[13:48:46] <HexSquid> ($this) ? you mean $(this) ?
[13:48:55] <Sal> yes, sorry
[13:48:59] <Sal> $(this)
[13:49:20] <Sal> but from the tools, i see that it has cells inside the variable list of the object
[13:49:20] <HexSquid> I wouldn't expect to see .cells as a property of a jQuery obj
[13:49:43] <HexSquid> Oh, what happens if you looks at .cells?
[13:49:52] <Sal> ok, i'll try using children()
[13:50:02] <Sal> i see all 9 cells
[13:50:05] <HexSquid> It wouldn't happen to be $(this)[0].cells by chance?
[13:50:19] <Sal> as 9 objects and each has its textContent
[13:50:49] <Sal> no, i was trying $(this).cells[0].text()
[13:51:59] <Sal> anyway, using cells i get: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined (22:51:31:367 | error, javascript)
[13:52:27] <Sal> so, what i see in the debugger variable list is not what jquery has
[13:52:33] <Sal> nice to know that
[13:53:41] <Sal> HexSquid, thanks, childeren() is working well
[14:08:49] <Sal> hey guys, 1 more question... if i clone a <div> and then change things in it, will the original one be changed too?
[14:10:13] <HexSquid> Sal: no, I would expect the clone to be independant of the original
[14:32:28] <megalomix> hello everybody
[14:32:40] <megalomix> guys i have some problem with draggable/sortable

[15:31:41] <lasha1> hi guys
[15:31:56] <lasha1> i want to build a script/plugin
[15:32:03] <lasha1> a cool UI thing
[15:32:07] <lasha1> any ideas?
[16:00:42] <sammych> can someone lend me an assist with this annoying padding on an adjacent div? http://jsfiddle.net/BA7VD/16/
[16:01:05] <sammych> the headers are supposed to be all lined up
[16:01:27] <felixjet> how i can know if an element contains certain parent?
[16:01:43] <sammych> an element contains it's parent?
[16:02:10] <felixjet> maybe something like this? ($(this).parentsUntil('#searchForThis').lenght)
[16:02:13] <sammych> oedipus.js
[16:02:30] <felixjet> i want to know if A is child of B
[16:02:35] <felixjet> on any level
[16:02:47] <sammych> $(this).parent('.class').length > 0
[16:02:54] <felixjet> but parent is direct
[16:02:57] <felixjet> shouldnt be parentS ?
[16:03:02] <sammych> oops
[16:03:08] <felixjet> parentsUntil doesnt work?
[16:03:09] <sammych> $(this).closest('.class').length > 0
[16:03:20] <felixjet> for this i mean
[16:03:28] <sammych> use closest
[16:04:21] <felixjet> "> 0" is needed?
[16:04:25] <felixjet> or just for readbility?
[16:04:36] <felixjet> readibility
[16:04:38] <sammych> sure, if you want
[16:04:48] <sammych> can't be negative, so you're safe :)
[16:11:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: sry got disconnected what you say?
[16:11:45] <felixjet> sammych, works, ty
[16:12:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: u there?
[16:20:02] <sammych> no one wants to help me with a CSS issue? :sadface:
[16:21:55] <BillCriswell> sammych: What was the CSS question
[16:23:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: any news?
[16:30:50] <Sal> hi, i'm filling 2 <p> with text(). can someone tell me why does one of these text start with "  ?
[16:31:09] <Sal> is there something in jquery that adds " to text() ?
[16:32:04] <shoky> Sal: no
[16:32:53] <Sal> i'm jusr creating a string concatebating some values and words. then i add '<br/><br/>' and its not inserted as html but as a string
[16:33:04] <shoky> use .html() for html
[16:33:17] <Sal> but its in the miffles of the <p>
[16:33:23] <Sal> i just need 2 newlines
[16:33:24] <shoky> wat?
[16:33:32] <Sal> middle
[16:33:33] <Sal> sorry
[16:33:48] <shoky> do you want <br/><br/> or not..?
[16:33:57] <Sal> yes
[16:34:04] <Sal> let me explain
[16:34:05] <shoky> then i don't understand the issue
[16:34:29] <Sal> i need to get this: <p>some text<br/><br/>other text</p>
[16:34:41] <Sal> i'm passing all that using .text()
[16:35:07] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[16:35:20] <Sal> ok, wait
[16:39:43] <Sal> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/hwBTn/
[16:40:19] <shoky> Sal: ok, so why not .html() ?
[16:41:20] <Sal> how?
[16:41:30] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/hwBTn/1/
[16:41:32] <Sal> ow....
[16:41:34] <Sal> i got it
[16:41:40] <Sal> you mean the entire string like html
[16:41:46] <Sal> damn, you're right
[16:41:51] <Sal> what i stupid i am
[16:41:58] <shoky> i mean call the .html method instead of the .text method ;p
[16:42:07] <Sal> yes, yes, you're right
[16:42:09] <Sal> its me
[16:42:18] <Sal> maybe its too late to continue coding
[16:42:27] <Sal> need some coffee
[16:42:29] <Sal> thanks
[16:45:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> what up shoky
[16:46:10] <shoky> not much Rohan_Bhangui. how you doin
[16:46:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> meh good
[16:46:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> working on some phonegap stuff
[16:46:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> and a frot end framework thingy
[16:46:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> sort of a 'just add water' and voila
[16:47:10] <shoky> workin is goot
[16:47:39] <shoky> i should do more of that
[16:47:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya...but its always nice to rest ad solve peoples issues in @jquery
[16:47:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[16:47:53] <shoky> heh i hear ya
[16:48:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky if your interested: http://www.appgyver.com/steroids/
[16:48:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> boosts performance of phonegap
[16:50:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: ive been using it for a while
[16:51:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> they have been actively updating, some minor fixes, but major 2 revisions in ot alone
[16:51:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> *oc
[16:51:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> *oct
[16:52:35] <shoky> adunno never used phonegap
[16:52:58] <shoky> saved the link tho, thx
[16:53:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> np
[16:54:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: think of phonegap as being able to write a website for mobile, but then your able to get the full screen for use (as in the address bar and such disappear)
[16:55:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> it wraps html, css, js in a native wrapper
[16:55:10] <shoky> yep i've read about it
[16:57:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky definitely somethign you should explore
[16:57:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol i spent 3 weeks with it and i love it
[16:58:04] <shoky> yea i'll definitely check it out sometime
[16:58:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> hybrid apps are the future
[16:58:22] <shoky> haven't been doing any mobile dev so far
[16:58:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[16:58:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> i hear you
[16:58:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> i only got into mobile dev cause of phonegap
[16:58:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> i much prefer desktop: more real estate
[16:59:08] <shoky> yap
[16:59:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> one thing thats good about mobile is the fact that all browsers adopted webkit
[17:00:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> not like desktop where its segmented
[17:09:35] <felixjet> can someone give me ideas please? i have a input with a button. when you click the button, the text inside the input appears (appendedTo) as a new div like <div>Text</div>
[17:09:54] <felixjet> how i can do to prevent the user from appending the div with the same text twice?
[17:20:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> test whether the first 'text' div contains certain text
[17:20:16] <JackBauer24> felixjet: lol, just use a boolean flag. i.e. set contentAppended variable to true when you append your content
[17:20:55] <felixjet> i end up using a each function
[17:21:08] <felixjet> with a if value == this.text()
[17:21:22] <felixjet> thats a good way to do it?
[17:22:29] <JackBauer24> felixjet: no matter, you can use outside variables inside of $.each. Boolean flag is faster and more logic than checking the div's content
[17:23:25] <felixjet> JackBauer24, can you explain how to do it please?
[17:23:36] <felixjet> my english its not very good and i dont get your point xD
[17:23:52] <felixjet> boolean flag?
[17:23:55] <felixjet> how?
[17:24:00] <felixjet> nice xD
[17:46:36] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui: ...
[17:47:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: you said you were gonna get back to me on something
[17:47:17] <jedimind> i sure did, why are you asking me here ?
[18:14:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you around

[21:01:00] <minty> grafi : to troll or not to troll?
[21:01:42] <grafi> for sharks
[21:06:56] <Cache_Money> I have a contrived example, but I'm trying to figure out how to come step #4 doesn't work  http://jsfiddle.net/eUF4J/1/
[21:10:21] <grafi> Cache_Money http://jsfiddle.net/eUF4J/2/
[21:10:28] <grafi> spot the difference ;)
[21:11:28] <grafi> "#user-output p" doesnt exist at the time you bind to it, thats were delegation comes in, were you register an event on #user-output for all (present and future) p inside #user-output
[21:11:42] <Cache_Money> grafi: ahh
[21:13:26] <Cache_Money> thanks. i've been writing deeply nested event handlers and it didn't seem right
[21:15:08] <tables> how do i do a POST or a GET and put that data in a div?
[21:15:15] <tables> i know it should be simple/short code

[21:41:48] <grafi> whats so hard about that?
[21:42:19] <minty> i wouldnt think much...

[21:43:08] <minty> tables omg
[21:43:26] <grafi> read the damn docs i pointed you at, theres plenty of examples there
[21:43:27] <minty> $.ajax(); or u said its for a json get?
[21:43:56] <minty> $.getJSON(url, function(data){ console.log(data); });
[21:44:27] <minty> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[21:47:29] <tables> can you show me in jsfiddle?
[21:47:30] <tables> lol
[21:48:09] <minty> what r u trying to get?
[21:49:10] <minty> if you wanted to append the data to a div (i think thats what u said)
[21:49:13] <maestrojed>  I have a foreach loop. You can access the current element with $(this). I need the html of a div with a certain class within "this" element. How do I do that? I tried $(this).$('.myClass') and I tried $(this + '.myClass') but I am just guessing
[21:49:52] <huafu> maestrojed: $(this, '.myClass')
[21:50:04] <minty> tables:  ====>       $.getJSON(url, function(data){ $('#myDivId').append(data); });
[21:50:16] <maestrojed> huafu ok. Thanks. I am going to give it a try
[21:51:02] <huafu> I need to do an application with jQuery, can someone  do it  for me?
[21:51:03] <huafu> :p
[21:51:42] <minty> i give up
[21:51:48] <minty> im done reading json for the night lol
[21:52:13] <huafu> {"minty": "why?"}
[21:52:22] <minty> ack
[21:52:24] <grafi> minty reading json isnt hard oô
[21:52:39] <minty> grafi: u never answered my question
[21:52:54] <grafi> what was that?
[21:52:54] <minty> it gets even more complicated when i do a multiaddress query
[21:53:24] <grafi> thats not a question ^^
[21:53:24] <minty> https://blockchain.info/api/json_rpc_api
[21:53:29] <minty> do u have a rest client?
[21:53:44] <grafi> i suppose not
[21:54:16] <Zak> hi. Is there an in-built event for detecting enter press on input?
[21:54:26] <minty> grafi: :(
[21:54:54] <huafu> Zak: google it, keyPress, keyDown, keyUp then event.keyCode
[21:55:08] <Zak> huafu: yeah, I found that solution. It seemed a bit hacky but thanks
[21:55:26] <huafu> Zak: why hacky?
[21:55:26] <joroci> hacky?
[21:55:34] <minty> https://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_api
[21:55:38] <minty> sorry thats the one i meant
[21:56:08] <minty> so if you get:    http://blockchain.info/multiaddr?active=1EoD1U5744xYctoyrUec8jchtGaBiEeLQP|16ozAZaEBoYuh4Ku6qBBJesfax59WceWmY
[21:56:14] <Zak> huafu: i always get worried when specifying key values like that. you're making assumptions about a few things
[21:56:18] <minty> in a browser window
[21:56:24] <grafi> yup
[21:56:35] <Zak> huafu: it's on par with assuming that left-click is a primary click
[21:56:37] <Zak> etc
[21:56:58] <minty> grafi: u see the txs array?
[21:57:00] <Zak> i was just hoping that I overlooked some part of jquery that wrapped it for me :)
[21:57:35] <minty> how do i tell which tx is an input and which is an output? they all have inputs & outputs...
[21:57:48] <huafu> Zak: it depends what you want to do with it, why do you want to listen for the enter key peressed?
[21:58:08] <grafi> minty yes
[21:58:20] <Zak> huafu: my question probably wasn't entirely correct. I just want to know when they "submit" the input.. although it's not in a form
[21:58:35] <Zak> i guess that's a solution, put it in a form and just use the submit event
[21:58:45] <huafu> Zak:  then it SHOULD be in a form and you should listen for the submit event of the form
[21:58:49] <Zak> lol
[21:58:58] <Zak> yeah, i think thats probably the solution i need to go for
[21:59:22] <minty> grafi?
[21:59:25] <huafu> Zak:  then you can cancel the submit event with event.preventDefault() if you're handling it with ajax or so
[21:59:27] <minty> that is the answer?
[21:59:28] <minty> yes?
[21:59:30] <minty> lol
[21:59:32] <Zak> huafu: yeah, i'll do that
[22:00:05] <grafi> minty thats not so much a json question as a "how does the api/format" work question or not?
[22:00:10] <stemid> anyone know why my datepicker days are offset by one? see code here https://github.com/stemid/workshop/blob/master/intresseanmalan/js/intresse.js for example monday 25th shows as 24 in the calendar.
[22:00:14] <huafu> Zak: I have to go now anyway good luck with it but handling the submit event is the best way to do it
[22:00:16] <maestrojed> $(this).html() and $(this, '.myClass').html() are returning the same content. The content of "this". So I don't think that is properly finding the inner div (the one with class=myClass). Did I do something wrong?
[22:00:32] <Zak> huafu: yeah thanks. i'm familiar with the form pattern so I should be good. thanks again
[22:00:53] <huafu> maestrojed: $(this).select('.myClass') isn't working?
[22:00:54] <joroci> stemid they are zero indexed, i'm not sure why
[22:01:28] <huafu> `api select
[22:01:28] <b-ot> huafu: .select(): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[22:01:37] <huafu> arf
[22:01:39] <huafu> nope
[22:01:47] <minty> grafi: i never said it was a json question... just said i was tired of reading json lol
[22:01:54] <grafi> i see
[22:02:15] <minty> you would think they would make it easier to read
[22:02:19] <stemid> joroci: what does that mean? I'm not talking about the daynames in the header, those are correct when I use firstDay: 0. but the actual ordering of dates in the calendar is off by one.
[22:02:25] <joroci> maestrojed this is the parent?
[22:02:28] <grafi> well api design is hard :D
[22:02:40] <joroci> "this"
[22:02:47] <maestrojed> joroci not the direct parent but yes.
[22:02:53] <maestrojed> huafu I am giving that a try
[22:03:04] <minty> grafi: i believe it
[22:03:10] <huafu> maestrojed: nope, I was wrong, I don't remember lol
[22:03:21] <joroci> and do you have only one class with this name?
[22:03:23] <maestrojed> :) Thanks for trying
[22:03:50] <maestrojed> joroci no. There are may divs with that class. But only one that is a child of 'this'
[22:03:53] <huafu> maestrojed: I'm doing such things within my app and it's woeking why it's not with your
[22:04:02] <joroci> so
[22:05:51] <maestrojed> huafu not sure
[22:05:53] <huafu> maestrojed: find() => $(this).find('.myClass')
[22:06:00] <maestrojed> I will try to make a fiddle to test with
[22:06:01] <huafu> `api find
[22:06:02] <stemid> http://jsfiddle.net/VThzs/ here's an example of what I mean. the calendar widget in the second form field shows all dates offset by one.
[22:06:03] <b-ot> huafu: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[22:06:29] <minty> grafi: omg i finally figured out how to read it
[22:06:31] <huafu> ok now I'm leaving ciao
[22:06:35] <minty> so simple lol
[22:06:39] <grafi> ^^
[22:13:32] <stemid> ah I solved it, apparently I should use the regional setting and not define my own arrays of names
[22:13:42] <stemid> then everything worked fine http://jsfiddle.net/VThzs/1/
[23:02:17] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/   <-- why won't this work?   it doesn't seem to grab yahoo.com
[23:21:26] <BrazenBraden_> random question.. i am logged into IRC on my home computer with a registered nick. I am not trying to login with another client from work but my nick is "already inuse" obviously. Is there someway of disconnecting my home connection via an irc command?
[23:21:59] <_rgn> BrazenBraden_: does it matter if the nick is in use?
[23:22:17] <BrazenBraden_> I dont have any other nicks registered and tehre cant be two with the same nick
[23:22:28] <BrazenBraden_> i need my registered nick in order to join the channel
[23:22:30] <_rgn> you can still login to nickserv
[23:22:34] <_rgn> with different nick
[23:22:51] <BrazenBraden_> but that means registering a new one which is a pain
[23:22:55] <_rgn> no it doesnt
[23:23:24] <_rgn>  /msg nickserv identify BrazenBraden mypass
[23:23:29] <BrazenBraden_> this is what im getting when trying to join the RoR channel.. Error(477): #rubyonrails Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[23:23:57] <_rgn> yeah.. just identify
[23:24:05] <BrazenBraden_> oh.
[23:24:08] <BrazenBraden_> it worked O.o
[23:24:11] <BrazenBraden_> thanks! :)
[23:24:27] <BrazenBraden_> i was trying /nick BrazenBraden  first before identifying
[23:24:54] <_rgn> identify assumes your current nick as the username if you don't explicitly write it
[23:25:08] <BrazenBraden_> aight good to know
[23:48:34] <iaj> Hello guys!
[23:49:16] <iaj> When I want a global script that disables a submit button when it has been clicked (for not having doubleposts) -- is there some neat jquery'sh way for doing so?
