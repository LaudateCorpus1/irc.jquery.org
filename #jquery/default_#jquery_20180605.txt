[02:28:04] <evilsun> hi guys
[02:29:02] <evilsun>  need help with jquery on wordpress for the master of any problem
[02:29:05] <evilsun> please :)
[02:30:24] <sine0> can i ask about a plugin that uses jquery like owl carousel or is this pure jquery only
[02:30:40] <pavonia> evilsun: Nobody is able to give help without knowing the exact problem
[02:33:35] <Cork> or at lest the start of it :)
[02:34:03] <evilsun> I have a wordpress page I need to create a button after clicking on the button I want the feature to make it choose the id post and put it on www.site.com/form/ Inserting id
[02:34:05] <evilsun> :)
[02:34:41] <Cork> "choose the id post"?
[02:37:21] <evilsun> how ? :)
[02:37:44] <Cork> you need to provide a lot more info about what you're trying to do
[02:44:31] <evilsun> I will put the button on the button button I want to click on that button to download the next post id to redirect it to another page and put it id post in the url for a concrete prepared subpage
[02:59:07] <evilsun> hmm
[04:56:38] <preference> hi guys, where do i put setinterval() in the code? do i surround my functions with it?
[04:56:52] <preference> setinterval($(".indicator").toggleClass('available', (time >= 9 && time <= 15)), 60000)  ?
[04:56:58] <preference> like this?
[04:59:14] <pavonia> Except for you have to wrap the jQuery call into "function () {...}", I think
[05:03:42] <Cork> ya, and i thought i gave you a working example of that >_>
[05:08:36] <preference> Cork: yours didn't work on mine because i changed the code around and i couldn't see how to adapt it
[07:35:57] <Polochon_gougou> hi! How could I use .find() to select an element that is below a div? I've tried to do .find('div label') to find a <label> that's a children (but not direct) to a div, but it doesn't work
[07:36:26] <Cork> Polochon_gougou: if .find doesn't find it, it isn't a child
[07:36:39] <Cork> most likely it is a sibling or a grand sibling child
[07:37:31] <Polochon_gougou> my hierarchy is like <div><table> ... <label></label></table></div>, isn't it a child?
[07:37:56] <Cork> ya, label isn't valid as children to table, so the dom error correction moves the element
[07:38:30] <Polochon_gougou> ah, clever, thanks :p
[07:38:34] <Cork> i recommend running the page through w3c html5 validator
[07:38:42] <Cork> and fixing the errors it gives you
[07:39:34] <Polochon_gougou> yup I didn't know that <label> was not a valid child for <table>, so thanks :D
[07:39:36] <Polochon_gougou> I'll fix this
[07:40:06] <Cork> only elements that are valid children of table are tbody, thead, tfoot, th and tr
[09:09:44] <Dro> Hello, does on.('change'...) function don't works in Safari browser ?
[09:11:04] <thykka> err.. that doesn't look like a function call to me
[09:11:16] <thykka> .on('change', ..) you mean?
[09:12:24] <FilipNortic_> Dro: the syntax is .on('change', '{selector}', function(){..});
[09:20:03] <Dro> FL1SK: thats the syntax i'm using $('.my-select').on('change', function (e) { .... code ..  }
[09:20:13] <Dro> but it don't have any effect in Safari
[09:21:51] <FilipNortic_> Dro: and it works in chrome or...?
[09:23:14] <FilipNortic_> Dro: and the usall error in theese cases is that '
[09:23:31] <FilipNortic_> .myselct isn't around when you try and bind the handler
[09:24:32] <FilipNortic_> if it works in one browser and not another there might be raceConds somewhere in the code... as far as I know that syntax should work
[09:25:20] <Dro> FilipNortic_: one second let me check the error
[09:25:28] <thykka> seems to be working fine https://jsfiddle.net/98dfgjrz/
[09:27:38] <Cork> .on('') is not browser dependent, it should work in all browsers
[09:28:00] <Cork> if it works in old ie is jquery version dependent though
[09:29:12] <Cork> (1.x works in ie < 9, rest requres ie9)
[09:29:57] <FilipNortic_> and  if it works In one browser and not the other, i would guess some raceCond between element creation and handler binding
[09:30:03] <Cork> Dro: my guess is that your code that binds the event is racy though
[09:30:12] <Cork> and executes to early (or not at all) in safari
[09:30:20] <Cork> yup
[09:30:46] <FilipNortic_> and that is if you know that it work in one browser and not the other
[09:31:12] <thykka> also, does 'has no effect' mean that the event handler does not fire at all, or that the event handler itself doesn't do what it's supposed to?
[09:31:13] <Cork> my first check would be to run console.log($('.my-selector').length) and run it in all browsers and see that you get the same number
[09:31:34] <Cork> and that is to run it right before the $('.my-select').on('change') line
[09:32:31] <Cork> and ya, it could possibly be an if case in the event handler, though it is most commonly that the selector doesn't find the target for some reason
[13:07:09] <Rockwood> i am looking for timer
[13:09:27] <Rockwood> jquery have any predefined timer   ?
[13:11:25] <Rockwood> help me friends
[13:38:17] <Rockwood> any is active ?
[13:38:44] <robertmaxrees> there are people here, sure.
[13:39:20] <Rockwood> jquery have any predefined timer   ? robertmaxrees
[13:39:38] <robertmaxrees> "predefined timer"
[13:39:42] <robertmaxrees> elaborate
[13:39:42] <Rockwood> inbuilt
[13:39:54] <robertmaxrees> what is a "predefined timer"?  what are you trying to do?
[13:40:16] <Rockwood> actually i want use timer in my quiz based app
[13:40:28] <Rockwood> reverse countdown timer
[13:40:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't have anything for that.
[13:40:51] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/ is everything in the core jquery api.
[13:42:13] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, or any simple and good in use based on jquery
[13:42:46] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to make sure people don't take longer than a certain amount of time?
[13:43:15] <robertmaxrees> or are you just trying to see how long they take?
[13:45:25] <Rockwood> i am want run timer only for few hrs
[13:45:33] <Rockwood> i want to *
[13:45:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's pretty trivial to setup yourself.
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> no need for a plugin/.
[13:46:13] <Rockwood> really i noob in jquery so can't
[13:46:34] <robertmaxrees> you don't use jquery for it.
[13:46:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery is for DOM manipulation mostly.
[13:46:47] <robertmaxrees> a timer is not DOM manipulation.
[13:47:46] <Rockwood> so plain JS ?
[13:47:51] <robertmaxrees> yar
[13:48:02] <Rockwood> JS and some CSS
[13:48:12] <robertmaxrees> and html, probably ;0
[13:48:15] <robertmaxrees> * ;)
[13:48:45] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, http://hilios.github.io/jQuery.countdown/  looks nice timer
[13:49:09] <Rockwood> underneath Next year begins in:
[13:49:20] <robertmaxrees> then use it?
[13:51:15] <Rockwood> its in .net tag in it
[13:51:24] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:51:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:51:33] <Rockwood> no
[13:51:52] <Rockwood> pointless words sorry
[14:21:28] <atestses> helo everyone
[14:21:38] <atestses> I have a basic question
[14:21:41] <robertmaxrees> hola
[14:22:31] <atestses> I would like to hide a div, and after the animatio ends, start other hide div
[14:22:38] <atestses> but my code doesnt work
[14:22:41] <atestses> example
[14:23:04] <atestses> $("#div01).hide("slow")
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[14:23:22] <atestses> $("#div02).hide("slow")
[14:23:36] <atestses> the two divs hide at same time
[14:23:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:24:32] <robertmaxrees> you have a few ways to do that.

[14:32:04] <atestses> robertmaxrees, that's work :), thanks man
[14:33:18] <Rhaal>  Greetings! I'd like to invoke an object method within a jQuery.click, while passing info about the clicked element
[14:35:49] <Rhaal> http://paste.debian.net/1028090/
[15:40:55] <laravelfreako> if I generate a dynamic list of checkboxes using ajax and jquery is it possible to create an event for when this checkboxes are clicks since they are not loaded in the initial DOM?
[15:41:20] <robertmaxrees> Rhaal so what's the confusion?
[15:41:30] <robertmaxrees> laravelfreako use delegated handlers instead.
[15:41:46] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:41:51] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:41:59] <robertmaxrees> ^ these cover the subject pretty well.
[15:42:46] <Rhaal> robertmaxrees, the only way I've found to pass data about the clicking item is though a direct invocation of the method, instead of using this
[15:42:49] <laravelfreako> thank you!
[15:43:01] <robertmaxrees> Rhaal aaah - since 'this' isn't the element, you're trying to find an alternative.
[15:43:02] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[15:43:06] <robertmaxrees> the event object has a reference./
[15:43:16] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[15:43:22] <robertmaxrees> or event.currentTarget, depending
[15:45:07] <Rhaal> : O Thank you!
[15:45:43] <Rhaal> Another question, if I may: I'm building some html in a string, then calling append, and then trying to bind some functions to the click of the appended elements
[15:45:49] <Rhaal> For some reason, it's not working
[15:46:04] <robertmaxrees> see my prior links about event delegation :)
[15:46:42] <Rhaal> Ahah, nice combo!
[15:47:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:07:46] <Rhaal> robertmaxrees, really, thanks! You saved my sleep! : D
[16:09:39] <robertmaxrees> sure!
[16:09:44] <robertmaxrees> why we're here :)
[17:03:35] <DreamStiffler> hi
[17:03:38] <DreamStiffler> any sifoos here
[17:04:41] <robertmaxrees> "sifoos"?
[17:04:52] <DreamStiffler> guru
[17:04:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:05:11] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask.  if somebody can help, they will :)
[17:05:13] <DreamStiffler> im learning to use .load
[17:05:23] <DreamStiffler> always learning never master
[17:05:37] <DreamStiffler> im loading another jsp file which has a table
[17:05:44] <DreamStiffler> with a few rows
[17:06:04] <DreamStiffler> so on the current page i want to load that table but only up to 5 results
[17:06:31] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to do this.
[17:06:41] <robertmaxrees> do you control the other page you're trying to grab data from?
[17:06:50] <DreamStiffler> also the table from the jsp im loading from ha alternate tr . one with data and one with lines. just seperator lines.
[17:06:55] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: i dont
[17:07:03] <robertmaxrees> that's... unfortunate.
[17:07:13] <DreamStiffler> its the same server , no CORS issue
[17:07:20] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[17:07:20] <DreamStiffler> but i dont have permission on that file
[17:07:24] <robertmaxrees> wtf.
[17:07:40] <robertmaxrees> either way, you'll need to parse out the trs, find some way to identify the ones you want, and then append those.
[17:08:07] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: sounds like an idea. but how do i do that
[17:08:09] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, yell at whoever is in charge of that file and tell them to give you an API with pagination and stuff.
[17:08:15] <robertmaxrees> how do you do what?
[17:08:17] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[17:09:09] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: yes , that would be easy for me. but no i have to do it this way
[17:09:20] <DreamStiffler> what i want is similar to this
[17:09:22] <DreamStiffler> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35863666/jquery-load-only-last-n-lines-of-a-page
[17:09:32] <robertmaxrees> DreamStiffler so...
[17:09:33] <DreamStiffler> but i have problem seperating the alternate tr
[17:09:35] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting stuck?
[17:09:40] <robertmaxrees> okay/.
[17:09:48] <robertmaxrees> so make a fiddle and we can tackle that problem :)
[17:11:10] <DreamStiffler> well im not sure how do i fiddle it as i will be needing 2 files
[17:11:21] <robertmaxrees> newp
[17:11:28] <robertmaxrees> you have to break the problem down.
[17:11:29] <DreamStiffler> whats newp
[17:11:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:11:35] <robertmaxrees> newp=nope
[17:11:43] <robertmaxrees> focus on the table part for now.
[17:11:46] <robertmaxrees> ignore the ajax.
[17:11:50] <robertmaxrees> can do that part later.
[17:11:58] <DreamStiffler> let me try
[17:12:12] <DreamStiffler> itll take some time
[17:12:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ <- stick a basic version of the table in the html box here.
[17:12:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:12:29] <robertmaxrees> it should take like 60 seconds to just grab that markup.
[17:16:03] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[17:19:00] <DreamStiffler> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/t1cmhw3x/6/
[17:19:05] <DreamStiffler> the closest i could get
[17:19:19] <robertmaxrees> that's fine/.
[17:19:34] <robertmaxrees> okay so we're going to ignore the load
[17:20:09] <robertmaxrees> so.
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> what's something that differentiates the TRs?
[17:20:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/t1cmhw3x/9/ <- w/ jquery added btw
[17:21:19] <robertmaxrees> DreamStiffler
[17:21:23] <DreamStiffler> yea
[17:21:26] <DreamStiffler> the data
[17:21:30] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:21:32] <DreamStiffler> thats what differentiates
[17:21:33] <robertmaxrees> so!
[17:21:50] <DreamStiffler> thx for adding the jquery
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> you only want the ones with data, right?
[17:22:01] <DreamStiffler> yes sir
[17:22:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t1cmhw3x/11/
[17:22:39] <robertmaxrees> so how do you get ALL trs that are children of $sometable ?
[17:23:31] <robertmaxrees> rather, descendents.  not children.
[17:24:19] <DreamStiffler> find?
[17:24:59] <robertmaxrees> :) give it a shot!
[17:25:06] <DreamStiffler> or children
[17:25:14] <robertmaxrees> which do you think?
[17:26:18] <robertmaxrees> >>>
[17:26:22] <robertmaxrees> *>.>
[17:26:38] <robertmaxrees> (in general, you want to use .find() over .children()
[17:26:43] <robertmaxrees> just fyi)
[17:27:07] <robertmaxrees> so now you'll have your TRs - now you just want to filter() out the ones you don't want.
[17:29:24] <robertmaxrees> >>>
[17:30:04] <DreamStiffler> errr
[17:30:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:30:21] <robertmaxrees> lol gotta work with me here duder.  if you get stuck, gotta say something :)
[17:30:47] <DreamStiffler> ok i suck. im not even ure if my syntax is right
[17:30:50] <DreamStiffler> check 17
[17:30:55] <robertmaxrees> link it.
[17:31:29] <robertmaxrees> (i don't keep the fiddles open always)
[17:31:31] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/t1cmhw3x/17/
[17:31:38] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:31:50] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:32:07] <robertmaxrees> so if you want all trs that are children of $sometable
[17:32:19] <robertmaxrees> that means you want ot start with $sometable and then use .find() off that
[17:34:05] <robertmaxrees> still lost?
[17:34:35] <DreamStiffler> 19
[17:34:39] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:34:43] <robertmaxrees> don't have it open any more lol
[17:34:49] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/t1cmhw3x/19/
[17:34:59] <robertmaxrees> oh, find takes a string.
[17:35:00] <robertmaxrees> 'tr'
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> that's generally the case with selectors in jquery.
[17:35:22] <robertmaxrees> needs to be a string.
[17:35:38] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't need that document ready in there.
[17:35:58] <DreamStiffler> ack
[17:36:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t1cmhw3x/24/
[17:36:43] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:37:08] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/t1cmhw3x/26/
[17:37:20] <robertmaxrees> same diff :)
[17:37:49] <robertmaxrees> okay so - now you want to filter those down
[17:38:13] <DreamStiffler> wow wow
[17:38:15] <DreamStiffler> wait
[17:38:18] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:38:22] <DreamStiffler> i just saw the console
[17:38:25] <DreamStiffler> so many detail
[17:38:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:38:44] <DreamStiffler> ok yeah i want to filter them down
[17:38:45] <robertmaxrees> ignore those for now.
[17:39:06] <DreamStiffler> ok
[17:39:16] <robertmaxrees> so the cool thing about filter is you can give it a function
[17:39:17] <DreamStiffler> distraction distraction
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t1cmhw3x/27/
[17:40:42] <DreamStiffler> ok.
[17:40:47] <DreamStiffler> imma read up filter for a bit
[17:40:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:40:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:40:57] <robertmaxrees> duder trust me :)
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> so $(this) is the current element.
[17:41:48] <robertmaxrees> and in this case, $(this) will be each TR.  so you can do some kind of test to see if you want to keep it or not.
[17:42:32] <robertmaxrees> so what kind of test could you do?
[17:43:08] <DreamStiffler> if its not containing -
[17:43:13] <DreamStiffler> or if its odd
[17:43:18] <robertmaxrees> i would go with the contents.
[17:43:34] <DreamStiffler> meaning
[17:43:42] <robertmaxrees> the first one you said.
[17:43:44] <robertmaxrees> not the odd.
[17:43:53] <DreamStiffler> i trust you i just need to get an idea of what it is
[17:43:59] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:44:36] <robertmaxrees> so how would you check if a descendent <td> just contains a -
[17:46:18] <jak2000> hi all
[17:46:22] <jak2000> anyone alive?
[17:46:34] <robertmaxrees> almost 340 people in here ;)
[17:46:44] <robertmaxrees> DreamStiffler anything?
[17:46:49] <Robdgreat> so please feel free to just go straight to your actual question :)
[17:46:51] <jak2000> :)
[17:46:58] <jak2000> sorry
[17:46:58] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat++++++++++
[17:47:11] <jak2000> https://paste.debian.net/1028125/   <-- why  type anything in my input and lost the focus?
[17:47:24] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:47:26] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:47:37] <Robdgreat> that doesn't look like a fiddle to me
[17:47:50] <robertmaxrees> nor is that much of a problem statement.
[17:48:01] <Robdgreat> jak2000: it would be helpful if you could create a test case in jsfiddle
[17:48:14] <robertmaxrees> with only the relevant code
[17:48:52] <jak2020> sample: 3 (i cant typing) but when type .  it stop... and cant continue typing
[17:48:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m63bhcwn/ jak2000 that code, as-is, doesn't "stop"
[17:51:15] <robertmaxrees> DreamStiffler you stuck again?
[17:51:44] <DreamStiffler> of course
[17:51:45] <DreamStiffler> https://jsfiddle.net/t1cmhw3x/38/
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:52:14] <robertmaxrees> so how would you check if the first td's text is just '-' ?
[17:52:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:52:40] <DreamStiffler> [0] ?
[17:52:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:52:50] <DreamStiffler> thats what i was trying to fig out
[17:53:03] <DreamStiffler> each?
[17:53:12] <robertmaxrees> .eq(0) instead of [0]
[17:54:46] <robertmaxrees> and then how do you get the text?
[17:56:21] <DreamStiffler> .eq(2) ??
[17:56:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:29] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:56:34] <robertmaxrees> .eq(0) gets you the element.
[17:56:45] <robertmaxrees> .text() is how you get the text.
[17:56:51] <DreamStiffler> damnit
[17:57:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:57:07] <robertmaxrees> it's ok.
[17:57:11] <robertmaxrees> that's why we're stepping through it.

[17:58:03] <DreamStiffler> text is similar to html right
[17:58:06] <DreamStiffler> similar not same
[17:58:11] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:58:22] <robertmaxrees> where's your .eq(0)?>
[17:58:34] <robertmaxrees> and i mean, html and text both return strings.
[17:58:40] <DreamStiffler> no idea man
[17:58:42] <robertmaxrees> but i wouldn't say they're otherwise similar.

[17:59:32] <jak2020> trange in the fiddle not fail
[17:59:40] <jak2020> test: https://jsfiddle.net/m63bhcwn/9/
[17:59:43] <DreamStiffler> why eq(0)
[17:59:51] <DreamStiffler> can explain?
[17:59:53] <robertmaxrees> DreamStiffler because you want that first td.
[18:00:04] <robertmaxrees> instead of the text of all the TDs.
[18:00:14] <DreamStiffler> why only first td?
[18:00:25] <robertmaxrees> because it's a quick and easy test in this case.
[18:00:28] <robertmaxrees> you can expand on it later.
[18:00:31] <DreamStiffler> okay
[18:00:35] <DreamStiffler> please go on

[18:10:05] <jak2020> removed the line...
[18:17:10] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:18:03] <jak2020> yes
[18:18:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:18:18] <robertmaxrees> are you asking for help or..?
[18:18:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:18:45] <jak2020> robertmaxrees wich recommend me for send messages? push messages, firebase? or?
[18:18:56] <robertmaxrees> "for send messages" how?
[18:19:08] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for browser push notifications?
[18:19:21] <jak2020> yes
[18:19:33] <jak2020> send messages to devices (phones) by sample
[18:19:49] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to make a firebase account no matter what.
[18:19:56] <robertmaxrees> sooo that'
[18:20:12] <robertmaxrees> *that's kind of your only option :)
[18:21:21] <jak2020> only firebase?
[18:21:25] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:21:33] <robertmaxrees> firebase is how you send push notifications
[18:21:51] <jak2020> ok other question, wich repository use? github?
[18:22:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:22:29] <jak2020> like you bitbucket?
[18:22:39] <robertmaxrees> totally up to your needs and desires.
[18:22:41] <robertmaxrees> i prefer github.
[18:22:53] <robertmaxrees> other people prefer bitbucket or gitlab
[18:25:17] <jak2020> but github haven private account only paying?
[18:27:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:27:20] <robertmaxrees> depends on your needs.
[18:28:50] <jak2020> bitbucket have a 3gb of free space anon... like me :)
[18:29:33] <robertmaxrees> then use that.
[18:30:38] <jak2020> sorry 2gb
[18:30:41] <jak2020> yes
[18:30:59] <jak2020> wich framework do you use robertmaxrees?
[18:31:03] <jak2020> bootstrap?
[18:31:04] <robertmaxrees> tho i gotta ask: why does your repo need to be private?
[18:31:12] <robertmaxrees> and it depends on the project.
[18:32:49] <jak2020> in the city have some ppl that want my code....
[18:33:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:33:13] <robertmaxrees> uh-huh.
[18:33:38] <robertmaxrees> either way, asking "what framework do you use" is a pretty loaded question.  for what?  what's the project?  does it need a frontend framework?
[18:33:59] <robertmaxrees> also: bootstrap isn't really a frontend framework
[18:37:09] <jak2020> for all projects
[18:37:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:37:20] <jak2020> for sample, i am use bootstrap in all projects
[18:37:27] <jak2020> i love it (jeje not now other)
[18:37:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea fwiw.
[18:37:53] <jak2020> why?
[18:37:55] <jak2020> explain me please
[18:38:25] <robertmaxrees> are you just adding it because or are you evaluating your options each time?
[18:41:23] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:41:25] <jak2020> i am adding and use....
[18:41:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked.
[18:41:34] <jak2020> wich other recommend me to learn?
[18:41:45] <robertmaxrees> sometimes no library is the right choice.
[18:41:49] <jak2020> explain me more: "evaluating your options"
[18:41:55] <robertmaxrees> sometimes a different library is the right choice
[18:42:07] <Robdgreat> "when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail" seems to apply here
[18:42:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:42:27] <jak2020> Robdgreat is a bot
[18:42:42] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:42:43] <Robdgreat> no
[18:42:46] <robertmaxrees> pure.css, material, semantic...
[18:42:54] <robertmaxrees> tons of choices.
[18:43:16] <jak2020> material
[18:43:17] <jak2020> design?
[18:43:28] <robertmaxrees> there's also a library for itl.
[18:43:30] <robertmaxrees> *it
[18:45:25] <jak2020> not linke me touch the css
[18:45:29] <jak2020> is hard
[18:45:33] <jak2020> and slow slow
[18:45:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:45:46] <robertmaxrees> there's also tachyons css.
[18:45:50] <jak2020> robertbo[m] can you share 1 site developed by you?
[18:45:50] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices.
[18:46:01] <jak2020> give me 1 or 2 choices please
[18:46:05] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[18:46:19] <jak2020> link please
[18:46:22] <robertmaxrees> to what?
[18:46:36] <jak2020> this: https://tachyons.io/
[18:46:36] <jak2020> ?
[18:46:44] <robertmaxrees> that's one option, sure.
[18:47:33] <jak2020> interesting
[18:47:38] <jak2020> recommend me 1 site please about tachyons
[18:47:49] <robertmaxrees> you have it there...
[18:48:00] <jak2020> :)
[18:48:11] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=tachyons+css
[18:48:42] <jak2020> yes same link
[18:48:48] <robertmaxrees> and some others.
[18:48:50] <robertmaxrees> what's your point?
[18:49:11] <jak2020> i want more buttons
[18:49:15] <jak2020> yes understand the point..
[18:49:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:49:32] <jak2020> friend you use, typescript?
[18:49:52] <robertmaxrees> do I?  not often.  some people here in the office do.
[18:51:06] <jak2020> is good technique to use?
[18:51:20] <robertmaxrees> again
[18:51:24] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're building.
[18:51:50] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way: would you use a screwdriver if you've got nails?
[18:51:54] <robertmaxrees> or would you use a hammer?
[18:52:29] <jak2020> no no hammer
[18:52:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:52:59] <jak2020> i think bootstrap and typescript is similar to water, beer, coffe, coke,
[18:53:04] <Robdgreat> would you say it's unwise to never learn about any tool but a hammer because it does such a good job on nails?
[18:53:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:53:25] <robertmaxrees> learn different things.
[18:53:28] <Robdgreat> unfortunately, not everything is a nail
[18:53:29] <robertmaxrees> keep expanding your skillset.
[18:54:16] <Robdgreat> you don't have to thoroughly learn the ins and outs of every tool out there, but it's useful to learn what's out there and generally what it does
[18:54:23] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[18:54:34] <robertmaxrees> instead of saying "should i use typescript + bootstrap for every projects", you should ask "what are the right tools here?  do I need type safety?  does bootstrap make my life easier?"
[18:54:35] <Robdgreat> so that when you encounter a problem better suited to another tool, you've seen it and can go and learn it
[18:54:55] <jak2020> mmmm
[18:55:09] <jak2020> understand..
