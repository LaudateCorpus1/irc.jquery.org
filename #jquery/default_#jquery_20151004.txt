[04:41:26] <Rudeboy> Hey guys, I am trying to substitute an html SELECT dropdown with UL and Jquery. The following works, but I don't know how to use the "name" attribute (ie, <select name="example">): http://jsfiddle.net/Starx/a6NJk/2/
[04:41:37] <Rudeboy> Does anyone have any idea as to how I could do it?
[05:43:02] <FoxyCyborg> anyone here?
[06:27:15] <fattest> how do i make my box only move 250px left and right? http://jsfiddle.net/5Gq7L/597/
[06:27:30] <carpii> COuld someone help explain this in the docs please...   The description for 'dataType' param in $.ajax, states "The available types (and the result passed as the first argument to your success callback) are:".    But Im not seeing the datatype passed back as the first param. The first param is the actual response text
[06:34:26] <fattest> anyone?
[06:34:38] <somenoob> Hey :)
[06:35:24] <fattest> hello
[07:58:00] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I want to insert an custom icon into my jquery accordion. The problem is this: As soon as I click to the accordion, that icon is changed to "arrow-down". How can I prevent that?
[08:18:04] <Kartagis> JosefDe: jqm?
[08:18:13] <JosefDe> Kartagis: What do you mean with jqm?
[08:18:22] <Kartagis> jquery mobile
[08:18:32] <JosefDe> No. I'm using normal jQuery UI
[08:18:38] <Kartagis> hrm
[08:19:15] <Kartagis> you may want to search for using custom icons
[08:19:28] <Kartagis> in jqm, it was :after
[08:19:47] <Kartagis> maybe jq-ui has something similar
[08:20:08] <JosefDe> the problem is this: I want to insert a link-icon, which shouldn't be changed when I click the accordion
[08:30:18] <JosefDe> has noone any idea?
[08:41:02] <Kartagis> not me, sorry
[08:43:29] <lalalaaa> shoky: can we update the topic please?
[08:44:55] <lord_rob> Hi! Is there a built-in method into jQuery to check if a number is an integer or not?
[08:46:50] <robhol> there are LIMITS to what you need jquery for..
[08:47:15] <Kartagis> http://stackoverflow.com/a/10270683/1384283
[08:47:20] <Kartagis> lord_rob: ^
[08:47:23] <robhol> just x % 1 == 0 or floor(x) == x should work, surely?
[08:48:15] <robhol> gawd, Javascript's type system :(
[08:55:25] <JosefDe> has anyone an idea?
[08:55:50] <lalalaaa> JosefDe: When asking for help always include a reduced test case: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[09:08:56] <lord_rob> thanks Kartagis
[09:28:59] <JosefDe> elo? Any prö in here whö can hülp?
[09:29:18] <JosefDe> I'm stück with ü prüblem
[09:36:27] <JosefDe> man.. I feel desperate
[09:37:47] <robhol> o rly
[09:40:30] <JosefDe> I have this problem: http://jsfiddle.net/d6mSA/822/
[09:40:49] <JosefDe> I only want to use "clickme" as link and I want it not to slide the accordion
[10:07:44] <JosefDe> can anyone help me?
[10:22:26] <Uhkis> JosefDe: $('.accordionlink a').on('click', function() { window.location = $(this).href; });
[10:24:30] <JosefDe> Uhkis: Alright. And how do I avoid the custom-icon to be changed to "arrow-down" when I click the link?
[10:25:48] <Uhkis> what custom icon
[10:26:06] <JosefDe> Uhkis: Your last suggestion doesn't work. The accordion is still opened, when I click the link
[10:29:45] <shoky> lalalaaa: update it to what?
[10:34:10] <JosefDe> Has anyone experience with jQuery UI's accordion?
[10:34:19] <JosefDe> I'm really about crying
[10:34:58] <shoky> JosefDe:  http://jsfiddle.net/d6mSA/826/
[10:37:17] <JosefDe> shoky: Ok. Let me have a lookt at that
[10:38:07] <lalalaaa> shoky: was thinking maybe we could simplify it a bit, and maybe also get in that link about reduced test cases.. ie.:
[10:38:54] <JosefDe> shoky: Perfect! Only 1 problem remains:
[10:39:07] <lalalaaa> /topic jquery.com | jquerymobile.com | jqueryui.com | Need help? First read: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ | Test cases: jsfiddle.net jsbin.com | Rules & logs: bit.ly/jQIRCCoC | Beginners: try.jquery.com | Developers: #jquery-dev #jqueryui-dev
[10:39:23] <JosefDe> shoky: On the left side of that link I have a <span class="icon-..">. If I click on the accordion normally, this icon gets changed to "icon-down". How can I avoid that?
[10:39:30] <lalalaaa> something like that idk..
[10:40:41] <shoky> lalalaaa: those links don't appear as links in many irc clients (well, mine at least). i donno, never changed the topic myself, people from the jquery team have done it. i'd rather not start now ;)  also it seems fine to me as is
[10:41:07] <lalalaaa> lol.. ah ok yeah good point
[10:41:08] <JosefDe> Ah. I have the position
[10:41:09] <JosefDe> ok
[10:41:19] <JosefDe> lalalaaa: You have a nice name
[10:41:28] <lalalaaa> JosefDe: haha thanks man :-)
[10:41:30] <JosefDe> lalalaaa: How long did it take to find this name?
[10:41:32] <lalalaaa> JosefDe: that made my day ;)
[10:41:44] <lalalaaa> was the first thing that came to mind
[10:42:06] <lalalaaa> im a singer you see..
[10:42:17] <JosefDe> lalalaaa: Ok. You have to be a very creative minded person, like Mozart. Probably you we're writing some lyrics in your mind and that popped out..
[10:42:44] <lalalaaa> hehe you're far too kind JosefDe :-)
[10:42:46] <JosefDe> lalalaaa: I also want to sing "lalalaa" to life.. But haven't managed doing it so far ^^
[10:43:01] <lalalaaa> well its a lot of fun.. especially in the shower
[10:43:15] <JosefDe> lalalaaa: Ok. I don't want to know what you're doing under the shower..
[10:43:26] <lalalaaa> then you can switch it up and start rapping as well.. which does wonders for your confidence / emotions imho
[10:43:29] <shoky> JosefDe: you want that triangle icon to not change when closing the accordion panel?
[10:43:31] <JosefDe> lalalaaa: Keep it to yourself please :)
[10:43:48] <JosefDe> shoky: I've found the position. I think I can fix that myself. If not I'll come back
[10:43:55] <shoky> oks
[10:44:05] <JosefDe> Do you guys all have a wife?
[10:44:12] <JosefDe> (married)
[10:44:23] <shoky> i doubt everybody here is a guy
[10:44:34] <JosefDe> Yeah. I think lalalaaa is not a guy
[10:44:36] <shoky> i'm not married, in any case
[10:44:59] <JosefDe> shoky: Why not?
[10:45:11] <JosefDe> shoky: Haven't find a wife?
[10:46:00] <shoky> do i have to?
[10:46:17] <shoky> weird questions, JosefDe :)
[10:48:14] <JosefDe> shoky: Yes.. indeed..
[10:48:15] <Uhkis> very
[10:48:26] <JosefDe> I'm a weird guy..
[10:48:39] <shoky> that's ok, most of us are
[10:49:12] <Uhkis> i wouldnt say most
[10:49:26] <Uhkis> depends on the definition of weird tho
[10:50:25] <shoky> non-weird people are weird in that they're not weird, so... weirdos
[10:52:18] <Kartagis> ?mdn reduce
[10:52:52] <Kartagis> ?api reduce
[10:52:52] <b-ot> we got dat
[10:53:06] <JosefDe> Yeah. That's the point. If you don't belong to the majority then you're labled as "weird" very quickly these days
[10:53:21] <JosefDe> People have no real understanding for different-minded people, which differ from majority
[10:54:24] <JosefDe> Be nice, be funny, talk a lot, be cool...
[11:50:16] <arup_r> guys.. I am using  http://getfuelux.com/javascript.html#wizard .. Now, I want some functionality to add. What I want is, to prevent user to the next step if a particular field in the first step is empty
[11:50:24] <arup_r> What is the method to do so ?
[11:51:00] <arup_r> If the particular field is empty, and the user click the next button, I want user to be in the same step.
[11:52:54] <shoky> arup_r: read the docs.  Events  actionclicked.fu.wizard   This event fires immediately when the step changes, but before the wizard shows the new step. Use event.preventDefault() to cancel the event.
[11:53:38] <arup_r> shoky: I tried the method .wizard('next') by returning false .. and it didn't work
[11:53:45] <arup_r> let me see what you ponited
[11:54:10] <arup_r> shoky: let me try
[11:54:10] <shoky> .wizard('next')  just changes to the next step.  not what you want
[11:54:34] <arup_r> yes. you are right. That's why it didn't work
[11:55:42] <jkoudys> can $ be used to build a basic pubsub pattern, similar to events.EventEmitter, or does every event need to be bound to an actual DOM element?
[11:57:59] <shoky> jkoudys: you can have jquery events triggered for any object,  see for example ben alman's tiny pubsub implementation
[11:58:44] <shoky> could probably also use $.Callbacks
[11:58:53] <jkoudys> yeah that's exactly the API I'm looking to use
[12:00:39] <jkoudys> shoky, hmm, managing the scope on $.Callbacks() doesn't look too elegant. I'd have to push it into global if I wanted to make good use of that
[12:01:24] <shoky> push what into global?
[12:01:33] <jkoudys> the return from $.Callbacks()
[12:01:45] <shoky> why global?
[12:02:05] <jkoudys> you're essentially defining the event type using that, correct? Like `window.cbs = $.Callbacks()`, so I can pub and sub to it from other scopes
[12:02:51] <shoky> it doesn't have to be global to be accessible from somewhere else
[12:04:36] <jkoudys> so it looks like the answer to my first question was yes, $ does need to bind to an element, but that you could just wrap that element as a function-scoped variable to build your pubsub
[12:04:37] <shoky> this has an example of using $.Callbacks  for this  https://gist.github.com/addyosmani/1321768
[12:04:59] <jkoudys> since that's all tiny pubsub really is -- builds a $({}), then defines publish subscribe methods to the $.fn.on
[12:05:09] <shoky> {}  is not an element
[12:06:25] <jkoudys> oh right; not a DOM element, but it's a jQuery element (or whatever nomenclature they've defined around that)
[12:06:48] <shoky> {} is just a plain js object.  $({})  is a jquery object wrapping that plain js object
[12:07:23] <shoky> so it's just jquery events being triggered on this object, not on any DOM element
[12:07:43] <jkoudys> So he's just taking the DOM out of the equation, and simply using an empty object so we can run the same functions that are normally used by jQuery to apply against the DOM
[12:07:47] <jkoudys> which is exactly what I wanted to do
[12:07:52] <shoky> pretty much yep
[12:08:06] <shoky> that's why it was my first suggestion ;p
[12:09:23] <jkoudys> that's actually a pretty clever technique I can use a lot of sites, where I want to apply my typical reactjs patterns, but still use their old jquery 1.7 framework to do it
[12:09:39] <jkoudys> thanks a lot shoky
[12:09:49] <shoky> yw
[12:10:52] <arup_r> shoky: Thanks, mate. It worked.
[12:11:20] <shoky> sweet
[12:18:00] <Whiskey> How can i get the second last char whit slice?
[12:18:26] <Whiskey> -2 will get the two last but :)
[12:19:10] <jkoudys> I'm just noticing how funny it is that devs are so strict about not modifying builtin prototypes, because it might cause future collisions, but jQuery devs will just modify the jQuery object without batting an eye. This guy just defines publish/subscribe/unsubscribe in lib that does nothing but define some sugar and manage 1 in-scope variable
[12:19:37] <shoky> Whiskey:  .slice(-2,-1)
[12:19:43] <jkoudys> and yet, it makes perfectly good sense here, but if I had someone checking in libs adding to Array.prototype, I'd probably go and smack them
[12:19:43] <Whiskey> aaa :D
[12:19:46] <Whiskey> yeh i found it out :D
[13:54:44] <jak2000> hi have a input texts on a html table: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/1ecnm9h1/12/  how do, when los the focus a input, do a sum and the result write on the div sidebar?
[14:15:54] <shoky> jak2000: use the change event and then add up all the values. what's the problem
[14:17:47] <jak2000> ok do the job
[14:17:55] <shoky> what?
[14:17:56] <jak2000> wich is better shoky blur or change?
[14:18:04] <shoky> it's not a question of better
[14:18:12] <shoky> what functionality do you want
[14:18:26] <shoky> change doesn't trigger if you didnt update the value
[14:18:56] <jak2000> then blur :)
[14:18:59] <shoky> why?
[14:19:02] <jak2000> thanks and i understand
[14:20:46] <jak2000> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/1ecnm9h1/20/
[14:20:48] <jak2000> good job?
[14:22:03] <shoky> jak2000: sure.  i'd prolly do it like this, pretty similar but main difference is using event delegation. http://jsfiddle.net/1ecnm9h1/19/
[14:22:32] <shoky> but yea using a class like you did is better
[14:23:51] <jak2000> shoky your way fail, test in both fiddles:
[14:24:06] <jak2000> in the first input (on any) clear the value, empty and continue writing numbers
[14:24:28] <shoky> you didn't say what should happen when there is no value ;)
[14:24:59] <jak2000> ok
[14:25:17] <shoky> anyway NaN seems like the right result to me :P
[14:25:53] <jak2000> why?
[14:25:55] <jak2000> :)
[14:26:15] <jak2000> shoky wich is the programming language in server side?
[14:26:19] <jak2000> jsp? php?
[14:26:19] <shoky> because the sum of empty value is not a number :P
[14:26:34] <shoky> what do you mean?  what server ?
[14:26:42] <jak2000> i want ignore invalid numbers
[14:26:52] <shoky> hopefully neither jsp or php :)
[14:27:00] <jak2000> and continue summing
[14:27:04] <jak2000> you know jsp?
[14:27:05] <shoky> ok then ignore them
[14:27:07] <shoky> yeah
[14:28:26] <jak2000> accept a private message?
[14:29:22] <shoky> mm why not here?
[14:30:10] <shoky> but ok, if it's really private ;)
[14:30:45] <shoky> er, if it's a jsp question though.. there are probably channels for that :S

[14:33:10] <lalalaaa> lol sorry
[15:14:56] <jak2000> shoky are you there?
[15:16:38] <shoky> jak2000 yea
[15:18:23] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/r0nwbn9b/3/  man how to do: 1) when user select any option (on select-option) send the focus to the next input,and select all? and 2) if the selection was  NONE (value=0) not sum, thanks
[15:37:04] <shoky> jak2000:  what's the problem with #2 ?
[15:37:27] <shoky> to focus and select an input you can call  .focus().select()  on it
[15:38:00] <jak2000> yes but how to know the input
[15:38:35] <shoky> $(this).closest('tr').find('.qty')
[15:38:53] <jak2000> ok
[15:38:54] <jak2000> testing
[15:39:57] <Perseus0> can't figure why after the function is over, the initial behavior isn't contemplated http://laravel.io/bin/QNQR1
[15:40:10] <Perseus0> the hover() never quite works for some reason
[15:42:11] <shoky> the behavior isn't contemplated? wat?
[15:42:59] <Perseus0> lel
[15:43:05] <Perseus0> i mean
[15:43:16] <Perseus0> the initial behaviour of the menu item
[15:43:34] <Perseus0> doesn't get back after that function
[15:44:08] <shoky> after what function.. what initial behaviour
[15:44:35] <Perseus0> so basically the behaviour of the menu item is changed during the function which makes sense but doesn't go back to its initial behaviour
[15:44:35] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[15:44:38] <Perseus0> this function http://laravel.io/bin/QNQR1
[15:45:00] <shoky> there are 3 functions here
[15:45:08] <Perseus0> you hover an area and it changes the color of the menu item
[15:45:12] <Perseus0> 2 functions
[15:45:17] <Perseus0> and both are for the same thing
[15:45:29] <jak2000> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/r0nwbn9b/9/
[15:45:50] <shoky> jak2000: ok
[15:47:04] <jak2000> have a question....
[15:47:15] <jak2000> test please, select in the first select, Bananas
[15:47:53] <jak2000> send the focus to next input, but select again bananas (same select option) and not send the focus, why?
[15:48:29] <shoky> jak2000 because it only happens on 'change' event, when the select value changes
[15:48:52] <jak2000> and how do this if not changed the value,
[15:48:55] <jak2000> ?
[15:48:58] <jak2000> is possible?
[15:49:03] <shoky> as far as i remember, there's no good cross-browser way :\
[15:49:12] <shoky> but i might be remembering wrong ;p
[15:50:20] <jak2000> ok
[15:50:37] <jak2000> other test
[15:51:01] <jak2000> go to first input write 5 and hit TAB key
[15:51:10] <jak2000> it sumarize in the div (at bottom right)?
[15:51:33] <shoky> does it do it for you?
[15:51:41] <jak2000> yes
[15:51:45] <shoky> ok
[15:51:51] <jak2000> but the select option is selected on NONE
[15:51:56] <jak2000> i want not sumarize it
[15:51:59] <shoky> ok?
[15:52:29] <jak2000> but sumarize...
[15:53:07] <jak2000> but ok,
[15:53:12] <jak2000> continue, thanks for your advice
[15:53:16] <shoky> :)
[15:56:22] <jak2000> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/r0nwbn9b/11/
[15:56:56] <shoky> jak2000: yes?
[15:58:24] <jak2000> the lines 2 to 6 of Jquery code, i want convert it into a function named SUMARIZE, how do? if you see in line 10 after select and change the focus i store a 0 in the value i want call the function SUMARIZE
[15:58:47] <shoky> that sounds like a good plan
[15:58:53] <shoky> do it :)
[15:58:58] <shoky> don't ask how.
[15:59:35] <jak2000> :( googling create a personal function with jquery :)
[15:59:43] <shoky> any place where you pass an anonymous function like    function() { ... }
[15:59:49] <shoky> you can also instead pass a named function
[15:59:53] <shoky> just the name of the function
[16:00:00] <shoky> so  if you have  .blur(function
[16:00:03] <shoky> so  if you have  .blur(function() { ... })
[16:00:09] <shoky> you can instead have  .blur(myfunctionname)
[16:00:20] <shoky> that is basic javascript, you must learn these things
[16:00:24] <jak2000> ok
[16:00:26] <jak2000> yes
[16:00:42] <jak2000> i know other programming languages same as pascal or java,
[16:00:52] <shoky> those have nothing to do with javascript :)
[16:46:40] <gwef> evening
[16:48:25] <gwef> im building an web application using google maps where it displays custom markers depending on the location in the middle of the viewpoint. if the user constantly scrolls to a new area, the RAM and CPU consumption increases significantly after a few minutes of scrolling. what can i do to release the memory once a user navigates to a different area?
[17:09:11] <adv_> how can i trigger a function when the file in an <input> field is ready?
[17:10:32] <adv_> in an upload file case
[17:30:15] <lalalaaa> Hi! Why does the CSS spinner (https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit) inserted via jQuery lose the spacing between its bars? http://jsfiddle.net/xq7hh9gq/1/
[17:46:04] <adv_> any good libraries for cropping images?
[17:46:08] <shoky> lalalaaa: probably because of the newlines in the html, being treated as whitespace, which matters for this css
[17:47:02] <shoky> lalalaaa: http://jsfiddle.net/xq7hh9gq/3/
[17:47:38] <shoky> lalalaaa: or well,  it works in your fiddle too, just there's no spaces between the boxes
[17:48:30] <lalalaaa> shoky: figured id insert the spinner via jquery when the user needs it.. as opposed to putting hundreds of spinners in the dom with display none
[17:48:56] <jak2000> i have a problem, i had this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/r0nwbn9b/11/  i select on acombobox, a element, by sample bananas, and send the cursor to next input, all is ok, but i test on a table, and hidde(or not show) the keyboard the virtual keyboard, exist a way show?
[17:49:24] <shoky> lalalaaa: that's fine, just make sure the spaces are there if you want them
[17:50:28] <lalalaaa> shoky: ah yeah good point

[17:53:17] <shoky> jak2000: are you talking about mobile?  on my android it shows the keyboard fine, fwiw
[17:53:38] <lalalaaa> wait, is there a way to make it behave similarly with or without whitespace?
[17:55:12] <jak2000> yes
[17:55:31] <jak2000> when i do the $ele.setfocus(); not show the virtual keyb
[17:56:26] <jak2000> is comun problem: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-can-i-forced-open-the-virtual-keyboard-for-a-textarea
[17:59:31] <shoky> lalalaaa: not with inline-block elements, i think.  you can try floating them instead :S

[18:11:27] <jak2000> shoky if i test with chrome. workfine(display virtual keyboard), but if i use this Internet program(defaut with samsung devivce) not work not display the virtual keyboard.
[18:21:41] <jak2000> shoky test please
[18:57:21] <shoky> jak2000 test what. i dont have your samsung device
[19:31:08] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/6wju4qe0/ i changed line 84 with line 85 . what am i doing wrong?
[19:31:26] <adv_> err 85 with 86(
[19:31:27] <adv_> *
[19:32:17] <adv_> errhttp://jsfiddle.net/6wju4qe0/1/
[19:32:19] <adv_> updated
[19:32:32] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/6wju4qe0/1/
[19:41:12] <shoky> adv_ i'm getting a CORS error about the getImageData. for this domain you can get around that using  crossorigin="anonymous"   on the <img>
[19:41:41] <shoky> (because the server response has CORS headers in it)
[19:43:10] <adv_> shoky: ah!
[19:43:31] <adv_> thanks!
[19:46:23] <adv_> shoky: why do i get this here?http://jsfiddle.net/6wju4qe0/3/
[19:46:42] <adv_> parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.
[19:47:33] <adv_> damn
[19:47:35] <adv_> sec
[19:47:38] <shoky> adv_: you can find it on ur own ;p
[19:48:16] <shoky> hint: the error message ain't lying
[19:49:33] <shoky> adv_ but it still won't work when you fix the current error, because that server doesn't respond with CORS headers
[19:50:07] <adv_> is that a problem with jsfiddle?
[19:50:24] <shoky> so you have a cross-origin issue,  like you'd have if you want to get an ajax request to a different domain
[19:51:18] <shoky> no it has nothing to do with jsfiddle. it has to do with your page being on one domain (jsfiddle's)  and the image being on a different one (sciencenutshell.com) which doesn't have CORS enabled
[19:51:27] <adv_> what i mean is am i unlucky in my domain name's choice or is it a fiddle thing
[19:51:32] <adv_> ah
[19:53:07] <adv_> i just tried with lorempixel
[19:53:17] <adv_> that always works, so something is weird
[19:54:08] <shoky> adv_: lorempixel has CORS headers enabled.
[19:54:24] <adv_> The canvas has been tainted by cross-origin data.
[19:54:28] <shoky> if you check the response headers for the image (in devtools network tab) you'll see they have the header:  Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
[19:54:44] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/6wju4qe0/8/
[19:54:54] <shoky> crossorigin="anonymous"
[19:55:13] <shoky> back where we started ;p
[19:55:15] <adv_> but i use it in other occasions without
[19:55:20] <adv_> and it works
[19:55:29] <shoky> use it in canvas getImageData ?
[19:56:07] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/6wju4qe0/9/
[19:56:09] <shoky> just having an <img> from a different domain is fine. it's loading that data into a canvas that's problematic
[19:56:09] <adv_> so not there?
[19:57:36] <adv_> shoky: how do i use it with canvas?
[19:59:09] <shoky> adv_: add a slash at the end of the img url
[19:59:42] <adv_> shoky: :D
[19:59:44] <adv_> thanks
[19:59:48] <shoky> without it there's a redirect which isnt working well with CORS, not sure exactly
[20:12:46] <adv_> shoky: can i save the canvas to a .jpg and load it programmatically ? i want to have the 2nd image (thresholded) in an <img> tag instead of canva
[20:12:47] <adv_> s
[20:19:51] <shoky> adv_: donno
[20:35:16] <adv_> argh
[20:35:18] <adv_> can't get it
