[01:01:51] <Kevv> I have a link, which I wish to intercept when clicked. I have a dialog set up, and it opens fine, but does not stop the forwarding to the link. http://pastie.org/10693078
[01:01:56] <Kevv> How do I get it to stop?
[01:02:40] <Kevv> I have tried e.preventDefault() e.stopPropagation()... it seems... unstoppable
[01:07:59] <Kevv> ANSWER ME!!
[01:08:12] <Kevv> Im sorry, Im getting kind of emotional
[01:26:54] <arup_r> Need one advice. I have a dropdown and a filter button above it. It is for searching values from list of values... now main question is should I do the search on frontend, or make Ajax call .. What is the better solution ?
[04:45:56] <i0nC4nn0n> why hello there
[04:47:12] <i0nC4nn0n> i wanna do some stuff when the user tabs on the last input of it
[04:47:16] <i0nC4nn0n> i came up with this:
[04:47:17] <i0nC4nn0n> http://pastebin.com/aQCRkKR6
[04:48:13] <i0nC4nn0n> but the issue is, he enters "foobar" in the input, presses tab and than a tab gets inserted after the text making it "foobar    " before i get the alert
[04:49:01] <i0nC4nn0n> can someone tell me what am i doing wrong here?
[04:56:09] <CMFDesign> How do you add break rows to a text function?
[04:56:24] <CMFDesign> function () {
[04:56:24] <CMFDesign>          $(".change").text("Make poor service, lack of creativity and missed deadlines a thing of the past. Talk to us and see why we’re different.");
[04:56:56] <CMFDesign> So I want to add a few lines between "past. Talk to us" I thought it was \n but that didn't work.
[04:58:18] <i0nC4nn0n>  $(".change").html("Make poor service, lack of creativity and missed deadlines a thing of the past. <br/><br/><br/> Talk to us and see why we’re different.");
[04:58:52] <CMFDesign> Nah that doesn't work. Just prints it.
[04:59:23] <CMFDesign> http://178.159.11.199/promotional-goodies/ - Its on the top box, I want to be able to hover over it and it displays different text. However, it isn't working too well. I can't do it haha
[04:59:40] <CMFDesign> But it needs to be styled, big and central etc. Not just small at the top.
[05:02:53] <i0nC4nn0n> CMFDesign, i dunno how ur doing it
[05:03:04] <i0nC4nn0n> but it inserts the tags with html entities
[05:03:29] <i0nC4nn0n> $(".change").html();
[05:03:29] <i0nC4nn0n> "Make poor service, lack of creativity and missed deadlines a thing of the past. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Talk to us and see why we’re different."
[05:04:08] <i0nC4nn0n> the string u are inserting gets "htmlentitied" so to speak
[05:04:33] <i0nC4nn0n> oh
[05:04:33] <i0nC4nn0n> nvm
[05:04:36] <i0nC4nn0n> u didn't listen to me
[05:04:38] <i0nC4nn0n> so once again
[05:04:43] <i0nC4nn0n> use .html, not .text
[05:04:53] <i0nC4nn0n> references: http://api.jquery.com/html/
[05:05:02] <i0nC4nn0n> http://api.jquery.com/text/
[05:06:54] <CMFDesign> I didn't change anything, I was in the middle of a phone call with a client.
[05:06:59] <CMFDesign> So use .html instead of .text ?
[05:08:08] <i0nC4nn0n> yaaaas :)
[05:08:21] <CMFDesign> Ok, so then how do I style this and apply it to a whole div?
[05:08:34] <CMFDesign> This is the first thing I've ever done with jquery before, so sorry if these are dumb questions.
[05:08:57] <i0nC4nn0n> u open this file in an editor: http://178.159.11.199/promotional-goodies/assets/css/main.css
[05:09:32] <CMFDesign> Ok, I understand how to edit CSS, but do I edit classes 'pass' and 'change'?
[05:10:37] <i0nC4nn0n> .change { color: red; background-color: pink;}
[05:10:39] <i0nC4nn0n> something like this
[05:11:11] <i0nC4nn0n> depends what u wanna do, lol
[05:12:17] <i0nC4nn0n> i susepect u wanna edit .inner class to have different background color on hover and on not?
[05:12:44] <CMFDesign> Yeah, and i wanted the text size of .pass and .change to be different
[05:13:00] <CMFDesign> but they seem to be inheriting each others styles.
[05:14:15] <CMFDesign> The whole div as a hover too would be great, rather than just the text.
[05:15:07] <i0nC4nn0n> $(".change").html("Make poor service, lack of creativity and missed deadlines a thing of the past. <br/> <br/> Talk to us and see why we’re different.").css("font-size", "small");
[05:15:39] <CMFDesign> That replaces the old js right?
[05:15:45] <i0nC4nn0n> yas
[05:15:49] <i0nC4nn0n> or u know
[05:15:50] <CMFDesign> Sorry I'm so new to this lol, really appreciate this help.
[05:16:03] <i0nC4nn0n> i would like make 2 different static css classes
[05:16:06] <i0nC4nn0n> and swap them around...
[05:16:23] <i0nC4nn0n> so that later u dont have to fuck around with the css with js...
[05:16:39] <CMFDesign> Ok, how would I do that?
[05:16:52] <CMFDesign> Sounds better, that way I can apply styles to each class.
[05:17:01] <i0nC4nn0n> i dunno man
[05:17:05] <i0nC4nn0n> make 2 classes
[05:17:09] <i0nC4nn0n> add styling to them
[05:17:21] <i0nC4nn0n> on hover remove text, remove class, add new class
[05:19:00] <CMFDesign> Wouldn't know how. Sorry man, thanks for getting me this far.
[05:19:05] <misterpilou> Hi everyone, is there any jquery function which can tell me if any of array element match with the one i put?
[05:19:54] <i0nC4nn0n> misterpilou, ==? :D
[05:20:23] <i0nC4nn0n> CMFDesign, i presume u can set up the 2 stylings for it in css
[05:20:37] <i0nC4nn0n> lets do it this way, leave the change as is
[05:20:43] <CMFDesign> I know how to apply css to a class yes, if thats what you're asking.
[05:20:53] <CMFDesign> so if you give me two classes, I can change them both.
[05:21:09] <CMFDesign> I'm just totally new to jquery (today)
[05:21:09] <i0nC4nn0n> but create 2 new classes to lets say "foo" and "bar"
[05:21:21] <CMFDesign> Ok, where do I create those?
[05:21:24] <i0nC4nn0n> setup the css as u like
[05:21:46] <CMFDesign> The class has to be in the html doc somewhere, right?
[05:22:30] <i0nC4nn0n> and do this on one end: $(".change").html("Make poor service, lack of creativity and missed deadlines a thing of the past. <br/> <br/> Talk to us and see why we’re different.").removeClass("foo").addClass("bar");
[05:22:53] <i0nC4nn0n> do this on the other end: $(".change").html("Promotional Goodies are specialists in the supply and distribution of branded promotional products. <br/><br>We offer a unique, personal service giving you plenty of clever ideas to enhance your marketing activity. All at a price that can’t be beaten and delivered on time!").removeClass("bar").addClass("foo");
[05:23:46] <i0nC4nn0n> not sure if my english is poor or yours or both...
[05:24:18] <i0nC4nn0n> step one: put foo and bar classes into the css file, edit them to your liking
[05:24:26] <CMFDesign> Ok, let me try that.
[05:24:41] <i0nC4nn0n> step two: edit the hover thingy as described above
[05:25:22] <i0nC4nn0n> u do know that on mobile phones u cannot hover over the elements, right? :D
[05:26:09] <i0nC4nn0n> misterpilou, say you have an array, say you have a variable u wanna itherate through the array and check each member if it matches the variable
[05:26:24] <CMFDesign> Yep, I know :)
[05:26:47] <i0nC4nn0n> misterpilou, there is this thing: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/ that does pretty nift things
[05:27:08] <i0nC4nn0n> so like
[05:27:09] <CMFDesign> i0nC4nn0n: So I've done that, I've applied some CSS to .foo and .bar, but it displays funny at the start...
[05:27:43] <i0nC4nn0n> CMFDesign, u wanna set initial value to it
[05:28:03] <i0nC4nn0n> change this: <div class="change">
[05:28:07] <i0nC4nn0n> to this: <div class="change bar">
[05:28:18] <i0nC4nn0n> also: foo and bar where examples, yo, dont use them like that
[05:28:36] <CMFDesign> I know, but it made sense lol
[05:30:13] <i0nC4nn0n> misterpilou, var array = [1, 2, 3, 4], variable = 3; $.each(array, function(index, value) { if (value===variable) alert("found it"); });
[05:30:34] <CMFDesign> i0nC4nn0n: How does that look to you now?
[05:31:20] <i0nC4nn0n> CMFDesign, professional answer: works as espected; honest answer: what are you trying to do? a windows 8 start menu? :)
[05:31:36] <CMFDesign> i0nC4nn0n: Follow a clients instructions. Fucking awful isn't it :P
[05:31:55] <CMFDesign> So, the only thing bothering me is I'd love the whole box to have the hover effect...any suggestions?
[05:32:04] <CMFDesign> Again, massively appreciate this bud. Huge help.
[05:32:06] <dimi1947> I have 2 input boxes and I want to put after the last one an element....I have tried this https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/p168vtn0/2/   but it does nothing
[05:32:50] <i0nC4nn0n> CMFDesign, my issue is, that the inner div (the "change") changes in size depending on the text it displays
[05:33:13] <i0nC4nn0n> so if i put my mouse just right it i will get a seizure
[05:33:34] <CMFDesign> Yeah, thats why I figured if the whole box is a hover, it eliminates this issue.
[05:33:42] <CMFDesign> So as soon as the mouse touches the box.
[05:36:45] <i0nC4nn0n> dimi1947, https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[05:38:09] <i0nC4nn0n> and a lot of other things...
[05:38:09] <dimi1947> i0nC4nn0n...more importantly I forgot to include jquery
[05:42:39] <dimi1947> it has functionality now but the result is not what I want
[05:42:47] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/p168vtn0/6/
[05:43:13] <i0nC4nn0n> what DO you want?
[05:44:53] <dimi1947> i0nC4nn0n...I want an element to appear below the last input element-its text included
[05:45:15] <i0nC4nn0n> below the 2nd element in this case?
[05:45:36] <i0nC4nn0n> ALWAYS below the last element, not the one that the user clicked?
[05:45:51] <i0nC4nn0n> https://jsfiddle.net/p168vtn0/9/
[05:45:53] <i0nC4nn0n> like so? :D
[05:46:56] <dimi1947> i0nC4nn0n...yes...thanks...you have a difficult to type username
[05:47:11] <i0nC4nn0n> i + 0 + tab :D
[05:47:30] <i0nC4nn0n> the i and the 0 are like right next to each other :)
[05:47:33] <Kevv> I have a link, which I wish to intercept when clicked. I have a dialog set up, and it opens fine, but does not stop the forwarding to the link. http://pastie.org/10693078
[05:47:38] <Kevv> I have tried e.preventDefault() e.stopPropagation()... it seems... unstoppable
[05:47:48] <i0nC4nn0n> also, im a l33t h4xX0r as u clearly can see :)
[05:48:24] <dimi1947> there is something else also...I forgot to mention
[05:48:45] <i0nC4nn0n> Kevv, pasie is down, use something else and relink
[05:49:18] <i0nC4nn0n> *pastie
[05:49:20] <i0nC4nn0n> dimi1947, shoot
[05:49:51] <dimi1947> I want this element to be added after the last input box only once...subsequent change events should not add the element again
[05:51:09] <Kevv> hmm, pastie is working here.. but sec
[05:51:23] <csehl> if i have two elements above eachother, can i somehow $(.theLowerOne).on('click',...? the higher one gets triggered, while the smaller inner one can't be clicked
[05:51:51] <csehl> or rather... inside of eachother. "above" in terms of z-index
[05:52:13] <Kevv> i0nC4nn0n: http://pastebin.com/4zyGcFUT
[05:52:46] <i0nC4nn0n> dimi1947, why not fancy it up: https://jsfiddle.net/p168vtn0/10/
[05:54:07] <i0nC4nn0n> csehl, u want the user to do it? thats... depending on case... if u just wanna call a click on it u can do $("#something").trigger("click");
[05:54:42] <i0nC4nn0n> Kevv, and .del-button is an a
[05:54:45] <i0nC4nn0n> that has a href set?
[05:56:56] <Kevv> i0nC4nn0n: i0nC4nn0n no...  no it is a <button> with an onclick...
[05:57:18] <Kevv> onclick="window.location='some url'
[05:57:33] <i0nC4nn0n> how did u EXACTLY use preventDefault again?
[05:58:00] <Kevv> as the first line, e.preventDefault();
[05:58:17] <Kevv> $("#objectDeleteDialog").dialog("open");
[06:01:25] <Kevv> i0nC4nn0n: making it a <a href="..."><button>....</button></a> makes it work
[06:01:48] <Kevv> thanks for the clue
[06:02:08] <i0nC4nn0n> but prevent default SHOULD prevent the onclick thing....
[06:02:31] <i0nC4nn0n> also: why do you have an onclick in the first place?
[06:02:35] <i0nC4nn0n> so many questions...
[06:02:53] <Kevv> perhaps there is a conflict with the hard coded onclick and the $('.del-button').click(function(e) { event
[06:03:16] <Kevv> but, it works, so it is a good day
[06:03:31] <i0nC4nn0n> okay than
[06:03:37] <i0nC4nn0n> tell me why my shit ain't workin'
[06:03:48] <i0nC4nn0n> http://pastebin.com/aQCRkKR6
[06:04:13] <i0nC4nn0n> oh no, wait i think i figured it out and forgot to test it :)
[06:04:13] <Uhkis> you're probably constipated
[06:04:58] <Kevv> then my work here is done

[06:07:42] <i0nC4nn0n> also: my shit started to work now that i took back 2 steps and realized im retarded
[06:08:32] <i0nC4nn0n> hey JesperA, theres a thing call'd pastebin :)
[06:09:09] <Uhkis> and  you should never use it, use jsfiddle.net
[06:09:44] <i0nC4nn0n> maybe he was pasting something else in a different room...
[06:09:45] <JesperA> ?
[06:10:02] <Ice_Strike> I am going to look for a freelance developer to work on IndexedDB, AngularJS, jQuery and Application Cache. Is this called Front-end developer I need?
[06:10:03] <JesperA> I have not pasted anything in any room :S
[06:10:05] <Uhkis> then you should probably respond there
[06:10:07] <i0nC4nn0n> * JesperA has quit (Excess Flood) <-- was just beeing a smartass regarding that
[06:10:28] <Uhkis> oh, i have joinquit spam ignored here
[06:10:44] <dimi1947> i0nC4nn0n...instead of a text I put a submit button...which I want to be removed from the DOM when no input box is checked...I tried this but it does not achieve what I want
[06:10:48] <Uhkis> Ice_Strike: yes
[06:11:05] <JesperA> i0nC4nn0n no i think it was my BNC reconnecting 4 devices at the same time which the server maybe didnt like

[06:28:07] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:28:55] <jomofcw> Do you know any uptodate flippy plugin ? I previously use this one : https://github.com/yemM/flippy but the animation seems to mess up with up to date version of jQuery and newer browser.
[06:30:26] <jomofcw> Compatible with jQuery 1.x
[06:32:04] <csehl> i0nC4nn0n: i have a <form> with an image submit button inside of a large <a><div></a>. the div is supposed to lead somewhere else, but the small <form> isn't onclick( submitted. only the outer large <div> is triggered
[06:32:53] <dimi1947> i0nC4nn0n...yes that nailed it
[06:38:50] <i0nC4nn0n> csehl, can u link me? :D
[06:40:29] <csehl> i0nC4nn0n: i'll try to fiddle a testcase in a while
[06:40:32] <i0nC4nn0n> i can't quite...grasp it
[06:40:46] <i0nC4nn0n> cool :)_
[06:43:41] <hellyeah> anyone know datapicker?
[06:44:04] <i0nC4nn0n> u mean datepicker?
[06:44:16] <hellyeah> yes
[06:44:19] <i0nC4nn0n> no :)
[06:44:21] <hellyeah> sorry about this
[06:44:24] <hellyeah> xD
[06:44:28] <i0nC4nn0n> what's ur issue?
[06:45:18] <jomofcw> Anyone there who know a version of that "https://nnattawat.github.io/flip/" compatible with jQuery 1.10.2 (this one is for jQuery 2) ?
[06:47:28] <i0nC4nn0n> jomofcw, https://github.com/yemM/flippy ?
[06:50:19] <jomofcw> i0nC4nn0n hello ^^ ! It's the old one I use, and it seems to not work really well with the latest 1.10 version of jQuery :/.
[06:53:03] <hellyeah> i0nC4nn0n: my issue is when you select dates from second input box and after creating another element i need to see those dates disabled. Example you choose 21 Jan "from" - 29 Jan "to" thing about it. When  you create second element i want to see dates disabled before 29 Jan is it possible to do that https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/22/ what do you th
[06:53:04] <hellyeah> ink?
[06:53:40] <hellyeah> hop it is understandable
[06:55:54] <i0nC4nn0n> hellyeah, i dont get it... seems to work fine in the fiddle...
[06:56:10] <hellyeah> it worked fine yes
[06:56:14] <hellyeah> let me tell you again
[06:56:29] <hellyeah> when first datepicker you select a date in second input box
[06:56:31] <hellyeah> yes
[06:57:18] <i0nC4nn0n> rephrase please, i dont understand...
[06:57:20] <hellyeah> or you select dates from inputboxes like 21 jan 29 jan
[06:57:29] <hellyeah> i am trying right
[06:57:31] <hellyeah> now
[06:57:47] <hellyeah> you select 21 jan and 29 jan from first datepicker and you click create button
[06:58:00] <hellyeah> and this create news datepickers to you right
[06:58:15] <i0nC4nn0n> yes...
[06:59:12] <i0nC4nn0n> on the second one u want the first ones disabled?
[06:59:48] <hellyeah> okey
[06:59:51] <hellyeah> i continue
[07:00:02] <csehl> i0nC4nn0n: https://jsfiddle.net/efgLqvxL/ the delete icon from google images isn't showing, but i guess you'll know what i mean...
[07:00:07] <hellyeah> in the first datepicker i want to disable 21 jan and 29 jan
[07:00:17] <hellyeah> because it is already selected dates
[07:00:21] <hellyeah> do you know how to do that
[07:00:50] <i0nC4nn0n> on the 3th u wanna disable the 1st and 2nd; on the 4th u want to disable the 1st, 2nd, 3th and so on?
[07:01:03] <hellyeah> yes
[07:01:21] <hellyeah> for example thing we have 30 datepickers
[07:01:44] <hellyeah> i choose 1-2 3-4 4-5 , 5-6 ...
[07:02:52] <hellyeah> do you understand
[07:02:53] <hellyeah> ?
[07:04:17] <hellyeah> they can choose same data in both datepickers
[07:04:26] <hellyeah> then i should disabled only one day
[07:05:01] <i0nC4nn0n> well...i would setup an array
[07:05:15] <i0nC4nn0n> store all the previous dates in them
[07:05:36] <hellyeah> hmm i did already
[07:06:14] <hellyeah> select dates and click get between dates check the console
[07:08:22] <i0nC4nn0n> i dont really get what u wanna do
[07:08:34] <i0nC4nn0n> but when u call the createANewDatepickerSection() thing
[07:08:41] <i0nC4nn0n> u wanna feed the "expired" dates to it
[07:09:08] <i0nC4nn0n> the function itself should push the new values to the "expired dates" as well
[07:09:18] <hellyeah> yeah
[07:09:26] <hellyeah> when you create new datepickers
[07:09:56] <hellyeah> i need to disable dates and dates between what was "chosen" in "from and "to"
[07:11:15] <hellyeah> you dont understand
[07:11:15] <i0nC4nn0n> 1. u set up an array for each "create" u wanna just shove them in
[07:11:18] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:11:24] <i0nC4nn0n> 2. u wanna feed that BACK to the createANewDatepickerSection()
[07:11:43] <i0nC4nn0n> so something like function createANewDatepickerSection(expired_dates) {
[07:11:49] <hellyeah> i have between array
[07:11:50] <i0nC4nn0n> and call it as such as well...
[07:12:09] <hellyeah> between array keeps the all dates
[07:12:16] <hellyeah> like you select 21 and 26
[07:12:32] <hellyeah> between array has 21,22,23,24,25,26
[07:12:44] <i0nC4nn0n> wait a sec...
[07:12:57] <hellyeah> sure
[07:17:26] <hellyeah> any particular suggestion?
[07:35:12] <rexromae> Hi guys
[07:36:36] <rexromae> what is this channel for is no one replies? lol
[07:39:06] <i0nC4nn0n> lol
[07:39:36] <i0nC4nn0n> good thing im fucking around with "hellyeah"-s datepicker and he just leaves...
[07:39:49] <Kartagis> noone here is paid to watch the IRC screen 24/7
[07:40:21] <i0nC4nn0n> Kartagis, not even ChanServ?
[07:40:42] <Kartagis> nope
[07:42:10] <i0nC4nn0n> for the record: hellyeah was using an array of array, not a... well array :) that needs to be put in the beforeShowDay's function to get checked... something like disableddates.indexOf(date) === -1 or whatever
[07:42:12] <i0nC4nn0n> and there you go...
[07:42:18] <i0nC4nn0n> rexromae, what's your issue, m8?
[07:43:35] <rexromae> I’ve just joned this channel after many years without using IRC. I think it’s a cool idea having few channels opened during coding, you can help or help someone else :)
[07:44:00] <rexromae> but, I tried saying hello in few channels, 150+ people connected, no one replied for 2 days lol
[07:44:06] <rexromae> I thought was the same here
[07:44:23] <i0nC4nn0n> i was working on someones issue
[07:44:27] <i0nC4nn0n> cause i couldn't explain it to him
[07:44:30] <i0nC4nn0n> and he left...
[07:44:40] <rexromae> :/
[07:44:47] <rexromae> where are you guys?
[07:44:54] <rexromae> I’m based in London, UK.
[07:45:00] <i0nC4nn0n> at home, drinking a beer
[07:45:53] <i0nC4nn0n> active media i see...
[07:46:08] <rexromae> nice hack :)
[07:46:15] <i0nC4nn0n> NightBookApp i see...
[07:46:24] <i0nC4nn0n> the next facebook? :D
[07:46:35] <That_Guy> Well, hi there.
[07:46:41] <That_Guy> I was on a can so...
[07:46:48] <That_Guy> Sorry
[07:46:52] <That_Guy> :)
[07:47:17] <i0nC4nn0n> That_Guy, atleast at work so u get money for the shit? :D
[07:47:26] <That_Guy> Yep
[07:47:28] <rexromae> You like to be anon instead, i0nC4nn0n
[07:47:30] <i0nC4nn0n> good job!
[07:47:57] <i0nC4nn0n> rexromae, ?
[07:48:14] <rexromae> cannot see your real name and your nickname doesn’t give anything on G
[07:48:39] <i0nC4nn0n> it does not?
[07:49:07] <rexromae> nothing meaningfull from a quick search
[07:49:36] <i0nC4nn0n> my first hit is last.fm
[07:49:37] <i0nC4nn0n> http://www.last.fm/user/i0nC4nn0n
[07:49:49] <i0nC4nn0n> so there you go, i have shitty taste in music :)
[07:50:16] <i0nC4nn0n> wow, i haven't listened to ANYTHING since newyear?!
[07:51:15] <That_Guy> How can you code without tunes?
[07:51:27] <i0nC4nn0n> issue is
[07:51:30] <i0nC4nn0n> i was using di.fm for that
[07:51:38] <i0nC4nn0n> had the icecast thingy setup in my foobar
[07:51:58] <That_Guy> Why not use Spotify?
[07:51:59] <i0nC4nn0n> but they where like "fuck you, only web player for non premium users from now on"
[07:52:06] <i0nC4nn0n> cause romania? :D
[07:52:07] <hellyeah> hey
[07:52:14] <i0nC4nn0n> LOL
[07:52:14] <That_Guy> aaa. I see
[07:52:30] <i0nC4nn0n> hellyeah, i half made it, than u exited than i got mad and close the fiddle ;)_
[07:52:33] <i0nC4nn0n> hellyeah, i half made it, than u exited than i got mad and close the fiddle ;)
[07:52:39] <i0nC4nn0n> (dammit, im used to skype, sorry)
[07:53:19] <i0nC4nn0n> That_Guy, i have an AV reciever that a spotify STICKER on it... can i play with the cool kids if i present the sticker?
[07:53:42] <That_Guy> nope
[07:53:44] <That_Guy> :)
[07:53:46] <i0nC4nn0n> :(
[07:53:54] * i0nC4nn0n throws sticker away
[07:54:05] <hellyeah> i0nC4nn0n: i am sorry
[07:54:14] <hellyeah> it must be on your history
[07:54:20] <hellyeah> can you give it to me :XD
[07:54:34] <cryptopsy> what do you prefer for generation time-plots from a flat file?
[07:55:36] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/47/43/a5/4743a5cc6dc151818643c063b5a28ace.jpg
[07:56:17] <cryptopsy> time scale plot
[07:56:34] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, u wanna make a line graph from an xml?
[07:56:43] <cryptopsy> lol
[07:57:12] <i0nC4nn0n> not gonna lie, its my 3th beer...
[07:57:15] <cryptopsy> its like talking about surgery and then you say, "uh uh, u want cut turkey in half or in slices?"
[07:57:31] <hellyeah> help
[07:57:56] <cryptopsy> http://i.imgur.com/ndFJQiZ.png
[07:58:07] <cryptopsy> here's a time gold price vs time plot
[07:58:47] <That_Guy> my favorite: http://www.highcharts.com/
[07:59:03] <cryptopsy> can it do 3d plots (multimensional) ?
[07:59:04] <That_Guy> easy to modify (fork) if something doesn't feel good for you
[07:59:11] <hellyeah> i0nC4nn0n: any chance you gave it to me?
[07:59:15] <hellyeah> give*
[07:59:54] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: what do you think of canvasXpress ?
[08:00:03] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, https://www.filamentgroup.com/dwpe/#codeexamples
[08:00:12] <i0nC4nn0n> hellyeah, im looking, but it wasn't done
[08:00:20] <i0nC4nn0n> but here's the jist of it
[08:00:44] <That_Guy> 3D plots, no. unless you use several 3D columns at once (which might crash browser)
[08:00:52] <i0nC4nn0n> you use an array of array, u just wanna use an array (the date, not the i-forgot-what-u-push-into-it)
[08:01:15] <i0nC4nn0n> check out this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30331543/disabling-specific-dates-from-html-datepicker-jquery for how to check the array
[08:01:39] <hellyeah> i0nC4nn0n: okey thanks
[08:01:50] <i0nC4nn0n> hellyeah, also: <i0nC4nn0n> for the record: hellyeah was using an array of array, not a... well array :) that needs to be put in the beforeShowDay's function to get checked... something like disableddates.indexOf(date) === -1 or whatever
[08:02:13] <That_Guy> cryptopsy, I tried it once but it didn't have what we were looking for at the time but if you want 3D, canvasXpress seems to have what you're looking for
[08:02:34] <cryptopsy> iooner: that looks like, emphasis on the word 'looks'
[08:02:34] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: that's a good point, i'm interested primarily in speed, not appearance quality
[08:02:34] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: ok here's a simple example, how about a heat map in your favorite plotting library?
[08:02:52] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: was it fast at least?
[08:03:33] * i0nC4nn0n opens up 4th beer :)
[08:04:15] <cryptopsy> don't drink more than can cripple your sanity and productivity, i drink beer too u know, i'm not a big shot. i drink when i drive though, i bet you couldn't do that.
[08:04:41] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, why are you interested in speed? how many users does it have to serve the data to?
[08:05:04] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: probably not as much as twitter but it gets updated often
[08:05:14] <That_Guy> cryptopsy: http://www.highcharts.com/demo and scroll to "Heat and tree maps". They have it covered, but this all is so relative on what your specific needs are. Some libraries deliver the parts others don't.
[08:05:16] <i0nC4nn0n> im asking cause u could do server side (for example if its some intranet thingy)
[08:05:21] <cryptopsy> and with 3 axes and 50 points per axis it become slow
[08:05:24] <i0nC4nn0n> and serve the result as an image
[08:05:28] <i0nC4nn0n> oh nvm than :)
[08:05:37] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: i could do that, well that's how the flat file is generated
[08:05:41] <hellyeah> i0nC4nn0n: i have this create element select the dates and check the console
[08:05:43] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, i cannot drink and drive... for you see i have no a. car b. license :)
[08:05:44] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/23/
[08:07:24] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, than make an image on the server in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)
[08:08:17] <That_Guy> cryptopsy, I appriciate the idea of doing "everything in background" but when it comes to graphs, you'll do better if you serve the XML to the client and let it handle the graph(ics)
[08:08:44] <i0nC4nn0n> depends on application...
[08:09:10] <csehl> what if i have two div's inside of eachother, how can i decide which .onClick() triggers?
[08:09:55] <That_Guy> I know there are always clients who want all data presented at once on one page, but they use computer, internet and world wrong and we must correct them
[08:10:16] <hellyeah> cschneid: what do you mean?
[08:10:20] <hellyeah> ops
[08:10:27] <hellyeah> csehl: what do you mean?
[08:10:52] <That_Guy> <div><div></div></div> ?
[08:11:24] <hellyeah> humm
[08:11:32] <i0nC4nn0n> That_Guy, there are specific cases tho... for example u wanna do some stock market monitoring with some bullshit embedded thingy like a digital photo frame in somewhat realtime...
[08:11:40] <hellyeah> do you everr try to use class or id
[08:11:42] <cryptopsy> can i ask jqueryui questions here?
[08:11:50] <csehl> i have a big box div which is completely <a>. inside a small button <div> with background-image, onClick( form.submit() ). When i try to click small submit <div>, big <a><div> triggers. can not submit the form
[08:12:08] <cryptopsy> im wondering how i can set the width of menu in jqueryui to always be the size of the text, but if the text is multiple words not to place each word on a different line
[08:12:09] <That_Guy> i0nC4nn0n, yep.
[08:12:14] <i0nC4nn0n> csehl, fiddle it up, yo
[08:12:26] <cryptopsy> i can do that by setting a width but then small words in submenus have wasted spaces (lot of trailing space)
[08:13:26] <That_Guy> The button is "under" the <a>. increase <a>'s z-index in css to "pop it up"
[08:13:52] <That_Guy> csehl, thet was for you :)
[08:14:01] <That_Guy> and it was just a wild guess
[08:14:44] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, count how many chars it has?
[08:14:57] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: between 30 and 5
[08:15:03] <i0nC4nn0n> no man, i mean
[08:15:04] <That_Guy> (s)he left
[08:15:13] <i0nC4nn0n> thingy.lenght
[08:15:21] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: so i have to set a max width to accomodate the 30 char menu items but then there's 25 trailing spaces after the 5 char submenu items
[08:15:23] <That_Guy> oh (s)he didn't :)
[08:15:27] <i0nC4nn0n> menuSize = someMagicNumber * thingy.lenght
[08:15:31] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: in pixels?
[08:15:41] <cryptopsy> it should be relative to each submenu's longest item
[08:15:55] <cryptopsy> so there's multiple levels of submenu, probably 10
[08:16:23] <That_Guy> 10 level sub menu???
[08:16:36] <That_Guy> 10 as in ten?
[08:16:39] <cryptopsy> yea
[08:16:49] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: its for a book
[08:17:03] <cryptopsy> actually a library of books
[08:17:11] <That_Guy> still
[08:17:44] <cryptopsy> you probably got 10 levels of folders easily somewhere on your pc
[08:17:58] <cryptopsy> good thing jqueryui supports keyboard and autocompletion
[08:18:00] <i0nC4nn0n> u want to use hexagons, thats for sure
[08:18:02] <i0nC4nn0n> cause: https://libraryofbabel.info/
[08:18:24] <i0nC4nn0n> good thing jqueryui isn't handling my 10 levels of folders on my pc...
[08:18:38] <cryptopsy> how does hexagons work?
[08:18:47] <i0nC4nn0n> check the link man
[08:18:52] <cryptopsy> i did obviously
[08:19:01] <cryptopsy> it would have bene easier to do so than to ask and have irc fight
[08:19:18] <cryptopsy> looks like some search engine, thought you were gonna show me some hexagon menu
[08:19:51] <i0nC4nn0n> oh no man, sorry, im just kidding around
[08:20:02] <cryptopsy> have no idea what im looking at
[08:20:03] <cryptopsy> http://i.imgur.com/iW3S6L3.png
[08:20:17] <cryptopsy> but it does lag
[08:20:33] <i0nC4nn0n> its a thingy
[08:20:38] <i0nC4nn0n> that generates text
[08:20:53] <That_Guy> and you can download the generated text :)
[08:20:59] <That_Guy> how adorable is that
[08:21:00] <i0nC4nn0n> but the thing is
[08:21:04] <i0nC4nn0n> 1. it isn't stored
[08:21:10] <i0nC4nn0n> 2. it ALWAYS generates the same stuff
[08:21:32] <cryptopsy> probably because it doesn't use a random seed, why is that something impressive?
[08:22:10] <i0nC4nn0n> hard to explain
[08:22:14] <That_Guy> https://libraryofbabel.info/theory.html
[08:22:19] <i0nC4nn0n> since 1. im drunk 2. not my motherlanguage
[08:22:20] <That_Guy> that explains... a bit
[08:22:30] <i0nC4nn0n> but i can link a video if u like...
[08:22:44] <cryptopsy> stop using alcohol as a crutch for stupidity, its not classy
[08:22:48] * That_Guy is a bit afraid now
[08:23:05] <cryptopsy> if you wanna look cool you have to be able to do the tricks without suffering loss in efficiency and skill
[08:23:12] <cryptopsy> you know? like james bond

[08:24:07] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, to quote mitch headberg, im not using alcohol as a crutch, for you see a crutch HELPS me walk...
[08:24:31] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, lemme guess, ur single?
[08:25:38] <cryptopsy> mitch HEADburg?
[08:26:28] <hellyeah> i0nC4nn0n: little bit help :X
[08:26:33] <i0nC4nn0n> berg, burg, potato, tomato ;)
[08:26:49] <i0nC4nn0n> but, yes i ment headburg
[08:28:11] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, but answer the question at hand :)
[08:29:01] <cryptopsy> anyways, nowadays laptops are comming with pixel densities you find on phones, so you can have a 13" laptop with 3200x1800 resolution. All previously barely-non-lagging js libs are now gonna lag
[08:29:18] <cryptopsy> even if the browser is shrunken it will lag
[08:30:23] <csehl> i0nC4nn0n: https://jsfiddle.net/efgLqvxL/3/
[08:31:12] <That_Guy> cryptopsy, but the power to draw graphs on those pixels has increased too
[08:31:32] <cryptopsy> csehl: is this what im supposed to be seeing? i'm asking because qtwebkit is nubile and doesn't seem to perform all modern functions. http://i.imgur.com/nvpEsGd.png
[08:31:39] <hellyeah> no one is helping me  :x/
[08:31:58] <That_Guy> but yeah, you can knock down a browser or give a computer a heart attack with graph if you want :)
[08:32:11] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: not by much. My bleeding edge x1 carbon is maybe only 50% faster than a core2duo from 8 years ago
[08:32:42] <csehl> cryptopsy: not really, i get something else. or do you mean onClick?
[08:32:58] <cryptopsy> csehl: i mean just on load, i dont know where to click to see the interpreted code
[08:33:13] <csehl> cryptopsy: no yeah, that seems to be displayed wrong
[08:33:18] <cryptopsy> thanks
[08:33:33] <cryptopsy> it was supposed to display in the bottom right box
[08:33:58] <csehl> i just get a tiny gray box with a link inside of it
[08:34:25] <That_Guy> cryptopsy, I could say "don't buy crap" ;) most people who need to view heavy charts on their computers, have computers that can manage that. But I see your point and agree with it. The client shouldn't have to do the dirty work.
[08:34:29] <cryptopsy> that's sad, jsfiddle is rather popular
[08:34:29] <i0nC4nn0n> csehl, https://jsfiddle.net/efgLqvxL/4/
[08:34:49] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: its the only laptop on planet earth with a trackpoint and over 1920x1080 resolution
[08:35:47] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, get a laptop with a shitty keyboard/touchpad but the screen u desire
[08:35:48] <cryptopsy> the trackpoint is rather cpu intensive, when my northbridge fan/pipe broke on my t61 it was enough to overheat the cpu to the point of shutting down
[08:35:48] <That_Guy> aaa. you like trackpoint too
[08:36:00] <i0nC4nn0n> get a tex yoda :)
[08:36:05] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: touchpad is not efficient and not ergonomic
[08:36:15] <cryptopsy> i don't want to be incapacitated like RMS, JWZ and other programmers
[08:36:30] <cryptopsy> i write books on my computer 12 hour a day, i will surely be fried in 10 years, and i've already been around for 9
[08:37:15] <i0nC4nn0n> as i said.... get an ergonomical peripherial for the shitty laptop and ur done...
[08:37:47] <csehl> i0nC4nn0n: oh, that also prevents the other elements default. alright, thanks!
[08:37:58] <i0nC4nn0n> ofc it does...
[08:38:11] <That_Guy> cryptopsy, I use a laptop but I also have an external keyboard, mouse and screen. That's not an option for you?
[08:38:27] <i0nC4nn0n> same setup for me...
[08:39:56] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: nah
[08:40:01] <That_Guy> :)
[08:40:10] <cryptopsy> it seems impractical
[08:40:23] <cryptopsy> cannot program in bed
[08:40:34] <cryptopsy> maybe if i have a chair comfortable enough to sit in 12hour a day without geting back pains
[08:40:38] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, u sure u checked what i said earlyer, here are some images: https://www.google.ro/search?q=tex+yoda&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijvoCivrPKAhVGkywKHZs9B9EQ_AUIBygB&biw=1920&bih=979
[08:40:50] <That_Guy> you would still have the laptop. take that to the bed with you
[08:41:09] <cryptopsy> if i'm going to spend half my time in bed there's no point
[08:41:15] <slax0r> trackpad/touchpad same thing...
[08:41:20] <slax0r> mouse pointer is overrated
[08:41:21] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: i know about those keyboards, but the laptop keyboards have shorter keystroke, which is why i prefer them
[08:41:22] <i0nC4nn0n> ur already spending 1/3 of your time there :)
[08:41:37] <cryptopsy> i can type 200wpm on a laptop keyboard if you exclude modifier keys
[08:41:54] <cryptopsy> cannot on desktop keyboard, the stroke is too long. i know it can be done but its harder
[08:42:14] <i0nC4nn0n> i dont really wanna sound arrogant, but are you SURE u type with 200wpm and u DISLIKE mechanical switches?
[08:42:15] <cryptopsy> the laptop keeps the keyboard in the right position relative to the screen at all times. So when you're in bed its always there
[08:42:15] <slax0r> laptop keyboards are like, the worst keyboards, ever
[08:42:19] <That_Guy> cryptopsy, itäs not really the chair that pains your back. You should train your back to avoid that (just saying 'cause it's related to my work:))
[08:42:36] <That_Guy> *itäs = it's
[08:42:45] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: yes, even though i am a stronger believe in anything xahlee says, and he has written maybe 200articles on keyboard ergonomics and does not agree with what i just said
[08:43:15] <cryptopsy> That_Guy: that's true too, but i haven't gotten the hand of posture exercises. If i keep my lumbar spine straight my cervical spine has to bend over more to see the screen.
[08:43:24] <i0nC4nn0n> have you tried one or two or twotousand?
[08:43:27] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: strong, not stronger
[08:43:30] <i0nC4nn0n> they are different switches you know...
[08:43:39] <cryptopsy> they all have long keystroke
[08:44:01] <cryptopsy> i like feeling a strong surface on the bottom, not hitting into void. Because if the key doesn't hit a solid surface im not sure if i hit the key strong enough
[08:44:07] <slax0r> you are the first one I heard who prefers zero-feedback laptop keyboard over mechanical switches...
[08:44:10] <i0nC4nn0n> but u do know that u dont HAVE to bottom them out, right?
[08:44:18] <slax0r> I kinda doubt your other claims now too
[08:44:30] <cryptopsy> that's fine, this is web design channel
[08:44:31] <slax0r> and, you lie in bed while working, very efficient I presume
[08:44:45] <slax0r> i0nC4nn0n: that depends on the switch
[08:44:47] <i0nC4nn0n> u do know that... there are clicky ones as well, right?
[08:44:55] <cryptopsy> slax0r: now that's jumping the gun, you can't prove that
[08:45:03] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: but they're long keystroke too
[08:45:08] <slax0r> cryptopsy: what is?
[08:45:16] <cryptopsy> slax0r: to claim that its not efficient working in bed
[08:45:19] <i0nC4nn0n> cherry is actuated at like 50%
[08:45:24] <slax0r> cryptopsy: I've tried it...
[08:45:31] <cryptopsy> slax0r: but you're generalizing
[08:45:33] <i0nC4nn0n> alps at like 70%
[08:45:38] <slax0r> I am much happier working on a desktop, which I can not drag to my bed
[08:45:44] <slax0r> and try to "work" there
[08:45:47] <i0nC4nn0n> if you hit a hard surface while typing... ur doing something wrong...
[08:45:48] <cryptopsy> you don't think i can work more efficiently if i was straight typing ideas from my head in the comfort of my bed than if i was at a desk in pain ?
[08:46:12] <i0nC4nn0n> i flatout dont belive you, lets do a typerace! :D
[08:46:20] <slax0r> ^
[08:46:28] <cryptopsy> don't mix preference with fact. i was clear from the start to state my ideas about laptops are preference, but about trackpoint is a fact. That's because moving the hand from the keyboard is ineficient in the same way moving the pinky to hit escpae key is ineficient
[08:46:35] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: ok lets do it
[08:46:40] <i0nC4nn0n> i cannot belive that someone can type with 200wpm from a laptop
[08:46:40] <cryptopsy> typerracer.com
[08:46:45] <slax0r> well, if you are in a pain while sitting you either have a shitty chair, or are not sitting right, or both
[08:47:02] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: i will probably hit 200wpm or close to it in a lowercase without symbols race
[08:47:13] <slax0r> I agree on moving hand away from keyboard is ineficient
[08:47:18] <slax0r> that's why I hardly use the mouse
[08:47:19] <slax0r> ever
[08:47:25] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: lets do a type race i love this
[08:47:42] <That_Guy> :D
[08:47:46] <cryptopsy> sean wrona, the creator of typeracer can type over 220wpm on random string, like :$:!>:XA>V>VV!)F
[08:47:56] <That_Guy> this must be fun
[08:48:19] <cryptopsy> if i don't make a mistake i will surely hit 200wpm , that's because a single mistake can set you back like 40wpm
[08:48:30] <cryptopsy> well its logarithmic, multiple mistake will not set you to like 1wpm
[08:48:40] <cryptopsy> i'm talking about when you're close to a high number
[08:48:46] <i0nC4nn0n> im too drunk to figure out how to challange someone, do it, cryptopsy :)
[08:48:52] <cryptopsy> i've done it before
[08:49:26] <cryptopsy> anyways my point was that laptops have gotten slower since screen resolution has increaesd, despite CPU getting faster
[08:49:30] <i0nC4nn0n> http://play.typeracer.com/?rt=ncxqkc50g29c
[08:49:31] <i0nC4nn0n> there we go
[08:49:48] <cryptopsy> a couple races then im back to work
[08:50:01] <arc_> typing at some speed on a test does not mean you type that fast all the time or even frequently
[08:50:11] <cryptopsy> arc_: that's true but its very similar
[08:50:17] <arc_> but i also dislike mechanical keys
[08:50:36] <arc_> i prefer the apple keyboard which has scissor switches
[08:51:25] <i0nC4nn0n> 89 is not 200...
[08:51:30] <That_Guy> 35 wpm in English which isn't my mothertounge :)
[08:52:05] <i0nC4nn0n> isn't mine or cryptopsy's either from what i gathered...
[08:52:09] <cryptopsy> at the end of a 100wpm it makes you type a paragraph from photographed book
[08:52:15] <cryptopsy> it permits mistake ill show you screenshot
[08:52:20] <cryptopsy> with like 95% accuracy
[08:52:31] <cryptopsy> otherwise we'll be here a few races till i can nail one without mistakes
[08:52:52] <cryptopsy> join the race so i can type this one
[08:52:52] <i0nC4nn0n> prefers scrissor switch
[08:53:00] <i0nC4nn0n> 200wpm
[08:53:02] <i0nC4nn0n> chose one...
[08:53:18] <cryptopsy> whatever dude, find me a typeracer that tolerates mistakes and set a accuracy tolerance
[08:53:24] <i0nC4nn0n> i left, i called bullshit, was proven right, end of discussion :)
[08:53:29] <cryptopsy> i'm reading while im typing, typing from your head is faster
[08:53:36] <cryptopsy> k i'm out too
[08:53:43] <cryptopsy> since no one's joining
[08:53:44] <arc_> that is definitely true
[08:54:03] <arc_> does this site not have a top scores of all time list or what
[08:54:06] <cryptopsy> do a few more races, it gives you an error tolerant test for every 100wpm non-registered race
[08:54:07] <arc_> that seems like a ridiculous oversight
[08:54:13] <cryptopsy> arc_: it does
[08:54:33] <i0nC4nn0n> bro like... u cannot type with 200wpm...
[08:54:37] <i0nC4nn0n> consistently
[08:54:39] <i0nC4nn0n> and without errors
[08:54:42] <That_Guy> It was a snowy and dark afternoon. Perfect for winter sports. Instead of going out to play and ski, the nerds had a typing duel.
[08:54:44] <That_Guy> :)
[08:54:46] <i0nC4nn0n> u saw i barely managed 70
[08:54:50] <cryptopsy> http://i.imgur.com/KnQ5UqI.png
[08:54:52] <i0nC4nn0n> and i have TWO backspace keys...
[08:54:55] <arc_> some of these people are using macros
[08:55:00] <arc_> for sure
[08:55:12] <arc_> that says latest high scores, not all time
[08:55:18] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: what are you saying, i can't hit even 150 with errors?
[08:55:21] <cryptopsy> 70 is half that
[08:55:24] <i0nC4nn0n> should i set a highscore?
[08:55:40] <i0nC4nn0n> cause i do have macros...
[08:55:48] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: if you type the same speed in one race, but in another with the same speed you make 1 error, that will be a difference of like 40wpm
[08:56:08] <mr_pinc> Grettings - I've got an issue with jquery mobile radiobuttons.  When I launch my app and select a radio button it works fine - becomes selected.  if I select a text field somewhere else in the app (which brings up the keyboard) then I choose one of those radiobuttons the keyboard pops up again which it shouldn't.  This is in a cordova app.  Anyone have an idea on what might be going on?
[08:56:11] <i0nC4nn0n> cryptopsy, i call bullshit on your maths as well, i challange you to a math race as well!
[08:56:14] <cryptopsy> search sean wrona on youtube if you wanna see the top scoring guy in action
[08:56:29] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: want to do a few more races?
[08:56:37] <cryptopsy> i have what it takes to get you to take your panties off
[08:56:46] <arc_> facepalm
[08:56:49] <arc_> i think this has gone far enough
[08:56:57] * i0nC4nn0n takes off panties
[08:57:10] <cryptopsy> sean wrona is a data entry clerk
[08:57:12] * i0nC4nn0n does the basic insting leg switch thing
[08:57:28] <cryptopsy> he took all the scores from nascar and put them in a database
[08:57:31] * That_Guy tries not to laugh
[08:57:39] <cryptopsy> that's basically what im doing except taking ideas from my head and putting them in words
[08:58:05] <i0nC4nn0n> so like the random library generator i linked earlyer only more rendundant? :D
[08:58:13] <cryptopsy> about to do a race 1 sec
[08:59:05] <cryptopsy> last race, my browser wasn't even in insert mode when i started typing
[08:59:06] <slax0r> so, did we get to the magical 200wpm?
[08:59:12] <i0nC4nn0n> slax0r, 89
[08:59:14] <cryptopsy> ill come back some day with it
[08:59:20] <i0nC4nn0n> i was second with 71
[08:59:31] <slax0r> but you said you can comfortably lie in your bed and write with 200wpm constantly
[08:59:31] <i0nC4nn0n> (i blame the beers)
[08:59:35] <CarlosEduardo> hello guys
[08:59:40] <slax0r> and now you can't break even 100?
[08:59:50] <mouse> none of the devices i own have good keyboards, rmbp, imac, chromebook
[08:59:50] <CarlosEduardo> does anyone know how to do this trick, upload movies on google drive  -> https://3.bp.blogspot.com/7m_w-zeswJ6qe8gKrFhh2hhvJ4tZhSsmuWMv_fOI1e0=m22
[09:00:01] <cryptopsy> i just did http://i.imgur.com/MzqS7v9.png
[09:00:06] <i0nC4nn0n> mouse, hey, atleast your a mouse!
[09:00:11] <mouse> but i'm a mouse :D
[09:00:17] <cryptopsy> look im going to do the book page typing test with over 200
[09:00:38] <mouse> i can get about 120-130 though. Thanks Mavis Beacon.
[09:00:40] <i0nC4nn0n> but like
[09:00:45] <i0nC4nn0n> my keyboard is blank and stuff
[09:00:47] <i0nC4nn0n> and im drunk
[09:00:57] <i0nC4nn0n> doesn't that like mean im better? :D
[09:01:04] <mouse> hash tag winning
[09:01:19] <arc_> some of the samples are much more difficult than others
[09:01:32] <i0nC4nn0n> that is irrelevant
[09:01:39] <arc_> why...?
[09:01:40] <i0nC4nn0n> by 120 i would have been impressed...
[09:01:52] <i0nC4nn0n> but 89...and claiming 200?
[09:02:08] <arc_> shit happens, bud
[09:02:20] <i0nC4nn0n> i know a dude who can do 120 consistently
[09:02:26] <i0nC4nn0n> hell i bet a lot of you here can do as well
[09:02:30] <arc_> yes
[09:02:38] <cryptopsy> heres 161 with some errors http://i.imgur.com/17PrtjQ.png
[09:02:44] <slax0r> I call total BS that you hit 200wpm consistently on a laptop keyboard
[09:02:47] <i0nC4nn0n> but 200 is kinda high for someone who doens't kwno thw first thing about keyboard switches...
[09:02:50] <slax0r> that thing has close to no feedback
[09:02:59] <slax0r> you can't type that fast without having some feedback
[09:03:04] <cryptopsy> slax0r: ill film it someday with my phoen or something
[09:03:09] <slax0r> unless you hit only 200wpm when you get lucky and make no mistakes
[09:03:18] <cryptopsy> give me your contact info
[09:03:20] <cryptopsy> i need it for my website
[09:03:26] <cryptopsy> email or link to your site
[09:03:27] <slax0r> wut?
[09:03:28] <arc_> saying we don't know about keyboard switches because we prefer scissor switches is flawed logic
[09:03:37] <cryptopsy> slax0r: im going to take your channel and i need it for my keyboard articles
[09:03:40] <cryptopsy> challenge
[09:04:10] <slax0r> cryptopsy: I'll PM you
[09:04:12] <cryptopsy> or github repo link or whatever
[09:04:14] <slax0r> arc_: I never said that
[09:04:35] <arc_> i am aware...
[09:04:46] <cryptopsy> i have an exam in like a day but im gonna screenshot and get back to you on that challenge eventually
[09:04:55] <slax0r> anyhoo
[09:04:57] <slax0r> break time
[09:05:00] <slax0r> ttyl
[09:05:01] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, your preference is one thing, but the fact that u want to bottom out cherry switches and think they are slower cause u ALWAYS bottom them out is another...
[09:05:13] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, i mean cryptopsy by that, not you
[09:05:26] <arc_> here is a test from a few years ago where i got 160 wpm with 100% accuracy on an apple keyboard http://porath.org/i/screenie/typing_test_lolz.png
[09:05:38] <arc_> it's not impossible to type fast on an "inferior" keyboard
[09:05:44] <i0nC4nn0n> what apple keyboard was that?
[09:05:45] <arc_> you just have to get used to it
[09:05:55] <arc_> the one that is called apple wired keyboard
[09:06:00] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: i want bottom out and short keystroke
[09:06:13] <cryptopsy> if it doesnt bottom out you cant say it has a short stroke just because it engages a signal early
[09:06:22] <i0nC4nn0n> oh, i tought it was a vintage one with alps switches...
[09:06:23] <cryptopsy> when you bounce a basketball you smash it on the solid ground
[09:06:33] <arc_> nope, scissor switches
[09:06:50] <cryptopsy> the feedback is the bottoming out, what's your problem against scissor?
[09:06:52] <slax0r> arc_: no one is claiming that you can't type fast, but those keyboards have no feedback, meaning, your fingers don't detect that you made a mistake, so you have to wait for your laggy eyes to spot the mistake, if they even do, so if you are always typing perfectly, you will be just as fast, no argument there, but if you're a lousy typer and make mistakes all over the place, you will detect them better on a mechanical switch
[09:07:14] <cryptopsy> slax0r: i make sure to hit the bottom to know if my keys engaged
[09:07:16] <arc_> i don't understand that claim
[09:07:29] <arc_> how does a mechanical keyboard make it easier for me to realize that i typed the wrong key without looking
[09:07:33] <arc_> i can tell that already
[09:07:33] <slax0r> cryptopsy: and no, bottoming out is not keyboard, that's why mechanical switches have clicks, and bumps
[09:07:46] <cryptopsy> your eyes are always used for catching mistakes because if you have off-by-one error you have to align the cursor to fix it
[09:07:50] <slax0r> but now really, break
[09:08:25] <cryptopsy> its easy to bounce a fist on a wall but in the air if your arm wants to change direction it has to decellerate and that's slow
[09:08:35] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, there are different kind of switches
[09:08:39] <arc_> i know that
[09:08:44] <i0nC4nn0n> there are bumpy ones, clicky ones, etc...
[09:08:44] <cryptopsy> that's why you want to hit a solid surface, a weak click isn't going to do that
[09:08:54] <i0nC4nn0n> (just talking of the cherry mx family here for a bit)
[09:09:03] <arc_> cryptopsy you don't have to bottom out at all. when you get used to it you can type without bottoming out
[09:09:09] <i0nC4nn0n> u KNOW it is actuated if u hear or feel it
[09:09:13] <cryptopsy> anyways the real problem with laptop keyboards isnt the scissors, its that they're flat and that's not very ergonomic
[09:09:29] <arc_> i0nC4nn0n yes
[09:09:31] <cryptopsy> but it comes with trackpoint so i sacrifice a bit of health for inceased efficiency
[09:09:48] <i0nC4nn0n> there are other types, where u cant feel or hear shit (linear, for example cherry mx black)
[09:09:57] <i0nC4nn0n> but they all actuate at the mid point
[09:09:58] <arc_> i know this
[09:10:04] <i0nC4nn0n> so my point is
[09:10:05] <cryptopsy> arc_: i've used mechanical keyboard for years, including the IBM's, i can never predict the click zone
[09:10:10] <i0nC4nn0n> what is better for your fingertips
[09:10:22] <cryptopsy> not accurately anways, so its better just to hit a little harder to ensure i always bottom out. And i get the bound at the bottom.
[09:10:25] <i0nC4nn0n> bashing it against the surface or letting it rest on a spring
[09:10:33] <cryptopsy> powerlifters use the same technique when they want to benchpress heavy weight
[09:10:38] <arc_> that seems like a bit of overoptimization
[09:10:47] <cryptopsy> your spine as interneurons and you're taking advange of this reflex
[09:10:48] <i0nC4nn0n> meaning its a bit... harder for me on a scrissor
[09:10:54] <i0nC4nn0n> cause when i type a fucktonne on it
[09:10:55] <arc_> i don't press the keys hard
[09:11:00] <i0nC4nn0n> my hands hurt
[09:11:03] <i0nC4nn0n> but
[09:11:03] <cryptopsy> has anyone studied physiology? i went through medschool
[09:11:08] <arc_> yeah i have definitely never had that problem
[09:11:28] <i0nC4nn0n> if soneone is claiming he can type with 200wpm all day for 12 hours on a scrissor switch
[09:11:45] <i0nC4nn0n> he is either bullshiting or really in desperate need of a better keyboard...
[09:11:54] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: no one claimed that
[09:12:04] <cryptopsy> look i have to scratch my ass like every 5 minutes how is that even possible
[09:12:12] <i0nC4nn0n> :)
[09:12:14] <cryptopsy> now you're just being absurd to solidify your claim against me
[09:12:16] <arc_> i think the whole idea that mechanical switches are inherently better for typing is a misconception
[09:12:33] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, elaborate
[09:12:40] <arc_> people have all kinds of ideas, like that dvorak is inherently better which is also nonsense
[09:12:41] <cryptopsy> i can type small paragraph in 200wpm, that means i could type a page in 130, and that's very good
[09:12:58] <cryptopsy> that excludes modified keys
[09:12:59] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, colemak is inheritly better
[09:13:31] <cryptopsy> arc_: dvorak is based on statistical analysis of keys. its better but i cannot adopt it. got no time
[09:13:46] <cryptopsy> so it depends what keys you use most frequently , the answer to the question
[09:13:54] <cryptopsy> if you're data entry clerk and use numbers a lot, dvorak will not be better
[09:14:00] <cryptopsy> because the numbers are not on the home row
[09:14:16] <cryptopsy> i think dvorak makes suggestion for the numpad though
[09:14:23] <i0nC4nn0n> if ur a data entry clerk and u use the alphanumeric numbers i feel sorry for you :)
[09:14:30] <i0nC4nn0n> it does not
[09:14:43] <cryptopsy> check xahlee's site
[09:15:05] <cryptopsy> he likes mechanical keys a lot and has 200articles on the subject
[09:15:18] <i0nC4nn0n> went to the site
[09:15:19] <cryptopsy> xahlee.info/comp/dvorak_keyboard_layout.html?
[09:15:25] <i0nC4nn0n> saw some weaboo bullshit
[09:15:28] <i0nC4nn0n> immediately closed it
[09:15:31] <arc_> rolleyes
[09:15:59] <cryptopsy> dvorak-querty heatmap: http://i.imgur.com/00vEl6L.png
[09:16:13] <cryptopsy> this is why dvorak is better, they put the harder to reach keys on the most comfortable row (home row)
[09:16:25] <i0nC4nn0n> guys why are we haveing a discussion over the layout?
[09:16:28] <cryptopsy> but in general you have to adopt dovrak and that takes months to regain your speed
[09:16:33] <i0nC4nn0n> i use a nonstandard one, noone friggin cares, etc
[09:16:38] <cryptopsy> when people say dvorak is better they're referring to the long term benefit
[09:16:49] <cryptopsy> i don't use dvorak i can't afford to cripple my speed for 6 month
[09:16:55] <i0nC4nn0n> what i wanna know is why arc_ says that mechanical keyboards are not inheritly better for typing
[09:17:04] <i0nC4nn0n> your speed of 200? :D
[09:17:12] <arc_> because all you have to do is get used to whatever you're typing on
[09:17:22] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: even if it was 100, it would reduce to 20wpm for at least 2 month
[09:17:24] <arc_> if you know what your fingers have to do to actuate the keys, it makes no difference what the actuation actually is
[09:17:40] <arc_> as long as it isn't inconsistent like some garbage $8 keyboard
[09:17:52] <cryptopsy> arc_ is correct
[09:18:00] <cryptopsy> peace out for now
[09:18:50] <i0nC4nn0n> for the average dude
[09:18:59] <arc_> i fully understand the advantages of mechanical keyboards, but if i switch to one right now, it will slow me down significantly. i'm not used to it
[09:19:09] <arc_> i can get used to it over time, but i will not increase my top speed just because i switched my keyboard
[09:19:14] <i0nC4nn0n> a keyboard that doesn't bottom out (as in hits the fucking plate)
[09:19:37] <cryptopsy> bottom out is not only an acceptable signal that you hit the right key but you get the bounce reflex
[09:19:42] <i0nC4nn0n> i think is better...
[09:19:50] <arc_> why?
[09:19:51] <cryptopsy> so your energey is not fully wasted reversing the direction of the finger
[09:20:06] <cryptopsy> powerlifters do it in benchpress , bodybuilders
[09:20:07] <arc_> pressing keys so hard that your fingers bounce back doesn't seem like the best idea...
[09:20:12] <arc_> but i guess to each his own
[09:20:26] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, i dunno man, its hard to explain
[09:20:28] <i0nC4nn0n> but give it a try...
[09:20:34] <cryptopsy> i only have to move my fingers slightly harder than is enough to generate a signal and i recuperate any extra energy from the bounce
[09:20:37] <arc_> believe me i have tried mechanical keyboards on many occasions
[09:20:42] <i0nC4nn0n> why do you think it would slow u down compared to a scrissor switch?
[09:20:48] <cryptopsy> the harder you hit the faster it bounces back up so its not totally wasted energy
[09:20:49] <arc_> like i said, i'm not used to it
[09:20:51] <suexec> Sorry about stupid question. It's late and my brain is fried. Underscores are OK to use in div ids, right?
[09:21:00] <slax0r> i0nC4nn0n: changing keyboards _will_ slow you down, at first
[09:21:00] <arc_> suexec yes
[09:21:06] <i0nC4nn0n> if its not the first char...
[09:21:13] <cryptopsy> slax0r: yup
[09:21:16] <cryptopsy> true
[09:21:26] <slax0r> if you take a keyboard that has the keys just slightly in a different position, will make you type with more mistakes
[09:21:29] <slax0r> until you get used to it
[09:21:32] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, what did u try out, and more to the point: for HOW LONG?
[09:21:34] <suexec> arc_, and it won't mess up things with jquery when I use i.e $("#my_div").click ... ?
[09:21:35] <slax0r> regardless of switches
[09:21:49] <arc_> suexec no, that's fine
[09:22:01] <suexec> Sweet :)
[09:22:02] <cryptopsy> this is a good conversation i wish i had time to blog abou tit
[09:22:26] <i0nC4nn0n> slax0r, check me out, yo: http://qlr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150703_125953.jpg
[09:22:37] <arc_> i0nC4nn0n i don't really feel like writing out my full journey of mechanical keyboard switches ... but suffice it to say that i was an enthusiast for a while when i thought it would actually make a difference, due to buying into the hype
[09:22:49] <arc_> i always ended up going back to the apple keyboard
[09:22:51] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: xahlee likes the bottom keyboard
[09:22:54] <arc_> which i've had for like 8 years now
[09:23:01] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: because more buttons is better
[09:23:09] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, are there any leftovers? do you live close to romania? wanna sell some stuff? :D
[09:23:13] <cryptopsy> if you submit to his site he will mention you
[09:23:21] <arc_> no, sorry. i returned everything
[09:23:30] <slax0r> i0nC4nn0n: not sure what I am supposed to check out in that blurry image
[09:24:02] <i0nC4nn0n> slax0r, "if you take a keyboard that has the keys just slightly in a different position, will make you type with more mistakes"
[09:24:21] <slax0r> and that image is supposed to counter that argument?
[09:24:34] <cryptopsy> i think hes refering like changing the key and corresponding letter, not slightly angling the keys on one side like an ergonomic keyboard
[09:24:40] <arc_> i don't like that typematrix stuff. your hands aren't shaped like squares. when you move your fingers they don't move perpendicular to your body. it's on an angle, which is why keyboards were designed like that to begin with
[09:24:49] <cryptopsy> arc_: that's a good fucking point, i agree
[09:25:02] <cryptopsy> but you get more keys, and that means less ALT- combos
[09:25:04] <i0nC4nn0n> i mean that the bottom one is a matrix keyboard, and the rows arent shifted to the left by one bit
[09:25:09] <i0nC4nn0n> it's a bitch to get used to...
[09:25:20] <cryptopsy> i0nC4nn0n: its also not ergonomic
[09:25:25] <slax0r> and while you are getting used to it, you will type slower

[09:25:57] <cryptopsy> on their site, they talk about staggered vs inline keys
[09:26:07] <cryptopsy> inline is good but the problem is theyr'e not angled
[09:26:42] <cryptopsy> here's diagram of the truly ergo keyboard, its like typematrix but angled; http://i.imgur.com/TYOpJYC.png
[09:26:50] <arc_> yeah, i guess if they made one that was angled and inline it would have more potential
[09:27:07] <cryptopsy> anyways that's a problem with laptop keyboard
[09:27:13] <arc_> but the problem then becomes how much desk space it takes up
[09:27:13] <i0nC4nn0n> unless u need to move to someone elses computer and (s)he has a regular one...
[09:27:20] <cryptopsy> so don't talk shit about my scissor keys when you're using the same fucked up matrix layout
[09:27:44] <i0nC4nn0n> who? :D
[09:27:51] <cryptopsy> your typematrix keyboard
[09:28:00] <cryptopsy> has got same problem as laptop keyboard
[09:28:10] <i0nC4nn0n> brah, it has cherry mx blacks with diodes on each switch
[09:28:26] <cryptopsy> kek
[09:28:28] <i0nC4nn0n> its like comparing a goat to a mouse
[09:28:29] <cryptopsy> peace
[09:28:37] <cryptopsy> yea but goat and mouse both don't know rocket science
[09:28:37] <i0nC4nn0n> neither can fly...
[09:28:52] <cryptopsy> and neither put your wrists back together after 20 years of abuse typing on shitty keyboard
[09:29:27] <i0nC4nn0n> i just tryied out the matirx...
[09:29:31] <i0nC4nn0n> wasn't really for me
[09:29:39] <i0nC4nn0n> i use the top one as a daily driver (typing on it right now)
[09:30:17] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, do you game at all?
[09:30:25] <i0nC4nn0n> i belive that is the issue here
[09:30:32] <i0nC4nn0n> u didn't have to hold W for 2 hours in a row...
[09:30:47] <arc_> huh? yes i do
[09:31:07] <arc_> the amount of force required to hold down a key on my keyboard is miniscule
[09:31:16] <arc_> it barely feels like i'm pressing anything
[09:31:34] <i0nC4nn0n> well, if u already tried it
[09:31:41] <i0nC4nn0n> and had a long journey and whatnot that u dont wanna talk about it
[09:31:52] <i0nC4nn0n> i guess a random fag from the internet (it rhymes) won't change ur mind
[09:32:20] <MajorTennis> for some reason my autocomplete isnt working using the jquery-ui
[09:32:47] <slax0r> why try to change someones mind? use whatever floats your boat ;)
[09:32:51] <MajorTennis> is there a limit to how many values it can have as this array is much larger than those ive used before?
[09:33:28] <i0nC4nn0n> slax0r, cause im a rebel!
[09:33:38] <i0nC4nn0n> and by rebel i mean everyone should use what i use
[09:33:50] <MajorTennis> I get this 	
[09:33:50] <MajorTennis> return matcher.test( value.label || value.value || value );
[09:33:50] <i0nC4nn0n> so by rebel i apparently mean the exact opposite of a rebel...
[09:34:00] <MajorTennis> value is undefined :(
[09:34:03] <slax0r> i0nC4nn0n: I will probably never use the same editor as you do :P
[09:34:09] <MajorTennis> but im console .logging the array the values are defined
[09:34:16] <i0nC4nn0n> slax0r, what editor do you use?
[09:34:18] <slax0r> vim
[09:34:18] * i0nC4nn0n prepares to lie
[09:34:26] <i0nC4nn0n> man, i use vim as well!
[09:34:29] <slax0r> no wai!
[09:34:36] <slax0r> I'm switching to emacs!
[09:34:38] <i0nC4nn0n> shift+zz all the way bruh!
[09:34:45] <slax0r> uh...wut?
[09:34:49] <i0nC4nn0n> ZZ
[09:34:51] <i0nC4nn0n> like
[09:34:53] <i0nC4nn0n> save and exit...
[09:35:10] <i0nC4nn0n> like !w, but better...
[09:35:19] <arc_> save and exit in vim is :wq iirc
[09:35:31] <i0nC4nn0n> ZZ works as well
[09:35:32] <Uhkis> :x
[09:35:59] <slax0r> i0nC4nn0n: I know, but the "uh...wut?" was more like, you seriously using it too?
[09:36:08] <i0nC4nn0n> i belive ZZ is a shorthand for :wq...
[09:36:14] <i0nC4nn0n> no man, i only know ZZ :)
[09:36:21] <slax0r> killall -9 vim
[09:36:24] <slax0r> the only way to exit vim
[09:36:36] <i0nC4nn0n> (im a sysadmin... well i used to be... and vi is posix, and bla bla bla)
[09:36:54] <i0nC4nn0n> i needed to know how to use it somewhat properly
[09:37:01] <i0nC4nn0n> to edit the network config
[09:37:08] <i0nC4nn0n> so that i can install bullshit-editor-3000
[09:37:24] <slax0r> I like bullshit-editor-3000
[09:38:22] <i0nC4nn0n> me too, when u call it without parameters it starts a bitchX session to freenode, joins #jquery and pretends to be able to type with 200wpm....
[09:38:54] <slax0r> *giggles*
[09:39:27] <arc_> rolleyes
[09:39:34] <i0nC4nn0n> are we sure that !w doesn't work in vi?
[09:39:45] <i0nC4nn0n> im on windoze right now and can't be assed to install it...
[09:39:58] <slax0r> well, !w will just run w on the shell
[09:40:48] <i0nC4nn0n> so it works if i do alias w killall -9 vim in preparation...
[09:41:06] <slax0r> yes, but then you won't save a damn thing :P
[09:41:10] <Uhkis> and now you just overwrote w
[09:41:14] <MajorTennis> has anyone got any inkling why this line of the jquery-ui is throwing errors for me?
[09:41:15] <MajorTennis> return matcher.test( value.label || value.value || value );
[09:41:28] <i0nC4nn0n> Uhkis, slax0r a small price to pay...
[09:41:29] <i0nC4nn0n> :)
[09:41:55] <i0nC4nn0n> can't i setup vi that the shell knows that it is called from within it and just overwrite w as that?
[09:41:55] <Uhkis> and you leave swapfiles laying around!
[09:42:01] <i0nC4nn0n> also: what does w do?
[09:42:11] <Uhkis> shows logged in users
[09:42:12] <slax0r> lists uptime and users connected
[09:42:37] <i0nC4nn0n> how fancy
[09:42:48] <slax0r> and you claim to have been a sysadmin
[09:42:49] <slax0r> shame on you
[09:42:59] <i0nC4nn0n> windows is jsut as good:
[09:42:59] <i0nC4nn0n> 'w' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
[09:43:00] <i0nC4nn0n> operable program or batch file.
[09:43:17] <i0nC4nn0n> slax0r, but i can type with FOURHUNDRET WPM!
[09:43:31] <slax0r> ERMAHGERD
[09:44:25] <arc_> seriously? -_-
[09:44:52] <i0nC4nn0n> come to typeracer and i can prove like 25% of it!
[09:45:01] <MajorTennis> oh i see my air pie has arrived
[09:45:03] <MajorTennis> nomnomnom
[09:45:17] <arc_> i think it would be okay if you stopped harping on that now
[09:45:36] <slax0r> arc_: let him have his fun
[09:47:21] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, ur right, i was just kinda mad at the time
[09:47:50] <arc_> that's a rookie mistake, getting mad on the internet when somebody claims something :p
[09:48:04] <i0nC4nn0n> nah man, i was mad (and am drinking) for a different reason
[09:48:09] <arc_> o ok
[09:48:11] <i0nC4nn0n> but i lashed out on him
[09:48:44] <i0nC4nn0n> and im so drunk that i dont know how to vi
[09:48:54] <i0nC4nn0n> wich is an issue since beer tends to make me wanna take a piss...
[09:49:20] <i0nC4nn0n> but im really feeling im bringing down the level of your chatroom...
[09:50:16] <i0nC4nn0n> arc_, btw, why vim?
[09:50:28] <i0nC4nn0n> why not something fancy like sublime or whatnot?
[09:51:52] <i0nC4nn0n> u started out with it back than when there was nothing else around and didn't feel like switching to fancy shit as it came out? doing it for the geek points or is there a particular reason?
[09:54:55] <slax0r> I think you mean me?
[09:55:30] <slax0r> after you've used vim for 10+ years, you can hardly switch to different editors due to different shortcuts and whatnot
[09:55:58] <i0nC4nn0n> how old are you if u dont mind me axing?
[09:56:47] <slax0r> 29
[09:56:50] <i0nC4nn0n> lol
[09:56:53] <i0nC4nn0n> im 31
[09:56:58] * i0nC4nn0n goes to the corner in shame
[09:57:03] <slax0r> and I'm going home
[09:57:09] <slax0r> monday == over for me
[09:57:15] <slax0r> have fun
[09:57:19] <i0nC4nn0n> tyvm :)
[09:57:27] <i0nC4nn0n> gl & hf
[10:24:23] <hellyeah> i0nC4nn0n: i need your help little bit
[10:24:26] <hellyeah> :D
[10:29:36] <mr_pinc> I've got an issue with jquery mobile radio buttons.  When I launch my app and select a radio button it works fine - becomes selected.  if I select a text field somewhere else in the app (which brings up the keyboard) then I choose one of those radiobuttons the keyboard pops up again which it shouldn't.  This is in a cordova app.  Anyone have an idea on what might be going on?
[10:33:28] <hellyeah> any knows jquery ui datepicker?
[10:57:38] <wolfehr> hi guys, have a weird one with event bubbling. I’ve attached a click handler to an element with a child. In firefox clicking on the parent (whether the child section or parent) triggers the handler with the event.target as the parent. In safari and chrome the event.target returns the child if this is the area clicked on or the parent if the section clicked is not the child, fiddle attached -
[10:57:39] <wolfehr> https://jsfiddle.net/bw4f0uqz/1/
[10:59:45] <NoiseEee> wolfehr: i think its more due to the element you chose, and you're illogical use of putting a listener on a <span> without a <button>
[10:59:51] <NoiseEee> s/without/within/
[10:59:51] <b-ot> Correction, <NoiseEee> wolfehr: i think its more due to the element you chose, and you're illogical use of putting a listener on a <span> within a <button>
[11:00:41] <wolfehr> NoiseEee, the the listener is on the parent button, not the child
[11:01:17] <wolfehr> additionally, the HTML spec mentions nothing interactive should be descendant of a button, so surely the button should absorb everything?
[11:01:39] <NoiseEee> wolfehr: right, so  i think in this case, chrome is doing the 'wrong' thing
[11:03:44] <NoiseEee> wolfehr: ie: https://jsfiddle.net/bw4f0uqz/4/ behaves as expected
[11:04:03] <NoiseEee> wolfehr: but interesting nonetheless
[11:04:05] <NoiseEee> :)
[11:04:23] <NoiseEee> why is the span there, for styling?
[11:04:53] <wolfehr> yep
[11:05:02] <NoiseEee> bummer
[11:05:22] <NoiseEee> well i mean, you get the event regardless, just don't ask/care about from where it originates :)
[11:06:13] <wolfehr> only reason it’s thrown up this issue is because we had a data attribute on the parent, but the child didn’t have it, therefore causing a really weird (and up until now apparently random) error
[11:06:30] <wolfehr> not a biggie, can work around it, just though it was weird enough to throw it out there
[11:57:46] <dimi1947> I have a series of input boxes and I want each time the user checks one...it's value being passed into an array...before going to the array part I have not found a way to correct "catch the value...here is the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/ue17h7ab/ and in line 7 the code that tries to do that(without success))"
[11:58:39] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[11:58:58] <duch_kazatel> you sure you don't mean $(this).val(); ?
[11:59:37] <arc_> also, the second two checkboxes have the same value in your html
[12:00:36] <chrisml> anyone know why the form length returns 0 inside progressall func - http://kopy.io/zjrVw
[12:05:43] <duch_kazatel> chrisml without seeing it, nope.
[12:06:10] <chrisml> duch_kazatel fixed using e.target, of course
[12:06:22] <duch_kazatel> 'kay
[12:08:26] <duch_kazatel> dimi1947 btw https://jsfiddle.net/ue17h7ab/3/
[12:09:49] <dimi1947> duch_kazatel..EXACTLY THAT....thanks
[12:58:09] <ABM_Dan> duch_kazatel: I did manage to do the thing with the radio and onchange.
[12:59:25] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan hrm?
[12:59:57] <ABM_Dan> Friday. Discussion about radio buttons not firing when they go from checked to unchecked.
[13:00:00] <duch_kazatel> i barely remember what i ate for breakfast so if you're talking about something from he other day, i have no recollection
[13:00:54] <duch_kazatel> oh were you the dude who said the event model was wrong for radios?
[13:02:32] <hellyeah> i need help about jquery ui
[13:02:47] <ABM_Dan> Yeah.
[13:03:01] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan 'kay.
[13:04:23] <ABM_Dan> https://gist.github.com/ABM-Dan/595be28c5b3e28bb8070
[13:04:29] <duch_kazatel> Good for you.
[13:05:01] <ABM_Dan> You literally said "I am curious to see what you come up with", that's the only reason why I mention it.
[13:05:04] <hellyeah> ABM_Dan: why is it false?
[13:05:28] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan i still don't think it's a good idea, but I'm glad you found a solution.
[13:05:44] <hellyeah> what is false?
[13:05:49] <hellyeah> why is false?
[13:05:52] <hellyeah> i want to learn
[13:05:52] <duch_kazatel> hellyeah what are you talking about?
[13:05:58] <ABM_Dan> I don't know, what is false?
[13:06:10] <duch_kazatel> hellyeah they disagree with the way the event model works for radio buttons.
[13:06:13] <hellyeah> ABM_Dan: said something wrong about firing events
[13:06:23] <hellyeah> i wonder the reason of him
[13:06:31] <duch_kazatel> he feels that it's counterintuitive.
[13:06:41] <ABM_Dan> I don't like how radio buttons don't fire the change event when they go from checked to unchecked
[13:06:41] <hellyeah> in what extent?
[13:06:48] <ABM_Dan> only when they go from unchecked to checked.
[13:07:01] <hellyeah> it should be fired?
[13:07:06] <duch_kazatel> i don't think it should be.
[13:07:18] <ABM_Dan> I think it should, duch and the w3c people don't.
[13:07:37] <duch_kazatel> as well as the jquery dec team and many, many other people :) but hey, whatever works for you.
[13:07:38] <ABM_Dan> The w3 rationale is that changing a set of radio buttons should only fire one event total.
[13:07:42] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:07:51] <shoky> hellyeah: please, stop saying useless stuff like "i need help about jquery ui" or "is anyone here".  just ask your question.  always
[13:08:02] <shoky> you should know that by now
[13:08:02] <hellyeah> shoky: sorry
[13:08:05] <ABM_Dan> Mine is that if two widgets change, there should be two warnings.
[13:08:13] <ABM_Dan> sorry, two events fired.
[13:08:19] <ABM_Dan> (not two warnings)
[13:09:03] <duch_kazatel> sure, and plenty of people disagree with that.
[13:09:06] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:09:09] <duch_kazatel> it's all good.
[13:10:42] <ABM_Dan> Still, I hope that my implementation is good enough.
[13:11:33] <duch_kazatel> then maybe somebody else can come along and provide some feedback.
[13:13:22] <shoky> two radio buttons are not strictly two widgets
[13:13:40] <hellyeah> lemme try to tell my problem
[13:13:40] <shoky> they are both there to provide one choice for the user
[13:14:15] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:14:20] <shoky> hellyeah: best way is with a jsfiddle ;p
[13:14:47] <ABM_Dan> shoky, from many MANY perspectives, they are two widgets.
[13:14:58] <hellyeah> you can create datepickers and select some dates let say you choose 21 JAN in "from" and 26 JAN in "to" and you create another datepickers i want to see 21,22,23,24,25,26 disabled in another datepickers is there a way for doing this https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/24/
[13:15:08] <arc_> i can't wait to see this conversation again ...
[13:15:26] <ABM_Dan> arc_ I didn't want to have it in the first place.
[13:15:27] <shoky> ABM_Dan those perspectives differ from the html one, so .. not relevant :S
[13:15:31] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[13:17:51] <hellyeah> snything?
[13:17:55] <hellyeah> anything?
[13:18:38] <hellyeah> my question is understadable?
[13:18:51] <duch_kazatel> hellyeah slow down duder.  if somebody can help, they will.
[13:19:48] <hellyeah> hmm okey i just want to make sure my question is understandable sorry
[13:20:14] <duch_kazatel> you're much more likely to get help with a smaller fiddle fwiw.
[13:20:27] <hassoon> hellyeah: turkey is unsafe :o
[13:21:00] <hellyeah> hassoon: i know
[13:21:19] <hellyeah> duch_kazatel: let me try to make small fiddle
[13:29:48] <hellyeah> hey
[13:30:33] <hellyeah> i eliminated unnecessary code in js fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/2wqd0dvt/ my question was you can create datepickers and select some dates let say you choose 21 JAN in "from" and 26 JAN in "to" and you create another datepickers i want to see 21,22,23,24,25,26 disabled in another datepickers is there a way for doing this
[13:32:30] <shoky> hellyeah you mean after you choose a range in first row, you want other rows to have that range disabled ?
[13:32:43] <hellyeah> yes
[13:32:51] <shoky> ok, you can still do that with beforeShowDay
[13:32:54] <shoky> in the same way
[13:33:55] <hellyeah> actually i have tried something it didnt work but let me show you
[13:34:08] <hellyeah> may be i can get somewhere
[13:36:48] <hellyeah> shoky: i tried smt like that does it make sense? https://jsfiddle.net/2wqd0dvt/1/
[13:38:15] <shoky> hellyeah that just ties each "from" datepicker to the "to" datepicker  and vice versa... you're not doing any logic between different rows
[13:39:13] <shoky> also there's a syntax error
[13:42:02] <hellyeah> shoky: i fixed syntax error
[13:42:05] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/2wqd0dvt/2/
[13:42:41] <shoky> ok, still doesn't do anything between different rows tho
[13:42:58] <shoky> and doesn't really make sense
[13:43:50] <hellyeah> actually i dont have any idea about doing this if you have time can you give me some tips?
[13:45:50] <shoky> hellyeah: in beforeShowDay of a certain datepicker, for a certain date, you now need to decide if it's enabled or not
[13:46:50] <shoky> hellyeah:  let's say you're in the 5th row, in the "to" datepicker,  the date being checked is feb 25.  do you want it to be enabled or not?  how would you decide?
[13:47:56] <hellyeah> i want to disable it in next datepicker
[13:48:18] <hellyeah> but not just 25 the date between "from" and "to"
[13:48:25] <shoky> that's not what i asked
[13:48:50] <shoky> there's only 5 rows, no next datepicker.
[13:49:19] <hellyeah> okey
[13:49:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:50:06] <hellyeah> i want it to be disabled
[13:50:31] <shoky> that's your logic?  it's always disabled?
[13:51:04] <hellyeah> is it false logic?
[13:51:06] <shoky> even if i didnt choose any other ranges ?
[13:51:09] <shoky> what?
[13:51:42] <hellyeah> if you dont choose any range there is no disable dates
[13:52:05] <shoky> then you dont always want it disabled
[13:52:15] <shoky> so, how do you decide
[13:52:19] <hellyeah> but for example if you choose date in 5th datepickers "from" you will see smaller date between those dates are disabled in "to"
[13:52:27] <hellyeah> well
[13:52:33] <hellyeah> you have to select a date
[13:52:38] <shoky> ok so that part we already took care of
[13:53:13] <hellyeah> yes
[13:53:19] <shoky> ok lets say in that 5th row in "from"  i have chosen feb 20
[13:53:36] <hellyeah> okey
[13:53:50] <hellyeah> you cannot select date in"to" smaller then feb 20
[13:53:55] <shoky> so  in the "to" datepicker,  for feb 25,  should it be enabled or disabled
[13:54:02] <shoky> how do you decide
[13:54:03] <hellyeah> ah
[13:54:07] <hellyeah> okey
[13:54:20] <hellyeah> feb 25 is bigger then feb 20
[13:54:30] <hellyeah> you can check the dates and decide it
[13:54:38] <shoky> ok , that part we already took care of...
[13:54:47] <shoky> but there's also the other rows, right..
[13:54:57] <hellyeah> yes
[13:54:59] <shoky> maybe in 3rd row i chose range of  feb 23 - feb 30
[13:55:18] <shoky> so then , what do you decide for feb 25th in the 5th row ?
[13:55:35] <hellyeah> disabled
[13:55:57] <hellyeah> because it is in the range of feb 23 and feb 30
[13:55:58] <shoky> ok. so it depends on the "from" of current row,  and on the "from" and "to" of previous rows, if there are any
[13:56:12] <hellyeah> yes
[13:56:14] <shoky> so this is the logic you need to put in beforeShowDay
[13:56:33] <shoky> (at least to start with.. later you can make some changes for better performance)
[13:57:32] <shoky> to get previous rows you can do something like  $(this).closest('.datepicker').prevAll('.datepicker')
[13:57:52] <shoky> ok that's enough tips.. go work ;p
[13:58:49] <AlexRussia> Hi! Is there any tips about how to attach event to changing #id in page url? Like when foo.html#1 changes to foo.html#2?
[13:59:36] <shoky> AlexRussia: "hashchange" event on window
[14:00:05] <AlexRussia> shoky: okay, thanks!
[14:07:03] <hellyeah> what does this error mean Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined https://jsfiddle.net/2wqd0dvt/4/
[14:08:51] <shoky> hellyeah: you're not returning a valid return value from beforeShowDay
[14:15:02] <hellyeah> so
[14:15:19] <hellyeah> shoky: what i think to do push all dates value into an array
[14:15:34] <hellyeah> and make foreach then ncheck it with if condition
[14:15:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:16:01] <hellyeah> disable next element
[14:16:09] <hellyeah> disable dates in next element
[14:16:14] <hellyeah> does it make any sense?
[14:16:25] <shoky> in beforeShowDay  you don't care about the next element..
[14:16:50] <shoky> you only decide for the current element. and as we said, its based on current row and previous rows. next rows are not relevant, if there are even any
[14:17:58] <shoky> beforeShowDay asks you for a certain date, if THIS datepicker should have that date enabled.  you dont make any decisions here for next datepickers, they will have their own beforeShowDay to decide for them
[14:23:23] <hellyeah> shoky: i understand
[14:24:57] <hellyeah> i meantioned my intension wrongly
[14:25:46] <hellyeah> for example when you are in second datapicker
[14:26:00] <hellyeah> you get pervious dates and decide those decide enable or disable
[14:52:17] <jak2000> lines = ["123", "1222", "1231", "", "134", "422", ""]  how to delete, empty items? "" ?
[14:52:40] <duch_kazatel> what's generating the array?>
[14:55:20] <duch_kazatel> jak2000
[14:55:33] <duch_kazatel> because generally you want to fix that side of things.
[14:55:40] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you can use .filter()
[14:59:45] <Inane> Okay so I'm trying to write a REST api in python, and serve the front end with jquery. However I'm getting a error saying "SyntaxError json.parse end at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data". This is my my python code "https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8208c92c6a80c8c5ec85" and this is my jquery "https://gist.github.com/anonymous/27d2e160882d4132cb6d"
[15:00:27] <duch_kazatel> hit the api directly and share the data out here.
[15:00:33] <duch_kazatel> in a fiddle or paste or something.
[15:00:59] <hellyeah> hey may be simple question
[15:00:59] <hellyeah> but why all dates are disabled? https://jsfiddle.net/2wqd0dvt/5/
[15:01:34] <duch_kazatel> hellyeah removing the return 0; seems to fix it?
[15:01:49] <hellyeah> i have to return something
[15:02:02] <duch_kazatel> just telling you why.,
[15:02:21] <duch_kazatel> also, you sure return [!fromDate || (date >= fromDate), "", ""]; is right?
[15:03:20] <hellyeah> yes https://jsfiddle.net/2wqd0dvt/7/
[15:03:38] <hellyeah> select a date from "from" and see that dates are disable in "to"
[15:03:51] <duch_kazatel> okay.  so you need to return an array.
[15:03:52] <duch_kazatel> see the issue?
[15:04:29] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-beforeShowDay
[15:04:39] <duch_kazatel> you need to return an array with three things in it.,
[15:04:45] <jak2000> duch_kazatel: done: lines = lines.filter(function(n){ return n != "" });
[15:05:11] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 i'd try to fix whatever is generating the array in the first place.
[15:05:17] <duch_kazatel> aslo, you can just do return n;
[15:05:19] <duch_kazatel> no need to compare.
[15:06:05] <jak2000> ok
[15:06:07] <jak2000> now: lines = ["123", "1222", "1231", "134", "422"]   <= i want generate a random element how do that?
[15:06:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:06:57] <jak2000> random.choise intersting
[15:07:07] <duch_kazatel> you want to choose a random entry from that array?
[15:07:14] <jak2000> yes
[15:07:18] <jak2000> 5 elements in this case
[15:09:42] <duch_kazatel> my work connection is whacked, but you basically want to generate a random number bounded by the length of the array.
[15:11:42] <jak2000> duch_kazatel: foo = lines[Math.floor(Math.random()*lines.length)];
[15:11:52] <duch_kazatel> something like that, yeah.
[15:12:09] <jak2000> is sure, get the first and the end elements?
[15:12:12] <jak2000> was considered?
[15:12:19] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:13:28] <jak2000> foo = lines[Math.floor(Math.random()*lines.length)];   < --- consider the first and last element?
[15:13:37] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand what you're asking.
[15:15:27] <duch_kazatel> oh, you want to know if that'll work for every element in an array?
[15:15:53] <jak2000> yes
[15:15:59] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[15:37:56] <nmschulte> With jQuery UI Draggable, is it possible to make the draggable (or its helper) cause overflowed containers to scroll?  I tried appending the helper to the container I want it to cause to scroll, but it doesn't seem to work as I expect (it doesn't scroll the container, it makes the document/viewport/other container bigger).
[15:54:15] <shoky> nmschulte: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-scroll
[16:01:05] <nmschulte> shoky: Thanks.  I've perused the documentation quite a bit and played with various configurations of options, but I can't achieve my desired effect.  I think the plugin simply isn't flexible enough to do what I'm after.
[16:01:17] <nmschulte> I'm going to add "scroll up" and "scroll down" "
[16:01:32] <shoky> nmschulte if you make a jsfiddle we can try to help
[16:01:47] <nmschulte> "Droppable hotspots" to the containers I want to scroll and enable scrolling that way.
[16:03:13] <jak2000> exist a sleep function? i want do a for i=0 to 10... and every loop sleep 10 seconds.
[16:03:26] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 you can set timeouts.
[16:21:09] <nmschulte> shoky: here is a fiddle: I want the gray boxes to cause the srollbars on the left to move when it's at the correct spots to do so.
[16:21:12] <nmschulte> https://jsfiddle.net/1d80f2tL/
[16:22:24] <jak2000> duch_kazatel thanks
[16:22:54] <nmschulte> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/1d80f2tL/1/ -- if you drag the "test" anchor/link to the areas in the red w/ scroll bars, you'll notice that it causes the areas to scroll.  dragging the gray boxes does not.
[16:31:25] <wa5ted> i got a question for a juqery master here
[16:31:30] <wa5ted> jquery
[16:31:36] <duch_kazatel> if you have a question, just ask.
[16:31:40] <duch_kazatel> if somebody can answer, they will :)
[16:33:04] <wa5ted> so for html5 video , you can choose to show no controls and create your own so that they can manage the video, how exactly does that work
[16:33:17] <wa5ted> because from my understanding
[16:33:22] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with jquery>
[16:33:46] <wa5ted> Failed to execute 'play' on 'HTMLMediaElement': API can only be initiated by a user gesture.
[16:33:55] <wa5ted> im just curious how juqery handles that
[16:34:07] <wa5ted> because technically the playing of the video should be blocked
[16:34:22] <duch_kazatel> none of what you're asking has anything to do with jquery.
[16:35:41] <wa5ted> well there has got to be something
[16:35:49] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/building-custom-controls-for-html5-videos
[16:35:55] <duch_kazatel> lots of tutorials out there.
[16:36:05] <shoky> nmschulte: yah can't find an easy way to get that to work, sorry ;p  the test link only scrolled the top area for me btw
[16:41:50] <nmschulte> shoky: in Chromium (Chrome), the
[16:49:13] <shoky> nmschulte: your message got cut off i think
[16:56:57] <DrRush> http://pastebin.com/TFZqgygU
[16:57:25] <DrRush> Why does this return the error 'unexpected string'
[16:57:26] <duch_kazatel> you want .keydown(result);
[16:57:50] <duch_kazatel> doing .keydown(result()); immediately runs that function and assigns the return to be the handler for you.
[16:58:25] <DrRush> okay fixed that
[16:58:47] <DrRush> but still has the same error
[16:58:56] <duch_kazatel> i'd nbeed to see a fiddle then.,
[16:59:11] <DrRush> okay give me a min
[16:59:25] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[16:59:27] <nmschulte> shoky: In Chromium (Chrome) the "test" link scrolls whatever scrollbar I am hovering on; not quite perfect, but acceptable.  Anyway, looks like I'm asking for a bit much from the plugin.  I'll see what I can wrangle on my own.  The "test" link scroll thing is browser dependent, it seems.
[16:59:33] <duch_kazatel> back code format DrRush
[16:59:46] <duch_kazatel> $('document').ready(function() {
[16:59:51] <duch_kazatel> not $('document').ready(function({
[17:01:16] <DrRush> http://jsbin.com/ziyijo/edit?js,console,output
[17:04:42] <DrRush> duch_kazatel: thanks
[17:14:01] <ngharo> DrRush: use keyup and you can get the value like so: parseFloat(this.value)
[17:15:06] <ngharo> also, $(document) not $('document')
[17:36:36] <ABM_Dan> Yeah, you can actually get the document, no need to be ironic about it.
[17:37:37] <ABM_Dan> Sorry, boring day.
[17:39:00] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[17:39:31] <ABM_Dan> joke about air quotes as unnecessary quotes.
[17:39:38] <duch_kazatel> 'kay
[17:50:47] <jak2000> hi all
[17:51:19] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/crqbep07/   <--- notknow why i not see the effect 1... to 10 every 4 seconds... any advice?  (click on "Calcular" button)..
[17:51:56] <duch_kazatel> what are you tyring to do?
[17:52:02] <duch_kazatel> make something happen every x seconds?
[17:52:04] <mneri> is it possible to have only "few pieces" of jquery, namely the selector framework ($("#myid")) and the animation framework?
[17:52:27] <duch_kazatel> mneri yes - you can do a custom build.  check out the repo's readme.md for more information.
[17:53:01] <jak2000> duch_kazatel, yes
[17:53:09] <duch_kazatel> though you shgould be fine just including the whole library, mneri
[17:53:19] <jak2000> every 4 seconds calculate something nd display the number 1 to 10...
[17:53:33] <mneri> duch_kazatel: thx
[17:57:39] <jak2000> duch_kazatel any advice?
[17:58:44] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bggbbthx/3/ you want this.
[17:59:08] <duch_kazatel> or something similar.
[18:01:09] <jak2000> yes checking
[18:01:20] <duch_kazatel> should give you the basic idea.
[18:01:48] <jak2000> only 10 times
[18:01:56] <duch_kazatel> then add a constraint check.
[18:01:56] <jak2000> ok working on my fiddle
[18:02:03] <duch_kazatel> simplify the idea though.
[18:09:40] <jak2000> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/crqbep07/6/   i get this error: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded  why?
[18:10:40] <ryanneufeld> jak2000: usually it's due to a recursive function call using too much memory
[18:10:46] <duch_kazatel> ^
[18:11:31] <ryanneufeld> calculaGanador++;
[18:11:38] <duch_kazatel> you're reusing that var.
[18:11:38] <ryanneufeld> you're incrementing a function?
[18:11:57] <ryanneufeld> I didn't know you do operator overloading in JS like that :p
[18:12:15] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[18:12:27] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 you're convoluting this.  your usarios var doesn't exist.
[18:14:05] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/crqbep07/8/   better?
[18:14:25] <duch_kazatel> open your console.
[18:14:51] <jak2000>  usuarios.length)];   error on length
[18:14:56] <jak2000> but i pass as parameter?
[18:14:59] <duch_kazatel> window.setTimeout(calculaGanador, 1000); doesn't pass the usuarios var back in.
[18:15:09] <jak2000> why not take?
[18:15:11] <jak2000> ahh right
[18:15:23] <duch_kazatel> gotta either use .bind() or put the var up in a higher place to hold state.
[18:15:44] <duch_kazatel> also, for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { get rid of this.
[18:15:50] <duch_kazatel> and use an incrementor
[18:15:58] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're going to fire all 10 at the same time.
[18:16:11] <jak2000> ok understand
[18:16:50] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/crqbep07/11/
[18:16:59] <jak2000> again the error: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[18:17:00] <jak2000> :(
[18:17:28] <duch_kazatel> window.setTimeout(calculaGanador( usuarios ), 1000); is wrong.
[18:17:34] <duch_kazatel> your immediately running calculaGanador.
[18:17:37] <duch_kazatel> you have to use .bind()
[18:18:03] <jak2000> ok
[18:25:20] <jak2000> i try: window.setTimeout(.bind(calculaGanador( usuarios )), 1000); not work
[18:25:32] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[18:25:56] <duch_kazatel> i can't think of anything in javascript that works by starting with a period.
[18:28:13] <ABM_Dan> Womanhood.
[18:28:20] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:28:34] <ABM_Dan> Slow day. The bane of the pun haters.
[18:29:13] <duch_kazatel> 'cept i'm not a pun hater.  just don't see how javascript is related to "womanhood"
[18:29:20] <duch_kazatel> but 'kay
[18:29:27] <ABM_Dan> Girls gotta code too.
[18:29:38] <duch_kazatel> uh.  okay.
[18:38:58] <gnat42> just out of curiosity
[18:39:01] <gnat42> is this legit?
[18:39:09] <gnat42> .on('change', 'input[name="practice_choice"]', function(){
[18:39:32] <gnat42> particularly when its called on from a div element
[18:39:58] <duch_kazatel> sure - if the div is a parent.
[18:40:02] <duch_kazatel> that's a delegated listener.
[18:40:09] <gnat42> ok
[18:40:21] <duch_kazatel> i'd avoid using the attribute selector, but meh.
[18:40:39] <gnat42> so when an input with that name is checked/changed the event should fire?
[18:40:52] <duch_kazatel> *handler, not event.
[18:40:53] <duch_kazatel> and yes.
[18:41:44] <gnat42> yeah, somehow it isn't unfortunately, I have an alert in the handler and it doesn't do anything
[18:41:53] <gnat42> something must be messed up somewhere
[18:42:17] <duch_kazatel> is the div a parent of the input?
[18:42:33] <gnat42> not direct no
[18:42:59] <duch_kazatel> "not direct"?
[18:43:02] <gnat42> div.id>div>div>label>input
[18:43:10] <duch_kazatel> so it's an ancestor.
[18:43:14] <duch_kazatel> does it exist on pageload?
[18:43:17] <gnat42> yes
[18:43:18] <duch_kazatel> also, is that ID replicated?
[18:43:30] <gnat42> no
[18:43:38] <gnat42> meaning I have no other element with that id
[18:43:40] <duch_kazatel> then i dunno.  i'd have to see it.
[18:44:22] <gnat42> http://www.fpaste.org/312171/16065214/
[18:44:26] <gnat42> is the markup
[18:44:57] <ABM_Dan> maybe put a breakpoint on the assignation and make sure that at the time of the execution .find('input[name="practice_choice"]') matches stuff.
[18:45:32] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan only matters when it runs.
[18:46:03] <ABM_Dan> I mean on the .on line, not inside of the function.
[18:46:09] <duch_kazatel> that's what i'm saying.
[18:46:26] <gnat42> yeah so I added a element.find('input[name=".."]')
[18:46:27] <duch_kazatel> if the contents of the element are changing, then the child may not exist.
[18:46:28] <ABM_Dan> well yeah, I'm trying to see if the DOM is in the same structure.
[18:46:29] <duch_kazatel> that should be fine.
[18:46:33] <gnat42> and using chrome's js debugger
[18:46:38] <duch_kazatel> gnat42 what's the js look like?
[18:46:38] <gnat42> elements.length = 0
[18:47:04] <gnat42> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/312173/31608161
[18:47:06] <ABM_Dan> Ok, so you know you're not matching stuff, and it's not failing to bind the listener.
[18:47:08] <gnat42> is the current JS
[18:47:15] <gnat42> yeah it looks like it ABM_Dan
[18:47:17] <duch_kazatel> which handler in this file?
[18:47:36] <duch_kazatel> oh, easy.
[18:47:37] <duch_kazatel> var practiceSelect = $('.practice-select');
[18:47:40] <duch_kazatel> you want #
[18:47:42] <ABM_Dan> Yeah.
[18:47:47] <gnat42> ah crap
[18:47:50] <duch_kazatel> wrong selector :)
[18:47:52] <ABM_Dan> Sketchy as heck :)
[18:48:20] <gnat42> yay!
[18:48:33] <gnat42> I'm not a JS developer and I'm trying to modify the markup to what I want and the JS along with it
[18:48:37] <gnat42> thanks for that
[18:48:44] <duch_kazatel> yeah, so # is for IDs, . for classes.
[18:48:55] <akkufomk> thanks for gnat! rofl
[19:07:35] <akkufomk> I made a funny
[19:08:13] <duch_kazatel> welp
