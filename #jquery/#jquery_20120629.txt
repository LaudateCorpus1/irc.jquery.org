[00:00:04] <TheresaJayne> i have 2 bits of jquery, both work independantly - both are handlers set up in the document ready
[00:00:14] <TheresaJayne> when i put them both together one stops
[00:00:30] <lordmortis> can you put them on jsfiddle?
[00:00:37] <TheresaJayne> or one doesnt do what i expected to happen
[00:00:45] <TheresaJayne> have you a link
[00:00:53] <lordmortis> it's in the topic.
[00:02:35] <coldhead> ?p
[00:02:44] <coldhead> oh bot-t, i miss you
[00:02:57] <TheresaJayne> i dont get how that works?
[00:03:12] <coldhead> paste your javascript in the bottom left pane
[00:03:14] <coldhead> and click save
[00:03:23] <coldhead> then paste the URL in here
[00:05:02] <TheresaJayne> ok well to begin, https://gist.github.com/3016402  is the overview, i will get the html / js up on jsfiddle in a sec
[00:05:49] <Xard> seems like initializing checkbox and radio input elements has to be done with elem.prop('checked', true) instead of being cheap and just elem.click() on them
[00:06:16] <Xard> actually the click way worked with chrome, but for some reason firefox doesn't like it
[00:06:33] <coldhead> TheresaJayne: the selectors on line 2 and 19 are different
[00:06:49] <coldhead> do you really have both Salons and salon classes?
[00:07:40] <TheresaJayne> read them as the same, its 2 pages, the top code is the working spike
[00:08:00] <coldhead> cool, just checking
[00:08:53] <TheresaJayne> bottom code is attempted run, unless there is a way to set a timer in jquery to run the pagemethod bit at regular intervals
[00:09:28] <coldhead> ?mdc setinterval
[00:09:29] <coldhead> damn, no bot
[00:09:29] <TheresaJayne> in which case i revert to the working hover and leave the update later
[00:09:36] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval
[00:09:56] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead, nested timeouts > interval
[00:10:16] <coldhead> preaching to the choir, blackspotwiggins
[00:10:41] <coldhead> http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful is one of my favourite JS posts
[00:10:53] <coldhead> buuut sometimes one doesn't feel like adding recursion to someone's problems
[00:11:23] <TheresaJayne> http://jsfiddle.net/ZkYt9/
[00:12:03] <coldhead> TheresaJayne: does it work any better if you move this line to AFTER the animation? PageMethods.CheckSalon(id);
[00:12:04] <TheresaJayne> sorry about missing html as its a generated page
[00:12:36] <TheresaJayne> coldhead dont know as the animation is to display the data returned from the call
[00:12:50] <coldhead> ahh
[00:13:06] <coldhead> that might be the problem
[00:13:21] <coldhead> if it takes a while to add the data or it modifies the page
[00:13:44] <TheresaJayne> its a simple object being returned
[00:13:50] <TheresaJayne> as json
[00:15:29] <Xotix> hi, I'm trying to convert the breaking of a word by a contenteditable div into a <br>. Is this possible? http://jsfiddle.net/AfcrQ/9/
[00:15:37] <TheresaJayne> i am getting back on hover the following {"d":{"__type":"iBookings.DAL.iBookingsWebService.SiteInfo","SiteName":null,"DBVersion":0,"WSVersion":null,"DLLVersion":null}}
[00:16:17] <TheresaJayne> (sometimes with data as well)
[00:28:32] <coldhead> TheresaJayne: but if that call is talking to the server via AJAX, it might take a while to finish
[00:28:47] <coldhead> and your animation code will run in the meantime
[00:29:18] <coldhead> so you might need a way to make the animation wait for the communication with the server to finish
[00:29:58] <TheresaJayne> thats what i thought coldhead, but the "sample text" is not being displayed either
[00:30:28] <TheresaJayne> i will have to revisit that when the other pages are skinned appropriately
[00:30:43] <TheresaJayne> in the mean time i have a useless looking table
[00:30:46] <coldhead> TheresaJayne: are you able to modify the code in PageMethods.CheckSalon(id); ?
[00:31:00] <TheresaJayne> yes
[00:31:18] <TheresaJayne> but not by much, as it in itself calls a WSE3 webservice
[00:31:46] <coldhead> TheresaJayne: my approach would be to add console.log() statements to that and before and after the animations
[00:31:53] <coldhead> so you can see what order things actually happen in
[00:32:01] <coldhead> by studying your console
[00:32:16] <TheresaJayne> i will relook at the code with your suggestions,
[00:32:20] <TheresaJayne> thanks
[00:32:23] <coldhead> i would expect you'll see "animation starts", "animation ends" and then a while later "data returned from server"
[00:32:43] <coldhead> so then you'd need to find a way to move the animation into the bit that runs when the data is returned
[00:32:47] <coldhead> good luck TheresaJayne !
[00:40:03] <JeremieDeNoob> i have some code i am trying to add to work with jqgrid but i dont know where im suppose to add it ? is this suppose to go in the jquery.js?
[00:40:18] <JeremieDeNoob> http://pastie.org/4170120
[00:40:21] <JeremieDeNoob> it looks like this
[00:40:36] <JeremieDeNoob> can anyone identify if this goes in html, css, javascript, or php?
[00:40:49] <JeremieDeNoob> or something entirely differnt maybe
[00:40:53] <lordmorti> what's the best way to get a jqueryUI datepicker to appear in a given direction (in my case, up) ?
[00:42:09] <JeremieDeNoob> lordmortis:  i dont know if anyone is really too active on here, i dont know the answer to your question... did u look at my pastie?
[00:42:23] <lordmortis> I did, but i've never used jqgrid :/
[00:42:43] <coldhead> it should go inside <script> tags, JeremieDeNoob
[00:42:56] <JeremieDeNoob> ok thanks cold head!
[00:43:08] <coldhead> you're really going to need to learn some web fundamentals or you'll go crazy guessing your way through this
[00:43:30] <systemfault> JS is level 3 :D
[00:43:38] <systemfault> Level 1 being HTML… and 2 CSS
[00:43:40] <coldhead> JeremieDeNoob: absorb at least the first chapter of http://jqfundamentals.com/
[00:44:27] <JeremieDeNoob> good advice no doubt
[00:45:19] <systemfault> Mouais.. tu vas finir par vouloir te tirer une balle si tu commence direct avec jquery...
[00:45:34] <optraz> $.fn.digits <== what does this means?
[00:45:39] <systemfault> (Taking a chance with the french sentence :P )
[00:45:51] <systemfault> optraz: What is the "this"?
[00:46:03] <optraz> systemfault: that expression
[00:46:07] <optraz> i dont understand
[00:46:47] * TheresaJayne wonders if bashing her head on a sharp spike might be less painful than trying to convert a table to CSSPos elements
[00:46:48] <systemfault> $ is the jquery function.. fn is an alias for .prototype and digit is some variable of the prototype.
[00:47:39] <optraz> systemfault: so why is it join together using dot operator?
[00:47:57] <thebest`> hi how can i create a modal dialog which displays as div overlay, i tried this but its faulty http://jsfiddle.net/AKJJc/
[00:48:26] <systemfault> optraz: :'( At this point, you need a JS tutorial :/
[00:48:33] <Xard> okay, another nice to know thing about firefox: if i set input property to disabled and change its text value it won't update unless i remove the disabled property and enable it again... chrome shows the change despite input element being disabled
[00:49:29] <systemfault> thebest`: position fixed might help
[00:50:53] <thebest`> systemfault: i see ok and a close link, how can i just have one ok button which when clicked closes dialog
[00:51:07] <optraz> systemfault: okay, i just want to modify a variable to include the | in between
[00:51:30] <optraz> systemfault: the variable is in javascript, var foo = blabla, i want to add | in between bla and bla
[00:51:49] <systemfault> thebest`: Ahhh, my bad, it's jquery ui :/ Sorry, I don't know anything about it
[00:52:07] <thebest`> systemfault: can this be done with jquery only?
[00:52:18] <systemfault> thebest`: jquery ui is the easiest way
[00:52:45] <systemfault> optraz: What is the function supposed to do exactly?
[00:53:12] <systemfault> optraz: I could tell you how to split that string in 2… but it wouldn't be useful
[00:53:14] <optraz> systemfault: to add a | in between bla
[00:53:37] <systemfault> var foo = "bla|bla"; //done
[00:54:34] <optraz> lol
[00:54:34] <Xard> hmm... is there a simple way to tell if i really clicked an element with pointer or called .click() from javascript?
[00:54:49] <optraz> systemfault: yes, but the variable foo will change to like blablabla
[00:54:56] <optraz> i wanna add | after 3 characters.
[00:55:02] <systemfault> Ahhh
[00:55:12] <systemfault> optraz: That's what you should have asked ;)
[00:55:43] <systemfault> optraz: So, it must be generic and split every 3 char?
[00:57:19] <Xotix> how can i add a new char to a string before the last one?
[00:57:20] <systemfault> ?eval "blalollul".match(/.{3}/g)
[00:57:50] <systemfault> ?eval "blalollul".match(/.{3}/g).join('|');
[00:57:54] <systemfault> stupid bot..
[00:58:04] <systemfault> optraz: See if my code is good enough.
[00:58:14] <Xard> i figured out if i check inside the .click function from event "typeof event.button !== 'undefined' ? true : false;" it does what i want but i'm not sure if it'll cause side effects
[00:59:47] <systemfault> Xotix: For the string.. you'll need to split it and reconstruct it..
[01:00:04] <optraz> mmm
[01:00:22] <optraz> very good.
[01:00:26] <optraz> let me try in javascript
[01:00:32] <systemfault> Xard: For the event.. if you really need to know if it was triggered manually or programmatically… you have a design issue.
[01:01:04] <systemfault> Xard: But you could explicitely pass event data when triggering the event
[01:02:01] <systemfault> Xard: See the documentation for the .trigger function
[01:06:48] <tocka> Hey guys
[01:06:56] <systemfault> HAI
[01:08:53] <tocka> Strange things are happening, im using jquery validation plugin to validate a registration form, im checking is the username valid using remote and posting the value to the php file where it checks is the username available or not, when the user registers the first time logouts and tries to register again the remote sends the post to the file, but I get no response and no errors. After I close
[01:08:53] <tocka> and reopen the browser again it works fine then for 1 registration, what could be the problem?
[01:08:59] <tocka> Its just so confusing
[01:09:34] <blackspotwiggins> tocka, cache?
[01:09:36] <TheresaJayne> how do you determine when to call the ajax?
[01:10:59] <tocka> a moment
[01:11:42] <thebest`> TheresaJayne: you call it on an event
[01:12:02] <tocka> TheresaJayne these are the rules
[01:12:03] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/vECgV0XU
[01:12:39] <tocka> blackspotwiggins so how could I clear the cache then?
[01:13:56] <thebest`> i am trying to create modal dialog http://jsfiddle.net/AKJJc/ but its not displaying as div overlay as i want it to
[01:15:18] <blackspotwiggins> tocka, cache:false in ajax
[01:15:24] <blackspotwiggins> $.ajax()
[01:16:28] <tocka> but where should I insert cache: false?
[01:16:36] <tocka> in the submit handler?
[01:16:48] <systemfault> Why would it be a caching problem?
[01:17:07] <systemfault> He says he has no response… like if the ajax call is not even done :(
[01:17:18] <tocka> its like the call is being sent
[01:17:27] <tocka> I can see it from firebug
[01:17:29] <tocka> but no response
[01:17:34] <tocka> thats so strange
[01:17:58] <systemfault> Yeah :(
[01:18:00] <tco> When using .delegate in order to bind events, what would be the correct approach if I want the callback function to reveice the element in question as an argument?
[01:19:11] <systemfault> tco: Can't you use "this"?
[01:20:31] <tco> Ah, should've remembered scoping :)
[01:20:36] <tco> Stupid me
[01:21:11] <tocka> also when i try to do a remote to a simple .html file
[01:21:15] <tocka> I get the same error
[01:21:21] <tocka> after trying to register for the second time
[01:21:26] <blackspotwiggins> tocka, you arent using file://, are you?
[01:21:30] <tocka> nooo
[01:21:35] <blackspotwiggins> just in case..
[01:21:44] <blackspotwiggins> well, maybe your server dun goofed
[01:21:58] <tocka> argh, thats is so irritating
[01:24:54] <optraz> systemfault: does not work
[01:25:16] <optraz> systemfault: the function, .match(...) and .join(...)
[01:25:22] <optraz> is it applicable to javascript variable?
[01:25:34] <optraz> i have the javascript variable declare as var foo = blabla;
[01:25:38] <fRAiLtY-> For some odd reason, here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing should be set so when you click the snow scene image it appends it to the main image, which it does. But it also opens it in a new window? Why?
[01:26:10] <systemfault> optraz: It worked in my browser...
[01:26:56] <systemfault> Fuck jsfiddle is bad tonight..
[01:27:18] <optraz> u sure?
[01:27:19] <noaXess> he hey
[01:27:20] <optraz> show me in jsfiddle
[01:27:23] <optraz> systemfault: ^^
[01:27:28] <noaXess> how to force custom ui class for buttons?
[01:29:09] <systemfault> optraz: It's loading… super slowly..
[01:29:42] <optraz> ok, loaded here
[01:30:13] <noaXess> got it.. kust use <div class="custom_scope"><button...></button></div>
[01:30:18] <noaXess> just ^
[01:30:37] <systemfault> optraz: Anyway… paste that in jsfiddle: var foo = "blalollul"; alert(foo.match(/.{3}/g).join("|"));
[01:31:39] <optraz> systemfault: alright, just a min
[01:32:55] <optraz> k now very slow here too
[01:32:56] <optraz> damn
[01:34:47] <systemfault> optraz: In any event… just open your browser's JS console...
[01:34:52] <systemfault> And paste the lines in it.
[01:38:17] <optraz> systemfault: works in jsfiddle, but in my browser, it complaint Error: foo.match is not a function
[01:38:36] <systemfault> foo must not be a string then
[01:38:49] <systemfault> console.log it
[01:39:45] <optraz> systemfault: okay, i console.log(foo); but what should i do next?
[01:40:05] <systemfault> What type is it?
[01:40:30] <optraz> where should i check the log ?
[01:40:35] <systemfault> omg..
[01:40:41] <systemfault> optraz: What is your browser?
[01:41:21] <optraz> firefox
[01:41:30] <fRAiLtY-> For some odd reason, here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing should be set so when you click the snow scene image it appends it to the main image, which it does. But it also opens it in a new window? Why?+
[01:41:32] <systemfault> You have firebug installed?
[01:41:36] <systemfault> optraz: ^^
[01:41:46] <optraz> yes, i do
[01:42:00] <systemfault> optraz: Open it… and click on the console tab
[01:42:20] <systemfault> optraz: That's where your console.log statements goes.
[01:42:23] <optraz> yes, now i saw, it just show digits
[01:42:28] <optraz> systemfault:  i see, noted
[01:42:49] <systemfault> If they're digits then of course .match won't work
[01:43:46] <optraz> systemfault: okay, then what is the alternative to match(...) ?
[01:44:00] <systemfault> alternative?
[01:44:06] <systemfault> What do you want to do already? :/
[01:44:16] <systemfault> You have some number, right?
[01:44:16] <optraz> lol
[01:44:22] <wathek> Hi everybodyu
[01:44:37] <optraz> yes, i have number like 123456, i want for every 3 character/digits, a | is appended
[01:44:40] <optraz> systemfault: ^^
[01:44:52] <systemfault> optraz: then foo.toString().match.......
[01:45:07] <systemfault> optraz: Just add .toString() before the match
[01:45:15] <optraz> i see
[01:45:17] <optraz> just a moment
[01:49:54] <wathek> how can I change the position of a cloned element with jquery before appending it to my document ?
[01:50:19] <wathek> I'm doing this : clone.offset({"top": 0, "left": 0 }); $("#thumb_2").append(clone);
[01:50:44] <wathek> but it always takes the original element position
[01:51:24] <chilversc_> just to double check, there's no way to wrap a script in a (function() { ... })(); but still know what function/variables are inside that wrapped block?
[01:51:48] <systemfault> wathek: You cannot "set" the position with offset...
[01:52:05] <chilversc_> trying to isolate a section of script that's output by a different application so it doesn't conflict
[01:52:07] <systemfault> wathek: You need to use .css
[01:52:16] <wathek> systemfault, oh ok thank you let me try that
[01:52:24] <optraz> systemfault: dont work though
[01:52:32] <optraz> foo.toString().match(/.{3}/g).join("|");
[01:53:14] <wathek> thank you systemfault it works
[01:53:31] <systemfault> wathek: You're welcome :)
[01:54:31] <optraz> work in jsfiddle but not in the code..
[01:54:47] <systemfault> optraz: I cannot really help at this point :'(
[01:55:47] <optraz> foo.toString().match(/.3/g) is null
[01:55:52] <optraz> the console error show that
[01:56:03] <systemfault> chilversc_: No, what's inside the closure is isolated, if you need access to some variables then make them global (At least, in their own namespace)
[01:56:30] <systemfault> optraz: That's not the regex I gave you
[01:57:22] <optraz> systemfault: i know, but i pasted that error from the firebug console
[01:59:05] <toxz> hi! how can i check if an element is a text input`
[01:59:07] <chilversc_> systemfault: yeah, the problem is I don't know what is inside there, the script is generated by an external app, I wanted to isolate it in to its own scope, but some of the JS calls functions it expects to be global, but again, I wanted to wrap them. said functions come from a different script that's included though
[01:59:29] <tocka> im getting my ajax posts cancelled
[01:59:33] <tocka> what could be the reason?
[01:59:45] <toxz> an error
[01:59:46] <optraz> systemfault: i know why.. the {} is parsed by the php smarty
[01:59:56] <systemfault> Heh..
[01:59:58] <tocka> toxz i know that much :D
[02:00:06] <optraz> systemfault: how do i escape it?
[02:00:06] <systemfault> smarty sux
[02:00:10] <optraz> i tried \ wont work..
[02:00:16] <optraz> tell that to the idiot boss
[02:00:36] <systemfault> optraz: IIRC, there's that {literal} {/literal} crap...
[02:00:39] <systemfault> Not sure though..
[02:01:15] <optraz> systemfault: Exactly, there is this {literal} syntax
[02:01:18] <optraz> so your regex scr3w up
[02:01:29] <optraz> OHH
[02:01:31] <optraz> U MEAN {LITERAL}
[02:01:32] <optraz> LOL
[02:01:34] <optraz> http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.escaping.tpl
[02:01:43] <systemfault> So wrap your whole script tag with it
[02:01:44] <optraz> foolish me
[02:01:45] <systemfault> Yeah...
[02:01:53] <systemfault> :)
[02:01:56] <systemfault> Meh..
[02:01:59] <systemfault> Smarty sux :D
[02:02:07] <optraz> systemfault: understood
[02:02:07] <optraz> thanks
[02:02:09] <optraz> i try now
[02:02:42] <systemfault> Another reason to not put JS into your html ;)
[02:04:53] <systemfault> optraz: Sorry… 5am, gotta sleep :/
[02:04:55] <systemfault> Good luck
[02:09:03] <toxz> how can i check if an element is a text input? any idea?
[02:09:30] <blackspotwiggins> toxz, .is()
[02:12:08] <toxz> blackspotwiggins - thx
[02:22:36] <JeremieDeNoob> i have two jqgrids that id like to add using   <?php include ("php/gridTask.php");?> ... problem is only one of them shows up...i think they are overlapping, each works well individually
[02:22:40] <JeremieDeNoob> any ideas?
[02:22:48] <JeremieDeNoob> how would i prevent them from overlapping
[02:26:00] <NodeX> probably some sort of float
[02:26:06] <NodeX> without seeing your code it's hard to say
[02:27:21] <Chel> is this a place where i can ask about jquery.datepicker ?
[02:39:55] <tocka> Alright, strange thing
[02:42:48] <guy> is http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/ deprecated?
[02:43:23] <phil-adept> hi all. Anyone know where I can find documentation on jquery ui slider's custom handle feature? I can'#t seem to find out how to center the custom handle?
[02:43:51] <tocka> As I said earlyer im using jquery validation plugin and im checking is username valid, but for some reason after the first registration I had to restart the browser because I couldnt get any kind of response, now I noticed 1 thing, if I am changing the URL to the file like  [1 First Registration => File URL: pages/bla/check.php] [2 ND Registration => File URL: http://url.com/pages/bla/check.php]
[02:43:51] <tocka> then it works fine
[02:44:02] <tocka> maybe anyone has an idea why is this happening?
[02:51:48] <mazzachre> Is there a sort of "industry std" agreed on select enhancement for adding styling to select boxes? Or do everyone still write their own?
[02:56:35] <Nece228> hello

[03:14:03] <newbiee> can i place cursor in betwen <b></b> after i have put them in textbox upon keypress
[03:15:05] <Nece228> jsfiddle is lagging
[03:15:56] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/Zjcnw/
[03:16:00] <Nece228> heres a code
[03:16:44] <Nece228> i need that after up or down button press, not only the td should be moved, but the name attribute should also change accordinally
[03:16:47] <dr0id> jQuery 2.0 (early 2013, not long after 1.9): This version will support the same APIs as jQuery 1.9 does, but removes support for IE 6/7/8 oddities such as borked event model, IE7 “attroperties”, HTML5 shims, etc. yay \o/
[03:17:43] <Nece228> like if press move up, and then td moves it should have same name attribute value as the previous one
[03:17:58] <Nece228> i mean previous td
[03:18:29] <Nece228> you get what i mean
[03:19:10] <Nece228> they should exchange
[03:19:21] <Nece228> and this is killing me three days, cant figure out
[03:21:02] <NodeX> td name?
[03:21:53] <Nece228> NodeX: so i have to declare td name?
[03:22:51] <NodeX> I dont know what you want to achieve
[03:22:52] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/Zjcnw/2/
[03:23:55] <NodeX> try that ^^
[03:24:37] <Nece228> NodeX: when i move tr i also need to move its input[name] content
[03:25:03] <Nece228> preventing default isnt what i need now
[03:25:17] <NodeX> dude, what I did does what you asked
[03:25:24] <NodeX> preventing default is EXACTLY what you needed
[03:25:34] <NodeX> because clicking the button was submitting the FORM
[03:25:40] <Nece228> well ok
[03:25:42] <NodeX> thus resetting it back to it's original state
[03:25:50] <Nece228> but its not what i need
[03:26:04] <NodeX> oki doki
[03:26:06] <NodeX> good luck
[03:26:34] <Nece228> press the button up on the lower tr
[03:26:45] <Nece228> before that you can type something in it
[03:26:49] <Nece228> to distinguish it
[03:26:57] <NodeX> I did and did and it works fine
[03:27:14] <Nece228> then inspect elements
[03:27:34] <NodeX> again I did and did and it moves the WHOLE TABLE ROW up or down
[03:27:40] <NodeX> including it's contents
[03:27:49] <Nece228> yes it moves its content
[03:28:01] <Nece228> but i dont want it to move attribute called name
[03:28:44] <NodeX> then you have to remove the attribute
[03:28:57] <Nece228> everything should be moved except the name attribute in the input
[03:29:15] <NodeX> what do you want done with the name attribute ?
[03:29:16] <Nece228> i dont need to remove it because later i submit the form to server
[03:29:25] <ruby_on_tails> hmmm.....
[03:29:34] <NodeX> well what should be done with it then?
[03:30:10] <Nece228> when i interact with up or down buttons all content should be moved up/down except for input 'name' attribute
[03:30:20] <Nece228> it shouldnt be touched
[03:31:09] <ruby_on_tails> move everything up, and move back the name input down
[03:31:10] <NodeX> that makes no sense at all
[03:31:32] <ruby_on_tails> why not ?
[03:32:06] <Nece228> say first row input name is name="1" and second row input name is name="2"
[03:32:11] <Nece228> when i move second row up
[03:32:17] <Nece228> it moves in first place
[03:32:35] <Nece228> and the first row name is name="2"
[03:32:51] <Nece228> while actually it should be name="1"
[03:33:05] <ruby_on_tails> in that case after changing the rows, regenerate the names of all inputs ?
[03:33:25] <Nece228> yes thats what im trying to do
[03:33:30] <Nece228> and cant figure this out
[03:33:59] <NodeX> you'll needto loop the table rows and go thru each one
[03:34:20] <NodeX> you're much better off doing it serverside when the form is submitted seeing as it sends them in order anyway
[03:34:57] <Nece228> but those are mysql entries
[03:35:11] <diverdude> Anybody knows some good RSS feeds concerning web tech discussions which are regularly updated?
[03:35:14] <Nece228> and the name attribute e.g. name="name[1, 3]" shows their id in mysql
[03:35:30] <Nece228> i cant do that
[03:35:51] <NodeX> if you can do it clientside then you can do it serverside
[03:37:01] <blackspotwiggins> yayyy bot

[03:39:57] <TheresaJayne> ?
[03:40:19] <TheresaJayne> question is it written in jquery?
[03:40:52] <NodeX> probs not
[03:41:04] <NodeX> might be written in javascript though
[03:41:07] <TheresaJayne> i know the one in ##java is though
[03:41:17] <TheresaJayne> written in java that is
[03:41:36] <TheresaJayne> and ##csharp doesnt have a bot
[03:42:32] <NodeX> they're mostly TCL, Javascript, python
[03:42:37] <newbiee> i want to place cursor between <b> </b> inside the tag after inserting it in input box..any idea?
[03:43:00] <NodeX> newbiee : thats's javasacript specific
[03:43:14] * TheresaJayne sees visions of Adventured in agile development in c# floating
[03:43:19] <blackspotwiggins> newbiee, you cant have <b> inside an input
[03:43:41] <TheresaJayne> newbiee thats the premise of the agile c# book from ron jeffries
[03:43:43] <newbiee> but i have done so..when i press ctrl+b in keyboard <b></b> gets appended to the input box
[03:43:47] <TheresaJayne> making an xml editor
[03:44:00] <NodeX> you can have the string but it wont bold anythgin
[03:44:11] <newbiee> its so that when anything is saved between that tag it will bold when retrieving from database
[03:44:16] <TheresaJayne> NodeX it depends what he does with it after
[03:44:26] <newbiee> i can able to bold the text also
[03:44:47] <newbiee> the only thing i need to do is once that tag is appended in input box..place cursor in between
[03:45:07] <TheresaJayne> in other words you want to control the cursor position in the input box
[03:45:21] <TheresaJayne> i know this great site that might help you,
[03:45:27] <newbiee> yes
[03:45:41] <newbiee> specifically when tags for bold, italic or underline are appended to input box
[03:46:46] <TheresaJayne> newbiee that amazing site is here http://bit.ly/NJqMDH
[03:47:44] <NodeX> [11:44:02] <TheresaJayne> NodeX it depends what he does with it after <--------- false
[03:47:58] <NodeX> there is no depending anythign, it will put the string in there period
[03:48:27] <TheresaJayne> huh! he saves it into a db, then parses it out later where it will display correctly as he is doing it out correctly.
[03:48:32] <blackspotwiggins> newbiee, be sure to make it xss secure
[03:48:54] <newbiee> ok
[03:49:47] <newbiee> ]looked into both the amazing sites
[03:51:14] <newbiee> in both they use number for range but i am hoping to find sth similar to using regex expression
[03:52:10] <TheresaJayne> if you are appending why cant you do stringlength - length of close tag
[03:52:40] <newbiee> by length of close tag u mean length of </b>

[04:26:28] <k1t> hey folks, i have an object (widgetLayer) and I can't find my way to the array of objects (widgets), could anyone point me in the right direction please? http://theoryplus.com/u/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-29%20at%204.20.21%20AM.png
[04:26:33] <guy> simple code, though how do I append the batch without the wrapping <div />?
[04:27:02] <k1t> i can see it in console.log inspection of object, just cant get to it programmatically
[04:28:18] <k1t> sorry if its a little off topic, i guess its a little more JS and not jquery, excuse me
[04:28:43] <xec> guy: .append(batch.html) ?
[04:28:46] <blackspotwiggins> k1t, object.widgets not working?
[04:28:52] <xec> .html()*
[04:28:56] <k1t> blackspotwiggins: correct
[04:29:19] <guy> xec: $('.entries-favourite .entries').append(batch.children());
[04:29:22] <guy> is the answer.
[04:29:30] <blackspotwiggins> k1t, care to elaborate?
[04:29:40] <xec> guy: that would work too :)
[04:30:21] <k1t> blackspotwiggins: you know what, i see them know
[04:30:28] <k1t> i must have been being an airhead lol
[04:30:38] <k1t> ty anyways though
[04:30:44] <k1t> now*
[04:31:04] <k1t> I was trying to access .widgets before they were there

[04:40:13] <jarco> $('.randomclass').addClass( );  When you have this code, how can you select the elements parent between the brackets from addclass?
[04:41:24] <TheresaJayne> wouldnt that be $('.randomclass').parent('sometag').addClass()
[04:42:05] <TheresaJayne> i have code on a img within an li to get the parent li
[04:42:56] <jarco> What i actually try to do is to add a class to .randomclass  that is the content of the .prev of the parent
[04:43:13] <jarco> I am new to jquery and js so I might be missing something here
[04:44:10] <TheresaJayne> $('.randomclass).AddClass($('.randomclass').parent().attr("class"))
[04:44:13] <TheresaJayne> wouldnt that work
[04:44:17] <TheresaJayne> or something similar
[04:44:50] <jarco> the class to add is actually the .textfrom the parents prev
[04:45:01] <jarco> wait. I ll make something to show it better
[04:47:20] <TheresaJayne> jarco cant you work it out from what i pasted
[04:47:40] <TheresaJayne> rather than .attr() you would put .text()
[04:47:55] <TheresaJayne> or .text-content()
[04:47:59] <TheresaJayne> or something
[04:48:24] <jarco> http://jsfiddle.net/NyQf4/1/
[04:48:25] <TheresaJayne> or do you want us to do everything
[04:49:05] <jarco> i don't need you to do anything. I was just asking for help and I told you i would explain my problem better (i tried to do that with the fiffle)
[04:49:43] <jarco> fiddle *
[04:49:55] <Pallet> hi all http://pastebin.com/cT8JT8bK
[04:50:20] <Pallet> can someone have a look at this and tell me why I'm doing it wrong
[04:50:25] <Pallet> (I know it's a table)
[04:51:15] <TheresaJayne> jarco how about this
[04:51:17] <TheresaJayne> $("li").AddClass($(this).parent("li").text();
[04:54:06] <jarco> doesnt seem to work
[04:54:13] <jarco> I am trying some changes to it
[04:54:25] <TheresaJayne> if you get stuck put alerts in
[04:54:31] <TheresaJayne> see what you are getting back
[04:54:57] <jarco> ok
[04:55:14] <jarco> isnt it so that the li is not actually the parent? That is why was trying to work with prev
[04:55:47] <TheresaJayne> well, thats why you use parent('tag')
[04:55:58] <TheresaJayne> that goes up until it finds that tag
[04:56:03] <TheresaJayne> or should
[04:56:46] <TheresaJayne> Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .parent() method allows us to search through the parents of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements.
[04:57:14] <jarco> yes i understand that
[04:57:20] <jarco> but the li is not its parent
[04:57:30] <TheresaJayne> no its the grandparent
[04:57:33] <jarco> its direct parents are an ul and another ul
[04:58:17] <Nece228> is this valid?
[04:58:18] <Nece228> $(this).find([name])
[04:58:55] <TheresaJayne> .parent().get(0)
[04:59:03] <TheresaJayne> try changing it like that
[04:59:22] <TheresaJayne> so .parent('li').get(0).text()
[05:00:40] <jarco> undefined
[05:02:28] <TheresaJayne> maybe you need something else
[05:02:34] <TheresaJayne> google and look
[05:02:45] <TheresaJayne> thats all i am doing
[05:02:53] <jarco> ok
[05:02:59] <jarco> thanks for helping me on my way
[05:03:22] <jarco> really appreciate it
[05:03:30] <TheresaJayne> jarco you are welcome, i saw my first ever JQuery about 3 weeks ago
[05:03:42] <jarco> mine is today :)
[05:03:47] <TheresaJayne> after 18 years as a Java/.net developer
[05:03:54] <jarco> but it seems cool and I think its not so hard to learn the basics
[05:04:07] <TheresaJayne> oh i have made a few errors
[05:04:19] <TheresaJayne> i did a nice sample code
[05:04:25] <TheresaJayne> let me fiddle it
[05:04:31] <jarco> k
[05:04:40] <seutje> syntax error :(
[05:04:46] <seutje> upsie
[05:04:48] <seutje> mt
[05:05:13] <Nece228> is this valid? $($rowid).find(['name']);
[05:05:22] <Nece228> is it gonna search for attribute name?
[05:05:32] <TheresaJayne> jarco https://gist.github.com/3017581
[05:05:39] <seutje> Nece228: ur quotes are off
[05:05:44] <seutje> ur passing an array with a string
[05:05:59] <seutje> are you looking for ('[name]')?
[05:06:27] <Nece228> the name is actually attribute
[05:06:34] <Nece228> <input name="stuff">
[05:07:26] <TheresaJayne> then wouldnt that be $(rowid[name=name])
[05:07:42] <seutje> er, no
[05:07:46] <TheresaJayne> (with appropriate quotes added)
[05:08:08] <Nece228> hmm what if i dont know the attribute value?
[05:08:09] <jayflux> isnt it a bit soon for jQuery 2.0 to drop IE8 support?
[05:08:11] <seutje> then, still no
[05:08:57] <seutje> Nece228: if $rowid is an ID (including the #) and the attribute ur trying to match is name, $($rowid).find('[name]') should do
[05:09:27] <seutje> please provide more information if my assumptions were incorrect
[05:09:44] <TheresaJayne> seutje well the example i saw was as follows $('div[id]')
[05:09:59] <blackspotwiggins> jayflux, nah its cool. 1.9 will still be around anyhow
[05:10:00] <jarco> TheresaJayne: i did a few things with animate like you as well. I cant actually see the result since i dont have the images
[05:10:07] <Nece228> well, $rowid is actually a tr which has tds in which there are inputs which have attribute called name
[05:10:33] <seutje> Nece228: if $rowid is already a jquery object with a collection of elements, just run find right on that
[05:10:33] <jayflux> blackspotwiggins: i hope so, IE8 is still the most used browser. You should give it at least another 2 years before thinking of dropping support for it. Early 2013 is far to early.
[05:10:34] <TheresaJayne> jarco then change the image path to an image you have
[05:10:47] <seutje> Nece228: $rowid.find('[name]')
[05:10:56] <Nece228> ok thats what i did
[05:10:56] <TheresaJayne> its just a "bubble frame look"
[05:10:59] <Nece228> it outputs me objects
[05:11:11] <seutje> Nece228: what is it you want from these elements?
[05:11:39] <seutje> because find() just returns a jQuery object containing the matched elements
[05:11:44] <blackspotwiggins> jayflux, most used? really?
[05:11:45] <Nece228> basically i want to search and select all attributes called name from anywhere
[05:11:58] <seutje> Nece228: and you want the value of this attribute?
[05:12:02] <TheresaJayne> jarco it looked like the bubble on here http://divcloud.com/wp-content/themes/cloudy1/thumbnails/timthumb.php?src=http://divcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/coda-bubble-using-jquery.jpg&w=250&h=250&q=90&op=jpeg&zc=1
[05:12:34] <jayflux> blackspotwiggins: http://gs.statcounter.com/
[05:12:54] <blackspotwiggins> jayflux, "Sorry, could not understand url: #browser-ww-monthly-201105-201205" :(
[05:13:12] <Nece228> seutje: yes i wants values of these attributes, and later to paste these values in other place
[05:13:40] <blackspotwiggins> ah nm
[05:13:50] <blackspotwiggins> anyway
[05:13:56] <seutje> Nece228: var values = []; $rowid.find('[name]').each(function() { values.push(this.getAttribute('name)); });
[05:14:04] <blackspotwiggins> jayflux, http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-201105-201205 would indicate that chrome 18 is most used
[05:14:15] <seutje> Nece228: I'm assuming there's more than one match in $rowid
[05:14:26] <jarco> awesome :)
[05:14:30] <jayflux> blackspotwiggins:  you can't really ignore the fact that IE8 is still a huge chunk of usability
[05:14:35] <Nece228> seutje: yes, thanks ill try to implement it
[05:14:46] <seutje> otherwise you can drop the each and the pushing in an array and just drop it in a var as a regular string or something
[05:14:50] <blackspotwiggins> jayflux, http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201105-201205 is even more convincing IMO
[05:14:59] <blackspotwiggins> even ie9 beats it
[05:15:00] <blackspotwiggins> so..
[05:15:19] <seutje> happy days!
[05:15:19] <blackspotwiggins> i dont think its a big deal
[05:15:34] <blackspotwiggins> most jquery sites are never getting updated to 2.0 anyway
[05:15:49] <blackspotwiggins> and there is always option of using 1.9 if you need to support legacy ie
[05:16:23] <seutje> "most sites never get updated" FTFY
[05:16:52] <blackspotwiggins> yeah maybe
[05:16:54] <xec> what does FTFY mean?
[05:16:58] <blackspotwiggins> fixed that for you
[05:17:03] <xec> right
[05:17:30] <seutje> I make drupal sites, just trust me on this one ;)
[05:17:36] <blackspotwiggins> jq 1.4 ftw
[05:17:44] <blackspotwiggins> or is it newer now
[05:17:49] <seutje> ?instantrimshot
[05:17:54] <blackspotwiggins> it used to be 1.3 even
[05:18:01] <seutje> 1.2.6 in D5 iirc
[05:18:09] <seutje> good times, good stuff
[05:18:39] <seutje> D8 should be largely decoupled from jQuery though
[05:18:54] <seutje> in theory, u'd be able to swap it with, say... zepto
[05:19:02] <seutje> it'll prolly break a ton of things though :D
[05:20:56] <blackspotwiggins> whoa
[05:20:58] <blackspotwiggins> 1.2
[05:21:02] <blackspotwiggins> really old school
[05:21:34] <seutje> keepin it real since jan 15 2007
[05:22:25] <seutje> the dawn of the awkward behaviors
[05:23:08] <TheresaJayne> i am just ripping 1.2 out of old code at the moment
[05:23:52] <TheresaJayne> i hate working in .net 1.1 vb.net
[05:24:45] <seutje> "I hate .net" FTFY
[05:25:38] <TheresaJayne> seutje to be honest for apps its easy to make stuff look nice
[05:25:49] <TheresaJayne> specially in c#
[05:26:05] <seutje> oh I wasn't necessarily talking about developing in .NET
[05:26:44] <TheresaJayne> well i am originally a java dev
[05:29:41] <seutje> java seems less hate-inducing, but its still quite far up there in my book
[05:30:04] <SkiOne> I need a little help troubleshooting, in this code snippet if I put an alert in $('.del').click is pops up but the the dialog doesn't http://pastebin.ca/2165529
[05:30:26] <SkiOne> there are no js errors in the console
[05:30:32] <seutje> not sure how many ppl I've had to help get their JRE going, but more than a handful
[05:30:38] <mprentice> java has some killer frameworks, and clojure makes it a joy to program in (i've heard people quite like scala too)
[05:31:01] <computer2000> can anyone recommend some possibility to draw a progressbar based on a number?
[05:31:40] <SkiOne> computer2000: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Progressbar
[05:31:47] <computer2000> SkiOne: thx
[05:31:47] <seutje> SkiOne: .data returns the value that was set iirc
[05:31:55] <mprentice> computer2000: http://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+progress+bar+example
[05:32:34] <SkiOne> seutje: data is either OK or ERROR based on the results of posting to /index.php/site/delCustomer
[05:32:45] <seutje> SkiOne: ergo, .data doesn't return the jQuery object with the element set, so you can't call jQuery methods on it
[05:32:53] <mprentice> computer2000: full example: http://sebastienayotte.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/a-progress-bar-example-with-jquery/
[05:32:56] <seutje> ?data @ SkiOne
[05:33:07] <computer2000> mprentice: thx man
[05:33:24] <seutje> SkiOne: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ -> "Returns the value that was set."
[05:33:45] <seutje> not sure why that doesn't throw an error though
[05:34:02] <seutje> you're essentially doing ('foo').dialog("open")
[05:34:13] <SkiOne> yes
[05:34:55] <seutje> SkiOne: so your intention is to run dialog on a regular string?
[05:35:11] <SkiOne> if I remove the ajax call and just replace it with this.close it still silently fails
[05:35:27] <seutje> oh, I was looking at the delete thing
[05:36:21] <SkiOne> seutje: this snippet lists a bunch of "customers" with hyper links (edit, del, view,) when you click del it should delete the subscriber, I want a confirmation dialog to pop up and ask "are you sure" its code I have in tons of places but here is just not working
[05:37:01] <jarco> What is wrong with this syntax? I tried it to do without the $(this) and addclass and then it selects the correct thing. 		$('.sector ul.latestnews ul li').addClass($(this).parent().prev().text());
[05:37:07] * SkiOne is a moron
[05:37:16] <SkiOne> the id doesn't match
[05:37:36] <SkiOne> customer_del <> confirm_del
[05:37:45] <seutje> oh lol, didn't even notice there was markup in there :x
[05:38:13] <SkiOne> :) anyway thanks, usually just talking it out with someone helps
[05:38:15] <seutje> SkiOne: but in that bottom click handler, is that dialog call working properly?
[05:38:23] <SkiOne> yes
[05:38:30] <SkiOne> it all works now
[05:38:48] <SkiOne> there is a hidden div with the dialog text (using the UI plugin)
[05:39:29] <bindi_> $('#comments').append(line).hide().show("slow"); <- I tried this to add something with an animation, but it didnt work. how can I do this?
[05:40:07] <SkiOne> you have a hide and show in the same statement?
[05:40:24] <SkiOne> hide('slow')?
[05:40:35] <blackspotwiggins> bindi_, you prolly want to show() the line, not comments itself?
[05:40:45] <bindi_> yes
[05:41:26] <bindi_> i don't have any display: none in the css though
[05:41:44] <bindi_> because I retrieve the comments on load and I don't want any animations then
[05:41:53] <SkiOne> bindi_: setting something to hide sets display now doesn't it?
[05:41:59] <SkiOne> *none
[05:42:31] <bindi_> I guess? :p
[05:42:41] <bindi_> what I had didn't work though, should it have?
[05:42:58] <SkiOne> I don't think so cause you have a hide and show in the same statement it just looks wrong
[05:43:07] <SkiOne> are you trying to hide or show the comment?
[05:43:12] <bindi_> lol, show
[05:43:32] <SkiOne> try taking out the hide()
[05:43:38] <xec> i'm guessing he's trying to make sure it's hidden before doing the .show("slow")
[05:43:58] <SkiOne> xec: yea maybe but would that work?
[05:44:02] <bindi_> already tried that, didn't work
[05:44:08] <xec> SkiOne: i don't see why not tbh
[05:44:09] <xec> ?demo @ bindi_
[05:44:15] <SkiOne> I guess
[05:44:27] <xec> bindi_: make a quick demo in jsfiddle.net ?
[05:44:37] <SkiOne> bindi_:  console.log(line) in your code
[05:44:55] <blackspotwiggins> bindi_, maybe then call .show() on line, not comments
[05:45:02] <bindi_> you guys want to see the site i'm working on instead? :p
[05:45:45] <xec> bindi_: blackspotwiggins is right, are you trying to show the line or the #comment?
[05:46:06] <bindi_> oh, didnt I reply to that already? D:
[05:46:07] <bindi_> the line
[05:46:07] <SkiOne> it looks ilke he is trying to append line to comments
[05:46:08] <seutje> $(line).css('opacity', '0').appendTo('#comments').show('slow')
[05:46:21] <seutje> if line is already a jQuery object, omit the $()
[05:46:56] <bindi_> didnt seem to work :p
[05:47:46] <seutje> ?code @ bindi_
[05:47:49] <bindi_> sec
[05:47:51] <TheresaJayne> jarco did you get my code to work?
[05:47:58] <xec> jarco: there's no way we can tell you what's wrong without knowing exactly what you're trying to do, which involves your html. make a demo?
[05:48:19] <fuchstronaut> is .htaccess less secure than sessions?
[05:48:35] <fuchstronaut> i know this is not really jquery related ;-)
[05:48:39] <seutje> don't they serve a different purpose?
[05:48:48] <fuchstronaut> seutje: they do, both are fine for me
[05:48:51] <blackspotwiggins> fuchstronaut, is the banana more straight than a rainforest?
[05:48:58] <seutje> haha :')
[05:49:00] <fuchstronaut> blackspotwiggins: absolutely
[05:49:09] <blackspotwiggins> then yes, absolutely to you too, good sir
[05:49:30] <bindi_> http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/ here's my awesome code
[05:49:32] <fuchstronaut> i actually never really used .htaccess, but for my purpose it would be enough and less work to do
[05:49:42] <fuchstronaut> so i wonder if there are any flaws that come with it i dont know about
[05:51:16] <seutje> bindi_: whoa, sorry, but I'ma just walk away from this monster :|
[05:52:02] <SkiOne> fuchstronaut: htaccess for what it does is fine
[05:52:10] <TheresaJayne> too much rain around
[05:52:15] <bindi_> seutje: what's the problem? :D
[05:52:21] <fuchstronaut> SkiOne: thank you, sir.
[05:52:22] <SkiOne> its a bit more secure to put it into the conf file but other than that its fine
[05:52:32] <TheresaJayne> all these people being killed off through excess flood
[05:52:39] <fuchstronaut> i would actually put it outside the webservers root dir
[05:52:50] <SkiOne> fuchstronaut: but like what has already been said sessions have nothing to do with htacess
[05:52:57] <fuchstronaut> i know
[05:53:02] <SkiOne> fuchstronaut: you can't it has to be in docroot to work
[05:53:08] <fuchstronaut> oh
[05:53:09] <fuchstronaut> well
[05:53:11] <SkiOne> what are you trying to do?
[05:53:17] <fuchstronaut> all i need to do is protect one single file
[05:53:21] <fuchstronaut> for one single user
[05:53:22] <fuchstronaut> so
[05:53:25] <fuchstronaut> htaccess would be great
[05:53:29] <SkiOne> so you want to put basic auth on a file?
[05:53:32] <fuchstronaut> yes
[05:53:34] <jarco> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/NyQf4/1/ This is what I want to do
[05:53:36] <blackspotwiggins> thats htpasswd
[05:53:39] <blackspotwiggins> not htaccess
[05:53:43] <fuchstronaut> uhm
[05:53:44] <SkiOne> you need both
[05:53:45] <seutje> bindi_: besides global namespace pollution, indescriptive function/variable names, endless repetition and gigantic blocks of markup... not much, I suppose
[05:53:47] <fuchstronaut> yeah
[05:53:49] <fuchstronaut> thats what i ment
[05:53:58] <SkiOne> I have a link hold on
[05:53:58] <swe_ET> is there a way to stop click event to fire when user doubleclicks element?
[05:54:00] <bindi_> seutje: do advice how to fix this :p
[05:54:06] <seutje> oh, and empty catch statements
[05:54:10] <blackspotwiggins> htaccess has many other purposes
[05:54:24] <SkiOne> http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/auth.html
[05:54:28] <fuchstronaut> blackspotwiggins: thats right, my fault, I want htacess
[05:54:36] <fuchstronaut> SkiOne: thanks
[05:54:43] <fuchstronaut> I'll go with htaccess/htpaswd
[05:55:02] <seutje> bindi_: sorry, this is beyond my abilities
[05:55:59] <fuchstronaut> swe_ET: I dont know if there is an out-of-the-box solution (but i think there is on dblclick in jQuery), but you could bind an event to click, set a flag and than wait a number of milliseconds to see if the element got clicked again
[05:56:31] <bindi_> seutje: could've just remained silent alltogether then :)
[05:56:38] <blackspotwiggins> you cant really stop browser from firing events
[05:56:56] <SkiOne> bindi_: he was trying to help
[05:57:10] <bindi_> didnt seem so
[05:57:41] <SkiOne> the problem is you haven't really provided enough info
[05:57:57] <swe_ET> fuchstronaut: thnx.. perhaps it vas extJs that had something out-of-the-box
[05:58:54] <fuchstronaut> what editors are you guys using on windows?
[05:59:58] <seutje> bindi_: sorry, I assumed it would be considered rude to ask for more info and then not reply at all when said info is provided, you might get the impression I'm looking into it and trying to fix it or whatever
[06:00:30] <bindi_> got a bit busy now, i'll be back later and explain it all properly then :p
[06:00:38] <amitprakash> Hi.. Since I can bind a function to a dom element as $(selector).bind('trigger', function); .. is it possible to find out given a selector if such a trigger is bound to it?
[06:00:47] <fuchstronaut> seutje: you are just a mean guy...
[06:01:23] <fuchstronaut> amitprakash: you can give your event a name using namespaces
[06:02:17] <fuchstronaut> ?namespaced events
[06:02:24] <fuchstronaut> and nothing happend...
[06:02:45] <amitprakash> fuchstronaut, reading on it anyways :) thanks for the guidance
[06:02:56] <blackspotwiggins> fuchstronaut, i use sublime text 2 on everything
[06:04:56] <fuchstronaut> blackspotwiggins: that looks pretty nice with it's multiple selection thing
[06:04:59] <fuchstronaut> is it free?
[06:05:17] <amitprakash> fuchstronaut, while namespace events does provide context for an event, how can I detect if such an event is attached to a selector
[06:06:00] <blackspotwiggins> fuchstronaut, you can trial it endlessly
[06:06:07] <blackspotwiggins> otherwise, 50$ or 60$
[06:06:28] <fuchstronaut> hm, thats sometihng i dont understand, I can trial it endlessly? I mean it's nice from a user standpoint ;)
[06:06:37] <blackspotwiggins> well yea
[06:06:47] <blackspotwiggins> he expects people to pay for it if they like it
[06:06:56] <blackspotwiggins> its not worth it to try to stop the pirates anyway IMO
[06:07:48] <fuchstronaut> blackspotwiggins: yeah thats true
[06:08:10] <fuchstronaut> actually if you are developer yourself you are more keen to pay for great products
[06:09:06] <blackspotwiggins> fuchstronaut, im gonna buy a license now that 2.0 is officially out
[06:09:16] <blackspotwiggins> it's the best editor i've ever used
[06:09:39] <fuchstronaut> amitprakash: I don't know a solution in jQuery for this, but there might be eventListener plugins out there
[06:09:50] <fuchstronaut> or you can simply set flags by your self if possible
[06:10:21] <blackspotwiggins> amitprakash, you can access the events with .data("events") iirc
[06:10:24] <blackspotwiggins> or maybe .events()
[06:10:36] <seutje> fuchstronaut: iTry
[06:10:54] <fuchstronaut> i think all jQuery related data is preceeded by an underscore _
[06:11:43] <amitprakash> blackspotwiggins, yeah.. thats what I am doing now .. type($(selector).data('events').event_I_am_looking_for) == undefined
[06:11:48] <amitprakash> is there a better way ?
[06:12:05] <blackspotwiggins> well
[06:12:18] <blackspotwiggins> you can omit ==undefined part
[06:12:52] <blackspotwiggins> if (!$(something).data('events')[eventname]) { yay no event }
[06:13:00] <amitprakash> oh yay
[06:13:04] <amitprakash> thanks a lot blackspotwiggins
[06:24:01] <Cryp71c> Is anyone familiar with known issues in IE7 with ".data()"? I appear to be consistently getting "Object doesn't support this property"
[06:30:43] <mprentice> do you guys have an opinion between ember and backbone?
[06:38:54] <David___> Hi questions, is there a news list or RSS feed I can join to get accounements concerning new releases of JQuery ?
[06:39:14] <GreekFreak> hi
[06:39:16] <GreekFreak>  why is this not going into my submit function? It worked fine when I simply had it as submit() (FYI this is generated from CoffeeScript)   https://gist.github.com/3017953
[06:43:35] <NodeX> $("aside#add-logo-dialog"); <--- bad
[06:43:54] <NodeX> #id lookups are fast, no need for the "aside"
[06:44:54] <largerthanlife> hi
[06:45:23] <GreekFreak> NodeX, ok. I'll change that. Any idea why it's not going into the submit?
[06:45:29] <largerthanlife> I am using jqpopup in my jsp page and it doesnt open where it should
[06:45:47] <largerthanlife> the other popup opens correctly
[06:46:14] <NodeX> how do you mean "not going" ?
[06:46:57] <GreekFreak> NodeX, If you look at my code, there's a console.log("HERE"). It's not displaying, and no error appears in the console
[06:47:19] <NodeX> does $(".edit_company") exist?
[06:47:40] <NodeX> I should say does it exist ar load time - i.e not ajax content
[06:48:12] <NodeX> ar -> at
[06:49:03] <GreekFreak> NodeX, yes. like I said, it worked fine when I didn't have a function inside the .submit()
[06:49:41] <NodeX> does the ajax request fire ?
[06:50:05] <NodeX> your code is "binding" to the submit of your form
[06:50:23] <NodeX> I imagine you are trying to submit the form with an ajax request ?
[06:50:28] <GreekFreak> it doesn't get that far. It doesn't even display to the console, which is above the ajax
[06:50:34] <GreekFreak> NodeX, indeed I am
[06:50:45] <NodeX> you need to add some things then
[06:50:55] <NodeX> first .. submit(function(event)
[06:51:04] <GreekFreak> ok
[06:51:13] <NodeX> above your console.log() ... event.preventDefault();
[06:51:22] <largerthanlife> http://pastebin.com/QC2uVxa8   THIS is the url ,
[06:51:44] <NodeX> remove the return $().submit(.....
[06:51:48] <largerthanlife> the popup doesnt open in right place though I have copied it from other
[06:51:52] <NodeX> just the "return" part
[06:52:01] <NodeX> I'll re-write it one sec
[06:52:34] <GreekFreak> NodeX, I can't lol, cause it's generated from CoffeeScript
[06:53:38] <NodeX> https://gist.github.com/3018077
[06:55:07] <NodeX> which idiot invented coffeescript lol
[06:55:15] <NodeX> why would anyone ever use such crap
[06:56:05] <GreekFreak> NodeX, lol
[06:56:18] <GreekFreak> NodeX, why did you "unbind('submit') ?
[06:57:12] <NodeX> incase you already had it bound
[06:57:23] <NodeX> i.e second form submission - it would try to send it twice
[06:57:38] <NodeX> because you dont use event delegation to bind your handler you have to do it that way
[06:58:08] <GreekFreak> NodeX, sorry, I'm new at this. what do you mean, "second form submission"
[06:58:30] <NodeX> err submit the form a second, third, fourth, N times
[06:58:45] <GreekFreak> oh ok
[06:58:49] <GreekFreak> still nothing
[06:58:53] <NodeX> if possible I would attack the problem in a different way
[06:59:28] <NodeX> bind with event delegation at page load
[06:59:43] <NodeX> and use your original submit();
[06:59:43] <fuchstronaut> as #httpd seems to be sleeping, can you tell me why my .htaccess file with only one line "deny from all" is causing server 500 errors?
[06:59:56] <NodeX> because apache blocks horse c**k
[07:00:02] <NodeX> blocks -> blows
[07:00:17] <fuchstronaut> well thanks, this is a great point to start
[07:00:19] <blackspotwiggins> fuchstronaut, because thats not the correct synax
[07:00:19] <fuchstronaut> I'll google it
[07:00:27] <GreekFreak> NodeX, if it makes any difference, I'm using Rails lol
[07:00:43] <NodeX> deny all; iirc
[07:00:44] <fuchstronaut> blackspotwiggins: how do i do it right? i thought anything inside my htaccess file is wrapped in <directory>
[07:01:09] <NodeX> can you get your rails to write a javascript function GreekFreak ?
[07:01:46] <blackspotwiggins> fuchstronaut, isnt it supposed to be capitalized?
[07:01:53] <fuchstronaut> oh
[07:01:54] <fuchstronaut> hm
[07:01:56] <blackspotwiggins> otherwise, check your error.log
[07:02:05] <blackspotwiggins> maybe the module is not loaded
[07:02:12] <GreekFreak> NodeX, unfortunately not lol
[07:02:21] <fuchstronaut> its loaded, im just stupid
[07:02:49] <NodeX> well how did you get that function written then?
[07:02:51] <fuchstronaut> ok uppercase doesnt work, removing the "from" doesnt work either
[07:03:03] <GreekFreak> NodeX, I've simplified it to this: https://gist.github.com/3018147
[07:03:21] <GreekFreak> NodeX, I wrote it myself based on some answer on stack exchange
[07:03:29] <NodeX> Deny from all;
[07:03:34] <GreekFreak> well, copied it lol
[07:03:38] <NodeX> sorry, nginx is "deny all;"
[07:03:57] <NodeX> GreekFreak : so why can't you write another function ?
[07:04:34] <fuchstronaut> adding ; at the end doesnt work either
[07:04:37] <fuchstronaut> hmm
[07:04:43] <fuchstronaut> google says it should work
[07:04:58] <blackspotwiggins> so
[07:04:58] <fuchstronaut> can this be turned off somehow?
[07:05:02] <fuchstronaut> because passwd stuff works
[07:05:03] <blackspotwiggins> not checking error.log?
[07:05:05] <GreekFreak> NodeX, ok, let me go a step back. What did you mean "bind at even delegation"? I know what delegation is, but don't know when it happens
[07:05:07] <blackspotwiggins> is that some kind of macho thing?
[07:05:17] <fuchstronaut> if i only knew where it is
[07:05:30] <blackspotwiggins> /var/log/apache2 usually
[07:05:39] <blackspotwiggins> or check your httpd.conf
[07:05:45] <sunbeam> i'd like the main (top menu item) li, that a certain li that has class .current_item is in, to be current_item too, how can i best do this?
[07:05:58] <NodeX> $(document).ready(function(){ $().submit(function(event){   your code here });}) ;
[07:05:59] <GreekFreak> NodeX, I can't understand why it works if I simply go .submit(), but it doesn't when I go .submit(sunction....
[07:06:09] <NodeX> becuase submit() is an action
[07:06:13] <fuchstronaut> blackspotwiggins: sadly i dont know where this stuff is
[07:06:16] <NodeX> and submit(function... is a bind
[07:06:19] <fuchstronaut> screw it, 500 works fine too
[07:06:21] <GreekFreak> oh
[07:06:23] <fuchstronaut> noone can access
[07:07:19] <GreekFreak> NodeX, I take it that $(document).ready(....  is outside the ' (function() {   jQuery(function() { .... } part
[07:07:27] <blackspotwiggins> fuchstronaut, this is why we cant have nice things
[07:07:50] <NodeX> yep
[07:08:00] <blackspotwiggins> put some effort in.. jeez
[07:08:15] <blackspotwiggins> like its so freaking hard to find the log file
[07:08:17] <GreekFreak> and is the '$()' you types supposed to be blank?
[07:08:23] <blackspotwiggins> in fact, just dont use apache ever if you are so lazy..
[07:08:43] <blackspotwiggins> GreekFreak, yes, obviously you bind submit handlers on empty sets..
[07:09:21] <NodeX> I left it blank so you can put whar you want in there
[07:09:28] <Nece228> $($currentrow).val($prevrow)
[07:09:31] <GreekFreak> blackspotwiggins, actually, it's not obvious to me, I'm new at this. I thought they had to be bound to a form element since that is what can be submitted
[07:09:41] <NodeX> in your case it would be '.edit_form' or w/e it was
[07:10:16] <GreekFreak> NodeX, thanks. And then I still call the .submit() as before
[07:10:32] <GreekFreak> blackspotwiggins, nevermind. I just felt even smaller when I realised you were being sarcastic lol
[07:10:54] <NodeX> GreekFreak : yes
[07:11:09] <GreekFreak> NodeX, thanx. trying it now
[07:11:24] <blackspotwiggins> GreekFreak, well take it as a lesson then - computers do things you tell them to do
[07:11:30] <blackspotwiggins> not what you think they should do
[07:11:50] <GreekFreak> blackspotwiggins, lol. you're right
[07:12:19] <NodeX> GreekFreak : the basic jist of it is this ... bind stuff at document load (using delegation) and let everything else feed from that
[07:12:28] <GreekFreak> but in my defense, I thought that it did something in the background that jQuery told it too, that I didn't know about
[07:12:58] <NodeX> submit(function... is just a helper to ... bind('submit',function(...
[07:13:13] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/94169808
[07:13:18] <Nece228> are there any problems
[07:13:20] <NodeX> it's a little confusing to new people beacuse it implies that you want to submit() with this function being ran
[07:13:23] <Nece228> because the code doesnt work
[07:13:44] <sunbeam> i'd like the main (top menu item) li, that a certain li that has class .current_item is in, to be current_item too, how can i best do this?
[07:13:51] <nibblebot> is there a way to conditionally prevent $.ajax from firing success callbacks based on a response w/ status 200 but with some data that makes it actually an error?
[07:13:57] <GreekFreak> NodeX, oh ok. Would I do this only for submits? What else behaves the same? my slideUps  and clicks work fine the way I showed you
[07:14:14] <NodeX> most things behave this way
[07:14:23] <NodeX> click, change, submit, keypress,...
[07:14:29] <blackspotwiggins> nibblebot, it would be better to just return with non-2xx response
[07:14:31] <NodeX> there is a list somewhere
[07:14:45] <nibblebot> blackspotwiggins: working w/ existing api that does not implement it that way
[07:14:58] <blackspotwiggins> doyou control the api?
[07:15:01] <nibblebot> no
[07:15:32] <nibblebot> right now i can do can fire my success/error callbacks manually but i want to just use the promise returned by $.ajax
[07:15:45] <GreekFreak> NodeX, so what do I put inside the jQuery() function?
[07:15:51] <nibblebot> right now it looks like i'll need to wrap $.ajax and manage my own promise
[07:16:04] <blackspotwiggins> nibblebot, you can check the contents in success callback
[07:16:07] <blackspotwiggins> and proceed from there
[07:16:11] <nibblebot> but by then it's too late
[07:16:18] <nibblebot> promise will have resolved successfully
[07:16:22] <blackspotwiggins> well .. not if you check before you do anything
[07:16:29] <t4nkd> Hey jQuery, can someone take a look at this fiddle, and the described problem, and maybe tell me how I'm supposed to fix this? I can't completely understand where I went wrong... http://jsfiddle.net/WnrPg/3/
[07:16:38] <nibblebot> what i'm saying is, i won't be able to use the builtin promise returned by $.ajax
[07:16:48] <blackspotwiggins> yeah.. you cant
[07:16:49] <nibblebot> if i want to parse response before resolving it
[07:17:13] <nibblebot> ok, layer on top of $.ajax it is :)
[07:18:00] <blackspotwiggins> nibblebot, maybe you can use datafilter to mess with it
[07:18:00] <blackspotwiggins> not sure
[07:18:11] <blackspotwiggins> like how invalid json in 200 goes to error
[07:18:36] <nibblebot> yes.. looking into
[07:22:07] <nibblebot> cool, looks like that fires before promise is resolved
[07:24:36] <sunbeam> i'd like the main (top menu item) li, that a certain li that has class .current_item is in, to be current_item too, how can i best do this?
[07:29:53] <bindi_> SkiOne, seutje etc.. I've made it a little prettier now I think
[07:30:43] <bindi_> http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/ here, I wish to append the new comments/replies to the main div with an animation when the comments are retrieved periodically, but not during the initial load
[07:32:34] <bindi_> lines 51 and 66 are the attempts i've had at it, but they aren't added with pretty animations, they just pop up
[07:33:04] <t4nkd> Whenever I click a different 'Use Credits' button after hitting minimize, the text fades out, and then back, I'm not sure where in the creditButtonExpand function I went wrong, can someone take a look at this fiddle please? http://jsfiddle.net/WnrPg/4/
[07:34:03] <sunbeam> how to select the top LI of the sub li ?
[07:41:20] <xec> sunbeam: judging from what you said in #css maybe what you want is something like .parents("ul")
[07:41:32] <sunbeam> xec: ok, will i get the top parent then?
[07:41:35] <sunbeam> the most top parent
[07:41:57] <xec> nope, that will get every ancestor UL
[07:50:10] <Nece228> is naming variables with a dollar sign a good practice generally?
[07:50:47] <asxbr> Nece228: i prefer use jQuery(...). its more compatible.
[07:51:09] <Nece228> hmm im wondering if using that will have some consequences
[07:51:27] <sunbeam> Any idea how i can select the most top li of a sub li?
[07:52:55] <EyePulp> $('li:first) ?
[07:53:47] <EyePulp> er, that's the final selector - getting to that sub list could be done however you like.
[07:56:14] <Wolf_22> Anyone know why alert is coming up null in Firefox 10?
[07:56:28] <Wolf_22> if($(location).attr('href').split("/")[5] == "imce"){
[07:56:29] <Wolf_22> 		alert($("h1.title").html());
[07:56:31] <Wolf_22> 	}
[07:56:59] <EyePulp> Wolf_22: does your h1 have a title attr?
[07:57:03] <Wolf_22> Yep.
[07:57:13] <NodeX> alert($('h1.title').length);
[07:57:23] <EyePulp> try $("h1").attr('title');
[07:57:44] <NodeX> EyePulp : I think he's after a h1 witha  class of title lol
[07:57:53] <EyePulp> er wait,  - sorry
[07:57:53] <NodeX> not the attribute "title"
[07:57:56] <EyePulp> =)
[07:58:01] <NodeX> TFI Friday :)
[07:58:17] * EyePulp was wondering why an h1 would need a title attr
[07:58:25] <NodeX> haha
[07:58:33] <Wolf_22> NodeX: It came back as 0.
[07:58:46] <NodeX> then it didn't find h1.title
[07:59:07] <EyePulp> Wolf_22: go paste your html someplace.
[07:59:09] <NodeX> make sure <h1 class="title"> ... exists
[07:59:25] <Wolf_22> EyePulp: Will do.
[07:59:44] * EyePulp rubs the sleep out of his eyes
[07:59:47] <EyePulp> oy
[08:01:51] <EdwardIII> hey, using something to make placeholders work if ie8/9 are messing with my shiz
[08:01:52] <noaXess> ex
[08:02:09] <EdwardIII> however i think sometimes it gets triggered before all the forms on the page have rendered (some get pulled in via ajax etc)
[08:02:20] <EdwardIII> guess there's not much i can do about that except setTimeout?
[08:02:44] <NodeX> err use on()
[08:02:58] <sunbeam> EyePulp: that would be the first of the ul ?
[08:03:05] <EdwardIII> NodeX: who, me?
[08:03:09] <sunbeam> i want to select the parent top li of the sub li that has currently .current_item
[08:03:22] <EdwardIII> this is the line that triggers the placeholdery: $(function(){ $('input[placeholder], textarea[placeholder]').placeholder(); });
[08:03:42] <EyePulp> paste the html (someplace), and I can tell you.  my html divination skills are lacking this morning
[08:07:45] <t4nkd> Whenever I click a 'Use Credits' element, then minimize, then click a different 'Use Credits' element, the text fades out, and then back in, I'm not sure where in the creditButtonExpand function I went wrong, can someone take a look at this fiddle please? http://jsfiddle.net/WnrPg/4/
[08:09:20] <bindi_> seutje: the opacity thingy you gave to me doesn't work now, it adds the comments but they won't ever show up unless I reload
[08:14:24] <sereal-work> Hello, I am pretty inexperienced with jquery (and javascript). I am trying to make a function that will hide some tables rows. I had done it in prior by hardcoding all the functions. (http://pastebin.com/rNbBiJXZ) This is a dumb way to do it, and not possible to do for how the page is being generated.
[08:15:21] <ravenz> `jqf @ sereal-work
[08:15:21] <evansiegel> I have a quick question about getting the "value" from an array of checkboxes. $('input:checkbox:checked').val(); only returns the value of the first one. Thanks!
[08:15:34] <ravenz> `jqueryfundamentals @ sereal-work
[08:15:44] <ravenz> oh fail
[08:15:48] <ravenz> ?jqf @ sereal-work
[08:16:02] <sereal-work> :P can you just point me to some documentation I might want to take a look at?
[08:16:18] <ravenz> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[08:16:33] <sereal-work> thanks.
[08:16:42] <ravenz> and http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page ofc
[08:18:18] <sunbeam> i want to select the parent top li of the sub li that has currently .current_item, anyone knows how?
[08:19:49] <sereal-work> ravenz, i'm a bit confused - is there a way to have a $("#this") type thing to make it generic?
[08:20:03] <sereal-work> then do a if clause to determine what clicked it?
[08:21:01] <evansiegel> sereal-work, if you want to reference the thing you're working with, you only need $(this), no "" or #/
[08:23:00] <sereal-work> evansiegel, ah thanks.
[08:23:08] <sereal-work> whats the # refer to?
[08:28:51] <asxbr> hi guys... im trying get scroll height of a page. i tried do it using "jQuery('body').prop('scrollHeight');", but its returing me total height of container, not the real height of scroll. Someone know how to get the real height ?
[08:38:10] <Nece228> anyone can explain why fith line doesnt work?
[08:38:12] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/64085649
[08:38:26] <Nece228> actually i think i know why it doesnt work, but im searching for solution
[08:39:12] <evansiegel> I think it's because you need to reference is with the $(/*your thing here*/). I was just having a similar problem.
[08:39:28] <evansiegel> Wait, maybe not.
[08:41:24] <NodeX> dude ... finding #id's is pointeless
[08:41:42] <NodeX> they are optimised and MUST be unique
[08:42:07] <Woet> use a class if you want multiple
[08:42:30] <Nece228> yeah i know
[08:42:34] <Nece228> but class is already in use
[08:43:12] <jedimind> i disagree
[08:43:20] <jedimind> ive seen it, and i can tell you that there was no class whatsoever
[08:43:59] <Nece228> you dont see because you didnt see my full code
[08:44:07] <Nece228> first off explain why it doesnt work?
[08:46:51] <relipse> how can i access a name with "[" and "]" in the name...this does not work: $('input[name=product[inventory_quantity]]').val()
[08:48:10] <t4nkd> Is there a function to return the bound events on an element object?
[08:48:37] <Haprog> relipse: try name="product.."
[08:51:26] <relipse> Haprog: you mean use "." instead of "[" or "]" ?
[08:51:43] <relipse> oh you mena use a quote "
[08:51:44] <Haprog> no
[08:51:46] <Haprog> ise quotes
[08:51:52] <Haprog> *use
[08:52:11] <Haprog>  if you use single quotes around the string try double quotes inside
[08:52:34] <Haprog> not 100% sure if that works with [] though
[08:52:42] <relipse> yeah it is giving me undefined
[08:52:46] <relipse> (not an error)
[08:53:36] <NoiseEee> relipse: $('input[name="product[inventory_quantity]"]').val()
[08:53:40] <Haprog> I dunno then
[08:53:43] <relipse> oh nevermind, that worked
[08:53:46] <relipse> i was testing the wrong page
[08:54:02] <relipse> thanks NoiseEee and Haprog
[08:54:05] <Haprog> ok, nice
[08:55:40] <surfdue> Whats the best way to delay $(selector).each and allow each function to complete before continuing?
[08:56:20] <geoff__> using a queue?
[08:57:39] <surfdue> geoff__: so queue the function inside the each and then unqueue on the callback of my .getJSON?
[08:58:49] <geoff__> this is what I had in mind: http://ricostacruz.com/backbone-patterns/#animation_buffer
[08:59:01] <geoff__> the Buffer
[08:59:27] <geoff__> you just add functions to the buffer and execute one by one once you've added them all up
[08:59:45] <geoff__> it works well for animatios
[08:59:50] <geoff__> *animations
[09:03:12] <SmartTowel> is there a way to make the jquery grid plugin only editable if you are an admin?

[09:07:24] <zulu-gula> does .live() works in jquery 1.2.6?
[09:08:30] <EyePulp> zulu-gula: http://api.jquery.com/live/   <-- where does that list it being added?
[09:09:04] <geoff__> tl;dr: NO
[09:09:07] <zulu-gula> EyePulp:  ah, I see now, that there is "version added" - didn's spot it, tx
[09:09:17] <NoiseEee> zulu-gula: really, a 4 year old version of jquery?
[09:09:29] <NoiseEee> just something to consider.

[09:27:02] <knapper_tech> anyone know a good strategy for getting the header and footer to not reload in jqmobile?
[09:28:58] <t4nkd> Can someone explain to me how my creditButtonExpand function fires twice after using the creditButtonCollapse event? http://jsfiddle.net/WnrPg/7/
[09:31:12] <tomasm-> can anyone tell me why event.keyCode = 0 with a keypress, while event.which and event.charCode are 49 (or whatever)?
[09:31:19] <tomasm-> why would keyCode be 0?
[09:31:49] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: Because $(this).unbind('click', creditButtonExpand) isn't unbinding all the listeners you attach with $('.credits-dropdown:not(.disabled):not(.active)').bind('click', creditButtonExpand);
[09:32:39] <t4nkd> Shit, okay, cool, thankyou
[09:32:54] <t4nkd> Appreciate your help, in a very serious way
[09:32:55] <Eviltwin> I'd try to avoid the unbinding/rebinding entirely
[09:33:13] <NoiseEee> tomasm-: use keydown instead of keypress
[09:33:20] <NoiseEee> tomasm-: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html
[09:33:24] <t4nkd> Is there a better approach I could find reference to perhaps?
[09:33:45] <t4nkd> I'm assuming it's clear enough what I'm trying to do...
[09:33:56] <NoiseEee> tomasm-: or fiddle?
[09:34:45] <aleray> hi, how can I filter input element that have a value attribute and that value is not an empty string
[09:34:47] <aleray> ?
[09:35:05] <vacho> how can I get net weeks date range (mon - sun) on any given day using jquery?
[09:35:51] <t4nkd> Well, changing the ButtonCollase bind to use (this).parent works out, but, I would love to learn the right pattern for building this kind of functionality, if anyone has any references/books/etc
[09:39:40] <tomasm-> ok I have a set of fields I mark 'required' (a class) and I disable the submit button until all of them have values.... but if I use keydown/keypress to initiate it immediately (so once a character is typed, the submit is enabled), calling $('form').find('.required[value=]') still shows the field, even though i just typed anything. I print j(this).val() in the keydown, but it seems to be one character behind. any ideas?
[09:39:44] <tomasm-> ie delayed
[09:39:46] <tomasm-> by one char
[09:39:48] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: http://jsfiddle.net/KVQ43/
[09:40:21] <tomasm-> probably because it's in the keydown, before the value gets put into the field....
[09:40:34] <EdwardIII> damn it's hot
[09:40:36] <tomasm-> (hm maybe keyup is what i need?)
[09:41:00] <tomasm-> EdwardIII, where at?
[09:42:02] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: Or maybe the slightly shorter (but less performant): http://jsfiddle.net/KVQ43/1/
[09:42:04] <t4nkd> Ahhh, if (some stuff) {return}
[09:42:16] <t4nkd> Seems like kind've the piece I didn't understand
[09:43:37] <geoff__> does anyone use jquery with RoR?
[09:43:41] <geoff__> how does the gem work?
[09:43:48] <geoff__> do I still have to include jQuery?
[09:46:20] <t4nkd> Eviltwin: Thanks for being really helpful, I appreciate your time

[09:57:30] <lionrouge> hi
[09:57:52] <lionrouge> i want to execute some php code inside my js script
[09:57:58] <lionrouge> is it possible?
[09:58:34] <cohitre> lionrouge: no
[09:58:54] <cohitre> unless you're asking the wrong question. what do you want to do?
[09:59:17] <lionrouge> so there is a php function to send mail
[09:59:47] <lionrouge> and i have a js code which shows a form and do all events on clicks etc.
[10:00:09] <lionrouge> need them to work together
[10:00:21] <cohitre> lionrouge: make the form work without js first and then use an ajax call to submit the form.
[10:00:56] <lionrouge> it's not a canonical html form
[10:01:03] <lionrouge> just some inputs
[10:02:15] <jedimind> ok ladies and gents, www.jqueryto.com is now official and ready for exposure
[10:02:52] <jeffsmykil> I found a bug jedimind
[10:03:00] <jeffsmykil> the page is all disjointed ;)
[10:03:21] <t4nkd> I like it, but my right-to-left scan pattern doesn't
[10:05:01] <cohitre> lionrouge: then make it a form and make it work by itself. else you won't be able to do what you want to do
[10:05:11] <lionrouge> i see
[10:05:13] <lionrouge> thanks
[10:09:39] <jeffsmykil> no one has any experience with kineticjs?

[10:27:01] <sunbeam> how to select the top LI of the sub li ?
[10:27:11] <sunbeam> the top LI it is in
[10:27:53] <rabbi1> li:first-child
[10:28:04] <rabbi1> sunbeam: ^
[10:28:23] <FrozenFire> Anyone know how best to load content dynamically into a JQuery Tools Overlay?
[10:28:31] <FrozenFire> I'm getting weird behaviours with the way I'm doign it.
[10:29:23] <sunbeam> rabbi1: no thats not what im looking for i think
[10:29:38] <sunbeam> rabbi1: i have a sub li, that has a class 'current_item'
[10:29:58] <sunbeam> if there is a sub li that has this class, i want the parent li (the top li) also to have this class
[10:31:07] <rabbi1> is there a way to check whether there is any content inside <span></span> tag or not ?
[10:32:41] <rabbi1> sunbeam: var topListItem = $(.current_item).length, if topListItem = 0 {}
[10:32:49] <FrozenFire> rabbi1, :empty selector?
[10:33:12] <rabbi1> FrozenFire: yeah, if empty ....
[10:33:23] <rabbi1> thank you, will have a look
[10:35:33] <rabbi1> Also, one of my project is in .net, anyway... I am trying to load all jquery methods from a file called loadjquery.js ... It's all perfect at initial load, if when a server request is made on submit of form, and then if server returns an error, my jquery is not loaded.... any way to sort this out ?
[10:37:20] <sunbeam> rabbi1: why would the top one have length = 0 ?
[10:37:30] <aitiba_> hi
[10:37:44] <aitiba_> someone that use jquery ui datepicker can help me please?
[10:38:03] <rabbi1> sunbeam: any time u get a length of any elements, it starts from zero, i am not a js expert, may be some one would ans it
[10:38:38] <sunbeam> hmm
[10:38:40] <sunbeam> ok lets see
[10:42:20] <GreekFreak> I have returned a json object in an ajax call, and when I do this    $('#summary h1').html(data["name"])    it populates with the correct string, but with quotes around it. How do I remove the quotes?

[10:45:54] <cohitre> GreekFreak: are you sure that your data doesn't have strings around it?
[10:46:06] <cohitre> GreekFreak: you could be serializing it twice.
[10:47:26] <sunbeam> how do i check whether after example.com/domain/xx <- here if there is something after / ?
[10:47:30] <sunbeam> with jquery

I have a <fieldset data-role="controlgroup"> that I'm putting a bunch of <inputs> into, but they aren't styled. I've tried everything I can think of to refresh, but no luck. Help? Thanks!
[10:52:27] <GreekFreak> cohitre, my json file has this { "name": "Test" }, but whe I remove them, it sends the json without the quotes, but then things like data["name"] or parsed.name don't display anything
[10:52:34] <hariom> I have trivial problem but hard to debug. Following code seems to work well in firebug console but not when put on the html page. Code is reachable by the document.ready() I have checked but event doesn't get popup. $('a.link_exclude').on('click', function(e) {console.log('clicked'); });
[10:52:58] <hariom> What could be the problem?
[10:53:36] <hariom> I have just downloaded and using jquery 1.7.2 as live() has got deprecated and on() is available to take its place
[10:53:55] <hariom> I check that jquery is loaded properly as I can see the version and also in firebug
[10:55:07] <bindi_> how can I get the value of this span when I know the div id? <div id="moo"><span id="foo">bar</span></div>
[10:57:25] <Cork> bindi_: the value of the span?
[10:57:29] <Cork> you mean its content?
[10:57:33] <bindi_> yes it's contents
[10:57:45] <Cork> $('#moo span').text()
[10:57:57] <josefig> I'm doing a simple .getJSON method and getting some html with it. Is it possible to get javascript too? in order to do a .html(response); ??
[10:58:26] <Cork> ?jquery.get @ josefig
[10:58:27] <bot-t> josefig, jQuery.get(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[10:58:58] <Cork> or $.post or $.ajax
[10:59:00] <josefig> dataType ?
[10:59:09] <Cork> its optional
[10:59:17] <evansiegel> Having a problem refreshing after adding content to a <fieldset> with jQueryMobile. Here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/Ymxrw/2/
[11:01:09] <josefig> Cork, http://pastebin.com/c6P4SvR0 but my question is that my output is like this: http://pastebin.com/CsHzAzh8 how can I do that?
[11:01:20] <bindi_> Cork: well I tried that.. it seems to work for the most part
[11:01:29] <josefig> I want to have my html response with javascript on it
[11:02:09] <bindi_> Cork: http://bindi.shroudbox.net/comments/ scroll down and you see it's broken for some reason :S
[11:04:31] <lionrouge> can jquery.post() get returned value?
[11:04:38] <lionrouge> from php function
[11:05:45] <bindi_> sure
[11:06:10] <bindi_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ see the second code example
[11:06:58] <Cork> lionrouge: no it can't get return values from php functions
[11:07:23] <Cork> but what you output on the page gets returned to the success callback
[11:08:11] <Cork> bindi_: you might be looking for .html() instead of .text()
[11:08:27] <bindi_> Cork: pretty sure that doesnt change the output
[11:08:27] <rabbi1> one of my project is in .net, anyway... I am trying to load all jquery methods from a file called loadjquery.js ... It's all perfect at initial load, if when a server request is made on submit of form, and then if server returns an error, my jquery is not loaded.... any way to sort this out ?
[11:08:32] <bindi_> Cork: did you scroll down? :D
[11:08:56] <Cork> bindi_: yes, but not sure what i'm looking for
[11:09:09] <FrozenFire> How can I determine why a link is being interfered with? I suspect that some over-general selector is adding a click handler with a preventDefault to certain links, but I cannot figure out where it is.
[11:10:16] <Cork> FrozenFire: firebug can break on script actions
[11:10:29] <Cork> that way you could find what function is called
[11:10:55] <Cork> but normally the simplest way is to just comment the handlers out to find them
[11:10:57] <bindi_> Cork: miceiken replied to user -> pekkahelloBINDItrollyeppersasdf1terveasdfasdasdasdterv
[11:11:06] <bindi_> Cork: tons of names and it keeps growing
[11:11:14] <FrozenFire> Cork, I haven't found any handlers which might be causing this
[11:12:01] <FrozenFire> Seems like all links in my overlay are broken
[11:12:07] <FrozenFire> They work if I right-click and open them
[11:12:11] <FrozenFire> But if I click them, they fail
[11:12:15] <FrozenFire> No errors
[11:12:17] <Cork> FrozenFire: then try the script activation breakpoint in firebug
[11:12:17] <FrozenFire> Just, nothing
[11:13:07] <Cork> bindi_: i'm not sure where this data comes from, so can't really tell what happens
[11:13:39] <FrozenFire> There's no way to inspect what event handlers exist on an element?
[11:14:18] <bindi_> Cork: is there anything I can do to help you understand? :p
[11:14:26] <Cork> josefig: document ready won't do anything when its loaded as a fragment
[11:14:50] <Cork> bindi_: well what is it your trying to do?
[11:14:52] <josefig> Cork, what should I use then?
[11:14:57] <someprimetime> how can I $('#blah').hover(function() { // save variable here}, function() { // pass it to here }); ?
[11:15:21] <bindi_> Cork: my php returns the comment ID, and if it is a reply, it returns the ID the comment is a reply to
[11:15:24] <Cork> josefig: just write the calls directly in the script tag
[11:15:30] <josefig> ok, thanks
[11:16:15] <josefig> Cork, didn't work, should I set something in the dialog ?
[11:16:16] <Cork> bindi_: so each reply comes as a separate ajax call?
[11:16:23] <bindi_> Cork: it comes as a bunch
[11:16:32] <Cork> josefig: could you build a working demo on jsfiddle?
[11:16:36] <bindi_> Cork: let me console.log the data retrieval thingy
[11:16:41] <someprimetime> nm i'll just use $(this)
[11:16:47] <josefig> hum, I guess so.
[11:16:55] <josefig> Let me eat something, brb
[11:16:57] <Cork> ?.data @ someprimetime
[11:16:58] <bindi_> Cork: check now :)
[11:16:58] <bot-t> someprimetime, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:17:27] <bindi_> Cork: I wanna show on each reply comment who the user replied to
[11:17:33] <bindi_> and it works, but then it doesn't. i don't get it
[11:18:21] <faryshta> Is there a way to know if an ajax is being redirected and where?
[11:19:14] <Cork> bindi_: you need to reduce the code so not the entire pages and php code needs to be dissected to understand what happens
[11:19:28] <bindi_> Cork: not sure how I'm going to do that :)
[11:19:29] <Cork> faryshta: only if the server tells you
[11:19:57] <Cork> bindi_: build a reduced demo where you remove as much of the dynamics as possible
[11:20:19] <rabbi1> Cork: u busy ?
[11:20:39] <Cork> bindi_:  1. you have quite likely that you will find the bug your self
[11:21:00] <Cork> and 2. its much easier to find the problem for someone else
[11:21:23] <Cork> rabbi1: looks like i always end up here as soon as i need to ask a question on irc :/
[11:21:59] <Cork> (trying to convert a dep package to a pkg.tar.gz)
[11:22:56] <rabbi1> Cork:  :) good luck then
[11:23:03] <Cork> thx :)
[11:23:18] <Cork> sitting and reading the dep spec right now :)
[11:26:17] <brennan_> Howdy all; I have a jqueryUI draggable inquiry.
[11:27:14] <tw2113> cool
[11:27:15] <brennan_> I'm looking to essentially disable the draggable mid-drag (without cancelling it), so that droppables will ignore it.
[11:27:18] <tw2113> ask your question
[11:27:45] <brennan_> Is there a sanctioned way to do that, other than do it manually?
[11:32:42] <brennan_> Adding { accept: 'not(".ignore")' } to every droppable is not ideal.
[11:34:28] <faryshta> Is there a way to know if an ajax is being redirected and where?
[11:38:30] <Lurzino> hello everyone!!!!!!!!!! :))))))))))
[11:43:58] <catcher> hello Lurzino
[11:45:01] <Lurzino> anyone knows if there is sort of a jquery plugin which would do something like at the top of this page www.ens.it about RSS slider?
[11:45:42] <alcuadrado> if I create an element with jquery, without attaching it to the dom, can I get is outerHTML?
[11:47:20] <alcuadrado> I can do it like: $elem[0].outerHTML
[11:47:26] <alcuadrado> but kind of sucks
[11:50:20] <trakinas> hello, all! can someone help understand why jScrollPane is not working on a specific part of my site? in the non live version it does work.
[11:50:30] <trakinas> Here: http://eneplus.com.br/2012/06/sobre-energia-solar/ and http://eneplus.com.br/noticias/
[11:50:49] <trakinas> test site on another server: http://eneplus.zzub.com.br/2012/06/a-rio20/
[11:56:38] <MysterOnyx> I made a right click menu for a set of objects. When I right click on one and click delete, how do I get the properties of the item I right clicked? I can do $(this) for the delete element, but how do I access the object's id?
[12:00:28] <Lurzino> no suggest about a jquery plugin name to slide RSS feeds ?
[12:00:50] <oneseventeen> I'm trying to interact with an element whose ID contains special characters... is this possible?
[12:01:44] <oneseventeen> $(' #subfolder-I%27m+Confused%3F').remove();
[12:01:49] <oneseventeen> (but without the space)
[12:02:04] <oneseventeen> $('#subfolder-I%27m+Confused%3F).remove();
[12:02:15] <oneseventeen> that doesn't work, but I was wondering what specifically causes it not to work...
[12:03:44] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you around?
[12:04:49] <someprimetime> he's probably @ jquerycon
[12:05:09] <bindi_> err Cork, I fixed it.. I tried the .html as you suggested.. and it works
[12:05:11] <Cork> oneseventeen: just write exactly what your putting into the id attribute, and it should work as long as those characters are valid for the id attribute
[12:05:18] <Cork> bindi_: :)
[12:05:19] <bindi_> I have no ide ahow this changes anything :p
[12:05:39] <Cork> bindi_: .text() will only handle test
[12:05:44] <jeffsmykil> someprimetime: alas you are probably correct
[12:05:55] <oneseventeen> Cork: that's what I'm not sure of... is what characters are valid for the id attribute.
[12:06:04] <Cork> html tags will be ignored when it outputs, or handled as text if you input it
[12:06:57] <oneseventeen> if I have an item with id='subfolder-I%27m+Confused%3F' and I have jquery echo out the ID of that object it will display '#subfolder-I%27m+Confused%3F' just fine.
[12:07:03] <jeffsmykil> are there any good canvas libraries that are compatible with excanvas?
[12:07:05] <oneseventeen> (but without the #)
[12:07:20] <bindi_> Cork: yes but .text returned hundreds of names for some reason
[12:07:22] <Cork> oneseventeen: "The id global attribute is now allowed to have any value, as long as it is unique, is not the empty string, and does not contain space characters. "
[12:07:33] <Cork> thats from the html5 spec
[12:08:09] <Cork> bindi_: both includes all the child elements in the element your copying
[12:08:19] <bindi_> Cork: but .html works fine t_t
[12:08:24] <Cork> bindi_: you might have something hidden there
[12:08:46] <oneseventeen> That's weird... any limitations in jquery perhaps?
[12:09:43] <oneseventeen> ooh, even easier, maybe I can just grab the parent object in the DOM and mess with that rather than dealing with the weird ID
[12:09:45] <Cork> well not jquery but sizzle might
[12:10:00] <Cork> ?g sizzle
[12:10:02] <bot-t> Cork, Sizzle JavaScript Selector Library - http://sizzlejs.com/
[12:10:37] <Cork> (jquery uses sizzle)
[12:10:44] <Woet> is there a reason the JQCON tickets are so expensive?
[12:11:20] <Cork> oneseventeen: sizzle might for example follow the html4 spec
[12:11:31] <Cork> oneseventeen: and its MUCH more restrictive
[12:12:34] <Cork> oneseventeen: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-name
[12:12:47] <Cork> "ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".")."
[12:13:37] <faryshta> Is there a way to know if an ajax is being redirected and where?
[12:13:38] <Cork> that said : and . is a BAD choice to have in your id's
[12:13:54] <NoiseEee> faryshta: watch the response etc in your console/firebug/etc
[12:13:55] <Cork> faryshta: i think i answered you before
[12:14:08] <asdf121> how can i do something like this? var cssSetting = $(something).css();  $(something).animate({ ... }).promise.done.... $(something).css = cssSetting;  Basically to reset the css properties on an element after i animate it
[12:14:30] <Cork> faryshta: script can't tell, the browser explicitly hides this
[12:14:48] <oneseventeen> hmmm, if I try to do something along the lines of this.parent().parent().remove() it still doesn't work... weird.
[12:14:49] <Cork> networks consoles can though
[12:15:11] <NoiseEee> oneseventeen: also it sounds like you're abusing your elementID to talk about other things that could be better placed in a "data-" attribute
[12:15:21] <asdf121> what's the best way to attempt to run two different animations in parallel ?
[12:15:38] <Cork> NoiseEee: i don't think he is
[12:15:38] <Koganei> asdf121: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/754607/can-jquery-get-all-css-styles-associated-with-an-element
[12:15:46] <oneseventeen> NoiseEee: every time I add a data- attribute some other obscure jquery code takes over and my .click() function is ignored altogether.
[12:15:49] <Cork> he's just left with the short end :)
[12:15:55] <faryshta> NoiseEee, I need to do it with javascript.
[12:16:00] <oneseventeen> Cork: I'm totally abusing the ID to store data :)
[12:16:07] <Cork> oneseventeen: ???
[12:16:10] <Cork> WHY???
[12:16:18] <Cork> theres no reason what so ever
[12:16:22] <NoiseEee> oneseventeen: thats really your code doing funny things / "taking over" but whatevs
[12:16:24] <NoiseEee> faryshta: sorry no can do
[12:16:48] <Cork> faryshta: i had to deal with this a few weeks ago
[12:17:20] <Cork> faryshta: the only solution (like i said before) is to have the server tell the script where it was redirected to
[12:17:23] <MysterOnyx> on page load, a function is called that turns a div into a UI accordion: $('#meals_list').accordion(); That works fine. However, when I alter the div and redisplay it during runtime and then call the function again, the div does not turn into an accordion again. Any idea why? The function has been tested and the code has no errors.
[12:17:33] <faryshta> Cork, what do you mean by that?
[12:17:46] <oneseventeen> NoiseEee: I'm working on tweaking someone else's code and it looks like they assumed nobody would ever add any interactive elements that weren't handled by their script,
[12:18:07] <Cork> faryshta: in my case i added an X-Target: url header to the xhr response
[12:18:18] <faryshta> Cork, the server throws a 302 status with a Location header.
[12:18:18] <oneseventeen> but there's so many moving parts it is hard for me to find where the selector is initially defined.
[12:18:23] <Cork> then the script could check that and find where its at
[12:18:33] <Cork> faryshta: 3xx never gets to scripts
[12:18:34] <[psy]> why are all the comments closed on api.jquery.org? like this page http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.globalEval/
[12:18:43] <Cork> the browser explicitly hides this
[12:18:44] <oneseventeen> (and this was all working super awesome until I allowed weird characters
[12:18:50] <[psy]> i wanted to reply to state that globaleval actually uses window.eval now
[12:19:11] <Cork> faryshta: its a security feature
[12:19:35] <faryshta> Cork, even with "head" instead of "get" ?
[12:20:15] <Cork> xmlHTTPRequest never returns 3xx statuses
[12:20:29] <Cork> it swallows it and does the redirect silently
[12:20:38] <faryshta> Cork, thanks. I will try to find other solutions then.
[12:21:24] <knapper_tech> i need to copy a dom element into a variable and do dom manipulation on the copy
[12:21:44] <Cork> ?.clone @ knapper_tech
[12:21:46] <bot-t> knapper_tech, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[12:21:57] <knapper_tech> cool
[12:22:32] <oneseventeen> if I try alert(this.closest('tr').id); I get redirected to a page with a json object...
[12:22:57] <Cork> uh... .id?
[12:22:57] <knapper_tech> Cork:   and to do dom manipulation in the context of the clone?
[12:23:03] <MysterOnyx> on page load, a function is called that turns a div into a UI accordion: $('#meals_list').accordion(); That works fine. However, when I alter the div and redisplay it during runtime and then call the function again, the div does not turn into an accordion again. Any idea why? The function has been tested and the code has no errors. Other $()'s in the function are running correctly, so it's only
[12:23:04] <MysterOnyx> $.accordion() that isn't updating correctly.
[12:23:15] <Cork> knapper_tech: just work on the variable
[12:23:32] <Cork> knapper_tech: ex. copy.find('span').remove()
[12:23:54] <faryshta>  Cork after the script is redirected. Can I get where it was redirected?
[12:24:08] <Cork> faryshta: if the server tells it, like i said
[12:24:19] <Cork> the server has to set a header with the url, else; no
[12:24:27] <Cork> (or in another way)
[12:24:40] <Zenmaker> Does anyone have a copy of the jQuery query object plugin?
[12:24:48] <Zenmaker> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/index.php?q=project/query-object
[12:24:52] <Zenmaker> Can't access this page
[12:24:56] <lionrouge> hi
[12:25:22] <lionrouge> i need to check data in input field
[12:25:40] <lionrouge> it should contain only characters from a fixed set
[12:25:51] <lionrouge> what is the best way to do it?
[12:26:03] <Zenmaker> regex
[12:26:16] <MysterOnyx> I fixed my problem. I had to first destroy the accordion like this: $('#meals_list').accordion('destroy').accordion();
[12:26:26] <stongo> I'm having some setTimeout issues, wondering if anyone could help. I'm looping through an array, and want to trigger a function in a setTimeout for every array item. The setTimeout is just firing the function without any delay
[12:26:38] <stongo> http://pastebin.com/L3WRjcYH
[12:27:13] <NoiseEee> stongo: setTimeout(function() { charCount(field,count); },4000);
[12:27:25] <NoiseEee> stongo: you're invoking it immediately
[12:27:41] <oneseventeen> just found that simply setting tmpID = this.closest('td').id; triggers a post script...
[12:27:52] <oneseventeen> (triggers a script that launches some ajax)
[12:27:53] <NoiseEee> also if 'field' is truly an array you should iterate via "for x=0; x<.arrayLenght"  and not for/in
[12:28:27] <stongo> NoiseEee: awesome, that worked!!!
[12:28:33] <stongo> NoiseEee++
[12:28:41] <Cork> stongo: also, you need to remember that timers are async
[12:28:52] <Cork> so all the timers will trigger at the same time
[12:29:07] <Cork> so you prob want to chain them instead
[12:29:16] <knapper_tech> need jquery mobile event that fires after page has been enhanced
[12:30:23] <stongo> Cork: in this case, it's okay if they fire simultaneously, but definitely good to know
[12:30:34] <stongo> timers are tricky
[12:31:04] <Cork> stongo: the reason is that the function where you call the loop will end before ANY timers are triggered
[12:31:16] <Cork> *call the timers in
[12:32:25] <stongo> Cork: ah yes, I see what you mean. I did a console.log of the parameters passed to charCount function, and they are the same!
[12:32:31] <Cork> so function() { /* code */ setTimeout(); /* code */ /* code */ /* code */ return; /* this is when the timer can first be triggered */ }
[12:33:25] <Cork> stongo: they will basically run like if they where one big setTimeout callback
[12:33:37] <oneseventeen> ok, so even if I loop through a list of elements and say this.remove(); it still doesn't remove.
[12:34:09] <Cork> oneseventeen: are you hitting the element your looking for?
[12:34:17] <Cork> $(selector).length > 0
[12:34:42] <oneseventeen> I can have it alert(this.id) and it displays the correct ID.
[12:35:08] <Cork> oneseventeen: but you should stop doing what your doing
[12:35:21] <Cork> id is one of the worst attributes you can abuse like this
[12:35:35] <tompaw> Guys, I'm probably missing something obvious here, but why doesn't this code: http://jsfiddle.net/bF4Az/ display an alert?
[12:35:43] <Cork> its quite special, and the browser will build a hash table for looking up based on these values
[12:35:45] <tompaw> The http query returns 200 OK.
[12:35:46] <oneseventeen> Cork agreed, I was being lazy.
[12:36:07] <tompaw> I wireshark'd it, and it does return a proper JSON.
[12:36:08] <oneseventeen> is there an easy way to create an array that I can manipulate and access throughout the life of the document?
[12:36:14] <Cork> so putting a lot of data in id will waist memory
[12:36:23] * oneseventeen is a javascript noob and is really just here to do back-end work
[12:36:33] <tompaw> Then I used firebug to debug it line by line, no errors.
[12:36:40] <Cork> oneseventeen: sure, just save it on the global scope
[12:36:41] <tompaw> Also, no errors in FF console.
[12:36:48] <Cork> oneseventeen: or attach it to the element
[12:36:49] <tompaw> It simply never ever calls the callback function. (http://jsfiddle.net/bF4Az/)
[12:37:42] <tompaw> Is there something "special" about google's http responses that jquery cannot handle?
[12:37:48] <tompaw> gzip maybe?
[12:38:05] <Cork> tomaw: gzip is handled by the browser not content
[12:38:44] <oneseventeen> Cork: how do I attach the data to the element?
[12:38:52] <stongo> tompaw: for some reason the success function isn't firing
[12:39:02] <tompaw> Cork: so I thought :(
[12:39:03] <Cork> tomaw: and that shouldn't be json, it should be jsonp
[12:39:12] <Cork> you can't load json cross domain
[12:39:16] <oneseventeen> (for some reason every time I add data-anything clicking the buttonfires off someone else's scripts)
[12:39:21] <tompaw> ah
[12:39:28] <Cork> oneseventeen: from javascript or from html tags?
[12:40:05] <tompaw> aaaah
[12:40:11] <Cork> actually you can't load anythin bug jsonp, javascript and images cross domain
[12:40:12] <tompaw> jsonp is probably the reason, thanks, will give it a try.
[12:40:27] <tompaw> so all I have to do is add callback=? to the URI, right?
[12:40:31] <Cork> (jsonp is basically javascript)
[12:40:35] <Lurzino> anyone could suggest a jquery plugin name to slide RSS feeds if exists , like at the top of this site www.ens.it?
[12:40:49] <Cork> tomaw: the server has to give a different response too
[12:42:12] <tompaw> "Google has disabled JSONP for V3 of the GeoCoding API being mentioned above"
[12:42:15] <tompaw> ???
[12:42:25] <Cork> so nogo
[12:42:34] <Cork> you need to proxy it over your domain
[12:42:55] <tompaw> jesus christ monkey balls!
[12:43:53] <tompaw> and at the same time google says: Note: the Geocoding API may only be used in conjunction with a Google map; geocoding results without displaying them on a map is prohibited.
[12:44:32] <Cork> tomaw: they have a library to do the lookup, use tht
[12:44:36] <Cork> *that
[12:44:52] <tomaw> Every time you do that my phone beeps :(
[12:45:04] <Cork> do what?
[12:45:06] <tompaw> Cork: I thought geocoding was the way... do you happen to know the name of that library?
[12:45:09] <tomaw> highlight me
[12:45:14] <tomaw> :P
[12:45:24] <Cork> tomaw: googles api js libs
[12:45:43] <Cork> you load the lib and get objects to handle mapps and geolocations and so on
[12:45:55] <raj> if I'm doing a $.post from a function (from an .on('click') handler), and want the callback to be a named function outside the original function, how can I refer back to the same element that triggered the original $.post in the callback?
[12:46:08] <oneseventeen> ok, got the array working... that was easy and I'm embarrased...
[12:46:22] <Cork> raj: check the context argument
[12:46:29] <Cork> ?.on @ raj
[12:46:31] <bot-t> raj, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:46:31] <oneseventeen> next question: how do I determine what the last key is in a javascript array?
[12:46:45] <oneseventeen> (so when I use jquery to create new rows with these auto-populated IDs)
[12:47:01] <Cork> oneseventeen: arr[arr.length-1]
[12:48:37] <oneseventeen> false alarm... for some reason it still isn't dropping the folders
[12:49:13] <game16> hi
[12:49:25] <game16> is there a way to set the innerHTML of svg elements in javascript?
[12:49:46] <oneseventeen> doh, just me being dumb with fadeOut
[12:50:02] <oneseventeen> if I give a callback function it fails, so I must be doing something wrong.
[12:50:12] <Cork> game16: its just dom so sure
[12:50:35] <Cork> game16: just select the element your after and do it normally
[12:50:55] <game16> Mmm i've been trying but it doesn't seem to work
[12:50:56] <tompaw> Cork: thanks, it's gonna be a long night for me.
[12:52:01] <raj> Cork, something like this http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/SjqYL/
[12:54:29] <Cork> raj: post doens't take a context so use $.ajax instead
[12:54:43] <raj> aah, ok, cool
[12:54:49] <raj> never used $.ajax before
[12:55:37] <Cork> i barely ever use anything else
[12:56:09] <Cork> the syntax is compact enough, and you never have to replace it cause the option you need is hidden :)
[12:59:03] <oneseventeen> Cork: thanks for the noob help, it is all flowing fine and better than ever.
[13:02:51] <deathboy> I'm having some issues trying to figure something out with jquery slideup and slidedown
[13:03:25] <deathboy> http://exactprecisions.com/WORK/golfsite/
[13:05:03] <Tyr0> is it possible for a function to wait until $.when().then() is called to return?
[13:10:06] <MysterOnyx> Tyr0 maybe I'm misunderstanding your question, but isn't that the point of $.when?
[13:10:17] <MysterOnyx> for a function to wait until something is done
[13:10:41] <Tyr0> that's what i thought
[13:11:05] <Tyr0> i think I'm not explaining myself well enough
[13:11:47] <Tyr0> if have "some_func = function() { $.when($.ajax(…)).then(return something));"
[13:12:01] <Tyr0> and calling some_func returns null
[13:12:42] <Tyr0> the function is skipping the $.when() and just returning, I'm assuming because of the ajax
[13:12:56] <Lurzino> tompaw concerning geocoding API shouldn't be better to have a server-side webservice like a php file that query Google to obtain geocoding? it's about due of quotas
[13:13:16] <MysterOnyx> Tyr0 I'm a newbie, but I doubt it's skipping the $.when
[13:13:42] <MysterOnyx> perhaps someone else can help
[13:13:49] <Tyr0> well the $.when still gets called
[13:14:06] <Tyr0> if i place a log in the then() it gets called fine…but *after* my function has already returned
[13:14:37] <Tyr0> i think my layout is not structured correctly…I'm used to c :p
[13:15:03] <NoiseEee> Tyr0: what are you trying to do?  run something when the xhr/ajax is complete?
[13:16:11] <Tyr0> i want to be able to do my_var = some_func(some_var)
[13:16:32] <NoiseEee> so, go for it?
[13:16:38] <Tyr0> and some_func to call $.ajax, and to return one of the request's vars
[13:17:12] <Tyr0> well if i try to return request.data, since the request takes time to build, it's delayed
[13:17:16] <NoiseEee> Tyr0: you'll need to break them up into different functions / use callbacks.  js is async.
[13:17:27] <Tyr0> and javascript has already set my_var to undefined
[13:17:27] <NoiseEee> Tyr0: first job: get the value from xhr.  next, run some_func()
[13:17:45] <MistuhKurtz> MOAR CALLBACKS
[13:17:46] <Tyr0> nested functions, i gotcha
[13:17:46] <MistuhKurtz> :D
[13:18:31] <Tyr0> me == js newbie
[13:29:40] <Kzim> hello i have a little problem: i have this "1234<span style="">56789</span>" and i want parse and replace 1234567 as a link and have this: "<a href="">1234<span style="">567</a>89</span>" is there any way to do that please ?
[13:37:14] <rabbi1> is this the proper way for creatng function and calling it ?
[13:37:16] <rabbi1> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1066700/
[13:37:44] <josefig> how can I get the response from $.ajax call to another function?
[13:41:09] <Cork> josefig: either send the jqxhr object ajax create to the other function
[13:41:22] <Cork> or let that other function send you a callback
[13:41:45] <Cork> josefig: you can't return the value from an ajax call
[13:44:08] <NoiseEee> josefig: var xhr = $.ajax(<stuff>).done(function(data) {anotherFunction(data); } );
[13:44:17] <NoiseEee> rabbi1: looks right
[13:44:38] <NoiseEee> rabbi1: not sure what "if ($('.error_message').html()) " is supposed to do though
[13:44:46] <josefig> Cork, I want to create an ajax call when an item is dropped in order to get some html to create a dialog with options, but I have 3 droppable lists and I wanted to create a function to place the call and return the value like options = placeAjaxCall(); but as is asynchronous hum,
[13:46:21] <Cork> josefig: yup, not doable
[13:46:36] <rabbi1> it will check for content between the start and end tag
[13:46:53] <josefig> Cork, so, I need to create inside the drop : function() of every droppable list the .ajax call right?
[13:47:43] <macmartine> Why do these return different values? (the second one is correct) https://gist.github.com/3020546
[13:47:43] <Cork> josefig: that or you could call the function your after from the success callback
[13:48:13] <rabbi1> NoiseEee: also, i want to style content with in the <em> tag which is assinged to varialble, like: var something = 'Something <em>Bold<em>';  Can i add styles to 'Bold' here?  and if so how, coz i am unable to get the result with just em { font-weight: bold; }
[13:48:31] <Cork> macmartine: .data looks at the dom attibute only if it doesn't have the value in its cache
[13:49:25] <NoiseEee> rabbi1: you can't add styles unless its in the DOM somehow
[13:49:27] <macmartine> Cork: ah, that kinda sucks
[13:49:58] <Cork> macmartine: not really, just never use the attr
[13:50:07] <rabbi1> NoiseEee: ok, thank you
[13:50:11] <NoiseEee> bah Cork
[13:50:24] <NoiseEee> you have to use the attr if you ever want the element by data- lookup
[13:50:25] <macmartine> Cork: Never use the attr? What do you mean?
[13:50:25] <systemfault> rabbi1: $(something).find('em').css('color', 'hotpink') ?
[13:50:46] <Cork> NoiseEee: not if the data- is set on it to begin with
[13:51:04] <Cork> NoiseEee: js can just use .data('something', value) if it wants to add it
[13:51:26] <macmartine> Cork: Can you clarify what you are suggesting? I am seting it with .data
[13:51:41] <rabbi1> systemfault: will that do ? 2 secs
[13:51:43] <NoiseEee> Cork: if you want to grab something from the DOM with data-customerCode='8', you must use the attr
[13:51:53] <Cork> NoiseEee: sure
[13:52:09] <Cork> NoiseEee: but thats normally a bad idea anyway
[13:52:10] <NoiseEee> Cork: so im just saying, don't "never use the attr" :)
[13:52:12] <systemfault> rabbi1: If you assign the return of that to a variable and later add it to the main DOM tree, sure
[13:52:18] <NoiseEee> Cork: why would that be bad?
[13:52:33] <Cork> NoiseEee: cause selecting on attributes is normally really slow
[13:52:34] <NoiseEee> "give me all elements that are for wheels"
[13:53:05] <Cork> macmartine: normally use data to access and save the data, not attr
[13:53:14] <macmartine> oh, i see… i was setting it explicitely at first
[13:53:29] <Cork> macmartine: .data does quite a bit of magic on the data so what it gives you isn't the same to begin with
[13:53:33] <systemfault> rabbi1: var something = "asdasdsa<em>adsda</em>sadsd";  var somethingFragment = $(something); somethingFragment.find('em').css('color', 'hotpink');
[13:55:17] <rabbi1> systemfault: fragment ?
[13:55:36] <systemfault> rabbi1: Name it the way you want :P But it's a DOM fragment
[13:55:43] <rabbi1> systemfault: sorry, for a sec thought that is a key word
[13:56:47] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah, it did the trick, i have just added a 'color','#FF0000' but now its also taking other styles mentioned in the css..... it's a normal behaviour ?
[13:56:55] <josefig> Cork, It fits better now, I create an outside function for drop that calls an ajax call that the success function is outside too =)
[13:59:51] <systemfault> rabbi1: Sure, depending where you append the node, some styling will be inherited
[14:00:03] <systemfault> rabbi1: That's how CSS works.
[14:01:22] <systemfault> rabbi1: Also.. a lot of elements have "default styling rules"… for example, <em> is italic
[14:02:02] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah, but i am not getting italic, even though i have not mentioned normal,
[14:02:39] <systemfault> rabbi1: Then you probably have some CSS rule overriding this somewhere..
[14:02:44] <rabbi1> systemfault: just color and font-size, and its taking both the styles just adding a single css property in the DOM...
[14:03:30] <systemfault> rabbi1: If you don't learn CSS… JS, even with jQuery is going to be hellish
[14:03:51] <rabbi1> systemfault: anyway, din't wanted to screw it up, added few more styles.... :)
[14:04:12] <systemfault> rabbi1: inline style have the highest CSS specificity so yeah.. it will work
[14:04:16] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: jQuery 1.x will provide ongoing support for IE 6-8, even after jQuery 2.0 (and subsequent versions) are released. http://t.co/Ppu98rvA ★ http://bit.ly/L8PSRA
[14:04:18] <systemfault> *styles
[14:04:43] <systemfault> Ahhh, good news from the bot.
[14:05:08] <systemfault> It would have been the death of jQuery if it gave up IE7 and IE8 support)
[14:05:49] <rabbi1> systemfault: specificity, i make sure that i read specificity once in a while, else i forget that part always
[14:07:17] <systemfault> rabbi1: It's <em><strong>very</strong></em> important
[14:07:44] <rabbi1> systemfault: and i have a problem with datepick inside the dialog form. the datepick displays the calendar on click only on the fresh load of the page, if there is any error after submission and when it is redirected due to error, then datepick doesn't work, most of the jquery stuff doesn't work, any clue ?
[14:08:26] <systemfault> rabbi1: What happens on submission? How do you submit (XHR? Normal?)
[14:09:59] <rabbi1> systemfault: have no idea, i am into front end, the project is on .net, they complain of it. can't check that now though :(
[14:10:24] <systemfault> Sucks :(
[14:10:34] <rabbi1> systemfault: it's actually a Search and Get back the result .... inside a ui dialog on condition of date ....
[14:11:27] <rabbi1> systemfault: those guys are fucking crazy, their <form> starts before all tag :) very much sucks
[14:12:26] <rabbi1> systemfault: actually submission retrieves the result, but searching for the second time will not load the datepick (may be jquery) i might be doing something wrong....
[14:12:34] <systemfault> rabbi1: You're the one who's writing the HTML I hope?
[14:12:49] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah, entire UI
[14:13:14] <systemfault> Then I don't understand that part.. systemfault: those guys are fucking crazy, their <form> starts before all tag  very much sucks
[14:14:27] <rabbi1> systemfault: <form><html><head></head><body></body></html></form> this is their structure :(
[14:14:50] <systemfault> rabbi1: It's invalid HTML.. tell then to take their heads out of their asses.
[14:15:21] <systemfault> For you to do your job properly, they need to be more cooperative.
[14:15:35] <systemfault> Does the document even have a doctype?
[14:15:42] <rabbi1> systemfault: they don' listen.....
[14:16:04] <systemfault> Fucking idiots.
[14:16:11] <systemfault> (Sorry for the language)
[14:16:40] <rabbi1> systemfault: no, that's not a problem.... that waste VS gives in proper structure when changed to HTML later on the browser
[14:16:46] <rabbi1> systemfault: that's not a problem at all
[14:17:43] <rabbi1> systemfault: that is changed to <html><head></head><body><form>All other entire content</form></body>
[14:18:13] <systemfault> And you have a doctype in the resulting HTML document?
[14:18:28] <systemfault> If not… you're going to have a lot of pain in quirksmode.
[14:18:45] <rabbi1> systemfault: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
[14:19:02] <systemfault> Oh good
[14:19:17] <rabbi1> systemfault: i infact, have kept my ie testing at the last stage, else i am fucked
[14:19:53] <systemfault> Then now, you need to understand what happens when you submit the form.. are you doing it with ajax? Are you redirected to another page?
[14:22:12] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah ajax, its a dialog box with search options, on date from, date to and a keyword. it results in set of matching values. once this values are displayed in the same dialog box (imp to note) below the input elements mentioned above .... then i don't get the same datepick drop down ....
[14:23:06] <systemfault> rabbi1: Do you use .load? Do you get back HTML from your ajax transaction?
[14:23:33] <rabbi1> and what do u think of coding this way <a id="something" onclick="searchall();" href="javascript:void(0);" >
[14:24:32] <systemfault> That would probably work even if using event delegation would be more appropriate, try it
[14:25:01] <rabbi1> yeah, i get html
[14:25:47] <Es0teric> has anyone here used the modal from bootstrap?
[14:26:45] <Zzaichik> Es0teric: What's your question about it
[14:27:08] <Es0teric> Zzaichik i am trying to put a callback in a bootstrap modal to load content from another page
[14:27:39] <rabbi1> systemfault: but is that making my jquery work only on load and not once any form is submitted and returned back from the server ?
[14:28:15] <Zzaichik> Es0teric: And it's not loading anything? Or are you getting an error or what's happening
[14:28:36] <systemfault> rabbi1: If you use replace the html of the form with something else… you killed all the bound handlers...
[14:29:07] <systemfault> rabbi1: You're not giving me enough information.. that makes it really hard to help you
[14:29:55] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah may be.... anyway it's 3 am in here, need some rest i guess :)
[14:30:02] <systemfault> Haha :P
[14:30:17] <Es0teric> Zzaichik its not loading anything... i have this -> $('#idtobeclicked').on('click', function() { $('#divid').on('shown', function() { $(this).load() //thats to load the stuff from the other page }); return false; });
[14:30:37] <Zzaichik> ahh
[14:31:03] <Zzaichik> Es0teric: the way bootstrap is setup really sucks, you'll have to attach that click event to document or 'body'.
[14:31:18] <Zzaichik> I mean, bootstrap is nice, but with event handling like that, I don't like it.
[14:31:20] <rabbi1> systemfault: event delegations will help me out, as of now ?
[14:31:42] <Es0teric> Zzaichik but why is that? i only want a div id to be clicked
[14:31:49] <Es0teric> then activate the modal
[14:31:53] <rabbi1> Es0teric: nice chain .....
[14:32:01] <rabbi1> systemfault: good day/night. take care
[14:32:11] <otherj> if i want to use .html in a ul, but want to leave the first li in there because it's a title (bootstrap nav), how do i do that?
[14:32:16] <Es0teric> rabbi1 uh.. thanks lol
[14:32:34] <zamn> hey how can i scroll down the page to a select div and click on a couple of links with jquery?
[14:32:37] <Zzaichik> Es0teric:  Well, the way that .on('click', …) works. Whatever your binding to needs to exist on DOM Ready.
[14:32:37] <zamn> is that possible?
[14:32:48] <Zzaichik> ?.on @Es0teric
[14:32:49] <bot-t> Es0teric, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:33:01] <rabbi1> Es0teric: solution for u r problem seems very easy, you are making it very complicated....
[14:33:15] <rabbi1> anyway, too late got to go.....
[14:33:17] <Es0teric> Zzaichik so would it be easier if i just do... .click() ? because .click() references .on() in jquery
[14:33:21] <Es0teric> source
[14:33:21] <rabbi1> good luck
[14:33:25] <Es0teric> and rabbi1 what do you mean?
[14:34:02] <Zzaichik> Es0teric: To make the code you posted work, change it to $('body').on('click', ...
[14:34:14] <Zzaichik> that "should" work with bootstrap
[14:34:32] <Es0teric> Zzaichik but i want it to load when a list item is clicked... not anywhere on the body
[14:34:33] <Es0teric> :|
[14:34:35] <knapper_tech> back button transitions in jquery mobile not generating beforepageshow events :-(
[14:34:45] <knapper_tech> any advices?
[14:35:09] <Zzaichik> Es0teric: go to jQuery's website and check out how .on() works man.
[14:35:27] <Es0teric> Zzaichik so would .click() be better?
[14:36:15] <Zzaichik> Es0teric:  $('body').on('click', '#element-that-is-clicked', function() {…}); If it works with .click() than of course use that.
[14:36:25] <Es0teric> OHH right ok ok
[14:37:36] <Zzaichik> I hate attaching stuff like that to 'body' but bootstrap doesn't leave you with much of a choice.
[14:38:49] <Es0teric> yeah, Zzaichik  but its still not loading
[14:38:49] <Es0teric> -_-
[14:38:55] <MysterOnyx> Let's say I have object x={}. I then make a few nested objects like x.ok = {} and x.no = {}. Is there a way for me to empty out all nested objects of an object? So I want x.ok and x.no to empty, but I don't want to empty the entire x object to do it
[14:43:56] <knapper_tech> is there a jqmobile irc?
[14:57:04] <`teh1> under what circumstances might .slider() generate "Cannot call method addClass of undefined" when one clicks it to drag the slider?
[14:57:38] <ajpiano> when you're calling "addClass" on something that isn't a jQuery object
[14:57:57] <`teh1> it's generated by the slider jQuery UI script
[14:58:09] <`teh1> internal
[14:58:34] <`teh1> all im doing is calling .slider() on an element. the element is turned into a slider, but clicking it generates that error
[15:05:36] <bakers> What's the "best" way to check if a checkbox is checked
[15:05:49] <tw2113> ?checked
[15:05:51] <bot-t> :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[15:05:55] <bakers> I'm doing $("box").is(":checked")
[15:06:16] <systemfault> bakers: $("box").prop("checked") should also work
[15:06:34] <systemfault> But any way is good imho
[15:06:44] <zamn> hey how would i be able to get my div class "artist" with the text "derp" as a jquery object?
[15:06:58] <zamn> $(".artist").text('derp').dostuff(); isnt working :p
[15:08:33] <bakers> zamn: look at contains
[15:09:36] <granden> If I only got one form on my page this would work for me $('input[name=name').val() but If I have multiple forms all with name=name
[15:09:39] <granden> fields.
[15:09:56] <granden> How could I specify to have the input field for the form with the id, loginForm
[15:10:17] <bakers> $(".artist:contains('derp')");
[15:10:41] <systemfault> lawlz
[15:11:22] <systemfault> When your JS starts depending on the text content of your website… You know you're doing something stupid.
[15:11:53] <granden> Anyone?
[15:12:17] <systemfault> granden: That's basic CSS>.
[15:12:22] <bakers> granden: I don't think having duplicate names is valid?
[15:12:36] <ravenzz> it is valid
[15:12:36] <granden> bakers: But it is in different forms.
[15:12:41] <systemfault> granden: $('#loginForm input[name="name"]')
[15:12:44] <ravenzz> but you can select that by id
[15:12:46] <ravenzz> :|
[15:13:03] <granden> yeah, but that would simplyfy it a bit.
[15:15:38] <granden> systemfault: the #loginForm is not the id of my input field rather my <form> but maybe you understood that?
[15:16:30] <systemfault> granden: Yes… that's basic CSS
[15:16:53] <granden> systemfault: Yeah, but never been any good at different selectors / what its called in css.
[15:17:03] <systemfault> $('#loginForm input[name="name"]') would get an input with name equal to "name" in the form with an id of #loginForm
[15:17:04] <granden> Always have used different ids instead.
[15:17:18] <granden> Thanks a lot though.
[15:24:39] <ravenzz> granden http://jsfiddle.net/vxBxP/
[15:25:04] <ravenzz> but it is kind of unsafe
[15:43:36] <granden> when making an ajax call, I would like to return a success/unsuccessfull value like 1 or 0
[15:43:50] <granden> should I echo it back or should I in my php file make a return 1 / 0?
[15:44:04] <Patrik2> Hello, I need help selecting  with adding a class. This is my code at the moment:  $(".block-menu-blogg-menu .menu li ul").addClass("subnav");     .  Is this incorrect?
[15:44:49] <rakm> extremely newbish question. I have jquery loaded already. Do I need to do anything special to use a jquery function on an object? The function I want to use (map) conflicts with a function with the same name in another library (ember)
[15:45:10] <venus_> hello, can anyone tell me what this page has used to move the header down to the bottom of the screen http://themes.goodlayers.com/365life/
[15:53:30] <tw2113> venus_ javascript
[15:53:35] <tw2113> just like we told you in #wordpress
[15:57:36] <boltR> is there a way to execute javascript that's been loaded using pjax()?
[15:58:54] <venus_> tw: but i cant find the javascript part there lol
[16:04:54] <tw2113> i see a LOT of javascript on that page venus_
[16:09:12] <tw2113> jQuery('#arrow-top').click( function(){ jQuery('html, body').animate({scrollTop: jQuery(window).height()-jQuery('#header').height() },{ duration: 'slow', easing: 'expoEaseInOut' }); });
[16:30:03] <oojacoboo> does anyone here every post to the same url multiple times, where the controller might run verification checks and return back error statuses or requests for more information, rather than trying to rely on js and a json dataset for checks?
[16:30:11] <oojacoboo> s/every/ever
[16:30:53] <vespakoen> hey guys, i'm looking for a very simple "horizontal style, sub navigation menu that is aware of the window size"
[16:30:57] <vespakoen> any suggestions?
[16:30:57] <oojacoboo> of course the save would do the checks before writing to the db or anything, but I'm purely talking about for UX and possibly some additional user imput
[16:31:16] <oojacoboo> vespakoen, yea, build your own
[16:31:31] <vespakoen> I don't want to reinvent the wheel =P
[16:31:44] <oojacoboo> yea ok...
[16:45:54] <cambazz> hello, i need to do a simple bargraph, from data, rendered in js
[16:46:22] <cambazz> any ideas? I used d3 visualization lib before, and i need something more lightweight i guess
[16:49:04] <vespakoen> raphael
[16:49:07] <vespakoen> does that kind of stuff
[16:49:12] <vespakoen> probably a lot of libs for it
[16:49:29] <cambazz> well to show number of logged in users. just a bargraph.
[16:49:36] <cambazz> d3 is heavy
[16:49:39] <cambazz> and slow
[16:49:52] <vespakoen> css
[16:50:05] <cambazz> yes, i was about to do that
[16:50:23] <vespakoen> sounds like a good plan to me
[16:50:52] <cambazz> well i was wondering if there is a way with twitter bootstap
[16:51:50] <vespakoen> nopd
[16:51:52] <vespakoen> nope
[16:54:47] <vespakoen> http://wijmo.com/demo/explore/#barchart|overview
[16:57:53] <cambazz> vespakoen: thank you
[17:22:55] <oojacoboo> $("element").on("DOMNodeInserted", function() {});  ?
[17:42:10] <aaairc> is there a jquery plugin/function that could accomplish the popup hovers that you see on hulu.com when you hover over the video clips? you will notice if the clip is too far to the right, the popup will instead appear to the left.
[18:20:44] <blindMoe> I am having an issue where $('el').is(':visible') is returning true even when the element is not visible.. can anyone give any pointers as to why this may be happening?
[18:21:21] <FesterCluck> Typically this trouble here is that display:none is not the same as visibility:hidden
[18:21:21] <blindMoe> arg nm.. I was using :visible wrong.. I thought it meant visible in viewport.. not just in the DOM
[18:21:53] <FesterCluck> Ah, you're looking for some sort of clipping method?
[18:22:55] <k1ng_> any idea how do i generate a json (on remote server) for cossdomain ajax?
[18:23:12] <k1ng_> i am talking about the json file btw
[18:23:18] <FesterCluck> k1ng_: THere are a lot of ways
[18:23:22] <FesterCluck> type it yourself
[18:23:33] <k1ng_> thats all?
[18:23:35] <FesterCluck> Use PHP and have it change the content-type
[18:23:43] <k1ng_> to json?
[18:23:43] <blindMoe> FesterCluck: just want to know if it is visible in the viewport? I want a function to start once a user scrolls to a position where the element can be seen in the browser
[18:23:58] <k1ng_> and $.GET can get the json file?
[18:24:06] <FesterCluck> a JSON file is nothing more than a text file with object notation. How you generate it is up to you
[18:24:12] <FesterCluck> k1ng_: yes
[18:24:17] <k1ng_> thanks
[18:24:38] <FesterCluck> blindMoe: Ah, you want to know if the element is scrolled out of view
[18:24:50] <blindMoe> yeap
[18:25:04] <FesterCluck> Ok, so here's the best way:
[18:25:13] <FesterCluck> There's no method just to do this
[18:25:35] <blindMoe> I know I could write a function to set if getBoundingClientRect() of the element and compare it to the window height and width but was wondering if there was a jquery method for this
[18:25:41] <FesterCluck> Is this element inside of another scrollable div, or are we scrolling the window?
[18:25:46] <blindMoe> FesterCluck: ahh ok.. I will use a custom function then
[18:25:51] <blindMoe> scrolling the window
[18:27:30] <FesterCluck> hmm, timers suck for this sort of thing, so you're gonna have to hook the onscroll event
[18:27:37] <FesterCluck> then just check dimensions
[18:27:39] <blindMoe> yeah that is what I am doing
[18:27:47] <FesterCluck> I know that SVG has a quick way of doing this
[18:28:00] <FesterCluck> Are you doing something artsy?
[18:28:09] <blindMoe> I have actually read that using a timer can help save some cpu cycles instead of having the function run on every scroll pos
[18:28:44] <FesterCluck> ... I can see that argument.
[18:29:44] <FesterCluck> If the element doesn't move, just write a closure that grabs all the necessary numbers, and throw it in a timer... Yeah, I can see that
[18:30:05] <blindMoe> yeah it sits in the same spot
[18:36:15] <blindMoe> FesterCluck: looks like someone already wrote a function to do it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123999/how-to-tell-if-a-dom-element-is-visible-in-the-current-viewport
[19:20:57] <bencahill> Hey guys, would it be possible to have a Selectable and be able to hide and unhide elements without messing up the selecting? (esp. click, shift+click selecting)
[21:07:04] <ecksit> I cannot seem to find why my jquery datepicker isn't working on my local machine. http://jsfiddle.net/RhdXx/
[21:07:46] <ecksit> Works on jsfiddle, but not locally. I have tested that they loaded correctly, however I am still stuck.
[21:08:01] <macmartine> ecksit: you have jquery in the right place?
[21:08:05] <ecksit> yep
[21:09:25] <ecksit> http://share.jacobbednarz.com/Developer_Tools_-_file__localhost_Users_jacob_Desktop_Solutions_2_index.html-20120630-140905.png
[21:09:49] <macmartine> coffeescript?
[21:10:08] <ecksit> nope, minified js
[21:11:00] <macmartine> are you sure you included the datepicker with your downlaod?
[21:12:35] <mogaal> hi, I have simple question: I save in var a table except first row -> var rows = $("#tabla_odis tr:gt(0)");. But also I want exclude the LAST row. How I do it?
[21:12:55] <macmartine> ecksit: It must be something about your local copy of js. Here's the simplest version working http://jsfiddle.net/RhdXx/2/
[21:13:02] <macmartine> er, of jquery
[21:13:10] <ecksit> cheers, will have a review
[21:13:29] <macmartine> ecksit: just open the jquery file and do a find for datepicker
[21:17:04] <UnixDev> i need to change the value of a select (combo) but i don't know the actual option='value', i only know the name or display name of that option.. is that possible and if so, how?
[21:20:04] <shoky> UnixDev: you can .prop('selected',true) on the <option>
[21:20:32] <UnixDev> shoky: but i have to iterate through the options… there is no way to find the option with a selector?
[21:20:38] <shoky> which option?
[21:20:50] <UnixDev> <option value='1'>Name</option>
[21:20:57] <shoky> so you do know the value?
[21:20:59] <UnixDev> i only have Name, but need to select it
[21:21:02] <UnixDev> i don't know the value
[21:21:04] <shoky> ok
[21:21:20] <shoky> $('option:contains(Name)') is one way,
[21:21:33] <UnixDev> ahh, genius! let me try
[21:22:14] <shoky> $('option').filter(function() { return $(this).text() == 'Name' }) is another, maybe better way

[21:25:41] <marandi> hi guys , i use tab in my submit form , so my form validate engine just check form from active tab and the other diactive tab wouldnt check by it , what should i do about it ?
[21:26:23] <gp5st> are there any plugins that allow a text field to be used like gmail's to box? where it'll autocomplete multiple elements. it doesn't have to be exactly like it. i'm just not sure what UI would be good for that autocomplete + allow new entries for a series of predefined values for the autocomplete
[21:26:40] <gp5st> i'm not even sure what i'm looking for is called:-\
[21:27:22] <gp5st> http://aehlke.github.com/tag-it/
[21:27:32] <gp5st> if anyone cared, that's exactly what i was looking for
[21:27:33] <gp5st> :)
[21:28:39] <ecksit> macmartine: Have you ever seen anything like this before? ui-widget-content
[21:28:46] <ecksit> Sorry, http://share.jacobbednarz.com/ui-error-20120630-142815.png
[21:29:10] <macmartine> ecksit: you don't have all the css
[21:29:20] <ecksit> ta
[21:34:20] <macmartine> ecksit: get it?
[21:34:42] <ecksit> yeah mate. seems some tosser hacked and chopped these fiels.
[21:34:44] <ecksit> files*
[21:36:00] <macmartine> cool
[21:36:26] <macmartine> i mean, not cool, but cool
[21:37:59] <ecksit> yeah, tossers
[21:47:48] <jim_m> hi
[21:48:40] <jim_m> how do I get the content from a specific node with div class='ad'
[21:49:04] <atno> $('.ad').innerHTML(0;
[21:49:08] <atno> $('.ad').innerHTML();
[21:49:31] <jim_m> thanks
[21:49:55] <jim_m> what if I want to delete that node and recreate it?
[21:50:04] <jim_m> this is to simulate a refresh
[21:50:18] <jim_m> I make a copy of the content and delete the node?
[21:59:34] <lordmortis> jim_m: you could do that, but why wouldn't you just change it's content?
[22:25:07] <jim_m> lordmortis, it's for an ad refresh
[22:25:27] <lordmortis> okay, so you want to load a new add with JQuery/Ajax ?
[22:25:56] <jim_m> I was hoping not to use ajax?
[22:42:50] <zamn> hey how would i go about getting a selected elements name
[22:57:11] <venus_> hello, can anyone tell me how is the content shifting down here http://themes.goodlayers.com/365life/
[23:01:32] <tw2113> jQuery('#arrow-top').click( function(){ jQuery('html, body').animate({scrollTop: jQuery(window).height()-jQuery('#header').height() },{ duration: 'slow', easing: 'expoEaseInOut' }); });

[23:13:51] <zamn> hey
[23:14:21] <zamn> for some reason: $("#" + $(this).text()); won't work
[23:14:23] <zamn> any clue why?
[23:15:16] <systemfault> zamn: Looks syntaxically correct.
[23:15:21] <zamn> x|
[23:15:29] <systemfault> Now.. give us a context.
[23:15:32] <zamn> lol
[23:15:34] <zamn> ill give you my actual code
[23:15:40] <zamn> var video = $(this).parent().children("#" + $(this).text());
[23:16:00] <oojacoboo> ?
[23:16:06] <oojacoboo> what does that have to do with anything
[23:16:18] <zamn> nothing
[23:16:25] <oojacoboo> umm ok?
[23:16:45] <oojacoboo> what is $(this) and text()
[23:16:57] <systemfault> zamn: perhaps you want .siblings() instead?
[23:16:59] <zamn> https://gist.github.com/3022617
[23:17:07] <zamn> line 13
[23:17:09] <zamn> is where it starts
[23:17:25] <systemfault> Oh my… le hack
[23:17:28] <oojacoboo> aaa here is the DOM?
[23:17:37] <zamn> im making the example now
[23:17:58] <oojacoboo> jsfiddle.net
[23:21:31] <zamn> http://jsfiddle.net/fbnsB/
[23:21:58] <zamn> there is your context
[23:22:20] <oojacoboo> zamn, there isn't a children().children("a")
[23:22:23] <zamn> oh wait
[23:22:24] <zamn> yea
[23:22:25] <zamn> lol.
[23:22:29] <oojacoboo> wo how is that click event suppose to fire?
[23:22:32] <oojacoboo> so*
[23:22:34] <zamn> no
[23:22:36] <zamn> i fucked up my dom
[23:22:37] <zamn> let me fix this
[23:22:42] <oojacoboo> yea ok...
[23:23:22] <systemfault> DOMinate the DOM!
[23:23:24] <oojacoboo> I'm 10 drinks man, what's going on here
[23:23:34] <oojacoboo> drinks in*
[23:24:54] <zamn> http://jsfiddle.net/fbnsB/1/
[23:24:55] <zamn> okay
[23:24:58] <zamn> that should be right
[23:24:59] <oojacoboo> how can I check to see if an event has fired, I'm doing a DOMNodeInstered event and need to disable the binded event after there has been a match
[23:25:51] <oojacoboo> zamn, sibling .videorul for one
[23:26:32] <oojacoboo> what's the problem?
[23:26:39] <zamn> video
[23:26:45] <oojacoboo> ummmmmmm ok?:?
[23:26:47] <zamn> isnt selecting the right thing
[23:26:52] <oojacoboo> yea ok
[23:26:57] <oojacoboo> cool story bro
[23:26:59] <zamn> lol
[23:27:38] <oojacoboo>  systemfault any thoughts on my question?
[23:27:53] <oojacoboo> 		$("div#unit-results").on("DOMNodeInserted", function(event) {
[23:27:58] <systemfault> oojacoboo: I never used that event..
[23:28:01] <oojacoboo> any idea how to cancel that event after a match
[23:28:12] <oojacoboo> shoudl be the same for all events
[23:28:14] <zamn> systemfault: have you taken a look at my fiddle?
[23:28:22] <oojacoboo> zamn, it sucks
[23:28:24] <zamn> (if you dare)
[23:28:25] <zamn> lol
[23:28:27] <systemfault> oojacoboo: event.preventDefault()
[23:28:27] <zamn> well
[23:28:29] <zamn> im new to jquery
[23:28:32] <oojacoboo> systemfault, mmm
[23:28:37] <zamn> what should i replace that with
[23:28:51] <zamn> ive been told javascript:void(0) blows balls
[23:28:55] <oojacoboo> systemfault, worth a shot I guess :/
[23:29:16] <systemfault> oojacoboo: Perhaps you also need to stop the bubbling, if so: event.stopPropagation()
[23:29:30] <systemfault> zamn: It's true..
[23:29:35] <oojacoboo> systemfault, yea, possibly
[23:29:37] <zamn> so what do i do
[23:29:43] <oojacoboo> and stopImmediatePropagation()
[23:29:47] <systemfault> zamn: But your code is very bad, man :'(
[23:29:50] <zamn> lol
[23:29:53] <zamn> which part
[23:30:00] <systemfault> zamn: All of it..
[23:30:02] <zamn> and what are you judging off of
[23:30:05] <zamn> the fiddle
[23:30:06] <zamn> or the gist
[23:30:10] <systemfault> zamn: the fiddle
[23:30:18] <zamn> are you talking about my js
[23:30:18] <zamn> or dom
[23:30:20] <zamn> lol
[23:30:26] <systemfault> zamn: Both.
[23:30:37] <zamn> well im a beginner
[23:30:40] <zamn> what can i say
[23:30:49] <zamn> this is my first time dabbling with jqueer
[23:30:53] <systemfault> Ahhh
[23:30:57] <systemfault> I get it now
[23:31:15] <zamn> ?
[23:32:00] <systemfault> zamn: You could start by cleaning up the markup :/
[23:32:20] <zamn> well thats how it is set up
[23:32:25] <zamn> results is where i display the search results
[23:32:32] <zamn> i seperate each song entity with a div
[23:32:53] <systemfault> zamn: What is titles…?
[23:32:54] <zamn> link to that songs artist which then reveals the song titles the artist has
[23:32:54] <venus_> tw2113: i know that part
[23:33:20] <oojacoboo> systemfault, yea, not having much luck with preventDefault() :/
[23:33:25] <systemfault> zamn: I'll give you a hint… it's a LIST of songs
[23:33:31] <systemfault> Anyway...
[23:33:34] <zamn> yes
[23:33:35] <tw2113> so you have your answer
[23:33:42] <zamn> and each song has its own video url and video embed
[23:33:43] <systemfault> zamn: For the js, you need to use event delegation.
[23:33:52] <zamn> which is why its in its own div
[23:34:06] <systemfault> zamn: In HTML, how do you represent a LIST
[23:34:13] <zamn> <ul> or <ol>
[23:34:15] <venus_> tw: when the page loads, you will see that the content is on top, it then slides down
[23:34:16] <systemfault> Wonderful.
[23:34:22] <venus_> i am not asking about the arrows, i know that part
[23:34:35] <zamn> is that div really a big deal
[23:34:42] <zamn> besides bothering you
[23:34:44] <systemfault> zamn: Not really.
[23:34:59] <zamn> that doesnt really help me with the original problem though
[23:35:09] <systemfault> zamn: The main problem is your awful selectors.
[23:35:10] <zamn> var video isnt being set correctly
[23:35:23] <zamn> systemfault: how can i fix that
[23:35:31] <Stephen> Screw that, <DL>
[23:35:39] <tw2113> venus_ once it loads, i see 2 people in car
[23:36:28] <zamn> dl is retarded
[23:36:36] <venus_> yes tw, but if you notice the content is first, then the slideshow loads, which pushes the content down
[23:36:48] <venus_> do a hard refresh you will notice
[23:36:50] <tw2113> i think that's called loading time
[23:36:57] <systemfault> zamn: You start by using event delegation like that: http://jsfiddle.net/fbnsB/2/
[23:36:58] <zamn> llol
[23:37:24] <zamn> lol
[23:37:28] <zamn> wow i just lol'd twice
[23:37:29] <zamn> must be funny
[23:38:42] <systemfault> zamn: I don't think an id can have a space in it..
[23:38:50] <zamn> its double quoted though
[23:38:52] <Stephen> oojacoboo: Remember, preventDefault() and return false;
[23:38:56] <systemfault> Doesn't matter.
[23:38:59] <zamn> ~_~
[23:39:18] <Stephen> no spaces in id's
[23:39:22] <Stephen> underscores are ok
[23:39:26] <oojacoboo> Stephen, does DOMNodeInsterted provide a loop?
[23:39:34] <oojacoboo> or am I misreading this forum thread?
[23:39:45] <Stephen> link me
[23:39:57] <oojacoboo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10674079/domnodeinserted-event-loop
[23:40:02] <Stephen> DOMNodeInserted, the mutexevent?
[23:40:12] <oojacoboo> is there more than one?
[23:40:26] <zamn> lawl so i have to replace spaces with underscores
[23:40:33] <oojacoboo> I basically need an event for one a DOM object is added
[23:40:55] <oojacoboo> s/one/when (damn you bourbon)
[23:40:55] <Stephen> oojacoboo: If you insert a node inside the handler for DOMNodeInserted, yes, it will loop
[23:41:08] <oojacoboo> a node?
[23:41:19] <oojacoboo> Stephen, 		$("div#unit-results").on("DOMNodeInserted", function(event) {
[23:41:49] <systemfault> zamn: That won't fix the shit code you written...
[23:42:04] <oojacoboo> Stephen, the issue is that it seems it fires for ALL elements added within that, even children of children, etc
[23:42:15] <oojacoboo> aka, maybe 20x
[23:42:21] <Stephen> Yup, for every node
[23:42:31] <oojacoboo> Stephen, any way around this?
[23:42:41] <zamn> systemfault: im rewriting it using your code
[23:42:50] <oojacoboo> would I just use the selector for the node it's inserting instead?
[23:42:59] <systemfault> zamn: var videoUrl = $(this).siblings('.videourl').text();
[23:43:05] <zamn> i did
[23:43:11] <systemfault> Ahh ok :)
[23:43:15] <zamn> ;)
[23:43:34] <Stephen> oojacoboo: Yes. unbind the event, insert the nodes, then re-bind it if you need
[23:43:46] <Stephen> jquery provides a function called .once() which will do it for you.
[23:43:59] <oojacoboo> mmm, I'll check it out, thanks
[23:44:44] <systemfault> zamn: Why is videourl a div instead of a link?
[23:45:42] <oojacoboo> Stephen, is that a bound event?
[23:45:51] <oojacoboo> bound handler*
[23:46:04] <zamn> systemfault: because im using it as reference
[23:46:09] <Stephen> oojacoboo: Note, you're using a Deprecated event. HTML5 is replacing DOMMutation Events
[23:46:27] <zamn> systemfault: basically that div stores the url to the youtube video
[23:46:37] <oojacoboo> Stephen, any recommendations on how to check for a parent event being added to the DOM?
[23:46:49] <oojacoboo> then to fire a function on that event
[23:46:57] <zamn> systemfault: and then video displays the youtube embed when its parent link is clicked on
[23:48:13] <systemfault> zamn: Why don't you store the url inside the <a>'s href then?
[23:48:27] <Stephen> oojacoboo: You want to fire an event when an /event/, or an /element/ is added?
[23:48:39] <oojacoboo> element
[23:48:56] <systemfault> zamn: If you click on it, the preventDefault will prevent the link to be followed but you can still access the url with $(this).attr('href')

[23:49:02] <Stephen> There's the warning
[23:49:13] <Stephen> But, yes, I have an answer for you
[23:49:16] <oojacoboo> what's the replacement?
[23:49:22] <oojacoboo> :)
[23:49:26] <zamn> systemfault: but then the url still displays
[23:49:29] <Stephen> Is the element getting inserted above the body?
[23:49:34] <zamn> oh wait no it doesnt
[23:49:41] <oojacoboo> Stephen, no, within the body
[23:50:22] <Stephen> So, here's the usage:
[23:50:23] <Stephen> element.addEventListener("DOMNodeInserted", function (ev) {   // ... }, false);
[23:51:00] <oojacoboo> Stephen, I thought you said that event was deprecated?
[23:51:34] <Stephen> or, with jQuery.one("DOMNodeInserted
[23:51:37] <Stephen> Well, here
[23:51:38] <Stephen> http://api.jquery.com/one/
[23:52:08] <oojacoboo> Stephen, still though, if that event is deprecated, what's the replacement :)
[23:52:33] <oojacoboo> also, is .one() a bound handler?
[23:52:39] <Stephen> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DOM_Mutation_Observers
[23:52:43] <oojacoboo> I'm assuming so
[23:53:08] <Stephen> oojacoboo: .one() is just like bind(), but removes the listener after one use
[23:53:16] <oojacoboo> gotcha
[23:55:00] <oojacoboo> Stephen, that spec doesn't say anything about the deprecation of DOMNodeInsterted :/

[23:55:27] <Stephen> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Mutation_events
[23:55:29] <Stephen> That does
[23:55:37] <Stephen> er
[23:55:38] <Stephen> wait
[23:55:57] <oojacoboo> yea, but the link I sent was part of the other one
[23:56:07] <Stephen> Here
[23:56:07] <Stephen> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM_Events
[23:58:25] <oojacoboo> Stephen, excuse my ignorance here, but the MutationObserver object has an event?
