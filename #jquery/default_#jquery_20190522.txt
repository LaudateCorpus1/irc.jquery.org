[00:19:16] <pavonia> dopie: What doesn't work?
[04:41:57] <Mdrup> $('td:last', data).clientWidth returns undefined. Any idea why ?
[04:42:21] <Mdrup> data contains a tr element
[04:43:50] <pavonia> What is the second argument for?
[04:44:44] <Mdrup> to specify only td within that particular tr
[04:46:00] <pavonia> As clientWidth is a DOM property, you probably want .get(0).clientWidth
[04:51:55] <Mdrup> pavonia that returns 0
[04:55:34] <thykka> then it's working
[04:58:37] <Mdrup> thykka well i was expecting 250 as i can see when i inspect the element
[04:59:00] <Cork> Mdrup: you want prop('clientWidth')
[04:59:58] <Cork> Mdrup: but remember clientWidth is 0 untill the element is inserted into the page
[05:00:15] <Cork> (as it hasn't been rendered until that happens)
[05:01:31] <thykka> Mdrup, looks good to me, so there must be something else in your code you're not telling about :P https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/0j96yzfw/1/
[05:05:07] <pavonia> Cork: What's the difference between .clientWidth and .prop("clientWidth")?
[05:05:19] <Cork> .prop() works on jquery objects
[05:06:08] <Cork> .prop stands for properties and that is what clientWidth scrollHeight and so on are
[05:08:13] <pavonia> So no functional difference but just better style?
[05:08:46] <Cork> .get(0)[propertyName] === .prop(propertyName)
[05:09:35] <pavonia> Okay
[05:10:13] <Cork> pavonia: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/prop.js#L55
[09:09:02] <hollusion> what exactly is jquery doing to the data object in a $.ajax() request?
[09:09:10] <hollusion> sometimes it messes up my data object
[09:09:17] <hollusion> forcing me to manually JSON.stringify()
[09:09:27] <hollusion> and .parse() on the server side
[09:13:11] <hollusion> "By default, data passed in to the data option as an object (technically, anything other than a string) will be processed and transformed into a query string, fitting to the default content-type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". If you want to send a DOMDocument, or other non-processed data, set this option to false."
[09:13:22] <hollusion> how would the data be sent when i set this to false?
[09:31:18] <Cork> hollusion: it gets sent raw
[09:31:30] <Cork> so what you give is what is sent, even if it wouldn't be valid
[09:47:26] <hollusion> thank you
[16:23:12] <Toerkeium> Hey, hello
[16:23:18] <robertmaxrees> Hello
[16:24:04] <Toerkeium> I'm having trouble understanding why my script doesn't work. It's a focusin vs a click event, which triggers a datePicker. focusin works, click, no. Any idea why? https://jsfiddle.net/tqm70dbn/37/
[16:24:22] <robertmaxrees> click works for me.
[16:24:37] <Toerkeium> really?
[16:24:42] <Toerkeium> on the icon
[16:24:47] <robertmaxrees> oh the icon.
[16:25:19] <Toerkeium> yes sorry didn't clarify
[16:26:16] <robertmaxrees> well for starters you're re-initializing the datepicker every time, which you don't want.
[16:26:19] <Toerkeium> the function is called, passed the id, but the datepicker is not triggered with no warning or anything else
[16:26:35] <Toerkeium> ahh
[16:26:55] <robertmaxrees> init it, then use http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-show and http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-hide
[16:27:25] <robertmaxrees> second, those two handlers are firing for different elements
[16:28:07] <robertmaxrees> my guess is there's some kind of bubbling going on that's opening and then closing the datepicker.
[16:28:37] <Toerkeium> robertmaxrees: how come? the events are getting the id (one from the current element and the second from its parent)
[16:28:56] <Toerkeium> and I just append the depart-1 or depart-2 to the $("#" + id)
[16:29:33] <robertmaxrees> just giving ideas.
[16:34:58] <Toerkeium> ok, thanks robertmaxrees
[16:51:10] <cek> when doing .append(dom) , dom object containing script elements doesn't execute them.
[16:51:40] <robertmaxrees> that's by design
[16:52:08] <robertmaxrees> iirc
[16:54:14] <cek> HTMLScriptElement to be precise. By design, it supposed to parse and exec strings containing scripts .
[16:54:29] <cek> there' nothing about dom els in docs
[16:56:06] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to append script nodes?
[16:56:41] <robertmaxrees> and with that, I gotta jet.
[16:58:50] <cek> because rails ujs provides preparsed server response, that's why
