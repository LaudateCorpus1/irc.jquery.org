[15:06:07] <botanic> I am having a hard time getting the index of a li item inside a ul, https://jsfiddle.net/ztymcLus/
[15:06:33] <botanic> https://jsfiddle.net/ztymcLus/1/ actually
[15:35:46] <pavonia> botanic: What's the issue exactly?
[15:36:08] <botanic> https://jsfiddle.net/d8otfLqa/1/ im trying to change the "top" css value on the ul based on the hovered over li if anyone has any idea how im screwing this up
[15:36:31] <botanic> pavonia, thats the end result i want to get to =/
[15:39:14] <pavonia> Well, what is `.css("height", "id*-60")` supposed to do?
[15:39:46] <botanic> set the height to the index*-60 on the ul
[15:39:53] <botanic> basically so it scrolls
[15:42:46] <pavonia> That would be a negative height
[15:43:03] <botanic> exactly
[15:43:20] <botanic> so the idea is the ul moves up, basaed on the ui that you are hovered over
[15:44:52] <pavonia> You can't set a negative height, as far as I know, but you can set a negative "top" value with relative or absolute positioning
[15:45:31] <botanic> oh ya it should be top
[15:45:36] <botanic> your right
[15:46:38] <botanic> ya i had top in the html, just put the wrong one in the js, still having issues with making it set the value tho :(
[15:46:58] <pavonia> But I don't really understand what effect you are looking for. If you move the whole <ul> up, the cursor would jump to the next <li>, moving the <ul> even further up
[15:47:51] <botanic> ya im gonna have to make it based on the actual screen location, just doing this as a base test
[15:48:06] <botanic> the screen location math i know how to do
