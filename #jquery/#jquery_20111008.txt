[00:56:32] <whateverb> Hi, how can I make click function work only at first click? Cannot find the right tut for this :/
[01:06:06] <whateverb> here is jsbin for that http://jsbin.com/aqonom/2/edit#source
[01:06:12] <whateverb> maybe someone can help
[01:54:16] <atul> hi
[02:10:55] <Fabryz> with JQuery UI resizable, is it possible to resize toward the top of a div?
[02:10:58] <MagicalBoy> Hello guys
[02:11:19] <MagicalBoy> I am making one comet chat with php and jQuery
[02:11:23] <MagicalBoy> having one problem
[02:11:42] <MagicalBoy> I am sending a listner Request from JQuery Ajax
[02:12:18] <MagicalBoy> and that Query Process unstill server found any new data
[02:15:13] <juha_> comet with php isn't too performant..
[02:16:31] <jita> i have variable var n = $('.track-item.base-song:last-child').clone(), i want to flush its input fields. This is not working $('n :input').val("");. Any idea why ?
[02:17:35] <DThought> jita: $(n).children("input")  might work?
[02:18:52] <jita> DThought: no :(
[02:19:18] <jita> DThought: basically i have copied a form. The input values get copied too if they are filled in
[02:33:22] <Davey> So, a while back I saw a plugin that did search filter tokenizing like this: http://jacobonline.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/mail-search-token-options.png?w=352&h=124
[02:33:45] <Davey> so you type part of the filter name, say "name" and it would auto-complete as a token, then you type the search criteria itself, say "Jennifer"
[02:33:55] <Davey> anyone know of the plugin? I can't find it now.
[02:35:13] <Fabryz> no one knows?
[02:35:56] <Hosteen> Does anyone know of a one step regular expression that can pickup HTML nodes and their attributes reguardless of attribute order?  Like <\w[^>]+name="([^"]*)"[^>]+type="([^"]*)"[^>]*> but able to have "type" come before or after "name" as well as contain more attributes.
[02:48:37] <pvgrif> how to add retard to hover event?
[02:48:54] <Zerks> how
[02:49:54] <pvgrif> how do you
[02:49:59] <whateverb> how can I make function to run only at first click http://jsbin.com/aqonom/2/edit#source
[02:51:36] <jita> i want to append n.append('<a class="rm" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="remove_song(this);">dd</a>');, only if does not exist
[02:51:48] <jita> if it already exists i want to ignore the appending
[02:51:48] <jita> is that possble ?
[02:54:04] <coldhead> i think it is possible jita but it might be hard
[02:54:14] <Hosteen> whateverb: this.onclick = function(){}; anywhere in the click function body will replace all click handlers for the button with an empty function (does nothing).
[02:54:38] <jita> coldhead: how can i remove a element ?
[02:54:49] <jita> coldhead: n.remove('a') doesnt work
[02:55:08] <coldhead> n.find('a').remove()
[02:57:14] <whateverb> Hosteen, http://jsbin.com/aqonom/6/edit#source i tried that but still
[03:00:53] <Zerks> whateverb: how about this? http://jsbin.com/aqonom/7/edit
[03:02:38] <Zerks> whateverb: then when you go to get the id/type, just do $(this).data('id') in that click event function
[03:03:03] <Zerks> though make sure your page itself is actually using html5 too I guess
[03:04:46] <whateverb> Zerks, then how can I access id and type inside jquery function?
[03:05:03] <Zerks> my second message said how
[03:05:20] <whateverb> oh:D
[03:05:25] <Zerks> if your page is using html5, and you supply those data-* attributes in the element, you can do $(this).data('NAME')
[03:06:00] <Zerks> I'm pretty sure jquery doesn't use those attributes for its .data() if the page isn't html5 though
[03:06:20] <Hosteen> whateverb: <a onclick="fun(this,'1','0');"> - in the script section - function fun(obj, id,type) { alert('this is the first click');obj.onclick = function(){}; }
[03:06:56] <Zerks> who needs on click functions when we have event bindings :(
[03:08:12] <sxpert> morning people. is there a better way of writing     var d = $($($("#yearcalendar").children().get(date[1])).children().get(date[2]));
[03:08:15] <Hosteen> whateverb: You proabably don't even need to assign a function, you might be able to assing null or undefined, but I'm not sure
[03:10:24] <jita> Is this the correct syntax, p.remove('a#removel'); ?
[03:10:43] <jita> var p = $('.track-item.base-song:last-child').clone()
[03:11:28] <Zerks> jita:  p.find('a#removel').remove()
[03:11:30] <Zerks> ?remove
[03:11:31] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[03:12:10] <Zerks> actually I wasn't aware you could pass a selector to it, since coldhead fixed your syntax earlier
[03:12:16] <Zerks> yours should be fine then I would assume
[03:14:43] <jita> Zerks: can i append n.append('<a id="removel" class="rm" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="remove_song(this);"></a>'); if it does not exists, if it exists, ignore the append ?
[03:16:36] <Zerks> jita: n.not(":has(#removel)").append('the rest of the code')
[03:16:45] <Zerks> should make sure it doesn't append if it already has it
[03:17:17] <Zerks> wait
[03:17:19] <rgr> correct way to get tge index of the select item in a select element?
[03:17:39] <Zerks> feel like I did that backwards
[03:18:09] <rgr> ark. selectedIndex
[03:18:53] <jita> Zerks: n.not(":has(a#removel)").append('<a id="removel" class="rm" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="remove_song(this);"></a>'); doesnt work :(
[03:18:57] <Zerks> rgr: I don't know about correct but this should also work: $("select").find('option:selected').index()
[03:19:24] <Zerks> jita: I believe I did that backwards. that would only append if it only exists
[03:19:36] <Zerks> if it already exists*
[03:19:51] <jita> Zerks: so whats the correct way ?
[03:21:04] <Zerks> you could do if(n.find('a#removel').length == 0) n.append(
[03:21:14] <Hosteen> Anyone here good at regular expressions?
[03:21:23] <Zerks> I'm alright with them sometimes
[03:21:32] <BinaryKitten> ?ask @ Hosteen
[03:21:32] <bot-t> Hosteen, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:22:01] <Hosteen> BinaryKitten: I did ask it, nobody answered
[03:22:21] <BinaryKitten> didn't see,
[03:22:27] <Zerks> you didn't ask it while I was here :(
[03:22:32] <BinaryKitten> but "anyone good at" gets default reply
[03:22:32] <Hosteen> Zerks: Do you  know of a one step regular expression that can pickup input HTML nodes and their attributes reguardless of attribute order?  Like <\w[^>]+name="([^"]*)"[^>]+type="([^"]*)"[^>]*> but able to have "type" come before or after "name" as well as contain more attributes.
[03:22:42] <rgr> no selectedindex doesnt work. damn google.
[03:22:54] <BinaryKitten> Hosteen my question would be to ask why you are doing this?
[03:22:58] <rgr> Zerks: thanks
[03:22:59] <sxpert> would #item:nth-child(<number>):nth-child(<number>) be correct ?
[03:23:06] <sxpert> or is there a way to do that ?
[03:23:13] <Hosteen> To scrape existing HTML forms for form data
[03:23:33] <jita> Zerks: still does not work
[03:23:46] <BinaryKitten> sxpert  $('#item').children().eq(num).children().eq(num)
[03:24:01] <BinaryKitten> your way might work too
[03:24:03] <sxpert> BinaryKitten: hah ... will test that
[03:24:06] <jita> Zerks: if(n.find('a#removel').length == 0){        n.append('<a id="removel" class="rm" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="remove_song(this);"></a>');     }
[03:24:18] <BinaryKitten> Hosteen what kind of form data?
[03:25:32] <Zerks> jita: if it's not appending, then I would think it already exists within 'n'
[03:25:33] <Hosteen> mixed HTML versions but all valid HTML.  Mostly <table><form><input><////  I just want to know what the inputs are, what type, maxlength etc.  I'm not trying to get the select options, I recognize I'll have to do that in a seperate step
[03:26:08] <jita> Zerks: no it does not exist already
[03:26:10] <BinaryKitten> $('#formid').find('input,select').each ....
[03:26:19] <BinaryKitten> @hosteen
[03:26:20] <Hosteen> I can see having to write pattern X attribute by doing it the way i'm doing now, that sounds stupid so I'm here
[03:26:41] <sxpert> BinaryKitten: thanks
[03:26:56] <Hosteen> sorry that's pattern*attribute
[03:27:12] <BinaryKitten> get the form, find all inputs and selects and iterate over them Hosteen, the "this" in the each will be element, which you can ask for "type"
[03:27:14] <BinaryKitten> or "tagname"
[03:27:57] <jita> Zerks: http://dpaste.com/630239/
[03:28:06] <BinaryKitten> Hosteen interrogate the domNodes, don't regex them
[03:28:18] <Hosteen> I can't access the DOM when this pattern is running, I must treat it purely as a string - a constraint that I don't want but I have to live with
[03:28:34] <BinaryKitten> you can't access the dom? how come?
[03:28:48] <Hosteen> this is running on the server in a C# script
[03:29:03] <sxpert> BinaryKitten: works like a champ ;)
[03:29:12] <BinaryKitten> ok so you're asking in a jquery channel for c# regex help?
[03:29:20] <Hosteen> I know...
[03:29:46] <Hosteen> I also know where to go to get real help though
[03:30:04] <Zerks> hmm
[03:30:08] * Zerks tries a test expression
[03:30:10] <Davey> Hey BK :)
[03:30:15] <BinaryKitten> sorry i can't help you more Hosteen
[03:30:25] <BinaryKitten> hey Davey
[03:30:27] <Hosteen> thanks for the help thus far
[03:31:36] <BinaryKitten> Hosteen you might be get better help in #regex
[03:31:43] <jita> Zerks: my bad, css style missing for a link :(. Thanks a lot for your help
[03:32:14] <Zerks> I might have an expression
[03:32:37] <Hosteen> BinaryKitten: thanks for the tip - I didn't know there was such a place
[03:32:44] <BinaryKitten> :) no wories :)
[03:33:02] <BinaryKitten> If i can't help the least i can do is try to point you in the right direction
[03:33:08] <Hosteen> BinaryKitten: If it makes you feel less dirty the form is spit into JSON and it's 100% jquery from there
[03:33:33] <Hosteen> Zerks: I'm waiting with bated breath
[03:33:39] <BinaryKitten> not really dirty or such, just i know that c# regex isn't the same as js regex
[03:33:49] <Hosteen> it's almost 100% the same
[03:34:12] <Hosteen> it also has a ECMAScript mode for purists like yourself
[03:34:16] <Zerks> I'm doing php regex so I sure hope that's the same
[03:34:40] * BinaryKitten is a PHP dev
[03:34:46] * BinaryKitten is far from a purist
[03:34:47] <Hosteen> Mostly the MS versions have extra BS, so it should work
[03:34:51] <BinaryKitten> far far far far far far
[03:35:16] <Hosteen> An assumption - but it will work the same if you want it to.
[03:35:45] <Hosteen> My difficulty is getting the expression to work even when the attributes are in different orders
[03:36:33] <Hosteen> Sure you can see it's an attribute match[0], but WHICH attribute?  I've been doing regex for 10 years and I still feel like a noob
[03:51:49] <NodeX> anyone use uploadify ?
[04:23:56] <krz> anyone know how this can be done: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7696460/how-to-check-file-nme-for-non-ascii-characters-via-js

[04:32:45] <jita> i have to make alteration to the division before appending
[04:32:51] <jita> so i have to store it in a variable
[04:34:16] <krz> or does anyone know how to check for non-ascii characters in a string?

[05:13:26] <hidensoft> hi
[05:14:57] <erichynds> hi
[05:15:28] <hidensoft> there is anyway to select all element with array name ? this code "var allInputs = $('input[name='+name+']');" work fine but when name = myfields[check] does not work , any idea ?
[05:16:25] <erichynds> what is the value of myfields[check] ?
[05:17:30] <hidensoft> erichynds, value is not matter , i just wanna select all element with name like myfields[check]
[05:18:25] <erichynds> oh, right
[05:18:29] <erichynds> ?escaping @ hidensoft
[05:18:29] <bot-t> hidensoft, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[05:19:21] <hidensoft> erichynds, thanks i try this
[05:25:05] <hidensoft> erichynds, its work :)
[05:25:13] <erichynds> yayyy
[05:25:20] <K1ng> how do i select name?
[05:25:33] <K1ng> $('name=[milestone_percentage]') ?
[05:25:52] <erichynds> you should put milestone_percentage in double quotes
[05:25:54] <erichynds> but yes
[05:26:12] <gnarf> $("[name='milestone_percentage']")
[05:26:25] <K1ng> thanks a lot :D
[05:27:13] <K1ng> TypeError: $("[name='milestone_percentage']") is null
[05:27:38] <erichynds> jQuery never returns a null value
[05:27:50] <erichynds> sounds like $ isn't what you think it is
[05:28:10] <K1ng> oh its jq
[05:30:38] <hidensoft> erichynds, did you have a function to escape meta-characters automatically ?
[05:31:13] <erichynds> hidensoft: I don't, but there's probably one out there
[05:31:48] <hidensoft> :D

[06:35:47] <Woet> or don't you care about that? :p
[06:35:53] <aLinux> how can i do DELETE request /
[06:36:01] <nail_> aLinux: that way this is called as soon as the dom is ready
[06:36:54] <Lochlan> aLinux: u need to use cmd:
[06:36:57] <Lochlan> you?
[06:37:05] <aLinux> which cmd ?
[07:19:23] <juha_> porkchop sandwiches
[07:19:30] <juha_> oh shit get the fuck out of here
[07:22:07] <HarryPitfall> pork is the meat of kings!
[08:16:22] <zmbmartin> Looking for some advice. I have a form with around 450 to 500 fields and I am doing some calculation by each section with about 100 fields per section roughly. When I fill in fields my cpu process run really high. Any ideas or thought on getting that under control or is that because of all the fields?
[08:18:24] <erichynds> zmbmartin: are you doing DOM manipulation as well?
[08:18:58] <erichynds> zmbmartin: you could try chunking w/ recursive setTimeouts, but I dunno if that'll help your CPU any
[08:19:27] <zmbmartin> erichynds: Yes some, just entering the results per section then the total.
[08:20:09] <erichynds> zmbmartin: you could also try something like this: https://gist.github.com/938767
[08:21:50] <zmbmartin> erichynds: ok I will look at that. Without doing something like that is it just because I have so many fields?
[08:22:08] <erichynds> zmbmartin: yeah. it also depends on how your selectors are setup as well
[08:22:47] <erichynds> zmbmartin: dunno what your code looks like, but try selecting all inputs at once, caching it into a var, and referencing the cached var instead of going to the DOM multiple times
[08:24:36] <zmbmartin> erichynds: ok here is what I have --> https://gist.github.com/1272424
[08:24:53] <zmbmartin> I am going over the DOM multiple times
[08:25:02] <zmbmartin> quite a bit.
[08:25:19] <erichynds> yeahh
[08:25:27] <erichynds> use .delegate() instead of live()
[08:25:37] <erichynds> see if you can factor this out         $('.' + field + ' span').text(total);
[08:26:13] <erichynds> each click you're doing a lot of DOM traversing instead of referencing cached elems
[08:26:19] <erichynds> which is preferred, if possible
[08:27:40] <zmbmartin> erichynds: ok I will work on that thanks
[08:30:55] <zmbmartin> erichynds: not sure I understand delegate. will that cut down some cpu or should I focus more on caching the elements?
[08:31:11] <erichynds> focus on caching elems
[08:32:19] <warrenparsons> erichynds: Caching and delegation primarily serve two distinct purposes.
[08:32:19] <bot-t> (11 hours 10 mins ago) <coldhead> tell warrenparsons i will never forget you
[08:32:30] <erichynds> i know that
[08:32:41] <erichynds> those were 2 separate recommendations
[08:32:53] <pr0ton> so i have a $('xyz')
[08:32:56] <warrenparsons> Crap, sorry. Meant to address that at zmbmartin
[08:33:08] <warrenparsons> Not enough coffee in me yet.
[08:33:10] <pr0ton> i need to convert it into the object i get from, document.getElementById
[08:33:11] <pr0ton> any ideas ?
[08:33:26] <zmbmartin> warrenparsons: what do you mean?
[08:33:31] <zmbmartin> what are you getting at/.
[08:33:53] <erichynds> pr0ton: $("xyz")[0]
[08:34:15] <warrenparsons> Probably nothing. I came into the conversation late. Just that you asked whether delegation or caching would help you more, and I answered without fully undertstanding your issue. Listen to erichynds.
[08:34:39] <zmbmartin> warrenparsons: Oh I see. Thanks
[08:35:29] <pr0ton> erichynds, thanks, i just searched and got $(xyz).get(0);
[08:35:44] <erichynds> pr0ton: yep, that's another way to do it.

[08:41:06] <warrenparsons> With the 4S coming out soon, people will be dumping their old ones on the used market. Maybe build $300 into your contract to cover a purchase for testing.
[08:41:24] <pr0ton> Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html. - i get this in chrome
[08:41:30] <pr0ton> i'm NOT using a server?
[08:41:31] <warrenparsons> You can still use it on wifi without a service contract.
[08:41:31] <NodeX> seems a terrible waste of money
[08:41:39] <pr0ton> i'm doing everything locally, pure JS project
[08:41:45] <warrenparsons> Or buy a cheap iPod Touch.
[08:42:19] <warrenparsons> NodeX: Only if you don't see yourself needing to make more sites iPhone compatible in the future.
[08:42:52] <NodeX> ipod touch might be the way to go
[08:43:01] <NodeX> do they update to the latest ios etc
[08:43:24] <warrenparsons> Seems you get can get the low end Touches on Craigslist for under $150.
[08:43:31] <warrenparsons> They should.
[08:43:42] <warrenparsons> But I'd read up on the model I was considering first.
[08:43:45] <warrenparsons> To be sure.
[08:44:16] <warrenparsons> And watch out for counterfeits.
[08:44:32] <BlaDe^> NodeX: yeah they do
[08:44:43] <BlaDe^> I'm an iOS enthusiast... from reverse engineering to development
[08:44:44] <NodeX> He'll have to buy me one then lol
[08:44:56] <NodeX> all because it doesn't support flash lol
[08:45:03] <BlaDe^> for good reason
[08:45:18] <warrenparsons> NodeX: It'll be helpful to get more used to accommodating touch events in your JS, too.
[08:45:26] <NodeX> good point
[08:45:29] <warrenparsons> Those apply to tablets as well.
[08:46:05] <BlaDe^> I'd go with a 4th gen ipod touch if I were you NodeX
[08:46:16] <BlaDe^> though really you could get a 3rd gen if you only want safari...
[08:46:32] <BlaDe^> 3rd gen wont support iOS 5 afaik, but I don't know if they've made major updates to mobile safari
[08:46:37] <NodeX> is there a major difference
[08:46:47] <NodeX> or is it just weight / size
[08:46:56] <BlaDe^> it's the speed which limits it from getting the newer os
[08:46:59] <warrenparsons> Safari in iOS5 finally supports position:fixed;
[08:47:03] <BlaDe^> he iPhone 3g wont get iOS5 either
[08:47:15] <warrenparsons> And since iOS users upgrade pretty quickly, you'll probably want to take advantage of it.
[08:47:27] <NodeX> I would be better getting the least one then make everything work on that and it will be future proof no ?
[08:47:28] <BlaDe^> yeah, i agree. that's why I think 4th gen
[08:47:55] <BlaDe^> NodeX: well iOS 5 is gonna be around a long time, a 4th gen is perfect for you
[08:48:18] <NodeX> found some on Amazon UK for £160
[08:48:31] <NodeX> that's about $250 USD
[08:48:44] <warrenparsons> NodeX: Just to reiterate, watch out for counterfeits. But that sounds like it could be a new price.
[08:48:54] <BlaDe^> my mistake NodeX
[08:49:01] <BlaDe^> 3rd gen is fine, it supports iOS 5 just checked
[08:49:02] <BlaDe^> http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Apple-iPod-Touch-8GB-3rd-generation-Whilst-Stocks-Last-/200637730334?pt=UK_AudioTVElectronics_PortableAudio_MP3Players&hash=item2eb6f0ce1e#ht_1324wt_1144
[08:49:03] <NodeX> is there alot of counterfiets ?
[08:49:12] <BlaDe^> £99.95 refurbished
[08:49:14] <BlaDe^> you can't go wrong
[08:49:20] <butterfly> Hi, I have a simple problem. I load the menu with ajax(/jquery), but i cannot after refer to this menu with jquery
[08:50:11] <NodeX> better with refurb I spose
[08:50:18] <NodeX> cheaper for the client :D
[08:50:48] <warrenparsons> And if you're like me, now you're thinking "man, it'd be nice to have a shiny new one" in the back of your head. It's dangerous.
[08:50:57] <NodeX> heh
[08:51:02] <Cameron> $('.feature a img.featureimg').mouseover() < should that work?
[08:51:10] <NodeX> I wont use it for anythign else .. I has a nice ANdriod phone
[08:51:11] <Cameron> with the class specifier bit?
[08:51:22] <BlaDe^> I pre-ordered a 4S yesterday ;)
[08:51:57] <NodeX> Cameron : yes but it's ambiguous
[08:52:05] <Cameron> meaning?
[08:52:10] <warrenparsons> Cameron: It should. But it won't work as a trigger, if that's what you're trying to do.
[08:52:12] <NodeX> meaning give it context
[08:52:13] <warrenparsons> It's only a handler.
[08:52:29] <Cameron> i have a document.ready thing around it
[08:52:35] <NodeX> $(' img.featureimg',$('.feature a')).mouseover()
[08:52:47] <Cameron> ok
[08:52:50] <warrenparsons> Cameron: Are you trying to trigger a mouseover event, or fire a function there?
[08:52:57] <NodeX> $('.img.featureimg',$('.feature a')).mouseover(function(event){ do your stuff}));
[08:53:42] <Cameron> http://vermilionsite.com/phone/ go there, select iphone4s then choose from scratch ($300)
[08:53:56] <Cameron> then it shows images of ipgone backings
[08:54:05] <Cameron> i want it so when you hover over them it alerts you for now
[08:54:20] <BlaDe__> ok.. so back on topic... I'm adding drag/drop upload support to a site, and we have a typical <input type="file" /> already
[08:54:27] <NodeX> you need a live bind i woudl imagine
[08:54:40] <NodeX> BlaDe__ : pastebin your code
[08:54:47] <warrenparsons> Yeah, Cameron you need delegation here.
[08:54:58] <Cameron> so like what NodeX suggested?
[08:55:09] <ravenzz> Cameron $('.featureimg').mouseover()
[08:55:15] <NodeX> Cameron : pastebin your code
[08:55:18] <Cameron> ok
[08:55:30] <ravenzz> btw i would suggest you to create an unordered list
[08:55:33] <NodeX> you need a live bind
[08:55:39] <ravenzz> instead of divs
[08:55:53] <NodeX> nice to see more people using nginx &&varnish :)
[08:56:09] <Cameron> oh
[08:56:11] <Cameron> *ok
[08:56:29] <BlaDe__> if you drag/drop onto the input then it populates the input, I want it to trigger my drag handlers instead.... can I do that?
[08:56:30] <BlaDe__> seems down here Cameron
[08:56:44] <Cameron> http://pastebin.com/kQczS0wS
[08:57:16] <Cameron> its got php in it
[08:57:16] <NodeX> you can stop the even bubbling to its default BlaDe__
[08:57:34] <Cameron> i just want an alert when you hover over it
[08:57:38] <Cameron> actaully
[08:57:42] <Cameron> i'll just use normal js
[08:57:48] <ravenzz> <image  <-
[08:57:49] <ravenzz> wtf
[08:58:17] <NodeX> Cameron : do the images comes from an Ajax request?
[08:58:21] <Cameron> yeah
[08:58:32] <Cameron> well if thats what you call ajax
[08:58:45] <Cameron> its just php gd
[08:58:46] <NodeX> xmlhttprequest *
[08:58:53] <Cameron> no
[08:58:54] <ravenzz> that isn't ajax
[08:59:58] <NodeX> so where do the images appear from then
[08:59:59] <NodeX> lol
[09:00:53] <ravenzz> NodeX did you take a look at the pastebin?
[09:01:00] <Cameron> dont worry about it
[09:01:06] <Cameron> im just using normal js now
[09:01:13] <Cameron> i think its actually better
[09:01:19] <Cameron> i was just being stupid before
[09:01:23] <NodeX> yes but I also took a look at his link and the source of it and watched the Ajax requests grabbing
[09:01:47] <Cameron> yes NodeX theres some ajax
[09:01:55] <Cameron> but thats irrelevant to wat my problem was
[09:03:20] <ravenzz> Cameron no, It could be relevant
[09:03:52] <NodeX> if the images -were- being loaded by ajax then any handlers bound to them wont be valid unless they were "live" which is why IO was trying to ascertain it lol
[09:03:57] <NodeX> IO -> I
[09:04:34] <waldi_de> hi
[09:06:32] <waldi_de> Do somebody speak german here?
[09:11:17] <ravenzz> Cameron I would suggest you to make a mask of the iphone, and then change the bg color
[09:11:28] <ravenzz> instead of those complicated stuffs
[09:11:44] <ravenzz> (color.php?c=FFFFFF)
[09:11:54] <Cameron> yeah but theres gonna be more stuff
[09:14:16] <ravenzz> Cameron http://jsfiddle.net/ycqxA/
[09:14:34] <ravenzz> or just use custom data attributes (html5)
[09:14:45] <Cameron> that wont work
[09:14:54] <Cameron> because the idea is the admins upload images
[09:15:06] <Cameron> and then are able to change the colour
[09:15:13] <Cameron> but there could be 10 images overlaying each othe
[09:17:08] <ravenzz> what? the data attribute one or the fiddle?
[09:18:15] <thun> If I set a var on document load say blah = "w/e";  Should I be able to access the blah value from another javascript file included on the page?
[09:20:17] <warrenparsons> thun: Only if that access takes place after the var is set.
[09:21:03] <warrenparsons> So if your var is set in a doc ready, but then your next included JS file doesn't wait for a doc ready to try reading it, it doesn't work.
[09:22:36] <BlaDe^> Is there something liek var.in('a', 'b', 'c') ?
[09:24:05] <thun> ah ok
[09:24:12] <thun> let me play wit hit
[09:24:53] <thun> how do i wait until doc ready to set a function
[09:25:00] <ravenzz> Cameron http://jsfiddle.net/ycqxA/1/
[09:25:09] <thun> i have the doc ready call but then my functions outside of it
[09:25:12] <thun> i think that is the problem
[09:25:33] <warrenparsons> thun: You can define your funtions before the doc ready. Just don't fire them until then.
[09:26:17] <Cameron> oooh
[09:29:38] <Cameron> ravenzz
[09:30:34] <Cameron> that still wont wor
[09:30:41] <thun> how do view all variable available to me
[09:30:46] <thun> is there a way to dump all set variables
[09:36:48] <Cameron> http://vermilionsite.com/phone/
[09:37:17] <Cameron> so now i want it to hange the src of the .mainimg when you hover over it
[09:37:27] <Cameron> it gets the data but it doenst change the src
[09:40:16] <warrenparsons> Cameron: I don't see any place where you're firing the hovered3 function.
[09:40:41] <Cameron> yeah, choose iphone4s from the dropdown
[09:40:47] <Cameron> then select the first link
[09:40:50] <Cameron> then youll see it
[09:41:55] <warrenparsons> Ah, I see.
[09:43:41] <carl0> Someone could tell me why history.back does not keep the form data?
[09:45:28] <Spadeski> Can  I get some help please if ya someone doesnt mind ?
[09:46:40] <Cameron> iany idea warrenparsons
[09:46:49] <warrenparsons> Still looking.
[09:47:09] <Cameron> ok
[09:47:10] <warrenparsons> I'm so unused to inline scripting anymore, it's tough to debug.
[09:59:01] <warrenparsons> Cameron: something's up with your AJAX request. I think it's failing. When I try to just fire an alert with the same mouseover, it works.
[09:59:09] <Cameron> oh ok
[09:59:52] <warrenparsons> I think $.get fails silently. So it never fires your success callback.
[10:01:42] <aniasis|karega> why doesn't the jq ui toggleClass have the switch parameter?
[10:04:36] <warrenparsons> Cameron: this worked in Firebug's console:
[10:04:37] <warrenparsons> $.ajax({
[10:04:37] <warrenparsons>   url: 'ajax.php?a=color&id='+id,
[10:04:38] <warrenparsons>   success: function(){alert('worked')},
[10:04:38] <warrenparsons>   error: function(){alert('error found')}
[10:04:38] <warrenparsons> });
[10:05:11] <warrenparsons> In the mouseover.
[10:05:35] <warrenparsons> So your request might be okay.
[10:08:33] <warrenparsons> I found the issue
[10:08:41] <warrenparsons> I think.
[10:09:11] <warrenparsons> Your ajax request is returning the following for ID 1 - 0080FF
[10:09:35] <warrenparsons> Yeah, all it's returning are hex codes. And you're trying to set the source of your image to that.
[10:12:08] <warrenparsons> This works:
[10:12:13] <warrenparsons> function hovered3(id){
[10:12:13] <warrenparsons> $.ajax({
[10:12:13] <warrenparsons>   url: 'ajax.php?a=color&id='+id,
[10:12:14] <warrenparsons>   success: function(data){
[10:12:14] <warrenparsons>     $('.mainimg').attr("src", 'color.php?c='+data);
[10:12:14] <warrenparsons> },
[10:12:15] <warrenparsons>   error: function(){alert('error found')}
[10:12:15] <warrenparsons> });
[10:12:15] <warrenparsons> }
[10:12:57] <warrenparsons> This is a better place for it - http://pastebin.com/DaMEt34K
[10:13:37] <DNX> hi guys, is there a possibility in jquery or javascript to know when the user has changed the focus outside of current browser window? $('body').hover() doesn't work always...
[10:14:10] <warrenparsons> DNX: You could try window.blur
[10:14:32] <warrenparsons> Not sure if it'll work, but it's the obvious choice.
[10:14:44] <DNX> immediately
[10:16:49] <dross> I'm curious why comments are disabled on the API pages
[10:16:51] <dross> this is retarded
[10:17:54] <ajpiano> we disabled comments on the api docs because there was a very very low ratio of signal to noise
[10:18:08] <ajpiano> and largely the comments ended up just being misdirected support requests
[10:18:27] <warrenparsons> DNX: blur doesn't seem to work. It might be a security/privacy thing. It's probably not a good idea anyway.
[10:18:56] <ajpiano> DNX: http://code.google.com/chrome/whitepapers/pagevisibility.html
[10:19:19] <DNX> warrenparsons, i found window.onblur() I'm testing it now
[10:19:39] <dross> ajpiano: the content of good API pages are user comments
[10:19:42] <dross> just like php.net
[10:19:52] <dross> though many don't understand this
[10:20:43] <dross> ajpiano: perhaps changing the system to a moderated queue would create better results
[10:20:51] <dross> useful tidbits are great on API pages
[10:21:08] <ajpiano> we didn't really have the bandwidth to monitor the volume of comments really
[10:21:22] <dross> don't you mean people, not bandwidth?
[10:21:30] <ajpiano> i mean the people bandwidth
[10:21:31] <ajpiano> yes
[10:21:32] <ajpiano> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/01/30/api-documentation-changes/
[10:22:12] <dross> you realize some people would gladly volunteer to moderate a queue
[10:22:28] <ajpiano> are you one of them :)
[10:22:39] <dross> I am
[10:22:43] <THEtheChad> Quick question for you guys. I created a csshook to override a specific property built into jquery but $.css doesn't use my new object. I can still access the object directly from $.cssHooks so I know it exists. What's going on?
[10:22:53] <dross> though, I suppose some type of system would need to be built first
[10:23:09] <dross> it would give an opportunity for people to also learn jquery
[10:23:14] <dross> esp for those who are beginners
[10:23:47] <dross> If you've ever used PHP, you'd have used php.net, one of the most helpful resources are examples left in user comments
[10:24:01] <ajpiano> yeah, a lot of people mention php.net in this conversation
[10:24:11] <ajpiano> (as you may be able to tell, this isn't the first time i've had it :) )
[10:24:19] <juha_> yay bananas are yellow!
[10:24:21] <dross> indeed
[10:24:32] <dross> juha_: in some countries, they're green and red
[10:24:32] <pvgrif> how can i get an element's window coordinates? not document's
[10:24:33] <ajpiano> are there other projects besides php.net that have documentation comments
[10:24:43] <ajpiano> i think that it's the exception to the rule
[10:24:48] <dross> ajpiano: none which I can think
[10:25:00] <dross> ajpiano: I've often called ruby people morons for not having a proper site like php.net
[10:25:04] <dross> it's rather infuriating
[10:25:16] * dross utilizes ruby a great deal
[10:25:24] <warrenparsons> dross: Yes, I'm sure being called a moron would be infuriating.
[10:25:29] <DNX> warrenparsons, I think $('body').hover rests the best solution in my case... :| thank you
[10:25:30] <ajpiano> i'm sure ruby people call php people morons for having a language like php :)
[10:25:41] <dross> I dislike PHP, I love the documentation
[10:25:49] <dross> the documentation is absolute bliss
[10:25:58] <juha_> dross: WITCH!
[10:26:06] <aniasis|karega> ajpiano, is there a jq ui that has a switch parameter on the toggleClass?
[10:26:08] <warrenparsons> DNX: Glad you got it sorted out.
[10:26:18] <juha_> dirty heretic
[10:26:18] <dross> much surrounding ruby 10 years ago... surrounded mockery about the lack of documentation
[10:26:34] <ajpiano> dross: i'd be happy to help you get more involved in helping out with jQ docs
[10:26:44] <pvgrif> so which one of you fine gentleman would be kind enough to enlighten me as to how i can get an element's screen/window coordinatees and not document's coordinates
[10:26:50] <warrenparsons> dross: Horrible documentation is what turned me off Rails a few years ago.
[10:26:58] <dross> I'd love to help
[10:27:01] <ajpiano> mind pming me your e-mail?
[10:27:09] <dross> get me access to the code, I'll build a moderation queue
[10:27:16] <ajpiano> i think the problem with the comments as-is is that they're still *there*
[10:27:24] <ajpiano> which makes for bizarre optics
[10:27:37] <dross> will need a reporting system for all approved comments
[10:28:00] <dross> for head admins to make sure spam isn't going to get approved
[10:28:15] <ajpiano> dross: are you suggesting that everything is moderated by default?
[10:28:24] <dross> indeed
[10:28:30] <ajpiano> no matter your posting frequency, etc?
[10:28:40] <dross> trusted users can get approved
[10:28:57] <THEtheChad> Here, I've thrown it into a jsfiddle ... I'm not getting the return I expect http://jsfiddle.net/THEtheChad/9pG8w/
[10:28:57] <dross> can work just like livejournal, I'm an admin of a group there too
[10:30:26] <ajpiano> i'm not sure at this point if enabling them is a done deal
[10:30:43] <dross> you can't just enable them
[10:30:59] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:31:00] <dross> a proper comment system needs to be implemented, not just some vanilla system
[10:31:14] <ajpiano> well we have disqus, there's an admin interface, etc.
[10:31:33] <ajpiano> i'm talking to karl now - he's the head of docs
[10:31:54] <dross> my type of jobs, I always have idle time
[10:32:10] <dross> maybe it's time I started contributing more to open source projects which I've used
[10:32:18] <ajpiano> his daughter is pestering him at the moment, i think he's gonna hop in here in a half hour or so
[10:32:29] <ajpiano> heh - amen to tht
[10:33:01] <ajpiano> i just gave the talk on "getting involved in jquery" at jqcon this past weekend so i am hoping to foster people along when they show some initiative :)
[10:33:08] <dross> 30 minutes I'll be interviewing
[10:33:14] <dross> looking for work x.x
[10:33:25] <ajpiano> ah!
[10:33:30] <dross> yes, on a saturday, I work with very dedicated individuals :-)
[10:33:31] <ajpiano> well, best of luck with that
[10:33:55] <Eviltwin> What kind of work?
[10:34:00] <dross> dross - ingredients: 1 cup genious, 2 cups crazy
[10:34:08] <dross> Eviltwin: systems engineering
[10:34:27] <dross> In a way, i'm a "jack of all trades" in IT, but I'm great at all of it
[10:34:41] <dross> I'd prefer to focus on network engineering, haven't gotten that chance yet
[10:34:59] <dross> I need to finish up my studies on Cisco gear and take the CCIE tests
[10:35:15] <dross> I've all the books and programs, I just need to finish on my own time.
[10:35:19] <ajpiano> dross: if you are around when we gets back, we can all chat then
[10:35:29] <dross> ajpiano: alright, sounds good.
[10:35:44] <ajpiano> if not, any time during the week should be ok, mostly we're around
[10:36:12] <ajpiano> would love to find a way to get you more involved in docs - or sysadmin or whatever you liek
[10:40:21] <THEtheChad> For anyone that's been AFK, I'm trying to override a csshook and am not getting the expected return. Here's a JS fiddle to illustrate http://jsfiddle.net/THEtheChad/9pG8w/ ... any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong?
[10:44:30] <dabear> THEtheChad: http://jsfiddle.net/9pG8w/1/
[10:46:01] <THEtheChad> dabear: Ohhh, interesting! Thank you so much! Where does jquery translate box-shadow to boxShadow?
[10:47:07] <dabear> THEtheChad: no idea how to answer that
[10:47:09] <warrenparsons> THEtheChad: It's not jQuery so much as JS. Property/var names cannot have hyphens, so they get converted to camelCase.
[10:47:11] <dabear> look in the source?
[10:50:00] <THEtheChad> warrenparsons: I see.... Will run some more tests. Thanks for the info!
[11:03:35] <Spadeski>  how come most my animations lag?
[11:04:05] <THEtheChad> Spadeski: That depends. Can you post an example on jsfiddle.net?
[11:04:32] <Spadeski> umm better http://gotactics.net hit the Account tab in the middle
[11:05:10] <warrenparsons> The animation looks pretty smooth here.
[11:05:25] <harmoniser> Hi, can somebody tell me why this will only produce an output the first time the timer triggers: setInterval(function() {    document.write($('.p_item')[0].id);     }, 7000);
[11:05:57] <ajpiano> harmoniser: every time you do document.write() it obliterates the entire document
[11:06:34] <harmoniser> gosh
[11:06:41] <harmoniser> so that's what it is
[11:07:00] <harmoniser> I have been going nuts on this. thanks.
[11:07:03] <warrenparsons> .append() would probably work a little more in line with what you're trying to do.
[11:09:14] <THEtheChad> Spadeski: What browser are you viewing it on? I'm using chrome and it looks smooth, just like warrenparsons said.
[11:09:48] <Spadeski> Oh mozilla must be hardware
[11:09:51] <Spadeski> old computer
[11:10:11] <Spadeski> The Chad wanna see the update I made for that ?
[11:11:06] <THEtheChad> Spadeski: Update for what?
[11:11:50] <Spadeski> The website
[11:15:29] <killerbane> hello guys, is it possible to paginate listview with json data when a user user scrolls in jquery mobile ??
[11:16:16] <THEtheChad> Spadeski: sure.
[11:16:57] <Spadeski> THEtheChad http://209.172.30.208/WWWRoot
[11:19:15] <THEtheChad> Spadeski: It's loading a bit slow for me. I like your layout. Should hit me up when you get finished ;-)
[11:21:20] <Aquaguy> hey
[11:21:20] <Aquaguy> is there any way to make text-overflow: ellipsis work for input elements?
[11:32:07] <dross> well
[11:32:11] <dross> that interview went rather well
[11:32:23] <warrenparsons> dross: congrats
[11:32:54] <dross> I just wish I could get a job as a UX designer instead of my typical jack of all trades systems and network engineering work
[11:33:24] <warrenparsons> dross: Where are you located?
[11:33:34] <dross> trapped in Morgantown, WV
[11:33:55] <dross> a client decided to cut a contract short after moving me here, oh how it is to feel used.
[11:34:03] <warrenparsons> Doesn't sound like webdev central. Of course, neither did Toledo before I moved here.
[11:34:34] <dross> This isn't the place I look forward to be staying, I'm most likely moving soon
[11:34:38] <dross> after I find a job
[11:35:15] <dross> warrenparsons: how did you come to be in Toledo? :-)
[11:35:33] <warrenparsons> A recruiter found me online when I was living in the Detroit area.
[11:35:45] <pendergast> anyone happen to have a link handy that shows correct Ajax-enabled sortable? I can only find examples where the whole list is serialised, which causes an excess of db row updates
[11:36:02] <dross> warrenparsons: odd
[11:36:24] <dross> warrenparsons: random recruiter or a known company?
[11:36:30] <warrenparsons> dross: It was through my poorly-maintained LinkeIn account, too.
[11:36:39] <dross> :|
[11:36:47] <warrenparsons> dross: I'd never heard of the company before. But they're pretty much the balls in this area.
[11:36:54] <dross> recruiters usually ask me for advice from LinkedIn
[11:37:51] <warrenparsons> Smaller agency, was about 55 people when I started 3 years ago, around 110 now. I was working for a 1500 employee agency in Detroit when they found me.
[11:41:29] * dross growls
[11:41:41] <aro> RAWR
[11:43:37] <aro> can you just drop in cake2.0?
[11:43:54] <aro> or does it require a lot of reconfiguration
[11:47:35] <slaeke> hey all
[11:47:40] <slaeke> i have an interesting problem
[11:47:53] <slaeke> was hoping one of you might have run into it before
[11:48:01] <aro> thats a mean thing to say
[11:48:12] <slaeke> chrome is giving me the wrong value of css('left')
[11:48:18] <aro> thats like saying, i have some horrible disease and i was hoping one of you had it
[11:48:25] <slaeke> its adding 30px to the value that is shown in the inline style
[11:48:29] <slaeke> haha
[11:48:47] <slaeke> thing it, I'm not sure I can show the code
[11:48:52] <slaeke> its something for work
[11:48:55] <slaeke> and its confidential
[11:49:04] <slaeke> so I was hoping to get away with just describing the problem
[11:49:19] <aro> show the code
[11:49:31] <aro> where do you work
[11:49:37] <slaeke> capital one
[11:49:44] <aro> fuck capital one
[11:49:47] <slaeke> i'm a ui designer
[11:49:49] <aro> they hate everyone
[11:49:52] <slaeke> heh
[11:49:53] <slaeke> not their designers
[11:49:56] <slaeke> they like us
[11:49:59] <aro> i worked at GE
[11:50:03] <aro> i quit that hellhole
[11:50:28] <slaeke> so basically, here's the situation
[11:50:36] <aro> jsfiddle.net
[11:50:42] <slaeke> i'm trying to calculate the right edge of an <li>
[11:50:52] <slaeke> bah
[11:50:58] <slaeke> the actual code is on my work laptop
[11:50:58] <aro> hey
[11:50:59] <aro> it helps
[11:51:09] <aro> so how are you gonna test it
[11:51:14] <slaeke> ok, lemme go get the work laptop
[11:51:18] <aro> ok
[11:51:22] <slaeke> brb
[11:51:47] <aro> ok
[11:53:38] <slaeke> ok have the work lap boting up
[11:53:48] <slaeke> will make a jsfiddle
[11:53:58] <aro> okay
[11:54:00] <slaeke> with it and put a screenshot on imgur
[11:54:18] <slaeke> thats about the best I can do since i can't show the page...heh
[12:02:14] <dabear> assume var number = somenumber; how can I then get the last char of that number the fastest? 1=>1 ,32=>2, 435=>5 etc
[12:02:19] <dabear> currently using String.prototype.substr.call(number, -1)
[12:02:33] <dabear> some clever bitshifting?
[12:03:40] <dabear> asked in ##javascript instead :)
[12:04:07] <dross> warrenparsons: may you PM me the company? :-)
[12:04:17] <dross> warrenparsons: trying to increase my odds to finding a position faster
[12:06:10] <slaeke> ok aro
[12:06:14] <slaeke> the imgur screens are up
[12:06:23] <l2trace99> when using a listview in jquery mobile is there anyway to execute  the <script> tags  ?
[12:06:37] <slaeke> imgur.com/a/8TXeu
[12:06:44] <slaeke> jsfiddle coming next
[12:06:54] <Zerks> file not found
[12:07:57] <slaeke> capital E crap

[12:08:40] <slaeke> jsfiddle.net/9XXyX
[12:09:23] <slaeke> so, the problem is that chromes dev tools are showing me that the css('left') value of my dest2 <li> is 50px
[12:09:27] <larsemil> why do i get this? jquery is loaded and working on other stuff. object in this case is a clicked image... Object #<HTMLImageElement> has no method addClass
[12:09:58] <ajpiano> larsemil: because HTML elements don't have jQuery methods, jQuery objects do
[12:10:07] <ajpiano> $(this).addClass("watever")
[12:10:07] <slaeke> but when I console.log() the css('left') its giving me 80px as an answer...
[12:10:25] <larsemil> ajpiano: of course! thanks!
[12:10:29] <slaeke> and i've tried both .css('left') and .position().left
[12:10:38] <slaeke> and firefox is doing the same thing...
[12:10:57] <slaeke> showing left:50px in the dev tools, but giving me 80px as a response to .position().left
[12:13:15] <slaeke> ever seen that before?
[12:14:39] <seb_> How would I turn this into a ternary if http://pastebin.com/HfqreTjG
[12:15:23] <Zerks> return !regex.test(section) ? 0 : 1;
[12:15:42] <larsemil> how do i move an image to be first in container?
[12:16:23] <slaeke> @aro any ideas?
[12:16:33] <Zerks> seb_: if it doesn't have to be exactly 0/1 and can be false/true, you can just do return regex.test(section);
[12:17:08] <seb_> @zerks oh ok let my try
[12:17:46] <slaeke> heya zerks
[12:17:53] <slaeke> care to help me out with my question?
[12:18:31] <slaeke> have an imgur album
[12:18:42] <slaeke> and a jsfiddle setup
[12:18:49] <slaeke> jsfiddle.net/9XXyX
[12:18:58] <slaeke> imgur.com/a/8TXEu
[12:21:17] <seb_> how can I have my form be validated on submit and on change of form fields?
[12:23:42] <Eviltwin> slaeke: You don't have any HTML here
[12:24:00] <Eviltwin> slaeke: The point of jsFiddle is to build an "working" example that highlights your problem
[12:24:11] <Eviltwin> Your specific problem
[12:24:19] <slaeke> well its not the html thats the problem
[12:24:34] <slaeke> its a jquery call giving me the wrong result
[12:24:45] <slaeke> my html is pretty pure semantic...so there's no styles or anything
[12:24:55] <slaeke> but if you want to see it, i'll throw it in
[12:25:09] <Eviltwin> The problem is you've given an enormous block of code
[12:25:14] <Eviltwin> With nothing to make it fire
[12:25:22] <Eviltwin> So you're using jsFiddle as a glorified pastebin
[12:25:23] <slaeke> k hold on, i'll add the htm
[12:25:33] <Eviltwin> Whereas the point is to be able to actually test things
[12:25:34] <slaeke> honestly, thats all i really needed
[12:25:42] <slaeke> i'm only really concerned with one jquery line
[12:25:51] <slaeke> and i've provided screenshots of what is happening
[12:25:56] <Eviltwin> Then why didn't you just paste that one line?
[12:26:06] <slaeke> because I was asked to a jsfiddle...
[12:26:07] <slaeke> heh
[12:26:11] <slaeke> basically
[12:26:21] <slaeke> in the jsfiddle
[12:26:43] <slaeke> its the little block starting with var prev_r
[12:27:02] <slaeke> down to to the $(this).animate
[12:27:22] <slaeke> for some reason, chrome and firefox give me the wrong value for $(this).css('left')
[12:27:45] <Eviltwin> Look at .offset and .position
[12:27:48] <slaeke> but when I check the dev tools, the inline style (set by jquery) says "left:50px"
[12:27:57] <slaeke> i've used .position
[12:28:03] <slaeke> the calc was still off by 30px
[12:28:15] <slaeke> but it worries me even more
[12:28:18] <seb_> I have a html form which I validate using jquery, each form has its own function for validation, how can I have it so if they all validate the submit button becomes enabled?
[12:28:23] <slaeke> that the css property is off
[12:28:31] <larsemil> how do i do if i have X pictures and want the width and height to be so big that they all fit on page without scrolling?
[12:28:36] <slaeke> since that should be pulling directly from the inline style where I can clearly see its wrong
[12:29:05] <Eviltwin> First off $(this).prev()[0].style.left is going to be a string
[12:29:24] <slaeke> yeh that was just something I tried after pulling my hair out
[12:29:31] <slaeke> i originally had .position().left
[12:29:40] <slaeke> and it was still wrong by 30px
[12:29:54] <slaeke> gave me 80px when the dev tolls show left:50px
[12:30:01] <slaeke> *tools
[12:30:06] <Eviltwin> Now the reason for making a proper jsFiddle is it would allow me to try things here
[12:30:10] <Eviltwin> And help you solve your problem
[12:30:15] <slaeke> ok i'll throw the html in
[12:30:54] <slaeke> jsfiddle.net/9XXyX/1
[12:31:46] <Eviltwin> I think you're missing the point of the jsFiddle
[12:31:53] <Eviltwin> It's not to put your whole freaking webpage in it
[12:31:59] <Eviltwin> It's to isolate your problem
[12:32:02] <Eviltwin> And demonstrate it
[12:32:50] <Eviltwin> So try to boil your problem down
[12:33:06] <slaeke> ok how much html you want? just the <ul> causing the problem?
[12:34:12] <slaeke> ok updated to just the <ul> causing the problem
[12:34:34] <slaeke> jsfiddle.net/9XXyX/2
[12:34:54] <Eviltwin> You still have 9 JavaScript includes, none of which actually exist there
[12:35:52] <Eviltwin> Not to mention all of these li's are empty and are thus unclickable
[12:36:28] <slaeke> i dont jsfiddle is going to work for me then
[12:36:34] <slaeke> I can't share the whole page
[12:36:40] <cbobo> how can I bind a function to happen after the form has finished uploading?  I tried $("#myform").ajaxStop(function() { }); but it does not get called when #myform has finished
[12:36:40] <slaeke> since its for work and confidential
[12:36:46] <Eviltwin> You're not supposed to share the whole page
[12:36:47] <slaeke> so i can't put it up live
[12:36:51] <slaeke> and
[12:36:52] <Eviltwin> You're supposed to isolate your problem
[12:36:59] <slaeke> i cant share the images that im using
[12:37:03] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't haev two pages of HTML and JavaScript
[12:37:10] <slaeke> so it would be a lot of effort to set up the jsfiddle so that you can see the problem
[12:37:13] <Eviltwin> You should have the snippet that's releveant
[12:37:25] <Eviltwin> Just the little tiniest pieces you need to demonstrate the problem
[12:37:58] <dross> ajpiano: :-)
[12:38:22] <slaeke> problem is, I need a lot to demonstrate the problem
[12:38:52] <slaeke> the problem happens on a click of the LIs, but before that, their positions are changed
[12:38:54] <Eviltwin> slaeke: Here's what you need to do
[12:39:07] <Eviltwin> You need to start removing pieces until the problem no longer presents itself
[12:39:17] <Eviltwin> Then isolate just that piece that was causing the problem
[12:40:13] <slaeke> how about this...have you ever heard of Chrome and firefox giving a response to .css('left') that contradicts the value shown as inline style in the dev tools? cuz that is what is happening...
[12:40:28] <slaeke> also happens with position().left
[12:41:06] <seb_> How can I loop through to see if any of my X functions return false
[12:41:57] <totimkopf> hi guys :) I'm getting an error using a wordpress plugin 'jQuery.toJSON is not a function' how do I go about making sure that there is no conflict with other jquery plugins loaded?
[12:42:25] <totimkopf> I tried doing something like jQuery.noConflict(); but that didn't help
[12:44:23] <Eviltwin> slaeke: Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/YY2KG/
[12:45:24] <slaeke> pretty much...the result I get is 30px more than the inline style value
[12:46:04] <Eviltwin> seb_: var anyfalse=false; $.each(o,function(){if(this() === false) { anyfalse = true; return false; } });
[12:46:42] <Eviltwin> Are they absolutely positioned?
[12:46:48] <slaeke> yes
[12:46:54] <YammYgirlcoding> hi. I have a div id=xpto.  Can i move it to somewhere else using jquery?
[12:46:54] <slaeke> with no padding or margin
[12:47:06] <YammYgirlcoding> after page renders
[12:47:20] <YammYgirlcoding> i mean the entire div
[12:47:25] <Eviltwin> slaeke: http://jsfiddle.net/YY2KG/1/
[12:47:56] <Eviltwin> slaeke: Notice that position shows a left of 50
[12:48:23] <Eviltwin> offset shows a left of 55 because it includes the margin
[12:48:39] <slaeke> ya, i used position() at first, and it was also wrong
[12:48:48] <slaeke> i dont wanna use offset
[12:49:10] <seb_> Eviltwin: how can I make it so that it only check a specified set fo functions?
[12:49:18] <slaeke> because the ul will eventually be margin 0 auto, so the position will be off.
[12:49:25] <Eviltwin> seb_: Any of the functions in the list o
[12:49:42] <Eviltwin> slaeke: You said they were absolutely positioned
[12:49:49] <slaeke> in my screenshots though, you can see that the left value inline is clearly 50, but the .css left is giving me 80
[12:50:04] <slaeke> inside a position: relative container
[12:50:05] <slaeke> ya
[12:50:27] <slaeke> and neither the container nor the <li>s have margin or padding
[12:50:45] <Eviltwin> Okay, so I want you to make a fiddle or fork this one
[12:50:59] <Eviltwin> Add that margin 0 auto css
[12:51:07] <Eviltwin> Change them to ULs or whatever
[12:51:13] <Eviltwin> But keep it small, like my example
[12:51:25] <Eviltwin> Not a lot going on, keep it focused
[12:51:57] <slaeke> i would love to....dont have time now...
[12:52:09] <slaeke> thought that my screenshots and original stuff would be good enough to go on
[12:52:10] <Eviltwin> Okay, well neither do we
[12:52:16] <slaeke> but i have to run in a few
[12:52:35] <Eviltwin> Well that also didn't include any of your CSS
[12:52:43] <Eviltwin> And this is definitely a CSS-related problem
[12:52:55] <slaeke> true, but the jquery sets the css
[12:53:06] <Eviltwin> Not your style.css that your HTML shows?
[12:53:07] <slaeke> and the screenshot was taken after the css is set by jquery
[12:53:12] <slaeke> so that result is shown in the screen
[12:53:25] <slaeke> the result of jquery setting the css is left:50
[12:53:29] <slaeke> thats shown in dev tools
[12:53:40] <slaeke> then i console.log the value, and i get back 80..
[12:53:43] <slaeke> i dont think its a css issue..
[12:53:53] <slaeke> more like a jquery issue or chrome/firefox bug...
[12:54:05] <slaeke> because even the display of the page shows that the item is actually being positioned left;50
[12:54:42] <slaeke> so, the rendering engine puts it 50px left, the inline style shown in dev tools says 50 left, the only thing that is different is the jquery .position().left value.
[12:54:43] <Eviltwin> .css isn't designed to be one-to-one with .style
[12:54:56] <Eviltwin> jQuery's .css vs the DOM's .style for elements
[12:54:58] <JasonBeee> How would I output specific HTML here? http://pastebin.com/k7bqPVt2
[12:55:10] <slaeke> sure, but position().left would be, right?
[12:55:16] <Eviltwin> Nope
[12:55:21] <JasonBeee> A block of HTML rather
[12:55:23] <slaeke> hmm why not?
[12:56:03] <Eviltwin> They're all designed to give you information about where the element is actually drawn relative to its parent
[12:56:13] <Eviltwin> Or in offset from the page
[12:56:45] <slaeke> sure, so if the inline style says 50, and there's nothing else to contradict that and the object is actually drawn left 50, why would position().left not give me 50?
[12:57:01] <Eviltwin> Because of paddings, margins, and borders
[12:57:05] <slaeke> none, i checked
[12:57:09] <slaeke> on anything
[12:57:21] <slaeke> the onyl thing that had a padding was the <body>, padding 8px
[12:57:27] <slaeke> (i know, should be using a resest)
[12:57:30] <slaeke> *reset
[12:57:41] <Eviltwin> Why aren't you?
[12:57:46] <slaeke> still doesn't account for 30px diference, and the <body> isn't the parent
[12:57:59] <slaeke> its not my page, just helping some other people out
[12:58:02] <slaeke> might suggest that though
[13:02:09] <Eviltwin> slaeke: UL's are loaded with all sorts of browser-specific CSS
[13:02:18] <Eviltwin> Including special padding and margins
[13:03:05] <slaeke> ya, i checked dev tools for those too, actually, we are using a reset, its just embedded into the css, not another file liek I'd have done it...heh
[13:03:38] <slaeke> the <li>s and the <ul> have no extra padding or margin from anywhere that I can see with dev tools
[13:03:44] <slaeke> hence why i'm soo confused...
[13:04:11] <slaeke> i'm tempted to remove the <ul> and just make them divs
[13:04:13] <slaeke> just to be sure
[13:06:37] <totimkopf> I tried jQuery.noConflict(); but I'm still getting jQuery.toJSON is not a function, any ideas?
[13:07:02] <Eviltwin> totimkopf: Probably because there is no such function
[13:07:29] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: but I see it declared
[13:07:36] <Eviltwin> Where?
[13:07:41] <Marak> SlexAxton: http://soundcloud.com/marak/the-stack-trace-boyz-sexy
[13:07:50] <Marak> where is adam s
[13:07:51] <Marak> lol
[13:08:00] <totimkopf> (function($){$.toJSON=function(o) ... etc it's in a separate file
[13:08:02] <Marak> SlexAxton: we looking for new members, only jquery pros
[13:08:40] <Eviltwin> Is that separate file included after jQuery is included?
[13:09:05] <JasonBeee> Anyone? How would I input a block of HTML here? http://pastebin.com/k7bqPVt2
[13:09:15] <Eviltwin> JasonBeee: Um...what?
[13:09:37] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: if it weren't, wouldn't I be getting a different error like 'jQuery.toJSON' not defined?
[13:09:57] <Eviltwin> What are you getting instead?
[13:10:10] <JasonBeee> Or output php that echos a block of html i guess?
[13:10:23] <totimkopf> I'm getting 'is not a function'
[13:10:29] <Eviltwin> totimkopf: From what?
[13:10:38] <totimkopf> JQuery.toJSON is not a function
[13:10:41] <totimkopf> xD
[13:10:46] <Eviltwin> From what?
[13:11:17] <totimkopf> I don't understand the question, what do you mean?
[13:11:29] <Eviltwin> How do you know jQuery.toJSON is not a function?
[13:12:11] <totimkopf> well, obviously, if it's declared as such I know it's supposed to be a function but an error tells me otherwise
[13:12:25] <Eviltwin> What's giving you the error?
[13:12:43] <totimkopf> an event is giving me the error
[13:13:02] <totimkopf> of course, that's because that's when that function is invoked
[13:13:05] <Eviltwin> You should be seeing a message more like "'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'jQuery.toJSON("Hello")')"
[13:13:27] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: no, I'm not, I'm getting is not a function
[13:13:39] <Eviltwin> totimkopf: So what is it?
[13:13:46] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: and this is the kicker, this code works locally but with another environment it seems to get screwed up
[13:13:50] <Eviltwin> Are you using Firebug or the debug tools?
[13:14:00] <totimkopf> I'm using Firebug's Console
[13:14:06] <Eviltwin> Okay, type jQuery.toJSON
[13:14:31] <Eviltwin> What do you get?
[13:14:56] <totimkopf> jQuery.toJSON is not a function : arrayData = jQuery.toJSON(arrayData);
[13:15:05] <Eviltwin> ............
[13:15:20] <Eviltwin> Type jQuery.toJSON in the console and press enter
[13:15:27] <Eviltwin> Just that
[13:15:28] <starsinmypockets> Is there a jquery function to add a value to a form field?
[13:15:28] <Eviltwin> Nothing else
[13:15:48] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: Add a value? Do you mean set the value?
[13:16:13] <totimkopf> it says undefined
[13:16:36] <Eviltwin> Are you sure that code that sets $.toJSON is getting run?
[13:16:37] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin: correct
[13:16:39] <Eviltwin> Can you set a breakpoint
[13:16:44] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: .val("new value")
[13:16:54] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin cheers ;)
[13:17:38] <YammYgirlcoding> guys is that right?    $('#newplace').append( $('#oldplace') );
[13:17:54] <YammYgirlcoding> i want to move the div#oldplace to inside the div#newplace
[13:18:02] <Eviltwin> Yup
[13:20:03] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: the 'separate js file' is indeed included in the header
[13:20:22] <totimkopf> let me paste bin the file somewhere
[13:20:34] <YammYgirlcoding> ah it worked! the first div had a class not an id =^^=
[13:20:44] <Eviltwin> totimkopf: But is it getting run?
[13:20:56] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: doesn't look like it :S
[13:21:04] <totimkopf> and I have no idea why it wouldn't be
[13:21:18] <Eviltwin> Have you pasted that file somewhere?
[13:22:04] <totimkopf> http://pastebin.com/fsu8LDH1
[13:22:55] <mvk> i got a div with the id "blkoutput", im trying to animate its backgroundcolor after a ajax call returns.. $('#blkoutput').animate({ backgroundColor: "#FFCBB5" }, 500);
[13:23:11] <mvk> from fffff to the given color, unfortunately, its not working, what am i doing wrong?
[13:24:21] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: I put an alert at the beginning of that file and it was invoked
[13:24:46] <Eviltwin> mvk: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[13:25:10] <Eviltwin> totimkopf: Throw a window.console.log(jQuery) at the top instead
[13:25:18] <mvk> Eviltwin: well, its a build-in feature
[13:25:27] <mvk> why should i use a plugin for that
[13:25:33] <Eviltwin> mvk: I don't believe color fading is a built-in feature
[13:25:40] <mvk> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/ColorAnimations
[13:25:47] <mvk> Eviltwin: check the url, it is
[13:27:17] <Eviltwin> "All animated properties should be animated to a single numeric value, except as noted below; most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality. (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be.) "
[13:27:31] <Eviltwin> jQuery UI might include the color extension
[13:28:19] <SlexAxton> Marak: i have been super busy , and am about to get married and go on a honeymoon. BUT i still want to battle (and join) in like 3 weeks. deal?
[13:28:37] <Marak> SlexAxton: i only understand actions and not promises
[13:28:41] <mvk> Eviltwin: ahhh ok, i see -> effects.core.js is a seperate JS
[13:28:43] <Marak> SlexAxton: so let me know
[13:28:49] <SlexAxton> Marak: deal
[13:28:50] <mvk> Eviltwin: thank you very much.
[13:28:54] <gizmore> Good evening. I wrote a jquery plugin, but i have a problem assigning the same plugin to multiple elements. i think i tracked the problem down to:   setTimeout(function(){ $(this).show(); _render(this); }, data['delay']); ..... how can add the $this parameter to the timeout?
[13:28:57] <Marak> SlexAxton: did you listen to http://soundcloud.com/marak/the-stack-trace-boyz-sexy yet?
[13:29:04] <Marak> :p
[13:29:16] <SlexAxton> at a conf
[13:29:21] <SlexAxton> let me track down some headphones
[13:29:23] <Marak> bump it there
[13:29:28] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: with window.console.log(jQuery) it just returns a link to function() and doesn't say much
[13:29:31] <Marak> totally relevant
[13:29:38] <SlexAxton> DURING KYLE SIMPSONS TALK?!
[13:29:43] <Marak> hell yeah
[13:29:49] <Marak> its called sexy script
[13:29:52] <SlexAxton> on it
[13:29:53] <Marak> kyle likes sexy script
[13:30:10] <Eviltwin> gizmore: All the parameters after the delay get passed as arguments to the setTimeout function
[13:30:27] <gizmore> Eviltwin: thank you very very much
[13:30:31] <Eviltwin> setTimeout(function(a) { alert(a) }, 100, "Hello, World!")
[13:31:54] <gizmore> hmm still same problem ... may i show you my plugin?
[13:32:27] <mvk> im using ui effects, why isnt this working: $('#blkoutput').animate({ backgroundColor: "#FFCBB5" }, 1500).delay(3000);   ???
[13:32:34] <mvk> oh it is, sorry for asking
[13:32:35] <mvk> :D
[13:33:04] <Eviltwin> gizmore: Please paste a link to it
[13:33:06] <gizmore> Eviltwin: http://trac.gwf3.gizmore.org/browser/www/js/jq/ghostwriter.js  ... when assigned to multiple elements it takes always the same text to render :)
[13:33:25] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: the only thing I can say is that if this code works locally with the same version of wordpress as what's on the production, the difference between the production server and the local server is that the production server has a bunch of other jQuery plugins conflicting with this one, couldn't this be the case?
[13:33:32] <Eviltwin> gizmore: Which line?
[13:33:48] <gizmore> Eviltwin: line 47 is the timeout call
[13:34:53] <Eviltwin> You're sure it's the same $this every time?
[13:35:14] <Eviltwin> totimkopf: Try adding a ; at the beginning of the file
[13:35:26] <gizmore> Eviltwin: it replaces all of the elements with the same .html()
[13:35:56] <gizmore> But it should take the different texts ... :/ not always the same
[13:37:19] <Eviltwin> I would take a look at jQuery UI widgets
[13:37:50] <Eviltwin> And use that to build your plugin
[13:37:50] <gizmore> when i add alert($this.html()) to line 47, it shows the correct text
[13:38:37] <felipevieira> where can I find good free jquery pop-up plugins?
[13:39:39] <Eviltwin> gizmore: Do you have .ghostwriter calls for multiple collecitons?
[13:39:43] <Eviltwin> collections*
[13:40:12] <gizmore> i call it like $('#content p').ghostwriter()
[13:41:22] <Eviltwin> As you've written it right now, there's only one set of "methods" and all instances share it
[13:41:56] <gizmore> i see ... how to have multiple sets of methods?
[13:42:09] <gizmore> with this.method = function()?
[13:42:48] <Eviltwin> I would recommend looking at jQuery UI Widget
[13:43:05] <gizmore> hehe ok :) ... ill just use a different selector for now :)
[13:43:11] <gizmore> thank you for your time and help!
[13:44:05] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be seeing :)
[13:45:44] <Eviltwin> totimkopf: Can you substitute this instead: http://pastebin.com/6m3sAVxM
[13:45:48] <Eviltwin> And put some breakpoints inside
[13:45:57] <Eviltwin> See what parts are actually getting run
[13:46:52] <Cameron> if you go here: http://vermilionsite.com/phone/ select iphone 4s, then click $300 and then click next
[13:46:58] <Cameron> why doesnt it do anything?
[13:47:22] <Cameron> the console says
[13:47:22] <Cameron> Uncaught TypeError: string is not a function
[13:53:02] <Eviltwin> Cameron: You know using onclick is very 90's JavaScript, right?
[13:53:14] <Cameron> ohhh
[13:53:19] <Cameron> whats better?
[13:53:44] <Eviltwin> You create or select the elements and bind listeners
[13:53:52] <Cameron> hmm ok
[13:53:56] <Eviltwin> With jQuery $("...").click(function(){...});
[13:54:03] <Cameron> ok
[13:54:20] <Cameron> well whats wrong with it anyway?
[13:54:25] <Cameron> i'll change it to that later
[13:54:50] <Eviltwin> Not quite sure why it's not working
[13:54:54] <Eviltwin> Probably something with variable scope
[13:55:08] <Cameron> meaning what?
[13:56:04] <davexoxide> $('.element').click(); // this works
[13:56:19] <falieson> $("#various4").fancybox({ . how do I change #various4 from an id reference to a class reference?
[13:56:33] <MayorofDetroit> Yo yo yo what up MAH HOMIEZ
[13:56:33] <davexoxide> $('.element').click(function() { alert("TEST"); }); // does not work
[13:56:38] <davexoxide> any idea why?
[13:56:43] <MayorofDetroit> MAYOR OF DETROIT be in da house.
[13:57:05] * MayorofDetroit is building a jquery plugin.
[13:57:47] <Eviltwin> davexoxide: Elements with class "element"?
[13:57:50] <MayorofDetroit> What are some common worst-practices of first-time jquery plugin code-rangers?
[13:58:29] <Eviltwin> MayorofDetroit: What kind of plugin?
[13:58:58] <davexoxide> Eviltwin: that was just an example. the class is actually "div[data-fullname=" + data + "] .hide-button span a";
[13:59:27] <Eviltwin> How are you setting/changing data-fullname?
[14:00:00] <MayorofDetroit> Eviltwin: The kind of plugin that turns a boring <marquee> element into a ****FREAKING FREAKING SICK**** drop-anything-from-anywhere-AND-UPLOAD-TO-UR-SITE plugin.
[14:00:07] <Deadpool21619> any expected date on the ui1.9rc
[14:00:33] <davexoxide> Eviltwin: here's what I have so far.
[14:00:34] <davexoxide> http://pastebin.com/uAg3bgPx
[14:00:41] <MayorofDetroit> Eviltwin: I've already coded the File API/drag events. I'm just working it into the best jquery plugin possible.
[14:01:05] <davexoxide> Eviltwin: it's for a chrome extension for Reddit to automatically click the hide link as I scroll down the page.
[14:02:21] <falieson> $("#various4").fancybox({ . how do I change #various4 from an id reference to a class reference?
[14:02:27] <davexoxide> Eviltwin: and please forgive my .parent().parent().parent() call… I was getting lazy trying to find the correct prev div that I needed.
[14:03:05] <MayorofDetroit> When web developers use my plugin on their site, they'll need an interstitial to tell the the users to DIAL 911 BECAUSE IT'S SO SICK YOU'RE GONNA NEED AN AMBULANCE
[14:03:22] <Eviltwin> davexoxide: Is this a Reddit thread
[14:03:23] <Eviltwin> ?
[14:03:25] <Eviltwin> Comment thread
[14:03:46] <davexoxide> Eviltwin: like slashdot or digg… but more comical
[14:03:49] <MayorofDetroit> davexoxide: What about nearest()?
[14:04:01] <davexoxide> and not as ronchy as 4chan
[14:04:04] <MayorofDetroit> err, closest()
[14:04:11] <MayorofDetroit> *raunchy
[14:04:12] <davexoxide> MayorofDetroit: I will try that!
[14:04:25] <davexoxide> MayorofDetroit: is also a grammar nazi
[14:04:56] <MayorofDetroit> davexoxide: I am actually the Mayor of Detroit.
[14:05:38] <juha_> falieson: ehh, change # to . ? :D
[14:05:41] * MayorofDetroit loves his job because he gets to listen to Madonna records while writing code for Detroit.
[14:05:52] <falieson> juha_: tried it and it didn't work, should it have?
[14:06:00] <falieson> because then it means there is a problem somewhere else
[14:06:29] <davexoxide> if I was mayor of Detroit I wouldn't be the one writing code. people need jobs in that city. I'd hire a freelancer.
[14:06:40] <Deadpool21619> Firebug to the rescue
[14:06:47] <MayorofDetroit> davexoxide: We are coding jobs.
[14:07:29] * MayorofDetroit wants to kick Michigan's Secretary of State out of Cadillac Place.
[14:08:00] <MayorofDetroit> Also, the Michigan Lottery are a tax on Detroit.
[14:09:12] * MayorofDetroit heads back to writing code for the Detroit Bit Factory.
[14:09:35] <falieson> $("#various4").fancybox({ . how do I change #various4 from an id reference to a class reference? should .various4 do it?
[14:10:12] <ravenzz> yes
[14:10:30] <juha_> falieson: how do you style the element in css?
[14:10:39] <juha_> falieson: use the same selector for jquery
[14:10:47] <MayorofDetroit> I wrote my own plugins framework, and now I see the point of jquery. So I need to convert all my DHTML plugins from my custom framework to jquery. Any suggestions? :/
[14:11:02] <juha_> MayorofDetroit: start cracking!
[14:11:15] <MayorofDetroit> lol
[14:11:29] <falieson> juha_:  <a href="popout.html#resume_arvixe.html" class="boxout">
[14:12:12] <falieson> so changing $("#various4").fancybox({  to $(".boxout").fancybox({  should do it right?
[14:12:13] <juha_> falieson: that's html, not css :P
[14:12:28] <juha_> falieson: if the class is boxout, then yes
[14:12:45] <falieson> well thanks, at least i know that's not hte problem then
[14:12:48] <falieson> :-)
[14:13:04] <falieson> because I can't get the boxout to work
[14:13:11] <juha_> have you checked console for errors?
[14:13:28] <ravenzz> of course not (!?)
[14:14:05] <falieson> i'm in netbeans, doesn't say there are any errors
[14:14:21] <starsinmypockets> Possible to apply sustring method to a jquery object. eg $('#foo').substring(0,5); ?
[14:14:22] <Eviltwin> Christ, netbeans?
[14:14:26] <juha_> falieson: debug with browser
[14:14:34] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: Uh...substring?
[14:14:41] <juha_> falieson: your users aren't going to use your site with netbeanss
[14:15:02] <ravenzz> starsinmypockets subUstring
[14:15:07] <ravenzz> starsinmypockets substring
[14:15:12] <falieson> juha, hahah yeah - hopefully not many people see this site anyway
[14:15:13] <falieson> lol
[14:15:36] <Eviltwin> ?.slice @ starsinmypockets
[14:15:36] <bot-t> starsinmypockets, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[14:15:39] <juha_> falieson: eithere you have error somewhere or wrong selector
[14:18:07] <starsinmypockets> EvilTwin - not trying to redHmm.. I'm trying to select an element, and rewrite its class, then the rewritten string to an ajax callback,,,
[14:18:29] <Eviltwin> You can only take a substring of a string
[14:19:07] <gooddesignusa> anyone use the jcrop plugin?
[14:19:47] <starsinmypockets> Then I wonder how to return the class of an element as a string...
[14:20:49] <Eviltwin> Get the element out and use .className
[14:21:03] <Eviltwin> Or .attr('class')
[14:25:18] <slaeke_> hey all, back again :) this time with a functioning jsfiddle...lol
[14:25:33] <slaeke_> eviltwin, you stilla round?
[14:25:44] <slaeke_> http://jsfiddle.net/gueX2/
[14:26:39] <davexoxide> MayorofDetroit: closest() worked nicely.
[14:29:50] <slaeke_> basically, i'm trying to get the .position().left value for an element, and chrome (and firefox) is giving me back a value that is completely wrong.
[14:30:29] <Eviltwin> Not for me
[14:30:36] <MayorofDetroit> davexoxide: ;>
[14:30:45] <slaeke_> orly?
[14:31:01] <MayorofDetroit> What am I doing wrong? if (!$(this).hasClass('applet.gallerymanager')) { throw "Cannot initialize: Class is not applet.gallerymanager."; }
[14:31:09] <MayorofDetroit> *incorrectly
[14:31:29] <slaeke_> dont need the tag name in the class atribute
[14:31:36] <slaeke_> if the class is gallerymanager
[14:31:51] <slaeke_> should just be .hasClass('gallerymanager')
[14:31:52] <MayorofDetroit> applet is also a class
[14:32:12] <MayorofDetroit> How do I test for two classes without calling hasClass() twice?
[14:32:12] <slaeke_> should be .applet .gallerymanager
[14:32:25] <MayorofDetroit> ah
[14:32:28] <slaeke_> i bet you can comma delimit the list
[14:32:33] <slaeke_> or just call it twice
[14:32:39] <slaeke_> .hasCLass().hasClass()
[14:33:22] <ravenzz> .hasClass('foo bar')
[14:33:31] <slaeke_> ya that too
[14:33:47] <Eviltwin> .is('.foo, .bar') for either, .is('.foo.bar') for both
[14:33:54] <MayorofDetroit> ravenzz: Brilliant
[14:33:56] <MayorofDetroit> Thanks
[14:34:01] <MayorofDetroit> Thanks everyone :)
[14:34:09] <ravenzz> it works as an AND
[14:34:14] * MayorofDetroit gets back to working on DetroitBitFactory.js
[14:34:17] <ravenzz> if you need an OR
[14:34:18] <slaeke_> @Eviltwin:  this jsfiddle actualyl works...heh
[14:34:19] <slaeke_> http://jsfiddle.net/gueX2/
[14:34:32] <Eviltwin> Probably CSS reset-related
[14:34:37] <ravenzz> that's not working anymore
[14:34:39] <Eviltwin> Fiddles have a CSS reset
[14:34:48] <ravenzz> yep
[14:34:50] <slaeke_> ya
[14:34:54] <slaeke_> so i dont need mine?
[14:35:11] <Eviltwin> You aren't including a CSS reset, you're including CSS
[14:35:13] <slaeke_> in the fiddle?
[14:35:25] <Eviltwin> This is what a CSS reset looks like: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
[14:35:32] <slaeke_> i removed it for the fiddle
[14:35:42] <slaeke_> will paste it back
[14:36:28] <Eviltwin> This is what jsFiddle uses: http://jsfiddle.net/css/normalize.css
[14:36:51] <slaeke_> i pasted back in the meyer reset CSS, but it didnt change anything
[14:37:02] <slaeke_> http://jsfiddle.net/gueX2/2/
[14:37:21] <Eviltwin> So it's working in the Fiddle?
[14:37:23] <Eviltwin> As it should
[14:37:41] <slaeke_> nope
[14:37:46] <slaeke_> still showing me the wrong numbers
[14:37:50] <slaeke_> even with everything pulled out
[14:37:52] <slaeke_> but the lsit
[14:37:54] <slaeke_> *list
[14:38:06] <slaeke_> left still showing in the console as 80, and inline as 50
[14:38:24] <ravenzz> slaeke_ what are you trying to do with your script?
[14:39:13] <slaeke_> basically trying to calculate the right edge of the previous LI of the clicked one....so that I can position the clicked one 50px to its right...
[14:39:27] <slaeke_> and the inline style is showing me that the left is 50x
[14:39:55] <slaeke_> but my console.log( $(this).prev().position().left) is showing 80px
[14:40:07] <slaeke_> so the value is weirdly wrong...and I can't figure out why
[14:41:10] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: I have no idea why that function isn't getting defined :S
[14:42:11] <ravenzz> slaeke_ no i mean the whole script not just this position() snippet
[14:42:19] <ravenzz> / function
[14:42:29] <slaeke_> ok, the whole script is a little complicated
[14:42:41] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/gueX2/3/
[14:43:02] <slaeke_> basically, I'm trying to accent the clicked <li> by moving the others in the lsit out of the way, using absolute positioning, similar to an accordion
[14:43:41] <slaeke_> @Eviltwin: console shows 80 for me
[14:44:03] <Eviltwin> It should show a hell of a lot more than just 80
[14:44:35] <slaeke_> yeh, but when I clicked dest3, dest3's .left is 80
[14:44:38] <slaeke_> and thats wrong
[14:45:00] <Eviltwin> Don't you see "dest2 z-index: 7; left: 80px;  80"?
[14:45:15] <slaeke_> yes
[14:45:18] <slaeke_> i do se that
[14:45:28] <slaeke_> but i also see this when i inspect
[14:45:29] <slaeke_> <li id="dest2" style="z-index: 7; left: 50px; ">clickable 2</li>
[14:45:32] <Eviltwin> That's ID, CSS string, then .position().left
[14:45:39] <Eviltwin> Because that's what it is *AFTER*
[14:45:53] <Eviltwin> Elements live update in the inspector
[14:46:01] <slaeke_> hmmm
[14:46:19] <slaeke_> so, the console.log is happening *Before* the move?
[14:46:26] <Eviltwin> Uh...yeah
[14:46:29] <Eviltwin> How could it not?
[14:46:31] <MayorofDetroit> Is this the best way to check for an attribute being set: if (typeof $(this).attr('data-gallery') != 'undefined')
[14:46:33] <Eviltwin> This is all asyncronous
[14:46:57] <slaeke_> why isn't the console.log being executed inline?
[14:47:04] <Eviltwin> What?
[14:47:31] <oojacoboo> .live() or .delegate() ?
[14:47:36] <slaeke_> ok wait...
[14:47:40] <slaeke_> the console.log function
[14:47:47] <slaeke_> when is that getting executed?
[14:49:27] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: I copied that code into www.jslint.com and got heaps of errors, though
[14:49:58] <Eviltwin> totimkopf: Which code?
[14:50:18] <totimkopf> Eviltwin: the separate js file, the one from pastebin
[14:51:54] <slaeke_> @ravenzz any ideas
[14:52:00] <illourr> hello
[14:52:03] <slaeke_> ?
[14:52:25] <illourr> anyone experiment with changing styles with ajax?
[14:52:39] <slaeke_> which styles?
[14:52:47] <illourr> like the whole website
[14:52:53] <illourr> without refreshing the header
[14:53:05] <slaeke_> switch stylesheets?
[14:53:07] <slaeke_> with jquery/
[14:53:08] <slaeke_> ?
[14:53:13] <illourr> i found out a way
[14:53:16] <illourr> without switching sheets
[14:53:34] <illourr> using ajax
[14:53:38] <ravenzz> oh Shee
[14:53:46] <ravenzz> slaeke_ maybe offset() ?
[14:54:07] <slaeke_> would rather not use offset
[14:54:14] <slaeke_> the addition would be much more complicated
[14:54:17] <illourr> made a function with $('body').append(<style></style>)
[14:54:36] <illourr> then used onclick with the function..
[14:54:43] <ravenzz> yep wait, so if i understood you are trying to make an horizontal accordion?
[14:55:59] <slaeke_> yep
[14:56:01] <slaeke_> basically
[14:57:27] <illourr> someone told me that was illegal in relation to w3 standards, does it really matter?
[14:57:30] <zmbmartin> Anyone that can help me come up with how to get the cpu usage down on this --> https://gist.github.com/1272938 Specifically the total_green_point function. That seems to be what runs up the cpu because I am calling after every field change and there are around 400 to 450 fields.
[14:58:32] <zmbmartin> all the other stuff appears to not be a problem but if I fill in fields at a steady pace that total_green_point function runs up the cpu pretty well.
[14:58:47] <zmbmartin> Any thought on how I should go about that instead?
[14:59:24] <MayorofDetroit> Iif (typeof $(this).attr('data-gallery') != 'undefined')  -- Is there a way to be more succinct?
[15:00:37] <oojacoboo> how can I add live or delegate to… 			$pageContainer.find(".expand-title").click(function(event){
[15:00:39] <slaeke_> @ravenzz bbl going to see a movie with my lady...will you be around later? I'm really stuck on this...heh
[15:07:55] <SudoKing> hi, i'm using jquery 1.6.4; i've set up a $.post() but for some reason instead of POSTing it's tacking a GET type string on to the end of the url?
[15:14:21] <aro> can you pass scopes with jquery?
[15:14:45] <Eviltwin> aro: Pass scopes?
[15:14:56] <Eviltwin> What kind of scopes?
[15:15:03] <aro> i am trying to put my thoughts into words
[15:15:17] <dabear> my guess is that you wanna see ?bind , aro
[15:15:17] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[15:15:33] <dabear> hm
[15:15:35] <dabear> not that bind
[15:15:41] <Eviltwin> ?proxy @ aro
[15:15:41] <bot-t> aro, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[15:15:45] <dabear> yep
[15:15:49] <dabear> or ?mdc bind
[15:15:59] <Eviltwin> But that's not fully supported yet
[15:16:08] <aro> ok
[15:16:32] <Eviltwin> So what are you trying to do anyway?
[15:17:13] <aro> i dont know how to put it in words :(
[15:17:24] <aro> i need a nap i think
[15:17:55] <aro> like pass (this) as a scope where it is a jquery table object
[15:18:04] <aro> and then have another function that can access $(this)
[15:18:06] <aro> and do stuff
[15:18:11] <SudoKing> http://jsfiddle.net/V5swH/ ; it adds "?notebook=test&submitNotebook=Save" to the URL when the form is submitted.. but by looking at the script, I don't think it should be.?
[15:18:12] <aro> so i can reorder the table and things like that
[15:18:24] <aro> SudoKing: are you submitting via GET?
[15:18:40] <aro> <form method="POST"
[15:18:50] <aro> and return false :)
[15:19:03] <Eviltwin> aro: $.proxy(function(){ /* this will be whaterver a is */ }, a);
[15:19:03] <SudoKing> i don't have a method supplied, nor an action=
[15:20:02] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: If you don't want that field to be sent, don't give it a name
[15:20:26] <SudoKing> i do want it to be sent, just not w/ GET
[15:21:17] <aro> ok
[15:21:39] <aro> here is my issue: a tr is clicked, i want to pass the parents('table') to another function
[15:21:41] <aro> how do i do that
[15:22:00] <Eviltwin> SudoKing: Nope, it's not sent with GET
[15:22:03] <Eviltwin> It's sent with POST
[15:22:16] <SudoKing> did you read what i said before..?
[15:23:03] <Eviltwin> How have you determined that it addde those to the URL?
[15:23:30] <SudoKing> by observing the address bar :)
[15:24:35] <SudoKing> i supplied method="POST", and it is posting now, but the field it sends is empty
[15:24:36] <ajpiano> aro: $("tr").click(function(e) {  anotherFunction( $(this).closest("table") );  });
[15:24:37] <Eviltwin> Okay, you see that jsFiddle you sent?
[15:25:00] <aro> thanks ajpiano
[15:25:23] <SudoKing> yea -- changed the method to POST now
[15:25:41] <SudoKing> aro: by return false, where do you mean? the submit function? or document.ready() ?
[15:25:46] <Eviltwin> The address bar is not changing
[15:26:10] <SudoKing> Eviltwin, when i submit the form on my website
[15:26:24] <Eviltwin> Then you did something wrong on your website
[15:26:30] <Eviltwin> But there's no problem with the code in the jsFiddle
[15:26:59] <SudoKing> well it's definitely client side as the field is being sent empty
[15:27:10] <SudoKing> the textarea, that is
[15:27:25] <SudoKing> (used Tamper Data to verify)
[15:27:44] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/V5swH/1/show/
[15:28:00] <Eviltwin> If you type something and press Save, the URL does not change
[15:28:09] <Eviltwin> And if you're tracking Network activity
[15:28:20] <Eviltwin> You see it's a POST
[15:28:27] <SudoKing> URL does not change anymore (after I changed it to method="POST" in the form)
[15:28:33] <SudoKing> the problem is that it sends the field empty
[15:28:54] <Eviltwin> Not in this Fiddle...
[15:29:17] <SudoKing> that fiddle has no where to submit to
[15:30:16] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/V5swH/2/show/
[15:30:20] <Eviltwin> Type something
[15:30:22] <Eviltwin> Press save
[15:30:25] <Eviltwin> Go to http://www.postbin.org/x362fd
[15:31:34] <Eviltwin> I'm not seeing a problem
[15:44:56] <starsinmypockets> Im pretty new to Ajax - is XMLHttpRequest object the preferred method for doing ajax calls (assuming we're sendig html data...)
[15:45:25] <dabear> starsinmypockets: yes, and see ?ajax
[15:45:25] <bot-t> starsinmypockets, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:45:26] <Eviltwin> Uh... it's *the* way
[15:45:30] <dabear> it does that for you
[15:45:47] <dabear> websockets, iframe posting etc are other alternatives
[15:46:20] <starsinmypockets> To load an image, for instance, I think I was using load()
[15:46:40] <dabear> .load is a wrapper for .ajax
[16:02:34] <THEtheChad> Does anyone know the built in method jQuery uses to convert colors to rgb values?
[16:02:54] <THEtheChad> Or is it a private method hidden in the library?
[16:06:13] <Eviltwin> THEtheChad: CSS actually accepts colors
[16:07:17] <THEtheChad> Eviltwin: Oh, I know =) I'm trying to write a custom jquery animation and I need to convert color data to rgb. I want to use a standard method versus writing my own conversion (if such a thing exists)
[16:08:18] <Eviltwin> From jquery.effects.core.js: http://pastebin.com/AFucWRkG
[16:08:39] <Eviltwin> It's not exposed publicly
[16:09:59] <THEtheChad> Eviltwin: I meant hex colors, sorry about the confusion =P
[16:10:20] <Eviltwin> So you convert these numbers to hex
[16:11:51] <THEtheChad> Basically, I was hoping there was a standard method that I could send any color ( hex, text, etc ) and it would spit out rgb. Jquery does it on everything so I assumed there was something already written inside the library
[16:12:49] <Eviltwin> Where does jQuery do it?
[16:13:21] <THEtheChad> Anytime you throw colors into $.css() they get converted to rgb
[16:14:26] <THEtheChad> So there's some sort of internal conversion happening
[16:15:05] <THEtheChad> And I'd like to plug in to that versus rolling my own hex->rgb / text-array -> rgb
[16:15:49] <THEtheChad> Eviltwin: I stand corrected, it only converts for hex
[16:18:29] <saddishwasher> hey all
[16:19:03] <Eviltwin> THEtheChad: I can't figure out how they're doing it
[16:19:11] <dabear> ?coloranimate
[16:19:14] <bot-t> dabear, UI/Effects/animate - The jQuery UI effects core extends the animate function to be able to animate colors as well. It's heavily used by the class transition feature and it's able to color animate the following properties: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/animate
[16:19:19] <Eviltwin> But somewhere between 1.3.2 and 1.4.4  it happened
[16:19:26] <dabear> ?color
[16:19:26] <bot-t> Color Animations - Adds the ability to do color animations to jQuery. Version 2 is currently in beta: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ jQuery 1.4+ required - Older versions http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[16:19:41] <Eviltwin> I just don't see where in the jQuery.js it's happening
[16:20:16] <dabear> THEtheChad: see ?color
[16:20:16] <bot-t> THEtheChad, Color Animations - Adds the ability to do color animations to jQuery. Version 2 is currently in beta: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ jQuery 1.4+ required - Older versions http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[16:20:40] <dabear> you can use that plugin to do convertions
[16:22:00] <dabear> toHexString etc
[16:28:35] <johnny> does firefox have any sort of implicit 60 second timeout when accessing a resource via xhr?
[16:29:40] <johnny> my long running script takes more than 60 seconds, and when accessing a page that sleeps for > 60 seconds via the browser directly it works, but not when accessed via jquery ajax (in this case jquery.form)
[16:33:44] <starsinmypockets> I'm doing an ajax callback to populate a form input... $("#input-id").val(function () {$(this).load('/path/to/foo')});  <---- what'm I doing wrong here?
[16:34:23] <Eviltwin> Many things
[16:34:49] <Eviltwin> $.get('/path/to/foo',function(data){$("#input-id').val(data)});
[16:34:54] <Zerks> $.get('/path/to/foo', function(data){function()
[16:34:55] <Zerks> ok
[16:35:00] <Zerks> typing the exact same thing as you
[16:35:03] <Zerks> so I gave up midway
[16:35:17] <Zerks> I don't know why it put an extra function() in there though, mess up
[16:35:26] <Zerks> was yelling at my irc client for turning ® into the R icon
[16:35:49] <Zerks> you are my eviltwin
[16:35:55] * Zerks goes back to own work
[16:37:37] <SudoKing> Eviltwin: *sigh* been working on it about an hour. so far, it works all the time in chromium. in firefox, only once every so often, but most of the time just tries to make a GET request to index.php
[16:50:35] <dckur> hello, how to make sure die working? I have a problem with live rendering binding click again and again

[18:18:13] <trufa> anybody can help me debug a failing json response?????
[18:19:13] <saddishwasher> ?ask @ trufa
[18:19:13] <bot-t> trufa, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:24:34] <trufa> this is the error
[18:24:34] <trufa> http://pastebin.com/AFzh01XE
[18:25:30] <saddishwasher> trufa, can you post the json string?
[18:25:53] <trufa> mmmm
[18:25:53] <trufa> this is a json request
[18:25:58] <trufa> and then I build the response
[18:26:08] <trufa> using java
[18:26:08] <trufa> that's where I get the error
[18:26:37] <trufa> makes sense?
[18:27:17] <saddishwasher> so is the error occurring during the request or the response building?
[18:28:49] <trufa> is it ok to put a boolean value in the response?
[18:28:55] <trufa> I am putting a java boolean
[18:29:01] <trufa> that's the last line in my code
[18:29:05] <trufa> then it blows
[18:29:30] <saddishwasher> trufa, do you mean javascript? or java? they are two different things
[18:29:39] <trufa> java
[18:29:48] <saddishwasher> you should probably search for a java room them
[18:29:51] <saddishwasher> then*
[18:29:53] <saddishwasher> #java
[18:30:06] <saddishwasher> I don't know anything about java
[18:30:12] <trufa> how do you debug these json errors?
[18:30:42] <kborchers> trufa: Neither of your questions has to do with jQuery
[18:30:48] <saddishwasher> thank you!
[18:31:09] <saddishwasher> I've been trying to figure out how they relate to jQuery and even javascript
[18:31:40] <saddishwasher> I'll ask again, is the error happening during the json request (hopefully via jquery) or during the build response?
[18:31:54] <kborchers> That's a java error
[18:37:30] <trufa> it's when I build the response
[18:37:40] <trufa> request is built with jquery
[18:37:44] <trufa> and it works fine
[18:37:51] <trufa> response has erro
[18:37:52] <trufa> r
[18:38:58] <JasonBeee> Is anyone familiar with setting up infinite scroll with jquery? I'm having some trouble defining my page's content, post and nav divs
[18:44:27] <Vaerros> everytime I use an infinite scroll interface, I feel like some announcer guy should shout "INFINIIIITE....SCROLL...*echoes*"
[18:47:19] <JasonBeee> But can you help me Vaerros  :)
[18:47:35] <Vaerros> nope
[19:06:45] <Spadeski> Anyone know how to get the color off the screen with jquery mousepoint ?
[19:31:40] <sontek> Hey, i'm trying to make a sortable grid of divs so I have <div id="box-container"><div class="sort">box 1</div><div class="sort">box2</div></div>  and then I did $("#box-container").sortable()   but that just makes one drop target, so I can't move box one over to the right of box 3 or anything like that
[19:33:24] <sontek> http://i.imgur.com/NblDR.png picture of whats going on
[20:13:17] <MayorofDetroit> $(event.target).closest('li').get(0) -- Is thisw dangerous?
[20:13:21] <bapi_> How can I change an "alt" value on a div?
[20:13:32] <MayorofDetroit> If there is nothing matching?
[20:13:42] <bapi_> Your computer will blow up :o
[20:14:02] <Coderah> bapi_: $("selector").attr("alt", "newValue");
[20:14:42] <MayorofDetroit> Do you know about get() Coderah :-/
[20:15:39] <Coderah> MayorofDetroit: .get is for ajax, im pretty sure you want to use eq(0) although i cannot see why, .closest() returns only one element
[20:16:17] <bapi_> thanks
[20:17:07] <kborchers> MayorofDetroit: It will return undefined I believe
[20:17:27] <MayorofDetroit> How is .get() for ajax if it returns a DOMElement?
[20:17:39] <Coderah> MayorofDetroit: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[20:17:44] <MayorofDetroit> kborchers: Is that safe as long as I check with typeof?
[20:17:53] <MayorofDetroit> Coderah: Why does it work then?
[20:17:54] <kborchers> Coderah: There is a difference between .get and $.get
[20:17:56] <Coderah> MayorofDetroit: all jquery functions return the last element so that you can chain things together
[20:18:07] <bapi_> whats the opposite word of collapse?
[20:18:07] <Coderah> kborchers: ah okay that would make sense
[20:18:18] <bapi_> such as "Collapse All" in a list
[20:18:23] <Coderah> bapi_: expand
[20:18:40] <bapi_> Is that proper grammar to use If I have a list that I toggle?
[20:18:48] <bapi_> expand and collapse
[20:19:00] <Coderah> bapi_: i don't know what else you would use
[20:19:16] <kborchers> MayorofDetroit: Sure
[20:19:25] <bapi_> alright, thanks
[20:23:51] <devslash> hey guys I'm having difficult understand something. I'm using the player plugin for query. my javascript code refers to the currently play song like this: document.getElementById('jquery_jplayer_1').getElementsByTagName('audio')[0].src this works fine in chrome but is not defined in firefox (I'm using firebug). is there another way to refer to the currently playing song
[20:24:49] <devslash> can someone help me out
[20:30:01] <devslash> hey is anyone here
[20:31:24] <devslash> hi Mage_Dude
[20:31:34] <Mage_Dude> Good evening
[20:31:39] <devslash> can you help me out
[20:32:00] <devslash> I'm having difficult understand something. I'm using the player plugin for query. my javascript code refers to the currently play song like this: document.getElementById('jquery_jplayer_1').getElementsByTagName('audio')[0].src this works fine in chrome but is not defined in firefox (I'm using firebug). is there another way to refer to the currently playing song
[20:33:17] <Mage_Dude> If possible, I recommend Flowplayer for playing media. It will handle both video and audio.
[20:33:23] <devslash> no
[20:33:29] <devslash> i only care about audio
[20:33:43] <devslash> and I've written everything to use jplayer
[20:34:09] <Mage_Dude> Bummer. I don't know anything about jplayer
[20:34:25] <Mage_Dude> Is the currently playing song wrapped in any sort of tag?
[20:34:33] <devslash> no
[20:34:37] <devslash> i don't think so
[20:34:54] <bapi_> Is there anyway to use slidetoggle but always make it "expand" and not hide
[20:34:55] <devslash> whats driving me crazy is that it work in google chrome
[20:35:09] <bapi_> not toggle that is :P
[20:35:14] <bapi_> slideShow in pseudo
[20:35:17] <Mage_Dude> Can you put the html into a jsfiddle/pastebin?
[20:35:31] <devslash> why don't i just give you the link
[20:35:46] <devslash> you can do view source on it
[20:35:59] <devslash> is that ok ?
[20:36:04] <Mage_Dude> Sure
[21:31:31] <dnbe> Prob a basic question, but I'm looking for a plugin/example code that will allow me to click on some plain text in html, have it fade away, and fade in replacement text.
[21:32:03] <dnbe> You could image this would be like for a riddle site were you would show the riddle and then reveal the answer on click.
[21:32:40] <dnbe> Looked through close to 50 pages of effects plugins, but nothing jumped right out at me. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
[21:34:07] <Dave_Stein> dnbe: you just need to call a few functions
[21:34:14] <Dave_Stein> dnbe: i don't think it needs a plugin
[21:34:43] <Dave_Stein> dnbe: $('#el').fadeOut(function() { $('#el').html('new text').fadeIn() });
[21:34:48] <Dave_Stein> i think thats what youre tying to do
[21:36:01] <dnbe> Dave_Stein: thanks, I had a suspicion it would be relatively easy. I was curious if there was anything packages so, e.g. I could point it at a dl's dd/dt pair.
[21:36:35] <Dave_Stein> dnbe: you can always encapsulate logc into your own functions via $.fn.mine = function() { }
[21:36:43] <dnbe> Dave_Stein: but maybe I should go with the somple thing.
[21:36:50] <dnbe> sorry, simple thing.
[22:28:42] <fourcolors> does anyone know of a good javascript plugin that will take my label for my text field and put it in my text field and make it show/hide on focus?
[22:32:02] <sontek> fourcolors: this is the firs t result on google http://kyleschaeffer.com/best-practices/input-prompt-text/
[22:32:04] <sontek> seems decent
[22:32:32] <fourcolors> ok cool thank you :)
[23:08:51] <Enchilada> Is there any reason why I should use   $(document).ready   instead of just putting my script directly just before the </body> (and without any $(document).ready) ?
[23:24:40] <lazyPower> Enchilada: i've always used $(document).ready() because i trust it more htan i do myself. no other special reason than that, that i can think of anyway
[23:26:29] <Enchilada> lazyPower: but are there any side-effects that I should worry about when putting the stuff inside     <script type="text/javascript"> /* stuff that otherwise would have been in document.ready */ </script>     ?
[23:26:42] <Enchilada> it seems to be working, but i just want to make sure that it's robust
[23:31:11] * gf3 nibbles on Enchilada
[23:31:23] <Enchilada> ;)
[23:40:05] <andy23> I am trying to display the text of a child div, but keep getting empty output. Any thoughts? The code is here.. http://jsfiddle.net/SzbpQ/
[23:40:43] <andy23> nm its here http://jsfiddle.net/SzbpQ/

[23:43:22] <andy23> anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/SzbpQ/3/
[23:44:08] <Umren> how to get links to each accordion in jqueryui ?
[23:45:01] <andy23> my code is only 2 lines.. http://jsfiddle.net/SzbpQ/3/
[23:45:50] <Coderah> andy23: ask once and wait. use .find instead of .children
[23:47:26] <andy23> awesome thanks. I had find at first but it wasn't working for some reason so I switched to children.
[23:48:31] <Coderah> andy23: children goes down one level in the dom tree. find looks through the whole thing
[23:50:22] <andy23> oh I see
