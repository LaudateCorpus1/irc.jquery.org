[00:00:18] <Cork> Ziber: what are you sending back?
[00:00:20] <Cork> json?
[00:00:23] <Cork> or just text
[00:00:30] <Ziber> What if I sent an array back?
[00:00:36] <Cork> you can't
[00:00:47] <Ziber> How would I do it if it were json?
[00:01:11] <Cork> <?php echo json_encode($arr) ?>
[00:01:23] <Ziber> Right, I meant on the JS side.
[00:01:33] <Cork> data[x]
[00:01:51] <Cork> remember to set the correct mime type in your script response
[00:02:01] <Ziber> what do you mean?
[00:02:02] <CalebIO> if you don't sound the correct mime type, it's going to return a string and you'll want to do $.parseJSON
[00:02:12] <Ziber> alright.
[00:02:38] <Cork> ?g php set response mime type json @ Ziber
[00:02:49] <bot-t> Cork, No results found for 'php set response mime type json'.
[00:03:13] <Cork> Ziber: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/267546/correct-http-header-for-json-file
[00:03:22] <Cork> thats the correct way to solve it
[00:04:23] <CalebIO> header('Content-type: application/json') I think..
[00:04:26] <CalebIO> or is it text/json?
[00:04:33] <Cork> nope application
[00:04:41] <CalebIO> thought so.
[00:04:50] <mawhtin> !help
[00:04:53] <mawhtin> http://jsbin.com/uruxef/edit#javascript,html,live
[00:05:05] <mawhtin> I'm trying to post some stuff to a database but it isn't working
[00:05:39] <Cork> mawhtin: js side is correct, so check your server code
[00:05:58] <mawhtin> i'm actually using parse.com
[00:06:07] <mawhtin> so should just work
[00:06:24] <mawhtin> cork is this part right: $( '#submit' ).on ('click', function() {
[00:06:30] <mawhtin> that was the only part I was iffy on
[00:06:43] <Cork> depends on what type of listner you want
[00:06:46] <Cork> but ya, its valid
[00:07:10] <Cork> if you want delegated/live its another syntax
[00:08:37] <mawhtin> oh no, just wanted to submit the form data for user creation
[00:08:39] <Ziber> I guess I'm missing a } somewhere. http://sandbox.liber.in/jquery/form.php - it's after 3am and I'm getting tired, i guess.
[00:09:18] <mawhtin> haha it's blank
[00:09:36] <Ziber> Yes, I know.
[00:09:38] <Ziber> See source code.
[00:09:55] <mawhtin> haha, doh
[00:09:56] <mawhtin> 3 am :P
[00:10:00] <mawhtin> well 12 here
[00:10:02] <Ziber> Already fixed the missing closing paren
[00:10:19] <Cork> Ziber: that url is still a 404
[00:10:29] <Ziber> http://sandbox.liber.in/jquery/form.php
[00:10:39] <Cork> Not Found
[00:10:39] <Cork> The requested URL /jquery/form.php was not found on this server.
[00:10:46] <Ziber> Are you connecting via ipv6 by chance?
[00:11:01] <Ziber> /exec -o host sandbox.liber.in
[00:11:03] <Ziber> please?
[00:11:10] <Cork> i have public ipv6 yes
[00:11:37] <Cork> 173.208.102.60 & 2001:470:8:eb5::ffff
[00:11:55] <Ziber> there, try now
[00:12:19] <Ziber> Wrong ipv6 address in the vhost block for apache.
[00:12:21] <Ziber> fixed now
[00:12:23] <Cork> uh...
[00:12:30] <Cork> ya the page loads, but....
[00:12:30] <Ziber> I know its blank.
[00:12:36] <Cork> 1. your missing a doctype
[00:12:37] <Ziber> There's a source code error.
[00:12:47] <Cork> 2. you never end your style tag
[00:13:08] <Ziber> Like I said, 3am.
[00:13:10] <Ziber> thanks tho
[00:13:15] <Ziber> that fixed it.
[00:13:29] <Ziber> well, except it doesnt work
[00:15:28] <Cork> f ($("#username").length > 0)) { an end parenthesis too many
[00:15:41] <Cork> check your error console
[00:16:55] <CalebIO> your best friend with JS
[00:17:35] <Ziber> fixed that, and yes, i've been watching it. apparently not triggering now though
[00:18:30] <Cork> Ziber: your server responds with 500 errors
[00:18:45] <Cork> no body
[00:19:02] <antnash> Hey guys. I've got table rows which get highlighted when clicked on, and the cells, when dblclicked on, change their contents to text inputs. How do I stop the tr being highlighted when the inputs are clicked on? Here's the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/JzHYH/13/
[00:19:03] <stenno|work> can't blame jquery for 500's :D
[00:19:13] <lyrae> problem. using the 'complete' callback on ajax calls only seems to work in firefox? in chrome, i see in console the calls are completed(and even successfull as it returns html), but everything inside 'complete: ' doesn't get called
[00:19:34] <lyrae> http://tabbit.org/zREOj this is what i have. really short
[00:19:41] <Ziber> what do you mean, no body?
[00:20:03] <lyrae> working example @ http://crobs.none.io
[00:21:46] <Cork> anthracite: http://jsfiddle.net/JzHYH/14/
[00:21:55] <Ziber> Cork: Explain?
[00:22:14] <Cork> Ziber: the ajax call gets a http status 500 response
[00:22:28] <Cork> 500 == internal server error
[00:22:44] <Ziber> Where do you see that?
[00:22:48] <Ziber> *that error
[00:22:55] <Cork> the net network tab
[00:23:09] <Ziber> eh?
[00:23:14] <Cork> uh net/network tab
[00:23:15] <stenno|work> fireb ug
[00:23:19] <stenno|work> firebug
[00:23:24] <stenno|work> or developer console
[00:23:28] <Cork> net in firebug and network in chrome
[00:23:32] <stenno|work> check the network tab, very useful :)
[00:24:22] <Ziber> ah, okay.
[00:33:38] <Ziber> Why the hell is it 500'ing?
[00:33:48] <Cork> check your php's error log
[00:35:57] <Ziber> Ah, stupid typos.
[00:36:14] <stenno|work> HTTP 500 status code
[00:36:27] <stenno|work> or every status code >= 500 and <600
[00:36:33] <stenno|work> that means 'server error'
[00:36:57] <stenno|work> 5xx
[00:37:28] <stenno|work> learn HTTP before you learn jquery :)
[00:38:00] <stenno|work> s/jquery/web development/
[00:38:47] <Ziber> I'm familiar with the HTTP status codes, I'm very new at JS and have not yet figured out the whole debugging scenario for it.
[00:38:57] <stenno|work> oh, fair enough
[00:56:15] <kasper> Maybe anybody know why this function not work? :)     ->> http://jsfiddle.net/3Xdh8/1/
[00:58:09] <Woet> kasper: because you picked mootools on the left of jsfiddle?
[00:58:28] <Woet> kasper: because you did not change your ajax request so it works with jsfiddle?
[00:59:47] <kasper> Woet, my question is why function return undefined, not object  :<
[01:00:13] <Woet> kasper: if you can't be bothered to create a working jsfiddle, why should I be bothered helping you?
[01:02:02] <kasper> Woet, how i can give ajax response in jsfiddle?
[01:02:12] <TomWij> kasper: If that's supposed to be an object, you're most likely forgetting new. IF it's not, I don't understand your jsFiddle either.
[01:02:14] <Woet> kasper: "Testing Ajax requests" on the left.
[01:04:18] <Kingsy> anyone aware of a image slider that uses a loader? so larger images can be used?
[01:07:10] <Kashkin> I would super appreciate some help with this ( http://fiddle.jshell.net/Y5anX/5/show/ ) if anyone has the time.
[01:07:48] <Zhy> What's the best way to determine whether a certain div (or any element that's contained in the div) is clicked? I want to hide the div when a click occurs outside of it's boundaries
[01:08:43] <CalebIO> Zhy not sure I understand you.. you said you want to determine whether a certain div is clicked but you want to hide the div when a click happens outside it?
[01:08:50] <CalebIO> Are you just wanting to find out whether a click happened outside of a div?
[01:09:34] <Zhy> kinda,  have a dropdown that's supposed to be closed if a click occurs and it's NOT in the dropdown... if I just close it one any click, I cannot even open the dropdown
[01:09:45] <CalebIO> ah gotcha!
[01:09:46] <Zhy> one = on
[01:09:49] <Zhy> :)
[01:09:57] <CalebIO> just use the target part of a click event.
[01:10:34] <Zhy> can I simply do something like event.target !== $('#divID') ?
[01:10:35] <Cork> Zhy: var $(div).on('click', function(event) { event.stopPropagation() }); $(document).one('click', function(event) { alert('close!') });
[01:10:45] <CalebIO> http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[01:11:09] <CalebIO> or that :p
[01:11:24] <Xotix> how cna i prevent my brwoser from loading an <im> at jquery object creation? Hope thats understandable. if i get some html as a string and create an obj out of it, it always laods the img's. i can't prevent that right?
[01:11:25] <Zhy> Ah ok , the stopPropagation part :) thanks a lot you two
[01:11:47] <Cork> you can do it with  if($('#divId').parents().andSelf().filter(event.target) > 0)
[01:11:48] <Cork> too
[01:12:10] <CalebIO> Xotix how are you creating and object out of it?
[01:12:13] <CalebIO> an**
[01:12:25] <skylamer`> Xotix whats the connection between the img html tag and jquery objects creation?
[01:13:47] <CalebIO> it shouldn't do that unless you're actually appending it to the dom
[01:13:47] <k1t> heyy folks, is there a way to chain classes with hasClass()? in other words, is there a way to shorten something like: $(this).hasClass("scene") || $(this).hasClass("scene")? Here's the snippet: https://gist.github.com/2767496
[01:14:18] <CalebIO> k1t: $(this).is('.foo, .bar')
[01:14:43] <CalebIO> oops, read what you asked wrong
[01:14:56] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/CYUWbG80
[01:14:57] <k1t> CalebIO: I think that might work though
[01:15:16] <CalebIO> ill test
[01:15:20] <k1t> me2
[01:15:52] <Xotix> I'm adding it to a temp div thats why it gets laoded probably.
[01:15:53] <CalebIO> yep it works!
[01:16:06] <CalebIO> Xotix, so you can prevent it if you don't add it to that div.
[01:16:08] <CalebIO> or hide that div..
[01:16:22] <CalebIO> or don't append it at all and just keep it stored as a variable..
[01:17:07] <skylamer`> so just if u dont want it to be loaded, dont load it
[01:17:13] <Xotix> CaleblO so how can i change the image src paths within html var?
[01:17:28] <skylamer`> or add display: none idk
[01:18:10] <Xotix> skylamer`:  i think display none worked. nice
[01:18:17] <CalebIO> test = $('<img src="test.png" />')
[01:18:23] <CalebIO> test.attr('src'. 'test2.png');
[01:18:24] <Xotix> ah no sad
[01:18:28] <CalebIO> it doesn't have to be in the DOM to edit the src..
[01:18:34] <Xotix> i want to keep the sorrounding html
[01:18:38] <CalebIO> you can create a jQuery object from a string.
[01:18:52] <Xotix> jQuery object wil lalso load afaik
[01:18:56] <Xtreme> hello guys
[01:19:05] <OffN> hi everyone, I'm actually using a basic modal form dialog(from http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-form), can someone explain how should i do to submit the form when i press enter plz? thx :)
[01:19:06] <Xtreme> is there any javascript to jquery conveter?
[01:19:26] <k1t> CalebIO: sure does, and its much more sane this way
[01:19:26] <CalebIO> Xotix are you concerned about actually loading or displaying?
[01:19:27] <k1t> ty much
[01:19:28] <k1t> :)
[01:19:50] <CalebIO> Xotix jQuery object will actually load it, but not display it until you append it
[01:19:58] <Cork> Xtreme: jquery is written in javascript, you don't need to convert things
[01:20:10] <Xotix> CalebD:  loading it generates 404 errors which are unnesecary. I'mgetting some html from a other source. Now i want to change the src paths but keep the html.
[01:20:28] <Xtreme> i meant i have a code for tooltip in javascritp. but they need jqury in javascript
[01:22:26] <CalebIO> Xotix is this meant to be abstract or hardcoded?  could you just regex replace it before you actually create the HTML for the DOM?
[01:22:47] <Cork> Xtreme: normally you can't automatically convert pure js to jquery,
[01:23:07] <Cork> Xtreme: you can write pure js in too many different ways to make a conversion like that
[01:23:27] <Cork> most of the time you don't need to rewrite it though
[01:24:28] <Cork> Xotix: only way to prevent image loading if you parse to dom is to remove the src lines from the string BEFORE parsing it
[01:24:49] <Xotix> CalebIO: basically I'm getting the html. it contains images with a src like: src="picName.jpg/png/.." and then I'm adding the path to the public dir. proably its possible with regex but idk f there is some function in js which helps me here. eve used regex in JS.
[01:24:55] <Cork> a dom image loads its resource as soon as it gets a src value
[01:25:28] <Cork> document.createElement('img').src= 'some/url.png'; will try to load it
[01:26:05] <Zhy> Hmm this is strange, in my click function for the dropdown,  $('#searchListDropdown').toggleClass('notVisible'); (custom class) does not work, but     $('#searchListDropdown').toggle('blind', 10); does... both times followed by an event.stopPropagation()
[01:26:10] <Zhy> Does anyone have an idea why that is?
[01:26:22] <OffN> ok i found my answer, thx anyway :p (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/868889/submit-jquery-ui-dialog-on-enter) ^^
[01:26:24] <Zhy> It's working as it should now but I'm curious :)
[01:26:51] <Xotix> Cokr ok thanks. hmm regex my be okay but also might be more error prone.
[01:27:03] <Cork> Xotix: ya, but its the only way
[01:27:15] <CalebIO> Xotix give me an example of a src you have and a src you want to replace it with
[01:27:23] <Cork> should be fairly stable to do though
[01:27:47] <Cork> Zhy: toggleClass should work just fine
[01:27:57] <Cork> (the way you pasted it there)
[01:28:36] <Cork> toggle runs show/hide so its quite different
[01:30:31] <Xotix> CalebIO:  e.g. http://pastebin.com/SX4hQg0U
[01:30:52] <Zhy> Cork thanks for your answer, I was just wondering since I'm using toggleClass in other contexts without any problems
[01:31:41] <Cork> Zhy: toggleClass doesn't animate without jquery-ui though, that might be what your seeing?
[01:33:50] <lyrae> once i have php return this  echo json_encode(array('content' => $html, 'num' => $i));, how do i interpret that in jquery's ajax callbacks? i tried data.content, but doesnt work
[01:34:05] <Kashkin> Hey guys. I cannot figure out where in this code the animation for the first click is being defined: http://fiddle.jshell.net/Y5anX/5/show/
[01:34:25] <Cork> lyrae: make sure the php script sets the mime header header
[01:34:30] <Cork> -header
[01:34:41] <Cork> lyrae: and jquery will do the rest
[01:35:08] <Cork> lyrae: header('Content-type: application/json');
[01:36:53] <Zhy> Cork I just tested, it does work, only not with my 'notVisible' class which sets display: none;
[01:37:11] <lyrae> Cork: doesnt seem to work still.
[01:37:42] <Cork> lyrae: you have a link?
[01:37:45] <lyrae> when i do, for instance, console.log(data.num)
[01:37:48] <lyrae> it says undefined
[01:37:55] <lyrae> yes let me upload, one sec
[01:38:41] <lyrae> Cork: http://crobs.none.io/
[01:40:08] <crashev> anyone knows what to use in chrome/others to emulate Mozilla's eventObj.originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget ?
[01:42:14] <Cork> lyrae: set dataType: 'json' in the ajaxq call
[01:42:55] <Cork> lyrae: btw you should replace your doctype with a less hacky one
[01:44:01] <lyrae> wait a minute playa. one thing at a time
[01:44:05] <lyrae> (jk)
[01:44:19] <tocka> Morning
[01:44:22] <Kingsy> anyone aware of a image slider that uses a loader? so larger images can be used?
[01:44:22] <lyrae> I had dataType json in there, i took it out to let jquery guess it instead, because it wasn't working
[01:48:21] <joshauh> hello there, i am running ten textboxes which eachone should open a datepicker window.. but it only seems to work on the first box and the rest will not work.. any idea why?
[01:48:43] <joshauh> i.e.
[01:48:51] <joshauh> <input type="text" name="date1" readonly id="datepicker">
[01:48:54] <joshauh> <input type="text" name="date2" readonly id="datepicker">
[01:48:55] <joshauh> etc
[01:50:03] <Cork> joshauh: you can't have the same id on multiple element
[01:50:05] <Cork> +s
[01:50:16] <joshauh> hmm
[01:50:20] <joshauh> so what would be the work around ??
[01:50:24] <Cork> class
[01:50:33] <joshauh> id="datepicker[0]? ?
[01:50:37] <Cork> <input type="text" name="date2" readonly class="datepicker">
[01:50:43] <joshauh> i see
[01:51:03] <Cork> or if you want to have a uniq id sure set a number in the string
[01:52:06] <joshauh> so do i need to change the 	$(function() { ???
[01:52:11] <joshauh> $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();
[01:52:15] <joshauh> as its not working now ?? :S
[01:52:16] <diverdude> if i do $(function() { return value;}); where is value then returned to?
[01:52:23] <Cork> $( ".datepicker" )
[01:52:35] <Cork> diverdude: it doens't
[01:52:50] <stenno|work> joshauh, learn html and basic css before you do jquery :o
[01:53:01] <Cork> joshauh: $( ".datepicker" ).datepicker();
[01:53:09] <diverdude> Cork: strange... i have a lib here that does that so i think maybe you are wrong
[01:53:20] <joshauh> diverdude you need to echo instead of return right???
[01:53:31] <stenno|work> so many question marks...
[01:53:54] <joshauh> Cork: thank you sir!
[01:54:28] <Cork> diverdude: well the only thing it can do is prevent later event listners from triggering
[01:54:36] <stenno|work> diverdude, to the parent scope, i'd say
[01:54:42] <Cork> diverdude: theres nothing else happening with the return value
[01:55:11] <stenno|work> well it _has_ to be returned somewhere
[01:55:14] <Cork> diverdude: and i meant nothing handles it except for the loop break action
[01:55:21] <stenno|work> just don't expect that this value is stored
[01:55:39] <diverdude> its the lightbox lib. moment i will show you a paste
[01:56:01] <tompaw> Hello.
[01:56:14] <stenno|work> hello
[01:56:21] <diverdude> Cork: here: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/blob/master/js/lightbox.js   in line 348
[01:56:36] <diverdude> Cork: this link: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/blob/master/js/lightbox.js#L348
[01:57:01] <tompaw> I want to use jquery ui with my page, but the problem is I use a separate server to serve static content. Long story short - is there a single place where I can specify a http url prefix for all the images used by jquery ui's CSS?
[01:57:05] <Xtreme> guys how to create datepicker in form?
[01:57:38] <tompaw> Xtreme: $(dom_element).datepicker({options});
[01:57:42] <stenno|work> Xtreme, just bind to a jquery object or list of objects
[01:58:09] <Cork> diverdude: that looks a bit egocentric, it kills the ready event loop if it fails to initialize LightBox
[01:58:39] <diverdude> Cork: lol...so if lightbox fails the page fails?
[01:58:57] <stenno|work> other way around
[01:58:58] <test> hi wats the difference between .live and .on
[01:59:02] <stenno|work> oh no
[01:59:25] <tompaw> test: I think live is deprecated, isn't it?
[01:59:35] <stenno|work> diverdude, right
[01:59:38] <Cork> diverdude: yes
[01:59:41] <tompaw> it's slightly different way of calling it, AFAIR
[01:59:59] <stenno|work> but .on is not live, right?
[02:00:03] <diverdude> stenno|work:  Cork: do you know a good alternative to lightbox? I dont really like this lib so much anyway because it does not allow the programmer to set any options. Everything is hardcoded
[02:00:05] <stenno|work> does it look up in the future, too?
[02:00:06] <tompaw> for me, it is
[02:00:14] <stenno|work> diverdude, what does lightbox do anyway?
[02:00:31] <test> tompaw : thanks you.. so it shd usefull for dynamic dom addition ?
[02:00:33] <diverdude> stenno|work: its a gallery. Makes a modal box for images like the one facebook has
[02:00:34] <Cork> stenno|work: live is on in newer jquery
[02:00:42] <stenno|work> i see
[02:00:50] <Cork> stenno|work: but yes, on can express delegated event listners
[02:00:59] <Cork> ?.on
[02:01:06] <joshauh> what about thickbox?
[02:01:09] <diverdude> any suggestions?
[02:01:12] <tompaw> test: I use it with dynamic dom like that: $(document).on(event, dom, function); and so far didn't have any issues.
[02:01:19] <joshauh> http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
[02:01:21] <stenno|work> diverdude, twitter bootstrap :)

[02:01:54] <LukeNukem> coldhead, hey you up?
[02:02:00] <Cork> stenno|work: check the delegate section in the page http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[02:02:04] <test> oh good..let me chk
[02:02:16] <LukeNukem> im having an issue, im trying to grab the value of an href of an element
[02:02:25] <LukeNukem> if there are 2 elements, it grabs the value of the first one
[02:02:27] <stenno|work> Cork, thanks
[02:02:32] <LukeNukem> i need value of both elements, how can i achieve this
[02:02:34] <joshauh> diverdude why not use thickbox???? http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
[02:02:52] <Xtreme> tompaw:  $("#datepicker").datepicker is not a function
[02:02:56] <Xtreme> any suggesstion
[02:03:06] <stenno|work> Xtreme, include jquery-ui
[02:03:07] <wib> load jQuery UI first
[02:03:07] <LukeNukem> Xtreme,
[02:03:21] <stenno|work> joshauh, do you think we are stupid?
[02:03:21] <Xtreme> i have loaded it
[02:03:23] <Cork> Lucky--: var hrefs = $.map($(selector), function(elm) { return $(elm).prop('href'); });
[02:03:37] <wib> Xtreme: and make sure you don't use a custom one that don't have datepicker included
[02:03:37] <stenno|work> joshauh, if not, why are you not using _a single_ question mark?
[02:03:47] <Cork> *LukeNukem
[02:03:54] <stenno|work> do you think we don't notice that it is a question?
[02:04:00] <joshauh> called habit :)
[02:04:05] <tompaw> Xtreme: it works for me, so you probably didn't include the source code for datepicker
[02:04:11] <stenno|work> bad habit :<
[02:04:20] <joshauh> stenno|work don't you have any?
[02:04:21] <stenno|work> but fair enough i guess
[02:04:23] <joshauh> :P
[02:04:49] <stenno|work> you know what terry pratchett says about people who you use multiple punctuation marks?
[02:04:57] <joshauh> no?
[02:05:04] <joshauh> i mean no???
[02:05:08] <joshauh> j/k:)
[02:05:10] <stenno|work> he says: They wear their underwear on their heads
[02:05:11] <stenno|work> :)
[02:05:28] <joshauh> .....
[02:05:39] <diverdude> stenno|work: i dont think twitter bootstrap has such a component
[02:05:43] <stenno|work> http://wiki.lspace.org/wiki/Multiple_exclamation_marks
[02:05:48] <stenno|work> diverdude, it has, sec
[02:07:01] <stenno|work> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
[02:07:39] <diverdude> stenno|work: but it needs to be in modal mode
[02:07:56] <stenno|work> well there are modals for bootstrap, too :)
[02:08:06] <stenno|work> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
[02:08:34] <diverdude> stenno|work: hmm so i nest such a carousel in a modal box?
[02:08:35] <stenno|work> maybe you can combine that
[02:08:35] <Xtreme> okay guys. i fixed the funciton thing
[02:08:40] <Xtreme> function error
[02:08:44] <Xtreme> but the theme for calender
[02:08:47] <Xtreme> how to configure it?
[02:09:02] <stenno|work> diverdude, i don't know if its possible, its just a guess, but that would be my try
[02:09:35] <stenno|work> Xtreme, http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[02:09:46] <stenno|work> there, under the 'Theming' tag

[02:15:33] <poppiez> hi, I have a problem with opera. if I replace an image with the same image while it's being loaded, there's a quick flash. any idea on how to fix that?
[02:16:08] <Cork> don't replace the image with the same image?
[02:16:30] <poppiez> Cork: lol, I need to
[02:17:41] <Cork> its probably aborting the image decoding and restarts it and thats what cause the flash
[02:17:54] <Cork> *causes
[02:17:58] <poppiez> Cork: it doesn't restart. it starts from where it picked up
[02:18:10] <poppiez> but it seems it's slow to get the image from the cache perhaps
[02:18:23] <Dov_Rine> Is it ok to ask for help with jquery plugins here?
[02:18:54] <CalebIO> sure
[02:19:04] <Cork> poppiez: rendering an image has three steps: 1) download the image from the server / load it from cache, 2) decode the image to raw 3) draw the image data
[02:19:39] <Cork> poppiez: and i suspect it restarts the decoding and thats what causes the flash
[02:20:26] <poppiez> Cork: good to know - but it might be the drawing that's slow too. that's what I had problems with yesterday too
[02:20:46] <Cork> poppiez: no yesterday was the same decode on visible
[02:20:58] <Cork> its not drawing thats slow
[02:21:04] <poppiez> Cork: I see
[02:21:07] <Cork> its to save memory
[02:21:11] <poppiez> Cork: the images are gzipped - could that be the issue?
[02:21:37] <Cork> thats only during http transfer
[02:21:48] <Cork> its stored on disk uncompressed
[02:21:52] <poppiez> okay
[02:21:53] <poppiez> hmm
[02:21:56] <Cork> but encoded
[02:22:07] <LukeNukem> Cork, can you show me how to use it :\
[02:22:12] <Cork> (png, jpg or gif normally)
[02:22:47] <poppiez> Cork: they are jpgs
[02:22:52] <Cork> LukeNukem: it will give you an array with all the hrefs
[02:23:04] <Dov_Rine> I'm trying to setup a nested layout using layout.js, but I'm starting to think that what I'm doing isn't covered in the docs at all.  I'm using a standard layout that has the center pane updated by adding a new tab that gets its contents from an ajax call.  I'm trying to send content that would contain its own layout.  The docready fires, console.log shows the layout object with valid properties, but none of the content actually displays
[02:23:04] <Dov_Rine> .  Is this a valid use case for the layout.js plugin?
[02:23:13] <LukeNukem> Cork, elm should be the selector?
[02:23:21] <Cork> LukeNukem: no
[02:23:31] <Cork> elm is what $.map gives to the callback function
[02:23:32] <LukeNukem> ok o
[02:23:55] <LukeNukem> how can i display this array
[02:24:00] <Cork> poppiez: so when it needs to load it from cache it first loads the jpg file, then decodes it so each pixel has its own full color value, then draws it
[02:24:28] <Cork> poppiez: modern browsers discard, and delay this as much as possible cause that image map takes up loads of memory
[02:24:30] <libin> how do i get the values from a json object from the server to a variable in javascipt
[02:24:40] <Cork> (10x jpg format easily)
[02:24:49] <libin> i have done the code.. but rather than displaying values it shows 1, 2,3....
[02:25:19] <Cork> libin: your sending valid json string, and with the correct mimetype=
[02:25:21] <Cork> *?
[02:25:35] <diverdude> is it possible to use jquery UI's modal box for displaying images ?
[02:26:23] <Cork> sure
[02:26:27] <LukeNukem> Cork, how can i display the array content
[02:26:41] <libin> yes it should be.. coz i am using the controller in the asp.net mvc3 to create a json for me automatically from the model that i have
[02:26:43] <stenno|work> console.log
[02:26:48] <Cork> LukeNukem: console.log(arr)
[02:26:51] <Dov_Rine> LukeNukem: use firebug
[02:26:51] <LukeNukem> k
[02:27:20] <poppiez> Cork: so basically, I'm screwed :P
[02:28:39] <Cork> poppiez: you can mitigate, but ya, its a feature of the browser
[02:29:40] <libin> @Cork Its a valid json( atleast i presume)
[02:30:00] <Cork> libin: php?
[02:30:59] <Dov_Rine> libin: this link might help you: http://betterexplained.com/articles/using-json-to-exchange-data/
[02:31:13] <Dov_Rine> libin: be careful using eval, though.
[02:31:41] <libin> no.. asp.net mvc
[02:32:00] <libin> thanks dov.. i will try that now
[02:32:25] <CalebIO> night guys
[02:33:02] <Dov_Rine> is anyone here familiar with the layout.js plugin?  I'm just trying to figure out if what I'm trying to do should work or not.
[02:33:15] <libin> i dont know if its a lame question, but is there any tool or anyway that i can see how the json object looks like
[02:33:24] <Dov_Rine> libin: firebug
[02:33:31] <CalebIO> inspect element in chrome or firebug
[02:33:37] <CalebIO> console.log(object);  will output it nice.
[02:33:56] <CalebIO> console.log({test: "hey"});
[02:34:08] <libin> ok
[02:34:12] <Dov_Rine> libin: on the php side, you can echo it
[02:34:13] <libin> thanks Dov
[02:34:50] <CalebIO> <?php header('Content-type: application/json');  echo json_encode($array); ?>
[02:36:25] <Dov_Rine> no one here uses layout.js?  Is there a different layout plugin I should be looking at?
[02:38:52] <sca> Anybody knows what the official name of the "ajax-loader" technique is (hourglass, loader, etc). I need it for documentation.
[02:39:19] <stenno|work> spinner?
[02:39:22] <sca> The name of the technique itself that is...
[02:39:31] <CalebIO> waiting indicator?
[02:39:35] <stenno|work> spinner!
[02:39:51] <Dov_Rine> The technique is ajax.
[02:39:55] <stenno|work> `g jquery spinner
[02:39:55] <caniuse> stenno|work: How to show loading spinner in jQuery? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68485/how-to-show-loading-spinner-in-jquery
[02:39:58] <crescent_sun> I am a js/jquery noob.. I am having some issue with my code. I am trying to bind 3 functions to one event and then unbind once the even occurs 3 times. I can paste my code someone if someone would like
[02:40:24] <stenno|work> crescent_sun, posting code is always good ... try gist.github.com
[02:40:52] <stenno|work> or jsfiddle.com
[02:40:55] <stenno|work> com?
[02:41:00] <Dov_Rine> sca: are you referring to the technique of displaying a waiting indicator and then switching it for the content when the ajax call finishes?
[02:41:06] <sca> Spinner is nice, but maybe there is a more technical name for a technique that notifies the user to wait for result.
[02:41:23] <sca> Dov_Rine: yes
[02:41:29] <stenno|work> jsfiddle.net
[02:42:00] <CalebIO> sca a waiting indicator.
[02:42:13] <Dov_Rine> sca: There are a lot of different techniques for that, but they all depend on the ready state returned by the request.
[02:42:20] <stenno|work> spinner is good enough imho :<
[02:43:19] <Dov_Rine> sca: maybe you want some kind of DOM manipulation technique name
[02:44:23] <crescent_sun> ok I pasted part of my jquery code in http://jsfiddle.net/C3Vdt/
[02:44:32] <sca> Dov_Rine: No, just a general technical name - that can describe a jquery spinner/loader as well as the Windows hourglass or OS X wheel
[02:47:35] <crescent_sun> sca maybe activity or progress  indicactor
[02:48:58] <Dov_Rine> sca: the hourglass and wheel are cursors / pointers.  The loader message is whatever you decide to use for it.  jQuery doesn't create one for you, as far as I know.  If you are using css to accomplish this by switching classes or something, then maybe you are looking for something like the css image swap
[02:49:27] <sca> crescent_sun: thanks, I think I will go for "Activity indicator", that describes it well enough
[02:49:39] <sca> thanks guys
[02:49:42] <Dov_Rine> sca: gl
[02:49:44] <diverdude> stenno|work: did you use the twitter bootstrap before?
[02:50:10] <crashev> I have <form id="test"...><input type="text" />.... <button class="submit">Submit</button> <button class="cancel">Cancel</button></form> how totell from: if $('#test').submit(function(e) {});  ->  which button was clicked?
[02:50:11] <sca> *completing last details of my bachelor thesis*
[02:51:41] <diverdude> stenno|work: i tried to create a modal , but i get: Object #myModal has no method 'modal'
[02:51:49] <crescent_sun> crashev: I have been informed that a good place to place your code is  http://jsfiddle.net
[02:52:17] <diverdude> stenno|work: i tried to follow the example in the tutorial
[02:53:39] <Dov_Rine> crescent_sun: you are trying to bind 3 different functions to the same event?
[02:53:40] <diverdude> stenno|work: it is like the example is incomplete
[02:53:55] <stenno|work> diverdude, it seems you have to download the modal.js file first
[02:54:05] <crescent_sun> dov_rine: yes
[02:54:11] <stenno|work> there is a download link here http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/js/bootstrap-modal.js
[02:54:24] <stenno|work> s/download link/the link to the js/
[02:54:46] <Dov_Rine> crescent_sun: i think that you will probably have to bind a single function and handle the control details in that one
[02:55:38] <diverdude> stenno|work: but i already downloaded the zip file for the framework
[02:55:38] <Dov_Rine> crescent_sun: I'm not sure of that, though.
[02:56:15] <crescent_sun> dov_rine: ok.. as said I am noob and this is some practice work.. I am going to a hack session tomorrow so I will ask some of the people there
[02:57:04] <Dov_Rine> crescent_sun: I found this that might be right for you:  http://forums.devarticles.com/javascript-development-22/multiple-functions-for-event-6581.html
[02:57:28] <diverdude> stenno|work: it did not help downloading ad include the bootstrap-modal.js
[02:57:43] <crescent_sun> dov_rine: thx I will check it out
[02:58:07] <stenno|work> diverdude, so your firebug / developer console shows the bootstrap-modal.js is loaded correctly?
[02:59:03] <diverdude> stenno|work: yes. no problems loading the js files
[02:59:12] <diverdude> stenno|work: those are all fine.
[02:59:53] <stenno|work> diverdude, jquery too?
[02:59:54] <diverdude> stenno|work: but when i add this to my page:
[02:59:56] <diverdude> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1174086990
[03:00:01] <diverdude> i get the error
[03:00:13] <diverdude> stenno|work: jquery works fine also
[03:00:18] <Dov_Rine> crescent_sun: now that I think about it, it has to be possible.  I think that's how the jquery docready function works.
[03:00:50] <Dov_Rine> crescent_sun: why is your event called click.ed?  maybe you just aren't using a valid event name in your code.
[03:00:52] <stenno|work> diverdude, to check again: in the js you do on document.ready $("#myModal").modal() ?
[03:01:09] <globe_tmp> guys i got a json data under this form http://pastie.org/3949092 and when i try to loop over it with my function http://pastie.org/3949105   , i got  the impression that the browser doesn't close the connection
[03:01:15] <globe_tmp> it keep waiting for something
[03:02:44] <globe_tmp> is anything suspicious with my processing ?
[03:02:46] <Dov_Rine> globe_tmp: did you try it with a simpler test json object?
[03:03:36] <globe_tmp> Dov_Rine: yu mean reduced set of information ?
[03:03:40] <globe_tmp> nop
[03:03:42] <diverdude> stenno|work: yeah... i do this: $(function(){$("#myModal").modal();});  but nothing happens when i click the modal link
[03:04:17] <diverdude> stenno|work: and the markup is visible on the page
[03:04:21] <Dov_Rine> globe_tmp: yes, just to make sure that your iterator isn't accidentally looping infinitely
[03:04:27] <stenno|work> what do you mean, nothing happens
[03:04:32] <stenno|work> do you get an error or not?
[03:04:46] <globe_tmp> Dov_Rine: ok trying it
[03:05:36] <diverdude> stenno|work: hmm no that error which was there before is gone..thats strange
[03:06:23] <crescent_sun> Dov_rine: that is because I am using jquery and with jquery you can group event name by using a suffix so you can group clicks with click.suffix.. the reason to use this is that it allows you to unbind muliple with one statement $('*').unbind('click.suffix').. if I take out the if statement out it still work.. but I think you might have a point with having to do this inside the called function
[03:06:24] <diverdude> stenno|work: should some css also be included?
[03:06:57] <Whirl3d> anybody understand deferred.pipe() method?
[03:07:28] <diverdude> stenno|work: the lib comes with these css files: bootstrap.css  bootstrap.min.css  bootstrap-responsive.css  bootstrap-responsive.min.css but i dont know if they are included automatically by the js or if i need to include any of those manually
[03:07:32] <stenno|work> diverdude, if you want
[03:07:40] <stenno|work> bootstrap is css mainly
[03:07:47] <stenno|work> you just have to set the classes
[03:07:59] <stenno|work> of the element to get it nicely styled
[03:08:05] <Dov_Rine> globe_tmp: I also noticed that your data is partially escaped in the pastebin.  I don't know how much of that you did yourself or the paste site did for you.  It seems conceivable to me that some of your data might be breaking your page by not being valid, accidentally creating a tag somewhere, or breaking the function itself somehow.
[03:08:22] <stenno|work> its a 'css framework', the modal and carousel stuff is just additional functionality
[03:08:40] <Dov_Rine> globe_tmp: as a side point, why are you using document.write instead of element.append() ?
[03:08:54] <stenno|work> it takes from the programmer the responsibility to take care of a coherent design
[03:08:58] <diverdude> stenno|work: i see... ok... but do you know why the modal does not show up when i click the link?
[03:09:04] <stenno|work> so its awesome ^^"
[03:09:14] <bLUEE> question: i am using jquery .load to get some info, but its giving me a 404. when i click the url in the inspector, the loads the page just fine - any ideas ?
[03:09:15] <Dov_Rine> globe_tmp: you can try using the firebug profiler, too.  It might help you narrow down the problem.
[03:09:21] <diverdude> stenno|work: yes it does seem quite nice...i just need to learn how to use it hehehe
[03:09:47] <stenno|work> its very very easy, as i said
[03:10:01] <diverdude> stenno|work: then i must be very very stupid :(
[03:10:07] <poppiez> any way to do this more efficiently/smarter? $div.children('.test').remove().end().children().show();
[03:10:35] <globe_tmp> Dov_Rine: document.write just copy / paste from a tuto on the web ... :d
[03:10:44] <globe_tmp> yeah trying to use firebug
[03:11:03] <Dov_Rine> bLUEE: try to alert the url instead of .load it and see if it's still the same as what's in the inspector.  it might be in a different context.
[03:11:08] <diverdude> stenno|work: since i cannot get that modal to pop up
[03:11:30] <bLUEE> Dov_Rine: let me try that - thanks
[03:11:49] <Dov_Rine> no one with any experience using layout.js?
[03:11:54] <stenno|work> eh sorry, just read the docs, everything should be there :| i haven't worked with it, too, but the js plugins from bootstrap i used so far, worked fine and as expected
[03:12:50] <diverdude> stenno|work: i just did exactly what it says to do in the docs
[03:13:28] <stenno|work> diverdude, time to paste your code :)
[03:14:48] <shoky_> Whirl3d: yo
[03:14:58] <crescent_sun> dov_rine: your advise helped me out thx
[03:15:08] <diverdude> stenno|work: here it is: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/246430356
[03:15:17] <bLUEE> Dov_Rine: weird, it is it the same - but cant understand the 404 ?
[03:15:33] <Dov_Rine> crescent_sun: you're welcome
[03:16:05] <Dov_Rine> bLUEE: is it a relative url? if so, change it to the full thing for testing
[03:16:28] <Whirl3d> shoky! Yeah! I am still not understanding the pipe thing. Any suggestions?
[03:17:10] <diverdude> stenno|work: looks like the example right?
[03:17:21] <Dov_Rine> bLUEE: if not, then try doing something like alert(url.length) and make sure that the number of chars is exactly right
[03:17:38] <globe_tmp> Dov_Rine:  trying with this reduced set http://pastie.org/3949161  but same prob , firefox seems to have unfinished businesss !
[03:17:58] <shoky_> Whirl3d: hmm, you've used it a few times, you don't understand what it did exactly?
[03:18:00] <Dov_Rine> globe_tmp: ok, give me a sec\
[03:18:10] <bLUEE> Dov_Rine: same thing! doesnt it somehow think its cross domain or something like that ?
[03:18:13] <Whirl3d> basically, I have a series of things that I need to happen in a specific sequence, all conditional based on the other.
[03:18:35] <Whirl3d> Shoky, never used it. I tried to, but had to find another workaround in a pinch.
[03:18:50] <Dov_Rine> bLUEE: is it cross domain?
[03:18:54] <shoky_> Whirl3d: mm i gotta go to work, but i'll be online from there as `poo soon ;P
[03:19:11] <bLUEE> Dov_Rine: nop !
[03:19:12] <stenno|work> diverdude, what happens if you do $("#myModal").modal("show"); manually after bind?
[03:19:15] <Dov_Rine> bLUEE: try putting the url into an <a> and see if you can click through it
[03:19:19] <shoky_> ~30min
[03:19:51] <Whirl3d> right on. I'll keep googlin till I hear back from ya. Thanks.
[03:20:13] <diverdude> stenno|work: it was because i had to include the css also
[03:20:21] <stenno|work> eh
[03:20:24] <stenno|work> strange
[03:20:27] <diverdude> stenno|work: that was not written enywhere :/
[03:20:31] <stenno|work> yeah
[03:20:35] <stenno|work> didn't expect that
[03:20:40] <stenno|work> makes sense though, actually
[03:20:55] <diverdude> stenno|work: yeah...but still..they should write that i think
[03:21:14] <diverdude> stenno|work: thx man :)
[03:21:24] <Dov_Rine> poppiez: what is that statement you put up supposed to do?
[03:21:35] <diverdude> stenno|work: do you know what is this bootstrap.responsive.css?
[03:21:35] <globe_tmp> Dov_Rine:  i think it's because of document.write
[03:21:41] <globe_tmp> sorry my mistake !
[03:21:49] <stenno|work> diverdude, no idea, sorry
[03:21:49] <Dov_Rine> globe_tmp: did you fix it?
[03:22:09] <diverdude> stenno|work: ack...this css f... up all my other css
[03:22:16] <globe_tmp> Dov_Rine: Yeap , thanks for your help  :d
[03:22:29] <Dov_Rine> globe_tmp: np.  i'm glad it worked out
[03:22:35] <stenno|work> diverdude, argh
[03:23:42] <bLUEE> Dov_Rine: just noticed something weird, when i open the page itself in a browser tab - it loads the content, but the actual header status is 404
[03:23:45] <diverdude> stenno|work: well...maybe i shuld use this css part of the framework also...i am using such html 5 boilerplate and such now
[03:23:47] <tanepiper> anyone help with a .data question, i have a video tag that looks like https://gist.github.com/3bac9c3279c8dbec2c05 and I want to do $("video").data('next') - but what I get back is a string, not an array of objects although it is valid - any ideas why?
[03:23:50] <BojanBG> Question: Say I have div#div and I have selected it with var div = $('#div');  now That div has some children, how do I select those children but just by referencing the div Variable? ( Is something like $(div, ".children") possible, I remember doing something like that before )
[03:23:53] <diverdude> stenno|work: maybe this is better
[03:24:15] <Dov_Rine> stenno|work: i have no experience with the plugin you are referring to, but i know that a few of the ones that I've used have settings for a prefix that you can define that the plugin will prepend to its own classes so that you can protect a namespace.  maybe the one that you are using has a similar option.
[03:24:21] <stenno|work> yes, bootstrap is sexy
[03:24:29] <stenno|work> i do the same thing in my project
[03:24:43] <diverdude> stenno|work: with html5 boilerplate and bootstrap together?
[03:24:54] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: div.children()
[03:25:07] <stenno|work> i dunno how bootstrap works with boilerplate
[03:25:31] <diverdude> stenno|work: so how do you use the bootstrap. what functionality from the framework?
[03:25:32] <BojanBG> dov_rine, how about div.children('.Children') will that select everything recursively below with that class
[03:25:53] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: correct
[03:25:59] <BojanBG> I need the equivelent of: $('#div .children');
[03:26:00] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: sorry
[03:26:06] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: not recursively
[03:26:20] <BojanBG> dov_rine, how would I pull of a equiv of that line?
[03:27:05] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: one sec.  it might.  let me try it.
[03:27:19] <stenno|work> diverdude, right now i mostly use the css http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html and http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html
[03:29:46] <diverdude> stenno|work: okay. and why do you like it so much?
[03:30:34] <stenno|work> diverdude, well it takes a lot of work off the programmer, no?
[03:31:03] <stenno|work> you have a coherent style over the whole page
[03:31:31] <stenno|work> just adding a class to an element to have sexy styling is nice
[03:31:36] <stenno|work> for example here http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#navbar
[03:31:40] <diverdude> stenno|work: true. that is nuce
[03:31:53] <stenno|work> you add class='navbar' to a div and then you get sexy css
[03:32:25] <stenno|work> the real pros don't like it though
[03:32:28] <stenno|work> css pros
[03:32:28] <diverdude> stenno|work: yeah ok..thats cool...and can i change the appearance?
[03:32:34] <stenno|work> they want full flexibility
[03:32:35] <stenno|work> you ... can
[03:32:53] <stenno|work> you have to check the customize options at downloading
[03:33:10] <stenno|work> it is customizable, but it may be annoying to customize it
[03:33:10] <diverdude> stenno|work: yeah ok...and remove eg. the search box and such?
[03:33:15] <Aha2Y> Can anyone tell me what i am doing wrong at http://jsfiddle.net/6U32p/1/ ?
[03:33:15] <stenno|work> thats why the pros don't like it
[03:33:44] <diverdude> stenno|work: yeah ok....i see why it may be nice
[03:33:59] <Aha2Y> Wups http://jsfiddle.net/6U32p/1/ i meant.
[03:34:00] <stenno|work> diverdude, the search bar is just an example
[03:34:23] <stenno|work> diverdude, look the markup stands on the right side below the search bar
[03:35:08] <stenno|work> that would render a navbar like that, but with search bar and so
[03:35:15] <stenno|work> just inspect the html of the navbar
[03:36:02] <stenno|work> really, the only thing you do with bootstrap is setting classes
[03:36:08] <stenno|work> the markup is just your normal markup
[03:36:18] <stenno|work> it is simply a css library or framework
[03:36:31] <stenno|work> which offers certain styles for certain classes
[03:36:38] <stenno|work> it is up to you what markup you use where
[03:38:50] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: div.children() is not recursive
[03:39:15] <BojanBG> dov_rine, I know :) btw $(div, '.children') works
[03:39:54] <BojanBG> I thought it might, but was not 100% sure
[03:40:02] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: thanks.  I'm sure that will come in handy.
[03:40:12] <bLUEE> question: if i am using $(img).on('load', function () {}.. to see when the image is loaded. this works fine.. but when i do it again, since the image is already loaded the function isnt fired.. is there a way to catch that event ?
[03:40:17] <BojanBG> definetly :) cheers!
[03:40:54] <ravenzz> bLUEE what do you mean when i do it again?
[03:41:04] <ravenzz> when you reload the page?
[03:41:08] <bLUEE> when i have a click event that loads an image..
[03:41:26] <bLUEE> and it loads fine. but when i click again, since its loaded, the .on/load isnt called
[03:41:42] <ravenzz> demo?
[03:41:57] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: $(div, '.children') isn't recursive either
[03:42:07] <BojanBG> dov_rine, really?
[03:42:13] <bLUEE> do you see what i mean ?
[03:42:22] <BojanBG> div_rine, it worked in my test :/
[03:42:31] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: never mind, i had a typo
[03:42:36] <BojanBG> dov_rine :D
[03:43:37] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: it's not recursive after fixing the typo now either ...
[03:43:53] <crescent_sun> when using the console.log function where to does the information go?
[03:43:57] <BojanBG> dov_Rine hahaha :)
[03:44:10] <BojanBG> dov_Rine, really cus it worked in my scenario
[03:44:16] <stenno|work> crescent_sun, to the console :)
[03:44:35] <stenno|work> crescent_sun. to the developer console of the browser, usually
[03:44:47] <sdepold> want to develop jquery plugins the tdd way? https://github.com/dawanda/jquery.skeleton
[03:44:58] <stenno|work> therefore the js might _break_ if you don't have console
[03:45:10] <crescent_sun> stenno|work: thx for the the second response
[03:45:18] <Dov_Rine> in my test I made a div with the following structure: a ul with another nested ul inside it
[03:45:36] <BojanBG> and? what did it select, just the first ul?
[03:45:40] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: i made one of the li tags in each list class=children
[03:45:40] <BojanBG> not the second?
[03:46:10] <BojanBG> and it selected just the first?
[03:46:12] <Dov_Rine> then i did alert($(div, '.children').length)
[03:46:15] <Dov_Rine> it gave me 1
[03:46:35] <BojanBG> hmmmmm
[03:46:45] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: removing the class from the first child gives me 0
[03:47:04] <BojanBG> I have the exact scenario, let me recheck sec...
[03:48:17] <BojanBG> you are right Dov_Rine it doesn't work
[03:48:34] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: sorry
[03:48:45] <BojanBG> way to burst my bubble :)
[03:49:24] <BojanBG> dov_rine, so how the hell do I write that now :D
[03:50:14] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: One sec.  There has to be a normal css selector to select all descendents of an element.  I'm going to look it up.
[03:51:13] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: found it
[03:51:22] <BojanBG> dov_rine, listening
[03:51:31] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4910077/select-all-child-elements
[03:51:59] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: I'm testing it now
[03:52:31] <BojanBG> not really what I need :)
[03:52:41] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: why not?
[03:52:51] <BojanBG> dov_rine, I need to select children from variable
[03:52:56] <BojanBG> recursively
[03:53:06] <BojanBG> they just explain how to do it in CSS
[03:53:23] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: that's exactly what this is.  one sec.  i'll give you the cliff's notes
[03:53:30] <BojanBG> which I knew already
[03:54:51] <antnash_> Am I right in thinking that the following should fade #uploadwrapper in/out on alternate clicks?
[03:55:20] <antnash_> $('#actUpload').toggle(function() {	 $('uploadwrapper').fadeIn('750');	}, function() {$('uploadwrapper').fadeOut('750');});
[03:56:30] <BojanBG> dov_Rine i fixed it by just giving the id to the elements im selecting and extracting that ID and parsing it again with css with $('#div .children');
[03:56:40] <BojanBG> dov_rine, too much time wasted on a stupid thing :)
[03:57:11] <BojanBG> dov_rine, off to take a shower, thank you for the help
[03:57:19] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: in the absolute worst case scenario, you can deconstruct the variable
[03:57:33] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG:  like this: var children = $('#' + div1.attr('id') + ' *');
[03:57:46] <BojanBG> dov_rine, just what I did
[03:57:56] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: then you can use .find() or .filter() to get just the children
[03:58:40] <BojanBG> dov_Rine, yep done in that way :D
[03:58:56] <BojanBG> dov_rine, too much time wasted on a stupid thing :), thank you again for help
[03:59:38] <Dov_Rine> BojanBG: you're welcome.  This is working for me: var children = $('#' + div1.attr('id') + ' *').filter('.children');
[04:03:59] <Aha2Y> The jQuery example simply does not work, http://hackz.ch/twitter/index.php <- Simple twitter example from jsfiddle.
[04:06:32] <D4> /who Aha2y
[04:06:48] <D4> is a good Q - what is that?
[04:07:28] <D4> I'm not allowed in on that page, sorry.
[04:07:38] <Aha2Y> huh?
[04:08:04] <Aha2Y> Yes, its a white page :<
[04:08:12] <Aha2Y> but its suposed to give twitter
[04:08:23] <Dov_Rine> Aha2Y: it looks like you are probably missing a library
[04:08:28] <Cork> Aha2Y: 1. you need to include the lib that defined tweets
[04:08:42] <Cork> set a doctype
[04:08:48] <Cork> *2.
[04:08:59] <Dov_Rine> Aha2Y: yes, that too
[04:11:25] <Dov_Rine> Aha2Y: here's the missing library:  http://github.com/kerberoS/jQuery-Tweets/raw/master/js/jquery.tweets.0.1.js
[04:11:26] <Aha2Y> I have now
[04:11:31] <Aha2Y> Still white oh
[04:12:26] <Dov_Rine> Aha2Y: you have 2 head tags now
[04:12:32] <Aha2Y> works now :)
[04:13:17] <Dov_Rine> Aha2Y: gl
[04:13:40] <Aha2Y> Why does jsfiddle not tell that you need that libary...
[04:14:38] <Dov_Rine> Aha2Y: as a matter of fact, it looks like they went out of their way to make it more difficult to look at the source code for the example.  I don't know why they did it.
[04:17:09] <Carlitta87> hey guys. im kinda frustrated by this but in IE my jcarousel crashes. ive been looking at it for 2 days now. i dont no wat to do....i wud truly appreciate your help figuring out what the problem could be. http://demo.devmediastudios.com/cbjamaica/index.php
[04:20:00] <Dov_Rine> Carlitta87: it looks like your page is in quirks mode
[04:20:12] <Zogot> Carlitta87: remove the script before the doctype dec
[04:21:17] <aitiba> hi
[04:21:27] <aitiba> some one that ever used uploadify can help me please?
[04:21:29] <Carlitta87> zogot ,  when i remove that from the top i get more errors lol
[04:22:24] <shoky`> Whirl3d: sups
[04:22:30] <Carlitta87> Dov_Rine : i thought quirks mode is only set by  the browser
[04:23:16] <Dov_Rine> Carlitta87: it is.  that's how IE is rendering it for me.
[04:25:59] <ravenzz> Carlitta87 he meant, move that script at the bottom of the <body>
[04:27:50] <Carlitta87> ok one sec
[04:27:59] <webresour> Hello.
[04:28:05] <ravenzz> hello
[04:28:10] <xec_> hello
[04:28:11] <webresour> Is there anybody who can help me with that : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10700156/javascript-inline-variables-used-by-external-javascript-file-variable-scope-is
[04:28:12] <webresour> ?
[04:28:18] <Dov_Rine> Carlitta87: the script at the top of your page is also missing a type declaration
[04:28:59] <webresour> This is a variable scope issue with jQuery(document).ready(.......
[04:29:47] <shoky`> HELO
[04:30:22] <Dov_Rine> Carlitta87: why can't that function be in the head of the page?
[04:30:30] <xec_> webresour: is your code live somewhere?
[04:30:33] <ravenzz> webresour do you experience that issue only within the ready callback?
[04:30:53] <webresour> yes
[04:31:18] <xec_> webresour: a global var should be available anywhere unless you overwrite it. do you have the same issue if you name it something else?
[04:31:20] <ravenzz> what question did you answered
[04:31:21] <ravenzz> ?
[04:31:26] <Carlitta87> Dov_Rine : gonna change it now but my application froze :/. sry give me a sec plz
[04:31:30] <webresour> if I try console.dir(gettype ops); before the document ready I get as a result "Object"
[04:31:38] <Dov_Rine> Carlitta87: np, take your time
[04:31:39] <xec_> "gettype"?
[04:31:45] <shoky`> webresour: we need to see a demo, or a full paste of your code
[04:32:05] <webresour> sory no gettype, this is PHP xaxaxa
[04:32:08] <webresour> I use typeof
[04:32:30] <webresour> xec_: yes I have the same issue with other name of that same object
[04:33:10] <webresour> is there anything wrong with that ?
[04:33:31] <xec_> 10 bucks says there is something else going wrong
[04:34:00] <shoky`> 20 here
[04:34:17] <shoky`> do you call
[04:34:18] <Dov_Rine> webresour: it shouldn't matter, but you can try defining ops as window.ops
[04:34:48] <Dov_Rine> webresour: or calling it as window.ops
[04:35:01] <xec_> webresour: http://jsfiddle.net/WNFyu/
[04:35:30] <xec_> webresour: that's a demo doing basically exactly the same as your question states, without issue...
[04:36:23] <xec_> well, i did .log() instead of .dir() by mistake, but you get my point ;)
[04:36:27] <Dov_Rine> webresour: you are trying to use ops inside the included js.js file, right?
[04:36:31] <antnash_> Alright guys. I'm using a file input with multiple set, and when I console.log(input.val()) it only shows 1 of the file names. How do I get both?
[04:37:54] <Dov_Rine> antnash_: look at console.log(input) and you should be able to find where it
[04:38:10] <antnash_> ah, cheers dude
[04:38:13] <Dov_Rine> antnash_: * it's storing the filenames
[04:38:15] <ravenzz> console.debug
[04:39:53] <antnash_> Dov_Rine, ravenzz, Nope. It just echoes out the element with params. Nothing more
[04:41:26] <xec_> shoky`: i see what you did there, albeit a bit late. i call your bluff, although that doesn't make any sense at all
[04:41:38] <Dov_Rine> antnash_: I assume that you are using straight html with multple, right?
[04:42:05] <antnash_> Dov_Rine: yup. Just that and jquery, then gonna send them to php
[04:42:59] <Dov_Rine> antnash_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6171013/javascript-get-number-of-files-and-their-filenames-from-input-multiple-elemen
[04:44:26] <antnash_> Cheers dude. I just stumbled upon the same
[04:44:42] <Dov_Rine> antnash_: it's not jquery yet, that's up to you ;)
[04:44:56] <antnash_> Yeah, that's simple enough
[04:46:56] <Eshu> how to scroll div with different div scroll
[04:46:58] <Eshu> ?
[04:47:13] <xec_> lol what
[04:47:32] <Eshu> i just want to create a schedule like daypilot
[04:47:38] <Dov_Rine> Carlitta87: I may not be able to reply to you again in a little while, so I just wanted to suggest that you try to validate your pages, especially when you are trying to get them to work in IE.  It will be a pain in the beginning, but you will learn a lot and your sites will be easier to maintain and less likely to break.
[04:47:58] <Eshu> ????
[04:48:08] <antnash_> Rov_Rine: Right, pretty sure that doesn't work. property files is not defined...
[04:48:20] <stenno|work> too much question marks...
[04:48:23] <xec_> Eshu: if you want a scrollable div, just do overflow: auto; in css?
[04:48:58] <Dov_Rine> antnash_: that response is talking about doctype html5.  I'll look for something else.  give me a sec.
[04:48:58] <Carlitta87> Dov_Rine : ok...ive been uploading several edited versions but the come out the same ... ill keep looking
[04:49:08] <Eshu> the want to scroll the 2nd div when scroll the 1st div
[04:49:34] <antnash_> Dov_Rine: I'm using chrome, and have had other html5 stuff working fine. I checked that
[04:49:41] <xec_> ?demo @ Eshu
[04:49:42] <bot-t> Eshu, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:50:07] <Eshu> Okey
[04:50:22] <xec_> Eshu: we're not going to write you a script, but are more than willing to help if you have trouble. start with showing us what you got so far
[04:50:32] <antnash_> Yeah, I got html5 doctype set
[04:50:33] <Dov_Rine> afk
[04:51:08] <crescent_sun> what is the ready handler in jquery.  and what does it do?
[04:51:15] <xec_> Eshu: also, assume we have no idea what "daypilot" is ;)
[04:51:32] <Cork> crescent_sun: its a compatibility event wrapper jquery creates
[04:51:48] <stenno|work> Eshu, also it makes people (like me) angry if you abuse punctuation marks like this
[04:51:56] <xdxd> Yo guys ... can anyone help me make a comet ?
[04:52:05] <xec_> stenno|work: why????
[04:52:08] <Cork> crescent_sun: it tries to use DOMContentLoaded if it exists else it falls back to onload (ie)
[04:52:20] <stenno|work> xec_, its rather irritating, isn't it ?!?!?!?!?
[04:52:22] <stenno|work> :)
[04:52:24] <xec_> hehe
[04:52:52] <Cork> crescent_sun: domcontentloaded is triggerd when the html document has been parsed completly, but before its rendered and before images has been loaded completly
[04:54:08] <Eshu> xec_ ?
[04:54:19] <crescent_sun> Cork: thanks that last part helped a lot
[04:54:51] <Cork> ?mdc domcontentloaded

[05:04:21] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: same name.  np
[05:04:57] <Eshu> Dove_Rine Can you tell how to move div through jquery same like when we scroll the div
[05:05:26] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: i need to finish a phone call first
[05:05:33] <diverdude> stenno|work: hey again...do ou have any idea how i would be able to activate the modalbox with a click instead of having it pop up at page load?
[05:05:37] <Eshu> okey waiting
[05:05:45] <Eshu> np Dov_rine
[05:07:35] <Xotix> i'm having the problem (in chrome) that a file input doesn't allow to upload the same file twice after each other. So if i upload foo.jpg i can't upload it again unless i choose some different file. Then i can upload it again
[05:09:44] <Xotix> Seems like it doesn't trigger the change. can i somehow resete it?
[05:10:24] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: ok, what was your question for me?
[05:10:44] <Cork> Xotix: your doing ajax upload?
[05:10:46] <pachet> Xotix: yeah i dont think the value changes in chrome if the file path is the same
[05:10:52] <blqwifqwhflahf> Hi. How can I look for a specific text string inside a specific DIV and remove that specific text string?

[05:11:06] <blqwifqwhflahf> :/
[05:11:14] <Eshu> i just want scroll a div through jquery
[05:11:22] <Eshu> not from the scroll bar
[05:11:35] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: ok, give me a sec
[05:11:39] <Eshu> okey
[05:11:41] <Xotix> Cork yes. I'm using forms.jquery.js the only solution which i could think of is having a second hidden form and move the input to it. So it is always a new form and so it is some kind of reseted….
[05:11:42] <Eshu> waiting
[05:12:05] <Cork> Xotix: js could "save" the old File object and reuse that
[05:12:17] <diverdude> stenno|work: i managed to invoke it on click...but it appears on page load still for some reason :(
[05:12:37] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: are you talking about scrolling to a specific point or just scrolling it up or down continuously?
[05:12:39] <Xotix> Cork hm? I'm submiting the form on change() of the file input.
[05:12:41] <Cork> Xotix: would prob be the cleanest way to do it, though might be a bit tough with the lib
[05:12:46] <pachet> blqwifqwhflahf: you know the id for your div?
[05:12:51] <blqwifqwhflahf> yes
[05:12:53] <blqwifqwhflahf> very much so
[05:13:04] <blqwifqwhflahf> I need to remove a word from insidei t
[05:13:37] <pachet> var my_div = $('#foo'); my_div.html(my_div.html().replace('pikachu', 'raichu'))
[05:13:52] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: have a look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3432656/scroll-to-a-div-using-jquery
[05:14:04] <Eshu> Dov_Rine Wait
[05:14:14] <Eshu> let me see that thread
[05:14:25] <blqwifqwhflahf> You're a gamer eh?
[05:15:20] <Dov_Rine> blqwifqwhflahf: you can get the string with something like var myText=$('#div').html()
[05:15:43] <blqwifqwhflahf> YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[05:15:44] <blqwifqwhflahf> Finally
[05:15:50] <blqwifqwhflahf> This has been annoying me for an hour
[05:15:56] <blqwifqwhflahf> Cheers pachet
[05:15:58] <blqwifqwhflahf> You're the man.
[05:16:06] <pachet> blqwifqwhflahf: yw :D
[05:16:11] <blqwifqwhflahf> And maybe Dov_Rine had you been faster. ;P
[05:16:18] <Dov_Rine> blqwifqwhflahf: then you can do something like myText.replace('text to replace', '')
[05:16:31] <blqwifqwhflahf> Alright. I'll remember that for next time.
[05:17:10] <Dov_Rine> blqwifqwhflahf: actually, it will be $('#div').html(myText.replace('text to replace', ''))
[05:18:12] <blqwifqwhflahf> Alright.
[05:18:14] <blqwifqwhflahf> :)
[05:18:44] <Eshu> Dov_Rine Done
[05:18:47] <Eshu> thnx
[05:18:52] <Eshu> it's work
[05:18:59] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: you're welcome
[05:19:07] <Eshu> Dov_Rine one more question
[05:19:25] <Eshu> i have a two div
[05:19:35] <pachet> Dov_Rine: better to store a reference to that jq obj, than to call $('#div') twice ;o
[05:20:05] <Libin> hello..i have got a javascript fuction which sends data to the server..it does that ok. but after executing that code in server focus comesback to javascript.. how can i avoid that
[05:20:10] <Dov_Rine> pachet: you are, of course, correct.
[05:20:35] <pachet> focus comes back to javascript...what?
[05:20:40] <Famic> anyone can recommend a good custo scrollbar plugin ?
[05:20:51] <Famic> +m
[05:21:08] <Libin> pachet: yes
[05:21:13] <Eshu> outer div width is 300px and inner div width is 1000px... But the i want to show the inner div content in outer div and the remianing div data not want to show any idea
[05:21:14] <Dov_Rine> Libin: I assume that you are talking about an ajax request.  you can't avoid the function finishing.
[05:21:24] <Libin> yes
[05:21:39] <Eshu> Dov_Rine One more Query
[05:21:51] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: the outer/inner div, right?
[05:21:58] <Eshu> yes
[05:22:25] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: you are trying to mask the wider inner div with the outer div?
[05:22:39] <Eshu> yes you are right
[05:22:49] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: do you need to use jquery to do it?
[05:22:51] <Libin> Dov: But then rather than rendering the new page, it comes back to this ajax function.. how can i deal with this.. any hin
[05:22:54] <Libin> hint*
[05:23:08] <pachet> oh
[05:23:14] <Dov_Rine> Libin: don't use an ajax function if you want to load a new page
[05:23:19] <Eshu> when i will scroll the outer through jquery i will scroll the same inner div and the content will visible in outer div
[05:23:37] <Libin> ohhh.. thanks
[05:24:17] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: I think your solution is css.  overflow-x:hidden
[05:26:00] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: you may need a little bit more css to force the inner div to really be inside.  if you are doing it with jquery, you can do something like: $('#outerDiv').css('overflow-x', 'hidden');
[05:26:42] <Libin> so is there any other way i can post json data to the server.. i mean avoiding ajax request
[05:27:01] <Dov_Rine> Libin: in a form
[05:27:14] <Eshu> Okey Dov_Rine let me implement that
[05:27:41] <Kingsy> anyone aware of a image slider that uses a loader? so larger images can be used?
[05:27:51] <Kingsy> by larger I mean in file size :)
[05:28:42] <saim> hi
[05:29:00] <stenno|work> hi
[05:29:08] <Dov_Rine> Libin: you can also force a redirect after the successful ajax call using window.location="new url"
[05:29:48] <Dov_Rine> Libin: I don't like that solution much, though.  I'm not sure why.  It just doesn't 'feel right' to me.
[05:30:13] <pachet> i'll tell you why it doesnt feel right
[05:30:20] <pachet> because it requires two requests to complete :[
[05:30:27] <pachet> one for the submission, and another for the redirect
[05:31:41] <Dov_Rine> pachet: good observation
[05:32:11] <pachet> wasteful unless you need do some error checking or cleanup or what have you
[05:32:17] <pachet> something tells me Libin doesn't
[05:32:33] <Eshu> Dov_Rine
[05:32:37] <Eshu> you there
[05:32:38] <Dov_Rine> pachet: something tells me that he probably does ;)
[05:32:41] <Eshu> http://jsfiddle.net/rkumar670/yGk2E/8/
[05:32:47] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: i'm here
[05:32:58] <Eshu> unable to do that
[05:32:59] <Eshu> ??
[05:33:15] <Eshu> can you look into the link
[05:33:23] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: ok
[05:34:35] <pachet> not look at the link....look INTO it
[05:34:53] <pachet> peer into the void that is unresolved hyperlink
[05:35:18] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: you got it backward
[05:35:52] <stenno|work> drawkcab ti tog uoy
[05:35:54] <Eshu> yes
[05:36:00] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: you put the overflow-x on the inner div
[05:36:12] <stenno|work> i love my qualified statements which enrich the discussion
[05:36:42] <Eshu> yes i put in inner div
[05:36:52] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: that's why it didn't work
[05:37:10] <Eshu> then i have to put that in outer one
[05:37:17] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: you are hiding the overflow on the outer div, right?
[05:37:53] <Eshu> Dov_Rine: yes
[05:38:17] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: so how would hiding the inner div's overflow help?
[05:38:28] <Eshu> Thnx Dude
[05:38:32] <Eshu> it's Work
[05:38:42] <Eshu> after putting in the Outer Div
[05:38:51] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: when you get the chance, you should look at some of the css tutorials out there
[05:38:53] <Eshu> Thnx Again Dov_Rine
[05:38:56] <Dov_Rine> Eshu: np
[05:39:19] <Eshu> Can i have your Email Plz
[05:39:23] <diverdude> stenno|work: this modal is really weird
[05:39:31] <Eshu> so we can commnicate further

[05:42:45] <Famic> anyone can recommend a good custom scrollbar plugin ?
[05:42:56] <stenno|work> twitter bootstrap
[05:44:37] <Famic> stenno|work: are you sure it does scrollbars ?
[05:44:39] <donnaR> hey is it possible or some kind of hackish way to make a cross-domain request to retrieve some html?
[05:46:03] <pachet> donnaR: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/cross-domain-requests-with-jquery/
[05:46:30] <donnaR> pachet, i was trying that all day long
[05:46:35] <antnash_> I've been searching, but seem to be drawing a blank. All I want to do is remove, say, the element at index 4 from an array. Can't find it at all
[05:47:07] <donnaR> pachet, seems like they've patched it or something
[05:48:15] <Dov_Rine> antnash_: are you looking at a javascript array?
[05:48:46] <antnash_> Dov_Rine: Yeah. Well it's a filelist
[05:49:22] <Dov_Rine> antnash_: arr.splice():  look here: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp
[05:49:25] <pachet> ?eval var foo=[1,2,3,4,5]; foo.splice(4,1); foo
[05:49:28] <bot-t> pachet: [1, 2, 3, 4]
[05:49:34] <pachet> antash_^
[05:49:44] <antnash_> cheers guys
[05:57:41] <diverdude> I am trying to get the modalbox from twitter bootstrap to work ( http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals ). I have this code: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1485728112 but for some reason when the page loads the box is shown. How can i avoid that so that only when i click the link the box is shown?
[05:57:44] <ravenzz> donnaR do you have any control over the target server?
[05:57:57] <donnaR> ravenzz, nope
[05:59:13] <ravenzz> if the plugin that pachet links doens't work, you should have some server side proxy that will do the request for you
[05:59:26] <Richi83> Hi I am wondering if anyone here might be able to answer a question I have relating to an issue I'm having using the jquery-ui plugin.
[06:00:11] * geekbuntu only if the issue of that of the relevance of the relating issue therein afterwards referred to as the problem thereof
[06:00:26] <Richi83> lol :)
[06:00:48] <donnaR> ravenzz, well then it wouldnt be called exactly cross-domain, thats why i asked if there was a hackish way
[06:00:51] <pachet> providing better internet service than your current internet providing service provider
[06:02:52] <Richi83> I seem to be having an issue when using the jquery-ui I have it contained within a div, and above that some more div's, now as soon as I try using float with the div's above the one containing jquery-ui for tab's It seems to overlay ontop of the previous div's. I really can't find a way to fix it. I can provide link / picture to anyone willing to have a go at helping.
[06:04:26] <geekbuntu> Richi83, if you can make a workup in fiddle.net - just post here, people will look at some point today, but it almost seems like a css problem(?) - so be clear on fiddle :)
[06:06:05] <Richi83> well I thought it might of been a css issue, I am relatively new to developing. but I've tried many things. It just appears that the jquery-ui doesn't give a crap about the actual container div, and instead makes it self position wise relative to body regardless :\ I'll have a look a fiddle.net now :) thank you for the reply.
[06:09:38] <Richi83> Ok I must be missing something geekbuntu, fiddle.net is for musical insturuments. Could you be more specific to where you want this work up? sorry if it seems newbish question.
[06:10:06] <azk> Richi83: jsfiddle.net is what he meant
[06:10:20] <Richi83> ahh ok thats better :D
[06:10:26] <Richi83> many tahnks
[06:10:48] <azk> np
[06:10:57] <geekbuntu> azk, ...yeah, that's it o.0
[06:15:08] <pachet> please make a handcrafted violin that demonstrates your problem
[06:15:32] <poppiez> does anyone know why this isn't working in chrome? http://jdsharp.us/jQuery/minute/calculate-scrollbar-width.php gives me the same width
[06:16:55] <Famic> seriously is there any decent custom scrollbar out there ?
[06:18:34] <Famic> looks like one of those "should be easy be doesn't exist" things :(
[06:19:08] <ndugu> how do you center full sized images with jquery cycle and make them fade when you click on them?
[06:19:15] <ndugu> i need the code
[06:19:28] <pachet> poppiez: same width? i'm getting 0 in my chrome, because the scrollbar is overlaid, hence doesnt change elem width
[06:20:59] <pachet> bot-t should have a trigger to randomly pull a line from wat.json
[06:21:24] <thomaslfromz> hello
[06:22:10] <thomaslfromz> beginners question, I want to run a function  on $("#edit-field").is(":checked")
[06:22:21] <thomaslfromz> I cant get the syntax right
[06:22:39] <pachet> you want to fire a callback when the checkbox becomes checked?
[06:22:54] <thomaslfromz> a function
[06:23:04] <pachet> potato, potato
[06:23:04] <thomaslfromz> which selects all my checkboxes
[06:23:28] <thomaslfromz> do you like potato? ;-)
[06:23:33] <xdxd> how i can update my chat with this ?  http://pastebin.com/CxMeFiQY im using foreach loop to get my messages.
[06:23:36] <pachet> $(':checkbox').prop('checked', true)
[06:23:44] <Zhy> callbacks are functions,  that's what he means ;)
[06:23:56] <DeltaHeavy> If I had a variable that was lets say y[0]=1, and I had the following line, how would I pass y[0]? It's coming out as undefined so I assume it's not being passed through the post AJAX function: $.post("ajax.php", { item: y[1] }, function(response) {add_item_menu(JSON.parse(response, y[0]));});
[06:23:58] <thomaslfromz> ;-)
[06:24:04] <poppiez> pachet: found another fn. http://visualpulse.net/forums/index.php?topic=120.0
[06:24:06] <poppiez> that one works :)
[06:24:58] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: unless the server you're posting to builds that JSON object in the response, it will be undefined
[06:25:14] <DeltaHeavy> Oh crap I'm dumb thanks
[06:25:14] <pachet> that doesnt mean that its undefined in the request body though
[06:25:22] <thomaslfromz> take a look http://jsfiddle.net/XMw7s/
[06:25:34] <thomaslfromz> sorry, I'm a total beginner/noob
[06:25:49] <DeltaHeavy> Works, got it
[06:27:11] <thomaslfromz> whats prop() ?
[06:27:43] <skylamer`> property, attribute
[06:28:06] <pachet> ?prop
[06:28:07] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[06:28:30] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/huWqz/
[06:28:34] <pachet> thomaslfromz^
[06:28:37] <specijalac> ?next
[06:28:37] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[06:28:46] <specijalac> ?attr
[06:28:46] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[06:29:08] <specijalac> guys, what's the difference between .attr and .prop? I've never figure this out?
[06:29:32] <pachet> attributes are the element's inline attributes
[06:29:44] <pachet> properties are javascript properties on the dom element reference
[06:30:15] <specijalac> any DOM element?
[06:30:18] <pachet> when the dom is built, dom elem references are assigned properties correlative to their attributes
[06:30:20] <specijalac> or property?
[06:30:31] <specijalac> like .prop('innerHTML')
[06:30:32] <specijalac> ?
[06:31:29] <pachet> er yeah, that *would* work, but
[06:31:32] <pachet> :[
[06:32:05] <pachet> being that this is #jquery, .html() is much more convenient
[06:32:22] <specijalac> :) you've clearified my .prop :) thank you
[06:32:31] <specijalac> me *
[06:32:47] <specijalac> I tought it was just an alias to .attr
[06:36:57] <thomaslfromz> pachet: Why do you write var $el = and not just var el =  in http://jsfiddle.net/huWqz/
[06:37:19] <pachet> its just a semi-accepted way of denoting that the variable references a jquery object
[06:37:31] <pachet> you don't have to use it, by any means
[06:37:44] <thomaslfromz> sou just your style
[06:37:48] <aaaa> khbjh
[06:37:55] <pachet> mine, and others like me :[
[06:38:40] <Guest41771> any one
[06:40:13] <diverdude> Is it possible to make the twitter bootstrap carousel display true image sizes instead of scaling down?
[06:41:01] <specijalac> is there a plugin there witch shortcuts the document.createElement(elementName); ?
[06:41:29] <specijalac> like.. $( $.create('div', { id: "myId", class: "etc etc2" }) ); ?
[06:42:17] <smplstk> $( '<div id="myId" class="etc etc2">' ).appendTo( 'body' );
[06:42:57] <specijalac> didn't know that that kind of pattern could work! :) thanks smplstk
[06:43:14] <xdxd> http://pastebin.com/3mTVxAGR     how i can update now my foreach loop where i update the messages ?
[06:43:50] <smplstk> specijalac: or: $( '<div>' ).attr( { id: 'myId', class: 'etc etc2' } ).appendTo( 'body' );​
[06:43:54] <pachet> $('<div/>', {id:'foo', class:'bar'})
[06:43:58] <pachet> ah, beat me to it
[06:44:04] <smplstk> yes, or that.
[06:44:19] <specijalac> kick ass!
[06:44:22] <specijalac> thanks guys!
[06:45:37] <m4xx> any jstree users in the house?
[06:46:12] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: once upon a time.  haven't touched it in a while, though.
[06:47:19] <specijalac> guys, this is not an advertisement on my website
[06:47:29] <specijalac> but I need your pro oppinion on my antispam check:
[06:47:33] <specijalac> www.omerbase.com
[06:47:42] <specijalac> what do you think of it? is it bot-breakable?
[06:47:51] <Dov_Rine> specijalac: you want us to try to spam it?
[06:48:00] <Dov_Rine> specijalac: just kidding ;)
[06:48:02] <m4xx> lulz
[06:48:09] <xdxd> how i can use this  http://pastebin.com/3mTVxAGR .... fk
[06:48:32] <specijalac> well you can trigger a click event on that button :)
[06:48:40] <specijalac> via console, I think :)
[06:49:47] <m4xx> i've got a dynamic jstree using "ajax"  for the json data. when i expand a node i only return the directory list so i can query for the file list separately as in my application there could be a boat load of files in a directory. i'de like use the after_load or similar to load the files once the directory list has been received
[06:50:11] <pachet> xdxd: you have some learning to do, grasshopper
[06:50:19] <pachet> ?ajax
[06:50:19] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:50:44] <pachet> also i suspect a foundational understanding of javascript wouldn't hurt
[06:50:52] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: why can't you define the after_load event in the docready?
[06:51:20] <m4xx> my problem is, how do i get the ide of the loaded node
[06:51:31] <m4xx> *id
[06:51:38] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: ok, one sec
[06:52:00] <m4xx> or even a metadata value
[06:53:03] <specijalac> so
[06:53:12] <specijalac> about the URL pattern about my request..
[06:53:22] <specijalac> could I do something like
[06:53:39] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: This worked for me back in the day: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6702313/how-to-make-json-ajax-call-in-jstree
[06:53:52] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: I still had the bookmark ;)
[06:54:05] <specijalac> '/<id:\d+>' => '/main/browse/'
[06:54:06] <specijalac> ?
[06:54:26] <specijalac> oh, sorry, wrong room!
[06:54:30] <pachet> lol
[06:54:43] <pachet> was about so say, fee fi fo fum, i spell php
[06:54:48] <stenno|work> what kind of syntax is that
[06:55:21] <specijalac> an associative array pattern in PHP :D
[06:55:25] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: thanks for the link but i've already got it loading the directory structure.
[06:55:30] <xdxd> pachet please can you help me how to combine the ajax with my foreach look at this please ... http://pastebin.com/aY6bkiqv
[06:55:34] <shoky`> specijalac: i did $('#antispam').trigger('click')  and it validated...
[06:55:49] <specijalac> yes.. I know that works :)
[06:55:49] <Dov_Rine> stenno|work: looks like a weird array of regex keys
[06:55:58] <shoky`> so how is that antispam :s
[06:55:59] <specijalac> could a BOT execute that kind of a javascript?
[06:56:09] <stenno|work> Dov_Rine, well then the syntax is buggy
[06:56:13] <shoky`> why wouldn't it
[06:56:24] <stenno|work> Dov_Rine, because the closing '/' is missing
[06:56:52] <Dov_Rine> stenno|work: I know.  that's one of the reasons I said 'weird'.
[06:57:11] <stenno|work> fair :)
[06:57:15] <stenno|work> also, php D:::
[06:57:19] <pachet> xdxd: you should ask in ##php, ( but what you want is to call 'ob_start()' before your loop, then 'echo(json_encode(array('contents'=>ob_get_clean())));' after it )
[06:57:44] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: if you already loaded the node, then you have the id, don't you?
[06:58:53] <Lucky--> Poll/question: If every form submit that occurs you get $140, would you trust jquery to submit it via ajax?
[06:58:59] <shoky`> specijalac: a bot could do anything a human could do, with regards to clicking & interacting with your site
[06:59:09] <xdxd> pachet so i need only <body ob_start()> and my echo in the loop make to json_encode(my text from db) ?
[06:59:12] <m4xx> http://paste2.org/p/2031661
[06:59:15] <pachet> Lucky--: you mean, every form submit that occurs correctly? :[
[06:59:19] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: -^
[06:59:19] <Lucky--> yes
[06:59:20] <Stew-a> is flXHR still the best way to do reliable cross-domain POST ajax requests? only firefox and chrome seem to support CORS
[06:59:24] <pachet> xdxd: no bro
[06:59:28] <pachet> xdxd: go learn php
[06:59:33] <Lucky--> eek php sucks
[06:59:42] <specijalac> why php sucks?
[06:59:44] <Lucky--> javascript is more capable then php
[06:59:44] <Lucky--> lol
[06:59:51] <stenno|work> javascript ftw
[06:59:53] <m4xx> em
[06:59:57] <xdxd> pachet im not bad at php its just the javascript i can,t get in .. you know my php working good .
[06:59:57] <Lucky--> try threading in php.
[07:00:12] <Lucky--> try multi anything in php. true OOP? whats that.
[07:00:21] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: in the after_open callback i'de like to retrieve the the actual file list, once i've loaded my directory list
[07:00:22] <pachet> xdxd: if you think that you'd ever put ob_start() in a literal, you have more learning to do
[07:00:29] <Jon47> Lucky— facebook has managed to do some pretty great things with php
[07:00:30] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: i'm going to try to find the code in my old project.
[07:00:34] <pachet> Lucky--: threading is possible
[07:00:38] <pachet> just not out of the box :[
[07:00:47] <Lucky--> Jon47: you mean "php" its really ajax, hell they've written php compilers
[07:00:49] <pachet> that said, fuck php
[07:00:53] <xdxd> pachat ah okey its an php function
[07:00:59] <Lucky--> to convert it to executable runtimes
[07:01:04] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: mine didn't use files, but it did use recursive ajax calls
[07:01:09] <Lucky--> they have half rewritten evrything they use
[07:01:10] <stenno|work> Lucky--, concerning php "OOP": http://phpsadness.com/sad/23
[07:01:24] <pachet> groan, i apologize for setting us down this path
[07:01:27] <stenno|work> the only really true OOP i have seen so far is JS
[07:01:28] <pachet> can we get back on topic :[
[07:01:42] <stenno|work> more OOP than ruby
[07:01:48] <Lucky--> http://royal.pingdom.com/2010/06/18/the-software-behind-facebook/ <-- i would call that a "resemblence" to php
[07:02:31] <Lucky--> i started in php, attempted true threading (not posix/fork() bs) and scrapped 10k lines of code, learned c# and rewrote it in 1/5 that with 2x the functionality, and a healthy knowledge of writing web services, rest apis, web apps, etc, etc
[07:02:44] <Lucky--> oh and 10x the job opportunities
[07:03:02] <Lucky--> i actually just deleted all my client form php and converted it ALL to ajax
[07:03:09] <xdxd> dad
[07:03:40] <pachet> no, your dad's not here
[07:03:41] <Lucky--> only php I have left: http://pastebin.com/ExigVWPw
[07:03:44] <pachet> he might be in ##php though
[07:04:05] <shoky`> i wanna meet that dad
[07:04:16] <Jon47> now tell me boutcha dad
[07:04:36] <xdxd> pachet and the javascript will help me how ?
[07:04:45] <stenno|work> i would beat my dead if he was in ##php
[07:04:51] <stenno|work> with a pointed stick
[07:04:52] <pachet> xdxd: dont even know what that means
[07:05:03] <Lucky--> http://autoleadnow.cloudapp.net:8080/ALNWebServices.service/_help <-- have fun writing that in PHP. without the methods, its like 10 lines of code
[07:05:12] <pachet> stenno|work: beat your dead!
[07:05:14] <xdxd> pachet i found this http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery
[07:05:36] <xdxd> pachet so how will works the javascript .
[07:05:53] <Lucky--> xdxd: check out web sockets
[07:05:54] <Lucky--> for that
[07:06:03] <pachet> xdxd: nothing's going to work until you take it upon yourself to learn the basics
[07:06:15] <pachet> until you do that, everything you touch will turn to shit
[07:06:16] <Lucky--> patchet: whats he trying to do? async progress bar?
[07:06:26] <pachet> Lucky--: chat client
[07:06:36] <Lucky--> xdxd: language?
[07:06:40] <xdxd> Lucky-- php
[07:06:45] <Lucky--> BAHAHAHHAHAHA
[07:06:54] <pachet> yeah
[07:06:56] <Lucky--> good luck.
[07:07:12] <pachet> php polling for chat is so 2002 :[
[07:07:14] <Lucky--> xdxd: a subscriber model is what you need to do
[07:07:45] <Lucky--> a real language, and a chat client in 12 lines of code: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AsynchronousScalableWebApplicationsWithRealtimePersistentLongrunningConnectionsWithSignalR.aspx
[07:07:51] <D4> Hm, anyone else had issues with .mouseout() in gecko?
[07:07:54] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: sorry, i don't have the old project files on my laptop here
[07:08:10] <m4xx> why is bashing php the new fad?
[07:08:10] <pachet> longest url in mankind's history
[07:08:19] <xdxd> Lucky-- subscriber model ?  , have you not any easy php polling system ? ...
[07:08:40] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: it's cool =] i shall continue my quest
[07:08:48] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: I'll see if I can come up with something for you anyway.  are you using json?
[07:08:51] <Lucky--> xdxd: php is useless and extremely extremely difficult for what you are trying to do. php doesnt keep the connection open
[07:08:53] <pachet> yeah Lucky--, where do you keep the easy php stuff! i know you're hoarding it
[07:08:54] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: thank you very much for looking
[07:08:56] <shoky`> i'd send him links
[07:09:00] <m4xx> yes sir
[07:09:12] <stenno|work> talking about php in #jquery ... o tempora o mores
[07:09:30] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: if you haven't seen my pastebin paste http://paste2.org/p/2031661
[07:09:38] <m4xx> if it gives you any kind of a jumpstart
[07:09:43] <Lucky--> xdxd: in php more or less the only thing that you would accomplish would be almost a resource intensive "web bbs"
[07:09:48] <Lucky--> a glorified bbs lol
[07:09:49] <xdxd> Lucky-- hmmm im using php to store the messages in db ... and then output... idk i have think js just help to update it to php ...
[07:09:54] <pachet> stenno|work: caveat auditor :[
[07:10:19] <Lucky--> xdxd: a chat service should monitor the clients and maintain connection
[07:10:29] <Lucky--> xdxd: php will connect, and disconnect
[07:10:48] <Lucky--> each client needs to have a connection to the server
[07:10:55] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: there's a function called .load_node_json in the docs.  It has its own callbacks for success and error.  This looks like it might be better suited to what you are trying to do.  The page I'm looking at is here:  http://www.jstree.com/documentation/json_data#
[07:11:10] <xdxd> Lucky-- hmm so i dont need a database for a chat ? just javascript or jquery?
[07:11:19] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: I hadn't seen your pastebin.  I'll check it out now.
[07:11:21] <Lucky--> xdxd: not necessarily.
[07:11:33] <Lucky--> you still need a server to handle it, but you dont need to insert to the db
[07:11:47] <Lucky--> client -> msg -> server -> broadcast to clients connected
[07:11:52] <Lucky--> have FUN doing that in php
[07:12:02] * Lucky-- runs away in fear from that task
[07:12:04] <pachet> pretty easy to just add a db pusher as a subscriber
[07:12:20] <xdxd> Lucky-- you are still here?
[07:12:29] <Lucky--> lol.
[07:12:32] <xdxd> _:D
[07:12:51] <xdxd> lucky-- okey .. so is there any easy step by step chat turoial ? like for me ? :D
[07:13:05] <xdxd> lucky--  i mean do you know some good websites for this ?
[07:13:13] <Lucky--> https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/tutorials/app-using-socketio/
[07:13:47] <pachet> xdxd: seriously, learn the languages man
[07:13:50] <pachet> this isnt wifflebat baseball
[07:14:14] <Lucky--> http://jabbr.net/ <-- 12 line chat room

[07:15:48] <bjesus> can someone help me splitting a string into words without breaking html? like "hey this <a href='something'>is a</a> test" => ["hey", "this", "<a href='something'>is", "a</a>", "it"] ?
[07:16:03] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: what does your file_obj_list look like?
[07:16:22] <xdxd> lucky-- i will be able to upload this to my hosting ? cuz i see there some installations etc...
[07:16:55] <Xotix> bjesus for what do u need this?
[07:17:06] <Lucky--> xdxd: http://bit.ly/JzlJ6q
[07:17:24] <pachet> ?eval "hey this <a href='something'>is a</a> test".split(' ')
[07:17:27] <bot-t> pachet: ["hey", "this", "<a", "href='something'>is", "a</a>", "test"]
[07:17:32] <bjesus> Xotix: something that has to do a screen-reader i'm making.
[07:17:34] <pachet> oh i see, z
[07:18:16] <bjesus> pachet: yeah but i have to get the "<a" and "herf=.."  together. i guess i need some regex but i can't figure it out
[07:18:57] <Xotix> bjesus:  just for this format of  a href?
[07:19:30] <bjesus> Xotix: no, i just don't want the script to break tags. any tags
[07:20:09] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: looking at it, i believe it's the wrapper div that gets returned
[07:20:53] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: and what's in obj from your after_open call?
[07:21:10] <m4xx> oh
[07:21:14] <m4xx> shit sorry, i got that backwards
[07:21:20] <bjesus> "something with <img src='file.jpg' /> and words" => ["something", "with", "<img src='file.jpg />", "and", "words"]
[07:21:27] <m4xx> one sec i'll paste you the file_obj_list
[07:22:12] <Xotix> bjesus: ah, hmm I'm not a profi but id go lie kthat: Create a function which reads a string. Check from start til lthe next space, check if this would breake a tag, if yes go to the end tag and save it  as one index, then proceed until the next space etc. you could check for < get the word after it and check if there is </the word> it isn't very easy made i think and is quite error prone.
[07:23:24] <antnash_> Dov_Rine: Got any experience with $.post and file uploads?
[07:23:35] <Lucky--> lol. facebook compiles their php into c++ and then compile it to run native
[07:23:42] <bjesus> Xotix: yeah that seems like a good idea. i'm worried about preformence but i'll see how it goes. maybe i'll manage to create some regex. thanks
[07:24:01] <m4xx> Dove_Rine: http://paste2.org/p/2031684
[07:24:20] <serard> hello
[07:24:24] <m4xx> antnash_: you cant use ajax to post files
[07:24:31] <IamTrying> How can i tell jQuery, hey listen the press was done on .go but in he position of left:300px; top:10px; ? e.g: $('.go').live("click", function(){..
[07:24:31] <stenno|work> hello
[07:24:37] <m4xx> build a form and target it at an iframe
[07:24:43] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: ok, i'm checking it now
[07:25:14] <IamTrying> <div class=go style=here is one background picture> <input type=text />  </div>
[07:25:17] <stenno|work> IamTrying, oncllick gives you the event element
[07:25:26] <stenno|work> there you can check position etc
[07:25:32] <stenno|work> so do:
[07:25:40] <stenno|work> $('.go').live("click", function(e){..
[07:25:42] <Xotix> bjesus: you can ask in #regex
[07:25:51] <Xotix> or ask at stackoverflow
[07:25:58] <m4xx> i mean, i could pass the parent node's id as an argument in the ajax call, but that feels diry
[07:26:01] <IamTrying> stenno|work, thank you.
[07:26:18] <jmotta> is there any template engine (like Mustache or Dust) that renders or has a feature to render map collections natively? or do I have to iterate over the map collection programatically and then render it
[07:26:26] <stenno|work> Mustache ftw
[07:26:33] <stenno|work> also mustache can do that no?
[07:26:36] <IamTrying> stenno|work, (e) { e.offset().left ?
[07:27:59] <antnash_> m4xx: Not for everyone, but http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery
[07:28:06] <antnash_> Just found that
[07:28:21] <stenno|work> IamTrying, check here http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/event.shtml
[07:28:48] <IamTrying> stenno|work, e.pageX or Y found it
[07:28:52] <stenno|work> IamTrying, better yet: here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event
[07:28:58] <HarryPitfall> the new version of xmlhttprequest supports "files"
[07:29:09] <jmotta> stenno|work, mustache can't do that because their keys while accessing objects must be known .. but in a map you do not know which keys it will have until u access it ..
[07:29:12] <HarryPitfall> file upload, multiparts, and some other goodies
[07:29:13] <stenno|work> IamTrying, you might get problems with cross-browser compat
[07:29:18] <m4xx> antnash_:  look at the second post of that page
[07:29:55] <IamTrying> stenno|work, like this way? http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position
[07:30:07] <IamTrying> var x = e.pageX - this.offsetLeft;
[07:30:09] <m4xx> lulz, i guess it depends on what version of html you're using
[07:30:42] <m4xx> as long as you don't care about ie
[07:30:49] <stenno|work> IamTrying, as i said, you might expect some problems with that, that looks really fine though
[07:31:27] <stenno|work> .pageX might behave different in different browsers
[07:31:39] <IamTrying> OK - thank you stenno|work
[07:31:43] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: There's an example in the docs that might work for you.  The data for the example is ajax loaded from here: http://www.jstree.com/static/v.1.0pre/_docs/_json_data.json
[07:31:45] <stenno|work> i remember vaguely about problems with screenX/Y
[07:31:46] <stenno|work> np
[07:32:28] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: the example is here: http://www.jstree.com/documentation/json_data      Using the ajax config option
[07:32:50] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: again, i can load the data just fine for the tree, my problem is, after it's loaded the data, i want to know which node has been loaded with the data
[07:33:00] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, will this approach still work? http://eisabainyo.net/weblog/2009/02/20/store-login-information-in-cookie-using-jquery/
[07:33:06] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: they are returning an infinite regression of nodes in that example
[07:33:13] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: using static data
[07:33:18] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, will this approach still work? http://eisabainyo.net/weblog/2009/02/20/store-login-information-in-cookie-using-jquery/ using the latest jquery api?
[07:33:41] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: all of your nodes already have id's
[07:33:46] <m4xx> yes
[07:33:49] <thomaslfromz> what is :eq(0)
[07:33:54] <stenno|work> all your ids belong to nodes
[07:34:06] <m4xx> *are belong to
[07:34:06] <stenno|work> thomaslfromz, css3 pseudoselector
[07:34:15] <stenno|work> m4xx, right, fail >_>"
[07:34:17] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: that's a property of the node that fired the event
[07:34:26] <m4xx> yes
[07:34:34] <m4xx> how would i get that property, after the data has been loaded
[07:34:37] <Lucky--> question, would u guys think that serializing hte form data to json, storing the json string in a session var, and then using a .each with a .find to repop the form is a good approach to maintain form data?
[07:34:51] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: you get it when the node is clicked
[07:35:21] <thomaslfromz> oh, will not work in IE7 then?
[07:35:24] <m4xx> so i shouldn't be using the build in functionality then
[07:35:57] <vl1234> gud evening frnds
[07:35:58] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: it is built in, but if you try to load all of the data, immediately after loading the dir tree, then you are defeating the purpose
[07:36:31] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: you dont want to load the files until you expand the dir node.  at the moment, you are loading all of the dir nodes for a volume.
[07:37:06] <vl1234> whenever am loading dynamic json file in single html page creating a some jquery problem
[07:37:15] <m4xx> so you're saying bind a clickevent and use load_node_json?
[07:37:21] <vl1234> am using jquery1.7.1
[07:38:07] <vl1234> Error : Gecko does not error, returns false instead
[07:38:24] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: i would start by binding a click event and logging the id.  once that's done, i think that load_node_json is what you want, but you may have to look through the docs a little more to be sure.
[07:38:59] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: there seemed to be a couple of potentially promising methods for you to choose from.
[07:39:07] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: thanks, i'll give it a shot =]
[07:39:36] <vl1234> @Dov u have any idea about my error message
[07:40:29] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: good luck.  i'll be lurking for a while.  i have to finish some other things here.
[07:40:35] <m4xx> =]
[07:41:04] <Dov_Rine> vl1234: i read your msg 3 times now and have no idea what you are trying to say.
[07:42:02] <Dov_Rine> vl1234: the troublesome parts for me are "dynamic json file", "in single html page", "creating a some jquery problem"
[07:42:27] <vl1234> and its chrome only
[07:42:50] <vl1234> FF and IE workin fine
[07:43:14] <Dov_Rine> vl1234: you have not described a problem yet as far as I can tell
[07:44:01] <vl1234> k ill explain
[07:44:51] <Dov_Rine> vl1234: i need to relocate soon.
[07:45:01] <thomaslfromz> noob needs help again ;-)
[07:45:03] <thomaslfromz> http://jsfiddle.net/huWqz/1/
[07:45:39] <thomaslfromz> when I check the first checkbox "Ganze Schweiz" all checkboxes needs to be checked
[07:45:57] <thomaslfromz> If I uncheck it, none should be checked
[07:46:14] <thomaslfromz> should not behave the same way on the other checkboxes
[07:46:53] <vl1234> i have a single html page with 5 diff buttons when ever am clickin a button that time callin ajax function gettin json file and display it in div part..........am clickin another button that time the ajax function is called and executed but after that its came to first button functionality
[07:47:16] <thomaslfromz> vl1234: jsfiddle?
[07:47:36] <m4xx> Dov_Rine: i got it ;D
[07:47:47] <m4xx> my problem was my event handler was only accepting one argument
[07:48:10] <m4xx> the second argument is the node that was clicked
[07:48:11] <m4xx> ;[
[07:48:19] <Dov_Rine> vl1234: you will probably have to paste your code.  i suspect that you setting the url globally or that you have a syntax error.
[07:48:24] <vl1234> @thomas.......just a min
[07:48:26] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: that's great

[07:50:45] <thomaslfromz> explain .myspacename?
[07:50:45] <m4xx> i also can't believe that such a cool and useful plugin has such terrible docs
[07:51:27] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: writing docs is big pita and not fun for most ppl who write libraries
[07:51:48] <m4xx> if that's the case, then there should be more comments in the code
[07:52:51] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: i agree with you.  actually, i think that not enough ppl consider the docs to actually be part of the project.  once the library is stable, they want to get it out there asap.
[07:54:05] <m4xx> if they used phpdoc they can have the have the docs write them self ;x
[07:54:29] <m4xx> for me phpdoc + netbeans = bliss
[07:54:50] <TimTim`> i'm gonna feel really dumb if this functionality already exists in jquery, but i couldn't find it, so i made it
[07:55:19] <pachet> thomaslfromz: its just a good habit
[07:55:28] <pachet> if you namespace your bindings, you can remove them later individually
[07:55:29] <TimTim`> if you look at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring and how those methods are attached to the $.fn.whateverPlugin
[07:55:39] <pachet> $(foo).off('change.mynamespace') wont remove other changes bound to that elem
[07:55:51] <Dov_Rine> m4xx: i gotta go.  best of luck to you guys.
[07:56:24] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, what is the .js file for the jquery cookie plugin?
[07:57:00] <TimTim`> i wanted a way to extend plugins and their methods (seen at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring), with access to its super class
[07:57:24] <TimTim`> so i made it... but i was wondering if this functionality already exists elsewhere in jQuery natively?
[07:57:47] <stenno|work> TimTim`, $.extend  :)
[07:58:04] <TimTim`> lol i know about extend but look at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[07:59:15] <d3f4ultr0> anyone please?
[07:59:28] <stenno|work> no i am not, because i am leaving right now :)
[08:02:23] <d3f4ultr0> i think i found it, https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/blob/master/jquery.cookie.js
[08:06:50] <bribroder> hey guys, can I target elements that have names but not IDs? like <input name="zip" type="text">
[08:07:39] <chilversc_> you could use $(document.getElementsByName(...))
[08:08:14] <chilversc_> bribroder: not sure if $("[name='zip']") will be opmitimised to use getElementsByName, but that will also work
[08:10:05] <ndugu> how do you center full sized images with jquery cycle and make them fade when you click on them?
[08:10:44] <thomaslfromz> ndugu:  with css
[08:11:17] <thomaslfromz> look at the jquery cycle docs for the fade
[08:11:21] <ndugu> but i don't know how to work it out
[08:11:24] <ndugu> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/center-with-jquery-cycle-plugin
[08:11:26] <ndugu> i've tried
[08:11:28] <bribroder> sweet, thanks a bunch chilversc_ it looks like both of your suggestions work
[08:11:44] <ndugu> it won't center fully
[08:11:54] <hooloovoo> lol
[08:11:59] <ndugu> yeah
[08:12:01] <ndugu> lol
[08:12:09] <ndugu> a lot of people just died
[08:12:14] <hooloovoo> =(
[08:12:20] <ndugu> :(
[08:12:31] <thomaslfromz> or their computers?
[08:12:42] <ndugu> maybe
[08:13:14] <ndugu> i would really appreciate if someone could answer the forum question
[08:13:17] <thomaslfromz> ndugu:  http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/faq.html
[08:13:29] <thomaslfromz> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/center-horz.html
[08:14:19] <ndugu> i've read that and i admit i'm not a programmer. all the time i do something wrong
[08:15:14] <thomaslfromz> paste your code, so we can help
[08:15:20] <thomaslfromz> but not in here ;-)
[08:15:26] <ndugu> maybe something will work if i add something to .slideshow { } and .slideshow img { }
[08:15:43] <ndugu> thomaslfromz: it's here - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/center-with-jquery-cycle-plugin
[08:15:54] <ndugu> :)
[08:17:09] <thomaslfromz> slideshow div img { margin: auto; display: block }
[08:17:20] <thomaslfromz> but that is just an css problem
[08:17:23] <thomaslfromz> not jquery
[08:17:39] <ndugu> ok
[08:17:46] <ndugu> i think i've tried that
[08:17:49] <kaylee> does anyone happen to know if there's an easy way to make one jquery progress bar overlap (display on top of) another progress bar?
[08:17:49] <ndugu> but i will try again
[08:18:01] <kaylee> or is there a better/easier way to show two values?
[08:18:25] <thomaslfromz> css position absolute
[08:18:38] <WebDragon> updating one site from jquery 1.3.2 to 1.7.2 I', running into an issue where var matchresult = SlideBar.css("background-image").match( imageRegex ); is returning undefined. imageRegex = /url\("?(.*?)(\/images\/.*?)"?\)/ in case anyone was wondering
[08:19:08] <WebDragon> why would this be returning undefined under 1.7.2 ?
[08:19:16] <WebDragon> did I miss a change?
[08:21:02] <NoiseEee> WebDragon: try backgroundImage instead of background-image ?
[08:21:27] <WebDragon> kaylee: http://www.bestfreewebresources.com/2011/11/20-awesome-jquery-file-uploader-plugins.html  you mean simultaneous progress bars?
[08:21:33] <ndugu> thomaslfromz: they still didn't center
[08:22:33] <WebDragon> NoiseEee: *facepalm* I bet that's it -- I should be using css({"background-image"}) or css("backgroundImage")
[08:23:19] <kaylee> WebDragon: I'm making a donation thermometer, on one bar I'd like to display "Goal' 100%, 'pledged' and 'paid'
[08:23:36] <kaylee> so pledged may be 75% but actual money received may only be 25%
[08:24:00] <kaylee> if that makes sense in terms of how I want it to look
[08:24:06] <WebDragon> kaylee: why not use a graphing plugin instead of progress-bars ?
[08:24:23] <kaylee> WebDragon: *shrug*... I did ask if there's a better way to do it :D
[08:24:27] <WebDragon> :D
[08:24:36] <kaylee> progress bar was just one thing that came to mind initially...
[08:24:44] <WebDragon> yeah, understandably
[08:24:58] <WebDragon> usually they're used for live active content (ajax transfer, etc)
[08:25:09] <kaylee> yeah, doesn't need to be live or active
[08:25:31] <ndugu> brb
[08:25:40] <kaylee> recommended plugin?
[08:25:58] <WebDragon> http://www.jqplot.com/ looks good
[08:26:28] <WebDragon> http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/top-jquery-chart-libraries-interactive-charts/  google search also turns up this ;)
[08:26:35] <kaylee> :D
[08:26:40] * WebDragon hides a chuckling cough in his coffeemug :D
[08:26:50] <kaylee> differences in key words ;)
[08:26:53] <WebDragon> (seeing as the homonym suits perfectly)
[08:27:02] * WebDragon studies the ceiling for leaks
[08:27:05] <WebDragon> 100% completely innocent angelic look (99% margin for error)  O :-)
[08:28:26] <WebDragon> kaylee: http://code.google.com/p/flot/ also looks good
[08:28:41] <truk77> Is there a jquery function that will give me the current version of the jquery instance that's loaded?
[08:29:23] <bribroder> truk77: $().jquery;
[08:30:16] <truk77> Thanks bribroder
[08:30:41] <bribroder> yep!
[08:30:55] <ndugu> can i add something to .slideshow { } to center images?
[08:36:02] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, can someone please help me why it doesn't remember my username and password? Please don't tell me about security issue using this approach. I just want to try it. Thanks. http://www.webdevout.net/test?0E
[08:37:32] <ndugu> they are still not centered
[08:37:35] <ndugu> http://chrlie.com/index2.htm
[08:38:51] <mcampo84> Hi all! I'm trying to have a nested list display its data as though it were an independent page (i.e. with the standard header and footer for my mobile site).  Is there a way to do this?
[08:39:27] <truk77> So yeah, stuff works a lot better now that I've found that this code was loading jquery 1.4...
[08:40:54] <ndugu> this drives me insane
[08:42:43] <d3f4ultr0> is something wrong with my jquery cookie because it's not remember the username/password I entered - http://www.webdevout.net/test?0E
[08:43:26] <mcampo84> Disregard my previous question - that was meant for jQueryMobile.
[08:43:44] <ndugu> i'm doing all the things on the centering images pages, but they are still not fully centered
[08:44:42] <ndugu> there must be some way to solve it
[08:44:49] <ndugu> but i don't know how
[08:46:35] <ndugu> will someone help me centering images?
[08:46:54] <WebDragon> NoiseEee: no, for some reason Slidebar.css("backgroundImage") or "background-image are both returning undefined no matter where I am in the 'step' sequence of loading slides
[08:48:34] <NoiseEee> WebDragon: you sure Slidebar is what you think it is?
[08:48:54] <WebDragon> yeah, script inspector in the debugger proves it
[08:49:11] <NoiseEee> hmm dunno :\
[08:49:24] <NoiseEee> jsfiddle etc :)
[08:49:40] <WebDragon> heh
[08:49:43] <ndugu> i need to center images
[08:50:31] <ndugu> im sure you can just add something to this code, but i dont know what
[08:51:30] <ndugu> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/center-with-jquery-cycle-plugin
[08:55:38] <ndugu> i've tried adding .slideshow { margin: 20px auto; } and .slideshow img { margin: auto; display: block }, but the pictures are still not fully centered
[08:56:12] <DeltaHeavy> I have dynamic content from AJAX and I have an event that applies to a class. The AJAX event writes a bunch of new HTML, but the new HTML doesn't seem to be linking up with events that were already initalized. How do I connect new content to old events?
[08:56:49] <ndugu> maybe it's impossible
[08:56:55] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: you should use .on() to delegate the events from a known container element
[08:56:57] <johnkpaul> ?on @ DeltaHeavy
[08:56:57] <bot-t> DeltaHeavy, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:57:24] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks
[08:57:45] <ndugu> why do you help all the others if my question is so easy to answer?
[08:59:02] <ndugu> :(
[09:00:03] <playsexwebcam> playsexwebcam.com  entry here and get 120 credits free for chat, more guys and girls
[09:00:15] <johnkpaul> ndugu: if it's so easy to answer, why are you asking it?
[09:00:24] <johnkpaul> I don't know anything about the jquery cycle plugin to help you
[09:00:51] <silverwind> And of course.. we HAVE TO support all 3rd party jQuery plugins no matter how shitty they are...
[09:01:36] <rizall> hello people to someone who understands that ajax can give me a help with a script
[09:02:39] <ndugu> johnkpaul: ok :)
[09:02:40] <silverwind> rizall, Sure, write a small testcase
[09:03:44] <rizall> silverwind I do not quite understand is it possible to view directly to my site?
[09:04:07] <silverwind> Sure, if the ajax is not mixed up with tons of non-working code :P
[09:04:16] <DeltaHeavy> .on seems to be doing a lot and I'm getting confused in the documentation how to refer to certain things. If I have an even that's: "$('.hover').hover(function() {", and a new tag called '#button', and I want #button to run under the hover event, how would that go? "$('.hover').on('click');"?
[09:04:50] <Keir__> if i have some data in a variable and i want it to be picked up by my php as $_POST['test'] for example, how i can make the data be sent as a post titled test?
[09:05:12] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: this should help https://gist.github.com/1749717#file_on.js
[09:05:39] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: except instead of click, use hover
[09:06:17] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: I think you want $("#button").on("hover",".hover", hoverHandler);
[09:06:33] <DeltaHeavy> What's hoverHandler? That's what was confusing me the most.
[09:06:46] <johnkpaul> that will delegate all hovers of elements with class hover that are below the element with id #button
[09:07:07] <johnkpaul> hoverHandler is whatever function you used to have handle the hover in your original
[09:07:32] <DeltaHeavy> So the entire function again?
[09:07:52] <alexr2> i need a plugin that will change css styles (with animation) based on the class that i'm adding to a div.  anyone know of anything like that?
[09:08:08] <DeltaHeavy> johnkpaul: I'm unsure what you mean
[09:08:19] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: well, you can define it once and store it in a variable
[09:08:24] <alexr2> so... if class1 had width 50px, class2 had width 100px.  when i add class2, it'll do a animate() to 100px width
[09:08:30] <johnkpaul> but after changing to use .on() you don't necessarily need the .hover() call anymore
[09:09:11] <johnkpaul> alexr2: there's no jquery plugin afaik, but that's just css3 transitions
[09:09:14] <DeltaHeavy> johnkpaul: So I have to store my entire hover function in a variable? Wouldn't this be the exact same thing as copy pasting the original function?
[09:09:30] <alexr2> okay, thanks johnkpaul
[09:09:34] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: no, it is not the same, your defining one function, not two
[09:09:37] <DeltaHeavy> It seems my .on is going to use more code than my .hover overall?
[09:09:51] <johnkpaul> eh, by maybe 10 characters at most
[09:10:07] <DeltaHeavy> I'm confused as all hell so let me make a pastebin
[09:10:18] <johnkpaul> $(".hover").hover(hoverHandler) -> $(#button").on("hover", ".hover", hoverHandler);
[09:10:26] <johnkpaul> maybe 15? :) I'm not counting
[09:10:36] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @DeltaHeavy
[09:14:13] <DeltaHeavy> johnkpaul: http://pastebin.com/4JzkdTD5
[09:15:12] <Keir__> if i send an object with post request, should it not be picked up by php by $_POST['objectName']?
[09:15:26] <DeltaHeavy> Keir__: Yep
[09:15:53] <Keir__> its not - which is frustrating :P
[09:16:15] <DeltaHeavy> It is, you're just doing it wrong xP
[09:16:59] <Keir__> yeah thats true :P
[09:17:12] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: http://jsfiddle.net/3cxEt/
[09:17:31] <johnkpaul> sorry, I was confusing you because hover took two arguments and I forgot that it was mouseenter and mouseleave under the hood
[09:17:46] <johnkpaul> let me know if that makes sense
[09:17:52] <DeltaHeavy> np, god damn I thought it would be less...idk
[09:18:11] <DeltaHeavy> I was just expecting "Event x, start considering this a part of '.hover'
[09:18:45] <Keir__> its just if i do console.log(objectName); i can see the object
[09:19:06] <Keir__> but if i do $.ajax({ data = objectName, etcetc})
[09:19:10] <DeltaHeavy> Keir__: At most you'll see something like [object Object]
[09:19:34] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: that is what that code is doing
[09:19:50] <Keir__> then if i do in the php if(isset($_POST['objectName'])) { echo 'it worked'; } nothing happens
[09:20:03] <Keir__> even though the success of the ajax call is triggered
[09:20:09] <phidah> Hi. I use UI sortable - is there any way I can distinguish between a "move to a connected list" and a "sort in the existing list" event?
[09:20:16] <phidah> seems that update is called on both
[09:20:30] <DeltaHeavy> johnkpaul: Idk, I just think it could be done more gracefully. It's doing what I want it to do but it looks more complicated than it needs to be.
[09:20:32] <d3f4ultr0> what's wrong with this code, i cannot put the value to my other input field -  $('#CookieValue').val() = $.cookie('test'));
[09:20:40] <tompaw> Hm... is it possible to make <tr>'s click even work on iOS Safari?
[09:20:51] <tompaw> even = event
[09:21:36] <Whirl3d> hey all. if you resolve a Deferred object, can you also resolveWith() later? Can you distribute the resolution of a Deferred Object using resolveWith() or is it a one time shot...meaning that once it's resolved, the target is final (if resolved with--the with target is permanent)?
[09:21:51] <plbyrd> Hello!
[09:22:03] <johnkpaul> d3f4ultr0: that's not how .val works
[09:22:05] <johnkpaul> .val(newValue)
[09:22:11] <johnkpaul> ?val @ d3f4ultr0
[09:22:12] <bot-t> d3f4ultr0, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[09:22:18] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: you can't resolve multiple times
[09:22:18] <d3f4ultr0> oh ok
[09:22:21] <plbyrd> I'm trying to use the contents of a SPAN as a callout.  What's the best plugin for doing so?
[09:22:31] <fris> you dont use .val to set a val
[09:22:36] <plbyrd> I've tried qTip and it didn't work.
[09:22:40] <d3f4ultr0> what should I use then to grab the value of the cookie then place it in the textbox?
[09:22:40] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: after getting used to it, it doesn't feel complicated, but I could see that thought when you first see it
[09:23:01] <d3f4ultr0> fris, I am not setting it. I just want to grab it and put it to a different text box
[09:23:05] <johnkpaul> d3f4ultr0: did you read that link?
[09:23:06] <blendedbychris> what's the proper way to clone a fieldset? and append it .after() ?
[09:23:17] <johnkpaul> ?clone @blendedbychris
[09:23:17] <bot-t> blendedbychris, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[09:23:17] <d3f4ultr0> doing now
[09:23:24] <fris> ya i know, i was referring to johnkpaul with the newvalue remark
[09:23:29] <johnkpaul> ?append @ blendedbychris
[09:23:29] <bot-t> blendedbychris, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[09:23:33] <blendedbychris> probably .after
[09:23:41] <johnkpaul> fris: this is the jquery channel, what do you mean?
[09:24:05] <fris> johnkpaul you said .val(newvalue) when val is used to get, not set
[09:24:43] <johnkpaul> I did?
[09:24:59] <johnkpaul> I thought d3f4ultr0 was asking about how to set the value, if I did, I was wrong
[09:25:01] <DeltaHeavy> johnkpaul: It just seems logical to have something that works like '$(classToAddToEvent).on(classInQuestionForEventInQuestion, actionOfEvenInQuestion)
[09:25:04] <fris> [12:22pm] <johnkpaul> .val(newValue)
[09:25:16] <d3f4ultr0> johnkpaul, I have the code that sets it and it's working fine
[09:25:41] <johnkpaul> d3f4ultr0: is this code intended to set the value of #Cookievalue? $('#CookieValue').val() = $.cookie('test')
[09:25:50] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: that's because it's how delegation works
[09:25:59] <DeltaHeavy> They should change it @_@ It's dumb
[09:26:01] <d3f4ultr0> i also have get that grabs the cookie. However, I added another textbox so I can put the value to another textbox
[09:26:02] <plbyrd> Does anyone know of a way to incorporate ASP.Net Validators into jQuery?  The validators create a SPAN with the text, but I want that span to display in a callout.
[09:26:22] <d3f4ultr0> this is the code that sets it -  $.cookie('test', $('#Text1').val());
[09:26:35] <d3f4ultr0> let ,me pastebin the code
[09:26:45] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: if you're that concerned, wrap it with what you want, but I bet it will start to feel more natural after a while, when you understand how delegation works
[09:27:00] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @d3f4ultr0
[09:27:01] <bot-t> d3f4ultr0, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[09:27:13] <d3f4ultr0> k
[09:27:46] <DeltaHeavy> I'm sure it'll get easier as I use it I just don't understand why they don't make it more simple in the first place. .on seems pretty useless to me right now cause I can just call .hover again
[09:28:04] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: what do you mean?
[09:28:17] <johnkpaul> if you call .hover() again, it won't work with newly added elements
[09:28:32] <johnkpaul> there's a performance overhead to this delegation, why would jquery force you to take that hit
[09:28:39] <DeltaHeavy> I just copy paste the whole event
[09:28:49] <DeltaHeavy> Recreate it
[09:29:07] <johnkpaul> no, don't copy and paste it, you only need it once
[09:29:18] <johnkpaul> don't use hover() _and_ .on()
[09:29:35] <DeltaHeavy> I'll just use hover twice
[09:29:53] <DeltaHeavy> idk, .on makes any event it calls to be useless and rewritten into functions
[09:30:10] <johnkpaul> :) that's a best practice anyway DeltaHeavy
[09:30:26] <johnkpaul> if you use hover twice, make sure you unbind all of the events first
[09:30:31] <johnkpaul> or else you'll double the event handlers
[09:30:32] <JAAulde> Sup sup sup, my fellow jQuerians!?
[09:30:39] <DeltaHeavy> A function with one line of code makes me want to rage uncontrollably
[09:31:36] <bcardarella> Is there a way to include just one specific easing in my js? I don't want to include all of jQueryUI but I do want the easeOutBounce easing available
[09:31:37] <Jon47> really
[09:31:40] * JAAulde is in the middle of a test/defect-fixing sprint, rocking his Skrillex Pandora station, wishing he had something cool to code instead of what he's working on
[09:31:43] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: oh, that, that's not requried by jquery
[09:31:56] <Jon47> Deltaheavy what if that one line contains a lot of business logic and needs to be invoked in multiple places
[09:31:58] <johnkpaul> you don't have to do it that way, that's just the best way for me to explain it to you because it's less code at the top
[09:32:03] <Jon47> i think encapsulating the logic into a single line is a good idea
[09:32:20] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, I just imagined they'd make it work differently

[09:35:46] <nail__> jquery mobile - Is that "normal" that the loading widget does not block the content behind? If yes, is there some built-in way to have the behaviour?
[09:35:50] <nail__> that

[09:37:22] <karl_heinz> hello, i'm using the jquery validation engine. how can I get the result of the validation?
[09:37:25] <blendedbychris> if i have select name="child[][week]" is this not correct " $('select[name="child[][week]"]')"
[09:37:56] <blendedbychris> oh wait got it
[09:40:31] <d3f4ultr0> i can't get it to work in jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/cJ5y2/
[09:41:12] <d3f4ultr0> the alert does not work in jsfiddle but works on my computer
[09:42:27] <d3f4ultr0> basically, when I click the "Put cookie value to right textbox", I also want the value of the cookie to get displayed on the textbox that is on the right
[09:46:09] <princeES> my images wouldnt load on my jquery slider please have a look on it..... http://www.insidevelop.com
[09:49:23] <d3f4ultr0> I got it working :) $('#CookieValue').val($.cookie('test'));
[09:50:13] <Lundy> Heya guys, im just wondering if anyone could help me here with this little bit off code. For some reason when I try to Alert code from the data retrived I get "undefinded" here is the code and below it is the Returned json information. http://codepad.org/f3PuAxKZ
[09:50:45] <d3f4ultr0> the reason I'm trying to learn this is because I need to implement "Remember me" in jquery
[09:50:53] <d3f4ultr0> using cookies
[09:54:35] <Lundy> anyone?
[09:56:49] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, what do I modify in the code so that the right textbox gets automatically populated when I reload the page? http://jsfiddle.net/cJ5y2/2/
[10:03:08] <Dr-Bombay> lundy: it looks like you are receiving an array and you are not using it as an array
[10:04:04] <Dr-Bombay> newObject[0].code
[10:04:52] <fission6> anyone have a javascript template rec?
[10:05:59] <jeffsmykil> Is chaining selectors inherently slower than not chaining them, or am I just seeing a normal amount of time if i added it up computing the non chained selectorrs?
[10:06:14] <tw2113> fission6 <script></script>
[10:06:22] <tw2113> or if you want external
[10:06:45] <tw2113> myscript.js
[10:06:55] <fission6> ?
[10:06:57] <Dr-Bombay> fission6's question is not clear and I doubt he's asking "how do I javascrpit"
[10:06:59] <fission6> i mean a rendering template
[10:07:05] <tw2113> fission6 sarcasm :D
[10:07:07] <fission6> mustache handlebars
[10:07:25] <tw2113> jeffsmykil i would think chaining would be more efficient than re-selecting the dom element every new line
[10:07:53] <Dr-Bombay> defaultro: set a load handler
[10:07:57] <jeffsmykil> tw2113: mmk
[10:08:10] <jeffsmykil> this one just seems like its taking a lot of time and its chained
[10:08:17] <tw2113> which looks more efficient?
[10:08:18] <CalebMingle> what exactly are you chaining?
[10:08:28] <tw2113> $('#mydiv').css().delay().foobar()
[10:08:28] <CalebMingle> are these built in jQuery methods you're chaining or your own?
[10:08:54] <tw2113> or $('#mydiv').css(); $('#mydiv').delay(); $('#mydiv').foobar();
[10:09:10] <Talon_> is there any jquery plugins for 3D rendering on a canvas?
[10:09:58] <Dr-Bombay> there shouldn't be any performance problems with that
[10:10:38] <Dr-Bombay> talon: what do you need that isn't already in the 2d context?
[10:10:50] <zoned> if i want to programmatically unfocus a text input field, how would i do it? i've tried both focusout() and blur(), neither seem to work..
[10:10:54] <d3f4ultr0> I have this code $(document).delegate('#submit-login', 'click', function (e)   then on my submit button, code is <input id="submit-login" type="submit" name="submit" value="Login" />       How come it's not calling the function?
[10:11:22] <blendedbychris> i'm curious
[10:11:44] <blendedbychris> when doing a .clone() is it possible for jquery to retain an existing .change() event for that new element?
[10:11:45] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, $("#submit-login").click(function(e) { console.log(e); });
[10:11:56] <zoned> does that work?
[10:12:04] <Dr-Bombay> oh joy, the backup plugins site is gone
[10:12:04] <d3f4ultr0> trying
[10:12:56] <Dr-Bombay> zoned: he's using delegate for all of his handlers and you just told him to mix event attachment methods :0
[10:12:57] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, in any case, you should be using .on instead of .delegate or .live. or just bind directly with .click (like above)
[10:13:10] <zoned> Dr-Bombay, :P ^
[10:13:47] <Dr-Bombay> zoned: what's more, your suggestion probably won't work
[10:13:56] <Dr-Bombay> because he's not attaching in a load/ready handler
[10:14:19] <Talon_> Dr-Bombay: 3D basically is 2D trickery, I was just wondering rather than building something from scratch, I'm sure there are people out there smarter than me who have a better idea for 3D lol, basically mapping out points in 3D space, mapping those points to faces, backface culling, texture mapping, etc...
[10:14:31] <zoned> Talon_, check out 3.js
[10:15:43] <zoned> if i want to programmatically unfocus a text input field, how would i do it? i've tried both focusout() and blur(), neither seem to work..
[10:16:37] <Talon_> zoned: wow lol I didn't know there was a webGL, thats way more advanced than my attempt lol
[10:16:37] <d3f4ultr0> i'm getting an  error saying JQuery is not defined
[10:16:57] <d3f4ultr0> but i have this, <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[10:18:36] <Dr-Bombay> please don't leech jquery in a deployed web page
[10:19:11] <d3f4ultr0> wait, my box can't is not connected to the internet. That's why, lol
[10:19:12] <zoned> Dr-Bombay, i disagree. everyone should use google's cdn.
[10:19:48] <Dr-Bombay> zoned: you're insane
[10:20:38] <zoned> if everyone did it, everyone's browser would have jquery cached already. furthermore, google's servers are going to be faster than yours. and have a higher uptime. there's really no reason not to trust it. i'm not advocating other cdn's, however.
[10:21:12] <Whirl3d> I have an array of basic objects that contain an attribute labeled "series". I need to extract a list of "series" from the array (although multiple elements have the same series attribute value, I just want one "series" value returned). Is there an easy way to do this? I am using $.map currently.
[10:22:22] <LukeNukem> Cork, Hey you up?
[10:22:22] <bot-t> (203 hours ago) <coldhead> tell LukeNukem ping me buddy
[10:23:18] <LukeNukem> bot-t, you're late!
[10:23:19] <bot-t> LukeNukem, Concentrate and ask again.
[10:23:50] <tw2113> bot-t you're slow like loading jquery from your own server instead of google's cdn version
[10:24:00] <tw2113> allegedly
[10:24:21] <LukeNukem> yeh
[10:24:50] <zoned> ha^^
[10:25:03] <LukeNukem> zoned, whut :P
[10:25:28] <zoned> "bot-t you're slow like loading jquery from your own server instead of google's cdn version"
[10:25:40] <tw2113> i made a funny
[10:26:00] <LukeNukem> can someone help me use $.map ;_;
[10:27:05] <bribroder> the google version loads more quickly? could you use that on an SSL page without throwing insecure warnings?
[10:27:08] <NoiseEee> zoned: the stats actually show otherwise, if you google, but its up to you. certainly i'd rather send a minified version from my server than make an http request somewhere else, have the dns resolve, etc
[10:27:29] <zoned> not if its already cached, though.
[10:28:15] <NoiseEee> zoned: can't find the articles right now, but with so many versions of jq in the wild, the odds of it being cached aren't so great
[10:28:21] <NoiseEee> anyways, ymmv
[10:29:08] <d3f4ultr0> zoned, can't get it to work. This is what I wrote - http://jsfiddle.net/XGqC5/
[10:30:05] <LukeNukem> http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/
[10:30:06] <LukeNukem> :3
[10:30:23] <spiffie> you can use protocol inference to avoid the security warning
[10:30:49] <spiffie> http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/
[10:31:13] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, i simplified it to this: http://jsfiddle.net/XGqC5/ and it worked just fine :/ something else is going on with the rest of your code it seems
[10:31:21] <d3f4ultr0> chekcing
[10:31:23] <d3f4ultr0> thanks
[10:31:28] <zoned> http://jsfiddle.net/XGqC5/1/
[10:31:40] <zoned> wrong link
[10:33:10] <d3f4ultr0> the alert for me still didn't pop up
[10:33:28] <zoned> posted the wrong link, did you see? ^^
[10:33:35] <d3f4ultr0> oh
[10:33:37] <d3f4ultr0> :)
[10:34:46] <tw2113> for how much i advocate blog rss subscribing, i don't know why i wasn't subscribed to the jquery blog yet
[10:35:07] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, is there a reason you're using 1.5 still? lots of improvements made since then. particularly .on / .prop which seem they may be useful for what you're doing. .delegeate/.live aren't as.. nice.
[10:35:34] <d3f4ultr0> zoned, no. RIght now, I;m using the one that LuykeNukem gave
[10:35:39] <d3f4ultr0> 1.7.2
[10:35:53] <zoned> oh ok, earlier i thought you said you were using 1.5.1
[10:37:07] <xdxd> yo guys i have a simple chat but my messages go down.... i want that new mess will be up look my code http://pastebin.com/wVtDV4ti
[10:38:09] <d3f4ultr0> zoned, is there something wrong with the code? Still wont work on my webserver, http://jsfiddle.net/dds3p/
[10:39:32] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, that should definitely work. sure your browser hasn't cached the old code or something?
[10:39:47] <d3f4ultr0> let me clear it
[10:39:58] <knightrage> hi all. i am using .insertBefore() and .insertAfter() for two table rows.. is there a way to have an animation showing the two rows swap places?
[10:40:11] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, maybe something inside cookie.js? is any of that code actually running? i dunno
[10:40:29] <d3f4ultr0> k
[10:40:34] <d3f4ultr0> i'll comment it out
[10:40:45] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5FUVk/16/
[10:41:15] <Whirl3d> such a basic simple stupid thing, I can't see the solution.
[10:43:00] <xdxd> what is  .scrollTop?
[10:43:10] <imsky> ay Whirl3d
[10:43:57] <d3f4ultr0> :( still doesn't work even when I commented my cookie.js
[10:44:26] <zoned> Whirl3d, have you heard of underscore.js ? lots of handy array functions, very fast/lightweight. it will do this for you, fyi
[10:44:56] <Dr-Bombay> xdxd: doesn't the documentation say?
[10:45:20] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, i got nothing then. it works in jsfiddle but not your server.... :/
[10:45:29] <zoned> probably something really simple/stupid going on
[10:45:31] <d3f4ultr0> yup, it's really weird
[10:47:38] <imsky> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/5FUVk/17/
[10:48:49] <mansour> I am trying to get this to work. http://pastebin.com/ugawsbT2
[10:48:50] <Whirl3d> imsky, I took your advice (if you wanna call it that, dummy) and re-configured my gallery to only use one image at a time.
[10:48:57] <mansour> it's not doing anything.
[10:49:06] <Whirl3d> imsky, thanks again for the input.
[10:49:10] <mansour> it related t auto complete
[10:49:11] <d3f4ultr0> i put a breakpoint via firebug but it's still not being called, :(
[10:49:25] <d3f4ultr0> trying IE
[10:49:26] <Whirl3d> I keep thinking I am gonna use underscore.js, but I guess now is the time.
[10:49:28] <imsky> Whirl3d, ok chief. i don't remember saying 1 image at a time, but it's cool
[10:49:47] <mansour> I have been trying to 2 hours to get it to work, but no luck
[10:49:58] <d3f4ultr0> it didn
[10:50:08] <d3f4ultr0> it didn't work in IE too
[10:50:21] <Whirl3d> lol, you harrassed me for having "25 images with opacity:0 and display:none  - a browser "bonanza" I believe youcalled it.) LOL
[10:50:27] <imsky> oh yeah that
[10:50:55] <imsky> btw Whirl3d you don't need underscore, you can just use https://gist.github.com/1044540
[10:51:14] <mansour> anyone ??
[10:51:17] <mansour> http://pastebin.com/ugawsbT2
[10:51:49] <imsky> Whirl3d, unless you're targeting ie8 and older
[10:52:11] <d3f4ultr0> this code, is it in <head> or in <body>   $("#submit-login").click(function(e) {alert('Was called');console.log(e);});
[10:52:23] <d3f4ultr0> i have it in head
[10:52:28] <d3f4ultr0> not sure if that makes a difference
[10:52:50] <Whirl3d> I gotta keep IE8 under in scope. So, I should map the object attributes to an array and filter unique rather than doing it all in one shot?
[10:53:09] <Lucky--> wtf, why is this using get instead of post? http://jsfiddle.net/YKA2c/61/
[10:54:11] <imsky> Whirl3d, there's probably a more efficient way than mine, you can use underscore entirely for processing, without jquery
[10:54:31] <johnkpaul> Lucky--: jsonp doesn't use traditional get or post
[10:54:44] <johnkpaul> well, i suppose that's not exactly true, it uses get because that's how jsonp works
[10:55:44] <Lucky--> ah
[10:56:15] <m4xx> is it possible to create an error delegate with $.on() ?
[10:56:37] <m4xx> so images that are loaded dynamically will trigger the error
[10:58:17] <d3f4ultr0> how do I extract the full source of this, http://jsfiddle.net/XGqC5/1/
[10:58:33] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5FUVk/20/
[10:58:41] <Whirl3d> ^ works
[11:02:41] <d3f4ultr0> huh, the only thing I did is added a breakpoint at the alert and it started working :(
[11:02:47] <d3f4ultr0> what is wrong with this code
[11:04:19] <NoiseEee> off the top of my head, sounds like a race condition / you not planning for async programming, d3f4ultr0
[11:05:00] <NoiseEee> didnt read anything before that though
[11:05:46] <drojas> Hello!
[11:06:20] <plbyrd> Can someone recommend a specific validation plugin that has callouts?
[11:11:37] <drojas> I have a parent div with two child divs.. I'm binding click from the first child and want to modify the inner html of the second child.. can anyone refer any example please?
[11:11:58] <zoned> $(el).blur(); someFunction();  someFunction() is executing before the blur is done?
[11:12:32] <jonclark> zoned, $(el).blur(function() { someFunction() });
[11:12:52] <coldhead> callbacks, they're not just for telemarketers anymore
[11:12:53] <Dr-Bombay> drojas: there's no trick to that
[11:12:55] <zoned> jonclark, i don't want to execute some function on blur, i want to manually trigger blur, THEN call someFunction
[11:13:05] <johnkpaul> drojas: $(".first").click(function(){$(this).next().html("your new html")})
[11:13:34] <jonclark> zoned, that code should do both of those things, which are the same things :)
[11:14:32] <blendedbychris> http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/ << anyone actually read that IE paragraph
[11:14:47] <blendedbychris> JScript? what?
[11:14:56] <zoned> jonclark, not the same... .blur(someFunction); will wait until the input loses focus before calling someFunc. i want to programatically blur the element, then when blur is finished call someFunc.
[11:15:24] <zoned> oh, do i do .blur(someFunc); el.trigger("blur"); ?
[11:15:40] <Dr-Bombay> blended: what about it
[11:15:54] <Dr-Bombay> it was written by Microsoft, obviously
[11:16:02] <jonclark> zoned, ah i see
[11:16:14] <Dr-Bombay> and Adobe's paragraph was written by Adobe
[11:16:15] <jonclark> zoned, yeah, you have it right now
[11:16:40] <JuJuBee> I have a form with 7 input text boxes.  2 fields are checked using ajax and that is working fine.  I'm trying to disable the submit button until all fields are filled in and uname and email are good.  Not sure what is wrong with http://pastebin.com/ZzwNAJqW  but the submit button is still disabled even if form is good.  Any help?
[11:16:46] <jonclark> calling blur() with no params = .trigger('blur'), otherwise it binds to the event
[11:16:50] <jonclark> good luck :)
[11:17:20] <zoned> got it, thx
[11:17:24] <Dr-Bombay> blended: the existence of "programming languages" separately from implementations is one of the great myths of software development
[11:18:35] <zoned> jonclark, ugh, but now every time it loses focus it is going to call that. i just want to do it the once.. how do i 'unbind' it now?
[11:19:07] <Whirl3d> .one?
[11:19:21] <jonclark> ^
[11:19:31] <zoned> they really did think of everything

[11:45:56] <d3f4ultr0> zoned, I need your help again. I got everything working. However, I have a minor issue. Login.php is not getting called anymore - http://jsfiddle.net/4VPeU/
[11:47:39] <zoned> where?
[11:50:02] <d3f4ultr0> zoned, http://jsfiddle.net/4VPeU/
[11:50:18] <d3f4ultr0> when I click submit, it doesn't call login.php anymore
[11:50:34] <d3f4ultr0> cookies are working, alert was working too
[11:50:37] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, that's because you're calling e.preventDefault
[11:50:51] <d3f4ultr0> ah
[11:50:52] <zoned> which prevents the default action of the submit button from being called
[11:50:58] <zoned> (submission of the form)
[11:51:04] <d3f4ultr0> so that function prevents calling outside files?
[11:51:12] <poppiez> any way to do this more efficiently: this.$myDiv.children('.test').remove().end().children().show();
[11:51:38] <zoned> d3f4ultr0, if you didn't bind a jquery click event to the button, what would its "default" action do?
[11:51:47] <zoned> preventDefault stops that.
[11:51:56] <d3f4ultr0> it will call it
[11:52:10] <d3f4ultr0> YAY, it works!!!
[11:52:12] <d3f4ultr0> :)
[11:52:13] <zoned> in this case, the submit button's default action is to submit the form, thus taking you to login.php
[11:52:21] <d3f4ultr0> got it
[11:52:25] <d3f4ultr0> thanks for your help again

[11:54:42] <thomaslfromz> this works even on jquery 1.4.4 http://jsfiddle.net/KuqHT/3/ but the .is(':checked')); is for 1.6+ I think. It's not working on my Environment with jquery 1.5.2. It's not even generating errors. Can it be?
[11:56:35] <ngharo> Ziber: $('#element').text('foobar').fadeOut(3000);
[11:57:23] <TimTim`> is there a way to get a jquery functions name from within itself?  i.e., $.fn.somePlugin = function(){console.log(this.name)};
[11:57:30] <TimTim`> so $('selector').somePlugin(); would log "somePlugin"
[11:58:01] <TimTim`> i know this sounds silly at first glance, and we'd get derailed if i were to explain why -_-
[11:58:20] <ngharo> Ziber: oops actually i think you want $('#element').text('foobar').delay(3000).fadeOut();
[11:58:22] <TimTim`> i just need to know if it's possible and how
[11:58:29] <silverwind> TimTim`, It depends if the function is named
[11:58:57] <Dr-Bombay> "within itself"?
[11:58:57] <silverwind> $.fn.somePlugin = function(){console.log(this.name)} with return ""     but $.fn.somePlugin = function lol(){console.log(this.name)} should return "lol"
[11:59:03] <d3f4ultr0> is "Remember me" feature for username/password ideal?
[11:59:09] <Dr-Bombay> you don't run code directly within a javascript function
[11:59:12] <TimTim`> ok let me give a more detailed example
[11:59:12] <koud> hello, I have a quick question. If I generate divs from javascript, how can I access their click functions? seems $(".classname").click(function(event) { does not work for divs generated by javascript after dom has been rendered
[11:59:19] <Ziber> ngharo: Found a slightly more convaluted way at first, which now works, but thanks.
[11:59:54] <TimTim`> using the plugin methods example shown at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[12:00:11] <Cade_> Does anyone know a plugin that lets you skin radio buttons, but lets you put a different image on different radio buttons in the same group?
[12:00:11] <TimTim`> suppose somePlugin has some method someMethod
[12:00:14] <thomaslfromz> koud:  look up jquery doc on()
[12:00:17] <Dr-Bombay> oh, you mean in your own plugin
[12:00:29] <ngharo> koud: use $('#somediv').on('.classname', 'click', function() { ... }); see ?on
[12:00:30] <bot-t> koud, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:00:47] <koud> thanks
[12:00:49] <Dr-Bombay> I'm not aware of any way to do that
[12:00:59] <TimTim`> the method within that plugin would be called like $('selector').somePlugin('someMethod', 'arguments, etc.')
[12:01:09] <TimTim`> i want to be able to retreive "somePlugin" from within the "someMethod" method
[12:03:39] <Dr-Bombay> timtim: there's arguments.callee but it's not recommended
[12:03:48] <TimTim`> that doesn't work for what i need
[12:04:21] <Dr-Bombay> that's all there is
[12:04:22] <TimTim`> it sounds silly but the reason is because i'm making plugins act like classes so they can be extended, so suppose someMethod in the super class calls anotherMethod in the current class... i can't think of a good way to do make sure the superclass's version of anotherMethod doesn't get called without getting the current plugin function's name
[12:04:27] <johnkpaul> TimTim`: how would the plugin be defined
[12:04:32] <johnkpaul> functions have "name" properties
[12:04:33] <silverwind> ?eval var x = function() { return  this.name; };
[12:04:35] <bot-t> silverwind: undefined
[12:04:40] <silverwind> ?eval var x = function lol() { return  this.name; };
[12:04:40] <bot-t> silverwind: undefined
[12:04:43] <silverwind> Hmm
[12:04:49] <Dr-Bombay> hmm
[12:04:51] <silverwind> Ahh.. I suck
[12:04:54] <johnkpaul> silverwind: it's called in the context of the global
[12:05:01] <silverwind> ?eval var x = function lol() { return  this.name; }; x();
[12:05:02] <bot-t> silverwind: undefined
[12:05:05] <silverwind> Ahhh ok
[12:05:25] <TimTim`> do yall understand what i'm trying to do?
[12:05:44] <xmaddness> TimTim` yeah. Possibly the use of apply()?
[12:05:51] <johnkpaul> ?eval function lol(){};lol.name
[12:05:51] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "lol"
[12:06:12] <johnkpaul> ?eval var lol = function(){};lol.name
[12:06:12] <bot-t> johnkpaul: ""
[12:06:20] <johnkpaul> TimTim`: make sense?
[12:06:44] <dasdas> does anyone know how works the chat of webchat.freenode.net ?
[12:06:57] <yedimind> black magic ?
[12:07:01] <xmaddness> voodoo
[12:07:08] <TimTim`> johnkpaul i don't think you're following
[12:07:43] <TimTim`> i know you can get the function's name... i'm trying to get the plugin's name from within a method inside a jquery plugin
[12:07:54] <johnkpaul> TimTim`: you cannot, unless you name the function the same
[12:07:58] <johnkpaul> or you set it specifically
[12:08:09] <johnkpaul> if you don't control the plugin code itself
[12:08:14] <johnkpaul> the answer is no, you cannot
[12:08:21] <johnkpaul> actually, that's not true
[12:08:29] <johnkpaul> the answer is no, without some crazy hacking of $.fn
[12:08:53] <TimTim`> i do control the code, how would you suggest i go about it?
[12:10:03] <johnkpaul> $.fn.plugin = function pluginName(){ // in here, use arguments.callee.name == "pluginName"}
[12:10:07] <xmaddness> What we do is create our own plugin plugin
[12:10:08] <johnkpaul> I'm not recommending that
[12:10:15] <johnkpaul> but if you really really really need to do it, that's a way to do it
[12:10:16] <xmaddness> we do $.fn[name]
[12:10:35] <xmaddness> where name is the plugin name
[12:10:41] <TimTim`> you still aren't following entirely, i think i should use jsFiddle
[12:10:47] <TimTim`> 1 sec
[12:11:18] <xmaddness> $.ourPlugin = function(name, obj)_ { $,fn[name] = function() {
[12:11:35] <xmaddness> s/_/
[12:11:43] <xmaddness> erm
[12:11:49] <xmaddness> $.ourPlugin = function(name, obj) { $.fn[name] = function() {
[12:12:47] <xmaddness> then use apply to kick it off
[12:14:36] <Deele> hey everyone, could you help me with contains() selector, I need to find a container that contains "2" or any other integer, that I need, .find(".ui-button-text:contains('<span>2</span>')") but it fails, I mean, I dont want "2" to match "12" or "22", etc
[12:15:33] <tplaner_> hi, can anyone tell me how to prevent this from jumping after the first drag
[12:15:34] <tplaner_> http://jsfiddle.net/29QKb/10/
[12:16:24] <Deele> what does "jumping" means?
[12:17:16] <johnkpaul> Deele: I'd probably use .filter() and a regular expression for that
[12:18:14] <Deele> tplaner_, that is because, you are referencing to "base" position, not current position, that is why with every start of drag, it starts from base and moves to new location
[12:19:09] <johnkpaul> or actually, .find("ui-button-text").filter(function(el){return parseInt(this.innerHTML, 10) == 2;})
[12:19:14] <johnkpaul> ^ @ Deele
[12:19:22] <tplaner_> Deele: is it possible to reference the current position?
[12:20:24] <Deele> johnkpaul, yeah, it will do the job, thx
[12:26:13] <TimTim`> ok is anyone still around lol?
[12:26:22] <Deele> yes
[12:26:22] <TimTim`> i made a jsfiddle demonstrating what i want to do
[12:26:26] <TimTim`> http://jsfiddle.net/f7nAt/
[12:30:16] <TimTim`> is the jsFiddle clear?
[12:35:38] <Whirl3d> I have no idea what you are talking about. Can you explain it in plain English:  like you want to create a plugin that you can pass the string "extend" as the first parameter on instantiation to "extend" the jquery object's existing methods with new methods defined in the second paramter?
[12:36:45] <TimTim`> it doesn't *have* to be done that way
[12:36:54] <TimTim`> that's just how i did it
[12:37:12] <TimTim`> it works as you just described
[12:37:14] <TimTim`> the problem
[12:37:18] <TimTim`> is outlined in the comments
[12:37:31] <TimTim`> $(this).basePlugin('methodToBeOverridden');
[12:37:41] <TimTim`> "It would be great if I could come up with a way to just call "methodToBeOverridden()" without getting $(this) and basePlugin."
[12:38:08] <TimTim`> so that from within the init function, it calls the proper methodToBeOverridden
[12:38:10] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do ?
[12:38:41] <Lucky--> any of you guys got a good json-php proxy?
[12:42:24] <Rev3rse> Simple question: Is there any chance that IE9 runs jQuery code better than chrome(or not even working)??
[12:44:18] <Whirl3d> TimTIm, do yo mean to override $.fn  with the plugin's new method or $. ?
[12:45:37] <TimTim`> starting to think this might be too hard to explain over irc -_-
[12:46:10] <TimTim`> the original basePlugin's methods will still remain, so they can be called if necessary
[12:46:27] <TimTim`> somePlugin will be a copy of basePlugin with some methods changed
[12:47:43] <TimTim`> but if some overridden method is called from within a non-overridden method, the non-overridden method should call the current plugin's version of that method
[12:48:26] <nFFF> sounds crazy
[12:48:33] <Whirl3d> give me a use case to make it all gel. I am close to understanding,b ut use literal terms rather than "some method'
[12:50:32] <TimTim`> ok in the fiddle i provided... in the init function of basePlugin, it calls the methodToBeOverridden, and the basePlugin's version of that method sets the html of the jquery object/elements to "bleh"
[12:50:32] <thomasmyrman> Rev3rse: very unlikely. If your script works better in IE, it's probably because of a bug :P
[12:50:57] <TimTim`> the somePlugin overrides methodToBeOverridden, but not init
[12:51:10] <nFFF> link to jsfiddle
[12:51:24] <TimTim`> http://jsfiddle.net/f7nAt/
[12:52:46] <Whirl3d> TimTIm, I think it's inconsistent logic to use "extend" to create a new plugin and then use extend again to override the methods of that plugin
[12:53:49] <TimTim`> what would you suggest doing to have the same functionality/flexibility?
[12:54:06] <TimTim`> i'm open to all suggestions :D
[12:54:13] <nFFF> That code is crazy, what does it even do :|
[12:54:22] <Whirl3d> so, you want a plugin that finds all occurences of the word "foo" in a <p> element and replaces them with "bar" ....thats your base...then you wanto be be able to clone the base plugin, extend the new plugin to find ("bar" and replace it with "foo" for example
[12:54:49] <TimTim`> that is an extremely basic use-case
[12:55:15] <TimTim`> obviously, if that's what i *actually* wanted to do, i wouldn't do that
[12:55:19] <nFFF> but why are you even extending it
[12:55:22] <TimTim`> the example i provided is just an example
[12:55:29] <Whirl3d> That's not so hard. Now what about the other notion that if something calls the original method, it uses the extended method?
[12:56:08] <nFFF> TimTim`, what are you trying to achieve with this plugin
[12:56:23] <TimTim`> it's complicated nFFF
[12:56:25] <TimTim`> lol
[12:56:36] <TimTim`> but it's a big project designed to be as extendable as possible
[12:56:46] <nFFF> No shit its complicated :D
[12:57:06] <TimTim`> i already have most of the code written, i'm just refactoring it to try to make it much more easily extendable
[12:57:31] <nFFF> but Im just so confused, are other 3rd party scripts going to be dynamically extending yours?
[12:57:50] <TimTim`> that functionality will be available
[12:58:06] <nFFF> why do you need to override functions?
[12:58:19] <TimTim`> to maximize code reuse
[12:58:27] <TimTim`> and reduce overall filesize (by a lot!)
[12:58:33] <TimTim`> also to help make things much more organized
[12:59:20] <TimTim`> for instance
[12:59:27] <TimTim`> suppose you have a really basic tooltip
[12:59:31] <TimTim`> that can be applied to any element
[12:59:31] <Whirl3d> so give an example that isn't the basic use case  that if you actually wanted to do, you wouldn't do? Lol
[12:59:46] <Whirl3d> with ya so far
[12:59:52] <TimTim`> and then you have a specialTooltip with all kinds of cool functionality
[12:59:58] <TimTim`> that builds ontop of the original tooltip
[13:00:10] <TimTim`> and maybe anotherSpecialTooltip that builds on top of the original
[13:00:13] <Whirl3d> lots of plugins offer this "plugin" functionality
[13:01:18] <nFFF> TimTim` ever heard of prototype? :<
[13:02:22] <TimTim`> lol i've already gone that route nFFF
[13:02:39] <TimTim`> but i really want it jquery style
[13:02:45] <TimTim`> for chaining, etc.
[13:03:22] <nFFF> But youd just create seperate functions of namespace 'tooltip', rather then trying to override the same one
[13:03:41] <Ziber> when using $.ajax, if my script returns a json encoded array, I can access it via data[element], right?
[13:04:18] <TimTim`> not sure what you mean nFFF
[13:04:30] <johnkpaul> Ziber: if it is an array, element needs to be an integer,but generally, yes
[13:04:43] <johnkpaul> if it returns json, and is of dataType:'json'
[13:04:55] <Ziber> I have to set some headers, don't I?
[13:04:58] <Ziber> What headers, and where?
[13:05:18] <Ziber> it needs to be an integer?
[13:05:20] <Amplifi3d> Hi guys, I need help with a jquery script called jQuery mosaic
[13:05:36] <Amplifi3d> I need the content to be responsive
[13:05:42] <gho5t> and what have you brought to offer
[13:05:51] <TimTim`> nFFF, the point of what i'm trying to do is so that i can do this: $('selector').tooltip() or $('selector').specialTooltip() $('selector').superSpecialTooltip()
[13:06:58] <TimTim`> where the special and superSpecial tooltips inherit all the basic functionality without having to duplicate it in the actual code
[13:07:05] <johnkpaul> Ziber: content type application/json
[13:07:38] <TimTim`> doing it like that also keeps things much cleaner with huge projects
[13:07:56] <Amplifi3d> http://jsfiddle.net/b3nCD/ <- Can someone tell me how to make it responsive? If I change the height to a % it pretty much doesn't work
[13:08:02] <shoky_> hai
[13:10:37] <Amplifi3d> Anyone?
[13:10:43] <johnkpaul> ?studyguide
[13:10:45] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Couldn't find "studyguide" in jQuery Docs.
[13:11:38] <nFFF> TimTim`, specialToolTip would usually just extend, toolTip
[13:13:12] <TimTim`> nFFF but what if toolTip has some function that we never want executed?
[13:13:30] <TimTim`> ...from within the special one
[13:13:45] <shoky_> Amplifi3d: make what responsive?  here's a proper fiddle btw : http://jsfiddle.net/b3nCD/1/
[13:13:54] <shoky_> more proper at least
[13:14:15] <shoky_> oh oops
[13:14:16] <nFFF> TimTim`, then create a base tooltip that all others can inherit from
[13:14:26] <Amplifi3d> shoky_: oh, thanks. I want both of the boxes to scale
[13:14:32] <TimTim`> that's what i'm trying to do!
[13:14:37] <nFFF> you said inherit all basic functionality, and then you say has functios we never eant executed
[13:14:46] <TimTim`> it could be either or
[13:14:46] <nFFF> thats conflicting
[13:14:50] <TimTim`> the point is to be flexible
[13:14:55] <nFFF> thats impossible
[13:15:04] <shoky_> Amplifi3d:  even more proper: http://jsfiddle.net/b3nCD/2/
[13:15:13] <nFFF> how are you suppose to know which methods object B inherits?
[13:15:23] <nFFF> if your saying it may or may not want some or all of the methods?
[13:15:43] <nFFF> You need to make it modular, so your class tooltip has functions all tooltips need
[13:15:50] <shoky_> Amplifi3d: you want them to scale what?
[13:15:54] <nFFF> and then extend and build upon
[13:15:57] <TimTim`> maybe i misunderstood what you meant by [16:14] <nFFF> TimTim`, then create a base tooltip that all others can inherit from
[13:16:10] <TimTim`> can you provide an example of what you meant?
[13:16:28] <gho5t> is there a formula for understanding what the current context is? e.g. $('.foo').append('<span>HI</span>') . is the context .foo or span?
[13:17:53] <Amplifi3d> shoky_: if the browser window is smaller I want the boxes to be smaller
[13:18:16] <shoky_> oh.
[13:18:54] <Amplifi3d> it scales with the width and height of the window
[13:18:55] <shoky_> that's either with CSS or with $(window).resize(...)
[13:20:26] <Amplifi3d> shoky_: yeah, tried to change the css to % but it doesn't really work
[13:20:57] <TimTim`> nFFF, what i'm trying to do is exactly what you described
[13:21:31] <nFFF> Yea moment trying to work this out
[13:26:38] <monk12> hello all, I'm looking at jquery-bbq plugin. and was curious. Can I set the hash location cross-browser easily with this plugin? When the user in my app hits a Next button, i want to dynamically pull the next question from the database from ajax. Pretend its id is question_8 and then display that question text, and then put that in the url like questionaire.html#question_8 (so if the user clicks back on question 8, he goes to the previous url #question7 and I
[13:26:38] <monk12>  can show that question which is stored in a javasript array [or just unhide it dynamically too])
[13:27:05] <nFFF> TimTim`, not sure there is any easy way :<
[13:27:54] <TimTim`> yeah there's no easy way nFFF lol
[13:28:00] <TimTim`> i mean, i have everything done
[13:28:12] <TimTim`> except for calling the methods correctly
[13:28:17] <TimTim`> from within a super class
[13:28:35] <TimTim`> if i can just get like...
[13:29:14] <TimTim`> the name of the jquery plugin from within the methods
[13:29:19] <TimTim`> i'd be set
[13:35:37] <Whirl3d> TimTIm, since you are defining the plugins, setup a closure that announces the plugins name as one of the non-overiable funtions
[13:38:32] <imachuchu> is this also the correct channel to ask jquery-ui questions?
[13:41:25] <smplstk> imachuchu: check the topic, jQuery UI is in it ;)
[13:41:40] <imachuchu> smplstk: ahh so it is, thank you
[13:42:47] <imachuchu> well then the question: is there an easy way to wrangle the autocomplete dialoge to set other data also (either to another text box or using .data to set another on the current box)
[13:43:31] <imachuchu> an example would be to search a database by a name, and then place the selected name in the typed in box along with the id in a second box
[13:45:35] <TimTim`> [16:35] <Whirl3d> TimTIm, since you are defining the plugins, setup a closure that announces the plugins name as one of the non-overiable funtions
[13:45:49] <rhizmoe> goodbye plugins.jquery.com
[13:46:01] <TimTim`> i had considered that but it won't work for the same reason
[13:46:20] <TimTim`> unless you had something different in mind than what i'm thinking
[13:47:36] <nFFF> TimTim`, have you looked into $.fn.extend(); ?
[13:49:54] <kb_oe> an interesting online comic book http://kh43.com
[13:52:23] <coldhead> this comic isn't all that interesting
[13:52:28] <ndugu> i've tried adding .slideshow { margin: 20px auto; } and .slideshow img { margin: auto; display: block }, but the pictures are still not fully centered
[13:57:13] <monk12> i figured out my question. bbq.pushState seems to be what i want. yay.
[13:57:17] <b-lew> am I setting this right? it doesn't seem to be working... http://pastie.org/3952069
[13:58:03] <b-lew> just trying to set the last li in the nav to not have a background image
[13:59:10] <Erin> hello, my website is pointstackers.com and my problem is that this jquery login works on the main page (with the junk shoutbox) http://pastebin.com/ccM1L2HE but not on this test page (new shoutbox testing) http://pointstackers.com/new.php -- can someone help me please?
[14:00:21] <shoky_> b-lew: background-image cant be set to 'transparent'
[14:00:51] <b-lew> shoky_ can i just set it to background?
[14:00:54] <b-lew> none
[14:00:56] <b-lew> i'll try that
[14:01:18] <raffp> background:none should do the trick
[14:01:19] <shoky_> yea none
[14:01:30] <shoky_> background-image: none
[14:01:56] <shoky_> background:none is pretty different
[14:02:14] <raffp> yes shoky_ my mistake
[14:02:21] <johnkpaul> Erin: you aren't invluding the fancybox plugin before you're using it
[14:03:00] <Erin> johnkpaul i dont understand...it works on the main site page but not on the new.php page
[14:04:10] <johnkpaul> Erin: it seems to be loading multiple jqueyr's
[14:04:12] <johnkpaul> jquery's*
[14:04:19] <johnkpaul> 1.4.1 and then 1.2.6
[14:04:19] <coldhead> jquerys*
[14:04:23] <johnkpaul> haha
[14:04:23] <b-lew> shoky_ thank you that worked
[14:04:31] <johnkpaul> yes, jquerys
[14:04:56] <johnkpaul> multiple files that include the code that in aggregate is named jquery
[14:05:01] <Erin> johnkpaul - yep, the shoutbox is loading a jquery from a different directory (and older version) while the main site is loading it from the root directory
[14:05:07] <Erin> do you think that's what's causing the issue?
[14:05:12] <coldhead> hahahah
[14:05:14] <johnkpaul> yes, it is overwriting your fancybox plugin
[14:05:19] <Erin> how wonderful lol
[14:05:29] <johnkpaul> is shoutbox a third party thing? Erin
[14:05:32] <Erin> thank you, ill try to fix it up, im extremely new to this
[14:05:33] <johnkpaul> if so, go yell at them
[14:05:45] <Erin> johnkpaul its a fairly barebones version lol
[14:05:52] * Erin heads back into the code
[14:08:52] <Erin> baha johnkpaul you rock dude
[14:10:23] <johnkpaul> :) anytime, Erin
[14:12:58] <ale__> Hello guys, I have this situation: http://jsfiddle.net/ArBev/ Can someone help me? The problem is on the appending, I don't know how to "go up and then go down"
[14:13:59] <johnkpaul> ?end @ale__
[14:14:00] <bot-t> ale__, .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[14:15:34] <silverwind> Eww .end :/
[14:16:06] <imsky> shut up
[14:17:53] <jedimind> ale__, http://jsfiddle.net/ArBev/1/
[14:18:35] <gho5t> how do you know what your scope will be...e.g. when using append()? Is there a method to determine this without logging it
[14:18:45] <gho5t> by method i mean in your head
[14:18:54] <johnkpaul> gho5t: "your scope"?
[14:19:13] <gho5t> yeah context
[14:19:18] <shoky_> 'this' ?
[14:19:32] <gho5t> if you do $('.foo').append('<span></span>').append('<br/>');
[14:19:40] <gho5t> am i appending <br> to the span or .foo?
[14:19:47] <shoky_> to .foo
[14:20:10] <gho5t> yeah. but is there a method i can use to know in the future?
[14:20:11] <shoky_> the original jq obj is returned when chaining. except when using filtering methods such as .filter  .find  .children  etc
[14:20:14] <jedimind> but you can just do $('.foo').append('<span><br/></span>');
[14:20:17] <gho5t> ah
[14:20:29] <gho5t> danke
[14:20:34] <jedimind> i mean, not that you should ever be appending a span with just a br in it
[14:20:38] <jedimind> because that's just horrible fucking markup
[14:20:39] <jedimind> but, yeah
[14:20:56] <gho5t> i wouldn't. that was just an example
[14:21:05] <jedimind> i figured, i just wanted to say it out loud
[14:21:05] <jedimind> :)
[14:21:09] <gho5t> : )
[14:21:31] <jedimind> also, you can use xhtml structure for append
[14:21:36] <jedimind> so .append('<div/>');
[14:21:39] <jedimind> will produce <div></div>
[14:21:45] <gho5t> i know dog
[14:21:46] <jedimind> you dont have to put the closing tag in there if you dont want to
[14:21:48] <gho5t> : )
[14:22:02] <gho5t> erase that example from your jedimind
[14:22:39] <shoky_> delayed that too long ;s
[14:22:39] <johnkpaul> $("<span/>").appendTo(".foo").append("<br/>") is wierd, but works
[14:23:13] <jedimind> gho5t, yeah no worries brother, im also saying it for other people in here
[14:23:14] <shoky_> hy jkp
[14:23:25] <johnkpaul> hey shoky_, how's it going?
[14:23:33] <shoky_> okz-ish
[14:23:36] <shoky_> sup
[14:23:54] <johnkpaul> eh, just getting ready to leave work
[14:24:05] <shoky_> ;(
[14:24:11] <shoky_> im just getting ready to make some pasta
[14:24:15] <ale__> jedimind: thanks!
[14:24:42] <johnkpaul> do you work from home, shoky_?
[14:26:41] <johnkpaul> shoky_: I guess rather than that, you're just procrastinating work in #jquery all day :)
[14:26:59] <smplstk> isn't that what everyone is doing in here?
[14:27:16] <smplstk> pretending to help/be helped for a paycheck? ;)

[14:28:08] <johnkpaul> heading out, have a good night everyone
[14:28:12] <jedimind> your potential employers would read logs from an irc channel?

[14:28:35] <jedimind> reading this chanlog would be a full time job

[14:51:43] <Erin> good lord I want to replace the default scrollbar on the jquery shoutbox with a jquery scrollbar but the task looks very daunting http://pointstackers.com/
[14:51:55] <Erin> is there any easy method to do this?
[14:52:05] <Erin> im probably reading all the wrong tutorials...
[14:56:43] <Dr-Bombay> the good lord isn't here, please leave a prayer
[14:57:25] <Erin> dear lord, i need to change the dogged scrollbar from 1992 to a jquery scrollbar from 2012, amen
[15:04:12] <ndugu> jesus christ, please help me centering my slideshow
[15:04:15] <ndugu> hallelujah
[15:04:56] <draginx> Is there *any* reason why $('inputs') would pick up old <inputs> that I've removed()'ed?
[15:06:12] <Lucky--> draginx: check your variable scope
[15:06:18] <draginx> Variable scope?
[15:06:25] <draginx> no no im not doing like var inputs = $('inputs');
[15:06:31] <draginx> im literally calling $('inputs') when I need to
[15:06:46] <Dr-Bombay> I hope your code says $('input')
[15:07:58] <draginx> it does
[15:08:01] <draginx> im just typing
[15:09:30] <Markzz> Does jquery have a base64 de/encoder?
[15:09:44] <Dr-Bombay> it does not
[15:10:06] <Markzz> websites everywhere lieing :(
[15:10:46] <Dr-Bombay> there's a plugin but you can't get it because the plugins archive is down since yesterday
[15:10:52] <Dr-Bombay> so solly
[15:10:56] <bartmax> i have Orders[] each order has items[], and items have a property isChecked (boolean). how can i now if any isChecked item is false ? plain JS object, not DOM
[15:11:10] <bartmax> using knockout if ko.utils helps.
[15:13:02] <silverwind> bartmax, if you don't care about old browsers... there's Array.prototype.every  IIRC
[15:13:23] <bartmax> mmm something with ko or jquery ?
[15:13:29] <bartmax> arraymap? grep? arrayFirst ?
[15:14:58] <silverwind> bartmax, well... I guess you could use .grep and .length
[15:15:08] <bartmax> 	? grep
[15:15:11] <lacrymology> I've got an issue. I'm loading jquery, and jqueryui, and after those a library that does jQuery(function(){ InlineOrdering.init(jQuery); }), I put a breakpoint inside that init method, and jQuery('').sortable appears as undefined, so this script fails, but after continuing loading the page, jQuery('').sortable shows the definition on the method, so.. what's going on here?
[15:16:30] <silverwind> bartmax, $.grep(items, function(item){ return !item.isChecked; }).length > 0             ?
[15:16:39] <bartmax> thanks
[15:16:54] <silverwind> I haven't tried it :/
[15:17:14] <bartmax> silverwind: how do i get to items ?
[15:17:27] <bartmax> silverwind: got orders[0].items, orders[1].items
[15:17:37] <bartmax> and i want to get all items of all orders
[15:17:45] <silverwind> bartmax, you could $.each on all orders.
[15:19:19] <Lucky--> anyone in here decent with apache
[15:19:39] <coldhead> not as good as the people in #httpd
[15:21:21] <bribroder>  /exit
[15:24:56] <Lucky--> anyone here ever use ProxyPass/ProxyPassReverse in apache?
[15:25:22] <jgautier> hey I have an api endpoint and when you do a GET it keeps the connection open and keeps streaming the data in...is there anyway to handle this with jQuery?
[15:26:22] <zoned> what happens if i try to do this: $input.blur(someFunc);  and then also  $input.once("blur", someFunc2);  then  $inputl.trigger("blur");    will someFunc and someFunc2 both be called?
[15:26:43] <silverwind> jgautier,  COMET?
[15:27:11] <jgautier> well its not polling, it just keeps the connection open and sends data down the pipe
[15:27:19] <jgautier> if i curl the url, the process stays open and data streams in
[15:28:10] <silverwind> jgautier, How do you access that data?
[15:28:32] <jgautier> its delimited by a \r\n
[15:28:46] <jgautier> json delimite by \r\n
[15:28:57] <coldhead> zoned: yes, but also try it and see
[15:28:58] <silverwind> jgautier, but if the connection never ends..
[15:29:15] <jgautier> yeah the complete event never fires
[15:29:21] <jgautier> which is why i was asking how it can work with jquery
[15:29:30] <jgautier> or plain old ajax
[15:29:42] <silverwind> jgautier, I might be wrong but it doesn't make sense to me...
[15:30:00] <silverwind> jgautier, The only time I see that if when using COMET and it works with an iframe
[15:30:22] <jgautier> well this API is meant to be hit by mobile clients, so maybe its not compatible with a browser
[15:30:24] <jgautier> but it is HTTP
[15:30:29] <jgautier> and it works with cURL
[15:32:10] <jgautier> this is exactly my problem

[15:32:49] <CAPITANO> Ciao amici di #jquery!!!
[15:33:15] <coldhead> tres bien
[15:33:26] <silverwind> Oui monsieur
[15:33:53] <coldhead> nice talking to you, CAPITANO
[15:35:48] <rodyhaddad> hey guys, I have a div with spans in it that I made sortable with jquery ui. For the sortable, I have revert: true to have a nice effect when sorting the spans. I added 	-webkit-perspective to the div, and now the revert doesn't return the span to the right position (in the animation). Anyone got an idea how to fix that?
[15:37:16] <rajkosto> hey guys, anyone know what the deal with this is ? http://i48.tinypic.com/a14mpw.png
[15:37:22] * coldhead np: god bows to math - yr kids aren't that special but i am
[15:38:09] <coldhead> rajkosto: we'd need to see the code that is triggering that
[15:38:23] <coldhead> because it obviously doesn't happen everytime anyone uses jquery anywhere
[15:39:16] <Lucky--> coldhead: line 1074 you arent initalizing your for loop variable
[15:39:21] <Lucky--> and have a dangling semicolon
[15:39:54] <rajkosto> img.load(function(){ descrimg.replaceWith($(this)); }).attr('src', data.image);
[15:39:57] <coldhead> Lucky--: a) it's not my code, b) that code is valid c) it's in jQuery
[15:40:14] <rajkosto> where var image=new Image(); var img=$(Image);
[15:40:27] <jyg> i've written a handful of plugins that are applied by running a function from a selector
[15:40:49] <coldhead> rajkosto: new Image() =/= $('<img>')
[15:40:49] <jyg> but i've seen plugins that are applied by putting a CSS class on a DOM node
[15:41:07] <coldhead> you're dealing with an image object
[15:41:08] <jyg> i haven't been able to find a tutorial that uses this second method, any pointers?
[15:41:26] <coldhead> rajkosto: you can probably just get away with img.src = 'whatever' and not use jQuery for that
[15:41:31] <rajkosto> i did do that
[15:41:37] <rajkosto> it makes it shrink when that happens for some reason
[15:41:38] <rajkosto> by like 20%
[15:41:49] <coldhead> rajkosto: or you can use $img = $('<img>') instead of new Image)
[15:41:50] <rajkosto> even if the image im applying is the same as  there was
[15:41:52] <coldhead> new Image()
[15:42:16] <Dr-Bombay> lucky: he very clearly is initializing the loop
[15:42:32] <coldhead> he OR she, that code is in jQuery
[15:42:58] <rajkosto> coldhead, k we cool now
[15:43:25] <coldhead> always, rajsy, always
[15:45:15] <Zackington> (Y) coldhead
[15:45:55] <coldhead> are you drawing pert young male buttocks at me, Zackington?
[15:46:00] <coldhead> because that's what i'm seeing
[15:50:50] <Zackington> UberNinDudes having a massive ganja party btw coldhead
[15:59:28] <TimTim`> is there a backwards extend function?
[15:59:30] <TimTim`> like
[16:00:01] <TimTim`> i want the first object to be overridden but only for keys that are not yet present
[16:00:09] <TimTim`> if not, it'd be easy enough to make lol
[16:00:18] <TimTim`> just wondering if jquery has that built in
[16:00:42] <danzik17> TimTim`: just reverse the order of your arguments?  that way the ones you want to live on, live on
[16:02:20] <TimTim`> i want the actual object to be changed though
[16:02:30] <TimTim`> er, the 2nd object
[16:02:51] <TimTim`> i guess i could do like obj2 = $.extend({}, obj1, obj2)
[16:04:14] <TimTim`> but its not nearly as elegant as $.extendNand(obj2, obj1)
[16:04:24] <TimTim`> or whatever the logic there would be for nand -_- lol
[16:04:30] <Dr-Bombay> LOL
[16:04:32] <TimTim`> i'm freakin tired
[16:04:34] <Dr-Bombay> HAHA
[16:04:41] <jyg> I can see in my chrome inspector that my jquery plugin is loaded (after the jQuery lib), but  at the point where I load it I get the "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method"  error.    http://pastebin.com/bgFgZRCA
[16:05:19] <jyg> the plugin itself gives no errors when it loads (and if I put one in there on purpose, it will show in the inspector)
[16:05:49] <jyg> oh and...    $(document).ready(function() { $('.facetapi-block').facetapiBlockMore(); });
[16:07:46] <danzik17> jyg: 1.  options isn't defined when it's used.  2.  you have  comma where you should have a period.   you should look into using JSLint or JSHint on your code, it would catch these errors
[16:09:14] <jyg> hmm i wonder why chrome didn't complain
[16:09:24] <danzik17> and your for loop isn't correct - use either .each, or a normal for loop - don't use for in over an array or array-like object.
[16:09:46] <danzik17> li isn't defined
[16:11:46] <jyg> thanks... fixing those things.
[16:12:01] <jyg> but its hard to find when the browser wont throw an error...
[16:12:23] <jyg> trying jslint
[16:12:45] <jyg> "Expected exactly one space between 'function' and '('."  ... really?
[16:13:06] <jyg> LOL
[16:13:27] <jyg> Unexpected '(space)'.
[16:13:42] <jyg> if complains either way, heh
[16:15:06] <jyg> geez i don't understand the majority of what jslint is complaining about
[16:15:51] <jyg> $.fn.facetapiBlockMore = function() {      ....   'Expected '$' at column 5, not column 3' ... what?
[16:16:10] <jyg> .fn$.facetapi...  don't think so...

[16:53:37] <shoky_> mmm dont think i feel anything about it :)
[16:53:42] <shoky_> never used one
[16:53:56] <shoky_> native scrollbars ftw
[16:53:59] <raj> yeah yo you have

[16:54:05] <rizall> i tried everything i now

[16:54:46] <shoky_> ah i meant i haven't used it when developing
[16:55:29] <raj> oh ok
[16:55:32] <raj> but what about as a user?
[16:55:50] <shoky_> rizall: i am betting no one would dare try to read your huge script
[16:56:25] <shoky_> raj: hmm when it's just a scrollbar and is not trying to be fancy (thus breaking usability imo), then i'm fine with them

[16:58:39] <shoky_> rizall: if you just paste a huge ugly php script and whine about it, you're wasting your time
[16:59:01] <raj> anyone know of jquery plugin (including jquery-ui) that will allow the native scrollbar to be replaced by a js one?
[16:59:07] <raj> without having to modify any content
[16:59:13] <ccapndave> raj: jScrollPane
[16:59:15] <rizall> ok I'm going to try to explain
[16:59:27] <ccapndave> raj: It doesn't work reliably cross browser though
[16:59:32] <raj> oh
[16:59:36] <raj> no good then =T
[16:59:40] <ccapndave> raj: But its the best there is
[16:59:45] <raj> really?
[16:59:58] <raj> better than jquery-ui slider?
[16:59:59] <ccapndave> raj: Welcome to the wonderful world of modern web development
[17:00:50] <Erin> anything I should read to get the shoutbox to scroll down to the bottom on page load, and when someone presses 'enter' or the 'send!' button on pointstackers.com?
[17:00:51] <rizall> when i click it hires hire post it but That date is the date on url but some how i have to tel the script to close popup
[17:00:54] <ccapndave> raj: That's a slider rather than a scrollbar.  jscrollpane replaces the overflow scrollbar with a custom one.
[17:01:01] <raj> k
[17:01:08] <Erin> my shoutbox is finished after i figure out how to get it to scroll to the bottom!
[17:01:12] <Erin> (big hooray)
[17:01:33] <tw2113> did you see the scrolltop thing i pulled up Erin ?
[17:01:43] <Erin> i didn't

[17:02:10] <ccapndave> raj: Well, it doesn't
[17:02:30] <raj> ccapndave, everything after IE7?
[17:02:35] <ccapndave> raj: I just had to pull it from a project because clients were reporting it not working on obscure browser versions/platforms
[17:02:37] <raj> (and including, perhaps)
[17:02:47] <raj> oh
[17:02:48] <raj> hmm
[17:03:00] <rizall> Camon man have 5 min break and have a quick look
[17:03:16] <shoky_> quick look? right
[17:03:22] <rizall> then tell me to fo
[17:03:27] <shoky_> fo.
[17:03:31] <rizall> loool
[17:03:34] <shoky_> ;)
[17:03:39] <raj> ccapndave, can I make it not shift the page's content whenever the scrollbar shows up?
[17:04:03] <shoky_> by "right" i meant "yeah right"
[17:04:31] <rizall> script can not do this alone is Beyond my knowledge
[17:04:38] <shoky_> LoL
[17:04:57] <ccapndave> raj: My heartfelt advice is to give it up and just use the normal browser scrollbars.
[17:05:05] <ccapndave> raj: Its a world of pain otherwise, and it will end up not workign
[17:05:30] <raj> ccapndave, my main quam is that the regular browser scrollbar shifts the content anytime it shows up
[17:05:51] <raj> *qualm
[17:05:51] <rizall> fm caring you will not even go and see the script lol i going to kill my self
[17:05:59] <shoky_> i looked at it
[17:06:02] <shoky_> it is horrible and monstrous
[17:06:07] <shoky_> fo :)
[17:06:12] <raj> ccapndave, and I don't want it always visible either
[17:06:24] <ccapndave> raj: overflow-y: auto should only show it when necessary
[17:06:36] <ccapndave> raj: If the browser decides to shift content I don't think there is much you can do about it
[17:06:46] <raj> isn't overflow already auto?
[17:07:06] <raj> well, the scrollbar takes up like 8 pixels or whatever, so when it shows up, it always shift like 8 pixels
[17:07:21] <raj> *it always shifts content like 8 pixels
[17:07:22] <ccapndave> raj: Are you sure its 8 pixels in every browser?
[17:07:24] <raj> which I hate
[17:07:26] <raj> no
[17:07:34] <raj> i was just throwing out a random number
[17:07:35] <ccapndave> raj: Which is why you have to just accept it
[17:07:40] <raj> and i'm sure it's different in every browser
[17:07:46] <ccapndave> raj: Did I mention welcome to the wonderful world of modern web development?
[17:07:48] <tw2113> raj overflow defaults to "visible"
[17:08:03] <raj> so what would overflow-y: auto do differently?
[17:08:25] <ccapndave> raj: AFAIK it will show the scrollbar when the height exceed the viewport
[17:08:28] <tw2113> i think that always shows the viertical scrollbar
[17:08:30] <tw2113> no matter what
[17:08:33] <raj> can I make the page compensate for the space it would take up on the right side? and when it shows up, remove that compensating area?
[17:09:09] <ccapndave> raj: Not reliably crossbrowser
[17:09:19] <ccapndave> raj: At least not without a lot of exceptions and special cases
[17:09:26] <ccapndave> raj: And even then probably not reliably crossbrowser
[17:10:01] <raj> i can't force a scrollbar in some on some div off the page, and see how much content shifts or something?
[17:10:17] <raj> and then use that to put an empty div of that width next to #wrap?
[17:10:24] <raj> hypothetically speaking
[17:10:29] <shoky_> good luck with that ;p
[17:10:36] <raj> so calculations are done to make it exact
[17:10:42] <shoky_> hypothetically you probably can
[17:10:51] <raj> shoky_, pay attention, we're soo pulling an allnighter
[17:10:56] <kodierer> scrollbar width / height?
[17:10:58] <raj> :)
[17:11:06] <raj> kodierer, that's a real thing?
[17:11:11] <raj> just need the width really
[17:11:12] <tw2113> shoky_ go to bed whenever you feel
[17:11:12] <shoky_> lol
[17:11:19] <kodierer> i have a snippet for that :)
[17:11:23] <shoky_> i'll go soon actually :|
[17:11:26] <ccapndave> raj: Give it a shot if you want, but it will be a lot of work
[17:11:27] <kodierer> i send it in priv
[17:12:01] <ccapndave> raj: After lots of trying this kind of stuff I eventually came to the conclusion that its better to just accept that browsers do their things with scrollbars (and other stuff) and not try and fight them
[17:13:10] <ccapndave> raj: Its not Flash - you gotta take what you are given and work with it
[17:15:32] <kodierer> raj you got my link?
[17:16:05] <rizall> so that means there is no one in hair ashley That is good on javascript
[17:17:06] <coldhead> if only an op were here to mute you
[17:32:25] <raj> kodierer, what link?
[17:43:07] <LakWork> http://html9responsiveboilerstrapjs.com/
[17:50:28] <TomWij> LakWork: http://W...W..W.WHAT.IS/THAT?kindOf=stuff#iDunno
[18:46:24] <Libin> is this right in doing this:                 categories: $.getJSON( "GetContractorJson",null)
[18:50:10] <CalebIO> you don't really have to put null Libin
[18:50:20] <CalebIO> the first param is the URL..
[18:51:36] <sayd> Libin: getJson is async
[18:51:41] <Libin> ok
[18:52:05] <sayd> also what is the string you're pointing it to, a url?
[18:52:15] <Libin> yes the parameter is the action method in the server
[18:52:56] <sayd> action method?
[18:53:13] <Libin> what happens it.. when it renders rather than showing the values it shows 0,1 ,2 ,3 4..
[18:53:25] <Libin> yes..mvc3
[18:53:45] <Libin> in other words its a url
[18:54:14] <sayd> ok. so in your callback is where you'd want to set categories
[18:55:24] <sayd> $.getJSON("GetContractorJson", function(data) { categories = data; })
[18:55:42] <rhizmoe> when working with keyup, how can i ignore certain keys/keycodes?
[18:55:59] <sayd> rhizmoe: return false from the handler
[18:56:03] <smplstk> rhizmoe: just look for the ones you actually want.
[18:56:26] <sayd> rhizmoe: return e.which == 13;
[18:56:34] <sayd> something like that
[18:59:39] <rhizmoe> that seems to be the doorway, thanks!
[18:59:48] <Libin> sayd : its still the same
[19:00:06] <Libin> this is how my entire script looks, if thats any helpful .. http://pastebin.com/AzrqxiSd
[19:00:13] <sayd> Libin: try /GetCon...
[19:00:24] <sayd> that url isnt really a url
[19:02:52] <sayd> Libin: http://pastebin.com/RAYh81PF
[19:03:00] <sayd> you might have to fix the url
[19:10:44] <tehOPEologist> shoky!!  :33333
[19:10:47] <tehOPEologist> you there?
[19:12:03] <sayd> anyone know a channel for jasmine help?
[19:15:25] <tehOPEologist> hm, seems shoky's away..
[19:15:44] <tehOPEologist> can someone explain to me how i can change the onclick value of an input tag WITHOUT jquery, and only using javascript?
[19:15:54] <tehOPEologist> i'm working on a homework assignment, and we can't use any libs :((
[19:16:18] <tehOPEologist> i need to change the onclick value from doIt()  to  convertString()
[19:16:26] <jrockjiggz> Formname.inputnam.value
[19:16:40] <tehOPEologist> i believe it should start with document.getElementById("submitButton")
[19:16:59] <tehOPEologist> but after that i've tried: .onclick
[19:17:02] <tehOPEologist> to no avail...
[19:17:05] <tehOPEologist> am i missing something?
[19:18:22] <sayd> tehOPEologist: .click =
[19:18:49] <tehOPEologist> isn't that jquery?
[19:19:00] <tehOPEologist> i can't use jquery :(  no libraries allowed...
[19:19:01] <sayd> i think.. i usually use .addEventListener('click', fn)
[19:19:11] <sayd> i think.. i usually use .addEventListener('click', fn, true)
[19:19:18] <tehOPEologist> (i know this is the jquery chan, just thought someone would know how to do it without the lib)
[19:19:24] <tehOPEologist> hmm lemme try that
[19:19:26] <tw2113> why not ask in ##javascript tehOPEologist
[19:19:35] <tehOPEologist> didn't realize that was a channel rofl
[19:19:36] <tehOPEologist> >_<
[19:20:38] <sayd> tehOPEologist: you had it right: .onclick = function() { console.log('goo') }
[19:21:01] <sayd> not really /right/ but sounds like what your homework is asking
[19:21:05] <Libin> sayd: sorry if i am being lame. but can i make it as a ajax method?
[19:21:06] <tehOPEologist> well...
[19:21:22] <tehOPEologist> if i do it like that i need the value itself to change to another function name
[19:21:29] <tehOPEologist> so right now it's set to doIt()
[19:21:46] <tehOPEologist> when they click the button, i want its value of onclick to change to convertString()
[19:22:13] <tw2113> so you're trying to use javascript to change the javascript function?
[19:22:14] <sayd> tehOPEologist: var oldClickHandler = input.onclick; input.onclick = function() { oldClickHandler(); convertString(); }
[19:22:49] <sayd> Libin: sure
[19:23:14] <tehOPEologist> sayd, you lost me..
[19:23:30] <sayd> $.ajax( { url: "whatever", success: createChart })
[19:24:18] <sayd> tehOPEologist: thats a aweird one
[19:24:39] <tehOPEologist> lol i'm asking #javascript..  see what they say
[19:24:53] <sayd> input.onclick = function() { this.onclick = convertString }
[19:25:15] <tehOPEologist> isn't that jquery, tho?
[19:25:20] <sayd> no
[19:25:24] <tehOPEologist> hm
[19:25:33] <sayd> what makes you think its jquery?
[19:25:40] <tehOPEologist> using this
[19:25:51] <tehOPEologist> thought you had to call the var
[19:25:55] <tehOPEologist> *shrug*
[19:26:52] <tehOPEologist> that didn't work...
[19:26:57] <tehOPEologist> document.getElementById("submitButton").onclick = function() { this.onclick = convertString };
[19:26:59] <tehOPEologist> that's what i did
[19:27:18] <tehOPEologist> http://pastebin.com/RuPiLiBs
[19:27:21] <sayd> it will only run after the next click
[19:27:22] <tehOPEologist> that's what i've got so far
[19:27:41] <tehOPEologist> i just wanted to declare the function convertString() at the top
[19:27:58] <sayd> document.getElementById("submitButton").onclick = convertString;
[19:28:09] <sayd> if you want to change it immediately
[19:28:41] <tehOPEologist> it's not doing it for me when i test it :(
[19:29:03] <tehOPEologist> i'm looking in the element window in chrome when i click it and it still says doIt()
[19:30:03] <sayd> you won't see it there
[19:30:11] <sayd> did you try clicking the button?
[19:31:05] <tehOPEologist> yeah, i clicked the button
[19:31:18] <tehOPEologist> i thought that if it changes the value when i click it, i'd see it change immediately?
[19:31:36] <eddiemonge> $("#submitButton").click(convertString)
[19:31:49] <tehOPEologist> wow
[19:31:53] <tw2113> no js libraries!
[19:31:56] <tehOPEologist> i guess it doesn't immediately update the html
[19:31:58] <tw2113> vanilla only
[19:32:06] <tehOPEologist> hmmmmmmmmmmm  why doesn't it show up?
[19:32:32] <tehOPEologist> i know when i change css style values using jquery, it updates the html in the source immediately when i do it
[19:33:10] <eddiemonge> oh, i thought this was a jquery channel
[19:33:23] <Libin> sayd : the code that u send me actually made a lot of difference.. I have just one record in my database.. so its actually showing [object object] instead of zero.. and the url is right.. coz dont net has got a routing system in place
[19:33:33] <tehOPEologist> eddiemonge, i know it is, i just didn't realize there was a #javascript chan =/
[19:33:59] <tw2113> i think i used "vanilla" right
[19:34:08] <tw2113> have you asked in there yet?
[19:36:32] <sayd> tehOPEologist: http://pastebin.com/Jv90DUR4
[19:38:00] <sayd> you'll have to figure how to get the userInput to be an int
[19:38:22] <sayd> i think .value will return a string, no?
[19:41:23] <Libin> sayd : i am getting it as object object.. how would i make it as a string?
[19:41:34] <Libin> do i use a stringfy option?
[19:42:14] <sayd> Libin: no
[19:42:28] <sayd> console .log it
[19:42:36] <sayd> see which property you need
[19:42:49] <Libin> ok
[19:43:31] <tw2113> console.log()....the best thing to come around since the last thing that was better than alert()
[19:51:58] <Libin> sayd : this is how it shows when i console it : Contractor_FirstName: "John"
[19:52:17] <Libin> so i tried using data.Contractor_FirstName
[19:52:22] <Libin> but that does not work
[19:52:33] <kelper> I am trying to create a Jquery plugin for a text area. When a user presses a key inside of the textarea, a message should be printed out to the console, but it is not. Here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/ZtuTc/
[19:54:14] <pr0ton> ok, UI question
[19:54:31] <pr0ton> i've got N people with free/busy status for a period of time
[19:55:02] <pr0ton> Is there a jquery plugin i can use that will create something like a  timeline of these events
[19:58:03] <Logikos> kelper: http://jsfiddle.net/ZtuTc/2/
[19:59:12] <kelper> Logikos: I am trying to develop a plugin for a textarea, though, so I need the format that came with the original jsfiddle
[20:00:06] <Logikos> the original jsfiddle you posted didnt have a text area and didnt even have jquery selected
[20:00:31] <Logikos> i'm no jquery expert, i don tknow how to make your original one work, i just looked up a few functions to make an even thappen on keydown in a text area
[20:00:38] <Logikos> i figured u could adapt it to your needs from there?
[20:01:34] <Logikos> now that the servers have re merged together perhaps if you repost your original question someone else may be able to help you better
[20:03:28] <sayd> jesta: cd modules/articles; git commit -am 'bump'
[20:03:41] <sayd> oops wrong c
[20:04:01] <jedimind_> question, is there some reason that when using a callback of fadeout('slow', function() { ... }); whatever is in there seems to get triggered twice
[20:07:35] <thebignoise> what is the best way to do synchronous events. i have and append and then a slideDown but it seems the slidedown sometimes finish before the append
[20:11:57] <b1lly> thebignoise you can set a timeout
[20:12:17] <b1lly> or you can create a loop to check if the element exist before you sliddown
[20:12:40] <thebignoise> b1lly: well the element is immediately created once the append start
[20:12:42] <thebignoise> starts
[20:12:53] <thebignoise> no?
[20:13:39] <b1lly> you can check to see if its fully loaded, the element
[20:14:23] <thebignoise> how do you do that?
[20:14:48] <b1lly> .load()
[20:16:23] <thebignoise> cool thanx
[20:23:31] <slb_> is there a way to reinstantiate a slider so that the slide event is called.  I have an incremental slider and want to reset it, but what happens is the slider resets, but the text that changes on the slide event remains the same
[20:27:36] <Libin> i am getting a json from server to javascript and render it in html. This is my script http://pastebin.com/nwKpg9Gk.. the first name that is have is John.. which shows in console correctly .. but in the html it stores characters to each element
[20:27:39] <Libin> any clue
[21:00:16] <tw2113> ?exists
[21:00:17] <bot-t> tw2113, jQuery.isFunction() - Determine if the argument passed is a Javascript function object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isFunction/
[21:02:44] <Libin> is there anyone familiar with datatables plugin here?
[21:57:08] <Ziber> I've just started learning JQuery and I've run into an unusual scenario, for which I can find no reason in either firebug or the error log. You can find my code at http://sandbox.liber.in/jquery/users - my problem is that when the page loads, "?username=" is appended into the URL. There is no mention of any GET request anywhere in my code, so I'm scratching my head as to why that is happening. The JS on the page still works perfectly fine, but I'm curious as to...
[21:57:14] <Ziber> the ?username= bit. Any help is most appreciated.
[21:58:32] <Ziber> And of course now, as I mention it, the problem/oddity seems to have disappeared.
[21:58:46] <Ziber> Any insight as to why that might've been happening is appreciated, though.
[22:03:55] <kaneda^> hey all, if i want to access a specific ul by id within a div by id can i do this within a click event? $('div#firstId ul#'+$(this).attr('id'))
[22:04:51] <kborchers> kaneda^: why would you need to do that? id's are unique so you can just select the ul directly by its id
[22:05:10] <kaneda^> unfortunately there may be other ul's with the same id
[22:05:53] <kborchers> kaneda^: that is wrong. don't do that. you will never get consistent results if you do that
[22:06:12] <kaneda^> i'll change it
[22:07:46] <auckland> i am using a jquery dashboard in my application... and wants to pass some data from the server.. I have got the data in the javascript now.. but having trouble assignin the json objects to variables that will build the charts
[22:08:12] <auckland> this is what i wrote: createChart(data.Contractor_FirstName);
[22:08:15] <kaneda^> weird, it says it's undefined :|
[22:09:54] <kborchers> kaneda^: use a class to identify those ul's then you could do something like $("#firstId").find(".className") or if you know that ul will be a child of the div, you could do $("#firstId > .className") or something like one of those
[22:10:32] <kaneda^> ok, ty
[22:10:32] <auckland> kborchers : any suggestions for me?
[22:10:56] <vl1234> hi hi gud morning

[22:41:53] <auckland> waigani : Kia ora
[22:50:59] <Ziber> Multi-dimensional PHP arrays dont work with JQuery's json decoder?
[22:51:35] <Cork> they do
[22:51:47] <Cork> as long as you json_encode them
[22:53:59] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"key":{"key":{"key":"value"}}}').key.key.key
[22:54:01] <bot-t> Cork: "value"
[22:55:06] <Ziber> I'll show you in a second, maybe I did it wrong.
[22:57:25] <Ziber> Sorry, fixed it and moved on, probably just made a typo.
[22:57:42] <Cork> :)
[22:59:26] <Ziber> If I use a hidden input field, will .text() work to update it?
[22:59:41] <Cork> no
[22:59:47] <Cork> ?.val @ Ziber

[23:14:07] <onats> I'm doing some server side processing on an image which is displayed onscreen. id like to overlay a grayed area with a loader icon on top of the image while its being processed. any ideas?
[23:27:53] <asdfq121> http://jsfiddle.net/qAmRG/ how would you make the sub ul clickable? but not outer li
[23:34:48] <Cork> auckland: what does your json look like?
[23:35:48] <auckland> Cork: Contractor_FirstName: John
[23:36:04] <auckland> i have just got one variable in it the object
[23:36:37] <Cork> auckland: thats not json
[23:37:10] <auckland> i mean that how it shows in console when i debug
[23:37:23] <zhan> ...
[23:37:37] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"Contractor_FirstName": "John" }').Contractor_FirstName
[23:37:38] <bot-t> Cork: "John"
[23:37:47] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('[{"Contractor_FirstName": "John" }]')[0].Contractor_FirstName
[23:37:48] <bot-t> Cork: "John"
[23:38:02] <Cork> auckland: so how you use it depends on your json structure
[23:38:42] <auckland> the json is autocreated my mvc3
[23:38:57] <auckland> is there someway i can see that?
[23:38:59] <Cork> auckland: ya, but check what the outputed string looks like
[23:39:01] <Cork> sure
[23:39:14] <auckland> console?
[23:39:21] <Cork> open the net/network tab in the browser debugger
[23:39:53] <Cork> and check the response section for the get call
[23:40:51] <Ziber> Got a JSON issue myself, Cork. Error console says "unexpected character", the PHP puts a single dimensional array into JSON ( http://pastebin.com/UK00FFV0 ), and the javascript decodes it the way I do any other piece of data ( var data = $.parseJSON(data); ). Ideas?
[23:41:19] <Ziber> http://sandbox.liber.in/jquery/users
[23:43:10] <Cork> asdfq121: you mean something like http://jsfiddle.net/qAmRG/1/ ?
[23:43:53] <Cork> Ziber: check what the server sends
[23:44:18] <Cork> Ziber: might be you have something adding a not supported character at the beginning of your response stream
[23:44:54] <Ziber> printf() vs sprintf()
[23:45:06] <auckland> cork : found it .. it looks like :      {Contractor_FirstName:John} {Contractor_FirstName:Libin}
[23:45:21] <Cork> Ziber: SQL error:
[23:45:21] <Cork> SELECT uid, email, creation_ip, creation_ts
[23:45:21] <Cork> Unknown column 'uid' in 'field list'
[23:45:27] <Cork> :)
[23:45:33] <Cork> that doens't look like json to me :D
[23:45:52] <auckland> cork  dont break my heart ..lol
[23:46:14] <Ziber> Huh.
[23:46:18] <Cork> auckland: thats still not json
[23:46:21] <Ziber> What'd you do to get that?
[23:47:01] <Cork> 1. loaded http://sandbox.liber.in/jquery/users/
[23:47:06] <auckland> then wat is it?
[23:47:10] <Cork> 2. typed "asd" in email address
[23:47:19] <Cork> 3. put focus in password
[23:47:26] <Cork> 4. checked process response
[23:47:43] <Ziber> Let me try to replicate.
[23:47:47] <Cork> auckland: its just a marked up string
[23:48:15] <Cork> auckland: json would be [{"Contractor_FirstName":"John"},{"Contractor_FirstName":"Libin"}]
[23:50:09] <auckland> Cork: Ok, at the top row it shows [{Contractor_FirstName:"John"},{Contractor_FirstName:"Libin"}]
[23:50:26] <Cork> ok
[23:50:52] <auckland> below that is shows: 0: {Contractor_FirstName:John}
[23:50:53] <Cork> auckland: what content-type does it say?
[23:50:59] <tocka> Morning guys
[23:51:03] <Cork> (http headers)
[23:51:46] <auckland> my bad reposnse was [{"Contractor_FirstName":"John"},{"Contractor_FirstName":"Libin"}]
[23:52:00] <auckland> i was looking into preview tab
[23:52:12] <Cork> k
[23:52:21] <Cork> and http header Content-Type ?
[23:52:34] <Cork> (on the response)
[23:52:37] <auckland> Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
[23:52:42] <Cork> k
[23:52:53] <Cork> then ya, data[0].Contractor_FirstName should work
[23:53:19] <Cork> or data[0]['Contractor_FirstName'] if you prefer that
[23:53:19] <auckland> but wats happening is
[23:54:07] <auckland> j sets to the first column bar, o to the second column bar, h to the third, and n to the fourth, and fifth has 4.
[23:54:35] <Cork> uh column?
[23:54:42] <auckland> but i want john to be shown in the first column bar
[23:54:51] <auckland> its dashboard
[23:55:04] <Cork> i don't follow
[23:55:26] <Cork> how does the json map to your dashboard?
[23:55:41] <auckland> i am using a highchart plugin to render a column cgart
[23:55:43] <auckland> chart
[23:56:12] <auckland> this json need to be passed on to a variable which will be used as x axis
[23:56:44] <Eshu> Hello EveryOne
