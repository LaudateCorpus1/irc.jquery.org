[00:00:05] <Cork> lenswipee: $.ajax('', { success: function(data), error: function() {}, complete: function() {} })
[00:00:41] <Cork> lenswipee: or $.ajax('').done(function(data) {}).fail(function() {}).always(function() {})
[00:00:45] <ezakimak> okdamn, is the height of footer fixed?
[00:00:47] <Cork> those two do the same thing
[00:01:16] <lenswipee> Cork: i wack the time out in complete function()?
[00:01:20] <okdamn> ezakimak: uhm nope
[00:01:36] <Cork> lenswipee: if you mean to set a timer, no
[00:01:37] <ezakimak> why does it change?
[00:01:56] <Cork> lenswipee: if you want to clear it if the connection times out, or if it success use complete
[00:01:58] <lenswipee> Cork: where i put that?
[00:02:05] <Cork> its just a timer
[00:02:11] <Cork> put it where ever you like
[00:02:17] <Cork> but not in a callback to the ajax call
[00:02:29] <okdamn> ezakimak:  it changes cause some page has less elements in footer
[00:02:40] <okdamn> anyway i can get the footer height dinamically
[00:02:49] <ezakimak> okdamn, what about use the scroll handler and compute whether it's visible?
[00:02:51] <lenswipee> you referring the call back as { success: function(data), error: function() {}, complete: function() {} }
[00:03:16] <Cork> yes, and those are the callbacks from the ajax call
[00:03:17] <okdamn> ezakimak: yes but how to compute that is visible?
[00:03:31] <Cork> if you want a static timer, it has nothing to do with the ajax call
[00:03:39] <ezakimak> $(window).height() should be the viewport height
[00:03:55] <lenswipee> Cork: what do i clear in complete function handler?
[00:04:04] <ezakimak> or innerHeight
[00:04:13] <Cork> lenswipee: the throbber you talked about
[00:04:31] <Cork> lenswipee: when complete is called the ajax call has ended, one way or another
[00:05:01] <lenswipee> Cork: reverting the ajax loader back to original icon should do in complete?
[00:05:11] <okdamn> ezakimak:  i'm using window.height but it seems the event starts before i reach footer visible
[00:05:12] <okdamn> :(
[00:05:17] <okdamn> how does is possible?
[00:05:24] <Cork> like i've said several times now; yes
[00:05:24] <lenswipee> Cork: or in sucess?
[00:05:29] <Cork> ...
[00:05:37] <xec> lol
[00:05:41] <lenswipee> ok
[00:05:50] <okdamn> ezakimak:  window.scrollY >= $(window).height()-$('.footer').height()
[00:06:12] <Cork> lenswipee: if you want the loader to keep showing if the connection fails use success, if you want it to always revert use compelt
[00:06:15] <okdamn> but is executed really much earlier
[00:06:17] <Cork> *complete
[00:06:35] <Cork> uh...
[00:06:43] <lenswipee> Cork: make sense
[00:06:47] <ezakimak> okdamn, look at the code in jq position for "center"
[00:06:54] <Cork> okdamn: why not just check if window.scrollY >= $('.footer').offset().top ?
[00:06:56] <ezakimak> what you posted looks close
[00:07:12] <ezakimak> what is offset() ?
[00:07:20] <Cork> ? api offset
[00:07:21] <b-ot> Cork: .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[00:07:24] <okdamn> Cork:  nice need to try sec
[00:07:51] <ezakimak> one other thing, is it possible that the footer isn't at the bottom of the body? (fixed height on body?)
[00:11:34] <ezakimak> you could also try this: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/viewport
[00:12:29] <lenswipee> window.setTimeout(2000).function(){ alert ("hi") }; <-- no go
[00:12:40] <Cork> uh...
[00:12:44] <Cork> that won't even parse
[00:12:57] <Cork> lenswipee: did you even read the documentation i linked to?
[00:12:58] <okdamn> ezakimak:  nope it is on bottom position relative
[00:13:02] <lenswipee> well thats a problem
[00:13:12] <okdamn> anyway i feel i fixed
[00:13:14] <okdamn> ;) thanks

[00:13:19] <b-ot> Cork: window.setTimeout - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout
[00:13:27] <ezakimak>  /)./,/
[00:13:33] <Cork> lenswipee: check the syntax there ^
[00:13:34] <lenswipee> window.setTimeout(showAlert,2000); function showAlert(){ alert ("hi") }; <-- good to go but not compact
[00:13:59] <Cork> lenswipee: so make the function inline if you prefer that
[00:14:08] <lenswipee> how i do that?
[00:14:19] <ezakimak> almost like you had it
[00:14:27] <Cork> by giveing settimeout an anonymous function
[00:14:39] <lenswipee> i was close was i
[00:14:44] <Cork> .setTimeout(function(){ alert ("hi") },2000);
[00:14:58] <Cork> removing the .
[00:15:13] <mtaran> I've noticed that $('*') returns all elements inside the document, but doesn't return document itself, so if you attached an event listener to document (deferring on some selector), then even if you do $('*').off() that listener will remain -- is there any chance this sort of gotcha could be included in the doc page for $('*')?
[00:15:18] <lenswipee> window.setTimeout(function(){ alert ("hi") },2000);
[00:15:24] <lenswipee> is this what you mean?
[00:15:53] <Cork> mtaran: is there even a doc for '*' ?
[00:16:03] <mtaran> http://api.jquery.com/all-selector/
[00:16:16] <Cork> lenswipee: you don't need to have window. there
[00:16:18] <ezakimak> isn't * just the css * selector?
[00:16:22] <Cork> yes
[00:16:36] <lenswipee> Cork: why not, was there in doc.
[00:16:46] <ezakimak> well, in html, you can't select the document either
[00:17:14] <lenswipee> works though
[00:17:18] <Cork> mtaran: the all selector isn't what needs the documentation
[00:17:28] <lenswipee> why doc has windows?
[00:17:29] <Cork> mtaran: what needs it is the $() function
[00:18:05] <Cork> mtaran: cause $('*') really is $('*', document) or $(document).find('*')
[00:18:21] <Cork> and as you're searching IN document it won't find it
[00:18:31] <mtaran> mmmm =/
[00:18:51] <Cork> bascilly $('
[00:18:54] <Cork> opps
[00:18:59] <mtaran> so there isn't a way to unbind _all_ selectors in a single call?
[00:19:10] <Cork> bascilly $('*') results in document.querySelectorAll('*')
[00:19:39] <Cork> $('*').add(document).add(window).off()
[00:19:58] <Cork> though there should be a cleaner way
[00:20:02] <lenswipee> Cork: when you do $.ajax('', function ( data ) {}; ) is that function the success function by default?
[00:20:23] <Cork> lenswipee: that's not a valid ajax call
[00:20:29] <mtaran> haha, okay, I'll take that :)
[00:20:37] <mtaran> thanks a lot for the clarification
[00:21:01] <Cork> mtaran: i meant give me a min and i should be able to cook up a call that only clears the event handlers
[00:21:10] <lenswipee> Cork: when you do $.ajax('', function ( data ){});
[00:21:13] <ezakimak> why not $('*, document, window').off() ?
[00:21:22] <mtaran> oh cool, that would be great
[00:21:30] <Cork> ezakimak: document and window isn't a dom element
[00:21:34] <ezakimak> or $(['*', document, window]).off() ?
[00:21:44] <Cork> nope
[00:21:53] <Cork> '*' isn't a dom element either :)
[00:22:08] <ezakimak> doesn't it parse it for 'special' selectors though?
[00:22:23] <Cork> no it checks if the argument is a string
[00:22:39] <Cork> if it's not it assumes it's an array of dom elements
[00:24:08] <JBreit> can anyone point me in the direction of a very good but free animated picture carousel?
[00:24:18] <ezakimak> google can
[00:24:34] <ezakimak> there's lots to choose from
[00:24:42] <JBreit> i googled not finding ones that i like from the sites I been searching
[00:24:49] <JBreit> and the ones I do like end up costing $
[00:25:01] <ezakimak> have you looked at wijmo's?
[00:25:04] <JBreit> still learning JS/JQuery or i would make my own
[00:25:12] <JBreit> didnt see that one come up in my search
[00:26:22] <lenswipee> Cork: if i use complete: function(), do i still need to set a timer to do the same thing?
[00:26:45] <Cork> only if you want to do something time based and not related to the connection
[00:28:04] <lenswipee> Cork: i guess good to do both in case connection is extremely slow or stagant?
[00:28:19] <Cork> not really
[00:28:20] <joker_89> hi, how can i use depdnent lists?
[00:28:26] <Cork> the connection will timeout after a while
[00:28:35] <joker_89> with <ul><li><a href..></a></li></ul>
[00:28:37] <lenswipee> Cork: how long is a while?
[00:28:45] <Cork> lenswipee: that depends on the timeout you set
[00:28:52] <ezakimak> joker_89, be more specific
[00:28:53] <Cork> (client or server side)
[00:29:19] <lenswipee> Cork: the timeout is set on which side?
[00:29:27] <Cork> both
[00:29:39] <joker_89> when i click one element of the list <ul> then use ajax for do a POST query and return a new second list as result
[00:29:48] <joker_89> like a button
[00:29:58] <lenswipee> Cork: ok
[00:30:37] <joker_89> is possible with only using lits ?
[00:30:40] <joker_89> lists*
[00:30:41] <ezakimak> joker_89, set a click handler on your <a>, do your $.ajax, and in the success handler modify your list
[00:31:04] <lenswipee> Cork: sorry, i use $.post() not $.ajax, is the structure the same as $.ajax('', { success: function(data), error: function() {}, complete: function() {} })
[00:31:08] <lenswipee> but now:
[00:31:13] <joker_89> but where can i put the id? ezakimak
[00:31:14] <lenswipee> $.post('', { success: function(data), error: function() {}, complete: function() {} })
[00:31:19] <ezakimak> what id?
[00:31:21] <Cork> lenswipee: no
[00:31:36] <ezakimak> lenswipee, just read the docs for the syntax
[00:31:39] <Cork> lenswipee: $.post can't take anything other then success as a callback
[00:31:39] <joker_89> in each list i have a name and a id, the id is then used for do the sleection in my db
[00:31:58] <Cork> lenswipee: but you can use delegate on it though
[00:31:59] <lenswipee> Cork: so $.post isn't that great
[00:32:17] <Cork> lenswipee: but you can use delegate on it though
[00:32:23] <ezakimak> $.post is just a simplified version of $.ajax
[00:32:37] <ezakimak> just use $.ajax. it's not hard
[00:32:41] <Cork> well it's a wrapper that sets a few defaults
[00:32:43] <joker_89> do you understand me ezakimak ?
[00:32:43] <lenswipee> more like a cut-down version
[00:33:33] <ezakimak> no, it's exactly what Cork said. it *is* $.ajax, just with some defaults set
[00:33:36] <lemonsparrow> hi I am using jquery autocomplete... I am passing a java arraylist of objects... now in my html I need to parse all the names of object from the java object arraylist and pass it to autocomplete.. how can I do it ? please help
[00:33:55] <ezakimak> java?
[00:33:57] <ezakimak> serialized how?
[00:34:16] <Cork> mtaran: looked around a bit, and it actually doesn't look like there is anyway to get a list of all event handlers
[00:34:21] <Cork> mtaran: and... that kinda sucks...
[00:34:25] <lenswipee> so it does have error and complete but it handles for you?
[00:34:30] <joker_89> how can i save and id value in my href?
[00:34:51] <ezakimak> lenswipee, $.ajax has global handlers, those will take effect for $.post
[00:35:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: why don't you just send a json array and it would all work?
[00:35:01] <ezakimak> see ajaxSetup()
[00:35:07] <mtaran> that's ok, though I sort of agree it sucks for debugging purposes
[00:35:32] <mtaran> removing all handlers is what I was after though, and I've got that covered now thanks to you :)
[00:35:47] <ezakimak> $.ajax() lets you override the handlers per-call, if you want
[00:35:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: actually I need to not just pass the array of names but also there ids.. is there a way I could pass both ?
[00:35:54] <Cork> mtaran: so ya $('*').add(document).off() is prob the cleanest one you can get away with
[00:36:11] <ezakimak> lemonsparrow, pass an array of objects
[00:36:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: its even documented on the demo page
[00:36:26] <ezakimak> [ { 'id': 1, 'name': 'foo' }, { ... } ]
[00:36:27] <Cork> ? jquery autocomplete
[00:36:30] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: yes I am pasing arraylist of objects
[00:36:32] <Cork> ?g jquery autocomplete
[00:36:33] <b-ot> Cork: Autocomplete | jQuery UI â†’ http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[00:37:05] <Cork> either that or you can use a custom format
[00:37:08] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yep
[00:37:12] * ezakimak goes back to fighting sortable
[00:37:39] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: Cork: is there a better way to go abt this rather than having to get the java object arraylist in the view and then convert it to some thing else
[00:37:52] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: this seems to be something like a hash.. ? [ { 'id': 1, 'name': 'foo' }, { ... } ]
[00:37:55] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what is java object?
[00:38:06] <Cork> json? just a text blob?
[00:38:11] <Cork> javascript object?
[00:38:14] <Cork> what?
[00:38:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html
[00:38:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: or are you saying you run a java app in the page to parse the data sent from the server?
[00:38:46] <ezakimak> lemonsparrow, i recommend learning some javascript fundamentals. 'something like a hash': yes, but not exactly, no.
[00:39:07] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that's just the data type you have server side
[00:39:12] <Cork> not what data you send
[00:39:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I have an array of objects instead of array of strings ... if it had been array of strings things would have been simple.. here since i have array of objetcs..
[00:39:56] <lemonsparrow> ezakimak: what is it then ? json ? :)
[00:40:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: yes, and are you serializing it to text or rendering it to json?
[00:40:13] <ezakimak> how are you sending this to the client? are you system.write()'ing html yourself?
[00:40:25] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it's json if it can be parsed as json, else it's just a text blob
[00:40:30] <joker_89> hi, How can i do a dependent list using <a href.. where i need an id_value and a text_value ? because <a href.. didn't have the attribute value!
[00:40:37] <noregret> how can I get the last sibling ?
[00:40:57] <Cork> joker_89: ?id_value=1&text_value=something
[00:40:57] <ezakimak> parent.elements[parent.length -1]
[00:41:04] <Cork> joker_89: you need to set it in the url
[00:41:11] <ezakimak> er parent.elements.length -1
[00:41:16] <joker_89> ok thx
[00:41:18] <Cork> siblings().last()
[00:41:28] <ezakimak> heh. much nicer.
[00:41:32] <joker_89> but the url never works
[00:41:40] <joker_89> it's only for store the value
[00:41:48] <Cork> ya?
[00:41:50] <ezakimak> so debug the url first, independent of the rest of the code
[00:41:51] <joker_89> because i will refresh a second list
[00:41:55] <Cork> joker_89: what are you trying to do?
[00:41:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ezakimak https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5458135
[00:42:00] <joker_89> a dependent list
[00:42:17] <Cork> dependent?
[00:42:29] <Cork> what does this have to do with link tagS?
[00:42:31] <Cork> *tags
[00:42:39] <joker_89> select an item <li> and then referesh a second list with the values of my database depending of the value selected
[00:42:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that is the code, you need to look at the data you generate
[00:43:09] <Cork> before you know that the code is just doomed
[00:43:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: here data is array of string
[00:43:24] <joker_89> Cork do you recoommend buttons?
[00:43:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but in the case I am discussing instead of array of string, I will get array of java objects
[00:43:46] <Cork> joker_89: you fail at explaining what dependent has to do with a click action at all
[00:44:07] <Cork> lemonsparrow: but you can't get an array of java objects
[00:44:17] <Cork> lemonsparrow: cause that would assume you could HAVE a java object
[00:44:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yes... I might need to pass something else like ezakimak suggested.. which would have both name and id of all urls.. right from the server to the view..
[00:44:44] <ezakimak> he could code an applet... badabing!
[00:44:49] <Cork> http sends text 1. so you can't send a memory structure, 2. javascript don't know java so it can't know what a java object is
[00:45:20] <joker_89> when you click an element <li> of my first <ul> list, then jquery ajax send a post request to my other file .php that do a query to my db with the item selectd and then with the results append <li> elements to my second <ul> list
[00:45:23] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so, either you send an encoded format ex. json or xml, or you just send a text blob, and if you send a text blob, its not even garanteed that it contains the data you want
[00:45:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so can I sent json ?
[00:45:49] <Cork> yes
[00:45:56] <Cork> json is what autocomplete expect
[00:46:04] <lemonsparrow> Cork: any site where I could just go through an example for json key value array ?
[00:46:10] <Cork> though you can handle xml or other structures too
[00:46:20] <ezakimak> google java json
[00:46:31] <Cork> ?g java encode array to json
[00:46:31] <b-ot> Cork: JSON for Java, Encode a JSON array - Streaming - Stack Overflow â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3700107/json-for-java-encode-a-json-array-streaming
[00:46:57] <ezakimak> is that an i'm feeling lucky result?
[00:47:00] <Cork> joker_89: and why not just have a click event on the li?
[00:47:09] <Cork> yes
[00:47:10] <Cork> :)
[00:47:16] <joker_89> i don't know that this exist
[00:47:23] <ezakimak> then he has to remember to style it w/:hover :)
[00:47:42] <Cork> joker_89: cause from the sound of it you don't have a real link to use
[00:47:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ezakimak thanks :)
[00:48:03] <joker_89> and in the li where can i set my id_value?
[00:48:06] <joker_89> in which attribute
[00:48:12] <ezakimak> joker_89, just type your url into your browser location bar and see what it returns--does that much even work yet?
[00:48:30] <ezakimak> data-myid="123"
[00:48:47] <joker_89> <li data-myid="123" > :S
[00:48:52] <ezakimak> $(theli).data('myid') -> "123"
[00:48:53] <Cork> joker_89:  $('ul').on('click', 'li', function() { var self = $(this); $.ajax('url', { data: { id: self.data('id'), text: self.data('text') } }); });
[00:49:08] <Nebros> on this page: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation am i the only one with design bug on top by download, documentation, tutorials...?
[00:49:09] <Cork> and <li data-id="1" data-text="something"></li>
[00:49:19] <joker_89> i want sometihing like this <button value="1">one</button> but with lists
[00:49:23] <joker_89> okk
[00:49:42] <Cork> joker_89: but sure you can use a button if you want it for design
[00:50:03] <Cork> (and if you bind the click on the li, don't forget tabindex="0")
[00:51:00] <joker_89> but why you put data-id and data-text
[00:51:11] <joker_89> li didnt have these attrb.
[00:51:12] <ezakimak> those just store your values
[00:51:28] <Cork> joker_89: data- is a namescope
[00:51:33] <ezakimak> data-XYZ is arbitrary, part of the html5 data
[00:51:49] <Cork> you're allowed to put anything you want on the dom element as long as you have data- infront of it
[00:52:08] <joker_89> ok, and tabindex
[00:52:10] <ezakimak> although be aware that some plugins will use some of those
[00:52:11] <joker_89> is necessary?
[00:52:32] <ezakimak> by default, tabindex shouldn't be necessary I would think
[00:52:32] <Cork> if you have click on the li, you want to be able to focus it
[00:52:37] <Cork> and tabindex="0" does that
[00:52:44] <Cork> it is if you use li
[00:52:47] <Cork> not if you use button
[00:52:55] <ezakimak> ah. not normally focused-element
[00:53:01] <Cork> yes
[00:53:12] <ezakimak> does 0 tell the browser to order normally (according to flow)
[00:53:17] <Cork> and if you bind click handlers on an element you should ALWAYS make it focusable
[00:53:47] <Cork> -1 means not in the normal tab order (but can have focus) 0 is "normal tab order"
[00:53:55] <Cork> and > 0 is specific tab order position
[00:54:01] <ezakimak> gtk
[00:54:25] <ezakimak> wait, so what does -1 do? put it last?
[00:54:32] <joker_89> where i need to put the tabindex? in each li element?
[00:54:36] <Cork> no it doesn't put it in the tab order at all
[00:54:45] <ezakimak> but still alows :focus to fire?
[00:54:52] <Cork> <li tabindex="0" data-id="1"></li>
[00:54:55] <Cork> ezakimak: yes
[00:55:01] <Cork> and you can focus it by clicking it
[00:55:06] <ezakimak> just can't tab to it
[00:55:09] <Cork> ya
[00:55:11] <joker_89> and the second li element?
[00:55:17] <joker_89> tabindex="1" ?
[00:55:18] <Cork> joker_89: same
[00:55:19] <ezakimak> what if you focus it then hit tab?
[00:55:20] <Cork> no
[00:55:21] <joker_89> ok
[00:55:39] <Cork> ezakimak: it will jump to the first element in the tab order
[00:55:48] <Cork> and not cycle back
[00:55:54] <ezakimak> ok
[00:56:03] <ezakimak> makes sense
[00:57:59] <lejocelyn> I start to understand and program more fluently in jquery, it's a real pleasure. Thanks guys 'cause you really help me when I had questions :)
[00:59:19] <lenswipee> hi, any ideas why this syntax doesn't work? see http://jsfiddle.net/HHg5d/1/
[00:59:29] <joker_89> now how can i get the li clicked?
[00:59:32] <lenswipee> when i do $.post() it works
[00:59:55] <Cork> jenone } too many after data:
[01:00:26] <Nebros> on this page: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation am i the only one with design bug on top by download, documentation, tutorials...?
[01:00:27] <Cork> joker_89: the user clicks it?
[01:00:39] <ezakimak> $.post() and $.ajax() aren't the same syntax
[01:00:42] <joker_89> yes Cork
[01:00:53] <Cork> joker_89: i meant that is how you get it clicked
[01:00:59] <Cork> or what was the question?
[01:01:06] <lenswipee> cork: care to take a look please? http://jsfiddle.net/HHg5d/1/
[01:01:11] <joker_89> how the handle the li cliecked if there is no id
[01:01:45] <Cork> lenswipee: opps wrong nick, but already answered:  } too many after data:
[01:01:50] <lenswipee> ezakimak: i change it for $.ajax() but not working bro
[01:02:00] <zan_> $("li").on("click", function() {})
[01:02:09] <Cork> lenswipee: ya, cause you're syntax is wrong
[01:02:20] <Cork> `api ajax
[01:02:21] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[01:02:22] <joker_89> but i want to restrict only the li's of my ul
[01:02:36] <ezakimak> so alter the selector accordingly
[01:02:38] <Cork> `api jquery.ajax
[01:02:39] <zan_> does your ul has id?
[01:02:39] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[01:02:40] <lenswipee> Cork: i checked it though. every { matches }
[01:02:51] <lenswipee> so i dumb founded
[01:02:53] <Cork> lenswipee: ya, but it's not what ajax expect...
[01:03:03] <Cork> rtfm
[01:03:06] <lenswipee> i copied from the examples
[01:03:17] <lenswipee> see first example
[01:03:22] <lenswipee> unless that is rubbish
[01:03:43] <Cork> lenswipee: you need to learn to read... http://jsfiddle.net/HHg5d/2/
[01:04:43] <zan_> joker_89: $("id or class of your ul").on("click", "li", function() {})
[01:05:05] <Cork> joker_89: i gave you the full handler before
[01:05:22] <Cork> <Cork> joker_89:  $('ul').on('click', 'li', function() { var self = $(this); $.ajax('url', { data: { id: self.data('id'), text: self.data('text') } }); });
[01:06:17] <joker_89> i am using jquery-1.3.2.min.js
[01:06:34] <joker_89> is a problem ?
[01:06:45] <zan_> no, shouldn't be
[01:06:51] <Cork> <Cork> joker_89:  $('ul').delegate('li', 'click', function() { var self = $(this); $.ajax({ url: 'url', data: { id: self.data('id'), text: self.data('text') } }); }); then
[01:06:58] <Cork> they syntax changes thats all
[01:07:11] <joker_89> delegate?
[01:07:15] <Cork> yes
[01:07:16] <lenswipee> $clicked = jQuery(this); <-- is their something more commonly used than this name i came up with $clicked?
[01:07:24] <Cork> `api delegate
[01:07:24] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:07:59] <Cork> lenswipee: $self, $this or just self is the common ones
[01:08:19] <lenswipee> Cork: what do you use bro?
[01:08:30] <Cork> normally just self
[01:08:53] <Cork> or target or what ever means most to the situation
[01:09:42] <lenswipee> $clicked is usually the situation :)
[01:09:52] <lenswipee> with the mouse button yeh
[01:10:16] <Cork> but it doesn't indicate that it is the element that the event is about
[01:10:50] <lenswipee> example?
[01:14:04] <joker_89> delegate is not a function Cork
[01:14:43] <Cork> ugg you're even predating delegate...
[01:14:51] <joker_89> i ahve veresion 1.3.2
[01:15:00] <joker_89> perhaps is newer
[01:15:13] <Cork> joker_89: it is delegate was added in 1.4
[01:15:30] <Cork> so you would have to do $('li').click()
[01:15:55] <joker_89> 	$("#mphase").click("li",function() ¿
[01:16:00] <Cork> no
[01:16:08] <joker_89> mphase is the ul
[01:16:15] <Cork> you can't use delegation, you need to use explicit listeners
[01:16:23] <Cork> or...
[01:18:04] <joker_89> where can i download the neewest version ?
[01:18:06] <joker_89> .min.js
[01:19:05] <ezakimak> joker_89, I suggest you increase your resourcefulness
[01:19:37] <joker_89> ok now works with 1.9.1
[01:20:24] <joker_89> thx
[01:25:16] <joker_89> and how can i change the propieties of a selected li?
[01:25:26] <joker_89> for mark as checked
[01:25:40] <Cork> properties? what properties?
[01:25:45] <joker_89> style

[01:27:42] <oleole> Hello. Is there a way where I can get all items where group_id = 2 for example in jQuery from a JSON? My JSON looks like this: http://pastebin.com/pVKghC99
[01:27:53] <oleole> Or will I have to loop through every item and check if it's the correct group id?

[01:28:59] <Cork> hmm actually, not sure if that works for objects though
[01:29:12] <ezakimak> arrayMap?
[01:29:12] <oleole> Cork: I don't think so
[01:29:34] <joker_89> Cork i do this: $(this).css("color","red"); but if i click another li how can i remove this attribute?
[01:29:34] <Cork> longbeach: why is your second level an object btw?
[01:29:47] <killer`toaster> I have a $('.intro-skip').click event inside a $(window).load... when I click the .intro-skip, the code isn't executed. Any ideas?
[01:29:59] <Cork> opps where did i get that nick from...
[01:30:02] <oleole> Cork: Haha
[01:30:06] <oleole> I get it from another source
[01:30:15] <Cork> oleole: the second level should have been an array
[01:30:30] <Cork> oleole: you're kinda screwed with objects
[01:30:35] <ezakimak> joker_89, you can't remove the color attribute, only change it.
[01:30:42] <ezakimak> adding/removing classes is the better solution
[01:30:44] <Cork> oleole: you would have to walk it manually
[01:30:58] <joker_89> but change all the li elements of a ul?
[01:31:00] <oleole> Cork: Yeah, like this, right? http://pastebin.com/SPnwdJPi
[01:31:12] <Cork> oleole: no
[01:31:18] <oleole> I also thought that I had to walk through it manually, but had just hoped there was a quick way :D
[01:31:18] <ezakimak> not for 1-based index
[01:31:41] <Cork> oleole: { "dyr": [{}, {}, {}, {}]}
[01:31:46] <oleole> Ohh
[01:31:57] <Cork> the "1": is the problem
[01:32:03] <ezakimak> joker_89, $('myul > li').css("color", "notred");
[01:32:12] <Cork> uh...
[01:32:23] <Cork> css('color', '') is the way to reset the value
[01:32:30] <ezakimak> reset to what?
[01:32:39] <oleole> Cork: Hmm.. But it's easy to loop? $.each(data.dyr........ works fine. I get the output from another PHP server/API, so can't really do much about it
[01:32:42] <Cork> to what it is without the inline style
[01:32:43] <ezakimak> does it remember a stack of values?
[01:33:07] <ezakimak> gtk
[01:33:09] <joker_89> $('#mphase > li').css("color", "notred"); ? what means >

[01:46:07] <theresajayne_> just wondering if there is an easy way to pass data from a page to a fancybox? I have been using parent.$("#myid").val() is there a nicer way
[01:50:29] <SebastianG_> I want to enlarge the clickable area with something like $(elem).click(function(){ $(this).children().click(); }); This starts an infinite loop. Any idea how to fix it?
[01:51:28] <Cork> SebastianG_: you trigger a click on a child, it bubbles to the parent and triggers the loop
[01:51:58] <Cork> SebastianG_: check if the event.target == this
[01:52:00] <SebastianG_> Cork: Yes, I understand the problem. But I don't see an esay workaorut
[01:52:04] <Cork> and only then do the fake
[01:52:08] <Cork> that should prevent it
[01:52:17] <SebastianG_> Cork: Nice and easy
[01:52:23] <SebastianG_> Thank you so much!

[02:12:00] <Eddie_> Hello everyone
[02:12:16] <Eddie_> Wondering if I could get some help with Jquery validation?
[02:14:44] <seutje> Cork: meanie :P
[02:15:08] <noregret> http://pastie.org/7715138 can someone tell me why the browser blocks teh 2nd event as a poup and doesn't for the first? even though both open new tabs
[02:16:10] <seutje> noregret: I guess it isn't considered a direct result of a user event
[02:16:24] <noregret> ah I see
[02:16:26] <noregret> makes sense
[02:17:15] <Cork> noregret: you your delaying the .open to the callback from the ajax call
[02:17:22] <Cork> so it is outside the user event
[02:17:37] <noregret> seutje: I have some html content to open in a new tab, and i'm using that method, but it looks to me that the page won't be interactive if there are some JS, is there any way around taht
[02:17:46] <noregret> Cork: yeah, i got it
[02:18:01] <Cork> noregret: you need to use window.open instead of getJSON
[02:18:12] <Cork> and open the new page from the start instead of from ajax
[02:18:19] <seutje> yeah, I'm not entirely sure what ur going for here
[02:18:44] <seutje> ur opening an empty window and filling it with the result of an ajax request?
[02:18:54] <noregret> Cork: ah, you mean open a new window, then do the ajax call and fill it up ?
[02:18:59] <seutje> no
[02:19:05] <seutje> just open a window with the url ur ajaxing
[02:19:09] <Cork> noregret: well that could work too
[02:19:32] <noregret> seutje: ah, didn't think of that
[02:19:33] <Cork> noregret: but what i meant was do the call by opening the tab, and have the server send the html instead of json
[02:19:56] <noregret> Cork: I see
[02:20:12] <lejocelyn> I don't understand, in my webpage, http://pastebin.fr/27155, I've got multiple sources for scripts, but the scripts within the script tag doesn't work, only the ones within the script tags with src
[02:20:26] <noregret> Cork: so like window.open(path) ?
[02:20:30] <Cork> yes
[02:20:37] <sl33k> does not binding a fadeout to event renders it only once?
[02:20:54] <Cork> sl33k: what?
[02:20:55] <noregret> Cork: and will the page work correctly as if it's a single html file ? since the way it is now, it's not
[02:20:59] <Cork> you can't bind fadeout at all
[02:21:10] <Cork> fadeout is a function not an event
[02:21:39] <Cork> noregret: it works if the server sends a full html page
[02:21:46] <Cork> else; no
[02:21:47] <sl33k> i mean enclosing it
[02:21:50] <noregret> cool, i'll give it a shot
[02:21:53] <noregret> thanks guys
[02:22:09] <Cork> sl33k: the fade happens when it's triggered
[02:22:38] <sl33k> I have no event. just this statement
[02:22:40] <sl33k> $('#ErrLandline').text('Please Enter Complete Landline').fadeIn(500);
[02:23:04] <Cork> sl33k: and is #ErrLandline visible already?
[02:23:13] <sl33k> Cork: no
[02:23:16] <seutje> lejocelyn: the formSubmit("form_register_academical_information");, does that function happen to be defined in form_error_display.js, form_addRemove.js or form_validation.js ?
[02:23:30] <Cork> sl33k: then the call will trigger a fade of the element
[02:23:44] <sl33k> Cork: It does not have any text before .html
[02:23:45] <sl33k> ()
[02:23:54] <Cork> what?
[02:24:05] <Cork> sl33k: can you make a fiddle about your question?
[02:24:09] <sl33k> ok

[02:25:29] <KrizOne> hi everyone, does anyone know if its possible to look for a certain element on a html5 canvas and then click that particular part of the canvas using jquery?
[02:25:59] <Cork> KrizOne: canvas don't have elements
[02:26:01] <Cork> so no
[02:26:21] <Cork> canvas is just pixels, so there is nothing there jquery can work with
[02:26:34] <KrizOne> ah ok i had a feeling that might be the case
[02:26:59] <KrizOne> is there something in jquery i can do to like take an img of the canvas and look for a certain picture within it and then click that location?
[02:27:06] <KrizOne> or is that sort of above what jquery does
[02:27:08] <Cork> lemonsparrow: are you still in java land?
[02:27:21] <lejocelyn> seutje: thanks
[02:27:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork: i have var = publishers{}; and then publishers = java_arralist.list; so that now publishers has something like {{1,"hi"},{2, "a"}} now how can I get all strings alone into a js string array from this ??
[02:27:38] <Cork> KrizOne: if you use canvas, canvas is what you got
[02:27:52] <KrizOne> Cork, okies thanks
[02:27:58] <Cork> KrizOne: there are functions to scan for pixels and things like that, but no it's not part of jquery
[02:28:07] <Cork> jquery has nothing for canvas basically (natively at least)
[02:28:26] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ask in #java
[02:28:40] <Cork> or ir might be ##java
[02:29:39] <KrizOne> Cork, any idea of some libs that might give me those functions to look for the pixels?

[02:42:08] <BryanRuiz> actually that sounds good. thanks
[02:42:16] <jeremy-> you mean spatially on the screen or siblings in the dom
[02:42:17] <oleole> The jQuery docs say that then needle in inArray can be "anything". However, I cannot use an array as an needle. Is a loop the only way to check if values in an array is in a haystack array? http://jsfiddle.net/KvfJe/

[02:44:52] <reloadz> Cork: tough time to rap my maind around your code... not that stong in jquery
[02:44:58] <jeremy-> your fiddle is too big
[02:45:03] <Clex> Is there something wrong with this trick http://pastie.org/7715231 to "style" a file input?
[02:45:11] <jeremy-> if you have a problem with validation you should create a test case that isolates the problem to something very small
[02:45:16] <Cork> reloadz: that's not jquery, it's native js
[02:45:20] <jeremy-> you would probably just work out fixing it yourself by doing that
[02:45:28] <reloadz> even bigger problem!
[02:45:29] <jeremy-> true
[02:46:29] <reloadz> Cork: so you say that i need to get rid of each?
[02:46:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/EDm2s/
[02:46:59] <Cork> reloadz: if you want them to wait for each other yes
[02:47:20] <Cork> each is sync, if you want it async, you need to delay each iteration
[02:47:58] <Cork> reloadz: and you can do it through animate too (basically the same thing
[02:48:33] <reloadz> ou! that is true!
[02:48:33] <Cork> where you do $(target).delay().fadeIn(500, function() { next(++index); });
[02:49:00] <Cork> the point is to call for the next value from when the other part is done
[02:49:06] <Cork> and not just build a long queue
[02:49:32] <Ghan> Eddie_: debug using breakpoints
[02:56:06] <Eddie_> Ghan I am trying to fighure it out but no joy, using Firebug to debug but cant see it
[02:56:38] <Ghan> i'm thinking it's just a silly typo
[02:57:00] <Ghan> the closing curlybrace is red in jsfiddle
[02:57:11] <Ghan> and you get an error that's on the last line
[02:58:46] <reloadz> Cork: why there is "undefined" on index '8'? http://jsfiddle.net/EDm2s/2/
[02:58:57] <reloadz> not 8 but 7
[02:59:20] <Cork> index >= a.length
[02:59:37] <Cork> length is the number or records, and arrays start at 0
[03:00:24] <Cork> reloadz: and yes it's my typo :P
[03:00:38] <reloadz> thx ! :0
[03:00:41] <reloadz> :)
[03:03:15] <lejocelyn> I'm not sure to understand properly inArray, example : Jquery.inArray("353", []) returns -1, no ?
[03:03:29] <Cork> yes
[03:03:37] <Cork> -1 == doesn't match
[03:03:46] <Cork> else you get the index of the match
[03:04:33] <lejocelyn> you mean if(Jquery.inArray("353", []) == -1) is false ?
[03:05:06] <lejocelyn> I though it would be true
[03:05:12] <tankblergh> Thanks, I'll ask here then. Ok, I have 3 resizable divs inside a fixed size div. My goal is to make sure that when I resize one of them, I will also resize the one of the other divs, so that the combined height remains the same. For that I have added an option to the resizable() widget reffered to as "alsoResizeReversed". This option is the same as "alsoResize", but with the resizing reversed.
[03:05:19] <Cork> uh,  if(Jquery.inArray("353", []) == -1) { alert("doesn't exist"); }
[03:05:19] <tankblergh> Now, the problem is that when I bind resizeable to the divs the properties (ex: {alsoResizeReversed: "#div2"}) are fixed, but I need my "alsoResizeReversed" property to change to another div before I start resizeing (just pulling the border). How can I change a property value of the resizable when I'm using it?
[03:07:07] <lejocelyn> Cork: weird, it doesnt work in my code http://pastebin.fr/27156
[03:07:35] <tankblergh> I mean,  can I destroy the current resizable() in "start:" and rebind with the updated property?
[03:07:35] <lejocelyn> search for : Jquery.inArray(test, institution_list) == -1
[03:07:49] <jeremy-> what jquery event can i use instead of document.ready to indicate that a form has just been resubmitted to the same url
[03:08:33] <Cork> lejocelyn: please generate a pb that can run
[03:08:41] <Cork> jsfiddle, jsbin, or similar
[03:15:07] <lejocelyn> Cork: is it ok like this : http://jsfiddle.net/NXxqA/
[03:15:50] <Cork> yup
[03:17:10] <lejocelyn> so I don't understand why if(Jquery.inArray(test, institution_list) == -1)  isn't true
[03:17:57] <Cork> except that the code isn't working...
[03:18:11] <lejocelyn> well, that's the problem actually
[03:18:13] <lejocelyn> no ?
[03:18:18] <lejocelyn> I'd like it to work
[03:18:28] <Cork> none of the event handlers are ever called
[03:18:42] <NoOova> Hello all!
[03:18:50] <NoOova> i has set of elements in jquery object
[03:19:07] <NoOova> how to compine filter and find functionality for it?
[03:19:40] <lejocelyn> Cork: (function (){})() calls them, no ?
[03:19:56] <Cork> lejocelyn: binds them yes but doesn't call them
[03:20:08] <Cork> $('.inputAdder').on('click', function(){ works btw
[03:20:19] <Cork> but the each function in it finds no elements
[03:21:07] <lejocelyn> that part works here :(
[03:21:17] <Raydiation> hi is there a way to get the first li in a scrollable ul?
[03:21:21] <Raydiation> which is visible
[03:21:24] <Cork> hmm let me reload it a bit...
[03:21:57] <Raydiation> or do i have to loop through all and check the offset
[03:22:07] <lejocelyn> the problem is really that this if(Jquery.inArray($(this).val(), institution_list) == -1) is always false
[03:22:26] <Cork> lejocelyn: its jQuery.inArray or $.inArray not Jquery
[03:22:32] <Cork> funny that i didn't see that before :)
[03:22:39] <lejocelyn> :D
[03:22:44] <lejocelyn> ah ok, thanks
[03:24:18] <lejocelyn> that's it, it's ok
[03:25:27] <NoOova> see example:http://jsfiddle.net/Fqhfr/1/

[03:31:06] <NET||abuse> hi folks,, I have a jquery ui slider on my home page, and it seems there is no way to make the jq ui version have touch draggable handles. What's my best move here? I need to make them touch draggable? Id the jquery Mobile slider widget just a better solution? How can i use just hat component without having to load too much other junk, or can the jqmobile silder ben incorporated into regular jqueyr?
[03:31:46] <NET||abuse> umm, typoo.. :)   Id == Is the jquery Mobile slider widget just a better solution?
[03:36:10] <reloadz> Cork: thx man! helped me alot :P finished code -> http://pastebin.com/X4wCeiVR
[03:37:23] <Cork> reloadz: wait, why are you doing that each loop?
[03:38:04] <reloadz> so I could make array from images that are loaded in html
[03:38:07] <theresajayne_> o/ Cork, i am trying to get an overriding text color working in JQuery but its not working, i want to change the text color on a div and all its sub text, I am trying to use $(this).css('color',textcolours[code]+' !important'); is that the right way?
[03:38:46] <reloadz> idea is to make code appicable to anny amount of images that are source for image rotation
[03:38:56] <Cork> reloadz: http://pastebin.com/zFACkGZe
[03:39:04] <reloadz> idea is to make code applicable to any amount of images that are source for image rotation
[03:39:34] <Cork> reloadz: also i'm not sure images.eq(index).load(img_src) is valid
[03:40:33] <Cork> reloadz: nope you want attr('src', img_src)
[03:41:15] <Cork> though that said, not sure what you expect to do there
[03:41:37] <reloadz> ReferenceError: a is not defined
[03:41:50] <Cork> ya, as i renamed it to images
[03:42:01] <Cork> "a" was just a placeholder
[03:42:12] <reloadz> well....
[03:42:19] <reloadz> sec...
[03:42:54] <reloadz> TypeError: i.handler.apply is not a function
[03:43:06] <Cork> from where?
[03:44:10] <reloadz> jquery....min.js (line 3)
[03:44:20] <Cork> no i meant from where in you're code
[03:44:40] <reloadz> it sas it's in jquery.... not in code...
[03:44:44] <reloadz> so i cant really tell
[03:44:52] <Cork> ya, but it is triggered in you're code
[03:45:27] <Cork> reloadz: it would help if you could make a working copy on jsfiddle
[03:46:17] <reloadz> var image_oblect = images.eq(index).load(img_src);
[03:46:25] <Cork> makes sense
[03:46:50] <reloadz> ??? also this? var img_src = images.eq(index).attr('src', img_src);
[03:46:53] <Cork> what are you trying to do there $(a[index]).load(img_src) was the old line
[03:47:45] * theresajayne_ bashes head against wall, why is color not being sorted correctly
[03:47:49] <Cork> reloadz: all i did was replace $(a[index]) with images.eq(index) the rest is all you
[03:48:53] <Cork> reloadz: the problem is i don't understand what you thought this line would do var image_oblect = $(a[index]).load(img_src);
[03:48:59] <Cork> it makes no sense to me
[03:49:26] <reloadz> ou! whate 5 min jsfiddle
[03:50:23] <Cork> i start to wonder if those two lines could just be replaced with var image_object = images.eq(index);
[03:56:05] <reloadz> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/dHmbW/
[03:59:21] <Cork> reloadz: are you trying to make a clone of the image in the nav bar?
[04:00:29] <reloadz> i read in stack overflow that u need to load image to get its actual width and height
[04:01:07] <Cork> .load doens't load the image
[04:01:34] <Cork> and it's already loaded in the navbar so the image is already loaded
[04:03:40] <Cork> reloadz: this this is somewhat what you want http://jsfiddle.net/dHmbW/1/
[04:06:05] <Cork> reloadz: and cleaned up a bit more http://jsfiddle.net/dHmbW/2/
[04:06:44] <Cork> reloadz: also you have a race condition in your code
[04:08:43] <reloadz> race condition - i need to read terminalogy....
[04:09:16] <Cork> you trigger a new loop before the old one has ended
[04:09:33] <reloadz> ok!
[04:10:44] <Cork> reloadz: http://jsfiddle.net/dHmbW/3/
[04:10:45] <lobbin> Can I do a better find for this? object.find( baseNode ).children().first().hide();
[04:10:52] <Cork> reloadz: that should be safer
[04:11:40] <Cork> lobbin: hard to say without the context, but prob not
[04:12:41] <Cork> reloadz: opps made a blooper there http://jsfiddle.net/dHmbW/4/
[04:17:32] <reloadz> Cork: thx uuuuuuuuuu!
[04:18:01] <Cork> i guess that means what's what you tried to do :)
[04:18:12] <Cork> *means that's what
[04:18:19] <ravenzz> what is the best way to go when implementing a overlay plugin? have a shared overlay container in which the content is copied or just overlay an html component?
[04:18:51] <reloadz> Cork: :D:D:D image.width() returns 0. all the time! :D
[04:18:58] <Cork> ravenzz: use z-index and be done with it?
[04:19:10] <reloadz> that is why i needed to use .load() I guess
[04:19:36] <Cork> you can't use .load for that
[04:21:15] <ravenzz> Cork maybe
[04:21:40] <Cork> reloadz: http://jsfiddle.net/dHmbW/5/ this should give you valid dimentions
[04:26:41] <reloadz> Cork: are u javascript god?
[04:26:50] <reloadz> XD
[04:26:55] <Cork> lol, no not even close
[04:27:17] <reloadz> Chuck Norris
[04:27:19] <reloadz> ?
[04:27:20] <Cork> images are rendered when you add them to the dom
[04:27:39] <Cork> so you get the dimensions after that happens
[04:27:43] <reloadz> :) again, THX!
[04:27:47] <Cork> thats why the little change helped
[04:27:53] <amcsi_work> hi
[04:28:08] <amcsi_work> how do I find out what event binds an element has?
[04:28:31] <Cork> amcsi_work: normally; you can't
[04:28:44] <Cork> thought jquery has an internal array you can dig in
[04:28:57] <Cork> but it's not officially supported
[04:29:09] <Cork> $._data(elm, 'events')
[04:29:28] <Cork> where elm is the dom element
[04:29:28] <Cork> yay a netsplit...
[04:32:11] <Ghan> haven't seen a netplit in over a decade!
[04:32:24] <JBreit> lucky you
[04:32:35] * Ghan can die happy now
[04:32:57] <amcsi_work> thanks!
[04:33:16] <ravenzz> I remember the time when you could take the opless channel thanks to netsplits
[04:33:18] <Cork> Ghan: you haven't been on freenode a lot then
[04:33:27] <ravenzz> that was on ircnet
[04:34:22] <rickibalboa> Haven't seen a netsplit in order a decade? Where have you been for the past 10 year, on a one server network, lulz
[04:34:42] <JBreit> he must not hang out on social net either heh
[04:35:29] <rickibalboa> Saying that netsplits are pretty common here on freenode these days lol.
[04:37:14] <amcsi_work> I'm having an issue with .one() and custom events
[04:37:45] <amcsi_work> even though I keep subscribing over and over again with the handler being redefined, the handler is only run once
[04:39:04] <asdfz0mg> amcsi_work why do you want to use .one()?
[04:39:37] <asdfz0mg> Sound like you're trying to run the event more than one time?
[04:41:47] <amcsi_work> yes, but I want to keep resubscribing each time
[04:41:54] <Dexx1_> So, I have a SQL database filled with "business locations" -- I want to build a search box that AUTOCOMPLETES based on city (ie: if someone starts typing L ... I want it to show the closest matching cities starting with L) any tips on implementation?
[04:42:55] <Cork> Dexx1_: what part of it?
[04:43:11] <Cork> it sounds like quite basic autocomplete functionality
[04:43:53] <Dexx1_> Cork: As a starting point, I am mainly interested in the Search box...very much like http://trulia.com (of course without as much options...try typing a city in there). right now, all I have is a nice little database I built/made
[04:44:25] <Cork> ?g jquery autocomplete

[04:44:28] <bot-t> Cork, Autocomplete | jQuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[04:47:17] <NoOova> What is "context" argument in $.parseHTML
[04:47:51] <Dexx1_> Cork: that thing does not pull from a database (AFAIK)
[04:48:13] <Cork> NoOova: its the same as $(target).html(htmlString)
[04:48:31] <Cork> Dexx1_: js can't pull from your database
[04:48:48] <Cork> it needs to talk to a backend service and talks to the database
[04:48:48] <Dexx1_> Cork: oh..so no way to do it with jQuery?
[04:49:12] <Cork> Dexx1_: no, would you honestly trust third party visitors to run sql on your server??
[04:49:38] * Cork runs drop database;
[04:50:04] <Dexx1_> Cork: no..I don't want people to "run sql" on my server....I was saying: I have a database full of specific businesses and I want it to be searchable by visitors with an autocomplete search functionality
[04:50:37] <Cork> Dexx1_: yes, and js takes the requests and sends them to a backend, that pulls the data from the database
[04:50:42] <Cork> and returns the hits to js
[04:50:51] <Aamir> Dexx1_:  have a look at this http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[04:50:55] <Aamir> this is what u want
[04:51:00] <Cork> not really
[04:51:45] <ezakimak> is there a good reference for writing widgets? I can't get my callbacks to be called with 'this' bound to the widget, even though other code i'm looking at seems to do it just fine
[04:51:47] <Dexx1_> Aamir: that looks more like it..
[04:51:58] <Cork> Dexx1_: you most likely don't want jsonp though
[04:52:10] <Cork> just normal remote pulling
[04:52:10] <NoOova> Cork: thanx!
[04:52:23] <Aamir> Dexx1_: check your inspector to see the calls. since you have db on your localhost you can just use json or xml or whatever
[04:54:44] <Dexx1_> Aamir: if it helps, my sql structure looks like this: `venues` (`id`, `name`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `phone`, `postalcode`, `addoncode`, `countyfips`, `countyname`, `latitude`, `longitude`)
[04:56:08] <Aamir> Dexx1_:  :| sÃ©lect city from table_name where city like 'SEARCH_KEYWORD%' :P
[04:57:38] <lejocelyn> is it a problem to have multiple $("button").on("click", function(){}); on a button ?
[04:58:32] <lejocelyn> I don't see why it should be a problem, but I can see why my code wouldn't work if it's a problem :)

[05:21:11] <rinkana> Hello
[05:21:52] <koneko> Hi
[05:22:01] <rinkana> I was wondering if someone had some time to help me out with an .hover issue
[05:22:38] <koneko> Just ask, maybe somebody will know the answer
[05:25:31] <rinkana> I have multiple divs with the class .comment . They have the position "absolute". When i hover on the first one the elements spread out randomly. When o go with my mouse to another div (still with the comment class) it calls the hover out function and then recalls the hover function
[05:25:49] <rinkana> Is there a way to stop it from calling the hover out
[05:27:26] <Cork> ?.mouseenter @ rinkana
[05:27:26] <bot-t> rinkana, .mouseenter(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[05:29:16] <rinkana> @Cork same issue
[05:29:52] <Cork> wait you want the out to be based on if it's of the class type?
[05:30:12] <seutje> problem is that the out isn't called when the element moves as a result of moudeover/enter?
[05:30:18] <seutje> mouseover*
[05:32:24] <rinkana> Yes, i have one main element that is always on the same location. The rest spreads out when i go over that first one. When i go outside of that main element it triggers the over out and retriggers the hover for another element with the same class
[05:32:44] <rinkana> That's the thing i want to prevent. (the retriggering and the over out)
[05:33:15] <Cork> rinkana: events work based on element and hierarchy, not css classes
[05:33:56] <Cork> rinkana: bind mouseenter on the main element, and make sure all elements are children of it, and you shouldn't get any mouseleave triggered
[05:34:24] <seutje> yeah, that
[05:36:24] <rinkana> Cork: that works. Thanks!

[06:13:42] <aaronmcadam> it's not nothing to do with possible collisions
[06:14:06] <aaronmcadam> if you put your js before the </body>, you don't need doc.ready
[06:14:47] <tarkus> how come it has nathing to do with collisions, what if $ is already taken than $(function() { .. }); won't work
[06:14:48] <aaronmcadam> and don't use the generic $ method, use $(document).ready
[06:14:58] <aaronmcadam> that's what $.noConflict is for
[06:15:11] <aaronmcadam> the method itself has nothing to do with it
[06:15:20] <tarkus> why $(document).ready is better?
[06:15:30] <aaronmcadam> it's more obvious that that's what you're doing
[06:15:37] <tarkus> right right..
[06:15:43] <tarkus> i like readability
[06:15:54] <aaronmcadam> so will your team mates
[06:32:53] <travalas> so  $(document).on('pagebeforeshow', seems to trigger on navigations, but not on initial load.  am i doing something wrong?
[06:33:24] <Rockcanon> why the jquery 1.9 can't use '$("#sex_id option[value='0']").attr("selected",true);'  ?
[06:35:18] <aaronmcadam> try .prop
[06:35:22] <aaronmcadam> ?prop @ Rockcanon
[06:35:23] <bot-t> Rockcanon, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[06:38:15] <Rockcanon> your are right
[06:38:16] <Rockcanon> your are right
[06:38:19] <Rockcanon> just i used to attr
[06:43:31] <shafox> i want to check if one class is exists in the dom then display the form . orelse not
[06:49:26] <xec> shafox: if($(".oneClass").length) { //exists }
[06:50:58] <shafox> if($('myid').length >0 ) did the trick xec :)
[06:52:15] <aaronmcadam> you don't even need the "> 0" part shafox
[06:53:18] <xec> and i don't think <myid> is an element ;)
[07:05:02] <NielsNL> hello folks, i have an issue with blocking a submit in a onsubmit event.
[07:05:02] <NielsNL> i use firebug to debug but i cant seem why the submit is executed. "
[07:05:02] <NielsNL> is there an option (jquery based or firebug based to prevent the real submit so i can see why it did commit etc?
[07:05:56] <Nebros> i do not really understand js... in this code http://jsfiddle.net/ARmbM/ is somewhere the reason, why my input field  of a form move to the right, to make free place for the error message?
[07:07:28] <texinwien> is there a channel devoted to jquery mobile?
[07:07:40] <texinwien> a public channel, I should say...
[07:15:26] <Nebros> all at sleep? ^^
[07:20:07] <didiergm> texinwien this is here - shoot your question
[07:20:15] <texinwien> NielsNL: have a look at preventDefault
[07:21:16] <texinwien> didergm: thanks - am using jquerymobile-router w/ jqm and backbone.js, so it's a little complicated.
[07:21:36] <texinwien> the problem I have is that the router isn't handling the initial page load. works after that, however.
[07:22:27] <didiergm> texinwien - sorry mate; don't know backbone - won't be of help .....
[07:23:17] <texinwien> didergm: no worries. trouble is in using different frameworks together - it can be hard to find someone who knows them all.

[08:05:06] <soc42> hey #jquery
[08:05:58] <soc42> i am building a form which has two select fields, which share the same name as i want to show/hide() one of those select boxes based on user selection
[08:07:28] <soc42> but now, the selected option value does not get transmitted
[08:07:54] <soc42> am i missing something...? any clues?
[08:08:20] <Joel> soc42: jsfiddle please.
[08:12:53] <thaifood> Can anyone tell me how to parse my json data using getJSON please  ?   http://fpaste.org/9b7Y/
[08:14:09] <BillCriswell> thaifood: response is already json data.
[08:14:24] <thaifood> right so how to loop through it please
[08:14:43] <BillCriswell> $.each or for()
[08:14:55] <thaifood> yeah no luck using each so far
[08:15:36] <BillCriswell> What do you mean by "no luck"?
[08:15:40] <BillCriswell> did you get an error?
[08:15:57] <Z3R0> thaifood what you trying to do o ?
[08:16:10] <BillCriswell> Loop through an array.
[08:16:15] <Z3R0> o.o
[08:16:17] <Joel> thaifood: jsfiddle it.
[08:16:19] <Z3R0> should be simple...
[08:16:47] <thaifood> http://fpaste.org/oLcH/  trying access the values in the JSON
[08:16:57] <Joel> thaifood: jsfiddle it.
[08:17:10] <thaifood> I get back  0[object Object]  1[object Object]
[08:17:19] <Z3R0> thaifood: http://jsfiddle.net/ELTME/
[08:17:20] <Z3R0> lol
[08:17:38] <BillCriswell> thaifood: You need to use el.v4_cidr in the each.
[08:17:41] <thaifood> mine is an assoc array
[08:17:43] <thaifood> ahhh
[08:17:43] <Z3R0> we'll need to see your code, it looks like you have an array of objects, not just a single array
[08:18:13] <BillCriswell> $.each( response, function(i,el){ console.log(el.v4_cidr); });
[08:18:50] <thaifood> BillCriswell,  that works,  thanks very much
[08:18:56] <BillCriswell> thaifood: No problem.
[08:18:58] <thaifood> i needed the index
[08:19:16] * thaifood sends karma to the entire channell !
[08:22:29] * jo_ receives karma from thaifood.
[08:22:34] <jo_> What's the current karma -> epenis conversion rate?
[08:22:40] <jo_> *exchange rate
[08:23:04] <thaifood> you get 1000000000000 bitcoins
[08:23:07] <Z3R0> .00000001 > 1
[08:23:10] <Z3R0> lol
[08:23:22] <Z3R0> other way around
[08:23:26] <Z3R0> 1 > .00000001
[08:23:29] <BillCriswell> ..... epenis?
[08:23:32] <jo_> Worth it.
[08:23:38] <Z3R0> lol BillCriswell yea epenis
[08:23:38] <thaifood> Is this the best way to add options to my select drop down ?   $("#cidrs").append(new Option(el.v4_cidr, el.v4_cidr));
[08:23:53] <Z3R0> ThaiBoi12 no?
[08:24:07] <jo_> @bill There's a hyphen after the 'e', but I didn't want to risk getting booted from the channel?
[08:24:09] <Z3R0> best way would be to create an array and then append all at once :0
[08:24:16] <Z3R0> rather than appending every itteration
[08:24:29] <thaifood> ahh
[08:24:29] <soc42> hey Joel: here it is... http://jsfiddle.net/CFMH8/6/
[08:25:00] <superphly> Can I use the $(tag.class) on an unrendered string? I've got a blob of HTML that I'm parsing from an external feed that I need to extract just a single tag/attribute.
[08:25:09] <shafox> basically what i want is to show the form if there is some value in the text fields otherwise no. i am doing like this if ($('input:text').val().length == 0) {
[08:25:10] <shafox>           $("#registerform").hide();
[08:25:10] <shafox>         }
[08:25:26] <superphly> I feel stupid rendering the html, extracting, then destroying it.
[08:25:41] <mobile8> hi, i want to close a div when outside that div is clicked
[08:25:45] <sifu_work> hello folks...i am trying to show/hide a dropdown based on checkbox selection...can do show but after that i cannot even uncheck the checkbox...anyone have any sugeestions what i am doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/Mk6mu/1/
[08:25:45] <mobile8> how can i accomplish this best?
[08:25:56] <Z3R0> jesus christ
[08:26:03] <Z3R0> #jquery just became flooded with problems
[08:26:09] <superphly> Z3R0: haha, i'm laughing too.
[08:26:23] <Z3R0> it's usually quite dead in here
[08:26:24] <sifu_work> when it rains, it pours ;p
[08:26:24] <Joel> soc42: you get no value, or the wrong value?
[08:26:31] <soc42> Joel: now the problem is, after submit the form receives no value from the last selected select name="selectbox"
[08:26:45] <Z3R0> sifu_work use toggle ?
[08:26:48] <Joel> soc42: right, because you have two named the same thing, doesn't work that way :)
[08:26:52] <BillCriswell> $('select').append( $.map( response, function(){ return '<option>' + this.v4_cidr + '</option>').join('') ); myabe
[08:27:12] <Joel> soc42: you want both values on the second select, or only one?
[08:27:14] <Z3R0> BillCriswell I find it's better to create a string of options then append at the end
[08:27:25] <Z3R0> rather than appending each iteration of the loop
[08:27:33] <BillCriswell> Tht's what I did I thought.
[08:27:45] <Z3R0> ah
[08:27:49] <Z3R0> yea
[08:27:51] <sifu_work> Z3R0, erm but it was suggested to use .prop
[08:27:52] <shoky> note:  $.map  doesn't set 'this'
[08:27:54] <soc42> Joel: i want the last selected option value from the bottom select box
[08:28:12] <Joel> soc42: if you're only expecting one value, but not getting it from the second select, give each select a unique id, and delete the select you don't need when submit is clicked.
[08:28:13] <BillCriswell> Ah, crap.
[08:28:16] <Z3R0> sifu_work so you trying to hide the one below ?
[08:28:21] <sifu_work> yes sir
[08:28:22] <Joel> soc42: if you want both values, you need to name them differently.
[08:28:27] <BillCriswell> $('select').append( $.map( response, function(el){ return '<option>' + el.v4_cidr + '</option>').join('') );
[08:28:35] <soc42> Joel: i only want one value
[08:28:49] <Joel> soc42: so you need an onclick on submit to delete the one you don't need.
[08:28:54] <Z3R0> you're select doesn't even hide on init
[08:29:43] <sifu_work> Z3R0, erm..#dropoff hides on load...shows on check but i can't even uncheck....
[08:29:46] <Joel> soc42: make sense?
[08:29:55] <sifu_work> that code was supposed to hide toggle it
[08:30:06] <thaifood> hmm missing ; somwhere
[08:30:12] <Hello9> Wanted to share a new programming forum: http://thedevshed.net/forum/
[08:30:16] <Z3R0> nothing in that fiddle hides on load...
[08:30:39] <sifu_work> Z3R0, that is weird...let me share it again...
[08:30:51] <thaifood> firebug says  '</option>').   has a missing  ;
[08:30:52] <soc42> Joel: mmhhh... adding an unique id to both of the dependable selectboxes does not make a difference...
[08:30:53] <theresajayne_> sifu i havent seen the fiddle but i have a toggleable section
[08:31:06] <Joel> soc42: you're not listening :)
[08:31:06] <thaifood> ah }
[08:31:14] <theresajayne_> i show one on load and one on toggle
[08:31:24] <Joel> soc42:  you need to physically drop the select you don't need from the DOM, so it doesn't get submitted with the form.
[08:31:25] <BillCriswell> thaifood: Yeah, missed it before the ) of $.map().
[08:31:33] <sifu_work> theresajayne_, would be great if i could see it
[08:31:44] <theresajayne_> hang on let me get a gist up
[08:32:07] <sifu_work> okey thank you
[08:32:14] <thaifood> hmm  what's  missing ?
[08:32:32] <sifu_work> Z3R0, http://jsfiddle.net/Mk6mu/3/ (the 2nd dropdown is hidden)
[08:32:40] <soc42> Joel: so i need to identify which selectbox is active while hitting submit, right?
[08:32:48] <BillCriswell> thaifood: $.map( response, function(item){ return '<option>' + item.name + '</option>' }).join(''); would be it
[08:32:52] <Joel> soc42: correct, and remove inactive selects.
[08:33:10] <soc42> Joel: then .detach() all inactive, right?
[08:33:47] <BillCriswell> errr.. .name would be .c4-i9i39 or whatever you had.
[08:34:19] <mobile8> hi, i want to close a div when outside that div is clicked
[08:34:19] <mobile8> how can i accomplish this best?
[08:34:51] <Joel> soc42: http://jsfiddle.net/CFMH8/6/
[08:35:32] <jo_> mobile8: Are you using pure jQuery, or jQuery Mobile/jQuery UI?
[08:35:44] <Joel> soc42: that code is very dirty, because it has hardcoded id's, which is NONO.
[08:36:05] <Joel> soc42: you could also call remove on the div's instead of the selects and be fine, I just wanted it to be VERY clear what I was doing
[08:36:58] <mobile8> pure jqueyr jo
[08:37:19] <Z3R0> sifu_work: http://jsfiddle.net/Mk6mu/4/ // works
[08:37:54] <sifu_work> Z3R0, thank you kind sire
[08:38:09] <soc42> Joel: what about using "selects[]" as name?
[08:38:17] <Joel> soc42: you could do that, yes.
[08:38:28] <Joel> depending on the back end language.
[08:38:39] <soc42> Joel: its PHP
[08:38:40] <jo_> @mobile8 I would bind a function to the document mouse up.  Check if your div has the event target in it.  If not, hide it.
[08:38:52] <Joel> soc42: haven't done php in years :)
[08:39:54] <soc42> Joel: just a project requirement â€“ was not my choice ;o)
[08:40:09] <Joel> soc42: not bashing, just haven't used it in a long time.
[08:40:28] <jo_> $(document).mouseup(function(e) { if($("myContainer").has(e.target) === 0) { $("myContainer").hide(); } });
[08:40:32] <jo_> @mobile8
[08:40:51] <thaifood> BillCriswell, that gave me the drop down populated multiple times  http://fpaste.org/H3qH/
[08:41:21] <BillCriswell> Don't need to do it in the each.
[08:41:27] <thaifood> ahh
[08:41:42] <thaifood> so where will it get item from ?
[08:41:55] <BillCriswell> response
[08:41:56] <thaifood> or should that be response
[08:41:59] <thaifood> thx
[08:42:11] <maxmoore14> anyone know where the documentation for jqmData is on the new site?
[08:42:55] <unsane1> am I missing something on jquery custom builds, I'm getting an abort, with no actual warnings, see: https://gist.github.com/whoughton/5460731
[08:43:10] <thaifood> that worked,  woot, thx
[08:44:00] <mobile8> jo_: i already tried this
[08:44:00] <jo_> Has anyone stepped into/through code which is loaded with jQuery's $.getScript?
[08:44:08] <jo_> :( No good?
[08:44:56] <Wamer> how do you horizontaly center something that has position absolute?
[08:46:10] <mobile8> no
[08:46:17] <unsane1> have to do it via manual calculations Wamer
[08:48:42] <theresajayne_> sifu_work you still there
[08:48:53] <sifu_work> yes i am
[08:48:56] <theresajayne_> sorry was called away for tech call on skype
[08:49:13] <sifu_work> ahh no prob
[08:49:26] <sifu_work> Z3R0 solved it for me though
[08:50:24] <theresajayne_> https://gist.github.com/theresajayne/5460805
[08:50:30] <theresajayne_> thats roughly how i do it
[08:51:00] <sifu_work> okey thank you will have a look
[08:51:34] <nicetry> Hey guys, I'm looking for the best way to watch/trigger an action when a div's height has been changed.  There are things users can do that can change the height which I can't monitor, but I need to know when the height has changed.  I've tried http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/ but it's 3 years old not working when I try to implment it.  Any ideas?
[08:52:10] <jo_> Nicetry: I think you can bind to a window resize.
[08:52:18] <jo_> If you remember the width, you can check when the height has changed.
[08:52:37] <jo_> Looks like jQuery has it internally.
[08:52:48] <nicetry> jo_: The thing is, this has nothing to do with the window height
[08:52:59] <jo_> Oh!  Whoops.
[08:53:23] <unsane1> well, what events trigger the resize?
[08:53:27] <unsane1> can you not just also bind ot them?
[08:53:41] <nicetry> nope, they're things that are loaded dynamically from older code
[08:53:52] <nicetry> buttons that add tables or ajax in some text
[08:54:03] <nicetry> way to many to search out all of them
[08:54:21] <nicetry> so I'm trying to attack it on the level of 'has the height of this containing div changed'
[08:55:05] <Andy1991> Does anyone know how I can stop an absolute positioned child element added during an event from interrupting the event (it's ipad ongesturechange)
[08:55:06] <unsane1> have you tried adding an on.('resize', â€¦) handler?
[08:55:12] <maxmoore14> what is the best practice (or is there a difference) between $('div').data('foo-bar') and $('div').data('fooBar')
[08:55:14] <unsane1> no clue if it will work on elements, but it seems like it should
[08:55:46] <nicetry> unsane1:  Iit seems like it should, but it only works ont he window
[08:56:12] <unsane1> ah yes
[08:56:17] <unsane1> clicking a page further in the docs does show that
[08:56:20] <unsane1> as I somewhat expected
[08:56:33] <shafox> why my form is rendering a #shadow-root ??
[08:56:42] <GreatPotato> Can anyone recommend any lazy loading plugins?
[08:57:07] <nicetry> yar, it seems crazy to me that this isn't something that is more commonly needed/created by the community already, benalman aside as the last version he supported was 1.4.1
[08:58:11] <troessner> i am loading 3 files (no other js) in this exact order: jquery-1.7.2.min.js, select2.js and functions.js
[08:58:25] <troessner> where functions.js only contains: $(function() { $("#dummy").select2();});
[08:58:43] <troessner> and i get: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'select2'
[08:59:01] <troessner> from line 1 in functions.js
[08:59:11] <troessner> i have no idea how to debug this further
[08:59:13] <troessner> any ideas?
[08:59:33] <nicetry> troessner: make a jsfiddle of it?
[09:00:51] <troessner> nicetry, ah, i didn't know that
[09:01:31] <mobile8> hi, i want to close a div when outside that div is clicked
[09:01:33] <mobile8> how can i accomplish this best?
[09:02:43] <vladikoff> mobile8, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1403615/use-jquery-to-hide-a-div-when-the-user-clicks-outside-of-it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-to-detect-a-click-outside-an-element look into these
[09:02:45] <thinkt4nk> set a click handler on document, calculate bounds of div, and compare with position of click
[09:02:56] <thinkt4nk> that's how I typically do it
[09:03:01] <pachet> if it's okay that the click doesnt do anything
[09:03:13] <pachet> (eg if they click outside on a link, the click doesnt activate the link, only closes the modal)
[09:03:30] <pachet> then create a dummy screen behind the div that occupies the whole screen and listen for clicks on that
[09:03:49] <mobile8> vladikoff: thing is i have it working
[09:03:58] <mobile8> only the overlay part hides also when i click INSIDE the div
[09:03:59] <thinkt4nk> lol
[09:04:13] <mobile8> thinkt4nk: do you have any example?
[09:04:25] <thinkt4nk> nothing I can share, sorry
[09:05:54] <troessner> nicetry, when i select jquery 1.7.2 and enter the select2 raw js file as an external resource directly from github and put the select2 call in the "javascript" window everything works
[09:05:56] <troessner> fuck
[09:06:02] <troessner> so where does that leave me?
[09:06:13] <troessner> apparently my system is borked somehow
[09:06:20] <troessner> if I only knew how
[09:06:34] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ troessner
[09:06:52] <nicetry> troessner: You probably have something else wrong further up in your code.  Start with nothing, just what you put into jsfiddle, then start commenting stuff in until it breaks again
[09:07:09] <nicetry> Then you'll know whats borking your thang
[09:07:12] <troessner> thanks NoiseEee nicetry i'll give it a shot
[09:07:15] <troessner> :-/
[09:08:05] <troessner> lol
[09:08:08] <troessner> i'm a moron
[09:08:41] <troessner> NoiseEee, nicetry found the error, i've got a rails app and i didn't clear the, uhm, asset pipeline
[09:08:47] <troessner> hence old js stuck around
[09:08:57] <nicetry> troessner: there you go
[09:09:15] <troessner> thanks @ nicetry, your jsfiddle tip actually tipped me in the right direction
[09:09:25] <troessner> and i only wasted 2 damn hours
[09:09:27] <nicetry> troessner: np :)
[09:10:01] <nicetry> ugh!!! it's like every stackoverflow thread and their moms all just point to gd Ben Alman's 3 year old resize code! It can't be that i'm the first person to want this since jquery 1.4.1...grrrr
[09:11:04] <bongjovi> Would anybody be able to tell me if there is a plugin or resource that would help me learn how to replicate this kind of scrolling: http://severafrahm.com/work/portrait_brooches ?
[09:11:27] <bongjovi> Or even what that kind of thing is referred to so I can google. Thanks.
[09:12:08] <nicetry> oh great! thanks stackoverflow! point to a solution from 2008!!! its only FIVE YEARS AGO, should still work right? http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2008/Sep/12/jQuery-CSS-Property-Monitoring-Plugin-updated
[09:12:22] <bongjovi> Another example: http://www.yesstudio.co.uk/
[09:14:00] <Nancy2012> i have many articles(each one has its own div id) on my single pageâ€¦.So what i want is to whenever i do refresh or access it from another page.. it would take me to specific div ..
[09:14:10] <Nancy2012> is it possible to handle it in jquery
[09:14:11] <Nancy2012> ??
[09:15:15] <drakythe> I have a real newbie question, I have a Highcharts polar graph with 8 data points, one of which is the average. I cannot seem to get a toFixed function to work anywhere to make the average not uber long after the decimal point. http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/afX3p/
[09:16:25] <bongjovi> Nancy2012, http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[09:17:33] <Wamer> hi, can you guys tell me how do i sliding effect like this: http://cl.ly/image/3K28353M2m1A -> http://cl.ly/image/2i2A0X3l3Q1F .. the image is background of div
[09:18:56] <microhxo> How do i execute a location.href = change?
[09:19:01] <Z3R0> just like that ?
[09:19:07] <Z3R0> location.href = 'url';
[09:19:17] <microhxo> I did that and it is doing nothing
[09:19:18] <microhxo> lol
[09:19:24] <Z3R0> try window.location.href = 'url';
[09:23:10] <theresajayne_> Wamer what exactly are you trying to do?
[09:23:21] <Wamer> slide it out
[09:23:29] <Wamer> and back but leaving a little out
[09:23:45] <Wamer> as you can see that semi-transparent line
[09:23:56] <Wamer> on hover over the image btw
[09:24:39] <Wamer> mouseenter = slide in
[09:24:47] <Wamer> mouseleave = slide out
[09:25:19] <bongjovi> Can anyone tell me what this kind of scrolling is referred to as so I can google/find resources? http://www.yesstudio.co.uk/
[09:28:10] <unsane1> drakythe, toFixed returns a string, so you'll have to convert it back to a decimal
[09:28:31] <unsane1> try parseFloat
[09:28:50] <drakythe> unsane1: ah, okay. That makes sense. I think I've discovered that Math.floor will work because I don't think this actually requires showing the decimal
[09:29:05] <drakythe> unsane1: but I did not realize that toFixed returned a string, thats good to know
[09:29:29] <unsane1> try to always use your base when using parseInt too
[09:29:38] <unsane1> parseInt("24876542", 10)
[09:30:09] <drakythe> unsane1: oh? I didn't realize you could parse ints in a different base system... thats... interesting
[09:30:16] <unsane1> http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/afX3p/ works for me
[09:31:23] <unsane1> maybe not...
[09:32:11] <unsane1> oops, shouldn't be i+1
[09:32:37] <unsane1> oh did it save anyhow?
[09:32:40] <unsane1> sill fiddles
[09:33:08] <unsane1> correct the i+1, but no clue if it is saving
[09:33:13] <unsane1> *corrected
[09:33:18] <unsane1> damn my typing is horrid today
[09:33:34] <unsane1> maybe this: http://jsfiddle.net/afX3p/3/
[09:34:01] <microhxo> yea, window.location.href = 'url'; seems to do nothing when called on the success of my ajax.
[09:34:19] <microhxo> never redirects
[09:34:28] <microhxo> no errors, just nothing happens.
[09:34:41] <microhxo> When i call it using firebug console it works fine though.
[09:35:28] <unsane1> are you sure the success method is executing?
[09:35:39] <microhxo> Yea, i have a dialog close on success, that fires fine.
[09:37:13] <Wamer> how can i show custom dialog?
[09:38:24] <mm00> Hey guys! Does someone have any idea how could I solve a problem with overlapped ui sortables? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16220103/jquery-ui-sortable-and-draggable-with-overlapping-containers
[09:46:57] <bongjovi> Can anyone tell me what this kind of scrolling is referred to as so I can google/find resources? http://www.yesstudio.co.uk/
[09:48:20] <unsane1> bongjovi it isn't parallex scrolling, but that may be the best thing for you to search on
[09:49:17] <BillCriswell> Seems pretty damn annoying.
[09:49:56] <menikmati> anyone looking for work? I need something done :) (paying job)
[09:51:20] <Wamer> guys, can anyone help me show custom dialog?
[09:51:23] <drager> I'm trying to make a dropdown menu; http://jsfiddle.net/u62TK/ I have successed but if you check the link I want it to "go over" the blue box and not push it down. And I want the dropdown to be wider if there's that long content (check link). This is a CSS question but yeah
[09:51:42] <BillCriswell> drager: position: absolute;
[09:51:49] <bongjovi> unsane1, thanks, I'll have a look at that.
[09:52:01] <drager> BillCriswell: ;)
[09:52:06] <drager> thank you sir!
[09:52:11] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.
[09:52:18] <mpholt> Hi all, I am using $('selector of input box').val('text') to change the value of an input box. I want a function/event to fire after the value has been entered, but having trouble with identifying how to do that... my understanding is that .change() does not fire on programmatic changes, but only user input
[09:52:26] <mpholt> Does anyone have any tips on how to do that?
[09:52:34] <ravenzz> menikmati ask #css-lance
[09:52:46] <BillCriswell> mpholt: $('input').val('text').trigger('change')
[09:53:30] <mpholt> ohh ok... thank you BillCriswell.. sorry I missed that !
[09:53:47] <Mottie> bongjovi: it looks like custom code... it's all in this file: http://www.yesstudio.co.uk/js/projects.js
[09:53:49] <BillCriswell> mpholt: It's no trouble at all.
[09:53:59] <mpholt> thanks :)
[09:54:13] <BillCriswell> Seems like an awful lot of code to screw up scrolling lol
[09:54:20] <Mottie> lol
[09:54:25] <jop008> any help on creating a table dynamicly?
[09:56:08] <jop008> target = mobile device
[09:56:28] <Mottie> jop008: $('<table>').appendTo('body'); works
[09:56:43] <jop008> okay thx
[09:57:44] <jop008> this also (function() {
[09:57:45] <jop008>    var myTable = $('<table></table>');
[09:57:45] <Mottie> jop008: LOL I was being facetious... what are you trying to do? What are you starting with?
[09:57:46] <jop008>    $('body').append(myTable);
[09:57:47] <jop008>    myTable.html('<thead></thead><tbody></tbody>');
[09:57:48] <jop008> })();
[09:57:58] <brombomb-w> Can anyone help me smooth the animation of this box? http://jsfiddle.net/brombomb/gCywL/
[09:58:03] <jop008> create a table :-)
[09:59:05] <Mottie> jop008: you can string it all together too... var tbl = "<table><thead></thead><tbody></tbody></table>"; $(tbl).appendTo('body');
[09:59:43] <jop008> okay and then adding the rows to the table
[10:00:06] <Mottie> add them all at once, it's the fastest way
[10:01:01] <chase-work> for anyone who has used highstocks and highcharts, is there any main differences between the two? The cost of the two are considerably different
[10:05:10] <mpholt> heading out for now.. thanks again!
[10:05:24] <drager> BillCriswell: I want to change to light theme if pressing the light anchor and dark for dark; http://jsfiddle.net/u62TK/1/
[10:07:56] <intergalactic> trying to inspect rdio.com album viewer.
[10:09:35] <intergalactic> set breakpoint on mouse hover. using chrome-canary
[10:10:44] <intergalactic> it breaks on code in jquery.min
[10:12:06] <intergalactic> what appears to be in the middle of some code segment.
[10:12:18] <Zero1_AL> zero
[10:12:46] <BillCriswell> drager: Hmm.
[10:13:01] <intergalactic> i guess first question. how do i show the unmin code in chrome
[10:13:11] <intergalactic> where it is breaking
[10:13:23] <intergalactic> and how are they doing the viewer.
[10:13:27] <drager> BillCriswell: If you understand what I want?
[10:15:23] <sifu_work> i don't know if this is a rather stupid question but basically i have got a page with 5 items...they are dynamically generated and currently all have same ids...there is button to hide/show descriptions...but when i click on one...descriptions for all of the items is hidden or shown...how would i do it for just one item...
[10:16:28] <cgcardona> instead of having them all share the same id make the id unique to each element. Then you can hook into that id with the click event.
[10:16:47] <sifu_work> yes managed to get the unique id as well
[10:17:10] <sifu_work> but no idea what i would do in jquery to do it so that on the click event an unique id is selected
[10:17:28] <cgcardona> use event delegation
[10:17:45] <cgcardona> in other words bind the parent of all the items to the click event. Then when the click happens you can see which child it came from.
[10:19:06] <BillCriswell> drager: http://staging.intuitsolutions.net/switch/ cleanest example I could give you.
[10:19:11] <sifu_work> cgcardona, any examples/reading i can do...srry javascript is hard for me...and being new to it doesn't help
[10:19:59] <cgcardona> I would just google around for jquery/javascript event delegation. It's pretty easy and I'm sure there are plenty of tutorials with sample code.
[10:20:12] <nicetry> If I use http://api.jquery.com/scroll/ to bind an event handler to the scroll js event, how do I unbind it when I'm done?
[10:21:11] <sifu_work> cgardona thanks will have a look around
[10:22:00] <nicetry> actually just got it- I had a typo
[10:22:01] <BillCriswell> nicetry: $el.on('scroll', function(){ /* I'll do this for every scroll event on $el */ }); /* Do this when you want to stop doing things when you scroll */ $el.off('scroll')
[10:22:12] <nicetry> Thanks BillCriswell
[10:22:13] <drager> BillCriswell: hm
[10:22:28] <lxsameer> hi, i'm looking for a rss reader library for jquery, what do you suggest
[10:23:04] <BillCriswell> nicetry: Welcome
[10:24:19] <drager> BillCriswell: Not exactly what I'm looking for I suppose
[10:26:15] <BillCriswell> drager: Try refreshing it.
[10:26:23] <BillCriswell> Added links to choose a stylesheet.
[10:27:03] <madprops> how can I get the third div inserted by the button to respect the width of the div on the right and shrink accordingly? http://jsfiddle.net/Wpgqr/
[10:27:24] <madprops> or grow until it reaches the div
[10:32:08] <drager> BillCriswell: hm
[10:33:51] <jlgarcia> exit
[10:37:56] <mobile8> hi, i want to close a div when outside that div is clicked
[10:37:58] <mobile8> how can i accomplish this best?
[10:38:05] <mobile8> i tried several things, but got nothing properly working
[10:40:12] <drager> BillCriswell: I wonder how I should do that with my dropdown
[10:40:48] <BillCriswell> Use the link approach.
[10:41:34] <drager> BillCriswell: Yeah, but I can't just have ('a')
[10:41:55] <intergalactic> anyone tell me what rdio.com is using for album viewer
[10:42:06] <BillCriswell> $('.dropdown a') will work as well
[10:43:17] <madprops> can I do something like  $('#something').height($(this).height() - 300)   ?
[10:44:05] <madprops> instead of calling $('#something') again
[10:45:40] <BillCriswell> madprops: You can do it like $('#something').css('height', function(i, height){ return height - 300 }); I believe.
[10:45:57] <drager> BillCriswell: Hm, doesnt work out
[10:46:12] <thesisb> Given a set of jquery elements ie: $('body').find('a')  - What's the most effecient way to find all 'a' with a certain class?  $Filter?
[10:47:03] <sacho_> sure?
[10:47:40] <BillCriswell> madprops: Err... might need to do some string manipulation with the px and all
[10:48:53] <BillCriswell> madprops: http://jsbin.com/usurim/1/edit
[10:49:10] <madprops> BillCriswell, i ended up using $('#something').css('width', '+=' + 300)
[10:49:36] <BillCriswell> madprops: Ah, nice. Didn't know of that.
[10:49:50] <BillCriswell> '+=300' would be the same, just a heads up.
[10:50:02] <thesisb> unless 300 is a varname
[10:50:08] <madprops> i know it's because i'm not going to use a static number
[10:50:16] <thesisb> good tip
[10:50:47] <shoky> btw you can use a function with .height() as well
[11:00:59] <BillCriswell> shoky: That's what I used originally but the +=300 was exactly what he needed lol.
[11:05:49] <r1chard> Can someone tell me why I love jQuery so much when I disagree with every design decision in it.
[11:06:36] <NoiseEee> r1chard: because it lets you build working things quickly?
[11:06:47] <r1chard> Soemthing like this.
[11:06:50] <r1chard> But it's more.
[11:06:59] <r1chard> I know those heavily overloaded methods are WRONG.
[11:07:04] <r1chard> But I also see the appeal.
[11:07:08] <r1chard> I'm so confused.
[11:07:41] <NoiseEee> meh
[11:07:52] <NoiseEee> just remember, God doesn't care whether or not you use natural JS or a library
[11:07:58] <NoiseEee> so aside from her, who else do you need to answer to?
[11:08:10] <NoiseEee> there are no points for avoiding jquery.
[11:08:12] <r1chard> I like you.
[11:08:20] <NoiseEee> lets married
[11:08:26] <r1chard> Done.
[11:08:38] <SocialEvil> hi guys i am trying to make a script that checks if the username the user is typing is already taken. i am using keyup event, but i have a problem. everytime the user write a char, and its not taken i use $("#msgDiv").html("available"); but when user types chars, the message blinks (because its attached to keyup event). is there a better way(i dont want blur event) cause then the user needs to
[11:08:38] <SocialEvil> go back to that field. is there some event that allows me to output the message after the user stops typing for a brief moment ?
[11:08:42] <BillCriswell> Breaking the law?
[11:09:21] <jonez> SocialEvil, not directly. you could use a flag or a counter everytime there is a keyup to decide if you are going to change the html
[11:09:28] <BillCriswell> SocialEvil: You could look into throttle or debounce.
[11:09:40] <sacho_> sounds like a job for debounce!
[11:09:57] <SocialEvil> thanks guys ill go look into it :)
[11:09:58] <BillCriswell> SocialEvil: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ might be of interest to you.
[11:10:14] <BillCriswell> Particularly this example: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[11:10:23] <SocialEvil> thank you verry much :)))
[11:11:39] <BillCriswell> Welcoem!
[11:12:14] <royalty> hello why won't anything run on select? http://jsfiddle.net/taxTd/
[11:13:20] <BillCriswell> royalty: You're doing many things wrong here.
[11:13:54] <royalty> BillCriswell: I think it is probably just I am supposed to be using change instead of select
[11:14:10] <BillCriswell> That and 'first' should be '#first'
[11:14:11] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/taxTd/1/
[11:14:42] <royalty> BillCriswell: thanks
[11:14:54] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[11:15:15] <royalty> BillCriswell: why use on instead of just .change?
[11:15:36] <royalty> BillCriswell: is it just a nuance or is there an important difference?
[11:15:46] <BillCriswell> Just the preferred method now.
[11:15:50] <royalty> oh alright
[11:16:03] <BillCriswell> I'm sure .change() will do the job, too.
[11:16:06] <sacho_> .change calls .on()
[11:17:50] <jop008> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input ?
[11:17:57] <jop008> what can be the cause?
[11:18:21] <BillCriswell> jop008: You didn't close something.
[11:18:42] <jop008> { braces thing
[11:23:02] <dbrady> Could someone tell me why jquery's jsonp callback function is dynamically generated?
[11:29:32] <drager> BillCriswell: Your way doesnt work for me and I don't like that approach, can't I use .each() in a way?
[11:30:51] <BillCriswell> drager: You're just trying to change to an active stylesheet. What doesn't "my way" work for you and why would you request to use .each() specifically?
[11:34:27] <drager> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/u62TK/2/ there I can get the anchors class
[11:34:33] <nicetry> I've been reading the jquery docs for .on() and .off() but I can't seem to wrap my head around how to set up two different functions bound on 'scroll' to the same element, then only remove one of them but not the other.  How is this done?
[11:34:46] <Billy1> Anyone have experiance with the jquery form plugin from malsup? For some reason it's not throwing the ajaxStop event.. wondering if anyone else ran into the same problem
[11:36:17] <SocialEvil> BillCriswell yes, that debounce does exactly what i wanted :)thank you again
[11:36:26] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[11:41:51] <lx4r> Hey, I'm spawning dargable divs with jQuery and jQuery UI. My problem is that they spawn one under another which enlarges my site. How can I make them spawn one beside each other? My code: http://twitch.l3r.de/ (use "ignproleague" and "taketv" as channel names for testing)
[11:42:02] <lx4r> Thanks in advance for any help
[11:42:49] <drager> BillCriswell: No way to do it in my approach
[11:43:40] <BillCriswell> drager: You're approach seems over complicated.
[11:44:02] <nicetry> BillCriswell: I have another question about binding scroll events for ya
[11:44:28] <nicetry> How do I set up two different functions bound on 'scroll' to the same element, then only remove one of them but not the other?
[11:47:54] <drager> BillCriswell: Hm, I don't really see how I should use your approach.
[11:48:42] <tolka> hi
[11:48:50] <BillCriswell> nicetry: You'd have to use event namespaces.
[11:49:10] <BillCriswell> nicetry: http://docs.jquery.com/Namespaced_Events should help.
[11:50:01] <nicetry> BillCriswell: Thanks for the link, hopfully I'll be about to wrap my jquery soaked mind around it this time :)
[11:52:32] <BillCriswell> nicetry: http://jsbin.com/uyovop/1/edit if you find it easier looking at code.
[11:53:41] <drager> BillCriswell: Now it works but it loads pretty "bad"
[11:54:00] <nicetry> BillCriswell: You are the man!
[11:54:33] <BillCriswell> nicetry: Glad I could help.
[11:54:56] <nicetry> BillCriswell: You did, this is simple - just my preconcieved notions getting in the way
[12:08:11] <soee> hi how can i check if some function exists/is loaded
[12:09:35] <lx4r> Hey everyone, how can i find the most recent element, e.g. the most recent <div> of the class .test?
[12:09:52] <lx4r> Thanks in advance for any help
[12:11:10] <NoiseEee> what is "recent" ?
[12:11:14] <Hello9> Hello :)
[12:11:25] <Hello9>  Wanted to share a new programming forum: http://thedevshed.net/forum/
[12:11:31] <Hello9> feel free to join
[12:11:32] <Hello9> :)
[12:11:44] <lx4r> NoiseEee: I'm referring to the newest div of that class that I created
[12:12:00] <lx4r> NoiseEee: Sorry, my English is a little bad O:-)
[12:12:16] <lx4r> NoiseEee: Do you understand what I mean now?
[12:12:28] <NoiseEee> lx4r: there is no way of identifying the newest/most recent div you created, unless you specifically create a reference to it
[12:12:55] <lx4r> NoiseEee: Hmmmm, so something like :first won't work?
[12:13:12] <NoiseEee> lx4r: that has to do with position in the DOM, not when you added something to the DOM
[12:14:03] <lx4r> NoiseEee: The divs I'm referring to are all created by jQuery inside the same wrapper
[12:14:15] <lx4r> NoiseEee: One after another
[12:14:36] <lx4r> NoiseEee: And there's still no way of reffering to the most recent one?
[12:15:53] <NoiseEee> lx4r: not unless you're adding them in a specific DOM order, no.
[12:16:10] <lx4r> NoiseEee: Hmmm, okay, thanks for your help
[12:17:51] <davidmahoney> hey guys I don't even know if this possible so I create a image in the dom and what to capture that image and send to a email or something
[12:18:13] <davidmahoney> is there a jquery command that I could grab what ever image is on the screen
[12:18:31] <amph1bius> sure, $("img");
[12:18:53] <davidmahoney> img being the tag?
[12:19:29] <davidmahoney> would it be like var image = $('some_tag');
[12:19:51] <davidmahoney> well with the hashtag
[12:21:55] <bongjovi> Is this the wrong way to make something fade out and then fade in?     $("#content" + current).removeClass("hide", 1000, "", function() {$("#content" + current).addClass("show", 1000)});
[12:24:22] <Bloomberg> Guys!!
[12:24:58] <Bloomberg> Are there some way to separate the keys of an array passed from php with json_encode() to jquery
[12:26:03] <davidmahoney> $.parseJson
[12:26:16] <davidmahoney> actually $.parseJSON
[12:27:36] <utroda> Can anyone help me with this issue, trying to find a value in an array, but $inArray is always return -1 - http://jsfiddle.net/gv2sC/
[12:27:51] <marsman> hi there
[12:28:06] <marsman> what happened with the navigation option of jqueryui accordion?
[12:28:37] <marsman> it looks like it's missing on 1.10.2
[12:30:57] <BillCriswell> utroda: Should be $.inArray( needle, haystack )
[12:31:08] <wrapids> Could i get someone to look at a page and possibly tell me why my draggable/droppables are not dropping on the first try?
[12:32:04] <utroda> BillCriswell: even then it still returns -1
[12:32:46] <BillCriswell> don't think you can search for arrays in an array like that.
[12:32:52] <davidmahoney> anyone have experience with google static maps
[12:34:37] <utroda> BillCriswell: any idea how i would go about this this then?
[12:35:51] <BillCriswell> utroda: Are you looking for the "pizza" form that value property?
[12:36:42] <utroda> BillCriswell: yes, i want to check the applied values, for the adding value
[12:37:08] <BillCriswell> You'll have to loop through and check it.
[12:37:40] <marsman> Anyone knows how to add back the navigation functionality to the jquery accordion?
[12:37:59] <utroda> okay i will give that shot
[12:38:20] <BillCriswell> The structure of it is kind of weird.
[12:38:32] <BillCriswell> an array or arrays with 1 object.
[12:39:35] <b0ss_> hey I'm a newcomer in jQuery. I have checked the source code of it and I have noticed it's just a wrapper over Javascript, heavily using document.getElementById.
[12:40:00] <PerlWebDev> and?
[12:40:07] <ezakimak> give some credit
[12:40:07] <b0ss_> But I have noticed also that there are only anonymous functions in it. Is it right ?
[12:40:21] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: It's a whole lot more than just a wrapper...
[12:41:42] <b0ss_> Furthermore I have noticed it calls window.jQuery but in the DOM standard there is no such property jQuery in the window node.
[12:42:45] <ezakimak> your are in danger of exposing your level of competency
[12:42:48] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: I think you might be trying to talk about things a bit out of your league.
[12:42:58] <royalty> okay I have a weird problem
[12:43:05] <BillCriswell> royalty: Call a doctor.
[12:43:34] <royalty> I successfully use an ajax request to create a new element, I have a script set so that new element should trigger another ajax request but it isn't
[12:43:48] <b0ss_> BillCriswell: maybe
[12:43:54] <b0ss_> but I insist to get there
[12:43:55] <ezakimak> how would an element trigger anything by itself?
[12:44:03] <royalty> well I mean
[12:44:14] <royalty> on change it creates an element via an ajax request
[12:44:23] <royalty> it is an input
[12:44:35] <b0ss_> do they add the window.jquery by performing an Array.prototype ?
[12:44:39] <royalty> but when the new element is created jquery doesn't seem to recognize it
[12:44:49] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: http://robflaherty.github.io/jquery-annotated-source/ might help with some thigns.
[12:44:53] <ezakimak> so your input's onchange invokes $.ajax() with a success handler that creates a new dom node?
[12:45:04] <royalty> ezakimak: yeah
[12:45:10] <ezakimak> b0ss_, you're killing us
[12:45:20] <ddaymace> by not recognize do you mean you can't select it but it's in the DOM?
[12:45:29] <royalty> yeah
[12:45:34] <royalty> ddaymace, yes
[12:45:39] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: Actally, just read through the comments: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js
[12:45:44] <b0ss_> ezakimak: lol
[12:45:55] <b0ss_> BillCriswell: I'm on it
[12:46:00] <ezakimak> is the headlight fluid in your car low?
[12:46:07] <ezakimak> ;)
[12:46:10] <royalty> are you talking to me?
[12:46:20] <ddaymace> royalty : and you select it after it's created right?
[12:46:45] <royalty> ddaymace: ummm I don't know if I am I just have the event listener already there by the time it is created
[12:46:58] <ezakimak> what do you mean by jquery "does not recognize it" ?
[12:47:10] <royalty> ddaymace: is there a way to select it after it is created
[12:47:28] <ddaymace> yeah via ajax callback or a number of other ways
[12:47:29] <ezakimak> if you created it, don't you already have a variable pointing to it?
[12:47:29] <nicetry> Is it possible to stop a user-generate scroll event, mid-scroll?
[12:47:44] <ddaymace> if you store your selector in a var, it may not update
[12:47:56] <ezakimak> selectors are static
[12:48:03] <ddaymace> or you could ajax into a container that is already there on pageload
[12:48:23] <ezakimak> i mean if you did var el = $('<el>').appendTo(...), your el is already it
[12:48:36] <royalty> so you are essentially telling me to use ajax to create another script somehwere else on the page?
[12:48:45] <royalty> or just
[12:48:47] <royalty> somewhere on the page
[12:48:56] <ezakimak> your problem is a bit vague
[12:49:00] <ddaymace> ezakimak : true, what I meant to say was if he stores the selector before the element exists in the DOM
[12:49:07] <ezakimak> right
[12:49:12] <royalty> yeah that is what I am doing
[12:49:14] <ezakimak> he searched before it existed
[12:49:17] <Joel> does anything know of something like jsfiddle for sql?
[12:49:27] <royalty> yeah I am searching it before it exists
[12:49:36] <ezakimak> and you're puzzled why?...
[12:49:44] <ddaymace> use ajax on success callback
[12:49:45] <royalty> because what is a good work around
[12:49:45] <royalty> heh
[12:49:54] <ddaymace> then select
[12:50:03] <royalty> ohhhhh
[12:50:19] <royalty> yeah I could put the script in the callback function
[12:50:23] <royalty> cool
[12:50:29] <BillCriswell> Joel: That would be fun. Just a database with a bunch of random column types you can query
[12:50:31] <royalty> lets see if it works
[12:50:32] <ezakimak> ding ding ding! we have a winnah! :)
[12:50:42] <Joel> BillCriswell: looks like there is
[12:51:00] <ezakimak> the mysql tutorial chapter in the manual kinda helps you do that
[12:51:24] <BillCriswell> ezakimak: Do they supply a bunch of sample data?
[12:51:34] <ezakimak> but true, something already existing for people to play with and write tutorials against would be nice
[12:52:36] <BillCriswell> I hate making up sample data.
[12:52:53] <royalty> nice it works
[12:53:07] <royalty> ddaymace: thanks and ezakimak, thanks
[12:53:08] <ezakimak> a small schema with enough sample data to demonstrate every possible relation
[12:53:41] <ezakimak> would be useful to test ORMs against also
[12:54:56] <BillCriswell> Definitely would.
[12:55:44] <guideX> does toUpperCase() not work in ie9?
[12:56:34] <dunnoman> guideX: try firefox
[12:56:45] <guideX> well yes..
[12:57:02] <guideX> it's working in firefox
[12:57:09] <guideX> but not in ie9
[12:57:54] <ezakimak> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/kk06d70k(v=vs.94).aspx
[12:58:02] <ezakimak> requires you be in standards mode
[12:58:27] <guideX> hmm ok
[12:58:58] <guideX> thanks
[12:59:23] <ezakimak> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325.aspx
[12:59:36] <wrapids> Could i get someone to look at a page and possibly tell me why my draggable/droppables are not dropping on the first try?
[12:59:46] <stygyan> guys, is there any chance to change the styling of the scrollbar in a multiple option select field?
[13:00:12] <ezakimak> i don't think you can style the native platform's input controls
[13:00:30] <ezakimak> you'll need a replacement from jq ui or wijmo or the like
[13:00:42] <stygyan> yeah, that's why i'm asking in jquery
[13:00:42] <stygyan> :P
[13:00:51] <guideX> ezakimak: some browsers will do it. You must degrade the look if the browser doesn't support it
[13:01:08] <guideX> chrome and firefox do most of the styling, but you should test in ie and firefox and degrade accordingly
[13:02:16] <dunnoman> guideX: try adding .nodeName along with .toUpperCase.  Just courious
[13:02:32] <BillCriswell> wrapids: I can give it a shot.
[13:03:00] <guideX> dunnoman: that was it, I figured out a moment ago.. for some reason, in jquery with ie, the text is lowerccased automatically
[13:03:06] <guideX> I add a touppercase, and it works fine
[13:03:47] <guideX> cause i'm comparing uppercase text to other text which I uppercased, however for ie, the 1st compared text is lowercased automatically
[13:04:02] <guideX> I have no idea why heh
[13:05:37] <wrapids> BillCriswell: care if I pm you the url?
[13:05:45] <BillCriswell> I don't mind at all.
[13:08:10] <intergalactic> one of custom event examples uses the object name $.fn.twitterResult.events
[13:08:21] <intergalactic> does $.fn represent something special
[13:09:26] <marsman> let's say i have a variable named pathname, how can i find the value of pathname in a set of links on my page?
[13:09:49] <marsman> Like finding the anchor that matches pathname
[13:09:58] <guideX> is there a way to disable a dropdown item?
[13:10:03] <guideX> so the user cannot select it?
[13:10:13] <guideX> but they can still see it
[13:10:19] <NoiseEee> marsman: $(a[href='thePathYouSeek'])
[13:10:46] <NoiseEee> marsman: $("a[href='thePathYouSeek']") :P
[13:11:00] <diofeher> hey, I just updated to jquery 1.9.1.. But after that every time I try to use .text method, the text in element goes to [Object text]. any workaround to that or can anyone point me where I can see this function in jquery code?
[13:11:03] <marsman> NoiseEee: awesome, just like that? instead of 'thePathYouSeek' can i use the variable name?
[13:11:24] <NoiseEee> marsman: well you'd have to make it syntatically correct of course
[13:11:43] <NoiseEee> marsman: $("a[href='"+variable+"']")
[13:11:43] <marsman> I'm not sure how to put the var name in there
[13:11:50] <marsman> Aaaah, i get it
[13:12:06] <marsman> thanks NoiseEee !! Sounds pretty good to me, ill test it right away!
[13:12:16] <NoiseEee> good luck marsman
[13:12:52] <marsman> Since navigatoin option was removed from jquery accordion i'm trying to do this manually
[13:13:01] <marsman> navigation
[13:14:10] <marsman> worked flawlessly :)
[13:14:39] <lx4r> Have fun guys, bye
[13:17:34] <Hello2> Hello
[13:17:35] <Hello2>  Wanted to share a new programming forum: http://thedevshed.net/forum/
[13:17:41] <Hello2> feel free to join :)
[13:19:11] <co> Guys I need help. I have a problem with displaying an uploaded image. Can an image(browsed i.e. given as an input to file upload) be displayed with AJAX?
[13:19:50] <moijk> if you upload it, you can display it as long as the server can somehow reach it.
[13:20:05] <moijk> and you have properly adressed to it
[13:20:08] <ezakimak> iirc you can set an img's data value
[13:21:12] <jferrie> Anyone have experience with bower?
[13:21:25] <co> moijk, ezakimak, thanks but I want to display it before it reaches the server. I tried to do it but it is not displaying properly
[13:21:28] <ezakimak> something like img.src="data:..."
[13:22:04] <ezakimak> ah. then your problem isn't the image yet, first you have to get access to the file from the file input, a different problem
[13:22:44] <fladd> good evening
[13:23:33] <fladd> can anyone tell me why jquery loads fine here http://www.fladd.de/new but not here http://www.fladd.de/new/research ? I am wrappping my head around this for an hour and I have no clue what is going on. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance
[13:23:59] <guideX> nooby question but, is there something similar in jquery like vb's left function? like if(left(mystring, "-") <> 0) then ...
[13:24:22] <ezakimak> co: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[13:24:24] <guideX> basically something to check to see if the 1st character of a string contains a character
[13:24:52] <ezakimak> charAt
[13:24:58] <co> ezakimak Can I show you the code? So that you can understand what my problem is. Actually just after I give an input to file upload it should display that file(image). What I am getting is some binary data
[13:25:03] <guideX> thanks ezakimak
[13:25:53] <ezakimak> code is worth a thousand words
[13:27:21] <co> no. Its not so
[13:28:17] <co> ezakimak Have a look. Let me jsfiddle it.
[13:29:58] <guideX> hmm with charat I get this Object #<Object> has no method 'charAt'
[13:30:05] <BillCriswell> Array(1000).join('words')
[13:30:08] <guideX> I've tried $(this) and this
[13:31:18] <co> ezakimak: Here it is. http://jsfiddle.net/S9Z4b/
[13:31:30] <guideX> oh wait got it
[13:31:32] <guideX> nm
[13:33:46] <ezakimak> why do you test with isset() everywhere?
[13:34:03] <ezakimak> you can just use <?= $var ?>, if it's empty it outputs nothing
[13:34:59] <co> yeah thats right. thanks for pointing it out
[13:35:40] <ezakimak> also, why are you using xhtml? to access the local file via the file input you'll need to be html5
[13:36:57] <Wamer> hey, anyone please help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/6MqKp/
[13:37:01] <Wamer> it just doesnt work
[13:37:55] <marsman> Is it possible to "click" an element with jquery?
[13:37:56] <co> ezakimak: yeah. I saw it from the link you just gave me. I think this might help. Thanks a ton.
[13:38:21] <marsman> like .addClass('something') do something like click();
[13:39:30] <clov3r> yep
[13:39:45] <clov3r> $('element').click();
[13:40:01] <clov3r> : triggers the click event on the element
[13:40:20] <Wamer> $(this).children(".overlay").first().animate(options, 200); â€¦. any idea why this doesnt work ?
[13:45:29] <clov3r> sorry wamer, no idea here
[13:45:46] <Wamer> already got it .. i was supposed to use find
[13:45:51] <Wamer> instead of children
[13:51:56] <marsman> awesome
[13:55:57] <marsman> I actualyy want to simulate a click
[13:56:11] <marsman> if x condition is met, make a click
[13:57:50] <sirspazzolot> is there some standard way to, say, execute a function any time any button is clicked? I'm dealing with a microsoft sharepoint list here with some grouped items. all of the groups are collapsed by default, and it seems the html for the content simply does not exist until a group is expanded. I want to be able to modify any and all problem fields, which I could do if all the html was generated at the same time, but it isn't
[13:58:04] <NoiseEee> marsman: the better approach is to call the click *event handler* rather than simulate a click
[13:58:21] <NoiseEee> marsman: ie:  if(conditionMet) { theFunctionThatTheClickCalls(); }
[13:58:32] <NoiseEee> events are for people.
[13:59:11] <sirspazzolot> (also I'm interacting with an aspx page. my goal is to collapse long comment fields.
[13:59:13] <marsman> NoiseEee: I see
[13:59:14] <sirspazzolot> )
[13:59:38] <marsman> in this case i'm trying to find the event handler for the click on the UI accordion
[13:59:55] <marsman> I should be able to find it with the inspector right?
[14:02:04] <NoiseEee> marsman: yes, but you can also look into $.trigger()
[14:04:31] <marsman> NoiseEee: ill have to check that too then! I think i've found the event listener but i have no clue what to do next lol
[14:07:29] <Wamer> guys, do you know anything made with jquery that does this http://cl.ly/image/0D3C08212V2C ?
[14:07:41] <Wamer> imean sliding images with such simple pagination
[14:08:16] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[14:08:36] <Bloomberg> the "file" input is possible set value?
[14:09:05] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: no.
[14:09:23] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: other wise  i'd fill it with c:\windows\secretFile
[14:12:12] <Bloomberg> NoiseEee: I'm creating an update form, So I need to show the file input with actual value
[14:12:22] <Bloomberg> How will be the better way to do it!
[14:12:25] <NoiseEee> can't do it dude.
[14:12:41] <NoiseEee> what does an 'update' form mean?
[14:12:51] <NoiseEee> why would one need to re-upload the file/
[14:13:06] <NoiseEee> update all the info EXCEPT the actual file, or provide a means to delete/re-upload
[14:13:47] <Bloomberg> NoiseEee: upgrade, update, form
[14:14:02] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: can't see any reason at all why one would need to re-upload the same file????
[14:14:30] <Bloomberg> No, will be for replace the file
[14:14:49] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: so ask them to choose the file .
[14:14:57] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: thats the only way
[14:15:02] <ezakimak> any jq ui maintainers/devs here?
[14:24:56] <toddWork_> i have some divs with data-prefs='true' or data-prefs='false' (basically, does a user want to see this div or not); who do i loop through those data-prefs and act on each one?
[14:26:21] <ezakimak> try $('*[data-prefs]").each(function(el) { if (el.data('prefs') == 'true') { ... } else {...} })
[14:26:26] <NoiseEee> $('div[data-prefs]').each(function(i,el) { var div = $(el);  if(div.attr('data-prefs')=='true')   { //etc
[14:26:35] * NoiseEee fires ezakimak
[14:26:56] <toddWork_> ah.
[14:27:07] <toddWork_> thanks ezakimak NoiseEee
[14:27:23] <toddWork_> google was sending me all over the place but not to this.
[14:32:03] <marsman> NoiseEee: I'm truly completely lost. What i'm trying to do is that after the user clicks a menu, if the link matches the current url, the accordion section with the matchin link starts open
[14:32:16] <marsman> *matching
[14:32:26] <NoiseEee> sorry im off to home
[14:32:35] <NoiseEee> good luck, someone will help!  pastebin what you ahve so far
[14:32:51] <marsman> I have the matching done, i just can't find a way to open the accordion pane
[14:33:07] <NoiseEee> well find that a and .trigger('click')
[14:33:09] <marsman> Ok! Np! thanks for the help!
[14:33:39] <marsman> tried that, but fails silently :S
[14:34:08] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ marsman
[14:34:10] <NoiseEee> now i'm really gone.
[14:34:23] <marsman> Ill take a look at that, thanks!
[14:35:38] <Whirl3d> Good evening all. Anybody got a suggestion for an easy to use timeline jquery library? I have a legal presentation that I need to plot phone logs using a timeline and was hoping to find a decent jquery plugin.
[14:36:13] <yoavz> Hi all,
[14:36:26] <Whirl3d> Hi yoavz
[14:36:56] <Z3R0> Whirl3d: http://timeline.verite.co/ ?
[14:37:30] <Whirl3d> Not a jquery library, I'm afraid. Though it was the first google result, thanks.
[14:37:36] <Z3R0> lol
[14:38:00] <yoavz> I'm currently using jquery isotope to sort some items on a page, modified some WP design that I found fit. I'm trying to force it to fit all the items to 100% screen height with zero vertical scrolling. I tried many things but with no results. demo page: http://facebook.yoavz.net/tom/
[14:38:01] <Whirl3d> I was hoping someone had some experience with a timeline JQUERY library and could offer a personal perspective you can't get through Google.
[14:38:41] <Z3R0> the source is on github...
[14:38:43] <yoavz> I don't mind that the items will scale down to fit the page 100% vertical & horizontal size
[14:38:53] <Z3R0> https://github.com/VeriteCo/TimelineJS/tree/master/source/js lol
[14:39:12] <Whirl3d> yoavz, do you mean each square you want scaled and stacked?
[14:39:51] <yoavz> Whirl3d, I want the page to have no scrolls, I want the items to resize to fit the page without scrolling
[14:39:55] <Z3R0> http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/12/jquery-timeline-plugins.html // here's a bunch of nifty ones lol
[14:39:56] <yoavz> I don't mind having blanks
[14:40:49] <Z3R0> timeline calendar is pretty neat ;)
[14:41:01] <Z3R0> eh but they charge...
[14:41:02] <Whirl3d> Z3R0, you are sweet to google for me, but again, it's the personal experience quotient I was looking for in here. I have looked at several of those you just linked, just wondering based on PERSONAL EXPERIENCE which would be best. LOL
[14:42:13] <Whirl3d> yoavz, it is going to be difficult to go through your source code the way you have it posted. Could you go to jsfiddle and create a focused example with just the code that is not working?
[14:44:07] <yoavz> Whirl3d, it's all part of a Wordpress theme that I have
[14:44:17] <yoavz> The page you're seeing is a wordpress site
[14:44:29] <Whirl3d> yoavz, you might be better off asking in #wordpress
[14:44:51] <yoavz> Whirl3d, it's not a Wordpress issue, it's some setting I'm missing with the jquery settings...
[14:44:57] <Whirl3d> yoavz, jst because the first script I opened doesn't correctly make use of jquery anyways.
[14:45:00] <yoavz> Wordpress is only responsible for the content
[14:45:42] <yoavz> What do you mean by that? (<--- I'm pretty new to all of this)
[14:46:00] <tw2113> just blame me for everything
[14:46:29] <Whirl3d> yoavz, wherever you see: var x=document.getElementByTag('something');  that would be var x=$('.something'); for example.
[14:47:02] <tw2113> no that would be for <something>
[14:47:20] <Whirl3d> I just noticed that. LOL
[14:47:33] <tw2113> var x=$('.something'); would target <something class="something">
[14:48:11] <Whirl3d> right. I was trying to reply quickly. My bad; sorry for the mistake.
[14:48:34] <tw2113> before asked, i have no timeline suggestions other than googled ones
[14:48:39] <tw2113> because i've never used any before
[14:48:54] <OliverJAsh_> i have an API on a separate domain which i am calling with jquery (backbone fetch but jquery ajax underneath). it seems to error however in IE (9). is there something i need to do? i'm using CORS.
[14:49:35] <yoavz> Whirl3d, tw2113 - Do you have any suggestions for me to try?
[14:50:00] <Whirl3d> yoavz, unless you are ready to learn Js, Jquery (in that order), I would suggest contacting the theme author.
[14:50:23] <Whirl3d> yoavz, I meant html, js, jquery, wordpress api (in that order). LOL
[14:50:50] <tw2113> i don't even know what the issue is
[14:51:10] <yoavz> tw2113 - This is the page: http://facebook.yoavz.net/tom/
[14:51:18] <yoavz> I don't want it to be able to scroll
[14:51:41] <yoavz> I want all the boxes to fit the 100% length of the page, with no scrolls
[14:51:49] <tw2113> *shrug*
[14:52:02] <tw2113> it's definitely a js issue more than some WordPress issue that someone mentioned
[14:52:32] <yoavz> I mentioned that it's all based on a Wordpress theme, but the problem is definetly not a WP problem.
[14:52:41] <Whirl3d> I am not saying it's a wordpress issue, just that someone familiar with that WordPress theme would know.
[14:52:54] <tw2113> the theme makes no difference
[14:53:22] <tw2113> you have your content right there, it sounds like you want it to take up 100% of the browser window
[14:53:30] <tw2113> so it's a js thing
[14:53:47] <Whirl3d> Cool. You're the king. solve it for him.
[14:53:59] <yoavz> ok, now it's fitting nicely to 100% width
[14:54:02] <tw2113> i refused that crown a long time ago
[14:54:27] <yoavz> I want it to fit 100% height, no scrolls, just like the width
[14:54:39] <Whirl3d> fyi, it appears to have always fit 100% width from my perspective...
[14:55:01] <yoavz> Whirl3d, I know. I want the height to act the same way.
[14:56:03] <Whirl3d> do the squares have to have the same relative proportions?
[14:56:37] <yoavz> Yes. I don't mind the size itself, just as long as they retain the proportions
[14:57:32] <marsman> I made it!
[14:57:49] <marsman> My code was above the accordion init code Â¬Â¬
[14:58:22] <Whirl3d> I noticed the script calculates the height by checking if it is an object then it uses this.attr('height') otherwise it uses this.height(). but then it uses this.width() every time. Is it possible you have to use this.attr('width') for objects?
[15:00:02] <yoavz> Whirl3d, TBH, I'm not that familiar with jquery to answer this question.
[15:01:53] <Whirl3d> yoavz, that's what I was afraid of. that's why i suggested contacting the original author. regardless, you can't force these to be squares and expect them to fill BOTH the height and width.
[15:02:15] <Whirl3d> or could you....(thinking back to my math days...)..
[15:03:17] <yoavz> I don't mind having gaps, just as long at it'll fit the page...
[15:03:29] <ezakimak> width() probably handles floats for you
[15:04:25] <yoavz> BTW, Whirl3d, where have seen "this.attr()" ?
[15:05:01] <Whirl3d> line 65 in fitvids.js
[15:05:54] <Whirl3d> I'm not sure, but does $(this).attr('height') work regardless of this.tagName.toLowerCase()?
[15:06:51] <yoavz> Actually only theme_trust.js and the Isotope plugin is in use
[15:07:27] <Whirl3d> You need to find theme_trust.js and isotope.js non-minimized if i am gonna look at it.
[15:07:43] <Whirl3d> theme_trust is not minimized, sorry
[15:10:06] <yoavz> Whirl3d, https://github.com/desandro/isotope/blob/master/jquery.isotope.js
[15:10:36] <Whirl3d> in line 184 of theme_trust.js it states, $(".videocontainer").fitVids(); which calls a method from the fitVids.js script, I think.
[15:12:35] <yoavz> Whirl3d, we have no videos on that page so it's not in use, AFAIK
[15:17:49] <Whirl3d> Sorry, 1409 lines of code for isotope, way too much for me to help with. Maybe someone who knows isotope would be able to tackle that for you. wish I could help.
[15:17:57] <fonko> hey guys what is the $(document).ready(function {})?
[15:18:05] <Whirl3d> fonko. LOL
[15:18:27] <fonko> i need to set a scrollTop(0) so each time a user changes pages this page is presented form the beginning and not at the end
[15:19:47] <yoavz> Whirl3d, first of all, thank you for the help. if you'll have any idea, please PM me here, I'm idle here 24/7...
[15:19:54] <yoavz> Thank you very much!
[15:20:15] <Whirl3d> yoavz, I'll keep looking and let you know.
[15:20:41] <yoavz> Thanks :)
[15:21:16] <fonko> so there is no $(document).ready ? :$
[15:21:56] <zergion> why is this simple code not working? A hover toggle with a simple color change http://pastebin.com/RVHVAVgE
[15:22:35] <Whirl3d> fonko, that is an immediate executing function....or something like that. It's how you say, "once the document is loaded, do this...so try $(document0.ready(function () {$(document).scrollTop(0);}));   or something close to that..
[15:23:08] <fonko> interesting
[15:23:29] <fonko> thanks for the lead !
[15:24:53] <Whirl3d> fonko, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9396415/differences-between-document-ready-and-function
[15:25:10] <fonko> :))
[15:27:10] <zergion> why is this simple code not working? A hover toggle with a simple color change http://pastebin.com/RVHVAVgE
[15:27:19] <Whirl3d> omg, what did I come here for? LOL
[15:27:55] <Whirl3d> zergion, do you have jqueryUI loaded? I could be wrong, but I think you need jqueryUI to animate color.
[15:28:44] <Whirl3d> zergion, from the jquery api: Note: The jQuery UI project extends the .animate() method by allowing some non-numeric styles such as colors to be animated.
[15:28:52] <zergion> sigh...
[15:29:25] <Whirl3d> that or the jquery.Color plugin, i guess..
[15:29:49] <Whirl3d> but one work around would be to put two elements on top of each other and fade one out on hover
[15:30:52] <zergion> I'll use the UI. Thank you
[15:31:00] <Whirl3d> yw
[15:37:22] <ezakimak> i finally found where in the code it's broken... now to try to fix it
[15:39:41] <OliverJAsh> test
[15:41:19] <Toerkeium> hello guys, I have upgraded my jquery ui libraries and I'm making the upgrade. I cannot find a way to set the default tabs to the one I want. Before I had them like this: $( "#tabs" ).tabs("option", 'selected', 2);
[15:41:35] <Toerkeium> any idea?
[15:41:55] <ezakimak> i think it's 'activate'
[15:42:10] <Toerkeium> I'll try, thanks ezakimak
[15:44:06] <Toerkeium> No ezakimak, but it's ok I'll continue searching
[15:46:31] <Toerkeium> it was active, thanks!
[16:26:21] <Oria1024> Can someone help me with a logic issue I'm stuck on?
[16:27:00] <vladikoff> Oria1024, could you explain your logic issue
[16:27:25] <Oria1024> I want to update the value of something in a droppable zone instead of duplicating the item I've dropped
[16:28:02] <Oria1024> http://pastebin.com/fe9DV6js
[16:28:10] <Oria1024> here is the function
[16:29:25] <Oria1024> basically what I want it to do is to check and see if there is another div with the same prodRel that already exists...if it does, update the value.
[16:32:07] <Oria1024> any suggestions?
[16:36:41] <Oria1024> @vladikoff - I'm very new to jquery so my issue might be in my syntax as well...not sure
[16:36:49] <Oria1024> any help you can give me would be most appreciated
[16:38:17] <vladikoff> Oria1024, reading...
[16:38:24] <Oria1024> thank you!
[16:44:42] <vladikoff> Oria1024, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/iHbKF would this help you?
[16:46:29] <Oria1024> let me take a look and try it out
[16:53:04] <Oria1024> This is helpful.  Thank you.
[16:53:42] <rakl> hey, I'm receiving a binary response from the server, how do I trigger a download from it?
[16:53:48] <rakl> using .ajax
[16:55:45] <vladikoff> rakl, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3499597/javascript-jquery-to-download-file-via-post-with-json-data
[16:57:00] <ebernhardson> how can i hook into a soft-reload?  Like if the user uses the back then forward button in the browser?  Testing in chrome $(document).ready() is only called on the hard reload, not the soft reload
[17:07:19] <orangerobot> is it possible to do a filter on a result from a selection (result of a jquery selector) using the native javascript filter
[17:08:03] <orangerobot> and, inside the filter callback, do things like : return true if this element's id is not equal to X
[17:11:40] <orangerobot> are my messages not getting through or am I just being ignored?
[17:11:52] <vladikoff> orangerobot, hi
[17:11:56] <ebernhardson> orangerobot: do you see a ton of other conversations going on?
[17:12:01] <orangerobot> i don't
[17:12:02] <ebernhardson> orangerobot: or in other worsd, the room is dead :P
[17:12:05] <coldhead> i'm ignoring you
[17:12:09] <coldhead> all of you
[17:12:49] <orangerobot> ah ok i don't mind being ignored, if my messages are getting through then somebody will eventually answer... i'm not in a hurry, just wanted to make sure i'm not banned or something like that
[17:12:52] <ebernhardson> orangerobot: random guess ... if you want to find out you probably need to dig into the sizzle engine and see how it works
[17:13:34] <orangerobot> ebernhardson: well my immediate problem was solved using $(this) inside the callback
[17:13:44] <orangerobot> and not passing any parameters via the function argument
[17:13:58] <orangerobot> somehow $(this) gets passed on for me i guess
[17:14:06] <coldhead> why do you need to use the native filter?
[17:14:09] <orangerobot> a little magic going on perhaps =)
[17:14:16] <orangerobot> well so I can chain stuff
[17:14:24] <orangerobot> .map.map.filter
[17:14:28] <orangerobot> that sort of things
[17:16:15] <coldhead> i'd be all like http://jsfiddle.net/mS3NB/
[17:16:19] <coldhead> and getting on with my life
[17:16:29] <coldhead> but it's pretty much my first day using jQuery so YMMV
[17:16:41] <orangerobot> hehe
[17:16:41] <vladikoff> coldhead, good work
[17:16:55] <orangerobot> yeah I just didn't know that the 'this' object got put inside of the function
[17:16:59] <orangerobot> it makes things easier
[17:17:13] <orangerobot> the $(this) jquery object actually
[17:17:26] <orangerobot> which is not the same as this
[17:17:33] <orangerobot> iirc
[17:17:40] <coldhead> it's the new and improved version of this
[17:17:49] <orangerobot> yeah
[17:17:50] <coldhead> this with a push up bra
[17:17:51] <orangerobot> suits me
[17:17:56] <coldhead> that adds two cup sizes
[17:18:06] <orangerobot> hehe
[17:18:06] <coldhead> BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THINGS ARE BETTER WHEN THEY ARE BIGGER
[17:18:25] <orangerobot> ze bra just makes it 'look' bigger hehe
[17:18:40] <abjorn> yes which is why texas is the best place to live, coldhead
[17:18:53] <abjorn> im glad you cant see my face right now because it is not straight
[17:19:11] <coldhead> no i did hear that about texas
[17:19:16] <orangerobot> why is texas bad?
[17:19:29] <coldhead> texas is like arizona for poor people
[17:19:41] <orangerobot> isn't ron paul form tx?
[17:19:45] <abjorn> no arizona is arizona for poor people
[17:19:48] <abjorn> yeah
[17:19:49] <orangerobot> i love that guy
[17:19:52] <abjorn> i mean, austin is awesome
[17:19:57] <abjorn> the rest of texas not so much
[17:20:00] <vladikoff> this started off so well, by solving filter issues...
[17:20:03] <orangerobot> i already like texas just because of him hehe
[17:20:07] <abjorn> lol
[17:20:17] <abjorn> it was not intentional, vladikoff
[17:20:32] <vladikoff> all banned and ignored.
[17:20:33] <abjorn> well maybe a little bit
[17:20:40] <abjorn> ono
[17:21:50] <abjorn> i wish doctor who episodes would come quicker
[17:22:16] <abjorn> like every day or something
[17:22:38] <coldhead> why don't you just go back and enjoy the old ones?
[17:22:41] <coldhead> there are hundreds
[17:22:45] <coldhead> they are almost all terrible
[17:23:14] <abjorn> you're terrible
[17:23:17] <abjorn> and i might actually do that
[17:25:42] <abjorn> im sorry coldhead but we dont allow first timers to have opinions around here
[17:28:28] <coldhead> i respect that
[17:42:42] <lenswipee> hi, can jQuery be used to retrieve data parsed from specific areas of a php file? (not complete file).
[17:48:51] <ezakimak> lenswipee, you need to be more specific. php runs on the server, and generates "something" sent from the server to the client. you can control what that "somthing" is, and jquery/javascript can do whatever you want with whatever that "something" is
[17:49:06] <Khruu> Hello, why this code doesnt work? http://pastebin.com/0ZmwsDDp
[17:51:18] <Khruu> Forget put success: function(data) on pastebin
[17:52:12] <lenswipee> ezakimak: it's probably a php question i think. i want to use jquery to send an ajax request to the server to act on a php file. I want the server to parse part, not all of, the php file and return the results.
[17:53:25] <coldhead> if i could just leave my body for a night
[17:53:57] <lenswipee> coldhead: hi buddy, any ideas?
[17:54:06] <coldhead> you lost me at php
[17:54:09] <coldhead> i suddenly felt very tired
[17:54:25] <coldhead> as though all my internal organs had just liquefied
[17:54:28] <lenswipee> coldhead: yeh i know you don't like php.
[17:54:36] <coldhead> i don't like most things
[17:54:46] <coldhead> but ain't nobody got time for php
[17:55:10] <coldhead> what's the PHP file returning?
[17:55:23] <coldhead> if it's HTML you can use jQuery to isolate just the bits you're interested in
[17:56:03] <lenswipee> coldhead: Well it's HTML populated with data generated from PHP.
[17:56:59] <lenswipee> coldhead: the php file itself contains a few sidebars, i want to return results from just one of them, hence what i mean by parsing some, but not, all of the php file.
[18:00:28] <coldhead> lenswipee: http://jsfiddle.net/XZdnd/
[18:00:31] <coldhead> something like that then
[18:01:54] <coldhead> i'm sure your own circumstances are infinitely more complex and nuanced
[18:05:54] <lenswipee> coldhead: take a look, http://jsfiddle.net/XZdnd/1/
[18:17:28] <coldhead> OH GOD I AM ARGUING WITH CLIENTS ABOUT MONEY
[18:19:58] <jdelgado> coldhead: Wait, you are charing someone to code, then get free advice from IRC?
[18:20:00] <lenswipee> coldhead: Thanks, I think that will work. Probably not as efficient as using the server to get
[18:20:01] <Aquaguy> Hello, is there anything to poll messages from a server without being doing $.post or $.get all the time?
[18:20:45] <jdelgado> coldhead: Disregard, I'm not paying attention apparently.
[18:20:53] <lenswipee> coldhead: part of the html, but then again the client does the work in getting the parts, so less load on the server.
[18:21:26] <jdelgado> Aquaguy: You can use a push service. Other than that, no.
[18:21:30] <coldhead> as long as it does what you want, lenswipee, do it and move on
[18:22:03] <coldhead> AND I WANT TO WALK AROUND WITH YOU I WANT TO WALK TO AROUND WITH YOU
[18:22:33] <lenswipee> coldhead: anyway, you got some talent. thanks.
[18:23:29] <coldhead> the only real talent i have is i can pee in my own mouth in the shower
[18:23:45] <coldhead> but i have no talent in knowing not to do that
[18:23:48] <coldhead> mmm, salty
[18:25:04] <coldhead> just you just you just you just you
[18:44:44] <lenswipee> I suppose you cannot hide DOM data objects from a callback when they have not been inserted into the html DOM
[18:45:18] <jj1234> hi, anyone have any problems with jqm and android touching list items
[18:45:25] <jj1234> it's almost like my calibration is off
[18:45:45] <jj1234> i touch one element, and a different one registers the hit
[18:45:57] <jj1234> it actually throws off all touches while the list box is expanded
[18:46:07] <jj1234> if I collapse the list, I can touch icons again
[18:47:55] <coldhead> alert('This site works best on iPhone')
[18:48:30] <jj1234> yeah, good idea

[18:50:22] <lenswipee> coldhead: i assume i have to insert first then make it invisible, but then for a split miliisecond user will see it.
[18:50:42] <vladikoff> jj1234, what version of Android? Stock browser?

[18:52:09] <corpster> hi, just some jquery 101. does jQuery(selector)  == $(selector) ?
[18:53:07] <lenswipee> coldhead: can you explain in words what that line of code does?
[18:53:39] <vladikoff> corpster, yeap
[18:54:26] <corpster> im just reading thru jquery tryign to understand it a bit better.. I cant find  anywhere in the code where $ is defined as jQuery.. I can see the jQuery = fucntion... but i cant see where $=jQuery.. how does that get defined?

[19:00:15] <vladikoff> corpster, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/exports.js#L23
[19:03:22] <corpster> vladikoff - thanks. i found that line in my jquery
[19:03:34] <vladikoff> corpster, perfect
[19:03:35] <corpster> i have just been trying to get myt head around the meaning of $
[19:03:42] <lenswipee> coldhead: this is what i mean buddy, see http://jsfiddle.net/XZdnd/2/
[19:04:01] <coldhead> it represents a "dollar" unit of currency
[19:04:08] <corpster> i understand now :) variables being functions is a bit of a foriegn concept :p
[19:05:03] <coldhead> ah you'll grow to love it
[19:05:23] <coldhead> the best thing is when you have functions return other functions
[19:05:28] <coldhead> that's better than sex
[19:05:31] <coldhead> or at least so i'm told
[19:05:41] <coldhead> still waiting for puberty myself
[19:07:04] <coldhead> lenswipee: http://jsfiddle.net/XZdnd/3/
[19:07:11] <coldhead> you need another div and another var, i think
[19:09:46] <lenswipee> coldhead: i think you misunderstood me. I want to hide the div.two in the RETURNED html before inserting html into target
[19:11:35] <coldhead> it wasn't so much a misunderstanding as i got very tired and bored
[19:11:46] <coldhead> you know better than i do what you need, so you're the best person to write it
[19:12:20] <tw2113> hide in what way?
[19:12:22] <tw2113> display: none?
[19:12:35] <lenswipee> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/XZdnd/4/
[19:12:36] <tw2113> completely remove from the dom?
[19:12:46] <lenswipee> problem is i don't know how to write it.
[19:12:55] <lenswipee> not completely just hidden
[19:13:04] <coldhead> in the sense of shutting ones eyes and saying "this isn't happening! THIS ISN'T HAPPENING!"
[19:13:11] <lenswipee> yeh
[19:13:14] <tw2113> why not just add some CSS ahead of time that targets the div
[19:13:19] <lenswipee> i updated the comments to make it more clear
[19:13:28] <tw2113> .two { display: none; }
[19:13:37] <ddaymace_> .
[19:15:22] <nohup> hi
[19:15:23] <lenswipee> will jquery codes that trigger that div to be visible still work if that css is there. anyway nice to know how to do it with jquery
[19:15:47] <nohup> is there a place I can find the svg file for icons used in jquery mobile?
[19:15:50] <tw2113> sounds like trying to do it solely with jQuery is the long route
[19:16:12] <tw2113> especially trying to use jQuery to intercept and hide while it's still processing on the server
[19:16:16] <coldhead> it's my fault, tw2113
[19:16:19] <coldhead> i lead him astray
[19:16:29] * tw2113 makes coldhead update a WP install
[19:16:51] <tw2113> and yes lenswipee .show() should make it visible if it's hidden by external css first
[19:17:00] <tw2113> because it attaches styles inline
[19:17:17] <lenswipee> ah nice to know
[19:17:27] <lenswipee> back to jquery, can it be done?
[19:17:42] <tw2113> so i just told you an easy and 2 minute method to do WHAT YOU WANT
[19:17:51] <tw2113> and you go back to the route that takes you to the moon and back
[19:18:10] <lenswipee> that is, the returned html data in the callback can hide() some part of it before inserting into the dom?
[19:18:26] <tw2113> accept defeat and use css
[19:18:38] <lenswipee> i have a feeling it is not possible.
[19:18:57] <tw2113> if it is, it's very convoluted and spaghetti style
[19:19:35] <lenswipee> what is this $mercury thing doing then, in http://jsfiddle.net/XZdnd/4/
[19:20:13] <tw2113> sitting there like a chump
[19:20:31] <lenswipee> so it's not what i'm after?
[19:20:50] <tw2113> that spot is doing nothing on the server
[19:20:50] <coldhead> you're after whatever works
[19:21:06] <tw2113> it's inside the success callback which is after the server has processed its poo
[19:21:07] <xp_prg2> hi all, I am trying to find a good datagrid plugin, can anyone recommend one?
[19:21:24] <tw2113> foo's poo
[19:21:24] <lenswipee> coldhead: not it ain't working
[19:21:44] <lenswipee> first up what is <div />
[19:22:01] <coldhead> it just creates a temporary div you can do stuff in
[19:22:18] <lenswipee> ahh
[19:22:46] <lenswipee> coldhead: then that code should work
[19:22:55] <xp_prg2> hello?
[19:22:55] <tw2113> actually $mercury is hitting on coldhead's sister
[19:23:17] <coldhead> i wish she could land a god of that caliber
[19:23:32] <tw2113> you'd be loaded with $() then
[19:24:15] <madprops> anybody knows if there's a library for handling tiles that can be splitted vertically and horizontally indefinitely
[19:24:19] <lenswipee> question is will users even see "it" if i insert first and hide later?
[19:24:39] <coldhead> ?tias
[19:24:39] <b-ot> coldhead: Try It And See
[19:24:39] <bot-t> Try It And See
[19:25:31] <lenswipee> yes
[19:25:40] <lenswipee> for a split millisecond
[19:27:05] <coldhead> $('#target').hide().html( sidebar ).show() ?
[19:28:17] <traets> when you have <meta name='robots' ..    <meta name='description..     how would you target the content of meta robots without an IF?
[19:32:20] <lenswipee> coldhead: you maybe onto something but it its part of the sidebar that needs to be hidden
[19:33:57] <coldhead> $('#sidebar .two').hide().replaceWith( sidebar ).show();
[19:34:07] <coldhead> i don't really even understand why all this show hide stuff is necessary
[19:34:22] <lenswipee> lol
[19:34:58] <coldhead> usually i am content just to let users see content, without worrying about them seeing things for a millisecond first
[19:35:10] <coldhead> but it's all academic seeing as how no one visits any sites other than facebook anyway
[19:35:47] <sparuvu> quick question â€¦. lets say I have a function rise(). what is the difference between rise()  vs $(rise)
[19:35:56] <lenswipee> coldhead: not true, porno sites still most highly viewed.
[19:36:15] <lenswipee> coldhead: and i would know.
[19:38:20] <traets> how can i do something like $('a [title="foo"]') but have 'foo' be case insensitive
[19:38:27] <traets> cause if it's FOO it doesn't work
[19:39:09] <coldhead> traets: make all your titles lowercase
[19:39:26] <traets> sounds like extra work there, sonny
[19:39:33] <traets> =D
[19:39:56] <traets> i have to loop through the whole dom object then do it again
[19:41:13] <alexzanf> hey guys anyone using requirejs or durandal?
[19:41:56] <coldhead> traets: http://jsfiddle.net/mbTSz/
[19:42:42] <traets> thanks coldhead
[19:42:59] <traets> still wish you could od it in the selector
[19:43:06] <traets> but it is what it ISSSSSss
[19:43:15] <coldhead> traets: if you want to you can extend jquery's selectors with a pattern like this http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[19:43:18] <coldhead> it's quite easy
[19:43:23] <coldhead> and you'll feel like a cool guy
[19:43:44] <coldhead> you could make a :title() pseudo-selector
[19:43:48] <coldhead> which was case insensitive
[19:44:21] <coldhead> or you could use that :regex one with :regex(title, /something/i)
[19:44:23] <coldhead> apparently
[19:44:25] <coldhead> 0 work
[19:44:53] <lenswipee> coldhead: worked it out
[19:46:18] <lenswipee> coldhead: $(#target).hide().html(sidebar).find('div.two').hide(); $('#target').show();
[19:46:23] <sparuvu> traets:  try this
[19:46:25] <sparuvu> $('a[title="'+"FOO".toLowerCase()+"\"]"
[19:46:37] <lenswipee> coldhead: can you improve that beauty?
[19:46:37] <sparuvu> it looks lil dirty but it workd
[19:47:15] <sparuvu> traets: http://jsfiddle.net/FunCr/
[19:47:38] <coldhead> it looks fine to me, lenswipee
[19:47:50] <coldhead> if it's readable and it works then case closed
[19:48:23] <lenswipee> coldhead: fair enough, you prefer this solution over the <div/> solution?
[19:48:48] <coldhead> yeah i guess so
[19:48:49] <lenswipee> coldhead: and which is faster buddy?
[19:48:50] <traets> sparuvu: that converts it to lower case, no?
[19:48:55] <coldhead> not having to use a dummy div is nice
[19:48:59] <coldhead> yours is probably faster
[19:49:12] <coldhead> although this is just a single function that runs once
[19:49:15] <coldhead> ?optimisation
[19:49:16] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[19:50:10] <xp_prg2> so nobody has experience with creating pure js tables with jquery widgets here?
[19:50:17] <xp_prg2> I have used datatables before
[19:50:57] <lenswipee> coldhead: what's wrong with optimisation?
[19:51:47] <sparuvu> traets: yes correct. then you can do something like this $(a, b)â€¦. where a is the opposite case of b
[19:51:49] <lenswipee> coldhead: and i was just about to ask you if its better to do $('.foo:first') then $('.foo') when you know there is only one.
[19:51:49] <alexzanf> hey guys i created a new view in durandal, how do i switch to it from another view? <-- can i get help with that here? or can you guys recommend another channel?
[19:57:37] <gamerx> I'm havign some issues with SlideUp, SlideDown and callbacks for them.
[19:57:51] <gamerx> It doesn;t seem to cvomplete SlideUp before initiating SlideDown
[19:58:13] <gamerx> Even though the SlideDown is in the callback for SlideUp
[19:58:16] <traets> sparuvu: but what is FoO
[19:58:23] <traets> FoBAr
[19:58:51] <gamerx> URl: https://gamerx.me/
[19:58:55] <myhrlin> traets: 1. interj. Term of disgust.
[19:59:05] <myhrlin> traets: 2. [very common] Used very generally as a sample name for absolutely anything, esp. programs and files (esp. scratch files).
[19:59:10] <hazamonzo> hey folks. If i use .get to get a html file and store this html into a variable... how can i search for a certain HTML tag and remove it from the html variable?
[19:59:14] <myhrlin> traets: 3. First on the standard list of metasyntactic variables used in syntax examples. See also bar, baz, qux, quux, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, thud.
[20:00:00] <traets> what
[20:00:06] <traets> fobar
[20:00:19] <myhrlin> you mean foobar?
[20:00:23] <traets> yes
[20:00:25] <traets> i thought you were a bot
[20:00:29] <traets> who thought fobar was foobar
[20:00:48] <myhrlin> sure I'm a bot
[20:00:51] <traets> oh.. i just realized i ask 'what is foo'
[20:01:02] <traets> what i meant was, 'but what about foo'
[20:01:12] <myhrlin> I see
[20:01:22] <traets> sorry there
[20:01:32] <myhrlin> no worries, I took it too seriously I suppose
[20:01:46] <myhrlin> I was all like "I got this, I know what foo is"
[20:01:54] <traets> wouldve been a great answer if i actually had meant what i asked
[20:02:06] * myhrlin nods.
[20:02:07] <traets> like 100+ upvotes on stackoverflow, at least
[20:02:38] <myhrlin> I have a reference too
[20:02:48] <traets> although... garply, quux?
[20:02:48] <traets> news to me
[20:03:08] <myhrlin> http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html
[20:03:46] <gamerx> Any ideas?
[20:04:19] <gamerx> Script for the sliding stuff is here: https://gamerx.me/js/script.js
[20:14:16] <myhrlin> gamerx: this is probably not what you want but I don't really see a problem with the code itself http://dpaste.com/1073924/plain/ try this out
[20:15:59] <myndzi> is there a way to update the destination value of a jquery animation?
[20:17:39] <Denver_> does anyone know why this is firing off infinitely?
[20:17:40] <Denver_> http://pastie.org/private/bdrpinz53e3ahro1zxowa
[20:18:12] <Denver_> it gets theurl but never redirects the page. it just keeps logging the url for ever
[20:18:49] <myndzi> why not just set the window location in the success callback?
[20:18:57] <myndzi> is getNextQuestion being called repeatedly?
[20:19:24] <gamerx> myhrlin: How would that work, which div's would have the fields in them?
[20:19:36] <Denver_> i thought it was being called repeatedly but it isnt. I logged the top when it is called, but it only showed up once
[20:20:03] <myndzi> check chrome's inspector on the network tab to see what the requests are doing
[20:20:23] <myndzi> sounds like possibly a bug or something; success should only be called once
[20:20:40] <myhrlin> gamerx: well I don't know I don't have your sample html code so I just splashed something together
[20:20:54] <myhrlin> and even without having an input field the code still works for me
[20:20:58] <gamerx> myhrlin: https://gamerx.me
[20:21:07] <myhrlin> I should've realized that....
[20:21:12] <gamerx> :P
[20:22:19] <Denver_> it looks like success is being called a ton.
[20:22:43] <myndzi> check the jquery docs for the relevant version
[20:22:55] <myndzi> are you on 2.0? maybe it doesn't do what you think anymore (??)
[20:26:49] <gamerx> It works a little differently than your code does.
[20:28:49] <gamerx> myhrlin: You can see the behaviour a little better here: http://bunbury2100.net/~domenic/test.html
[20:38:52] <myhrlin> gamerx: sorry that took a while
[20:39:26] <myhrlin> just change $(".form").... to $(".form:visible")...
[20:40:43] <gamerx> damn!
[20:40:55] <gamerx> myhrlin: I owe you a beer, Looks fantastic: https://gamerx.me/
[20:41:41] <ezakimak> anyone wanna help me fix a bug in sortable?
[20:41:42] <myhrlin> gamerx: no problem :)
[20:41:58] <myhrlin> ezakimak: show off some cod and someone might be able to help
[20:42:09] <myhrlin> I would be interested but who knows what the future has in store
[20:42:14] <ezakimak> eh, not sure how. have to edit jquery.ui.sortable.js itself
[20:42:17] <myhrlin> just give it a shot and wait
[20:42:25] <myhrlin> oh
[20:42:35] <ezakimak> i've been trying to understand the problem section and fix it, but it's quite opaque
[20:43:09] <ezakimak> around line 847, the else block inside _contactContainers function
[20:43:45] <ezakimak> where it appends it's item to a new container, and computes the 'nearest' item
[20:44:40] <ezakimak> if I could chat w/the code's author, I bet we could fix it in 10-15 min
[21:03:14] <DrPoole> g'day
[21:03:49] <DrPoole> im creating table rows using after().  no problem.  but in one of the rows im trying to create a new table in the <tr><td>
[21:03:59] <DrPoole> and jquery is kicking me in the balls.  it's changing the html.
[21:04:20] <DrPoole> i tried making the row, giving the td and id and then use .html
[21:04:24] <DrPoole> but it's still changing my html
[21:04:26] <DrPoole> driving me nuts
[21:08:15] <Cork> ?p @ DrPoole
[21:08:16] <bot-t> DrPoole, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:09:52] <DrPoole> http://fixee.org/paste/vzcfqj1/
[21:09:55] <DrPoole> forgive the format.
[21:10:00] <DrPoole> it's part of a pretty big function
[21:10:27] <DrPoole> so, im creating a string with the row.  insert.  no problem.  then another row that needs to contain a new table in it
[21:10:59] <DrPoole> errrr....wait a moment
[21:12:15] <DrPoole> ahhhhh ... it's a loop and after i create that table the next after() is throwing it in that table
[21:18:20] * DrPoole goes crosseyed
[21:22:55] <Whirl3d> anybody have any personal experience with using data in a google spreadsheet?
[21:23:32] <Whirl3d> I'm hoping to find a jquery library that easily access Google Spreadsheets and there seems to be a lot of misleading info from Google.
[21:29:49] <Whirl3d> hmm? Anybody have any personal experience with creating timelines using jquery?
[21:31:11] <lenswipee> like a calendar?
[21:31:59] <Whirl3d> Actually, like a timeline. Where across the bottom of the screen are the dates/times and events are marked linearly on the timeline.
[21:33:11] <Whirl3d> http://timeline.verite.co/   looks nice, but I was hoping someone had some experience and knew the ins and outs.
[21:35:00] <lenswipee> use that then
[21:36:43] <Cork> http://freeculture.org/blog/2013/04/23/dont-let-the-myths-fool-you-the-w3cs-plan-for-drm-in-html5-is-a-betrayal-to-all-web-users/
[21:36:48] <Cork> sign up! http://www.defectivebydesign.org/no-drm-in-html5
[21:47:31] <coldhead> cheers Cork
[21:49:50] <nod_> I recommend future of jquery  html5 support ===canvas Tag==== event -getContext -beginPath -arc -fillStyle -fill -stroke -more ===Video Tag==== event -play -stop -record -take photo -more ===audio Tag==== event -play -stop -record -more ==scroll value== -scrollheight -more ================
[21:50:48] <coldhead> nod_: send a pull request https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[21:51:33] <coldhead> I'M UPSET YOU'RE UPSET WHAT'S TO BE DONNNNE
[21:52:22] <Cork> nod_: jquery already supports the events as long as the browser actually produce the event
[22:11:59] <myndzi> if i use the $.on('event', 'selector', fn) form of .on, do i need to also specify the selector when using .off?
[22:12:13] <myndzi> (or can i just specify the function?)
[22:12:24] <Cork> you can't specify the function
[22:12:42] <myndzi> .off( events [, selector ] [, handler(eventObject) ] )
[22:12:49] <myndzi> nm, answered my own question. those brackets aren't nested
[22:13:04] <Cork> damn
[22:13:28] <Cork> found almost a new edge feature every day in jquery this week...
[22:13:40] <myndzi> version added: 1.7
[22:13:54] <Cork> well thats the entire off feature
[22:14:22] <Cork> but it was still true in undelegate
[22:14:43] <coldhead> :P
[22:15:00] <myndzi> i'm pretty sure that syntax worked when it was added heh
[22:15:12] <myndzi> but i'm having trouble finding legacy documentation on api.jquery.com; the links just go to the current
[22:15:26] <Cork> myndzi: i meant that the possibility to use a function has been there for ages
[22:15:36] <myndzi> ah, yeah.
[22:15:43] <myndzi> it's honestly the most sane way of doing it
[22:15:53] <Cork> depends
[22:16:03] <Cork> namespacing is normally the cleanest way
[22:16:18] <myndzi> most sane = most direct
[22:16:22] <Cork> that way you don't have to care about how many handlers you've bound
[22:16:23] <myndzi> didn't necessarily say cleanest ;P
[22:16:35] <myndzi> in this case i'm just ensuring that i don't stack handlers
[22:16:40] <myndzi> so i want to remove the existing one if a new one is requested
[22:16:52] <Cork> on('click.my-events', /* what ever */) off('.my-events')
[22:17:34] <myndzi> think i read that in the docs the other day but didn't have a use for it at the time
[22:17:40] <myndzi> helps here though
[22:18:11] <ezakimak> in a jqui widget, is _create() called once per widget definition, or once per invocation--each time it's added to a diff. node?
[22:19:00] <Cork> ezakimak: it's called once for each element it acts on
[22:19:32] <tw2113> ooh ae we discussing $.each() ?
[22:19:32] <ezakimak> oh dear god. more reasons sortable sucks
[22:19:39] <tw2113> ah, sortable
[22:19:49] * ezakimak is wading through it trying to fix a bug
[22:20:20] <ezakimak> each sortable maintains a list of *all other sortables* and *all their sorted items* they are connected to
[22:21:08] <ezakimak> that makes the big-O on that have an exponent... :(
[22:24:53] <ezakimak> what does $(some el)[0] return?
[22:25:06] <Cork> the pure dom element
[22:27:51] * ezakimak loves undocumented logic
[22:29:43] <coldhead> drop a bell off of the dock
[22:54:57] <coldhead> and when i cut your hair and leave the birds all of the trimmins i am the happiest woman among all women
[23:05:19] <vladikoff> ezakimak, http://api.jquery.com/get/
[23:06:11] <ezakimak> ?
[23:08:52] <coldhead> GODDAMN YOU PEOPLE CAN BE INSCRUTABLE
[23:10:11] <grek> hi i have input witch name="test[ok][]" in possible to convert this inputs values to adday or object ? when i try serialize in aby way i get form[test[ok][]]="value" but i need = form[test][ok][]="value"
[23:11:04] <tw2113> hey coldhead, remember...the name of the band is "Talking Heads"
[23:11:49] <coldhead> truer words
[23:12:11] <ravenzz> grek do you mean names = { test: { ok: value } }; ?
[23:14:39] <grek> yes it can by this way - i have bug form - need get  all input values witch names - namey is arrays,  I neeed - form = get inputs; values = get name = value of inputs , and send - {formInfo:values}
[23:15:28] <grek> when i do it as serialize / serializeObject  / toArray / $(formElements).map(
[23:15:35] <grek> in all way i get wrong names
[23:15:59] <grek> how to get it ? { test: { ok: value } };
[23:16:15] <Cork> grek: there isn't anything premade that will split up the name attributes content
[23:16:45] <coldhead> the human brain can do it
[23:16:52] <coldhead> you just have to believe in yourself
[23:23:34] <ezakimak> grek, what are you attempting, exactly?
[23:34:46] <Nebros> good morning. i have this code http://dpaste.com/1074086/ as css till now. in my form, i have js validate in use. on this pic http://img3.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/12394q86thygd.png , you can see what happen if i tape something in. the information line have to be under the input field and not on the left of it. what i have to do?
[23:36:05] <coldhead> display:block ?
[23:37:29] <Nebros> doesent work with just display:block
[23:37:50] <Nebros> have i to give width?
[23:38:21] <coldhead> i don't know, man, it would be really handy to have an actual live working demo on jsfiddle.net
[23:38:30] <coldhead> because what you have now works fine in my imagination
[23:41:04] <Nebros> =)
[23:41:23] <Nebros> coldhead: this block was a good input
[23:41:47] <Nebros> with width i have it now correct. thank you :)
[23:42:27] <ravenzz> label { float: left; } ?
[23:42:42] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a short break
[23:43:43] <ravenzz> remove that, and add label { display: block; text-align: right; } if you want it to be right aligned (as I can see in from the 1st input)
[23:45:10] <Nebros> the text-align is automatic correct. but if i have not float left, the send button is not on the same line
[23:45:48] <ravenzz> ..
[23:46:40] <ravenzz> that's impossible. maybe other css rules are affecting it
[23:47:08] <coldhead> it's as though there was a cascade of styles
