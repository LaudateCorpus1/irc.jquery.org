[00:38:06] <igyiguygyu> How would one make this an actual countdown with a date? - http://codepen.io/kokozaurz/pen/vOBWxo
[00:40:15] <duch_kazatel> igyiguygyu there's literally no jquery usage in that.  you're probably  better off asking in #css.
[00:40:32] <igyiguygyu> I know - I want to implement a jquery
[00:42:28] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[00:44:59] <igyiguygyu> I want to make this countdown work with jQuery, passing a date to it and countdown accordingly
[00:45:53] <duch_kazatel> why not just find a countdown timer and style it from there?
[00:46:50] <duch_kazatel> or expand this one to include hours, minutes, days, etc.?
[00:48:17] <igyiguygyu> because this one starts counting down form the moment it loads
[00:48:23] <igyiguygyu> and not from the actual time
[01:11:43] <jop008> arthur around?
[01:41:44] <Changa> Hello, I can't get this - alert(this.files[0].size); - to run within this piece of code http://pastebin.com/gEaTGQaK -> error -> TypeError: this.files is undefined.
[02:19:36] <bepolite> Changa: there
[02:19:37] <bepolite> ?
[02:19:55] <Changa> yes, I figured it out bepolite. Thank you.
[02:20:08] <bepolite> :)
[02:20:09] <Changa> var file = $(this).find('input[type="file"]')[0].files[0];
[02:20:11] <Changa> this was it
[02:20:56] <bepolite> Nice XD
[02:28:23] <flexpaint> has anyone successfully used javascript within jpanelmenu?
[02:28:34] <flexpaint> mine disabled everything but gives no console errors...
[03:08:51] <Kitsune> I'm looking for so advice on how to achieve the following: I have JSON data coming in that is a list of recently played songs, these songs include their album and I want create a html list but only create whatever albums had a song played off, to appear on the page only once. (So ignore adding the same album twice) any thoughts of a good approach to doing this?
[03:19:21] <Uhkis> kinda impossible to help without seeing it
[03:21:01] <Uhkis> but in general just remove dupes before listing
[03:24:37] <arthurvr> Kitsune: removing dupes from an array is in general not that difficult.
[03:25:11] <arthurvr> google it, sure stack overflow has this kind of function hanging out
[03:25:28] <Kitsune> I can show the JSON but i havent started on coding anything for it, before I have some kind of efficient plan. http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getrecenttracks&user=rj&api_key=3bf3c70d681eaa418180c03c9ed29912&format=json
[03:25:41] <arthurvr> this might come in handy: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[03:30:57] <Kitsune> So go through each <track> see if its album is already in an array before adding it to the page, how does that sound?
[03:37:59] <arthurvr> Kitsune: reasonable
[03:53:29] <Kitsune> if($.inArray($album, albums) <= -1){ // do stuff then .push into albums } is reasonable enough for me :]
[04:18:50] <luaboy> how to show a table after I click a button on the same page?
[04:19:23] <arthurvr> $(‘button’).click(function () { $(‘table’).show(); });
[04:19:37] <arthurvr> you want to see a fiddle or is that enough?
[04:20:21] <arthurvr> luaboy: ^
[04:21:32] <luaboy> arthurvr:thanks ,a fiddle is best
[04:23:29] <arthurvr> luaboy: http://jsbin.com/bisotisoko/1/
[04:24:55] <luaboy> arthurvr: what is the meaning of '$('table')' ?
[04:25:09] <thaumer> hi guys, how do I prevent a double click on the same element? I want the effect only one time when I switch between the tabs https://gist.github.com/thauma9/4fccfac69966f36b99ed
[04:25:12] <arthurvr> luaboy: it selects the table.
[04:25:22] <luaboy> arthurvr:so why not use name or id ?
[04:25:28] <arthurvr> luaboy: that’s pretty basic so you might want to read up on learn.jquery.com
[04:25:47] <arthurvr> luaboy: why would I for this basic example.
[04:28:15] <luaboy> arthurvr:sorry ,what do you mean ?I can not follow you
[04:28:40] <arthurvr> why would I use an id for such a basic example I mean
[04:29:03] <arthurvr> and, I just said that it’s a basic thing to maybe you might want to read up on the learning center
[04:32:05] <luaboy> arthurvr:ok, thanks
[04:32:40] <luaboy> arthurvr:if I want to show the table at a special position ,how could I do that?
[04:32:54] <arthurvr> that’s more CSS work
[04:33:12] <arthurvr> positioning is styling so move over to #css
[04:33:32] <arthurvr> except if you’d like to animate it or so
[04:34:32] <luaboy> is there div+css available to do custom style?
[04:34:45] <luaboy> with some modification
[04:35:38] <arthurvr> I don’t get you (and as I said basic positioning is out of scope for this channel)
[04:35:58] <luaboy> well
[04:36:06] <luaboy> ok
[05:29:34] <timkofu> hi
[05:29:54] <timkofu> im i doing something dumbu with this code?http://dpaste.com/3TM6FE8
[05:30:07] <timkofu> it's adding a 0 at the end of each number
[05:31:30] <timkofu> hello?
[05:32:16] <sammich> you should use input[type=number]
[05:32:56] <timkofu> doing that ...
[05:33:26] <sammich> gonna need a working sample
[05:35:34] <timkofu> sammich: worked! thanks man
[05:36:36] <thaumer> https://gist.github.com/thauma9/4fccfac69966f36b99ed why here the .on method doesn't work? '.clickme' remains unclickable
[05:42:51] <arthurvr> thaumer: is it showing anything in the console?
[05:43:30] <arthurvr> thaumer: and what’s the deal with line 11?
[05:43:37] <arthurvr> 10 I mean
[05:44:19] <thaumer> arthurvr: I have 2 tabs, and I want to switch between them, but only one click must be allowed each time I switch
[05:44:55] <arthurvr> that doesn’t answer any of both questions. I guess you need .off on line 11?
[05:45:27] <thaumer> but I used .off already on line 5
[05:45:59] <arthurvr> okay but line 11 doesn’t bind anything, you didn’t pass it a handler. http://api.jquery.com/on
[05:58:59] <phutchins> arthurvr: http://jsfiddle.net/5aaPU/285/ <- so I took your advice to do multiple handlers (i think lol) and figured out how I was using .each wrong... Also learned that I needed $(this) insead of this or $this...
[05:59:05] <phutchins> arthurvr: ^ this is what i was going for.
[05:59:24] <arthurvr> looking good :D
[06:01:12] <phutchins> thanks! :)
[06:04:27] <phutchins> arthurvr: i appreciate your help yesterday...
[06:04:41] <arthurvr> haha I wasn’t able to help that much lol
[06:04:45] <arthurvr> but you’re welcome!
[06:44:44] <Nialcen> Hello
[06:45:46] <arthurvr> Hey Nialcen
[06:45:48] <arthurvr> what’s up?
[06:46:04] <Nialcen> I'm looking for a way to make a div follow the mouse cursor, BUT staying within his parent div
[06:46:20] <Nialcen> I'm breaking my mind on this, so I come for a bit pf help
[06:46:22] <Nialcen> ^^
[06:47:46] <Nialcen> <div id="parent"><div id="stalker"></div></div>   : I would like to make stalker following mouse cursor, without going out of parent
[06:48:31] <Nialcen> http://pastebin.com/RgZaape6 : this word for following cursor
[06:48:50] <arthurvr> Nialcen: do you mean like this http://jsbin.com/zimisoyuyo/1/
[06:48:53] <Nialcen> but I'm unable to make it only within the parent div ^^
[06:49:34] <Nialcen> Yeah !! But without click
[06:49:46] <Nialcen> only on hover :)
[06:49:56] <Nialcen> but that's exactly what I need
[06:50:08] <arthurvr> what’s your use case if I may ask that?
[06:50:52] <Nialcen> You could ! I'm working ' as an exercise ) on a tileset map creator online
[06:51:04] <Nialcen> I select the tile I want
[06:51:36] <Nialcen> then I Hover the map div, where I will "draw" my map, using the selected tile
[06:52:07] <Nialcen> I have to use the click for draw, so I have to use Hover for moving the div
[06:53:29] <Nialcen> Oh I see it's a specific event .draggable
[06:53:55] <Nialcen> arthurvr : have you any idea on the same only on hover ?
[06:54:28] <arthurvr> Nialcen: It’s not an event, draggable is a jQuery UI interaction
[06:54:40] <arthurvr> Please refer to http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[06:54:52] <Nialcen> Sorry, my bad
[06:55:20] <Nialcen> Is something existing without click only on hover ?
[06:55:27] <arthurvr> On hover should be possible but not much time to dig in at the moment
[06:56:22] <Nialcen> Ok thank you
[06:58:57] <dan_j> Hi, I know there is slideUp/slideDown. Is it possible to slideleft/slideright along with a fadein/out?
[07:07:04] <arthurvr> dan_j: we don’t have a build-in function for that, but you could use .animate() I guess.
[07:07:49] <arthurvr> dan_j: or https://jqueryui.com/effect/. check the first demo on `drop`.
[07:08:28] <dan_j> Perfect. Thanks
[07:08:36] <arthurvr> yw dan_j

[11:29:08] <daimon> I'm back, sorry
[11:29:16] <daimon> I logged with my nick
[11:30:19] <daimon> I'm developing stuff like "check if nick/email is already taken"
[11:30:42] <daimon> "email and password match" et cetera
[11:31:36] <daimon> althought I've an empty database, nicks and emails seems already registered
[11:31:39] <daimon> wtf?
[11:36:24] <_maz> hi, when I add a row to a table via $("#mytable tbody").append(<content>) the button in <content> does not fire a jquery method $('button.btnDelete').on('click', function (e) {    however, the statically generate row button works ok.. why? http://jsfiddle.net/ajLom06h/
[11:37:15] <_maz> I would expect the dynamically-created button to fire the method .on method
[11:37:29] <daimon> guys??
[11:38:04] <_maz> this is in Chrome
[11:41:05] <Meir`> _maz, please create a testcase
[11:42:15] <Meir`> _maz, read here: http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[11:44:07] <_maz> Meir`: ok I'll make a decent test case
[11:45:10] <daimon_> why my captha doesn't work?
[11:46:15] <daimon_> I mean, is upand running in my page but if I push the submit button without the captcha test the form goes on anyway
[11:50:35] <DeltaHeavy> When attaching an event handler on a single event is it still best to use .on()? If so why?
[12:04:20] <rcyr> DeltaHeavy: Is there anything else but on?
[12:04:44] <rcyr> .on covers both "normal" event handlers and delegated event handlers
[12:05:33] <DeltaHeavy> rcyr: Could use click()
[12:07:49] <_maz> Meir`: I made it a lot better. This jsfiddle demonstrates the issue much more clearly: http://jsfiddle.net/ajLom06h/27/
[12:08:37] <rcyr> DeltaHeavy: That's just a normal event handler... and IMHO, why would I use .click when .on is like... 3 characters more and is much more flexible.
[12:08:58] <rcyr> In CS, there aren't many silver bullets... but when I find one, I use the hell out of it.
[12:10:02] <DeltaHeavy> rcyr: Besides for the character difference what are the advantages of using .on when it's only ever going to be fired from a single unique element though?
[12:10:43] <_maz> I'll repeat my original question for the benefit of others:  when I add a row to a table via $("#mytable tbody").append(<content>) the button in <content> does not fire a jquery method http://jsfiddle.net/ajLom06h/27/
[12:12:13] <rcyr> DeltaHeavy: As a human being, my brain capacity is limited... I'd rather just remember a single function that does it all than a lot of "cute name" that do the same. It has another nice side-effect, when I "search files" for event handlers, I can only look for .on( instead of .click .change .hover .mousedown etc..
[12:12:36] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: $('#mytable').on('click', '.btnDelete', function () {...});
[12:12:50] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: Also don't have multiple elements with the same ID like you have on #btnDelete
[12:13:18] <DeltaHeavy> rcyr: I agree, I'm just wondering if there's anything more as to why it's the preferred method.
[12:14:29] <DeltaHeavy> I like to make my code as consistant with the status quo as possible. I also understand and agree with your reasoning. I just thought there'd be something a little more to it.
[12:14:37] <DeltaHeavy> Kinda wonder why they weren't taken out in jQ 2.0.
[12:15:47] <Meir`> _maz that's indeed strange
[12:15:47] <rcyr> DeltaHeavy: It was just a way to unify all the previous attempts at event handling....
[12:16:08] <DeltaHeavy> Meir`: Did you read my response? Seems fairly clear to me.
[12:16:14] <rcyr> DeltaHeavy: At one point, jQuery had the "nice names"(.click/.change/etc), it has .bind and .live and .delegate
[12:16:38] <rcyr> s/has/had
[12:17:00] <rcyr> That was becoming a bit confusing...
[12:17:16] <rcyr> They created .on as a way to consolidate all those.
[12:17:45] <coldhead> .on ring to to rule them all
[12:18:38] <_maz> DeltaHeavy: you said (a) $('#mytable').on('click', '.btnDelete', function () {...});    and (b) Also don't have multiple elements with the same ID like you have on #btnDelete ..
[12:18:52] <_maz> do I need to implement (b) for (a) to work?
[12:19:01] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: Nope
[12:19:22] <DeltaHeavy> ID's just straight up won't work if they're not unique.
[12:19:49] <_maz> because (a) alone in the test case has no effect
[12:20:17] <_maz> (still not deleting dynamic row)
[12:21:28] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: It is for me - https://jsfiddle.net/ajLom06h/29/
[12:22:15] <Meir`> DeltaHeavy, the selector is for "button.btnDelete", and although he applied same class on the <tr>, it should trigger
[12:22:23] <Meir`> that's what was strange to me
[12:22:47] <julcsi> Hi, I’m a beginner and I have a problem with the following script. the window(scroll) doesn’t want to run the set_menu_opacity function. Could you help me? https://bpaste.net/show/3d93f2d5248b
[12:22:51] <Meir`> when inspecting the DOM, there was an added button with that class
[12:22:53] <DeltaHeavy> Meir`: Oh wait yeah...that's odd
[12:23:08] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: I wouldn't use the class 'btnDelete' on that <tr> at all. DOn't reuse classes like that.
[12:23:26] <Meir`> DeltaHeavy, now you're a bit wrong
[12:23:28] <DeltaHeavy> If you need to apply some CSS on it I'd just #myTable tr
[12:23:38] <DeltaHeavy> Meir`: With regards to what?
[12:23:52] <Meir`> same classe can be applied freely on different kinds of dom elements
[12:24:08] <Meir`> that's why you can select with "element.class"
[12:24:34] <Meir`> what if i have a class "rounded" to add round corners?
[12:24:51] <Meir`> and i want spesifically to select "p.rounded"?
[12:25:02] <DeltaHeavy> Meir`: Oh you can, I just think in this specific case it's not a good idea.
[12:25:27] <DeltaHeavy> Classes are MADE for that. This just isn't a good use of it. Sorry if I was unclear. Do you agree or no?
[12:25:58] <_maz> DeltaHeavy: so in terms of maintainability, I should simply do away with tr class="btnDelete"
[12:26:00] <_maz> ?
[12:26:04] <Meir`> i agree it's not commmon when a class is connected ideally to some element
[12:26:09] <Meir`> like sort of id
[12:26:39] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: It's just bad CSS.
[12:26:54] <Meir`> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists
[12:26:58] <Meir`> like in this example
[12:27:05] <DeltaHeavy> Why is .btnDelete on there? The class name doesn't even describe what it is as a row of that table has more than just a delete button.
[12:27:10] <Meir`> when using a unique class for "connectWith"
[12:27:41] <DeltaHeavy> I honestly rarely but classes on table elements as they're easily selected like '#myTable tr' '#myTable td'
[12:28:09] <_maz> DeltaHeavy: got it, it's potentially confusing and perhaps will generate a side-effect
[12:28:51] <_maz> I removed it and the functionality remains
[12:29:59] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: Does my jsfiddle work for you?
[12:30:14] <DeltaHeavy> https://jsfiddle.net/ajLom06h/29/
[12:30:47] <_maz> yes, 29 does. strangely though mine, http://jsfiddle.net/ajLom06h/31/, does not
[12:31:23] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: Check your console
[12:31:29] <DeltaHeavy> ALWAYS check your console for errors :p
[12:31:32] <DeltaHeavy> ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS
[12:32:04] <_maz> ReferenceError: Can't find variable: e
[12:32:10] <_maz> yeah
[12:32:33] <_maz> forgot to send in e
[12:32:59] <_maz> thanks again .. appreciate the wisdom and next time I'll make a good testcase from the get-go
[12:34:25] <DeltaHeavy> _maz: No problem
[12:54:31] <Vukan> hello
[12:55:40] <Vukan> i have a while loop going through date range and i'm trying to uncheck checkboxes with dates in range
[12:56:10] <Vukan> now, this explicit selector in loop  $("#2015-05-17").prop("checked", false); works
[12:56:23] <Vukan> but this $( "#bam2" ).prop("checked", false); is not working
[12:56:50] <Vukan> bam2 is var that is incrementing date
[12:56:56] <Vukan> it is of type string
[13:00:19] <DeltaHeavy> Vukan: You'd probalby want to pastebin your code somewhere like refheap.com
[13:00:43] <arthurvr> DeltaHeavy: even better, do a jsbin/jsfiddle
[13:00:52] <arthurvr> ?paste @ Vukan
[13:00:52] <b-ot> Vukan: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:04:52] <Vukan> arthurvr: how about pastebin http://pastebin.com/HGgTZaBf
[13:05:10] <arthurvr> well a bin or a fiddle is always better but that’s okay lol
[13:05:16] <Vukan> code is heavy with php framework
[13:05:23] <arthurvr> that shouldn’t make sense
[13:05:35] <Vukan> what?
[13:06:05] <Vukan> mind you, i'm beginner with JS so code is a mess :(
[13:06:21] <Vukan> but this is working version
[13:09:57] <Vukan> arthurvr: ??
[13:10:15] <arthurvr> yup Vukan what’s up?
[13:11:35] <Vukan> can you help me with this code?
[13:12:44] <arthurvr> Vukan: I’d love to but am just limited in time lol there are 700 other people who’d like to help you I guess?
[13:13:16] <Vukan> okay
[13:14:00] <bepolite> arthurvr: You're the one he wants
[13:14:06] <bepolite> lol
[13:14:14] <arthurvr> haha bepolite
[13:14:49] <Kartagis> I'm running the code at http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/q8Lf96ud/ in a phonegap project. I use two different linux distros when working with phonegap and everything except that is the same (cordova version and cordova android platform version). the js file that works on mint doesn't work on ubuntu when I build the .apk. does this make sense at all?
[14:29:02] <Zeranoe> It seems that a required input element (<select required>) will break submision even if the element is hidden with .hide(). Is there any way around this? I would like to be able to hide different elements of a form, and bring them back if needed.
[14:38:46] <bepolite> Zeranoe: how are you hiding the elements?
[14:39:05] <bepolite> Another way will be to add the required attribute to the elements only after you reveal them
[14:39:10] <bepolite> A fiddle will be awesome
[14:39:37] <Zeranoe> The elements are hidden on the change event of a <select>
[14:40:08] <Zeranoe> depending on the value, some elements are shown and some hidden
[14:45:19] <bepolite> Zeranoe: are you hiding elements with  $('element').hide()?
[14:45:30] <Zeranoe> yes
[14:48:36] <bepolite> You could also do  $).removeAttr('required');
[14:48:51] <bepolite> Zeranoe:  $('selector').removeAttr('required');
[14:48:59] <bepolite> But a fiddle will be nice
[14:49:33] <bepolite> Basically the workaround is to remove the required attribute before hiding the element
[14:52:09] <Zeranoe> bepolite: Or use .detach perhaps?
[14:52:31] <drepnir> I have a strange problem with chrome and jquery 1.9.1 . I get an exception on this line when I include jquery. 1330: a.style.cssText = "top:1px;float:left;opacity:.5"; Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'cssText' of null  .. Anyone had this problem?
[15:01:03] <bepolite> maybe Zeranoe
[15:01:24] <bepolite> If you could provide a fiddle, I could help you more
[15:01:49] <bepolite> drepnir: can you do a fiddle
[15:01:52] <bepolite> ?
[15:03:46] <bepolite> drepnir:  try  $('a').css('cssText',    "top:1px;float:left;opacity:.5"  );
[15:11:23] <goon_thug> $.fn.emulateTransitionEnd = function (duration) {
[15:11:23] <goon_thug>                             ^
[15:11:23] <goon_thug> TypeError: Cannot set property 'emulateTransitionEnd' of undefined
[15:11:43] <goon_thug> why is this happening?
[15:18:01] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know how difficult it would be to convert the javascript into angularJS - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/tree/master/src/js
[15:18:31] <jeffreylevesque> maybe more specifically, convert 'html_form.js' into angularJS equivalent - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form.js
[15:35:00] <Zeranoe> Could this be done any cleaner? https://jsfiddle.net/bg9jfhxy/ bepolite
[15:35:20] <bepolite> leme check Zeranoe
[15:48:09] <bepolite> Zeranoe: so basically, when a users selects an option, the value shiould be diplayed in the form?
[15:49:28] <Zeranoe> It's more complicated then that in my actual program. Basically each <div> that is being displayed/hidden contains different form data to be filled out
[15:56:33] <bepolite> hmm
[15:58:50] <bepolite> Zeranoe: well there's no need using the action variables since they are used just once
[15:59:47] <Zeranoe> bepolite: What do you mean? They need to be set to store the element's information so it can be used later?
[16:00:00] <bepolite> Ahh forgot
[16:01:02] <bepolite> Another suggestion will be to delete lines 4 and 5  and change it to
[16:01:05] <bepolite> $( "#40422, #40454" ).detach();
[16:02:04] <Zeranoe> bepolite: Could I do anything with arrays to get rid of that if/else if ?
[16:05:41] <bepolite> Zeranoe: I was thinking of an objet
[16:05:45] <bepolite> hello DreadKnight
[16:05:49] <bepolite> Are you from Nigeria?
[16:07:44] <DreadKnight> very
[16:09:46] <bepolite> Zeranoe: https://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/bg9jfhxy/1/
[16:09:58] <bepolite> Hmm DreadKnight do you live in Nigeria presently?
[16:10:15] <Zeranoe> bepolite: Thanks, that's what I was looking for
[16:10:49] <DreadKnight> bepolite, want to send you a postcard or what? xD
[16:11:13] <bepolite> LOL DreadKnight
[16:11:33] <bepolite> I'm just exited to see the vareity of people here
[16:11:48] <DreadKnight> :D woah
[16:12:18] <drepnir> Can anyone speculate to guess why jquery loads fine here http://localhost:8080/test.html , but not here: http://37.191.134.8:8080/app/test ?
[16:12:31] <drepnir> http://37.191.134.8:8080/test.html i mean
[16:13:28] <bepolite> drepnir: You have <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js"/>
[16:13:48] <bepolite> Instead of <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
[16:24:54] <drepnir> seems like my jsp compiler optimized the script tag to a single element, i avoided that by putting a comment in the script tag now, but still it doesn't want to load correctly.
[16:28:55] <bepolite> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js">/* */</script> is different from  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
[16:29:01] <bepolite> drepnir: ^
[16:32:33] <bepolite> hmm DreadKnight You live in Romania?
[16:33:00] <drepnir> hmm.. works with test.html to put /**/ in between the script tags. I think it's pretty strange
[16:34:34] <DreadKnight> bepolite, lots of nigerians here studying medicine
[16:35:55] <bepolite> drepnir: JQuery is loaded here http://37.191.134.8:8080/app/test
[16:36:11] <drepnir> it works for you?
[16:39:50] <bepolite> Sorry I mixed the links drepnir
[16:40:30] <drepnir> http://37.191.134.8:8080/app/test
[16:40:58] <drepnir> oh
[16:41:02] <drepnir> mixed, not missed :)

[17:22:53] <jquery334> How can I modify meta in the <head> tags? Im appending a meta to have a desktop view button on my mobile view, but it blinks to desktop for a split second then goes to mobile/
[18:37:35] <Shebbi> hi, are links automatically escaped in AJAX return functions?
[18:40:59] <Shebbi> hi, when I echo a link say, <a href="#">My Link</a>, in an ajax return/response function and append that data in HTML the link gets escaped as it's not clickable.
[18:42:22] <bepolite> Shebbi: How does your server return he data
[18:42:31] <bepolite> normally, JSON data is excaped
[18:42:55] <Shebbi> the server is returning it as <a href="#">My Link</a>
[18:43:37] <bepolite> Shebbi:  then how are you appending the data in your html?
[18:43:47] <bepolite> Can you create a fiddle?
[18:44:04] <bepolite> Shebbi: which format does your server return the data in?
[18:44:16] <Shebbi> server-side: echo '<a href="'.home_url( '/print-cards/?file='.$file_name ).'">Print Cards</a>';
[18:44:52] <Shebbi> client-side: ...text($data)
[18:45:03] <bepolite> Shebbi: thats the problem
[18:45:11] <bepolite> Use .html($data)
[18:45:38] <Shebbi> right, what;s happening with ..text($data)?
[18:45:53] <bepolite> Shebbi:  when you use "$.text($data", jquery excapes  the data
[18:46:01] <bepolite> ?api text @ Shebbi
[18:46:01] <b-ot> Shebbi: .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[18:46:17] <Shebbi> let me check it out, thanks!
[18:47:29] <Shebbi> bepolite: where it says it escapes it? i don't see it
[18:48:27] <bepolite> "We need to be aware that this method escapes the string provided as necessary so that it will render correctly in HTML"
[18:48:34] <bepolite> Shebbi: ^^
[18:48:38] <bepolite> Search for that string
[18:49:38] <Shebbi> bepolite: thanks again. you're my best friend now.
[18:49:47] <bepolite> haahhahahhaah
[18:50:09] <bepolite> no problem Shebbi that's what we're here for
[18:50:47] <Shebbi> bepolite: your a regular or a senior here? don't recall being blessed with your help before.
[18:51:53] <bepolite> LOL I'm a learner Shebbi
[18:52:14] <bepolite> I'm new year though I've mostly been at #web
[18:52:26] <Shebbi> how long you been using jquery?
[18:56:59] <igyiguygyu> how would I add to this code not only that it reacts to click but also the left & right arrow keys for next/prev buttons? https://jsfiddle.net/4y8b3z5g/
[19:03:12] <bepolite> Shebbi: 3 years
[19:06:42] <bepolite> igyiguygyu: 2 options  Use a plugin that does the Job of firing the click event or another event when the arrow keys are pressed. Or you could use the capture the keypress events yourself
[19:09:27] <igyiguygyu> bepolite: what's the most efficient way?
[19:09:41] <bepolite> depends on you igyiguygyu
[19:10:37] <bepolite> igyiguygyu: you want to create someting like a gallery?
[19:11:23] <igyiguygyu> Kind of. I have bunch of peoples profiles that open up when clicked on thumbnail. There's next/prev button to move between the profiles so I was just thinking that by adding key functionality would give a nice touch
[19:12:16] <bepolite> igyiguygyu: THis is a simple way to capture the arrow keys http://stackoverflow.com/a/2260937/2561122
[19:12:49] <igyiguygyu> but does it still work on click events too?
[19:13:28] <bepolite> hmmmm
[19:13:37] <bepolite> Click is diffrent from arrow keys
[19:15:34] <igyiguygyu> yeah so I have 2 buttons - next/prev
[19:15:41] <igyiguygyu> right now it works on click events just as I need
[19:15:52] <igyiguygyu> but I want to add additional left right arrow key functionality to that
[19:17:40] <bepolite> igyiguygyu:  sample https://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/4y8b3z5g/1/
[19:18:07] <bepolite> You will need to tweak it a little but I hope you understand the conecpt
[19:20:04] <igyiguygyu> hmm lemme try
[19:21:11] <bepolite> Nice
[19:21:21] <bepolite> It wouldn't work as it is though
[19:22:54] <igyiguygyu> yeah i realized just now
[19:24:13] <bepolite> But the basic idea is to abstract out the function that changes the thumbnails
[19:24:31] <bepolite> Then you would call this function each time the user clicks on the next/previous button
[19:24:50] <bepolite> and each time the user presses the right/left arrow key
[19:25:31] <igyiguygyu> Yeah, i'll need to write a html markup and just play with it in jsfiddle
[19:25:34] <igyiguygyu> thanks!
[19:25:37] <bepolite> np
[19:37:26] <Peter_Occ> This ignores the first integer, but is triggered on the second integer. Why would it do that? jQuery(".calc-row input").on('keydown', function() {
[19:40:20] <Shebbi> is there a jquery function that can check if a string starts with say 'foo'?
[22:50:18] <jquery150> Hey, how can I get encoded json from a php script without using get or post? I have my php script on the same page as my jquery to decode the json, how can I do this?
[22:54:23] <kschlesselmann> jquery150: But PHP is server side and js client side … you have to issue some http requests
[22:55:16] <jquery150> True.. if I do a foreach inside my script tags and print_r the results of my array? Could that work?
[22:55:48] <jquery150> http://hastebin.com/hisonumefe.php
[22:55:50] <jquery150> I got this
[22:56:09] <kschlesselmann> ahhh, yeah that'll work on initial page load
[22:56:18] <jquery150> thats what I want ^>^
[22:56:22] <kschlesselmann> yep
[22:56:26] <kschlesselmann> should work
[22:56:27] <jquery150> Is there I can debug the var?
[22:56:32] <jquery150> other than console.log
[22:57:09] <kschlesselmann> not sure … i suppose firebug or whatever can debug js … (I'm just starting out myself)
[22:57:17] <jquery150> Ah, cheers :P
[22:57:22] <jquery150> gl ^.^
[22:57:26] <jquery150> Its a bit of a hassle sometimes
[23:47:35] <hollusion> is $.each() async?
[23:50:26] <Siente> good morning guys, 1 fast question why is this not working if ($('.first').children('.flight-table').length > 1) { $('.remove').hide(); }
[23:50:44] <Siente> I mean < 1
[23:53:50] <hollusion> Siente: please paste the html code or even better: make a jsfiddle
[23:58:09] <hollusion> Siente: you can also just do: if ($(element).length) { ... } or if (!$(element).length) { ... }
[23:59:48] <TheHackOps> I am using telerik, I have a client template that is mean to pop a .dialog() on("click"...)
