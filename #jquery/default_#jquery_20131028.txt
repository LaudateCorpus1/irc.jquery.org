[01:51:53] <donkeycongo> Can I bind to elements that are detached from the DOM?
[02:02:50] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/S4TEX/ <-- how do I remove an element from a larger scope using mouseenter and leave?
[02:03:53] <DRSK> basically I don't want anything to fire on ".two", even though I've set it not to include .two, a bit confused. Probably because I'm on a parent, but how can I force .two not to fire? :o
[02:09:37] <Cork> DRSK: you can't
[02:09:48] <Cork> you would have to use mouseover mouseout
[02:10:06] <Cork> and then check the event.target if it is inside the .two
[02:10:09] <DRSK> Ah, and if I do, how do I remove it from wrapper?
[02:10:27] <Cork> DRSK: also you don't need to use a $() for not()
[02:10:47] <anli> Hm, would be nice if I could see in firebug which styles that are fetched from a certain css file (and are not overridden)
[02:11:00] <Cork> anli: you can
[02:11:07] <anli> How do I do that?
[02:11:16] <Cork> should be visible in the html view
[02:11:19] <Cork> right side
[02:11:26] <anli> Yeah, but there are a plenty
[02:11:30] <Cork> (the file is in blue)
[02:11:45] <Cork> and the rules that is overriden is stroked through
[02:11:51] <anli> They are marked with overstrike, but I want to know that I am finished putting all those styles in my <style> tag instead
[02:12:05] <anli> I am creating a minimal error reproduction
[02:12:13] <Cork> what?
[02:12:24] <Cork> the selector has what file it came from
[02:12:29] <Cork> what more do you need?
[02:12:31] <anli> I have a css related problem and my SO-posting will only contain the html file
[02:12:44] <anli> So I am putting styles from the css file in my html
[02:12:53] <DRSK> Cork » http://jsfiddle.net/S4TEX/1/ < so I set it to .not( '.two' ) but it still seems to fire on it?
[02:12:57] <anli> What I want to know is if I am finished
[02:13:03] <Cork> so make sure all the rules from the css file is stroked through
[02:13:11] <anli> Yeah, but I dont want to manually check those
[02:13:22] <Cork> manually?
[02:13:30] <Cork> just look in the list it gives you for the element >_<
[02:13:37] <anli> Yes, but clicking all elements and checking if every rule is overstroke
[02:13:58] <anli> Would be nice to get a list of css rules from the css file that still have some effect
[02:14:05] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/S4TEX/2/ works though, no?
[02:14:06] <Cork> anli: rules doesn't override before they are on an element
[02:14:15] <Cork> so you can't know that before you check on an element
[02:14:22] <Cork> the browser doesn't know it
[02:14:25] <anli> They override if I include them in my html file after I use the <link> tag
[02:14:25] <seutje> or was that not what was intended?
[02:14:38] <Cork> anli: no they include the css source
[02:14:39] <anli> First <link> then <style> in my html
[02:14:45] <Cork> the override happens on the element
[02:14:54] <anli> The style tag should include all those styles that are in the css
[02:15:03] <anli> I am not sure we are talking about the same thing here
[02:15:06] <Mi|{y> hi
[02:15:08] <seutje> DRSK: .wapper is a parent of .two, so the .not() won't exclude it as it isn't included to begin with
[02:15:08] <DRSK> seutje » yes if I could somehow also include .wrapper in that
[02:15:40] <Cork> anli: firebug gives you a list of all the css loaded, from an element you can get what css is applied and overriden on that specific element
[02:15:50] <seutje> DRSK: u don't want the leave to fire when entering .two?
[02:16:02] <DRSK> seutje » everything in wrapper should trigger except .two
[02:16:02] <Cork> anli: css rules doesn't match each other they match elements
[02:16:16] <anli> Yes, I already know that, what I want to know is if the inclusion of the css file still has some effect, or if I am finished putting all those styles as inline
[02:16:18] <seutje> DRSK: the link I pasted does exactly that
[02:16:19] <Cork> anli: so before you check from the point of an element you have no override
[02:16:33] <DRSK> seutje » even, wrapper itself - or if everything else but the wrapper would mean basically the wrapper but not .two
[02:16:40] <Cork> anli: then check from the point of an element, cause before that there isn't anything to check
[02:16:51] <DRSK> seutje » well I'd want it to be "hovering" on the black area as well if possible
[02:16:57] <seutje> DRSK: how can you hover .two without going over the edge of the wrapper?
[02:17:26] <anli> Hm, I am not getting myself understood
[02:17:33] <anli> Must accept that, I think
[02:17:58] <Mi|{y> http://jsfiddle.net/83fts/2/ why alert always show "form1"?
[02:18:57] <DRSK> seutje » basically if I'm on the wrapper it should be "hovering" but if I hover .two it'd be leaving until I come to the wrapper or outsite again. In the code I'm trying to use I've got more than .nav within wrapper
[02:19:28] <seutje> Mi|{y: ur htmls are malformed
[02:19:50] <DRSK> .wrapper (except a descendant called .two) mouseover == hovering, mouseout not :)
[02:19:55] <seutje> <form id="form1"> never closes
[02:19:58] <Mi|{y> :P     </form>
[02:20:06] <Mi|{y> thx seutje
[02:22:11] <jop008> I want to loop over my form fields I use   $(":input", form).filter('.required').each(function () { must I use additional filter on textarea field?
[02:22:14] <seutje> DRSK: yeah, like cork said, that's now how enter/leave works
[02:25:32] <seutje> DRSK: you'll have to manually catch the double triggering though: http://jsfiddle.net/S4TEX/4/
[02:27:14] <DRSK> seutje » I kinda get it, but then again I don't. In this case you provided, what I need would be on wrapper, hoverstate. on .one, hoverstate. from one or wrapper > .two, leaving. otherwise, hover.
[02:28:53] <seutje> DRSK: so debounce whatever sets ur hoverstate
[02:29:31] <seutje> or just use regular hover and reverse the handling on .two
[02:30:38] <seutje> the latter will probably explode as soon as they tab out
[02:31:12] <DRSK> can I show you a live example perhaps ?
[02:32:00] <DRSK> the only thing wrong atm is when I hover a specific element, it goes from hovering > leaving > hovering again, and I'd just like it to stay hovering. Like you said, some kind of debouncing somehow
[02:32:51] <Cork> DRSK: mouseenter/mouseleave works by checking mouseover/mouseout abd if event.target == this; and if it isn't doesn't trigger the enter/leave event
[02:33:20] <donkeycongo> Can I bind to an element that is detached from the DOM?
[02:33:24] <Cork> DRSK: so if you need a more complex relation you would have to base it on mouseover/mouseout and it would be possible to do it that way
[02:33:36] <Cork> donkeycongo: yes, but you won't get any events on it
[02:33:59] <Cork> that is events won't trigger on them before they are in the document
[02:35:06] <donkeycongo> Cork: Am I supposed to use a specific approach? Cause my script isnt working
[02:35:28] <Cork> donkeycongo: as long as you are working with elements and not html it should just work
[02:35:36] <donkeycongo> hmm
[02:35:43] <donkeycongo> Must be doing something else wrong then
[02:35:46] <donkeycongo> Thanks, Cork
[02:35:57] <Cork> that is $(html).on() append(html) won't work
[02:36:29] <Cork> while var newContent = $(html); newContent.on() append(newContent) will
[02:37:46] <seutje> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/S4TEX/6/ there
[02:37:59] <seutje> addClass doesn't care if it triggers again anyway
[02:38:12] <anli> I want to make a stack overflow posting of my webpage, but is there a way to scramble the text contents?
[02:38:33] <anli> Or just replace it with nonsense
[02:38:55] <seutje> anli: give all ur text a blurred shadow in the same color as the text
[02:39:02] <anli> hehe
[02:39:07] <anli> I will post the source code
[02:39:24] <seutje> then u can even set the font color to transparent and it'll be pretty blurry
[02:39:32] <anli> lol
[02:39:32] <seutje> did that for aprilfools.css :P
[02:39:47] <anli> Yeah, the source code will get really blurry that way
[02:40:35] <seutje> oh, u mean source code
[02:41:13] <seutje> just asplode all textnodes or replace them with *this is a textnode*
[02:42:11] <seutje> DRSK: u can set the timeout down to 0 btw, forgot to change that
[02:42:39] <DRSK> seutje » yeah I get the debouncing part but that's not where I'm having issues atm ;D
[02:50:48] <repatilian> I have a question about sliding in to a certain point.  Could anybody help me?
[02:51:04] <Cork> ?ask @ repatilian
[02:51:04] <b-ot> repatilian: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:52:04] <krz> give the following string "/foo/bar/path/baz.jpg" are there any File libs to parse through this string?
[02:52:34] <repatilian> How do you get an image to slide in to a certain point, like 50px's from top and 500 px's from left?
[02:52:49] <Cork> krz: look for an uri parser
[02:53:25] <repatilian> Thanks cork
[02:53:35] <krz> Cork: external lib?
[02:53:37] <krz> or internal
[02:54:52] <Cork> krz: to what point do you want to split it?
[02:55:15] <krz> get the basename, extension, and path
[02:55:24] <krz> i found purl
[02:55:30] <krz> looks interesting
[02:55:36] <krz> but wondering if there is something better
[02:56:08] <Cork> krz: you could give http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/parseuri a try
[02:56:20] <Cork> krz: also remember that that info doesn't have to be correct
[02:56:28] <intellilogic> is it possible to get $(this) from the callee of a function without passing it?
[02:56:34] <Cork> the url doesn't mean anything for what content is sent
[02:57:04] <Cork> intellilogic: var self = $(this); child: self.find()
[02:57:18] <Cork> as in store it in a none this related variable
[02:57:31] <Cork> as this is overriden by default in functions
[03:00:12] <krz> so i got it working with purl. whats the idea?
[03:00:18] <krz> how would i get basename and ext?
[03:00:26] <krz> do i have to do some splits?
[03:00:29] <krz> regex?
[03:00:49] <Cork> the code is right there just read it :)
[03:02:13] <krz> ah nvm
[03:02:18] <krz> they have a file method
[03:02:30] <intellilogic> Cork: that didn't really answer my question, I could just pass $(this) as an object paramiter to the function...  I want to get $(this) of the callee without it having the be submitted.
[03:02:49] <Cork> ?p @ intellilogic
[03:02:55] <Cork> ugg
[03:03:08] <Cork> intellilogic: paste your code in jsfiddle.net and paste the link here
[03:05:00] <intellilogic> No code.  Foo($(this), "stuff");  function Foo(obj, string){ obj <- have this.   But I'd lIKE to get it from the call it so I can do Foo("stuff") function Foo(string){ //get the $(this) from the callee anyhow ;)
[03:05:22] <intellilogic> I think maybe it's not possible.
[03:05:31] <Cork> intellilogic: are you looking for .call()?
[03:05:42] <seutje> Foo.call(this, 'stuff')?
[03:05:51] <seutje> damnit cork, every time
[03:06:07] <Cork> function foo(s) { $(this).text(s); }; foo.call(this, "stuff");
[03:06:26] <seutje> the capital is confusing though, cause this won't work as a constructor
[03:06:32] <intellilogic> seutje: I considered that, but I'd really like to avoid having the user submit $(this) all together, I am just using it for logging
[03:06:49] <seutje> I'm confused now
[03:07:03] <Cork> intellilogic: you can't magically inherit values through a function call
[03:07:22] <seutje> are you making ur using write code? o.O
[03:07:31] <Cork> only option is scope (and that is what i showed before)
[03:07:39] <intellilogic> I was hoping...  I pulled other info :-/
[03:07:55] <intellilogic> Running stuff like this for log:  var lib_info=arguments.callee.caller.toString().match(/([A-Z0-9]+)_[A-Z0-9]+="([^"]+)/i);
[03:07:56] <intellilogic> heh
[03:08:13] <intellilogic> GIVE ME DATAZ
[03:08:34] <krz> got the following string "oiuwoias8as6d8761278341_foo.jpg" how can i retrieve just the token?
[03:08:45] <seutje> intellilogic: should definitely avoid that
[03:08:51] <Cork> intellilogic: you should not use callee, it has been depricated and will not work in newer versions of js
[03:08:54] <intellilogic> krz RegEx
[03:09:04] <krz> other alternatives?
[03:09:15] <Cork> krz: none really
[03:09:16] <krz> thinking of using substr + lastindexof
[03:09:26] <intellilogic> Cork: good to know, alternatives?  I am just trying to write some little dev log tool thing
[03:09:39] <intellilogic> krz don't be a sissy, regex is awesome :)
[03:09:39] <Cork> intellilogic: use named function calls
[03:09:50] <Cork> intellilogic: just structure your code differently
[03:10:21] <intellilogic> I'm trying to keep the logging unobtrusive
[03:10:28] <Cork> it was deprecated cause it was impossible to optimize it so engines was forced to use slow paths for function executions
[03:10:59] <Cork> intellilogic: value passing should always be explicit
[03:11:26] <krz> intellilogic: give it to me then
[03:11:51] <Cork> krz: /(([0-9]+)/
[03:12:00] <Cork> hmm
[03:12:02] <Cork> actually
[03:12:05] <seutje> there's an 8as in there
[03:12:14] <Cork> what part of that is the filename is the hash?
[03:12:20] <seutje> I'm not even clear if the foo is part of the hash
[03:12:23] <Cork> *token
[03:12:28] <seutje> *token
[03:12:30] <seutje> :P
[03:12:34] <intellilogic> krz:  var string="oiuwoias8as6d8761278341_foo.jpg", foo = string.match(/([A-Z0-9]+)_/i); foo[1];
[03:12:42] <Cork> cause i would prob just use split
[03:12:49] <krz> even a str.split('_')[0] gets me the token nicely
[03:12:54] <krz> why would i need to use regex
[03:12:57] <Cork> don't
[03:13:03] <Cork> use split if that is all you need
[03:13:11] <seutje> all the speeds!
[03:13:13] <krz> dont use?
[03:13:13] <intellilogic> :-/
[03:13:15] <krz> or use?
[03:13:23] <Cork> krz: use split if split can do the job
[03:13:28] <intellilogic> split is easier, sure.  regex is sexy.
[03:13:35] <seutje> sexy? really?
[03:13:36] <Cork> and split is much faster
[03:13:41] <intellilogic> ^
[03:13:48] <Cork> cause it doesn't need all the complex logic from regex
[03:14:09] <intellilogic> use split, I'm so used to things not having kind patterns
[03:14:12] <seutje> I'm adding that to the WAT
[03:14:43] <intellilogic> WAT?
[03:14:49] <Cork> XD
[03:14:58] <Cork> ?g javascript wat
[03:14:58] <b-ot> Cork: Wat — Destroy All Software Talks → https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
[03:15:37] <seutje> think wat plugin is disabled for this channel
[03:15:56] <seutje> b-ot: WAT?
[03:15:56] <b-ot> seutje: yes.
[03:16:04] <thehuntedpie> hey ppls
[03:16:05] <seutje> ugh, just PM it "WAT?"
[03:16:20] <Cork> :)
[03:16:33] <thehuntedpie> Are noobs welcome here?
[03:16:39] <Cork> heh ya
[03:16:44] <thehuntedpie> Or should I RTFM ? XD
[03:16:47] <intellilogic> Noobs and lower (me)
[03:16:53] <Cork> it's kinda the main point of the channel
[03:16:57] <seutje> errr
[03:17:12] <Cork> thehuntedpie: though you are expected to have learned the basics
[03:17:16] <thehuntedpie> ok kewl. I'm used to getting told to RTFM. But Im glad that culture is mostly changing :P
[03:17:19] <Cork> as in the very basics
[03:17:23] <seutje> Cork: aside from the occasional dicking around, that is!
[03:17:30] <thehuntedpie> I'm pretty ok at regular javascript
[03:17:33] <intellilogic> thehuntedpie:  I will answer all the basic questions as to boost my poor JS ego ;)
[03:17:45] <thehuntedpie> I just never really worked with jquery before
[03:17:56] <thehuntedpie> :D
[03:18:04] <thehuntedpie> intellilogic, good plan >:D
[03:18:19] <intellilogic> $(function(){ //stuff  });   boom, questions answered.
[03:18:24] <thehuntedpie> so i got this issue where I'm trying to make a pointer follow the mouse over a map
[03:18:42] <thehuntedpie> the pointer is in a higher z-layer
[03:18:59] <intellilogic> thehuntedpie:  What makes the pointer special, why not use CSS for moding the pointer?  (just a thought)
[03:19:06] <thehuntedpie> but when i move the mouse it only works when I move the mouse slowly
[03:19:17] <thehuntedpie> its a custom image
[03:19:28] <anli> I get ul.offset().left to 0 on an element that is visible, should that not be the position relative the document?
[03:19:29] <thehuntedpie> its for pin pointing a spot on the map
[03:19:31] <Cork> thehuntedpie: you can set custom image for css pointer
[03:19:39] <thehuntedpie> hmmm
[03:19:47] <Cork> anyway how are you changing the position of the element?
[03:19:49] <intellilogic> cursor:url(/img/magnify.cur), pointer;
[03:19:55] <intellilogic> <3
[03:20:07] <thehuntedpie> using offset
[03:20:09] <intellilogic> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/336925/custom-cursor-image-css
[03:20:13] <thehuntedpie> and position
[03:20:32] <anli> oh, it really was a hidden ul...
[03:20:37] <anli> I was using the wrong one
[03:20:44] <intellilogic> Ok, so keep going with question.  CSS is going to perform much better.
[03:21:09] <Cork> thehuntedpie: i mean are you grabbing the cursor position and take it from there or are you adding/subtrackting from the current position?
[03:21:22] <Cork> intellilogic: only if he can actually do it that way
[03:21:41] <Cork> as it was meant to be a pin cursor on a map i suspect it is meant to be dropped there too
[03:21:56] <thehuntedpie> I'm grabbing cursor position inside an element and using that offset to place the pointer div
[03:22:20] <Cork> thehuntedpie: where are you grabbing the mousemove event?
[03:22:23] <Cork> on document?
[03:22:25] <thehuntedpie> and yes, you can click to freeze it
[03:22:48] <thehuntedpie> it "drops" the target image
[03:22:50] <Cork> cause you might be getting the problem from moving into another element tree then the one you are watching
[03:22:56] <thehuntedpie> but its just a new div obviously
[03:23:36] <thehuntedpie> cork i dont know if thats the case. its kind of weird. when i move the mouse it works as long as my actual pointer is inside the pointer image div
[03:23:43] <thehuntedpie> but as soon as i move my mouse quickly it drops it
[03:23:49] <thehuntedpie> and wont pick it up again
[03:23:53] <thehuntedpie> till i slow down
[03:24:03] <Cork> thehuntedpie: sounds like you have bound the mousemove on the pointer
[03:24:10] <Cork> so ya, that would give that effect
[03:24:25] <Cork> *on the pin
[03:24:31] <thehuntedpie> oh wait nvm. its definitely tied to the pointer
[03:24:43] <thehuntedpie> cuz when i mouse over the pointer it picks it up again
[03:24:47] <thehuntedpie> i just dont know why
[03:24:49] <Cork> so bind it on a common parent instead
[03:24:52] <Cork> and it should just work
[03:24:52] <thehuntedpie> i did
[03:24:58] <thehuntedpie> i dont even know how it got to the pointer div
[03:25:02] <thehuntedpie> i bound by id
[03:25:12] <thehuntedpie> to the box
[03:25:19] <thehuntedpie> i even tried an invisible parent div
[03:25:20] <Cork> thehuntedpie: code please
[03:25:21] <thehuntedpie> to know avail
[03:25:30] <Cork> this guessing is getting out of hand
[03:25:56] <thehuntedpie> just a min
[03:27:03] <mls_> hi there
[03:30:33] <Kudos_> test
[03:31:13] <thehuntedpie> Cork, http://jsbin.com/AGAluDo/18/edit
[03:33:17] <thehuntedpie> Cork, are you able to access it?
[03:39:23] <thehuntedpie> the best idea i can come up with is that the inner div is hijacking the mouseover event somehow and stealing focus
[03:39:41] <thehuntedpie> though I dont really have experience with event handling
[03:43:00] <Cork> thehuntedpie: http://jsbin.com/imuHASI/1/edit
[03:43:37] <DarsVaeda> I have a form with multiple buttons, hitting enter should send the appropriate one, how do I select it?
[03:43:37] <DarsVaeda> http://codepaste.net/57weai
[03:43:51] <Cork> thehuntedpie: mouseout is only triggered when you move from one element to another
[03:43:59] <Cork> mousemove is what you want
[03:44:05] <thehuntedpie> aaah
[03:44:11] <DarsVaeda> I tried closest but I guess it does not work because it will only go up the tree?
[03:44:20] <thehuntedpie> that simple huh xD
[03:44:24] <thehuntedpie> Cork, thanks a ton man
[03:44:30] <Cork> DarsVaeda: user a form
[03:44:36] <Cork> thehuntedpie: np
[03:44:53] <thehuntedpie> Cork, btw can you tell me if you thought the rest of my code looks ok, or if I need serious work?
[03:44:56] <DarsVaeda> Cork, sorry?
[03:45:14] <thehuntedpie> just a brief estimation
[03:45:23] <Cork> DarsVaeda: when you hit enter submit will be triggered on the surrounding form
[03:45:51] <Cork> thehuntedpie: didn't look too bad from a skim
[03:46:00] <thehuntedpie> Cork,  thanks man
[03:46:07] <DarsVaeda> yes but I want to trigger a specific button then, is that possible?
[03:47:06] <thehuntedpie> I'm very new to jquery, so i know im going to be coding inefficiently till i get used to everything available to me
[03:47:07] <Cork> DarsVaeda: no, enter acts on the form
[03:47:14] <Cork> DarsVaeda: not the button
[03:47:22] <DarsVaeda> I mean if I do it manually
[03:47:27] <DarsVaeda> with keypress
[03:47:41] <Cork> well you could trigger a click on the button i guess
[03:47:56] <Cork> but you should really think over having another way then buttons to do that
[03:48:07] <Cork> ex. a dropdown or similar
[03:56:46] <DarsVaeda> hmm okay I'll rethink it
[04:11:53] <NCS_One> hi
[04:12:12] <NCS_One> offtopic: can someone help me give focus on a dinamically loaded tinymce 4 editor
[04:19:10] <RubyDavid> Hi all, I've created a plugin with lots of help from a plugin with simular functionallity but I've added a method and its getting called but not getting runed. what makes jquery just step over a method?
[04:20:30] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you set up a loop for a flash banner?
[04:21:17] <Cork> code_ph0y: a loop of what?
[04:21:28] <code_ph0y> I have 3 functions with tween functions ... all I have to do is call them in a loop
[04:21:50] <Cork> code_ph0y: are you talking about animations or?
[04:22:52] <code_ph0y> well I downloaded a tween plug in so I have coded 3 functions with tweens .... but I now have to call the functions
[04:23:06] <Cork> RubyDavid: code please
[04:23:20] <Cork> RubyDavid: jsfiddle.net please
[04:23:51] <code_ph0y> without crashing the browser
[04:24:17] <Cork> code_ph0y: well as js is single threaded, and a loop will block the browser from refreshing the page
[04:24:29] <Cork> you don't want a loop if you want to do animations
[04:24:45] <Cork> but as you arn't telling what you are trying to do i can't really say
[04:24:56] <code_ph0y> how would you do it then Cork
[04:25:05] <Cork> depends on what you are trying to do
[04:25:06] <RubyDavid> Code: http://jsfiddle.net/Zandman26/L8qBa/
[04:25:21] <code_ph0y> just a flash banner
[04:25:32] <Cork> RubyDavid: and what call isn't happening?
[04:26:50] <Cork> RubyDavid: why are you reinventing the event shim?
[04:26:57] <Cork> it is already in jquery
[04:27:34] <RubyDavid> this.onsubmit part, and its called in another js and when I use step into it goes from that file to this method but never in to it
[04:28:32] <Cork> RubyDavid: there is no onsubmit in that code
[04:29:05] <Cork> or are you talking about the commented out .submit at the top?
[04:29:27] <RubyDavid> no the onsubmit in the absolute bottom
[04:29:55] <Cork> uh...
[04:30:34] <Cork> ok..., so you're adding an onsubmit function to the jquery instance?
[04:30:50] <Cork> and when do you expect to call it?
[04:32:29] <RubyDavid> it is getting called within a form.submit fucntion
[04:32:56] <Cork> RubyDavid: and it is using the same jquery instance?
[04:33:23] <Cork> each $() creates a new instance, and that function will be lost if you call it on a new one
[04:36:06] <RubyDavid> what I know is that this plugin is only used on one element and its in the same RoR application
[04:37:55] <Cork> RubyDavid: $().function_that_adds_the_onsubmit_function(); $().onsubmit() won't work
[04:38:12] <Cork> you would have to create the function on $.fn for that to work
[04:43:18] <jop008> These are my coordinates 44.259815, 4.133771 how can I embed a google maps link on my site?
[04:43:19] <jop008>  
[04:43:34] <slax0r> read the guide on google?
[04:43:38] <jop008> I did
[04:43:45] <jop008> I couldnot fix it
[04:43:56] <RubyDavid> so this wont work? http://jsfiddle.net/Zandman26/XN6Vb/
[04:43:57] <slax0r> couldn't fix what exactly?
[04:48:18] <code_ph0y> can someone help me write my application function http://pastebin.com/wmshDYPn
[04:49:24] <Zimdale> What do you want it to do?
[04:50:42] <code_ph0y> call button1_click,button2_click,button3_click in a loop without crashing the browser
[04:51:16] <code_ph0y> basically its a flash banner am creating
[04:51:49] <Zimdale> Looks like you need to pull the count definition out of the function because it is redefining that count to 1 at the start of the function.
[04:52:16] <Zimdale> THen you probably need to a setTimeOut() at the end fo the function calling itself again so it runs more than once.
[04:53:31] <code_ph0y> ok let me try that then
[04:54:39] <code_ph0y> what will the setTimeout do?
[04:54:47] <code_ph0y> all application again
[04:54:57] <Zimdale> setTimeOut basically sets at imer
[04:55:17] <code_ph0y> call*
[04:55:30] <Zimdale> so it will allow you to set an time before running the function again
[04:55:41] <RubyDavid> Thx Cork setting it to $.fn worked much better:)
[04:56:11] <Zimdale> you would call application function
[05:00:12] <code_ph0y> thanks Zimdale I got it working :D
[05:03:37] <Zimdale> Awesome
[05:24:42] <Zimdale> So has anyone used paramquery?
[05:25:28] <Fraz> hi
[05:26:17] <Fraz> Id like to create a text selection like the one on android, where you drag around 2 handles to highlight the text you want....
[05:26:26] <Fraz> is that possible with jquery?
[05:27:02] <Zimdale> hmm....for like a textbox or in general?
[05:27:26] <Cork> Fraz: it is doable, but jquery doesn't have any helpers for it
[05:27:43] <Fraz> either a div or non-editable text box with some predefined text in it
[05:27:46] <Zimdale> Seems like it was be quite the pain in the ass to make though.
[05:27:53] <Cork> you would have to fiddle with the different selection apis in the browsers
[05:28:16] <Cork> and yes it isn't exactly easy to do
[05:28:36] <Fraz> hmm
[05:28:48] <Fraz> i wonder if a sortable could do it
[05:28:58] <Cork> the biggest problem is to know where on the screen a specific character is
[05:29:02] <Fraz> wrap each character in a span and make em sortable
[05:29:13] <Cork> O_o'
[05:29:18] <Zimdale> That sounds VERY VERY messy..
[05:29:21] <Cork> that would be overkill...
[05:29:40] <Cork> if you wrap each character in a dom element, then yes it would work quite easy
[05:29:52] <Cork> but it would be a PAIN to manager
[05:29:56] <Cork> *manage
[05:30:56] <Fraz> wrap each character in an li maybe and display inline
[05:31:11] <Cork> no need for them to be li's
[05:31:25] <Fraz> spans maybe?
[05:31:32] <Fraz> dunno if spans are sortable
[05:31:37] <seutje> fontbomb does that
[05:31:43] <Fraz> *can be sortable
[05:31:47] <seutje> lovely way to kill fps :P
[05:31:51] <Cork> sure, but remember that you would drastically increase the number of elements in the page
[05:31:59] <Cork> and that would slow things down
[05:32:02] <Cork> ya
[05:32:07] <Fraz> hm
[05:32:30] <Fraz> yeh and t he text can be any length so would be a problem with large ammounts of content
[05:32:38] <Zimdale> why does fontbomb exist? lol
[05:32:41] <seutje> Fraz: try it for urself: http://fontbomb.ilex.ca/
[05:32:50] <seutje> click a couple times on the paragraphs
[05:33:22] <seutje> tbh, it's prolly the animation of 435676543 DOM elements at once that kills the FPS, not the elements themselves
[05:35:16] <Fraz> lol
[05:35:23] <Fraz> dunno how that font bomb thing would be useful
[05:37:44] <sandstrom> How would one unbind (`off`) an event handler that is bound using `.bind` (ecma)?
[05:37:57] <sandstrom> (without storing the intermediary, bound, function)
[05:38:09] <Cork> sandstrom: .unbind()
[05:38:11] <Fraz> hmm, since the selection will have a maximum character length, i could limit the sortables
[05:38:18] <Cork> sandstrom: use namescopes
[05:38:30] <sandstrom> Cork: can't
[05:38:46] <Cork> sandstrom: .on('click.my-special-events').on('change.my-special-events').on('select.my-special-events')
[05:38:47] <sandstrom> var f = function() {}; f !== f.bind('foo')
[05:38:55] <Cork> off('.my-special-events')
[05:39:01] <Fraz> onclick of the left handle, make the previous n characters sortable
[05:39:14] <Cork> ah, you mean that bind
[05:39:19] <Fraz> and for the right handle, the next n characters
[05:39:25] <Cork> sandstrom: i don't think you can
[05:39:27] <sandstrom> Cork: it's a good and clever solution, but I can't use it for this event ('orientationchange')
[05:39:31] <Fraz> if the selection is < max length
[05:39:44] <Cork> sandstrom: ya, i missed that you wheren't talking about jquery bind
[05:39:53] <seutje> Fraz: it was just an example of how having a ton of DOM elements is generally a bad idea
[05:40:05] <Fraz> ahh right
[05:40:08] <sandstrom> Cork: I'll try to save a reference to the bound function then, just wanted to check if there was a way. thanks!
[05:40:24] <seutje> if this was implemented with a canvas, it would probably be smooth as poo
[05:40:46] <Cork> sandstrom: there isn't as far as i know
[05:40:57] <thehuntedpie> how do i include the widget factory into my code? or is there a better library for tooltips?
[05:41:31] <Cork> thehuntedpie: you don't need to include the widget factory, it is a framework for creating a widget
[05:42:20] <thehuntedpie> so i just have to invlude jquery-ui?
[05:42:25] <thehuntedpie> include*
[05:42:41] <Cork> yes
[05:43:04] <thehuntedpie> k I'll try now

[05:49:10] <usc911> hey guys, I have an input field that you can submit a number of words that are then displayed on the next page, I was just wondering if there was an easy way to not allow you to submit if the field is empty?
[05:51:19] <seutje> usc911:
[05:51:26] <seutje> usc911: required attribute
[05:53:19] <usc911> seutje: so I just need to set an attribute of required?
[05:54:45] <usc911> seutje: ah got it, thanks!
[05:58:42] <thehuntedpie> I seem to have trouble invoking the tooltip
[05:59:18] <seutje> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/uMVms/1/
[05:59:53] <seutje> could prolly be made more efficient though
[06:00:21] <seutje> oh wait, u want the ones already in the list to be randomized as well?
[06:00:38] <frank_o> seutje: Cool, but like
[06:01:10] <frank_o> I'd like the two lists to shuffle if that makes any sense, while not randomizing each list's order
[06:01:24] <thehuntedpie> is it possible to manually assign a label to an elements tooltip
[06:01:28] <seutje> frank_o: there http://jsfiddle.net/uMVms/2/
[06:01:37] <thehuntedpie> i mean do i have to use the title attribute
[06:01:41] <seutje> frank_o: sry, what was that last?
[06:01:52] <seutje> u wanna shuffle without changing order? o.O

[06:03:05] <seutje> frank_o: I don't understand what u want then
[06:03:11] <seutje> random, but not random?
[06:03:57] <thehuntedpie> I did this: $(markerID).tooltip({content: label });
[06:04:05] <thehuntedpie> but it doesnt seem to be working
[06:04:50] <seutje> thehuntedpie: this is the part where I guess you're using a tooltip plugin?
[06:05:02] <thehuntedpie> yes
[06:05:19] <thehuntedpie> i was told it comes with jquery ui
[06:05:23] <seutje> is this also the part where I guess exactly which of the 45768765436 tooltip plugins?
[06:05:24] <frank_o> seutje: Yep, like 1, 2, a, 3, b, c, 4, d, 5 -- the letters and numbers are stacked randomly but their individual order is preserved
[06:05:27] <thehuntedpie> part of widgets
[06:05:29] <seutje> aha
[06:05:34] * frank_o ponders a better way to explain
[06:05:56] <thehuntedpie> i dont need anything fancy really
[06:06:07] <seutje> thehuntedpie: you can use a function as the content handler: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content
[06:06:37] <seutje> so just go like content: function () { return $(this).attr('label'); }
[06:07:09] <seutje> u can put all sorts of fancy checks and fallbacks in there, as the example illustrates
[06:07:18] <seutje> frank_o: oh
[06:07:27] <seutje> frank_o: so u wanna merge 2 lists at random points
[06:07:46] <frank_o> seutje: Yeah that's a nice way to put it
[06:07:57] <frank_o> seutje: By the way as for basic randomization wouldn't http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zsn6j/ be easier?
[06:08:19] <seutje> shouldn't use sort for random
[06:08:32] <seutje> ur essentially telling it "A comes before B"
[06:08:42] <seutje> and then a little later u might be telling it "B comes before A"
[06:08:52] <seutje> and then you expect JS to make sense of ur mumbling :P

[06:10:58] <frank_o> hehe
[06:11:43] <seutje> thehuntedpie: erm wtf, ur telling me " content: label " doesn't work, I tell you to pass a function to content and show you an example of using jquery UI tooltip with content callback and now I'm telling you to write ur own plugin? o>O
[06:12:07] <seutje> I even gave you the exact function to replace label with
[06:12:28] <thehuntedpie> sorry man, I'm really new to jquery I just started today
[06:12:32] <seutje> you could just go var label = function() { return $(this).attr('label'); } and be done with it
[06:12:42] <seutje> then u can still use ur label variable :D
[06:13:27] <inad922> hello
[06:13:50] <inad922> How do I emulate a click on an <a>/link tag with jquery
[06:14:06] <inad922> I just want to do something before making the get call to the server
[06:15:44] <Fraz> is it possible to have a sortable list like <ul><li id="handle1"></li><li>a</li><li>b</li><li>c</li><li>d</li><li>e</li><li>f</li><li>g</li><li id="handle2"></li></ul> where all li elements are sortable but only the elements with id handle1 and handle2 can be moved around?
[06:16:14] <Cork> inad922: $('a').click(); though this WON'T emulate the default action (loading the page the link points to)
[06:16:33] <Cork> inad922: this is not cause of jquery, but that browsers won't let scripts fake clicks on links
[06:17:09] <Cork> inad922: so if you want to change the current page do window.location = $('a').prop('href');
[06:18:05] <inad922> Cork: I don't actually want to emulate a click. I just want to load a page with a get call. Is there a better way to do this?
[06:18:20] <Cork> inad922: i just told you
[06:19:41] <seutje> lol
[06:19:44] <seutje> these guys...
[06:21:06] <inad922> so I just set the window.location to something programatically and that triggers a page load? How does this make a difference between a GET and a POST call and how do I set the payload?
[06:21:20] <inad922> doesn't make too much sense to me
[06:21:26] <Cork> inad922: you can't do a get call this way
[06:21:27] <inad922> maybe I'm missing something
[06:21:40] <Cork> inad922: if you want to load a page through a post you need to create a form
[06:21:47] <inad922> ah
[06:21:49] <inad922> ok
[06:22:26] <inad922> is it really an ugly solution if I just set the window.location for a post call or should I just wrap it in a form?
[06:23:02] <Cork> inad922: no if you want to do a post
[06:23:14] <Cork> you would have to actually create a form element
[06:23:17] <Cork> add the input fields
[06:23:22] <Cork> and so a submit() on them
[06:23:54] <inad922> ok, it makes sense
[06:24:03] <inad922> Thanks Cork
[06:24:18] <Cork> as in $('<form target="http://www.example.com/"><input type="hidden" name="a" value="a"></form>').appendTo('body').submit()
[06:25:23] <thehuntedpie> seutje, soryr man but Im still confused as to how I'm supposed to make tooltips work
[06:25:35] <thehuntedpie> i just spent the past 10 minutes reading
[06:25:49] <thehuntedpie> and I still dont know what im doing wrong
[06:26:03] <seutje> thehuntedpie: $(markerID).tooltip({content: function(){ return $(this).attr('label'); } });
[06:26:31] <mls_> hi all
[06:27:55] <mls_> [JQ + validate] I would like to get the same thing as "required : true" in rules, but using "required : {depends:function(element){return();}}
[06:28:01] <thehuntedpie> seutje, why would that work if $(markerID).tooltip({content: label}); is not working?
[06:28:25] <thehuntedpie> where label is a variable with tooltip text
[06:28:41] <mls_> I mean what should I return to test if my field (a file input) is already valid
[06:29:39] <Cork> thehuntedpie: the tooltip by default uses the title attribute of the element
[06:30:13] <thehuntedpie> Cork, so whats the point of defining content?
[06:30:37] <Cork> thehuntedpie: if you give it a string it will always use that string; if you give it a function it will call it for each element
[06:31:08] <thehuntedpie> in my case i havent defined the title attribute of the selector, yet i have defined the content
[06:31:14] <thehuntedpie> so i dont understnad why its not working
[06:31:29] <Cork> thehuntedpie: what are you passing to the content?
[06:31:36] <thehuntedpie> a variable holding a string
[06:31:47] <Cork> well that should work
[06:31:50] <thehuntedpie> yeh
[06:31:54] <thehuntedpie> thats why im so confused
[06:33:18] <inad922> Cork: Eh I missed the last part. That's a neat way to append a form.
[06:35:04] <seutje> thehuntedpie: oh, that's odd o.O
[06:35:08] <seutje> no errors or nothing>
[06:35:09] <seutje> ?
[06:36:24] <thehuntedpie> im trying to trouble shoot
[06:36:31] <thehuntedpie> im using z-layers
[06:36:35] <thehuntedpie> maybe thats why
[06:36:43] <Sal> heu guys, i'm getting confution... i need to send and get back data from php. i saw that jquery has a lot of methods to do this: ajax, get, post, load, etc, which one should i use?
[06:36:46] <Sal> whats the best one?
[06:37:00] <Sal> confusion
[06:37:02] <Sal> sorry
[06:38:12] <Sal> all i need to do is send page number and some query parameters to php and read back the query result so that i can populate a table
[06:38:27] <Cork> oh right!
[06:38:31] <Cork> you need to fix the selector
[06:39:42] <Cork> seutje, thehuntedpie: tooltip({ content: label, item: 'a' })
[06:39:54] <Cork> replace 'a' with a selector that should match the target elements
[06:40:05] <Cork> the default one is '[title]'
[06:43:35] <thehuntedpie> cork Can i assign a tooltip on a per element basis or do I need to choose a general selector
[06:43:45] <Cork> thehuntedpie: http://jsbin.com/ewUlaRe/1/edit
[06:44:00] <Cork> thehuntedpie: if you want per element you should use the callback function
[06:44:10] <thehuntedpie> whats that?
[06:44:12] <Cork> as in content: function() {}
[06:44:25] <seutje> Cork: oh lol
[06:44:47] <Cork> seutje: i've actually seen that problem before, just forgot...
[06:44:57] <seutje> I assumed the rpoblem was getting it different for each element
[06:45:13] <seutje> and this is why I use CSS for my tooltips :P
[06:45:36] <Cork> well it isn't the reason, but i use css too ya
[06:45:57] <thehuntedpie> Corey, freaking sweet, that wildcard selector did it for me
[06:46:02] <thehuntedpie> Cork, *
[06:46:30] <Cork> thehuntedpie: you could change it to any selector you want if you want to restrict it more
[06:47:26] <thehuntedpie> Cork, i just plan on churning out some landmarks with generated sequential IDs all i care is that they show coordinates when i hover over them
[06:50:03] <mls_> [JQ + validate] I would like to get the same thing as "required : true" in rules, but using "required : {depends:function(element){return();}}
[06:50:07] <mls_> I mean what should I return to test if my field (a file input) is already valid
[06:50:55] <thehuntedpie> Corey,  seutje thanks guys
[06:52:44] <Justin_ZW> So I've got this code here: http://pastebin.com/cqG8jTUC and I want to know why it doesn't work. It's part of a wordpress plugin, but I just did some quickly thrown together small thing to test it. Upon clicking remove source, it's supposed to remove the last <p> and everything inside it, but it doesn't.
[06:53:04] <Justin_ZW> I'm not particularly familiar with jQuery.
[06:53:12] <Justin_ZW> So I figured this would be the place to ask.
[06:53:37] <Justin_ZW> I should also add that I'm picking up someone else's project because they abandoned it.
[06:55:05] <seutje> Justin_ZW: <p> is never the last child in the container
[06:55:21] <seutje> the remove button is
[06:56:16] <seutje> also, ur not calling remove
[06:56:37] <seutje> Justin_ZW: try this http://pastebin.com/uP3VGZDq
[06:58:35] <Justin_ZW> That works. But now to understand why.
[06:59:53] <Justin_ZW> If I've got this right, the .eq(-1) tells it to use the last matched "p" element.
[06:59:57] <Justin_ZW> Right?
[07:00:36] <bberry> has anyone used jsTree?
[07:01:06] <bberry> im trying to do ajax json loading with it and am struggling pretty bad
[07:01:13] <weeb1e> Hi everyone
[07:02:05] <weeb1e> Does anyone know if it is possible to detect if an element contains other elements or just plain text? I would like to recursively walk through all child elements and only process and modify the text inside elements which do not contain other elements
[07:03:12] <seutje> weeb1e: check nodeName
[07:09:03] <roxlu> hi! I've got a string like: { "type": "1", "title" : "some title"}, which I want to parse as json, but I think I need to add slashes for the quotes... is there a function that will cleanup my string so I can parse it as a json string?
[07:09:32] <Cork> roxlu: if you already have that in a string it should just work
[07:09:59] <Cork> js> print(JSON.parse('{ "type": "1", "title" : "some title"}').type)
[07:10:04] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[07:10:21] <Cork> js> print(JSON.parse('{ "type": "1", "title" : "some title"}').title)
[07:10:26] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[07:10:29] <Cork> ...
[07:10:44] <roxlu> Cork: when I parse the string as you show it works, but I'm receiving that string over a websocket
[07:11:12] <Cork> roxlu: doens't matter
[07:11:34] <Cork> roxlu: only situation when you need to escape it is if the js parser will walk it
[07:11:35] <roxlu> and when I use the data member that I receive in my onmessage, it gives an error "SyntaxError: Unexpected Token"
[07:11:42] <Cork> as if you define it inline in js
[07:12:00] <Cork> sounds like the json is invalid then
[07:12:55] <Cork> onmessage = function(message) { console.log(JSON.parse(message).title) }; should work just fine
[07:13:25] <roxlu> you mean message.data I think
[07:14:11] <Cork> ah, ya
[07:14:28] <Cork> was a little while since i fiddle with websocket last
[07:14:33] <roxlu> Cork: https://gist.github.com/roxlu/961e38dcb82c4504e70d that's what I'm doing
[07:14:52] <roxlu> line 6 works w/o errors, but line 9 not
[07:14:57] <mls_> anyone know how to know which rules is false in a jquery validate ? I have my $(#myForm").valid() which returns false, but I would like to know which rule is false
[07:14:58] <frank_o_1> Say. How do I insert #coupon into #shopping_list randomly while preserving the original order? Say you have "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" and "a, b, c, d", the result would be "1, 2, a, 3, b, c, 4, d, 5". Almost there, having some trouble with the implementation: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zsn6j/9/
[07:15:09] <roxlu> though I simply copy pasted the string I got from console.log(m.data)
[07:15:21] <Cork> roxlu: take the json you get and feed it through jsonlint
[07:15:26] <Cork> ?g jsonlint
[07:15:26] <b-ot> Cork: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. → http://jsonlint.com/
[07:15:34] <roxlu> Cork: I did and it says it's valid
[07:16:03] <Cork> roxlu: well it can't be cause then you wouldn't get the error
[07:16:37] <roxlu> oh I used another validator ..
[07:16:42] <roxlu> jslint fails indeed
[07:16:50] <Cork> this.ws.onmessage = function(event) { process(JSON.parse(event.data)); } <-- this is a straight copy from my code
[07:17:00] <Cork> and it works just fine
[07:17:39] <roxlu> ha, it was a space at the end of the json :$
[07:18:50] <MrMaffen> Hi guys. I'm currently working on a web app that allows the user to download several images from different servers all at once. I'm working with javascript and only on the client's side. My problem is that I'm running into problems with the same-origin-policy with my $.ajax calls on several servers (for example XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.agroatlas.ru/content/weeds/Sinapis_arvensis/Sinapis_arvensis.jpg. Origin null is not allowed by
[07:18:50] <MrMaffen> Access-Control-Allow-Origin. )
[07:18:57] <MrMaffen> How can I work around this?
[07:19:14] <MrMaffen> I don't have access to the server that is hosting the image file
[07:19:40] <MrMaffen> This is my $ajax call:
[07:19:40] <MrMaffen> $.ajax({
[07:19:40] <MrMaffen>         url: url,
[07:19:40] <MrMaffen>         mimeType: 'text/plain; charset=x-user-defined',
[07:19:40] <MrMaffen>         timeout: 10000,
[07:19:41] <MrMaffen>         crossDomain: true
[07:19:43] <MrMaffen>       })
[07:19:52] <Cork> MrMaffen: don't dump code in the channel!
[07:19:54] <MrMaffen> crossDomain: true doesn't make any differenc though
[07:20:42] <MrMaffen> Cork: Just a few lines, so I though I dump it here directly instead of using a paste-site.
[07:20:47] <MrMaffen> thought*
[07:21:02] <Cork> MrMaffen: well if it is more then two lines use a pb
[07:21:24] <roxlu> Cork: I removed the space, it validates with jslint, but chrome fails to parse it .. same error
[07:21:25] <MrMaffen> Cork: okidoki
[07:21:27] <roxlu> maybe encoding?
[07:21:43] <Cork> roxlu: possibly, it is expected to be utf8
[07:21:47] <Justin_ZW> Anyways... I have one last question before I leave. I remember awhile ago that jQuery used $ as its variable. Now, I can't get anything to work with $ but jQuery does.
[07:22:00] <Justin_ZW> Is there a difference between $() and jQuery()?
[07:22:18] <Cork> Justin_ZW: you most likely are using a separate framework that overwrites $ for you
[07:22:29] <Justin_ZW> Ah.
[07:22:33] <Cork> Justin_ZW: and no jQuery and $ is the same normally
[07:23:03] <Cork> if you want you can do jQuery(function($) {}); and $ will be jQuery in there
[07:23:54] <vpiskunov> guys can anyone invite me to #php please
[07:24:52] <Cork> vpiskunov: register your nick and use ##php and it will just work
[07:25:04] <Cork> (## instead of # that is)
[07:31:52] <MrMaffen> Any ideas ? :/
[07:32:12] <MrMaffen> I've been searching for hours now and didn't come up with a proper workaround/solution
[07:33:54] <joroci> for?
[07:34:29] <joroci> MrMaffen: for?
[07:34:30] <vpiskunov> Cork: cheers
[07:34:46] <bberry> Has anyone used jsTree for anything? I'm having a hard time understand the ajax loading for it.
[07:37:01] <MrMaffen> joroci: qry to avoid spamming ^^
[07:44:27] <seutje> MrMaffen: why ajax? just make an image element and grab the data onload?
[07:44:46] <seutje> also, I doubt the server serves the images as plain text
[08:12:22] <MrMaffen> seutje: that sounds way better actually ^^
[08:12:39] <MrMaffen> seutje: the mimetype is being used to download the binary image data without processing
[08:12:41] <nicetry> Hey guys - is there a 'best' way to deal with e.preventDefault() not working in IE?
[08:14:16] <Cork> nicetry: preventDefault should normally work
[08:14:44] <Cork> actually i haven't experienced it not working in newer versions (post ie6 at least)
[08:15:05] <Jonasdb> anyone know how to change a page? $.mobile.changePage is deprecated but i don't find an alternative #jqm
[08:15:50] <Tim___> Hello, I'm using the  jQuery Dialog. I have it working as a pop up when you click on something like read more. But It doesn't seem to work with Internet Explorer do you know of any fixes for it?
[08:16:31] <Cork> Tim___: are you using jquery 2.0 or something?
[08:16:39] <Cork> dialog should work just fine in ie
[08:17:43] <Tim___> Cork im using 1.6.2
[08:17:46] <itunios> http://www.theweeklypay.com/index.php?share=19844/
[08:17:58] <Cork> Tim___: then the problem is somewhere else
[08:18:06] <Cork> dialog works just fine with ie
[08:20:16] <Tim___> Cork: hmm, is there a link where I can show you the code?
[08:20:41] <Cork> Tim___: you could try reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net
[08:26:14] <Tim___> Cork: here is what I have, It also doesnt work in JSFiddle it works in FireFox and Chrome. http://jsfiddle.net/YgqbH/
[08:27:12] <nicetry> Cork: Hmmmm maybe I'm using an out of date version
[08:27:28] <nicetry> could that have been fixed between 1.10.1 and 1.10.2?
[08:29:03] <Cork> Tim___: http://jsfiddle.net/YgqbH/1/ works just fine here
[08:29:43] <Cork> nicetry: no, haven't heard about any preventDefault bugs in jquery more or less ever
[08:30:20] <Cork> Tim___: tested in ie9 though, it is the only one i have available here at the moment
[08:33:00] <Tim___> Cork hmm i have ie10 and it doesnt want to work
[08:33:40] <Cork> Tim___: on this one too? http://jsfiddle.net/YgqbH/1/
[08:34:17] <Forbidd3n> How to remove the last two elements of a div? I tried $('.divClass').find('div').last().remove();
[08:34:23] <Forbidd3n> twice and it only remove the first one
[08:34:45] <Tim___> Cork: It works with that. What did you change to make it work?
[08:35:02] <Cork> Tim___: i added jquery and jquery ui on the left side
[08:35:36] <Cork> Tim___: meaning i changed nothing in the markup or js
[08:37:40] <Tim___> Cork: ok, so i have no clue whats wrong. It doesnt work in my html file http://pastebin.com/8Gr3Ng4M
[08:38:12] <thehuntedpie> Cork, When I use the image as mouse pointer, i am unable to trigger the tooltips
[08:38:26] <thehuntedpie> do you know of any workarounds or must i resort to css?
[08:38:49] <Cork> image as mouse pointer?
[08:38:56] <Cork> you mean the mousemove thing?
[08:39:25] <thehuntedpie> yeh the cursor
[08:39:31] <thehuntedpie> i've replaced my cursor with an image
[08:39:39] <thehuntedpie> and set cursor:none
[08:39:57] <Cork> uh
[08:40:30] <Cork> have you placed the cursor with an image, or have you hid the cursor and moves a dom element along with the cursor?
[08:40:47] <Cork> if it is the later that would explain it, as you would always hover that image
[08:40:55] <Cork> so no other element would get the hover event
[08:41:26] <thehuntedpie> ye it is and thats what im thinking too but i dont know of any other way
[08:41:40] <Cork> thehuntedpie: there is a pointer-event css rule you could use
[08:41:53] <thehuntedpie> ok ill google that
[08:41:55] <Cork> though it has limitations to what browsers it works in
[08:42:00] <Cork> ?mdn pointer-event
[08:42:01] <b-ot> Cork: pointer-events - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[08:42:22] <Cork> though notice the compatibility list at the bottom
[08:42:29] <Cork> expecially the ie9 part :)
[08:42:31] <thehuntedpie> ah i think i know about custom cursors for IE and Mozilla both of which are 2 seperate implementations
[08:42:45] <thehuntedpie> i was trying to make something universally compatible
[08:42:47] <Cork> what?
[08:42:50] <thehuntedpie> hmm
[08:43:07] <Cork> thehuntedpie: if you just want to have a custom cursor just set cursor: url(image);
[08:43:26] <Cork> if you want to do something more creative you might need to use the element thingy
[08:43:27] <thehuntedpie> but will that apply across all modern browsers?
[08:43:36] <Cork> and all none modern too
[08:43:45] <Cork> i would guess at support pre ie4
[08:44:03] <Cork> the cursor option is really old
[08:46:04] <thehuntedpie> yeh i just seemed to remember hearing about it having issues with compatiblity
[08:46:18] <thehuntedpie> so i always avoided it
[08:46:27] <Tim___> Cork: Does this work for you? http://pastebin.com/8Gr3Ng4M
[08:47:16] <jop008> How can I get Choose type as top of this selectbox ? http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/46/
[08:47:43] <jop008> Now the select is missing the description of it's meaning
[08:48:09] <Cork> Forbidd3n: opps missed to answer you slice(-2).remove()
[08:48:44] <Cork> Tim___: please don't use pb, the code can't be run from there
[08:49:51] <Tim___> Cork: yes I know, that is the exact same code I have added in JSFiddle and it doesnt work.
[08:50:18] <Cork> Tim___: check so you load the resources you need
[08:52:36] <Tim___> Cork: yeah doesnt that and still no luck
[08:54:00] <Cork> Tim___: this is an exact copy of your pb http://jsbin.com/EFOQIgE/1
[08:54:03] <Cork> and it works just fine
[08:54:10] <Cork> so the problem is something else
[08:54:24] <Cork> check so your ie isn't broken or something
[08:54:42] <jop008> : How can I get Choose type as top of this selectbox ? http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/46/
[08:54:55] <Tim___> Cork: yeah I'm going to reinstall it
[08:55:23] <Cork> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/47/ ?
[09:04:18] <jop008> Cork it keeps spinning
[09:04:25] <jop008> the fiddle
[09:04:34] <Cork> hit the run button
[09:05:00] <Cork> i got the same problem with your link too
[09:05:37] <jop008> and what was the change?
[09:05:52] <Cork> selected in the html
[09:06:12] <jop008> okay thx
[09:06:17] <Cork> np
[09:08:52] <jop008> So that's the only way make it selected? (I had it like that :-)
[09:09:03] <lenswipe> hey guys
[09:09:13] <lenswipe> can someone tell me the correct order for arguments of .on
[09:09:36] <lenswipe> is it $.on('parent', 'child', function(){}); or is it $.on('child', 'parent', function(){}); ?
[09:10:11] <slax0r> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+on
[09:10:12] <dcherman> lenswipe: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:10:49] <lenswipe> yes I've read that
[09:11:02] <lenswipe> it says ".on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler(eventObject) )"
[09:11:10] <lenswipe> that doesn't really answer my question
[09:11:10] <Erneston> helllo ?
[09:11:25] <slax0r> how does that not answer your question?
[09:11:33] <Erneston> anyone else able to post in #html ?
[09:11:49] <lenswipe> slax0r, because Im using two selectors not three
[09:11:53] <lenswipe> a parent and a child
[09:11:58] <lenswipe> i want to know what way around they go
[09:12:01] <lenswipe> that doesn't specify
[09:12:09] <Erneston> i am unable to get the clearTimeout working, can anyone advise? http://jsfiddle.net/RTADa/55/
[09:12:36] <Erneston> clicking the 'stop' button is expected to stop the dialog appearing
[09:13:06] <slax0r> well .on('child', 'parent', function(){}) basically listens for a 'child' event on an element found with 'parent' selector
[09:14:16] <slax0r> Erneston: works for me
[09:15:05] <Erneston> if you click stop the dialog does not fade in ?
[09:15:33] <lenswipe> slacko, thank you, much apreaciated
[09:15:47] <lenswipe> slax0r, ".on('child', 'parent', function(){})" is the info i was looking for :)
[09:16:43] <slax0r> oh, yeah, it does :/
[09:18:55] <lenswipe> slax0r, just to check is $('#parent').on('click', '#child', function(e){}); valid?
[09:19:23] <slax0r> Erneston: fixed it for ya: http://jsfiddle.net/RTADa/55/
[09:19:28] <slax0r> errr
[09:19:39] <slax0r> http://jsfiddle.net/RTADa/56/
[09:19:51] <slax0r> lenswipe:  probbaly, tias
[09:19:58] <lenswipe> ok
[09:21:05] <bberry> is anyone familiar with jsTree? I am trying to use it and running into a brick wall.
[09:21:09] <slax0r> Erneston: your problem was that in your function declaration you had a var with the same name as your public was, and was assigning the timeout ID to that function variable, not the global one, and thus you couldn't stop the timer
[09:22:43] <Erneston> am back
[09:23:59] <Erneston> it was a case of removing: timed_delay from the function param?
[09:24:30] <Erneston> i still dont understand functions :( i need to go back and learn them
[09:24:42] <Erneston> thx
[09:25:09] <Erneston> am blind, even the examples i was reading did not have this var
[09:25:12] <Erneston> :(
[09:25:34] <Forbidd3n> I have a button that is added to the dom after page is loaded. I have this for the click event on the button which holds addRow class -- $('body').on('click', '.addRow', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); console.log('button clicked'); }); -- but when button is clicked it submits the form instead of the console printout.
[09:25:44] <Erneston> does anyone remember the old 'i have a small penis' prank ?
[09:25:52] <Forbidd3n> my button is <button class="addRow">Add Row</button>
[09:25:59] <Erneston> it was a program
[09:26:04] <lenswipe> Erneston, ...
[09:26:24] <Erneston> basically you ran the program and it presented you with a message:
[09:26:46] <lenswipe> ...
[09:26:50] <Erneston> "do you have a small penis?"  - no was not clickable as it would move around the page
[09:26:56] <lenswipe> lol
[09:26:58] <jop008> Can you change a single seelct to a multiple select on the fly?
[09:27:04] <Erneston> so in order to exit the user was forced to click yes
[09:27:08] <slax0r> Forbidd3n: you need to bind form .submit and prevent it
[09:27:18] <Erneston> no one remembers this ?
[09:27:24] <Erneston> anyone from 90's will
[09:28:00] <Erneston> am trying to achieve a similiar effect, of making an element move away from mouse position
[09:28:17] <slax0r> Erneston: slow down, learn basics of programming first
[09:28:29] <slax0r> if you're having trouble understanding how 'functions work'
[09:28:49] <Erneston> custom functions mostly
[09:29:31] <Erneston> am learning with test cases, keep making little testers to use specific functions
[09:30:27] <Erneston> am making a gimmick website, interactive piece
[09:30:37] <Erneston> please dont ask why, thats just what is required
[09:30:59] <Erneston> already had an arguement about how content is key
[09:31:19] <Erneston> we are approaching this backwards :(
[09:33:52] <nardev> hello, i use hidden div as storage for some content, but it seems that i can't select the value/text/html in that div if it is hidden, do you have any suggestion how to overcome this issue?
[09:34:51] <nardev> ??
[09:37:05] <chilversc_> when using ajax and serializing an object with nested parameters to key/value pairs, is there a setting to use a dotted notation
[09:37:17] <chilversc_> eg, instead of; foo[bar]=5, foo.bar=5
[09:38:55] <slax0r> nardev: shouldn't be a problem
[09:39:13] <slax0r> are you sure the data is there, the div is present, and you have the right selector?
[09:39:25] <nardev> slax0r, ah. just checked in jsfiddle.. it works but inside this script.. no.. :(
[09:39:40] <slax0r> nardev: how do you write out this div?
[09:39:44] <nardev> actually it's not a div it's custom tag..
[09:39:51] <nardev> <feedback>...
[09:39:57] <nardev> but it should work anyway...
[09:40:23] <slax0r> did you check your error console in your browser?
[09:40:25] <sanjayb> chilversc, if "bar" is a variable name, you of course can't do foo.bar since JS would not know to interpret that as foo[bar] or foo['bar'] .. when you use dotted notation, the JS interpreter looks for a property called 'bar' on the object foo. It cannot guess that 'bar' is actually a variable holding another value and to look that up. Therefore you have to use foo[bar] if bar is a variable name.
[09:40:45] <nardev> slax0r, maybe it's because i use nextInDOM
[09:40:45] <nardev> plugin
[09:40:45] <nardev> ... it can't get it.. maybe...
[09:41:09] <nardev> slax0r, it's open...
[09:41:51] <slax0r> yeah...have fun with that, I really have to run, bai
[09:44:07] <computer2000> anyone can help me with this: i want to check if an element is within range (css left) of any of some other elements. can i use underscore for this? like to ask: is this element within any of these other elements? or is there any other way?
[09:44:30] <sanjayb> nardev: paste code if you like, i can take a look .. have you checked using Inspect Element or so if the hidden element exists in the DOM ?
[09:45:26] <sanjayb> computer2000: what do you mean "within", do you mean within as in "is a child element of", or do you mean "is visually within", i.e. could have been placed there via css, but not structurally "within" in the DOM?
[09:45:37] <nardev> sanjayb, it's huge.. anyway CAN IT BE that jquery can't select elements which have dynamically assigned ids?
[09:45:38] <computer2000> sanjayb: visually within
[09:46:10] <sanjayb> computer2000: interesting :) - have you looked for plugins to handle this? I'm definitely sure there isn't a way to do it in jquery core, or without writing a bit of code ..
[09:47:18] <sanjayb> nardev: what do you mean "dynamically assigned ids"? you mean they get their ids assigned after page has loaded? Should not be a problem, as long as the ids are unique. In your JS console, can you do $('#<object_id>') .. do you get a DOM object returned or an empty array?
[09:48:55] <nardev> sanjayb, yes, assigned after the page was loaded and they are unique.. yes, i know how to check it but again it doesn't behave normally...
[09:49:11] <nardev> sanjayb, i'll try to replicate it in jsfiddle
[09:49:30] <sanjayb> nardev: define "doesn't behave normally" :)
[09:49:34] <sanjayb> nardev: cool.
[09:50:21] <sanjayb> computer2000: in theory you could look up top, left, width and height of all elements on the page, and check what is within what, but that seems like a> a lot of code and b> horribly inefficient ..
[09:50:49] <computer2000> sanjayb: thats why im asking if its possible with some underscore function, but i guess tahts a bit offtopic
[09:50:55] <Erneston> i have managed to change the cursor with css, how could i make it so that when you try to move a modal dialog the 'move' cursor does not replace your specified cursor
[09:51:15] <sanjayb> computer2000: underscore has nothing to do with this / will not help you with this.
[09:52:45] <sanjayb> computer2000: this is essentially a problem of getting position values of DOM elements, which jQuery makes it easy to do .. it just sounds very inefficient and i'd probably try and think about the use-case a bit better / see if you can do this another way .
[09:53:41] <sanjayb> computer2000, can you at least reduce the set of elements you're checking, i.e. only checking if elements of class foo are inside element with class bar .. and not just "find me any element in the DOM that this element is within" ?
[09:53:52] <computer2000> sanjayb: sure
[09:54:18] <Erneston> solved
[09:54:25] <Erneston> no jquery required :p
[09:54:59] <chilversc_> sanjayb: the original object would be; { foo: { bar: 5 } }
[09:55:39] <sanjayb> chilversc: so, foo.bar should work ?
[09:56:22] <chilversc_> this is serializing to x-www-formurlencoded, jQuery is using the format foo[bar]=5, and I need foo.bar=5
[09:56:57] <sanjayb> chilversc: do you mean foo[bar] or foo['bar'] ?
[09:57:15] <sacho> chilversc_, what kind of serialization format is that?
[09:57:35] <sanjayb> chilversc, but ah, this is serializing to send to your back-end, sorry, i think i misunderstood that a bit.
[09:59:15] <sanjayb> computer2000: take a look at http://api.jquery.com/position/ , http://api.jquery.com/width/ and http://api.jquery.com/height/ .. that should give you everything you need to roll your own function .. i would probably spend a bit of time seeing if there are plugins that do something similar already, though ..
[10:00:18] <sanjayb> computer2000: i'll say once again though, it seems more like you have a problem with either the structure of your markup or what you're trying to do exactly, and i would really suggest fixing that instead of going down this path .. but if you must, its probably possible, just maybe a bit slow / inefficient, depends a lot on how many DOM elements you have on the page, how many you're querying, etc.
[10:00:39] <chilversc_> sacho: which one? foo[bar]=5 or foo.bar=5?, they're both x-www-form-urlencoded, just different server frameworks expecting the keys in different formats
[10:03:53] <sanjayb> chilversc_, what's the server frame-work that wants foo.bar? Are you sure it doesn't want a JSON string or something?
[10:05:47] <MrMaffen> does anybody know how I can retrieve an image's content (meaning its bytes) from an img element out of my dom tree?
[10:05:54] <sanjayb> chilversc_, can you paste the code you're using to serialize the form data and send it to the server?
[10:06:49] <MrMaffen> I'm trying to download an image by adding an img element to my dom tree. And now I want to somehow access the image's bytes in my onLoad callback.
[10:06:51] <sanjayb> MrMaffen, what's your use case? You can write it to a <canvas> element and read the image data, but that's not exactly the bytes.
[10:07:35] <MrMaffen> sanjayb: My first approach was to download the image with an ajax call. But then I ran into problems with the same-origin-policy
[10:07:38] <sanjayb> MrMaffen: "download" where? you want to add an image to the DOM tree and have it download on the user's computer?
[10:08:12] <MrMaffen> sanjayb: I want to pu itt into a zip-file within my js script.
[10:08:16] <MrMaffen> put it*
[10:08:33] <MrMaffen> this already works when I'm using an ajax call to download the image(s)
[10:08:48] <MrMaffen> But yeah... my current approach is to circumvent the SOP problems by using the img element
[10:08:59] <computer2000> sanjayb: thx
[10:09:01] <chilversc_> sanjayb: nope, its currently just expecting x-www-form-urlencoded, and I'm currently just delegating it to jquery.ajax, which uses jQuery.param
[10:09:41] <jnewt> i've got a dialog which is reloaded periodically via setInterval to get updates to the status of a server-side process.  at some point, the process is complete and i can stop reloading.  how should i notify the browser side to clearInterval?
[10:09:44] <MrMaffen> sanjayb: so what I basically need is the image content so that I can push it into my zip-file (all on the client side)
[10:10:46] <sanjayb> MrMaffen: You could look into writing to a canvas and then getting base64 encoding of the image and using that .. however, I have a feeling being able to write external images to <canvas> might suffer from the same Cross-Origin issues - you'll need to look that up, my memory is fuzzy.
[10:11:06] <MrMaffen> sanjayb: yeah I have the same feeling :/
[10:11:22] <chilversc_> sanjayb: here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/LehYn/
[10:11:30] <sanjayb> MrMaffen: In general, it seems a lot more sane to have the client send the image paths to the server and have the server generate this zip file? But I'm guessing there's a good reason not to do that for you?
[10:12:46] <MrMaffen> sanjayb: yea I'm trying to avoid the server-side alltogether. I've struggled a lot to do this, and I'm almost there. If there wasn't this pita SOP :D
[10:13:27] <MrMaffen> works pretty efficient too... JSzip is such an awesome library for my use-case
[10:13:29] <sanjayb> chilversc_, so don't use $.param() when sending to the server? convert the data to a string as your server expects it and pass the string directly to the data: option in your $.ajax call ?
[10:14:22] <sanjayb> MrMaffen: ha! sounds cool ;) .. if you have some code you want to paste, I can take a look - let me look into this writing external images to <canvas> business .. if you can get the image to a <canvas>, you should be able to get a PNG from it that you can use as data.
[10:14:30] <chilversc_> sanjayb: yeah, I was just seeing if there's a way to change the format before I go writing a load of code to do this, no point re-inventing the wheel if it already exists
[10:16:11] <Erneston> i have a strange request, does anyone here have blu ray movies?
[10:19:15] <sanjayb> chilversc_, yea, good question -- essentially, there are easy plugins to get back JSON objects from forms, but then you'd probably need to do the to string conversion yourself if the server requires a different format .. I could totally be missing something though, so don't give up hunting :P
[10:19:51] <sanjayb> ok am on my way out - cheers guys. MrMaffen, am curious to know if you find a solution, though :)
[10:20:38] <MrMaffen> sanjayb: hehe yea. ping me tomorrow or some other time. I'm sure I'll find a solution in the next few hours :P
[10:20:48] <MrMaffen> cheers
[10:21:19] <Yatekii> Guys simple question: is JQuaery qualified to draw things like a graphics lib or can you reccomend one?
[10:21:24] <Yatekii> *jQuery
[10:32:57] <J11> I was wondering if it's possible to override the way datatables fetches its data. As I want to filter on many columns wrapped over multiple rows.(perhaps using multiple tbody to group the lines)
[10:36:35] <ezakimak_work> is jquery-migrate not hosted on google cdn?
[10:37:43] <Cork> it is
[10:37:59] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js
[10:38:52] <Cork> oh i missed google in there
[10:39:44] <Cork> ezakimak_work: nope it doesn't look like it
[10:41:08] <ezakimak_work> i don't understand why google's cdn is so limited
[10:50:38] <JFranks> If you wanted to change all <img src="/foo/...  to <img src="http://site.com/foo/..."   could jQuery tackle it and would the browser update all the broken images?
[10:53:38] <frank_o_> Hello guys. Say you have "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" and "a, b, c, d", how do you combine them into "1, 2, a, 3, b, c, 4, d, 5" (random placements, but the order of each list is preserved)? Work in progress: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zsn6j/9/
[11:15:10] <BillCriswell> JFranks: The request for /foo/img.jpg will still be made I believe. You should look into handling that server side.
[11:17:30] <ezakimak_work> the browser should update the images from the new src location, afaiu
[11:18:14] <BillCriswell> JFranks: Yeha, the images will be updated, but you'll be wasting valuable HTTP requests.
[11:20:58] <BillCriswell> frank_o_: There's Underscore's .zip() method that might help?
[11:22:13] <BillCriswell> frank_o_: _.flatten(_.zip([1,2,3,4,5],['a','b','c','d','e'])) for example
[11:22:25] <BillCriswell> frank_o_: Would result in: [1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c", 4, "d", 5, "e"]
[11:23:10] <frank_o_> BillCriswell: Cool. Any chance to make that random though?
[11:23:16] <jnewt> does jquery have a  built in way to turn form data into JSON without using a plugin? i can't figure out the best way with all the serialize / serializeArray toJSON etc functions.
[11:25:59] <BillCriswell> jnewt: You can use .serializeArray() and each to make a more "traditional" json object.
[11:26:51] <BillCriswell> jnewt: var person = {}; $.each( $('form').serializeArray(), function(idx, field){ person[field.name] = field.value; });
[11:27:12] <BillCriswell> then person.first_name would be "Bill" or whatever.
[11:31:19] <jnewt> BillCriswell, $('form').serializeArray() should return the keys even if the inputs are empty right?  i keep getting an empty object back.
[11:33:02] <BillCriswell> jnewt: Should return like [ { name: "first_name", value: "" } ] in the event of an empty one.
[11:34:28] <jnewt> ah, it needs name="" not just id="" on all the inputs.  got it, thanks.
[11:34:41] <BillCriswell> jnewt: Yessum.
[11:40:34] <BillCriswell> frank_o_: Not sure.
[11:41:26] <frank_o_> Cooking something up, will show in a sec

[11:41:47] <jedimind> hurry up frank_o_
[11:45:32] <Yatekii> Ahm guys, can I use jquery asa graphics lib? I mean is there something like draw_stuff()?
[11:45:42] <Yatekii> *draw_circle(x,y,r)
[11:46:39] <BillCriswell> Yatekii: I mean, you _could_, but you'd be better off using something built for the task.
[11:46:56] <Yatekii> BillCriswell: anny recommendations? :)
[11:46:58] <Yatekii> *any
[11:48:03] <BillCriswell> Yatekii: I played with this a bit over the weekend. Seems very promising: http://snapsvg.io/
[11:49:41] <Yatekii> kkty
[11:51:24] <Whiskey> $("#saveText").html("Save This"); <-- # is id right?
[11:52:08] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: Without knowing the HTML there's no way to know.
[11:52:55] <Whiskey> well else # is id or class
[11:53:12] <Whiskey> can´t be anything else don´t see the problem
[11:53:32] <Whiskey> you prob don´know jquery http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[11:53:34] <Whiskey> it was id
[11:53:41] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: No idea.
[11:54:20] <Whiskey> you know jQuery?
[11:54:57] <rmah> yes, # means id
[11:55:16] <Yatekii> BillCriswell: looks brilliant
[12:05:13] <Bloomberg> Guys !!
[12:05:40] <jedimind> damnit
[12:05:41] * jedimind hids
[12:05:42] <jedimind> hides*
[12:17:41] <Whiskey> how do i select a id, and change text on it?
[12:18:41] <Whiskey> but first i need to select it and see what it says
[12:25:09] <Krinkle> here's mine: https://github.com/Krinkle/dotfiles/blob/master/hosts/KrinkleMac/SublimePreferences.json I can recommend "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save", "rulers". Theme and color scheme may be interesting as well.
[12:25:11] <Krinkle> Ugh
[12:25:15] <Krinkle> wrong channel
[12:25:50] <WebDragon> http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=analytics  the last three listed seem to be exactly the same -- bug in the search query engine ?
[12:26:35] <frank_o_> BillCriswell: Got http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zsn6j/18/ almost there if you'd care to take a look
[12:27:07] <frank_o_> Sorry http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zsn6j/19/
[12:42:41] <regedit_> in an event handler, how do i return in a way that will resume the event off on its regular course unimpeded as if there was no handler?
[12:43:04] <regedit_> return? return true? return false? other?
[12:48:21] <sanjayb> regedit, return true; .. im pretty sure as long as you're NOT returning false or calling event.preventDefault(), the event will continue on its regular course ..
[12:48:40] <regedit> sanjayb: awesome, thanks
[13:07:40] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone know if you make an ajax call on onunload it will always hit the server before the page changes?
[13:42:16] <Pyche> hey, im having trouble with a template i bought - it came stock to use AJAX based loads into the content window of the site. But I don't want to load via AJAX.  So I edited the code, but now I can't remove #undefined from appearing in the URL after clicking a <a> link or a <form> submit.  Is there a global Jquery setting I'm missing somewhere?
[13:43:06] <Cork> Pyche: no, the script/template must be doing something
[13:43:53] <Pyche> Cork: do you know the ajax api that'd trigger that so I can do a search?
[13:43:55] <Velveeta> yeah it sounds to me like it's intercepting all anchor clicks on the page in order to target what content it used to load into the content area
[13:44:09] <Cork> Pyche: it doens't
[13:44:20] <Pyche> yea, using the "hash" it's setting
[13:44:35] <Cork> Pyche: what triggers it is a call to location.hash or a call to history.pushState
[13:44:39] <Pyche> ive been searching google, editing local code.. but cant get rid of #undefined
[13:45:05] <Cork> Pyche: and none of those are used by jquery by default
[13:45:08] <Pyche> parent.location.hash = ''
[13:45:15] <Pyche> k
[13:45:40] <Cork> well it could edit the href of the link too
[13:45:46] <Cork> but that is not likely
[13:46:22] <Pyche> no, it doesnt
[13:46:25] <Pyche> it hijacks
[13:46:26] <Pyche> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[13:47:27] <duch_kazatel> Pyche that's a plugin.
[13:47:52] <Pyche> that's the pluging thats messing me up though, right?
[13:48:09] <Pyche> though, i comment it out .. #undefined is still there..
[13:48:10] <duch_kazatel> probably not.  there's a native hashchange event.
[13:48:22] <duch_kazatel> but you're not watching for hashchange evenbts.
[13:48:23] <duch_kazatel> *events
[13:48:29] <duch_kazatel> you're looking for things that change the hash.
[13:49:16] <Pyche> when i comment out, "jquery.tools.min.js", the hash is not posted to the URL
[13:49:58] <duch_kazatel> cool?  hard to know what's in jquery.tools.min.js
[13:50:38] <Pyche> http://jsfiddle.net/Szegg/
[13:50:45] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[13:51:15] <Pyche> i tried commenting out some stuff there, but it doesnt appear to work
[13:51:31] <Cork> i suspect it is the jquery ui alternative
[13:51:32] <Pyche> im looking for instances of "hash" but not sure if thats even the right thing to be fixing
[13:51:35] <duch_kazatel> that's because that's not your problem.
[13:51:47] <duch_kazatel> that's just a lib that some other code is using.
[13:52:56] <Pyche> duch_kazatel: if I comment out that script, the hashtag issue is gone though. so doesnt it have to be something in that script?
[13:53:10] <duch_kazatel> Pyche something is using part of that lib.
[13:53:25] <Cork> Pyche: tools is a interface lib
[13:53:31] <Pyche> k
[13:53:33] <duch_kazatel> don't modify the lib - modify the code that's calling the lib.
[13:53:45] <Cork> ?g jquery tools
[13:53:50] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery TOOLS - The missing UI library for the Web → http://jquerytools.org/
[13:53:51] <Velveeta> i found it in about 5 seconds by searching for #
[13:54:26] <Velveeta> setInterval(function(){var a=d.contentWindow.document;a=a.location.hash;g!==a&&b.event.trigger("hash",a)},100);h(location.hash||"#")}}else setInterval(function(){var a=location.hash;a!==g&&b.event.trigger("hash",a)},100);
[13:54:36] <codeshah> anyone using twitter-typeaehad
[13:54:38] <codeshah> ahead agh
[13:54:56] <Velveeta> there's a running poll that fires every 100ms and checks for a hash change in the url
[13:54:58] <duch_kazatel> no way.  that thing is actually watching for URL changes every 100 ms?
[13:55:00] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[13:55:04] <Velveeta> yepyep
[13:55:06] <duch_kazatel> classy
[13:55:09] <Pyche> i told you
[13:55:16] <Pyche> the guy edited that script
[13:55:21] <duch_kazatel> Pyche huh?
[13:55:28] <Cork> that sounds like the hashchange fallback
[13:55:31] <Velveeta> you know, gotta keep it running a peak efficiency and all that :D
[13:55:38] <duch_kazatel> that's so dirty
[13:56:01] <Velveeta> cork: good call, it looks like an ie7 fallback
[13:56:02] <Velveeta> if(b.browser.msie&&b.browser.version<"8")
[13:56:08] <Cork> ya
[13:56:10] <duch_kazatel> Pyche that's not your problem.
[13:56:30] <Velveeta> so that's another thing that'll be broken depending on when you choose to upgrade your version of jquery, since it relies on the $.browser object, which is now deprecated
[13:56:45] <Velveeta> i say just pull the whole thing out, unless there's something specific in it that you need
[13:56:51] <Pyche> I dont need it
[13:56:55] <Velveeta> then yank it
[13:57:07] <duch_kazatel> Pyche make sure the template doesn't start throwing JS errors after yanking it.
[13:57:22] <Pyche> well, one thing isn't firing. a slider
[13:57:32] <duch_kazatel> but it was earlier?
[13:57:41] <Cork> Pyche: a slider or a slideshow?
[13:57:55] <Pyche> a menu, slides in, slides out
[13:58:00] <Pyche> yea
[13:58:10] <Cork> ah, an animation
[13:58:24] <Pyche> "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'validator' of undefined global.js:39 (anonymous function)"
[13:58:27] <duch_kazatel> then you're going to need to monkeypatch it or actually modify the javascript that implements the feature.
[13:58:27] <Cork> Pyche: sounds like it depends on jquery tools
[13:59:36] <Pyche> yea, it does
[13:59:48] <duch_kazatel> then the tools file isn't your problem.
[14:00:00] <Pyche> when I add the CDN script, <script src="http://cdn.jquerytools.org/1.2.7/full/jquery.tools.min.js"></script>, slider works but #hashtags reappear in URL
[14:00:01] <Cork> well it might be, but not very likely
[14:00:34] <Cork> i've heard a bit too much bad about jquery tools to give it a green card :)
[14:00:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:00:58] <duch_kazatel> my whole point is that it likely doens't actually implement on its own.
[14:01:39] <Cork> likely ya, but i wouldn't be surprised if it did
[14:02:05] <Velveeta> yeah one would think there's at least a config option somewhere that could disable that behavior
[14:02:07] <Cork> it just wouldn't be my first place to look for it
[14:02:27] <Velveeta> but one would also think developers out in the ether architect their code with common sense in mind
[14:02:41] <Cork> depends
[14:02:51] <Cork> if it is meant to be complete packages
[14:02:56] <Cork> it normally isn't
[14:03:08] <Velveeta> right, if you're getting something specifically for a purpose, thens ure
[14:03:16] <Cork> if it is a small peas meant to be used as a plugin, it is normally much better
[14:03:25] <Velveeta> but something called "tools" sounds like an assortment of items, which you would think would be individually togglable
[14:03:41] <adamsilver> Is there a better way to say this: $(this).parent('p').parent('div').addClass('hidden'); ?
[14:03:44] <Cork> Velveeta: it is quite similar to jquery ui
[14:04:02] <Cork> adamsilver: .closest('div').addClas('hidden')
[14:04:03] <Velveeta> cork: right, and jquery ui doesn't automatically instantiate anything, you have to do it yourself
[14:04:10] <duch_kazatel> adamsilver $(this).parents('div').addClass('hidden');
[14:04:24] <duch_kazatel> depending on what exactly you're trying to target.
[14:04:26] <Cork> duch_kazatel: no that isn't the same thing
[14:04:42] <Cork> duch_kazatel: your code would add hidden to all parent divs in the tree
[14:04:46] <duch_kazatel> Cork like I said, depending on what you want to accplish ;)
[14:04:48] <Cork> not just the closest one
[14:04:57] <duch_kazatel> I'd normally target an ID.
[14:04:59] <duch_kazatel> or a Class.
[14:05:24] <Cork> well class it fine, id tends to make the code rigid and inflexible

[14:10:14] <Pyche> Cork: what do you think I should with this tools script?
[14:10:51] <Cork> Pyche: if the package you want to use is built around it; you don't really have much choice
[14:11:16] <grafi> wow. much choice. so amaze
[14:11:28] <duch_kazatel> such jquery

[14:11:46] <duch_kazatel> wow
[14:11:51] <Cork> <_<
[14:11:53] <Pyche> shouldn't there be a way to remove the part that is adding the hash tho?
[14:11:53] <grafi> very s3
[14:12:05] <Cork> are you guys bored or something?
[14:12:22] <grafi> i am sad to admi that i am
[14:12:28] <Cork> :)
[14:12:41] <duch_kazatel> Pyche that file is not where the problem lies.
[14:12:49] <duch_kazatel> there's another js file that is breaking things for you.
[14:12:59] <grafi> did the problem not tell the truth?
[14:13:04] <Velveeta> i'm so bored, i'm watching a horrendous quality version of best of major payne clips

[14:13:16] <grafi> much bored
[14:13:17] <grafi> xD
[14:13:18] <Pyche> duck_kazatel why do you think that?
[14:13:36] <duch_kazatel> Pyche because I highly doubt that file implements the feature.
[14:15:29] <Pyche> duch_kazatel: http://jquerytools.org/demos/tabs/ajax-history.html#ajax1.htm
[14:15:33] <Pyche> you dont think its like that?
[14:15:43] <duch_kazatel> ....
[14:15:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:16:04] <Pyche> that demo, its pretty similar to what im experiencing
[14:16:14] <Pyche> you click a link, it posts that hash to the url
[14:16:27] <duch_kazatel> great?
[14:17:02] <Cork> Pyche: then look for history: true
[14:17:15] <duch_kazatel> Pyche is that the plugin that's being used?
[14:17:15] <Cork> as that is the config option for it
[14:17:31] <duch_kazatel> or is that just an example of something you found that resembles what you have?
[14:17:37] <Cork> duch_kazatel: it is part of tools
[14:18:25] <grafi> man
[14:18:32] <grafi> red john is getting away again
[14:18:45] <Cork> "red john"?

[14:19:09] <Cork> grafi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnnHprUGKF0 ? ;P
[14:19:12] <duch_kazatel> Cork so that plugin is in the tools?
[14:19:19] <pixelpimp> i remember that show.. haven't watched in a while.  red john was like the worst villain ever
[14:19:21] <grafi> Cork no!
[14:19:26] <pixelpimp> terrible name especially
[14:19:28] <grafi> worst?
[14:19:33] <grafi> i think hes the best
[14:19:33] <grafi> :P
[14:19:40] <Cork> duch_kazatel: not really a plugin, it is in the mish-mash called jquery-tools
[14:19:41] <Pyche> cork: history: true just adds the 'previous tab' to the browser history list
[14:19:45] <Cork> it isn't plugin based
[14:19:56] <grafi> tiger tiger burning bright in the middle of the night
[14:20:11] <grafi> pixelpimp i think this season they'll catch him
[14:20:12] <Pyche> i dont want the hashtag to appear at all
[14:20:46] <duch_kazatel> Cork ... my question was if the page Pyche link was the code responsible for the hashchange.  I'm trying to figure out why Pyche is so confused.
[14:21:13] <Pyche> i pasted in the jquerytools demo
[14:21:39] <Cork> duch_kazatel: not sure if it is responsible, but that page demos part of what the tools give you
[14:21:39] <Pyche> their official page.. which also has the same "add hash to url" feature
[14:21:47] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaaah i didn't see that.
[14:21:57] <grafi> such confuse
[14:21:58] <grafi> oô
[14:21:59] <duch_kazatel> sorry doing too many things at once :-P
[14:22:18] <Pyche> thats why i think it is the tool thats causing the issue, cause even their demo page -- not just my "custom script"-- is having the issue
[14:22:46] <Pyche> i want to strip this stupid hashtag/a link hijacking element from the core file
[14:22:46] <grafi> why not just not care?
[14:22:47] <grafi> ^^
[14:22:49] <duch_kazatel> the custom script will contain a block similar to the section named JavaScript coding
[14:23:01] <duch_kazatel> look for .tabs(
[14:23:30] <duch_kazatel> and change the 'effect' and 'history' options.
[14:24:02] <grafi> you're a wizard 'arry
[14:26:40] <Pyche> duck_kazatel: I found some.. but nothing is clear. I changed on effect to NULL, it didnt do anything
[14:26:56] <Pyche> can you take a look? recommend something? http://jsfiddle.net/Szegg/
[14:27:04] <duch_kazatel> ....
[14:27:12] <duch_kazatel> i very much doubt it's in that file.
[14:27:23] <duch_kazatel> *the options, I mean.
[14:27:44] <Pyche> it is i think
[14:28:09] <Pyche> line 39
[14:28:21] <duch_kazatel> if you think I'm wrong, why ask for my help?
[14:28:30] <duch_kazatel> what are all the javascript files in this template?
[14:29:33] <Pyche> i think you think "no one would be dumb enough to code like that" .. but they did..
[14:30:00] <grafi> its nice "listening" to you two
[14:30:04] <duch_kazatel> no.  I read the docs.
[14:30:11] <duch_kazatel> but okay.

[14:31:07] <Pyche> one of which is: jquery.hashchange.min.js, but I comment that out -- and the issue is still there

[14:48:50] <xid_> With j=UI datepicker, I am switching regional setting onClose, then back again onCliock, but doing the same for $('[data-handler=next'])click is not working
[14:49:56] <xid_> hmm i think i need to use the onChangeMonthYear option
[14:50:01] <xid_> callback thing
[14:52:22] <xid_> lol except now the new months are not respecting the settings originally set in onClose
[14:55:49] <duch_kazatel> www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYyBZE0kBtE
[14:55:54] <duch_kazatel> woops wrong channel.
[14:56:00] <duch_kazatel> still a funny song though
[14:56:16] <xid_> would be nice if I could set a region for both the datepicker object, and the input value
[14:56:56] <xid_> much easier than all these callbacks
[14:58:18] <xid_> maybe beforeShow will work
[14:59:04] <grafi> xid_ what oô
[14:59:14] <xid_> datepicker woes
[14:59:31] <grafi> that much I got
[14:59:45] <grafi> but not the stuff with the regions
[14:59:54] <xid_> switching between two languages (regions)
[14:59:58] <xid_> is difficult
[15:00:15] <grafi> why
[15:00:17] <xid_> need to display the date picker in English, but output in Spanish
[15:00:32] <grafi> ha
[15:00:40] <xid_> because this site will be catering to Americans ordering on behalf of Spanish speakers
[15:01:40] <grafi> i'd say its hard because its a bad idea :P
[15:01:50] <grafi> but dont let me interrupt you
[15:01:55] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:02:03] <xid_> agreed
[15:02:13] <duch_kazatel> store normalized, display however you'd like.
[15:03:14] <grafi> the old why take two trips if i can carry it all at once conundrum
[15:03:14] <grafi> :P
[15:06:18] <xid_> but what's the alternative
[15:06:21] <xid_> make people learn spanish
[15:06:33] <xid_> or use another i18n solution
[15:06:40] <xid_> to pile on top of j=ui
[15:06:51] <xid_> i think i'll get it after i fidddle more with event callbacks
[15:07:03] <grafi> im not saying it cant be done ^^
[15:07:11] <xid_> ;)
[15:07:23] <grafi> its just confuses me, and im not even the one who has to use it
[15:07:44] <xid_> it'll be more confusing if i insert a translation table in the sidebar
[15:07:49] <xid_> then they'll be looking back and forth
[15:08:02] <grafi> walk me trough a use case oô
[15:09:09] <xid_> American administrators will log on and order variable data printed products, coupons, brochures, and posters and such, and enter an expiration date.  Rather than expect them to remember the Spanish date formats, jQuery-ui i18n will do it for them
[15:09:14] <xid_> and they'll never have to learn spanish
[15:10:14] <grafi> so basically its cool for the admin to enter a date like they normally would
[15:10:26] <grafi> and where does the spanish format come in?
[15:10:41] <xid_> jquery-ui has i18n language packs
[15:10:44] <xid_> and you can make your own
[15:10:44] <grafi> sure
[15:10:52] <xid_> so it inserts the value in spanish
[15:10:58] <xid_> but displays the UI in english
[15:11:05] <grafi> but where would it insert the value?
[15:11:11] <xid_> in the input
[15:11:14] <xid_> in the form
[15:11:19] <grafi> and then i submit the form?
[15:11:31] <xid_> yes, and the date value will print on the coupons
[15:11:35] <xid_> or poster, or whatever
[15:11:38] <xid_> in Spanish
[15:11:55] <grafi> so why not convert the date on the backend
[15:12:03] <xid_> it would be safer
[15:12:11] <xid_> but don't have the budget to do it that way
[15:12:13] <grafi> it would be far less confusing
[15:12:21] <grafi> budget
[15:12:21] <grafi> oô
[15:12:32] <xid_> it's not confusing
[15:12:35] <xid_> because it's a hidden input
[15:12:40] <grafi> i see
[15:12:45] <grafi> at least
[15:12:55] <xid_> it renders the PDF with variables on the screen as JPG after each update
[15:13:36] <grafi> so do you need the full date or are you just shoving day and month around?
[15:13:49] <xid_> depends... we have several formats
[15:13:53] <grafi> hm
[15:13:56] <xid_> some with strings, some only int
[15:14:07] <xid_> depending on the product
[15:15:07] <grafi> it might be easier to see how jqueryui converts the date internally, and extract that
[15:15:19] <grafi> so you dont need to fuzz around with the whole datepicker thing
[15:15:34] <grafi> just save the date, copy to a hidden input, convert
[15:15:46] <grafi> no callbacks, no changing regions etc
[15:17:50] <grafi> xid_ there also appears to be an altField option, along with an altFormat options in the datepicker, i wonder if that does exactly what you want
[15:17:58] <xid_> interesting
[15:18:53] <grafi> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-altField
[15:19:14] <grafi> not familiar enough with the whole i18n process though
[15:20:30] <duckx0r> How can I pass the $(this) object to a function? When I do this http://pastebin.com/3ULtiSmL I am assuming the $(this) used within the function is something specific to that scope and not the $(this) used previously.
[15:20:58] <xid_> yes i think that may do it
[15:21:29] <xid_> especially since it allows you alternate options
[15:21:48] <Korvin> I'm getting some strange behavior with .add not working: http://jsfiddle.net/zZpru/
[15:24:00] <Korvin> without the chaining, it still happens: http://jsfiddle.net/zZpru/1/
[15:25:31] <xid_> grafi: too bad it doesn't have altDayNames or altMonthNames options
[15:26:03] <grafi> yeah im not sure if you could include that somehow in the altFormat thing ...
[15:26:15] <grafi> the documentation confuses me at that point
[15:26:24] <grafi> its pointing to fomatDate
[15:27:02] <Sal> hi does anyone have a example on sending data to php and then reading back json data from it?
[15:27:36] <rogi> say you have one = $('#one') and two = $('#two') how do you set 'change' listener to both ?
[15:27:38] <Sal> i already sent an object to a php file, but i have problems working on the returned data
[15:28:39] <Korvin> Sal, die(json_encode(array('some'=>'info)));
[15:29:31] <Sal> Korvin, i'm using json_encode on php already
[15:29:55] <Sal> its the returnd thata inside the ajax.success that i have problems reading
[15:30:18] <Sal> let me show you what i get back
[15:30:40] <Node_005> join #postgresql
[15:31:31] <Sal> Korvin, http://i.imgur.com/RKMH83h.png
[15:32:23] <Sal> all is returned inside data - success: function(data) {...}
[15:32:30] <Korvin> so what's the issue?
[15:32:39] <Korvin> JSON.parse(data)
[15:32:48] <Sal> but when i try to alert data.numRoes, i get an undefined message
[15:32:59] <Sal> oh
[15:38:29] <Cork> uh
[15:38:51] <Cork> Sal: fix the server to send the correct content-type header and that should fix it self
[15:39:15] <Cork> you should normally not need to do JSON.parse on an ajax call
[15:40:00] <Sal> Cork: how? is there any sample that you know of that i can see?
[15:40:13] <Sal> all i did was a json encode on the php part
[15:40:14] <Cork> is the json generated?
[15:40:17] <Cork> ah
[15:40:25] <Cork> ?g php header
[15:40:25] <b-ot> Cork: PHP: header - Manual → http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[15:40:41] <Cork> set the header to Content-Type: application/json
[15:40:46] <Cork> and the rest should work
[15:41:15] <grafi> Content-Type: application/just-work
[15:42:32] <frank_o> I'm trying to shuffle two lists while keeping their original order, eg. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" and "a, b, c, d" would become say "1, 2, a, 3, b, c, 4, d, 5".
[15:42:34] <frank_o> I got http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zsn6j/32/ working by taking these two lists and creating a 3rd list. But instead, how do I insert the 1st list directly into the 2nd one while still achieving the same result?
[15:44:23] <duch_kazatel> frank_o just create a temp array and then overrwrite the 2nd one.
[15:44:25] <Sal> Cork, thanks, seems to work now
[15:44:43] <duch_kazatel> frank_o though that request is pretty unusual.  what's the goal?
[15:46:01] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: I'm afraid the contents of the 2nd list cannot be touched. I wrote a brief explanation in that fiddle if you could have a look.
[15:48:02] <duch_kazatel> wait so you can't modify #2 at all?
[15:48:16] <duch_kazatel> then how is what you'r asking possible?
[15:48:43] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: I can insert new stuff into #2, just not modify its existing stuff
[15:49:10] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to modify it because you'll have to move elements within the array.
[15:50:26] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Yep that part is ok. What I mean is that I can't modify the stuff in #2 prior to moving in the new elements
[15:51:21] <frank_o> I.e. I'm allowed to insert the content from #1 in between #2's <li><div id="adsense_wrapper">AdSense 1</a></li> and <li><div id="adsense_wrapper">AdSense 2</a></li>
[15:52:34] <duch_kazatel> wait is this about HTML or about arrays?
[15:53:52] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Please see http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zsn6j/32/ -- I'm pretty sure it's about arrays
[15:56:11] <duch_kazatel> ... I DID look.  You keep talking about "not being able to touch #2" and then pasted HTML into chat ;)
[15:57:24] <duch_kazatel> if you want to insert into the array while keeping everything else,  yourArray.splice(2, 0, toInsert);
[15:57:34] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Yes, #2 is a ul made out of two li's. I can't touch those two li's. But I can insert more uls into #2
[15:57:45] <frank_o> * insert more li's into #2 :)
[15:58:17] <frank_o> hmm yeah
[15:58:41] <frank_o> I'm not sure #2's array would be needed anymore now that I can't combine #1 and #2 into #3, right?
[15:59:33] <zakj> frank_o: assuming you are moving items from "a" into "b". maintain an index into b, starting at 0. for each element in a, randomly do/don't increment bIndex, then splice (or insertBefore, if you're using jquery elements) the a item into b at bIndex.
[16:00:51] <frank_o> zakj: Wicked stuff man!
[16:01:42] <frank_o> thanks a lot.. should be proper fun this one

[16:18:48] <safani> this is weird as i swear i've done this a million times before
[16:18:56] <safani> it is only working with a string
[16:20:46] <sacho> You're not using "thedata" as an array.
[16:20:54] <sacho> make it a regular object.
[16:21:13] <safani> ?
[16:21:58] <sacho> change thedata = [] to thedata = {}
[16:22:29] <frank_o> zakj: Oh wow :)
[16:22:36] <safani> man wtf
[16:22:58] <frank_o> Never in a million years would I be able to come up with something like that!

[16:59:27] <sayd> I have a function call inside a _create function inside a jquery widget: why would i have to use: f.call(me, 1); instead of just f(1)? me is a reference to this inside the create function
[17:01:23] <sayd> i mean isnt this the default scope a functio nis run in
[17:04:04] <sayd> i guess its the context the function is defined in which is inside a $ closure, which is just declared at the top (global)
[17:11:04] <abailarri_> I implemented a jquery scrolltotop in muy web, but it not works with jquery 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8. Anyone can say me an equivalent function?
[17:14:02] <petey_> Do you want to return false; and preventDefault() on a click that just shows/hides elements?
[17:14:06] <petey_> Or will one or the other suffice?
[17:15:34] <grafi> you almost never want return false;
[17:16:14] <petey_> Really? someone here told me to return false the other day
[17:16:54] <grafi> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[17:17:00] <petey_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1357118/event-preventdefault-vs-return-false
[17:17:43] <unnu> i wouldn't say almost never . . . . if you have a function that checks if a number is even lets say, isEven(number) should return true or false ? if you want a bool answer then you need a bool result
[17:18:08] <grafi> thats not in the context of event handlers though ;)
[17:19:34] <petey_> Yeah I just have a .toggle(); going
[17:19:40] <petey_> Thank you for the article grafi
