[13:22:31] <robertparkerx> How would I be able to get the values from .exclude_ids without just $('.exclude_ids').val()
[13:22:45] <robertparkerx> The reason I ask is soon there will be more tabs and I'm tryingto make it dynamic
[13:23:00] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx so you mean how would you get all of the values?
[13:23:22] <robertparkerx> I have tried $(this).closest('.text-center').prev('exclude_ids').val() but it doesn't work
[13:23:28] <robertparkerx> yes
[13:23:36] <robertparkerx> I know I need to json.parse after
[13:23:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:23:49] <robertmaxrees> that second line you shared doesn't make sense with the question.
[13:24:03] <robertparkerx> I know
[13:24:05] <robertmaxrees> and you shouldn't need to use json.parse - can you share some markup?
[13:24:17] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/36
[13:24:19] <robertparkerx> Sorry
[13:24:22] <robertparkerx> I thought I shared this
[13:24:41] <robertparkerx> It's at the bottom
[13:24:46] <robertmaxrees> super lost now.
[13:25:07] <robertmaxrees> are you asking how to transform that value into an array?
[13:25:20] <robertparkerx> no just get the values from .exclude_ids
[13:25:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:25:45] <robertmaxrees> "values" implies there's more than one value=, which there is not.  there is a single value attribute that looks like a JSON array.
[13:25:52] <robertparkerx> if there was another tab too, just get those closest values
[13:26:00] <robertparkerx> yes
[13:26:10] <robertparkerx> value*
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> okay, then yeah - JSON.parse($('.exclude-ids').val());
[13:26:35] <robertmaxrees> what's this about "closest"?
[13:26:48] <robertparkerx> yes but I don't need that it should support if there were two tabs
[13:26:53] <robertparkerx> and two .exclude_id
[13:26:55] <robertmaxrees> "tabs"?
[13:27:02] <robertparkerx> yes the class i named
[13:27:03] <robertmaxrees> update the markup to show what you mean.
[13:27:52] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/37
[13:28:46] <robertparkerx> if I use just a single selector it will pull the same one everytime
[13:28:50] <robertmaxrees> okay so stop.
[13:28:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:28:52] <robertparkerx> not the closest to the loadmore
[13:28:56] <robertmaxrees> slow down - you have two questions here.
[13:29:19] <robertparkerx> ok
[13:29:19] <robertmaxrees> 1 - you need to get the val() for all .exclude-ids on the page.
[13:29:28] <robertmaxrees> 2 - you need to turn those two values into a single array.
[13:29:28] <robertmaxrees> yes?
[13:29:37] <robertparkerx> 1 - just the closest to the .loadmore
[13:29:43] <robertparkerx> 2 - no
[13:29:50] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating what "closest" means.
[13:30:10] <robertparkerx> it looks for the parent like parent
[13:30:12] <robertparkerx> but it's wrong
[13:30:17] <robertparkerx> I just mean in english
[13:30:19] <robertmaxrees> that input is not a parent of .loadmore
[13:30:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:30:28] <robertparkerx> I know I did it wrong
[13:30:53] <robertmaxrees> but alright, so on click of loadmore, you want to grab the .exclude-ids contained within the same .tab?
[13:31:00] <robertparkerx> yes
[13:31:02] <robertparkerx> exactly
[13:32:02] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so update https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9rwkb65p/ with what you've got so far.
[13:33:43] <robertparkerx> it doesn't let me scroll to load more
[13:33:54] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/ab8fc497/
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> you mean you can't see the bottom load more link?
[13:34:13] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees robertparkerx thanks for demonstrating the benefits of a nick color script
[13:34:25] <robertparkerx> lol
[13:34:44] <robertmaxrees> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1avfnw28/ just adding a few linebreaks solves that
[13:34:50] <robertmaxrees> lmao * robertparkerx
[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> so robertparkerx what you really want is to go up to the containing .tab and then find the .exclude_uds
[13:36:04] <robertparkerx> .find and .find again ?
[13:36:12] <robertparkerx> or closest and find
[13:36:22] <robertmaxrees> .find() looks at descendents.  .closest() is what you want.
[13:36:27] <robertmaxrees> .closest() and .find()
[13:37:08] <robertmaxrees> now you also mentioned something about this being "dynamic" - do you mean that you're adding more .tab elements when "load more" is clicked?
[13:38:06] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/ohf69pe5/ I cannot get it
[13:38:20] <robertparkerx> yes
[13:38:30] <robertparkerx> I have a previous script that is working I'm just trying to adapt
[13:38:30] <robertmaxrees> there's no .vp-tabs on that fiddle?
[13:39:33] <robertparkerx> I removed it sorry
[13:39:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:39:37] <robertparkerx> it says undefined
[13:39:43] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/ohf69pe5/1/
[13:39:57] <robertparkerx> crap
[13:40:04] <robertparkerx> exclude-ids and not exclude_ids
[13:40:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:40:39] <robertparkerx> got it
[13:40:48] <robertparkerx> Really appreciate you robertmaxrees
[13:40:48] <robertmaxrees> now your second issue - you can't use .click() for this because those tab elements are getting added dynamically.
[13:41:00] <robertmaxrees> what parent element exists on pageload?
[13:41:02] <robertmaxrees> .tabs?
[13:41:05] <robertparkerx> yes
[13:41:35] <robertmaxrees> so you want to use a delegated listener here.  check out https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:41:47] <robertmaxrees> (make sure you actually read 'em and don't just skip to the examples ;) )
[13:41:55] <robertparkerx> Okay
[13:41:58] <robertparkerx> Let me read these
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx lemme know if you get stuck :)
[14:03:22] <robertparkerx> ok
[14:03:42] <robertmaxrees> didja get it working?
[14:05:40] <robertparkerx> I haven't tried yet
[14:05:44] <robertparkerx> I'm still reading
[14:06:30] <robertmaxrees> oh.  alrighty :)
[14:11:39] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i was only saying to read this: https://i.imgur.com/6AKBZGf.png
[14:11:51] <robertmaxrees> not the entire event handler documentation page.
[14:12:28] <robertparkerx> LMAO
[14:12:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:12:40] <robertmaxrees> gonna guess you were reading the whole page?
[14:12:52] <robertparkerx> I'm not answering that question...
[14:12:56] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:13:05] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, just the bit about event delegation.
[14:15:28] <robertparkerx> I'm going to try it. I think I know enough for my use case.
[14:20:46] <robertmaxrees> :) should be pretty simple and straightforward.
[14:32:28] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx you get it figured out?
[14:32:35] <robertparkerx> I think so
[14:32:56] <robertmaxrees> rad.  feel free to show the code if you want another set of eyes.
[14:33:26] <robertparkerx> I'm trying to figure out this 500 error right now
[14:33:39] <robertmaxrees> ah gotcha :)
[14:33:41] <robertparkerx> My snippet worked on two other sites but not this one
[14:34:33] <robertmaxrees> not sure what that means buuuut alrighty.
[15:08:54] <robertparkerx> My append is not working as expected. My response is correct. $(this).closest('.tab').find('.inner').append(response);
[15:09:11] <robertparkerx> It works for finding the exclude_ids
[15:09:21] <robertmaxrees> can you be more specific about "not working"?
[15:09:57] <robertparkerx> well I don't see it appending anything in the DOM at all
[15:10:04] <robertparkerx> the response is right though
[15:10:17] <robertmaxrees> ok.  so what's the response?
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> share that code in context - i have a hunch what it is.
[15:10:55] <robertparkerx> okay
[15:11:36] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/38
[15:11:47] <robertmaxrees> the js i mean.
[15:11:51] <robertparkerx> oh
[15:12:04] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/39
[15:12:20] <robertmaxrees> that's why - $(this) isn't what you think it is inside of the ajax call.
[15:12:28] <robertmaxrees> the context changes in that callback.
[15:12:36] <robertparkerx> how can I capture it
[15:12:39] <robertparkerx> to use
[15:12:49] <robertparkerx> set before ?
[15:13:13] <robertparkerx> let _this = $(this);
[15:13:16] <robertmaxrees> slow downb
[15:13:18] <robertmaxrees> let me type lol
[15:13:26] <robertparkerx> Sorry
[15:13:34] <MassDebates> Oh my god, I thought robertparkerx was going insane
[15:13:43] <MassDebates> "WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO!?"
[15:14:12] <robertparkerx> haha
[15:14:27] <robertmaxrees> you need to either bind the callback, use an arrow function, or save the 'this' object in a var.
[15:14:43] <robertparkerx> Okay
[15:14:45] <robertmaxrees> I'd go with the first or second option.
[15:16:11] <robertparkerx> Okay how do I use the first instance of what find get
[15:16:19] <robertparkerx> it's working now
[15:16:20] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:16:26] <robertparkerx> but it's posting to both .inner
[15:16:42] <robertmaxrees> oh - how do you get the first element in the collection?
[15:16:47] <robertparkerx> yes
[15:16:51] <robertparkerx> with the class
[15:17:12] <robertparkerx> [0] ?
[15:17:16] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/iyRb0bE.png
[15:17:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:17:25] <robertmaxrees> never use [0] on jquery objects.
[15:17:35] <MassDebates> Why not?
[15:17:52] <robertmaxrees> unless you need the underlying DOM object.
[15:18:24] <robertmaxrees> if you don't, then you wind up having to pass it back through the constructor.  so you wind up with code like $($('.foo')[0]);
[15:18:35] <MassDebates> Oh yuck
[15:18:39] <MassDebates> okay that's legit
[15:18:43] <robertmaxrees> just use .first() or, even better, fix your markup to use more semantic classnames.
[15:19:07] <robertmaxrees> if you're relying on some kind of implicit "position" in the doucmnent, you're gonna wind up with real neat bugs later.
[15:24:48] <robertparkerx> yea it was easier just to fix my class name
[15:24:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:24:59] <robertmaxrees> or add a classname.
[15:25:16] <robertparkerx> +1
[15:25:50] <robertparkerx> Well all of it is working as expected now
[15:25:56] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[15:26:06] <robertparkerx> tyvm
[15:26:17] <robertparkerx> I learned quit a lot
[15:26:20] <robertmaxrees> def.  what we're here for.
[15:26:25] <robertparkerx> I have one question, does first go down?
[15:26:33] <robertparkerx> .first()
[15:26:49] <MassDebates> in the DOM? yes but you can reverse it
[15:26:52] <MassDebates> HEY I KNEW A THING!
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> "down"?
[15:27:02] <robertmaxrees> as opposed to what?
[15:27:07] <MassDebates> He means traversing throguh the dom, as opposed to upwards
[15:27:11] <robertparkerx> yes
[15:27:17] <MassDebates> like
[15:27:17] <robertmaxrees> there's not "traversing" in this case though.
[15:27:22] <MassDebates> well I mean
[15:27:24] <MassDebates> gar
[15:27:32] <MassDebates> I mean the looking and the feeling and the grabby grabby
[15:27:32] <robertmaxrees> you have a collection of elements.  the first element in the collection is the first one that appears in the dom.
[15:28:47] <MassDebates> <div class="container that is indexed"><p>This is first, which is 'higher' than second.</p><p>This is second, which is lower than first and higher than third.</p><p>This is third</p> <style>.container.that.is.indexed. p {color: red;}</style>
[15:29:01] <MassDebates> running .first() and then running a new color would change the P containing "this is first"
[15:29:09] <MassDebates> because first goes from top-down
[15:29:35] <MassDebates> By "down" he means as if each new sibling tag shows up on the next line below the current line of the current tag
[15:29:41] <robertmaxrees> my point is "top-down" is confusing here since "top-down" implies ancestor-descendent.
[15:29:53] <MassDebates> Right yeah I get that
[15:29:59] <robertmaxrees> whereas those <p> tags are siblings.
[15:30:04] <MassDebates> Yeah
[15:30:18] <MassDebates> I get that the question was errant
[15:31:25] <robertmaxrees> :) it may seem pedantic, but helping folks get their brain around terminology helps them out in the future.
[15:31:49] <robertparkerx> I agree
[15:32:39] <MassDebates> I understand. I was just trying to help coalesce and be helpful
[15:32:56] <robertparkerx> You are :D
[15:32:57] <robertmaxrees> oh totally - it's appreciated.  providing a little coaching for ya, that's all :)
[18:19:49] <robertparkerx> is it easy to do tabs with show/hide? hide the main class and show for the second specific ?
[18:20:07] <robertparkerx> on click
[18:20:08] <robertmaxrees> kind of?
[18:20:23] <robertmaxrees> though i wouldn't use show/hide for that.
[18:20:36] <robertparkerx> What would you use?
[18:20:54] <robertmaxrees> i would use addClass and removeClass and define a class to handle that work for me.
[18:21:06] <robertmaxrees> alternatively: are you using any frontent frameworks?
[18:21:07] <robertparkerx> Ahh
[18:21:10] <robertparkerx> no
[18:21:13] <robertmaxrees> *frontend
[18:21:15] <robertparkerx> This site doesn't have any
[18:21:33] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, do the heavy lifting yourself in that case - show/hide is great until it wigs out on an edge case :)
[18:21:52] <robertparkerx> I'll use addClass/removeClass
[18:40:04] <robertparkerx> yeah this is much smoother
[18:40:07] <robertparkerx> I'll rememver it
[18:40:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
