[00:05:55] <Cork> blindMoe: easing is built in, but not all the effects
[00:06:11] <blindMoe> k so the easing plugin is still needed essentially?
[00:06:21] <Cork> depends
[00:06:23] <Cork> but possibly
[00:06:39] <Cork> also you might want to look into css transition
[00:12:26] <blindMoe> Cork: thanks for the info
[00:12:55] <Cork> blindMoe: for me i've stopped using js animations for bascailly everything
[00:13:14] <Cork> except dynamic element height (as css doesn't support that)
[00:13:30] <blindMoe> Cork: yeah I use CSS transitions for sites but this is for a module I support that other people install so I need to offer both unfortunately
[00:13:55] <Cork> blindMoe: animations is normally no vital enough to need a fallback
[00:14:09] <Cork> as it is mostly just eye candy
[00:14:12] <blindMoe> this is for a stage slider so it is needed
[00:14:18] <blindMoe> otherwise I wouldn't worry about it
[00:37:44] <greek> Hi all. I'm trying to get the most recent / nearest occurrence of a class before a certain object whose selector I know.
[00:38:11] <Cork> greek: dom doesn't really work like that
[00:38:23] <Cork> it is a tree structure
[00:38:35] <Cork> you can look for siblings or a child of a parent
[00:38:42] <Cork> but not a generic "closest"
[00:39:40] <greek> Cork, ok thanks. I can reference it's last sibling and the element I want is the last element in that sibling. Is that possible?
[00:39:41] <Cork> greek: if you explain what you're trying to do it might be possible to find another way to do it though
[00:40:23] <greek> I have a div (container) with multiple inputs, then a save button, then another div container and a save button, and so. When I click the save button, I want to know the last element in the last div just before the save button.
[00:40:29] <Cork> siblings().last().last()
[00:40:36] <Cork> hmm wait no
[00:40:39] <Cork> siblings().last().children().last()
[00:40:54] <greek> Thanks I'll give that a go
[00:41:07] <kk1> has anyone used jquery.dForm
[00:41:44] <Cork> greek: so $(this).prev('div').children().last() sounds like what you're looking for
[00:42:07] <Cork> opps
[00:42:18] <Cork> *$(this).prevAll('div').first().children().last() sounds like what you're looking for
[00:44:26] <greek> Cork, neat! That second one worked. Thanks!
[01:10:28] <zkanda> Hi I'm using ui autocomplete, but I want to change the behavior. I'm querying a list of airport using ajax, what I want is if I type a place for example "Paris" It would include all airport within in the dropdown.
[01:11:15] <Cork> zkanda: that kind of filter is normally done server side
[01:11:20] <Cork> by a query
[01:13:09] <zkanda> Hi Cork , It's already returning the other airport within paris. It just won't show in the dropdown.
[01:13:40] <Cork> zkanda: might be you're not returning the json format autocomplete expects
[01:13:47] <Cork> create a fiddle with the code you're using
[01:13:55] <Cork> (and an example of the json you send back)
[01:14:08] <zkanda> Ok wait.
[01:24:57] <zkanda> Cork: Here http://jsfiddle.net/4xp7o58k/ in the airports is dynamically created. But in that case, if I type Paris, It would only display Parisâ€“Le Bourget Airport ,
[01:27:34] <Cork> zkanda: so basically something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/4xp7o58k/2/
[01:27:46] <Cork> (the function is to emulate source: 'url',
[01:27:48] <Cork> ()
[01:28:27] <Cork> zkanda: is the server sending the correct Content-Type header?
[01:29:28] <zkanda> Cork: That's exactly what I'm looking for. Wow, that was very fast. I'm returning, 'application/json' from the server.
[01:29:38] <zkanda> is that correct?
[01:29:42] <Cork> yes
[01:29:57] <Cork> so it sounds like this should work
[01:30:30] <Cork> zkanda: and the server looks for ?term= for the search?
[01:30:32] <zkanda> Cork: Yeah, sorry I suck at JS, haha Thank you very much..
[01:31:04] <zkanda> Cork: Yes.. It's returning what I like to query.
[01:31:11] <Cork> if yes then just do source: '/url/for/search.php',
[01:31:19] <Cork> and it should work out of the box
[01:31:33] <Cork> the function isn't needed
[01:31:44] <Cork> for some reference http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[01:32:56] <zkanda> Cork: Oh, much neater.. Cool. haha great.
[01:38:42] <lacrymology> hello, I'm trying to use jquery-ui's sortable, and I notice it doesn't seem to work on mobile. I've come into this little hack that makes it work https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch but I'm seeing 4-year-old forum posts and issues that hint that this should be supported already, so.. is there a more "official" way to support drag-and-drop on mobile browsers?
[01:38:44] <davlefou> zkanda, FranÃ§ais?
[01:40:10] <Cork> lacrymology: as far as i know no jquery ui doesn't support touch
[01:40:21] <Cork> (by default)
[01:40:30] <davlefou> Hi, i how i add new entry in select?
[01:40:36] <Cork> and i've used it much closer then four years ago
[01:40:53] <Cork> last i fiddled with touch in ui is ~ 2 years ago
[01:41:24] <Cork> davlefou: append/prepend/insertAfter/instertBefore a <option> element
[01:41:31] <Cork> *an
[01:41:48] <zkanda> davlefou: Nah, my boss is. :)
[01:42:13] <Cork> opps append/prepend/after/before
[01:42:22] <Cork> insertBefore/insertAfter is the other direction
[01:44:08] <davlefou> zkanda, Dommage!
[01:45:10] <zkanda> davlefou: not really. :)
[01:45:45] <davlefou> Cork, there are not tools to manage select? (http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp)
[01:45:53] <lacrymology> Cork: and what did you use?
[01:45:59] <Cork> ugg
[01:46:12] <Cork> davlefou: don't use w3schools
[01:46:27] <Cork> actually do -site:w3schools.com every time you search the net...

[01:48:58] <kk1> hi i wd like to extend jquery plugin but it does not seems to work, here i am using dform plugin
[01:49:38] <davlefou> Cork, it only to be ok about your answers.
[01:49:53] <kk1> Cork:http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=OpE5O5iTTc
[01:50:04] <kk1> Cork: hi i wd like to extend jquery plugin but it does not seems to work, here i am using dform plugin
[01:53:37] <kk1> Crok: any help?
[01:53:56] <kk1> *Cork : any help
[01:54:27] <Cork> kk1: i don't know the plugin, and you haven't asked a question i can act on
[02:00:14] <lacrymology> davlefou: what do you want to do with a select, exactly? I mean, why do you think you need special functions to do it>
[02:00:30] <Horacsio> hi I'm using validate plugin with this form of mine but I need it to NOT refresh or redirect to a new page so I'm adding an ajax part resolve it. yet the ajax overrides the validations. I need to check if valid then ajax. can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/v667fys0/1/
[02:00:39] <kk1> Cork: do not worry about the plugin, https://github.com/daffl/jquery.dform...all i asked was how would one go about extending it?
[02:00:49] <lacrymology> anything that $('select[name="foo"]').more-stuff() won't solve?
[02:01:06] <Cork> kk1: there isn't a generic answer
[02:01:13] <Cork> only a specific one
[02:01:21] <Cork> as you can't really extend a plugin generically
[02:01:37] <Cork> it depends on if the plugin is at all written to support extensions
[02:01:54] <Cork> or in what method you are meant to extend it if it is supported
[02:02:07] <davlefou> lacrymology, i want to add or remove entry.
[02:02:22] <kk1> Cork: ok
[02:02:25] <Cork> davlefou: what is wrong with .append ?
[02:02:29] <Cork> or .remove()
[02:03:01] <lacrymology> davlefou: .append() and .remove()?
[02:03:03] <lacrymology> ah, yes
[02:03:21] <Cork> sure you can wrap that one command in a plugin if you want
[02:03:26] <Cork> but i really don't see the point
[02:05:44] <gurke_> hi@all :)
[02:06:19] <davlefou> lacrymology, that is an idea
[02:09:25] <Horacsio> anyone please?
[02:10:14] <Cork> Horacsio: don't use click
[02:10:17] <Cork> use submit on the form
[02:10:27] <Cork> then you should get the effect you're after
[02:12:06] <Horacsio> Cork: but is the if statment correct?
[02:12:30] <Cork> Horacsio: if biasform.valid(); { <-- this isn't valid js
[02:12:35] <Cork> Horacsio: if (biasform.valid()) { <-- this isn't valid js
[02:12:39] <Cork> opps
[02:12:45] <Cork> Horacsio: if (biasform.valid()) { <-- this is how it should be
[02:13:22] <Horacsio> ok let me recheck all then. thank you ;)
[02:15:11] <Horacsio> I'm using submit already :)
[02:41:33] <Horacsio> Please could someone help me with the if statement: http://jsfiddle.net/v667fys0/2/
[02:42:11] <Horacsio> it stills send the form even if the requiered fields are empty...
[02:44:40] <Cork> Horacsio: your doing the validation on page load
[02:44:46] <Cork> not on submit
[02:44:54] <Cork> so how would it prevent the form from sending?
[02:45:28] <Cork> 1. page loads, 2. validate form, 3. if form is valid bind a submit event handler on the form
[02:45:38] <Cork> 4. submit is clicked, 5. ajax is called
[02:46:06] <Cork> 2 and 3 should be after 4 not before
[02:53:22] <Horacsio> Cork: could you be a bit more specific on this please?
[02:53:47] <Cork> Horacsio: if you want to validate the form as it is about to be submited
[02:53:55] <Cork> you need to validate the form as it is about to be submited
[02:54:01] <Cork> and not when the page is loading
[02:54:16] <Cork> as you're currently doing
[02:56:34] <Horacsio> Cork: how do I prevent from the to do it on page loading? :S
[02:57:33] <Horacsio> Cork I've updated the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/v667fys0/3/
[02:57:46] <lemonsparrow> I have a loader screen that runs during any ajax call and once the ajax call is complete.. the loader closes… I want to know how can I disable the page during loader.. meaning not allow user to click on any hyperlinks or button.. thanks
[02:58:25] <Cork> Horacsio: line 14 and 15
[02:59:40] <Cork> Horacsio: right now; one page load you run validate (line 12) and if the form is valid (line 14) bind a submit event without any validation checks line 15)
[02:59:46] <Cork> and all it does is call ajax
[03:00:30] <Cork> meaning right now if the form isn't valid on page load do a normal http submit
[03:00:37] <Cork> and if it is valid on page load do an ajax
[03:00:42] <Cork> that is what the code does
[03:01:25] <Horacsio> but line 12 checks for validation, calls the validate plugin and check for empty fields
[03:01:34] <Cork> on page load yes
[03:01:37] <Cork> not on submit
[03:01:53] <Cork> meaning what is inside the if statement happens on pageload
[03:02:03] <Horacsio> then the idea was to check if the form is valid()
[03:02:03] <Cork> so if the form on load isn't valid you don't bind a submit handler
[03:04:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork, any idea on my query..
[03:04:26] <lemonsparrow> I have a loader screen that runs during any ajax call and once the ajax call is complete.. the loader closes… I want to know how can I disable the page during loader.. meaning not allow user to click on any hyperlinks or button.. thanks
[03:04:56] <Horacsio> Cork I don't know how to manage what you're talking about :(
[03:04:57] <Cork> lemonsparrow: put a cover screen over the page
[03:05:07] <lemonsparrow> Cork,  how
[03:05:09] <Cork> Horacsio: uh, move the check into the submit event?
[03:05:40] <Legie> hi, can anybody help me with this easy jquery stuff? http://mojemisto.wz.cz/  - second map didnt show but it works when you put it on single page
[03:05:43] <Legie> code is here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8d0074ea73eceeb08528
[03:05:51] <Legie> where can be problem?
[03:05:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: <div class="cover"></div> css: .cover { position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: <something to give a hue>; }
[03:06:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: jquery ui has an example you might want to check
[03:07:09] <red> Legie: works for me
[03:07:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork, thanks
[03:07:27] <red> MAP1 and MAP2 both load a different map for me
[03:07:46] <red> or do you mean that the location on fhte map is fubar?
[03:08:23] <Horacsio> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/v667fys0/4/ it seems ok now :)
[03:08:43] <Cork> Horacsio: you most likely want to move 12 in there too
[03:08:49] <Cork> line 12 that is
[03:08:56] <Horacsio> I think I got the idea
[03:09:33] <Horacsio> but that way is working, why I should move 12 too?
[03:10:02] <red> Legie: in any case, if the location is wrong, try loading the iframe AFTER you show it
[03:10:14] <red> so basicly put the src="" of the iframe into data-src=""
[03:10:44] <red> and after your .show(), grab the src with .attr("data-src") and put it into the .src
[03:10:53] <red> that way the map only gets loaded if it gets shown
[03:11:13] <red> put it into the src="" *
[03:15:12] <Adamski2600> Would someone be able to point me in the right direction with toggling an animation inside a scroll function? I'm using slideUp/Down which seems to be working fine, but animate seems to be firing at random points..
[03:15:33] <prohobo> hey, anyone know how to use jquery UI sliders to live update some element? i've added slide() and change() event handlers but the value isn't accurate until the user releases the mouse button
[03:15:38] <prohobo> its always 1 event behind...
[03:15:41] <red> Adamski2600: how does it fire on random point?
[03:16:02] <Cork> prohobo: use the ui argument in the function
[03:16:09] <Cork> and they should be accurate
[03:16:22] <red> there should be start, during drag and stop functions
[03:16:33] <red> @ prohobo
[03:16:49] <Cork> red: on sliders??
[03:16:55] <prohobo> so the same thing as $(this).slider('value') except ui.slider('value')?
[03:17:08] <red> Cork: the slider has change, create, slide, start and stop events
[03:17:18] <red> you can attach whatever into any of them
[03:17:34] <Legie> red: thanks iam going to try it!
[03:17:35] <Cork> prohobo: ui.values
[03:17:41] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-slide
[03:17:42] <prohobo> k ty cork
[03:17:54] <Adamski2600> red: I think it's my conditional. I'm basically saying if the top of the page is greater than a value then animate height to 100px, else animate to 20px. But it doesn't seem to be firing at the correct position on the page..
[03:18:21] <prohobo> nice, it works super sexy now
[03:18:35] <Cork> red: you don't need to bind the start or stop if you want to cat on the slider changing
[03:19:26] <red> Cork: ofcourse not, but I was just saying that there are multiple different things you can bind your stuff on, obviously "slide" is the logical one for him, but it's good to know it's not the only one :P
[03:19:32] <red> (only one that exists)
[04:09:49] <greengriminal> So i have a weird scenario where by i am trying to call the method hide() and it keeps saying i cannot call the method on null - http://postimg.org/image/hmxgn7myr/
[04:10:11] <greengriminal> I understand what EXACTLY the error is saying i just don't get why in my screenshot at that specific moment i have the id.
[04:10:39] <Cork> greengriminal: doesn't sounds like the object is jquery then
[04:10:58] <greengriminal> Cork: But you can see clearly i have the id right
[04:11:13] <greengriminal> but then hitting continue it's as though i must lose the reference to the id or something.
[04:11:18] <Cork> ya but $('q') isn't a way to select ids in jquery
[04:11:24] <Cork> your prob using prototype
[04:11:36] <Cork> and then yes you need to do a lot of if checks in prototype
[04:11:53] <Horacsio> Adamski2600: I've never seen some adamski adept :D
[04:12:02] <greengriminal> Cork: Right okay.
[04:12:43] <greengriminal> Cork: so your saying if it was jQuery it would be $('#q').hide();
[04:12:58] <Cork> greengriminal: yes, AND the error you have wouldn't happen
[04:13:14] <Cork> $() in jquery always return an object
[04:13:20] <Cork> so you can't get the error you have
[04:14:29] <greengriminal> right okay.
[04:14:31] <greengriminal> Thanks.

[05:38:43] <Carty> hey, does anybody know any good, easy to use JQuery (or JavaScript) sliders?  I currently have Nivo Slider but saw JSSor and it looks really cool.  I just wondered if anyone has used it or if they know anything better.
[05:47:18] <Cork> Carty: by slider do you mean a slider or a slideshow?
[05:48:21] <Carty> Cork: I'm going to point you here: http://demo.dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/  and here: http://www.jssor.com/demos/
[05:48:35] <Carty> I don't quite now, I think I mean slider
[05:48:37] <Cork> so a slideshow
[05:48:52] <Cork> ?g jquery.com slider
[05:48:53] <b-ot> Cork: Slider | jQuery UI â†’ http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[05:48:57] <Cork> that is a slider
[05:49:06] <Cork> (and there is one in the html form spec)
[05:49:23] <Cork> but yes many slideshows wrongly call them self a slider
[05:49:42] <Cork> and causes a lot of misunderstanding cause of it
[05:49:58] <Carty> ah, ok
[05:50:37] <Carty> oh, yeah I didn't mean like a slider bar thing, I meant image slider.  I should have made that clear
[05:50:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork, can I have a bind unbind function to disable clicks on the page ?
[05:50:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: sure
[05:51:11] <Cork> lemonsparrow: though removing event listeners to handle logic is normally a bad way to go about things
[05:52:12] <lemonsparrow> Cork, I will add it inside my ajax loader function.. that way it will be easier… and in the loader complete method.. I will add the unbind method
[05:52:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork, how will be the code for .bind be like to disable click
[05:52:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ugg...
[05:52:42] <Cork> lemonsparrow: $('target').unbind('click')
[05:52:51] <Cork> and bind is like when you first attached it
[05:53:06] <Cork> lemonsparrow: didn't the cover screen work?
[05:53:25] <lemonsparrow> Cork, I didnt understand the code...
[05:53:32] <Cork> ok, one min
[05:53:34] <lemonsparrow> Cork, its something to do with css to right ?
[05:53:39] <Cork> yes
[05:55:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork, https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/f985f0eae7f0c1245c44 line 15 and line 38 i where I need to add the disable part
[05:56:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork, not just disable click but kinda give a freeze screen.. if you get what I mean..
[05:56:20] <lemonsparrow> Cork, please help me add my logic to that code
[05:56:32] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/nn0yxLbq/
[05:57:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: why would you want to frees the screen??
[05:57:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok not freeze but disable all actions basically.. click events..
[05:57:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork, can you show me in my code how to achieve that?
[05:57:56] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the fiddle i gave you will block all mouse events
[05:58:10] <Cork> keyboard events can still happen though
[05:58:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork, it changes the background color … I don want that
[05:58:35] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you will have to have some color, not much
[05:58:43] <Cork> else ie will ignore the cover
[05:59:07] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok… can I achieve the same with simple bind unbind for all click events ?
[05:59:22] <Cork> lemonsparrow: not really
[05:59:29] <Cork> 1. it won't prevent normal actions
[05:59:44] <Cork> 2. you will have to know all event handlers that existed and recreate them
[06:00:06] <lemonsparrow> all I want to disable is click events.. thats all
[06:00:16] <Cork> you can't really disable events
[06:00:23] <Cork> unless you add a check in every event handler
[06:00:29] <tangorri> I can't make draggable containment works ... /
[06:00:50] <Cork> lemonsparrow: also unbind won't prevent normal a tags from working
[06:01:12] <lemonsparrow> tags ?
[06:01:19] <Cork> <a> <-- a tag
[06:01:26] <n3ssi3> Hi I'm having a bug with jQuery.Toggle... I am using jQuery 1.8.3 and jQuery Ui 1.7.1 .... jQuery 1.8 actually supports .toggle(true) but in my case toggle gets overwritten by jQuery Ui, which does not support ShowOrHide... As far as I can see this is not fixed in a newer jQuery UI release. Am I doing something wrong, or why does jQuery UI overwrite
[06:01:26] <n3ssi3> jQuery.toggle and not accept the same arguments ?
[06:01:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok
[06:02:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork, is it possible to replicate your code without making css file change.. adding class from query itself ?
[06:03:10] <Cork> n3ssi3: looks correct ya
[06:03:17] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/toggle/
[06:03:40] <Cork> lemonsparrow: uh... sure but why?
[06:03:50] <Cork> styles belong in the css file
[06:03:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork, I don't want to make changes to css as of now..
[06:04:00] <Cork> O_o'
[06:04:05] <Cork> why??
[06:05:05] <Cork> lemonsparrow: having css in the js file, even though it is possible, is a huge pain in maintainability for the site
[06:05:23] <Cork> it makes keeping the site working much much harder later on
[06:05:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok
[06:05:36] <n3ssi3> Cork: :( so I have to change my toggle to show and hide, there is no nicer solution then ? :S
[06:05:52] <Cork> n3ssi3: you could use toggleClass?
[06:06:16] <Cork> n3ssi3: but ya, this looks like a bug
[06:06:27] <Cork> check so there is a bug on file for that
[06:06:34] <Cork> if not file it
[06:06:46] <n3ssi3> this does not support true or false at all :p but thanks I will change it to show and hide
[06:06:52] <n3ssi3> Cork: thanks I will
[06:07:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork, also $('button').on('click', function() {
[06:07:00] <lemonsparrow>     $('#cover').addClass('active');
[06:07:06] <Cork> n3ssi3: uh file a bug for jquery-ui
[06:07:06] <lemonsparrow> here we are attaching it to a button
[06:07:21] <Cork> n3ssi3: well make sure there is one reported, and if not make a report
[06:07:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork, in my case I want to enable this when the loader runs
[06:07:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork, https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/f985f0eae7f0c1245c44
[06:07:39] <lemonsparrow> Cork, which part of my code do I add that ?
[06:07:50] <Cork> lemonsparrow: addClass('active') and removeClass('active')
[06:07:53] <Cork> is what you care about
[06:07:59] <Cork> the rest is just for the demo
[06:08:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok.. so what do I add that class to ?
[06:08:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork, can u tell me from my code ?
[06:08:55] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the cover element
[06:09:13] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i gave you a demo, you should be able to figure it out from there
[06:09:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork, in my case cover is container.. I guess
[06:09:27] <Cork> no
[06:09:44] <Cork> check the demo, and actually try to understand the code
[06:11:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork, in ur case its div id… but in my case i want the whole page to be disabled
[06:12:07] <Cork> lemonsparrow: again check the demo
[06:12:20] <Cork> cause no, it is not just parts of the page
[06:13:46] <lemonsparrow> cork so what will be my cover ?
[06:13:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork, I am not getting
[06:14:42] <Cork> lemonsparrow: uh..., do you know how css works at all?
[06:15:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork, is it the ajax-status div in my case ?
[06:16:04] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i have no clue
[06:16:14] <Cork> as i can't see what the page looks like or anything
[06:16:25] <Cork> but you should have what you need
[06:20:49] <lemonsparrow> Cork, what if I did $('body').addClass(newClass);
[06:20:59] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it won't do anything
[06:21:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork, I want to make this generic.. like when loader runs.. disable all click events in page
[06:21:32] <lemonsparrow> :(
[06:21:49] <Cork> lemonsparrow: again you can't do that
[06:21:59] <Cork> like i've told you and why several times now
[06:24:08] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok how about have the css classes in the css.. but adding the cover element dynamically and then attaching active class to it ?
[06:25:42] <tangorri> how can I stop drop event bubbling please ?
[06:27:15] <Cork> lemonsparrow: sure you can add the element dynamically if you like
[06:27:33] <Cork> tangorri: stopPropagation?
[06:27:46] <tangorri> Cork : doesn't work
[06:27:54] <Cork> heh... nice...
[06:27:59] <Cork> no clue then
[06:28:02] <lemonsparrow> 				$( "<div id="cover"></div>" ).insertAfter( "#ajax-status" );
[06:28:02] <lemonsparrow> 				$('#cover').addClass('active');
[06:28:03] <tangorri> somone ?
[06:28:08] <tangorri> somEone
[06:28:27] <wa5ted> lemonsparrow: no code
[06:28:29] <wa5ted> in chat
[06:28:31] <wa5ted> really?
[06:28:39] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.com
[06:28:42] <wa5ted> http://jsfiddle.net
[06:28:44] <wa5ted> ^
[06:28:56] <Cork> wa5ted: he's trying to implement a demo i gave him a while back
[06:29:08] <wa5ted> Cork: stilll no ecuse to use a pastie
[06:29:09] <Cork> but please guide him, i don't have the strength
[06:29:17] <wa5ted> Cork: what di you mean
[06:29:21] <wa5ted> guide him
[06:29:24] <wa5ted> you dont ahve the strength
[06:29:48] <Cork> wa5ted: he wants to do this http://jsfiddle.net/nn0yxLbq/
[06:29:59] <Cork> but don't understand the demo
[06:30:16] <wa5ted> Cork: niether do i without context
[06:30:50] <Cork> wa5ted: he wants to prevent links and click events from being used by the user while he does an ajax call
[06:31:07] <wa5ted> not that hard
[06:31:09] <Cork> ya
[06:31:12] <wa5ted> when he makes the ajax call
[06:31:23] <wa5ted> add aclass to an element
[06:31:29] <wa5ted> and when a click event is fired wheck if that class exists
[06:31:33] <wa5ted> whats so hard
[06:31:40] <wa5ted> lemonsparrow: care to chime in?
[06:31:48] <Cork> wa5ted: if you mean check for the class you would have to modify every event handler
[06:31:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork, works fine :)
[06:31:54] <lemonsparrow> thanks a lot
[06:32:06] <wa5ted> Cork: i solved the issue
[06:32:08] <wa5ted> :)
[06:33:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork, my only concern is that it changes the color of few elements in UI
[06:34:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so set background-color: rgba(255,255,255, .1);
[06:34:56] <Cork> lemonsparrow: though disabling the page without no visible queue for the user is bad ux
[06:35:27] <aro> is there a way to find a json object by dot notation in jquery?
[06:35:50] <Cork> aro: what?
[06:35:52] <aro> like say, this element is at: obj.data.engine.torque
[06:36:09] <aro> im trying to find a sane way to gather 'ranges' of certain json elements
[06:36:14] <Cork> so you want to recursively search through the objects?
[06:36:17] <aro> and it seems like the most logical way is to define their location
[06:36:24] <aro> Cork: yes, but they may be at varying depths
[06:36:39] <handoyo> hi all,i would like to ask.Isnit possible to add click event for the checkbox within jquery ui dialog?
[06:36:41] <lemonsparrow> rgba(255,255,255, .1); and rgba(0,0,0,.1); didn't make any change ?
[06:36:46] <Cork> aro: that is where the recursive comes in
[06:36:58] <aro> how would i do that?
[06:37:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: one should be black and the other white
[06:37:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok in my case I didn't find any change in the page background :)
[06:37:55] <Cork> aro: you would have you loop the keys of the object check if the keys value is what you're looking for, if it isn't and it is an object call the function again to go into the object (recursive)
[06:38:26] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/nn0yxLbq/4/
[06:38:30] <aro> right, i understand that concept - but there are various keys of the same value
[06:38:36] <aro> same key rather
[06:38:39] <aro> same key name
[06:38:44] <aro> but they may have different parent keys
[06:38:55] <Cork> aro: objects can't have multiple keys with the same name
[06:39:11] <Cork> you need to use arrays if you want to store things like that
[06:39:58] <aro> pastebin.com/zuQEHhzZ
[06:40:00] <aro> look at that
[06:40:08] <aro> maybe you will see it differently than i do
[06:40:35] <Cork> aro: what do you want to look at?
[06:40:44] <Cork> meaning what value do you want out?
[06:41:00] <aro> i want to define a given set of 'paths' like engineTorque
[06:41:06] <aro> which would be at data.engine.torque
[06:41:16] <aro> or engineType - data.engineType
[06:41:39] <Cork> well torque is multiple values
[06:41:47] <Cork> you mean it should be the object?
[06:41:51] <aro> yes
[06:41:55] <Cork> ok
[06:42:15] <Cork> so you want to recursively look through the tree for a key with the matching name?
[06:42:22] <aro> I am just defining some ranges and i need to iterate those specified paths
[06:42:23] <aro> yes
[06:45:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork, in fiddle when I click, there is no color change
[06:46:52] <tangorri> ok really drop event.stopPropagation doesn't work on jQuery
[06:47:19] <tangorri> should I make a ticket ?
[06:48:13] <Cork> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/ej02q4nr/
[06:48:42] <Cork> tangorri: stopPropagation works on jquery
[06:49:00] <Cork> tangorri: though native events doesn't work cleanly with jquery events
[06:49:28] <Cork> cause jquery handles events out of the native event order
[06:49:41] <Cork> seen from native events i mean
[06:49:49] <Cork> in jquery events everything is in order
[06:50:30] <Cork> aro?
[06:50:49] <tangorri> well it doens't stop it, using a flag actually
[06:50:50] <aro> im looking
[06:51:35] <Cork> tangorri: well are you sure the problem is with jquery and not how the browser treats stopPropagation for drop events?
[06:51:36] <aro> if u use 'gasoline' it doesnt produce the needed results
[06:51:54] <Cork> ya it returns the first match
[06:51:59] <tangorri> Cork : yes :)
[06:52:20] <Cork> aro: so you need an array if there are multiple keys matching?
[06:52:31] <aro> ok
[06:52:53] <Cork> aro: is that a yes or no?
[06:53:07] <aro> i mean, yeah if i have to ill have to do that
[06:54:08] <krambiorix> hi, how can i validate a decimal like XXX.XXX,XX -> the dot as thousand separator is optional, the comma also optional but if there's a comma there should be a digit before it...
[06:54:25] <lemonsparrow> Cork, …. is there a neater way to write this ?
[06:54:26] <lemonsparrow> 				$( "<div id='cover'></div>" ).insertAfter( "#ajax-status" );
[06:54:26] <lemonsparrow> 				$('#cover').addClass('active');
[06:55:29] <Cork> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/ej02q4nr/1/
[06:55:45] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you don't need the active class
[06:56:02] <Cork> that was to handle the logic you put in js by css
[06:56:12] <Cork> just remove the display css and it should work without it
[06:56:16] <aro> ok
[06:56:19] <aro> ill try that
[06:56:37] <Cork> aro: note the type mismatch you get
[06:56:40] <Cork> (the true value)
[06:57:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork, so what will $('#cover').addClass('active'); become ?
[06:57:17] <Cork> nothing
[06:57:21] <Cork> just remove it
[06:57:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork, you mean remove that line and keep only $( "<div id='cover'></div>" ).insertAfter( "#ajax-status" ); ?
[06:58:12] <Cork> yes
[06:58:31] <krambiorix> anyone?
[06:58:31] <lemonsparrow> but I need both
[06:58:32] <lemonsparrow> #cover {display: none;position: fixed;top: 0;left: 0;right: 0;bottom: 0;background-color: rgba(255,255,255, .1);}
[06:58:32] <lemonsparrow> #cover.active {display: block;}
[06:58:36] <lemonsparrow> right ?
[06:58:42] <Cork> no
[06:58:45] <Cork> ...
[06:58:55] <wa5ted> lemonsparrow: if you paste code any more in here
[06:58:57] <Cork> lemonsparrow: please try to understand the code instead of just copying it
[06:58:58] <wa5ted> i will get you banned
[06:59:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork, please correct me
[07:00:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork, got it removed display: none; from #cover and it worked..
[07:01:00] <Cork> ...
[07:01:06] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and you have no clue why right?
[07:01:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork, so to disable.. should I remove the element from cover div ?
[07:01:57] <lemonsparrow> Cork, no I don't but I would like to learn from you how.. I mean a small simple explanation would do.
[07:05:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork, please give a small explanation
[07:08:08] <krambiorix> can anyone show me how to validate a euro currency ? XX.XXX,XX ?
[07:18:33] <Cork> krambiorix: you're looking for a regex for that you mean?
[07:19:33] <Cork> decimal separator and thousand separator depends on country, not currency
[07:20:43] <krambiorix> Cork, i try with this but doesn't seem to work ... http://jsfiddle.net/ThedonSolo/oL03f9vd/
[07:21:09] <Cork> wow...
[07:21:58] <Cork> krambiorix: why not just /-?[0-9.]+(,[0-9]+)?/
[07:22:49] <krambiorix> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/ThedonSolo/oL03f9vd/1/
[07:22:50] <Cork> or do you mean you have to check that the number is in groups of three?
[07:25:05] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/oL03f9vd/2/
[07:25:29] <Cork> i think your logic was a bit confused
[07:26:25] <krambiorix> Cork,  i want to check if, if it's a decimal, the separator is a comma and there is a digit before the comma X,00
[07:27:00] <krambiorix> Cork,  but your fiddle does that :) thanks a lot!!
[07:27:07] <Cork> lol
[07:27:14] <Cork> you made me look XD
[07:27:23] <Cork> [0-9.]+ <-- this does that
[07:27:36] <Cork> though it will allow .,00
[07:28:00] <krambiorix> hmm
[07:28:16] <Cork> so the question is if you need to protect for that
[07:28:22] <krambiorix> yeah
[07:28:30] <Cork> that makes things harder
[07:28:41] <krambiorix> there should be minimum one digit in before the comma :s
[07:29:27] <krambiorix> Cork, 0,50 doesn't validate with your code ...
[07:30:48] <Cork> krambiorix: works fine here
[07:31:31] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/oL03f9vd/4/
[07:31:39] <Cork> that should solve the .,00 problem
[07:31:56] <Cork> opps
[07:32:00] <Cork> the plus shouldn't be there
[07:32:06] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/oL03f9vd/5/
[07:34:36] <Cork> krambiorix: and a much stricter one http://jsfiddle.net/oL03f9vd/6/
[07:35:10] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks a lot man!!!
[07:35:12] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/oL03f9vd/7/ <-- fixed decimal validator
[07:35:50] <Cork> krambiorix: np
[07:39:25] <xxx1337> if i have a contact form and i need to add validation do i add validation on all fields or only the ones that are required
[07:39:27] <xxx1337> ?
[07:46:33] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: you add validation to all the fields you want to validate.
[07:46:56] <decx> well i add validation to the form and not individual fields
[07:47:12] <xxx1337> how do you add validation to the form and not individual fields
[07:47:40] <decx> jquery validate?
[07:52:49] <xxx1337> is that a plugin?
[07:53:02] <xxx1337> can i use it even though i already do validation on individual fields?
[08:04:10] <jangoh> i am trying to replace something inside a div http://dpaste.com/2MRSK7T
[08:04:11] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: depends how you do your validation. probably not. but it's really easy to port over
[08:04:31] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: maybe I misunderstood what you meant because I would consider jquery validator plugin still "validating individual fields"
[08:04:46] <dmsuperman> I have no idea how you would validate a whole form without it being individuals fields
[08:04:51] <red> jangoh: replace the text inside div
[08:04:54] <red> or the html inside a div
[08:05:44] <red> it would seem to me, that you are trying to empty the div with your code, so you could just do $(".woocommerce.info").html() or if you want to get rid of it, then use .remove()
[08:06:21] <jangoh> that div may have something else than this
[08:06:23] <dmsuperman> seems like you're trying to remove only a certain piece of the inner HTML, not the whole thing
[08:06:29] <dmsuperman> for that, I would wrap whatever you want to remove in a span with a class
[08:06:32] <dmsuperman> and hide/remove by class
[08:06:37] <dmsuperman> instead of doing this sort of matching
[08:06:40] <dmsuperman> which is very flaky
[08:06:43] <jangoh> so i dont want to empty or remove it
[08:06:54] <jangoh> i want to replace only this notice
[08:07:02] <dmsuperman> see whatI just wrote ^
[08:07:44] <jangoh> its coming from wp functions dont want to edit the core files
[08:07:50] <jangoh> :/
[08:08:40] <jangoh> is it possible to replace such html elements with jquery?
[08:08:55] <jangoh> not only texts
[08:09:43] <rmill> of course
[08:10:16] <jangoh> pls how
[08:10:20] <rmill> jangoh: you can add/remove html elements in DOM/jQuery easy peasy
[08:10:32] <jangoh> i am trying to replace something inside a div http://dpaste.com/2MRSK7T
[08:11:31] <dmsuperman> you almost have it, use html instead of text though
[08:11:45] <dmsuperman> but I'm telling you this is a very finnicky approach, you'd do better to edit the relevant theme file
[08:11:53] <dmsuperman> (and no theme files are not core files)
[08:11:57] <jangoh> ah html
[08:12:03] <jangoh> works lol thanx
[08:12:41] <dmsuperman> another crappy solution slowly eroding at the web. *sips coffee*
[08:24:34] <jangoh> bbl
[08:30:25] <uskerine> hi, any idea/tip on why removeClass and addClass is not working for a bootstrap button?
[08:30:48] <robertmaxrees> you're not targeting the element correctly?
[08:32:09] <uskerine> yes I am
[08:32:19] <dmsuperman> fiddle
[08:32:19] <uskerine> as I also do a .html() and it changes its value
[08:32:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[08:32:25] <robertmaxrees> fiddle up pls :)
[08:32:39] <uskerine> can't fiddle easily, it is bloated with stuff
[08:32:41] <uskerine> :(
[08:32:50] <dmsuperman> you can't fiddle "select an element, call addClass"?
[08:32:58] <dmsuperman> nothing else is relevant
[08:33:04] <uskerine> shoud ('#id').html('...').removeClass("....").addClass("...."); work?
[08:33:19] <dmsuperman> yep as long as you pass an argument to html
[08:33:22] <dmsuperman> if you don't, it returns the string
[08:33:30] <dmsuperman> which wouldn't allow for removeClass to be called
[08:33:50] <uskerine> ok
[08:34:04] <dmsuperman> (I secretly love asking for a fiddle because most of the time it works like rubber duck debugging)
[08:35:09] <dmsuperman> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[08:35:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/472nw07x/ functioning example
[08:36:34] <uskerine> this works  $('#statusButton').addClass("myClass");
[08:36:55] <uskerine> but the same does not work if used within $('#setDraft').click(function(){   .....  }
[08:37:09] <robertmaxrees> no repeated IDs or anything, right?
[08:37:16] <uskerine> no
[08:37:26] <uskerine> plus .html() works and changes value
[08:37:47] <robertmaxrees> and you're feeting classnames without periods?  can you provide a fixee or something of just your code?
[08:37:48] <uskerine> maybe some weird interaction with bootstrap and/or the many plugins used?
[08:37:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[08:37:57] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't make a difference.
[08:38:15] <uskerine> why do you mean by feeting?
[08:38:21] <uskerine> I am using class names without periods
[08:38:32] <robertmaxrees> err, *feeding
[08:38:48] <robertmaxrees> mmk, then without a fiddle it's going to be next to impossible to help.
[08:39:32] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/LVRdDTpp
[08:40:02] <uskerine> Not  a fiddle, but please check if possible THIS DOES WORK / THIS DOES NOT WORK to see if there is something I am doing wrong
[08:40:24] <uskerine> if that should work I would try to set up the whole fiddle
[08:40:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:44:03] <uskerine> found it
[08:44:06] <uskerine> removeclass vs removeClass
[08:44:16] <uskerine> thanks anyway
[08:44:26] <robertmaxrees> rubber duck debugging :)
[08:45:55] <uskerine> rubber duck rocks
[08:53:28] <BillCriswell> Using iOS6 for testing. I kind of miss it.
[08:54:02] <Takumo> So if I'm creating a jQuery plugin, can I do a class selector scoped within `this`?
[08:54:26] <Takumo> so if I did $('#foo').myPlugin(); could myPlugin look for $('.bar') within $('#foo') ?
[08:54:41] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find()
[08:54:49] <robertmaxrees> or $('class', this);
[08:55:19] <Takumo> thanks robertmaxrees
[09:39:06] <Matt3o12> Hey, I'm try to add list items to an unordered list (ul) but I want to keep the item on the bottom where it is. Here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/1vnkL7o7/
[09:40:51] <Ronald2K> I am using an "on change" to update two textboxes. I know the change is firing but the values don't change. Can you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/0fspk2be/
[09:43:52] <BillCriswell> Matt3o12: you can use insertAfter, or prepend and count backwards.
[09:45:12] <BillCriswell> Er, insertBEfore
[09:45:21] <BillCriswell> Matt3o12: http://jsfiddle.net/1vnkL7o7/1/
[09:45:36] <Ronald2K> I used selected.data, but I must be doing something wrong
[09:45:37] <Matt3o12> Counting backwards: it isn't possible because the real data is already given and should be changed.
[09:45:42] <Matt3o12> Thank you!
[09:46:15] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:49:03] <BillCriswell> Matt3o12: You could also append them as you would and just move the top one to the bottom. Not sure which would be best though.
[09:58:34] <uskerine> how do I attach a data field in a POST request? -like in form submit-
[09:59:08] <uskerine> just the variable assignment, I know about $.ajax()
[10:00:20] <BillCriswell> uskerine: $.post('/foo', { id: 123 }); like this?
[10:00:41] <uskerine> like that, is that JSON?
[10:01:19] <uskerine> if I do $.post('/foo', 'id=12' );
[10:01:27] <uskerine> would it be like submitting a field form id=12?
[10:01:36] <BillCriswell> It can be json or a jsobject, I prefer to use $.serializeArray() which is an array of objects with name and value properties.
[10:01:55] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Yeah, that way to can also work.. but concatenation is no fun.
[10:02:13] <uskerine> I just have to send an ID
[10:03:12] <BillCriswell> Either way it's about the same amout of characters.
[10:05:50] <Ronald2K> This isn't changing my textbox values. Please advise: http://jsfiddle.net/0fspk2be/
[10:06:13] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: You want .val().
[10:06:18] <BillCriswell> Instead of .text()
[10:07:12] <Ronald2K> Ok... I changed that part and the textboxes change, but they go blank
[10:07:20] <Ronald2K> Thanks for taking a look btw
[10:10:15] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[10:10:25] <BillCriswell> Oh duh.
[10:10:46] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: http://jsfiddle.net/0fspk2be/1/
[10:11:16] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: http://jsfiddle.net/0fspk2be/2/ the option: was just something else cause I didn't see the very obvious issue haha.
[10:11:51] <uskerine> what about when server answers "12" (just a number) as text/html;charset=UTF-8 ? how could I read the answer in jQuery ?
[10:12:42] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You should be able to just output what it returns. It would be the response.
[10:13:06] <uskerine> could you please elaborate
[10:13:16] <BillCriswell> So $.post('returns-12/', {id: 123}).done(function(result){ /* result would be "12" */ });
[10:13:26] <uskerine> thanks
[10:13:27] <uskerine> great
[10:13:44] <Ronald2K> Perfect Bill. Thanks!
[10:14:07] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++
[10:14:52] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: No problem!

[10:22:10] <geri> hi, i have added a dynamic tab using jqueryui...how can i automatically remove the tab?
[10:24:23] <manu__> hello to all
[10:25:52] <motaka2> if $(".someClassName").myPlugin(); targets several elements how can I send unique configuration for each individually ?
[10:27:52] <BillCriswell> motaka2: You can target them individually.
[10:28:24] <BillCriswell> $('.someClass').foo({ initStuff: "Weeeee" }); $('.someClassOne').foo("option", 4);
[10:29:42] <motaka2> BillCriswell: Is it wise to build plugins $.fn.plugName? I don't find it flexiable
[10:30:16] <BillCriswell> That's where I think it would need to be to use it like a plugin.. What do you mean inflexible?
[10:31:30] <motaka2> BillCriswell: for example right now I have plugin which does some auto suggest staff
[10:31:39] <motaka2> BillCriswell: lemme think about it more
[10:31:54] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:36:57] <motaka2> BillCriswell: is it allright to put configs in data-x like attrs  ?
[10:37:13] <manu__> im trying to use jquery autocomplete with php, php send the data javascript recieve the data but it doesnt display it, i dont get it, this is my code http://pastebin.com/jvm4ufm3
[10:37:29] <BillCriswell> motaka2: I don't see why not.
[10:37:37] <motaka2> ok thx
[10:37:52] <ravigehlot> How can I rewrite Line 16 here: http://jsfiddle.net/eq1k5s31/
[10:39:11] <manu__> can some one help me?
[10:39:19] <BillCriswell> I think you want: $(this).find('.something').on('change', ...);
[10:39:45] <BillCriswell> or .change(...), whichever.
[10:39:46] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: you are right hanks
[10:39:49] <ravigehlot> thanks
[10:40:05] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:41:07] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: Do I need to each() it like I did?
[10:42:45] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: You shouldn't have more than one id="country_id".
[10:43:07] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: I know
[10:43:14] <BillCriswell> As for the each, as far as I can tell you would need it for the code outside the chance.
[10:43:16] <BillCriswell> changE*

[10:50:14] <motaka2> BillCriswell: how can I change the list Item moseover event in a way that li on which tje mouse over is happening takes the highest z-index in this url http://fa.noondreams.com/TestPkg/MLM/Hor ?
[10:54:52] <motaka2> how can I change the list Item moseover event in a way that li on which tje mouse over is happening takes the highest z-index in this url http://fa.noondreams.com/TestPkg/MLM/Hor ?
[11:00:51] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I've inherited a site that uses paulirish's infinite-scroll plugin.  They would now like to filter all of the content on the page by category.  Is there a way to load all possible content so that I could then filter it and reapply the plugin to what remains?
[11:09:31] <shoky_> motaka2: why?  and why not remove the margin-right:2px from  .MLMHor li ul ul { .. }
[11:10:16] <dmsuperman> MarcGuay: You would be better off re-running the filter code after the infinite scroll plugin loads the next results
[11:10:25] <motaka2> shoky_: I dont have concenteration on thata but that also a problem. right now I really need to solve the overlap problem
[11:10:44] <dmsuperman> MarcGuay: "loading all possible content" is absolutely a performance nightmare and if your site is large enough will bring it crashing to its knees
[11:10:45] <MarcGuay> dmsuperman: Thanks for the idea
[11:11:13] <shoky_> motaka2: the change i suggested fixes the overlap, no?
[11:13:11] <motaka2> shoky_: no my friend, I mean over lap of upper whole meny with over lap of lower menu which happens just in first load
[11:15:20] <shoky_> motaka2: don't really understand what you mean then, sry
[11:15:31] <Uhkis> any suggestions for a date time picker?
[11:15:48] <motaka2> shoky_: thanks I will pose this again tomorrow in channel now I am on some other staff
[11:35:55] <MarcGuay> dmsuperman: The problem with that method is that it's possible that there are no items inside the current chunk which match the filter.
[11:36:11] <dmsuperman> MarcGuay: then you need to do the filtering on server side
[11:36:19] <dmsuperman> which is how it should be anyway
[11:36:30] <MarcGuay> dmsuperman: Yeah, it would require a large rework of the way it's set up.
[11:36:42] <dmsuperman> well take the time now to correct it! :D
[11:36:52] <dmsuperman> not being able to easily filter on server side indicates serious design issues
[11:52:03] <syosoft> hey guys, i'm looking around google and wherever else but not finding it - is it possible to serialize only those form fields that are found within a selector?
[11:52:27] <BillCriswell> syosoft: Yes. It works probably exactly as you'd imagine.
[11:52:41] <syosoft> ok, weird, must be an issue w/ the selector, just making sure. thanks.
[11:55:05] <BillCriswell> syosoft: Hmm... You might need to select the inputs directly and not just a common parent.
[11:55:36] <BillCriswell> syosoft: http://jsbin.com/rezaguqayalu/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:58:22] <syosoft> if i delete the form tag and widdle the selector down to .foo, i'm still seeing the 3 fields in the output. thou i've never used jsbin, so not sure if i'm seeing what i should be seeing.
[11:59:28] <BillCriswell> sysYou need to target those inputs directly.
[11:59:34] <BillCriswell> syosoft: ^^
[11:59:45] <BillCriswell> So .foo :input could work.
[12:00:05] <syosoft> well, what i mean is, when i changed what i changed, and hit run with js again, nothing changed leading me to believe it still worked.
[12:00:09] <syosoft> but yea, i spose a :input wouldn't hurt
[12:00:47] <BillCriswell> syosoft: http://jsbin.com/rezaguqayalu/2/edit?html,js,output
[12:01:10] <syosoft> i see that.
[12:01:39] <syosoft> however, it's annoying how it's showing me 3 form fields in the output column when one would expect a serialized string.
[12:01:53] <syosoft> .fxo :input...
[12:01:55] <syosoft> click run
[12:01:59] <syosoft> still shows me the same 3 fields
[12:02:07] <syosoft> jsbin.com doesnt make sense.
[12:02:43] <BillCriswell> I am only seeing 2 fields.
[12:03:04] <BillCriswell> In the log.
[12:03:17] <BillCriswell> There's three fields in the html to show it's only getting certain ones.
[12:03:47] <BillCriswell> If you want a serialized string use .serialize() instead of .serializeArray()
[12:04:07] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/rezaguqayalu/3/edit?console
[12:04:38] <syosoft> yea, i see it now that i opened hte console column, why are there 3 fields in the output column thou?
[12:04:58] <BillCriswell> I just explained that.
[12:07:02] <syosoft> I guess. My brain doesn't see how 3 form fields equate at all to the "output" of the js command(s).
[12:07:39] <BillCriswell> What js commands?
[12:07:42] <syosoft> anyway. in summary - it doesn't at all work how I'd expect and requires :input selector along with their parents.
[12:07:52] <syosoft> thanks for doing a little research - i'll impliment.
[12:08:13] <syosoft> people are on edge today, it's making me laugh.
[12:08:28] <syosoft> just had a client suggest that words like "complete ignorance" is inappropriate for "this setting" where "this setting" is an email....
[12:08:36] <syosoft> can you guess which region of the country he was from?
[12:08:42] <BillCriswell> No idea.
[12:08:49] <syosoft> The South.
[12:09:21] <syosoft> where apparently ignorant means stupid - must be a custom dictionary they don't release north of Virginia.
[12:12:46] <BillCriswell> complete ignorance sounds a bit harsh to me.
[12:13:21] <syosoft> Well, it would to most.
[12:13:35] <syosoft> Thou, making that judgement and being completely ignorant of the context in which it was used....
[12:14:12] <syosoft> well, one can hope our youth are being better educated :D
[12:14:26] <BillCriswell> Fair enough!
[12:21:40] <joshlegs> so, the little speech bubble thing that shows up for tooltips, that's called a balloon right?
[12:22:04] <joshlegs> trying to get my jquery search results more accurate
[12:22:11] <thebope> I think in NY people can take ignorance as a negative
[12:22:18] <thebope> "You ignant"
[12:23:34] <thebope> Not that many people call me ignorant but I don't think of it as a negative really. It just means someone hasn't learned about something
[12:23:46] <thebope> I'm ignorant in many areas and fields
[12:26:41] <BillCriswell> joshlegs: I just call them tooltips usually.
[12:26:49] <NoiseEee> joshlegs: i think they're indeed just called 'tooltips'
[12:26:56] <BillCriswell> thebope: Yeah, the word has definitely been abused.
[12:26:59] <joshlegs> ahh ok
[12:27:54] <joshlegs> hmm. well is there a handy plugin that lets you popup tooltips over an text input field if certain conditions are met (which you'd set through if/else statements) ? i dont see anything but i dont know if im just being retarded with my searches
[12:28:56] <NoiseEee> joshlegs: you just need a tooltip you like, and programatically have them appear wherever you deem fit
[12:29:10] <BillCriswell> joshlegs: You can just use a title attribute on an element to get the OS native ones.
[12:29:41] <joshlegs> ok so i shouldnt have to write a lot of css is what it sounds like you're saying :D
[12:30:20] <BillCriswell> joshlegs: If the default browser ones are all right with you it's literally just adding title="Fill in this thing"
[12:31:08] <joshlegs> BillCriswell: yeah. cool, thank you very much for the help. I really am still new to javascript/jquery, so i still dont know how to search for what i want very well
[12:32:06] <BillCriswell> "jquery tooltips" would have returned a bunch, but depending on what you need it might have been too much.
[12:32:49] <JenniferB2> i am trying to figure out history.pushState ... when I try to navigate backwards.. the event window.onpopstate is supposed to fire, however the event is the last pushed one, which is not strange, but what you really want is the state before, the one you are about to navigate to... how is this best handled, i can pop again myself... but perhaps there is some neet code out there? ?
[12:32:55] <joshlegs> i think i tried searching that at some point, but mostly it was things like "jquery popup message" and similar queries
[12:32:59] <krambiorix> when i trigger "change" on an input field, the page scrolls to that field... How can i disable that?
[12:33:31] <JenniferB2> *neat
[12:35:35] <krambiorix> is it even possible?
[12:43:26] <geri> hi, is someone using jquery to dynamically add tabs?
[12:43:55] <geri> i want to modify the content within a tab...will i need to remove the tab and add with modified content again??
[12:44:59] <WebDragon> heya folkz :)
[12:45:24] <JenniferB2> i find it problematic that you cannot push a state onto the history and then when the back button is fired, it is the same state..
[12:46:10] <WebDragon> quick question.. is there any way to hide a back-to-pagetop link at the bottom of content, if it is within the threshold of the first part of the pageview within a desktop browser (such that to view the whole content, no pagedown was necessary, thus obviating the need for the back-to-top link)
[12:46:23] <WebDragon> and then have it show up if one was required to scroll down to view more content
[12:46:34] <geri> WebDragon: use a tab?
[12:47:07] <WebDragon> geri: mmm no, because the page content is singular for this template and doesn't lend itself well to tabbed sections on a page
[12:47:13] <geri> http://www.java2s.com/Tutorials/Javascript/jQuery_UI/Tab/Build_jQuery_UI_Tabs_Simple_manipulation_in_JavaScript.htm
[12:47:20] <geri> oh
[12:47:34] <WebDragon> it's just that some content is fairly long and the back to top link gets you back to where the documentation downloads are visible at the top of the sidebar
[12:47:46] <WebDragon> good thought though. points for that
[12:47:58] <geri> hu?
[12:48:37] <WebDragon> I just would like to hide the link if it's visible in the topmost part of the pageview (such as when 100% of the content area above the footer is visible when the page first loads
[12:51:49] <DobreJoe> Hi, how do I select input:checkbox  when they have been just loaded from an AJAX call? From what I'm reading .on() can bind to elements that are still not accesible but this is not happening.
[12:54:52] <ravigehlot> How can rewrite that in one block of code without the two separate mouseover/mouseout
[13:05:39] <red> DobreJoe: add your jQuery to the success of the ajax call, where you shove the input into the page
[13:05:41] <BillCriswell> DobreJoe: You'd want to use event delegation.
[13:06:05] <DobreJoe> thanks, just thant, I'm trying event delegation
[13:06:43] <DobreJoe> the second parameter in the on() function was missing:
[13:06:44] <DobreJoe> on( "change", ":checkbox", function()
[13:06:54] <BillCriswell> $('.some-container').on('change', 'input[type=checkbox]', function () { }); then, no matter how checkboxes get put inside .some-container that even will fire.
[13:07:34] <DobreJoe> Thank you so much
[13:12:01] <_bart> Hey all, looking for a jQuery horizontal content slider that plays well with form elements, I used http://bxslider.com, but it duplicates slides and that means it's copying the <input> elements with chaos as a result.
[13:13:49] <nicetry_> some dev gave an input an id of id="something.somethingElse". This is probablly not allowed (html spec wise) but that's besides the point because I don't have access to that part of the code so I can't change it.  The question is: can I target it with jquery? And if so, how??
[13:14:41] <nicetry_> '$("#something.somethingElse") returns nothing because nothing has a class of 'somethingElse' and an ID of 'something'
[13:18:41] <nicetry> anyway know what I can do to escape the .
[13:20:37] <red> ..what?
[13:21:16] <nicetry> just got it
[13:21:27] <red> yes, dots are not allowed in class\id names
[13:21:34] <nicetry> jQuery("#something\\.somethingElse")
[13:21:42] <red> ugh :P
[13:21:42] <nicetry> yeah, but some bad devs don't play by the rules
[13:22:03] <BillCriswell> Ick.
[13:23:01] <red> you could have also used $("div[id^='something']");
[13:23:15] <red> selects IDs that begin with the word something
[13:23:37] <BillCriswell> nicetry: The escaped way is probably faster(?) but $('div[id="foo.bar"]') is less gross looking.
[13:23:38] <red> ofcourse, replace div with the required html elements name
[13:23:53] <red> BillCriswell: exactly :>
[13:23:59] <nicetry> When one loose cannon dev who wouldn't play by the rules get paired up with nicetry - a strict by the book freelancer, anything can happen in
[13:24:09] <nicetry> BUDDY DEVS - THE SHITTY DEV MOVIE
[13:24:17] <BillCriswell> nicetry: I'd watch that.
[13:24:21] <BillCriswell> It'd be terrible.
[13:24:26] <BillCriswell> But I'd watch it.
[13:24:38] <red> Isn't that just an alias for the facebook movie
[13:25:20] <zogdog> What is the proper way to call ajax and save the data from a form back to the db?
[13:26:45] <dmsuperman> which db zogdog?
[13:26:57] <dmsuperman> oh wait this is #jquery, not #nodejs
[13:27:06] <dmsuperman> that's not a jquery problem zogdog
[13:27:12] <dmsuperman> $.ajax to make the ajax request though
[13:27:22] <zogdog> dmsuperman: okay ty
[13:27:43] <BillCriswell> zogdog: $.post('/foo/update/3', $('.some-form').serializeArray(), function (result) { /* Whatever is returned */ });
[13:28:15] <zogdog> BillCriswell: even if it's just updating?  Would I change post with put?
[13:28:30] <dmsuperman> that depends on your backend
[13:28:42] <nicetry> Coming next summer - BUDDY DEVS II: Commit e5a3466f377e14b7a6122a3bf06e87bcc741f117, wherein nicetry returns to #jquery with more stupid questions!
[13:29:00] <BillCriswell> I imagine you'd want to make sure in the result things went successfully. You can totally skip the callback if you'd like though.
[13:29:48] <zogdog> my backend is node with mongoDB
[13:35:37] <zogdog> Okay, I have a JSFiddle to see where my "put" / update is going wrong.  Thanks for looking!  http://jsfiddle.net/1oxua7xp/
[13:37:25] <zogdog> BillCriswell: Not sure if you saw my post, but here's my jsfiddle if you happen to see my mistake http://jsfiddle.net/1oxua7xp/
[13:43:50] <dmsuperman> zogdog: what is "going wrong"?
[13:44:25] <zogdog> dmsuperman: when i click submit, the changes I make to the forms are not updating to the DB.  So when I call a product again, it's still the old data before the update attempt
[13:45:07] <dmsuperman> what errors?
[13:45:34] <dmsuperman> and what does the network tab say?
[13:47:01] <zogdog> okay one sec
[13:48:24] <zogdog> dmsuperman: well the headers contain the form changes I entered
[13:48:41] <zogdog> dmsuperman: shows it as a pot
[13:49:21] <zogdog> but it's not sending that data to the mongoDB
[14:02:53] <maxpert> Hey
[14:05:47] <RhinoBoss> how can I set the selected entry of a select2 programmatically?
[14:07:04] <RhinoBoss> $('#selector').select2('val', val); does not work
[14:07:30] <nonconvergent> Hi.
[14:09:24] <Uhkis> RhinoBoss: http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#programmatic
[14:11:47] <NoiseEee> whats a select2
[14:12:25] <tw2113> ajax heavy plugin for "revamped" select inputs
[14:12:34] <tw2113> instead of listing everything right away
[14:12:40] <tw2113> you can just have it query as they type
[14:12:45] <DieguezZ> hi, how can i find selector for a nested element like..  $('.IframePrincipal > table > tbody > tr > td')..? thats not working for me
[14:13:31] <RhinoBoss> Uhkis: thanks, but any specifics from that? Im having a hard time finding something which works
[14:14:36] <dmsuperman> DieguezZ: what isn't working about it?
[14:15:06] <dmsuperman> DieguezZ: If you have <div class="IframePrincipal"><table><tbody><tr><td> that selector will definitely select that td
[14:15:28] <dmsuperman> Remember of course that > is the "directly descends" selector
[14:15:42] <DieguezZ> well
[14:15:46] <DieguezZ> http://www.diotronic.com/semiconductores/memorias/s-rams-nvrams_p_50.aspx
[14:15:58] <DieguezZ> thats the test site..
[14:16:35] <DieguezZ> i got to say i am using cheerio, i dont know if there are differences on selectors..
[14:16:52] <NoiseEee> DieguezZ: if you're actually looking for a table in an iframe... well the iframe is a different document.
[14:17:00] <dmsuperman> he's not, just a confusing class name
[14:17:06] <NoiseEee> fun
[14:17:08] <dmsuperman> that selector works fine on your demo site DieguezZ
[14:17:12] <DieguezZ> yeah
[14:17:14] <dmsuperman> I just ran it
[14:17:33] <dmsuperman> but I have no clue about cheerio and suspect #jquery won't know either
[14:17:39] <DieguezZ> i am building a scraper, for one site works, but i am having problems scraping this one
[14:18:10] <DieguezZ> yeah, as cheerio is jquery for server side, and there is no cheerio channel, i tried here xD
[14:18:44] <dmsuperman> so you're trying to do the selecting on server side?
[14:18:57] <DieguezZ> im not trying, i am doing it xD
[14:19:41] <dmsuperman> Ok let me restate: what exactly is the problem that you are having
[14:20:06] <dmsuperman> because as I said, $('.IframePrincipal > table > tbody > tr > td') most definitely returns a node on the web page you linked
[14:20:14] <DieguezZ> well, i am trying to scrape this site, but the scraper works for other sites..
[14:20:23] <DieguezZ> i just cant get the selectors i want
[14:20:29] <DieguezZ> title, price..
[14:20:57] <dmsuperman> well nobody here is psychic DieguezZ
[14:20:59] <dmsuperman> that I know of, anyway
[14:21:11] <DieguezZ> http://pastebin.com/LHbv7utz
[14:21:42] <DieguezZ> i want to scrape the url i gave u, and that its returning 0 for console.log(elements.length)
[14:26:16] <shoky_> DieguezZ: there's no <tbody> in the source html
[14:29:51] <DieguezZ> http://snag.gy/cCXtc.jpg
[14:30:00] <DieguezZ> i see it there shoky_
[14:30:59] <shoky_> DieguezZ: that's not the source html, that's a live view of the DOM. it's not what you're parsing with cheerio
[14:31:39] <shoky_> DieguezZ: right click the page->view source  to see the source html
[14:31:52] <DieguezZ> shoky_ u are my hero xD
[14:32:01] <shoky_> yey
[14:32:10] <robertbusy> he's everybody's hero :)
[14:32:30] <dmsuperman> no. just mine.
[14:36:58] <shoky_> ;o
[14:38:19] <]Anjo[> What is the best method to debug javascript?
[14:38:42] <systemfault> With sweat, blood and tears.
[14:38:49] <]Anjo[> lol
[14:38:57] <systemfault> (Your browser's dev tools :P)
[14:39:38] <]Anjo[> That's what I already use. I was thinking about if there is a better extension or something.
[14:39:54] <systemfault> ]Anjo[: What is your browser?
[14:40:06] <systemfault> I personally use chrome... and it really has everything I need.
[14:40:12] <]Anjo[> I have both chrome and Explorer.
[14:41:19] <]Anjo[> systemfault: Thanks, brother.
[14:42:39] <dmsuperman> ]Anjo[: what is lacking about your current dev tools?
[14:43:19] <]Anjo[> Actually, nothing. I was just wondering if there was a better tool to explore.
[14:44:36] <robertbusy> also, check out fixingthesejquery.com
[14:44:52] <robertbusy> it has a great overview of stuff like that.
[14:48:26] <jenia> hello. i cant run this example: http://jsfiddle.net/xswhwk20/
[14:48:58] <robertbusy> 1.6 doesn't support .on()
[14:49:47] <jenia> robertbusy, thanks.
[14:51:50] <jenia> robertbusy, I updated it and it still doesnt work. http://jsfiddle.net/xswhwk20/1/ maybe you know why?
[14:52:12] <]Anjo[> robertbusy: Thanks!
[14:53:41] <]Anjo[> robertbusy: Cool
[14:58:41] <thedevll> test
[14:58:43] <shoky_> jenia: jquery mobile is included twice 2 diff versions, and jsfiddle load setting is on "onLoad" so your code happens only after pageinit already happened. change it to No Wrap

[15:01:53] <]Anjo[> Does anyone know a framework named Handlebars?
[15:02:16] <robertbusy> it's a templating language iirc.
[15:02:37] <worc> ^yeah it's for templating
[15:02:57] <worc> http://handlebarsjs.com/
[15:03:02] <]Anjo[> Do you know if it is 'the best' option?
[15:03:15] <worc> depends on what you need i guess
[15:03:28] <worc> it's worked out pretty well so far on the project i'm on.
[15:03:47] <worc> pretty simple each-loops to parse some JSON into a nice looking view
[15:03:54] <Greener> Is there special setup I need to do to get widgets like autocomplete working? I copy/pasted the example here and there's no autocompletion. http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[15:04:05] <]Anjo[> Because I'm developing an ASP.Net MVC 4 solution and a friend of mine adviced me to use use jQuery because it's faster then standard MVC comunication.
[15:04:51] <robertbusy> Greener do you have the API endpoint setup?
[15:05:23] <Greener> I literally just copy/pasted it, so I'm guessing no
[15:05:37] <worc> ]Anjo[, do you get the razor engine in MVC4?
[15:06:11] <robertbusy> Greener depends on which one you copy/paste
[15:06:44] <Greener> The "view source" button on that page only shows one script
[15:06:58] <robertbusy> depends on which example you select.
[15:07:25] <Greener> Ah! I didn't notice there were others. So, "default functionality".
[15:07:59] <worc> jQuery is all front end, so any MVC you do is processed by the client. that can definitely feel faster than waiting for a page from the server
[15:09:15] <robertbusy> greengriminal mind sharing your code in a fiddle, then?
[15:09:41] <robertbusy> woops i meant Greener
[15:09:49] <robertbusy> damn autocomplete :)
[15:11:37] <Greener> robertbusy: http://jsfiddle.net/0bawr3k9/ <--- it works here, and it works on the site I took it from
[15:11:55] <Greener> Just not when I saved it to an html file and opened it locally
[15:17:52] <robertbusy> beacuse the external filepaths don't work.
[15:18:02] <robertbusy> slap http: in front of the script tag sources.
[15:19:13] <worc> Greener, you have to start a web server to get those URLs to work properly
[15:19:26] <worc> opening it locally isn't the same as running a local server
[15:20:08] <robertbusy> or just update the script sources to include http:  in fromt.
[15:20:10] <robertbusy> *front
[15:20:40] <worc> that's one solution, but for a CDN i think they want you to leave that open
[15:21:02] <robertbusy> doesn't matter.
[15:21:11] <robertbusy> that allows it to autocomplete to whatever the current page uses.
[15:21:15] <robertbusy> so you can use https OR http
[15:21:26] <worc> which is why CDNs give you snippets with the http omitted
[15:22:13] <robertbusy> right.
[15:22:21] <worc> it's not critical or anything. but for me it's lazier to just run a server that autocompletes, lol
[15:22:33] <robertbusy> that's the right way to do it generally.
[15:22:41] <robertbusy> but for somebody just getting started... :)
[15:28:23] <]Anjo[> worc: Yes, I'm using razor.
[15:29:01] <worc> ]Anjo[, i guess my advice is to stick with what you know
[15:29:48] <]Anjo[> My friend works for walmart as a developer and he ran a lot of tests and He prefers working with handlebars.
[15:29:56] <worc> assuming you're doing a project for work. if it's on your own time and you're looking to stretch yourself, jquery is definitely something to look into
[15:30:00] <]Anjo[> He doesn't use the Razor HTML Helpers at all.
[15:30:24] <]Anjo[> I'm already using jQuery with ajax and I'm loving it! lol
[15:30:54] <worc> handlebars is pretty straight forward then. idk if it's ever been called the 'best', but it's solid
[15:33:52] <]Anjo[> It seems the most famous one! :)
[15:36:17] <]Anjo[> worc: Thanks a lot for your help, dude. God bless you and robertbusy!
[15:41:23] <Greener> robertbusy worc: Adding http worked. I had no idea how to search that problem - thank you
[15:47:36] <robertbusy> Greener it's a relative link - works for protocols like it does for the rest of the link.
[16:09:09] <wa5ted> grafi: you there
[16:09:13] <wa5ted> Cork: yo
[16:09:16] <wa5ted> you there
[16:10:36] <rgenito> hmm, maybe this is more of a javascript question... but:
[16:10:49] <rgenito> line 7: http://pastie.org/private/ahshw0aazzshnotupqyyq
[16:10:59] <rgenito> is that guaranteed to be finished before the form gets submitted?
[16:11:12] <rgenito> i'm having a hard time determining why that value is not set in the post request :(
[16:23:40] <Jattenalle> rgenito, huh?
[16:24:21] <Jattenalle> the function for $.post() is for success, not before.. see http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[16:25:18] <Jattenalle> rgenito, so you submit the form, it succeeds, THEN the javacsript triggers to set the val of your elements
[16:25:30] <Jattenalle> not seeing it in your post is perfectly expected behaviour :)
[16:25:32] <il> what's the best plugin for working with tables? I'm getting tired of datatables and how glitchy it is
[16:38:29] <rgenito> Jattenalle, oh? @.@
[16:38:40] <rgenito> oh damn, i see the problem lol
[16:38:46] <rgenito> seriously, it took me that long lol
[16:52:53] <wa5ted> shoky_: you there
[16:56:26] <benlieb> what is the quickest way to handle the situation where there is no video on the page in this code: $('video')[0].pause()
[16:57:02] <benlieb> it currently errors when there are no videos. I can account for undefined with a simple if/then, but is there a cleaner way a la jquery?
[16:57:25] <robertmaxrees> .pause() only runs on the underlying DOM node, right?
[16:57:28] <Fall> if ($('video').length() > 0) {} ... maybe
[16:57:38] <Fall> length may be a property.
[16:57:45] <robertmaxrees> length IS a property.
[16:57:48] <Fall> it IS.
[16:58:07] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: right
[16:58:27] <robertmaxrees> then yeha, you'll have to manually run the check to see if the node exists first.
[16:58:51] <robertmaxrees> no magical jquery way iirc.
[16:59:16] <benlieb> is there no jquery equiv for rails' any? method?
[16:59:27] <robertmaxrees> what does "any" do?
[16:59:32] <benlieb> as in [...].any?
[16:59:44] <benlieb> returns true if there are any members
[16:59:55] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that the object is not a jquery object, so you can't take advantage of the jquery methods on it.
[17:01:50] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: yo head over to ##frontend
[17:01:56] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:01:57] <wa5ted> we building it up yo
[17:04:15] <benlieb> ok i guess this is as short as I can get this:
[17:04:22] <benlieb> video = $(e.target).find('video')[0]
[17:04:23] <benlieb> if (video){ video.pause()}
[17:04:39] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[17:04:57] <benlieb> tnx guys
[17:05:26] <robertmaxrees> though not sure what video will return if there's no match,.
[17:08:25] <ravigehlot> The following code is causing the fadeTo to fliker 4 times. Why is that?
[17:08:29] <ravigehlot> http://jsfiddle.net/msyyq96b/
[17:09:19] <ravigehlot> got it resolved
[17:16:08] <sammych> can I take any JS object and save it as a blob?
[17:16:49] <sammych> so that it preserves the classes, prototyped properties and etc?
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:17:32] <sammych> I'm making a hybrid app and need to persist the application state
[17:18:24] <sammych> if I have var appState = new MyFunctionPretendingToBeAClass()
[17:18:35] <robertmaxrees> save a JSON object with the appropriate data.
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> and save against that object.
[17:18:44] <robertmaxrees> or do calls to your backend.
[17:19:30] <sammych> I'm looking for a way to not have to serialize the object
[17:20:00] <sammych> because it means I need to recast all the objects back into their original types when I reload
[17:20:18] <sammych> and JSON.stringify doesn't read prototyped properties
[17:21:00] <sammych> I've already built into my 'classes' a toJSON() method, which manually sets out all the properties I want to save, but it's a manual process
[17:21:41] <sammych> which means it's prone to error by not making sure if any property names, additions/removal are mirrored to it
[17:23:43] <robertmaxrees> that setup seems kind of strange to me - why not just create an object that you record state against?
[17:23:45] <sammych> gonna see what Blob can do
[17:23:57] <sammych> it is an object?
[17:24:06] <robertmaxrees> dunno what "blob" is.
[17:24:11] <sammych> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
[17:24:13] <robertmaxrees> but everything in JS is an object.
[17:24:19] <sammych> exactly.
[17:24:57] <robertmaxrees> why not use localstorage instead of blob?
[17:25:10] <sammych> localstorage is string only
[17:25:29] <robertmaxrees> a serailized object, sure - blob is going to be similar.
[17:25:44] <robertmaxrees> but like i said, your setup seems strange.
[17:26:16] <sammych> I prototyped away metadata (date modified, isDirty, date added, etc)
[17:33:30] <Ronald2K> I was able to use an on Change function to update a text box value, but I am trying to figure out how to format the text once it changes. When I do, the html code shows
[17:33:47] <Ronald2K> Bill... Thanks again for your help earlier
[17:34:33] <robertmaxrees> Ronald2K define "Format the text once it changes".
[17:35:02] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: No problem at all!
[17:39:07] <Ronald2K> Sorry Robert, the Jquery updates the value of an input box on a form to a value, like "Category: Medical"
[17:39:29] <Ronald2K> but I want it the word "Category" to be bold
[17:39:51] <Ronald2K> but if I put <b> around the value for "Category:", it shows the code. It doesn't render it
[17:40:02] <sammych> it's an input box, it doesn't display HTML
[17:40:05] <robertmaxrees> right - you can't really format text in an input box.
[17:40:10] <sammych> unless...you turn on contenteditable
[17:40:23] <Ronald2K> I thought contenteditable was for divs
[17:40:34] <sammych> it's for anything
[17:40:45] <sammych> it just so happens that inputs are already editable ;)
[17:40:47] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable "In HTML5 any element can be editable."
[17:43:06] <Ronald2K> I set the input to contenteditable="true", and it still shows the code
[17:43:13] <Ronald2K> it doesn't format it. Still plain text
[17:43:41] <sammych> you probably need another solution
[17:43:45] <sammych> like displaying that output in a div
[17:44:25] <Ronald2K> I tried a div earlier. It formatted correctly, but did not update on the change, since the on change only works on input fields
[17:44:37] <Ronald2K> But I'm happy to change my solution
[17:44:40] <Ronald2K> as long as it works
[17:44:56] <sammych> the user always uses the input, the div is just ouput
[17:45:01] <sammych> forget about contentedittable
[17:45:17] <funnybun1y> you can't use markup in input fields
[17:45:23] <Ronald2K> I am only using an input because jquery will update it based on a change to a listbox
[17:45:26] <robertmaxrees> why are you styling text in there anyway?
[17:45:34] <robertmaxrees> why not edit the label for it instead?
[17:45:46] <funnybun1y> Ronald2K: bind to the keyup event to refresh the stuff then
[17:45:53] <robertmaxrees> or to the blur event
[17:45:57] <Ronald2K> My goal is to create text that can be copied by the user for their documents that is already formatted...
[17:46:07] <sammych> div?
[17:46:14] <funnybun1y> blur won't do it while the user types though
[17:46:20] <Ronald2K> user isn't typing
[17:46:28] <Ronald2K> user selects a value from a list
[17:46:29] <robertmaxrees> Ronald2K erm, that's not going to be reliable anyway...
[17:46:32] <Ronald2K> like "Atlanta"
[17:46:33] <sammych> blur always happens regardless of change, so you'll need logic for that as well
[17:46:42] <Ronald2K> and the input box updates with a predetermined value
[17:46:47] <Ronald2K> that is set in the javascript
[17:46:56] <funnybun1y> then why an input?
[17:47:18] <funnybun1y> just fire the update event of whatever it you are doing and add the markup?
[17:47:18] <Ronald2K> so I can attach a button to easily copy it to the user's clipboard
[17:47:21] <Ronald2K> and it updates
[17:47:31] <Ronald2K> If I could get jquery to update the value in the div, I would do that
[17:47:34] <Ronald2K> it would be much easier
[17:47:41] <Ronald2K> the div will format
[17:50:34] <funnybun1y> why can't you get jquery to update the value of the div?
[17:50:50] <funnybun1y> $('#div').html(myNewValue);
[17:51:09] <sammych> #div...eheheh
[17:51:41] <funnybun1y> :D
[17:52:16] <funnybun1y> $('div#div').hasClass('div').attr('div','div');
[17:53:50] <Ronald2K> funny, will that work as part of an .on('change', function() ?
[17:54:12] <Ronald2K> And, I only want to format part of the div, not the whole thing
[17:54:16] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() btw
[17:54:19] <robertmaxrees> not .attr9)
[17:54:21] <robertmaxrees> *attr()
[17:54:27] <sammych> I think there's some fundamentals missing ehre
[17:55:20] <robertmaxrees> dude wants to format, say, the first word when he injects two into a field.
[17:55:41] <robertmaxrees> so "City: Atlanta" - he wants 'City:' to be bolded.
[17:56:04] <Ronald2K> Robert - Exactly
[17:56:28] <robertmaxrees> that's something you need to do to an element that isn
[17:56:34] <robertmaxrees> *isn't an input.
[17:56:41] <robertmaxrees> basically, you can't have everything you want here.
[17:57:01] <funnybun1y> robertmaxrees: why?
[17:57:17] <robertmaxrees> he has a button he wants to be able to use to copy the text, formatting and all.
[17:57:28] <robertmaxrees> what sorts of browsers do we need to support?
[17:57:34] <funnybun1y> robertmaxrees: why user .prop()?
[17:57:36] <funnybun1y> -r
[17:57:51] <robertmaxrees> .prop() modifies the DOM object, .attr() the markup.
[17:57:55] <robertmaxrees> 9/10, you want the DOM
[17:59:00] <funnybun1y> robertmaxrees: what exactly is the difference??
[17:59:17] <funnybun1y> isn't the markup also part of the dom object?
[17:59:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:59:26] <robertmaxrees> the markup is what gets read into the DOM object.
[17:59:50] <funnybun1y> you are saying by using attr() i am removing and re-injecting the element?
[17:59:59] <Ronald2K> Modern browsers
[18:00:06] <robertmaxrees> i am saying you are modifying the markup, which isn't what you normally want.
[18:00:06] <Ronald2K> not worried about older browsers
[18:00:12] <funnybun1y> what?
[18:00:16] <robertmaxrees> funnybun1y http://stackoverflow.com/a/5876747/923919
[18:00:20] <robertmaxrees> you are convoluting
[18:00:24] <funnybun1y> if i do $('#blah').attr('class','some');
[18:00:30] <robertmaxrees> you want .prop() instead.
[18:00:32] <funnybun1y> i just add a class to a dom element
[18:00:48] <sammych> that's just so wrong
[18:00:52] <sammych> worst example, ever.
[18:00:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[18:01:21] <funnybun1y> right
[18:01:55] <funnybun1y> i don't get it.
[18:02:07] <funnybun1y> bring wrong would imply that it doesn't work.
[18:02:10] <robertmaxrees> funnybun1y did you read the response?
[18:02:29] <funnybun1y> $('body').attr('class','test'); <- sets the class attribute of the body tag in the currend DOM tree
[18:02:34] <funnybun1y> robertmaxrees: not yet
[18:02:41] <funnybun1y> if you mean the stackexchange thing, that is
[18:02:50] <robertmaxrees> basically, you want to read properties, instead of DOM attributes.
[18:03:13] <robertmaxrees> also: http://api.jquery.com/attr/ read this.
[18:05:36] <funnybun1y> i wasn't reading, i was setting.
[18:06:03] <funnybun1y> my interest wayned.
[18:06:24] <funnybun1y> thanks for.. not sure what though. sounds uselessly pedantic :)
[18:07:11] <BillCriswell> attr vs prop is no fun.
[18:07:42] <funnybun1y> serious business.
[18:08:06] <Ronald2K> So, here's what I have so far... http://jsfiddle.net/0fspk2be/3/
[18:08:11] <funnybun1y> i guess it matters to some in which direction the browser propagates these changes.
[18:08:19] <Ronald2K> I just want to be able to format the values that change after the listbox update
[18:08:24] <Ronald2K> I don't care how I do it.
[18:09:02] <Ronald2K> So I will want to bold the word "Catalog", and possibly parts of the description field as well
[18:09:46] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: Would it be whatever is before a : ?
[18:10:08] <Ronald2K> Not always
[18:10:30] <Ronald2K> I need to do this all over the app I am creating
[18:10:45] <Ronald2K> so parsing will probably not be always applicable
[18:11:00] <robertmaxrees> not pedantic - even the docs for .attr() suggest you use .prop() now.  minor distinction, but a good one to know :)
[18:11:09] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: Is there html for this set in stone?
[18:11:43] <Ronald2K> My plan was to keep it consistent, and not dynamic. Only the values will be dynamic
[18:11:47] <Ronald2K> if that's what you mean...
[18:12:02] <Ronald2K> like once I decide that "Category" will be bold, then it will always be bold for that case
[18:12:17] <BillCriswell> Why are some bold and some aren't?
[18:12:39] <Ronald2K> It's just to make the text copyable in the format that the customer wants
[18:12:59] <Ronald2K> so if they paste it into a report, they don't have to remember to go bold it... for consistency across users and reports
[18:13:21] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: Right, but why would some categories be bold and others now?
[18:13:41] <Ronald2K> They all would
[18:14:00] <Ronald2K> and in that case the word "Category" would be bold
[18:14:01] <Ronald2K> always
[18:14:32] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: http://jsfiddle.net/0fspk2be/4/ is what I'd probably do... but using that select feels weird but if it's what you need it works.
[18:16:28] <Ronald2K> Thanks Bill, but I could do that with a div. It no longer puts the value in an input box for easy copying by the user
[18:17:15] <BillCriswell> Why is the input any easier than copying the text?
[18:17:29] <benlieb> can someone help me transform this method into one the will work on ajax-loaded content? I think I might need to use .on() but I don't know how this works for submit events, instead of 'click' : https://gist.github.com/pixelterra/1214d652e5de6555004c
[18:17:51] <Ronald2K> a button, rather than selecting and right-clicking, or using Ctrl-C
[18:18:46] <Ronald2K> trying to idiot-proof the app
[18:18:57] <BillCriswell> benlieb: You would do like $(document).on('submit', 'form.cart_add_remove', function () { ... });
[18:19:08] <BillCriswell> You would pass the event to function.
[18:19:35] <benlieb> BillCriswell: ok, let me try that...
[18:21:23] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: How are you getting it to the clipboard with a button click?
[18:23:40] <Ronald2K> I was using a little flash button, but I am looking for a replacement that isn't flash so it will work on mobile browsers
[18:23:48] <Ronald2K> and more devices
[18:24:35] <Ronald2K> again, as long as it works with the on.change function I'll use whatever works.
[18:24:37] <benlieb> BillCriswell: not working
[18:25:04] <benlieb> BillCriswell: I think the problem is that I actually want to cancel the submit, or replace the submit function.
[18:25:13] <BillCriswell> That wouldn't matter.
[18:25:33] <benlieb> BillCriswell: what does .on('submit') actually mean?
[18:25:46] <benlieb> BillCriswell: does it replace the submit function?
[18:25:53] <BillCriswell> It's the same as .submit()
[18:26:02] <benlieb> BillCriswell: or just occur before it?
[18:26:15] <benlieb> BillCriswell: so it basically replaces the submit function?
[18:26:37] <BillCriswell> It can replace the submit function.
[18:26:49] <benlieb> BillCriswell: what do you mean by can?
[18:31:43] <BillCriswell> benlieb: http://jsbin.com/lufoquwikeku/1/edit?js,output
[18:33:37] <Ronald2K> Bill, do you have a better way of copying to the clipboard?
[18:34:13] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: Sadly no. I think it's a pretty crazy browser limitation.
[18:35:26] <Ronald2K> You would think it would be a basic function of any language, to have a command to copy the content of a field
[18:35:56] <Ronald2K> to the clipboard
[18:35:58] <BillCriswell> Luckily it's like the one thing almost ever user knows how to do.
[18:37:40] <Ronald2K> I may have to go with your latest suggestion, using the div, and then simply ask the users to select and copy
[18:38:26] <benlieb> BillCriswell: tnx! Got it working ;)
[18:38:34] <BillCriswell> benlieb: Sweet.
[18:40:20] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: Might be a way to improve it slightly.
[18:41:08] <Ronald2K> How so?
[18:42:57] <BillCriswell> Let me make up a dmeo.
[18:43:00] <BillCriswell> Hopefully.
[18:43:04] <BillCriswell> The range shit is annoying.
[18:43:10] <BillCriswell> But should be able to find most the code.
[18:43:11] <Ronald2K> Awesome! Thanks
[18:51:41] <sammych> just make them triple click on the text!
[18:52:15] <BillCriswell> .click().click().click()!
[18:52:25] <sammych> 'make *them*'
[18:52:33] <sammych> oh
[18:52:37] <BillCriswell> I was joking haha.
[18:52:41] <sammych> yeah, I got it
[18:52:43] <sammych> ;)
[18:52:49] <BillCriswell> I'm such a kidder.
[18:52:50] <sammych> trplClick()
[18:53:02] <sammych> quadClick
[18:53:11] <sammych> nClick(10, function() {})
[18:53:12] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: http://jsbin.com/cimegovisise/1/edit is what I came up with.. but I'm getting an annoying error which I'm too lazy to figure out now.
[18:53:18] <BillCriswell> sammych: Haha.
[18:55:37] <sammych> is the time span for first-click to last-click in double the same as triple, I wonder
[18:56:00] <sammych> if it's the same, then 10 clicks..whoa
[18:56:29] <Ronald2K> Ok Bill. Thanks for trying
[18:56:36] <Ronald2K> And thanks for the help.
[18:59:15] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:59:38] <BillCriswell> sammych: Sounds like it could get pretty out of control.
[19:04:03] <ew0> right channel for d3.js?
[19:58:44] <jrockjiggz_PC> Hi, i'm trying to preload a css background image. i've seen a few examples, but not with using if(this.complete) $(this).load();
[19:59:21] <jrockjiggz_PC> would: var c = new Image();  then can i use if(c.complete) ?
[20:04:21] <rgenito_> i'm doing an ajax call to an API of ours... and the API returns status 400
[20:04:42] <systemfault> rgenito_: 400 is bad request... perhaps it's missing a parameter or something.
[20:04:59] <rgenito_> systemfault, correct, but can i still retrieve the json data?
[20:05:04] <rgenito_> the request still returns json
[20:05:23] <systemfault> rgenito_: Could be a server-side issue...
[20:05:46] <rgenito_> is it still impossible to get the json?
[20:05:48] <systemfault> jrockjiggz_PC: loading an image is asynchronous... .complete will never be true.
[20:05:55] <rgenito_> systemfault, those are the specs of the system :(
[20:06:10] <systemfault> rgenito_: Your spec says to return JSON on a bad request?
[20:06:14] <rgenito_> so, the response is entirely expected
[20:07:13] <jrockjiggz_PC> systemfault: thx
[20:07:20] <rgenito_> i'm doing the javascript, and yes, the specs/docs say, "status 400 will be returned if there is problem with this input: more information will be in the 'details' property, "
[20:07:56] <rgenito_> the 2 guys working on the back end are very experienced... so i am hesitant to say, "hey dumb ass... don't return status 400"
[20:08:00] <rgenito_> :D
[20:08:44] <systemfault> I understand... but still
[20:09:59] <rgenito_> so yes/no: can javascript read the response, regardless of status code?
[20:10:16] <systemfault> rgenito_: Sure, handle the error
[20:10:21] <rgenito_> ahhh
[20:10:41] <rgenito_> ooooooooooooh i see... i was using a "success" function to read whether data was there or not
[20:11:49] <rgenito_> ty systemfault ;)
[20:15:45] <jrockjiggz_PC> it seems .css() adds inline styling.  is there any way todo global scope styling?
[20:36:54] <jrockjiggz> i'm trying to pass a global defined variable into jquery function...
[20:37:21] <jrockjiggz> var globalVar=1;  $( function(){  console.log(globalVar); //1 });
[20:37:23] <jrockjiggz> but,
[20:38:02] <jrockjiggz> $(function(){ somefunction( function(){ //callback;  console.log(globalVar); //undefined });
[20:40:13] <jrockjiggz> must be a conflict. i should attach to window var
[20:55:09] <jrockjiggz> hi, anyone know why $(this) is undefined? https://dpaste.de/5XS7
[20:56:20] <jrockjiggz> eh.. its actually is..
[20:56:23] <jrockjiggz> nm
[21:30:15] <jrockjiggz> is there a way to apply a jquery method to a collection jquery objects?
[21:30:48] <jrockjiggz> I have $this, which is passed in.  i want to find various elements and apply the same effect
[21:32:47] <jrockjiggz> I can use this:
[21:32:47] <jrockjiggz> .css({
[21:32:47] <jrockjiggz> 			width: cellWidth_single+'px',
[21:32:47] <jrockjiggz> 			maxWidth: cellWidth_single+'px',
[21:32:48] <jrockjiggz> 			//height: cellHeight+'px' //css does not require this but can be set anyways if you want
[21:32:48] <jrockjiggz> 		});
[21:32:50] <jrockjiggz> sorry..
[21:32:59] <jrockjiggz> do this: $([$this, $this.find('img'), $this.find('.mask'), $this.find('.content')])
[21:40:34] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: If I understand it, you're overcomplicating it... perhaps because you're not familiar with CSS
[21:41:25] <systemfault> $this.find('img, .mask, .content').add($this).css(....) could probably do it.
[22:08:47] <Jonno_FTW> how do I have a function execute immediately?
[22:42:10] <krishnaveda> apart from adding timestamp to the URL is there a neater, standard way of preventing browser side caching of csv download ?
[22:42:33] <Jattenalle> configure the server to never cache that resource
[22:42:59] <phiz_> browser's don't always behave
[22:43:18] <Jattenalle> yeah, but not much you can do about that
[22:43:50] <Jattenalle> also, you dont need timestamp, just passing anything, such as ?1 "should" trigger a fresh grab
[22:43:57] <Jattenalle> since ?x indicates it's dynamic content
[22:44:05] <Jattenalle> any browser that doesnt is bad and should feel bad.
[22:45:35] <rgenito_> Jattenalle, lol ... and its feelings should be hurt >[
[22:58:39] <Jattenalle> just in case anyone in here speaks chinese (or some other asian language that this might be :/ ) http://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/2dygtm/unknown_english_image_looks_asian/
[22:58:52] <jop008> Anyone knows how to make an autocomplete item with a button to the right?
[23:01:53] <jop008> the select mode must be at the right http://jsfiddle.net/9uxtT/8/
[23:03:17] <jop008> this is the code http://jsfiddle.net/9uxtT/9/
[23:03:44] <jop008> Tried searched for 4-5 hours for that :-(
[23:21:19] <Cork> jop008: you mean something like http://jsfiddle.net/9uxtT/10/ ?
[23:21:53] <jop008> Yep amazing what did you change?
[23:22:00] <Cork> moved the a tag
[23:22:09] <Cork> and changed from float left to float right
[23:22:57] <jop008> not that intuitive and the field containt label is now gone?
[23:23:26] <jop008> The label is find an antitytype
[23:23:29] <Cork> jop008: the label is positioned identical to before
[23:23:31] <krishnaveda> Jattenalle> configure the server to never cache that resource …. any idea how ?
[23:23:46] <Cork> at least on my browser
[23:23:54] <jop008> But now the label is under an other element
[23:23:55] <Jattenalle> krishnaveda, depends on your http server, but a configured .htaccess should do the trick
[23:24:03] <Cork> it was before too
[23:24:28] <Cork> hmm the float trick doesn't work in chrome...
[23:24:40] <jop008> it must be <label> <autocomplete list><button>
[23:24:47] <jop008> on one row
[23:25:06] <krishnaveda> Jattenalle, I am using glass fish as app server
[23:25:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9uxtT/11/ this one works in chrome too
[23:29:27] <krishnaveda> Jattenalle, will cache: false in ajax. request help ?
[23:29:33] <Jattenalle> yes
[23:29:35] <krishnaveda> for all browsers ?
[23:29:37] <Jattenalle> yes it will
[23:29:46] <Jattenalle> for all browsers that arent stupid at least
[23:30:17] <krishnaveda> Jattenalle, and .htaccess seems to be for web servers rendering static assets ilke apache.. in my case its the same app server rendering static assets too
[23:30:24] <krishnaveda> Jattenalle, :D
[23:31:16] <jop008> when I shuffle the button code the layout is not improved looking at the label as well http://jsfiddle.net/9uxtT/12/
[23:33:06] <Cork> jop008: the label is positioned under the input cause of the margin: -15 -5px on the form
[23:33:25] <jop008> I take a look
[23:34:50] <jop008> So how to improve this?
[23:36:41] <Cork> jop008: you would have to override the margin rule for it
[23:39:55] <jop008> when I change my code to the fiddle the screen is rendered poor with only the label on its correct place
[23:40:17] <jop008> the button is to high and the listitem start at  a new line at the left
[23:40:32] <jop008> jqm 1.4.3
[23:41:26] <jop008> Why not like this <div>label<listitem> and then the button?
