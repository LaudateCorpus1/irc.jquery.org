[13:19:43] <Guest6616> if you have jquery being bundled with webpack, and you are extended jquery, you dont need to wrap it in a (function($) { ... do you?
[13:20:18] <z1haze> not sure what was up with the Guest name
[17:46:15] <Destramic> im adding input to the dom is there any reason why i wouldnt seen the input or its value when accessing $('form').serialize() ?
[17:53:43] <shoky> Destramic: one reason could be that it doesn't have a `name` attribute
[17:59:51] <Destramic> shoky: ok thank you for tip
[18:00:59] <Destramic> https://pastebin.com/cTRY5UFE   i have  no clue, heres my html, all seem fine, even valuated it
[18:08:49] <shoky> Destramic: make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[18:14:24] <Destramic> shoky: pm'd you
[18:29:26] <Destramic> is there any readon why read only inputs wont show in form data?
[18:59:40] <robertmaxrees> destramic share the fiddle to the channel showing the problem :)
[19:03:12] <Destramic> robertmaxrees: turned out to be some input name issues and html error, thank you all
[19:03:17] <Destramic> :)
[19:04:24] <robertmaxrees> heh, alright.
[22:03:59] <robertparkerx> What am I doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/8gxkzes9/
[22:04:20] <robertparkerx> I've tried next
[22:04:42] <robertparkerx> ah find works
[22:04:44] <robertmaxrees> .closest() starts at the current element and then goes through ancestors.  you want .find() with searches through all descendents.
[22:04:50] <robertmaxrees> *which
[22:05:10] <robertparkerx> ty robertmaxrees
[22:05:13] <robertparkerx> happy thanksgiving
[22:05:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
