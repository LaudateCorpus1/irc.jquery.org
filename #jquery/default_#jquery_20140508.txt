[00:06:12] <abishek> does somebody here have experience with malsup cycle plugin http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle
[00:12:33] <fn> abishek: used it one time for a project
[00:13:22] <xec> abishek: just ask the question, maybe someone who have experience with it can't help you and someone without might be able to
[00:13:25] <abishek> fn, am using this plugin with bootstrap, the problem that I am having is, as soon as I initialize this plugin, it affects the styling of my page. am not sure what I need to fix it
[00:14:48] <fn> the plugin overwrites your styles?
[00:14:52] <abishek> am just preparing a fiddle
[00:28:57] <fn> abishek: i see a query, but blocked by default, sorry.
[00:32:20] <abishek> fn, can i give you the url to my test server, so that you can look at that for an example?
[00:33:35] <abishek> what I am trying to acheive is a very simple stuff, which I could even do it using jquery animate, but I dont have much experience with jquery animate, so I resolved to cycle
[00:45:52] <fn> sorry can't handle your bug now, have to fix own things currently.
[00:56:28] <brunoais> abishek, what's your situation? Maybe I can help
[01:03:17] <FransNL_> how do i get the returned data from $.get outside of the $.get?
[01:03:33] <Cork> FransNL_: you don't
[01:03:47] <Cork> FransNL_: "outside" is before the code inside has ran
[01:03:55] <Cork> so it can't get something that happens in the future
[01:04:16] <FransNL_> makes sense
[01:04:39] <FransNL_> so i need to pass it to a function from inside the $.get
[01:05:09] <Cork> simplest is most likely to use the promise returned by $.get
[01:05:22] <FransNL_> ok
[01:05:28] <Cork> then what ever wants the data can do variable.done(function(data) { /* work with data */ })
[01:05:56] <FransNL_> ok.. thnx
[01:07:04] <Cork> example: function fetch() { return $.get(...); }; fetch().done(function(data) { alert(data); }).fail(function() { alert("I'm a baad boy"); });
[01:28:02] <Bheam> yo
[01:28:24] <Bheam> how does jquery store which css 'display' to go back to after hide/show() ?
[01:28:54] <Bheam> if i start with inline-block, then hide, then show it goes back to inline-block, but if i start with 'none' then it goes to 'block'
[01:29:52] <mada> $.get( "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heroku/app.json/master/package.json", function( data ) { 			// $( ".result" ).html( data ); 			alert( "Load was performed." ); 		}, 'json');
[01:29:55] <mada> whats wrong with this code
[01:30:00] <mada> my $.get wont work
[01:30:02] <mada> :-/
[01:30:33] <mada> all im trying to do is alert the content gotten from the get request
[01:30:51] <mada> $.get( "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heroku/app.json/master/package.json", function( data ) {         alert( "Load was performed." ); 		}, 'json');
[01:30:56] <Jattenalle> mada, you cant do that, same origin policy
[01:31:10] <Jattenalle> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy
[01:31:29] <mada> it has to be on my server?
[01:31:51] <Jattenalle> has to be in the same place as the script with the .get in it, yeah
[01:31:58] <mada> hmm.. if so id have to use ajax
[01:32:00] <mada> ok
[01:32:10] <Jattenalle> it's the same with ajax
[01:32:16] <Jattenalle> it's how browser security works
[01:32:35] <mada> alright i actually wanna load a local file
[01:32:40] <mada> so let me try that
[01:34:04] <mada> im running this script from an index.html file which is in the uppermost level of my app folder and in the app directory i have another folder called 'js'
[01:34:10] <mada> i did this $.get( "js/levels/dungeon.json", function( data ) { 			// $( ".result" ).html( data ); 			alert( "Load was performed." ); 		}, 'json');
[01:34:16] <mada> but still no bueno on that alert
[01:34:22] <mada> :/
[01:35:08] <mada> the alert func is on a new line, its not commented just so u know
[01:39:31] <mada> nvm
[01:39:33] <mada> it works
[02:14:18] <FransNL_> when working with JSON data that’s multiple levels deep. Do i simply put $.each inside of $.each inside of $.each ?
[02:14:23] <FransNL_> or is there another way?
[02:16:42] <brunoais> FransNL_, that depends on your use-cases
[02:18:12] <FransNL_> fair enough
[02:22:07] <slax0r> hi, I have a string: var str = "[4,3,3]";, can I convert this to a regular array?
[02:22:47] <brunoais> slax0r, yes
[02:23:00] <brunoais> JSON.parse()
[02:23:26] <slax0r> brunoais: thanks!
[02:37:17] <sama> im using --->         $.get( path, function( data ) { results = data; });           I'm trying to declare a global variable inside my $.get function and call that variable from outside
[02:37:20] <sama> but i get nothing
[02:37:23] <sama> can someone help?
[02:37:34] <sama> ive tried window.results
[02:37:40] <sama> $.results
[02:37:48] <sama> and alerted those outside the $.get but
[02:37:50] <sama> no luck
[02:46:28] <rindolf> sama: why not do «var results;» outside?
[02:47:34] <sama> i tried but it doesnt work
[02:48:03] <sama> i get a blank alert dialog
[02:48:52] <sama> var results;            $.get( path, function( data ) { results = data; });           alert(results);         gives me a blank response
[02:49:08] <rindolf> sama: note that you need to do the altert only after the callback fires.
[02:49:14] <rindolf> sama: you need to wait for it.
[02:49:34] <sama> how do i do that
[02:49:53] <rindolf> sama: do something in the callback.
[02:50:04] <Cork> sama: the callback runs when the data comes
[02:50:14] <Cork> so your alert happens before results is set
[02:50:17] <rindolf> sama: AJAX is called *Asynchronous* JavaScript And XML for a reason.
[02:50:46] <FransNL_> sama… that was the same thing i was trying to do
[02:50:58] <FransNL_> pass the data outside the $.get
[02:52:27] <sama> thats what im trying to do FransNL_
[02:53:08] <sama> i tried sending it to a global var in the callback and then tried to alert that afterward and it didnt show up
[02:53:12] <Cork> sama: function fetch() { return $.get(...); }; fetch().done(function(data) { alert(data); }).fail(function() { alert("I'm a baad boy"); });
[02:53:32] <Cork> you can't get the data inline in the code
[02:53:38] <Cork> cause you don't know when the data will come
[02:53:48] <Cork> so you have to wait for it
[02:54:17] <sama> alright i get it let me give it a shot fellas
[03:00:46] <JustMozzy> hello. does anyone know his way around jcarousel? am trying to use its scroll method but jquery gives me an error that >.jcarousel-item-+=2 is an unrecognized expression
[03:01:25] <sama> Cork: function fetch() { return $.get(...); }; fetch().done(function(data) { window.results = data; }).fail(function() { alert("I'm a baad boy");    alert(window.results)});      in fetch().done im trying to add a global var that i can call from outside the func
[03:01:38] <sama> but it wont go through when i alert it :/
[03:02:01] <Cork> sama: you don't want to do that in fail
[03:02:10] <Cork> sama: also you don't need to store results globally
[03:02:16] <Cork> just use the data in the .done callback
[03:02:54] <Cork> sama: function fetch() { return $.get(...); }; var request = fetch(); request.done(function(data) { alert(data); });
[03:03:00] <Cork> that would basically do what your trying to do
[03:04:12] <sama> ok i see
[03:05:04] <sama> coming from java, c, and php... i love js but im gonna read the book cuz its not all that similar haha
[03:05:34] <sama> thanks guys that cleared it up
[03:05:45] <Cork> sama: this isn't really dependent on javascript
[03:06:12] <Cork> sama: the code problem you see is cause of async
[03:06:28] <sama> thats where i was gettin at
[03:06:29] <Cork> and you get this if you use thread for example in any langauge (unless you sync the threads)
[03:06:49] <Cork> and the .done structure is promise
[03:07:04] <Cork> and many languages add this to help handle async ness in code
[03:07:19] <Cork> it wasn't even invented for js
[03:09:35] <sama> like how node.js waits for callbacks before serving but still continues to execute remaining code even if callback isnt finished
[03:10:06] <slax0r> weird situation
[03:10:39] <slax0r> swaping two values in an array, console log before and after the swap, but both logs are the same, both swapped?
[03:10:42] <slax0r> http://jsfiddle.net/kF89j/
[03:11:32] <Cork> slax0r: ya, cause your changing the same array
[03:11:47] <Cork> you just have two variables pointing to it
[03:12:27] <Cork> slax0r: http://jsfiddle.net/kF89j/1/
[03:17:21] <beasty> morning Cork !
[03:36:31] <binaryclock> hello.. I have a function that starts like this: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=gXj63FF8   ... how can I call it from javascript somewhere else in my code?    I have tried this:  " (function() { worker1(); });"  it doesn't seem to fire
[03:38:41] <Cork> binaryclock: you can't
[03:38:54] <Cork> binaryclock: that function isn't public
[03:39:20] <binaryclock> ohh, how can i make it public?  sorry i'm a noob to jquery and high level stuff, i'm an asm/c low level coder mostly
[03:39:54] <Cork> well the code most likely looks like (function worker1() { $.ajax(...); ... })();
[03:40:07] <binaryclock> yeah
[03:40:14] <Cork> what you would have to do is either make the function global
[03:40:22] <binaryclock> i can do that
[03:40:22] <Cork> well ya... :)
[03:40:34] <Cork> that is what you have to do on second though ^^'
[03:40:52] <binaryclock> how do i make it global?
[03:40:55] <Cork> so (function worker1() { $.ajax(...); ... })(); would have to change to function worker1() { $.ajax(...); ... }; worker1();
[03:41:04] <binaryclock> ok thanks
[03:41:12] <binaryclock> i see, the ( ) are for scope
[03:41:16] <binaryclock> thanks
[03:41:19] <Cork> not really
[03:41:29] <krambiorix> how can i make a signed integer from a string like "-1" ?
[03:41:30] <Cork> () is to help the parser
[03:41:58] <Cork> binaryclock: what you had before is a self executing function
[03:42:09] <Cork> binaryclock: and self executing functions is what is normally refered to as scopes
[03:42:10] <binaryclock> you are correct, it was on a timer
[03:42:45] <Cork> krambiorix: parseInt or +"-1"
[03:43:03] <Cork> if you use parseInt DON'T FORGET the base at the end
[03:43:10] <Cork> parseInt(string, 10)
[03:43:30] <krambiorix> Cork, okay, thanks!
[03:43:53] <Cork> krambiorix: also note you don't really get a signed integer
[03:43:56] <Cork> you get a number
[03:44:02] <Cork> that is all you have in js
[03:45:49] <binaryclock> Cork, thank you so miuch, works now
[03:47:22] <krambiorix> Cork, yeah, it works
[04:01:11] <the_last> hey I have the following, but I'm having trouble selecting the reply button to set its class, how would I do that given the structure of my html? https://gist.github.com/pobri19/4cfa183df67fa7f19013
[04:01:26] <the_last> The part I'm referring to is:         $(this).siblings('.replycontrol').siblings('replybutton').removeClass("btn-unactivated");
[04:01:47] <the_last> I tried $(this).siblings('.replycontrol').children('.replybutton') but that didn't work, which I thought it would
[04:02:17] <Cork> the_last: siblings("replycontrol") => siblings(".replycontrol") is correct for a starter
[04:02:27] <the_last> Sigh... I figured it out Cork, I was missing a "."
[04:02:28] <the_last> HAHAHA
[04:02:39] <the_last> The children one works
[04:02:58] <Cork> the_last: also i would prob use .find instead of .children
[04:03:06] <the_last> Okay :)
[04:03:07] <Cork> as it is less reliant on the dom structure
[04:03:22] <the_last> Thanks Cork
[04:03:24] <Cork> actually
[04:03:36] <Cork> $(this).closest('div').children('.replybutton')
[04:03:40] <Cork> opps
[04:03:42] <Cork> $(this).closest('div').find('.replybutton')
[04:03:51] <the_last> Even more efficient?
[04:04:00] <Cork> not much of a difference
[04:04:12] <Cork> but it is more flexible
[04:04:36] <Cork> i would personally prob even go as far as to use closest('form')
[04:04:36] <the_last> Fair enough. If I change the structure of my html that won't work hey?
[04:04:41] <the_last> Like for example if I added a div inbetween
[04:04:56] <Cork> $(this).closest('form').find('.replybutton')
[04:05:07] <Cork> that way it works as long as they are in the same form
[04:27:23] <lite_> >>>var entities['Type'].ShortName = "test"; var type = entities['Type'].LongName ? entities['Type'].LongName : entities['Type'].ShortName ? entities['Type'].ShortName : entities['Type'].Oid
[04:51:44] <Night-hacks> in this simple code my alert doesn't show !? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4321015fb38cc0560609
[04:52:32] <Night-hacks> anyone can help ?
[04:52:38] <ryez> Night-hacks: it errored?
[04:52:49] <Night-hacks> ryez: no
[04:53:27] <ryez> have you tried an error handler?
[04:53:44] <ryez> or just check the doc
[04:53:52] <Night-hacks> ryez: no i haven't
[04:54:32] <Night-hacks> ryez: when i remove the "json" parameter it works
[04:57:18] <ryez> good you fixed it yourself
[04:58:39] <Night-hacks> ryez: but i want json output.
[05:08:01] <Hooloovoo> Woah, quiet day.
[05:12:20] <MikeD_> i just got here, "what's goin' on?"
[05:12:59] <Hooloovoo> Not much it seems.
[05:13:32] <MikeD_> do you have a question or just commenting on the lack of traffic
[05:14:14] <Hooloovoo> Nah, i don't have one. I can come up with some question if you'd like?
[05:14:31] <brunoais> Hooloovoo, It's been quite busy, so don't complain
[05:14:33] <brunoais> well
[05:14:37] <brunoais> busy but fun ^^
[05:14:50] <Night-hacks> the function on this code doesn't call   https://gist.github.com/anonymous/111e974eea739da0e5ae
[05:15:06] <Night-hacks> can anyone help ?
[05:15:44] <Hooloovoo> Night-hacks: what does the network tab in dev tools say about it?
[05:17:13] <Night-hacks>  Hooloovoo:   /identification/step_two.json    type     application/json
[05:17:23] <Night-hacks>  Hooloovoo: i even have the response
[05:17:47] <Hooloovoo> Night-hacks: That's strange. No errors in the console?
[05:17:57] <Night-hacks> Night-hacks: no error
[05:21:01] <Hooloovoo> Night-hacks: What jquery verison?
[05:23:13] <Night-hacks> Hooloovoo: i'm using jquery-rails
[05:40:29] <usrb1n> Hello guys, can somebody please guide me to solve my problem ? I am a PHP developer and recently I have started to learn about user interfaces (something that I always wanted to know but I always was the 'back guy', behind my console just writting code on a black window). So I want to make a nice user interface for an internal application and I want the users to be able to upload a file.
[05:40:42] <usrb1n> I have found jqueryfileupload
[05:40:48] <usrb1n> And I couldn-t use it
[05:40:58] <usrb1n> So I have found a little guide based on this, http://runnable.com/UZKDAYo3XEw2AACX/how-to-upload-a-file-using-jquery-for-php
[05:41:08] <usrb1n> But I still can-t understand where can I define where my files goes ?
[05:41:20] <usrb1n> How can I write the cod to inspect the uploaded file content ?
[05:41:34] <usrb1n> As I see there, the handler only checks for the errors
[05:43:33] <usrb1n> Oh nevermind, just found it :)
[06:00:03] <rcw2> why when i hit ctrl+shift+r on this page in firefox, http://tinyurl.com/qyhknbw does the slideshow not work as wanted, but hitting f5 fixes it
[06:02:05] <brunoais> checking
[06:04:10] <brunoais> rcw2, $(window).load(function() {
[06:04:10] <brunoais>     $('#splashscreen').fadeOut('slow');
[06:04:10] <brunoais> });
[06:04:11] <brunoais> what?
[06:04:14] <brunoais> why?
[06:05:28] <brunoais> 3 jQuery! Combo breaker!!! :D
[06:10:55] <rcw2> brunoais, ive removed that, but i think the issue may still appear
[06:11:03] <rcw2> after ctrl+shift+r
[06:11:50] <brunoais> what is the issue, rcw2 ?
[06:12:06] <brunoais> what is "not working as wanted"?
[06:12:09] <brunoais> what is wanted?
[06:13:01] <rcw2> brunoais, the actually image in the slideshow might stretch to twice the height until hitting f5
[06:13:10] <rcw2> after ctrl+shift+r
[06:14:06] <brunoais> rcw2, for me, it opens and closes
[06:15:23] <rcw2> opens and closes?
[06:16:13] <usrb1n> Where can I find all attributes (like name, size...) of file selector?
[06:16:43] <brunoais> usrb1n, what is a file selector?
[06:17:11] <BillCriswell> Holy crap.
[06:17:32] <usrb1n_> brunoais: http://api.jquery.com/file-selector/
[06:17:35] <BillCriswell> Just realized something so simple that's I'm offended I didn't think of it before.
[06:17:35] <brunoais> BillCriswell, what?
[06:17:45] <brunoais> BillCriswell, what? What?
[06:17:48] <BillCriswell> brunoais: Just a "duh" moment.
[06:17:52] <usrb1n_> I need to see if I can get the number of lines the file has automatically.
[06:17:58] <BillCriswell> brunoais: Using pseudo elements for tooltips lol
[06:17:59] <usrb1n_> When the file is uploaded
[06:18:17] <brunoais> BillCriswell, :D
[06:18:38] <Baako> hi guys. I have a textbox in which users can write whatever they want. The problem with this is that when you post a link it doesn't happen as an hyperlink. Is they a way i can use jquery to make sure that anything with a ".com" comes up as a hyperlink e.g. google.com       or www.google.com
[06:18:42] <brunoais> usrb1n, huge tip: avoid jQuery-specific CSS selectors
[06:19:12] <brunoais> usrb1n, in that case, it's right there in that page what it "maps" to
[06:19:45] <brunoais> usrb1n, do you know what you are getting when you use that selector?
[06:20:11] <brunoais> Baako, example please. jsfiddle
[06:20:51] <Baako> brunoais i haven't try anythign yet as i dont know how to come about this. I
[06:21:27] <Patteh> can anyone help my with this JS function please
[06:21:28] <Patteh> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Gympo
[06:21:37] <brunoais> Baako, what is the act of posting a link?
[06:21:48] <Patteh> I am utilising a smooth scroll function for moving between anchor links
[06:22:10] <Patteh> and I want to add an offset if the window width is below a certain value
[06:22:37] <brunoais> Patteh, examples please
[06:22:47] <Patteh> as the navbar on the mobile site adds 165px offset
[06:22:51] <brunoais> place there rubbish and then the anchors
[06:23:11] <Baako> brunoais e.g. lets say for an example. You have a text field. basically if you copy and pasta OR driectly type in www.google.com this should automatically be clickable link when you post it.
[06:23:15] <drej> Patteh all of those things are css things
[06:23:18] <drej> use media queries
[06:23:19] <brunoais> I only see leftover;"forgotten" js
[06:23:28] <drej> to adjust your layout based on the display size
[06:24:03] <Baako> brunoais another example will be for a blogging side. if you make a post or comment on a post and in it they is a url. It should make this clickable to another user
[06:24:05] <brunoais> Baako, in a text field or in an editable DOM element?
[06:24:34] <brunoais> I mean, a DOM element with contentEditable
[06:24:39] <Baako> brunoais google.co.uk
[06:24:47] <Baako> brunoais www.google.co.uk
[06:24:59] <Baako> you see it has make that link clickable
[06:25:36] <brunoais> Baako, regex?
[06:27:48] <Night-hacks> can anyone help me on this ? the alert method doesn't calls              https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4a40cf04abea3dc1b9c1
[06:29:01] <dwarder> Night-hacks: jsfiddle it
[06:29:02] <brunoais> Night-hacks, not enough info
[06:29:08] <brunoais> ^
[06:29:43] <Night-hacks> it's my url : http://localhost:3000/identification/step_two.json
[06:29:54] <Night-hacks> which returns  :  {heeeeey: true}
[06:30:23] <Night-hacks> but jquery getJson()  can't get the out put
[06:31:30] <shoky> Night-hacks: {heeeeey: true}   is not valid JSON
[06:31:50] <Night-hacks> shoky: how come ?
[06:32:01] <shoky> {"heeeeey": true}   is valid
[06:32:08] <shoky> because json.
[06:32:25] <Night-hacks> shoky:  i'll change it to yours
[06:32:47] <shoky> Night-hacks: in any case, add an error handler to the ajax request
[06:33:17] <shoky> and use console.log not alert ;\
[06:33:46] <shoky> also if the url is step_two.json  shouldn't you be requesting that?

[06:37:53] <Anticom> http://jsbin.com/bozorupo/11 I'm animating the transitions for better looks
[06:38:03] <Anticom> now i don't get my animations chained somehow
[06:38:11] <Anticom> could someone please take a look and help me out? :)
[06:38:36] <Night-hacks> shoky: i changed the json and now the method is being called
[06:39:16] <Night-hacks> shoky: how can i get the response from data argument ?
[06:39:38] <shoky> Night-hacks: data.heeeeey
[06:40:25] <Night-hacks> shoky:  what if i don't know the 'key' in key.value part ?
[06:42:14] <Night-hacks> shoky:  thank you, i really appreciate your help
[06:42:14] <RobW> Does anyone know if this is possible? http://imgur.com/DijyFrg
[06:43:09] <guest____> why can't i append to a jquery generated div? http://paste2.org/a5VGNg0U (by class)
[06:44:07] <shoky> Anticom: put one animation in the "complete" callback of the other if you want to chain them (on separate elements)  http://jsbin.com/bozorupo/12/edit
[06:44:34] <Anticom> shoky my problem was using this instead of _this/self (being previously set from an outer scope)
[06:44:54] <shoky> yeah
[06:45:51] <shoky> guest____: you can. if its not working for you make a minimal jsfiddle of the problem
[06:45:57] <Anticom> shoky http://api.jquery.com/animate/ 3rd param on .animate is easing. or can 3rd argument if of type function be the callback aswell?
[06:46:24] <shoky> Anticom: parameters in [] are optional, so you can put the callback as 3rd
[06:46:39] <Anticom> okay
[06:46:45] <Anticom> thought the order had to be right tho
[06:46:50] <shoky> it does
[06:47:16] <Anticom> added the ease to my class anyway :D
[06:47:25] <Anticom> shoky thank's for the hint :)
[06:47:34] <shoky> yw
[06:48:04] <RobW> Does anyone know if this is possible? http://imgur.com/DijyFrg
[06:49:11] <shoky> if it's the same color as what's directly behind it... isn't it transparent?
[06:51:52] <RobW> shoky: yes, that's the problem
[06:52:01] <shoky> lol.
[06:52:03] <RobW> I'd like to use a negative color (i'll figure this out lateR)
[06:52:19] <RobW> basically, whatever color is directly behind the menu icon dictates what the icon color will be
[06:52:36] <shoky> and if there are many colors behind it?
[06:52:59] <RobW> well.. if this is JS-based, then perhaps it can detect multiple colors (one for each line-position)
[06:53:07] <RobW> otherwise, whatever is close should suffice
[06:53:12] <Patteh> drej: the problem is my nav slides down and add's a 165px offset, then slides closed again. I cannot add an offset using CSS without breaking the entire design
[06:53:26] <shoky> anyways doesn't seem easily possible for general background that can have anything
[06:53:36] <Patteh> I need to allow for it in the scrolling function based on the width of the window
[06:53:37] <RobW> true. i've never seen it done ;)
[06:53:49] <logikos> jus tmake the icon (or whatever is 'on top' with a transparent or translucent background
[06:53:51] <drej> Patteh yes, thats what media queries do.
[06:53:52] <Patteh> or delay the animation
[06:54:07] <RobW> logikos: that is one solution, but not the solution I'm looking for!
[06:54:08] <logikos> useing rgba() or a png with some opacity set to less than 1
[06:54:32] <RobW> (that's actually the solution we're using right now).. but we're experimenting with different UI tests
[06:54:35] <Patteh> adding a 165px offset in css will result in all the content being 165px further dwon the page
[06:54:43] <Patteh> the offset is only present while the navbar is open
[06:54:52] <Patteh> which is for a second after click
[06:54:56] <BillCriswell> Might be able to look into background-blend-mode... sure the support for that is awesome.
[06:54:59] <Patteh> then it is gone
[06:55:32] <Patteh> infact BillCriswell here helped me yesterday with the function to calculate window width
[06:55:33] <brunoais> background-b what?
[06:55:36] <logikos> RobW not sure i understand what you want then ... sorry
[06:55:41] <Patteh> i just cannot interface it with the scrolling function
[06:55:53] <BillCriswell> brunoais: So new adobe shit.
[06:55:55] <BillCriswell> Some*
[06:56:00] <BillCriswell> brunoais: http://css-tricks.com/basics-css-blend-modes/
[06:57:27] <RobW> BillCriswell: I've seen that a while back - looks pretty neat, too bad it's not widely supported yet :(
[07:03:33] <aboudreault> What would be the reason that jquery (2.0) doesn't set the x-requested-with header on a $.ajax call?
[07:05:15] <shoky> aboudreault: is it a cross-origin request
[07:05:47] <aboudreault> Yes.
[07:06:01] <aboudreault> shoky, should I simply add it myself for cross-origin request?
[07:06:23] <BillCriswell> RobW: http://jsbin.com/ziseworu/1/edit?css,output am I thinking about this right? Just the fixed one would actually get the background of the div behind it?
[07:06:26] <shoky> aboudreault: for CORS you have to have a header in the response that allows this header
[07:06:37] <shoky> aboudreault: e.g.  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With
[07:07:19] <aboudreault> oh, that's probably what it fetch with the OPTIONS just before..
[07:07:58] <shoky> yes, you have to have that header in the OPTIONS response
[07:08:11] <aboudreault> shoky, thanks a lot. will check in that direction
[07:08:22] <RobW> BillCriswell: that would be the usual solution, but it doesn't help the contrast
[07:08:42] <BillCriswell> Right, but I just set it up like that to make sure I understand.
[07:09:01] <RobW> Yup - it's correct.. but we'd be using it for a menu button and maybe a logo
[07:09:28] <krambiorix> i want to have a dropdown panel like facebook has when you click on the globe icon or the messages icon... How can i do that?
[07:10:27] <shoky> $('#dropdown').show()
[07:10:38] <Patteh> BillCriswell might you be able to help with why this will not work correctly please?
[07:10:41] <Patteh> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Gympo
[07:10:57] <Patteh> its the solution you gave yesterday mixed in with the smoothscroll function from css-tricks
[07:12:17] <krambiorix> shoky, but how to put it on the top of the page?
[07:12:24] <BillCriswell> Damn, can't spare some HTML and CSS?
[07:12:52] <shoky> krambiorix: css
[07:14:52] <BillCriswell> Patteh: What's the issue with this?
[07:15:13] <Patteh> it kills the smoothscroll function
[07:15:30] <ra9> hi there! i whould like to know if is it possible to load jQuery to other global variable different to jQuery on browser ?
[07:15:31] <Patteh> i jsut want to conditionally add 165px based on window width being above or below 500px
[07:16:33] <ra9> I need to load on specific jQuery's version on my page, but my cms using an old version(1.2.6)
[07:16:44] <Patteh> instead of animating it just jumps directly to each one
[07:17:00] <RobW> Patteh: works for me
[07:17:07] <RobW> make sure you have jquery loaded
[07:17:31] <RobW> Patteh: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/aAjHf?editors=101
[07:17:44] <Patteh> 1.9.1 loaded
[07:18:06] <RobW> Check console
[07:19:01] <Patteh> okay i have the smoothscroll working now, missing ;
[07:19:15] <Patteh> but the offset isnt added when width is sub 500
[07:21:49] <star_prone> I have an ajax request that return an array on multiple levels; I store the array inside a javascript variable; I iterate the javascript object with .each() in order to print the response on the page (the key, and its value); my problem is that some of the keys will contain other javascript objects so the output will be [object Object]
[07:22:23] <star_prone> is there a recursive function that will print the array and not [object Object]?
[07:22:49] <star_prone> smth similar to PHP's print_r(), if someone know it
[07:22:52] <star_prone> thanks
[07:23:07] <xec> just do console.log() ?
[07:23:23] <BillCriswell> Patteh: You want to subtract.
[07:23:33] <airdem> var data = new FormData($form[0]); will include all form data (textinput, select, fileupload) ?
[07:23:47] <xec> star_prone: you can see the output in the console, usually F12
[07:23:56] <airdem> no need to merge with $form.serializeArray(); right?
[07:24:09] <BillCriswell> Patteh: Just modified a demo from earlier to smooth scroll http://jsbin.com/ziseworu/2/edit?js,output
[07:24:09] <star_prone> I need to embed the response on the page
[07:24:25] <star_prone> I know I can see it in the console's log
[07:27:40] <Patteh> BillCriswell, subtract was the answer
[07:27:50] <Patteh> ty for the help
[07:27:52] <Patteh> i'm blind
[07:28:32] <BillCriswell> Patteh: http://jsbin.com/ziseworu/3/edit?js,output You can automatically grab the height of the nav as well.3
[07:28:52] <xec> star_prone: depends on what you want - you could try JSON.stringify() ?
[07:31:10] <star_prone> xec: that is a good idea, thanks!
[07:31:20] <BillCriswell> Patteh: No problem!
[07:31:27] <star_prone> xec: I also found the same thing googleing the problem
[07:31:38] <Patteh> nice though on the auto grab for the nav too
[07:31:40] <Patteh> tyvm
[07:34:47] <StephenS> Should I make a responsive website or to have two websites, such as m.url.com and url.com (for desktop) ?
[07:35:05] <aboudreault> shoky, after verification..  The allow headers response of my OPTIONS call: Access-Control-Allow-Headers:x-requested-with, content-type, accept, origin, authorization, x-csrftoken
[07:35:22] <aboudreault> but jquery doesn't add the header
[07:35:31] <BillCriswell> StephenS: I prefer responsive.
[07:36:19] <aboudreault> looks like I have to set it manually: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8163703/cross-domain-ajax-doesnt-send-x-requested-with-header
[07:36:36] <StephenS> BillCriswell do I need jquery mobile when I already have responsive web page?
[07:36:38] <airdem> should firebug display all form data if i do this: console.log(new FormData(this)); in side the form.submit() event function?
[07:37:04] <shoky> aboudreault: oh heh.. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/xhr.js#L62-L66
[07:37:31] <BillCriswell> StephenS: Don't believe so.
[07:37:48] <BillCriswell> StephenS: You wouldn't need jQuery Mobile unless you needed jQuery mobile.
[07:38:05] <aboudreault> shoky, looking in the code is always a good thing :)
[07:38:15] <StephenS> yeah because my page is not responsive :(
[07:38:26] <StephenS> that's why I'm thinking about jQuery mobile and m.url thing
[07:38:41] <StephenS> But I can just rewrite my current style.css and add media queries and make it responsible.
[07:41:31] <RobW> BillCriswell: I've come up with a different solution
[07:41:35] <RobW> Thanks for attempting ;)
[07:42:01] <BillCriswell> RobW: No problem! I kind of actually stopped trying a while ago haah
[07:42:34] <RobW> It was actually a really simple solution, check here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rxqDu
[07:43:00] <RobW> now there's always contrast!
[07:45:03] <BillCriswell> I was thinking you wanted the color completely inverted.
[07:45:19] <RobW> BillCriswell: I did, to pull out contrast.. but then we thought about it again..
[07:45:26] <RobW> check out http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rxqDu (changed it). contrast is never lost
[07:45:26] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[07:48:52] <TeckniX> anyone handled touch events from iOS via jquery?
[07:49:07] <TeckniX> it seems that my mouseover is triggered but not my touchstart/end/etc
[07:50:19] <RobW> TeckniX: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4755505/how-to-recognize-touch-events-using-jquery-in-safari-for-ipad-is-it-possible
[07:50:56] <TeckniX> RobW: I have something similar but with an element targeted
[07:51:09] <TeckniX> I’ll try that code and narrow it down
[07:52:24] <star_prone> xec: stringify is ok, meaning that it will show the information but this will be as a json string
[07:52:28] <star_prone> xec
[07:52:36] <star_prone> xec: is there another option?
[07:56:40] <RobW> TeckniX: you can use a different selector.. such as $("#element")[0].addEventListener
[07:57:26] <RobW> I'd suggest using some sort of plugin, like http://jqtjs.com/
[08:10:27] <aboudreault> I had a global beforeSend for my ajax requests. But it looks it is not called if there is some code that also has a beforeSend parameter per request.
[08:10:34] <TeckniX> thanks RobW I’ll look into it
[08:10:36] <aboudreault> what's the proper way to handle this?
[08:27:53] <wb_twerp> do you use media queries and then have fixed size boxes/layouts ?
[08:28:17] <wb_twerp> or is there something else, i.e. i just want to make sure that my page doesn't get a scrollbar
[08:30:48] <beancurd> overflow:hidden?
[08:30:59] <beancurd> then your content will get clipped.
[08:32:50] <BillCriswell> It amazed me how differently anything can be approached by two different people.
[08:34:03] <wb_twerp> beancurd: i think media queries would be way to go because you'll have to specify heights..
[08:34:44] <wb_twerp> think of 4 div siblings, 3rd being the only variable length
[08:35:10] <wb_twerp> the only way to make 3rd variable/flex height is by specifying max-height
[08:35:28] <wb_twerp> and that means you need specifics
[08:35:43] <beancurd> oh, i thought you meanth you didn't want any scrollbars. horizontal/vertical.
[08:35:59] <Getty> BillCriswell: i think thats a bit topic related ;) css, html and js is always just a bunch of combined workarounds ;) everyone picks different ones
[08:36:15] <beancurd> Getty: it's hacks all the way down :)
[08:36:36] <Getty> beancurd: if you have a non workaround orientated environment, it leads up to pretty identical results
[08:36:40] <BillCriswell> Getty: Yeah. I'm looking at some CSS right now and it just... feels totally wrong, but it's doing what it should. It's just impossible to work wwith.
[08:37:03] <Getty> beancurd: a good example (never said good result) is Java.... its literally impossible that several people come to a different OO design for specific situations
[08:37:24] <beancurd> Getty: ain't nobody got time fo' dat.
[08:37:26] <Getty> BillCriswell: for me as non designer, its ALL just impossible to work with ;)
[08:37:35] <Getty> beancurd: hahahahhahahaha yeah but i just wanted to prove the point ;)
[08:38:08] <BillCriswell> I can code and design a bit so I'm usually OK looking at other people's CSS, but not this time.
[08:38:13] <Getty> BillCriswell: really, i love that fact that i can MAKE css "well enough" for most needs, but if it once was touched by a designer i cant change it anymore, whatever i do it all falls apart
[08:38:24] <beancurd> yeah, but in an ideal world, front end stuff would be nice and well structured, and everyone would use less/sass and be happy.
[08:38:32] <BillCriswell> Getty: Exactly. It feels like it's going to topple over.
[08:38:36] <Getty> beancurd: less/sass is already a workaround
[08:38:45] <Getty> beancurd: in real the css itself should be just fucking working as you tell it todo ;)
[08:39:13] <BillCriswell> beancurd: This is using scss and it's not helping, actually making it worse in this case. Original designer was very overly specific.
[08:39:22] <beancurd> yeah, but it's a good workaround that makes it more programatically accessible.
[08:39:41] <beancurd> BillCriswell: hate the player, not the game :)
[08:39:51] <BillCriswell> Haha I know.
[08:40:07] <BillCriswell> The implementation, not the technique.
[08:40:11] <beancurd> in other news, i'm quitting my job.
[08:40:38] <beancurd> and going freelance-ish fultime-ish.
[08:40:52] <BillCriswell> Well, overly specific CSS selectors should be illegal. This scss is easily 15 levels deep at parts.
[08:41:03] <beancurd> haha...
[08:41:05] <BillCriswell> beancurd: I would be a terrible boss for myself.
[08:41:15] <thinkontheclock> That's one of the worst pitfalls of sass/scss
[08:41:19] <beancurd> inCSSeption.
[08:41:32] <thinkontheclock> At the beginning: nest everything!
[08:41:40] * thinkontheclock looks at compiled CSS
[08:41:44] * thinkontheclock barfs
[08:41:50] <beancurd> BillCriswell: i dunno, i don't know any other boss who i'd feel comfortable with giving me a handjob.
[08:42:08] <BillCriswell> beancurd: haha
[08:42:24] <BillCriswell> thinkontheclock: Over specificity is the devil.
[08:43:05] <beancurd> as a self-taught person, overly smart css bothers me.
[08:43:13] <thinkontheclock> BillCriswell, agreed. pretty much defeats the purpose of the cascade.
[08:43:28] <beancurd> like daisy chained < ~ : + crap.
[08:43:58] <BillCriswell> beancurd: Absolutely. If your CSS selectors are complex you're probably doiong something weird haha.
[08:44:22] <beancurd> s/weird/you hate the next person who has to touch your code
[08:44:56] <beancurd> so.. i'm supposed to give 2 weeks notice..
[08:44:59] <Jattenalle> beancurd, well that dirty pig shouldnt be messing with my precious code!
[08:45:00] <Jattenalle> :P
[08:45:02] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, CSS selectors should be as simple as possible.
[08:45:03] <beancurd> do i.. give in on a friday.. or monday.
[08:45:20] <Jattenalle> beancurd, monday, saves you a day!
[08:45:26] <Jattenalle> because who would go in the last monday
[08:45:33] <dnano91> hi, i have a <select multiple> and when an event is triggered i want to update the <option>'s. how can i do this (i have a list with new values), so it removes the ones not included in newList and adds from newList the ones currently not shown?
[08:46:13] <dnano91> i want to preserve the selected values
[08:46:39] <beancurd> well the net effect is really the same, either way, it'll be 10 working days before I can leave. I suppose i don't want to give my managers the weekend to brood over the shitlist of jobs that they'll want me to do during my final 2 weeks.
[08:46:40] <krambiorix> if i want to select everything except a div with class 'mydiv' , how should i do that?
[08:46:56] <beancurd> you can't.
[08:47:53] <beancurd> you can do $("div:not(.mydiv)")
[08:48:00] <beancurd> cuz this is #jquery
[08:48:24] <MikeD_> what about :not(.mydiv)  ?
[08:48:42] <beancurd> in css?
[08:49:17] <beancurd> $("div").not(".mydiv") would work too.
[08:49:18] <DeltaHeavy> You could have 2 CSS selectors with 2 seperate rules
[08:49:29] <DeltaHeavy> * { ... } div.mydiv { ... }
[08:49:33] <beancurd> docs recommend it over :not
[08:49:35] <DeltaHeavy> Where the second one cancels everything out from the first.
[08:49:53] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Why do you need to do that?
[08:49:58] <DeltaHeavy> It seems disgusting though, and it sounds liek there's bad design afoot here.
[08:50:24] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i have a dropdown panel where i can fill in a form. When the user clicks somewhere out of the panel, i want to hide it
[08:51:03] <beancurd> huh.
[08:52:16] <krambiorix> i think i found it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1403615/use-jquery-to-hide-a-div-when-the-user-clicks-outside-of-it
[08:53:45] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Here's how I'd approach that based on what you told me: $(document).on('click', function (e) { var $target = $(e.target); if ($target.closest('.panel').length === 0) { /* Hide Panel */ } });
[08:53:54] <DeltaHeavy> krambiorix: Yeah, this is why it's best to ask the root of your question, rather than some janky road you've gone down to find out it wasn't a good way to go about it in the first place :p
[08:54:04] <BillCriswell> Oh, close.
[08:54:30] <krambiorix> DeltaHeavy, true
[08:54:55] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, but when i click on an input field in that panel (div) , the panel hides ....:s
[08:54:58] <duch_kazatel> gooooooood morning folks.
[08:55:08] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Yeah. Use this answer instead: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16470315/191226
[08:55:15] <BillCriswell> It's closer to the one I showed you.
[08:55:18] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: AYyyyyyy
[08:55:29] <Elirips> Hm, I'm looking at some source, from which I think it uses jquery context menu, but it uses some option 'preDisplay: function() { .. }' and I cannot find that in the docs? Anyone knows if preDisplay is something of jquerys context menu? and where the doc would be?
[08:58:20] <duch_kazatel> Elirips what plugin is it and what are you trying to do?
[08:59:19] <Elirips> duch_kazatel: I dont know what plugin it is
[08:59:28] <Elirips> how do I find out
[08:59:35] <duch_kazatel> where are you seeing this, then?
[09:00:11] <Elirips> duch_kazatel: I need to fix something in code not written by me, not documented, and the person who should know is out of hosue
[09:00:34] <BillCriswell> Elirips: How do you expect us to figure this out? lol
[09:00:56] <duch_kazatel> how is the code invoked?  as a method on a jquery object?
[09:00:58] <Elirips> BillCriswell: Well, I hoped someone could tell me: "Yes, preDisplay is a property of jquery context menu version xy
[09:02:00] <Elirips> does this look like jquery context menu? http://pastebin.com/dLGCV3Rb
[09:03:38] <duch_kazatel> Elirips that's a pretty vague code snippet imo.  how do you invoke this code?
[09:06:30] <Elirips> duch_kazatel: never mind, I'll jus tgo home. a) I'm a C++ programmer and not js, b) I'm getting so pissed when looking at the code
[09:06:45] <duch_kazatel> Elirips uh, it shouldn't be that hard, but ok.
[09:07:03] <BillCriswell> Elirips: I rage at some code too.
[09:07:16] <Elirips> duch_kazatel: there is not a single line of comment, there is no doc what libs are used, no hints where to find the doc of the libs, etc.
[09:07:22] <dnano91> anyone?
[09:07:26] <the_voice-> hi all anyone ever experience fileReader momentarily freezing the browser while uploading a picture to be previewed?
[09:09:51] <duch_kazatel> Elirips meh. decently written JS shouldn't usually need many comments, and if the code is reasonably idiomatic it should be easy enough to figure out what plugins are in play.
[09:09:58] <duch_kazatel> but i could see where your frustration is coming from.
[09:10:25] <Elirips> yeah, and I'm hungry too
[09:10:30] <DeltaHeavy> Comments are underrated IMO. I comment the hell out of everything.
[09:11:08] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy comments are important on occasion.  but i'd rather no comments than too many, or fewer instead of inaccurate.
[09:11:21] <DeltaHeavy> Why would you rather no comments than too many?
[09:11:27] <duch_kazatel> breaks code flow.  i can read :)
[09:11:30] <DeltaHeavy> And yeah, inaccurate comments are counter-productive
[09:11:49] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, but comments make things a lot more clearer, especially if another programmer looking at your stuff isn't as good as you or framilliar with some of yoru methods.
[09:12:27] <duch_kazatel> Clean Coding would disagree with you :)
[09:13:01] <Elirips> Well, it depends. What I expect from a function with many parameters, is either a comment, or at the very beginning some code that is easy to read and that tells me what is required, what is optional, and what type is expected, if the function cant handle arbitary types
[09:13:41] <duch_kazatel> your problem is the first part of that statement - "a function with many parameters"
[09:14:39] <duch_kazatel> javascript's lack of real overloading/real optional arguments (i know you can munge them, but still) and its type system both lend themselves to not creating functions with tons of arguments.
[09:14:39] <MikeD_> how do you feel about the term "dirty" to indicate a form has uncommitted data?  seems like something leftover from VB devs who were once dumb terminal developers
[09:15:12] <Jon47> MikeD_: I think it comes from unix
[09:15:27] <duch_kazatel> i'd say "dirty" to mean "unvalidated", but i'm not oldschool like that.
[09:15:34] <NoiseEee> i think angular uses that
[09:16:27] <Jon47> a file might have a "dirty" bit or flag to indicate it's been modified but not saved
[09:16:31] <MikeD_> i say dirty to mean contains dirt
[09:17:06] <Jon47> you might just as well call it "unsaved"
[09:17:09] <Jon47> if you prefer
[09:17:23] <Jon47> or "modified"
[09:18:15] <Elirips> well, even if a function has only one parameter, how should I know if it must be an object, an array or a simple type?
[09:18:43] <duch_kazatel> really depends on your company's standards.  i'
[09:18:50] <duch_kazatel> *i'm generally able to infer by looking at the code.
[09:18:53] <duch_kazatel> and other uses.
[09:19:10] <MikeD_> Elirips: why do you need to know that?
[09:19:15] <duch_kazatel> but i could see why that would be confusing to others.
[09:19:44] <Elirips> MikeD_: Because here I have a function that has a parameter named 'ids' and no, it does not expect an array of ids, but a comma-separated list of ids
[09:19:47] <Elirips> for whatever
[09:20:04] <duch_kazatel> probably because it passes it onto a jquery selector.
[09:20:44] <MikeD_> oh, in the case where you are trying to play well with others' code, i can see where their lack of convention or documentation is frustrating
[09:20:45] <Elirips> and I would expect something like 'assert(ids is_list_of_strings)' at the very beginng
[09:21:26] <MikeD_> nah, if the developer had the discipline to check types, they'd have left you some clue via naming convention or a decent comment.
[09:21:33] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:21:43] <MikeD_> mostly you'll just get a nice error for doing it wrong
[09:21:45] <duch_kazatel> clean coding is worth a skim for that kind of stuff.
[09:21:52] <MikeD_> or an ugly error (as is the more likely case)
[09:23:12] <Elirips> MikeD_: yes, an error that is catched at the very last place
[09:25:12] <MikeD_> haha, you catch errors?  my former employer just let them go to the user so they could call and report them :)
[09:25:27] <MikeD_> ... part of the reason they're now a former employer.
[09:25:36] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[09:25:38] <duch_kazatel> that's pretty bad.
[09:25:58] <duch_kazatel> we can't let backend errors cascade out to our frontend, so we're super careful about that.
[09:29:18] <TeckniX> got it all working - thanks guys. Looks like mouseover and mouseout on iOS are triggered before any clicks. If they alter the dom, then no further events are triggered. Aka your mouseover will cancel the click for iOS devices
[09:33:13] <BillCriswell> Man... I hate when something I do a lot seems to not work.
[09:33:28] <BillCriswell> For some reason text-indent: -9999px seems to not be working.
[09:33:28] <duch_kazatel> right?
[09:33:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's even worse when it's something I shouldn't be able to fuck up ahah
[09:34:28] <BillCriswell> DUH
[09:34:35] <duch_kazatel> figure it out?
[09:34:43] <BillCriswell> text-align: right; would totally render that useless.
[09:34:51] <duch_kazatel> welp
[09:35:14] <BillCriswell> That was kind of funny.
[09:35:29] <duch_kazatel> i had that not too long ago with font-color
[09:35:52] <BillCriswell> Yeah, something that should exist but doesn't.
[09:36:43] <BillCriswell> Recently brad frost tweeted about how to get bullets in a list a different color from the text. That would have come in handy haha.
[09:37:00] <BillCriswell> Well, he wanted to know how to accomplish it without clever CSS.
[09:38:25] <duch_kazatel> aaah.
[09:39:07] <BillCriswell> color effects border color and font color, but there's a border-color and not a front-color, just seems weird.
[09:39:23] <BillCriswell> font*
[09:39:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah it's one of those inconsistencies that's always bothered me.
[09:45:28] <duch_kazatel> the mootools $ is a terrifying beast.
[09:47:41] <TheWhisper> hey guys
[09:47:51] <TheWhisper> I have this if statement: if((width >= 778 && window.location.pathname.indexOf('index') === -1) || (width >= 778 && window.location.pathname.indexOf('/') !== 0)) {]
[09:48:08] <TheWhisper> the first part works when used alone and the second part works when used alone
[09:48:16] <TheWhisper> but when I try to use them together, they don't work
[09:48:27] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: && instead of ||
[09:48:33] <TheWhisper> I want it to be OR
[09:48:45] <nhulea> yo!
[09:48:46] <TheWhisper> basically
[09:48:51] <binaryclock> does anyone know of any good jquery irc chat website modules?
[09:49:16] <TheWhisper> if the width is greater than 778 AND the URL does not contain 'index'
[09:49:18] <TheWhisper> OR
[09:49:32] <TheWhisper> if the width is greater than 778 AND the url contains just a /
[09:50:06] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper could you fiddle what you're doing.
[09:50:25] <MikeD_> TheWhisper: i suggest you set a variable inside some gauntlet of conditions you're checking, then put the work inside if( myFlag ){ }
[09:51:03] <rocky> anyone using intern to test code that uses jquery? when i "require" jquery from node i get TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of undefined
[09:51:08] <MikeD_> it will simplified your logic a lot (probably) and make it easier to extend with a new condition
[09:51:45] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ ++
[09:55:47] <ngharo> TheWhisper: search for both paths in one test: window.location.pathname.match(/(index|\/)/)
[09:56:29] <ngharo> add ^ and $ to that to be more strict
[09:56:36] <MikeD_> heh, because regex is much easier to maintain :)
[09:57:07] <ngharo> you're assuminging a simple condition is hard to maintain to begin with
[09:57:33] <TheWhisper> http://jsfiddle.net/6BdzD/
[09:57:47] <MikeD_> yeah, I like to write regex, i just don't like to read regex.
[09:58:31] <TheWhisper> whoops
[09:58:32] <TheWhisper> http://jsfiddle.net/6BdzD/1/
[09:58:34] <TheWhisper> updated
[09:58:34] <MikeD_> as long as it is accompanied by a decent comment, use it.  (the poor maintenance programmer you are saving might be you)
[09:59:17] <duch_kazatel> cache $(window) btw
[10:01:00] <ngharo> TheWhisper: http://jsfiddle.net/6BdzD/3/
[10:01:25] <TheWhisper> I cached $(window) but now it says that "window.resize(function() {}" is not a function...
[10:02:06] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6BdzD/4/ i'd do something like this at least.
[10:02:09] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: #header is more specific than .header ;)
[10:02:44] <TheWhisper> Good point, my actual CSS is #headerWrapper.headerLeft
[10:02:59] <TheWhisper> I just didn't type the first part on the fiddle
[10:03:23] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Your code works.
[10:03:38] <TheWhisper> I don't know, it didn't work for me
[10:03:44] <TheWhisper> ngharo's regex does though
[10:03:48] <BillCriswell> It works for you too.
[10:03:55] <TheWhisper> nope :P
[10:04:51] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: http://jsfiddle.net/6BdzD/7/ didn't change anything besides the CSS.
[10:05:38] <BillCriswell> Here's how I was thinking: http://jsfiddle.net/6BdzD/8/
[10:05:56] <TheWhisper> Yeah, the pathname stuff may work there on the fiddle
[10:05:58] <TheWhisper> but it didn't on my site
[10:06:00] <BillCriswell> Oops: http://jsfiddle.net/6BdzD/10/
[10:06:19] <doug65536> TheWhisper: use .on('resize', function() { })
[10:06:26] <TheWhisper> Why?
[10:06:51] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Do you mean to be using path.indexOf('index') > -1 ( meaning you want it to be true if the word index is in there )
[10:07:36] <TheWhisper> I want the function to NOT run if width is >= 778 AND (path is 'index' OR path is just '/')
[10:08:38] <doug65536> !window.location.pathname.indexOf('/') === 0    <-- that is always false
[10:08:58] <doug65536> use !== and remove ! at the start
[10:09:29] <doug65536> ! is right associative. a bool is never === 0
[10:10:19] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Why did you ask for the opposite thing?
[10:10:58] <TheWhisper> I did?
[10:11:08] <TheWhisper> Oh, I guess I didn't specify that I wanted it to not run if those were true :P
[10:11:47] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:12:27] <TheWhisper> My bad
[10:12:43] <BillCriswell> Whatever you're doing. You should probably be using media queries anyway.
[10:13:41] <BillCriswell> <body class="page-index"> and some media queries and you can accomplish this without touching JS and watching resize events.
[10:14:04] <duch_kazatel> ++
[10:15:26] <BillCriswell> The first time I put a class on the body to signify what page you're on it blew a couple coworkers minds haha.
[10:15:28] <tfittsy> if I have an html attribute like <div id="initData" data-init="{url: url,data: data,success: success,dataType: dataType}"> is there a way I can do something like $.ajax($('#initData').data('init'));
[10:15:36] <BillCriswell> I thought it was a common thing to do.
[10:17:24] <duch_kazatel> tfittsy you'd have to parse $('#initData').data('init') first.
[10:17:32] <duch_kazatel> unless you want to ship it as a string.
[10:17:49] <BillCriswell> Might have to eval that haha
[10:18:04] <duch_kazatel> tfittsy but if you want to configure an ajax call that way, you need to parse the object first.
[10:19:08] <duch_kazatel> though I wouldn't do that to begin with tbh.
[10:19:08] <shoky> if it was valid json, .data() would parse it for you.. but good luck putting a success function in json
[10:19:27] <gx> I'm having an issue with a jq ui dialog box. Whenever I click to resize it, it adds padding and/or shrinks the div within it. anyone run into anything similar? not much on google about it
[10:19:54] <tfittsy> I'm trying to use FullCalendar and I need to populate it.  I wish it could just pull the data from html tags but I'm not seeing where.  I don't really want to hack it like this.
[10:20:02] <shoky> gx yeah sounds familiar
[10:20:13] <Nyekon> Hello everyone, question... Anyone know a way to delay the scrolling of an iframe from the parent?
[10:20:16] <duch_kazatel> tfittsy pop your data into an object on the page instead.
[10:20:17] <doug65536> tfittsy: JSON.parse($.ajax($('#initData').data('init'))
[10:20:18] <gx> shoky any idea if there's a fix for that? it's really weird
[10:20:42] <doug65536> BUT NO. actually that won't work
[10:20:48] <BillCriswell> Haha yeah, it's not JSON.
[10:20:50] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 it was pointed out that .data('init') should automatically parse it as an object.  i was wrong >:)
[10:21:04] <doug65536> $.ajax doesn't return the response either
[10:21:07] <BillCriswell> It'll parse JSON I believe, but not just a JS object.
[10:22:32] <shoky> gx: this is what i was thinking of  http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8932
[10:22:45] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/buqed/1/edit
[10:23:00] <gx> shoky that seems siimlar , yeah
[10:23:01] <shoky> gx: and if that's the issue you're having i don't know of a fix
[10:23:12] <shoky> open bug
[10:23:20] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell aaaah.  good point
[10:23:22] <jwmann> I'm using this technique for detecting input value changes, and it works fine ( http://stackoverflow.com/a/5917358/185731 ) however I'm using an autocomplete/typealong and this techinique doesn't detect the change when I choose something from the autocomplete menu (and it inserts it into the original input) is there someway I can modify this so it detects these changes as well?
[10:23:57] <shoky> gx: well, except to not use box-sizing: border-box on the resizable
[10:24:12] <gx> i'm not using anything at all at this point
[10:24:17] <gx> and it's still happening, really odd
[10:24:24] <gx> shoky: http://screencast.com/t/cLtupasDHNK
[10:24:52] <shoky> are you sure you don't have box-sizing set anywhere?
[10:25:04] <TheWhisper> hey, how can I take one of the values that I have a red dash next to: http://i.imgur.com/B6V8Q2N.png
[10:25:06] <gx> maybe that's set in jq ui css somewhere, let me check
[10:25:10] <TheWhisper> and send them to a variable
[10:25:27] <TheWhisper> like var varName = currentTarget (something like that, but that doesn't work)
[10:25:36] <duch_kazatel> the8thbit event.currentTarget and event.target
[10:25:37] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: They're a part of the object.
[10:25:37] <shoky> gx nah they wouldn't set it, its the cause of the bug
[10:25:41] <BillCriswell> of the event*
[10:25:54] <BillCriswell> Think I meant to type event object.
[10:25:55] <shoky> i mean, after the bug is fixed maybe they'll set it
[10:25:59] <BillCriswell> That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
[10:26:05] <TheWhisper> Okay
[10:26:08] <TheWhisper> how do I access them?
[10:26:41] <gx> shoky: i don't see box-sizing set on any of the theme's css
[10:26:49] <gx> and it's defintely not set on the div itself, inline or otherwise
[10:26:51] <duch_kazatel> the8thbit inside the handler, pass the event - .on('event', function(event){ /* event is the object you want */ });
[10:26:55] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: What have you tried?
[10:26:59] <duch_kazatel> woops, meant TheWhisper
[10:27:14] <shoky> gx: then i guess you're encountering a different issue
[10:27:52] <gx> gotta be something to do with this bootstrap theme. i'm going to test with just blank html to see if it still happens
[10:28:17] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking about going back to sitting, at least temporarily.
[10:28:47] <TheWhisper> whoops gotta go
[10:29:07] <shoky> gx: i see in bootstrap 3 it uses box-sizing: border-box for everything by default
[10:29:14] <gx> ahh
[10:29:18] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper - http://jsfiddle.net/3qrnK/1/ :)
[10:29:51] <BillCriswell> currentTarger
[10:29:55] <BillCriswell> currentTiger
[10:30:07] <lemd> is there a channel for finding js/jquery contractors or would this be it?
[10:30:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/3qrnK/2/
[10:30:11] <doug65536> TheWhisper: anyway... $.get(url, null, 'json').done(function(response) { }) is how I suggest doing it
[10:30:31] <jwmann> Man two of my favorite IRC heros are here, duch_kazatel and BillCriswell xP
[10:30:32] <duch_kazatel> lemd try maybe ##freelance or something?
[10:30:41] <duch_kazatel> jwmann "irc heros" that's awesome.
[10:30:47] <doug65536> tfittsy: oops, anyway... $.get(url, null, 'json').done(function(response) { }) is how I suggest doing it
[10:30:50] <duch_kazatel> i've been a little less involved lately.
[10:30:51] <elmcrest> Hi everybody. Can I use $(".class").hide() depending on if a css background-image is loaded?
[10:30:51] <jwmann> :P
[10:30:53] <BillCriswell> Yeah, as if I could feel any cooler.
[10:30:59] <jwmann> Lol xD
[10:31:06] <gx> shoky: i hardcoded box-sizing:content-box on the div, and now it's making the div *bigger* on every resize. haha
[10:31:21] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest you're have to check the .css('background-image') on them first.
[10:32:36] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel tha background image is on a different class ... maybe something like this?  $(".class").css('background-image').(".class2").hide()
[10:32:49] <gx> shoky:  i'm just fixing it by automatically resizing the div w/ jquery using the dialog resize callback
[10:32:59] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest wut
[10:33:07] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest you check to see what's applied to the element.
[10:33:12] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel hehe don't slap me :D
[10:33:17] <gx> shoky: not my preferred method, but it works
[10:33:20] <duch_kazatel> fiddle up an example.
[10:33:59] <wb_twerp> what's the relation between max-height and scrollbar ?
[10:34:26] <wb_twerp> do I not get scrollbar upto max-height ? i.e. if content is rendered upto max-height I don't get scrolls ?
[10:35:03] <BillCriswell> wb_twerp: Might need to reapproach that one.
[10:35:19] <duch_kazatel> wb_twerp yeah that question is kind of weird.
[10:35:26] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel ... I'm not sure what you mean ... should I make an example?
[10:35:37] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ elmcrest
[10:35:38] <b-ot> elmcrest: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:35:54] <elmcrest> ahh I see ^^
[10:41:04] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel ... I'm really a noob I guess ... anyway, something like this http://jsfiddle.net/zys8b/
[10:42:05] <duch_kazatel> you want to hide $(".preloader").hide(); when bg-img has finished loading?
[10:43:01] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel I want to hide the .preloader when the background-image is actually loaded ...
[10:44:12] <Uhkis> if that even possible without ajax
[10:44:21] <duch_kazatel> it is, in fact :)
[10:44:29] <elmcrest> nice :)
[10:44:56] <elmcrest> a workaround which works would fit my needs, too...
[10:44:57] <duch_kazatel> i'd check the load event and see if that gets you started.
[10:45:21] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel did I mention that I'm not so experienced with js/jquery ^^?
[10:45:34] <duch_kazatel> are you interested in learning?
[10:45:59] <elmcrest> yes of course ... but I was hoping there is a simple solution... nobody can learn everything
[10:46:13] <duch_kazatel> i'm not expecting you to learn everything.
[10:46:34] <duch_kazatel> what part of that statement was confusing to you?
[10:46:46] <elmcrest> check the load event :)
[10:47:05] <elmcrest> but I guess I can google that
[10:47:34] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel maybe this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3537469/jquery-detect-when-image-has-loaded ?
[10:47:34] <lemd> any freelancers that are well versed with node/js/jquery shoot me a message, looking for experienced guys for a longer term project on a music startup similar to soundcloud (but more logic and complexity)
[10:48:30] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest look up .on()
[10:48:38] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel k, thx
[10:48:41] <duch_kazatel> lemd wrong room for that
[10:49:11] <lemd> oh sorry
[10:49:36] <duch_kazatel> lemd i think there's a ##freelancers or something.
[10:49:38] <t432> I'm trying to get this infiitescrolling plugin to work (https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll/blob/master/Readme.md). It t should trigger an ajax call to the server on page load (correct?) , which is not happening.  What have I missed?  (line 27 onwards)
[10:49:40] <t432> http://pastebin.com/cBjZpT1U
[10:49:46] <lemd> yeah like 8 guys in it :/
[10:50:02] <lemd> is there a decent site online to find jquery guys the usual odesk style wesbtei
[10:50:03] <duch_kazatel> lemd this is a jquery help channel, not really a recruitment channel.
[10:50:27] <lemd> * unlike odesk
[10:51:29] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest it's probably pertinent to ask why you want to do that.
[10:52:26] <drej> lemd why jquery specifically ?
[10:52:39] <drej> rather than something more full-fledged like angular or backbone
[10:52:49] <duch_kazatel> lemd sound slike you want full-stack JS devs, not just frontend.
[10:53:11] <lemd> node.js api, with a jquery/js frontend...need more help on the frontend
[10:53:12] <BillCriswell> Yeah. We're the front-end guys, the pretty boys.
[10:53:18] <BillCriswell> and ladies*
[10:53:29] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel yes of course ... there is a little css animation which is loaded faster than a couple - up to 10 background images. since I can't (I mean, I cannot, not jquery cannot) load the images async I just let the user wait for the images. but the animation keeps spinning in the background, which is useless and consumes power on mobiles ... and is visible when fading from one image to another
[10:54:23] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest that sounds... hacky.  but here's one solution: http://jsfiddle.net/zys8b/2/
[10:55:36] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel sadly I don't have a img tag ... all imgs are css background-imgs
[10:55:45] <duch_kazatel> reread the code ;)
[10:55:51] <drej> BillCriswell youre a lady?
[10:55:54] <duch_kazatel> that creates an IMG tag for you and loads the image into it.
[10:56:37] <t432> anyone?
[10:56:48] <BillCriswell> drej: I am not.
[10:56:49] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest and actually, this will be a little better performance-wise: http://jsfiddle.net/zys8b/3/
[10:56:56] <drej> BillCriswell are you _sure_ ?
[10:56:57] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest it's considered rude to PM without checking first btw ;)
[10:57:08] <BillCriswell> You can never be 100% sure really.
[10:57:23] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel yes I know - that's why I apologized ... but I guess I don't want that link public ^^
[10:57:27] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest you need to inject the IMG tags like that and load the images into them so you canuse the load event.
[10:57:30] <duch_kazatel> *can use
[10:57:44] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest look at the code I linked and let me know what you're confused about.
[10:58:00] <BillCriswell> drej: My girlfriend would be super confused if I turned out to be a lady.
[10:58:26] <duch_kazatel> i feel like i need to listen to "dude looks like a lady"
[10:59:26] <BillCriswell> I'd be an unfortunate looking woman.
[10:59:31] <drej> lol
[10:59:43] <duch_kazatel> hah
[11:03:39] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel ok ... maybe this code places somewhere a img, loads it and afterwards hides the .preloader div? and set's a bg-img to a div ... which in my case is already set so that step would be redundant I guess...
[11:04:41] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest look at the css change ;)
[11:04:51] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest you have to remove the background-image from your css.
[11:04:55] <duch_kazatel> and set it this way.
[11:05:20] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel and jquery set's the property after the image is loaded?
[11:05:36] <elmcrest> that sounds a unlogically to me
[11:05:39] <duch_kazatel> yep - that's the .css() part.
[11:05:40] <elmcrest> +bit
[11:05:52] <elmcrest> ah
[11:06:26] <elmcrest> with the img tag the request is fired and jquery kind of links it to the div
[11:06:41] <duch_kazatel> don't link anything anywhere.
[11:07:00] <duch_kazatel> you're watching the "load" event on that img - load waits for everything to finish, including image downloads.
[11:07:14] <t432> Cork: around?
[11:07:43] <Cork> sure, what's up?
[11:07:57] <duch_kazatel> elmcrest when that load has finished, you're adding a background-image to the appropriate div.  the browser should load the image from cache.
[11:08:43] <elmcrest> yes ok, I did unterstand it now ... I try to glue it to my page
[11:08:47] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel thx
[11:08:49] <t432> I'm trying to get this infiitescrolling plugin to work (https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll/blob/master/Readme.md). It t should trigger an ajax call to the server on page load (correct?) , which is not happening.  What have I missed?  (line 27 onwards)
[11:08:50] <t432> http://pastebin.com/cBjZpT1U
[11:08:55] <t432> Cork: ^
[11:09:21] <t432> Cork: you on twitter?
[11:09:25] <Cork> no
[11:09:31] <t432> dayum. nvm
[11:11:32] <Cork> t432: never used the plugin, but i suspect you need to play with the different Selector options
[11:11:52] <Cork> it prob needs them to find what url to use for the next page to fetch
[11:12:36] <t432> i tried various combinations. nvm
[11:29:14] <elmcrest> duch_kazatel It works ... kind of - doesn't bring the benefit I hoped it does, anyway my wife wants some time from me, so I have to try again tomorrow. thx again for your help so far...
[11:29:40] <wormmd> For $.ajax(settings), can I use the status and success/error properties in tandem, i.e., define behavior for status codes, and an error function to handle request timeout?
[11:34:16] <simpleuser> Hi there. The name of my input is app_word[status]. This does not work : "$('input[name=app_word[status]]').on('change', function(){". Error: "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[name=app_word[status]] ". Any idea ?
[11:35:09] <BillCriswell> simpleuser: Quote the name or escape the [ and ].
[11:35:21] <simpleuser> Tried \[status\]
[11:35:23] <simpleuser> no success.
[11:35:26] <BillCriswell> input[name='app_word[status]']
[11:36:37] <simpleuser> Oh. No error with "app_word[status] :)
[11:36:41] <simpleuser> Thanks
[11:36:54] <BillCriswell> No problem... Weird though I assumed the escaping would work.
[11:42:24] <wormmd> For $.ajax(settings), can I use the status and success/error properties in tandem, i.e., define behavior for status codes, and an error function to handle request timeout?
[11:42:55] <rindolf> wormmd: let me see.
[11:43:00] <duch_kazatel> use .done() and .fail() instead - the old callbacks will eventually get deprecated.
[11:44:27] <jwmann> I have array with a single array in it, How do I strip the outer array since it serves no purpose?
[11:44:46] <duch_kazatel> myArray = myArray[0]; maybe?
[11:44:54] <jwmann> That's what I was think :P
[11:45:01] <simpleuser> Shouldn’t this work ? http://jsfiddle.net/h27Th/
[11:45:08] <wormmd> duch_kazatel: if I do .fail(), I have to manually parse out status for handling, which, while not monumentally difficult, is still an annoyance.
[11:46:09] <duch_kazatel> wormmd you should use .done() and .fail() because success, error, and complete are deprecated.
[11:47:18] <simpleuser> I’m trying to show or hide divs according to the selected radio button
[11:47:28] <wormmd> I'm talking about the settings hash one would pass to $.ajax(). Are those the same as $.ajax().success() and .error()
[11:48:09] <duch_kazatel> wormmd the success and error properties on the config object you pass to $.ajax() are technically deprecated afaik.
[11:49:57] <simpleuser> Anyone ?
[11:50:19] <duch_kazatel> simion314_ wha3t's your question?
[11:50:22] <duch_kazatel> err, simpleuser
[11:51:14] <simpleuser> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/h27Th/1/
[11:51:31] <simpleuser> Trying to hide or show divs according to radio buttons
[11:51:46] <duch_kazatel> okay.  what's your question?
[11:51:56] <simpleuser> Not working. Don’t know why ;)
[11:52:11] <NoiseEee> simpleuser: hide() not hide
[11:52:21] <NoiseEee> etc
[11:52:22] <duch_kazatel> and no need for a switch in this case.
[11:52:40] <simpleuser> Oh, great !
[11:52:42] <simpleuser> Thanks :)
[11:53:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/h27Th/3/ - also, avoid using attribute selectors when possible.
[11:53:43] <simpleuser> ok thanks :)
[12:01:49] <asturel_> hi, ihave a little issue with jeditable.. when i edit inplace and click to ok i get this in the input: <form><textarea name="value" style="height: 24px; width: 637px;"></textarea><button type="submit">OK</button><button type="cancel">Cancel</button></form>
[12:01:50] <asturel_> any idea?
[12:04:14] <rindolf> asturel_: what's the problem?
[12:04:15] <asturel_> somehow the form bugs into the input
[12:05:06] <asturel_> http://puu.sh/8EoxD/eccc60b080.png like this
[12:06:42] <asturel_> this is the code what i use http://pastebin.com/iSKCqe49
[12:13:50] <asturel_> rindolf?
[12:14:03] <rindolf> asturel_: no idea.
[12:14:06] <asturel_> :(
[12:14:13] <rindolf> asturel_: can you paste a self-contained example?
[12:14:19] <asturel_> self contained?
[12:14:21] <rindolf> asturel_: what you have now is very partial.
[12:14:32] <rindolf> asturel_: yes, self-contained and reproducing.
[12:14:44] <asturel_> that pastebin code doesnt good?
[12:14:49] <asturel_> isnt*
[12:14:53] <t4nk673> Hello
[12:15:12] <t4nk673> Has anyone used JSC3D before?
[12:15:22] <rindolf> asturel_: it's only part of the page, and there's no <script src="..." statements.
[12:15:47] <wormmd> duch_kazatel: so parsing the status codes out of the jqXHR in .done() or .fail() is a must, then. I guess it's no different than passing a hash in. Oh well.
[12:18:26] <duch_kazatel> wormmd btw you mean "object" ;)
[12:19:34] <wormmd> duch_kazatel: probably.
[12:20:42] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/vqvY8/1/ Could someone help me figure out how to make it so that if the A element has the .active class than it will set the div.filefield-source-s3_file_search css to display:block?  I think that I am close.
[12:21:40] <margot_> Hi
[12:21:46] <duch_kazatel> phelix .css("display", "block");
[12:21:59] <asturel_> rindolf well i minify the html so its not rly readable if i paste it :/
[12:22:06] <margot_> can I have some extenal point of view for an use case ?
[12:22:07] <duch_kazatel> phelix also, use just the ID - don't prepend it with the tagname
[12:22:08] <rindolf> asturel_: what? Why?
[12:22:43] <rindolf> margot_: hi.
[12:22:51] <rindolf> margot_: what is the use case?
[12:22:53] <asturel_> i mean its auto by nodejs

[12:24:47] <relipse> I'm trying to define a style and its still showing up yellow
[12:24:59] <duch_kazatel> err, rockyrock
[12:25:14] <rockyrock> duch_kazatel: ?
[12:25:28] <duch_kazatel> rockyrock http://jsfiddle.net/, instead of pastie.
[12:25:53] <margot_> rindolf: there is not plugin to do someone like this ? (I was thinking so but didn't found, so my alternative are tabs or radio button ?)
[12:26:11] <rindolf> margot_: OK.
[12:26:20] <rindolf> margot_: you should be able to hack something.
[12:26:30] <phelix> duch_kazatel: It seems that is what I am doing except that I had a# in there.
[12:26:48] <duch_kazatel> phelix right - remove the a part.
[12:26:53] <phelix> i did
[12:27:01] <relipse> Can someone help with qtip2 library, I'm trying to create my own style like ti says using style: classes, but it is not working
[12:27:03] <phelix> still does not work
[12:27:08] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/vqvY8/2/
[12:27:21] <duch_kazatel> phelix right, you want .css("display", "block")
[12:27:23] <duch_kazatel> not .css("display:", "block")
[12:27:27] <duch_kazatel> remove that colon
[12:27:36] <margot_> rindolf: what is better way in your pov ?
[12:27:59] <rindolf> margot_: what is sp BTW?
[12:28:01] <phelix> ah ok there we go
[12:28:02] <phelix> thank you
[12:28:10] <duch_kazatel> rockyrock also, you're not waiting for document ready.
[12:28:25] <margot_> or easier
[12:29:15] <rindolf> margot_: well, you can make this code more modular.
[12:29:28] <margot_> rindolf: sp, var, al are all button, or thinking than the user click
[12:30:18] <margot_> s/thinking/something sorry
[12:30:27] <asturel_> rindolf http://pastebin.com/VUMfAX03 the jeditable code is in settings.js
[12:30:36] <phelix> duch_kazatel: It still isn't working on my page. But I think the reason why is there is some other jquery where that a element is normally not set to active. But once you click on it, it changes to active. Is there a way to have this so it will notice the change when that link is clicked on?
[12:30:47] <duch_kazatel> phelix huh?
[12:31:08] <duch_kazatel> what is "active"?
[12:31:26] <rindolf> asturel_: /javascripts?
[12:31:28] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Normally there are a few <a links. and there is other jquery. so when the page loads active does not exist on that a element
[12:31:42] <phelix> but when you click that a element then the active class is added
[12:31:45] <duch_kazatel> phelix so you want this code to run when the element gets the active class?
[12:31:49] <phelix> yes
[12:31:53] <duch_kazatel> you need to change your code.
[12:31:59] <duch_kazatel> so that it runs this logic, then.
[12:32:03] <duch_kazatel> because you can't "watch" elements.
[12:32:08] <asturel_> rindolf yes, why?:D
[12:32:08] <phelix> ahh
[12:32:09] <duch_kazatel> well, you can, but it's extremely slow.
[12:32:31] <rindolf> asturel_: well, how am I supposed to deploy it?
[12:32:34] <phelix> what is best function to do for this?
[12:32:42] <phelix> how can the jquery tell that the active class has been added?
[12:32:47] <rindolf> asturel_: the code should be self contained - one HTML file or so.
[12:32:52] <duch_kazatel> phelix in your event handler that adds it...
[12:32:59] <asturel_> uhm sorry :D
[12:33:14] <rindolf> asturel_: maybe set up a page with it on a web site.
[12:33:18] <phelix> hmm, that jquery I had didn't have an event handler in it did it.
[12:33:32] <duch_kazatel> phelix no.  you said other code adds the active class, right?
[12:33:37] <duch_kazatel> because that's where you need to make your changes.
[12:33:45] <phelix> ya
[12:33:59] <phelix> I can't modify their jquery though, I have to find a way to do this on a seperate script
[12:34:25] <phelix> would I have to add like an on.click instead of a hasclass active?
[12:34:47] <duch_kazatel> phelix you're going to run into race conditions.  who is "they"?
[12:39:11] <phelix> Sorry, I wrote a module that integrates into their module so they already have some jquery that hides these elements. I was hoping I could just add the correct classes and it would hide and unhide my item to. Let me see if I can show you a jsfiddle with everything
[12:42:04] <rockyrock> the value of <p> doesn’t get changed, even tho when I clicke on http://0.0.0.0:8080/call it returns a text correctly. http://jsfiddle.net/T3T6W/
[12:42:20] <duch_kazatel> woah
[12:42:39] <duch_kazatel> rockyrock let me correct this fiddle for you.
[12:42:47] <rockyrock> duch_kazatel: thanks
[12:43:01] <duch_kazatel> rocky your format is wonky btw :)
[12:43:27] <rocky> duch_kazatel, mispell name? :)
[12:43:39] <duch_kazatel> dammit why are there two of you :(
[12:44:13] <rockyrock> duch_kazatel: I’m very new to javascript and jquery. even tho I’m a professional java and python programmer :p
[12:44:24] <duch_kazatel> rockyrock that's fine.  i'll show you what you need to do.
[12:44:30] <rockyrock> that’s great :)
[12:44:55] <doug65536> rocky: what is $get    shouldn't that be $.get
[12:45:01] <doug65536> rockyrock: ^
[12:45:08] <duch_kazatel> lol doug65536 did it too!
[12:45:15] <rockyrock> I have no idea. I just want to do ajax :p
[12:45:24] <duch_kazatel> rockyrock http://jsfiddle.net/T3T6W/1/
[12:45:48] <doug65536> lol
[12:46:05] <rockyrock> lol!!!
[12:46:09] <rockyrock> that was so difficult
[12:46:10] <rockyrock> hahahah
[12:46:19] <duch_kazatel> rockyrock read the docs for $.ajax() and use that instead.
[12:46:24] <rockyrock> ok
[12:46:27] <duch_kazatel> you'll learn a little more that way.
[12:46:28] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: why
[12:46:42] <rockyrock> is it necessary to add a semicolon?
[12:47:04] <duch_kazatel> rockyrock there are rules about ASI - learn them and decide for yourself.
[12:47:12] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 imo learn $.ajax() and then use the convenience methods when appropriate.
[12:47:20] <rockyrock> ASI?
[12:47:22] <doug65536> rockyrock: do this though http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/T3T6W/3/
[12:47:26] <duch_kazatel> automatic semicolon insertion
[12:48:07] <duch_kazatel> rockyrock in javascript, there are rules about when the engine will insert semicolons for you.  you can technically write a lot of code without semicolons.
[12:48:17] <rockyrock> ok

[12:49:00] <ophi-491> what does the $ mean
[12:49:06] <duch_kazatel> jQuery
[12:49:18] <ophi-491> what about in php
[12:49:27] <rockyrock> listen to this and enjoy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06cvLKfShO0
[12:49:28] <duch_kazatel> Dunno.
[12:49:35] <doug65536> ophi-491: are you asking what line 1 of my fiddle means?
[12:49:47] <ophi-491> no i just mean in general
[12:50:08] <doug65536> technically it's a function, $ and jQuery both refer to the same function
[12:51:23] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 depends on the language :)
[12:51:47] <doug65536> bye, lol
[12:51:56] <ophi-491> do you know any php ircs? or can i ask questions here in the future
[12:52:02] <ophi-491> channels*
[12:52:30] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 ##php or #php ?
[12:52:32] <rindolf> ophi-491: there's ##php and ##programming
[12:52:32] <duch_kazatel>  one of those two.
[12:52:48] <rindolf> ophi-491: $ in PHP introduces a variable.
[12:52:58] <rindolf> ophi-491: both for lvalue and for rvalue.
[12:53:21] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/vqvY8/13/
[12:53:48] <phelix> this is the jquery that its using. I am having a feeling its not working in the jsfiddle because of the Drupal.behaviours function at the top of it.
[12:53:51] <duch_kazatel> wooooah
[12:53:57] <duch_kazatel> wayy too much.
[12:54:03] <phelix> not sure this will be anything you can do anything with
[12:54:07] <ophi-491> rindolf: duch_kazatel: ty
[12:54:10] <duch_kazatel> phelix nope.
[12:55:15] <rindolf> ophi-491: you're welcome .
[12:55:17] <phelix> well what would you thnk the best way to be to write my own js that will tell if .active gets added to an area and if so then set the css to this div
[12:55:35] <phelix> should I just try to use a on.click you think?
[12:55:39] <duch_kazatel> phelix let's flip all this - what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[12:56:01] <phelix> when you click on the link at the top of those items. You can see it in jsfiddle
[12:56:12] <phelix> it hides the elements or shows depending on which you are clicked on
[12:56:19] <phelix> basically like a small little quick tabs
[12:56:33] <duch_kazatel> okay, and this plugin doesn't have any kind of callback?
[12:56:41] <MikeD_> tgt.children('footer').children('button').foo()  vs.  tgt.find('> footer > button').foo();     which one would you rather I use?
[12:56:57] <duch_kazatel> the second, MikeD_
[12:57:07] <duch_kazatel> depending
[12:57:20] <MikeD_> depending on ?
[12:57:33] <duch_kazatel> convention in the file.
[12:58:33] <duch_kazatel> also: y'all should envy me - I get to dump through over 140 files for every use of $ to see if it's jquery or mootools.
[12:59:01] <phelix> duch_kazatel: for php it does. this is how I have integrated everything in. All that is working. Just need to figure out how to include this in the hide / show depending on if the item is clicked or not. I really think that it may be possible to do it with the existing js they are using I just need to add the correct class somewhere.
[12:59:49] <duch_kazatel> phelix you're munging a solution ;)  what's the basic structure you're dealing with?
[12:59:54] <duch_kazatel> of the HTML I mean.
[13:01:03] <duch_kazatel> because I'd bind a delegated listener on the parent that waits for a click to happen, then runs .find() for the element with the 'active' class added.
[13:02:15] <duch_kazatel> it's still hacky, but may be a little more reliable than what you're doing.
[13:02:23] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Its in the html section on that jsfiddle
[13:02:59] <duch_kazatel> phelix I wanted to avoid reading it :) i'm lazy.  but look at my suggestion and go from there.
[13:04:12] <decx> i'm nearly done with my client aquisition week. just need to shoot a few people in the street and drive over kittens and i can go through tomorrow as well without losing my mind
[13:04:27] <duch_kazatel> decx not the kittens!!!
[13:05:04] <decx> cold aqusition opens up a world of peril and human garbage and ignorance :>
[13:05:16] <MikeD_> decx: to be sure, shoot them in the head not in the street
[13:06:58] <decx> but then they don't suffer :(
[13:07:45] <wormmd> Can I reliably catch a status code of 0 for $.ajax() timeouts, a la: http://jsfiddle.net/Pg3eV/1/
[13:10:31] <PheLe> Hi All. Does anyone experience with a fixed position div jumping when the page is loaded? especially if there are other jquery codes.
[13:16:12] <shoky> wormmd: better to catch it with an error handler
[13:16:36] <wormmd> shoky: fair enough.
[13:17:06] <shoky> i dont think timeout is the only way to get a status code 0
[13:17:15] <ophi-491> do I have to register or something to access #php or #programming
[13:17:58] <shoky> ophi-491 it's ##php and ##programming  and yes, possibly.  /msg nickserv help register
[13:18:46] <decx> what's with the double # anyway?
[13:19:36] <shoky> "Topical or Reference Channels"
[13:21:04] <decx> oh so it's just to show that the people contributing to php did not register ##php
[13:21:25] <shoky> i suppose
[13:21:42] <Galaxy_Stranger> Howdy Ho!  Anybody awake?  I have a JQueryUI Tooltip issue.
[13:21:42] <Galaxy_Stranger> I got the tooltip working correctly, but when I put in the html content, I can't pass parameters to a javascript function call in the onclick event.
[13:21:45] <decx> that's what i get from reading the freenode policies page. but it's still strange :>
[13:22:27] <shoky> good idea in theory... maybe... ;p
[13:29:02] <redmoss> What's the difference between the resulting objects if you do var a = $('.selector'); var b = $(a);
[13:29:11] <redmoss> They look similiar, but they're not quite the same?
[13:29:43] <redmoss> The first one has a prevObject property, for instance...
[13:29:48] <Galaxy_Stranger> you've daisy-chained them
[13:31:52] <duch_kazatel> the second one is a jquerified jquery object and is unnecessary.
[13:31:54] <redmoss> Sure, I was just interested in why they're slightly different - what happens to the resultant jQuery object when passed another jQ object rather than a string selector
[13:34:20] <Galaxy_Stranger> It's actually a copy of the function.  It's a separate function call under the hood, unless you used a pointer, which I'm not sure you can do with Javascript.
[13:34:52] <duch_kazatel> right - you're running a jquery object through the jquery contructor again.
[13:39:21] <shoky> redmoss they're slightly different because they were built in different ways. doing b = $(a) just copies a.selector and a.context into b,  and any elements/objects wrapped inside a
[14:30:31] <eip56> What is the best way to secure a php page that echos out json data for a ajax query?
[14:31:03] <NoiseEee> what do you mean by 'secure'?
[14:31:19] <NoiseEee> the quick answer is to give authorized folks an API key that PHP validates
[14:31:31] <duch_kazatel> and check the domain/ip
[14:33:07] <eip56> ok its just an admin panel but im echo ing out json data to retrieve via ajax. ANd im just wanted to make sure that page is secure
[14:39:11] <__joshua__> https + authentication + authorization
[14:39:40] <__joshua__> eip56: do users log in?
[14:39:55] <eip56> yes
[14:40:13] <eip56> i havent tried a redirect on it according to session validation yet
[14:40:14] <__joshua__> right, so you have some authentication.
[14:40:17] <eip56> ill try that
[14:40:29] <eip56> wasnt sure if the redirect would hurt the ajax query
[14:40:43] <__joshua__> javascript doesn't know about redirects
[14:40:53] <__joshua__> they just happen transparently
[14:40:56] <eip56> oh cool
[14:40:59] <eip56> thanks
[14:42:01] <atmatt> Yo. I'm using the jquery dragenter & dragleave events for a drag-n-drop file upload. When I change the display property of a div on drag, it flickers like all hell.
[14:42:18] <atmatt> I've tried visibility, and setting a negative left position: still flickers
[14:42:37] <atmatt> doesn't flicker w/ opacity change, but I can't have a fixed div laying over everything
[14:43:38] <ophi-491> does anyone have a link to an example website with php and js files
[14:44:39] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 huh?
[14:45:12] <ophi-491> im trying to figure out how everything interacts with eachother
[14:45:30] <ophi-491> and what can call what
[14:45:35] <duch_kazatel> atmatt that's probably because you're incurring redraws maybe?
[14:45:49] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 pretty easy - php outputs html.  js can interact with html.
[14:46:00] <duch_kazatel> js can also call the server for more html/js
[14:46:25] <ophi-491> so php can only call other php scripts?
[14:46:31] <atmatt> duch_kazatel: is there another property I can set that doesn't flicker redraws? I've even tried deleting the element and appending it to the body on drag
[14:46:31] <duch_kazatel> right.  php can't call js.
[14:46:40] <ophi-491> and js cant call php?
[14:46:57] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 js can call the server and php can respond, but that gets brokered through the server.
[14:47:08] <duch_kazatel> atmatt what display property are you setting?
[14:47:10] <atmatt> Google Drive does something very similar, and obviously theirs doesn't flicker. Hard to inspect element on a thing that disappears though.
[14:47:29] <atmatt> none and block
[14:47:40] <atmatt> on a fixed div
[14:47:44] <duch_kazatel> any reason to can use visibility: hidden; instead?
[14:47:49] <duch_kazatel> and visible?
[14:48:10] <atmatt> I tried and it flickers. Same w/ left:-9999px and left:0
[14:48:29] <duch_kazatel> atmatt not sure.  i'd end up googling.
[14:48:44] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 that make sense?
[14:49:00] <atmatt> Argh. The Googles didn't bring up much. I just figured someone in here might have ran into this before
[14:49:14] <atmatt> it's a fairly common event for file upload stuff
[14:49:20] <ophi-491> I think so I just have to see it
[14:49:32] <duch_kazatel> atmatt can you fiddle up what you're doing?
[14:49:44] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 which part?
[14:49:58] <atmatt> yeah, but it's probably exactly what you expect
[14:50:04] <duch_kazatel> might not be ;)
[14:50:37] <ophi-491> if you are at index.php can it execute functions from a .js file
[14:51:01] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 the browser can execute the js.
[14:51:05] <atmatt> duch_kazatel: here's using visibility. http://jsfiddle.net/eJXjm/
[14:51:51] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 you can have you HTML reference those functions, and they'll run in the browser, but PHP can't call JS.
[14:52:12] <duch_kazatel> atmatt i'm not seeing the flicker.
[14:52:20] <atmatt> whaaaaat
[14:52:22] <atmatt> what browser?
[14:52:25] <duch_kazatel> ff
[14:52:35] <atmatt> I've seen it on chrome, chrome canary, & safari
[14:52:55] <atmatt> hahah wow it works fine on FF
[14:52:57] <duch_kazatel> i see it in blink.
[14:53:10] <ophi-491> and the js function could request the server to load index2.php
[14:53:12] <duch_kazatel> oh i'll bet your bindings are all weird.
[14:53:23] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 right.
[14:53:54] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/eJXjm/1/ atmatt
[14:53:57] <duch_kazatel> your bindings are off.
[14:54:23] <atmatt> duch_kazatel: I could
[14:54:30] <atmatt> 've sworn I tried that
[14:54:39] <atmatt> I need dragleave too, though
[14:54:53] <duch_kazatel> atmatt just pointing out that's your problem.
[14:54:59] <atmatt> damn it's dragleave that makes the flicker
[14:55:10] <atmatt> but if you don't drop, it stays shown
[14:56:04] <atmatt> ok. found a SO thread. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12945307/jquery-drag-and-drop-flickering-on-hover-webkit-only
[14:56:21] <atmatt> those browsers trigger dragleave on every child element. Go figure.
[14:56:54] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[14:56:55] <duch_kazatel> there you o.
[14:56:57] <duch_kazatel> *go
[15:02:16] <shoky> atmatt: it makes sense. it's alternating between dragleave on window and on your .drop div
[15:03:40] <atmatt> shoky: yeah. Still very odd it applies to child elements on chrome/safari
[15:04:19] <shoky> events bubble up from children
[15:06:18] <shoky> atmatt: it's happening on firefox too
[15:06:29] <shoky> just the flicker is not visible there
[15:07:45] <duch_kazatel> wonder why
[15:07:50] <atmatt> shoky: oh. Weird. This sounds blog-post worthy, should anyone pull their hair out over it again
[15:08:33] <shoky> because:  The dragleave event is fired when a dragged element or text selection leaves a valid drop target.
[15:09:07] <duch_kazatel> oooooh.
[15:09:15] <shoky> you start dragging, so the drag event is fired, so you addClass and make the drop div visible
[15:09:18] <atmatt> and when the whole document (plus its children) is the droptarget
[15:09:21] <shoky> which causes a dragleave on window
[15:09:35] <shoky> then in response to that you remove the class, and it causes a dragleave on .drop
[15:09:37] <shoky> etc
[15:10:09] <atmatt> now, what I don't get, is why this only happens when things redraw. Before, I added a class that added a border.
[15:10:09] <shoky> atmatt: there are only 2 drop targets involved here
[15:10:11] <atmatt> No flicker there
[15:10:14] <shoky> #window and .drop
[15:10:22] <ophi-491> so if i wanted index2.php to contain a function that returns something, i  can use jquery ajax in index.php to do a get request?
[15:11:02] <shoky> atmatt:  showing the .drop div causes the dragged element to no longer be above #window
[15:11:07] <atmatt> shoky: yeah but those are children of the drop target so they go back and forth like you said
[15:11:10] <shoky> atmatt: so a dragleave is triggered on #window
[15:11:29] <duch_kazatel> ophi-491 as long as the function returns data or html that you could basically get with a browser, yes you can use ajax.
[15:12:15] <shoky> atmatt: who are children of the drop target
[15:13:01] <atmatt> shoky: anything on the page
[15:13:21] <shoky> huh
[15:13:52] <atmatt> just what you said — when one div appears, it counts as another dragleave, and then triggers the hide, which counts as another, etc
[15:14:30] <shoky> yeah but the only thing that has to do with children is that the dragleave on .drop bubbles up to #window
[15:14:44] <ophi-491> ok thanks, i want to use curl to get something and return that
[15:14:45] <shoky> if that's what you meant, then yeah ;p
[15:16:17] <atmatt> shoky: ah, yeah. Something like that.
[15:16:44] <atmatt> Thanks! Oh the DOM and its quirks
[15:17:00] <shoky> and btw, $("div").addClass  adds to both of those divs :P
[15:17:34] <atmatt> yeah that was probably a dumb selector to use for debugging
[15:17:57] <atmatt> in the app I'm using $(document) and just a $("#div-id")
[15:20:16] <NeO__o> Hi guys
[15:20:24] <atmatt> Hello Neo
[15:20:26] <NeO__o> I have a question: I have a little jQuery script (http://pastebin.com/1481fw56) that smoothly scrolls to different specified
[15:20:27] <NeO__o> divs currently to the top of the page (margin-top 0px). How do I modify the script that the scrolling stops at a top-margin of 150px,
[15:20:30] <atmatt> I've been looking for you
[15:20:31] <NeO__o> i.e. it doesn't scroll completely to the top?
[15:21:05] <duch_kazatel> NeO__o change it to instead scroll to an offset that is the offset().top - 150 of that particular div
[15:21:16] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:21:43] <NeO__o> Sorry, I'm a complete jQuery / Javascript noob; normally doing PHP...
[15:22:53] <duch_kazatel> back
[15:23:20] <duch_kazatel> oh nvm you're like 90% there - 'scrollTop': $target.offset().top - 150
[15:23:23] <duch_kazatel> try that.
[15:23:28] <NeO__o> That works: fantastic
[15:23:34] <NeO__o> thanks a lot
[15:23:36] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[15:23:48] <NeO__o> Didn't think that would be so easy... ;)
[15:23:59] <duch_kazatel> normally it isn't :)
[15:24:10] <NeO__o> I really need a jquery crash course... Thank you so much
[15:24:16] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com
[15:24:36] <duch_kazatel> that and some time learning JS will get you far.
[15:24:43] <NeO__o> duch_kazatel: I will check that out thanks
[15:25:11] <NeO__o> Amazingly friendly jQuery-community you have here, I have to say
[15:25:37] <NeO__o> If you are asking something in the PHP-channel your normally getting flammed asap.. hehe
[15:25:41] <duch_kazatel> hah.
[15:25:49] <duch_kazatel> we're pragmatists.  sometimes people don't know.
[15:25:52] <NeO__o> I'm positivly surprised
[15:26:04] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what that change did?
[15:26:44] <NeO__o> yes, it changed the offset to 150px as needed
[15:27:04] <duch_kazatel> yeah it removed 150px from it.
[15:27:59] <duch_kazatel> i have to download safari *shudder*
[15:37:01] <NeO__o> I have another little issue:
[15:37:11] <NeO__o> I have another jquery script (http://pastebin.com/WpSUzpTh) that adds a css-class to a menu-div in order to change it's appearance when
[15:37:12] <NeO__o> you scroll down the page (currently 650px).
[15:37:31] <NeO__o> This basically works, but I would prefer to add the css-class everytime the menu-div reaches a top-margin position of 75px.
[15:37:48] <NeO__o> How would I go about that?
[15:37:49] <__joshua__> top margin?
[15:38:38] <NeO__o> Well, everytime the div is 75px away from the top of the page, i.e. 0px
[15:39:15] <__joshua__> ah, you want the $("#service-nav") offset?
[15:39:28] <NeO__o> yes
[15:39:42] <__joshua__> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3714628/jquery-get-the-location-of-an-element-relative-to-window
[15:40:47] <NeO__o> __joshua__: thanks
[16:36:58] <_raul> hey guys, silly question: http://jsbin.com/jasokija/1/ .. i'm trying to get on a page the content of another page, which has a form. and i want to post that form, wait for the OK and then redirect. Apparently, after i submit the form, it redirects instantly. not sure why :(
[16:37:31] <__joshua__> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[16:37:34] <_raul> i've tried moving the always on the xhr ... but still redirects instantly
[16:37:58] <_raul> yeah, sorry
[16:38:21] <_raul> http://jsbin.com/jasokija/2/
[16:38:48] <_raul> ty __joshua__
[16:39:04] <__joshua__> you are setting window.location
[16:39:33] <_raul> well, yeah, parent.location. but that's not my problem. my problem is that window.location does not wait for the form
[16:39:50] <_raul> for the post i mean
[16:40:18] <_raul> so order should be: get, wait, show the data, data has a form, submit the form, wait, oncomplete => window.parent.location
[16:43:34] <ophi-491> _raul i think you are looking for xhr.onload and .promise()
[16:43:51] <_raul> i was thinking RIGHT now about promises, never used them though
[16:43:56] <_raul> but what about onload ?
[16:45:31] <ophi-491> nevermind probably just .promise
[16:45:43] <ophi-491> if the only problem is .location not waiting
[16:47:04] <_raul> yes, only problem is waiting
[16:47:08] <_raul> let me try with .when
[16:49:06] <ophi-491> _raul will something like this work http://jsbin.com/jasokija/3/edit
[16:50:20] <_raul> posted , waited, not redirected
[16:57:06] <_raul> grr, i get on post the  No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present ... wth ?
[16:57:21] <duch_kazatel> _raul are you allowed access to the API?
[16:57:37] <_raul> it's just a test script i made to test this thing
[16:57:48] <duch_kazatel> what server are you hitting?
[16:57:59] <_raul> i don't have this issue if i post direct, without all the things i'm doing :D
[16:58:04] <_raul> a local server.
[16:58:13] <duch_kazatel> "post direct" meaning not using AJAX?
[16:58:21] <_raul> ajax
[16:58:38] <_raul> wth, i did not saw this before . grrr
[16:58:56] <_raul> and my script runs though, as i get emails
[16:59:11] <duch_kazatel> that's a CORS issue, either way.
[16:59:18] <_raul> yeah
[16:59:30] <_raul> well, it will mainly be used for autoresponders posting and  so on
[16:59:32] <jtri> hello, is there a way to escape a string that preserves the white space in javascript?
[16:59:43] <_raul> so i assume the big guys don't have this problem
[17:01:14] <_raul> yeah, i just did a post to aweber, just fine. so i'll have to add the headers on my script to test. but now ... i still can't redirect after that post, bleah
[17:02:40] <duch_kazatel> you should be able to.
[17:03:13] <_raul> hmm, worked once i fixed the CORS
[17:04:54] <duch_kazatel> slightly OT: anybody here familiar with Akamai Blaze?
[17:08:18] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Googled it... sounds cool.
[17:08:35] <duch_kazatel> we're using it all ready, but i'm trying to figure out some more of its magic.
[17:09:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: How does this actually work? Not following it at all.
[17:11:01] <duch_kazatel> as fair as I can tell, they take your page, cache it, and optimize load order, etc.
[17:11:26] <daraand> This is an odd question, and I'm a bit new so maybe I don't know the name of the concept, but can I force the browser to NOT download something that is hidden? I have one page that shows different content depending on browser size. For the smaller screens I'd like those browsers to only download what's visible. Is that possible?
[17:12:04] <duch_kazatel> daraand yes and no.  you'd have to fundamentally modify how you're building your page.
[17:12:43] <daraand> Yeah? Would I need something to test the useragent? or something more indepth?
[17:13:49] <duch_kazatel> you have 2 options: the first (and one you SHOULD NOT DO) involves ripping all external references out, setting up your criteria, and then dynamically writing in your script tags/img tags/whatever.
[17:14:11] <duch_kazatel> the second (and the smarter one) is to check useragent and serve up the appropriate version of your site.
[17:15:29] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Is it expensive?
[17:15:38] <daraand> which would me routing people to different page using something like http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ to detect the agent?
[17:15:46] <daraand> why is the first one not a good idea if you dont mind me asking?
[17:15:55] <Grant_P> I want to have a dynamic table in my page which refreshes every X minutes. Would Jquery + json be the correct technologies to use here?
[17:17:02] <duch_kazatel> Grant_P ajax + whatever format you want, along with a settimeout
[17:17:11] <duch_kazatel> daraand because then you're using in-browser javascript to do a litle more than it should, unless you're doing all your templating in-browser.
[17:17:36] <daraand> I see, thanks :) well time to poke around and think about this
[17:17:59] <duch_kazatel> daraand what backend are you using?  any particular framework?
[17:18:16] <daraand> Joomla 3.2 with a heavily customize theme from yootheme
[17:18:34] <Grant_P> kazatel: I'm also interested to update one of the fields in the table, say for example a status. This would then cause an action to update the mysql db in the back end. Do you have any good examples of this? I'm just really not sure which combo of technologies i should be using.
[17:18:46] <daraand> running apache with php 5.3...something, cant remember off the to of my head
[17:19:19] <duch_kazatel> Grant_P you want AJAX.  jquery does a great job abstracting that away.
[17:19:31] <duch_kazatel> whatever format you want to use is fine.  spitting out JSON or HTML.
[17:20:34] <Grant_P> duch_kazatel: cool, any good examples / tutorials on this? I'm competent with Python already so i'll likely use this on the backend with some appengine.
[17:21:18] <duch_kazatel> Grant_P maybe on learn.jquery.com
[17:21:25] <duch_kazatel> at least for the ajax part.
[17:21:33] <duch_kazatel> or this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started
[17:22:50] <daraand> Well there are joomla plugins to detect mobile, thats a good first step :D
[17:23:12] <daraand> and I can redirect people to a different url.. fancy.
[17:23:18] <Grant_P> duch_kazatel: Ack, thanks.
[17:25:47] <duch_kazatel> daraand you could also just serve up different content, but i'd build a mobile version of your site and slap it on m.yourdomain.com
[17:27:23] <BillCriswell> Can't figure out what Javascript framework I want to commit too.
[17:27:34] <duch_kazatel> for what?
[17:28:05] <BillCriswell> to try and learn really well haha
[17:28:11] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[17:28:13] <duch_kazatel> backbone?
[17:28:15] <BillCriswell> I kind of have a start with Angular I should just stick with it.
[17:28:26] <daraand> thanks duch_kazatel :D
[17:28:34] <duch_kazatel> daraand sure
[17:29:01] <andrewanderson> so i want to customize the list that comes with jquery-ui, i'm using jquery-ui-rails.. where do i start?
[17:29:21] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson what do you want to customize?
[17:29:39] <andrewanderson> duch_kazatel: the list that comes with autocomplete
[17:29:59] <duch_kazatel> not following - what specifically are you trying to change?
[17:30:04] <duch_kazatel> styles?  functionality?
[17:30:08] <andrewanderson> oh, styles
[17:30:12] <duch_kazatel> then CSS.
[17:30:25] <duch_kazatel> just override it.
[17:30:40] <andrewanderson> hm
[17:30:47] <andrewanderson> not even sure which folder to put it into to override
[17:31:01] <andrewanderson> i'll google
[17:31:01] <duch_kazatel> in your styles folder.
[17:32:03] <duch_kazatel> don't modify the css that came with it.
[17:32:12] <duch_kazatel> create a new file, place it in your css folder, and go from there.
[17:35:39] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson really not that hard...
[17:36:07] <andrewanderson> trying to figure out the file name
[17:36:20] <duch_kazatel> name it whatever you want.
[17:36:30] <duch_kazatel> don't modify the files from the plugin.
[17:37:53] <_raul> duch_kazatel: forgot to mention: ty
[17:38:03] <duch_kazatel> _raul don't mention it.
[17:38:07] <_raul> :)
[17:42:23] <ophi-491> are browser extensions allowed to make get requests to sites?
[17:42:57] <duch_kazatel> depends on the site i'm guessing.
[17:43:32] <ophi-491> why?
[17:43:48] <duch_kazatel> CORS ?
[17:44:20] <ophi-491> oh yeah that was my next question - is there anyway to bypass cors being disabled other then a proxy
[17:44:33] <ophi-491> like could it have a session with the domain oppen or somehting
[17:44:48] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:45:21] <ophi-491> oh that sucks
[17:45:57] <ophi-491> what if they had a tab with the main page open
[17:46:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:46:57] <duch_kazatel> nope
[17:47:34] <ophi-491> like i can do get requests in the console if i have the page open in the same window and it works
[17:47:35] <duch_kazatel> it's window-centric, not browser-centric.
[17:47:53] <ophi-491> so the extension couldnt target the window
[17:48:05] <ophi-491> just the active window?
[17:48:13] <duch_kazatel> where are you trying to get/post from?
[17:48:29] <ophi-491> its an exchanges api
[17:49:02] <duch_kazatel> does it allow CORS?
[17:49:13] <duch_kazatel> that's the important part.
[17:49:39] <ophi-491> no but im wondering if you can make an extension target a specific browser tab/window
[17:49:48] <duch_kazatel> probably not.
[17:49:59] <duch_kazatel> but maybe - what are you trying to really do?
[17:50:44] <ophi-491> im getting into web dev but i want to make an extension with live feed market data
[17:51:04] <ophi-491> but you cant really display info can you anyways
[17:51:10] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:51:28] <duch_kazatel> where do you want to dispaly it?
[17:51:50] <ophi-491> i was thinking somewhere in the browser but is that possible?
[17:52:03] <duch_kazatel> why not just make a page instead?
[17:52:11] <duch_kazatel> what exchange is it?
[17:52:29] <ophi-491> https://www.mintpal.com/api/v2
[17:52:40] <duch_kazatel> oh you're this guy.  you need to proxy that through a server.
[17:53:11] <ophi-491> yeah someone showed me the script on how to do it and i got it working
[17:53:18] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[17:53:22] <duch_kazatel> what script?
[17:53:33] <ophi-491> using one of the proxies ill find it
[17:53:39] <duch_kazatel> ah with a proxy ok.
[17:53:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah so you need to talk to that proxy.
[17:53:57] <duch_kazatel> the rest of it is up to you.
[17:54:22] <ophi-491> oh okay, but it would be as secure right?
[17:54:34] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:54:59] <ophi-491> i dont really know how it works yet lol im just wondering if it is the same as making requests directly
[17:55:22] <ophi-491> and what did you mean by a page ?
[17:55:28] <duch_kazatel> errr, no.  you're making requests to your own box instead of directly.  "the same as" is vague
[17:55:37] <duch_kazatel> "a page" as in "something you host on your server"
[17:56:28] <ophi-491> i wanted the data to be more easily accessible
[17:56:39] <ophi-491> but i guess you cant overlay anything with an extension right
[17:56:46] <duch_kazatel> you probably can.
[17:56:52] <duch_kazatel> you mean like a part of the window?
[17:57:08] <ophi-491> yeah, or even the small ppop up part when you click on it
[17:57:12] <ophi-491> if it had to be done that way
[17:57:16] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_external
[17:57:41] <duch_kazatel> for the chrome version
[17:57:50] <ophi-491> oh awesome thanks a lot
[17:58:11] <duch_kazatel> the first rule of making any web-based thing - know exactly what you want the end result to look like.
[17:58:16] <duch_kazatel> or have a really good idea.
[17:58:43] <ophi-491> yeah im still figuring it out im mostly doing it to learn stuff
[17:58:54] <ophi-491> i just have to make sure you can do get requests but i dont see why you wouldnt
[17:59:24] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to embed an iframe, you don't need to worry about that part.
[17:59:42] <ophi-491> why?
[17:59:44] <duch_kazatel> but that page I linked has a section called Referencing external resources
[17:59:55] <duch_kazatel> which is exactly what you want.
[18:00:10] <duch_kazatel> because iframes and XMLHttpRequests are completely different.
[18:01:08] <ophi-491> oh i see now that is perfect
[18:01:32] <ophi-491> i dont know why i was thinking extension dev would be a lot ddifferent than what i have seen
[18:02:07] <duch_kazatel> it'll be a little different, but not terribly.
[18:02:55] <ophi-491> thanks a ton again
[18:02:59] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[18:15:58] <hbeck> so, I have an input field whose "change" event is handled by a javascriptMVC controller - this works fine as long as I type the value into the field with the keyboard and then remove focus. I am trying to get a jquery keypad plugin working on the input field - no luck. The keypad shows up, I can click on it to add input, but the value is not ever applied to the input's value attr AND I don't ever get the change event in the MVC controller.
[18:16:56] <hbeck> Any ideas on this? Need to see it in action or a code sample?
[18:19:10] <ophi-491> -
[18:24:06] <ophi-491> hbeck I am new but if you have to remove focus with the keyboard could it have something to do wiith removing focus from the keypad?
[18:24:28] <ophi-491> you should post a fiddle for others
[18:29:31] <hbeck> ophi-491: I've tried calling blur() or change() manually by hooking a custom function into the keypad's onClose() sequence. No effect
[18:37:09] <ophi-491> hbeck: i dont know if it will help but here is a plugin example http://www.jqueryscript.net/other/jQuery-Plugin-for-Simple-Virtual-Keyboard-keypad.html
[19:37:32] <ophi491> Hey, has anyone made an extension in google chrome?
[19:39:06] <jrajav> Yeah, it's not too hard
[19:39:21] <jrajav> Clone a barebones template, pull up the API docs, go to town
[19:40:01] <ophi491> jrajav I'm wondering if you can create a sandboxxed window embedded into the chrome window?
[19:40:19] <ophi491> instead of having it in a separate window
[19:40:48] <jrajav> You mean, just a normal tab? Yeah sure
[19:41:35] <ophi491> I mean have a window embedded inside a normal tab, overlaying the tabs' content
[19:42:02] <ophi491> im looking at: https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_external - but I dont know if sandboxxing means it has to be in a separate window
[19:43:18] <ophi491> I pretty much want the functionality of the window that opens when you click on the extension icon, just placing it wherever I want
[19:48:16] <ophi491> Oh nice nevermind I found an example
[19:49:49] <jrajav> Good, cause I'm still not sure what you mean :P
[20:04:33] <Mo0O> hi there, I'm looking for a good way to load an internal jquery if can't connect to external provider (such as google) when not connecting to the web
[20:04:45] <Mo0O> any idea?
[20:13:12] <Foxhoundz> I'm trying to create a feedback tab animation
[20:13:21] <Foxhoundz> baically I need to slide in a div when a user clicks a button
[20:13:23] <Foxhoundz> from the side
[20:13:35] <Foxhoundz> The problem is calculating the width of the fixed width
[20:13:44] <Foxhoundz> in order to slide it in regardless of the resolution
[20:13:50] <Foxhoundz> how do I go about doing such athing?
[20:15:28] <ophi491> Foxhoundz what do you mean by regardless of the resolution
[20:16:06] <Foxhoundz> ophi491: If I narrow the browser window, the slide in aniamtion doesn't push the div in all the way
[20:16:09] <Foxhoundz> so only part of it is showing
[20:16:24] <Foxhoundz> I'm using .animate({'left': 'xx%'}); to show the div
[20:17:04] <ophi491> So do you want to resize the div or push it in further depending on the window size?
[20:17:11] <Foxhoundz> the latter
[20:17:21] <Foxhoundz> because a static CSS file will change the width at different breakpoints
[20:17:35] <Foxhoundz> so setting a fixed percentage to push it doesn't work always
[20:17:46] <Foxhoundz> so I have to get a calculated width of the div
[20:17:56] <Foxhoundz> but since it's fixed. using .width() returns 0 or nothing at all
[20:18:54] <ophi491> Wouldnt you want the width of the window to determine the % left
[20:21:44] <ophi491> I think this is the problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16442457/why-does-fixed-positioning-alter-the-width-of-an-element
[20:22:16] <Foxhoundz> ...do..do I?
[20:24:36] <ophi491> and this will help you solve it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12118739/assigning-css-width-to-a-positionfixed-element
[20:26:22] <hbeck> ophi491: that link you gave me above is the exact one I am using.
[20:27:15] <ophi491> hbeck: lol that is weird, i hope its useful then
[20:28:18] <hbeck> ophi491: I can't make sense of some of the junk they are doing in the internals of it in terms of updating the value... but for whatever reason I'm not getting the change event in javascriptMVC
[20:29:55] <ophi491> hbeck: do you have a fiddle example
[20:30:41] <hbeck> ophi491: I was going to make one but not able to really get it useful since I'm not sure how to plug in the whole mvc thing for fiddle haha
[20:31:00] <hbeck> and that is where the disconnect is
[20:31:34] <ophi491> hbeck: you can just post the code snippet of what you think the problem is
[20:32:04] <Foxhoundz> ophi491: http://jsfiddle.net/6Yy7w/1/
[20:32:07] <Foxhoundz> This is what I mean
[20:33:26] <Foxhoundz> I'm sure there's a better way to do this
[20:33:42] <ophi491> Foxhoundz: what is it that you want it to do?
[20:34:51] <Foxhoundz> Just what it looks like. You click a button, and a fixed div slides in
[20:35:19] <Foxhoundz> The problem I'm encountering is to figure out how far to push it in based on the current window width
[20:35:52] <ophi491> How much of it do you want to  be shown? the maximum and minimum?
[20:36:09] <Foxhoundz> well, the div is 400px
[20:36:15] <Foxhoundz> so 100% of that fixed width
[20:36:24] <Foxhoundz> regardless of the resolution, at least on non-mobile resolutions
[20:36:43] <Foxhoundz> right now it's using a set percentage so if you resize the window to make it bigger it's pushing it too far in
[20:37:27] <Foxhoundz> ophi491: http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Simple-jQuery-Plugin-For-Slide-Out-Tab-Feedback-Widget-Feedback-Me/http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Simple-jQuery-Plugin-For-Slide-Out-Tab-Feedback-Widget-Feedback-Me/
[20:37:31] <Foxhoundz> better example
[20:43:32] <ophi491> hm ok
[20:49:36] <ophi491> oh ok
[20:49:42] <ophi491> lol i think i get it now
[20:50:50] <Foxhoundz> ...
[20:50:59] <Foxhoundz> Really
[20:51:00] <Foxhoundz> REALLY
[20:51:15] <Foxhoundz> Hell, you're not going to help me. You're in the same boat as I am at this rate
[20:51:17] <Foxhoundz> :-)
[20:55:24] <ophi491> You need to get the width of the document and subtract it by the width of the div
[20:55:45] <ophi491> and that will be how much you move it
[20:55:50] <ophi491> sry i am trying to figure this other thing out
[21:02:29] <ophi491> Foxhoundz: http://jsfiddle.net/qL6tP/
[21:02:37] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[21:03:06] <silv3r_m00n> i want to find all elements with a given class, after (domwise) a certain element A, the other elements may be outside the parent of A
[21:03:12] <silv3r_m00n> which function should i use ?
[21:06:03] <shoky> what is "after (domwise)"
[21:06:17] <silv3r_m00n> shoky: which come later on after that element
[21:06:30] <shoky> the DOM is a tree
[21:06:43] <silv3r_m00n> hmm
[21:06:43] <shoky> children of same parent have an order between them
[21:06:52] <shoky> children of different parents dont have any order between them
[21:07:01] <silv3r_m00n> then order of parents would matter
[21:07:13] <silv3r_m00n> i used the nextAll function, but it does not find children outside the parent
[21:07:31] <shoky> best is to limit yourself to a more specific selection than what you asked for,
[21:07:57] <silv3r_m00n> i just all element of a certain class, that come after a given element, in the html structure
[21:07:59] <shoky> and use .closest('.someclass').find('.someotherclass')  or something like that, depending on your structure
[21:08:12] <silv3r_m00n> want/
[21:08:33] <shoky> there is no html structure after the html has been parsed. it's just a DOM tree.
[21:09:01] <shoky> "after" is meaningless in a DOM tree unless you're talking about siblings
[21:31:07] <Foxhoundz> ophi491: I love you.
[21:33:06] <ophi491> Foxhoundz: you will have to do a check to see if window.innerwidth < 400 and handle it however
[21:35:45] <IHaveAQuery> if I have something like this: $('#mySubmission').submit(function (event) {
[21:36:00] <IHaveAQuery> How can I determine the ID of the button that was clicked to trigger that submission?
[21:38:24] <Foxhoundz> $(this).find('button[type="submit"]').attr('id');
[21:39:13] <ophi491> IHaveAQuery: event.target.id should work as well
[21:39:25] <shoky> that'd give him the form's id
[21:40:29] <IHaveAQuery> that just gives me the form id, yeah
[21:40:46] <shoky> IHaveAQuery: if you have multiple buttons there's no really nice way to do it. either a click handler, or maybe $(':button:focus') might work - donno if crossbrowser.
[21:40:58] <shoky> also who said it was a button that triggered the submit
[21:41:01] <IHaveAQuery> is it better to have a click handler on each button?
[21:41:08] <IHaveAQuery> I did :)
[21:41:21] <ophi491> oh ok
[21:42:38] <shoky> if you need to handle clicks specifically, click handlers are the way to go
[21:43:22] <Foxhoundz> If there's only one button type of submit
[21:43:29] <Foxhoundz> the above code should work
[21:43:37] <shoky> but then he wouldnt' be asking the question..
[21:43:50] <shoky> i hope
[21:44:33] <Foxhoundz> What if you submit the form by pressing enter and for one reason or another you still want the id of the submit button
[21:44:36] <Foxhoundz> you know what, nevermind
[21:44:43] <Foxhoundz> I don't know what is trying to do
[21:48:23] <IHaveAQuery> yeah, I have multiple buttons
[21:48:53] <IHaveAQuery> I have a text box -> button (submit new item)
[21:49:01] <IHaveAQuery> plus a list of items with checkboxes
[21:49:17] <IHaveAQuery> and at the bottom a "delete selected" button and an "edit selected" button
[21:49:31] <Foxhoundz> is this some sort of an ajax form?
[21:49:36] <IHaveAQuery> so I want to have the form go to different actions depending on what button is clicked
[21:49:37] <IHaveAQuery> no
[21:49:51] <Foxhoundz> oh
[21:50:09] <ophi491> can you pass the id of the button as a paramater
[21:50:13] <Foxhoundz> well, adding a click handler on the main submit button and reading the value of the checkboxes is probably the most straightforward way to go about it
[21:52:12] <IHaveAQuery> how do I submit the form in jquery?
[21:52:15] <IHaveAQuery> if I use a click handler?
[21:52:29] <Foxhoundz> $('#myform').submit();
[21:52:30] <IHaveAQuery> or would the click handler happen before the form is submitted?
[21:52:57] <IHaveAQuery> would it be submitting twice?
[21:53:13] <IHaveAQuery> or should I just change the button from type submit to type button?
[21:55:55] <Foxhoundz> IHaveAQuery: the latter would work
[21:57:10] <ophi491> cant you just have the .submit inside the .click
[22:12:28] <ophi491> IHaveAQuery did you figure it out?
[22:23:25] <gratis> So I have a template that displays a queryset. Each element of this queryset has a "color" attribute. What I would love to do, is present the user with a radio-group of buttons containing options for each of these colors. When one is clicked, the queryset is winnowed and only that color remains. Bonus points if it's Ajaxified.
[22:24:11] <gratis> In broad, hand-waving terms, how best to go about this?
[22:24:12] <jcutrell> gratis: Take a look at Angular. I think it’s probably got what you need. But,
[22:24:22] <jcutrell> gratis: another option is to just serialize a form.
[22:24:32] <jcutrell> gratis: one moment
[22:27:32] <gratis> Hmmm. So this angular can be used on top of django to achieve what I'm looking for?
[22:30:03] <jcutrell> gratis: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gtJsi
[22:30:07] <jcutrell> There’s that
[22:35:40] <LoneStar99> howdy folks, need to parse "pprice" from the following json -> http://pastebin.com/HbYZiNpd
[22:36:11] <jcutrell> That json appears to have a syntax error.
[22:36:21] <jcutrell> Ah wait
[22:36:24] <jcutrell> maybe not. :)
[22:37:09] <LoneStar99> jcutrell: yeah no syntax error, took me hours to get it working, now need to parse it using jquery
[22:37:27] <jcutrell> That would be something like response.forEach(function(el){ if (el.pprice){ // do something with pprice } })
[22:37:47] <jcutrell> Response is an array of objects, with the first one being some meta.
[22:37:56] <jcutrell> (And the last one too, apparently.)
[22:38:03] <jcutrell> And a few others?
[22:38:05] <jcutrell> weird,
[22:38:15] <jcutrell> but just check for existence in each of those pieces of the array.
[22:39:28] <LoneStar99> using the following code ->  http://jsfiddle.net/EVwM7/
[22:40:09] <jcutrell> What’s breaking?
[22:42:32] <LoneStar99> jcutrell: can't seem to get pprice
[22:42:53] <jcutrell> Some of those objects don’t have pprice defined.
[22:44:05] <LoneStar99> jcutrell: oh ok that might be it, let me fix sql code
[22:48:22] <LoneStar99> thanks
[22:54:22] <wormmd> Howdy all, attempting to prepopulate some input fields with data, see lines 24 and 38: http://jsfiddle.net/wormmd/Lb5t3/1/

[23:17:12] <wormmd> shoky: I *really* wasn't paying attention to the jQuery API, like at all.
[23:17:27] <wormmd> shoky: making really bad, half-informed decisions.
