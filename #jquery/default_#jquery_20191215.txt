[10:44:54] <CrazySam> http://jsfiddle.net/uodmqy8L/
[10:45:24] <CrazySam> is $('.clear') targeting button id="0" class="button clear" ?
[10:45:38] <CrazySam> and why is it working at all?
[10:46:05] <CrazySam> the name of the class is "button clear" not "clear"
[10:47:14] <bestdesign> what is problem?
[10:48:00] <CrazySam> problem: it's working
[10:48:08] <CrazySam> it should not be working?
[10:48:23] <CrazySam> there is no class named "clear" is there?
[10:48:33] <pavonia> class="button clear" means classes "button" and "clear"
[10:49:07] <bestdesign> yes both
[10:49:09] <CrazySam> aah
[10:49:12] <CrazySam> ok
[10:49:15] <pavonia> The only problem I see is that you have two click handlers for the clear button
[10:50:22] <bestdesign> CrazySam: also is a good idea the events from JS call with ID not with CSS class
[10:51:35] <CrazySam> this isn't mine it's something i found on the web
[10:51:48] <CrazySam> i want to try understand it
[10:51:58] <CrazySam> and maybe fix the result button
[10:52:05] <CrazySam> that's the only thing that's broken
[10:52:52] <bestdesign> for get the result i think need a lot of more things
[10:53:58] <CrazySam> yeah it needs work
[10:54:07] <CrazySam> also the html id names are not unique
[10:54:56] <CrazySam> val($('#result').val() + $(this).val())
[10:55:10] <CrazySam> is $(this).val() equivalent to $('#result')?
[10:55:56] <bestdesign> i think yes
[10:59:28] <CrazySam> so line 2, 3, 4 are responsible for listening for a button click and concatenating their values in the read-only input box?
[11:01:19] <bestdesign> CrazySam: is for add every number after click on it
[11:01:25] <bestdesign> for calculate
[11:02:07] <CrazySam> it's not for calculating, it's only for displaying them
[11:02:23] <CrazySam> on a single line
[11:02:50] <CrazySam> for example "3 5 6 + 4 - 1"
[11:02:52] <bestdesign> CrazySam: what you want to do with this calculator?
[11:03:48] <CrazySam> i am studying the code to understand it so i can fix it so it actually works
[11:04:06] <CrazySam> i am only telling you how i understand the code
[11:04:18] <CrazySam> i have no experience in jquery
[11:04:56] <CrazySam> line 6, 7, 8 are responsible for listening for click on the clear (c) button only, and setting the value of input element to blank
[11:05:30] <CrazySam> now we come to the important stuff... the equal button for results... which is broken
[11:05:50] <CrazySam> line 10, 11, 12, 13
[11:06:18] <CrazySam> how do we fix this? what is wrong with it?
[11:07:19] <CrazySam> <button type="submit" class="button sum">=</button>
[11:08:15] <CrazySam> $('.sum').click(); this means listen for click on button with sum class
[11:08:39] <CrazySam> then we have anonymous function right?
[11:09:11] <bestdesign> first of all some ID names is already have set
[11:09:16] <bestdesign> like 5
[11:09:26] <CrazySam> correct
[11:09:32] <CrazySam> i noticed
[11:09:55] <CrazySam> i am trying to do minimal work :)
[11:10:12] <CrazySam> i want to see if we can fix the jquery code
[11:10:20] <CrazySam> without changing too much
[11:10:42] <bestdesign> so you want to show some result on click =?
[11:11:06] <CrazySam> correct
[11:11:25] <CrazySam> for example they have var cal = $('#result').val();
[11:12:12] <CrazySam> but what does this do? gets a value val() from where? and stores it in variable named cal? this doesn't make sense
[11:12:30] <CrazySam> then they say $('#result').val(cal);
[11:12:43] <CrazySam> this is correct i think but there is no value in cal
[11:12:48] <bestdesign> well is not will do the math thing
[11:13:21] <CrazySam> yes, it is not doing the math at all
[11:13:54] <bestdesign> also there need an error detector to not able to write multiple + and -
[11:14:23] <CrazySam> ah yes that is correct
[11:14:28] <CrazySam> it needs a lot of work then :)
[11:15:29] <bestdesign> CrazySam: and you will sell this calculator to clients :D?
[11:15:59] <CrazySam> hehe big money will rain! :)
[11:17:11] <bestdesign> CrazySam: what a plan :P
[11:17:45] <bestdesign> CrazySam: https://jsfiddle.net/e94ha3xw/
[11:18:58] <CrazySam> nice!
[11:19:37] <CrazySam> but you can't clear?
[11:19:47] <bestdesign> CrazySam: there is no clear you are right
[11:20:09] <bestdesign> but if you want go big make from your calculator this one :D see code
[11:23:52] <bestdesign> CrazySam: http://jsfiddle.net/sjzpw41n/ this how can handle the calculate
[11:24:02] <bestdesign> + / etc
[11:24:34] <CrazySam> thanks! i will use this for inspiration :)
[11:30:55] <CrazySam> http://jsfiddle.net/uodmqy8L/
[11:31:20] <CrazySam> version 2: http://jsfiddle.net/es28bmLt/1/
[11:32:20] <CrazySam> i moved the storage of result or input up where it is collected
[11:32:53] <CrazySam> var storedInput = $('#result').val($('#result').val() + $(this).val());
[11:33:01] <bestdesign> yes
[11:33:04] <CrazySam> $('#result').val(storedInput);
[11:33:21] <CrazySam> but storedInput is just a string
[11:33:32] <CrazySam> it now needs to be parsed
[11:33:49] <CrazySam> and split
[11:34:10] <bestdesign> and do the math
[11:34:19] <bestdesign> CrazySam: you why want to be just calculator maker?
[11:34:20] <CrazySam> and math operations done on it and then returned when = is clicked
[11:34:57] <CrazySam> hehe this is a challenge for me :)
[11:35:24] <CrazySam> i know almost nothing about jquery
[11:35:51] <bestdesign> CrazySam: is fucking simple
[11:36:11] <CrazySam> this is not my code, it's someone else who wrote it and i want to try improve it
[11:36:18] <bestdesign> jquery is a library where you call pre writed functions to do nothing more easy
[11:36:37] <bestdesign> write less do more :D
[11:37:06] <CrazySam> yes it's the same with other languages
[11:37:46] <bestdesign> parsefloat function is basic js
[11:37:52] <bestdesign> is work with jquery
[11:39:14] <CrazySam> is jquery still popular?
[11:40:08] <bestdesign> well you can do without jquery
[11:40:20] <bestdesign> is about same but you need write a lot of things for that
[11:40:47] <bestdesign> is like bootstrap for make websites with it more easy without it not that easy
[11:41:32] <bestdesign> CrazySam: the jquery popular on front end
[11:41:44] <bestdesign> for backend you can use a lot of more things
[11:42:11] <CrazySam> so jquery is like javascript you only write less?
[11:43:00] <bestdesign> CrazySam: yes jquery is a plus with a noconflict way so you can use jquery and also js
[11:43:03] <bestdesign> both works
[11:43:09] <bestdesign> without js you cant use jquery so
[11:43:28] <bestdesign> is based on js
[11:44:34] <CrazySam> jquery is like higher level javascript?
[11:45:21] <bestdesign> CrazySam: mostly things can do without jquery but not that fast as you need write whole
[11:45:52] <bestdesign> CrazySam: is for help you write less code and do more things as slogan
[11:48:35] <CrazySam> is jquery good starting point for someone who does not know javascript?
[11:49:26] <CrazySam> "write less, do more" i see the slogan now :)
[11:50:15] <bestdesign> CrazySam: you need to know basic things with var data types etc
[11:50:20] <bestdesign> but sure is easy
[11:52:11] <bestdesign> CrazySam: https://tutorialcodeplay.com/jquery/jquery-hide.html
[11:52:19] <bestdesign> there is bulint in fuction list about
[11:55:25] <CrazySam> thank you!
[11:56:05] <bestdesign> also you can try there to understand
[13:33:56] <CrazySam> http://jsfiddle.net/sbo61k0g/8/
[13:34:14] <CrazySam> why is result button not working?
[13:43:49] <pavonia> .val(...) doesn't return a string
[13:45:18] <pavonia> Also, why do you maintain inputString if the text is already stored in the input field?
[13:45:45] <CrazySam> what does it return then?
[13:46:15] <pavonia> A jQuery object
[13:47:32] <CrazySam> so what do we need to do to make it a string?
[13:47:37] <CrazySam> .toString()?
[13:48:47] <CrazySam> see if you can make it work
[13:49:48] <CrazySam> why i use inputString? so i can pass it into eval()
[13:50:10] <CrazySam> i don't know how else i would do that
[13:55:26] <pavonia> You need to understand the difference between $foo.val() and $foo.val(blah)
[13:55:34] <pavonia> https://api.jquery.com/val/
[13:56:07] <pavonia> One reads the value, the other sets it
[14:03:28] <bestdesign> yes
[14:03:49] <bestdesign> the theid.val(); get the value
[14:04:02] <bestdesign> the theid.val('what i set');
[14:04:19] <bestdesign> is set the value
[14:04:53] <CrazySam> yes, and what do i need to do? set or get?
[14:05:24] <bestdesign> you need get the value there
[14:05:29] <bestdesign> what numbers writed
[14:05:35] <bestdesign> so you not want to set
[14:06:11] <CrazySam> $('#result').val(eval(inputString));
[14:06:15] <CrazySam> so instead of this i need
[14:06:22] <CrazySam> $('#result').val();
[14:06:47] <bestdesign> 	var inputString;
[14:06:55] <bestdesign> you set nothing for inputString
[14:07:12] <bestdesign> so if you set like
[14:07:22] <bestdesign> inputString = "1234";
[14:07:24] <bestdesign> and set
[14:07:34] <bestdesign> $('#result').val(inputString);
[14:07:41] <bestdesign> the result val will be 1234
[14:08:32] <CrazySam> that's not a calculation
[14:08:39] <bestdesign> var inputString = "1234";
[14:08:49] <bestdesign> you are right
[14:09:00] <bestdesign> is just set the var value in val
[14:09:48] <CrazySam> http://jsfiddle.net/jwne8qd0/1/
[14:10:15] <CrazySam> i click on = and i get static 9
[14:10:22] <CrazySam> the answer to everything is 9 :)
[14:11:13] <bestdesign> yes because
[14:11:16] <bestdesign> 	var inputString = "2+3+4";
[14:12:10] <CrazySam> correct
[14:12:20] <CrazySam> but why does inputString need to be initialized?
[14:12:37] <bestdesign> is no need
[14:13:57] <bestdesign> CrazySam: or you can get the value from typed val and calculate that
[14:14:00] <bestdesign> not your numbers
[14:15:52] <CrazySam> http://jsfiddle.net/jwne8qd0/2/
[14:16:11] <CrazySam> i tried to simplify it be declaring a new variable cal
[14:16:40] <CrazySam> now i get blanks instead of "[object Object]"
[14:16:49] <CrazySam> some progress :p
[14:17:31] <bestdesign> lol
[14:17:38] <bestdesign> what is cal?
[14:17:42] <bestdesign> you need to set with var
[14:18:03] <CrazySam> i can't use val() to set a value, i must use val(whatever) to set a value
[14:18:24] <CrazySam> that's why i nested val(eval(inputString)) originally
[14:18:48] <bestdesign> hmm
[14:18:58] <CrazySam> default string representation of object in javascript is [object Object]
[14:19:43] <CrazySam> so i need to do something with that object before i place it in #result
[14:19:57] <CrazySam> i don't know what to do with it sir :) that's my problem
[14:20:05] <bestdesign> CrazySam: you will be big calculator seller
