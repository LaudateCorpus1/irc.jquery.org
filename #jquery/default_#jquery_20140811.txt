[00:16:54] <frank_o> Anyone know what's up with the delay between hover and SVG animation start? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xgjpL3bg/
[00:16:57] <frank_o> The SVG also flickers for like a millisecond before it disappears and reappears to complete the animation.
[00:17:25] <frank_o> Might be jQuery's fault idk
[00:17:47] <Cork> frank_o: why force the browser to reparse the svg tree?
[00:40:08] <thomedy> what kind of things do i need to consider with security in forms
[00:40:19] <thomedy> i am intending to regex out any database attacks
[00:44:27] <flam_> csrf checks at least
[00:44:43] <flam_> but i don't think those are really jquery specific issues:p
[00:46:53] <Anticom> thomedy: Security should be done on your backend. When using MySQL using prepared statements would be a good start.
[00:47:04] <thomedy> well here is the issue
[00:47:18] <thomedy> i did most of this in drupal because time is an issue
[00:47:30] <thomedy> so php is dealt with and the security is pretty strong
[00:47:40] <thomedy> but im ajaxing the form submit
[00:47:53] <thomedy> pdo is what they use
[00:48:01] <thomedy>  i know cuz iwrite modules al l the time
[00:48:16] <Anticom> I'm not into dupral but there should be authentication/authorisation aswell. Please refer to #dupral (?! i guess)
[00:48:18] <thomedy> i think however by ajaxing the submit i bypass the validating
[00:49:03] <hooligan123> wow that is a weird one
[00:49:07] <thomedy> i can ask them but if i bypass the submit event with jquery and lose the drupal validation....
[00:49:12] <thomedy> then i am validating myself
[00:49:15] <thomedy> which is fine
[00:49:18] <Anticom> thomedy: IMHO jQuery also submits (since it's based on regular XHR) cookies, so your session cookie should be available on the server-side aswell
[00:49:37] <thomedy> wha tis imho
[00:49:45] <Anticom> in my humbe oppinion
[00:49:57] <Anticom> thomedy: afaik there should be no difference between "regular" requests and async requests
[00:50:13] <thomedy> cool
[00:50:15] <Anticom> so everything should work the same on the server side, except JSON is the prefered data exchange format
[00:50:25] <thomedy> right but im not using the submit event in jquery
[00:50:34] <thomedy> because it works on type=submit
[00:50:36] <Anticom> thomedy: i suppose you're using $.ajax
[00:50:41] <thomedy> yes
[00:50:45] <thomedy> well .post
[00:50:48] <thomedy> but basically yes
[00:50:55] <thomedy> same idea really
[00:50:55] <Anticom> open your browser debugger and look at the request that's fired
[00:50:59] <Cork> frank_o: you could try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/xgjpL3bg/8/
[00:51:35] <hooligan123> ;( what is this now.... var console($('#bubble_newnotices')[0].innerHTML); produces the desired result and undefined at the same time ?? in console .. when I am doing it in my function mysteriously the variable I assign innerHTML to is "undefined" even though its assined at the very top
[00:51:40] <thomedy> okay... you lost me a little bit... but im not going to not do it... let me just give some context to make sure i should stil do it
[00:52:34] <thomedy> if i put a click even on the button that says save
[00:52:36] <Anticom> hooligan123: what are you trying to achive?
[00:52:41] <thomedy> and i phrase it that way on purpose
[00:52:50] <thomedy> and then prevent default and
[00:52:51] <Anticom> thomedy: why don't you post your js code so we can take a look at it?
[00:52:52] <Anticom> :)
[00:52:57] <thomedy> i can do that its reall easy
[00:52:58] <thomedy> one sec
[00:53:01] <Anticom> would me much easier than explaining it line by line
[00:53:03] <thomedy> ill js fiddle it
[00:53:05] <thomedy> your totally right
[00:53:29] <Anticom> brb
[00:57:14] <hooligan123> what I want to do is check if the value of .html() is the same as the value I am already trying to give to .html() and skip on by... but as I say mysteriously any variable I try to have the .html() or with dom .innerHTML put into seems to be 'undefined' later, later.. being inside getJSON  its the weirdest most annoying  thing I have ever seen in my life I put this one on the back burner for
[00:57:14] <hooligan123> ages thinking I would come back to it and over come it .. but this has just fked the pooch i think maybe I am just tierd
[00:58:09] <Cork> hooligan123: sounds like your in a race or scope problem
[00:58:13] <Cork> it isn't about .html()
[00:58:39] <Cork> that said, getting the data from .html() will cause the browser to serialize the entire dom structure
[00:58:59] <Cork> you are better of if you can find a more specific data you can store about the section
[00:59:12] <Cork> that doesn't involve serializing the entire blob
[00:59:48] <Anticom> hooligan123: you might check your selector then
[01:00:10] <Anticom> oh hey Cork \o/
[01:00:13] <Cork> o/
[01:02:51] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/w95mbz5h/1/
[01:02:56] <hooligan123> yep its deo some type of scope issue cork i test that and the variable before christ is not udefined by after death it surely is
[01:02:57] <thomedy> simplified version of what im dealing with
[01:03:04] <thomedy> i made 3 type=submits
[01:03:11] <thomedy> beccause thats how drupal creates the form
[01:03:34] <Cork> thomedy: what are you trying to do?
[01:03:53] <thomedy> im prepariing to validate
[01:04:09] <Cork> don't bind click on submit
[01:04:14] <Cork> bind submit on the form
[01:04:20] <thomedy> well ic ant use the submit event that i know of
[01:04:27] <thomedy> because it has more than one submit type button int he form
[01:04:52] <Cork> then have events on the buttons store what button you clicked
[01:04:52] <thomedy> so if i click enter which is the previous way of doing things
[01:04:52] <thomedy> it acts on anyone of those things
[01:04:58] <Cork> and do it all in the submit event
[01:05:22] <Cork> doing javascript handling for a form without a submit event will result in broken behaviors
[01:05:43] <thomedy> i was loooking through the event in jquery fire bug and saw nothign that stood out as unique
[01:05:47] <Cork> as there is ways to submit a form without clicking
[01:05:51] <thomedy> so what are you suggesting with saving
[01:05:57] <thomedy> right enter and i read that and i didn't want to lose that
[01:06:15] <Cork> thomedy: you could do something like $(this).closest('form').data('button', this);
[01:06:18] <thomedy> but i didn't see anything unique yet that could help me decide what submit button i used
[01:06:26] <thomedy> oooh i dont know data
[01:06:28] <thomedy> let me google that
[01:06:33] <Cork> and in the submit event do if($(this).data('button')) { $(this).data('button') }
[01:06:47] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com data
[01:06:48] <b-ot> Cork: .data() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/data/
[01:16:50] <frank_o> Cork: hey!
[01:17:09] <lite_> ThomasCle: er det kodedag idag? Jeg har 3 ting jeg skal være 100% sikker på er funktionelle og klar til kravspec testing imorgen
[01:17:18] <frank_o> Cork: well that sure did it! thank you very much!
[01:17:21] <lite_> wrong channel :/
[01:17:21] <Cork> lite_: english please
[01:17:30] <lite_> My mistake Cork
[01:17:32] <Cork> frank_o: np :)
[01:17:32] <frank_o> sorry the late reply
[01:17:51] <Cork> frank_o: the problem you had was two folded
[01:18:04] <Cork> 1. events doesn't bubble normally from svg > html
[01:18:19] <Cork> so hover went nuts (and mouseenter doesn't work)
[01:18:31] <Cork> and secondly the animation started at 0 instead of 125
[01:20:25] <Cork> so the delay you saw was from the animation from 0 to 125
[01:20:54] <frank_o> Cork: oh yeah!
[01:21:16] <frank_o> that makes a lot of sense. will look up the bubbly part in detail
[01:21:24] <hooligan123> for some reason I can get the value via .text() instead of .html() its a <span> I am dealing with
[01:21:49] <Cork> hooligan123: try reproducing the problem in a fiddle
[01:22:47] <frank_o> Cork: gonna use this countdown thing for this banner that expands to present some products. if the countdown thing is laggy it might affect my users decisions to buy these products so
[01:23:48] <frank_o> if i do get rich ill remember you and give you a large cut
[01:29:26] <thomedy> okay my wife woke up.. up back...  i just read the .data on jquery it seems that your suggestion finds the closest form which in js fiddle is the container form and then stores data from the button i clicked
[01:29:29] <thomedy> "button" this
[01:29:35] <thomedy> how close am i
[01:30:01] <Cork> thomedy: that is the way it works yes
[01:37:16] <thomedy> ill be honest cork... i still dont see any unique traits about what your suggesting
[01:37:25] <thomedy> if i click any submit button they all give me the same thing
[01:37:28] <thomedy> let me give you the jsfiddle
[01:37:52] <Cork> thomedy: like i said you can submit a form in more ways they clicking buttons with a mouse
[01:37:54] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/w95mbz5h/2/
[01:38:17] <Cork> so depending on the user clicking buttons will result in broken behaviors
[01:38:30] <thomedy> okay... thats fine and thank you for that input
[01:38:32] <Cork> like auto fill not working, screen readers failing
[01:38:40] <Cork> keyboard navigation breaking
[01:38:41] <Cork> and so on
[01:39:04] <thomedy> that is soemething i didn't know so i actualy do appreciate it... but what im looking for right now is how to define when submit is not preview or in the fiddle
[01:39:23] <thomedy> in the fiddle i have 3 submits
[01:39:25] <thomedy> grab_file
[01:39:28] <thomedy> preview and save
[01:39:40] <thomedy> i want to always know when save is the button that triggered the event
[01:39:42] <Cork> thomedy: if($($(this).data('button').hasClass('preview')) {}
[01:39:43] <thomedy> thats my goal right now
[01:39:48] <Cork> opps
[01:39:52] <Cork> thomedy: if($($(this).data('button')).hasClass('preview')) {}
[01:40:09] <thomedy> okay.. let me see waht i missed because that s my fault
[01:40:19] <thomedy> i was looking for waht you typed and didn't read all of data()
[01:40:21] <thomedy> my bad
[01:56:31] <hooligan123> I got it working cork
[01:56:45] <hooligan123> I cant understand for the life of me what just happened there but that was happy hour for real
[01:57:40] <hooligan123> I am using .html() now as well
[01:57:54] <hooligan123> so what ever cob web got into things there I duno.. $.trim was involved too
[01:59:14] <Cork> hooligan123: i can't help you in any way without seeing the code in action
[01:59:42] <hooligan123> jsfiddle wont let you getJSON from another domain though
[01:59:55] <Cork> you can fake the getjson call with a timer
[02:00:12] <Cork> or use jsfiddles json echo service
[02:00:29] <Cork> btw it isn't jsfiddle blocking the call it is the browser + the source of the json
[02:00:57] <hooligan123> ah
[02:01:17] <hooligan123> i forgot they had that echo thingy
[02:02:59] <thomedy> i kinda thought after reading the data() page that i would see something in my object of athe click event on fire bug
[02:03:08] <thomedy> named after my data var
[02:03:12] <Cork> no
[02:03:17] <thomedy> like data('nameHere')
[02:03:21] <Cork> data assosiates data with the dom element
[02:03:24] <Cork> not events
[02:03:49] <thomedy> yeah but im not even seeing dom elements it keeeps coming up with the form
[02:03:53] <thomedy> total form
[02:04:15] <thomedy> all the elements
[02:04:15] <thomedy> and i need to associate the form with submit because thats the only way submit works
[02:06:43] <thomedy> okay... i got it working with a nother solution it seems
[02:06:51] <thomedy> not using data but find with :focus
[02:07:41] <Cork> thomedy: http://jsfiddle.net/vbr5dbge/
[02:07:58] <Cork> thomedy: focus isn't safe cross systems
[02:08:09] <Cork> especially focus works weirdly on mac
[02:08:37] <thomedy> dang it
[02:08:40] <thomedy> okay
[02:08:44] <thomedy> stupid browsers
[02:08:50] <thomedy> stupid os's
[02:08:53] <Cork> it isn't the browsers fault
[02:08:53] <Cork> ya
[02:09:25] <Cork> well actually it is partly cause the spec doesn't state how things should work
[02:09:39] <Cork> it only points to "like it works natively on the system"
[02:09:44] <Cork> some browsers ignore this though
[02:09:51] <Cork> (like chrome)
[02:14:16] <hooligan123> console.log abuse really gives chrome some butt ake
[02:16:50] <hooligan123> i swear to god vendors better be looking to go full coverage with html5 web audio api on mobile browsers as well Soon!.. i swear there just going to go and stuff every one over and try and come with some shitty excuses why they dont and wont and then blame the specs any way
[02:19:23] <dblosevn> hey, anybody ever play with jquery on node.js? I am experimenting with it right now and having issues, I dont need any dom functionality I just want to use the utility functions eg deferreds xhr each etc nothing that requires selectors or dom manipulation. Do I still need to use jsdom even though I dont need it?
[02:23:51] <thomedy> alright i think i have a finally wokring condition
[02:24:08] <thomedy> my question is any sort of crossbrowser quirks or os quirks i might run into
[02:24:16] <thomedy> i havce a var called submit
[02:24:23] <thomedy> and i have a click event on every submit
[02:24:44] <thomedy> then in my submit event on the form i have the if statement comparing the var submit's id to make sure i have the right now
[02:24:45] <thomedy> one
[02:24:58] <thomedy> i  think it will work
[02:37:10] <Guest16908> Hello, anyone able to give some help? I am new to JQuery Mobile (and designing for mobiles in general!) I just have a few questions to set me in the right direction (hopefully)
[02:39:33] <RichiL> Hello, anyone able to give some help? I am new to JQuery Mobile (and designing for mobiles in general!) I just have a few questions to set me in the right direction
[02:39:57] <lilsammy_> anyone used wdcalendar at all? its a long shot but thought I would ask
[02:46:20] <RichiL> Does anyone know how I can give my mobile form some padding? the textboxes touch the sides and i would like to change that..
[02:48:03] <lilsammy_> wouldn't you set the container to the width of the phone screen using media quieries?
[02:48:08] <lilsammy_> then set the padding :/
[02:50:55] <surgat> box-sizing: border-box; // Allows you to specify padding inside a container without the container growing in size, is that what your after?
[02:51:08] <RichiL> Ah yes thanks surgat
[02:52:17] <RichiL> hopefully will work with jquery mobile - it seems to set everything automatically..
[02:52:43] <surgat> I haven't had much play with jquery mobile, keep telling myself to start a project.
[02:55:33] <Macaveli> I have a link with an URL in a popup is it possible to close the popup (fancybox) before navigating to the link? Now he's navigating in the popup.
[02:57:20] <surgat> Macaveli - So you would want the user to click the link on the popup, that click closes the popup first, then redirects the user to the link?
[02:57:32] <Macaveli> surgat yes indeed
[02:58:33] <surgat> I wouold write a simple function that triggers when thge user clicks the link.
[02:58:58] <Macaveli> surgat window.location.href = '...';
[02:59:14] <surgat> that closes the popup and redirects, but the redirect is under a settimeout - that would wait 1-2 secs before firing the window.location.href = "http://stackoverflow.com";
[02:59:22] <surgat> or whereever you link goes
[02:59:24] <surgat> does that make sense?
[02:59:46] <Macaveli> yes
[02:59:56] <Macaveli> how do i get the click event o na link? I have an id
[03:01:09] <flam_> $('a#<id>').on('click',function(e) {... });
[03:01:16] <Cork> no
[03:01:18] <Cork> no a
[03:01:24] <Cork> just '#<id>'
[03:01:49] <Cork> so $('#my_id_goes_here')
[03:01:56] <Macaveli> alright
[03:02:16] <surgat> couldn't you get ther src like - .attr("src");
[03:07:19] <dblosevn> $('#your_id').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); console.log($(this).attr('href'));});
[03:09:16] <no_gravity> Hello! Neither Javascript nor Jquery have an easy way to access query string paramters these days? It seems such a basic operation.
[03:09:29] <surgat> attr('href') is definately what i meant above, thanks dblosevn.
[03:09:32] <dblosevn> keep in mind id conflicts are easy to come by in jquery mobile as all "pages" in your website are loaded into the dom as they are loaded so if you have the same id on multiple pages in your site you can easily have an id conflict
[03:10:17] <Cork> no_gravity: what's wrong with location.search?
[03:10:59] <dblosevn> one thing I have done to prevent that is using $('#my_id', $.mobile.activePage).on.... which insures the selector starts searching on the active page
[03:11:00] <Cork> no_gravity: if you mean parse the string, sure you need a third party lib for that (or split, or what ever you fancy)
[03:11:59] <dblosevn> Cork :-)
[03:12:09] <no_gravity> Cork: yes, parsing it. i would have expected it in a general purpose lib like jquery.
[03:12:09] <Cork> dblosevn: fix the page so you don't have multiple ids instead
[03:12:14] <dblosevn> You see my question above about node and jquery
[03:12:16] <Cork> as it is invalid id fields
[03:12:25] <dblosevn> ya thats the better fix
[03:12:52] <dblosevn> I have gotten away from using ids in jqm almost entirely for anything other then the page itself
[03:13:07] <Cork> dblosevn: jquery depends on the dom when it loads
[03:13:22] <Cork> you might be better of using a promise lib instead
[03:13:37] <dblosevn> ya deferreds are really all I need
[03:13:46] <Cork> no_gravity: it isn't very common to need to parse the query string in js
[03:13:52] <dblosevn> I was thinking about using npm jquery-deferred
[03:14:01] <Cork> or at least not common enough to have it bundled with the lib
[03:14:21] <Cork> dblosevn: https://www.promisejs.org/
[03:15:42] <dblosevn> Cork: reading thanks

[03:39:11] <Hausas> Anyone could recommend any element masker (like overlay thing [like jquery blockUI]) that actually works?
[03:40:26] <kpap> pasky_: that's really helpful - thank you!
[03:47:43] <Hausas> it's not actually a masker
[03:47:50] <Hausas> it should be a blocker
[04:00:53] <snufft> hi guys!
[04:00:54] <doebi> jointjs seems to override some jqueryui functionality, how can i prevent that? (run code in a nutshell)?
[04:01:35] <Cork> doebi: you might be able to do it with freeze
[04:01:55] <Cork> depending on what engine you're using
[04:02:14] <Cork> doebi: but generally, you would have to remove the code that does that
[04:02:24] <snufft> i've got an event attached to a menu icon, which runs preventDefault when clicked and then another event which also runs preventDefault. the problem is that when the second event runs which calls preventDefault, the click event on the menu icon still runs
[04:03:08] <snufft> is there a way to preventDefault().preventDefault() :P
[04:03:10] <Cork> snufft: so i guess you're using a timer?
[04:03:21] <Cork> else you couldn't get that effect
[04:03:36] <snufft> Cork, no. (well, not intentionally if I am).
[04:03:55] <Cork> snufft: could you try to reproduce the problem in jsfiddle?
[04:04:12] <snufft> Cork, sure, i'll give it a shot :)
[04:04:17] <snufft> might take a while :P
[04:04:40] <Cork> you might solve your own problem :)
[04:04:58] <snufft> haha, possibly! or do a workaround :P
[04:10:07] <CocoStorm> anyone familiar with leanModal or angularjs?

[05:45:43] <jeffreylevesque> i don't want to load every script in my <head> tag.  I want to conditionally populate them if possible
[05:46:03] <jeffreylevesque> maybe I append the <script> tags to the DOM conditionally?
[05:50:29] <LoonaTick> Hi. I've been trying to find this on Google but so far no luck (maybe I'm not searching for the right terms). With jqplot I have a line graph with several lines. I would like to show the label of the selected line on mouseover on one tick. Does anybody by any chance know if this is possible out of the box?
[05:51:08] <LoonaTick> the label of the series of the selected line**
[06:30:21] <Nyoom> anyone now?
[06:30:51] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: Always people here. Just ask your question and if anyone can help they more than likely will.
[06:31:01] <Nyoom> Well yesterday no one was here xD
[06:31:18] <Nyoom> <Nyoom> What am I doing wrong here? https://lua-documentation-c9-jordynl.c9.io/ it just doesn't want to make a data Table of it :(
[06:32:57] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: There's an error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'mData' of undefined"
[06:33:54] <Nyoom> Is that in DataTables.js?
[06:33:58] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[06:34:12] <Nyoom> They published a broken version then >_<
[06:35:44] <Nyoom> Idk how to fix that :<
[06:37:32] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: I'd slim down those tables and be careful of colspan and rowspan. Make sure the data makes sense.
[06:38:24] <dglambert> hey hey
[06:39:33] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: You have things like <tr><td>One</tr></tr><tr><td>One</td><td>Two</td><td>Three</td></tr> which I'm sure can e throwing it off.
[06:40:09] <BillCriswell> Trim that table down to what's needed, remove all <font>, <b>, <centers>s and just use CSS to do that styling.
[06:54:07] <Nyoom> BillCriswell, https://lua-documentation-c9-jordynl.c9.io/ I did but it still doesn't work
[06:57:03] <mgblandy> Hi I've installed a template for a new website and it works great but jquery menu isn't working. When I reduce the size of the browser it should appear for mobiles... Instead a gap just appears where it should be but there is no menu there. Can anybody please help with a fix? The website is http://www.staysyork.com
[06:57:13] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: On that second row try adding colspan="3"
[06:58:12] <Nyoom> Like so?
[06:59:27] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: Do it on the <td>s with tfm and exec
[07:00:18] <Nyoom> done
[07:00:20] <Nyoom> still doesn't work
[07:02:28] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: You need a <thead> and <tbody> for datatables.
[07:02:51] <BillCriswell> I'm also not sure what's going to happen with those two colspan="3" <td>s.
[07:03:03] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/20273/uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-mdata-of-undefined
[07:04:50] <Macaveli> I have a fancybox, is it possible influence the window behind the fancybox?
[07:07:39] <Nyoom> BillCriswell, https://lua-documentation-c9-jordynl.c9.io/ almost there xD
[07:07:57] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: Sweet.
[07:08:55] <Nyoom> Yet it doesn't seem to work well xD
[07:09:13] <Nyoom> It doesn't add the table between the thead and tfoot
[07:10:16] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: Just make sure you read through the documentation.
[07:12:04] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: Not sure what you mean by influence.
[07:12:24] <Macaveli> BillCriswell reload.
[07:12:59] <Macaveli> BillCriswell reload the window
[07:13:17] <BillCriswell> You want to reload the page but keep the fancybox up?
[07:13:45] <Macaveli> Yes BillCriswell
[07:15:10] <BillCriswell> You can't reload the full page since fancybox is a part of that page, but you'd be able to reload certain content within the page using ajax.
[07:20:03] <Nyoom> BillCriswell, could you help me out one more time
[07:20:11] <Nyoom> The error it gives doesn't certainly help me
[07:21:22] <BillCriswell> The error that gives you a url to a webpage describing how to get rid of it?
[07:21:57] <Nyoom> Yeah but I don't understand that page
[07:22:20] <Nyoom> I need to add colspan to row 0 ?
[07:23:57] <BillCriswell> I'd just try it and see. Those rows at the top of the table can't be making things easy, though.
[07:26:46] <Nyoom> How so?
[07:26:53] <Nyoom> It's valid HTML I thought :|
[07:28:00] <BillCriswell> Nyoom: Yeah but sorting those rows is awkward. Just try taking out the exec and tfm rows and see how it works. If it works then display that information without messing with the table.
[07:28:49] <Nyoom> Oh
[07:28:56] <Nyoom> You're talking about the "&nbsp;" tagS?
[07:29:38] <BillCriswell> I'm talking about thr entire row the "exec" and "tfm" text is in.
[07:29:56] <BillCriswell> entire rows*
[08:15:33] <gojko> hy, can someone help me with my problem, http://jsfiddle.net/2j82kd9u/ here is my code if i add selects in one div like in header  and if i select in each select other options and if i press add again, all my selected states gets reseted...
[08:20:33] <edrahn> I'm trying to get a list of checkbox's that are checked on a pag
[08:20:36] <edrahn> page
[08:20:43] <edrahn> how do I do this?
[08:21:01] <edrahn> is(':checked') doesn't seem to filter
[08:21:53] <BillCriswell> edrahn: $(':checked') would get them for the whole page.
[08:22:24] <BillCriswell> is() wouldn't do anything since it filters a collection... so you'd need to do like $('input').is(':checked') to use .is(':checked')
[08:22:38] <BillCriswell> Though, just $(':checked') would do what you want.
[08:22:44] <edrahn> BillCriswell: thanks :)
[08:23:18] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:31:36] <gojko> what is wrong here, that when i select like volvo and press add new it resets volvo to saab? http://jsfiddle.net/p6yw7aem/
[08:37:45] <BillCriswell> gojko: Volvo?
[08:37:58] <gojko> click on add new
[08:38:04] <gojko> select volvo, click again on add new
[08:38:11] <gojko> it will set volvo to saab
[08:39:15] <BillCriswell> When I clic add the select is empty.
[08:40:14] <gojko> click again
[08:41:17] <BillCriswell> I feel like I'd be more helpful here if I understood what you were going for.
[08:42:42] <gojko> BillCriswell click add select it will fill with data from array with Saab, Volvo, Bmw, if you select option Volvo, click again add new it will reset previous selected Volvo to Saab
[08:42:50] <gojko> do you understand now?
[08:43:54] <BillCriswell> When I click "Add" I get an empty select first.
[08:44:12] <BillCriswell> If I click it twice it'll populate the first generated select with the values.
[08:44:17] <gojko> ok there is bug, but dont worry about that, click wtice yes..
[08:44:52] <gojko> yes if you select here like Bmw or Volvo and again click add new it will reset this selected option to Saab
[08:44:59] <BillCriswell> Right.
[08:45:41] <gojko> now that is my main problem... if i make like 20 selects it will reset it all over when i add new one..
[08:46:59] <BillCriswell> gojko: Are you regenerating all those selects again?
[08:47:16] <gojko> yes...
[08:47:27] <gojko> after i make all select it saves in db..
[08:47:39] <krambiorix> hi, i have a table where the user can add rows with a button. In each table row i have some radio buttons : yes / no  ... But i can't make it work with multiple rows .... http://jsfiddle.net/8hw2ykug/
[08:48:15] <Horacsio> Hi I'm using Validator Plugin which have localization... yet as I'm a rookie: can anyone explain how do I activate localization? :S
[08:48:22] <BillCriswell> gojko: If you recreate them it's going to select the first option again. You probably want to just create the new row instead.
[08:48:34] <gojko> yey offcourse
[08:48:41] <gojko> only new row, not all others
[08:50:46] <Horacsio> hello?
[08:51:16] <BillCriswell> gojko: So do you want help cloning the last row and appending it?
[08:51:23] <krambiorix> anyone?
[08:52:24] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Two buttons in each row should have the same name.
[08:53:00] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/8hw2ykug/1/
[08:53:18] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, so when i add a row, i have to give them a new name?
[08:53:29] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Yes.
[08:53:53] <BillCriswell> If you have 20 radio buttons with the same name only one can be active.
[08:54:51] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, thanks!
[08:56:00] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:07:57] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning #jquery
[09:08:18] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyyyy
[09:21:54] <Jattenalle> [laugh track]
[09:29:39] <Horacsio> Hi I'm using Validator Plugin which have localization... yet as I'm a rookie: can anyone explain how do I activate localization? :S
[09:38:34] <Horacsio> some help here please
[09:41:49] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7091206/jquery-validation-internationalization-problem second answer here ( the part where he talks about writing your own ) seems pretty useful.
[09:44:02] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: In order to just "activate" it for a particular language you can just include the locale file. https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/tree/master/src/localization
[09:44:29] <Horacsio> I have it... but... not working :S
[09:44:45] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio then show us what you DO have ;)
[09:45:10] <Horacsio> bias.baannng.com/#biascontact
[09:49:15] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: I don't see any language files?
[09:49:54] <BillCriswell> Ugh scrolljack.
[09:50:13] <Horacsio> its under /js/Validator/localization
[09:50:40] <BillCriswell> Not seeing that.
[09:51:14] <Horacsio> should I call it under <script>?
[09:51:45] <BillCriswell> What?
[09:52:39] <MikeD_> I can return false in the event handler if event.which == 13 to prevent form submission from input+enter... can I make the enter key act like tab?  (it's an intranet app)
[09:52:58] <MikeD_> normally i'd say that's a horrible UI intention
[09:53:18] <MikeD_> well, i'd still say that... but i know they're going to ask for it to work "like excel"
[09:53:19] <Horacsio> BillCriswell: I don't know how to call the localization. It's uploaded
[09:53:33] <Horacsio> I call the validator plugins with <script>
[09:53:55] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ don't return false to prevent default actions - use e.preventDefault() instead.
[09:54:22] <BillCriswell> Yes, just include it with the script tag.
[09:54:23] <Horacsio> should I call the localization with a <script> too or do I reposition the files in same folder as the plugin?
[09:54:34] <MikeD_> robertmaxrees: i was curious about that too... why?
[09:54:35] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: Doesn't matter.
[09:55:11] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ return false; is implicit - if you later go on and refactor your code, you'll get all kinds of interesting side effects.  explicitly cancel the event instead.
[09:55:36] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ also: http://jsfiddle.net/TnEB5/3/
[09:56:46] <MikeD_> thanks
[09:56:53] <robertmaxrees> found that on google ;)
[09:57:10] <MikeD_> what'd you search?
[09:57:20] <robertmaxrees> javascript enter key like tab
[09:57:28] <MikeD_> ah, k
[09:57:30] <robertmaxrees> it was the second result i think?
[09:57:37] <robertmaxrees> Stack Overflow answer.
[10:12:47] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: what up bro
[10:13:27] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[10:14:43] <wa5ted> morning
[10:14:46] <wa5ted> whats up with you
[10:15:43] <wa5ted> lol you should have seen this dude yesterday, asks a question in the morning about some webuimanager being undefined, i tell him to look for if the library is called before when he calls it to be used, hes ask the same bloody question 6 hours later XD
[10:16:45] <robertmaxrees> that happens all the time.
[10:17:54] <BillCriswell> Not sure people always get notifications.
[10:18:19] <BillCriswell> With the join/part action in this channel it can be a pain to scroll back.
[10:18:44] <MikeD_> robertmaxrees: if the next input isn't a sibling of the one taking the enter keystroke, .next('input') doesn't get there...  what do I use instead?
[10:18:56] <MikeD_> i'm looking at nextall() that seems crazy
[10:19:07] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to find some way to identify them in order.
[10:19:10] <BillCriswell> I'd like to see statistics on the users who are in here and how much they've said in the channel's history.
[10:19:25] <MikeD_> what kind of statistics?
[10:20:16] <BillCriswell> Just people who come in here every day and don't say a word. I know I'm guilty of that on plenty of channels haha
[10:20:17] <robertmaxrees> like, how much each user has said, etc, since the beginning of time.
[10:20:46] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/ <- there are your logs for mining.
[10:20:47] <MikeD_> don't bots sometimes track "seen" or "since" or whatever?
[10:20:55] <MikeD_> !seen
[10:20:56] <decx> normally 800 users with about 20 regulars and an ever changing barrage of questioneers
[10:21:11] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Yeah, wouldn't be that tough to parse either.
[10:21:19] <BillCriswell> The thing is though. I'm really fucking lazy.
[10:21:44] <MikeD_> heh, "If I don't get paid, I aint interested"
[10:21:57] <decx> irc stats analysis always made me realize i spend too much time in irc anyway
[10:22:36] <BillCriswell> I don't mind not getting paid oddly enough. I just... need to care a little more. I know I bought it up but my interest comes and goes quick.
[10:22:36] <MikeD_> right, when your beer score exceeds a case, you've probably been helping too much
[10:22:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, definitely.
[10:24:00] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: i dont get those message :(
[10:24:02] <wa5ted> in this channel
[10:24:04] <wa5ted> so frustrating
[10:24:06] <wa5ted> brb lunch
[10:37:02] <Horacsio> BillCriswell: thank you. sorry I forgot to thank you :)
[10:38:29] <BillCriswell> Horacsio: No problem!
[10:42:37] <FernandoBasso> Can I use setInterval(fn, time) and change the value of time inside fn so that it runs every `time` each time?
[10:42:52] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:43:39] <FernandoBasso> Basically, I'm running setInterval(), and inside it I have another setInterval(). The outer setInterval() should run immediately in the first time, and wait more from the second time on.
[10:43:54] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[10:44:21] <FernandoBasso> Because the algorithm for a situation I have here requires that.
[10:45:35] <robertmaxrees> that sounds very unusual - if you're doing animations check out .delay(), otherwise what you really want to use setTimeout() and call that instead.
[10:54:34] <decx> would be interesting to see animation stuff that requires stacked intervals
[10:55:37] <decx> i'm going out on a limb here and proclaim it's an obtuse approach
[10:56:56] <robertmaxrees> wonder what they're doing that requires modifying the timeouts of things.
[10:59:29] <BillCriswell> It's amazing how badly this CSS is done. ='(
[11:03:17] <BillCriswell> line-height: 0; everywhere
[11:03:19] <BillCriswell> WHHYYYY
[11:04:12] <MikeD_> because source whitespace screws some people up, line-height:0 is the "solution"
[11:04:38] <MikeD_> i didn't say it was a good reason
[11:05:14] <BillCriswell> There's like 10 different breakpoints in this CSS. It could have been at most 2.
[11:07:15] <BillCriswell> Big Business will soothe my soul.
[11:07:40] <erming> so, i want to implement an infinite scroll-thingie.. anyone can recommend me a plugin that does this: triggers an event when i
[11:07:46] <erming> i've scrolled to an element
[11:08:00] <erming> basically, i want to trigger a "Show more posts"-link click when i've scrolled to it
[11:08:10] <systemfault> line-height: 0 is often only necessary if you use the shitty inline-block to create columns.
[11:08:25] <systemfault> Just use floats… or better if you can, flexbox
[11:08:50] <BillCriswell> erming: Yeah that sounds about right for the site I'm working on.
[11:08:54] <BillCriswell> systemfault: *
[11:09:18] <erming> :( no help? :(((
[11:09:44] <systemfault> inline-block is awful for layouts… because if it breaks or not depends on the formatting of the HTML
[11:09:49] <BillCriswell> erming: I'll give you the peices. $(window).on('scroll') and $('#show-more-posts').offset().top
[11:10:07] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Yeah, totally udnerstand. Dev before me didn't. =(
[11:10:24] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Outch :(
[11:11:55] <BillCriswell> It doesn't matter. In two weeks I'll be at an all inclusive mexican resort getting drunk.
[11:12:57] <systemfault> F… yeah!
[11:13:27] <BillCriswell> I paid my random to the US and can officially leave the country.
[11:13:32] <BillCriswell> ransom*
[11:15:57] <decx> somebody actually used inline-block for layout?
[11:18:47] <BillCriswell> Just looked at the code a little closer and figured out why they did it.
[11:19:01] <BillCriswell> It was still the wrong way, but the spacing below an image.
[11:19:04] <decx> there is no why, only no
[11:19:13] <BillCriswell> Hahaha.
[11:19:30] <decx> what was display block on the image too hard
[11:19:33] <decx> ^^
[11:19:40] <BillCriswell> I geuss they just didn't know about it
[11:20:03] <decx> should be the first thing to show up for "space under image in div"
[11:20:04] <decx> ^^
[11:20:10] <BillCriswell> Fair point.
[11:20:49] <BillCriswell> Guessing he saw this one first: http://stackoverflow.com/a/13961130
[11:20:55] <decx> oh i guess vertical align works too
[11:20:56] <BillCriswell> evil.
[11:21:11] <decx> lol
[11:21:12] <BillCriswell> decx: That dude who answered that question used to school me in IRC like every day.
[11:21:23] <drej> you guys want a real answer?
[11:21:46] <BillCriswell> drej: I go with display: block typically. I've rarely needed an inline image lol
[11:21:54] <drej> an image is an inline element by default, which puts it on the baseline of text. the gap below the image is the space below the baseline that accomodates hanging characters (j,y,g,q, etc)
[11:22:26] <BillCriswell> drej: We know, the person who coded this site wasn't aware of that.
[11:22:27] <decx> hanging characters hehe
[11:22:32] <decx> it's called a descender
[11:22:34] <BillCriswell> I have line-height: 0; everywhere. =(
[11:22:39] <drej> no they're suicidal
[11:22:45] <drej> i missed the first part of the convo then
[11:23:09] <decx> bringing suicide into this? that is over the line
[11:23:16] <decx> *giggle*
[11:23:20] <drej> no, under the line
[11:23:20] <drej> :)
[11:23:24] <decx> damnit
[11:23:25] <decx> ^^
[11:23:26] <BillCriswell> Haaaaaaa
[11:23:36] <drej> </dadjokes>
[11:24:10] <decx> too clever
[11:24:25] <BillCriswell> Bought a scratch off today out of the blue, hit for $50, sweeeeeeeeet.
[11:24:50] <decx> the hell is a scratch off
[11:25:02] <decx> ah, idiot tax
[11:25:05] <BillCriswell> It's like a little lottery game.
[11:25:11] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes.
[11:25:20] <decx> well good for you
[11:25:23] <decx> ;D
[11:25:42] <Jattenalle> now exchange those $50 for 10 more tickets
[11:25:53] <decx> that's the ticket !
[11:25:53] <Jattenalle> just imagine, you could make it $500!
[11:25:59] <decx> math checks out
[11:26:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I'll pick one up like every 6 months. I typically hit for like the price of the ticket haha
[11:26:20] <Jattenalle> that's because that's how most of those are designed
[11:26:28] <Jattenalle> you're very likely to hit for the price of the ticket, or just under
[11:26:35] <Jattenalle> ie: $1 ticket, 90% chance to hit for $0.5
[11:26:47] <Jattenalle> but it gives you that "oh man, i won! it was just a bit low..." so you buy another one
[11:26:52] <Jattenalle> qed, poor house
[11:26:53] <BillCriswell> I never seen one hit for lower than the price of the ticket.
[11:27:07] <decx> then that business wouldnt exist
[11:27:43] <BillCriswell> This was a $5 one. I typically only do like $2 or $3 ones.
[11:28:08] <decx> should have gotten a 100$ one you could have 900 extra now
[11:28:19] <BillCriswell> decx: Oh, without a doubt.
[11:29:01] <Jattenalle> i never forget the one and only ticket i ever bought.. i was 9 or something, ended up winning.. they refused to cash it in because i was a minor... herp derp
[11:29:08] <Jattenalle> i still have the ticket somewhere
[11:29:23] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Do they expire?
[11:29:27] <Jattenalle> yeah
[11:29:30] <BillCriswell> That blows.
[11:29:50] <Jattenalle> i mean, it was "only" for 100SEK (~$20-ish) but for a 9yr old.. i was devastated
[11:29:53] <BillCriswell> Not smart enough to bribe someone at that age.
[11:30:17] <Jattenalle> my parents tried all kinds of things, but since the place that sold it knew i had bought it noone else could cash it in
[11:30:31] <Jattenalle> but i did end up getting some icecream from the stand across the ticket one
[11:30:33] <decx> at that age i always blew away all my money for useless shit too
[11:30:33] <Jattenalle> so all in all
[11:30:35] <Jattenalle> a win
[11:30:48] <BillCriswell> You should have been able to go to a different place to cash it in haha.
[11:30:56] <BillCriswell> Ah well glad you got ice cream out of it.
[11:30:59] <Jattenalle> nah, was at a carneval thing, could only cash there
[11:31:06] <BillCriswell> Ah, sucks.
[11:31:19] <decx> then at 12 i went on a class trip and my father gave me 30dmark, saying he doubled what i bring back, brought back 30 and have been cheap ever since
[11:31:26] <Jattenalle> i remebmer i was just so sad... "but i won"
[11:31:35] <Jattenalle> just couldnt understand why i didnt get the prize
[11:31:35] <BillCriswell> decx: Nice.
[11:31:44] <Jattenalle> lol decx
[11:32:38] <decx> is cheap a good word?
[11:32:42] <BillCriswell> My friend Drew gave me $20 when I went to vegas and told me to play black 5x time a row on roulette. Ended up winning each time and just told me to spend it on alcohol.
[11:32:48] <decx> translator says niggardly, that can't be right
[11:33:00] <BillCriswell> decx: Really? wow
[11:33:06] <Jattenalle> decx, i.. i dont think you have a good translator
[11:33:14] <decx> curmudgeonly
[11:33:33] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_word_%22niggardly%22
[11:33:43] <snover> i’m glad there is a wikipedia article about that
[11:33:51] <decx> i'm going to make up my own word with black jack and hookers and say scroogey
[11:33:58] <Jattenalle> oh i know the word BillCriswell, it's just never really used anymore
[11:34:10] <BillCriswell> I'd be terrified to say that word in public.
[11:35:22] <decx> then it slips out by acccident and behind you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZSXrYsfrKY
[11:36:05] <BillCriswell> decx: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFBnoCL2qU
[11:36:15] <decx> best quote
[11:36:43] <decx> sensational sherry just corpsing in the back
[11:36:43] <BillCriswell> Ugh, they edited too much. It's better when he says it and he just turns around around like "What did I just say..."
[11:37:10] <BillCriswell> So funny.
[11:37:31] <BillCriswell> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpvzuuq9xfs hahaha nice
[11:37:41] <Jattenalle> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrRvHkZLNtY
[11:37:50] <Jattenalle> from swedish children's movie Sunes Sommar
[11:38:41] <Jattenalle> the thing he's pointing at, is called a negerboll, literally: niggerball
[11:38:47] <Jattenalle> it is a delicious choclaty treat
[11:38:48] <thang> ಠ_ಠ
[11:40:10] <decx> hm chocolate salty balls
[11:40:24] <Jattenalle> nah, not salty, sweet
[11:40:31] <Jattenalle> with cocoa flakes on them
[11:40:35] <Jattenalle> or rough sugar
[11:40:45] <BillCriswell> Sounds pretty delicious.
[11:40:57] <Jattenalle> it is
[11:44:36] <robertmaxrees> holy woah it's already 11:45
[11:45:16] <BillCriswell> Today is movin'.
[11:45:26] <robertmaxrees> seriously.
[11:45:37] <robertmaxrees> trying to gsd bigtime, too.
[11:45:53] <decx> BillCriswell http://gfycat.com/InsidiousOrganicAmericanriverotter
[11:46:22] <BillCriswell> Booker T is awesome.
[11:46:30] <robertmaxrees> ! YES.
[11:46:57] <decx> man i love gfycats namingscheme
[11:47:23] <robertmaxrees> he did an album called Sound The Alarm - the title cut features one of my favorite musicians on it.  it was like everything converged to make something almost perfect.
[11:47:30] <BillCriswell> Do they just pick like 4 words from a dictionary?
[11:47:44] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Haha I'll need to look into that.
[11:47:58] <decx> ye something like that
[11:48:34] <decx> couple of adjectives and then a two part noun
[11:48:58] <Jattenalle> river otter
[11:49:20] <decx> sometimes it's a single word though so probably just a big dict
[11:49:27] <decx> *giggle*
[12:13:13] <scri66le> anyone know how to add php to a textarea or div via jquery?
[12:13:48] <Jattenalle> scri66le, uh?
[12:13:55] <scri66le> Jattenalle, http://pastebin.com/N2UiXbXk
[12:14:34] <Jattenalle> escape it and just put it in?
[12:15:05] <drej> Jattenalle computers are hard
[12:15:07] <Jattenalle> mydiv.text('php here');
[12:15:24] <Jattenalle> drej, not as hard as making babbys
[12:15:27] <robertmaxrees> scri66le as long as that php renders to HTML by the time you hit the page, you should be fine.
[12:15:34] <robertmaxrees> though i'm not sure what editor.insert() is,'
[12:15:36] <zeroquake> 100 class selector queries versus 1 dom node insertion --- which is more expensive?
[12:15:38] <drej> Jattenalle thats not that hard
[12:15:42] <scri66le> it's ace editor
[12:15:43] <drej> i mean ... some parts of it are hard
[12:15:46] <drej> ... giggidy
[12:15:50] <robertmaxrees> zeroquake depends.
[12:16:02] <Jattenalle> drej, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_RaPOOVX1Y
[12:16:04] <zeroquake> on?
[12:16:10] <robertmaxrees> complexity of the document.
[12:16:20] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: Selecting and adding are very different things?
[12:16:24] <robertmaxrees> redraw/repaint.
[12:16:31] <drej> Jattenalle classic
[12:16:31] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[12:16:41] <Jattenalle> drej, :D
[12:17:35] <zeroquake> the reason i ask is - i need to choose between hiding 100 divs versus building new container and inserting into dom
[12:18:07] <Jattenalle> zeroquake, inserting 100 divs into the dom is slower than hiding 100 existing ones
[12:18:35] <decx> i'm going to speculate that it's about either hiding 100 or just inserting the one that isnt hidden newly in a separate div
[12:18:41] <robertmaxrees> Jattenalle he could build out the fragment and insert it in one go.  still a slow operation.
[12:18:54] <zeroquake> yes decx
[12:19:01] <decx> bam!
[12:19:09] <decx> speculatron-5000
[12:19:13] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[12:19:32] <zeroquake> but overall it is just one insertion since full html is pre built
[12:19:33] <decx> what's in the divs that are hidden
[12:19:48] <decx> i'd say go for the insert
[12:19:57] <robertmaxrees> same here.
[12:20:26] <gojko> hy,can someone help me with my problem, i can't find solution, here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/p6yw7aem/, when i add new row if i select from select list like Bmw and if i later press Add, previus selected states are reseted and i get on all selects first option as selected?
[12:20:31] <zeroquake> can i know the reason ?
[12:20:47] <zeroquake> what do i look into to make approprite decisions on this
[12:21:00] <decx> run a test
[12:21:06] <scri66le> i made two vars, one is just '<' the other is the include
[12:21:09] <decx> http://jsperf.com/
[12:22:19] <Jattenalle> scri66le, mydiv.text('your php here'); just do that!
[12:22:39] <scri66le> Jattenalle, doesn't work for ace editor for some reason
[12:22:59] <zeroquake> if i want to learn about repaint etc , how html we insert is actually put into dom etc ? any websites u recommend?
[12:23:01] <Jattenalle> i dont know what ace editor is
[12:24:28] <robertmaxrees> scri66le is your PHP actually outputting markup?
[12:24:50] <scri66le> it's not getting inserted at all but with the two separate vars it works fine
[12:25:26] <BillCriswell> scri66le: Your PHP is parsing so you won't see it on the output probably.
[12:25:26] <robertmaxrees> scri66le is your js getting generated via your php?  like, can you show us what's actually getting rendered to the page?
[12:25:43] <BillCriswell> You can probably do &lt;?php echo "Boat"; ?>
[12:27:01] <robertmaxrees> ^^ probably this. you can't execute PHP on the page arbitrarily.
[12:27:38] <Jattenalle> i think the problem is that wahtever he's doing/using is treating the random php tags and characters as elements and opens/closes tags and such
[12:27:41] <Jattenalle> but who knows..
[12:27:43] * Jattenalle shrugs
[12:28:39] <gojko> BillCriswell, can you help me, i still doesnt find solution for my select tags?
[12:29:55] <BillCriswell> gojko: That was a while ago and I kind of forget what was going on.
[12:30:06] <gojko> http://jsfiddle.net/p6yw7aem/
[12:30:28] <gojko> if i select Bmw and add new row Bmw sets to first option in select
[12:31:17] <gojko> i mean, current selected options in all select are changed to first option, which is Saab
[12:31:23] <BillCriswell> Oh yeah.
[12:31:29] <decx> holy condensed codeblock batman
[12:31:55] <decx> i keep hitting tidy up but it doesnt get any more readable -.-
[12:33:02] <gojko> decx, are you talking about my code?
[12:33:26] <BillCriswell> gojko: It's pretty tough following your code. I'm going to make a bare bones example for you and you can add what you need from there.
[12:38:57] <BillCriswell> gojko: Is there more than one of these tables?
[12:39:45] <BillCriswell> gojko: I feel like if I understood the big picture better we could think of a better approach.
[12:39:48] <gojko> BillCriswell, yes they are header, left, content, right, footer, same system
[12:40:11] <BillCriswell> Is this like that god awful drupal admin panel for putting blocks in certain regions?
[12:40:12] <gojko> i only change id for tables else stays same
[12:40:34] <gojko> its my own system, which i am working at
[12:41:07] <gojko> but it is an idea as you thought, you adding blocks which are saved than to db
[12:41:36] <BillCriswell> So you have areas like "header", "left", "content" and in each of those you can have like multiple sections inside them?
[12:43:05] <gojko> BillCriswell, true
[12:44:44] <gojko> http://snag.gy/qhizm.jpg here is what it looks like right now
[12:45:29] <BillCriswell> You using Saab and BMW and shit threw me wayyyyy off.
[12:46:11] <gojko> soory its only for example... you can use anything else if it's too disturbed to you :)
[12:50:00] <buzzlewoo> anyone familiar with parsley data-parsley-mincheck="3" for checkboxes?
[12:50:38] <BillCriswell> gojko: http://jsbin.com/tijisozaxixe/1/edit?html,js,output something like this?
[12:50:51] <robertmaxrees> that's an... oddly specific question, buzzlewoo - mind just asking what you want to know
[12:50:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:51:17] <buzzlewoo> sure..I need to know how to require 1 checkbox and only 1 to be checked in order for a form to validate
[12:51:31] <buzzlewoo> I'm using a flavor of jquery called parsley
[12:51:55] <robertmaxrees> why not use a radio instead?
[12:52:10] <buzzlewoo> ah..because it's for homework and checkboxes are required
[12:52:29] <buzzlewoo> (I will later have to use radio buttons also)
[12:52:56] <robertmaxrees> that is a really bizarre idea.
[12:53:07] <buzzlewoo> why, thank you, robertmaxrees!
[12:53:36] <robertmaxrees> anyway, i'm not personally familiar with parsely, but something tells me you'll have to setup a custom validator.
[12:53:56] <buzzlewoo> I have the validator; unsure where it goes
[12:55:24] <gojko> BillCriswell yea that way, only few lines of code? damn you are good :)
[12:55:38] <gojko> ec
[12:55:58] <gojko> except one thing options are filled with json from db
[13:02:32] <BillCriswell> gojko: You can do something like this: http://jsbin.com/jedonacituro/1/edit
[13:02:55] <BillCriswell> Not sure what those numbers would mean. Are they always just ordered or does the number mean something?
[13:03:12] <gojko> they are just order numbers
[13:04:46] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/tijisozaxixe/2/edit?css,js
[13:04:49] <BillCriswell> weeee CSS counters.
[13:05:52] <BillCriswell> Oooo, doesn't update.
[13:05:54] <systemfault> Yeah, that’s one feature I never use :P
[13:06:15] <BillCriswell> Haha when you remove a row it doesn't update. I guess that makes sense though.
[13:06:56] <systemfault> Hmm, I would have expected it to refresh
[13:07:03] <drej> ive used counters
[13:07:06] <drej> recently too
[13:07:44] <BillCriswell> drej: I did as well... actually lead me to think there was a terrible bug in something but there wasn't haha
[13:07:47] <gojko> BillCriswell ok tq,will try to use it now
[13:07:59] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Is that code even using counters?
[13:08:16] <BillCriswell> I don't think I linked to the code I thought I was.
[13:09:14] <systemfault> BillCriswell: I think that the :before should have: content: counter(row);
[13:09:46] <BillCriswell> There it goes.
[13:09:57] <BillCriswell> I got mixed up with some urls
[13:10:30] <BillCriswell> systemfault: http://jsbin.com/mamusetipoqi/1/edit there we go
[13:11:12] <systemfault> Works fine
[13:11:27] <BillCriswell> YEah, that's what I was expecting.
[13:11:48] <BillCriswell> drej: What did you use counters for?
[13:12:24] <drej> BillCriswell a step-through for a checkout process
[13:12:51] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[13:13:57] <BillCriswell> I used them to correspond to some markers on a map, totally bit me in the ass. They were numbers 1-20 and skipped like... 8 for whatever reason from the database but the 8 was still in the info section so it took a while to catch.
[13:13:59] <mdev> http://imgur.com/gallery/wR3ZxfB
[13:14:18] <BillCriswell> mdev: I think you'd need like 8 of them.
[13:14:28] <mdev> lol
[13:16:05] <systemfault> http://elabs.se.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/picture/file/81/normal_php_-_the_good_parts.jpeg :)
[13:16:23] <BillCriswell> Hahahahahaha that mosquito is perfect
[13:17:42] <robertmaxrees> "it's not as bad as classic asp" lmao
[13:17:55] <drej> ahaha
[13:19:17] <tpyo> is the latest autocomplete working from jquery UI?
[13:19:27] <tpyo> the function is an empty string instead of a function
[13:19:40] <tpyo> and the docs on their site seem to think its a function
[13:20:05] <funnybunny> hey guys.. i found this object in my dom tree:
[13:20:07] <funnybunny> jQuery172027059482609921404 Object { events={...}, toJSON=function(), handle=function()}
[13:20:13] <tpyo> i read on SO that there is possibly a clash somewhere but the person didn't state what clashes so I don't know what to remove from the custom builder
[13:20:26] <funnybunny> i can't seem to find out why it is there, any ideas?
[13:25:01] <robertmaxrees> funnybunny caching probably.
[13:25:08] <funnybunny> caching?
[13:25:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery creates cached copies of things to reduce lookup times on occasion.
[13:25:54] <funnybunny> do you have any sort of documentation link for this?
[13:26:15] <tpyo> I have the value: 4 "cached" under the same sort of thing in one of my jquery elements I just output to the console
[13:26:42] <robertmaxrees> funnybunny start here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3316991/jquery-is-adding-a-strange-attribute-to-nodes
[13:28:40] <funnybunny> thanks robertmaxrees
[13:28:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:29:00] <funnybunny> i found this on the way: http://jsperf.com/caching-jquery-selectors
[13:29:06] <funnybunny> looks interesting
[13:29:32] <robertmaxrees> funnybunny yeah - always cache selectors.
[13:32:16] <robertmaxrees> git status
[13:32:17] <robertmaxrees> woops
[13:33:34] <drej> if you need to use it more than once, cache the selector
[13:33:38] <drej> thats basically the rule of thumb
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> I often cache anyway.
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> for more meaningful names.
[13:34:11] <drej> well, yeah, there's the code-cleanliness aspect of it :)
[13:50:39] <overtime> #join temp
[13:50:47] <overtime> #j temp
[13:51:11] <Jattenalle> aaw, that's adorable :)
[13:51:16] <Jattenalle> overtime, /join #temp
[13:51:37] <overtime> jattenalle, thanks ;)
[13:56:31] <ElysiumNet> does jquery mind if there is a <body> or <html> tag in the HTML I'm trying to feed it?
[13:58:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:00:06] <robertmaxrees> ElysiumNet not particularly, though I wonder what you mean by "feed it"?
[14:00:37] <ElysiumNet> robertmaxrees: I'm basically trying to imitate $.load(), but without having to append it to the document immediately
[14:01:24] <robertmaxrees> that should be fine - why are you avoiding that append operation?
[14:02:09] <ElysiumNet> robertmaxrees: because I need to do some additional work on it before appending it
[14:02:19] <robertmaxrees> ElysiumNet fair enouugh.
[14:03:03] <decx> load is just ajax in a suit, so use ajax and do whatever with your data
[14:03:15] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:03:18] <robertmaxrees> "in a suit" i like it.
[14:03:19] <ElysiumNet> data.responseText contains what I need, but when I do $(data.responseText).html() (Simple sanity check) it returns "undefined"
[14:03:36] <robertmaxrees> are you in a callback for the ajax call?
[14:03:41] <ElysiumNet> $(data.responseText) returns with the attribute context as undefined
[14:03:47] <ElysiumNet> robertmaxrees: yes
[14:04:12] <ElysiumNet> and yes, the HTML is valid
[14:05:45] <robertmaxrees> console.log(data.responseText) <-- what does this give you?
[14:05:53] <ElysiumNet> robertmaxrees: the HTML I am expecting
[14:06:03] <ElysiumNet> $.load() works just fine with the same page
[14:06:24] <robertmaxrees> what options are you passing to $.ajax()?
[14:06:45] <ElysiumNet> just url, datatype and success
[14:07:04] <robertmaxrees> btw success is deprecated.
[14:07:40] <robertmaxrees> what do you have for dataType
[14:07:58] <mdev> why they "deprecate" it, other than "they can"
[14:08:11] <ElysiumNet> robertmaxrees: html
[14:08:19] <mdev> did they bother to ask the community if they wanted it "deprecated" before they went and changed it, I bet not
[14:08:26] <ElysiumNet> but nevermind, it magically started to work. I wonder how long it will keep this ujp
[14:08:32] <robertmaxrees> they're moving to using promises/deferred objects under the hood for all things async
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> mdev it's actually a really good idea overall.
[14:08:47] <robertmaxrees> ElysiumNet interesting.
[14:08:56] <ElysiumNet> robertmaxrees: so what is success supposed to be replaced with now?
[14:09:11] <robertmaxrees> chain .done() onto the call instead.
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done();
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> success, error, and complete are all deprecated.
[14:10:33] <devslash_> I have an html page with the code formatted like this: <HTML><HEAD></HEAD><FRAMESET rows="91,91%"><frame ...><frame ...></frameset> (The dots indicate extra irrelevant code). Is there a way to mnipulate the rows property of the <frameset> tag using jquery ?
[14:10:50] <ElysiumNet> robertmaxrees: meh, I'll leave that with the other project. now it's time to figure out why outerHTML is empty
[14:10:57] <robertmaxrees> $('frameset').prop('rows', '15000');
[14:11:18] <robertmaxrees> ElysiumNet it's trivial to update, but okay.
[14:11:35] <devslash_> that doesnt work prop isnt a function
[14:11:50] <robertmaxrees> devslash then you don't have jquery included on the page.
[14:12:59] <scrAz> anyone know how ot search the whole page for a specific string, like finding a shortcode for instance?? @@shortcode@@
[14:13:26] <robertmaxrees> scrAz whaaaa that's going to be super slow.
[14:13:35] <thinkxl> scrAz: "string".indexOf("st") < -1" maybe
[14:13:42] <scrAz> why robertmaxrees
[14:13:49] <thinkxl> but yea, it's going to be slow
[14:13:58] <robertmaxrees> scrAz you'll have to manually parse through the entire document manual;ly.
[14:13:59] <scrAz> what is better to do?
[14:14:10] <robertmaxrees> that's a very slow process.  back up and explain why you want to do that.
[14:14:23] <thinkxl> maybe there is a better solution
[14:14:50] <scrAz> i have a textbox with text in it. I want ot put a shortcode in it, save it in a DB and then output in on another page, Ont hat page I want to find that shortcode and reference another partial / snippet of code.
[14:15:07] <thinkxl> wut
[14:15:17] <scrAz> like wordpress' shortcodes
[14:15:26] <thinkxl> gotcha
[14:15:26] <robertmaxrees> why not do that in your backend?
[14:15:33] <scrAz> in php robertmaxrees ?
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> sure
[14:15:42] <robertmaxrees> whatever backend you have.
[14:15:51] <scrAz> is there a function for that in PHP?
[14:16:11] <robertmaxrees> dunno - i don't use it, but what you're doing is much better suited for backend processing.
[14:16:39] <robertmaxrees> doing that in the frontend will require parsing things out even if you're able to reduce the set of things you want to operate against
[14:16:41] <devslash_> robertmaxrees: i got it worknig thanks
[14:17:35] <robertmaxrees> scrAz if you DO have a really compelling reason for doing that in the frontend (even though it'll be really slow), check out http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ - you'll use this to find the containing element.
[14:32:05] <kara_sweets> hey guys lets say i click a button that has a jquery click event tied to it
[14:32:17] <kara_sweets> the button disappears when clicked
[14:32:21] <kara_sweets> some other stuff happens
[14:32:33] <kara_sweets> and then the button comes back with the same css selector as before
[14:32:44] <kara_sweets> now when clicked the jquery doesn't trigger
[14:32:48] <kara_sweets> do you have to rebind it?
[15:13:40] <robertmaxrees> kara_sweets you either have to re-bind it or use event delegation.
[15:13:49] <robertmaxrees> (the latter is the smarter option btw)
[15:14:36] <robertmaxrees> or just .hide() the button instead of removing it.
[15:17:07] <kara_sweets> how would i use event delegation
[15:17:34] <kara_sweets> i added the click event o body
[15:17:36] <kara_sweets> to*
[15:17:39] <kara_sweets> which seems to be working nicely
[15:17:55] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for .on() - they explain it.  the basic gist is $('parent').on('click', 'child', function() {}); <- "child" would be your current handler and "parent" would be something that exists on pageload.
[15:18:11] <robertmaxrees> avoid binding to "body" if you can since that will filter every click event.
[15:19:15] <kara_sweets> robertmaxrees: woot! awesome, thanks for the help.. learned something ew
[15:19:17] <kara_sweets> new*
[15:19:32] <kara_sweets> i binded to a parent div instead
[15:19:37] <kara_sweets> unique to that button
[15:19:54] <robertmaxrees> good call.
[15:20:02] <robertmaxrees> as long as that parent persists, you're fine.
[15:22:09] <frank_o> Cork: this svg > html event bubbling you mentioned earlier not being normal -- is that intentional or a bug that'll eventually get fixed?
[15:22:21] <SuperPhly> I've got a menu that uses .show() and .hide() on the mobile/phone display, but since it applies the style inline, it overrides my desktop styling by the inline style "display:none". Without detecting window resize events, what's the best way to get around that?
[15:22:30] <SuperPhly> I'm doing a class add/remove that I can over ride.
[15:22:53] <SuperPhly> Only problem there is that I can't do css animations with display/opacity
[15:26:17] <robertmaxrees> SuperPhly huh?  do you mean you only want the .hide() to do its thing on mobile but do something different on desktop?
[15:27:05] <SuperPhly> it will only occur on mobile as it is right now. The problem is that it applies the style inline, so if the user goes from a small screen to a big screen, the inline styles over ride the desktop styles.
[15:27:42] <SuperPhly> it's more of a design pattern i'm looking for
[15:27:53] <SuperPhly> because i understand the limitations and why it's breaking
[15:29:20] <robertmaxrees> use media queries.
[15:29:32] <robertmaxrees> and apply classes instead of the explicit hide/show
[15:29:43] <SuperPhly> robertmaxrees: i already am. but i can't over rule the inline styles that jquery applies.
[15:29:52] <SuperPhly> right, that's what i'm doing now.
[15:30:02] <SuperPhly> it just sucks that i can't use .show/.hide
[15:30:31] <robertmaxrees> they're doing what they're meant to do.
[15:32:41] <frank_o> SuperPhly: https://github.com/WickyNilliams/enquire.js/ maybe
[15:33:28] <frank_o> cant live without it :S
[15:37:34] <Yaazkal> Hi, I'm having a weird issue with ImageMapster plugin, I've created an StackOverflow question if anyone can check. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25253516/when-using-image-map-with-imagemapster-jquery-plugin-the-coords-are-changed
[15:40:26] <ElysiumNet> Yaazkal: are both images the same size?
[15:40:55] <tejas-manohar> hey my client wants the text that shows in an input field to always show as CAPITALIZED
[15:40:59] <tejas-manohar> no matter what the user types
[15:41:01] <tejas-manohar> how does this work?
[15:41:10] <ElysiumNet> tejas-manohar: text-transform?
[15:41:32] <tejas-manohar> yeah seems like it how do i do this to an input field as a user is typing?
[15:42:09] <ElysiumNet> tejas-manohar: http://jsfiddle.net/w85ds19g/
[15:42:16] <SuperPhly> frank_o: wowowowowow
[15:42:37] <tejas-manohar> ElysiumNet: does it actually submit text as uppercase too?
[15:43:06] <ElysiumNet> tejas-manohar: no, but why does that matter?
[15:43:12] <tejas-manohar> no it doesnt i was just checking
[15:43:27] <tejas-manohar> ElysiumNet: how do i prevent the placeholder from taking in this effect?
[15:44:03] <ElysiumNet> oh, you want that
[15:45:51] <tejas-manohar> ElysiumNet: well i just want it on the actual stuff the user types
[15:45:55] <tejas-manohar> UPERCASE
[15:45:57] <tejas-manohar> not on the palceholder
[15:46:20] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple javascript function to do that.
[15:46:37] <buzzlewoo> is there a jquery method to require User to check at least 1 checkbox in a checkbox group?
[15:47:00] <robertmaxrees> buzzlewoo no.  you'd need an extra plugin for that
[15:47:20] <buzzlewoo> what do you mean an extra plugin?
[15:47:44] <robertmaxrees> buzzlewoo i mean you'll need a plugin or you'll have to write that functionality yourself.
[15:47:53] <buzzlewoo> I see..
[15:47:57] <buzzlewoo> ok thank you
[15:50:07] <ElysiumNet> tejas-manohar: http://jsfiddle.net/w85ds19g/2/
[15:51:42] <tejas-manohar> ElysiumNet: what is the js for
[15:52:04] <ElysiumNet> ...
[15:54:31] <tejas-manohar> ElysiumNet: imnot the best with it and dont understand it at this time
[15:54:34] <tejas-manohar> would you epxlain?
[15:54:49] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar step through it piece by piece and ask us specific questions :)
[16:14:54] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:33:31] <Yaazkal> ElysiumNet: yes, both image are same size
[16:41:04] <tejas-manohar> whats a quick way to see if an input field has any value
[16:41:19] <tejas-manohar> moreover how do i grab the value of an input field
[16:44:47] <robertmaxrees> $('input').val() to get the value.
[16:44:54] <robertmaxrees> you can check the length of the returned string.
[16:46:13] <guide_X> is there a way to add an option to a select list, at the specified location?
[16:46:23] <guide_X> for instance, what if I wanted to add below the first item
[16:47:04] <tejas-manohar> im doing some quick validation without a plugin, how do i abort a post request in the case of failed validation
[16:47:13] <tejas-manohar> like onclick for the submit button calls my function
[16:47:32] <robertmaxrees> guide_X sure - check out .after()
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar you don't - start by binding to the form's submit event and run preventDefault() against the event object, then start your validation magic.
[16:48:09] <guide_X> robertmaxrees: oh cool thanks
[16:48:26] <tejas-manohar> sorry irc client just quit
[16:48:31] <tejas-manohar> what was that method?
[16:48:49] <robertmaxrees> bind to the form's submit event and run preventDefault() against the event object, then start your validation magic.
[16:49:14] <guide_X> robertmaxrees: do you know what that might look like in code?
[16:49:30] <guide_X> I have a select list full of options, I wish to insert a new option below the first one
[16:49:44] <robertmaxrees> guide_X which part is tripping you up?
[16:50:06] <guide_X> well I can only insert one before the first with prepend, or at the end with append
[16:50:15] <guide_X> with 'next' I'm not sure how that would work
[16:50:28] <robertmaxrees> guide_X use .after(), like I said.
[16:51:21] <Yaazkal> ElysiumNet: any idea about what can happen?
[16:51:22] <guide_X> ah ok, so maybe like $("#s option:first").after("<option>...</option>");
[16:51:39] <guide_X> i'll try it thanks
[16:51:43] <robertmaxrees> guide_X sure.  or $('#s option').eq(1).after();
[16:52:23] <guide_X> that totally works, thanks
[16:52:31] <guide_X> the .after I mean
[16:53:22] <robertmaxrees> try using .eq() instead of :first btw
[16:54:02] <tejas-manohar> $(‘.class’).val();
[16:54:07] <tejas-manohar> and thats how u get it right?
[16:54:13] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar that's how you get the first one, yeah.
[16:54:18] <tejas-manohar> yeah
[16:55:42] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: can i do if(!(one && two)) to only run following code if one and two have values
[16:55:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:55:57] <tejas-manohar> o
[16:55:58] <tejas-manohar> what is it
[16:56:02] <robertmaxrees> what is what?
[16:56:10] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: whats wrong with that code
[16:56:17] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar clarify what you mean.
[16:56:31] <tejas-manohar> to see if strings one and two have values
[16:56:34] <tejas-manohar> any value
[16:56:42] <tejas-manohar> i want to do if(!(one && two))
[16:56:52] <robertmaxrees> that doens't make sense.
[16:56:55] <tejas-manohar> why?
[16:56:58] <robertmaxrees> if (stringOne.length && stringTwo.length) {}
[16:57:23] <tejas-manohar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/154059/how-do-you-check-for-an-empty-string-in-javascript
[16:57:24] <tejas-manohar> o
[16:57:26] <tejas-manohar> ok
[16:57:31] <tejas-manohar> oh nvmdf
[16:57:34] <tejas-manohar> wait
[16:57:39] <tejas-manohar> why doesnt that work?
[16:58:00] <robertmaxrees> ! is negation.
[16:59:15] <robertmaxrees> if (!(stringOne && stringTwo)) { just seems really awkward.  do an explicit length check at that point.
[16:59:49] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: alright how do i clear a form in jquery
[17:00:01] <robertmaxrees> try searching google for the answer to that one first.
[17:00:04] <tejas-manohar> ok
[17:00:16] <tejas-manohar> and there isnt any jquery or betteer solution than settimeout
[17:00:25] <tejas-manohar> to sleep() (like in php) my code
[17:00:27] <tejas-manohar> for a few seconds
[17:00:30] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[17:02:36] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: nevermind got it, how does this seem? http://pastebin.com/r1z5H1AX
[17:02:56] <robertmaxrees> not going to work.
[17:03:01] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: why?
[17:03:11] <robertmaxrees> preventDefault(); isn'
[17:03:19] <robertmaxrees> *isn't being run against the event object.
[17:03:35] <robertmaxrees> and this isn't what I suggested anyway.
[17:03:48] <robertmaxrees> what browsers do you need to support?
[17:04:26] <robertmaxrees> also, your variable names are wrong.
[17:06:52] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: i was using html5 required
[17:06:56] <tejas-manohar> but iOS mobile
[17:08:11] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: cant i just return false?
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:08:39] <robertmaxrees> I mean, you could, but that's a bad way to do what you want.
[17:09:03] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: oh, http://pastebin.com/9baMn4NW ?
[17:09:12] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[17:09:58] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[17:10:12] <robertmaxrees> still not going to do what you want.
[17:10:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/avcfgtpy/
[17:10:23] <robertmaxrees> this is closer.
[17:10:31] <robertmaxrees> use document ready instead of window load.
[17:10:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to prevent the default submit event always.
[17:11:10] <robertmaxrees> your if/else needs to be turned inside out, etc.
[17:11:14] <robertmaxrees> take a look at what I pasted.
[17:11:52] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: ah that should do the trikck
[17:11:54] <tejas-manohar> i get it
[17:12:03] <robertmaxrees> are you ajaxing the form?
[17:12:12] <robertmaxrees> or will you be doing a normal form submit?
[17:12:13] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: no
[17:12:16] <tejas-manohar> normal submit
[17:12:19] <tejas-manohar> well angular
[17:12:41] <tejas-manohar> but normal submit pretty much
[17:12:58] <robertmaxrees> no idea how angular does it, but you'll need to setup a test to see if the event was syntheticall triggered or not, and trigger a form submit in the else block.
[17:14:29] <tejas-manohar> http://pastebin.com/tscTcqRU
[17:14:49] <robertmaxrees> like I said, I don't know anything about angular.
[17:15:00] <robertmaxrees> also, if($('.resp-err')) { will always be true.
[17:15:35] <tejas-manohar> sorry changed it to .is(":visible")
[17:15:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:15:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:16:17] <robertmaxrees> ah you're not adding them, you're hiding/showing as appropriate.
[17:17:37] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: yep
[17:17:43] <tejas-manohar> they all start off with display: none
[17:18:03] <tejas-manohar> if i call $(".resp-err").show();
[17:18:06] <tejas-manohar> when its already visible
[17:18:08] <tejas-manohar> is there any issue?
[17:18:15] <robertmaxrees> nope/.
[17:18:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery checks for you.
[17:18:21] <tejas-manohar> and i should be able to put e.preventDefault(); udner the else without issue
[17:18:22] <tejas-manohar> right?
[17:18:37] <robertmaxrees> wrong.
[17:18:46] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: how do i do then
[17:18:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to always prevent the default action on normal submits, just like I shoed you.
[17:18:53] <robertmaxrees> *showed
[17:20:29] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: ok maybe this is totally wrong route
[17:20:36] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar it is not.
[17:20:41] <robertmaxrees> what are you lost on now?
[17:20:44] <tejas-manohar> no i meant the way im explaining
[17:20:52] <tejas-manohar> re-explaining
[17:21:00] <tejas-manohar> basically im just trying to prevent a normal POST request from the submit only if there is no input
[17:21:07] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:21:11] <robertmaxrees> that is exactly what we're doing.
[17:21:32] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: but its above the if and else right?
[17:21:39] <robertmaxrees> right. i explained this earlier.
[17:21:51] <tejas-manohar> i only want to do it if !one || !two
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:21:56] <tejas-manohar> im not sure i get it still :(
[17:22:15] <robertmaxrees> you always want to prevent the default event.  always.
[17:22:19] <robertmaxrees> not conditionally.
[17:22:32] <robertmaxrees> however, you need to know if you should run all of your logic or not.
[17:22:56] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: if i always prevent the default then  the POST is never sent?
[17:23:05] <tejas-manohar> how does the if and else matter then?
[17:23:09] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar re-read my last sentence.
[17:23:21] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: i read it
[17:23:28] <tejas-manohar> o
[17:23:32] <tejas-manohar> i need to check beforehand
[17:23:35] <tejas-manohar> and only execute the function
[17:23:35] <tejas-manohar> if
[17:23:39] <tejas-manohar> thats true
[17:24:00] <tejas-manohar> so i need two functions?
[17:24:11] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.  one sec.
[17:24:25] <tejas-manohar> not sure how i can do this, alright ill hold
[17:24:49] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty simple.
[17:25:19] <tejas-manohar> you show example? im kinda lost about how to do it if i cant put if and else with e.preventdefault underneath
[17:25:36] <robertmaxrees> that's what I'm doing right now duder.
[17:26:06] <tejas-manohar> so that code actually works?
[17:26:11] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:26:13] <tejas-manohar> yeah
[17:26:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm writing it for you.
[17:26:15] <tejas-manohar> o
[17:26:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to read the docs for .trigger() and .on()
[17:26:35] <robertmaxrees> but i'll do some extra hand-holding real quick.
[17:27:17] <tejas-manohar> alright
[17:28:03] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/avcfgtpy/2/
[17:29:39] <robertmaxrees> read the docs for .trigger() and .on() ;)
[17:30:08] <tejas-manohar> robert: oh so none of this can actually work for me since im using ng-click="submit()"
[17:30:12] <tejas-manohar> right?
[17:30:19] <Utils> I have a canvas which I detect for mousedown (to toggle if the user is drawing) and mousemove (to follow the cursor where they want to go), this works fine for desktops but not so much for touch devices. I believe mousedown works for touch devices although it's sort of ehhh, but mousemove most definitely not. Any ideas how I could support such a thing on mobiles too?
[17:30:47] <Utils> The idea much like with a mouse, place your finger and it does what mousedown does, and drag your finger will do what mousemove does.
[17:30:56] <Utils> then release will be mouseup or whatever
[17:31:10] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar huh?
[17:31:12] <robertmaxrees> oh, noooo.
[17:31:14] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[17:31:23] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: so wont work :(
[17:31:49] <robertmaxrees> don't inline event handlers
[17:32:00] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: is there any alternative for just making html5 required on ios
[17:32:00] <tejas-manohar> lol
[17:32:13] <Utils> vmousedown and vmousemove might actually work
[17:32:16] <Utils> for jquerymobile
[17:32:33] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar did you even try what i gave you?
[17:32:48] <robertmaxrees> alternatively did you consider seeing what angular can do for you in this case?
[17:33:00] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxreees: well its looking for normal submit and ive wired the angular submit() to go to node backend
[17:33:01] <tejas-manohar> ?
[17:33:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:33:30] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: so you think this is still okay?
[17:33:39] <tejas-manohar> even though im using ng-click="submit()"
[17:33:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't know - did you ever try to use it?
[17:34:19] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: about to now
[17:35:32] <damarusama> I use the fadeout for fading out an element, can I use a resizeTo to resize an element to a certain size? it doens't seems to work
[17:36:31] <robertmaxrees> damarusama you need to set the width and height
[17:37:33] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: not working :(
[17:37:34] <damarusama> is this a jquery function though? I can't find it on jquery
[17:37:46] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar do you have to use .ng ?
[17:38:01] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery height
[17:38:05] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .height() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/height/
[17:38:10] <robertmaxrees> damarusama ^
[17:38:15] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: yeah i needa use ng
[17:38:18] <damarusama> thanks - sorry I should have research a bit more
[17:38:48] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar then you need to abstract out the logic i wrote into a function that you cal from there then.
[17:39:23] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: i mean im still calling submit() right?
[17:39:24] <tejas-manohar> ng-click="submit()"
[17:39:32] <tejas-manohar> is there any way to show an alternative for the required field
[17:39:35] <tejas-manohar> for ios
[17:39:42] <tejas-manohar> thats really simple?
[17:39:48] <tejas-manohar> trying to bring something out quick
[17:39:56] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar i don't know anything about angular, so at this point it sounds like you need to go hit up their docs.
[17:40:16] <robertmaxrees> go hit up #angularjs for more help.
[17:41:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll want to ask how to validate a form while there.

[17:45:24] <damarusama> if I use jquery to dynamically change the width of an image, and I want an easing transition should I do the transition in css or let jquery handle the easing?
[17:45:33] <robertmaxrees> damarusama css
[17:45:41] <sammych1> depends on your browser support
[17:45:48] <sammych1> use modernizr
[17:45:56] <robertmaxrees> sure, and let that detect
[17:46:04] <robertmaxrees> sammych1 does that break in a full page?

[17:46:25] <sammych1> wait
[17:46:28] <sammych1> break what?
[17:46:44] <robertmaxrees> sammych1 what do you thing you've found that constitutes a bug?
[17:47:07] <sammych1> ui-focus shouldn't be added to the outside div
[17:47:17] <sammych1> technically, it shouldn't be enhanced by jQM
[17:47:21] <sammych1> afaik
[17:47:32] <robertmaxrees> even though you're setting it to me?
[17:47:34] <robertmaxrees> *be
[17:47:43] <sammych1> it's back to front
[17:47:59] <sammych1> you're telling it that it has been enhanced (by you) and jQM to not touch it anymore
[17:48:27] <Utils> when on mobile, i can drag te whole page around.. is there a specific event or something that i can use to sort of prevent that? i want the "touch drag" to do what i want.
[17:48:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?  that sounds strange to me, sammych1
[17:48:46] <sammych1> delete the attribute and you'll see
[17:49:13] <robertmaxrees> sammych1 it does the same thing for me.
[17:49:36] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to prevent the focus styling?
[17:50:20] <sammych1> this is what it looks like when you leave it default http://jsfiddle.net/17jod2hq/2/
[17:51:05] <robertmaxrees> that's the same as the first one you sent.
[17:51:20] <robertmaxrees> i removed that data attribute and it does the same thing for me.
[17:51:42] <sammych1> huh? the first one has no style, the second one does
[17:51:50] <robertmaxrees> they both look the exact same to me.
[17:52:09] <sammych1> crap
[17:52:20] <robertmaxrees> where did you get this info about data-enhanced?
[17:52:22] <sammych1> http://jsfiddle.net/17jod2hq/3/
[17:53:11] <robertmaxrees> how about we back up and ask the obvious question - what are you actually trying to do?
[17:53:23] <sammych1> get jQM to ignore it
[17:53:36] <robertmaxrees> and not add the extra focus styling?>
[17:54:06] <sammych1> the input is correctly not enhanced, but I suspect that a delegate somewhere is applying the ui-focus class to the parent regardless
[17:55:50] <robertmaxrees> "Any DOM elements inside a data-enhance="false" container, save for data-role="page|dialog" elements, will be ignored during initial enhancement and subsequent create events provided that the $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled flag is set prior to the enhancement (eg in a mobileinit binding)."
[17:57:35] <sammych1> I think they dropped data-enhance (no 'd') somewhere along the way
[17:57:49] <robertmaxrees> that's from http://api.jquerymobile.com/data-attribute/
[17:59:25] <robertmaxrees> might be worth a try
[18:00:45] <sammych1> can't find any documentation on "data-enhanced" though
[18:01:06] <robertmaxrees> neither can I, so why are you using it?
[18:01:25] <sammych1> because the other one doesn't do the job
[18:01:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[18:01:52] <sammych1> http://jsfiddle.net/17jod2hq/4/
[18:01:54] <robertmaxrees> you';re saying "the documented thing doesn't work, so I made up another word"
[18:01:59] <sammych1> still getting enhanced, see?
[18:02:21] <robertmaxrees> read the last bit of the sentence i gave you from the docs.
[18:02:43] <sammych1> it's defaulted to false
[18:02:50] <sammych1> setting it to true has a performance hit
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled = true
[18:03:25] <robertmaxrees> then use data-role="none" instead.
[18:04:41] <sammych1> there we go. We have something that works. Thanks
[18:05:21] <sammych1> I had used that somewhere else before for this. Wonder what relic data-enhanced is that means it still works
[18:19:00] <BillCriswell> I love when I find a perfect walkthrough for something and it's like 80% off.
[18:20:23] <BillCriswell> Well... mostly outdated.
[18:23:42] <wa5ted> BillCriswell: i need some help with a search function
[18:23:51] <wa5ted> essentially i have a data structure
[18:23:56] <wa5ted> with an array of objects
[18:24:05] <wa5ted> i wanna do a search so that as i type
[18:24:29] <wa5ted> the search will cross check my substring vs the values of those that are in the properties of each object
[18:24:35] <wa5ted> how would i go about this
[18:25:32] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: I'd just loop through them and check the properties I need on the input event.
[18:25:46] <mathadder> hi, can someone help me with this relatively easy ajax question?  Im a bit to much of a n00b to really know what's going wrong.  I just get the feeling im doing something really stupid.
[18:26:08] <BillCriswell> mathadder: Just ask, someone should be able to help hopefully!
[18:26:14] <mathadder> basically, i can't figure out why my success snippets aren't making it to my "results" div
[18:26:17] <mathadder> http://pastie.org/private/uhhtg1fnfk3tadozvhlweg
[18:26:24] <funnybunny> wa5ted: $.each(array, function() { if(this.value.indexOf(myNeedle)) { doSomething(); } });
[18:26:51] <wa5ted> funnybunny: true true
[18:27:02] <BillCriswell> mathadder: Is #content the root element of the result?
[18:27:25] <mathadder> BillCriswell: yup, it is
[18:27:59] <BillCriswell> mathadder: You would need to use filter instead of find, of if that's the only element just appending data should do it.
[18:27:59] <mathadder> BillCriswell: it looks something like "<div id="content">Thank you for your submission</div>"
[18:28:29] <mathadder> BillCriswell: ah, let me give that a shot
[18:28:36] <BillCriswell> mathadder: Just $("#result").empty().append(content); should be plenty.
[18:28:56] <funnybunny> BillCriswell: replaceWith() perhaps? :)
[18:29:24] <funnybunny> or html() ?
[18:29:27] <BillCriswell> $('#result').html(content); would be ideal probably.
[18:29:41] <wa5ted> funnybunny: how would i check the search string is a substring across all objects and all properties
[18:29:43] <BillCriswell> funnybunny: Yeah. I wasn't thinking that far ahead. Just trying to get the html haha
[18:29:48] <wa5ted> all properties of thsoe objects
[18:30:02] <mathadder> BillCriswell: ah another great tip, thanks
[18:30:11] <funnybunny> wa5ted: you will need to walk over all object properties also.
[18:30:19] <wa5ted> true true
[18:30:23] <funnybunny> and use a flag that defaults to false
[18:31:12] <mathadder> BillCriswell: Thank you, that worked!
[18:31:12] <wa5ted> funnybunny: 1 last question my search string may contain lowercase
[18:31:15] <BillCriswell> mathadder: If your result html looked like '<div id="content">I just want this</div><div id="bad">and not this</div>'; You would need to use $(content).filter('#content') and not .find('#content') for future reference. Throws a lot of people off.
[18:31:20] <BillCriswell> mathadder: Sweeet.
[18:31:23] <wa5ted> how do i search so that as long as those set of letters
[18:31:28] <wa5ted> exist that is a valid entry
[18:31:35] <wa5ted> entry meaning object
[18:31:43] <wa5ted> example
[18:31:48] <wa5ted> search string: foo
[18:31:52] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: .toLowerCase() all the comparisons
[18:31:58] <wa5ted> true tru
[18:32:12] <funnybunny> wa5ted: now.. you want to do something different :)
[18:32:18] <wa5ted> lol
[18:32:27] <funnybunny> wa5ted: prepare a "searchable" array.
[18:32:42] <funnybunny> in which you have objects with only 2 properties.
[18:32:42] <wa5ted> true true
[18:33:00] <funnybunny> one property will be the index of the object in the actual results array.
[18:33:31] <funnybunny> the other property will be a string that contains all properties of the individual objects in the search array
[18:33:36] <funnybunny> lowercased ofc
[18:33:42] <funnybunny> you just append them to that one string..
[18:34:05] <funnybunny> if you find an indexOf() you just return the object from the original array, of which you know the index
[18:34:13] <wa5ted> found it
[18:34:18] <wa5ted> thanks for the help :)
[18:34:22] <wa5ted> got it i mean
[18:34:23] <funnybunny> de nada, senor
[18:35:26] <funnybunny> feel free to send beer, i mean ;)
[18:37:10] <wa5ted> lol
[18:37:15] <wa5ted> got a create an app forthat
[18:37:23] <wa5ted> buy me a beer
[18:37:25] <wa5ted> lol
[18:37:35] <funnybunny> well, they call it paypal
[18:37:55] <BillCriswell> There was a service for that... I forget what it was called, though.
[18:40:08] <BillCriswell> I hate admin stuff.
[18:42:24] <wa5ted> funnybunny: hmmmm
[18:42:27] <wa5ted> seems the index of
[18:42:30] <wa5ted> isnt working for me
[18:42:37] <wa5ted> returnign all the messages
[18:42:39] <wa5ted> in the return array
[18:42:43] <BillCriswell> wa5ted: Make sure you're testing > -1.
[18:43:01] <wa5ted> oh right
[18:43:04] <wa5ted> forgot that part :)
[18:43:10] <wa5ted> XD
[18:43:13] <wa5ted> im feeling stupid
[18:43:15] <funnybunny> wa5ted: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[18:44:03] <wa5ted> yeah! :D
[20:06:28] <sammych1> is there different behaviour for opening mailto: (and regular href) when using window.location.href on desktop vs mobile devices?
[20:07:57] <sammych1> on desktop, the links would follow correctly. On touch and touch/mouse devices, they don't follow in Chrome
[20:29:36] <floatmastaflex> hey, how do I get the OBJECT containing the data returned by an ajax request via .ajaxComplete?
[21:11:42] <zogdog> Was hoping I could get some assistance with jquery / put / mongo / form updates
[21:12:50] <zogdog> Sorry, new to IRC, is there a certain way to ask questions that will provide better responses or interaction?
[21:13:46] <Jattenalle> zogdog, ask your actual question, dont ask to ask
[21:14:07] <Jattenalle> it helps if you can post a jsfiddle with the code you're having issues with
[21:14:19] <zogdog> Thank you Jattenalle, let me do that real quick
[21:16:57] <zogdog> hmm, well my code isn't really something compilable with jsfiddle, but I'll post what I have any my question.
[21:17:55] <zogdog> So I am trying to turn my submit button on a form in EJS to type 'PUT' and this is what I have for the put section in my routes section
[21:17:56] <zogdog> http://jsfiddle.net/nf7Lmyjq/
[21:18:50] <zogdog> I just don't understand how to have jquery .put or update.  I've read about $.ajax and then there are options within, but I'm not entirely confident in my understanding of those options.
[21:20:04] <zogdog> for example, I see on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ if you search for "put" and under type, you can define it as such, but I don't understand how I'm supposed to fill out the rest of the kv to make it work
[21:24:02] <systemfault> zogdog: What is “the rest”?
[21:24:32] <systemfault> If you set the type as “PUT” then it will be… For the request body, it depends on what you server expects.
[21:24:36] <zogdog> the rest?  Where is the rest of the code or what is the rest, as in restful...?
[21:25:04] <systemfault> “the rest of the kv” (I guess that KV means key/value)
[21:26:26] <zogdog> yes on kv, well... I guess let me put html code in there as well, one moment
[21:28:46] <zogdog> @systemfault I updated the jsfiddle file, not sure if that's what you're looking for, but please keep asking, I'll provide all I can
[21:29:05] <zogdog> http://jsfiddle.net/nf7Lmyjq/2/
[21:29:33] <systemfault> Wait
[21:29:44] <systemfault> You’re giving me node code on a jquery channel? :P
[21:30:23] <systemfault> Ok, where is the problem now? You said it was ajax related
[21:31:13] <systemfault> You probably want “return res.send(err);” on line 4 of that paste.. so the rest of the function isn’t executed on error
[21:31:25] <systemfault> Same thing on line 25
[21:31:38] <systemfault> But that doesn’t tell me what the actual problem is
[21:32:49] <zogdog> thanks for that, sorry my actual question with jquery is trying to find a decent tutorial on how I integrate the options of $.ajax({ url, settings, options, callback })
[21:34:03] <zogdog> I don't understand enough from api.jquery to grasp it, I need to make a button call 'put' on a web service (i.e. /example/:product_id
[21:34:33] <systemfault> Ah
[21:35:39] <systemfault> Give me 2 minutes
[21:36:12] <zogdog> okay, BUT I also need to understand how when you call 'put' on a webservice, you pass in the data from the input fields that were modified.
[21:37:07] <systemfault> zogdog: http://jsfiddle.net/nf7Lmyjq/3/
[21:37:51] <systemfault> zogdog: Depends on how RESTful is the webservice...
[21:38:09] <systemfault> In theory, PUT should send the full resource.
[21:39:41] <zogdog> okay wait, so data: $(this).serialize() represents all of the input fields in the form?
[21:40:16] <systemfault> Yeah
[21:40:29] <systemfault> The key being the “name” and the value… well, “value"
[21:41:45] <zogdog> okay, next question, which it sounds like you may know, in my node code, is that set up correctly to apply to my mongo document?
[21:42:46] <zogdog> From what I understand, the Product.findById grabs what I give it, which is the id from req.params.product_id then I create the variable called product to use as my db reference
[21:43:25] <systemfault> Looks “fine” but it’s been a while since the last time I’ve used Mongoose but the “logic” looks good
[21:43:39] <systemfault> (beside the two “returns” I mentioned earlier)
[21:44:27] <zogdog> okay, let me try that a bit and see how I do.  Since I'm new to IRC, is there a way I can communicate with you further if I have questions?  I have to leave campus and hit the train soon
[21:45:12] <systemfault> zogdog: I can give you my email.. but I’m often here…
[21:45:39] <zogdog> sorry, how do you send a message to you directly like you did to me?
[21:45:45] <zogdog> systemfault: test test
[21:45:49] <zogdog> lol nope
[21:45:57] <systemfault> You do /msg <nickname> message
[21:46:01] <systemfault> What is your client?
[21:46:08] <zogdog> HexChat
[21:53:31] <wa5ted> shold be able to double click user name
[21:53:36] <wa5ted> in chatzilla i can
[21:53:42] <wa5ted> in the uerlist
[21:53:45] <wa5ted> userlist
[21:53:48] <wa5ted> zogdog: ^
[23:11:02] <slax0r> morning
[23:18:00] <wa5ted> morning
[23:18:03] <wa5ted> and good night
[23:18:05] <wa5ted> both
[23:20:17] <mz_> I have a question about JQuery UI 1.11: I noticed that after updating to it, Selenium tests that use actions.dragAndDrop (or clickAndHold followed by move) no longer work -- does anyone know what changes since 1.10.4 might have caused this?
[23:20:49] <slavka`> hey guys... if i got a string... [{"name":"Alejandro Pérez","date":"8-2014"},{"name":"Ruben Matturano","date":"8-2014"}] and im trying to $.parseJSON ... it fails b/c of the special character.... é  , just wondering if theres a way i can parse that string into JSON ?
