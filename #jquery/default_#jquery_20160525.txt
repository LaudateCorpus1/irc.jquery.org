[04:03:08] <g33kyboi> Hi
[04:04:35] <g33kyboi> Please can someone help with an explanation on why $(element).animate({scrollLeft: 300}); works only once
[04:05:51] <Cork> it shouldn't
[04:07:11] <Bheam> yo
[04:07:36] <Bheam> is it possible to rewrite this to support ajax loaded content? $('.menu .menu_expand').closest('LI').on('click', function()
[04:08:55] <Bheam> like $('BODY').on('click', '.menu .menu_expand < LI', ... :p
[04:09:28] <g33kyboi> Cork: apparently, it does
[04:10:19] <Cork> g33kyboi: https://jsfiddle.net/mpy992gq/1/
[04:11:50] <Cork> Bheam: sure $('.menu').on('click', '.menu_expand li', function() {})
[04:11:57] <Cork> if .menu is static that is
[04:23:23] <g33kyboi> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/bycra4q8/
[04:24:02] <Cork> g33kyboi: scrollLeft: 300 means "scroll to position 300"
[04:24:09] <Cork> so if you already are on position 300 it won't move
[04:24:48] <Cork> that's the difference between scrollLeft: 300 and scrollLeft: '+=300'
[04:25:03] <g33kyboi> Okay, thanks
[05:09:34] <Xatenev> Heya
[05:10:01] <Xatenev> I use the scroll event and if ($(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() >= $(document).height() - 300) { } - the problem: this if triggers around 10 times
[05:11:01] <Xatenev> How would I go on to set a flag so it only triggers once?
[05:11:07] <Xatenev> https://jsfiddle.net/5hx50xsa/
[05:11:29] <Xatenev> https://jsfiddle.net/5hx50xsa/1/
[05:12:05] <cannap> not working
[05:14:46] <Xatenev> cannap: it doesnt matter but if you feel better: https://jsfiddle.net/5hx50xsa/2/
[05:14:46] <Xatenev> :p
[05:15:13] <cannap> you never call the function?
[05:15:19] <JavaLover> if you have <form action = "/somepath">   does it just go based on where the current url is?
[05:15:23] <Xatenev> cannap: are you kidding me?
[05:15:35] <JavaLover> like on submit how does it interpet that?
[05:15:41] <cannap> hmm no i cant see
[05:15:43] <Xatenev> cannap: Or you just dont understand what im asking xD
[05:15:44] <cannap> where you call the function
[05:15:49] <Xatenev> cannap: I got a logic problem inside the function
[05:15:56] <Xatenev> cannap: Im not recreating my whole application in that fiddle.
[05:15:59] <cannap> ah :P
[05:16:16] <Xatenev> Where would I go on to set some kind of flag so that if doesnt triggers too often.
[05:16:26] <cannap> find a logic problem in js without seeing how it works :P
[05:16:53] <Xatenev> you can read in the fiddle how it works lkol
[05:16:53] <Xatenev> lol
[05:16:58] <Xatenev> The if is triggered 11 times.
[05:17:01] <Xatenev> because of browser weirdoness.
[05:17:05] <cannap> yea sure
[05:17:08] <Xatenev> and thats it
[05:17:18] <Xatenev> you can remove all the content in if() {} cause it doesnt matter.
[05:18:07] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/5hx50xsa/3/
[05:18:11] <cannap> something like that?
[05:18:33] <cannap> au no wait
[05:18:47] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/5hx50xsa/4/
[05:19:13] <cannap> or unbind the function
[05:19:19] <cannap> also the event
[05:31:21] <nardev> guys is there any alternative to .live() in 1.9? other than .on)=
[05:31:35] <nardev> i want to attach some event to an element which is still not added to the page
[05:31:46] <cannap> also i can do this with .on
[05:32:12] <decx> you do it with on because that's what on does
[05:32:23] <nardev> hmm..
[05:32:52] <nardev> $('.element').on(something,dunction(){});
[05:33:09] <nardev> it will add event to an .element although it doesn't exist on the page?
[05:33:31] <decx> that's not how it works
[05:33:36] <nardev> ou..
[05:33:51] <decx> $('element') will collect all elements that match that description and on will assign an eventhandler
[05:34:06] <nardev> decx, fine
[05:34:17] <decx> if you look for element when there are no elements on the page you assign eventhandlers to an empty object
[05:34:18] <nardev> in my case i want to add some actions to an .element
[05:34:27] <nardev> although it's not there yet
[05:34:35] <decx> instead you take a static element that exists and delegate from there
[05:34:40] <nardev> decx, help ... how?
[05:34:52] <decx> $('#my-container').on(event, '.element', fn)
[05:35:17] <decx> no you asssign 1 eventhandler to #my-container which listens to bubbling events from the element
[05:35:34] <decx> now you*
[05:35:55] <nardev> decx, so i can assign that on a body
[05:35:55] <nardev> ?
[05:36:41] <decx> any element that exists and is a parent of where you add your new elements
[05:37:18] <cannap> @nardev, https://jsfiddle.net/asqqeo2t/

[07:42:54] <lalalaaa> What was the jquery mobile dev channel?

[07:45:30] <lalalaaa> good to see you again cork
[07:50:13] <lalalaaa> I'm using embedly-jquery embed YouTube URLs: https://jsfiddle.net/lalala1234/bLhsg4qe/
[07:50:16] <lalalaaa> But every time thet user reloads, embedly-jquery has to re-fetch the YouTube thumbnails and all that stuff, which is unnecessary and actually costs a lot of money (Embedly is not free).
[07:50:20] <lalalaaa> So instead, how to best cache these YouTube embeds?
[07:50:47] <decx> use the youtube api directly then
[07:53:47] <lalalaaa> decx: I have to use embedly because there's soundcloud, vimeo, vine etc. as well
[07:54:15] <lalalaaa> It's just if I can cache these responses maybe I don't have to drain my wallet every payday =)
[07:54:37] <decx> probably how they make money
[07:56:59] <lalalaaa> im fine paying for their embeds its just that when users navigate through the site and return, stuff has to load all over again which is unnecessary for the user as well
[08:03:29] <baako> hi guys i have an issue. i am trying to hide a div before jquery ui have finish doing his thing http://kopy.io/AH5D4 (snippet) of my code. The issue i am having is that the div gets hidden before jquery ui accordion have finish manipulation the html element using the response from $.post. My question is, is they a way to (1) know that $.post have got a response (2) is they a way to know when jquery ui accordion have finish doing his thing? i hope that
[08:03:29] <baako> make sense
[08:09:21] <helloNL> Hey could anyone explain why $('body, html').animate({ scrollTop: $clone.offset().top }, 1000); doesnt scroll to the right object?
[08:16:42] <hassan> hello
[08:16:53] <hassan> i new in jquery
[08:17:10] <hassan> help me for select correct path
[08:17:27] <hassan> i want to be a web designer
[08:18:06] <hassan> i the future i want to create a mobile app.
[08:18:16] <hassan> can jquery help to me?
[08:19:28] <Cork> hassan: i would recommend to start with reading through http://learn.jquery.com
[08:20:25] <Cork> helloNL: if $clone is what it sounds it is, it means it isn't in the document
[08:20:30] <Cork> so it doesn't have an offset
[08:20:40] <helloNL> It is
[08:21:20] <helloNL> But the problem is that I have 2 buttons that clone a hidden template and edit it. At the end I call that line
[08:21:32] <helloNL> At first when you press only 1 of the buttons it works like expected
[08:21:52] <helloNL> But when I do phone number and then addresses it just goes to the wrong offset
[08:22:04] <helloNL> It really is weird :/
[08:22:24] <helloNL> I am not sure how I can show it as I dont have it in html only :/
[08:32:42] <helloNL> I got it already I think, animate makes the offset go to the top of the screen, doesnt it?

[08:40:22] <Prabhat> How can i prepend 0 to input type =number for 0-9? ie. i want number 01-09 when i select number
[08:41:00] <helloNL> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6466135/adding-extra-zeros-in-front-of-a-number-using-jquery
[08:41:29] <Kingsy> how can I call a function within the same object when I am within a .each() ? this references the loop not the object...
[08:41:51] <taplar> store the this in a variable and use it inside the each
[08:42:05] <Kingsy> ah rigth.. heh so simple.
[08:42:52] <taplar> Prabhat: or take a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8437529/html5-input-type-number-removes-leading-zero
[08:43:31] <helloNL> $('body, html').animate({ scrollTop: $clone.offset().top - $('body').height() }, 1000); is this not allowed?
[08:43:39] <helloNL> I am not really getting an error in the console
[08:43:48] <taplar> helloNL: have a fiddle with your issue?
[08:43:54] <helloNL> Nop
[08:44:06] <helloNL> Its blade.php
[08:44:15] <taplar> would help us see the issue your running in to
[08:44:38] <helloNL> Yh I understand, I just can't show you unless you want to do it by teamviewer
[08:44:58] <taplar> uh, you should be able to make a fiddle to show it
[08:45:50] <helloNL> It are a lot of scripts and files :/
[08:45:57] <taplar> i'm not aware of a 'scrollTop' css argument though
[08:46:19] <baako> is they a way in jquery to check if a div have finish rendering?
[08:46:24] <helloNL> In addition to style properties, some non-style properties such as scrollTop and scrollLeft, as well as custom properties, can be animated.
[08:46:40] <taplar> where'd you get that?
[08:47:11] <helloNL> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[08:47:21] <helloNL> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6633485/jquery-scroll-to-newly-appended-element
[08:47:31] <taplar> interesting
[08:47:41] <helloNL> I am trying to scroll to a new element, but I have 2 buttons that create new elements
[08:48:09] <helloNL> I have the first button which adds some fields for a phone number, the other underneath it adds fields for addresses
[08:48:31] <helloNL> But when I press phone number and then address and then phone number it scrolls not like I want it too
[08:48:45] <helloNL> Now I thought it might be because it wants to go to the top of the page
[08:49:06] <helloNL> So I am trying to add the half of my window
[08:49:29] <helloNL> subtract*
[08:50:10] <Kingsy> can someone see the problem with this --> http://hastebin.com/uluzatorab.coffee <_- it just crashes the browser at the moment.. all I want to do is force the loop execution to wait until the ajax response comes back
[08:51:28] <helloNL> Dont do that with a loop
[08:51:32] <helloNL> It will never come out of that loop
[08:51:34] <taplar> you should really try to use the callbacks rather than try to figure out a way to wait until it finishes
[08:51:49] <taplar> your fighting the paradigm dude, :P
[08:52:34] <helloNL> $('body, html').animate({ scrollTop: $clone.offset().top - ($('body').height() / 2) }, 1000); taplar do you perhaps know something to make it scroll to the half of my screen?
[08:52:40] <helloNL> This isnt working :/
[08:53:05] <helloNL> At the start it does what I want
[08:53:18] <helloNL> Then it start going above the half until it doesnt show on screen anymore
[08:53:22] <Kingsy> taplar: I cant think of a way of doing that with callbacks
[08:54:39] <helloNL> You could trigger a custom event to know that it has happened
[08:54:53] <alaing> When I try access my app at root level (localhost:3000) it throws this error Routing Error - uninitialized constant SessionsController https://gist.github.com/aliuk2012/7a3a92ff4283665e863b02e2fbd436d8
[08:54:53] <helloNL> That way you dont have to worry for if the data is there
[08:55:44] <alaing> What I want to do is lock down the whole app and the landing page is the signin page if the user is not logged in else it should take them to the user home page
[09:02:39] <taplar> helloNL: https://jsfiddle.net/zp9fg5fe/
[09:02:44] <taplar> crap he left
[09:03:58] <taplar> Kingsy: you'd just use the success, failure, or always callbacks
[09:05:06] <Kingsy> I cant, I am using a really weird ajac library.. so all I can do is "call" I don't have an option.. I can get a callback to run.. but I am iterating through a .each()
[09:05:26] <taplar> what library?
[09:05:27] <Kingsy> taplar: so I need to stop the .each() moving onto the next iteration
[09:06:06] <Kingsy> well put it this way, I am not sure how I would solve this problem using callbacks regardless
[09:06:45] <taplar> that was weird.  my ff just died, :s
[09:06:57] <Kingsy> taplar: well put it this way, I am not sure how I would solve this problem using callbacks regardless, how would I go about that?
[09:07:08] <Kingsy> I need to stop the .each() moving onto the next interation
[09:07:37] <taplar> instead of a literal loop you'd have a logical loop
[09:07:46] <taplar> say you have an array of things you need to ajax load
[09:07:52] <Kingsy> taplar: can you show me an example?
[09:08:01] <taplar> one sec
[09:08:14] <Kingsy> thanks! :D
[09:12:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Ljpgs8c9/
[09:12:18] <taplar> or some flavor of that
[09:13:11] <Kingsy> oh ok I think I see.
[09:13:40] <Kingsy> I am working with jquery objects tho in this case... elements.
[09:14:04] <Kingsy> taplar: did you see my example?
[09:14:21] <taplar> yep, so the question is how do those elements relate to the ajax call you will make?
[09:15:02] <taplar> and you can always break out of the jquery object into an array with .get()
[09:15:39] <Kingsy> I pass them to the call via the query string.
[09:16:00] <Kingsy> ok I think I see.
[09:18:19] <taplar> the point here is ajax options like success/error/complete, or the deferred/promise methods of done/then/always and such, are fired when the ajax finishes.  since your doing async processing you want to think in this paradigm.  normal procedural loops don't fit this paradigm
[09:19:46] <taplar> instead of fixing a problem of your making, don't make the problem in the first place, :)
[09:20:06] <Kingsy> hehe its just a confusing concept to me at the moment.
[09:20:18] <taplar> oh sure, first time takes a bit
[09:33:21] <Julie1> Hi ! I have an issue with jquery Autocomplete with draggable item. Before trying to make a fiddle, I'd just like to know if any of you has an idea : When I drag an item from my autocomplete input, my mouse stays at the same place (hover the item of the autocomplete) but the new item (which is a copy (helper : clone)) is at the top left of my screen, which means the item is hard to move as the mouse is half a screen away fro
[09:35:38] <baako> is they a way in jquery to check if a div have finish rendering?
[09:35:51] <taplar> what do you mean finished rendering?
[09:36:44] <fiord> like, check if the browser has drawn it?
[09:37:24] <Kingsy> taplar: can I use pop on an array like this.. var hello["blah"] = [["1"],["2"]]; hello["blah2"] = [["1"],["2"]]   var temp = hello.pop() should give me blah2 and leave hello only left with blah1 right?
[09:38:10] <taplar> try it and see, but i think that's an object, not an array
[09:38:31] <taplar> var hello["blah"] = [["1"],["2"]]; doesn't even look valid
[09:39:26] <taplar> but yes, pop() removes the last element from an array
[09:39:50] <noob123> Hey all have  question with the Datepicker API. I am trying to accomplish a restriction of max 65 days between start_date and end_date in the api. (date ranges)  My way of doing this is setting the [defaultDate: "#start_date"]. However this does not work.  Any suggestions?
[09:40:17] <taplar> you could do it a couple ways (at least)
[09:40:21] <Kingsy> I can probably get away with a normal array tbh
[09:40:37] <taplar> one way would be to not let them choose a end date until they choose a start date
[09:40:57] <taplar> then when they do, calculate the start date + 65 days and set that as the max date on the end_date datepicker
[09:41:16] <taplar> or, just logically check when the two things change to see if they exceed 65 days, and if so, error
[09:41:35] <realies> any ideas of a library for autogenerating nested tables from json?
[09:41:44] <Kingsy> taplar: all I want is a simple 2d array.
[09:41:51] <taplar> realies: handlebarjs?
[09:42:20] <taplar> var hello = [[1, 2], [1, 2]];
[09:42:28] <realies> taplar, does it generate all just based on json?
[09:42:44] <Kingsy> taplar: but how would you construct that in a loop?
[09:42:45] <taplar> you have to define your templates how they should look
[09:42:53] <Kingsy> i.e push a new array each time.
[09:43:09] <taplar> Kingsy: i'd need a more concrete example of what your trying to do, :)
[09:45:13] <Kingsy> taplar: http://hastebin.com/rejegehomu.coffee <--
[09:45:35] <Kingsy> something like that.. I just want a regular 2d array out so I can use pop on it
[09:45:56] <taplar> more concrete.  your finding 'p' elements and looping over them to do something.  why?  what off of the p do you need for your ajax?
[09:46:30] <Kingsy> I need to ajax the text() from the span elements within the p
[09:46:36] <Kingsy> in a query string
[09:46:42] <taplar> so make that paste reflect that
[09:46:49] <taplar> pls, :)
[09:48:47] <taplar> btw, i was wondering this before, but what is "$j" ?  is that jQuery in another variable?
[09:49:24] <Kingsy> its jquery sorry
[09:49:26] <Kingsy> http://hastebin.com/bayotuwacu.coffee <--
[09:49:42] <taplar> alright so lets see
[09:51:11] <taplar> how is 'obj.someVariable[type]' used for the ajax call?
[09:51:24] <Kingsy> ah I think I have it
[09:53:46] <Kingsy> give me a few mins
[09:53:51] <Kingsy> taplar: thanks for your help btw :D
[09:54:00] <taplar> sure
[10:14:02] <Julie2> https://jsfiddle.net/a38wj3sw/1/ : When I try to drag something from the last input, the item is at the top left corner instead of under my mouse. Do you know why is that ? (and how could I fix it ?)
[10:19:39] <Xatenev> right now im using fadeOut to make an element disappear in a cool way :p
[10:19:46] <Xatenev> how would I go on to make it dash out of the screen to the left?
[10:20:33] <decx> like this https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/

[10:31:58] <taplar_meeting> the shake is interesting for like buttons that you want to draw attention to
[10:33:42] <Guest99104> Hello everyone, are there any links to rules that need to be followed to get help around here ? Dont want to start wrong :)
[10:34:06] <taplar> irc.jquery.org has some guidelines
[10:34:28] <taplar> but pretty much just be nice, be descriptive, and give code snipplets when possible
[10:34:49] <realies> taplar, handlebarjs seems so cool, any ideas on modifying single field data live? trying to do a scoreboard and results would be updated live...
[10:35:09] <taplar> you mean your doing like websockets?
[10:35:25] <realies> not that advanced
[10:36:00] <realies> im imagining that the json structure would change, but redrawing the whole table would be unnecessary
[10:36:03] <realies> I think
[10:36:17] <taplar> sure, at that point once you have the table you could just select the field to update and change it
[10:37:36] <realies> taplar, that means that I have to have dynamically generated classes/ids?
[10:37:48] <realies> for each <td>
[10:37:57] <taplar> to make your life easier, yup
[10:37:59] <realies> or whatever holds the data obviously
[10:38:18] <realies> hm, I wonder what would be the most clever way of doing something like this
[10:38:36] <taplar> how many of these tables are there?
[10:38:41] <realies> Right now I'm exporting json from a data entry app which is then consumed by the html template
[10:38:59] <Guest99104> Well.. I'm new with jQuery, still messing around at CodeAcademy. I'm slowly creating a small site and I have 50 images on it from which i want the user to select between 1 and 5 and that would create a other action. Now the other action is not important for me now, as for now I'm just looking on how to restrict the user from selecting more then 5 images from the site. Are there any places I can read about it?
[10:39:22] <taplar> how are they selecting images?
[10:39:49] <Guest99104> by clicking on them I wanted to use the .selectable interaction from jquery ui
[10:39:50] <taplar> and you can take a couple approaches to that
[10:40:17] <taplar> first you could check on what ever action they are doing to select an image, to see how many they've selected
[10:40:23] <taplar> if more than 5, error
[10:40:24] <realies> taplar, like 20ish tables with 10ish rows each
[10:40:38] <taplar> otherwise you could just check when they try to click your next action and let them know, hey, you can't only do 5
[10:40:41] <realies> and maybe 5-10 cols
[10:40:48] <realies> seems like a lot of data
[10:40:58] <taplar> realies: what's the distinction between tables?  teams?
[10:41:08] <realies> taplar, horse racing
[10:41:17] <Guest99104> Ok then taplar. :) ill go that direction and read about it :) thank you
[10:41:21] <taplar> so each table is a particular race?
[10:41:40] <realies> meets > races > horse&jockey and some result data
[10:42:05] <taplar> ok, so you kinda already have logical groupings that could be reflected some how on the tables in their attributes
[10:42:21] <realies> I got the db structure and all
[10:43:02] <taplar> so it's just a matter of putting attributes on them that let you know when you get updates which place(s) to update
[10:43:13] <realies> hm
[10:44:00] <realies> sounds like meet_id_12 > race_id_8 > horse_id_8_result
[10:44:07] <Xatenev> Wow webkit fill mode on animate.css destroys everything =/
[10:44:12] <taplar> i'd go with classes and data elements
[10:44:25] <Xatenev> @decx:
[10:44:31] <taplar> class="meet" data-id="whatever"
[10:44:51] <taplar> don't overload classes or ids with logic, :)
[10:45:07] <realies> agreed, data seems a lot more elegant
[10:46:43] <Kingsy> taplar: I managed to get it working!
[10:46:49] <taplar> sweet
[10:47:24] <Kingsy> thankyou for your help.. this has been great for me thinking about things on an async level rather than a normal logical flow
[10:47:36] <Kingsy> greate practice.
[10:47:39] <Kingsy> great*
[10:54:32] <Julie2> Sorry, I am trying again : https://jsfiddle.net/a38wj3sw/1/ : When I try to drag something from the last input, the item is at the top left corner instead of under my mouse. Do you know why is that ? (and how could I fix it ?)
[10:56:12] <taplar> i'm confused, why would you drag one of those autocompletes?
[11:03:08] <taplar> but whatevs, https://jsfiddle.net/a38wj3sw/2/ <-- Julie2
[11:03:41] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-cursorAt
[11:03:43] <Julie2> taplar: I am dragging them because the user needs to be able to select an item and put it in a "group"
[11:04:10] <Julie2> Thanks for the fix !
[11:04:13] <Julie2> I really suck at debugging jquery...
[11:04:28] <taplar> so your using it more like a searchable
[11:04:28] <Julie2> In my previous version of my website, it was working fine my way
[11:04:38] <Julie2> I guess
[11:04:48] <taplar> that's what was throwing me off, :)
[11:05:00] <Julie2> (I am not really a "UI person" so I may be doing a mess :D )
[11:05:25] <taplar> well are you going to be dragging it to one of those other inputs?
[11:06:19] <taplar> (goal wise)
[11:06:23] <AdamPDotty> where does the ul come from?
[11:07:14] <Julie2> I am not really sure of the question, but I am dropping it in a group (which is a div or an ul, I don't really remember how I did it), and there are many groups, we can add some, etc...
[11:07:30] <taplar> ah, ok
[11:07:49] <Julie2> It is basically to create an AND/OR condition, like : (MyAutocompleteItem OR anotherItem) AND (item OR item OR item)
[11:08:01] <taplar> your other 5 input boxes in that fiddle made me think you were going to try to put the draggable in them
[11:08:06] <Julie2> so we select the item and drag and drop them to the needed group
[11:08:55] <Julie2> taplar: actually, there are here only to make my autocomplete lower in the page so the probleme would be more visible (but I maybe should have use something else, it's confusing :D )
[11:09:08] <AdamPDotty> .attr("data-value" -> .data("value"
[11:09:10] <taplar> css, margin-top
[11:09:12] <taplar> :P
[11:09:25] <taplar> ^ and that too
[11:09:34] <AdamPDotty> and rather CSS than <br />
[11:10:57] <Julie2> I do things better usually, but I was only focusing on my problem for the fiddle :)
[11:11:11] <Julie2> and in the end, I still had to use a margin :D
[11:11:23] <Julie2> well a padding actually
[11:11:40] <AdamPDotty> just here to suggest things
[11:14:04] <Julie2> then thanks :)
[11:14:34] <taplar> adam is here to suggest things.  i'm here to make other look better by comparison
[11:14:52] <Julie2> :D
[11:15:00] <taplar> it's a curse, really
[11:16:29] <Julie2> Well, I just tried to add the modification with the cursorAt in my script, and it won't work :D
[11:16:37] <Julie2> at least I have a base for debugging :)
[11:21:29] <Julie2> well, I said nothing, it works fine with "cursor" instead of "cursur" :d
[11:21:52] <Julie2> thank you so much for solving this !
[11:40:36] <wspider> Hello, I am trying to dispaly a form with a checkbox and a label and .ui-helper-hidden-accessible makes invisible the checkbox
[11:41:04] <wspider> I tried adding a for to the label pointing to the input id, I also tried to put the input inside the label with no success
[11:42:03] <JZA> hi I got a Jquery function to pass from csv to html table, and I want to apply another jquery function so that table get some filtering properties
[11:42:25] <JZA> the issue is that putting the code straight up fails since there is no table on the DOM to begin with
[11:42:40] <JZA> so I wonder how can I add the function to the appended element
[11:42:43] <JZA> here is the code
[11:43:44] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/08BTGEM
[11:43:52] <wspider> what does jquery ui has against forms with checkboxes
[11:44:02] <JZA> so the table gets appended on like 21
[11:44:05] <JZA> err 31
[11:45:28] <JZA> what I want is to add the filterTable() method
[11:45:38] <JZA> from line 48
[11:48:54] <mdunham__> Hello peeps <3 y'all
[11:52:35] <JZA> anyone?
[11:52:39] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/08BTGEM
[11:52:46] <JZA> so I wonder how can I add the function to the appended element
[11:54:56] <d2k> hello I would like to receive some help if you guys can help. I would like to reset a div to it's initial state after another div has been clicked. Is there a simple way to do this?
[11:58:30] <AdamPDotty> remove the class you added before
[11:58:35] <d2k> can I post a snippet so you might take a close look at it?
[11:59:41] <simonsaysdiaf> don't ask to ask, just ask
[11:59:51] <d2k> I am not using a added class instead I would like to reset a div that has been clicked when triggering another div
[11:59:58] <d2k> my code is as follows:
[12:00:10] <d2k> var originalState = $(".maincontent-leftcol-listing").clone(); 		window.onload=function(){ 				var jqnc = jQuery.noConflict();  				jqnc(".maincontent-leftcol-listing").append('<div class="swipe-indicator"></div>');	 				jqnc(".maincontent-leftcol-listing").append('<div class="swipe-fond"></div>');	 				jqnc('.leftcol-blue-headline').css('display', 'none'); 				jqnc('.multiple-tabs').css('display', 'none');	 				jqnc('.swipe-fond').css
[12:00:22] <simonsaysdiaf> d2k: do not paste directly in the channel ever
[12:00:25] <taplar> please create a jsfiddle or jsbin and don't paste in the channel
[12:00:28] <simonsaysdiaf> use a pastie or jsfiddle
[12:00:37] <d2k> ok, sorry
[12:00:42] <simonsaysdiaf> 0bin.net and fpaste.org are great ones
[12:00:43] <AdamPDotty> man topic
[12:00:51] <taplar> JZA: your script tags outside of <head> and <body> should really be a child of one of those two
[12:00:55] <simonsaysdiaf> AdamPDotty: lol as if anyone reads the topic ;)
[12:01:09] <taplar> i do, :P
[12:01:56] <d2k> here ist the snippet: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/370764/19209614/
[12:01:57] <simonsaysdiaf> :P
[12:03:12] <taplar> d2k: where is this logic located?
[12:03:57] <d2k> taplar: it is part of a mobile detect call only for android smartphones
[12:04:09] <taplar> no, i mean, in the head or the body?
[12:04:25] <d2k> in the head
[12:04:29] <AdamPDotty> You can actually put style in a CSS file
[12:04:33] <taplar> ok, then line 1 will not work
[12:04:38] <taplar> if you don't have this in a doc ready
[12:04:46] <taplar> the body doesn't exist in the dom yet for you to select things
[12:04:50] <d2k> I see
[12:05:00] <d2k> I'm gonna try a document.ready()
[12:05:04] <d2k> brb
[12:05:50] <taplar> also if your going to do a doc ready you may as well pass in $ so you can use that
[12:05:51] * AdamPDotty bets on document.ready(function(){window.onload = function(){};});
[12:06:38] <taplar> jQuery(function($){ /* I can use $ in here for jQuery */ }); jQuery.noConflict();
[12:07:23] <taplar> or better yet, put your script at the bottom of your body, :P
[12:07:31] <d2k> would you mind viewing the real thing, I can give you the url (needs to be openend with chrome smartphone viw)
[12:07:52] <taplar> i'm going to lunch soon, but there are others here too, :)
[12:07:59] <d2k> https://www.bebe.com.py/desa/index.php?route=product/category&path=59
[12:09:00] <JZA> taplar: right, I moved it now but I am not sure thats the issue :)
[12:09:01] <d2k> opening this link with chrome smartphone dev tool will show a mobile version, theres a blue box on the left side, when this box is clicked it's all "fine" but when I click the "close" button the bluebox div wont reset
[12:09:14] <taplar> JZA: it's just more correct, ;)
[12:09:56] <d2k> I'm searching for a way to reset the entire div to it's initial state
[12:10:32] <d2k> something like "turn focus off"
[12:11:23] <AdamPDotty> <AdamPDotty> remove the class you added before
[12:11:40] <taplar> btw your doing noConflict repeatedly in this page...
[12:12:37] <taplar> you realize once you do noConflict, any logic past that that tries to use $ as jQuery is going to error, right?
[12:13:09] <AdamPDotty> welll
[12:13:36] <taplar> i guess he's doing it inside doc readies, so it wouldn't affect the initial load...
[12:13:39] <taplar> :s
[12:13:51] <taplar> that's a smell though, imo
[12:14:23] <d2k> I'm so thankfull somebody is trying to help me with that, really thanks a bunch, I hope I explain things right
[12:14:33] <taplar> i don't see clone on this page
[12:14:47] <d2k> the close seems not to work
[12:15:09] <d2k> the var for the close is outside the click bind which results in trouble
[12:15:39] <JZA> taplar: thanks I fixed it any advice on having the method on the newly added table
[12:15:57] <taplar> let me find your link again
[12:16:02] <taplar> or can you share an updated link?
[12:16:38] <JZA> I isolate the js
[12:16:50] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/0XND9AE
[12:17:17] <taplar> k, where/when are you binding on the table(s)?
[12:17:23] <JZA> like 7
[12:18:01] <JZA> I add a table tag on line 5, and now I need to apply a filterTable() to it, and insert the selector
[12:18:23] <taplar> i don't know much about d3
[12:18:34] <taplar> sellectAll()
[12:18:35] <taplar> ?
[12:18:36] <taplar> typo?
[12:18:52] <d2k> can I ask for something easier: how to reset a focused element? I was searching the web for months, found nothing that worked in my case
[12:19:17] <JZA> well d3 works, whta is not working is the filterTable()
[12:19:29] <taplar> ^ you see my last question?
[12:19:43] <JZA> yeah I dunno how to address the newly created table
[12:20:01] <taplar> lol, no dude, is 'sellectAll' correct?  cause you have 'selectAll' else where
[12:20:17] <taplar> 2 l's vs 1
[12:20:22] <JZA> oh right, typo
[12:22:28] <JZA> so  i get 2 erors now
[12:22:51] <JZA> SyntaxError: missing } after property list
[12:23:16] <JZA> I guess is the one on line 9
[12:23:26] <taplar> you have a ; inside your object
[12:23:43] <JZA> yeah after inputSelector
[12:23:58] <d2k> thanks so far guys, I will try to get more to the point next time
[12:24:30] <taplar> also this convo seems more related to d3 issues.  you should checkout the #d3.js room
[12:24:41] <taplar> probably get better support
[12:24:52] <d2k> roger that
[12:25:23] <taplar> d2k: that was for JZA
[12:25:46] <JZA> really? I tihnk it has to do with the jquery table plugin...
[12:26:09] <JZA> if I delete lines 7-9 the whole thing works flawlessly
[12:26:10] <taplar> i don't see any jquery in this pastie
[12:26:24] <JZA> filterTable
[12:26:24] <taplar> selectors aren't a jquery only thing, :)
[12:26:45] <JZA> <script src="jquery.filtertable.min.js"></script>
[12:27:16] <JZA> http://sunnywalker.github.io/jQuery.FilterTable/
[12:27:24] <JZA> here is the demo: http://sunnywalker.github.io/jQuery.FilterTable/examples/filtertable-existing-input.html
[12:27:48] <JZA> that works also ok with a normal table, but d3 is the one generating the table.
[12:28:09] <JZA> I just want to merge both functionalities.
[12:28:27] <taplar> i'm not sure they're the same thing
[12:28:30] <taplar> $('table').filterTable
[12:28:40] <JZA> one to generate the table and another to apply the filterTable filter.
[12:28:42] <taplar> but your doing d3.stuff().stuff().filterTable
[12:28:52] <JZA> right, because there is no table before
[12:29:00] <JZA> the html only have the filter form
[12:29:05] <JZA> here is the whole source
[12:29:10] <taplar> right, but your assuming stuff().stuff() is returning a jquery object
[12:29:12] <taplar> is that the case?
[12:29:44] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/1MBBTK1
[12:30:04] <taplar> i understand your importing that plugin
[12:30:26] <taplar> but i still am unsure that the selectAll() off of the d3 library is returning a jquery object
[12:31:12] <taplar> but like i said, i'm not familiar with d3
[12:31:17] <JZA> I just want to apply the filter to the table that was appended by d3
[12:31:32] <taplar> so then select it with jquery and do that method
[12:31:35] <JZA> is not d3, is regular jquery
[12:32:48] <JZA> .add('table')
[12:33:09] <JZA> now I need that table to get .filterTable()
[12:33:57] * taplar taplar_lunch
[12:35:00] <taplar> i really think your going to have to select it with jquery, not d3.  someone else may correct me.  but i feel like your trying to combine libraries that are not inherently combined
[12:35:04] <taplar> bbs
[12:38:36] <JZA> this works perfect: http://dpaste.com/01E2JK1
[12:38:52] <JZA> I only need to apply a filter effect to the table
[12:51:46] <d2k> hey taplar and JZA, I followed your advice and this a addClass but now I can't do a removeClass, why is that?
[12:52:00] <robertmaxrees> define "can't" :)
[12:52:43] <AdamPDotty> try, just a little bit harder
[12:53:15] <d2k> http://dpaste.com/1ZETGED
[12:53:36] <d2k> on line 13
[12:54:02] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not using a delegated listener for that instead?
[12:55:47] <d2k> robertmaxrees: I'm not sure if I know what a delegated listiner could be. I wonder why removeClass is not working
[12:56:00] <AdamPDotty> I do not see it at once
[12:56:07] <AdamPDotty> looks right on first glance
[12:56:10] <robertmaxrees> is any of the other code in that handler working?
[12:56:26] <d2k> yes all the non commented code works well
[12:56:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it break then.
[12:56:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't see where you set that class on that element fwiw.,
[12:57:07] <d2k> i can give you the link to the real output:
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> sure - feel free to link it to the channel.  a fiddle would be even better.
[12:57:39] <d2k> https://www.bebe.com.py/desa/index.php?route=product/category&path=59 ...please open with chrome devtools smartphone mode (should be android)
[12:58:07] <robertmaxrees> and then what?
[12:58:18] <d2k> when you scroll you will see a blue box on the left
[12:58:36] <d2k> when you click it it adds a class called "onfocus"
[12:59:01] <d2k> when you click the button on the rightside (once opened) it should remove "onfocus" class
[12:59:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:59:42] <robertmaxrees> i see two click handlers bound to that element.
[12:59:47] <robertmaxrees> "ocultar"
[13:00:05] <d2k> yeah
[13:00:12] <robertmaxrees> so first off
[13:00:13] <robertmaxrees> var jqnc = jQuery.noConflict();
[13:00:15] <d2k> that "ocultar" is the close button
[13:00:18] <robertmaxrees> don't do that in every click event handler.
[13:00:19] <robertmaxrees> do that once.
[13:00:27] <d2k> ok
[13:00:37] <d2k> will try that
[13:00:42] <robertmaxrees> at the top of the onload handler.
[13:01:04] <AdamPDotty> should still work
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> second - you need to test to see if the element is open or not.
[13:01:39] <AdamPDotty> oops, missed that
[13:01:39] <d2k> so I should do a console.log?
[13:01:41] <robertmaxrees> you're using focusout.
[13:01:45] <robertmaxrees> not what you want.
[13:02:05] <d2k> focusout is not in use at the moment I just kept it but I could delete it
[13:02:33] <d2k> jqnc('.swipe-indicator').click(function(e) is what I'm trying to modify
[13:02:56] <robertmaxrees> basically, jqnc('.swipe-indicator').click(function(e) { and jqnc('.maincontent-leftcol-listing').bind('click', function() { are both firing.
[13:03:06] <d2k> oh I see
[13:03:11] <robertmaxrees> you need one handler, not two, that checks to see if stuff is open or not.,
[13:04:03] <d2k> ok I will modify it according to your words
[13:04:15] <robertmaxrees> do you understand the idea?
[13:05:05] <d2k> kinda
[13:05:27] <d2k> the thing is jqnc('.maincontent-leftcol-listing').bind('click', function()  is for addClass
[13:05:43] <d2k> jqnc('.swipe-indicator').click(function(e) should be removing it
[13:05:43] <robertmaxrees> right, so instead of doing the two hanbdlers, you have one.
[13:05:48] <robertmaxrees> right, they're both firing.
[13:05:52] <robertmaxrees> both handlers are running.
[13:06:20] <robertmaxrees> so instead of adding a handler to .swipe-handler, you remove that and modify .maincontent-leftcol-listing to check if the menu is open.
[13:06:27] <robertmaxrees> if it is open, remove class, etc.
[13:06:32] <robertmaxrees> if it's not, add class, etc.
[13:07:01] <d2k> ok, this sounds straight forward
[13:08:05] <d2k> will try and report back asap
[13:35:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/eu2a0am8/ hmm filter doesn't seem to be doing anything
[13:35:16] <taplar> slightly funny that the docs page examples are also broken
[13:46:11] <tata> i want to start sql database
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> wrong channel? :)
[13:46:19] <tata> don't know where to even start
[13:46:26] <tata> oopse
[13:46:34] <tata> i thought this is channel for internet
[13:46:36] <tata> :)
[13:46:51] <taplar> you think highly of us
[13:47:00] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:47:10] <taplar> what do you know?
[13:47:13] <taplar> ALL the things!
[13:49:29] <cr0mulent> Hello, I need to change the css for a project that uses jquery. Should I directly modify jquery-ui.css or is there a way to override css styles from a different css file. Should I make a new css file and use !important or is that bad form?
[13:49:47] <robertmaxrees> make a new file and include it after.
[13:49:59] <robertmaxrees> use the same selectors or more specific selectors and you're fine.
[13:50:17] <taplar> repeating rules should overwrite old ones
[13:50:21] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:50:29] <taplar> but i mean at a granular level
[13:50:43] <taplar> so if one does color and size, and you later define size, the old color rule would still exist
[13:51:08] <cr0mulent> taplar: robertmaxrees: thank you.
[14:24:37] <sdubois> looking for some help writing a couple selectors
[14:24:39] <sdubois> http://pastebin.com/pBzY8HAs
[14:25:06] <sdubois> i want to move all the .row-even divs after an h3 to .left-col and .row-odd to .right-col
[14:25:32] <sdubois> but only the divs after an h3, not the ones after the next
[14:26:30] <sdubois> if it just to $('.row-even').appendTo('.left-col'); for example that adds EVERY row-even to both left-col divs
[14:26:56] <jphase> sdubois: look into using .each() and .nextUntil()
[14:27:12] <taplar> you don't have any common wrapper around each piece, which would be great
[14:27:21] <jphase> ^ that'd be better heh
[14:27:31] <sdubois> limited to the output of my CMS at the moment
[14:27:51] <taplar> so you'll have to do something with prev()
[14:28:40] <sdubois> hmm
[14:31:24] <sdubois> this is confusing lol
[14:38:45] <sdubois> might it be easier to add a wrapper first with jquery?
[14:38:57] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4asnnpv3/
[14:40:42] <sdubois> yo thanks!
[14:40:44] <sdubois> makes sense
[14:45:15] <Akimb> Using jquery ajax to post data to one php file, getting 302 http error and cross-origin policy breach, what could be the problem?
[14:45:38] <taplar> your trying to post to another domain
[14:45:46] <taplar> security wise, that's not allowed by default
[14:46:32] <taplar> the site that your trying to post to would have to enable that cors request
[14:49:42] <Akimb> I am posting to that same domain
[14:50:02] <taplar> the domain your posting to is the same domain the ajax request is coming from?
[14:50:36] <Akimb> the ajax file is in portalas/html of domain and the php file is portalas/php/email/email_send.php
[14:51:05] <taplar> not sure then
[14:51:19] <taplar> can you do a normal form submit to that file?
[14:51:22] <Akimb> Interesting thing is that when I try to manualy type the path into browser, I can access the file
[14:52:47] <Akimb> origin and referrer have to match to not trigger cors error, right?
[14:53:34] <taplar> if your ajaxing to the same domain, nothing should cause a cors, afaik
[14:53:45] <taplar> cause the 'co' doesn't apply
[14:54:16] <taplar> which is why i'm wondering if a form submit works
[14:54:22] <Akimb> It works
[14:54:29] <taplar> weird
[14:54:42] <taplar> what does your ajax call look like?
[14:55:51] <Akimb> $.post('../php/email/email_send.php', {"admin-send": "true"}); - I don't need the respnse
[14:56:20] <Akimb> basically what I want to do, when the user submits, I get an email
[14:56:48] <taplar> and your on something like "http://mydomain/html" ?
[14:57:18] <Akimb> The host is redirecting to html/portalas
[14:57:41] <Akimb> portalas/html*
[14:58:05] <taplar> so your on something like "http://mydomain/mypage.html" ?
[14:59:23] <taplar> which, btw, you may want to rethink that.  how are you validating that you should send an email?
[14:59:23] <Akimb> http://domain/portalas/html/index.php is the home page(yea, it's weird)
[15:00:28] <taplar> ok, seems right.  and your network tab is showing it's making the correct ajax call?
[15:04:19] <Akimb> Getting two errors in network tab one post (302 I mentioned) and another from web hosting
[15:04:41] <taplar> but the url it tried to go to was correct in the network tab?
[15:05:07] <taplar> cause a 302 isn't an error, necessarily
[15:05:11] <taplar> just a redirect
[15:06:33] <Akimb> checking sec
[15:09:48] <Akimb> ffs, instead of email_send it's send_email... now it works :/
[15:09:57] <taplar> :)
[15:10:33] <Akimb> Thanks for the help, I appreciate it <3
[15:10:39] <taplar> so back to my other question.  how are you validating that the script should send an email?
[15:11:09] <taplar> cause i see {"admin-send": "true"} as input, so that would make me nervous
[15:11:33] <Akimb> So the form has some validation for user input. If everything is ok and the users succesfully submits the data, the email is sent. Should I make some additional precautions?
[15:12:00] <taplar> so your saying so long as that url is hit, it's going to send an email?
[15:12:46] <Akimb> yes, as well as if the form is submitted. well if js is turned off.. i see what you mean
[15:13:06] <taplar> so question
[15:13:16] <taplar> your going to send an email if the form is submitted
[15:13:23] <taplar> why not just do the email as part of that process?
[15:13:51] <taplar> cause as it is, the potential exists for someone to go crazy and start spam hitting that url and flood your inbox
[15:14:24] <Akimb> what do you mean 'part of that process'?
[15:14:40] <taplar> your submitting the form, and sending an email, right?
[15:14:44] <Akimb> yes
[15:14:57] <taplar> so those two pieces are really one process
[15:14:59] <Akimb> after the submit, but the validation is on php as well
[15:15:32] <taplar> so you validate, all is good and it submits to the backend to process the submit, which also could do the email
[15:16:23] <taplar> otherwise your going to want to do some sort of xss token for that endpoint
[15:16:44] <Akimb> so instead of making seperate link to email code, I could basically put everything in one file and then write the proper logic in there? As it stands now,as you say, someone might as well go and execute that link with php files repeatedly
[15:16:54] <taplar> yup
[15:17:25] <taplar> why have two endpoints?  do you sometimes only submit the form?  do you sometimes only send the email?
[15:17:41] <Akimb> No, submit -> then send always :)
[15:17:57] <Akimb> Thanks for the advice! I'll see what I can change
[15:18:12] <taplar> np, just trying to watch out for ya, ;)
[15:18:21] <taplar> spam sux
[15:19:33] <Akimb> <3
[15:28:23] <taplar> jQuery: come for js help, stay for security advice
[15:34:57] <simonsaysdiaf> lol
[15:35:06] <simonsaysdiaf> come for help stay becauyse u never did /part
[15:35:39] <taplar> right!
[15:36:22] <taplar> i'm really waiting for the day the server has a hiccup and everyone gets dumped, so I can hop back in and see how many people rejoin
[15:56:49] <zZap-X> how can one stop FOUC when using js on a webpage?
[15:57:27] <taplar> you don't?
[15:57:33] <zZap-X> oh :(
[15:57:42] <taplar> hide it until it is styled and then show it
[15:58:09] <taplar> which may mean the elements are hidden by default with css on page load
[15:58:19] <zZap-X> its actually a problem when my page loads the other bits appear on page in different orders
[15:58:33] <zZap-X> so it causes a flash effect, but its not unstyled
[15:58:54] <taplar> are the other bits already existing or are they created with ajax?
[15:58:56] <zZap-X> is there a way to delay the web page from loading until all the js has loased
[15:59:10] <zZap-X> taplar: i am using mediaelement audio and video player
[15:59:15] <taplar> a doc ready will delay until the scripts are loaded
[15:59:31] <zZap-X> taplar: how can one do that
[15:59:58] <taplar> $(document).ready(function(){ /* your logic here */ }) or shorthand $(function(){ ... });
[16:00:08] <zZap-X> like here:
[16:00:08] <zZap-X> http://www.learningjquery.com/2008/10/1-way-to-avoid-the-flash-of-unstyled-content
[16:00:37] <taplar> typically it should start off hidden and be revealed when it's ready
[16:00:46] <taplar> otherwise you get a glimpse of it before it's changed
[16:00:50] <zZap-X> i need to hide the whole of <html> then display it when ready
[16:01:00] <taplar> you could take that approach, sure
[16:01:07] <taplar> though, body, not html
[16:01:10] <zZap-X> ok
[16:01:24] <zZap-X> how can one specify body here?
[16:01:29] <zZap-X> $('body').hide();
[16:01:31] <taplar> $('body')
[16:01:38] <taplar> body { display: none; }
[16:01:38] <zZap-X> ace
[16:01:42] <zZap-X> will test
[16:01:44] <taplar> then $('body').show()
[16:02:22] <taplar> or throw up an overlay so you can't see the page until it's removed
[16:02:28] <taplar> different approaches, *shrugs*
[16:06:26] <zZap-X> jeeze even that code causes a flash then it hides
[16:07:00] <zZap-X> might be the css
[16:08:51] <zZap-X> using the hide method will always load the page with a slight delay of hidden
[16:09:03] <zZap-X> so the page will always have a small flash of nothing
[16:10:12] <taplar> are you hiding with css or with js?
[16:10:27] <zZap-X>  body { display: none; }
[16:10:27] <zZap-X> css
[16:10:31] <taplar> hmm
[16:10:33] <zZap-X> $('body').show();
[16:10:38] <zZap-X> after all the js
[16:10:41] <zZap-X> it works
[16:10:46] <zZap-X> but there is a small flicker
[16:10:50] <zZap-X> when page loads
[16:10:54] <taplar> shouldn't be a flash, unless your doing some formatting change after the show()
[16:10:54] <zZap-X> but that is to be expected
[16:11:11] <taplar> unless your calling seeing the blank page for a moment a 'flash'
[16:11:14] <zZap-X> taplar: there will be a flash because the body is hidden then it shows
[16:11:24] <zZap-X> taplar: yes thats what i mean
[16:11:32] <taplar> ah, then go with an overlay then
[16:11:36] <taplar> if you don't like that
[16:11:42] <zZap-X> oh how do i do that
[16:12:22] <taplar> an overlay is a div or something that is styled to be positioned absolute/fixed to the max width and height of the page and a z-index that puts it on top of everything
[16:12:35] <taplar> so it blocks your view, provided you give it a background color
[16:12:44] <zZap-X> oh i see
[16:12:48] <taplar> optionally you could put a spinner on it for loading
[16:12:51] <zZap-X> so i will see a flash of background colour instead
[16:12:55] <taplar> then when things are ready you hide that overlay
[16:13:13] <taplar> lol, sure i guess you could call that a flash
[16:13:18] <zZap-X> aye interesting
[16:13:25] <taplar> either way your going to have a brief moment where your not seeing your page
[16:13:37] <zZap-X> taplar: is that common in most websites?
[16:14:14] <taplar> i've seen it either way.  usually a website will have their background color set to match their loaded page so it's not really a white flash
[16:14:24] <taplar> it just looks like your content is loading
[16:14:26] <zZap-X> ok
[16:16:29] <zZap-X> i have a idea!!!!
[16:16:37] <zZap-X> how about a smooth fade in then it shows the web page
[16:17:02] <zZap-X> opacity change
[16:17:41] <zZap-X> so body hidden, javascripts load, then jquery does a opacity fade in
[16:18:41] * zZap-X tests
[16:19:18] <jeffleeismyhero> I have two arrays: headers and values. How can I merge these two arrays into a hash: {header: value}
[16:19:42] <zZap-X> $('body').css('opacity', '0').fadeTo(1500, 1,'swing');
[16:19:53] * zZap-X feels excited
[16:20:03] <taplar> jeffleeismyhero: same number of elements in each one?
[16:20:18] <zZap-X> that works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[16:20:39] <taplar> zZap-X: cool
[16:21:02] <zZap-X> ive never seen a webpage do this before :D
[16:25:38] <zZap-X> so js loads one by one
[16:25:47] <zZap-X> and that can cause delays
[16:26:03] <zZap-X> some people put js at the end of the webpage but you cannot always do that
[16:26:17] <zZap-X> especially with tabs etc
[16:27:51] <puff> Hi, I need to replace an old flash control and I'm looking at maybe using jquery knob to do it.  I have no jquery experience and little javascript, mostly I do java, python, occasionally php and back in the day perl.  So I'm looking for a pointer to a tutorial about jquery knob that starts from scratch.
[16:30:08] <robertmaxrees> "jquery knob"
[16:30:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:30:57] <robertmaxrees> puff you mean https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob ?
[16:32:26] <puff> Yeah.
[16:32:34] <robertmaxrees> so what do you need?
[16:32:44] <robertmaxrees> 'cause the readme seems pretty clear :)
[16:32:59] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob#example
[16:33:09] <sillyslux> there's even
[16:33:15] <sillyslux> hey
[16:33:21] <sillyslux> http://anthonyterrien.com/demo/knob/
[16:33:26] <sillyslux> there it is
[16:34:45] <puff> Well, most of the docs sort of skip over setting up jquery and etc.
[16:35:05] <robertmaxrees> you just make sure jquery is included first, then the script for the plugin, then yours.
[16:35:07] <puff> For example, I assume I'm going to need to add a tag that links to the jQuery Knob source, etc.
[16:35:12] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:35:16] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of all implied.
[16:35:19] <sillyslux> puff open chrome/firefox/edge developer tools and look at it's code, then copy-paste to your new empty website and try and try, if you run into problems you can use jsfiddle.net to show us where you have problems
[16:35:25] <puff> Right, except I haven't done javascript since 1999.
[16:35:29] <robertmaxrees> order is jquery, knob plugin, then your code.
[16:35:32] <puff> So I'm just looking for a bit more pointers.
[16:35:36] <robertmaxrees> literally just script tags.
[16:35:53] <robertmaxrees> <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/jquery.js">
[16:35:54] <robertmaxrees> etc
[16:36:16] <puff> I'm guessing  ./js/jquery.knob.js
[16:36:19] <puff> From the zip download.
[16:36:31] <robertmaxrees> depends entirely on where you put that file.
[16:36:49] <puff> Right, I'll put it under my webapp somewhere.
[16:37:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you'll need jquery before that.
[16:37:09] <puff> And I just need to include the jquery.js, don't need to do any setup or anything?
[16:37:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.  jquery exists emtirely under $, so there's no init or anything.
[16:37:30] <robertmaxrees> *entirely
[16:38:31] <puff> Cool, thanks.
[16:38:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:39:17] <puff> So basically a) <script> tag to src in jquery, b) <script> tag to src in jquery knob, c) scriplet for the function the knob will invoke, d) scriptlet for the knob itself.
[16:39:28] <robertmaxrees> "scriptlet"?
[16:39:34] <puff> Small script.
[16:40:00] <robertmaxrees> c and d should be the same file.
[16:40:39] <puff> Okay.
[16:41:27] <puff> The readme example has both an <input> tag and a <script> tag, at first I thought the <script> tag would be setting the value in the input, now I'm looking at it again and I think they mean either/or.
[16:45:01] <jeffleeismyhero> taplar: yes, it seems like map will work — $.map(headers, function(h, i) { return { metric: h, value: values[i] }; })
[16:45:23] <taplar> you might look into Arrays.prototype.reduce
[16:45:30] <taplar> depending on the browser support you need
[16:51:25] <puff> robertmaxrees: Yay, it works!
[16:51:31] <puff> robertmaxrees: Now I just need to tie it into my app code.
[16:52:07] <taplar> heh, jquery knob
[16:53:13] * taplar tries to find a segway into hob knobing
[17:45:27] <z1haze> how can I have en element position: fixed whiel scrolling, but calculate if the element is too close to the bottom, i want to change the fixed position to the bottom instead of the top?
[17:46:06] <taplar> so scroll event first off
[17:47:09] <taplar> though too close to the bottom?
[17:47:28] <z1haze> i want to avoid the fixed element overlapping the footer
[17:47:34] <z1haze> is my overall goal
[17:47:52] <z1haze> fixed to the top as long as it will fit while not overlapping the footer, if it gets to the point where it will overlap the foote, i want to fix it to he bottom instead
[17:48:12] <taplar> is this a menu?
[17:48:29] <z1haze> no
[17:48:35] <z1haze> like a shopping order summary
[17:49:49] <taplar> hmm, well idk if it would work the same way for you, but you might consider doing (i think its called) something like the quick reveal concept
[17:50:19] <taplar> where you hide the fixed top thing when the user scrolls down so far, but once they scroll up a certain amount you show it again
[17:51:16] <z1haze> i neve rwant to hide it
[17:51:28] <taplar> unless it is too close to the footer
[17:51:28] <z1haze> i just want it fixed proportional to the top as long as it will fit
[17:51:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused about when a heading could cover the footer.
[17:51:38] <z1haze> heading?
[17:51:58] <robertmaxrees> heh, so let's back up then.  can you show us the problem you're having?
[17:52:32] <z1haze> https://gyazo.com/8701053de86bcb5ac8552a50e89b74d2
[17:52:52] <z1haze> its position fixed after you scroll
[17:52:58] <z1haze> but since its fixed if i scroll too far
[17:53:00] <z1haze> i cover the footer
[17:53:02] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you have a cart summary widget that follows you around the page?
[17:53:07] <z1haze> yea
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> that's funky, but OK.
[17:53:30] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want a waypoint or something.
[17:53:50] <robertmaxrees> check if the bottom has hit a certain point above the footer and go from there.
[17:53:59] <z1haze> how would i do that?
[17:54:31] <robertmaxrees> start with the first step.
[17:54:36] <robertmaxrees> chekc if the bottom of the element has hit the footer.
[17:55:42] <z1haze> thats what im asking, how do i determine that?
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> check the potision of the bottom of the element.
[17:55:57] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[17:56:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd get the offset().top of the element and then add its height.
[17:57:33] <fas3r> hello
[17:57:44] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[17:58:19] <fas3r> can I get the id or class of the input on which a user is using backspace ?
[17:58:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.  the event target can give you all kinds of information, fas3r
[17:59:22] <fas3r> ok
[18:17:47] <ky> Hello. I'm having difficulty with the jquery click event. I have blocks within a grid that overflow into other cells. Those blocks have a click event but it only works when clicking on the part of the block within it's cell.
[18:17:59] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us?
[18:18:38] <ky> So the blue block at 6am has a click event. if I click on the part over the 6am row, it works. but when I click on the part over the 7am row it doesn't work. http://i.imgur.com/hkCHVLG.png
[18:18:54] <robertmaxrees> can you show us code?
[18:19:39] <ky> the html or the javascript?
[18:19:46] <robertmaxrees> both in a jsfiddle :)
[18:21:45] <ky> um, the whole file has a bunch of external css files it's using that I have locally. Would it be alright just to show the grid html and the javascript?
[18:21:53] <robertmaxrees> and any relevant css.
[18:21:57] <robertmaxrees> like, i just want a test case.
[18:21:59] <robertmaxrees> not the whole page.
[18:22:09] <ky> I'll make a test case. one second
[18:22:13] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[18:28:23] <ky> https://jsfiddle.net/cws4f0oa/
[18:29:06] <ky> you can see the click event is for the block that goes overtop of both cells. but the click event only occurs on the portion of the block that's over the first cell.
[18:29:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, probably a z-indexing issue.
[18:30:25] <robertmaxrees> if you right click the area you want to be clickable within that second element, you'll see that you end up selecting the cell.
[18:30:51] <ky> yea, how can I fix that so that it will select the element
[18:30:54] <z1haze> robertmaxrees: how do I check if my element is getting too close to the footer while scrolling?
[18:31:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i gave you a starting point.
[18:31:06] <z1haze> i know im doing this in a $(window).scroll(function() {
[18:31:16] <z1haze> i guess im still confused then
[18:31:27] <robertmaxrees> did you get the position of the bottom of the side nav?
[18:31:37] <robertmaxrees> errr summary or whatever?
[18:31:58] <z1haze> get offset of top and add it to its height is what you said
[18:32:15] <robertmaxrees> right. so did you do that?
[18:32:19] <z1haze> i dont understand it man
[18:32:25] <robertmaxrees> which part is confusing?
[18:32:49] <z1haze> currently i just check if the offset().top >= document scrollTop() + 77
[18:32:54] <z1haze> which is the amound of px from the top they want it to start
[18:33:06] <z1haze> but now i havce to figure out how to stop it when theres not enough space
[18:33:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:33:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm showing you how to get to that part.
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> so you have the bottom of the element.
[18:33:28] <z1haze> ok
[18:33:35] <robertmaxrees> now you want to compare to see if that number is greater than the top of whatever element you don't want it to go over.
[18:33:54] <z1haze> so $(.stickysummary').offset().top ?
[18:34:01] <robertmaxrees> the top of the footer.
[18:34:12] <z1haze> ok
[18:34:29] <robertmaxrees> you wantto check if the bottom of stickysummary > the top of the footer.
[18:34:32] <z1haze> so then just replace the stickysummary with footer
[18:34:37] <z1haze> how do i check the bottom of sticky summary though
[18:34:44] <robertmaxrees> i just explained that.
[18:34:56] <robertmaxrees> offset().top + height
[18:35:03] <z1haze> of the document?
[18:35:08] <robertmaxrees> of the summary./
[18:35:12] <robertmaxrees> why would you check the document?
[18:35:34] <ky> rob I think I found a fix. I added position: relative to the block and it brought it to the front
[18:35:44] <robertmaxrees> ky that's one way to do it :)
[18:35:54] <z1haze> ok so if($('.stickysummary').offset().top + $('.stickysummary').height() >= $('footer').offset().top ?
[18:36:06] <ky> robertmaxrees what do you think would be the best way? or is my way fine?
[18:36:11] <robertmaxrees> z1haze what do you think?
[18:36:17] <z1haze> i thin kthats correct
[18:36:21] <robertmaxrees> ky that should work fine.  i don't see any issues with that.
[18:36:25] <robertmaxrees> z1haze then start there.
[18:36:28] <ky> okay, thanks
[18:36:36] <robertmaxrees> you can check inside the scroll handler and see if that's right, z1haze
[18:36:40] <robertmaxrees> console.log() and all that.
[18:57:21] <creations> hey, I wanted to add a delete link to a list of mine, my list is formatted <li>..</li>
[18:57:30] <creations> what should I add, to create a delete button
[18:57:43] <creations> that identifies each list item
[18:57:57] <robertmaxrees> an <a> to each li.
[18:58:07] <creations> do I put the value of the item in the href?
[18:58:13] <creations> the key
[18:58:21] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[18:58:27] <robertmaxrees> you can get the parent LI from the click.
[18:58:40] <creations> well, its attached to database
[18:58:49] <creations> like where would be best place to put key value
[18:58:50] <robertmaxrees> so then back waaaaay up.
[18:59:07] <creations> i need a button i can press, which passes key value to delete
[18:59:08] <robertmaxrees> you'd like to remove the li as well as tell your backend to delete a row.
[18:59:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd give the anchor or the li a data attribute that's the key you want.
[18:59:41] <creations> anchor is putting value in href?
[18:59:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:59:51] <robertmaxrees> in a data attribute.
[19:00:00] <robertmaxrees> <a> = anchor.
[19:00:20] <creations> ic ok thanks i'm reading up on that now
[19:00:41] <robertmaxrees> <a href="#" data-key="someValue">delete</a>
[19:01:26] <creations> thanks, i was reading other examples and they used the key in the id, which seems wrong
[19:01:37] <robertmaxrees> eh, not really a good use for IDs.
[19:01:41] <robertmaxrees> it's one way do to it.
[19:12:34] <creations> hey I'm getting error, I pasted relevant parts here does anything seem wrong off bat https://jsfiddle.net/L5431npL/1/
[19:12:48] <robertmaxrees> what'
[19:12:51] <robertmaxrees> *What's the error?
[19:12:56] <robertmaxrees> and are you using jquery or native JS?
[19:13:15] <robertmaxrees> also - don't use delete as an id.
[19:13:19] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat an ID on a page.
[19:15:22] <creations> thanks good find, pretty new to all this
[19:15:54] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery or native js?
[19:16:50] <creations> both?
[19:17:05] <robertmaxrees> I don't see you using jquery at all in that fiddle.
[19:17:26] <robertmaxrees> so i'm wondering if I can make suggestions that'll make your life much easier.
[19:18:06] <creations> sure, I'm looking for any tutorials
[19:18:15] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[19:18:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:18:47] <creations> k
[19:22:38] <Saint_Isidore> hello I'm trying to submit a form I created on a wordpress site..but I keep getting an error "XMLHttpRequest cannot load..." I think the theme is trying to use a XMLHttpRequest to handle the form submission but I don'y want that. How can I isolate what script is stopping my form from submitting?
[19:22:52] <robertmaxrees> Saint_Isidore what's the full error?
[19:24:12] <Saint_Isidore> robertmaxrees 1 sec
[19:24:58] <Saint_Isidore> robertmaxrees    http://paste.ofcode.org/jpgHuTQFT7twFbH8nsUhw3
[19:25:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you're using an ajax call.
[19:25:40] <Saint_Isidore> ok I didn't write one so I take it js or jquery is stopping my form frmo submitting
[19:25:47] <Saint_Isidore> from submitting
[19:25:48] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[19:25:57] <robertmaxrees> the browser is stopping you from submitting cross-domain.
[19:27:16] <Saint_Isidore> so I added a plugin to allow xdomain submissions...and I don't get the error but the form never submits to the action url
[19:27:31] <robertmaxrees> right, because you cannot do that
[19:27:35] <Saint_Isidore> oh
[19:27:38] <Saint_Isidore> darn
[19:27:39] <robertmaxrees> the browser stops you because that's really insecure.
[19:27:47] <robertmaxrees> what's the other URL?
[19:28:15] <Saint_Isidore> action="https://bbb3478.infusionsoft.com/app/form/process/0ea19e5a3c9d93bd375a62eb1f57ce67"
[19:28:21] <robertmaxrees> basically, you need to be on the same port, protocol, and domain.
[19:28:40] <Saint_Isidore> but I'm trying to submit a webform to infusionsoft
[19:28:46] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, the domain you're submitting to needs to allow it.
[19:29:04] <robertmaxrees> do they say they allow what you're trying to do?
[19:29:12] <Saint_Isidore> that domain does... yes
[19:29:21] <robertmaxrees> because that domain doesn't support CORS right now.
[19:30:06] <Saint_Isidore> if I use the unstyled basic html there web their site provides..its submits just fine
[19:30:18] <robertmaxrees> right.  does it submit via ajax there?
[19:30:22] <robertmaxrees> or is it a normal form submit?
[19:30:29] <Saint_Isidore> no just an html form
[19:30:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so that'
[19:30:38] <robertmaxrees> *that's your issue.
[19:30:43] <Saint_Isidore> so this issue is ajax specifix correct?
[19:30:46] <Saint_Isidore> specific
[19:30:53] <robertmaxrees> correct.  are you trying to use ajax here?
[19:30:59] <Saint_Isidore> well I'm not
[19:31:05] <robertmaxrees> then something on your site is :)
[19:31:22] <Saint_Isidore> but I think something in this wordpress theme is somehow grabbing the form and trying to use ajax
[19:31:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.  i'd check the theme's docs and any plugins or w/e and see if any of those mention that.
[19:32:36] <Saint_Isidore> can you tell what about this form... ajax might be grabbing on it?  http://paste.ofcode.org/MAsr5nLfW6GWsbi54eV787
[19:32:47] <robertmaxrees> nope
[19:32:50] <robertmaxrees> because that's the html.
[19:32:57] <robertmaxrees> the javascript is what you care about.,
[19:33:19] <Saint_Isidore> Is there any way in dev tools to see what script runs on 'submit' ?
[19:33:25] <Saint_Isidore> so I can find that darn js
[19:33:36] <robertmaxrees> you could check the form's event listeners to see what handlers are bound to it.
[19:33:45] <Saint_Isidore> sorry about these noob questions :(
[19:33:49] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[19:34:32] <Saint_Isidore> woudl it most likely be a 'click' event?
[19:34:37] <robertmaxrees> submit handler.
[19:34:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing.
[19:35:43] <Saint_Isidore> your right...think I found it
[19:36:40] <Saint_Isidore> http://paste.ofcode.org/pUPRDUFaiXi92WcfXjna5L
[19:36:54] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[19:44:03] <Saint_Isidore> robertmaxrees Thank you very much, I think I'm in the right direction now! :)
