[14:19:30] <physikoi> oops, bear with me
[14:22:56] <physikoi> Hi #jquery. Not really sure where to ask this question as it straddles multiple technologies. When it comes to handling dynamic content, here is how I'm doing it on one of my projects: 1. page is loaded. 2. Interact with some widget. 3. event listener function makes an ajax post request. 4. The target file on the backend "catches" the request in some conditional block. 5. Block has some function that
[14:22:57] <physikoi> echos it's response. 6. Said ajaxpost callback handles the response and then may write the data to some elements in the DOM. My question is this: is this the Right Way to do such a flow? I just feel like there must be a less cumbersome way.
[14:37:04] <shoky> physikoi: yes that sounds right.. using something like React can help make the event listeners + DOM updating a bit nicer (especially if you have lots of these).  doesn't help you with the request+response to/from the server tho
[14:38:49] <physikoi> Thank you, shoky. Without adding an additional framework, perhaps there are common pitfalls that I should be aware of? My code works; it just seems so messy.
[14:42:17] <Northwoods> Do i need to convert $(".price").val to Number before i do calcutaion or jquery will do that for me
[14:49:18] <Cork> Northwoods: .val() will always give you a string
[14:49:23] <Cork> just like elm.value
[14:49:42] <Northwoods> so i need to convert that to Number
[14:49:55] <Northwoods> Thanks Cork
[14:50:01] <Cork> simplest is to do +$('.price').val() + 1 or similar (notice the first +)
[14:50:57] <Northwoods> hmm..
[14:51:10] <Northwoods> ok
[16:56:07] <physikoi> Northwoods: you could use ParseInt or ParseFloat if you don't want to use type coercion
[16:58:08] <Northwoods> physikoi, ok thanks
[16:59:00] <Northwoods> physikoi, how can i do calculation on each row , like on blur i want to calculate discount and tax on order total  -> http://prntscr.com/ugo4sb
[16:59:47] <Northwoods> $(this).closest('.row').find('.inputDiscount');
[16:59:51] <Northwoods> doing somethign like this
[17:00:04] <physikoi> You could do something like $("tr", "#table-name").each(function(element) { .. }
[17:00:07] <physikoi> something like that
[17:01:23] <Northwoods> what will be trigger element , onchange of any like , .dis , .tax , .shipcost , .ordtotal
[17:01:35] <Northwoods> anyway , let me see
[17:19:52] <Northwoods> physikoi, parseInt was bad idea
[17:20:03] <physikoi> why?
[17:20:34] <Northwoods> It kept getting Nan
[17:20:40] <Northwoods> with .val()
[17:24:36] <physikoi> sounds like the value is a zero length string. You'll have to check for that.
[17:25:02] <physikoi> And of course parseInt is for integers. If you're dealing with floats, you'll want parseInt.
[17:26:12] <physikoi> so. `const val = $("selector").val() != "" ? parseInt($("selector").val()) : fallbackValue`
[17:26:50] <physikoi> and there's always  more than one way to skin a cat, as they say.
