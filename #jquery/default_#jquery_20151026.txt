[00:02:25] <Justice> I was more thinking about doing regular html way.
[00:04:48] <Justice> multipart/form-data, with files true and then just get the file and inputs in php, maybe im missing something really obvious quite late and I do that by blade so maybe....
[00:05:06] <JosefDe> Is there a better option than doing it like this?:
[00:05:10] <JosefDe>  var other_data = $('form').serializeArray();
[00:05:10] <JosefDe>     $.each(other_data,function(key,input){
[00:05:10] <JosefDe>         fd.append(input.name,input.value);
[00:05:12] <JosefDe>     });

[02:36:14] <jacks> Hi all how are u all ?
[02:40:38] <jacks> Hi aruo_r
[02:40:48] <jacks> Hi arup_r
[02:41:40] <jak2016> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99dh7ozx/   <--- how to check if a value is typed in a input? sample if in input1, i type 780 and in input2 i type 780 i want display a error message, how to? how to start?
[02:42:34] <Cork> jak2016: bind an input event handler on the input fields
[02:42:43] <Cork> and check the values on the two fields
[02:44:00] <jak2016> ok
[02:55:49] <jak2016> Cork other thing: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/3x2mtcz4/1/
[02:56:19] <jak2016> i want display the value typed on the div.... in blur event i try the fiddle but not work
[02:56:46] <Cork> jak2016: your grabbing the value of the first input
[02:57:22] <Cork> you want to either use "this" to reference the currently active input, or loop the set of matched elements
[02:57:56] <jak2016> i want display the currently value
[03:01:27] <jak2016> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/3x2mtcz4/6/ fixed but always get the first input
[03:16:10] <arup_r> hi Jacks
[03:16:24] <hellyeah> yo
[03:16:35] <hellyeah> i will create buttons
[03:16:46] <hellyeah> should i wrap this operation with AJAX call?
[03:20:13] <Kartagis> is it possible to redirect the ajax call's results to another page?
[03:20:39] <Kartagis> s/redirect/append/
[03:20:39] <b-ot> Correction, <Kartagis> is it possible to append the ajax call's results to another page?
[03:20:54] <Kartagis> thank you b-ot
[03:21:29] <Cork> Kartagis: no you can't append something to another page
[03:21:49] <Cork> that would be xss
[03:22:19] <Kartagis> Cork: not even if I do .load("otherpage.html") afterwards?
[03:22:40] <Cork> not even sure what that would do in this context
[03:22:53] <Cork> Kartagis: you can make an ajax call and append it to the current page
[03:23:08] <Cork> you can't make an ajax call and then append it to a page your are not currently on
[03:26:57] <jak2016> done tanks
[04:02:35] <jak2016> how do it with jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/dyj76dwp/2/ if you see a scroll bars. how do it: when user press the button move to the end or better move the scroll some position? thanks
[04:09:14] <zeroquake> is there a way to pass context into jquery.each like the way we for array.forEach
[04:10:39] <Cork> zeroquake: it inherits scope just like every other function
[04:10:54] <Cork> just use the variables you have in the wrapping scope
[04:11:00] <zeroquake> yes , we can do something that = this in outer function
[04:11:07] <ZeuZ> is anyone around?
[04:11:46] <zeroquake> but in array.forEach you can pass this as a argument parameter and continue using "this" instead of some other variable name
[04:12:47] <Cork> zeroquake: this has a meaning inside .each so you normally don't want to do that
[04:13:05] <Cork> but sure, you can use .bind() or $.proxy to override the this variable .each uses
[04:13:19] <zeroquake> damn forgot about .bind
[04:13:23] <zeroquake> thank you.
[04:16:48] <ZeuZ> Could someone take a look at this: http://190.17.31.54/JavaScript/demo.html --> why does clicking each one of the different filters render the same result? as in, you click :google: and get :logo: (the last one always)
[04:18:22] <ZeuZ> if it wasn't for font-awesome I'd jsfiddle it
[04:19:24] <Cork> you can use awesome on jsfiddle too
[04:19:53] <ZeuZ> really? hotlinking is allowed for font awesome?
[04:20:22] <Cork> those fonts exist on cdns
[04:20:41] <Cork> https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/
[04:20:49] <Cork> anyway too much code to dig through
[04:21:19] <Calinou> it is "allowed" because it's free software...
[04:21:22] <Calinou> (free as in freedom)
[04:21:32] <Calinou> this is not Google Analytics or even Highcharts :)
[04:21:44] <Cork> Calinou: free doesn't mean hotlinking is allowed
[04:21:59] <Cork> cdns are meant to be used though, so that is another matter
[04:22:04] <Calinou> often, those JavaScript libraries are available over CDNs
[04:22:28] <Cork> this isn't a javascript lib though...
[04:22:33] <Calinou> CSS in this case
[04:23:10] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/u50gdyae/ ---> there, problem is on line 38
[04:26:36] <Cork> ZeuZ: 1. don't use made up attributes unless you prefix it with data-
[04:26:43] <Cork> 2. don't add event handlers in a loop
[04:26:47] <Cork> 3. don't use alert for debugging
[04:27:01] <ZeuZ> Cork, lol, taken! :)
[04:27:13] <ZeuZ> I thought it would be easier to do them in a loop for each one of them
[04:27:28] <ZeuZ> how would you add the event handlers?
[04:27:29] <Cork> 4. don't use for in for arrays
[04:27:34] <Cork> it will bug out
[04:27:48] <ZeuZ> Noted, what do I use in arrays then?
[04:28:46] <Cork> 5. don't append in a loop
[04:28:50] <Cork> that will kill performance
[04:29:03] <Cork> (writing the code as i list this :) )
[04:29:30] <Cork> though that said filter_container isn't in the dom yet
[04:31:52] <ZeuZ> so that point can be partially taken for now right? :)
[04:31:58] <Cork> ZeuZ: as the fiddle isn't complete i can't test this, but this should work http://jsfiddle.net/u50gdyae/1/
[04:32:40] <Cork> ZeuZ: var target = $('target'); /* loop */ target.append() * /* end loop */ would be ya
[04:32:45] <Cork> but in your case it was fine
[04:33:39] <Cork> opps missed the closing brackets http://jsfiddle.net/u50gdyae/2/
[04:34:20] <Cork> ZeuZ: also note var defined inside an if case won't be conditionally defined
[04:34:32] <Cork> as far is function scoped not block scoped
[04:34:36] <Cork> uh..
[04:34:47] <Cork> s/as far/as var/
[04:34:47] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> as var is function scoped not block scoped
[04:34:59] <Cork> got to love that feature :)
[04:35:30] <Cork> (and why let is SUCH a nice feature or es6)
[04:35:57] <ZeuZ> hmm for some reason the bar where the filters are listed is empty
[04:36:12] <ZeuZ> that being with your code Corky..
[04:36:21] <ZeuZ> maybe I'm overlooking something let me check
[04:36:30] <Cork> could you add the missing js so it works?
[04:36:35] <Cork> i mean the original fiddle
[04:37:23] <Cork> ah, the .load is what is breaking things
[04:37:51] <ZeuZ> in the original fiddle?
[04:37:56] <ZeuZ> what did I overlook there?
[04:38:10] <ZeuZ> the code is complete though with that alone I'm generating it here
[04:38:10] <Cork> you had ondomready
[04:38:16] <Cork> and insdie that you had on load
[04:38:20] <Cork> so the event never fired
[04:38:28] <Cork> anyway i replaced the invalid attributes
[04:38:35] <Cork> and that might be why your code isn't working
[04:39:36] <isthisreallife> https://dpaste.de/e4jq
[04:39:42] <isthisreallife> why alert doesn't show up?
[04:39:53] <isthisreallife> how to iterate through son result?
[04:40:04] <ZeuZ> take a look at the original jsfiddle, if set to onDomReady it should say " google yahoo logo"
[04:40:22] <ZeuZ> but on your fiddle it does not populate it
[04:40:46] <Cork> ZeuZ: ya, cause i removed the use of invalid attributes
[04:40:56] <Cork> they should use .data or .attr('data-*') instead
[04:42:48] <ZeuZ> I changed it to use .data on every slide, and yet, it still doesn't populate
[04:43:02] <ZeuZ> (also somehow your fiddle breaks the animations :P)
[04:43:23] <Cork> ZeuZ: http://jsfiddle.net/u50gdyae/4/
[04:43:31] <Cork> there that should be cleaned up
[04:46:51] <ZeuZ> pretty much yeah, I just needed to change the attr to data..
[04:47:13] <Cork> ZeuZ: should prob explain why what you had before was bad
[04:47:19] <ZeuZ> I still need to understand what you did with that code.. but will do as soon as I read the map function
[04:47:26] <ZeuZ> yes, please :)
[04:47:28] <Cork> the html spec has dedicated a namespace for site made up attributes
[04:47:40] <Cork> it is <elm data-what-ever-you-like="value">
[04:47:54] <Cork> this is so your added attributes won't conflict with future spec changes
[04:47:59] <Cork> and break
[04:48:16] <Cork> when download was added to <a> for example this was a problem
[04:48:27] <Cork> and some spec changes has had to be renamed cause of conflict
[04:48:27] <isthisreallife> https://dpaste.de/hGgv why can't i put each in there??
[04:48:37] <Cork> so never ever use none standard attributes without data-
[04:48:59] <ZeuZ> Cork, got it
[04:49:19] <Cork> isthisreallife: do tell, why can't you? :)
[04:49:20] <silverdust> what of ng-* ?
[04:49:23] <silverdust> :D
[04:49:34] <Cork> joke aside, you need to provide more context
[04:49:46] <isthisreallife> i get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
[04:49:58] <Cork> AH
[04:50:01] <Cork> now i see
[04:50:13] <Cork> isthisreallife: events: {} is an object
[04:50:15] <Cork> not a function
[04:50:30] <Cork> so you can't run code there
[04:50:53] <Cork> silverdust: ya, that is a good example of the problem that made them add data- to the spec
[04:51:59] <isthisreallife> Cork   https://dpaste.de/y4zX
[04:52:11] <isthisreallife> i need to get events using ajax
[04:52:17] <isthisreallife> and put it in there somehow
[04:52:18] <Cork> isthisreallife: ya, i missed the problem, already answered why this doesn't work
[04:52:40] <isthisreallife> look at 2nd link
[04:53:02] <isthisreallife> so how to i put my son in there
[04:53:04] <isthisreallife> json*
[04:53:30] <Cork> you would have to generate the object between line 2-3 and then use that object in line 4
[04:53:59] <isthisreallife> could you please show me some code example?
[04:54:04] <isthisreallife> newbie here

[05:36:48] <realnot> but seems that none of the solutions proposed there works
[05:43:05] <realnot> ok, solved it ":)

[05:45:01] <Xatenev> and in the html attribute i have <input data-zip="0" ... >
[05:45:09] <Xatenev> why would it not work? .p
[05:51:29] <Xatenev> solvd
[05:52:26] <Cork> Xatenev: note "not work" is too fuzzy for that question
[05:52:51] <Cork> you should have said what part didn't do what
[05:53:29] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I have this construction:
[05:54:00] <JosefDe> $(function() {

[05:54:00] <JosefDe> 		alert(str);
[05:54:02] <JosefDe> 	}
[05:54:04] <JosefDe> });
[05:54:06] <JosefDe> printString('Hello');
[05:54:09] <JosefDe> But the function is not called. How can I fix this?
[05:54:12] <Cork> JosefDe: don't dump code in the channel
[05:54:15] <Cork> use jsfiddle
[05:54:19] <JosefDe> ok, sorry
[06:00:15] <robhol>  why would it be called

[06:53:57] <Kartagis> it works with odd number of images
[06:55:03] <isthisreallife> okay nvm
[07:17:56] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I want to achieve this: I have a hidden input-field and I'm writing into this field. Now the problem is: I'm listening to the "change"-event on this hidden input-field. The problem is: If the newly written value is the same as the current value the "change" event is not triggered. How can I fix this?
[07:27:34] <Cork> JosefDe: uh... hidden fields don't have any ui
[07:27:40] <Cork> so how would a user write into it?
[07:51:07] <robhol> Cork: that doesn't mean it can't change :p
[07:54:44] <Kartagis> I need help with this dreadful code
[07:58:35] <robhol> Cork: besides, changing the content of a hidden field is trivial
[08:05:09] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/okzhy15y/1/ <--- I've got this code, but it blows if the number of field_fotograflar.src is either 2 or even. how come
[08:08:55] <hellyeah> yo
[08:09:02] <hellyeah> anyone here use es6-shim
[08:10:25] <taplar> Kartagis: field_fotograflar is an array
[08:10:32] <taplar> trying to do .src directly off of it won't work
[08:11:03] <Kartagis> taplar: I can output it though
[08:11:07] <hellyeah> DAMN
[08:11:23] <hellyeah> jquery has something for "promise"?
[08:11:39] <taplar> Kartagis: your second part is looping through each one
[08:13:01] <taplar> i guess i'm not sure what your trying to do with the conditional
[08:13:02] <Kartagis> taplar: when you say "won't work", are you talking about the first or second part
[08:13:09] <taplar> first part
[08:13:47] <taplar> your json is structured so that 'field_fotograflar' is an array, so to get to src you'd have to do field_fotograflar[0].src
[08:14:20] <Kartagis> I can output if the number is 2 (ie user has got picture
[08:14:25] <taplar> but your trying to get the keys of an array which is weird
[08:15:36] <hellyeah> jquery promise is deferred?
[08:15:45] <taplar> it's a type of deferred
[08:16:16] <hellyeah> should i use es6 primise or jquery promise?
[08:16:30] <hellyeah> do i need to include shim?_
[08:16:37] <taplar> i'm unfamiliar with es6
[08:17:14] <hellyeah> do you suggest me to use jquery promise?
[08:17:48] <hellyeah> humm
[08:17:51] <hellyeah> weird question
[08:17:53] <taplar> i would ask that question to someone else.  since i'm not familiar I can't give an informed suggestion
[08:18:11] <hellyeah> you are not familiar with promise?
[08:18:18] <taplar> not the es6 one
[08:18:25] <taplar> if that's a thing
[08:19:17] <hellyeah> i would prefer jquery promise because i have to incude es6-shim
[08:19:25] <hellyeah> and i.e. does not support es6
[08:19:41] <hellyeah> shim does not guarantee it is 100% functional

[08:21:47] <isthisreallife> as a newbie i console log all the time
[08:21:57] <isthisreallife> and many alerts were there to help me
[08:22:00] <isthisreallife> but I'm stuck
[08:22:10] <isthisreallife> I'm out of ideas
[08:22:29] <isthisreallife> help needed
[08:22:47] <taplar> so you console loged the length of the selector on ln 48 and it was > 0?
[08:23:01] <isthisreallife> wai wat
[08:23:04] <isthisreallife> wait wat*
[08:23:14] <isthisreallife> sure man
[08:23:15] * hellyeah waiting for you
[08:23:25] <isthisreallife> everything cool in this line
[08:24:00] <isthisreallife> console.log in line 7 shows that month is changed
[08:24:18] <isthisreallife> so what now
[08:24:21] <isthisreallife> what do i do
[08:24:57] <isthisreallife> taplar u still there?
[08:24:58] <taplar> ln 49, where is month defined?
[08:25:08] <isthisreallife> sure
[08:25:21] <isthisreallife> i just want previous month
[08:25:40] <isthisreallife> so when i click it i get '9'
[08:25:43] <isthisreallife> instead of 10
[08:25:47] <isthisreallife> thats how it works
[08:25:49] <taplar> i'm asking, where is it defined?  i see you using that variable.  i do not see it defined
[08:25:58] <isthisreallife> line 3
[08:26:11] <isthisreallife> you see?
[08:26:45] <taplar> k, so your using window.month to make it global
[08:27:15] <isthisreallife> yes
[08:27:17] <isthisreallife> thats right
[08:28:07] <taplar> ok, so if you put a console.log(window.month) on ln 50 after you adjust it, what do you get?
[08:28:55] <taplar> i wonder if your running into scope issues
[08:29:10] <isthisreallife> 9
[08:29:20] <isthisreallife> it changed :)
[08:29:35] <taplar> set_calendar is defined inside the document ready, but your trying to call it from outside.  i wonder if that is an issue
[08:29:53] <hellyeah> promise

[08:30:39] <isthisreallife> this is full js

[08:33:52] <taplar> what's with the {#   #}
[08:33:55] <taplar> ?
[08:34:29] <isthisreallife> its commented out line
[08:34:52] <isthisreallife> don't look at it ;p
[08:35:38] <taplar> never seen comments like those, and i get an error when putting it in jsfiddle.  typical comments in javascript are single line "//" or multiline "/*   */"
[08:36:31] <isthisreallife> yea sorry
[08:36:34] <isthisreallife> its django template
[08:36:44] <isthisreallife> just delete it
[08:36:44] <isthisreallife> ;p
[08:39:27] <Kartagis> this client is driving me nuts
[08:40:52] <taplar> isthisreallife: http://jsfiddle.net/24Lhjvr6/ <-- i don't believe it is going into the each
[08:48:10] <M|6> Hello, I'm wondering if anyone can help me, i'm having a heck of a time getting Collapse to work properly, It should be all collapsed on page load, yet it seems to be expanded and will only collapse on click. Can anyone take a look and maybe suggest something? Cause i've been at it for a while and i might be going crazy here is the demo http://www.forgetfulmail.com/test/
[08:50:49] <Tennis> m|6 are you calling it collapse on document ready?
[08:51:18] <Tennis> could you paste.ee the js
[08:52:04] <M|6> I'm using basic boostrap and calling the collapse using a simple doc ready collapse
[08:52:53] <M|6> Tennis: http://paste.ee/p/yH7L5
[08:53:39] <M|6> It's working in the sense that on click it collapses, but it should be collapsed on load and then expand on click.
[08:54:19] <Tennis> does it open back up when clicked again?
[08:54:25] <taplar> I believe you want collapse('hide')
[08:54:30] <taplar> from the docs
[08:55:07] <taplar> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse-methods
[08:55:15] <M|6> Tennis: Ya it opens back up on click, but it should be closed on page load. Yet for the life of me it wont do it
[08:55:58] <M|6> taplar: reading
[08:56:23] <taplar> i executed $('.collapse').collapse('hide'); in the console on that page and it closed them all
[08:56:47] <Tennis> so put that in the document.ready and you're good to go
[08:56:55] <Tennis> m|6 ^
[08:58:20] <M|6> taplar: ah! thanks buddy and you too Tennis
[08:58:34] <Tennis> :D
[08:59:28] <M|6> I think i've been looking at this for too long been working on this non stop for a day with netflix in the bg and i think my brain is melting
[08:59:45] <taplar> heh, that'll happen
[08:59:49] <M|6> i appreciate the help
[09:02:05] <M|6> Now to find a good way to reload on new mail
[09:03:16] <taplar> out of curiosity you plan on doing long polling or websockets?
[09:04:06] <isthisreallife> taplar i put alert in each
[09:04:25] <isthisreallife> and i get this alert when $('.responsive-calendar .pull-left div') is clicked
[09:05:04] <taplar> fiddle?
[09:12:38] <mh_> hi i have some problems with a solution to create and use a session on a remote server.. to build an shopping basket remotely.. it has to be crossdomain.. how can that be possible? there might be a way by create a sessionid on the clientside, and ship that with every request.. but that seems really bad.. are there any other way?
[09:14:25] <taplar> cross domain?
[09:15:46] <mh_> i have domain-a.com, where i want to execute some javascript which add a value to a session, which is located on domain-b.com.. and then i need to read that session on later requests..
[09:16:40] <taplar> you might be able to utilize the sessionStorage for that
[09:17:23] <Cork> mh_: you would have to make an ajax call to the remote server to create a session
[09:17:51] <taplar> yeah, that would be better
[09:17:53] <Cork> mh_: and the session has to be kept in js as basically all browsers will not support third party session cookies
[09:18:04] <Cork> + now days
[09:18:22] <Cork> mh_: a better option if possible is to have the two servers share there sessionstore
[09:18:30] <Cork> memcache is a good option for that
[09:19:01] <mh_> Cork: okay, but the server does not create a server on a cross domain javascript request.. seems like the only way it to make js create and keep the session id..?
[09:19:05] <Cork> you would still have to push the session in the data though
[09:19:16] <mh_> Cork: thats just not possible to have shared storage as memcache or anything else
[09:19:43] <Cork> mh_: well you will have to resort to quite a bit of hacks
[09:20:01] <Cork> cause like i said, the default for most browsers today is to not allow third party cookies
[09:20:18] <Cork> (unless the cookie already exist cause you visited the site)
[09:20:34] <mh_> Cork: yes.. so the only way is actually to make js create the session id, and tell php to use that session id, correct?
[09:20:48] <Cork> so you would have to login to domain1, redirect to domain2 to make a login there
[09:20:53] <mh_> Cork: the session does not exists, it needs to be the domain-a.com (external) page which is the initial request
[09:20:53] <Cork> and then redirect back to site 1
[09:21:05] <Cork> mh_: no not correct
[09:21:15] <Cork> mh_: you can't ever have js make the session
[09:21:25] <Cork> cause the session is to identify the client on the server
[09:21:34] <Cork> not to identify the server on the client ;)
[09:21:42] <taplar> server shouldn't trust the client that much
[09:21:55] <Cork> it isn't just about trust
[09:21:59] <Cork> it is about where the data is
[09:22:44] <mh_> Cork: but i cannot make the client make a request and get a session id as long its cross domain.. at least thats what i see in my test..
[09:23:01] <Cork> mh_: i just told you...
[09:23:11] <Cork> mh_: yes you can't make a js call you have to do a full page redirect
[09:23:19] <mh_> Cork: i've read people generate a sessionid on the client side, and then parse that to the server, which then create a session by that name.. but i can make it the other way.. make the server create an id, and then return that
[09:23:22] <Cork> else the browser will block the cookie
[09:23:27] <Cork> and you won't get the session id
[09:23:53] <Cork> mh_: having the client create the id makes no sense
[09:23:58] <Cork> as the data isn't in the id
[09:24:08] <Cork> the id is for the server to be able to locate it
[09:25:09] <isthisreallife> https://dpaste.de/YcH9#L44  if i remove line 44 then click on  $('.responsive-calendar .pull-left div') shows me calendar for previous month
[09:25:10] <davesidious> Hey folks - I'm using RequireJS to load jQuery and the slick-carousel plugin.  Everything appears to load correctly (first jQuery then Slick carousel), but when I attempt to use the .slick() method, it's undefined.
[09:25:23] <isthisreallife> it doesn't work when i call function before
[09:25:24] <isthisreallife> hmmm
[09:25:30] <isthisreallife> idk why
[09:25:32] <mh_> Cork: yes, it gives sence.. so i have to find a way to make the client and server know each other, there are no "standard" way, as far the client have never made a complete page request the page which generate the session
[09:25:58] <Cork> mh_: ... yes there are, i've told you the ways...
[09:26:03] <Cork> -_-'
[09:26:04] <mh_> Cork: thanks a lot.. for the thoughts :)
[09:26:07] <davesidious> Does anyone have any experience with issues like this?
[09:26:10] <mh_> oh..
[09:26:36] <Cork> the standard way (and the only fully supported way) is to do a full page redirect
[09:26:55] <Cork> any other way and you will lose the data on a page reload
[09:27:53] <Cork> basically, you want to avoid doing things cross domain if you ever have the option (different fqdns under the same domain is ok though)
[09:28:08] <Cork> cause browsers will really try to get in your way if you do
[09:28:19] <mh_> Cork: okay, well thats what i mean, but thats not possible in this setup.. i think of a way, the first page load on domain-a will make a request, server (domain-b) gives a key, domain-a keep that in a cookie.. then i can navigate around, and parse that on every page load.. and then find a way to store the data by that key
[09:28:25] <Cork> and they are planning to get much worse at it
[09:28:41] <isthisreallife> why can't i call function twice
[09:28:42] <isthisreallife> hmm
[09:28:42] <mh_> Cork: maybe i can ind a solution with some iframe.. 1x1 pixel
[09:29:00] <Cork> mh_: i wouldn't depend on that
[09:29:13] <mh_> Cork: the iframe solution, or shared key?
[09:29:14] <Cork> it sounds like something that won't be seen as a visit soon
[09:29:20] <Cork> the iframe
[09:29:36] <Cork> mh_: and you have no opton to just host them on the same domain?
[09:29:45] <Cork> like site1.doamin1.com site2.domain1.com ?
[09:30:09] <mh_> Cork: not really.. customers want to have their own domain names.. so i cannot create such solution
[09:30:20] <Cork> mh_: sure you can
[09:30:35] <Cork> just have multiple fqdn for the original page
[09:30:42] <Cork> one per customer
[09:32:35] <mh_> Cork: i dont see that as a solution, i cannot tell our customers they need to use site1.domain.com, they want to use their own.. and the page for the checkout is hosted on a fixed domain..
[09:32:56] <Cork> mh_: that isn't what i meant
[09:33:20] <Cork> you can set your server to allow what ever site name they want you on
[09:33:30] <Cork> and just virtual host those
[09:33:51] <Cork> then they can just add your servers ip/name as an a or name record
[09:34:20] <mh_> Cork: hmm.. that seems about right, i can use shared session between sub1.domain.com and sub2.domain.com?
[09:34:27] <Cork> yes
[09:34:41] <Cork> just set the cookie domain to be the second domain level
[09:37:22] <mh_> Cork: cool.. thanks a lot for the input.. i'll work on that solution.. thanks a lot :) but i would like to keep things under ssl, so there are some minor problems i have to find a solution for.. but that should be possible to fix, as long all the data are on the server..
[09:37:31] <rindolf> Hi all.
[09:37:54] <Cork> mh_: ya, you would have to get an ssl cert from them to get that to work
[09:38:11] <Cork> and if you want to host it all under one ip you would need sni
[09:38:20] <Cork> (that doesn't work in windows xp but... :) )
[09:41:10] <mh_> Cork: i know, so no matter what i do.. it will give problems.. but i think i might be able to host an insecure solution for the customer domain.. and when they are ready for checkout, i'll redirect to the ssl domain name.. but seems like the absolutely best solution..
[09:41:48] <Cork> mh_: as long as you don't send any login info overit, it sounds "workable"
[09:41:59] <Cork> --- as long as they aren't on public wifi :x
[09:42:15] <mh_> Cork: its only a matter of whats in a cart, no credentials or whatever :)
[09:42:16] <Cork> firesheap *woops*
[09:43:48] <mh_> Cork: :) yeah, it creazy easy to get credentials :/ so i'll remember that.. and properly work on a better solution with each domain has a certificate.. but for now this can work
[09:44:02] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/okzhy15y/1/ this thing blows up when the user has different number of images. how come?
[09:44:07] <Cork> ya
[09:45:34] <Cork> Kartagis: uh, cause you explicitly check if it has 2?
[09:46:16] <Cork> ah, no that is the keys...
[09:46:27] <Kartagis> Cork: if I don't, it blows up if the user has more than 1 image
[09:46:37] <Kartagis> I have no clue why
[09:47:13] <Cork> Kartagis: to start with i would recommend using if(k.nodes[0].node.field_fotograflar.src !== undefined) instead
[09:47:17] <Cork> it is a safer solution
[09:47:20] <Cork> and faster
[09:47:24] <Cork> and much less hacky :)
[09:48:04] <Cork> Kartagis: could you make an example where the data doesn't work?
[09:48:35] <Cork> anyway the different if case http://jsfiddle.net/okzhy15y/2/
[09:49:05] <Kartagis> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/okzhy15y/3/
[09:49:47] <Kartagis> wow
[09:49:59] <Kartagis> it works with all conditione
[09:50:06] <Cork> ya, you happen to have exactly 2
[09:50:07] <Kartagis> -e+s
[09:50:15] <Cork> so ["0", "1"] == src
[09:50:22] <Kartagis> Cork: I also had an else
[09:50:25] <Cork> not a good check i would say :)
[09:50:43] <decx> wouldn't it be safer to premap the sources out of that big object
[09:50:53] <Cork> ya, but Object.keys([{},{}]) == [0,1].length == 2
[09:51:02] <Cork> so your test breaks
[09:51:29] <Cork> decx: not really
[09:52:06] <Cork> opps i forgot to post the link
[09:52:22] <Cork> Kartagis: the change i proposed before fixed that http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/okzhy15y/3/
[09:52:40] <Kartagis> thanks :)
[09:52:55] <Cork> a more secure option would be to use $.isArray()
[09:53:06] <Cork> then you will only go into the first one if it isn't an array
[09:53:16] <Cork> but the check for .src should be safe enough
[10:08:50] <ph88^> how do i remove a css property on an element ?
[10:09:19] <ph88^> oh think i found it here http://stackoverflow.com/a/4036868/1833322
[10:12:19] <Cork> ph88^: just set it to ''
[10:12:28] <ph88^> roger that !
[10:55:33] <Xatenev> anybody familiar with google maps? it says the language is automatically adjusted on browser language but it isnt ._.
[11:02:07] <Es0teric> how do i move one div into another div in the dom?
[11:02:26] <Es0teric> do i just use appendTo() ?
[11:03:16] <Xatenev> Es0teric: yes
[11:03:35] <Xatenev> dependent on if you wanna add it to the beginning (prependTo) or the end (appendTo)
[11:06:59] <ph88^> Cork, i´m trying to use bootstrap and have a column that should appear ¨from the top¨ (start with height 0 and increase) this is my attempt https://jsfiddle.net/p47gzorm/ i don´t care what i´m doing wrong do you have any idea ?
[11:17:50] <ph88^> oh if i use show() instead of offsetheight it works ^^
[11:20:36] <HyP3r> I'm working with jquery and jquery mobile. I created a little fieldset with some inputs (radio).
[11:20:59] <HyP3r> jQuery automatically added some classes which is normally ok but in my acutal case not
[11:21:04] <HyP3r> Is there a way to disable this?
[11:23:45] <HyP3r> Meh the solution was data-role none …
[12:57:59] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I have a hidden <input>-field. I'm listening on this field with "onchange" event. Now the problem: In firefox, If I write the same value into <input>, the eventHandler still gets executed while with Chrome it doesn't get executed. How can I fix this?
[12:58:27] <robertmaxrees> i was just playing with that - i can confirm that's not the case.
[12:58:39] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: You're talking to me?
[12:58:43] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:58:49] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Which part is not the case?
[12:58:57] <tehopeologist> hey all i have an interesting situation i need to figure out
[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe the change handler doesn't fire.
[12:59:25] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hg78p8rL/
[12:59:27] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: With my chrome it only fires, if I write a different value
[12:59:33] <tehopeologist> i have a list of tags that get rendered by the server for something (eg: color, creative, etc)
[12:59:37] <robertmaxrees> right - same with firefox, JosefDe
[12:59:44] <tehopeologist> there could be 100 of these tags
[13:00:19] <tehopeologist> but our designers want to only show 2 lines of these tags, then put the rest in a tooltip with a tag that says +NUMBER_OF_EXTRA_TAGS
[13:00:32] <robertmaxrees> tehopeologist "tags" as in...
[13:00:37] <tehopeologist> words
[13:00:40] <tehopeologist> in a little bog
[13:00:41] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Ok, right. How can I fix this?
[13:00:41] <tehopeologist> *box
[13:00:42] <robertmaxrees> tehopeologist also, "lines" always makes me cringe.
[13:00:53] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: onblur won't work, as I write the value via Ajax
[13:00:55] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe ... there's nothing to fix.  FF and Chrome behave the same way.
[13:00:59] <tehopeologist> i mean in the sense of having two sets of tags
[13:01:21] <tehopeologist> robertmaxrees: like this:
[13:01:21] <tehopeologist> http://i.imgur.com/OMpdgFU.png
[13:01:23] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Right. But what I'm trying to achieve is, that as soon as a value get's written via jQuery into the <input> I want the event handler to be triggered
[13:01:54] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe don't do it that way :) fire the handler function directly instead.
[13:02:26] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Or I could write an empty string as reset value into the hidden field..
[13:02:39] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe nooooo
[13:02:39] <tehopeologist> so they only want two lines of tags, and if there's more than 2 lines worth of tags, they want to put the rest in a tooltip that looks like a tag that says something like "+5"
[13:02:48] <robertmaxrees> don't proxy logic through the DOM, JosefDe
[13:02:58] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Ok. The problem is this:
[13:03:21] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: The input is of type "file". How shall I then manually trigger the file-upload-event?
[13:03:23] <robertmaxrees> tehopeologist right, the issue is defining "2 lines" - you're going to have a hell of a time figuring that part out programmatically.
[13:03:32] <tehopeologist> yeah i know :'(
[13:03:34] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: I want to trigger it as soon as a file has been chosen
[13:03:48] <tehopeologist> especially since the tags are dynamic in their width based on the tag name
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe do you mean submit immediately?
[13:04:21] <tehopeologist> could i do something with the tag container's height?  since we always want 2 lines to be x height
[13:04:35] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: No. I'm only showing the filename..
[13:04:48] <tehopeologist> the issue i'm trying to figure out is how to figure out what tags are outside the container's height programmatically
[13:04:48] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe what is the "file-upload-event"?
[13:05:00] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: if a file has been chosen
[13:05:18] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe something here isn't clicking in my head.  can you make a fiddle or something?
[13:05:27] <JosefDe> sure
[13:05:41] <tehopeologist> i could just make the tags have a set width
[13:05:53] <tehopeologist> and if there's more than 6 put the rest in the +whatever tag
[13:05:54] <robertmaxrees> tehopeologist that won't display very well.
[13:06:05] <tehopeologist> what won't?
[13:06:10] <robertmaxrees> fixed width tags.
[13:06:13] <robertmaxrees> what happens when the text runs over?
[13:06:18] <tehopeologist> i could ellipsis them if they're long
[13:06:20] <tehopeologist> and tooltip them
[13:06:20] <robertmaxrees> an ellipsis?  because now the tags have no value.
[13:06:23] <tehopeologist> if they're long
[13:06:27] <tehopeologist> true
[13:06:32] <robertmaxrees> tags are supposed to be an "at-a-glance" thing.
[13:06:35] <tehopeologist> yeah
[13:06:39] <tehopeologist> hmm
[13:07:01] <tehopeologist> is there a way for js to see if elements are "outside" a container if i set a height requirement?
[13:07:03] <robertmaxrees> gonna have to get dirty with letter count + padding stuff.
[13:07:15] <robertmaxrees> tehopeologist not really - you're going to have to do some math ;)
[13:07:30] <tehopeologist> word, ok cool i'll figure it out, just wanted to make sure that was the only way :)
[13:07:32] <tehopeologist> thanks man!
[13:08:40] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: I have a perfect example which shows you that I'm right: http://jsfiddle.net/hg78p8rL/5/
[13:09:14] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: In Firefox, the change-event is triggered each time, even if you select the same file, while with Chrome it doesn't trigger the change-event-handler when selecting the same file
[13:09:29] <robertmaxrees> JosefDe that is distinct from your first problem description ;)
[13:09:41] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Ok. Then pardon me :)
[13:09:53] <JosefDe> But this is my actual problem
[13:09:55] <JosefDe> master
[13:10:05] <robertmaxrees> "master"?
[13:10:15] <JosefDe> Yeah. You're my master at the moment :)
[13:10:20] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:10:23] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of weird.
[13:10:24] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[13:10:38] <JosefDe> :D
[13:11:00] <JosefDe> Yeah. I'm a weird guy
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[13:12:54] <robertmaxrees> you could store the filename somewhere and check to see if it actually changed, or try some other way to detect if it's a different file.
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> but filename doesn't guarantee anything is actually different.
[13:13:29] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Yeah. But how would you do it then?
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you're doing with that event.
[13:14:26] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: I'm doing an immediate upload or I show the filename, depends on the mode
[13:14:54] <JosefDe> And what I'm trying to achieve is, that it triggers the change-event even if the chosen file has the same filename
[13:15:23] <robertmaxrees> so you want chrome to behave like firefox?
[13:15:50] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Why don't we just set the value of the file-input to empty string. This seems to be the only solution
[13:16:04] <robertmaxrees> because now you're working around a core browser behavior.
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to penalize users and make them use more bandwidth in a case where they probably don't need to?
[13:16:42] <robertmaxrees> if you're uploading immadiately anyway, why not reset the form after the upload has finished?
[13:16:58] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: Because in case the upload fails, the selected file is still stored in the file-input
[13:17:16] <robertmaxrees> then give them a "try again" button.
[13:17:19] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: And if upload works again, and he tries to re-upload the file by re-selecting the same file, no upload is shown or triggered
[13:17:25] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with resetting on a successful upload.
[13:18:18] <robertmaxrees> user successfuly uploads -> reset form.  upload fails -> give them a "retry" button.
[13:19:41] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: I can't do that as it's specified by my employee.
[13:19:51] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: I can't change specification
[13:19:58] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty terrible.
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> their UX is actively punishing users based on the browser they're using.
[13:20:17] <JosefDe> robertmaxrees: You're right but at the moment I have to find a solution for triggering the event each time..
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> feel free to do whatever then.
[13:20:48] <JosefDe> And I don't understand why you hate the idea, that I set the file-input to an empty string
[13:20:58] <robertmaxrees> it munges the logic.
[13:21:08] <JosefDe> Then suggest me an alternative
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[13:21:15] <robertmaxrees> but apparently that's unacceptable.
[13:21:18] <JosefDe> Yes
[13:21:19] <robertmaxrees> ;) see the problem.
[13:21:32] <robertmaxrees> so you're going to have to do the hack job.
[13:24:57] <jak2000> hi all
[13:29:26] <Robzilla> is there a jquery plugin that is similar to how Google drive sharing implements adding multiple users to a field?
[13:29:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:30:03] <Robzilla> e.g. typing a name/email and it will dropdown suggestions, but can also add multiple to a field, with an option to remove them
[13:30:04] <robertmaxrees> like in the "Share" dialog?
[13:30:08] <Robzilla> yeah
[13:30:49] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/2674466/923919
[13:30:51] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices.
[13:32:01] <Robzilla> robertmaxrees: perfect, thanks for the link
[13:32:18] <Robzilla> didn't know the best searchable term for it
[13:32:24] <jak2000> anyoen can try help me with ScrollTop? thanks
[13:32:25] <jak2000> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-scroll-on-a-div-scrolltop-and-offset-top-not-working-for-me
[13:32:54] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 $(".myScroll").scrollTop($("divRow_" + idxTar).offset.top); you're missing something there :)
[13:33:03] <robertmaxrees> in fact, 2 things.
[13:33:23] <jak2000> ahhh the # or the . right?
[13:33:29] <robertmaxrees> that's the first part.
[13:33:31] <robertmaxrees> also: http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[13:33:40] <jak2000> $(".myScroll").scrollTop($("#divRow_" + idxTar).offset.top); you're missing something there :)
[13:33:53] <lordjancso> hi, with jquery draggable how can i detect where i dragget item from?
[13:33:56] <robertmaxrees> now just fix your offset() use, jak2000
[13:34:03] <M|6> I'm looking for a proper way to delete files, what i currently have is $before = date('d-M-Y', strtotime('today')); but i'd like it precise to the second if possible.
[13:34:20] <robertmaxrees> M|6 "delete files" from where?'
[13:34:25] <jak2000> ok offset.top
[13:34:27] <jak2000> something
[13:34:27] <jak2000> ok
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 offset().top - it's a method.
[13:34:37] <M|6> robertmaxrees: its deleting emails
[13:34:54] <robertmaxrees> M|6 sounds like you want ##php
[13:35:09] <M|6> oh my bad
[13:35:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:35:26] <M|6> its been a long day :P thanks robertmaxrees
[13:36:17] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: $(".myScroll").scrollTop($("#divRow_" + idxTar).offset().top);
[13:36:25] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 something like that, yeah.
[13:36:56] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 are you trying to scroll to the bottom of the area?
[13:38:49] <jak2000> if you see, i have 28 inoput texts, and 28 rows (at the right) i want mantain visible the actual number of row (depending on i am (the number of the input)
[13:38:53] <jak2000> understand me?
[13:38:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.

[13:57:13] <omniarchos> hi all
[13:57:21] <omniarchos> could anyone help me?
[13:57:33] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos probably.
[13:57:49] <robertmaxrees> ask your question - if somebody can help, they will.
[13:58:53] <omniarchos> i am trying to build jquery ui from sources (master branch) but I do not find the .min.css file in dist folder. Am I doing something wrong? :/
[14:00:25] <omniarchos> I built it using "npm install && grunt" in local repo
[14:00:28] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:00:34] <omniarchos> np
[14:01:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing any build info for a minimized css file.
[14:01:52] <omniarchos> then I am missing something ^^
[14:02:01] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos huh?
[14:02:12] <omniarchos> how could I build css files for jquery ui?
[14:02:17] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos you are.
[14:02:28] <robertmaxrees> there's just no single .min.css
[14:02:36] <robertmaxrees> jquery-ui.css is it.
[14:02:48] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/4Lo9ftx6/
[14:02:52] <omniarchos> yes, sorry, I shorted it ^^'
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos you what
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:03:05] <jak2000> open the result pane, pls
[14:03:14] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 slow your roll broseph.
[14:03:24] <robertmaxrees> holy woah.
[14:03:28] <robertmaxrees> did you replicate your entire app in here?
[14:03:33] <jak2000> not
[14:03:36] <jak2000> only part
[14:03:41] <robertmaxrees> eitherwya, what's the deal?
[14:03:44] <jak2000> the 28 input ans the 28 divs
[14:04:15] <omniarchos> I gotta go, I'll be back later with more time to explain.
[14:04:24] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 problem statement, yo.
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> what do you need?
[14:04:37] <jak2000> ok, i explain you write some quantity n the first input, and exit to the second, i want move the scroll (Resumen Carga)
[14:04:51] <jak2000> to the second div and so on
[14:05:00] <robertmaxrees> looks like that part is working, right?
[14:05:06] <jak2000> aparently
[14:05:10] <jak2000> but in my app not
[14:05:14] <robertmaxrees> that's what you said earlier...
[14:05:21] <robertmaxrees> so it's not working - does it work in the fiddle?
[14:05:36] <jak2000> not to not work
[14:05:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:05:57] <omniarchos> i back
[14:06:01] <omniarchos> hi back
[14:06:05] <jak2000> not work too in the fiddle
[14:06:25] <omniarchos> I need help building jquery & ui from sources
[14:06:34] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos okay - what's the issue?
[14:07:13] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so it's the scoll that's not working correctly, right?
[14:07:13] <omniarchos> first, I have never been able to build jquery from a branch other than master, is it normal?
[14:07:26] <jak2000> yes not working correctly
[14:07:51] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos are you looking to contribute, or just build yourself?
[14:08:49] <omniarchos> \robertmaxrees for now, just build it would be enough. In time, maybe contributing
[14:09:06] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos so not all branches are forced to build properly last i checked.
[14:09:11] <robertmaxrees> master should always build properly.
[14:09:14] <robertmaxrees> but don't build master.
[14:09:19] <robertmaxrees> build the latest release.
[14:10:02] <omniarchos> robertmaxrees shouldn't the latest stable version (2.1-stable) be buildable?
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 http://api.jquery.com/offset/ - does the info in yellow apply to you?
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos yep.
[14:11:18] <omniarchos> robertmaxrees could not build it, I have errors from grunt when on that branch
[14:11:24] <robertmaxrees> what are the errors?
[14:11:49] <omniarchos> robertmaxrees I'm running it, will help to have it under the eyes
[14:11:59] <robertmaxrees> omniarchos also, try https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/2.1.1
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees> the tag, not the branch
[14:12:13] <laurentide> i am having trouble getting jquery slideDown to work on a css class. is this not correct?
[14:12:17] <laurentide> http://pastebin.com/cSfZ5fYc
[14:12:41] <robertmaxrees> laurentide that should work fine so long as the element is display: none; or height: 0;
[14:13:07] <laurentide> ohh ok i don't have the css properties, let me try that
[14:13:37] <laurentide> robertmaxrees, thank you!!
[14:13:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:17:08] <omniarchos> robertmaxrees running "npm i" I have a ENOENT error for "rename [repo]/node_modules/cli/node_modules/minimatch"
[14:18:15] <omniarchos> robertmaxrees I have a logfile but I don't know how to send it here :/
[14:19:46] <omniarchos> ah...my helper leaves me there... someone else is good at building jquery from sources?
[14:52:09] <lordjancso> i have a question with jquery sortable
[14:52:22] <lordjancso> i have connected sortable lists
[14:52:45] <lordjancso> and i want items to be droppen on a different list only if the element (cursor) is over that specific sorted list
[14:53:32] <lordjancso> by default if i start to drag an element from list one to list two, i move the cursor over list two, then drag out and release, the element will be dropped to list two
[14:53:59] <lordjancso> so i want my elements to be dropped only if the cursor is over that list
[14:54:03] <lordjancso> is this possible?
[15:25:38] <jak2000> 10 log (5) = 10 * Math.log(5) ?
[15:29:05] <spookah> I'm using the tablesorter plugin and $( document ).ready() fires before the pagerComplete event.  I'm a noob to this.. any advice would be really helpful.  I want to make sure the pagerComplete event finishes prior to $( document ).ready()

[16:46:34] <printForever> how to trasverse up the DOM?
[16:46:41] <printForever> .parent(4);
[16:46:48] <printForever> for 4 parents up
[16:48:26] <shoky> printForever: you probably want to add a class to the target parent element,  and use  .closest('.classnamehere')  instead of .parent..
[16:48:33] <printForever> I have
[16:48:36] <printForever> I just did that :)
[16:48:40] <shoky> awesome :)

[16:51:02] <NoiseEee> VectorX: the issue is not jquery ready not being 'fast' enough
[17:02:19] <lordjancso> somebody could help me with jquery sortable and draggable-droppable?
[17:02:40] <jphase> lordjancso: ask your question and if someone can help they will
[17:04:00] <lordjancso> jphase i have 2 sortable lists and list A is connectedWith list B. i want to drag and drop items from list A to list B but only append as last element
[17:04:14] <lordjancso> and i would like to use placeholder as well
[17:04:42] <lordjancso> so i dont know how to allow to drop items only as last element and show placeholder only as last element
[17:06:25] <jphase> lordjancso: well you're going to want to use the drop event that jQuery UI has in .droppable() - have you reviewed the API docs?
[17:06:31] <jphase> http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable/#event-drop
[17:07:25] <jphase> I don't know the exact code you'll have to write but I can help you find out if you setup a jsfiddle that shows what you're trying to do
[17:07:29] <lordjancso> jphase yes, i red all api docs (sortable, draggable, droppable), but i still dont know how to display placeholder as last element
[17:07:38] <jphase> (I'd have to debug the output to know)
[17:08:02] <jphase> try setting up a jsfiddle and link that here when you're done and we'll start from there
[17:16:15] <lordjancso> jphase http://jsfiddle.net/UAcC7/1689/
[17:16:23] <lordjancso> there are two lists
[17:16:40] <lordjancso> both sortable and list A connected to list B so you can drag and drop items from A to B
[17:17:06] <lordjancso> now i want to allow only to drop to B as last element
[17:17:14] <lordjancso> and display placeholder there
[17:18:14] <lordjancso> jphase so if you drag and element from list A over list B, the placeholder should display as last element of B and if you release mouse, item should be dropped as last element (where the placeholder is)
[17:20:52] <hapi_> c
[17:22:34] <jphase> lordjancso: give me a sec
[17:22:42] <lordjancso> jphase sure
[17:22:43] <lordjancso> thank you
[17:49:11] <jphase> lordjancso: I see some working examples with draggable and droppable but not with sortable
[17:49:28] <jphase> in theory it should be the same, but it's not working the same :\
[17:53:15] <lordjancso> jphase is there any placeholder function in draggable and droppable?
[17:53:25] <lordjancso> because i can not find any
[17:53:38] <jphase> not sure what you mean by placeholder, but I doubt it
[17:54:27] <lordjancso> sortable have a placeholder option
[17:54:36] <lordjancso> which shows you where you will drop your element
[17:54:59] <lordjancso> i've tried to show you in my example
[17:55:38] <jphase> well sure, that applies a class to the dragged item
[17:57:42] <lordjancso> jphase so but how can i setup these option for a draggable?
[17:59:46] <jphase> lordjancso: you're thinking about it wrong - you set it up on droppable
[17:59:59] <jphase> well, I would go that route anyway
[18:00:03] <lordjancso> jphase yes, then how can i setup on droppable?
[18:00:37] <jphase> I'm still trying to figure that out for you - I can target the element being dropped, and its parent, but it's a bit tricky to figure out how to detach on sortable lists
[18:00:38] <jphase> sec
[18:02:06] <lordjancso> thank you
[18:08:12] <jphase> lordjancso: I can't figure out a way to do this with sortable connected lists and a droppable drop event from jQuery UI - it's close but not quite:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/UAcC7/1690/
[18:08:40] <jphase> so you can try to go that route to get that working if you want, but some people are using draggable with droppable instead of the connected lists with sortable
[18:08:48] <jphase> i.e. http://jsfiddle.net/mgibsonbr/PtLLf/ does what you want
[18:08:58] <jphase> but should probably be tweaked a litt
[18:09:11] <jphase> little* - if I wasn't done with work I'd try to help more but I gotta jet :(
[18:18:38] <lordjancso> jphase thank you!
[18:18:54] <lordjancso> jphase i have another question, i hope its more simple
[18:19:42] <lordjancso> jphase with sortable, if you have 2 connected list, list a and list b, then you start to drag an element from list a to list b, you over the cursor to list b, but dont release
[18:19:52] <lordjancso> then move out the cursor from list b (still dont release)
[18:20:31] <lordjancso> then when if you will release the mouse button (stop dragging) then you will move your element to list B, but your cursor is not over it
[18:20:47] <lordjancso> so i want to allow to drop items to lists only if the cursor is over that specific list
[18:20:57] <lordjancso> jphase is this possible with sortable?
[18:34:33] <oompahlumpa> Hello, have a quick jquery question I am hoping someone can help me solve
[18:34:59] <robertmaxrees> oompahlumpa ask it - if somebody can help, they will
[18:35:07] <jak2000> robertmaxrees :(
[18:35:17] <robertmaxrees> what?
[18:35:33] <jak2000> cant cant,, with scrolltop
[18:35:45] <robertmaxrees> "cant cant"?
[18:35:55] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 i feel like maybe you're overcomplicating your problem.
[18:36:10] <oompahlumpa> how would I activate this css .videoPostDescription h2:hover:after { width: 100%; background: #161616; } within a $(this).hover(function () { });  ???
[18:36:45] <robertmaxrees> oompahlumpa you can't really.
[18:36:54] <robertmaxrees> like, it should apply already.
[18:37:02] <oompahlumpa> it does..
[18:37:12] <oompahlumpa> but the problem is I want it to activate when I hover the container
[18:37:26] <robertmaxrees> then add a container hover psuedo.
[18:37:43] <oompahlumpa> example?
[18:37:49] <robertmaxrees> .videoPostDescription:hover h2:after, .videoPostDescription h2:hover:after
[18:38:06] <oompahlumpa> let me give that a try
[18:39:39] <robertmaxrees> although then you could just kill the second half of that selector.
[18:40:27] <oompahlumpa> @robertmaxrees you absolutely rock!
[18:40:34] <oompahlumpa> Thank you so much sir!
[18:40:42] <robertmaxrees> you actually just need .videoPostDescription:hover h2:after
[18:40:46] <robertmaxrees> but get the idea?
[18:41:05] <oompahlumpa> ya ya I got it to work again much thanks!
[18:41:15] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
