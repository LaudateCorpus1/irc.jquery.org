[00:54:53] <arthurvr> Hey guys! What’s up today?
[01:01:46] <ussher_> I have a script on a web paget that is loaded in a modal window from another website like this <script src="http://www.emailmeform.com/....." type="text/javascript"></script> then is showin in the modal window by un-hiding it.  Is there a way to call that script when the modal is un-hidden instead of when every page is loaded.  tried getScript but cross site blocks it.
[01:02:50] <ussher_> also tried putting it in a page by itself and using .load() but that didnt work either.
[02:41:43] <marduk1984> Have a click event on a <i> which works fine, but when i click fast, then it will highlight stuff at the page. how come?

[04:47:43] <Biganon> woohoo finally found a plugin that swaps 2 elements and doesn't mess with the select lists or the datetimepickers
[04:48:02] <Biganon> https://github.com/tejanium/jquery.swap for anyone interested
[04:48:18] <Biganon> even has an animation, though somewhat buggy
[04:53:00] <Biganon> I don't even know how it does that
[04:53:20] <Biganon> the clone() are not even clone(true)
[05:36:46] <pythys> Hi everyone. How can I map mouseout event to apply to a set of elements and not just one (the mouse should leave the entire menu for example)
[06:13:28] <AlluringMe> I can't understand this strange behaviour for click event http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/9/
[06:13:35] <AlluringMe> Please help, thanks.
[06:15:21] * AlluringMe sighs**
[06:19:54] <Uhkis> AlluringMe: we can't help if you don't tell what's the strange behaviour in your opinion
[06:20:11] <AlluringMe> Lol hi
[06:20:36] <AlluringMe> The first time I click it displays the div value
[06:20:47] <AlluringMe> second time it fetches a wrong value
[06:21:30] <AlluringMe> If user clicks on 3 the textarea sould say 1 all the time
[06:21:37] <AlluringMe> sould say 3*
[06:21:52] <Uhkis> if you append 3 to 3, it's 33
[06:22:10] <AlluringMe> I see what you mean
[06:22:16] <AlluringMe> I must change the method
[06:22:42] <AlluringMe> I will try a different method. Thanks. :)
[06:23:25] <Uhkis> after() might be what you're looking for
[06:23:40] <henk1> hello
[06:25:32] <AlluringMe> I need it in the same div
[06:25:51] <AlluringMe> I think after will append it after the element?
[06:26:00] <AlluringMe> add*
[06:35:07] <AlluringMe> I don't see any other methods that can add a textarea within a div
[06:35:24] <AlluringMe> I am seeing DOM manipulation documentation
[06:35:36] <AlluringMe> http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-inside/
[06:35:57] <hlidutysileh> did usa covertly supply isis with weapons like they did with al-qaeda to justify creating wars?
[06:35:57] <hlidutysileh> did usa excute the creative mess in the middle east like they said they will, does the creative mess include explosion with uncertain responsibles to create wars?
[06:35:57] <hlidutysileh> plz, send my qs to help limiting usa&israel aggression against others in the middle east.

[06:36:01] <AlluringMe> Uhkis, any possible solutions please?
[06:41:25] <AlluringMe> I need the textarea inside DIV: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/10/
[06:41:38] <AlluringMe> If I append it is pain in butt lol
[06:42:45] <AlluringMe> I'd used a modal earlier, but modal content is not editable. The only thing I can think of is create something like a modal using custom code
[06:42:53] <AlluringMe> Any other alternatives?
[06:47:19] <AlluringMe> Something like this will help achieve the purpose
[06:47:20] <AlluringMe> http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/demo-bs3.html
[06:47:29] <AlluringMe> on click load something like this
[06:47:45] <AlluringMe> then edit's to be appended in divs
[06:57:56] <henk1> do you need to know javascript very well before learning jquery?
[06:58:39] <g00glen00b> jQuery is just a library to make certain things in javascript easier
[06:59:11] <g00glen00b> so yes, you should know things in javascript
[06:59:32] <AlluringMe> g00glen00b, any thoughts on my question please; i see an active person YAY!!!! :D
[07:00:15] * AlluringMe dances!
[07:00:16] <henk1> g00glen00b i started learning javascript some time ago but was overwhelmed with theory and got quickly bored. jquery seems to have a more practical approach
[07:00:41] <g00glen00b> henk, you don't need to know all theory stuff, but you can't write applications entirely in jQuery
[07:00:50] <g00glen00b> jQuery isn't a language
[07:00:52] <g00glen00b> it's a library
[07:01:01] <g00glen00b> so when you use jQuery you're also going to use javascript
[07:01:34] <g00glen00b> but if you know the javascript basics it will be pretty much enough
[07:01:57] <henk1> okay that's what i wanted to hear
[07:02:09] <g00glen00b> AlluringMe, you want to put the textarea inside the [1] [2] [3] squares in stead of below?
[07:02:25] <AlluringMe> Yes, right but append() has issues
[07:02:41] <AlluringMe> it fetches old vals + add new val
[07:03:14] <AlluringMe> http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/10/
[07:03:37] <AlluringMe> If you cllick you'd know my issue.
[07:03:51] <g00glen00b> I see that it adds it after the square, yes
[07:04:02] <g00glen00b> but you're using after(), what issues do you have with append()?
[07:04:09] <g00glen00b> maybe we have to solve those in stead :p
[07:04:16] <AlluringMe> sec, I will show. :)
[07:04:17] <AlluringMe> lol
[07:04:29] <AlluringMe> http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/11/
[07:04:32] <AlluringMe> Please check now
[07:04:41] <AlluringMe> 1st click is fine. I get what I want
[07:04:59] <AlluringMe> for second click it fetches old values :'(
[07:05:12] <AlluringMe> 1st - Edit text for : 1
[07:05:28] <AlluringMe> 2nd- Edit text for : 1Edit text for : 1
[07:05:29] <g00glen00b> yeah, when you click the textarea you're also clicking the div again indirectly
[07:05:35] <g00glen00b> so it adds another one
[07:05:43] <g00glen00b> but you don't need the second textarea I assume?
[07:05:45] <AlluringMe> Is there a way to prevent that?
[07:05:48] <cjohnson> and also you're appending
[07:05:55] <cjohnson> you can e.stopPropogation
[07:05:58] <cjohnson> to stop it bubbling up to the div
[07:06:02] <AlluringMe> Yes, I want something like an append
[07:06:16] <AlluringMe> Okay let me try that.
[07:06:17] <cjohnson> well the text is doubling up when you append. if that's intentional then yeah you want append
[07:06:18] <g00glen00b> indeed
[07:06:39] <AlluringMe> Yes, its doubling
[07:06:52] <cjohnson> oh I always spell that wrong. it's event.stopPropagation();  in your case
[07:06:54] <g00glen00b> to me it looks like you don't want the second textarea, but only one if there isn't one yet
[07:06:55] <AlluringMe> For second click I want it to say Edit text for : 1a or something like that
[07:07:02] <g00glen00b> ah
[07:07:48] <AlluringMe> event.stopPropagation(); or e.stopPropogation are same I think?
[07:07:50] <AlluringMe> are they?
[07:07:56] <g00glen00b> I recommend adding the "1" to a seperate element (a <span>) and then request the text of that element
[07:07:58] <cjohnson> actually you would have to put that stop in the textarea onclick handler which you don't have defined yet. Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/12/
[07:08:00] <AlluringMe> one is with a cus handler and other is without
[07:08:01] <g00glen00b> it's stopPropagation()I think
[07:08:15] <cjohnson> it would be event in your case AlluringMe because your function signature has "event"
[07:08:21] <cjohnson> I usually just use "e" in mine
[07:09:11] <AlluringMe> I understand. Thank you cjohnson, and g00glen00b I will look at the changes and brb
[07:09:12] <AlluringMe> lol
[07:09:14] <AlluringMe> :D
[07:09:49] <cjohnson> you understand how that's working?
[07:10:04] <AlluringMe> Hmm, this still does not help
[07:10:25] <cjohnson> well that was just to get it to stop adding a new textarea when you click on the textarea
[07:10:27] <AlluringMe> When I click it duplicates the text again
[07:10:44] <g00glen00b> http://jsfiddle.net/8dxpd94h/
[07:10:52] <AlluringMe> Okay, I must look at the code again then, sec
[07:11:06] <cjohnson> AlluringMe: when you do $(this).text() on the div, it reads all the text content out of that div, including whatever is in the textarea
[07:11:08] <g00glen00b> you can add an event handler to the text area, and make it stop bubbling the event
[07:11:08] <AlluringMe> Yes, yes, one issue solved. :D
[07:11:12] <g00glen00b> indeed
[07:11:28] <g00glen00b> that's why you should put the text you need to a seperate element, maybe a <span>
[07:11:36] <cjohnson> or don't use $(this).text()
[07:11:43] <g00glen00b> true :p
[07:11:43] <cjohnson> to read the data
[07:11:54] <AlluringMe> I will try to do that too haha
[07:12:00] <AlluringMe> I am new go easy on me lol
[07:12:21] <cjohnson> oh I see. yeah the span makes more sense
[07:12:36] <cjohnson> though I would go with this for the event propagation code: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/12/
[07:12:39] <g00glen00b> the text() converts all text inside the div to a single string, so in your case it keeps recursing on all text areas as well and you end up with duplicate text ;)
[07:12:44] <cjohnson> that way you aren't defining a new event handler each time
[07:12:48] <AlluringMe> Both of your codes did something sexy LOL
[07:12:56] <AlluringMe> I must learn em now
[07:13:02] <g00glen00b> true cjohnson
[07:13:06] <AlluringMe> and understand. This is something I needed.
[07:13:51] <AlluringMe> Thank you very much again . I will understand code, clean CSS and see help. cjohnson, g00glen00b
[07:14:04] <cjohnson> np
[07:14:05] <AlluringMe> seek* help again
[07:14:05] <g00glen00b> np
[07:14:08] <AlluringMe> :D
[07:16:13] <dylmye_gh> Hi! Could someone help with this please? > https://github.com/dylmye/dashradio-min-client/issues/1
[07:16:55] <cjohnson> doesn't look like a jquery issue?
[07:34:14] <atomicB0mb> Hi, does anyone know a plugin for the "Serviços" content? joyncorp.com/homologacao
[07:34:30] <atomicB0mb> i would like to select a green circle, and the text slides horzontally
[07:34:50] <atomicB0mb> or just nav between those "<"
[07:34:55] <atomicB0mb> ">" arrows
[07:35:19] <cjohnson> that's called a carousel or gallery sometimes
[07:35:29] <cjohnson> generally they're bad interfaces
[07:36:00] <cjohnson> http://www.velir.com/blog/index.php/2014/04/18/why-you-shouldnt-use-a-carousel-to-feature-content/
[07:36:09] <atomicB0mb> humm
[07:36:18] <atomicB0mb> so u are saying for me not to use a plugin on that?
[07:36:59] <cjohnson> I would say that the interface itself is not good. it's shown that people almost never read any slide except the first
[07:37:12] <cjohnson> just list the content out or link to another page that explains it in detail
[07:37:19] <cjohnson> if you're hell-bent still, google for "carousel" there's a million plugins to do it
[07:38:19] <atomicB0mb> yeah, i got what u are saying, UX. The thing is that im not the designer of it=( only a developer, i cant change what they wanted
[07:38:26] <atomicB0mb> but thank you tho =)
[07:38:41] <cjohnson> yeah it happens. perhaps pass that article along back to the designer
[07:38:58] <atomicB0mb> all the carousel i see its about images sliders only
[07:39:00] <atomicB0mb> sure i will
[07:39:53] <GreatDanton> cjohnson, thanks for that link
[07:40:17] <GreatDanton> I was thinking about implementing such carousel but now I totally agree
[07:40:27] <atomicB0mb> i think im just gonna create it by myself
[07:41:04] <cjohnson> there's definitely more than just image sliders. I guarantee it. you'd be reinventing the wheel for the millionth time if you write it yourself :P
[07:41:38] <cjohnson> here's one that does any content http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightslider/
[07:42:55] <atomicB0mb> humm, nice one
[07:42:58] <atomicB0mb> thanks cjohnson
[08:05:13] <temhaa> hello
[08:05:21] <temhaa> I am using jquery. and regex
[08:05:45] <sc_> as am i
[08:07:23] <temhaa> my string is : "hodo  <##PARAM4##> hede  <##PARAM1##><##PARAM3##><##PARAM4##> hedehedeh  <##PARAM1##>'hede hodo <##PARAM2##><##PARAM2##> bla  bla bla"
[08:07:49] <temhaa> I want replace <##PARAM..##> to empty string ('')
[08:08:08] <temhaa> I tried: string.replace(/\s<##([^##>]+?)##>/g, '');
[08:08:18] <temhaa> but my output is: "hodo hede<##PARAM3##><##PARAM4##> hedehedeh'hede hodo<##PARAM2##> bla bla bla"
[08:08:52] <temhaa> if I use as string: "hodo  <##PARAM4##> hede <##PARAM1##> <##PARAM3##>  <##PARAM4##> hedehedeh <##PARAM1##>'hede hodo  <##PARAM2##> <##PARAM2##> bla bla bla"
[08:09:04] <temhaa> Its work fine. : output: "hodo hede hedehedeh'hede hodo bla bla bla"
[08:09:20] <temhaa> How can I solve that problem
[08:17:11] <cjohnson> temhaa: http://jsfiddle.net/7joLLnp3/
[08:17:39] <cjohnson> actually you don't need to escape the < > like I did. I just wanted to be sure
[08:17:50] <cjohnson> /<##PARAM\d+##>/g  works fine
[08:18:54] <cjohnson> your expression above is mistaking some things. when you do [^X] it matches any character that isn't X. when you do [^XY] it matches any character except X or Y
[08:19:13] <cjohnson> so yours is saying "any character except # or >" not necessarily "up until ##>"
[08:19:24] <cjohnson> for that you would need a negative lookahead I think. but that's overkill
[08:20:16] <cjohnson> so actually it does work but just not the way you're thinking. the only reason it doesn't match is because you have \s at the beginning ;)
[08:20:34] <cjohnson> and some of those params don't have spaces before them
[08:20:36] <temhaa> cjohnson: I removed \s so Its works thanks
[08:20:52] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/7joLLnp3/1/
[08:21:28] <cjohnson> you can make the space optional like this  temhaa
[09:18:36] <sc_> anyone know why my json object contains two functions at the end, with the keys "shuffle:" and "remove:"
[09:18:45] <sc_> it seems they cannot be removed?
[09:24:34] <sacho> your json object?
[09:25:51] <dave_34> i'm trying to alert in js when a new class is added to an html element, but it doesn't seems to working any ideas on it ?
[09:27:49] <sacho> code?
[09:28:01] <MrStar> uhm do you have control over when a new class is added or removed? if so, you could trigger a custom event etc.
[09:29:34] <dave_34> var form = jQuery('form.wpcf7-form');
[09:29:34] <dave_34>     if(form.hasClass('.sent'))
[09:29:34] <dave_34>     {
[09:29:34] <dave_34>       alert('success');
[09:29:34] <dave_34>     }
[09:30:13] <dave_34> form is submitted via ajax, once the form is submitted, sent class get added to form element
[09:30:35] <MrStar> right o.o and then?
[09:31:06] <dave_34> alert doesn't show up ?
[09:31:19] <MrStar> hm shouldn't it be "hasClass('sent')?
[09:31:26] <MrStar> not .sent
[09:32:43] <dave_34> oops yeah it should be let me try with that
[09:34:14] <dave_34> doesn't make any effect yet
[09:34:41] <AoiC> okay - did you check using firebug or something, that the class actually gets added?
[09:35:29] <AoiC> you could make a breakpoint and see whether the form-selector returns any valid element and whether that element has actually the css class "sent" set
[09:36:00] <AoiC> it'd be a lot easier though if I had a jsfiddle to test it with D:
[09:36:34] <dave_34> yup i've checked wana take a look at url
[09:36:55] <sacho> dave_34, use a paste service when pasting code(e.g. see the topic)
[09:37:21] <sacho> dave_34, you didn't paste any timing code - are you listening for some event? are you doing this on a timeout? when does it happen?
[09:37:41] <AoiC> no I suppose he adds a class to some element once a form is submitted
[09:38:02] <AoiC> and then at some point he checks whether some element has that css class to it..
[09:38:19] <AoiC> jQuery('form.wpcf7-form'); <- looks weird as there is neither a dot for selecting a class nor a # symbol to select by id
[09:38:52] <AoiC> so I suppose the selector does not return any element and thus checking it won't yield that form variable having the desired css class
[09:39:19] <dave_34> i'm sharing the url here it is http://bloghardy.com/2015/03/solvemedia-captcha-test/ , you see a captcha on this it's inside a form element, type in anything in the captcha for now, and then form will be submitted, as the form is submitted i wanted to show alert or perform something else
[09:39:20] <AoiC> then again I'm working on assumptions here T_T and that's not smart of me .. brb smoke :x
[09:42:56] <sacho> AoiC, form.wpcf7-form matches form elements with the "wpcf7-form" class.
[09:42:56] <AoiC> dave - check whether your selector (in your example the "form" variable) actually returns a valid result
[09:43:20] <AoiC> ah .. totally forgot about regular html elements T_T
[09:43:47] * AoiC will be back in a few
[09:45:31] <dave_34> any thought what it can be
[09:48:08] <shoky> dave_34: you need to check if it has the class, only after it actually has the class. currently your check is running right away on page load, before the form is even submitted
[09:49:06] <skypce> hello guys, do you can help me to fix my last carousel in desktop view? http://108.250.221.197:8082/ i am using flexslider , but the problem it is not work continuosLoop
[09:50:30] <skypce> i am using flexslider
[09:52:03] <edu> Hi everyone, I need help with this little slice of code -> http://jsbin.com/yibepa/1/edit?js
[09:53:12] <edu> I have spent too much time with it :(
[09:53:38] <shoky> edu: .add doesn't mutate the jquery collection. you need to do:  jqobj = jqobj.add(something);
[09:54:14] <edu> thanks a lot shoky, I'll try it ;)
[09:57:17] <edu> what I can't figure out is why '$newCard' is 'undefined' -> http://jsbin.com/yibepa/1/edit?js
[09:58:30] <edu> even doing this -> var $newCard = $('<img>); // undefined
[10:03:55] <skypce> how can i fix a flexslider carousel for animationLoop works?
[10:07:19] <dave_34> shoky it's still not showing up
[10:08:01] <ThePendulum> It seems like .which on keydown() only returns 0s for mobile input, except for enter which does return 13. Any workarounds or solutions for this?
[10:08:30] <ThePendulum> I guess I could check the last character of the text field that's being written to
[10:09:01] <ThePendulum> although that probably doesn't really work for backspace, nevermind that :/
[10:12:19] <TheDavidFactor> I think I found a bug in jQuery animate, and the webpage recommends coming here before posting a bug report. It only happens in FireFox so I thought it might be a FireFox bug, but it didn't start happening until after jQuery 1.7.2 so that makes me think it's a jQuery bug. I have a jsfiddle that demonstrates the issue.
[10:12:59] <ThePendulum> Are you interested in explaining the bug? :D
[10:13:11] <TheDavidFactor> Typing now :-D
[10:14:00] <TheDavidFactor> I'm trying to "zoom" an absolutely positioned div out from the center of the page by using top, right, bottom, left percentages from 50% to 10%. fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/3mmbz3ko/2/
[10:15:26] <ThePendulum> different actions in FF and Chrome indeed, although the end result is the same
[10:15:35] <ThePendulum> the FF animation seems to drag the dot to the top left before expanding the box
[10:15:46] <ThePendulum> while the Chrome animation keeps it centered
[10:15:56] <TheDavidFactor> I've tested in chrome, IE, FireFox, Safari mobile and chrome mobile and only FireFox exhibits the issue: for about the first half of the animate the div moves left and up without growing. and then grows to full size from the new starting point.
[10:16:24] <TheDavidFactor> If you change the framework to 1.7.2 in the fiddle, it will grow from the center in FF
[10:16:25] <ThePendulum> yeah
[10:16:30] <ThePendulum> let me see
[10:17:04] <ThePendulum> did you find this bug through your own experimentation or on jsfiddle? perhaps it's isolated to jsfiddle
[10:17:39] <ThePendulum> after 1.7.2 for me too indeed
[10:18:18] <TheDavidFactor> I was trying to do it on a site I was developing and noticed the odd behavior so I started searching. I found this which seemed to be related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25214315/jquery-animate-not-properly-calculating-position-when-using-percent-in-firefox
[10:18:42] <TheDavidFactor> But it was slightly different, so I created my own fiddle
[10:19:03] <ThePendulum> It's suggested to be a Chrome issue that accidentally does what one would expect, but Firefox does the same with earlier versions of jQ as well indeed
[10:19:39] <ThePendulum> not sure if #jquery-dev might have more answers
[10:20:02] <TheDavidFactor> I mentioned it works as expected in IE, Chrome & Safari mobile
[10:20:19] <TheDavidFactor> I'll jump over there and ask
[10:20:30] <ThePendulum> all I can say is that the issue exists for me as well on FF 36.0.1 and Chrome 41.0.02272.89 on Ubuntu 14.04
[10:21:00] <ThePendulum> but whether it's a FF or a jQ bug, I'm not sure
[10:21:37] <ThePendulum> I'm not sure what about the animation changed since 1.7.2
[10:21:46] <TheDavidFactor> Thanks
[10:22:31] <arthurvr> Hey-hey all!
[10:22:36] <ThePendulum> 'lo happy one
[10:37:21] <dave_304> i'm trying to connect two different world not sure even if it's possible or not but would like to know so i plan to use google map api application, and revolution tool by securefreedom which contain list of representatives, now what i'm trying is, everytime a new representative register on other site/tool it should add a new store item on google ma
[10:37:21] <dave_304> p api application, both the application are not connected in any way, just revolution offer their own api
[10:51:26] <jeffmjack> any ideas on why text() doesn't seem to be working here? http://jsfiddle.net/jeffmjack/1skzqv3d/
[10:57:20] <sc_> i have no idea why shuffle: and remove: are being added to all of my arrays?
[10:58:44] <AoiC> jeffmjack - apparently your $(this).closest('.name-col') is not found ..
[10:59:57] <AoiC> the reason it might not find name-col is that closest traverses the DOM tree upwards
[11:00:21] <AoiC> but name-col is a sibling to the input's parent table cell
[11:01:08] <jeffmjack> hm
[11:01:14] <jeffmjack> it's actually an uncle, right?
[11:01:23] <AoiC> ..hehe :D
[11:01:23] <jeffmjack> the input's parent cell is a td
[11:01:48] <jeffmjack> yeah that's weird
[11:02:04] <jeffmjack> I ran a different test with ul's and li's
[11:02:16] <AoiC> http://jsfiddle.net/1skzqv3d/1/ this works
[11:02:19] <jeffmjack> and the sibling ul (the uncle :P ) was found
[11:02:40] <jeffmjack> oh, awesome
[11:02:43] <jeffmjack> :D :D
[11:02:59] <AoiC> though perhaps you might select not just input[type=checkbox], but td>input[type=checkbox] (not sure if it will work)
[11:03:08] <AoiC> that way you might be able to avoid using .parent()
[11:03:26] <jeffmjack> ah right
[11:03:36] <jeffmjack> good to think about that approach
[11:04:00] <AoiC> ah hm actually it does not work, because it selects the last element it seems
[11:04:46] <AoiC> I read somewhere about using $ on a css selector to stress, which element you actually want to apply a style to .. but from what I know it does not work in most if not all browsers
[11:06:27] <jeffmjack> hm
[11:08:12] <AoiC> hm yeah so for now that jsfiddle is the best approach I could come up with ^^.. it also depends whether you know that the checkbox will definitely be directly within a table-cell or not.. because if for some reason you are unsure (because e.g. page gets generated), you might want to try being more precise instead of using .parent()
[11:08:58] <AoiC> http://jsfiddle.net/1skzqv3d/2/ like this
[11:10:42] <AoiC> oh and you might want to use "parents" method instead of "parent", because the latter only traverses a single level while the former searches all levels I believe
[11:17:53] <jeffmjack> cool
[11:18:23] <jeffmjack> and you're passing the selector in to parents just to make sure that it stops at the right level before looking for siblings?
[11:18:35] <R13ose> If I want to fade in and out background images very slowly (this goes from 100% to 80% to 60% etc) as I scroll, how do I do that?
[11:19:13] <AoiC> yeah @jeffmjack - I would use .parents('attend-col') to ensure it traverses enough parents to stop at the one with this exact class
[11:19:39] <jeffmjack> cool... thanks AoiC !!
[11:19:43] <AoiC> you should do that however only if you are not sure of your hierarchy relative to the input element
[11:19:54] <AoiC> np :)
[11:22:31] <R13ose> Code: http://pastebin.com/GGNYN2aV  The fadeInBlock works for another part of the site but I don't know how to create a fadeOutBlock and the  bottom code was a bad attempt at making this work.
[11:24:57] <AoiC> not to sound mean, but could you make a jsfiddle out of that? that way it's easier to experiment and try-out a thought or two
[11:25:19] <jeffmjack> if you have $('.some-elements'), what's the easiest way to iterate over them?
[11:25:29] <jeffmjack> it doesn't seem like that's how each() works
[11:25:43] <AoiC> $('.some-elements').each(function(index, element) {...});
[11:25:51] <jeffmjack> hm ok
[11:26:09] <jeffmjack> the only syntax is was seeing in the docs was each(array/obj, callback)
[11:26:19] <AoiC> hm let me check
[11:26:25] <jeffmjack> er, $.each(array/obj, callback)
[11:27:03] <AoiC> that one is a jquery each
[11:27:41] <sacho> jeffmjack, there's .each() and jQuery.each() - you can find both in the documentation
[11:27:41] <AoiC> this one you can use on any selector you make .. just .each(callback(index, element)) I believe..
[11:28:03] <jeffmjack> cool, ok that makes sense
[11:28:21] <AoiC> yeah - however you can also use $(this), jeffmjack
[11:28:35] <AoiC> you do not have to use $(element)
[11:28:48] <AoiC> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:31:11] <R13ose> any thoughts on my question?
[11:31:57] <AoiC> How am I supposed to try it out if I do not have a html/css, but only the javascript :x?
[11:36:35] <R13ose> AoiC: do you want me to send you the dropbox link?
[11:38:27] <AoiC> I suppose I could have a look at it, but I cannot guarantee I will be able to fix it.
[11:38:56] <R13ose> AoiC: n worries.
[11:40:35] <R13ose> AoiC: what I want is in the first section to go from blue water to brown dry ground that can't grow anything.  I want the opacity to slowly fade out on the image and fade in on the next image.  If that makes sense.
[11:41:40] <AoiC> only one way? or both ways? what about the white block? does it have to go with the scroll or just with a certain timeout?
[11:42:05] <R13ose> AoiC: both ways.  You mean the white text?
[11:42:17] <AoiC> the white block under the first image
[11:43:17] <R13ose> AoiC: I don't see that, can you show me what you mean?
[11:44:39] <AoiC> http://abload.de/img/temp_white_blockddukm.jpg
[11:45:19] <R13ose> AoiC: what is under the white block?
[11:45:30] <AoiC> the next image
[11:45:34] <AoiC> "Rivers at Risk"
[11:45:45] <R13ose> AoiC: Map too?
[11:46:00] <AoiC> yeah - the image and some description
[11:46:11] <AoiC> the text "When Rivers run dry" stays through out the scroll though
[11:46:29] <ThePendulum> Does anyone know more about detecting which key is being pressed on mobile keyboards? They .which after a keydown event only triggers 0s
[11:48:17] <R13ose> AoiC: Right, so I don't know why the white block is there.  I don't want that.  The When Rivers run dry should go away when the first section is done.
[11:49:22] <AoiC> #wrrd has position: fixed though, R13ose
[11:49:36] <AoiC> I bet it prevents the text from going away
[11:49:50] <R13ose> AoiC: what should this have?
[11:50:31] <AoiC> no idea - it seems you are using this to position it.. but if you do it like that, position: fixed will prevent the text from scrolling and disappearing
[11:50:34] <R13ose> ThePendulum: iPhone and Android?
[11:51:42] <ThePendulum> R13ose: Not sure about iPhone, but but SwiftKey and the CM/Android stock keyboard just return 0s for key.which
[11:51:53] <ThePendulum> or e.which in most keyup/down examples
[11:52:09] <R13ose> AoiC: the text is scrolling now, and yes I know this might not allow this to disappear but I want to get the images working first.
[11:54:01] <R13ose> ThePendulum: does this help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10616567/how-to-listen-the-keypress-in-the-soft-keyboard
[11:56:34] <AoiC> R13ose I googled a little and found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5036850/how-to-detect-page-scroll-to-a-certain-point-in-jquery it seems properly detecting scrolling isn't that easy
[11:56:39] <ThePendulum> R13ose: That seems to be available to native apps only
[11:56:45] <ThePendulum> I'm using jQuery on a website here
[11:59:28] <R13ose> ThePendulum: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9787915/jquery-detect-if-keyboard-key-is-held-down
[11:59:59] <andromedian> i want to show css animation on scrolling any recomendations on how to do it or libraries?
[12:00:19] <ThePendulum> R13ose: I'm confused by that thread. That's just the normal way of key detection? The problem is it doesn't work on mobile
[12:00:40] <ThePendulum> oh it's about key holds, so they're taking it a step further
[12:00:42] <R13ose> AoiC: I don't why I would need that.  Do you understand what I want to do?
[12:00:50] <R13ose> ThePendulum: yep
[12:00:53] <ThePendulum> R13ose: Seems like the OP there isn't even experiencing the issue I had and has moved on from there
[12:01:02] <ThePendulum> I can't even get a normal keypress to register xD
[12:01:11] <ThePendulum> I should try keyup
[12:01:34] <AoiC> I thought I did
[12:01:52] <AoiC> fade-in/fade-out the div blocks depending on their offsetHeight?
[12:02:07] <ThePendulum> aww that didn't help either
[12:02:21] <R13ose> AoiC:  Slowly fade in and out as you scroll down the page.
[12:02:26] <R13ose> ThePendulum: why?
[12:02:33] <ThePendulum> I guess mobile users will have to do with just enter and the visual (x) buttons then
[12:02:50] <ThePendulum> R13ose: I don't know why, keydown just doesn't return any value but 0 except when enter is hit (which returns the default 13)
[12:03:13] <ThePendulum> so I can't really use the keyboard shortcuts I am using for this tag editor
[12:04:21] <R13ose> AoiC: You don't know how to do that?
[12:04:52] <AoiC> sorry - I don't .. not off the bat :x
[12:05:31] <R13ose> AoiC: no worries
[12:06:03] <AoiC> I would suppose there's a jquery slider plugin for that somewhere, but I haven't dealt with that and since I would think one would have to tie it to the scroll-event and that one is a bit difficult in terms of possible visual lags, I do not think I can comprehensively help you
[12:06:59] <R13ose> AoiC: thanks for trying
[12:08:10] <AoiC> R13ose try that: http://www.jqueryscript.net/animation/jQuery-Plugin-To-Fade-In-Elements-When-Scrolling-Down-FadeInScroll.html perhaps it is what you are looking for
[12:09:22] <R13ose> AoiC: maybe
[12:14:16] <R13ose> ThePendulum: does this help: http://therealmofcode.com/posts/2014/03/where-is-keypress-event-chrome-android.html
[12:24:26] <R13ose> ThePendulum: did that work?
[12:39:21] <ThePendulum> R13ose: I was thinking about working with the input field. The problem is that backspace is the primary key missing, so I can't just look at the last character inputted
[12:40:05] <ThePendulum> comparing lengths isn't going to work very well either because how would that work when no character exists in the input yet
[12:41:18] <PCatinean> Hey guys
[12:41:55] <ThePendulum> Hey guy
[12:42:06] <PCatinean> I have a few input fields that have requred class and the jquery validator class picks it up and makes the fields required, the problem is that it doesn't happen with input fields only with select fields for some reason, anyone know why?
[12:42:09] <R13ose> ThePendulum:
[12:42:10] <R13ose> okay
[12:42:24] <ThePendulum> R13ose: I'm sorry :p
[12:44:26] <R13ose> ThePendulum: no worries.  I am having trouble with my problem anyways
[12:46:37] <PCatinean> Anyone have any idea?
[12:50:25] <R13ose> How do I make this go faster: var percent = $(document).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); ?
[12:56:26] <sacho> why do you need to make it go faster?
[12:56:57] <R13ose> sacho: I am using this to do $('.bcg').css('opacity', 1 - percent); and that is fading out too slowly.
[12:57:45] <sacho> erm
[12:59:42] <R13ose> sacho: what is wrong?
[13:00:28] <sacho> the speed depends on how fast you scroll, what are you actually trying to do?
[13:01:59] <R13ose> sacho: yes but it is going too slow, is there another way to do this faster?
[13:02:46] <sacho> you could make it only fade during say 50% of the scroll, with the first 25% being fully opaque and the last 25% being fully transparent
[13:02:58] <sacho> e.g. 1.25 - percent * 2 limited between 1/0
[13:03:18] <sacho> rather 1.5*
[13:07:24] <R13ose> sacho: I am using $(window).scrollTop() / $(window).height(); now
[13:12:11] <R13ose> sacho: can I pm you a dropbox link of my work to see if you can help me figure this out?
[13:13:44] <Uhkis> its not that hard to add to that percent
[13:14:29] <R13ose> Uhkis: yes but the next part I am doing is causing me problems.  The scroll is working no problem now.
[13:14:42] <Uhkis> oh ok
[13:16:18] <R13ose> I am trying to get background images to fade in and out using opacity and make sure they appear correctly.  Yet, they are appearing one ontop of the other instead of in some cases behind one another.
[13:17:29] <Uhkis> sounds like a css problem
[13:19:58] <R13ose> Uhkis: everyone is booting me here and there.  If this is z-index, I am already using that.  Also how do I make sure that the opacity only goes as low as 0 and as high as 1?
[13:20:48] <Uhkis> use a variable and do comparison
[13:40:28] <R13ose> Uhkis: I am doing this now: http://pastebin.com/tBEcQL3F is still causing many errors as is going beyond 0 and 1 and the fourth one is showing at 3.1 for some reason.
[13:42:03] <Uhkis> ugh
[13:43:31] <RavinduL> Hi! Why doesn't $("#my-iframe").contents().find('li').hide(); work to hide all list items within an iframe?
[13:45:05] <R13ose> Uhkis: yes I know this is a mess
[13:45:51] <HiddenKnowledge> I'm having a issue with a socket.io script I was working on. I'm trying to replace the text before it's send to the screen. I made a jsfiddle to make it easier to explain it: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=i9oEHSxwu5
[13:45:56] <HiddenKnowledge> The problem is jquery related
[13:47:06] <HiddenKnowledge> It tells me replace is undefined
[13:47:25] <HiddenKnowledge> But I don't see how that's possible because all the tutorials and docs online say it exists
[13:47:39] <Uhkis> R13ose: you shouldn't be comparing the max value at all when deducting and vice versa
[13:48:06] <R13ose> Uhkis: what should I do?
[13:49:12] <Uhkis> R13ose: if ($('.bcg').css('opacity') >= outf) $('.bcg').css('opacity', 1 - percent);
[13:49:33] <R13ose> Uhkis: trying that
[13:50:02] <HiddenKnowledge> I doubt the actual fiddle will work actually, here's the url to the version I was using: http://irc.fun1schat.com:3000/
[13:52:06] <R13ose> Uhkis: okay I switched that.  Yet how do I make 1 - percent work correctly outside of if (y > 0 && y < 480) { } ?
[13:52:36] <Uhkis> HiddenKnowledge: you want just msg.replace, plain js, not jquery
[13:52:43] <HiddenKnowledge> Oooooh...
[13:52:47] <HiddenKnowledge> Hah.
[13:52:49] <HiddenKnowledge> That makes sense.
[13:52:50] <HiddenKnowledge> Thanks!
[13:54:11] <Uhkis> R13ose: you also need some general version of it or what?
[13:54:33] <R13ose> Uhkis: can you rephrase?
[13:55:05] <Uhkis> R13ose: i mean why would you want something out of that exact range
[13:55:32] <R13ose> Uhkis: which range?  0 to 1?
[13:55:45] <Uhkis> 0 and 480 scroll
[13:57:03] <R13ose> Uhkis: I am not sure what you are getting at?  I am only asking to fix the 1 - percent
[13:57:38] <R13ose> Uhkis: you think I should do everything within 0 to 480 scroll?
[13:59:22] <Uhkis> make a fiddle
[14:00:59] <R13ose> Uhkis: I can send you the dropbox link that has everything in there
[14:01:30] <Uhkis> link then
[14:04:19] <R13ose> Uhkis: pmed you the link

[15:48:58] <user_corrupt> I've added jQuery to a framework that I am using (WordPress) via a Google libraries link (2.1.3), but now I am getting a console error that says the following: http://pastie.org/10026653
[15:49:42] <user_corrupt> does anyone have any idea of what the problem may be exactly?
[16:08:17] <R13ose> Uhkis: hi
[16:13:12] <eip56> Hello everyone. I am utilizing waypoints jquery plugin and I am attempting to add delay to my elements to create a cascading effect. Unfortunately it doesnt work. I am not getting any errors. They just animate in at the same time instead of one after the other. Any thoughts? here is the code there is literally nothing there to impede it http://hastebin.com/emasezopus.coffee
[16:40:02] <andromedian> i want to show css animation on scrolling any recomendations on how to do it or libraries/plugin?
[16:43:17] <R13ose> andromedian: bootstrap
[16:47:39] <andromedian> R13ose, what .js i have to include from bootstrap?
[16:49:41] <R13ose> oh left

[17:02:59] <user_corrupt> the html is rendering, I am not getting any console errors, but no animation is occurring
[17:03:44] <user_corrupt> does it look like I will need more code if I want this bit of code to work on page load?

[17:32:53] <cuppy> Hi, all - I hope you're having a good Saturday evening/Sunday morning. As an independent web designer, I wish to begin a cross-conversation with #html, #html5, #css, #jquery, and ##javascript, and #web about the current state of efficient web design, with a secondary focus on responsive design. This will take place tonight, Monday, and Tuesday. With respect to off-topicness, I believe all chans would have something to contribute to this discussion,
[17:33:00] <cuppy> however I will not resist direction to take the discussion elsewhere // As I understand it, CSS media queries seem to be overtaking jquery/javascript-based ratio oriented positioning. Can anyone elaborate as to why media queries is "better" and why js/jq is "not"?

[22:18:52] <DragonPunch> i making a request to my api server to return me some json and i get it in my jQuery ajax request
[22:18:58] <DragonPunch> but when i alert the data it sayas object Object
[23:23:20] <sacho> don't use alert to debug - use actual debugging tools

[23:45:28] <tcpman> Hey are there any good tools about for faster jquery development, like where u can click elements and select by click rather than keep writing code by hand?? i'm guessing dreamweaver of microsoft tools may do this.. i'm thinking more GNU or freeware..
[23:45:43] <tcpman> * Open source?
[23:58:58] <sacho> you can use your browser's tools - they output explicit selectors for elements, though they're rarely what you actually want.
[23:59:04] <sacho> e.g. see the elements tab in chrome's developer tools
