[08:07:12] <errorous> hello. http://dpaste.com/3D4FBX9 . This is in success function of an ajax call. Console.log logs indicators_list properly, but won't do the loop
[08:07:16] <errorous> what could be wrong?
[08:07:35] <errorous> indicators_list is an array of objects
[08:16:31] <Cork> are you sure it really is an array and not a string?
[08:16:54] <Cork> console.log(typof(indicators_list))
[08:17:49] <Cork> errorous: ^
[08:18:01] <Uhkis> that moment when typo has the word typo in it :D
[08:18:29] <Cork> lol
[08:18:30] <Uhkis> typeof, not typof
[08:18:47] <Cork> * console.log(typeof(indicators_list))
[08:18:56] <Cork> had to check three times to see the error XD
[08:19:02] <undefined_bob> lol
[08:19:05] <errorous> Cork I was using string indexed array :/
[08:19:21] <Cork> errorous: there is nothing called string indexed arrays
[08:19:22] <errorous> hence each failing
[08:19:27] <Cork> those are either a broken array or an object
[08:19:33] <Cork> only php calls objects array
[08:19:34] <errorous> Cork object, that is
[08:44:18] <codeit> how to reduce my result in console.log() like result is in html -- > https://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/b9q0te2j/55/
[09:18:25] <Cork> codeit: you just want a loop, not reduce
[09:19:25] <Cork> cause ya, as you want to create a summary of the objects it isn't really something built into array
[09:37:36] <codeit> Cork: Got it like this -> https://jsfiddle.net/csornmo/b9q0te2j/42
[09:38:14] <Cork> why the double loop?
[09:38:26] <codeit> Just trying to get this to less code
[09:38:28] <Cork> ah you move the object from the old array to the new one
[09:39:07] <codeit> less code = easier to read :)
[09:43:39] <Cork> codeit: this is how i would do it https://jsfiddle.net/42mgw9x8/
[09:45:39] <Cork> codeit: the old code would make baseData[1].done == 2
[09:45:43] <Cork> and i don't think you want that
[09:53:48] <codeit> Cork: nice, that was exacly what I was looking for. Thx!
[09:53:56] <Cork> np
[12:53:24] <Phruis> so any way to hide a modal but not have it "unloaded"?
[13:28:05] <Phruis> yo
[13:53:14] <admin123> Phruis: example in fiddle?
[15:40:48] <worst[je]> I am having trouble accessing a data attribute specified in html using Jquery 1.12.4. Using $($s).html(), I can see data-id="3" in the element. But if I use $($s).attr("data-id") or $($s).data("id"), I always get back undefined. What am I doing wrong?
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> worst[je] would have to see it.
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> worst[je] something tells me $s isn't what you think it is.
[15:56:24] <worst[je]> robertmaxrees, That's why I said I am testing it with .html(); I can see the class and data attributes if I look at it that way.
[15:56:45] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code you're having issues with?
[15:57:49] <worst[je]> Sure, let me pastebin the (currently non-working) code to pastebin, sec.
[15:57:58] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle would be even better :)
[16:00:43] <worst[je]> ugh, kinda painful, this will take a bit longer than I figured it would
[16:01:11] <robertmaxrees> :/ is there nothing to actually paste?
[16:01:23] <robertmaxrees> or rather, like... what's gonna make it take so long?
[16:03:04] <worst[je]> The code tries to adjust some dynamically generated code that it can't get to from a fiddle, so I'm tearing out the bits that don't matter.
[16:03:15] <robertmaxrees> ah, gotcha.  hrm.
[16:05:10] <worst[je]> robertmaxrees, here you go: https://jsfiddle.net/mtyboa81/
[16:07:06] <robertmaxrees> so first off - you see the error, right?
[16:07:31] <worst[je]> I see the error in the console, yes. I don't know how to solve it, no doubt because I am newbie with jquery.
[16:08:04] <worst[je]> Hence my trying the various varieties of trying to get at the html attribute. If I am still going about it wrong, then I am somehow sniffing out the wrong trail Google is leading me on, thus coming here.
[16:08:11] <robertmaxrees> :) so your first issue is that 'td' isn't a jquery object - you need to manually call jquery if you want to use in on those elements.
[16:09:24] <worst[je]> Right, I sort of figured something like that was going on, although I am not sure why it took me out of the jquery world there.
[16:09:53] <robertmaxrees> becuase the library doesn't want to assume anything - the jquery constructor can be expensive in some cases.
[16:09:58] <worst[je]> And I don't know how to get back to it either. (But you guessed that already, I guess.) The aim is to loop over every row one by one.
[16:10:03] <robertmaxrees> so it's letting you make that choice.
[16:10:14] <robertmaxrees> so start with this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rLz2cqj6/5/
[16:10:36] <robertmaxrees> but now the second issue - you aren't selecting what you think you're selecting.
[16:10:45] <worst[je]> ... that is a stupid level of simple I can't believe I haven't tried.
[16:11:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> i assume you're trying to select those divs, yeah?
[16:11:46] <worst[je]> The goal is the first td in every tr.
[16:12:07] <robertmaxrees> none of the TDs in your html have any data attributes.
[16:12:31] <worst[je]> Div or td doesn't matter much for me in this case; the server-side framework is over-annotating a bit due to the mix of libraries going on, but it is all the same value.
[16:12:44] <worst[je]> ... OK, I see what you mean.
[16:12:50] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to select?
[16:13:13] <worst[je]> I guess the div then. Thanks.
[16:13:23] <robertmaxrees> if that's the case, just select on the class and call it a day :)
[16:13:41] <worst[je]> (I feel like an utter idiot. I look back at literal pages of staring at the output of $(...).html(), which screams 'div' at me, yet I read over it time and time again.
[16:14:01] <robertmaxrees> :) it's all good duder.  you're learning.  i make dumb mistakes like that every day.
[16:15:04] <worst[je]> I am trying to structure my code to be as agnostic to the sortable widget, which is why I wanted to target the table.
[16:15:29] <robertmaxrees> sure - you can target that class through a particular table.
[16:15:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rLz2cqj6/9/
[16:16:55] <worst[je]> Right, thank you very much. :)
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> definitely :)
[17:19:54] <Pentarou_> Hello, can anyone please help me set the datepicker language to Dutch and make the script loopable? > https://codepen.io/Pentarou/pen/zYGNRjp
[17:21:28] <robertmaxrees> "loopable"?
[17:21:56] <Pentarou_> I can use it only once, but I wish to use it inside a product miniature of Prestashop.
[17:26:26] <robertmaxrees> Pentarou_ so for the language, you'll want to include the proper file from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/ui/i18n
[17:26:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll include that after jquery and jquery-ui
[17:27:11] <robertmaxrees> and then in your init, you'll need to do $('#datepicker').datepicker( $.datepicker.regional[ "hi" ] );
[17:27:35] <Pentarou_> Thanks robertmaxrees, I copied the script and made it my own, but I'm still learning.
[17:27:44] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:28:32] <robertmaxrees> as for your second question, you'll need to refactor this to not use IDs, but classes instead.
[17:28:55] <Pentarou_> Thanks again, robertmaxrees!
[17:29:11] <robertmaxrees> sure!
[17:32:11] <Pentarou_> It now works perfectly, I included the file after jquery, but I still have a hard time implementing the script $('#datepicker').datepicker( $.datepicker.regional[ "hi" ] );
[17:32:36] <robertmaxrees> so first off - you need to change the "hi" to be whatever language you want.
[17:32:45] <robertmaxrees> and #datepicker is selecting an ID - you need to use classes instead.
[17:34:18] <Pentarou_> Thanks, I will try that.
[17:34:44] <robertmaxrees> ftr you can't use an ID more than once on a page - an ID has to be unique.
[17:38:26] <Pentarou_> Thanks robertmaxrees, I would have turned it into a class, eventually, but I didn't realize that it would make much of a difference to leave it as an ID. I got it all working now! :D
[17:38:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:49:22] <errorous> hello. I've array with objects, where each object has only one property. How do I make an array out of all object's properties
[17:49:24] <errorous> ?
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> errorous erm, not really a jquery question?
[17:49:55] <errorous> robertmaxrees, hmm, why?
[17:49:55] <robertmaxrees> either way, make a fiddle and we can try to help.
[17:51:47] <errorous> robertmaxrees http://dpaste.com/0A5FAE1
[17:52:18] <robertmaxrees> so you want an array of the property names?
[17:53:30] <errorous> robertmaxrees yes. Each object has only one property
[17:54:34] <robertmaxrees> could use map on my_array and then return the result of Object.keys(foo).join('');
[17:56:54] <robertmaxrees> errorous
[18:01:00] <errorous> robertmaxrees yeah, thought of that. But in this case, it would be easier to use $.each
[18:01:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:01:14] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:01:26] <errorous> a tad cleaner code, ain't it?
[18:01:33] <robertmaxrees> less clean.
[18:01:46] <robertmaxrees> you want to take an array and map it into a new format.
[18:02:14] <robertmaxrees> using Array.prototype.map() is much clearer about your intent and expectations :)
[18:05:51] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy Think! music
[19:02:56] <Pentarou_> Thanks again, will be joining this channel more often, good night!
