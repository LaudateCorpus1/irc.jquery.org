[00:00:06] <Promess> sorry, does that one work?
[00:00:20] <Cork> click the save button
[00:00:35] <Promess> http://jsfiddle.net/L2tbd/
[00:00:52] <Promess> haha, i'm really sorry and appreciate your patience cork
[00:01:15] <Cork> Promess: there is no structure in that fiddle
[00:01:25] <Cork> so i can't even tell if data() is an array or an object
[00:01:31] <Promess> it's an array
[00:01:34] <Promess> sorry
[00:01:40] <Cork> though i can say that line 3 is invalid
[00:01:50] <Cork> your trying to create an object through array
[00:35:47] <Aquaword> morning
[00:36:13] <Aquaword> can I quit from a hover effect?
[00:36:25] <Aquaword> on the hover part I mean
[00:36:42] <Cork> what?
[00:36:50] <Aquaword> Cork, example:
[00:37:10] <Aquaword> I hover over a div, but when I hover over an inner div, the hover event stops
[00:37:28] <Cork> ?api mouseenter
[00:37:28] <b-ot> Cork: .mouseenter(): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[00:37:36] <Cork> ?api mouseleave
[00:37:36] <b-ot> Cork: .mouseleave(): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[00:37:51] <Aquaword> so I should replace hover to them
[00:38:06] <Cork> Aquaword: hover checks if you hover that specific element
[00:38:20] <Cork> so when/if you move to a child you trigger out
[00:38:37] <Cork> enter/leave checks for this and handles the checks
[00:38:56] <Aquaword> i see
[00:38:58] <Aquaword> clear
[00:55:07] <Aquaword> Cork, I start to catch it, thx
[00:55:23] <coRz> ello and good morning ;)
[01:05:47] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/Qh9X5/780/ --> Hi guys! I'm stuck and need some help with this stupid d3 graph that's having issues in a backbone env. due to code duplication. I figure I can just have it remove the drawn chart before rendering it again, but having no luck. Is there any way I can force a redraw?
[01:06:19] <hlve> Or is this something that needs to be completely rewritten to avoid code duplication when there are multiple charts loaded in the dom.
[01:06:29] <hlve> and if so, can anybody help a brother out? :o
[01:25:14] <fosser_josh> How to remove special character from the element of jquery array?
[01:28:29] <joroci> whay character?
[01:36:49] <fosser_josh> joroci: i used replace(). and its working fine.
[01:50:22] <nights> how can i work with ajaxloaded js functions?
[01:50:35] <nights> all get is "not defined"
[01:50:56] <Cork> if they are actually parsed and added to a scope you have access to
[01:50:58] <Cork> they just work
[01:51:16] <nights> hmm
[01:51:19] <nights> oh actually
[01:51:23] <nights> if i placed them outside
[01:51:27] <nights> $( function()
[01:51:28] <nights> it works
[01:51:39] <nights> so you are right
[01:51:49] <nights> a bit confused when to place functions inside $( function()
[01:52:57] <Cork> nights: defining functions inside $(func () {})
[01:53:12] <Cork> is only useful if you want to hide them from global
[01:53:22] <nights> hm i see
[01:53:35] <Cork> the call is to wait for when the page is loaded
[01:53:44] <nights> yes
[01:53:57] <nights> $("#menu_panel").on("click", ".menuitem_interact", function(event)
[01:53:59] <nights> these type
[01:54:04] <nights> if i dont place them inside the ready func
[01:54:07] <nights> they dont trigger
[01:54:10] <Cork> ya
[01:54:17] <Cork> cause the dom isn't parsed yet
[01:54:17] <nights> why is that?
[01:54:20] <nights> hm
[01:54:22] <nights> ah
[01:54:29] <nights> so regular JS work outside readyu
[01:54:36] <Cork> anything works outside
[01:54:43] <Cork> as long as it doesn't try to access the dom
[01:54:52] <nights> i see...
[01:55:00] <nights> that explains a lot
[01:55:09] <Cork> $(func () {}) is a helper for the DOMContentLoaded event
[01:55:16] <Cork> with a fallback on onload
[01:55:34] <Cork> that's basically all it is
[01:56:39] <nights> i see
[01:57:07] <nights> so jquery builds upon some browser callback for when the dom is loaded
[01:57:14] <nights> i mean JS
[01:57:24] <Cork> jquery is just a helper framework
[01:57:47] <Cork> it's all basically normal js + some helper functions
[01:58:30] <nights> yes sorry, i know that
[01:58:42] <nights> thanks Cork
[01:58:47] <Cork> np
[02:02:00] <seutje> anyone happen to know of GeoJSON editing tools that aren't web-based?
[02:19:58] <kamuela> If I'm trying to create a widget that people can drop into their HTML, how do I take care of CSS and HTML within the script tags?
[02:22:54] <sunbeam> When you scroll down with a browser, where is defined the increments (in px) you scroll down?
[02:23:57] <kamuela> Can I just do a document.write() to produce <div>'s and css styling within a script tag?
[02:24:17] <Cork> kamuela: you give them a css that they use
[02:24:31] <Cork> kamuela: and specify rules that only matches your widget
[02:24:41] <Cork> and never ever EVER use document.write
[02:25:25] <kamuela> Cork: i'm not exactly sure what you mean for me to try
[02:25:45] <Cork> kamuela: what i mean is; the script should not inject the css files
[02:25:52] <Cork> just give them the resource to load them self
[02:26:04] <Cork> so if they want to modify it, it is easy to do
[02:26:17] <kamuela> Cork: meaning an external style sheet?
[02:26:21] <Cork> yes
[02:26:41] <Cork> css belongs in css not in js
[02:27:18] <kamuela> Cork: and so if i'm not to use document.write(), how do i produce the widget's output?
[02:27:48] <Cork> kamuela: by modifying the dom in a way that has been invented since 1995
[02:27:50] <Cork> :)
[02:28:29] <Cork> kamuela: you can append dom elements, add html through .html() [innerHTML] and a few other ways
[02:28:51] <Cork> documetn.write is only still around to provide support for the pages that was written back then
[02:29:06] <Cork> it is broken; really broken, and there is no use case for it
[02:29:46] <bigbugjava> meaning: $("element).css('display','block'); and such?
[02:29:55] <kamuela> do you mean to include a widget.css as a link? how could i implement that in a shareable way? i write a .html () [<link rel="absolutecsspath.css"><div id="this-widget">function();</div>] ?
[02:30:33] <Cork> kamuela: "to use this widget add these lines in your head"
[02:31:00] <Cork> kamuela: and preferably "then call $('target').my_widget(options) to enable it where you want it to show"
[02:31:06] <Cork> and then you can add a few examples
[02:31:25] <Cork> make it simple, not dumb
[02:31:55] <kamuela> hmm, that's gonna be rough. both an addition to header and a jquery requirement. might be too many edits to make it easily shareable
[02:32:10] <Cork> uh..
[02:32:22] <Cork> two entries is too much?!?
[02:32:39] <kamuela> hey not for me! but for folks used to one <script> block
[02:32:48] <kamuela> analytics for example, one script
[02:33:02] <kamuela> counters, one script, most things are just one script block
[02:33:05] <bigbugjava> Cork when you done with kamuela, if ya able to explain how to make css loading in dom, I can make it work on same page, but not when loading like untill page is loading facebook pictures load.
[02:33:19] <Cork> kamuela: well sure you could give them a <script></script block that generates the other parts if you find that "better"
[02:33:25] <Cork> though that is just silly if you ask me
[02:33:46] <Cork> bigbugjava: jquery provides ways to set inline style, nothing else
[02:34:06] <Cork> bigbugjava: if you want to add rules include a css resource in head
[02:34:19] <kamuela> Cork: i don't know if i find it better, i just think it's probably easier for the layperson. but now i don't want to use document.write() if that's a broken method
[02:34:42] <BinaryKitten> bigbugjava $('<link>', {href: 'yoururl', 'type': 'text/css'}).appendTo('head');
[02:34:51] <Cork> kamuela: well it is fine if you write a page for 1994-1996
[02:35:05] <Cork> but ya, since then theres been many better ways to do it
[02:35:11] <anli> Is .click interfering with onmousedown?
[02:35:19] <sunbeam> When you scroll down with a browser, where is defined the increments (in px) you scroll down?
[02:35:21] <Cork> anli: no
[02:35:24] <BinaryKitten> depends on what .click anli
[02:35:26] <Imdsm> is there an easy way to reference the current object in this line: $('.class').css('width', (this.width + 1) + 'px')?
[02:35:31] <Cork> anli: the even order is the reverse
[02:35:34] <anli> How many .click are there?
[02:35:42] <anli> onmousedown first, I presume
[02:35:42] <Imdsm> (this.width obviously doesn't work in that example)
[02:35:59] <Cork> Imdsm: you would have to use .each
[02:36:05] <BinaryKitten> 2 for jQuery. .click()  // triggger   and .click(function()    // handler
[02:36:12] <Cork> anli: mousedown > mouseup > click
[02:36:17] <anli> yes
[02:36:26] <anli> I use onmousedown="return stringifyFields(),true"
[02:36:35] <Imdsm> Cork: thanks
[02:36:39] <anli> Should do its job, but it seems that I am not coming to the click handler then
[02:36:44] <BinaryKitten> Cork i always thought it was mousedown > click > mouseup
[02:36:48] <BinaryKitten> anli don't do that
[02:36:53] <anli> BinaryKitten: Why not?
[02:36:56] <BinaryKitten> use proper event binding
[02:37:01] <anli> Thats proper
[02:37:05] <BinaryKitten> no that's inline
[02:37:08] <Cork> BinaryKitten: actually it depends a bit, it isn't defined cross platforms
[02:37:18] <Cork> BinaryKitten: but most platforms have down > up > click
[02:37:20] <BinaryKitten> anything can mess that inline js up
[02:37:21] <Cork> but not all
[02:37:38] <Cork> som have down > click > up; i think mac does
[02:37:46] * BinaryKitten needs to reboot
[02:37:54] <anli> inline is proper as well
[02:38:00] <anli> I am not into that discussion btw
[02:38:54] <kamuela> Cork: I think I found what you're saying. There's document.getElementById("elementname").innerHTML = 'etc'; but if i included a stylesheet link within that would the div know to load itself if it is defined within that sheet?
[02:39:15] <Cork> kamuela: no
[02:39:25] <Cork> and you can't load an event inside a stylesheet
[02:39:34] <Cork> you either load a style or you don't
[02:39:48] <kamuela> hmm this is rough, i thought a self-contained widget would be a little more straightforward
[02:39:52] <Cork> if it matches an element as it gets added to the dom, it will affect the elements look
[02:40:16] <Cork> kamuela: if you don't want to use stylesheets you need to set all the rules inline on each element
[02:40:27] <Cork> and all the psudo-rules is impossible to make
[02:40:35] <Cork> (i really don't recommend going this way)
[02:40:50] <Cork> kamuela: if you really want to isolate the widget use an iframe
[02:41:02] <Cork> then you can set everything up exactly as you want it, and nothing can fiddle with it
[02:42:07] <kamuela> Cork: ahh so a complete HTML document that i just give to users to inject into theirs?
[02:42:18] <Cork> well a link
[02:42:19] <Cork> but ya
[02:42:29] <kamuela> i think that works
[02:42:30] <Cork> it is what facebook and the others like that do
[02:42:57] <Cork> though if you just want a simple widget it is overkill
[02:43:11] <Cork> and you should just go with a simple css + js solution
[02:43:57] <kamuela> Cork: but still meaning splitting the code between a script, a css document, and a div, right?
[02:44:27] <Cork> kamuela: well styling should happen in a stylesheet, it is just how you write webpage content
[02:44:55] <Cork> and to make it easy to manage the site owner should have an element that the widget resides in
[02:46:53] <anli> Why is this example not trigging on mouse down? http://jsfiddle.net/5dANP/
[02:48:07] <Cork> triggers here
[02:48:43] <Cork> anli: http://jsfiddle.net/5dANP/2/
[02:49:00] <anli> Ah!
[02:49:04] <anli> lol
[02:49:14] <anli> thx
[02:49:14] <Cork> alert is a bad choice of debugging tool
[02:49:19] <anli> yeah
[02:55:40] <SprkDev> http://acornejo.github.io/jquery-cropbox/
[02:56:22] <SprkDev> I am currently using the above plugin.
[02:57:11] <SprkDev> I have implemented it in my website. But I want to crop the file without a download box appear. How can I do that? So that the file gets created without a download box appearing?
[02:57:37] <Cork> file gets created where?
[02:59:26] <Kingsy> if I have a rel attribute on an element which contains say "this:'that',something:'else'"   what is the best wya of getting that into an object? So I can access values using   data.something  for example?
[02:59:43] <Kingsy> just using attr() gives you a string... the object would be nice
[03:00:00] <Cork> Kingsy: 1. don't use rel for data
[03:00:10] <Cork> use data-<your choice>=""
[03:00:20] <Cork> secondly make it a valid json object
[03:00:31] <Cork> and thirdly use .data('attribute')
[03:00:35] <Cork> the rest should just work
[03:03:13] <Kingsy> Cork: hmm  so   <li data-smallImage="somevalue"></li>     $("li").data("smallImage); ?>
[03:03:18] <Kingsy> ?*
[03:03:20] <Cork> yes
[03:04:12] <Kingsy> hmm its just undefined.. which is weird
[03:04:22] <Cork> <li data-smallImage="{this:&quot;that&quot;}"></li>
[03:04:36] <Cork> $("li").data('smallImage').this;
[03:05:06] <Cork> just make sure the first li in the selection result is the one you want :)
[03:05:13] <Kingsy> yeah :D
[03:06:44] <Cork> ah, right they don't support uppercase anymore
[03:07:12] <Cork> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/8dErB/
[03:10:00] <Kingsy> Cork: prefect
[03:10:10] <Kingsy> perfect** man I can type today
[03:13:11] <SprkDev> http://acornejo.github.io/jquery-cropbox/
[03:13:30] <SprkDev> I need that download file to upload to server instead without the prompt box. How do I do that?
[03:17:05] <grafi> SprkDev whats the backend?
[03:37:25] <SprkDev> file gets created on the clients hard drive. I want it to be createrd on the server.
[03:37:38] <SprkDev> http://acornejo.github.io/jquery-cropbox/
[03:37:57] <grafi> [12:16:51] <grafi> SprkDev whats the backend?
[03:38:39] <SprkDev> How does that work?
[03:39:00] <SprkDev> just a sec
[03:39:38] <SprkDev> Well right now there is no backend apart from what you would see in view source at that link.
[03:40:09] <JavierAsks> hello! I'm using .siblings().removeClass('playing'); but its not working if the object its outside the div. How do I remove the class playing from every object on the DOM to prevent it?
[03:40:39] <grafi> SprkDev let me rephrase then, whats the stack on the backend? php?
[03:40:53] <Cork> JavierAsks: $('.playing').removeClass('playing')
[03:42:32] <JavierAsks> mmm Cork for some reason it is not working. I'm using $(this).addClass('playing').siblings().removeClass('playing');
[03:42:38] <fosser_josh> i am writing code for dialog box http://pastebin.com/Nr6DDQss. when i 1st time click on yes it works fine. it closes dialog box. but i do it on next time it dosent work.
[03:42:58] <Cork> JavierAsks: the code i gave you isn't even in there...
[03:43:08] <Cork> JavierAsks: how would siblings match all elements in the page?
[03:43:19] <fosser_josh> this code runs under button click. So on button click it shows popup for shutdown
[03:43:28] <Cork> JavierAsks: this should work just fine: $('.playing').removeClass('playing'); $(this).addClass('playing');
[03:44:42] <Cork> fosser_josh: make sure the old content isn't left in the page
[03:44:55] <Cork> cause then you would have multiple elements with the same id
[03:45:15] <fosser_josh> Cork: how to clear those content?
[03:45:28] <Cork> .remove() after you close it
[03:46:00] <Cork> or just have it statically and show/close it
[03:46:07] <Cork> *open/close
[03:46:29] <JavierAsks> THAT WORKS! Thanks guys
[03:46:31] <JavierAsks> Cork:  thanks man
[03:46:50] <fosser_josh> Cork: thanks
[03:47:38] <flongo> morning. quick question on jQuery namespacing/noconflict and JS widgets. I've done this - var $PS = jQuery.noConflict(); which works just fine even when loading other plugins such as jquery-ui, however this fails with 1 third party plugin that may not have been written properly. how do I ensure that plugin respects my namespacing as currently it complains that jQuery is not available ?
[03:47:57] <Cork> @_@
[03:48:08] <Cork> flongo: please separate the question from the info next time
[03:48:29] <flongo> ok :)
[03:48:30] <Cork> flongo: noConflict is to prevent jquery from conflicting with outher frameworks
[03:48:40] <Cork> it doesn't help with plugins
[03:48:51] <Cork> if you load multiple versions of jquery you are in for a pain
[03:49:17] <Cork> the plugins will stick to the jquery version that currently occupies the window.jQuery variable
[03:49:30] <Cork> and only way around that is to monky-patch the plugins
[03:50:17] <flongo> cork: im not loading multiple versions of jquery - i just want to namespace it, so my widget doesnt interfere with what else is happening on the site. all the plugins except for 1 have no problems about the namespacing
[03:50:39] <Cork> flongo: well that is the same thing
[03:51:16] <Cork> if you want to have a separate instance of jquery (namespace) you need to monky-patch the plugins to not do (function($) {})(jQuery)
[03:51:36] <Cork> and instead do (function($) {})(your-special-hidden-jquery-version)
[03:52:09] <Cork> but really it's better to just let the page handle it
[03:52:58] <flongo> so i shouldnt even bother with "var $PS = jQuery.noConflict();" ?
[03:53:11] <Cork> not from a plugin no
[03:53:22] <Cork> the site loading things should do it if they need to
[03:53:35] <flongo> no that's from the widget, thats loading the plugins :)
[03:53:46] <Cork> widgets shouldn't load plugins
[03:53:58] <Cork> it should list it as a requirement
[03:54:39] <Cork> else you end up with pages that load 5 different versions of jquery and 3 versions of jquery-ui and 2-3 ex of different extra plugins
[03:54:59] <flongo> ah i remember having this discussion with you before on here :) i went with yoru suggestion of having jquery as a requirement, but there's a few other little display plugins that i would rather load automatically
[03:55:10] <Cork> and a site developer that can only do anything about it by patching the messed up plugins that require this
[03:55:16] <SprkDev> Anyone know of jquery plugin where you drag inside a box and it crops to what is visible?
[03:55:20] <flongo> im also checking to see if the plugin in question has alreay been loaded before loading my own versions
[03:55:27] <SprkDev> Other than this one that is http://acornejo.github.io/jquery-cropbox/
[03:55:43] <fabioportieri> for image cropping i always used jcrop
[03:55:58] <fabioportieri> it's not jquery though, iirc
[03:56:02] <flongo> cork: including plugins that we've developed
[03:56:08] <grafi> SprkDev why search a different one now oô
[03:56:35] <Cork> flongo: the points of plugins is that they should be pluggable, not embeded
[03:57:00] <SprkDev> That plugin doesn't do what I want. I want to crop the image and save it on the server. Not download it to the clients computer. That wouldn't make sense if I am doing this for the user avatar.
[03:57:08] <Cork> if it shouldn't be a plugin, don't add it like that
[03:57:55] <flongo> cork: i understand that, and they are 'pluggable' in other use cases just not when a client wants to have a little bit of widget code to do everything automagically for him on his site in the safest way possible. there's no way around this at the moment, i just need to figure out the safest way of doing it and in this case why plugins like jquery-ui have no issue with me namespacing jquery, and this 1 plugin does
[03:58:35] <grafi> SprkDev the plugin just provides the data of the cropped image to you, the downloading part is really not specific to the plugin, you could just as easy make an ajax request to your backend, save the image data to a file
[03:58:37] <Cork> flongo: if you want to inject code from js, you need to handle waiting for the code to load(or fail to load)
[03:58:52] <Cork> flongo: js loading becomes async if you inject it from script
[03:58:54] <grafi> SprkDev thats why i asked what your backend language is
[03:58:57] <Cork> so you need to handle that part
[03:58:57] <SprkDev> how would I do that?
[03:59:00] <SprkDev> I am using PHP
[03:59:08] <flongo> cork: ive done that as well using yepnope - its only the namespacing thats a problem right now :)
[03:59:11] <grafi> SprkDev http://j-query.blogspot.de/2011/02/save-base64-encoded-canvas-image-to-png.html
[03:59:18] <Cork> flongo: if your ok with that use $.getScript, but don't forget to wait for the response or you will have race
[03:59:32] <Cork> flongo: you need to patch the plugins
[03:59:33] <grafi> with that piece of code you only have to send the data you get from the plugin to a script on the backend
[03:59:47] <grafi> easy as pie
[03:59:54] <flongo> cork: its just the 1 that will need patching, what am i looking for ?
[04:00:07] <Cork> flongo: check what i said a while a go
[04:00:10] <Cork> it is in the log
[04:00:17] <flongo> ok

[04:12:51] <SprkDev> I haven't quite understood this base64 thing. I we suppose to post the the value for image with $_POST and not $_FILES ?
[04:13:58] <grafi> view the data you get from the plugin as just some text, its not really a file
[04:14:22] <jop008> if I want head and td align is center with css how to do this?
[04:14:45] <jop008> Now I use td, th {
[04:14:46] <jop008>   text-align:center;
[04:14:47] <jop008> }
[04:14:58] <Cork> jop008: center on row or center text in column?
[04:15:05] <jop008> but no center on thead
[04:15:12] <jop008> text in columns
[04:15:20] <Cork> then that should work just fine
[04:15:27] <jop008> How?
[04:15:35] <Cork> what you just showed
[04:15:43] <jop008> No left aligned
[04:15:50] <Cork> unless you have a more specific rule saying something else
[04:16:07] <jop008> can I use important for taht?
[04:16:51] <Cork> you can, but you should never use !important
[04:16:59] <Cork> fix the rules instead
[04:17:09] <jop008> better for?
[04:17:21] <Cork> !important works once
[04:17:36] <Cork> if you ever need to do something similar again, your screwed
[04:17:49] <jop008> important helps
[04:17:57] <Cork> better use the urls and make them specific if you need to override something
[04:18:00] <jop008> I can't find the conflicintg one
[04:18:02] <Cork> *rules
[04:18:11] <Cork> just use the css inspector
[04:18:29] <jop008> How to find conflicts in css?
[04:18:33] <Cork> just use the css inspector
[04:18:49] <Cork> it's in your developer tools
[04:19:16] <Cork> just inspect the element and check what rule wins
[04:19:19] <jop008> this is the one <th data-priority="1" id="title" valign="center">Vakantie villa "Comfort" voor 6 personen met 3 slaapkamers en 2 badkamers te huur in natuurgebied de Cevennes</th>
[04:19:22] <Cork> and make your new rule more specific
[04:19:42] <Cork> that is an element not a rule...
[04:20:56] <jop008> I think something inherited hard to determine which is the conflicting one
[04:21:05] <Cork> uh...
[04:21:06] <james948> hi there.
[04:21:12] <Cork> just look in the inspector...
[04:21:19] <james948> Anyone around to help me troubleshoot a jquery problem that's been driving me nuts.
[04:21:25] <Cork> it shows you exactly what happens
[04:21:33] <Cork> ?ask @ james948
[04:21:33] <b-ot> james948: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[04:22:40] <james948> If anyone could help out that would be amazing.
[04:23:08] <Cork> so only on ios?
[04:23:25] <james948> No. On Safari for mac too.
[04:23:42] <Cork> can't help then don't have one at hand
[04:23:52] <james948> Och. Thanks anyway :)

[04:46:35] <MalMen> hello, i have this jQuery('.browse').each(function(ind,obj){       console.log(obj); }); i need to output the content inside every selector i foind
[04:46:56] <MalMen> i am trying to understund how to do that yet
[04:47:35] <Cork> MalMen: every selector?
[04:47:40] <Cork> you mean every element?
[04:47:43] <MalMen> yes
[04:47:50] <MalMen> thanks for fix me
[04:48:00] <MalMen> with jQuery('.browse').each i cant get what i want
[04:48:04] <Cork> console.log(this.outerHTML); should work
[04:48:13] <MalMen> let me test
[04:48:34] <roy_raider> re :)
[04:49:23] <Cork> MalMen: little warning outerHTML depends on gecko 11.0
[04:49:36] <Cork> it is a bit over a year old, so it should be safe to use now
[04:50:00] <Cork> if you just want the content you can use $(this).html()
[04:50:05] <Cork> and it should work everywhere
[04:54:37] <fosser_josh> in order to use jquery buttons which script files do i need to add?
[04:55:17] <Cork> fosser_josh: it is specified in the js file, or if you use the builder it helps you
[04:55:18] <fosser_josh> jquery-1.10.1.min.js, jquery-ui.js. other than this do i need to use any other js files?
[04:55:24] <Cork> no
[04:55:32] <Cork> well the css files for jquery-ui
[04:55:48] <fosser_josh> jquery-ui.css
[04:57:13] <fosser_josh> Cork: <span class="ui-icon  ui-icon-volume-off"></span> i tried this but didnt work
[04:57:35] <Cork> why would that do anything?
[04:57:59] <Cork> aren't you looking for the .button() part of jquery ui?
[05:00:15] <fosser_josh> Cork: i was looking into code of this. http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.6rc5/tests/static/icons.html. but seems i got confused. somehwere.
[05:00:54] <Cork> fosser_josh: that just depends on the css theme for jquery-ui
[05:00:59] <Cork> you don't need jquery for that
[05:01:46] <Cork> fosser_josh: check line 24-29 in the source
[05:07:00] <BrazenBraden> i am surprised to learn that there isnt a .capitalize() function for jquery..
[05:07:27] <Cork> just use css
[05:07:48] <Cork> text-transform: capitalize; should do the trick
[05:07:52] <BrazenBraden> yea i saw that solution.
[05:07:57] <BrazenBraden> was just surprised.. thats all
[05:08:13] <Cork> jquery don't provide many text manipulation functions
[05:08:20] <Cork> barely any actually
[05:08:52] <BrazenBraden> tis a shame
[05:08:54] <BrazenBraden> oh wells
[05:11:52] <fosser_josh> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ . i tried this
[05:12:03] <Cork> save and try again :)
[05:12:45] <fosser_josh> Cork: its not showing icon. its showing text
[05:12:59] <Cork> fosser_josh: the link you gave isn't what you meant to give
[05:13:16] <Cork> save what you added and try giving a link to the actual code
[05:13:18] <fosser_josh> Cork: hehee http://jsfiddle.net/kz9BR/
[05:13:20] <fosser_josh> sorry
[05:13:26] <fosser_josh> i forgot
[05:14:17] <Cork> hmm
[05:14:26] <Cork> that one should work...
[05:15:14] <fosser_josh> Cork: m i missing any file css or js
[05:15:15] <fosser_josh> ?
[05:15:49] <fosser_josh> Cork: here we go http://jsfiddle.net/kz9BR/
[05:16:05] <fosser_josh> jquery 1.9.1 and ui 1.9.2
[05:16:14] <Cork> fosser_josh: the css isn't loaded...
[05:16:23] <Cork> though fiddle added that by default for ui...
[05:16:40] <Cork> ah, there you go http://jsfiddle.net/kz9BR/1/
[05:20:22] <daveaway> how do i make jquery draggable drag the inner elements aswell when i drag
[05:20:44] <daveaway> alsoDrag "#myelement > div"
[05:20:46] <daveaway> ill try that
[05:23:26] <fosser_josh> Cork: can you give me link for the ui?
[05:23:26] <Cork> "the ui"?
[05:23:26] <Cork> css you mean?
[05:23:26] <fosser_josh> yeah
[05:24:28] <Cork> fosser_josh: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ or the "theme" section here http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[05:28:44] <fosser_josh> Cork: i tried minified and uncompressed but its not giving that effect
[05:28:59] <Cork> fosser_josh: have you included the css?
[05:29:08] <Cork> it won't give any visible effects if you don't
[05:31:35] <hetii> Hi :)
[05:31:51] <TheJHNZ> o/
[05:33:24] <hetii> Q: Can I use selectors in script that are located in head ?   I try set onclick acction for button that are loaded after script.
[05:34:48] <fosser_josh> Cork: http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.2/themes/base/jquery-ui.css. i saved this file as css and its not working. this driving me crazy
[05:35:48] <Ortund> I've got a C# and a VB version for each code sample on my page but I want to hide the vb ones by default... it seems my setTimeout isn't working, can anyone help me figure out why? http://loganyoung.za.net/basic-crud-in-linq-to-sql/#
[05:37:11] <SprkDev> How can I get those values from the jquery into the form post of xx, yy, ww etc?
[05:37:12] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/wrDG4stb
[05:37:18] <hetii> ok i see that can use $(document).ready(function() {}); for that :)
[05:38:30] <fosser_josh> Cork: i have some custom css. so i list all my custom css 1st and then jquery-ui css later. but its not taking any effect on it.
[05:40:06] <SprkDev> How do I assign those values into PHP?
[05:42:57] <SprkDev> help?
[05:44:05] <bigbugjava> urhhh, Simply loading CSS animations before loading the script it self! why it's giving so much ISSUES?!??!? any good examples anywhere??
[05:48:54] <fosser_josh> Cork: http://pastebin.com/egkAKC6d i wrote this simple code. same as jsfidle but on system its not working. i think i am missing css file in this?
[05:49:55] <Cork> fosser_josh: your missing jquery
[05:50:36] <fosser_josh> its there on link 4
[05:50:38] <fosser_josh> line
[05:50:49] <Cork> no that's ui
[05:52:08] <fosser_josh> Cork: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
[05:52:11] <fosser_josh> this one?
[05:52:13] <Cork> yes
[05:52:21] <fosser_josh> not working though
[05:52:37] <fosser_josh> its showing small button
[05:53:19] <fosser_josh> does this work on ur system?
[05:53:32] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/T35XR/
[05:53:46] <BinaryKitten> fosser_josh http://jsfiddle.net/T35XR/ shows it works
[05:54:03] <fosser_josh> BinaryKitten: yes but on system it dosent
[05:54:23] <BinaryKitten> fosser_josh does that url work on your system?
[05:54:30] <fosser_josh> yes
[05:54:41] <BinaryKitten> then the issue isn't jquery or jquery ui
[05:54:54] <fosser_josh> but http://pastebin.com/egkAKC6d i wrote this code and run html file
[05:54:58] <fosser_josh> and its not working
[05:55:36] <BinaryKitten> yep
[05:55:43] <BinaryKitten> because as Cork said, it has no jquery
[05:55:46] <Cork> fosser_josh: this is your exact code http://jsbin.com/onaHOCA/1/edit
[05:55:55] <Cork> and it works fine
[05:56:43] <SprkDev> How do I assign a jquery variable to PHP variable?
[05:57:03] <Cork> SprkDev: you can't
[05:57:10] <Cork> php is server side, you can't assign cross the network
[05:57:39] <Cork> if you want to send data to php you need to make an ajax call from js to the server
[05:57:44] <fosser_josh> Cork: yeah it works on jsfiddle and jsbin. but not on system. thats really wired. I am using ubuntu and google chrome. is that making any problem?
[05:57:45] <Cork> and process the data you sent
[05:57:59] <Cork> fosser_josh: copy the code in jsbin; exactly that code
[05:58:00] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/u9WnL8rB
[05:58:01] <Cork> and try locally
[05:58:16] <SprkDev> how would I make that ajax call?
[05:58:28] <Cork> ?api jquery.post
[05:58:29] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.post(): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[05:59:18] <fosser_josh> damn thats working.
[05:59:41] <fosser_josh> Cork: whats happeing here? is it the way we order script?
[06:00:01] <Cork> fosser_josh: check what differs between the jsbin code and your local one
[06:01:12] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/rv1SckkK
[06:01:13] <fosser_josh> doctype and order of script and link
[06:01:25] <Cork> fosser_josh: what order did you load the scripts?
[06:01:29] <SprkDev> I don't understand how all those value translate into that jquery ajax call.
[06:02:01] <Cork> fosser_josh: you need to load them in the order they depend on each other
[06:03:05] <SprkDev> actually what I need is the opposite of this  download.attr('href', img.getDataURI());
[06:03:19] <SprkDev> I want the file to be uploaded when this code executes without a prompt box.
[06:03:25] <fosser_josh> Cork: i will follow this order
[06:03:41] <Cork> SprkDev: so what you want is the formData object
[06:03:42] <fosser_josh> in my code i load ui first and js later
[06:03:46] <Cork> SprkDev: and a post call
[06:03:59] <SprkDev> I think so.
[06:04:01] <Cork> fosser_josh: and that will fail cause jquery-ui doesn't work without jquery
[06:04:43] <fosser_josh> yeah. i will keep in mind now onwards. thanks a lot
[06:05:09] <SprkDev> The thing is the jquery takes care of all the cropping but somewhere is causing it to get downloaded, and I want it uploaded. Can anyone tell what part of this jquery code is causing the download?
[06:06:02] <Cork> SprkDev: what the plugin does is most likely that it renders it in canvas and modifies it
[06:06:18] <Cork> SprkDev: then it grabs that data and adds it to an a link
[06:06:25] <Cork> and then triggrs click on it
[06:06:51] <Cork> SprkDev: what you want to do is to instead grab the data build a formData object with it and post it to the server
[06:06:52] <SprkDev> I think that is what it does. But what part of the jquery would I need to change. Not the big script I hope.
[06:07:00] <daveaway> this jcrop?
[06:07:12] <Cork> SprkDev: you would have to learn how the script works
[06:07:22] <Cork> shopping randomly at it won't work
[06:07:59] <SprkDev> Well this is the big part of the script http://pastebin.com/KhebtkGh
[06:08:29] <SprkDev> https://github.com/acornejo/jquery-cropbox
[06:09:32] <Cork> SprkDev: well nothing of that has anything to do with the download action
[06:09:40] <DireFog> hi, is there a way to trigger a namespaced event, say trigger('change.autoUpdate') in such a way that "plain" handlers on('change') catch it too? handle, stop, re-trigger seems rather ugly
[06:09:50] <Ortund> I've got a C# and a VB version for each code sample on my page but I want to hide the vb ones by default... it seems my setTimeout isn't working, can anyone help me figure out why? http://loganyoung.za.net/basic-crud-in-linq-to-sql/
[06:09:53] <Cork> all it does is generate a blob that it gives back to the caller
[06:10:26] <Cork> DireFog: just don't trigger them with the namespace?
[06:10:30] <daveaway> create a draggable box SprkDev, record it's coords within the confines of the image, keep updating the x y w h in the form, when you click form, send the x y w h and the current width + height of the image, send that to php
[06:10:43] <daveaway> or what ever language and crop accordingly using imagecopyresized (if php) or w/e
[06:10:55] <SprkDev> Well good, cause I think this part does it http://pastebin.com/GvXevZzd
[06:11:34] <_Aquaword> hm what a paradoxon, the ui-slider handle has a correct height, but putting online the site, has a false value
[06:11:40] <Cork> uh <?php $xx = ?> what??
[06:11:43] <_Aquaword> same files online of course
[06:11:52] <Cork> that isn't even valid php
[06:12:03] <Ortund> Cork, looks like incomplete rather than invalid
[06:12:03] <DireFog> Cork: I have some intermediate change handlers that I'd like to only trigger if the event is namespaced... Ultimately, I need a clean way to mark an event for exclusion by some handlers
[06:12:16] <Ortund> needs a value and ; between = and ?>
[06:12:26] <SprkDev> You are right! So all I have to do is assingn does jquery values to php. But how?
[06:13:11] <Cork> DireFog: '"plain" handlers on('change') catch it to' your contradicting your self
[06:13:36] <Cork> SprkDev: your still stuck in the idea you can assign things from client side to php
[06:13:37] <Cork> you can't
[06:14:11] <Cork> SprkDev: the order is webserver > runs php > generates html > sends to client > parses > runs js > generates new image
[06:14:19] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/5i6Ht0VU
[06:14:23] <Cork> there is no way for the last step to access php in the first step
[06:14:26] <Cork> it just isn'
[06:14:28] <SprkDev> so I use the ajax call
[06:14:31] <Cork> *'t possible
[06:14:37] <SprkDev> but I need to send multiple values. Check link
[06:14:49] <Cork> uh
[06:14:54] <Cork> url "none"
[06:15:06] <Cork> you need an url to send it to
[06:16:08] <MalMen> i have this html <div id="xpto"><button valor="1"></button><button valor="2"></button></div> i know that i want to find the second button inside div xpto, how can i do that ?
[06:16:52] <SprkDev> If we need a url to send it to, I can take out the php and put it into another file. But I don't know how to write that ajax call.
[06:18:18] <gavit> hi, i'm using twitter bootstrap + JQuery. When using a datepicker I don't see a calendar background which makes it hard to read. Is it possible to force a white background?
[06:18:29] <Cork> SprkDev: i suspect you don't need the php part you are fiddling with
[06:18:46] <Cork> SprkDev: what you need to to grab the data use formData build a post data content
[06:18:50] <SprkDev> I do.
[06:18:57] <Cork> SprkDev: and just post it to the script meant to handle the uploaded image
[06:19:06] <Cork> ?mdn formData
[06:19:06] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[06:19:17] <SprkDev> Because I got that part working with another plugin. This all integrated into wp see.
[06:19:42] <Cork> i see that you need to start to learn how the things you depend on work
[06:19:44] <DireFog> ah, found a way
[06:19:53] <Cork> so you have a clue about what your doing
[06:20:22] <SprkDev> what about that data row? can I have multiple values sent? How do I send all those coordinates in the ajax call?
[06:21:01] <Cork> read the documentation i linked to
[06:21:12] <SprkDev> if only the ajax call sends the values, in the retrieving part of php, I can make use of xx = $_POST['xx'] and the rest is already working.
[06:22:41] <bigbugjava> http://jsfiddle.net/SAm8R/ - why is selector not working?
[06:22:58] <Cork> bigbugjava: #
[06:23:17] <bigbugjava> yeah I added that
[06:23:21] <bigbugjava> not the problem
[06:24:09] <Cork> bigbugjava: fix the css rule too
[06:24:39] <bigbugjava> ?
[06:24:44] <Cork> #
[06:24:56] <Cork> first char in the css selector
[06:25:04] <bigbugjava> $('#ajaxloader1').css('display','block');?
[06:25:09] <Cork> the css section
[06:25:31] <Cork> the js works, the css doesn't
[06:25:37] <Cork> cause it have the same problem you had in js
[06:25:50] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/SAm8R/4/
[06:26:03] <bigbugjava> Cork yeah now works
[06:26:04] <Velveeta> there, botht he css and js selectors fixed, and jquery actually included in the page
[06:26:38] <bigbugjava> thanks
[06:26:56] <bigbugjava> Now how can I make it work for atleast 1 sec and then excute others ?
[06:27:23] <Velveeta> like, put a 1 second delay before executing other code?
[06:27:50] <jayayseakay> Hello folks, on my code here.. http://jsfiddle.net/bwP7R/ I have to build a 'loan calculator' for an assignment at university. Each of the different loans has different min max loan amounts/terms etc.. what would be the best way to do that in that code?
[06:27:57] <bigbugjava> yeah,  becasuse it's loading fast, and I want this to appear
[06:28:12] <bigbugjava> make site look smart.. lol
[06:28:17] <SprkDev> Cork, I have a page ready which works fine in PHP. I just need to post the values $_POST['x'], $_POST['y'] $_POST['w'] $_POST['h']. Is this how I post them?
[06:28:33] <Cork> no
[06:28:42] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/Se3wgQku
[06:29:17] <Velveeta> jayjayseakay: i'm not exactly sure what you're asking, but you should start by defining the logic of those various loans in separate functions
[06:29:40] <Cork> SprkDev: that pb quite clearly shows you don't even understand how that code just above you work
[06:29:51] <MalMen> $("#meses").children()[2].attr("valor"); what is wrong with that ?
[06:29:55] <Velveeta> bigbugjava: you would show that div, then use a setTimeout call to delay execution of the rest of your code for 1000ms
[06:30:07] <Cork> MalMen: [] unwraps the element
[06:30:09] <MalMen> <div id="meses"><button valor="1"></button><button valor="2"></button></div>
[06:30:12] <Cork> MalMen: you want .eq()
[06:30:15] <MalMen> hmmm
[06:30:52] <Cork> MalMen: also don't create random attributes outside of data-
[06:30:58] <Cork> it is invalid
[06:31:12] <Cork> <div id="meses"><button data-valor="1"></button><button data-valor="2"></button></div>
[06:31:14] <bigbugjava> Velveeta alright, trying, thanks!
[06:32:22] <SprkDev> But here's the thing, if I am using this code http://pastebin.com/QYFaaYki  do I need all of the from jquery?
[06:32:36] <SprkDev> do I need all of that from jquery?
[06:34:52] <bigbugjava> Velveeta works great
[06:35:04] <Velveeta> bigbugjava: good to hear
[06:50:54] <bigbugjava> Velveeta here mate?

[06:53:26] <bigbugjava> http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/11/14/creative-css-loading-animations/ this page provide some wonderful css animations, the thing is, unlike normal once with display none and block games, to trigger, I cant see the triggers, I downloaded the page. cant see what active and deactive CSS. only if you got a min to look, if not I will manage with what I got so far
[06:57:47] <thrustcore> Hi guys. I have an object that looks like this: "Dec 6, 2013, 9:52:54 PM" -- any easy way to convert it into milliseconds since epoch?
[06:58:18] <Cork> thrustcore: you would have to parse it manually
[06:58:30] <thrustcore> darn, goddamn google charts
[06:58:40] <Cork> if you can get each part into a Date object the rest is fairly easy
[06:58:58] <Cork> but ya, that isn't a format Date supports
[07:02:56] <thrustcore> is this a date object: Fri Dec 06 2013 20:38:50 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)
[07:08:24] <fabioportieri> what could be the possible reasons for an event handler to stop working after an ajax request? (using delegation form with .on() )
[07:11:40] <BinaryKitten> fabioportieri .on doesn't mean you get delegation
[07:12:01] <BinaryKitten> you could be replacing the parent item that's used in delegation
[07:12:15] <BinaryKitten> you could have broken something else
[07:12:26] <BinaryKitten> fabioportieri can you create a jsfiddle or pastebin?
[07:12:26] <fabioportieri> this is delegated, right? $j("#fondoPensioneForm\\:arrowUp").on("mousedown","."+frecciasuClass, function(e) {
[07:12:47] <BinaryKitten> urm \ in id?
[07:13:03] <fabioportieri> BinaryKitten: i'm using a framework so i have to escape the colon in the id
[07:13:10] <fabioportieri> \\:
[07:13:29] <BinaryKitten> \\ = escape the \
[07:13:34] <BinaryKitten> ?
[07:13:54] <fabioportieri> aniway it's not the issue
[07:14:42] <BinaryKitten> fabioportieri ok. but broken ids are possibly the issue
[07:14:55] <fabioportieri> the id stays the same across my ajax requests
[07:15:00] <BinaryKitten> fabioportieri can you create a jsfiddle or pastebin?
[07:15:12] <BinaryKitten> are you replacing that form?
[07:15:22] <fabioportieri> nop
[07:15:24] <BinaryKitten> or that item with that id?
[07:15:34] <fabioportieri> nop, only values
[07:15:37] <BinaryKitten> so that id doesn't appear in the ajax-ed html ?
[07:15:51] <fabioportieri> the ajax itself works fine
[07:16:00] <fabioportieri> but after that, my handlers won't get fired
[07:16:00] <BinaryKitten> right not saying it does
[07:16:08] <BinaryKitten> right not saying it doesn't event
[07:16:15] <fabioportieri> so things must be related
[07:16:23] <BinaryKitten> then there is something in your ajax request or handler
[07:16:33] <BinaryKitten> what are you doing in the ajax request/return?
[07:17:03] <fabioportieri> just updating some model values, not touching dom
[07:17:24] <BinaryKitten> can you pastebin the code
[07:17:36] <BinaryKitten> because something somewhere will be doing something.
[07:17:51] <fabioportieri> the entire code is a lot uhmm
[07:18:00] <BinaryKitten> and while i can guess randomly, without seeing what it does i can't really say much
[07:18:16] <fabioportieri> ok i'll try
[07:18:52] <fabioportieri> woah now it works
[07:19:10] <fabioportieri> i guess the browser used a cached version of it
[07:19:17] <fabioportieri> thanks BinaryKitten
[07:19:25] <BinaryKitten> np
[07:28:47] <P-Alex> Hi Everyone, I wanna start to learn JQuery, what is the best way to start from?
[07:29:57] <DireFog> by reading up on what MVC is, how it works, how to use it, and why it's a good thing
[07:32:40] <FrankDWork> how do you design stuff without the MVC paradigm
[07:32:43] <FrankDWork> youd have to be a bad
[07:33:05] <DireFog> the vast majority of "oh so good" jquery widgets manage
[07:33:23] <DireFog> they look good, but once you look at the implementation… ew
[07:34:07] <DireFog> "lol if I'm writing some ajaxy select box thingy, I don't ever have to care about coherence between underyling input and display lol"
[07:34:11] <dekiss> anyone here have used skrollr?
[07:35:38] <jedimind> dekiss nope
[07:36:36] <BinaryKitten> P-Alex, follow through some tutorials
[07:36:53] <BinaryKitten> P-Alex i think that the better idea is to learn Javascript 1st
[07:37:02] <BinaryKitten> then learning jQuery is a doddle
[07:39:38] <bigbugjava> again me ;0), I'm using this method to switch between pages -> http://jsfiddle.net/SAm8R/5/ , I dont understand why it cause a lot of DOM issues, like everything works after refrash, but if I enter a page and then try something eles from NAV, it doesn't showup.
[07:43:50] <fabioportieri> i'm using some images as background-image.. how do i preload them, to avoid the flicker the first time they are shown?
[07:44:49] <BinaryKitten> var i = new Image(); i.src = "yourimagelocation";
[07:45:12] <fabioportieri> nvm i found some docs
[07:45:22] <BinaryKitten> i believe there is a jQuery plugin that can pre-load background images from css files automatically
[07:45:25] <fabioportieri> BinaryKitten: that's what i would do if they weren't background-image
[07:45:35] <BinaryKitten> fabioportieri it's the same thing
[07:45:52] <BinaryKitten> background-image is just CSS specific way of image handling
[07:45:57] <fabioportieri> mmh diggin into it then
[07:46:24] <wookienz_> hi i have a jquery line like $(td) inside each td is a 3 <a> elements. Only one has a title attribute i am interested in. How do i get the title atrribute element of the first a element? $(td).find("a").attr('title') does not appear to work.
[07:47:29] <BinaryKitten> fabioportieri: http://binarykitten.com/js/371-jquery-image-preloader-update.html
[07:48:31] <fabioportieri> BinaryKitten: nice
[07:48:54] <BinaryKitten> it scans your css as well as giving you a way to just preload a list of images

[07:53:11] <wookienz_> preventdefault
[07:53:12] <wookienz_> ?

[08:10:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you around
[08:12:21] <WebDragon> with something like $("a[href$='.pdf']"), is that automatically case-insensitive ?
[08:12:29] <fosser_josh> how to add delay in jquery?
[08:12:42] <WebDragon> fosser_josh: for like, timeouts ?
[08:12:51] <WebDragon> or just holding things a bit
[08:12:52] <jedimind> .delay()
[08:13:47] <Voting> I'm getting used to building jquery ui user interfaces which are theme-able/re-theme-able. I'm confused. I assumed the theme would provide a base font and font size and I would use EMs to make smaller or larger as I needed on the page. -a- Is this the right channel to ask this question, if not, what is? -b- If I want to do pretty well at re-theme-ing, where should I get the base font and font size from if not from the theme?
[08:14:00] <NoiseEee> fosser_josh: but we're practically required by contract to ask why you think you need to delay your script
[08:14:23] <fosser_josh> WebDragon:  jedimind: i have two $.post() and want to put delay between them. how to use delay() in such condition?
[08:14:45] <NoiseEee> fosser_josh: you have the second one initiated after the first is complete, by using callbacks or promises.
[08:14:53] <NoiseEee> fosser_josh: not delays.
[08:15:10] <WebDragon> yeah, you don't need a timed delay for that. just do the one in a callback after the other succeeds
[08:16:38] <fosser_josh> NoiseEee: WebDragon: how can i do that?
[08:16:49] <fosser_josh> do i need to add in callback and then fire?
[08:17:26] <BinaryKitten> Voting: jquery ui themes only gives themes to its own components. You can acquire these styles by giving your elements the same classes
[08:17:43] <WebDragon> fosser_josh: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+callback+post
[08:17:45] <BinaryKitten> but no, it's not a theme for a site..
[08:17:59] <Voting> BinaryKitten: reading... thinking...
[08:18:12] <WebDragon> so back to my earlier question
[08:18:18] <WebDragon> with something like $("a[href$='.pdf']"), is that automatically case-insensitive ?
[08:18:29] <BinaryKitten> WebDragon no
[08:18:31] <WebDragon> or do I need to specify pdf PDF etc
[08:19:20] <BinaryKitten>  $("a[href$='.pdf'], a[href$='.PDF']")
[08:19:20] <WebDragon> and if so how do I have to do separate [href$=".pdf"], a[href$=".PDF"], etc or can I use a | to separate the values in a single entry
[08:19:28] <Voting> BinaryKitten: I'm not following... I am trying to make my pages very re-theme-able by using jquery ui widgets, not overidding the CSS and by giving my elements the same classes. What should pick the base font and font style?
[08:19:37] <Voting> ooops, font size.
[08:19:55] <BinaryKitten> Voting the base font etc are defined by the base site.
[08:20:05] <BinaryKitten> at least that's my understanding of it
[08:20:14] <Voting> BinaryKitten: From outside the theme?
[08:20:34] <BinaryKitten> yes
[08:20:57] <BinaryKitten> from outside the ui-theme
[08:27:18] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui what up buttercup

[08:33:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> well .map is a good idea

[08:36:43] <joroci> i hate IE day
[08:40:13] <knuth> Anyone an expert on local storage?
[08:40:21] <SprkDev> So I want to send the values there in the alert box to a php file named upload.php as an ajax call. How do I do that? http://jsfiddle.net/UydpR/58/
[08:40:39] <soee> if i have 3 elements with class .foo than what would be the best way to show the one i clicked and hide others if they are visible
[08:42:18] <SprkDev> http://jsfiddle.net/UydpR/59/
[08:42:55] <knuth> I'm no pro but I would make a function to handle it and do the toggleing by id.
[08:43:53] <knuth> I bet though you can cycle though the class and skip by the id you are setting.  But I am lazy and would just hard code myself....
[08:44:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so what you want to do
[08:45:39] <SprkDev> ? anyone?
[08:45:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: unless we can access the native features and modify

[09:05:04] <BillCriswell> SprkDev: What you're passing to data isn't right.
[09:06:11] <SprkDev> how then?
[09:06:47] <BillCriswell> SprkDev: You need to pass it array of objects like [ { name: "xx", value: x }, { name: "yy", value: y } ] or a string like "xx=x&yy=y"

[09:10:05] <dekiss> how can I make background image responsive?
[09:10:09] <Gmac_> but its in a variable and the variable has the word don't
[09:10:15] <grafi> \'
[09:10:19] <Gmac_> and the apostrophe is screwing everything up

[09:11:03] <youngman15> Does anyone know why my jQuery highcharts graph displays perfectly ONLY when my window is resized?
[09:11:49] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: If it's in a variable you don't have to worry about it.. var hasDont = "blah blah don't blah"; console.log( 'foo bar baz ' + hasDont + ' foo foo foo');
[09:12:07] <grafi> smarty pants

[09:13:29] <BillCriswell> dekiss: There's background-size. Not sure how browser support is for it though. Will probably need a polyfill jawn.
[09:13:34] <Gmac_> $foo = "jQuery('.selector').attr('placeholder', '$var'); echo $foo
[09:13:42] <Gmac_> and $var has don't
[09:14:03] <Gmac_> i should first save $var to js var?
[09:17:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: wut?
[09:18:34] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: Ideally $var would escape them fo ryou.
[09:18:51] <Gmac_> but its not
[09:19:48] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: It's sent to the browser broken.
[09:20:21] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: The should run like json_encode($var); to make it safe.
[09:20:53] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: So do like $var = json_encode($var);

[09:30:36] <Gmac_> BillCriswell thank you
[09:31:02] <Krinkle> youngman15: can you share some code / example? e.g. via jsfiddle.ne or codepen.io
[09:31:05] <Krinkle> neg*
[09:31:07] <Krinkle> net*
[09:32:09] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: No problem.
[09:32:41] <youngman15> Krinkle: ok let me try.
[09:43:14] <Guest68122> hu
[09:43:19] <Guest68122> is this valid? $('#task-creation-form').children('form').reset();
[09:43:50] <Guest68122> firefox says TypeError: $(...).children(...).reset is not a function
[09:44:14] <ravigehlot> On mouseover, I can animate my block with opacity: 0.8. What we need is for opacity to look black not grayed out..how can I do that?
[09:44:25] <BillCriswell> Guest68122: jQuery doesn't have a reset, you need to do like .children('form')[0].reset();
[09:45:20] <BillCriswell> .children('form')[0] returns the form itself.
[09:46:06] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: Can you reword that?
[09:46:14] <ravigehlot> sure
[09:46:47] <ravigehlot> I got an image wrapped on a div. I need to mouserover it and see almost like a lightbox inside of that image where I will show white text.
[09:48:05] <ravigehlot> I have .animate() with opacity. I will apply an opacity. If I can only apply that opacity on black...it would look like a lightbox
[09:49:46] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: So you like.. only want the background to be a little transparent?
[09:50:40] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: right...but...black
[09:50:45] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: like a lightbox
[09:50:49] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: or colorbox
[09:55:23] <bigbugjava> I'm using this method to switch between pages -> http://jsfiddle.net/SAm8R/5/ , I dont understand why it cause a lot of DOM issues, like everything works after refrash, but if I enter a page and then try something eles from NAV, it doesn't showup. (Asked it before).
[09:55:54] <youngman15> Krinkle: im having trouble with jsfiddle
[09:56:05] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: I'm sorry still having a hard time following what you're trying to do. Is this at all close? http://jsbin.com/uQILUSOY/1/edit?html,css,output
[09:56:08] <youngman15> Krinkle: idk how to represent what i have exactly
[09:56:14] <bigbugjava> Note that preventDefault does not help
[09:56:56] <Krinkle> youngman15: Just copy the plugin in there, and the code you use to trigger it? If you can't abstract the issue, it's going to be impossible for us to do it for you most likely.
[09:59:56] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/uQILUSOY/2/edit
[10:02:45] <youngman15> Krinkle: in my ruby on rails app, here is my highcharts code: http://jsfiddle.net/sKZty/
[10:03:24] <BillCriswell_> ravigehlot: Ok. What are you tyring to do there again? I was disconnected.
[10:04:15] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell_: mouseover, it will gray out ....we need it to look like a lightbox instead...blaack
[10:05:48] <youngman15> Krinkle: when i set the width to 100% and height to auto, the chart displays perfectly ONLY on resize, but when I set the width to some pixel number, and the height to some pixel number, the chart display perfectly.
[10:06:14] <youngman15> Krinkle: by resize, I mean window resize.
[10:07:44] <youngman15> Krinkle: the chart displays perfectly without the window resize when using a pixel number for width and height
[10:10:47] <Krinkle> youngman15: I don't think the problem is in the code you're showing me. If it is, it is too abstracted. Maybe someone else is willing to dig through it though, but I can't at the moment.
[10:11:12] <youngman15> Krinkle: ok thats fine. thanks
[10:11:45] <Krinkle> For starters, include the jquery.highcharts.js file, and avoid using haml/coffeescript, unless you can make it run in the pastebin (codepen.io supports those)
[10:12:10] <Krinkle> so that you can point out to someone here what goes wrong, and can work towards fixing it :)
[10:15:24] <youngman15> thanks Krinkle
[10:17:22] <BillCriswell_> Which one seems more correct to you guys for styling a :before and :after on hover? a:after:hover or a:hover:after ?

[10:40:17] <mdhopkins> hi, have to inject inline jquery into a site that loads the script in the footer. even waiting for ready, I get $ is not defined. what's the right way to let that footer include happen before my inline script is evaluated?
[10:40:31] <krambiorix> i have some generated jquery code that i can retrieve via ajax... How do i include it in the script?
[10:43:58] <funkwarrior> mdhopkins: do you use document.ready?
[10:44:14] <mdhopkins> funkwarrior: no, am using $(function() { ...
[10:45:14] <funkwarrior> mdhopkins: check http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[10:45:36] <shoky> $(function() { ..   is document.ready
[10:50:02] <jsc802> is it faster to push a bunch of elements into an array and then joining it and inserting it into an .html()?
[10:50:14] <jsc802> faster than doing them one at a time i mean
[10:52:43] <shoky> jsc802 yes it's faster than appending to the DOM one by one

[11:12:31] <shoky> who has been told how to ask a question a million times already
[11:12:38] <Zzaichik> lol
[11:13:09] <Bloomberg> Oh my God!!
[11:13:26] <Zzaichik> glob
[11:14:09] <Bloomberg> I believe this forum is for to makes the question the people don't know
[11:14:26] <shoky> this forum is not for "someone can help me?" questions
[11:14:46] <shoky> jsfiddle + problem description. no more
[11:15:04] <Zzaichik> ^^
[11:16:28] <jedimind> Bloomberg is the textbook definition of a support vampire
[11:16:52] <shoky> he's a polite one, at least
[11:17:06] <Bloomberg> uishshs
[11:17:09] <shoky> even tho i just said he's rude.
[11:17:10] <Bloomberg> What I did?
[11:17:22] <obert> window.location.hash is jquery?
[11:17:26] <jedimind> polite does not excuse blatant disregard for anyone but themselves
[11:17:38] <BillCriswell_> obert: No.
[11:17:42] <Bloomberg> All people here is fight to me!
[11:17:48] <Bloomberg> S.O.S
[11:18:04] <shoky> Bloomberg: we're just annoyed that you dont ask the damn question, and dance around it, and expect us to dance with you
[11:18:24] <BillCriswell_> and shoky is a terrible dancer.
[11:18:29] <jedimind> he's been doing it for weeks and months now
[11:18:33] <jedimind> every single day i tell him to create a test case
[11:18:39] <jedimind> just that, basic thing, he's incapable of doing
[11:18:48] <jedimind> and yet comes in here every single goddamn day begging for help in the same manner
[11:18:53] <jedimind> praying on people who dont know any better

[11:19:55] <BillCriswell_> I just had to charge my Kindle for the first time like.. ever.
[11:20:13] <BillCriswell_> I wish my phone had the same battery life.
[11:20:57] <shoky> my phone had awesome battery life until the kitkat upgrade :\
[11:21:18] <shoky> hate kitkat
[11:22:19] <BillCriswell_> shoky: My paperwhite hasn't needed a charge in like... 2 months maybe?
[11:22:53] <shoky> how does that work
[11:23:19] <BillCriswell_> shoky: Like.. 1 shit load of science probably.

[11:28:19] <shoky> oh. no wifi and only 30 mins a day.. okeydoke
[11:28:37] <shoky> i can't find any technical specs about the battery
[11:29:25] <BillCriswell_> I don't use it every day, mostly just during the week on the train and I never have the backlight on.
[11:29:40] <BillCriswell_> shoky: I guess since it's eink or whatever? I dunno. Hardware was never really my thing.

[11:38:05] <BillCriswell_> Yes.
[11:38:05] <shoky> i was stuck with the timeport

[11:41:49] <BillCriswell_> http://www.geekcode.com/geek.html can't believe I went through the trouble of doing this in the past.
[11:43:04] <grafi> just do it already Rohan_Bhangui ^^
[11:43:09] <grafi> but do a good job
[11:43:10] <grafi> :P

[11:43:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[11:45:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> gonna take me a few days exmas :(
[11:50:15] <petey> Is there a reason you'd call .css first and then animate the same attribute right afterwards?
[11:50:29] <petey> $("#news-events").css("left",offset * 2 + "px")
[11:50:29] <petey>         $("#news-events").animate({ left: offset  + "px" })
[11:55:13] <BillCriswell_> petey: I guess they wanted to make sure #news-events is where it should be? Seems weird to me. Does the .css() call change the position of the element visibly?
[11:55:27] <petey> Yes
[11:55:47] <petey> it seems to work, but why call .css AND .animate? Could it be a fallback thing?
[11:58:10] <BillCriswell_> petey: I dunno? If you take it out does it break anything?
[12:03:02] <petey> billcriswell, doesnt look like it, lol
[12:03:08] <petey> billcriswell_ *
[12:04:21] <BillCriswell_> Shit like that always scares me. I always thing there's some special edgecase where it's necessary and if you take it out someone will die.
[12:04:33] <shoky> wat
[12:04:41] <shoky> of course it makes sense to call .css first, then animate
[12:04:54] <shoky> you set the initial property to where you want it to be.. and then animate it
[12:06:26] <shoky> well i guess i see your point, if it was supposed to be there already
[12:07:56] <shoky> ignore me
[12:15:59] <BillCriswell> Ugh. I had a joke and I was disconnected.

[12:30:14] <Ortund> Can anyone explain to me why line 6 of this doesn't seem to be reading as a string? http://jsfiddle.net/fR9d6/
[12:30:28] <Ortund> note, this code is in a js file
[12:32:38] <grafi> looks like a little nightmare
[12:32:39] <grafi> :S
[12:32:58] <Ortund> how else would it be done?
[12:33:38] <Ortund> in this the plugin file generates the markup based on the options in use
[12:34:10] <grafi> sure, this might be the only way to do it then
[12:34:25] <grafi> its still not nice though
[12:35:58] <Ortund> okay but why is line 6 not reading as a string? it's like everything's just floating there on that line from the <script> tag...
[12:37:25] <grafi> looks like a string to me?
[12:37:48] <Ortund> it's giving "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier "
[12:38:30] <Ortund> oh for five snakes
[12:38:38] <Ortund> it's just me being an idiot... nevermind
[12:39:24] <BillCriswell> Isn't it Christ's sake?

[12:48:22] <bladeee> but I have the form with the id "busCreate" under it
[12:48:33] <bladeee> it will not execute the jquery unless I put the script under the form
[12:48:35] <bladeee> any help?
[12:49:41] <grafi> bladeee $(document).ready(function() { /*your code here*/ }); or put the code at the bottom of the page
[12:50:30] <bladeee> grafi: didn't work
[12:50:43] <bladeee> I know there is a way to put it at the top
[12:50:47] <bladeee> plenty of sites do it
[12:51:20] <grafi> and its called document ready
[12:51:41] <grafi> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[12:52:21] <Ortund> what's it matter where in the page the code goes? personally I prefer putting it at the bottom anyway
[12:52:48] <grafi> well it does matter in certain cases
[12:53:12] <grafi> i think there are benefits to having jquery in the head and such
[12:53:30] <kegster> is there a way to easily allow users to "drag" one div from one container to another? basically i want to only allow swapping between the 2 containers, and ONLY allow a specific div to be grabbed/selected
[12:58:54] <BillCriswell> I am not looking forward to designing sites to look good on  a watch.
[13:00:47] <kegster> is this done with .draggable(), .droppable() and .sortable() ?
[13:01:00] <kegster> or am i looking @ wrong method
[13:02:42] <BillCriswell> watches*
[13:02:43] <BillCriswell> Phones were exciting.. watch... nah.
[13:05:16] <grafi> phones are the devil

[13:05:29] <BillCriswell> At least a lot of people have them.
[13:05:35] <BillCriswell> I'll never wear a watch.
[13:10:36] <grafi> because you have a phone
[13:10:40] <grafi> gotcha ^^
[13:13:45] <BillCriswell> Honestly... I'd carry around one of those pocket watches or whatever before a wrist watch.
[13:14:32] <BillCriswell> Jewelry, watches, whatever... just not for me.

[13:44:45] <funkwarrior> Hello, during $('#mydiv).fadeIn() and $('#mydiv).fadeout() functions the child elements of #mydiv, which are floated, doesn't stay in their place; their obviously floating inside the growing #mydiv. Any suggestion?
[13:45:29] <funkwarrior> *edit: any suggestion to not make their float during the parent animation?
[13:50:44] <LakWork> semi-advanced... I want to define a new event type of 'xclick' which acts as a proxy and binds a different event name to the handler defined against xclick
[13:51:25] <LakWork> i'm attempting to define jquery.event.special.xclick to do this, but i'm not sure how to construct it
[13:57:35] <bnason> I have a div with position: fixed and right: 20px; that i've made .resizable() with handles on the top and left. However it seems to want to anchor the div to the left of the window. is there anyway around that?
[14:04:49] <bnason> well, this is one fix: .on('resize', function(event) { $(this).css('left', ''); });
[14:04:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: lol
[14:04:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> old school much?
[14:12:26] <Ortund> do I use .text() or .val() to get the content of a <p> ?
[14:12:42] <duch_kazatel> if you want the text, use .text();
[14:13:35] <duch_kazatel> .val() is more meant for forms.
[14:24:48] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong?! $('.code_20_28').addClass('check_error');  -> no class added
[15:02:20] <Jon47> krambiorix: did your selector match any elements?
[15:09:32] <jabo_> hi
[15:10:12] <jabo_> is it faster to select div#uniqueid123 than #uniqueid123
[15:10:29] <jabo_> considering the page will have about 5,00 unique ids
[15:10:33] <jabo_> 5000
[15:31:57] <raj> anyone familiar with this function in jquery-ui? http://paste.ofcode.org/rKMtyMGnNpJPvrU2qppREh

[15:40:40] <rn10950> Is there any way to detect when an iframe starts loading?
[15:42:24] <duch_kazatel> rn10950 when the src attribute is set.
[15:43:48] <rn10950> no there is a pre set source attribute in HTML. i am making a netscape emulator and i need to change the gif file in the header when the page starts and stops loading. any ideas?
[15:45:10] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement - this should have what you need.
[15:49:57] <shoky> raj that's just the generic widget bridge function
[15:50:29] <shoky> raj: any calls to jqui widget methods will go through it
[15:58:49] <raj> aah, I see
[15:58:59] <raj> it's called a gagillion times
[15:59:09] <raj> what's a widget bridge?
[16:04:01] <raj> ahh, this is good http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-use-the-widget-bridge-in-the-widget-factory
[16:04:19] <raj> always making me smarter, thanks shoky
[16:05:13] <shoky> well actually that function isn't the "widget bridge" but yea it's called for every method
[16:07:27] <raj> I know I brought this up in here before, but can the slider handles (for a range slider) work intuitively to allow sliding in either direction when the handles are on top of one another? http://jsfiddle.net/AS4yA/
[16:08:02] <raj> it's silly to have to move one slider out of the way to grab the other slider to move in the opposite direction
[16:12:53] <shoky> doubts
[16:13:01] <raj> I'm sure someone must have posted about this on the internets before, just don't know a search query to pull it up
[16:47:16] <furry_monkey> Hi there, Can someone tell me how I can select an input which is inside a div which is clicked. http://pastebin.com/jEwLDhpb
[16:48:04] <duch_kazatel> furry_monkey do you have a fiddle instead?
[16:50:16] <furry_monkey> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/yLxbW/1/ but the code doesn't do much
[16:51:35] <duch_kazatel> furry_monkey let's get it running first.  one sec.
[16:51:49] <furry_monkey> ok thanks :)
[16:56:52] <duch_kazatel> furry_monkey part of the problem is you've got an incomplete code example, but if you really just want the checkbox inside of the clicked ".main_street", you can do something like clickedBoxInput = $(this).find('input[type="checkbox"]')
[16:57:45] <furry_monkey> Hi duch_kazatel, thanks for the info. I'll give this a go.
[17:05:22] <furry_monkey> duch_kazate that works perfectly! thanks for the help
[17:06:33] <duch_kazatel> furry_monkey sure.

[17:46:42] <shoky> what an annoying page that is

[17:52:53] <duch_kazatel> yodawerd http://jsfiddle.net/M3BeL/1/
[17:53:01] <duch_kazatel> didn't even really check my work - does that work?
[17:53:12] <shoky> yodawerd: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/M3BeL/2/
[17:53:12] <shoky> watch out for whitespace
[17:53:30] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah, that too.
[17:53:49] <yodawerd> yeah i just realized my input value was garbage... but cant see why.. ffff thanks

[18:12:57] <shoky> $('.mydiv').remove()
[18:13:32] <newbe> I tried this but doesn't seems to work
[18:13:41] <shoky> then make a jsfiddle

[18:14:01] <Wayneman> any suggestions for how to secure an ajax login?
[18:15:00] <Wayneman> I guess SSL is the way to go?
[18:15:26] <ermadd> yep good start else its can be sniffed
[18:15:29] <shoky> yeah.. not really a jquery question.
[18:15:42] <shoky> but uh.. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Application_Security_FAQ
[18:15:53] <shoky> those are all good suggestions there
[18:15:54] <Wayneman> well, I'm using jquery for the ajax, so thought some of you may have run into similar situations
[18:16:19] <Wayneman> those look like good links, thanks
[18:17:08] <shoky> plenty more info on owasp.org
[18:17:26] <shoky> web-security related, that is
[18:44:01] <Wayneman> lots of ins and outs, but not much chat
[18:44:38] <Wayneman> $(this).chat() = true;
[18:45:01] <Wayneman> yikes, I think that has a syntax error
[18:45:44] <Velveeta> $(this).talk({ size: 'small' });
[18:45:54] <Wayneman> :)
[18:46:11] <yodawerd> is it possible to find all properties of an object that start with a specific string... i.e. myObj['imageId'*] or something
[18:46:49] <yodawerd> so that myObj.imageIds and myObj.imageIdss could be selected
[18:48:12] <Velveeta> yodawerd: you'd have to iterate over the properties and match them individually against a String.indexOf or a regular expression
[18:48:31] <yodawerd> does underscore have anything that could help out
[18:48:46] <Velveeta> i don't think so, not for a partial string match of a property like that
[18:48:49] <Wayneman> I was thinking regular expression too
[18:50:04] <dcherman> yodawerd: use _.filter, return key.indexoOf( "imageId" ) === 0
[18:58:01] <yodawerd>     var check = _.filter(params, function(key) {
[18:58:02] <yodawerd>         return key.indexOf('imageIds') === 0;
[18:58:02] <yodawerd>     });
[18:58:14] <yodawerd> dcherman: it is returning an empty array
[18:58:33] <yodawerd> {  title: 'fsdfsd',
[18:58:33] <yodawerd>   titleZh: 'fsdfsd',
[18:58:33] <yodawerd>   body: 'fsdf',
[18:58:35] <yodawerd>   bodyZh: 'sdfsdf',
[18:58:37] <yodawerd>   imageIds: '/uploads/tmp/image-3.png,/uploads/tmp/image-4.png',
[18:58:39] <yodawerd>   imageIdsZh: '' }
[18:58:56] <vinex08> can anyone point a good tutorial link in learning jQuery?
[18:59:03] <yodawerd> urggh nasty paste
[18:59:08] <vinex08> right now im watching the 30 day tuts
[18:59:20] <vinex08> by tutsplus
[19:00:33] <dcherman> yodawerd: that's because you're not using _.filter correctly - read the docs  for filter and look at the callback that you're providing and it should stand out.
[19:05:01] <Wayneman> thx for the help everyone
