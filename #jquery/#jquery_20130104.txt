[00:00:18] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/26/ see it fails
[00:00:30] <_sCoRpi> i made your 1st example look like the 2nd one
[00:00:38] <_sCoRpi> it only fails because you didn't change more of your css
[00:00:56] <_sCoRpi> wait
[00:01:02] <Whiskey> what parrt have i miss
[00:01:08] <raj> ajpiano, ping
[00:01:15] <_sCoRpi> do you _always_ need the things to be in a single line?
[00:01:21] <_sCoRpi> so line breaks cannot occur?
[00:01:57] <_sCoRpi> if that's the case then well it's kind of broken by design because it will lead to "inifinitely" long lines if somebody wants that
[00:02:34] <Whiskey> not sure what you mean
[00:02:47] <_sCoRpi> you are complaining about the line break
[00:02:47] <Whiskey> it depends on the jquery that makes it work
[00:03:21] <_sCoRpi> but you never stated that line breaks are forbidden, you only wanted the columns to be the same size
[00:03:24] <_sCoRpi> and  they are the same size now
[00:03:56] <_sCoRpi> if you'd paint a bigger picture, really showing a real world case for this, i might be able to understand better what you are actually looking for
[00:04:28] <Whiskey> its need to get width from the box in javascript thats the only way to make the lines symetic and not break
[00:05:42] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: the question was why you don't want linebreaks
[00:05:43] <voot545> can a cookie set via http header be removed by a browser script?
[00:05:57] <_sCoRpi> like i said: that way you are allowing inifitely long lines
[00:06:06] <_sCoRpi> which will most likely break any design
[00:06:22] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/27/ <-- that donÂ´t break same line
[00:06:36] <Whiskey> but know the rows are bigger then the boxsize
[00:08:02] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: you still didn't answer my questions
[00:08:26] <Whiskey> what was it?
[00:08:37] <Whiskey> I tell you that everythings depends on the javasript
[00:08:55] <Whiskey> thats why the InfoViewBox need to be compared in the javascript whit the width of th rows
[00:09:27] <Whiskey> Cuz linebreaks are uggly
[00:09:32] <_sCoRpi> sorry, but if you cannot even answer my questions i really don#t want to put more time into this. i'm not repeating myself like 50 imes
[00:09:33] <_sCoRpi> times
[00:13:42] <Whiskey> i did answer it

[00:14:11] <Whiskey> [_sCoRpi] Whiskey: the question was why you don't want linebreaks <--- its uggly
[00:16:34] <Whiskey> is not that an answer _sCoRpi?
[00:16:57] <_sCoRpi> it is, but i am at work now - i might have time later
[00:19:33] <Whiskey> :)
[00:33:39] <jejrj> i have this code http://pastie.org/5620250 and I want to add a delay time before the window reloads (line #3). how should I approach this? using jquery's .delay() ?
[00:42:07] <boulet101010> window.location.reload().delay(time);
[00:42:18] <boulet101010> may work
[00:49:55] <boulet101010> jeraldv, window.setTimeout(window.location.reload, 1000);
[00:53:46] <jejrj> boulet101010: I get Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[00:57:12] <fRAiLtY-> If jQuery('#order_attachments_grid input[type="file"]'); returns 2 values, both different, how do I only "get" the first
[01:01:06] <boulet101010> jejrj, on jsfiddle?
[01:01:25] <_sCoRpi> frAiLtY-: select the first field with the [0]
[01:01:33] <untaken> How do I create a trigger on a change on *any* checkbox on my page? Rather than on a individual checkbox, I want logic to determine any? Is this possible?
[01:01:39] <_sCoRpi> -the
[01:01:59] <fRAiLtY-> _sCoRpi:  How?  Can you give an example of where to place the [0] ?
[01:02:20] <fRAiLtY-> i tried .first() but whilst it did only select the first it doesn't seem to log the change event
[01:02:36] <untaken> is it $(':checkbox')  ?
[01:02:43] <_sCoRpi> .first() should work fine
[01:03:00] <_sCoRpi> [0]  would actually only return the html element
[01:03:20] <fRAiLtY-> _sCoRpi:  I'm trying to determine when a file input box is modified in anyway, i.e. "Choose file" I have the input element and tried .change() and .click() but nothing :x
[01:03:23] <_sCoRpi> .first() returns a collection so you can continue to work with it without having to create a new one (if i'm correct)
[01:04:18] <fRAiLtY-> ^^
[01:05:37] <_sCoRpi> fRAiLtY-: I'd have to check that specifically, but no time for that atm
[01:05:51] <fRAiLtY-> _sCoRpi:  Can you just tell me what syntax to use [0]
[01:06:13] <_sCoRpi> jQuery('#order_attachments_grid input[type="file"]')[0]
[01:06:21] <_sCoRpi> but that will return the raw html node
[01:06:25] <untaken> Is there a way to find out all the checkboxes that are ticked on a page, so I can loop around them as I need?
[01:06:32] <_sCoRpi> so you are better off with .first()
[01:07:36] <_sCoRpi> untaken: did you try $('input[type=checkbox]:checked')?
[01:13:59] <jejrj> boulet101010: it's coffeescript..
[01:17:42] <untaken> _sCoRpi: thanks, that worked :)
[01:27:19] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: this example not working http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/34/
[01:27:46] <Whiskey> but it works on my webserver, its thet size you get from the buttom it shuld get for the rows
[01:29:40] <jejrj> this is it http://pastie.org/5620392
[01:29:44] <jejrj> am i doing something wrong

[01:36:49] <Whiskey> stkrzysiak: ?
[01:38:31] <farid> I have a <ul id="nav_sub"> li <ul class="submenu"> li..........Now using the jquery I would like to remove the class="submenu" ........ any suggestion
[01:42:06] <untaken> jQuery("input:checked").length;   < that command contains how many checkboxes are checked, but how can I loop around these? Can I do something like for  for( var i=0; jQuery("input:checked").length ;i++ ) {  ??some how access each object?? }
[01:42:51] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/tGxMW/
[01:43:34] <akl_> @untaken, use Jquery each method: untaken
[01:43:40] <akl_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[01:44:01] <untaken> akl_: I'll take a look. Thank you
[01:44:14] <aqeel> everything works... but this, if at the bottom of the page it jumps to top of page and starts scrolling how to make it take the height of the scrollable container and scroll reverse and not jump to start
[01:45:35] <aqeel> a.scrollTop("scrollHeight") this need to be the end of container and scroll reverse from bottom and not jump top top of page
[01:45:51] <aqeel> to top*
[01:58:28] <DerZauberer> hey ppl
[01:58:43] <DerZauberer> I'm working with jquery modal boxes right now
[01:59:34] <DerZauberer> can I somehow stop loading the link that my a href points on when I use the same for the modal box?
[01:59:58] <DerZauberer> like if js is enabled, the modal box shows up and the link won't load
[02:00:15] <DerZauberer> but if js is disabled, it will fallback to my a href link
[02:03:12] <_sCoRpi> DerZauberer: e.preventDefault() ?
[02:03:19] <_sCoRpi> for the click-event on your link
[02:03:48] <DerZauberer> ah, thanks
[02:03:54] <_sCoRpi> das sollte ein Zauberer aber wissen :P
[02:04:07] <DerZauberer> ich bin eben kein allwissender zauberer :P
[02:04:40] <DerZauberer> und ich dachte dass sowas vll schon im modal als option eingebaut wÃ¤re...
[02:05:31] <_sCoRpi> ich nutze das nicht ;)
[02:06:30] <DerZauberer> achso
[02:08:24] <DerZauberer> ich nutze sonst mootools ;)
[02:08:26] <DerZauberer> und moo ui
[02:26:17] <Anticom> hi all
[02:26:25] <Anticom> is there a way to get the full document height?
[02:26:37] <Anticom> $(document).height() is just giving me the window's height :/
[02:30:56] <_sCoRpi> Anticom: document should work fine. but if you have no scrollbars the height will be the same as the window
[02:31:35] <_sCoRpi> Anticom: you could use body to get the actual height if it's less than the window
[02:32:44] <Anticom> no, the document is bigger than the window
[02:32:46] <Anticom> wait a sec
[02:33:10] <Anticom> lol?!
[02:33:15] <Anticom> in jsfiddle it works ._. http://jsfiddle.net/EdNjc/
[02:33:16] <_sCoRpi> "now it's working fine"
[02:33:51] <Whiskey> :P
[02:34:34] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: your problem is more complex, still no time for that
[02:34:43] <_sCoRpi> cause i have to dig into that
[02:35:06] <drupol> Hi all
[02:35:19] <drupol> I'm looking for a way to sort multidimensionnal array, see: http://jsbin.com/oxeyut/1/edit
[02:36:04] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: np i just did a :P :)
[02:36:09] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, http://jsfiddle.net/q8uU2/3/ I need to hide the Test button when NO checkboxes are selected, and show it when ANY checkboxes are selected. It almost works but when a checkbox is de-selected even if 1 remains selected the button goes
[02:36:23] <Whiskey> anyways did mange to fix a a working example for you http://tinkerbin.com/CMe9BnLz
[02:42:13] <_sCoRpi> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/q8uU2/4/ - just a quick fix probably not the best performance-wise
[02:43:06] <fRAiLtY-> Most instances will only have a maximum of 2 checkboxes, some may have 3 or 4, I just did 6 as a test. What are the performance implications?
[02:43:17] <_sCoRpi> a bit better would already be to have a boolean before the each and then just call hide or show just once
[02:43:19] <_sCoRpi> wait i'll update
[02:44:46] <_sCoRpi> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/q8uU2/5/

[03:10:29] <Kasimir> Any of you guys know any solid jquery full screen gallery cores?
[03:10:50] <Kasimir> or should I just go with a custom build one?
[03:59:09] <eshlox> http://wklej.org/id/914183/ it's possible to change endpoint with jquery without using function inside fineUploader?
[04:26:19] <beepbeep_> What am I doing wrong here, this function always returns null :( https://gist.github.com/4452259
[04:28:22] <NodeX> ajax is async
[04:28:40] <NodeX> which means it will fire and forget then continue with your function
[04:28:48] <noregret> beepbeep_: console.log(val) in there and see what might it has if you're using one call, ie
[04:28:48] <NodeX> (the var is never changed)
[04:29:23] <beepbeep_> NodeX, I'm having trouble understanding, can you explain again? :p
[04:29:54] <NodeX> the "A" of "ajax" means "asynchronous" which means it fires the request then continues
[04:30:01] <NodeX> it doesnt wait for a response
[04:30:32] <NodeX> basically no matter what your request does to that var it will return it's original value becuase it's not touched by the ajax request
[04:30:44] <beepbeep_> oic
[04:30:49] <beepbeep_> I get that
[04:30:52] <NodeX> well it is touched but not in the scope
[04:31:03] <beepbeep_> it'll return the var before success touches it?
[04:31:42] <untaken> is there away to have a checkbox disabled, but still show as ticked?
[04:32:13] <NodeX> correct
[04:32:19] <beepbeep_> totally makes sense.
[04:32:27] <beepbeep_> thx for explaining!
[04:32:38] <NodeX> there is a few options to get round this...
[04:32:53] <NodeX> 1. wrap your function in the success method
[04:33:03] <NodeX> 2. use a promise()
[04:33:18] <NodeX> 3. (unwise as this blocks the UI) use a synchronous request
[04:33:37] <beepbeep_> Can you further explain 1. ?
[04:33:51] <beepbeep_> I tried returning in the success method
[04:33:57] <beepbeep_> but that doesn't help either.
[04:34:10] <NodeX> infact promise() is wrong my mistake
[04:35:20] <NodeX> your function should fire the request, then call another function or soemhting after it
[04:35:37] <NodeX> think of it as writing your method in reverse
[04:35:50] <beepbeep_> Hmmm
[04:35:57] <beepbeep_> Don't think I'm following.
[04:36:10] <NodeX> success : function(foo) {....... someOtherFunction(YOUR_VAR); });
[04:36:42] <beepbeep_> I see
[04:39:37] <beepbeep_> NodeX, how would you approach this scenario. On change of a certain select, I need to retrieve some a boolean value, if that boolean is true, I retrieve more info.
[04:39:57] <NodeX> I would do it in the way above
[04:40:44] <NodeX> there is a done() function but I am not sure what it inherits
[04:40:50] <beepbeep_> It worked at first because this boolean only had to be used once and I handled all logic in success method.
[04:41:01] <beepbeep_> but now I have to reuse the boolean, which is how I started messing around
[04:41:07] <NodeX> :/
[04:41:36] <NodeX> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-return-from-ajax-done
[04:41:43] <NodeX> perhaps something on there can shed some light
[04:42:44] <shoky> all that link says is to use async:false :\
[04:42:46] <beepbeep_> I could set async to false and use done method it seems.
[04:42:53] <shoky> no dont set async to false
[04:43:10] <shoky> beepbeep_:  http://pastie.org/5620945
[04:43:28] <beepbeep_> thx shoky
[04:43:54] <NodeX> be careful with that
[04:44:06] <NodeX> that will block the UI so nothing can be done while it's happening
[04:44:21] <NodeX> if your request times out the UI could be blocked for that timeout value
[04:45:10] <beepbeep_> hmzz, explain? this seems like a cool approach.
[04:46:22] <NodeX> I did explain
[04:46:39] <NodeX> synchronous ajax requests BLOCK the UI (screen)
[04:49:44] <beepbeep_> NodeX, how is Shoky his solution synchronous?
[04:50:05] <NodeX> I dont know what his solution is because he is ignored by me for being an idiot
[04:50:14] <shoky> beepbeep_ it's not synchronous
[04:50:15] <NodeX> and I can't see what he;s typing
[04:52:00] <anli__> Can I clone just a directory, or does it have to be a repo?
[04:52:17] <gry> the latter
[04:52:20] <anli__> ok
[04:52:29] <anli__> thx
[04:57:13] <nFFF> beepbeep_, shoky's example is the most elegant way to do what you want, whenever you want to use the reponse of a request later on in your code, you should always use defferreds, you rarely/never want to make the call non async
[04:57:16] <nFFF> ?defferred
[04:57:21] <nFFF> ?deferred
[05:06:09] <mbn_18> Hi, when I  use clone() to copy an <li> to another location the $('#new_list li').click() on it does not working. If I use clone(true), the $('#old_list li').click() work but not the new. Any idea?
[05:11:20] <shoky> mbn_18:  you probably want to use event delegation instead. delegate the event handling to each list with .on()  e.g.:  $('#old_list').on('click', 'li', function() { ... })
[05:11:25] <shoky> and same with #new_list
[05:11:37] <shoky> see http://api.jquery.com/on/  especially about 'event delegation'
[05:12:25] <mbn_18> shoky: thx
[05:13:00] <shoky> this way you set event handlers on each list,  instead of on each single <li>
[05:13:19] <shoky> (but it will only catch those events that bubbled up from an <li> )
[05:13:53] <mbn_18> shoky: not sure I understand. will first try it
[05:14:02] <shoky> first read about it.
[05:14:44] <mbn_18> shoky: yea, doing that
[05:15:34] <shoky> mbn_18: $('#new_list li').click(fn)  means:  find '#new_list li' elements that are in the dom right now. it won't do shit for <li> elements that you add to #new_list later
[05:16:20] <mbn_18> shoky: Yea, I start to understand that
[05:22:13] <Whiskey> shoky: :D
[05:31:28] <shoky> hi Whiskey
[05:33:26] <One-Man-Bucket> can jquery fetch queryparameters from the url?
[05:33:30] <One-Man-Bucket> ?id=asdf
[05:34:32] <Whiskey> shokey http://tinkerbin.com/CMe9BnLz <-- an example of what i mean but you need to take run before it show proper
[05:36:31] <seutje> One-Man-Bucket: jquery doesn't have any methods specific for query param handling
[05:36:41] <seutje> but hey, it's just plain text
[05:36:53] <beepbeep_> shoky: using your way to deal with request and response https://gist.github.com/4452633 I get following error: "TypeError: sendIsShipRequest(...) is undefined", while it definitely is not undefined, any idea?
[05:37:44] <Whiskey> seutje: :D
[05:37:44] <beepbeep_> When I use firebug and hover over the line that gives the error, I can see that sendIsShipRequest points to the correct function
[05:37:47] <shoky> beepbeep_:  it's undefined at the scope/time you're calling it.. can't help without seeing more
[05:38:04] <beepbeep_> shoky, sec, I'll paste code.
[05:39:53] <beepbeep_> shoky: https://gist.github.com/4452656
[05:40:16] <shoky> beepbeep_  you  need to return $.ajax
[05:40:18] <shoky> not just run it
[05:40:24] <shoky> look at my paste again
[05:40:37] <shoky> ehh
[05:40:40] <shoky> you're still doing things wrong
[05:41:27] <shoky> beepbeep_: when i wrote  '// do something with response'  in my paste,  that means DO SOMETHING. not just set a variable in order to do something with it elsewhere
[05:41:43] <shoky> in the callback, do whatever you want there
[05:43:03] <shoky> beepbeep_: for example, DO SOMETHING could mean send another request, as you said you wanna do.
[05:43:11] <beepbeep_> okay
[05:43:57] <beepbeep_> But how is saving the data in a var not doing something? :p
[05:44:09] <shoky> :\
[05:44:22] <shoky> because you wnat to do something with that var RIGHT AWAY
[05:44:34] <shoky> right when the repsonse has arrived, you already wanna do something, right?
[05:44:40] <shoky> you said so yourself :\
[05:45:02] <shoky> or i'll ask another way:  how is saving the data in a var doing something? :p
[05:45:28] <beepbeep_> Well it's not doing nothing, so it's doing something =D
[05:45:44] <shoky> with no effect on anything ?
[05:45:48] <shoky> = nothing
[05:45:59] <shoky> effect on a variable doesn't count.
[05:46:53] <beepbeep_> sec, refactoring! :)Ã 
[05:46:59] <shoky> oh boy
[05:47:50] <fabioportieri> hello guys
[05:48:26] <Whiskey> shoky: did you check
[05:48:37] <shoky> Whiskey check what
[05:48:51] <Whiskey> my link
[05:49:07] <shoky> oh. you didnt say my nick right so it didnt hightlight
[05:49:18] <Whiskey> oo :/&6
[05:49:37] <shoky> eh, why tinkerbin
[05:49:46] <shoky> doesnt let you resize
[05:50:08] <beepbeep_> thx for help shoky, fixed it now :)
[05:50:20] <shoky> Whiskey:  sorry, i'm done helping you with that
[05:50:36] <shoky> np beepbeep_
[05:51:47] <Whiskey> shoky: it did not work in fiddle of some reason
[05:54:26] <shoky> Whiskey: ok.. i'm done not coz of tinkerbin :P
[05:54:44] <Whiskey> yeh i did get that
[05:55:09] <Whiskey> but you did get that your slotion failed yesterday
[05:55:42] <shoky> no, i did get that you didn't tell me what behaviour you're looking for
[05:55:58] <shoky> just like now.
[05:56:20] <shoky> and you keep totally changing my solutions into things i told you i don't care to bother with
[05:56:33] <shoky> and then you want me to solve that..
[05:56:37] <Whiskey> hehe no i dont :)
[05:56:38] <Whiskey> i try to make it work
[05:56:44] <shoky> without properly saying what you actually want it to do
[05:56:52] <shoky> you just keep pointing and saying "it fails"
[05:57:46] <Whiskey> ;/
[05:59:05] <Whiskey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/37/ your example
[05:59:47] <shoky> there you go again..
[05:59:49] <Whiskey> wtf i have no clue what im talking about now :/
[06:00:25] <Whiskey> hehe yeh you see first box not have same size as the others
[06:00:29] <Whiskey> cuz it wonÂ´t know if its to small
[06:00:31] <shoky> also the biggest problem with you
[06:00:38] <shoky> is that you're not here looking for help, at all
[06:00:45] <shoky> you're here to get people to do shit for you
[06:01:53] <Whiskey> well depends on how you see on it :/
[06:01:57] <shoky> not really
[06:02:02] <shoky> you said yourself you dont care to learn
[06:02:05] <shoky> yesterday
[06:03:19] <Whiskey> well yeh i have never played whit jquery/js how long time do you think it take before i can handle it, it lurn it for one thing is not really what i want
[06:03:40] <shoky> well yeh.
[06:04:53] <beepbeep_> Whiskey, there's no shortcuts.
[06:05:13] <beepbeep_> Well there are, but they always bite you in the ass.
[06:05:27] <beepbeep_> Better to invest the time and do it good.
[06:05:28] <Whiskey> No its not :)
[06:05:38] <Whiskey> But sometimes it not worth to try lurn when you never use it
[06:05:52] <Whiskey> have enoth hard to lurn the HTML/CSS/PHP part
[06:05:52] <shoky> fine, don't learn it
[06:05:54] <shoky> but.. pay up
[06:05:59] <shoky> if you want me to work for you.
[06:06:55] <beepbeep_> Whiskey, I honnestly have never built something using HTML/CSS/PHP without also using javascript.
[06:07:49] <Whiskey> yeh i belive you :=)
[06:07:57] <katsh> Say i have a .hover() on an element that toggles a div. if i hover in and out multiple times real fast, the delayed hidw/show of the div will happen. how do i prevent this?
[06:08:17] <fabioportieri> any help is appreciated http://pastie.org/5621182
[06:10:41] <Whiskey> hmm im lost anyways as i donÂ´t know how to slove it anymore
[06:18:56] <Saaether> katsh you could put a delay on the hoverout event ex http://jsfiddle.net/XALFb/
[06:21:08] <katsh> Saaether: thanks. but isn't this a common problem though, with a name?
[06:21:18] <ziyadb> Hi guys!
[06:21:20] <katsh> bubbling, or chaining, or something of the sort
[06:21:23] <fabioportieri> any help pls http://pastie.org/5621182
[06:21:30] <amaroks> Hi ziyadb
[06:21:57] <ziyadb> What's the best way to insert a new article element in response to a button click event? Clone an existing element? unhide a pre-existing hidden element, or create a new one and attempt to display it properly?
[06:22:58] <ziyadb> e.g. #('button.CreateArticle').click(function() { $('body').append('article')}) or whatever.
[06:23:11] <ziyadb> s/#/$/
[06:29:21] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: what sort of data do you expect updateCoords to receive?
[06:30:16] <fabioportieri> ziyadb: i need the event so i can discriminate select versus change
[06:30:42] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: okay, one sec. Looking at jCrop docs
[06:31:27] <fabioportieri> thanks ziyadb
[06:32:48] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: why don't you use something like $('#img').on(select, updateCoords) ?
[06:33:43] <fabioportieri> mm select is an event internal to jcrop plugin
[06:34:41] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: updateCoords(coord, $(e)) ?
[06:35:40] <fabioportieri> you mean (coords, e), already tried, its' undefined
[06:36:20] <Shyghar> Hi, someone there?
[06:37:02] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: No, I mean $(e). Try it.
[06:37:06] <ziyadb> Shyghar: Hello.
[06:37:16] <fabioportieri> ziyadb: tried, it gives me compile error..
[06:38:11] <Shyghar> Can someone tell me where can i find the jqueryUI browser compatibility?
[06:38:28] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: do you know what variables jcrop makes available to its event handlers?
[06:38:34] <ziyadb> just find out whatever they are and use them.
[06:38:41] <ziyadb> e.g. http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop_Manual.html#Event_Handlers
[06:38:46] <ziyadb> Shyghar: Google it.
[06:40:19] <Shyghar> i mean the official jqueryUI in the site there is not this info
[06:40:20] <fabioportieri> afaik, only the coords
[06:42:34] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: and those are passed as only one argument (coords)?
[06:47:31] <Anticom> this doesn't work: $($('#fullFrame').toArray()[0].contentWindow).ready(function() { [...]
[06:47:44] <Anticom> how can i wait for a page in a frame to be ready from the outside?
[06:50:49] <fabioportieri> ziyadb: indeed, it's an object
[06:55:33] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: what's the e for then?
[06:56:46] <faraway> Anticom: is the url of the content of frame of the same domain ?
[06:56:56] <Anticom> solved it
[06:57:08] <Anticom> $('#myFrame').load([callback here]);
[06:57:18] <Anticom> but thank's anyway
[06:59:18] <fabioportieri> ziyadb: i hoped it would be the event, but unfortunately that function accepts only the coords
[06:59:44] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: how is that a problem? UpdateCoords is only called when onSelect is triggered.
[07:13:43] <ShawnRisk> how do I use the object parameters here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#AS3_Object_Embeds within this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/NmvA9/3944/ ?  I have tried to add object, and param and embed into the createPlayer function but the main video didn't show up. Any ideas?
[07:15:55] <fabioportieri> ziyadb: i need the event, or a way to wrap another function like onSelect: function() {  doStuffForSelectEventOnly(); updateCoords(); } but making so i loose all variable references inside updateCoords()
[07:16:54] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: onSelect:updateCoords does essentially that. Unless I'm missing something.
[07:17:11] <ziyadb> Ohh, right. You want to do something specific to onSelect.
[07:17:19] <fabioportieri> exactly
[07:17:39] <ziyadb> Then you could do onSelect: updateCoordsOnSelect(); function updateCoordsOnSelect() {....}
[07:17:40] <fabioportieri> without cloning the function, which is pretty ugly..
[07:17:45] <ziyadb> haha.
[07:17:48] <fabioportieri> eheh
[07:18:04] <ziyadb> Alternatively, you could just write the onselect specific code and callback updateCorods.
[07:18:34] <ziyadb> eg. updateCoordsOnSelect() { //on select specific code; updateCoords(); }
[07:19:03] <fabioportieri> problem is with this method i change scope somehow and all variables i use inside updateCoords get undefined :|
[07:19:30] <fabioportieri> but i guess that is the only way
[07:19:38] <ziyadb> If it works, just do it.
[07:19:44] <fabioportieri> since jcrop doesn't provide event inside the callbacks
[07:19:55] <ziyadb> Lame. Poor design choice.
[07:20:05] <lathan> fabioportieri, you could bind and trigger a custom event and send all the data as event data
[07:20:53] <lathan> updateCoords() has a .trigger('updateCoords',{var1: 'a', ....})
[07:20:56] <lathan> *could
[07:21:26] <lathan> and what you want to happen on select just sets a handler for that custom event
[07:23:21] <fabioportieri> this seems to work:  onSelect: function(coords) { doStuff(); updateCoords(coords);}
[07:23:37] <fabioportieri> my mistake to not pass the argument :|
[07:24:50] <ziyadb> fabioportieri: yeah, that's what I was suggesting.
[07:25:18] <lathan> fabioportieri, excuse me for jumping in without nowing what, but does the documentation use jQuery events? if so you could bind to the actual event....but don't do that if they don't publicize those events
[07:25:29] <ShawnRisk> how do I use the object parameters here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#AS3_Object_EmbedsÂ within this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/NmvA9/3944/Â ? Â I have tried to add object, and param and embed into the createPlayer function but the main video didn't show up. Any ideas?
[07:26:00] <fabioportieri> thanks very much for the support :)
[07:26:13] <ziyadb> shoky: hey! I've gone from a complete noob to useful in a day! :)
[07:27:36] <ShawnRisk> the problem with what I did was that the src was added to the object tag and not param and embed
[07:27:57] <lathan> Yes!
[07:35:32] <ShawnRisk> anyone can help me?
[07:37:04] <amaroks> ShawnRisk: probably I can if nothing much :P
[07:37:14] <ShawnRisk> :P
[07:37:27] <lathan> ShawnRisk, I'm looking at your jsfiddle....what isn't working right?
[07:37:28] <Lobosque> I can use foo.on('click', bar); to call the bar function when foo fires click. but what if I want to send additional arguments to bar? (along with the event argument)
[07:37:32] <lathan> I see the movie loading fine
[07:37:52] <ShawnRisk> lathan: I want to move from iframe to object which the code is in the other url I posted
[07:38:21] <lathan> do you have the attempt in a fiddle?
[07:38:44] <ShawnRisk> lathan: nope because all I didn't change much and it didn't load on my site.
[07:38:57] <lathan> because I'll gladly help debug an example, but I really don't want to just do the work for you
[07:39:11] <lathan> ShawnRisk, swap it over on the fiddle and I'll look at it
[07:39:34] <lathan> oh.....could cross domain security be interfering?
[07:39:42] <ShawnRisk> lathan: yes
[07:39:48] <lathan> hehe
[07:39:58] <ShawnRisk> lathan: that is why I want to switch from iframe to object
[07:40:13] <ShawnRisk> lathan: there is not much I changed and it wasn't right at all.
[07:40:16] <lathan> so the video files are on your domain?
[07:40:39] <lathan> and you don't want to have to iframe to youtube
[07:40:50] <lathan> ShawnRisk, do you have the ripped video file?
[07:40:57] <ShawnRisk> lathan: all the video are from youtube.
[07:41:14] <lathan> *thinking* can an embed pull across domains?
[07:41:38] <ShawnRisk> lathan: you see the code on the google developer site?
[07:43:39] <lathan> yah
[07:44:01] <lathan> ShawnRisk, show me what you are trying to do with the embed in the fiddle and I will tinker with it
[07:45:06] <ShawnRisk> lathan: all I did was was add the object code without src or value to ifr = $( and change var ifr = $('iframe', jqe); to var ifr = $('object', jqe);  that is all, but failed.
[07:45:27] <lathan> ?doesn't work
[07:45:42] <lathan> ShawnRisk, I need to see the failure to try and debug it
[07:46:10] <ShawnRisk> lathan: I mean doesn't work as in the big video doesn't display
[07:46:38] <ShawnRisk> lathan: you can run the code yourself in jsfiddle, just follow what I did.
[07:47:04] <lathan> ShawnRisk, the burden of busy work is on you when you are asking for free help from us
[07:47:11] <gryffus> hello, please could any1 be so kind to look at my code? I am having issues with video.js player and its events. The issue is described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14160220/trouble-getting-events-working-on-my-site
[07:47:17] <ShawnRisk> lathan: right give me a sec
[07:47:19] <lathan> thanks
[07:47:25] <gryffus> i would be very glad if anyone pointed me to the right direction
[07:50:38] <lathan> gryffus, the first thing I would do is to verify that the VideoJS library is loaded
[07:51:10] <gryffus> lathan: the player is there, so it must be... or not?
[07:52:05] <gryffus> look at the error message - it does not look like it cannot find VideoJS
[07:52:46] <lathan> gryffus, how do you trigger the error?
[07:52:56] <lathan> gryffus, which video player is the problem / where is it?
[07:53:16] <gryffus> i run the code in firebug
[07:53:16] <ShawnRisk> lathan: here is the new jsfiddle, which nothing is showing up now.  http://jsfiddle.net/NmvA9/3984/
[07:53:27] <lathan> gryffus, oh
[07:53:28] <lathan> ok
[07:53:35] <gryffus> there is only one video player on that page
[07:53:40] <gryffus> you can try it yourself
[07:55:26] <lathan> gryffus, are you sure you are using VideoJS.addEvent properly?
[07:55:41] <lathan> gryffus, it looks like it expects a DOM object as the first param
[07:56:14] <gryffus> lathan: i don't know. as you can see i am not very skilled at js
[07:56:15] <lathan> gryffus, however, that is what their docs say....
[07:56:47] <ShawnRisk> lathan: was that okay for me or gryffus?
[07:57:00] <lathan> ShawnRisk, it was gryffus but I'll get to yours in a few min
[07:57:11] <ShawnRisk> lathan: okay
[07:57:17] <lathan> gryffus, read the paragraph about Referencing the Player: https://github.com/zencoder/video-js/blob/master/docs/api.md
[07:57:29] <lathan> gryffus, you have to get a variable for the player, not just call VideoJS
[07:58:26] <lathan> ShawnRisk, you are missing a single quote at the end of your object creation line
[07:58:33] <ShawnRisk> lathan: let me loo
[07:58:34] <ShawnRisk> k
[07:58:47] <lathan> ifr = $('<object w....')
[07:58:52] <lathan> in function createPlayer
[07:59:20] <ShawnRisk> lathan: right, with that only the bottom videos show up not the big one.
[08:01:53] <lathan> ShawnRisk, in the fiddle, the error I see is a cross domain security problem
[08:02:12] <ShawnRisk> lathan: yes and I was getting that with iframe too
[08:02:37] <gryffus> lathan: ok, i have adjusted the code so it looks like this: http://pastebin.com/TCgsPWrY , now it does not throw any error, but the code in myFunc is not running... :(
[08:04:44] <ShawnRisk> lathan: anyway to fix this?
[08:05:31] <gryffus> lathan: oh wait after refresh it works... Thank you so much...
[08:05:49] <lathan> np gryffus
[08:05:52] <motox> I am working on a custom image carousel.  Is there a jquery option to make a div with overflow scroll at a given speed?
[08:05:53] <lathan> ShawnRisk, I don't know
[08:06:04] <motox> I just need a function name to look up
[08:06:15] <ShawnRisk> lathan: would it happen if I used iframe or object?
[08:06:27] <lathan> ShawnRisk, well, you are using an object...
[08:06:34] <lathan> ShawnRisk, and you didn't want to use the iFrame?
[08:07:20] <ShawnRisk> lathan: I was getting this error with the iframe: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL youtube
[08:07:36] <lathan> ShawnRisk, well, I get it with the embed as well
[08:07:46] <karolyi> does a radio button emit any event when i disable it from javascript?
[08:08:00] <ShawnRisk> lathan: right so there is no solution :(
[08:08:03] <lathan> ShawnRisk, here's my guess: youtube's swf file is trying to determine if it is on youtube and won't play
[08:08:05] <NoiseEee> karolyi: no
[08:08:14] <lathan> *won't play if its on another site
[08:08:33] <ShawnRisk> lathan: it can play in the iframe if you look at the other jsfiddle
[08:08:35] <karolyi> NoiseEee: so there's no way to know if it was disabled, without checking it periodically?
[08:09:01] <lathan> karolyi, if you disable it from javascript, you need to trigger an event saying it was disabled
[08:09:39] <NoiseEee> karolyi: correct
[08:09:57] <karolyi> lathan: i created a jquery ui widget which proxies the state of the radio button, but as it seems i can't proxy the disabling automatically
[08:10:18] <AieshaKirsten> what do we have here
[08:11:08] <lathan> karolyi, your widget just needs to be altered to trigger a disabled event when it disables a radio button
[08:11:25] <lathan> karolyi, $radio.attr('disabled','disabled').trigger('disabled')
[08:11:29] <ShawnRisk> hi NoiseEee
[08:11:40] <lathan> (or however you are disabling...the attr method is depricated for disabled)
[08:11:47] <karolyi> lathan: i see, i wanted to avoid triggering the disabled event
[08:12:04] <karolyi> lathan: deprecated? what is the new method to disable something?
[08:12:51] <lathan> karnowski, there is a new method for handling attributes like disabled and checked
[08:13:28] <lathan> ?prop @ karolyi
[08:13:48] <karolyi> lathan: i thought prop is the one which is deprecated
[08:14:04] <lathan> nope
[08:14:05] <lathan> prop is new
[08:14:31] <systemfault> attr and prop are not deprecated...
[08:15:40] <vali123> hey, if I have a greyscale alpha png image, is there a way to use it as a mask, to make it red/green/blue with the alpha transparency?
[08:15:46] <lathan> karnowski, prop was created in version 1.6 and it gets or sets all the true/false properties
[08:15:58] <lathan> systemfault, using attr for properties is deprecated
[08:17:01] <karolyi> lathan: ok, and is 'aria-checked' a property?
[08:17:23] <lathan> karolyi? that must be a custom attribute
[08:17:54] <karolyi> lathan: so element.attr('aria-checked', 'true') is valid and not deprecated?
[08:18:10] <motox> I am working on a custom image carousel.  Is there a jquery option to make a div with overflow scroll at a given speed?  I just need a function name to look up...
[08:18:25] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: I've been looking at your jsFiddle since you originally asked the question (just figuring out how it works) and then I read that you want to use object embed instead of iframe.
[08:18:40] <systemfault> karolyi: Do you understand the difference between an attribute and a property?
[08:19:05] <bahamas> hello. when using ajax, can I also pass error as an argument to ajax? the example I see chains error to the ajax call
[08:19:19] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: if you read the discussion here, we are getting the same errors with iFrame and Object so makes no different.  I want to get rid of the error.
[08:19:31] <bahamas> specifically, I'm talking about the $.ajax function
[08:19:39] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: Ah, didn't see that
[08:19:45] <systemfault> bahamas: Not sure I understand what you want to do to be honest.
[08:19:58] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: did you see the error?
[08:20:13] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: looking for it
[08:20:29] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: In the discussion... I'm not sure what the proble is
[08:20:54] <karolyi> systemfault: in the html terminology, elements only have attributes, so introducing the properties in jquerys terminology is a bit confusing
[08:21:00] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: I was getting this error with the iframe: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL youtube.  Others have said they got this with Object also.
[08:21:27] <lathan> BLeg, the problem is the youtube embed swf seems to be checking the top frame and its making it stop if its not on youtube, I think. It seems to be getting cross domain frame "unsafe" javascript errors
[08:21:27] <systemfault> karolyi: Right, .attr is to set/get any attribute you would set by writing them in the html
[08:21:57] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: I found your fiddle
[08:21:59] <lathan> karnowski, properties are things like: <input type="radio" checked />
[08:22:05] <systemfault> karolyi: A property is a member of the javascript DOM NODE object.
[08:22:08] <lathan> karnowski, or disabled
[08:22:16] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: Is it this one? http://jsfiddle.net/NmvA9/3984/
[08:22:25] <systemfault> karolyi: There's a overlap between attributes and properties but they're not the same
[08:23:18] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: yep
[08:23:50] <bahamas> systemfault: see here http://bpaste.net/show/BTZ6VERQFxllU5GJKUiH/
[08:23:50] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: And the problem persists if you change this object embed (which youtube no longer supports btw) into an iframe as well?
[08:24:32] <lathan> BLeg, I have a feeling that the youtube swf does a call to top.location.href and that giving problems with jsfiddle's iframe structure, but...idk...I hate swf's
[08:24:34] <systemfault> karolyi: Example, for <input type="checkbox" checked="checked"> myCheckbox.attr('checked') will return 'checked' while myCheckbox.prop('checked') would return either true or false because it's querying the DOM Node
[08:24:43] <ArxPoetica> lo peeps
[08:24:48] <ArxPoetica> Haven't been in here for a while.
[08:25:11] <BLeg> lathan: There is no cross-domain problem here as the original fiddle works flawlessly
[08:25:13] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: it does, it is AS2 it doesn't support but AS3 it does from what I read
[08:25:19] <karolyi> systemfault: but aren't the two interconnected?
[08:25:26] <ArxPoetica> $('body').removeClass(â¦..remove them all somehow???â¦) OR $('body').removeAttr('class') ?????
[08:25:26] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: on my live site there is
[08:25:30] <lathan> BLeg, 'cause the iframe ....hm...yah
[08:25:34] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: I get that error
[08:26:04] <systemfault> bahamas: IIRC, you can but you should always use the promise interface as it's far more generic/flexible
[08:26:20] <systemfault> bahamas: .done/.fail/.always
[08:26:26] <lathan> systemfault, if he's using the latest and greatest version of jQuery
[08:26:33] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: We have a client whose business is based almost entirely on youtube (we pull their videos from YT) and they recently told us that they received an email from youtube telling them that they wre no longer supporting embed
[08:26:37] <bahamas> systemfault: can I use success like that?
[08:26:46] <NoiseEee> BLeg: yoink!
[08:26:54] <bahamas> I'd rather specify all callbacks in the same manner
[08:26:59] <systemfault> bahamas: .success/.error/.complete are deprecated for the more generic names
[08:26:59] <ArxPoetica> BLeg, WHAT?!
[08:27:04] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: okay but more to the point how do I get rid of the error?
[08:27:14] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: I can't see the error
[08:27:26] <bahamas> systemfault: ah, you mean .done instead of .success and .fail instead of .error?
[08:27:34] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: using Chrome?
[08:27:34] <lathan> BLeg, it shows up in the firebug / chrome console
[08:27:47] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: and the YT pulling support for embed coincides with their share link as well...
[08:27:47] <ArxPoetica> so .removeClass(somehow all) or .removeAttr('class') ??
[08:28:01] <BLeg> lathan: I'm not seeing it in my console
[08:28:02] <ArxPoetica> That's devastating...
[08:28:05] <ArxPoetica> Can't be true.
[08:28:19] <systemfault> Aragon: never use .removeAttr with 'class'
[08:28:22] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: do you want to see if you can see this on my live site?
[08:28:27] <karolyi> systemfault: and if that's the case, the .is(':disabled') won't always work if i don't set the 'disabled' attribute too
[08:28:28] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: Yes please
[08:28:37] <bahamas> systemfault: indeed, it is. thank you
[08:28:42] <systemfault> Aragon: unless, of course, you want to remove ALL classes
[08:28:48] <systemfault> Err
[08:28:50] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: pmed you
[08:28:56] <systemfault> ArxPoetica, not Aragon
[08:30:20] <ArxPoetica> yeah. want to remove all classes
[08:30:24] <ArxPoetica> call it calamatous.
[08:30:31] <systemfault> ArxPoetica: It should be good then
[08:30:52] <ArxPoetica> Front end application that controls state and class should reflect
[08:30:54] <ArxPoetica> thanks
[08:31:01] <lathan> karnowski, :disabled will work because it checks the prop: return elem.disabled === true;
[08:31:35] <ArxPoetica> class will never be the same
[08:31:42] <ArxPoetica> (on body only)
[08:31:44] <karolyi> lathan: are you sure? i just tested it
[08:32:11] <lathan> karolyi, so you did .attr('disabled','disabled') and .is(':disabled') didn't update?
[08:32:35] <karolyi> lathan: no, i did it with prop()
[08:34:33] <systemfault> karolyi: With prop, you use the DOM interface so you would do: .prop('disabled', true);
[08:34:55] <systemfault> With .attr, you would do .attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[08:35:31] <ShawnRisk> lathan: BLeg is using firebug which doesn't show the error right?
[08:36:06] <lathan> ShawnRisk, I don't know, it should...
[08:36:16] <ShawnRisk> lathan: doesn't for me
[08:36:40] <BLeg> lathan, ShawnRisk: I use Firefox to develop because chrome just isn't there yet... I did try it in chrome and I do see the error
[08:36:49] <systemfault> lol...
[08:36:57] <systemfault> Chrome is just years ahead..
[08:37:11] <anew> chrome yes
[08:37:19] <anew> netscape navigator no
[08:37:25] <lathan> karolyi, here is a complete example of prpo and attr, and both is(':disabled') and .attr disabled work for both
[08:37:30] <karolyi> systemfault: right, i got it working. is there a radio button element planned in jquery ui? actually i got a working radio button widget here
[08:37:41] <BLeg> systemfault: If you like things to crash and have really weird problems that don't happen in other browsers except maybe IE7, Chrome is great... without going into this discussion because I dont have time
[08:37:46] <lathan> karolyi, http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/WeBh7/
[08:37:56] <systemfault> karolyi: I don't like jQueryUI so I'm not the good guy to ask for that :)
[08:38:01] <lathan> BLeg, chrome never crashes for me
[08:38:21] <lathan> BLeg, I like everything about chrome except its console...I like firebug better, but I'm getting used to their console
[08:38:28] <lathan> it runs faster, less memory, ....
[08:38:46] <systemfault> I thought that firefox used less memory...
[08:38:54] <karolyi> (chrome/chromium is far superior to FF now, i can tell)
[08:38:54] <lathan> now I'm using the version from the Ubuntu linux repository which is often behind on versions...so I get a more stable version
[08:38:58] <systemfault> Because of its bad one process model
[08:39:09] <BLeg> lathan: I'll give you: firefox is a memory pig for this ^ reason
[08:39:34] <lathan> systemfault, I don't think firefox could run as well as my chrome does with 5 windows each with 7-12 tabs in them for weeks
[08:40:09] <lathan> BLeg, to be honest, I got annoyed at FF blowing up its version number, and doing soo many rapidfire updates
[08:40:19] <systemfault> lathan: I don't see that as being a common case...
[08:40:21] <netraameht> How to put ontent of load() in val() ?
[08:40:26] <systemfault> Nobody cares about edge cases.
[08:40:27] <netraameht> content*
[08:40:29] <lathan> and for a while last year it was broke more than it worked...kept crashing for me
[08:40:36] <lathan> systemfault, well...I'm an edge case :P
[08:40:51] <lathan> in just about all my computing areas
[08:40:51] <BLeg> lathan: Yeah I can understasnd that... but I give a lot of leniency to that because of firebug...
[08:40:56] <netraameht> ?
[08:41:18] <lathan> BLeg, I hate that chrome doesn't let the ctrl key work when editing attributes and html
[08:41:59] <netraameht> How to put content of load() in <input type='text' />?
[08:42:09] <netraameht> value=""
[08:42:10] <karolyi> BLeg: FF got now it's own developer plugin, i guess firebug will be outdated soon
[08:42:12] <netraameht> val()
[08:42:44] <BLeg> karolyi: That's bombin.... I'm ready for that... I'd switch to chrome in a heartbeat if it had even half the debug capability of firebug
[08:43:02] <brettster> anyone here able to help with query masonry
[08:43:03] <systemfault> BLeg: It has it all.. and way more.
[08:43:03] <brettster> ?
[08:43:06] <karolyi> BLeg: what are you missing from chromium?
[08:43:17] <karolyi> BLeg: -> systemfault
[08:43:36] <BLeg> systemfault: Where?
[08:43:59] <netraameht> Is anyone able to answer my question?
[08:44:44] <netraameht> hello?
[08:44:55] <BLeg> netraameht: It's easier to just ask
[08:45:01] <ShawnRisk> hello? -> netraameht
[08:45:08] <kke05597> *** Quits: kswedberg (kswedberg@gateway/shell/jquery.com/x-tnpegxjffbxueasj) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[08:45:08] <netraameht> I did twice BLeg
[08:45:32] <netraameht> How to put content of load() in <input type='text' />?
[08:45:34] <ShawnRisk> netraameht: I have asked questions before 4 or 5 times before an answer came up
[08:45:47] <BLeg> netraameht: Perfect example then.. If someone can answer, they will
[08:46:28] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: The most fun ones are the ones you ask for days xD
[08:46:39] <netraameht> So if nobody answers nobody is able do this?
[08:47:05] <BLeg> netraameht: Easiest thing to do is ask once an hr or half hr and google fu at the same time
[08:47:21] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: yes, and I am stupid like that but I try to make them work on my own now before I ask here.
[08:48:30] <BLeg> ShawnRisk: Oh yeah me too, I don't mean you're stupid for asking for days, I mean something like (in your case an mine) a Drupal developer asking something... You NEVER get answers to Drupal questions, and google is dumber than a broken doorknob when it comes to drupal
[08:48:38] <tomasm-> hi, can anyone recommend a color picker (preferably a color wheel) that operates on a text field (filling in the hex code) JUST like how datepicker works? ie where you click on the input or an icon (ie a 24px box of the color), and it opens the picker
[08:49:05] <ShawnRisk> BLeg: right
[08:49:06] <Miles8of9> guys i'm looking for a jquery widget that does autocompleting + ajax + multiple selection and deselection list... is there anything like?
[08:49:24] <creativx> Miles8of9: use select2 ?
[08:49:35] <creativx> http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[08:49:38] <creativx> it is.. awesome
[08:49:46] <BLeg> netraameht: I actually don't understand your question to be honest
[08:50:13] <tomasm-> theres some sort of color picker on jqueryui's theme roller. any ideas what that is?
[08:50:15] <Miles8of9> creativx: i've read docs but it looks like it can't do all 3 things simultaneously
[08:50:26] <systemfault> BLeg: Why use a tool without support anywhere then?
[08:50:32] <systemfault> (Drupal)
[08:50:56] <creativx> Miles8of9: have opnly tested it with an ajax bound datasource
[08:51:01] <creativx> and select + deselect
[08:51:18] <creativx> so it autocompletes on that datasource after its loaded
[08:51:31] <yogurt_truck> Drupal has no support? that's insane
[08:51:41] <karolyi> lathan: if you remove the disabled prop with removeProp('disabled'), and then do a prop('disabled', true), .is(':disabled') returns false, is that normal?
[08:52:08] <ShawnRisk> Drupal has support but not enough, and this is a jquery channel not drupal so we focus o that.
[08:52:15] <yogurt_truck> the community and support is what keeps that mess of a cms/framework from disappearing from the planet
[08:52:48] <BLeg> systemfault: It's not my choice. I work in a studio where Drupal is the development "suite"
[08:53:17] <wizonesolutions> I'm getting a long-running script error sometimes on a page where I process the same thing around 650 times...I've read that a good technique can be to clone the stuff in question and do the work offscreen, then swap it back in. Or do the work in batches. Would people agree?
[08:53:30] <BLeg> systemfault: I've suggested not using it but I'm a junior developer technically so the chances are slim
[08:53:32] <Miles8of9> creativx: autocomplete works properly but i don't see an example where it does multiple select + ajax autocomplete...
[08:53:50] <yogurt_truck> BLeg: I've been a Drupal developer since 2008 and lack of support has _never_ been an issue. Unless you're using some obscure, unmaintained, contrib module
[08:54:26] <wizonesolutions> yogurt_truck: D8 will help keep it from disappearing since it's somewhat joining the larger PHP community now.
[08:54:26] <wizonesolutions> but, I digress.
[08:54:32] * wizonesolutions is a Drupal developer also
[08:54:50] <faraway> wizonesolutions: if you can split your work in smaller chunks you can use Timeouts
[08:54:51] <yogurt_truck> BLeg: so you're probably not good at googling, or at communicating your issues on the #drupal channel, or your company put you on some project that isn't suited to Drupal and so your issues must be too bizarre that no one wants to help you. xD
[08:54:54] <BLeg> yogurt_truck: Hold, I'll find you n example
[08:54:59] <ShawnRisk> wizonesolutions: what do you mean by that?
[08:55:08] <creativx> Miles8of9: uhm.. maybe we think of different things. multiselect is kind of pain, we needed it to keep the dropdown visible after click/enter on an item
[08:55:16] <systemfault> BLeg: Ahhh ok :)
[08:55:24] <yogurt_truck> ShawnRisk: Drupal and Symfony will join forces for D8
[08:55:34] <creativx> Miles8of9: and there was a bug (resolved in 3.3) that gave the hovered item wrong index offset after clicking / selecting the item
[08:55:47] <ShawnRisk> yogurt_truck: meaning?
[08:56:18] <faraway> wizonesolutions: e.g. if you have a loop form 1 to 650 you can replace you loop with a setTimeout construct and a complete callback
[08:56:20] <wizonesolutions> faraway: I think it can be yeah. It's the same thing for however many "records" there are on the page. Timeouts would be the second approach I mentioned?
[08:56:31] <BLeg> yogurt_truck: Drupal's off topic, but google taxonomy_get_tree and go to the D7 doc. Tell me the possible values of the return array
[08:56:32] <yogurt_truck> wizonesolutions: Hopefully. The architectural "improvements" for D7 are a complete mess IMO. There's a lot of things that IMO should be totally ditched and replaced by symfony's modules
[08:56:46] <karolyi> okay, my bad
[08:57:26] <netraameht> How to put content of load() in <input type='text' />?
[08:57:29] <faraway> wizonesolutions: then you page will be responsive and you won't get the long running script warning
[08:57:36] <Miles8of9> creativx: i'm looking for something that does exactly this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iCr6t04-bk
[08:58:00] <netraameht> How to put content of load() in <input type='text' />?
[08:58:03] <yogurt_truck> ShawnRisk: meaning Drupal is going to adopt some of the Symfony components in the next versions
[08:58:17] <wizonesolutions> faraway: should I do it in chunks, or should *every* run of the callback be in a setTimeout? I want it to feel like it happened instantly, or at least within around 5 seconds. They will be scrolling down sequentially so it's OK if it takes a little bit to work.
[08:58:28] <BLeg> netraameht: You just asked that like 12 seconds ago... I'd help but I dont understand the question
[08:58:39] <ShawnRisk> yogurt_truck: nice
[08:59:01] <creativx> Miles8of9: fork select2 ;)
[08:59:11] <wizonesolutions> ShawnRisk: you asked what I meant by something, what were you referring to? sorry, I said a couple things
[08:59:41] <ShawnRisk> wizonesolutions: about this: D8 will help keep it from disappearing since it's somewhat joining the larger PHP community now.
[08:59:53] <netraameht> BLeg, I have a file with data in it, I want to load that file with load() and put it in a <input type='text' /> textflied
[08:59:59] <netraameht> textfield*
[09:00:18] <tomasm-> anyone have recommendations for a color wheel picker widget other than farbtastic? or is that the best? i'm seeing its a bit old, though i dont want anything html5 based
[09:00:37] <faraway> wizonesolutions: multiple timeouts wont run in parallel, so normally it wont make sense to create multiple timeouts at once
[09:00:54] <BLeg> netraameht: First google result: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/585234/how-to-read-and-write-into-file-using-javascript
[09:01:13] <wizonesolutions> faraway: so batch processing basically...like 100 or 200 runs at a time?
[09:01:17] <wizonesolutions> and then at the end, set another setTimeout
[09:01:26] <wizonesolutions> ShawnRisk: oh, see yogurt_truck's reply. that's what I meant :)
[09:01:30] <faraway> wizonesolutions: really depends on your situation. yeah something like that
[09:02:01] <faraway> wizonesolutions: if you do much DOM manipulation like appends removes with jquery, you should look if you can optimize that too
[09:02:07] <wizonesolutions> faraway: OK good to get some confirmation in any case. thanks!
[09:02:45] <ShawnRisk> wizonesolutions: right
[09:02:47] <morphine> gentlemen and ladies, please post links to your favorite form validation libraries/plugins
[09:02:58] <wizonesolutions> yeah I've kind of forgotten exactly what it does too, lol. I'll come back and get more specific if I still have problems.
[09:03:29] <faraway> wizonesolutions: ^^ that would help to find a solution ;)
[09:03:39] <netraameht> BLeg those answers dont work D:
[09:05:38] <netraameht> BLeg I currently have http://pastebin.com/FsYgghNq
[09:06:07] <chrisbolton> Anyone use formtastic in rails with select2? I built a collection select where you could select multiple options but I'd like the ability to add additional options in line so I added select2 in hopes of getting this accomplished but haven't been able to get it to respond.
[09:06:52] <BLeg> netraameht: Well, the first answer says this: For completeness, the OP does not state he is looking to do this in a browser (if he is, as has been stated, it is generally not possible)
[09:08:24] <BLeg> netraameht: So essentially, you can't. There's a library in one of the answers that looks like it will do it
[09:10:03] <sampaka> i have a ajax event trigged when i change option of select menu - manually no problem - but changed via jquery the event is not triggerd even adding .trigger('change') - any idea?
[09:13:18] <netraameht> BLeg, okay, then Ill just put time there, any hows?
[09:13:35] <BLeg> netraameht: Put time where?
[09:14:41] <netraameht> In the textfield
[09:16:48] <morphine> gentlemen and ladies, please post links to your favorite form validation libraries/plugins, especially those that are simpler to use
[09:17:38] <brettster> question
[09:17:48] <brettster> I'm loading content in with ajax
[09:17:51] <brettster> which is working
[09:18:26] <brettster> but I'm also trying to use jquery masonry on what's being loaded in - not working
[09:18:39] <brettster> if i load the div on the page directly - it works
[09:18:47] <brettster> but it won't work on what's being loaded in with ajax
[09:18:49] <brettster> what can I do?
[09:21:04] <ShawnRisk> I have to go talk to everyone later
[09:21:32] <brettster> anyone?
[09:23:34] <dan2k3k4> in the jquery slider, can step accept function?
[09:24:08] <dan2k3k4> the api just says Number
[09:24:27] <shoky> that doesn't sound like function
[09:24:45] <sunbeam> I'd like to add, <div class="corners-top"></div> at the begin of a <li> and <div class="corners-bottom"></div> at the end (of </li>)
[09:24:46] <dan2k3k4> what I'm looking at doing is having the step change depending on the value/range
[09:24:49] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[09:25:23] <dan2k3k4> though I suppose it'd be too confusing for people if they see the slider suddenly jump up further then it normally does...
[09:26:00] <shoky> sunbeam: append/appendTo, prepend/prependTo
[09:27:44] <shoky> dan2k3k4: you can always change the step option at runtime
[09:30:23] <sunbeam> shoky: prepend if for start of li
[09:30:27] <sunbeam> append if for end of li?
[09:31:08] <shoky> sunbeam: do you really need to ask?
[09:32:32] <sampaka>  i have a ajax event trigged when i change option of select menu - manually no problem - but changed via jquery the event is not triggerd even adding .trigger('change') - any idea?
[09:33:01] <shoky> sampaka: what do you mean "the event is not triggered" ?
[09:33:35] <dan2k3k4> shoky: ah, ok thanks, though thinking about it, it's probably not good for the UX but I'll try it on Monday
[09:33:59] <dan2k3k4> shoky: I suppose I can do that in the slide() event
[09:34:18] <sampaka> shoky: the option is changed but when i do it manually my ajax is triggerd - now the value is changed and nothing else
[09:34:35] <shoky> dan2k3k4: yah.. http://jsfiddle.net/C5Wgu/5/
[09:35:32] <shoky> sampaka:  what does ajax have to do with a 'change' event of a <select> ?
[09:36:33] <quijote> can I ask a silly javascript question?
[09:36:54] <shoky> sampaka:  anyway, .trigger('change')  or just .change()  should run your 'change' event handler (assuming you set it with jquery)
[09:36:55] <quijote> when does one use var adnn when does one not use var. I keep reading conflicting information
[09:37:28] <sampaka> shoky: maybe i dont understand it right - but when i change manually the option my cms triggers ajax - but done via jquery this does not happen. thanks for your answer anyway!
[09:37:29] <shoky> quijote:  you use var when you're defining a new variable, you dont use var when you're referring to an already defined variable
[09:37:58] <quijote> well I get that but I asee somone useing a variable without ever defining it
[09:38:12] <quijote> variablenmae= array();
[09:38:23] <quijote> and never var variablename
[09:38:37] <shoky> quijote:  you can do that, it's bad practice and will lead to errors if you're not experienced
[09:38:47] <quijote> ah thanks
[09:38:47] <shoky> quijote: so stick to what i said and you'll do fine
[09:39:30] <quijote> thanks shoky, I am trying to fix somonese code and they arent around to tell me what the hell they did.
[09:39:36] <sampaka> shoky: i tried $('#edit-field-paper-credit-layout-und>option:eq('+selectnumber+')').attr('selected', true).change(); and .trigger('change'); but its seems not to work. i will do some more reading ;)
[09:41:02] <shoky> sampaka:  first of all, you need to trigger the change on the <select> , not on the <option>
[09:41:50] <shoky> sampaka: well, maybe doing that will take care of it for you. otherwise.. consult your cms docs i donno :P
[09:42:26] <sampaka> thanks shoky!! i really apreciate your input!
[09:42:39] <shoky> ;]
[09:43:20] <quijote> shoky,  oen more question. what not var window.variable = array(); -- I get an error
[09:44:09] <shoky> quijote:  what?
[09:44:53] <quijote> sho
[09:45:27] <quijote> shoky, I cannot define a variable like this
[09:45:39] <quijote> I get an error
[09:45:51] <shoky> quijote: uhh, didn't we go through how you should define variables?
[09:46:02] <shoky> quijote: also, what's array()
[09:46:25] <shoky> quijote: also saying you get an error without saying what error is not really productive
[09:46:42] <quijote> unexpected token .
[09:46:46] <quijote> works fien without the var
[09:46:49] <quijote> hence the question
[09:46:50] <shoky> oh
[09:46:57] <shoky> didn't notice the var
[09:47:04] <shoky> yeah you can't do that
[09:47:09] <shoky> var variable = ...;
[09:47:15] <shoky> not var window.variable = ...;
[09:47:22] <tw2113> don't you declare arrays like var myarray = []; ?
[09:47:22] <quijote> but window.varaiable = .. works
[09:47:33] <shoky> quijote: that's not a variable, that's a field in an object
[09:47:36] <shoky> the window object
[09:47:40] <tw2113> or maybe new array;
[09:47:46] <tw2113> or am i mixing in php too much?
[09:47:46] <shoky> to set a field's value, you do objName.fieldName = value;
[09:47:54] <shoky> quijote ^^
[09:48:18] <Krambiorix> hi, in one iframe i want to call a function in another iframe (this works already) that opens a dialog in the first iframe... Is this possible?
[09:48:46] <shoky> tw2113: yes except it's Array not array
[09:49:02] <tw2113> doh
[09:49:02] <shoky> and yeah, [] is much nicer
[09:49:15] <bahamas> literals are generally nicer. less typing
[09:49:33] <quijote> Ok, so rry for being thik. Still new to js and jquery. Let me stop beating around the bush. I want to make a avriable that is accessiable to all functions in my script. I thought having the variable above the function declarations would do this but no go
[09:49:47] <Cronoh> it would, make it global
[09:50:09] <quijote> Thats what I thought
[09:50:23] <Cronoh> var myGlobal; function func(){ myGlobal = 1; }
[09:50:25] <Cronoh> valid
[09:50:33] <shoky> yup
[09:51:14] <quijote> then something else is worng with thsi code. Hold as I beat my head against the wall. Thanks to shoky and the reset
[09:51:52] <shoky> quijote:  you CAN do window.myGlobal = ...;  and that would work fine too. but it's not recommended
[09:51:55] <bahamas> quijote: if you define that variable inside a function and don't return it, it's not really global
[09:52:16] <shoky> returning it hardly makes it global ;P
[09:52:46] <Cronoh> if you define it in a function it isnt global, returned or not ;p
[09:52:49] <shoky> especially as you're returning its value, not .. it
[09:53:48] <bahamas> shoky: what do you mean? yes, I realize I should have also specified that you need to assign the return value to a name
[09:54:10] <shoky> bahamas:  i mean what Cronoh said, exactly
[09:54:48] <shoky> it's a local variable, nothing more to say about it
[09:54:59] <shoky> you don't return variables, you return values
[09:55:33] <quijote> bahamas, sorry stepped away. I udnerstand this concept. I am not new to PHP so maybe tahst fing me up.
[09:55:57] <Cronoh> knwoing php beforehand is not helpful ;p
[09:56:00] <bahamas> shoky: what's the difference between variables and values?
[09:56:04] <quijote> shoky, why is window.variable not recommended
[09:56:10] <shoky> bahamas:   var x = 1;    x is a variable,  1 is a value
[09:56:19] <quijote> variable is teh handle that conatins a value
[09:56:23] <bahamas> shoky: right
[09:56:26] <quijote> agreed
[09:57:14] <bahamas> ok, I know what you mean now.
[09:57:24] <shoky> quijote:  because it "pollutes the global namespace", i.e. it can conflict with other shit thats there.. it's not recommended unless you know what you're doing and have a real reason for a real global
[09:57:49] <quijote> I see
[09:58:02] <quijote> so hwo does oen create areal global without polluting name space?
[09:58:05] <Cronoh> two javascript sciprts that use window.company_name
[09:58:08] <Cronoh> would conflict and ruin them
[09:58:12] <shoky> quijote: it's fine to have maybe one or just a few globals, objects that serve as namespaces just for your app's stuff
[09:58:30] <Cronoh> only use a global if you need it, and you should be fine
[09:58:53] <shoky> unless you dont know whether you need it or not ;P
[09:58:54] <quijote> all I have for now is window.DEBUG
[09:59:17] <quijote> I am actually dealing with an array that I cannot seem to read after it gets created even though it was defined outside of the function
[09:59:23] <shoky> quijote: you probably have no reason whatsoever to do window.anything
[09:59:35] <quijote> shoky, jaja thanks
[09:59:42] <quijote> ok I wont do that
[09:59:47] <quijote> good to know best practice
[10:00:03] <shoky> <Cronoh> var myGlobal; function func(){ myGlobal = 1; }
[10:00:05] <shoky> just do that.
[10:00:10] <Cronoh> quijote show us a pastey of the js and im sure we can tell u the problem with your global
[10:00:22] <quijote> k
[10:00:55] <quijote> http://www.niztech.com/Client/fje/cambria/test.html
[10:01:09] <Cronoh> thats not a pastey.jpg
[10:01:16] <quijote> when it works the string yousee is transfored into a button
[10:02:00] <Cronoh> umm...
[10:02:36] <Cronoh> u must be kidding if u think ima read through http://www.niztech.com/Client/fje/cambria/resources/ewinery/ewinery-naz2.js to find where you might be having the problem
[10:02:39] <Cronoh> how about a little guidance ?
[10:03:10] <quijote> look at line 64 its commented out
[10:03:20] <quijote> I am tryingto breakup teh funtiosn so that thye cna stand on their own
[10:03:20] <Cronoh> put this in a pastey
[10:03:25] <Cronoh> aint no line number in my view source
[10:03:48] <quijote> I am trying to get the startEwinery button to kisck it all off
[10:04:15] <quijote> commenetd  / /  renderPageButtons();
[10:05:46] <Cronoh> ill take a look when u put what u need in a pastey and give real info as to your problems
[10:05:52] <quijote> dont worry guys. I am going to focus on it. I've figured out worse problems
[10:06:00] <Cronoh> lol ok..
[10:06:09] <quijote> not sure what pasty is but tyanks cronah
[10:06:34] <shoky> quijote: i dont think you put anything in a $(document).ready block..
[10:07:03] <shoky> not that it has to do with any globals
[10:07:57] <Cronoh> quijote: Its standard to put the code you need help with in a pastebin website such as: http://jsfiddle.net/, so we don't have to search through your your whole code and guess whats wrong or not working
[10:08:12] <jrajav> jsbin.com if you're a cool kid
[10:08:25] <quijote> jaja thanks guys
[10:08:29] <Cronoh> o rly is that where all the cool kids r now
[10:08:40] <jrajav> The cool kids were always there :P
[10:08:42] <quijote> I'll have to play with that some time
[10:08:48] <jrajav> jsfiddle.net came later and fixed a lot of stuff
[10:08:54] <jrajav> Then jsbin.com got a lot better again
[10:08:58] <quijote> you are are cool kids in my book :P
[10:10:44] <imsky> i'm cool too
[10:11:20] <quijote> oh all right. yoru cool too  -- in the voice of eddy izzard
[10:11:36] <imsky> in the voice of morgan freeman: "imsky has always been cool"
[10:22:05] <chrisbolton> Moving from using chosen to select2 is there anything like allow_single_deselect: true ?
[10:25:11] <Tixz> How can one change global css values? I have 32640 elements and changing their styles individually will be very slow
[10:25:45] <amaroks> Tixz: search and replace?
[10:25:57] <nickelnick|2> i use notepad++ for find/replace in files
[10:26:27] <Tixz> amaroks: nickelnick|2: It has to be via javascript (so I can animate/change on the fly)
[10:27:06] <amaroks> Tixz: do they have same css class?
[10:27:13] <Tixz> Yup
[10:27:37] <amaroks> $('.classname').each(function() { $(this).css('property', 'value'); });
[10:28:09] <Tixz> amaroks: That's exactly what I don't want. Imagine having to hit the DOM well over ~30,000
[10:28:15] <Tixz> times
[10:29:32] <amaroks> Tixz: the loop is probably a must here?
[10:30:25] <nickelnick> what all are you changing? every single css ?
[10:30:30] <garann> Tixz: can you add a class to a parent element and just change that?
[10:30:38] <Tixz> Well I was hoping there was a way to change the global css and let the rendering engine handle the update. Maybe someone had tried this, but I can just play with regex's myself to do this
[10:30:40] <amaroks> or maybe put inline css like <div id="style"><style>.classname{property: value;}</style></div>
[10:30:56] <amaroks> then $('#style').html("new styles");
[10:31:18] <jlembeck> Tixz: I'd do what garann just suggested
[10:31:52] <jlembeck> even add a class to body, and then in the css have .new-class .classname { property: value }
[10:31:54] <nickelnick> yea wrap in single, then all you have to do is add .somenewclass to the beginning of any selector you wanna change
[10:31:57] <Tixz> Here's what I'm doing: I have a 16 graphs (SPLOM) that have around 2000 datapoints each. Since a lot of datapoints are on top of each other I apply opacity to make it clearer where you have a high occurrence of datapoints
[10:32:25] <jlembeck> you only have to hit the DOM once, then the rendering engine will take over. Quick and easy
[10:32:43] * nickelnick agrees
[10:33:12] <Tixz> Alright that was my first idea too, will look into it :) Thanks guys
[10:46:25] <motox> how can I specify index X in a list?  $('li').index(3) does not play nice...
[10:48:31] <catcher> I want to toggle between two css properties onClick.  Any shortcuts, or is adding/removing an extra class still the best route?
[10:50:47] <rmill> ?.toggleClass @ catcher
[10:51:02] <rmill> Oh, bot-t, you've failed us
[10:51:03] <Absolute0> How can I pass all mouse events to the parent element and none to the child element?
[10:51:08] <rmill> `.toggleClass @ catcher
[10:51:15] <rmill> `api .toggleClass @ catcher
[10:51:19] <b-ot> catcher, no matches.
[10:51:20] <shoky> .toggleClass

[10:52:08] <catcher> thanks rmill
[10:58:13] <Absolute0> Is there a way to bind an element to ALL mouse events?
[10:59:34] <voidr> Absolute0: you don't bind elements to events, you do the opposite
[11:00:25] <Absolute0> Yes, how do I do the opposite?
[11:00:51] <Absolute0> Some sort of namespace would be nice.
[11:01:23] <voidr> Absolute0: what do you want to accomplish exactly?
[11:02:21] <Absolute0> voidr: I am simulating a css cursor by placing an img tag at the postition of the mouse. The img tag interrupts some of the mouse events. I want to send everything to the parent container.
[11:02:59] <ziyadb> Hi guys.
[11:03:12] <ziyadb> I'm having a _very simple_ issue with an event handler.
[11:03:19] <Absolute0> is there an unhover event?
[11:03:22] <ziyadb> I believe the function is being called before the event is triggered.
[11:03:23] <ziyadb> https://gist.github.com/dd20123ed6c4fe5b1231
[11:03:44] <ziyadb> ? unhover
[11:03:49] <ziyadb> ?unhover
[11:03:53] <Absolute0> nvm
[11:03:54] <Absolute0> :)
[11:03:58] <Absolute0> http://api.jquery.com/hover/ does both
[11:04:07] <ziyadb> obviously.
[11:04:24] <Absolute0> obviously!
[11:04:48] <Absolute0> just because something is "obvious" to you doesn't mean it is to everyone else.
[11:05:14] <ziyadb> Absolute0: no, think about it.
[11:05:30] <ziyadb> if you hover, then you unhover, then the hover event is undone.
[11:05:46] <ziyadb> re: event handler question, just wrapped it in an anon function.
[11:05:46] <Absolute0> does click() handle unclick too?
[11:05:47] <Absolute0> no!
[11:05:54] <ziyadb> Absolute0: yes, but hover is a different case.
[11:05:54] <Absolute0> there's mouseup however
[11:06:10] <Absolute0> it's just slightly different from the other events.
[11:06:45] <ziyadb> Yep.
[11:07:22] <Johnyyy> Hiho bros, im having this short code : http://pastebin.com/msm2GLcx ... Im getting informations from database and showing ID in div, that div is showing on mouse over, problem is my parsed data have same id btn-slide, so i need new id for every row
[11:08:27] <johnkpaul> you mean same id, "panel", right?
[11:08:27] <Absolute0> there's also mouseleave, pft...
[11:08:35] <johnkpaul> ^@ Johnyyy
[11:08:50] <johnkpaul> Johnyyy: if you change $("#panel") to $(this).next(), it should work
[11:10:26] <Johnyyy> will try man
[11:11:53] <x0Jakeyboy0x> Can anyone help me get jquery's .get function to work outside of my own domain using IE. Every other browser works but IE.
[11:13:54] <mg983> what ver IE
[11:15:45] <Johnyyy> johnkpaul now it works, but when i do mouseleave, it still closes just 1st one.
[11:15:56] <johnkpaul> Johnyyy: you have to change both of them
[11:16:15] <x0Jakeyboy0x> 8 or 9 mg983
[11:16:18] <Johnyyy> i did =o
[11:16:38] <x0Jakeyboy0x> well that was helpful...
[11:17:11] <motox> if i do:    $('myElem').css('background-image'),   it returns  url('blah.jpg')      Is there a way (short or parsing the string) to get just the URL out of that?
[11:21:56] <Johnyyy> fixed. thanks man.
[11:22:32] <NoiseEee> motox: no
[11:23:53] <motox> NoiseEee> ok, thanks.  I'll just add replace().replace() on the end then to strip it down
[11:24:14] <motox> I didnt know if there was some pseduo-element type way of grabbing the URL value
[11:32:24] <x0Jakeyboy0x> Can anyone help me get jquery's .get function to work outside of my own domain using IE? Every other browser works but IE.
[11:37:03] <iiicubed> hello all...
[11:37:14] <iiicubed> hoping to get some help on a jquery mobile problem
[11:37:27] <iiicubed> in short: when navigating between pages in multi-page template...
[11:38:07] <iiicubed> i need a .classed element to trigger a popup when that element is contained in the now active page
[11:38:33] <iiicubed> while i can get it to display, it immediately closes the popup...
[11:40:22] <iiicubed> js snippet here: http://jsfiddle.net/293Wa/
[11:50:05] <Krambiorix> hi, in one iframe i want to call a function in another iframe (this works already) that opens a dialog in the first iframe... Is this possible?
[11:50:28] <relipse> inside of $(function() { what is this?
[11:50:52] <x0Jakeyboy0x> seems theres all questions and no help here
[11:51:06] <x0Jakeyboy0x> today anyway
[11:52:27] <relipse> whats the prob x0Jakeyboy0x
[11:52:32] <wagtag> Is the DataTables plug-in still the best or is there a better more recent plug-in that does similar sorting and display?
[11:52:52] <x0Jakeyboy0x> Need to get jquery's .get function to work outside of my own domain using IE. Every other browser works but IE.
[11:53:17] <relipse> why would it? javascript has a security help
[11:53:48] <x0Jakeyboy0x> i need to pull a response from a websites api
[11:53:52] <relipse> javascript has a secruity that cannot be breached, the only workaround is to write server code to grab the url , in php this is like file_get_contents('url');
[11:54:12] <relipse> yeah the only way that would work is if you are including it in a <script> tag
[11:54:30] <x0Jakeyboy0x> how come it works on FF, safari?
[11:54:37] <relipse> heck if i know, it shouldn't
[11:54:43] <relipse> does it work on chrome too?
[11:56:26] <relipse> but nonetheless ajax requests should be limited to your server only
[11:56:26] <x0Jakeyboy0x> yup
[11:56:33] <relipse> can i see it?
[11:56:41] <x0Jakeyboy0x> sure give me a moment
[11:57:34] <relipse> google for cross-domain ajax problem
[11:57:39] <relipse> you'll see what I am talking about
[11:57:46] <relipse> all browsers should block it
[11:58:57] <x0Jakeyboy0x> can i message you?
[11:59:21] <relipse> quickly i got to get back to work
[12:00:27] <relipse> ...

[12:00:32] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript

[12:01:27] <x0Jakeyboy0x> why does that work then?
[12:01:31] <x0Jakeyboy0x> on anything but IE
[12:04:41] <relipse> ok i am stumped, why would x0Jakeyboy0x's cross-domain-ajax request WORK on 3 web browsers?
[12:04:49] <relipse> shouldn't it fail on ALL WEB BROWSERS
[12:15:40] <GoSox> I have a loop that runs over and over. The first time the loop runs, it's going to .show() something that is invisible. Should I just do .show() every loop through, ignoring the fact that the item is already visible. Or should I check the visibility, and only .show() it if it's invisible, every single time I run through my loop?
[12:15:52] <GoSox> i know both techniques will work, but which is the better way to do things
[12:16:22] <MistuhKurtz> GoSox, set a boolean var in your loop
[12:17:40] <MistuhKurtz> GoSox, i'm writing an example
[12:19:29] <awc737> I have marker.set('group', groupId);
[12:19:45] <awc737> now I need to get $.each where group = x
[12:20:02] <awc737> $(markers.get('group')=0).each(function(m, marker) {
[12:20:03] <awc737> or something...
[12:21:21] <chrisbolton> Does anyone know how to deselect using select2?
[12:22:29] <MistuhKurtz> GoSox, http://jsfiddle.net/ms8Xg/1/
[12:23:46] <hugo_moss> say you have 10 click buttons with 10 distinct id's, and these 10 clickable buttons are associated with 10 distinct event handlers using the .on jquery function.  if all 10 click buttons are grouped under one div, can i turn off the whole div of event handlers off with the div id passed to the jquery selector, instead of turning off each individual handler?
[12:24:33] <HeN> GoSox: just use .show() , I've created a test case for you http://jsperf.com/show-all-or-check-if-visible-first
[12:25:38] <GoSox> HeN: you should add MistuhKurtz's technique to that test
[12:27:04] <HeN> GoSox: it doesnt matter, you'll use .show() any way. adding more variables will be unnecessary
[12:27:34] <GoSox> well no i wouldn't use show if the counter variable was true, which it always would be except the very first time
[12:27:50] <MistuhKurtz> I did keep some optimization in mind when writing mine
[12:27:51] <HeN> you only show the item on the first loop?
[12:28:17] <MistuhKurtz> well I showed the first item in the loop
[12:28:20] <GoSox> yeah thats the idea, show it during the first loop, and leave it visible forever, while the loop keeps looping every 1.5 seconds
[12:28:26] <MistuhKurtz> i may have misinterpreted the requirements
[12:29:04] <MistuhKurtz> or, how about
[12:29:08] <HeN> GoSox: can you describe more of what this loop is doing? if its only needed once, why using a loop?
[12:29:17] <MistuhKurtz> $(elements).show().each(function(){ /* ... */ });
[12:29:31] <MistuhKurtz> I think that's the most elegant if it will suffice
[12:29:36] <GoSox> the loop is doing a whole slew of other things, but until it returns it's first result, the container for those results should be invisible
[12:30:26] <MistuhKurtz> so it's looping over an array or object, not DOM elements?
[12:30:54] <GoSox> its looping meaning it's a function that is run every 1.5 seconds
[12:31:03] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[12:31:27] <MistuhKurtz> then I think my original solution should work pretty nicely then.
[12:31:32] <GoSox> yes it totally works
[12:31:39] <GoSox> all three solutions works
[12:31:53] <GoSox> i just wonder which is best
[12:31:59] <GoSox> right now i'm just doing .show() every loop
[12:32:02] <GoSox> without checking anything
[12:32:05] <GoSox> cause its easy
[12:32:06] <MistuhKurtz> if you setup a benchmark with mine vs the other one you would certainly see an improvement
[12:32:52] <MistuhKurtz> especially since it's a continuous loop
[12:33:08] <HeN> MistuhKurtz: you miss the point of adding a variable to global scope
[12:33:15] <MistuhKurtz> oh yeah
[12:33:19] <MistuhKurtz> that's one thing not quite so nice...

[13:30:58] <melter> is it possible to prevent content inside jquery ui tabs from getting the jquery ui theme applied to it (specifically, links)?
[13:31:50] <BillCriswell> aj910martin: If you do console.log($(this)) in the mousedown you'll see what this is.
[13:32:35] <iman> there is not any beautiful message notification in jquery without use plugin, because plugin makes page heavy
[13:32:36] <iman> ?
[13:32:44] <scr3am> aj910martin: it's (underscore) _id !!!
[13:33:25] <BillCriswell> scr3am: that's just the count of it. It doesn't have the group_N
[13:35:05] <scr3am> ok, then follow melter's advice... then you'll see what you need
[13:35:43] <aj910martin> BillCriswell: I did that. It's a Kinetic.Group object, and that's what I need
[13:36:14] <aj910martin> BillCriswell: Or am I missing something. Pardon me. I am new in this area
[13:36:34] <NoiseEee> iman: nope.

[13:43:43] <iman> NoiseEee: gritter is very cool, i use it too, i hope is that rest to customize it's color
[13:44:04] <mahoski> aj910martin: in the mousedown handler, change $(this).attr('id') to this.attrs.id
[13:44:09] <NoiseEee> well then you might like the first on that list there iman
[13:44:13] <BillCriswell> aj910martin: Ah, what scr3am said. Didn't know to look there.
[13:44:59] <aj910martin> scr3am: Thanks! What's wrong with $(this).attr('id')? i thought this the Jquery way
[13:45:17] <scr3am> it's not a DOM element
[13:45:41] <iman> you mean  Achtung NodeX
[13:45:46] <iman> NodeX: sorry
[13:45:51] <iman> you mean  Achtung NoiseEee
[13:46:46] <Absolute0> can I construct a document.on() call with the selector including a context?
[13:47:19] <Absolute0> $(document).on('click', '.triggers .maximize_trigger:visible', function (e) {..}); <<-- I need to add context after :visible
[13:48:16] <Absolute0> probably replacing document with the context element would do the trick :)
[13:48:46] <Absolute0> yup
[13:49:29] <jtsternberg> quick question... is there a shorthand way to do this?
[13:49:30] <jtsternberg> $('.manual-login.pop').click(function() { hide_scanner(); });
[13:49:44] <jtsternberg> or is that as shorthand as it gets?
[13:49:48] <Absolute0> $('.manual-login.pop').click(hide_scanner);
[13:50:01] <Absolute0> functions are objects in js...
[13:50:13] <iman> NoiseEee: thank you dude, it was very useful for me, i waste time for find some of them
[13:50:13] <Absolute0> so you can simply pass them without the parenteces
[13:50:58] <jtsternberg> Absolute0: eureka! I was wrapping the function name in quotes
[13:51:06] <iman> NoiseEee: I am looking for a jquery template to forms all the web, like table, form, background and ... like gnome theme but for web, do you know that?
[13:51:23] <sealeaf2> Hi, is anyone familiar with jquery.fileupload?
[13:51:44] <ziyadb> Hey guys.
[13:51:54] <ziyadb> I'm appending a new article element to a section.
[13:52:01] <ziyadb> How do I get the existing elements to slide down?
[13:52:23] <ziyadb> newPost = $($('article')[0]).clone().prependTo('#article-listing') <-creation code.
[13:53:50] <sethetter> ziyadb: By slide down do you mean move down so the newly prepended article is above them and not overlapping?
[13:54:10] <Eviltwin> Don't do $($('article')[0])
[13:54:19] <Eviltwin> Do $('article').first() or $('article').eq(0)
[13:54:36] <ziyadb> sethetter: currently, it is above them and doesn't overlap. So functionality-wise, I think it's good. _However_. What I'm trying to do is make existing article elements slide down smoothly..
[13:54:49] <ziyadb> Eviltwin: oh, okay.
[13:55:07] <GoSox> i have a list where i append an item to the beginning of the list, then i remove the last list item. when i do this, my CSS li:last-child selector no longer styles the (new) last item in my list
[13:55:37] <ziyadb> GoSox: that is because CSS styling is only applied once.
[13:55:45] <GoSox> hmm
[13:55:51] <ziyadb> Either reload the styling after modifications, or manually restyle the new last item.
[13:56:11] <GoSox> how do you reload the styling?
[13:56:21] <ziyadb> e.g. $("li:last").style(whatever)
[13:56:26] <Absolute0> quit
[13:56:32] <ziyadb> Just include that in your function and you should be done.
[13:57:16] <GoSox> ziyadb: isn't that how to do your second suggestion, not your first?
[13:57:28] <ziyadb> Yes. Which is simpler..
[13:57:40] <GoSox> what is option 1?
[13:58:49] <ziyadb> Well, you'd probably have to write some code to reapply the stylesheet..
[13:58:52] <iman> NoiseEee: how can i fixed it top-left?
[13:59:06] <ziyadb> GoSox: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2024486/is-there-an-easy-way-to-reload-css-without-reloading-the-page
[13:59:43] <GoSox> yeah ill take door #2
[14:00:01] <GoSox> in some browsers, it is working properly, but in most itis not
[14:00:04] <ziyadb> Heh.
[14:00:49] <NoiseEee> iman: buncha tips in http://boedesign.com/blog/2009/07/11/growl-for-jquery-gritter/ if you're still talking gritter; either way, whatever options available to your notification stuff will be in the documentation for it
[14:01:23] <ziyadb> Slide down smoothly guys! How?!
[14:01:53] <scr3am> wrapper.slideDown(800);
[14:02:08] <scr3am> or slideDown('slow');
[14:04:36] <ziyadb> scr3am: Yeah, not that simple..
[14:04:39] <guytonal> Hey guys..is this the place to get help for jQuery?
[14:04:51] <ziyadb> Context, newPost = $('article').first().clone($(this).fadeIn(2000)).prependTo('#article-listing');    $('#article-listing').find("article:last").slideDown("fast");
[14:04:55] <EyePulp> guytonal: Nope - try #mootools
[14:05:02] <EyePulp> =P
[14:05:04] <ziyadb> It isn't working like it should.
[14:05:11] <guytonal> :D
[14:05:15] <ziyadb> guytonal: indeed. Share your burdens!
[14:05:24] <ziyadb> What troubles you, weary traveler?

[14:22:27] <ziyadb> guytonal: Line 3003 of cometchatjs.php
[14:22:33] <ziyadb> if (_5) {
[14:22:33] <ziyadb>         this.setAttribute("version", new deconcept.PlayerVersion(_5.toString().split(".")));
[14:22:33] <ziyadb>     }
[14:22:49] <ziyadb> After that point, the node is removed.
[14:23:34] <guytonal> ziyadb: ok..dose this interfere with the player initialization?
[14:24:21] <ziyadb> guytonal: the "this" value being referenced is. deconcept.SWFObjectCC
[14:25:30] <ziyadb> guytonal: and the entire thing is being called by "jqcc.cometchat();" which is presumably the method for initializing the player. Yeah?
[14:26:16] <guytonal> uhhhh no..you are referring to the chat system..everything related to the player is called sound managerâ¦the method that calls the swf object is:
[14:26:30] <guytonal> <script type="text/javascript">
[14:26:30] <guytonal> 	
[14:26:32] <guytonal> 	//some soundmanager settings
[14:26:33] <guytonal> 	soundManager.url = 'wp-content/themes/medium/swf/';

[14:26:38] <guytonal> 	soundManager.debugMode = false;
[14:26:39] <guytonal> 	       	
[14:26:39] <guytonal>     </script>
[14:26:43] <tw2113> ?paste
[14:26:43] <guytonal> lolâ¦.how can i send a code here?
[14:26:43] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:26:50] <ziyadb> tw2113++
[14:26:52] <Eviltwin> No paste dumps here
[14:26:54] <guytonal> oh
[14:26:56] <guytonal> ok
[14:27:06] <Eviltwin> Don't send more than one or two lines of code at a time
[14:27:50] <guytonal> http://jsfiddle.net/qZtwy/
[14:27:58] <ziyadb> guytonal: well, evidently there is some interference. As that is the part which causes the play button to disappear.
[14:28:28] <guytonal> i seeâ¦i may be mistaking â¦but maybe its the way i registered the scripts?
[14:28:39] <ziyadb> registered?
[14:28:50] <guytonal> "added" them to the page
[14:28:54] <jrockjiggz> cometchat
[14:29:01] <jrockjiggz> oops lol
[14:29:17] <guytonal> when i added the js files i added them in the header..but i don't know if there is a proper order to add them
[14:29:42] <ziyadb> it doesn't really matter.
[14:29:50] <ziyadb> not usually anyway.
[14:29:54] <jrockjiggz> also, if you want to dynamically generate swf objects, see swfObject
[14:30:03] <guytonal> i mean this: http://jsfiddle.net/qZtwy/1/
[14:30:07] <ziyadb> anyway, debug it and see what you figure out.
[14:30:49] <ziyadb> guytonal: looks okay.
[14:30:54] <guytonal> hmm
[14:31:12] <ziyadb> I have a simple question.. newPost = $('article').first().clone().prependTo('#article-listing').$('#article-listing').find("article:last").slideDown("fast");
[14:31:20] <guytonal> ok..ill try to figure that out
[14:31:23] <ziyadb> The existing article (before the prepended one) is not sliding down :(
[14:31:29] <ziyadb> guytonal: use the Chrome Debugging tools.
[14:31:34] <ziyadb> s/Chrome/Tool of Choice?
[14:31:41] <guytonal> i am but not seeing any error
[14:31:41] <guytonal> s
[14:31:49] <guytonal> yes, chrome
[14:32:23] <ziyadb> Ehh.
[14:32:51] <ziyadb> guytonal: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints
[14:34:16] <guytonal> thank you ziyadb..ill try and take it from here
[14:34:19] <guytonal> 8)
[14:34:23] <ziyadb> Good luck!
[14:34:28] <guytonal> thx
[14:35:09] <sampaka> i just read that setting the value of the select via jquery doesn't trigger the change() event of the select element. does anybody have an idea how to do so. even adding .change() wont do the trick
[14:36:13] <BillCriswell> sampaka: .trigger('change')
[14:36:57] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: heeeeeeeeeelp!
[14:37:08] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: Oh, good day first :)
[14:37:25] <ziyadb> newPost = $('article').first().clone().prependTo('#article-listing'); $('#article-listing').find("article:last").slideDown("fast"); <- Not sliding down :(
[14:37:44] <sampaka> billcriswell: even .trigger('change') does not the job
[14:39:00] <BillCriswell> $('select').val('2013').trigger('change') will trigger a change event.
[14:39:34] <sampaka> let me check
[14:39:42] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: prependTo('#article-listing') should probably be prependTo($('#article-list'))
[14:40:16] <awc737> is that a sopparusrex?
[14:40:30] <awc737> sopparusaurusrex
[14:40:33] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: all right, I'll change my id naming conventions :D
[14:40:45] <ziyadb> But that doesn't address the issue :(
[14:43:04] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: You'd have to add it to the dom hidden then slideDown('fast')
[14:44:40] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: so add the new element but keep it hidden, then slide down the existing elements and fadein the new element?
[14:45:49] <BillCriswell> slide down the existing elements?
[14:46:37] <ziyadb> I don't even know anymore.
[14:46:59] <xboi209> guys
[14:47:02] <xboi209> i think i found a bug
[14:47:03] <xboi209> :o
[14:47:05] <BillCriswell> I imaged you just wanted to slide in one new element at the bottom.
[14:47:24] <xboi209> pls someone look
[14:47:25] <xboi209> http://jsfiddle.net/fHX3k/
[14:47:38] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: no, at the start. Hence, prepend.
[14:47:42] <xboi209> take off the $.noConflict(); line and replace jQuery with $ and it won't work anymore
[14:47:45] <xboi209> i mean
[14:47:46] <xboi209> it will work
[14:49:00] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: So you just want to add an copt of an element to the top?
[14:49:06] <xboi209> oh no
[14:49:08] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: precisely!
[14:49:09] <xboi209> i found the problem
[14:49:14] <xboi209> sorry if anyone read my question
[14:49:17] <xboi209> D:
[14:49:33] <ziyadb> Ideally It'll fade in and have the next element slide down.
[14:49:42] <xboi209> no wait, it doesnt work
[14:49:51] <BillCriswell> Be careful with the . you may need to escape it.
[14:49:54] <sampaka> BillCrisWell: my select box still does not react to the change trigger - i just found this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8996260 - what do u think about the "added solution"
[14:51:50] <Danielss89> CAn someone tell me why this http://dev.eye4web.dk/cinal/index.php <-- won't react in IE when clicking on the images themselves?
[14:51:55] <Danielss89> it should give an alert..
[14:52:03] <Danielss89> works in FF/chrome/safari
[14:52:54] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: http://jsbin.com/izesoy/1/edit may help.
[14:54:05] <BillCriswell> sampaka: It would stink if you ever didn't want to trigger the change event when you adjusted the value of it.
[14:55:13] <sampaka> i see so little solutions left
[14:55:53] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: YUP!
[14:55:55] <ziyadb> Thank you!
[14:56:20] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: No problem.
[14:56:40] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: hmm, just to learn. Difference was that I was applying the slideDown to the existing list item. Whereas you applied it to the new item. Correct?
[14:57:04] <BillCriswell> Yes. Think so.
[14:57:11] <ziyadb> Magnifique.
[14:58:09] <TelFiRE> I am using the jQuery easing plugin. It does not work. How do I make it work? I already worked through why it was giving me errors, and it is functioning and getting called. But it is not being used. It is still clearly the old jswing easing.
[14:58:56] <Pilotbob> Is there a way to appendTo the body of the parent page when the code is running in the context of an iframe?
[15:00:17] <b-ot> u don't work
[15:00:22] <rmill> Pilotbob, same domain?
[15:01:00] <BillCriswell> sampaka: http://jsbin.com/ibanis/1/edit this should explaint he "trigger" thing a little more.
[15:01:04] <Pilotbob> rmill: yes
[15:01:10] <TelFiRE> I am doing everything according to easings.net -- jquery easing is loaded. I'm trying to use easeOutBounce. It is not bouncing. it is using swing still. It is ignoring my specifications: homeRegions.find('.views-row-1').animate({ 'left':'0%' },300,'easeOutBounce');
[15:03:56] <rmill> Pilotbob: $( '<div>romg wat</div>' ).appendTo('#wee', window.parent.document);
[15:03:58] <rmill> or
[15:04:00] <rmill> something.
[15:04:16] <quijote> use
[15:04:45] <quijote> to all  the cool kids -- trying to use jsfiddle.net  how do I get a unique URL so I can share it
[15:05:14] <TelFiRE> jquery.easing.js has not been updated in over 5 years. Is it simply not up to date any more and no longer works? What do people use to ease their animations if so?
[15:05:18] <shoky> quijote: save
[15:05:23] <Danielss89> http://dev.eye4web.dk/cinal/index.php <--- in IE it seems like my #wrapper div is blocking its childs click event.. can i somehow prevent this?
[15:05:27] * rmill snickers
[15:05:47] <BillCriswell> quijote: There's a "Share" button at the top.
[15:06:00] <quijote> I am blind as f*k
[15:06:03] <quijote> i am not seeing it
[15:06:11] <BillCriswell> It's on the very end.
[15:06:18] <Pilotbob> rmill: Trying this .appendTo("body", window.parent.document) it is still attaching to the body elemnt within the iframe.
[15:06:20] <quijote> oh save
[15:06:33] <quijote> oh save then share
[15:06:41] <quijote> fail -- I am just so frustrated cant think
[15:06:50] <BillCriswell> Happens haa.
[15:07:01] <quijote> I am a newbie can you tell.
[15:07:09] <shoky> Danielss89:  what makes you say that its #wrapper that's blocking it? and blocking it how?
[15:07:27] <quijote> anyone one want to help me not wreck havoc?
[15:07:27] <Danielss89> shoky: actually i found out its not..
[15:07:30] <quijote> http://jsfiddle.net/zJvWT/
[15:07:47] <Danielss89> shoky: Something is blocking the click event in IE :S and i have no idea what..
[15:08:08] <Danielss89> maybe i've starred myself blind.. i've been trying to fix this for hours now
[15:08:26] <BillCriswell> Danielss89: Go take a dump. That helps me.
[15:08:36] <quijote> jajaj true
[15:08:46] <Danielss89> BillCriswell: a dump of...
[15:08:48] <Danielss89> ?
[15:08:48] <Danielss89> :D
[15:08:56] <quijote> BillCriswell, good advbice
[15:09:01] <sampaka> i just test my jquery in IE (was working fine in FF, Chrome, Safari) - $('#edit-field-paper-credit-layout-und').val('+selectnumber+').trigger('change'); in IE the drop down menu has no value selected at all (its blank)
[15:09:26] <quijote> ok, anyone want to help a newbie figure out why he fails all over an array
[15:09:28] <quijote> http://jsfiddle.net/zJvWT/
[15:09:40] <Krambiorix> anyone please??? in one iframe i want to call a function in another iframe (this works already) that opens a dialog in the first iframe... Is this possible?
[15:09:41] <BillCriswell> sampaka: Are you trying to select the value "+selectnumber+"?
[15:09:55] <BillCriswell> Or do you just want .val( selectnumber )
[15:10:01] <sampaka> its part of a longer script that works well
[15:10:29] <shoky> quijote: you're still making the same mistake..... AJAX IS ASYNCHRONOUS
[15:10:38] <shoky> quijote: sec.
[15:10:39] <GoSox> i've got a bit of code like this, where the slideUp always work, but sometimes the remove() doesn't always work. So it leaves hidden elements on my page. Is there something about the way remove() works that could be causing this?
[15:10:59] <GoSox> $("#v23").slideUp(400, function() { $("#v23").remove(); });
[15:11:01] <quijote> shoky not sure how that helps. i get data I can work with it
[15:12:03] <quijote> shoky, Oh i get it you are saying the function continues even though the data hasbn't all gotten there. I just want to return teh JSOn file to a state I can do something with it
[15:12:24] <shoky> quijote: startEwinery()  returns IMMEDIATELY
[15:12:31] <shoky> quijote: before the ajax request is even sent
[15:12:38] <quijote> ahh ok
[15:13:01] <quijote> so how do I check for the data?
[15:13:04] <rmill> Pilotbob: $( window.parent.document.body ).append( 'wee' );

[15:27:07] <JoeSlack> are they both added at the same time, or is blank option there before
[15:27:38] <JoeSlack> IE gets silly with quote escapes sometimes
[15:27:59] <ziyadb> shoky: I don't think that's it though. Code looks fine to me.
[15:28:10] <sampaka> so is there a way to get IE back to be reasonable?
[15:28:34] <JoeSlack> dunno?  Let me test it?  fiddle?
[15:31:49] <shoky> ziyadb: that doesnt make much sense
[15:31:57] <ziyadb> shoky: the code?
[15:32:01] <shoky> ziyadb:   if ($("#newPost")){
[15:32:15] <shoky> ziyadb:  $(...) will always return a truthy value, you wanna check the .length
[15:32:29] <ziyadb> shoky: oh, _always_? That must be it then.
[15:32:42] <relipse> whoever uses sublime text 2, what is the best sftp plugin?
[15:32:54] <ziyadb> Always even if there isn't an element with newPost id?
[15:32:56] <shoky> ziyadb: it _always_ returns a jquery object, which is not false or null or 0
[15:32:58] <shoky> so its truthy.
[15:33:12] <shoky> ziyadb: even if it doesnt find the element, it still returns a jquery object
[15:33:13] <ziyadb> Hmm, so how would I go about evaluating this then?
[15:33:23] <shoky> ziyadb: check the .length
[15:33:33] <shoky> ziyadb: a jquery object i like an array
[15:33:36] <shoky> is
[15:33:52] <ziyadb> So if it doesn't exist, I should expect the length to be 0, correct?
[15:33:58] <shoky> yes
[15:34:07] <shoky> btw
[15:34:18] <shoky> doing:  $('#bla').whatever(...)
[15:34:24] <shoky> well,
[15:34:31] <shoky> doing:   $("#newPost").attr('contenteditable', 'false')
[15:34:49] <shoky> you dont need to check if it exists first. running jquery methods on an empty jquery object just doesnt do anything
[15:35:06] <shoky> so you can safely just do it without the if
[15:35:40] <ziyadb> Ah, got it.
[15:35:50] <shoky> ziyadb: ahh
[15:36:09] <shoky> er
[15:36:33] <shoky> nothing
[15:36:33] <shoky>  ;]
[15:36:46] <sampaka> JoeSlack: i read to add .css('display', 'inline') for IE and that did the work
[15:36:47] <sunbeam> does anyone know how I can best get the recommend button for facebook?
[15:36:49] <sunbeam> on my page
[15:36:50] <ziyadb> heh, thanks once more!
[15:40:43] <ziyadb> shoky: hmm, so a quick general question.
[15:41:14] <ziyadb> shoky: I have a dblclick event defined for article elements. However, it doesn't apply to the newly cloned article elements. Any idea why that could be?
[15:42:09] <shoky> ziyadb:  first of all, clone() doesn't copy event handlers unless you pass true as argument
[15:42:47] <ziyadb> shoky: yup, did that. And it worked!
[15:42:48] <shoky> ziyadb: 2nd, usually its better to use event delegation for such things. delegating the event handling to an element further up the DOM that contains the elements you're clicking on
[15:42:50] <ziyadb> Awesome!
[15:42:54] <shoky> heh cool
[15:43:55] <ziyadb> shoky: hmm, about delegation. So I'd write  the event handler on the ul and apply it to the clicked list items?
[15:44:48] <ziyadb> cause what I currently have is just what you advised against. event handler set up for siblings. Should I have it at the parent instead?
[15:44:57] <shoky> ziyadb: you'd  call  $('#myList').on('dblclick', '.clickableArticle', function() { ... })
[15:45:11] <shoky> ziyadb: read about event delegation in http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:45:35] <shoky> and of course.. change #myList and .clickableArticle to suit your stuff
[15:46:23] <shoky> ziyadb: yeah at the parent, or some close ancestor that is already in the DOM when you're setting up the event handler
[15:47:09] <ziyadb> shoky: why is that better?
[15:47:45] <shoky> ziyadb:  several reasons.. first of all its only one event handler being set up on the list, instead of 100 event handlers if you have 100 articles..
[15:48:21] <shoky> ziyadb: 2nd, it makes it so you dont have to worry about setting up event handlers on the elements that are dynamically added (or cloned)
[15:48:32] <ziyadb> smart.
[15:48:39] <shoky> you just set up the handler on the ancestor once, and the events will bubble up to it
[15:52:58] <ziyadb> shoky: $('#article-list').on('dblclick', $('article'), function() {..}) applied the function to all article elements, including those that weren't clicked...
[15:53:46] <shoky> not $('article')
[15:53:50] <shoky> just 'article'
[15:53:52] <shoky> it's a selector
[15:54:04] <sunbeam> Is there a way to change the height of the count of likes box of facebook?
[15:54:25] <ziyadb> shoky: right, worked.
[15:54:47] <ziyadb> But I don't understand the distinction.
[15:54:52] <ziyadb> One is a selector and the other is?
[15:54:58] <shoky> $('article')  is a jquery object
[15:55:03] <shoky> well no,
[15:55:06] <shoky> it's a function call
[15:55:09] <shoky> that returns a jquery object
[15:55:13] <shoky> hardly the same thing as a string
[15:55:15] <shoky> 'article'
[15:55:37] <ziyadb> True, alright.
[15:56:06] <sufian> Hey guys
[15:57:37] <sufian> is there a way I can get the value of a id? for example if ".test" outputs the number 11 is there a way I can get hold of the number value from the class text though to use as a number in jquery?
[15:58:05] <sufian> class test**
[15:58:17] <JoeSlack> well, you could always parse it with regular expression, right?
[15:58:31] <JoeSlack> and evaluate each character, string or int
[15:59:05] <MagmaRules> Hi there, anyone knows of a plugin that would allow me to display json structures as trees to easily navigate them ?
[15:59:20] <sufian> any links to the docs? I am new to  jquery just learning :)
[15:59:53] <shoky> MagmaRules: no, but there's this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fPRXJ/   (c) EvilTwin
[16:00:14] <batmanbond3d> hey, anyone how to take a snapshot of a div and convert it into an image?
[16:00:50] <shoky> batmanbond3d: afaik its not a simple task.. involves canvas and SVG
[16:01:03] <shoky> but maybe there's a nice plugin that makes it easy, donno
[16:02:24] <sufian> batmanbond3d: http://experiments.hertzen.com/jsfeedback/
[16:03:19] <sufian> JoeSlack: Do you know of any examples or links to the docs which could help me with my issue?
[16:04:05] <shoky> sufian: i didnt understand what you meant.  what does this mean:   ".test" outputs the number 11
[16:05:19] <MagmaRules> shoky:  yeah that will do =)
[16:06:17] <JoeSlack> I think he means this shoky:   <div class="test">11</div>
[16:06:28] <shoky> JoeSlack: i'd rather not make assumptions ;]
[16:06:28] <JoeSlack> $(".test").html()
[16:06:44] <shoky> he did say "value of a id"
[16:06:51] <JoeSlack> haha ya
[16:06:54] <shoky> so i'm really not clear as to wtf he wants ;p
[16:06:58] <JoeSlack> i made an assumption thinking he meant value of a class ;)
[16:07:08] <shoky> "value of a class" makes just as little sense
[16:07:09] <JoeSlack> not understanding ids vs classes
[16:07:23] <JoeSlack> it makes sense, since   html() is a type of value
[16:07:33] <sufian> JoeSlack: Flash is outputting a value to the class .test. Lets just say that value is 11. I want to use that value in a jquery string how would I grab the value which is output by the class .test
[16:07:34] <shoky> of the element, not of the class
[16:07:39] <JoeSlack> sure
[16:07:52] <JoeSlack> sufian
[16:07:56] <JoeSlack> $(".test").html()
[16:08:07] <shoky> .text() is usually nicer
[16:08:07] <b-ot> shoky, memorised âtext()â.
[16:08:11] <JoeSlack> ya, text()
[16:08:53] <JoeSlack> sufian: Here is the documentation on selectors:  http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[16:09:10] <sufian> Thanks guys.
[16:09:47] <JoeSlack> Wait - when did http://api.jquery.com change it's design!?!?
[16:10:00] <tw2113> today
[16:10:02] <shoky> wowza
[16:10:10] <JoeSlack> craaaazy....
[16:10:16] <GoSox> ziyadb: were you the one helping me with that :last-child issue i was having earlier?
[16:10:32] <sufian> Today
[16:11:12] <tw2113> powered by WordPress
[16:11:26] <JoeSlack> Awww..... no comments on the new api docs?
[16:11:35] <JoeSlack> i found comments to be the most informative part
[16:12:19] <shoky> really? most i've read were too outdated to be of any use
[16:12:55] <JoeSlack> some were outdated, but a LOT of them helped me with gotchas, and other undocumented problems.  Most of those problems do indeed get patched, but It's helped me hundreds of times, at least
[16:13:30] <shoky> welp. time to embrace change
[16:14:00] <JoeSlack> For sure, I'm not bitching, we can add to this.
[16:14:33] <JoeSlack> I'd like to have an actual embedded chat on each page.  Real time discussion with others reading the same topic
[16:14:57] <JoeSlack> just a small socket io client
[16:15:27] <shoky> dont really see the use in that
[16:16:11] <JoeSlack> You've never used an api doc with chat before..?
[16:16:13] <shoky> hi , you need help with the same thing i need help with? whats up? can you help me with this? no? oh ok
[16:16:23] <shoky> guess not
[16:16:36] <GoSox> so I have a problem, and my problem is that .remove() seems to randomly not work
[16:16:42] <JoeSlack> pretty common in engineering, internal teams at least
[16:17:03] <JoeSlack> at HP all doc pages have instant chat feature
[16:17:05] <GoSox> i can see it is being given the proper ID, but that ID isn't removed from the page
[16:17:22] <shoky> sure, internal chat..
[16:17:29] <shoky> you're talking to people in HP, not just.. the public
[16:17:42] <JoeSlack> sure, but jquery open source :)
[16:17:58] <shoky> right, totally different
[16:18:07] <JoeSlack> sure, but i'd use it the same way
[16:18:15] <JoeSlack> either way, doesn't matter. just a thought
[16:18:16] <shoky> and say what?
[16:18:36] <JoeSlack> hey, i'm having trouble with .promise  i can chat with others reading the same doc
[16:18:49] <shoky> who says they can help..
[16:19:00] <shoky> the most qualified people wont be there
[16:19:02] <JoeSlack> might not be able to, but maybe they can work together
[16:19:04] <shoky> cuz.. they have no reason to
[16:19:17] <JoeSlack> but everyone uses the docs, experts AND amateurs
[16:19:38] <JoeSlack> nice people, the same people like that like to help others in real life on projects
[16:19:39] <shoky> why not just come here ;p
[16:19:52] <JoeSlack> less people use IRC than use websites :)
[16:20:03] <shoky> that's a good thing :)
[16:20:08] <JoeSlack> haha, ya.
[16:20:29] <tw2113> http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/04/24/irc-is-dead-long-live-irc/
[16:21:37] <tw2113> our friend freenode here, has seein a user growth rate of 468% since 2003
[16:22:15] <JoeSlack> i think almost every project i contribute to / use has moved to freenode, it's the last bastion of irc
[16:22:27] <JoeSlack> love it.  I hated having to connect to 50 irc servers, 10 years ago
[16:22:49] <tw2113> i connect to 2
[16:22:53] <tw2113> freenode and mozilla's
[16:22:54] <shoky> me 2
[16:23:01] <shoky> freenode/efnet
[16:27:00] <sampaka2> anybody with drupal/jquery experience?
[16:27:42] <tw2113> what's jquery sampaka2
[16:27:46] <shoky> sampaka2: bad question
[16:27:55] <sampaka2> ok ok ;)
[16:28:22] <shoky> nice article, tw2113
[16:28:46] <tw2113> i saw it on twitter earlier, and then later on HN
[16:29:28] <shoky> i thought efnet had declined much more than they show
[16:29:40] <shoky> 4th largest tho
[16:34:34] <sampaka2> i still trying to trigger change event of my select element via jquery - $('#edit-field-paper-credit-layout-und').trigger('change'); - no way to do it - does anybody can think of an alternative to trigger the change event when the selected option is changed.
[16:36:41] <shoky> sampaka2: http://jsfiddle.net/bDEsj/
[16:37:28] <shoky> it doesn't trigger the _native_ event though. so only event handlers set with jquery will catch it
[16:38:59] <sampaka2> maybe thats my problem
[16:39:03] <cj> hey folks, what selector should I use to find elements which contain the string 'foo'?
[16:39:20] <cj> or put more succinctly, how do I match on element values in a selector?
[16:39:30] <JoeSlack> :contains
[16:39:37] <shoky> ?:contains
[16:39:38] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[16:40:13] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/B9Nuh/
[16:40:35] <cj> danke
[16:41:22] <shoky> GoSox:  what about $(this).remove();
[16:42:05] <GoSox> ill try that now. but i suspect it will be the same, because i can clearly see the item that is supposed to be removed, sitting in my page, with the correct ID and everything
[16:42:10] <GoSox> but can't hurt to try
[16:42:32] <shoky> GoSox: do you have multiple elements with the same ID?
[16:42:38] <GoSox> nope
[16:42:45] <sampaka2> shoky: what would be an alternative for event handlers not set with jquery?
[16:42:49] <shoky> GoSox: ok, reproduce the issue on jsfiddle
[16:43:10] <GoSox> easier said than done
[16:43:19] <shoky> can't help much otherwise
[16:43:20] <JoeSlack> tried it with a hardcoded ID instead of your dynamic var?
[16:43:36] <JoeSlack> try applying a style to the element too - to make sure selector is working?
[16:43:46] <shoky> or.. debug it
[16:43:52] <shoky> with a debugger, or console.log
[16:44:11] <shoky> console.log prolly more useful in this case
[16:44:23] <shoky> inside the event handler, not outside
[16:44:27] <GoSox> shoky i'm using console.log, that's how i know the correct id is getting the remove() command, it's just not removing it
[16:44:30] <shoky> inside.
[16:44:38] <shoky> where the remove happens..
[16:44:52] <shoky> and dont just log the id
[16:45:00] <GoSox> what else should i log?
[16:45:03] <shoky> log the jquery object, its length, etc
[16:45:21] <shoky> console.log( $($tobeaxed).length )  for example
[16:45:35] <shoky> and the id too
[16:46:14] <JoeSlack> http://jsfiddle.net/B9Nuh/1/  that works..
[16:46:40] <shoky> working fiddle wont help ;p
[16:47:24] <JoeSlack> huh?  it's a good idea to debug without dynamic variables
[16:47:26] <cj> is it possible to select by ID and name match at the same time, for instance, $('#bar[name=~"baz"')?  Forget for a moment that selection by id should return a single element
[16:47:46] <cj> I guess I could write me some html and find out, huh?
[16:47:51] <JoeSlack> work backwards with debugging - that's the point
[16:48:25] <JoeSlack> cj ya
[16:48:28] <shoky> JoeSlack: sorry i thought you were GoSox
[16:48:34] <GoSox> yeah that's why i can't fiddle it. it will work in a fiddle. but in the wild, with the script actually loading data from an external page, inserting it into my list, then deleting old items from the list, at random times and at random rates of items, i get these blips where remove() doesn't work
[16:48:52] <GoSox> right now i'm waiting to see if $(this) makes a difference
[16:48:56] <JoeSlack> so weird... have you tried removing your dynamic variable tho gosox?  and hardcode id?
[16:49:20] <GoSox> i can't hard code it, it doesn't exist until it's inserted dynamically
[16:49:24] <shoky> $(this)  is better anyway
[16:49:49] <shoky> GoSox: and is that the only line of code that touches $tobeaxed ?
[16:50:23] <GoSox> yes, i pull $tobeaxed from the array, i slide it up, which works 100% of the time, and when that animation is done, i remove it
[16:50:30] <GoSox> and about 90-95% of the time, it works
[16:50:35] <shoky> array..
[16:50:47] <shoky> you do it multiple times?
[16:50:58] <shoky> changing $tobeaxed each time?
[16:51:07] <mmanrique> I might look like a slowpoke right now
[16:51:16] <mmanrique> but didi you guys see the new UI in the jquery page?
[16:51:17] <GoSox> yes
[16:51:27] <shoky> yes to me?
[16:51:30] <GoSox> yes to you
[16:51:30] <mmanrique> at least on the http://api.jquery.com/
[16:51:35] <shoky> then.. that's the reason
[16:51:39] <shoky> probably.
[16:51:40] <GoSox> what do you mean?
[16:51:46] <shoky> by the time the slideUp is done,
[16:51:51] <shoky> $tobeaxed has already changed
[16:52:01] <shoky> in a nutshell..
[16:52:10] <GoSox> hmmmm
[16:52:52] <GoSox> in that case, $(this) will have actually fixed the problem then?
[16:52:57] <shoky> probably
[16:53:04] <GoSox> no errors yet, we shall see
[16:54:06] <GoSox> if i'm going going to use $tobeaxed once, i can just skip it all together and do $( "#v" + $list_alias.shift() ).slideUp( etc )
[16:54:14] <GoSox> save some bytes
[16:56:13] <GoSox> shoky: so what happens is that every 1.5 seconds, javascript loads a php file with any number of new rows of data, could be zero, could be one, sometimes it could be more than one.
[16:56:37] <GoSox> so in javascript, i loop through those new rows of data, adding them to the top of my list, then deleting the older items in the list, on a 1:1 ratio
[16:56:46] <GoSox> add one, remove one, repeat
[16:56:56] <GoSox> so your explanation makes sense
[16:57:46] <shoky> yeap. is your loop a simple for/while loop?
[16:57:57] <GoSox> a for loop
[16:58:18] <shoky> yah. and you've got  'var $tobeaxed..'  inside the loop?
[16:58:45] <GoSox> i don't have var $tobeaxed
[16:58:48] <GoSox> i just use it
[16:58:54] <GoSox> i'm a php'er at heart :)
[16:59:02] <GoSox> but so far so good
[16:59:11] <GoSox> although i ahven't seen any multiples yet so tough to say
[16:59:13] <shoky> heh..
[16:59:22] <GoSox> here's the actual page if you want to see it in action
[16:59:23] <GoSox> http://www.menulizard.com/live/
[16:59:32] <shoky> the $(this)  will solve this problem but if you're not careful you'll have other similar probs
[16:59:34] <GoSox> the data is coming in slow this time of night though
[17:00:14] <shoky> what's best is to have local variables inside the loop, and in javascript you can only have local variables inside a local function
[17:03:15] <GoSox> yup just did a little curl stress test, seems to handle lumps of data fine now
[17:03:51] <shoky> GoSox: see ?each

[17:04:27] <shoky> GoSox ^^
[17:05:30] <GoSox> are you suggesting this for something specific in my code orrrr?
[17:05:33] <shoky> $.each( $new_menu, function(i, menu) { ... $(menu).prependTo("menu_stream_list") ... })
[17:05:59] <GoSox> oh i see
[17:06:07] <shoky> and use 'var' to define new variables
[17:06:17] <shoky> dont "just use them"
[17:06:24] <shoky> you'll just be asking for pain later on :P
[17:06:35] <shoky> er that came out wrong , but you catch my drift ;p
[17:08:10] <shoky> you don't have any menus for restaurants in my area :(
[17:08:19] <GoSox> shoky: what area is that?
[17:08:26] <shoky> tel-aviv :\
[17:08:33] <GoSox> yes that is correct, i do not
[17:08:35] <shoky> ;p
[17:08:44] <shoky> i want MENUS!
[17:09:15] <GoSox> there are enough menus in my country, to keep my busy for eternity
[17:09:30] <shoky> indeed
[17:09:33] <GoSox> so shit i think this page is completely finished now
[17:09:45] <shoky> shit
[17:11:53] <shoky> GoSox: how's business?
[17:12:05] <GoSox> depends on what you mean by that
[17:12:11] <shoky> not a bad stream of views
[17:12:12] <GoSox> whatsmyip.org is making tons of money :D
[17:12:15] <gry> could you pretty please find an example of jqplot line graph that would take [['one',1],['two',2]] and plot a line graph with x ticks labels?
[17:12:22] <shoky> well i meant from this one
[17:12:33] <gry> i tried following few examples without success
[17:12:34] <GoSox> menulizard is free all around, and doesn't get nearly enough traffic to make any significant revenue
[17:12:38] <gry> ...
[17:12:48] <GoSox> hopefully that changes with this site redesign, its really a nice site now
[17:12:58] <GoSox> shoky: a year ago, this was the site: http://old.menulizard.com
[17:13:22] <GoSox> don't view source or you'll cry
[17:13:30] <shoky> ;]
[17:13:39] <GoSox> but in my defense, it was 2005
[17:14:24] <shoky> it's ok, i've seen plenty worse , from 2012 ;]
[17:15:00] <GoSox> html5 has really changed everything for me
[17:15:28] <GoSox> i never would have guessed, but these days, i to tiny tiny piece of html and php, and huge blocks of javascript and css
[17:15:34] <GoSox> who would have thought
[17:20:58] <gry> i have this data and this js http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2038954 but the graph contains few points on a vertical lines
[17:21:05] <gry> a vertical line too
[17:21:08] <gry> got ideas ?
[17:27:34] <gry> i can't even get the example to work ... http://www.jqplot.com/deploy/dist/examples/date-axes.html
[17:39:41] <yousaf_> hi all, i have an image and I want to set its opacity to 30% after 2 seconds but with a nice graceful animation
[17:41:33] <yousaf_> damn it, looks simple
[17:47:18] <djshotglass> can i select based on css?
[17:47:34] <djshotglass> $('position: relative')
[17:48:21] <JoeSlack> u mean like  $("#element[css=position:relative]");  that would be cool, but i dont know if there's a way
[17:48:29] <JoeSlack> u can use  hasCss
[17:48:44] <JoeSlack> hasClass*
[17:57:20] <hugo_moss> anyone recommend a nice jquery fade in/out drop down menu?
[17:58:55] <gry> jqplot suggests '%b %#d, %#I %p' format for date strings, is it documented somewhere? javascript standard or jquery standard or specific to jqplot?
[17:59:56] <raj> ajpiano, ping
[18:01:50] <coldhead|GYM> that's jqplot, gry
[18:02:09] <raj> LMAO!
[18:02:20] <shoky> lol :)
[18:02:45] <shoky> gry: your code is all wrong in that paste ;p
[18:03:05] <gry> feedback welcome
[18:03:15] <djshotglass> i need to loop though every element in the document
[18:03:25] <djshotglass> $('*').each(function(i, e){/*e is not the element here*/});
[18:03:48] <gry> shoky: ie i have no idea what's wrong with it, if you could be more specific it would help
[18:04:17] <raj> what's going on shoky?
[18:04:31] <shoky> gry: should be something more like  http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2038996
[18:04:55] <shoky> k raj nothin much. wusup
[18:05:26] <raj> just bought a MBP
[18:05:31] <raj> returning it tomorrow
[18:05:54] <shoky> it sucks?
[18:05:56] <raj> i can't believe people feel productive on a machine that can't be customized at all
[18:06:01] <shoky> hehe
[18:06:07] <raj> no keyboard shortcuts
[18:06:13] <shoky> hmm
[18:06:17] <raj> for like window management
[18:06:29] <raj> no custom gestures
[18:06:33] <gry> shoky: thanks
[18:06:34] <shoky> that doesnt sound right..
[18:06:39] <shoky> not that i'd know
[18:06:42] <shoky> but it sounds fishy
[18:06:46] <raj> that's what I thought
[18:07:03] <shoky> it's osx, ye?
[18:07:06] <raj> plus everything costs money
[18:07:11] <raj> yeah
[18:07:21] <raj> I like the granular customizability that comes with linux
[18:07:30] <raj> and I can run inifinite macros with autohotkey
[18:07:43] <shoky> yah its unixy, isn't like.. everything customizable
[18:08:03] <raj> ...with windows
[18:08:14] <shoky> wat?
[18:08:15] <b-ot> give me the fucking unban i you can break forever
[18:08:28] <raj> *and I can run infinite macros with autohotkey in windows
[18:09:45] <shoky> don't really understand what it is you can't do in osx..
[18:09:59] <shoky> don't people do everything in osx including being productive, these days
[18:10:11] <raj> can't create any fancy kb shortcuts, can't create custom gestures
[18:10:30] <shoky> what makes you so sure..
[18:10:37] <raj> even the granularity of touchpad control is shitty
[18:10:43] <raj> synaptec blows them out the water
[18:11:52] <shoky> welp i hate touchpads anyway
[18:12:37] <raj> exactly, and no granular kb shortcuts
[18:12:42] <raj> like, macros should be possible
[18:12:51] <shoky> what makes you so sure they're not?
[18:14:33] <shoky> why you be hatin' ;]
[18:15:13] <shoky> and.. i didnt understand that 'exactly'
[18:15:20] <shoky> windows has.. better touchpads..?
[18:17:29] <hugo_moss> mac = numero uno
[18:17:38] <hugo_moss> applefanboy here
[18:23:05] <gry> shoky: my own data still plots things on one vertical line ... ... err i don't even see how is my own data (as seen in my paste) different from the data in the example ?
[18:25:22] <shoky> gry: your dates don't have time.. no idea if that has to do with your problem
[18:26:19] <shoky> gry: also they're doing:   var line1=[[..], [..], ...]    then  $.jqplot('chart1', [line1], ...
[18:26:32] <sampaka2> shoky: i am still with my change event issue. just read this: Both IE and FF won't fire 'onchange' when the current selection in a select box is modified with javascript. Beside, the js function wich changes the selection is part of framework so I can't change it to trigger an onchange() at then end for example
[18:26:37] <shoky> so maybe you need another []  around it, no idea. never used it myself
[18:27:12] <sampaka2> so all the change() or trigger('change') only works when the user change the select option by himself
[18:27:23] <shoky> sampaka2:  what is it exactly that you want to happen when you do .trigger('change')  ?
[18:27:48] <shoky> emphasis on _exactly_
[18:28:02] <shoky> saying "i want it to run the event handler" is NOT what i mean by exact
[18:28:09] <sampaka2> the form fires a ajax callback function
[18:28:56] <shoky> i dont know what form you're talking about and what ajax has to do with the issue of a 'change' event
[18:28:56] <sampaka2> sorry for beeing not to precise - i am new to jquery - from 0 to 100 in 2 days ;)
[18:29:01] <jtsternberg> i have a quick question.. are these two things the same? http://b.ustin.co/fjq8
[18:29:29] <shoky> jtsternberg: similar but not the same
[18:29:32] <jtsternberg> does the hide_scanner function need quotes?
[18:29:45] <shoky> jtsternberg: no, they're both valid
[18:29:53] <shoky> and in many cases they'll behave exactly the same
[18:29:59] <jtsternberg> but it will accomplish the same thing, right?
[18:30:01] <shoky> not always
[18:30:05] <jtsternberg> ah ok
[18:30:19] <shoky> for example, the first one passes the 'event' object as argument to hide_scanner
[18:30:21] <jtsternberg> when would it not?
[18:30:23] <shoky> but the second one doesn't
[18:30:37] <jtsternberg> really?
[18:30:40] <jtsternberg> that's good to know
[18:30:51] <jtsternberg> which doesn't matter if I don't need the event, right?
[18:31:02] <shoky> yeah
[18:31:14] <gry> shoky: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2039027
[18:31:23] <tw2113> jtsternberg, first calls hide_scanner() directly
[18:31:32] <tw2113> 2nd creates an anon function that calls it
[18:31:45] <shoky> jtsternberg: another example is if hide_scanner is not defined yet when the .bind is run
[18:31:57] <alwayslearning> hey guys good evening, can anyone help me figure out why my lightbox wont pop up on page load? I get this error when looking at the resources in Chrome Inspector: Uncaught TypeError:Object #<Object> has no method 'ageBlock'
[18:32:00] <shoky> then the first one will fail, and the second one will work, as soon as hide_scanner is defined
[18:32:00] <relipse> i'm trying to set all my form values, but how do I do it for radio buttons and checkboxes?
[18:32:04] <alwayslearning> site url: www.quiquor.com
[18:32:49] <jtsternberg> shoky: hmm I assume that would raise a console, error, right?
[18:32:58] <jtsternberg> so i can verify it's working
[18:33:03] <shoky> gry: sorry i don't know jqplot at all.. all you have to do is follow the examples/docs _exactly_
[18:33:36] <sampaka2> shoky: for what i have read there is no direct way to trigger the change event when the select option is changed programmaticaly
[18:33:49] <shoky> jtsternberg:  i dont think that:  $(document).bind('whatever', something_undefined)  will throw an error
[18:34:09] <jtsternberg> so it's better off to use the second method, so i know it will run?
[18:34:17] <shoky> sampaka2:  not the native change event, right
[18:34:43] <shoky> jtsternberg: i'd usually use the first ;P and make sure that its defined beforehand.. you prolly dont have to worry about it
[18:35:10] <sampaka2> my ajax callback function seems to depend on this native change event
[18:35:14] <jtsternberg> shoky: And it would be defined if the file with the 'wds_closepopup' was called before this one, right?
[18:35:19] <relipse> i'm trying to set all my form values, but how do I do it for radio buttons and checkboxes?
[18:35:45] <shoky> jtsternberg:  if that file defines it in the scope that's accessible from the other file, then yes ;P
[18:35:46] <alwayslearning> hey guys, for some reason i can't get this ageblocking lightbox to load on my site : www.quiquor.com            I get the error Uncaught TypeError:Object #<Object> has no method 'ageBlock'
[18:36:06] <jtsternberg> ha ha.. clear as mud. :)
[18:36:36] <jtsternberg> maybe you'd be willing to explain to me how I would "make sure it is defined beforehand" ")
[18:36:44] <shoky> jtsternberg: uhh wds_closepopup is just the event name...
[18:36:50] <shoky> that doesn't need to be defined
[18:37:05] <jtsternberg> ha right.. good point
[18:37:25] <jtsternberg> the hide_scanner function is right below this line. Should it be before?
[18:37:51] <shoky> no that's fine, function and variable declarations are "hoisted" to the top of the current scope
[18:38:07] <jtsternberg> this is the relevant code: http://b.ustin.co/xLjK
[18:38:08] <shoky> as if you declared them at the top
[18:39:59] <shoky> jtsternberg: it looks ok..
[18:40:13] <jtsternberg> shoky: happy to hear any criticism
[18:40:54] <shoky> jtsternberg:  well why not be consistent with which of those 2 ways you're choosing ;p
[18:41:08] <alwayslearning> hey guys, for some reason i can't get this ageblocking lightbox to load on my site : www.quiquor.com            I get the error Uncaught TypeError:Object #<Object> has no method 'ageBlock'
[18:41:12] <shoky> jtsternberg: your code has both ways  (lines 9 and 13)
[18:41:28] <jtsternberg> yah, sorry, uploaded the wrong thing.. meant to do http://b.ustin.co/YQ2l
[18:42:19] <shoky> jtsternberg: looks fine. that show_hide_scanner is a bit weird but i guess you have a reason to do that shit
[18:42:32] <jtsternberg> ha ha yah, it is weird
[18:42:59] <jtsternberg> it's for an ios app, so yah
[18:43:13] <bambanx> guys anyone hknow a script for get the time weather form a location , but it will change all days without reload the page, how i can do pls ?
[18:44:03] <alwayslearning> Someone please help me get this lightbox working, for some reason i can't get this ageblocking lightbox to load on my site : www.quiquor.com            I get the error Uncaught TypeError:Object #<Object> has no method 'ageBlock'
[18:44:10] <jtsternberg> shoky: since the event is passed to the hide_scanner function, is there a way to pull info out of the event to know which object caused the event? make sense?
[18:44:45] <shoky> jtsternberg: i'd prolly go with:  $('<iframe>').attr('src', 'dma://' + showhide).appendTo(document.documentElement).remove()
[18:44:54] <shoky> one-line that bitch ;p
[18:45:32] <shoky> jtsternberg: yeah you can check the event object for stuff like that, but for the clicked object you can simply use 'this'
[18:45:34] <jtsternberg> Ha, i like that idea
[18:46:26] <jtsternberg> yah, i'm looking for a way to duplicate the 'this' functionality in the bind event
[18:46:54] <jtsternberg> shoky: ^
[18:48:51] <ryanneufeld> jtsternberg: do you know about call() and apply()?
[18:48:59] <jtsternberg> no
[18:49:03] <bambanx> any idea pls?

[18:50:17] <ryanneufeld> jtsternberg: jquery uses those internally
[18:50:40] <Drod> hi
[18:50:43] <ryanneufeld> jtsternberg: which is why this is always the context of the thing that you've bound to, or that triggered the event
[18:50:50] <jtsternberg> ok, so it uses one when calling it inline, and uses the other for the second way?
[18:51:02] <Drod> any suggest for best tiny jquery plugin for validate form??
[18:51:37] <ryanneufeld> bambanx: google man, You're gonna need to pull from several apis for that. If you get something started and have a specific question about jquery, come and ask here :)

[19:36:38] <RohanBhangui> hi guys in jquery there is $.ajax.....does any one know how to get content from a div (with id=foo) by using $.ajax 's responseText
[19:38:37] <RohanBhangui> ???
[19:41:41] <RohanBhangui> anyone there?

[19:44:13] <alwayslearning> hey guys, for some reason i can't get this ageblocking lightbox to load on my site : www.quiquor.com            I get the error Uncaught TypeError:Object #<Object> has no method 'ageBlock'
[19:45:03] <yousaf_> Is it possible to access the value of a JS variable from an iframe?
[19:48:07] <RohanBhangui> hi guys in jquery there is $.ajax.....does any one know how to get content from a div (with id=foo) by using $.ajax 's responseText
[19:50:13] <wroathe> alwayslearning: You're including jquery twice in a row on that page
[19:51:01] <wroathe> alwayslearning: Actually you're including it three times.
[19:51:25] <alwayslearning> the ageblocker script requires an older version
[19:51:31] <alwayslearning> @wroather
[19:51:56] <wroathe> alwayslearning: So why are you including it three times?
[19:54:26] <wroathe> alwayslearning: So what's going on is that you've got one jquery loading, your plugin extends jqueries' prototype, and then you load another jquery and undo the previous change.
[19:57:03] <wroathe> alwayslearning: Also, there's really no excuse for using three different jqueries on any page ever.
[19:58:59] <alwayslearning> i see, do you think i could just include the latest version? @wroathe
[20:01:36] <wroathe> alwayslearning: Well, if you absolutely need to use a plugin that has a hard version dependancy than you'll have to do any one of a few things: find a new plugin, use just the required and keep the plugin, use the required version and a new version for everything else.
[20:02:02] <wroathe> alwayslearning: If it were me I'd avoid using plugins that require old versions of jquery. That's a good sign the project isn't actively maintained.
[20:14:00] <gry> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2039236 says missing } after property list at line 10, but in the second snippet, line 33 works, ideas why ?

[20:17:57] <bambanx> ryanneufeld, for my problem for show the weather all days without reloading the page , can be done refresing my div ( the div weather ) to for example one hour? using ajax?
[20:21:50] <bambanx> any help pls?
[20:22:50] <tw2113> ajax and cron
[20:23:14] <tw2113> if you can find a weather provider that gives a json endpoint, you'd be in business pretty easy
[20:33:03] <shoky> wtf just happened to jsfiddle..
[20:33:28] <shoky> i was doin some forking
[20:33:34] <shoky> and it broke :(
[20:40:46] <tw2113> see what happens when you fork with jsfiddle?
[20:42:05] <shoky> boohoo
[20:42:13] <shoky> and wah
[20:46:21] <shoky> oh my
[20:46:27] <shoky> it's back, with a new look
[20:46:36] <shoky> or something
[20:48:28] <shoky> can it be.. did they fix the invisible invalid char at the end thing
[20:49:10] <shoky> and the indenting
[20:49:36] <shoky> yeh codemirror
[20:57:03] <nmuntz_> how can i make a nested div have all the available space left in its parent div? see example here: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0u - i would like to make the blue div to take all 100% space
[21:00:05] <someprimetime> wtf
[21:00:08] <someprimetime> i don't go on jsfiddle for one day
[21:00:11] <someprimetime> and it's changed
[21:00:24] <someprimetime> autocomplete on html tags
[21:00:26] <someprimetime> ncie
[21:00:29] <someprimetime> s/ci/ic
[21:00:40] <someprimetime> formatting for js got fixed it looks like
[21:00:45] <someprimetime> thank you jsfiddle for being my favorite
[21:00:54] <someprimetime> although those buttons look not like buttons
[21:00:57] <shoky> yea they just changed it 20 min ago
[21:01:27] <someprimetime> actually it's fucked up
[21:01:34] <someprimetime> they must still be deploying or something
[21:02:14] <someprimetime> we just had this conversation about the best collaboration editing tool
[21:02:18] <someprimetime> and someone was saying jsfiddle is losing it
[21:02:34] <someprimetime> i knew they'd update soon
[21:02:42] <shoky> nmuntz_: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0v
[21:02:47] <someprimetime> http://i.imgur.com/8qdVh.png
[21:03:04] <someprimetime> damn that's leet
[21:03:30] <someprimetime> brighter colors not bad jsfiddle
[21:05:19] <shoky> ahhh finally tidyup button also tidies the html
[21:05:50] <shoky> and the css
[21:06:34] <someprimetime> yep
[21:06:42] <someprimetime> still the best editor
[21:06:47] <someprimetime> WE STILL DA BEST MAYNE
[21:07:36] <tw2113> jsbin is dee better
[21:08:00] <someprimetime> nah i don't like the vertical panes
[21:08:06] <tw2113> that's what i like
[21:08:13] <someprimetime> no :vsp for me
[21:08:18] <shoky> i like choice
[21:08:25] <someprimetime> no i like one and only one
[21:08:30] <someprimetime> north korea and jsfiddle
[21:08:32] <tw2113> vertical panes and easy toggle
[21:08:35] <someprimetime> okay that's 2 technically
[21:08:46] <shoky> saw a nice one a few days ago that lets you do both horiz&vert
[21:08:53] <shoky> dont remember the name
[21:09:16] <tw2113> shoky, ever seen the 2011 movie Sucker Punch?
[21:10:27] <mitzev_> hey all
[21:10:32] <shoky> tw2113 dont think so
[21:10:39] <mitzev_> how can i delay loading of images unti viewport is on them?
[21:10:48] <mitzev_> is there a known plugin for this?
[21:10:54] <mitzev_> until*
[21:11:09] <ryanneufeld> mitzev_: try googling for lazy loading
[21:11:20] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: I've seen it
[21:11:20] <tw2113> ^
[21:11:49] <tw2113> i'm liking it for what it's worth ryanneufeld
[21:12:00] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: If you take it for what it is
[21:12:05] <ryanneufeld> it's a great movie
[21:12:15] <mitzev_> ryanneufeld, thanks that's what i'm looking for.
[21:12:16] <ryanneufeld> but honestly, I had hard time following what was going on
[21:12:35] <ryanneufeld> mitzev_: anytime you need someone to tell you to use google, I'm your man
[21:12:49] <tw2113> any time you need someone to use duckduckgo, ask me
[21:12:57] <ryanneufeld> mitzev_: or woman, if that helps, but there are no women on the internet
[21:12:58] <shoky> ah it was tinker.io
[21:12:59] <mitzev_> no bing love?
[21:13:07] <ryanneufeld> bing can suck a dick
[21:13:15] <tw2113> we can ask you if we need told to bing something mitzev_
[21:13:33] <ryanneufeld> My personal opinion, and does not represent the rest of #jquery
[21:14:23] <ryanneufeld> OH @ jquery conf SF 2011 "You google your friends wives, and bing your own"
[21:15:41] <shoky> heh
[21:16:43] <mitzev_> i didnt know the term 'lazy loading'
[21:17:44] <mitzev_> is there a plugin or generic piece of code for a floating header, or side menu/box, that stays in position as viewport is scrolled down and up?
[21:18:41] <tw2113> css fixed positioning
[21:19:09] <mitzev_> nothing todo with js?
[21:19:56] <tw2113> i'm sure there are js plugins that do the same thing
[21:25:26] <wubino> Can I get a sticky footer using javascript?  live @ http://dl.dropbox.com/u/33379439/website/stickfooter/initializr/index.html
[21:25:48] <shoky> o.o
[21:34:17] <ziyadb> Good morning!
[21:36:09] <defaultro> hey guys, do you think I'm in bad position. I built a site and fixed so many issues back in June 2012. I sent them my invoice. I've emailed the person many times even upto 2 weeks ago and he just kept promising he will send it. Last week, I changed the site to under maintenance. It was only today he noticed it. Looks like he wants to sue me for doing it. Am I in bad position?
[21:39:53] <Cronoh> did you send him notices that his service would be shut off if he didnt pay
[21:40:00] <defaultro> no
[21:40:20] <Cronoh> have u already turned it back on
[21:40:23] <defaultro> no
[21:40:26] <nightfly_> Did he ever pay you for the services you provided at all?
[21:40:38] <defaultro> for this one, he never paid any
[21:40:53] <defaultro> it was even $2k and i gave him a chance, I brought it even down to $1k :(
[21:41:12] <defaultro> I have all the emails kept
[21:41:28] <defaultro> if he ever sues me, I will search for a really good lawyer
[21:41:29] <nightfly_> You're probably fine, he just wants to scare you.
[21:41:34] <defaultro> k
[21:41:59] <defaultro> i'm sure he is scaring me because they don't know the password. He said my ip was logged
[21:42:09] <defaultro> the server were it is at is at my friend's colo
[21:42:40] <defaultro> more than 6 months of wait :(
[21:42:45] <nightfly_> Is the server in your name?
[21:42:48] <defaultro> no
[21:42:57] <tw2113> oh clients
[21:42:58] <defaultro> they don't own it
[21:43:05] <defaultro> yes, clients
[21:43:07] <defaultro> :)
[21:43:18] <defaultro> they just host their web app at my friend's colo
[21:47:34] <defaultro> friggin ebay, they're stealing money from us, lol
[21:47:56] <defaultro> i sold a lens, then Paypal charged me $10. Now I got an email from Ebay, they're going to charge me $30
[21:49:06] <systemfault> WEEKEND YEAH!
[21:49:13] <systemfault> (I had to say it :/ )
[21:56:17] <raj> systemfault, the issue was a crappy jqui plugin I was using to allow minimizing of dialogs
[21:56:23] <raj> that was giving it a height of 0
[21:56:26] <raj> had to remove the plugin
[21:56:30] <systemfault> arg
[21:56:34] * systemfault cries
[21:56:43] <aj910martin> $('*',document) -> retrieves a list of all dom elements whereas $('*', document.body) retrieves  only the ones within the body, then why does't let's say $('*', document.canvas) return the ones within canvas?
[21:56:46] <raj> it was assessing the dialog's contents before the contents were loaded from the DOM
[21:57:01] <systemfault> raj: Glad you found the problem :)
[21:57:31] <raj> actually shoky found it
[21:59:01] <tw2113> oh sure blame shoky
[21:59:07] <ziyadb> heh.
[21:59:11] <ziyadb> good morning all!
[21:59:28] <defaultro> aj910martin, I always forgot what this syntax does var somevar = $('<div>somestring</div>');
[21:59:34] <mmanrique> aj910martin: problem is that the document itself doesn't have a member which name is canvas
[21:59:35] <defaultro> forget
[21:59:48] <mmanrique> document for example, has body, form, etc
[21:59:58] <mmanrique> but doesn't have by default a canvas member
[22:00:02] <defaultro> i know that somevar will become an object
[22:00:21] <defaultro> however, it becomes a huge object
[22:01:05] <mmanrique> defaultro: you mean the jquery wrapper?
[22:01:17] <mmanrique> defaultro: with a bunch of methods?
[22:03:45] <aj910martin> mmanrique: It doesn't but for general conventions it's a bit misleading to have document.body and not document.foo_elementâ¦ I understand document as everything starting from html, head, titleâ¦ and document.body returns from body onwards
[22:06:00] <mmanrique> aj910martin:well, that's how the document was defined. the standard add only some methods and some properties to the document, it's up to each page to add them if they want to. for example, jquery add the $ property to the document, that's why sometime people use document.jquery
[22:06:07] <mmanrique> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp
[22:08:53] <mmanrique> so, if you want to select all the elements inside a canvas
[22:09:03] <mmanrique> you could use $('canvas > *')
[22:09:10] <mmanrique> I believe that works
[22:09:17] <mmanrique> oooooooor
[22:09:30] <mmanrique> $('canvas *')
[22:10:29] <mmanrique> or, i think this one is right $('canvas').find('*')
[22:11:02] <mmanrique> The last one seems to be faster since (as per jQuery documentation): The all, or universal, selector is extremely slow, except when used by itself.
[22:11:48] <aj910martin> Great! Can you share the link where you read about the efficiency ?
[22:12:57] <mmanrique> http://api.jquery.com/all-selector/
[22:16:43] <aj910martin> mmanrique: What if I want to attach certain event listeners to canvas and I don't know the id or name of it?
[22:30:35] <ziyadb> Quick question. I wish to delete a certain element from its parent.
[22:30:49] <ziyadb> $("parent").remove($("child")); didn't work.
[22:31:09] <aj910martin> mmanrique: What if I want to attach certain event listeners to canvas and I don't know the id or name of it?
[22:31:13] <systemfault> child.remove();
[22:32:46] <mmanrique> aj910martin:so what do you know from it? does it matter if you add the event to all the canvas?
[22:33:01] <mmanrique> you could just select all the canvas with $('canvas')
[22:33:36] <wubino> Can I get a sticky footer using javascript?  live @ http://dl.dropbox.com/u/33379439/website/stickfooter/initializr/index.html
[22:33:50] <mmanrique> and attach events to all of them, but if it's an specific canvas,then what kind of information do we have from it?
[22:33:54] <systemfault> You can with CSSâ¦
[22:34:22] <aj910martin> mmanrique: We know it is the first and only canvas on the page
[22:34:33] <mmanrique> "only canvas"
[22:34:41] <aj910martin> mmanrique: Yes
[22:34:49] <mmanrique> then just use $('canvas').on(........)
[22:36:50] <aj910martin> mmanrique: Works. Thanks!
[22:37:01] <mmanrique> np
[22:37:21] <defaultro> mmanrique, sorry, just got back. I am not sure. Maybe it's called jquery wrapper
[22:37:45] <relipse> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL <--- what?? why did i get that
[22:38:07] <mmanrique> missing a semi colon? a quote mark?
[22:39:18] <relipse> hmmm maybe
[22:39:26] <ziyadb> stephan48: thanks.
[22:39:27] <mmanrique> defaulttro: that's how jquery adds events, basically it's just an object (with some fancy methods) that haves more objects (the dom elements)
[22:41:04] <wubino> Question: my idea is to use js to get the view port size and then reset the layout is this feasabile?
[22:41:17] <wubino> clarification of my original question
[22:42:35] <mmanrique> wubino: what do you mean reset the layout?
[22:43:26] <ziyadb> mmanrique: probably make it "responsive".
[22:43:50] <JoeSlack> thats so vague lol
[22:43:54] <mmanrique> lol
[22:44:06] <mmanrique> css regions work there?
[22:44:12] <mmanrique> I mean, css querys
[22:45:02] <defaultro> thanks mmanrique
[22:45:07] <relipse> mmanrique: thanks dudde! that was it
[22:45:24] <defaultro> what is the advantage of doing it that way? Why do we want it to be assigned to an object?
[22:48:02] <wubino> mmanrique:  I want to get the footer to the bootm of the view port if the page does not have enough content
[22:48:06] <mmanrique> well, you only do a $('query').click() and the click event will propagate over all the elements the 'query' had selected. basically it goes through all of the elements (like a facade)
[22:48:09] <wubino> bottom
[22:49:36] <wubino> im a python programmer (no not django) very new to front end everything
[22:50:40] <mmanrique> np dude. You mean to show the footer if the page is missing content at the bottom?
[22:52:51] <wubino> mmanrique:  yes.  I am trying to get a "sticky footer" or show the footer at the bottom of the viewport
[22:53:09] <systemfault> wubino: You can do that with CSS only...
[22:53:28] <systemfault> wubino: Using JS to do something that CSS can do is plainly bad.
[22:53:52] <systemfault> wubino: Example http://www.pud.ca/misc/testcase/fullheight.html
[22:53:56] <mmanrique> wubino: does this work for you? http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/
[23:01:23] <Whiskey> Anyone here good on jquery
[23:03:12] <wubino> mmanrique:  almost, since it is a responsive design I am having problems when the screen is small, the footer stays presented at the bottom of the viewport and not at the bottom of the content
[23:03:59] <wubino> clarification: stays on in place from the initial viewport
[23:04:13] <Whiskey> have problem whit this one http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/39/
[23:05:34] <TheEmpath> hi... i have an element and the click and mouseleave events work fine.  But when I add mouseenter, the mouseenter event works, but the click and mouseleave event stop working.  any ideas?
[23:11:33] <mmanrique> wubino:I don't have a device to test it, do you have it live in any site?
[23:11:55] <wubino> live @ http://dl.dropbox.com/u/33379439/website/stickfooter/initializr/index.html
[23:13:02] <mmanrique> oh, ok. let me see what I can figure out
[23:18:23] <mmanrique> so, on full screen looks good
[23:21:02] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/41/ <--why is it more space on right-side then the left side?
[23:21:17] <Whiskey> i canÂ´t mange to find whats does it
[23:21:25] <wubino> mmanrique:  wide screen looks good, its a mobile first design though
[23:21:32] <wubino> I think that is the problem
[23:21:33] <mmanrique> wubino: use media queries (http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-mediaqueries) add a css query for smaller devices screens and place the following for footer-container = position: relative;bottom: -120px;
[23:22:02] <mmanrique> if you come up with a better solution later, then you can just remove the media query
[23:35:03] <wubino> mmanrique:  thanks.  it almost works... still some edge case issues.  I am surprsized the HTML and css do not have better explicit handing of vertical alignments
[23:35:13] <wubino> Is that a css4 task?
[23:35:35] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/CiCt7o25 Anyone know why the rows not filled out 100% in the box?
[23:36:12] <mmanrique> I'm not a css developer, but I hope they add it
[23:36:33] <mmanrique> wubio: if you have any doubts, I believe there is a #Css channel as well on freenode
[23:44:17] <JoeSlack> vertical alignment is a travesty.
