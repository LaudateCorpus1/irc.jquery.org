[02:38:05] <Baako> hi guys i need help please. I have a drop down list which sents an ajax respone to a php and the php will use the value to start a download process but i DO NOT know how to handle the return process in jquery to start the download process
[02:39:00] <Baako> this is what my jquery looks like http://pastebin.com/v5FqRpYK
[02:39:35] <Baako> and here is my php http://pastebin.com/CA3Vfdcv
[02:40:33] <Baako> the return looks like download.php?file=picture.jpg
[02:41:41] <Baako> how will i handle this in jquery success function please
[02:43:58] <Baako> i have tried return(respone); but it doesn't download
[02:48:00] <Baako> anyone know how to handle this please
[02:48:53] <CrowX-> Baako, make the return value an url to the file you want to download
[02:49:17] <CrowX-> Baako, then echo it instead of returning it
[02:49:25] <CrowX-> and use a click event on it
[02:49:41] <CrowX-> that's what I'd use until I come up with something cleaner
[02:50:36] <Baako> CrowX the return is already a url
[02:51:20] <CrowX-> Baako, then make sure it has an ID, and use $('#theId').trigger('click')
[02:51:45] <CrowX-> you could have the style of the url to display:none if you like too
[02:52:58] <Baako> CrowX i use the standard php fpassthru function
[02:53:00] <Baako> fpassthru($file);
[02:55:21] <Baako> event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[02:57:53] <CrowX-> Baako, I don't know php enough to know what fpassthru function is
[03:12:50] <Baako> CrowX the return is a url so how i make jquery treat the return as url and visit that url?
[03:28:30] <thijsl> hey guys :)
[03:28:32] <thijsl> what's up
[03:29:00] <thijsl> say, i've been wondering and trying a lot concerning an issue
[03:30:00] <thijsl> i'm trying to get my footerto be at the bottom of the page (at all times), but without overlap with the content. When it's fixed, it overlaps. :( been searching stackoverflow for 'hours', but can't find the right solution :o
[03:45:50] <jaccob> anyone have a good link for explaining the various versions of jquery, specifically for IE support?
[04:18:03] <n-a-n> hi all
[04:42:42] <TheWhisper> Anyone here know about https://github.com/browserstate/ajaxify
[04:42:46] <TheWhisper> I'm having trouble implementing it
[04:42:55] <Woet> just ask
[04:43:19] <TheWhisper> Could someone help me with implementing it?
[04:43:20] <TheWhisper> :P
[04:43:31] <TheWhisper> Right now it doesn't do anything ajaxy
[04:43:35] <TheWhisper> It just loads the new page normally
[04:44:25] <Woet> show your code / website
[04:44:33] <TheWhisper> lemme push it
[04:45:46] <TheWhisper> hm
[04:45:52] <TheWhisper> Looks like it's working when live
[04:45:55] <TheWhisper> but not when local...
[04:46:01] <TheWhisper> Lemme experiment with this a bit
[04:46:25] <PyDon> Hi can anyone help me? I am actually a c++ developer so please forgive me stupid JS related questions. I use jquery mobile and have a list which slides perfetly. I have a System.js which Contains everything. How should i implement a link in the List? With a Hash to avoid a reload or should i Place a real link?
[04:47:20] <PyDon> The Problem is Whenever I attach a callback to the link to display a new div the look of the list breaks
[04:47:35] <PyDon> And also the slide from right to left
[05:07:16] <PyDon> Ok I got it. Just one last question. Any chance to pass params from a jquery mobile list?
[05:35:00] <Fenhl> Hello. I want to construct an element with a child and some text. I tried $('<div>').html($('<a>').text('one')).append('<span>two</span>') but that treats the text '<span>two</span>' as HTML
[05:36:58] <systemfault> Fenhl: $(‘<div><a>one</a><span>two</span></div>’) ?
[05:37:42] <Fenhl> systemfault: are the quotes supposed to be like that?
[05:38:11] <systemfault> Probably not, must be colloquy messing them up again
[05:38:21] <systemfault> Use “normal” single or double quotes
[05:42:43] <Fenhl> okay, so you're saying I have to glue the HTML for the element together. seems dirty, but better than having unescaped text
[05:44:06] <Fenhl> actually, no, wait, I can't do that, because my <a> element is already jQuery
[05:44:12] <systemfault> It's not any more dirtier… as in both ways, you're creating nodes from markup
[05:44:57] <systemfault> var elements = $(‘<div><span>two</span></div>’); elements.prepend(myjQueryElement);
[05:45:11] <Fenhl> ah, that works.
[05:45:13] <Fenhl> thanks
[06:42:40] <hesco> yesterday, duch_kazatel suggested that an .on('load', etc) method would not operate on a simple div.  so instead I'm trying:  $('.has_error [type=radio]:checked').on('load', function() {; but still seem unable to trigger this event.  Can anyone please advise me how it is I would do this?  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=AoSnccDlBm  at line 35 of the javascript
[06:43:48] <decx> from the docs: "This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the window object."
[06:44:47] <hesco> decx: but not to a radio set inside a div.
[06:45:13] <decx> is it in that list i just posted?
[06:45:18] <decx> no, so no
[06:45:21] <systemfault> hesco: Don't ever tell us what you want to do.
[06:45:35] <systemfault> hesco: It's not like it would be the sane thing to do.
[06:46:09] <hesco> decx: ok, so how would I get this to reload in a way making the user choose their radio option again?
[06:46:49] <decx> i don't know what you are trying to achieve
[06:47:33] <hesco> when the page reloads after failing server side data validation, I want the radio set to be unset, or unchecked
[06:49:18] <decx> wat
[06:49:30] <decx> $('#myform')[0].reset()
[06:50:06] <hesco> I do not want to reset the entire form, only the radio set
[06:50:22] <hesco> decx: I want to preserve the rest of the data
[06:50:49] <hesco> and I want that limited reset to be conditional on finding the .has_error class in the html
[06:51:18] <systemfault> hesco: Just do it on page .ready?
[06:51:44] <hesco> thanks decx and systemfault.  I will try that.
[06:52:20] <decx> $('input[type="checkbox"]','#form').hasClass('.has_error').attr('checked',false)
[06:53:24] <decx> oh it's a radio button
[06:53:41] <decx> well you can do the rest yourself
[06:53:45] <decx> maybe...
[06:54:05] <systemfault> Also, you might want to use .prop instead of .attr
[06:54:11] <systemfault> Anyway...
[06:54:49] <decx> i'm a pro at forgetting about .prop
[06:55:35] <hesco> This seems to trigger as intended:  $('.has_error').ready( function() { ; THANKS!!!
[06:55:59] <systemfault> wtf.
[06:56:08] <systemfault> .ready only works on the document.

[07:05:18] <rindolf> Hi all.
[07:27:59] <Delizin> Hey all. I am having some difficulty getting an autocomplete script to work. I am using this library http://www.devbridge.com/sourcery/components/jquery-autocomplete/ and it works if I set the local lookup, but when I try to feed it json I don't get any results. I see the request and get back an 200 OK response. Here are the results when I manually navigate to the query page: http://dpaste.com/1786734/
[07:28:14] <Delizin> Would someone mind taking a look at my JSON to see if there is something that I missed maybe?
[07:37:17] <Velveeta> delizin can you put together a demo of some kind so we can see how you're trying to feed that into the autocomplete component?
[07:39:26] <Delizin> Hmm it is all served locally at the moment, but I'm not sure how to put JSON into something like jsfiddle. Is there a preferred way to create an example?
[07:41:38] <Velveeta> well, i'm more interested in how you're instantiating the autocomplete... the json from attempt 1 looks valid in your dpaste example
[07:42:00] <Velveeta> i just want to see what other options you're passing to autocomplete, as well as how you're feeding the json to it
[07:44:31] <Delizin> Velveeta: http://dpaste.com/1786755/ There is a paste of the whole page it is from. The script is at the very bottom
[07:46:38] <Tekla> on server side i had the root folder for all pages (/var/www) any jquery script in a direct subfolder in there works .. but if i try to use ajax call from a level deeper (/var/www/level1/level2/jquery.js) i get internal server error 500 :(
[07:47:09] <Velveeta> tekla: that's not really a jquery question, that's a webserver config question
[07:47:25] <Tekla> :\
[07:48:10] <Tekla> i can access the php file i call from level2 from a browser window
[07:48:33] <Velveeta> that doesn't change the fact that that's not a jquery question...
[07:49:08] <Velveeta> delizin: what you have there looks like it's correct, according to the documentation for autocomplete, so i wouldn't be able to help any further unless i could see a functional demo to actually debug in devtools
[07:49:50] <Delizin> Velveeta: I appreciate you taking a look. I am going to see if I can play around with it in a fiddle and try to make it work.
[07:50:49] <Velveeta> sounds good, you can try looking into something like the mockjax plugin to hijack the ajax function and simulate a callback to an endpoint, to make it work in jsfiddle
[07:57:17] <shoky> Delizin that's not valid JSON
[07:58:06] <Delizin> shoky: That is what I was suspecting. What is the problem with it?
[07:58:27] <shoky> {a:'b'}  should be  {"a":"b"}
[07:58:42] <shoky> http://json.org/
[07:59:13] <Delizin> shoky: Aha! I'll give that a try, thank you. This is my first foray into client side languages. I am much happier with the server side of things
[07:59:25] <shoky> that is, only double-quotes, and keys must be strings
[08:01:06] <Velveeta> if that turns out to be the issue, i'm gonna smack myself.. i'm so used to just writing object literal syntax that i forgot about the nuances of valid json
[08:01:48] <Delizin> That was 100% it
[08:02:05] <Velveeta> i smacked myself
[08:02:05] <Delizin> Thank you shoky and Velveeta. I appreciate the help
[08:03:05] <Velveeta> their documentation needs to be updated to reflect a valid format also
[08:04:03] <Delizin> I'll submit an issue on their git to let them know
[08:12:40] <shoky> oh that's pretty silly of them
[08:14:51] <drej> is it ironic that my jquery shirt started falling appart at the seams?
[08:22:35] <decx> just shedding unnecessary parts, it'S jquery shirt 2.0.0
[09:06:12] <GreekFreak> hi all
[09:06:19] <GreekFreak> I am trying to set the value of a radio button. I have found that I should do 'my_radio.prop("checked", true).checkboxradio("refresh")', yet it complains that "checkboxradio" is not a function
[09:07:34] <BillCriswell> GreekFreak: You want the value submitted to the server to be changed?
[09:07:44] <BillCriswell> Or you just want it to be checked now?
[09:08:02] <decx> checkboxradio is a jquery mobile function
[09:08:19] <GreekFreak> BillCriswell, I want to change it now
[09:08:26] <GreekFreak> decx, oh. I didn't realise taht
[09:10:04] <iLikeYogurt> hello, Why body font not changing ? $('body').css('font-family', theFontVar);
[09:10:29] <decx> impossible to tell without knowing what's in the fontvar
[09:11:10] <iLikeYogurt> i use it the fonts Georgia, FreeSerif , all device fonts on most devices installed already
[09:11:16] <shoky> GreekFreak: you want .button("refresh") instead for jquery-ui's radio. assuming you're using .button() on it
[09:11:23] <rindolf> iLikeYogurt: can you pastebin a reproducing example to jsfiddle or whererver?
[09:12:33] <shoky> GreekFreak: and if it's just a plain non-enhanced radio button.. you don't need any "refresh"
[09:13:23] <GreekFreak> shoky, thanks again. I figured out the problem. as usual, it was a "PEBKAC" (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair)
[09:13:38] <shoky> ;]
[09:14:15] <GreekFreak> :P
[09:15:33] <iLikeYogurt> rindolf- is okay i got now working , no <body> on page
[09:16:03] <rindolf> iLikeYogurt: ah.
[09:16:36] <rindolf> iLikeYogurt: make sure your pages validate.
[09:17:24] <decx> actually in html5 body isn't mandatory
[09:19:20] <iLikeYogurt> rindolf- this is working now http://bpaste.net/show/216329/
[09:20:19] <iLikeYogurt> decx: why ? if i have it no <body> tag is not working
[09:22:02] <decx> it's just an interesting fact that doesn'T have to concern you, also you can just run your function on document ready and don'T have to put onload handlers inline
[09:23:30] <iLikeYogurt> decx- no thanks, i dont like it the document).ready
[09:24:04] <decx> that's up to you, but be aware that fellow developers will point at your back and chuckle
[09:24:57] <iLikeYogurt> decx- what is this back and chuckle thing you are talking now
[09:25:43] <decx> well maybe they will point at your face instead...
[09:26:02] <iLikeYogurt> i dont have it any team of inside developers back and chuckle is impossible
[09:29:05] <krambiorix> does anyone use https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps ? I get an error from google : "too much recursion" ... Anyone any idea?
[09:32:42] <rindolf> krambiorix: can you pastebot your code?
[09:37:11] <krambiorix> rindolf, thanks but i found it
[09:37:28] <rindolf> krambiorix: ah, OK, What was the problem?
[09:39:11] <krambiorix> rindolf, initially i didn't set long & lat . I thought i didn't because i did geocoding after the loading
[09:39:19] <krambiorix> *didn't have to
[09:40:37] <rindolf> krambiorix: ah, I see.
[09:52:59] <alaing> hi ppl
[09:53:24] <alaing> I'm running ubuntu server on a spare machine at home
[09:53:46] <alaing> i'm having problems with permission with a CMS that I'm using
[09:54:02] <alaing> which made me wonder if my configuration is correct
[09:54:15] <Clorith> Wouldn't that be a question for said CMS ?
[09:54:31] <alaing> I know my apache server is using user www-data and user group www-data
[09:55:01] <alaing> I've just noticed that my /var/www is displaying my username for both owner and group
[09:55:14] <alaing> is this correct?
[09:55:22] <alaing> shouldn't it be www-data?
[09:55:34] <erming> sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www
[09:55:43] <erming> but now go away, shoo! this is the wrong channel
[09:56:25] <alaing> lol - sorry...... I thought I was in ubuntu server channel
[09:56:34] <erming> heh :)
[09:56:46] <alaing> note to self : double check which tab i'm in before posting
[09:57:15] <decx> well at least you didnt press "like" on pornhub
[09:57:26] <alaing> pmsl
[09:57:36] <erming> decx, lol
[09:57:58] <alaing> my irc client of choice is chatzilla
[10:04:55] <Uhkis> ubuntu server -.-
[10:18:38] <alaing> ....
[10:32:20] <zylophone> hi, so i'm trying to put together a layout, where i want to drag from one column to another droppable. http://jsfiddle.net/J5JvJ/26/
[10:32:50] <zylophone> it seems i need the overflow for the scrollbar, but that's preventing me from breaking out with the draggable - any ideas please?
[10:42:27] <shoky> zylophone: either make the draggable not be a child of the column div (but a child of #container for example, with different positioning)
[10:43:19] <shoky> zylophone: or you could keep it a child of the column if you want, but put the overflowing text in an element of its own with the overflow css set, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/J5JvJ/34/
[10:43:49] <tandroid> zylophone, I think this is closer to what you want
[10:43:51] <tandroid> http://jsfiddle.net/sAZn6/
[10:46:30] <zylophone> shoky: thanks, but the content in the left content is going to be a list of draggables, so they all will have to be in one div
[10:46:58] <zylophone> tandroid: i see 2 boxes on the top, and one below?
[10:47:24] <tandroid> http://jsfiddle.net/sAZn6/1/
[10:47:26] <tandroid> Better?
[10:49:03] <tandroid> The point is that you can float them rather than position fixed
[10:51:57] <zylophone> tandroid: and how to solve the problem that the draggable is over the content of the first col?
[10:53:14] <tandroid> zylophone Well for that you need to read the jquery ui documentation
[11:06:35] <zylophone> wow, this is nasty! http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/compiled/projects/clone_wars_jquery_ui_draggable.html
[11:19:18] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/J5JvJ/36/ well that was...interesting
[11:21:12] <zylophone> thanks for your help tandroid and shoky
[11:32:39] <phw> I am looking for an easy way to have a page that where users fill out a multiple-choice questionaire and as an answer get a diagram rendered out. What framework can you suggest? I have NO idea about javascript-frameworks.
[11:48:24] <zylophone> phw: i recommend you decide EXACTLY what the problem is before looking for a solution
[11:49:40] <phw> It is a series of questions (multiple choice). The answers cumulate 4 different values that shall be displayed after filling out all questions and aditionally rendered as a graphic (a special kind of diagram)
[11:51:46] <phw> I have no problem with writing the questions / cumulating thing with plain javascript + html. But I though there should be a more comfortable solution - plus a possibility for rending the solution as a graph
[11:55:16] <decx> d3.js
[12:12:35] <wumbie> If I am using jQuery to AJAX a PHP page which is a directory above the web server root, how do I do that?
[12:13:16] <wumbie> my PHP code seems to be able to execute above the web server root but not once the page has been served
[12:13:35] <mightyiam> Hi! Is there something like .parents(), but that also returns the current set? Is there any way that I could get the current set plus .parents(), please?
[12:14:23] <wumbie> parents().children() ?
[12:14:46] <wumbie> there's probably a better way though
[12:17:18] <bowenac> anyone good with ajax? I am trying to retrive all results from mysql table for a user. I get am echoing the json results and I can see them in the firefox console
[12:17:37] <bowenac> But having some trouble displaying the results in the success of the ajax
[12:20:11] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/5zwwBFVK if anyone would like to take a look
[12:23:02] <shoky> bowenac: your success callback's data argument is called json, not data
[12:24:44] <shoky> bowenac: also it's dataType, not datatype
[12:25:13] <bowenac> thanks for that
[12:26:06] <bowenac> so now I changed it to http://pastebin.com/VaHtbEbs
[12:26:11] <bowenac> I get object object
[12:26:16] <bowenac> but only one row
[12:26:36] <bowenac> getting closer lol
[12:27:23] <shoky> umm
[12:27:36] <shoky> you're changing the whole inner html on each iteration of the for loop
[12:27:45] <shoky> maybe you want .append instead of .html
[12:28:06] <shoky> or actually, donno what you're trying to do there ;p
[12:28:27] <bowenac> yea that gets each row
[12:28:27] <shoky> encoding the db results straight to json doesn't sound smart
[12:28:36] <bowenac> so how do I fix the object object
[12:28:43] <bowenac> ->column
[12:28:51] <shoky> what does your json look like..
[12:29:04] <shoky> the php's output
[12:29:20] <bowenac> [{"id":"1","employee":"2","date":"2014-04-19 16:22:20",
[12:29:23] <bowenac> kind of like that
[12:29:27] <shoky> ok
[12:29:53] <shoky> ok so you're printing out "id"
[12:29:56] <shoky> instead of item.id
[12:30:13] <shoky> same for employee, company
[12:31:59] <bowenac> item.employee item.company?
[12:32:03] <bowenac> get undefined
[12:32:46] <shoky> inside the loop?
[12:32:59] <bowenac> $('#output').append("<p>Lead ID: </p>"+item.id+"<p> Employee Name: </p>"+item.employee+"<p>Company Name:</p>"+item.company);
[12:34:06] <bowenac> nm
[12:34:11] <bowenac> wrong array lol
[12:34:14] <bowenac> thanks that works
[13:19:59] <oniMaker> Is there any way to feed a template into jQuery ui datepicker?
[13:20:34] <oniMaker> or, is there a way to insert html into each date box of the popup calendar?
[13:20:41] <oniMaker> I know there are before/after display functions that run
[13:21:08] <oniMaker> but the html for a day looks like: <td class=" " data-handler="selectDay" data-event="click" data-month="3" data-year="2014"><a class="ui-state-default" href="#">30</a></td>
[13:21:21] <oniMaker> So how can I select by day based on that?
[13:21:51] <oniMaker> I could loop through each and check the content of the <a> element... but that's sort of gross
[13:35:05] <skullcrasher> how do i "rebind" a click handler?
[13:35:19] <skullcrasher> it is that i have an ajax request with html response
[13:35:40] <skullcrasher> the response is added to an html element, but then the defined clickhandler won't work on this new added element
[13:35:53] <skullcrasher> so is there something like a "rebint"
[13:35:55] <skullcrasher> ?
[13:37:57] <skullcrasher> ok, got it :)
[13:38:07] <skullcrasher> .on delegate events
[14:00:18] <cek> guys how do I get JSON parsed object in ajax:error handler?
[14:00:37] <cek> for ajax:success , it's autoconverted and fed in "data" param
[14:05:23] <shoky> cek: function(xhr) { var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText); ... }
[14:05:45] <cek> yea im aware of that. i also see reponseJSON object in xhr
[14:06:31] <jameswlane> Is there a way to target two items I am doing a mouse over and I want it to fire on the <dt> and <dd>
[14:07:04] <shoky> cek: that's not a standard xhr property afaik
[14:07:21] <cek> ok, so no auto parse json in ajax error
[14:07:25] <shoky> nope
[14:07:45] <cek> fine. i'm leaving then!
[14:07:49] <shoky> seeya
[14:19:04] <TechnologyEnthus> jQuery detecting number range inaccurately, help please? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23150130/
[14:22:07] <TechnologyEnthus> client crashed, please repeat any messages after my question if any
[14:50:31] <pndrunk> is there a blink effect in the jquery libary?
[14:52:41] <pndrunk> $("myDiv").animate({left:'300px'});  <-- I can only get that to work if myDiv has a 'position:absolute' in the css
[14:53:02] <pndrunk> does that seem correct?
[14:53:48] <decx> an element needs position relative/absolute/fixed or else left will do nothing so it makes sense
[14:54:05] <TechnologyEnthus> $("myDiv").animate({'left':'300px'});
[14:54:16] <shoky> $("myDiv") is for <myDiv>s
[14:54:31] <pndrunk> i guess. seems like it would move left, 300 pixels from where it is currently located
[14:54:55] <shoky> only if you don't know css
[14:55:11] <pndrunk> yea well, guess who doesn't know css?
[14:55:18] <shoky> use position:relative for that
[14:55:23] <decx> depending on which browser you want to target, you can css() translate instead
[14:55:35] <decx> transform
[14:55:37] <pndrunk> all browsers, usually
[14:55:41] <kevingeek> shit you guys are smart :P
[14:55:56] <shoky> position:relative and animate left is what you want
[14:56:01] <TechnologyEnthus> $("myDiv").animate({left:'300px','position':'relative'});
[14:56:05] <shoky> no..
[14:56:16] <shoky> don't animate position ;P
[14:56:32] <pndrunk> what's the correct way shoky ?
[14:56:39] <decx> don't animate() ^^
[14:56:49] <shoky> set position:relative in the css. or if you wanna do it from js, do it with .addClass
[14:56:51] <pndrunk> mostly, I just want to <blink>
[14:56:58] <shoky> then animate left like you did
[14:57:02] <shoky> uh
[14:57:06] <pndrunk> lol
[14:57:12] <shoky> animating left doesn't sound like it'd blink
[14:57:14] <pndrunk> that was a joke
[14:57:21] <shoky> ok ;]
[14:57:31] <pndrunk> cause. beers. haha
[14:57:48] <TechnologyEnthus> $("myDiv") .animate({left:'300px','position':'relative'}) .css({'position':'','relative':''});
[14:57:59] <shoky> not really
[14:58:13] <pndrunk> so if using .addClass does the .addClass have the..
[14:58:16] <TechnologyEnthus> fuck i did it again
[14:58:30] <pndrunk> eh. fuck it. too many beers in to care rightnow
[14:58:38] <TechnologyEnthus> remove the position out of the animation
[14:58:52] <shoky> nah
[14:59:21] <shoky> you'd need it to have position:relative before the animation, also you have {'position':'','relative':''}
[14:59:22] <TechnologyEnthus> here is a real problem :( http://stackoverflow.com/q/23150130/
[14:59:57] <TechnologyEnthus> use:  http://jsfiddle.net/ if you want to test code live :)
[15:01:07] <decx> setinterval to catch all the new elements that get added when you click load more every 3,5 seconds really?
[15:01:23] <shoky> TechnologyEnthus: those 2 code snippets don't seem related at all, the first one is all wrong
[15:01:34] <pndrunk> oh, i do have a real question.. not sure if i'll be able to type it in any sense that make senst
[15:01:42] <TechnologyEnthus> hey, does "-webkit-filter: hue-rotate(200deg);" work in jquery -> firefox 28.0 ?
[15:01:51] <TechnologyEnthus> i know pure css it doesnt
[15:02:08] <TechnologyEnthus> or filter: hue-rotate(200deg);
[15:02:22] <shoky> wat
[15:02:34] <TechnologyEnthus> it works in chrome in changing things with color
[15:02:40] <TechnologyEnthus> if you just use css
[15:03:24] <decx> firefox doesn't have filter
[15:03:40] <decx> you have to juryrig an svg effect instead
[15:04:42] <pndrunk> if ($(".box1").val(bg)==('rgb(255,0,0')){ <-- how can i check the BG color of a div / compare it to a color?
[15:05:00] <pndrunk> bg in that case is a variable
[15:05:13] <pndrunk> var bg=$(".box1:odd").css("background-color");
[15:05:15] <TechnologyEnthus> im wondering if this would work in firefox instead of pure css which does not " $("myDiv") .css({'-webkit-filter':'rotate(200deg)'}); "
[15:05:53] <decx> you catch the rgb(a) split it and compare the hues
[15:06:11] <TechnologyEnthus> how would it be used in the form i used?
[15:06:53] <decx> why would firefox support the -webkit- prefix anyway?
[15:07:06] <TechnologyEnthus> i had just read it today
[15:07:26] <TechnologyEnthus> figured maybe jquery would have a work around
[15:07:43] <decx> also css sets up the right prefix automagically
[15:08:08] <TechnologyEnthus> not entirely sure how to change hue with jquery though
[15:09:50] <decx> you convert rgb to hsl
[15:10:00] <TechnologyEnthus> have a doc link?
[15:10:31] <decx> i'm sure there's something on stack when you search rgb hsl javascript
[15:11:10] <TechnologyEnthus> would pure css > background: hsl(205, 66%, 40%); work in firefox ?
[15:11:49] <decx> never saw it used but i guess it works
[15:15:38] <TechnologyEnthus> would #div {-moz-filter: hue-rotate(90deg);} work in firefox?
[15:16:57] <shoky> stop asking and try it yourself
[15:18:52] <pndrunk> i went away, now i'm back..
[15:19:08] <pndrunk> my google fu sucks
[15:20:32] <jkmcrg> Hello, is there any way to .off a custom function that is passed an event? I have to bind it with $(window).on(‘click’, function (e) { custom(e, params) }), but how do I .off that funciton literal?
[15:20:56] <jkmcrg> Because I can’t just do $(window).on(‘click’, custom(e, params)) from what I’ve tried.
[15:22:21] <decx> TechnologyEnthus i told you already, for firefox you have to use an svg effect because css hue-rotate is only in webkit
[15:28:21] <TechnologyEnthus> http://cssdesk.com/r7QmF doesnt work i guess :(
[15:28:23] <decx> TechnologyEnthus http://jsfiddle.net/decx/zzYqN/
[15:28:40] <TechnologyEnthus> :)
[15:29:46] <TechnologyEnthus> how would you write it if you just want to change hue with no matrix?
[15:31:23] <decx> i dont know what that means
[15:31:39] <TechnologyEnthus> http://jsfiddle.net/computerguy/zzYqN/1/ ?
[15:31:51] <TechnologyEnthus> i tried changing hue but its stuck
[15:31:57] <TechnologyEnthus> or i broked it
[15:32:35] <TechnologyEnthus> i want to add this to my userstyles or jquery injector
[15:32:39] <decx> you changed the webkit filter
[15:32:51] <TechnologyEnthus> so i cant rely on the div having attributes
[15:33:10] <decx> the svg effect value is values="150"
[15:34:10] <TechnologyEnthus> how would you do it with out relying on div color matrix and only on the jquery + css or just jquery alone?
[15:35:40] <decx> just put your svg effect somewhere on your page then you css can assign it with url('selector')
[15:36:20] <TechnologyEnthus> $('.colorPickerWrapper').hslCircleColorPicker({ hsl : [ 240, 100, 50 ] });
[15:36:43] <yargy> Hey guys I am just wondering how I would simulate clicking on the House and Apartment icons on this page https://www.mynetfone.com.au/portal/buynow/DslQualification.action?
[15:36:52] <TechnologyEnthus> or is this better, $('.colorPickerWrapper').hslCircleColorPicker({ color : 'rgb(255,0,0)' });
[15:37:03] <yargy> I have tried using .trigger but it doesn’t seem to work
[15:37:51] <TechnologyEnthus> there is also this as well $('.colorPickerWrapper').hslCircleColorPicker({ h : 180, saturation:80 });
[15:41:32] <jkmcrg> jkmcrg: Hey, you should really just use event namespaces to make it super easy to remove even function literals!
[15:41:38] <jkmcrg> jkmcrg: sick thanks!
[15:43:12] <TechnologyEnthus> i found this decx, http://jsfiddle.net/computerguy/57E4K/10/
[15:47:14] <yargy> I have tried using this but it doesn’t seem to work :(     $('button:first').trigger('click');
[16:11:13] <yargy> it works if I use fadeOut with that same selector though
[16:11:21] <yargy> :(
[16:16:02] <hpekdemir> hi. I have a key named "error" in my ajax response data. but when I try to alert(data.error) I get nothing because I guess jquery's .error() function is being used
[16:16:07] <hpekdemir> how can I bypass jquery
[16:16:10] <hpekdemir> in this case?
[16:16:25] <TechnologyEnthus> in russia jquery bypasses you
[16:16:33] <TechnologyEnthus> :P
[16:16:51] <caleb_io> Where are you trying to do `alert(data.error)`?
[16:17:03] <hpekdemir> caleb_io: in 201: function() { ... }
[16:17:07] <hpekdemir> within ajax.
[16:17:20] <hpekdemir> I return a status code of 201 (for created)
[16:19:19] <hpekdemir> guys
[16:19:28] <hpekdemir> I just need a syntaxically bypassing "error"
[16:19:38] <TechnologyEnthus> would help if i knew :(
[16:19:38] <hpekdemir> data.error <- fires jquery's error
[16:19:44] <hpekdemir> this is basic javascript I guess.
[16:19:54] <hpekdemir> somehow data.$error or what.
[16:20:00] <hpekdemir> I'm just guessing.
[16:20:09] <hpekdemir> data.\error
[16:20:25] <caleb_io> I've never heard of anything in the response triggering an error callback other than the status code.
[16:21:53] <hpekdemir> caleb_io: I can define my own json objects from my API
[16:22:13] <hpekdemir> so the return is actually { error : { msg : "something went wrong." } }
[16:24:25] <shoky> hpekdemir if the error callback is being called, check the arguments passed to it. maybe your json is invalid (like the sample you just wrote)
[16:24:44] <hpekdemir> shoky: { error : { msg : "foo" } } is wrong?
[16:24:52] <shoky> it's not valid json
[16:25:08] <hpekdemir> shoky: what would be the valid version of it?
[16:25:19] <shoky> keys need to be in quotes
[16:26:01] <hpekdemir> well
[16:26:13] <hpekdemir> I didn't put them here in irc.
[16:26:38] <shoky> well, i said maybe
[16:27:38] <caleb_io> Can you paste us your actual AJAX call and handlers?
[16:27:42] <caleb_io> Instead of just the responses.
[16:38:57] <hpekdemir> nopaste: http://nopaste.info/c4c1fb3899.html
[16:41:13] <shoky> hpekdemir: don't use alerts for debugging, use console.log e.g.   console.log('success', data)     and check your console
[16:42:39] <hpekdemir> undefined
[16:42:44] <hpekdemir> in alert it also said undefined.
[16:43:03] <caleb_io> do console.log(arguments) inside of your success handler
[16:43:23] <hpekdemir> arguments?
[16:43:26] <hpekdemir> you mean data
[16:43:34] <caleb_io> no, just do: `console.log(arguments);`
[16:43:55] <hpekdemir> ok
[16:43:56] <shoky> hpekdemir: it logged "success" and undefined ?
[16:44:18] <hpekdemir> undefined
[16:44:19] <shoky> function(data) { console.log('success', data) }
[16:44:30] <hpekdemir> console.log(arguments) gives "undefined"
[16:44:38] <shoky> dont run that in your console
[16:44:42] <shoky> put it in the function
[16:45:03] <shoky> and it will log to the console if it reaches that point..
[16:45:05] <hpekdemir> and console.log('success', data) gives "undefined" too
[16:45:09] <shoky> dude
[16:45:15] <shoky> it gives it where?
[16:45:18] <shoky> when? what are you doing?
[16:45:21] <hpekdemir> in the console of firebug
[16:45:24] <shoky> what are you doing
[16:45:35] <shoky> dont paste that into your console
[16:45:46] <hpekdemir> shoky: I put console.log('success', data) on the line of nopaste where alert(data.error.msg) is
[16:45:54] <hpekdemir> no I'm writing it in my code.
[16:46:02] <shoky> and it doesn't log "success" to your console?
[16:46:03] <cronin> If i had setup an ajax prefilter for the url, is there a way to selectively ignore that prefilter?
[16:46:11] <shoky> then it never reaches that point, your success handler isn't being called
[16:46:13] <hpekdemir> no it doesn't
[16:46:18] <shoky> add an error handler
[16:47:00] <shoky> error: function(xhr,b,c){ console.log('error', b, c) }
[16:49:33] <hpekdemir> with that error handler I get in console: error error Bad Request
[16:49:57] <krambiorix> i have an autocomplete in a div. When the AC opens, my content is moved down... How can i prevent that?
[16:49:58] <shoky> check firebug's network tab, see what it has to say about the request
[16:50:02] <shoky> hpekdemir ^
[16:50:46] <hpekdemir> I don't have a "network" tab
[16:50:57] <hpekdemir> but I can see response, header, JSON, if you mean that?
[16:51:05] <hpekdemir> I can see the POST request
[16:51:25] <caleb_io> what is the status code from the POST request?
[16:51:28] <hpekdemir> 400
[16:51:30] <hpekdemir> bad request.
[16:51:33] <shoky> there you go
[16:51:46] <hpekdemir> so?
[16:51:47] <caleb_io> Then it's hitting your custom `statusCode` handler, correct?
[16:51:56] <shoky> 400 is error
[16:51:56] <hpekdemir> yes
[16:52:50] <caleb_io> Then what is the problem?  It's hitting your 400 statusCode handler correctly and you should be able to get the data inside of that.
[16:53:08] <caleb_io> If not, `console.log(arguments);` inside of the 400 error handler.
[16:53:30] <shoky> it should have the error handler's arguments
[16:53:40] <tectonic> caleb_io: do I know you?
[16:53:40] <hpekdemir> [Object { readyState=4, responseText="{\n "error" : {\n ... is not valid."\n }\n}\n", responseJSON={...}, more...}, "error", "Bad Request"]
[16:53:45] <hpekdemir> is the console.log(arguments)
[16:54:03] <hpekdemir> but I can't access the responseText with data.error.msg
[16:54:09] <hpekdemir> so I guess I have to access it differently
[16:54:19] <shoky> hpekdemir:  function(xhr, errorStr) { var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);  console.log('data.error.msg') }
[16:54:49] <hpekdemir> shoky: in the statuscode 400 area?
[16:54:51] <shoky> yeah
[16:55:02] <shoky> and obviously that last console.log should be without the quotes
[16:55:11] <caleb_io> tectonic: most likely if you like Nerf ;P
[16:55:18] <tectonic> hehe
[16:55:33] <hpekdemir> shoky: it logs "data.error.msg" in console
[16:55:36] <tectonic> ah Saturday afternoon IRC
[16:55:38] <hpekdemir> oh ok
[16:55:41] <hpekdemir> wait without quotes.
[16:56:00] <hpekdemir> IT WORKS.
[16:56:06] <hpekdemir> so what did we do here?
[16:56:11] <caleb_io> tectonic: ah Saturday afternoon wakeup from painkillers.
[16:56:20] <hpekdemir> console output with the above (without quotes ofc) is "Email is not valid."
[16:56:42] <shoky> hpekdemir: jquery only does automatic json parsing for you if it calls your success handler. not for error handlers
[16:56:48] <hpekdemir> hmm ok
[16:56:50] <caleb_io> hpekdemir: the first argument to your custom error handler is a jqXhr.  You need to parse it as JSON to convert it to a JavaScript object and then you can use the mesage from it.
[16:56:50] <shoky> so you have to do it manually
[16:57:01] <hpekdemir> good to know.
[16:57:06] <hpekdemir> big thanks guys. you really helped me.
[17:11:03] <HowardwLo> hi all
[17:11:13] <HowardwLo> Can anyone tell what type of color model this is? "colour_1":"75.5309016733,-14.789335121,1.94120401187,0.159742296919" really stumped. Googled through a bunch of color models but cant seem to find a match. Negative numbers, first 3 typicalyl dont go past 70-80, last digit is usually under 1
[17:12:34] <Delizin> Howdy all. I am bumbling around with jquery and can't seem to resolve my current issue. I am retrieving a json file with ajax and then I want to populate some specific form fields with the data I received, but as embarassing as it is I have no idea how to get the data out of the object I received. Here is my terribly written script: http://dpaste.com/1787424/
[17:12:43] <Delizin> HowardwLo: Do you know what color that represents?
[17:14:37] <HowardwLo> Delizin: i think its a teal/green?
[17:15:44] <happytux_> hi
[17:15:48] <happytux_> So I want a custom event system and I need one where the events can "bubble up" from children of a class to parent.
[17:15:50] <happytux_> To describe further: A parent "contains" a children by a reference in an array.
[17:15:51] <happytux_> Something like Flash does.
[17:18:44] <HowardwLo> 0,0,0,.27 is a black Delizin
[17:18:49] <HowardwLo> (i think..)
[17:20:25] <Delizin> HowardwLo: Hmm I am checking around to see if I can find anything. What is the source?
[17:20:56] <HowardwLo> its from some API i got, no idea where it came from
[17:21:23] <audran> happytux DOM events already bubble like Flash events do. Dom 3 includes a custom event API so you can create your own like you can in Flash. Is this not what you need?
[17:21:36] <HowardwLo> someone probably knows, but I sure as heck dont. just tasked with figuring out this
[17:26:21] <Delizin> HowardwLo: Maybe l*a*b* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space ?
[17:27:37] <HowardwLo> Delizin: LAB has 3 digits right?
[17:28:34] <TechnologyEnthus> rbga, red, blue, green, alpha(transparency)
[17:28:38] <TechnologyEnthus> 0,0,0,1
[17:29:42] <Delizin> HowardwLo: Hmm I guess so, that would rule that out then
[17:30:09] <HowardwLo> TechnologyEnthus: is there a rbga version that has negative values?
[17:33:51] <Delizin> Gonna throw this one out here again. I am retrieving a json file with ajax and then I want to populate some specific form fields with the data I received, but as embarassing as it is I have no idea how to get the data out of the object I received. Here is my script http://dpaste.com/1787424/
[17:35:15] <audran> Delizin what part is failing? Does done() not get called? Is msg undefined?
[17:36:36] <Delizin> audran: None of it fails, msg returns an object, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to access the values in it. There should be keys and values like this: "last_name":"Doe", "first_name":"Jane"
[17:37:01] <TechnologyEnthus> HowardwLo: what do you mean negitive values?
[17:37:05] <Delizin> But I've tried to them by doing things like msg.last_name or msg['last_name']
[17:37:18] <Delizin> I just don't know the correct syntax for javascript I guess
[17:37:28] <HowardwLo> TechnologyEnthus: "colour_1":"75.5309016733,-14.789335121,1.94120401187,0.159742296919"  2nd value is -14.789
[17:37:58] <TechnologyEnthus> might be a coordinate
[17:38:34] <TechnologyEnthus> could be a gradiant or something
[17:39:02] <audran> Oh :) So you can use two different styles, dot notation or array-like notation. Your response object probably has a data property which has the actual data you returned. You could access it it like "msg.data.last_name" or "msg.data['last_name']"
[17:39:24] <audran> You use the second style when the property name wouldn't be a valid variable name in Javascript
[17:39:24] <decx> i don't think the human eye can tell apart enough colours to justify even a tenth of all these digits :o
[17:40:02] <TechnologyEnthus> sometimes when I see color ranges that large I like to think of animation margins
[17:40:13] <Delizin> audran: Thank you, I will try that out
[17:40:21] <TechnologyEnthus> or positions to be specific
[17:42:21] <Delizin> audran: Unfortunately that wasn't it. Do you happen to know of a way to explore js objects, like in browser web console for example?
[17:43:03] <audran> Absolutely
[17:43:09] <audran> You have a few options
[17:43:18] <audran> console.log(msg) is probably the easiest
[17:43:26] <TechnologyEnthus> few extensions do that
[17:43:31] <audran> Open your browser's dev tools, reload and you should see the content
[17:43:38] <TechnologyEnthus> that addon the option to view jquery in console
[17:43:40] <TechnologyEnthus> or javascript
[17:43:52] <TechnologyEnthus> I think queryfire or something
[17:43:52] <audran> Don't need something jq specific for this
[17:43:54] <TechnologyEnthus> for firefox
[17:45:16] <Delizin> What I am using right now is web developer which is part of firebug I think
[17:45:49] <audran> You can also use your developer tools' network monitor to see the exact response coming back over the wire
[17:47:16] <Delizin> Good deal, I'll try exploring around this for a bit and maybe I can come up with something
[17:47:17] <Delizin> Thanks
[17:47:40] <audran> Just checked the docs, the first parameter to your handler should actually just be the raw data. Good luck.
[17:48:28] <HowardwLo> TechnologyEnthus: animation positions?
[17:48:35] <wa5ted> hey guys
[17:48:44] <wa5ted> Cork: bro you around
[17:49:00] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[17:49:02] <wa5ted> Velveeta: bro you around
[17:50:12] <wa5ted> my question is: i have have a dynamically added image (via jquery) , now when i go to do a click event the click doesnt work $("img").on("click", function()....  <- i have run into this issue before and i remember there being a solution any help?
[17:51:16] <decx> you can only attach that stuff to elements that are on your page at loadtime
[17:51:30] <decx> so you have to delegate your clickevent from a parent element that is there
[17:51:38] <wa5ted> decx: yes delgate
[17:51:44] <wa5ted> i remeber that what i have to do
[17:51:49] <decx> $('#parent').on('click','.newitems', function(){ })
[17:52:02] <wa5ted> okay thanks
[17:52:44] <wa5ted> Velveeta grafi Cork  your guys around
[17:52:55] <wa5ted> just popping in to say hi :)
[17:53:50] <wa5ted> decx: question what if the parent is also dymnaically generated?
[17:53:54] <wa5ted> would i o
[17:53:55] <wa5ted> do*
[17:54:01] <MrGate> can i get some help with this please https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8105c266fd8f6760c400
[17:54:17] <Fraz> hey
[17:54:23] <Fraz> is there a channel for jquery mobile?
[17:54:25] <decx> it doesnt have to be a direct parent, just attach it somewhere that exists wa5ted
[17:54:31] <wa5ted> $("body").on("click", "#parent>.newitems", function() {})
[17:54:43] <decx> for example
[17:54:50] <MrGate> me wa5ted ?
[17:54:56] <wa5ted> no no
[17:54:59] <wa5ted> that was for decx
[17:55:28] <MrGate> sorry
[17:55:46] <wa5ted> MrGate: try doing a console.log of data on complete
[17:55:48] <wa5ted> event
[17:55:51] <wa5ted> and see what you get
[17:56:44] <MrGate> how do i do that i know console.log(); is the format
[17:56:48] <MrGate> not sure what to put in there
[17:57:07] <MrGate> the data is getting in the database
[17:57:07] <wa5ted> well an ajax request that you have will have complete callback
[17:57:13] <wa5ted> like the success callback that you already have
[17:57:18] <wa5ted> just do a complete callback
[17:57:28] <wa5ted> and then insert inside a console.log(data)
[17:57:40] <wa5ted> make sure to include i nthe complete callback complete(data)
[17:58:15] <wa5ted> MrGate: why would you not use $.post directly?
[17:58:21] <wa5ted> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:58:27] <wa5ted> ^complete call back is in there
[18:00:33] <MrGate> ill look at $.post
[18:01:49] <wa5ted> decx: got the img thing working is there any way i can make a click even trigger if the area that is not the image is selected
[18:01:58] <wa5ted> kinda like when you click a modal to open
[18:02:07] <wa5ted> and if you click in the empty area it closes
[18:05:27] <Fraz> any jq mobile users around?
[18:05:33] <MrGate> wa5ted its not working
[18:05:52] <wa5ted> Fraz: there is a dedicated channel for jquery mobile
[18:06:01] <Fraz> #jquerymobile?
[18:06:04] <Fraz> not many people in there
[18:06:15] <Delizin> audran: Finally got it thanks to your guidance about the console.log command. It turns out msg was an array with an array of my json in it, so I had do msg[0].last_name, etc. to access it
[18:06:17] <wa5ted> #jquerymobile-dev
[18:06:22] <Delizin> Appreciate the help
[18:06:29] <wa5ted> Fraz: ^^
[18:06:30] <Fraz> ok thanks
[18:06:34] <Fraz> :)
[18:06:48] <wa5ted> MrGate: it a jsfiddle show me how you are doing your complete callback
[18:07:11] <MrGate> im not sure how to set it up there
[18:07:19] <MrGate> i can post gist or pastebin does that help
[18:07:36] <wa5ted> MrGate: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[18:07:41] <wa5ted> ^scroll down a bit
[18:07:44] <wa5ted> in $.post
[18:07:58] <wa5ted> there is a call back called always
[18:08:06] <wa5ted> and it shows you how to do it
[18:08:47] <decx> wa5ted you can use event target to tell what you clicked
[18:09:02] <MrGate> http://pastebin.com/eaDa05Av
[18:09:16] <wa5ted> decx: example?
[18:09:53] <wa5ted> MrGate: you didnt get anything back from that .done callback
[18:10:02] <MrGate> no :(
[18:10:18] <wa5ted> hmmm
[18:10:32] <wa5ted> have you tried with $.post (it should make a difference but just try if you havent)
[18:10:38] <decx> wa5ted $('#container').on('click',function(e){ if (!$(e.target).is('.mytarget')) { do stuff } })
[18:10:51] <wa5ted> decx thanks
[18:13:07] <MrGate> wa5ted: it wont work with post
[18:13:18] <MrGate> no data insets in to the database then
[18:15:48] <wa5ted> well try wiht $.post
[18:15:56] <wa5ted> i personally have found it easier
[18:17:04] <wa5ted> i wish i had some code handy to show you
[18:18:14] <wa5ted> MrGate: in your php are you doing if($_POST.....)
[18:18:16] <wa5ted> stuff
[18:18:24] <wa5ted> to check if the values that you are sending are valid
[18:19:59] <MrGate> i fixed it
[18:20:09] <MrGate> needed a return false at the end of the file
[18:20:21] <wa5ted> true
[18:20:23] <wa5ted> congrats :)
[18:20:53] <wa5ted> decx: how would i do that with a delegation like before
[18:20:59] <wa5ted> im doing a sort of modal with an image
[18:21:14] <wa5ted> and if the area around the image is selected it closes
[18:25:38] <wa5ted> nvm got it
[18:30:34] <wa5ted> decx: got a bug
[18:30:36] <wa5ted> http://rohan.bhangui.com/portfolio/veloria/
[18:31:01] <wa5ted> ^if you click on an image the modal shows but if you continue to scroll the modal gets cut off
[18:31:07] <wa5ted> anyway to solve this

[19:40:00] <freebirD2> you guys, I'm with an issue in my upload script, using jquery upload file, after a send the firts file, it opens a new div in the top, with another upload, than, after I send the second upload(in the top), the div vanishes, but if I send another file to upload , the top upload shows up again, how do I know it was already uploaded ? I've tryed sessions, but wont work, please: http://lifediagnosticos.com.br/app/webroot/uploads/
[19:41:00] <freebirD2> if I verify if the file is there, with img.width, wont work in the very first time, only the second, so doesn't work
[19:53:53] <andrewanderson> i've got an ajax callback from rails to change text of a button, using jquery. the text changes in the source code, but not on the actual screen. is there a jquery command to assert screen refresh?
[19:56:30] <tandroid> andrewanderson, are you sure you're looking at the right element? If it changes in the source code, there is no reason for it to not show up unless the element is hidden.
[19:58:04] <nahtnam> Hey guys! I downloaded a script. It uses this line. afterShow:"loadPending()" I cant find that in the msgBox documentation. Is that a jquery thing?
[19:58:16] <nahtnam> or a msgBox thing?
[19:58:20] <nahtnam> or a Javascript thing?
[19:59:24] <nahtnam> andrewanderson: I think I know what your issue is.
[19:59:38] <nahtnam> Did you get it solved?
[19:59:41] <andrewanderson> tandroid was right
[19:59:43] <andrewanderson> i'm an idiot
[20:00:00] <tandroid> andrewanderson, we've all done it :)
[20:00:00] <nahtnam> andrewanderson: Oh ok.
[20:00:17] <nahtnam> andrewanderson: For future reference, it might have to do with turbolinks so watch out for that
[20:00:31] <andrewanderson> disable turbolinks?
[20:00:41] <nahtnam> andrewanderson: Thats what I did for javascript
[20:00:59] <caleb_io> nahtnam: what exactly are you asking?  Are you wondering about `afterShow` or `loadPending`?
[20:01:02] <nahtnam> andrewanderson: <%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>
[20:01:12] <caleb_io> Also what is `msgBox`?
[20:01:14] <nahtnam> caleb_io: Yes.
[20:01:20] <nahtnam> caleb_io: It is a plugin
[20:01:59] <nahtnam> caleb_io: Is aftershow a function made by msgBox, jquery, or is it built in javascript?
[20:02:23] <caleb_io> It's most likely by msgBox.
[20:02:34] <caleb_io> But I can't tell you for sure unless I know which msgBox plugin you're using.
[20:02:36] <nahtnam> caleb_io: The problem is that i cant find it anywhere in the docs!
[20:02:42] <caleb_io> Look at the source code.
[20:02:49] <caleb_io> See if you see a mention of `afterShow`
[20:04:12] <caleb_io> If it's this (https://github.com/dotCtor/jQuery.msgBox) then it's implemented by them.
[20:05:13] <andrewanderson> is this type of syntax legal in jquery? $('#<%=j @video_id %>').text('Favorite').attr('class', 'tiny button')
[20:05:25] <andrewanderson> the jquery part obviously
[20:05:31] <freebirD2> var txt = $('#box2').text();  how do I get the strlen inside this div please ? .width does not work, please
[20:05:39] <freebirD2> width of chars
[20:05:56] <andrewanderson> freebirD2: strlen(txt)?
[20:06:06] <nahtnam> caleb_io: yea, its that one. :( Is there something similar that I can use for http://bootboxjs.com/
[20:06:10] <caleb_io> andrewanderson: the selector portion or the method chaining (.text().attr())?
[20:06:19] <andrewanderson> k
[20:06:27] <andrewanderson> oh freebirD2 it looks like txt.length()
[20:06:43] <andrewanderson> $('#<%=j @video_id %>').(text('Favorite').attr('class', 'tiny button')); more like this casleb?
[20:06:46] <andrewanderson> er
[20:06:48] <andrewanderson> chaining
[20:06:48] <nahtnam> caleb_io: NVm. Found it
[20:07:03] <andrewanderson> not even sure, i want to change both text and the attr
[20:07:31] <caleb_io> without the parenthesis before text it should work
[20:07:41] <caleb_io> $('#selector').text('Foo').attr('class', 'tiny button')
[20:07:51] <caleb_io> however you may want to do:  .addClass('tiny button') instead
[20:08:01] <freebirD2> 	var txt = $('#box2').text();	    alert(txt.length());
[20:08:08] <freebirD2> does not work, stops the script
[20:08:21] <freebirD2> alert(txt) show the text ok
[20:08:26] <caleb_io> it's just .length
[20:08:32] <caleb_io> .length is a property on a string not a method.
[20:08:59] <andrewanderson> should've popped up easily with javascript length tbh :s
[20:09:15] <caleb_io> alert(text.length)
[20:09:27] <caleb_io> txt*
[20:10:13] <freebirD2> great, tks a lot
[20:10:18] <freebirD2> finally
[20:24:08] <freebirD2> you guys, almost there, how do I make this image to show up please ? some " ' " in the end is causing the error,    tpl.find('p').text(data.files[0].name).append('<i>' + formatFileSize(data.files[0].size) + '</i><img src="uploads/images/' +data.files[0].name+ ' alt="Smiley face" height="42" width="42">');
[20:24:22] <nahtnam> YAYAYA I got it working :)
[20:55:06] <freebirD2> Im inserting a div using append, from a js file, with a <a href="#" id="olink>Close</a>, and inserted the hide code in the same script.js, like this: $( "a#olink" ).click(function() { $( "#imageBox" ).hide( "slow" );});    but doesn't work at all, the div wont close, any ideas ?
[20:55:21] <fattest> Does anyone have any idea why my nana scroller isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/4y7pz/ docs https://github.com/jamesflorentino/nanoScrollerJS
[21:06:06] <fattest> nevermind gents, i fixed it
[21:12:00] <Velveeta> holy crap, i got my browser down to 2 tabs.. gmail and facebook.. highfives all around!
[21:13:19] <Velveeta> freebird2: i'd have to see a snippet of your js to be able to tell you why that wasn't working.. the actual js, how it was implemented, not just the description
[21:13:29] <Velveeta> fattest: glad to hear you got that sorted
[21:13:42] <freebirD2> I did it man, tks a lot
[21:14:03] <freebirD2> had to include the a in the file, not from js
[21:14:50] <Velveeta> ok, good job :)
[21:15:01] <Velveeta> you know what i realized tonight?
[21:15:34] <Velveeta> $(this).addClass('bacardi-151').is(':drunk-even-faster') === true;
[21:20:54] <delizin> Hey all. Is there a way to change style="display:" between none and block? I've tried $("#id").css("display", "block"); $("#id").css("display", "none");, but it doesn't seem to work.
[21:22:34] <Velveeta> delizin: that should work fine, can we see an example snippet?
[21:23:25] <Velveeta> also, just to throw this out there, rather than modifying inline styles, you should be assigning that to a css class and add/remove'ingClass on that element for best practice, like $('#id').addClass('hidden'); $('#id').removeClass('hidden');
[21:23:47] <delizin> http://dpaste.com/1787664/
[21:26:01] <delizin> This is my first app working with jquery/js so it is a bit clunky
[21:34:55] <chriys> Velveeta: what about the toggle() function? http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[21:36:40] <Velveeta> chriys: toggle() works fine also, but is much faster if you can supply a 2nd parameter to tell it the state of your class
[21:36:51] <chriys> delizin: I don't understand the event which trigger your event
[21:36:58] <chriys> function*
[21:37:01] <Velveeta> delizin: sorry, i just saw your response, and am digging into it now
[21:37:17] <delizin> chriys: It is changing the selection on a combo box
[21:37:45] <chriys> Ok but what the user has to do to have this function to be executed
[21:38:00] <delizin> They make a selection from the combo box.
[21:38:18] <delizin> As soon as the element changes it fires the event.
[21:39:37] <Velveeta> so just for your own edification, to help slim some of that code down, you could collapse that whole chunck of if/elses down into something like this: $('[class^="column"]:eq(' + (number-1) + ')').css('display', 'block'); $(':not([class^="column"]:eq(' + (number-1) + '))').css('display', 'none');
[21:40:17] <Velveeta> assuming your .column1/2/3/etc classes are all in order in the dom
[21:41:20] <delizin> Velveeta: They are in order. That looks a little intimidating to me at the moment though. I am trying to change to add/removing a hide/show class instead of using the inline styles like you suggested.
[21:41:55] <Velveeta> so in that case, you would just define a css class for something like ".hide { display: none; }"
[21:42:22] <Velveeta> and then swap all references to .css('display', 'none') to .addClass('hide');
[21:42:32] <Velveeta> and the reverse for the others, use .removeClass('hide');
[21:43:50] <delizin> Sounds good, thanks for the assistance. I'll let you know how it turns out in a minute
[21:44:30] <Velveeta> sounds good
[21:48:18] <delizin> That worked out much better. Appreciate it greatly.
[21:52:58] <Velveeta> awesome :)
[22:27:10] <pnj> whos drunk?
[22:42:53] <hpekdemir> hi, I have the problem that my jquery function (on 'change') of an input does not work as soon as I remove all children from a div and make the content with "html('<div>..whatever</div>')"
[22:43:18] <hpekdemir> and in this "with html() created content" is the input field I want the change handler listen on.
[22:43:47] <hpekdemir> the content is the same. "on change" only triggers when I don't create the content via jquery's html()
[22:45:06] <hpekdemir> example: I have a div id=foo with an input field id=bar in it. I say $('input[id="bar"]').change(function() { ... } and it works when I write something in this input and click away.
[22:45:54] <hpekdemir> but now imagine I say "$('#foo').children('div').remove() and a "$('#foo').html('<div><input id="bar"...')
[22:46:02] <hpekdemir> now the "change" handler does not trigger.
[22:58:42] <Velveeta> pnj: that would be me
[22:59:57] <Velveeta> hpekdemir: if you're recreating the input you're binding an event listener (change) to, you're destroying the change handler that's bound, at the time that you're recreating the children
[23:00:38] <Velveeta> you need to look into event delegation if you want to do that sort of thing, you delegate a listener to a higher level container to listen on behalf of an element *called* #bar, as opposed to listening to #bar directly
[23:10:20] <hpekdemir> Velveeta: yes I solved the problem by saying ('#divname').on('change', '#divid', function() { ... }
[23:10:23] <hpekdemir> it works.
[23:10:43] <Velveeta> perfect :)
[23:17:48] <Jadenn> hello, i'm having some issues with javascript variables. i'm GETting a url with ajax, however it adds some cruft to the end of the url, specifically &_xxxxxxxx where x is a number
[23:18:22] <Jadenn> i've verified the variable in question and it seems clean, but whenever i go to GET that variable it adds said cruft
