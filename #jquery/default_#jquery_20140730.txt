[00:09:02] <Unopoo> found it, thx guys
[01:56:11] <srji> https://gist.github.com/visualisierte/0516dc2d056344a4410a i can't figure out how to use the .addClass from jquery-ui/effect
[01:56:14] <jop008> anyone using ckeditor? for edit free html text?
[01:56:59] <Unopoo> I have a <b> which contain three <input type="checkbox">, how to select the first input and set its checked = checeked and set <b> to hidden?
[02:02:09] <phoenixsun> is there an elegant way and checking the values of variable in javascript executed in the broswer?
[02:05:35] <davidyezsetz> console.log() ?
[02:06:33] <phoenixsun> ok I will look into that
[02:06:36] <phoenixsun> thanks
[02:11:39] <davidyezsetz> you need to pass the variable to it
[02:11:55] <davidyezsetz> and then open the dev-tools console to see it
[02:15:37] <blacklight> hi, is there any jquery.ui.autocomplete expert here? i'm trying to debug the code without success for having a feature like the following: in any moment, i'd like to know if an element in the autocomplete box is selected, possibly which one...is there any event triggered when the currently selected element changes?
[02:23:33] <DarsVaeda> in "$.post(xxx, { xxx: xxx });" what is the object in this case called syntactically?
[02:52:14] <Radditz> http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/
[02:52:23] <Radditz> why does this say 1? It's supposed to be 0
[02:52:24] <Radditz> I don't have anything as selected
[02:52:30] <Radditz> I want to find only if it is selected in the actual html
[02:55:39] <davidyezsetz> because the first option is selected by default
[02:55:49] <Uhkis> Radditz: because that jquery object's length is not 0
[02:56:03] <Radditz> how can I find out if it was set as selected="selected" in the actual html?
[02:56:14] <Radditz> not at runtime?
[02:56:57] <Uhkis> .attr('selected') ?
[02:57:03] <davidyezsetz> yup
[02:57:21] <Radditz> inside find?
[02:57:46] <Radditz> it gives me 8 if I do that
[03:02:33] <Radditz> hello, why does this give me 8
[03:02:37] <Radditz> http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/1/
[03:02:41] <Radditz> when there is only one selected option
[03:03:13] <LaBiblioteca> how do I find and remove an element from an xml string with jquery?
[03:03:21] <Woet> Radditz: http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/2/
[03:03:52] <systemfault> Radditz: 8 is the length of the value of the selected attribute… which is “selected”
[03:03:53] <Radditz> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/2/ still says 1
[03:04:00] <Woet> err, yea
[03:04:04] <Woet> because one of the option is selected
[03:04:05] <davidyezsetz> because $('#form').find('option').attr('selected') returns “selected"
[03:04:10] <Radditz> systemfault: how can I find how many selected values are there ?
[03:04:14] <Radditz> oh
[03:04:16] <Woet> Radditz: I gave you the link..
[03:04:19] <Radditz> and if there is none? what does it return
[03:04:20] <systemfault> Radditz: Woet told you
[03:04:23] <davidyezsetz> Radditz what are you trying to achieve?
[03:04:27] <Radditz> Woet: yours returns 1 even if nothing is selected
[03:04:41] <Woet> how can select nothing in your dropdown?
[03:04:43] <Radditz> if no value is selected="selected" I will set selectedIndex to -1
[03:04:50] <Radditz> because I get the selected value from a database
[03:04:54] <Radditz> and set the corresponding index
[03:04:57] <Radditz> when generating the html
[03:05:06] <Woet> why don't you just add selected="selected" in the HTML?
[03:05:13] <Radditz> I do that
[03:05:21] <Radditz> I said, the problem is if nothing is selected
[03:05:23] <Woet> so, as davidyezsetz asked, what are you trying to do?
[03:05:28] <LaBiblioteca> got the following xml "<something>123</something><something>abc</something>" , so I tried $($(xml).find("something")[0]).remove()
[03:05:29] <Radditz> I can't in html say go to -1
[03:05:33] <Radditz> I need to do it in javascript
[03:05:36] <LaBiblioteca> but it had no effect. the xml remains intact
[03:06:06] <Woet> LaBiblioteca: .remove removes elements from the DOM
[03:06:10] <LaBiblioteca> do I have to do a splice?
[03:06:13] <Woet> is that what you are doing?
[03:06:39] <LaBiblioteca> Woet: nah, I just have some xml in a variable . not using the DOM at all
[03:06:47] <Woet> okay, so .remove is pointless
[03:07:26] <davidyezsetz> Radditz so you just need to know wether the selected value is present?
[03:07:26] <LaBiblioteca> Woet: is there any function to remove elements from an xml variable?
[03:07:34] <Woet> Radditz: as davidyezsetz asked, what are you trying to do?
[03:07:36] <Radditz> davidyezsetz: yes
[03:07:39] <Radditz> Woet: I told you
[03:07:42] <ethan1341> http://jsfiddle.net/NmMRL/2/   I was under the impression if i clicked the div class show it would display the css display of streambox
[03:07:49] <Woet> you didn't
[03:07:50] <Radditz> I need to find if it was set up in the actual html, statically
[03:08:01] <Woet> until just now
[03:08:15] <Radditz> Woet: I set selected="selected" when generating the page, at runtime if none was set, I need to do  set SelectedIndex to -1 to set it to blank
[03:08:34] <LaBiblioteca> Woet: ..or do I actually have to convert the xml string into an object structure, remove stuff from that object structure, and then convert it back to an xml string again
[03:08:55] <Woet> Radditz: I usually just have an empty option in my dropdowns
[03:09:01] <LaBiblioteca> I fiend it weid that it's so easy to find info on how to use 'find' on xml strings...but not on how to remove stuff
[03:09:18] <LaBiblioteca> if you can find something you should be able to remove it as well, right?
[03:09:19] <Radditz> Woet: and if the user selects the empty option? I don't want them to be able to select an empty option, it's not aesthetically pretty
[03:10:49] <davidyezsetz> typeof $('#form').find('option').attr('selected') !== "undefined"
[03:10:54] <davidyezsetz> sorry
[03:11:02] <davidyezsetz> radditz http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/4/
[03:11:02] <Radditz> that only works for the first one only
[03:11:15] <Woet> Radditz: http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/5/
[03:11:52] <Radditz> that is cool Woet
[03:11:53] <Radditz> I might do that
[03:12:02] <Radditz> davidyezsetz: your stuff doesn't work if you put selected in the second option
[03:12:22] <Woet> Radditz: also, http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/ has placeholders
[03:12:30] <Woet> it also turns your dropdown into something decent
[03:12:34] <Woet> with a search
[03:12:35] <Radditz> can;t use that
[03:12:46] <Woet> why?
[03:12:58] <Radditz> everytghing is already made, this is a bug fix
[03:13:03] <Radditz> can't change UI during this period
[03:13:12] <Woet> alright then
[03:15:16] <cdoeberl> i created a sortable $("#foo").sortable(); which is a table holding multiple tr. but on drag the tr collapses and looks totally rubbish. how can i prevent it from collapsing?
[03:16:44] <phoenixsun> when creating a new youtube player object it seems to not allow the creation of a 'onStateChange' event. Is there something I am doing wrong?
[03:27:07] <davidyezsetz> Radditz try this http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/6/
[03:27:27] <Radditz> davidyezsetz: can't it be made in one line?
[03:32:17] <Woet> Radditz: you have some weird arbitrary limits
[03:32:21] <davidyezsetz> why does it need to be one lien=?
[03:32:27] <Woet> first you're not allowed to make something better because "its a bug fix"
[03:32:31] <Woet> now you're limited to 1 line of code too?
[03:33:05] <Radditz> I am going to just use the disabled stuff instead
[03:33:18] <Radditz> I don't have to make it one line, I just like it better if it's one line
[03:33:20] <Radditz> it's cuter that way
[03:33:30] <Woet> right
[03:33:33] <Woet> then use a minifier on your code
[03:33:36] <Woet> turn everything into 1 line
[03:34:28] <Radditz> I mean a real one line
[03:35:28] <Woet> right
[03:35:34] <Woet> well good luck with all your arbitrary limits
[03:35:45] <Woet> i don't envy you
[03:36:06] <Radditz> k
[03:36:34] <Radditz> ok apparently I can'rt disabnle an options
[03:36:43] <Radditz> Woet: show me again please how you disabled it
[03:41:53] <davidyezsetz> Radditz here you have it. A lot cuter as far as I can tell: http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/7/
[03:42:11] <Radditz> thank you
[03:42:16] <Woet> you can remove a bit more whitespace
[03:42:22] <Woet> [12:11:15]  <Woet>	 Radditz: http://jsfiddle.net/spG48/5/

[03:44:19] <Woet> phoenixsun: how is it related to jquery exactly?
[03:46:10] <phoenixsun> Woet: I thought I might be making some fundamental javascript error
[03:47:00] <Uhkis> phoenixsun: that's what ##javascript is for
[03:51:28] <ChoboBill> Hi, looking for advice from front-end developers here. I'm looking to become a web designer and have heard having coding expertise is important; I do have some internship expierence as a front-end developer. Starting of in my career what are the main areas to concentrate on? Should I go through agency or freelancing route?

[04:12:26] <Eppiox> Howdy, trying to pass in a varible to find stuff, however I don't think i'm dong it right. the 'data' in this case is a string variable, currently set to 'test to find me', works with the direct string, does not with the "+data+", any ideas? $(this).find("div:contains('"+data+"')").each(function() {...
[04:16:26] <Oreolek> hi. can anyone help me with duplicating an input on button click? http://jsfiddle.net/A7jxm/
[04:21:49] <suy> So, I can do   $.when( $.ajax("one"), $.ajax("two") )   but I can't see how to do it if I don't have hardcoded calls, but instead a number of calls coming from an array. I tried something like this: http://pastie.org/9431446  But I only get the first.
[04:23:09] <suy> Seems like I probably need an additional library for gathering the promises? Posts like  http://domenic.me/2012/10/14/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/  claim jQuery has some limitations, but I'm not sure this is one of them.
[04:24:51] <shoky> suy:  promises.push( ... );   not promises.push = ...
[04:25:20] <shoky> suy: and:  $.when.apply($, promises).done...
[04:26:19] <suy> shoky: OMG, you are right. Thank you! Trying it now.
[04:26:50] <buer_> hello i have following jquery code
[04:29:15] <buer_> i have following javascript code http://pastebin.com/rhsnVNUQ , it finds if ($('select[name="bankrupt_company"]').legnth > 0)  on line 11 but chrome gives error Unknown identifier line 17 on $('select[name="bankrupt_company"]').change()
[04:31:33] <shoky> buer_: you didn't close the .change(  from line 12
[04:32:18] <shoky> buer_: er also you have .legnth  on line 11
[04:32:59] <shoky> buer_: and 19 too
[04:33:48] <shoky> (it's .length)
[04:34:36] <Eppiox> Any ideas why $(this).find("div:contains('"+data+"')").each(function() {   < does not work for +data+ ?
[04:35:58] <buer_> i´ve fixed those errors but now it gives me unxepected end of input on line 1
[04:36:51] <shoky> buer_ you also didn't close the $(document).ready(
[04:38:20] <RizziCR> Eppiox: find(„div:contains(‚„+data+“)‘)
[04:38:51] <RizziCR> u have a syntax error in +"')")
[04:39:26] <RizziCR> + „ ) ‚ )  not + „ ‚ ) „ )
[04:39:45] <RizziCR> no.. mom :D
[04:39:57] <shoky> o_O
[04:40:21] <RizziCR> your right.. bad eyes ;)
[04:40:57] <Woet> richardwh1uk: please stop
[04:41:02] <Woet> sorry
[04:41:06] <Woet> he quit
[04:41:07] <Woet> nvm that
[04:54:47] <shoky> Eppiox: probably data isn't a simple string, something in it needs to be escaped, or it just doesn't match. using :contains for serious text search probably isn't a great idea. anyways make a jsfiddle
[04:55:49] <Eppiox> hmmm ok will do.
[05:32:37] <Senthil_> Hi experts. I have something like this

[05:32:51] <Senthil_> I want to popup when the div 40 is selected
[05:32:53] <Senthil_> how can i do that
[05:33:06] <Senthil_> can someone help me please
[05:33:51] <decx> are you making a southpark site or what?
[05:34:22] <Senthil_> myDivObj = document.getElementById("div.cigsperday"); if ( myDivObj ) {    alert ( myDivObj.innerHTML );  }else{    alert ( "Alien Found" ); }
[05:34:32] <Senthil_> nope. i want to display popu pwhen number 40 is selected
[05:35:03] <Senthil_> decx: no..just trying to show something with jquery
[05:35:53] <decx> what is the id #div.cigsperday
[05:36:09] <decx> because otherwise getElementById does nothing
[05:36:13] <Senthil_> [ <div class=​"cigsperday">​40​</div>​ ]
[05:36:16] <palzie> hey. how can I make so only the image corresponding to the header changes ? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/HIkxA
[05:36:17] <Senthil_> it retuns this
[05:36:27] <decx> it shouldnt
[05:36:56] <Senthil_> if the value of div is 40, then i should be alerted..can we do it?
[05:37:11] <decx> $('div.ck')
[05:37:47] <decx> $('div.cigsperday').click(function(){ if($(this).text() === '40'){ do stuff } })
[05:41:39] <FernandoBasso> How to store the html of the clicked element so that it can be inserted somewhere else?
[05:42:09] <FernandoBasso> I mean, if I just store var elem = $('#id'); can I do otherElem.append(elem) ?
[05:42:31] <decx> palzie http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yrine
[05:42:51] <Senthil_> decx thanks..
[05:43:00] <Senthil_> but it doesn't get me any popups
[05:43:00] <Senthil_> $('div.cigsperday').click(function(){ if($(this).text() === '40'){ alert ( "Alien Found" ); } }) 2014-07-30 14:42:30.158[ <div class=​"cigsperday">​26​</div>​ ]
[05:43:21] <decx> make a fiddle then
[05:43:28] <decx> these hypotheticals are the worst
[05:44:09] <palzie> decx: tx decx
[05:51:36] <palzie> decx: btw is there a way to animate the thing with easing ? cause i just get that you add/remove the class that makes trigger
[05:54:24] <decx> palzie http://codepen.io/anon/pen/syLrw
[05:55:08] <jamesbrown> hi guys i can't seem to find info about what bootstrap-tagsinput.min.js.map does
[05:55:31] <palzie> decx: hmm thanks. thought it could be done with adding parameters to toggleClass tho
[05:56:00] <decx> why offload visuals onto js if a class with transition can do it in css says i
[05:57:57] <decx> jamesbrown with a .js.map file you can get back to the original state from a minified file iirc
[05:59:38] <jamesbrown> decx the reason i ask is one fo the bootstrap i am using requires this
[06:17:31] <str8uplinux> if i call submit such as $('#myform').submit(); and want to pass parameters through submit() such as $('#myform').submit(myparam); and check for that in $('#myform').submit(function(){ if myparam =='somevalue' }); How would i go about that?
[06:45:01] <workerbe1two> Hi. I wanted to pass   $("#id") to a function changeIt(obj){ console.log(  $(obj).val() ) } receiving that object. like this:  changeIt( $("#id")  )  but the value is undefined $("#id") clearly worked one level above. whats wrong here?
[06:50:18] <srji> https://gist.github.com/visualisierte/0516dc2d056344a4410a
[06:54:56] <BillCriswell> workerbe1two: Is changeIt a callback to some event?
[06:56:59] <workerbe1two> indirectly yes.  onChange= fct1(){ changeIt() }
[06:57:31] <BillCriswell> workerbe1two: Why the fct1 ?
[06:58:44] <workerbe1two> BillCriswell: there is a lot to do. more a complex task
[07:00:39] <BillCriswell> workerbe1two: Are you using jQuery or inline scripts?
[07:00:58] <workerbe1two> BillCriswell: mix of javascript and jquery
[07:01:48] <BillCriswell> I'm sorry. Are you using event listeners or inline scripts.
[07:01:54] <workerbe1two> BillCriswell: providing an id does not work either. hmm. changeIT should find the object by its id.
[07:02:19] <BillCriswell> workerbe1two: http://jsbin.com/sudoteva/1/edit?html,js,output let me know if this helps clear up anything.
[07:05:56] <Es0teric> anyone here used jeditable?
[07:06:16] <Getty> huehue jedi table.... huehue
[07:06:28] <Es0teric> Getty: ha i just noticed that
[07:06:48] <BillCriswell> workerbe1two: http://jsbin.com/sudoteva/3/edit?html,js,output here it is calling another function inside of the event.
[07:06:57] <Getty> es0teric: i was actually first reading that, and then had to check channelname to get the context ;)
[07:07:19] <Es0teric> lol, Getty
[07:07:19] <BillCriswell> Getty: It's amazing what context can do.
[07:07:23] <Es0teric> but have you used it before?
[07:07:35] <BillCriswell> I immediately thought jEditable
[07:07:38] <Getty> lol i didnt used it, no
[07:07:43] <Getty> i know it exists
[07:08:05] <Getty> but i am not often getting the chance todo JS ;) even tho its my personal favorite fun (not best language, but its fun todo)
[07:08:31] <Getty> today i put electronics in the cloud, there is v8 in it ;) but not much haha
[07:10:55] <BillCriswell> Just typed up a question in stackoverflow and right before I hit enter I figure it out. :-/
[07:11:11] <Getty> BillCriswell!!!! The Duck Effect
[07:11:51] <Getty> BillCriswell: get a puppet, like a rubberduck or something else, and try to explain to it like you explain it to some random person of the job area, and suddenly most problem solve out
[07:12:20] <Getty> the same effect you get when you write the answer for the internet, its literally the same ;)
[07:12:48] <BillCriswell> I am familiar with the term. It wasn't working originally... but it may have been because I was tired last night.
[07:12:59] <BillCriswell> Sleep also helps... a whole lot.
[07:13:20] <Getty> TOTALLY ;) sleep is essential.... sleep cycle isnt, tho ;)
[07:20:52] <workerbe1two> BillCriswell: the code I work on is <input onChange="myfctWhichCallsChangeIt()" >
[07:22:53] <DevAntoine> hi
[07:23:17] <DevAntoine> I'm trying to do a simple $('body').animate({offsetTop: 0}) but nothing happens. I don't even have an error in the console
[07:23:18] <workerbe1two> BillCriswell: thank you though. unfortunately I need to go. have a good time
[07:23:29] * hlvwrk gives BillCriswell a ribbon

[07:24:27] <nero> Is there any way to grab all form select elements that are multiple selection elements?  (i.e.- all <select multiple="multiple"> on a page)
[07:25:07] <BillCriswell> nero: select[multiple] should do it.
[07:25:29] <nero> BillCriswell: thanks! :)
[07:29:16] <DevAntoine> first time a jquery function does nothing, I don't understand
[07:29:24] <DevAntoine> maybe it' because it's coupled to angular
[07:37:46] <starsinmypockets> Hmm looking for a very light table sorting plugin - any recommendations? Or just write something myself?

[07:38:46] <starsinmypockets> good answer! ;)
[07:39:50] <BillCriswell> starsinmypockets: I've used tinyort in the past. http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/#sortingtables

[07:42:20] <BillCriswell> Duh. Fucking "Edit/Play" big as shit at the bottom.
[07:42:25] <decx> lol
[07:43:18] <DevAntoine> anyclue about .animate() not working?
[07:43:42] <BillCriswell> decx: Seeming like a lot of fun haa

[07:45:03] <starsinmypockets> BillCriswell - looking at that - tx
[07:45:10] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: What's "not working" exactly?
[07:45:20] <BillCriswell> starsinmypockets: No problem!
[07:45:30] <decx> had the editor separately just to build a level, but the live edit worked like a charm on first try directly with the game
[07:45:50] <decx> and you know if something works on the first try, there's magic involved

[07:47:46] <BillCriswell> I think you just want { top: 0 }
[07:48:48] <BillCriswell> Not sure you can animate body.
[07:48:56] <BillCriswell> Unless you mean to be scrolling?
[07:49:01] <BillCriswell> Whole lot of ifs here.
[07:49:51] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: yes, I want my page to scroll to top
[07:50:16] <decx> why do i have the sudden urge to quote led zeppelin
[07:50:24] <decx> wanna whole lotta ifs
[07:50:30] <BillCriswell> I think you'd actually want $(window).animate({ scrollTop: 0 });
[07:50:36] <BillCriswell> A whole lotta ifs.
[07:50:59] <decx> way way down inside honey, you need it, i'm gonna give you my ifs...
[07:52:49] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: http://jsbin.com/bajujibi/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[07:52:58] <BillCriswell> I made a mistake, you did want body.
[07:56:10] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: in fact it seems that only the html tag works here
[07:56:23] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: neither the window object nor the body tag work
[07:56:30] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Might need to do both.
[07:57:33] <BillCriswell> body is webkit/blink, html is firefox
[07:57:36] <BillCriswell> That's annoying.
[07:58:25] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: $('html, body')
[07:58:38] <BillCriswell> Yeah, still sucks.
[07:58:45] <decx> you made another mistake
[07:58:53] <decx> anmating scrollTop
[07:58:56] <decx> i*
[07:59:14] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: why?
[07:59:17] <BillCriswell> decx: I concur. Clients love that shit though.
[07:59:27] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: but I don't understand the doc: « An object of CSS properties and values that the animation will move toward. » "scrollTop" ain't a css property
[08:00:00] <BillCriswell> offsetTop isn't either.
[08:00:04] <decx> that's why you give them subtle parallax background for that extra bit of zazz ;)
[08:00:15] <BillCriswell> You're a parallax master.
[08:00:24] <decx> hey you saw the 5 lines it took
[08:00:39] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: true. But then, how is it working?
[08:00:41] <LeonardDa> Hi guys. I want to write a script, which logs into a page by sending username and password. But how can I avoid that someone who has access to my pc can read the password from the jquery-script?
[08:00:57] <decx> background-position: x/10, x/5, x/3 was all it took
[08:01:41] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: "In addition to style properties, some non-style properties such as scrollTop and scrollLeft, as well as custom properties, can be animated." from the docs.
[08:01:49] <decx> i'm gonna make my own to top button, with blackjack and hookers (and the home key)
[08:02:31] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: You can't avoid that. You need server side authentication.
[08:02:44] <BillCriswell> decx: Buttons are fun.
[08:03:22] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: my bad, thanks
[08:03:23] <decx> you arent one of those people with topical buttons on your jacket are you
[08:03:37] <decx> on the fedora even
[08:03:39] <LeonardDa> BillCriswell: So there is no way of doing it client-side?
[08:04:13] <BillCriswell> decx: Nope. I am very plain.
[08:04:39] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: Now way that's foolproof.
[08:04:44] <decx> phew, i thought i had to break off all communication ^^
[08:05:15] <BillCriswell> I'm like Doug Funny. I have a closet of basically the same clothes.
[08:05:43] <decx> at least you wont have to think about what to wear
[08:05:49] <BillCriswell> Exactly.
[08:05:57] <decx> i do the same thing basicly
[08:06:02] <decx> because i work from home i'm always naked
[08:06:11] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[08:06:14] <decx> touching myself right now
[08:06:22] <BillCriswell> That a boy.
[08:06:42] <LeonardDa> Can you recommend me some good action movies?
[08:06:55] <decx> terminator 2
[08:07:11] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: The Raid: Redeption
[08:07:14] <BillCriswell> Redemption
[08:07:22] <NoiseEee> i just saw that arcade game for the first time in forever, decx
[08:07:22] <BillCriswell> It's like... 5 minutes of dialog tops.
[08:07:52] <decx> there are still arcade games?
[08:07:56] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899353/
[08:08:26] <decx> is that the asian movie with the crazy driving sequence?
[08:09:07] <BillCriswell> decx: I think the second one has some crazy driving going on, not the first one though.
[08:09:38] <BillCriswell> This one is literally just dudes going up the floors of a building killing a shit load of people very graphically.
[08:10:31] <BillCriswell> It's also very clever no matter how "boring" that description sounds.
[08:10:53] <decx> BillCriswell http://gfycat.com/ThatChiefBeaver
[08:11:11] <BillCriswell> They're nuts.
[08:13:13] <BillCriswell> The trailer for it is actually pretty tame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkULMOFpuCo
[08:14:22] <LeonardDa> Ok. I'm looking to the trailers of the movies. Let's have a look :)
[08:15:40] <thebope> The Raid?
[08:15:46] <thebope> That movie is unbelievably awesome
[08:16:03] <BillCriswell> It sure is.
[08:16:09] <thebope> The action scenes are gruesome
[08:16:12] <thebope> Very realistic
[08:16:15] <thebope> it's awesome
[08:16:38] <thebope> I don't think I saw Redeption
[08:16:42] <thebope> Is it Redemption?
[08:17:12] <paulvd> Hello, trying to add a line break in the middle of a sentence but its not working? http://jsfiddle.net/6MRmU/ its just showing plain text
[08:17:18] <BillCriswell> thebope: Yeah, that's the first one.
[08:17:26] <thebope> oh I saw the first one
[08:17:30] <thebope> but not the second I think
[08:17:46] <BillCriswell> paulvd: Change .text to .html
[08:17:53] <BillCriswell> thebope: I didn't see the second either.
[08:18:11] <thebope> It has a better rating on IMDB than the first one
[08:18:13] <paulvd> ah
[08:18:15] <thebope> Maybe I'll watch it tongiht
[08:18:22] <paulvd> how can i wrap the second line with a span ?
[08:18:59] <paulvd> so Outdoor <br /><span>Furniture</span>
[08:19:19] <BillCriswell> Is it only ever two words?
[08:19:30] <BillCriswell> thebope: Thinking of doing the same.
[08:19:41] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-XZf1a6_R4 is another good one.
[08:20:18] <BillCriswell> paulvd: or do you always want the last line in a span?
[08:20:49] <paulvd> BillCriswell: sorry I did it already
[08:20:56] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:21:07] <LeonardDa> Ok. Now the movies look pretty exaggerated. Are there any "good" movies, it doesn't have to be "action" :)
[08:22:10] <thebope> LeonardDa, The Raid is definitely a good movie
[08:22:15] <thebope> There's not many facts on this earth
[08:22:20] <thebope> but that's one of them
[08:22:21] <thebope> ;-)
[08:22:27] <thebope> Some people don't like action movies though
[08:22:30] <BillCriswell> Good is too relative a term haha
[08:22:39] <thebope> I dunno, I thought it was almost realistic feeling
[08:22:44] <thebope> Well
[08:22:44] <LeonardDa> I thought of something more realistic like "Non Stop"
[08:22:54] <thebope> the one guy was a total animal
[08:23:02] <thebope> Probably not many people could do what he does
[08:23:04] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: Is that the one the dude has to charge himself like a battery?
[08:23:09] <thebope> but it's not like Crouching Tiger
[08:23:34] <BillCriswell> That's a pretty movie.
[08:23:54] <LeonardDa> :). I'm still not convinced of your taste
[08:24:10] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: You said action, The Raid is 100% raw action.
[08:24:17] <LeonardDa> It is really unrealistic to see people who fly like birds in the air
[08:25:02] <LeonardDa> Movies like "Inception" or "Gran Torino" are good ones
[08:25:08] <BillCriswell> That's action?
[08:25:23] <BillCriswell> Our definitions differ greatly.
[08:25:24] <LeonardDa> No. I only need movies which are good ones
[08:25:28] <systemfault> I didn’t like inception at all :(
[08:25:34] <LeonardDa> systemfault: why?
[08:25:54] <BillCriswell> Memento was the movie that got me into movies.
[08:25:58] <LeonardDa> systemfault: Because it caused a "systemfault" in your brain as it was complex? :)
[08:26:13] <BillCriswell> My second favorite movie onto to City Of God.
[08:26:19] <LeonardDa> systemfault: Only joking
[08:26:20] <BillCriswell> movie only to*
[08:26:26] <systemfault> LeonardDa: Not sure why… probably because I was expecting more when I saw it.
[08:26:55] <BillCriswell> I think Memento beats the shit out of Inception.
[08:27:03] <systemfault> LeonardDa: My friends were like.. OMG, best movie ever
[08:27:04] <LeonardDa> BillCriswell: :D
[08:27:12] <systemfault> Memento was awesome
[08:27:31] <BillCriswell> The whole Dark Knight series was incredible as well.
[08:27:45] <BillCriswell> Over all insanely talented, Inception didn't do much for me though.
[08:27:48] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Batman?
[08:27:53] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:27:59] <BillCriswell> Christopher Nolan.
[08:28:07] <systemfault> I only liked the second movie :P
[08:28:20] <systemfault> The first one was basically a remake of “The Shadow"
[08:28:25] <LeonardDa> I like movies like "Tron"
[08:28:26] <systemfault> And the last one was meh
[08:28:30] <LeonardDa> "Tron: Legacy"
[08:28:52] <systemfault> Batman Begins, The Shadow… 90% alike :P
[08:28:55] <BillCriswell> systemfault: My favorite was Rises.
[08:29:05] <systemfault> Oh, really :)
[08:29:29] <BillCriswell> The Joker is my favorite character pretty much of all times. Always hope he pulls it off haha.
[08:29:35] <systemfault> Yes
[08:29:38] <LeonardDa> I wish that there will be another movie like "Tron: Legacy in the future"
[08:30:04] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: Battle Royale is good and about 90% action.
[08:30:27] <BillCriswell> It's the original Hunger Games.
[08:30:34] <systemfault> I love intelligent vilains like joker… this is what I missed from The Dark Knight Rises
[08:30:35] <BillCriswell> but way more graphic.
[08:31:20] <systemfault> BillCriswell: I have to see Battle Royale, it’s the second time someone mentions that movie to me.
[08:31:27] <BillCriswell> systemfault: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke I loved this.
[08:31:48] <BillCriswell> systemfault: If you're seen hunger games it's basically that, just like... 10 years before hunger games haha
[08:33:10] <LeonardDa> Ok. I have different taste than you :). I like stuff like "Tron: Legacy" or "Non Stop". I'm looking for good movies for days but I have no success in it.
[08:34:17] <systemfault> BTW…  Have you seen Oblivion?
[08:34:17] <BillCriswell> systemfault: The girl Gogo from Kill Bill is in Battle Royale.
[08:34:32] <BillCriswell> I have not.
[08:34:32] <systemfault> I thought that Oblivion was a rip off of “Moon”
[08:34:47] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Cool
[08:35:11] <BillCriswell> LeonardDa: I will judge you based on this one question: Do you like Pulp Fiction?
[08:35:33] <LeonardDa> Wow. Oblivion convinced me
[08:37:58] <LeonardDa> BillCriswell: Yes I watched that movie and I like it very much
[08:38:02] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:38:30] <BillCriswell> You seem to like the hallywoodish action.
[08:38:42] <LeonardDa> BillCriswell: Yes :D
[08:39:55] <decx> terminator 2
[08:40:00] <LeonardDa> BillCriswell: But somehow I'm not good in finding good movies like that
[08:40:03] <Velveeta> they're making another terminator movie
[08:40:23] <decx> that careboat sailed when they made 3
[08:40:52] <Velveeta> yuuuuup
[08:41:09] <Velveeta> i noticed it the other day on imdb by accident, when looking at some actor's page, and i was like "they're making another one?!"
[08:41:39] <BillCriswell> I still think The Raid is top notch.
[08:42:07] <BillCriswell> http://eloquentjavascript.net/ hell yeah second edition.
[08:42:22] <decx> what's with the birds always
[08:43:00] <BillCriswell> I have no idea.
[08:43:10] <BillCriswell> Maybe since they're related to dinosaurs and dinosaurs were awesome?
[08:44:00] <decx> maybe because it's poultry and devs from other languages think js is paltry
[08:44:06] <LeonardDa> Ok. I'm giving up
[08:45:17] <BillCriswell> decx: https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10262129_10151992181510741_1905258441422032091_n.jpg tell me you wouldn't read a book with this bad ass on the cover?
[08:45:32] <BillCriswell> The bird is cooler than I can ever possibly be.
[08:46:04] <decx> a mammal would be cooler, mammal represent !
[08:46:09] <decx> *s
[08:47:07] <BillCriswell> Like a dolphin?
[08:48:01] <decx> for example
[08:48:17] <decx> closer common ancestor than these raptor bitches
[08:48:28] <Robr3rd> Using jQuery UI's datepicker, how do you set a minDate and maxDate as a non-dynamic, static, known date? All I can find is information about the threshold being relative to another datepicker or (example) "new Date(2014, 07, 30)" however that also did not work.
[08:50:02] <rahuldroy> hey guys, what is a good obscuration services for jquery code?
[08:50:29] <decx> uglifyJS
[08:51:51] <BillCriswell> Robr3rd: Not following you. Why wouldn't that work?
[08:52:53] <devnill> does anyone know how the $.ajax crossDomain parameter is set? I'm having trouble finding it in the source
[08:53:25] <Robr3rd> BillCriswell, Well, since I am populating it with server-side code, it is entirely possible that I had an error on *that* side, and if you are saying that that should work then I will investigate further on that side of the code.
[08:53:44] <rahuldroy> decx: doesn't break jquery code?
[08:54:14] <decx> why would it
[08:54:23] <BillCriswell> Robr3rd: Is your issue getting a date that comes from the server into the new Date() format?
[08:57:36] <Robr3rd> BillCriswell, Basically, yes. Although Isolved my problem. It really was as simple as a syntax error on the server-side. (And yes, I was pulling a date from a database and formatting it for JavaScript.)
[08:57:41] <Robr3rd> In any event, thanks for your time!
[08:58:12] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:58:42] <BillCriswell> Just had to do .sort [style="text-decoration:underline"] {}
[08:58:45] <BillCriswell> I feel terrible.
[08:59:44] <rahuldroy> decx: it only seems to change variable names and doesn't do much more than that :(
[09:03:10] <decx> there are options i guess
[09:03:18] <decx> i only minify
[09:03:34] <decx> further obfuscation goes against my principles
[09:06:11] <decx> for example, this is just stupid: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/JuDL6/
[09:06:30] <rahuldroy> goes against mine too, but my client was shocked when I told him how javascript works
[09:07:51] <rahuldroy> how did you manage to make that fiddle?
[09:08:13] <decx> http://utf-8.jp/public/jjencode.html
[09:22:48] <duch_kazatel> welp
[09:23:02] <BillCriswell> We can all just go home.
[09:23:12] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:23:20] <decx> done
[09:23:57] <duch_kazatel> pack it up.  our work is done here. let's rename the channel ##decx and he can show us all the neat shit he builds
[09:24:34] <decx> it's #decx because it's directly affiliated with me
[09:24:39] <BillCriswell> He showed me a little game thing with the ability to edit the levels earlier.
[09:24:53] <duch_kazatel> nah it's ##decx because you're more than an affiliation - you're a fucking topic
[09:25:03] <decx> shit thats deep
[09:25:13] <duch_kazatel> that's what we used to do here.
[09:25:24] <decx> being deep?
[09:25:42] <decx> now it's all lacking delegation and attr instead of prop :(
[09:25:51] <duch_kazatel> pushed boundaries, unlocked secrets of the universe, etc.
[09:25:56] <duch_kazatel> :(
[09:26:19] <decx> i stumbled over a nice shuffling algorithm
[09:26:22] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yeah he showed me that last night and I was pretty surprised how few lines of js it took and then he was all "yeah well math"
[09:26:36] <decx> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher–Yates_shuffle
[09:26:46] <duch_kazatel> is that a dance move or what?
[09:26:48] <decx> for(var j, x, i = o.length; i; j = Math.floor(Math.random() * i), x = o[--i], o[i] = o[j], o[j] = x);
[09:26:59] <decx> randomizes an array
[09:27:03] <decx> or a jq collection
[09:35:07] <skullcrasher> hey there
[09:35:16] <Es0teric> when using sortable/draggable and a click event is already binded to an element with a open/closed state that can be dragged/sorted… do you stop the click event with open state by referencing the sortable in draggable?
[09:35:32] <skullcrasher> is there a possibility to search for an object by given id (in a multi dimensional array/object)
[09:35:51] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher could you clarify what you mean?
[09:36:28] <BillCriswell> decx: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/ ever see this? Pretty awesome demonstration of it.
[09:36:40] <maxwell9> anybody experienced issues doing an ajax request with the ci csrf token enabled?
[09:36:50] <skullcrasher> i use the nestedSortable plugin
[09:37:35] <skullcrasher> there is an option to output the list hierarchy, which is a multidimensional object/array
[09:37:47] <decx> sweet visualization BillCriswell
[09:37:56] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher could you share an example of that object in a fiddle or something similar?
[09:38:03] <skullcrasher> sec
[09:38:23] <skullcrasher> you mean the structure?
[09:38:29] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[09:38:34] <duch_kazatel> or an example of the data.
[09:38:43] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, the bottom one is great.
[09:38:45] <decx> BillCriswell i can actually understand it presented like this :>
[09:39:05] <duch_kazatel> the latter would be far more helpful, since I could give you a functioning example with that.
[09:39:09] <skullcrasher> http://ilikenwf.github.io/example.html
[09:39:16] <skullcrasher> this is the exapmle in the documentation
[09:39:24] <skullcrasher> the last point: hierarchy
[09:39:28] <BillCriswell> decx: It definitely kind of helps me
[09:39:52] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher woah what.  that's not a javascript object.
[09:40:00] <BillCriswell> decx: All the stuff on that site makes me feel useless haha
[09:40:19] <skullcrasher> it's an array of objects
[09:40:21] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher in fact, none of these are outputting actual js objkects.
[09:40:29] <skullcrasher> but every object in there can have an array of objects :P
[09:40:36] <decx> BillCriswell it only motivates me to get better
[09:40:55] <skullcrasher> duch_kazatel: in debugger it is
[09:41:04] <skullcrasher> or console
[09:41:05] <duch_kazatel> please share the example in the debugger.
[09:41:13] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I have a hard time thinking of what to do to try and learn something. If I'm not applying it to something it just kind of... vanishes.
[09:42:07] <BillCriswell> decx: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/compare.html still also interesting
[09:42:17] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: i have that same problem lol
[09:42:32] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: It sucks.
[09:42:38] <Es0teric> it does..
[09:42:40] <BillCriswell> I need like an imaginary boss telling me to do shit.
[09:42:59] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell write me a true cross-platform static site generator.
[09:43:04] <duch_kazatel> *bam* there you go.
[09:43:45] <decx> jekyll?
[09:43:46] <BillCriswell> I'd probably just present jekyll haha
[09:43:52] <decx> hehe
[09:43:54] <duch_kazatel> *that isn't jekyll
[09:43:57] <BillCriswell> or mixture if you wanted a gui.
[09:45:07] <skullcrasher> duch_kazatel: ?
[09:45:14] <skullcrasher> how in the debugger?
[09:45:29] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher or console  or whatever.  i want to see the actual data.
[09:45:37] <duch_kazatel> not some visual representation.
[09:45:44] <duch_kazatel> you can stringify it.
[09:49:06] <BillCriswell> I keep finding my cat's code in my JS files.
[09:49:22] <BillCriswell> There's always like '][[\=0-9- or something on a line haha
[09:49:39] <drusepth> politely let your cat know he needs to write tests first, and that you won't allow changes that don't pass them
[09:49:46] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[09:50:30] <BillCriswell> They're all rude.
[09:51:18] <skullcrasher> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/X8fDW/
[09:51:56] <skullcrasher> there is output to console
[09:52:17] <skullcrasher> on button click now too
[09:52:39] <duch_kazatel> okayu
[09:53:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/AwkVb/ so this is the data.
[09:53:49] <duch_kazatel> all you had to do was console.log(JSON.stringify(hiered)); and copy the output in your console.
[09:54:34] <duch_kazatel> so you want to recursively find the object with a given ID?
[09:55:15] <skullcrasher> yes
[09:55:48] <Es0teric> when using sortable/draggable and a click event is already binded to an element with a open/closed state that can be dragged/sorted… do you stop the click event with open state by referencing the sortable in draggable?
[09:56:24] <skullcrasher> i get the relocated item, if you mean that, yes
[09:56:31] <duch_kazatel> "relocated item"?
[09:56:39] <skullcrasher> the dragged item
[09:56:51] <skullcrasher> and it's parent
[09:57:02] <duch_kazatel> i feel like your question and what you're trying to do are two different things.
[09:57:14] <skullcrasher> no
[09:57:26] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[09:57:32] <skullcrasher> if it's a draggable/sortable doesn't matter
[09:57:49] <skullcrasher> it's all about the data structure
[09:58:00] <skullcrasher> that the toHierarchy function outputs
[09:58:23] <duch_kazatel> okay - you want to look up how to write a function that iterates recursively over an array.
[09:59:56] <skullcrasher> ok
[10:00:16] <skullcrasher> thought there is already something in this direction
[10:00:22] <skullcrasher> built in
[10:01:07] <duch_kazatel> not that i'm aware of.
[10:01:31] <skullcrasher> read about grep, but that was slightly wrong :)
[10:01:46] <duch_kazatel> right.  there's no builtin method i'm aware of to handle something like that.
[10:02:35] <skullcrasher> so basically i could look at .find() i guess
[10:02:46] <duch_kazatel> .find() is for the DOM.
[10:02:49] <duch_kazatel> not for data.
[10:02:58] <skullcrasher> yes sure
[10:03:18] <skullcrasher> just how it's done
[10:03:30] <duch_kazatel> did you try the search i suggested?
[10:03:59] <skullcrasher> yes, also
[10:04:31] <skullcrasher> that's why i found that comparison
[10:04:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:05:10] <skullcrasher> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2203958/jquery-recursive-iteration-over-objects
[10:05:17] <duch_kazatel> don't use jquery for this.
[10:05:54] <decx> what's going on here
[10:06:22] <duch_kazatel> he's trying to recursively iterate through dynamically nested arrays to find an object with a given ID.
[10:06:37] <decx> yuk
[10:06:51] <skullcrasher> sry im not a pro :/
[10:06:59] <duch_kazatel> not about being a pro.
[10:07:05] <duch_kazatel> it's a good learning experience.
[10:07:13] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:11:57] <duch_kazatel> back
[10:15:34] <ktb> hello!! Let's say for the sake of argument I have a small space on my site where I can dynamically add input texts in a div tag. Simultaneously I add a few hidden elements which correspond the the text elements, but are located in different divs. How can I remove (by clicking on a button) the added input text AND the hidden elements? Right now I managed to only remove the texts..
[10:16:29] <BillCriswell> ktb: How do they correspond?
[10:17:45] <ktb> BillCriswell: only theoretically. For example say I have added a text fruits, the corresponding hidden element would include various fruits like apples,oranges,etc. The correspondance is not visible in the code though
[10:18:07] <ktb> meaning I they do not have the same class
[10:18:09] <BillCriswell> When you're adding the elements how are you adding them?
[10:18:39] <ktb> BillCriswell: I add them by append() to an existing span
[10:18:53] <BillCriswell> Can you replicate what you have at jsbin.com
[10:18:54] <BillCriswell> ?
[10:19:17] <ktb> BillCriswell: I will try, please wait a moment
[10:20:47] <duch_kazatel> wow jsfiddle is slow today
[10:21:02] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It was slow last night as well. Not sure what's up.
[10:21:37] <BillCriswell> Probably one of remysharp's diabolical plans.
[10:23:26] <duch_kazatel> >:D
[10:23:31] <tw2113> remy does jsbin
[10:23:36] <tw2113> ohhh
[10:23:37] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[10:23:38] <tw2113> i see what you mean
[10:23:38] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:23:53] <tw2113> coffee hasn't fully kicked in yet i think
[10:25:41] <skullcrasher> think got it almost :)
[10:27:07] <duch_kazatel> it's been a while since i last dealt with recursion, but it'd look something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/njdbu/
[10:27:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/njdbu/1/ <- with unbroken indentation
[10:29:49] <duch_kazatel> critiques welcome
[10:36:38] <ktb> BillCriswell: I can't get jsbin to work, but I have pasted the code here http://pastebin.com/Jwv2HL1R just to give you a better picture
[10:37:12] <BillCriswell> ktb: Sweet.
[10:37:22] <BillCriswell> ktb: Do you actually need them in separate areas?
[10:37:44] <ktb> BillCriswell: yes this is crucial
[10:37:49] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:38:48] <BillCriswell> ktb: Lots of ways to do this, thinking of one with a clear reasoning behind it.
[10:39:05] <dokma> on('paste', ...)  triggers before the pasted text is visible in the textarea
[10:39:11] <dokma> any way to trigger after?
[10:39:33] <BillCriswell> dokma: How about just on('input')? SHould it only happen on paste?
[10:39:46] <dokma> only on paste
[10:40:18] <dokma> but I assume the on('input') behaves the same way
[10:40:34] <dokma> the problem is that the event triggers an upload and if there's a lot of text
[10:40:46] <dokma> the textarea will be empty until the upload finishes
[10:40:50] <dokma> which is kind of sluggish
[10:41:32] <dokma> I've just seen a hack with on('paste', function() { setTimeout(..., 10)});
[10:41:44] <dokma> that's my best solution so far...
[10:41:44] <BillCriswell> dokma: That's pretty clever haha.
[10:42:17] <dokma> yeah, programmers are rather smart people. they just don't know how to get ass...
[10:42:42] <BillCriswell> dokma: That's simply not true on both points.
[10:42:55] <dokma> just a rather good heuristic
[10:43:44] <BillCriswell> ktb: What you can do is make a reference to the hidden input in a data attribute.
[10:44:10] <BillCriswell> ktb: or as you're making theme inputs build a counter and give them ids like input-1 and hidden-input-1 and handle it that way.
[10:45:27] <s2013> can someone tell me why all the tab content loads at first? then its correct once you click on a tab http://jsfiddle.net/NG7u3/
[10:47:30] <decx> they are all active what do you expect
[10:47:53] <decx> right there in the classes of all 3 panes: *active*
[10:48:22] <s2013> where?
[10:48:27] <s2013> only one li is active in the code
[10:48:36] <Zzaichik> ^^wrong
[10:48:42] <Zzaichik> they all have the classname of active on load
[10:48:43] <decx> *the rock* IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT THE LI SAYS
[10:48:59] <decx> the divs with the pane itself counts
[10:49:16] <decx> <div class='tab-pane fade in active' id='summary'>
[10:49:33] <s2013>   <div class='tab-pane fade in active' id='venues'>
[10:49:34] <s2013> oh that?
[10:49:43] <decx> indeed
[10:49:55] <frank_o> s2013: Why do you even use li's there?
[10:49:57] <s2013> hmm i wonder how that happen
[10:50:06] <s2013> i am not a front end person. :\
[10:50:10] <decx> well you put it there so
[10:50:15] <s2013> i didnt.
[10:50:19] <s2013> atleast i dont remember it
[10:50:24] <s2013> so i probably screwed it up somewhere
[10:50:25] <s2013> thanks
[10:50:27] <decx> someone wrote it in the markup ^^
[10:50:39] <frank_o> When li's were created by the W3C their intended use was typographical lists, not "any collection of items"
[10:51:03] <frank_o> Collections of items, imho, are best divided by <div>
[10:51:03] <decx> oh be quiet mister 'i just put it in a global var' ;)
[10:51:20] <frank_o> decx :love:
[10:51:29] <decx> a list of links is definitely that, a list
[10:51:30] <frank_o> Sup dawg
[10:52:18] <BillCriswell> ktb: Does my explanation make sense?
[10:52:36] <s2013> thanks
[10:56:34] <ktb> BillCriswell: Thank you for your help. I finally got this working (with event.target.id).
[10:56:56] <BillCriswell> ktb: Sounds like you might have two of the same ids?
[10:57:10] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:58:35] <ktb> BillCriswell: No, I named the spans of my remove button just 1,2,3 etc. and then deleted the elements by $("hidden"+event.target.id).remove(); . Probably not the most elegant way, but it works.
[10:58:53] <BillCriswell> ktb: Yeah, whatever works!
[10:58:58] <BillCriswell> For the most part.
[10:59:02] <BillCriswell> That's not too evil.
[10:59:12] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher you see the fiddle i pasted?
[10:59:57] <skullcrasher> yes just saw it :9
[11:00:05] <skullcrasher> got similar to equal result :)
[11:00:26] <skullcrasher> http://jsfiddle.net/NQTXh/
[11:00:31] <BillCriswell> ktb: Here is what I ended up with cause I didn't like any of the things I came up with: http://jsbin.com/saceduna/1/edit?js,output
[11:00:32] <duch_kazatel> recursion is pretty simple once you wrap your head around it.
[11:00:59] <BillCriswell> ktb: Click something in the blue and it'll remove the matching one in the red.
[11:01:15] <skullcrasher> one difficulty was also that i had to use a for loop
[11:01:19] <BillCriswell> I fucking love .data({ someElement: $jQueryObject }) haha
[11:01:23] <skullcrasher> with for(bla in blub) it didn work
[11:01:45] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher for (prop in object) isn't appropriate for arrays.
[11:01:55] <skullcrasher> yes I saw it :D
[11:01:55] <duch_kazatel> that's for objects, and it requires some extra wrangling.
[11:02:31] <BillCriswell> Then you can do $el.data('someElement').jQueryStuffs()
[11:02:31] <skullcrasher> another question
[11:02:34] <BillCriswell> So awesome.
[11:02:42] <skullcrasher> in your fiddle you check for type array
[11:02:56] <skullcrasher> can't the for loop also walk over objects?
[11:03:09] <skullcrasher> so the check isn't necessary or?
[11:03:18] <ktb> BillCriswell: Thanks a lot
[11:03:24] <BillCriswell> ktb: No problem.
[11:03:33] <duch_kazatel> skullcrasher you're confused about what i'm doing in there.
[11:03:57] <skullcrasher> no
[11:04:11] <duch_kazatel> you want to check if the object is an array to know if you should iterate over it or not.
[11:04:21] <skullcrasher> yes it's a type check
[11:04:49] <duch_kazatel> right.  you can't iterate over an object that isn't an array.
[11:04:54] <duch_kazatel> well, you shouldn't try at least.
[11:06:00] <skullcrasher> what would be the difference to typeof?
[11:06:19] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[11:06:50] <skullcrasher> ah just found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/899574/which-is-best-to-use-typeof-or-instanceof
[11:07:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/HV4XG/
[11:08:05] <duch_kazatel> arrays in js are just objects, like everything else.  they treat accessors a little differently and have an automatic lenght property, as well as a few special methods, but they're basically the same.
[11:10:09] <skullcrasher> so I had to check myArray typeof == 'object'
[11:10:19] <duch_kazatel> you don't want to do that.
[11:10:23] <skullcrasher> but would be kinda nonsense
[11:10:30] <duch_kazatel> right.
[11:10:35] <skullcrasher> ok got it :)
[11:11:18] <skullcrasher> thx
[11:11:24] <duch_kazatel> yep
[11:15:57] <frank_o> Can someone confirm that this bug stems from Chrome's mobile emulation? Unable to touch and move iScroll scrolling area after jquery-embedly (https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery) has processed SoundCloud links. Can scroll just fine if disabling mobile emulation's touch emulation, or if disabling mobile emulation altogether.
[11:16:02] <frank_o> The users in #android are able to scroll just fine on their native devices -- leading me to think that this might be Chrome's problem.
[11:23:33] <bradley> is jquery going to move to a modular design similar to YUI? to only load parts of Jquery that are needed?
[11:24:32] <NoiseEee> already there bradley
[11:25:21] <NoiseEee> afaik but i could be wrong
[11:25:48] <NoiseEee> https://github.com/jquery/jquery @ bradley
[11:29:06] <duch_kazatel> they AMD-ified everything iirc.
[11:34:45] <Nevramind> Hello, my name is kia!
[11:34:50] <hlvwrk> Hi kia
[11:34:55] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet you're a bot!
[11:34:58] <Nevramind> I need some help if anyone is available.
[11:35:10] <Nevramind> LOL...I'm not a bot and hello hlvwrk
[11:35:16] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Nevramind
[11:35:17] <b-ot> Nevramind: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:35:36] <Nevramind> Oh, I see...got it
[11:35:51] <Nevramind> I'm trying to figure out how to get the pages for my mobile website indexed.
[11:36:03] <Nevramind> Or if this is already taken care of because I used jquery to build it
[11:36:09] <hlvwrk> how does that have anything to do with jquery :o
[11:36:20] <Nevramind> I'm using jquery mobile
[11:36:21] <duch_kazatel> they're confused about how indexing works :)
[11:36:38] <duch_kazatel> Nevramind how would google find your site?
[11:36:48] <hlvwrk> Nevramind: research getting mobile sites indexed on google. it has very little to do with jquery or the technology you used to build it
[11:36:52] <Nevramind> and, of course, the jquery mobile site referred me to this irc thingamajangem
[11:37:02] <duch_kazatel> also: do you rely on javascriprt for everything to work?
[11:37:03] <hlvwrk> lol
[11:37:07] <Nevramind> Well, jquery mobile uses ajax
[11:37:19] <hlvwrk> right but none of that has anything to do with how the site gets indexed
[11:37:22] <hlvwrk> like NONE of it :3
[11:37:35] <decx> it does actually
[11:37:41] <hlvwrk> It really doesn't though
[11:37:43] <Nevramind> thank you decx
[11:37:47] <decx> depending on your url structure
[11:37:55] <Nevramind> right...and jquery mobile uses ajax
[11:37:58] <hlvwrk> that's your URL structure, not the technology you used to build your site
[11:38:19] <decx> in jq mobile that's a bit intertwined afaik
[11:38:30] <Nevramind> I only have 16 out of 340 something pages indexed and I read on google that I need to make changes to the strucutre such as add #! in the link structure
[11:39:02] <Nevramind> I'm wondering if jquery mobile has already considered this
[11:39:13] <Nevramind> Or if I need to go in and manually handle this programmatically
[11:39:31] <duch_kazatel> Nevramind it's more than that.
[11:39:40] <Nevramind> ok...go on..
[11:39:41] <duch_kazatel> you should read the entire guide.
[11:39:48] <duch_kazatel> and/or get a sitemap.
[11:39:54] <duch_kazatel> (go with the sitemap)
[11:39:58] <Nevramind> I have a sitemap
[11:40:03] <duch_kazatel> and you submitted it?
[11:40:09] <Nevramind> Yes
[11:40:18] <duch_kazatel> okay, and it loads when you disable js?
[11:41:03] <Nevramind> Does what load? Ask that question differently, please? I don't understand.
[11:41:19] <hlvwrk> Does your website have a sitemap?
[11:41:23] <hlvwrk> Just curious
[11:41:25] <hlvwrk> can you link your site?
[11:41:33] <Nevramind> Yes, my website has a submitted sitemap.
[11:41:43] <Nevramind> Ok, guys...focus with me...lol
[11:41:51] <hlvwrk> I'm an SEO, and I'm telling you it has very little to do with jquery
[11:41:52] <hlvwrk> :#
[11:41:57] <Nevramind> Jquery mobile uses ajax
[11:42:06] <hlvwrk> right
[11:42:16] <Nevramind> hlv...have you done seo work with a site that navigates using ajax?
[11:42:29] <hlvwrk> Navigates using ajax?
[11:42:36] <duch_kazatel> when you hit any of the non-indexed pages with javascript disabled, does that page load?
[11:42:38] * hlvwrk looks on puzzled
[11:42:44] <Nevramind> Yes...it navigates from page to page dynamically with ajax
[11:42:56] <Nevramind> no, it doesn't kazatel
[11:43:00] <decx> there you go
[11:43:04] <duch_kazatel> that's your problem.
[11:43:10] <duch_kazatel> you need to set up your site so that works.
[11:43:13] <Nevramind> Right...lol...I know that that's my problem
[11:43:15] <duch_kazatel> that is not an "ajax problem"
[11:43:21] <duch_kazatel> nor is that a "jquery mobile problem"
[11:43:24] <decx> you want to at least serve the content
[11:43:34] <Nevramind> Ok dec...tell me more
[11:43:36] <duch_kazatel> that's a developer/architecture/serverside problem.
[11:43:48] <decx> i dont know enough about jqm or your setup to tell you more
[11:44:03] <duch_kazatel> you want your site to respond with the full page without needing any javascript.
[11:44:16] <Nevramind> Back to the original question. I needed to know if jquery mobile already considered this when building that particular...err framework
[11:44:33] <duch_kazatel> back to what I just told you - that's not a javascript problem.
[11:44:35] <duch_kazatel> that's a server problem.
[11:45:16] <Nevramind> I'm certain you have the right answer duch, it's just not coordinate with this particular question
[11:45:38] <Nevramind> The link structure is modified a certain way for these situations...
[11:45:41] <drej> guys, he's an SEO
[11:45:44] <drej> :)
[11:46:01] <duch_kazatel> Nevramind your question comes froma  false premise.
[11:46:01] <Nevramind> He's a search engine optimization...yes, lol
[11:46:05] <geijutsuka> Hi there... this is probably a rookie question, but I'm still learning... so here goes: I want to replace the string "and every" *several* times within one bigger string.... I have a function that uses replace.text("and every", " "); but it only changes the first instance of "and every" it comes across. Is there a way to loop within a string?
[11:46:21] <duch_kazatel> geijutsuka you want a regular expression.
[11:46:28] <Jattenalle> regex geijutsuka
[11:46:33] <duch_kazatel> .replace(/and every/g, '');
[11:46:35] <PantsOfChoco> jquery people whats the javascript way of doing an in line if statement for variable declaration, like x = 4 iftest>1 else x 5
[11:46:48] <duch_kazatel> PantsOfChoco you want a conditional/ternary.
[11:46:54] <Nevramind> I'm thinking that this is a chat more for folks who deal mostly in the less specified realm of jquery. I'll try another medium.
[11:46:58] <PantsOfChoco> can i do it in a single line?
[11:47:00] <Nevramind> You guys take care.
[11:47:02] <lpommers_> you might want to use 'i' as well to check for case sensitivity as well
[11:47:02] <duch_kazatel> Nevramind i do.
[11:47:08] <decx> x = (blah) ? 1 : 2;
[11:47:10] <duch_kazatel> Nevramind i do full stack.
[11:47:12] <Jattenalle> PantsOfChoco, ((test > 1) : x = 4 ? x = 5)
[11:47:21] <PantsOfChoco> youre the man love ya
[11:47:27] <Nevramind> so duch I need you to understand my question
[11:47:30] <decx> you can also stack
[11:47:40] <Nevramind> and I'm thinking that you can't really understand what I'm trying to get at
[11:47:45] <geijutsuka> duch_kazatel & Jattenalle: ahhhh... ok I'll try that :D thank you!
[11:47:48] <duch_kazatel> lmao "can't"
[11:47:52] <decx> var x = (blah) ? (1, y = 3) : (2, y = 4);
[11:47:55] <duch_kazatel> Nevramind you're asking if seo implications were considered by the people who make jquery mobile, right?
[11:47:56] <Jattenalle> yeah, what decx said PantsOfChoco
[11:47:57] <drej> Nevramind jquery mobile is effectively a single page site
[11:48:04] <Nevramind> So, you may be very right coming from your perspective but, you still aren't addressing what I'm asking
[11:48:05] <drej> Nevramind all its content and "pages" cannot be indexed
[11:48:07] <drej> if thats what youre asking
[11:48:14] <drej> i missed the original question
[11:48:19] <duch_kazatel> drej actually it can if you set it up correctly.
[11:48:26] <duch_kazatel> Nevramind is my assessment correct?
[11:48:34] <Jattenalle> PantsOfChoco, var x = ((test > 1) : 4 ? 5);
[11:48:37] <drej> if you have stubs of dummy pages, sure
[11:48:38] <Nevramind> No, I'm asking about making sure my pages can be crawled if I used the jquery mobile library to build my site
[11:48:54] <thinkxl> there are certain ways that google can index Ajax stuff, and couple months ago, Google announced that google bot will be running javascript
[11:48:59] <drej> Nevramind thats what im talking about, by default, no they cannot be
[11:49:01] <Nevramind> If not, I need to know what to do to the link structure as per google's suggestions
[11:49:04] <drej> however, you can make it do that
[11:49:15] <duch_kazatel> Nevramind the link structure changes also require server-side changes.
[11:49:22] <duch_kazatel> if you're talking about the hashbang setup, at least.
[11:49:33] <drej> Nevramind https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/learn-more?csw=1
[11:49:35] <drej> is a good read
[11:49:52] <Nevramind> Yes, see...my site shows pretty urls...so, I'm not sure if the underlying structur is the hashbang
[11:50:06] <Nevramind> I see drej
[11:50:07] <thinkxl> Nevramind: you need to do yourpage.com/strong-keyword-here/
[11:50:11] <Nevramind> thanks thinkxl
[11:50:31] <thinkxl> but routing only with javascript you won't get that
[11:50:36] <thinkxl> you will get yourpage.com/#your-keyword
[11:50:49] <thinkxl> so you need to route your app in the serverside
[11:51:54] <rakm> is there a function likes .each, that is specifically for html elements, where the callback gives you the wrapped jquery element, instead of the raw node?
[11:52:03] <decx> i guess jqm creates nice urls with pushstate?
[11:52:13] <Nevramind> Yes...thanks...maybe I can find some people who really go deep into jquery mobile...thank you all for all your help
[11:52:20] <duch_kazatel> rakm you can use $(this) for the jquery wrapped node.
[11:52:22] <Nevramind> have a good good day
[11:52:31] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:52:33] <rakm> so I don't have to wrap it inside the callback like this -->  $('.slide').each(function(index, element) { $(element) })
[11:52:34] <drej> haha
[11:52:43] <drej> duch_kazatel he didnt like the answer, so he thinks he'll find a more favourable one
[11:52:43] <thinkxl> decx: but you can't get access the url like app.com/here/
[11:52:45] <duch_kazatel> rakm you'll have to wrap it.
[11:52:52] <duch_kazatel> dref I know.
[11:52:52] <thinkxl> decx: I think
[11:52:57] <rakm> :( poopy
[11:53:00] <rakm> ok thanks for the confirmation
[11:53:02] <decx> thinkxl not unless you rewrite it serverside
[11:53:31] <thinkxl> decx: yes, serverside routes, but you are routing in the back-end and the front-end :/
[11:53:33] <duch_kazatel> err drej i know.  he'll learn.
[11:53:38] <decx> from like /tag to /jqm-assets/content/tag.html or whatever jqm does
[11:53:41] <thinkxl> decx: using hash saves you a lot of time
[11:53:49] <thinkxl> decx: on SPA
[11:53:53] <thinkxl> specifically
[11:53:57] <decx> cant confirm i'm always slow on hash
[11:54:19] <duch_kazatel> thinkxl hashes don't get passed to the server, btw ;_
[11:54:19] <BillCriswell> I haven't smokes hash since high school.
[11:54:30] <drej> BillCriswell well we should definitely remedy that
[11:54:32] <thinkxl> duch_kazatel: :/ crap
[11:54:48] <thinkxl> duch_kazatel: what about back-end rest api and front-end hash url structure
[11:54:51] <duch_kazatel> thinkxl https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started -> "Hash fragments are never (by specification) sent to the server as part of an HTTP request."
[11:54:55] <BillCriswell> drej: There's something about the act of smoking that I just don't like haha.
[11:55:05] <BillCriswell> I'll eat a pot brownie no problem, smoking it... ehhh
[11:55:06] <dmsuperman> rakm: you could always write your own method to do that on your project
[11:55:08] <jessica587> Is there a significant chance of breaking something depending on using curly or square braces as showin here http://hastebin.com/olesadubeg.sm
[11:55:28] <drej> BillCriswell fair enough :)
[11:55:28] <thinkxl> duch_kazatel: ignore me, I need to get more into that
[11:55:35] <drej> BillCriswell they DO have vaporizers these days
[11:55:40] <duch_kazatel> jessica587 huh?
[11:55:52] <jessica587> The code has square braces after states : by default but switching to curly braces actually makes everything work as expected duch_kazatel
[11:56:17] <Jattenalle> jessica587, yes
[11:56:18] <BillCriswell> drej: Been wanting to try that.
[11:56:21] <drej> tehy mean different things jessica587
[11:56:26] <duch_kazatel> states: [] is an array - states: {} is an object.
[11:56:26] <drej> square = array; curly = object
[11:56:29] <drej> bam.
[11:56:32] <Jattenalle> jessica587, they mean different things, {} is an object, [] is an array
[11:56:34] <drej> i DO know something!
[11:56:36] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:57:24] <Jattenalle> jessica587, that it works is just luck, use the appropriate brackets
[11:57:44] <jessica587> Okay, so if there's only one item in states : does it matter that it isn't an array?
[11:57:52] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[11:57:58] <duch_kazatel> because arrays and objects are different.
[11:58:07] <jessica587> yeah was just hoping for a no
[11:58:20] <duch_kazatel> why would it matter the number of items?
[11:58:26] <jessica587> it wouldn't
[11:58:39] <jessica587> wordpress plugin broke some other functionality
[11:59:17] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[11:59:31] <lpommers_> no, it is just an array with one item in it
[11:59:55] <lpommers_> oh strach that, i read what your wrote wrong
[12:01:35] <geijutsuka> duch_kazatel++
[12:01:44] <geijutsuka> yay! worked thank you so much :D
[12:04:40] <dmsuperman> rakm: http://jsfiddle.net/3x629/3/#run
[12:07:29] <dmsuperman> rakm: http://jsfiddle.net/3x629/4/#run I should say, so return still works
[12:07:31] <sunbeam> whats a good jquery plugin to change styles of select fields?
[12:07:41] <NoiseEee> CSS
[12:07:53] <systemfault> lol
[12:07:55] <systemfault> Good one NoiseEee
[12:08:16] <lpommers_> ha
[12:08:26] <systemfault> sunbeam: select2 is popular
[12:08:29] <javascript459> alright would the pointed out semicolon http://hastebin.com/ayopakucex.vhdl here break anything since it wasn't there by default?
[12:09:15] <dmsuperman> yes javascript459
[12:09:17] <lpommers_> yeah it does break it.
[12:09:19] <wa5ted> yo #jquery
[12:09:20] <javascript459> yeah.
[12:09:27] <dmsuperman> a semicolon only comes after a complete statement, which would be after the ]
[12:09:37] <lpommers_> as dmsuperman said
[12:09:46] <dmsuperman> in the middle of arrays you would want a comma (but beware IE doesn't support trailing commas in older versions)
[12:09:50] <dmsuperman> perhaps even newer versions...
[12:09:51] <lpommers_> you wouldn't put a  ; for each item in your array
[12:10:35] <javascript459> i see that the other values in the wp.media part don't have a semicolon after them...does states need one?
[12:11:59] <lpommers_> no i don't think so
[12:13:07] <lpommers_> but personally,  i'm a bit confused by what's happening on line 2
[12:15:08] <dmsuperman> probably storing an object into a property as well as keeping a local variable reference... perhaps to help with scope resolution problems farther down? seems a bit confusing though yeah
[12:16:06] <lpommers_> yeah, well i was reading something today about getting undefined (for b) when pull something like var a = b = 3 (for example). Thought something like that might be happening here
[12:16:08] <dmsuperman> Oh I see now that states wasn't even the end of the statement heh, so yeah no semi-colon needed except the very end, where it is. that's all one gigantic statement
[12:17:03] <dmsuperman> and the commat t the end of line 6 is what's called a "trailing comma" and will cause JS errors in IE
[12:17:36] <dmsuperman> same with line 12
[12:21:27] <drej> aka the trolling comma
[12:22:01] <lpommers_> haha, does that affect all versions of IE?
[12:22:40] <dmsuperman> last time I gave a crap about IE it was still an issue... I think that was 8, maybe 9
[12:23:13] <dmsuperman> looks like they may have corrected it in IE9
[12:23:28] <lpommers_> yeah that's what i'm seeing
[12:23:52] <dmsuperman> but only for specific cases haha
[12:26:40] <decx> where do i send my money to make fiddle fast again?

[12:41:47] <zyrax000> hi
[12:43:58] * zyrax1 
[12:59:53] <s2013> if i have 2 lists with the same class name.. how do i select the children of the second class?
[13:00:17] <duch_kazatel> $('.yourClass').eq(1)
[13:00:32] <duch_kazatel> $('.yourClass').eq(1).find('li')
[13:07:46] <s2013> k thanks
[13:08:27] <s2013> duch_kazatel, can i do .find('a>li') ?
[13:08:34] <duch_kazatel> you can do any selector.
[13:08:56] <duch_kazatel> though that's not a  valid structure.
[13:09:05] <lpommers_> yeah you wouldn't have a>li
[13:09:11] <duch_kazatel> li > a
[13:09:37] <s2013> no i have a > li.. i have the a wrapped around the list
[13:09:44] <duch_kazatel> that's not valid.
[13:09:48] <s2013> cause i wanted the whole list box to be clickable. probably did it the wrong way
[13:09:53] <s2013> it does work for me tho :\
[13:10:08] <duch_kazatel> right, because the browser is trying to understand wtf you meant.
[13:10:11] <s2013> $(".venue-list>a>li.active-menu").removeClass("active-menu"); is what i had and it works fine..
[13:10:24] <s2013> actually it used to be #venue-list but i changed it to a class
[13:10:32] <s2013> cause i have that in couple of different places
[13:10:37] <duch_kazatel> you should fix it - the only valid direct child of UL is LI
[13:10:43] <dmsuperman> s2013: what you need to do is just make each li have no padding and have each a take up the full contents of the li
[13:10:46] <duch_kazatel> and if you can take the time to change that, you can change the rest.
[13:10:56] <s2013> i want to do it right
[13:10:58] <dmsuperman> then you can have <li><a> correctly but allow each item to be clickable
[13:11:08] <s2013> dmsuperman, do you have an example of how its done? front end isnt my thing
[13:11:37] <rhizome> how can i switch from using $(document).on("ajax:success", 'selector', function...) for each little event, to something that puts the .on with the selector, to which i can then add events?
[13:11:46] <rhizome> seems like a basic pattern i'm unaware of
[13:11:46] <duch_kazatel> rhizome huh?
[13:13:40] <rhizome> right now i have $(document).on("ajax:success", 'form.edit_thing', handler) and $(document).on("ajax:failure", 'form.edit_thing, handler), etc. and it seems like i should be able to do something like $('form.edit_thing).on(...) (or maybe not .on)
[13:13:57] <duch_kazatel> rhizome you can do that.
[13:14:11] <duch_kazatel> $('form.edit_thing').on('event', function() {});
[13:14:11] <rhizome> "etc." means I'm repeating that for every event type
[13:14:21] <duch_kazatel> one's a delegated listener, the other is a directly bound one.
[13:15:06] <duch_kazatel> if you have multiple events from one element, you can do $(document).on("ajax:failure click mouseup", 'form.edit_thing', handler)
[13:15:06] <rhizome> is my memory wrong that delegation is required if the selector may or may not be on the page at load?
[13:15:18] <duch_kazatel> you are correct with that assesment, yes.
[13:15:28] <duch_kazatel> well, unless you bind after the element is added to the document.
[13:16:08] <dmsuperman> s2013: http://jsfiddle.net/jC4JH/1/
[13:16:24] <duch_kazatel> but otherwise, delegation is your friend..  mind showing us what you've got that's making it not reasonable?
[13:16:48] <dmsuperman> s2013: you can see that the red background is coming from the a tag but the black border comes from the li, demonstrating that the whole li is effectively clickable
[13:17:06] <rhizome> it's just the repetition for each event per selector.
[13:17:48] <s2013> k thanks dmsuperman
[13:17:56] <duch_kazatel> rhizome i just showed you that you can do multiple events per selector
[13:18:40] <rhizome> thanks though, that makes sense. unspoken is that it might not be as offensive if i had named handlers. but yeah, i guess i should create those and then differentiate the events in the handler
[13:19:04] <duch_kazatel> honestly, i'd keep it all separate.  it shouldn't be too bad
[13:20:03] <rhizome> alright. starting by cleaning up handlers is probably a good path to figuring out larger issues
[13:23:03] <saml> hello
[13:23:08] <saml> i want to web scale.
[13:23:20] <saml> $('.articlepage')   gives me an array of 9 divs
[13:23:39] <saml> i want to insert an <iframe> on 4th div
[13:23:43] <saml> how do i do it?
[13:23:57] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with web scale?
[13:24:08] <saml> jquery = javascript = node.js = webscale
[13:24:13] <duch_kazatel> wut
[13:24:16] <saml> .children(':eq(3)')
[13:24:18] <duch_kazatel> they are not all equivalent
[13:24:35] <duch_kazatel> $('.articlepage').eq(3).append('<iframe />')
[13:28:15] <saml> hrm. waht I really want is to add a sibling node to $('.foo').eq(3)
[13:28:19] <BillCriswell> I really wonder how useful pagination is after the second page.
[13:28:34] <duch_kazatel> saml so you want to insertAfter()
[13:28:45] <duch_kazatel> or after()
[13:29:03] <duch_kazatel> $('.articlepage').eq(3).after('<iframe />')
[13:29:06] <saml> yup. .after()
[13:29:24] <saml> but then that <iframe> messes up css. let me fix css
[13:33:27] <saml> jquery makes me 10x developer
[13:38:14] <nerdin> i have one .click() function on a link, but the html of this link may change during the execution of the script, when i replace the html os the link the .click() function stop
[13:38:44] <nerdin> can someone help me please?
[13:38:46] <nerdin> :D
[13:41:05] <duch_kazatel> nerdin you want event delegation.
[13:41:51] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on('click', 'thelink', function() {});  where parent is an element that exists on pageload and thelink is the selector for your link.
[13:42:03] <nerdin> duch_kazatel: thanks, i'm in the docs seraching this
[13:43:08] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:37:22] <dunpeal> Hi. What's a nice plugin to render tables with sortable columns?
[14:39:50] <stlstude> Hi all. Is it necessary to set some sort of additional event listener/timer on mousedown()? I wouldn't think so but am trying to use it to toggle an element and it isn't working.
[14:41:09] <Zzaichik> A quick google search provided this http://tablesorter.com/ for sorting tables.
[14:41:38] <drej> Zzaichik:  you mean they have google on the internet now ?
[14:41:44] <drej> THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!
[14:41:50] <Zzaichik> stlstude: jsfiddle.com an example. Short answer to your question: no.
[14:42:02] <Zzaichik> drej: I know right?!
[14:42:27] <drej> stlstude: why not use .click ?
[14:45:19] <stlstude> drej i tried .on, .click, .mousedown... haha it all works in console but that's where it ends
[14:45:27] <stlstude> zzaichk attempting to fiddle-ize
[14:45:40] <drej> stlstude:  then there might be some issue with the way your invoking it or binding it
[14:45:49] <drej> if you can triger it fine with the console, then there's something up with the way youre doing that
[14:46:06] <Zzaichik> aye - gots to see some code.
[14:46:09] <benlieb> Can anyone recommend a shorter way to write this:     opts = { delay: $(el).data('delay') != undefined ? $(el).data('delay') : { show: 2000, hide: 0} }
[14:47:03] <benlieb> i originally had { delay: $(el).data('data-delay') || {show:2000,..} , but that doesn't work when the val is 0
[14:50:56] <dmsuperman> benlieb: other than copying $(el).data('delay') into its own variable to make that reference shorter (and eliminate a pointless second call) not really. not if you want to allow for 0
[14:52:20] <benlieb> dmsuperman: yeah
[14:52:41] <stlstude> zzaichik / drej - kind of a meaty fiddle but didn't want to take the time to parse through all the extraneous HTML/CSS so just left that in since i'm not touching that right now. You'll see i'm adding the 'why buy' list via jQuery and im trying to get it to go away when the 'zoom image' button is clicked and then re-appear when it's clicked again - http://jsfiddle.net/LDEbc/
[14:52:55] <dmsuperman> you could prob use extend benlieb
[14:53:20] <drej> there's so much happening
[14:54:15] <benlieb> dmsuperman: perhaps a better question is this: libraries / frameworks often allow for initializing though javascript OR through data attribs, e.g. Bootstrap. I often want to init all via javascript but have override potential for specific elements via html attributes. The only way I've found to do this is to check for those attributes at init time in the js. Is there a better more 'standard' way?
[14:55:18] <Technodrome> i have a simple question, but for some reason my complex questions get answers, my simple ones do not
[14:55:21] <dmsuperman> benlieb: many plugins I see use a defaults array, using $.extend with $.data()
[14:55:27] <dmsuperman> benlieb: let me find an example
[14:55:37] <Technodrome> i have a dom manipulation happening on page load, i want to debug it, how do I go about this?
[14:59:14] <benlieb> dmsuperman: i see what you mean. That's tricky though. https://gist.github.com/pixelterra/4b30f8962aa6e52a6fbb
[14:59:38] <benlieb> Looks like every defined property except when the value is undefined is copied.
[14:59:58] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome that's... a strange question,
[15:01:03] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: there is a jquery hide happening, and i can’t catch it
[15:02:17] <dmsuperman> benlieb: isn't that correct?
[15:02:19] <duch_kazatel> then search through your codebase.
[15:02:35] <benlieb> dmsuperman: works for me. I've never used it. Don't write much js
[15:02:39] <dmsuperman> benlieb: in reality you shouldn't really have prop: undefined, that just means prop shouldn't be defined
[15:02:52] <dmsuperman> http://jsfiddle.net/s442S/1/
[15:04:02] <benlieb> dmsuperman: I was just simulating a whitelist.
[15:04:42] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: do you ever catch dom mutations with a debugger?
[15:04:48] <benlieb> looks like el.data() gets all the data attribs. But the element can have data attribs for many purposes. It feels weird to just toss them all into the func
[15:05:04] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome sure.  that's not what you need ;)
[15:05:16] <Technodrome> it works perfectly for every other event
[15:05:29] <Technodrome> but this .hide() which is occuring on page load or what not , i can’t catch it
[15:05:40] <duch_kazatel> right - so search through your code.
[15:06:46] <benlieb> dmsuperman: what about this: https://gist.github.com/pixelterra/4b30f8962aa6e52a6fbb
[15:07:58] <Zzaichik> stlstude: what's the zoom image button? The little thumbnail?
[15:08:28] <stlstude> zzaichik..sorry, it's the last (empty) square beneath all the thumbnails
[15:09:26] <Zzaichik> stlstude: does it have to be jquery 1.6?
[15:10:38] <stlstude> zzaichik sadly, yes
[15:11:43] <Zzaichik> stlstude: http://jsfiddle.net/LDEbc/3/
[15:11:57] <dmsuperman> benlieb: indeed, the .data() approach expects all data elements to be used for this purpose. You could try data-prefix-attrib and then filter the list of .data() by those containing -prefix (and remove -prefix from the key)
[15:12:35] <dmsuperman> benlieb: that approach is nice but I'm not a fan of having to explicitly list every option
[15:12:46] <dmsuperman> they each have their merits though
[15:12:49] <stlstude> zzaichik i see, thank you. can you point me to something that explains the preventDefault thing in more detail? never really understood that
[15:13:32] <Zzaichik> well, it simply prevents the default action.  http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[15:15:15] <benlieb> dmsuperman: I'm ok with the whitelist for now. If I end up with a bunch of keys, I could always use data() and strip out all keys that are not in the default object. That's probably smarter
[15:16:01] <benlieb> dmsuperman: does jquery have a convenience method for removing keys in an object from an array of keys?
[15:16:16] <stlstude> zzaicik oops, i think i miscommunicated. i still need the default 'zoom' action to happen. I just also need it to hide the 'why buy' section
[15:16:22] <benlieb> I think underscore might.
[15:17:41] <dmsuperman> I don't think jquery does anything like that, though I find myself wanting something like it often. I wound up writing a plain javascript "diff" method when i was writing a lot of node JS but I remember it being a lot more complicated than I had liked (to account for all kinds of different data structures)
[15:17:53] <duch_kazatel> "an array of keys" huh?
[15:18:16] <dmsuperman> PHP has some nice methods for this sort of stuff, array_intersect, array_diff, etc
[15:19:05] <dmsuperman> benlieb: keys.each(function() {
[15:19:08] <dmsuperman> er woops

[15:20:14] <w00tb3ast> if I have a file upload input and console log the contents of that input when a button is clicked it shows me things like the file name and size etc. if I want to use that information in a check do I need to bind it to a variable?
[15:20:27] <Keavon> I need to add an event listener to a parent but check which child is clicked, like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12758547/jquery-click-event-on-parent-but-finding-the-child-clicked-element
[15:20:37] <Keavon> Except that child also has sub-children and I don't care about them
[15:22:02] <duch_kazatel> Keavon you need to stopImmediatePropagation() on those children then.
[15:22:36] <Keavon> duch_kazatel: Do I select all those children and use that line on them/
[15:23:31] <duch_kazatel> Keavon no.  you could either bind an event listener to all of them, or check if the element you want is a parent of the current $(this) and, if so, run that method against the event.
[15:25:58] <Keavon> I'll look into the second solution; thanks
[15:32:32] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: is that the only solution search through the code?
[15:32:33] <phinxy_> Im trying to trigger a button on a site but it uses some kind of code which distinguishes a real click from a click triggered by code
[15:32:39] <phinxy_> how would i solve this?
[15:32:49] <Technodrome> I see it being removed right before my eyes, there is no way I can hook into the load event?
[15:33:14] <phinxy_> he might use this method but i have no idea how i would pass "which" variable trough, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7635274/how-to-detect-if-a-click-is-a-mouse-click-or-triggered-by-some-code
[15:33:59] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: dom breakpoints for me only work after its been loaded
[15:34:01] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome it's going to be a helluva lot faster if you just grep through your codebase at this point.
[15:34:15] <Technodrome> i found the issue a while ago, it was tough but I did
[15:34:20] <Technodrome> but i just want to do this proof of concept
[15:34:59] <duch_kazatel> i don't know that youi can find out what javascript code caused a DOM mutation event.
[15:35:59] <Technodrome> you cna do it easily with firebug after the page has been loaded
[15:36:06] <duch_kazatel> okay then do that?
[15:36:09] <Technodrome> you just click the catch mutation button in firebug and its great
[15:36:15] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand what you're asking then.
[15:36:16] <Technodrome> but it doesn’t work for stuff thats in the page load
[15:36:19] <Technodrome> ^^
[15:36:36] <duch_kazatel> chrome might carry that stuff over
[15:36:57] <duch_kazatel> iirc there's also a caching part to all this.
[15:40:44] <dmsuperman> phinxy_: You could craft an event object which looks like a real click event and pass that manually
[15:41:32] <dmsuperman> phinxy_: probably useful data here: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[15:41:32] <duch_kazatel> you could also triggerHandler() iirc
[15:50:26] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: i still can’t get it blah
[15:50:42] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: i’m glad i found it but it was by luck, it was some very verbose Drupal boilerplate
[15:59:03] <DaveOfWest> I realize this is probably a purely CSS question, but I cant find a channel for that. Can someone tell help me here: http://jsfiddle.net/4zPj2/
[15:59:55] <DaveOfWest> I want the red "this is where everything happens" div to stay within the #content div
[16:52:22] <jeffreylevesque> Could someone assist me initialize a js object?
[16:52:29] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ jeffreylevesque
[16:52:29] <b-ot> jeffreylevesque: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:52:30] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:53:26] <jeffreylevesque> I'm trying to initialize a websocket object  (https://github.com/jeff1evesque/whisper/blob/master/src/js/initializer.js)
[16:54:17] <duch_kazatel> okay.  where are you getting stuck?
[16:54:45] <Tomashe> hey guys
[16:54:57] <Tomashe>  i need recommandation for lightweight good responsive framework
[16:55:32] <duch_kazatel> for websites?
[16:55:56] <duch_kazatel> just CSS?  or...?
[16:56:33] <jeffreylevesque> I'd like my javascript to use HTML5 to access audio, and send it to the websocket - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/whisper/tree/master/websocket
[17:07:39] <Tomashe> yes just css
[17:08:01] <duch_kazatel> lots of choices.  you could just use the CSS out of bootstrap.
[17:08:08] <duch_kazatel> or just the css grid even.
[17:12:14] <Tomashe> ok bro
[17:28:21] <hooligan123> hmz people shouldnt write code that ommits the event parameter from event callback functions .. it blinds beginers to the bigger picture.. then you end up with forums worth of people rewritting the whole of jquery to hide a parent div on mouseout.. when the real simple 1 line of code solution is just check the target id is the id of the parent div
[17:29:09] <duch_kazatel> sure they should - why should i declare a variable that never gets used?
[17:29:45] <hooligan123> from a educational stand point thats just the R word
[17:30:00] <duch_kazatel> i don't write code to educate anybody.
[17:30:13] <duch_kazatel> unless i'm trying to explain something to them, at least.
[17:30:20] <hooligan123> good for you nillons other do
[17:30:36] <duch_kazatel> why would you declare a variable that never gets used?
[17:34:01] <gooddesignusa> Is it not possible to set a input value to something like &#xf002; with jquery?
[17:34:17] <gooddesignusa> It just prints it as text instead of using the font from font awesome
[17:38:17] <hooligan123> well I just cant believe some of the advise this guy just got given and had he of been made aware or taught about the event parameter he would at least not had his time wasted
[17:38:18] <gooddesignusa> Nevermind I found the solution on google. In case anyone would like to know $('.google-cse .form-submit').prop('value',$("<div>").html("&#xf002;").text());
[17:39:23] <hooligan123> winds me up i waste my time reading about them wasting theres
[17:39:24] <hooligan123> fk that
[17:39:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:39:45] <duch_kazatel> so your solution is to write bad code?
[17:40:02] <hooligan123> bruv blow it up your ass mate
[17:40:06] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:40:10] <hooligan123> im not in your fucking muggy pissing match ok?
[17:40:12] <duch_kazatel> what are you so mad at me about?
[17:40:23] <duch_kazatel> this isn't about a pissing match.  it's about not writing bad code.
[17:40:29] <duch_kazatel> ]it's not a personal thing at all.
[17:40:35] <hooligan123> what tue fk you talking about
[17:40:49] <duch_kazatel> i could ask you the same thing at this point.
[17:40:53] <hooligan123> using a function paramter is bad code now?
[17:40:58] <duch_kazatel> " hmz people shouldnt write code that ommits the event parameter from event callback functions"
[17:41:05] <duch_kazatel> if you're not using the event object, why include it?
[17:41:10] <duch_kazatel> if you're using it, include it.
[17:41:42] <hooligan123> its just to help people along in tutorials
[17:41:59] <ryanneufeld> hooligan123: it's common to exclude un-used params in JS
[17:42:08] <hooligan123> i see 1000's of tutorials ommit it all the time .. I myself lived in the dark not understanding it for many a month
[17:42:09] <ryanneufeld> especially with jquery functions
[17:42:40] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/ this talks about the event object.
[17:44:48] <ryanneufeld> hooligan123: FYI, it's considered bad practice to declare variables you're not going to use. In any programming language
[17:45:04] <hooligan123> oh jesus christ
[17:45:07] <hooligan123> get a fucking grip
[17:45:15] <ryanneufeld> hooligan123: watch it
[17:45:37] <ryanneufeld> being belligerent isn't acceptable
[17:46:51] <duch_kazatel> hooligan123 why are you being so hostile?
[17:53:18] <hooligan123> Im was not being hostile until you started to infer to me that by defining a function parameter in the context of educating Others that I have some how advocated bad programing habbits and or have bad programming habbits my self like I am some type of school boy.. after seeing that double/trebble shit storm created on stackoverflow by a person simpley not knowing about the eventObject ..
[17:54:32] <ryanneufeld> hooligan123: how is "get a fucking grip" not hostile?
[17:55:13] <ryanneufeld> You brought up your point for discussion, and proceeded to swear at the only person here who took the time to talk to you
[17:55:25] <vinex08> hi, im looking for an effect "dropdown select"  e.g  i choose PAGE 1 then page 1 will come out.. fade or slide
[17:55:47] <vinex08> im not sure what its called
[17:55:50] <hooligan123>  No you both proceeded to chat shit to me and totaly forgot what you had read like 10 seconds before that
[17:56:18] <ryanneufeld> if you only want people to agree with you hooligan123, this isn't the place to be. I read the entire conversation before I weighed in
[17:56:34] <ryanneufeld> vinex08: your question is rather vague
[17:57:02] <ryanneufeld> vinex08: are you looking to load each page in via ajax? or something like a carousel or slider?
[17:59:54] <duch_kazatel> well that was a fun evening.
[18:00:33] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:00:35] <duch_kazatel> for the record, i never mean to be offensive tbh.
[18:01:18] <ryanneufeld> I saw someone bring up a thought, and that thought responded to. It's an open forum.
[18:01:33] <hooligan123> for the record 1000's of poor souls have rewrritten .mouseleave poorly
[18:02:10] <vinex08> <@ryanneufeld> vinex08: are you looking to load each page in via ajax?  <-- yeah i guess this is what im looking for ..
[18:02:12] <ryanneufeld> hooligan123: What exactly are you attempting to accomplish here? I'm sensing some frustration
[18:02:14] <vinex08> any examples?
[18:02:19] <ryanneufeld> vinex08: google dude
[18:02:29] <ryanneufeld> or dudette if that's appropriate
[18:03:02] <vinex08> google what?
[18:04:24] <ryanneufeld> vinex08: http://bit.ly/1nKCZ1b
[18:09:10] <hooligan123> no i accomplished what I need too tnx ... which was just that whole how to cleanly slideout/close a div with child elements... and im sorry for snaping at you ;/ i just get frustrated at times so much time gets wasted
[18:10:24] <ryanneufeld> hooligan123: we all get frustrated, and this channel is here to help. Sometimes taking a deep breath, or a step away, can help. Trust me, I used to put holes in the walls :S
[18:10:38] <ryanneufeld> and if you're nice, people want to help you
[18:10:41] <ryanneufeld> :)
[18:10:48] <ryanneufeld> no hard feelings hooligan123
[18:18:07] <vinex08> thanks!
[19:05:59] <adamsilver> how do i get a div complete code, not just its contents
[19:06:18] <BillCriswell> adamsilver: $div[0].outerHTML
[19:07:07] <BillCriswell> adamsilver: So like $('#divID')[0].outerHTML
[19:07:16] <BillCriswell> I love meetups.
[19:09:03] <adamsilver> BillCriswell: perfect, it worked. thanks
[19:09:15] <BillCriswell> adamsilver: No problemoooo
[19:16:21] <woodoo> guys i'm not getting it to work: http://dpaste.com/15T7V5X
[19:16:39] <woodoo> it is not inserting anything after my inputs
[19:16:54] <woodoo> and i'm sure the inputs with name=key exist
[19:17:11] <woodoo> i logged what that "find" method returned and it is an object..
[19:18:28] <yanger> ok. user enters in=123. in var a=[111,222,333,123,223,112,331]; how would i figure out which array had 123 (in this instance, 123 is a[4], right?
[19:18:46] <BillCriswell> woodoo: `this` probably isn't what you think it is in the done callback.
[19:18:54] <yanger> er.. whoops. sounds like a javascript question now..
[19:19:13] <woodoo> oh BillCriswell, so `this` changes? :(
[19:19:28] <woodoo> i'll try to save a variable with this in the beggining, just a sec
[19:19:28] <BillCriswell> yanger: $.inArray would return the index of the 123.
[19:19:43] <BillCriswell> woodoo: All the time. Yes, save it at the start.
[19:19:50] <yanger> inArray :D cool
[19:20:13] <BillCriswell> yanger: $.inArray(123, [1,2,3,123]) would return 4.
[19:20:57] <woodoo> BillCriswell could you tell me what's the difference between .after and .insertAfter?
[19:21:54] <woodoo> by the way, now it says `name=password` (unrecognized expression)
[19:22:12] <BillCriswell> woodoo: They're pretty close, just the order of them is switched.
[19:23:10] <BillCriswell> $el.insertAfter($someOtherElement) vs $somethingOtherElement.after($el);
[19:26:38] <BillCriswell> woodoo: Totally unrelated error.
[19:27:28] <woodoo> if i .find() in a form element with 'name="some_name"' wouldn't that wokr?
[19:27:30] <woodoo> work*
[19:28:18] <BillCriswell> woodoo: $form.find('[name="some_name"]') ?
[19:29:42] <uskerine> BillCriswell, just fyi, doing the JQuery .load and .addClass stuff we were discussing the other day to embbed NAV html blocks in several html files  seems to mess up with the  .js menu code, so I finally programmed a manual linux script to replace <!-- INSERTFILE myFile.html --> with myFile.html contents. It it not very elegant but it works.
[19:30:18] <BillCriswell> uskerine: How did you do that? I thought you weren't using Java.
[19:31:01] <uskerine> I am using Java
[19:31:09] <uskerine> but the small script is written in BASH and AWK
[19:31:21] <woodoo> thanks, BillCriswell! It works now.
[19:31:30] <BillCriswell> woodoo: Sweeeeet.
[19:31:41] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Good times.
[19:31:44] <uskerine> so I code everything in files like 0myHtml.html, and then the script reads them and looks for INSERTFILE tags
[19:31:54] <BillCriswell> uskerine: JEkyll would give you those kinds of abilities plus a lot more.
[19:31:56] <uskerine> then generates myFile.html
[19:32:02] <uskerine> Yeah, I was checking that
[19:32:30] <uskerine> but I thought that it would be faster to do a small script, right now I only miss that functionality
[19:32:42] <uskerine> I also want to check mixture.io following your suggestion
[19:32:48] <uskerine> I definitively need some front-end automation
[19:35:43] <BillCriswell> Yeah, both are great.
[19:36:40] <BillCriswell> Mixture is good if you don't feel liek fucking with the command line.
[19:37:32] <uskerine> My only concern with those is the time needed to invest to learn how to use them
[19:37:59] <uskerine> I am fine with command line
[19:40:47] <BillCriswell> They're both relatively easy to pick up. I like mixtures ability to host things online very easily.
[19:41:02] <BillCriswell> Though, that one does cost a little money
[19:41:11] <uskerine> well I was checking it is not too much
[19:41:19] <uskerine> I still can pay 38 USD
[19:45:58] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[20:04:27] <hooligan123> does jquery have a better textarea option with some controls for writing emails perhaps?
[20:07:45] <hooligan123> ah sweetness
[20:07:55] <hooligan123> just saw jquert TE
[20:11:31] <rhizome> i'm thinking i want to enforce the state of a form when its ajax submission succeeds, how can i ensure a checkbox is checked? i can't find any reference to checking an unchecked box.
[20:12:46] <systemfault> rhizome: You select it with jQuery you .prop('checked', true); on it
[20:16:37] <yanger> thanks!
[20:23:02] <rhizome> systemfault: nice one, thanks
[20:31:32] <uskerine> how do I select the <a> element when you have #new_quote selector? http://pastebin.com/psDKez8S
[20:33:02] <tw2113> $('#quotes a')
[20:33:13] <tw2113> oops, misread
[20:33:27] <tw2113> $('#new_quote a')
[20:37:36] <vinex08> that will target all a inside #new_quote ryt?
[20:39:02] <uskerine> yeah
[20:39:17] <uskerine> and the a is a child of the new_quote's parent
[22:26:54] <sammych> what's the best way to get flexible elements take up remaining horizontal space next to fixed width elements?
[22:27:18] <sammych> [ ............. ][ 30px ][ 30px ]
[22:27:59] <sammych> I've been using display:table/cell and setting the cells to 1px wide
[22:28:07] <sammych> should I be using flex?
[22:32:19] <Yahkob_> how could I increment pixels on a class if the style is declared in the actual tag
[22:32:37] <Yahkob_> <div class="someclass" style="left: 20px"></div>
[22:32:51] <Yahkob_> selecting left property shows up with the wrong element
[22:33:12] <Yahkob_> hah
[22:33:15] <Yahkob_> answered my question
[22:33:16] <Yahkob_> sorry
[22:53:03] <sammych> my tabs aren't switching content. It's like it doesn't even know those tabs are there
[22:53:21] <sammych> the ids match, and the same HTML works in a fiffle
[22:53:25] <sammych> fiddle*
[22:58:17] <Blaster> If you have a variable with a reference to an element, is there a way to reattach that variable to the element after using AJAX to reload the fragment of the page containing that element?
[23:14:36] <jop008> I swithc to 1.4.3 today but the layout is ruined

[23:35:59] <jop008> Anyone using jqmobile 1.4.3?
[23:55:51] <onats> hey guys, is datatables 1.10 totally different from previous versions, meaning my old code won’t be compatible?
