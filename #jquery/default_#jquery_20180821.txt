[00:09:38] <Lenswipee> Hi, http://jsfiddle.net/npb61x3d/25/ <--- My set interval function continues to run after dialog is destroyed
[00:12:52] <pavonia> Yes, why would it be removed? It completely unconnected to the dialog
[00:17:54] <Lenswipee> pavonia: Right. How do I connect it to the dialog?
[00:19:25] <pavonia> You could clear the interval when the dialog is destroyed
[00:20:04] <Lenswipee> pavonia: how?
[00:20:39] <Lenswipee> pavonia: wouldn't it be simpler to link the interval function to the dialog?
[00:21:14] <pavonia> Link in what way?
[00:22:11] <Lenswipee> pavonia: well connect the function to the dialog so when its destroyed the fuction gets destroyed
[00:23:04] <Lenswipee> pavonia: well the dialog objects get destroyed so the interval function will stop i mean
[00:24:23] <pavonia> When the object gets destroyed that doesn't mean all of its components get destroyed too if they are referenced by another object
[00:25:03] <pavonia> You could also use setTimeout and check if the dialog is still there in the handler
[00:26:06] <Lenswipee> pavonia: how?
[00:26:32] <Lenswipee> pavonia: in my case the object is not referenced by other objects
[00:26:43] <pavonia> if ($dlg) setTimeout(..); or something
[00:27:49] <Lenswipee> pavonia: you mean setInterval?
[00:27:55] <pavonia> No
[00:28:22] <Lenswipee> pavonia: I'm using setInterval() not setTimeout
[00:30:15] <pavonia> Well, that's your problem ;) You have two options: use setInterval once and stop it eventually, or use setTimeout repeatedly until a certain predicate is satisfied (= the dialog is gone)
[00:31:18] <jonez> greetings. I just did a drop-in replacement of jquery 3.1.1 with jquery 3.3.x. some things are broken, including "jQuery does not exist" and also an error about "$" being undefined. need help :)
[00:32:14] <Lenswipee> pavonia: ummm....using setTimeout() repeatedly is basically a setInterval(). Problem still remains how to stop either when dialog is gone
[00:32:39] <Lenswipee> Hi, http://jsfiddle.net/npb61x3d/25/ <--- My set interval function continues to run after dialog is destroyed
[00:33:31] <pavonia> Lenswipee: I just explained that you have to check for the dialog still being there in the setTimeout version
[00:33:33] <Lenswipee> jonez: you help me then I help you because I was here before you :-)
[00:34:55] <pavonia> jonez: Are you sure you don't run jQuery code before the JS is loaded?
[00:36:24] <Lenswipee> pavonia: http://jsfiddle.net/npb61x3d/27/ <-- updated no go
[00:38:00] <pavonia> You have to check inside the handler and have to use setTimeout, not setInterval
[00:38:14] <jonez> pavonia, I load jquery as an async, and the dependencies as defer
[00:38:54] <Lenswipee> pavonia: which handler?
[00:39:04] <pavonia> The interval handler
[00:39:24] <pavonia> or timeout rather
[00:40:41] <pavonia> Lenswipee: Start a handler that fires exactly once. When it fires do your handling and check if the dialog is still there. If it still exists, run another handler, otherwise just quit
[00:41:17] <pavonia> Or use setInterval/clearInterval which is certainly easier to implement
[00:41:46] <Lenswipee> pavonia: i like the setInterval/clearInterval
[00:41:53] <Lenswipee> pavonia: how i do that one?
[00:42:38] <pavonia> Err, what is unclear about that?
[00:45:02] <Lenswipee> pavonia: http://jsfiddle.net/npb61x3d/33/ <-- fixed it...seems to work without clearInterval
[00:47:36] <pavonia> Isn't that the same as in your first version?
[00:48:04] <Lenswipee> pavonia: no, because this one works
[00:51:19] <pavonia> Hhm, interesting
[00:52:23] <Lenswipee> pavonia: lol you amateur at jquery like me, that's ok bro :-)
[00:52:27] <pavonia> Lenswipee: Oh, I see. You do not actually cancel the handler, it keeps running just does nothing visible anymore
[00:54:59] <Lenswipee> pavonia: you gave me the tip and realised i put the check at the wrong place and should be in the handler.
[00:56:06] <pavonia> Note that this is bad style as the handler still keeps running in the background
[00:57:40] <Lenswipee> pavonia: yeah it's terrible i actually prefer a version that clears the setInterval() when dialog is closed. no idea how to do it
[01:05:31] <Lenswipee> pavonia: http://jsfiddle.net/npb61x3d/38/ <-- fixed properly
[01:06:51] <Lenswipee> pavonia: thanks for your tips
[01:08:02] <pavonia> No problem
[01:40:20] <mm_> my jquery has stopped working
[01:43:47] <Woet> mm_: thanks for sharing

[04:52:55] <Ontaine> Hello, I am sending JSON data with an HTTP-request from an Arduino to webserver. I want to grab this JSON data with JS (or jQuery) and show it on the website. And this is the part i am getting confused. Do i need to save the JSON data in a text file and do a AJAX request to get the data in my browser? I have already established a connection between the Arduino and the local webserver. I can send the data from the Ardu
[04:52:56] <Ontaine> ino to the webserver with an HHTP request.
[04:53:22] <Ontaine> Thank you!
[04:54:03] <Cork> Ontaine: you send it from an arduion TO a webserver??
[04:54:22] <Cork> did you mean THROUGH a webserver?
[04:54:37] <Cork> or are you talking about a post storing it in a database?
[04:54:57] <Ontaine> The arduino is the client now and sends a post request to my local webserver
[04:55:06] <Ontaine> with json data
[04:55:14] <Cork> ok and what are you doing with that data?
[04:56:11] <Ontaine> now nothing :) I want to show the data in my browser. But i am confused now. Do i need to save the data in a database and encode it as a JSON to make it accessible in my browser.
[04:56:19] <Ontaine> Really confused :D
[04:56:33] <Cork> you can't save it in the browser if it is pushed to the webserver
[04:56:46] <Ontaine> In a database?
[04:56:51] <Cork> for example ya
[04:57:07] <Cork> or you have to pull for the data from the browser and proxy the request in the webserver to the arduino
[04:57:24] <Ontaine> Hmm ok ok..
[04:57:25] <Cork> but that might be slow
[05:00:20] <Ontaine> I think i am explained it wrong. I have send data (led=on&ledId=6) from Arduino to a PHP file. and i can see the data in my serial monitor. I want to convert this post to JSON and show the data in my browser. But i can not access the data in my browser because Arduino (the client requested the information and not my browser)
[05:00:37] <Ontaine> this is a mix question of JSON, JS and PHP
[05:01:13] <Ontaine> So i want to do an AJAX call to get the JSON data and show it on my website
[05:01:49] <Ontaine> a little bit hard to explain, sorry for the confusion.
[05:02:46] <pavonia> I'm even more confused now than before :D
[05:03:10] <Ontaine> ahah :(
[05:03:18] <Ontaine> I understand :P
[05:05:46] <Ontaine> let me recap. I am sending data from Arduino (client) to a PHP file (this file is on my local webserver). I want to convert this post to a json file and show the JSON data on my website that is hosted on my local webserver. I want to use an AJAX call to get the JSON data.
[05:06:51] <Cork> Ontaine: yes, it is the same thing you explained before
[05:07:10] <Cork> the reason you have problem is cause the arduino is posting the data to a webserver
[05:07:16] <Ontaine> yes!!
[05:07:19] <Cork> it means it comes as a separate request to the server
[05:07:27] <Ontaine> yes!
[05:07:31] <Cork> then a browser makes a separate request to the webserver
[05:07:44] <Cork> but as those are two separate requests there are no sain way to get data from one to the other
[05:07:56] <Cork> and that is why you have to do one of two things
[05:08:20] <Cork> 1. make the webserver proxy the request and instead of the arduino pushing it, have the server request it
[05:08:36] <Cork> OR 2. have the data stored in a way that the webserver can access on requests
[05:08:53] <Cork> be it a database, a file on disk
[05:09:14] <Cork> but it needs to be stored so it can be randomly accessed by the webserver for option 2 to work
[05:09:23] <Ontaine> So i thought to save the http request in a database and convert it to JSON. So, that i can make an AJAX call to that file.
[05:09:34] <Ontaine> @Cork, thank you!
[05:09:55] <Ontaine> I was really confused and didn't know what a good solution was/is.

[08:45:36] <emx> i have the following message when i make a request to an endpoint that is oauth2 protected:
[08:45:37] <emx> Strict-Transport-Security: The connection to the site is untrustworthy, so the specified header was ignored.
[08:46:10] <Cork> the site is http, it needs to be https
[08:46:12] <emx> as a consequence (i assume that) the authorization header is stripped from the request header and the endpoint can't authenticate.
[08:46:21] <Destramic> ive just looked at adding google maps to my website but its rather pricey...is there any alternative that you know of please guys?
[08:46:45] <emx> Cork, the webpage i enter into the browser is https and the ajax request that is made is also https.
[08:46:46] <Cork> Destramic: google maps is free, as long as you don't want an unbranded version
[08:47:15] <Cork> emx: then a script or something is loaded over http
[08:47:25] <Cork> cause that is what the message means
[08:47:40] <Cork> check your network tab in the browser
[08:48:33] <emx> Cork, hm... all the relevant scripts are loaded using https... :-/
[08:48:53] <Cork> emx: do you have any requests in the network tab that isn't https?
[08:49:17] <Cork> depending on how strict the policy is that might be enough
[08:49:22] <emx> Cork, no (assuming that the green locks next to the domain names denote https)
[08:49:40] <Cork> hmm, weird...
[08:49:55] <Cork> might be an extension messing with things then...
[08:50:27] <emx> the response contains "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains"
[08:50:35] <emx> but that wouldn't interfere, would it?
[08:50:53] <Destramic> Cork: do you have a link please?...everything ive seen needs an api
[08:50:58] <Destramic> thank you
[08:51:14] <Cork> Destramic: should be in the normal google maps api page
[08:51:39] <Cork> emx: that isn't the full policy
[08:52:45] <Cork> emx: ah, wait transport security, that is what forces https...
[08:52:54] <emx> yes
[08:52:56] <Cork> so you have a request that is http and you're blocking it >_<
[08:53:05] <Cork> that is what that message means
[08:53:17] * Cork afk
[08:53:36] <emx> there is no http request X(..............

[09:16:39] <Inazad> there is a way to show a progress while the form is submitting ?
[09:19:43] <Inazad> someone here
[09:25:26] <Cork> Inazad: not if it is a normal form post
[09:25:32] <Cork> if it is ajax then yes
[09:40:54] <Inazad> Cork, there is a way to replace the <li> element "POST" to a loading GIF image ?
[09:41:14] <Cork> li post??
[09:41:25] <Inazad> I dont want to know the progression, I want to display to the user that the form is processing  and prevent it from double click
[09:41:26] <Cork> li is html markup it can't do posts...
[09:41:44] <Inazad> Cork, I'm gonna show you the snipset
[09:41:51] <Cork> ya, and that was what i was answering you about
[09:42:34] <Inazad> Cork, https://pastebin.com/raw/Sdp6LtR2
[09:42:55] <Inazad> I want to change the <li> value or replace it by "Processing ..." but itsn't working
[09:43:19] <Cork> ya, so you're doing a full page post, and then no the page stops rendering and you can't do anything to show progress
[09:43:28] <Cork> you can disable the submit button though
[09:43:52] <Cork> ah, no
[09:44:02] <Cork> you're using a click event handler instead of a form submit
[09:44:13] <Inazad> cause its a jquery step (wizard)
[09:44:20] <Cork> doesn't matter
[09:44:28] <Cork> btw attr(
[09:44:41] <Cork> btw attr('disabled', true) won't do what you think it does
[09:44:53] <Cork> you want .prop('disabled', true)
[09:45:04] <Inazad> Cork, this "$('#w4').find('ul.pager li.finish').val( 'Publishing ...' ).attr('disabled', true);" do not work... the text stays at "Publish"
[09:45:29] <Cork> is the click handler fireing at all?
[09:45:40] <Inazad> the form is submitting yes
[09:45:53] <Cork> not what i asked...
[09:46:02] <Cork> javascript isn't needed to submit a form
[09:46:49] <Inazad> when we are at the step #1, I think the previous button got the class "disabled"
[09:47:17] <Inazad> so how I add the class disabled to the finish button and then change the text in the <li> ?
[09:48:27] <Cork> Inazad: you have to firstly make sure the click event fires
[09:48:35] <AdamPDotty> $('button.finish').addClass('disabled');
[09:48:47] <Cork> then make sure the selector finds the target element
[09:49:06] <Cork> and thirdly make sure javascript is still executing at this point, as it is a full form post
[09:49:19] <Inazad> Cork, if the form is submitting via document.getElementById('...').submit(); then the event its fired ?
[09:49:46] <Cork> Inazad: IF that is what causes it ya, but it can be just a submit in the form
[09:50:10] <Cork> you're assuming a lot here and that makes for very chaky grounds to base debuggin on
[09:51:28] <Inazad> if the li got an ID
[09:51:38] <Inazad> can I use document.getElementById
[09:52:47] <Cork> sure
[10:07:34] <Inazad> Cork, so how I change the <a>Publish</a>  text in the LI ?
[10:07:38] <Inazad> and how to disable it ?
[10:07:44] <Cork> you can't
[10:07:55] <Inazad> so the user coulb click n times ?
[10:08:13] <Cork> its a click handler on a none form element
[10:08:20] <Cork> only way to disable it is to remove the click handler
[10:08:44] <Cork> or to check in the handler if you have something set (class, variable or similar)
[10:10:13] <Inazad> Cork the li has a class
[10:10:17] <Inazad> class "finish"
[10:10:55] <Cork> no that always exist, it isn't something you can check for if the handler has fired once
[10:17:37] <Inazad> so how I fix my problem ?

[11:53:54] <kevindank> Hello, im trying to implement paroller.js on http://dev2.heliosipm.com/services/systems-and-data.html  i've added jquery.min, and the script and tried to make the hero section use the effect but its not working
[11:54:05] <kevindank> it should be doing a parralax scroll where the orange background and computer graphic is
[11:54:13] <kevindank> hoping someone can point out what i did wrong
[11:57:26] <robertmaxrees> kevindank where's your code to init it?
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> kevindank also: https://tgomilar.github.io/paroller.js/#usage
[11:59:53] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's more than just "call .paroller()
[12:00:53] <kevindank> https://pastebin.com/0AH81H73
[12:02:10] <kevindank> im mostly just a css/html person so forgive me.    Im trying to implement the Flower background example seen here:https://tgomilar.github.io/paroller.js/#usage
[12:02:30] <kevindank> so i added the html to the page and then created a js file called pa.js
[12:02:55] <kevindank> instead of calling it jumbotron i named it my-paroller
[12:04:18] <robertmaxrees> kevindank so did you read the docs I just linked?
[12:04:27] <robertmaxrees> because they show you what all you need to do.
[12:05:00] <kevindank> hey robert, yes thats where i was originally and tried to use the code displayed under the flower example to do it
[12:06:12] <robertmaxrees> but the code in your js file just does .paroller()
[12:06:48] <robertmaxrees> aah nvm nvm
[12:07:23] <kevindank> sorry about that, i may not have had the most recent versin installed
[12:07:36] <kevindank> if you refresh now, you will see it but it looks off...you can only see a portion of the picture
[12:07:46] <robertmaxrees> i might also fix your html.
[12:08:01] <robertmaxrees> ah, looks like you just did :)
[12:08:42] <kevindank> Yep, now im just trying to figure out how to bring the computer graphic up?
[12:10:47] <kevindank> ideally you would be able to see 3/4 of the graphic
[12:11:12] <kapil___> Hello I want to start using jquery. I am a react developer. Which framework should I use.?
[12:11:37] <robertmaxrees> kevindank so maybe #css? :)
[12:11:41] <robertmaxrees> kapil___ huh?
[12:12:01] <robertmaxrees> kapil___ you don't need any framework to use jquery.
[12:12:05] <kapil___> should i use jquery ui, or kendo ui core?
[12:12:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:12:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't need either.
[12:12:34] <taplar_lunch> kapil___: are you intending to continue using react?
[12:12:47] <kapil___> thanks,  i am a react developer.
[12:13:20] <kapil___> but i want to move to jquery again after some years
[12:13:45] <kapil___> taplar_lunch: no
[12:14:01] <taplar_lunch> k
[12:14:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:14:16] <robertmaxrees> i am so confused lol
[12:14:23] <robertmaxrees> you don't "move to" jquery
[12:14:28] <taplar_lunch> i was checking to see if he was going to stick jquery into a react project
[12:14:41] <taplar_lunch> and "why", :)
[12:15:29] <kapil___> i see that jquery is very fast, while react becomes slow when my forms getting bigger.
[12:15:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:15:40] <robertmaxrees> apples and oranges.
[12:15:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery and react do two different jobs.
[12:16:42] <kapil___> i need some components for forms. which jquery based libray should i use?
[12:16:50] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[12:17:06] <robertmaxrees> if you're in a react app, just use react.
[12:17:35] <kapil___> robertmaxrees: thanks. i will use pure input element thanks.
[12:18:26] <kapil___> no i not want to use react app. i have very struggle with it
[12:19:24] <taplar_lunch> have you asked around any react rooms to see if you could identify any of your performance issues?
[12:19:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:20:09] <kapil___> taplar_lunch: i have very big nested forms.
[12:20:45] <kapil___> i will try to ask in react room
[12:21:25] <taplar_lunch> i would encourage you to at least try to identify the performance issues, before you drop the framework completely.
[12:21:35] <robertmaxrees> kapil___ when you say "nested forms", you don't mean you have <form> inside of <form>, right?
[12:21:50] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, what taplar_lunch said - react is known to be very fast.
[12:24:31] <kapil___> robertmaxrees: oh thanks for hope. i try to ask in react rooms.
[14:19:36] <how2hack> hi, i've got a little problem, i have tabbed content, what i do is use transformx to move tabs outside the viewport, it's working ok, the problem is when i press the tab key, the input elements get focused and the whole page is moved to the left, breaking the page completely, what can i do to prevent this from happening? any way to easily "disable" those tabs (elements) so that nothing inside them can get focus when they have translatex?
[14:20:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:20:37] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what't going on?
[14:20:40] <robertmaxrees> *what's
[14:22:38] <how2hack> yes, it's very simple, i've got a section with many articles (tabs), only one of this articles is visible at a time, the rest have a class that hides them, the problem is some one them have focusable elements and when they get focus the parent article is pushed into the viewport, moving the whole body to the other side
[14:22:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:22:54] <how2hack> should i still make a fiddle?
[14:22:59] <robertmaxrees> that would be amazing.
[14:23:06] <robertmaxrees> i can't see the code otherwise :)
[14:23:31] <how2hack> ok i'm gonna try to reproduce it, it should be easy
[14:30:46] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/9hya7g6x/
[14:30:53] <how2hack> just press tab and it will happen
[14:31:34] <how2hack> the relevant css is at the end
[14:34:33] <how2hack> and https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/9hya7g6x/1/ the click handler to navigate the (missing) tabs
[14:37:13] <how2hack> what do you think? is it better to try and find a css solution? or maybe there isn't, it can only be fixed using scripts?
[15:15:42] <kevindank> Hello, on the site http://dev2.heliosipm.com/services/systems-and-data.html  i added paroller.js to create the parallax effect in the hero image/orange.   After adding it i cannot see my h1 tag unless i tweak the screen size
[15:15:54] <kevindank> I've tried #css but am being told it may be a js issue
[15:17:29] <taplar> i'm not familiar with this plugin.  have you reviewed https://github.com/tgomilar/paroller.js to see the available options for the plugin?
[15:19:35] <kevindank> tapler: yes, i have, i dont see anything indicating this particular issue
[15:19:41] <kevindank> nor do i see a support address
[15:20:02] <taplar> support address?
[15:20:24] <taplar> you mean to ask for help from the author?
[15:20:29] <kevindank> email address or avenue for support from the author
[15:20:45] <taplar> You could sumbit an Issue with the Issues tab on that github
[15:27:17] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaaa
[16:11:05] <how2hack> robertmaxrees: hey, you got disconnected and didn't see my messages, you mind checking it now?
[16:11:46] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i left :)
[16:11:51] <robertmaxrees> whatcha got?
[16:12:01] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/9hya7g6x/1/
[16:12:12] <how2hack> just tab inside the iframe
[16:12:15] <robertmaxrees> :|
[16:12:38] <robertmaxrees> what does the markup actually look like
[16:12:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:13:22] <robertmaxrees> not seeing how to replicate this but using this.
[16:13:43] <how2hack> the articles' content is not relevant, the problem is the whole article's input getting focus and the article pushes the whole body to the left
[16:14:00] <how2hack> or is it just my browser?
[16:14:03] <robertmaxrees> so using this, how do I replicate the bug?
[16:14:53] <how2hack> a section with two articles, the second one with transform translateX(100%) and an input
[16:15:11] <robertmaxrees> lemme rephrase - what do I need to click to make the bug happen?
[16:15:13] <how2hack> yea i could've done just that
[16:15:29] <how2hack> click the dom, press tab many times
[16:16:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm sorry, i'm lost heh.
[16:17:10] <how2hack> did you see it? i can make a gif
[16:17:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what tabbing through inputs as to do with clicking on things.
[16:18:49] <how2hack> no, the problem is not clicking, i said click the dom so you don't have to tab all the way trough jsfiddle dom to the actual fiddle dom (iframe)
[16:20:30] <robertmaxrees> i must have gotten your issue mixed up with something else.
[16:20:36] <robertmaxrees> sorry.  went through the logs again.
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> so you want to prevent elements from getting focus?
[16:20:54] <how2hack> well, i'd like to now if is it expected for the browser to do that?
[16:21:12] <how2hack> push the whole body to the side to show the hidden element?
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  the browser moves when an element gets focus.
[16:21:44] <robertmaxrees> it's generally advisable to not use transforms like that to hide content when possible.
[16:22:07] <how2hack> what should i use instead?
[16:22:41] <robertmaxrees> toggle visibility or display
[16:22:51] <robertmaxrees> that'll at least prevent the page from shifting.
[16:23:07] <how2hack> so it's not possible to make the tabs change with a moving animation?
[16:23:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:23:31] <robertmaxrees> you mean tab through the tabs on the page?
[16:23:43] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, but you'd then need to manage the tabindex
[16:23:45] <how2hack> yes, show the clicked tab and hide the current one
[16:23:55] <how2hack> with an animation like transform
[16:24:15] <robertmaxrees> that will also make your page all but unusable by certain users.
[16:24:57] <how2hack> you mean transform is not supported on some browsers?
[16:25:11] <how2hack> then i can use some jquery method
[16:25:12] <robertmaxrees> no
[16:25:18] <robertmaxrees> i mean blind users
[16:25:57] <robertmaxrees> because they effectively tab through the page.
[16:25:57] <robertmaxrees> which may/may not be what you want.
[16:25:57] <robertmaxrees> up to you.
[16:26:24] <how2hack> then i should add display none after the animation?
[16:26:37] <robertmaxrees> back up - why are you positining things outside of the viewport?
[16:26:44] <robertmaxrees> i have a feeling i'm missing some context here.
[16:27:01] <how2hack> no reason at all, just to hide the tabs
[16:27:12] <how2hack> to have the moving animation
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> ^ so there is a reason.
[16:27:31] <robertmaxrees> are you positioning them that way so they can animate in somehow?
[16:27:41] <robertmaxrees> sorry, since i don't have a full test case, I have no idea what's up.
[16:28:18] <how2hack> it's just a content page organized with tabs
[16:28:40] <robertmaxrees> you keep mentioning animations/transitions, etc.
[16:28:50] <robertmaxrees> not sure if it's some kind of psuedo carousel or something.
[16:29:21] <how2hack> just give the tabs transition some life
[16:29:34] <robertmaxrees> so
[16:29:40] <robertmaxrees> how are you moving them offscreen right now?
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't swap that code with a simple .addClass('hide'); ?
[16:30:23] <how2hack> that's what i'm actually doing
[16:30:30] <how2hack> line 12
[16:30:33] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/9hya7g6x/1/
[16:31:19] <robertmaxrees> >.> so then where's the confusion?
[16:31:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/9hya7g6x/7/ then just addClass/removeClass.
[16:31:59] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) done
[16:32:05] <how2hack> the problem is not "it's not working", the problem is tabbing will move the body to show the hidden tab
[16:32:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:32:28] <how2hack> if i add display none to the hidden tabs, will their content get focus?
[16:32:29] <robertmaxrees> because you're positining the content outside of the viewport.
[16:32:46] <taplar> why not if it is hidden, set the tabindex="-1" ?
[16:32:49] <robertmaxrees> so if you stop positioning them outside of the viewport, the problem goes away.
[16:32:51] <how2hack> yes i know why it happens, i'm trying to fix it
[16:32:56] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[16:32:56] <robertmaxrees> l;ol
[16:33:32] <how2hack> but if i position them inside the viewport can i still do the animation?
[16:34:03] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what the animation is since I don't have a test case in front of me.
[16:34:06] <how2hack> anyways, hidden content should not get focus
[16:34:09] <robertmaxrees> this is why I asked that exact question earlier.
[16:34:27] <robertmaxrees> taplar has a good suggest.
[16:34:27] <Robdgreat> who said hidden content gets focus?
[16:34:32] <robertmaxrees> set tabindex-1
[16:34:37] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat it's not actually hidden content.
[16:34:45] <Robdgreat> I meant actual hidden content
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> it's positioned out of the viewport.
[16:34:52] <Robdgreat> I understand that
[16:35:13] <Robdgreat> how2hack's concern seemed to be (as I read it) that properly hiding it might let it get focus
[16:35:56] <how2hack> so giving the tabs display none should prevent their inputs from getting focus?
[16:36:06] <taplar> anything hidden cannot be focused
[16:36:12] <taplar> truely hidden, as in display none
[16:36:30] <how2hack> ok, then i just need to create an animation
[16:36:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:36:35] <robertmaxrees> what
[16:37:17] <Robdgreat> if only transitions were built into css
[16:37:20] <Robdgreat> that'd be handy
[16:37:32] <how2hack> so that the animation is played, once is outside the viewport (at 100%) i give it display none
[16:37:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:37:49] <robertmaxrees> but why set it outside of the viewport at all at that point?
[16:37:56] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were doing that just to hide it.
[16:38:30] <how2hack> i'd like the tabs to have a changing transition
[16:38:48] <how2hack> is it possible to do that without moving them outside?
[16:38:51] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i don't understand what that has to do with anything.
[16:39:05] <robertmaxrees> since i don't know what the animation looks like, I have no idea.
[16:39:25] <how2hack> what i want is the tabs to appear from one side, do they need to be outside to make that animation?
[16:39:38] <robertmaxrees> you mean slide in from one side?
[16:39:40] <robertmaxrees> like a carouself?
[16:39:43] <robertmaxrees> *carousel
[16:39:57] <how2hack> yes, something like that
[16:40:07] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:40:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:40:14] <how2hack> moving tabs lol
[16:41:21] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason i kept asking those questions.
[16:41:51] <robertmaxrees> they effectively do need to be positioned outside a parent container.  if you set display none on them then you should be fine.
[16:42:34] <robertmaxrees> or the tabindex trick taplar mentioned.
[16:43:53] <how2hack> i think i'll go with the tabindex trick, i don't feel like creating an animation just to disable the tabbing on hidden content
[16:44:11] <taplar> so you have some existing animation for the "hiding", yes?
[16:44:55] <how2hack> just a class that sets position absolute and transform: translateX(100%)
[16:45:05] <taplar> ah, so it's all css based
[16:45:22] <robertmaxrees> is there a reason you're moving elements like that and not an overflowed container?
[16:45:26] <how2hack> yes, but jquery handles it
[16:45:28] <taplar> nvm, i was going to suggest an animation done callback that set the display to none, but nvm
[16:46:44] <how2hack> robertmaxrees: dunno, it's the first approach that came to mind, i'm sure it can be done in many different ways
[16:47:41] <robertmaxrees> the overflowing container is nice in cases like this because it means that when a user tabs through the page, just that section moves.
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> instead of the whole page.
[16:49:19] <how2hack> hmmm wait i'm mixing things, i'm actually reusing the tab code for the step process of this page (shop), this shouldn't be a tab page, but a page with two steps
[16:51:03] <how2hack> the overflowing container looks interesting for the normal tab pages
[16:51:25] <how2hack> but do i have to rewrite it all right?
[16:51:39] <robertmaxrees> probably be a small refactor.
[16:51:56] <how2hack> how does it work?
[16:54:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/hysutzwg/2/
[16:56:18] <how2hack> yes, exactly as with my case
[16:57:19] <how2hack> is there a tab handler in jquery? i need to change the tab's button class
[16:57:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/hysutzwg/3/
[16:57:30] <robertmaxrees> not within jquery, no.
[16:57:44] <robertmaxrees> but that's just addClass/removeClass
[16:58:00] <how2hack> yes, then i have to listen for the tab key?
[16:58:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:58:20] <robertmaxrees> what problem are you solving for now?
[16:58:29] <how2hack> i mean when i go from one article to the other using tab key i need to update the buttons
[16:59:07] <robertmaxrees> disappear.gif
[17:26:56] <destramic> can i get some help with this please? https://jsfiddle.net/1umrckbj/    trying to work out time difference but its not working for times closer together
[17:31:17] <taplar> it would probably be easiest to convert every thing to minutes, subtract, and then convert back
[17:32:29] <destramic> taplar: ok thank you :)
[17:35:23] <destramic> taplar: how would i convert 01 to just 1 please ?
[17:36:02] <destramic> so i can do 1 hour / 60
[17:36:04] <taplar> parseInt('01') == 1
[17:36:14] <destramic> ty
[17:43:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1umrckbj/25/ could be one approach
[18:03:11] <destramic> taplar: thank you :)
[18:05:40] <destramic> taplar: slide that beauty :)   https://jsfiddle.net/7034nys2/
[18:06:25] <destramic> shame my slide to time function is poor compared to your writing standards
[18:07:22] <taplar> so long as it works, :)
[18:07:58] <taplar> just make sure to scope your variables properly
[18:08:18] <taplar> i noticed a few variables in your original function that were not defined with var to being with, so they were globals
[18:09:18] <destramic> taplar: thanks for the tip and the help once again  wo0t!
