[00:26:28] <thomasA_> hi, i'm trying to replace the html of one element to another, but does all jquery that's then set up for that element null and void?
[00:26:45] <thomasA_> it seems all the ('#foo') just stop. i can't see any errors in the console
[00:30:19] <thomasA_> the jquery event handling is set up after the modification of the data

[15:51:55] <Voyage> Hi
[15:52:09] <Voyage> How to get an alert message if a div is loaded?
[15:58:46] <MACscr> I have a tricky need. I need to figure out a way to dynamically remove weekdays from the availabledates without actually changing the original code. Right now I am simply trying to replace the original date range: http://jsfiddle.net/yXMKC/1892/
[15:58:59] <MACscr> Voyage: you need to expand on that question a bit
[16:13:57] <Voyage> MACscr,  I want to do alert('boo'); when inner text of a div is changed OR loaded
[16:20:04] <Voyage> How can I  alert('boo'); when inner text of a div is changed OR loaded
[16:30:20] <Voyage> How can I  alert('boo'); when inner text of a div is changed OR loaded
[16:48:09] <shoky> Voyage: you can't do it for when inner text changes in a cross-browser way, i think.  and donno what you mean by "loaded". and stop spamming please
[17:21:57] <noregret> disabling the current element is just $(this).prop('disabled', true)? or is there another recommended method?
[17:35:19] <shoky> noregret looks good
[18:47:33] <bobdobbs`> can I ask questions about jquery UI here?
[18:47:46] <shoky> yes
[18:47:50] <bobdobbs`> :D
[18:48:21] <bobdobbs`> Thanks. I'm just uploading the site with my issue now. I'll ask a question shortly.
[18:49:36] <bobdobbs`> Ok, I've got this simple form on this page: http://staging.defensevids.com/
[18:50:04] <bobdobbs`> There's an element in that form  that isn't currently visible to the eye: $('.lr-slider')
[18:50:30] <bobdobbs`> I'm trying to make that element into a jQueryUI slider
[18:51:07] <bobdobbs`> I've called the jQueryUI core and the slider script. The page has a stylesheet for the slider
[18:51:45] <bobdobbs`> And on DOM ready, I've got a call that applies the slider script to the element.
[18:51:54] <bobdobbs`> one sec, I'll paste the link to the script...
[18:52:27] <bobdobbs`> http://staging.defensevids.com/wp-content/themes/lightrail/js/lightrail.js
[18:53:36] <bobdobbs`> now, my simple call in my simple script must do *something*, because when I inspect the element I see that the classnames for the slider are being injected into the class property of the element
[18:53:48] <bobdobbs`> however, I'm not seeing the element.
[18:53:58] <bobdobbs`> It has no height
[18:54:15] <bobdobbs`> This sounds like a rookie thing, but... it's as if the css isn't being applied
[18:55:24] <bobdobbs`> I can see that the file jquery-ui.css is being loaded.
[18:55:59] <bobdobbs`> But I've never used jQueryUI before. Do I need another stylesheet?
[19:00:23] <bobdobbs`> oh yeah... I can also see that the stylesheet I'm loading (jquery-ui.css) clearly has styles for the slider.
[19:00:37] <bobdobbs`> I generated that stylesheet using the themeroller
[19:01:23] <bobdobbs`> but yeah. those styles just aren't being applied.
[19:04:51] <ngharo> bobdobbs`: look at your <link> tag for jquery-ui.css
[19:04:55] <ngharo> media="1" ?
[19:05:48] <bobdobbs`> interesting
[19:07:51] <bobdobbs`> I'm not sure what that means. The tag is generated by the CMS I'm using.
[19:08:06] <bobdobbs`> I'll see if it yields a validation error
[19:08:53] <bobdobbs`> it does
[19:09:03] <ngharo> yeah, it should be a valid media query
[19:09:04] <bobdobbs`> "bad value '1'..."
[19:09:19] <ngharo> or just omit the attribute all together
[19:09:44] <ngharo> i think it's preventing browser from fetching the stylesheet
[19:10:07] <bobdobbs`> are you sure? I seem to be loading it over the network from here.
[19:10:37] <bobdobbs`> oh hey!
[19:10:38] <shoky> bobdobbs` the css is not being loaded
[19:11:01] <bobdobbs`> I've fixed it locally. I tweaked the CMS's call to the stylesheet.
[19:11:08] <bobdobbs`> and the slider appeared.
[19:11:48] <bobdobbs`> twas a wordpress thing
[19:11:54] <bobdobbs`> thank you
[19:12:07] * ngharo high fives
[19:12:17] * bobdobbs` returns hi-five
[19:12:37] <bobdobbs`> ngharo: just out of curiosity, are you polynesian? Just wondering cos the 'ng' appears in a lot of polynesian words and names
[19:13:03] <ngharo> nope
[19:14:48] <bobdobbs`> I think the word "ngaro" means "to obscure a thing" in maori
[19:18:16] <ngharo> neato
[20:17:32] <MACscr> any ideas what I am doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/fhyre4fm/4/. The default selection doesnt seem to be working as no dates show available in the calendar, but it works correctly if i change the option to weekends only
[22:12:41] <_twg_> I've got the click function for my hyperlink but how can I call the slideToggle on the ul inside the li element?
[22:53:06] <MACscr> date.getDay is not a function
[22:53:51] <MACscr> getDay() is obviously a js function
[22:54:08] <MACscr> is the problem the variable name I am using?
[22:56:31] <MACscr> oh, maybe date needs to be a specific format?
[23:03:20] <arc_> MACscr it has to be a date object. perhaps you are passing a jquery object?
[23:03:43] <arc_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getDay
[23:05:26] <MACscr> i was just passing a date string =P
[23:06:07] <MACscr> like so 9-2-2016
[23:06:15] <arc_> ah
[23:06:41] <MACscr> i am using the datepicker plugin, supposedly that can change it to the correct format, but im not sure how yet
[23:06:43] <MACscr> looking
