[00:07:49] <esaym153> can my classes and ids have spaces in them? like: <div class="my stupid class" id="why this"></div>  ?
[00:09:43] <esaym153> looks like no, crap-
[01:09:53] <siaw> can someone please help me so that when i click “hide me now” the divs disappear one by one instead of all fading out at once? https://jsfiddle.net/um7ctpnj/1/
[01:18:42] <zumba_ad_> Good evening everyone. I need your help. why could be the reason why event.target is not including the outside <a href>? This is the code - http://pastebin.com/tTX5uWLm
[01:19:04] <zumba_ad_> why/what
[01:30:44] <zumba_ad_> I fixed it. Changed target to currentTarget
[02:24:40] <Rudeboy> Hey guys, can anyone tell me why the second dropdown doesn't slide up with mouseleave? http://jsfiddle.net/owz6ww9z/
[02:24:58] <Rudeboy> Both dropdowns have the exact same code - really confusing :/
[02:47:34] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/7qc61j9f/ i try to get this to work but seems really hard.
[02:56:38] <paste> Hi! http://jsfiddle.net/bnqyfext/
[02:56:43] <paste> For some reason it's not working?
[02:59:16] <Cork> paste: don't use attr to check for form states
[02:59:27] <Cork> actually don't use attr unless prop gives you the wrong value
[02:59:34] <paste> ok?
[02:59:46] <Cork> attr checks the html attribute not the state of the element
[02:59:51] <paste> oh
[02:59:59] <Cork> also you can just to this.checked
[03:00:06] <Cork> no need for going through jquery
[03:00:12] <paste> How would i go on about it? I'm really a beginner just trying to pull it together :D
[03:00:34] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/bnqyfext/2/
[03:00:39] <Whiskey> Is it stupid to try use same toggle on both?
[03:00:51] <Whiskey> i mean as long as it get what class it is that use it it should work fine
[03:01:15] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/7qc61j9f/1/ got invert to work, bot switch view are gone
[03:02:19] <paste> That did it Cork! Thank you so much!
[03:06:15] <Whiskey> Cork?
[03:06:39] <Cork> Whiskey: i don't have time to dig through big code sections like that right now
[03:07:46] <Whiskey> Cork i think it was quite small
[03:08:05] <Whiskey> its the function toggleTo(id, target) { thats not working
[03:09:48] <Cork> check what data you send in to it (you prob want to change the variable name from id to something more correct)
[03:10:20] <Whiskey> yeh i found that out just now
[03:16:28] <Whiskey> can´t get it work cork
[03:20:30] <Whiskey> Cork: did something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/7qc61j9f/2/
[03:23:01] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/7qc61j9f/4/ <-- littel less code thats not need to be in the test case'
[03:24:44] <paste> Cork- Is it possible to read what state it's in? I'm making a todolist, and if it's checked i want to update the database and set the row to 0 (meaning completed) and if you uncheck it, i want to change it to 1.
[03:25:04] <Cork> paste: that is what your doing with checked
[03:25:11] <paste> oh
[03:25:11] <Cork> this.checked == true/false
[03:25:48] <paste> But i'm not passing it over to file.php right? I'm just checking first - if it's checked, pass it
[03:26:04] <paste> I would like to pass over the data like "checked" to file.php
[03:26:21] <Cork> paste: ya, your not
[03:26:44] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/7qc61j9f/5/ <-- more less that that can´t i do it i think
[03:26:52] <Cork> paste: normally you don't write checkboxes like that in html
[03:27:05] <Cork> paste: you have a hidden value that is the "unchecked" state
[03:27:10] <Cork> and it has the value 0
[03:27:29] <Cork> and then you have the checkbox with the name of what you want to check and the value 1
[03:27:41] <Cork> then you just serialize the form and send the result
[03:27:48] <Whiskey> I don´t see why it won´t work as i set an id then it should not use another one
[03:30:19] <paste> Ah, thank you Cork :)
[03:31:27] <Whiskey> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/7qc61j9f/6/ something like that
[03:42:12] <Whiskey> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/7qc61j9f/8/ that works
[03:52:51] <paste> Cork- Would it be possible to apply the exact same to <i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i> ?
[03:54:15] <Cork> paste: don't understand the question
[03:55:22] <paste> I have a button made out of <i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i>. Would it be possible to do the same like i did with the checkboxes? Passing something to another file with the help from jQuery?
[03:55:55] <Cork> you don't have files in web developement you have a resource (the webserver url)
[03:56:09] <Cork> if the resource is backed by a file depends on the server
[03:56:32] <paste> I was thinking like this $('.fa fa-trash-o').on('click', function() {
[03:56:32] <Cork> paste: to answer the question, sure
[03:56:37] <Cork> just bind a click handler
[03:56:38] <paste> Correct!
[04:02:22] <paste> Cork- What i'm having trouble understanding here (as a beginner) is how i can, with this <i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i> provide the jQuery the right ID.

[05:02:35] <jquery3> hi all
[05:12:46] <prillian5> someone using masonry plugin from http://masonry.desandro.com/ ?
[05:13:02] <barduck> is this by design that jquery doesn't send the HTTP-X-Requested-With header with requests to cross site domains or am I doing something wring?
[05:13:07] <barduck> *wrong
[05:13:13] <prillian5> I have problems with overlapping images. In the FAQ, they told to use imagesLoaded:http://masonry.desandro.com/faq.html
[05:13:31] <prillian5> But it seems not to be in the package anymore. Any Idea, what to do?
[05:14:45] <pokergod> I"m using .dragtable().  How do i 'delete' it if it exists, to recreate it?
[05:17:53] <prillian5> found it, imageIsLoad is another package of the contributer
[05:18:06] <pokergod> prillian5, any idea on my question
[05:57:03] <surianup> I have an issue guys
[05:57:47] <pastebin> don't we all...
[05:57:47] <pastebin> :D
[05:59:07] <surianup> when I am calling the ajax function, and I am getting response from server in html, that Html I am displaying but problem is that my dropdowns are not working  becasue that are creating with scripts but I have put that script into the footer
[05:59:29] <surianup> can anyone help me please to figure out the issue ?
[06:01:33] <Cork> Anup: you have to run the script again one the new elements
[06:02:24] <Anup> Cork: in sucess >
[06:02:26] <Anup> Cork: in sucess ?
[06:02:29] <Cork> yes
[06:03:22] <pastebin> Question: I have a div for my todolist. I want to, when checked, refresh it. How would i go on about doing that? AJAX? jQuery?
[06:03:24] <Anup> but I have many files like 40 -50 files approx then I have to call these files on everytimes ?
[06:03:51] <Cork> pastebin: you mean it should refresh every x time?
[06:04:02] <Cork> meaning auto update as things change?
[06:04:24] <pastebin> Changing once i click the checkbox (which you helped me with!)
[06:04:55] <Cork> ah
[06:05:01] <pastebin> I hope you understand what i mean? :)
[06:05:11] <Cork> well then ya, either send the new todolist back as a response
[06:05:15] <Cork> or make a new ajax call
[06:05:52] <Anup> are you asking to me Cork : ?
[06:06:13] <Cork> Anup: no you don't run the scripts
[06:06:23] <Cork> you need to run the function related to the action needed
[06:06:35] <Cork> if you run all the code straight in global in a bunch of script files
[06:06:38] <Cork> you have a bigger problem
[06:07:59] <Anup> Cork you mean I have to create a function and then paste all the script files in that function or wrape the scripts files in which and call that function when needed ?
[06:08:14] <pastebin> This is too complicated for me! haha.
[06:09:19] <Cork> Anup: uh, no
[06:09:42] <Cork> Anup: i mean you should have some form of grouping to your code so you can just invoke the part you need again
[06:12:06] <Anup> Cork : can you please give me a simple example here http://jsfiddle.net/srwa1eab/?
[06:12:34] <Cork> Anup: no cause there is no code to call
[06:13:19] <Cork> Anup: but if this gives you a hint http://jsfiddle.net/srwa1eab/1/
[06:13:47] <Cork> and no i don't mean you should duplicate the code...
[06:15:06] <Anup> Cork: I will try it thanks dear
[06:36:11] <Kartagis> how can log to console 1 or based on the state of a checkbox?
[06:36:24] <Kartagis> using ternary that is
[06:36:51] <Kartagis> 1 or 0*
[06:51:37] <pastebin> http://jsfiddle.net/zmxrf4fs/
[06:51:42] <pastebin> Isn't it possible to do it like that?
[06:55:58] <Kartagis> pastebin: you are missing a semicolon at the end of the load line
[06:56:46] <pastebin> Thank you! It's still not refreshing the div tho
[07:00:13] <Kartagis> what version of jquery are you using?
[07:00:24] <pastebin> <script src="plugins/jQuery/jQuery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
[07:01:00] <Kartagis> try replacing bind with on
[07:01:09] <Kartagis> bind is deprecated
[07:01:41] <pastebin> Still nothing
[07:02:11] <Kartagis> I can't help unless I see all markup
[07:04:23] <hellyeah> let say i have two functions in backend and they have same amount of parameters, parameter type and parameter names are same. Can i call these two methods by using one ajax call?
[07:04:30] <hellyeah> can you suggest me tutorial or smt?
[07:09:52] <robhol> no, you can't. you need to make one function server-side that calls them for you
[07:10:06] <hellyeah> ah
[07:10:11] <hellyeah> okey then i got it
[07:10:12] <hellyeah> thanks
[07:10:16] <hellyeah> brb
[07:52:20] <hellyeah> hey
[07:52:23] <hellyeah> let me ask this
[07:52:56] <hellyeah> if ajax request fails is there a mechanism for reporting the reason of failure like gettinrg status code of the page and explanation of that status code
[07:53:31] <Cork> hellyeah: the .fail handler?
[07:55:29] <hellyeah> Cork: i am using fail: function() yes
[07:55:42] <hellyeah> but what i mean is to know why ajax request fail
[07:55:44] <Cork> there is arguments for it
[07:55:54] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:56:00] <hellyeah> msg?
[07:56:47] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[07:57:03] <Cork> check the error callback section
[08:01:12] <arup_r> I am not able to remove click event using on()/off() .. I am using this Js http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/bVoKVL
[08:03:19] <Cork> uh, that code doesn't make any sense
[08:03:27] <arup_r> why ?
[08:03:31] <Cork> $(".options-list a#share-complete") could just be $("#share-complete")
[08:03:36] <Cork> cause ids are unique
[08:03:42] <arup_r> ok. that I will remove
[08:03:44] <Cork> no need for extra selectors
[08:03:51] <arup_r> yes, agree
[08:03:56] <Cork> (and it will only ever match one element)
[08:03:57] <arup_r> But still not working
[08:04:24] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/hzk3a166/
[08:04:24] <arup_r> I was doing something else.. but forgot to remove the .options-list
[08:04:27] <Cork> add the missing html
[08:04:37] <arup_r> that is big
[08:04:39] <arup_r> ok adding
[08:04:41] <Cork> an
[08:04:53] <Cork> you have a rweturn from the .on/off you should remove that
[08:05:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/hzk3a166/1/
[08:05:18] <anli> Is it possible to inspect any element in chrome, even if the writer of it were overrideing the right click event?
[08:05:26] <anli> -e
[08:05:45] <Cork> anli: sure open the inspector and click the magnifying glass
[08:06:13] <anli> Many thanks! :)
[08:06:13] <Cork> (left side of the toolbar)
[08:06:19] <anli> I am happy I asked
[08:07:06] <Cork> arup_r: btw the on('click') isn't doing what you think it does
[08:07:18] <Cork> arup_r: that is prob what is tripping you up
[08:07:26] <Rudeboy> Hey guys, can anyone tell me why the second dropdown in this jsfiddle doesn't slideup on mouseleave? http://jsfiddle.net/owz6ww9z/
[08:07:31] <Rudeboy> They both use the exact same code
[08:07:36] <anli> Why do people use on("click") instead of just click?
[08:07:48] <Cork> arup_r: .off('click') removes all click handlers from the element, .on('click') does nothing as you aren't giving it a callback function
[08:08:00] <Cork> anli: a new cleaner syntax
[08:08:08] <anli> How is it cleaner?
[08:08:15] <Cork> anli: also .click calls .on in the background
[08:08:36] <Cork> anli: it supports all events styles, not just the old 1.0 era ones that has shortcuts
[08:08:43] <Cork> like .on('input') for example
[08:08:56] <Cork> or on('touchstart')
[08:08:56] <anli> Yeah, thats why I am forced into using on sometimes
[08:09:35] <Cork> i don't think i've used the shortcut functions since 1.2.3 days
[08:09:39] <arup_r> ok. Cork got it. How can I dynamically disable and enable an <a>?
[08:09:48] <Cork> you can't
[08:09:53] <arup_r> oh. then..?
[08:09:57] <Cork> best option is to have an event handler on it
[08:10:05] <Cork> and then set .data('disabled', true/false)
[08:10:22] <Cork> then in the event handler only do something to prevent it if data('disabled') == true
[08:10:47] <Cork> arup_r: the dom doesn't have a way to disable event handlers only add and remove
[08:11:06] <Rudeboy> If anyone can help me, I'd REALLY appreciate it. Been battling with the issue for days, and am sure it's a simple fix?
[08:11:16] <arup_r> Is this correct way? http://stackoverflow.com/a/19477318/2767755 but i see the solution doesn't work on IE as per the comments
[08:11:31] <Cork> not really
[08:11:54] <Cork> firstly it makes the element completely impossible to interact with (including selecting the text)
[08:11:58] <Cork> and it doesn't work in all browsers
[08:12:11] <arup_r> ok. Cork I will go with the idea you gave,
[08:12:47] <arup_r> I will use some CSS to realize users that button is disabled and enabled,
[08:12:54] <arup_r> and rest I wil do as you said
[08:12:55] <Cork> (and that it isn't the correct way doesn't surprise me, it is from the so after all...)
[08:13:11] <Cork> arup_r: sure, you should
[08:13:18] <arup_r> yes, thanks
[08:13:33] <Cork> but pointer-event is really new, and still a bit left for full support outside svg
[08:14:17] <Cork> but ya if you don't have ie users with ie < 11 it is an option
[08:14:53] <arup_r> I liked the data thing :)
[08:15:08] <Cork> arup_r: is the link a real url?
[08:15:17] <Cork> or are you just using a broken link for click actions?
[08:15:35] <arup_r> broken means ?
[08:15:35] <Cork> cause if you are doing the later a better option is to use <button type="button"></button>
[08:15:45] <Cork> <a href="#"></a> for example
[08:15:52] <arup_r> no. It is a real url
[08:15:54] <Cork> ok
[08:16:17] <Cork> arup_r: another option is to move the href to data-href
[08:16:27] <Cork> and make that move when the link is disabled
[08:17:01] <arup_r> you mean copy form data to href when length is not 0 and vice versa ?
[08:17:14] <Cork> var share = $('#share-complete'); share.data('href', share.attr('href')).removeAttr('href')
[08:17:27] <Cork> disable ^
[08:17:44] <Cork> var share = $('#share-complete'); share.prop('href', share.data('href'))
[08:17:47] <Cork> enable ^
[08:18:32] <arup_r> hum. it saves some lines of code.. but clean
[08:18:58] <Cork> it depends on if you want to prevent ex right click open in new tab
[08:19:03] <Cork> the later fixes that
[08:19:07] <Cork> the former doesn't
[08:19:52] <arup_r> wow. nice learning this one.
[08:20:04] <arup_r> didn't know the right click thing
[08:20:28] <Cork> d&d the link is another example
[08:20:51] <arup_r> which one /
[08:20:51] <Cork> though note you should also have a check server side if you really need to make sure ppl don't do it
[08:20:52] <arup_r> ?
[08:21:00] <Cork> the one where you remove the href attribute
[08:21:27] <arup_r> ok. You mean if someone manually, put the link to the href and hit it ?
[08:21:35] <arup_r> from the browser
[08:21:36] <Cork> no
[08:21:41] <Cork> the click solution
[08:21:46] <Cork> if you mousedown on the link
[08:21:53] <Cork> then drag it to ex the tabstrip
[08:21:55] <Cork> and drop it there
[08:22:02] <Cork> the old solution doesn't prevent that either
[08:22:12] <arup_r> o i see
[08:22:35] <arup_r> humm.. far distance to go yet.. :) I am still kid it seems
[08:23:35] <Cork> Rudeboy: cause you have two elements with the same id
[08:23:52] <Cork> Rudeboy: an id can only exist on one element in a valid dom, so the second entry gets ignored
[08:24:10] <Cork> Rudeboy: use a class if you want to identify multiple elements
[08:26:28] <Rudeboy> Cork: Ah!! Ok cool, thanks so much - I honestly couldn't work it out!
[08:26:51] <arup_r> How can I stop to write the same selector 2 times ("table#assets tbody tr td.select-checkbox)? http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/bVoKVL
[08:27:12] <arup_r> it looks ugly.
[08:27:18] <Cork> arup_r: .... stop putting tag entries infront of ids...
[08:27:29] <arup_r> ok. that I will do
[08:28:02] <arup_r> but my pain is rather different, i hope you got it.. :)
[08:28:16] <arup_r> I removed ID from my code.
[08:28:43] <Cork> arup_r: http://jsfiddle.net/ogv8b9v1/
[08:29:20] <Cork> arup_r: you removed the wrong part it sounds like the comment was about the tag name not the id
[08:29:46] <Cork> table#id is pointless why first search for all tables, to later filter on an unique id?
[08:30:07] <Cork> just get the element in the browsers id hash matching the id
[08:30:28] <arup_r> got it. I removed from my editor not from there sorry :(
[08:30:44] <Cork> also you might not need the "tr" in the selector
[08:30:52] <Cork> doesn't look like it should be
[08:31:02] <Cork> (you want to keep selectors as short as possible)
[08:31:14] <Cork> tbody makes sense if you have thead
[08:31:24] <Cork> but tr shouldn't be needed there
[08:31:27] <arup_r> I have thead
[08:31:31] <arup_r> ok
[08:34:39] <arup_r> on first time load I have the url as href = "#" .. and if I click the url it does call the controller..
[08:34:44] <arup_r> something wrong http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/bVoKVL
[08:43:29] <arup_r> if I lick it is taking me to the current page url.. and if I hover it it is showing me : http://localhost:3000/tenants/1/resources/1/resources# but dom has nothing
[08:52:37] <PythDasch>  Hi :) could someone tell me why in an ajax request I can't return something ? because I tried to embrace the ajax post to be not async like, but it still not returning true or false :( http://dpaste.com/3HVVZ7J
[08:53:20] <Cork> PythDasch: you should never run networks calls syncronically
[08:53:31] <Cork> it results in a really bad user experience
[08:53:52] <PythDasch> I know but How can I validate each fields of the form ?
[08:54:38] <Cork> PythDasch: you would have to use something that doesn't relay on return values
[08:55:05] <Cork> PythDasch: the code you have there runs return and the value is returned
[08:55:14] <Cork> but it is returned to .done() not _validate
[08:55:35] <robhol> in the case of validation, it's customary to do it both client-side and server-side
[08:55:55] <Cork> robhol: yes and no
[08:56:04] <Cork> some test can't be done client side
[08:56:05] <robhol> client-side because you don't want to have to make the user wait if you can avoid it - server-side because you can't rely on client validation working properly
[08:56:17] <PythDasch> that's the problem
[08:56:22] <robhol> well, obviously..
[08:56:22] <PythDasch> I need both
[08:56:46] <Cork> PythDasch: by client side he meant you write the rules for the validation in javascript
[08:56:57] <Cork> so it doesn't have to throw the question cross the wire to know if it is valid
[08:57:03] <PythDasch> But I tried to put the response from .done into another variable and to return value but I can't manage to do this
[08:57:12] <Cork> ya, but network is async
[08:57:22] <Cork> so the variable will be used before it is set from the callback
[08:57:25] <PythDasch> Yes but I can't rely only on client side valdiation
[08:57:40] <PythDasch> I've some datas that I need in server side
[08:57:56] <Cork> then on submit return the failure status
[08:58:07] <Cork> it is the least annoying user experience
[08:58:29] <PythDasch> Yes but my form is like this one : http://tympanus.net/Development/FullscreenForm/
[08:58:35] <Cork> or if you are ok with high server load
[08:58:43] <PythDasch> If I render all errors at the end, it's not user friendly
[08:58:48] <Cork> fire it on input event and show a live validation
[08:59:24] <PythDasch> That's what I'm trying to do. Each time I change fields, it validate server side, and can go to the next one
[08:59:31] <Cork> PythDasch: you need to get out of the syncron thinking before you have a chance of solving this
[08:59:40] <Cork> the solution isn't to get things to be syncron
[08:59:48] <PythDasch> it's quite quick the server response, but can't figure out how to return true in this._validate
[08:59:58] <Cork> cause that means the page will freeze for unknown amount of time while the page waits for the server
[09:00:05] <Cork> that is even worse then what you have now
[09:00:26] <PythDasch> so how can I proceed ? What do you suggest ?
[09:01:00] <Cork> you need to look over the code to for example do the form post through ajax
[09:01:07] <Cork> then check the validation response
[09:01:15] <Cork> and then add the error messages where you want them
[09:01:25] <Cork> alternatively submit each fields values as the user types it
[09:01:33] <Cork> and show hints that the value is invalid
[09:01:42] <Cork> but that means loads of extra load on the server
[09:02:53] <PythDasch> like real time validation ?.
[09:03:05] <Cork> well kinda
[09:03:11] <Cork> except it isn't real time
[09:03:23] <Cork> as it has to travel over the network
[09:03:26] <PythDasch> but is it not what I'm trying to do ?
[09:03:39] <PythDasch> or you suggest to do the validation in a separate function
[09:03:42] <Cork> not fully sure what youre trying to do
[09:03:49] <Cork> you didn't include that in the code snippet
[09:04:02] <Cork> but you are trying to return values from an async ajax call, and that won't ever work
[09:04:03] <PythDasch> I'll put the whole javascript
[09:04:17] <Cork> not what is using FF (what ever it was called)
[09:04:37] <PythDasch> http://dpaste.com/0ZHG78Z
[09:04:51] <PythDasch> In fact, I'm using the Form of the link I write
[09:05:02] <PythDasch> and I was trying to override the validation process
[09:05:41] <Cork> PythDasch: so this is the problem if( this.isLastStep || !this._validate() || this.isAnimating ) {
[09:05:43] <PythDasch> to send the value of the field entered, and when he click on continue (or enter) to validate this value server side
[09:05:53] <Cork> it has to be made to work asyncronically
[09:06:02] <Cork> (simplest is prob to use deferred)
[09:06:09] <PythDasch> what is deferred ?
[09:06:26] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[09:06:41] <Cork> it is what $.ajax().done() is for example
[09:06:54] <PythDasch> ok
[09:07:06] <PythDasch> so you suggest to remove this line and use deferred instead ?
[09:07:07] <Cork> PythDasch: but FForm needs to be fixed to stop using return values
[09:07:10] <Cork> no
[09:07:19] <Cork> i say you will have to rewrite FForm
[09:07:24] <Cork> cause it requires syncron code
[09:07:39] <Cork> and that isn't compatible with network based validation
[09:07:39] <PythDasch> seems tough ^^
[09:08:03] <Cork> not that tough if you know how the FForm works
[09:08:18] <Cork> the tought part is reading through what it does
[09:08:31] <PythDasch> I know how it works basically but I'll have to use deferred to make it async
[09:08:31] <Cork> (or rather the time consuming part)
[09:08:46] <Cork> PythDasch: no you don't have to use deferred
[09:08:52] <Cork> it is just the simplest way to do it
[09:08:58] <Cork> you could use callbacks too
[09:08:58] <PythDasch> ha
[09:09:08] <Cork> but that tends to mean more rewrites
[09:09:12] <PythDasch> y but I don't know so much about object with javascript
[09:09:47] <Cork> PythDasch: the basic of it is that the functions you get true/false return values from and use in that if statemetn
[09:09:56] <Cork> have to give you callback hooks instead
[09:10:01] <Cork> and you have to trigger on those hooks
[09:10:27] <Cork> so you basically have to fire the async checks and then wait for them all to come back before moving on
[09:10:30] <PythDasch> it's a bit like I've to listen if the value change and when it change I can launch next function
[09:10:37] <Cork> $.when is good for that if you use deferred
[09:10:50] <PythDasch> hm I'll try I think
[09:11:14] <PythDasch> Thx :)
[09:11:18] <Cork> PythDasch: more like you have to request the info and then wait for the answer to be ready
[09:11:31] <PythDasch> y
[09:11:35] <Cork> "when it change" again means syncron :)
[09:11:52] <PythDasch> It's cool because I was stuck with this async ^^
[09:12:09] <Cork> ya, you should prob read up a bit on async javascript
[09:12:43] <PythDasch> I will I think. I know it's like async is launching in parallel of the normal flow
[09:12:46] <PythDasch> but that's it
[09:13:16] <Cork> PythDasch: no that is threaded
[09:13:31] <Cork> async means the code efter doesn't get blocked/wait for it
[09:13:34] <pastebin> What i don't understand here is, what data is sent? http://jsfiddle.net/uo81e1p8/
[09:13:43] <Cork> ugg mixed language...
[09:13:52] <Cork> async means the code after doesn't get blocked...
[09:14:25] <Cork> pastebin: serialize collects all the fields connected to the form
[09:14:39] <Cork> and build a name=value&name=value string from that
[09:14:40] <pastebin> does it collect the raw html, or the value only?
[09:14:41] <PythDasch> ok Cork :) Thank you a lot :)
[09:14:45] <pastebin> alright - thank you!
[09:14:50] <Cork> pastebin: it is based on the dom, not the html
[09:15:00] <Cork> PythDasch: good luck

[09:27:36] <aro> if i bind a listener $(document.body).on('submit', '#FormHandler', function(e) { });
[09:27:39] <aro> how do i remove that binding?
[09:27:50] <aro> can you just do $('#FormHandler').off() ?
[09:31:04] <pastebin> http://jsfiddle.net/y2e92533/
[09:31:08] <pastebin> It's just not working
[09:31:51] <Cork> aro: no, the event handler is bound on body, so you can't remove a none existing handler from #FormHandler
[09:33:51] <anli> Is there an "eye-dropper" that can tell me from which css rule a certain pixel got its color?
[09:34:08] <Cork> no
[09:34:25] <Cork> color is per element so just pick the element and look through the rule list

[10:11:57] <arup_r> How can I prevent the request to controller when I click on the link which has "#"
[10:12:18] <arup_r> ok. No idea how link_to should be used to prepare what you said.

[10:41:08] <pastebin> Was only meant to c/p save_todo.php but got the whole line ;>
[10:42:12] <BillCriswell> What if you do $('#form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); ... }); instead of the return false.
[10:42:37] <pastebin> tried it, does the same
[10:43:30] <pastebin> I'm not sure what im doing wrong
[10:43:47] <pastebin> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

[10:44:51] <pastebin> Question is how to reload the div, once the data is posted so it auto-adds
[10:44:53] <BillCriswell> What did you change?
[10:46:09] <pastebin> i forgot to change the damn filename
[10:46:15] <BillCriswell> pastebin: You can return the data you want from the save_todo.php as JSON or something and append it.
[10:46:16] <theskillwithin> haha
[10:46:26] <BillCriswell> Happens to everyone.
[10:46:32] <BillCriswell> Keep an eye on that network tab.
[10:46:50] <pastebin> That's what you get when you get tired of trying to fix issues i guess :)
[10:47:45] <pastebin> Problem is, this is pretty much my first time touching JS/jQuery/Ajax, i know php and HTML. But i'm not sure how the flow would be of returning it. Now, i fetch it from the DB and prints it out directly.
[10:50:01] <BillCriswell> That can work. If you need that data in other places you're kind of limited to the HTML it returns, where if you get it in JSON you can make the HTML whatever the hell you want.
[10:53:53] <Krazylegz> Hi, I'm wondering what would be the appropriate channel for a QUnit question?

[11:56:09] <xniz> hey guys.. im creating a page for my portfolio for the graphic designs i've done.  All of my images are of different resolutions, so what I would like to do is to create some sort of plugin that will crop each image from the center origin and display a square cropped version of the photo in a series... does anyone have any suggestions on where to begin in regards to searching on google or any references that can help me achieve
[11:56:09] <xniz> this result
[11:57:01] <duch_kazatel> could you just html and css to do that.
[11:57:03] <xniz> possibly even something simple with CSS (i know this isnt the CSS channel, but the only other thing I have came up with is having div's for each
[11:57:06] <duch_kazatel> *could just use
[11:57:11] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  beat me to it lol
[11:57:18] <xniz> using the background-image property?
[11:57:40] <duch_kazatel> and that's basically what you'd do - two divs - one that holds the image, and then another that shows the "cropped" image.
[12:00:04] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  cool. thanks for the input. I will give it a go
[12:13:39] <pentaho_ce> hi friends
[12:15:25] <duch_kazatel> hellooooooo!
[12:20:27] <OnceMe> how can I select with mulitple selectors.... e.g. <div id="new"> blabla <div id="new2"></div></div>
[12:20:42] <duch_kazatel> just like with css, OnceMe
[12:20:51] <OnceMe> yeah but I have issue
[12:20:53] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:21:06] <OnceMe> new2 is going to get new elements appended
[12:21:16] <duch_kazatel> so then what do you really want?
[12:47:19] <Venko> Hey, quick question. If I call $('#IdThatDoesNotExist').html(value) what happens?
[12:47:29] <duch_kazatel> nothing.
[12:47:36] <duch_kazatel> jquery checks to see if that element exusts first.
[12:47:40] <Venko> I've tried it and it doesn't add an error to my Google Chrome console. Does it check for the Id, see there isn't one, and gracefully do nothing?
[12:47:47] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:47:48] <Venko> As I suspected. Brilliant thanks
[12:47:54] <duch_kazatel> lots of jquery methods do that.
[12:55:58] <YokoBR> guys, i have an api that checks if the IP is authenticated before sendind the content. I need to parse the xml from this url, but I cannot use google's api or yahoo, because the request ip would be different
[12:56:00] <pentaho_ce> anybody can tell me one good book of jquery as examples ?
[12:56:12] <duch_kazatel> pentaho_ce learn.jquery.com is a good place to start.
[12:56:22] <YokoBR> is there any way to parse locally the XML with jquery?
[12:56:26] <pentaho_ce> duch_kazatel: thanks
[12:56:38] <duch_kazatel> YokoBR https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/

[12:58:52] <YokoBR> this is my code to parse it http://pastebin.com/9ZTJvUNV
[12:59:09] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[13:01:22] <fabio> Hello guys, im having a problem when i try to use $.getJSON   On my chrome console i see the route being called but not fires up the .done()
[13:01:28] <fabio> what could be?
[13:01:31] <duch_kazatel> an error.
[13:01:40] <fabio> duch_kazatel, very funny...
[13:01:44] <duch_kazatel> uh
[13:01:49] <duch_kazatel> that's what would cause that.
[13:01:51] <duch_kazatel> not a joke.,
[13:01:52] <hydraidm801> how do I handle multiple scripts that have document ready? Will JS know to run them all together or will they run one after another?
[13:01:55] <fabio> in fact, i dont see any error
[13:02:05] <duch_kazatel> fabio because jquery is swallowing it, fabio
[13:02:09] <fabio> my crome console is cristal clear
[13:02:11] <duch_kazatel> check the .fail() callback.
[13:02:25] <fabio> humm
[13:03:07] <duch_kazatel> hydraidm801 they run one after the other.
[13:03:13] <duch_kazatel> in the order they were registered.
[13:06:24] <hydraidm801> I have some jQuery code that is dynamically created and when it is ran. I can't seem to find it in the console. But I need to set a break point some how
[13:06:51] <duch_kazatel> "dynaimcally created"?
[13:06:56] <duch_kazatel> *dynamically created
[13:07:02] <duch_kazatel> mind clarifying that statement?
[13:16:13] <hydraidm801> duch_kazatel, I .get() to the server and include a <script></script> inside it along with some HTML
[14:34:36] <hydraidm801> how do I see if something is an html label or html input ?
[14:38:57] <BillCriswell> hydraidm801: You can use `.is`
[14:39:12] <BillCriswell> So like, if ($someEl.is('input')) { }
[14:40:15] <hydraidm801> would all form elements be input ?
[14:40:37] <hydraidm801> like text, textarea, checkbox, ect
[14:46:41] <Uhkis> textarea no
[14:53:48] <z1haze> is it possible to determine which selector was hit when deciding what to do in a fucntion? like if you have a catchall function that takes actions from .delete, .modify, etc.. and in my ajax response success, i want to delete specific elements from the dom, but depending on which selector was triggered i need to remove different things
[14:58:39] <BillCriswell> hydraidm801: There's a special jquery `:input` selector that would get them all basically.
[14:59:12] <hydraidm801> BillCriswell, so like $('#myform :input') ?
[14:59:52] <BillCriswell> I was thinking $someEl.is(':input'), what are you trying to do in particular?
[15:02:30] <hydraidm801> I was just double checking a function was getting all the form values and I didn't want to read all the labels
[15:02:43] <hydraidm801> how would I get the value of this element <input type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="tPNMLTwCbyUQQ925o8bcAiIzFeP5dyV4"> ?
[15:03:11] <BillCriswell> What are you getting all the values for?
[15:03:26] <BillCriswell> hydraidm801: You can do $thatEl.val();
[15:04:08] <hydraidm801> for an .ajax() post
[15:04:33] <BillCriswell> Ok, glad I asked. In that case you can use .serializeArray() on the form.
[15:05:11] <hydraidm801> BillCriswell, $('#myform').serializeArray()
[15:05:13] <BillCriswell> $('#someForm').serializeArray() will return an array of objects that work with the ajax function.
[15:05:16] <BillCriswell> hydraidm801: Yes.
[15:06:27] <hydraidm801> k but there is one more step. Not all the required values of the form are in the HTML for the user. I exclude some of them on the backend. I figured I had to just list all the values in the data: of .ajax()
[15:07:13] <hydraidm801> will .ajax() know what is what with the serializeArray() + fields that I have to manually include based on the user
[15:07:37] <BillCriswell> You can push to serialzeArray() then use it in ajax.
[15:08:03] <hydraidm801> oh okay I didn't think of that
[15:08:04] <BillCriswell> So like var data = $form.serialzeArray(); then data.push({ name: "someExtraData", value: "Some Value" });
[15:09:04] <BillCriswell> Yeah, a nice thing I figured out a while back is console.table($someForm.serialzeArray()); for a nice view of what's being submitted.
[15:09:57] <hydraidm801> I've always wondered if there more methods other than console.log() lol
[15:11:34] <BillCriswell> There's .group and a bunch of other useful ones.
[15:12:09] <BillCriswell> https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API good list here
[15:13:16] <hydraidm801> nice!
[15:24:24] <t432> is there a quick way to select all children except the last one?
[15:24:49] <t432> $('foo').children() << exclude the last child
[15:35:42] <duch_kazatel> .filter()
[15:37:26] <BillCriswell> .slice(0, -1) could also work.
[15:37:44] <duch_kazatel> yeah, lots of choices.
[15:38:08] <z1haze> if i have a function that is triggered by multiple selectors, is there a way to determine which selector was used to trigger the function? like in an if statement
[15:38:32] <duch_kazatel> selector or element?
[15:38:48] <z1haze> um, not sure. maybe element
[15:38:50] <duch_kazatel> like, did you want to know if the element has a particular class or something?
[15:38:54] <z1haze> yea
[15:39:07] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/is/
[15:39:11] <z1haze> like if my function is triggered by clicking either .this, .that
[15:39:22] <duch_kazatel> $(this).is('.someClass');
[15:39:22] <z1haze> i want to do differnt things based on that
[15:39:27] <z1haze> perfect thank you
[15:41:53] <duch_kazatel> but i'd ask yourself if they really belong in the same handler at that point.
[15:46:49] <z1haze> how would I use a preload on my whole page until all scripts have been loaded
[15:47:09] <z1haze> They do, the only thing that changes is which element gets removed, they all do exactly the same thing
[15:47:26] <z1haze> its just the html markup is different on 1 of them than the other 3
[15:48:21] <duch_kazatel> wait so then what does the selector have to do anything?
[15:48:38] <duch_kazatel> and the preload is simple - have an overlay div that you hide in a window load handler.
[15:48:54] <z1haze> well the function is to delete a model from my database via ajax and just just remove the element from the dom
[15:49:19] <duch_kazatel> you already have the element you interacted witht hen.
[15:49:21] <duch_kazatel> *with
[15:49:32] <z1haze> in 4 of the elements the structure is exactly the same, however on one of them, i am deleting a something that the markup on the page is a bit different, so i need to just adjust the .remove element
[15:50:11] <z1haze> its just a mtter of this: $(deleteForm).parents('tr').remove(); or this $(deleteForm).remove();
[15:50:29] <z1haze> 4 of them require the tr to be removed, but one doesnt havea table so just remove the form
[15:50:31] <duch_kazatel> 'kay.  sounds weird, but whatever works.
[15:50:50] <z1haze> i kinda hacked it together and it works i just put the tr remove first, and addde the delete form remove after
[15:50:57] <z1haze> figured there was a better way though
[15:51:16] <duch_kazatel> and i'd avoid that preload fwiw.
[15:51:36] <z1haze> it wasnt related
[15:51:45] <duch_kazatel> i wasn't saying it is.
[15:51:48] <z1haze> oh
[15:52:04] <z1haze> let me show you the one function first so you can see what im doing with that
[15:52:05] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/2AX65QH
[15:52:07] <duch_kazatel> but preloads are hacky.
[15:52:40] <duch_kazatel> lines 26/27 are redundant
[15:52:48] <z1haze> thats what i was saying
[15:52:53] <z1haze> wait
[15:53:01] <duch_kazatel> you're already removing a parent element.
[15:53:03] <z1haze> .delete-row applies to 4 out of the 5
[15:53:05] <z1haze> listen..
[15:53:06] <z1haze> lol
[15:53:14] <z1haze> ill be adding .delete-row-image to that selector
[15:53:25] <z1haze> so if its .delete-row-image do the second, if not do the first
[15:53:36] <z1haze> make more sense?
[15:53:54] <duch_kazatel> something about this seems odd but without seeing the markup and everything in action, i'll just trust you ;)
[15:54:14] <z1haze> haha
[15:54:27] <z1haze> its just a generic solution so i dont have to make multiple functions that do basically the same thing
[15:54:37] <z1haze> just imagine the markup for 1 of them is completely different
[15:54:39] <duch_kazatel> yeah something about this just feels strange.
[15:54:48] <duch_kazatel> that's the part that seems weird, but whatevs.
[15:54:48] <z1haze> one of the layouts is a table.. the other is not a table
[15:54:52] <z1haze> haha
[15:54:55] <duch_kazatel> right, that's my issue.
[15:54:58] <duch_kazatel> that seems really unusual.
[15:55:09] <z1haze> example 1: http://puu.sh/kLtTg/bacf5df581.jpg
[15:55:15] <z1haze> basic table
[15:55:19] <z1haze> which i delete the whole row
[15:55:23] <duch_kazatel> sorry i'm not really in the mood to do this right now.
[15:55:30] <duch_kazatel> i've already said it's not a big deal.
[15:55:53] <z1haze> sorry, i just thought you were interested. my bad
[15:56:11] <z1haze> anyway, i guess moving on to the reason why i think i should have a preloader
[15:57:14] <z1haze> i am using appear.js which is basically just a js function to animate elements on to the page as you scroll or whatever, rarely ive noticed that if i reload the page halfway scrolled down, or something like that i get an error for a function not defined.. I was thining its because one script is loading before or another or something
[15:57:53] <duch_kazatel> i'd fix that problem, not band-aid it and require end users to wait.
[15:58:09] <lumidee> hi, how do i get the "neutral" from data-rate attribute? http://jsbin.com/jiruviyoze/edit?html,js,console,output
[15:58:30] <duch_kazatel> .data('rate') lumidee
[15:58:46] <z1haze> duch_kazatel, but i dont really know what to 'fix' it with
[16:00:09] <lumidee> duch_kazatel, ye, i used that syntax :) ... but i have issues with getting to the element that i want the .data('rate') from
[16:00:33] <duch_kazatel> 1 sec.
[16:00:55] <duch_kazatel> z1haze not sure what you want us to do when you aren't showing us the broken code :)
[16:01:08] <duch_kazatel> shit bbiab meeting
[16:01:10] <z1haze> its not broken
[16:01:11] <z1haze> ok
[16:01:15] <duch_kazatel> actually, it is ;)
[16:01:24] <duch_kazatel> if it's erroring and you don't want it to, it's broken :D
[16:01:25] <lumidee> i need to find first the <span> element which contains the string "active" within its classname. i tried:     var $active = $anchor.parent('form').find('*[class*="active"]');
[16:06:19] <shoky_> lumidee: .find('span[class*="active"]')  should find such a span
[16:06:39] <shoky_> pretty nasty use of classes, but it should work
[16:07:31] <shoky_> much nicer to look for such a span that has the class "active",  e.g.  .find('span.active')
[16:13:22] <lumidee> hm, i substituted *[class*="active"] with span[class*="active"] but it still doesn't get the class name: http://jsbin.com/jiruviyoze/edit?html,js,console,output   instead it says: ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[16:14:39] <lumidee> i can't use .active, because i have multiple active classes that have different absolute positions
[16:15:29] <theskillwithin> is there a better way to do this?  http://pastie.org/10484397
[16:19:41] <devslash> I have jquery code that runs a timer on a regular interval. whenever the timer executes,, it makes an ajax call to a php page which returns a chunk of HTML code. I've verified that this HTML is being returned correctly. I want to know inject that to my page. My HTML code is created on the server and is contained within a DIV tag so I remove the div first now I want to add it to my body so I do $('body').append(result)
[16:19:41] <devslash> where result is the HTML payload. When I trace the execution in the dev console it is executing and doesn't seem to display any errors but the HTML table is not visible and when I do view source on my page, there's no indication that my code was actually added. has anyone done something like this before ?
[16:19:50] <lumidee> ah it works actually! my mistake was that i removed $anchor before my code
[16:23:34] <shoky_> lumidee: you know that you can have more than one class on an element, yes?  why not class="neutral active" like a normal person ;)  and then  .find('.active')
[16:24:08] <lumidee> shoky_, heh, i should consider that. thanks for the hint! :)
[16:24:09] <theskillwithin> so I  am useing .toggle()  to hide and show something, how do I  hide the element by default?   displpay: none?
[16:24:10] <shoky_> this also lets you easily add and remove classes , just  .addClass('active')
[16:24:19] <shoky_> or .toggleClass('active')
[16:24:31] <shoky_> instead of manipulating strings like a homeless
[16:26:22] <devslash> has anyone here dynamically loaded HTML content using jQuery
[16:26:41] <tirengarfio> If I have and infinite list of products using ajax and then I scroll down so I call ajax to get new products, and then click on one of them and then go back, the browser should show the new products?
[16:26:59] <tirengarfio> "go back to the list"
[16:28:15] <shoky_> theskillwithin: the proper way is really to give it by default a class like "hidden" that has display:none in the stylesheet, and then do .toggleClass('hidden')
[16:28:37] <shoky_> theskillwithin: that will also ensure your code keeps working in jquery 3 which changed this behaviour a bit
[16:30:24] <theskillwithin> nice
[16:44:46] <lumidee> i appended within $.post.done()    <a class='rated' href='' type='submit' data-rate='eye'>click</a>      but i have to click twice on the dynamically appended anchor until my .on event works for it.
[16:45:22] <lumidee> whereas the docs say that "Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time"   https://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:45:39] <lumidee> not sure what iam doing wrong :)
[16:46:33] <jphase> lumidee: you need to bind to a parent of the dynamically created element and pass the child selector as the second arg of .on
[16:47:10] <jphase> i.e. $('#parent_element').on('click', '.child-class', function() { // stuff here });
[16:47:51] <lumidee> ah, thanks for the hint!
[16:52:29] <lumidee> works flawless now by binding to the parent... going to fix my active classnames now ^
[16:53:44] <Noob_> Can anyone help me with an issue?  I have bootstrap tabs setup and I need to make sure the columns are even in each tab pane.  When the page renders I have areas where the content runs outside the pane.  http://kopy.io/oI9hr
[16:58:47] <jphase> Noob_: do you have a jQuery related question?
[16:58:58] <devslash> has anyone here used jQuery to dynamically load HTML content into a DIV
[16:59:38] <jphase> devslash: yup
[17:00:21] <Noob_> yeah how can I use jQuery to accomplish that
[17:01:19] <jphase> Noob_: I wrote a blog post on width and height equalization (if that's what you're asking about): http://robido.com/jquery/use-jquery-to-match-height-or-width-of-elements-equalize-to-make-them-all-the-same-uniform-height-or-width/
[17:01:39] <jphase> there's a link to a fiddle in there you can play around width
[17:02:57] <Noob_> Thanks jphase
[17:04:37] <jphase> np
[17:10:34] <jak2000> how to add a innerhtml to a <tbody ? after ajax request?
[17:12:10] <jphase> jak2000: $('tbody.your-tbody-classname').html( '<h1>FOOBAR!</h1>' );
[17:12:16] <jphase> just an example, but use .html()
[17:20:06] <anim> Hey folks, I am loading the jquery and all other external files in async in my project. I noticed document.ready isn't triggered until all the images in page have loaded. Is this a known issue?
[17:20:20] <anim> Wanted to check here before creating an issue in the tracker
[17:20:43] <anim> happens with latest 1.X and 2.X
[17:22:10] <taplar> docs say that it waits on the images
[17:23:01] <anim> Does it?
[17:23:16] <anim> " jQuery detects this state of readiness for you. Code included inside $( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready for JavaScript code to execute. Code included inside $( window ).load(function() { ... }) will run once the entire page (images or iframes), not just the DOM, is ready."
[17:23:17] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/ready/ first paragraph
[17:23:46] <snover> that documentation says literally the opposite of what you say it says
[17:24:01] <taplar> 'While JavaScript provides the load event for executing code when a page is rendered, this event does not get triggered until all assets such as images have been completely received.'
[17:24:09] <snover> this event = the load event
[17:24:18] <anim> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[17:24:35] <taplar> well that's oddly worded
[17:25:12] <snover> it is explaining why there is a separate dom ready event that is not the load event
[17:26:03] <taplar> no, i understand that, but 'this' is slightly ambiguous in that statement
[17:27:12] <anim> there have been separate events for a long time
[17:27:26] <anim> but those 2 links have contradictory explanation
[17:27:57] <anim> also document.ready doesn't wait form images to load when jquery is synchronously loaded
[17:28:04] <anim> problem occures when it's loaded in async
[17:30:21] <anim> snover: check the link I shared
[17:30:49] <jquery438> hi guys...
[17:30:52] <jquery438> quick question
[17:31:06] <snover> anim: why?
[17:31:21] <jquery438> does $(document).ready function w8 for js resources to be loaded... or does it fire as soon as dom is loaded?
[17:31:28] <taplar> lmao
[17:31:45] <jquery438> i have a script before closing body tag... and then $(document).ready that uses object from that script
[17:31:47] <snover> sounds like someone is having an intraoffice debate and has brought it to jquery channel
[17:31:55] <taplar> or a troll
[17:32:12] <anim> snover : because it implied .ready doesn't wait for images
[17:32:19] <snover> because it doesn’t.
[17:32:36] <anim> could you explain?
[17:33:49] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=$.ready
[17:33:57] <taplar> have fun
[17:34:03] <snover> anim: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded
[17:34:06] <snover> that is the event
[17:34:54] <anim> ok so you agree it doesn't wait for images?
[17:35:08] <anim> "The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. "
[17:35:34] <snover> that’s right, so why do you think it is?
[17:36:28] <anim> my original question was: when jquery is loaded in async, it does wait for images
[17:37:12] <snover> if you are loading async and your images are already loading filling the network pipeline how do you think jquery can load before your images?
[17:40:05] <anim> snover: I check the network tab in chrome inspector. Jquery is being loaded before the image that is slow
[17:40:17] <anim> I have just one in my test
[17:40:19] <anim> page
[17:42:32] <z1haze> How do I solve a problem where functions are trying to execute on my page before scripts are loaded, causing not defined errors?
[17:42:45] <anim> I set up a demo if you have time: http://jsbin.com/sijawujunu/edit?html,console,output I used the yepnope loader to load scripts
[17:42:49] <snover> don’t try to execute functions before your scripts are loaded.
[17:43:00] <anim> I am not trying that
[17:43:35] <snover> talking to z1haze
[17:43:40] <z1haze> huh?
[17:43:49] <z1haze> oh
[17:43:50] <z1haze> haha
[17:43:53] <z1haze> well thats the idea
[17:43:59] <z1haze> but how do i make that happen?
[17:44:10] <snover> by not doing it?
[17:44:21] <z1haze> ...
[17:44:29] <z1haze> without being a smartass?
[17:44:45] <z1haze> my script src=".... file is sometimes not being loaded before the function is called
[17:45:57] <snover> that isn’t possible unless you are dynamically injecting scripts or are incorrectly using the async attribute
[17:46:02] <z1haze> an example: http://dpaste.com/1CKRBXT
[17:46:07] <snover> scripts execute in order they exist in the dom
[17:46:08] <z1haze> yea probably
[17:46:39] <snover> so if you need them to execute in order don’t use async!! the whole point of async is to allow out of order execution.
[17:46:49] <z1haze> ah
[17:47:06] <snover> anim: i don’t know anything about yepnope except it’s crazy old and there are better module systems like requirejs
[17:47:24] <anim> I tried other loaders too
[17:47:27] <anim> It's not a loder issue
[17:52:06] <snover> anim: you are not correct. http://jsbin.com/nodoxoviqo/1/edit?html,console,output
[17:53:43] <anim> snover: what that jsbin established?
[17:54:01] <snover> the ready callback is invoked before the image loads
[17:54:06] <anim> I know it doesn't wait for the images when jquery is loaded in sync
[17:54:07] <chroma_> I found a typo on the jquery website. How do I report it?
[17:54:13] <anim> which is what you did
[18:00:39] <snover> anim: oh, ok, sorry. so, the dom ready event from the browser has already executed at that point but the readyState for the document has to be "complete" in order for it to fire due to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12282#comment:15
[18:01:22] <snover> the readystate is not "complete" while other resources are still loading, so it becomes a fallback to the load event
[18:01:57] <snover> the fact of the matter is that if you just put all your scripts before </body> then you do not need any ready anything
[18:03:46] <anim> I got disconnected
[18:03:52] <anim> did I miss anything?
[18:03:55] <snover> yes
[18:04:23] <snover> the dom ready event from the browser has already executed at that point but the readyState for the document has to be "complete" in order for it to fire due to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12282#comment:15. The readyState of the document is not "complete" while other resources are still loading, so it becomes a fallback to the load event.

[18:04:29] <snover> so just don’t use it
[18:10:24] <mrtAkdeniz> hey there
[18:10:43] <mrtAkdeniz> is there a way to automatically scroll down iframe with jquery?
[18:11:24] <mrtAkdeniz> i mean think that my iframe has 200 height, but content on iframed page is 600 height, so i want to scroll it automatically by time to show every content
[18:11:43] <alejandrop555> hello
[18:11:52] <mrtAkdeniz> is there a command or function for that, or should i use javascript?
[18:14:03] <taplar> mrtAkdeniz, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1192228/scrolling-an-iframe-with-javascript
[18:15:46] <anim> thanks snover :)
[18:17:51] <mrtAkdeniz> taplar, firstly, it does "goes to wanted height of iframe" , i asked for something scrolling.. secondly i asked for jquery mate, not javascript.. i don't want to write javascript, that's why i asked here. anyway; thanks for your reply!
[18:19:31] <taplar> if you can go to a specific point then you can animate that
[18:19:37] <taplar> and jquery is javascript
[18:20:39] <taplar> if you don't want to write raw javascript it just takes some tinkering to turn it into jquery
[18:26:37] <printForever> recommendation on a tabs plugin?
[18:26:48] <printForever> iPad is a primary concern
[18:26:53] <johndoe2> Hello there, how do I handle a conflict for the $ variable? jQuery.noconflict() doesn't seem to make a difference.
[18:27:57] <taplar> did you do noconflict or noConflict?
[18:29:07] <johndoe2> so sorry, typo, the capitalization should be correct: jQuery.noConflict();
[18:30:27] <taplar> and your saying after that, '$' still references jQuery?
[18:30:53] <printForever> any suggestions for tabs plugin?
[18:31:09] <taplar> printForever, did you look at the jquery ui tabs?
[18:32:10] <printForever> yes
[18:32:15] <printForever> but I need something without styles
[18:32:25] <printForever> and iOS friendly
[18:32:34] <johndoe2> Ok, so noConflict just makes jQuery drop control for the $...
[18:32:39] <taplar> yes
[18:32:50] <johndoe2> then I'm asking the wrong question.
[18:35:17] <johndoe2> Thank you taplar, it's most likely user error, going to re-check my code.
[18:35:30] <taplar> gl
[18:40:18] <acidjazz> gs
[18:47:54] <Pazician> Hello everyone. I've a WordPress theme that allows people to attach a video to their post. What I want now is, I want to get the paragraph(s) after the video element, but I've honestly a really hard time to figure out how to do it. I tried something like this: http://pastebin.com/x7nkJRy3
[18:48:48] <taplar> does your selector match anything?
[18:49:19] <Pazician> taplar: Yes, the selector is targeting the right one I think
[18:49:32] <taplar> did you console log to make sure the length is > 0?
[18:50:16] <Pazician> No, I haven't done that - how should I write the console.log to check that?
[18:50:36] <taplar> console.log( $(whateverSelector).length );
[18:50:48] <Pazician> I'll try that, thanks
[18:51:13] <taplar> if you do get > 0 then you can do the same for the internal $(this).next() to see what it's finding
[18:51:50] <Pazician> I get nothing when doing this: console.log($('#videos .post-wrap .wp-video').length);
[18:52:02] <taplar> you don't get zero?
[18:52:09] <Pazician> No, it's all blank
[18:52:16] <taplar> then that logic is not even executing
[18:52:44] <Pazician> I tried even outside the .each function
[18:52:55] <taplar> yeah, that would need to be outside the each
[18:53:15] <Pazician> Oh, yeah I get a 3
[18:53:21] <Pazician> Not 0, but 3
[18:53:26] <taplar> ok, so it's matching
[18:53:34] <Pazician> Yep, seems like it
[18:53:36] <taplar> now in the each console log your $(this).next()
[18:54:14] <Pazician> I get 3 of them: [prevObject: n.fn.init[1], context: div.wp-video]
[18:54:41] <taplar> hmm
[18:55:05] <taplar> console.log( $(this).next().prop('outerHTML'));
[18:55:25] <Pazician> Inside the .each function?
[18:55:28] <taplar> yep
[18:55:36] <Pazician> I get nothing
[18:55:45] <Pazician> Oh, 3 undefined
[18:55:48] <taplar> so the next isn't returning anything
[18:56:06] <taplar> what does your html structure look like?
[18:57:09] <Pazician> It generating by WP, I hope you can go by an image: http://puu.sh/kLGf4/44b8b11305.png
[18:58:27] <taplar> and all three are undefined?  it doesn't print out a string for a p at all?
[18:59:46] <Pazician> This is what it looks like: http://puu.sh/kLGoy/dcd378118a.png with this code: http://pastebin.com/dPcMNLdj
[19:00:20] <taplar> oh, lol
[19:00:29] <taplar> do the console before you try to move it dummy, :P
[19:00:40] <Pazician> Hehe...
[19:01:01] <Pazician> Now I get this: http://puu.sh/kLGv4/abffd66987.png
[19:01:13] <taplar> ok, so that looks right
[19:01:40] <taplar> but your thinking something is not working as you expect it to?
[19:03:46] <Pazician> Kind off, just the empty paragraph I've no idea why it's there. Yeah, right it's not really moving after the element .wp-video - it seems all through work out when I use insertBefore, but I want them underneath the element called .wp-video
[19:04:09] <taplar> uh, they start out under neath it
[19:04:19] <taplar> or wait
[19:05:05] <taplar> do you mean you want them as the last element inside the .wp-video?
[19:05:45] <Pazician> No, the paragraph(s) should just get underneath the .wp-video
[19:05:54] <Pazician> Not above it
[19:06:26] <taplar> ok, so i'm confused.  next() gets the next element after the .wp-video.  your then moving it to be above the .wp-video, but your saying you don't want that
[19:06:58] <Pazician> Hmm... So maybe I should use .find('p') instead of .next()?
[19:07:44] <taplar> i'm still not sure what your trying to do.  you say you want the paragraph to be below the wp-video, but it already is, without any logic moving it
[19:09:24] <Pazician> No, since if the user in the post adds some text above the attached video media file, it'll add the paragraph above the .wp-video, but if it's so, I want using jQuery move the paragraph(s) underneath the .wp-video - are you following me?
[19:09:36] <taplar> ah
[19:09:39] <taplar> then not next()
[19:09:42] <taplar> previous() maybe
[19:09:51] <taplar> then insertAfter
[19:10:42] <Pazician> I get this error: Uncaught TypeError: $(...).previous is not a function
[19:10:56] <taplar> what about prev()?  *goes to the docs*
[19:11:14] <taplar> yeah, they abbreviated that
[19:11:49] <Pazician> Yeah, lol it worked but it just moves the first paragraphs, what about if I've like 3 paragraph it will then just move the first one
[19:12:01] <taplar> ok try this
[19:12:15] <taplar> $(this).parent().find('p').insertAfter($(this));
[19:13:05] <Pazician> Cool, it's working out just as I want it! Big thank you!
[19:13:11] <taplar> :)
[19:35:52] <Pazician> Why do I get an error like this, all through I've check the network tab, and everything is loaded: Uncaught TypeError: $(...).isotope is not a function This is my code: http://pastebin.com/BGTG6LNe
[19:37:25] <taplar> make sure your including the plugin before that
[19:38:31] <Pazician> Yeah, it's in this order: jQuery-lib, Masonry and then my script
[20:23:08] <Audlex> whats wrong with this? it keeps triggering if it has class 'second'
[20:23:08] <Audlex> if (!$('.scrollLast .sectionBackground').hasClass('second') && viewport >= $('.scrollLast').offset().top) {
[20:37:44] <dna113p> Technically using cheerio for node and not jquery, but I can't get a response there. I'm trying to do this $('$formID').serializeArray(). But what i'm finding is that a bunch of my form elements, which all have name/values and are not disabled do not get included. Looking at $('$formID').html() ... none of those children elements are included. I can't figure out why
[20:38:40] <taplar> if it's similar to jquery then your selector is wrong
[20:38:48] <taplar> id lookups start with #
[20:40:51] <dna113p> taplar: Yeah that was a typo I am using #. And actually I just tried the same command in a browser and it worked fine... who knows... it's like 3 table rows are just disapearing
[20:41:05] <dna113p> so probably a problem with cheerio and not jquery
[20:49:48] <F^3> How do I get the current FormData instance of a form?
[20:52:32] <F^3> Alternatively what's the best way to insert a blob into my form and submit it as a file?
[20:57:17] <snover> F^3: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData
[20:57:18] <taplar> you can access the files off of the element with the type="file" using the prop('files')
[20:58:15] <F^3> taplar, The file is generated from the app. Is it possible to assign a FormData to be used during submission automatically? GravityForm doesn't let me hook into the submission function.
[20:59:32] <taplar> not sure
[20:59:59] <F^3> I was really hoping I could just append an input type='file' and assign the blob to it
[21:00:07] <taplar> no
[21:00:15] <taplar> from my experience, only the browser can attach a file to a form
[21:00:24] <snover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/append
[21:00:35] <snover> are we just ignoring me tonight?
[21:01:15] <taplar> formData.append('userpic[]', myFileInput1.files[0], 'chris1.jpg');
[21:01:29] <taplar> but to get that files to actually be loaded, i believe the browser has to do that
[21:01:46] <taplar> you can move them, remove them if you want though
[21:02:17] <F^3> That's what I'm using. FormData initialized via var formData = new FormData(this); (called from a $().submit()); It's still not getting posted.
[21:03:01] <snover> did you actually prevent the event default action and then send the formdata to an xhr object?
[21:03:17] <snover> submit event*
[21:05:55] <F^3> snover, If I prevent the default submission it won't trigger the GF logic and the page won't change
[21:09:10] <taplar> and your form has the input type="file" in it?
[21:09:12] <snover> sounds like maybe you should stop using that then :)
[21:09:49] <F^3> taplar, I removed the input prior to trying to assign the formdata
[21:10:06] <taplar> so the form would not submit the file
[21:10:33] <snover> could you please restate what you are trying to do and not what you think the right way is to do it?
[21:11:33] <snover> and by restate, i mean, say it for the first time since you just asked about formdata and never mentioned anything else
[21:13:21] <F^3> snover, I want to submit a blob as a file (audio/wav) that's created via a getuserMedia stream during form submission. I can't prevent the default submission routine due to how GravityForm works.
[21:20:08] <snover> F^3: The HTML specification does not allow the value of a file input to be set programmatically to anything except empty string, not even to a URL created by URL.createObjectURL. Maybe you could use FileReader#readAsDataURL(blob) and then put the URL in a hidden field.
[21:20:21] <snover> Hope your server streams request data body.
[21:21:03] <HowardwLo> howdy! i am seriously stuck on a problem and can’t figure out why. http://jsfiddle.net/ad6mnvm1/  click on first input, type something, then quickly click on second input. it logs the first input twice
[21:21:31] <snover> otherwise you have to stop using the thing you are using and pick something less bad.
[21:23:36] <HowardwLo> anyone? :D
[21:23:48] <HowardwLo> i think it has somethign to do with the delay
[21:23:54] <taplar> HowardwLo, i'm having trouble recreating what your saying is happening
[21:24:29] <HowardwLo> taplar: erm hmm
[21:25:03] <HowardwLo> taplar: can you try clicking right after you finish typing the first input field?
[21:25:48] <taplar> i select the first one, move my mouse over the second one.  type 'aaa' and as soon as it have the third a done i click
[21:26:40] <HowardwLo> yup
[21:26:42] <HowardwLo> taplar: http://snag.gy/xl3jI.jpg
[21:26:42] <taplar> to which i see someting like: aaaaaaaaaaaa name
[21:26:44] <HowardwLo> here is my screenshot
[21:27:07] <HowardwLo> for me i get two aaaaaaaa
[21:27:09] <taplar> is it that name part your talking about
[21:27:13] <taplar> ah
[21:27:22] <HowardwLo> aaaaa name aaaaa name
[21:27:35] <HowardwLo> but it sohuld be aaaaa name + <whatever in email> email
[21:27:41] <taplar> for shiggles, what browser?
[21:27:45] <HowardwLo> chrome
[21:27:50] <taplar> k, hold on
[21:27:56] <HowardwLo> <3
[21:28:20] <Horacsio> some help solving this: http://jsfiddle.net/a49gq1h9/2/
[21:28:30] <Horacsio> I need a two state button.
[21:28:50] <taplar> HowardwLo, same in chrome for me, :(
[21:28:53] <Horacsio> one to be called after the first one has run
[21:29:31] <HowardwLo> taplar: ya, i don’t know why
[21:29:45] <HowardwLo> is it because that function is called while it’s waiting for a delay?
[21:29:53] <HowardwLo> i mean, called again while the first onei s waiting for a delay
[21:30:58] <taplar> HowardwLo, i assume this is attempting to put in a throttle/debounce, whatever it's called
[21:31:28] <HowardwLo> taplar: thats a little above my level, whats that mean?
[21:31:59] <taplar> it means to prevent an action from happening until a certain amount of time has passed from the last event of a certain type
[21:33:44] <taplar> HowardwLo, http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[21:33:45] <HowardwLo> oh
[21:33:51] <taplar> see if anything in there is useful to you
[21:34:35] <HowardwLo> i should probably mention i didn’t write that code :D
[21:34:41] <taplar> Horacsio, so click it once, it does action A, click it again it does action B, wash rinse repeat?
[21:35:19] <Horacsio> taplar: sorry about my english: what you mean with wash rinse repeat? :S
[21:35:33] <taplar> do the same steps over and over and over
[21:35:54] <taplar> or simply 'repeat sequence'
[21:36:02] <HowardwLo> taplar: wait, it shouldn’t be waiting because you clicked out of the input field. it should trigger the focusout event?
[21:36:28] <taplar> HowardwLo, it didn't appear to, no, but you could have both a debounce and blur binding
[21:37:04] <taplar> your logic in the debounce would just cancel if the element was not in focus anymore
[21:38:34] <HowardwLo> taplar: so my debounce is….the keyup function?
[21:38:59] <taplar> or input
[21:39:47] <Horacsio> taplar: I need it like a two state button
[21:39:47] <HowardwLo> so to fix it, I need to remove the debounce? sorry im a bit lost
[21:40:11] <Horacsio> so I addClass to remove it later.
[21:40:27] <taplar> when you click it the second time
[21:40:32] <Horacsio> yes
[21:40:55] <Horacsio> do I need to count clicks?
[21:41:05] <taplar> no, hold on
[21:48:24] <derekZero_> When you use animate like this: $('div').animate({left:'+=10px'}, 500);. What does the 500 do?
[21:50:53] <taplar> Horacsio, http://jsfiddle.net/a49gq1h9/4/
[21:51:11] <taplar> derekZero_, that number is the duration i believe
[21:51:31] <derekZero_> Like miliseconds it takes the image to move?
[21:51:36] <taplar> yep
[21:52:08] <derekZero_> thx
[21:53:22] <taplar> HowardwLo, ok, so from that page this line: $('input:text').keyup( $.debounce( 250, ajax_lookup ) );
[21:53:38] <taplar> you could do that
[21:53:58] <taplar> but for your immediate blur one you'd need a blur binding that also does the same thing
[21:55:24] <Horacsio> shit, so easy :S :( thank you!
[21:55:45] <taplar> HowardwLo,  $('input:text').blur( ajax_lookup );
[21:55:48] <Horacsio> why do I need: function(e) and e.preventDefault();?
[21:56:04] <taplar> to stop the attempt at a page transition with the link
[21:56:37] <taplar> ah, but since your doing href="#" you don't need it
[21:56:41] <Horacsio> thank you taplar :)
[22:03:35] <HowardwLo> taplar: so i got to put a debounce within .on and a .blur .on focusout?
[22:04:19] <taplar> blur is focusout
[22:04:55] <HowardwLo> oh
[22:05:03] <HowardwLo> so you mean, debounce on both keyup and focus out
[22:05:27] <taplar> just the debounce, since you want the action to happen immediately if they do focus out right?
[22:05:37] <HowardwLo> right….
[22:05:38] <taplar> err, just the keyup
[22:06:55] <taplar> may be ugly but i'll see if i can get a fiddle going
[22:07:06] <HowardwLo> so i just wrap the callback of keyup/keypress with debounce? like this? http://jsfiddle.net/ad6mnvm1/1/
[22:12:58] <algun> name a function that has an alias
[22:13:12] <taplar> ajax
[22:13:36] <taplar> jQuery
[22:13:54] <taplar> addClass, removeClass
[22:13:58] <taplar> etc...
[22:14:20] <algun> taplar: what's the alias for ajax?
[22:14:30] <taplar> $.post, $.get
[22:14:41] <taplar> though you could argue those are wrappers
[22:14:52] <taplar> but $ would be an alias for jQuery
[22:15:03] <algun> i would argue precisely that :)
[22:15:35] <librarryy> can someone explain, I don't understand at all: "Primitives will be wrapped to objects" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign
[22:17:31] <algun> taplar: so other than $ is there really any aliases?
[22:18:49] <taplar> not really that i can think of right now.
[22:18:58] <algun> i know one that is not a function, and it's undocumented
[22:19:29] <algun> i thought maybe there's a template for aliases, that's why i was asking
[22:19:35] <taplar> well, $() can be an 'alias' for $(document).ready()
[22:19:53] <taplar> but that's kinda fuzzy
[22:20:04] <taplar> lot is involved with $(), :)
[22:20:24] <taplar> HowardwLo, btw, not forgotten you.  still fiddling
[22:20:47] <HowardwLo> taplar: :D thanks, i’m trying to figure out debounce on my end
[22:21:21] <algun> Though what i'm thinking of isn't strictly jQuery, it's Sizzle (you've inferred it, it's a selector). Start guessing!
[22:22:30] <algun> I've got one more hint if you want, before I reveal the answer.
[22:23:26] <algun> 'tis a silly game i guess
[22:23:47] <taplar> it's 9pm for me, on the verge of crashing.  no games, plz, :D
[22:24:53] <taplar> HowardwLo, ok here's an example with the debounce and blur  http://jsfiddle.net/xj0vk95o/
[22:25:21] <taplar> it still has the issue of if the blur or debounce happens, the other will still happen.  but my brain is about dead, X|
[22:25:29] <HowardwLo> taplar: whoa jesus
[22:25:35] <taplar> that's the plugin
[22:25:44] <taplar> i couldn't find a cdn so i pulled it from the git repo
[22:26:08] <taplar> here is the git repo btw https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-throttle-debounce
[22:26:54] <HowardwLo> taplar: so this is my code using their plugin?
[22:27:01] <taplar> pretty much
[22:27:18] <taplar> without the exclusion though like i said
[22:27:22] <taplar> still needs tinkering for that
[22:27:46] <HowardwLo> taplar: is it easier to use their plugin to achieve the exclusion or my own?
[22:28:54] <taplar> uh, not sure.  i mean you did have yours working right?  minus that one thing i couldn't reproduce.  so in that sense yours was closer to what you wanted.  but also at the same time, it was kinda reinventing a wheel.  but, *shrug* whatever you can get to work right?
[22:29:19] <HowardwLo> ya mine was working besides that one little edge case, and it was bugging the shit out of me
[22:29:56] <HowardwLo> i ask cause i’m not very comfortable with jQuery and not sure which one i should go with
[22:30:02] <taplar> heh, so yeah.  maybe play around with the debounce, and yours and probably come back in tomorrow and ask again about yours.  lots of others that know more than me
[22:30:17] <HowardwLo> kk, thanks
[22:31:03] <taplar> anyway, night all
[22:35:19] <DigitalFire> To get 'artisan' to create model folders in a custom location by default. Do you need to do anything other than specify the location in the class map?
[22:37:42] <tash> If I have more than one thing with the following id's on my page, how can I get more than just the first one to toggle?  Right now that is the behavior, only the first instance of content-body-container is toggled http://pastebin.com/WBRh53t9
[22:41:30] <algun> tash: you mustn't have more than one thing with the same id
[22:42:50] <tash> will it work the correct way if I use class instead of id?
[22:44:01] <algun> unless each is in its own shadow dom i guess, but then you can't select them both at the same time anyway i think
[22:44:41] <algun> tash: classes are denoted with a dot instead of the she/pound/hash sign
[22:45:34] <tash> yeah, I understand that.  I just have multiple things styled the same way on the same page that I want to toggle =\
[22:46:08] <algun> yes, multiple elements can have the same class, hence the name class (as opposed to id) :P
[22:46:26] <tash> lol
[22:46:46] <tash> in hindsight, I'm not sure why this code is styling things ( many things ) with # instead of .
[22:47:07] <tash> can't remember if I wrote it or not, most of this stuff was inherited
[22:51:05] <algun> a fun fact which i've only recently noticed is that things with ids exist as objects in the global namespace. That is, you don't need to select for them via $('#id'), you can save whole 3 characters and write $(id), because id variable already has the node (unless overridden aka shaddowed).
[22:52:09] <Horacsio> why my variables aren’t working: http://jsfiddle.net/2y2k1fnv/
[22:53:18] <algun> tash: btw it seems in the code you're adding a class(well id, but now you know better) *and* toggling an element. If all elements with that same class should be hidden, rather than toggling, just add to css .title-border { display: none }, and whatever has that class will be hidden for as long as it has it.
[22:58:13] <tash> actually what I want is for which ever content-title-container I click on ... I want to toggle *it's* content-body-container.  I don't want to toggle every content-body-container
[22:58:20] <tash> I should probably create a fiddle to help explain
[22:58:30] <tash> b/c I don't think words are helping get out what I want
[23:00:35] <algun> Horacsio: you are aware that you're asking if *any* of the selected elements (ie those with that class) are visible/invisible, right?
[23:00:50] <Horacsio> algun: yes :S
[23:01:22] <Horacsio> but… it’s not checking!
[23:01:26] <algun> i don't see why you'd want to do that..
[23:02:36] <algun> tash: you want $(event.target).toggle(); inside the event handler that you pass to click, provided its second (i think) argument is called event
[23:03:36] <algun> tash: no, its first
[23:04:29] <Horacsio> algun
[23:05:00] <Horacsio> I’m trying to check if one is hidden, and any others are visible
[23:06:25] <algun> tash: actually, `$(id).click(function(){$(this).toggle();});` is sufficient
[23:09:22] <algun> Horacsio: i don't know what your situation is, you posted no html. All I can tell you is that you're asking if any of a bunch of elements with a bunch of (partially overlapping) classes are visible in one place, and invisible in the other
[23:10:54] <tash> algun: I created the fiddle piror to seeing your last comment. I'd like to share ... http://jsfiddle.net/43u7o729/
[23:13:26] <algun> tash: you've made no modifications apart from the class instead of ids
[23:14:29] <pokergod> if i do $('form').find('page') and it cannot be found.  I want to insert the page.  What is the proper way to do this?
[23:14:45] <algun> tash: ask yourself why you're toggling a class for an element that is being hidden. Then apply my last suggestion (with the `this` keyword)
[23:17:42] <algun> tash: actually, describe what you want to do
[23:17:50] <tash> algun, I'm sorry I'm not following. ... when you click on Notes in my fiddle, I want the content just under the Notes tab to be toggled/hidden ... likewise, if you click on Unsubmitted COs I want only it's content to be toggled/hidden
[23:18:08] <algun> tash: ah, that's not what your code was doing
[23:18:09] <tash> however, if you click on either, you'll see that both body's of content get hidden/toggled
[23:18:50] <algun> i see nothing toggled
[23:19:07] <algun> wait
[23:19:09] <tash> really?
[23:19:14] <tash> when I click on it, stuff gets toggled
[23:19:31] <algun> what magic is this
[23:19:41] <tash> dark magic
[23:20:04] <tash> idk, I'm not sure what you mean ... what happens when you click on "Notes"?
[23:20:18] <algun> aaaah
[23:20:30] <algun> i didn't even notice the body class
[23:20:34] <algun> i thought they were both title
[23:20:39] <tash> ah
[23:20:44] <tash> I'm terrible at explaining
[23:20:57] <tash> if you click on "Unsubmitted COs" or "Notes" they do the same thing.
[23:21:07] <tash> But, I want to only toggle the stuff just below one or the other
[23:21:11] <tash> does that make sense?
[23:21:37] <algun> no, i understand now
[23:21:40] <algun> i'm just thinking
[23:21:54] <tash> :)
[23:21:58] <algun> as you've noticed, the class selector selects everything with the given class
[23:22:02] <algun> not just the immediate sibling node
[23:22:27] <algun> wait, let me check your html again
[23:22:50] <tash> the html is a crappy copy/paste from an inspection with firebug ... sorry about that
[23:24:01] <algun> you're using tables, and that prevents us from creating a div around both table and body. So we can't have *it* change class, and the child body be hidden. That way's off.
[23:24:49] <algun> One other hack on the top of my head is that you get the index of the element that is clicked in the list of elements with the class content-body-container
[23:25:19] <algun> Then you toggle the element with the same index in the list of elements with the content-body-container class
[23:25:38] <tash> hmm
[23:25:38] <algun> sorry, that first class should read title not body, like the second
[23:25:51] <tash> so confused =\ lol
[23:25:55] <algun> tash: as i've hinted to before, you have `this`
[23:26:10] <algun> `this` inside an event handler is whatever caused the event
[23:26:33] <algun> (JS is weird so take this with a grain of salt in the most general case)
[23:27:00] <algun> but anyway, what I propose is that you find out from the list of elements with the class content-title-container, which one is === this
[23:27:37] <algun> if it's eg. the 2nd, then you take the second element of the list of elements with the other class (content-body-container) and toggle that one element
[23:28:01] <tash> ok
[23:28:04] <tash> thanks I'll give it a shot
[23:29:46] <algun> tash: the method is conveniently called index, so what you want is $('.content-title-container').index(this)
[23:30:42] <algun> and i'll leave it to you to get the element of the same index from $('.content-body-container')
[23:31:24] <algun> remember, it won't be just [i] or something, because that'll give you a node, and if you want the toggle method, you want a jQuery object containing the node
[23:31:28] <algun> tash: ^
