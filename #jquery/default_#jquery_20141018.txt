[05:50:09] <frank_o> Hi! I'm using `clone().children().remove().end().text()` to check if a paragraph (and none of its nested child tags) contain text: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/td8t4gpv/ -- but how do I get it to ignore whitespace? Right now it seems to give false positives due to indents.
[05:51:35] <JohnGrates> could someone explain to me why this is running 5 times? http://jsfiddle.net/83bvu2Lk/
[05:51:41] <JohnGrates> please :)
[05:57:44] <JohnGrates> anyone got any ideas?
[06:41:04] <frank_o> doug_: Any idea why `afterText` returns false positives? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/35/ -- I believe that's essentially the only thing left.
[06:41:07] <frank_o> doug_: After that I can start extending this thing to support arbitrary occurrances of YouTubes and texts.
[06:51:36] <funkt> http://jsfiddle.net/Firewiredesign/jhLb0u2m/3/ Hi there I am trying to get the heading right to move to the centre on this - Can anyone help have I written this correctly I can get both to either move to the left or right but not right or left??
[06:58:22] <frank_o> funkt: What the hell are you trying to do?
[06:58:46] <frank_o> funkt: Have you looked into https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js + CSS3 animations?
[06:59:08] <funkt> looks very complicated
[06:59:28] <funkt> I just want to move this heading to the left and right on scroll
[06:59:40] <funkt> I'm nearly there!
[06:59:51] <funkt> so they meet up in the centre
[07:02:22] <funkt> any ideas frank_o?

[07:17:20] <frank_o> I have no idea what you're trying to do though, I just reused an old example of mine

[07:17:46] <funkt> thank you very much frank_o thats very kind!
[07:18:16] <funkt> more of what decx has produced is what I was trying to achieve for the end result!

[09:50:28] <OnceMe> what it do young fellas
[09:50:35] <OnceMe> I have one small issue
[09:51:16] <OnceMe> I have div display=none and I load cover in there and on profile picture image on hover I show that hidden block, however that requires additional load of images in background, so I wish to rewrite that in jQuery so on hover it loads cover picture, how to do that?
[09:54:40] <OnceMe> help me please all
[09:54:46] <OnceMe> BinaryKitten: ~~~
[09:55:24] <frank_o> OnceMe: You could just put all your images in a CSS sprite
[09:55:29] <frank_o> I guess
[09:56:26] <OnceMe> frank_o: what?
[09:56:31] <OnceMe> No, I have cover picture like facebook
[09:56:39] <OnceMe> so I want to pull up pic in container on profile pic hover
[09:56:47] <OnceMe> I already have css sprites for a website and that is fine
[09:57:39] <frank_o> Oh ok
[09:59:54] <frank_o> OnceMe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4285042/can-jquery-ajax-load-image maybe idk =/
[10:00:32] <OnceMe> no its not
[10:02:16] <frank_o> OnceMe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21712958/pre-load-jquery-hover-images
[10:04:26] <frank_o> OnceMe: im not really sure what you're trying to do but if you throw up a testcase (ie. http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) it'd be much easier to help
[10:05:04] <guy> So, what happened to plugin.jquery.com?
[10:05:13] <guy> s
[10:07:23] <seaders> Hey guys, can anyone help with a few collapsible header questions? https://forum.jquery.com/topic/collapsible-headers-in-a-table-and-style-it-like-a-regular-header
[10:50:47] <RWOverdijk> Okay so... Here's a weird question. I'd provide context but it's difficult to extract a sample from my code. Anyway, I am initialising a popver (twitter bootstrap) on a newly created node (based on selection, converted to anchor tag). This doesn't work. It doesn't show the popover when I specify $node.popover('show');. However, if I place this exact code above it, it _does_ work. And it just baffles me. console.log('Equality check',
[10:50:47] <RWOverdijk>  ttt[0] === $node[0], ttt, $node); ttt is a variable I made global for testing purposes, but it's basically this: https://gist.github.com/RWOverdijk/48d6ae99e78825b9d6a9 and $node should be the exact same element (extracted using the selection start of current text selection).
[10:51:44] <RWOverdijk> So long story short, given that ttt is a jquery object referencing a DOM node, and $node is, too, what magic does this code: "console.log('Equality check', ttt[0] === $node[0], ttt, $node);" execute to make it work.
[10:54:59] <OnceMe> ayo how can I cgeck if strig starts with id:
[10:55:09] <OnceMe> if (string.startwith("id")) { //true }
[10:55:10] <OnceMe> ?
[10:55:43] <RWOverdijk> string.search(/^id/) === 0
[10:55:46] <RWOverdijk> uhr
[10:55:49] <RWOverdijk> 'id'
[10:55:50] <RWOverdijk> :p
[10:57:08] <OnceMe> thank you homie
[10:57:12] <OnceMe> and my homie BillCriswell just joined in ~:
[10:57:13] <OnceMe> :O
[10:57:32] <RWOverdijk> OnceMe, if (string.match(/^id/)) {} or .search('id') === 0
[10:57:46] <BillCriswell> ayyy
[10:58:26] <OnceMe> ok
[10:58:28] <OnceMe> how can I parse
[10:58:30] <OnceMe> id: 123
[10:58:33] <OnceMe> I want to get only 123
[10:58:34] <OnceMe> how?
[10:59:42] <OnceMe> RWOverdijk: BillCriswell
[10:59:43] <BillCriswell> var s = 'id: 123'; s.slice(s.indexOf(':') + 1).trim();
[11:00:14] <BillCriswell> or s.match(/\d+$/)
[11:00:29] <BillCriswell> or s.match(/\d+$/)[0]
[11:01:45] <RWOverdijk> parseInt()
[11:01:55] <RWOverdijk> oh
[11:01:56] <RWOverdijk> nm
[11:02:28] <RWOverdijk> 'id: 123'.replace(/[^\d]+/g, '')
[11:02:31] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to extract YouTube thumbnails from this paragraph -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/36/ -- but can anyone tell why `if(afterText)` is returning false positives? `if(beforeText)` works just fine.
[11:02:37] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: That's a weird string to have, why do you have it like that?
[11:02:49] <RWOverdijk> OnceMe, ^
[11:03:24] <frank_o> * YouTube thumbnails (including any text that may follow)
[11:03:26] <OnceMe> I am weird man
[11:03:40] <OnceMe> also $('some').show().text(id); does not work why?
[11:04:03] <BillCriswell> some isn't a valid selector unless you have <some> elements.
[11:04:28] <OnceMe> I have .some
[11:04:29] <OnceMe> my bad
[11:05:27] <OnceMe> nvm works now all
[11:05:30] <OnceMe> You all rock
[11:05:40] <OnceMe> Im going to be a millionaire and donate money to you guys
[11:06:10] <frank_o> OnceMe: be better if you threw a huge party and invited us all
[11:06:21] <frank_o> paid for our flights
[11:06:22] <OnceMe> and pay you a flight over here
[11:06:26] <OnceMe> or make it
[11:06:30] <frank_o> gave us free food, booze, weed and women
[11:06:30] <OnceMe> I thought bout that too
[11:06:33] <OnceMe> make it in LV
[11:06:35] <OnceMe> no weed
[11:06:39] <OnceMe> we only make legal stuff
[11:34:36] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/x3ubh8vs/ <--- why does this alert on numbers too?
[11:37:14] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Do you only wan them entering 0-9 ?
[11:37:25] <BillCriswell> Cause isNumeric allows a lot more than just that.
[11:37:37] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: yep
[11:38:01] <BillCriswell> Also, use input instead of keyup. keyup runs on EVERY key up, input runs on keyups that actually change the value.
[11:38:11] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: should I use isNan?
[11:40:45] <alaing> yellow
[11:40:46] <BillCriswell> I'd probably just use simple regex and look for any number.
[11:41:10] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/x3ubh8vs/1/ <--- this doesn't work
[11:41:52] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: I don't need that, I just need to check if the user inputs an alphanumeric
[11:42:16] <BillCriswell> They why "numbers only"?
[11:42:32] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: phone number
[11:42:55] <BillCriswell> so you're allowing phone numbers with letters?
[11:43:36] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: let me rephrase, I need to make sure user doesn't input a non-digit
[11:43:53] <BillCriswell> alpha numeric would include the alphabet.
[11:48:18] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/x3ubh8vs/4/
[11:48:37] <BillCriswell> and it should hopefully be obvious what to remove if you don't want to allow letters.
[12:09:14] <blackkbot> integers only? im way late
[12:10:40] <Alina-malina> i have like 6-7MB of text data that i want to display on page with scroll down and ajax, will browser cash will handle that data?
[12:11:12] <blackkbot> cache? depends on how you do the ajax
[12:11:32] <Alina-malina> i want that all 6MB of data be displayed inside browser
[12:11:40] <Alina-malina> yes cache:)
[12:12:17] <Alina-malina> it is like 100000 sha256() strings
[12:12:32] <doug_> Alina-malina: 6MB will be hard on the browser. does you browser behave ok if you view the page on your machine?
[12:13:25] <doug_> I would expect sluggishness with a page that big. unfortunately
[12:13:32] <blackkbot> yeah its all depending on the system but ive loaded way more than 6 mb in a browser... but why would you want to cache something so big that is static?
[12:14:46] <doug_> Alina-malina: it's not displayed to the user? It's a huge ajax "lookup table" block of data?
[12:14:58] <Alina-malina> yes it needs to be showed to user
[12:15:04] <Alina-malina> it is like username:sha256()
[12:15:08] <Alina-malina> well i can do pagination
[12:15:20] <Alina-malina> i am just wondering what amount of data i should serve on page, so browser handle it?
[12:15:23] <Alina-malina> 1MB?
[12:15:26] <Alina-malina> 200KB?
[12:15:28] <Alina-malina> how much?
[12:16:01] <doug_> Alina-malina: test it with your real workload and see
[12:16:05] <Alina-malina> oh
[12:16:11] <Alina-malina> hmm alright:)
[12:16:19] <Alina-malina> thanks for pointing me direction
[12:17:28] <Alina-malina> doug_, what otherways i can use beside pagination and scrolling down? maybe export that list into pdf and let them just to download it?
[12:17:31] <Alina-malina> :-/
[12:18:07] <Alina-malina> maybe some kind of slideshow?
[12:18:19] <Alina-malina> i mean slider so they could just tap with finger?
[12:18:24] <Alina-malina> or mouse
[12:19:00] <Alina-malina> or titles? like at the end of the movies? will that work?
[12:19:29] <doug_> Alina-malina: why is it 6mb? is it something they would search?
[12:19:47] <NeedSomeHelp> Hey where is the syntax error ? http://pastie.org/9659617
[12:20:15] <Alina-malina> yes, they need to make sure that it is valid and anyone have access to that data, it is like proof of work so it needs to be open for every user on website
[12:20:23] <blackkbot> line 25 NeedSomeHelp
[12:20:27] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/x3ubh8vs/5/ <---is this a correct usage?
[12:20:47] <Velveeta> damn, blackkbot beat me to it
[12:21:31] <Velveeta> kartagis: i'm not sure what you're trying to do there...
[12:22:16] <Kartagis> Velveeta: define a function, then use that with different inputs
[12:22:54] <NeedSomeHelp> blackbot: thanks, a comma too much.
[12:23:02] <ncls> hello
[12:23:24] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: $.getJSON("/countries", {term: request.term}).done(function() { response(country); }).fail(function() { alert("Sorry, there was a problem!"); })
[12:23:27] <ncls> I want to get the first "input" element of some html content I loaded via an Ajax request, how can I do that ?
[12:23:37] <doug_> oh look your whole thing fit in a couple of lines :D
[12:23:57] <doug_> source thing*
[12:24:18] <Velveeta> kartagis: try something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/x3ubh8vs/6/
[12:25:22] <doug_> s/done\(function\(\)/done(function(country)/
[12:25:47] <Velveeta> kartagis: or like this if you want that handler to be the only thing passed to your event listener: http://jsfiddle.net/x3ubh8vs/7/
[12:26:41] <Velveeta> ncls: $(returnedContent).find(':input:first') if you don't care about the element type, or $(returnedContent).find('input:first') if you specifically want it to be an input element
[12:27:24] <Velveeta> .find() will only work if there's a top-level content wrapped around all of the markup though... if it's returned as a bunch of sibling nodes, you may want to do something like this instead: $('<div></div>').append(returnedContent).find('input:first')
[12:28:25] <ncls> Velveeta: ok I thought find() couldn't take any parameter
[12:28:38] <Velveeta> what do you mean?
[12:28:40] <NeedSomeHelp> doug_: shorter code yes but it doesnt work either. I have a php function that returns a json of countries. I am trying to pull data from that json when the user types any letters in the country form field.
[12:28:42] <ncls> Velveeta: oops sorry, I meant "first"
[12:28:58] <ncls> Velveeta: my bad, my brain read "first" instead of "find"
[12:29:02] <ncls> Velveeta: thank you !
[12:29:04] <Velveeta> oh gotcha, no, you can qualify :first with anything you want
[12:29:13] <Velveeta> but the order of those qualifiers counts
[12:29:14] <Kartagis> Velveeta: how do I stop them from entering it, like some sites erase the non-digit?
[12:29:27] <Velveeta> so something like this: (':first:input') isn't the same as (':input:first')
[12:29:58] <Velveeta> kartagis: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[12:30:38] <Velveeta> you'd want to use that on a keypress listener vs keyup though, and you'll have to check the keyCode property of the event object i believe, and get the character it represents, instead of checking this.value
[12:33:26] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: I would put that { on line 5 at the end of line 4. it's a good habit to avoid ASI bugs
[12:33:39] <ncls> Velveeta: doesn't seem to be working, maybe I should add that this is a a full html page being loaded and the input I want is in a form
[12:33:42] <OnceMe> Who wanna come at my mega party
[12:33:45] <OnceMe> paid everything
[12:34:32] <Velveeta> ncls: well, you had said you wanted to find the first input in some returned context via an ajax request... are you saying you're loading a full page of content via ajax, and want just the first input inside the form that's in that content?
[12:34:40] <ncls> Velveeta: my success callback is like this :
[12:34:40] <ncls> $(data).find(':input:first',function(){
[12:34:40] <ncls>         console.log($(this).value());
[12:34:40] <ncls>       });
[12:34:52] <ncls> Velveeta: yes
[12:34:56] <Velveeta> don't paste code blocks in here please, put them into something like pastebin or jsfiddle
[12:35:01] <ncls> ok sorry
[12:35:06] <Velveeta> in that case, you'll need to isolate that form first, and do a find from it
[12:35:15] <Velveeta> $(data).find('form :input:first') or something
[12:35:23] <ncls> Velveeta: I know it's bad but it's not for production purpose ...
[12:35:27] <ncls> Velveeta: ok thanks, will try this
[12:35:31] <Velveeta> if that form has an id or something unique to identify it, that'd make it easier
[12:37:14] <ncls> Velveeta: it has a name
[12:37:25] <ncls> maybe I should be using this
[12:41:06] <ncls> Velveeta: sorry, your first solution was working also, I was using it wrong but it's okay now, thank you
[12:41:16] <Velveeta> good to hear :)
[12:41:56] <ncls> Velveeta: I kept the "find" on "name" attribute value though, because it's safer ... :)
[12:42:28] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: http://jsfiddle.net/qog35m1k/
[12:44:00] <Velveeta> yeah, it's safer than a standard tag name search, but it's slower than a class or id search... probably not *noticeably* on a standard page, but by the benchmarks at least
[12:56:01] <banisterfiend> anyone here have experience with twitter's typeahead.js ?
[13:12:05] <NeedSomeHelp> doug_: I tried your jsfiddle example, but nothing happens when I type letters in the country text field. Also nothing in the console.
[13:12:38] <NeedSomeHelp> no, wait
[13:16:51] <doug_> the autocomplete works as expected
[13:17:10] <doug_> I put that dummy ajax request there to make it work on jsfiddle
[13:17:21] <doug_> but it succeeds and request.term is there
[13:17:50] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: ^
[13:18:05] <codecutter> i have set a trigger on a textarea but it's not seem to be triggering on 'focus', works if I change i change it to 'click, keypress', any ideas why 'focus' is not working? this.on('focus', {textArea: this.foo});
[13:20:55] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: simulated results http://jsfiddle.net/qog35m1k/1/
[13:23:08] <frank_o> Greetings doug_! Real quick, do you know why `if(afterText)` is returning false positives? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/36/
[13:26:01] <doug_> frank_o: looking...
[13:26:12] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: simulate 250ms ajax latency
[13:26:13] <doug_> http://jsfiddle.net/qog35m1k/2/
[13:28:14] <NeedSomeHelp> doug_: country does contain a json, I can confirm that with the console.log lines there. However if I start typing some letters, there appears an empty list just below the input field.
[13:28:50] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: you give an array to the response callback?
[13:29:46] <codecutter> solved
[13:30:37] <doug_> frank_o: always true right http://jsfiddle.net/o4uguntu/37/
[13:31:02] <NeedSomeHelp> have tried both response(country); and response(country.name); in the done() function
[13:31:41] <fwaokda> am I using an incorrect selector or function here? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/754f8faa476030874575  -- I was expecting the alert box to trigger when I change the value inside my input textbox that as an id attribute of position_sort
[13:33:12] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: I see http://jsfiddle.net/o4uguntu/38/
[13:36:12] <NeedSomeHelp> doug_ wrong link/user
[13:36:22] <NeedSomeHelp> doug_: the empty list only appears with response(country)
[13:36:59] <frank_o> doug_: Yeah, it's true even when it's not supposed to be. For instance `beforeText` cases become positive with `afterText`, hence the code placed under the `if(afterText)` will do a great deal of damage.
[13:44:08] <doug_> frank_o: all those things you changed don't work
[13:44:17] <doug_> the cange to parent
[13:44:31] <doug_> I almost have it working again
[13:45:03] <frank_o> I figured those vars would do temporarily till I get the rest of the stuff working then I'd clean those up
[13:45:45] <doug_> frank_o: almost work http://jsfiddle.net/o4uguntu/40/
[13:45:48] <doug_> +s
[13:46:14] <frank_o> doug_: If you don't mind me asking -- can you think of a way to make it work with arbitrary occurrances? ie. `text <youtube> text <youtube><youtube> text <youtube>` etc.
[13:47:06] <doug_> the version I gave you already handles arbitrary occurances, assuming the have a common parent
[13:47:32] <doug_> you need to handle absolutely arbitrary instances in a flat list of elements??
[13:47:36] <frank_o> wow really? i still have your version: http://jsfiddle.net/o4uguntu/28/
[13:48:26] <frank_o> i think so yeah. if by flat you mean no extra children (except those inside .youtube which should just be copied with it)
[13:48:52] <doug_> yes, that code does this: finds every .youtube, then for each one, go up to the parent and get the entire subtree of the dom, then find the index of the .youtube we found. split the flat list of elements into everything before and everything after the .youtube
[13:49:38] <doug_> all over the place, anywhere
[13:50:25] <doug_> it makes the assumption that you want all the text before the youtube, within the parent of the .youtube
[13:50:31] <doug_> before/after
[13:51:30] <frank_o> doug_: Cool. Let's revert to that then!
[13:51:34] <frank_o> one sec
[13:52:45] <doug_> frank_o: this works great for the test case. what is the real scenario, you might need .closest instead of .parent
[13:55:14] <frank_o> doug_: Essentially each div is a user-submitted topic
[13:55:20] <frank_o> doug_: Almost there: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/41/
[13:56:01] <frank_o> doug_: Kinda freaking out with the arbitrary occurances case
[14:14:52] <doug_> frank_o: setup a testcase that has to pass
[14:16:05] <doug_> which one freaks out? the one with several youtubes?
[14:18:20] <frank_o> doug_: Yep that one
[14:18:31] <doug_> frank_o: how do you define what is before and what is after
[14:19:27] <doug_> currently the definition is, everything before/after it that has the same parent
[14:20:59] <frank_o> Not really sure :S
[14:21:06] <frank_o> Think I might need to sleep on it ;)
[14:23:17] <doug_> frank_o: it is helpful to put meaningful strings that indicate whether they are before or after, so in the debugger i can make sense of the strings
[14:23:27] <doug_> instead of lorem ipsum
[14:23:55] <frank_o> Oh yeah. I noticed your version had those.
[14:24:27] <doug_> I can't tell which ones are correct and which ones aren't
[14:25:00] <doug_> and I'd rather not decipher it from the html
[14:25:32] <doug_> can you comment out the cases that work?
[14:25:37] <doug_> that would help a lot
[14:26:45] <frank_o> doug_: All done: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/44/
[14:28:19] <doug_> ok what is the correct behavior for that first one?
[14:29:08] <doug_> how about if I put in extra logic that searches back from the youtube and cuts it off at any preceding or following .youtube
[14:29:19] <doug_> at least it would cut it up
[14:31:29] <frank_o> doug_: Sounds like that'd work, but how to implement it?
[14:33:40] <Paradisee> hello o/
[14:33:52] <frank_o> doug_: FWIW I added expected output at line 21 of the HTML: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/45/
[14:34:05] <Paradisee> do you know any kind of slider image? some kind of a tool slider more than an image one...
[14:34:29] <Paradisee> with a simple arrow on the right and left to choose an item
[14:35:22] <frank_o> Paradisee: I use slick.js
[14:35:38] <frank_o> Paradisee: you mean image slideshow right?
[14:35:50] <Paradisee> that one could work
[14:35:52] <Paradisee> thanks
[14:47:03] <doug_> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/o4uguntu/46/
[14:47:56] <doug_> oops http://jsfiddle.net/o4uguntu/47/
[14:48:13] <doug_> better?
[14:48:53] <doug_> frank_o: ^
[14:49:26] <frank_o> doug_: aaaaaaalmost :P
[14:49:37] <frank_o> oh man. you are just.
[14:49:48] <frank_o> yeah, ideally just one resultDiv though
[14:50:01] <doug_> jquery is like an infomercial. it slices AND dices
[14:50:25] <frank_o> haha
[14:50:42] <doug_> is it right though?
[14:50:49] <doug_> comment out any working cases
[14:50:51] <frank_o> like jack lalanne
[14:50:52] <NeedSomeHelp> Whats wrong with this syntax? $("#countries ul").append("<li>"+"hei"+"</li>");
[14:51:04] <doug_> NeedSomeHelp: security hole
[14:51:17] <NeedSomeHelp> how?
[14:51:20] <doug_> assuming that "hei" thing is user input
[14:51:40] <NeedSomeHelp> I get: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <li>
[14:52:17] <NeedSomeHelp> it will become indirectly a user input yes
[14:52:19] <doug_> secure version: $('#countries ul').append($('<li/>').text('hei'));
[14:52:43] <doug_> then hei can be malicious and it's ok
[14:52:51] <doug_> 'hei'*
[14:54:30] <doug_> $('#countries ul').append($('<li/>').text('<script>location.href="evil.com/phishme";</script>'));   <-- safe
[14:54:57] <frank_o> doug_: it's a little bit off. currently it's: **DIV 1** => middle 2 + youtube + after  **DIV 2** => youtube + middle 2  **DIV 3** => middle 1 + youtube  **DIV 4** => before + youtube + middle 1
[14:55:13] <frank_o> doug_: ideally it should be: **DIV 1** => before + youtube + middle 1 + youtube + youtube + middle 2 + youtube + after
[14:55:23] <NeedSomeHelp> doug_: thanks for your tip, but same error message as before
[14:58:11] <NeedSomeHelp> http://jsfiddle.net/qog35m1k/3/
[14:58:46] <doug_> frank_o: really?
[14:59:08] <doug_> thats what it already did
[14:59:46] <doug_> you wanted to preserve all of those extra .youtube elements in the output, that's what it didnt do
[15:02:18] <frank_o> doug_: as far as I can tell all previous fiddles have not been able to get the order right + created multiple divs where there should only be one
[15:02:26] <frank_o> i hope im not wrong about this..
[15:03:33] <frank_o> doug_: basically i just want to split up user posts into a chronological succession of new paragraphs if that makes any sense..
[15:04:56] <frank_o> doug_: line 21 of the html incase you missed it
[15:09:15] <doug_> frank_o: sorry, it's hard to tell whether it works or not without combing through the html
[15:11:30] <frank_o> yep
[15:50:39] <Aristy> Hi, I have a weird issue.
[15:50:48] <Aristy> The snippet is: http://laravel.io/bin/aajo2
[15:51:03] <Aristy> When I click, it tries to make a GET request
[15:51:08] <Aristy> even though I set type to POST
[15:51:55] <Aristy> Anyone knows why?
[16:17:26] <Tomashe> hey guys , anyone free some some simple jquery work?
[16:17:29] <Tomashe> pm me if u are
[16:19:08] <Profpatsch> Should $("p") select all paragraphs or only the first?
[16:57:48] <uskerine> Hi, I am trying to detect when user clicks on a checkbox and depending on its final value (checked or not) do something. The HTML code is like this: http://pastebin.com/5PXtiB6Q (I am using a template based on bootstrap). I tried .click()  .on("change",    and .on("click"    but when I program those events in jQuery I find that the check/uncheck status does not change, it is always checked.
[16:57:48] <uskerine> Any tip/idea? Thanks
[17:03:12] <ehva> uskerine, the change event should work http://stackoverflow.com/a/8423235
[17:06:52] <uskerine> .change works, thanks a lot
[17:10:15] <solexious> I have a html table that looks like this, how should I find it by its id, then be able to read the continence of each <td></td>? https://gist.github.com/solexious/1532211818af8e9d7b66
[18:06:20] <jasonborn> if i want to make a chat html5 demo with jquery using a ui like this: http://cdn.css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/google-hangouts.png
[18:07:12] <jasonborn> how can i make sure the sender messages appear on the left side only when i have usernames of people
[18:10:36] <imacinto> jasonborn: I don't think I understand your question. what do you mean by "have the usernames of people"?
[18:11:06] <jasonborn> im asking because when i do it traditional way by comparing users chatting to logged in user, it doesnt work well, im thinking of creating a json of chat messages and having jquery display messages based on the json which include username next to message
[18:11:13] <jasonborn> but i wanted to know the best way of doing this
[18:11:19] <jasonborn> im creating a php jquery chat
[18:11:34] <jasonborn> by that i mean usernames of people in the chat session
[18:11:54] <jasonborn> so now i need to tell the computer whose messages to are shown on left and on right like in the pic
[18:12:04] <jasonborn> and i want receiver on right, and sender on left
[18:12:46] <jasonborn> get it?
[18:12:50] <jasonborn> imacinto
[18:13:02] <imacinto> :)
[18:14:49] <imacinto> are you asking about how to best build the data structure for what's your chat log? or how to apply the styling to orient the message? or how to have a browser know what user they are?
[18:15:11] <jasonborn> how to apply styling to orient the message properly
[18:16:13] <imacinto> huh. like literally the CSS?
[18:16:25] <jasonborn> well i have the css http://cdn.css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/google-hangouts.png
[18:16:27] <jasonborn> as shown here
[18:16:49] <jasonborn> i just want to know how can i have sender messages be shown on left and the user logged in has his messages appear on right
[18:18:54] <imacinto> http://jsfiddle.net/bangarang/63snxky9/
[18:20:45] <jasonborn> i tried:   $( '*[data-user="' + data.username + '"]' ).parent().addClass('rightSide');    which adds a class rightSide to the message but when the other user im chatting with enters their message, it also appears on right side even on my screen. what i wanted to accomplish was to
[18:21:18] <jphase> ? what's with the funky selector
[18:21:36] <jphase> no need for the * in there
[18:21:44] <imacinto> you can eliminate the *, and I'd drop the quotes for readability's sake
[18:21:51] <jasonborn> that selector selects the messages where data-user = the username
[18:22:03] <jphase> yeah, same without the *
[18:23:28] <imacinto> actually, you should drop the quotes for practicality's sake; your string will add them in
[18:23:42] <imacinto> your selector is probably coming through as [data-user=""string""]
[18:24:08] <jasonborn> ok
[18:24:11] <jasonborn> let me try
[18:45:11] <jasonborn> im gonna try my json solution i had in mind
[19:11:43] <rgraphix> Is there any drawbacks to using $(window).data() instead of a global variable?
[19:12:53] <shwackd> doug_ thank you again ... after watching node.js intro videos I understand what you did now
[19:13:11] <doug_> shwackd: np
[19:14:59] <doug_> rgraphix: a tiny bit of overhead, assuming you dont call .data in any tight loops
[19:16:24] <rgraphix> dough: i just want to change the values and then call it. I know globals shouldn't be used that way. Is it alright to use data() that way?
[19:28:22] <^^x^^> hi everyone!
[19:29:18] <^^x^^>  if "select" is 8, why does the code enter in the if(select == 13) code?
[19:29:22] <^^x^^> I mean...wtf?
[20:17:41] <rn10950> Does anyone know of a tag I could put in HTML to group <TR>s together so I could insert inside of
[20:46:57] <shwackd> a tag or an attribute
[20:47:37] <shwackd> if i understand what you wanna do correctly, which is insert something into a certain set of table rows, I would use the class attribute
[20:51:20] <rn10950> I would like to group trs together to create a list and sublist, so when you create a new task, the new task will append after the last tasktree
[20:51:43] <rn10950> I may just use multiple <tbody>s
[21:01:08] <amh345> i have a form that will submit some values with a value of 0 via select.  is there a way to find all the selects with a 0 value and remove them along with their matching input field?  here's a jsfiddle of the source html.
[21:01:39] <amh345> also, this form is currently being submitted via ajax. so I'm hoping i can get something functioning in the on submit.
