[00:03:41] <noobiewan> hey guys, I'm using $.get with JSON and it seems it's converting single quotes to &#39; do you know anything about this? how can I avoid it converting the single quotes?
[02:59:42] <AllTuna> Hey guys
[03:00:15] <AllTuna> I'm trying to understand how best to write my jquery script for general on-page optimisations
[03:00:57] <AllTuna> Things like, dropdown selections changing CSS, and elements sliding from outside of the screen
[03:01:16] <AllTuna> Where do you guys write those scripts?
[03:01:30] <Kartagis> define "where"?
[03:01:32] <mouse> in a van down by the river, mostly
[03:01:47] <Kartagis> I'm at my desk
[03:02:05] <AllTuna> Well, I used to have one functions.js where I'd write all code like that, and I'd check for the page via <body id=">
[03:02:08] <mouse> you're lucky you have a desk. some of us just have hopes, and dreams
[03:02:15] <AllTuna> But that seemed very messy
[03:05:02] <Uhkis> AllTuna: if i understood your question correctly, the backend should specify the needed file per page
[03:05:44] <AllTuna> Uhkis, I mean how should I organise the jquery files
[03:17:52] <benl90> hello, can anyone help me, how to make this thing not reaching stack limit? my recursion function is for floodfill anyway using html canvas, this's the code, since the image can't be uploaded. http://pastebin.com/gAhRgtQV
[03:18:04] <benl90> I can't paste it in fiddle
[03:18:46] <Uhkis> yet you managed to paste it in pastebin, what's the problem with jsfiddle?
[03:19:49] <benl90> okay i'll paste it in fiddle, but no image anyway, it use getImage that not meet the security, if you not hosted on server
[03:23:54] <benl90> https://jsfiddle.net/ggyoqrwd/
[03:29:52] <Bexzz> Hello
[03:30:10] <Bexzz> My client down. Can anyone help me?
[03:30:23] <Bexzz> I'm benyamin from above
[03:30:28] <Bexzz> Benl90
[04:04:52] <AdamPDotty> Bexzz: looks overly complicated, but I do not see any problem.
[04:05:35] <Bexzz> AdamPDotty what complicated?
[04:13:36] <AdamPDotty> you call the functions $(this) and val() three times in a row
[04:14:12] <AdamPDotty> and for comparing you could probably keep a colorvalue as whole
[04:27:31] <Bexzz> The array of colour?
[04:27:40] <Bexzz> AdamPDotty?
[04:28:23] <AdamPDotty> hmm, yes
[04:32:56] <Bexzz> AdamPDotty so sorry, i'm newbie anyway, so the aray val should be called? Then after changging then put it?
[04:33:28] <Bexzz> Because i'm confused with array that bringged back from getcontext 2d
[04:42:17] <soc42> hi #jquery
[04:43:00] <soc42> i am getting a strange output while putting $.fn.jquery to ouput jquery version
[04:43:42] <soc42> in the page included is v1.9.1 downloaded from https://code.jquery.com/jquery/, but the version strings in firefox console returns 1.8.3 ???
[04:48:27] <soc42> same "1.8.3" returning from console if jquery-1.10.0.min.js has been loaded in html head ???
[04:58:20] <daslicht> anyome knows a jquery plugin which lets you build grid layouts (or responsive absolute, fluid what ever) like this wordpress theme does :
[04:58:20] <daslicht> http://laytheme.com
[05:03:01] <soc42> been googling around and just put the bootstrap.js (former from html body) right after jquery.js into html header, which prevents the bootstrap detection error, but the jquery version from console is still "1.8.3", see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22658015/bootstrap-wont-detect-jquery-1-11-0-uncaught-error-bootstraps-javascript-re
[05:03:42] <soc42> seems logic is not enough ;o)
[05:03:48] <doublel93> hey, I'm trying to make an ajax request to get Json but I get a blocked cross-origin request, can someone explain why ?   http://jsbin.com/joconalaja/edit?html,output
[05:04:26] <soc42> doublel93: are you running the request on the same server/domain?
[05:04:37] <doublel93> no
[05:05:49] <doublel93> soc42: I need that the data is accessible outside of my server, so I added Token authentication, but I still get the error
[05:07:02] <soc42> maybe you can first put the foreign data via PHP file_get_contents() to your data an the process a local ajax request?
[05:08:53] <doublel93> ehm, I don't use php, but shouldn't it work with just ajax ?
[05:10:06] <soc42> depends on how much time you have â€“ sometimes you'll have to find different solutions to problems than mere logic and programming lanuage/conceptual consistency...
[05:13:12] <soc42> from your perspective, it should, be in javascript there is "SOP" (same origin policy) which only allows request form scripts/jquery on your server. there is also CORS (cross origin resource sharing), but not all browser support that!
[05:13:32] <doublel93> soc42: do you know how to see the headers sent ? in firefox developer tools I see  Access-Control-Request-Headers: "authorization" ..... where can I see it value ?
[05:15:15] <soc42> doublel93: there is a firefox addon called "live https headers" ;o)
[05:15:19] <doublel93> oh so it's a javascript problem, on mobile I shouldn't have problems right
[05:16:37] <doublel93> soc42: sorry installing the addon restarted the browser
[05:16:39] <soc42> if wouldn't use javascript on mobile, then yes. it's a javascript processing fixture
[05:18:36] <doublel93> soc42: if I had to test an rest api what would you advise to use =D
[05:22:15] <soc42> use "curl" from commandline or e.g. "httprequester" (also an firefox addon), see: https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/httprequester/
[05:27:43] <neuromute9> hey folks, I'm wanting to filter a form to select all inputs with a name attribute (at present I get all inputs using :input and that includes a load of stuff I don't want processed)
[05:28:12] <neuromute9> I've tried :input[data=*] to no avail
[05:28:17] <Cork> neuromute9: any reason you don't just use .serializeArray() ?
[05:28:39] <Cork> anyway you want :input[data]
[05:28:50] <neuromute9> Cork, nope, that looks like a far better solution, cheers!
[05:28:54] <Cork> data=* would match <input data="*">
[05:29:38] <neuromute9> Cork, yeah, I wanted to wildcard it.  Obviously messed up the syntax
[05:29:52] <neuromute9> Thanks for the heads up on serializeArray, that's perfect ;)
[05:30:31] <Cork> neuromute9: there are a plugin that gives you serializeObject
[05:30:43] <Cork> it might be very nifty (makes it easier to automate)
[05:31:00] <Cork> https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject
[05:32:36] <neuromute9> Thanks again! :)
[05:32:46] <Cork> np
[07:24:25] <anotheryou_> if i clone() something, how can I reference it if not in the same command? An anonymous function with $this or something?
[07:24:37] <anotheryou_> I mean reference the cloned instance
[07:25:40] <anotheryou_> $('#div').clone().appendTo('body').addClass('myclass'); // I understand this. But I want to add a timeout to this specific instance and don't know how
[07:26:16] <anotheryou_> or do I have to construct a unique ID for the div?
[07:48:15] <Uhkis> anotheryou_: yes, it will need a unique id.
[07:49:19] <anotheryou_> Uhkis, no way wtih some this magic?
[07:49:27] <anotheryou_> ok. thank you :)
[07:49:41] <Uhkis> html doesnt allow duplicate ids
[07:49:48] <anotheryou_> I'll be lazy and do on demand polling...
[09:00:02] <Ahiiru> hello
[09:00:06] <Ahiiru> how do I call this sidebar effect? http://demo.qodeinteractive.com/bridge8/portfolio_page/art-design-blvd/
[09:00:12] <Ahiiru> it's not "sticky sidebar", because it's not fixed, but it moves smoothly
[10:23:06] <jomofcw> Hello !
[10:25:00] <jomofcw> I would like to be able to use resizable on an element that contain text. When I resize it (with aspect ratio preserved), the text still take 100% width/height of the element... how can I do that according to you ?
[10:48:37] <Ty_> If you want to reference divs based on data relationships, do you just use .data('relationship-name')?
[10:49:17] <taplar> look them up with an id or class, then use filter
[10:49:46] <Ty_> well they all have the same classes
[10:50:17] <Ty_> what I'm trying to do is make it so clicking one's header has a direct corelation with it's matching body
[10:50:38] <taplar> that's fine, just don't use a data attribute in a selector.  you want to avoid a dom scan
[10:51:03] <Ty_> So will I want something along the lines of
[10:52:13] <Ty_> $('.tabs__head').filter('intro').removeClass('.tabs__body--is-hidden');   ?
[10:52:44] <taplar> what is 'intro'?
[10:53:03] <Ty_> wrapped in a click function like this:    $('.tabs__head', this).on('click', function(index) {
[10:53:13] <Ty_> that's the data-relationship  name
[10:53:52] <taplar> $('.tabs__head').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('relationship') === 'intro'; })
[10:54:40] <Ty_> I was having an issue with onload where it would flash the divs that should be hidden, so I put the `is hidden` class on the last 3, but now having trouble removing them on click:     for reference: https://jsfiddle.net/jjehquyh/3/
[10:55:45] <Ty_> So in your example, you aren't wrapping the reference in a function? orthe whole filter process is the function?
[10:56:57] <taplar> the filter is taking a function to do the filter so it stays out of... whatever the lookup engine jquery uses.  i'm drawing a blank right now
[10:57:12] <taplar> sizzle
[10:57:59] <taplar> what's wrong with this fiddle?
[10:58:08] <Ty_> So would I want to wrap that within an ('on.click')?
[10:58:56] <Ty_> On our test site, on load it will flash the divs that should be hidden
[10:59:29] <taplar> i'm assuming they're not starting off hidden then
[11:02:10] <Ty_> That would be correct
[11:02:30] <taplar> yeah, you need to set that by default with the markup/css
[11:02:36] <Ty_> thats why I was trying to start them with the classes
[11:02:46] <Ty_> but then they don't show up on click
[11:02:59] <taplar> changing it with js is going to keep the flash
[11:04:14] <Ty_> But right now, on click isn't dropping my class?
[11:04:40] <taplar> it seems like clicking a header is showing that headers body in the fiddle for me.  ?
[11:05:12] <Ty_> I'll PM you the live site, 1 moment
[11:10:51] <taplar> that was werid
[11:20:07] <dpy> Hi guys, we have this problem with jQuery UI draggable in combination with the containment option. Is this the right channel to ask?
[11:20:41] <dpy> If we change the size of the draggable while dragging, the containment calculation is wrong, because it seems to cache the size upon dragstart
[11:20:51] <dpy> Here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/md7bf6vq/1/
[11:21:11] <dpy> Is there any way around this problem?
[11:32:01] <dpy> Problem solved: http://jsfiddle.net/md7bf6vq/2/
[12:12:36] <JZA> I want to create an effect where Jquery hides the content and shows a new one on click.
[12:16:31] <jquery584> hi
[12:16:47] <jquery584> I have a question, who can help me?
[12:17:23] <jquery584> I really need help
[12:17:54] <jquery584> dear friends
[12:18:02] <jquery584> who is online here?
[13:18:21] <coeal_> If I have a TR that looks like this: | ID | Date | Title | Checkbox w/ ID as value | Is there any possible way to select all checkboxes for a certain date?
[13:31:00] <decx> yes
[13:39:12] <jquery223> hi
[13:39:24] <jquery223> who is online?
[13:39:39] <jquery223> I have a question, who can answer me?
[13:40:13] <Calinou> jquery223: don't ask to ask, just ask
[13:40:26] <jquery223> ok
[13:41:32] <jquery223> Calino, I clone an element and appent to same div that original element is in it
[13:41:52] <jquery223> I want to remove original element
[13:42:17] <jquery223> I did it,  but the main problem is in animation
[13:42:43] <jquery223> Jquery doesn't animate it
[13:43:03] <jquery223> and jquery don't show animation movement
[13:43:48] <jquery223> how to design it?
[13:44:56] <jquery223> Calinou, you don't answer me?
[13:45:01] <jquery223> :)
[13:46:07] <jquery223> ok
[13:46:08] <jquery223> bye
[14:16:17] <islalobo> I'm having an issue with my js compiled with gulp. We have a number of npm packages but the app keeps coming back with $(â€¦).inputmask OR $(â€¦).datepicker is not a function
[14:19:36] <taplar_busy> looks like there is a #gulp room
[14:20:42] <islalobo> Thanks :)
[14:23:02] <printForever> in Console I type $(".classhere").lenght trying to find out how many times a DIV with class .classhere is inside HTML...
[14:23:06] <printForever> it returns undefined
[14:23:16] <taplar_busy> length
[14:23:22] <taplar_busy> in case you mistyped
[14:23:34] * printForever grabs a gun...
[14:23:55] <taplar_busy> ironic that i'm the one correcting spelling
[14:24:21] <printForever> am I safe to assume that because .length shows the number of .classhere, that is the same number of times each() will run?
[14:24:30] <taplar_busy> yep
[14:24:47] * printForever loads a gun
[14:24:59] <taplar_busy> ?
[14:25:15] <printForever> then why the F! is the .each() running 8 times instead of 2?!
[14:25:22] <taplar_busy> lets see what your doing
[14:25:39] <printForever> I can't... :(
[14:25:46] <taplar_busy> hokay
[14:25:49] <printForever> yeah
[14:26:03] <taplar_busy> so your saying length is 2?
[14:26:10] <printForever> yup
[14:26:11] <Uhkis> YOU'RE probably doing some double looping
[14:26:14] <taplar_busy> and it's running 8 times
[14:26:16] <Uhkis> wink wink taplar_busy ;D
[14:26:23] <printForever> 8 bloody times
[14:26:28] <taplar_busy> yeah, was going to say sounds like he's doing the same process 4 times
[14:27:04] <decx> maybe you're stacking implied eachs'
[14:27:06] <printForever> I even tried to catch ajaxReload in order to prevent it firing multiple times...
[14:27:13] <Uhkis> show the code
[14:27:18] <decx> oh ajax, welp
[14:27:23] <printForever> yeah...
[14:27:32] <printForever> ajaxReload... entire site is ajaxReload
[14:27:32] <decx> i smell shenanigangs
[14:27:34] <decx> -g
[14:27:36] <taplar_busy> it doesn't have to work, just seeing the logic can help
[14:27:38] <decx> gangs hehe
[14:27:42] <JZA> how can I debug JQuery correctly?
[14:27:54] <JZA> I am trying to do some calls but cant seem to catch anything
[14:27:58] <taplar_busy> google "fixing these jquery"
[14:28:03] <JZA> ok
[14:29:42] <printForever> taplar_busy, even if I send you the code, it would take some time to realize it... You need to see the actual page, understand what needs to be done... It's complicated.
[14:29:50] <printForever> I must have screwed something up
[14:30:01] <printForever> I will check with IF's and skipp if there is something inside
[14:30:34] <taplar_busy> whatever your process is, try putting a console log at the start of it.  see if it's writing out 4 times
[14:31:51] <printForever> thats what I'm doing now
[14:32:29] * taplar_busy claims credit and puffs out his chest
[14:33:01] <Uhkis> printForever: is this in some event? check for double bindings
[14:33:13] <printForever> will do
[14:51:12] <mad_hatter> is there a way to dump json ojects returned from .ajax() calls?
[14:53:58] <Uhkis> define dump
[14:54:10] <Uhkis> you can use console.log() to view them
[14:58:25] <printForever> how can I append to the index?
[14:58:40] <printForever> so... I'm doing for each(), function can have index
[14:58:51] <printForever> so... how do I append to the [0] or [1]
[15:03:28] <shoky_> printForever: hm? append what to what?
[15:17:52] <printForever> what can cause .each() to reset each time?
[15:19:08] <mad_hatter> if i have a json that looks like {pkgs:[{foo:'bar'},{baz=>'bing'}]} is there a way I can look through that in the success of an .ajax()?
[15:19:19] <mad_hatter> loop*
[15:23:37] <joaocastanho> Hey. How can I do something like, I have an input and someone enters something and then execute ajax?
[15:24:02] <Uhkis> joaocastanho: attach to input event
[15:24:27] <joaocastanho> onkeyup?
[15:24:29] <Uhkis> printForever: what do you mean reset?
[15:24:59] <Uhkis> joaocastanho: $(yourelement).on('input', ...
[15:25:07] <joaocastanho> just that?
[15:25:31] <Uhkis> well that was far from complete example but yes
[15:25:40] <joaocastanho> okay
[15:25:42] <joaocastanho> I'll try
[15:27:23] <joaocastanho> yeah, that's it. thanks a lot ;)
[15:27:32] <joaocastanho> I thought I would need onkeyup or onkeydown
[15:28:02] <Uhkis> i like input, it works with browser autocompletions too
[15:28:35] <joaocastanho> yeah, it's simple and nice
[15:28:52] <Uhkis> yeah, less typing too! :D
[15:32:43] <taplar_busy> mad_hatter: afaik => is not valid in json
[15:32:47] <joaocastanho> yeah :)
[15:33:58] <printForever> Uhkis and everyone, how to test if <div class="heynow"></div> has any conntent inside it?
[15:34:18] <Uhkis> .text().length
[15:34:25] <Uhkis> or html()
[15:34:41] <printForever> text returns a bunc
[15:34:45] <printForever> I will check html
[15:35:23] <taplar_busy> if you already have the element as a 'this' reference innerHTML instead of wrapping it
[15:44:35] <SpecialTech> Hmm  3.0 released today
[15:45:17] <taplar_busy> cool
[15:45:24] <printForever> can I print IF value?
[15:45:28] <printForever> is it true or false?
[15:45:32] <printForever> alert (if)
[15:45:43] <printForever> (I'm writting BS, I've lost all focus)
[15:46:15] <taplar_busy> you want to write the result of a conditional?
[15:46:27] <printForever> yes
[15:46:34] <Uhkis> just console.log the same thing you're putting in the if
[15:46:40] <printForever> ah
[15:46:42] <taplar_busy> sure.  console.log( var2 === '3' )
[15:47:41] <taplar_busy> console.log is just a method, like all the rest.  so long and whatever you put in between the () evaluates to something, it's happy
[15:48:03] <systemfault> 3.0 is something I might never use though...
[15:48:41] <SpecialTech> I mean, I know people who are still on like 1.11 lol...
[15:48:53] <taplar_busy> i figure depending on needed support, and as time goes on, 3 will work fine
[15:49:03] <Uhkis> SpecialTech: a lot of people are still on a lot older than that :)
[15:49:43] <SpecialTech> Uhkis: I don't doubt it, but that's I think as far back my peeps go lol
[15:50:13] <systemfault> SpecialTech: Some people use old WP themes that have 1.4 bundled.
[15:50:39] <Uhkis> *cough* drupal *cough*
[15:51:12] <printForever> HOW THE HELL it goes from true to false to true to false to true to false
[15:51:18] <printForever> THERE ARE ONLY 2 of them!
[16:01:21] <taplar_busy> sounds fun
[16:02:00] <Uhkis> sounds like one of them is a function that changes something
[16:05:07] <printForever> how do I limit it to only run the first time
[16:05:20] <printForever> its like each() get's reseted
[16:05:33] <printForever> I know
[16:05:39] <printForever> I will do .length
[16:05:53] <printForever> if bla bla bla =< lenght
[16:05:55] <printForever> *th
[16:06:22] <linux_daemon> hey guys, i know it is not the propper channel to address this, but can someone point me to some channel for chrome extensions development?
[16:07:47] <linux_daemon> anyone?
[16:09:53] <taplar_busy> printForever: so you put a console.log right before the each and that only prints out once?
[16:10:25] <sillyslux> linux_daemon, #chromium-extensions
[16:17:19] <printForever> taplar_busy it prints 3x
[16:17:22] <printForever> 2x
[16:17:28] <printForever> basically 6x
[16:17:55] <Uhkis> printForever: so you cant show the code?
[16:21:28] <taplar_busy> so maybe figure out why that's happening?
[16:26:05] <islalobo> I have an ajax call that is returning the html of the page rather than my response.
[16:36:44] <printForever> can I stop each?
[16:36:50] <printForever> stoppropagate
[16:36:52] <printForever>  or something
[16:37:38] <taplar_busy> dude, your trying to fix the effects of an issue, not your issue
[16:37:46] <printForever> yeah
[16:37:51] <taplar_busy> fix the issue
[16:37:52] <printForever> and I want to get it done now
[16:37:58] <printForever> not my problem
[16:38:07] <printForever> and even if I could
[16:38:14] <printForever> which I cant
[16:38:18] <printForever> no one would give a crap
[16:38:25] <taplar_busy> then why should we?
[16:38:33] <printForever> we're not fixing the issue
[16:38:51] <printForever> I mean, the effect of an issue
[16:39:33] <printForever> I know that there is ajax on the page
[16:39:41] <printForever> vwo_$( document ).ajaxComplete(function() { but this does absolutely NOTHING
[16:39:51] <printForever> vwo or $ same thing
[16:40:13] <printForever> well, it does stop the code from executing, so it does something
[16:40:22] <printForever> but its never triggered
[16:41:05] <printForever> and I know there is ajaxRequest on the page, but... it does not influence it... there is nothing abouve "document" so if its not triggered, there is nothing I can do
[16:41:19] <printForever> also, i've tried to limit the loop (each) but it failed several times
[16:41:46] <printForever> problem is that something (ajaxRequest) is reloading the page, so it starts counting all over again and reloads the scripts
[16:41:58] <printForever> reloading scripts, it reloads var's
[16:42:08] <printForever> and it keeps fing me over
[16:44:32] <taplar_busy> you're saying that the ajaxComplete does not fire?
[16:44:39] <printForever> yeah
[16:45:12] <taplar_busy> why do you say this?
[16:45:24] <printForever> I've tested it
[16:45:35] <taplar_busy> you've put a console log in there and don't see it?
[16:45:51] <printForever> I used Alert
[16:46:07] <taplar_busy> fine.  ok, so next question.  your ajax is reloading the page?
[16:46:33] <printForever> only <div class="mydiv">
[16:46:47] <printForever> but depending on the page, there could be 20 divs like that
[16:46:50] <printForever> right now I have 2
[16:47:08] <printForever> *they are created dynamically
[16:47:33] <taplar_busy> ok, so the logic that contains the each, how is that related to all this?
[16:48:08] <printForever> Inside <div class="mydiv"> there is <a> that I deatach from it and add it to <div class="newdiv">
[16:49:00] <printForever> my logic (I confirmed on fiddle that works) was to go through each of the .mydiv and deatach <a> and attach it to .newdiv
[16:49:26] <printForever> problem is... ajaxRequest or GOD KNOWS WHAT is reloading the script each time, thats why everything is doubled or trippled
[16:49:59] <taplar_busy> if your not reloading the page, the only way a script would reload is if the script is being brought in on an ajax response and inserted into the body
[16:50:24] <printForever> ok
[16:50:59] <taplar_busy> is that happening?
[16:51:21] <printForever> I don't know...
[16:51:46] <printForever> how can I determine that?
[16:51:59] <taplar_busy> look at the response to your ajax requests in your network tab
[17:04:52] <mad_hatter> {"pkgs":[{"foo":"bar"},{"baz":"bing"}]} <--- is this valid json?
[17:05:12] <mad_hatter> if so, is there a way that you can loop through that with .each() in a success function from an .ajax() call?
[17:05:28] <taplar_busy> looks valid
[17:06:42] <taplar_busy> and you can loop through thejsonobject.pkgs, but your keys are not uniform so that's going to be awkward for you
[17:07:43] <sillyslux> you can use a js array function on that, response.pkgs.forEach()
[17:07:58] <taplar_busy> right, but what i'm saying is one's key is foo and the other is bar
[17:08:04] <sillyslux> or .map or whatever
[17:08:06] <taplar_busy> so he's going to have some sort of conditional
[17:08:25] <taplar_busy> which might mean that the backend should perhaps be putting these related things into a single object
[17:08:29] <taplar_busy> but i dunno the data model
[17:08:37] <sillyslux> ^
[17:09:37] <sillyslux> jquery's .each() (from the docs) Description: Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.
[17:10:25] <sillyslux> your response/ parsed json is no jquery-object
[17:13:23] <mad_hatter> well...the keys represent different packages
[17:13:38] <mad_hatter> foo is a unique package, as is bar
[17:13:57] <mad_hatter> within the greater 'pkgs' array
[17:15:19] <printForever> taplar_busy, can I interact with atIndex object?
[17:16:08] <printForever> from the previous .mydiv (there are 4 of them now), so when going through them, there are 0-3 meaning they are in array. can I grab [i]
[17:16:16] <printForever> or interact with [i]
[17:16:52] <printForever> its inside each
[17:21:01] <printForever> $(this[n]).next().find("a").detach();
[17:24:14] <Dhong_> Is there a way to detect if a user has deselected by clicking within a selection of text?
[17:24:33] <printForever> deselected?
[17:24:36] <sillyslux> printForever, set a breakpoint and examine "this" in the debugger to see what this[n] could be
[17:25:30] <printForever> sillyslux, I'm asking from syntax point
[17:26:59] <Dhong_> also, what would be be the best way to obtain the caret position of a client after deselecting text in the manner I described?
[17:27:23] <printForever> Dhong_ no one has basic idea what you meant the first time
[17:27:37] <Dhong_> right, sorry about that
[17:28:09] <printForever> Dhong_, if you want to detect if user's mouse has left area, use mouseover()
[17:28:12] <Dhong_> so wha tI mean is, a user selects some text within a text editable element, then later deselects by clicking on that selection
[17:29:15] <printForever> Dhong_, there is mouseLeave, there is hover, there is focus... you have 10 different ways to do it
[17:29:17] <sillyslux> printForever, $('div').each(e=>{console.log(this)}) gives me window
[17:29:47] <printForever> sillyslux, logging e, not this
[17:31:08] <sillyslux> printForever, $('div').each((index,element)=>{console.log(index,element,this)}) gives me array index, element, window
[17:31:35] <printForever> ok
[17:32:34] <Dhong_> printForever, what Im concerned about is detecting when a user clears their selection of text they have made
[17:32:45] <Dhong_> so for instance, asdfgh
[17:32:51] <Dhong_> user selects gh
[17:33:06] <Dhong_> later they clear their selection by clicking either elsewhere or on their selection again
[17:34:27] <printForever> sillyslux can I combine THIS and index
[17:34:32] <printForever> that's what I was asking all along
[17:34:43] <sillyslux> instead of this you could write window
[17:35:01] <printForever> ?
[17:35:05] <printForever> sillyslux...
[17:35:21] <sillyslux> what's this referring to?
[17:35:27] <sillyslux> with your code?
[17:35:31] <printForever> its fine
[17:35:34] <printForever> forget about it
[17:35:43] <sillyslux> did you examine it in debugger?
[17:36:07] <printForever> I asked a syntax question, I've found the answer trial and error
[17:53:11] <shoky_> you were getting this===window because you're using a fat-arrow function. normally it is the current element in the loop
[18:00:04] <sillyslux> yes, thx $('div').each(function(i,a,b){console.log(i,a,this===a)}) gives me index, element, true
[18:42:33] <printForever> how can I console.log var content?
[18:43:40] <printForever> all I get with console.log(varName) is [object Object]
[18:49:42] <ales> printForever use console.log(varName.toString());
[18:49:54] <printForever> thank you!
[19:26:43] <huck5> How can I ensure a specific page element has been loaded/exists before performing operations on it?
[19:27:48] <huck5> function(){
[19:27:48] <huck5> 	var ownerType = getFieldValueByName(TRIGGER_FIELD.getName());	
[19:27:48] <huck5> 	var accountNum = TRIGGER_FIELD.getName().substring(21);	
[19:27:48] <huck5> 		
[19:27:48] <huck5> 	if(ownerType != "" && ownerType != null){
[19:27:49] <huck5> 		setFieldConstraintValueByName("ProposedReq_AcctType" + accountNum, "LOOKUP_NAME", ownerType);		
[19:27:49] <huck5> 	}
[19:27:50] <huck5> 	else{		
[19:27:50] <huck5> 		clearDropdownByName("ProposedReq_AcctType" + accountNum);
[19:27:51] <huck5> 	}				
[19:27:53] <huck5> i did not mean to do that..
[20:40:23] <mikesrike> How can I get element next to another element?
[20:43:22] <systemfault> .next()
[20:44:27] <mikesrike> It gets every element in the pattern
[20:44:41] <systemfault> Then don't add a pattern
[20:45:00] <mikesrike> How can I do foreach loop without pattern? It is a pattern
[20:45:17] <systemfault> myElement.next()
[20:45:24] <mikesrike> No
[20:45:58] <mikesrike> Look, here's the thing: three times div.main every contains div.one and div.two
[20:46:25] <mikesrike> I want to be able to get the div.two from div.one in just one div.main
[20:46:47] <systemfault> myDivOne.next()
[20:46:52] <mikesrike> If I do it like you sad, then every div.two is selected
[20:48:01] <mdiamond> anybody else spot the bug in the example here: https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#feature-for-of-loops-can-be-used-on-jquery-collections ?
[20:48:18] <mdiamond> :)
[20:48:33] <mdiamond> p.s. congrats on jQuery 3.0!
[20:48:46] <systemfault> mdiamond: I don't see one.
[20:48:59] <mdiamond> $.each should be elems.each
[20:49:13] <systemfault> No.
[20:49:22] <mdiamond> ?
[20:49:23] <systemfault> Ahhh right
[20:49:30] <mdiamond> hehe
[20:49:31] <systemfault> You're right :)
[20:49:52] <mdiamond> heh, on occasion I get things right :)
[20:49:55] <systemfault> Nice find:)
[20:50:08] <mdiamond> thanks
[20:50:29] <mdiamond> I will accept my $1000 bounty in bitcoin
[20:50:31] <mdiamond> :P
[20:50:48] <systemfault> Do you take fake internet hugs?
[20:50:52] <systemfault> :(
[20:50:59] <mdiamond> haha
[20:52:37] <mdiamond> systemfault: do you work on the site? or should I drop them a line over at #jquery-content
[20:52:46] <mdiamond> not a fire obviously but stuff like this could confuse newbies
[20:53:12] <systemfault> I don't, but if #jquery-content is the channel for that, do it :)
[20:53:17] <systemfault> It will help us all
[20:55:51] <mdiamond> okey doke
[22:20:42] <wheatthins> I see a lot of jQuery plugins online that act as rating systems for implementation on a website. However, I am unable to find one that implements user verification, or at the least, good tracking
[22:21:43] <reisio> verification of what exactly?
[22:21:52] <reisio> that a person is logged in as a user as authenticated by FOO?
[22:38:13] <wheatthins> reisio, that a user is unique and not voting twice
[22:38:20] <wheatthins> e.g. with Facebook login
[22:38:31] <wheatthins> Even if it isn't bulletproof, something is better than nothing
[23:49:07] <ling2> hi according to this post http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/182621/why-does-the-php-code-entered-via-my-content-editor-not-get-executed-and-shown-w. does anyone know why <?php replaced by <!--?php?
[23:52:55] <reisio> ...
[23:52:59] <reisio> wrong channel?
[23:53:08] <reisio> and don't cross post, either
[23:56:45] <ling2> but i can't find php channel.
[23:57:10] <ling2> do we have php channel? thanks
