[02:05:18] <SimpleName> I want to draw an flash circalar in canvas, how to implement it
[02:12:54] <iateadonut> the focusout event is triggering when i click on a button in a form within the window.  i do not expect this behavior - i would expect it only when clicking outside the window.
[02:21:55] <iateadonut> there is a click even on the button that i'm pushing that triggers $(window).on('focusout')... i changed it to $(window).on('blur) and that seems to work now.
[02:22:08] <iateadonut> found the answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4628710/dom-problem-with-click-initiating-a-focusout-event-on-a-different-input
[03:05:05] <Krisostoomus> hey
[03:05:06] <Krisostoomus> sup?
[09:45:56] <kpoman> hello everyone ! am trying to get a selected option text and value when selected. I tried this: sel.change(function() { alert(sel.filter(':selected').text());}); ... it is alerting but empty text
[09:46:06] <kpoman> sel is the select object
[09:46:33] <shoky> kpoman: you want .find, not .filter
[09:46:50] <shoky> or .children
[09:47:04] <kpoman> shoky: thanks it worked ! why ?
[09:47:33] <shoky> kpoman: .filter only looks at the selected element, not its children. .find looks at children/descendants
[09:47:47] <shoky> kpoman:  and sel is the <select> but you're looking for its children, the <option>'s
[09:48:17] <kpoman> shoky: great ! and how does it handle multiple options ? would I need to use .each ?
[09:48:20] <shoky> sel.children().filter(':selected')  would work too
[09:48:58] <shoky> kpoman: i think so yea. though .text() might concatenate them for you if that's enough..
[09:48:58] <nikio_> hello, i have this weird bug with jquerymobile. I click on a search button after which it is supposed to change to results page.. but everynow and again it automatically switches back to the search page
[09:49:08] <nikio_> this is the stack trace in which you can see it happening: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d6205942fa8532b8303912472a9bf288
[09:49:36] <kpoman> shoky: thanks !
[09:49:42] <shoky> shure
[09:49:57] <nikio_> so im trying to fiugre out what could trigger this bug.. but im not sure what the e and j function calls are
[09:59:45] <zampa> So i have a div populated by a ul /li and im trying to scroll to top/bottom on a new entry..
[10:00:17] <zampa> var d = $('#chat-messages'); d.scrollTop(d.prop("scrollHeight")); running that but nothing seems to be happeing (#chat-messages is the div)
[10:30:08] <anew> https://jsfiddle.net/L21r31a2/ how can i change the top to the bottom with jquery? really easy question i think
[10:33:15] <Forbidd3n> I keep trying different methods and nothing seems to work across the board. What is the best way to force and input field to show the zero on 2 digit decimals?
[10:33:24] <Forbidd3n> From 5.4 to 5.40
[10:33:58] <Forbidd3n> .toFixed(...) doesn't work
[10:43:07] <Es0teric> so, this is just theory but i have a click handler that i no longer want to be a click handler and what it does is display a bunch of elements.. how would i approach that? should i just grab all of the divs and output each selected element on there?
[10:43:50] <GanzAndere> https://bpaste.net/show/b187a3ed6896 <- I wrote a radio. Can it be made better? Ideas? https://psychedelicsdaily.com/radio/ <- I don't know where to ask. I'm sure my code could be written better.
[11:10:35] <nik_rabon> hello
[11:10:37] <nik_rabon> can someone recommend a good scrollsnap plugin?
[11:59:08] <l33n> if I have a cookie from a browser from one of my laptops, can i copy it into the browser of another computer and access the same page?
[11:59:38] <MikeD_> l33n: try it and see
[11:59:55] <l33n> well i don't know how to try it the right way
[12:00:04] <l33n> like do i append it to the end of a url
[12:00:13] <MikeD_> i could make the case that it could, but also know reasons why it won't
[12:00:45] <MikeD_> you'll want to copy the cookie file from one computer to the appropriate file location on the other computer
[12:02:56] <l33n> MikeD_ what would i do with the cookie to try?
[12:03:03] <MikeD_> copy the file
[12:03:15] <MikeD_> that's all you can do
[12:03:27] <MikeD_> you know what a cookie is / how it works, right?
[12:04:02] <l33n> more or less it's a secret that a client gets that is also kept on a server
[12:04:10] <l33n> ?
[12:05:06] <MikeD_> nope.  it's a text file with a few bytes of name/value data (or less) in it... and the browser sends it with the request to the site
[12:05:18] <MikeD_> you can read them with a text editor
[12:06:22] <l33n> it sends it to a site, and if that name value pair matches one in it's database it generates a particular session
[12:06:59] <MikeD_> yeah, in that specific case of a "session cookie" that'd be true
[12:07:26] <MikeD_> in the more generic sense a cookie is what you get when the server says "Hey, remind me of this next time you call"
[12:08:11] <MikeD_> javascript is also able to create a cookie that gets passed to the server
[12:08:53] <MikeD_> for all the hysteria about cookies that happened in history of the internet, it's really a low-tech hack around the intended stateless nature of www
[12:09:08] <l33n> yeah
[12:09:56] <MikeD_> i wonder if british browsers refer to them as biscuits
[12:10:50] <l33n> i feel like it was invented by a brit

[12:38:01] <Neo_122> hi, how start prapogation after stopped ?
[12:38:23] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[12:38:25] <Neo_122> propagation after stopped ?
[12:38:43] <Neo_122> I need make ajax request and check user is logged or not
[12:39:01] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to stop propagation for this?
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> *that
[12:39:11] <Neo_122> if logged I need add like if not need show him pop-up window for sing up
[12:39:27] <Neo_122> I stop because user add like
[12:39:35] <robertmaxrees> none of that should require you to stop propagation
[12:39:40] <Neo_122> if don't stopped he add +1 to like
[12:39:56] <Neo_122> this require me make stop propagation ,
[12:40:08] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't... mind sharing your code?
[12:40:17] <Neo_122> can I on it after stopped ?
[12:40:46] <Neo_122> there nothing interesting ordinary click function and ajax request
[12:41:00] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there may be ways to work around it, but the way you're describing your problem makes it sound really strange.
[12:41:33] <robertmaxrees> hence why i'm asking to see your code.
[12:41:35] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[12:41:43] <Neo_122> is function which can on propagation again ?
[12:42:30] <Neo_122> robertmaxrees, see code https://pastebin.com/b1suEHjE
[12:43:25] <Neo_122> robertmaxrees, there nothing interesting , I need somehow on propagation again in success - ajax function
[12:43:36] <Neo_122> google couldn't help
[12:57:25] <iTommix> maybe someone could give me a hint. i have this array in JS (https://pastebin.com/9MTaXHFk). I have the values for the first two keys (111202 and 751). how can i get the values after „orte“ (means the values 667 and 668 with their names)
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not an array.
[12:57:57] <robertmaxrees> you're creating an array and then giving it named properties.
[12:58:31] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: associative arrays
[12:58:40] <robertmaxrees> JS doesn't have associoativ e arrayus.
[12:58:43] <robertmaxrees> *associative
[12:59:11] <Forbidd3n> I keep trying different methods and nothing seems to work across the board. What is the best way to force and input field to show the zero on 2 digit decimals? From 5.4 to 5.40 - .toFixed isn't working
[12:59:17] <robertmaxrees> it's objects are similar but not ordered.  though orte is indeed a normal array iTommix
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> i misspoke tjhere.  kind of unusual to great an array with nothing until index 667 and 668
[12:59:52] <Forbidd3n> My input types are number
[13:00:06] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: means i dont have a chance with it to get my values?
[13:00:12] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n http://stackoverflow.com/a/6134070/923919
[13:00:33] <robertmaxrees> iTommix why do you have nothing in that array until 667?
[13:01:25] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: it doesn't work with input type number
[13:01:38] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: this 667 isnt an array, yes? i didnt do something like kirchengemeinden[111202][751]["orte"][667] = new Array()
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n have a fiddle?
[13:02:00] <robertmaxrees> iTommix like i said earlier, i misspoke - orte IS an array.
[13:02:13] <robertmaxrees> and you're setting its indices to strings.
[13:02:15] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: ah… if i use strings instead? like [„667“]
[13:02:31] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that either - what do those numbers represent?
[13:02:40] <iTommix> its an id
[13:02:49] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah, don't use an array for that.
[13:03:24] <iTommix> i want to fill up options with value of that id and name
[13:04:15] <robertmaxrees> iTommix could you share a slightly more fleshed out example of your data?
[13:04:16] <iTommix> i could use json maybe… but i thought there is a way to work with arrays
[13:04:29] <robertmaxrees> iTommix JSON supports arrays, too...
[13:04:38] <robertmaxrees> arrays are still objects, but this is a really unusual data structure.
[13:05:16] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: yes… i know… whats missing on my paste? what do you need?
[13:05:31] <taplar> { elements: { "elementId": { ...element data... } } }
[13:05:36] <robertmaxrees> what's kirchengemeinden[111202][751] supposed to represent?
[13:05:44] <robertmaxrees> like... are you nesting ID references or something?
[13:05:50] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: even id’s
[13:05:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> so you have ID751, which is contained within ID 111202 ?
[13:06:29] <iTommix> imagine i have a selectbox for the first id, one for the second and so on…
[13:06:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:06:49] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/j89vpf4v/1/
[13:06:52] <robertmaxrees> i hate when people say that - "imagine this scenario in my head" ;)
[13:07:09] <taplar> sounds like logic is trying to be put into the model
[13:07:11] <iTommix> what shall i say? keep in mind lol
[13:07:24] <robertmaxrees> iTommix make a fiddle.
[13:07:53] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n so what about this isn't working?
[13:08:05] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: wait… i prepare
[13:08:22] <Forbidd3n> I need the number type field to show the same as the text field is showing
[13:09:08] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/zwxnvkk5/
[13:09:41] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n http://stackoverflow.com/a/7791694/923919
[13:10:01] <robertmaxrees> iTommix but each of those numbers represents an ID?
[13:10:02] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: trying this now, but it is a sloppy hack :)
[13:10:26] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n did you even read the description?
[13:10:28] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: yes… wait
[13:10:44] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: yes, I had this up before you shared it to me
[13:10:54] <robertmaxrees> it basically says "html is gonna always change it unless you do a hack" Forbidd3n.  which means you want a text-style input.
[13:11:41] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/zwxnvkk5/1/ as you can see:  there are two „kirchengemeinden“ with several „orte“
[13:11:55] <robertmaxrees> what significance is that number?
[13:12:05] <robertmaxrees> 111202 and 751 ?
[13:12:23] <iTommix> if i select one of these kirchengemeinde i need theyr „orte“
[13:12:45] <iTommix> these numbers i read from existing selectboxes.
[13:12:46] <robertmaxrees> so 757 is the ID for a particular "orte"?
[13:12:53] <iTommix> yes
[13:13:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:13:48] <iTommix> just to remind: the first and second id i get from my selectboxes… i want to iterate the „orte“ then
[13:14:03] <taplar> are any "orte" shared?
[13:14:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, yopu need to slightly invert your data structure.
[13:14:29] <iTommix> taplar: nope… not shared…
[13:15:37] <l33n> MikeD_
[13:15:45] <l33n> so i used the session-token from my other computer logged into amazon.com
[13:15:51] <l33n> using cookie inspector
[13:15:54] <l33n> and it worked
[13:16:01] <l33n> i was in my account in the other computer
[13:16:16] <l33n> but i exited the page and cannot reproduce it
[13:17:03] <robertmaxrees> iTommix https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zwxnvkk5/2/
[13:17:09] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this.
[13:18:39] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: yes… this is another way, i know. i have to recode everything i guess. :(
[13:18:54] <robertmaxrees> iTommix ths issue is that you were misapplying arrays.
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you COULD use objects similarly to what yopu were trying to do before, but without seeng a little more info it's hard to know what to suggest.
[13:20:37] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: could you explain where i misapplying arrays? ok… i compare it too much with php maybe?
[13:20:54] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.  JS arrays are not associtive arrays.
[13:21:04] <robertmaxrees> *associative
[13:21:32] <robertmaxrees> objects are kind of like associative arrays, but there's some funk in there about property ordering depending on the version in use.
[13:23:20] <iTommix> robertmaxrees: ok… thanks for pointing me on this… i have to throw the knowledge of arrays (which i have in php) in combination with JS to trash i guess…
[13:24:17] <robertmaxrees> you're just conflating arrays with associative arrays and then applying them kind of oddly.
[13:25:37] <iTommix> will recode my stuff… :) thanks again and bye till next
[13:27:13] <l33n> MikeD_
[13:27:21] <robertmaxrees> l;ol
[13:52:14] <Forbidd3n> input triggers blur event when you change the input type on focus
[13:52:36] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the trailing 0?
[13:52:53] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: the customer wants it for a visualization to the user
[13:53:06] <robertmaxrees> and why not text?
[13:53:26] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: because I need the number keypad to show up on focus on mobile devices
[13:56:37] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you then.  funky problem to begin with.
[14:05:21] <Es0teric> so, this is just theory but i have a click handler that i no longer want to be a click handler and what it does is display a bunch of elements.. how would i approach that? should i just grab all of the divs and output each selected element on there?
[14:05:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:08:02] <MikeD_> Forbidd3n: that sounds like <input type="number" /> and hope the mobile browser implements the soft keyboard correctly
[14:08:28] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ the issue is he wants the trailing 0 to display.
[14:08:49] <MikeD_> Oh, i was replying to "Forbidd3n: robertmaxrees: because I need the number keypad to show up on focus on mobile devices"
[14:08:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[14:08:59] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok.. i have this -> https://pastebin.com/1pFSDZ0s i want it not be a click
[14:09:00] <robertmaxrees> he's got that part figured out.
[14:09:18] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric so you just wnat to be able to fire it whenever?
[14:09:22] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yep
[14:11:24] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric https://bpaste.net/show/7fcf4f7bc6dd
[14:11:30] <robertmaxrees> your freebie for the day ;)
[14:12:41] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees hmmm that can work
[14:12:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:12:53] <Es0teric> it doesnt matter if i dont use displayReactions() right?
[14:12:59] <Es0teric> i mean not inside the click handler
[14:13:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:13:06] <Es0teric> what matters is what $(this) is
[14:13:20] <Es0teric> sec, robertmaxrees and thanks
[14:13:30] <robertmaxrees> i just modified the handler to take the element directly.
[14:14:24] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees right
[14:15:31] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees damn that wont work.. =_=
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[14:15:38] <Es0teric> i am calling the ajax too many times
[14:15:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:16:04] <Es0teric> its still on a click handler though, my problem is that i need it outside of a click handler (though yes your example does satisfy that) but its still activated on click
[14:16:04] <robertmaxrees> \why does that matter now?
[14:16:17] <robertmaxrees> erm, then clarify you question?
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:16:50] <Es0teric> today i've been having a problem explaining what is happening with what im doing
[14:16:56] <Es0teric> so you'll have to bare with me here lol
[14:17:07] <Es0teric> its monday, my brain isnt working as efficiently as it should
[14:17:44] <robertmaxrees> did you want to only fire the ajax request after the user hasn't chjanged anything after a little bit of time?
[14:19:05] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok so this is how it is... that .button.react no longer exists.. i need to be able to fire that code without that button basically
[14:19:40] <Es0teric> so there are multiple elements with the same class... within a <li>, so calling the ajax on every element would prove.. bad
[14:20:06] <robertmaxrees> so then you need to abstract out the fetch?
[14:20:14] <Es0teric> yes
[14:20:57] <robertmaxrees> so what's stopping you?
[14:21:12] <robertmaxrees> ah, your that.closest bit.
[14:21:26] <Es0teric> exactly
[14:21:41] <robertmaxrees> and I assume you want to do that call once on pageload?>
[14:21:46] <Es0teric> yep
[14:22:22] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 - this is set to worry about an element specific activity ID, so you'd need ot change your API.  however...
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> 2: why does this need to be ajax at all?
[14:23:25] <Es0teric> because its how it was built... i am basically taking a wp plugin that is no longer maintained by the dev and changing it to suit the company i work for's needs
[14:23:58] <robertmaxrees> lemme re-frame that question then: if it needs to run the ajax call on pageload, why not just do it server-side?
[14:25:12] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees hold up you just gave me an idea
[14:25:38] <Es0teric> you're saying i should just load everything on pageload then just let ajax handle the updating
[14:25:43] <Es0teric> instead of loading everything via ajax right?
[14:25:46] <robertmaxrees> what is ajax updating?
[14:26:07] <Es0teric> basically its a set of reactions a user can do on an activity feed... the idea is the user can react or unset the reaction
[14:26:14] <Es0teric> but there will ultimately be a count
[14:26:24] <robertmaxrees> ah.  then yeah.
[14:26:44] <Es0teric> it took me a bit to learn the code of the guy that originally built it
[14:26:53] <Es0teric> but now that you mention that, i know exactly where that div is being set in php
[14:27:20] <Es0teric> so i should just populate it with php first and then let ajax handle the update/save right?
[14:27:43] <robertmaxrees> yep
[14:27:51] <Es0teric> yeah it took me awhile to get to that epiphany but
[14:28:07] <Es0teric> its WP im working with here... if i had MVC project i would have done that first lol
[14:28:16] <Es0teric> it didnt occur to me that i already knew the hook to use
[14:28:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:29:03] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:29:08] <hg55> Any datatables experts here? How can I render data from multiple columns? (https://datatables.net/reference/option/columns.render)
[14:29:10] <Es0teric> thanks robertmaxrees
[14:34:08] <hg55> Found a solution
[14:36:33] <robertmaxrees> hg55 what was it?
[14:45:51] <jtoy> Hey why doesn't this work to put focus on my input? $("input").last().click().focus().focusin()
[14:45:59] <jtoy> I know its over kill but I am just covering my bases
[14:46:17] <Neo_122> hello
[14:46:20] <jtoy> no variant of this is working... I just want to place a blue outline around an input as if I had clicked or tabbed to it
[14:46:28] <Neo_122> who know how start propagation if I stopped it ?
[14:46:49] <Neo_122> I need after ajax request start propagation , how I can do this ?
[14:51:41] <taplar> you don't re-start propagation.  you conditionally don't stop it.  however if you are doing ajax then that's not really applicable
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:54:15] <robertmaxrees> hence why i asked for code earlier.
[14:55:04] <hg55> robertmaxrees: in the columns field, you can pass this: "render": function ( data, type, full, meta ). "full" represents the full object, then you can get the column data from all columns :-)
[14:55:20] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[14:57:16] <Al_nz1> Hi robertmaxrees

[14:57:51] <BillCriswell_> I waited 6 months to use that!
[14:57:55] <BillCriswell_> Just working my butt off.
[14:57:56] <BillCriswell_> You?
[14:57:59] <robertmaxrees> bout the same.
[14:58:25] <BillCriswell_> It's... not bad I guess.
[14:58:42] <robertmaxrees> PRetty much.
[14:58:43] <taplar> you talk about them one day and they'll show up a little later
[14:59:17] <robertmaxrees> ^ seriously.  you came up the other day.
[14:59:29] <BillCriswell_> Was I in trouble?
[14:59:39] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[14:59:44] <BillCriswell_> Phew
[14:59:47] <robertmaxrees> just that you hadn't been around for a while.
[15:00:30] <BillCriswell_> Yeah I've been slacking on IRC.
[15:00:57] <BillCriswell_> On gitter.im helping a lot with Vue but that's about it.
[15:00:59] <robertmaxrees> hell yeah you have.  lazy lazy lazy.
[15:02:01] <BillCriswell_> I get really distracted on IRC.
[15:03:26] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.  fair enough.
[15:03:26] <MagnusVortex> It's not just IRC for me, I often get distra...
[15:03:37] <robertmaxrees> how has the new gig been?
[15:04:52] <BillCriswell_> It's good. Learning a lot.
[15:05:00] <robertmaxrees> good.
[15:05:02] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: hey robert - your a bit of a expert on here...
[15:05:14] <BillCriswell_> The project I've been working on is launching tomorrow so should be exciting.
[15:05:26] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 there are a ton of experts here ;) just ask your question to the channel.  if somebody cna help, they will.
[15:05:34] <jtoy> why isnt focus focusing?
[15:05:44] <robertmaxrees> jtoy fiddle?
[15:05:51] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell_ sweet!  can you reveal it now or do we have to wait?
[15:06:11] <jtoy> i mean i cant hit .focus() on any elements
[15:06:15] <Al_nz1> well could someone please have a wee look at my question outlined at L http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43449781/goole-maps-api-transparent-pass-through-address-components
[15:06:27] <robertmaxrees> jtoy are you getting errors or...?
[15:06:42] <BillCriswell_> I have to wait. I'll share it with you tomorrow. You'd need to be a Comcast customer to put it to work.
[15:06:44] <jtoy> nothing unusual to really say
[15:06:51] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell_ i'm one of those!
[15:07:11] <jtoy> https://cl.ly/3j3L2K3y0S0B
[15:07:13] <BillCriswell_> @robertmaxrees Haha sweet. Do you have your own router and modem?
[15:07:15] <robertmaxrees> jtoy the probnlem is you're being vague and not giving me much to work with.  i could make a fiddle and have that work jsut fine sooo
[15:07:18] <BillCriswell_> or a rented one?
[15:07:38] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell_ i used the comcast unit in bridged mode and run my own router/wifi
[15:07:44] <robertmaxrees> *use
[15:08:16] <BillCriswell_> Ah ok. Not sure you'll be able to use the tool with that but I'll let you know tomorrow for sure.
[15:08:33] <BillCriswell_> All my work has been front-end. :)
[15:09:43] <robertmaxrees> rad.  i'll keep an eye out for it then ;)
[15:11:11] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 so you have a google maps api question?
[15:13:03] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: well thats part of the question, but the soultion I guess could involve js, jquery, html....
[15:13:39] <robertmaxrees> herm
[15:13:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:14:04] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the question?  there's a bunch of statements there but no question.
[15:14:46] <Al_nz1> the question is how to pass through not only the formatted address but the components too?
[15:14:56] <Al_nz1> (without displaying the components)
[15:15:15] <robertmaxrees> "components"?
[15:15:27] <robertmaxrees> and that depends entirely on how google maps returns that data.
[15:15:32] <Al_nz1> street is a component, street number is another, city is another
[15:16:03] <robertmaxrees> does it return those in a payload of some kind or...
[15:16:16] <Al_nz1> yes, a geocode class.
[15:16:26] <Al_nz1> json? lemme look
[15:16:44] <robertmaxrees> then pop that into an object and use $.ajax() to post that data back to your box.
[15:16:52] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[15:17:43] <Al_nz1> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#GeocoderResult
[15:17:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:18:08] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah.
[15:18:31] <robertmaxrees> do what i suggested
[15:19:15] <Al_nz1> send it to backend before the form is submitted?
[15:19:24] <robertmaxrees> that's up to you.
[15:19:34] <robertmaxrees> i don't have your project in front of me and i don't know your requirements.
[15:19:46] <robertmaxrees> you could also just pop that into some hidden form fields.
[15:19:48] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices there.
[15:19:50] <Al_nz1> no, I want to wait until the form is submittted to send the whole lot through
[15:20:00] <robertmaxrees> then hidden fields is probably your easiest bnet.
[15:20:01] <robertmaxrees> *bet
[15:20:14] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes storing the components in hidden fields was something I also wondered about
[15:20:37] <robertmaxrees> unless you have some kind of other data store, just do that,.
[15:20:49] <jtoy> so i want to simulate tabing to an item with jquery. So when an input appears the input is already focused
[15:21:11] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I will give it a go - thank you
[20:33:23] <quechon> guys im able to use the file api to see the file size and name of the uploaded file how can i attach a progress bar to individual files
[21:15:40] <Neo_122>  I need a hero )
[22:51:37] <GoSox> how can I count the number of <div> tags in a specific <section>, but only the ones that are one level deep? So in other words section > div
[22:51:44] <GoSox> hmm thats probably my answer isn't it
[22:52:46] <quechon> did you try children()
[22:56:26] <GoSox> shouldn't this work? $(".ping_box > div").size();
[22:56:30] <GoSox> its not, it's returning zero
[23:05:14] <GoSox> $(".ping_box").children().length; isn't working either
[23:10:09] <GoSox> ok now im confused, it works in my jsfiddle but not in my actual page
[23:10:11] <GoSox> https://jsfiddle.net/588ez8nx/
[23:18:31] <GoSox> you'd think it's gotta just be a typo or something but im not seeing it
[23:53:06] <GoSox> ok so i seem to have gotten it working, apparently i can only use jquery selectors in or after the original $(function() call, not before it? Before it, but after the jquery.js include. weird
