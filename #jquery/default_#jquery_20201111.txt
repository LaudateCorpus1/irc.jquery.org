[03:31:04] <cloud69> shoky! :) nice to see u around these parts
[03:31:17] <cloud69> hope everything is fine, bless up
[08:32:44] <robertparkerx> a button on a multi step form does https://url.hashdev.org/48 to go back for example to the 19 I guess step.
[08:33:02] <robertparkerx> Once you are directed away from the form and go back it goes to the first step
[08:33:20] <robertparkerx> is there anyway to make it so it goes to the last step by using the onclick event
[08:33:35] <robertparkerx> that's on the button in the multi step form
[08:36:40] <robertparkerx> It seems this multi step form is just on the same page but they're hidden
[08:36:54] <robertparkerx> there is a hidden field named gform_target_page_number_3
[10:01:58] <Cork> robertparkerx: you can update the url so it includes information you can use to rebuild the form
[10:02:14] <Cork> robertparkerx: but if the page is unloaded you can't use dom or js state as it gets lost
[10:14:50] <robertparkerx> Cork https://url.hashdev.org/4b I cannot get it to submit the form to go to the last step
[10:15:04] <robertparkerx> everything else works
[12:24:41] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx without seeing the html and the plugin/code used to manage the multi-step functionality, it's really difficult for people to help.
[16:30:30] <relipse> i did a     $form.submit(function (event) {
[16:30:30] <relipse>       alert(1); and the alert box is never showing, why?
[16:30:39] <relipse> I submit the form and nothing
[16:30:50] <robertmaxrees> can you make a jsfiddle?
[16:31:06] <robertmaxrees> could be a bad selector, bad markup, earlier JS error...
[16:47:48] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeee
[17:41:50] <ckb> hey friends, I'm trying to make a holiday schedule for PBX. But I'm wondering what the best "datepicker" is for a date and time?
[17:42:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lvekmsod/
[17:42:30] <robertmaxrees> ckb
[17:42:42] <robertmaxrees> use a polyfill for type="date" and call it a day :)
[17:42:57] <ckb> that has a good time selection too?
[17:43:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lvekmsod/1/
[17:43:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:43:50] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, google has a crapton of options.
[17:44:03] <ckb> robertmaxrees, I love you. thank you.
[17:44:26] <ckb> that's built into jquery?
[17:44:31] <robertmaxrees> html.
[17:44:36] <ckb> :O
[17:44:39] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with jquery.
[17:44:43] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you use a polyfill for browsers that don't support those natively.
[17:45:10] <ckb> polyfill? confused.
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> unless you just need to support relatively modern browsers.
[17:45:33] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=polyfill :)
[17:45:44] <ckb> Is there a bootstrap implementation for this?
[17:45:55] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i'd have to google it.
[17:46:09] <ckb> got it. had no idea html supported this
[17:47:52] <ckb> how do I use polyfill? is it native?
[17:48:10] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/NcH1srD.png
[17:48:20] <robertmaxrees> you will need to find that code and place it on your site.
[17:48:51] <ckb> "find that code" D:
[17:49:00] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:49:11] <robertmaxrees> should be fairly trivial.
[17:49:33] <ckb> I got it... thank you!
[17:49:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:50:13] <ckb> you said "modern", so I was thinking it was a library, but the jsfiddle didn't have any libs
[17:50:33] <robertmaxrees> i said "unless you just need to support relatively modern browsers."
[17:50:38] <robertmaxrees> as in "browsers that are modern" :)
[17:52:03] <robertmaxrees> not all browsers support type="time" and type="date", so you'll need to "polyfill" that functionality.
[17:52:16] <robertmaxrees> https://www.npmjs.com/package/time-input-polyfill and https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-input-polyfill may work.
[17:52:44] <ckb> perfect. thank you.
[17:53:03] <ckb> can those be styled?
[17:53:13] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to take the research from there, yo.
[17:53:27] <ckb> k I research. You're awesome. thank you.
[17:53:55] <ckb> Do you know if mobile works?
[17:54:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:54:55] <ckb> Does mobile browsers (safari iOS, chrome, etc) have the implementation?
[17:55:05] <robertmaxrees> you mean do you need to polyfill for them?
[17:55:11] <ckb> Correct
[17:55:21] <robertmaxrees> https://caniuse.com/input-datetime
[17:55:35] <robertmaxrees> not that simple :) - all about the browser versions you need to be concerned with.
[17:55:43] <ckb> THANK YOU!

[22:12:28] <Braden`> Hello!
[22:13:33] <Braden`> https://pastebin.com/h6VESBt2 <-- I am using PHP, JQuery, etc. and as far as I can tell, my AJAX query is correct, but it does not appear in the $_POST var during submission.  Could someone check and let me know if I am doing something wrong?
[22:14:43] <robertmaxrees> are you seeing the post happen at all server-side?
[22:15:23] <robertmaxrees> also: that form is just going to submit normally - you want $('#testForm').on('submit', function(e) { instead of that click listener.
[22:15:35] <robertmaxrees> and then do an e.preventDefault(); first thing in the handler.
[22:15:58] <robertmaxrees> also async: true, is assumed, so you can safely delete that line :)
[22:20:47] <Braden`> Surprisingly, I was getting a warning about the async not being set, which is why I set it.  Perhaps the parser was being overly pedantic
[22:20:55] <Braden`> Thank you, I will make the adjustments :)
[22:21:20] <robertmaxrees> not familiar with php at all so not sure about that end.  you can also check your network tab to see what's getting sent.
[22:22:30] <Braden`> It does not look like it is receiving it server-side.  When I use the debugging console of the browser, in the "Request" section, it shows the correct JSON string being passed; however, the result from the page is just the whole page with $_POST not being populated.
[22:23:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then it's being sent, which means your issue is in PHP land.
[22:23:01] <Braden`> So it looks like the async request is correct, but for some reason, the PHP is not populating $_POST with the json-encoded string
[22:24:32] <Braden`> Hmm.  Any idea what that could be?  I will ask in ##php, but I would be surprised if someone here hasn't encountered it before
[22:24:35] <Braden`> Using PHP 7.3
[22:24:42] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[22:24:45] <robertmaxrees> dunno php.
[22:24:53] <robertmaxrees> but the client side looks ok.
[22:25:59] <Braden`> Thank you
[22:26:04] <Braden`> That helps narrow the problem
[22:27:30] <robertmaxrees> also dataType is what you're expecting back from the server.  are you able to log out stuff from a server-side console?
[22:27:35] <robertmaxrees> might debug there instead.
[22:28:48] <Braden`> I am getting "An error occurred: 200 OK" which shows that it received the response back (although the response was the whole page)
[22:29:08] <Braden`> I know err and 200 are mutually-exclusive, but thats what I got
[22:29:36] <robertmaxrees> gonna guess that the server isn't expecting a json post - a php channel could tell you more though.
[22:35:14] <Braden`> Aye, that is what it was
[22:35:19] <shoky_> Braden`: $_POST iirc is for regular form encoded params. it doesn't parse any json for you.  you can just not set the contentType for $.ajax,  and send $('form').serialize()  instead of what you're sending. (as i wrote you yesterday :p)
[22:35:27] <Braden`> I am just going to explain my results for everyone's benefit
[22:35:47] <robertmaxrees> hah - shoky with the clutch reminder
[22:36:03] <Braden`> Since it is json-encoded and not a form, PHP didn't know how to handle it so I had to access the body directly
[22:36:16] <shoky_> you don't need to do that if you just don't json-encode it
[22:36:20] <Braden`> $post = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input')); <-- Basically allowed the string to be decoded into a var as an object
[22:36:39] <robertmaxrees> hah, so shoky was rirhgt
[22:36:41] <robertmaxrees> *right
[22:36:59] <Braden`> shoky_:  Yes, and I have that saved. It worked but I didn't understand all of it.  That is why this additional exercise
[22:37:16] <Braden`> I really appreciate the assistance btw
[22:37:27] <shoky_> ok, you're welcome to ask if still not understanding someth
[22:38:07] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[22:48:26] <Braden`> The challenge I am having right now, is figuring out why the returned json string triggers "error" and not "success"
[22:48:49] <robertmaxrees> the error callback in the ajax call?
[22:49:54] <Braden`> Aye, the callback
[22:50:17] <robertmaxrees> show your latest code
[22:52:02] <Braden`> https://pastebin.com/erAhL4TE
[22:52:28] <robertmaxrees> "Thank you, I will make the adjustments :)"
[22:52:34] <robertmaxrees> you didn't make any changes ;)
[22:53:05] <robertmaxrees> kill dataType: "json" and async: true
[22:53:24] <Braden`> The response string has the json-encoded string, but it triggers "error"
[22:53:29] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[22:53:31] <Braden`> In the callback
[22:53:55] <Braden`> robertmaxrees:  I did.  I changed the event and the disabling of the submit portion
[22:53:58] <robertmaxrees> dataType depends on a variety of factors - the server likely isn't returning the correct content type header.
[22:54:15] <robertmaxrees> remove the two other things, as well :)
[22:56:28] <Braden`> I just did.  It actually stopped throwing the error...
[22:56:34] <robertmaxrees> right.
[22:58:12] <robertmaxrees> go read the docs for jQuery.ajax() for the dataType option\
[22:59:29] <shoky_> i thought with dataType:'json'  you dont require a json content-type header, and it just tries to parse the response body as json anyway
[23:00:53] <robertmaxrees> gonna guess the response from the server might be malformed in some way.
[23:01:07] <shoky_> yea that was my guess
[23:05:36] <Braden`> Got it working
[23:05:47] <Braden`> I will pastebin my solution for everyone's benefit
[23:06:37] <Braden`> https://pastebin.com/XpVXr3J0
[23:07:05] <Braden`> Thank you for the help
[23:07:12] <robertmaxrees> what are you getting back from the server btw?
[23:07:16] <robertmaxrees> the raw response
[23:07:17] <Braden`> This has been plaguing me longer than it should have
[23:08:21] <Braden`> Payload response --> {"email":"test","password":"test"}
[23:08:34] <robertmaxrees> is that what you're seeing in the network tab?
[23:08:54] <Braden`> Yes, network tab, I clicked on the POST, then response tab, raw section
[23:08:59] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[23:09:03] <robertmaxrees> that's not JSON :)
[23:09:19] <Braden`> Its not?
[23:10:58] <robertmaxrees> nope.  not the way JS understands it.  JSON is not javascript, which is a common misconception - you want "{\"email\":\"test\",\"password\":\"test\"}"
[23:11:02] <robertmaxrees> iirc.
[23:11:09] <robertmaxrees> might need double \\ in there, but you get the idea.
[23:17:39] <Braden`> Its a json_encoded string coming out of PHP.  That much I am fairly confident about.  Is it possible the browser is stripping the slashes?
[23:18:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.  PHP migh not be sending it correctly for JS use.
[23:18:23] <shoky_> doesnt seem to me that's the case..
[23:18:40] <Braden`> shoky_:  Which?
[23:18:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm just tossing out guesses haha
[23:18:48] <shoky_> it should look like you pasted:  {"email":"test","password":"test"}
[23:19:01] <shoky_> only in JS code it would look like   "{\"email\":\"test\",\"password\":\"test\"}"
[23:19:06] <shoky_> network tab is not JS code
[23:19:15] <robertmaxrees> ah fair.  solid point.
[23:31:01] <Braden`> Thank you both.  I will sleep now :)
