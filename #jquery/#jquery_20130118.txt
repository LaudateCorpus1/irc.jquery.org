[00:16:02] <ProLoser> are events and event triggers synchronous?
[00:21:46] <pixolin> Hi. Don't know what keyword to search for but I'm looking for a jquery plugin that "swirls" some text as in a tag cloud, where you have one phrase in front while the others move in the back and have less opacity. any suggestions for a keyword to Google?
[00:22:20] <pixolin> carousels are usually for images
[00:22:52] <kerozene> does anyone use those?
[00:24:30] <pixolin> you mean if I have an example? it's rather an idea I have and now I search for a way to realize that
[00:25:03] <kerozene> no, I mean do users anywhere actually engage with that interface?
[00:25:08] <pixolin> but carousel is the wrong expression, I want it more 3D
[00:25:27] <pixolin> uhm, was that for me, kerozene?
[00:25:32] <kerozene> yes
[00:25:41] <pixolin> sorry, I don't quite get what you mean
[00:26:39] <kerozene> I'm asking if anyone (you maybe, or someone you know) has found 3d tag clouds to be an effective interface that users actually use
[00:26:49] <pixolin> lets say I have text in a couple of div's or list items and now I want to have this text swirl around in some flash-like 3D animation as you would see that for e.g. a tag cloud.
[00:27:40] <pixolin> oh, I don't see that as an interface, don't even want to link to anything ... it's more that I want to animate some ... uhm ... proverbs?
[00:27:44] <pixolin> slogans?
[00:28:06] <kerozene> I see
[00:28:22] <pixolin> certainly no slider nor carousel (although carousel gets closer to it)
[00:28:29] <kerozene> anyway, I just wondered :)
[00:29:47] <pixolin> but I admit that tag clouds add a nice bling bling to a website but don't give a good user interface
[00:32:50] <eubey> anybody here have any experience w. jquery mobile? I'm trying to send a different value to a popup depending on which link was clicked to open the popup. Whats the best way to go about doing that? href="#popup_id?data_name=value" ???
[00:48:07] <booom> can someone tells me wtf is the oauth_token? where to get that? https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token?oauth_token=
[00:48:43] <marcules> Morning :)
[00:49:23] <pixolin> booom: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth
[00:50:50] <booom> nope i'm in fucking trouble cause twitter has tokens also for making cofee
[00:50:54] <booom> coffee
[00:51:24] <pixolin> probably the wrong token then :)
[00:58:47] <scathen^C> hey all, is there a way to do something like .parent('.myClass'), but search higher than just the immediate parents?
[00:59:34] <scathen^C> nvm: forgot the s
[01:00:02] <IanWizard-Cloud> What's the most efficient way to find only items that aren't visible?
[01:01:18] <IanWizard-Cloud> For example, if I wanted to get all images, that aren't currently visible.  By visible I mean, visible in the view port, not display: none,  or visibility: hidden
[01:02:09] <booom> @pixolin		but where i can take that token i mean !?
[01:06:20] <quicksilver> IanWizard-Cloud: http://larsjung.de/fracs/ will give you the infromation you need but you will need a good understanding of rectangles and intersections to make sense of its API docs.
[01:07:20] <IanWizard-Cloud> quicksilver: basically, I'm looking to use something like the old jquery.appear plugin, to get a page with a DOM that can grow quite huge, down to a reasonable size.
[01:07:42] <gurde> overwriting window.confirm(), how can i wait for user return true|false an not exit the method?
[01:08:11] <IanWizard-Cloud> once it gets so large, it starts to slowdown quite a bit, and I'm trying to resolve that while still allowing scrolling.
[01:08:17] <IanWizard-Cloud> I'll check out the link, thanks.
[01:08:55] <fairuz> Hi guys. How to change icons (ui-icon) color pragmatically? thanks
[01:18:32] <noregret> anybody used the tabs ui here ?
[01:27:49] <JonnyCash> anyone know of something like this -> http://baymard.com/labs/country-selector that works for states/provinces as well?
[01:32:02] <trinadh|2> JonnyCash: it works for any list that you have...
[01:32:22] <JonnyCash> yes sorry I mean where can I get a database of all the states/provinces in the world?
[01:42:21] <trinadh|2> JonnyCash: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openobject-server/+spec/countries-states-and-provinces , may be this might be helpful
[01:43:55] <TF22Raptor> a bit off topic, anyone know how to disable friends from checking you in at places on fb? 3months ago fb changed something and I've checked privacy setting cant see any settings. Any help would be sweet
[01:46:24] <noregret> I have this event $('.flagged').on('click', '.back', function(e) {}) can I trigger this event from another event ?
[01:47:19] <noregret> I mean instead of duplicating this code in the other event
[01:49:59] <shoky> you can use the same function if you want.. triggering a bubbled event doesn't sound fun
[01:53:52] <JonnyCash> thanks trinadh|2

[02:28:21] <Christer> Hi guys, Could anyone have a look at this: http://pastebin.com/pNtasJYu - I Keep getting: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[02:32:24] <shoky> Christer: dont really know that API you're using , and you didnt show what's calling moveDidOccur
[02:33:02] <Christer> i did put in a comment below the function statement which tells when it occurs.
[02:33:12] <shoky> yeah i saw
[02:33:21] <shoky> but a comment is a comment
[02:33:24] <Christer> Basicly, when a user moves around a map (Openlayers API)
[02:33:28] <shoky> anyway mayyyybe try:
[02:33:30] <Christer> the event triggers
[02:33:34] <shoky> maybe try putting  .clone()  after .toGeometry()
[02:33:51] <shoky> geo: map.getExtent().toGeometry().clone().transform(...
[02:34:12] <shoky> just a vague hunch from some googling, i dont know openlayers at all..
[02:34:35] <shoky> but maybe that transform is triggering another call to your function?
[02:34:47] <Christer> nope
[02:35:11] <Christer> ill try something.. just a sec
[02:35:39] <shoky> do you only get the error if you send that data
[02:37:38] <Christer> yeah
[02:38:08] <Christer> im having a hunch that this might occure when that map.getExtent()..... is returning an object.
[02:38:42] <shoky> why would returning an object cause that
[02:38:52] <shoky> you want it to return an object..
[02:39:54] <shoky> anyway yeah break that chain of calls down
[02:40:04] <shoky> till you find the culprit
[02:40:11] <trinadh|2> Christer: what you are trying to get a polygon, set its projection and send it to server?
[02:41:05] <Christer> Trying to get the format POLYGON([coordinates])) - and send it, yes.
[02:41:35] <arussel> I'm creating a div with: "var foo = $("<div class='foo'></div>")"
[02:42:22] <arussel> then I add stuff to the div and append after.
[02:43:05] <arussel> shouldn't the var foo always point to a single element ? (the div I've created)
[02:43:17] <arussel> in my console I see it becoming an array of div
[02:43:43] <shoky> arussel: how about just make a jsfiddle so we can see exactly what you did, instead of talking about it
[02:44:09] <shoky> oh
[02:44:21] <shoky> arussel: jquery objects are collections of elements
[02:44:32] <shoky> array-like
[02:44:53] <shoky> doesn't matter if its a collection of 1 or 20
[02:46:18] <AlbinoGeek> Not honestly sure how to ask this, is there a way to .fadeOut(oldData).fadeIn(newData) (data being innerHTML) of an element?
[02:46:28] <AlbinoGeek> Obviously if it were a sub-element, but I have no luck.
[02:46:46] <AlbinoGeek> s/no/no such/
[02:46:47] <arussel> so foo is an array of 1 elements, fair enough. If I do foo.after($("<span></span>")), does it make foo an array of 2 elements or 1 elements ? (is foo mutable )
[02:47:26] <shoky> AlbinoGeek:  .fadeOut().queue(function(next) { $(this).html( newData ); next(); }).fadeIn();
[02:47:28] <fattest> HELLO
[02:47:43] <fattest> is any1 here
[02:47:55] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: That might just do it, thanks...
[02:48:00] <fattest> hey
[02:48:02] <shoky> arussel: foo is mutable yes.  not sure about .after tho, try it and see..
[02:48:04] <AlbinoGeek> Not quite what I was asking, but def a way around.
[02:48:05] <esk_> arussel, it is mutable
[02:48:06] <fattest> are u good with jquery?
[02:48:09] <fattest> can someone please help me?
[02:48:28] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: Never ask to ask...
[02:48:32] <arussel> shoky: yes, just did, foo becomes an array of div and span
[02:48:34] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: Just ask your question...
[02:48:39] <arussel> shoky: thanks for your help
[02:48:41] <fattest> oh
[02:48:42] <esk_> arussel: i've tried out .after() and it seems to append it to the array
[02:49:07] <arussel> not the most intuitive, but probably from my scala background
[02:49:16] <fattest> i have a jquery show hide, where if you click on a button, it will either hide a text, or if u click on the other button, it shows it again.
[02:49:24] <fattest> but there is only 1 text, and i would like to change that
[02:49:32] <fattest> can any1 help
[02:49:37] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: What, you want the text to change if you click "show" again?
[02:50:51] <fattest> um hang on
[02:50:53] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: You've not exactly made a whole lot of sense; I get so far that you have two buttons and an element you are hiding/showing.  One button hides, the other shows.
[02:51:38] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: You can set the text of an element with: $(e).html('new text'); or $(e).val('new value'); depending on the type of element.
[02:51:56] <fattest> here
[02:51:57] <fattest> http://pastehtml.com/view/cphjvy7l5.html
[02:52:12] <fattest> can u please help ^
[02:53:16] <trinadh|2> Christer: it doesnt gives you what you are trying to get.. try logging it to console and see
[02:53:20] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: Well, what is it you want it to do exactly?
[02:53:26] <fattest> i want another text
[02:53:35] <fattest> and i want another button where it will only hide that text
[02:53:36] <fattest> and show it
[02:53:43] <Christer> trinadh|2 -  Yeah, iknow! experimenting with it now.
[02:53:54] <trinadh|2> ok...
[02:53:54] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: do u get it
[02:53:57] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: As I've already stated, you can change the text by using .val or .html
[02:54:18] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: i know how to edit html
[02:54:27] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: you dont get it do u?
[02:54:41] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: Well, in jQuery you'd .html('new html here'); to change "Once" to something else.
[02:55:01] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: Well, it's not very easy to get what exactly you want when you're typing as if you were twelve and had only an ABC-input brickphone as your means of input.
[02:55:24] <trinadh|2> get those points and construct POLYGON() outside of .ajax call, if you havent already thought of it
[02:55:28] <AlbinoGeek> If you can type "you" once in a sentence, then why must "u" be used in other spots?  x_x
[02:55:59] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: do u see the text "Once". If you click on the button "HIde", it will hide the text, and if u click on "Show" it will reveal it again. All I want to know is how to put another text, another 2 buttons (hide and show), that will only work for the 2nd text.
[02:56:58] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: Right, to do this you will need to identify "Once" (ie: add an ID or class to that <span> element.)
[02:56:58] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: do you understand now?
[02:57:13] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: im not really good with jquery
[02:57:28] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: Then you can use $('#id') or $('.class') to identify it, whereas right now you're applying your functions to $('span') which means EVERY SPAN on the entire page.
[02:58:21] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: can u give me a example and type it up and publish it pastehtml.com?
[02:58:54] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: its really confusing for me
[02:59:11] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: I'm writing an example now.
[02:59:17] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: thx
[03:03:00] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/6NbAp/
[03:03:18] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: This would be an optimal solution, if you have a lot of these texts you would like to show and hide.
[03:03:32] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: THANK U VERY MUCH
[03:03:39] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: you are the best
[03:04:56] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: one quick thing
[03:05:32] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: instead of "Once" I replaced with a YouTube embed code. When you click hide, the video gets hidden (works great) but the sound is still running. do you know the problem to this?
[03:06:31] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: That's something you really should be using the Google Data API for, as it exposes a whole slew of controls such as having one player play multiple videos, emulating playlists, controlling volume, etc.
[03:06:51] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: i just want the sound to stop
[03:07:02] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: or mute
[03:07:12] <trudko> Hi guys how to select all rows from column number two ?  http://jsfiddle.net/qJ3tP/536/
[03:07:15] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: I can't think of an (easy) way that isn't rather hacky.
[03:07:42] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: i dont want to do anything illegal
[03:07:54] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: wait
[03:07:58] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: i got another idea
[03:08:11] <AlbinoGeek> fattest: Right... someone else can help you, I'm off.
[03:08:17] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: instead of hide, is there any other functions, such as delete,
[03:08:26] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: or destroy
[03:08:45] <fattest> AlbinoGeek: something that will kill everything and bring it back/

[03:11:26] <stefancrs> morning
[03:11:56] <stefancrs> changing input type on the fly is not allowed, which I understand. however, IE won't let me change input type of a cloned element that I haven't inserted to the dom yet, what up with that?
[03:12:19] <stefancrs> I do var input = jQuery('input', elm).clone() and then input.attr('type', 'number') for instance
[03:12:37] <MiracleBlue> sup guys
[03:14:18] <shoky> stefancrs that's still a DOM element, even if its not in the document's DOM tree yet
[03:14:33] <stefancrs> shoky: gah. what to do? :)
[03:14:48] <shoky> make a new element?
[03:15:29] <stefancrs> you mean as a pure text string?
[03:15:45] <stefancrs> and then copy over everything from the original (except the type) ?
[03:15:46] <shoky> var newinput = $('<input type="number">');
[03:16:02] <shoky> copy over whatever it is you want copied, sure..
[03:16:28] <stefancrs> going to try this first :) http://stackoverflow.com/a/3057767/562598
[03:17:01] <shoky> i think a cloned element is detached tho
[03:17:59] <fattesgt> HELLO
[03:18:06] <fattesgt> can anyone please help me?
[03:19:05] <fattesgt> I have a simple jquery show hide (http://jsfiddle.net/6NbAp/3/), there is a youtube embed video. there is also an button where it shows/ hides the video. if i hide the video (by clickiong on the button), the sound still keeps playing , even though the video is hidden. can someone please help
[03:19:58] <stefancrs> shoky: appearantly not, detaching the cloned element fixed the issue
[03:23:00] <idletask> OK, I need help for an ultra classical problem but I cannot get it to work... (JQuery 1.9) I start with elements that are hidden in the DOM and want to .show() them. I can select them correctly and call .show() in FireBug, but they still stay hidden. I have tried this in the CSS: visibility: hidden or display: none, and it just won't work
[03:23:04] <idletask> What is the trick? :(
[03:23:54] <idletask> I can make it happen showing them first and .hide() them on load but I want to avoid that
[03:24:09] <idletask> Googling around for an hour trying various solutions did not work

[03:36:51] <nFFF> ?jsfiddle @ idletask
[03:36:52] <bot-t> idletask, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.

[03:41:39] <AlbinoGeek> I mean, the "she" dies every two seasons, it's clockwork.
[03:46:24] <idletask> OK, noscripts doesn't like jsfiddle
[03:46:36] <Aamir> how much time does it usually take to show the plugin on jquery new site when you push it?
[03:47:31] <idletask> http://jsfiddle.net/Tr5sK/ <-- here is the fiddle
[03:49:00] <idletask> Sorry, there was an error -- here: http://jsfiddle.net/Tr5sK/1/
[03:49:24] <CodesStuff> idletask: What's the issue?
[03:49:32] <idletask> CodesStuff: elements won't show

[03:50:02] <idletask> Does a red "Error!" show?
[03:50:59] <CodesStuff> Ah no
[03:51:01] <CodesStuff> one sec
[03:51:42] <CodesStuff> idletask: It looks to be an error in your CSS for the two other classes
[03:51:45] <CodesStuff> vert and horiz
[03:51:49] <nFFF> idletask, read the docks, show changes the css display to block
[03:52:01] <nFFF> CodesStuff, no, he didn't understand .show()
[03:52:19] <CodesStuff> Yeah, I changed that as well
[03:52:29] <CodesStuff> but his CSS is also busting it a little
[03:53:00] <nFFF> busting what a little? His issue is the div wasnt showing
[03:53:18] <CodesStuff> http://jsfiddle.net/Tr5sK/5/
[03:53:33] <CodesStuff> added a little delay with settimeout cuz I'm a douche like that
[03:54:55] <idletask> nFF: indeed I don't understand (I've only been doing HTML, JS and CSS for two days), do you mean that the message got hidden below the text area?
[03:57:24] <nFFF> idletask, no the method .show() which you are using only effects the elements display: property
[03:57:38] <nFFF> you had hidden the element using visibility
[03:57:38] <subdesign> hi
[03:58:17] <subdesign> is it possible by clicking on an anchor, first I do something w jquery, then let the anchor "run" ?
[03:59:16] <subdesign> kind of before filter/event
[04:00:20] <marcules> subdesign, you could use a switch
[04:00:41] <marcules> Like - if the switch is set, preventDefault - unset the switch call yourself and execute again
[04:01:48] <subdesign> hm
[04:02:17] <idletask> nFFF: OK, that is a useful thing to know
[04:02:27] <idletask> nFFF: and thank you for your patience!
[04:02:44] <motaka2> hello in theis website:   http://fa.noondreams.com/%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87/   I can not see the multi level menu effects like animation - arrows and the shadow but in key2persia.com I can , while I have used the same technic in both , can you help me?
[04:02:51] <idletask> I see that the CSS selectors have been changed in the working examples as well... God I am such a newbie
[04:09:25] <dmitri> hey  guys
[04:10:01] <dmitri> i pupblished my plugin to plugins.jquery.com , but it still didn't appear
[04:23:18] <dmitri> ChanServ: ?
[04:24:01] <dmitri> ChanServ:  i published my plugin to plugins.jquery.com couple of minutes ago, but it still didn't appear
[04:35:30] <jammsen> Hi guys, how can i access the span in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/5KKuQ/
[04:37:02] <rindolf> jammsen: $("span.progressbar-back-text")
[04:37:20] <jammsen> but what happens if i add 5 progress bars`?
[04:37:24] <rindolf> jammsen: are you familiar with CSS selectors?
[04:37:54] <jammsen> isnt there a way to get the parent object of the current bar and find in this object the span to the progressbar?
[04:39:16] <jammsen> rindolf: http://jsfiddle.net/5KKuQ/1/
[04:39:25] <jammsen> where the 25% stands
[04:39:30] <jammsen> there i want also update the time
[04:39:42] <jammsen> for the progress bar
[04:40:07] <jammsen> i added more progressbars with longer timings
[04:40:47] <rindolf> jammsen: do you want to select it starting from a different element?
[04:41:25] <jammsen> rindolf: i dont get the question, what you mean exactly?
[04:41:43] <rindolf> jammsen: what's the problem of using $("span.progressbar-back-text") ?
[04:41:57] <jammsen> because all of them would be updated
[04:42:09] <nFFF> so which one do you want?
[04:42:11] <jammsen> not the one the only should be updatet
[04:42:27] <rindolf> jammsen: do you want http://api.jquery.com/find/ ?
[04:42:36] <rindolf> jammsen: can't you assign them IDs?
[04:43:10] <nFFF> jammsen, your not making sense, theres 4 bars, and you want to update which one?
[04:43:10] <jammsen> nFFF: all of it, the jquery uses the <div> class i want the parent object, so the <div> progress and search there for the span and set it?
[04:43:26] <nFFF> so you want to change all of them?
[04:43:32] <nFFF> but you just said <jammsen> because all of them would be updated
[04:43:36] <jammsen> nFFF: there is a each loop, the steping in is running
[04:43:48] <nFFF> you already have me
[04:43:58] <nFFF> just use me.fin('span');
[04:43:59] <jammsen> i meant the remaining time would be wrong, sorry
[04:44:00] <nFFF> find*
[04:44:29] <nFFF> closest*
[04:44:36] <nFFF> ?closest
[04:44:37] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[04:45:04] <nFFF> or you could use ?parent
[04:45:04] <bot-t> .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[04:45:33] <nFFF> depends on your markup and it's consistency, but only you will know that
[04:45:36] <jammsen> nFFF: then me.find('span').closest().html(secToStr(remain-cursec)); should do the job?
[04:45:42] <nFFF> no find
[04:45:46] <nFFF> fidn is the wrong method
[04:46:32] <jammsen> nFFF: me.closest('span').html(secToStr(remain-cursec));
[04:46:37] <jammsen> right?
[04:46:38] <nFFF> yes
[04:46:41] <nFFF> ?tias
[04:46:41] <b-ot> nFFF, Try it and see
[04:46:41] <bot-t> Try It And See
[04:46:49] <jammsen> it doesnt work
[04:47:30] <jammsen> because im inside the <div class="bar">....</div> the <div class="progress">.....</div> is on level higher
[04:47:39] <jammsen> in the dom
[04:48:09] <jammsen> i have to get the parent object, or one level back/higher in dom
[04:49:32] <jammsen> nFFF: me.parent().find('span').html(secToStr(remain-cursec));
[04:49:36] <jammsen> is working, ty
[04:52:02] <nFFF> sorry my bad, I read it as the span was a parent when its a sibling
[04:53:04] <nFFF> there is a .siblings method btw
[04:53:18] <nFFF> me.siblings('span').
[04:59:27] <amcsi_work> hi
[04:59:54] <amcsi_work> why are they removing $.browser? How am I supposed to conditionally do stuff that can't be feature tested?
[05:01:21] <seutje> amcsi_work: do ur own UA string parsing?
[05:02:00] <seutje> it's been deprecated since what? 1.3?
[05:03:05] <skamikaze> amcsi_work: it's moving to a separate plugin - otherwise just copy the few lines of source ;)
[05:03:48] <seutje> you can prolly copy most of it from jquery source or http://jquery.thewikies.com/browser/
[05:07:46] <tankblergh> hi peeps! I'm having a problem with calling an MVC controller method from ajax with the right parameter. The data I'm sending is a strucutre of a string, an int and an array of objects (a string and int). I'm trying to bind these values to a c# class, and it works for the string and int, but the array of objects stays empty.
[05:08:34] <tankblergh> ata: $.toDictionary(...
[05:09:48] <tankblergh> Do you know you can send an array which elements contain another array and bind these to a list of objects that contain another list?
[05:11:00] <tankblergh> how*
[05:11:33] <reloadz> hi! weird stuff - I load page after page is loaded site creates two divs that i have no idea where they come from! as far as understand it should be jquery problem! one id the mysterious div has id="_GPL_e6a00_parent_div"; Have you ever got that kind of problem?
[05:11:34] <tankblergh> hmm, maybe I should take this in ##javascript instead:)
[05:13:58] <GoSox> i'm looking for some very basic ajax form demos, stuff that only uses straight jquery, not any plugins
[05:14:42] <GoSox> nevermind i found what i need
[05:14:47] <GoSox> google is not a huge fan of jquery.com
[05:17:27] <tlkr> google is better than the jquery search
[05:18:04] <tlkr> and tankblergh as far as I can tell your question relates to ASP and c#, so here is probably not the best place.
[05:18:25] <tlkr> reloadz, is your problem happening on a public page? and no I have never seen that happen before.
[05:18:59] <alexandernst_> I'm using Resizable and minWidth, but it doesn't seem to work. Note that MinHeight is working. I have tried with jquery 1.8.3 and 1.9 and jquerui 1.9.x and 1.10
[05:19:13] <alexandernst_> is there anything else I need to set for minWidth to work properly?
[05:20:02] <skamikaze> alexandernst_: resizable on what?
[05:20:05] <skamikaze> ui dialog?
[05:20:21] <alexandernst_> on $(document)
[05:20:28] <alexandernst_> orr, sorry
[05:20:37] <skamikaze> :P
[05:20:47] <alexandernst_> on a div inside the body, which acts like the body itself :p
[05:21:05] <alexandernst_> ergo, we could say that the div is the document as there isn't anything outside that div
[05:21:42] <skamikaze> alexandernst_: http://jqueryui.com/resizable/#max-min
[05:21:55] <skamikaze> alexandernst_: if it's not working a jsfiddle would be nice
[05:22:58] <alexandernst_> well... the example at that page works (I was expecting that :p) but mine doesn't, and I'm doing pretty much the same. Anyways, let me try to setup a jsfiddle
[05:23:35] <alexandernst_> HA!
[05:23:37] <alexandernst_> no need
[05:23:44] <alexandernst_> I just found THE bug
[05:24:20] * skamikaze can't wait for the description ;)
[05:24:22] <alexandernst_> I have handlers for all sides (handles: 'all'). If I start resizing from SE everything works fine, but resizing from any other side will fail
[05:25:08] <alexandernst_> let me try to copy the example from resizable and try to reproduce the bug
[05:27:10] <Nebros> hi all
[05:27:46] <alexandernst_> ok, it's not that... it does work in a simple jsfiddle
[05:27:57] <alexandernst_> hmmm
[05:29:14] <alexandernst_> well... I handle the resize myself... maybe...
[05:30:54] <amcsi_work> <skamikaze> oh, ok
[05:31:30] <reloadz> tlkr: what do you mean by "public page"?
[05:32:17] <skamikaze> alexandernst_: happens ;) happy debugging dude
[05:32:27] <tlkr> reloadz, can you give me the link to the page where it's happening
[05:32:37] <reloadz> nope :D
[05:32:48] <alexandernst_> skamikaze: :P
[05:32:52] <alexandernst_> skamikaze: thank you :)
[05:35:03] <Tales1> hmmm, everything is failing, now http is not working either with f18aaa
[05:35:39] <skamikaze> ohnoes no http inside a f18 machine?
[05:41:12] <shoky> reloadz: i think that shit comes from some add-on you've got
[05:41:30] <Mugeo> Hi guys! Has anyone used nivo slider with wordpress before?
[05:43:01] <kerozene> Mugeo: no, I don't think that's been tried yet
[05:43:55] <Mugeo> kerozene: well I think it has... at the very least by me... and I'm having a butt-load of trouble
[05:44:40] <harami> hello, i am using jquery to display two lines here is the demo http://jsfiddle.net/5R47g/1/ how can i make line 2 appear after line 1 has finished its function
[05:48:41] <shoky> harami: add one more setTimeout ?
[05:50:15] <shoky> harami: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5R47g/3/
[06:06:12] <harami> hello, i am using jquery to display two lines here is the demo http://jsfiddle.net/5R47g/1/ how can i make line 2 appear after line 1 has finished its function
[06:10:09] <shoky> harami: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5R47g/3/
[06:10:40] <harami> shoky: you were quicker than me thanks
[06:12:51] <GoSox> About javascript's host limits on http requests, does it have to be the same full host as the current page, or can i use different subdomains? For example, could I have www.example.com and m.example.com, all doing ajax requests that load data from data.example.com ?
[06:19:27] <aro> is there a way to determine what form fields have been changed with jquery?
[06:19:42] <harami> yes
[06:20:10] <aro> how?\
[06:21:12] <Sentaur> Hi.
[06:21:30] <aro> hai
[06:21:37] <aro> isnt it supposed to be Centaur?
[06:21:47] <CodesStuff> HELLO. MY NAME IS JEROME. HOW DO I JQUERY?
[06:22:32] <CodesStuff> Anyways, jsfiddle the code in question Sentaur, then paste it with your question/problem.
[06:22:34] <Sentaur> aro: nah, I'm more original than that :P
[06:22:38] <aro> :P
[06:22:43] <CodesStuff> Also, yolo.
[06:22:47] <aro> shut up
[06:22:49] <aro> i hate yolo
[06:22:55] <aro> that guy needs to be imprisoned
[06:23:02] <CodesStuff> How can you hate yolo?
[06:23:10] <CodesStuff> It's inspiring.
[06:23:11] <aro> it doesnt apply to cats
[06:23:31] <CodesStuff> I've strangled many cats. Unless all of them were on their 9th life, I disagree.
[06:24:29] <aro> how do you determine what fields in a form have been changed?
[06:24:58] <CodesStuff> onchange?
[06:25:16] <Sentaur> Got a huge jquery object which I'm looking around in using the chrome debugger. But it's a pain to have to expand all the nodes one by one. is there any way to expand all nodes? or better yet, print the entire object to a string so that I can check it out in a text editor?
[06:25:20] <CodesStuff> er .change, rather
[06:25:21] <aro> im binding to all elements of a form
[06:25:27] <Sentaur> tried JSON.stringify but got an error cause of circular references
[06:25:34] <aro> but if they change it back to the ORIGINAL state, i want the message to go away
[06:25:49] <CodesStuff> aro: formdata, then?
[06:25:57] * aro stares blankly
[06:26:11] <CodesStuff> Sentaur: for loop, append to buffer, print?
[06:28:41] <Sentaur> CodesStuff: the loop will probably get struck due to circular references. any way to avoid that?
[06:29:30] <CodesStuff> You can't just iterate through them? I really don't get what you mean. Objects were created so you can access/call data very, very easily.
[06:29:34] <Sentaur> (without doing something like setting a max depth..cause I'm not sure how many levels I would need)
[06:29:39] <CodesStuff> I'm wondering how you created a bug to prevent that lol
[06:31:45] <Sentaur> CodeStuff: The object I've got is a response from a service so it's not my creation :P
[06:36:35] <CodesStuff> I see
[06:36:41] <CodesStuff> so iterate through what you can
[06:36:49] <CodesStuff> then dump what you can
[06:36:55] <CodesStuff> just break after X level
[07:01:45] <Mottie> Is the plugin registry taking 8 hours to update?
[07:04:38] <tgodar> sick of buggy UI stuff :( ... why would making a datetimepicker readonly change the format and not show the time part
[07:05:21] <mikecmpbll> a click event that i wrote is firing twice for every click and i can't work out why for the life of me.
[07:05:39] <mikecmpbll> can anyone give me some tips on debugging it because i can't even replicate it in a jsfiddle
[07:05:49] <mikecmpbll> driving me slowly insane.
[07:15:07] <Taggnostr> is $([span, element]).addClass("invalid"); correct if I want to add the same class to two elements?
[07:16:25] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr: What are span and element?
[07:16:37] <Taggnostr> two jquery objects
[07:17:18] <BillCriswell> Ah... not too sure that would work. I'd have to mess with it. I know span.add(element).addClass('invalid') would.
[07:17:35] <BillCriswell> It doesn't seem like it would, though.
[07:18:03] <Taggnostr> yep, I'm trying but it doesn't seem to work
[07:20:30] <Taggnostr> span.add(element).addClass('invalid') seems to work fine though
[07:21:31] <BillCriswell> Yeah but if you want to add more than one it could get weird.
[07:23:42] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr: You can do $( [ element[0], span[0] ] ).addClass('invalid')
[07:24:43] <Taggnostr> BillCriswell, ok
[07:24:46] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/aqesih/1/edit What I was working with.
[07:26:36] <BillCriswell> Thinking about this a bit more.. .and that's kind of dumb.
[07:27:02] <Taggnostr> it looks a bit hackish
[07:27:12] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[07:27:21] <BillCriswell> Oh well guess .add() is good enough for now haha.
[07:30:43] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr: $.each() might be your best bet lol.
[07:30:55] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/aqesih/1/edit
[07:31:56] <Taggnostr> add seems the best option here, since I only have two elements
[07:32:06] <Taggnostr> but thanks for the answers :)
[07:35:17] <BillCriswell> Taggnostr: Well, you know the deal if you need more than two haha. No problem!
[07:35:31] <Taggnostr> yep, thanks again
[07:38:19] <aknosis> plugins site says to go to #jquery-content for help but this channel doesn't exists... anyone know the best way to find out issues with publishing a plugin  to http://plugins.jquery.com?
[07:38:43] <edgarjs> not sure but I also have a problem publishing a plugin
[07:39:01] <Mottie> it looks like it's taking 8 hours to update =(
[07:39:13] <edgarjs> well it's been a day for me now
[07:39:32] <aknosis> If you look at recently updated plugins and then look at the repos it's actually quite recent - i think it's just a timezone display issue
[07:40:15] <aknosis> meaning when I look at the repo (logged in) to github I see a repo that's only a few minutes old that way recent pushed/updated
[07:41:37] <edgarjs> mine doesn't even get pushed
[07:42:03] <edgarjs> should be good to have some sort of notification that lets you know if there was an error or it was successfull
[07:42:15] <Mottie> mine either... I don't see anything happening when I click on test hook
[07:42:49] <aknosis> I'm not sure you're supposed to see anything - but I don't really know
[07:43:42] <tgodar> anyone have experience making a datetimepicker read only?  I have got it so it is not mutable but now when setting value programatically the format is wrong and it shows no time part
[07:44:15] <tgodar> ...where did I cuss?
[07:44:25] <aknosis> lol
[07:44:35] <Mottie> make a demo?
[07:44:47] <Mottie> o.O
[07:45:00] <tgodar> join dojo
[07:45:18] <SlexAxton> bot-t: tell Fenikkusu it's because (typeof fn) does not always === 'function' - so toString is preferred.
[07:45:19] <bot-t> SlexAxton, Okay.
[07:46:05] <jklaus> hey guys.  Anyone know how to get an input in IE to trigger onchange event when enter is pressed?
[07:46:12] <jklaus> or how to trigger anything when trigger is pressed?
[07:46:43] <jklaus> what?
[07:46:54] <jklaus> bullshit?
[07:47:12] <aknosis> Is zoozanaghe spamming you too>?
[07:47:18] <jklaus> indeed
[07:47:24] <aknosis> yay
[07:47:32] * Mottie slaps zoozanaghe around a bit with a large trout
[07:47:35] <jarr0dsz> hi guys any idea why this fails  http://jsfiddle.net/ftLDG/ ?
[07:47:47] <jarr0dsz> its qtip wich i cannot include in jsfiddle but i can the hover and the alert just clicks won't work
[07:47:53] <rindolf> jarr0dsz: let me see.
[07:47:53] <jarr0dsz> tried to fix this for almost an hour now
[07:47:55] <jklaus> aknosis, why doesn't he show on the user list?
[07:48:21] <aknosis> I see him
[07:48:29] <jarr0dsz> rindolf: the idea is you hover to get qtip wich works fine in the live site + a click on the div should redirect to user profile but it fails
[07:48:39] <jarr0dsz> seems the                     event.preventDefault(); is not working
[07:48:54] <rindolf> jarr0dsz: OK.
[07:49:21] <rindolf> aknosis: he spams me too.
[07:49:55] <jklaus> eh i ignored him
[07:50:03] <jarr0dsz> argh it seems i have to *remove* that                     event.preventDefault(); instead ;s
[07:51:00] <jklaus> alright.. back to the discussion at hand
[07:51:27] <jklaus> everyone.. type this: " /ignore zoozanaghe all "
[07:51:43] <jklaus> makes life much better
[07:52:25] <jklaus> Does anyone in here now how to get IE to trigger when enter is pressed in an input?
[07:52:35] <jklaus> onchange does not trigger on enter in IE
[07:53:22] <Fenikkusu> I've recently seen the this code several times: return Object.prototype.toString.call(varArray) == '[object Array]'; Can someone explain what the difference between doing this and return 'Array' == (typeof varArray)?
[07:53:22] <bot-t> (8 mins 3 secs ago) <SlexAxton> tell Fenikkusu it's because (typeof fn) does not always === 'function' - so toString is preferred.
[07:53:35] <Mottie> just use mouseup and check e.which === 13
[07:55:10] <systemfault> Fenikkusu: In some cases, you won't get Array back :/
[07:55:23] <Fenikkusu> oO That was interesting...
[07:55:58] <SlexAxton> ?eval typeof (new Array(1,2,3,4))
[07:56:02] <bot-t> SlexAxton: "object"
[07:56:21] <Fenikkusu> The bot-t took me off guard lol
[07:56:22] <systemfault> Fenikkusu: I only have the classic example... if you have an array from another frame.
[07:57:59] <Fenikkusu> systemfault, I've never run across that before. What does it return?
[07:58:26] <Fenikkusu> SlexAxton, thank you
[07:58:43] <SlexAxton> np
[07:59:27] <Fenikkusu> oO zoozan must have a bot running lol
[08:01:09] <Fenikkusu> And another...whatever...Anyways, thank you for your answers. Just trying to learn best-practices for js as I'm more familiar with PHP
[08:02:10] <systemfault> Fenikkusu: object IIRC
[08:02:16] <Mottie> so the plugin registry still isn't accepting my plugins =/
[08:02:35] <systemfault> I'm testing something: IIRC
[08:02:53] <systemfault> Do I get kicked at the third time? Let's see
[08:03:16] <systemfault> Lol, spam bot
[08:03:24] <Fenikkusu> Let me guess, bot by zoo?
[08:03:31] <systemfault> Yeah
[08:04:25] <Fenikkusu> Yeah I keep getting private messages from him. Somewhat annoying, given I don't believe any of my discussions just now have been irrelevant to jQuery.
[08:04:36] <Dave2^2> Hrm
[08:04:41] <systemfault> ajpiano: Would you mind kicking the stupid bot that keeps sending notice everytime someone writes something?
[08:04:50] <Fenikkusu> I'm about to put him on ignore
[08:05:07] <systemfault> !op
[08:05:14] <systemfault> Win.
[08:05:31] <Fenikkusu> lol
[08:05:40] <Fenikkusu> That's better
[08:06:53] <BillCriswell> "I want to take my time and do this right." are now on my list of things never to say cause the answer pissed me off to no end.
[08:14:01] <t4nkd> hi jquery -- can someone tell me if there is supposed an event when clicking a select element?
[08:15:03] <Mottie> mousedown, mouseup, click
[08:16:56] <t4nkd> I don't seem to be getting a click event from a <select> element, but I can trigger it with jquery...
[08:17:07] <t4nkd> I'll try mousedown
[08:17:29] <t4nkd> Hrm, that worked -- weird behavior
[08:19:31] <sethetter> Has anyone here worked with Pikaday.js before?
[08:19:32] <sethetter> I'm having a bit of an issue.
[08:50:15] <StephenS> how to make live chat with jquery like fb?
[08:51:42] <grafi> you dont
[08:52:43] <StephenS> why not lol
[08:54:05] <NoiseEee> StephenS: using something like node and socket.io
[08:54:21] <StephenS> hmm any example?
[08:55:15] <NoiseEee> you can get many by googling something like "chat examples using node and socket.io"
[09:06:17] <StephenS> NoiseEee, thats not really what I need
[09:06:33] <StephenS> I need instant chat from anyone to one member, but it needs to work on page like page.php and not on port.
[09:06:46] <NoiseEee> StephenS: good luck!
[09:08:52] <StephenS> NoiseEee, why's that? :D
[09:15:05] <ldlework> What's a method like "serialize" that gives you a dictionary instead?
[09:16:07] <systemfault> I don't think there's one
[09:17:33] <ldlework> systemfault: .serializeArray
[09:18:58] <systemfault> ldlework: that creates an array, he wants an object
[09:19:15] <ldlework> Yeah but you can loop over than and create an object trivially
[09:20:38] <oreth> what's the easiest way to add an option to an empty select box?
[09:22:39] <ajpiano> ldlework: systemfault fwiw http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject does exactly that ^^
[09:22:59] <ldlework> thanks, but its literally 4 lines
[10:12:40] <michaelaguiar> So I am trying to replace an iframe - because it keeps loading, then shortly after load, content disappears, with jQuery's Load function
[10:12:53] <michaelaguiar> But it seems load will load the content, but not trigger the scripts or anything, is this correct?
[10:16:14] <Jon47> michaelaguiar: i was under the impression that it would execute script tags as well, but i'm sure the answer is in the documentation..
[10:16:50] <michaelaguiar> Hmm, it seems to not pull in any images either
[10:20:46] <wroathe_> When delegating events like this: $('.parent-node').on('click', '.btn', function () { console.log('Do work!'); }); How would you explain the relationship between .parent-node and .btn
[10:20:58] <wroathe_> Is it more correct to say that you're delegating TO .parent-node
[10:21:09] <wroathe_> or FROM .parent-node
[10:22:20] <shoky> to
[10:29:12] <jdhendrickson> I'm pretty new to web design and I'm trying to sum all the values that are selected in a form with jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/CTEVy/ Would this be the way to do it?
[10:29:55] <jdhendrickson> The code isn't even close to working but from reading the jquery docs it seems like it's kinda what I want. If anyone could help I would appreciate it.
[10:36:50] <shoky> jdhendrickson: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CTEVy/1/
[10:37:15] <shoky> (click calculate)
[10:37:31] <jdhendrickson> shoky: looking now.
[10:38:14] <jdhendrickson> shoky: is there a way to update the amount each time a selection is made?
[10:38:57] <jdhendrickson> shoky: so .each is all you need you don't need to select them all it iterates through using that? very cool. thank you for the help so far.
[10:39:51] <shoky> jdhendrickson: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CTEVy/2/
[10:41:26] <jdhendrickson> shoky thank you, ill read about .change
[10:41:44] <shoky> ?change
[10:41:44] <bot-t> .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[10:44:30] <Criten>  I have a mouseenter event that triggers an ajax call that loads info into a div. when i mouseout of the box i want it to go away. It works fine, but if i mouseout while it's loading it doesn't trigger the mouseout even. Is there a way to do like.. an if($('selector').is_hover())?
[10:47:58] <systemfault> Criten: Perhaps you want mouseleave, not mouseout
[10:48:07] <systemfault> (Not totally sure though..)
[10:49:33] <NoiseEee> mouseenter->ajax sounds expensive
[10:50:04] <Criten> NoiseEee: it's only really transfering like.. 10 bytes
[10:50:20] <Criten> my guess its less than loading everything on page load
[10:50:32] <Criten> unless people really like waving the mouse over it
[10:51:10] <NoiseEee> heh. well there's no reason the event shouldn't be firing; maybe what systemfault says
[10:51:29] <Criten> like if i mouse over it slowly it works fine
[10:51:35] <Criten> but if i fly over it it stays open
[10:53:06] <wroathe_> So say I've got two jQuery objects... $parent = $('.parent-node') and $child = $('.child-node') and I want to delegate to $parent from $child using $.fn.on... Why can't I use a jquery object as a second argument to .on?
[10:53:26] <wroathe_> like this: $parent.on('click', $child, function () { console.log('Do Stuff'); });
[10:53:36] <systemfault> wroathe_: Because it doesn't make sense..
[10:53:51] <wroathe_> systemfault: Why not?
[10:54:15] <systemfault> wroathe_: Because event delegation doesn't work with specific nodes.
[10:54:48] <wroathe_> systemfault: That actually makes a lot of sense :)
[10:54:53] <wroathe_> Now I feel stupid.
[10:55:21] <wroathe_> So my next question then is what's the best way of getting the selector for $child?
[10:55:35] <wroathe_> In that above example
[10:55:43] <danheberden> slippery slope, slippery slope
[10:56:01] <wroathe_> danheberden: I'll post the function and you can see what I'm doing.
[10:56:02] <systemfault> wroathe_: I think you're trying to solve your problem starting by the end..
[10:56:12] <systemfault> wroathe_: Start by looking at the html
[10:56:33] <systemfault> Then find a root node... and a way to select your child
[10:56:49] <wroathe_> https://gist.github.com/f7ec8fbf585a1bab6280
[10:57:10] <wroathe_> systemfault: Normally I would but this is a jquery plugin and I'd like to make use of the element was selected by the end user
[10:57:13] <systemfault> What is the markup associated with that?
[10:57:18] <systemfault> Ah
[10:57:29] <wroathe_> systemfault: I'll post a fiddle
[10:57:31] <wroathe_> One sec
[10:57:48] <shoky> you can always do:  $('.parent-node').on('click', function(e) { if ( !$(e.target).is( $child ) ) return; ... })
[11:01:09] <wroathe_> systemfault: This isn't a working fiddle... There's a few moving parts but you'll get the idea. http://jsfiddle.net/3P8cF/
[11:01:45] <wroathe_> It's a backbone application and whenever a change event occurs on a select element in the body of the application it re-renders the footer by calling $.fn.html()
[11:02:00] <wroathe_> When that happens it unbinds the handler I've assigned from the plugin
[11:02:14] <systemfault> btw.. be careful with change events..
[11:02:15] <wroathe_> So as a solution to that I'm trying to delegate to the .revenue-footer element
[11:03:02] <systemfault> I mean... change doesn't bubble on IE
[11:03:16] <wroathe_> systemfault: Yeah. I'm not delegating change
[11:03:19] <wroathe_> I'm delegating click
[11:03:22] <systemfault> Ahhh ok
[11:03:24] <wroathe_> On the footer button
[11:03:32] <wroathe_> Two seperate pieces of functionality
[11:03:52] <wroathe_> There are <select> elements with "Yes" and "No" options in the body of the application that cause the footer to re-render
[11:04:13] <wroathe_> Unbinding the "click" event handler I've assigned to .start-over
[11:04:42] <wroathe_> So I'm trying to do something equivalent to $('.revenue-footer').on('click', '.start-over', function () {});
[11:04:42] <systemfault> Ok, so.. what is the problem with that at the moment?
[11:04:54] <systemfault> That should work :/
[11:04:56] <wroathe_> But inside of my jquery plugin I've only got this.element to work with
[11:04:59] <systemfault> Ah
[11:05:11] <wroathe_> so I need a way to derive '.start-over' from a jquery object $('start-over')
[11:05:32] <jdhendrickson> shoky: What am I doing wrong? http://transcriptresearch.com/credit-card-billing/ It doesn't even fire the alert event... sorry I wish I understood this stuff better. I'm trying to help my wife with her website.
[11:05:32] <wroathe_> But as danheberden said that is a slippery slope.
[11:05:40] <Blaster> anyone know how I could accomplish what I am trying to do here?  http://jsfiddle.net/TapRb/
[11:05:43] <systemfault> I guess you could create your own selector by going up the DOM tree..
[11:05:49] <systemfault> wroathe_: I agree with danheberden
[11:06:04] <wroathe_> systemfault: I do too :) But I'm working with what I've got at the moment.
[11:08:04] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  your script starts with:   <!-
[11:08:32] <jdhendrickson> That's a comment? god im an idiot.
[11:10:43] <jdhendrickson> shoky: Ok I removed that, part...http://jsfiddle.net/N3b4e/ looks like that now.. today is the first time I have ever messed with java script sorry about wasting your time.
[11:10:44] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  and put a $(document).ready(function() {    ...   });   around your code
[11:10:58] <jdhendrickson> shoky: Does that check for the page to have loaded fully?
[11:11:11] <shoky> for the DOM tree to be ready
[11:11:17] <Blaster> when I do var positionIndex = [];  is there a way to have it not insert an undefined array element at position 0 ?
[11:11:31] <shoky> it's needed cause you placed your script before the elements even exist
[11:11:52] <shoky> Blaster: it doesn't put any element at position 0
[11:11:57] <NoiseEee> Blaster: sure!  positionIndex = ['something']
[11:12:16] <Blaster> watch the console here, why is position 0 undefined ?
[11:12:17] <Blaster> http://jsfiddle.net/TapRb/1/
[11:12:27] <shoky> position 20 is undefined too..
[11:12:29] <shoky> er
[11:13:04] <shoky> arrays start from index 0
[11:13:10] <shoky> no way around that
[11:13:15] <Blaster> ahh I get why
[11:13:19] <Blaster> because my "new order" is 1,2,3
[11:13:22] <Blaster> no 0
[11:13:27] <shoky> ya
[11:13:41] <Blaster> am I going down the right path with what i'm trying
[11:13:43] <Blaster> ?
[11:13:53] <Blaster> need to reorder the table to the "new position" order
[11:14:22] <jdhendrickson> shoky: Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/N3b4e/1/
[11:14:22] <Blaster> I was just going to sort the positionIndex and then empty the table and insert the elements back in
[11:16:39] <limpc> anyone using the blueimp file uploader? I cant seem to get it to work - I have all the js files loaded but it says $.blueimp is not defined
[11:17:58] <limpc> nm just fixed it
[11:19:45] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  your wordpress include of jquery puts a jQuery.noConflict();  call right after including jquery.. so $ is undefined
[11:20:06] <shoky> jdhendrickson: either find a way to stop that from happening, or  use "jQuery" instead of "$"
[11:20:18] <shoky> jdhendrickson: er or
[11:20:36] <shoky> jdhendrickson: just change $ to jQuery  on  $(document).ready
[11:20:44] <jdhendrickson> shoky: so instead of $(document) it would be ... ahh yes ok.
[11:20:44] <Blaster> Anyone think they can do a better way than what I did?   I want the most elegant solution possible :) http://jsfiddle.net/TapRb/2/
[11:20:54] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  -->   jQuery(document).ready(function($) {  ...  })
[11:21:06] <shoky> the $ argument there is important too
[11:21:22] <jdhendrickson> shoky: is it case sensitive?
[11:21:26] <shoky> yep
[11:21:35] <jdhendrickson> shoky: thanks I will fix it and try again.
[11:21:46] <nocturne7> can you guys recommend me a good jquery plot graph plugin
[11:21:48] <nocturne7> >
[11:22:50] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  remember to add in the $ argument to that function
[11:23:19] <jdhendrickson> shoky: sorry I dont understand what you mean by that...
[11:23:38] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  i mean:    jQuery(document).ready(function($) {  ...  })
[11:23:45] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  but doesnt matter i see you changed it all to jQuery
[11:23:47] <mg983> Anyone run into issues with jQuery Mobile on the stock android browser?
[11:24:35] <jdhendrickson> shoky: I did but it still doesn't fire for me. Front end stuff is so frustrating to me, I mess around with command line programming a good bit.
[11:25:08] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  it seems like that <script> isn't getting executed at all.. can you put  console.log("bla");  before  the jQuery(document)...
[11:25:34] <jdhendrickson> shoky: sure thing, what does console.log do?
[11:25:35] <sethetter> Has anybody in here used Pikaday.js before?
[11:25:49] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  logs to the console
[11:26:25] <jdhendrickson> shoky: Ok pretend I'm a not particularly smart five year old, what is the console? I probably should have phrased that better.
[11:26:47] <jdhendrickson> is it a debugger of some sort? do i need to install anything?
[11:27:03] <sethetter> jdhendrickson: The console is a place you can type commands into and get a response. Also things can be written to the console from the running javascript as well.
[11:27:07] <shoky> jdhendrickson: yeah its for debugging. and no its integrated into the browser
[11:27:09] <sethetter> jdhendrickson: What browser are you running?
[11:27:20] <jdhendrickson> sethetter: firefox or chrome. currently firefox
[11:27:23] <shoky> jdhendrickson: F12 usually opens up the browser's devtools
[11:27:32] <sethetter> jdhendrickson: All browsers should have one
[11:27:38] <shoky> ?ftj @ jdhendrickson
[11:27:38] <bot-t> jdhendrickson, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:27:41] <jdhendrickson> sethetter: shoky I had no idead!
[11:27:41] <sethetter> shoky: Not for chrome on mac
[11:28:05] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  yah its not logging to the console.. dont really know whats up with that <script>
[11:28:20] <jdhendrickson> shoky: it's probably wordpress protecting me from myself somehow.
[11:28:28] <shoky> likely
[11:29:18] <Mottie> jdhendrickson: make sure that only one copy of jQuery is running
[11:29:58] <wroathe_> systemfault: In my plugin I ended up doing something like this: https://gist.github.com/dbbe958ef0521e92e6e0
[11:30:22] <wroathe_> Elegant? No. Working? Yes.
[11:30:26] <jdhendrickson> Mottie: any idea on how to do that?
[11:31:14] <systemfault> wroathe_: Good :)
[11:31:14] <shoky> wroathe_ you could go with what i suggested, no?
[11:31:24] <shoky> instead of depending on .selector ..
[11:32:33] <wroathe_> shoky: Your solution would work too I suppose but I like this... and actually I changed it to be like this: options.selector = options.selector || this.selector;
[11:33:31] <shoky> as you like
[11:35:19] <wroathe_> This way they can call it like $('.btn').myPlugin({ delegateTo: '.footer', selector: '.start-over' });
[11:35:23] <wroathe_> If they want to
[11:35:34] <wroathe_> Or they could omit selector and let it default to the selector property of that object
[11:35:48] <shoky> which is undocumented ;p
[11:36:20] <zoned> anyone ever used jquery.isotope? i'm trying to add items, and then filter on ONLY the new items (so basically, add some items dynamically, and then only have those display) - but it appears as if isotope's insert callback is not triggering? unless i'm doing something wrong..
[11:37:07] <Mottie> jdhendrickson: How are you including jQuery? This is the right way to do it (http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/), not using a script tag to directly link to it
[11:37:28] <shoky> he doesn't have more than 1 jquery included as far as i could tell..
[11:37:38] <samholmes> Does jQuery provide a method for taking a query string "foo=bar&baz" and turning it into an object, {foo:'bar',baz:undefined}?
[11:37:46] <shoky> and having more than one wouldn't be a cause not to execute a <script> tag, anyways
[11:38:00] <shoky> samholmes: no
[11:38:55] <jdhendrickson> Mottie: I belive WP includes a copy of jquery and as long as I'm using no conflict mode it should be fine...no?
[11:40:12] <Mottie> jdhendrickson: It should be fine, but usually it's a problem when code is added directly instead of using a wordpress plugin.
[11:40:17] <shoky> oh
[11:40:56] <shoky> i think it's the quotes
[11:41:21] <shoky> <script type=”text/javascript”>
[11:41:25] <shoky> the quotes..
[11:41:35] <shoky> jdhendrickson: change the quotes to be normal quotes ;]
[11:41:36] <wroathe_> Haha
[11:41:40] <wroathe_> How does that even happen?
[11:41:46] <wroathe_> What text editors do that by default?
[11:41:48] <shoky> editors and whatnot
[11:41:56] <jdhendrickson> shoky: I wtf, i swear i didn't use those quotes! changing it now.
[11:43:00] <jdhendrickson> Ahh it's executing now. I saw it in your console thing!
[11:43:15] <jdhendrickson> Excellent. it's an error but errors i can work with!
[11:43:53] <Mottie> samholmes: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[11:44:08] <shoky> jdhendrickson you got the alert in the wrong place
[11:44:38] <jdhendrickson> shoky: also im getting [13:42:27.124] TypeError: $ is not a function
[11:44:53] <shoky> jdhendrickson: and add the $ argument to   jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ...    <--- that $
[11:48:36] <jdhendrickson> We have alert box! huzzah!
[11:48:55] <shoky> heh too many
[11:49:00] <shoky> alert still in the wrong place ;P
[11:49:14] <mg983> hey -- as far as jQuery Mobile goes --- what are the differences between click, vclick and tap
[11:49:30] <jdhendrickson> shoky: Well, of course it is, I'm the equivelent of a dog being show a card trick over here... but I'm one happy guy right now.
[11:49:40] <shoky> ;]
[11:52:11] <BillCriswell> So my dog didn't really like my card tricks.
[11:52:46] <jdhendrickson> BillCriswell: Get a new dog. It's the only solution.
[11:52:50] <Mottie> My dog enjoys playing 52 pickup... but I still have to clean up after =(
[11:53:13] <BillCriswell> He's a big phony.
[11:53:17] <jdhendrickson> Shoky, where would the right place be for the alert? I'm curious now.
[11:53:35] <Mottie> there is never a right place for an alert!
[11:53:52] <jdhendrickson> Mottie: haha.
[11:54:00] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/3P8cF/1/
[11:54:21] <shoky> jdhendrickson: AFTER the loop, not inside it ;p
[11:54:22] <jdhendrickson> shoky: ah one brace off.
[11:54:31] <Mottie> seriously though.. use console.log() instead ;)
[11:55:20] <shiftins> should $('#tabyo').tabs({active:3}) init the tab control on a specific tab?
[11:59:09] <jdhendrickson> shoky: is amount local to the loop? if so how does the alert(amount) get it? if not it's global right?
[11:59:24] <Ziber> Using $(".menuitem").click(), how can I get the ID of the element actually clicked?
[11:59:56] <jdhendrickson> shoky: If I'm trying to update the amount value that is being sent as part of the post is doing this type of javascript the right way to do it?
[12:02:44] <TelFiRE> Hey. I used this to bind some clicks: bind('click', 'li > a', function()  -- no matter what anchor I click, $(this) returns the parent UL. Any clues? Is this a difference between bind() and on()?
[12:03:27] <TelFiRE> (I'm forced to run 1.5 btw)
[12:03:40] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  it's local to the 'change' callback function
[12:03:45] <shoky> jdhendrickson: not to the loop
[12:04:30] <Ziber> Can I use $(this) to get the ID of the element, somehow?
[12:05:16] <shoky> jdhendrickson: and i donno what you want to post exactly.. but this is how you get the sum of the values, yeah ;p
[12:05:18] <NoiseEee> $(this).prop('id')
[12:05:20] <TelFiRE> $(this).attr('id');
[12:05:25] <shoky> this.id
[12:05:30] <Ziber> Oh, sweet, thanks.
[12:05:41] <NoiseEee> shoky++
[12:06:02] <jdhendrickson> shoky: Well if i have no java script at all, and I submit, it works exacty the way I want it to, the php script on the server takes the forms parameters etc.
[12:06:13] <shoky> TelFiRE you can't use bind like that afaik
[12:06:24] <shoky> TelFiRE i think you want .delegate
[12:06:34] <shoky> (and switch the order of 'click' and 'li > a'
[12:06:51] <TelFiRE> hm
[12:06:55] <Mottie> TelFiRE: on() was added in jQuery 1.7; it's as shoky says, use delegate
[12:06:56] <jdhendrickson> shoky: My assumption is, if the form is submitting a value named amount, and I use a javascript to update the amount object to a new value i.e. adding all the amount values together, it will then submit the total..
[12:06:57] <TelFiRE> I'll give that a shot, thank you
[12:07:16] <TelFiRE> the official documentation is quite unclear and confusing in that case
[12:07:50] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  first of all.. you have several selects with the same name 'amount' ... so you're posting more than one amount anyway
[12:08:04] <Mottie> TelFiRE: is the content dynamically added, or is it always there?
[12:08:09] <TelFiRE> perfect :) tyvm
[12:08:11] <TelFiRE> it's always there
[12:08:20] <Mottie> then don't use delegate, just bind
[12:08:22] <TelFiRE> I'd need live() otherwise right
[12:08:30] <jdhendrickson> shoky: ahh so i need to change the names but have them all be the same class or something?
[12:08:33] <TelFiRE> well bind isn't working and delegate solved my problem exactly
[12:08:47] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  yeah that'd be better
[12:08:50] <TelFiRE> bind is returning the parent, not the element that was clicked, as was my original issue
[12:08:53] <Mottie> TelFiRE: $('li > a').bind('click', function(){})
[12:09:13] <Mottie> that should return the "a"
[12:09:23] <TelFiRE> what's wrong with delegate
[12:09:28] <Mottie> nothing
[12:09:47] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  and usually what people do is handle the 'submit' event of the form in javascript, and calling event.preventDefault() so that it doesnt do a regular submit, and then do an ajax post of the form data (plus anything you wanna add e.g. that sum)
[12:09:48] <TelFiRE> I think the method you just suggested would do seperate binds for every anchor
[12:10:00] <Mottie> true
[12:10:28] <jdhendrickson> shoky: I think this is over my head. sigh.
[12:10:31] <Mottie> if you have a lot of links, it would make a difference. If you have like 5, you won't notice
[12:11:16] <shoky> jdhendrickson:  if you wanna keep it simple.. you can add a <input type="hidden" name="sum"> to the form, and just update its value from that script
[12:13:13] <NoiseEee> jdhendrickson: but of course the bottom line is that "totals" in regards to money etc should always be determined and confirmed by your backend
[12:13:39] <NoiseEee> <input type='hidden' name='cartTotal' value='0.10'> and several other old-school exploits from the 90s eh
[12:14:02] <jdhendrickson> NoiseEee: is that applicable to stripe?
[12:14:18] <NoiseEee> i should think you should be sending stripe a value from your backend, yes of course.
[12:14:33] <NoiseEee> everything on your page/form is changeable.
[12:14:43] <NoiseEee> your form -> your server to confirm everything -> stripe
[12:15:01] <jdhendrickson> NoiseEee: hmm that's odd I've never read that in any of the application guides. in this case if they change the amount they simply wont get the service.
[12:15:36] <shoky> jdhendrickson: anytihng coming from the client-side (browser) can be altered by the user
[12:16:07] <NoiseEee> jdhendrickson: fair enough but everything money/quantity should always be confirmed by your server in e-commerce type of apps
[12:16:08] <jdhendrickson> shoky: Good to know, but it shouldn't matter in this case, with a shopping cart I would agree, with this we look and see the amount deposited and either do the work or not.
[12:21:41] <wildem> Hi, I'm trying to get some help on how to avoid assigning multiple $.ajaxPrefilters. Can these be checked for presence /
[12:22:20] <systemfault> wildem: What are you trying to do?
[12:22:59] <wildem> I'm attemting to do filtering of ajax requests. I add a preFilter, but each time that code is run, it attaches a new one
[12:23:23] <oreth> is there a tool that will allow you to see what events are being listened for on a specific element?
[12:23:24] <wildem> so it gets executed multiple times. I would like to only have one preFilter on each ajax call executed
[12:25:08] <wildem> ideally, I would like to attach a preFilter this way once, and only once: $.ajaxPrefilter("json", function(options, originalOpts, xhr){
[12:25:31] <wildem> each time, it creates a new preFilter and the callback is called multiple times
[12:26:22] <Ben____> So i need to practice with my jQuery but having issues coming up with an idea of something to build…anyone got any ideas?
[12:26:24] <shoky> oreth:  chrome inspector lets you see the javascript event handlers bound to elements , i bet firebug does too
[12:26:35] <shoky> oreth: you wont always find it that helpful tho
[12:26:52] <oreth> i'm aware of those tools, they suck big balls. especially for large applications
[12:26:57] <oreth> i really want this: http://dev.jquery.com/~john/plugins/profile/jquery-profile.js
[12:27:03] <oreth> however, it's no longer avaialbe
[12:27:23] <shoky> there's also http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[12:27:33] <Ben____> any ideas?
[12:28:38] <shoky> oreth: also, what sucks big balls about them?
[12:29:37] <oreth> this is a completely worthless output: http://cl.ly/image/2r3R2K1h3m31
[12:29:57] <oreth> i'd like to see something like .click() .hover()
[12:29:58] <oreth> etc...
[12:29:59] <shoky> no idea what that is
[12:30:05] <shoky> .click() .hover() are not javascript events
[12:30:35] <shoky> just cause a tool isnt the righ tool for the job doesnt mean it sucks balls ;p
[12:31:39] <oreth> that's a screenshot of hte profiler
[12:31:48] <oreth> all functions are named "anonymous"
[12:31:53] <oreth> because they are callbacks
[12:32:05] <oreth> a jquery profiler, on the other hand, would know this and label it as such
[12:32:43] <Mottie> Is anyone else having a hard time getting their plugin to register at http://plugins.jquery.com/?
[12:32:47] <shoky> you asked about event listeners, not jquery profilers
[12:35:27] <Ben____> buddypress
[12:36:20] <shoky> dont really undersatnd this new plugins page
[12:36:27] <shoky> who cares about popular tags
[12:36:31] <shoky> give me popular plugins..
[12:36:42] <NoiseEee> s/plugins../ladies
[12:36:47] <shoky> word
[12:37:56] <hilem> Assume I have a nested tree structure of unordered lists and list elements, how would I go about selecting every last <li> element within each nested ul ?
[12:39:24] <jost> hilem, try $('ul#topmost ul li:last-child')
[12:40:20] <hilem> that always gives me the last child of the first nest
[12:40:21] <jost> you will only get the last li's from lists that are *not* the topmost list... that is what you want, right?
[12:40:43] <hilem> it is… but I'm getting the topmost
[12:40:47] <hilem> hang on
[12:40:48] <Ben____> guess no one got any ideas then… :/
[12:41:09] <shoky> Ben____ make a blog about looking for ideas
[12:41:15] <shoky> spice it up with jquery
[12:41:24] <Ben____> ha
[12:41:26] <shoky> and uh.. write about that
[12:42:22] <Ben____> i could do that but…thats basically just building a website.
[12:42:30] <Ben____> thanks for responding though :D
[12:42:47] <shoky> your words:  "having issues coming up with an idea of something to build"
[12:43:35] <shoky> since you mentioned jquery, i assumed you want to build a website, not an airplane
[12:43:49] <Ben____> lol
[12:44:36] <shoky> gaming/porn site
[12:44:42] <Ben____> if you could do it with jQuery i would give it a try.
[12:44:53] <codelahoma> is there any way to unregister an ajaxPrefilter?
[12:45:01] <hilem> yea no worky
[12:45:21] <hilem> soon as i put the last-child on it restricts to just the first level of the nested tree
[12:45:53] <shoky> ?demo @ hilem
[12:45:54] <bot-t> hilem, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:47:18] <shoky> codelahoma: dont think so
[12:47:47] <aaronj1335> hey i've got a question about jquery deferred behavior
[12:48:18] <aaronj1335> it's pretty detailed tho… are folks here pretty familiar with that api?
[12:48:22] <systemfault> Go.
[12:48:44] <systemfault> deferred makes me hot
[12:48:53] <aaronj1335> hah, perfect
[12:48:57] <shoky> ;]
[12:49:02] <aaronj1335> right now jquery deferred objects will process a done/fail callback immediately
[12:49:13] <aaronj1335> assuming the deferred has been resolved
[12:49:26] <shoky> /rejected
[12:49:27] <aaronj1335> this is different than the promises/a+ spec
[12:49:35] <aaronj1335> shoky: correct, thanks
[12:50:11] <aaronj1335> is it pretty safe to assume that the jquery implementation will preserve this behavior?
[12:50:45] <systemfault> There's no way to be sure... :/
[12:50:58] <aaronj1335> yeah i figured
[12:51:20] <systemfault> But they usually don't break compatibility often...
[12:51:41] <aaronj1335> yeah that seems to be my experience w/ jquery
[12:51:59] <aaronj1335> it errs on the side of being stable… which is a good thing for a library like jquery :)
[12:52:52] <aaronj1335> well cool, that helps
[12:53:06] <systemfault> They did break then in 1.8 :P
[12:53:13] <systemfault> </troll>
[12:53:39] <aaronj1335> they did didn't they? i remember upgrading and then getting bitten by that
[12:54:50] <hilem> so i figured out the problem, the li's aren't always the last element, and apparently li:last-child only returns an li when its actually the last element
[12:55:06] <hilem> how would I get the last li of a list and not the last li of a list that happens to be the last element?
[12:55:13] <systemfault> aarjona: Yeah, IIRC, it returns a new promise now
[12:55:40] <BillCriswell> I can never be a serious database dude. This stuff is driving me nuts.
[12:56:08] <shoky> serious database dudes are nuts, agreed
[12:56:16] <BillCriswell> The data is also horribly put together... so it might not be that bad with good stuff.
[12:57:03] <BillCriswell> shoky: I love putting together a clever query, but everything else is no fun haha
[12:57:11] <jost> hilem, why are the li's not the last elements?
[12:57:46] <shoky> cause of all the <td>'s in there
[12:58:03] <jost> :-)
[12:58:15] <BillCriswell> Damn table data.
[12:58:33] <BillCriswell> Ween is sounding damn good today.
[12:59:37] <hilem> jost: I'm using ember, and ember inserts a bunch of script tags
[12:59:49] <shoky> that's mean
[13:01:02] <BillCriswell> I bet ember would be really fun to learn. Doubt I'll ever get to use it at work though. =(
[13:01:10] <hye> hi
[13:01:18] <hye> I am using jquery mobile 1.2.  I am doing the following:  $.mobile.changePage('_ordersuccess.aspx', {type: "post", data: someorderitems });
[13:01:23] <jost> hilem, what about $('ul#topmost ul li:last-of-type')
[13:01:29] <jost> does that work?
[13:01:30] <hye> how can i pust more than one variable? instead of just someorderitems?
[13:01:39] <hye> post*
[13:01:55] <hilem> jost: ohh that does work!
[13:01:58] <hilem> thanks!
[13:02:06] <hilem> i never knew last-of-type
[13:02:22] <shoky> its new in 1.9 i think
[13:02:24] <jost> just learned about it, too :-)
[13:02:24] <BillCriswell> hye: What is someorderitems?
[13:02:36] <BillCriswell> last-of-type is an older selector.
[13:02:42] <hye> BillCriswell just data in this format "<li>abc</li>"
[13:03:26] <BillCriswell> hye: You would need to do like... var data = []; data.html = '<b>whatever</b>'; data.morestuff = 23; then pass data.
[13:03:34] <codelahoma> shoky: figured out a way: $.ajaxPrefilter($.Callbacks("once").add(function(){console.log("prefilter I only want to run once")}).fire)
[13:03:37] <BillCriswell> var data = {}; *
[13:04:33] <hye> BillCriswell so somethign liek this or am i misunderstanding:   $.mobile.changePage('_ordersuccess.aspx', {type: "post", data: someorderitems, data.abc: someotheritems });
[13:04:37] <hye> like*
[13:04:42] <BillCriswell> hye: Nope.
[13:04:52] <hye> i see
[13:04:59] <hye> so just create a simple JS object
[13:05:02] <hye> and pass the object?
[13:05:05] <BillCriswell> You'd need to modify someorderitems.
[13:05:10] <BillCriswell> hye: Yes.
[13:05:15] <hye> excellent
[13:05:19] <hye> thanks so much BillCriswell
[13:05:19] <BillCriswell> It may need to be an array of objects with key value pairs?
[13:05:24] <BillCriswell> Drawing a blank kinda right now.
[13:05:31] <BillCriswell> Even though I do it all the damn time.
[13:05:37] <hye> ya it could be anything really
[13:05:54] <hye> but simple JS object i think would be fine... if that doesn't work ill try passing it via JSON
[13:06:24] <shiftins> how to init a jqueryui tab control on not-the-first tab?
[13:06:26] <BillCriswell> data: [ { name: "Name", value: "Bill" }, { name: "Channel", value: "#jquery" } ] would definitely work if that doesn't.
[13:06:39] <IanWizard-Cloud> Is there any reasonably efficient way to select elements, based on their offset?  (This will be over 1000+ elements, so using .each, and testing it's offset is less than ideal.
[13:06:40] <shiftins> i thought ({active:x}) would do it based on the api
[13:06:47] <hye> excellent thanks BillCriswell
[13:06:51] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:07:08] <shoky> shiftins: it should
[13:08:10] <shoky> shiftins: and it does
[13:08:22] <shoky> shiftins: what's x?
[13:08:30] <Fenikkusu> Is it possible to use $.fn.plugin = {}, but define private method, while also allowing me to do $.fn.plugin.public and not $.fn.plugin().public?
[13:09:29] <systemfault> Fenikkusu: Yeah, you keep the private functions inside a closure
[13:10:47] <Fenikkusu> I presume that aren't actually attached to the {}?
[13:11:42] <shoky> Fenikkusu:  (function($) {  function privateFn() { ... }   $.fn.plugin = function() { ... privateFn(); ... };  })(jQuery);
[13:12:37] <Fenikkusu> shoky, Thank you. That's what I figured.
[13:13:25] <alexr2> I'm having an issue where I'm doing an $("#abc").empty().append("<div id='def'></div>"), and then immediately afterwards, using $("#def") to update more things, but the #def element is not yet in the DOM.  I've tried using $.when().then(), but it doesn't seem to work.  Any tips?
[13:16:06] <shoky> alexr2: it should be in the dom immediately afterwards.  but anyway you can do:  var div = $('<div id="def">');  $('#abc').empty().append(div);  div.whatever
[13:16:16] <fairuz_>  Hi guys. A little question about 'this'. I have this code. http://jsfiddle.net/brpNt/1/ .. I have doubts on line 9, is it a correct thing to do? Before, I use this.debug, but it obviously won't work.
[13:17:45] <shoky> fairuz_: this is a safe way to go  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/brpNt/2/
[13:18:17] <fairuz_> shoky's what I'm looking for. Thanks shoky
[13:18:27] <fairuz_> euh *That's
[13:18:35] <rjv> Would I see any performance benefits from using $("p").filter(":last-child") over $("p:last-child")?
[13:20:25] <shoky> rjv: nothing significant, if at all.. nothing you need to be concerned with prolly
[13:21:08] <alexr2> shoky, it's a little bit more complicated unfortunately, http://jsfiddle.net/nnXFs/
[13:21:47] <shoky> alexr2:  $.when doesnt do anything for .empty() or .append()
[13:21:49] <rjv> shoky: i thought as much, thanks
[13:22:06] <shoky> alexr2:  .empty() and .append() are synchronous
[13:22:11] <alexr2> yeah that's what i thought
[13:23:24] <alexr2> this.template() returns the html that contains list-container, but it doesn't appear in the dom by the time i'm trying to manipulate it
[13:26:56] <shiftins> shoky: x is an int, 0-4
[13:26:58] <shoky> alexr2: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nnXFs/1/
[13:27:00] <shiftins> 1 in this case
[13:27:20] <shoky> shiftins: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/RGfxv/6/
[13:27:47] <shiftins> huh
[13:27:49] <shiftins> :D
[13:27:52] <jklaus> I'd assume there is a way to .append("xyz") at a certain point in an array of children?
[13:27:59] <alexr2> shoky, for example, http://jsfiddle.net/nnXFs/2/ works, but if i take it out of the timeout, it won't work
[13:28:43] <shoky> alexr2: i understand .. i cant help without being able to fiddle with it myself.. or at least see it myself
[13:29:10] <shoky> alexr2: but there's no way to "wait for the append to finish" because it has already finished.
[13:29:28] <scriabin> I'm using webkit inspector, I'm trying out the twitter bootstrap javascript (popovers).  In the console I type $("a[rel=popover]") and I get two elements
[13:29:30] <scriabin> I try $("a[rel=popover]").popover() and I get an error
[13:29:40] <scriabin> TypeError: Cannot call method '_init' of undefined
[13:29:45] <scriabin> how do I troubleshoot this?
[13:30:09] <alexr2> okay, i'll see what i can do to get a skeleton of it running on jsfiddle
[13:31:19] <kgee> I'm having trouble proerly including the jquery and jquery.ws (websocket) plugin. http://pastebin.com/6dV12Y7j Why is firebug telling me $.ws.conn() is undefined? the jquery JS libraries are included...
[13:32:56] <shoky> kgee what's $.ws.conn
[13:33:27] <kgee> shoky: the websocket API connection function defined in jquery.ws.js
[13:33:47] <kgee> as far as the $ identifier goes, I've come to learn this is a jquery thing, but don't know much more
[13:33:55] <shoky> kgee: where is the documentation page saying to do that?
[13:34:46] <kgee> shoky: the 'client' section of the tutorial here: http://zackhobson.com/2010/03/28/node-js-and-web-sockets.html It has a node.js server, but uses jquery for the client
[13:35:18] <kgee> shoky: it might be a dated article / mismatched library versions?
[13:37:01] <shoky> kgee: and where did you download the plugin from?
[13:37:52] <shoky> and yeah that's an old article
[13:38:18] <kgee> shoky: the jquery plugin from the jquery download site, and the jquery.ws plugin from http://jsgt.org/lib/jquery/plugin/ws/update.txt . I gathered it was the latest stable version, but could be wrong
[13:39:12] <shoky> kgee: that's not even code..
[13:39:48] <kgee> shoky: d'oh... now I feel silly for missing that
[13:40:14] <kgee> must have copied the wrong link from the source
[13:40:36] <shoky> s'alright
[13:41:30] <shoky> maybe look into socket.io  or mayube there's something hipper now no idea
[13:44:22] <kgee> shoky: believe me, I'm working with socket.io as much as possible. I'm in grad school and I'm supposed to be working on a series of 10 tutorials that bring students from the old web standards to the new, with a focus on networking. Apparently having a working socket.IO server by the second tutorial is 'too fast paced for the other students'
[13:44:53] <shoky> heh
[13:44:56] <kgee> so I'm tossing a "here's a very basic websocket conenction" in the middle
[13:45:29] <shoky> just use the websocket API then ;p
[13:47:10] <kgee> Because I'm not a masochist, and I'm playing the role of teacher where the teacher is only one lesson ahead of the students. lol.
[13:47:43] <hilem> is there a common pattern within jquery to do x if on version y and do z if on version something else?
[13:49:31] <BillCriswell> hilem: do = ( version === 'y' ) ? x : z;  maybe?
[13:51:03] <BillCriswell> window[do]() Weee
[13:51:19] <BillCriswell> Dammit I want to go home.
[13:51:59] <motaka2> 	hello - I have a javascript file in this path /Js/Dss/Modify.js and it has a function called function Modify(){...} to create a new object of Modify. Now I look for a way to implement namespace so If I have two modify object I wont encounter namecollisions
[13:52:12] <BillCriswell> if ( version === 'y' ) { x(); } else { z() } might be better?
[13:52:23] <hlve> so random.
[13:52:27] <hlve> http://footage.shutterstock.com/clip-3015502-stock-footage-bunch-of-santa-claus-dancing-against-white-christmas-holiday-background-alpha-matte.html
[13:52:28] <hlve> enjoy
[13:58:36] <hilem> BillCriswell: is this frowned upon?   if($().jquery.match(/1[.]9/) { …. }
[13:59:04] <BillCriswell> hilem: I'd frown upon that haha.
[13:59:12] <shoky> >:-o
[13:59:32] <shoky> bad frown
[13:59:33] <BillCriswell> $().jquery === '1.9' would do the same thing.
[13:59:44] <shoky> $.fn.jquery is kinda nicer
[14:00:08] <shoky> hilem: what are you doing it for?
[14:00:15] <BillCriswell> You're getting a regex in there for no reason, [.] could easily be \. and you're not checking for the begining and end of the string.
[14:01:13] <BillCriswell> $.fn.jquery === '1.9' would be the best bet if you had to... doesn't seem to b like you ever should need to haha.
[14:01:18] <BillCriswell> seem to me*
[14:01:41] <hilem> i want to call one selector if using jQuery 1.9 and another if using 1.8
[14:02:07] <NoiseEee> hilem: why?!
[14:02:09] <NoiseEee> they're compat
[14:02:42] <hilem> cause 1.9 has last-of-type which I want to use, and serves a purpose I can't do in 1.8
[14:03:57] <Mottie> you should detect if the function exists in jQuery instead... if ($.fn.finish) { /* use finish() */ }
[14:04:48] <Mottie> oh nm, using a selector eh?
[14:04:58] <hilem> yea =)
[14:05:03] <Mottie> why not just use css?
[14:05:29] <hilem> I need the selector to apply a class dynamically
[14:07:46] <gnarf> hilem: feature detect the selector
[14:08:10] <StephenS> Why is my modal open on default when I placed divs into body
[14:09:04] <zzb_123> Hi, I'm new in Jquery mobile and I got a big doubt
[14:09:24] <hilem> gnarf: how do you feature detect a selector?
[14:09:26] <hlve> in b4 another language barrier.
[14:09:31] <hlve> :/
[14:09:37] <hilem> gnarf: that does sound like the most robust option
[14:10:05] <zzb_123> Does anybody knows if the mobile devices navigate trough liks in ajax mode by default?
[14:10:13] <gnarf> hilem: one min, lookin
[14:11:10] <gnarf> hilem: actually the way that selector is implemented, you can't :/
[14:11:22] <hilem> gnarf: naturally.  =)
[14:11:32] <gnarf> some of em you can if ( jQuery.expr[":"].jqmData ) for example
[14:11:46] <Mottie> hilem: check out https://github.com/keithclark/JQuery-Extended-Selectors
[14:11:51] <hilem> interesting
[14:12:35] <gnarf> hilem: but the -nth-of.... stuff is all implemented in the CHILD selectors, which are just a giant group with some regexps
[14:15:16] <hilem> gotta run… thanks for the help guys
[14:15:27] <dcherman> gnarf: why not? wouldn't something like this work to check support?  http://jsfiddle.net/b6ENf/
[14:17:18] <shoky> dcherman: why, are you getting an alert of false?
[14:17:57] <dcherman> shoky: no, i'm asking why you couldn't feature detect the pseudo support
[14:18:24] <shoky> dcherman: jquery delegates to the native querySelectorAll function in many cases
[14:18:32] <shoky> if it's supported
[14:19:00] <dcherman> dcherman: yea, in which case this feature test will pass.  it'll also pass assuming jquery >= 1.9 where sizzle supports it
[14:19:04] <dcherman> shoky:
[14:19:30] <gnarf> dcherman: not bad :)
[14:19:31] <shoky> i see.
[14:19:34] <shoky> good point ;]
[14:19:46] <gnarf> too bad it missed hilem
[14:20:00] <gnarf> ?tell hilem dcherman: gnarf: why not? wouldn't something like this work to check support?  http://jsfiddle.net/b6ENf/ -- theres a feature detect :)
[14:20:00] <b-ot> gnarf, I’ll tell hilem about that.
[14:20:00] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[14:23:58] <BillCriswell> The amount of data I had to work with today makes me sad. =(
[14:24:53] <shoky> there there..
[14:26:31] <BillCriswell> shoky: I'm just not built for it lol
[14:26:43] <BillCriswell> I could move around the DOM with ease, datasources, no thanks.
[14:27:21] <shoky> we dont have a lot of data where i work, thankfully,
[14:27:30] <shoky> but we have an abundance of idiots
[14:27:52] <shoky> yesterday i had to deal with 3 tables:  USER_PLAY_LIST,  PLAY_LIST,  PLAYLISTS
[14:28:02] <BillCriswell> hahaha
[14:28:14] <shoky> im still not done with it :((
[14:28:19] <BillCriswell> which one was the right one?
[14:28:21] <BillCriswell> Oh, haha.
[14:28:26] <shoky> all of them :((((((((
[14:28:56] <BillCriswell> damn.
[14:29:13] <BillCriswell> I mean... user_play_list and play_list would make sense... but just play_list seems weird.
[14:29:32] <BillCriswell> users_play_lists and play_lists would make sense I mean.
[14:29:41] <shoky> yea, it makes no sense sadly
[14:30:06] <BillCriswell> users_playlists and playlists is what i'd use probably... if I had to go into the backend and code haha
[14:30:20] <BillCriswell> I like the frontend though.
[14:31:15] <shoky> yarp
[14:33:22] <BillCriswell> Chrome keeps hiding from me.
[14:35:19] <gnarf> BillCriswell: and what about the entries IN the list... seems thats what PLAY_LIST would be :)  a song_playlist table
[14:36:07] <BillCriswell> playlists_songs maybe?
[14:36:42] <BillCriswell> the _ means owns to me.. at least how i think about it
[14:36:58] <BillCriswell> And this week at least.
[14:37:53] <BillCriswell> databases definitely aren't my thing lol
[14:40:15] <gnarf> yeah, terribad naming regardless
[14:40:16] <gnarf> :)
[14:40:30] <gnarf> I just use Mongo nowadays, so screw relation tables ;)
[14:43:09] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I played with that and got pretty lost. :(
[14:44:04] <Mottie> Anyone got a minute to look at my manifest file (https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/Equalizer/blob/master/equalizer.jquery.json) to see what's wrong... it's not registering.
[14:44:22] <BillCriswell> gnarf: When something is easy I have the hardest time grasping it, totally overcomplicate it.
[14:44:45] <gnarf> BillCriswell: hardest part about working with mongo is getting out of the relational database thinking
[14:45:54] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I'm would have a hard time with that for sure.
[14:46:07] <BillCriswell> gnarf: You liking your experience with mongo so far?
[14:51:07] <ch3mical> So, I know Deferreds are using Callbacks, so is it possible to change the options it uses for the Callback it generates?
[14:53:14] <gnarf> ch3mical: no
[14:53:53] <gnarf> ch3mical: what u tryin to do?
[14:54:05] <gnarf> BillCriswell: love mongo
[14:54:25] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[14:54:40] <gnarf> BillCriswell: hate its memory hogginess, but you can deal with it with decent infrastructure
[14:56:34] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Niiiiiice.
[14:56:43] <BillCriswell> I'm out of here. Have a good wekeend everyone!
[14:57:18] <ch3mical> gnarf: I wrote a wrapper for AJAX that caches multiple identical requests within a short timeframe, to cut down on XHR. I want to allow for assigning a "sticky" callback. I was thinking the easiest thing to do would be to remove the "once" option when the Deferred is created, based on an option passed to the wrapper.
[14:58:30] <gnarf> ch3mical: hrm
[14:58:39] <gnarf> ch3mical: so thats generally a bad idea
[14:58:53] <gnarf> ch3mical: at least overriding once on deferreds
[14:58:55] <ch3mical> Basically, so I don't have to have 2 different methods of interfacing with the wrapper, and can still use the fail/done/always fluent interfaces
[14:59:12] <gnarf> ch3mical: "sticky" meaning what exactly?
[14:59:28] <ch3mical> gnarf: it would only be on a per-request basis, not override the whole Deferred method
[14:59:52] <ch3mical> gnarf: meaning $.Callbacks('memory') not $.Callbacks('once memory')
[15:00:04] <gnarf> because i think i'd just pipe whatever "cached" to each request
[15:06:53] <ch3mical> Hmm. I don't think what I want to do is going to work anyway
[15:06:55] <hye> on jquery mobile 1.2 i have:  $.mobile.changePage('_order.aspx', { type: "post", data: strjson });    how do I read the strjson value on the _order.aspx page?
[15:08:07] <therealklanni> hye: that's a question for an ASP channel
[15:08:14] <therealklanni> methinks
[15:08:32] <hye> i see what you mean
[15:08:56] <therealklanni> Considering that what you want is for the ASP to trap the POSTDATA

[15:53:16] <evanx> Hello
[15:54:40] <oliwe> not sure if its ok but ive got a pretty basic question and wondered what this stuff might cost so i can see if its worth doing it myself or ask for help
[15:55:14] <oliwe> http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#constrain-movement i want to be able to drag a box with a image inside and have it constrained to a box, but i also want it to be able to resize liek in mootools
[15:55:15] <oliwe> http://cssgallery.info/wp-content/how_to_make_draggable_and_resizable_mootools.html
[15:55:34] <oliwe> basically have the box be dynamic based on the image dimensions
[15:56:50] <oliwe> a dynamic widht-height box with a image that cant be resized to be super tiny and not larger than the box itself, be able to resize it by using the corner but not further than lets say 25% of its size
[15:56:55] <hye> how come when i do mobile.changepage, the jquery code in the page being changed to doesnt run?
[15:58:04] <oliwe> i just dont know javascript
[15:58:25] <beancurd> oliwe: what do you know?
[15:58:38] <oliwe> php
[15:58:48] <oliwe> and all the other basic stuff like html css quite well
[15:58:57] <beancurd> right.
[15:59:07] <oliwe> been doing php for 10+ years but the syntax of javascript is really messing with me
[15:59:46] <TelFiRE> oliwe: http://viralpatel.net/blogs/jquery-resizable-draggable-resize-drag-tutorial-example/
[15:59:48] <beancurd> js syntax is fairly straight forward. maybe jquery shortcuts screwing with you?
[16:00:54] <oliwe> right now im trying to edit a premade script that uses mootools, but its not that which screwing with me, its that the script was built for 100 other things i dont want so it contains so much stuff like "this.whatthe" inside everything and it creates its own html so i really dont know how to edit
[16:01:08] <oliwe> TelFiRE thanks that really helpful
[16:01:37] <TelFiRE> yeah stuff like that you rarely have to code much yourself
[16:01:50] <oliwe> its just that ive never done javascript
[16:02:01] <oliwe> when i started with php and websites javascript wasnt ever used
[16:02:05] <TelFiRE> looks like someone's already done the plugin work so you can just do $('#some-element').draggable().resizeable(); if you get that plugin heh
[16:02:11] <oliwe> it was for those crappy websites to make text bounce around
[16:02:47] <oliwe> TelFiRE i guess i just need to edit it to make it resize it properly to the dimensions of the image
[16:02:50] <oliwe> but thats just math
[16:03:06] <oliwe> and have it not being able to move past x y
[16:03:29] <TelFiRE> yeah idk if it's built into those functions with the options or not, if not I'm sure there's other plugins out there
[16:03:36] <oliwe> it sounds so simple but when you dont now a language thats actually harder than you might think
[16:03:52] <oliwe> guess i could search around before paying someone
[16:04:35] <TelFiRE> well javascript is very hard to learn
[16:04:39] <oliwe> but i'd prefer to pay someone cause it takes so much of my free time
[16:04:42] <TelFiRE> but most of the people here probably don't know it
[16:04:44] <TelFiRE> jquery is easy
[16:05:08] <oliwe> yes php is super easy, i guess you could say php is like jquery, the syntax of php is ridicolusly easy
[16:05:17] <oliwe> except its with a lib, that does everything for you
[16:05:20] <beancurd> js very hard to learn? i wouldn't say that.
[16:06:06] <oliwe> can you guys suggest an estimate for what im asking, since theres already "libs" for kind of what im asking
[16:06:10] <oliwe> price i mean
[16:06:44] <TelFiRE> beancurd: depends on your background
[16:07:07] <beancurd> TelFiRE: as a first language
[16:07:09] <TelFiRE> but js is gnarly, that's why jq exists
[16:07:26] <evanx> Somebody familiar with bootstrap-datepicker?
[16:07:34] <TelFiRE> it is what it is, it's a lower level language so it's going to be more complex
[16:07:39] <beancurd> js is fine. just diff browsers treat the dom differently
[16:07:49] <oliwe> i really shouldve learnt javascript when it was regarded as stupid haha
[16:07:56] <oliwe> oh im dumb
[16:08:07] <oliwe> before all these libs i mean
[16:08:11] <TelFiRE> well jq is syntactically easier and provides functions that there's just no reason to re-invent
[16:08:16] <oliwe> ~2003
[16:08:28] <zzb_123> Does anybody knows how can i get a json object for a data that i get trough ajax navigation in jquerymobile?
[16:08:54] <oliwe> javascript for me is like anotehr germanic language, i can get some things but its mostly gibberish
[16:09:17] <oliwe> im really not a fan of "this.zxy"
[16:09:28] <oliwe> its breaking my brain on so many levels
[16:09:36] <beancurd> you'll probably hate perl then.
[16:09:45] <oliwe> ive done perl and yes i did not like it
[16:09:59] <TelFiRE> I am ashamed to say I learned Flash Actionscript before anything
[16:10:01] <TelFiRE> before HTML
[16:10:07] <oliwe> flash actionscript is a goldmine now though
[16:10:09] <TelFiRE> so that made jQuery make a lot of sense to me
[16:10:14] <oliwe> with zynga and king
[16:10:17] <TelFiRE> a gold mine you say
[16:10:21] <TelFiRE> no one told me
[16:10:37] <oliwe> well facebook games are a billion dollar industry isnt it
[16:10:44] <TelFiRE> lol
[16:11:01] <oliwe> or am i wrong? zynga makes hundres of millions
[16:11:06] <TelFiRE> only if you're paying people 50¢ and hour
[16:11:23] <oliwe> maybe so
[16:11:36] <TelFiRE> if I value my time at $75 an hour there is no way it's worth it for me to sit and make flash games and hope for ad revenue if it happens to get popular
[16:11:37] <beancurd> that's like saying php is a billion dollar industry because facebook uses it..
[16:11:39] <TelFiRE> in mass, it's profitable
[16:11:40] <oliwe> i never got into actionscript either, i did a loader in it once
[16:11:48] <TelFiRE> because every once in a while you hit gold
[16:12:03] <oliwe> TelFiRE i'd like that pay
[16:12:20] <oliwe> i make maybe $25-30
[16:12:37] <TelFiRE> well that's not my pay
[16:12:40] <TelFiRE> just hypothetical
[16:12:43] <oliwe> ah
[16:12:52] <beancurd> i'd be silly to pick up AS right now unless you were guaranteed to make $$.
[16:12:52] <TelFiRE> my firm charges $125 an hour but I don't get paid that lol
[16:12:56] <oliwe> well i get it mostly because i dont have a CV so i cant get a real job
[16:13:03] <oliwe> im working at my mates family business
[16:13:10] <oliwe> and they told me to code javascript
[16:13:13] <oliwe> i told them i cant do it
[16:13:15] <oliwe> they said "lol do it"
[16:13:30] <TelFiRE> Well, the one other thing there
[16:13:33] <beancurd> what does the business do?
[16:13:37] <TelFiRE> is that you can now make native apps
[16:13:40] <oliwe> printing stuff
[16:13:59] <TelFiRE> for iOS/Android in flash. so it's nice actually, even if you know how to do it natively you can't do both at the same time.
[16:14:10] <oliwe> flags, tents etc, im making it so customers can put their logo where they want on their tent
[16:14:13] <TelFiRE> but it won't do complex stuff, flash just doesn't handle or perform well once you get beyond basics
[16:14:17] <beancurd> TelFiRE: phonegap baby.
[16:14:20] <oliwe> and then ive already written all the calculation stuff in crappy js
[16:14:40] <oliwe> so based on what the widht and height is of the logo on the tent
[16:14:43] <oliwe> they can get a price
[16:14:44] <TelFiRE> Phonegap is cool and all
[16:14:51] <TelFiRE> but you cannot make games with it in reasonable timeframe
[16:14:58] <TelFiRE> some things are just way easier in flash
[16:15:03] <beancurd> oh yeah. games will be crap.
[16:15:16] <beancurd> but gaming industry is weird.
[16:15:40] <oliwe> (TelFiRE) for iOS/Android in flash.
[16:15:42] <oliwe> ios doesnt do flash
[16:15:48] <beancurd> i'd probably say less than 1 in 20 programmers work in games. so we can discount their influence.
[16:15:51] <TelFiRE> you could make some of the games that are really popular in flash if you wanted to. Like angry birds and tower defense and stuff like that. Not like huge-scale, anything 3d, or mmo type stuff
[16:15:59] <oliwe> beancurd that many?
[16:16:10] <oliwe> i thought most programmers was in software
[16:16:18] <oliwe> that isnt games
[16:16:26] <beancurd> less.
[16:16:30] <phizes> TelFiRE: angry birds isn't flash afaik
[16:16:33] <TelFiRE> oliwe: in CS6 you can export to ios
[16:16:35] <TelFiRE> no it isn't
[16:16:39] <TelFiRE> I'm saying you could make it in flash if you wante
[16:16:40] <oliwe> oh
[16:16:42] <oliwe> thats cool
[16:16:47] <beancurd> my perception in skewed, since i'm surronded by games people.
[16:17:00] <oliwe> haha beancurd yeah im the opposit
[16:17:22] <oliwe> i dont know a single person doing games
[16:17:24] <TelFiRE> eh, regardless of how many programmers do it, that is where the money is yo
[16:17:42] <TelFiRE> iOS is the #1 gaming platform in the world. It is more profitable than every major console combined.
[16:17:49] <beancurd> money is in whatever web/mobile crap is popular for that given time.
[16:18:02] <oliwe> i personally want to work with construction, but since i started in 2000-2001 with a website for my cs clan
[16:18:08] <beancurd> TelFiRE: i'd like to see the stats on that.
[16:18:11] <oliwe> ive taught myself programming in php and webdesign
[16:18:13] <TelFiRE> truth to that as well, but you can always sell a good game
[16:18:20] <TelFiRE> or a bad one
[16:18:22] <TelFiRE> for that matter
[16:18:41] <oliwe> bad one if its cute
[16:18:44] <oliwe> and children like the ads
[16:18:47] <beancurd> not that i don't believe you, but i want to be able to be sure before i parrot you in a irl converation.
[16:19:28] <oliwe> is there any industry that doesnt have its bad wolf
[16:19:41] <oliwe> programming is shit scared of chinese and indians
[16:19:47] <oliwe> construction is scared of polacks
[16:19:58] <oliwe> medicine iranians
[16:20:17] <beancurd> i wasn't aware of iranians being a threat to medicine.
[16:20:30] <oliwe> "threat"
[16:20:36] <oliwe> they make really good doctors
[16:20:43] <oliwe> in sweden theres tons of them
[16:20:51] <beancurd> how many of them are allowed out of the country though.
[16:20:52] <oliwe> i like them because they prescribe you stuff you want
[16:21:00] <TelFiRE> well beancurd unfortunately I can't find the source
[16:21:05] <beancurd> that doesn't sound 'good' :/
[16:21:21] <TelFiRE> I did find this though, Epic Games saying their most profitable game ever is an ios title http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120308/infinity-blade-epic-games-most-profitable-game
[16:21:33] <TelFiRE> and they make Borderlands 2 and Gears of War some of the most popular pc games
[16:21:36] <TelFiRE> and cross platform games
[16:21:36] <oliwe> beancurd its not generally good, our goveremnt tries to limit antibiotics, it helps really well sure, but if the people gets too much of it their germs can get immune against it
[16:21:45] <oliwe> but i personally think its good cause fuck being sick :D
[16:22:16] <TelFiRE> Doctor... I have glaucoma....
[16:22:58] <oliwe> why so old
[16:23:07] <beancurd> i need... methadone.
[16:23:21] <oliwe> yeah i dont know about that sort of stuff
[16:23:23] <oliwe> they are nice though
[16:23:29] <oliwe> not sure why its specificly iranian
[16:23:30] <oliwe> s
[16:23:45] <oliwe> same with restaurants and cafés, most are owned by syrians
[16:23:51] <beancurd> they have a decent education system, and pay people in the science field well.
[16:24:36] <oliwe> thats nice
[16:24:46] <oliwe> over here you cant get into medical school unless you want to help people
[16:24:52] <oliwe> liek you cant get in if you are in for the money
[16:25:40] <beancurd> sounds like a good way to do things.
[16:26:25] <b-lew> Is this the right way to go about having the same height on a sidebar?
[16:26:25] <b-lew> $(".search-listing-main").height(Math.max($(".search-listing-main").height(), $(".content-wrapper").height()));
[16:30:04] <bambu> Hey!
[16:30:40] <bambu> My code works as I want it to, however if someone clicks a link for this: bambuseae.org/about  the server attempts (as it should) to find the file about
[16:31:07] <bambu> I'm using history.js and such, so I'm not sure if I should just use bambuseae.org/#about or what
[16:31:27] <bambu> I like the cleanliness of bambuseae.org/about over /#about though ;p
[16:31:37] <bambu> So just use #about?
[16:40:32] <bambu> So my issue is someone clicking a link for http://bambuseae.org/test, also the back button isn't working
[16:40:41] <bambu> I'll need to look a bit more, but if anyone has any ideas
[16:48:23] <osirisx11> hi all
[16:48:39] <osirisx11> can anyone please suggest another library besides http://pagescroller.com/ that is free?
[16:59:09] <phiz> how can i make a $.get() use a GET variable I have already, for example if i go to http://domain.com/?test, how could i pass test to the $.get() ?
[17:00:30] <phiz> i can get what i want with var param = window.location.search;
[17:03:27] <phiz> i guess how do i pass the value of that variable in a $.get()
[17:17:11] <phiz> seems like this is extremely easy i am just trying to over complicate it
[17:19:05] <defaultro> when you're coding guys, do you use spaces or tabs?
[17:19:16] <defaultro> which is diff friendly?
[17:22:13] <tw2113> tabs or you're wrong
[17:24:11] <phiz> i am trying to take a GET variable i already have, like if i go to http://domain.com/?test and pass test in a $.get('test.php', {test: 'whatever'} ...);
[17:24:25] <phiz> i think i am going down the wrong path though because it is way too much code
[17:24:33] <defaultro> tw2113, so tab is better?
[17:25:04] <tw2113> in my world, yes
[17:25:26] <defaultro> what editor are you using?
[17:31:42] <tw2113> sublime text
[18:06:40] <b-lew1> Can I grab some help on this post? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14410005/responsive-grid-2-columns-need-to-be-the-same-height
[18:06:47] <b-lew1> Almost there but not quite and I"m kind of lost.
[18:17:35] <Afflicto> I want to edit the text of an element but not the child elements. Is that possible?
[18:20:21] <amatecha> heh
[18:20:34] <amatecha> create a span inside that element to target?
[18:31:32] <samholmes> Why is $.each's callback's argument list reversed in order from $.grep or $.map?
[18:40:25] <cornfeedhobo> hello, I am curious if there is already an easy approach to this.... I would like to have a number of ad-containing iframes on a page. is there a way to put them in divs with specific sizes and only allow them to load once the page is drawn and ready?
[18:41:37] <cornfeedhobo> or rather, just leave the iframes as they are and only load their content once the page is drawn?
[18:48:59] <b-lew1> Can I score some help?
[18:59:10] <oksushi> yeah —i just got a second hard dual DVI to mini displayport adaptor
[18:59:13] <oksushi> gah
[18:59:17] <oksushi> wrong window :/
[19:18:25] <vrlogrs> hey guys
[19:18:31] <vrlogrs> might be an odd question ..
[19:18:58] <vrlogrs> but, is there a function that takes in a #div and automatically scales everything inside of it
[19:18:59] <vrlogrs> ?
[19:19:14] <Es0teric> has anyone used slidesJS here?
[19:19:32] <vrlogrs> like .. function x (div, perc) { } .. where everything in div is increased/decreased by perc
[19:20:22] <vrlogrs> does that make sense? :S
[19:21:57] <coldhead> no vrlogrs
[19:22:13] <coldhead> one would usually try to do that with percentages in their CSS
[19:22:26] <coldhead> then it's the browser's problem
[19:22:33] <vrlogrs> hmm
[19:23:07] <vrlogrs> ok, i guess ill just have to do it manually
[19:23:15] <vrlogrs> thanks anyways
[19:25:26] <Es0teric> has anyone used slidesJS here?
[19:59:52] <grafi> nope
[20:09:35] <fattest> hello all. can someone please put this in a html file http://jsfiddle.net/rniemeyer/NLGm8/
[20:11:12] <fattest> any1??
[20:14:12] <fattest> is any1 here
[20:14:39] <coldhead> i'm looking now, fatty
[20:14:42] <coldhead> simmer down
[20:14:51] <fattest> ok thx
[20:14:53] <coldhead> what's the problem
[20:15:15] <fattest> can you put it in a html?
[20:15:32] <coldhead> you want to extract the HTML without all the JS?
[20:15:42] <fattest> no
[20:15:48] <fattest> i want to put it all in a html
[20:15:49] <fattest> i dont know how
[20:16:49] <fattest> coldhead: do you know how
[20:17:12] <coldhead> like http://jsfiddle.net/NLGm8/63/ ?
[20:17:15] <popof_> the syntax for a child is ('#parentID childID') right?
[20:17:26] <popof_> or it two #'s
[20:17:37] <coldhead> each ID needs a #
[20:17:41] <coldhead> same as in CSS selectors
[20:17:44] <coldhead> #childID
[20:17:51] <tw2113> why is so much html markup wrapped in script tags fattest ?
[20:18:07] <coldhead> templates, bro
[20:18:07] <tw2113> the data-bind stuff?
[20:18:07] <fattest> tw2113: its not my code
[20:18:26] <tw2113> i had never seen it before, i didn't know :)
[20:18:54] <fattest> http://pastehtml.com/view/cpkfs0wxl.html
[20:18:56] <fattest> look at it^
[20:19:05] <fattest> i copied all the code and pasted it into the html, but it didn't work
[20:20:42] <fattest> tw2113: did u see
[20:21:16] <tw2113> well you don't have the jquery/jqueryui libraries loaded
[20:21:38] <fattest> tw2113: how do i load it
[20:24:07] <fattest> tw2113: do u know how?
[20:24:14] <tw2113> hold your horses
[20:24:32] <tw2113> <script src="URL HERE"></script>
[20:25:31] <tw2113> and yes, if you know what you're doing and how to do it, i don't see why the contents of that jsfiddle can't be in an html file
[20:40:15] <popof_> coldhead: can you do $'(#parent > .classname')? doesnt seem to work
[20:43:44] <tw2113> maybe if you had your quotes right
[20:43:49] <tw2113> popof_,
[20:44:09] <popof_> tw2113: heh no that was me just writing here
[20:44:17] <popof_> I have to use .children() I think
[20:44:26] <coldhead> > means immediate child
[20:44:40] <coldhead> so if you really have that class as an IMMEDIATE child of that ID it should work
[20:45:02] <coldhead> otherwise either your HTML is wrong or your selector is wrong or both
[20:45:02] <tw2113> no i think > selects any matching child
[20:45:12] <tw2113> + is immediate
[20:45:34] <coldhead> very possibly, i know nothing
[20:47:19] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/efewih/1/edit
[20:47:57] <b1lly> coldhead: I think > means first "level"
[20:47:58] <tw2113> something like that
[20:48:02] <b1lly> of a child
[20:48:12] <tw2113> BE KIND TO HIM IT'S HIS FIRST GOD DANG DAY
[20:48:25] <tw2113> he can't know everything in 24 hours straight with no coffee
[20:48:41] <coldhead> i thought + was something to do with siblings
[20:48:43] <coldhead> or adjacency
[20:48:49] <tw2113> that's like Bradley Manning treatment there
[20:50:33] <coldhead> An adjacent sibling combinator selector allows you to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
[20:50:39] <b1lly> could be wrong O_o
[20:50:40] <coldhead> so + is not children
[20:50:51] <coldhead> i think you're right, b1lly
[20:50:59] <coldhead> i think you and chris coyier know what's up
[20:51:11] <tw2113> the coyier knows css
[20:51:18] <coldhead> he loves it
[20:51:22] <coldhead> can't get enough
[20:51:27] <coldhead> positively hoggish for it
[20:52:16] <b1lly> looking at apartments is tough
[20:53:03] <coldhead> yes i wouldn't do it
[20:53:45] <b1lly> sux
[20:56:11] <raj> I want to make sure there is more than 1 item if sortable is able to drag the item
[20:56:18] <raj> how can I do that?
[20:56:33] <b1lly> huh
[20:57:17] <raj> put a conditional and return function in 'start' event?
[20:57:24] <b1lly> what
[20:57:25] <coldhead> No entiendo.
[20:57:32] <b1lly> please clarify what your trying to do
[20:57:52] <b1lly> man I need a good open source project to beat up
[20:58:35] <tw2113> jqueryui
[21:13:22] <raj> why doesn't sortable have an event before 'start'?
[21:13:29] <raj> so I can stop it before it makes any changes to the dom?
[21:14:44] <b1lly> ...
[21:14:57] <raj> I want to stop it in its tracks
[21:15:01] <raj> or be able to
[21:15:05] <raj> if there's only 1 of an item
[21:15:20] <raj> I don't want the item to be able to be moved at all
[21:15:29] <raj> it is currently able to move a few pixels
[21:17:53] <b1lly> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-disabled
[21:17:53] <coldhead> is this something relevant to your interests raj http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10760861/jquery-sortable-disable-single-item ?
[21:21:14] <b1lly> brb
[21:21:28] <raj> thanks coldhead
[21:21:31] <raj> but I don't see how that works
[21:25:55] <raj> well, basically, I don't ahve an ajax call
[21:38:29] <seydar> is there a way to do an HTTP GET without Ajax?
[21:38:43] <seydar> Ajax appears to be suffering from the whole "you can't do cross-domain requests" thing
[21:38:55] <b1lly> nope
[21:39:05] <b1lly> well yes, technically
[21:39:15] <b1lly> but if your trying to do it dynamically after the page loaded, no
[21:39:23] <b1lly> requires ajax
[21:39:28] <seydar> how do you recommend i weasel my way out of the cross-domain issue?
[21:39:58] <grafi> its there for a reason ...
[21:40:00] <seydar> here's my ultimate goal: i want to load a page and then modify the DOM
[21:40:00] <grafi> ;)
[21:40:28] <b1lly> http://usejquery.com/posts/the-jquery-cross-domain-ajax-guide
[21:41:13] <seydar> b1lly: i've seen the JSONP mentioned quite a few times now, but it seems to be only good for getting JSON data
[21:41:23] <seydar> could i use it to get, say, http://wikipedia.org?
[21:41:46] <tw2113> if wikipedia has json endpoints
[21:41:54] <tw2113> read the 2nd heading of that link seydar
[21:43:09] <seydar> i wish there were an equivalent of sudo for my browser
[21:43:14] <seydar> so i could just be like "motherfucking do it"
[21:43:43] <b1lly> yeah, that would be a huge security risk
[21:44:02] <seydar> could i do it anyways?
[21:44:16] <tw2113> does the word "no" say anything?
[21:44:21] <fattest> Hi
[21:44:27] <seydar> no
[21:44:42] <fattest> Does any1 know any simple mouse over popup from jsfiddle?
[21:44:43] <seydar> i understand it's insecure, but i'm only looking to use it for a quick demo
[21:47:10] <tw2113> i'm pretty certain it's built into the browsers
[21:47:33] <grafi> so roll your own browser and you are good to go^^
[22:01:35] <greg5green> seydar, can you just set up a proxy?
[22:01:44] <greg5green> curl has no problem doing a x-domain
[22:10:06] <seydar> greg5green: yeah, i was about to set up a proxxy
[22:10:13] <seydar> but i've decided to just make a chrome extension
[22:10:43] <evanx> I'm using a date picker and trying to set the startDate to '+1d', but is not working, I don't know what I'm doing wrong, can somebody help me?
[22:10:52] <seydar> i had been trying to do the proxy as an extra html page with JS in the <head> instead of <?php>, but that was a no go (obviously)
[22:11:01] <seydar> well, not obviously to me, but it is now
[22:11:56] <wookiehangover> seydar: fwiw node proxy servers are stupid easy
[22:39:24] <Afflicto> Using .trigger('event'), can I pass in parameters to the event handler?
[22:40:29] <Afflicto> Yes I can, I figured it out, had to use the second argument for the handler xP
[22:46:13] <vrlogrs> hey guys
[22:46:27] <vrlogrs> how can i animate 2 divs things together ?
[22:47:42] <vrlogrs> like, synchronously
[22:47:54] <vrlogrs> for example, i want 1 div to grow, while the other shrinks
[22:48:10] <wookiehangover> vrlogrs: do it with css
[22:48:30] <vrlogrs> i want to use .animate()
[22:48:31] <wookiehangover> add a class to the parent element
[22:49:00] <wookiehangover> http://gif.ly/d984b621.gif
[22:49:36] <vrlogrs> i dont understand how i can do it with just css :S
[22:50:03] <vrlogrs> is there no way to do it with jquery, synchronously ?
[22:50:15] <wookiehangover> sure there is
[22:50:29] <wookiehangover> but doing with css is better
[22:50:35] <wookiehangover> and you still get to use jquery
[22:51:05] <vrlogrs> i dont know how that would work ..
[22:51:07] <wookiehangover> so then you just style the two things differently, and use transitions to achieve the animations
[22:51:18] <wookiehangover> http://css3please.com/
[22:51:24] <vrlogrs> that would be too many transitions?
[23:01:32] <wookiehangover> vrlogrs: http://jsfiddle.net/8cT8H/2/
[23:02:33] <vrlogrs> fascinating ..
[23:02:36] <vrlogrs> thanks wookiehangover
[23:03:43] <wookiehangover> vrlogrs: I got the css3 stuff from http://css3please.com/
[23:04:39] <wookiehangover> cause typing -webkit, -moz is for chumps and chumpettes
[23:04:39] <vrlogrs> not really sure how this is working though ..
[23:04:49] <wookiehangover> look at the css
[23:05:54] <wookiehangover> when the body tag has the class 'holy-shit', .mything sets its width to 90px and .my-other-thing sets its width to 300px
[23:06:13] <wookiehangover> and then when the class is removed, they go back to their original state
[23:06:31] <vrlogrs> oh .. i see
[23:06:40] <wookiehangover> the transition "all 0.6s ease-out" is what makes it animate
[23:06:44] <vrlogrs> very nice
[23:06:51] <vrlogrs> ill use it :) thanks
[23:07:18] <wookiehangover> "all" is specifying the property to animate (everything, in this case)
[23:07:28] <wookiehangover> 0.6s is the time in seconds
[23:07:45] <wookiehangover> and "ease-out" tells it which easing function to use
[23:07:58] <wookiehangover> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/
[23:08:00] <vrlogrs> i like it :)
[23:08:08] <wookiehangover> boom and now you know about css3 transitions
[23:09:00] <vrlogrs> :)
[23:09:16] <seydar> so i got an HTMLElement from event.target
[23:09:33] <seydar> i've gathered that this is different from a JQuery element, because i'd like to modify its CSS
[23:09:56] <seydar> event.target.css('border', '2px solid red') doesn't work. what can i do to make it work?
[23:10:24] <wookiehangover> seydar: because that's just a DOM node, not a jQuery object
[23:10:44] <seydar> wookiehangover: how do i make it a jQuery object?
[23:10:46] <wookiehangover> in order to use jQuery stuff with it, you need to do $(event.target)
[23:11:17] <seydar> ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
[23:11:22] <wookiehangover> and fwiw currentTarget is usually what you want...
[23:11:26] <seydar> i am enlightened
[23:11:39] <seydar> i was getting event.target from a mouseup event
[23:12:12] <wookiehangover> http://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/
[23:12:23] <wookiehangover> http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[23:12:34] <wookiehangover> there's a non-trivial difference between the two
[23:12:53] <seydar> reading now, thank you
[23:13:33] <seydar> so i guess i'm not grasping the difference
[23:13:44] <seydar> does $(event.target) == event.currentTarget?
[23:14:42] <wookiehangover> no they can be different
[23:15:34] <wookiehangover> in the second example on the event.target docs
[23:16:05] <wookiehangover> if you click on item 1 and then click on a sub item, the click doesn't register
[23:16:28] <wookiehangover> because the click is coming from a child element
[23:17:21] <seydar> and if it were currentTarget, then it would still hide?
[23:17:24] <wookiehangover> so, when you bind an event on an element and it has child elements, event.target *might* not be the element you're looking for
[23:17:43] <seydar> hm
[23:17:55] <seydar> that IS a nontrivial different
[23:18:03] <wookiehangover> yes, because current target is a reference to the element that the event is "attached" to
[23:18:44] <seydar> i think event.target is what i'm looking for
[23:18:52] <wookiehangover> word
[23:18:56] <seydar> since if i click on a subchild of a list, i want the subchild to be marked
[23:20:02] <seydar> also because currentTarget simply doesn't work
[23:21:36] <vrlogrs> wookiehangover: is there a way i can check before i toggle, whether or not the class has been set?
[23:22:04] <wookiehangover> yes
[23:22:20] <vrlogrs> because className will return all classes
[23:22:26] <wookiehangover> ?hasClass
[23:22:27] <bot-t> .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[23:22:28] <molavy> what this error mean
[23:22:28] <molavy> http://dpaste.com/883721/
[23:22:30] <molavy> ?
[23:22:41] <vrlogrs> wow - ur a genious -- thanks wookiehangover
[23:23:17] <wookiehangover> ♡
[23:24:02] <molavy> no idea?
[23:24:25] <wookiehangover> molavy: yr json is invalid
[23:24:33] <wookiehangover> http://jsonlint.com/
[23:27:01] <seydar> asldkjflkasjdf i'm calling toggle supplied with two functions to change the border, but it keeps hiding the elements i click
[23:31:48] <wookiehangover> seydar: are you using chrome/firefox devtools? if you're not, watch the ever popular paul_irish splain em to you http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOEw9iiopwI
[23:32:37] <seydar> wookiehangover: i am using chrome with the lil devtool thing that appears at the bottom of the window
[23:33:09] <wookiehangover> so inspect the elements and figure out what going on
[23:33:45] <wookiehangover> it's in the realm of solvable problems
[23:34:26] <seydar> hooray!
[23:34:51] <wookiehangover> http://gif.ly/164290ba.gif
[23:35:46] <seydar> i guess i can't use toggle to toggle css
[23:35:56] <seydar> even though everything on the internet says i can
[23:37:39] <seydar> so what's the recommended way to toggle css?
[23:37:45] <seydar> e.g., the border
[23:39:12] <seydar> looks like i'm stuck with toggleClass
[23:39:33] <grafi> and whats wrong with that?
[23:40:20] <seydar> well... nothing
[23:40:39] <seydar> i was just confused because a thousand resources online had examples using toggle()
[23:40:52] <seydar> i guess there was an API change
[23:42:14] <grafi> could be
