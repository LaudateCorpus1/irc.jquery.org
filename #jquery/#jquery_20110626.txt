[00:01:01] <coldhead> no dice?
[00:01:04] <jessicaf> doesnt work
[00:01:08] <coldhead> what is the URL you are visiting?
[00:01:14] <jessicaf> php.php
[00:01:14] <shaggy_> jessicaf: whats up?
[00:01:32] <coldhead> it's not file:///php.php is it/
[00:01:43] <jessicaf> yes
[00:01:48] <coldhead> ah
[00:01:53] <ltackett> that'll do it...
[00:01:55] <coldhead> that won't work
[00:02:06] <coldhead> you need to use localhost or someserver.com
[00:02:07] <jessicaf> why not
[00:02:15] <jessicaf> i am using localhost
[00:02:17] <coldhead> to get it to run the PHP code
[00:02:21] <jessicaf> i am sorry i didnt what you meant earlier
[00:02:25] <jessicaf> undertand
[00:02:27] <coldhead> ah okay
[00:03:00] <coldhead> so the URL is like http://localhost/php.php ?
[00:03:22] <dilvie> Hi.
[00:03:22] <coldhead> does that show "text" in your browser?
[00:03:32] <coldhead> HI DILVIE
[00:03:37] <jessicaf> no it does
[00:03:38] <coldhead> LET'S RUN AWAY TOGETHER
[00:03:40] <jessicaf> when it should
[00:03:49] <jessicaf> doesnt*
[00:04:09] <jessicaf> it does when i run the php.php directly
[00:04:19] <dilvie> coldhead: I would, but I'm afraid to leave my apartment. I live in the mission in SF. It's scary outside.
[00:04:33] <dilvie> sirens and gunshots!
[00:04:41] <coldhead> you have some awesome local music, dilvie
[00:04:45] <djQuery> dilvie: think of it as adventerous
[00:04:53] <coldhead> you should go out and enjoy it sometiems
[00:04:59] <dilvie> yeah.
[00:05:09] <dilvie> I live right above the trendiest club in the mission.
[00:05:13] <dilvie> I hear it all night long.
[00:05:18] <dilvie> every night of the week.
[00:05:20] <coldhead> i mean actual music
[00:05:21] <dilvie> =)
[00:05:22] <coldhead> not drum machines
[00:05:31] <dilvie> lol
[00:05:36] <dilvie> I like drum machines!
[00:05:47] <dilvie> TR 909!
[00:22:56] <Chibby_> i'm looking through the jqueryui site trying to find a page that explains all of the default classes (like ui-widget-content or ui-corner-all) and what they do
[00:23:00] <Chibby_> can anyone help me please? (:
[00:48:40] <coldhead> so i guess we'll never know what happened with jessicaf
[00:48:48] <coldhead> but always wonder
[00:52:22] <jessicaf> i am so fed up right now
[00:52:37] <jessicaf> this is the worst weekend ever
[00:52:59] <coldhead> aw don't say that, i'm sure there are worse still to come
[00:53:23] <coldhead> what's broken?
[00:54:27] <fotoflo> hello all. I am looking to sense a three finger tap/click event on multi-touch trackpads (and phones/tablets, but those are secondary) -- I'm looking at several solutions - jQtouch looks like it will do it, but jgestures.codeplex.com/ also looks like a viable (and simpler solution)  - - any suggestions?
[00:56:37] <coldhead> good grief
[01:23:48] <khaan> hi everybody. Does anyone knows of a good jquery background scrolling script?
[01:24:09] <khaan> ihave a 100% wide (but not high) div and i need to have some usual fade carousel
[01:58:51] <cybertronxy> hi
[02:02:25] <coldhead> hi
[02:03:08] <fotoflo> anyone here?
[02:03:21] <coldhead> oh god i'm so alone
[02:03:43] <fotoflo> cold head I'm here to comfort you, darling!
[02:04:03] <coldhead> thx babe
[02:05:17] <fotoflo> any idea how to sense a 3finger tap event (the shocker!) ?
[02:08:25] <coldhead> i doubt there's anything better than whatever jQtouch has
[02:08:43] <coldhead> its going to be pretty OS and hardware dependent
[02:22:13] <fotoflo> coldhead jQtouch documentation seemsâ€¦. limited (to say the least)
[02:26:18] <MoTiOnXml> i guess jQuery.live() is just a kick ass API
[02:26:21] <MoTiOnXml> \o/
[03:09:15] <Chib> sorry for repeating a question i asked earlier (i had to leave work), but i was wondering if there is a page on the jqueryui site that explains all the classes and such that are a part of jqueryui - such as ui-widget-content
[03:10:14] <Chib> oh
[03:10:15] <Chib> i found it
[03:10:17] <Chib> heh, thanks!
[03:29:56] <niftylettuce> combine string with itself x times in JS?
[03:32:42] <Chib> so if x was 3 and your string was "ab" you'd get "ababab"?
[04:08:53] <depex> Creating some tabed content, much like this http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors#predictions
[04:09:05] <depex> Any plugins or techniques I should be aware of before I start?
[04:10:52] <Chib> well there's the standard jqueryui ones
[04:10:53] <Chib> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[04:12:20] <depex> Looks good. Guess I wont find anything that support #anchor using multiple levels of tabs tough
[04:13:49] <depex> supported
[04:13:51] <depex> great thanks
[04:38:50] <FuzzyNuts> Is this correct jQuery?
[04:38:51] <FuzzyNuts> http://pastebin.com/xRb1GzrS
[04:42:13] <osfameron> FuzzyNuts: what do you mean?
[04:42:31] <osfameron> javascript will throw an error if it's invalid syntax
[04:42:38] <osfameron> is it giving you the results you wanted?
[04:48:15] <innociv> Has anyone used http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/ ?
[04:48:29] <dr0id> no, no-one
[04:48:47] <innociv> Lol
[04:52:28] <FuzzyNuts> osfameron: I don't mean errors exactly, but just need help on figuring out as to why it doesn't  work
[04:52:57] <osfameron> FuzzyNuts: in what way doesn't it work?
[04:53:34] <FuzzyNuts> It just doesn't do anything
[04:53:46] <osfameron> ok
[04:53:48] <FuzzyNuts> The mouseover doesn't change colour at all
[04:53:51] <osfameron> were you *expecting* it do do something?
[04:54:29] <FuzzyNuts> Yes
[04:54:53] <osfameron> what, exactly?
[04:55:54] <osfameron> FuzzyNuts: you didn't, for example, past which html you are expecting to trigger it
[04:55:58] <Chib> FuzzyNuts: you can't animate background-color
[04:56:05] <FuzzyNuts> I was expecting the background color of the link to fade into the blue (black in the code I posted)
[04:56:15] <osfameron> li.a would be <li class="a">
[04:56:25] <FuzzyNuts> Dammit
[04:56:37] <FuzzyNuts> What would a link in an <li> tag be?
[04:56:49] <osfameron> 'li a' ?
[04:56:55] <FuzzyNuts> Ah right
[04:57:18] <FuzzyNuts> I tried defining this with a .link in a div around each hyperlink, but that didn't work
[04:57:28] <osfameron> Chib: ah, that's odd.  I'm sure I've used animated background colours (fading in and out of yellow)
[04:57:31] <FuzzyNuts> I'm not ignoring what you said, Chib
[04:58:00] <Chib> osfameron: you were possibly using jqueryui or something else where you can do that
[04:58:07] <osfameron> Chib: ah, that could be it
[04:58:10] <FuzzyNuts> Ah right
[04:58:33] <osfameron> there are 2 questions at least - is the event firing?  and does the event work?
[04:59:17] <FuzzyNuts> I'll try adding a hello world message box and see if that is called
[04:59:26] <Chib> http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[04:59:45] <Chib> i'm not expert, you might be able to do it with jquery too, but i doubt it
[04:59:58] <osfameron> yeah, that rings a bell
[05:00:15] <osfameron> i.e. that core jq couldn't do it, but it's extended in jqui
[05:00:24] <FuzzyNuts> yes, that works
[05:00:37] <FuzzyNuts> Ok, I'll try jQueryUI
[05:00:45] <FuzzyNuts> Also, by that works, I meant the alert
[05:02:09] <FuzzyNuts> How do I set up the jQueryUI package?
[05:02:17] <FuzzyNuts> Do I need to keep all the css etc?
[05:05:39] <innociv> Is there an ajax deep linker that supports multiple #'s?  It looks like this one can only reload one ajax..
[05:06:53] <Chib> FuzzyNuts: skim through http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started
[05:08:12] <FuzzyNuts> Thanks Chib
[05:08:26] <FuzzyNuts> I'll give y'all an update when I'm done
[05:11:58] <FuzzyNuts> Do I have to use the theme provided when installing jQueryUI?
[05:18:17] <Chib> you can use any of the themes or customise them
[05:18:25] <Chib> that's covered in the link i sent
[05:19:49] <Jakey> yo yo
[05:20:07] <Jakey> how do you make a dropdownlist selection using jquery
[05:20:36] <Jakey> like i want to make a dropdownlist select a selection in a dropdown list
[05:23:38] <innociv> .change() and log the event
[05:26:30] <FuzzyNuts> Chib, I meant can I just leave the .css file out and use what I already have?
[05:28:29] <innociv> This api for asual's deep linking is so closed and bad ;(  I'll try jquery bbq
[05:31:47] <took> hello. Got a little problem with my jquery-ajax request: there is a ajax-link to add/delete entrys.  on click it adds/deletes the entry and the function returns the new link to delete/add the entry. So if you klick "+", a "-" occures. so far so good.
[05:32:05] <Chib> if you're just using the animate plugin, look in that link and it tells you down the bottom what it requires
[05:32:22] <took> but the new link does not work anymore. html looks finde but it seems like there is no event attached to the link anymore
[05:32:33] <took> the link looks like (without the <td>...):
[05:32:41] <Chib> oh.. it's broken
[05:32:42] <Chib> wtf
[05:32:42] <took> <td><a id="yt1" href="#">-</a></td>
[05:32:51] <took> the jquery looks like:
[05:32:58] <took> jQuery('body').undelegate('#yt1','click').delegate('#yt1','click',function(){jQuery.ajax({'url':'/index.php?r=clienten/setAnfrage&id_berater=1&id_client=4&ajax=clienten-form&set=delete','cache':false,'success':function(html){jQuery("#yt1").replaceWith(html)}});return false;});
[05:33:12] <took> what am I doing wrong?
[05:33:18] <Chib> pretty sure it doesn't need the css, test it!
[05:33:31] <innociv> took, are you removing and replacing the link?
[05:33:48] <innociv> Yes, yes you are.
[05:34:06] <took> replaceWith(html) ... I guess
[05:34:08] <innociv> That's why.  You're replacing $yt1 so events on it are removed.
[05:34:12] <innociv> #yt1*
[05:35:25] <took> yeah I need to alter the LinkBody (+ to - or vice versa) and one param in the request (set=add to set=delete or vice versa)
[05:36:12] <took> what else can I do instead of replacing the whole link? should I just update those to properties to make te event stay linked to the element?
[05:36:49] <took> or is there a way the crate a new event for th enew link?
[05:37:05] <took> s/the crate/to create
[05:46:01] <ElGoorf> im using jquery ui datepicker, i want to change the class used for the left/right buttons, default is class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-triangle-w"
[05:46:07] <ElGoorf> how/where do i change this?
[05:46:23] <dagon666> is there a way to determine whetver toggleClass added a class or removed it ?
[05:48:54] <FuzzyNuts> Ok
[05:48:58] <FuzzyNuts> erm
[05:49:00] <FuzzyNuts> Chib
[05:49:09] <FuzzyNuts> http://pastebin.com/fAnWaGhR This is the code I've got now
[05:52:51] <Chib> you probably have to use the formats for colour that it tells you on the animate page
[05:58:45] <FuzzyNuts> Chib, I'll try that
[05:59:00] <FuzzyNuts> What about the slideDown though?
[06:01:31] <Chib> looks fine i guess?
[06:07:36] <FuzzyNuts> Chib, the slideDown doesn't work :/
[06:07:48] <FuzzyNuts> I really don't understand why
[06:07:57] <FuzzyNuts> Maybe something to do with the files?
[06:08:00] <nicholas\\> I got a problem when trying to assign the response from a ajax request to a variable. It returns empty, but when i alert() the response the correct info is shown? http://pastebin.com/YzedxYt3
[06:08:41] <Chib> FuzzyNuts: paste your code in jsfiddle.net
[06:09:13] <FuzzyNuts> Ok
[06:09:30] <xover> took: Not sure I'm understanding your code / scenario correctly, but it might help to recall that both .live and .delegate work by attaching a handler to a containing element (like <table>) that calls the function when an event from a contained element (like <td>) bubbles up the tree.
[06:11:03] <xover> took: The selector you pass to .live()/.delegate() matches against any current or future elements, so unless you delete the _containing_ element (e.g. a <table>) you should never need to re-add the handler.
[06:11:28] <took> yeah, looks like there IS an event attached to the new link - but the target-value is still the old one. the url in js does not changes, just the link-body in html...
[06:12:58] <xover> Stuff your URLs in a variable, and add another var to keep toggle state, so you don't need to change the function (just the variables it uses), perhaps?
[06:13:06] <took> <a id="yt1" href="#">-</a> becomes <a id="yt1" href="#">+</a> but the url does not change from &set=delete to &set=add... since there is not code yet to to that ;)
[06:13:57] <took> s/to to/to do
[06:14:48] <xover> Also, you might want to check that you don't have duplicate ID values in there. The results will be... unpredictable, but probably broken.
[06:16:14] <timing> hi!
[06:16:20] <timing> the target atribute of a form
[06:16:25] <timing> is that a prop() or an attr()?
[06:16:32] <timing> or is there a list for this?
[06:17:15] <FuzzyNuts> Chib, doesn't work
[06:17:26] <FuzzyNuts> http://jsfiddle.net/wvaP7/4/
[06:18:58] <took> id_values are unique. How about rendering both links from the beginning and hide the one thats not used atm?
[06:19:46] <xover> took: That might work, but isn't the most elegant of solutions (duplicate markup) and then you really need to watch out for duplicate IDs.
[06:19:50] <FuzzyNuts> took: talking to timing?
[06:20:37] <took> FuzzyNuts: timing? no :-?
[06:20:55] <nielsb> hey all. I am trying to animate images from left to right. When done, they should be animated from right to left about 100 pixels lower
[06:20:57] <FuzzyNuts> Ok
[06:21:13] <FuzzyNuts> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[06:21:18] <nielsb> my code so far: http://pastebin.com/EHSpBnfC. I can't understand how to make something animate twice. it won't do aFunction() again
[06:21:20] <xover> timing: .attr() gets you the string value of the attribute in markup, but .prop() gets you the DOM property. For the target of a form this should be the same thing unless you've modified it in JS.
[06:22:30] <nielsb> FuzzyNuts: I got the images moving from left to right with that code :)
[06:22:39] <FuzzyNuts> ok
[06:22:54] <xover> timing: The API reference uses the example of the "checked" attribute: .attr() would give you the string "checked" while .prop() knows that the attribute is a boolean and so gives you the boolean "true".
[06:23:57] <timing> xover: great, thanks!
[06:24:41] <xover> timing: Incidentally, http://api.jquery.com/ does pretty well at answering questions like these.
[06:25:17] <timing> ofcourse :-)
[06:25:40] <timing> it's hot here :-)
[06:28:22] <nielsb> anyone any idea why this function isn't repeating itself? http://pastebin.com/EHSpBnfC
[06:28:53] <Jayflux> why don't you put it into jsfiddle.net nielsb so we can see it run
[06:29:04] <nielsb> good idea :)
[06:29:19] <Chib> FuzzyNuts: the formatting of yours numbers was still wrong
[06:29:26] <Chib> and your code was missing a function()
[06:29:45] <Chib> http://jsfiddle.net/msafB/
[06:29:49] <Chib> i fixed it, that should work
[06:30:14] <Chib> err remove the alerts
[06:32:10] <Efazati> how i can use selector in new data i loaded with ajax?
[06:32:16] <Chib> i wish jsfiddle would let you include jqueryui framework too
[06:32:36] <Efazati> i have #x in ajax data and i want some thing like this $("#x").val()
[06:33:15] <FuzzyNuts> Yeah thanks Chib
[06:33:22] <FuzzyNuts> You're a great help ;)
[06:34:11] <nielsb> Jayflux: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/K7khT/?
[06:35:26] <Jayflux> so whats this meant to do
[06:38:40] <Mrfloyd> how can i can i get a variable from the get params
[06:38:40] <Mrfloyd> ?
[06:39:19] <Jayflux> nielsb has this fixed it
[06:39:20] <Jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/K7khT/1/
[06:39:48] <Chib> lol
[06:39:55] <Chib> i like how you just totally guess at what he wants d:
[06:40:10] <Jayflux> me Chib ?
[06:40:18] <Chib> yeah d:
[06:40:18] <lulzplzkthx> Can anyone explain why this doesn't work as expected: if($('ul#dock li#'+winID).length){ return; }
[06:40:24] <Jayflux> haha worked though right?
[06:40:28] <lulzplzkthx> And this does: if($('ul#dock li[id='+winID+']').length){ return; }
[06:40:30] <Chib> i dunno lol!
[06:40:34] <Chib> they moved off the right
[06:40:35] <Chib> heh
[06:40:37] <lulzplzkthx> Are they not essentially the same thing?
[06:40:39] <Jayflux> yeah I think thats what he wants
[06:40:50] <nielsb> Jayflux: yes, but now it should repeat itself
[06:41:04] <nielsb> I already had that moving to the right
[06:41:06] <nielsb> :)
[06:41:06] <Jayflux> it is
[06:41:10] <Jayflux> the function is repeating
[06:41:21] <nielsb> o-o
[06:41:23] <nielsb> not for me?
[06:41:59] <nielsb> it just moves them ro the right once
[06:42:01] <Chib> what are you expecting it to do?
[06:42:35] <nielsb> well, what I finally want
[06:42:46] <nielsb> is the images moving right. once done, they move left again
[06:44:03] <FuzzyNuts> Chib, just added a stop function to the mouseover so the animation gets reset if it's still in progress. Think you could tell me how to make it so the whole width gets filled up, not just where the text is?
[06:46:50] <Efazati> how can use selector for loaded data with ajax(get)
[06:47:03] <Chib> have the hover on the div instead and make the div width 100%
[06:48:32] <FuzzyNuts> ok
[06:48:44] <xover> lulzplzkthx: Those should be interchangeable, yes (you're missing mandatory quotes on the second one though). Perhaps check the value of winID to see if there's something there that might affect it?
[06:49:41] <nielsb> Chib: any idea?
[06:50:13] <lulzplzkthx> Yes, I believe I figured it out. It was a friends project and he said it was a random 6 char string. My guess is it started with a 0-9 when he tested the '#'+winID, and an A-z when he tried the other way.
[06:50:17] <lulzplzkthx> Thanks xover :)
[06:56:00] <Efazati> how can find first key in dictionary?
[06:56:56] <FuzzyNuts> Chib, nothing happens with the div
[06:57:32] <nielsb> Chib, how comes the div's don't move anymore?
[06:57:35] <nielsb> you repeat the function right?
[07:08:46] <innociv> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-jquery-ui-tabs/#some_tabs=2&more_tabs=1 How would I use this only to handle the hash event on back button and window load, instead of change?  I don't want what I put in the function firing when a hash is added after load.
[07:11:38] <Efazati> madaretono gaidam javabam nemidid adam mire hame ro search mikone
[07:11:48] <nielsb> anyone knows how to repeat my function? http://jsfiddle.net/K7khT/1/ it still doesn't play the animation infinite
[07:17:43] <greg_f> I have form with two buttons, each button has own url to action, how to send form to different urls?\
[07:24:48] <nielsb> no one knows how to repeat a function? >>
[07:25:15] <innociv> ... I just made an infinite loop and have no idea how.
[07:25:23] <innociv> repeat a function?
[07:25:27] <nielsb> :p that's what I want lol
[07:25:32] <nielsb> yes repeat it indefinilty

[07:25:46] <nielsb> like*
[07:25:49] <nielsb> yes but it does not work :(
[07:25:55] <nielsb> it should keep repeating itself right?
[07:26:12] <mike_c> I've got a quick question. I'm adding new divs to a page using normal javascript (document.createElement etc). how do i get jquery to apply the draggable/ resizable flags to them?
[07:26:21] <innociv> delay is not defined
[07:26:24] <mike_c> p.s. I'm trying to do everything in an external file
[07:26:36] <innociv> Look at errors.
[07:26:37] <mike_c> which is loaded after jquery and query ui
[07:26:58] <innociv> mike_c, use a jquery selector to select what you just added?
[07:27:05] <mike_c> I tried
[07:27:39] <mike_c> I keep thinking that it might be the fact that i'm using an external js, but when I try other stuff using $() in a function, it works
[07:28:24] <nicholas\\> Ive got a list of items and when clicking on them they opens a new tab. What is the best way to store the tabs so that when i refresh the page the tabs wont close?
[07:28:45] <nicholas\\> I assume some sort of cookie, but is there a function in jquery for this?
[07:28:57] <nielsb> innociv: how comes delay is not defined ? :s
[07:29:12] <innociv> You haven't created the function
[07:30:23] <nielsb> hm, so what should I do?
[07:32:41] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/K7khT/11/ Not spelling setInterval wrong helps, too.  Look at your error log.
[07:48:35] <nielsb> innociv: thanks, but now you just safe it in var repeat right? No actual repeating is done?
[07:48:52] <innociv> It is repeating
[07:49:00] <innociv> it's just setting it to left 800 every time, obviously
[07:49:17] <nielsb> aaaah
[07:49:19] <nielsb> :D
[07:49:23] <nielsb> now I get it lol
[07:50:33] <nielsb> innociv: so how would I get them to move in the opposite direction now?
[07:51:07] <innociv> By setting the proper values you want
[07:51:18] <innociv> get the currrent ones and add to them?
[07:53:19] <nielsb> uhm
[07:53:24] <nielsb> well now they move left to right
[07:53:28] <nielsb> and when they are done with that
[07:53:31] <nielsb> they should move right to left
[07:55:55] <innociv> I can't help anymore
[07:59:48] <dannN> Hi. why does is bg animation does not work? http://nopaste.info/8e52aa6c11.html
[08:00:30] <dannN> does i need to include jquery-ui for animate() ?
[08:02:17] <dannN> the mouseover works, but it doesn't apply the color to the item
[08:02:41] <skylamer`> give more specific selector
[08:03:31] <dannN> what have i to do?
[08:06:29] <skylamer`> and may be u have to specify how many ms to be the animation
[08:07:17] <dannN> i  have already added the ms to the animation
[08:07:26] <dannN> in firebug ir shows the animation but the color does not append
[08:08:37] <skylamer`> so add css
[08:09:27] <dannN> but i want the fadein of the color
[08:10:52] <dannyzb> I'm trying to have an element appear instead of another -> one slides out and one slides in instead of it
[08:11:18] <dannyzb> problem is , when one of the elements slides in it starts in a position directly below the element that just slid out
[08:11:36] <dannyzb> then immediately drops into the correct position .. how can I prevent that?
[08:13:10] <dannyzb> http://pastebin.com/nUjMLwuL
[08:15:32] <Woet> dannyzb: so there is a time where both of them are visible?
[08:15:37] <Woet> one sliding in and one sliding out?
[08:15:44] <Woet> or is it okay if one slides out, then another one slides in
[08:16:04] <dannyzb> isn't supposed to be .. look at the code .. I slide in after the first has finished sliding out
[08:16:42] <dannyzb> I think this may be a jQuery bug as this only happens with one of the elements -> and both of them are statically positioned
[08:28:06] <lazyPower> Is it possible to change the visibility of a cloned object while it is detached from the dom? if so, copiedObject.toggle(); is not working as i intend it to.. or not at all.
[08:33:47] <Spire> Hello everyone!  I was on the verge of submitting a jQuery bug report when it told me I should come here and ask first.  :)
[08:34:10] <svenlito> lazyPower: display attribute instead and then attach it
[08:34:24] <muzone> Hey!
[08:34:24] <svenlito> id set *
[08:34:28] <muzone> Anybody good with Superfish?
[08:34:31] <Spire> Anyone up for helping me identify if my problem is jQuery or some weirdness on my part?  It's related to ajax.
[08:34:33] <FuzzyNuts> Hmm
[08:34:50] <lazyPower> svenlito: on the cloned object, use the .attr('display','visible');?
[08:34:58] <FuzzyNuts> How can I animate some text to move from the far right to the far left?
[08:35:17] <svenlito> lazyPower: css('display','block')
[08:36:20] <Spire> Basically, I'm doing an ajax POST and getting data back, but in the succes: fucntion(msg) the msg is populated with the source html of the page!  I have no idea why.
[08:36:48] <Spire> I'm not sending the source to the ajax php, so I don't know how it's sending it back.
[08:37:24] <lazyPower> svenlito: thanks
[08:37:36] <muzone> *AAAAAAAAAAAIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN* !!!
[08:37:53] <muzone> Which is better for JQUERY DROPDOWN MENUS - http://www.queness.com/post/1047/easy-to-style-jquery-drop-down-menu-tutorial or the Superfish plugin?
[08:38:33] <Spire> Any ideas, anyone?
[08:38:49] <Spire> I have a repro case if anyone wants to see it
[08:38:53] <muzone> *AAAAAAAAAAAIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN* !!!
[08:38:54] <muzone> *AAAAAAAAAAAIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN* !!!
[08:38:54] <muzone> *AAAAAAAAAAAIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN* !!!
[08:39:07] <Spire> Also I've tested it in Firefox and IE and they both have the same problem.
[08:39:19] <lazyPower> Spire: the response will read whatever is given. if its a 500 error page, it will contain that, if its a 200ok response with JSON data, it will copy that... so the url you're posting it to, has html.
[08:39:39] <lazyPower> Spire: if you dont want html, give the webmethod (or associated service, etc.) a different response output.
[08:40:27] <Spire> Well, the URL I'm posting to is "ajax_login.php" which has no html, it's just a php script that returns success or failure JSON data.  The source that I'm actually getting in msg is the source of the page that is *sending* the ajax.
[08:40:47] <lazyPower> interesting... show us some source
[08:41:04] <FuzzyNuts> Guys, how can I make a div tag move from the far right to the far left?
[08:41:06] <Spire> Okay, I'll try to figure out this jsfiddle thing so you guys can see it
[08:41:26] <Spire> Unless there's a better way to share source
[08:41:33] <svenlito> FuzzyNuts: look at .animate
[08:41:36] <lazyPower> i'm fine with gist, pastebin, etc.
[08:41:41] <Spire> ok
[08:41:54] <FuzzyNuts> sven, ok
[08:43:55] <Spire> Ok here is both login.php and ajax_login.php:  http://pastebin.com/YYA34sFR
[08:44:54] <Spire> It's the msg parameter on line 31 that contains the exact source from login.php
[08:45:25] <svenlito> Spire: dont use eval
[08:45:30] <svenlito> just sayin..
[08:45:53] <Spire> Yeah, there are a number of things I could clean up in there and make simpler.  :)  I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
[08:46:01] <Spire> Still, it should work the way it is.
[08:47:12] <Spire> If i put an alert(msg); right before the eval call, that's where I see the source.  The other strange thing is that the source is in the msg variable any time the username or password is wrong, and also the *first* time the password is right.
[08:47:39] <Spire> The *second* time I submit it when the password is right, it works correctly and ends up redirecting to index.php.
[08:47:55] <DNX> Hi guys. In my form when I hit enter and in onSubmit I use the ".val()" of the last modified input, I realized that jquery doesn't update that value. This happens only when I hit enter key
[08:48:19] <DNX> how can I solve this?
[08:48:20] <lazyPower> Spire: im probably being pedantic, but when i grab values from form elements, i always reference the id and the val, eg: var email_input =  $('#login_email').val();
[08:48:44] <lazyPower> i'm not real savvy with document.getElementById's behavior
[08:49:21] <Spire> I should do that, for sure.  This ajax query was originally written without jquery, and then I converted it.  I just didn't convert those lines.
[08:49:41] <svenlito> lazyPower: whats your return type?
[08:49:44] <svenlito> html, json ?
[08:50:00] <svenlito> you might want to set that too
[08:50:01] <lazyPower> Spire: i think svenlito  was talking to you...
[08:50:41] <Spire> it should always be json.
[08:51:03] <lazyPower> visit your ajax url in the browser and pass the values manually to verify itts not the ajax php failing.
[08:51:12] <svenlito> Spire: set it: dataType: 'json',
[08:51:15] <Spire> Okay.
[08:51:19] <svenlito> and do what lazyPower said
[08:51:30] <Spire> Ok I'll give it a shot, one sec.
[08:51:30] <lazyPower> hi5 svenlito
[08:51:40] <svenlito> hi5 lazyPower
[08:51:56] <DNX> I fount my problem described without any solution here: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ajax-submit-val-not-submitting-updated-data
[08:52:24] <DNX> any jQuery guru here?
[08:52:27] <DNX> :)
[08:52:33] <lazyPower> nope, no gurus
[08:52:39] <DNX> :D
[08:55:28] <DNX> it'seems that the browser doesn't update the DOM between "ENTER" and onSubmit... :(
[08:55:50] <svenlito> show us your code DNX
[08:55:56] <Spire> Verified, when I visit http://localhost/alpha/ajax_login.php?email=<my_email>&passwd=<pass>, everything works fine, the output is {"result":"success","success":"Successfully logged in."} as it should be.
[08:56:04] <Spire> After changing all the _POSTs to _GETs of course.
[08:57:13] <lazyPower> Spire: ok, next step is going to be to modify your ajax call, by adding a data type
[08:58:18] <DNX> svenlito, very simple: <form><input id="my_input"><input onSubmit="window.location.href = '/'+$('#id_number').val()+'/';" type="submit" value="Submit"></form>
[08:58:49] <DNX> * $('#my_input').val()
[08:59:53] <DNX> when you click on Submit, everything is ok. But on ENTER press $('#my_input').val() has the old value
[09:01:56] <Spire> Ok, now after adding the dataType: "json", firebug shows a correct response.
[09:02:12] <Spire> of course I had to remove the eval but now it looks like it's working.
[09:02:27] <Spire> Strange, though, that it gave me page source without the data type in there.
[09:03:15] <DNX> svenlito, the only solution I can see in this situation is to store the value input in a variable on onChange...
[09:03:31] <DNX> and the use it in onSubmit
[09:03:37] <DNX> *then
[09:04:32] <svenlito> DNX: well first of all, mark it up properly
[09:04:40] <svenlito> the input has a missing type
[09:04:42] <lazyPower> Spire: wonky behavior to be sure
[09:05:26] <youngin> Does anybody know a better way of doing a dropdown menu than http://www.queness.com/post/1047/easy-to-style-jquery-drop-down-menu-tutorial ? Superfish got too bloated and hard to handle!
[09:05:26] <svenlito> DNX: you also might want to catch click on the submit and keydown on the text field
[09:05:37] <Spire> Thanks lazyPower and svenlito, you guys are awesome!
[09:06:04] <svenlito> Spire: we feel particularly awesome now
[09:06:18] <youngin> hehe
[09:06:27] <lazyPower> svenlito: hi5 again for the tag team
[09:06:41] <svenlito> lazyPower: gimme beer
[09:07:09] <lazyPower> svenlito: it is after noon here. i have some PBR in the fridge
[09:07:17] <lazyPower> svenlito: c'mon over
[09:07:42] <svenlito> lazyPower: its 5pm here. pourfect
[09:08:02] <lazyPower> sweeden?
[09:08:13] <svenlito> uk
[09:08:20] <lazyPower> excellent. pub crawl it is
[09:08:25] <svenlito> hehe
[09:08:26] * youngin gives svenlito and lazyPower some fine Singaporean beer
[09:08:26] <jessicaf> how to set a number in a text box and then increase the number by 1 in it everytime when the page is refreshed
[09:08:30] <youngin> So guys -
[09:08:34] <lazyPower> nobody likes mondays anyway... lets get retarded
[09:08:43] <youngin> Does anybody know a better way of doing a dropdown menu than http://www.queness.com/post/1047/easy-to-style-jquery-drop-down-menu-tutorial ? Superfish got too bloated and hard to handle!
[09:09:07] <lazyPower> youngin: thats a subjective question. If you want to build your own drop down menue, there are hundreds of tutorials on it.
[09:09:07] <svenlito> jessicaf: what, why?
[09:09:27] <youngin> lazyPower: I wish to yes, I but what tutorial is best?
[09:09:38] <youngin> Best as in most recommended by experts, most simple, neat and elegant
[09:09:40] <jessicaf>  i am doing a form and i need to know how its done
[09:09:49] <svenlito> lazyPower: hate Mondays..
[09:09:55] <youngin> Best in your opinion - best for cross-browser compatibility and accessibility
[09:09:59] <lazyPower> youngin: that is subjective as well. my best advice is to hit up google and roll up your sleeves and get ready to learn.
[09:10:24] <youngin> dont give me that subjective shit nigga please
[09:10:35] <lazyPower> keep it family friendly in here now
[09:10:39] <svenlito> youngin: easy..
[09:10:51] <youngin> listening too much to hiphop, dont mind me
[09:11:10] <svenlito> jessicaf: you'd need to store that number somewhere and then when the page gets loaded increase
[09:11:11] <youngin> http://www.queness.com/post/1047/easy-to-style-jquery-drop-down-menu-tutorial came up first in google - im just curious if y'all seen anything better thats all
[09:11:26] <youngin> all i wanna do is to escape the bloated mess of superfish - all fat and no muscle, f* that
[09:11:38] <svenlito> youngin: whatever works best for you
[09:11:44] <jessicaf> <input name="count" type="text"/> it shows no value inside the text box .. i want to know a number inside this text box and increment it by 1 everytime the page is refreshed
[09:11:48] <lazyPower> jessicaf: well if its just a per instance basis, then a cookie. if not you'll have to store it on the server, probably in a text file, or a static global that is then output on the page.
[09:11:52] <youngin> svenlito: whats that suppose to mean??
[09:12:09] <youngin> aka "that's subjective" oh boy here we go again
[09:12:33] <svenlito> youngin: precisely
[09:12:43] <jessicaf> is there a way to get session variable from another .php and make them show in the form
[09:12:49] <lazyPower> youngin: if ya dont like our advice, you can pay the 10 dollar toll and receive professional grade help, in which case we will google one for you without reading it and paste it in here.
[09:13:01] <svenlito> jessicaf: ask in #php
[09:13:02] <youngin> lazyPower: i will gladly pay
[09:13:17] <svenlito> ha
[09:13:20] <youngin> jessicaf: will help you in return for cybersex
[09:13:24] <lazyPower> ...
[09:13:27] <jessicaf> i could
[09:13:40] <lazyPower> whats the number for abuse svenlito?
[09:13:42] <youngin> nice
[09:13:58] <jessicaf> i meant i could ask in #php
[09:14:01] <jessicaf> never thought of that
[09:14:07] <svenlito> lazyPower: eh?
[09:14:31] <youngin> jessicaf: don't let the opportunity to experience some of the youngin slip away now !!
[09:14:58] <jessicaf> fold your cock an shove it up your arse
[09:15:28] <youngin> honestly
[09:15:38] <youngin> right now its so hard it cant be folded
[09:15:45] <youngin> bitch
[09:15:48] <youngin> (sorry guys)
[09:16:12] <lazyPower> youngin: better stop, abuse reporting is as easy as sending the transcript of the last 2 minutes.
[09:16:51] <youngin> was just trying my luck - ive stopped now
[09:18:23] <cups> hey guys, I have an iframe in a page, and I need to be able to adjust the height of the iframe based on actions within the iframe document.. how do I selec tthe iframe height from within the iframe?
[09:18:40] <cups> is top involved?
[09:19:06] <cups> so let's say someone pushes a button on the page within the iframe, the iframe itself changes height
[09:19:13] <cups> is that possible?
[09:19:35] * svenlito is not getting involved in any iframe related business..
[09:19:42] <cups> ;)
[09:20:33] <lazyPower> cups: from what i recall, its not plesant trying to do what you're attempting. Modifying the parent document's properties from within an iframe embed.
[09:21:20] <cups> is there an easy way to adjust an iframe's height based on the height of its contents?
[09:22:08] <lazyPower> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/525992/resize-iframe-height-according-to-content-height-in-it
[09:26:21] <lazyPower> svenlito: i have some source for you if you have a second
[09:26:43] <svenlito> lazyPower: 1 sec
[09:27:14] <svenlito> lazyPower: ok shoot
[09:27:23] <lazyPower> sec throwing it up on gist
[09:28:23] <lazyPower> forgive me on the formatting, i need to clean this up
[09:28:26] <lazyPower> https://gist.github.com/1047749
[09:28:58] <lazyPower> line 13 - 25 are my problem spots
[09:29:17] <svenlito> lazyPower: needs a cleanup indeed
[09:29:21] <svenlito> ok gimme a sec
[09:30:23] <svenlito> lazyPower: care to explain the prob?
[09:30:39] <lazyPower> ah right sorry was helping the lass that wanted to do sessions + jquery
[09:30:46] <lazyPower> explaining how she can do that, so in and out
[09:30:55] <svenlito> np mate
[09:31:01] <lazyPower> well, its copying the elements, but hte transforms are not being performed
[09:31:17] <lazyPower> its not stripping the <li> from the associated cloned object, nor is the visibilty on the span being correctly re-set
[09:31:31] <lazyPower> it shows in source that its display: block;, but not showing up... i'm scratching my chin thinking "uhh..."
[09:31:57] <lazyPower> svenlito: want to see it in practice?
[09:32:07] <svenlito> lazyPower: might help
[09:32:15] <lazyPower> http://www.coderchuck.com/Home/About
[09:33:01] <lazyPower> forgive the sloppyness of that as well :P bad 1990's design skills over here.
[09:33:17] <svenlito> lazyPower: hehe
[09:34:01] <svenlito> lazyPower: i open the console on this page and it starts throwing errors at me
[09:34:09] <lazyPower> oh oh
[09:34:10] <lazyPower> hang on
[09:34:25] <lazyPower> i'm not seeing any in firebug coupled to FF 5
[09:34:36] <lazyPower> which browser svenlito ?
[09:34:43] <svenlito> lazyPower: chrome
[09:34:46] <svenlito> doh ;)
[09:35:05] <lazyPower> yeah i see 2 404's and then some warnings
[09:35:09] <lazyPower> but nothing javascript related
[09:35:16] <lazyPower> i'm doing some massive revamping to this ancient codebase
[09:35:27] <svenlito> ok ill ignore them for now
[09:35:45] <svenlito> it says there is a syntax error in L#105 tho
[09:35:51] <lazyPower> i started this homebrew blog project for <censored> and grins.. got bored and decided to give it some spice...
[09:36:09] <lazyPower> Interesting, there is no line 105
[09:36:18] <svenlito> hmk
[09:36:27] <svenlito> moving on to the real issue..
[09:36:30] <svenlito> hehe
[09:36:32] <lazyPower> haha
[09:36:36] <lazyPower> <3
[09:37:19] <lazyPower> OH
[09:37:19] <lazyPower> wait
[09:37:30] <lazyPower> let me push my latest dev copy, i forgot i'm looking at localhost, not my IIS box
[09:37:34] * lazyPower smacks his forhead
[09:37:59] * svenlito smacks lazyPower's forhead twice for using IISâ€¦
[09:38:02] <lazyPower> ok that should have copied over a big fix
[09:38:10] <lazyPower> as in, not complete garbage
[09:38:19] <lazyPower> only mostly garbage
[09:38:27] <svenlito> NIN eh..
[09:38:37] <svenlito> how old are we??
[09:38:41] <lazyPower> I listen to everything from techno, to classical to death metal mate
[09:38:42] <svenlito> he he
[09:38:42] <lazyPower> 28
[09:39:25] <svenlito> ok, this looks better now
[09:39:30] <lazyPower> i bet!
[09:39:43] <lazyPower> i think you were looking at my trash dev push from lastnight when i was up at 2am fiddling with things
[09:40:00] <lazyPower> redbull != code enhanser
[09:40:02] <svenlito> looked pretty much like that
[09:40:28] <FuzzyNuts> lol lazyPower
[09:40:33] <FuzzyNuts> Uh oh
[09:40:38] <FuzzyNuts> CPU is at 58C
[09:40:40] <FuzzyNuts> D:
[09:40:56] <svenlito> lazyPower: just trying to replicate the prob
[09:40:58] <lazyPower> FuzzyNuts: give it some redbull, it'll get wings
[09:41:12] <lazyPower> click on any album art image. you'll see that the elements are not getting the proper transforms
[09:41:26] <FuzzyNuts> lazyPower, lulz
[09:41:36] <svenlito> lazyPower: you mean position ?
[09:42:12] <lazyPower> svenlito: nah, the idea behind hte script is on mouse over it gets attention, then on click it clones the element into the "feature" div, and should then strip the li, and show the track info inside that div by unhiding hte span.
[09:42:36] <svenlito> lazyPower: oh i c
[09:42:42] <lazyPower> am i doing it wrong?
[09:42:44] <lazyPower> :P
[09:42:47] <lazyPower> haha
[09:43:09] <lazyPower> (which is pretty much how i prefix all of my posts on Stack Overflow)
[09:43:28] <svenlito> lazyPower: there is no "right" way
[09:43:38] <lazyPower> yeah but super geeks get off on telling people they are doing it wrong.
[09:43:47] <lazyPower> sorry, allow me to rephrase... elitest geeks
[09:44:27] <svenlito> well id say there is def room for improvement
[09:44:44] <lazyPower> if you point, i'll research, refactor, and repost
[09:45:09] <svenlito> ok 1 sec ill need some more time to look at it
[09:45:12] <lazyPower> ok
[09:46:40] <svenlito> lazyPower: if your having trouble getting rid of the li
[09:46:45] <Famic> how can I include jquerymobile.js or not depending on the screen width ?
[09:47:01] <svenlito> why not clone just the content and append all of it to lfm-feature
[09:47:28] <svenlito> which is sort of what your doing anyways
[09:47:33] <lazyPower> .. why...didnt..i think... of that...
[09:48:13] <svenlito> so instead of getting the list item that contains the "thing" just get the "thing"
[09:50:05] <lazyPower> awesome, three character fix
[09:50:10] <lazyPower> appended img at the end of the selector
[09:50:15] <djQuery> morning
[09:50:21] <lazyPower> djQuery!
[09:50:22] <svenlito> lazyPower: hi5
[09:50:43] <lazyPower> svenlito: hi5 :D
[09:50:47] <svenlito> haha
[09:51:31] <djQuery> Famic: isnt that something you should be doing server side by sniffing the browser agent? I know .net allows a lotta stuff in this regard
[09:52:01] <lazyPower> PHP, and RoR does as well
[09:52:12] <svenlito> Famic: mediaqueries
[09:52:18] <svenlito> nah
[09:52:21] <Famic> svenlito: for js ?
[09:52:24] <svenlito> soz
[09:52:44] <Famic> I wish I could
[09:53:00] <djQuery> lazyPower: have you looked at see ?.tmpl
[09:53:01] <bot-t1> lazyPower, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[09:53:38] <lazyPower> djQuery: you're a machine
[09:53:51] <lazyPower> you wake up, and resume Q&A like its breathing
[09:54:05] <svenlito> djQuery lazyPower or you use mustache which can be used server side as well
[09:55:48] <lazyPower> Interesting, using the template approach, i could probably drop the linq in the frontend and just embed a json array, and manip it from there
[09:56:08] <svenlito> lazyPower: thats what people tend to do a lot nowadays
[09:56:32] <lazyPower> i wrote a video scholarship portal (www.university-bound.com/scholarships/) using that principal in the admin panel
[09:56:40] <djQuery> svenlito: the newest .tmpl can be used server side as well I believe. I am moving on to .jsviews so that I can do datalinking basicaly.
[09:57:02] <djQuery> I am trying to write basicaly a jsfiddle for DBs
[09:57:14] <lazyPower> that would be sweet
[09:57:23] <svenlito> djQuery: i meant none js servers
[09:57:23] <djQuery> lets you design a database online and give a nice look to it.
[09:57:36] <svenlito> i.e. python, rails, .net yuck..
[09:57:52] <djQuery> svenlito: yes I doubt that .tmpl will ever work non js server
[09:58:30] <lazyPower> I'm suprised you guys arent node.js fans since you have such an intricate knowledge of jquery/js
[09:58:32] <djQuery> but after you select a db you can add collumns\table and output in different sql languages
[09:58:52] <djQuery> lazyPower: I have to much vested in .net
[09:58:53] <svenlito> djQuery: sounds pretty cool
[09:58:58] <technoisy> slideDown() to a hash position && absolute positioning
[09:59:06] <technoisy> ?position slideDown()
[09:59:08] <djQuery> and there arent a whole lotta jobs
[09:59:09] <bot-t1> technoisy, #7824 (IE7 slideUp / slideDown within position:relative containers ... - Opened 6 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7824
[09:59:13] <lazyPower> djQuery: i hear ya there. I'm up and coming in .net -- about a half a year of experience in it.
[09:59:35] <technoisy> there are lots of Jobs here @ djQuery
[09:59:45] <svenlito> people still use .net?
[09:59:51] <technoisy> I use .net
[09:59:58] <djQuery> technoisy: I need one got one to spare?
[10:00:01] <lazyPower> svenlito: seems to be a humungus following svenlito .
[10:00:04] <technoisy> Besides web apps. but desktop app.
[10:00:22] <technoisy> djQuery it depends on your expertise Sir
[10:00:32] <lazyPower> svenlito: between my 5 years of PHP and my newly acquired .net, i'm not having trouble finding work *knocks on his desk*
[10:00:37] <technoisy> can I pm you?
[10:01:01] <svenlito> but then on the other hand.. people still use coldfusion too
[10:01:08] <lazyPower> ick
[10:01:10] <lazyPower> but yeah
[10:01:11] <svenlito> not that i feel that those too are worth comparing
[10:01:19] <svenlito> but yeah
[10:01:32] * technoisy brb
[10:02:12] <djQuery> when did I suddenly become Sir?
[10:02:40] <technoisy> I dont use ASP.net i mean. I use c# and VB.NEt
[10:02:42] <technoisy> ??
[10:02:56] <technoisy> djQuery ?sir
[10:03:13] <djQuery> technoisy: I started with vb.net and ditched it for c#
[10:03:15] <technoisy> Well, Sir Is just a polite way of refering to others from my side.
[10:03:40] <djQuery> calling me sir is like puttin an eleveator in an outhouse. it just dont belong
[10:04:05] <technoisy> Ok, I understand, perhaps there are no titles attached yet
[10:04:22] <lazyPower> haha
[10:04:30] <lazyPower> elevator => outhouse != compute
[10:04:40] <svenlito> ha
[10:04:45] * technoisy Im out
[10:04:53] <djQuery> later
[10:04:58] <svenlito> bai
[10:05:06] <technoisy> bai => bro in india
[10:05:07] <technoisy> ?
[10:05:10] * lazyPower drags his feet on re-writing this to be a json array
[10:05:22] <technoisy> talked with alot of channai guys recently.
[10:05:24] <technoisy> later
[10:05:34] <svenlito> nope
[10:05:37] <djQuery> lazyPower: see ?jsonhint
[10:05:38] <bot-t1> lazyPower, Sunday, 2011-05-22 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110522.log.html
[10:05:54] <djQuery> dang see >jsonlint
[10:06:18] <technoisy> before I got, djQuery how do I slideUp or slideDown to a fixed position?
[10:06:37] <technoisy> to an absolute postion rather
[10:06:42] <lazyPower> djQuery: whats jqadmin got to do with it?
[10:06:44] <technoisy> got = go
[10:08:00] <djQuery> lazyPower: nothin it was a typo. I ment to direct you to jsonlint when you said you were converting to json array
[10:08:12] <lazyPower> ah
[10:08:15] <djQuery> lazyPower: see ?jsonlint
[10:08:15] <bot-t1> lazyPower, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[10:08:34] * djQuery CAFINEE
[10:08:38] <lazyPower> djQuery: newtonsoft json .net lib handles serializing json fairly well from objects/structs
[10:08:42] <lazyPower> i use it fairly often at work
[10:09:19] <djQuery> lazyPower: I think it is faster than the json that comes with .net
[10:09:32] <lazyPower> the newtonsoft lib?
[10:09:36] <djQuery> yes
[10:09:38] <lazyPower> indeed
[10:09:56] <lazyPower> benchmarks, its usually a few hundred ms quicker on large data structures
[10:10:49] <djQuery> back to beating my head on desk trying to understand undocumented jsviews
[10:11:03] * lazyPower slides djQuery some advil
[10:12:07] <djQuery> if nothing else it will make a good blog post
[10:12:17] <lazyPower> indeed
[10:12:24] <lazyPower> you'll have to slide me the url when you post it
[10:12:37] <djQuery> davidjquery.com
[10:13:03] <djQuery> thought about having it put a link  to my blog when I log off but then I never log off
[10:13:37] <svenlito> lazyPower: whats the highscore on dasroot? :)
[10:15:04] <lazyPower> svenlito: my   personal best is 60k
[10:15:09] <svenlito> geez
[10:16:13] <lazyPower> it amuses me that wordpress is the defacto standard for blog platforms
[10:16:14] <djQuery> 7,300 and got bored
[10:16:26] <lazyPower> yeah its a concept :P
[10:16:39] <lazyPower> i have tons of time to kill when my family calls me
[10:16:40] <svenlito> lazyPower: imagine it'd be joomla..
[10:16:48] <lazyPower> svenlito: shame on you

[10:20:53] * lazyPower wanders off for food
[10:22:44] <djQuery> **me finaly got jsviews to render at least. http://jsbin.com/uxenub/9/edit
[10:23:39] <svenlito> djQuery: it was about time
[10:24:10] <djQuery> svenlito: hey man I been awake for 23 mins cut me some slack
[10:24:20] <svenlito> hehe
[10:24:34] <djQuery> well been up for 23 mins not neccessarily awake yet
[10:24:45] <svenlito> djQuery: breakfast?
[10:24:59] <djQuery> yes Dr.Pepper + poptart
[10:25:19] <svenlito> delicious
[10:26:15] <lazyPower> hah
[10:26:31] <lazyPower> poptarts, one the few foods that will remain post apocalypse
[10:29:22] <djQuery> lazyPower: and twinkies
[10:29:43] <lazyPower> djQuery: as made famous by zombieland
[10:30:02] <djQuery> cant eat snowballs since watchin clerks
[10:30:08] <lazyPower> haha
[10:30:24] <lazyPower> just try not to suck <... ....> on the way to the parking lot
[10:30:25] <DoctorDarren> Is this a 'blocking' command or a callback, e.g. nothing else after it will be executed before it's finished?
[10:30:28] <DoctorDarren> $(this).parent().remove();
[10:31:14] <djQuery> DoctorDarren: yes thats blocking but that shouldnt take 2.ms
[10:31:39] <djQuery> I typicaly do $(this).closest('tr').remove()
[10:32:01] <djQuery> gnarf ?
[10:32:10] <DoctorDarren> djQuery: Thanks! Yeah I actually want it to be blocking, right after it's executed I count the current number, so I want to make sure it's been removed before counting
[10:32:15] <djQuery> .seen gnarf
[10:32:16] <hsbot> gnarf was seen 1 day, 19 hours and 27 minutes ago, in #jquery-dev, saying: is there any reason for this page to still exist: http://docs.jquery.com/AjaxQueue
[10:35:39] <djQuery> var $t = $(this), $tbody = $t.closest('tbody') trCount = $tbody.children('tr').length; $(this).closest('tr').remove(); if((trCount-1) !== $tbody.children('tr').length){ console.log('wtf');}
[10:36:10] <djQuery> shouldnt ever happend
[10:36:21] <djQuery> DoctorDarren: ^^^^
[10:36:57] <kborchers> djQuery: joined the room right before you posted that line of code. absolutely hilarious out of context ;)
[10:36:59] <djQuery> finding the missing , is up to you
[10:37:12] <djQuery> (12:31:57 PM) DoctorDarren: djQuery: Thanks! Yeah I actually want it to be blocking, right after it's executed I count the current number, so I want to make sure it's been removed before counting
[10:37:22] <djQuery> kborchers: ^^^^^
[10:38:04] <kborchers> i see. i guess i understand the logic now, still kinda funny
[10:38:43] <djQuery> shouldnt ever be neccessary. .remove aint gonna fail les u wrote ur selector wrong
[10:38:50] <kborchers> agreed
[10:39:15] * djQuery back to jsviews fun
[10:41:29] <DoctorDarren> djQuery: Well it's not for a table, but basically a set of divs. Each div has a "Remove" button, and if I remove one I need to reset the ID/names in order from 0 up. So if I have div 0, 1, and 2. If I remove 1, foreach remaining div I go thru and reset IDs/names starting concurrently from 0, so the remaining 2 (0 and 2) will become 0 and 1.
[10:41:47] <djQuery> DoctorDarren: still the logic should be the same
[10:42:01] <DoctorDarren> Am I making use of $(this) correctly here?: http://dpaste.com/559400/
[10:42:16] <DoctorDarren> The inner nested ones don't seem to work.
[10:42:19] <djQuery> and ie hates it when you change the id after the item is in the dom
[10:42:56] <DoctorDarren> Damn. Well I have no other way around it it seems.
[10:43:12] <DoctorDarren> Have to reset the IDs to allow for removing of divs.
[10:43:16] <djQuery> DoctorDarren: well it would be a lot better if you cached $(this) instead of calling so many times.
[10:43:31] <djQuery> also you can set multiple attr at the same time
[10:44:08] <DoctorDarren> djQuery: Ah, will make those changes thanks. But should it at least work how it currently is?
[10:44:42] <djQuery> $(this).attr({name: 'rrf-' + index +'-room', id: 'id_rrf-' + index + '-room'});
[10:45:51] <djQuery> DoctorDarren: basicaly you only need to cache $(this) in the outer each since with the attr change you will only be using $(this) once
[10:46:19] <djQuery> but I think your inner this would be overwritting your outer this
[10:47:13] <djQuery> DoctorDarren: try not to use dpaste as I dont see an easy way to edit it for you there. next time try to use jsfiddle or jsbin
[10:47:50] <DoctorDarren> djQuery: I'll make the changes and see if I can get it to work.
[10:48:01] <DoctorDarren> How badly does IE hate changing the DOM ids?
[10:48:11] <djQuery> by the way are u familar with see .end
[10:49:30] <djQuery> $(this).find(':input').each(function(i,elm){}).end().find('label[for]').each(function(){});
[10:49:34] <djQuery> ?.end
[10:49:35] <bot-t1> .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[10:49:39] <DoctorDarren> djQuery: No but I'll check it out. Don't use jQ very often

[10:55:58] <cups> hey I'm trying to get some information from contents in an iframe, soo I'm trying var tmp = jquery("#iframe").contents().  I constantly get denied when I try to get anything but the entire dom
[10:56:06] <cups> can I do it that way
[10:56:19] <cups> and then maybe access the properties of the object from the local variable?
[10:57:24] <djQuery> cups: ?sop
[10:57:32] <djQuery> cups see ?sop
[10:57:32] <bot-t1> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[10:58:56] <cups> djQuery, is there no way to work around it?  I find that if I do jQuery("#ytframe").contents(); in jquerify I can get the whole dom
[10:59:20] <cups> so maybe from the parent I can use info from the dom I return from jQuery("#ytframe").contents();  ?
[10:59:56] <cups> it's kind of frustrating, I just want to adjust the height of the iframe based on the contents
[11:00:01] <djQuery> cups: i dont know I dont work with iframes because of this exact issue.
[11:00:21] <djQuery> cups: momma says iframes are the devil
[11:00:54] <cups> dj, do you know how I would use the alert function to show me the entire contents of a dom?
[11:01:13] <cups> instead of just object obj
[11:01:17] <kborchers> ?alert @ cups

[11:03:00] <abjorn> allo
[11:03:06] <abjorn> well, been up for awhile, but yeah, morning haha
[11:07:28] <djQuery> anyone know of a documented template\datalinking  plugin?
[11:11:23] <djQuery> emphasis on the DOCUMENTED
[11:29:14] <engaged> I am loading the wordpress audio player standalone into an ajax datatables via json but it is not executing the javascript for the recording audio embed... is there a reason why or how to fix it?
[11:29:24] <error4o4> looking for a simple menu, mouseover > shows custom html div.. something like this: http://www.icebreaker.com/site/index.html   any hints?
[11:31:29] <djQuery> error4o4: thats pretty simple depending on how you layout your html see ?toggleslide
[11:31:30] <bot-t1> error4o4, .slideToggle() - Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[11:33:03] <error4o4> djQuery, bot-t1: thanks i'll try to code that. I guess it shouldn't be that hard,    menu  is gonna be  like  <ul><li>ITEM1<div class="submenu">..</div></li> .....
[11:34:01] <djQuery> yeah just hide the sub div via css then show it via a mouseenter on the parent
[11:34:39] <djQuery> error4o4: you could even do it with just css if you didnt care about an animation. or even with an animation
[11:35:19] <error4o4> djQuery: no animation required, simple css display is fine.   i guess hints are  mouseenter/mouseleave events?
[11:35:52] <djQuery> .parent .child {display: none;} .parent:hover .child { display: block;}
[11:36:48] <djQuery> error4o4: I am doing the same thing here http://jsbin.com/uxenub/10/edit
[11:36:58] <djQuery> look at caption:hover .buttons {
[11:41:23] <error4o4> djQuery: would it be safe to do :hover on non <a> tags
[11:46:22] <djQuery> error4o4: hover is one of the standard events that all elements support
[11:47:51] <djQuery> error4o4: you can see that I am using it on tables and table captions here http://jsbin.com/uxenub/12/edit
[11:48:13] <djQuery> drag on of them to where they are over lapping
[11:48:32] <djQuery> then hover over the one thats in the back
[11:48:52] <error4o4> djQuery: yea I saw. ok i did a test menu now with css only   like you said  :hover .submenu {  ... }

[12:01:03] <devinrolsen> np
[12:01:09] <djQuery> devinrolsen: whats the blog engine?
[12:01:22] <devinrolsen> wordpress
[12:01:55] <devinrolsen> I'm sitting in a room with Jeremy Keith right now :) we are working on building a flickr photo backup plugin or api for wordpress right now.
[12:02:02] <djQuery> was wanting to write a wordpress theme that used jqueryui so anyone could change the colors
[12:02:22] <devinrolsen> oh that would be neat
[12:02:31] <devinrolsen> or better yet change the theme based on the time of the visitor
[12:02:35] <devinrolsen> night and day themes
[12:02:37] <devinrolsen> if you will.
[12:02:58] <djQuery> not so much using the ui plugins just the css to get the color ability.
[12:03:16] <djQuery> how many themes have you seen where u like the layout but hated the colors
[12:03:32] <devinrolsen> more than I would like to remember.
[12:03:38] <innociv> Oh my god.
[12:03:41] <djQuery> well this would fix that
[12:03:46] <devinrolsen> indeed.
[12:03:50] <jedimind> guys, i dont mean to alarm you, but i just heard that video killed the radio star
[12:03:52] <innociv> I keep getting in an infinite loop because of a plugin conflict it seems.  I don't get it.
[12:04:46] <DrBitch> hey guys
[12:04:49] <DrBitch> i need some lights here
[12:04:57] <jedimind> devinrolsen, that :hover behaviour btw, is dangerous
[12:04:59] <DrBitch> i'm using jquery autocomplete
[12:05:04] <jedimind> it causes a large number of server requests
[12:05:18] <DrBitch> http://pastie.org/2125703
[12:05:31] <DrBitch> the server is returning ["Sound"]
[12:05:40] <jedimind> unelss you specifically cache that file properly serverside, IE6's way of handling behavior htc files is flawed, every time you hover over something, and ontop of that for EVERY element on the page on page load, it will make a request to the server
[12:05:51] <DrBitch> but for some reason i'm getting 'data.split is not a function' in my firebug
[12:05:54] <DrBitch> any ideas?
[12:05:59] <jedimind> so you can potentially have hundreds or thousands of calls to the server for no reason
[12:09:29] <DrBitch> hey
[12:09:34] <DrBitch> please, some help here
[12:09:35] <DrBitch> :\
[12:11:01] <djQuery> DrBitch: what autocomplete plugin are u using. ui.autocomplete doesnt have a multple
[12:15:18] <DrBitch> djQuery: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete
[12:15:29] <DrBitch> to way to get it working :|
[12:15:45] <DrBitch> no way *
[12:16:01] <djQuery> DrBitch: oh that is old and has basicaly been dropped
[12:16:15] <djQuery> DrBitch: the replacement is see ?ui.autocomplete
[12:16:16] <bot-t1> DrBitch, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[12:16:33] <sean`> SUP BIAATCH
[12:16:39] <DrBitch> :D
[12:16:40] <djQuery> although if the server is returning what u say then not sure why its not workin
[12:16:51] <sean`> jQizzle
[12:16:54] <DrBitch> ui.autocomplete
[12:17:03] <DrBitch> i need a list of matchings
[12:26:41] <djQuery> devinrolsen: http://www.devinrolsen.com/realtime-image-typesetting-with-php-gd/   couldnt u just use  $('form').serialize() to generate your url?
[12:27:55] <devinrolsen> yes, not to mention an ajax manager to cache results and kill old requests.
[12:28:13] <devinrolsen> needs some updating, was a quick post late at night ;)
[12:28:40] <djQuery> cool I just recently found serialize and serializeArray
[12:29:27] <devinrolsen> yeah, I just found this guy on thursday. http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/ajaxManager/
[12:29:39] <devinrolsen> I love it soo much right now.
[12:33:54] <djQuery> devinrolsen: that would realy help with autocomplete
[12:36:52] <fubhy> Hello... I am trying to unbind() the $(window).bind('resize.myresize); event with $(window).unbind('resize.myresize'); but it doesnt seem to work. any ideas?
[12:37:58] <devinrolsen> yeah it has really helped me out with this search page I built that allows you to narrow results with many different search related filters. It helps cause every change for a filter, the results get updated via ajax and creates or updates the filter into the hash url.
[12:38:47] <devinrolsen> thus it allows far few ajax requests between filter type selections and or using the back and forward browser buttons to travers through your hash history.
[12:39:54] <snacks> I'm having a hard time getting .load() and/or .ajax() to work with IE 7 and 8.  I get no errors, but nothing is loaded into the div.  Works fine in FF
[12:40:03] <snacks> Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[12:40:04] <djQuery> ?unbind
[12:40:05] <bot-t1> .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[12:41:14] <Bodu> i tried now over one week to solve this problem. if i use thisurl with test4.html all works fine in all browsers. if i use the index.php/... one $('input').hide('slow'); doesn't work in the latest IE and Chrome. why? http://jsfiddle.net/SCaYU/
[12:42:31] <djQuery> Bodu: are u using a web server or accessing via file://
[12:42:39] <Bodu> im using xampp
[12:42:56] <Bodu> in firefox and opera all is working great with index.php one
[12:45:33] <Bodu> i realy don't know what i should google for... this prob suxx hard
[12:50:05] <Bodu> safari has the same problem
[12:50:37] <fubhy> djQuery, thanks, i know. but $(window).unbind('resize'); seems to be a special case. since it doesnt let you unbind that event.
[12:50:43] <[1]princeES> hello to all...
[12:50:50] <fubhy> it works for all the other events and selectors
[12:50:58] <fubhy> but not for $(window) in combination with resize
[12:51:38] <[1]princeES> I am looking for a plugin to make banner like as http://www.mcfc.co.uk/
[12:51:58] <[1]princeES> in which.. user can watch the video...
[12:52:12] <[1]princeES> also read news...
[12:53:31] <djQuery> fubhy:   $(window).bind('resize', myresize);   myresize = function(){};
[12:53:45] <Jantire> How do I accept and save the data into a variable from an incoming ajax request from the server with jQUery?
[12:53:54] <djQuery> fubhy: well that work for you?
[12:54:12] <djQuery> fubhy: doesnt actualy unbind it just makes it not do anything anymore
[12:55:10] <Jantire>  How do I accept and save the data into a variable from an incoming ajax request from the server with jQUery?
[12:56:03] <fubhy> djQuery, i need to bind and unbind multiple times on one page, so just overriding the function var would cause a lot of troubl
[12:56:10] <djQuery> var mydata = null;     $.ajax({url: "myurl", success(data){ mydata=data}});
[12:59:35] <djQuery> fubhy: well how about setting a div to be 100% and binding to its rezize instead
[12:59:46] <Bodu> if i use thisurl with test4.html all works fine in all browsers. if i use the index.php/... one with the same content. $('input').hide('slow'); doesn't work in the latest IE, Chrome and Safari. why? http://jsfiddle.net/SCaYU/
[13:00:05] <fubhy> djQuery, $(window) is the only element that natively has the resize event
[13:00:14] <fubhy> all others would require an additional resize library
[13:01:17] <djQuery> $(window).bind('resize', function(e){ $('div.content').trigger('resize', e); });
[13:05:59] <djQuery> fubhy: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[13:12:29] <Know1edge> How can I select an element that does not have a child with a certain class ?
[13:13:47] <lazyPower> omg. kfc
[13:14:05] <marktuk1> got an issue where. height() doesn't work in webkit browsers unless called inside $(window).load(function() {  });
[13:14:27] <marktuk1> if i'm using .height in a plugin, do i need to wrap all the code in the plugin inside $(window).load(function() {  }); ?
[13:17:11] <marktuk1> anyone?
[13:19:18] <primepie> is it acceptable ot use $(document).bind/trigger to implement the observer pattern ?
[13:20:55] <atxq> so I want to add various light boxes on screen--does not matter if they overlap each other--and click on each one to bring to the foreground. is this possible?
[13:21:25] <DrBitch> djQuery: hey
[13:21:35] <DrBitch> im now using ui.autocomplete and works very ell
[13:21:36] <DrBitch> well
[13:21:37] <DrBitch> bUT
[13:21:38] <atxq> was wondering if anyone knows or has seens this done before
[13:21:39] <xDROPx> primepie: i've used an edited version of this for pubsub: http://higginsforpresident.net/js/static/jq.pubsub.js
[13:21:57] <DrBitch> I need to follow a link when someone click in the dropdown (results)
[13:21:58] <primepie> xDROPx: thanks, I'll take a look at it
[13:22:15] <DrBitch> i'm using the 'select' event, but, how can I get an attribute for that result?
[13:22:22] <DrBitch> to build my url ?
[13:22:50] <djQuery> atxq: see ui.dialog
[13:23:02] <djQuery> atxq: see ?ui.dialog
[13:23:03] <bot-t1> atxq, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[13:23:24] <djQuery> atxq: no lightboxes that I am aware of allow more than 1 displayed at a time.
[13:23:40] <Jantire> How do I select a button in jQUery that uses <input>
[13:24:01] <atxq> yeah, dialogue is a good alternative to popup multiple div tags, etc.
[13:24:22] <djQuery> Jantire: $('input[type="button"]')
[13:24:29] <atxq> was wondering if there was muliple lighboxes that could be arranged on screen
[13:24:34] <atxq> thanks though
[13:24:47] <Jantire> djQuery is there any way of giving said button an identifier?
[13:24:51] <DoctorDarren> Could any of you fine gentlemen suggest why this line may not work?: http://jsbin.com/oduyus/edit
[13:25:14] <DoctorDarren> Just checking if an element has a for attr, and if it does, alter it.
[13:25:43] <lazyPower> svenlito: my template looks much nicer now
[13:26:49] <primepie> xDROPx: thanks again that's what I wnted :)
[13:26:56] <djQuery> Jantire: sure   $('input[type="button"]).each(function(i,elm){  $(this).attr('id', 'btn' + i); });
[13:26:56] <xDROPx> sweet!
[13:27:10] <xDROPx> i'll post for you my modifications
[13:27:12] <xDROPx> just a minute
[13:27:42] <svenlito> lazyPower: codez or it didn't happen ;)
[13:28:13] <primepie> xDROPx: thanks! I'd be interested to see them bcz I found nothing wrong with the code
[13:29:00] <atxq> you got to admit that multiple lightboxes on screen with background/foreground positioning does sound like an amazing idea
[13:29:32] <djQuery> DrBitch: have you looked at this exmple ? http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[13:31:03] <lazyPower> svenlito: https://gist.github.com/1047943
[13:33:23] <muzone> Hello! I'm trying to make my very own dropdown menu here: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02A - how would you improve it in terms of code, cross-browser support and accessibility?
[13:34:11] <xDROPx> primepie: http://pastebin.com/A9BiFnRD - i think the only really significant thing - is passing a callback context in to the subscribe - and calling the subscribed method with the context from publish
[13:34:19] <djQuery> http://www.barrett-jackson.com/application/onlinesubmission/lotdetails.aspx?ln=655&aid=423&pop=0
[13:34:29] <xDROPx> primepie : i thought there was more - but i guess that was it
[13:36:53] <muzone> Can somebody help?
[13:37:03] <djQuery> ?ask@muzone
[13:37:04] <bot-t1> muzone, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:37:13] <FuzzyNuts> Don't ask to ask, just ask the question
[13:37:20] <svenlito> lazyPower: ouuhlala
[13:37:23] <muzone> Hello! I'm trying to make my very own dropdown menu here: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02A - how would you improve it in terms of code, cross-browser support and accessibility?
[13:37:56] <lazyPower> svenlito: still not perfect, trackign down how i can limit my results to 9 results now
[13:38:08] <FuzzyNuts> if(browser.msie) { alert("Fuck off with you shitty browser"): }
[13:38:11] <FuzzyNuts> Add that
[13:38:11] <djQuery> muzone: yes see ?ui.menubar
[13:38:12] <bot-t1> muzone, jquery-menubar | jQuery Plugins - This plugin for jQuery UI provides a menubar with togglable top-level menu items, multileveled menu items, checkable menu items. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-menubar
[13:38:15] <FuzzyNuts> That will fix it
[13:38:30] <svenlito> lazyPower: pagination like?
[13:38:45] <djQuery> FuzzyNuts: I prefer just running 1 of those scripts that crashes the browser when ie
[13:38:50] <lazyPower> svenlito: no, just cut it off at 9. using hte current methods that i am, i dont see a readly apparent method to limit it to 9 results.
[13:38:58] <muzone> And - how do I make it so that when there's no "ul li ul" - add "border: none;" to #main_menu > li:hover?
[13:39:05] <muzone> FuzzyNuts: hehehe
[13:39:15] <lazyPower> i'm not manually looping through anything, which in itself is kind of interesting.
[13:39:37] <muzone> FuzzyNuts: that actually works? i've been looking for something like that - albeit with more decent english=)
[13:40:03] <svenlito> lazyPower: the jquery object gives you an array
[13:40:12] <svenlito> just use that one to cut of at 8
[13:40:16] <lazyPower> $.tmpl( "PlaylistItem", lfmData).appendTo( ".thumb");
[13:40:21] <lazyPower> not looping :P
[13:40:34] <lazyPower> its a method that crams the entire object into its template routine and fast-outputs
[13:40:44] <svenlito> hmk
[13:40:53] <lazyPower> yeah, i know. i said the same thing
[13:41:33] <svenlito> you can still dosome logic in your template file tho
[13:41:55] <svenlito> cause your markup is within a script tag
[13:42:18] <lazyPower> for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) { $.tmpl("PlaylistItem", lfmData[i]).appendTo(".thumb"); } should work me thinks
[13:42:32] <djQuery> {{each}}  {{if}}{{else}}{{/if}}
[13:42:50] <svenlito> djQuery: thats the one
[13:42:53] <lazyPower> djQuery: any particular advantage to each?
[13:43:18] <svenlito> lazyPower each is a wrapper
[13:43:35] <svenlito> its a fancy for loop
[13:43:41] <djQuery> lazyPower: not relay especialy when you have {{tmpl(childdata) "childtemplate"}}
[13:44:02] <lazyPower> i kind of figured.
[13:44:20] <lazyPower> the for was just to set the counter and increment it.
[13:44:58] <djQuery> lazyPower: yeah he is adding a ${Index} but it aint there yet
[13:45:09] <atxq> how can I return the value inside an html tag, i.e. span tag? is there somethings equivalent for .val()?
[13:45:28] <djQuery> atxq: .html() or .text()
[13:45:33] <svenlito> lazyPower: wrt to the above loop, dont append to tmpl in every iteration
[13:45:39] <atxq> I want to get, not set
[13:45:48] <svenlito> build a new object that has the number of items you want and append
[13:45:54] <djQuery> atxq: the same.
[13:46:11] <atxq> .text() returns too?
[13:46:13] <djQuery> if you dont pass it anything it returns the html\text instead of setting it
[13:46:24] <lazyPower> svenlito: :/ i dont understand why appending per iteration is bad.
[13:46:37] <lazyPower> svenlito: this is where my ignorance shines. i have more questions on why than how.
[13:47:17] <djQuery> lazyPower: have you looked at this? http://jquery.github.com/jquery-tmpl/demos/movies/PagesCore/movies.html
[13:47:32] <svenlito> lazyPower: performance, best practise
[13:47:46] <lazyPower> why no, i have not.
[13:48:08] <djQuery> lazyPower: might wanna check dis out as well. http://www.borismoore.com/2011/04/jquery-bay-area-conference-presentation.html
[13:48:35] <svenlito> good resource djQuery
[13:48:53] <djQuery> svenlito: well seeing as how he is the one that wrote them
[13:48:55] <djQuery> lols
[13:49:06] <svenlito> true that
[13:49:10] <svenlito> ha
[13:49:28] <djQuery> svenlito: trying to upgrade one to use his new jsviews right now
[13:49:39] <marktuk1> if i'm using .height in a plugin, do i need to wrap all the code in the plugin inside $(window).load(function() {}); ? since webkit can't return .height until the image has loaded
[13:50:01] <svenlito> djQuery: see i was wondering what you meant by jsviews already before
[13:50:12] <svenlito> new templating engine i guess
[13:50:30] <piklu> hii guys
[13:50:44] <piklu> anybody in working mode?
[13:50:54] <djQuery> svenlito: extension to .tmpl
[13:51:10] <svenlito> djQuery: oh i c
[13:51:36] <djQuery> svenlito: between that and observable it allows for data binding
[13:51:36] <svenlito> djQuery got any links for docs?
[13:51:58] <djQuery> svenlito: I wish.... its still very early
[13:52:27] <svenlito> djQuery: where is the source ?
[13:52:28] <djQuery> svenlito: http://borismoore.github.com/jsviews/demos/step-by-step/04_editable-data.html
[13:52:40] <djQuery> svenlito: github
[13:52:58] <svenlito> djQuery: cheers dude
[13:53:14] <djQuery> svenlito: https://github.com/BorisMoore
[13:53:49] <djQuery> svenlito: here is what I am working on http://jsbin.com/uxenub/12/edit  gonna be a while
[13:54:04] <svenlito> djQuery: care to explain observables?
[13:54:20] <djQuery> svenlito: not yet as I have not done them yet.
[13:54:24] <djQuery> lolz
[13:54:37] <svenlito> oh man...
[13:54:38] <svenlito> haha
[13:55:31] <djQuery> basicaly it is watching for something to change then updating the object that it was linked to I belive
[13:55:35] <djQuery> oh and vice versa
[13:56:07] <djQuery> svenlito: I am picking those these to see what I can grok http://borismoore.github.com/jsviews/demos/index.html
[13:56:10] <svenlito> so its the link between your template and your data that you pass to tmpl?
[13:56:51] <djQuery> right. so if somethign in the data changes the output is updated and if the output is updated the data is updated
[13:57:07] <djQuery> hope I dont cause a inifinite loop
[13:57:32] <svenlito> oh ic
[13:57:50] <svenlito> knockoutjs has that too
[13:58:18] <svenlito> data binding is hot
[13:59:17] <svenlito> djQuery: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/hh297451
[14:00:10] <svenlito> lazyPower: checkout that article http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/hh297451
[14:01:57] <lazyPower> interesting
[14:02:30] <djQuery> svenlito: havent looked at that library yet
[14:03:01] <muzone> At my dropdown menu at http://www.webdevout.net/test?02A - how would you improve it in terms of code, cross-browser support and accessibility? I notice it isn't always as smooth and easy to navigate.
[14:03:37] <atxq> when I click on a $(".add"), I want to return the id of what was clicked. how can I do that?
[14:03:43] <svenlito> muzone: put your js at the bottom of the page, cache variables etc
[14:03:58] <djQuery> muzone: how many levels can you handle? how does it handle running into the edge of the screen? have you looked at see ?ui.menubar
[14:03:59] <bot-t1> muzone, jquery-menubar | jQuery Plugins - This plugin for jQuery UI provides a menubar with togglable top-level menu items, multileveled menu items, checkable menu items. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-menubar
[14:04:31] <atxq> so basicly I want to click on a class and return the id of that item
[14:05:10] <muzone> djQuery: I only need one level.. im pretty sure it wont ever run into any edges. good questions though..
[14:05:20] <muzone> svenlito: cool, thanks man!
[14:05:24] <muzone> svenlito: jquery too?
[14:05:25] <lazyPower> svenlito: http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/javascript-is-dead-long-live-javascript
[14:05:44] <svenlito> atxq: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/d1z8lbtojb92tvcotdirza
[14:06:02] <djQuery> atxq: $('.someclass').click(function(){ console.log(this.id); });
[14:06:17] <atxq> thanks
[14:06:24] <svenlito> atxq or what djQuery said
[14:06:54] <svenlito> muzone: all your script tags go before the </body>
[14:07:25] <djQuery> muzone: css at the top javascript at the bottom
[14:07:30] <svenlito> lazyPower: readin
[14:07:42] <lazyPower> svenlito: get a coffee, its a long read
[14:08:19] <svenlito> lazyPower: yeah he usually writes quite long articles. quality
[14:09:01] * svenlito gets a tea
[14:10:35] <muzone> thanks yall!
[14:10:51] <djQuery> like this function(a, b, option = {}) {
[14:16:45] <MoTiOnXml> with a right-click mouse event, how do I prevent the default context menu from showing?
[14:16:52] <MoTiOnXml> i'm already suppressing using e.preventDefault();
[14:17:56] <Peter`> Don't do that please, it's highly annoying
[14:18:13] <fourcolors> does anyone know where I can find an example of a google map that has a marker thats outside of the map that you can drag inside of the map?
[14:18:18] <fourcolors> I saw one once, but can't find it
[14:18:28] <MoTiOnXml> Peter`: no it's not, unless you're doing it for the entire document
[14:18:34] <Peter`> fair enough
[14:19:01] <MoTiOnXml> Peter`: anyway, i was using live() with "mousedown", but will use "contextmenu" instead and return false;
[14:19:07] <muzone> svenlito: its that why its real slow to respond?
[14:19:12] <muzone> because the script tags are at the top?
[14:19:44] <svenlito> muzone: script tags block the rendering process
[14:20:07] <svenlito> muzone: the reason why its slow in response might be ur selectors
[14:20:29] <svenlito> you should cache a reference instead of querying over and over again
[14:21:20] <svenlito> lazyPower: awesome article
[14:22:41] <muzone> sounds like something i want  !!
[14:22:49] <muzone> can you help me achieve it though?
[14:23:22] <svenlito> muzone: yeap wait
[14:23:38] <svenlito> muzone: read this http://jqfundamentals.com/
[14:23:50] <svenlito> its all in there
[14:24:04] <muzone> theres not like a line of code you can toss over?
[14:24:16] <muzone> my eyes are hurting from reading jquery tutorials all day
[14:24:58] <svenlito> im sure there is
[14:25:05] <svenlito> cmon man, its not that hard
[14:25:25] <muzone> fuck
[14:25:28] <muzone> dont say that man
[14:25:49] <muzone> whats easy to you might not come easy to somebody else - never take your talents for granted!
[14:26:09] <svenlito> muzone: i agree

[18:13:49] <kam187osx> got a wierd problem where transitioning to a page and then coming back leaves the footer offset by about 20 px up and to the right
[18:14:25] <kam187osx> i also have a search box, and clicking where it _should_ be versus where its actually drawn springs the elements back to where they should be
[18:14:31] <kam187osx> anyone seen anything like this before?
[18:15:16] <Null_> djQuery: trying to fix this problem I have with IE not working with GET parameters like page1.php?id=X, even though chrome/ff are fine. So you suggested awhile back to pass the id inside my .ajax/.load call. I have a generic .ajax call being used for all pages, so I want to hardcode a check that if it sees id=X in the url, add the data to the generic .ajax call. (As I only have 1 case that passes data this way to account for).
[18:16:25] <Null_> if I knew how this framework I'm using worked a bit better I'm sure I could just properly override the generic case as needed, but I dont yet.  Its called ajaxy, if anyone knows it.

[19:02:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> is it possible to do class animations without ui?
[19:03:29] <crack_head> if I do $(".myTest") and it doesn't match anything on the page...what's returned?
[19:03:42] <crack_head> there's an object, but I don't know what kind of object it is
[19:03:48] <crack_head> is there a way to figure this out?
[19:04:29] <crack_head> ...or rather what kind of object it is
[19:09:23] <ryanseddon> it returns an empty array like object
[19:10:07] <ryanseddon> you can use $.type to work out exactly what the object is
[19:17:33] <djQuery> theCole: http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[19:19:05] <djQuery> theCole: and $('#cboDays').children('option[value="Wednesday"]').prop('selected', true); would be faster
[19:19:47] <theCole> very cool
[19:19:57] <theCole> thank you, what i did worked, but i will rewrite to use prop
[19:20:02] <versatiletech> how come this doesn't work? http://jsbin.com/iyahol/edit
[19:20:03] <theCole> i did not know of that
[19:20:14] <djQuery> theCole: what version are u using
[19:20:19] <versatiletech> seems like a bug to me
[19:21:14] <theCole> djQuery: 1.5.1 but i can upgrade
[19:21:19] <theCole> if i need
[19:21:39] <djQuery> theCole: in 1.5 I think it would still be attr. prop aint till 1.6
[19:22:08] <crack_head> ryanseddon: thanks for the info.
[19:22:08] <theCole> djQuery: got it, thanks for the info. very much appreciated
[19:22:18] <djQuery> versatiletech: well ur script might be running before <p> has been generated since you didnt put it in the ready. http://jsbin.com/iyahol/2/edit
[19:22:51] <crack_head> ryanseddon: how do I use $.type?
[19:22:57] <ryanseddon> crack_head: no worries
[19:23:16] <ryanseddon> $.type([]) for example will return "array"
[19:23:17] <djQuery> crack_head: see ?.type
[19:23:18] <bot-t1> crack_head, event.type: Describes the nature of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.type/
[19:23:36] <versatiletech> djQuery: definitely wasn't that: http://jsbin.com/iyahol/3/edit#source

[19:24:47] <crack_head> hmmm...ok
[19:24:53] <djQuery> versatiletech: think the selector there should be labeled filter not selector
[19:25:08] <djQuery> versatiletech: the demo I gave u works http://jsbin.com/iyahol/2/edit
[19:25:13] <crack_head> if it's an object, then will it return 'object'?
[19:25:18] <drupalvan> It looks like there a bug in jQuery 1.3.2. If you go to this link: http://jsfiddle.net/J9dhm/ the toggle doesn't work but if you change jquery to 1.4.4, it works fine. What is the workaround with jQuery 1.3.2? If I remove the first two lines of css, it works fine with 1.3.2
[19:25:25] <ryanseddon> crack_head: yep
[19:25:33] <versatiletech> djQuery: my intention is to clean up some of the HTML
[19:25:50] <crack_head> but what if I want to know what kind of object (maybe this is a silly question)
[19:25:55] <djQuery> versatiletech: then do a .find on it then a .remvoe
[19:26:06] <ryanseddon> crack_head: everything is an object is javascript
[19:26:26] <djQuery> drupalvan: then upgrad?
[19:26:48] <crack_head> is there way to know if I'm getting the jQuery object back?
[19:26:49] <ryanseddon> crack_head: what exactly do you want to do?
[19:26:57] <drupalvan> qjQuery, it's not an easy option in my case.
[19:27:02] <versatiletech> djQuery: should work the way I wrote it though
[19:27:03] <crack_head> ...I was looking at the jquery source and it was returning 'this'
[19:27:07] <djQuery> ryanseddon: get more crack?
[19:27:08] <versatiletech> so it seems like a bug
[19:27:24] <crack_head> ....just trying to understand 'this' as well ;O
[19:27:26] <crack_head> :)
[19:27:34] <versatiletech> anyways, I'll do the find...remove way
[19:27:40] <crack_head> sorry...that was suppose to be a smiley
[19:28:10] <yurio> is there any way to simply intercept the browser back button without using any of the history plugins?, all i wanna do is to run a specifc function in ajax environment instead
[19:28:19] <djQuery> crack_head: dont worry I have smilleys turned off
[19:29:53] <djQuery> yurio: then get anyone of the numerous history plugins. if you dont want to actualy use them then just look at what they do.
[19:30:34] <djQuery> yurio: its kinda a silly question. Hey everyone I know there is something that does what I want to do but I refuse to use it.
[19:32:30] <yurio> ...
[19:43:34] <sreraku> folks is this right place to ask questions on jquery?
[19:43:43] <coldhead> sure is
[19:43:50] <sreraku> Thanks coldhead
[19:44:19] <sreraku> I am learning jquery. My question/s is/are :)
[19:47:39] <sreraku> I am trying to add a searchbox. This box should have an arrow pointing to south and if the user clicks, should display a menu with first level options. then each item should have another level of menu and so on upto 4 levels. I have created these menus but, if i hover my mouse on an item in the first menu, i am unable to show corresponding choices. rather, it displays all the items in the second level.
[19:48:04] <sreraku> my issue is i am not able to integrate the search box with the first level menu
[19:48:23] <sreraku> secondly when i click on an item in first menu only the corresponding second level menu should be displayed
[19:49:15] <sreraku> googling around is not helping me :(
[19:53:02] <sreraku> anyone folks?
[19:56:49] <sreraku> guess no ones here coldhead
[19:59:06] <coldhead> sorry i was taking a phone call
[19:59:20] <coldhead> let me read your question and tell you why i can't answer it
[20:00:04] <coldhead> okayyy that sounds very complicated
[20:00:51] <coldhead> do you have a link to a demo or can you create a demo on jsfiddle, sreraku ?
[20:01:12] <sreraku> basically, if the user just clicks on the search box the whole first level menu is displayed. now the user has a choice to click on the first item which displays relevant second level menu and so on
[20:01:36] <sreraku> or if the user starts typing, the dropdown shows only the matched items in the menu
[20:01:55] <bobbobbins> can't you just show based on a class? .first_level or something?
[20:01:59] <sreraku> i have html, some jscript code embedded and css
[20:02:31] <coldhead> demooo
[20:02:31] <coldhead> more show less tell
[20:03:27] <Beta2K> Hello all
[20:03:42] <Beta2K> Anyone familliar with colorbox?
[20:06:01] <Beta2K> I'm trying to ajax load a php script into colorbox in a onclick event, the box comes up but the content div has display:none in it's css
[20:06:33] <sreraku> coldhead, i am putting it in jfiddle
[20:12:22] <djQuery> sreraku: so basicaly you want them to be able to type firstlvlitem 2ndlvlitem.   while typing the firts one they only get first levl filtering?
[20:12:32] <djQuery> after the space they get 2nd levl items?
[20:14:27] <sreraku> http://jsfiddle.net/wN59f/
[20:14:38] <sreraku> ok thats the jsfiddle
[20:15:02] <Beta2K> NM, fix it, the php script needed to output a div to contain itself within
[20:15:25] <sreraku> djquery, i am trying to put both autocomplete as well as dropdown list
[20:17:25] <djQuery> sreraku: have you looked at ?ui.autocomplete
[20:17:39] <djQuery> ?ui.autocomplete
[20:17:40] <bot-t1> The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[20:18:44] <sreraku> whats the end result should be is, lets say i have the search box which will have an arrow pointing to south, user has a choice. if the user starts typing, then i have to pick the first level of list and do auto suggestion. now if the user clicks on one of the items in the list, it should show second level of list with relevant items ie if the user starts typing "pl" it should show the list containing please, plough, plum etc... and if
[20:18:44] <sreraku> the user clicks on plough it should show a second level menu which has options field, farm, jungle and this goes on multiple levels
[20:19:04] <sreraku> i havent looked at the ui.autocomplete yet
[20:19:07] <sreraku> will do
[20:19:14] <djQuery> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[20:19:24] <djQuery> sreraku: ^^^^^^
[20:19:30] <sreraku> ok
[20:19:56] <coldhead> sreraku: i suspect where you have $('#nav li').hover( you might want $('#nav > li').hover(
[20:20:01] <djQuery> sounds like you want multiple autocompltes there.
[20:20:10] <coldhead> but the bigger picture is do whatever djQuery says
[20:20:19] <djQuery> GIVE ME MONEY
[20:20:24] <djQuery> thanks coldhead
[20:21:05] <sreraku> :)
[20:21:36] <coldhead> you'd better do what he says! (he crazy!)
[20:23:53] <djQuery> sreraku: I would just do a .next('input').show().focus() after they have selected an item
[20:23:56] <sreraku> djquery, its not multiple autocompletes. only the first level is autocomplete the second level is a submenu out of the first level's item
[20:25:29] <djQuery> ?not?

[21:05:38] <sreraku> any help is appreciated plz
[21:05:45] <rainerbird> thanks guys, I'll put my code into JSfiddle and ask in a sec
[21:09:16] <rainerbird> I'm trying to get the current domain of the url. For example, if the url is http://example.com/asdasd/asdasd/ I want to return "http://example.com", and if the url is http://subdomain.example.com/test/ then I want to return "http://subdomain.example.com". I found a question on stack overflow that is exactly what I want (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4815559/how-to-get-domain-name-from-url-using-jquery) and I'm trying to use 
[21:09:26] <rainerbird> Here is the JSfiddle of my code: http://jsfiddle.net/Wb4aN/
[21:10:42] <sreraku> djquery can you please?
[21:11:00] <djQuery> rainerbird: do a console.log(window.location) and see what you have to work with
[21:12:42] <sreraku> here is the full screen result
[21:12:46] <sreraku> http://jsfiddle.net/wN59f/6/embedded/result/
[21:14:05] <ejo> Here's an odd one for you.  I'm moving a div that has position:fixed between two places on the screen.  it starts off in position A with its 'right' property set.  I move it to position B by setting 'right' to 'auto' and animating 'left' to a new value.  Then (upon a certain other event) I move it back to position A by setting 'left' to 'auto' and then animating 'right' back to the value it...
[21:14:06] <rainerbird> djquery: I put in a console.log and it is returning heaps of stuff to work with: http://jsfiddle.net/Wb4aN/1/
[21:14:07] <ejo> ...had originally.  This would be working except for one thing... The animation succeeds in the A->B direction because position A is also the div's original position in the layout when the page is loaded.  But in the B->A direction, when I set 'left:auto' in order to be able to animate 'right' back to position A, the div jumps to A so the animation is moot.
[21:14:51] <ejo> I'm slowly setting up a fiddle for this, but in case anyone already has a suggestion based on my question I'd love to hear it.
[21:14:53] <djQuery> sreraku: looks like what you want to do is do a ui.menu on the ul   it will automagicaly handle all the sub items etc for you.
[21:16:20] <heshanh> guys if i have a link <a href='#tab92'>bla</a>
[21:16:24] <heshanh> how do i select that
[21:16:51] <ejo> no, the link should be <a name="tab92">bla</a>
[21:16:52] <djQuery> sreraku: then if you want to apply filter to the top level on key up of ur  text box just do a filter on the (#menuid>li).filter(function(){ do a text compare here});
[21:16:59] <ejo> then you can http to #tab92 and it will work
[21:17:30] <ejo> (assuming you're talking about anchor links and not just oddly putting a # in a URL)
[21:17:32] <sreraku> thanks djquery. let me try that
[21:17:40] <heshanh> ah i see.  im tryin to fix this issue where when somes oone clicks on it. the page jumps (scrolls) to the top
[21:18:17] <djQuery> heshanh: either way you  could select it by doing $(a[name="tab92"]')   where name is name or href whichever you decide to put in it
[21:18:28] <heshanh> ty guys :)
[21:18:37] <ejo> heshanh: oh.  In that case either you have an anchor link named 'tab92' at the top of the page, or no such link so the browser jumps to top by default.
[21:18:58] <djQuery> heshanh: then you wanna look at see ?.preventDefault()
[21:18:58] <bot-t1> heshanh, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[21:20:24] <heshanh> im not sure what its doing but there are 3 tabs and when you click on them it fades in.  but it also jumps to the top of the page. i cant seem to find the actual code for it anywhere on the cms and i dont have access to the DB so i figured i might rewrte it with jq
[21:22:10] <rainerbird> Has anyone had a look at my JSfiddle problem yet? http://jsfiddle.net/Wb4aN/ - Trying to get the current domain.
[21:23:25] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[21:23:46] <heshanh> can i rewrite the href in way that it wont jump to the top of the page? preventDefault() didnt work :(
[21:23:55] <ProLoser|Mobile> i know about disabling animations for all fx, is it possible to affect only fx in my plugin?
[21:29:43] <ProLoser|Mobile> anyone around?
[21:32:23] <snover> ?anyone @ ProLoser|Mobile

[21:32:27] <djQuery> heshanh: if it didnt work u didnt do it right.
[21:32:58] <ProLoser|Mobile> in webkit inspector, how do i edit a script and then continue running with the mods?
[21:33:04] <djQuery> $('a[href]').click(fucntion(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[21:33:14] <djQuery> u gotta pass e to the funcion
[21:35:06] <heshanh> http://jsfiddle.net/GU9f5/ thats what i did
[21:36:24] <ProLoser|Mobile> does switchClass still work if the from class wasn't there?
[21:37:32] <heshanh> i think what it does it, when the link is clicked it picks up the href and displays the content for that on a div
[21:42:54] <djQuery> ?switchclass
[21:43:20] <heshanh> can i add and attribute to an a tag with jq?
[21:43:31] <djQuery> ?botsnack
[21:43:36] <djQuery> .seen bot-t

[21:43:37] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 17 hours, 57 minutes and 3 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Disconnected by services

[21:44:01] <snover> djQuery: if bot-t is having trouble, sending more commands isnâ€™t going to make it any better
[21:44:02] <snover> :)
[21:44:09] <dr0id> hehehe,. nice
[21:44:10] <djQuery> ProLoser|Mobile: dont think there is a switchclass
[21:44:22] <heshanh> does attr() add a new attribute? or just read whats there
[21:44:30] <djQuery> there is a toggleclass that will add it if it is not there and remove it if it is
[21:44:34] <snover> heshanh: both. welcome to the world of polymorphic functions!
[21:44:38] <Nuck> What browsers can I use AJAX()'s PUT and DELETE and other such methods in?
[21:44:43] <heshanh> ah nice :D
[21:44:50] <heshanh> so if its not ther it'll add it :D
[21:44:57] <snover> um
[21:44:58] <snover> no
[21:45:00] <snover> what?
[21:45:08] <snover> you should read the fine manual.
[21:45:20] <Nuck> snover: I did.
[21:45:33] <Nuck> The API docs say it works in some browsers, but doesn't elaborate on which ones :S
[21:46:00] <snover> Nuck: not you, heshanh
[21:46:03] <Nuck> Ah okay
[21:46:07] <Nuck> lol
[21:46:15] <sreraku> djquery: thanks for all the help. But, even before I go to the ui.menu on ul, I am not able to get the combobox working. I see only the drop down list!! there is no searchbox at all :(
[21:46:18] <djQuery> heshanh: $('#myelm').attr('myattr') gets it, $('#myelm').attr('myattr', 'someval') sets it
[21:46:24] <heshanh> hmm I know you can set a atrrib value using attr, but can i add a new attribute to the element ?
[21:46:36] <djQuery> sreraku: you hve to put in the search
[21:46:43] <djQuery> <input
[21:46:51] <snover> Nuck: all major browsers support put/delete verbs via xhr
[21:47:06] <Nuck> snover: Okay good, I was a bit worried I might have trouble with that :D
[21:47:42] <Nuck> I'm quickly whipping up a way to test my API as I code, just a simple form that lets me pick the method, form data, and target, and then use jQuery to send it off.
[21:48:01] <Nuck> I assume XHR *does* send cookies, right?
[21:48:34] <snover> yes.
[21:49:01] <Nuck> wow, my jQuery's a tad rusty... Been working with Node for too long lol
[21:51:33] <sreraku> djquery: var input = this.input = $( "<input>" )
[21:54:15] <djQuery> sreraku: why dont you try starting smaller.
[21:54:28] <djQuery> sreraku: try just having a 1 level ul
[21:54:39] <djQuery> then add a input right above it.
[21:55:04] <djQuery> as you key up try hiding soem of the li's based on thier text
[21:57:09] <ejo> woohoo, I slayed my dragon
[21:57:35] <sreraku> djquery. yes, I want only one level for now
[21:57:44] <ejo> I've got right- and left-edge pop-out sliders working and immune to fluid layout and window size changes =] =]
[21:57:46] <sreraku> but that should get into that list
[21:57:57] <sreraku> i am trying that now and dont see the search box at all
[21:59:40] <djQuery> var mymenu = ('ul#mymenu'); $('input#search').bind('keyup change', function(){ var val = this.value;  mymenu.children('li').each(function(e,elm){  var $elm = $(elm); elm[$elm.contains(val)?show:hide]();   }});
[22:02:57] <heshanh> i removed the # from the links but it still jumps to the top of the page
[22:05:53] <sreraku> Thanks djquery. I incorporated your suggestion with only one UL and here it is
[22:05:55] <sreraku> http://jsfiddle.net/wN59f/10/
[22:06:05] <sreraku> I still dont see the search box !!!!
[22:06:27] <djQuery> sreraku: well how much money u got then
[22:06:31] <djQuery> I am available
[22:06:41] <djQuery> and can have it done in about 20 mins
[22:07:10] <sreraku> :) sure let me know how much it is
[22:07:14] <sreraku> please
[22:07:26] <sreraku> and i want to learn at the same time :)
[22:07:39] <djQuery> do it is 50 learn is 100
[22:07:48] <sreraku> i know its a bit messy. just that i am trying to learn
[22:07:57] <sreraku> damn learn is very expensive
[22:07:59] <djQuery> ?jqf
[22:08:15] <djQuery> take a look at jquery fundamentals
[22:08:21] <djQuery> learn for free
[22:09:09] <djQuery> or eleoguent javascript also free
[22:09:20] <snover> people canâ€™t find it if you spell it wrong djquery
[22:09:30] <sreraku> hmmm...
[22:09:42] <djQuery> snoover if they google it google will fix it
[22:11:45] <justicefries> however if you find the books useful
[22:11:48] <justicefries> support the authors and buy copies.
[22:12:15] <djQuery> justifries ++++
[22:12:23] <sreraku> thanks djquery. let me try it even harder
[22:26:02] <sreraku> http://jsfiddle.net/wN59f/19/
[22:26:16] <sreraku> this is just copy and paste from the http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[22:26:26] <sreraku> with that input search.
[22:26:46] <sreraku> it still shows dropdown box. guess i am missing something basic
[22:51:23] <coldhead> can anyone please kill me?
[22:51:36] * b0x shanks coldhead
[22:52:23] <coldhead> thanks buddy
[22:52:28] <b0x> np
[22:53:54] * Chibby_ steals coldhead's organs
[23:09:25] <sreraku> for the combobox to work is there a minimum ff version i need to use?
[23:09:39] <dr0id> which combobox ?
[23:09:48] <sreraku> http://jsfiddle.net/wN59f/22/embedded/result/
[23:10:04] <sreraku> thehttp://jsfiddle.net/wN59f/22/
[23:10:23] <sreraku> dr0id: this combo box http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[23:28:38] <Nuck> Okay, so, can somebody give me a snippet of regular jQuery to demonstrate how to PUT with a file?
[23:28:47] <heshanh> hey guys , i have <p id="xx"> <div>, how do i select the div tag after the <p> ?
[23:29:07] <ejo> When you're using .animate(), in the properties map, I see in the demos the properties are named without quotes.  e.g. .animate({opacity: 0.5}).  can they also be quoted?  I want to use a variable in place of the property name.
[23:29:11] <Nuck> Because my multiparts aren't decoding, not on the server, nor on Charles (the Debugging proxy)
[23:30:21] <ejo> heshanh: $('p#xx').nextAll('div').eq(0)
[23:30:42] <heshanh> ty :)
[23:31:33] <encompass> I am trying to use the .live() method to watch for new items in a list.  I understand the basics of how it works as shown in the docs, but how do I get it to work with something like this: $('a[title]').qtip({ rather than click events and so forth?
[23:31:46] <Nuck> WTF is WebkitFormBoundary and why is it in my request body?
[23:33:32] <ejo> To explain my question ^^ a little better, what I want to do is $(some_element).animate({some_property: some_value});   I know the right side of that will work, but will using a variable on the left side of the ':' work?  Or will it just try to animate a property called "some_property" which doesn't exist on the element?
[23:35:46] <coldhead> the LHS can't be a variable, no
[23:36:01] <ejo> ouch, that's going to cause some boilerplate :(
[23:36:12] <ejo> no biggie, just a conditional
[23:36:17] <ejo> just not as smooth
[23:36:21] <ejo> I can deal :)
[23:37:04] <coldhead> one way to do it would be like so: var some_property = 'opacity'; var options = {}; options[someproperty] = '0.8'; $(element).animate(options);
[23:37:21] <suzukiz> can someone assist me with a .html problem please?
[23:37:23] <coldhead> er except spell some_property consistently
[23:37:32] <ejo> coldhead: oh yeah!  that's so close to what I wanted, it's golden
[23:37:36] <ejo> thank you
[23:37:54] <coldhead> good luck ejo
[23:37:55] <coldhead> :)
[23:37:56] <ejo> I forgot about that other way to set object props
[23:38:02] <coldhead> suzukiz: can you be more specific?
[23:38:14] <ejo> thx. this is turning out pretty slick, maybe someday I'll show you and celebrate
[23:38:25] <coldhead> i welcome celebrations
[23:38:26] <royboy777> hey guys, noob here, curious how ic an combine # with $(this).attr() in a selector $('#'.$(this).attr('title'))....  since the titile of the object is the id of the secondary object I need to mess with
[23:38:30] <suzukiz> when i use .html to change the content of a div tag how do i find out the new height of the div?
[23:38:31] <coldhead> also chocolate
[23:38:55] <ejo> royboy777: explain a little more?
[23:39:07] <coldhead> suzukiz: var new_height = $('#somediv').html('lol at the aids').height();
[23:39:09] <coldhead> like that
[23:39:32] <royboy777> ejo: when I click on an img, the title of that img is the id of a div I need to show
[23:39:51] <suzukiz> coldhead: let me try that i did something similar but didn't work
[23:40:06] <royboy777> so when img title="1" div id="1" is the actual thing getting called
[23:40:24] <coldhead> suzukiz: if it still doesn't work pastie your code and we'll take a look
[23:40:48] <coldhead> royboy777: IDs can't start with a number
[23:40:53] <coldhead> #justsaying
[23:41:11] <royboy777> just an example
[23:41:29] <ejo> royboy777: in your click handler you'll just grab the title attribute of the element that was clicked, and use that to select the div you want.
[23:41:31] <coldhead> $('#' + $(this).attr('title'))
[23:42:08] <royboy777> thanks coldhead
[23:42:17] <royboy777> taht is what i needed
[23:42:22] <coldhead> yay!
[23:44:45] <suzukiz> coldhead are you able to see my pastie?
[23:45:38] <djQuery> yo yo
[23:49:08] <pastie> coldhead: http://pastie.org/2127717 by suzukiz.
[23:59:02] <suzukiz> i'm trying to center a modal div in the middle of a browser but one of the child div's height is changed using .html ... my problem is how do i find out the height of div after the content changes so that i can readjust my modal div?? any help is appreciated.
