[07:48:36] <codecutter> Anyone know why this tooltip is not showing up on hover? (using tippyjs see here https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/v6/getting-started/)
[07:48:36] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/bpn70yv5/1/
[07:52:50] <dw1> works with content: $(tooltip).html()
[07:54:03] <dw1> maybe it fixes bad html
[07:55:40] <dw1> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/P5MRCx2HPw/
[07:56:17] <dw1> guess you should use innerHTML
[07:56:19] <dw1> idk
[07:56:54] <dw1> maybe css killing it
[07:57:07] <dw1>           display: none;
[07:57:10] <dw1> :P
[07:57:28] <dw1> thatd be why
[08:00:12] <codecutter> if I need to set the display:none else it would be visible on the page
[08:00:28] <dw1> yeah
[08:00:32] <dw1> just put a wrapper with display:none
[08:00:39] <dw1> and use the innerHTML or html()
[08:00:45] <dw1> for the content
[08:01:00] <codecutter> let me try that
[08:01:00] <dw1> or use a <template> html tag to hold it i think they're hidden by default
[11:49:19] <JohnDoe2> I have a problem understanding the $.when(...).then(...) type stuff. Specifically, I thought that then only runs after when is done, however in this fiddle the function inside when seems to be skipped https://jsfiddle.net/L3roe1qk/
[12:12:22] <JohnDoe2> okay so it seems that only calling functions() works... ish but I still don't understand the difference between calling a function or feeding it directly https://jsfiddle.net/a3fhxb2p/
[12:17:43] <Uhkis> JohnDoe2: when expects a "thenable" (promise) object, not a regular function. https://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[12:20:56] <JohnDoe2> how do I make a function thenable?
[12:21:54] <JohnDoe2> for example '{ testing: 123 }' is considered thenable....
[12:28:11] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/m3dkwq8t/ here's one jquery way
[13:02:07] <robertparkerx> I have a click event that is some how triggering twice on each. I cannot remember how I used setTimeout to makke it so it's only one
[13:16:40] <JohnDoe2> Uhkis thank you!
[13:41:36] <dw1> robertparkerx: if you didnt bind two events then try another mouse.. the technique for ignoring extra clicks is called debounce.. i think a form of it for hardware issues is built into windows tbh
[13:55:56] <codecutter> shorten this $($(popper.innerHTML)[0].innerHTML).first()[0].innerHTML;
[14:01:54] <dw1> you could just use html() instead of busting into vanilla with [0]
[14:01:58] <dw1> since youre already in jquery
[14:08:01] <robertparkerx> This is terrible but works right now https://url.hashdev.org/n
[14:10:08] <dw1> why is it clicking twice
[14:10:24] <robertparkerx> I don't know
[14:19:17] <codecutter> dw1: $($($($(popper.innerHTML).html())).html()).first();
[14:19:25] <codecutter> still not enough
[14:19:45] <codecutter> thats not what you mean, right?
[14:26:17] <dw1> i just meant you can replace [0].innerHTML with .html()
[14:26:21] <dw1> 2x
[14:29:03] <dw1> also how do you set popper
[14:29:12] <dw1> could just select the first child
[14:29:19] <dw1> if it's a template type tag
[14:29:30] <dw1> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[14:29:34] <codecutter> its a parameter of tippy's.onShow()
[14:29:38] <codecutter> nvm
[14:47:03] <codecutter> how would you store some data locally to prevent repeated ajax call to retrieve same data?
[14:53:21] <codecutter> sesstionStorage
[14:53:40] <dw1> a global var if just on one page
[14:54:54] <codecutter> which is a better option. for tooltip data (tool displays a chart, data for a which can be large or small)
[14:55:56] <codecutter> there a multiple tooltips that have unique data sets
[15:07:58] <codecutter> nvm
[22:19:46] <errorous> hello. I've a datepicker set already on page, and I can't control datepicker. How do I bind an change, or keyup or similar to said datepicker input? I think it's using preventDefault()
[22:20:44] <errorous> currently it actually has 2 inputs. One for datepicker, and the other one that's actually used to set value from datepicker
