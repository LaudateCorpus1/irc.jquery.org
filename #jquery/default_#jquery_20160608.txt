[00:14:13] <rjCousineau> pickandmix: css you might have to use background-image: url(''); (notice the quotes)
[00:15:12] <rjCousineau> $('#WhiskyResultDiv1').css({ backgroundImage: "url(\'lib/image/ResultWhisky/"+whiskyName1+".png\')");
[00:15:24] <rjCousineau> $('#WhiskyResultDiv1').css({ backgroundImage: "url(\'lib/image/ResultWhisky/"+whiskyName1+".png\')" });
[00:16:00] <pickandmix> rjCousineau: thanks, what's the diff between the 2 lines?
[00:18:16] <rjCousineau> pickandmix: i forgot the } at the end of the line
[00:18:43] <pickandmix> rjCousineau: I think I figured out why my variable doesn't work, the variable consist "Whisker Maker's Edition"
[00:18:51] <pickandmix> the ' is causing the is sue
[00:18:51] <rjCousineau> ok
[00:18:52] <pickandmix> issue
[00:19:28] <pickandmix> rjCousineau: thansk man!
[00:19:41] <hmmwhatsthisdo> ...is there any way to enumerate the jQueryUI observers subscribed to an event?
[00:20:33] <hmmwhatsthisdo> .clone(true) doesn't appear to copy observers (understandable) so now I'm just trying to figure out any other methods to get the observers reapplied
[01:35:19] <printForever> I'm looking at this code, confused AF http://pastebin.com/3VgmNq1J
[01:35:37] <printForever> how the hell can something be either true or false and have ELSE?!
[01:37:26] <Uhkis> printForever: toggleVat(anything-non-boolean) should take you to else
[01:37:52] <printForever> Uhkis, how the hell can it be non boolean?
[01:38:09] <printForever> the function only recieves... ok, I get it... but... the function should only recieve bool
[01:38:11] <Uhkis> toggleVat('hi, im a string')
[01:38:55] <Uhkis> afaik you cant force types in arguments in js
[01:39:23] <printForever> Uhkis, but since you're writing to code, you know what you want to pass to the function
[01:39:38] <printForever> having else there is... I get a fail safe, but its idiotic
[01:42:41] <printForever> also...
[01:42:47] <printForever> I'm confused...
[01:43:05] <printForever> why is the line 8th switching the Bool value
[01:43:24] <printForever> and how is it possible to return something
[01:43:25] <printForever> ...
[01:44:50] <printForever> when typing into Console toggleVat(true) I get undefined
[01:45:03] <printForever> when I type toggleVat(false) I get undefined
[01:45:28] <printForever> when I try to change var globVatState = false, I get undefined
[01:46:26] <Uhkis> that's clearly not returning anything and there's really no need to
[01:46:49] <printForever> how do I access it and change it?
[01:46:56] <Uhkis> it?
[01:47:10] <printForever> the toggleVat
[01:47:16] <printForever> globVatState
[01:47:48] <Uhkis> window.globVatState ?
[01:48:00] <printForever> window?
[01:48:05] <printForever> but its not a...
[01:48:06] <Uhkis> can't really see the scope from that code
[01:51:09] <Cork> printForever: what the function does is it expects to be called as togglevat(true), togglevat(false) or togglevat()
[01:51:20] <Cork> printForever: if you call it as the last one it toggles the state
[01:51:35] <Cork> and that is why you have globVatState = !globVatState;
[01:55:15] <printForever> thank you Cork
[01:55:36] <printForever> however, when I'm calling toggleVat(anything) it throws undefined
[01:56:00] <Cork> "throws"?
[01:56:23] <printForever> I get undefined
[01:56:33] <Cork> server sitde you mean?
[01:56:38] <Cork> *side
[01:56:43] <printForever> client side
[01:56:48] <printForever> in the console
[01:56:55] <Cork> ya?
[01:57:00] <Cork> the function doesn't return anything
[01:57:07] <Cork> so it always gives you undefined
[01:57:25] <printForever> well... how do I run the function :/
[01:57:36] <Uhkis> just call it
[01:57:38] <printForever> I want to change the globVatState and run the function
[01:57:48] <Cork> printForever: i gave you all the call states it accepts
[01:58:04] <Cork> it won't return the new globVatState though
[01:58:35] <printForever> so...
[01:59:03] <printForever> I change the globVatState var to something and then I just call the function
[01:59:05] <printForever> right?
[01:59:09] <Cork> no
[01:59:14] <Cork> you just call the function
[01:59:30] <Cork> it changes the variable
[02:00:05] <printForever> you've had me and you've lost me
[02:00:06] <printForever> what?
[02:00:12] <Cork> ...
[02:00:16] <printForever> if I call the function, the variable remains the same
[02:00:21] <Cork> if you want globVatState to be true
[02:00:28] <Cork> you call toggleVat(true)
[02:00:31] <Cork> if you want it false
[02:00:38] <Cork> you call toggleVat(false)
[02:00:43] <printForever> it needs to be set via window.globVatState *thanks to Uhkis*
[02:00:45] <Cork> if you want to invert it
[02:00:47] <Cork> you call toggleVat()
[02:00:52] <Cork> ...
[02:00:53] <Cork> NO
[02:00:57] <printForever> Cork, if I do toggleVat(false) it remains the same
[02:00:58] <Uhkis> i didnt say that
[02:01:11] <printForever> and I get undefined as well
[02:01:14] <Cork> ...
[02:01:22] <printForever> :( confused
[02:01:39] <Uhkis> do this in console: window.globVatState; toggleVat(); window.globVatState;
[02:01:50] <printForever> sec
[02:01:59] <printForever> OMG
[02:02:06] <printForever> ^_^
[02:02:06] <Cork> ...
[02:02:11] * Cork cries
[02:02:15] <printForever> nooooooo
[02:02:40] * printForever holds Cork and cuddles him to comfort
[03:06:22] <warden23> Hi, is anyone able to help me with my question. I'm trying to use jquery to accomplish this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37675286/fluid-movement-onclick-from-1-position-to-another I want it so when I click the button it moves slowly to position not just (position) then snaps there?
[03:11:17] <printForever> warden23, you want to move it to the position of the click?
[03:12:59] <Duikb00t> o/
[03:13:55] <Duikb00t> setting up a navigation like this ( actually a modified copy of this: https://codyhouse.co/demo/presentation-slideshow/index.html  )
[03:14:15] <Duikb00t> I have like 30 slides but want to add 1 subnav item to jump to slide 20 for example
[03:14:19] <Duikb00t> seems that's not possible ;(
[03:14:22] <Duikb00t> totally stuck on it
[03:14:45] <printForever> put the slides in an array and target array index on click
[03:15:09] <Duikb00t> they are currently al lin html list items
[03:15:22] <Duikb00t> I tried to mark them with an id to jump to them but that failed
[03:18:20] <Duikb00t> printForever:  how would i put them all in 1 array?
[03:19:13] <printForever> Duikb00t, if you haven't understood my suggestion then I strongly suggest using jQuery slider script
[03:19:18] <printForever> there are a ton of them online
[03:19:34] <Duikb00t> I understand what you are saying but, can I send you the link pm? you will see my issue :D
[03:19:36] <Duikb00t> it are a lot of slides
[03:20:35] <printForever> Duikb00t, I'm not that good at jQuery either... I just know some basics. Someone else would possibly come along and extend some help.
[03:25:15] <Duikb00t> Ok ;)
[03:25:17] <Duikb00t> thx
[03:28:58] <warden23> printForever yes
[03:29:02] <warden23> But I want it to move smoothly
[03:29:14] <warden23> See when you click it.. it snaps to the position rather then a fluid movement
[03:29:28] <warden23> https://jsfiddle.net/csw6wy6j/5/
[03:32:08] <Duikb00t> Hmm dammit
[03:32:15] <Duikb00t> tried an other way with anchors but still fails ><
[03:33:30] <rollingWolf> theres nothing like theslider.slider(12); or something to tell it which index to hop to?
[03:34:11] <Duikb00t> I don't thinks so
[03:34:19] <rollingWolf> Duikb00t, Which slider do you use?
[03:34:26] <Duikb00t> https://codyhouse.co/demo/presentation-slideshow/index.html
[03:34:35] <Duikb00t> I could send you my current presentation in a pm
[03:35:53] <rollingWolf> Duikb00t, Sure you do, scroll down to "events handling"
[03:36:41] <Duikb00t> There is: navigation.on('click', 'a', function(event){
[03:37:33] <rollingWolf> line 18,19, and 20 . . .that begins with var newSubSlidePosition = newSubSlide.index();
[03:38:03] <rollingWolf> Duikb00t, Just set that to 20 or whatever you want instead of .index();
[03:42:57] <Duikb00t> rollingWolf:  that helped me already a lot man
[03:43:18] <Duikb00t> now I have to find a 'smooth' way to attach specific values to my 'navigation click'
[03:43:35] <Duikb00t> Because when removing at index I am able to get that specific slide but im not able to move further
[03:43:39] <Duikb00t> in the presentation
[03:44:40] <Duikb00t> ' newSubSlidePosition ' gives me also the 'current slide'
[03:47:44] <Duikb00t> ( I have a total of 96 slides ) oO
[03:54:30] <Duikb00t> rollingWolf: Have you a suggestion how I could update them? because once.. I add a slide somehwere the whole 'indexing' is broken
[03:56:50] <Duikb00t> I was thinking up setting up a switch and 'slide to a specific slide but that not really dynamic immo
[04:24:00] <Kartagis>  weird stuff. on one file I am making an ajax call to services/file.json with type:'post'. in the other file, I'm doing exactly the same thing and it it requires that I send token along
[04:32:19] <Duikb00t> rollingWolf:  Fixed it!
[04:32:26] <Duikb00t> Added a switch case and moved the slide I want
[04:39:21] <Bored> hi, how i can render div with child to image? i know there is html2canvas but it doesn't render the filter. is is possible to solve it?
[04:40:09] <Cork> Bored: i think you're skipping a bit much of the context
[04:40:18] <Cork> Bored: are you trying to render <img> in a canvas?
[04:40:50] <Bored> i am trying to render div into canvas than put i convert it to image
[04:40:58] <Cork> (also this is prob better aimed at ##javascript, as this has nothing to do with jquery)
[04:41:17] <Cork> Bored: as long as the html is from the same domain it should work fairly well
[04:41:31] <Cork> but there are security constraints on what you can render
[04:41:33] <Bored> Cork yes but i am using html2canvas which is jquery based and they don't like it
[04:42:04] <Cork> you most likely would have to look for a support avenue for that developer group
[04:42:10] <Cork> it is a bit specific for this channel
[04:42:17] <Bored> i am saying there is a problem with html2canvas.js it doesnt render the css: 'filter' or -webkit-filter in my case
[04:42:59] <Cork> (not even sure why it depends on jquery)
[05:50:47] <warden23> with jquery can you put timedelays within a onclick?
[05:50:57] <warden23> So do such and such then it waits 1s and does the next line etc?
[05:51:04] <Cork> no
[05:51:07] <phunkren_> Hi. I've recently removed my jQuery cdn <script> links from my index and moved it to my app.js file. I've added <code> import JQuery from './lib/jquery-2.2.4.min'; </code>, but I keep getting the following error on the console: Uncaught ReferenceError: JQuery is not defined? Any ideas?
[05:51:15] <Cork> you can't ever delay code in js cause that will block the browser
[05:51:30] <Cork> what you have to do is use timers and use the callback to do what you want to be done
[05:51:48] <warden23> ah okay
[05:51:48] <Cork> ex. setTimeout(function() {}, 1000) to execute that a second later
[05:52:19] <warden23> cool let me try that thx Cork
[05:52:33] <Cork> phunkren_: you normally can't import a script inside another script
[05:52:46] <phunkren_> Ok Cork. What would you suggest?
[05:52:48] <Cork> phunkren_: if you do you have to use callbacks to ensure it has been loaded
[05:52:58] <Cork> phunkren_: why remove the <script> link?
[05:53:13] <phunkren_> Client has requested it be loaded locally
[05:53:17] <phunkren_> Cork
[05:53:32] <Cork> phunkren_: so just store a copy on the local server and load that
[05:53:47] <phunkren_> Ah
[05:53:54] <phunkren_> But keep the <script> tag in index?
[05:54:21] <phunkren_> Cork (I always forget to tag) :)
[05:59:23] <Cork> phunkren_: the script tag should be before the first script that depends on it
[05:59:32] <phunkren_> Thanks Cork
[05:59:35] <phunkren_> That makes sense
[05:59:35] <Cork> and it should be in the html
[05:59:43] <phunkren_> Cheers mate
[06:00:10] <Cork> np
[06:11:57] <phunkren_> Out of interest Cork, is there any way I can add those libraries to my app.js?
[07:09:52] <realies> so I'm after making a play-out UI that has a playlist with media item rows and groups
[07:10:28] <realies> media items need to be drag&droppable, as well as groups
[07:10:51] <realies> dropping a media item on a group adds it to the group, moving it out does the obvious
[07:11:08] <realies> groups should also be drag&droppable
[07:11:16] <realies> any ideas for a smart library?
[07:11:45] <realies> found many of them that partially do those things, but nothing that would fully do what I'm after
[07:13:44] <realies> if I think about it now, it'd be cool selecting multiple items at once as well... almost like a DataGrid in WPF
[07:20:27] <mikesrike> How to get child with specific class of parent element of its another child?
[07:21:38] <mikesrike> I mean I have my div.parent and two divs inside, div.regular and div.hidden. I want to remove div.hidden if the div.regular is checked
[07:23:11] <kknight> i want to get old value reamin same in form , how to do that.?

[07:32:21] <kknight> anyone there
[07:33:16] <Cork> phunkren_: preprocessing and have the server merge the libs into one
[07:33:29] <Cork> phunkren_: or you could manually just add it at the beginning of the file
[07:33:50] <kknight> Cork: can you help me
[07:34:05] <Cork> kknight: what's the question?
[07:34:18] <kknight> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11052702/get-the-value-of-the-radio-button-that-was-selected-before-the-user-selects-a-ne
[07:34:24] <kknight> this is not working
[07:34:36] <kknight> after atrying on js fiddle,
[07:35:00] <kknight> I want to retain old value of my checked box after refreshing, how to do that?
[07:35:01] <Cork> mikesrike: is the hidden always after the .regular?
[07:35:40] <Cork> kknight: simplest solution would be to just push the value into indexedDB or localstorage
[07:35:51] <Cork> and then pull them back on load
[07:36:18] <kknight> Cork: explain it more , i am using in my rails app
[07:36:20] <kknight> please
[07:36:30] <kknight> how to do that?
[07:36:34] <Cork> rails doesn't really help you here
[07:36:40] <Cork> unless you submit the data to the server
[07:36:44] <kknight> yes its front end part
[07:36:57] <kknight> how to submit data to server
[07:37:11] <Cork> by making an ajax post or form post
[07:40:10] <kknight> Cork: can you please give some link
[07:40:19] <Cork> for what?
[07:41:05] <kknight> ajax post or form post
[07:41:57] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', data: $('form').serialize() })
[07:42:20] <Cork> but that won't really do much change unless you hook in the rest of what you need
[07:42:38] <kknight> please suggest in http://jsfiddle.net/BQDdJ/6/
[07:42:38] <Cork> and here is the link http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[07:42:49] <Cork> uh
[07:42:58] <Cork> i can't as the code you need to write will be server side
[07:50:15] <poptart_> I'm loading a page in an iframe in my chrome extension popup.html and I'd like to hide the sidebar when the page loads. so far I've had no success. here is the event listener from my popup.js file: http://pastebin.com/gCAfNbv3
[07:50:22] <poptart_> any help is appreciated
[07:51:29] <Cork> poptart_: you can't select cross documents
[07:51:50] <Cork> you could try $('iframe').contents().find("#sidebarCell").hide();
[07:52:00] <Cork> but if it is cross domain that won't work
[07:52:18] <Cork> (also you should prob as this in an extension development channel not here)
[07:56:30] <poptart_> Cork thanks, I'll try that.
[07:57:26] <silverdust> If I wanted to serialize content of a form when what I have is e.target not $(this) that can take a .serialize() method how do I go about it?
[07:58:00] <silverdust> Problem is I'm using an arrow function for callback and $(this) fails for how it handles its lexical this
[07:58:44] <Cork> silverdust: you need the input(s) element or the form
[07:58:50] <Cork> what variable you use doesn't matter
[07:58:58] <silverdust> I could specify the form selector again like $('#myform').serialize() but I thought I'd just get it from the click event
[07:59:16] <Cork> sure you can, but it would depend on what e.target is
[08:00:17] <silverdust> e.target is <form ..> as in a DOM node but $('#myform').serialize() is a query string
[08:00:26] <silverdust> with all inputs from the form
[08:01:00] <silverdust> when I try passing e.target to url parameter of a ajax request I get the following:
[08:04:38] <silverdust> First it freezes and does nothing then after some minutes: jquery.js:1449 Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[08:04:45] <silverdust> Cork: ^
[08:05:12] <Cork> too little to go on there
[08:05:18] <Cork> but your creating an infinite loop
[08:05:25] <Cork> that is what that error means
[08:06:07] <jose3_> howdy yall
[08:06:19] <silverdust> hi jose3_
[08:07:37] <silverdust> oops infinite loop just by passing ajax({data: e.target}). I guess I'll drop it then and go with $('#myformname').serialize()
[08:07:53] <Cork> silverdust: you can't send a dom element as ajax content
[08:08:02] <Cork> cause you can't convert a dom element to a string
[08:09:29] <silverdust> so the cosensus is that I use $('#formname'.serializer90
[08:09:45] <silverdust> missed my shift key there
[08:09:49] <Cork> no, the consensus is that your jumping to conclutions
[08:10:11] <Cork> you can base it on e.target, but you have to know what e.target is first
[08:10:29] <Cork> if e.target is a form or an input; sure
[08:10:31] <silverdust> e.target is the form node
[08:10:39] <Cork> node or element?
[08:11:12] <Cork> anyway you can do $(e.target).serialize() if it is the form or an input
[08:11:28] <silverdust> element I meant
[08:11:42] <silverdust> okay thanks. I'll try that
[08:22:51] <sigdk> hello. I have an html form that I use for 2 purposes. 1) To register a user 2) To modify a user . In the second case, I pass a hidden field with a uid to the backend upon submit. I use this plugin to validate the fields: https://jqueryvalidation.org/   Is there anything I can do to differentiate between the two cases upon validation ?  I want for instance when updating a user, to allow letting the password field empty but not at the case of registration
[08:47:54] <RedNifre> Hello, world.
[08:49:00] <RedNifre> I might be doing it wrong, but why do I get arrays in "done"? My code always looks like .when(ajax,ajax,ajax).done(function(a,b,c) { var realA = a[0]; var realB = b[0]... Is there a simpler way?
[08:50:04] <taplar_busy> i'm assuming your getting the array of arguments that are given to done, which is normal
[08:51:01] <RedNifre> But my ajax calls should return simple objects, not lists. Why is the response in an array?
[08:51:18] <taplar_busy> i just said why
[08:51:51] <taplar_busy> ajax callbacks, iirc, receive [ data, textStatus, jqXHR ]
[08:52:02] <taplar_busy> that is probably being given to the done()
[08:52:22] <taplar_busy> just cause you write a single ajax call normally only accepting in (data) does not mean the other two are not being provided
[08:52:30] <taplar_busy> your just ignoring them in that case
[08:52:45] <RedNifre> Ah, I understand. How important are textStatus and jqXHR? Is it okay to ignore them?
[08:52:56] <taplar_busy> if your not using them, ignore away, :)
[08:53:42] <RedNifre> Is there a simplified ".done" that only passes datas instead of the arrays?
[08:53:47] <taplar_busy> nope
[08:54:02] <taplar_busy> your getting the 'arguments' for each one
[08:54:40] <Uhkis> i bet you'd get those your/you'res correct more often if you'd just always use you're :D
[08:54:47] <taplar_busy> lol
[08:54:54] <taplar_busy> i love you Uhkis
[08:54:59] <RedNifre> What's the intended use for textStatus and jqXHR? What do you mean by "'arguments'"?
[08:55:03] <Uhkis> i love you too!
[08:55:22] <taplar_busy> "arguments" is a reserved word in javascript.  it is an array of all the inputs passed to a method
[08:55:24] <shoky_> even if there were no textStatus and jqXHR, you'd still get an array, of length 1
[08:55:26] <RedNifre> your funny
[08:55:29] <RedNifre> conversation amuses me.
[08:55:49] <taplar_busy> textStatus is like "success" or something like that iirc
[08:56:08] <Uhkis> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[08:56:10] <RedNifre> that's odd, I thought "success" was implied because .done was called instead of .fail
[08:56:17] <taplar_busy> jqXHR, someone else might be able to explain more, but its like the actual request object that was used... or something
[08:57:59] <taplar_busy> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[08:58:13] <RedNifre> Okay, am I doing something unusual or does everyone write code like .done(function(a,b,c) { var realA = a[0]; var realB = b[0] ... ?
[08:58:40] <taplar_busy> i don't usually write when() much so, *shrug*
[08:58:43] <shoky_> textStatus is only useful if you're using .always()
[08:58:54] <shoky_> (or 'complete')
[08:59:28] <RedNifre> So what do you people write when you want to do something with the result of 3 ajax calls?
[09:00:48] <taplar_busy> i can't speak to that.  i'm more of a one call at a time guy
[09:00:49] <shoky_> RedNifre i might do somethinglike:   .done(function() { var datas = Array.from(arguments).map(args => args[0]);  ... })
[09:01:20] <taplar_busy> i practice serial ajax monogamy, :D
[09:01:57] <Uhkis> taplar_busy: thenthenthenthen?
[09:02:03] <shoky_> (assuming all the ajax requests are of the same "type")
[09:02:24] <taplar_busy> in the 0.01 percent of the time i've had to do something like that, maybe
[09:02:30] <taplar_busy> i dunno
[09:02:46] <taplar_busy> i think one time i did something with an array of deferred and a when()
[09:03:07] <taplar_busy> but i wasn't really concerned with each of their response, just that they were all done
[09:03:24] <Uhkis> i've never had a usecase for that =(
[09:03:58] <jose3_> Hello there, I have this ajax call using jquery:  url: "findattendees.php", which works fine, however it loads the whole file. what if i just want to call a single function in that file ?
[09:04:10] <taplar_busy> i really don't remember what it was.  maybe it was my pub-sub plugin.  *goes to look at it*
[09:04:54] <shoky_> jose3_: send parameters in the request?
[09:05:09] <shoky_> and have your php react to them
[09:05:28] <taplar_busy> personally i'd open another endpoint
[09:05:32] <taplar_busy> instead of overloading it
[09:05:42] <shoky_> in any case, jquery/browser has no idea what php is or what functions you have there, they only care about the output of the request
[09:06:01] <jose3_> ok I see
[09:06:08] <shoky_> well, depends on their need/code, up to them
[09:06:12] <jose3_> Thanks
[09:07:02] <taplar_busy> optionally you could discriminate on request method
[09:07:19] <taplar_busy> more of a rest discussion there though
[09:09:42] <taplar_busy> small side note, i updated the color scheme on my crappy landing page, :D http://taplar.com/
[09:10:21] <shoky_> guarantees, sir
[09:10:27] <shoky_> otherwise, amazing
[09:10:34] <taplar_busy> crap, ty
[09:11:12] <z1haze_work> wouldn't $('form:not(.suppress)').each(function () { .... $(this).validate() ... { do the same thing as $('form:not(.suppress)').validate() ?
[09:11:44] <z1haze_work> from my understanding my second answer will validate all forms by that selector without having to each through, right?
[09:11:51] <Uhkis> taplar_busy: the word is guarantee! :D
[09:12:01] <shoky_> z1haze_work probably, but depends on how .validate() is written
[09:12:13] <taplar_busy> fixed!
[09:12:34] <Uhkis> and those colors are just pure sex, kudos!
[09:12:43] <z1haze_work> alright, its the jquery.validator stuff
[09:12:57] <taplar_busy> you guys joshin me or being serious?
[09:13:02] <z1haze_work> trying to look at code i didnt write and fix broken things
[09:13:05] <taplar_busy> lol, cause i'm terrible with ui
[09:13:13] <z1haze_work> clearly ^ lol
[09:13:37] <z1haze_work> taplar_busy: no shame though, thats why they have themeforest
[09:13:52] <Uhkis> taplar_busy: hey, it's not every bootstrap page ever, that's an actual compliment
[09:14:09] <Uhkis> taplar_busy: http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/
[09:14:34] <z1haze_work> haha
[09:14:36] <shoky_> z1haze_work: but looking at the docs and source code, no, calling .validate() will only process the first selected form
[09:14:44] <taplar_busy> ah, yeah, i don't really like those.  plus i kinda like the simple clean approach.  figure it'll play nicer on phones
[09:15:10] <shoky_> z1haze_work: the hint is in the wording:  "validate() – Validates the selected form"
[09:15:10] <z1haze_work> alright, well thank you for looking into that and checking, what did you read that told you that? i've been looking at these docs for days trying to fix what seems to be a small issue
[09:15:23] <shoky_> "the selected form" :)
[09:16:03] <shoky_> z1haze_work: and, https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/src/core.js#L15   you can see already at the start it does things with  this[0]  only on the first element
[09:16:13] <shoky_> and doesn't do a  this.each()
[09:16:47] <z1haze_work> im having an issue where we use a select plugin called selectric, it just says the select, hides it within a div, then creates its own select from divs so it can be styled, etc... the issue is that when we validate the form, the error classes and error messages are being applied to the hidden element
[09:16:58] <taplar_busy> lol, i feel like the maker of this website is really....... passionate about his view on that layout
[09:17:20] <Uhkis> taplar_busy: i think mine's prettier though http://uhkis.net/ (and a lot more of a cpu hog :D)
[09:17:46] <z1haze_work> taplar_busy: you dont have to use bootstrap, i dont use bootrap, or any framework for that matter, but i often model my sites off templates to get my inspiration
[09:17:50] <z1haze_work> im not super creative
[09:18:01] <z1haze_work> tympanus is a really good resource for inspiration
[09:18:26] <taplar_busy> Uhkis: i feel like i've seen that in a fiddle before, :)
[09:19:04] <Uhkis> taplar_busy: that's where i initially wrote it!
[09:19:25] <Uhkis> i have a habit of starting things on jsfiddle
[09:19:38] <shoky_> hah i like that bootstrap link Uhkis, my thoughts exactly :)
[09:20:32] <shoky_> though it's missing some parallax
[09:20:37] <taplar_busy> lol, the final sentence is golden
[09:21:10] <shoky_> heh
[09:21:13] <Uhkis> well, why else would it be so popular
[09:21:47] <taplar_busy> *shrug* someone did it for ipads/win10 pcs, then other companies emulated the new trend, :P
[09:22:31] <taplar_busy> probably the easiest implementation of a 'spa' too
[09:23:03] <shoky_> that ain't an spa ;p
[09:23:17] <shoky_> or are we talking about something else now
[09:23:33] <taplar_busy> it is a single page, ;).  but yeah, i did put it in quotes
[09:23:52] <shoky_> sp, then ;p
[09:23:55] <taplar_busy> heh
[09:24:05] <taplar_busy> "SP" doesn't sell to the MBAs man
[09:24:15] <Uhkis> oh it was an acronym :D
[09:24:28] <Uhkis> was a bit confused there for a moment
[09:24:34] <taplar_busy> ah, sorry
[09:25:18] <Serg_Penguin> hi ! is where a plugin to shim the HTML5 input[formaction] attribute ? failed to find on caniuse.com , failed to google up - all masked by general explanations what it is
[09:26:28] <taplar_busy> what is it?  like input type="submit" formaction="./dosomethingelse.php" ?
[09:27:20] <taplar_busy> i wasn't aware there were shims for stuff like that
[09:27:53] <taplar_busy> i mean you could probably write something that does a click handler to change the form and what not...
[09:29:25] <Serg_Penguin> taplar_busy, i hope it's a standalone input element, just made a checkbox - no POST on change (latest Chrome), so maybe i should do it myself anyway
[09:30:09] <taplar_busy> wait, huh?  you put formaction on a checkbox?
[09:31:25] <taplar_busy> according to MDN, formaction is a button attribute
[09:32:43] * taplar_busy throws only some matchbox 20 "i'm not crazy"
[09:33:39] <Serg_Penguin> huh, so i'm totally wrong with AJAX self-submitting inputs in HTML5 ? they don't exist ?
[09:33:58] <taplar_busy> no.... ?
[09:34:14] <taplar_busy> why would ajax be baked into html?
[09:34:32] <Uhkis> taplar_busy: because marketing department calls everything html5
[09:34:35] <Serg_Penguin> because everyone retrofits it
[09:34:47] <taplar_busy> Uhkis: heh
[09:35:17] <taplar_busy> people 'making html' do things, it's the default nature.  unless I'm completely out of the loop
[09:35:53] <taplar_busy> even angular with all it's ng-* stuff is just tags for javascript to do things to it.  the markup is still just markup
[09:36:21] <Uhkis> are you saying marketing department is wrong?!
[09:36:29] <taplar_busy> not to their faces
[09:37:47] <Serg_Penguin> hm, how harmful are $(document).on('change','input[formaction]',function(){}) ? or should I bind handlers exactly to elements, even if they are created by template render or HTML inclusion ?
[09:38:01] <taplar_busy> delegates are fine
[09:38:16] <shoky_> don't use that attribute for something it's not meant for, though
[09:38:23] <shoky_> use a class.
[09:39:00] <Uhkis> this is probably the first time i've ever seen someone using delegation by default, not asking about what it means :)
[09:39:11] <Serg_Penguin> ok, 'input[data-action]' ;) (what smiley is trollface?)
[09:39:12] <taplar_busy> progress, :)
[09:39:39] <shoky_> ;p
[09:40:24] <Uhkis> Serg_Penguin: if you ever find out, do tell! :D
[09:40:39] <Serg_Penguin> Uhkis, find out what ?
[09:41:04] <taplar_busy> how to loooooove
[09:41:04] <Uhkis> Serg_Penguin: the trollface smiley!
[09:41:06] <shoky_>  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ლ
[09:41:19] <Uhkis> lol taplar_busy
[09:42:43] <taplar_busy> shoky_: if that's not some preset, i'm amazed by your char map skillz
[09:43:26] <shoky_> heh, i've got a smilies.txt tucked away for these merry occasions
[09:44:11] <Tomatosoup1> do you consider loading to website all user's facebook friends in json reasonable ? i mean in way of performance - or should i make ajax call each time ?
[09:44:29] <taplar_busy> how many?
[09:44:38] <taplar_busy> your talking response size vs latency
[09:44:59] <Tomatosoup1> its about 500 friends - just names, no need for any other data
[09:45:15] <taplar_busy> eh, i'd think one would be fine
[09:45:35] <taplar_busy> but do some timing tests
[09:45:49] <Tomatosoup1> i will have search field where i would like to search friends by names
[09:46:05] <Tomatosoup1> maybe it would be better to make separate ajax call on each search ?
[09:46:09] <Tomatosoup1> via GET
[09:46:17] <taplar_busy> ah, so your asking if you should preload and filter or do a search each time
[09:46:51] <Tomatosoup1> sorry for not precising - yes, i want to have search box
[09:47:32] <taplar_busy> one search would be better performance wise.  and if its just names, shouldn't be much of a memory hit
[09:48:07] <Tomatosoup1> premature optimization is root of all evil ;) i guess i will take a look how long does it take, and then reconsider it
[09:48:10] <taplar_busy> how accurate do you want it to be though?  do you care about the edge case that a new friend gets added during the process?
[09:48:19] <Tomatosoup1> no, i dont
[09:48:25] <taplar_busy> so cool
[09:49:24] <taplar_busy> and i don't really consider this premature optimization.  this is more of a architecture discussion, which should always be considered
[09:50:11] <Tomatosoup1> thats why i ask here. do you have any fancy facebook-alike searchbox with fancy dropdown of choices ?
[09:50:26] <Tomatosoup1> *do you have any plugin to
[09:50:39] <taplar_busy> uh, checkout bootstrap.  surely they have something
[09:50:45] <Tomatosoup1> ok, thanks
[09:51:28] <taplar_busy> oh snap.  The Calling.  haven't heard them in years
[09:51:51] <z1haze_work> anyone know how to change the element that gets the 'error' class for jquery validator?
[09:52:16] <z1haze_work> i have figured out the error placement for my selectric boxes, but the error class is still being applied to the select, i need to move it up to the parent
[09:52:47] <Tomatosoup1> one more question if you dont mind. do you think that jquery is enough to consume rather basic REST API or should i move to MVC framework, like backbone.js ?
[09:53:05] <taplar_busy> what is your need?
[09:53:42] <taplar_busy> if all your after is the ability to make ajax requests, a full blown mvc framework is a bit of an overkill
[09:54:35] <taplar_busy> iirc jquery ajax works with get, post, put, delete.  haven't personally used the other methods
[09:55:11] <Tomatosoup1> so far only basic json GETs from URLs but this project might grow to something bigger, thats why i consider taking mature mvc framework
[09:55:25] <Tomatosoup1> well, gets, posts and puts
[09:56:00] <taplar_busy> if you foresee that your frontend can/will grow into a larger project, sure, consider an mvc
[09:56:19] <taplar_busy> look at that Uhkis, i did 'an' mvc
[09:56:27] <taplar_busy> *tear* i'm growin
[09:57:20] <Uhkis> not sure if i should point out the wrong yours now
[09:57:39] <taplar_busy> ^_^
[09:59:42] <taplar_busy> Tomatosoup1: do you work on multiple projects, or only this one?  or is this like a freelance thing?
[09:59:48] <taplar_busy> brb, got standup
[10:01:20] <Uhkis> TIL: taplar_busy does standup :D
[10:04:15] <Tomatosoup1> taplar_busy: actually, this is off-work, my own project ;) i work mainly as backend dev, sometimes as fullstack but im not-so-good in js
[10:11:03] <printForever> I'm going nuts over this...
[10:11:09] <printForever> .each and .append
[10:11:18] <printForever> it keeps appending all in one place
[10:15:42] <taplar_busy> TIL?
[10:16:18] <taplar_busy> Tomatosoup1: that's cool.  i was going to say another thing to consider with is if you're working with multiple projects, an mvc can also bring some consistency to all of them and help teams out
[10:17:07] <taplar_busy> printForever: show what your doing yo
[10:17:29] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/5zysz8oq/2/
[10:18:04] <printForever> my reasoning was that he would go through each .work div and append text to .hellome
[10:18:20] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/5zysz8oq/3/
[10:18:45] <taplar_busy> what is 'vwo_'
[10:18:59] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/5zysz8oq/5/
[10:19:11] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/5zysz8oq/6/
[10:19:17] <printForever> WTF!
[10:19:19] <printForever> ITS WORKING NOW
[10:19:21] <printForever> why?!
[10:19:39] <taplar_busy> what's the problem?
[10:19:59] <printForever> on my actual code example it just populates the last div
[10:20:01] <printForever> 3x
[10:20:25] <printForever> but in fiddle it works as I thought it should
[10:20:38] <taplar_busy> ah, *shrug*
[10:20:43] <printForever> tnx
[10:33:02] <Tomatosoup1> taplar_busy: what is your personal preference on mvc framework ?
[10:33:35] <taplar_busy> i don't have any extensive experience with them, though we use angular in our shop now
[10:34:06] <taplar_busy> from what i hear from those guys, it's cut back on the size of their code base drastically
[10:41:00] <printForever> taplar_busy, can I use EACH in EACH?
[10:41:11] <taplar_busy> sure
[10:41:29] <printForever> tnx
[10:42:29] <taplar_busy> if you have a jQuery object, you can you any jquery method off of it.  there's not really any restriction i can think of in those regards
[10:43:20] <printForever> I'm having issues with updating
[10:43:53] <taplar_busy> watcha got?
[10:45:11] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/5zysz8oq/8/
[10:45:23] <printForever> I need to get these P values into the divs
[10:45:29] <printForever> every time I try
[10:45:38] <printForever> I get the first div filled with 3
[10:45:41] <printForever> or the last filled with 3
[10:45:55] <printForever> I was trying to separate them with each
[10:45:56] <printForever> but...
[10:47:35] <taplar_busy> collect is a class
[10:47:51] <taplar_busy> and p tags don't have values, they have html() or text()
[10:48:02] <printForever> it was just an example
[10:48:06] <printForever> as a class?
[10:48:12] <printForever> yes. collect is a class
[10:48:17] <taplar_busy> https://jsfiddle.net/5zysz8oq/9/
[10:48:32] <printForever> yes, they are trippled
[10:48:41] <taplar_busy> sure
[10:48:42] <printForever> I wanted to fill each div only once
[10:48:49] <taplar_busy> so scope your lookup down
[10:49:02] <taplar_busy> $(".hellome") is a global lookup
[10:49:10] <printForever> I don't understand the terminology
[10:49:25] <printForever> oh I get it
[10:49:36] <printForever> but I could also check if the div is empty or not, right?
[10:49:44] <printForever> if empty, skip
[10:49:46] <taplar_busy> just scope down dude
[10:49:57] <printForever> how? :(
[10:50:18] <taplar_busy> 'this' in the each is the 'work' element your currently on
[10:50:26] <taplar_busy> you can $(this).find(...)
[10:50:28] <geoff_> So I am trying to find a label of a checkbox; but the ID of the checkbox has a colon in it;  using $('label[for=' + escapedId + ']'); is not working
[10:50:48] <taplar_busy> geoff_: surround your value with ""
[10:51:14] <printForever> taplar_busy, but I would still get 3 texts
[10:51:14] <Twirl> hey guys, how do you select the next item on a list ? or how can you get the current position? as in <li></li><li>u got this selected</li> how do you know it's index 1 and how can you select the previous or next one from it?
[10:51:28] <taplar_busy> printForever: have you tried it yet?
[10:51:33] <printForever> I'm writing it
[10:51:53] <taplar_busy> so your assuming i'm lieing to you, :)
[10:52:14] <printForever> I just dont understand what find() has to do with it
[10:52:22] <printForever> what am I searching for?
[10:52:30] <taplar_busy> '.hellome'
[10:52:38] <printForever> but I already know its...
[10:52:42] <taplar_busy> your looking for the hellome that belongs to that work
[10:52:50] <Twirl> I have the 3'd item selected because it has 'active' class, now i have to get the previous one in a list of n items
[10:52:59] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/5zysz8oq/10/
[10:53:23] * printForever gets a glass of Retarrrd CoolAid
[10:53:59] <geoff_> taplar_busy: thanks.  didn't even need to escape it when doing it that way
[10:54:29] <taplar_busy> geoff_: yup, always good practice to do that ("" that is)
[10:54:31] <printForever> taplar_busy, thank you
[10:54:50] * taplar_busy really has to do some local work.  *wanders away*
[10:56:50] <Twirl> if i select the parent i get the whole list of n items, maybe i can use that?
[10:58:32] <Twirl> .index() isn't doing anything
[10:58:35] <Twirl> it's returning 0
[11:08:06] <Twirl> nvm
[11:13:51] <joaocastanho> $(this).closest(".popup").find("[data-action]");
[11:13:54] <joaocastanho> Can I do this?
[11:14:07] <joaocastanho> on Alert() it gives me Object Object
[11:31:07] <shoky_> joaocastanho: yes you can do that.  don't use alert though, use console.log and look in your browser's console
[11:31:27] <joaocastanho> it doesnt return the value though
[11:31:29] <shoky_> and you'll see some representation of a jquery object
[11:31:32] <joaocastanho> But I went through other path
[11:31:54] <joaocastanho> yeah, it returns a jquery object
[11:32:35] <shoky_> that line alone doesn't do anything btw.. assuming you have something chained on the end there, or it's stored in a variable
[11:33:18] <joaocastanho> I wanted to get data-action value
[11:34:37] <shoky_> .attr is for getting attribute values
[11:34:56] <shoky_> or you can use .data also for data-* attributes
[11:42:20] <joaocastanho> ok, I'll try :)
[11:44:47] <joaocastanho> shoky_ can you help with another problem?
[11:45:08] <z1haze_work> anyone know if the jquery validator method errorPlacement  is executed each time a form is validated?
[11:45:18] <joaocastanho> shoky_ http://kopy.io/PRUQO
[11:45:46] <joaocastanho> I have input class="checkbox_house" in several modals, but I just want this to happen in the opened modal
[11:46:49] <z1haze_work> i have this for my errorPlacement because i have a select plugin that restyles select boxes into divs and ul's etc.. it seems to work adding the error class to the .selectric class the first time you submit the form, but afterward doesnt add the error class back, and im not sure why
[11:47:06] <z1haze_work> the error span does still toggle, just the error class on .selectric doesnt add back
[11:47:35] <joaocastanho> shoky_ Got it :P
[11:51:29] <anotheryou_> Hi. I want to clone an object and than at a class for a transition animation. How do I set the initial values for the browser to register before I add a class with the final values for the animation?
[11:51:37] <anotheryou_> ~add a class
[11:52:24] <riccoski> anotheryou_:  what values?
[11:52:33] <anotheryou_> just some CSS
[11:52:42] <anotheryou_> I clone and than change the position
[11:53:05] <anotheryou_> and whant a nice CSS transition
[11:53:58] <riccoski> anotheryou_:  you can do that via css animations depending whether you need to support ie 8
[11:54:18] <anotheryou_> riccoski, yes, IE is no concern :)
[11:54:38] <anotheryou_> I'm not sure how to keep track of my cloned object. maybe it's enough to add an "animate" class in a second js command
[11:55:27] <anotheryou_> for now i did $element.clone().appendTo('body').addClass('basicStyling').addClass('targetState');
[11:55:41] <riccoski> anotheryou_:  thats all you need
[11:56:30] <anotheryou_> riccoski, but now it doesn't register the CSS values of the first class
[11:56:50] <anotheryou_> basicStyling sets position to the startposition
[11:57:01] <anotheryou_> targetState sets the same position values to the final position
[11:57:19] <anotheryou_> und CSS transitions would do the rest, if they ever saw the startposition :)
[11:57:34] <riccoski> anotheryou_: you should do that with css animations instead
[11:57:38] <riccoski> you can set keyframes
[11:57:50] <anotheryou_> ah, keyframe instead, makes sense... thanks!
[11:58:27] <anotheryou_> is there some callback for a finished animation? I fade something out, would be nice to remove it from the DOM without a hardcoded delay
[11:59:46] <shoky_> there's an animationend event
[11:59:54] <anotheryou_> thanks
[13:16:04] <Xatenev> Heya
[13:16:15] <Xatenev> Im trying to check if a file exists with $.get(url).done(function()...
[13:16:26] <Xatenev>  but my script is interrupted when I get as return GET url 403 (Forbidden)
[13:16:33] <Xatenev> try { } catch doesnt seem to work.
[13:16:35] <Xatenev> Any ideas on that ?
[13:16:37] <Xatenev> How can I catch that shit?
[13:19:27] <taplar_busy> 403 would fall into the fail() or always() category
[13:48:54] <relipse> I am trying to create a shopping cart using javascript primarily the idea is, the user can click "add to cart", which will do an ajax call to the server, and the server will return the shopping cart list of items and prices and client will pop up a shopping cart div with the items listed. I was wondering what is the best way to handle the display of the products and prices and total amount?
[14:04:38] <taplar_busy> relipse: kinda up to you.  with a modal you could go either with one that can toggle visibly (various websites) or some that appears some where on the screen for review (like dominos)
[14:04:55] <taplar_busy> or have a summary page all on its own
[16:32:07] <compact> http://pastebin.com/zfu5Wu6X <-- any idea why the 1st block will fade out, but if i change where it fades out, it doesn't?
[16:33:59] <SpecialTech> becuase you're still trying to evoke $(this) rather than using the var you set up earlier? Hard to tell w/o a fiddle lol
[16:51:40] <compact> SpecialTech, be hard because of the post url?
[16:56:27] <compact> ok fixed it
[16:56:35] <compact> var $tr = $(this).closest('tr');
[16:56:42] <compact> and then $tr.closest("tr").fadeOut(500);
[17:21:14] <arc_> hm i wonder where robertmaxrees went
[17:21:32] <arc_> maybe he's on vacation or something
[17:58:03] <elillu> :D
[18:04:31] <vx1> in this example https://jsfiddle.net/La750kfp/6/ if you type something in the input and move mouse out it changes the text, but you cant do it again, why is that? also how can i add a ::before style to the .change class
[22:44:11] <poptart_> hello, is anyone here? i have question about injecting jquery into a page using a content script. I'd take this to the chromium extension channel but it doesnt seem like anyone is there
