[00:00:53] <aro> so use a callback
[00:57:34] <Helloooo1> hey
[00:57:48] <Uhkis> hi
[00:58:01] <Helloooo1> i'm trying to click html element that is opened (i think) by flash object
[00:58:30] <Helloooo1> i can select him on chrome console and find his classname, but i can't locate him!!!
[00:58:41] <Helloooo1> i mean i can't "catch" him
[00:58:58] <Helloooo1> any idea?
[00:59:37] <Uhkis> no idea what do you mean
[01:13:48] <Uhkis> Helloooo1: what do you mean by "catch" ?
[01:15:35] <Helloooo1> when i see the the code it's written for example : class="blabla"
[01:16:18] <Helloooo1> and when i try to do: tempObj = $(".blabla")
[01:16:25] <Helloooo1> it doesn't find the element
[01:16:32] <Helloooo1> but just a sec i think i found the problem
[01:18:20] <Uhkis> you need delegation, implementation depends on what you're actually trying to do
[01:18:55] <Helloooo1> mmm. i don't get it
[01:19:35] <Helloooo1> i'm working on existing code
[01:20:01] <Helloooo1> i see i won't fix it today, i'm going to sleep....thing will be better after good sleep!!! lol
[01:20:09] <Helloooo1> thank you, bye bye
[01:20:13] <Uhkis> good night :)
[04:23:19] <joaocastanho> jquery.js:7373 Uncaught InvalidStateError: Failed to set the 'value' property on 'HTMLInputElement': This input element accepts a filename, which may only be programmatically set to the empty string.
[04:23:26] <joaocastanho> Hello. What does this mean?
[04:23:49] <Cork> sounds like you're trying to set a file picker
[04:24:13] <Cork> (something you can't do)
[04:25:01] <joaocastanho> $(document).on('change', ':file', function() { });
[04:25:03] <joaocastanho> this ?
[04:25:13] <Cork> no
[04:25:27] <Cork> you're prob doing something like $(this).val(something)
[04:26:08] <joaocastanho> http://kopy.io/OiKGv
[04:26:20] <Duikb00t> o/
[04:26:31] <joaocastanho> Here Duikb00t? :)
[04:26:37] <Duikb00t> o/
[04:26:41] <joaocastanho> o/
[04:26:52] <Duikb00t> o/ Cork
[04:26:59] <Cork> joaocastanho: what version of jquery are you using?
[04:27:09] <joaocastanho> 2.1.3
[04:27:14] <Duikb00t> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37586104/reveal-js-structure-of-slides   omg has someone an idea how I can start solving this im struggling with this now for more then a week.
[04:28:05] <Cork> joaocastanho: ok, set a breakpoint at line 7373 in jquery.js and check the stack where the error comes from (in your code)
[04:28:28] <Cork> cause somewhere you're calling .val with a value
[04:28:32] <Cork> and file doesn't support this
[04:28:58] <Cork> well it did way WAY back in the days but not in a long time
[04:29:12] <joaocastanho> cork this is what is in 7373
[04:29:12] <joaocastanho>    if ( !hooks || !("set" in hooks) || hooks.set( this, val, "value" ) === undefined ) {
[04:29:12] <joaocastanho>     this.value = val;
[04:29:12] <joaocastanho>    }
[04:29:23] <Cork> joeytwiddle: a breakpoint there ya
[04:29:31] <Cork> and look at the stack where in your code your calling it from
[04:29:55] <joaocastanho> so what you mean by breakpoint?
[04:30:00] <Cork> prob somwhere in readFile or button
[04:30:04] <Cork> uh
[04:30:21] <Cork> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint
[04:31:03] <Duikb00t> Cork:  Can I cry on your shoulder?
[04:32:43] <joaocastanho> cork something strange in here, I have included jquery.min.js
[04:32:54] <joaocastanho> and it's returning error in jquery.js
[04:32:58] <Cork> joaocastanho: you need to use the unminified version
[04:32:58] <joaocastanho> and I can't find it
[04:33:09] <Cork> else it is just one gigantic mess
[04:34:09] <joaocastanho> but why does it say it is in jquery.js, I have the minified one
[04:34:28] <Cork> joaocastanho: most likely cause your browser loads the source map
[04:34:45] <joaocastanho> so nothing wrong?
[04:34:51] <Cork> eh...
[04:35:00] <Cork> joaocastanho: the problem is in your code
[04:35:24] <Cork> joaocastanho: the break point is so you can find where as you apparently don't know where you try to set the value on the file input
[04:37:34] <joaocastanho> but it's working, is just that error
[04:38:00] <Cork> well except from where that exception is thrown nothing after it will run
[04:38:25] <Cork> the js stack will unwind from there and skip the rest of the code
[04:49:37] <daslicht> anyone knows a jquery image carousel or Marquee which lets you have multiple image sizes , images centered vertically and full responsive ?
[04:49:46] <daslicht> which moves linear like a news ticker
[04:50:00] <joaocastanho> Cork I didn't tried what you said yet
[04:50:04] <joaocastanho> I know the problem is here
[04:50:06] <joaocastanho> $(document).on('change', ':file', function() {
[04:50:15] <Cork> joaocastanho: no it isn't
[04:50:20] <joaocastanho> If I change :file to #upload or something no error thrown
[04:50:33] <Cork> ya, cause you don't run the code of the file anymore
[04:50:45] <joaocastanho> it doesn't exist in 2.1.3?
[04:50:52] <Cork> uh
[04:51:01] <Cork> read the comments again
[04:51:21] <Cork> your staring at the wrong place
[04:52:03] <joaocastanho> I should be staring at jquery.js?
[04:52:16] <Cork> such...
[04:52:20] <Cork> i've already answered this...
[04:52:32] <joaocastanho> I know
[04:52:40] <Cork> as you don't know where your doing .val(something) on the input type="file"
[04:52:56] <Cork> you can find this by setting a breakpoint at line 7373 in jquery.js
[04:53:07] <Cork> then look at the stack to find where this was called from
[04:53:24] <Cork> alternatively you can read through the code you run and find in manually
[04:53:43] <Cork> (but you don't need to read through jquery.js it isn't the cause of the problem)
[04:55:31] <joaocastanho> cork I did console.log(val);
[04:55:39] <joaocastanho> this was returned "loading..."
[04:55:41] <Cork> uh, what?
[04:56:27] <joaocastanho> I did it wrong?
[04:56:27] <Cork> joaocastanho: please look into how to find the stack or at least provide a working jsfiddle so someone else can do it
[04:56:36] <Cork> not even sure what you did
[04:56:41] <Cork> it wasn't even close to what i asked for
[04:56:55] <joaocastanho> sorry
[04:56:58] <joaocastanho> let me grab jsfiddle
[05:03:25] <joaocastanho> cork https://jsfiddle.net/hajjh9s0/1/
[05:08:53] <Cork> joaocastanho: http://i.imgur.com/oqToqjE.png
[05:09:13] <Cork> the darker line these is from the Button plugin in bootstrap
[05:09:22] <Cork> so you can't call .button on a file input
[05:09:35] <Cork> you have to use a different element for the styling
[05:10:00] <joaocastanho> this line? $this.button('loading');
[05:10:28] <Cork> donno they obfuscate it though timers and proxies
[05:10:39] <joaocastanho> ah right
[05:10:39] <Cork> but any of them is most likely the problem
[05:11:16] <Cork> the simplest solution is to just use <button type="button">Upload file</button><input type="file" id="picker" style="display: none">
[05:11:47] <Cork> and in js do $('button').on('click', function() { $('#picker')[0].click(); })
[05:11:49] <joaocastanho> but I want to customize it :P
[05:12:00] <Cork> well that lets you do so
[05:12:09] <Cork> though you don't need that plugin to do it
[05:12:22] <Cork> just those two lines and css would do
[05:13:56] <joaocastanho> if I could use bootstrap.js internal functions would be good
[05:14:01] <joaocastanho> its easier
[05:14:07] <joaocastanho> could this be reported as a bug?
[05:14:17] <Cork> not really
[05:14:27] <Cork> at least i wouldn't see it as one
[05:14:38] <joaocastanho> it's my fault?
[05:14:43] <Cork> i wouldn't expect $('iframe').button('something') to work either
[05:15:02] <joaocastanho> right, I get the logic
[05:18:56] <joaocastanho> <button type="button" id="upload" class="btn btn-success btn-file btn-lg btn-block"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span>&nbsp;<span class="upload">Load File <input type="file" id="picker" style="display: none;"></span></button>
[05:19:05] <joaocastanho> Can I do it like this Cork?
[05:19:27] <Cork> if you like ; sure
[05:19:35] <Cork> don't forget to add the needed js though
[05:19:54] <joaocastanho> yeah
[05:37:14] <joaocastanho> should this work $('#upload').val("<i class='icon icon-spin icon-spinner'></i> A Carregar..."); Cork?
[05:37:29] <Cork> no
[05:37:38] <Cork> $('#upload').html()
[05:37:53] <joaocastanho> val() for inputs and textareas?
[05:38:02] <Cork> .val() is for form fields
[05:38:13] <joaocastanho> yeah, right. :)
[05:38:14] <joaocastanho> thanks
[05:38:15] <Cork> so input, select, textarea
[05:39:18] <joaocastanho> how do I block my button like bootstrap does on itself?
[05:39:24] <joaocastanho> disabled?
[05:39:26] <Cork> ya
[05:39:36] <joaocastanho> an attribute?
[05:39:37] <Cork> you can style the look for disabled if you want
[05:39:39] <Cork> yes
[05:39:41] <joaocastanho> okay
[05:39:46] <Cork> well
[05:39:55] <joaocastanho> it looks better disabled
[05:40:00] <Cork> if you call through jquery you use $('#upload'
[05:40:02] <Cork> opps
[05:40:10] <Cork> if you call through jquery you use $('#upload').prop('disabled', true)
[05:41:25] <joaocastanho> it looks awesome :)
[05:41:40] <joaocastanho> I did the same but with jQuery xD
[05:47:33] <yabbah> I have a input for username, which I set ".prop('disabled', true);" when I have choosen a username. How can I check on the "save"-button that the property of that field is disabled?
[05:47:51] <yabbah> tried: if (!($('.username').is(':disabled'))) {
[05:47:51] <yabbah>  			console.log('LKDJFD');
[05:47:56] <yabbah>  }
[05:48:05] <yabbah> ops, but that didnt work.
[05:48:07] <Cork> yabbah: i would recommend reverting that
[05:48:18] <Cork> have the button disabled on load
[05:48:40] <Cork> when the user is changed use .prop('readonly', true) $('#submit').prop('disabled', false)
[05:48:58] <Cork> and then you don't need any checks on the submit button
[05:49:23] <yabbah> but the submit-button check alots of other fields too :)
[05:49:23] <Cork> (btw you should bind the save event on submit of the form, not click of the button)
[05:54:08] <daslicht> why does line 26 break teh carousel ? https://plnkr.co/edit/IPRMkHEF24qrtnX0JLOa?p=preview
[05:56:24] <Cork> yabbah: https://jsfiddle.net/ns7uck7u/1/
[05:56:48] <Cork> yabbah: the reason you should use readonly instead of disabled
[05:56:59] <Cork> is cause disabled is not included in form submissions
[05:58:59] <yabbah> Cork: Thanks :)
[06:13:10] <sonuk_> i am facing wired issue with my script . i am simply sending ajax to save data on server. when success returning my custom msg is coming but with this "This page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved."
[06:35:54] <daslicht> is there a way to work with vw and vh in jquery ?
[06:36:14] <daslicht> for example how to get the height of an element in vh ?
[06:36:36] <rollingWolf> daslicht, Just divide
[06:37:01] <jradpet> It seems that there is problem in $().show() under firefox while the parent is with display:none
[06:37:07] <rollingWolf> daslicht, its a matter of simple math
[06:37:32] <sonuk_>  here is my query " i am facing wired issue with my script . i am simply sending ajax to save data on server. when success returning my custom msg is coming but with this "This page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved." "
[06:37:49] <rollingWolf> daslicht, (element.height / window.height) * 100 = X% vh
[06:37:55] <sonuk_> i am using window.location.url = "my page" to redirect after success in ajax
[06:37:57] <rollingWolf> daslicht, Or something
[06:38:21] <daslicht> yeah ok I play a lil bit around with it
[06:38:23] <daslicht> :D
[06:38:25] <daslicht> thanks
[06:39:46] <jradpet> can i workaround $().show({effect...}) with manually calling the css.('display','block') and animation
[06:40:34] <daslicht> anyone sees why line 26 breaks the code : https://plnkr.co/edit/7DsQZ6xagVfUObR61vlb?p=preview
[06:40:51] <daslicht> as far as i disaple flex the carousel stops working
[06:41:16] <daslicht> I just try to center it vertically
[06:44:40] <sonuk_> hi i am using  i am using window.location.href= "my page" to redirect after success in ajax . but it is giving me alert leave page or stay here then redirect...
[06:44:47] <sonuk_> how to remove this alert
[06:45:29] <rollingWolf> sonuk_, Not sure but i think its because you have some input or something that focused, or text in a field not submitted
[06:46:04] <rollingWolf> I stumble accross that alert every now and then on various pages without reflecting on why
[06:46:07] <sonuk_> rollingWolf: ok its clue.. i am checking ..
[06:47:53] <joaocastanho> this is sort of bugged https://jsfiddle.net/5ygyett9/
[06:55:49] <joaocastanho> Cork: I made it working but the spin from bootstrap always start from beginning when adding the dot (.)
[07:10:52] <yabbah> How do I remove the last element of an class with jquery?
[07:14:13] <Cork> yabbah: last element found or last child?
[07:14:52] <Cork> $('selector:last-child).remove() or $('selector').last().remove()
[07:15:06] <Cork> the first one is preferable if you can use it
[07:17:36] <yabbah> Cork: I add new instances of row_template with "$('#row_template').clone().show().prependTo($('.wrapper'));", so I tried remove the last one with "$('#row_template:last-child').remove();" .. But it wont work.
[07:18:03] <yabbah> No, I add new instances with "$('#row_template').clone().insertBefore('.removeItem');"
[07:18:18] <Cork> yabbah: you can't use an id to select multiple elements
[07:18:23] <yabbah> "removeItem" is a button
[07:18:27] <Cork> you're html is broken
[07:19:09] <Cork> what you should do is $('#row_template').clone().removeAttr('id').addClass('something').insertBefore()
[07:19:11] <yabbah> Cork: But everything works fine beside the "remove last element" button :)
[07:19:18] <Cork> ya, cause you don't try to use the id
[07:19:27] <Cork> the id can ever only exist on one element
[07:19:32] <yabbah> Cork: I try that one :)
[07:19:39] <Cork> so the selector you're trying to use will only remove the template
[07:19:44] * hellyeah i need to blow off some steam. Any suggestion?
[07:20:04] <hellyeah> ops
[07:20:07] <hellyeah> wrong channek
[07:20:11] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[07:21:27] <joaocastanho> Cork: how to get value of $('#picker')[0];
[07:21:40] <Cork> you don't
[07:21:43] <Cork> you get files
[07:21:51] <joaocastanho> I need to pass it to readfile(this)
[07:21:53] <Cork> $('#picker').prop('files')
[07:23:23] <joaocastanho> what does that return?
[07:23:42] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/File
[07:24:03] <Cork> rather it returns a https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList
[07:24:30] <joaocastanho> the other way was easy but returning error
[07:24:31] <joaocastanho> var $this = $(this);
[07:24:35] <joaocastanho> just had to do this
[07:25:43] <joaocastanho> current code: http://kopy.io/gpcLy
[07:25:57] <Cork> joaocastanho: i can't tell you what you need to do
[07:26:04] <Cork> cause i don't know what readfile takes
[07:26:33] <Cork> but ya, if it has built in support for grabbing files from the input field just give it $(this)
[07:26:44] <yabbah> Cork: Now I add the first initial instance with "$('#row_template').clone().show().removeAttr('row_template').addClass('row_template').prependTo($('.wrapper'));", and when press the button "add another one" I run "$('#row_template').clone().removeAttr('row_template').addClass('row_template').insertBefore('.removeItem');", where removeItem is the button that will remove the last element. But "$('.row_template:last-child').remove();" wont re
[07:26:49] <Cork> but ya, what you need to do depends on what the function expects
[07:27:06] <Cork> yabbah: you remove name not the value
[07:27:20] <Cork> yabbah: row_template won't do anything
[07:28:14] <joaocastanho> http://kopy.io/mg2Kj Cork
[07:28:33] <yabbah> Cork: hmm, what shall I write then? :O
[07:28:42] <Cork> joaocastanho: readFile(input) <--
[07:28:47] <Cork> so just give it this
[07:28:59] <Cork> yabbah: i have you the code you should run
[07:29:24] <joaocastanho> and in here? if (input.files !== undefined && input.files[0] !== undefined) {
[07:29:29] <joaocastanho> 'this' too ?
[07:29:39] <Cork> you don't need to modify that function at all
[07:30:02] <joaocastanho> then how?
[07:30:21] <Cork> ah, sorry now i understand what you're on about
[07:30:30] <joaocastanho> :)
[07:30:43] <Cork> joaocastanho: the click event should be bound on the input field not the button
[07:31:05] <Cork> the button should be what you style and it should in turn just trigger click on the file input
[07:31:09] <Cork> the rest should work as before
[07:31:42] <joaocastanho> just like that?
[07:31:43] <joaocastanho> $('#picker_mudar_foto').on('click', function() {
[07:33:15] <joaocastanho> am I close cork?
[07:33:59] <Cork> i don't even know what you're asking there
[07:34:21] <joaocastanho> joaocastanho: the click event should be bound on the input field not the button
[07:34:48] <yabbah> Cork, I had fucked the removeAttr :P Works now, thanks !!
[07:35:23] <Cork> joaocastanho: extreamly hacky example of what you should do https://jsfiddle.net/m6yfxz9p/
[07:37:57] <Patte> what am i doing here?
[07:38:09] <Patte> document.querySelectorAll() !!!
[07:38:14] <Patte> why still using jquery?
[07:38:22] <Patte> whats the purpose in 2016?
[07:38:26] <Patte>  / part
[07:38:37] <Cork> heh...
[07:40:36] <phrearch> hello
[07:40:56] <phrearch> i was wondering whether $(e.currentTarget) is the same as $(this) within the scope of an event
[07:41:04] <Cork> no
[07:41:17] <phrearch> rewriting some code with arrow functions, but i want to be careful with this :)
[07:41:27] <phrearch> Cork: good to know, has to do with bubbling?
[07:41:51] <Cork> ah, sorry
[07:41:54] <Cork> i was wrong
[07:42:03] <Cork> it is the same, but i don't think all browsers support it
[07:42:12] <Cork> and i don't think jquery exposes it
[07:42:48] <phrearch> hm, as long ie9 supports it, i don't mind :)
[07:42:52] <Cork> phrearch: and ya, that is the big problem with arrow functions, no way to access this elements
[07:43:31] <phrearch> $(e.currentTarget) is probably fine then. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget only warns about ie 6-8
[07:43:52] <Cork> give me a min
[07:44:11] <phrearch> ok thanks
[07:45:06] <joaocastanho> ah cork, your code wasn't working because I had input file inside button
[07:45:08] <Cork> iiinteresting
[07:45:35] <Cork> phrearch: ya, it works fine, wonder when jquery started exposing currentTarget in there event object
[07:45:46] <Cork> have totally missed that one
[07:45:57] <Cork> joaocastanho: doesn't matter
[07:46:19] <phrearch> Cork: as far as i know, it's there for a long time
[07:46:32] <Cork> joaocastanho: https://jsfiddle.net/m6yfxz9p/1/
[07:46:34] <joaocastanho> but it wasn't Cork. so something was wrong
[07:46:40] <Cork> i prefer to not nest those, but it works fine
[07:46:56] <Cork> joaocastanho: ya, so find why
[07:47:01] <phrearch> nice i can remove all _this/that references
[07:47:05] <Cork> don't randomly accuse parts of the code...
[07:47:27] <Cork> phrearch: and thanks, this has been one of my big complaints with arrow functions
[07:47:37] <Cork> it solves a major problem with it for me
[07:47:57] <Cork> though i still think they need a way for arrow function to access this...
[07:48:24] <Cork> (ex. tac it on the ends of the attribute list)
[07:48:27] <joaocastanho> is this okay readFile(this.files[0].name); Cork?
[07:48:34] <Cork> ...no
[07:48:35] <joaocastanho> it doesn't seem to be working
[07:48:41] <joaocastanho> oh right
[07:48:43] <joaocastanho> so it's not :P
[07:48:47] <Cork> joaocastanho: more reading, more understanding and less copy pasting
[07:49:03] <Cork> i've told you exactly what you should give it several times now...
[07:49:10] <joaocastanho> this
[07:49:15] <phrearch> Cork: yeah, np :D
[07:49:21] <Cork> joaocastanho: so scroll up and read it again
[07:50:04] <joaocastanho> cool :)
[07:50:05] <joaocastanho> worked
[07:50:06] <joaocastanho> ;)
[07:50:47] <joaocastanho> thanks a lot Cork. Sorry for being dumb xD
[07:53:22] <emilkarl> Is it possible to get list of child elements that matches as certiain offsetX?
[07:53:35] <Cork> emilkarl: not without looping
[07:53:49] <Cork> you could get an element by page position though
[07:54:27] <Cork> emilkarl: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/elementFromPoint
[07:54:59] <Cork> just remember that if an element is covering the element you're looking for it will be the found one
[07:55:01] <emilkarl> hmm ok intreesting. thanks
[07:55:03] <joaocastanho> Cork this solution does work for mobile?
[07:55:11] <Cork> sure
[07:55:21] <joaocastanho> It doesnt seem so :/
[07:55:23] <joaocastanho> button does nothing
[07:55:24] <emilkarl> hmm I want all elements of the position tho
[07:55:46] <Cork> emilkarl: then the only option is to loop them
[07:56:54] <emilkarl> not just the hmm k
[08:04:57] <lalalaaa> Hi! Has e.preventDefault stopped working in newer versions of jQuery?
[08:05:22] <lalalaaa> I'm getting it all over my app. Haven't touched my JS in months, used to work just fine.
[08:05:36] <medted> so, async:false deprecteated, i need to use jquery to load scripts using getscript, any ideas how i can make sure they are loaded before anything else happends
[08:05:38] <Woet> no, it hasn't stopped working
[08:05:55] <Woet> lalalaaa: check your console
[08:05:57] <Woet> lalalaaa: and test case in www.jsfiddle.net please
[08:06:01] <medted> i cant understand how using a callback can help me
[08:06:30] <Woet> medted: whatever you rely on the js script for should be in the callback
[08:06:37] <Woet> medted: so it gets executed once the script has been loaded.
[08:06:38] <medted> Why?
[08:06:55] <lalalaaa> Woet: one sec
[08:07:05] <Woet> medted: .. because else it gets executed before the script is loaded?
[08:07:31] <medted> my approach wont allow me to do that, i have a quite dynamic header, which always loads the scripts using getscript. What happends after that depends on what page i am
[08:08:10] <Woet> medted: demonstrate your issue on www.jsfiddle.net please
[08:08:28] <medted> ill try...
[08:08:42] <medted> might be hard to explain the WHY part of my solution with jsfiddle
[08:09:18] <Woet> medted: shouldn't be.
[08:10:06] <Cork> medted: there is only two options, use script tags in the html to load the script
[08:10:22] <Cork> or don't execute the rest of the code until the callback from getScript is fired
[08:10:40] <Cork> (meaning structure the code in function(s) and call them from the callback)
[08:12:23] <medted> https://jsfiddle.net/rtp51k4o/
[08:12:25] <medted> there you go
[08:12:27] <medted> complete example
[08:12:34] <medted> with links to the real external resources
[08:13:03] <medted> the scripts file loaded continues to load more script files from the server
[08:13:14] <medted> one of those scripts contain a function i need on this specific page
[08:13:29] <Cork> medted: and the script in the page should be called as a function when that script is done
[08:14:17] <medted> yes
[08:14:18] <Cork> medted: https://jsfiddle.net/rtp51k4o/1/
[08:14:28] <Cork> call scriptsLoadingComplete() from inside scripts
[08:14:44] <medted> well, thats one solution.. :D
[08:14:46] <medted> ill try
[08:14:48] <Cork> and scripts.js should use the callbacks to track when all scripts has been loaded
[08:14:58] <Cork> and when that is done fire the function
[08:15:08] <Cork> deferred can help there
[08:15:20] <medted> that means that on every page where i use the scripts i need to run everything inside the callback function i guess
[08:15:34] <Cork> yes, as you load it this way
[08:15:39] <Cork> (something i wouldn't recommend)
[08:16:44] <medted> the idea here is to have a client page, and only load one single script, and your ready to go
[08:17:28] <medted> also for future maintenance, i dont need to edit code stored on the client server,i just edit the code on the server
[08:17:52] <medted> client page consists of the script, a few hardcoded variables and dom elements which trigger functions on the server
[08:18:15] <Cork> medted: this is another option https://jsfiddle.net/rtp51k4o/2/
[08:18:17] <medted> ajax hell i know, but transparent and independent on the CMS system
[08:19:18] <medted> why can i only see 2 rows of the javascript.. :D
[08:20:37] <medted> but yes, this is what im going to use, i only need to do this for one script so ill just put it inside that script and wait
[08:20:37] <medted> $(document).trigger('my-custom-scripts-loaded');
[08:21:00] <medted> i've never seen a simple trigger example so i never created my own, thanks for this
[08:21:35] <Cork> medted: another option https://jsfiddle.net/rtp51k4o/3/
[08:21:59] <Cork> the last one is cleaner as it doesn't force you to add a lot of event listeners to the dom (something that slows it down)
[08:25:16] <jose3_> Hello Can someone help me with returning a value from this?
[08:28:54] <Cork> jose3_: you're leaving out way to much context
[08:29:56] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/8V7JtEut/
[08:30:14] <Cork> => jsfiddle.net
[08:32:52] <jose3_> https://jsfiddle.net/ptvu1w5d/
[08:33:31] <Cork> wow... all your variables are globals...
[08:33:45] <Cork> that's a BAD idea
[08:34:08] <Cork> and... click of form??
[08:34:12] <lenswipe> heyg uys
[08:34:14] <lenswipe> hey guys*
[08:34:55] <jose3_> elaborate on the global bit
[08:35:15] <Cork> jose3_: something = 1; is the exact same thing as window.something = 1
[08:35:35] <Cork> you need to define the variable to make it local => var something = 1;
[08:36:00] <Cork> var something; something = 1; is another way to make it local
[08:36:08] <jose3_> Oh I see. Declare them 1st with 'var' ?
[08:36:14] <Cork> yes
[08:36:33] <Cork> also for your original problem, you need to ask it if you want help
[08:36:54] <Cork> just linking to a section of code with no html to match is close to impossible to answer
[08:37:02] <jose3_> https://jsfiddle.net/ptvu1w5d/1/
[08:37:08] <Cork> (especially as one doesn't know what the problem is)
[08:37:10] <jose3_> I have this code- it works in console
[08:37:16] <jose3_> I see a data array
[08:37:23] <jose3_> however at data on the bottom
[08:37:27] <jose3_> I cant return it
[08:37:40] <jose3_> I can't call 'data' from the dom to manipulate further
[08:38:11] <Cork> how is the data suppose to get to someFunction?
[08:38:19] <Cork> ah sorry there
[08:38:39] <Cork> why can't you?
[08:40:43] <jose3_> When i just type data into chrome it says: a
[08:40:43] <jose3_> data is not defined(…)
[08:41:08] <Cork> jose3_: 1. add the needed html to match the code you put into jsfiddle
[08:41:16] <Cork> 2. reproduce the problem as running code in the fiddle
[08:41:35] <Cork> then i might be able to understand what you're hinting at
[08:41:46] <Cork> but currently you're not giving enough context to understand the problem
[08:42:15] <jose3_> https://jsfiddle.net/ptvu1w5d/3/
[08:43:06] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ptvu1w5d/4/ <-- updated to load jquery
[08:43:37] <Cork> anyway currently you call someFunction(result);
[08:44:01] <Cork> but you never store the return value so... where exactly do you expect to be able to access it?
[08:44:02] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/SDYYWA5W/
[08:44:15] <jose3_> so the console.log's work
[08:44:25] <jose3_> I just want this though return data;
[08:44:36] <jose3_> so that I can use the object
[08:57:03] <jose3_> Ok i got it
[09:03:12] <nindustries> Hi, anyone using jsTree? Im using the State plugin, but it saves the contextmenu too. Any idea how I can ommit tht?
[09:03:19] <jose3_> how can I handle this in javascript? ```[{"Phone1":"(666) 666-6666","FirstName":"T","PostalCode":"000","Id":1545569,"City":"T","LastName":"T"}]```
[09:03:43] <jose3_> THe problem is that it is in an array for me, however not really because it is a string
[09:35:09] <taplar> jose3_: you'd need to parse the string
[09:36:06] <jose3_> thanks
[09:36:26] <taplar> JSON.parse() or $.parseJson()
[10:36:19] <Duikb00t> o/
[10:36:29] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/fd807edy/2/ somene a suggestion to make a better transition >< failwhale
[10:44:16] <AwkwardCough> what are you wanting it to do?
[10:46:59] <jose3_> is this a valid js comparrison to test one var to 3 possible results?
[10:47:00] <Duikb00t> I want them to 'fade in'
[10:47:08] <Duikb00t> li item after li item
[10:47:09] <Duikb00t> smooooth
[10:47:18] <jose3_> ot do i need to compate each value 3 times
[10:47:22] <Duikb00t> But I think im on the good way but it's behaviour is still weird
[10:47:45] <taplar> jose3_: you can do an in list check
[10:48:26] <Duikb00t> taplar:  o/ o/ !
[10:48:41] <taplar> what is 'o/' ?
[10:48:49] <jose3_> this you mean ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2430000/determine-if-string-is-in-list-in-javascript
[10:48:51] <Duikb00t> o = the head and / is  a arm
[10:48:58] <Duikb00t> o/ = hi !
[10:49:05] <taplar> oh, like a raised arm?
[10:49:08] <Duikb00t> yes
[10:49:11] <taplar> gotcha
[10:49:27] <taplar> jose3_: yep
[10:49:34] <taplar> indexOf > -1
[10:51:11] <jose3_> coool
[10:51:13] <Duikb00t> hmm
[10:51:13] <jose3_> never done that before
[10:51:16] <jose3_> you the man
[10:51:23] <jose3_> or woman
[10:52:07] <taplar> may have something for you Duikb00t in just a sec

[10:53:34] <AwkwardCough> ?
[10:53:50] <Duikb00t> What have you changed oO
[10:53:51] <Duikb00t> opacity 0?
[10:54:05] <Duikb00t> That's exactly what Im looking fur.
[10:54:05] <AwkwardCough> yup and animate to fadeIn
[10:54:42] <Duikb00t> hmm
[10:54:45] <Duikb00t> I tought I had that
[10:54:46] <Duikb00t> but its not
[10:54:56] <Duikb00t> :D thanks a lot AwkwardCough
[10:55:30] <AwkwardCough> np
[10:56:39] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fd807edy/4/ here's this.  it's not as smooth as what you had, but it's using an event rather than the timeout.  maybe it'll give you some ideas
[10:57:06] <Duikb00t> No no that's not really what I need it's excactly what AwkwardCough made :D
[10:57:11] <Duikb00t> at the start they are all invisibel
[10:57:23] <taplar> gotcha
[10:59:14] <taplar> beat me to a solution.  et tu brutisCough!
[11:00:05] <AwkwardCough> eh to be fair mine was a quick fix while your solution is probably better down the line doing it as an event instead of timeout
[11:02:10] <Duikb00t> hihi
[11:02:27] <AwkwardCough> hello again
[11:02:41] <yanome> maybe, my googling is bad, but i'm struggling to find documentation for initialization variables for jquery.formset; (basically, i'm trying to fix a bug where the 'AddText' disappears after the last form has been removed using 'Remove')
[11:03:10] <yanome> specifically the js side not the django side. i've handled the error on the server side, but now the bug i'm encountering is client side
[11:05:46] <taplar> i found the source i believe, not finding any docs really
[11:10:01] <yanome> taplar: yea, that's the problem i'm running into :-\
[11:10:19] <yanome> i found the initial release blog post about it but it mostly talks about a very simple use-case
[11:42:48] <jdc_> hello! I am having a issue with using jquery mobile, google says and I have experieced that it isn't configuring right for mobile devices
[11:43:00] <jdc_> is there any fixes or things i could do?
[11:43:13] <jdc_> i have used <meta viewport blah blah blah
[11:43:26] <jdc_> and it says it doesnt :/
[11:45:58] <YokoBR> hi folks
[11:46:26] <jdc_> hi @YokoBR
[11:46:50] <YokoBR> I'm getting a json return from an ajax call.. how do i check if the response.detail has the string "Invalid username" ?
[11:47:37] <YokoBR> I've tryied many ways but none worked
[11:48:19] <taplar> i'm assuming the response is already parsed?
[11:49:01] <YokoBR> like if (/Invalid username/i.test(response.detail)) or if (response.detail.toLowerCase().indexOf("Invalid username") >= 0)
[11:49:05] <jdc_> idk sorry :/
[11:49:10] <YokoBR> yep, it's parsed
[11:49:11] <jdc_> do you have the code?
[11:49:19] <jdc_> i can take a look at it if you need me to
[11:49:29] <taplar> response.detail.indexOf('Invalid username') > -1
[11:49:33] <jdc_> i am not familiar with it i am here for a issue with jquery mobile
[11:51:29] <taplar> do you control the endpoint?
[11:51:40] <jdc_> @YokoBR - @taplar has a answer...
[11:51:59] <joaocastanho> If I do this inside a function img = result; will it work if I call img outside?
[11:52:12] <taplar> depends on if img is a var in the function or not
[11:52:16] <jdc_> you can always try it
[11:52:32] <taplar> if you want img to be available outside the function you'll want to declare it as a var outside first
[11:52:56] <taplar> *in a shared scope by the function and the other place your wanting to use it
[11:53:11] <joaocastanho> ah okay. right now I just have this img = result inside function
[11:53:14] <joaocastanho> so it wont work?
[11:53:27] <taplar> it will most likely work, but that's making it completely global
[11:53:28] <YokoBR> taplar: It worked, many thanks :)
[11:53:34] <taplar> you want to scope it down
[11:54:38] <joaocastanho> so I should do var img = ''; outside function first right?
[11:56:15] <taplar> you don't have to set it to anything, just declare it
[12:12:11] <joaocastanho> thanks taplar it worked
[12:20:16] <WebDragon> I dunno if anyone else has noticed this, but http://jquery.com/download/ has not been updated to reflect the current jquery-migrate version as https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/releases is up to 1.4.1 -- the downloads page still shows 1.3.0
[12:21:01] <WebDragon> I was lucky to have just worked with the https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-migrate which shows its version as 1.4.1, which is why I remembered it
[12:21:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd let #jquery-dev know
[12:21:22] <robertmaxrees> or drop in a bug on the site's repo.
[12:22:03] <z1haze_work> can anyone tell me why the 'close' icon for my jquery-ui dialog isnt displaying? https://dev04-web-kendo.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-KVD-Site/default/Account-ProStart
[12:24:59] <taplar> it's it showing in the top left corner?
[12:25:04] <taplar> floating off all on it's won
[12:25:07] <taplar> *own
[12:25:17] <z1haze_work> the link is showing
[12:25:22] <z1haze_work> top right corner
[12:25:28] <z1haze_work> just no image
[12:25:49] <taplar> i saw a little X button on the top right of a power icon in the top left corner first visit to that page
[12:26:23] <z1haze_work> its adding the classes 'ui-icon ui-icon-closethick' to the buttons, removing em fixes but.. but why is it adding them?
[12:26:34] <z1haze_work> i pulled this same code from our production site and it works fine, it doenst add thsoe classes there
[12:26:58] <robertmaxrees> different versions of jqui?
[12:27:49] <robertmaxrees> not including certain files?
[12:27:55] <robertmaxrees> could be all kjinds of things.
[12:28:09] <taplar> terrorists
[12:28:21] <WebDragon> thanks robertmaxrees -- I'll drop in on #jquery-dev and failing that, post it to the repo
[12:28:44] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon they operate mostly out of bug reports, so you'll probably have more luck there.
[12:29:15] <WebDragon> cheers :)
[12:29:21] <z1haze_work> same versions
[12:29:29] <WebDragon> and I see there's a 3.0 in the works. sheesh I gots me some readings to do
[12:29:32] <robertmaxrees> z1haze no idea then without seeing it.
[12:29:32] <z1haze_work> it supposed to be removing those classes
[12:29:41] <z1haze_work> thats why i posted a link to the site robertmaxrees
[12:29:44] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon yeah, 3.0 is kind of like 1.8 - big changes.
[12:29:54] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work huh?
[12:30:06] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have something else breaking things.
[12:30:09] <WebDragon> yeah so I see, and its own separate migrate that you run in series, with the old migrate first
[12:30:15] <robertmaxrees> you can if you want.
[12:30:18] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees
[12:30:18] <z1haze_work> you said 'no idea without seeing it'
[12:30:26] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work the site that works i mean.
[12:30:34] <z1haze_work> oh
[12:30:34] <robertmaxrees> you're telling me there's one that works and one that doesn't.
[12:30:48] <z1haze_work> yea its just those classes it adds that foobars it
[12:30:59] <robertmaxrees> then figure out what the conflict is ;)
[12:31:09] <z1haze_work> working site though: https://www.katvondbeauty.com/shop-all-products/eye/shade-light-eye-contour-palette/21712.html if you click the little envelope to send to friend
[12:33:48] <jude_> hey, i have a question how does on use the callback after fetching a json object into a variable. I have this at the moment but I keep having function level variables declared as undefined. I understand it may have to do with asyncronous calls. Is there best practice to handle this? or just change to syncronous? https://gist.github.com/jmwenda/73729855ebb70cd483c9078031465c68
[12:34:07] <robertmaxrees> never use synchronous.
[12:34:10] <ExoUNX> is there a way to bypass the iPad on jQuery where it loads css classes into the body element?
[12:34:36] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX huh?
[12:35:08] <robertmaxrees> jude_ $scope.hipsterIpsum = $.getJSON(sql_link); doesn't set that var to the result of the ajax call.
[12:35:10] <robertmaxrees> you want to use .then()
[12:35:59] <jude_> is this at the end of the $scope?
[12:36:10] <robertmaxrees> jude_ it has nothing to do with scope.
[12:36:33] <robertmaxrees> $.getJSON(sql_link).then(function(theData) { /* anything that relies on the data existing here */ });
[12:36:37] <robertmaxrees> gotta use a callback.
[12:36:55] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX jquery doesn't add classes - jqui and jqmobile do, but jquery itself doesn't.
[12:38:42] <robertmaxrees> z1haze yeah, it looks like the :before is getting shoved to the side of the page.
[12:38:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd check to make sure you're not, like, setting relative positioning on body or something weird like that.
[12:39:09] <WebDragon> ExoUNX: either jquery-ui is in play, or one of the scripts written in jquery is adding them -- jquery itself alone doesn't drop classes on body -- maybe you're using modernizr ?
[12:39:12] <z1haze_work> i made a fix, just binded to the open event and removed thsoe 2 extra classes
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i'd fix the underlying issue instead.
[12:39:25] <z1haze_work> i dont know why it adds them, but i didnt make the original dialog so they probably had a reason
[12:39:38] <z1haze_work> its supposed to be that way robertmaxrees
[12:39:42] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon fwiw there's no such thing as "written in jquery"
[12:39:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:39:48] <z1haze_work> they allow you to use your own custom icons/buttons instead
[12:40:01] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work right, sounds like you're working against the library is what i'm saying.
[12:40:05] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: a mere bag of shells ;)
[12:40:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:40:26] <z1haze_work> ah
[12:40:26] * WebDragon hides a chuckle in his enormous coffeemug
[12:40:30] <z1haze_work> yea probably, but have no time
[12:40:36] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon uh, 'kay?
[12:40:38] <jude_> How do i parse theData to a variable accessible outside the function. I would like to return the value i.e https://gist.github.com/jmwenda/73729855ebb70cd483c9078031465c68#file-gistfile1-txt-L13 ?
[12:40:43] <robertmaxrees> jude_ you can't.
[12:40:44] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: it's a rather old expression
[12:40:50] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon i've never heard it.
[12:41:02] <robertmaxrees> jude_ any code that relies on the return of that data needs to be inside that .then() callback.
[12:41:10] <WebDragon> honeymooner's Ralph Kramden used it a lot
[12:41:18] <robertmaxrees> cool?
[12:41:54] <jude_> so i guess i have to build another variable and loop within the then, will it be available outside it?
[12:42:02] <WebDragon> sort of a brooklynism, for 'for all intents and purposes'
[12:42:18] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon sure - and i'm pointing out that jquery isn't really anything like a language ;)
[12:42:26] <robertmaxrees> jude_ the ajax call is asynchronous, so that won't work.
[12:42:35] <robertmaxrees> you need to restructure your code to work with the async nature.
[12:43:04] <WebDragon> this may be true, but its a distinction that makes no actual difference in my life, so I just run with it
[12:43:06] <jude_> ahh ok thanks and i guess both get and getjson are asynchronous
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon it makes a tremendous difference.
[12:43:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:43:41] <robertmaxrees> jude_ right, they both use $.ajax() under the hood :)
[12:43:53] <WebDragon> technically speaking, while correct, this difference makes little difference in the code I write for jquery (or any other language, framework, or whatever)
[12:43:56] <hobo> if i have a form with values, is there a jquery function to serialize only certain inputs?
[12:44:05] <WebDragon> just in how one refers to it
[12:44:37] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon that reference is important.
[12:44:51] <WebDragon> 'in jquery' could have just as easily been inferring 'inside the jquery framework'
[12:44:53] <WebDragon> or whatever
[12:45:06] <robertmaxrees> excpt jquery isn't technically a framework either ;)
[12:45:07] <WebDragon> not distinctly meaning as a programming language
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't refer to rails as a language, for instance.
[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> or spring.
[12:45:33] <WebDragon> since I don't use either of those, I woudln't refer to them anyway =8)
[12:45:52] <robertmaxrees> heh, you don't call them languages.
[12:46:01] <robertmaxrees> you'd get a lot of really funny looks if you did.
[12:46:07] <WebDragon> well technically I didn't call jquery a language either
[12:46:09] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a library.  not a langugae.
[12:46:14] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:46:16] <robertmaxrees> alright mang.
[12:46:17] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[12:46:23] <WebDragon> you inferred that was what I meant by my phrasing :)
[12:46:36] <robertmaxrees> and then you defended that point ;)
[12:46:38] * WebDragon *chuckles* I'm not trying to be difficult, just enjoying the banter
[12:46:54] <robertmaxrees> while further confusing some of the newbies we get in here.
[12:46:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:48:28] <WebDragon> so, inasmuch as this discussion has occurred, you've never gone on and said what jquery actually IS (so as to unconfuse the newbies) -- just stated that it isn't a language, nor is it a framework
[12:48:48] <WebDragon> we could go on all day naming all the things jquery is not, could we not ? :)
[12:48:52] <robertmaxrees> you might want to rethink that ;)
[12:49:14] <robertmaxrees> read up a bit.
[12:49:25] <WebDragon> ahh yes, so you did
[12:49:33] <WebDragon> missed that bit
[12:49:53] * WebDragon drinks more coffee
[12:55:29] <taplar> we should refer to it as an ebook.  no one knows what a library is anymore
[12:56:36] <taplar> or an up-doc
[12:59:41] * taplar hopes someone asked themselves the question
[13:00:49] <WebDragon> heh
[13:02:50] <taplar> fwiw, if you want a chuckle, and have not seen it before, google 'LOLCODE'
[13:17:38] <robertmaxrees> hella
[13:17:53] <taplar> kthxbye !
[13:17:56] <taplar> heh
[13:17:57] <robertmaxrees> D:
[13:18:08] <robertmaxrees> ;__; taplar pls
[13:18:15] <taplar> huh?
[13:18:26] <robertmaxrees> don't leave me
[13:18:29] <taplar> lmao
[13:18:59] <taplar> don't worry, i'll always be here..... for 5 more hours
[13:19:11] <robertmaxrees> 60% of the time, it works every time.
[13:19:35] <taplar> that reminds me of what one of our user services said once
[13:19:47] <taplar> they were testing a change and found something that didn't work right so they told the programmer
[13:19:57] <taplar> and according to them, they said, 'well it works 90% of the time'
[13:20:07] <taplar> so she said, 'ok, i'll pass 90% of the ticket'
[13:20:25] <taplar> she's an awesome lady, :)
[13:25:35] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:25:36] <robertmaxrees> that's awesome.
[13:49:26] <AwkwardCough> whats up-doc?
[13:49:43] <taplar> i miss you man
[13:49:49] <AwkwardCough> :D
[13:50:59] <taplar> up-docs were an old form of communication, however they were deprecated as they were usually associated with bugs
[13:52:10] <AwkwardCough> huh... i feel subconsciously disappointed
[13:52:26] <taplar> that you didn't get to use them, or at my joke?
[13:52:52] <taplar> lmao, "you in general"
[13:53:55] <AwkwardCough> both
[13:54:17] <taplar> harsh
[13:55:57] <SuperPhly> Ugh, why are none of the submenu links on this page working? I'm trying to look into the inspector in Chrome, but fail to see anything preventing a click: https://olympia-consulting.net/
[13:56:27] <robertmaxrees> they work fine here.
[13:57:37] <SuperPhly> robertmaxrees: from the homepage/
[13:57:38] <SuperPhly> ?
[13:57:43] <robertmaxrees> SuperPhly yes.
[13:58:17] <SuperPhly> https://olympia-consulting.net/ -- clicking on salesforce consulting works? What browser?
[13:58:33] <robertmaxrees> oh, links IN subnavs.
[13:58:34] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:59:09] <SuperPhly> I see a list of events, but can't find the offending JS...
[14:00:13] <robertmaxrees> no clue.  i'd have to search using thgose classnames.
[14:03:45] <taplar> seeing as how those are real links and the url isn't changing, my first guess would be whatever is hiding the menu on a click is cancelling the event so it doesn't actually go to that url
[14:08:38] <taplar> and it does look like your links have two bindings on them
[14:12:47] <taplar> ok, whatever it is, it's the first binding
[14:12:58] <taplar> i took it off and the menu didn't disappear, but it did go to the link
[14:13:23] <taplar> so a few more pointers for you, :)
[14:22:11] <harry1> try to find how and where this is being set in some code: self.data.serverTime
[14:22:24] <harry1> is it a typical/common variable seen before
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[14:22:43] <robertmaxrees> just search for serverTime = or serverTime:
[14:27:49] <harry1> mm could it be this: serverTime: ~~(Date.now() / 1000)
[14:28:15] <taplar> is that in the js?
[14:28:53] <harry1> yeah
[14:28:55] <taplar> if so then that is a misname as that's not server time
[14:29:08] <harry1> the problem is that it doesn't account for the summer time
[14:29:15] <harry1> so the time is one hour out
[14:29:21] <taplar> it's also subject to your users clock
[14:29:27] <taplar> not the 'server' time
[14:29:41] <harry1> yeah I see
[14:30:07] <harry1> it should go by the users clock - so that's ok but like you say a mis-named var
[14:30:23] <harry1> is there a way to have it account for my local time zone setting
[14:30:37] <taplar> take a look at momentjs, possibly
[14:30:57] <taplar> http://momentjs.com/
[14:31:36] <Uhkis> moment is great
[14:32:01] <taplar> yeah it's a pretty good kelly clarkson song
[14:32:24] <Uhkis> dont know about that
[14:33:06] <taplar> :o
[14:33:33] <taplar> ^ that's the face people make when they hear it
[14:33:47] <taplar> it's like chocolate cake
[14:35:20] <taplar> chocolate sounds streaming from your radio into your ears and giving your brain diabeties
[14:36:10] * taplar feels like the room has become desensitized to his idiocy
[14:37:48] <harry1> lol
[14:37:58] <harry1> i've used moment.js before
[14:42:48] <Uhkis> taplar: you wish! that brain diabetes was very offensive to diabetics!
[14:45:06] * taplar realizes he can't make a comeback without dissing diabetics
[14:45:08] <taplar> touche
[14:47:44] <AwkwardCough> sweet comeback bro
[14:48:07] <taplar> best i can do with a caked up brain
[14:57:53] <SomeLikeItHot> Hi everyone. I have "$('#content,#tab_wrap').on ('resize scroll', function ()...". I was wondering how I can include window in that line too so a resize or scroll can get trigger on window, #content or #tab_wrap
[14:58:59] <taplar> add(window) i believe
[14:59:30] <robertmaxrees> that sounds really dangerous heh.
[15:00:04] <SomeLikeItHot> taplar: That worked perfectly, thanks!
[15:00:06] <robertmaxrees> don't scroll and resize events bubble?
[15:00:23] <taplar> idk, i'd think so
[15:00:53] <taplar> resize, no
[15:01:14] <taplar> scroll "Not on elements, but bubbles to the default view when fired on the document"
[15:01:20] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[15:05:50] <Es0teric> does anyone know why this is not submitting to the autocomplete? http://pastebin.com/XFJvfJDd it doesnt populate the query on the network tab when typing into the input field
[15:06:34] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[15:06:49] <Es0teric> no
[15:07:05] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure the binding is firing?
[15:07:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees are you talking to me?
[15:07:23] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:07:44] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah, if i put it on a click, the query shows up on the network tab
[15:08:15] <robertmaxrees> put what on click?
[15:08:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees whats in the pastebin
[15:08:43] <robertmaxrees> right, so there's a document ready call and an init call for autocomplete.
[15:09:00] <Es0teric> right
[15:09:12] <Es0teric> so if i put that autocomplete init inside of a click i will see the query
[15:09:40] <robertmaxrees> are you sure you're loading things in the right order?  have you console.log()'d the element in question?
[15:09:47] <robertmaxrees> lots of things it could be.
[15:21:02] <harry1> what does this notation mean: ~~
[15:29:29] <robertmaxrees> double bitwise not.
[15:31:56] <harry1> is this jquery: Response.prototype.extract = function () {}
[15:32:03] <robertmaxrees> Nope.
[15:32:22] <robertmaxrees> jquery is usually aliased to $ - you'd see $() or $.someNameHere
[15:34:04] <harry1> is it pure jscript?
[15:34:12] <robertmaxrees> *javascript, and yeah.
[15:34:25] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric i'd have to see the problem actually happening - sounds like something doesn't exist when you think it does.
[15:34:36] <Es0teric> oh
[15:34:41] <Es0teric> i ended up fixing it
[15:34:41] <Es0teric> lol
[15:34:48] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[15:35:12] <Es0teric> i forgot that i commented out the js temporarily
[15:35:17] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:35:19] <Es0teric> the script import
[15:37:14] <diamonds> is there some built in method to do this? http://jsbin.com/vapali/edit?js,console,output
[15:37:18] <diamonds> on click only on SELF
[15:37:57] <robertmaxrees> you mean cases where the click happened on the element and not on a child of the element?
[15:38:02] * diamonds nods
[15:38:03] <diamonds> yeah
[15:38:15] <robertmaxrees> that's basically how you do it.
[15:38:24] <diamonds> hm
[15:38:51] <diamonds> seems like there should be some nifty $('#x').onSelf('click', fn)
[15:38:59] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[15:39:11] <diamonds> b-b-bu
[15:39:16] <diamonds> but...
[15:39:29] <robertmaxrees> more often then not you want the element and all descendents.
[15:39:42] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish in your case?
[15:39:58] <diamonds> I have a menu bar thing below a map
[15:40:13] <diamonds> and there's a little box in the middle of the menu with a bit of data you can set about map items
[15:40:27] <diamonds> if someone initiates an edit then clicks on the menu bar, I assume they want to cancel that edit
[15:40:40] <diamonds> but if they click the little box inside they are trying to set some data about the map item
[15:40:52] <diamonds> imagine there's a form in $b
[15:40:57] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[15:41:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:41:35] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want to stop certain events from bubbling :)
[15:42:01] <diamonds> I don't think so... that's why i checked the "from b" "from a"
[15:42:07] <diamonds> it looks like parent gets the event first?
[15:42:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:42:23] <robertmaxrees> jquery follows the bubbling model - doesn't handle capture phase.
[15:42:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd treat those as two different event handlers.
[15:42:52] <harry1> guys I'm missing some fundamnetal knowledge here, consider this bit of code
[15:42:53] <harry1> https://gist.github.com/spacebiscuit/a629b7e37b83ae3fd1e0c31d4c97e0c6
[15:43:15] <harry1> which there not a var prefix for Response?
[15:43:30] <harry1> do i need to call moment as a param on the function
[15:43:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:43:51] <robertmaxrees> those are two different questions heh
[15:43:52] <harry1> and why when i add a console.log does it not output anything in the console
[15:44:03] <z1haze_work> I have a question about the jquery validator library. I am using a select box plugin called selectric, basically it just makes pretty select boxes by replacing the select stuff with div's etc.. however its screwing up my validator because it changes the markup around
[15:44:05] <harry1> *why is there not
[15:44:13] <robertmaxrees> slow down :) Response is probably declared with function Response() {}
[15:44:23] <z1haze_work> is there a method or event I cna listen for in the validator to execute some code of my own?
[15:44:23] <harry1> k..
[15:44:24] <diamonds> http://jsbin.com/vapali/edit?html,js,console,output <-- why is b always last to fire here??
[15:44:28] <diamonds> confusing
[15:44:29] <robertmaxrees> harry1 moment is fine there.
[15:44:41] <z1haze_work> basically i need to search into the hidden select and see if the 'error' class exists, then change the parent.
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> harry1 and where are you putting the console log?
[15:44:55] <harry1> i tried console.log on moment() but I don't get any output
[15:45:02] <robertmaxrees> harry1 how...?
[15:45:07] <robertmaxrees> show me what you tried :)
[15:45:11] <harry1> before var result
[15:45:26] <robertmaxrees> that function will only run if it gets called.
[15:45:50] <robertmaxrees> diamonds lol you can't ask questions in bin and then keep editing it lol
[15:45:50] <harry1> updated
[15:45:51] <harry1> https://gist.github.com/spacebiscuit/a629b7e37b83ae3fd1e0c31d4c97e0c6
[15:46:02] <diamonds> oh sry should I hit update?
[15:46:17] <robertmaxrees> it's updating in realtime for the rest of us so i have no idea what i'm looking at.
[15:46:25] <diamonds> ah OK sry
[15:46:28] <diamonds> didn't know it did that :)
[15:46:34] <diamonds> you're seeing as I type? huh
[15:46:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/cz9a80z2/
[15:46:37] <robertmaxrees> this?
[15:47:03] <diamonds> robertmaxrees, you moved it to fiddle?
[15:47:08] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:47:16] <diamonds> ok I thought I was going crazy :p
[15:47:32] <diamonds> fiddle is a bit better when working with HTML I suppose
[15:47:39] <robertmaxrees> i prefer it overall.
[15:47:50] <robertmaxrees> so you're just trying to figure out what's firing when?
[15:48:26] <robertmaxrees> harry1 yeah, that'll work as long as that method gets called.
[15:48:36] <diamonds> well, trying to figure out why it goes C, A, B in mine
[15:48:43] <diamonds> in log order anyway
[15:48:47] <harry1> when i include that line it creates a bunch of errors in cole log
[15:48:54] <diamonds> but I suppose it may just be a race
[15:49:01] <robertmaxrees> harry1 what line?  what errors?  how're giving me nothing.
[15:49:02] <robertmaxrees> *you're
[15:49:11] <robertmaxrees> diamonds...
[15:49:20] <harry1> socket.io-1.3.5.js:2 GET http://xxxx.com:3002/socket.io/?EIO=3&transport=polling&t=1464896875150-17&sid=x4i0E_Bzdcu06qXEAAAA net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
[15:49:21] <robertmaxrees> you're binding handlers in that order.
[15:49:25] <robertmaxrees> c, a, and then b
[15:49:34] <harry1> for example ^^^
[15:49:36] <robertmaxrees> harry1 something funky is going on then.
[15:49:59] <robertmaxrees> diamonds either way, you had the correct basic idea.
[15:50:24] <diamonds> http://jsbin.com/vapali/edit?js,console,output this seems to work
[15:50:44] <harry1> robertmaxrees: I'm fixing up some code
[15:50:55] <harry1> im not sure if it's brilliantly written or a complete mess
[15:51:10] <robertmaxrees> diamonds i'd be careful with those partials heh.  but yeah, that e.target === this check is what you do.
[15:51:15] <taplar> harry1: if you have to ask
[15:51:21] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[15:51:26] <diamonds> what's wrong with curried function here?
[15:51:44] <robertmaxrees> diamonds it feels like you're using them for the sake of using them.
[15:51:51] <diamonds> I guess I'm not passing data, I could fix that
[15:52:03] <harry1> here is the bigger picture
[15:52:04] <harry1> https://gist.github.com/spacebiscuit/a629b7e37b83ae3fd1e0c31d4c97e0c6
[15:52:12] <diamonds> robertmaxrees, maybe... I like that it makes it a bit more clear/concise what I'm doing
[15:52:21] <harry1> this is in a file called Response.js on its own
[15:52:28] <harry1> why that's the case I don't know
[15:52:31] <diamonds> I M O
[15:52:38] <robertmaxrees> diamonds heh if i saw code like this i'
[15:52:45] <diamonds> d weep with joy
[15:52:45] <robertmaxrees> *i'd reject it from my codebase, but meh.
[15:52:53] <robertmaxrees> just feels like using features for the sake of using them.
[15:53:04] <diamonds> fair enough
[15:53:30] <diamonds> my view is that it can reduce repetition and increases clarity
[15:53:31] <robertmaxrees> harry1 right, so something is calling this file.
[15:53:53] <robertmaxrees> diamonds there are plenty of ways to do that that don't require nesting partial calls like that ;)
[15:54:18] <diamonds> it sounds like you don't like higher order functions at all :p
[15:54:23] <diamonds> robertmaxrees, do you have an alt method in mind?
[15:54:45] <diamonds> I mean I came here cuz I thought maybe jQ had something built in, only wrote a function for it for the heck of it, sorta to see that it'd work
[15:55:08] <diamonds> I only have 1x in my codebase right now doing that check so I'm not gonna write an extra function for it right now
[15:55:37] <robertmaxrees> diamonds i love higher order functions, just when they make sense to use heh.
[15:55:51] <robertmaxrees> either way, your basic idea is what the docs will tell you to do.
[15:56:04] <diamonds> mmm thx
[15:56:42] <diamonds> sorry to waste your time with a js fiddle that's Production Ready & passing code review!
[15:56:45] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:56:46] <diamonds> I'll be more careful in the future ;)
[15:56:48] <robertmaxrees> yo.
[15:56:52] <robertmaxrees> i just made an aside.
[15:56:55] <robertmaxrees> do what you want mano.
[15:56:57] <robertmaxrees> it's not a big deal.
[15:57:16] <taplar> what fiddle we talking about?  i only saw a jsbin
[15:57:22] <robertmaxrees> that's what he's talking about.
[15:57:24] <diamonds> :p juuuust razzin ya. thx for your help
[15:57:37] <taplar> cause "l" alone would make me reject the code
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:57:45] * diamonds rolls eyes.
[15:57:50] <diamonds> jesus christ...
[15:58:00] <robertmaxrees> lol so you can dish but you can't take?
[15:58:03] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:58:15] <diamonds> y'all use jsbin/fiddle waaaaay differently than I do
[15:58:17] <taplar> if your that concerned with file size, maybe you should reconsider using a library like jquery
[15:58:28] <diamonds> taplar, I never use jquery
[15:58:35] <diamonds> too much bloat
[15:58:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:58:40] <robertmaxrees> then why are you using it here?
[15:58:46] <taplar> $('#a')
[15:58:54] <taplar> ^ jQ
[15:59:03] <diamonds> plus I read an email on a newsgroup from 2009 that said the API was bad
[15:59:12] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:59:21] <diamonds> ^__^
[15:59:24] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:59:37] <robertmaxrees> i can't wait for my vacation
[15:59:44] <taplar> i've probably read a post/article/blog that everything is bad to someone
[15:59:58] <robertmaxrees> Articles about things being problematic are problematic.
[15:59:59] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:01:07] <diamonds> robertmaxrees, srsly tho do you have an alt. approach in mind for that onlySelf type thing that doesn't use a curried function like that?
[16:01:37] <diamonds> I mean, assuming I don't want to repeat if(e.target === this) // for some reason
[16:01:45] <diamonds> (I'm just curious, the solution is in hand obvs.)
[16:01:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd just pull that into its own function that returns a bool.  pass it the event object, et.
[16:02:00] <robertmaxrees> *etc.
[16:02:03] <robertmaxrees> keep it simple.
[16:02:14] <robertmaxrees> but i'm sure you'll have some reason that's not simple or w/e
[16:04:24] <diamonds> no, nothing but a trivial note that .click(handleClick) becomes .click(function(e, data){ if(selfClicked(this, e)){ handleClick(e, data) } }
[16:04:32] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:04:34] <diamonds> hmm... you'd have to pass `this` in no?
[16:04:45] <robertmaxrees> you could bind it if need be, or explicitly pass it.
[16:04:51] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to skin that cat.
[16:04:59] <robertmaxrees> do whatever suits your codebase.
[16:05:04] <taplar> i'd be tempted to make a $.fn.onSelf
[16:05:14] <diamonds> now yer talkin~!~
[16:05:16] <robertmaxrees> and i avoid anonymous functions as much as possible.
[16:05:24] * diamonds nods
[16:05:28] <robertmaxrees> they make me sad.
[16:06:41] <taplar> woah, i just noticed, dunno if it was mentioned before, but those elements are in the head and not the body
[16:07:08] <diamonds> yeah that's the new thing now
[16:07:12] <diamonds> loads faster
[16:07:18] <robertmaxrees> hurr
[16:07:20] <taplar> huh?
[16:07:22] <diamonds> y'see, the head loads BEFORE the body
[16:07:26] <robertmaxrees> (he's kidding)
[16:07:28] <taplar> -_-
[16:07:31] <diamonds> so why wait 'til the body is loading? just load it in the head
[16:07:39] <taplar> ok, i was fixing to say, i feel like i'm being trolled
[16:07:44] <Es0teric> ok so i have a completely different problem now... this time it doesnt make any sense... http://pastebin.com/AqsSsrE6 -- it spits out the error: jquery.autocomplete.min.js:8 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined
[16:12:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vo4tzgpz/
[16:13:22] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees, do you have an idea of what could cause that?
[16:13:23] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3710835/jquery-autocomplete-does-not-show-up
[16:13:28] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend :)
[16:13:29] <diamonds> taplar, nice thx
[16:14:07] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i looked that up already
[16:14:14] <robertmaxrees> that's all i can really guide you with.
[16:14:16] <diamonds> probably would get more complicated if passing data, but not terribly so
[16:14:16] <robertmaxrees> sorry duder.
[16:14:33] <robertmaxrees> diamonds you're not passing data into handlers when binding them, are you?
[16:14:34] <taplar> passing data?
[16:16:28] <diamonds> I think jquery allows $('a').trigger('eventName', { more : 'data', foo : 123 })
[16:16:47] <diamonds> but idk if that bubbles
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, sure, though you want to avoid doing that as much as possible.
[16:17:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery makes for a terrible pub/sub.
[16:17:05] * diamonds shrugs
[16:17:07] <diamonds> yeah
[16:17:26] <diamonds> I just noticed that issue in my own onlySelf function -- It would drop any data
[16:20:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vo4tzgpz/1/
[16:21:07] <diamonds> nice B)
[16:40:38] <jamiejackson> hi folks. i'm working with some old code where it's selecting something like: $(":input[name=\"firstname\"]", $theForm)
[16:40:47] <jamiejackson> when i upgrade jquery, it seems to fail.
[16:41:11] <jamiejackson> how would i change that to grab that input from that specified element?
[16:41:27] <taplar> is $theForm a jQ object?
[16:41:31] <robertmaxrees> $theForm.find('input[name="firstname"]);
[16:41:45] <robertmaxrees> missing a closing quote, but you get the idea.
[16:41:49] <jamiejackson> yeah,  it's defined as: var $theForm = $(e).closest("form");
[16:42:02] <robertmaxrees> $(e) being an event object?
[16:42:10] <jamiejackson> will try, robertmaxrees
[16:46:52] <taplar> gah, i can tell i don't deal with radios all that much.  just wrote a jasmine test for an interaction with one and for a moment was confused why clicking one didn't unselect the other. ..... i didn't give the test setup ones a name
[16:49:49] <robertmaxrees> very nice ;)
[16:49:53] <robertmaxrees> i do stuff like thjat sometimes.
[16:52:06] <Maxou> hey ! i have a problem maybe som1 can help me : my litle jquery script don't work :/ type is ok but i can't change sizefield max attr : $('.fieldType').blur(function() {var type = $(this).val(); if (type == "INT") $(this).closest('input.fieldSize').attr("max", "2147483647"); });
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> .prop
[16:53:46] <jamiejackson> robertmaxrees: "e" appears to be a form element: e = $("#password")[0];
[16:54:03] <jamiejackson> happen to know why they might have used the [0]?
[16:54:10] <taplar> it breaks out of the jquery object
[16:54:11] <robertmaxrees> for an ID?  nope.
[16:54:15] <robertmaxrees> except for that.
[16:54:32] <taplar> which you probably don't want since it looks like your re-wraping it else where
[16:55:10] <taplar> and maybe consider refactoring 'e' to something more readable, :)
[16:55:47] <robertmaxrees> like $passwordField
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:56:01] <taplar> sure
[16:56:48] <Maxou> robermaxrees i should use .prop instead .attr ?
[16:57:07] <robertmaxrees> Maxou yep.
[16:57:21] <Maxou> i will try
[16:57:42] <taplar> hold on...
[16:57:58] <taplar> that's not going to work.  and input field does not have children, right?
[16:58:07] <robertmaxrees> hah, truth
[16:58:28] <taplar> Maxou: closest() looks up through the parent elements for a match
[16:58:42] <taplar> what's the relation of the fieldSize to your fieldType?
[16:58:55] <Maxou> oh i used it in table before so i try in my form now :)
[16:59:42] <taplar> are they siblings of each other, or do they belong to a common parent?
[16:59:43] <Maxou> if user choose int type the max attr of field size should be 2147483647
[17:00:25] <taplar> not logically, dom wise
[17:00:31] <Maxou> not sure to undrstand your question
[17:00:46] <taplar> ok, do you understand dom nesting?
[17:01:52] <Maxou> I m beginer so i know what is the dom but not more :p
[17:01:56] <taplar> ok
[17:02:34] <taplar> <div><p><em></em></p><i><u></u></i></div>
[17:02:41] <taplar> bah, let me fiddle that
[17:04:06] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rox1uju2/
[17:04:54] <taplar> element betwee <something></something> are children of the something, and something is their parent
[17:05:05] <taplar> tags on the same level are siblings
[17:05:34] <taplar> clear as mud?
[17:05:40] <Maxou> let me see :D
[17:06:27] <Maxou> yeah seems ok for me :D
[17:06:37] <taplar> alright
[17:06:54] <taplar> so what closest() does is it looks for a parent that matches your selector
[17:07:19] <taplar> so with that in mind, what is the relation between fieldSize and fieldType?
[17:07:55] <Maxou> https://jsfiddle.net/r5z80xmw/
[17:08:10] <Maxou> sorry this is mess
[17:08:25] <taplar> so it's in the same row?
[17:09:12] <Maxou> yep
[17:09:50] <taplar> ok, so the row is a shared parent, right?
[17:10:30] <Maxou> yeah
[17:10:48] <taplar> ok, so you can use closest('tr') to find that shared parent
[17:11:12] <taplar> then you can find the fieldSize in that to get the related size input
[17:11:35] <taplar> you mentioned your newish.  have you read over learn.jquery.com?
[17:13:40] <Maxou> when i have a problem i m going on it yes but maybe i should review the basics ;)
[17:13:58] <taplar> i think you'd benefit greatly
[17:14:18] <robertmaxrees> little extra time now will save you a ton of time long-term.
[17:14:36] <Maxou> thx  i think I m not so far with you help
[17:15:01] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:17:45] <harry1> hey robertmaxrees sorry had to go eat
[17:18:04] <harry1> about that code I shared, something is calling it you said?
[17:18:24] <robertmaxrees> harry1 do you understand what xonstructors are?
[17:18:28] <robertmaxrees> *constructors
[17:20:37] <Maxou> i try 	$(this).closest('tr input.fieldSize').prop("max", 2147483647); but no :/
[17:20:48] <Maxou> oh i fortgot the td !
[17:21:13] <taplar> no, hold on
[17:21:28] <taplar> closest looks through parents only
[17:21:31] <taplar> think of it this way
[17:21:53] <taplar> your on level 3, closest looks for a match on level 2 and 1
[17:22:02] <taplar> it's not meant to find a 2 that has a sub level 4
[17:22:11] <taplar> just find a 2 or 1
[17:22:29] <taplar> once you find that, then you can look for your other thing
[17:22:51] <harry1> robertmaxrees: no it's not something I know about should I read up on this?
[17:23:00] <robertmaxrees> harry1 yep.  that's what's going on there.
[17:23:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a constructor.
[17:23:48] <harry1> ok maybe I'll have a read and come bac tomorrow
[17:23:56] <harry1> is it a javascript thing?>
[17:24:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.  it's the pattern in use there.  but before i send you down that road: what are you trying to do?
[17:25:32] <Maxou> one of them ! https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[17:25:46] <robertmaxrees> Maxou try learn.jquery.com
[17:25:56] <robertmaxrees> learn the basics first.
[17:28:08] <Maxou> yep robertmaxrees tomorow morning :D
[17:28:27] <Maxou> thx for you help
[17:35:45] <harry1> robertmaxrees: what am I trynig to do?
[17:35:55] <robertmaxrees> harry1 ...
[17:35:57] <robertmaxrees> how would i know?
[17:36:04] <harry1> in the short term simply add or use moment.js in that scope
[17:36:10] <robertmaxrees> then you should be fine.
[17:36:21] <harry1> sorry I was repeating your question aloud :)
[17:36:43] <robertmaxrees> moment is probably returning the wrong format.
[17:36:52] <robertmaxrees> which is why you're getting error.s
[17:42:18] <harry1> robertmaxrees: I'll have another look tomorrow
[17:42:24] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:42:25] <harry1> thanks for your help
[18:03:15] <taplar> robert, don't freak out.... but i'm leaving
[18:03:20] <robertmaxrees> WHAT NOOO
[18:03:24] <robertmaxrees> k fine jerk
[18:03:33] <taplar> i can only take so much fun
[18:03:55] <robertmaxrees> Liar :(
[18:04:07] <taplar> lol, true
[18:04:09] <taplar> later
[18:04:14] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeeeeee
[18:12:14] <Robdgreat> even if I don't have any styling applied, if I've properly invoked jquery validation plugin, I should see classes change when I type in supposedly affected fields, right?
[18:12:27] <Robdgreat> I haven't slept in over 24 hours and I feel about ready to harm myself
[18:12:33] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[18:12:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:12:43] <robertmaxrees> why haven't you slept in that long?
[18:12:54] <Robdgreat> I'm the worst at estimating how long something will take
[18:13:03] <Robdgreat> an 8 hour job has turned into 18+
[18:13:13] <robertmaxrees> can it be late?
[18:13:17] <Robdgreat> no
[18:13:30] <Robdgreat> I need the money  like today
[18:13:33] <robertmaxrees> :/
[18:13:44] <robertmaxrees> i can't remembet, but that should be the case iirc.
[18:14:05] <am55> Robdgreat, just curious if you will revise your fee with client?
[18:14:07] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming those classes?  the element inspector?
[18:14:07] <Robdgreat> it must be working to some degree because it's applied novalidate to all the fields in the form
[18:14:17] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, it's doing something.
[18:14:20] <am55> don't have any freelance experience but i've had some offers
[18:14:39] <am55> and worry about estimating time
[18:14:41] <robertmaxrees> also: as a rule of thumb, triple any estimate you have.
[18:14:55] <robertmaxrees> because of cases like this.
[18:14:57] <Robdgreat> yeah, I was desperate, unfortunately
[18:15:21] <robertmaxrees> so what's the actual problem you're having?>
[18:15:57] <Robdgreat> I may have used this before, but the more I think about it the more I think I might not have, and I sort of inherited a project that already had it working properly a few years ago
[18:16:15] <Robdgreat> I need to make fields change somehow when they validate
[18:16:27] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so it was working?
[18:16:32] <Robdgreat> no, not this
[18:16:36] <robertmaxrees> so this never worked?
[18:16:37] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[18:16:47] <Robdgreat> nope. I just put in the plugin a few minutes ago
[18:17:14] <robertmaxrees> oh, so the project you inherited that used it is not this one.
[18:17:14] <robertmaxrees> got it.
[18:17:19] <Robdgreat> right
[18:17:41] <robertmaxrees> so you're not getting validation failures?
[18:18:07] <Robdgreat> I'm not getting anything. No change in appearance and no change in rendered html when I type and delete in the form
[18:18:15] <Robdgreat> let's see if I can quickly pull this out into a fiddle
[18:18:19] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[18:18:24] <Robdgreat> nothing
[18:18:34] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/6qqw3nmg/
[18:18:41] <robertmaxrees> like, pretty basic stuff.
[18:20:27] <Robdgreat> what if I tried to set the rules in the validate method instead of the markup?
[18:20:51] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:20:52] <Robdgreat> my brain has been unraveling for hours
[18:20:59] <robertmaxrees> a lot of people munge how that works.
[18:21:38] <Robdgreat> I'm using the framework from hell that makes it annoying to change the form elements
[18:21:44] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[18:21:50] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out.  it's a common problem.
[18:22:33] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to make them required?
[18:22:40] <Robdgreat> yeah
[18:22:58] <robertmaxrees> and the form inputs have names on them, right?
[18:23:15] <Robdgreat> yeah, I was trying to access them by id
[18:23:32] <Robdgreat> I think the id and the name don't always coincide
[18:24:04] <robertmaxrees> right, soooo there's your problem: https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate#rules
[18:24:49] <robertmaxrees> you have to target the form element and then configure the rules against that.
[18:25:22] <Robdgreat> so each form element needs to be valediate()d separately?
[18:25:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:25:27] <Robdgreat> wtf
[18:25:28] <Robdgreat> validated
[18:25:30] <robertmaxrees> no
[18:25:33] <Robdgreat> validate()d ok
[18:25:36] <robertmaxrees> exact opposite.
[18:25:43] <robertmaxrees> there is a single .validate() call against the form.
[18:26:05] <Robdgreat> ok, stand by
[18:26:23] <robertmaxrees> but i think you're ultimately confused by how it targets inputs :)
[18:26:30] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying to do though.
[18:27:59] <Robdgreat> I don't even know where the actual form element is so I did $('form.form-horizontal input').validate({ onkeyup: true, rules: { name: { required: true }, email: {required: true, email: true}, etc
[18:28:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:28:21] <robertmaxrees> $('form.form-horizontal').
[18:28:25] <robertmaxrees> not against the inputs
[18:28:29] <Robdgreat> well damn
[18:28:31] <robertmaxrees> against the form itself.
[18:28:46] <robertmaxrees> and the properties inside of "rules" should correspond with the name attributes in the form.
[18:32:01] <Robdgreat> the names and ids nearly all coincided, so that would have revealed itself quickly when only one field didn't work right
[18:32:04] <Robdgreat> or two or whatever
[18:32:18] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out that you need to use the names since people confuse that all the time.
[18:34:26] <Robdgreat> still screwing something up. Each tab out yields a Uncaught TypeError: e[d].call is not a function
[18:34:29] <Robdgreat> stupid min
[18:34:41] <Robdgreat> that's amazingly uninformative to me
[18:34:49] <robertmaxrees> actually, i can guess.
[18:34:55] <robertmaxrees> did you include the additional methods file?
[18:35:00] <Robdgreat> no
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> make sure you include that after the fact
[18:35:40] <robertmaxrees> like, after the validate plugin
[18:35:55] <Robdgreat> yeah
[18:36:01] <Robdgreat> didn't realize. Thanks Obama
[18:36:19] <cangelosx> what's a good way to fire an even immediately when user selects an option from a dropdown? $.change() only fires when element loses focus
[18:36:43] <robertmaxrees> click
[18:37:02] <robertmaxrees> maybe input?
[18:37:09] <cangelosx> what if user clicks the same option currently selected?
[18:37:26] <Robdgreat> you can check for that
[18:38:04] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:38:11] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx change works fine here.
[18:38:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/7mc8uyzx/
[18:38:20] <robertmaxrees> fires immediately whey they choose an option.
[18:38:20] <cangelosx> as soon as option is selected?
[18:39:15] <cangelosx> never mind, I'm a moron
[18:39:22] <cangelosx> It's actually a text input
[18:39:27] <robertmaxrees> input
[18:39:27] <cangelosx> don't ask me why I didn't pick up on that
[18:39:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7mc8uyzx/2/
[18:39:57] <cangelosx> basically I have a text box that you enter a serial number into, and has a few select boxes underneath it
[18:40:04] <cangelosx> problem is this, though:
[18:40:38] <cangelosx> when the text input changes, app checks the input for certain criteria, then displays an alert if something is wrong
[18:40:50] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: I added it and included it and it's loading but I'm still getting the same error
[18:41:06] <cangelosx> so if user enters invalid input and the input loses focus by virtue of selecting the dropdown box
[18:41:06] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat so it's jqvalidate, additionalmethods, then your file?
[18:41:18] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx right, you want the input event.
[18:41:18] <cangelosx> the alert dialog appears underneath the dropdown menu
[18:41:24] <robertmaxrees> showed you an example.
[18:41:35] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: problem is I can't use input since I don't know when the user is done typing
[18:41:37] <Robdgreat> jqvalidate and additionalmethods are in the head of my file
[18:41:45] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx then you want change.
[18:41:46] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:41:56] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat and they're being loaded in the right order?
[18:41:59] <Robdgreat> sure
[18:42:05] <robertmaxrees> "sure" isn't helpful heh
[18:42:08] <robertmaxrees> and your file is being loaded after them?
[18:42:37] <Robdgreat> it's an affirmative answer
[18:42:45] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: right, but problem is if alert dialog pops because user clicked on dropdown, dropdown appears over dialog
[18:42:49] <cangelosx> the dialog is a bootstrap modal
[18:42:56] <robertmaxrees> sorry - "sure" is usually used as a "i think so but i'm not positive" answer.
[18:43:06] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx so what's the problem you're trying to fix?
[18:43:09] <Robdgreat> I meant it more like "of course"
[18:43:13] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat okay.
[18:43:23] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:43:26] <Robdgreat> since they're being loaded in the head of my file, I guess that means it's being loaded after
[18:43:43] <Robdgreat> I'm not sure I understand the distinction
[18:43:46] <robertmaxrees> i think i see the issue.
[18:43:52] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: if i steal focus from dropdown back to input, would the dropdown close?
[18:44:02] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[18:44:11] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx you'll need to experiment with it.
[18:44:13] <cangelosx> or even steal it to the modal dialog
[18:44:22] <cangelosx> i kind of answered my own question
[18:44:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:44:30] <cangelosx> just needed to do it outloud i gess
[18:44:35] <cangelosx> guess*
[18:44:39] <robertmaxrees> rubber duck debugging.
[18:45:04] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat what happens if you set onKeyUp to false?
[18:45:06] <robertmaxrees> same error?
[18:45:17] <robertmaxrees> because IIRC, onKeyUp takes "false" or a function.
[18:45:43] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, another rule is busted.  so i'd need to see all of them.
[18:47:41] <Robdgreat> well, changing it to false revealed another error: how are you meant to represent an input whose name has square brackets in json?
[18:47:51] <Robdgreat> it's choking on name[first]
[18:48:06] <robertmaxrees> 'name\[first\]' maybe?
[18:48:21] <robertmaxrees> if that's a string.
[18:48:29] <robertmaxrees> like, context is important heh.
[18:48:40] <robertmaxrees> since json isn't javascript.
[18:49:06] <Robdgreat> heh
[18:49:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:49:22] <cangelosx> focus isnt working
[18:49:30] <cangelosx> so I had to do $('*').blur()
[18:49:32] <cangelosx> : (
[18:49:36] <robertmaxrees> D:
[18:49:40] <cangelosx> i know
[18:49:53] <robertmaxrees> something seems amiss, but ok.
[18:50:01] <cangelosx> i mean, you can try it
[18:50:08] <cangelosx> chrome related issue, it seems
[18:50:22] <cangelosx> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10851882/close-a-select-dropdown-list-programatically-with-javascript-jquery
[18:50:38] <robertmaxrees> ah that.
[18:51:31] <cangelosx> it's as clean as a sloppy second, but you do what you gotta do I guess
[18:52:32] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[18:54:48] <serend> Any one have any idea why this line wont work: url : "/lib/upload.php?type=1&client=85&key=308036" within a function
[18:55:01] <serend> but any other number within the key variable works without any issues
[18:55:09] <robertmaxrees> literally not enough information.
[18:55:18] <robertmaxrees> that looks like an object property.
[18:55:27] <serend> http://pastebin.com/A52CftYM
[18:55:42] <serend> heres the script sorry - i was prefacing before posting the script
[18:55:48] <robertmaxrees> so what isn't it doing?
[18:56:23] <serend> its using plupload script to upload documents to a local storage
[18:56:38] <serend> litteraly any other number works within the key except for 308036
[18:56:42] <serend> making no sense to me
[18:56:52] <robertmaxrees> define "works"?
[18:56:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:57:03] <serend> the pastebin I set it manually to 9999999 and it uploads
[18:57:18] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab and see what you're getting back.
[18:57:25] <serend> the upload.php file creates a folder and saves the files within the folder
[18:57:25] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a server-side issue.
[19:03:03] <serend> okay looks like an issue with php and some sort of string conversation...wierd
[19:03:39] <robertmaxrees> conversion?
[19:04:21] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: mind if I pm you the url to the page in question?
[19:04:32] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[19:04:39] <Robdgreat> nvm
[19:04:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather you just send it to the channel.
[19:05:28] <Robdgreat> and I respect that
[19:07:59] <robertmaxrees> i really think your problem is something in your config somewhere.
[19:08:06] <robertmaxrees> something simple.
[19:08:10] <robertmaxrees> hence why i asked to see it :\
[19:08:12] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[19:08:59] <Robdgreat> I thought jsfiddle offered a list of resources you could pull in from a menu
[19:09:07] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[19:09:13] <robertmaxrees> click the gear icon next to "javascript"
[19:09:54] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[19:10:01] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat https://jsfiddle.net/6qqw3nmg/
[19:10:05] <robertmaxrees> this has all those assets included.
[19:10:10] <robertmaxrees> can just update your html and js.
[19:14:05] <Robdgreat> https://jsfiddle.net/aqg05dh6/1/
[19:14:57] <robertmaxrees> okay. so how do I trigger your bug?
[19:15:32] <Robdgreat> I thought just tab through the form
[19:15:32] <robertmaxrees> because it seems to work here.
[19:15:41] <robertmaxrees> on.
[19:15:47] <robertmaxrees> oh. heh, try editing a field.
[19:15:49] <robertmaxrees> tabbign out.
[19:15:57] <robertmaxrees> then go back, delete it, and go on,
[19:16:33] <Robdgreat> ah
[19:16:48] <Robdgreat> hm
[19:16:59] <robertmaxrees> did you want it to validate when something loses focus?
[19:17:13] <Robdgreat> I'd like it to validate onkeyup
[19:17:29] <robertmaxrees> so you want an error for every keypress until the user gets it right?
[19:17:45] <Robdgreat> possibly
[19:17:49] <Robdgreat> not my reqs
[19:17:51] <Robdgreat> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:17:57] <Robdgreat> I just do as I'm told
[19:18:04] <robertmaxrees> so is that a yes or...?
[19:18:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:18:08] <Robdgreat> heh
[19:18:15] <robertmaxrees> because you can define a function for onkeyup
[19:18:29] <Robdgreat> yes, I wasn't kidding when I said I'd like it to validate onkeyup
[19:18:39] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/15103600
[19:18:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying you were kidding - the "possibly" was vague heh.
[19:18:52] <robertmaxrees> either way, that's what yuou want.
[19:19:37] <Robdgreat> heh
[19:19:59] <robertmaxrees> at least, i'm guessing.
[19:20:36] <Robdgreat> I may be able to get away with this, which I'd prefer
[19:20:47] <Robdgreat> I just got "I see validation messages, could you make them red?"
[19:20:53] <Robdgreat> yes, yes I can.
[19:21:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[19:21:15] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[19:21:19] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[19:21:27] <robertmaxrees> :) getting close then!
[19:21:39] <Robdgreat> what he initially requested was a green check mark to appear once a field validates
[19:21:57] <Robdgreat> but if merely showing an error onblur will suffice, I refuse to argue
[19:22:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:22:13] <Robdgreat> heh
[19:22:20] <robertmaxrees> and in the future, you'll estimate your time smarter :)
[19:22:49] <Robdgreat> I'm learning. estimating time is the single biggest reason my dreams of working for myself over the last 10 of so years never panned out before
[19:22:56] <Robdgreat> *or so
[19:23:09] <robertmaxrees> i'mn going to guess your problem is you're always way under, right?
[19:23:13] <Robdgreat> yeah
[19:23:19] <robertmaxrees> always multiply by 3.
[19:23:21] <robertmaxrees> like, always.
[19:23:55] <Robdgreat> so in the rules object there's meant to be name[first] and name[last] but I removed them, but they'll need to go back
[19:24:07] <Robdgreat> any insight on how that should appear?
[19:24:09] <robertmaxrees> 'name\[first\]'
[19:24:10] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[19:24:17] <Robdgreat> I did when you suggested it before :/
[19:24:19] <robertmaxrees> with quotes around it.
[19:24:22] <Robdgreat> yeah
[19:24:25] <robertmaxrees> then update the fiddle and show me.
[19:24:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:24:47] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[19:24:57] <robertmaxrees> try just 'name[first]'
[19:24:59] <robertmaxrees> with the quotes.
[19:25:01] <robertmaxrees> no escaping.,
[19:26:39] <Robdgreat> https://jsfiddle.net/aqg05dh6/3/
[19:30:29] <Robdgreat> I tried name[first], 'name[first]', 'name\[first\]'
[19:30:36] <robertmaxrees> the first one will never work fwiw.
[19:30:38] <robertmaxrees> that'll always error.
[19:30:39] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:30:50] <Robdgreat> yeah, I learned that really quickly
[19:31:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:31:02] <Robdgreat> heh
[19:32:03] <robertmaxrees> so a few valiudation rules straight up don't work.
[19:32:04] <robertmaxrees> but others do.
[19:32:40] <robertmaxrees> have you noticed that?
[19:33:11] <Robdgreat> yeah, wasn't sure if I just screwed something up or if the rules were bad
[19:33:42] <robertmaxrees> that screams invalid markup to me.
[19:35:09] <robertmaxrees> suddenly it starts working at email, but username is busted.
[19:38:29] <robertmaxrees> got it.
[19:38:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aqg05dh6/5/
[19:39:10] <robertmaxrees> phone: 'required',
[19:39:11] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[19:39:20] <robertmaxrees> the object assumes you're going to also pass a rule of some kind.
[19:40:09] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat ^
[19:40:28] <Robdgreat> hm ok
[19:43:42] <Robdgreat> how about when combined with another rule?
[19:43:51] <robertmaxrees> see the other cases that work?
[19:43:53] <Robdgreat> like in the case of zip code and email
[19:43:55] <robertmaxrees> where you specify the rule?
[19:44:05] <robertmaxrees> See how those work fine?
[19:44:10] <Robdgreat> yeah
[19:44:15] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[20:02:22] <Robdgreat> then somehow in the page it doesn't work m(
[20:02:48] <robertmaxrees> any errors or anything?
[20:03:29] <Robdgreat> oh, zip code works yay
[20:03:53] <Robdgreat> no, errors are forbidden
[20:03:56] <Robdgreat> far too informative
[20:05:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:05:22] <Robdgreat> heh
[20:15:50] * Robdgreat validates his markup for shiggles
[20:16:34] <Robdgreat> all good
[20:39:40] <Robdgreat> luffly. confirm password isn't working
[23:11:09] <BenderRodriguez> who called
[23:19:58] * Robdgreat invites someone to bite BenderRodriguez's shiny metal ass
