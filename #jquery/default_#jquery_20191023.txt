[05:48:57] <caliel> good morning #jquery
[05:50:43] <caliel> https://pastebin.com/gLzU6Utv
[05:51:44] <caliel> I need help here - In the $().each() code, I need that the function is executed "in order". For example, if the user has to update its credentials *and* its profile, the order has to be credentials->profile (the code popups a modal with a form).
[05:52:38] <Cork> caliel: crupdate uses ajax, so by definition it is async
[05:52:49] <Cork> meaning you can't use each if they need to wait for each one to be done
[05:53:14] <Cork> instead you need to have a recursive loop so the done callback from ajax can trigger the next element in the loop
[05:54:25] <caliel> that would mean *not* location.reload() in the last .done() callback?
[05:55:19] <Cork> if the requested element goes away from the list after the ajax call it can still be tehre
[05:55:20] <Cork> *there
[05:55:38] <Cork> if they need to remember what is doen, then no that isn't possible
[05:55:57] <Cork> but the important part is you need to wait to process the next element in the list untill the callbacks are done
[05:56:05] <caliel> Cork: what about using .first() ?
[05:56:09] <Cork> else they will just loop over all of them before the first dialog shows up
[05:56:22] <caliel> Cork: yes, that's what happens now.
[05:56:24] <Cork> if you replace each with first, so you just process one of them sure
[05:56:43] <Cork> caliel: ya, that is caused by the mix of sync and async code
[05:56:54] <caliel> Ok because, for example, if the user needs to change credentials (i.e. credentials expired), I need to reload the page and logout before doing something else.
[05:56:58] <Cork> meaning if you need to process more then one element, you must make the look async
[05:57:09] <caliel> Cork: I was trying with .promises and .when.apply, but I cannot achieve the goal though.
[05:57:17] <Cork> won't help you
[05:57:21] <Cork> you must stop using .each
[05:57:29] <Cork> as it by definition is sync
[05:58:06] <Cork> let me give you some psudo code
[05:58:08] <caliel> Cork, no as you can see, the code just popups a modal. At the moment, I have an user to be forced to renew credentials at first access, relog-in, edit the profile, add company info and so on... everything one after one.
[05:59:26] <caliel> Cork: yes, thank you. .each() is not a good solution, but I needed to access the *[data-rel^="crud-popup"] element(s) - I have a popups.html.twig that checks for missing stuff to force the user with a modal, so the <div data-rel="crud-popup"> will be in sequence.
[06:00:19] <Cork> caliel: https://jsfiddle.net/0fp3nzoq/
[06:00:35] <Cork> line 1 can be replaced by what comes after to make it support async calling
[06:01:04] <Cork> any form of .each can't make that work, as it expects to when the function exits it process the next element in the list
[06:01:29] <Cork> while the second solution has a next() function you call for the next element to start processing
[06:01:45] <Cork> and with that afk - lunch
[06:01:56] <caliel> Cork: have a good lunch and thank you for your time.
[09:21:42] <IamTrying> $('#barcode').on('input',function(e){ alert(1); }); - How to collect the 500 characters after the entire input is complete from Barcode reader? currently it is spamming for every inputs
[09:29:40] <Cork> IamTrying: use change, though that will only fire when focus is lost
[09:30:02] <Cork> there isn't a good way to know "user has stopped typing"
[09:30:09] <Cork> you can only guess
[09:30:31] <Cork> an option is to use something like a setTimeout and wait for no input in say 150ms
[09:30:52] <IamTrying> Cork: Barcode reader always have focus on that input field. So i am trying with some timer. like 3 second later read the random large string. Barcode is like random 32-bit or 64-bit or large..
[09:31:01] <IamTrying> approximately takes 2 to 3 seconds
[09:42:13] <nnyby> hmmm... who is responsible for the jquery ui infrastructure? https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues
[09:51:02] <Cork> nnyby: good question, noone i've been able to get in contact with the last few weeks
[09:51:32] <Cork> and yes it is well known that download.jqueryui.com has been down for a while
[09:52:12] <Cork> first time i saw a question about it was about a month ago
[09:53:26] <Cork> wow was longer then i remembered
[09:53:28] <nnyby> i emailed the JS foundation but haven't gotten a reply about this issue yet
[09:53:41] <Cork> its been down for 6 weeks
[09:54:03] <Cork> nnyby: ya, contacted on irc, email github no response anywhere
[09:54:21] <Cork> hence why i question if it is ever going to come up again
[09:55:14] <nnyby> they should at least give people to chance to take over and help
[09:55:19] <Cork> nnyby: there is a third party backup link on https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/371
[09:55:23] <Cork> might do what you need
[09:55:45] <Cork> nnyby: jquery ui has been dying for yerars
[09:56:13] <Cork> widget development has more or less been dead sinse 2014
[10:19:43] <undefined_bob> but why?
[10:20:08] <Cork> why development died or why the server is down?
[10:23:31] <undefined_bob> why it died
[10:23:52] <undefined_bob> I mean, it seems like many people liked and used the ui
[10:23:57] <Cork> the development died cause contributors and there for development dried up
[10:24:09] <Cork> ya, it has user, but very few contributors
[10:24:23] <nnyby> there are plenty of open pull requests :P https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls
[10:24:32] <undefined_bob> mhm thats sad
[10:24:39] <nnyby> it's open source, so as long as people want to help, development doesn't need to die
[10:25:14] <nnyby> if we knew who to get in contact with we can just keep this repo going.. or maybe i'll fork it.
[10:25:17] <Cork> ya, but comments there is from the blog post when jquery-ui dropped all none released widgets
[10:25:31] <Cork> and that was a lot of widgets that was on the way
[10:25:54] <Cork> but most of them had been stagnated for years at the time of the post
[13:00:48] <Ownix> What happens if you calle jquery ui sortable TWICE?
[13:01:09] <robertmaxrees> probably just reinitializes.
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> easy enough tesrt.
[13:01:14] <robertmaxrees> *test
[13:02:30] <robertmaxrees> Why do you ask?
[13:07:05] <Ownix> Because my code is going to have to run it more than once thanks to some initialization quirks with AJAX and a third party library I use.
[13:07:12] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:07:16] <robertmaxrees> initiali
[13:07:22] <robertmaxrees> *initialization quirks"?
[13:07:29] <robertmaxrees> mind being a little more specific?
[13:11:07] <Ownix> Its complicated. I use jQuery datatables editor. A paid editor for jquery datatables. I also use Select2. I also use a third party plugin for datatables editor that lets you defined the editor fields as select2 controls. I need to make my select2 tags sortable. When my editor dialog opens, it has to use ajax to fetch the tag data from the server so I have to wait until theres a success and then I can initialize the tags as
[13:11:07] <Ownix> sortable. If the editor dialog opens, and there are no tags, I have to wait until a tag is added to call sortable.
[13:11:49] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:11:53] <Ownix> Its just complicated. There are many lifecycles of shit going on, datatables editor is creating and destroying itself when the dialog opens, things are sometimes fetched with ajax before declaring sortable, I notice the select2 editor plugin seems to call the "create" method twice
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're pretty deep into it.  otherwise i'd suggest rethinking your strategy.  are you using jqui just for sortable?
[13:12:55] <Ownix> Yes.
[13:12:59] <robertmaxrees> :|
[13:13:14] <Ownix> You can customize the jqui DL to only include sortable.
[13:13:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd find a standalone sortable widget then.
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> you're still including a bunch of other boilerplate to support it.
[13:13:28] <Ownix> https://jqueryui.com/download/
[13:13:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:13:32] <Ownix> Right
[13:13:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm well familiar ;)
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out.
[13:13:49] <Ownix> But its the best, and im already using jquery, I might use the other UI parts eventually too
[13:14:01] <robertmaxrees> :/
[13:14:05] <Ownix> And I found support and code snippets for Select2 + jqui sortable
[13:14:09] <Ownix> So its more "supported"
[13:14:22] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> "more support" than what?
[13:14:43] <Ownix> It "just works" its not worth using something lighter to save a few kilobytes and then have to spend 10x as long trying to make it work and customize it
[13:15:18] <robertmaxrees> it wouldn't take 10x as long lol but alright :)
[13:15:18] <Ownix> "more support" than random billy bob joe's super ultra light weight sortable library
[13:15:21] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[13:15:37] <Ownix> Yeah I dont need luck
[13:15:47] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:15:48] <Ownix> I need to re-write this with a modern framework
[13:16:12] <Ownix> At first we though jquery DT Editor would be a good purchase to help us rapidly create a nice CRUD app
[13:16:26] <Ownix> But then the other feature requests came for us.. tags, and custom controls and shit
[13:16:40] <Ownix> So now its DT Editor + a bunch of supporting libraries and plugins
[13:17:46] <Ownix> So honestly if jquery sortable is drop-in and it just works right out of the box and theres other people ding this exact scenario and sharing code snippets it makes the most sense to go this route does it not?
[13:18:02] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't heh
[13:18:24] <robertmaxrees> but meh.  your project :)
[13:21:09] <Ownix> Why doesnt it
[13:21:14] <Ownix> Its an internal intranet app.
[13:22:00] <Ownix> It seems to me like a lot of devs are of the mind that the app they are building is Facebook or Google and that its going to get 1,000,000 hits per day
[13:22:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:22:10] <Ownix> And it often leads to horrible overly complex design choices
[13:22:41] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a tool we have at my place.  you're basically building a bunch of technical debt by piecemealing together like this.  sounds like maybe you need to do some discovery to figure out what you actually need to build out and have a light roadmap.
[13:22:48] <robertmaxrees> but like i said - your project :)
[13:25:15] <Ownix> Well its "done", so at this point we have the finished product so discovery is no longer needed. A re-write at this point would be better I think.
[13:25:35] <Ownix> A modern framework would allow me to write more modular code and not need to bring in do-it-all things like jquery
[13:25:47] <Ownix> And also it would be easier to test.
[13:26:11] <Ownix> Also, You can do discovery all day. Nothing stops a last minute or additional feature.
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:26:25] <robertmaxrees> chill, yo.
[13:26:30] <Ownix> Honestly I could drop the whole drag and drop thing and make the records sortable another way
[13:26:41] <Ownix> I just figured it would super consistent.
[13:26:49] <robertmaxrees> i've got over 10 years in this game.  i get it.  no need to get condescending with me.
[13:26:59] <robertmaxrees> like I said - your project :)
[13:27:23] <Ownix> I have 5+ and "good luck :)" and "butmeh. your project :)" is SUPER condescending
[13:27:38] <robertmaxrees> don't intend it to be.
[13:27:43] <robertmaxrees> just trying to move on from the subject.
[13:28:30] <Ownix> Well maybe im not asking the way I should be, can you give me some reasons or refute so I can perhaps learn? I think I did a good job of explaining my issue and why I made the choice I made
[13:28:47] <Ownix> So far I have just been told im wrong, and that its my project and good luck
[13:30:01] <robertmaxrees> i tried to talk about that but you got incredibly defensive and shut me down.  plus you said the project is "done" and you seem to already have a vision about where to head next - a rewrite is a really smart choice here imo.
[13:31:22] <Ownix> You are right about the tech debt
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> i always pick solutions not based on just the initial feature set, but on the problem domain i'm solving for and with an eye for fast-follows.
[13:31:51] <Ownix> Its showing its ugly head when I have to add things like sortable, and the path to do so is not clear thanks to DataTables and all the glue.
[13:32:03] <Ownix> what is fats-follows
[13:32:07] <Ownix> fast*
[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> right - stuff like datatables and jquery ui come with inherent lock-in where the expectation is that you'll build on those platforms and not deviate.
[13:32:56] <robertmaxrees> and "fast-follow" means "feature requests that'll come just after release"
[13:33:03] <Ownix> Yes, and its been challenging to have to conform
[13:33:23] <Ownix> Okay, thats a good term for that. I will have to remember that
[13:33:24] <Ownix> Can you give an example on picking a solution for a problem domain?
[13:33:35] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty nebulous question.
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> can you be more specific?
[13:35:05] <Ownix> Well, so as developers we know the problem. Our boss comes to us and tells us to build X. He might say it "needs excel export" and it "needs to allow users to enter data" and maybe even more detailed "the screen needs to allow the user to sort a list of items and save that new order"
[13:35:36] <Ownix> How do you translate that into a problem domain, and then pick a solution
[13:35:52] <Ownix> ANd what type is the solution in this case? A front-end framework?
[13:37:08] <robertmaxrees> heh, so your first issue is you have a manager coming at you with specifics - you should've been involved in the decision making process well before then.
[13:37:37] <Ownix> I try to be, but there are a lot of layers. I am just a dev in a big org.
[13:38:17] <robertmaxrees> heh, all of our engineers are devs in a big org as well - we deliberately structure things so they're involved early.
[13:39:11] <robertmaxrees> my second piece of advice would be to consider things like "will we need to iterate quickly?" or “will things change at the last minute?”
[13:39:26] <robertmaxrees> those will help dictate if you should, say, use something like react or vue.
[13:39:42] <Ownix> Things ALWAYS change at the last minute.
[13:39:49] <Ownix> here
[13:39:58] <Ownix> And at my last couple jobs.
[13:40:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we used to have that problem.
[13:40:19] <robertmaxrees> do you have any project managers on staff?
[13:40:25] <Ownix> The customer says jump, the sales people jump and eventually the devs have to start working quickly
[13:40:25] <Ownix> No
[13:40:30] <Ownix> Im the sole developer in my department
[13:40:37] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[13:40:39] <Ownix> The rest are sysadmins and operational specialist
[13:40:41] <robertmaxrees> you need project managers.
[13:40:59] <Ownix> Other departments have teams of devs with a PM, but the PMs are not always super good at their jobs
[13:41:14] <Ownix> My boss functions as the PM to me technically
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your org isn’t enabling them.
[13:41:31] <Ownix> He prioritizes my work, meets with the customers, works with me for estimates, etc
[13:41:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you’re fighting against a broken system.
[13:43:02] <Ownix> Yeah
[13:43:18] <Ownix> I notices you mentioned react and vue specifically, but never anything like Angular?
[13:43:39] <robertmaxrees> no particular reason for those.
[13:44:16] <robertmaxrees> just that they’re examples.  though i would argue angular is rarely a good solution unless you have a lot of staff that’s familiar with java, since it’s heavily java framework inspired.
[13:44:54] <Ownix> My boss would allow me to rewrite when I get some downtime, but as long as we get the exact same features as before. Which might be a little tough since DataTables editor is very feature right. We got a lot of features out of the box the second we wired it up. Like multi-row editing for example. So not only would I be re-writing the ap, but id also be trying to find a good table control for <insert framework> and possibly
[13:44:54] <Ownix> creating DTE features anew.
[13:45:21] <Ownix> I was an Angular 1.x expert, but 2+ is alien to me.
[13:46:05] <Ownix> I did the heroes tutorial, I like how testable it is, I like the ecosystem of components available, I like how its built on top TypeScript (im a C# dev)
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> heh, your leadership should be setting aside time for rewrites.
[13:48:34] <robertmaxrees> and the cool thing about those rewrites is that you have a much better handle on what you need to build.
[13:51:00] <Ownix> Yes its nice knowing the exact spec right off the bat.
[13:51:13] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[13:51:22] <Ownix> I know people love the multi-row editing, that will be the hardest part
[13:51:40] <Ownix> robertmaxrees: https://editor.datatables.net/examples/simple/multiRow.html
[13:51:51] <Ownix> Shift or ctrl+click rows, and then click edit
[13:52:11] <Ownix> The dialog will do a delta and show you what has differing data, it will show you what doesnt. And you can save to the server in one go
[13:52:22] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[13:52:24] <robertmaxrees> *ok?
[13:52:36] <robertmaxrees> sorry - did you need help
[13:52:37] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:52:40] <Ownix> Seems like a hard feature to re-write in any of the major frameworks right?
[13:52:49] <Ownix> Just spit-balling
[13:52:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:52:55] <robertmaxrees> that’s pretty easy.
[13:53:07] <Ownix> rly? Is there a super good Angular table out there right now?
[13:53:12] <Ownix> Er or react or vue
[13:53:27] <robertmaxrees> heh, that’s getting enough in the weeds that i’d point you to one of those channels.
[13:53:51] <Ownix> Server-side also. I think thats important to mention. My table is 100% server side. All sorting, filtering and paging is an HTTP call. So the table is lighting fast and data is sent down on demand.
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> but even with just, say, backbone that would be pretty easy.
[13:54:35] <Ownix> Did you just say backbone? https://i.imgur.com/WuzAVaw.jpg
[13:54:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:55:01] <Ownix> Youre showing those 10+ years of dev Robert
[13:55:09] <robertmaxrees> I still use backbone today.
[13:58:17] <Ownix> Is it still in active development?
[13:59:36] <robertmaxrees> looks like it might be getting mothballed soon.  last commit was back in feb.
[14:00:06] <robertmaxrees> we’ve got stuff in production that uses it.  upcoming projects won’t, but that’s for later :)
[14:39:42] <Ownix> robertmaxrees: I thought KnockoutJS was kind of the evolution/successor of Backbone
[14:39:59] <Ownix> From what I remember, this was when I started developing professionally back in 2013
[14:41:50] <robertmaxrees> I just think of it as another approach.
[14:44:50] <robertmaxrees> plus knockout is more “batteries included”.  backbone just gives you some structure.
[16:12:03] <devOops> what is a microservice?
[16:22:07] <robertmaxrees> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices
[16:23:33] <devOops> how can i do i create a microservice with jquery to optimize my application?
[16:23:57] <robertmaxrees> you cannot.
[16:24:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn’t meant for server-side.
[16:24:35] <devOops> what do you mean?
[16:24:45] <devOops> javascript works on server side
[16:24:47] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a DOM manipulation library.
[17:06:13] <devOops> oh
