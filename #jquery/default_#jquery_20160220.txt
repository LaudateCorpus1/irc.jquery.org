[00:54:07] <Shai-Tan> when getting a response from a ajax call, I have  success: function(response) {.. How do I get what is in response?
[00:54:40] <Shai-Tan> the return string is json
[00:59:39] <arc_> Shai-Tan response is accessible as a variable name inside the success callback
[01:01:13] <arc_> but if you're on jquery 1.8+ you're supposed to use done instead of success
[01:55:33] <nytek> Hello. Only if I could, would somebody help me please? In my "doEquals()" function, it seems only one out of the three if-else cases in question works. One of them is totally ignored by the interpreter, and the other doesn't produce any result. The alert function doesn't work in the doEquals() function at all, either; not anywhere. This is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/k7qvk4ur/24/
[02:59:17] <nytek> Hi. Would somebody please be able to help me? I've tried Chrome DevTools and JSLint here to no avail. I'm not sure where the problem is, but clicking the equals button runs the "doEquals()" function in my program. The problem is that it fails in two out of three if-else cases. And no alerts work in the function at all. But I see no errors in JS Lint or the console.  This is my code if anyone would help. I think someone with more experi

[03:09:52] <Uhkis> wow, that's the biggest fiddle i've ever seen
[03:12:57] <Uhkis> nytek: you have 2 buttons with the id bigButton
[03:15:51] <Uhkis> nytek: and no button with the id "equals"

[06:25:57] <Uhkis> Shai-Tan: it's all in the response variable
[06:26:48] <Shai-Tan> and that is an object
[06:27:28] <Shai-Tan> so, how do I see what is within the object?
[06:28:26] <Shai-Tan> ahh, got it
[06:28:29] <Shai-Tan> duh
[06:37:48] <Shai-Tan> and if I send an ajax request like $.ajax({ type: "post", url: "request.php", data: dataString, dataType: "json" ... Would I be correct in assuming the data would be available in $__POST in request.php?

[07:27:59] <mrbeans_23> hi, is there a strategy to have a jquery plugin return a value other than "this", but maintain chainability, i.e. the return value/s must be obtained somehow on an indirect way. :) thanks
[07:54:19] <printForever> still having issues with Select2 I can't get the tags to work via CustomAdapter... https://jsfiddle.net/yee64u1v/6/
[07:54:29] <printForever> there are no errors in the console
[07:54:44] <printForever> I've found nothing online...
[08:34:26] <Duikb00t> http://paste.ee/p/mDBW1  Can someone give me a suggestion how to do that
[08:35:02] <Duikb00t> I have on top : some filter, and below that a grid with thumbs.
[08:35:03] <printForever> youre trying to get an ID of an element, but you're asking for a CLASS attr
[08:35:29] <Duikb00t> Sorry I described it wrong :)
[08:35:37] <printForever> line 2 and 3
[08:35:39] <Duikb00t> the category variable is doing ok :)
[08:36:04] <Duikb00t> it contains now for example:   product_cat_10
[08:36:39] <printForever> what is line 5?
[08:36:44] <printForever> and 7?
[08:36:49] <Duikb00t> But based on that category variable I want to hide all others in #grid_products .thumbs.
[08:37:01] <printForever> you are trying to describe to jQuery what you want to do?
[08:37:09] <Duikb00t> Hahaha no :D
[08:37:20] <printForever> there is .find()
[08:37:22] <Duikb00t> Im looking for a way in jquery to find an elementByClassname and hide all others
[08:37:25] <printForever> and there is .hide()
[08:37:43] <Duikb00t> $('grid_produchts .thumbs').find(category);
[08:37:45] <printForever> https://api.jquery.com/find/
[08:38:18] <printForever> $(this).siblings().hide();
[08:38:24] <printForever> or something like that...
[08:41:09] <Duikb00t> printForever:  The siblings thing seems not to work
[08:41:46] <Duikb00t> Is there a way to hide all others except the selected ones?
[08:46:10] <printForever> Duikb00t: of course there is, but if you don't know jQuery, it is very unlikely someone here will write a solution for you...
[08:46:16] <printForever> sorry
[08:48:08] <Duikb00t> I im trying
[08:55:42] <Duikb00t> Thanks printForever  this works $('#grid_products .thumbs a').not('.'+category).hide();
[10:29:27] <noahmg123> When trying to use the HuffPost Pollster API with jQuery.ajax, I get this: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource..
[10:31:56] <shoky> noahmg123: that means their server doesn't support cross-domain ajax requests via CORS headers. but i see in their docs they support jsonp if you name the jsonp callback "pollsterCallback"
[10:32:20] <noahmg123> shoky: I actually was just trying that. Thanks.
[10:33:23] <noahmg123> shoky: how do I then get the data from the call?
[10:36:51] <_3by8> Can't get this to work: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/OMeJLj
[10:37:38] <shoky> noahmg123: http://jsbin.com/locawokayi/1/edit?js,output
[10:37:52] <noahmg123> shoky: thanks, looking now
[10:39:29] <taplar> _3by8: you don't have jquery included
[10:40:22] <_3by8> taplar: that's hilarious, thanks, it's not working on my development version though and I know I have jQuery included there.
[12:39:27] <prab_> is SciJS still a project of jquery?
[12:41:05] <snover> prab_: i have no idea what you are talking about, scijs has nothing to do with jquery as far as i know
[12:41:35] <prab_> it was on the idea page of gsoc 2015

[14:27:58] <Mithrandir_> Hello. I'm using colloquy on iOS and this is the only chan name I could remember. Anyone know how to /list in the app?
[14:29:47] <Mithrandir_> Or maybe I could just ask a philosophical web Dev question here.
[14:35:27] <Mithrandir_> Anyone home? Or is it too early/late?
[14:35:44] <jedimind> you can ask general webdev questions in #web
[14:35:51] <jedimind> if you want to ask some frontend specific ones, go to ##frontend
[14:36:17] <Mithrandir_> Nice. Thanks. It's actually a philosophical question about writing code.
[17:28:49] <RonRichie> damn it... can't even use the simplest jquery selectors, could someone tell what's wrong with this selector? https://jsfiddle.net/b1anptaL/ ?
[17:34:15] <shoky> RonRichie: none of the <div>'s are a first-child of their parent ;p
[17:34:57] <shoky> (because the <h1> is the first child)
[17:35:41] <shoky> you can use :first or $('div').first()  but it's best to use a class or maybe id
[17:36:43] <RonRichie> shoky  gotchaaaa:)) thanks
[18:18:11] <amikrop> To what should I set the width of a textarea, so it will span the same length as N typed (into the textarea) characters?
[18:18:22] <amikrop> N + 'em' didn't work (width ended up about double than what I needed)

[19:48:37] <Renari> This isn't really a jquery specific answer but I'm trying to bind a mutationobserver to an element on http://play.pokemonshowdown.com
[19:48:44] <Renari> https://gist.github.com/Renari/9b07c4847aad93abf894
[19:49:20] <Renari> like so, does anyone know why this mutationobserver will correctly log the element to the console but then do nothing when I change that element repeatedly?
[19:49:38] <Renari> I think it may have something to do with subtree maybe not working?
[20:21:24] <RonRichie> can someone help with this little event handler? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jWjWwP even though I put a text in the li when i submit it(on Enter key) it just adds an empty li... whats going on with this ? :-/
[20:24:48] <mkp> longshot, but anyone here know how to add a custom property to jquery datatable columns?
[20:24:50] <shoky> RonRichie: there's no .text property on dom elements
[20:24:58] <shoky> RonRichie: why not use jquery
[20:25:14] <mkp> i tried to find a datatables specific IRC, but doesn't look like that exists.
[20:25:56] <mkp> basically need a custom property i can check for when looping through the columns on responsive display
[20:26:54] <RonRichie> shoky damn it lol I was thinking of textContent but somehow typed it as `text`, I did use jquery and did this just fine, I was wondering how would I do it without jquery actually :)
[20:26:58] <renegadeandy> hey guys. I am trying to submit a form using   $('form').submit(); but it is not doing anything when the code runs - no errors. What could the problem be?
[20:27:14] <renegadeandy> I don’t know the specific name of the form, hence the $(‘form’) selector
[20:29:17] <mkp> is there a default action set up for the form?
[20:30:50] <renegadeandy> yeah : <form class="padding " id="edit_event_87" action="/events/87/activity_setup/activity_info" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
[20:30:54] <shoky> renegadeandy: could be many different problems.. e.g. there's a submit handler that's preventing the submit action.  you can try $('form')[0].submit()  to submit the first form without triggering submit handlers
[20:33:20] <renegadeandy> $(‘form’)[0].submit() is not doing anything either
[20:33:57] <shoky> hard to help further without seeing the problem
[20:35:00] <renegadeandy> my form has a submit button….could that be the problem?
[20:35:18] <shoky> nope
[20:36:32] <renegadeandy> This is the code : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b957b7b7f439a91d820a The js is tied to a html based menu.
[20:36:50] <shoky> uhm
[20:36:52] <renegadeandy> I want the form to submit if somebody presses on the menu, the move_to handler is called
[20:36:58] <shoky> you're appending a <form> to an <input> ? )
[20:37:00] <shoky> :)
[20:37:22] <renegadeandy> emm
[20:37:25] <renegadeandy> i want to add the input to the form?
[20:37:38] <shoky> you're doing the opposite
[20:38:47] <renegadeandy> ok….so?
[20:38:49] <renegadeandy> lol how!
[20:38:57] <renegadeandy> I am saying append this to the form?
[20:39:11] <renegadeandy> if thats not how you do this, how do i do it
[20:39:22] <shoky> a.appendTo(b)   means append a to b
[20:39:38] <shoky> i.e.  insert a to b, at the end
[20:40:10] <renegadeandy> ok , so in syntax terms?
[20:40:12] <shoky> you want either  $('form').append('<input>')  or  $('<input>').appendTo('form')
[20:41:55] <shoky> also uh why add a hidden input with no name?
[20:45:44] <renegadeandy> yep - you spotted the 2 problems
[20:45:53] <renegadeandy> infact you helped solve 3
[20:45:59] <renegadeandy> thank you very much - we are up and running
[20:46:49] <shoky> np
[21:13:21] <partyfavorites> can someone please go to http://partyfavor-ites.com  and click login button at top right and see the error being generated there? it's a redirect loop repeating a server username...i have never seen this
[21:24:50] <seeker63> wow just came on to see what is and this looks great
[21:26:12] <shoky> partyfavorites: the server keeps redirecting the request, adding /~reatingd  to the location each time
[21:27:08] <shoky> partyfavorites: also the https cert doesn't match the url
[21:27:34] <partyfavorites> how do i get the cert to match the url
[21:27:41] <partyfavorites> and why is this only happening for this one login link
[21:28:12] <shoky> you get a cert for the right url :)
[21:28:43] <shoky> and you'd have to check your server for that, it's not jquery or client related
[21:47:16] <Twirl> anyone using dropzone.js?
[21:48:31] <Twirl> partyfavorites: i really need to party now
[21:48:40] <partyfavorites> me too
[23:33:11] <Mark__> how do i execute this function from the beginning when the document loads,without clicking? $(‘.selector’).click($xw.eventHandler.onToggleCommentClick);
