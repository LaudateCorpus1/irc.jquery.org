[00:02:13] <asdf1231> isn't .load() a short hand for .on('load', func..... ?
[00:02:19] <systemfault> Yeah
[00:02:32] <systemfault> I always use .on for consistency..
[00:03:10] <ryanaz> asdf1231:  Why are you going through the hassle of hiding it upon load first instead of just showing it right away when they click it?
[00:03:28] <asdf1231> its ugly if they have a slow connection
[00:03:43] <asdf1231> so i want to add a spinner in there
[00:04:20] <ryanaz> gotcha
[00:04:28] <systemfault> asdf1231: If you really need to target people with slow connections, it might be worth using progressive/interlaced images
[00:04:30] <ryanaz> so if they're on dialup.. ;)
[00:05:20] <ryanaz> i'm sure it's just an example, i can see a lot of use for something like that in general... wait until loaded, then show it
[00:05:22] <ryanaz> pretty cool idea
[00:06:19] <ryanaz> back when I first started writing in C we did a similar thing writing draw to a frame buffer and then switch frame buffers once it was done drawing
[00:06:44] <systemfault> ryanaz: It's still used
[00:06:53] <systemfault> ryanaz: It's called double buffering
[00:06:57] <ryanaz> yah I imagine... just probably happens faster these days
[00:08:21] <ryanaz> i'm excited to find this channel...  i haven't had to learn a new langugage in a while, I want to start getting heavy into ajax .. jquery seems to handle a lot of basic necessities
[00:08:57] <systemfault> ryanaz: Yeah, it does make the DOM easier to use
[00:09:07] <ryanaz> systemfault: If you were building facebook (just an example) from the ground up today, would you build it on jquery framework or something of your own?
[00:09:40] <systemfault> ryanaz: I'd use jquery but wouldn't use it directly… I'd build a small abstraction over it.
[00:10:02] <ryanaz> so you'd take out the core functions you use from jquery?
[00:10:07] <ryanaz> instead of loading the whole thing?
[00:10:29] <systemfault> ryanaz: That way, if one day… (That's improbable) jQuery begins to suck.. I would be able to switch to something else easily
[00:10:34] <systemfault> No no no
[00:10:49] <systemfault> I wouldn't use jquery directly
[00:10:51] <ryanaz> oh you'd build a framework ontop of it...
[00:11:01] <systemfault> Not really a framework… but an abstraction
[00:11:26] <ryanaz> .. right, that's basically what I'm doing.. i have a layer that generates the code for me
[00:11:34] <systemfault> Good :)
[00:15:06] <ryanaz> systemfault:  basically my "abstraction layer" code is like this:   {dynamic.src=api/locations.cgi;switches=id_community;id=fbo_fuel_update_info_locations}
[00:15:10] <ryanaz> this generates  :  http://beta.stratfuel.com/test3.html
[00:15:32] <ryanaz> i have it in CGI though, the test3.html is a static I created from the dynamic generated code
[00:16:04] <ryanaz> .. hard to explain, but yah.. similar idea I'm sure
[00:16:27] <systemfault> Ah :P
[00:19:22] <ryanaz> <rant> anyone else here use godaddy ?   Why the hell do my open 'vim' get terminated every hour???
[00:19:49] <ryanaz> </rant>
[00:27:31] <asdf1231> http://jsfiddle.net/yAFP7/4/ when making an accordian, best way to re-adjust the scroll ?
[00:27:54] <asdf1231> so the 'item' expanding don't get scrolled off the view port
[00:29:38] <asdf1231> i guess the jsfiddle isn't all that great to see as an example since it lacks any real layout
[00:30:45] <asdf1231> but sometimes the item being clicked will get sucked up top (when the previous item collapses) then expand, but it'll pull it up enough so when the current clicked item expands half of it is off the view port
[00:31:58] <asdf1231> i'm trying to see if there's a way to do it without a jquery plugin for viewport stuff
[00:32:27] <asdf1231> or is there a way in jquery core to detect if a element is off the view port?
[00:33:41] <systemfault> ryanaz: Still using godaddy?
[00:33:48] <systemfault> ryanaz: You deserve to be spanked.
[00:33:49] <systemfault> :/
[00:33:51] <ryanaz> hah
[00:33:58] <ryanaz> where's the new place to be these days?
[00:35:15] <Back2Basics> ryanaz: anyplace with morals.  ( I say that but I'm still on godaddy becuase it's nice to have leeway with the company as a customer )
[00:35:17] <ryanaz> i have my own bare metal servers I use for my own stuff, but clients that bring me on to do small projects I've just always used godaddy cause it was easy.
[00:35:39] <asdf1231> godaddy is easy?
[00:35:59] <Back2Basics> asdf1231: NO it's Hard (I'm not being sarcastic)
[00:36:06] <ryanaz> ... well, I'm asking for where is a better linux hosting provider.. and nobody's saying..
[00:36:08] <asdf1231> forget any feelings about godaddy as a company, it's control panel UI is horrible enough to turn me away
[00:36:10] <Back2Basics> asdf1231: the file manager is 5 levels down.
[00:36:28] <Back2Basics> asdf1231: you have to constantly get past the upsell material
[00:36:35] <asdf1231> ya haha
[00:36:41] <ryanaz> asdf1231:  Who needs a control panel ui?  Once I get the unix # I'm good to go..
[00:36:48] <asdf1231> why are they advertising their own customers so heavily geez
[00:37:00] <asdf1231> ryanaz: dreamhost, but theyre west coast if that matters
[00:37:17] <systemfault> Godaddy sucks the US governement dick.
[00:37:19] <asdf1231> media temple , but more expensive
[00:37:20] <ryanaz> do they have similar national bandwidth considerations?
[00:37:27] <systemfault> We saw them supporting SOPA.
[00:37:45] <ryanaz> ... i'm thinking of killing all my godaddy stuff and moving everything to amazon cloud stuff.. thoughts?
[00:38:36] <tw2113> are you able to treat Amazon S3 as a server?
[00:38:55] <tw2113> eh, maybe the html/css/js aspect
[00:38:57] <ryanaz> tw2113:  they have virtual hosting now.. at least from what I can tell
[00:39:01] <tw2113> but not sure on anything like php
[00:39:09] <ryanaz> i haven't gone through the videos yet, I was going to do that next week
[00:39:47] <ryanaz> http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/
[00:40:43] <ryanaz> interesting right?  Or is this old news?
[00:42:59] <tw2113> *shrug*
[00:43:10] <tw2113> i don't use S3 for much other than a quick site backup
[00:43:39] <ryanaz> S3 is just the storage...
[00:43:44] <ryanaz> aws seems to be way way way more
[00:43:55] <ryanaz> but again, I haven't tried it yet
[00:44:01] <ryanaz> just looked at it, looks interesting
[00:44:36] <ryanaz> to spin up a website for free, and then just pay as it scales... seems like a good idea.  :)
[00:45:01] <ryanaz> and to be on one of the most robust world wide networks probably isn't too bad if an idea.
[00:45:28] <tw2113> granted, github acts like a host for static files too
[00:45:48] <tw2113> stranger things have happened

[00:57:25] <hyper_ch> hi there, I found some jquery addons that lets me collapse lists in categories. Then I also found another addon that should be able to un/check all checkboxes in a category. However I have not been able to make them work together.
[01:06:20] <thinkerbell> how do you style the size of jquery icons?
[01:06:46] <thinkerbell> hyper_ch, I think you should try jquery ui
[01:39:30] <aro> has anyone seen cases of where opera double submits on form posts that are picked up by .on() ?
[01:41:29] <thinkerbell> ahhh, I give up on jquery ui, I hate reading others css, its easier to write your own, than modify others
[01:43:09] <hyper_ch> thinkerbell: didn't you recommend me just a little while ago to use jquery ui?
[01:43:11] <systemfault> thinkerbell: I personally think that jquery is unusable for that reason
[01:43:37] <systemfault> Err
[01:43:40] <systemfault> SOrry
[01:43:46] <systemfault> jQueryUI
[01:43:57] <hyper_ch> but jquery ui has a few nice things
[01:43:57] <systemfault> jQuery itself is very good
[01:44:11] <thinkerbell> Hypah, well, for what you were asking for, its great
[01:44:17] <systemfault> hyper_ch: jQueryUI is wonderful… as long as you take it as it is
[01:44:20] <thinkerbell> hyper_ch, , well, for what you were asking for, its great
[01:44:48] <systemfault> hyper_ch: The second you think about modifying the css… you're fucked.
[01:44:54] <systemfault> (Sorry for the language)
[01:44:56] <thinkerbell> jquery is good for ui, but not styling, its easier to design styles on your own
[01:45:00] <hyper_ch> thinkerbell: actually, jquery ui doesn't help... but I found something else
[01:45:25] <hyper_ch> calendar widget, drag/drop sorting... those are nice things by jquery ui
[01:45:34] <systemfault> hyper_ch: Yeah
[01:45:37] <thinkerbell> hyper_ch, oh, sorry for the bad advice, I just saw on their site, they ad those things you asked for
[01:45:39] <hyper_ch> also tab switching
[01:45:45] <systemfault> hyper_ch: Try to modify the CSS though...
[01:45:51] <hyper_ch> thinkerbell: no need to be sorry :) you try to help :)
[01:45:56] <sacho> A drawback of jumping from 1.4 to 1.7 -> "Huh, what do you mean jquery has deferred?"
[01:46:01] <hyper_ch> s/try/tried/
[01:46:14] <systemfault> sacho: ? :)
[01:46:31] <systemfault> deferred is the best thing that ever happened to jQuery
[01:46:38] <sacho> yeah
[01:46:39] <systemfault> Damn they're powerful
[01:47:10] <thinkerbell> An couple hours ago, I thought to myself, you roll out a theme, and start designing, makes life easy, and is good for rapid development, but thing is, it restricts your creativity cause you have to work with whats given and you end up not trying to do things that you would otherwise
[01:47:29] <hyper_ch> systemfault: what is "deferred"?
[01:47:35] <sacho> can't you style the jquery ui elements manually?
[01:47:43] <sacho> rather than using their templating stuff
[01:47:47] <sacho> or is it even harder
[01:47:52] <systemfault> sacho: Not really.. you end up modifying the whole thing.
[01:48:06] <systemfault> sacho: Because all the widgets share the styles..
[01:48:16] <thinkerbell> sacho, yeah, sure but lots of the stuff relies on css, so you need to use it, but yeah, you can just edit.
[01:48:34] <systemfault> sacho: It's good when you want a unified look like for a CMS section...
[01:49:10] * sacho shrugs
[01:49:22] <sacho> good thing I never do styling
[01:49:30] <systemfault> sacho: Win! :D
[01:49:50] <thinkerbell> I wish you could auto play the tabs
[01:50:03] <sacho> oh cool, jquery also exposes the deferred chain caller with Callbacks
[01:50:18] <systemfault> sacho: You mean?
[01:50:31] <sacho> the callbacks object
[01:51:30] <thinkerbell> The jqueryui icons -you can't adjust size, although they are gonna add that feature soon, and the tabs, I saw some code to center then, but it didn't work for me
[01:55:33] <aro> does anyone know about opera and double form submissions when using .on()
[01:57:20] <sacho> "when using .on"?
[01:57:32] <sacho> are you talking about a click event, or something?
[02:00:17] <aro> yes
[02:00:28] <aro> i have a .on( 'click') listener
[02:00:33] <aro> which triggers a form submit
[02:00:38] <aro> in opera, it submits the form twice
[02:00:42] <aro> no other browser does
[02:01:19] <systemfault> Could you show us the code?
[02:01:26] <aro> yeah
[02:02:11] <aro> http://pastebin.com/dmbDdntV
[02:06:47] <systemfault> I can't see anything but the code itself is very difficult to follow :(
[02:07:30] <aro> ill explain it. the form '#SubmitPaymentForm' is submitted, and the else block is processed
[02:07:39] <aro> (line 95)
[02:07:53] <aro> it displays a lightbox with a confirmation message to submit payment
[02:08:16] <aro> the button to confirm payment is #SubmitPaymentFormOverride
[02:08:36] <aro> once they click that, it triggers #SubmitPaymentForm submit, with a passed parameter of bypassAndSubmit
[02:08:43] <aro> (line 69)
[02:08:56] <aro> that displays the message in the lightbox that payment has been submitted
[02:09:00] <aro> or is submitting rather
[02:09:29] <aro> that triggers #SubmitPaymentForm submit with a passed param of straightSubmit (line 65)
[02:09:44] <aro> this returns true, and then in turn allows the form to submit (defaultaction)
[02:09:51] <raj> how can I remove a div in 20 seconds?
[02:10:08] <systemfault> raj: with setTimeout?
[02:10:14] <aro> raj: setTimeout( function() { $('div').remove(); }, 20000 );
[02:10:23] <raj> i try not to mix pure js with jq though
[02:10:28] <aro> LOL
[02:10:31] <raj> there's no jq way?
[02:10:36] <aro> yeah there is
[02:10:40] <aro> its called setTimeout
[02:10:51] <raj> that's javascript
[02:10:54] <raj> builtin
[02:11:01] * aro facepalms
[02:11:02] <systemfault> raj: I guess you could use delay...
[02:11:11] <systemfault> raj: But setTimeout isn't really magic
[02:11:17] <aro> doesnt delay just use setTimeout
[02:11:31] <systemfault> aro: Indeed.
[02:11:36] <aro> thats pure js
[02:12:07] <aro> raj: why dont you write a new language?
[02:12:08] <systemfault> And delay is not a replacement for setTimeout as it doesn't give a way to cancel it
[02:13:10] <aro> anyways, any idea why that double submits in opera?
[02:13:15] <aro> it works perfectly in EVERY OTHER BROWSER
[02:13:22] <systemfault> aro: I believe you :P
[02:13:28] <aro> but unfortunately, i have to make it work in opera too
[02:13:32] <systemfault> aro: But I saw nothing obvious :(
[02:13:50] <aro> do all those functions natively work in opera?
[02:14:46] <aro> this guy has the same problem it seems: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3932365/jquery-opera-how-to-stop-submit
[02:14:55] <raj> can I make it fade out instead?
[02:15:34] <systemfault> raj: ……fadeout(timeinmilliseconds)....
[02:15:45] <aro> raj: $('div').fadeOut('slow', function() { $(this).remove(); } );
[02:15:50] <aro> i suggest you read the API
[02:15:54] <aro> its all there
[02:16:01] <systemfault> raj: jQuery's documentation isn't bad :)
[02:16:07] <raj> it's actually great
[02:16:08] <raj> some of the best
[02:16:21] <systemfault> Then Y U NO READ IT?
[02:16:22] <systemfault> :(
[02:16:25] <raj> but if I don't know what to look up, then it doesn't really help
[02:16:36] <aro> did you try google?
[02:16:50] <systemfault> raj: on the API, it would be in the Effects category
[02:16:51] <aro> google.com/search?q=jquery+fadeout
[02:17:02] <systemfault> http://api.jquery.com/
[02:17:21] <systemfault> See the "Effects" category in the left column
[02:17:49] <systemfault> (At the same time you'll see more nice things jquery can do)
[02:18:53] <aro> well i am at a loss
[02:19:06] <aro> maybe we can just block users that use opera
[02:19:10] <aro> since they are probably swedish anyways
[02:19:16] <aro> and wont have any money
[02:19:22] <systemfault> lol
[02:19:41] <aro> i meant ukraine
[02:19:44] <aro> not sweden
[02:19:50] <aro> swedes have a lot of money
[02:19:51] <aro> ukes dont
[02:20:20] <aro> they just have grain
[02:20:31] <aro> who wants to be paid in grain
[02:20:45] <systemfault> Hmmm.. someone who makes bread :P
[02:20:49] <ruethewhirled> Just set a global variable and don't submit if its already set
[02:20:50] <aro> i sold something on ebay to someone in ukraine
[02:20:55] <aro> needless to say, it didnt go well
[02:23:51] <raj> ok, what I'm trying to do isn't working
[02:23:55] <raj> it still just disappears
[02:23:59] <aro> then you are doing it wrong
[02:24:03] <aro> whats your code
[02:24:29] <sacho> aro, have you tried it with a simplified use case?
[02:24:32] <raj> setTimeout(function(){ $popup.fadeOut('slow'); $popup.remove()}, 5000)
[02:24:36] <aro> sacho: yes
[02:24:37] <sacho> simply insert an onclick which has preventdefault
[02:24:42] <aro> raj
[02:24:50] <aro> you are removing it before it finishes fading out
[02:24:59] <aro> the example i gave you passed that as a callback for fadeout
[02:25:03] <aro> you didnt listen
[02:25:15] <sacho> asynchronous execution is a bitch
[02:25:28] <raj> oh, I didn't notice that
[02:25:44] <aro> setTimeout(function(){ $popup.fadeOut('slow', function() { $popup.remove(); }), 5000)
[02:25:48] <aro> something like that
[02:26:00] <aro> second param of fadeout is a callback for after animation is complete
[02:26:12] <systemfault> raj: delay… dude
[02:26:19] <aro> sacho, hang on let me try
[02:26:55] <systemfault> $('roflmao').delay(20000).fadeOut('slow', function() { $(this).remove() }); something like that
[02:27:28] <raj> looks good
[02:27:31] <raj> and cleaner
[02:27:32] <raj> thanks systemfault
[02:28:24] <aro> well preventdefault works in opera on jsfiddle
[02:28:33] <aro> i just dont understand why my code works in every browser but opera
[02:29:02] <aro> hmm let me try one thing
[02:35:51] <aro> nope
[02:35:53] <aro> still doing it
[02:35:54] <aro> wtf
[02:38:01] <sacho> it works or doesn't?
[02:38:06] <aro> doesnt
[02:38:10] <aro> still double submitting
[02:38:15] <sacho> interesting
[02:38:21] <aro> im adding some debug server side to see if i can track what is being submitted with the form
[02:39:25] <sacho> odd that there doesn't seem to be any comment on the issue(via google)
[02:40:00] <systemfault> Normal! Nobody uses Opera!
[02:40:04] <systemfault> :/
[02:40:24] <sacho> yeah, I would be testing it already if I even had opera installed. ;)
[02:41:54] <aro> i know
[02:42:09] <aro> like i said, only people that use it are broke ass ukrainians
[02:44:12] <aro> well, the requests are two seconds apart.. so its not on the server
[02:44:23] <aro> so its definitely the browser that is doing it
[02:45:05] <aro> pissing me off
[02:50:42] <aro> i may have to just hack it and submit using .post
[03:00:16] <aro> sigh
[03:00:17] <aro> i give up
[03:15:30] <aro> its getting called twice
[03:15:30] <aro> why
[03:20:37] <aro> ahahahaha
[03:20:39] <aro> got it
[03:20:41] <aro> it was colorbox
[03:29:03] <anush> hi does any body know of a jquery plugin where one can select discrete values from available list..
[03:29:13] <anush> much like a range of chechboxes
[03:30:07] <anush> but i need something that masks the list of checkboxes
[03:41:00] <aro> I AM A GOLDEN GOD
[03:46:20] <raj> what's the official jquery.cookie plugin?
[04:29:02] <unik> hi all, is there any way to detect when a <object> has downloaded (like swf)
[04:52:17] <tomato> hi, what happens when you return the window object from global scope?
[04:54:53] <tomato> hi, what happens when you return the window object in global scope?
[04:54:55] <tomato> e.g., function bob { return window; }, bob();
[04:57:26] <Krinkle> tomato: what do you mean? What is there to happen
[04:57:45] <tomato> say you don't return the window object...
[04:57:56] <tomato> or extend the object
[04:58:04] <Krinkle> If you return the window object, it returns the window object
[04:58:20] <tomato> you're calling it from the window object
[04:58:25] <Krinkle> it's a global object, available to anything anywhere, unless a local variable by the same name exists
[04:58:32] <tomato> yes i know
[04:58:33] <Krinkle> yep
[04:58:50] <tomato> i see namespacing functions doing this
[04:58:52] <Krinkle> window.bob = function () { return this; } window.bob() will return window as well
[04:59:06] <tomato> they just extend the window and then return it back to the window...
[04:59:07] <Krinkle> foo = { bar: function () { return this; } };
[04:59:10] <Krinkle> foo.bar() returns foo
[04:59:15] <tomato> yes i know scope..
[04:59:17] <Krinkle> x = foo.bar; x(); returns window
[05:00:08] <Krinkle> quux = {}; foo.bar.call(quux); will return quux;
[05:00:20] <tomato> but function foo(bob) { var w = window; w.something = bob; return w}, foo() ?
[05:00:46] <Krinkle> I'm not sure what you're asking
[05:00:52] <Krinkle> objects are passed by reference
[05:00:57] <tomato> i'm asking why someone would do this
[05:01:08] <Krinkle> I don't know, why would you do that?
[05:01:14] <tomato> i didn't do that
[05:01:17] <Krinkle> looks like stupid code
[05:01:24] <Krinkle> you just did , kinda :P
[05:01:27] <Krinkle> is there a problem?
[05:01:43] <tomato> i'm reading through a well made namespacing function on a pretty good CMS
[05:01:55] <tomato> at least it looks like it's for namespacing
[05:02:42] <tomato> but i don't fully understand how.. seems like they extended the window object and then 'override' the window by returning it to itself...
[05:02:50] <tomato> i just don't really get what's going on.. lol
[05:03:05] <Krinkle> well, if you don't show any code, it's hard to guess what anything would do
[05:03:12] <Krinkle> can you link to something?
[05:03:35] <tomato> i'll throw it into pastebin
[05:05:57] <tomato> http://pastebin.com/PB149tDy
[05:06:03] <tomato> Krinkle, http://pastebin.com/PB149tDy
[05:06:33] <Krinkle> that looks like very stupid code written by someone who clearly knows shit about javascript.
[05:07:01] <tomato> i've seen another version of this used by someone else where foo was added to the String prototype
[05:07:20] <Krinkle> window.window is a circular reference
[05:07:34] <tomato> and it would've been window = window[this]; return window;
[05:07:40] <Krinkle> you can't overwrite window
[05:07:43] <tomato> then used like
[05:07:49] <Krinkle> and overwriting the alias to window, doesn't do anything
[05:07:53] <tomato> "omg".foo();
[05:08:25] <Krinkle> x = window; x = "test"; /* is exactly the same as just dong: x = "test";
[05:08:35] <tomato> so why am i seeing it in multiple places on respected CMSs?
[05:08:49] <Krinkle> Well, "respected" doesn't mean anything to me.
[05:08:51] <tomato> that's not what they're doing though
[05:09:03] <Krinkle> If anything, I know that many of the greatest applications may have a great backend, but their front-end is full of crap
[05:09:14] <tomato> they're window.x = test, return window
[05:09:32] <tomato> hmm this one is pretty popular for it's frontend actually
[05:09:37] <Krinkle> just because the creator was a great database and PHP programmer, doesn't mean they don't write stupid javascript :P
[05:10:14] <Krinkle> I've seen a *LOT* of stupid javascript. I know that there is loads of people who don't have the slightest clue how javascrirpt works but just pretend it is a different language and somehow get something working,
[05:10:25] <Krinkle> tomato: do you mind sharing the name of this respected CMS?
[05:10:35] <tomato> http://www.tomatocms.com
[05:10:54] <tomato> they extend the string prototype and use it for theiir core js library
[05:10:55] <Krinkle> You do realize this looks a bit akward, right?
[05:11:05] <tomato> coincidence
[05:11:10] <Krinkle> okay
[05:11:18] <tomato> one of the reasons i;m looking at it closely, lol
[05:11:26] <tomato> ONE OF.. not the only reason ~_~
[05:12:18] <Krinkle> They haven't updated their wiki software is over 3 years. But that aside.
[05:12:21] <Krinkle> downloading now (btw, I've never heard of this CMS)
[05:12:35] <tomato> tomatocms/js/tomato/namespace.js
[05:13:20] <Krinkle> the downloading is taking while..
[05:13:46] <Krinkle> They use jQuery 1.3, the latest is 1.7.2
[05:14:04] <tomato> sure
[05:15:07] <Krinkle> Okay, they copied it from http://blogger.ziesemer.com/2008/05/javascript-namespace-function.html
[05:15:20] <tomato> yep
[05:15:24] <tomato> read that too
[05:15:33] <tomato> but they changed it to prototype the string
[05:15:36] <tomato> fair enough..
[05:15:45] <Krinkle> I fail to see the point of having such a function, looks stupid. If you create an object oriented front-end library, you don't have to do any of this.
[05:15:58] <tomato> both ways return a window back the window and then it has access to namespace.whatever();
[05:16:11] <Krinkle> Again, I suspect it is created by someone who tried to enforce some old habbit of a different programming language.
[05:16:49] <tomato> what's your background and reason for certainty?
[05:19:29] <Krinkle> tomato: Hard to describe my own background. I consider to myself to be an experienced professional front-end web developer. Who knows javascript very well and has contributed to and/or has a profound understanding of some of the bigger javascript libraries.
[05:20:18] <Krinkle> I believe that such a function is not needed if you create sane code.
[05:21:00] <Krinkle> tomato: but all that aside, what's your position in all this? If you use the CMS, why worry about the internals?
[05:21:06] <tomato> but it does effectively extend the window?
[05:21:19] <Krinkle> sure, it'll work.
[05:21:19] <tomato> i'm not using the CMS at all
[05:21:25] <tomato> i'm just studying
[05:21:29] <Krinkle> but there is no point in doing that
[05:21:37] <Krinkle> Don't copy this function or is it in your application.
[05:21:47] <tomato> came accross it and was very curious about the inner workings of window all of a sudden
[05:22:19] <Krinkle> this isn't related to window by the way
[05:22:19] <Krinkle> it could be done to any other object
[05:22:35] <tomato> so why does it work? can't you just function bob(something){window.bob = something} and return nothing
[05:22:39] <Krinkle> all it does is split a string e.g. "foo.bar.baz", split it into an array ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
[05:22:46] <tomato> yes yes i know all that
[05:22:47] <tomato> shessh
[05:22:52] <tomato> but the return window..
[05:22:58] <Krinkle> no
[05:23:13] <Krinkle> then it loops through, and checks if a property by that name exists in the origin object (which could be anything, in this case it uses "window" as origin)
[05:23:29] <tomato> sigh
[05:23:38] <Krinkle> if window.foo exists, it sets origin to window.foo, it it doesn't exist it creates a new object and sets it into origin.foo
[05:23:43] <Krinkle> then it continues and sets origin to origin.foo
[05:23:46] <tomato> that's right
[05:23:52] <Krinkle> and does it same for bar  in origin, etc.
[05:24:02] <Krinkle> until it has done it all and created a nested structure in origin
[05:24:09] <Krinkle> and returns the object of the inner level
[05:24:38] <tomato> it returns the window
[05:24:46] <Krinkle> no
[05:24:46] <tomato> with new properties
[05:24:51] <tomato> o
[05:24:52] <Krinkle> it does not return window
[05:24:52] <tomato> =
[05:24:54] <tomato> window
[05:24:56] <Krinkle> No
[05:24:58] <Krinkle> read further
[05:25:06] <Krinkle> p = o[ns[i]...
[05:25:09] <Krinkle> o = o[ns[i]...
[05:25:26] <Krinkle> namespace("foo.bar") returns bar
[05:25:27] <tomato> yeo
[05:25:33] <tomato> window.foo
[05:25:36] <Krinkle> the object stored in o.foo.bar
[05:26:17] <Krinkle> it does not return window
[05:26:28] <tomato> it returns window.foo.bar
[05:26:28] <Krinkle> nor does it overwrite window
[05:26:42] <Krinkle> it returns bar, which is stored in foo, stored in window
[05:26:59] <Krinkle> objects don't have names in javascript and can be aliased in many places
[05:27:13] <tomato> just bar?
[05:27:27] <Krinkle> foo = {}; foo.bar = foo.quux = hello = {}; hello.test = 1234;
[05:27:33] <Krinkle> then foo.quux.test === 1234
[05:27:36] <tomato> well he's using Foo.Bar from global scope after running this function
[05:27:49] <Krinkle> Yep
[05:28:05] <tomato> and you say he returns just bar?
[05:28:16] <Krinkle> the function returns Bar
[05:28:41] <Krinkle> namespace = "Foo.Bar"; ns = ["Foo", "Bar"];
[05:28:44] <Krinkle> o = window
[05:28:53] <Krinkle> ns[0] === "Foo"
[05:29:04] <tomato> yeh
[05:29:05] <Krinkle> o[ns[0]] = {}
[05:29:19] <Krinkle> that creates window.Foo , aliased locally as o.Foo
[05:29:24] <tomato> o[Foo] = {}
[05:29:35] <Krinkle> and it also re-uses the "o" variable to store Foo
[05:29:39] <tomato> o[Foo][Bar] = {}
[05:29:41] <Krinkle> so now o === window.Foo
[05:29:54] <tomato> return o
[05:29:56] <Krinkle> ns[1] == "Bar"
[05:30:05] <Krinkle> o = o[ns[1]] = {}
[05:30:17] <Krinkle> o === window.Foo.Bar
[05:30:20] <Krinkle> return o
[05:31:29] <Krinkle> tomato: I'm going to stop this now. This method is useless. Don't use it.
[05:31:52] <tomato> window.foo = o.foo... he's returning o, not o.foo
[05:32:33] <Krinkle> Create your application in an object-oriented way. Don't skip levels, that probably means you have a flaw in the design.  Use object literals and extensions instead of stupid code like this
[05:33:40] <tomato> thanks for the tip
[05:33:55] <Krinkle> I downloaded Tomato. I quickly looked through
[05:34:07] <tomato> tomatocms
[05:34:11] <Krinkle> Indeed
[05:34:14] <tomato> i'm tomato.. seperate
[05:34:21] <Krinkle> I think the programmer behind this knows object-oriented programming well. But isn't very well experienced in JavaScript
[05:34:25] <tomato> makes me question your ability with names
[05:34:33] <Krinkle> Almost all calls to namespace() are redundant and can be removed without breaking the application
[05:34:51] <Krinkle> tomato: The folder I got after extracting it was called "tomato"
[05:35:30] <Krinkle> See also #javascript
[05:36:08] <tomato> thnx
[05:54:40] <ayudh> how can i modify some of the buttons in jquery mobile? please help
[05:55:50] <johnline> my mother drove INTO a drive in
[05:56:17] <Onkeltem> Hi all. How to escape html to print its source code on jQuery?
[06:20:36] <Onkeltem> I want to output some text in popup'ed div, which appears similar to how Colobox/Lightbox/Whateverbox images are displayed. Are there any code snippets/plugins for that?
[06:22:19] <Onkeltem> Oh, nevermind, google knows
[06:28:25] <sorenso> @Onkeltem What about this: http://www.queness.com/post/77/simple-jquery-modal-window-tutorial
[06:32:46] <zamba> i'm outputting a set of rows from a database.. and i want to do some inline editing and possibly delete some of these rows directly using jquery/javascript.. what is the suggested way of getting the id of the row into jquery?
[06:33:28] <zamba> i have to output it in the html somehow to make jquery pick it up, but i don't necessary want it visible
[06:33:40] <zamba> everything is in a <li> tag
[06:34:05] <zamba> <li id="560" class="tag">Something</li> ?
[06:34:46] <zamba> where 560 is what i'm looking for.. because i call a delete tag script using ajax
[06:34:51] <zamba> delete_tag?id=560
[06:39:45] <_trev> Set the html attar data-id="some id", then with jquery you can access it via $(element).attr("data-id")
[06:40:06] <_trev> html attr*
[06:43:13] <_cb> I have a series of divs with numbers and a hidden div with an image. When the user hovers over a number the src on the hdden div image is changed, the div moved and then  shown. Everything work but page jitters when the div is shown or hidden. How do I fix?
[06:43:50] <Onkeltem> sorenso: thanks. But I think I'm ok with jQuery UI Dialog widget. The only problem - I can't get it working
[06:44:11] <Onkeltem> I added jQuery ui.dialog libarary, but somehow, jQuery is not extended with .dialog() method
[06:44:14] <Onkeltem> I don't understand why
[06:44:27] <sorenso> Hmm, strange. This should work...
[06:44:38] <thinkerbell> _cb, Maybe encapsulate it inside a div that is same height and width and that stays when you hide and show the inside div
[06:45:47] <_cb> thinkerbell the image is encapsulated inside a div and the div dimensions stays the same. It just moves close to where the mouse pointer is at.
[06:46:25] <_cb> Actually it moves to the left, top coordinates of the number div the user is hovering over.
[06:48:29] <Onkeltem> Does anyone know, is the information here http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ not outdated? I'm loading jquery ui.dialog library, but jQuery still lacking .dialog() method!
[06:48:56] <sorenso> @Onkeltem: Is all included in the correct order so that the UI interface finds jQuery?
[06:58:08] <spanglesontoast> with jquery how would make a seperate instance of an element ?
[06:59:56] <Onkeltem> sorenso: how would I know. I can show the header: http://pastebin.com/JjmBY8Nz
[07:00:34] <Onkeltem> sorenso: looks coorectly for me. First, jquery 1.5.2 is loaded, then ui. And then - my script (jtypo.debug.js).
[07:03:19] <Onkeltem> sorenso: strange, suddenly it stopped claiming there is no method .dialog() and just began to work. Probably, a cache issue
[07:04:02] <sorenso> Onkeltem: Caching has caused a lot of wasted time for me too :)
[07:06:12] <Onkeltem> sorenso: its odd, since I'm in Chrome DevTools, and Disable network cache is set to ON
[07:06:21] <Onkeltem> anyways, thanks )
[07:06:24] <Onkeltem> :-)
[07:06:49] <sorenso> Onkeltem: No problem :)
[07:12:48] <Onkeltem> sorenso: would you jelp me little bit more? :)
[07:13:30] <sorenso> I can try :)
[07:15:24] <Onkeltem> sorenso: my task is pretty simple, I want to output in popup dialog with a paragraph/div escaped content when I click it. The are problems now: 1) when I do $(#a_div).dialog(), it popups but original #a_div content is removed and 2) I don't know how to properly escape html to output its source in the dialog
[07:16:31] <Onkeltem> To solve (1), I need to create a copy of #a_div, I believe, but don't know how to do that :)
[07:17:28] <sorenso> Ok, I see. Give me a minute. I'll try this out.
[07:17:38] <Onkeltem> sorenso: thank you

[07:24:18] <Dolemike> Anyone have experience with Require.js and Knockout that can assist with this?  http://jsfiddle.net/dolemike/eSV3a/

[07:30:21] <sorenso> OnkelTem: Reload the page. I've added some comments :)
[07:30:23] <zamba> i have an anchor tag: <a href="#" id="deleteTag">X</a> .. in my javascript i have the following code: $('#deleteTag').click(function() { deleteTag($(this).parent().attr("data-id")); });
[07:30:57] <zamba> all the anchor tags are in <li> objects, where the id i'm looking for is in <li data-id="idnumber" class="tag"><a href="#" ... > and so on
[07:31:07] <zamba> but it's only launched on the first <li>
[07:32:21] <sorenso> zamba: id attribute has to be  unique.
[07:32:41] <zamba> sorenso: ah, of course
[07:32:57] <zamba> *facepalm*
[07:33:04] <sorenso> Use class instead :)
[07:33:25] <zamba> yup :)
[07:33:30] <sorenso> Great :)
[07:35:00] <Onkeltem> sorenso: thanks, I got the idea.
[07:35:23] <sorenso> Great :)

[08:12:15] <tmchaves> Hello, is there a way to select elements from a page whose id end with _exc or _inc ??
[08:12:43] <bobbytek2> [id=*
[08:12:46] <bobbytek2> or something like that
[08:13:03] <tmchaves> like $("body [id*=_inc]")

[08:13:12] <bobbytek2> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[08:14:37] <bobbytek2> $("[id$='_inc'] [id$='_exc']")
[08:16:17] <tmchaves> yeah! that's it
[08:16:24] <tmchaves> two matchers instead of trying a complex regex
[08:17:46] <tmchaves> I'm afraid they do not work when combined :/
[08:18:54] <bobbytek2> oops, you need to add a comma
[08:19:16] <bobbytek2> $("[id$='_inc'], [id$='_exc']")
[08:19:44] <tmchaves> ah ok. Thanks a lot

[09:05:46] <savid> In python, I would do it like this:  [n for n in numbers if is_even(n)]
[09:06:46] <amunak> hello, I have an $('input:text') selector and I need to expand it to NOT READONLY inputs. There is the "disabled" pseudo-sellector, but there's nothing for readonly inputs. What can I do?
[09:08:25] <bobbytek2> savid: use $.map
[09:08:36] <bobbytek2> and return null if you don't want an element
[09:08:49] <savid> bobbytek2, ahh, thanks.  It was the returning null part I wasn't sure about.
[09:08:51] <bobbytek2> alternatively, use underscore.js's _.filter
[09:13:01] <vjt> amunak: input:not([readonly])
[09:13:16] <amunak> Oh, nvm. It's on stackoverflow. Just $('input:text:not([readonly="readonly"])')
[09:13:19] <amunak> yeah
[09:13:29] <vjt> :)
[09:13:37] <vjt> amunak: :text:not([readonly]) is enough btw
[09:13:50] <amunak> I see, thanks
[09:20:00] <amunak> for some odd reason I have to escape the square brackets. Otherwise my template engine (PET) doesn't eat it.

[10:20:26] <tapas> hi, this is probably a stupid beginner mistake, but: http://pastesite.com/37157
[10:20:48] <tapas> i would expect the p with id="no_loop" to show one of the two messages
[10:21:36] <nlogax> tapas: change `$("#no_loop").innerHTML = "Your browser supports looping";' to `$("#no_loop").html("Your browser supports looping");'
[10:21:46] <nlogax> jQuery objects have no such property
[10:21:57] <nlogax> Well, they do now!
[10:22:31] <tapas> nlogax: ok, giving it a shot :D
[10:23:12] <tapas> hmm
[10:23:54] <bijanv> for the jQuery UI dialog widget, is it possible to set/override the 'minWidth' parameter using CSS instead of at instantiation?  If so, how?

[10:44:33] <greggies> Asmooh: there are some tutorials online
[10:45:06] <greggies> Asmooh: also the game may not be making full contact and may need to be held down.  Try holding the cartridge down while turning it on
[10:45:53] <greggies> if that works you could look into putting something in there to hold it down for you, like another cartridge, a Huey Lewis 8 track, etc.
[10:46:44] <Asmooh> we tried a few other games
[10:58:36] <nlogax> It is quite common for the connector to fail, you could order a few spare ones, just in case

[11:40:20] <Lyfesaver> malinens, do u not like phpGrid?
[11:49:34] <HarryPitfall> noob question
[11:49:34] <gdoron> Hi
[11:49:46] <gdoron> Is this is the place for pro jQuery questions?
[11:49:53] <shoky> yes
[11:50:00] <HarryPitfall> I made a div with overflow scrollbar, and I dynamic add some "p" tags into it (is a chat)
[11:50:13] <HarryPitfall> how I can add and auto-scroll into it?
[11:50:15] <gdoron> I think the best explanation to my problem is a link
[11:50:23] <shoky> that is usually the case
[11:50:32] <gdoron> http://stackoverflow.com/q/10753306/601179
[11:50:48] <gdoron> The question is Why “$().ready(handler)” is not recommended?
[11:51:26] <gdoron> @shoky, are you speaking with me?
[11:52:04] <shoky> ya
[11:52:39] <gdoron> Thanks... :)
[11:52:50] <gdoron> Well, what do you think about it?
[11:53:12] <gdoron> Is it a documention bug?
[11:53:18] <shoky> seems to me that: 1. $().ready is less readable and less "logical"
[11:53:54] <gdoron> I don't think $(handler) is more readable than $().ready(handler)...
[11:54:27] <gdoron> Don't you think?
[11:55:11] <shoky> donno i have an easier time taking $(handler) as a special case of $()  than  $().ready(handler) as a special case of putting a handler on an empty jq object?
[11:55:19] <shoky> that just makes no sense
[11:55:25] <shoky> $() is empty
[11:55:40] <shoky> why would you put an event handler on an empty collection
[11:56:07] <gdoron> And it's perfectly fine to be empty, the ready function doesn't use the selected elements.
[11:56:18] <Dolemike> Is anyone aware of any sample applications that show structuring large javascript/jQuery applications with an OO pattern?  Preferably without a lot of libraries.
[11:56:19] <shoky> that's an implementation detail, irellevant
[11:56:25] <shoky> irrelevant, eevn
[11:56:26] <shoky> even
[11:57:27] <shoky> i would never choose to use $().ready(handler)  even if the docs didn't say anything negative about it
[11:57:43] <shoky> either the special shortcut $(handler) which is really the shortest..
[11:57:52] <gdoron> I think the ready function should have being a utility function just like $.inArray or $.trim. as it doesn't use the selected DOM elements at all.
[11:57:52] <shoky> or the most verbose one $(document).ready
[11:58:05] <shoky> why have a middle one that makes no sense
[11:58:31] <ajpiano> $().ready(fn) only works cause $() used to be a shortcut to $(document)
[11:58:34] <ajpiano> it's really silly to use it
[11:58:56] <ajpiano> and $().ready(fn) is literally now just patched in core to make it work properly for the legacy case
[11:59:01] <shoky> and now you got an answer from a jquery dev, gdoron ;)
[11:59:01] <ajpiano> no one should be using $().ready(fn)
[11:59:37] * shoky plays with ajpianos hair
[11:59:44] <ajpiano> :D
[12:00:32] <gdoron> And why isn't ready a static function like "inArray" and "trim"?
[12:00:41] <gdoron> ready doesn't use the document at all!
[12:01:10] <ajpiano> gdoron: it's kind of just a really old design decision that is what it is now
[12:01:19] <ajpiano> you can always call $.fn.ready(fn) directly, lol
[12:01:58] <ajpiano> and i think the idea was to emulate something like window.lead which while it doesn't "do" anything with the window
[12:02:00] <shoky> i think he just might ;P
[12:02:03] <ajpiano> it still is an event on the window
[12:02:09] <gdoron> But that option isn't listed in the jQuery docs site... :)
[12:02:51] <ajpiano> cause you shouldn't be using it really
[12:02:53] <gdoron> but not using the given document parameter...
[12:03:17] <gdoron> } else if ( jQuery.isFunction( selector ) ) {     return rootjQuery.ready( selector ); }
[12:03:31] <gdoron> rootjQuery = jQuery(document);
[12:03:44] <ajpiano> why are you overthinking this so much?
[12:04:12] <ajpiano> oh you were just asking philoshophically
[12:04:29] <gdoron> Because I love the library and I looked at the source code, and had a design question...
[12:04:39] <gdoron> philoshophically question per se.
[12:04:50] <ajpiano> gotcha
[12:05:01] <ajpiano> yeah, it's not recommend because it's just an old shortcut that's specialcased
[12:05:13] <ajpiano> gdoron: people used to do things like $().mouseover() and all sorts of other madness
[12:05:22] <ajpiano> and people had to do $([]) to get an emptyy jquery object
[12:05:46] <ajpiano> so in 1.4 changed it so $() gave an empty jquery and we just made $().ready(fn) work so as not to break a lot of code
[12:06:04] <ajpiano> but it still broke for people who did $().click(fn) etc, which was a lot fewer people
[12:06:28] <shoky> that would bind to document?
[12:06:29] <gdoron> But $().ready isn't recommended?
[12:06:41] <ajpiano> absolutely not
[12:07:19] <gdoron> I'm sorry to bother you so much, but I don't see and drawbacks for this use. Or am I missing something here?
[12:08:29] <shoky> if there was a serious drawback it wouldn't just end with  "(this is not recommended)"
[12:08:39] <shoky> they say: All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent
[12:08:47] <ajpiano> there aren't any "serious drawbacks"
[12:08:50] <shoky> so obviously there is no immediate drawback
[12:08:53] <ajpiano> like nothing bad is gonna happent o your app
[12:08:59] <gdoron> The thing is that I don't see **any** drawback at all...
[12:09:02] <ajpiano> it' just a weird unreadable legacy usage that i would tend to avoid
[12:09:58] <gdoron> Do you $(fn) is more readable than $().ready(fn) ?!
[12:10:15] <ajpiano> i always do $(document).ready(fn) in actual apps
[12:10:23] <ajpiano> and then typically there's only one doc ready block in the app
[12:10:29] <ajpiano> so it's not exactly like a maintenance thing
[12:10:36] <ajpiano> i think $(fn) is pretty unreadable too
[12:10:50] <ajpiano> it's just A Thing That You Have To Know Works™
[12:10:52] <ajpiano> :|
[12:11:03] <gdoron> :)
[12:11:35] <ajpiano> the number of overloads on jQuery() is a ... high number
[12:11:42] <ajpiano> fn is probably a superfluous one
[12:11:46] <ajpiano> but we can't get rid of it
[12:12:12] <gdoron> Adding a "ready" util function seems to be the best option.
[12:12:51] <ajpiano> to what end?
[12:13:24] <ajpiano> i can't see how adding yet another doc ready syntax just to ameliorate concern over one super cheap selection
[12:13:34] <ajpiano> would help the situation
[12:14:12] <ajpiano> not to mention that jQuery.ready() is already taken :p
[12:14:13] <gdoron> You're right, I meant if you just now writing the library, this seems to be the best place, isn't it?
[12:14:43] <ajpiano> gdoron: aye
[12:16:17] <Goopyo> Q: I have a  ('.class_name').click() function that sets $this.attr('class', 'anoterh_class_name')  in hopes that it would not longer be detected by the click() function, although the class is changed, its still being detected by the click fuction
[12:16:22] <gdoron> I rest my case :)
[12:16:58] <shoky> gdoron: ya nudnik :)
[12:17:13] <gdoron> What did you mean by "jQuery.ready() is already taken", I couldn't see this function anywhere
[12:17:30] <ajpiano> gdoron: it's not a public api
[12:17:36] <ajpiano> console.log( jQuery.ready )
[12:17:39] <sacho> yes it is
[12:18:08] <gdoron> Ohh, right, it's the function why the delay, right?
[12:18:16] <sacho> Goopyo, that's not how event listeners work
[12:18:24] <sacho> Goopyo, they are bound to the dom element, not the selector
[12:18:27] <sacho> or well, your case is
[12:18:45] <sacho> there are several ways to solve your problem but it depends what you're trying to achieve
[12:18:52] <gdoron> shoky, how do you know hebrew?
[12:18:55] <sacho> and your jquery version
[12:19:18] <Goopyo> well I am taking a div and moving it to another div using prependTo I want to change what clickin on the div does after it is moved
[12:19:21] <shoky> gdoron: isn't nudnik yiddish? :)
[12:19:42] <shoky> gdoron: i'm israeli
[12:19:48] <sacho> Goopyo, you could simply remove the event listeners as one solution
[12:20:03] <sacho> Goopyo, if you don't want to remove all event listeners, you could use namespaces to remove just the ones you want
[12:20:13] <gdoron> אההה, אז אתה רואה את זה?
[12:20:23] <shoky> ew, yes i see that, plz no more :)
[12:20:32] <Goopyo> can you tell me how I'd do either one?
[12:20:42] <gdoron> :)
[12:21:50] <gdoron> Shoky, do you have an account in Stack overflow?
[12:22:08] <shoky> i do
[12:22:23] <sacho> Goopyo, what version of jquery are you using?
[12:22:49] <Goopyo> 1.72.2
[12:22:51] <shoky> (im antishok there..)
[12:22:53] <Goopyo> 1.7.2*
[12:22:57] <gdoron> Do you want to sum this discussion as an answer in SO?
[12:23:02] <shesek> מה, אני לא הישראלי היחיד פה? :P
[12:23:07] <sacho> Goopyo, http://api.jquery.com/off/
[12:23:15] <gdoron> כנראה שלא
[12:23:16] <gdoron> :)
[12:23:25] <shoky> oh noes
[12:24:17] <sacho> Goopyo, you should also consider using on() for your event listeners
[12:24:22] <izual> Hi, I want to overwrite the onclick functions of some links, how is this possible?
[12:24:29] <shoky> gdoron: we dont really have anything to add to the answers you already got there, no?
[12:24:43] <shoky> SO will be fine.
[12:24:47] <sacho> izual, delete them and replace them with the new ones
[12:24:53] <shoky> if you care about SO reputation, go for it :)
[12:25:08] <izual> sacho, I was hoping for something more elegant
[12:25:25] <gdoron> Rep is always nice :}
[12:25:33] <shesek> izual, are you actually using `onclick` in your HTML?
[12:25:41] <shesek> that's so 2004ish
[12:25:51] <shoky> if you lack self esteem, SO rep is nice, i suppose :)
[12:25:54] <izual> shesek, I am assigning it with jquery from the beggining
[12:26:00] <Goopyo> thanks sacho
[12:26:24] <gdoron> But the thing is that I still don't get why $(fn) is better than the not recomended $().ready(fn) option.
[12:26:31] <sacho> izual, you can't really mutate functions
[12:26:37] <shoky> gdoron: it's shorter
[12:26:51] <gdoron> :)
[12:26:57] <sacho>  so remove/add is the most concise solution
[12:27:00] <shesek> izual, you could remove all the click handlers using off('click'
[12:27:06] <shesek> izual, you could remove all the click handlers using off('click'), than add whatever you want
[12:27:24] <izual> I will try this
[12:27:29] <shesek> ... but it will remove EVERYTHING, so it might remove stuff it shouldn't
[12:27:54] <sacho> izual, http://api.jquery.com/off/
[12:28:03] <sacho> for more options in the way to remove them
[12:28:06] <shesek> think about the poor developer who's gonna work with your code, add his own click handler earlier than when you're removing all of them, and not understand why it doesn't work
[12:28:20] <asher^> hi guys, im using a jqueryui dialog that is opened by a button press. I am trying to .hide() one of the divs in the dialog when the button is pressed, but for some reason it isnt working. does the dialog override this somehow?
[12:28:36] <shesek> izual, you really should just remove the specific function you want to remove if possible... or just not add it to begin with, which seems to make more sense
[12:28:59] <shesek> asher^, it shouldn't. can you show an example on jsfiddle?
[12:29:11] <asher^> 1 sec
[12:31:09] <asher^> interestingly, when i isolate the code on jsfiddle it hides the div sucessfully
[12:31:11] <asher^> :-/
[12:32:05] <shoky> gdoron/shesek: happy WEEKS
[12:32:09] <asher^> i wonder if its possible that the validator plugin is causing problems
[12:32:11] <shesek> asher^, yeah, in many cases the process of isolating the problematic part solves the problem.... now try to understand why :-)
[12:32:40] <shesek> shoky, weeks is kinda over already... but happy weeks to you too
[12:32:56] <asher^> any tips on how i go about that? the fiddle with the isolated code is here http://jsfiddle.net/hPGGN/ (sorry for no css)
[12:33:11] <shoky> weakz
[12:33:34] <gdoron> מוצאי חג טוב :)
[12:35:02] <asher^> ohh, looks like it might be the validator
[12:35:14] <asher^> i have a feeling this problem will be non-trivial to solce (at 3:35am)
[12:35:59] <raj> whatup
[12:36:13] <shoky> sup rajy
[12:36:24] <raj> family guy reruns
[12:36:26] <shesek> asher^, css isn't really relevant
[12:36:37] <shoky> got css now: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hPGGN/1/
[12:36:41] <raj> procastinating a shower to go eat hamburgers and hotdogs
[12:36:53] <shoky> hamburgers AND hotdogs?
[12:36:57] <gdoron> ha?
[12:37:00] <raj> memorial day bbq
[12:37:02] <shoky> in a sandwich?!??
[12:37:07] <shoky> ohh sweet
[12:38:24] <shoky> asher^: it seems to be working fine...
[12:38:45] <shoky> it IS working fine.
[12:38:49] <shoky> the div is hidden
[12:38:50] <shesek> asher^, add an break point before the dialog('open'), see what the `relationshipdiv` selector finds, check with the elements inspector if the CSS is changed
[12:39:02] <asher^> shoky yeah it does on jsfiddle. in my code it doesnt, i worked out its the jquery validator plugin
[12:39:06] <asher^> as soon as i disable that it works
[12:39:07] <shesek> I mean, the relationshipdiv inline style
[12:39:07] <shoky> oh
[12:39:39] <shoky> then the fiddle isn't of much help ;p
[12:39:52] <asher^> yeah, it did make me realise its not that code itself though
[12:40:03] <shoky> aye
[12:42:46] <asher^> hmm, does jqueryui have nice looking dropdown menus?
[12:42:57] <shoky> it should, in 1.9 :S
[12:43:21] <asher^> so thats a no then :p
[12:43:47] <FJ1> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/menu.html
[12:44:11] <shoky> yah i was just digging that up too ;P
[12:44:29] <asher^> im after just a regular dropdown, only one line displayed when closed
[12:45:25] <ryanaz> Is there a way to have a <div> load an external stylesheet not referenced in the <head> ?
[12:46:10] <ryanaz> something like:   <div id=test style=test.css> ... </div>
[12:46:36] <ryanaz> hey systemfault
[12:46:39] <ryanaz> Is there a way to have a <div> load an external stylesheet not referenced in the <head> ?
[12:47:51] <systemfault> Just create a <link> element with javascript and append it to the head?
[12:49:03] <Haprog> I think you could also use a <script> @import
[12:49:11] <Haprog> *<style> @import
[12:49:18] <ryanaz> systemfault:  Well, the idea is I'm doing a dynamic .load to bring in additional <div> elements, which may or may not have already been defined in the <head> style...  so my idea is to have a separate css file for those <div> elements so I dont need to specify those styles in the <head> if they're not going to be used...
[12:49:57] <ryanaz> Haprog: can you do that within the div or body of the div somewhere?
[12:50:09] <Haprog> why not
[12:50:15] <Haprog> <style> doesn't have to be in the <head>
[12:50:24] <Haprog> works in the <body> also
[12:50:44] <ryanaz> cool, i didn't know that.
[12:50:45] <Dr-Bombay> <style> shouldn't be anywhere, the w3 hates it and could deprecate it
[12:50:57] <ryanaz> so I could actually define the <style> for a particular <div> inside the <div?
[12:51:13] <Haprog> ryanaz: I think so, just try it out
[12:51:25] <Haprog> it the styles will affect the whole DOM though
[12:51:31] <ryanaz> Dr-Bombay: What should be used instead of <style> ?
[12:51:31] <Haprog> so use proper selectors
[12:51:42] <Dr-Bombay> ryanaz: link
[12:52:19] <Haprog> Dr-Bombay: I don't agree. it will always be slower to use a link because it adds another HTTP request.
[12:52:23] <FJ1> $("head").append($("<link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' type='text/css' media='screen' />"));
[12:53:12] <ryanaz> FJ1: That's a good idea...
[12:53:12] <Haprog> sometimes I use a templating system to append external css files straight into <style> elements.
[12:53:50] <Dr-Bombay> I didn't say link would be faster
[12:54:11] <FJ1> or $('head').append( $('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />').attr('href', 'style.css') );
[12:54:14] <ryanaz> Dr-Bombay: What's the difference between an external link and defining it right in the <style> ?
[12:54:20] <Haprog> I've never head the w3 somehow hates <style>. Got any link on that?
[12:54:43] <Dr-Bombay> ryanaz: I already explained the difference. the w3c hates the style element and anything else that mixes other languages into HTML text
[12:54:54] <Haprog> and ofcourse they "could" deprecate anything in the future in the standards they define.
[12:54:56] <Dr-Bombay> it's a historical mistake
[12:55:03] <FJ1> @dr-bombay agree
[12:55:34] <ryanaz> Dr-Bombay: That makes sense, but they do it with <script>  as well
[12:56:01] <Dr-Bombay> ryanaz: they're not thrilled about inline scripts either
[12:56:06] <ryanaz> heh nice..
[12:56:15] <Haprog> weird. how about XHTML as it's XML and can contain even more different languages?
[12:56:33] <Haprog> like MathML, svg and whatnot
[12:56:46] <Dr-Bombay> haprog: you answered your own question: it's XML, not arbitrary languages
[12:57:23] <Haprog> hmm true
[12:58:13] <ryanaz> Has anyone created a dynamic css before?
[12:58:16] <Dr-Bombay> ryanaz: have you seen what the w3c had to do in HTML5 to standardize parsing of documents with inline scripts?
[12:58:23] <Dr-Bombay> it's fugly
[13:00:47] <ryanaz> I created a system to make dynamic websites easier to be created, but I'm wondering if I need to scrap the whole concept..  it's served it's purpose to create css based sites, but now I want to convert everything leveraging more ajax/jquery/javascript and it's looking like I need a new hammer.
[13:00:49] <systemfault> ryanaz: Usually, for something that dynamic.. you write a javascript widget system..
[13:01:08] <systemfault> ryanaz: The widget would load the stylesheet on initialization.
[13:01:14] <ryanaz> systemfault:  got an example?
[13:02:13] <systemfault> I don't know of any with jQuery.. But I saw a few in the past when I was using YUI3… hmm
[13:04:30] <ryanaz> http://alexmarandon.com/articles/web_widget_jquery/
[13:04:33] <ryanaz> reading this
[13:07:09] <systemfault> ryanaz: His code is ugly but you get the idea..
[13:08:33] <systemfault> Every widget should be a plugin and optimally loads its information from already existing markup (So you don't kill your SEO)
[13:09:09] <ryanaz> it looks like he's appending the css into the head like FJ1 was saying to do
[13:09:20] <systemfault> That's definitely the way to go
[13:09:47] <systemfault> Each widget could have its own stylesheet
[13:10:32] <Goopyo> any where I can find a script to live show/hide divs based on a input field?
[13:12:27] <systemfault> ryanaz: You could even use an async script loader like require.js
[13:22:48] <SmartTowel> can i use the accordion effect with jquery's datepicker? i want to have the calendar display events and when i click on a date, i want that week to slide down revealing the event's description.
[13:58:22] <raj> is it safe to put a user's username in the request.cookie (shared from server with $.cookie) ?
[13:58:37] <Angelos_> hi guys
[13:59:07] <Angelos_> :) I wanted to know how you would dynamically change the value property on a html button in jquery
[13:59:17] <raj> as well as that user's permissions
[13:59:24] <Woet> raj: of course not
[13:59:29] <raj> why not?
[13:59:36] <Woet> raj: because cookies can be changed by the client.
[13:59:57] <raj> yes, but I recheck permission serverside if they try submitting something
[13:59:59] <Haprog> depends on what you use it for, but never trust cookies.
[13:59:59] <raj> or changing whatever
[14:00:05] <Woet> raj: then there is no need to store them in a cookie.
[14:00:20] <raj> i need to know whether to display certain elements, based on the user's permissions
[14:00:35] <Woet> raj: then you check that server side and not using a cookie
[14:02:06] <raj> Woet, so you're saying do an extra post just to check that?
[14:02:20] <Woet> raj: unless what you want to display is fine for other people to see, yes.
[14:02:21] <raj> like, for each function
[14:02:28] <raj> yes, it's fine that they see it
[14:02:43] <raj> they can't actually do anything special
[14:02:46] <Goopyo> Question I posted on SO if any of you have a good solution for: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10777264/searching-many-divs-attributes-in-jquery
[14:02:48] <Woet> then sure, display it using javascript
[14:02:51] <raj> but only admins are supposed ot see some stuff
[14:02:56] <Woet> but _only_ if its information everybody can see
[14:03:44] <Haprog> raj: ofcourse you don't need an extra post. just check the user on serverside when the page first loads.
[14:04:08] <Haprog> raj: if you need the info on JS just set it as a JS variable from PHP or whatever serverside language you're using
[14:04:16] <raj> right, but then I add elements dynamically
[14:04:26] <raj> what's a JS variable?
[14:04:37] <Haprog> you mean you don't know what a variable is?...
[14:04:46] <raj> how can I set a JS variable serverside
[14:04:52] <Onkeltem> I want to hover over a page, and react when mouse hovers specific elements. How to do this?
[14:04:55] <Haprog> eh. how do you output anything?
[14:04:57] <Haprog> echo
[14:04:59] <Haprog> or print
[14:05:01] <Haprog> or whatever
[14:05:07] <Haprog> just like you output html you output js
[14:05:19] <Haprog> between <script></script> for example
[14:05:28] <Tehbeard> How would I change the size of the buttons for jquery UI? They seem to be pretty big with default css.
[14:05:37] <raj> ?on @ Onkeltem
[14:05:37] <caniuse> Onkeltem: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:05:59] <raj> Haprog, but that's only possible at page load
[14:06:07] <raj> so then store the variable as a global?
[14:06:11] <Haprog> in PHP you could just do <script> var userdata = "<?php json_encode(...whatever...); ?>";</script>
[14:06:37] <Haprog> a global variable is probably the easiest. doesn't have to be though
[14:06:49] <Haprog> you just need to pass around the info whereever you need it
[14:06:51] <raj> ya, i was gonna use a cookie
[14:07:26] <FJ1> if he don't know javascript variables, why should he know json?
[14:08:01] <Haprog> actually you need an echo there in my example
[14:08:54] <Onkeltem> raj: would you be a little bit more specific? I have attached hover event handler to HTMLDocument, and was expecting to be called when the mouse moves from one element to another, having its recorded in e.target. But this doesn't work
[14:09:00] <Haprog> echo json_encode(); or you don't even need json_encode if it's a simple string or integer you need. json_encode is just easier if you need anything else like nested arrays converted to JS syntax.
[14:09:13] <raj> Onkeltem, can you show some code?
[14:09:23] <raj> or use www.jsfiddle.net to make a demo
[14:09:29] <raj> cuz i'm not sure what you mean exactly
[14:12:03] <xsamurai> using jquery autocomplete with a remote source, is there an event triggered if the data returned is 0
[14:21:10] <Onkeltem> raj: while I was preparing example code for you, I think I found the problem. http://jsfiddle.net/nGfrB/
[14:21:48] <Onkeltem> raj: since I declared the event handler for the body, hover doesn't occure when I move through inside elements
[14:22:22] <Tehbeard> Is there a way to globally set the font size for UI elements? default setting seems to be large font mode
[14:22:44] <Onkeltem> raj: what do I want, is to hover over page and hightlihght any element under mouse cursor
[14:24:29] <Onkeltem> raj: so I need somehow to bind hover handler for every element
[14:31:25] <Storm3y> I have multiple divs on a page, I'm wondering if its possible to sort those using JQuery. http://pastebin.com/zm4yyV9v
[14:31:43] <Storm3y> This is the layout of the Divs, I'd like a button to sort by name, genre alphabeticaly.
[14:40:47] <White> hi all
[14:41:34] <White> $(document).ready(function(){     $('#menu ul li').hover(function(){$(this).children("img").effect("scale",{percent:125, from:{height:40, width:40} },500)}, function(){$(this).children("img").effect("scale",{percent:80, from:{height:50, width:50} },500)});     });
[14:42:29] <White> i get infinite scaling on mouseover of the image with that code, how do I get it to always start from  40px
[14:42:49] <White> *the original image size 40 px  x 40 px
[14:44:52] <WhiteWizzard> hello?
[14:46:35] <Doxin> somehow the .empy function doesn;t seem to be working. $("#"+id).empty(); $("#"+id).html(ndat); only adds to the html. it doesn't empty it
[14:46:43] <Doxin> oh crap
[14:46:45] <Doxin> nvm
[14:46:49] <WhiteWizzard> ?
[14:48:12] <Doxin> WhiteWizzard: my source didn't look like I thought it looked :P
[14:48:42] <Doxin> WhiteWizzard: I keep getting tripped up by the browser rearanging code which has block elements in p elements
[15:29:04] <bitbonsai> hey folks.. I was thinking about $.extend...
[15:29:18] <bitbonsai> if you do a deep copy, you'll overwrite existing methods
[15:29:37] <bitbonsai> so suppose I'd like to extend but preserve existing methods, like init(), for instance
[15:29:57] <bitbonsai> what do you think about copying the init to init_SOMERANDOMNUMBER_ for instance
[15:30:29] <snover> wat
[15:30:44] <bitbonsai> so if you have var a = {one: 1, init: function(){ alert(one) }}
[15:31:19] <bitbonsai> b = {two: 2, init: function(){ alert(two) }}
[15:31:19] <dabear> you wanna merge objects without overwriting
[15:31:27] <dabear> what's the use case?
[15:31:32] <bitbonsai> exactly
[15:31:43] <bitbonsai> preserve both init()
[15:31:48] <dabear> e.g. why the heck do you need to do this, ever?
[15:32:12] <snover> bitbonsai: sounds like you’ve outgrown jquery and need something more like http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojo/declare.html
[15:32:13] <bitbonsai> just thinking...
[15:33:04] <dabear> bitbonsai: http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
[15:33:11] <dabear> something like that?
[15:33:15] <bitbonsai> snover: thanks for the tip, I'll take a look... trying to avoid conflicts with modules
[15:33:21] <bitbonsai> dabear: opening
[15:36:18] <ryanaz> to mimic a form's onChange=\"this.form.submit()\" would you use jquery's .change?  http://api.jquery.com/change/  to detect a change on the form?
[15:36:23] <ryanaz> or would you use someting else?
[15:36:25] <snover> dabear: been there, done that, too simple
[15:36:53] <dabear> i'd just use jquery ui widgets
[15:36:55] <snover> when you start needing inheritance you usually need more application structure too
[15:37:01] <snover> been there, done that, horrible api
[15:37:57] <dabear> ok, your opinion. I like it :/
[15:39:10] <bitbonsai> snover: you're talking about .change?
[15:39:18] <snover> bitbonsai: what?
[15:39:39] <bitbonsai> snover: "when you start needing inheritance you usually need more application structure too"
[15:40:19] <dabear> bitbonsai: whaat
[15:40:59] <bitbonsai> dabear: quote snover: "when you start needing inheritance you usually need more application structure too"
[15:41:11] <ryanaz> how do I detect when someone is changing a select in a form?
[15:41:11] <bitbonsai> is this about $.change or applcation extension?
[15:41:17] <dabear> bitbonsai: how do you relate that to .change?
[15:41:26] <snover> yeah, that means like…a module system, components that are designed to work together
[15:41:27] <snover> etc
[15:42:00] <bitbonsai> dabear: ryanaz' question
[15:42:41] <ryanaz> bitbonsai:  Do you know the answer? : )
[15:44:24] <bitbonsai> ryanaz: from the top of my head? if the form only have one element, like a search form, would do $('#el').change(function(){ $('#form').submit() })
[15:46:09] <dabear> did you guts know that form elements have a property called "form" that refers to its parent form?
[15:46:15] <ryanaz> ok, but let's say when they select something I basically want to do a .load instead of submit
[15:46:22] <dabear> you can do this.form.submit() instead..
[15:57:07] <RaijiN_> Hello everyone :)
[15:57:53] <RaijiN_> How come no one is talking xD ?
[15:57:58] <RaijiN_> Anyone Alive xD ?
[15:58:33] <ryanaz> dabear or bitbonsai: can either of you tell me why this function isn't being called when I change the select option?  https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[15:59:31] <ryanaz> it's the call is working on the first load, but not when you select.
[16:00:02] <RaijiN_> I need some help on the jQuery.on() function
[16:00:12] <RaijiN_> It isnt working as expected.
[16:00:14] <ryanaz> RaijiN_ : I'm new here
[16:00:24] <ryanaz> lookng for help myself
[16:00:31] <RaijiN_> M new here too.
[16:00:34] <RaijiN_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10776995/how-to-attach-an-event-handler-for-dynamically-generated-child-divs
[16:00:50] <RaijiN_> Thats my Query. I hope someone can help me T.T
[16:01:45] <RaijiN_> Is there some rules on chatting in here :O ?
[16:01:48] <WhiteWizzard> hi all, I am having a problem with mouseenter and mouseleave events
[16:02:02] <WhiteWizzard> The images keep being resized
[16:02:03] <WhiteWizzard> http://jsfiddle.net/2h4LL/1/
[16:02:07] <ryanaz> RaijiN_ : It would appear you and I are trying to do something very similar
[16:02:20] <RaijiN_> Really :O ?
[16:03:25] <ryanaz> ya.. i'm fairly new to javascript / jquery stuff... but been doing html/css/dynamic websites for a while now..
[16:04:03] <ryanaz> i have the dynamic part loading..
[16:04:05] <ryanaz> https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[16:04:37] <ryanaz> but i can't seem to get it to run the function again after it selects.
[16:05:53] <RaijiN_> Same here.
[16:06:40] <ryanaz> any thoughts people?
[16:06:44] <systemfault> ryanaz: What's up?
[16:06:54] <ryanaz> i can't seem to get this to work.. https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[16:07:12] <ryanaz> it loads the first dynamic part first.. but when I do the select it doesn't call the function and re-load
[16:07:15] <systemfault> What is it supposed to do?
[16:07:18] <RaijiN_> systemfault. Care to help me out as well please.
[16:07:52] <ryanaz> well, if you look at the load function it runs:  https://beta.stratfuel.com/api/fbo_fuel_update_head.cgi?id_community=&id_location=undefined
[16:08:16] <ryanaz> and puts that data into the fbo_fuel_update_head div ..
[16:08:33] <ryanaz> but when I change a select, it doesn't run the load function again with the updated select.
[16:08:38] <ryanaz> seems like this would be very basic
[16:08:46] <systemfault> RaijiN_: You got an answer on SO
[16:09:07] <RaijiN_> I tried that solution but it didnt work.
[16:09:34] <RaijiN_> For some reason the #layout call is executed first and the the other pages are loaded in.
[16:09:44] <ryanaz> systemfault:  Any ideas?
[16:10:15] <systemfault> ryanaz: I don't see any code.. the page doesn't do anything at all.
[16:10:24] <systemfault> $('#fbo_head').change(function() {
[16:10:25] <systemfault>   update_fbo_head();
[16:10:26] <systemfault> });
[16:10:31] <systemfault> That's your whole code on the page..
[16:10:43] <ryanaz> i stripped it down to the basics...
[16:10:52] <RaijiN_> Can you please check my code please :)
[16:11:11] <RaijiN_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10776995/how-to-attach-an-event-handler-for-dynamically-generated-child-divs
[16:11:14] <ryanaz> systemfault:  you gotta look at the first link  https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[16:11:56] <systemfault> ryanaz: Your update_fbo_head is in the closure… so it doesn't exists out of it
[16:12:18] <ryanaz> ah, so what's the proper syntax for that?
[16:12:20] <ryanaz> pull it out of there?
[16:12:39] <WhiteWizzard> i figured my problem out
[16:12:40] <systemfault> ryanaz: Pull the function definition out of the $(function() {})
[16:12:48] <ryanaz> ok
[16:12:50] <systemfault> ryanaz: Leave the call inside though
[16:13:15] <RaijiN_> My Turn please :)
[16:13:42] <systemfault> RaijiN_: Where is layout? in the right column?
[16:13:49] <ryanaz> systemfault:  still broke...
[16:13:52] <ryanaz> https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[16:13:55] <RaijiN_> Its on the Custom Page.
[16:14:37] <RaijiN_> Custom page line 2
[16:15:17] <systemfault> RaijiN_: $(document.body).on('click', '#layout > *', function() { handle here }); ?Tried that?
[16:15:34] <systemfault> ryanaz: I'm looking
[16:16:28] <RaijiN_> systemfault_: Yes. I tried it as , $(document).on('click', '#layout > div', function() {});
[16:16:51] <RaijiN_> It didnt work.
[16:16:55] <ryanaz> systemfault;   I can see in the web logs that it doesn't call the update_fbo_head() when you change the select.
[16:17:12] <systemfault> ryanaz: I can't change the select because it's always empty..
[16:17:52] <ryanaz> ah... hang on .
[16:18:58] <RaijiN_> I tried what you just wrote. It doesnt work T.T
[16:19:20] <ryanaz> systemfault:  try now https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[16:19:30] <systemfault> RaijiN_: Perhaps that kind of selector doesn't work with event delegation...
[16:19:41] <RaijiN_> D:
[16:21:41] <RaijiN_> OMg i got an answer on SO
[16:21:49] <RaijiN_> I ma try it out and see if it works :)
[16:21:58] <RaijiN_> I ll let you know once i figure it out xD
[16:22:23] <systemfault> ryanaz: Has the form element have change event?
[16:22:29] <systemfault> *Does
[16:23:19] <ryanaz> systemfault:  if you look at the html code from the test.html I added a <script> </script> section that created it, but when I inspect it in safari it doesn't show up anywhere
[16:23:38] <ryanaz>   <script>
[16:23:38] <ryanaz>   $('#fbo_head').change(function() {
[16:23:39] <ryanaz>     update_fbo_head();
[16:23:39] <ryanaz>   });
[16:23:39] <ryanaz>   </script>
[16:24:00] <ryanaz> is it not showing up because it's in the form section?
[16:24:14] <systemfault> It should not mind
[16:25:08] <ryanaz> yah, i moved it, doesn't matter
[16:25:10] <ryanaz> do you see it htere?
[16:25:44] <RaijiN_> Its not working D:
[16:25:52] <RaijiN_> God. What am i doing wrong in this Z
[16:26:19] <systemfault> RaijiN_: Targeting an element by its tag name.
[16:26:54] <RaijiN_> It works if i place the scripts on individual pages.
[16:27:12] <RaijiN_> I mean if i place the respective scripts in each page.
[16:27:17] <systemfault> RaijiN_: I hope your script are not loaded with .load
[16:27:43] <ryanaz> what's wrong with load ?
[16:27:53] <systemfault> ryanaz: .load strips all scripts.
[16:27:57] <RaijiN_> Nope they arent.
[16:29:21] <ryanaz> systemfault:  Hm, this is strange.. can't figure it out...
[16:30:39] <ryanaz> systemfault:  maybe I'm approaching this all wrong.  What's the right way to do forms with ajax to where pull down fields create new pull down fields with a database backend?
[16:30:43] <systemfault> ryanaz: I don't think it's that.. but fix it anyway.. the attribute id of fbo_head isn't wrapped in double quotes
[16:31:08] <systemfault> ryanaz: You would target the change event of the select element?
[16:31:33] <RaijiN_> I re-wrote the whole code. But still the same result.
[16:32:05] <ryanaz> systemfault:  right now I'm targeting any change in the form...  and submitting both selected element to the backend
[16:32:23] <ryanaz> systemfault: updated attribute id
[16:36:26] <systemfault> ryanaz: I don't even know if the change event bubbles
[16:36:53] <systemfault> ryanaz: You're doing something I never did… ever.
[16:37:08] <systemfault> Targeting a form for a change event
[16:37:17] <systemfault> Just target the select instead :/
[16:37:24] <ryanaz> systemfault: trying that now ..
[16:37:38] <systemfault> I would put my hand in a fire that it works.
[16:37:43] <zamba> my chrome inspection gives me a lot of these: "event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future."
[16:37:58] <systemfault> zamba: Then update to a recent version of jQuery
[16:38:04] <zamba> systemfault: ah, ok
[16:38:07] <ryanaz> same result.
[16:38:08] <zamba> systemfault: so that's the problem here?
[16:38:17] <systemfault> zamba: Yeah
[16:38:33] <systemfault> zamba: layerX and layerY are prehistoric :(
[16:38:44] <ryanaz> systemfault:  updated - - same result https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[16:39:19] <zamba> i'm running jquery 1.4.4, yeah :)
[16:39:31] <zamba> what's the preferred way of including jquery?
[16:39:36] <zamba> directly off google?
[16:39:44] <zamba> can i use a link that means i'll stay current?
[16:39:54] <systemfault> zamba: You don't want that.
[16:40:03] <systemfault> zamba: Because sometimes there's breaking changes.
[16:40:16] <ryanaz> zamba: if they depreciate your functionality you're using you're hosed
[16:40:17] <systemfault> But yeah.. directly from google is the way to go
[16:40:46] <ryanaz> zamba: point to the version of jquery you're built around and tested around
[16:41:26] <ryanaz> systemfault:  any ideas?  pointing to the select now
[16:42:48] <systemfault> Ahhh…. lol
[16:43:01] <systemfault> ryanaz: You're killing your handlers with .load
[16:43:12] <systemfault> That's your problem.
[16:43:12] <ryanaz> oh crap, .load breaks that?
[16:43:21] <ryanaz> what am I supposed to do then?
[16:43:40] <systemfault> ryanaz: Nah, you attach events to the selects… then 1 second later, you're replacing the html...
[16:43:55] <systemfault> Try using event delegation.
[16:44:30] <ryanaz> systemfault:  right...  my thought was to have a majority of my intense <div> generated by scripts using .load
[16:44:33] <ryanaz> systemfault:  is that insane?
[16:44:52] <systemfault> ryanaz: It won't scale...
[16:45:17] <da-beginner> good morning.. is there a native jquery function like 'toProperCase( )'?
[16:45:38] <systemfault> ryanaz: You would need to use either event delegation on reattach the handlers at then end of every .load
[16:45:50] <Bankzilla> da-beginner: what are you trying to achieve?
[16:46:05] <ryanaz> systemfault:  why is it any more difficult to feed <div> to a client then some other data format?
[16:46:29] <systemfault> ryanaz: No problem with the divs, the problem are the scripts
[16:46:46] <systemfault> ryanaz: If you only want to load markup, .load is just perfect.
[16:47:07] <da-beginner> Bankzilla: i want to make a string into proper case, eg: "hello there" to "Hello There"
[16:47:17] <Bankzilla> you mean upper case?
[16:47:54] <systemfault> ryanaz: Try to attach a change event on the parent of the form like that: $('#fbo_fuel').on('change', 'select', function() {update_whatever(); });
[16:48:42] <da-beginner> Bankzilla: not uppercase, propercase. When you do uppercase, it will be "HELLO THERE", right?
[16:49:04] <Psylene> wtf is proper case lol
[16:49:39] <da-beginner> or title case
[16:49:44] <da-beginner> you know what i mean :)
[16:49:52] <systemfault> Capitalize
[16:49:55] <da-beginner> yes
[16:50:08] <Psylene> the first letter of each word?
[16:50:48] <Bankzilla> da-beginner: theres no function that I know of, but you can find your answer here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/196972/convert-string-to-proper-case-with-javascript/196991#196991
[16:50:55] <ryanaz> systemfault:  This is working!  https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[16:51:53] <systemfault> ryanaz: Winz
[16:52:09] <systemfault> ryanaz: The whole time… I wasn't looking at what the update function did..
[16:52:29] <systemfault> (I can be an idiot sometimes)
[16:52:58] <da-beginner> thanks... one more question: how do i select DIVs with id = "FeedbackYesButton" and "FeedbackNoButton" but not "FeedbackSubmitButton"?
[16:53:16] <da-beginner> so far i have i have this selector $('*[id^=Feedback][id$=Button]')
[16:53:40] <da-beginner> thinking of adding another selector like [id*=(yes|no)] but this is regex so it wont work
[16:53:44] <systemfault> da-beginner: $('#FeedbackYesButton, #FeedbackNoButton')
[16:54:52] <da-beginner> systemfault: i cant do this because the feedback button actually has some more dynamic values, eg: Feedback_1_YesButton, Feedback_2_NoButton
[16:55:04] <systemfault> wtf… :(
[16:55:18] <da-beginner> thus have $('*[id^=Feedback][id$=Button]')
[16:55:31] <ryanaz> systemfault:  check it out :  https://beta.stratfuel.com/test.html
[16:55:33] <da-beginner> the divs were created by a script
[16:55:42] <systemfault> da-beginner: Use :not() I guess..
[16:55:53] <systemfault> da-beginner: Looks like a design problem to me though..
[16:55:58] <ryanaz> systemfault:  select "Ryan Strat" and then the location populates correctly
[16:56:00] <Dr-Bombay> da-beginner: describing your problem accurately is important to getting an accurate answer
[16:56:22] <systemfault> ryanaz: Good :)
[16:56:30] <ryanaz> systemfault: so why the h*** does that work ?
[16:56:31] <ryanaz> :)
[16:56:43] <freeed> Hey all.. is a shortcut to use $(this) within .html()? Something like   $(ele).html('foo' + $(this) + 'bar')
[16:57:22] <systemfault> ryanaz: It uses event delegation so the event handler is not attached to the select bu on #fbo_fuel which is never replaced with your .load
[16:57:52] <systemfault> ryanaz: You understand what is "Event bubbling"?
[16:58:32] <ryanaz> I read a little about it last night
[16:58:54] <ryanaz> what's interesting is if I pull that syntax out of the function it stops working
[16:58:59] <ryanaz> it has to initialize after the load.
[16:59:13] <ryanaz> probaly because it doesn't exist until after the first time it runs
[16:59:45] <ryanaz> yah there we go.... i put it into the ready area, and that worked
[16:59:53] <systemfault> Yeah :P
[16:59:58] <ryanaz> and it still works after the load without needing to do it again
[17:00:12] <systemfault> Everything you put in a ready is actually executed when the whole body is parsed.
[17:00:21] <ryanaz> systemfault:  makes sense now ..
[17:00:41] <ryanaz> so I was kinda' doing it right but attaching to an element that was getting jacked aroudn by the load
[17:01:04] <ryanaz> systemfault:  is there a way to attach to a specific select?  or is it just doing it to any select?
[17:01:23] <systemfault> ryanaz: just replace 'select' with the id of the one you want
[17:02:20] <ryanaz> sweet...
[17:02:22] <ryanaz> that's awesome
[17:02:26] <ryanaz> woohoo
[17:03:49] <systemfault> ryanaz: If you're serious about event handling… understand bubbling and event delegation, it's very important.
[17:04:17] <ryanaz> i'll read about that for sure
[17:04:22] <systemfault> Also...
[17:04:43] <systemfault> ryanaz: Populating selects with markup is a bit… weird :/
[17:05:06] <ryanaz> i'm a weird dude... if you really know what I was up to you'd probably lock me up
[17:05:15] <ryanaz> (ok not that weird... )
[17:05:17] <systemfault> Your might eventually want to use ajax to get JSON that represents all the options then you'd construct the markup in JS
[17:05:33] <systemfault> It would be lighter
[17:05:36] <ryanaz> but I'm probably breaking a bazillion html/css/json rules
[17:05:39] <systemfault> :P
[17:09:37] <grantg> hey systemfault
[17:09:44] <systemfault> Hey!
[17:12:35] <grantg> systemfault: To shut up the "mobile safari is fast and op" people I recently put up http://gamecenter.grantgalitz.org/iphone/
[17:12:43] <grantg> 1 fps lol
[17:13:03] <grantg> It's point was to prove the iphone's browser sucks
[17:13:09] <grantg> *Its
[17:13:54] <systemfault> Hahaha
[17:14:03] <grantg> and this is after using the apple proprietary CSS 3D extensions the hardware accelerate the canvas.
[17:14:15] <grantg> feels like IE6 all over again.
[17:14:28] <WhiteWizzard> him im having a positioning problem with animate
[17:14:48] <systemfault> grantg: Don't exagerate.. it's still only a phone browser..
[17:14:48] <WhiteWizzard> http://jsfiddle.net/2h4LL/7/
[17:14:52] <greggies> is that directCanvas? the thing that's supposed to be so fast?
[17:14:54] <systemfault> grantg: How about android?
[17:15:03] <grantg> It should run on all
[17:15:05] <systemfault> grantg: Or even the latest chrome for android beta?
[17:15:12] <WhiteWizzard> when it is done animating, the box changes position
[17:15:13] <grantg> it supports touch AND keyboard events
[17:15:37] <grantg> not sure about chrome on android
[17:15:45] <grantg> would be interesting to see that
[17:16:13] <grantg> oh god, my mom's maine coon is trying to get my brownie... BAD KITTEH
[17:17:14] <grantg> I disabled audio on that page as iOS doesn't support real time audio for web pages
[17:17:23] <WhiteWizzard> help?
[17:18:39] <grantg> systemfault: Someone needs to make google chrome mobile for iOS
[17:18:46] <grantg> for jailbroken phones
[17:18:50] <grantg> :/
[17:18:54] <systemfault> :P
[17:19:01] <grantg> mobile safari is a joke
[17:19:23] <grantg> "new in iOS 4.3+, faster js" - BIGGEST LIE EVER TOLD BY APPLE
[17:19:29] <grantg> same speed as 4.0
[17:19:31] <grantg> in 5.1.1
[17:20:06] <grantg> If it's faster, it's < 10%
[17:20:13] <grantg> of a difference
[17:32:04] <phidev> grantg, are you saying Chrome performs better on Androids?
[17:32:56] <grantg> I'm saying mobile safari sucks on iOS
[17:33:08] <grantg> and needs replacement
[17:37:21] <cluelesscoder> hey, I'm looking for a some help using the .each function - over at http://www.badcapitalist.com/list.html I'm able to pull some data and loop through it but with identical code and a different set of data, it is not working
[17:38:47] <grantg> phidev: Mobile Safari on the latest iOS version is capping out FPS at 3 fps for some stuff WITH hardware acceleration.
[17:38:58] <cluelesscoder> the "Get stock data" is the button that's not working while "Get countries" works
[17:39:02] <grantg> while desktop browsers w/o hardware acceleration can do it with 60 fps
[17:39:42] <phidev> grantg, there are typically reasons for this. For example fixing the scale at 1x or 2x improves framerate.
[17:39:48] <grantg> I did
[17:40:00] <grantg> used the viewport stuff for the meta tags
[17:40:05] <grantg> and used css 3d transforms
[17:40:17] <grantg> fucking browser sucks
[17:41:33] <shoky> cluelesscoder: you have <body> instead of <tbody> :P
[17:41:45] <phidev> grantg, probably battery life considerations. Who knows. But it's not JS performance, it's a rendering stack limit.
[17:42:10] <grantg> phidev: Rendering pressure is low
[17:42:19] <grantg> there's a putimagedata that targets 60 fps
[17:42:22] <phidev> "Pressure"?
[17:42:25] <grantg> and a drawimage at 60 fps
[17:42:39] <grantg> if mobile safari can't do that, then I'm calling b.s.
[17:42:56] <phidev> Maybe it can do it, but they don't want you to do it.
[17:43:01] <phidev> Because it'll zap battery life.
[17:43:13] <cluelesscoder> shoky: geez, thanks...
[17:43:20] <grantg> then I presume mobile safari can't do shit
[17:43:29] <phidev> I'm sorry you're so angry.
[17:43:32] <grantg> and canvas is just a toy that breaks on everything. :P
[17:43:37] <phidev> File a radar, grantg.
[17:43:42] <phidev> Ah.
[17:43:51] <grantg> ?
[17:44:08] <phidev> Apple's bug system is called "Radar", grantg.
[17:44:14] <grantg> ah
[17:44:36] <grantg> They need to admit mobile safari sucks and let others in
[17:44:58] <grantg> just saw google chrome mobile on an android runs way faster
[17:45:15] <grantg> not even close
[17:46:49] <grantg> phidev: Also webworkers are broken in mobile safari
[17:46:58] <grantg> in case anyone hasn't tested that yet
[17:46:59] <phidev> grantg, they won't let others in. But you're right to ask that Safari performs better.
[17:47:15] <phidev> So do that.
[17:47:32] <tw2113> that's apple for you grantg
[17:47:39] <grantg> webworkers are slower than the UI thread js and have a few seconds of startup delay
[17:47:43] <grantg> so basically pointless
[17:47:50] <grantg> for mobile safari
[17:47:50] <phidev> There's a reason why all the mobile malware is on Android.
[17:48:00] <phidev> And it's because they don't mark app memory as non-executable.
[17:48:09] <phidev> Apple does. This is why they can't let other browsers in.
[17:48:30] <phidev> I'm sure users prefer Safari over malware.
[17:48:44] <grantg> they made an "exception" for mobile safari
[17:48:49] <phidev> Exactly.
[17:48:51] <grantg> so I'm calling shennanigans
[17:49:03] <grantg> also modern JITs protect against attacks
[17:49:19] <cluelesscoder> shoky: another typo! thanks again
[17:49:20] <grantg> or if forced to, can use an interpreter
[17:49:24] <phidev> You don't get it. Apple maintains Safari and guarantees the OS and Safari are up to date. They can't do that for a million third party browsers.
[17:49:28] <grantg> firefox has spidermonkey
[17:49:32] <phidev> This is why the exceptions are few.
[17:49:39] <grantg> they can throw it into interp
[17:49:58] <grantg> phidev: But they let apps through the app store
[17:50:01] <shoky> cluelesscoder: lol wat
[17:50:14] <grantg> :P
[17:50:15] <phidev> grantg, yes, but not with the exec flag on.
[17:51:04] <Storm3y> I have multiple divs on a page, I'm wondering if its possible to sort those using JQuery. http://pastebin.com/zm4yyV9v
[17:51:08] <phidev> Apple doesn't hate you, they just made different choices.
[17:51:15] <grantg> then they should force it into an INTERPRETER MODE
[17:51:20] <grantg> FIREFOX CAN DO INTERP
[17:51:21] <phidev> And if people are buying their stuff, they are good choices.
[17:51:40] <phidev> No, a web browser engine is too complicated even with an interpreter.
[17:51:42] <grantg> firefox can have its jit disabled
[17:51:43] <phidev> A ton of ways to mess up.
[17:51:58] <grantg> same with other apps
[17:52:02] <phidev> Nope.
[17:52:14] <phidev> Other apps are quite basic compared to a web engine.
[17:52:15] <grantg> other apps network too
[17:52:26] <phidev> It's not about networking, it's about the entire stack.
[17:52:38] <grantg> apple's software isn't hackproof either way
[17:52:39] <grantg> it
[17:52:43] <grantg> it's not any better
[17:52:50] <phidev> It's better than Random Browser X.
[17:52:54] <grantg> see: The PDF exploit that allowed jailbreaking
[17:52:58] <grantg> not really
[17:53:01] <phidev> Because if they let Chrome in, they gotta let Firefox and Opera in.
[17:53:12] <phidev> And they gotta let Random Browser X in too.
[17:53:20] <grantg> see: jailbreaking by visiting the jailbreakme site in mobile safari
[17:53:25] <grantg> love them pdf plugins
[17:53:31] <phidev> If any one of them becomes the weakest link, iPhone becomes insecure.
[17:53:41] <xarg> I lol'd.
[17:53:43] <grantg> that was how you could jailbreak 4.0.1
[17:54:22] <phidev> Well you can be angry. Or you can file a radar and move on, grantg
[17:54:39] <grantg> phidev: The other apps can get barely reviewed code approved
[17:54:54] <grantg> more of hypocrisy
[17:55:13] <phidev> Where is the hypocrisy.
[17:55:24] <grantg> saying mobile safari is more secure
[17:55:31] <phidev> Web browsers are high risk, and since the reviewing process isn't perfect, they don't let them in.
[17:55:35] <phidev> It's very simple.
[17:55:52] <grantg> browser code is much more reviewed than third party zynga code
[17:56:04] <phidev> Much more reviewed?
[17:56:06] <phidev> by whom?
[17:56:09] <grantg> even before it hits apple's review process
[17:56:19] <grantg> by people contributing to mozilla, etc. over the years
[17:56:35] <phidev> why are you talking about Mozilla only. You want Apple to make an exception only for Mozilla?
[17:56:35] <grantg> random apps on the app store might contain highly unreviewed code
[17:56:42] <grantg> phidev: no
[17:56:45] <phidev> Are you crazy, google will sue Apple into a hole.
[17:56:48] <phidev> Well then.
[17:56:54] <phidev> It's not about Google, or Mozilla.
[17:56:57] <phidev> It's about EVERYONE.
[17:57:04] <grantg> I know it isn't
[17:57:09] <Dr-Bombay> apple is literally the only company capable of developing reliable software
[17:57:22] <phidev> Safari isn't perfect but they control it and they update it.
[17:57:23] <Dr-Bombay> the suggestion that anyone else might be able to do it is madness
[17:57:24] <grantg> phidev: they need to set a qualifying bar
[17:57:33] <grantg> so only major orgs can do it
[17:57:57] <phidev> grantg, how do you define "major org"
[17:58:06] <ryanaz> systemfault:  this javascript is doing something very bizarre now.... it seems like every time it does a '.load' it seems to append everything...
[17:58:14] <grantg> a company with hundreds of code contributors
[17:58:16] <Dr-Bombay> he defines it as Apple
[17:58:17] <ryanaz> how do I make sure it's overwriting what it had before in the <div>  ?
[17:58:19] <grantg> as a pre-qualifier
[17:58:38] <phidev> granden, so a company needs to put lots of employees on paper to qualify? What kinda nonsense...
[17:58:39] <systemfault> ryanaz: Have you specified a selector to .load?
[17:58:51] <grantg> phidev: pre-qualifier, not finalized qualifier
[17:58:59] <grantg> apple still can hold back submission
[17:59:11] <grantg> that is their right
[17:59:14] <phidev> And what problem will they solve with all this bureaucracy you want?
[17:59:20] <ryanaz> $('#fbo_fuel_update_head').load("api/fbo_fuel_update_head.cgi?id_community="+id_community+"&id_location="+id_location);
[17:59:24] <phidev> To make YOU happy, for an edge case of animating something on Safari?
[17:59:30] <phidev> Nope. They don't care about you.
[17:59:33] <phidev> They care about users.
[17:59:40] <grantg> allow end-users to override this boxed-in bullshit
[17:59:46] <Dr-Bombay> trusting outside companies to develop a browser is like trusting "doctors" to treat cancer
[17:59:51] <tw2113> is it ever a good idea to do window.onscroll = function(e) { } ?
[17:59:57] <phidev> grantg, buy android, they allow you to do this.
[18:00:06] <grantg> phidev: oh lol
[18:00:07] <systemfault> ryanaz: IIRC, you need to add the selector after the url with a space to separate them
[18:00:15] <grantg> or jailbreak your iphone
[18:00:15] <Dr-Bombay> grantg: you're such a fanboy
[18:00:38] <grantg> iOS 5.1.1 is already jailbroken (untether one too)
[18:00:52] <phidev> Dr-Bombay, instead of trolling around, you could accept the facts.
[18:00:56] <grantg> maybe google should release there then
[18:01:07] <grantg> in cydia
[18:01:14] <phidev> grantg, rumor is Chrome is coming to iOS.
[18:01:20] <phidev> But with the Safari engine...
[18:01:23] <ryanaz> systemfault:  Example?
[18:01:25] <grantg> lol
[18:01:34] <grantg> phidev: needs the V8 engine to be useful
[18:01:56] <grantg> jsc is crap
[18:01:58] <grantg> on iOS
[18:02:09] <grantg> can't do much there
[18:02:09] <systemfault> ryanaz: It's the same page that you load?
[18:02:16] <ryanaz> ya
[18:02:18] <phidev> grantg, V8 is on par with Safari's JIT. The problem is the rendering stack with Safari.
[18:02:26] <systemfault> ryanaz: Then it's okay.. it should work as is
[18:02:31] <grantg> phidev: doesn't feel like it
[18:02:33] <grantg> gtg
[18:02:49] <ryanaz> yah, it's doing weird things ...
[18:02:51] <systemfault> JSC is a lot slower than V8..
[18:02:58] <systemfault> It's not just the rendering.
[18:03:08] <Dr-Bombay> or did I get it wrong and phidev was the fanboy?
[18:03:25] <systemfault> Dr-Bombay: Does it really matter? :/
[18:03:36] <ryanaz> systemfault:  on the web server it's actually going an expontial amounts of loads.. because I'm also re-loading the function each time in the same div..
[18:03:38] <ryanaz> that's probably the problem.
[18:04:07] <systemfault> ryanaz: You should really create JSON services for your selects :P
[18:04:29] <ryanaz> lol yah, i just want to see this work first... then i'll understnat how this works..
[18:04:40] <ryanaz> then re-do it all the other way
[18:07:01] <ryanaz> fixed it..
[18:07:08] <systemfault> :P
[18:07:12] <ryanaz> it was re-loading the script every time.
[18:07:34] <systemfault> Ah
[18:07:42] <ryanaz> I think the bigger problem is it kept attaching the load() to the select each time over and over and over again
[18:08:49] <bobbytek2> can $.when accept an array?
[18:09:11] <shoky> $.when.apply can
[18:09:56] <shoky> e.g. $.when.apply($, arrayOfPromises).then(...)
[18:19:54] <tw2113> my god i'm typo happy tonight
[18:28:20] <Blaster> Hey guys, I have a mouseenter event which does an animation.  How would I prevent the handler from being called again once the animation is running,  but apply the handler again once the animation is through?
[18:28:58] <Blaster> It's repeatedly firing the animation if the user mouses out and then back in.
[19:02:33] <ndss56> hi, where can i find a site which can provide a url for pictures to use in jsfiddle?
[19:03:10] <tw2113> direct linking doesn't work?
[19:03:29] <ndss56> don't know. first i need a website.
[19:03:51] <tw2113> ndss56 http://jsfiddle.net/CW4xy/
[19:04:01] <tw2113> grabbed from google+ just now
[19:04:50] <ndss56> tw2113: i c. ok. i will search for somthing that has a shorter url :)
[19:05:42] <tw2113> i don't mean this against you specifically, but another example ndss56 http://jsfiddle.net/CW4xy/1/
[19:06:15] <tw2113> if it's online already, chances are high that you can use it in a fiddle
[19:07:58] <ndss56> tw2113: lol. ok.
[19:09:04] <ndss56> tw2113: Was actually looking for a site which just has a bunch of images that people load up i could use.
[19:12:50] <tw2113> google image search ;)
[19:15:05] <ndss56> tw2113: That has long urls
[19:15:19] <tw2113> depends on the source
[19:15:25] <tw2113> i wonder if shorturls would render
[19:16:16] <tw2113> eh probably not
[19:16:20] <ndss56> something like www.foo.com/shadg.pjg
[19:16:33] <tw2113> http://placekitten.com/
[19:18:01] <ndss56> tw2113: cheers. that is short enough.
[19:18:09] <tw2113> and ubercute
[19:19:05] <ndss56> tw2113: not that cat.
[19:19:35] <ndss56> tw2113: although it does look more cute in color.
[19:21:17] <Storm3y> Hi guys, anyone know what Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'on' means?
[19:22:45] <systemfault> Storm3y: You're trying to call .on on an object that isn't a jQuery object
[19:22:53] <systemfault> Most likely.. a DOM node
[19:23:12] <Storm3y> Hmm
[19:23:26] <kaepora> Hey!
[19:23:40] <Storm3y> http://pastebin.com/7Bhq3z2G
[19:23:42] <kaepora> Why is it that when I abort a single ajax query using .abort();, all subsequent queries don't work?
[19:24:01] <Storm3y> This is the code I have, according to chrome it says the error is occuring with $('.sort_buttons a').on('click', function(e) {
[19:24:54] <systemfault> Storm3y: Perhaps you're using an ancient version of jQuery
[19:25:10] <systemfault> Storm3y: What version are you using?
[19:25:14] <Storm3y> jquery-1.6.3.js
[19:25:18] <systemfault> That's why
[19:25:24] <Storm3y> :P - sorry forgot to check that.
[19:25:26] <systemfault> Storm3y: .on was added in 1.7
[19:25:36] <Storm3y> 1.7.1 is latest right?
[19:25:39] <systemfault> 1.7.2
[19:25:45] <Storm3y> Ah ok
[19:27:57] <kaepora> Guys?
[19:34:10] <_cS> word... press
[19:34:30] <roddd> what is the best approach the re-instantiate plugins in your code?
[19:34:50] <roddd> let's say you instantiate it once on document load, then must re-instantiate it again after an ajax call
[19:35:14] <roddd> your code gets bloated fast
[19:35:53] <roddd> maybe set a function that will instantiate or re-instantiate it as needed/you call it?
[19:36:49] <Storm3y> Cheers systemfault - that seemed to of fixed the error, just need to figure out why the script wont work in Wordpress now.
[19:37:05] <systemfault> :)
[19:41:17] <oojacoboo> what would be the best way to find an element if it might exist within the parent or it might exist outside the parent down the DOM a ways?  Would you use find() and a conditional statement and then use another method to find it it's down the DOM?  If so, what method would be best for finding if it's down the DOM a ways?
[19:42:01] <oojacoboo> I don't have any way of accurately predicting what the DOM structure will be after this container, and there could be multiple instances of these on a page
[19:42:09] <oojacoboo> I just need to find the "closest" one
[19:44:00] <shoky> kaepora: it should work fine. (for example: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fTUKr/1/ )
[19:44:08] <mykul> oojacoboo, what do you meet closest
[19:44:12] <mykul> mean*
[19:44:42] <oojacoboo> I have a button that I need to target that for reasons of complexity must sit outside of the <form> in some rare occasions
[19:45:04] <oojacoboo> I need to be able to get this button within the <form> which is passed to this function for setting a number of things
[19:45:07] <kaepora> shoky: OK, thank you, I will keep tinkering
[19:45:23] <oojacoboo> or if it exists outside the form, get it there as well
[19:45:50] <oojacoboo> and by closest, I mean, just that really, the next instance of that element after the <form>
[19:46:04] <oojacoboo> not closest() ;)
[19:46:07] <mykul> haha okay
[19:46:42] <mykul> so which would be closer:
[19:47:17] <mykul> the button buried in the next sibling element to the form, or the button itself as a sibling several siblings beneath the form
[19:48:18] <oojacoboo> the nested button next in line down the DOM
[19:48:23] <oojacoboo> regardless of the parent
[19:48:31] <oojacoboo> the first example
[19:49:09] <mykul> okay, then given what you've told i think you had it right
[19:50:17] <oojacoboo> what do you mean, I had it right
[19:50:19] <mykul> you walk up the DOM, doing  a deep seach of each sibling in order
[19:50:41] <oojacoboo> up the DOM?
[19:50:46] <mykul> toward the root
[19:50:49] <mykul> of the tree
[19:51:05] <oojacoboo> na, I need to walk down the DOM starting with <form> and find the first instance
[19:51:26] <oojacoboo> where button[type="submit"]
[19:52:03] <oojacoboo> I'm going to use find() for the most common scenario, but is there a method for looking for an element after another element?
[19:52:14] <oojacoboo> digging through the nestings?
[19:52:23] <shoky> .nextAll ?
[19:52:38] <shoky> or .next
[19:52:39] <tw2113> $('#myform input[type="submit"]') ?
[19:52:55] <oojacoboo> tw2113, no
[19:53:23] <thinkerbell> oojacoboo, why not just give it an id
[19:53:42] <shoky> cause im hacking some shiattt
[19:53:44] <oojacoboo> b/c this is global code that covers about 100+ instances
[19:54:00] <oojacoboo> and many pages share multiple buttons and a single ID wouldn't cover it
[19:54:24] <thinkerbell> oojacoboo, there is a method for looking for an element after another element, like siblings
[19:54:41] <oojacoboo> thinkerbell, what is it?
[19:55:09] <thinkerbell> oojacoboo, siblings()
[19:55:25] <oojacoboo> yea, but that doesn't dive into the nestings, right?
[19:55:50] <shoky> you won't find a magic function to do your work for you
[19:55:59] <mykul> might have to write  abit of recursion
[19:56:00] <thinkerbell> oojacoboo, children()
[19:56:06] <shoky> call find() on whatever you think is neccessary, and only you know that
[19:57:32] <shoky> donno why it should be neccessary in the first place to find some button where you dont really know  where to look for it....
[19:58:05] <thinkerbell> oojacoboo, shoky is right, it's not clear to us what you are trying to do, but whatever it is you are trying to do, it can be done
[19:58:26] <oojacoboo> I know it can be done, I was just trying to find out what the best method might be
[19:58:41] <shoky> that would depend on what you need, which you haven't specified in much detail
[19:58:58] <shoky> the best method would probably be to avoid having to search the DOM in the first place
[19:59:14] <thinkerbell> foreach()?
[19:59:28] <oojacoboo> umm this isn't php?
[19:59:31] <shoky> hm?
[19:59:39] <oojacoboo> $.each() you mean?
[19:59:49] <thinkerbell> oojacoboo, http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[19:59:52] <mykul> well, since you have a notion of closest and the form element.  You just need to work your way out from the form in such a way that the first tim eyou hit the button you are sure it is the closest one.
[20:00:06] <shoky> ^^
[20:00:22] <oojacoboo> mykul, yes, exactly
[20:00:27] <oojacoboo> but only down
[20:00:44] <tw2113> isn't there a first() ?
[20:00:52] <oojacoboo> yes
[20:00:55] <mykul> only down is easier because you can disregard and prevs and focus just on nexts
[20:01:41] <oojacoboo> tw2113, first() is like first-child pseudo selector though
[20:01:41] <mykul> so do a depth first search of al siblings to your form, if you cant find it, step up a level and search all the next siblings of the parent of your form, etc
[20:02:05] <shoky> oojacoboo: may i ask why you need to search like this in the first place?
[20:02:34] <oojacoboo> shoky, I did explain it earlier, but basically b/c in some cases for complex layout reasons, I have to have a button that lies outside of the form
[20:02:45] <systemfault> o_O
[20:02:46] <shoky> yeah that sums up to
[20:02:48] <shoky> 'its complex'
[20:02:50] <oojacoboo> yea yea yea yea
[20:02:51] <oojacoboo> yea
[20:02:52] <oojacoboo> yea
[20:02:58] <shoky> righto
[20:03:01] <oojacoboo> yep
[20:03:06] <shoky> ok so i may not ask ;)
[20:03:41] <shoky> oojacoboo: even if you have to have that button there
[20:03:44] <oojacoboo> jumping to conclusions like that doesn't really get anyone anywhere shoky
[20:03:45] <shoky> why do you need to search for it?
[20:03:51] <shoky> what conclusions?
[20:03:58] <tw2113> adding an id to it still sounds best to me
[20:04:01] <systemfault> ?eval new Array(100).join('Yea ');
[20:04:01] <drojas> any convention or common practice to concatenate functions?
[20:04:08] <bot-t> systemfault: No output. (Process Killed)
[20:04:16] <oojacoboo> patronizing me with "it's complex"
[20:04:24] <shoky> huh how is that patronizing
[20:04:25] <drojas> I need to be sure one function is executed right after other
[20:04:34] <oojacoboo> when in fact the DOM is a complex layout, otherwise I wouldn't put the button outside the form
[20:04:36] <tw2113> drojas chain them ?
[20:04:37] <shoky> i asked a question and you gave no answer, i was just stating that..
[20:04:39] <oojacoboo> since that's just stupid
[20:04:39] <drojas> yes
[20:04:42] <drojas> chain them
[20:05:13] <shoky> oojacoboo: i was just asking you about it to get more detail on your problem. and i failed in getting that
[20:05:22] <shoky> oojacoboo: sorry if you felt i was patronizing
[20:05:52] <shoky> still donno what conclusions you're talking about :\
[20:06:37] <oojacoboo> I just need to find the next instance of a submit button after a <form> if it doesn't exist within it
[20:06:45] <oojacoboo> regardless of nesting
[20:06:47] <shoky> 'after' is too general
[20:07:14] <oojacoboo> yes, I realize, <form></form><div><div><div><button>
[20:07:20] <oojacoboo> that's after
[20:07:21] <shoky> for example
[20:07:31] <tw2113> and what was wrong with an ID?
[20:07:31] <oojacoboo> and is priority over...
[20:07:51] <oojacoboo> yes, I realize, <form></form><div><div><div></div></div></div><button>
[20:08:10] <oojacoboo> tw2113, I already stated that an ID won't work b/c there might be more than one button
[20:08:19] <tw2113> and they can't have their own IDs?
[20:08:30] <tw2113> or are you afraid they'd end up sharing one?
[20:08:58] <tw2113> why can't the divs and button go inside the <form> tag?
[20:08:59] <oojacoboo> tw2113, you can't have elements sharing an ID
[20:09:05] <tw2113> i know that
[20:09:08] <oojacoboo> ok then?
[20:09:09] <tw2113> give each their own
[20:09:15] <oojacoboo> ummm no thanks
[20:09:24] <oojacoboo> there are hundreds of these pages
[20:09:47] <tw2113> are you going to be selecting every single one at some point? or just this one?
[20:10:04] <shoky> what are you gonna do with the button once you find it?
[20:10:18] <shoky> bind events?
[20:10:19] <oojacoboo> add a class, make it disabled
[20:12:15] <shoky> when/how is the button added to the DOM?
[20:12:31] <oojacoboo> it's built out with php, no js
[20:12:43] <oojacoboo> well, in this one case I'm on now at least
[20:12:47] <oojacoboo> I'm not sure about all instances
[20:13:01] <oojacoboo> some will be ajax
[20:16:23] <malvin> hi there, i have some issue
[20:16:27] <malvin> i have a option
[20:16:55] <oojacoboo> I'm just going to use an optional parameter in the method signature to pass the ID in the instances where it doesn't exist within the form
[20:17:07] <oojacoboo> that should do fine
[20:17:35] <shoky> avoiding the search, yes
[20:17:38] <tw2113> *shrug*
[20:17:47] <shoky> indeed
[20:20:01] <oojacoboo> btw, https://gist.github.com/d5e708b5e95385410fcd
[20:21:19] <snover> not all form fields support readonly
[20:21:38] <oojacoboo> I guess it'll just not work on them then, no?
[20:22:11] <oojacoboo> that code does work well and has been for a couple years
[20:22:47] <tw2113> sup snover
[20:23:04] <snover> tw2113: just hangin and chillin
[20:24:58] <Lyfesaver> anyone have a good tip on where to find a js that displays the servers CPU load? Like a javascript CPU meter? I found JPU, but it does not appear to be very accurate =(
[20:25:24] <oojacoboo> server CPU load is server side, js is client side
[20:25:39] <oojacoboo> you can't do that, you need a backend language to pass that to js if you want to use it with js
[20:25:54] <Lyfesaver> gotcha
[20:25:58] <Lyfesaver> makes total sense
[20:25:59] <Lyfesaver> thx
[20:26:26] <Lyfesaver> i can find a way to do it in C# then.. as it is a MVC using razor... thx =)
[20:26:36] <oojacoboo> np
[20:27:01] <Lyfesaver> would have spent another hour looking if someone had not pointed out the obvoius to me =)
[20:27:07] <Lyfesaver> lol
[20:40:18] <malvin> i have issue with this one http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/1/
[20:40:27] <malvin> can someone help me
[20:40:47] <malvin> so insertafter() only work on each tr, i mean "reset" on every tr
[20:40:59] <malvin> <tr>
[20:41:10] <malvin> right now is work on every tr
[20:42:15] <thinkt4nk> ? tr?
[20:42:17] <bot-t> thinkt4nk, :last Selector - Selects the last matched element. http://api.jquery.com/last-selector/
[20:42:23] <thinkt4nk> you're working with an unordered list
[20:43:01] <malvin> <tr> = a table row
[20:43:27] <thinkt4nk> I know what a tr is.  You don't even have a table in your example
[20:44:19] <oojacoboo> malvin, you know there is a css property for this?
[20:44:38] <malvin> i will make clear on css so easy to understand
[20:44:55] <oojacoboo> malvin, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/counter-increment
[20:45:16] <oojacoboo> don't use js to do what css can
[20:45:33] <systemfault> Unless you want to support ie7..
[20:45:40] <oojacoboo> I don't care
[20:45:48] <oojacoboo> still a bad idea in my opinion
[20:46:17] <oojacoboo> he should be using a backend lang for that if he wants ie7 support
[20:46:42] <oojacoboo> unless it's some strange case we he can't
[20:46:52] <malvin> please check again http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/1/
[20:47:22] <malvin> if you see my 2 product
[20:47:40] <thinkt4nk> still an unordered list
[20:47:41] <malvin> there have sku like : sku: ALBLUE, sku: ALPURPLE
[20:48:05] <malvin> right now its repeated on 2 product
[20:49:00] <malvin> my question is, how to make insertafter() work on .product and reset again.
[20:49:10] <malvin> right now is insert on 2 product instead one by one.
[20:49:58] <malvin> http://jsfiddle.net/vSyK6/16/
[20:50:04] <malvin> sorry forget to update
[20:52:59] <malvin> its a dynamic value on magento, and i cant move it on code, so i try to use jquery
[22:51:03] <cluelesscoder> hmm
[22:52:14] <rabbi1> how can i use both a href and onclick function together . i want to check for condition onclick function and if true the a href should work, else not... but i need a href to remain their always.....
[22:58:33] <joelbirch> if true, don't preventDefault() or return false
[23:06:11] <rabbi1> joelbirch: can i use "<a href="javascript:void(0)"> something like this ?
[23:06:48] <joelbirch> I thought you meant you will have a proper path in the href
[23:07:09] <joelbirch> what do you mean "the href should work"?
[23:07:51] <rabbi1> joelbirch: ok thank you, that's actually a jquery tab so wanted to prevent it for styles from jquery .... think that will work
[23:08:26] <rabbi1> joelbirch: initially i removed href, and then the styles were all weired.....
[23:09:03] <thomedy> so according to jquery website the official one i can do a .load with a legitimate selector in the url and i can get jus tthat info
[23:09:12] <thomedy> i can pull the url and but i cant pull just the selector
[23:09:15] <thomedy> no bueno
[23:10:01] <joelbirch> only ID selector
[23:11:19] <thomedy> i just checked just in case i am using an id
[23:11:32] <thomedy> i thought i was but incase it was just a simple error like that i needed to make sure
[23:11:35] <thomedy> but it is an id
[23:12:00] <thomedy> my .load is .load(url_variable + '#container');
[23:12:05] <joelbirch> hmm. Not sure I've actually used that feature, but it should work. Pastebin?
[23:12:17] <thomedy> no worries here it comes
[23:12:50] <systemfault> thomedy: You have a space between the URL and the selector?
[23:13:38] <tga> in jquery mobile how would you organize the js so that you can load multiple dynamic pages with xhr and allow them to manage load/unload events?
[23:14:24] <thomedy> yeah in fact its var + '#selector'
[23:15:58] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/XE9qE4TW
[23:17:28] <joelbirch> thomedy what does this.href resolve to in this case? Are you sure you don't need to add or remove a trailing slash?
[23:19:22] <Carlitta87> hey guys im trying to make a lil function where if i enter into a text box the select box will change. the problem is i have 4 forms that have the same input. therefore the change only happens to the first one. here's an idea of the issue with jsfiddle.http://jsfiddle.net/sKSFm/
[23:19:51] <Carlitta87> i would honestly appreciate any assistance, as i know this shudnt be a difficult problem but i am unsure wat to do at this point
[23:20:02] <thomedy> you know i wrote that code n i doont know what trailing slash you mean
[23:20:34] <Carlitta87> thomedy: r u talking to me?
[23:20:45] <thomedy> no im sorry joelbirch was the target
[23:20:56] <joelbirch> I mean, maybe http://google.com#selector is different to http://google.com/#selector
[23:21:00] <joelbirch> note the slash
[23:21:10] <thomedy> oh your saying i need one
[23:21:18] <joelbirch> I'm saying you might
[23:21:25] <thomedy> let me check
[23:23:10] <tga> no takers on the jquery mobile layout?
[23:23:29] <tga> any good examples of application structure?
[23:23:31] <joelbirch> tga I haven't used jQuery mobile
[23:23:51] <thomedy> that didn't work by the way im re reading the api.jquery.com/load
[23:23:54] <tga> the quirk is that the lib loads pages with xhr and inserts them into the DOM
[23:24:07] <tga> so you don't get a regular page lifecycle
[23:24:20] <thomedy> it needs a space...
[23:24:38] <tga> my pages are just <div>s with a <script> in them
[23:25:25] <thomedy> this has no bearing on anything but has anyone seen this website
[23:25:28] <thomedy> www.beetle.com
[23:25:30] <thomedy> its dope
[23:26:13] <joelbirch> thomedy the docs have this example
[23:26:13] <joelbirch> $('#b').load('article.html #target');
[23:26:28] <joelbirch> throw a space in before the selector
[23:26:36] <thomedy> yeah i read that too
[23:26:38] <thomedy> it works now
[23:26:43] <joelbirch> cool
[23:26:45] <thomedy> i skipped over the space when i read it
[23:26:51] <thomedy> thank you
[23:27:11] <joelbirch> looks like systemfault had it right further up
[23:27:23] <systemfault> Heh.
[23:27:25] <systemfault> :/
[23:27:46] <thomedy> im kind of psyched i have now accomplished a goal i have wondered if i could do for probably 4 months
[23:27:56] <thomedy> yay
[23:28:22] <Carlitta87> yay
[23:28:25] <Carlitta87> my turn? lol
[23:28:34] <Carlitta87> please

[23:29:26] <Carlitta87> shud i repost?
[23:29:36] <systemfault> Yeah
[23:29:59] <Carlitta87> hey guys im trying to make a lil function where if i enter into a text box the selectbox will change. the problem is i have 4 forms that have the same input. therefore the change only happens to the first one. here's an idea of the issue with jsfiddle.http://jsfiddle.net/sKSFm/

[23:34:22] <thomedy> thank you joel birch
[23:34:27] <thomedy> hey last question
[23:34:45] <systemfault> Carlitta87: Seems I'm an idiot because I don't understand what you would like to do… at all
[23:34:46] <thomedy> the thing that im doing is a degraded version when webgl isn't an option for the user
[23:35:07] <thomedy> i am designing a 3d version with webgl aftyer i finish this one
[23:35:20] <thomedy> that  being said im noticing some problems with webgle
[23:35:25] <thomedy> security being one
[23:35:33] <thomedy> and difficulty of use
[23:35:35] <thomedy> for some machines
[23:35:40] <systemfault> Why security?
[23:35:50] <systemfault> Difficulty to use… yeah, I agree
[23:35:52] <thomedy> i jus tread that i couldn't figure it out eityher
[23:35:53] <thomedy> either
[23:36:03] <systemfault> WebGL is a too-low level API for a browser
[23:36:26] <thomedy> it is dope and iwant to utilize it but im thinking i might go flash soon
[23:36:28] <thomedy> i dont knokw
[23:36:29] <Carlitta87> systemdefault: ok. i have 4 forms with the same fields but seperated by tabs and has its own DIV...i would like to allow the user to type in one of the textboxes of whichever form...and for that form the select field in that form will change....
[23:36:45] <Carlitta87> what i've done in js fiddle... only works for the first form
[23:36:47] <thomedy> difficulty doesn't stop me ever
[23:36:49] <thomedy> ever
[23:36:53] <thomedy> but security might
[23:36:53] <Carlitta87> but not for the 2nd 3rd or 4th
[23:37:28] <systemfault> Carlitta87: What works… as soon as I enter anything in the input, the select is modified to "no value"
[23:38:11] <Carlitta87> yes...but in my second tab, this doesnt work. would u like to see the actual thing im working with?
[23:38:41] <systemfault> If it can help me understand the point, sure
[23:38:49] <Carlitta87> systemdefault: http://demo.devmediastudios.com/cbjamaica/index.php
[23:39:11] <Carlitta87> systemfault: http://demo.devmediastudios.com/cbjamaica/index.php
[23:39:18] <systemfault> Ok..
[23:39:20] <Carlitta87> sry i got ur name wrong :/
[23:39:22] <systemfault> Now what?
[23:39:32] <Carlitta87> the first page
[23:39:35] <Carlitta87> u see a search area
[23:39:41] <iwoj> jquery css width stuff always annoys me.
[23:39:46] <Carlitta87> the first tab is residential
[23:39:58] <Carlitta87> wen u enter into the field PID/MLS

[23:42:10] <briansoule> is it .position()?
[23:42:21] <systemfault> Carlitta87: rewrite the code so it uses classes instead of ids
