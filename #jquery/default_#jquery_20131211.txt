[00:11:27] <taherali> is it mandatory to use document ready function?
[00:12:31] <Cork> taherali: depends on where you put your code
[00:12:51] <Cork> taherali: ready helps you wait for the dom to stabilize if your code is in the head
[00:13:13] <Cork> taherali: if you put your code in onload or at the bottom of the body, then no you don't need it
[00:13:17] <taherali> so the code will not execute unless and until the DOM is ready.
[00:13:35] <Cork> it waits for the DOMContentLoaded or onload event
[00:14:06] <Cork> it has a fallback for onload if domcontentloaded isn't supported by the browser
[00:17:20] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:25:16] <sijmon2003> Good morning all
[00:28:42] <taherali> Cork: I need some help with Custom Scroll bar.
[00:30:10] <anli> Is the possibility to resize down the width of the browser window newly limited in firefox?
[00:30:33] <Cork> anli: no
[00:30:52] <anli> Seems like some style is in play then
[00:30:52] <Cork> that limit has been the default for ages
[00:30:59] <anli> ok
[00:31:04] <anli> Is it settable?
[00:31:22] <Cork> about:config?filter=dom.disable_window_move_resize
[00:32:12] <anli> Is not really a measure
[00:32:25] <anli> true och false, can I make the window non resizable? heh
[00:32:27] <anli> thanks
[00:32:49] <Cork> anli: if you want to disable the resize feature set the value to true
[00:33:05] <anli> Oh, I only want to make firefox windows more narrow
[00:33:42] <Cork> anli: ah you mean for the user
[00:33:50] <Cork> no there is more or less no limit to the width
[00:33:52] <anli> ah, yeah, sorry
[00:34:04] <anli> Strange
[00:34:05] <Cork> unless you have an extension that somehow forces it
[00:34:14] <anli> Must be that
[00:34:22] <anli> It has not been like that before, as said
[00:34:57] <Cork> anli: though you can use the responsive design mode
[00:36:10] <Aquaword> morning
[00:36:22] <anli> The limit I have: http://snag.gy/RMtAa.jpg
[00:36:23] <Cork> taherali: if you need help you need to ask the question
[00:36:28] <Aquaword> guys how to add repeating to the following code? http://hastebin.com/senawereko.coffee
[00:36:49] <Aquaword> so if it reach the last item, start with item 1
[00:36:52] <Cork> anli: looks like it's from the toolbar buttons
[00:37:09] <anli> bookmarks then?
[00:37:21] <Cork> that is one element
[00:37:29] <Cork> and the element adjusts to width
[00:37:34] <Cork> button doesn't
[00:37:46] <Cork> and the addressbar and search bar is at min width
[00:38:56] <Aquaword> Cork, any idea?
[00:39:15] <anli> Why cant those bars just be hidden if the window goes narrow?
[00:40:34] <Cork> Aquaword: you would have to rewrite it so it isn't sync
[00:40:38] <anli> Like IE, it hides the search field if the window goes narrow
[00:40:57] <Cork> Aquaword: right now you are seriously getting racy, and if you add another loop you will get even worse
[00:41:00] <anli> oh, wait, it does not, it hides the new window tab
[00:41:18] <anli> And the toolbar icons
[00:41:19] <Aquaword> Cork: it comes from stackoverflow..
[00:41:20] <Cork> anli: some of this has been worked on in the new theme
[00:41:25] <anli> ok
[00:41:27] <Cork> Aquaword: figures
[00:42:03] <Cork> so is sadly a good place for lots of bad suggestions
[00:42:43] <Cork> there are some gold nuggets, but you have to know how to filter out all the bad
[00:43:40] <Aquaword> its true. this code is the best i found (rotates trough DIVs and highlights them one-by-one) but stops at the end of list
[00:43:57] <Aquaword> so fully rewrite helps only?
[00:44:12] <Cork> Aquaword: the big problem is it generates an animation synctonically
[00:44:20] <Cork> instead of waiting for each step to happen
[00:44:39] <Cork> and it doesn't take into account if the computer gets busy so the timer offset
[00:44:45] <Cork> and loads of other problems
[00:45:08] <Cork> Aquaword: firstly you should move it to use a date stamp so it actually does the animation step expected
[00:45:35] <Cork> then add support for requestAnimationFrame so you can speed it up without the use of setTimeout for browsers that supports that
[00:45:58] <Cork> and possibly even better use css3 animation instead and just skip the js animation all together
[00:46:27] <Aquaword> i see
[00:46:43] <Cork> but as it is written right now it is broken
[00:47:00] <Cork> doing setTimeout in a for loop is asking for problems
[00:47:30] <Cork> especially if you expect them to run after each other like in your code snippet
[00:54:08] <ph88> i'm loosing track of all the events going on in my JS app ... how can i get an overview? should i manually draw a map ?
[00:54:53] <Cork> ph88: writing them statically with delegate normally helps a lot
[00:55:09] <ph88> Cork: i don't know what that is
[00:55:28] <Cork> defining them close to where the widget or similar that handles it is also helps
[00:55:44] <Cork> and stone hardly forbidding inline event listeners is a biggie
[00:55:55] <ph88> what does this mean "statically with delegate"  ?
[00:56:09] <Cork> ph88: add event listeners to a static parent
[00:56:15] <Cork> and let it handle all the children
[00:56:21] <Cork> instead of adding event listeners in a loop
[00:56:29] <ph88> oh delegate it that it forward events to child ?
[00:56:38] <Cork> things like that makes it much easier to structure the code
[00:56:46] <Cork> ph88: uh, no
[00:56:50] <ph88> i have high coupling too
[00:56:52] <Cork> it listens for bubbling events
[00:57:16] <Cork> so it captures the event on a parent and check where it came from
[00:57:27] <ph88> is this something you are talking about ?  http://www.sitepoint.com/event-delegation-with-jquery/
[00:57:54] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:58:07] <Cork> you can express it with .on too
[00:58:18] <ph88> i do that all the time ??
[00:58:20] <Cork> but be sure to read the delegate page first, else you most likely will use on wrong
[00:58:42] <Cork> ph88: only for situations where you need to target multiple targets
[00:58:52] <Cork> or the target is dynamically added and removed
[00:59:03] <ph88> ah this i don't do    $( "table" ).on( "click", "td", function() {   with td
[01:00:00] <ph88> what's the difference   $( "table" ).on( "click", "td", function() {   and    $( "table td" ).on( "click", function() {
[01:00:15] <Cork> ph88: the first one is delegated
[01:00:19] <Cork> the second on is a plain bind
[01:00:28] <Cork> the second one binds an event listener to each td
[01:00:35] <ph88> aahh
[01:00:37] <Cork> and if you add new tds they won't have a listener
[01:00:52] <Cork> while the first one adds a listener to each table
[01:01:04] <Cork> and any td you add to any of those tables will trigger the event handler
[01:01:15] <Cork> (on click)
[01:01:16] <ph88> could i do   $( "table" ).on( "click", "tbody td", function() {    ?
[01:01:22] <Cork> yes
[01:01:25] <ph88> nice
[01:01:27] <ph88> thx Cork
[01:01:46] <Cork> any selector that starts at the table works
[01:02:01] <Cork> actually any selector that matches the target works :)
[01:02:15] <ph88> :)
[01:11:22] <sijmon2003> hey guys
[01:11:37] <sijmon2003> ph88: can you maybe help me a little bit :)?
[01:12:07] <ph88> just ask your question
[01:13:27] <imjakechapman> hey everyone
[01:13:56] <mehrdad> hey peeps
[01:14:32] <mehrdad> i want to execute a bunch of code after jquery validation attaches to the form elements, does anyone know how this can be done?
[01:15:02] <fosser_josh> HI guys, I am creating call button in callback function. and adding button click event outside of callback function. somehow call button event is not getting triggered. I am not able to find fault in code. can any one help me. this is code. http://pastebin.com/nhBrbg4s.
[01:23:18] <Clex> fosser_josh: try replacing $(".callvc").click(function (){ by $(document).on('click', '.callvc', function(){
[01:24:15] <fosser_josh> Clex: ahh that works. thanks.
[01:24:24] <fosser_josh> i was trying .live()
[01:24:33] <fosser_josh> but that was also not working
[01:25:05] <Cork> fosser_josh: live support is removed
[01:25:20] <fosser_josh> ohh okh
[01:25:26] <anli> Can I resize all text, even h1, h2 etc with one style (by percentage)?
[01:25:34] <anli> oh, its a #css question
[01:25:36] <anli> sorry
[01:25:47] <Cork> anli: depends on how you have specified the font-size on those elements
[01:26:01] <Cork> if they are relative (em, or rem) then yes yo can
[01:26:08] <xec_> he just left
[01:26:13] <xec_> aand hes back :)
[01:26:14] <anli> Sorry
[01:26:21] <seutje> you could do some nasty shit with $('*') and getComputedStyle or something, but it's more of a CSS thing
[01:26:27] <anli> Every time I /join #css, my xchat crashes
[01:26:32] <xec_> lol
[01:26:33] <anli> I forgot
[01:26:35] <anli> :)
[01:26:36] <seutje> must be webkit
[01:26:37] <xec_> out of self defense
[01:26:41] <anli> heh
[01:26:46] <anli> Must be a crappy irc client
[01:27:14] <xec_> 10:25 <Cork> anli: depends on how you have specified the font-size on those elements
[01:27:14] <xec_> 10:26 <Cork> if they are relative (em, or rem) then yes yo can
[01:27:37] <Cork> anli: i would recommend moving to a client that is still developed
[01:27:41] <Cork> ?g hexchat
[01:27:41] <b-ot> Cork: HexChat: Home â†’ http://hexchat.github.io/
[01:27:47] <Cork> xchat clone ^
[01:27:54] <sjuxax> Hello. What event should I listen to if I just want to change the values of an input field as soon as they're initialized on page load, and never again? Just do it directly at the end of document.ready() without listening for an event?
[01:28:00] <anli> I cannot upgrade xchat for windows, since this is the latest free version :)
[01:28:02] <sjuxax> I just want to make sure the values are populated before I use them.
[01:28:13] <Cork> anli: hexchat is free and supports all os:es
[01:28:20] <anli> And I do not use that, lol
[01:28:21] <Cork> and like i said, is still developed
[01:28:23] <anli> Is it good?
[01:28:35] <Cork> it is xchat + fixes and less bugs
[01:28:40] <anli> oh
[01:28:43] <anli> Maybe worth it
[01:28:47] <Cork> it is
[01:28:56] <anli> This is actually YChat, which is xchat with all those bugs
[01:31:30] <anli> Seems to be hard to apply a percentage on already styled font-sizes
[01:31:54] <anli> I tried by setting the parent to font-size: 90%, then .parent *: font-size: 90%, different results, not the expected ones
[01:32:00] <Cork> anli: like i said it depends on the style
[01:32:05] <Cork> if you have set the style with px then ya
[01:32:08] <Cork> you are out of luck
[01:32:10] <anli> I have
[01:32:15] <mehrdad> can somebody give a hint please?
[01:32:19] <Cork> so fix the styles ;P
[01:32:34] <anli> Oh, I dont want to adapt them, maybe I can just scale the page
[01:32:37] <mehrdad> ...regarding executing code after a certain jquery lib does its job
[01:32:51] <anli> Thats not a totally lousy idea actually
[01:32:58] <Cork> mehrdad: there is no generic way to do that
[01:33:08] <mehrdad> depends on the lib i know
[01:33:11] <seutje> mehrdad: the validation plugin doesn't seem to support adding a callback before the form is being submitted, you could duck punch it and execute ur stuff before the plugin runs
[01:33:14] <Cork> mehrdad: it all depends on how the lib works, and what interaction it provides
[01:33:17] <mehrdad> but the lib doesn't seem to provide such a hook
[01:34:05] <seutje> (function($){  var foo = $.fn.pluginName; $.fn.pluginName = function() { doMyShit(); $.fn.pluginName.call(arguments); } })(jQuery); ?
[01:34:11] <mehrdad> seutje:  i want to hook into it after it attaches to the form, not on form submit
[01:34:31] <seutje> swap the call/doMyShit?
[01:35:03] <mehrdad> hmm ...let me see how it goes
[01:35:06] <mehrdad> thanks
[01:41:34] <motaka2> using jquery ajax, I get reply in google chrome but I get parserror in firefox
[01:41:42] <motaka2> what is the problem ?
[01:41:52] <Cork> ...
[01:42:05] <Cork> how about shoing the code, request and error?

[01:46:29] <Cork> motaka2:  read what b-ot said

[01:48:57] <Cork> motaka2: the response you send back to your call?
[01:49:04] <Cork> the json you want to validate...
[01:49:39] <motaka2> there is no response but just an error, it actually always runs ajax::error function
[01:52:38] <sijmon2003> Hey guys, i have a problem with this calc script im working on, it is not calc right when you add a extra item (the small check boxes on the left (see images) here is the code http://paste.laravel.com/1dpH http://cl.ly/image/1G1U141V1W3a 15+15 should be 30 and not 179
[01:53:11] <Cork> sijmon2003: don't post images
[01:53:16] <Cork> code or demos
[01:53:17] <sijmon2003> sorry
[01:53:37] <Cork> images is just "oh, ok" "moving on"
[01:53:48] <sijmon2003> okay im sorry
[01:53:48] <Cork> there is little anyone can do with them
[01:54:01] <xec_> the second link is actually code ;)
[01:54:07] <xec_> err first
[01:54:16] <Cork> ugg
[01:54:24] <Cork> didn't even see them as two links >_>
[01:54:32] <sijmon2003> :D
[01:54:40] <seutje> sijmon2003: what's op_pris?
[01:54:46] <seutje> where does it come from?
[01:55:07] <sijmon2003> its "oprettelse" create price
[01:55:14] <seutje> medlemskab also seems to be coming from a higher scope
[01:55:16] <Cork> sijmon2003: your using a load of global variables
[01:55:22] <Cork> you might ant to define those
[01:55:29] <seutje> localized coads are hard :(
[01:55:42] <Cork> (actually all of the variables are global)
[01:55:48] <anli> Ok, sorry that I am asking a css question now, but my irc client craches when I /join #css, can I scale to have a width of 100% instead of -moz-transform: scale(0.8);
[01:55:56] <anli> crashes
[01:56:06] <sijmon2003> cork it was so i can each them all
[01:56:25] <Cork> sijmon2003:
[01:56:27] <Cork> what?
[01:56:28] <seutje> anli: scale to 1?
[01:56:38] <Cork> sijmon2003: you arn't declaring any of your variables
[01:56:39] <seutje> 1 is 100% of the actual size
[01:56:50] <anli> hm, scale to 1 should not scale, right?
[01:56:55] <Cork> sijmon2003: so you are basically doing window.sum =  and window.medlem = and so on
[01:57:11] <xec_> anli: you can't both scale and keep the width
[01:57:20] <Cork> so if any of these functions run across each other you will have bugs
[01:57:26] <anli> I dont want to keep the width, just make it 100% of the parent
[01:57:33] <seutje> anli: I'm confused, you can scale up and u can scale down, but scaling to 100% requires you to have scaled prior to scaling back
[01:57:38] <seutje> oh
[01:57:42] <anli> Sorry
[01:57:43] <anli> My fault
[01:57:43] <sijmon2003> oh
[01:57:46] <joroci> if i use addEventListener('keydown'... on an input it will not add the letters i type?
[01:57:50] <xec_> anli: if you want to up the font size, just increase the root font size (on body or whatever) and use relative font sizes as Cork suggested
[01:57:50] <Cork> sijmon2003: and that might actually be what your seeing
[01:57:53] <seutje> anli: width: 100%; ?
[01:58:07] <anli> Width of 100% will not achieve scaling
[01:58:10] <sijmon2003> Cork: so i just put a var VariableNavn = ...
[01:58:11] <seutje> don't transform, transforms don't affect the real size
[01:58:23] <Cork> sijmon2003: yes, first time you use it in the function
[01:58:28] <seutje> ooooh
[01:58:30] <Cork> not infront of each call
[01:58:42] <seutje> not sure u can do that with just CSS, since you need to know the scale factor
[01:58:44] <sijmon2003> okay i will try :) thanks Cork
[01:58:47] <anli> Maybe I should calculate the percentage and set the transform live
[01:58:53] <seutje> 1.2 might be 100% the parent
[01:58:56] <seutje> 1 might be
[01:59:35] <seutje> you could set its width to be an explicit 50% of the parent and then scale up to 2
[01:59:52] <sijmon2003> Cork:  then i just get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[02:00:00] <Cork> code
[02:00:10] <Cork> preferably jsfiddle.net
[02:00:34] <anli> heh
[02:07:38] <intellix> anyone know how to suppress an iframe redirect to TOP. I see it's possible with HTML5 allow-top-navigation to be turned off... but is it possible without that? tried onbeforeunload but that throws up a dialog box. I want to completely stop an iframe from navigating away from my site
[02:09:31] <intellix> I can't find one thing on google -.-
[02:14:24] <sijmon2003> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/6WPmp/ i cant get the jquery to work :S
[02:15:24] <Cork> sijmon2003: http://jsfiddle.net/6WPmp/1/
[02:16:09] <sijmon2003> Cork:  hm damn there is too much php etc. so it dosent work on jsfiddle
[02:16:38] <sijmon2003> but thanks for the help Cork
[02:16:49] <Cork> sijmon2003: i didn't mean you had to add more code then you used first
[02:16:55] <Cork> jsfiddle is just easier to edit
[02:17:25] <sijmon2003> Cork: oh okay, i was thinking you would see it in action :)
[02:17:42] <Cork> well that would have been even better :)
[02:17:44] <Cork> but not a must
[02:18:14] <sijmon2003> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/GFWBK/
[02:18:24] <sijmon2003> in the calculateSum i have but var
[02:20:05] <Cork> sijmon2003: http://jsfiddle.net/GFWBK/1/
[02:20:32] <Cork> sijmon2003: also make sure the values are parsed correctly
[02:20:42] <Cork> parseFloat doens't handle commas as decimals
[02:21:12] <sijmon2003> should i use parseInt
[02:21:32] <Cork> you would have to do .replace(',', '.')
[02:21:42] <Cork> as js expects dot as decimal
[02:22:31] <sijmon2003> okay :)
[02:22:55] <Cork> other then that you would have to debug what values you get out of the selectors
[02:23:00] <Cork> can't guess at them
[02:25:03] <sijmon2003> but the problem is that if i select a membership and add some extra products its fine, but when i change the date to 26-12-2013 the (discount) comes in and it still calc right, but if i then change membership or add/remove a extra product, it calc wrong, it seems like its not changing the DOM price
[02:25:18] <sijmon2003> and it still remember what the price was before the discount comes in
[02:26:05] <Cork> sijmon2003: make sure you fix all the global variables
[02:26:21] <Cork> from the earlier fiddle i saw a lot more of those
[02:27:05] <ThoMe> hiho
[02:27:22] <ThoMe> how i can change a href text inside from a td with class "jobsDeviceForm" ?
[02:27:26] <ThoMe>  $('#' + printerName).children('td.printerNameRow').('.jobsDeviceForm').text('bla');
[02:27:29] <ThoMe> doesnt works.
[02:27:50] <ThoMe> can anyone help me please?
[02:28:14] <hecatonicosachor> .() is a syntax error
[02:28:22] <hecatonicosachor> what were you trying to do?
[02:28:38] <Cork> ThoMe: not sure what selection relation you want to create
[02:28:58] <Cork> $('#' + printerName).find('.jobsDeviceForm').text('bla'); ?
[02:29:18] <Cork> or is there a specific row you want to target?
[02:29:42] <ThoMe> Cork: specific row.
[02:29:53] <ThoMe> $('#' + printerName).children('td.printerNameRow'). and then a aref class.
[02:29:56] <ThoMe> is find better, yes?
[02:30:01] <Cork> $('#' + printerName).find(',orubterNaneRow .jobsDeviceForm').text('bla'); then
[02:30:08] <ThoMe> like $('#' + printerName).children('td.printerNameRow').find('a').text('bla'); ?
[02:30:14] <Cork> ThoMe: what is '#' + printerName ?
[02:30:19] <Cork> the table?
[02:31:07] <ThoMe> Cork: jep.
[02:31:16] <Cork> then children won't ever work
[02:31:25] <ThoMe> Cork: http://paste.keks.be/454
[02:31:30] <Cork> as the only possible children of table is thead, tbody and tfoot
[02:31:38] <ThoMe> line 340.
[02:32:24] <Cork> ThoMe: tables is always <table><tbody><tr>
[02:32:36] <Cork> if you don't add tbody in html it will be created for you automatically
[02:32:47] <ThoMe> Cork: $('#' + printerName).children('td.printerNameRow').find('.jobsDeviceForm').text('bla'); works fine
[02:32:50] <Cork> so in js you always have table > tbody
[02:33:04] <ThoMe> is find the best solution?
[02:33:05] <Cork> ThoMe: shouldn't
[02:33:19] <Cork> well $('#' + printerName).children('td.printerNameRow') should always be nothing
[02:33:28] <Cork> oh
[02:33:28] <Cork> wait
[02:33:34] <Cork> no you mean $('#' + printerName) is a tr
[02:33:45] <ThoMe> sorry, yes. table row. :-)
[02:34:03] <ThoMe> $('#' + printerName).children('td.printerNameRow').find('.jobsDeviceForm').text('bla'); i need find?
[02:34:18] <Cork> $('#' + printerName).find('.jobsDeviceForm').text() should be all you need
[02:34:37] <Cork> and yes it is quicker to just jump to a instead of going down then children list
[02:34:42] <ThoMe> Cork: is find performence mild? :-)
[02:35:06] <Cork> ThoMe: well it is faster then several .children() with a selector
[02:35:13] <Cork> as you just build the result once
[02:35:24] <Cork> and it uses native browser code for the search
[02:35:31] <Cork> so yes that is fast
[02:38:00] <fabioportieri> uuh.. any reason why chrome dev tools source panel won't show *all* my js sources?
[02:38:26] <Cork> fabioportieri: dynamic js normally don't show in those tools
[02:38:46] <fabioportieri> it's include in a .js file tho
[02:38:53] <ThoMe> Cork: thank you very much.
[02:39:31] <Cork> fabioportieri: js don't have include
[02:39:50] <Cork> if you get include client side that is a lib doing; and yes that is dynamic js
[02:40:26] <fabioportieri> i have this <h:outputScript name="js/amcharts/pieSetup.js"/>  and it's shown, but i also have this <h:outputScript name="js/widgetsWrapper.js"/>  but is not shown
[02:40:58] <Cork> h:
[02:41:03] <Cork> what server language?
[02:41:05] <fabioportieri> <h:etc is a wrapper for <script></script>
[02:41:12] <fabioportieri> jsf for java
[02:41:22] <Cork> fabioportieri: check the generated html
[02:42:39] <fabioportieri> cork <script src="/Fondip-UI/javax.faces.resource/js/widgetsWrapper.js.jsf?v=3_3_0_130416" type="text/javascript"></script>
[02:42:51] <fabioportieri> and <script src="/Fondip-UI/javax.faces.resource/js/amcharts/pieSetup.js.jsf?v=3_3_0_130416" type="text/javascript"></script>
[02:42:58] <fabioportieri> they look identical to me
[02:43:11] <Cork> fabioportieri: check in the net tab so the files is actually requested and 200 returned
[02:43:21] <anli> I am trying div.css('-moz-transform', 'scale(0.5)'); cant I set that style with script?
[02:43:36] <fabioportieri> Cork: yes 200 ok for both
[02:43:40] <Cork> anli: you can
[02:43:46] <anli> ok
[02:43:55] <Cork> anli: you might need to use MozTransform though
[02:44:10] <Cork> anli: also mozillas newer browsers doesn't support -moz-transform
[02:44:11] <fabioportieri> Cork: well nevermind, since i can make it shown by clicking on it in the elements tab...
[02:44:15] <fabioportieri> thanks
[02:44:19] <anli> Mine does
[02:44:27] <anli> At least with I set it with script
[02:44:39] <anli> How can a style be called MozTransform, thats so unstandard
[02:45:11] <Cork> anli: the prefix was removed in ff16
[02:45:17] <anli> ok
[02:45:40] <Cork> anli: no it is the standard
[02:45:42] <anli> So it should really be 'transform' then
[02:46:00] <Cork> anli: jquery adds translation from css properties to js properties
[02:46:16] <Cork> js converts -<char> to <UpChar>
[02:46:34] <Cork> so -webkit-transform becomes WebkitTransform
[02:46:38] <anli> Are we talking about div.prop('MozTransform', foobar); then?
[02:46:40] <Cork> same for OTransform (opera)
[02:46:41] <Cork> and so on
[02:46:44] <Cork> no
[02:46:52] <Cork> elm.style.<properties
[02:46:55] <Cork> what .css changes
[02:46:57] <anli> ok
[02:47:17] <anli> div.css('MozTransform', 'scale(0.5)'); had no effect
[02:47:27] <Cork> ya, cause the prefix is removed
[02:47:34] <anli> ok
[02:47:41] <Cork> if you want to use prefix in js
[02:47:47] <Cork> you need to sniff what prefix is used
[02:47:59] <Cork> or just move it into css and use classes
[02:48:15] <anli> I need to change that transform gradually
[02:48:34] <Cork> then you need to sniff the value
[02:48:40] <Cork> *property
[02:48:53] <anli> Testing
[02:49:37] <anli> firebug reads transform: scale(0.5);
[02:50:09] <Cork> though you need to use the prefix for webkit
[02:50:15] <Cork> its still prefixed there
[02:50:25] <anli> ok
[02:50:37] <anli> Thanks Cork
[03:11:01] <fabioportieri> today it's escaping hell
[03:19:21] <fabioportieri> i could use some help here :/ http://pastie.org/8544345
[03:19:41] <fabioportieri> tried to make it as a testcase in jsfiddle, wasn't able to reproduce it since it works as it should
[03:20:32] <Cork> fabioportieri: why are you using : in your id's
[03:20:35] <Cork> you asking for pain
[03:20:44] <fabioportieri> Cork: the framework generates them that way.. i know..
[03:20:49] <Cork> lovely...
[03:20:57] <Cork> i don't think you can use sizzle on that
[03:21:33] <Cork> try doing somehting like $(document.getElementById('gapForm:arrowUp')
[03:21:39] <Cork> * $(document.getElementById('gapForm:arrowUp'))
[03:22:04] <Cork> but right... your using delegate >_<
[03:22:18] <fabioportieri> yes
[03:22:29] <Cork> fabioportieri: you might have to use a regular event handler and do the delegation your self
[03:22:38] <fabioportieri> Cork: why so?
[03:22:56] <Cork> cause i don't think you can get : through sizzle (the selector helper behind jquery)
[03:23:00] <fabioportieri> as long as i don't parametrize the id it works fine
[03:23:10] <Cork> it will take arrowUp as a function call
[03:23:18] <fabioportieri> ahh
[03:23:43] <fabioportieri> even if i escape the colon?
[03:24:04] <Cork> you could try with "#gapForm\\\\:arrowUp"
[03:24:11] <Cork> but i don't think it will work
[03:24:39] <Cork> fabioportieri: note those two line in the pb isn't the same
[03:24:47] <Cork> the first one results in a string with \:
[03:24:52] <Cork> the second ends with \\:
[03:24:59] <fabioportieri> pb?
[03:25:04] <Cork> pastebin
[03:25:07] <fabioportieri> ah
[03:25:16] <fabioportieri> ahh
[03:25:23] <fabioportieri> as i said, escaping hell..
[03:25:24] <Cork> var arrowUpId = $j(arrowUp).attr("id").replace(":","\\:"); would be the same as the first one
[03:25:39] <Cork> ya, you just should never use []: or . in id's
[03:25:42] <fabioportieri> i tried that
[03:25:45] <Cork> # is another nono
[03:25:58] <fabioportieri> but it result in gapForm\:arrowUp
[03:26:05] <Cork> that is expected
[03:26:10] <Cork> that is what you want
[03:26:20] <fabioportieri> mm it didn't work that way iirc
[03:26:25] <Cork> "\\" generates the string => \
[03:26:31] <fabioportieri> yes
[03:26:31] <Cork> "\\:" generates the string => \:
[03:26:46] <fabioportieri> but this works: $j("body").on("mousedown","#gapForm\\:arrowUp", function(e) {
[03:26:47] <Cork> and if you want to escape : for sizzle you want to send it \:
[03:26:59] <fabioportieri> so what i wanted is to reproduce that
[03:27:04] <Cork> ya cause "" takes \\  and converts it to }
[03:27:06] <Cork> *\
[03:27:06] <fabioportieri> and i came up with \\\\:
[03:27:08] <Cork> no
[03:27:13] <Cork> read what i just said
[03:27:28] <fabioportieri> \\: ?
[03:27:54] <Cork> "#gapForm\\:arrowUp" would be the same thing as .replace(":","\\:");
[03:27:59] <Cork> not .replace(":","\\\\:");
[03:28:05] <fabioportieri> ok, let me try again
[03:28:46] <fabioportieri> ok so that worked
[03:28:58] <fabioportieri> but i changed it because i have another issue, but no jquery errors
[03:29:01] <fabioportieri> mmm
[03:29:08] <fabioportieri> thanks Cork
[03:30:12] <anli> If I use scale to have a div being stretched to 100%, I need to set the height separately, right?
[03:30:20] <fabioportieri> there is still something wrong somewhere
[03:30:42] <Cork> fabioportieri: could you generate an example for this?
[03:30:48] <Cork> a working fiddle
[03:31:12] <fabioportieri> ahh Cork nvm it works ok now
[03:31:22] <fabioportieri> (forgot to fix the mouseup/mouseleave)
[03:31:38] <fabioportieri> <Cork> # is another nono
[03:31:47] <fabioportieri> what do you mean?
[03:32:03] <Cork> <elm id="soemthing#as#id"></elm>
[03:32:14] <fabioportieri> ah no i don't have that fortunately
[03:32:30] <fabioportieri> i just use a string to buffer an id, so i do "#"+string in my selector
[03:32:43] <BinaryKitten> buffer an id?
[03:32:43] <Cork> fabioportieri: ya, i just listed bad characters
[03:33:22] <fabioportieri> BinaryKitten: yes the idea is the user call the plugin providing an idname and i use internally something like that
[03:34:14] <fabioportieri> aniway jsf output the worst markup i have ever seen
[03:34:53] <BinaryKitten> fabioportieri store the element in a var as well
[03:35:20] <fabioportieri> yes i have it cached
[03:35:54] <fabioportieri> again, thanks for the help
[03:47:31] <kamuela> How would I use jQuery to load a JSON value from an http location into a local script variable?
[03:48:12] <xec> kamuela: is the http location the same domain as the website is hosted on?
[03:48:52] <kamuela> xec: no, it's a public access json-formatted url
[03:49:23] <sijdesign> Cork: can you help me with this problem, it say "Uncaught ReferenceError: start_date is not defined " and thats right, but i do a if(isset... on the calculateSum function http://jsfiddle.net/aFGYt/
[03:49:32] <kamuela> i was gonna try it with just plain javascript, but then i realized that there's a reason people use jquery lol
[03:49:38] <sijdesign> Cork:  i want to check if start_date is set and is over 26
[03:49:39] <anli> Strange, when I transform a page by scaling, one float goes below another even if they were side by side before
[03:50:37] <xec> kamuela: does the external site support jsonp?
[03:51:25] <Cork> sijdesign: you might need to parse the string
[03:51:38] <sijdesign> parseFloat
[03:52:56] <xec> kamuela: if not, you're probably better off making the request from your server-side code. because of security concerns you can't (normally) make cross-domain ajax requests
[03:53:18] <kamuela> xec: i'm not sure i quite understand what that is from the wikipedia page. that seems like a way to incorporate not json data, but code. these have public api's so i'm pretty sure they're accessible. for example, directly pointing the browser to the URL dumps JSON data
[03:54:16] <kamuela> xec: how do facebook like buttons and things like that get around a restriction such as that?
[03:54:43] <xec> kamuela: different tactics, but most use something like an iframe
[03:55:14] <xec> kamuela: google for terms like "same origin policy" to see why the restriction exists
[03:55:38] <kamuela> xec: so from within a page's <script> tag, i can't access json data from another domain that provides a public API?
[03:55:51] <xec> kamuela: correct
[03:56:44] <kamuela> xec: so this is a limitation specifically to on-page javascript rendered in the browser?
[03:56:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> sec: hey
[03:56:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> *xec: hey
[03:57:15] <kamuela> xec: that's a little disappointing. i was hoping i could make a widget that compared to external api's data
[03:58:12] <xec> kamuela: jsonp uses a method that inserts a <script> on your page to fetch a remote script that executes a function you create
[03:59:08] <kamuela> xec: but this script would have to be supplied by the API writer on that API's domain?
[03:59:25] <xec> yes
[03:59:52] <xec> but it is a widely adopted method, so if the api is meant for web widgets you may be in luck
[04:01:38] <xec> if not, you'd have to find another workaround, such as using iframe to include (part of) the widget (and hosting your script on a site and doing the http request on your server)
[04:02:01] <xec> Rohan_Bhangui: hello
[04:02:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> how goes it
[04:02:17] <xec> can't complain
[04:02:26] <opalepatrick> Having difficulty with magnific.js as per http://jsfiddle.net/UTK8H/ - I get a 'Uncaught TypeError: Property 'getInline' of object [object Object] is not a function ' in chrome
[04:02:53] <opalepatrick> just popping inline content
[04:03:05] <opalepatrick> any help appreciated
[04:03:56] <kamuela> xec: hmm so jsonp is you on the client side creating a function that executes injected json data as an argument from the remote server?
[04:05:18] <xec> kamuela: basically, yes.  you don't really have to worry about the implementation details, with jquery you can just set the type to "jsonp" and it does the rest for you (assuming the external api supports jsonp of course)
[04:06:20] <kamuela> xec: is the method in jquery similar to trying to start a car without knowing if it has gas? :) stupidly complicated way to ask whether i could try to method and see if the API responded favorably
[04:07:03] <xec> kamuela: hehe, well sure, just go ahead and see if it works
[04:08:09] <kamuela> xec: where can i find a demo?
[04:09:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: lol for the past week I have spent hunting down a #jquery user
[04:09:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> fine times
[04:09:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> *fun
[04:11:17] <xec> Rohan_Bhangui: what? sounds interesting, whats the story?
[04:11:39] <xec> `api ajax @ kamuela
[04:11:39] <b-ot> kamuela: No matches.
[04:11:43] <xec> meh
[04:11:58] <xec> kamuela: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:12:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api $.ajax @kamuela
[04:12:04] <b-ot> kamuela: No matches.
[04:12:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api Jquery.ajax @kamuela
[04:12:12] <b-ot> kamuela: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:12:18] <kamuela> jeez, i thought that said "No bitches" and felt a little small
[04:12:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: ^ your welcome
[04:13:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: the guy owes me cash for a job, I need to buy gifts for family and the guy hasnt paid me. He is on his honeymoon which is oddly convenient, the more days that go by I smell more and more of a scam
[04:13:52] <seba4> hi to all i got one question. How in javascript or jquery i can set code like this   something =  true;     !something == false;   so something can easily become false
[04:13:52] <kamuela> xec: so basically a standard ajax call with jquery will know how to use jsonp inline?
[04:14:10] <seba4> true becomes false and false becomes true
[04:14:28] <xec> kamuela: yes, just set the correct datatype, search for "jsonp" on the docs
[04:15:00] <kamuela> something = true; theflip = !something; something = !something;
[04:15:07] <xec> seba4: something = !something; ?
[04:15:33] <seba4> tried with it but it didnt work need to see if i have done sometthing wrong
[04:15:57] <xec> Rohan_Bhangui: did you get paid eventually?
[04:16:00] <JackBauer24> seba4: you can also do something = something ? false : true;
[04:16:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: im still hunting him
[04:16:10] <xec> Rohan_Bhangui: this is why I doin't freelance btw :(
[04:16:23] <xec> don't*
[04:16:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: the reason why I havent ruled out the fact that he hasnt gotten time is cause I give people benefit of the doubt
[04:17:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: not all freelancing is bad, just use a simple rule: half  is advanced to you, half on delivery
[04:17:57] <xec> the other reason i don't freelance is that i have a steady paid-by-the hour job ;)
[04:18:21] <JackBauer24> Rohan_Bhangui: or make backdoors unless it wasn't for online usage
[04:19:05] <kamuela> hmm quick question, html5 is it <script src="etc" /> or <script sr...></script> or <script sr...>
[04:19:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> SecretAgent: lol
[04:19:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> not you SecretAgent
[04:19:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: lol
[04:19:54] <xec> kamuela: in html5 just <script src="url"></script>
[04:19:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> JackBauer24: it is bound for online, the issue is its a a good amount of cash for me to not let it go
[04:23:16] <opalepatrick>  I get a 'Uncaught TypeError: Property 'getInline' of object [object Object] is not a function ' in chrome when doing http://jsfiddle.net/UTK8H/ (popping inline content)
[04:27:12] <kamuela> xec: do you work specifically using js?
[04:29:16] <ali4ever4> can i get your oppenion or experiance on Augmented reality related Jquery plugins what you have used and what is cool and realiable ?!
[04:31:13] <fabioportieri> what's augmented reality?
[04:33:24] <Xionbox> fabioportieri: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality
[04:33:33] <xec> kamuela: hm?
[04:33:44] <xec> kamuela: as in, what my dayjob is?
[04:33:50] <kamuela> yep
[04:34:08] <ali4ever4> fabioportieri: augmented reality ! is providing virtual reality experiance to site visitor by adding virtual elements to the actual reality he is in, by capturing that through users webcam using something like webRTC
[04:34:12] <Xionbox> ali4ever4: I don't have much experience with AR, but I'm quite skeptical as to using jQuery for that, or any web development too for that matter.
[04:34:14] <xec> it's front-end for internal webapps, so basically css, html and js
[04:34:37] <fabioportieri> i see thanks
[04:34:55] <Xionbox> ali4ever4: so you would like to design a website which is integrated with the user's surrounding? Website specific?
[04:34:56] <xec> kamuela: of course, i often end up doing a fair amount of server code too, and we use C# and mssql
[04:35:09] <fabioportieri> google earth is an augmented reality app then?
[04:35:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> kamuela: any good frontend person knows their backend too
[04:35:29] <fabioportieri> or google maps
[04:36:11] <kamuela> xec: awesome. i've been playing with js for just a few days now and there's something... mad hacky about it, i just love it
[04:36:25] <xec> fabioportieri: not really, imagine you're holding up the phone, aiming some direction, and on screen you see what the camera is capturing, alongside information of what you're pointing at
[04:36:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> kamuela: it is truly great. I fell in love with web programming because of it
[04:36:48] <xec> kamuela: what's your background?
[04:37:11] <ali4ever4> Xionbox: thanks for replay  well its for a one day interactive show and we need the audionce to interact with our imagenry 3d models through their phones , since the show is going to happen within 3 weeks we don't have time to develop for android and IOS and even if we did that IOS app will not get approved within the day of the show so our only hope now is HTML5
[04:37:20] <xec> kamuela: it's definitely different from most OOP for sure
[04:37:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: well xec js can be oop
[04:37:53] <kamuela> xec: all over the place. i've never programmed professionally except to help gain real-world js experience in the last few days
[04:38:04] <xec> Rohan_Bhangui: of course, just differently ;)
[04:38:23] <kamuela> xec: when i was a kid i did perl, c++ etc, took a java class in high school, came back about 2 months ago and played with django, then rails
[04:38:55] <kamuela> xec: i've been doing meteor and js for about a week
[04:39:14] <Xionbox> ali4ever4: okay. How do you plan on doing image analysis in the browser to detect your placeholders?
[04:39:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> kamuela: damn....youve been moving everywhere bro. kamuela may I suggest your next conquest after meteor?
[04:39:51] <xec> kamuela: i see what you mean by all over the place :D
[04:40:31] <kamuela> lol nah but extremely hobbyist with all of them. i wouldn't say i'm very good at anything :P
[04:41:07] <ali4ever4> Xionbox: i was hopping to get some choices from this channel :p but i have found one which is js-objectdetect and it has a jquery plugin https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect i was hopping to get other options here or may be someone who experianced using this lib or other
[04:41:54] <xec> kamuela: in programming, perceived self esteem is usually inversely proportional to skill
[04:42:15] <xec> kamuela: or something along those lines, i forget what it was :P
[04:42:37] <kamuela> xec: haha, i wish i followed that. but i break the mold i promise
[04:42:51] <kamuela> i truly just want to be able to build web apps
[04:42:58] <kamuela> that's been the great push back to coding
[04:43:08] <Xionbox> ali4ever4: oh cool, I didn't know that was possible. Sorry I can't really help you though. I've used augmented reality apps in the past but never designed one myself.
[04:43:12] <Xionbox> Best of luck!
[04:47:15] <ali4ever4> Xionbox: Thanks a lot , and yes i think i need lots of luck to get this thing running :p
[04:47:27] <kamuela> xec: btw, i found http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ but i think i'm failing miserably right now. i think my issue is trying to store the data
[04:47:43] <ElysiumNet> it appears I have a minor issue with $().width(). In the same browser, it returns different values for when the tab with the page is active and another value for if the tab with the page is not visible
[04:47:58] <xec> kamuela: getJSON isn't going to work cross site
[04:48:40] <xec> oh wait, yes it will, if you supply the callback in the url
[04:48:59] <ali4ever4> fabioportieri: this link will explain more about Augmented REality  and give example as well also it is a lib in jquery for doing such things https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect
[04:49:11] <ElysiumNet> I've tried $(document).ready() and $(window).load() but neither help me get the correct number
[04:49:11] <kamuela> xec: but a callback in the url is pretty much going to mean the server needs to provide that functionality
[04:49:19] <xec> kamuela: correct
[04:49:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> kamuela: you should try phoengap next
[04:49:22] <xec> :D
[04:50:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: im assuming you have heard of phonegap?
[04:50:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> xec: have you tried steroids js then?
[04:50:47] <xec> http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2521843
[04:50:52] <fabioportieri> thanks ali4ever4
[04:50:56] <ElysiumNet> nevermind, it be fixed now
[04:50:56] <xec> funniest news i've seen in a while
[04:51:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> bro i know i have been seeing all the vids
[04:51:12] <kamuela> Rohan_Bhangui: hey, just looked at phonegap. pretty cool man thanks. :)
[04:51:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> how he pulled it off I will never know
[04:51:33] <fabioportieri> that's some cool stuff
[04:51:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> kamuela: okay then, this will blow your mind: http://www.appgyver.com/steroids/
[04:52:13] <kamuela> no worries, it was obama talking. he was translating correctly.
[04:52:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[04:56:51] <fabioportieri> this augmented reality stuff is supposed to work with webgl or other 3d stuff?
[04:57:39] <ali4ever4> Rohan_bhangui :  kamuela:  there is http://www.applicationcraft.com/ you should really try it, it really make things simpler and give lots of native app features that are not easy to get in webapps
[04:58:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> ali4ever4: just 1 tincy wincy problem: its paid
[04:59:30] <ali4ever4> fabioportieri: if you are asking about this specific lib i am not sure yet need to play with it to findout  i really don't have time to get into webGL and do super things i am hoping with this lib i will be albe to overlay my model images into the camera stream or something handling webRTC
[05:00:47] <ali4ever4> Rohan_Bhangui: true , but its not that expensive ( i am saying that cause one of my friends did few apps with it and the amount he pays is nothing compared to the amount  he is getting back from the appstore and play store )
[05:00:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you up?
[05:01:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> ali4ever4: i dont create apps for myself, I do it for clients, and the amountI get from them is worth alot more
[05:01:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> ali4ever4: ugh....ill check it out it looks interesting
[05:02:04] <kamuela> ali4ever4: i'm a little bit confused with how it's accomplishing all this?
[05:02:16] <ali4ever4> Rohan_bhangui : thats even better  :)
[05:02:30] <kamuela> ali4ever4: is it using  its own client library and nodejs or something?
[05:02:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> kamuela: basically all hybrid apps use a native wrapper
[05:02:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> in the end
[05:04:39] <ali4ever4> kamuela: well they do have their own code some native libs for android and native libs for ios and they have they lib in js that can communicate to those native libs and their functions in that way they provide access to most of natively available features others do the same but good thing about application craft is they are teaming up with powerful service providers for such things like push notification or inapp ads and others
[05:06:02] <kamuela> ali4ever4: wow, coca-cola in the testimonials
[05:07:14] <ali4ever4> have to leave now , bye
[05:08:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> ye
[05:08:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> bye
[05:09:51] <anli> I will move a logo from a div A to another div, I need to have the same background, can I seek the parent chain of A to get a background color?
[05:11:42] <kamuela> i gotta sleep. maybe i'll figure out this json thing when i'm up. thanks for all the help everyone, xec, Rohan_Bhangui
[05:11:48] <kamuela> night
[05:12:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> np
[05:19:20] <fabioportieri> anli: parent()
[05:30:51] <sijdesign> if i need to check a age is between 16 and 25 how can i do that ?
[05:31:07] <sijdesign> (age >= 16 || age <= 25)
[05:31:12] <sijdesign> i have that
[05:31:32] <daveaway> age >= && age <= 25
[05:31:37] <daveaway> er 16
[05:31:41] <daveaway> age >= 16 && age <= 25
[05:32:21] <sijdesign> or so it should be &&
[05:32:26] <daveaway> && = and, || or.. or would mean if the vlaue is over 16 do this, or if th evalue is under 25 do this
[05:32:59] <sijdesign> Thanks :D
[05:33:01] <daveaway> and that basically means all values pass the test, if you use &&, the value has to be over 16 AND under 25
[05:33:02] <daveaway> np
[05:33:19] <sijdesign> hehe yes thats right :D
[05:34:25] <sijdesign> hm i need to calculate half price, how can i do that :D
[05:41:15] <greengriminal> I have the following fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Md3ns/ this is checking the contents of what being inputted which is either html or css. But i want to evaluate whether js is also being entered also.
[05:41:28] <greengriminal> I am effectively trying to devise something very similar to jsfiddle.
[05:42:11] <greengriminal> To be precise I was following this tutorial: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/how-to-inject-custom-html-and-css-into-an-iframe/ but he only evaluates html & css can you also evaluate JS?
[05:43:56] <seutje> greengriminal: sure u can, using pretty much the same technique, but if the iframe was entirely crafted, you can run the parent frame's stuff in there as well
[05:45:23] <seutje> greengriminal: basically, if you still have a reference to the iframe around, as say "foo", you can just use foo.window.bar() to call the bar function in the iframe's global scope
[05:45:45] <seutje> alternatively you can set stuff on that window object, just like it was the regular window object (sorta kinda)
[05:46:08] <seutje> or wait, it's like foo.contentWindow.bar I think
[05:48:37] <xec> greengriminal: you can't live update a script tag the same way you're doing there
[05:49:14] <xec> greengriminal: but if you only want to inject a script once, it should be fine
[05:49:24] <greengriminal> I was and am really trying to implement something very similar to plnkr
[05:49:51] <greengriminal> and from my understanding Plnkr uses Ace Editor which I can probably achieve what I want.
[05:50:18] <greengriminal> xec: Yes that is right I want to inject the script once
[05:50:35] <greengriminal> seutje: Thank you for the information.
[05:54:30] <xec> greengriminal: http://jsfiddle.net/Md3ns/1/
[05:54:57] <xec> greengriminal: of course, i imagine this is wide open to attacks
[05:55:27] <greengriminal> xec: Agreed but I am just playing around with it for now
[05:55:33] <greengriminal> Much appreciated :)
[05:55:46] <xec> greengriminal: also note that you can't have the string "</script>" appear in your code, because that would end the script right there
[05:56:50] <DevAntoine> hi
[05:56:54] <greengriminal> Ah right
[05:57:49] <DevAntoine> are we ok with the fact that the following selector: $('tr a:not(".voir_infobulle")', '.liste_dossiers') will fire on every link inside a tr inside an element having the class "liste_dossiers" except when the link as the class "voir_infobulle"?
[05:58:43] <sijdesign> hm i need to calculate half price, how can i do that :D
[05:59:43] <xec> DevAntoine: nope
[06:00:25] <xec> DevAntoine: what you explained would be more like $('tr a.liste_dossiers:not(".voir_infobulle")')
[06:00:25] <DevAntoine> xec ?
[06:01:01] <xec> DevAntoine: or maybe $('.liste_dossiers tr a:not(".voir_infobulle")')
[06:01:32] <DevAntoine> well, that's the same if I put .liste_dossier as a second parameter for the scope no?
[06:01:41] <xec> oh dear, yes, you're right
[06:01:51] <xec> but i'd recommend you don't use that
[06:01:54] <xec> :D
[06:02:08] <DevAntoine> way more readable imo
[06:02:24] <DevAntoine> well, anyway my not selector is not working
[06:02:50] <xec> ah, the irony
[06:03:06] <DevAntoine> and I really don't know why
[06:03:15] <xec> could you make a demo?
[06:04:55] <Denommus> in jquery dialog, there is a "modal" option, which promises that background elements will be disabled while the dialog is open
[06:05:01] <Denommus> well, the option is not working
[06:05:33] <Cork> xec: there isn't meant to be any strings in the :not selector
[06:06:14] <Cork> i'm actually surprised that works
[06:06:25] <rethus> i have defined <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script> before the closing body-tag.
[06:06:40] <rethus> and i have use
[06:06:42] <rethus> $(document).ready(function(){
[06:06:43] <rethus> 			$('#nav-sub').hide();
[06:06:44] <DevAntoine> xec: it works in jsfiddle, god damn
[06:06:45] <rethus> 		});
[06:06:47] <xec> Cork: maybe that's why it doesn't!
[06:06:54] <rethus> ups, sorry, schould come a pastebin
[06:06:54] <xec> oh nevermind
[06:07:04] <Cork> rethus: ready depends on jquery getting added before body is parsed
[06:07:20] <rethus> but the firefox say, $ is not defined
[06:07:21] <Cork> rethus: so you can't use ready if you add jquery at the end
[06:07:38] <Cork> ya, cause you need to wait for jquery to be loaded
[06:07:47] <Cork> as it is asyncronically loaded
[06:07:56] <xec> wat
[06:08:02] <rethus> how can i solve this, have i always to add the script-tag in the header?
[06:08:06] <Denommus> $(selector).dialog("option", "modal") shows me true, so the option is correctly setted. Why aren't the background elements disabled, then?
[06:08:07] <Cork> xec: script tags at the end of body
[06:08:16] <Cork> rethus: move jquery.js to the head
[06:08:23] <Cork> the rest can be at the end of body
[06:08:33] <xec> Cork: is loaded synchronously, as every other tag..?
[06:08:44] <Cork> xec: only if it is in head
[06:08:55] <xec> wat
[06:09:00] <Cork> the parser will actually pause until it is parsed and executed
[06:09:06] <Cork> sorry
[06:09:10] <Cork> fetched, parsed and executed
[06:09:19] <xec> the only way to make scripts load asynchronously is with <script async>, yes?
[06:09:24] <Cork> no
[06:09:33] <Cork> if you put it in body it loads async too
[06:09:38] <xec> wat
[06:09:53] <Cork> that is why ppl say to put it at the end of body
[06:10:07] <xec> no, that is to load *after content*
[06:10:10] <xec> not async
[06:10:27] <Cork> xec: if they would load sync, body wouldn't close until the script has been fetched and parsed
[06:10:29] <DevAntoine> xec: I've found it's the following snipper which makes my selector fail, but I don't know why: http://pastebin.com/RTtLSETs
[06:10:29] <DevAntoine> (yes that's ugly)
[06:10:31] <Cork> and you would gain nothing
[06:10:57] <rethus> xec, thanks
[06:11:14] <xec> Cork: the browser renders all the html it encounters, so if your script tag is in the middle of the page you'd see half the page before the script is downloaded
[06:11:30] <xec> Cork: doesn't matter if the </body> is encountered yet or not
[06:11:53] <Cork> your sure?
[06:12:07] <xec> Cork: pretty sure, yes
[06:12:09] <Cork> i've seen things to say difference
[06:12:16] <Cork> *different
[06:12:43] <xec> Cork: im even more sure that three script tags at the end of body will run in the order they are in the code
[06:12:50] <xec> Cork: i.e. synchronously
[06:12:58] <Cork> though i have to admit i block most scripts now days so i don't see much of this either way
[06:13:31] <fabioportieri> today i can't even manage to make an if () right
[06:14:41] <Cork> xec: hmm looks like your right...
[06:14:50] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/2dPf7/
[06:15:36] <Cork> though i know ie has real problems with .ready at the bottom of body
[06:16:45] <xec> DevAntoine: i don't know what part of that fails, or why, but that first line is redundant
[06:17:18] <xec> DevAntoine: if you call .click() on an empty collection you will simply not bind to anything, which is better than running the selector twice
[06:17:20] <Cork> DevAntoine: make sure those selectors match
[06:17:48] <javalover> hey guys i have a really annoying bug
[06:18:01] <javalover> what I want to do is when you drag & drop an object, it clones itself
[06:18:04] <xec> DevAntoine: what does the html look like?
[06:18:17] <javalover> and it is cloning but then when I drag again, it's dragging the original object...not the clone
[06:18:38] <javalover> i'll fiddle lol
[06:20:01] <Denommus> it was a z-index problem
[06:24:16] <DevAntoine> does a classic selector (jquery 1.6) works when an element is not displayed by default?
[06:24:40] <Cork> if by display you mean display: none; then yes
[06:24:55] <Cork> if doesn't work if the element isn't in the dom
[06:26:04] <DevAntoine> Cork: the element is in the dom with display: none
[06:26:12] <Cork> then it should work
[06:26:14] <DevAntoine> ok, so it's not coming from there
[06:26:19] <DevAntoine> I can chan :not selectors right?
[06:26:43] <Cork> it often fails to chain them
[06:27:01] <Cork> the :not selector is quite limited
[06:27:36] <Cork> if you find you need to use a lot of :not selectors it might be time to restructure your classes
[06:30:50] <DevAntoine> Cork: thanks, that's what I've done
[06:31:35] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/q7eTN/
[06:31:38] <javalover> ok I finally set it up
[06:31:54] <javalover> now what happens is that you drag the element into a new folder
[06:32:09] <javalover> and I want it to copy that element & move it but keep the old element in the original folder
[06:32:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> ehhhhh its javalover
[06:32:31] <javalover> hi Rohan
[06:32:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> whats up
[06:32:42] <javalover> trying to fix this bug
[06:32:54] <javalover> it's copying but then....when you move the old  one it moves the copy
[06:33:06] <javalover> or vice versa, something is just wrong
[06:33:22] <javalover> I am using copy(true) so it is keeping the draggable functionality
[06:33:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: i would access the event and check what the target is
[06:33:42] <javalover> good idea 1 sec
[06:33:50] <javalover> in fact imma do it on the fiddle :-)
[06:34:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: just console.log the event
[06:34:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> check the context and target
[06:34:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: also you have a bug when i drag the rtf to same folder it creates antoher
[06:35:36] <javalover> I want it to do that
[06:35:45] <javalover> well not same folder lol but
[06:35:50] <javalover> I want it to clone
[06:35:55] <javalover> 1 step at a time lol
[06:36:08] <javalover> i want it to be a cloned copy is my goal
[06:36:15] <javalover> and then I move the clone to the new folder
[06:36:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: okay, what is the event saying?
[06:36:35] <javalover> well since the event is on the folder
[06:36:39] <javalover> it just lists the folder but imma check ui
[06:37:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya sure, the event will actually give you alot of info, thats why when I am offline and im programming and something doesnt work I check the event
[06:37:52] <furry_monkey> Hi all, I'm having a little trouble with a (very small) jquery plugin which allows me to replace checkboxes with my own icon. I've asked a question on StackOverFlow but no one has so far been able to help me. If any of you gurus fancied taking a look I'd be very grateful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20496054/jquery-custom-checkbox-not-updating-as-expected
[06:38:50] <javalover> hmm
[06:39:01] <javalover> yeah checking ui just gives same ui each time for any object
[06:39:14] <javalover> and event just lists the folder...
[06:39:37] <javalover> lets help furry monkey
[06:39:40] <javalover> as mine will take some time
[06:40:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: target the parent of the clicked checkbox and set all checkboxes to unchecked
[06:40:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: already on it, although I dont see why furry_monkey cant write the checkbox stuff from scratch
[06:40:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> which would give him more control
[06:40:55] <javalover> some people don't even know they can do such a thing :-)
[06:40:56] <daveaway> you can use CSS to do your own check boxes:/
[06:41:33] <daveaway> http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/css3-checkbox-radio/
[06:42:26] <furry_monkey> Rohan_bhangui: thanks for helping (and javalover too) I'm a bit of a noob with jquery and javascript and I've just found this plugin which I understand is inefficient but I've stared at the code so long it'd be nice to just understand how to get it to do what I want
[06:43:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> daveaway: lol I actually was working on custom checkboxes and radio buttons with grafi a few days ago
[06:43:04] <furry_monkey> how can I target the parent of the clicked checkbox and set all checkboxes to unchecked?
[06:43:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> daveaway: http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[06:43:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^part of a front end framework im working on
[06:43:50] <daveaway> i never thought i'd say this
[06:43:53] <daveaway> but.. nice check boxes LOl
[06:43:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:43:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[06:44:02] <javalover> so I thought about this carefully
[06:44:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: you can add event to the checkboxes
[06:44:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> so basically
[06:44:15] <javalover> I drop it, it leaves the old clone there right ontop of the folder
[06:44:34] <javalover> but then for the object itself it just resets
[06:44:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> $("input[type='checkbox']").on("click,.......
[06:44:39] <javalover> if I don't clone however, that never happens
[06:44:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then use $(this).parent()
[06:44:50] <javalover> which means, on the drop, when that is completed...it must reset somehow
[06:45:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: ????
[06:45:16] <javalover> here i'll give you an example
[06:45:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[06:45:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i thought we were helping furry_monkey
[06:45:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: ^
[06:45:40] <furry_monkey> :)
[06:46:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: its actually really easy to creat your own cehckboxes and radio buttons yourself
[06:46:06] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/S5v4c/4/
[06:46:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have images of your checkbox states?
[06:46:15] <furry_monkey> yup
[06:46:20] <javalover> little bit of both
[06:46:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: same as what i saw before
[06:46:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> it duplicates
[06:46:31] <javalover> yes but notice when you drop it
[06:46:34] <javalover> where it duplicates
[06:46:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[06:46:43] <javalover> so i clone it in the state of it being dropped
[06:46:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: you check the event?
[06:46:54] <javalover> don't have to I already see it
[06:47:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> bro
[06:47:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> i mean
[06:47:09] <javalover> so it clones it in it's state
[06:47:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> console.log(event)
[06:47:26] <javalover> yeah sure but that's same cuz the event is targetting the folder
[06:47:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> did you check the target and context
[06:47:30] <javalover> not the item being dropped
[06:47:30] <anli> Will parent() sooner or later be null?
[06:47:36] <javalover> yeah it's same always folder
[06:48:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmmm
[06:48:06] <javalover> so heres the thing
[06:48:16] <javalover> if I don't clone it, if I don't do anything but sitll cause the drop
[06:48:27] <javalover> it will delete the clone & reset
[06:48:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: mind linkingme to your cehckboxes (i want to see if they can be done via css only)
[06:48:41] <javalover> theres 2 clones...1 for the object dragged & 1 for the one i'm making
[06:48:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[06:48:55] <javalover> so considering it resets, I never reset the one I clone
[06:48:59] <javalover> and idk how it resets....
[06:49:12] <javalover> so if I can just do that part I think it'll fix it
[06:50:09] <javalover> refreshPositions: true,
[06:50:09] <javalover>   revert: "invalid",
[06:50:09] <javalover>   revertDuration: 300,
[06:50:14] <furry_monkey> rohan_bhangui http://renegadeox.com/img/checkbox.png - I appreciate you helping me
[06:50:20] <javalover> srry for triple post but...that part is what reverts it
[06:50:44] <javalover> so i'm just not reverting the clone & it thinks it's where the other one is...
[06:50:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: you can do those using css only (no images required)
[06:51:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: understand I am not a master at jquery, frankly I find build my own ui is much more rewarding, ill help as I can
[06:51:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> *not a master at jquery ui that is
[06:51:48] <javalover> well it's just...somewhere it reverts, so maybe if I just revert manually it will work
[06:52:01] <javalover> even just talking about it helps
[06:52:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: maybe, you understand why I am askign you to cehck event right?
[06:52:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> *check
[06:52:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey:
[06:52:28] <javalover> yeah but I did that, that's how I found this out to begin with realizing the steps it's taking
[06:52:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: i did custom radio and checkbox butons here --
[06:52:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[06:53:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: repo is here --> https://github.com/rohanbhangui/frontend <---take a look at the css and html and youll probably be able to figure out how I idd them
[06:54:02] <furry_monkey> Thanks Rohan_Bhangui I'll take a look. I take it it wouldn't be a simple matter to fix the code as I have it now?
[06:54:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: not so. It's just that my repo doesnt use js, doesnt use a plugin and only uses html and css
[06:54:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: you want to avoid using js if css will suffice
[06:55:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: hmmmm im mystified why its not working
[06:55:21] <javalover> i can tell you this, it's not positioining
[06:55:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: how about trying to figure out how to manually clone?
[06:55:38] <furry_monkey> thanks for the advice. I think I need to spend a little more time figuring out the css way then.
[06:55:40] <javalover> the event that's firing, trigures the ui to attach tot he oroginal element
[06:56:03] <javalover> unless
[06:56:06] <lasha> omfg guys
[06:56:07] <javalover> the event itself has an id
[06:56:12] <javalover> maybe that's it
[06:56:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> furry_monkey: ya I used to do that too: run to js when something seemed too difficult in css but trust css is so much cleaner
[06:56:41] * Rohan_Bhangui smells a eureka moment
[06:56:41] <lasha> i tried building a time selector yesterday
[06:56:50] <b0ss_> Hi, I want to accomplish the same behavior than in here http://www.electrictoolbox.com/jquery-toggle-select-on-change-1/ but without writing in code ALL selects. I wanna to write only the real needed second select. How do I do it ?
[06:56:56] <lasha> hours, minutes, am/pm
[06:57:03] <lasha> each with up/down arrows
[06:57:13] <lasha> i did 98% of it
[06:57:19] <lasha> last bit destroyed me
[06:57:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> b0ss_: rephrase please
[06:57:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you mean by "without writing in code ALL selects"
[06:57:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: fiddle?
[06:58:14] <lasha> getting a link for you
[06:58:34] <javalover> that has to be it
[06:58:44] <javalover> i'm making a copy, but the event trigger is attached to old id
[06:58:46] <anli> Is there a selector for the existence of a certain style?
[06:58:55] <javalover> is there a way to change the event trigger id?
[06:59:40] <fosser_josh> hi guys, i wanted to know is there are any compatibility problem with jquery UI and ipad. as i was creating dialog box. when i click button and dialog box appear it completely fill the screen ipad screen in zoom mode. but actual size of dialog box is small.
[06:59:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: what you mean
[06:59:58] <b0ss_> Rohan_Bhangui: I mean if you noticed, #exampleBanana, #exampleApple and #exampleOrange are all present in the code. Thus I'd like to add to HTML ony the needed select, as picked in the first one.
[07:00:13] <anli> Rohan_Bhangui: I want to find the closest parent that has the style background set
[07:00:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: http://api.jquery.com/closest/ ?
[07:00:47] <javalover> hmm i'll figure this out don't trip
[07:01:03] <anli> Rohan_Bhangui: I asked for the selector, I have used closest a lot of times
[07:02:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> b0ss_: why would you add only the needed selects (and if you wnat to do that you probably want to append the content )
[07:02:44] <javalover> Rohan I found this http://jsfiddle.net/Robodude/Y7RmR/
[07:02:48] <b0ss_> for the second selects are just too big and the code would become ilegible
[07:02:54] <javalover> so his is working...i'll just figure out how & use that instead
[07:03:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: sure, and when your done, there are quite a few people asking for help here so
[07:04:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> well b0ss_ to be honest I would just code it into html and then display: none it. And when you need one fo the second selects show it
[07:04:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> doing it with append will bie messy
[07:04:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: thinking
[07:05:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: so let me get this straight
[07:05:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> you want to check which parent / grandparent has background value?
[07:05:42] <lasha> Rohan_Bhangui: i'm having my friend forward the jsiddle to me, hang on. it's super heavy logic-based javascript. very easy to get confused, but you seem solid :D
[07:05:59] <anli> I want to know which is the prefered color for a certain logo, in other words, on which background is it currently displayed on?
[07:06:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: Ill try to keep up :P
[07:06:31] <anli> I am creating a clone of the logo that should be placed in an equally colored div
[07:07:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: cant seem to find a way to do it with selector, I would just use .closest
[07:07:22] <anli> closest what then
[07:08:07] <JenniferB2> Hi folks! Is there an element that one can use to input random text in? That is not HTML compatible. I tried using the <script type="mytype">adasd..sdas.ds</script>  ... but IE seems to be complaining about this ... any idea?
[07:08:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: well what I would do is use a loop of somekind and keep checking parents until you find the on with the particular property your looking for
[07:08:41] <anli> Yes
[07:08:46] <anli> Or a selector
[07:09:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> :) still going about the selector ehh?
[07:09:05] <anli> Why not
[07:09:09] <anli> If there is one, that will say
[07:09:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill think
[07:09:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: but your best bet is the loop
[07:09:45] <anli> I tried actually
[07:09:54] <anli> Did not work out for some reason, trying to make a fiddle of it
[07:10:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure ill have a look
[07:10:23] <anli> :)
[07:10:31] <anli> Hm, xchat was nice btw
[07:10:39] <anli> Can /join #css now without crashing my irc client
[07:10:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol anli did I help you with that?
[07:11:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> your welcome i gues
[07:11:01] <anli> nope :)
[07:11:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> *guess
[07:11:03] <xec> lol anli
[07:11:04] <anli> heh
[07:11:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?? did I miss something :P
[07:11:31] <anli> No, I got help from, must think, Cork
[07:11:40] <Feloower> Hello buddies
[07:11:43] <xec> yeah but it was hexchat, no?
[07:11:58] <anli> I used YChat
[07:12:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> hello Feloower
[07:12:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: I use chatzilla myself
[07:12:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> standalone
[07:12:31] <anli> oh
[07:12:33] <Feloower> I need to pass data with $("#selector").fancybox();
[07:12:47] <Feloower> how can I pass data to url
[07:12:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> but I still havent figured out how to get hexchat custom theme
[07:13:03] <anli> Seems to not be worth it
[07:13:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> cant find theme manager
[07:13:17] <anli> If there is a way to set a background image, I will maybe be in for it
[07:13:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol anli stick with hexchat, chatzilla has its own issues
[07:14:44] <anli> I think the zilla suffix scares me anyway :)
[07:14:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you switch aero mode off and then on it goes black completely
[07:14:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: lol
[07:14:58] <anli> Well, filezilla is actually the ftp client of my choice
[07:15:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: could agree more
[07:15:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> *couldnt
[07:15:20] <anli> :9
[07:15:21] <anli> :)
[07:15:25] <Cork> anli: filezilla has NOTHING to do with mozilla though :)
[07:15:30] <Cork> it is a common mistake
[07:15:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: it is indeed
[07:16:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually interestingly enough chatzilla is not apart of firefox its ore apart of seamonkey
[07:16:05] <Cork> not from them, dosen't use any of there libs or platform or anything
[07:16:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> what chatzilla or filezilla?
[07:16:38] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: eh, it is an extention actually
[07:16:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[07:16:48] <Cork> the first line was about filezilla
[07:17:00] <Cork> it builds on the xulrunner platform if you run it standalone
[07:17:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> the cool thing is seamonkey and firefox are powered by mozilla
[07:17:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: thats how im running chatzillla right now
[07:17:31] <Cork> the almost killed platform
[07:18:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya seamonkey is gone man, looks terrible
[07:18:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.seamonkey-project.org/doc/img-screen/mac/browser.png
[07:18:20] <Cork> well xul is almost gone
[07:18:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> really?
[07:18:36] <Cork> ya
[07:18:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> why
[07:18:45] <Cork> they are slowly moving to pure html
[07:18:58] <Cork> cause most of what xul can do is supported in html now days
[07:19:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[07:19:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> sow hat will happen to chatzilla standalone?
[07:19:34] <Cork> will prob have to depend on the browser
[07:19:42] <Cork> or make a full compile
[07:19:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i hope they make full compile
[07:20:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: so how did you change theme in hexchat?
[07:20:35] <anli> There are some .htc files to download
[07:20:42] <anli> Then I dont know more, tried to drag one
[07:20:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know
[07:20:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> how did you run those
[07:20:52] <anli> Optimistic, I gather
[07:21:04] <anli> You can open them and manually input the values ;)
[07:21:13] <anli> In a text editor
[07:21:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: http://hexchat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/appearance.html
[07:21:55] <anli> I cant even get the syntax right here, why is the on_find_color_clicked fucntion not defined? http://jsfiddle.net/MCC9L/2/
[07:22:39] <anli> Ah, missing paren
[07:23:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: how did you get themes to work
[07:23:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> i still cnat
[07:23:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> *cant
[07:23:54] <anli> I did not, I gave them up
[07:24:00] <anli> Cant be worth it
[07:24:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: I figured it out
[07:24:57] <MalMen> there is anyway to cancel all $.getJSON requests ?
[07:24:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> .hct files are zip files
[07:25:04] <anli> oh, hct
[07:25:19] <anli> Wonder why you just cant drag them
[07:25:25] <lasha> Rohan_Bhangui: it's coming!
[07:25:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: im not going anyhwere
[07:25:56] <rohanbhangui> anli: hey
[07:26:01] <anli> I am trying to find the background color of a divs parent chain, however, I cant even find out which line that makes the script hang: http://jsfiddle.net/MCC9L/3/
[07:26:35] <Aquaword> hi
[07:26:51] <lasha> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/derpjelly/Lvefm/16/
[07:26:59] <Aquaword> if I have an object with key, value pairs, why obj.length gives undefined?
[07:27:04] <lasha> Rohan_Bhangui: i don't have time this second to explain
[07:27:16] <lasha> Rohan_Bhangui: do you have 30-45 mins?
[07:27:18] <Aquaword> logging obj gives the whole object in consol
[07:27:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> yeah
[07:27:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: msg me a little later than
[07:27:43] <shoky> anli: you're taking #start's background
[07:27:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli: so you need to find .foo element
[07:28:04] <anli> And foo is the parent
[07:28:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhhh shoky is here
[07:29:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> day is saved
[07:29:30] <MalMen> there is any method to cancel every ajax request on jquery ?
[07:30:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> MalMen: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446594/abort-ajax-requests-using-jquery
[07:30:12] <anli> MalMen: Cant you just set a boolean that every success handler can read?
[07:31:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: how you been man
[07:31:44] <MalMen> rohanbhangui yes, i already read that, that kind of work, but theres a simple way, of cancel everything ?
[07:31:58] <MalMen> without have to set variables to every request now on my script
[07:32:49] <rohanbhangui> MalMen, read the answer and the last line
[07:32:51] <rohanbhangui> about arrays

[08:07:17] <woolva> Hi guys, found you via google. can anyone help, im wondering on using a script on wikia to pull stats of a website, from battlelog.
[08:07:49] <daveaway> hang around a bit though, you may not get an answer straight away
[08:08:01] <daveaway> alot of people ask a question then run off after about 30secs
[08:08:47] <woolva> Lol, Thanks, sure ill hang around. I have found a site that has the API to pull it, but to transfer it to wikia, i have no clue.
[08:23:41] <lasha> rohanbhangui?
[08:23:42] <rohanbhangui> javalover, still going at it?
[08:23:51] <rohanbhangui> lasha, welcome back
[08:23:55] <lasha> hi
[08:23:58] <lasha> so....
[08:24:04] <lasha> the problem with the code
[08:24:05] <rohanbhangui> give me the link again
[08:24:07] <rohanbhangui> I lost it
[08:24:18] <lasha> if you hit up/down arrows on the hours
[08:24:25] <lasha> http://jsfiddle.net/derpjelly/Lvefm/16/
[08:24:49] <lasha> you can get it to a state where the numbers on the bottom range from an AM number to a PM number
[08:24:56] <lasha> or vise versa
[08:25:44] <airdem> how do i run a function that i have declared within a variable?
[08:26:02] <lasha> and THEN if you click the top/bottom arrow to swap AM/PM, to "from hour" format (am/pm) breaks
[08:26:11] <airdem> tried window.function; didnt work
[08:26:17] <rohanbhangui> lasha i think I see your issue
[08:26:22] <rohanbhangui> let me guess
[08:26:39] <rohanbhangui> the last range doesnt switch to pm
[08:26:59] <rohanbhangui> for exmaple
[08:27:04] <rohanbhangui> if you use 2:45pm
[08:27:12] <rohanbhangui> it shows 10:00am to 2:00am
[08:27:52] <rohanbhangui> no nvm
[08:27:53] <lasha> oh the minutes weren't programmed yet
[08:27:57] <lasha> those aren't the prboelm
[08:27:58] <lasha> it's the hours
[08:28:40] <airdem> ah ok i can do that with window['filter']; but how can i pass params to filter function?
[08:28:45] <rohanbhangui> so basically you want a range for the last one
[08:29:03] <lasha> i have the to and from ranges outputted, yes?
[08:29:10] <lasha> basically, the numbers are always fine
[08:29:19] <airdem> lol window['filter'](event); :)
[08:29:19] <lasha> but when i swap am/pm
[08:29:26] <lasha> the AM/PM of the
[08:29:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: so basically you have a range for the last one
[08:29:36] <lasha> toHour breaks
[08:29:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> which shows a range +- 2 3 hours
[08:30:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> i mean -3 hours
[08:30:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> 4 hours
[08:31:14] <lasha> -4. yes
[08:31:17] <lasha> so basically
[08:31:24] <lasha> whatever hour the user is at
[08:31:36] <lasha> it's FLIP hour to get the reverse format
[08:31:44] <lasha> and then subtract 4hr
[08:31:57] <lasha> so if 2pm is flipped to 2am
[08:32:01] <lasha> and 2am - 4hrs
[08:32:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> ohhh okay
[08:32:10] <lasha> your range is 10pm to 2am
[08:32:15] <aldodelgado> Question? I'm trying to create a list of items on the left and then I'd like the user to select one of the items and match it to another item from a list. Once all the items have been selected the user would then make a post. Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?
[08:32:17] <lasha> make sense
[08:32:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> somewhat
[08:33:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: when you send code it is a good idea to comment just fyi
[08:33:25] <lasha> this was done in an emergency
[08:33:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> oaky
[08:33:29] <lasha> sorry dude
[08:33:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: np
[08:33:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: when I press the am/pm button
[08:33:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> my time is set to 7:00
[08:34:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> when i swithc am/pm
[08:34:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> the 3:00am doesnt change
[08:34:20] <lasha> make sure you only flip the am/pm AFTER changing the hour at least once
[08:34:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya thats what i did
[08:34:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> the am part gets screwed up
[08:35:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> for the hour to
[08:35:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> hour from i mean
[08:35:14] <lasha> right exactly
[08:35:23] <lasha> so "from" hr is what needs to get reprocessed
[08:35:30] <lasha> based on the toHour
[08:35:38] <lasha> and toHour's format
[08:35:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[08:35:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> so then just switch it
[08:35:58] <lasha> the toHour switches fine
[08:36:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[08:36:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> switch the fronthour
[08:36:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> fromhour
[08:37:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: it doesnt seem to proceed beyond line 3
[08:37:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> *37
[08:38:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: ?
[08:39:19] <lasha> one sec
[08:39:46] <lasha> every conditional is utilized at some point
[08:39:48] <lasha> for sure
[08:39:52] <lasha> i tsted it last night
[08:39:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> not after line 37
[08:39:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> it never gets triggered
[08:40:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> other wise my console would read 3
[08:40:41] <lasha> click up hour many times
[08:40:47] <lasha> let it lap a few times
[08:40:53] <lasha> you'll see 3
[08:43:34] <inv3nt0r> Hi everyone... I'm workign on
[08:43:52] <inv3nt0r> I'm working with the Google Maps API, and wondering if there is an easy way (with jQuery) to click a pushpin marker
[08:44:07] <inv3nt0r> something like jQuery(marker1).click();
[08:44:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: i see
[08:44:28] <inv3nt0r> I've set my markers as global variables but can't seem to make it work...
[08:45:01] <inv3nt0r> The page in question is: http://ks.athiel.ca/about-us/locations/   and the tabs below the map have my jQuery click function
[08:49:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: got some time
[08:54:41] <grafi> nope fresh off to player soccer
[08:54:44] <grafi> cya
[08:56:49] <lasha> so, Rohan_Bhangui all i need is to be able to reprocess the "from hour" after the am/pm flips
[08:57:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: here is the logic
[08:57:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> basically everytime you switch the am/pm
[08:57:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> the fromhour should change as well
[08:58:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> to be precise it should be exact opposite of the selected am/pm
[08:58:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> except
[08:58:34] <lasha> except if the fromHour is before 12 o'clock
[08:58:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> for when the time is 4am i think
[08:59:10] <lasha> 4am or 4pm is the hour where the "fromhour" switches
[08:59:26] <lasha> from am to pm accordingly

[09:16:27] <airdem> is there a way to store the css styles of an element and apply them later on again?
[09:16:51] <lasha> yes
[09:17:09] <airdem> without tons of code or plugins? :P
[09:17:12] <lasha> var myStyle = $(".selector").css("property");
[09:17:28] <lasha> which stores the value of property
[09:17:30] <lasha> and then you do
[09:17:38] <airdem> i would like to store all styles that apply to a specific element
[09:17:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: store in array them
[09:17:49] <lasha> $(".selector").css("property", myStyle);
[09:18:18] <toss> Rohan_Bhangui thanks
[09:18:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> np
[09:18:50] <airdem> was hoping .css() would give me all styles corresponding to the element

[09:20:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> pawanspace: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2008592/can-i-find-events-bound-on-an-element-with-jquery <-- that what your looking for
[09:21:40] <airdem> Rohan_Bhangui, thank you
[09:21:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> np
[09:25:00] <airdem> hmmm
[09:25:37] <airdem> the problem is i have an element that gets its style because it is located inside a div. i would like to glue those styles to the element because i am moving it somewhere else.
[09:25:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> lasha: i suggest when you rework your stuff that you also get rid of the up and down and use '<' and '>' instead
[09:26:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> inline-block should do
[09:26:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: hmmmmmm...i would assume that function would store them in an arrary that you can access later
[09:27:24] <airdem> well i tried the function from stackoverflow. just did element.css(css(element)); before moving
[09:27:24] <lasha> Rohan_Bhangui: that was does as per the eventual design of the thing
[09:27:40] <airdem> didnt worked :P
[09:28:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> airdem: cause it doesnt story them alteast I dont think so
[09:28:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> youll have to store them in an array
[09:28:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is defined in the global scope
[09:28:48] <airdem> wont this  element.css(css(element)); apply the style that are inherited directly to the element?
[09:29:39] <airdem> thought it wont matter if i move the element somewhere else after i applied the style directly to it
[09:31:12] <airdem> anyway, im looking into it. thanks for now

[09:41:08] <Aristata> Hello, I am having a problem with jQuery autocomplete. My javascript looks like this: http://pastie.org/private/mc4tittwjuuxtxwg9uog . For some reason, when I select a result from the autocomplete, my server shows that an ajax request is being made to whatever page is hosting the autocomplete. Does anyone know why this autocomplete is loading the page over and over in the background everytime the user selects something?
[09:52:14] <wasim> $(".kkcount-down").kkcountdown({ 			dayText		: ':', 			daysText 	: ':', 			hoursText	: ':', 			minutesText	: ':', 			secondsText	: '', 			displayZeroDays : true, 			addClass	: '' 		});
[09:52:44] <wasim> now how to load it using live function in jquery, i am using older jquery version with live support
[09:52:52] <wasim> i have a counter plugin,
[09:55:31] <wasim> how to load $(".kkcount-down").kkcountdown({}); to work on dynamic content (loaded with ajax) as well. Using live is not working here.
[09:59:23] <airdem> how can i create a pseudo event object?
[10:00:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> wasim: dont paste code in irc

[10:06:59] <wasim> my question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20526684/jquery-plugin-load-external-function-with-live
[10:13:47] <djangonoob> how can I send a ajax request which returns a image with mimetype=jpeg and on success load image into an <img>?
[10:20:44] <djangonoob> how can load an image into <img> on ajax success which returns image with mimetype=jpeg ?
[10:27:05] <NoiseEee> djangonoob: ideally, the xkr/ajax should be returning a path to the image not the image itself in most cases.  are you sure you want to return the actual image?
[10:27:50] <djangonoob> I dont save the image because it is a "live stream"
[10:30:43] <NoiseEee> djangonoob: well maybe check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3721764/handling-images-from-xmlhttprequest-with-html-and-javascript or similar googlin
[10:32:43] <BillCriswell> I need a nap.
[10:33:30] <djangonoob> NoiseEee, thx, I've forgotten this possibility

[10:33:58] <slax0r> and I need a break
[10:34:01] <slax0r> give me a kitkat
[10:35:37] <BillCriswell> I don't break off the pieces of kitkat bars like normal people. I just chomp into them to bother people around me.
[10:35:57] <BillCriswell> "You can't eat those like that." "Shut up"
[10:37:46] <shoky> i eat the bars one by one, but without breaking them off first :(
[10:38:32] <slax0r> I don't unwrap it even, ain't nobody got time fo dat
[10:38:59] <shoky> +1 for edible wrappers
[10:52:35] <BillCriswell> I chomp in. Across 3 bars if I'm lucky.

[11:20:47] <jm092> Is there a way to add a callback to val() -- or somehow ensure that another function only runs after the val() is successful? http://jsfiddle.net/dbGk2/8/
[11:31:46] <greengriminal> I have the following fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/U5JtP/14/. Which I have constructed with two resources. 1) http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/how-to-inject-custom-html-and-css-into-an-iframe/ which is how i create my css & html into an iframe and 2) http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about
[11:32:17] <greengriminal> What I am trying to achieve is use the ace editor but with the same similar logic of being able to insert html and css but using ace editor.
[11:32:51] <greengriminal> So that instead of these ugly looking boxes I can have ace-editor take in html & css and bind it to my output box. It most probably is a trivial thing I am asking here.

[11:50:05] <Belsazar> hi
[11:53:00] <Belsazar> is it normal that my jquery ui tab widget in body is on the whole page (100%) horizontally and not content based?
[12:10:58] <joroci> if i use addEventListener('keydown'... on an input it will not add the letters i type?

[14:27:56] <quimbarreiros> hi, does anyone know if is possible to re-write a jquery function custom module?
[14:28:12] <Velveeta> sure
[14:28:13] <quimbarreiros> without messing with the original script?
[14:28:20] <quimbarreiros> Velvetta how can I do that?
[14:28:29] <quimbarreiros> sorry, Velveeta
[14:28:38] <quimbarreiros> sorry, *Velveeta
[14:28:38] <Velveeta> define: without messing with the original script
[14:29:01] <quimbarreiros> can you explain?
[14:29:02] <Velveeta> you mean without physically editing the text file that contains the original right?
[14:29:09] <quimbarreiros> give an basic example?
[14:29:16] <Velveeta> i'm asking a question
[14:29:18] <quimbarreiros> yes, Velveeta
[14:29:20] <Velveeta> ok
[14:29:26] <Velveeta> so what module are you wanting to rewrite?
[14:29:48] <quimbarreiros> that way in case there's a new version of the file, my re-write will still work :P
[14:29:49] <Velveeta> let's say you wanted to rewrite the css() function, which lives at $.fn.css, you'd just do $.fn.css = function () { some new function here }
[14:29:51] <quimbarreiros> that's the idea
[14:30:13] <zapsoda> I cant get jquery to pickup on this form being submitted and then prevent the submit, This is a test but what im acctully trying to do is make a ajax request when somone submits the form, The ajax request is already in a function which i tested through the console but when I try to submit the form it just goes to the action. The action is meant to be a no JS fallback. Any tips?
[14:30:50] <Velveeta> zapsoda: have you bound up a submit listener to your form yet?
[14:30:59] <Velveeta> to preventDefault() on the submit event?
[14:31:06] <zapsoda> http://jsfiddle.net/XfeRz/1/
[14:31:10] <zapsoda> Sorry forgot to include the link :P
[14:31:34] <zapsoda> Ive tried using Jquerys event listener and the onSubmit method, I would prefer onSubmit
[14:31:34] <quimbarreiros> Velveeta: http://piratepad.net/if6Bj3yYKN
[14:32:26] <zapsoda> I would prefer the onSubmit method so i can pass which form is submit as a paramater to the ajax function. I can do with a event listener and then just get the class name and use that instead for the form name.
[14:33:13] <zapsoda> brb
[14:33:21] <Velveeta> zapsoda: you don't need to use the onSubmit attribute for that
[14:33:37] <Velveeta> you can just call your ajax function and pass (this) to it, which will be the form in question
[14:34:34] <Velveeta> quimbarreiros: remove the test: function () {} from that
[14:34:53] <quimbarreiros> you can edit the piratepad
[14:35:10] <Velveeta> that looks correct now
[14:38:58] <quimbarreiros> Velveeta: just another simple question, in case of a "whatever plugin" to re-write the function example, would it be that way?
[14:39:03] <quimbarreiros> http://piratepad.net/if6Bj3yYKN
[14:39:56] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[14:40:37] <Toerkeium> I'm doing a double datepicker which selects the date range from "depart" to "return" but I have some problems I can't understand. This is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/87MdY/
[14:40:40] <Toerkeium> can you give me a hand?
[14:41:06] <Toerkeium> it should update datepicker1 when you select a date on datepicker2
[14:41:21] <Toerkeium> datepicker1 == #ddepart
[14:43:19] <zapsoda> Thanks Velveeta, But the form is still going to the action url http://jsfiddle.net/XfeRz/5/
[14:43:34] <zapsoda> And i cant even get a button click event to trigger the alert
[14:43:36] <Toerkeium> I'm refreshing on #ddepart when you click on a date on #dreturn, but #ddepart is no refreshing at all
[14:45:17] <Velveeta> zapsoda: you have errors in your javascript, that's why
[14:46:02] <Rout> If someone can help me, http://pastebin.com/tPUCCMP8 , the two first functions works... but the ajax function, dont write de html in the div
[14:46:19] <Velveeta> zapsoda: http://jsfiddle.net/XfeRz/8/
[14:46:31] <Toerkeium> fixed, thanks anyway
[14:47:40] <Rout> Velveeta: can u take a look, on my code?
[14:47:46] <Velveeta> zapsoda: and here's an example with an actual ajax function: http://jsfiddle.net/XfeRz/9/
[14:48:36] <Velveeta> zapsoda: er rather, this one without the syntax error: http://jsfiddle.net/XfeRz/10/
[14:48:40] <Velveeta> rout: sure
[14:49:15] <Velveeta> rout: 'this' isn't what you think it is in the context of that ajax function
[14:49:47] <Velveeta> you can force it to be by wrapping your success function in a $.proxy call: success: $.proxy(function (result) { }, this)
[14:50:26] <Rout> i'm noob with js, can u help me?
[14:51:23] <Velveeta> i thought i just did? :D
[14:52:43] <Velveeta> rout: here you go: http://pastebin.com/i0DhNWNj
[14:53:09] <Velveeta> and on that note, i gotta take off so i can get on the road before traffic gets crazy
[14:54:27] <Rout> Velveeta: a fast question
[14:54:31] <Rout> u still here?
[14:54:37] <Velveeta> fast as fast can be
[14:54:54] <Rout> how in JS i can get a value of a hidden input?
[14:55:05] <Rout> inside the div that i will update on ajax
[14:55:25] <duch_kazatel> Rout like you do with any other input.
[14:55:39] <duch_kazatel> Rout it beind hidden is a display property, not anything else.
[14:55:41] <Velveeta> you'll have to reference it with a selector just like all the other selectors you're doing, and then do something like $('#yourDiv input[type="hidden"]').val()
[14:55:41] <Rout> <div>             <div 1 > Button to uptade </div 1> </div 2>  input value </div 2>
[14:55:51] <Velveeta> and now i gotta get out
[14:55:53] <Rout> ok
[14:55:53] <Rout> thx
[14:55:56] <duch_kazatel> rout that markup is invalid btw.
[14:56:01] <duch_kazatel> <dv 1> is not valid.
[14:56:15] <Rout> i know
[14:56:16] <Rout> its just to...
[14:56:17] <duch_kazatel> ok
[14:56:19] <Rout> simplify
[15:20:18] <greengriminal> Anyone here?
[15:26:07] <Rout> its possible, in JQUERY, select all ids that contain X words?
[15:27:53] <grafi> x words?
[15:29:00] <daveaway> yeah
[15:29:10] <daveaway> you mean like.. all words that being with abc
[15:29:16] <daveaway> but end in anything
[15:30:00] <daveaway> $("[id^=blah]")  all words beginning with blah.. or $("[id&=blah]") all words ending in blah
[15:30:06] <daveaway> Rout
[15:30:14] <grafi> isnt end $= ?
[15:30:15] <daveaway> er & * $
[15:30:26] <daveaway> yes
[15:30:32] <grafi> very regexy
[15:30:54] <daveaway> found myself using it alot when i foudn out tags shouldn't be pure numbers :[
[15:31:01] <daveaway> er id's shouldn't be
[15:33:01] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[15:33:12] <Starcraftmazter> im trying to make a jquery function which is applied to an element with a selector
[15:33:34] <Starcraftmazter> but if i use $(this).attr('class') to get its classname, i get all its classnames
[15:33:42] <Starcraftmazter> how do i get only the only that it was attached to?
[15:33:49] <Starcraftmazter> sort of this thing: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4709822/add-jquery-function-to-specific-elements
[15:37:10] <Starcraftmazter> g-g-g--g-gguys?
[15:37:34] <shoky> Starcraftmazter: not sure what you're asking..
[15:40:07] <Starcraftmazter> shoky: say you make a function called addTimer()
[15:40:18] <Starcraftmazter> and you do $('.elementclass').addTimer()
[15:40:25] <Starcraftmazter> inside addTimer() how do you get elementclass
[15:40:42] <Starcraftmazter> and only elementclass - not all the other classes that element has
[15:41:49] <shoky> this.selector
[15:42:04] <shoky> $.fn.addTimer = function() { console.log(this.selector); }
[15:42:25] <shoky> actually that's been deprecated and removed, i see
[15:42:32] <grafi> :P
[15:42:37] <Starcraftmazter> well what do you do now
[15:42:54] <shoky> you're not supposed to be relying on the selector passed to $(...)
[15:43:24] <shoky> what exactly are you trying to do?
[15:43:32] <Starcraftmazter> why not
[15:43:33] <Starcraftmazter> :S
[15:43:40] <Starcraftmazter> im fixing up a timer
[15:43:51] <shoky> because it's not expected of the API
[15:43:52] <Starcraftmazter> currently if i have more than one of it on the page, they conflict
[15:43:59] <Starcraftmazter> well how the hell do you deal with it then
[15:44:03] <shoky> you use .data()
[15:44:03] <Starcraftmazter> say you have multiple elements
[15:44:10] <shoky> to store per-element custom data
[15:44:13] <shoky> for your timer plugin
[15:44:18] <Starcraftmazter> so you pass it on init?
[15:44:19] <shoky> on the element it was called on  (this)
[15:44:34] <shoky> so:  $(this).data('mytimer', any_data_here)   for example
[15:44:40] <shoky> you don't need to pass anything for this
[15:44:51] <Starcraftmazter> im a bit confused
[15:44:54] <Starcraftmazter> so lets same simple example
[15:44:59] <Starcraftmazter> i have div1 and div2 classes
[15:45:06] <Starcraftmazter> and i want to make one pink, the other blue
[15:45:33] <Starcraftmazter> $('.div1').changeColor('pink'); $('.div2').changeColor('blue');
[15:45:33] <shoky> depending on what?
[15:45:37] <Starcraftmazter> like that
[15:45:44] <shoky> ok.. why do you need to care about the selector ?
[15:45:57] <Starcraftmazter> because how else do i know which div to make what?
[15:46:09] <grafi> ._.
[15:46:09] <shoky> $.fn.changeColor = function(color) { this.css('background-color', color) }
[15:46:16] <shoky> "this" is the div it was called on
[15:46:19] <shoky> that's all you need to know
[15:46:26] <Starcraftmazter> ok, now how do i select subelements only of this element?
[15:46:32] <Starcraftmazter> this.('.class') ?
[15:46:34] <shoky> and if you need to store data for subsequent calls and to avoid conflicts, use .data()
[15:46:49] <shoky> this.find('.class')
[15:47:03] <Starcraftmazter> ok ty
[15:47:13] <Starcraftmazter> is it this or $(this) ?
[15:47:27] <shoky> be aware that except for in the topmost function of your plugin (changeColor in our example) you'd need $(this) probably and not just this
[15:47:27] <jeremy-> I must have accidentally changed something and my jquery.validate() stopped working. In that, every element that my onfocusout applies to just returns valid instead of applying the error
[15:47:38] <jeremy-> is there any way i can trap why this is happening
[15:49:04] <shoky> Starcraftmazter: also highly recommend you read this  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[16:31:54] <RavenHursT> ok.. so.. .remove() is causing some unexpected behavior for me.. can someone please explain this?? http://jsfiddle.net/Troop4Christ/VL3Xk/
[16:32:53] <RavenHursT> if $elems is an array of pointers to the DOM elements.. why the heck is '.three' still in memory?? shouldn't it have gone away w/ the removal of the DOM element??
[16:33:29] <RavenHursT> And if that's not the case.. anyone got any fun tricks up their sleave for removing from the collection as well as the DOM on removal?
[16:44:59] <shoky> RavenHursT: $elems is a sort-of array of references to DOM elements, yes. it's removed from the DOM but the object is still in memory
[16:45:57] <RavenHursT> shoky.. yeah.. I know.. just seems wonky that it wouldn't remove it from there since the items in memory supposedly reference the DOM.. if the reference dissapears you'd think the other would.
[16:46:02] <RavenHursT> or at least point to 'null'
[16:46:28] <shoky> RavenHursT: and to remove from the collection you either re-query the DOM or you filter $elems using a filter method such as .filter or .not
[16:47:08] <shoky> the reference didn't disappear though
[16:47:12] <RavenHursT> shoky: yeah.. that's what I ended up doing.. used .not() to filter the collection.. still seems like you should be able to send a flag to .remove() or something..
[16:47:15] <shoky> you're still holding on to it
[16:47:40] <shoky> a flag that'd do what?
[16:53:26] <RavenHursT> shoky: something like .remove(true) -> goes and runs .not(this) on all the jQuery objects currently held in memory..
[16:55:16] <petey> Is there any alternative to scrollspy?
[16:55:27] <petey> The github repo doesn't have very many examples
[17:05:59] <hetii> Hi :)
[17:08:01] <hetii> Q: i add to my ul checkboxes inputs  by $( "#places" ).append('<li>...</li>'), then have a selector like: $( "#places input:checkbox:checked" ) ...
[17:08:31] <hetii> The issue is in that he don`t see my items that are added in fly by .append() method
[17:08:45] <Soltis> var t = $('#myel'); var v = 1; t.val(v); console.log(t); #Why does does the value of myel not get updated?
[17:09:29] <sunbeam> is there a way to have footer stick alt with jquery when the footer has variable height?
[17:09:51] <Soltis> If I copy/paste the code into the browser console it works
[17:10:05] <Soltis> And I'm sure it was working a few days ago, too
[17:11:37] <wenshan> I have a few links on a page, clicking them manually works fine, but with jQuery("a.className #idName").click(), it does nothing.
[17:11:38] <wenshan>  
[17:12:45] <wenshan> jQuery("someOtherSelector").click returns "function click() { [native code] }", whereas jQuery("a.className #idName").click returns "function (a,c){c==null&&(c=a,a=null);return arguments.length>0?this.on(b,null,a,c):this.trigger(b)}"
[17:18:37] <hetii> ok i use .on() method and all works fine in my case... :)
[17:25:58] <sunbeam> $('#footer').position().top
[17:26:05] <sunbeam> What does this do?
[17:50:50] <robdev> http://pastebin.com/REL32TKD in my searchdesign.php, requesting $_GET['search_val'] returns nothing... I'm trying to pass a variable to use in searchdesign.php
[17:51:33] <robdev> or $_GET['data'], sorry
[17:52:17] <robdev> jsondecoding and then setting a variable to ['search_val']
[17:52:27] <robdev> the variable is empty
[17:56:43] <JarolinVargas> Anyone here can hel me apply Jquery BBQ?
[17:57:48] <synth_> i've got a document which div elements are being populated with php code. each div is to have a hover and click action. the code i currently have (http://pastebin.com/ckeHchVz) doesn't seem to work. could anyone offer any pointers? to be specific, each div element receives a ".img_info_new" class, however, i can't seem to apply these mouse events to them
[18:03:42] <makerop> hi, im trying to get the jquery ui slider plugin to work, but cant seem to get it to become a slider
[18:03:58] <makerop> css/js is on the page, and Im getting no errors in the console
[18:05:16] <shoky> `ftjq
[18:05:16] <b-ot> shoky: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[18:05:18] <robdev> I tried this and it doesn't seem to work either - http://pastebin.com/J62bphwA
[18:06:14] <makerop> https://gist.github.com/makerops/7922136
[18:07:44] <shoky> robdev:  jQuery.ajax({url:..., data: { search_val: jQuery('#catsearchContainer #catsearch').val() }, success: ...})
[18:08:10] <shoky> robdev and if you're doing a POST then you'll want $_POST['search_val']
[18:08:32] <robdev> doh!
[18:08:50] <makerop> I was just able to get it to throw an error, by issuing an option
[18:08:59] <makerop> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on slider prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[18:09:03] <jwmann> Can someone help me figure out how to put a similar JSON array based on 'check'ed .foo elements in my data-my-list attribute when I click 'Save & Show'? http://jsfiddle.net/Ubb8R/
[18:10:03] <shoky> makerop: use the slider like they do in the examples and docs
[18:10:52] <shoky> makerop: also you're setting an option, instead of initializing
[18:12:40] <shoky> makerop: http://jsfiddle.net/78p5J/1/
[18:13:01] <makerop> ty
[18:13:41] <shoky> also you'll wanna put your jquery code inside a document.ready handler probably
[18:14:22] <robdev> shoky thank you
[18:14:27] <robdev> adjusting it worked :)
[18:23:57] <shoky> jwmann: http://jsfiddle.net/Ubb8R/1/
[18:25:59] <jwmann> shoky: map method.. hmm never used that one before
[18:26:01] <shoky> jwmann: and in case you really want to put it in the attribute (tho no reason why you should) you can do  .attr('data-my-list', JSON.stringify(list))
[18:26:42] <shoky> .each  .map  and .filter are very handy
[18:26:56] <shoky> and their counterparts $.each $.map and $.grep
[18:31:21] <jwmann> shoky: Is there a way to do it without modifying the initial data-my-list ?
[18:31:37] <shoky> without modifying what, exactly?
[18:31:41] <shoky> the attribute ?
[18:32:06] <jwmann> Well you take the JSON array from the attribute and then you modify it
[18:32:16] <shoky> i don't take anything from the attribute
[18:32:26] <shoky> i build it myself and PUT it in the .data() store
[18:34:46] <jwmann> Is there a way to do it similar the way I did it before but before I read the data from the attribute, it collects all the checked id's and modifies the data-my-list so that it looks in a similar format to what it starts as?
[18:35:26] <shoky> you want to modify it, or you dont want to modify it..? you're confusing
[18:35:53] <jwmann> I want to modify the attribute
[18:35:55] <shoky> don't ask "is there a way to do X"
[18:36:03] <shoky> ok, why?
[18:36:07] <jwmann> but I don't want reformat it.
[18:36:13] <shoky> what does that mean?
[18:36:47] <shoky> how is the format any different, in my fiddle
[18:37:43] <jwmann> Hmm let me try and articulate it better :X
[18:37:51] <shoky> just answer my questions
[18:40:51] <jwmann> Actually, I'm completely mistaken. This will work perfectly fine. Sorry for being confusing -.-
[18:41:22] <shoky> np
[18:41:49] <mehwork> on a jquery mobile page with no backend, how do you execute a <script src=".."> only if on an ipad?
[18:43:10] <ir7466> Hello. If I have a login form, that I want to "swipe" off the page when the user submits it before a new screen loads... what would that be called; is there a particular name for that transition?
[18:43:23] <mehwork> in other words, is there a javascript equivalent of <script src="...">
[18:44:39] <shoky> mehwork: $('<script src="..">').appendTo('head')
[18:45:16] <mehwork> thanks
[18:46:10] <mehwork> shoky: though the problem with that is getting it to load that into the right spot in the head, since it has to be
[18:46:36] <shoky> if there are dependency issues then yea that could be a problem
[18:46:43] <shoky> unless you load it all with js ;p
[18:47:06] <shoky> or maybe "defer" attributes or something on the script tags, i donno much bout those
[18:47:54] <shoky> (and injecting the <Script> tag into the right spot in the head isn't a solution)
[19:05:13] <Cryp71c> With $.ajax, can you use datatype: json and with type 'GET' or is datatype just a POST thing?
[19:07:25] <jwmann> shoky: If I save list like this data(myList, list); and try to read from it like data(myList) -- I get an error like this: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-my-id=13,15,19]
[19:22:03] <jwmann> Nevermind, I'm an idiot *facepalm*
[20:14:16] <ndimatteo> hey all, I'm having a weird problem in IE8+9 with jquery backstretch, for some reason the <img> isn't showing up at all, despite the tag and source being there. Can someone take a look here: http://waypointe.nickdimatteo.com
[22:29:05] <Libin> can someone please be kind enough to check if the json that i have created is valid.. i have used the online editor, it shows valid.. but its not formatted , and not quite human friendly to be read.. does that make a json invalid
[22:36:18] <ali4ever4> libin: well json are not ment to be humen readable
[22:37:13] <Libin> ok.. ali4ever4 : can you check this url http://viking.applicate.co.nz/Umbraco/api/contentDetails/Presentation
[22:37:51] <Libin> i have checked that contents on a online validator , it shows valid.. can you please let me know if there is anything wrong in that json
[22:38:25] <Velveeta> chrome is showing " SyntaxError: Unexpected token : "
[22:38:56] <Libin> velveeta : is that message for me
[22:39:02] <Velveeta> yes
[22:39:33] <ali4ever4> Libin : well it looks ok for me and if the online validator validated it , it must be ok as well since the validator will create java object out of it and if no error so all your brackets are ok
[22:40:00] <Libin> thanks ali
[22:40:25] <Libin> Velveeta : Can u please check once again, I am getting the json through
[22:40:33] <Libin> and so does ali
[22:40:56] <Velveeta> yes, if i put it in as-is, it chokes on it, but i think that's just chrome, if i wrap it in an array wrapper, it evaluates just fine
[22:41:08] <Velveeta> soâ€¦â€¦.. then, were you even having a problem with this in the beginning?
[22:41:25] <Velveeta> or did you just want someone to verify that it was valid json?
[22:41:58] <Libin> it was working all good to me, and consuming it the right way in my app.. but the client just got back to me saying its a invalid json
[22:42:33] <Velveeta> they may have been doing the same thing i did at first, just copy/pasting it into a js console in chrome or something
[22:42:50] <Libin> ok
[22:43:05] <Velveeta> for some reason, chrome was choking on that paste just as it was, but wrapped in an array wrapper, it took it just fine, and index 0 was a valid object
[22:43:08] <ali4ever4> velveeta : the error you got cause you are putting json in consol without assigning it to any variable
[22:43:26] <ali4ever4> Velveeta: try something like s= jsontext
[22:43:27] <Velveeta> but i can put json in the console just fine typically
[22:43:48] <Velveeta> yeah that works
[22:43:58] <Libin> the only odd thing that I did was i created this json out of string manually, as it was too hard to create out of model class
[22:44:05] <Velveeta> and if i do: { foo: true } it doesn't choke, but it also doesn't show me an object, it just shows "true"
[22:45:00] <Velveeta> ok, i have to be up in 4 hours, adios for tonight :)
[22:45:36] <lemonsparrow> can anyone help me with this syntax error http://pastebin.com/XwnTc1hF
[22:46:08] <ali4ever4> Velveeta : try {"foo":"true"}
[22:48:05] <ali4ever4> Libin: only thing different in your json is that you are putting the variable names in qouts "" like "auth"  , i usually keep variable names out of qouts only string values will be in qouts
[22:48:41] <vhsjon> Hi guys, I have an input type=number that I validate by adding an error class like this: http://pastebin.com/nBx3exKD . The error class gives the html-element a red frame, which is correct. But, when I press my "Register" button, it seems like my input type looses its error class, because it then validates to OK. Any ideas on how I can fix this?
[22:49:05] <ali4ever4> Libin: i am not sure if this creates an issue in json , but most probably thats why chrome is giving error to Velveeta and the same reason your client is telling you its not valid
[22:50:00] <lemonsparrow> can anyone help me with this syntax error http://pastebin.com/XwnTc1hF
[22:51:39] <ali4ever4> vhsjon: most probably your register button is sumitting the form and the form action is going to the same page, this way the page is reloaded thats why you are lossing the red frame effect
[22:52:38] <vhsjon> all4ever4: yeah, thats what I figured. Its a JS web-app, and the pages are filled up dynamically
[22:52:50] <vhsjon> but its not a form
[22:55:06] <vhsjon> all my dynamically added element is inside a .observationValuesList, and if I do $(".observationValuesList").each(function(){ console.log($(this).attr("class"); }); when I press the "Register" button, and at that time, the .observationValuesList contains children with red frames, and when I inspect the HTML file, the error class is also present, bu
[22:55:06] <vhsjon> t when I press the button, no HTML elements has the error class
[22:57:27] <lemonsparrow> d
[22:57:32] <lemonsparrow> can anyone help me with this syntax error http://pastebin.com/XwnTc1hF
[23:04:20] <ali4ever4> vhsjon : what your register botton is doing on click ?
[23:04:54] <vhsjon> all4ever4: yeah, on click or ontouch, depends what platform
[23:05:56] <vhsjon> if I print out the classes of the element that is triggering the change event it does not say that it contains the error class even though if I inspect it, it has the error class, and it has red frame...
[23:08:05] <ali4ever4> vhsjon: really strange if your register button on click is not submitting a form nor reloading the page , nore messing around with classes of the input box
[23:08:29] <vhsjon> not really..
[23:10:17] <vhsjon> Im building up a registration object, where I can fill out several different observations in different pages. => this button only builds up parts of an object which I am later going to send in/submit form
