[00:04:54] <Guest35731> i am not new to jquery
[00:05:31] <Guest35731> i am not unfamiliar with javascript however i am very very coonfused on to what is happening and why my load is starting with aa positive number and not a negative
[00:05:43] <Guest35731> www.thinkrium.com/samples/msae_clickable/simple
[00:06:17] <Guest35731> disregard the gear
[00:06:19] <Guest35731> image
[00:07:30] <Guest35731> what is confusing me is that the background image is fine with whne it loads straight up but if it refreshes
[00:07:40] <Guest35731> at a scrolled position
[00:08:10] <Guest35731> it starts positive instead of negative
[00:09:02] <Guest35731> wht in the world is going on
[00:09:20] <Guest35731> i have set this load position to negative and yet it comes up > 0 every time
[00:46:50] <d3m0n> Does anyone know of a maintained jquery password strength plugin?
[01:18:50] <Cork> d3m0n: the problem isn't just maintained, but one that actually give a meaningful value
[01:19:13] <Cork> most password strength meters isn't showing actual password strength
[02:33:51] <d3m0n> Cork: Do you know of one the does?
[02:37:24] <rhizome> most probably just count length and the number of character classes
[02:43:34] <Sourcey> Hello. I have a name of a div id in a variable like this : var divid = 'somename'. how can I now hide divid? $(divid).hide() does not seem to work
[02:45:23] <Sourcey> nevermind, figured it out
[02:51:37] <itsgokul> how can i display image when hovering over a div attribute
[03:33:20] <Sourcey> Hello. I have a var with a number. I want to use this number to refer to a index in a array. Like this : array[myNumber] - but it doesnt seem to work
[03:45:57] <destinydriven> http://jsbin.com/yujigiyoju  how can I get the index of the two select inputs in the footer of this table?
[03:49:01] <destinydriven> I tried something like var foo = $( "#datatable_fixed_column tfoot" ).index( this );
[05:23:19] <computer2000> Hi, I'm looping through an array containing text strings but when I print them out I get each value split up into chars, why's that
[05:26:53] <Cork> d3m0n: https://password.kaspersky.com/, though it isn't a lib
[05:26:58] <Cork> d3m0n: also check https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/03/02/why-you-cant-trust-password-strength-meters/
[05:27:21] <Cork> computer2000: you looping it with $.each?
[05:27:22] <d3m0n> Thank you cork
[05:27:29] <computer2000> Cork: yes
[05:27:38] <Cork> and you use "this"?
[05:28:06] <d3m0n> "Those who saw a meter tended to choose stronger passwords than those who didn’t, but the type of meter did not make a significant difference."
[05:28:08] <d3m0n> lol
[05:28:18] <d3m0n> That's a win in my book
[05:28:37] <Cork> d3m0n: the point was the "common pattern" part
[05:28:47] <computer2000> Cork: yes
[05:28:52] <Cork> StrongPassword123 == week
[05:29:02] <computer2000> Cork: well I use $(this)
[05:29:12] <Cork> uh $() on a string?
[05:29:58] <Cork> computer2000: $.each is meant to use to loop objects and elements so it creates objects of what you loop
[05:30:06] <Cork> so it generates an object of the string
[05:30:19] <computer2000> Cork: ok should I just use for loop instead
[05:30:20] <Cork> where each character becomes a separate value
[05:30:29] <Cork> there are three options
[05:30:36] <Cork> use a loop, use this.toString()
[05:30:49] <Cork> or use $.each(arr, function(i, value) { value })
[05:31:20] <Cork> (wow i put i and value in the correct order for once...)
[05:32:28] <computer2000> Cork: using a normal for loop now thanks
[05:37:31] <printForever> Cork, can I bother you to check this out? https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3320
[05:37:57] <printForever> I'm having the exact oposite problem... I need to keep the dropdown open. I tried few things, but I cant get it to work.
[05:39:13] <Cork> printForever: never used select2, you would have to dig into the plugin and check what events closes the dropdown
[05:39:25] <Cork> and from there see what events you need to override
[05:39:46] <printForever> any starting ideas?
[05:40:43] <aleksa> I'm trying to make a function that would set the value of some input based on name. Since there are many inputs with same name, I managed to do it using loop. This applies to javascript. Now, I would like to write it in jquery, but it doesn't work. It only sets the value for the first input with the name, others are not set.
[05:40:51] <aleksa> http://paste.ofcode.org/Bsm9r57qZuLaQ7sQ822nm
[05:40:59] <aleksa> how to make it work in jquery?
[05:48:34] <Serg_Penguin> I am creating set of co-operating plugins, what is best practice to access properties of one plugin from another before it's applied to any element ? (incapsulation played nasty prank on me)
[05:50:18] <Xatenev> aleksa: instead of a for loop you should use the .each loop jquery provides
[05:50:26] <Xatenev> `each
[05:50:29] <Xatenev> ._.
[05:51:02] <aleksa> Xatenev, ok
[05:51:06] <aleksa> I'll try
[05:54:19] <Vinz> Hey guys, something on?
[05:54:28] <Vinz> someone* lol im sleepy!
[05:55:13] <aleksa> Xatenev,  http://paste.ofcode.org/V2A2bBt7J2JZHG8v88eqsx --> am I doing it right?
[05:55:25] <Xatenev> aleksa: no
[05:55:31] <aleksa> Now it doesn't even set the value for the first input
[05:55:41] <Xatenev> $.each('selector',function() { $(this).value(mysave)});
[05:55:45] <Xatenev> something like that
[05:55:58] <aleksa> ok
[05:59:07] <aleksa> Xatenev, still nothing:  $.each($('[name="hiddeninput"]'),function() { $(this).value(mysave)});
[05:59:22] <aleksa> Xatenev, sorry
[05:59:31] <aleksa> I forgot to change $(this)
[05:59:33] <aleksa> I'm dumb
[05:59:36] <aleksa> :(
[06:00:24] <aleksa> or should I change it? Isn't $(this) that come from each?
[06:01:35] <Xatenev> aleksa: $(this) should be the dom element you have in that loop, that should work
[06:01:37] <Xatenev> aleksa: just debug
[06:01:42] <Xatenev> aleksa: console.log($(this)
[06:02:00] <Xatenev> aleksa: aswell you can write function(index,value) { console.log(index,value,$(this));
[06:02:20] <Xatenev> aleksa: Cause that should work fine I think
[06:07:58] <aleksa> Xatenev, still no luck
[06:08:30] <aleksa> I've tried even this: $('[name="hiddeninput"]').each(function() {console.log( $( this ).text() ); $(this).value(mysave);
[06:09:10] <aleksa> it says: TypeError: $(...).value is not a function. And it points to the last line: $this.value(mysave);
[06:09:47] <Xatenev> its $(this) instead of $this
[06:10:12] <jerit> ^
[06:10:22] <jerit> unless "this" is a variable you've declared
[06:11:01] <aleksa> it's well written in code: $(this). I wrote it wrong here
[06:12:41] <Xatenev> so console.log($(this));
[06:12:45] <Xatenev> and see if you get a DOM element back there
[06:14:17] <aleksa> Object { 0: <textarea#hiddeninput>, context: <textarea#hiddeninput>, length: 1 }
[06:14:26] <aleksa> $(this) is an object?
[06:14:30] <aleksa> wow
[06:15:35] <aleksa> guys, this is seriously not working :(
[06:16:12] <aleksa> I just need to loop through all inputs with same name and change their values. Why is this so complicated thing to do in jquery?
[06:19:59] <jerit> aleksa, look up .each() which will iterate through all matching elements and allow you to change their values in there
[06:20:55] <aleksa> jerit, may I get the sample code or, I know it's too much to ask, an example for this specific problem? You know, I'm a beginner. Everything is strange to me.
[06:21:26] <jerit> so like $("ul#menu li").each(function () { $(this).class("something"); }); will set the class attribuate value for each <li> in <ul id="menu"> to "something"
[06:23:29] <aleksa> ok
[06:23:31] <aleksa> :)
[06:26:02] <G66K> hello everyone
[06:26:26] <G66K> i was wondering how to hide/show forms registeration/login
[06:26:27] <jerit> sup
[06:26:52] <G66K> i have 2 forms with id (register/login)
[06:27:16] <G66K> and 2 button with class register/login
[06:27:25] <jerit> G66K I assume $("form#login").css("display", "none"); doesn't adequately suit your needs?
[06:27:44] <Xatenev> G66K: $('selector').hide(); $('selector').show(); ?: O
[06:27:51] <jerit> that works too
[06:28:09] <jerit> Xatenev I think his problem might be to do with targeting the correct form on the button click though
[06:29:04] <Xatenev> jerit: who knows
[06:29:29] <G66K> thanks guys i will try one from above
[06:29:37] <jerit> If I'm correct on that assumption I might go with something like $('form#' + $(this).class()).show(); $('form#' + $(this).class()).hide();
[06:29:54] <jerit> or even .toggle() might work nice too
[06:30:05] <Xatenev> $('buttonSelector').on('click', function() { $(this).parentsUntil('form').parent().hide() });
[06:30:23] <Xatenev> I gues we posted enough random code now, one of that will work :O
[06:30:29] <jerit> haha
[06:31:20] <G66K> correctly . i have one more question
[06:31:35] <G66K> how to hide form on page load by default
[06:31:59] <Xatenev> inside your css .id { display: none } :O ?
[06:32:03] <G66K> like set default action on specific forms
[06:32:04] <jerit> or even $(document).ready(function () { // hide the form });
[06:32:12] * jerit wonders if any googling has been done here
[06:32:39] <jerit> Xatenev I don't understand what parentsUntil does
[06:33:03] <Xatenev> jerit: parentsuntil calls .parent() aslong as you reach the selector given as parameter
[06:33:11] <Xatenev> jerit: and then delivers the last parent of that
[06:33:20] <G66K> jerif you just been nice
[06:34:08] <Xatenev> jerit: but as the doc states: " but not including the one matched by the .parentsUntil() selector."
[06:37:17] <jerit> Xatenev so if you wanted the "level-1" element on the doc, you'd have to do .parentsUntil('level-1').parent() then?
[06:37:23] <Xatenev> ye
[06:37:30] <jerit> I see you did in your example so I guess I'm understanding correctly
[06:37:37] <Xatenev> parentsUntil('.level-1') tho
[06:39:08] <Xatenev> theres prevUntil, nextUntil() aswell btw
[06:41:08] <jerit> but that wouldn't necessarily operate exclusively within the parent of the selector would it
[06:42:17] <Xatenev> I dont know, ive never used them yet, probably gotta try it out
[06:42:23] <shoky> usually you want .closest(), not .parentsUntil
[06:42:33] <shoky> $(this).closest('form').hide()
[06:43:33] <jerit> how does .closest() determine which element to use? Closest in terms of line distance on the page or closest pixel distance from the selected element?
[06:43:58] <shoky> jerit: read the docs. it just goes to parent, parent of parent, etc
[06:44:42] <shoky> closest in terms of "is the closest ancestor that matches the selector"
[06:45:29] <G66K> everythings was working effective, the problem is jquery wasnt load
[06:48:18] <jerit> G66K I still have that problem
[06:48:22] <jerit> occasionally
[06:51:52] <Serg_Penguin> how to write plugin w/ multiple methods but w/o jQuery UI widget factory ? (don't want heavy dependency)
[06:55:26] <shoky> Serg_Penguin http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[06:57:19] <Serg_Penguin> aha ! why archive ? was it deleted from original ?
[06:58:22] <shoky> yep :(
[06:59:07] <shoky> and i don't like what replaced it, so i keep that archive page bookmarked ;p
[07:04:08] <neo12> i'd like to place the cursor on input field in addition to removing the defeult text (which I am doing by remocing placeholder attr)
[07:04:45] <shoky> .focus()
[07:06:05] <neo12> shoky: remocing the placeholder attr on the event focus, how do I place the cursor inside the input field?
[07:07:14] <JSDev> Hey guys, I'm having an issue trying to develop a jQuery plugin in ES6
[07:07:16] <shoky> neo12: you can call .focus() on the input to place the cursor inside. i didn't mean a focus event handler
[07:07:38] <JSDev> $(".js-jcrop-target").something({...}, function () { console.log(this); });
[07:08:00] <JSDev> this becomes the instance of plugin. When I change it to () => { console.log(this); } it becomes my class instance
[07:08:23] <shoky> JSDev  because arrow functions preserve the outer `this`
[07:08:35] <JSDev> The thing is, the plugin doesn't support applying itself to function. So I cannot do (instance) => { console.log(instance);
[07:08:45] <JSDev> and keep "this" as my class instance
[07:08:49] <JSDev> What can I do in this case?
[07:09:07] <neo12> ah!
[07:09:36] <JSDev> shoky: I know. Is there any way to use ES6 shorthand functions and somehow access to the plugin instance?
[07:10:01] <shoky> JSDev: depends on the plugin i guess, don't know of a general way
[07:10:16] <JSDev> It is jCrop... a bit ancient I suppose
[07:10:37] <shoky> and it only gives you the instance via `this` in event handlers..?
[07:12:56] <shoky> JSDev seems there's another way to initialize it that'll return you the instance.  or you could just use a regular function here ;p
[07:13:21] <JSDev> If I use a regular function, how can I access to my class scope? :p
[07:13:29] <JSDev> that = this beforehand?
[07:13:34] <Serg_Penguin> in plugin methods, should i always return the element ? what if I need to return something other, like success or failure of operation ?
[07:13:46] <neo12> name of the event that listen for the first char input?
[07:13:56] <neo12> if there is one.
[07:14:38] <shoky> JSDev: yea i guess.  you can also get the jcrop instance via  .data('Jcrop')
[07:15:24] <neo12> does that make sense?
[07:15:39] <JSDev> shoky: Thanks for the help. I'll try refactoring this little piece of shit, otherwise I'll just CTRL Z everything and keep it like that ;D
[07:16:52] <shoky> Serg_Penguin: it's up to you.. if you want the method to be chainable it needs to return `this`
[07:18:44] <Serg_Penguin> aha ... not so hard need, I just try to implement $('ul.fill-me').insertFilterSort('insert',$elem,dataFrom)
[07:19:37] <neo12> nvm
[07:31:08] <itsgokul> how can i reload page after window.print
[07:31:19] <itsgokul> window.location.reload dont work
[07:59:43] <Serg_Penguin> how to do locking in javascript/jquery ? I will insert into list from async AJAX responces, and i'm afraid of race conditions
[08:01:31] <shoky> var locked = true;     :P
[08:02:41] <Serg_Penguin> no, locking is about atomic operations, like compare-and-increment
[08:03:05] <shoky> javascript is single-threaded, you don't need to worry about that
[08:04:12] <Serg_Penguin> so no races in my case, unless very contrived purposeful counter-example ?
[08:04:19] <Serg_Penguin> like mem leak in java ;)
[08:05:04] <shoky> you can still have race conditions in your own logic,  but any code you run is always run atomically
[08:06:00] <Serg_Penguin> hmm, I still wonder am i at risk if I insert into DOM with sorting from async AJAX responses ?
[08:06:37] <shoky> if the order of insertion matters, then sure. like i said, you still need your own logic to be good :P
[08:09:12] <Serg_Penguin> hmm, if i'm inside function _binarySearchInsert(), it has one entry and no callbacks, I'm still at risk ?
[08:10:22] <shoky> nothing else will run while that's executed  (unless it has async stuff like setTimeout that will only run later)
[08:11:03] <Serg_Penguin> so inside plain function i'm absolutely safe ?
[08:11:41] <shoky> i already answered. "safe" depends on your own logic
[08:11:59] <shoky> but you're safe that nothing else will run while your current execution block is running
[08:12:21] <jerit> don't suppose you can multithread jquery lol
[08:12:32] <shoky> jquery is just a javascript library
[08:12:40] <shoky> it doesn't add any capabilities to javascript ;p
[08:19:53] <jomofcw> The website seems to be down :(...
[08:20:37] <jomofcw> Hm hm... "is it down just for me" say that it's just me... :/.
[08:20:47] <jomofcw> back :D
[08:24:04] <pmehta> Hi can anybody tell me why this isn't working --> https://jsbin.com/peheliheyu/edit?html,output while this is  ---> http://jsfiddle.net/Xeoncross/y7r1xe0t/
[08:32:53] <pmehta> please?
[08:34:59] <shoky> pmehta:
[08:35:02] <shoky> oops
[08:35:49] <pmehta> shoky: yes?
[08:42:02] <Serg_Penguin> how should i call a plugin method without it being intialized on any DOM object, or init-with-create ? I was having incapsulated plugins for many widgets what were self-loading given only ID and then replaced 'stub' element with real template, but now I want to make sorted list out of them so only can render then all data is here
[08:42:21] <shoky> pmehta: that's an angular question, not jquery.  and it's because of missing ng-app
[08:42:34] <Felishia> where can I download jquery 2 minified?
[08:43:08] <Serg_Penguin> Felishia, google 'jquery cdn'
[08:43:20] <shoky> Felishia:  http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.2.min.js
[08:44:30] <Felishia> shoky, how did you do that?
[08:44:34] <Felishia> the cdn is down
[08:44:38] <Felishia> OMG I guess cache
[08:44:44] <Felishia> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.3.min.js
[08:44:48] <Felishia> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.min.js
[08:44:52] <shoky> Felishia: only the https is down ;p
[08:44:56] <Felishia> ohhhh
[08:46:53] <YamakasY> when I have a javascipt which I call /foo/bar/actioninphp/subsction-$id and I'm @ /foo/bar and that works but when I'm calling it from /foo it doesn't work and no errors are shown... is that a javascript (security) boundry ?
[08:47:15] <YamakasY> I get data in my response btw
[08:50:15] <django452> Is code.jquery.com down?
[08:50:41] <django452> Is there anywhere else I can download the jquery files from to get them locally on my server?
[08:50:53] <shoky> django452 only the https is down. http works fine
[08:51:15] <django452> Oh I see. Thank you :-)
[08:53:02] <YamakasY> django452: always use your own local repo ?
[08:53:28] <django452> Yes I always do that. It is another developer that chose to use the CDN.
[08:54:12] <YamakasY> django452: devs that go for the most easy solution suck anyways
[08:54:33] <decx> what a ridiculous statement
[08:54:36] <YamakasY> if they cannot tell why they did it or it's not a valid reason without fallback... ditch them
[08:55:16] <YamakasY> decx: nope, it's just the way that current dev think how the world works
[08:55:26] <YamakasY> don't call them after 5pm also
[08:55:26] <shoky> devs also make mistakes sometimes
[08:55:36] <YamakasY> that is not a misstake, that is bad design
[08:55:38] <decx> luv generalization
[08:55:55] <shoky> yes, switching a <script> url  is bad design...
[08:56:00] <YamakasY> decx: general type of programming are called standards, current devs don't know them anymore
[08:56:29] <decx> do you even read what you write?
[08:59:00] <YamakasY> decx: sure, do you even think about what you read ?
[08:59:02] <YamakasY> guess not
[08:59:26] <decx> yeah i read a bunch of bs designed to make oneself feel better
[09:00:45] <jerit> decx I just drink to do that
[09:00:53] <jerit> it only works for a little while though
[09:01:02] <YamakasY> decx: nope, just to tell you what you need to teach that dev
[09:01:11] <YamakasY> or have your own repo ready to fallback to
[09:02:27] <decx> you tried to establish a pattern that programmers in this day and age are shit, disregarding the fact that there have always been shit programmers
[09:05:04] <neo12> why is the .val().length returning "1" when input field is visibly empty or is this norm?
[09:05:10] <neo12> if so I can check for 1
[09:05:15] <neo12> instead of zerp
[09:05:18] <neo12> zero*
[09:05:48] <Serg_Penguin> how can i find out, why cat.meow() is 'Error: not a function' but cat.prototype.meow() does meow ?
[09:06:33] <Xatenev> neo12: it should be 0
[09:06:59] <neo12> hmm
[09:14:12] <destinydriven> hey guys http://jsbin.com/yujigiyoju  how can I get the index of the two select inputs in the footer of this table?
[09:27:40] <isotope> Anyone here work with Isotope.js?
[09:28:56] <decx> index is relative destinydriven
[09:30:17] <destinydriven> decx, yeah, I realize. I only want to get the index of th for the select
[09:30:35] <destinydriven> no matter what I try I'm getting 0 where I expect 3 and 4
[09:31:00] <decx> well you probably get index from the select no?
[09:31:13] <YamakasY> decx: erm I did not, I just said that type of people are bad proggrammers, as you just have expercienced
[09:31:23] <decx> closest('th').index() should do
[09:31:50] <destinydriven> decx, brb, have an issue with my irc client.  Lines are being truncated
[09:31:57] <decx> YamakasY: nope you sounded like an old dick saying "these young kids and their barock music"
[09:32:21] <isotope> Is it still possible to display an "Error: No results found
[09:33:00] <isotope> Is it still possible to display an "Error: No results found" div in Isotope.JS? I am trying to do with an if/else, but can't seem to get the length of my container
[09:33:37] <neo12> whats the name of the event that catches all char input?
[09:33:50] <YamakasY> decx: I have my reasons ;)
[09:33:57] <Xatenev> neo12: keypress?
[09:34:01] <neo12> i'm using keypress and keydown
[09:34:16] <YamakasY> decx: anyways, look at facebook, most are doing selfies in front of their monitor too :P
[09:34:22] <neo12> the .val() for a single char returns length 0
[09:34:32] <decx> i get triggered when somebody calls a programmer lazy and it's not meant as a compliment, the whole point of this job is to do less work ^^
[09:34:39] <taplar> neo12: what are you trying to do?
[09:34:42] <pmehta> shoky++
[09:34:47] <destinydriven> decx, thanks, that works for the first select but it also returns 3 for the 4th 'th'
[09:34:54] <Xatenev> YamakasY: what is wrong about doing selfies in front of your monitor?
[09:34:57] <Xatenev> YamakasY: oo
[09:35:00] <decx> destinydriven: well it starts at 0
[09:35:02] <pmehta> shoky: thank you thank you! life savior
[09:35:15] <neo12> i;m trying to remove something when the input field is zero
[09:35:27] <YamakasY> Xatenev: it makes you boss see you are less productive and focussed
[09:35:31] <taplar> neo12: i mean throw up a fiddle with what your trying ot do
[09:35:32] <YamakasY> it explains misstakes :P
[09:35:39] <Xatenev> YamakasY: ???????
[09:35:44] <YamakasY> Xatenev: and you are flooding the internet with youir pr0n :P
[09:35:52] <Xatenev> YamakasY: thats all so bullshit lol xd
[09:36:03] <taplar> YamakasY: not sure that this is the right place to discuss social behaviors
[09:36:04] <Xatenev> YamakasY: Because you take an image of yourself your less productive? I lold
[09:36:15] <Xatenev> YamakasY: flooding the internet if you upload an image in a social network? I lold
[09:36:21] <Xatenev> YamakasY: stop talking please ._.
[09:36:49] <isotope> I'm trying to display an "error: no results found" div in my Isotope.JS grid, here is what I have but I can't seem to toggle the div on and off, any ideas? : http://codepen.io/TyStelmach/pen/bpYYqM
[09:38:21] <Xatenev> isotope: I dont think you will have much luck here asking about isotope js
[09:39:03] <isotope> Any recommendations? I don't think there is an IRC just for isotope unfortunately :(
[09:39:09] <YamakasY> Xatenev: you never heard of sarcasm ? I hope you don't do angular also :P
[09:39:14] <YamakasY> as that is pragmatic
[09:40:13] <Xatenev> isotope: well, maybe if you have a lot of luck ##javascript
[09:40:25] <Xatenev> isotope: otherwise the docs of isotope :P
[09:40:43] <Xatenev> isotope: http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/nFrte maybe this helps you i dont know
[09:40:47] <isotope> Alright, I will check it out. Thanks!
[09:40:55] <Xatenev> maybe you can copy something out of there? I dont know isotope :(
[09:41:09] <isotope> Yeah, I've checked through all of desandro's pens and still can't solve it
[09:41:52] <sliter> Hello!
[09:42:02] <taplar> aloha
[09:42:40] <sliter> Okay. I'm not really developer, but in internet, you might make everything you want (almost) in 5 mins.
[09:42:53] <destinydriven> decx, it can't differentiate between first and second select?
[09:43:18] <taplar> sliter: uhh, what's the question?
[09:43:41] <Xatenev> "I wanna do a big game with thousands of players"
[09:43:46] <Xatenev> jk
[09:43:48] <sliter> im trying to formulate a thought right now.
[09:43:58] <taplar> k
[09:44:37] <taplar> and realistically your not going to make things in 5mins
[09:44:49] <taplar> regardless, if your going to put effort into quality control
[09:45:02] <sliter> So. I have Jquery code, that displays a map. And this map (it's in svg format btw) there is options, to change colors of regions. And i wan't to get colors of this regions by mysql query.
[09:45:36] <Xatenev> sliter: and then you join into #jquery?
[09:45:42] <Xatenev> Gotta go, sry
[09:45:42] <sliter> Yep, sort of.
[09:46:12] <sliter> I've find code, that makes query to php file, that than connects with mysql
[09:46:39] <sliter> But how do i put response of this connection into map "configuration"
[09:47:01] <sliter> Btw i don't know any of Jquery.
[09:47:39] <taplar> you should take a look at learn.jquery.com
[09:47:55] <taplar> if your looking for a solution, that's not really what this room is about
[09:47:57] <sliter> Nah, 2long4meh.
[09:48:01] <sliter> Rly?
[09:48:07] <taplar> it's a teaching/support room
[09:48:12] <sliter> Is there any rooms for solutions? :p
[09:48:30] <taplar> maybe, not sure.  or you might try stackoverflow
[09:48:34] <decx> craigslist
[09:48:41] <decx> 100$/h
[09:48:55] <sliter> Okay, thank you anyway :p
[09:52:28] <taplar> who was asking about isotope
[09:52:44] <taplar> oh, they left
[10:09:12] <islalobo> Hello :) This is my script http://kopy.io/KzHDo We're using typeahead and bloodhound to create an autocomplete field. I'm trying to see if it is possible to re-initialize the bloodhound suggestion engine. The issue is related to the 'empty' api call that is made. Basically the way it works is that if there are no results it does an api call and the response from that call is inserted / updated to the database. The call works fine, but user doesn't see the 
[10:11:19] <sammmmm> anyone know how to stop the each method from continuing after if condition is true? http://pastebin.com/HNrdNZHF
[10:12:18] <taplar> so you only want it to do the logic for the first required textarea?
[10:13:37] <sammmmm> yeah
[10:17:28] <taplar> personally i'd use filter
[10:18:12] <taplar> $("textarea").filter(function(){ return $(this).prop('required'); }).first().each(...)
[10:18:23] <taplar> or do without the each, store it in a var and just do it
[10:18:51] <taplar> sorry for the delay, i had to step away for a moment
[10:30:38] <vish93> Hi guys, I have implemented touchswipe, with jcarousel, but the swipe is triggering on all elements with that class: i'am using  $('.jcarousel-control-next').trigger('click');
[10:31:15] <vish93> How could I target only the carousel that the swipe occurs on
[10:44:57] <vish93> ?
[10:53:14] <sliter> Okay, it's sort of getting better now.
[10:53:20] <sliter> I have random color generation.
[10:53:33] <sliter> Don't think mysql connection will be really harder.
[10:54:46] <shoky> lol
[10:55:09] <neo12> please run this jsfiddle and try inputting a single char in box and check console for values. It should be one, instead zero - https://jsfiddle.net/
[10:55:37] <shoky> wrong link
[10:56:35] <neo12> my bad - https://jsfiddle.net/mmzqxv4e/
[10:57:42] <taplar> change it from keypress to keyup
[10:57:56] <sliter> It shows lenght and symbols, yup
[10:57:57] <neo12> I had both
[10:58:41] <neo12> oh
[10:58:46] <neo12> never tried up
[10:59:14] <neo12> ah!
[10:59:23] <neo12> that worked
[10:59:28] <neo12> difference is?
[10:59:52] <taplar> keypress fires repeatedly while the key is held
[11:00:20] <taplar> your interested in after the user has finished the key events entirely
[11:00:27] <neo12> right
[11:36:04] <choro> hey, can anybody help me speed up some of my code? i have some ajax calls and .append stuff, but i get about 600ms (estimated) of unresponsiveness each time.
[11:36:13] <choro> ill provide code in one moment
[11:40:08] <Uhkis> choro: dont append in loop
[11:40:51] <sliter> Why i get "object Object" when i do alret(generateColors())?  http://pastebin.com/9nhSR9xx
[11:41:23] <choro> Uhkis: what should i do then? when the during the $.each loop, should i append everything to a string (postHTMLString += "<div...") then append THAT to the element outside of the loop?
[11:42:08] <Uhkis> choro: id use an array but string should work as well
[11:42:49] <choro> Uhkis: with an array, the only way i could think to do it would to loop through the array and append each one, which is exactly what i'm not supposed to do, unless theres a better non-loop way to do it?
[11:42:52] <sliter> [object Object] - alert, that i get. Is it normal?
[11:43:15] <decx> yes
[11:43:20] <decx> cause it's an object
[11:43:25] <choro> sliter: yes. if you wanna see the actual data, either console.log it or do alert(JSON.stringify(obj))
[11:43:25] <decx> and alert can only do strings
[11:43:27] <decx> use console
[11:43:46] <choro> but yeah, like decx said, use console for logging/tracing.
[11:43:53] <sliter> Oh, okay, thank you, i'll try using stringify
[11:44:31] <decx> no
[11:44:34] <decx> try console
[11:44:40] <decx> it'll be great
[11:45:20] <decx> a whole new world, a brand new place i never knew. all those properties and attached methods
[11:45:24] <sliter> *saw 50 raws text in alert*
[11:45:24] <sliter> Oh yeah, it will be really greater :p
[11:45:34] <sliter> rows*
[11:45:48] <choro> decx: haha, sound like when i first discovered the console.
[11:45:51] <choro> heaven on earth tbh
[11:46:17] <choro> Uhkis: doing that didn't improve the time at all, but i see i have a LOT of synchronous ajax calls (which is bad practice) so i'll fix those up asap
[11:46:58] <sliter> Okay, im sorta starting to understand all this things. But not fully
[11:47:40] <choro> what aren't you understanding?
[11:48:04] <sliter> Ahh...
[11:48:09] <sliter> I even can't describe it.
[11:48:30] <choro> well, if you figure it out, ill be here ;p
[11:48:37] <sliter> Oki :d
[11:49:39] <sliter> In this code http://pastebin.com/9nhSR9xx >for (key in map.regions) is key defined in map "*.js" file or where?
[11:50:08] <Uhkis> choro: so, post the fiddle
[11:51:01] <choro> Uhkis: right, okay. it's not gonna be functional because there's a custom API that does some ajax calls to local php files and it'll take a long time to get working in a fiddle. but yeah, ill post the code
[11:51:32] <decx> you can just ajax echo on jsfiddle and put in data manually
[11:53:24] <choro> decx: alright, give me a minute to do that then ;p
[11:53:31] <sliter> choro: In this code http://pastebin.com/9nhSR9xx "for (key in map.regions)" are key defined in map's "*.js" file or somewhere else?
[11:54:35] <choro> sliter: i'd have no way of knowing without seeing the file that map is defined in
[11:55:48] <sliter> choro: it's kinda complicated... http://pastebin.com/ycPx7tFe
[11:58:06] <decx> good lord almighty
[11:58:11] <decx> strike down that paste
[12:02:45] <choro> sliter: is... is the entirety of jQuery.mousewheel in here???
[12:03:08] <sliter> Lol. It's only jquery-jvectormap-2.0.3.min.js there :d
[12:24:03] <hainesy> Hi, was wondering if anyone could help me out please? jQuery newbie here. I'm trying to write a function that, when one of the images in list is hovered on, the main image is replaced by the hovered on image. Here is the code I've written so far. Would really appreciate any help! http://pastebin.com/E9jc8qbg
[12:26:30] <decx> what do you expect src: '.pic2' to do
[12:27:14] <hainesy> decx, so when you hover on the .pic2 it will replace the image .mainPic
[12:27:27] <hainesy> does that make sense? Is it possible?
[12:27:38] <decx> yeah but what do you expect it to do when you give a class to source?
[12:27:50] <decx> <img src=".pic2"> does that look right to you?
[12:28:01] <hainesy> no it doesn't
[12:28:09] <hainesy> so I don't need the src?
[12:28:28] <decx> you want to change the src so you need it
[12:28:37] <decx> but it has to be an actual source
[12:28:52] <hainesy> oh I see
[12:28:55] <decx> for example this.src to use the src string from the thing you mouse entered
[12:29:00] <hainesy> Im trying to replace the src with a class
[12:30:36] <hainesy> so, what should I put instead of the class
[12:30:49] <hainesy> because I want to target the element that the mouse is hovered on
[12:30:54] <decx> think about it
[12:31:00] <decx> the source of course
[12:31:39] <hainesy> of course!
[12:31:51] <hainesy> duh!
[12:31:59] <hainesy> thank you, I was being a bit blonde
[12:32:13] <hainesy> Does that mean I would have do that for each one as well?
[12:32:14] <decx> to summarize https://jsfiddle.net/pcguqbh5/
[12:35:31] <islalobo> Trying to simulate / trigger click on page load: $('.openMedicationModal #176406').trigger('click');
[12:35:54] <islalobo> When I run the above command in console the modal opens, but when I refresh the page the same code in my js file does nothing
[12:36:37] <hainesy> thanks decx :)
[12:36:44] <taplar> you trying to trigger it before the click event is bound?
[12:40:39] <sliter> How i might get object from mysql?
[12:40:53] <NoiseEee> sliter: hmmm?
[12:41:52] <sliter> Uhh. Colors, that i use in map, come as object. So, how im need to store that data in mysql to import it too as object?
[12:42:40] <islalobo> taplar:  I think so :(
[12:42:56] <taplar> sliter: you'll have to send that information to your backend with a form submit or an ajax request
[12:43:38] <taplar> your frontend doesn't know anything about mysql
[12:46:16] <islalobo> How can I ensure the event is triggered at the right moment: https://jsfiddle.net/gkrb51t4/1/
[12:46:50] <taplar> i don't see a binding in there at all
[12:49:05] <taplar> also side note, selecting the id that belongs to a class, you could just select the id only
[12:50:39] <islalobo> Binding is in a different js file. Aim is to programatically trigger opening of modal
[12:51:11] <taplar> so why are you not doing this in the same file?
[12:52:22] <SpecialTechnique> Is there anybody here that works with GTM?
[12:54:12] <NoiseEee> GTM?
[12:54:49] <taplar> google tag manager?
[12:55:01] <NoiseEee> grand theft turkeys
[12:55:11] <taplar> that's GTT
[12:55:12] <decx> rather that than the tag manager
[12:55:21] <decx> "add these 5 global variables"
[12:55:26] <taplar> i was actually thinking grand thieft money
[12:55:33] <islalobo> taplar: adding it to the same file doesn't solve the issue
[12:55:58] <taplar> so if you added that logic in the same file, right after you do the binding to the elements, it does nothing
[12:55:59] <taplar> ?
[12:58:20] <islalobo> Noting, I've added the related function 'getUrlVars' and added the snippet I pasted here after the binding and nothing happens
[12:58:37] <taplar> you got something else going on then.
[13:00:04] <taplar> are you sure your selector is matching the correct element?
[13:00:46] <taplar> you've console.log'ed it and you see it found it
[13:02:01] <islalobo> I'm having issues now with getting the element to console log out, which indicates some troubling issues
[13:02:14] <taplar> ;)
[13:02:38] <islalobo> Well, actually as soon as I typed that it worked. The length is 0 tho
[13:03:00] <taplar> so it's not find anything to click
[13:03:30] <islalobo> When I run the same command in my console the trigger works
[13:03:57] <taplar> i doubt it's the same command
[13:04:02] <taplar> your code is using a variable
[13:04:29] <islalobo> I copied and pasted the exact command (updated my code with an id)
[13:04:54] <taplar> so you changed your command to not use the varaible
[13:05:27] <islalobo> vice versa, changed code to use an id (just to see if I could get it working)
[13:05:42] <taplar> have you tried console logging the variable to see what it's using?
[13:06:55] <taplar> my point is if the logic is doing $('#'+ variable) and your doing $('#jimmy') to see that it should work, your ruling out that the variable may not be what you think it is
[13:12:42] <sliter> that php btw, lol <?php defined('_JEXEC') or die; ?>
[13:12:57] <taplar> ?
[13:13:29] <sliter> Im sorta newbie to this.
[13:13:32] <islalobo> taplar I think the variable is okay though https://jsfiddle.net/gkrb51t4/2/
[13:13:54] <taplar> sliter: if your asking a php question, that's off topic for the room.  you should check out ##php
[13:14:25] <islalobo> console.log(thingToClick.selector.length) is '27'
[13:14:25] <sliter> It was sort of stupid joke, nvm :d
[13:14:44] <taplar> uh
[13:14:52] <taplar> thingToClick.length
[13:14:58] <taplar> not selector
[13:15:33] <taplar> that's (guessing) giving you the length of the selector string, not anything about the results
[13:17:56] <islalobo> Okay, so if that is still 0 how can I get the click to trigger at the appropriate time
[13:18:19] <taplar> 0 means either your selector is wrong, or that element does not exist at that time
[13:18:37] <taplar> you either need to fix your selector, bind after it is created, or do a delegate
[13:19:13] <sliter> Okay, i hope nothing will brake if i put my pc into hybernate...
[13:19:17] <sliter> Hope...
[13:20:45] <taplar> but it really should not be 0
[13:20:54] <taplar> if you put it right after the logic that is doing the click binding
[13:20:55] <islalobo> elements are dynamically creted
[13:21:02] <islalobo> *created
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> then you want a delegated listener :)
[13:21:14] <taplar> but if you put it right after the binding it wouldn't matter
[13:21:28] <taplar> unless your binding is also fubared
[13:21:36] <taplar> aka, using the same selector
[13:22:09] <islalobo> binding $('.openMedicationModal').on('click', '.add-medication, .edit-medication', function( event)
[13:22:27] <taplar> i don't see an id in that
[13:25:02] <taplar> is the id on one of those child elements with those classes?
[13:30:24] <islalobo> Okay, this also works in my console $('.openMedicationModal, .edit-medication').trigger('click');
[13:30:37] <robertmaxrees> because you're likely running that after the elements exist.
[13:30:38] <taplar> so next question, when are you building the contents of the modal?
[13:31:58] <islalobo> taplar You made a good point about the id. I use the id to populate the modal, but I don't need to pass it at that moment. The modal should exist on page load. It's included in the 'main' layout for the page type
[13:32:06] <islalobo> So, modal exists, but is empty
[13:32:13] <taplar> when do you build the contents?
[13:32:43] <islalobo> Input fields etc exist. The values are populate with js when you open
[13:32:53] <islalobo> (it's a form)
[13:33:05] <taplar> ok, so it a true statement that you want to do your click trigger logic when it opens?
[13:33:51] <taplar> cause it seems like your dynamically loading the modal, but your probably doing the trigger logic outside of that success logic
[13:34:12] <islalobo> No, I want to do click trigger on page load
[13:34:37] <taplar> so the modal is not being built with something like an ajax call?
[13:35:36] <islalobo> Values are populated, but I am not worried about that. I just want to get the trigger.click to work on page load.
[13:35:57] <taplar> ok, so i'm back to the selector possibly being bad
[13:36:02] <islalobo> The id is the value I need to populate the input values and that should be taken care of already (or I'll deal with it after)
[13:36:23] <taplar> if the element already exists on page load, and your selector is returning 0, your selector is bad
[13:36:36] <islalobo> I just don't understand how the selector could be bad if the command works in the console
[13:36:55] <robertmaxrees> because the elements don't exist on pageload.
[13:37:05] <robertmaxrees> you can't select things that don't exist.
[13:37:17] <taplar> which would be contradictory to what you believe is happening
[13:37:31] <taplar> and the code don't lie, :)
[13:38:37] <islalobo> Okay, fine, but how do I find a solution to this issue?
[13:38:49] <taplar> figure out when the element is being created
[13:38:57] <taplar> or figure out if your selector is wrong
[13:39:21] <islalobo> console.log($('.openMedicationModal, .edit-medication').length);
[13:39:22] <islalobo> $('.openMedicationModal, .edit-medication').trigger('click');j
[13:39:28] <taplar> that's not using the id
[13:39:35] <islalobo> ^^ But this gives length of 2 and doesn't work
[13:39:45] <islalobo> Same command works in console when run
[13:39:55] <taplar> try just $('#'+ yourvar ).length
[13:39:57] <taplar> and see what you get
[13:40:09] <taplar> in the code, not the console
[13:40:51] <islalobo> I don't need the variable (as you pointed out)
[13:41:03] <taplar> huh?
[13:41:47] <islalobo> $('.openMedicationModal, .edit-medication').trigger('click');
[13:41:53] <islalobo> is sufficient to open the modal
[13:42:02] <taplar> if there is only one of them, sure
[13:42:13] <thevishy> how can I create widgets/panels/dialog buttons - are there native API's for this or do I have to use a library?
[13:43:11] <robertmaxrees> thevishy huh?  you could do it on your own or use a lib.
[13:43:18] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean by "native APIs"
[13:43:45] <islalobo> taplar: there is only one
[13:44:00] <taplar> cool, ^_^
[13:44:09] <thevishy> I mean I need to create a resizable panel/widget or a dialog box, how do I do that?
[13:44:41] <islalobo> But that means I'm baffled about triggering the click
[13:44:42] <thevishy> robertmaxrees: I can see there is http://jqueryui.com/demos/ is that officially part of jQuery?
[13:44:43] <robertmaxrees> thevishy using html and css - pretty easy stuff.
[13:44:53] <robertmaxrees> thevishy that's apart of jquery UI.
[13:45:11] <thevishy> is that so robertmaxrees? you mean I don't need jquery to get these done?
[13:45:19] <robertmaxrees> you do.
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> AND jquery ui.
[13:45:41] <thevishy> I haven't seen a concept of widget in HTML as such - I saw something called <detail> </detail>
[13:46:17] <taplar> what are you calling a widget?
[13:46:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:46:22] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things :)
[13:46:36] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to build something for a web page, or something for your browser?
[13:47:00] <thevishy> that is a good question - I guess widget is something that can be minimized mazimized and dragged
[13:47:07] <robertmaxrees> thats'...
[13:47:10] <taplar> anything
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> not answering my question.
[13:47:53] <thevishy> I wanted to extend an app written in jQuery with some custom "toolboxes"
[13:48:18] <taplar> menus?
[13:48:20] <thevishy> thats my goal, so I am wondering what do I use for that
[13:48:24] <robertmaxrees> fwiw jquery is just javascript.
[13:48:28] <robertmaxrees> and it depends on what the app already has.
[13:48:33] <thevishy> actually a bit like dialog popups
[13:48:46] <thevishy> http://eubeta.nimbudocs.com/integration/samples/MinimumIntegration/minimum.html
[13:48:46] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to bring in all of jquery ui if you, say, already have bootstrap.
[13:48:57] <thevishy> thats my app btw, its an html-pdf converter
[13:49:19] <thevishy> ah right I need to see if I have bootstrap then I guess, good to know that
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:49:37] <taplar> just from the source i don't see jq or bs
[13:49:42] <taplar> and it's still loading
[13:49:48] <taplar> i guess
[13:49:57] <thevishy> :-) it takes time, but its written in jQuert, I know the development team
[13:50:10] <robertmaxrees> it's not, actually.
[13:50:12] <robertmaxrees> it's written in JS ;)
[13:50:18] <taplar> that load time needs some love
[13:50:53] <thevishy> nah, its because its from another contitent - it works fine from europe
[13:51:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need to use whatever foundation they've laid here.
[13:51:13] <robertmaxrees> looks like they're already using jquery ui though
[13:51:31] <thevishy> ah is that so, alright thats interesting, jquery ui is actually part of the official project?
[13:51:40] <robertmaxrees> that's what this looks like.
[13:51:48] <robertmaxrees> if you know the devs, why don't you ask them?
[13:51:52] <thevishy> ok then I guess it should be dine for me to use it
[13:52:06] <thevishy> I did post it to them, but I was trying to figure it out right away
[13:52:12] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:53:00] <thevishy> so perhaps then I can just use jQueri UI and create my stuff sounds fun
[13:53:14] <robertmaxrees> look at their code and documentation first.
[13:53:46] <taplar> weird, i see the jqui css, but don't see the logic
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> because it looks like they've built their own framework here.
[13:54:10] <thevishy> robertmaxrees: to be honest I needed jquery ui's for my own customization on top of that page
[13:54:20] <robertmaxrees> thevishy erm.
[13:54:21] <taplar> yeah, whatever it is, judging by the size of the min file, heh, it's massive
[13:54:25] <thevishy> they offer customization in terms of buttons etc but I needed more :)
[13:54:59] <thevishy> yeah its like pretty big I guess and they were using applets before moving to jQuery
[13:55:09] <robertmaxrees> *javascript
[13:55:30] <thevishy> yes javascript!
[13:55:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:08:30] <SpecialTech> NoiseEee yea Google Tag Manager lol
[14:12:24] <taplar> wow, that was some time gap
[14:14:44] <thevishy> :-) is that like not so common in here!
[14:15:33] <taplar> not in my experience, :)
[14:51:49] <Devrim> Would it be possible to retrieve a value/url from the console log with jquery/javascript?
[14:51:57] <taplar> no
[14:52:14] <Devrim> Would it be possible at all with greasemonkey? What would I be looking for?
[14:52:22] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[14:52:40] <Devrim> I'm trying to retrieve a m3u playlist from a HTML5 player
[14:52:58] <taplar> and your making it write out to the console?
[14:53:09] <Devrim> I can find the m3u link in the console
[14:53:24] <Devrim> I want to be able to output that link so I can click it and load it in VLC
[14:53:36] <taplar> what do you mean find it in the console?
[14:53:56] <Devrim> In Firefox when you press F12 the console log pops up
[14:54:10] <taplar> so your, in the console, executing a method to find it
[14:54:14] <Devrim> The m3u link gets output in there
[14:54:15] <taplar> not finding it 'in the console'
[14:54:16] <taplar> ;)
[14:54:47] <taplar> so yeah, greasemonkey can do whatever commands you are doing in the console
[14:55:24] <Devrim> I'm not sure what the proper name is of the "console", else I would just Google around and find a solution for it :p
[14:55:42] <taplar> the console is just a browser log thing
[14:55:53] <taplar> it's not a place you retrieve stuff from programatically
[14:56:35] <Devrim> Problem is, the HTML5 player is behind a login, and uses some weird cookie system to generate URLs
[14:56:44] <taplar> so?
[14:56:46] <Devrim> If it was possible to retrieve the url from log it would be easy :p
[14:57:08] <taplar> you have to login before you can get to it, right?
[14:57:17] <Devrim> yea
[14:57:39] <taplar> so then your greasemonkey script is targeted to that page and executes whatever it needs to do when it hits that trigger
[15:15:29] <revolve> how can i tell $.ajax what the expected form name is for a file upload, {formname: formData}, ?
[15:55:35] <jerit> guys, using jquery ui, is it possible to place modals in different places on the web page?
[16:03:47] <taplar> jerit: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[16:44:23] <goddard> my ajax request is taking 7 - 8 seconds each request for only like 30KB how can i speed this up?
[16:45:26] <goddard> the waiting time is what is taking the longest
[16:46:08] <systemfault> Fix your server
[16:49:13] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[16:52:47] <NoiseEee> whats it waiting for?  whats happening on the backend?
[16:53:55] <goddard> NoiseEee: just a database call really
[16:57:30] <goddard> NoiseEee: its only 30KB so i dont understand
[16:59:18] <NoiseEee> it doesn't matter the size of it, it matters what the backend has to do to GET you that 30k
[16:59:30] <NoiseEee> goddard: do you control the backend?  are your queries optimized?  etc etc
[17:00:11] <goddard> NoiseEee: not really it is some crappy java servlet
[17:01:31] <NoiseEee> goddard: crappy backend gonna crappy backend
[17:02:27] <thomedy> okay im really confused this should work but im getting a weird thing going on
[17:02:35] <ShaunR> Anybody know why this would run twice when a label is clicked? http://pastebin.ca/3455220
[17:02:47] <ShaunR> i'm seeing the alert "wtf" twice.
[17:02:49] <ShaunR> cant figure out why
[17:03:44] <goddard> ShaunR: probably being assigned to multiple objects when you think it is only one
[17:04:40] <ShaunR> dont see how.
[17:05:51] <goddard> i could be wrong but i would look here $('.dropdown-radio > li > label')
[17:05:53] <robertmaxrees> ShaunR or event bubbling.
[17:05:57] <thomedy> http://www.thinkrium.com/samples/msae_clickable/simple/
[17:06:48] <thomedy> the console.log only runs in the proper conditional but the rest still runs all the time
[17:06:56] <thomedy> what?
[17:07:48] <ShaunR> goddard: right, but wouldnt $('.dropdown-radio > li > label').on('click', function() {} only fire off for that one label when clicked.
[17:08:03] <robertmaxrees> ShaunR show us a fiddle or something.
[17:10:25] <thomedy> im so confused
[17:22:44] <ShaunR> is there a easy way to find the first element under $(this) that could be a few levels deep?
[17:22:59] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[17:23:57] <ShaunR> how about the first occurance of it? just like $(this).find('input:first').
[17:24:42] <robertmaxrees> or .first()
[17:24:49] <robertmaxrees> .eq(0)
[17:24:59] <ShaunR> k
[18:19:13] <thomedy> i really need help please
[18:19:21] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, ask :)
[18:19:24] <thomedy> im on it
[18:19:26] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will :D
[18:19:35] <thomedy> http://www.thinkrium.com/samples/msae_clickable/simple/
[18:19:47] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:20:00] <thomedy> I am not sure why this is not changing when i resize the screen
[18:20:10] <robertmaxrees> why what is not changing?
[18:20:10] <thomedy> if you look at the jquery which is very simple
[18:20:14] <thomedy> and i can paste bin it
[18:20:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing things change.
[18:20:45] <thomedy> i create a function that animates at different speeds on scroll when screen is over 600px
[18:20:51] <thomedy> and if it is not mobile
[18:21:04] <thomedy> but no matter what it does it
[18:21:18] <thomedy> i can console log out the param which is the screen size
[18:21:28] <robertmaxrees> you never stop the native scroll event.
[18:21:31] <thomedy> and it will work in the proper context but no matter what the screen animates
[18:21:45] <robertmaxrees> also, this is really inefficient code.
[18:22:00] <thomedy> im sure it is
[18:22:03] <thomedy> its a mark up
[18:22:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:22:16] <thomedy> thank you though i do appreciate it
[18:22:25] <thomedy> i  meant mock up
[18:22:29] <robertmaxrees> either way, you're not stopping the native scroll event.
[18:22:33] <robertmaxrees> and that's a really fleshed out mock.
[18:22:35] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[18:22:45] <robertmaxrees> you need to prevent the default scroll from firing.,
[18:22:54] <thomedy> i kind of like a modertely finished mock up to get the feel of the action
[18:23:00] <thomedy> but you must be right
[18:23:13] <robertmaxrees> mocks should be much more minimal tbh.  otherwise just build the thing.
[18:23:18] <rogger_h> http://paste.ee/p/0vCY8#BUlEuH74BUBdPW004Tu6eyx1DuDc411k
[18:23:22] <rogger_h> why do i get this error
[18:23:50] <robertmaxrees> rogger_h are you trying to use it before you declare it?
[18:23:54] <thomedy> i wasnt' sure how to get the feel of the multi speeded scroll with a simpler mock up
[18:24:01] <thomedy> but thank you on the preventDefault
[18:24:03] <rogger_h> nop
[18:24:14] <robertmaxrees> rogger_h then you're probably loading jquery multiple times.
[18:24:33] <rogger_h> hmm might be
[18:24:35] <rogger_h> let me see
[18:25:13] <thomedy> it still animates at 2 speeds
[18:25:26] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you're looking for, exactly?
[18:25:31] <thomedy> it should within 600px width just be fixed position
[18:25:38] <thomedy> robertmaxrees: are yo uasking me?
[18:25:54] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:26:06] <thomedy> okay let me run 2 versions the 1st you see already
[18:26:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:26:22] <thomedy> 2x speed animations
[18:26:30] <thomedy> if the screen is < 600px
[18:26:31] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[18:26:33] <thomedy> then you get this one sec
[18:26:38] <robertmaxrees> so you want the scroll to be twice as fast?
[18:26:53] <thomedy> right now the content scrolls 2x faster then the background
[18:26:55] <thomedy> check
[18:26:56] <thomedy> good
[18:27:08] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to setup parralax scrolling.
[18:27:22] <robertmaxrees> err, parallax
[18:27:28] <thomedy> i thought parallax was side to side but yes
[18:27:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:27:47] <thomedy> okay then yes parallax
[18:27:53] <thomedy> but i want parallax to stop on mobile
[18:28:02] <robertmaxrees> alright.  why not use a plugin to automatically handle that for you on desktop?
[18:28:06] <cannap> check for size^^
[18:28:24] <thomedy> my mobile regex works fine
[18:28:37] <thomedy> it logs out  false and true appropriately
[18:28:58] <thomedy> the parallax only should run if (!is_mobile)
[18:29:08] <thomedy> i can console.log inside and it works
[18:29:20] <thomedy> but all the animation just goes every time
[18:29:21] <thomedy> ?
[18:29:28] <thomedy> im so confused
[18:29:44] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is it's always initializing even though you think it shouldn't?
[18:29:47] <thomedy> yes
[18:29:53] <thomedy> its so weird.
[18:30:27] <thomedy> my params include the window_size which i console log out when outside of 600 and the console.log works perfectly
[18:30:36] <thomedy> but everything else fires every time
[18:31:05] <robertmaxrees> so what happens when you console.log(is_mobile) right before your if?
[18:31:30] <thomedy> well i guess i dont remember
[18:31:32] <thomedy> let me check
[18:31:33] <robertmaxrees> also: if (!is_mobile && Number(size) >= 600) - you don't need the number constructor there.
[18:31:40] <thomedy> i figured not
[18:31:48] <thomedy> because the number should already be number
[18:31:53] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:31:55] <thomedy> but i just trying to see what was wrong
[18:32:09] <thomedy> i just tested if that would fix it and hvne ttaken it off yet
[18:32:34] <robertmaxrees> log those two values in that if beforehad
[18:32:40] <robertmaxrees> *beforehand
[18:32:42] <robertmaxrees> see what you get.
[18:32:56] <thomedy> okay  i  will do that
[18:33:06] <thomedy> i m goign to deal with my children and then come back in a sec
[18:33:11] <thomedy> you guys are amzing
[18:35:10] <thomedy> by the way its somewhat difficult to start a freelance business iwth kids/job/other responsibilities/little time
[20:16:25] <thomedy> okay im back
[20:16:30] <thomedy> sorry lots of responsibility
[20:16:46] <robertmaxrees> you're not the only one ;)
[20:17:39] <thomedy> okay i have locked down what i think my missing part of the logic is
[20:17:45] <thomedy> if you click the link
[20:17:45] <thomedy> http://www.thinkrium.com/samples/msae_clickable/simple/
[20:17:54] <thomedy> it  is the state you load it in
[20:18:06] <thomedy> so if you load it wider then 600 px it does that version
[20:18:15] <thomedy> but if you minimize and reload < 600
[20:18:23] <thomedy> then it stays in that state
[20:18:28] <robertmaxrees> right
[20:18:41] <thomedy> however im sending in the size in the param
[20:18:45] <robertmaxrees> do you have a resize handler that destroys/reinits the handler?
[20:18:46] <thomedy> i figured that would fix it
[20:19:07] <thomedy> i thought i was good at this stuff but honestly im not sure
[20:19:15] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[20:19:17] <robertmaxrees> do you have a resize handler that destroys/reinits the handler?
[20:19:20] <thomedy> so i should un bind and rebind every time
[20:19:25] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[20:19:29] <robertmaxrees> that's terribly inefficient.
[20:19:36] <thomedy> yeah it sounds like it
[20:19:42] <robertmaxrees> but i might add in a check that adds or removes as necessary.
[20:19:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you could set a status bit and check that before running your logic.
[20:21:26] <thomedy> ut that i already do i think
[20:21:35] <robertmaxrees> share the code.
[20:21:42] <robertmaxrees> just the relevant bits.
[20:21:54] <thomedy> deal
[20:22:50] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/pWpxmKJz
[20:23:05] <thomedy> it really is just the function and the user_AGENT check
[20:24:04] <robertmaxrees> wooah.
[20:24:13] <robertmaxrees> okay, so there are some major issues in here.
[20:24:23] <robertmaxrees> so in $(window).stop().resize(function() { you call screen_anim($, window_width);
[20:24:34] <robertmaxrees> in turn, that calls io(window).on('scroll', function(e) {
[20:24:45] <robertmaxrees> this is bad - every time you resize the window, you're binding another handler to scroll.
[20:25:07] <thomedy> right im aware and i know thats bad... let me admit the mistake i made... rebinding everytime
[20:25:07] <thomedy> i know
[20:25:11] <robertmaxrees> and the resize event fires a lot when the user resizes.  that means you're running that code potentially dozens of times.
[20:25:23] <robertmaxrees> so on top of that, you never remove the listener.
[20:25:33] <robertmaxrees> and you don't check any statuses.
[20:25:40] <robertmaxrees> see the problem now?
[20:25:42] <thomedy> what about if(!is_mobile)
[20:25:54] <thomedy> is that not what your talking bout
[20:25:56] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't remove the handlers you've already bound.
[20:27:29] <thomedy> got it
[20:27:58] <thomedy> so then remove and rebind inside the if mobile and size is right?
[20:28:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:28:36] <robertmaxrees> add a status check inside the handler to see if you should run the logic or not.
[20:28:53] <robertmaxrees> basically, function screen_anim(io, size) { shouldn't exist.
[20:29:22] <robertmaxrees> you should just bind the scroll listener and see in that if you should run the logic.
[20:31:41] <thomedy> im going to google handler status
[20:31:50] <robertmaxrees> wat
[20:32:23] <thomedy> well im not sure how to add a status flag to a event.. so i think its just retun a var but im not sure
[20:32:34] <thomedy> so im googling
[20:32:51] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[20:32:53] <robertmaxrees> a variable.
[20:34:55] <thomedy> are you just saying set a bool when you start the event
[20:35:04] <thomedy> its not some object hidden natively in js
[20:35:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying you should check a condition first thing in yoru scroll handler and go from there.
[20:36:38] <robertmaxrees> if (screenIsTheRightSize) { /* my logic here */ }
[20:37:27] <thomedy> right that i already have so it makes sense that i would unbind and bind based on is_mobile and screen size
[20:37:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:37:38] <robertmaxrees> get rid of the function.
[20:37:44] <robertmaxrees> just bind the listener.
[20:37:46] <robertmaxrees> and check in there.
[20:38:01] <robertmaxrees> you can do it the other was but juggling bindings is always a pain
[21:25:26] <thomedy> okay ..
[21:26:57] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/fnZRpYdQ
[21:27:13] <thomedy> i know that in order to unbind an event or off you need the function name
[21:27:28] <thomedy> but im calling my function with arguments.... can i unbind that way
[21:28:14] <thomedy> because probably not
[21:40:58] <thomedy> okay yep im lost again
[21:41:06] <thomedy> docs say off unbind
[21:41:48] <thomedy> im binding and unbinding based on a boolean... but its not unbinding... its not even anonymous anymore
[21:55:52] <thomedy> man ... well im stumped
[22:16:53] <acidjazz> are you thtumped thomedy
[22:17:10] <acidjazz> thuffering thucotath
[22:18:19] <thomedy> acidjazz:
[22:18:22] <thomedy> omy yes
[22:18:49] <thomedy> i have a scroll event that i am binding  on a boolean conditional
[22:19:06] <thomedy> it i use the same bind on load and resize
[22:19:16] <thomedy> it unbinds on resize but after that it doesn't come back
[22:19:54] <sliterok> anyone here?
[22:19:55] <thomedy> i am i think unbinding the handler and not the default behavior of the element
[22:20:03] <thomedy> but none the less i am wrong about something
[22:20:05] <thomedy> and i dont know what
[22:21:09] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/1RCGb0iQ
[22:21:20] <sliterok> ahh. I have this code http://pastebin.com/RGPbJkvV but i everytime get "Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function" right at the start of <script>
[22:21:36] <thomedy> i dont know why my off() isn't on() again after off() takes place
[22:30:48] <albedoa> sliterok where is jquery.js in relation to the html file?
[22:31:45] <thomedy> i thought i had help... dang i gotta figure this out... whats frustrating is as a mockup its almost done...
[22:31:57] <thomedy> im stuck here because i have no idea why its not rebindig
[22:32:15] <sliterok> In /.. fix in 30 secs
[22:34:01] <thomedy> the thing is i am passing it the name of a function not an anon so it should rebind
[22:34:04] <thomedy> oooooooo
[22:34:05] <thomedy> no idea
[22:34:16] <albedoa> sliterok what?
[22:34:27] <sliterok> aldeboa: it's looks like jquery not loading... How do i check if it does?
[22:34:45] <albedoa> sliterok you open the inspector and type $
[22:35:28] <albedoa> if it returns a function you problably have jquery loaded
[22:35:41] <albedoa> if not, you should answer my question :)
[22:36:04] <sliterok> aldeboa: it returns undefined
[22:36:32] <albedoa> right
[22:36:34] <albedoa> sooooo
[22:36:38] <albedoa> maybe
[22:36:42] <albedoa> answer my question
[22:36:43] <sliterok> jquery.js is placed in  root of site. Btw im using joomla.
[22:36:53] <albedoa> no
[22:37:01] <albedoa> where is it IN RELATION to the html file
[22:37:04] <sliterok> Ah.
[22:37:13] <sliterok> ../(htmlfilehere)
[22:37:41] <albedoa> and jquery.js is at ../jquery.js ?
[22:37:53] <sliterok> Any reasons why /jquery.js should not work?
[22:37:54] <sliterok> Yes
[22:38:53] <albedoa> sliterok load the site and view the source coad
[22:38:58] <albedoa> then click the jquery.js
[22:39:12] <albedoa> what happens?
[22:39:17] <albedoa> code*
[22:40:16] <sliterok> Ah. im using chrome and it starts to edit source code of element, but if i click "open link in new tab" i get content of jquery.js
[22:40:58] <albedoa> hmm no idea
[22:41:42] <albedoa> if you can click that file and see the content
[22:41:42] <sliterok> Might it be caused by loading many versoins of jquery? Because i have joomla, loading jquery.min
[22:41:52] <albedoa> yeah that's my guess
[22:42:08] <albedoa> if the borwser can see that file it should be loading
[22:43:26] <sliterok> kinda sad. Ok, btw in to go to school, lol.
[22:43:27] <sliterok> Bye
[23:26:20] <thomedy> hello?
