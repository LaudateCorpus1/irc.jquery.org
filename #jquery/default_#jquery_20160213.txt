[00:07:05] <RonRichie> hey there, got a question please, not sure how `querySelectorAll` is different to `selectElementByTagName` ? could someone explain the difference in a few words please? thanks
[00:07:39] <rcyr> RonRichie: querySelectorAll takes CSS selectors so it's incredibly more powerful.
[00:07:57] <rcyr> Also, you probably meant getElementsByTagName
[00:08:17] <RonRichie> rcyr I read too but honestly didn't make much sense of it, what do you mean it takes CSS selectors?
[00:08:21] <RonRichie> aha, sorry that's what I meant :)
[00:08:33] <arc_> it means that you can use any selector that you would use in css
[00:08:59] <RonRichie> can I do querySelecterAll(ul > li a) ?
[00:09:03] <arc_> yes
[00:09:13] <rcyr> RonRichie: The selector is a string...
[00:09:16] <arc_> it's passed as a string though
[00:09:20] <RonRichie> ah I see, so I can not do that with TagName selector ?
[00:09:42] <rcyr> RonRichie: I'll let you find that answer.
[00:09:48] <RonRichie> rcyr well yah lol Ive never done any DOM manipulation believe it or not
[00:09:52] <rcyr> Ah
[00:10:42] <RonRichie> im all about functional programming, so just getting started with DOM traversal and stuff like that, so taking my first steps :) thanks for heads up though rcyr
[00:10:51] <rcyr> Not sure I understand why you're asking that on jQuery :/
[00:11:01] <RonRichie> rcyr aha I just realized it lol
[00:11:03] <rcyr> Also, it doesn't have anything to do with functional programming.
[00:11:23] <rcyr> The DOM is a stateful as something can get.
[00:11:46] <RonRichie> rcyr yeah that's what Im saying, it doesn't have anything to do with functional programming that's why I never got to play with it, I just said that Im into functional programming, so I didn't do any DOM manipulation
[00:12:12] <RonRichie> aha
[00:12:26] <rcyr> RonRichie: Basically... learn what the getXByWhatever functions do...
[00:12:44] <rcyr> Then forget them and use .querySelector + .querySelectorAll
[00:12:54] <rcyr> That's the only two functions you need to lookup nodes.
[00:13:14] <RonRichie> hmm lol how about getElementByClassName and ById ?
[00:13:44] <rcyr> Useless.
[00:14:01] <rcyr> The two functions I gave you do everything.
[00:14:17] <RonRichie> mdah... rcyr  how do you personally target an element with specific class name or an ID ? just wondering...
[00:14:51] <rcyr> var elem = document.getElementById('foo'); is the same as var elem = document.querySelector('#foo');
[00:15:12] <rcyr> By class? var elementsWithClass = document.querySelectorAll('.my-class');
[00:15:21] <RonRichie> oh I see, that makes sense
[00:15:34] <RonRichie> rcyr so basically no need for all these fancy selector with fancy names, just stick with these two?
[00:15:54] <rcyr> Yup, it's what I would call "modern dom"
[00:16:21] <RonRichie> I think Ive read something about querySelector being very slow compared to some other selectors or something like that
[00:16:38] <RonRichie> ah just found it again! this https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/09/28/why-is-getelementsbytagname-faster-that-queryselectorall/
[00:17:29] <rcyr> RonRichie: How often do you select nodes in your code?
[00:17:46] <rcyr> Most of the time, you'll be doing it once... at the setup phase of your code.
[00:17:59] <rcyr> It doesn't matter the slightest.
[00:18:07] <RonRichie> rcyr so I as said Im totally new to DOM stuff, so Ive never selected any of them lol but if you are saying so, Im pretty sure you know something
[02:50:34] <rails690> I have a large form with around 140 inputs. It's causing big performance problems. If I use .show() for 40 inputs and .hide() for 100 inputs, does this solve the performance problem or make no difference?
[03:05:20] <rails690> I have a large form with around 140 inputs. It's causing big performance problems. If I use .show() for 40 inputs and .hide() for 100 inputs, does this solve the performance problem or make no difference?
[04:06:19] <estodiMania> I am using clone to duplicate the last row of a table including the inputs. But i need to clear all the inputs beside  one hidden input. The hidden input needs to get a + 1. So the value of the hidden input is now 12 when i click on the clone button it needs to be 13 and all other  input fields need to be cleared.
[05:53:11] <semur> is there an easy way to replace all attribute values? something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/btg0bL8f/1/
[05:54:15] <semur> i also can't seem to get jquery to work with jsfiddle, i've tried changing the load type but to no avail
[05:54:26] <BustyLoliChan> I am loading a page into a div.... this page has a script in it which, once loaded into the page, then calls 'someurl' is there a way to catch that 'someurl' and change it to 'somedifferenturl' ?
[06:00:38] <semur> my code had some bugs, try this one instead: https://jsfiddle.net/btg0bL8f/3/
[06:28:58] <worknick> hi
[06:29:16] <worknick> whats the recommended way to replace Follow button with Unfollow button on click of follow and vice versa?
[07:26:20] <BustyLoliChan> http://pastebin.com/wjF3S2hu I notice autoplay: JSON.parse("false"); is there a way to set this to true from an external domain outside of this iframe?
[09:05:13] <gutu3> hi. i tried to remove an advertisement on a web-page with jquery (greasemonkey), after that the page goes in "lazy-mode" and can not load all images and scripts. is the removing in jquery so slow or what is the problem?
[09:45:40] <herewego> What do I have to do, to replicate this completely, on another server? https://github.com/TCotton/portfolio  it's an angular js ap. used on www.andywalpole.me   and i'm trying to use the github to replicate it, but am clueless as to how to then...do i set up node.js for this, do I have to set up a mongodb?
[09:46:41] <taplar> maybe try #angularjs
[10:33:51] <worknick> how can i access input field of specific form? there are more than one form. can i do $(this 'input[name]')
[10:34:53] <taplar> if 'this' is the form dom element then $(this).find('input[name=""]')
[10:35:27] <worknick> taplar: find? i want to change that input value?
[10:35:45] <taplar> you can change it after you find it.  you have to get the reference before you can modify it
[10:48:08] <worknick> taplar: ok
[10:48:09] <worknick> thanks
[10:54:43] <BPL> Hi everybody
[10:54:53] <BPL> I got a question, I'm using jquery+jquery-ui (browserified) on nodejs... i'd like to know how to inject the jquery-ui's  themes/styles into my html files
[11:05:34] <aro> is it possible to send a callback from an iframe once a form submission is complete?
[11:05:51] <aro> or detect a url change
[11:05:55] <shoky_> BPL browserify doesn't help you with css i think. you can include the css file explicitly in your html.  there's other solutions like webpack that also do the css stuff i think, but i donno much bout that
[11:06:02] <taplar> the iframe should have a load event that it fires
[11:06:32] <BPL> shoky_, my use case is next, I'm using gulp+browserify+watchify ... i'm trying to find something suitable for such a workflow
[11:07:00] <BPL> shoky_ , maybe something like this, https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify-css , dunno... gonna try
[11:07:30] <shoky_> BPL: i donno gulp/watchify/browserify-css so can't help you bout those.. but mm explicitly including the css file in your html ain't so bad imo
[11:07:38] <shoky_> that's what i'm currently doing
[11:10:00] <BPL> shoky_ , i understand, of course that approach isn't bad, it's worked for years... although i'd prefer having all my logic/ui settings into my src folder, i'd like the html be as dummy as possible
[11:12:13] <shoky_> BPL welp then maybe you should checkout webpack, donno
[11:22:16] <aro> is there a way using deferred and stuff to basically intercept a form submit, and allow to continue after a condition is met?
[11:23:23] <shoky_> aro: not with deferred's.  you can listen for a form's submit event, and call .preventDefault() on the event argument if you want to prevent the submit.
[11:23:55] <aro> i want to basically on submit, fire another event, whne that event is complete, resume form submit
[11:23:57] <aro> is that possible
[11:23:58] <shoky_> aro: and if you want later to trigger a submit from code, you can call .submit() on the raw dom element of the form (not the jquery object)
[11:24:09] <shoky_> yes
[11:24:14] <aro> how
[11:24:21] <aro> i just want to resume the same submit
[11:24:22] <shoky_> like i just explained
[11:24:41] <shoky_> uhm. it'll submit whatever the form has at the time its actually submitted
[11:24:56] <aro> how? is it a second submit?
[11:25:11] <aro> if that is the case, i would get stuck in an infinite loop
[11:25:21] <shoky_> like i said, you call .submit() on the raw form element , not on the jquery object
[11:25:28] <shoky_> so it doesn't trigger a submit event
[11:25:32] <shoky_> just submits the form.
[11:26:12] <aro> how do i do it on raw form element?
[11:26:18] <aro> getElementById()?
[11:26:41] <taplar> get() or get(0) or [0] will break out of the jquery object
[11:26:42] <shoky_> you can get it with [0]  on the jquery object for example.
[11:26:54] <shoky_> e.g. var form = $('#myform');   ..  form[0].submit()
[11:26:56] <aro> ok
[11:27:01] <aro> uh
[11:27:10] <aro> so get(0).form[0].submit()
[11:27:15] <shoky_> no
[11:27:17] <shoky_> just what i said
[11:27:33] <shoky_> .get(0)  is the same as [0]
[11:27:34] <aro> ok
[11:27:50] <shoky_> (it get's the first element in the jquery colletion)
[11:28:08] <shoky_> gets* collection*
[12:21:38] <aro> if i trigger submit of a form, will the on('submit') handler be invoiked
[12:22:11] <shoky_> aro: if you call .submit() on the jquery object containing the form, then yes.  if you call .submit() on the raw dom element, then no.
[12:25:58] <aro> ok
[12:35:54] <wCPO> I don't understand why ifModfied with jquery.ajax does not work. http://dpaste.com/1XPM7DD any idea?
[12:58:13] <wCPO> It seems like IfModifed does not work with HEAD request..
[13:19:02] <estodiMania> Hello, I have a strange problem. I am using jQuery to retrieve data from the database with ajax. The strange thing is that sometimes i get a result when i click and sometimes the return is empty.
[13:19:16] <estodiMania> Anyone an idea what it could be ?
[13:19:28] <taplar> are you trying to access the results in the success callback?
[13:19:33] <estodiMania> yes
[13:19:58] <taplar> and you verified that the endpoint is always returning a result?
[13:21:11] <estodiMania> Yes, when i call the PHP file in the browser i see the json data
[13:21:26] <taplar> throw what your trying in a fiddle
[13:22:07] <estodiMania> ok 1 sec
[13:24:29] <estodiMania> https://jsfiddle.net/hs8fuez2/
[13:25:12] <taplar> so your saying datatest on ln 12 doesn't always have a value?
[13:25:25] <estodiMania> Yeah
[13:25:29] <estodiMania> sometimes
[13:25:40] <taplar> yeah so that would signify the backend didn't return anything
[13:25:40] <estodiMania> but when i look at the PHP file i see the json data all the time
[13:26:08] <taplar> uh, not sure what you mean there
[13:26:23] <taplar> but you can look at your network tab and see the response to your requests
[13:26:38] <taplar> which is what i was saying before about verifying the response
[13:27:04] <estodiMania> aha ok, what i meant is when i look at the file get_times.php in my browser i see the json data
[13:27:13] <taplar> also you have dataType: 'json' so if you ever don't return json it will throw the error handler instead
[13:27:23] <estodiMania> because i echo json_encode()
[13:29:39] <estodiMania> sometimes i have a response and sometimes not
[13:29:47] <estodiMania> really strange
[13:30:03] <estodiMania> sometimes is this the response: []
[13:30:11] <estodiMania> and sometimes json
[13:30:22] <taplar> [] is json, technically
[13:30:48] <estodiMania> yes
[13:30:50] <taplar> but anway, so yeah, it's a backend issue
[13:31:02] <estodiMania> ok you mean the php file?
[13:31:16] <taplar> includes/get_times.php
[13:31:22] <estodiMania> yes
[13:31:33] <estodiMania> ok thank you
[13:31:41] <estodiMania> so it is not something with jquery
[13:31:48] <taplar> nope
[13:32:19] <estodiMania> can i upload php on fiddle?
[13:32:39] <taplar> sure, it just won't run
[13:33:02] <taplar> if by 'upload' you mean copy and paste the file
[13:33:10] <estodiMania> https://jsfiddle.net/hs8fuez2/
[13:33:13] <estodiMania> yeah copy paste
[13:33:18] <estodiMania> i pasted in the html
[13:33:24] <estodiMania> it is very simple php
[13:33:26] <taplar> gotta hit update
[13:33:51] <estodiMania> done :)
[13:35:36] <taplar> you could try error_log the $output and see what the results are
[13:35:54] <taplar> also this is kinda off topic for the channel.  you might try ##php
[13:39:15] <estodiMania> yes i tried it
[13:39:18] <estodiMania> no errors
[13:40:08] <taplar> so did you see it only sometimes populating the $output?
[13:40:55] <estodiMania> it is always populating $output
[13:41:02] <estodiMania> i did refresh many times
[13:42:26] <taplar> not sure then, if it's always populating $output then you should have seen the request in the network tab always with the response
[13:42:37] <estodiMania> yes
[13:43:11] <estodiMania> sometimes it only return one object, sometimes two and sometimes none
[13:43:56] <taplar> but the $output always has two?
[13:44:35] <estodiMania> solved it
[13:44:42] <estodiMania> i think i know what the problem is
[13:44:57] <estodiMania> i have two ajax calls on the same onclick
[13:45:02] <taplar> :|
[13:45:07] <estodiMania> i removed one and not it is working
[13:45:23] <estodiMania> but i need two ajax calls on that same button
[13:45:28] <estodiMania> hmm need to fix that
[13:45:38] <estodiMania> not = now
[13:45:41] <taplar> why not do the second call from the first's success callback?
[13:46:04] <estodiMania> good idea
[13:46:13] <taplar> kinda how ajax works, :)
[13:46:49] <taplar> then you can remove the async: false
[13:47:02] <taplar> which you should always try to avoid
[13:47:22] <estodiMania> i am new to ajax :)
[13:47:25] <estodiMania> thanks !!
[13:47:28] <estodiMania> works great now
[13:47:45] <taplar> sure, one more thing.  that php script, was that just a mock up or is that what your going with in production?
[13:48:20] <estodiMania> no mockup
[13:48:26] <taplar> because this is a bad idea:
[13:48:26] <estodiMania> i know sql injections you mean?
[13:48:28] <taplar> $getTotalTaskMinutes = "SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE projectid = $project_id";
[13:48:31] <taplar> yeah
[13:48:33] <taplar> exactly
[13:48:34] <estodiMania> yes i know
[13:48:41] <estodiMania> was just a mockup to test ajax
[13:48:46] <taplar> good deal
[13:48:58] <estodiMania> thanks !
[13:49:03] <taplar> np
[13:51:03] <YamakasY> win 31

[17:40:15] <shoky_> $('form').find(':input')
[17:42:18] <noregret> shoky_: can i iterate that with $.each ?
[17:42:58] <shoky_> noregret: you can iterate with .each yea  $('form').find(':input').each(...)
