[00:00:15] <doug65536> it's unforunate that browsers have that idiotic behavior - // pointing to the filesystem root in a local web page. as if that is ever what you would want
[01:36:07] <LoveitSoMuch> Hey, this might not be the right place to ask it. but maybe somebody knows. Is it possible to fetch text from a google doc and use it for like changing text on a website? So lets say i have a welcome message in a google doc. can it be displayed on a webpage and then be changed when the doc changes? or is this just horrible idea haha
[01:37:38] <LoveitSoMuch> i did some searches before asking this btw. but got a little bit confused by the results.
[01:38:44] <JackJones> good morning, some could tell me, how i could write this parameters for both function in on variable, or array or watherever ? http://pastebin.ca/2456598
[01:46:09] <_rgn> JackJones: https://gist.github.com/raneksi/f725e0ae865b453b39c0
[01:47:07] <JackJones> _rgn: thank you, is this var opts, a array or a json string ?
[01:47:24] <ph88> LoveitSoMuch: maybe google has an api for it
[01:47:26] <_rgn> neither..
[01:48:00] <LoveitSoMuch> yeh im reading this: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/documents-list/
[01:48:58] <JackJones> _rgn: ?
[01:49:31] <JackJones> what you mean ?
[01:49:44] <_rgn> it's an object
[01:51:07] <_rgn> http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/#object.general
[01:51:56] <JackJones> thank you
[01:55:33] <_rgn> json would be a way to represent (serialize) that object as a string. JSON.stringify(opts)
[02:16:56] <JackJones> someone could help me with the onChange handler to the checkbox ? http://pastebin.ca/2456611
[02:24:33] <ciurkut> hiho dumb question... why $("#f2").click(alert("smth")); fires after load without clicking O.o
[02:28:22] <lxsameer> hey guys, how can i animate adding and removing a class to an element
[02:45:27] <doug65536> ciurkut: because you pass a callback to click. you care calling alert and passing its (undefined) return value to click
[02:45:58] <doug65536> ciurkut:  $("#f2").click(function() { alert("smth"); });
[02:46:23] <doug65536> s/care/are/
[02:46:54] <doug65536> lxsameer: with css transitions
[02:47:46] <doug65536> jack's gone :(
[02:48:19] <doug65536> Dragooon: jump
[02:48:43] * Dragooon jumps
[02:48:59] <doug65536> thanks :)
[02:49:16] <Dragooon> :D
[03:02:09] <ciurkut> thx doug
[04:36:39] <bonhoeffer> i'm confused. where is the javascript that initializes the tabs on this page: http://tiensoon.com/demo/bootstrap/tabs.html
[04:37:29] <bonhoeffer> there is just jquery and this: http://tiensoon.com/demo/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js
[04:37:42] <bonhoeffer> neither of which have a $(#foo).tabs() function
[05:10:20] <_rgn> bonhoeffer: there isn't any
[05:10:46] <bonhoeffer> so how does it work?
[05:10:47] <_rgn> read the markup section http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs
[05:11:17] <bonhoeffer> yeah -- so the js searches for the class and adds the js functionality
[05:11:31] <_rgn> no you didn't read it
[05:11:39] <bonhoeffer> wow --- thanks for that link!!
[05:28:42] <bonhoeffer> _rgn: so you mean You can activate a tab or pill navigation without writing any JavaScript by simply specifying data-toggle="tab" o
[05:29:18] <_rgn> is that what the page says
[05:32:38] <bonhoeffer> yep!
[05:33:30] <_rgn> then that's probably the case
[05:33:46] <Thoams> mmm, data attributes.
[05:33:48] <_rgn> s/probably//
[05:46:28] <n3w> hi there, i got this http://pastebin.com/NvVNW01a simple function, but dunno why, it wont run on each element separately, it makesc all my spans got same value, what can be wrong here ?
[05:51:42] <Thoams> it's doing exactly what you're telling it to
[05:52:12] <Thoams> every span with the class 'time_remain' begins counting down at (very very bloody nearly) the same time
[05:52:43] <n3w> yes, but @ start they got diffrent values, and i want it count down from this values, but it makes all span values same
[05:53:37] <n3w> so i need this function run separetly for each one
[06:38:07] <danialr> how can i retrieve html data in tag like <div data-mydata="something" > using jquery ?
[06:39:08] <snoop> I am not sure I understand what you mean
[06:41:07] <danialr> i have this <button data-msg-id="'+msg.id+'" id="my-close" class="close" type="button">  i want to get the value of data-msg-id with jquery
[06:41:10] <danialr> snoop: ^
[06:42:36] <joko-wandiro> promote my new plugin for WP Community https://github.com/joko-wandiro/phc-s-gallery-responsive. I create WP version from Jquery Plugin S Gallery Responsive so everyone can use it on WordPress
[06:43:54] <snoop> alright
[06:44:50] <snoop> well you can do this by getting the attribute of tag button
[06:45:25] <snoop> use something like $('button').attr('data-msg-id')
[06:45:27] <danialr> you mean $('button[id=my-close]').attribute ?
[06:45:33] <danialr> aha
[06:47:15] <danialr> thanks solved
[06:47:31] <snoop> danialr do you know any good php channel?
[06:47:36] <snoop> no problem
[06:47:55] <danialr> snoop: /join ##php
[06:48:27] <snoop> I have tried thsi but it doesn't connect me
[06:48:35] <snoop> I am new to irc
[06:49:03] <boytoy> snoop: u prolly need to reg ur nick
[06:49:07] <danialr> snoop: what do you mean ?
[06:49:26] <boytoy> snoop: /msg nickserv what up my neezle
[06:49:42] <danialr> snoop: type this /msg nickserv register <your pass> <your email>
[06:49:46] <danialr> then go to your email
[06:49:57] <boytoy> yeah
[06:50:02] <snoop> where do i type this?
[06:50:08] <danialr> and copy paste the code sent to you
[06:50:09] <boytoy> then open your email
[06:50:13] <danialr> here without any space
[06:50:15] <boytoy> and dont forget to read it too =)
[06:50:25] <snoop> heheheh cool
[06:50:30] <snoop> let me try
[06:50:33] <danialr> run that code here to
[06:50:39] <danialr> too
[06:51:01] <danialr> then use this /msg nickserv identify <your password>
[06:51:07] <danialr> after you can use php channel
[06:51:28] <snoop> ok let me give it a go and let you know if i run into any issue
[06:51:36] <danialr> ok
[06:52:43] <snoop>  /msgnickservregister
[06:53:06] <snoop>  /msg nicks ervregister
[06:53:35] <snoop>  /msg nick serv register
[06:54:00] <danialr>  /msg nickserv register <pass> <email>
[06:54:17] <danialr> just copy paste it
[06:54:44] <snoop>  /msg nickserv register <snoop> <iman_geo@yahoo.com>
[06:55:17] <danialr> without space
[06:55:24] <danialr> first space
[06:55:58] <snoop> do i need to type my pass and email?
[06:56:20] <Zarthus> Your own, yes, it is also recommended without telling anyone else
[06:56:26] <danialr> yes for identify and email for send activation
[06:56:36] <snoop> alright
[06:56:52] <Zarthus> It will look like this:
[06:56:52] <Zarthus> /msg nickserv myPassword myEmail@email.com
[06:57:42] <snoop> it says I can't use my nickname?
[06:57:49] <Zarthus> You're using your nickname as password
[06:57:58] <Zarthus> You can't do that because it is too insecure.
[06:58:12] <Zarthus> Consider using a stronger password that is easy to remember yet hard to guess
[06:58:23] <snoop> go it
[06:58:41] <snoop> it says snoop is already registered now
[06:58:52] <snoop> do I have to go to my email now?
[06:58:54] <danialr> so go to email and run the code sent to u
[06:58:59] <snoop> ok
[06:59:03] <danialr> then identify
[06:59:44] <Zarthus> snoop: The account `snoop` is already registered by someone else
[06:59:50] <Zarthus> You have to use a different nickname
[06:59:56] <Zarthus> Although!
[07:00:03] <Zarthus> You can go over to #freenode and request the nickname to be removed
[07:01:01] <snoop> how can I rquest to remove nickname?
[07:01:29] <Zarthus> Go to #freenode, and say in that channel you'd like the nickname to be dropped
[07:01:31] <Zarthus> so you can use it
[07:02:16] <Zarthus> #freenode is also usually your go-to channel when you need support with IRC, rather than #jQuery
[07:05:17] <snoop> when you say go to #freenode what do you mean exactlly? how do I navigate to that?
[07:05:38] <Zarthus> snoop: /joiN #freenode
[07:05:54] <snoop> ok
[07:08:47] <Zarthus> snoop: er\ry just dropped the name you wanted to register, you can register it freely now.
[07:09:08] <Zarthus> After that, verify via your email and you should be set.
[07:10:21] <snoop> awsome it worked thanks guys
[07:10:23] <snoop> ;)
[07:12:56] <Zarthus> No worries, keep in mind #freenode is your go-to channel for irc support
[07:15:07] <snoop> sure thing
[07:20:38] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/TS5ny/ -- I got jQuery Embedly autoembedding YouTube URLs into nicely treated media snippets. But when users enter YouTube's actual embed code, Embedly doesn't know what to do. Is there a way to prevent this?
[07:22:28] <boytoy> Maybe listen in on the user typing, and if she starts typing iframes and stuff, tell her to please just enter the normal URL?
[07:26:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How come underscore.js does not support any methods to push, edit, delete items in an array or object?
[07:34:51] <_rgn> what do you want to do
[07:42:43] <zmode> hello. i have a small $.get() that fetches a <table> from the server. i'm trying to get that table's ID, but .attr() says it's undefined. http://sprunge.us/IheY i can however see the ID in the first console.log() under context->id (in the firefox logger)
[07:43:21] <crazydiamond> Hi. Can anyone tell what's "jquery-1.10.2.min.map" file?
[07:45:12] <snoop> i think its showin you undefined as it might be reading the first table that it finds
[07:45:22] <snoop> you might want to loop over it
[07:46:59] <zmode> snoop: all the server returns is <table id="someID">[...]</table> . if i try this_table[0] i get "undefined" even when logging "this_table"
[07:47:49] <snoop> then how are you trying to get the attr?
[07:48:09] <zmode> snoop: on "this_table", not "this_table[0]"
[07:49:03] <zmode> snoop: the first console.log(this_table) in the link looks like this in firefox: http://i.imgur.com/1jHW9Mr.png
[07:49:21] <zmode> so that's /one/ object, the table, right?
[07:50:40] <snoop> does this table has a parent?
[07:50:45] <snoop> like a div span or something?
[07:51:44] <zmode> snoop: no. it is appended to a <span> in the second line, but the object i'm working on is just the data from the server, not the full page
[07:52:01] <snoop> ok
[07:52:32] <snoop> this_table what did you set it as?
[07:54:05] <zmode> snoop: i'm not sure what you asked. this_table is the HTMLTableElement
[07:54:33] <snoop> so var this_table = $('table'); right
[07:55:28] <snoop> so when you say $(this_table).attr('id') it returns undefined?
[07:55:36] <zmode> snoop: yes. this works: http://sprunge.us/TefX
[07:56:08] <zmode> snoop: elements[2] was the actual table and i was getting '[id^="table"]' from inside that table. or something.
[07:56:58] <eitama> Hello, I'm trying to select a specific element by it's attribute called "data-tooltip", I want to search inside some toolbar, which I can see in chrome's inspect element. I can't understand which query selector I should be using. Can anyone help me please?
[07:57:57] <eitama> In other words, Instead of doing : $("div[data-tooltip="someString"]) - I want to narrow it down to a deeper level div to save time and improve performance. How do I search inside a div and not all the document?
[07:58:23] <eitama> I'd appreciate any help on this as Iv'e been trying this for about 8 hours now.
[08:01:16] <snoop> zmode: so it works now
[08:02:17] <zmode> snoop: yup.
[08:04:59] <snoop> I am off now guys hav fun catch you soon
[08:06:11] <zmode> snoop: take care, thanks for your time
[08:11:50] <sunbeam> if a <p></p> only contains just 1 <a> how can I remove the <p> around this <a> ?
[08:13:32] <youf> you can do $("<p>..</p>").find("a")
[08:15:04] <youf> or maybe even this $("<p>...<p>").children().get(0)
[08:15:12] <sunbeam> yes,
[08:15:18] <sunbeam> but how to remove the <p> around it?
[08:15:53] <youf> or you mean you want to tranform all <p><a>..</a></p>  into simple <a>..</a> ?
[08:15:58] <sunbeam> Yep!
[08:16:13] <youf> or then you can do this
[08:18:12] <youf> $("p").each(function(){ var content = $(this).find(a).html(); $(this).replaceWith(content)   });
[08:19:07] <sunbeam> thanks
[08:19:08] <sunbeam> sec
[08:19:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a select box that is added to the dom with jquery... The existing select boxes all have an onchange handler which works (selected by class) - but for the newly added select boxes, the onchange is not caught... Is it possible to do this?
[08:20:01] <sunbeam> youf: i think i need an if() its the only content
[08:20:13] <sunbeam> youf: this will simply do this to every <p>
[08:20:17] <sunbeam> with at least 1 <a>
[08:21:15] <youf> ok, there was a mistake in my previous code
[08:21:17] <youf> fixed it here
[08:21:18] <youf> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KjHvy
[08:22:02] <sunbeam> thanks
[08:24:16] <youf> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KjHvy
[08:24:34] <youf> you can see how the paragraph is removed as you erase the doIt() call
[09:35:11] <thumbtackthief> I'm using the FancyBox modal to pop up a comment submission form.  I almost have it working; right now, if a field is left blank the error message correctly pops up, but then the box immediately closes.  I don't know why.  https://dpaste.de/wDVi9/
[09:36:16] <Ziber> When binding to .on('click', '#something', function() { }), can I incorporate .toggle() somehow?
[09:36:59] <diphtherial> thumbtackthief: not too familiar with fancybox, reading up on it now
[09:37:36] <thumbtackthief> @diphtherial Thanks--I used tip #5 as a model:  http://fancybox.net/blog
[09:37:43] <diphtherial> Ziber: if you're asking whether you can have multiple click handlers associated with an element, yes, you can
[09:38:08] <Ziber> diphtherial: I want to toggle between them, much like .toggle(), but using a parent element instead.
[09:38:55] <Ziber> Or, rather, to achieve the same thing, can I test whether a CSS class is applied to an element?
[09:39:29] <Ziber> ah .hasClass()
[09:39:33] <diphtherial> sure, there's the .hasClass() method, as well as a pseudo-selector for it (i think it's ':is')
[09:39:33] * Ziber scurries away
[09:39:35] <diphtherial> ah, heh, yes
[09:39:43] <Ziber> :)
[09:46:41] <diphtherial> thumbtackthief: i'm having similar issues with their example, http://jsfiddle.net/LXsYM/
[09:47:02] <diphtherial> it seems that the form submission isn't being cancelled, despite that being what's supposed to happen when you return false from the form submission handler
[09:47:28] <thumbtackthief> I'm getting a csrf on your middle, @diphtherial
[09:47:43] <thumbtackthief> *fiddle
[09:48:00] <diphtherial> when you attempt to log in, you mean?
[09:48:14] <diphtherial> er, "log in" as in press the button in the form that says 'log in'
[09:48:18] <thumbtackthief> Yes
[09:48:45] <thumbtackthief> I had to add a document.ready handler on mine to get it to work at all, fwiw
[09:48:52] <diphtherial> right, i'm not surprised that jsfiddle has issues with random form submissions, but the point i was attempting to make is that it's passing the submission along to the server rather than blocking at the client level
[09:49:03] <diphtherial> right, there's an implicit one here; jsfiddle adds it for you
[09:51:25] <thumbtackthief> Ok...
[09:51:33] <thumbtackthief> (fairly new to all this!)
[09:51:53] <diphtherial> heh, same :) apologies that that wasn't immediately helpful; i was just trying to demonstrate that i'm having the same problem
[09:51:58] <diphtherial> i think i'm close to figuring it out, though
[09:52:08] <thumbtackthief> No worries--as long as I'm learning, I'm happy.  ;)
[10:00:02] <[E]sc> for some reason my jquery script suddenly stopped sending ajax variables to my php.  It'll execute the php file, but the variables aren't set.  they are having getting set before the url is called.  any suggestions?
[10:09:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If you do an ajax call to retrieve JSON data from a file, in the success callback, how can you put that returndata to a JS variable?
[10:12:56] <ph88> ecky--ptang-zoob:    var variable = data;
[10:13:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $.ajax({ dataType: "json",  url : url_initialdata,     success : function (initdata) { alldata = initdata; } });
[10:13:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> then I do console.log(alldata) and it says undefined
[10:13:51] <ph88> put console $.ajax({ dataType: "json",  url : url_initialdata,     success : function (initdata) { alldata = initdata; console.log(alldata); } });
[10:13:52] <ph88> try that
[10:14:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> That logs the data...
[10:14:31] <ph88> nice :)
[10:14:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and alldata is defined on top of the js file
[10:14:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so it should be accessible anywhere right?
[10:14:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> var alldata;
[10:14:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> first line of js file
[10:14:58] <ph88> very good
[10:16:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so why is it undefined when I log alldata outside the success function?
[10:16:37] <ph88> cuz the data is not available yet
[10:16:49] <ph88> it's asynchronous
[10:17:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> w0t?
[10:17:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's available when i log it inside the success function
[10:17:38] <ph88> when you log it outside of the function ... at the time of the logging the server has not send data back yet
[10:17:47] <ph88> inside the function happens later
[10:18:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[10:18:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but I need it globally...
[10:18:25] <ph88> it will be globally ... but later in time
[10:18:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Where do I need to retrieve it ?
[10:18:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> because I need to loop through that content
[10:18:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and it's undefined
[10:19:00] <ph88> your loop should not start until callback success
[10:19:13] <ph88> so from your callback function you can start your loop
[10:19:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that whole loop in the success function?
[10:19:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that's not ideal, it's very long
[10:19:44] <ph88> you can put that loop in it's own function
[10:19:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can't I load all JSON files upfront?
[10:19:54] <ph88> then call that function from the callback function
[10:20:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[10:20:11] <ph88> of course you can load it upfront ... but then it wouldn't be ajax anymore ^^
[10:20:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Well it's static data
[10:20:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How do I read it upfront?
[10:21:42] <ph88> load it with the page normally ... from the server ... put the json in a variable between html script tag
[10:21:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[10:22:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $.getJSON("test.json" - that's also async?
[10:22:42] <ph88> i don't know
[10:23:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I could set 'async':false; no?
[10:23:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> or is that unethical
[10:23:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[10:23:50] <diphtherial> it defeats the purpose of using ajax, which is to 'asynchronously' load things without blocking your page
[10:24:06] <diphtherial> if you make it synchronous, your page will appear to freeze during the download
[10:24:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but all page data comes from the json, so there is no page without those files
[10:24:35] <diphtherial> sure, so display some kind of splash div that covers the document with a loading animation, then dismiss it when the data arrives
[10:24:42] <diphtherial> better than freezing the user's browser
[10:24:56] <diphtherial> or better yet, use this: http://www.malsup.com/jquery/block/
[10:25:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok tx
[10:49:37] <Ashley`> hi :s
[10:50:03] <diphtherial> hello :3
[10:52:16] <Ashley`> http://ashley.re/nowplaying/parallax.js <- could you please review this code?
[10:52:37] <Ashley`> (my first plugin, used at http://ashley.re/nowplaying/)
[10:55:16] <rmurphey> Ashley`: let your minifier strip out whitespace etc ... this is very difficult to read as written
[10:55:31] <rmurphey> use whitespace liberally and use variable names that are human-readable
[10:55:48] <rmurphey> also all of your variables are global, because they are not declared using var
[10:56:29] <Ashley`> thanks
[10:57:12] <rmurphey> also you are probably going to want to be very careful how much you are trying to do on mousemove
[10:57:23] <rmurphey> could get slow in a hurry
[10:57:55] <ravenzz> I am not sure that it is a good idea to cache into the window obj
[11:00:03] <dkphenom> anyone know a slider that's implemented here: http://www.wistar.org/? looking for very similar type of functionality, 3 panel slider with sneak peak of previous and next images
[11:00:39] <Ashley`> oh
[11:00:41] <Ashley`>  40         bar=bar/2;
[11:00:43] <Ashley`>  41         bar*=2;
[11:00:45] <Ashley`> genius :D
[11:01:36] <ravenzz> dkphenom flexslider maybe?
[11:02:49] <dkphenom> @ravenzz, how do you get next/prev image peaking like that?
[11:04:04] <ravenzz> uhm maybe you can change the slide width and center it
[11:05:03] <dkphenom> don't think it's flexslider
[11:05:21] <Ashley`> hm... i have an idea
[11:08:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> functionlist.find("option").filter(":selected").attr("selected", "selected"); why does this not work?
[11:11:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Or this: functionlist.find("option[value='selectedfunctioncodeid']").attr("selected", "selected");
[11:14:05] <ph88> ecky--ptang-zoob: jsfiddle it :)
[11:14:56] <diphtherial> out of curiosity, are most people using jquery 2.x these days? i'm still on 1.x
[11:15:28] <rmurphey> diphtherial: i can say that almost certainly most people are still using 1.x
[11:15:50] <rmurphey> there are plenty of sites still using 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 ...
[11:16:20] <diphtherial> ah, thanks. i'm mostly curious if the improvements were worth switching over
[11:16:40] <rmurphey> amazon.com is still using their own special version of 1.2.6
[11:16:49] <rmurphey> diphtherial: do you need to support old ie?
[11:17:04] <rmurphey> and do you use a lot of third-party plugins?
[11:17:36] <diphtherial> i don't need to support IE, no, and i don't use very many third-party plugins
[11:17:45] <rmurphey> then i'd say try it and see :)
[11:18:01] <diphtherial> sounds good, then :) i'm reading the 2.0 release notes right now as well
[11:29:23] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/CnREt/1/ -- how do I give the span the height and width of its parent element?
[11:30:10] <boytoy> I thought css('width', main.width()) would work but =/
[11:32:50] <boytoy> Or css('width', parent().width()) but nah!
[11:40:43] <boytoy> ah my bad.. wasnt allowed to newline like that :p
[11:57:44] <guest_____> Hi i am looking to loop through a object with jquery or pure javascript. ex: var items{};   items[itemNum] = {'sku': skuNum, 'price': priceInput}; then I want to output just the sku property of all items{} object?
[11:59:11] <guest_____> I have tried a for loop but dont think I am doing it right so if someone could tell me what to do that would be awesome!
[12:00:27] <_rgn> for (var key in items) { console.log(items[key].sku); }
[12:01:02] <guest_____> thanks I will try that
[12:01:40] <Velveeta> you should also do a check for if (items.hasOwnProperty(key))
[12:02:07] <_rgn> guess so
[12:02:22] <Velveeta> in this context it's not gonna actually mean much, but it's good practice
[12:03:37] <guest_____> What does it do?
[12:05:01] <_rgn> i think it's used in case your object inherits properties (from its prototype or something)
[12:05:23] <guest_____> ok
[12:07:53] <guest_____> yeah it worked!!! thanks
[12:25:32] <platzhirsch> Any suggestions for a good slider in JS?
[12:27:12] <boytoy> platzhirsch: slip 'n slide
[12:27:32] <boytoy> err
[12:27:37] <boytoy> platzhirsch: http://swipejs.com/
[12:27:47] <platzhirsch> boytoy: thanks ;)
[12:27:54] <platzhirsch> I was a bit startled when I searched for it
[12:28:04] <boytoy> hehe =)
[12:28:18] <platzhirsch> Swipe JS looks awesome, but I meant a slider controller
[12:28:25] <platzhirsch> like http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-slider/
[12:41:34] <platzhirsch> The native sliders by input type range look fine

[13:58:35] <mysteronyx> How would you override an HTML form submit with AJAX? Would seem like I need to disable the form submit button, but that's what I want to use to trigger the AJA.
[13:58:47] <mysteronyx> AJAX*
[14:00:38] <Max-P> Hi, I have a problem with draggables and droppables and I don't even know what to search for. Basically, I have a long list of draggables in a <div overflow: auto>. These are also droppables, so people can merge them together. I also have droppables outside of this scrollable div. Both works fine, but dropping on the outside droppables also triggers the droppables inside the scrolling div (probably something with the calculated positions inside the div). Wher
[14:00:38] <Max-P> e should I look to fix that?
[14:01:29] <mysteronyx> I suppose I can just do preventDefault
[14:02:39] <Max-P> mysteronyx, Yeah, preventDefault or return false is the way to do it. It's how you tell the browser you handled it yourself.
[14:02:46] <mysteronyx> ok thanks
[14:03:00] <grafi> slick- dodoo?

[14:03:27] <slick-> two frameworks?
[14:03:29] <HarryPitfall> return false is stopPropagation() + preventDefault()

[14:04:54] <HenryCH> hi guys, looking for some help creating a link on a page that will do nothing but execute a javascript function and be able to pass it some values, I've had a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1265887/call-javascript-function-on-hyperlink-click   but it doesn't seem that this will allow me to pass stuff to the function, any ideas?
[14:05:02] <grafi> ups sorry :P
[14:05:04] <grafi> wrong channel
[14:05:44] <HarryPitfall> if you need to have extra information, my sugestion is use data-attributes, and read then on the function - $(this).data('attribute')
[14:06:04] <HenryCH> data attributes in the <a>?
[14:06:15] <HarryPitfall> yes
[14:06:39] <HarryPitfall> <a href="#" data-opt1="some value">... and in the event, $(this).data('opt1')
[14:06:41] <HenryCH> Could I use that in a button as well?
[14:06:52] <Max-P> HenryCH, Where does the data comes from? If the data comes from the page, use the data-attributes <a ... data-mystuff="anything you want here">. If you are binding the event in the JS, you can just pass the local variables in the closure
[14:08:02] <HenryCH> the table is compiled from a database and echoed to html
[14:08:21] <HenryCH> so I guess I can just add what HarryPitfall suggested
[14:08:59] <HarryPitfall> I use data attributes for 2 reasons, is html5 compliant and jQuery have .data()
[14:09:16] <HarryPitfall> if you need to change later, you use .data to 'replace' the value
[14:10:29] <HenryCH> Got it, thanks :P

[14:49:17] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/nRnre/1/ -- why am I getting 0 for $(elem).width()? Isn't it supposed to be 300?
[14:51:27] <BillCriswell> boytoy: You can't get the width till it's in the document. http://jsfiddle.net/nRnre/2/
[14:54:10] <boytoy> BillCriswell: oh right.. hmm..
[14:55:19] <boytoy> BillCriswell: btw managed to come across a fancy intro the other day: http://jsfiddle.net/desandro/Qd67z/5/
[14:55:53] <boytoy> its on my todo to come up with an alternative more like the example you showed me though
[14:56:03] <BillCriswell> boytoy: Good times.
[14:57:17] <boytoy> yup
[14:57:27] <boytoy> both then and now. not to mention the ones ahead!
[14:58:10] <slick-> is there a plugin
[14:58:10] <slick-> http://lopatin.github.io/sliderTabs/
[14:58:12] <slick-> like that
[14:58:13] <grafi> everything is downhill from here
[14:58:14] <slick-> that anyone knows of?
[14:59:07] <BillCriswell> A tabusel.
[15:04:00] <sunbeam> when i have <div class="class-one">..</div> and <div class="class-two">..</div> next to each other i want to wrap them in a <div class="all"> </div>
[15:04:04] <sunbeam> is this some way possible?
[15:07:16] <grafi> `api .wrap
[15:07:16] <b-ot> grafi: No matches.
[15:07:20] <grafi> `api wrap
[15:07:21] <b-ot> grafi: .wrap(): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[15:07:23] <boytoy> BillCriswell: but regarding http://jsfiddle.net/nRnre/2/ why wouldn't $(elem) be in the document until after i addClass('play') etc. to it?
[15:07:31] <grafi> i see
[15:08:49] <sunbeam> thanks grafi
[15:09:21] <sunbeam> grafi: they both will have to be in that wrap
[15:09:25] <sunbeam> not just 1 div
[15:09:29] <grafi> yeah
[15:09:30] <sunbeam> i want both in the same
[15:09:36] <grafi> i noticed that reading the description
[15:09:54] <grafi> thats what the "i see" was for
[15:09:58] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this?
[15:09:59] <sunbeam> ohhh
[15:10:06] <grafi> nope
[15:10:09] <grafi> no idea
[15:10:25] <grafi> whats the sourrounding html look like?
[15:10:38] <boytoy> ah wait hold up
[15:10:49] <grafi> dont tell me what to do
[15:10:50] <grafi> ^^
[15:11:37] <sunbeam> <div class="full"> </div>
[15:11:48] <sunbeam> grafi: those 2 divs are surounded by that
[15:12:15] <grafi> why wrap it again then?
[15:12:55] <sunbeam> no they aren't yet
[15:12:57] <sunbeam> they have to be
[15:13:08] <grafi> yeah thats wasnt the question then ^^
[15:13:33] <grafi> if you have a parent you could maybe use that for some wrapping
[15:13:54] <grafi> would be a more quick and dirty solution of course
[15:18:17] <BillCriswell> boytoy: Ok, had to think about this again.
[15:18:39] <boytoy> BillCriswell: no the bug was elsewhere
[15:19:05] <boytoy> i squished it though
[15:19:17] <boytoy> sprinkled some salt on it and ate it up
[15:19:39] <boytoy> but damn.. been refreshing my jsfiddle so much i think jsfiddle just banned my ip ;P
[15:20:28] <BillCriswell> boytoy: I can't get to it either.
[15:20:39] <boytoy> ah
[15:20:44] <BillCriswell> Was just trying to put some things in the console to help follow what was going on
[15:20:53] <boytoy> maybe my refreshing crashed the whole thing then =)
[15:21:02] <boytoy> but alert($(elem).parent().width()); is the correct thing to do i think
[15:21:55] <boytoy> (which made it work before the addclass thing so)
[15:22:43] <BillCriswell> boytoy: Sweet.
[15:24:19] <boytoy> strange why $(elem).width() worked after the addclass thing though. but hunting for bugs is one thing, hunting for ghosts is another
[16:40:19] <LoneSoldier728> mocha, jasmine or Qunit?
[16:40:31] <snover> intern
[16:41:38] <slick-> when i upgrade my jquery
[16:41:39] <slick-> unrecognized expression: div##st_content_2
[16:41:42] <slick-> i get this problem
[16:42:40] <diphtherial> makes sense, you should only have one pound sign there
[16:42:45] <diphtherial> e.g. div#st_content_2
[16:43:26] <sammych> any better framework than http://pinesframework.org/pnotify/ for notifications?
[16:45:45] <LoneSoldier728> what
[16:45:48] <LoneSoldier728> are u trying to do
[16:45:51] <LoneSoldier728> for notifications
[16:47:42] <sammych> notify
[16:48:15] <diphtherial> seems like a fine notification script to me...if it fulfills all your requirements, i don't see why you'd look for a better one
[16:48:35] <LoneSoldier728> socket io?
[16:48:43] <sammych> well, gotta do my research
[16:48:59] <sammych> can't use websocket, if that's what you're referring to
[16:49:03] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[16:49:05] <LoneSoldier728> why not
[16:49:21] <sammych> the platform I'm working with doesn't support it yet
[16:49:28] <slick-> ong
[16:49:30] <slick-> omg
[16:49:30] <sammych> it's a business platform things
[16:49:30] <slick-> i
[16:49:31] <slick->  fixed it
[16:49:31] <slick-> yesss
[16:49:32] <slick-> !!!
[16:49:50] <LoneSoldier728> kk
[16:49:50] <diphtherial> if i'm not mistaken, this pnotify project is just for displaying unobtrusive notification messages in the corner, nothing to do with server-client communication
[16:49:57] <slick-> tgabjs dip83

[16:50:25] <diphtherial> heh :)
[16:50:27] <sammych> I'll use WS for actually getting the message, if I could
[16:51:04] <sammych> if you all seem to think that it's a pretty decent framework
[17:19:10] <Sirisian> If I have http://pastebin.com/NEg9Z0jf shouldn't "#loginform > input[type='button']:nth-child(1)" select the first button?
[17:20:34] <pixelpimp> take out the >
[17:20:57] <Sirisian> I did. No difference
[17:21:04] <pixelpimp> you don't have any inputs directly inside #loginform
[17:23:07] <pixelpimp> works for me in CSS, so i see no reason why it wouldn't for jquery
[17:23:24] <Velveeta> it shouldn't work in the css either
[17:23:40] <Velveeta> er rather, the > shouldn't
[17:24:24] <pixelpimp> the > should break it
[17:24:29] <Velveeta> right
[17:27:35] <Sirisian> http://jsbin.com/EqeWAZu/1/edit hmm
[17:29:44] <boytoy> any news on jsfiddle?
[17:30:26] <pixelpimp> people are starting to riot
[17:30:29] <Sirisian> I just saw it's down. I just used jsbin.com instead.
[17:30:58] <pixelpimp> you need to load jquery into jsbin manually, i think
[17:31:09] <Sirisian> oh
[17:31:11] <pixelpimp> add library in the top bar, i guess
[17:31:36] <pixelpimp> then click 'play as guest' and voila
[17:31:36] <Sirisian> still doesn't work
[17:31:37] <boytoy> pixelpimp: lol yeah
[17:32:04] <Sirisian> wait
[17:32:10] <Sirisian> why does (1) refer to that one?
[17:32:41] <Sirisian> Register and Login are before that button.
[17:32:54] <boytoy> https://twitter.com/jsfiddle doesn't say anything

[17:33:44] <boytoy> stupid grammar
[17:46:10] <sammych> say I wanted to show/hide based on a bool, like toggleClass/fadeToggle
[17:46:22] <sammych> you can't use toggle(bool)
[17:47:16] <rmurphey> sammych: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/#toggle-showOrHide
[17:48:06] <sammych> ah, thank goodness
[17:48:29] <sammych> I was looking at jqapi, and seems like I shouldn't refer to it anymore
[17:51:41] <rmurphey> it seems jqapi may not deal well with the fact that the same method has multiple meanings
[18:58:14] <boytoy> What's the easiest way to go from a > p > div > div > div > div > #main? I tried $(this).closest('#main') with no luck.
[18:58:44] <boytoy> (assuming $this is the <a>)
[18:59:08] <T13|sleeps> Why not $( '#main' ) directly?
[18:59:28] <boytoy> i can do that?
[18:59:40] <T13|sleeps> Why not?
[18:59:45] <boytoy> i would love to do that
[19:00:00] <tw2113> try it and see
[19:00:05] <T13|sleeps> lol
[19:00:27] <boytoy> haha wow
[19:00:42] <boytoy> sometimes the simplest things.. thanks y'all
[19:00:59] <tw2113> js loves ID selectors like liberals love obama
[19:01:00] <T13|sleeps> If not what you want for some reason, you could also $( 'a' ).find( '#main' );
[19:01:21] <T13|sleeps> Anyways.

[19:06:55] <codepython777> is there a migrate for 1.10.2?
[19:07:27] <boytoy> T13|sleeps: for what it's worth: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BOJH-G0T3I .. but i guess you're not affiliated with him
[19:08:21] <T13|sleeps> Probably not.
