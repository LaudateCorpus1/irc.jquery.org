[00:01:27] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: Can you tell me what it get the extra pixels from?
[00:02:13] <sCoRpi_> ?
[00:02:24] <sCoRpi_> i joined at 9:20
[00:02:40] <Whiskey> hehe
[00:02:41] <sCoRpi_> you didn't write anything since then ;)
[00:02:48] <sCoRpi_> what are you talking about?
[00:02:53] <Whiskey> no i havent
[00:03:09] <sCoRpi_> so, which pixels?
[00:04:29] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/50/, how it comes that it be bigger even that filename is the widhest TD
[00:06:51] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: its really doing my head all this
[00:07:12] <sCoRpi_> Whiskey: I don't know what "it" is, and where "it" is
[00:09:36] <marcules> Mornin'
[00:09:42] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/50/ it shuld be like this http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/51/
[00:10:08] <Whiskey> but then again, it get some extra px from somewhere in the second table when you add more content to it
[00:10:24] <Whiskey> In this case i added stuff to BitrateMode
[00:12:41] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: You see the diffrent right
[00:13:11] <sCoRpi_> Whiskey: yes, but this will take more time than i can spare right now :/
[00:13:50] <sCoRpi_> Whiskey: one suggestion: you want the left and right colums to be equally sized, right?
[00:14:05] <Whiskey> yeh
[00:14:13] <Whiskey> but what does it get does extra px from when its not bigger
[00:14:23] <sCoRpi_> did you try to just load all  the content, and then loop over the tds, finding  the largest one, and  then just apply that size to the rest?
[00:14:26] <Whiskey> i need to understand that and maybe i can try stuff myself. but aslong as i don´t get that its no point to try
[00:14:45] <sCoRpi_> oh  that's what you're doing already, right?
[00:14:55] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: That is one slotion, but i can´t rewrite the whole thing im not that good
[00:15:32] <Whiskey> Yeh sCoRpi_: I have try a few things, but i still don´t understand why it get bigger or why it cuase it. Its not logical to me
[00:17:15] <sCoRpi_> Whsikey: does this solve your problem: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/52/
[00:17:33] <sCoRpi_> you just have to apply it to the 2nd table aswell
[00:18:16] <sCoRpi_> you cuold replace children.width with $('td').width() to target all td's
[00:27:55] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: The first is correct but as you see the second is incorect
[00:28:06] <sCoRpi_> did you even read what i wrote?
[00:28:24] <sCoRpi_> about 20 lines before this
[00:28:30] <sCoRpi_> you'll find the solution for that
[00:28:41] <Whiskey> yeh count every tds
[00:29:00] <Whiskey> if it was what you meaned :) but i have no clue how you do that
[00:29:33] <sCoRpi_> wtf?
[00:29:37] <sCoRpi_> [10:17] <sCoRpi> you just have to apply it to the 2nd table aswell
[00:29:37] <sCoRpi_> [10:18] <sCoRpi> you cuold replace children.width with $('td').width() to target all td's
[00:29:55] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: not sure i fallow
[00:30:03] <sCoRpi_> yeah i see you don't
[00:30:14] * BinaryKitten tries to read back and follow
[00:30:41] <BinaryKitten> TheFuzzball ...
[00:30:43] <sCoRpi_> just replace "children.width(maxWidth);" with "$('td').width(maxWidth)" in the fiddle
[00:30:46] <sCoRpi_> and it will be fine
[00:31:06] <sCoRpi_> or use any other selector to target the appropriate td's
[00:31:38] <sCoRpi_> BinaryKitten: don't bother to follow ;)
[00:31:51] <BinaryKitten> sCoRpi_ i picked that up
[00:32:01] * BinaryKitten wonders if she knows TheFuzzball
[00:32:04] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: You mean http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/55/
[00:32:26] <sCoRpi_> Whiskey: yeah looks like that's what i mean
[00:32:30] <sCoRpi_> it's correct now isn't it?
[00:32:35] <jmverges> hi all
[00:33:12] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: Yes it is untill you do this: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/54/
[00:33:33] <sCoRpi_> god whiskey
[00:33:36] <sCoRpi_> seriously
[00:33:44] <sCoRpi_> just change the code which gets the max width
[00:34:45] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: Remeber i don´t kn ow javascript that well how wuld i know what you espected for output :/
[00:35:19] <Whiskey> did allredy think it got maxWidth from the var maxWidth=Math.max.apply (
[00:35:28] <sCoRpi_> whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/56/
[00:35:46] <sCoRpi_> you'll notice how it's now not fully what you'd expect it to be
[00:36:08] <Whiskey> yeh
[00:36:11] <sCoRpi_> if you look at the page without javascript you'll see that it actually behaves how it should, just that your largest column is really large
[00:36:29] <sCoRpi_> and  that's why it gets stretched
[00:36:41] <juria_roberts> Hi i have an element with name in the format abc^def but my variables have names in the format abcdef.How do I select the element based on the variable name?
[00:37:18] <sCoRpi_> juria_roberts: that doesn't even sound logical
[00:38:02] <juria_roberts> sCoRpi_: yeah i was hoping that in jquery there was a like selection
[00:38:04] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: I don´t fallow
[00:38:25] <Whiskey> The row have like 70% more to fill and even that it stretched the box
[00:38:36] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/NLRTp/
[00:39:09] <sCoRpi_> juria_roberst: even if you had something like "like", it wouldn#t work. since if you have abc^def and you use something like "find everything where the class is like 'abcdef'" it wouldn't find anything
[00:39:26] <Whiskey> BinaryKitten: thats correct also, but rows not 50/50 in your case all rows shuld have the width of filename
[00:39:27] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/NLRTp/1/ would be slightly better memory wise
[00:39:58] <sCoRpi_> BinaryKitten: thanks for taking over ;)
[00:40:04] <BinaryKitten> if you want them "50/50"
[00:40:08] <BinaryKitten> then set them 50 50
[00:40:13] <Whiskey> where?
[00:40:34] <Whiskey> the css not apply it
[00:40:37] <BinaryKitten> $('table').find('td').css('width', '50%');
[00:41:13] <Whiskey> naa that be qrong
[00:41:19] <BinaryKitten> no that be right
[00:41:33] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/NLRTp/2/ <--
[00:41:34] <BinaryKitten> if you don't give us the right information then we can't help you
[00:41:47] <Whiskey> BinaryKitten: The problem is tha ti don´t allow newlines
[00:41:54] <Whiskey> thats why i try to calulate it in js
[00:41:55] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/qHT6k/1/
[00:41:56] <sCoRpi_> BinaryKitten: he'll come up with something to break that code now
[00:41:57] <Whiskey> 50/50 no new liens
[00:42:35] <Whiskey> thats why javacript need to do it BinaryKitten: Cuz it won´t know else that it not allowed to break the lines
[00:42:44] <sCoRpi_> Whiskey: i think your main problem is that you don't accept that your table will resize if your drawing area isn't big enough
[00:42:59] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_: what you talk about?
[00:43:02] <sCoRpi_> so if you resize your browser, the table will be made smaller of the viewport changes
[00:43:18] <sCoRpi_> sorry, gotta work now
[00:43:20] <Whiskey> naaaa thats not true i have fullscreen 27*
[00:43:37] <jmverges> hey, I would like to do a refactoring and to document a platform, I would like to know what documentation generator and javascript unitary test
[00:43:59] <jmverges> you recommend me
[00:44:02] <Aqeel> best solution set min width say for resolution 800x600 and keep max as possible to resolution 1024x768 and thus centered
[00:44:21] <Whiskey> BinaryKitten: You still here
[00:46:40] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/NLRTp/3/ <-- thats what i try JS to caluclate
[00:48:10] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/NLRTp/3/ <-> http://jsfiddle.net/NLRTp/4/ <--- thats how i espect the JS to work
[00:48:23] <BinaryKitten> sCoRpi_ it's a lost cause.. massive monitor trumps knowledge of how web works
[00:48:41] <sCoRpi_> BinaryKitten: sad but true
[00:48:58] <Whiskey> Why con´t JS do what i make in those two examples
[00:49:07] <Whiskey> no one have still not answer that question
[00:49:56] <BinaryKitten> Whiskey the issue i see is a communication one. I can't actually see what you're trying to achieve that requires you to use JS
[00:50:12] <sCoRpi_> BinaryKitten: tried that road 2 days ago...
[00:50:53] <BinaryKitten> also you keep asking small questions. These small questions lead people to give you small direct answers. Unfortunately these don't seem to be the answers you want.
[00:51:12] <BinaryKitten> This causes annoyance for both you and the people trying to help you
[00:51:26] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/NLRTp/3/ <- look at the bitrate its the widhest td, then set width after that
[00:51:55] <Whiskey> jsfiddle.net/NLRTp/4/ <-- in that one filename is the widhest td, then set the width after that one
[00:52:06] <Whiskey> you se it se exaclty the width it need to get the stuff fit in the box
[00:52:27] <BinaryKitten> actually no it's not
[00:52:28] <Whiskey> thats what i try to do, and keep the lines 50%50% width
[00:52:41] <BinaryKitten> what it's done is stretch the Table to fit
[00:52:59] <Whiskey> you mean what i did to show it?
[00:53:03] <Whiskey> i set the px in table css
[00:53:21] <Whiskey> table {width: Xpx;]
[00:54:15] <BinaryKitten> you might have done
[00:54:26] <BinaryKitten> but the tables are different widths in both those examples
[00:55:15] <BinaryKitten> there are a lot of problems with the css there .. like floats in the table cells
[00:55:36] <BinaryKitten> those floats will cause problems when you try to fix the widths of the items
[00:55:52] <Whiskey> binary: but why does it always work for the first table?
[00:56:26] <BinaryKitten> Whiskey magic
[00:56:34] <Whiskey> yeh its something like that i start to belive in
[00:56:38] <BinaryKitten> Whiskey try putting in a longer filename
[00:56:43] <BinaryKitten> it'll break then
[00:56:49] <BinaryKitten> it'll be a bigger table
[00:57:04] <BinaryKitten> it just happens that you've got a almost perfect filename
[00:57:10] <BinaryKitten> but anyway the point is
[00:57:33] <BinaryKitten> you need to figure this one out yourself. no amount of JS is going to solve this problem of yours
[00:58:48] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/57/ <--- work just fine BinaryKitten
[00:58:58] <Whiskey> its not break
[00:59:12] <BinaryKitten> Whiskey IF that works fine, then why keep bothering us?
[00:59:24] <Whiskey> Cuz i tell you its the second table that breaks always
[00:59:28] <Whiskey> Its that one that is the problem
[00:59:46] <BinaryKitten> then fix it, you've figured out with your smarts how to do the 1st one
[00:59:57] <Whiskey> BinaryKitten, no its not my code
[01:00:44] <Whiskey> I have try to slove this for 5weeks know exactly same problem BinaryKitten
[01:01:12] <BinaryKitten> right Whiskey. Then move on. Don't get stuck on such a small thing when i'm sure that there are lots of other things to be completed.
[01:01:15] <Whiskey> <div class="infoViewMedia"> <-- its inside that everything breaks BinaryKitten
[01:01:25] <BinaryKitten> then FIX that
[01:01:29] <Whiskey> BinaryKitten: its my last parts
[01:01:31] <Whiskey> I can´t
[01:01:40] <Whiskey> i have try evverything why do you think i ask for helo?
[01:01:47] <Whiskey> Else i wuld fix my self
[01:01:50] <BinaryKitten> if you have a broken lightbulb you don't go repainting the house
[01:02:12] <seba4> how could you refresh just part in a form.. just select and its values ..
[01:02:20] <BinaryKitten> narrow your focus, listen when people are being helpful and sort out the CSS
[01:02:36] <Whiskey> BinaryKitten: the CSS part its prob not the problem
[01:02:52] <Whiskey> i have display: table in my body, that couse many problems
[01:03:02] <Whiskey> but it also make everything just use the space it needs
[01:03:18] <BinaryKitten> Whiskey I, and i am sure a lot of people, are done being civil, courteous and patient. Please stop pestering us
[01:03:51] <Whiskey> Binary: i have try slove this whit CSS 4 weeks before i come in to this channel
[01:04:05] <Whiskey> whitout any JS many ppl have try that two no one have manage to do that
[01:04:12] <Whiskey> including me
[01:04:46] * BinaryKitten places selective ignores
[01:05:13] <Whiskey> BinaryKitten: I don´t know what else what do you espect from me?
[01:05:33] <BinaryKitten> seba4 can you clarify "refresh" please?
[01:05:54] <TheFuzzball> BinaryKitten Just got up for work?
[01:06:04] <BinaryKitten> TheFuzzball no
[01:06:12] <TheFuzzball> In work?
[01:06:19] <BinaryKitten> TheFuzzball are you who i think you are?  Luke?
[01:06:27] <TheFuzzball> Aye
[01:06:31] <BinaryKitten> heh
[01:06:47] <BinaryKitten> TheFuzzball just about to leave for the office. They hav flexitime now
[01:07:16] <wroos> Hi! I use a ajax request to get a string from a page, I wonder how I can fade-in that text?
[01:07:17] <TheFuzzball> Yeah, I work 1000-1800
[01:07:20] <seba4> i will gist it ...
[01:07:23] <seba4> just a sec
[01:07:37] <wroos> Maybe I can do something like $(".slogan").html(ajax_load).load(loadUrl).fadeIn(2000);  ?
[01:07:37] <BinaryKitten> seba4 thanks i'm sure someone will help you when they get the chance
[01:08:09] <BinaryKitten> seba4 unfortunately i have to depart for the office now
[01:09:05] <Whiskey> BinaryKitten?
[01:10:18] <BinaryKitten> sCoRpi_ nice tag teaming with you.. catch you later
[01:10:42] <seba4> oh :) thx anyway
[01:11:12] <seba4> this is the code i have... it works dialog is opened and i can add new message
[01:11:19] <seba4> after that i close dialog...
[01:11:20] <seba4> https://gist.github.com/4509126#file-_form-html-erb-L17
[01:12:03] <seba4> but after dialog close i need a part of page to be refreshed...  options should be refreshed... so i get this new type of message in a lust
[01:13:53] <seba4> in a  *list
[01:16:04] <trinadh> seba4: options should be refreshed means you need to replace the options or just reset...
[01:16:12] <trinadh> ?
[01:16:56] <Nebros> i have a little question about the function validate... (im a very new programmer and started with jquery 12h ago) ^^ i have a form with one input. what i have done now: the field is required and minlength is 9. that works... but i need to define like this: 3chars6numbers. but how?
[01:17:55] <seba4> i need to just update options ..
[01:18:17] <seba4> not everything because then i would lose what user already inputed but didn't save
[01:18:51] <Aqeel> seba4: you need to make use of catch..
[01:19:20] <trinadh> seba4: ok update ... what i am trying to understand is say you have options 1,2,3,4 and now they should become a,b,c,d ?
[01:20:24] <seba4> no no
[01:20:52] <seba4> i got options 1,2,3,4 ... and there is a link for new option which is inputed in a form.dialog
[01:20:57] <Aqeel> cache*
[01:20:58] <seba4> this new option should be added
[01:21:01] <seba4> like 1,2,3,4,5
[01:25:37] <Nebros> can someone help me by the function validate? its a basic question... ^^
[01:27:25] <Cork> ?ask @ Nebros
[01:27:25] <bot-t> Nebros, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:27:37] <Nebros> (im a very new programmer and started with jquery 12h ago) ^^ i have a form with one input. what i have done now: the field is required and minlength is 9. that works... but i need to define like this: 3chars6numbers. but how?
[01:27:58] <trinadh> seba4: http://fiddle.jshell.net/w6fkb/ something like this
[01:28:17] <Cork> Nebros: what are you using to validate?
[01:29:57] <seba4> it looks interesting ... just need to pass data from database ... or the one i got from creating
[01:29:57] <Nebros> jquery.validate.js this im using
[01:30:31] <Nebros> and mhh this one on the link is tho high lvl for me atm ^^
[01:31:33] <Nebros> what i have till now:
[01:31:46] * xec ducks
[01:31:47] <Nebros>                     required: true,
[01:31:53] <Nebros>                     minlength: 2
[01:32:01] <xec> ?p @ Nebros
[01:32:01] <bot-t> Nebros, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:32:17] <Nebros> and that works in my script
[01:34:31] <xec> Nebros: where are the docs for this plugin?
[01:35:15] <Nebros> how i can link this jsfiddle...
[01:35:42] <xec> hit save and you should get a new url, just copy/paste that
[01:37:50] <Nebros> and this script is what is used on http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[01:38:22] <xec> Nebros: right. it looks like regex isn't one of the methods you can validate by (!)
[01:38:34] <xec> Nebros: maybe have a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/280759
[01:39:35] <xec> Nebros: then you could use a regex like "[a-zA-Z]{3}[0-9]{6}"
[01:40:26] <xec> assuming by "chars" you mean "letters"
[01:42:13] <xec> actually, it'd be more like "^[a-zA-Z]{3}[0-9]{6}$"
[01:50:55] <Nebros> with pattern it looks like this what you have posted xec. but this damned ie9 is to stupid for this. -.-
[01:56:01] <xec> i'm not entirely sure what you mean by that :)
[01:57:10] <Nebros> i mean, this simply function is called "pattern" in html5 but ie9 cant use html5...
[01:58:04] <xec> aha, right
[01:58:18] <xec> maybe someone has made a shim?
[01:58:20] <Nebros> thats why i have to use jquery... as a new programmar, with troubles by simply html, is jquery the death
[01:59:12] <Nebros> i will try it with your link... but i need time :D
[01:59:34] <Jone> Hi all
[01:59:52] <xec> Nebros: maybe check out this instead: https://github.com/dsheiko/HTML5-Form-Shim
[02:00:10] <xec> haven't used it myself, but looks promising at first glance
[02:00:23] <xec> Hi, Jone
[02:00:47] <t432> i'm working with the jquert validator plugin.  This form seems to submit to server even when invalid input exist... what i'm i doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/gXftxkw3
[02:01:50] <Jone> can anyone explain if there is a response limit when using JSONP? I get the following error in FF '8],[43.235363757192445,-11.873940764601315],[43.235363757192)' where the response is incomplete
[02:02:17] <Jone> SyntaxError: missing ] after element list
[02:02:47] <Jone> when I validate the JSON response from the URL, it validates ok
[02:02:48] <coldhead> ?jsonlint @ Jone
[02:02:48] <bot-t> Jone, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[02:03:05] <Jone> the response is valid
[02:03:12] <coldhead> i wouldn't expect there to be a limit
[02:03:18] <coldhead> because it's just a <script> tag
[02:03:31] <coldhead> but maybe if you're returning some seriously huge array
[02:03:39] <coldhead> it works in other browers?
[02:05:02] <Jone> It doesnt work in chrome or FF
[02:05:06] <t432> anyone?
[02:05:18] <Jone> and its a geojson format, so it has large arrays
[02:05:31] <Jone> in plain text file the response is approx 1.2 mb
[02:05:56] <Jone> and validating in jsonlint, it comes up with unresponsive script..
[02:06:11] <Nebros> ok, i have done it now. and it works. =)
[02:06:34] <coldhead> that's not too huge, Jone
[02:06:58] <Nebros> thx xec, i did not understand, that i have to create first this function, to use it...
[02:07:01] <coldhead> what i would try is saving the output into a separate file and just loading it with a <script src="my_test_data.js"></script>
[02:07:17] <coldhead> and see if that works, like if it creates any objects or functions that are visible
[02:07:28] <Jone> thanks
[02:07:32] <Jone> I will try that
[02:08:12] <Nebros> learning by doing and trying... and far throw laptop. xD
[02:08:16] <coldhead> it might be no help at all, but it may give you more data :\
[02:08:21] <coldhead> hahahah Nebros
[02:08:24] <coldhead> very true
[02:08:48] <coldhead> t432: i don't rememer how validate works well enough to see any problem
[02:09:00] <coldhead> t432: if you really want to use the validate path try some simpler rules
[02:09:12] <coldhead> like just .validate() and class="required"
[02:09:18] <coldhead> to see if at least that works
[02:09:27] <coldhead> but personally i would do all that validation in html5
[02:09:33] <coldhead> <input type="email">
[02:09:42] <coldhead> <input type="text" maxlength="3">
[02:09:45] <coldhead> etc
[02:09:54] <coldhead> and use an html5 shim to support older browsers
[02:09:59] <coldhead> that way you don't have to write any JS
[02:10:05] <coldhead> laziness ftw
[02:10:06] <t432> but html5 validation is still premature... well according some of the stuff i read
[02:10:14] <coldhead> it's not in all browsers
[02:10:22] <coldhead> but if you use shims it's as thought it were
[02:10:28] <coldhead> i use it all day every day
[02:10:31] <coldhead> and i never get fired
[02:10:38] <coldhead> even when i am drunk at the office!
[02:10:39] <Nebros> http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/inputs.html
[02:10:44] <t432> i think i'll stick to jquery
[02:10:56] <coldhead> well try the simple validate() first
[02:10:57] <t432> for now.
[02:11:00] <coldhead> and build it up again
[02:11:10] <coldhead> see which bit breaks it
[02:11:30] <t432> it does not intercept at all
[02:11:42] <coldhead> are you sure the selector is correct?
[02:11:49] <coldhead> you have the right ID?
[02:11:57] <coldhead> do you see any errors in the console?
[02:12:36] <Nebros> how can i turn off this join and left reports in this irc? ^^
[02:13:34] <coldhead> it depends on your client, Nebros
[02:13:51] <coldhead> some clients have "conference mode" which suppresses them
[02:13:59] <coldhead> i find them comforting
[02:14:05] <coldhead> they remind me that life is fleeting
[02:14:19] <Whirl3d> I need help with determining when a CSS animation ends. I'm close, but I am messing something up: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Uq8hy/
[02:14:53] <coldhead> oh you are on the web client, Nebros . you need to download a proper client for that kind of thing
[02:15:03] <Whirl3d> There may be a better way to do what I want. Basically, I can't access my close button....
[02:16:00] <dirkpennings> can I use a selector for both input type radio and checkbox? like $(e).is('[type="checkbox"][type="radio"]') ?

[02:17:09] <Nebros> thx coldhead, the spam is turned off now. =)
[02:17:35] <coldhead> good work Nebros
[02:17:47] <coldhead> goddamn it Whirl3d this is some seriously fancy css
[02:18:00] <coldhead> i can't even work out how you are doing this, let alone the problem
[02:18:44] <coldhead> t432: maybe you need to call addMethod?
[02:25:00] <Whirl3d> what do you mean. it looks good though in production. I was just hoping not to have to manually animate the buttons.
[02:26:13] <Whiskey> Whirl3d :D
[02:26:17] <Whirl3d> You can drag the elements in the bar around using the button on the right. (sort of) and the button on the left should let you close that element. But it's not registering click events because it's below the sortable element
[02:27:05] <coldhead> it's very cool, Whirl3d
[02:27:06] <Jone> Hi coldhead, when I did as you suggested, firefox come with the following error message
[02:27:07] <Jone> SyntaxError: invalid label [Break On This Error] 	  {"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","id  my-test-data.js (line 1, col 1) 	
[02:27:09] <coldhead> too complicated for me
[02:27:57] <Whirl3d> thanks for lookin' though.
[02:27:57] <coldhead> >: | i can't see the error there Jone
[02:30:00] <Jone> coldhead is there a difference in how json and geojson is handeled?
[02:30:23] <coldhead> omg yes!
[02:30:27] <coldhead> i was just about to ask you
[02:30:34] <coldhead> JSONP is wrapped in a function
[02:30:49] <coldhead> JSON is just a regular JS object literal
[02:31:08] <coldhead> you might be missing the functiony bit?

[02:31:45] <poiz> i want to show/hide multiple instances of the same div class on a page, the script works if theres one class but not several, any ideas?
[02:32:49] <Jone> thanks coldhead
[02:33:43] <coldhead> show us the code, poiz
[02:33:46] <coldhead> ?p @ poiz
[02:33:47] <bot-t> poiz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:35:01] <poiz> http://jsfiddle.net/qbhK3/4/
[02:35:06] <Jone> when I load the plain json from the localhost, the json works fine. When I use jsonp I get my original problem. When jsonp adds the something_timestamp({lotsofjson}) it cuts the jsonp just cuts around 1 mb
[02:35:30] <poiz> i have many instances of 'dass2' and txt1 i want to hide and show selectively and separately of each other
[02:37:50] <coldhead> i don't know, Jone
[02:37:56] <coldhead> is there any way to request less data?
[02:37:57] <ravenzz> what is wrong with this ? http://pastie.org/5667095
[02:38:00] <coldhead> make two calls?
[02:38:42] <Jone> here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/dAqTB/7/
[02:38:46] <ravenzz> should I use a function and return the obj instead?
[02:39:19] <coldhead> poiz: http://jsfiddle.net/qbhK3/6/
[02:39:30] <coldhead> alt $(this).find('.someclass').hide()
[02:39:34] <Jone> i will try to return a smaller response and see what happens.. thanks
[02:40:15] <poiz> coldhead thanks a lot, will put that in now
[02:40:49] <coldhead> Jone: 1.2 mb is quite a lot, your users would prefer to load it in pieces anyway
[02:43:33] <ravenzz> of course using an iife it works http://pastie.org/5667114
[02:43:41] <ravenzz> I wonder what is wrong with the 1st one?
[02:44:37] <coldhead> ravenzz: in the 1st one, it isn;t clear what `this` is
[02:44:42] <coldhead> but i would assume `window`
[02:44:49] <ravenzz> seems so, but
[02:45:09] <ravenzz> doesn't this refers to the parent obj
[02:45:10] <coldhead> also doesn't explain why an alman function fixes it
[02:45:14] <ravenzz> in plain js?
[02:45:21] <coldhead> i am pretty drunk, sorry

[02:50:31] <ravenzz> Dirkos [rel="closewindow"]
[02:50:47] <MoTiOnXml> mico: i.e. "find starting with the immediate following tr?"
[02:50:51] <MoTiOnXml> mico: allright, cool
[02:50:56] <MoTiOnXml> makes sense
[02:50:58] <miCSu> MoTiOnXml: just be sure there ain't tbody

[03:41:02] <sunbeam> Does anyone know if it's possible to have a slider that displays multiple slides (<li>'s) at once?
[03:41:13] <sunbeam> and each time you click next button it shows one more <li> ?
[03:44:09] <mindis|work> of course, it's just a matter of having slides that fit in the viewing element two at a time
[03:44:36] <jonkri> the change event data of a selectbox seems to contain the string of the option selected. is there some way i can get an index value instead?
[03:45:34] <mindis|work> you can get it from the name attribute of the element at least
[03:45:58] <sunbeam> mindis|work: how do you mean?
[03:46:05] <evaluate> Hello.
[03:46:16] <sunbeam> mindis|work: there are 4 slides (4*200px) that fit in the viewport
[03:46:34] <evaluate> Is it possible to execute a function when a specific element gets it's display property changed from block to none, or vice versa?
[03:47:28] <Whirl3d> evaluate, what is causing the change?
[03:48:16] <mindis|work> sunbeam well assuming your view is currently also 200px, you'd have to either make the slides 100px or make the view 400px. in any case how much the slides are moved when changing should be determined by the width of the slide if you want them to change so that one of previous slides remains in view
[03:48:41] <mindis|work> assuming it is a horizontal slideshow anyway
[03:48:47] <sunbeam> mindis|work: no the total width is 800px
[03:48:55] <sunbeam> the slide should be 200px each (the <li>'s)
[03:49:02] <sunbeam> when I click >
[03:49:16] <sunbeam> One more slide from the right side should appear and one from the left should slide away
[03:49:31] <mindis|work> oh that way. well then just move the container of the slides by 200px to whatever direction you need
[03:50:00] <sunbeam> mindis|work: any plugin that can do this? I use flexslider now
[03:50:08] <zulu-gula> how to compare two dates in format: 2013-01-11 04:00
[03:51:40] <mindis|work> sunbeam http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9006452/can-jquerycycle-show-multiple-images-at-once-but-slide-one-at-a-time
[03:51:57] <evaluate> Whirl3d, it's a script with a popdown date-picker. The click on a specific input triggers the showing of the dropdown, but the hiding can be triggered by multiple things, like unfocusing the dropdown, unfocusing the input, etc. So instead of also hooking into all those events, I thought it would be easier to just hook into the display property change of the dropdown.
[03:53:56] <nFFF> evaluate, you'd probably just create one code block/function, and trigger/execute it from within all your other events
[03:54:13] <Whirl3d> I don't think there is a way to watch an attribute of an element without setting up a timer--which is ugly.
[03:54:49] <Teaboy> is there a simple way to do XMLHttpRequest.send('hello') in jquery? i.e. $.post() without key pairing
[03:54:50] <evaluate> nFFF, yeah, but since the change can be triggered by multiple events, it is a bit cumbersome, that's why I asked the initial question.
[03:55:02] <evaluate> Whirl3d, I see. Indeed I wouldn't want to use timers...
[03:55:19] <mindis|work> zulu-gula iirc you can compare those dates without any conversions or tricks with simple date1 > date2 and so on
[03:55:27] <Whirl3d> evaluate, but the sliding of the window should have a callback. That doesn't require a bunch of triggers
[03:55:56] <Whirl3d> you could just put your code in the callback of the animate up function however it is configured.
[03:55:57] <evaluate> Whirl3d, what do you mean with "sliding of the window" please?
[03:56:26] <Whirl3d> when you say a popdown data picker, what is that?
[03:56:31] <Whirl3d> date*
[03:56:36] <nFFF> evaluate, I'm not sure why it's cumbersom
[03:56:47] <nFFF> it's 1 tiny line fo code for each event
[03:56:51] <evaluate> Whirl3d, ohh, you mean the animation of the dropdown when it hides/shows? I think that would be a simple .hide()/.show() and AFAIK those don't have callbacks, do they?
[03:57:03] <Whirl3d> yep
[03:57:05] <zulu-gula> mindis|work, ah, you're right, I havn't work in js for 5 years, now I remember, thank you
[03:57:21] <sunbeam> mindis|work: ok
[03:59:08] <sunbeam> mindis|work: thanks, though this is quite old
[03:59:41] <sunbeam> i think i use this, if I cannot find a newer plugin
[03:59:48] <sunbeam> was looking to do it with flexslider
[03:59:52] <evaluate> Whirl3d, btw, the plugin is this one right here: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[04:00:19] <Whirl3d> so what are you asking again?
[04:01:50] <Whirl3d> you may be wanting the onClose  or onSelect callback options
[04:02:41] <evaluate> Ohh, didn't even see those callbacks there, heh. Thanks! :-)
[04:02:52] <Whirl3d> np
[04:04:13] <EdwardIII> hrm, for some reason when i try to do this the window scrolls for too long and way past the element: $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $('#div-to-go-to').offset().top...
[04:05:32] <Whirl3d> EdwardIII, is your content in the body element or do you have it in a div with overflow:scroll or overflow:auto?
[04:06:59] <EdwardIII> Whirl3d: it's not body > element, there are plenty of elements in between heh, i'll look through them and see if something has overflow:auto
[04:07:04] <EdwardIII> nothing has overflow:scroll set
[04:07:31] <Whirl3d> but you are scrolling the page and not an element, right?
[04:07:48] <EdwardIII> that's right, i'm looking to scroll down the page to the top of an element
[04:08:40] <Whirl3d> It may be out of date, but I use Ariel Flescher's (sp?) scrollTo plugin and it handles all of that for me. It's tiny and really useful.
[04:09:47] <Whirl3d> It probably has something to do with subtracting the height of the viewport from your scrollTop position or something like that. I could never get scrolling to work on my own.
[04:10:31] <EdwardIII> heh quite a lot of code in his plugin for what i thought was a simple task
[04:11:35] <sanderj_> How do I replace an element with some other html?
[04:11:43] <Whirl3d> post your code to a fiddle and I'll bet someone could figure it out. My experience has been that scrolling the page (heck scrolling anything) is more hassle than I could deal with.
[04:12:09] <sanderj_> I only got a referance to the actual element I want removed.
[04:12:16] <Whirl3d> $("#originalid").html(somehtml); sanderj_
[04:13:06] <sanderj_> Whirl3d, that will keep the #orginalid element around, I want it totally replaced.
[04:14:06] <Whirl3d> ? .replaceWith()
[04:15:08] <Whirl3d> $(elem).replaceWith("<p>new paragraph</p>");
[04:19:45] <sanderj_> Whirl3d, thanks alot! :-)

[04:21:02] <Whirl3d> ya wanna give us a little bit more info?
[04:21:08] <Whirl3d> great thanks
[04:21:28] <Whirl3d> you have to evaluate the input results into a number. They start as strings
[04:26:44] <mindis|work> interesting. i managed to make a loop that outputs undefined as its current loop index
[04:27:58] <mindis|work> what a crappy array that was

[04:36:43] <Whirl3d> lookup $.before() or $.after()
[04:46:52] <t432> can you listen for an event in a text field? e.g. show alert when a text field has value?
[04:48:25] <Whirl3d> not easily.
[04:48:51] <Whirl3d> You could setup a function that captured keystrokes and checked the field for every keypress event

[04:57:44] <Whirl3d> this is not defined
[04:58:28] <Whirl3d> before your ajax call, try var elem=$(this); and inside the ajax callback function try toggle_tag(elem);

[05:06:02] <Whirl3d> I don't have any experience with uploading files, I am afraid.
[05:07:07] <brend_> anybody here has any idea why this is only working in the first row of my table results? http://jsfiddle.net/52SCw/
[05:09:27] <Whirl3d> brend, really? You are gonna give us that little bit of code and we are supposed to figure it out? Where's your table?
[05:09:52] <Whirl3d> and what is popover()?
[05:10:47] <mindis|work> brend_ a quick guess would be that you have multiple elements with the id="popup". that is not valid as ids are supposed to be unique
[05:11:06] <brend_> mindis|work: umm u are right
[05:11:17] <brend_> brend_:  how would i change that
[05:11:24] <mindis|work> use a class instead
[05:11:44] <brend_> .popup?

[05:25:13] <guy> what makes it hard?
[05:25:20] <seba4> or what kind of languages too
[05:25:30] <guy> pretty lame. Facebook definitely > gmail.
[05:25:38] <guy> ha! got it.
[05:25:40] <guy> Google Wave
[05:25:47] <guy> That was kinda advanced.
[05:27:12] <mindis|work> google docs probably has quite a bit of sorcery involved
[05:27:39] <nFFF> lol the whole google apps is fully javascript driven
[05:28:02] <mindis|work> yep
[05:29:08] <mindis|work> having written (bad) rich text editors a few times and knowing how complicated it can be, i have no doubt docs has to be quite complex as a whole

[06:16:14] <Anticom2> hey xec :) i've got a nother question which is only semi-related to jq... when i want to clear the content of an iframe... what is the most elegant way to do that? setting the src to "about:blank" (doesn't sound very cross-browser compatible)
[06:16:30] <Anticom2> can i do $('#myFrame').html(''); ??
[06:22:38] <Anticom2> the .html('') thingy doesn't work :/
[06:22:41] <Anticom2> any other ideas?
[06:22:42] <fabioportieri> i like the new site layout :>
[06:23:25] <bitbuzzer> I've got a weird bug with jqueryui - I'm using the tabs plugin and as soon as it creates the tabs, it loads the home page (which is not the page I'm on) into the first tab.
[06:23:45] <Anticom2> bitbuzzer define home page then
[06:24:13] <Anticom2> you mean your "about:home"?
[06:24:24] <bitbuzzer> Anticom2: the home page is www.mysite.com, the tabs is in www.mysite.com/videos
[06:24:51] <Anticom2> well, do you know how firebug's js debugger works?
[06:25:18] <Anticom2> set a breakpoint at your tab initialisation method, look at the callstack, and go step by step untill the home page loads
[06:29:31] <Anticom2> wow... the about-URI's are indeed standartisiest or however this word is spelled in english :D
[06:29:55] <Quest> hi.

[06:31:51] <Quest> http://open-pages.com/Alpinemadotcom/  the menu and slide banner has a clash I think. below before </body> there are two scripts for each menu and banner and they use same or different jquery version. if  I use either or both. the menu dont work or the banner dont work with clicks and no fade in outs or slides (abrubt image change). whats wrong?
[06:40:39] <superdmp> if I load a library that uses $ as an alias for itself, and then another does the same, it will wipe out all the things that were available from the first, correct?
[06:40:59] <Anticom2> not exactly
[06:41:29] <superdmp> but that is how conflicts occur, yes?
[06:41:47] <bitbuzzer> Anticom2 it looks like the tabs widget is loading the tab content via ajax, although I did not specify that option...
[06:42:09] <Anticom2> bitbuzzer there should be an option to explicitly supress that afaik
[06:42:26] <Anticom2> superdmp http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[06:42:34] <bitbuzzer> Anticom2 ok thanks
[06:42:49] <Anticom2> bitbuzzer but i'm not sure :/
[06:42:56] <Anticom2> don't bet on me :D
[06:43:03] <superdmp> thanks Anticom2  but I am also trying to understand the basic concepts of what happens
[06:43:57] <superdmp> how can I find out what $ is at any given moment?
[06:44:06] <Anticom2> console.log($);
[06:44:34] <Anticom2> just google jquery noconflict... i'm sure you will find some articles about what's going on there
[06:45:52] <FernandoBasso> Is there a #jQuery-plugins or something?
[06:46:38] <Anticom2> FernandoBasso if your question is related to a common plugin, you can ask here
[06:46:40] <masentinel900> I need to know how can I tu put two functions in the same script..
[06:46:51] <Anticom2> there's #jquery-de and #jquery-ui afaik
[06:46:54] <Anticom2> at least @freenode
[06:47:04] <FernandoBasso> I wanted to ask opinions about free banner/slideshow plugins.
[06:47:16] <Anticom2> masentinel900 don't get what u want
[06:48:16] <masentinel900> see, I need to do a event click and inside I need to put fancybox and also a ajax request
[06:48:57] <Anticom2> FernandoBasso i recommend reading the docs carefuly again and looking at your console, wether there's any js errors
[06:49:02] <Anticom2> there's nothing more i can do
[06:49:29] <Vasa> hey a quick question, is mouse an 'element' ?
[06:49:37] <Anticom2> ??
[06:49:40] <Vasa> i mean
[06:49:42] <Anticom2> there are events related to mouse
[06:49:42] <geiregjo> :D
[06:49:44] <Vasa> like a div is na element
[06:49:49] <Anticom2> no
[06:49:53] <Vasa> but is it fair to call a mouse an element
[06:50:01] <Anticom2> how would that make sense?!
[06:50:04] <Vasa> alright thanks
[06:50:17] <Vasa> sorry just wanted to make sure before making an actual element follow it
[06:50:33] <Vasa> thank you
[06:50:33] <Anticom2> if you want to detect some global clicks just do something like $('body').click(function(e) { [...] });
[06:50:40] <Vasa> yes yes i know it
[06:50:49] <Vasa> :P
[06:50:58] <superdmp> console.log($) returns the same thing that alert($) was doing: function (a, b) {return new c.fn.init(a,b);} - I was hoping to get the name of the library or something from it
[06:51:15] <Vasa> good luck and thanks
[06:51:21] <Whirl3d> It's been a while since I have asked this question, but have there been any NEW developments in determining text selection in a textarea element? Or is it still a real pain in the arse to handle?
[06:51:53] <Anticom2> jquery has got some infos about that
[06:52:05] <Anticom2> google "jquery get lib version" or something like that
[06:52:37] <Whirl3d> I am familiar with a couple of ways to do it, I was hoping for something new or cutting edge that the Googles didn't know about yet.
[06:52:50] <Anticom2> Whirl3d i just saw a nice plugin related to that i think
[06:53:00] <Anticom2> what exactly do you want to do?
[06:53:05] <Whirl3d> caret?
[06:53:20] <Anticom2> can't remember the name
[06:53:29] <Anticom2> sec, i'm gaming atm :D i'll look it up when i'm done ;)
[06:53:47] <Whirl3d> take your time, thanks.
[06:54:02] <superdmp> thanks Anticom2  I think I am getting somewhere
[06:54:10] <Anticom2> welcome
[06:55:32] <EdwardIII> hrm, i've got a link like <a href="#some-value">, when i $('a').prop('href') it returns http://example.com/#some-value, not just #some-value?
[06:56:35] <Whirl3d> try $('a').text()   ?
[06:56:53] <Whirl3d> Wait, you want the href, not the text
[06:57:03] <EdwardIII> that's right
[06:57:10] <nabr0_> attr('href')?
[06:58:13] <EdwardIII> nabr0_: that does the trick, thanks
[06:58:22] <Whirl3d> you may need to just regex it or var hr= $("a").attr("href"); hr=hr.substr(hr.indexOf("#");
[06:58:38] <EdwardIII> i guess something is happening during/post rendering that turns the url into an absolute one containing the whole address?
[07:01:04] <masentinel900> Somebody know how can
[07:01:13] <masentinel900> I join two functions
[07:01:31] <masentinel900> $("#eject-edit-res").fancybox({ ... with   $.ajax({
[07:01:43] <ravenzz> uhm?
[07:01:54] <masentinel900> Is for may eject in the same click event
[07:02:15] <ravenzz> you can chain them, if that's what you mean
[07:02:32] <ravenzz> oh no $.ajax()
[07:02:42] <ravenzz> sorry I didn't see that one
[07:03:06] <ravenzz> ?demo @ masentinel900
[07:03:07] <bot-t> masentinel900, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:05:57] <nFFF> ?load @ masentinel900
[07:06:03] <nFFF> maybe this is what you mean?
[07:06:20] <Quest> http://open-pages.com/Alpinemadotcom/  the menu and slide banner has a clash I think. below before </body> there are two scripts for each menu and banner and they use same or different jquery version. if  I use either or both. the menu dont work or the banner dont work with clicks and no fade in outs or slides (abrubt image change). whats wrong?
[07:06:57] <Quest> i will brb

[07:10:48] <Quest> back
[07:11:26] <masentinel900> Is that I need to load in a fancybox modal windows a view with ajax server request.
[07:12:22] <masentinel900> So, I need to load the fancybox event in the same function that AJAX request..
[07:13:30] <masentinel900> I did understand?
[07:17:18] <duonglongvinh> alo
[07:17:21] <duonglongvinh> khỏe không
[07:21:04] <nabr0_> masentinel900: there's an example of using fancybox/ajax on the fancybox site - http://fancybox.net/blog
[07:24:48] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/hzQQJ/
[07:24:53] <masentinel900> That is possible?
[07:29:11] <masentinel900> nabr0_: DO you can view my script
[07:30:17] <nabr0_> masentinel900: if you want to display the content of the AJAX call within a fancybox modal, you will need to call fancybox in the callback of the AJAX call, not vice versa
[07:31:25] <masentinel900> So that first is the $ajax funtion
[07:31:30] <masentinel900> function
[07:33:02] <nabr0_> masentinel900: on the page i linked, #5 Display login form, last code box shows you the AJAX call with fancybox in the callback
[07:34:12] <masentinel900> nabr0_: But my ajax data is not from a form. it should get the value of a input and to pass.
[07:34:38] <masentinel900> nabr0_: can do you help me with a example..
[07:35:51] <theresajayne> Can anyone help me with a JQuery question, I have some form inputs and a textarea in an accordian, but i  cannot type spaces in the textarea as it seems to be toggling the state from ui-state-active to ui-state-default
[07:36:10] <masentinel900> $.fancybox.showActivity(); That is the way like fancy enclose the content of ajax request. or is incomplete?
[07:38:18] <theresajayne> can anyone even tell me why space is toggling a state rather tha actually working
[07:45:29] <masentinel900> $.fancybox.showActivity(); That is the way like fancy enclose the content of ajax request. or is incomplete?
[08:04:24] <jammanbo> Has anyone any experience with Cross-domain Ajax requests being rejected by CORS when the content-type is application/json? I've seen some StackOverflow stuff but it all goes back to JQ 1.5.
[08:13:24] <lindii_> is it possible to define more than one $(document).ready(function() ?
[08:14:39] <BillCriswell> lindii_: Toadilly.
[08:16:21] <tw2113> however if you go past 3 of them, the internet explodes lindii_
[08:16:39] <BillCriswell> Fair warning.
[08:16:47] <lindii_> i see
[08:17:05] <BillCriswell> "Fair warning" is an interesting term.
[08:17:28] <jammanbo> That's bullshit. I just tried 4 and nothing happened.
[08:18:10] * BillCriswell has left IRC. ( Quit: Internet Explorer )
[08:18:19] <BillCriswell> Internet Exploded* Haha
[08:18:30] <jammanbo> lulz
[08:18:50] <jammanbo> I can imagine Internet Explorer might explode after 4 alright
[08:20:23] <juboba> I need help with the $.contains method please. I have a small snippet here: http://jsfiddle.net/LrKXz/
[08:20:26] <marcules> In which use case do you need more than one ready listener on document?
[08:21:41] <juboba> my snippet is showing false when it should show true
[08:21:59] <juboba> because the element I'm evaluating really is contained by the other....
[08:23:56] <BillCriswell> How about $('.father').has('.son') ?
[08:24:47] <juboba> BillCriswell, is it the same?
[08:24:47] <BillCriswell> juboba: ^
[08:24:59] <marcules> juboba, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/ the first argument is for the container
[08:24:59] <nabr0_> ^^
[08:25:44] <lindii_> this is weird
[08:25:57] <marcules> juboba, console.log($.contains(father, son)); "father contains son" is true
[08:26:32] <lindii_> i have a slider and once i pull up a dialog the slider starts going faster than it is suppose to be
[08:27:35] <juboba> marcules, according to jquery documentation: jQuery.contains(document.documentElement, document.body); // true
[08:27:38] <BillCriswell> juboba: Yeah. I think the .has() should do what you want as well... I never used contains before and wanted to make sure the results were ok.
[08:28:08] <juboba> BillCriswell, ok, so does the .has() method return true recursively?
[08:28:25] <marcules> juboba, yes - but nevertheless it states jQuery.contains(container, contained)
[08:28:28] <juboba> I mean if the son is contained in the fgrandfather
[08:28:32] <marcules> Maybe the example is faulty
[08:28:40] <BillCriswell> $.contains($('body')[0], $('a')[0]) is the same as $('body').has('a') as far as I can tell haha.
[08:28:46] <juboba> marcules, thanks man!
[08:30:17] <marcules> juboba,
[08:30:19] <marcules> ?find
[08:30:20] <bot-t1> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[08:30:38] <BillCriswell> .find('.son').length could work too haha.
[08:30:45] <BillCriswell> .has() seems to be the right fit for the job?
[08:31:05] <marcules> Is has recursive though?
[08:31:30] <BillCriswell> I don't even know what that means. Like... it'll go deep as it needs to?
[08:31:37] <marcules> yes
[08:31:51] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:32:23] <marcules> Well then .has() is obviously the simplest to use, I'd say too
[08:34:28] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...
[08:35:51] <juboba> BillCriswell, marcules thanks I already fixed it with $.contains (or .has())
[08:35:59] <juboba> I'm building an editable treeview
[08:36:29] <BillCriswell> .has() does not work like I expected it to.
[08:36:43] <juboba> and I needed to prevent folders from being moved into it own subfolders :P
[08:37:18] <marcules> that would be fun :D
[08:37:33] <marcules> "Well shit, now we have to find the node to recover the folder"
[08:37:54] <BillCriswell> .has() appears to be just like .find() for the most part.
[08:39:01] <BillCriswell> I expected a boolean haha.
[08:40:56] <nFFF> it's different
[08:40:56] <hazamonzo> Howdy folks. Can somebody recommend a good XML to JSON -ish jquery plugin? There are a couple out there but i would like a recomendation if possible. A sample of the XML can be found here... http://pastebin.com/WqHFL9iK  the XML is a filesystem directory structure... thing :)
[08:41:06] <nFFF> BillCriswell, find returns all matching descendants
[08:41:11] <hazamonzo> Need to read that into something i can use to create a navigation system
[08:41:16] <nFFF> has() returns the parent element
[08:41:49] <BillCriswell> nFFF: Yeah  I wasn't expecting that haha.
[08:43:11] <BillCriswell> find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element.
[08:43:15] <BillCriswell> has(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element.
[08:43:31] <marcules> o.O
[08:43:37] <marcules> I'd also expect a bool
[08:44:30] <EdwardIII> hrm my brain is stuck on a recursion problem
[08:44:33] <BillCriswell> I don't think I understand how they're different.
[08:44:46] <EdwardIII> i want to make something happen every x seconds, but i also want to be able to cancel it?
[08:45:01] <BillCriswell> Ohh... .has() works more like a filter I guess?
[08:45:10] <BillCriswell> Ok I'll just play with it till I understand haha.
[08:46:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah, ok. I got it 8-)
[08:46:35] <Darkstar1_> Hi everyone. I need a way to trigger the scrollbar display on this page: http://www.monassier.com/index.php?id=302 everytime any of the tab is clicked on.
[08:46:58] <Darkstar1_> right now tab 2012 only shows when the window is resized
[08:50:53] <NoiseEee> anyone have a favorite carousel/gallery/slider with touch support?  don't feel like re-inventing a wheel
[08:52:25] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I've use .cycle in the past. Just found out there's a cycle2. http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/
[08:52:40] <tw2113> i have this one bookmarked for the purpose of mobile NoiseEee http://swipejs.com/
[08:53:39] <NoiseEee> thanks folks
[08:57:11] <EyePulp> just as a reminder - id attrs on elements are still supposed to be unique per-page, right?
[08:57:35] <tw2113> yup
[08:57:36] <NoiseEee> yes EyePulp
[08:58:02] <EyePulp> thought so.  danke
[08:58:39] <EyePulp> I was worried that HTML6 came out and the world flopped around
[08:59:42] <Darkstar1_> Any help?

[09:19:36] <Ziber> What's the best way to loop through a JSON array sent back from a POST request to a PHP script?
[09:20:19] <systemfault> Ziber: json_decode?
[09:20:26] <systemfault> And a foreach...
[09:22:18] <Ziber> I think you misunderstood. I'm getting the data back in JS and I want to loop through it there - I know how I would do that in PHP.
[09:22:25] <Ziber> I want to send an array of data to JS.
[09:22:51] <Ziber> I misphrased my question. My bad.
[09:25:45] <systemfault> Ziber: Then the opposite.. you create a PHP array that contains everything you need then json_encode + echo it
[09:26:01] <systemfault> You can also set the proper Content-Type header
[09:26:13] <Ziber> I do set application/json in PHP.
[09:26:23] <Ziber> I want to loop through that array in Javascript.
[09:26:24] <systemfault> Wonderful
[09:26:34] <Ziber> And am asking how I would do that.
[09:26:35] <systemfault> Well, just use a for loop
[09:27:26] <systemfault> for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; ++i) { doSomethingWith(myArray[i]); }
[09:27:34] <Ziber> var i = 0; for (i = 0; i <= data['array'].length; i++) { $("#id").append(data['array'][i] + "<br>"); }
[09:27:57] <Ziber> is there a .append in jquery, or did i make that up?
[09:28:03] <systemfault> It exists
[09:28:15] <systemfault> You usually append tags though, not text
[09:28:26] <systemfault> Try using span
[09:28:43] <systemfault> $("#id").append('<span>' + data['array'][i] + "</span><br>");
[09:35:05] <zulu-gula> I've created document that looks like this table: http://imgur.com/6HnmB
[09:35:34] <zulu-gula> it's in A4 format, and I would like to print it like it is, without page margins - am I able to do it via jquery or javascript?
[09:35:43] <NoiseEee> zulu-gula: no
[09:36:07] <NoiseEee> zulu-gula: you'd have to convert it to PDF if you want that kind of control
[09:39:09] <jcp_> can i assign a fallback selector to a variable? something like var foo = bar || pie
[09:39:49] <BillCriswell> jcp_: $( foo ); would do what you want I think with that code... unless I'm misunderstanding something
[09:41:29] <jcp_> okay so something like: var foo = $('#foo') || $('#pie');
[09:41:34] <jcp_> i guess i could just try it lol
[09:42:19] <BillCriswell> No I mean var selector = foo || '.default'; $(selector).
[09:42:49] <BillCriswell> Do you need to check to see if the element exists?
[09:44:06] <Ziber> So, my JSON output from my PHP works, but it's not putting anything ont he screen. Here's the PHP and JS: http://pastebin.com/fjEQGVB7
[09:44:29] <jcp_> BillCriswell: yea, basically I want to first try to get $('#select-' + id) and if that doesn't exist get $('#select-monthly'); (those are the real selectors i want to use)
[09:44:45] <BillCriswell> Ziber: dataType: 'json'
[09:45:07] <BillCriswell> $.getJSON() might be a little... easier?
[09:45:14] <BillCriswell> Don't know what word I mean to use there.
[09:45:30] <Ziber> I'm familiar with how this works...
[09:46:27] <foo> I am trying to find a mobile swipe library that allows me to swipe through images. I have looked into a few, but can't seem to find one that does what I want. eg. swipe.js is cool, but it swipes at a fixed width. I want to have several different images that someone can swipe through, but it starts the swipe when someone begins swiping, and then it stops when someone stops swiping. Anyone have any tips on a library that does this?
[09:49:18] <Ziber> No change...
[09:50:11] <BillCriswell> Ziber: Oh, duh. $('list') should probably be $('.list') or $('#list')
[09:50:31] <Ziber> I fixed that already - #list - still nothing.
[09:50:47] <Ziber> I don't think it's treating it as a normal array...
[09:50:59] <Ziber> I tried manually doing data[0]...
[09:51:25] <Armistice> http://pastecan.com/v/NkO9jLb is there any reason why the marginTop would not be added as a style to the element?
[09:51:31] <Armistice> position, and top work fine but not marginTop
[09:51:51] <BillCriswell> Ziber: What do you get when you console.log( data )?
[09:52:52] <Ziber> It's an object, apparently.
[09:53:13] <Ziber> I can look at it just fine in the PHP output with Chrome's "inspect element" too.
[09:53:16] <Ziber> I can look at it just fine in the PHP output with Chrome's "inspect element" tool.
[09:53:47] <Ziber> How do I read it as an object (or convert it to an array) in JS?
[09:55:25] <Armistice> Objects in JavaScript would be like data.something
[09:55:54] <Armistice> However, associative arrays in JavaScript I believe are also called Objects ... data['something']
[09:56:06] <NoiseEee> there are no such things as associative arrays in javascript.
[09:56:29] <BulleTime> hey guys, i was thinking: is it able to recieve the process amount of percent of a ajax call ??
[09:56:46] <BulleTime> (the amount of loaded in percent)
[09:57:19] <BulleTime> i tought this might be possible with jquery / html 5?
[09:58:42] <Whiskey> if (($divid).css("display", "none")) { <-- how do you use that divid is a variable
[09:58:54] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: $(divid)
[09:59:00] <Whiskey> yeh i just notice
[09:59:19] <BillCriswell> I don't notice things till it's embarrassing either. :-p
[09:59:33] <Whiskey> but its still not correct
[09:59:48] <BillCriswell> Yeah it is.
[10:00:02] <Whiskey> if (document.getElementById(divid).style.display == "none") { thats the orginal line
[10:00:05] <lindii_> hey.. i need to be redirected everytime i login.. how can i do in this code to throw an alert without being redirected in case validation fails http://jsfiddle.net/tC4tc/
[10:00:06] <Whiskey> well it not working so something is wrong
[10:00:22] <rakm> hey, how come the submit function doesn't get called? http://pastie.org/5669493
[10:00:28] <BillCriswell> if($(divid).css('display') == 'none'
[10:00:38] <chinoto> Whiskey: I think you need $('#'+divid)
[10:00:47] <Armistice> hmm... ok http://pastecan.com/v/NkO9jLb with this I am able to set marginTop but NOT when it's a negative margin... how-on-earth...
[10:00:51] <BillCriswell> Ah, that too.
[10:01:00] <Whiskey> yeh ofc
[10:01:01] <BillCriswell> I thought divid included that for some reason.
[10:01:02] <Whiskey> its a id lol
[10:01:17] <BillCriswell> $('#' + divid).css('display') == 'none'
[10:02:06] <juboba> BillCriswell, check it out! http://jsfiddle.net/tSadM/
[10:02:34] <juboba> BillCriswell, I'm still having some trouble with the lines
[10:02:56] <BulleTime> no one knows about my question :o
[10:03:01] <Whiskey> that is thx BillCriswell
[10:03:07] <BulleTime> ive asked it a couple of times:S
[10:03:18] <Armistice> Same :/
[10:03:23] <lindii_> lindo pluggin ese
[10:03:33] <Whiskey> jQuery innerHTML = html("") riht
[10:03:39] <Whiskey> "right"
[10:03:55] <Armistice> yes Whiskey
[10:04:33] <Armistice> $("#foo").html("bar") == document.getElementById("foo").innerHTML = "bar";
[10:04:45] <cusco> hi
[10:04:49] <chinoto> boo
[10:04:55] <Whiskey> yeh
[10:05:15] <juboba> BillCriswell, did you see it? the code is inside the `configuracion.js` file.
[10:05:39] <juboba> BillCriswell, you can drag and drop files or folders inside folders
[10:05:55] <cusco> folks using datatables, using .datatable().fnDestroy() before generating datatable, makes the generated datatable not use the specified flags such as iDisplayLength or bAutoWidth
[10:06:09] <juboba> BillCriswell, but when you do so, the lines at the left don't update as they should
[10:07:17] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: hopfolly last problem if ($(#divid).substring(0,5) == "block") {
[10:07:40] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: hopfolly last problem if ($("#" + divid).substring(0,5) == "block") {
[10:09:05] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: What?
[10:09:30] <lindii_> hey.. i need to be redirected everytime i login.. how can i do in this code to throw an alert without being redirected in case validation fails http://jsfiddle.net/tC4tc/
[10:09:31] <masentinel900> How can I receive the info pass through AJAX with jquery..
[10:10:05] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: No idea what you're trying to test on.
[10:11:20] <juboba> BillCriswell, could you see it?
[10:11:21] <Whiskey> its the substring that not work
[10:11:27] <chinoto> Whiskey: did you mean to use html() between the selector and substring?
[10:11:28] <Whiskey> Its a javascript function
[10:11:40] <Whiskey> naaa don´t care about the HTML part :)
[10:11:57] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: I know that, but what string are you trying to test?
[10:12:03] <chinoto> then... what the heck is it supposed to do?!?
[10:12:06] <Whiskey> ooo
[10:12:08] <BillCriswell> The display property on the element?
[10:12:31] <Whiskey> <div id="block0">
[10:12:45] <Whiskey> try to find that one
[10:12:57] <BillCriswell> You want to find elements that begin with "block"?
[10:13:02] <Whiskey> yeh
[10:13:12] <Whiskey> so substring is there to remove the 0 from it
[10:13:25] <chinoto> Whiskey: do you want this $('[id^="block"]')?
[10:13:26] <BillCriswell> $('div[id^=block]')
[10:14:07] <Whiskey> not sure how to apply that hmm
[10:14:13] <chinoto> BillCriswell: I didn't use the inner quotes before, it got grumpy :/
[10:14:22] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: That'll grab all elements that has an ID that begins with "block".
[10:16:21] <Whiskey> if ($(divid[id^=block]) == "block") { not sure if thats correct as divid still an variable
[10:16:38] <BillCriswell> Sweet jesus.
[10:16:43] <Whiskey> hehe :D
[10:16:53] <Whiskey> wtf
[10:16:56] <Whiskey> it need to have #
[10:17:08] <BillCriswell> Still not going to work like you want it.
[10:17:11] <Whiskey> lets see if we get this
[10:18:16] <BillCriswell> You're trying to like... search for an element with two ids?
[10:18:35] <Whiskey> no only single id
[10:18:39] <Whiskey> but it can have 0 1 2 3 and so on
[10:18:56] <Whiskey> so block0/block1/block2
[10:19:19] <BillCriswell> $('div[id^=block]').each(function(){ var $block = $(this); // Do something with $block... });
[10:19:45] <BillCriswell> That'll go through all elements that have an id that begins with "block" and do whatever you want.
[10:20:11] <chinoto> Whiskey: what is the value of this "divid" variable anyway?
[10:21:10] <Whiskey> yeh ofc it is
[10:21:23] <BillCriswell> lol
[10:21:35] <BillCriswell> Might be sitting the rest of this one out!
[10:21:38] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: don´t checkk variable
[10:21:45] <rakm> hey all, i'm grabbing a list of forms from a page and want to bind a submit handler to all of them and preventDefault. The first one is binding, but the rest aren't. What am I doing wrong? http://pastie.org/5669604
[10:22:26] <Whiskey> chinoto: dumb ass like me shuld not do jQuery
[10:23:07] <chinoto> rakm: you only have preventDefault on the one id, so of course it only affects that one
[10:23:30] <BillCriswell> chinoto: It is [id^=foo]
[10:23:35] <rakm> I have it on all of them
[10:23:42] <chinoto> so it is...
[10:23:58] <rakm> or, the selector should be getting all of them atleas
[10:24:04] <chinoto> excuse me as I bang my head against the wall...
[10:24:29] <Whiskey> hm maybe not need to change that line
[10:25:14] <BillCriswell> rakm: What are you trying to do exactly? Submit all forms at once but not allow them to submit individually?
[10:26:05] <rakm> i figured it out i think. when I add a new form, I'm not updating the counter so they all have id=submit-form-1
[10:26:11] <rakm> so they're not binding to all of them
[10:26:21] <hariom> Does the order of adding <script> tag in a html page matters? I have a html file where I can add <script> tag at the top or at the bottom of the. My goal is to show the html on the screen fastest
[10:26:28] <rakm> i didn't include my add-form function in the pastie
[10:26:57] <hariom> i.e. without detail, html should appear first and js may take its own time to load
[10:27:02] <rakm> but i'm duplicating the form there
[10:27:40] <rakm> BillCriswell I just want to submit them all separately with one action
[10:27:44] <rakm> so looping through them
[10:28:28] <rakm> and do it with an ajax call so we can have some animation as they're submitted one by one
[10:28:36] <BillCriswell> Ahh
[10:29:39] <chinoto> hariom: depends on if browsers only start displaying the page when it receives the whole thing
[10:30:21] <chinoto> if browsers start display asap, then putting script at the end makes sense, although W3C validator doesn't seem to like it
[10:30:22] <BillCriswell> rakm: Is it ok if they submit async?
[10:32:15] <foo> I am trying to find a mobile swipe library that allows me to swipe through images. I have looked into a few, but can't seem to find one that does what I want. eg. swipe.js is cool, but it swipes at a fixed width. I want to have several different images that someone can swipe through, but it starts the swipe when someone begins swiping, and then it stops when someone stops swiping. Anyone have any tips on a library that does this?
[10:34:05] <BillCriswell> rakm: You can do $('[id^=foo]').trigger('submit') to trigger submit on all those forms.
[10:34:45] <rakm> BillCriswell I think we *want* to submit them async
[10:35:29] <chinoto> foo: so the problem is that it doesn't have a "kinetic" feel to it?
[10:36:03] <chinoto> I think kinetic is wrong
[10:36:04] <BillCriswell> $('form').on('submit', function(e){ var $this = $(this); $.post( $this.attr('action'), $this.serializeArray() ); } e.preventDefault(); );
[10:36:06] <defaultro> Our fe is javascript. Our backend is java that also talks to Oracle. Is Java still a nice piece to have as part of the system?
[10:36:44] <BillCriswell> $('form').on('submit', function(e){ var $this = $(this); $.post( $this.attr('action'), $this.serializeArray() ); e.preventDefault(); }); *
[10:38:52] <rakm> BillCriswell another q. if I have <form id="submit-form-1"></form>. What's the easiest way to create the same form but incrementing the form number? Do I need to do regex matching or is there a better way?
[10:40:08] <BillCriswell> No need for regex there. You can use .split('-')
[10:40:18] <shoky> or use a class instead..
[10:40:34] <BillCriswell> There's also that.
[10:40:50] <BillCriswell> I assume you needed an id on it haha.
[10:41:23] <rakm> shoky how would we do it with a class?
[10:41:33] <rakm> well even if I do .split(]-'
[10:41:33] <shoky> class="submit-form"
[10:41:36] <shoky> no split
[10:41:43] <BillCriswell> No incrementing or anything.
[10:41:43] <shoky> just clone that one..
[10:41:51] <rakm> hmm, well I still need to target them individually somehow
[10:41:56] <shoky> no problem
[10:41:58] <rakm> maybe just positional in the jquery array
[10:42:27] <rakm> BillCriswell with .split(), i still need to insert the incremented property into the clone i generate
[10:42:44] <rakm> right now, i'm just getting the .outerHTML and appending it to the container element
[10:43:40] <rakm> and unfortunately, class doesn't work. There are elements inside the form that I need to bind to individually
[10:43:54] <rakm> i.e a show/collapse button
[10:44:17] <BillCriswell> rakm: You can use next(), prev(), indexes, etc.
[10:45:19] <rakm> ooh, and I could also just access the parent form from whatever is clicked on
[10:45:21] * rakm claps hands
[10:45:42] <rakm> class it is. thanks peopel!
[10:46:00] <shoky> rakm: its definitely the proper way to do it ;p
[10:46:41] <BillCriswell> If you were curious you could have done.. var id = 'form-id-1', parts = id.split('-'); parts[2] = parseInt(parts[2], 10) + 1; parts.join('-')
[10:46:54] <BillCriswell> shoky: Think of a quicker way to do that?
[10:47:55] <rakm> BillCriswell i got that part, but then how do put that in the new form i'm inserting?
[10:48:05] <rakm> becuase i'm just appending a string of html to the dom
[10:48:33] <arturo2> Hi all.  I'm doing client-side templating, and some elements that are created need handling (actually, autocomplete for a field)
[10:48:39] <BillCriswell> rakm: I'd use var $clone = $('el').clone(true); $clone.attr('new-id')
[10:48:41] <rakm> var form = $(myForm).outerHTML; $(container).append(form)
[10:48:45] <shoky> BillCriswell heh i dono there might be, dont feel like tryin :p
[10:48:52] <BillCriswell> $clone.attr('id', 'new-id');
[10:48:56] <shoky> gtg actually, byby
[10:48:59] <lindii_> umm
[10:49:00] <BillCriswell> shoky: Party pooper!
[10:49:01] <rakm> ah I see
[10:49:04] <arturo2> So I am doing a <script>$('#textbox').autocomplete(blablabla)</script>
[10:49:07] <rakm> thanks for the help shoky
[10:49:19] <lindii_> hey.. i need to be redirected everytime i login.. how can i do in this code to throw an alert without being redirected in case validation fails http://jsfiddle.net/tC4tc/
[10:49:32] <arturo2> How can I *NOT* put that javascript in the page, and instead, put it in my main .js file
[10:49:42] <arturo2> so when the element appears, it's bound automatically?
[10:50:09] <arturo2> Users add textboxes at will, and every textbox has autocomplete
[10:50:13] <BillCriswell> shoky: 'form-id-2'.replace(/\d$/, function(i){ return parseInt(i, 10) + 1 }); Wooo
[10:50:36] <arturo2> so I want to say $('.autocompleted').autocomplete(blabla);
[10:50:54] <arturo2> and then all .autocompleted boxes get the functionality automagically.  Possible?  Se puede?
[10:54:24] <lindii_> ?
[10:55:08] <BillCriswell> lindii_: It depends on the response you get from the script.
[10:55:17] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: I hade a question but my example not working, the last block http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/60/
[10:55:48] <lindii_> i get echo 'Your credentials are not correct'
[10:56:13] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/61/ <-- there you go
[10:56:31] <Whiskey> Open the second and first block and see how the text in first box changes :)
[10:56:32] <BillCriswell> Ok, so if( resp != 'Your credentials are not correct' ) window.location = resp
[10:57:05] <Whiskey> And what i wuld like to do is to add a text if both blocks are closed, but im not sure how to do that
[10:57:38] <juboba> does anybody here know about markdown?
[10:57:52] <greengriminal> I am using the jquery dialog in a ruby on rails application I have the following: http://jsfiddle.net/sYrwV/ the problem is that when I click on a cell I am getting the following in my firebug console: http://i.imgur.com/McaJx.png
[10:57:54] <BillCriswell> juboba: I tried to write something to parse it one time and failed.
[10:58:03] <BillCriswell> I kind of understand it I guess haha.
[10:58:13] <greengriminal> These images are all exist in my images directory.
[10:58:17] <juboba> BillCriswell, I'm looking for something to write documentation with
[10:58:47] <juboba> BillCriswell, do you know how to get styling on markdown?
[10:59:08] <juboba> I mean, does it need to be compiled to get it nice for web?
[10:59:24] <juboba> or can u just use a css sheet?
[10:59:43] <BillCriswell> You'd still need some CSS. It just converts your markdown to html.
[10:59:47] <BillCriswell> http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
[10:59:57] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: You do get what i mean :(
[11:00:09] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: I'm having a hard time following you
[11:00:24] <rakm> BillCriswell, slight hiccup with using classes though. $('.submit-video') returns an array if there are multiple and a formElement if there is just one. That means that after the second one, it clones the whole array
[11:01:01] <BillCriswell> rakm: You could do $('.submit-video:last') to get the last one.
[11:01:16] <BillCriswell> Unless you're adding to the top.. then do $('.submit-video:first')
[11:01:19] <rakm> with clone, should i not appending to the parent or is there another way? what's the right way?
[11:01:30] <rakm> :last. of course
[11:01:34] <BillCriswell> rakm: However you want to do it.
[11:01:50] <rakm> clone by itself doesn't insert it into the dom does it?
[11:02:11] <BillCriswell> rakm: Nope. It has no idea where things should go.
[11:02:55] <BillCriswell> $clone.appendTo($videoList); is how I tend to add items to a list.
[11:03:37] <rakm> err, :last selector returns the last element inside the form
[11:03:40] <rakm> when there is only one
[11:03:58] <BillCriswell> Are you putting a space before it?
[11:04:16] <rakm> :) yes
[11:04:17] <BillCriswell> $('form:last') gets the last form. $('form :last') would get the last element inside the form.
[11:04:19] <rakm> better now
[11:04:23] <BillCriswell> There you go.
[11:04:33] * rakm computerswut
[11:08:46] <lindii_> damn this slider suckz
[11:08:55] <rabx> I am looking at a site that allows users to drag/drop images and change the layout for a montage. http://www.stylemepretty.com/ click the grey circle 'build a board' on the left. When this page loads, on the right, you can modify the size of the montage and drag and drop images.  Is there another plugin I need besides from http://masonry.desandro.com  ?
[11:11:52] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: i have actully come up whit a way to do it
[11:12:14] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: Niiiiiiice.
[11:13:48] <Whiskey> if i have 2 divs like <div class="test"></div> and <div class="test"></div>and so on how do i check if all those is css("display") == "none"
[11:14:09] <Whiskey> i have no clue how to do that actully but it is a way to do it that prob make stuff more easy
[11:14:16] <Whiskey> like findall or something
[11:16:22] <Rchristiani> I am having the hardest time trying to figure out how to get custom tooltip with jquery ui, fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/F5MsB/2/ , is there something I am missing?
[11:17:56] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: You could do $('.test').length === $('.test:visible').length
[11:18:22] <masentinel900> somebody know if I'm using ajax content what datatype I whould to put in the settings?
[11:18:35] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: why lenght?
[11:18:51] <BillCriswell> To see how many the selector selects.
[11:19:50] <Whiskey> if ($('.test').length === $('.test:visible').length.css("display") == "none") {do this}
[11:19:56] <Whiskey> does that work
[11:20:38] <masentinel900> dataType : 'html',
[11:20:41] <BillCriswell> No.
[11:20:47] <BillCriswell> .length has no .css()
[11:21:40] <BillCriswell> if( $('.test').length === $('.test:visible').length ) { // All .tests are visible! }
[11:24:11] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: did not work so good http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/64/ <--- when you hide that box thats open when you come in thats when the text shuld come that i try to add
[11:24:27] <Whiskey> its was not visible i guss i did try to do
[11:25:21] <BillCriswell> If I knew exactly what you were trying to do I'd help but I really have no idea.
[11:25:29] <Whiskey> hidden did not work correct ether
[11:25:42] <Whiskey> Bill when you come in to the fiddle you have3 boxis
[11:25:51] <Whiskey> 1 has a text whit a link, then its 2 box you can open
[11:25:55] <Whiskey> the first one is open when you come in
[11:26:18] <Whiskey> when you close that first one, so both are closed, it supose to get the text in first box to change
[11:26:38] <Whiskey> or if you will open the last one and then close that it shuld also get that text i try to add there
[11:27:14] <Whiskey> So in some way the jQuery need to check if all divs whit "test" is = dissplay: none
[11:27:34] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/vvSgr/
[11:27:40] <BillCriswell> true then false
[11:28:12] <Whiskey> yeh but you see that my fiddle don´t change the text correct
[11:28:13] <Whiskey> right
[11:28:45] <Whiskey> <div id="block0" class="dataViewBox-Data test"> and <div id="bloki0" class="dataViewBox-Data test"> has the value
[11:31:32] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/65/ is that more clear, look at the text you see when you come in open 1 box see the text change
[11:31:44] <Whiskey> when both box are closed it shuld have same text as you have when you first enterd the page
[11:32:40] <BillCriswell> Still not following. Might want to wait for someone else to help.
[11:33:31] <masentinel900> somebody can say me how can I enter to Js forum
[11:35:34] <Whiskey> How can you not fallow, we try to be even more clear, when you go in to http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/65/ first box shows "02: Some data" when you open second box it the first box shows "Test: 01 click here"
[11:35:44] <Whiskey> if you open the third box it shows "Test: 02 click here" fi you close the last box so box2 / box3 is closed text still the same, and what what i try to do is to add back the text it was when you first come in "02: Some data"
[11:36:13] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: You can impossible not understand that
[11:36:45] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: I am just not that bright.
[11:36:56] <nabr0_> i hate when that happens =\
[11:36:56] <Whiskey> :P
[11:37:21] <pods_guest_957> anyone know good tutorials for beinning jquery?
[11:37:46] <Whiskey> anyways the slotion is to check if all $(.test).css("display") == "none")
[11:38:01] <Whiskey> but i have no clue if that will check all maybe it will
[11:38:43] <BillCriswell> That would check the first one.
[11:39:21] <Whiskey> its not even do that BillCriswell :D
[11:39:33] <BillCriswell> Are you quoting .test?
[11:40:06] <Whiskey> yeh
[11:42:50] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/66/ thats not correct, but it did work :D
[11:44:41] <Rchristiani> I am having the hardest time trying to figure out how to get custom tooltip with jquery ui, fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/F5MsB/2/ , is there something I am missing?
[11:55:04] <rindolf> Hi all. http://www.shlomifish.org/fc-solve-temp/js-fc-solve/text/ - why do the jQueryUI tabs here are too tall and with a weird background on Firefox?
[11:55:53] <rindolf> Opera too. Let me try chromium-browser.
[11:56:08] <BillCriswell> Rchristiani: Do you have some kind of tooltip library?
[11:56:19] <rindolf> Same there.
[11:56:27] <BillCriswell> Oh, didn't see UI being included.
[11:57:23] <BillCriswell> Rchristiani: You need a title on it from what I understand.
[11:57:44] <rindolf> .ui-helper-clearfix:after {
[11:57:44] <rindolf>     clear: both;
[11:57:44] <rindolf> }  - this seems to be the problem according to Firebug.
[11:59:42] <Rchristiani> BillCriswell: Yeah, I discovered that, I also found out to fix it! I forgot the item property
[11:59:50] <BillCriswell> Rchristiani: It appears the element needs a title, even if it's empty, to show the tool tip.
[11:59:50] <Rchristiani> Thanks though!
[11:59:51] <BillCriswell> Ok cool
[12:04:31] <rindolf> Fixed thanks.
[12:05:22] <rindolf> What's an easy way to have the same elements (With the same IDs/etc.) in both tabs? Should I just use DOM reparenting for that?
[12:07:13] <jfisk1987> hey guys, im going t a bit crazy just trying to figure out how to get the date ranges for twitter dateranger picker. Any help would be grea,t i already have it implemented but the documentation is shitty

[12:17:46] <rindolf> I mean inside a JS variable called var new.
[12:17:58] <BillCriswell> rindolf: new.find('.fcs_common')

[12:18:15] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:22:29] <NickNack> anyone here familiar with google chart?
[12:25:55] <saedelaere> how can I loop over this kind of json data so I get the values of "measure_date", "minprecip" ...
[12:25:55] <saedelaere> I know Measurement is a object but I do not know the keys of the elements in a Measurement Object.
[12:26:04] <saedelaere> http://ideone.com/9AfTAy
[12:27:57] <masentinel900> <BillCriswell>: hello?
[12:31:08] <masentinel900> <saedelaere>: Hello
[12:31:20] <BillCriswell> Hi.
[12:31:21] <masentinel900> do you want to help me with this?
[12:31:54] * saedelaere takes help from everyone :)
[12:31:55] <masentinel900> <BillCriswell>: can do you help me?
[12:34:54] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: It looks right to me.
[12:36:06] <Whirl3d> saedelaere, try using a for in loop    for (var prop in measurementObj) { var val=measurementObj[prop]; console.log (prop+" = "+val); }
[12:36:54] <masentinel900> http://pastebin.com/q5qV4sFw
[12:37:08] <BillCriswell> I saw this.
[12:37:17] <BillCriswell> You don't have "modal" defined.
[12:40:04] <masentinel900> modal is a CI controller
[12:40:10] <masentinel900> and that controller load aview
[12:40:12] <masentinel900> view
[12:41:26] <BillCriswell> You know what modal means, your JavaScript script doesn't.
[12:41:26] <therealklanni> Does jQuery 1.8 still use "success", "error" and "complete" for the _property name_ in the options object of an $.ajax object? I know the fluent interface is being deprecated in favor of "done"/"fail"/"always" but is that naming convention carrying over to the options object as well?
[12:42:32] <therealklanni> Currently I'm seeing "success" for instance in the options object, but wondering if I should plan on that changing
[12:43:56] <mouses> i have a single-page design site with a fixed menu that scrolls to a section using:   $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $(section).offset().top }, 1000);        .. plz explain why i need "$('html,body')  and why ".offset().top" is the most efficient way to get the top coordinate
[12:44:04] <masentinel900> BillCriswell: What I should to do?
[12:45:00] <mouses> i understand that .offset() returns the x,y and .top will extract the y value ... but is this really the most efficient way to get the top offset? no big deal though
[12:45:52] <mouses> and $('html, body') makes no sense to me... i would understand if it was just $('html') or $('body') to get a reference to one of those tags
[12:46:14] <BillCriswell> That just gets them both.
[12:46:20] <systemfault> mouses: You need to add both only if you want it to work on all browsers.
[12:46:42] <mouses> how does both even make sense logically?
[12:46:49] <mouses> is it a bug or what
[12:46:55] <mouses> the comma throws me off
[12:47:07] <BillCriswell> It just selects more than one thing.
[12:47:10] <systemfault> Welcome to the world of browser idiosyncracies.. I guess
[12:47:29] <BillCriswell> $('html, body, p, a') could also work.
[12:47:33] <systemfault> As for "html, body", it's just a normal CSS selector
[12:48:16] <mouses> ok if i think of it as a css selector, it makes more sense in the syntax but still
[12:48:22] <mouses> seems redundant
[12:48:34] <mouses> there wont be more than one body tag
[12:48:44] <BillCriswell> the html element isn't the body element.
[12:48:45] <mouses> but if its a browser fix, ok, i'll deal with the ugliness
[12:48:45] <systemfault> What?
[12:48:54] <systemfault> Yeah, html is not body
[12:49:15] <mouses> ok redundant is wrong word
[12:49:22] <mouses> seems unnecessary
[12:49:52] <BillCriswell> I want to grow an Amish beard.
[12:50:02] <BillCriswell> You know what... maybe full on ZZ Top.
[12:50:28] <systemfault> Some browser needs html for the scrolling to work... others body
[12:50:43] <systemfault> If you want your scrolling to work on all browsers, you specify both...
[12:50:52] <systemfault> Not sure what's difficult to understand there.
[12:52:52] <rindolf> http://www.shlomifish.org/fc-solve-temp/js-fc-solve/text/ - can anyone tell me why the "Input Freecell layout" p > strong tag floats after the tabs here?
[12:53:32] <mouses> i now understand that its a browser fix. dont act like its all easy to understand at first
[12:53:43] <mouses> thanks for clarifying
[12:54:05] <rindolf> I checked in Opera, chromium-browser and /usr/bin/firefox on Mageia Linux 3 x86-64.
[12:54:32] <BillCriswell> rindolf: You have to clear floats.
[12:54:38] <rindolf> BillCriswell: OK.
[12:55:02] <rindolf> BillCriswell: if I clear: left then it gets displayed after the nav menu to the left.
[12:56:02] <chinoto> aww, my scrollback is filled with cruft now :(
[12:56:09] <rindolf> CSS is such pain.
[12:56:41] <rindolf> Maybe I should convert the page layout to display: table/etc.
[12:56:47] <BillCriswell> #fc_solve_tabs__any_board { width: 100%;  overflow: hidden; }
[12:56:53] <BillCriswell> I think.
[12:56:58] <saedelaere> Whirl3d: ah finally got it. thanks for your hint. Lets see if I can achieve the same behaviour with jQuery $.each
[12:57:01] <rindolf> BillCriswell: let me see.
[12:57:09] <chinoto> note to self: wait for channel lister to finish before closing it
[12:57:53] <greg5green> rindolf: it is out there on the left because it doesnt clear the tabs
[12:58:09] <greg5green> if you want "Input Freecell" to be below the tabs, you need to add more margin
[12:59:01] <chinoto> you know what would be great, if freenode cached the channel list and refreshed it when someone asks for it a minute after the last refresh
[12:59:22] <chinoto> though I dunno how IRC works, so it might not even be possible
[13:01:41] <rindolf> greg5green: fixed now thanks.
[13:01:48] <rindolf> BillCriswell++ # CSS-fu worked.
[13:02:22] <masentinel900> <BillCriswell>: do you have idea what I would have to put in the url?
[13:02:49] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: Literally none.
[13:03:16] <chinoto> is there some way to get the last search result from autocomplete? if not, I guess I could wrap response in an anonymous function and copy the server response to $(this).data('autocomplete').last_source
[13:03:21] <masentinel900> I need pass the data to that controller
[13:04:23] <masentinel900> <BillCriswell>: but do you believe that is well created the script?
[13:04:38] <masentinel900> or is there wrong!!
[13:04:54] <NoiseEee> chinoto: yeah you'll have to cache/record results yourself
[13:05:12] <chinoto> blast
[13:06:04] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: Not sure what you mean really.
[13:06:21] <BillCriswell> The code should work if you get a valid url passed.
[13:06:57] <masentinel900> <BillCriswell>: do you can give me an example of url?
[13:09:19] <BillCriswell> It would be like... /controller/action/id
[13:12:42] <masentinel900> hello MrFox:
[13:21:42] <rindolf> BillCriswell: thanks for your help. Would you like to be credited here - http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/js-fc-solve/text/ ? If so - how and linking to what?
[13:27:30] <BillCriswell> Hey rindolf. I appreciate it but no thanks. Don't have a site or anything haha.
[13:27:37] <BillCriswell> so no need at all.
[13:27:38] <rindolf> BillCriswell: ah, OK.
[13:27:43] <rindolf> BillCriswell: the shoemaker has no shoes.
[13:27:53] <nocturne7> my editor is telling me that accessing DOM like this is inefficient: "$("#someTable tbody")"
[13:27:58] <BillCriswell> Definitely haha.
[13:28:11] <nocturne7> I know jquery works backwards
[13:28:28] <nocturne7> but I think this warning applies to old browsers like IE6-7, right ?
[13:28:51] <NoiseEee> nocturne7: is it telling you that because you've already assigned a variable to $("#someTable") ?
[13:29:22] <BillCriswell> nocturne7: Heh, thought editor was a person.
[13:29:27] <shoky> me too
[13:29:43] <nocturne7> NoiseEee, no, it's not assigned to any variable
[13:29:54] <nocturne7> BillCriswell, I am using IntelliJ :)
[13:30:04] <NoiseEee> nocturne7: meaning in the same function/scope you're in right now, nothing else has reference $('#someTable')?
[13:30:23] <nocturne7> NoiseEee, correct
[13:30:34] <NoiseEee> intelliJ will warn you if you have something like: var a = $('#someTable .class')  and   var b=$('#someTable div')
[13:30:37] <greg5green> that specific selector is relatively inefficient
[13:30:51] <greg5green> tbody would be redundunt in 99% of cases
[13:31:25] <masentinel900> http://pastebin.com/e4GVWyS1
[13:31:30] <masentinel900> And now?
[13:31:40] <nocturne7> greg5green, well, the code is like " $("#someTable tbody").append(columns.join(" "))
[13:32:40] <BillCriswell> That editor sounds like it would piss me off.
[13:33:03] <rindolf> BillCriswell: are you a professional web developer?
[13:33:10] <BillCriswell> rindolf: I often wonder.
[13:33:11] <nocturne7> NoiseEee, I know in those cases it warns as well but if I use find("body"), then it stops warning me
[13:33:14] <rindolf> BillCriswell: heh.
[13:33:16] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: yeah tbh i've turned that part off.  i use a similar IDE, you can shut off jquery 'warnings'
[13:33:32] <rindolf> BillCriswell: do  you get paid for it?
[13:33:39] <BillCriswell> rindolf: Yes.
[13:33:48] <rindolf> BillCriswell: ah, then that's what I meant.
[13:34:01] <rindolf> BillCriswell: are you working for a larger firm?
[13:34:06] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I have 100% interview accuracy!
[13:34:13] <BillCriswell> No, really small. 6 of us.
[13:34:17] <rindolf> Ah.
[13:34:23] <rindolf> BillCriswell: do you have a web site?
[13:34:27] <BillCriswell> I do not.
[13:34:33] <rindolf> BillCriswell: I mean your company.
[13:34:53] <nocturne7> what's a good book to acquire in-depth knowledge of jquery ?
[13:35:04] <BillCriswell> Ohhh, yeah. intuitsolutions.net
[13:35:10] <BillCriswell> I didn't design or anything, though.
[13:35:20] <savid> How do I use plugins like this that are on github?  I just want a minified .js file...  https://github.com/jquery/globalize
[13:36:23] <BillCriswell> Not very happy with the site overall. But I get no time to work on it and my ideas tend to get ignored.
[13:36:44] <nocturne7> ?
[13:37:05] <rindolf> nocturne7: I have “jQuery: Novice to Ninja” but did not want to continue reading the chapters starting from the animations chapter.
[13:37:22] <rindolf> nocturne7: well, I downloaded it for free during the World cup.
[13:37:56] <greg5green> nocturne7, i might recommend a more general javascript book
[13:38:13] <greg5green> once you get the javascript basics down, you should be able to do whatever you need with just consulting the docs at api.jquery.com
[13:38:24] <BillCriswell> I enjoyed this: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[13:38:29] <nocturne7> greg5green, I have in depth knowledge of JS at this point
[13:38:44] <BillCriswell> A lot of the stuff I knew just had no idea what the hell it was called.
[13:38:54] <greg5green> oh, no idea what to recommend then nocturne7
[13:38:57] <nocturne7> I have read books like "Javascript Patterns" and "JavaScript: Good Parts"
[13:39:17] <rindolf> nocturne7: well, I learned most of what I know of jQuery from online resources.
[13:39:19] <greg5green> I was going to tell you this book that my buddy liked, but if you have a really good grasp of js, i fear it mightbe boring
[13:39:39] <greg5green> http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-jQuery-The-Missing-Manual/dp/1449399029/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1357940371&sr=8-2&keywords=javascript+missing+manual
[13:39:47] <nocturne7> I am looking more of a "effecitve jquery" kind of book
[13:39:51] <BillCriswell> I can't find the site that I see linked here often...
[13:39:54] <rindolf> nocturne7: like the jQuery docs, Stackoverflow.com, search engines, #jquery, etc.
[13:39:56] <greg5green> I leafed through it, it is mostly "practical use jquery to build stuff"
[13:40:12] <jlembeck> http://effectivejs.com/
[13:40:23] <jlembeck> that's the best JS book I've read in a long while
[13:40:32] <NoiseEee> nocturne7: i'd be hesitant to get any book about jquery at this point, and focus more on the 1.9 and 2.0 release notes / migration guide / etc
[13:40:54] <nerk> the web is the best book for learning.
[13:41:06] <NoiseEee> yeah, i guess it depends on your learning style
[13:41:08] <BillCriswell> We need a jQuery book to the fashion of _why's poignant guide to ruby
[13:41:24] <NoiseEee> i never found 'manuals' particularly useful for learning.  for reference, sure, but not learning.
[13:41:37] <NoiseEee> everyone is different i guess
[13:41:37] <nocturne7> NoiseEee, I agree
[13:42:00] <nocturne7> I like to read a book that goes into a lot of detail about the topic
[13:42:03] <NoiseEee> nocturne7: just stay on top of http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/  and the 2.0 release.  any jQuery book is soon to be sorely outdated.
[13:42:31] <BillCriswell> I started reading this. It's been pretty awesome so far: http://learnyouahaskell.com/
[13:42:43] <nocturne7> oh, haskell :)
[13:42:45] <systemfault> Won't help you with jQuery ;)
[13:42:50] <greg5green> Only thing I found useful about jQuery books ever when I was first learning was just that they had projects you could work along with
[13:42:55] <NoiseEee> lol @ sun cartoon BillCriswell
[13:42:57] <systemfault> I'm reading "Joy of Clojure" at the moment :P
[13:43:00] <chinoto> huh, didn't expect that $(function(){...}) would run after the page is loaded, nice
[13:43:03] <rindolf> BillCriswell: the site seems fine (front pape at least), but the dark blue section at the top looks a bit cheesy (and reminds me of *.perl.org ), and why does it need to have a constant switch of frame? I'm talking about that - http://www.intuitsolutions.net/ .
[13:43:03] <greg5green> I've always found it easier to learn by doing, and sometimes it's tough to find books
[13:43:05] <greg5green> err
[13:43:09] <greg5green> tough to find projects to do***
[13:43:22] <rindolf> greg5green: I'm a bottom-up learner too.
[13:43:26] <nocturne7> I most jquery books get outdated easily
[13:43:31] <nocturne7> I think*
[13:43:33] <BillCriswell> greg5green: I always need to do something so stupid that I never want to complete it.
[13:43:37] <JonathanNeal> JohnResig: HEY JOHN THIS IS JON YA LIKE CREPES?
[13:43:46] <rindolf> greg5green: I dislike needing to learn too much to get started.
[13:43:57] <JonathanNeal> JohnResig: Anyway, hadn't said hi in a while. <3
[13:44:01] <rindolf> nocturne7: isn't jQuery good about backward-compatibility?
[13:44:14] <NoiseEee> its about to change rindolf
[13:44:20] <rindolf> NoiseEee: it is?
[13:44:25] <NoiseEee> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[13:44:30] <maxpert> does jQuery uses CustomEvent for custom events?
[13:44:36] <BillCriswell> They're ditching legacy IE from what I gather. Exciting.
[13:44:39] <NoiseEee> (@ rindolf)
[13:44:40] <maxpert> i mean the native CustomEvent object?
[13:45:01] <NoiseEee> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate will help backward compatibility for those that need it
[13:45:07] <rindolf> NoiseEee: OK.
[13:45:15] <greg5green> rindolf, yes
[13:45:22] <rindolf> NoiseEee: these don't look like major things that get broken.
[13:45:29] <NoiseEee> rindolf: it depends how old your code is really
[13:45:33] <greg5green> BillCriswell, they are ditching legacy IE from version 2
[13:45:40] <chinoto> it's kinda hard to learn something without giving yourself mini projects to test your knowledge
[13:45:53] <greg5green> version 1.9 will maintain legacy IE and be kept up to date with all advancements made in ver 2
[13:45:53] <rindolf> greg5green: what is legacy IE?
[13:46:03] <chinoto> rindolf: 6
[13:46:06] <rindolf> IE6 and below?
[13:46:08] <rindolf> chinoto: oh.
[13:46:09] <greg5green> like ie 6/7/8
[13:46:16] <systemfault> Legacy is less than 9 IIRC
[13:46:20] <rindolf> So even MSIE 8 won't be supported?
[13:46:27] <systemfault> rindolf: With 1.9
[13:46:30] <rindolf> MSIE 8 is not too bad from my experience.
[13:46:44] <greg5green> i think 2.0 is dropping it, but 1.9 is going to have same features, just with legacy support
[13:46:53] <systemfault> rindolf: Indeed, but it's still a CSS2 browser.. doesn't support things like addEventListener.. etc.
[13:46:55] <rindolf> But I only have a Windows VM with it.
[13:46:56] <chinoto> odd, I wouldn't expect <9 to get dropped
[13:47:04] <rindolf> systemfault: ah.
[13:47:07] <greg5green> IE 8 is a 3 year old browser
[13:47:26] <BillCriswell> I wish there was one amazing browser and that was it.
[13:47:36] <BillCriswell> Competition is good, though.
[13:47:37] <systemfault> greg5green: Blame MS for releasing a browser that was already behind standards at its release.
[13:47:57] <greg5green> I will blame them
[13:48:02] <greg5green> IE9 sucks an awfully big one too
[13:48:22] <maxpert> does jQuery custom events $(…).trigger("foo.bar") use native CustomEvent object
[13:48:23] <maxpert> ?
[13:48:39] <systemfault> Look at the source...
[13:48:41] <chinoto> BillCriswell: I wish browsers would follow standards and make it easier to use an experimental css function across many browsers
[13:48:43] <rindolf> BillCriswell: do you want me to link to http://www.intuitsolutions.net/ ?
[13:48:52] <BillCriswell> rindolf: No thanks.
[13:48:54] <rindolf> BillCriswell: on that page, I mean.
[13:48:54] <greg5green> I'm pretty sure their JS engine is up to date in IE9 but they really dropped the ball with CSS support
[13:48:57] <rindolf> BillCriswell: ah, OK.
[13:49:11] <rindolf> BillCriswell: so your company also does SEO?
[13:49:12] <chinoto> BillCriswell: without browsers competing against eachother, we eventually end up with staleness
[13:49:14] <greg5green> chinoto, the point of experimental css is that it isn't a standard yet :)
[13:49:22] <systemfault> chinoto: You can't follow standards... or else current browser wouldn't support anything interesting.
[13:49:32] <BillCriswell> rindolf: I just work for them. I disagree completely with SEo.
[13:49:34] <BillCriswell> SEO*
[13:50:03] <chinoto> systemfault: why can't you support standards and still have experimental features?
[13:50:38] <greg5green> chinoto, you can, but those experimental features aren't going to work everywhere and could die at any browser update
[13:50:48] <rindolf> BillCriswell: someone once told me that there are two kinds of SEO: those that don't help a lot, and those that can easily get you really penalised by Google/etc..
[13:50:51] <rindolf> BillCriswell: yes.
[13:50:57] <rindolf> BillCriswell: I kinda feel that way too.
[13:51:04] <Gho5t> greg5green: never heard of "Feature Detection" ?
[13:51:07] <Gho5t> bam
[13:51:15] <BillCriswell> I think if it's not helping the user it's absolutely worthless.
[13:51:17] <systemfault> chinoto: Do you think we should have waited for HTML5 to be standardised? We'd still be waiting :/
[13:51:32] <BillCriswell> I care more about usability than anything.
[13:51:34] <Faralla> Hi. I am building in PhoneGap application with jquerymobile. I have a map view on one page (leaflet) with header and footer. Is there a way to determine the height of the content area (the space between header and footer)?
[13:51:43] <rindolf> BillCriswell: yes, so do I.
[13:51:52] <greg5green> Gho5t, feature detection doesn't solve that some of this experimental stuff can't be recreated with a polyfill
[13:51:52] <chinoto> greg5green: my idea is experimental css would use both unprefixed properties and prefixed properties, then when many browsers use the same format for that property, you only need the prefix for a couple odd ones
[13:51:57] <tiphares> what is the preferred method for adding html content? using ".append('<a href="asdasd"><div class="blabla"><img />.....)" or using ".add('a')" then add within that? i would assume the first method is faster, but the latter is cleaner...
[13:51:59] <Faralla> setting height: 100% does not work because im am also including an adMob-Ad which messes with the webView component size
[13:52:03] <nerk> Faralla: first mistae, you are using jquery mobile :P
[13:52:07] <nerk> it will never feel native
[13:52:09] <nerk> mistake rather
[13:52:12] <rindolf> BillCriswell: this is my main site - http://www.shlomifish.org/ - let me know what you think if you have the time/nerve .
[13:52:22] <nerk> but go ahead and spend the time to discover that yourself.
[13:52:32] <nocturne7> some people are saying that we do not need web frameworks thanks to backbone.js or ember.js, what's the validity of these claims ?
[13:52:34] <rindolf> BillCriswell: some people told me the design is a little old-fashioned by now.
[13:52:40] <BillCriswell> tiphares: .add('a') would just add the element to the collection. It wouldn't add html or anything like that.
[13:52:41] <chinoto> systemfault: I don't get the problem, html5 would be an experimental feature
[13:53:03] <BillCriswell> rindolf: Definitely a little old fashoined.
[13:53:10] <BillCriswell> If things are easy to find though, it's still good.
[13:53:31] <rindolf> BillCriswell: BTW, are you using Twitter Bootcamp?
[13:53:39] <BillCriswell> I am not.
[13:53:47] <systemfault> chinoto: The web needs to evolve, we can't wait for bureaucrats to decide that X is ready.
[13:53:51] <rindolf> BillCriswell: many people told me it's great, but I have yet to take a look.
[13:53:51] <systemfault> The w3c can suck it.
[13:54:08] <rindolf> BillCriswell: OK.
[13:54:12] <tiphares> BillCriswell wouldn't the changes still be visible in the browser?
[13:54:12] <Gho5t> greg5green: when you can't polyfill, you can simply not use said feature
[13:54:13] <greg5green> I think we are all saying the same thing in different works systemfault and chinoto
[13:54:29] <systemfault> nocturne7: define web framework
[13:54:32] <chinoto> systemfault: what's your point? are you saying a browser can't follow standards and have experimental features?
[13:54:36] <tiphares> BillCriswell or am i way off in the woods here
[13:54:38] <greg5green> Gho5t: most cases I'm still going to use it if I want ;)
[13:54:50] <rindolf> BillCriswell: well, I hope things are easy to find - I still want to expand the "About Myself", "Work" and "Meta Info" sub-menus by default.
[13:54:53] <systemfault> chinoto: The IE9 is totally standard by that definition.
[13:55:04] <Gho5t> greg5green: ok...
[13:55:15] <Gho5t> original point from you was that it would break on browser updates
[13:55:23] <Gho5t> my point was you can feature detect
[13:55:28] <Gho5t> not sure what you're trying to argue
[13:55:30] <Gho5t> or why
[13:55:31] <BillCriswell> tiphares: Doing .add() wouldn't change anything appearance wise. It would just add another element to a collection.
[13:55:38] <BillCriswell> rindolf: Yeah I need to work on a personal site.
[13:55:50] <nocturne7> systemfault, e.g., spring mvc, play!
[13:55:52] <rindolf> Guest75211: please don't /msg me.
[13:55:53] <BillCriswell> tiphares: $('a, b') === $('a').add('b')
[13:55:57] <rindolf> BillCriswell: yes. :-)
[13:56:02] <Guest75211> ok
[13:56:07] <systemfault> nocturne7: Then where do you get your data from?
[13:56:47] <rindolf> BillCriswell: http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/create-a-great-personal-homesite/rev2.html - that's what I wrote about it, but it may seem like I'm stating the obvious for you.
[13:57:00] <systemfault> nocturne7: You still need a web framework, the difference is that all your "views" are going to be JSON-based instead of HTML
[13:57:18] <BillCriswell> rindolf: Yeah, lots of stuff I take for granted.
[13:57:27] <rindolf> BillCriswell: :-)
[13:58:18] <chinoto> anyway, for anyone wondering why you sometimes can't get $ to work in firefox web console, see this https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621644
[13:58:36] <nocturne7> systemfault, I just read it on some blogs
[13:58:38] <chinoto> was making me go nuts trying to debug it
[14:00:12] <nocturne7> systemfault, so, with that approach, people are getting data as JSON and building the html in JS code, right ?
[14:00:36] <nocturne7> systemfault, you can get your JSON data just using a REST API like JAX-RS
[14:00:38] <systemfault> nocturne7: Yes, usually from html templates
[14:00:44] <systemfault> nocturne7: Exactly.
[14:00:48] <Guest75211> can any of you mod the jquery ui autocomplete
[14:01:04] <nocturne7> systemfault, so why would I need the Play framework here?
[14:01:29] <systemfault> nocturne7: You don't really need it... JAX-RS is still a framework though..
[14:01:59] <nocturne7> yeah, it's but not in the same category with spring mc, wicket, or play :) that's what I meant
[14:02:06] <systemfault> You still have your routes... your controllers, your domain.
[14:02:14] <systemfault> Where the difference?
[14:02:49] <nocturne7> yeah, that part is the same
[14:04:14] <nocturne7> there's a lot of diferrence between a framework like Play and JAX-RS. Play offers much beyond what JAX-RS does.
[14:05:53] <greg5green> Gho5t: if your experimental feature's syntax changes in the future, what good is the feature detection? You don't know the future syntax in most cases so you end up having to rewrite it in the future anyways
[14:06:33] <greg5green> for example: flex box
[14:06:47] <greg5green> how many times have there been major changes to flexbox's syntax?
[14:06:48] <greg5green> 3 times?
[14:07:10] <Gho5t> no idea
[14:07:15] <Gho5t> haven't run into any issues with that
[14:07:20] <chinoto> Guest75211: your goal?
[14:07:39] <greg5green> now css3 gradients, no worries there
[14:07:48] <greg5green> (even with that switch webkit did 1.5 years ago)
[14:07:49] <Gho5t> you're saying that in one particular browser, the syntax for using flexbox changed 3 times over the course of a couple of years?
[14:08:07] <greg5green> flexbox is an "experimental" feature
[14:08:24] <greg5green> the "decided upon" syntax was implemented
[14:08:35] <greg5green> then that syntax was changed
[14:08:56] <greg5green> (obviously not every browser implemented, but I believe both webkit and mozilla did)
[14:09:03] <chinoto> Guest75211: most likely you wont have to muck with the original autocomplete function
[14:09:52] <greg5green> If I remember correctly, they had the original syntax, then changed it up a lot to an alternative syntax, and then went back to a slightly adjusted version of the original syntax that wasn't too different from the original but still wasn't compatible
[14:10:15] <greg5green> If you had used it on anything but a tech demo, you would have been rebuilding your finished project
[14:12:53] <BillCriswell> http://janne.aukia.com/zoomooz/ pretty fun
[14:14:41] <ogk1000> anyone know if its possible to have html5 video as a site backround on a mobile site? when my site loads it just plays the video separate... any ideas?
[14:16:24] <BillCriswell> ogk1000: http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/ maybe?
[14:17:01] <NoiseEee> wow BillCriswell, cooool
[14:17:02] <chinoto> ogk1000: maybe you could set the video element to position:fixed and play with width/z-index
[14:17:27] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: People are doing so much fun shit.
[14:17:31] <nzee> I am getting 'Object has no method prepend' Can some one have a look http://jsfiddle.net/SEMES/
[14:17:55] <BillCriswell> While I'm trying to fix this absurdly fucked database.
[14:18:04] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: yeah looking at that i got a brief glimpse into the web a couple of years fromw now
[14:18:29] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Yeah, hopefully not TOO much of this, but definitely some.
[14:18:50] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: straight to recreation of MySpace but with video!!!
[14:18:56] <NoiseEee> and geoCities!
[14:19:12] <BillCriswell> I remember my geocities page.
[14:20:02] <BillCriswell> I was so cool.
[14:22:39] <Guest75211> chinoto can you give me the steps to do what i want
[14:23:29] <chinoto> Guest75211: I have no idea what you want -_-
[14:24:29] <Guest75211> its like myspace only that the four fields are replaced for @yahoo,@gmail,@aol,@hotmail
[14:25:08] <nzee> someone help me with this error please. "Uncaught TypeError, object has no method prepend" http://jsfiddle.net/SEMES/
[14:26:02] <chinoto> Guest75211: I barely used myspace
[14:26:26] <BillCriswell> nzee: .text() returns a string, it has no prepend.
[14:26:36] <Guest75211> you dont need to login its on the main page
[14:26:48] <Guest75211> that autocomplete function
[14:26:51] <greg5green> nzee: works if you load jquery via jsfiddle instead of loading it via script tag there ;p
[14:26:51] <greg5green> http://jsfiddle.net/SEMES/1/
[14:28:20] <ogk1000> chinoto, when I do that it still opens in the video app
[14:28:31] <nzee> yes greg5green. So you think the prob is with the version of jQuery?
[14:28:47] <greg5green> yes
[14:28:52] <greg5green> well, idk really
[14:29:11] <greg5green> just saying that if you load 1.8.2 via jsfiddle or even if you change your script tag to 1.8.2, it works...
[14:29:49] <BillCriswell> Night dudes.
[14:30:41] <greg5green> still, a pretty complicated selector/chaining
[14:30:43] <chinoto> I got a headache...
[14:30:47] <greg5green> could simplify that a bit
[14:35:14] <chinoto> I found out how to get the last autocomplete search result ヽ(´▽`)/
[14:35:20] <nzee> greg5green: well.. 1.8.2 works fine. Thanks!
[14:35:48] <chinoto> $('.ui-autocomplete-input').map(function() {return [$(this).data('autocomplete').widget().find('li').map(function() {return $(this).data('uiAutocompleteItem')}).get()]}).get()
[14:48:57] <djshotglass> i cant find the .wait() docs
[14:50:04] <ENeves> Algum Brasileiro ?
[14:50:10] <greg5green> wait?
[14:50:13] <greg5green> I only know of delay
[14:50:40] <greg5green> and thats only for the effects queue
[14:54:11] <thinboy> Hi, I'm using hammer.js to add swipe functionality to my slideshow. Right now each swipe has a fix width? How to make it stop at the middle of swipe?
[14:56:11] <thinboy> Is there a way to make my slideshow stop at the middle of swipe? I'm using hammer.js
[14:56:49] <otherj> perhaps you should mention again what you're using, because I think we might not have seen it
[14:58:25] <iaj> Hi there - does someone have a good example on how to reach a, well... snow-flake-ish effect?
[14:59:06] <otherj> iaj, did you google for 'jquery snowflake' at all?
[14:59:16] <otherj> because I found about 3,400,000 pages
[14:59:49] <thinboy> otherj have you tried hammer.js?
[15:00:40] <iaj> well... time back y... but had no success with what I found, so I hoped for someone to guide me to a nice thing:)
[15:02:10] <iaj> hm otherj its more an effect of ONE element that should fly into its position like a snowflake:)
[15:02:35] <JesperA> Is it just me or does document.title = "i love camels"; have horrible performance? It increase the page loadtime by 3-4x for me
[15:04:48] <otherj> thinboy: nope. i've been using sequence lately
[15:06:22] <thinboy> Does it stop in the middle of your swipe? Ex: I swipe in the middle of image. I need something like that.
[15:06:37] <thinboy> otherj:  Does it stop in the middle of your swipe? Ex: I swipe in the middle of image. I need something like that.
[15:07:51] <otherj> i have no idea what you mean
[15:07:52] <Guest75211> ok im completely lost where is the link to download the autocomplete ui
[15:09:16] <BinaryKitten> Guest75211 if you want only the autocomplete
[15:09:38] <BinaryKitten> then you need to go to http://jqueryui.com and build a custom version
[15:13:21] <Guest75211> ok why isnt the hackground showing up
[15:13:27] <Guest75211> background
[15:22:16] <defaultro> am I complaining too much? Or should I just keep quiet? I was a designer before so I know more than basics. My manager assigned some backend guys to work on frontend work. I've already noticed 3 issues this morning about layout and it's crap.
[15:23:06] <Engin> is there an easy way to retrieve the list of objects between foo>bar and faz>baz ? considering foo and faz are two consecutive containers
[15:24:00] <Hans_Henrik> fooElement.getElementsByName  or whatever..
[15:24:19] <Hans_Henrik> lal nvm
[15:24:38] <Hans_Henrik> (mixed "objects" with "elements" x.x)
[16:01:33] <thinboy> Anyone knows something exactly like hammer.js that has a horizontal scroll?
[16:04:47] <fwaokda> I'm trying to pass alot of text to another page via a jquery ajax call/function... is there a max character limit? When i do small text sizes it works but when i do something large i get an error in my google chrome console saying... 404 file not found
[16:06:12] <nerk> there is a max limit to a get request yes
[16:06:55] <nerk> this stack overflow might help
[16:06:55] <nerk> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2659952/maximum-length-of-http-get-request
[16:07:19] <nerk> however, I don't believe it would say 404 file not found
[16:07:27] <nerk> sounds to me that you have the URL malformed
[16:08:24] <fwaokda> malformed? like there is a special character goofing it up?
[16:08:46] <nerk> show me the URL? feel free to message it
[16:09:57] <nerk> is it purely a html/js project.  you could use something to encode the request as you might just have some encoding issues with the string being passed
[16:10:31] <nerk> I believe JS's escape function also does the same thing
[16:12:09] <tiphares> what is the preferred way of achiveing this? https://pastee.org/tm4jn ; atm i add all tags then i add the content and specifics afterwards, but it just seems hacky..
[16:12:38] <fwaokda> nerk, im using this function to encode... encodeURIComponent
[16:21:43] <nerk> ok
[16:21:56] <nerk> right.. encodeURIComponent is what you would want.. not escape
[16:21:59] <nerk> my apologies
[17:05:49] <nocturne7> do you think it's a bad practice to use '$'  at the beginning of jquery variable names ?
[17:05:57] <nocturne7> it makes it clear to me that this is a jquery object

[17:16:29] <pzuraq> hey
[17:16:41] <pzuraq> I'm having a problem with slideDown
[17:17:32] <pzuraq> if I activate it multiple times quickly, it gets caught and then only slides down part way
[17:17:41] <pzuraq> I've tried using stop(true, true) but that's not working

[17:20:35] <tds5016> hi all. for some reason on mobile safari.... wehn I run .blur() on a textentry field, it does not lose focus....
[17:20:41] <tds5016> the focus stays on the text entry.
[17:21:00] <tds5016> is there a reason why/how do I cause a text entry to not be in focus on mobile safari
[17:21:59] <snover> why is because mobile safari is broken
[17:22:22] <snover> how is you can attempt to focus something else, but depending upon the combination you are using you may simply end up with a broken virtual keyboard
[17:24:45] <tds5016> snover: basically I have a rboken virtual keyboard as is :-/.
[17:24:50] <coldhead> dlam: sure
[17:25:02] <pzuraq> coldhead: The problem is specifically when I rollover the element, leave, and then roll back, it doesn't slideDown.
[17:25:05] <snover> tds5016: welcome to mobile safari!
[17:25:22] <tds5016> mobile safari can suck it :-)
[17:25:39] <coldhead> there are a lot of different solutions, pzuraq. that page i linked has just a few
[17:25:52] <tds5016> is there something else I can force it to focus on?
[17:25:56] <tds5016> that isn't a form element?
[17:26:45] <pzuraq> yeah, I'm using it, stop(true, true), stop(true, false) both aren't working. That's how I've solved the problem before, at least.
[17:27:55] <owzim> Please tell me why this is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/qKj9e/
[17:40:57] <pzuraq> ha, got it!
[17:41:16] <pzuraq> Was applying a different .stop to the element on accident
[17:41:22] <pzuraq> it's working with true, true now
[17:51:12] <oreth> is it possible to query data from other cells using DataTables?
[17:58:37] <fwaokda> $('#Info').load("maintain.aspx?FieldName=" + FieldName + "&Value=" + Value.toString() + "&" + strInterviewInfo)
[17:58:40] <fwaokda> err sry
[17:58:50] <fwaokda> If im using this line of code... -- $('#Info').load("maintain.aspx?FieldName=" + FieldName + "&Value=" + Value.toString() + "&" + strInterviewInfo) -- how can i make it act as a post and not a get ?
[18:05:13] <otters> I see from the docs that live() is deprecated in favor of on(), but on() doesn't appear to trigger events for elements which match its selector that have been added to the DOM

[18:08:29] <tds5016> hey. is there a good way to change the draggable's parent after the draggable has already been instantiated?
[18:09:16] <tds5016> or what a draggable is appended to ?
[18:09:37] <tds5016> basically when I'm in a given state, I want to block from being able to drag an element from out of the div it's in.
[18:11:26] <shoky> you mean the bounds of the div?
[18:11:39] <shoky> if so see containment option
[18:46:57] <JBlitzen> I would like to track some invisible data about divs on a page.  I have a javascript function that knows what the div ID's are.  Is there a way I can associate a hidden (or something?) attribute with them?
[18:47:34] <JBlitzen> Worst case I suppose I could create a string indexed array of structs or something
[18:47:53] <JBlitzen> I'm planning a single-page web application
[18:48:02] <JBlitzen> And it has a bunch of different objects shown on the page at once
[18:48:17] <JBlitzen> And some interactions with objects should trigger a refresh of server data via ajax
[18:48:41] <JBlitzen> I'd like to collect that behavior into a single "update" function
[18:49:06] <JBlitzen> Thus each interaction function would flag some affected object (or objects) for updating, and then call "update()"
[18:49:31] <JBlitzen> But I'm not sure how to associate an invisible flag like that with a div, except via hidden input tags or something
[18:49:44] <JBlitzen> I'm not sure any of this is a good idea, but I want to explore it before I dismiss it
[18:55:11] <JBlitzen> Oh
[18:55:12] <JBlitzen> That was easy
[18:55:13] <JBlitzen> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[18:58:06] <JBlitzen> I think I will dismiss that idea
[18:58:19] <JBlitzen> Doesn't seem like it would reduce the complexity
[18:58:38] <JBlitzen> I'll just have some save/load functions and make sure I call them in init or something.
[19:00:19] <smpa> is it possible to write one callback to two different ajax calls
[19:00:40] <smpa> I want to execute this callback only after the two ajax calls succeed

[19:01:31] <oshiwoshy> look at nimble.js
[19:01:48] <oshiwoshy> i've also heard flow.js takes care of similar things

[20:35:03] <hugo_moss> hi
[20:35:58] <rakl> what does this syntax do: $(':checked[type=checkbox]',$('#partners-form')) ?
[20:38:04] <hugo_moss> selects all checked checkmark boxes in the form with id partners-form?
[20:39:33] <rakl> hugo_moss that's what I guessed, but I wasn't sure. never used that second argument syntax
[20:39:48] <hugo_moss> im not sure either
[20:39:51] <hugo_moss> i just made a guess
[20:39:55] <shoky> rakl: it does $('#partners-form').find(':checked[type=checkbox]')
[20:39:59] <hugo_moss> i never used that second argument syntax either
[20:40:06] <hugo_moss> good to know
[20:40:21] <rakl> cool thanks shoky
[20:41:22] <hugo_moss> what made you stumble upon that selector rakl
[20:42:03] <rakl> reading code my coworker wrote because we all went home because something exploded outside our building and power went out
[20:42:10] <rakl> or i would have just asked him :P
