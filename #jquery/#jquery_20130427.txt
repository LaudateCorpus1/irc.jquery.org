[00:04:21] <harpal_> I am trying to according with hover. Here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/2Kjr2/ it has only problem that if mouse over to multiple element that it start animating which looks ungly and some time it ends in to infinite loop. Can anyone have any solution to this?
[00:07:22] <kongyang_> 		function replaceURLWithHTMLLinks(text) {
[00:07:22] <kongyang_> 		    var exp = /(\b(https?|ftp|file):\/\/[-A-Z0-9+&@#\/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-A-Z0-9+&@#\/%=~_|])/ig;
[00:07:22] <kongyang_> 		    return text.replace(exp,"<a href='$1' type='url'>$1</a>");
[00:07:22] <kongyang_> 		}
[00:07:22] <kongyang_> This only match english words, how could I match utf8 encoded string?
[00:23:33] <iliketurtles__> Say I have four <li> elements that are height:100%, and take up width:25% each of the entire document window.  If I wanted to use jQuery-UI resizable() to resize these elements, how can I ensure that their width always adds up to 100%?  Such that, if I shrink one of the elements' width, an adjacent element makes up for it?
[00:24:59] <antiPoP> ravenzz: check this http://redsun2.freehostia.com/aar_form.php
[00:25:22] <antiPoP> write some lines in the text area, save the form , then load it
[00:27:02] <antiPoP> (if somebody else wants to take a look he's free to do so).
[00:36:24] <antiPoP> nobody?
[00:36:33] <iliketurtles__> can anyone tell me how I can have the <li> elements here always fill 100% of the page when you resize them? http://jsfiddle.net/kVwRC/6/

[01:16:24] <rweng> hi guys. I am wondering: Bootstrap and jquery ui seem to expose plugin methods through function arguments to the plugin: $().carousel('next'), $().carousel('pause'), â€¦ What is the advantage over adding the methods directly to the dom like described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1034306/public-functions-from-within-a-jquery-plugin - how would you write getters in the bootstrap/jui way? Does anyone have good references regarding this to

[01:58:30] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have downloaded a jquery plugin (http://welldonethings.com/tags/manager) to show words as tags. That works but when i want to put it in a dialog it doesn't work anymore... What can i do to find the solution??
[02:10:47] <Krambiorix> anyone???
[02:31:31] <Krambiorix> i want to call  $(".tagManager1").tagsManager({..... but the tagsManager code is defined in the parent frame... How can i call it?
[02:59:31] <zissou> i created some buttons with a button. now my on click event doesnt work
[03:01:45] <zissou> should i rather create them on document ready and keep them hidden. so later i will reveal them with a button
[03:08:18] <blouf> hi
[03:08:22] <blouf> anyone there ?
[03:08:57] <screamingbanshee> :)
[03:09:24] <blouf> uf i neeed help
[03:10:46] <blouf> i'm using wordpress+slider in javascript. i added a ajaxify plugin but it stops the slider sliding. i've searched, it seems i need to reload jquery, but just can't figure how
[03:14:41] <screamingbanshee> ok in wordpress that is a bit tricky
[03:21:40] <blouf> screamingbanshee ???
[03:30:34] <jop008> anyone tip on this https://forum.jquery.com/topic/table-refresh#14737000004090587
[03:31:16] <jop008> Is there a way to refresh the whole page?
[03:31:53] <screamingbanshee> location.reload()
[03:33:07] <jop008> is this expansive looking at performance
[03:33:07] <jop008> when I do a reload my page will start building up the table again using ajax
[03:33:16] <jop008> so this is not the way I want it
[03:35:53] <screamingbanshee> Ok, you'd have to be much more specific than "is there a way to refresh the whole page" lol
[03:46:16] <jop008> Solution found  $("#tbody").trigger("create"); within my ajax result call
[03:47:45] <darkmutt> hi guys
[03:47:54] <darkmutt> any idea as to why nesting accordion's does not work ??
[04:17:16] <zissou> how to create an event on elements that themselves get created after the document has loaded
[04:18:26] <zissou> should i use ajax to load a script?
[04:18:48] <screamingbanshee> Were the elements added to the dom?
[04:19:13] <zissou> yes, but with an event
[04:20:14] <zissou> as far as i can tell jquery doesnt listens to elements that werent loaded upon document ready
[04:21:22] <zissou> so if i write an event for an element that's about to get created by another element, that function wont do anything
[04:21:31] <screamingbanshee> no, it won't
[04:21:47] <zissou> so, what do you recommend?
[04:21:48] <screamingbanshee> because the element needs to exist in order for an event to be bound to it
[04:22:09] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/zAwah/
[04:22:30] <screamingbanshee> ^ just like that
[04:22:48] <screamingbanshee> add it to the dom (append and prepend manipulate the dom, for example)
[04:23:33] <zissou> when exactly does that button get appended? after 1000ms?
[04:24:04] <screamingbanshee> no
[04:24:08] <zissou> so page loads->timeout(1sec)->button appended->event bound
[04:24:15] <Eviltwin> Yes
[04:24:37] <zissou> how bout binding an event to a button that gets created itself by another event?
[04:24:48] <Eviltwin> Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/cusf6/
[04:25:05] <screamingbanshee> lol
[04:25:20] <screamingbanshee> moooooar
[04:25:56] <zissou> sry, i was a bit vague, by 'another event' i mean a click on another btton
[04:26:02] <zissou> not timeout
[04:26:07] <Eviltwin> Click the button
[04:26:17] <zissou> oh
[04:26:20] <screamingbanshee> lol
[04:26:20] <zissou> ok =)
[04:26:52] <ankur> hello
[04:26:56] <zissou> tyvm ;)

[04:50:34] <chachan> hey guys, yesterday I was asking something but I lost connection. Here I go again:
[04:50:34] <chachan> guys, I'm getting a list of objects through $.ajax(dataType: "json").responseText. What's the best way to retrieve all this information?
[04:53:50] <jimi_> chachan, is it a json object?
[04:54:09] <jimi_> chachan, if so, you could potentially do $.each( json, ..... ) { }
[04:54:22] <chachan> jimi_, yes, otherwise I would get an exception
[04:54:29] <chachan> jimi_, I tried that
[04:54:52] <chachan> but when I do typeof it realized out that it's a string
[04:55:02] <chachan> let me paste it
[04:55:12] <jimi_> make a fiddle real quick
[04:55:28] <chachan> sure :)
[04:55:34] <jimi_> oh
[04:55:44] <jimi_> maybe you need to do JSON.parse( x ) first?
[04:57:59] <chachan> jimi_, I tried it with a jQuery plugin but it just eval the first hierarchy level, next level is a string
[04:58:07] <chachan> is that JSON a library?
[04:58:28] <chachan> jimi_, http://jsfiddle.net/2jbB8/ < something like this
[04:58:39] <chachan> and I get "string"
[04:59:10] <chachan> https://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/
[04:59:14] <chachan> I tried with that
[05:00:30] <chachan> and it's able to loop through the list of objects, but next level (the objects) are not objects at all, just string, I tried to eval them again and there was a parsing error because it found ' and not "
[05:00:58] <jimi_> try result = JSON.parse(response);   console.log ( typeof(result) );
[05:01:23] <chachan> where do I found that JSON thing?, is it native?
[05:01:38] <jimi_> yes
[05:02:04] <chachan> awesome, I didn't know it
[05:02:08] <jimi_> ;)
[05:03:24] <chachan> jimi_, that worked, thanks!
[05:03:59] <chachan> is that a jQuery native feature or is it a JavaScript built-in one?
[05:03:59] <jimi_> chachan, :)
[05:04:13] <jimi_> native to js
[05:04:19] <chachan> great
[05:04:22] <chachan> thx
[05:10:10] <jimi_> chachan, n/p ... what are you building?
[05:10:54] <chachan> jimi_, I have a select with a list of countries and I want to query a web services to populate the list of regions (states, provinces)
[05:11:12] <jimi_> chachan, do you have a database backend?
[05:11:23] <chachan> jimi_, yes, I have everything already
[05:11:37] <jimi_> chachan, if you were a bad ass, you iterate through all the combinations, and cache them into a database table, and not call the webservice anymore :D
[05:12:05] <myndzi> how is that badass other than hammering their servers? :P
[05:12:17] <myndzi> better would be to simply cache them as you get them
[05:12:17] <jimi_> myndzi++
[05:12:36] <jimi_> true
[05:12:42] <jimi_> check for a local copy first, else hit their server
[05:12:44] <myndzi> heh, i'm actually doing something similar with a geocoding api
[05:12:49] <jimi_> i did
[05:12:50] <jimi_> lol
[05:12:54] <myndzi> it's harder there because i'm feeding user-based text to it
[05:12:58] <myndzi> but i cache what i can
[05:13:10] <myndzi> and i can do the conversion from gps coords to timezone region locally
[05:13:13] <jimi_> I needed to get zipcode / lat /lon values across the USA..... so i did that
[05:14:21] <chachan> we have few users (no more than 20) and this is going to be a no-more-than-2-times form, so I wouldn't like to spend so much time to save things than nobody will care
[05:14:42] <chachan> but I'll take it in mind when I build something that requires it :)
[05:31:20] <zergion_> I have a bunch of divs with the same class and I wanna scroll through them. How can I select only the first div?
[05:33:02] <spycrab0> hi i have the following problem if i want to use .live() it says that live is no function(Btw i'm using jQuery 1.4.4)
[05:36:00] <sacho_> why are you using a version as old as ie7?
[05:36:09] <spycrab0> i i have the following problem if i want to use .live() it says that live is no function(Btw i'm using jQuery 1.4.4)
[05:50:25] <jimi_> zergion_, $('.someclass')[0].innerHTML
[05:53:57] <zergion_> jimi_ am using eq. That is cool
[05:55:10] <jimi_> zergion_, what do you mean? im sorry
[05:57:25] <zergion_> .eq(id)
[06:01:31] <gumble> any idea why the position of my div moves about 20 px upwards when I include the jquery library??
[06:02:56] <papachan> can i trigger $.event from any object to local?
[06:03:54] <gumble> not my div I mean my section
[06:06:24] <darkmutt> grahhh why can't i use multiple accordion levels :/
[06:06:55] <darkmutt> wouldn't gumble if you hadn't done something ffor it i have jquery lib too ;p
[06:09:24] <gumble> darkmutt, I'm sure it does. and I also know that I don't have any javascript in the project until now. I am including the script and when I reload the page the section which is normally centered slides up about 50px
[06:11:40] <darkmutt> so there HAS to be something in the script either way without the code i don't really see a chance to help you
[06:12:34] <Ungy> I am trying to add classes to option tags based on their value I tried doing an if on contains to no luck
[06:12:52] <Ungy> if($('select.codereviewanswer option:contains("(/)")')) $(this).addClass('pass');
[06:14:05] <gumble> darkmutt, I am including it from google
[06:14:51] <darkmutt> gumble, i need to see your code preferably in jsfiddle.net or something alike
[06:16:41] <gumble> darkmutt, what code? I am only including jquery. I don't have any javascript or jquery code in my project until now. I have a section which displays a small box and is centered. when including the official jquery from the google api and afterwards reloading the page, the section slides up about 50 px as if it would be animated
[06:17:03] <darkmutt> listen gumble  how am i supposed to check what might be the problem without seeing the code at all?
[06:17:13] <darkmutt> and if what you say is true then there's no way that's possible
[06:18:11] <Ungy> ahh an each with a fi on val did the trick
[06:18:19] <gumble> just really don't understand which code you want. yes its not possible at all. I can upload my html and css if it could help
[06:18:46] <gumble> I am including this library: ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js
[06:20:42] <darkmutt> gumble,  either you give me a sample of what of the code on YOUR SITE is causing the problem that is html css and anything else there is
[06:20:47] <darkmutt> or hteres no chance to help you

[06:58:36] <lolmaus> Hi! Is there a tool for moving elements in DOM depending on window width?

[08:34:17] <lord4163> Hello
[08:35:13] <lord4163> I'm trying out jQuery Mobile, but why do I have a bar which says loading, and all the content is in a box it seems, so there is padding on all sides?
[08:40:14] <lord4163> I fixed it awesome! :_)
[09:07:59] <lord4163> How can I use innerHTML in jQuery Mobile?
[09:08:52] <rindolf> lord4163: hi.
[09:08:58] <rindolf> lord4163: doesn't .content() work?
[09:10:17] <lord4163> rindolf: Have been using bare javascript, so maybe I'll have to use jquery instead :D
[09:10:51] <rindolf> lord4163: ah.
[09:11:11] <rindolf> lord4163: http://api.jquery.com/html/ - see this.
[09:16:13] <lord4163> rindolf: It looks more, but it is much smaller than the other items in the list and has no icons :(
[09:17:09] <rindolf> lord4163: what?
[09:17:52] <lord4163> rindolf: I didn't say anything :D
[09:18:15] <lord4163> thanks!
[09:21:18] <BillCriswell> lord4163: .html() should do the job.
[09:21:27] <BillCriswell> I was disconnected... no idea what I missed.
[09:21:27] <rindolf> lord4163: <lord4163> rindolf: It looks more, but it is much smaller than the other items in the list and has no icons :(
[09:21:33] <lord4163> rindolf: Can I do something like this? $('a.ui-link-inherit[0]').html("blablabla");
[09:21:46] <BillCriswell> lord4163: :eq(0)
[09:21:55] <BillCriswell> instead of [0]
[09:22:07] <rindolf> lord4163: yes, you can.
[09:22:38] <rindolf> There's also :first , right?
[09:22:48] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:22:55] <lord4163> Oh, but I get a syntax error :(
[09:22:59] <BillCriswell> or :first, or .eq(0)
[09:23:27] <BillCriswell> $('a.ui-link-inherit:eq(1)') might actually be what you want.
[09:23:40] <BillCriswell> Can't stop with indexes starting at 0.
[09:24:18] <lord4163> Thanks again guys, amazing, $('a.ui-link-inherit').eq(0).html("afjoajf"); was the solution :)
[09:24:22] <BillCriswell> Err.. it is 0.
[09:24:27] <andrewSC> hey guise, I'm trying to do a simple enter-button to trigger a form submission and I don't like the solution of binding an event to a specific key to trigger the submission. Is there a better way to do this?
[09:24:47] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: The browser does this by default.
[09:25:36] <andrewSC> hmmmm
[09:25:59] <andrewSC> BillCriswell: it seems my js function isn't firing when i press the enter button though?
[09:26:12] <andrewSC> well no, that's a lie.
[09:26:14] <andrewSC> let me check
[09:26:50] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: Ok. I haven't been doing this a 1/3 of my life so I'm not positive.
[09:27:15] <andrewSC> BillCriswell: alright, so the js fires, but something isn't working. I'll investigate some more
[09:27:21] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: Ok.
[09:27:22] <andrewSC> thanks tho
[09:27:25] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[09:28:50] <BillCriswell> If you post some code I'd be happy to help.
[09:29:16] <BillCriswell> Drinking in a bar waiting for my girlfriend to get done her hair and messing around with some code currently haha
[09:29:53] <andrewSC> BillCriswell: so here's the weirdest thing, it now works.....
[09:30:00] <andrewSC> both on enter and button submit
[09:30:08] <andrewSC> this must have been a caching issue or something
[09:30:34] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: Were you waiting for a click on the submit button? That's a mistake a lot of people I see make.
[09:31:04] <andrewSC> nah
[09:31:11] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[09:31:13] <andrewSC> the snippet couldn't have been simpler
[09:31:59] <andrewSC> BillCriswell: https://gist.github.com/andrewSC/5473681 where email = my email address (string)
[09:32:35] <BillCriswell> Ah, yeah. No idea how that could have went wrong.
[09:33:01] <andrewSC> right?
[09:33:06] * andrewSC shrugs
[09:34:23] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: Was it a part of a larger code base or strictly that?
[09:34:49] <andrewSC> well, strictly that for the form submission piece
[09:34:53] <andrewSC> the html is equally as simple
[09:35:49] <BillCriswell> I was thinking more in terms of javascript.
[09:38:06] <andrewSC> the squaresend?
[09:38:41] <BillCriswell> No, just wondering if there was like, something preventing the default action on keyup or something weird.
[09:38:51] <andrewSC> oh no haha
[09:39:40] <andrewSC> BillCriswell: that's the entire block after ready() is fired on the DOM https://gist.github.com/andrewSC/5473718
[09:40:40] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[09:40:59] <BillCriswell> It takes women way too long to get their hair done. Feeling these beers already.
[09:41:40] <andrewSC> all the better ;)
[09:42:05] <BillCriswell> That's true.
[09:42:24] <andrewSC> tell her she looks beautiful when you see her... She's not burning your time because she is trying to piss you off, she's burning your time because she's not confident in the way she is looking/dressed
[09:42:38] <andrewSC> and wants you to be happy with how she looks ;))
[09:43:50] <BillCriswell> Oh I know. I have no problem with it. Just didn't plan on being a little tipsy before 1pm.
[09:43:55] <andrewSC> haha
[09:45:16] <BillCriswell> I don't mind hanging out at all. This is her first time coming to this one and she doesn't know her way around here that well.
[09:45:54] <sacho> What
[09:46:02] <BillCriswell> sacho: Say whatttt
[09:46:13] <sacho> Glancing over this conversation is confusing
[09:46:15] <BillCriswell> sacho: Why are you in here on the weekend? What a dork.
[09:46:23] <sacho> It's work weekend, of course
[09:46:29] <BillCriswell> Oh.... Shit.
[09:46:38] <sacho> code doesn't refactor itself
[09:47:18] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to make the switch to Sublime Text 2.
[09:47:29] <BillCriswell> TextMate has been so good to me though... but I think it's dead.
[09:51:12] <jop008> <select name= how can I make an onclick action?
[09:52:23] <BillCriswell> jop008: Might have to use .on('change', fn);
[09:53:14] <jop008> oke not with $().click
[09:53:24] <jop008> i have non unique ids on this item
[09:53:38] <jop008> mutliple selects on a page
[09:54:18] <BillCriswell> jop008: Ok.
[09:54:47] <BillCriswell> You can select it by a parent if you need to.. or a class name?
[09:54:57] <BillCriswell> Also, if you have non--unique ids get it fixed.
[09:55:16] <BillCriswell> It'll lead to headaches.
[09:55:45] <Krambiorix> Hi, can someone help me with this autocomplete thingy? http://jsfiddle.net/jF9Mj/4/
[10:00:00] <lord4163> Got a question again :D I am wanting to create one list item in jQuery Mobile for each loop, I thought something like this but does not really wants to work http://pastie.org/7729696 :(
[10:02:34] <BillCriswell> lord4163: This might be easier as a string.
[10:03:16] <lord4163> Like how?
[10:04:04] <BillCriswell> var li = '<li><a href="' + item.link + '" class="ui-link-inherit">' + item.name + '</a>'; $('ul').append(li);
[10:08:07] <lord4163> Good, but now it doesn't work with jQuery Mobile
[10:08:27] <BillCriswell> I forgot to close the </li>.
[10:08:40] <BillCriswell> That should work with jQuery mobile. No idea why it wouldn/t
[10:09:42] <BillCriswell> Any error or anything?
[10:10:09] <jop008> is there a closest function downwards in the DOM?
[10:10:47] <BillCriswell> jop008: There's children() which will get the very first children.
[10:10:55] <BillCriswell> find() goes infinitely deep.
[10:21:32] <lord4163> Sorry guys had power cut...
[10:27:43] <jop008> if I have a DOM element how can I convert it to a jquery object $?
[10:28:25] <lord4163> And now Opera crashed :D
[10:32:49] <faraway> how can i link to a specific source part of the jquery src (i know that i have seen this somewhere) ? it is just for a reference not for coding
[10:33:41] <faraway> nevermind mind found it right now :D
[10:44:50] <lord4163> I don't get it guys, how do I create an element in jQuery Mobile USING jQuery?
[10:45:40] <andkore> so what is the preferred way of loading dynamic content using .load()? like, if I want to load something other than plain html, like php
[10:50:43] <lord4163> anyone?
[10:51:36] <kimvlf> so I have an multiple li's, inside are spans with class selected and then also an image (submit). I am looking to create a click function that is specific to the contents of the li that the image is clicked in. Example: click image inside li, get text of span class="selected" inside the same li that the image is in (this will be replicated, so it needs to know the specific li that the image is in to look at)
[10:56:58] <lord4163> I don't get it guys, how do I create an element in jQuery Mobile USING jQuery?
[11:05:19] <jop008> if ( children2[0].tagName == "SELECT") { select = children2[0];select.selectedIndex = 0;$select = $(select);$select.trigger("create");}
[11:05:42] <jop008> but my select is not refreshed with the new off value
[11:05:57] <jop008> with console I can see it has the new value
[11:12:28] <zuloyd> hi
[11:13:08] <zuloyd> is it possible to store the HTML of a DOM element and then restore it later while also restoring the CSS attributes that have been altered using $(myObject).css ?
[11:13:58] <zuloyd> I mean the complete HTML contained within the DOM elemnt with all the altered CSS attributes
[11:20:23] <Areckx> I am having a problem with the text in the caption here :: http://symmetrypilates.net/studio/studio1.html :: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5609430/ :: for some reason when I changed the size of the black box, the font changed position, and now it isn't centered, how can I fix that?
[11:21:04] <Areckx> also when the page loads, it shows all of the pictures in a super fast sequence before settling on the first, how can  I fix that?
[11:34:01] <Areckx> oh adding $(document).ready(function(){ fixed the last part
[11:36:47] <Areckx> for nivo slider, how can  I change the spacing of the numbers in .nivo-controlNav?
[11:40:35] <whatever_42> hey. i am trying to update a number in a certain intervall. and this process should not stop the browser from working.
[11:41:10] <whatever_42> or a div would be more accurate
[11:41:11] <Areckx> got all my problems squared away, thank you
[11:46:29] <Keavon> I want to call something to happen once when the page is loaded, AND when the window is being resized
[11:46:42] <Keavon> Current I can only do one or the other, unless I copy/paste the code to do it for both
[11:46:56] <Keavon> Here is my code:
[11:46:56] <Keavon> 		$(document).ready(function(){
[11:46:56] <Keavon> 			$(window).resize(function() {
[11:46:56] <Keavon> 				$("#page").height( $(document).height() - 100 );
[11:46:56] <Keavon> 			});
[11:46:58] <Keavon> 		});
[11:49:51] <tw2113> jsfiddleplz
[11:50:05] <Keavon> anyone know?
[11:50:21] <tw2113> no need to flood the channel via pasting right into it
[11:50:50] <Keavon> Sorry. But I thought it would be nicer to paste code here since it's only 5 lines.
[11:50:55] <Keavon> If it were longer, I'd use Pastebin
[11:51:36] <tw2113> common ediquette is anything longer than 2
[11:51:38] <rvsjoen> resize the page on domready, then bind to the resize event
[11:52:05] <rvsjoen> or, bind to the resize event, and then fire the resize event on domready
[11:52:08] <andkore> how can I troubleshoot why my selector works on a parent div ID, but not the child div ID that I actually want to target?
[11:52:28] <Keavon> rvsjoen: Could you show me what that code looks like? I literally started using jQuery an hour ago, so I'm not sure how that all works.
[11:59:31] <Khruu> Can jquery ajax handle 302 error?
[12:02:51] <Keavon> rvsjoen, how do you bind window.resize to my code?
[12:03:00] <Keavon> I've tried a bunch of things but it's not working
[12:03:38] <iliketurtles_> How do I get the $(this) context from a method nested within a function? https://gist.github.com/Lordnibbler/5474210
[12:04:38] <spobat> can I attach a clicked listener on all "<button>" s?
[12:05:00] <spobat> $('button').click(function() { }); should work, right?
[12:05:01] <iliketurtles_> spobat: $("button").on('click', function() { //stuff } )
[12:05:23] <spobat> iliketurtles_, is the "on" somehow better than ".click"?
[12:06:01] <iliketurtles_> click is a shortcut for on
[12:06:33] <spobat> well alright, i'll keep using .click then :D
[12:06:55] <iliketurtles_> the difference is .on works for dynamically added elements
[12:07:24] <spobat> oh
[12:07:47] <spobat> ty for that info
[12:07:57] <iliketurtles_> on is like bind/live, but those are now deprecated
[12:08:02] <iliketurtles_> or at least one of them is, can't remember which
[12:08:13] <spobat> ok
[12:09:20] <iliketurtles_> another thing to know
[12:09:38] <iliketurtles_> .click creates a separate handler for EVERY instance of the selector you are matching against
[12:09:56] <iliketurtles_> .on can be used to create only one handler is created for ALL elements matching
[12:10:04] <spobat> :o
[12:10:07] <spobat> I'll always use on
[12:10:10] <spobat> :p
[13:19:39] <iliketurtles_> Anyone have an idea why   $("li").resizable({ alsoResize: $("li#edit") }) works but  $("li").resizable({ alsoResize: $(this).next() }) doesn't?  The element passed to the alsoResize member is the same element if I console.log them :|
[14:08:02] <ezakimak> how much overhead does $(dom_node) have? is it worth it to compute $(dom_node) once and keep it if you need it multiple times?
[14:09:27] <tw2113> yes
[14:09:32] <tw2113> cache your selectors when you can
[14:09:40] <ezakimak> not a selector, a single dom node
[14:10:12] <tw2113> that you will refer to many times
[14:10:19] <tw2113> i stand by my statement
[14:10:22] <ezakimak> ok
[14:10:34] <Z3R0> quick stupid question, but if I load a main css file in the <head> section of a document, how can I "swap" that in jquery?
[14:10:37] <tw2113> $(dom_node) <---selects it
[14:10:44] <tw2113> var foobar = $(dom_node);
[14:10:58] <tw2113> foobar.addClass('doneit');
[14:11:14] <Z3R0> can I access the <head> section with $('head') ?
[14:11:40] <Z3R0> just trying to make a basic theme switcher atm
[14:11:51] <tw2113> ?tias
[14:11:52] <b-ot> tw2113: Try It And See
[14:12:19] <Z3R0> even if I could access $('head') I wouldn't know how to reference that file... unless I append it at the bottom ?
[14:12:31] <Z3R0> and call 2 style sheets...
[14:34:09] <djQuery> can anyone explain why puck speed doesn't work?  http://jsbin.com/efojod/1/edit
[14:34:25] <djQuery> it keeps using the same speed
[14:37:39] <djQuery> Z3R0, isn't the newest attached style sheet going to have precendence anyway?
[14:37:58] <djQuery> don't need to worry about removing one just add the new one?
[14:39:55] <djQuery> can anyone explain why puck speed doesn't work?  http://jsbin.com/efojod/1/edit
[14:46:21] <b_52globe> guys anybody using tinymce
[14:46:36] <b_52globe> i'm having trouble with 	tinyMCE.activeEditor.execCommand('mceInsertContent', false, {{tmp}});
[14:46:46] <b_52globe> {{tmp}} contain a full html template
[14:50:20] <sahbeewah> djQuery, the speed argument is required to be a number
[14:54:27] <sahbeewah> to clarify, jQuery has aliases for durations, namely ["slow", "fast", "_default"], and if you pass in a string like "500" it will type-check that argument, think it's a string and try to find it in its list of aliased durations. in this case it will fail and revert back to the default
[14:55:02] <sahbeewah> in other words, call parseInt() on the input value before you pass it into the animate function
[14:58:28] <cmaddalozzo> hey all, i'm stuck trying to remember the name of a library and was hoping maybe you guys could help. essentially helps with listeners like window.resize and allows you to only fire them every x amount of time regardless of how often the event is being fired.
[15:11:50] <nesoi> so which version of jquery is compatibile with jqm 1.3.1?
[15:12:01] <nesoi> for some reason they don't bother to say on the jqm site
[15:43:12] <andrewSC> hi all
[15:43:35] <andrewSC> i'm trying to do a transition effect using css3 and it only works if i set a break point after the addClass function in my js
[15:43:40] <andrewSC> any thoughts why that's the case?
[15:44:14] <andrewSC> and if i don't set the breakpoint then the display is instant
[15:46:22] * nettuts12345 may be in the wrong channel
[15:57:47] <stu7> I must be doing something stupid, but still unable to figure it out.  I'm doing a simple test by copying html, css & jquery lines to a brand new, local html file.  It simply does not run neither IE9 nor FF19.  I did insert the script commands to call jquery V1.9 and jquery.isotope, but still no luck.  Any pointers, please?
[15:58:00] <stu7> sorry, link: http://jsfiddle.net/DA3wF/55/
[15:59:04] <midnightcoffee> How would i got about having select all checkbox for a row (in a table) of checkboxes? I tried, http://briancray.com/posts/check-all-jquery-javascript but could only make it select the entire table. This is my first time working with jquery.
[16:40:23] <relipse> I have an application which has a people who can be in groups, we have groups and we have subgroups, but it only goes to one level a group can have a sub-group, but a sub group cannot have any more sub groups of its own...... Is there a jquery plugin where i can add groups and subgroups (similar to folder and files treeview, but only 1 level deep) ?
[16:43:13] <relipse> is this any good: http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-treetable/#examples
[16:43:37] <dblosevn> Hey Guys I got a weird problem, im storing 502014E8 as a data parameter, and when i try to display the value i get 50201400000000 its like javascript is thinking thats a hex string and converting it to decimal, any ideas?
[16:44:08] <relipse> e8 is your problem
[16:44:14] <relipse> seems like you'd need to store as a string
[16:44:36] <dblosevn> ya i see that but why on earth would it assume thats a number?
[16:44:36] <relipse> '' + val
[16:44:45] <relipse> because e8 multiplies by 10 8 times
[16:44:49] <dblosevn> i thought youd have to spciafy 0x before it
[16:44:50] <relipse> it is a number
[16:44:54] <relipse> it has nothing to do with hex
[16:45:06] <midnightcoffee> anyone have a recommendation for how to learn jquery? books, on-line tutorials, etc..?
[16:45:12] <relipse> trial and error
[16:45:31] <relipse> ever type a really big number and get 3333e11
[16:45:35] <relipse> in a calculator
[16:45:40] <dblosevn> oh so thats not hex its e^8
[16:45:50] <relipse> e means * 10^8
[16:45:58] <relipse> e8 means * 10^8
[16:45:59] <dblosevn> ya thats what i meant
[16:46:06] <relipse> yes you need to store as string
[16:46:07] <dblosevn> thats depressing then
[16:46:14] <relipse> no its not
[16:46:21] <dblosevn> as im populating it via an html attrib
[16:46:29] <relipse> oh
[16:46:36] <relipse> show more code
[16:46:39] <relipse> i dont know what you mean
[16:46:40] <dblosevn> and the js engine is interpreting it like that
[16:46:51] <dblosevn> data-item-number="{$item.sizes[size].id_number}"
[16:47:12] <dblosevn> http://hcbaskets2.isvn.net/mesh/laser/balck_orange_2laserstripe.html?dev
[16:47:31] <dblosevn> the drop down above add to cart
[16:48:27] <dblosevn> this product only has one option but if you click the option it will replicate the problem after the Item # label
[16:48:49] <relipse> oh neat
[16:48:54] <relipse> good looking website btw
[16:49:01] <dblosevn> thx :-)
[16:49:45] <dblosevn> i thoguht all data parmas were treated as strings
[16:49:47] <relipse> data-item-number="502014E8"
[16:50:00] <dblosevn> unless you populate them with js then they maintain there type
[16:50:00] <relipse> well it appears you have to force it to be a string
[16:50:11] <relipse> i dont know why it wouldn't think it was a string
[16:50:47] <dblosevn> im thinking the problem might be in dropkick
[16:51:07] <relipse> i don't know what dropkick is
[16:51:14] <dblosevn> i had to modify it a bit to copy the data from the orginal dropdown to the dropkick dropdown
[16:51:31] <relipse> kinda a cute error though
[16:51:36] <dblosevn> http://jamielottering.github.io/DropKick/
[16:51:53] <dblosevn> just pretty dropdowns
[16:52:13] <dblosevn> didnt support data on the options though so i had to hack that in
[16:53:26] <dblosevn> 			$tmp.data(key, '' + data[key] + ''));
[16:53:32] <dblosevn> maybe thatll fix it
[16:53:40] <relipse> I have an application which has a people who can be in groups, we have groups and we have subgroups, but it only goes to one level a group can have a sub-group, but a sub group cannot have any more sub groups of its own...... Is there a jquery plugin where i can add groups and subgroups (similar to folder and files treeview, but only 1 level deep) ?
[16:54:04] <relipse> isnt there a .toString() or no?
[16:54:18] <relipse> but that wouldn't work either
[16:54:18] <relipse> hmm
[16:54:22] <dblosevn> it worked
[16:54:31] <relipse> great
[16:55:26] <relipse> brb
[16:55:31] <dblosevn> The way my menu bar works that could be supported if i wanted it to be
[16:55:54] <dblosevn> eg main -> sub -> sub -> sub-> sub etc
[16:56:08] <dblosevn> its all in your db structure
[16:58:24] <dblosevn> not sure a jquery plugin is what your after alkthough there maybe a treeview plugin that will handle the frontend for it
[17:03:40] <dblosevn> ill bbl
[17:15:01] <relipse> I have an application which has a people who can be in groups, we have groups and we have subgroups, but it only goes to one level a group can have a sub-group, but a sub group cannot have any more sub groups of its own......
