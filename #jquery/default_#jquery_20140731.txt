[00:33:40] <TordRock> Hi. How do I remove a node from a variable with an xml string? I'm able to find the node in question using $(xml).find("MyNodeode")[0] but I have no idea how to delete it
[01:27:25] <mrbubbles> morning guys
[01:27:51] <EdwardIII> hey, how can i diagnose a $(window).load(callback) not getting called?
[01:28:11] <slax0r> typo?
[01:28:14] <mrbubbles> EdwardIII: As in it's not loading on page load?
[01:28:27] <mrbubbles> Stick a console.log(0) in the empty function first and see if it outputs
[01:28:54] <mrbubbles> also check chrome console to make sure no JS errors or missing files
[01:29:06] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: that's right. i can see the blue and red lines in the network timeline in chrome so i know the doc has actually loaded
[01:29:22] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: no errors in console, and the console.log isn't getting triggered (that's how i know it's definitely not getting fired)
[01:30:20] <mrbubbles> hmm. well jquery must be included or you'd be getting errors
[01:30:26] <mrbubbles> is the JS definitely being included in the file? :)
[01:30:41] <mrbubbles> if it's wordpress etc sometimes it's not enqueued properly
[01:30:56] <EdwardIII> i stuck a console.log on the preceeding line before the $(window).load() to check the JS file is definitely getting loaded (it is)
[01:31:06] <EdwardIII> it's not wordpress but there is a lot of JS in this project including knockout
[01:31:20] <EdwardIII> is there an easy way for me to see what's bound to window.onload already? i guess just console.log(window.onload)?
[01:31:29] <slax0r> it might be that all onload events are unbind, somewhere
[01:32:17] <mrbubbles> does $(document).ready() work okay?
[01:32:19] <slax0r> EdwardIII: tried to debug it?
[01:32:33] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: yup
[01:32:50] <EdwardIII> slax0r: well i'm not sure what i'd be able to see with the debugger that console.log isn't already showing me?
[01:33:08] <slax0r> EdwardIII: you could go through the scripts step by step for one
[01:33:14] <slax0r> console.log is not a debugger
[01:33:47] <systemfault> Try $(document).on('load', ?
[01:33:50] <EdwardIII> slax0r: i'm looking to improve my skills with the chrome debugger, unrelated but one problem i always have with it is that because i'm using jquery every single step is locked up in jquery.js
[01:34:03] <EdwardIII> systemfault: document or window?
[01:34:07] <systemfault> document
[01:34:50] * EdwardIII tries
[01:35:41] <systemfault> Hmm, nevermind .. seems that document.onload is a mozilla thing.
[01:35:47] <EdwardIII> systemfault: $(document).on('load'... doesn't seem to work either
[01:36:00] <systemfault> (Sorry, can't remember the last time I used the load event except on images)
[01:38:56] <EdwardIII> systemfault: heh no worries, appreciate the input
[01:43:36] <mrbubbles> Guys, I have a link which calls an anonymous function when clicked. The first thing it does is remove the link that was clicked, but then $(this) is unavailable (even, it seems, if I set _this = $(this) first). Can anyone advise
[01:43:39] <EdwardIII> slax0r: is there an article i can use to get a better idea of how i can navigate around this "stuck in jquery core" issue when trying to debug stuff?
[01:43:43] <mrbubbles> Much easier to see from a fiddle :) http://jsfiddle.net/LcjT8/
[01:44:11] <mrbubbles> Basically if the .remove() line isn't there then it changes the background, but if it is then it doesn't. I want it to do it regardless
[01:44:13] <slax0r> EdwardIII: normally you'd jump over calls to jquery
[01:44:22] <slax0r> all you need to find when and if the onload events get binned
[01:45:24] <EdwardIII> hrm actually i'm running into another issue with the debugger
[01:45:46] <EdwardIII> i'm on a parent page that includes an iframe (i'm working on some cross-domain parent-iframe resizing)
[01:46:43] <jamesbrown> hi i am trying to do an if statement like this http://pastebin.com/RHYKZMHT which says if the name="your_city" do this else do that but jquery disagree with the sytnax what have i do wrong?
[01:47:23] <EdwardIII> and the debugger doesn't seem to be catching stuff happening inside the iframe which makes sense
[01:48:15] <slax0r> not the easiest thing to debug js :)
[01:48:16] <EdwardIII> ah, it's very easy to get it to work on the iframe instead
[01:48:38] <slax0r> but do you absolutely need the onload?
[01:49:07] <EdwardIII> slax0r: i do
[01:50:23] <EdwardIII> oh hrm i'm changing the context for console which doesn't change the context of the debugger, damn
[01:55:26] <EdwardIII> wait... does onload have to be wrapped inside docready?
[01:59:41] <EdwardIII> hmm no seems to make no difference
[02:00:21] <mrbubbles> Can anyone advise please :)
[02:00:58] <jamesbrown> i have look at the examples on google and try it like var cities = $('input[name="your_city"]').val(); but i am getting an error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[02:01:26] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: i'm a little confused from this fiddle, what are you trying to do again? just make the link disappear when it's clicked?
[02:02:33] <mrbubbles> Hi EdwardIII  - no - you see how it makes the background of the parent div green? It works if the link is there, but if I remove the link first it doesn't work
[02:02:59] <mrbubbles> I want to remove the link, then make the parent div green. But I can't figure out how to store a reference to the parent object
[02:03:28] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: are there loads of these links on the page, or just one?
[02:04:00] <mrbubbles> loads
[02:04:06] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: could you paste your broken example?
[02:04:12] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: paste/fiddle
[02:04:25] <mrbubbles> http://jsfiddle.net/LcjT8/1/
[02:04:44] <mrbubbles> that one is broken and this one: http://jsfiddle.net/LcjT8/2/ works
[02:04:46] <mrbubbles> but doesn't remove the link
[02:04:52] <mrbubbles> so $(this) still valid
[02:05:56] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: 'owzat? http://jsfiddle.net/LcjT8/3/
[02:05:59] <EdwardIII> is that what you meant?
[02:06:48] <mrbubbles> Not quite :) I need to remove the link first as it's an html newsletter that is being built
[02:08:21] <mrbubbles> Hmm maybe I need to rethink my app logic...
[02:08:57] <EdwardIII> mrbubbles: any reason not to hide instead of remove? http://jsfiddle.net/LcjT8/4/
[02:12:04] <jQueryNewbie> Hi!
[02:12:54] <mrbubbles> hi jQueryNewbie
[02:16:40] <jQueryNewbie> I was going to ask a question but I realize its almost lunch time so I better withhold it until I'm back. :)
[02:18:47] <EdwardIII> jQueryNewbie: it's far from lunchtime in the UK
[02:19:46] <Uhkis> i'm pretty sure he meant his own lunch break
[02:30:46] <suy> If I do a bunch of AJAX requests in parallel, how to know from the response handler which one comes from which requests? I expected to get the request parameters in the jqXHR, but I can't find it. Should I just add such data to it myself?
[02:41:27] <EdwardIII> Uhkis: today, everybody eats UK time!
[02:41:52] <Uhkis> EdwardIII: what's the nutrition value of this uk time?
[02:42:10] * Woet squints at Uhkis 
[02:42:22] <qxxx> fish+chips = ~ 500kcal
[02:42:27] <EdwardIII> Uhkis: well it's deep fried so it's about 4k caleries with no minerals or vitamains
[02:42:32] <Uhkis> oh noes, not Woet
[02:42:50] <Uhkis> EdwardIII: sounds great, ill have 2 servings
[02:46:22] <EdwardIII> so, are there any pointers on how i can diagnose why my $(window).on('load... isn't triggering? it's inside an iframe and there's a bunch of stuff going on (requirejs, knockout, some jquery libs). i wouldn't mind setting a breakpoint on the 'load' event in chrome but i can't make the debugger look to the child iframe's contents for this feature?
[03:05:34] <droid909> why -1 is  true?
[03:11:12] <t432> can you submit a form without appending it to document? e.g. $('<form>..</form>').submit();
[03:13:44] <t432> nvm
[03:14:17] <EdwardIII> could it be because i'm calling $(window).on('load'... after <body> is already in the DOM? would that break it?
[03:18:20] <EdwardIII> hrm what the heck, i put together an incredibly simple contrived example here and it also doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/f9mAA/
[03:18:48] <systemfault> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/f9mAA/1/
[03:19:03] <systemfault> Don't expect a .load to work inside another .load
[03:19:45] <EdwardIII> systemfault: also works at the bottom of the body which is closer to my config: http://jsfiddle.net/f9mAA/2/
[03:20:32] * EdwardIII scratches his head
[03:23:36] <EdwardIII> i'm going ot try and make a less contrived example
[03:30:04] <EdwardIII> systemfault: ok here's a more realistic example: http://jsfiddle.net/f9mAA/3/
[03:32:05] <systemfault> Well.. looks obvious to me.
[03:32:19] <systemfault> The load event just happens before require.js is initialized..
[03:33:12] <K4T> $deleteBtn
[03:33:13] <K4T> .closest('li')
[03:33:13] <K4T> .clone()
[03:33:13] <K4T> .addClass('center-block')
[03:33:13] <K4T> .html(); any ideas why addClass not add class to cloned element?
[03:35:03] <madalin> K4T: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8720432/jquery-adding-class-to-cloned-element
[03:36:36] <madalin> K4T: basically it tells you that the cloned element shares the same id, and that that should be incremented so that the .addclass works..
[03:37:35] <EdwardIII> systemfault: hrm, is the only solution to take this out of requirejs then i guess?
[03:38:08] <EdwardIII> systemfault: the thing is, docready works ok even if you put something into it after the doc is ready (i think it uses promises internally right?)
[03:38:38] <systemfault> EdwardIII: I don't know. I'm not doing weird things like that :P
[03:38:59] <systemfault> THere's no reason to use the window.onload event in 2014.
[03:39:12] <K4T> madalin: im not clonning object by id
[03:39:17] <EdwardIII> systemfault: what if i want to wait until all content on the page is loaded including images so i can calculate the height?
[03:39:48] <madalin> K4T: exactly. So the cloned element has the same ID as the cloned one. Please have a read on that link
[03:40:23] <systemfault> EdwardIII: Your images don't have a width/height?
[03:40:58] <K4T> madalin, $deleteBtn.closest('li').clone().attr('id', 'newid').addClass('center-block').html(), same result
[03:41:25] <EdwardIII> systemfault: it's possible that some of them might not, plus the height of the page will be different depending on the amount of content loaded, right?
[03:41:30] <EdwardIII> i.e. text?
[03:41:50] <EdwardIII> actually maybe a better approach is to listen on resize?
[03:42:04] <madalin> K4T: what is newid defined as ?
[03:42:15] <systemfault> EdwardIII: I have no idea what you're trying to do.
[03:42:54] <EdwardIII> systemfault: resize a parent iframe size from a child iframe
[03:43:09] <madalin> K4T: try $deleteBtn.closest('li').clone().attr('id',id += 1).addClass('center-block').html()
[03:43:25] <K4T> madalin, .attr('id', 'newid') this should add id attrib with 'newid' to new (cloned one) element, yes?
[03:43:38] <madalin> K4T: ^^
[03:44:40] <Uhkis> does clone() return the cloned object or the original one?
[03:46:43] <K4T> cloned
[03:51:33] <EdwardIII> hrm ok so resize isn't what i want
[03:51:50] <EdwardIII> is there an event i can listen for to find out when an event's actual, real height changes? i.e. not a css attribute change, not dom mutation? http://jsfiddle.net/gkC7R/
[03:52:21] <EdwardIII> obviously resize isn't the right thing here (i think it's basically just for when the window is resized by the user, right?)
[03:52:33] <djam90> Guys, I am having an issue with animating scrolling. It is jQuery code but still I feel it is more a JS question. If you go on http://goo.gl/Y7y5m4 and click on some of the cars... Once you click the car once it creates the element that you see below. Then if you click another car it creates the element for that car and hides the first one.
[03:52:45] <djam90> I am trying to get it so that when you click on another car then the element below centers in the viewport
[03:52:51] <djam90> I have tried numerous pieces of code including https://www.perturb.org/display/1059_jQuery__center_the_viewport_on_an_element.html  and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11529070/scroll-to-the-center-of-viewport
[03:53:18] <Uhkis> K4T: hmm, what's the point of that .html() ?
[04:01:28] <Vivekananda_y510> anyone around . I have run into some jquery that is part of someones project and am trying to figure out the meaning of some constructs. Can someone help me a bit . Here is the code of hte function : https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/baa475211fb2cda3dad3
[04:24:00] <K4T> how to convert ENTIRE jQuery element to html string?
[04:30:25] <Uhkis> why would you want to do that?
[04:35:42] <K4T> unkis: to add this to my html string
[04:36:40] <morfin> hello
[04:36:50] <morfin> how do i properly handle an error with .get?
[04:37:26] <morfin> i tried that:$.get(url,{},dataType).fail(error){...} but it handles even 200(hm)
[04:37:57] <doberman> morfin, maybe put some .done() before that .fail() ?
[04:38:23] <morfin> ow i forgot
[04:38:29] <morfin> i used callback
[04:38:48] <Uhkis> K4T: appendto?
[04:39:08] <morfin> $.get(url,{},function(data){//success},dataType).fail(error){...}
[04:40:46] <doberman> fail() accepts a function
[04:44:52] <emx> what does .val() return when the element is hidden?
[04:46:11] <doberman> What do you mean by hidden?
[04:46:39] <guest______> Hello. I've read the book jQuery in Action, second edition and in there I often see the use of the term "wrapped set". However, in the documentation I can't find any reference to this tem. Is this term still used? Should I used jQuery collection? Any other name?
[04:49:58] <doberman> It's just a collection
[04:50:28] <doberman> How old is that book? :)
[04:52:07] <guest______> I bought it a couple of years ago.
[04:52:19] <guest______> Any reference for the correct term to use?
[04:52:24] <doberman> collection
[04:53:11] <miCSu_> guest______: for example $("p") is a wrapped set of all the paragraphs
[04:54:08] <Uhkis> yeah, that's the problem with books
[04:54:32] <guest______> I know what the authors meant with "wrapped set", I was just wondering if it's still correct
[04:55:02] <guest______> and where I can find somwhere "official" that refers to the term "collection" as suggested by doberman
[04:55:26] <doberman> guest______, http://api.jquery.com/category/miscellaneous/collection-manipulation/
[04:55:41] <guest______> Thank you so much doberman!
[04:56:22] <guest______> Just the last question: in the book the authors use "utility functions" but I've also found on the web the term "utility methods". What is correct?
[04:56:45] <miCSu> I'd say method = member function
[04:58:13] <guest______> Just to be clear, the book refers to "utility function" to things like jQuery.trim() or jQuery.type()
[05:00:25] <miCSu> guest______: see the differences between http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/ and http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:02:22] <guest______> Thank you for the reference. My understanding is that each() is a wrapped method (is this the correct term?) and is a jQuery.each() is a utility function/method. Am I right? Sorry but at this point I'm a bit confused about the terminology to use.
[05:03:03] <miCSu> guest______: I'd say that the first link refers to utility function while the latter to utility method
[05:05:19] <guest______> Thank you. Do you have any reference I can check to find the right terminology?
[05:05:42] <miCSu> but that's just my understanding, never been much of a terminology guy
[05:06:27] <guest______> I see, thank you anyway. I'll see if anyone want to answer my question
[05:08:25] <Vivekananda_y510> lainot a completely jquery question but wonder if someone can help a bit
[05:08:34] <Vivekananda_y510> not*
[05:09:04] <Uhkis> guest______: if terminology is your biggest problem, you're lucky ;)
[05:10:01] <guest______> Well, I'm not an expert but I want to learn in the right way.
[05:10:54] <doberman> When you write code you don't give a F about terminology. :)
[05:12:24] <guest______> If a developer is just a machine to write code, then probably I chose the wrong career.
[05:12:46] <guest______> I want also be able to describe my code in a proper way.
[05:13:27] <systemfault> guest______: You deserve a medal for not choosing the path of the mediocrity, sir.
[05:23:51] <EdwardIII> heh debounce, one of those things you think would require a couple of lines of code, just to check you see how underscore do it, and it's always more complex than you think
[05:27:27] * EdwardIII borrows underscore's debounce
[05:29:50] <doberman> guest______, describe - as in comments of the code or? Sorry but I really don't get it :)
[05:36:42] <guest______> There's this kind of thing in the world, If I recall, which is called mouth. Surprisingly enough it can emit sounds, and sometimes it's even used to talk with other people about what you're doing.
[05:46:34] <t432> can you trigger an event inside the window.open() (e.g. window.open('some_trigger')?
[05:48:32] <lolipop> any one can speak chinese?
[06:15:51] <Benedict> this is passed with PHP to my ajax function: http://pastebin.com/L37L0EyM
[06:15:57] <Benedict> I need to parse the jquery but it is resulting in an error
[06:16:07] <Benedict> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[06:16:20] <Benedict> yes, that is jquery inside the jquery.
[06:16:53] <MacroMan> I'm trying to call find('a') on a jQuery object that I produced using parseHTML, but I'm getting an error: http://jsfiddle.net/86CGY/
[06:17:10] <MacroMan> I get "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" on line 5
[06:18:16] <MacroMan> Can I not use find() on an object created this way?
[06:18:55] <systemfault> MacroMan: parseHTML returns pure DOM nodes, you need to jQuerify them
[06:19:19] <systemfault> var result = $($.parseHTML(theHtml));
[06:19:36] <Vivekananda_y510> everyone left #web ?
[06:19:45] <Vivekananda_y510> is mooncup around ?
[06:19:46] <systemfault> Then you'll be able to use .find on result
[06:19:47] <MacroMan> systemfault, Ah, thanks. I'll give it a try
[06:19:53] <systemfault> Vivekananda_y510: Net split.
[06:20:38] <Vivekananda_y510> hmmm.   I am trying to look at the lines in the dev tools and a funny thing happens. I see that the run enters the if block but also the line 14 in the else block . Is this to be expected ? https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/baa475211fb2cda3dad3
[06:21:13] <morfin> guys
[06:21:54] <morfin> async jQuery methods like .get,.post,.load,.getScript can be properly promisified by bluebird?
[06:22:11] <morfin> using Promise.promisify($.get); as instance
[06:22:13] <mooncup> Vivekananda_y510: yes but sorta busy
[06:22:18] <mooncup> you sitll playing with smartadmin?
[06:23:07] <systemfault> morfin: Promise.resolve($.get(….)) IIRC
[06:23:11] <Vivekananda_y510> yeah and would be really selfish but grateful if you had a couple of mins here and there :)
[06:23:16] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, ^
[06:24:18] <morfin> hmmm
[06:24:44] <morfin> but what about args?
[06:26:59] <morfin> i am using promisified version which in success handler resolve promise and in .fail just rejects it
[06:27:47] <systemfault> morfin: What?
[06:27:50] <systemfault> What args?
[06:28:05] <Vivekananda_y510> anyone care to comment on my question above ?
[06:29:05] <mooncup> sure
[06:29:09] <mooncup> what's the question?
[06:29:24] <Vivekananda_y510> ooo I asked you something specific too
[06:29:27] <Vivekananda_y510> :)
[06:29:36] <Vivekananda_y510> <Vivekananda_y510> yeah and would be really selfish but grateful if you had a couple of mins here and there :)
[06:29:57] <mooncup> that's no problem
[06:31:17] <ahandy> hi, what’s the best secure way to have a $.post request with a user ID that I can get from PHP?
[06:31:30] <Benedict> how can I do something like var marker[name] = new google.maps.Marker({
[06:31:32] <ahandy> i dont want to have it as a data-attr or variable or whatnot because it can be easily edited
[06:31:34] <Benedict> marker[name] isn't valid
[06:33:11] <mooncup> ahandy: don't try to make your javascript secure
[06:33:29] <mooncup> people can make it do whatever the hell they want
[06:33:34] <mooncup> secure everything at the php side
[06:35:32] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, but I am seeing you today after like 2 weeks !! I tried pinging you a lot of times and also did not wish to ping you directly coz I hadnt asked you before
[06:35:43] <mooncup> yeah sorry I've been on holiday for a week
[06:36:03] <Vivekananda_y510> oo okay so is it okay if I pined you with your handle like once or twice sometime ?
[06:36:44] <Vivekananda_y510> or if there is a time that you are relatively free I can use that to my advantage as well
[06:38:05] <jop008> Anyone interested on this http://ezbuild.sourceforge.net This is the start for editing metameta http://ezbuild.touchingservices.nl/metameta. Help for the GUI would be great. For instance two different themes. Create with jquery/jquery mobile 1.4.3 and PHP MySQL
[06:39:38] <airdem> how can i set a custom format for jquery spinner to display "xh" where x is the number. (want to use it as duration input in hours)
[06:39:52] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, ^^
[06:44:15] <Vivekananda_y510> if you are theere and saw my question above please respond. The question was : oo okay so is it okay if I pined you with your handle like once or twice sometime ?  or if there is a time that you are relatively free I can use that to my advantage as well
[06:45:52] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, if you are theere and saw my question above please respond. The question was : oo okay so is it okay if I pined you with your handle like once or twice sometime ?  or if there is a time that you are relatively free I can use that to my advantage as well
[06:47:37] <mooncup> sure
[06:47:39] <mooncup> send me a pm
[06:47:42] <mooncup> I'll be more likely to get it
[06:48:00] <mooncup> I might be slow answering
[06:48:03] <mooncup> but I should see it eventually
[06:50:30] <Vivekananda_y510> great thanks
[06:50:40] <Vivekananda_y510> as to the current question if you have a min I will go into it
[06:52:22] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, as to the current question if you have a min I will go into it
[06:52:29] <mooncup> sure
[06:58:52] <PrasanthG> Here is the issue http://202.53.73.31:89/index.html
[06:59:26] <ahandy> mooncup: so suppose i ignore security and i send the user id via js to php, how can i make sure that the user id sent belongs to the user himself
[06:59:32] <PrasanthG> Asking for stop script
[07:01:04] <dmsuperman> ahandy: you want to verify that a user ID belongs to the person sending the request?
[07:01:05] <mdev> so i'm using a $.post
[07:01:17] <mdev> and on .done I have json array content sent by my server side script
[07:01:20] <ahandy> dmsuperman: yess
[07:01:21] <dmsuperman> ahandy: The way to do that is that you don't let the client specify the user ID :P
[07:01:24] <mdev> that contains html...it gives me parse error
[07:01:24] <mooncup> ahandy: are you using sessions in php?
[07:01:39] <ahandy> mooncup: yes, but im sending the request via jquery, will the session be maintained?
[07:01:42] <dmsuperman> ahandy: the client sends the user/password, the server looks up the user ID based on that, then the server stores the user ID in a session
[07:01:42] <ahandy> dmsuperman:  i know
[07:01:43] <mdev> but alert shows the html escaped fine, so I don't get it
[07:01:49] <mooncup> ahandy: yes
[07:01:49] <mdev> without the html works nicely
[07:01:54] <ahandy> mooncup: oh, okay
[07:01:57] <dmsuperman> ahandy: yes sessions are maintained, cookies are sent with ajax requests
[07:01:59] <mooncup> as long as you call session_start etc
[07:02:05] <ahandy> okay thank you
[07:02:09] <BillCriswell> ahandy: The server knows who's logged in. You always check every request coming in to make sure it's right.
[07:02:16] <mooncup> as far as the server is concerned there is no difference
[07:02:16] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I have two major issues and each has its own minor ones. I will go ahead with the current one that I am working on .  so currently I stripped the main site down to this : http://6526ec6c.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/index3.html .  Now I am trying to understand the code  so I can completely remove the left nav bar and have just the area chart box but the code is convoluted.  I found that the code line
[07:02:16] <Vivekananda_y510> in app.min.js ( can see in dev tools)  has the function checkUrl which if changed can help me acheive this . Gimme some pointers on how to do that please
[07:02:17] <ahandy> cool cool, didnt know its maintained
[07:02:31] <BillCriswell> Ideally the user id would be handled on the server side
[07:03:01] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, if I remove the left nav bar <nav></nav> block then the area chart disappears too !
[07:03:04] <andrew9183> is there a way to get a selector of the jquery element
[07:03:52] <mooncup> <nav style ="display:none">
[07:03:53] <mooncup> tis a hack
[07:03:59] <mooncup> but it could work
[07:04:22] <mdev> guess that clever guy not on
[07:04:25] <mdev> he always has the answers
[07:04:55] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: Can you ask that differently? Not sure I am following.
[07:05:58] <PrasanthG> Any help to fix this unresponsive script error http://202.53.73.31:89/index.html
[07:06:01] <andrew9183> sure, for example if I had var foo = $(".foo .bar");
[07:06:09] <andrew9183> i would want to get ".foo .bar"
[07:06:49] <andrew9183> i have a jacky parse-y solution with attr.class
[07:07:55] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: You can use foo.selector to get it, but mind if I ask why you need it?
[07:08:49] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, isnt there a way to delete the code for the nav itself and then change the backend js so that it is not bothered. I figured out that the checkurl code is the culprit .
[07:09:05] <Vivekananda_y510> hello Velveeta remember talking to you but dont see you around
[07:09:12] <Vivekananda_y510> and of course hello BillCriswell :)
[07:09:24] <mrbubbles> hmmm... if I have a function which is being dynamically assigned to a click event, I can't use $(this) in the function?
[07:09:40] <Velveeta> yeah, i keep pretty busy at work these days, bouncing around between multiple product teams, but i'm typically here if you ping me by name like you just did :)
[07:10:12] <mooncup> Vivekananda_y510: pastebin the checkurl code
[07:10:19] <mooncup> I don't have time to look through everything for it
[07:10:25] <mooncup> but I can have a quick look if you show me where to look
[07:10:30] <Vivekananda_y510> sure one sec
[07:10:37] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda_y510: Ay.
[07:10:44] <Vivekananda_y510> https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/baa475211fb2cda3dad3
[07:10:56] <andrew9183> BillCriswell: i thought that was deprecated and removed in 1.9
[07:11:26] <mooncup> ok so it looks in the nav for what page to load
[07:11:36] <andrew9183> i suppose its a structure problem that i don't want to fix
[07:11:39] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: I just tried it with 2.1.0 and it worked. They might plan on removing it, though. What do you need it for?
[07:11:43] <andrew9183> ah
[07:11:45] <mooncup> so if you take out the nav it has nowhere to look
[07:11:45] <BillCriswell> Ah, got it.
[07:11:50] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: http://jsbin.com/kokakuza/1/edit
[07:12:00] <mooncup> Vivekananda_y510 ^
[07:12:24] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, the index3.html in the link I posted calls the dashboard.html and these are the only two pages. the dashboard.html loads and has the <nav> elements
[07:12:58] <decx> is the internet dying or is that just my isp
[07:13:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Figuratively or actually?
[07:13:32] <andrew9183> so basically i have a list of 5 icons and whenever i drag one of them, i want to create a ghost of that image.  i've written all the drag and drop manually without jquery ui, and so when i create the ghost, i clone the element, and append it as a sibling with a class of ghost and need to check if it exists
[07:13:34] <decx> yes
[07:13:37] <andrew9183> so convoluted
[07:13:41] <mooncup> try commenting out lines 9 and 10 and see what happens Vivekananda_y510
[07:14:00] <mooncup> also create a variable called d with a dummy title in
[07:14:04] <mooncup> or the other bit will break
[07:14:09] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I was not able to understtand what the lines 11 and 14 are doing  and why there is a comma (, ) in between. Also another issue is if I look in dev tools while running the page the code enters BOTH the if and the else blocks ( for else it goes to line 14 only ) I wonder why
[07:14:11] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: jQuery UI has a ghost helper that might interest you?
[07:14:33] <mooncup> document.title = d || document.title, loadURL(a + location.search, container)
[07:14:34] <andrew9183> yeah, i don't know why we avoided jquery ui, but its written without it
[07:14:48] <Vivekananda_y510> I will try commenting out line 9 and 10
[07:14:50] <mooncup> if d is not false then it will run the function
[07:14:50] <dmsuperman> Vivekananda_y510: are you sure the dev tools aren't just showing you that it's processing the if condition, the if condition is false, and so it moves onto the else condition?
[07:15:06] <Vivekananda_y510> and then remove
[07:15:06] <mooncup> brb
[07:15:07] <BillCriswell> I totally read "without" as "with". I'm an idiot.
[07:15:21] <BillCriswell> decx: Absolutely.
[07:15:22] <mrbubbles> I have a page of links which are being dynamically generated. I want to assign click actions to these links when they are generated, so I have a function called clickAction() and then when a link is generated I’m doing .on('click', clickAction); The problem is that in this clickAction function $(this) doesn't seem to work (I thought it would take the value of whichever link sent it). Is it possible to pass the sender over somehow? Thanks :)
[07:15:59] <Vivekananda_y510> dmsuperman, I might be mistaken but if you run the page yourself and use devtools then you see that it goes to ALL lines inside the if and then goes to line 14 for some reason . I don t understand how both can happen
[07:16:02] <Vivekananda_y510> lemme try again
[07:16:17] <ChoboBill> keep getting unexpected token else - http://jsfiddle.net/a6qQ5/
[07:18:09] <Vivekananda_y510> dmsuperman, I am sorry  but it is working fine in chrome
[07:18:17] <Vivekananda_y510> it was showing that in firefox for some reason
[07:20:06] <d3m0n> Hey, can someone help me on why the number doesn't increase http://jsfiddle.net/7EJbV/ ?
[07:20:11] <dmsuperman> ChoboBill: how can you have an else followed by an elseif follow by another else?
[07:20:43] <dmsuperman> d3m0n: it does. you set y to 0, then it increases by 1 to 1, then it prints
[07:20:49] <ChoboBill> dmsuperman: i'm working through an exercise on codeacademy
[07:21:24] <ChoboBill> dmsuperman: it says to create "else if" and then "else"
[07:21:48] <phoenixsun> is there are good channel to go to get Youtube API support?
[07:22:12] <d3m0n> dmsuperman: lol.. doh..
[07:22:29] <d3m0n> ty
[07:22:47] <dmsuperman> ChoboBill: else if and then else is correct
[07:23:14] <dmsuperman> ChoboBill: but look below that... you have if, elseif, else, elseif, else
[07:23:25] <dmsuperman> else is the last statement and there can only be one else
[07:24:06] <dmsuperman> ChoboBill: I suspect you meant the first else to be a part of the nested if-within-elseif
[07:24:27] <ChoboBill> dmsuperman: ah, so i removed the first else
[07:24:57] <decx> i cant access any page or write emails but irc works fine, irc as best protocol confirmed
[07:25:02] <ChoboBill> dmsuperman: working now, made the return "paper wins" part of the first elseif statement
[07:26:28] <mdev> why would parsejson fail on this http://pastebin.com/Z0S9i9si
[07:26:31] <mdev> it's valid json
[07:27:22] <systemfault> mdev: It's valid.
[07:27:34] <systemfault> >> JSON.parse('[{"What":"test_div","html":"<div class='success'><div class='title'><i class='image-box'><\/i> Title:<\/div>content message<\/div>"}]');
[07:27:50] <systemfault> Ah, thought I was on another channel...
[07:28:35] <mdev> systemfault so any reason parsejson should fail on that?
[07:28:39] <mdev> am recieving via .post
[07:28:44] <mdev> which works fine for everything else
[07:28:58] <mdev> error is Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token
[07:29:16] <dmsuperman> mdev: likely a quotes issue
[07:29:21] <dmsuperman> is my first thought
[07:29:35] <BillCriswell> mdev: That works fine for me.
[07:29:35] <mdev> well they all seem escapped with \
[07:29:45] <mdev> herm ok i'll test more thanks
[07:30:09] <BillCriswell> var string = "[{\"What\":\"test_div\",\"html\":\"<div class='success'><div class='title'><i class='image-box'><\/i> Title:<\/div>content message<\/div>\"}]";
[07:30:15] <BillCriswell> then JSON.parse(string);
[07:30:44] <BillCriswell> Are you manually building a JSON strong or something weird like that?
[07:31:27] <decx> i cant access the service portal page of my isp or any google domain but reddit works fine. what
[07:31:29] <mdev> I manually put together the html but I encode the array via json_encode in php
[07:31:44] <mdev> and output is what I pasted above
[07:31:51] <BillCriswell> decx: That doesn't sound good.
[07:32:17] <BillCriswell> mdev: so you're doing echo json_encode($phpArray);?
[07:33:02] <BillCriswell> If you're doing that just doing $.get('file.php').done(function(response){ // response would be the php array in Javascript });
[07:33:13] <BillCriswell> Blah, -just
[07:33:17] <BillCriswell> Need to stop using that word.
[07:34:56] <mdev> Bill i'm using post for a reason
[07:35:11] <mdev> also there's more to my array that works fine I loop through it to determine what to do
[07:35:23] <mdev> it's just adding html vs p;lain text causing parsejson to whine and fail
[07:36:06] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Remember that issue was trying to explain? I rewrote my small script into a plugin xP I have some examples of the script in the repo - https://github.com/jwmann/splash.js
[07:36:33] <BillCriswell> Well with post it wouldn't change things. If it's going through json_encode() the result in javascript should have no issues unless something weird is happening  on the server side.
[07:37:42] <BillCriswell> jwmann: Nice. I need to get more serious about github and helping out with open source
[07:37:55] <computer2000> anyone has an idea why ipad returns window.width and window.height = 1024px both the same???
[07:37:56] <BillCriswell> I mean.. besides helping in here 8 hours a day almost haha.
[07:39:17] <jwmann> Hahaha
[07:39:51] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Don't worry, regardless of what you do, you're a hero in my books. ;)
[07:40:02] <BillCriswell> Haha thanks.
[07:41:00] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/crswll/gulp-notes this is like.. the only thing that might actually be useful that I've put on github.
[07:42:11] <Jattenalle> haha BillCriswell, i like the example
[07:42:17] <Jattenalle> that damned Bill, with his regex!
[07:42:44] <BillCriswell> He's a true jerk.
[07:42:55] <d3m0n> How could I go about setting display block to the first X amount of elements matched?
[07:43:22] <BillCriswell> d3m0n: slice can work.
[07:43:25] <d3m0n> Would a loop be too much?
[07:43:39] <BillCriswell> $('li').slice(0, 5).css('display', 'block')
[07:43:54] <d3m0n> Ahh perfect! Ty BillCriswell
[07:43:54] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[07:43:58] <BillCriswell> NO o problem!
[07:45:33] <BillCriswell> d3m0n: There's also http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[07:45:50] <BillCriswell> d3m0n: I just prefer slice so I don't have to concat.
[07:46:44] <d3m0n> BillCriswell is there one that processes faster?
[07:47:14] <BillCriswell> No idea.
[07:47:45] <BillCriswell> I'd have to look to see how :lt works. I can't imagine it doing things much different than slicing it anyway.
[07:48:06] <d3m0n> Ok no problem, thanks again.
[07:48:24] <Jattenalle> d3m0n, this might be faster: [typign it up, give me a sec]
[07:49:07] <Jattenalle> actually, too hot for code.. but basically: you .each() it, and increase a global var by 1, return false (stop the each) once you hit the number you want
[07:49:10] <Jattenalle> it's MUCH uglier
[07:49:16] <Jattenalle> and i doubt it'll be much faster, if at all
[07:49:40] <Jattenalle> a for() loop if you will
[07:50:03] <Jattenalle> go with slice though, it's cleaner
[07:50:09] <d3m0n> yeah thats exactly what I was thinking at first but thought there had to be a better (cleaner?) way
[07:50:15] <Jattenalle> ^^
[08:02:40] <mdev> got to work thankfully googling, man that was stressful
[08:03:01] <mdev> used rawurlencode php side before json_encode
[08:03:08] <mdev> then decodeURIComponent on the html part of the array
[08:14:46] <palzie_> hey, is there a function that returns the whole html tag + classes + other stuff (soz for the description, better one there : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oinms)
[08:15:30] <duch_kazatel> palzie_ you want the markup for the current element?
[08:16:14] <palzie_> duch_kazatel: is markup the tag ? well i want the exact thing i wrote on codepen, which means the whole <tag class="....>i_want_this_too</tag>
[08:17:42] <duch_kazatel> there's no built-in function to do that, but there are ways to do it.
[08:17:48] <duch_kazatel> why do you need it, if you don't mind my asking?
[08:21:00] <palzie_> duch_kazatel: well, it's somehow long to explain but i'll do short
[08:22:01] <palzie_> duch_kazatel: i have an accordion menu that works like this : if the element has no children the html goes : <h3><a>link</a></h3>
[08:23:12] <palzie_> duch_kazatel: a style is applied to the h3 tag, but the a link works only if i click on the tex
[08:23:12] <palzie_> t
[08:23:39] <palzie_> duch_kazatel: and i just want the html to go : <a><h3>title</h3></a<
[08:24:00] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't require getting the html the way you want to.
[08:24:03] <palzie_> so that when one clicks on the "background", the redirection works
[08:24:27] <palzie_> well i was going "ye just have to replace <h3> with <a> and <a> with <h3> with specific conditions
[08:24:38] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[08:24:41] <palzie_> (which works in the dev console)
[08:24:43] <duch_kazatel> there's a much easier way.
[08:25:01] <palzie_> i'm listening to you :>
[08:25:04] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[08:25:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/NTq5h/
[08:26:01] <duch_kazatel> no javascript needed.
[08:26:48] <palzie_> duch_kazatel: well that's not that easy, i could have figured out myself otherwise ^^' but ye i accord u the fact that I didn't explain well
[08:28:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[08:28:18] <palzie_> duch_kazatel: it actually is that easy rofl. thanks mate
[08:28:24] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[08:29:00] <BillCriswell> I took the night off from the gym and went and had some beers at a meet up. I feel like a blimp.
[08:32:08] <MikeD_> did you move real slow?  please tell me you are wearing a T-shirt with advertising on it... that'd be funny.
[08:32:39] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Not sure I'm following haha
[08:32:48] <duch_kazatel> you feel like a blimp.
[08:32:54] <BillCriswell> duh.
[08:33:19] <BillCriswell> Nope, still spry for a big dude!
[08:36:21] <BillCriswell> I love this natification pattern: http://tympanus.net/Development/NotificationStyles/bar-exploader.html
[08:43:32] <ohcibi> hi... before promises we could req = $.ajax(...) and later req.abort() if needed... how to abort a promise?
[08:44:03] <ohcibi> or better: the xhr that would fullfill the promise?
[08:45:19] <duch_kazatel> you can still call .abort(), can't you?
[08:49:55] <hcker2000> so I created a new file input with $('<input type="file"/>')
[08:50:14] <hcker2000> then i setup my on change event listener which is working fine
[08:50:50] <computer2000> how i hate windows. can anyone tell me how the **** i can switch to that "modern" UI of IE11? i somehow switched to classy mode but cant find a way to go back
[08:50:57] <hcker2000> now when I try to access my saved input nodes .files property its giving me myvar.files is undefined
[08:51:11] <BillCriswell> computer2000: Windows key?
[08:51:27] <Allen300> 'lo
[08:51:38] <computer2000> BillCriswell: takes me to "start"
[08:51:43] <Allen300> This code: http://pastebin.com/KytY0zrE
[08:51:44] <BillCriswell> computer2000: No idea then.
[08:51:48] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 huh?
[08:51:48] <Allen300> So when you have jquery/javascript file that starts with  FileActions={} and then has methods getDefault:function, display:function, etc... how exactly does that work? how are those functions called?
[08:51:56] <BillCriswell> *pets his macbook pro*
[08:52:06] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 are you sure you're running 11?
[08:52:15] <computer2000> duch_kazatel: um i guess
[08:52:17] <computer2000> lemme check
[08:52:44] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 you call them like any other function - FileActions.setDefault();
[08:52:46] <computer2000> yes its 11 on win 8.1
[08:53:25] <duch_kazatel> oh the metro version vs the desktop version?
[08:53:39] <computer2000> duch_kazatel: yes
[08:53:41] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: so is FileActions, like a class?
[08:53:47] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 it's an object.
[08:54:08] <duch_kazatel> computer2000 http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/15045-internet-explorer-modern-restore-windows-8-a.html maybe this has something that'll help you?
[08:54:18] <hcker2000> any one know why my file input node isnt letting me do .files[0]
[08:54:22] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 javascript doesn't have classes.  it has objects with properties.
[08:54:25] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ hcker2000
[08:54:25] <b-ot> hcker2000: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:54:33] <Allen300> ahhh I see
[08:54:53] <Allen300> properties = methods?
[08:55:00] <Allen300> or functions
[08:55:02] <duch_kazatel> properties are properties.
[08:55:08] <duch_kazatel> methods are properties that are functions
[08:55:14] <Allen300> ah ok
[08:55:24] <Allen300> But some functions on there are 'onclick'
[08:55:32] <Allen300> in other words, you don't call them
[08:55:42] <Allen300> Are they supposed to be recognized even though they're in an object?
[08:55:57] <duch_kazatel> example in that paste?
[08:56:21] <hcker2000> trying to get the fiddle to save now
[08:56:49] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: yes. where it says "element.click"
[08:56:56] <PilotTheDune> Hi, could someone explain I can't seem to use replaceWith on an XML node? I've got two nodes, A and B. trying to replace B with A , expecting to end up with two A:s, but instead I end up with just one A node... Why?  http://jsfiddle.net/43ceR/4/
[08:57:30] <tehopeologist> hey all
[08:57:33] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 that's using the DOM - element is the object, which happens to be a DOM node.  .click() is a method that binds an event handler.
[08:57:57] <tehopeologist> for some reason .inArray isn't finding the correct spot in this ul i've given the function
[08:58:14] <tehopeologist> var current = $.inArray('li.active', this);
[08:58:24] <tehopeologist> this being a ul with li's that can have a class of active
[08:58:33] <tehopeologist> it's returning -1
[08:58:46] <duch_kazatel> tehopeologist because .inArray wants an array, not a jquery object.
[08:58:52] <tehopeologist> >_<
[08:58:53] <duch_kazatel> the values in the object are nodes, not strings.
[08:59:04] <duch_kazatel> do you want the index of the current LI relative to the parent?
[08:59:07] <tehopeologist> hmm, and while i understand that, for some reason it's working above this area with an ol
[08:59:13] <tehopeologist> yeah
[08:59:23] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/index/
[08:59:46] <tehopeologist> that's awesome+++
[08:59:51] <tehopeologist> thank you SO much!
[09:00:02] <tehopeologist> much easier than trying to get that stuff into an array then getting a number out of it.
[09:00:02] <tehopeologist> :D
[09:00:04] <tehopeologist> thanks again!
[09:00:33] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: yes so it doesn't matter if the .click() is under an object... it will recognize it as soon the event is excecuted?
[09:00:44] <duch_kazatel> all huh?>
[09:00:54] <duch_kazatel> err, Allen300
[09:00:57] <duch_kazatel> the .click() IS on an object.
[09:01:02] <duch_kazatel> the element is an object.
[09:01:22] <Allen300> yes but it's all under FileActions{}
[09:01:30] <duch_kazatel> and?
[09:01:34] <duch_kazatel> properties are objects themselves.
[09:01:52] <duch_kazatel> functions are objects, too.
[09:01:53] <hcker2000> ok so i had to code pen it
[09:01:53] <hcker2000> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jJIvA
[09:02:05] <Allen300> So if I have that code.. anywhere where that node is clicked on, it will excute those functions?
[09:02:21] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 as long as that method is run, yes.
[09:02:28] <zlude> Hello friends! I need a little help with a example: http://jsfiddle.net/B6m98/ look when load it show all 100 entries. how can i do for load more when scrolling? no load 100 entries in one shot. any ideas? someone can help me with something? thank you!
[09:02:29] <PilotTheDune> going crazy trying to do some basic XML manipulation. Seems like removing works fine but it's impossible to insert any new nodes... Doing a 'replaceWith' will just end up removing a node :S WTF! p
[09:02:49] <PilotTheDune> http://jsfiddle.net/43ceR/4/
[09:02:51] <duch_kazatel> hcker2000 okay, so what are you trying to do here?
[09:02:54] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: I'm guessing the getDefault() method that you're referring to?
[09:03:00] <hcker2000> specifically its erroring on line 17 of the js
[09:03:16] <hcker2000> I'm trying to create a file input node
[09:03:26] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 huh?
[09:03:32] <computer2000> huh
[09:03:36] <hcker2000> then on click of the place holder image it runs a click on said node
[09:03:39] <Allen300> you're saying as long as the method is run
[09:03:43] <hcker2000> you select your file
[09:03:46] <Allen300> which method?
[09:03:58] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 for which click?
[09:04:05] <Allen300> the element.onclick
[09:04:19] <hcker2000> and then on the file input nodes on change event I'm trying to set the src of an image via URL.createObjectURL(imageSlots.fileInput.files[0]);
[09:04:21] <duch_kazatel> there is no element.onclick - there are a few element.click references
[09:04:24] <Allen300> *element.click
[09:04:27] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 i feel like i'm missing something here - can you back up and explain what's up?
[09:04:36] <haleys> I’m doing an AJAX call which can return two different sets of HTML. One HTML set is for when logic passed on my script that AJAX is communicating with, the other HTML set is when there was an error. The html that has an error contains a div that has a class of upload-error. Is there a way in my ajax success to determine if the HTML response contained a div with a class of upload-error?
[09:04:38] <hcker2000> so basic usage of the html5 file methods
[09:04:45] <Allen300> ohh ok I think I understand
[09:05:09] <thebope> if I'd like to get the class of an element, .prop("class") or .attr("class")? Has this debate ever been settled? .prop is the new guy in the arena right? Fit. Sleek. Sexy?
[09:05:32] <duch_kazatel> thebope .prop() is right
[09:05:35] <Allen300>  display:function() has element.click on there... So whenever display method is run... whenever the node is clicked on, it will execute the element.click{}
[09:05:40] <duch_kazatel> and techncially has been for a long time
[09:05:50] <thebope> haleys, if($("div.upload-error").length == 0) { do non error stuff }
[09:05:51] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 i think you need to back up and learn some js basics.
[09:05:58] <thebope> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:06:55] <duch_kazatel> hcker2000 ah, sorry, i don't have any experience with the HTML5 file api.
[09:06:59] <PilotTheDune> after some reading it looks like 'replaceWith' doesn't even work with xml, since it tries to use ''innerHTML'. Any other suggestions on how to replace an XML node??  http://jsfiddle.net/43ceR/4/
[09:07:35] <duch_kazatel> haleys you can pass that data to your .done() hander and, within that, to jquery and operate it like any other part of the DOMN
[09:08:19] <duch_kazatel> PilotTheDune btw use .eq() instead of [1]
[09:08:22] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: So FileActions is an object which has properties/objects inside
[09:08:44] <duch_kazatel> that way you don't have to pass everything through the jquery function again
[09:09:08] <Allen300> and it has methods as well
[09:09:10] <PilotTheDune> duch_kazatel: why?
[09:09:10] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 let's back up to a simpler example
[09:09:20] <duch_kazatel> PilotTheDune because passing through the jquery method again is very slow.
[09:09:28] <duch_kazatel> $(xml).find("node").eq(1) will get you what you want.
[09:09:32] <duch_kazatel> for the selector.
[09:09:36] <duch_kazatel> that's an aside to your issue.
[09:09:50] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 where'd you get this code from?
[09:10:09] <decx> is pilotthedune an expression? seems familiar
[09:10:18] <Allen300>  duch_kazatel an owncloud code
[09:10:45] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: it will get the node with the <xml>... and it'll get the first one
[09:10:46] <duch_kazatel> PilotTheDune you're going to have a lot of trouble using jquery for XML.
[09:11:21] <PilotTheDune> decx: It's a cool song by Slo Burn (band with the singer from Kyuss) so if you're a stoner metal fan it should sound familiar :)
[09:11:42] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 so let's back up to a simpler example - but first of all, what are you trying to accomplish?
[09:11:53] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: I'm trying to understand how that code works
[09:11:54] <decx> oh is that the amazing 4 track ep
[09:12:00] <decx> right, amusing the amazing
[09:12:13] <Allen300> There's an click event that's not working that has worked before
[09:12:13] <decx> good :>
[09:12:55] <Allen300> my own code is normally more simple... has $(document){.... $('#blah').onclick() {}..... });
[09:13:30] <duch_kazatel> Allen300 so which specific line isn't working?
[09:14:10] <PilotTheDune> dutch_kazatel: yeah, I'm amazed by the lack of info I can find...seems like there aren't even any functions for inserting nodes before/after or using replace
[09:14:33] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: 77
[09:14:35] <PilotTheDune> one wonders how hard it could be to implement
[09:14:42] <PilotTheDune> find works perfectly
[09:14:55] <PilotTheDune> so doesn't feel like there's any reason that you shouldn't be able to replace
[09:18:24] <duch_kazatel> PilotTheDune jquery isn't meant for xml - it's meant for html.
[09:18:28] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:18:45] <PilotTheDune> but damn..
[09:20:51] <jop008> Anyone experienced with the themeroller jqMobile? I need 2 themes.  I have a logo can be found here http://ezbuild.touchingservices.nl/logo/EZbuild.png
[09:23:46] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: I understand it now
[09:24:00] <Allen300> duch_kazatel: I think it was just my wording/explanation that wasn't making sense
[09:24:44] <eoss> in the animate function, setting the attributes for 'left: 300px' is it possible to replace 300px with a string?
[09:24:49] <eoss> string variable
[09:26:14] <bl4ckdu5t> I have a '#freeplan', '#proplan', '#premiumplan'
[09:26:30] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm trying to get 'free' or just 'pro'..
[09:27:08] <naeluh> ?
[09:27:16] <naeluh> this #jquery
[09:27:16] <bl4ckdu5t> stored inside var foo
[09:27:25] <naeluh> is*
[09:27:45] <duch_kazatel> back
[09:27:53] <bl4ckdu5t> I did foo.substring(1)
[09:28:01] <bl4ckdu5t> gave me 'freeplan'
[09:28:09] <duch_kazatel> bl4ckdu5t are those elements?
[09:28:10] <bl4ckdu5t> then foo.slice(-4)
[09:28:21] <bl4ckdu5t> but I got plan
[09:28:26] <IanOlson> I have a quick question, I have a click event, that when you click 2 times quickly, it it showing both hidden divs, instead of just one. I'm using BS3 tabs - http://codeshare.io/FJR3h, I want it to timeout from the click event inside the click functio. How would I go about that?
[09:28:26] <bl4ckdu5t> they are strings
[09:28:46] <naeluh> oh are those ids haha
[09:28:55] <bl4ckdu5t> I want to take plan off the string
[09:29:11] <bl4ckdu5t> it's the last four strings in any of the cases
[09:29:21] <duch_kazatel> why not just to foo.replace('plan', '') ?
[09:29:25] <duch_kazatel> *just do
[09:29:36] <naeluh> indexof
[09:29:57] <naeluh> indexOf("plan");
[09:30:03] <bl4ckdu5t> ok I think that'll do it. Thanks
[09:30:06] <duch_kazatel> that's totally unnecessary if you just want to replce place.
[09:30:07] <duch_kazatel> *plan
[09:30:24] <bl4ckdu5t> I'll just replace
[09:30:25] <naeluh> wrd yeah
[09:32:57] <t0biasj0seph> Hi, new to jquery.  If I have a button that calls a function onclick, is it supposed to refresh the whole page or did I accidentally program my function to do so?  I don't want the page to refresh because that is undoing what the function does (removing disabled attributes)
[09:34:22] <duch_kazatel> !paste ! t0biasj0seph
[09:34:27] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ t0biasj0seph
[09:34:27] <b-ot> t0biasj0seph: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:44:43] <t0biasj0seph> b-ot: I've never used jsfiddle.. so on my webpage the edit button is working but here it isn't.. anyways: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=Recgiv3fLA
[09:44:52] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph b-ot is a bot.
[09:45:00] <duch_kazatel> i told it to send that to you ;)
[09:45:20] <t0biasj0seph> lol, oh thanks
[09:45:44] <t0biasj0seph> new to irc too =P
[09:45:44] <duch_kazatel> that being said, let's start by cleaning this up.
[09:46:17] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/aU759/ - see the change i made to the CSS?
[09:46:52] <duch_kazatel> next, don't put onclick handlers inside your HTML - do that in your javascript.
[09:47:05] <t0biasj0seph> okay
[09:47:14] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using?
[09:47:51] <t0biasj0seph> 1.10.2
[09:48:51] <duch_kazatel> one moment
[09:49:58] <FernandoBasso> join #php
[09:50:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/aU759/1/ <- t0biasj0seph check this out
[09:52:24] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: I can't click the edit button..
[09:52:55] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph I didn't fix it, just showing you where to start :)
[09:53:05] <duch_kazatel> do you see the changes I made?
[09:53:27] <t0biasj0seph> yes, I that you moved the onclick call
[09:53:31] <adi__> Can I ask basic questions in this channel?(jquerry related ofc)
[09:53:44] <duch_kazatel> adi__ of course! that's a big part of the point!
[09:53:49] <adi__> awesome
[09:53:57] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph are you familiar with the console?
[09:54:15] <t0biasj0seph> yes
[09:54:29] <duch_kazatel> open it up and click the button - what do you see?
[09:56:04] <adi__> Okay my question: I have a table the table contains two <th> with each 1 <ul> in it i make the lists scroll down on hover... Heres the page: http://212.38.181.38/     so my questions are:  1. I don't want the list to be expanded on opening the page  2. how do i make the list expand downwards and let the other 2 pictures stay fixed on their positions
[09:56:57] <duch_kazatel> adi__ #1 use css to set display: none; on those uls.
[09:57:13] <duch_kazatel> #2 don't use a table for this.
[09:57:22] <adi__> divs or what?
[09:57:28] <duch_kazatel> divs would be perfect.
[09:57:39] <adi__> aight im going to try that, thanks
[09:58:00] <duch_kazatel> sure!
[09:58:08] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: well.. all I see happening is clicking the button hides it?
[09:58:49] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph do you see the error in your console?
[09:59:10] <adi__> duch_kazatel, i made Display:none and it has acutally hidden everything...
[09:59:24] <duch_kazatel> adi__ on the ULs...
[09:59:32] <adi__> yes of course
[09:59:33] <duch_kazatel> just the specific ones you want.
[09:59:44] <duch_kazatel> also: you can't have <ul><img>
[09:59:51] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: I'm not seeing an errors..
[09:59:52] <duch_kazatel> the only valid child of a UL is an <li>
[10:00:01] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph what browser are you in?
[10:00:52] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: Chrome.. nevermind. I'm getting "undefined is not a function"
[10:00:57] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph because i'm getting an error on $(this).class('show') - class isn't a function
[10:01:01] <duch_kazatel> okay cool :)
[10:01:11] <duch_kazatel> i think you want addClass()
[10:01:22] <duch_kazatel> also - don't use .attr(), use .prop() instead.
[10:01:47] <duch_kazatel> and for $(this).removeAttr("disabled", "disabled");, you can just do $(this).prop("disabled", false);
[10:02:24] <duch_kazatel> also also, you can do all of that in one .each() and without checking first.
[10:03:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/aU759/3/ with some other changes.
[10:04:38] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:06:47] <jimi_> How can I do something like this? trying to find the id of aparent, whose child has these classes $('.notify_recipient').find('.recipient-primary.selected').parent().id;   so basically <li id="foo"> i would want that to return foo above in my selector
[10:08:45] <decx> is this coming through?
[10:09:29] <BillCriswell> decx: Nope.
[10:09:42] <decx> weirdest internet outtage ever
[10:10:03] <BillCriswell> decx: Thanks a lot Obama.
[10:10:23] <BillCriswell> jimi_: A little confused by your question.
[10:10:43] <decx> i can understand a dns problem, but not being able to go to your isps site but on reddit is strange
[10:10:48] <decx> even jsfiddle worked
[10:10:57] <decx> this is how bored i was http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ca9Y7/show/
[10:11:00] <BillCriswell> decx: Virus or a trogan or something?
[10:11:07] <BillCriswell> trojan*
[10:11:09] <decx> na isp shit the bed
[10:11:32] <BillCriswell> decx: I feel like I'm stabbing something.
[10:11:33] <BillCriswell> It's nice.
[10:11:52] <decx> activate pollock mode and feel like an artist
[10:12:23] <BillCriswell> jimi_: I think I got you now maybe. You can do $('.foo.bar.baz').closest('.notify_recipient').attr('id')... I think that's what you want.
[10:13:05] <BillCriswell> decx: Could make some sweet ass fireworks.
[10:14:06] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: thx, MUCH cleaner... =)
[10:14:42] <duch_kazatel> back.
[10:15:07] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph see the changes i made?  for instance, you don't need to .each() on an id selector, since there's only ever one thing with that ID.
[10:15:17] <BillCriswell> When I'm in the office by myself I make way too many weird sound effects.
[10:15:29] <decx> BillCriswell yes the first version of the splatter effect i did for my game looked like firework
[10:15:50] <flam_> when i'm coding by myself at home i'm cursing a fucking lot
[10:16:03] <flam_> sometimes
[10:16:17] <BillCriswell> flam_: When I'm not alone I barely talk but when I do it's usually a "fuck?"
[10:16:17] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: yes, thank you!
[10:16:19] <duch_kazatel> when i'm coding i curse a lot
[10:16:19] <flam_> it feels weird to restrain my natural habbits when i'm working for the man

[10:29:58] <drej> honestly, i think it was a bash.org quote
[10:29:59] <drej> from what i remember
[10:30:19] <duch_kazatel> now there's a place i haven't been in like 2 weeks :(
[10:30:30] <drej> bash.org is officially dead
[10:30:30] <drej> RIP
[10:30:37] <duch_kazatel> nooooo!
[10:30:41] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... well I can definitely imagine Carliin saying it so I'll keep thinking that.
[10:30:49] <drej> BillCriswell that's probably better off
[10:31:02] <BillCriswell> That's a pretty nice domain name. I wonder if they sold it.
[10:31:12] <decx> wait really?
[10:31:20] <duch_kazatel> http://bash.org/
[10:31:21] <duch_kazatel> :(
[10:31:31] <duch_kazatel> quick somebody buy it and resurrect it!
[10:31:43] <BillCriswell> RETORT
[10:31:48] <BillCriswell> COUNTER RETORT
[10:31:57] <BillCriswell> Definitely some good ones in there.
[10:32:11] <duch_kazatel> i remember killing HOURS on that one.
[10:32:29] <decx> well time to create a bash clone specifically for #jquery
[10:32:36] <decx> imma be famous
[10:32:55] <BillCriswell> #jquery famous.
[10:32:57] <duch_kazatel> pfff you're already famous
[10:33:00] <drej> there's already a bash clone up
[10:33:02] <drej> but i forget what its claled
[10:33:19] <duch_kazatel> qdb.us
[10:33:22] <duch_kazatel> buuug, y'know...
[10:33:26] <duch_kazatel> *buuut
[10:33:57] <drej> http://www.qdb.us/
[10:33:58] <drej> yeah
[10:34:02] <BillCriswell> There's nothing elegant about that url.
[10:34:04] <drej> i had to find it
[10:34:12] <duch_kazatel> bash was the spin off of QDB iirc.
[10:34:14] <wunz> Creation Date: 1999-03-08T05:00:00Z
[10:34:14] <wunz> Updated Date: 2013-03-04T09:03:15Z
[10:34:14] <wunz> Registry Expiry Date: 2015-03-08T05:00:00Z
[10:34:22] <wunz> You can't get it :) its not expired yet
[10:35:16] <drej> i still have the guys contact info somewhere
[10:35:17] <drej> for bash.org
[10:35:23] <drej> (i hosted it for like 2 months back in 99)
[10:35:40] <duch_kazatel> whaaaat?! drej is internet famous too!
[10:35:51] <drej> lol "famous"
[10:35:52] <decx> and an old fart apparently
[10:36:09] <wunz> apprently :) bash is old
[10:38:17] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: okay.. so my code is cleaned up but I still can't get it working as desired.
[10:38:29] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph okay, so what's not working with what i gave you?
[10:40:04] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: the elements are still not enabling.  I can see that the page reloads and it validates the form data but the fields are never enabled.. they used to be enabled for a few moments while the page was still refreshing
[10:40:04] <drej> duch_kazatel you know, its not working
[10:40:05] <drej> duh
[10:40:06] <drej> :)
[10:40:38] <duch_kazatel> t0biasj0seph it shoulnd't reload.
[10:40:46] <duch_kazatel> mind updating the fiddle?
[10:42:40] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: the fiddle works as desired.. I'm guessing I have some other issue then.. I'm using zend forms so I can start looking there
[10:43:13] <duch_kazatel> yeah that must be part of your problem.
[10:44:46] <t0biasj0seph> duch_kazatel: thank you!
[10:44:57] <duch_kazatel> of course :)
[11:01:50] <Lindrian> i have an array with events i want to find to an element. but it only seems to bind the first event in the list
[11:02:01] <Lindrian> any idea why?
[11:03:44] <duch_kazatel> can you show us your code?
[11:04:01] <duch_kazatel> oh, hah, because you can't use an array.
[11:04:06] <duch_kazatel> should be a space separated string.
[11:06:15] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: hold up
[11:06:59] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: http://hastebin.com/nixuyefuno.coffee
[11:07:12] <Lindrian> it sets both events, but the triggerFunc is not working
[11:07:18] <Lindrian> i think because of the reference
[11:07:45] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing that?
[11:08:25] <Lindrian> cant explain it
[11:08:31] <Lindrian> any idea how to fix it?
[11:08:54] <duch_kazatel> don't loop through an array to add event handlers.
[11:09:25] <Lindrian> i need to bind several events with different function handlers
[11:09:30] <Lindrian> how would i do that otherwise duch_kazatel?
[11:09:36] <Lindrian> its different per element.
[11:10:02] <duch_kazatel> without seeing a more fleshed out example it's very hard to understand what you're trying to do -this is example is binding multiple handlers for a given element.
[11:10:10] <duch_kazatel> $(element.on(eventList.join(' '), function() {}); would take care of the events part.
[11:10:26] <Lindrian> hmm ok.
[11:10:37] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: problem isnt binding events it seems
[11:10:40] <Lindrian> its the function
[11:10:57] <Lindrian> _event.triggerFunc()
[11:12:13] <duch_kazatel> for that to work, eventList[i] needs to return an object that has a triggerFunc() method on it.
[11:12:25] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: and it does
[11:12:26] <naeluh> hey for some reason this code multiples by the amount of inputs that are visible on the screen ? why would that be happening I am just trying to sum all inputs that meet that condition why would multiple by the number of visible inputs ? http://jsfiddle.net/Gd77a/
[11:12:46] <naeluh> although the first go works fine
[11:12:47] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian then it's hard to help without a functioning example.  sorry.
[11:13:23] <jimi_> BillCriswell, sorry, my internet kept going out here
[11:13:33] <duch_kazatel> naeluh $('#grades input').on('change', checkInputs2).trigger('change');
[11:13:36] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: the problem when i print out the values is that the last event handlers function overwrites all the other ones
[11:13:39] <duch_kazatel> on change trigger change?
[11:14:03] <BillCriswell> jimi_: It's all good.
[11:14:03] <naeluh> yeah ignore that
[11:14:10] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian your story is changing... i'm sorry i can't be of more help without the example.
[11:14:25] <naeluh> http://jsfiddle.net/Gd77a/1/
[11:14:41] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: hold on then.
[11:15:01] <naeluh> I guess its cause 2 inputs meet that condition
[11:15:13] <Allen300>  /j #php
[11:15:15] <Allen300> oops
[11:15:35] <jimi_> BillCriswell, have a list of <li class="notify_recipient" id=...>   <span /> <span /> </li> i want to get the id of the <li> whose class is notify_recipient and has a child span record with classes foo and bar was what i wanted to do, without looping if posible
[11:16:20] <naeluh> but that doesnt really explain why input1.val() = 10; input2.val() = 10; would turn out to be 40
[11:16:45] <BillCriswell> jimi_: I think you want $('.foo.bar').closest('.notify_recipient') is what I think you want.
[11:17:04] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Lindrian/836Yf/
[11:17:46] <jimi_> BillCriswell, any chance it will grab one in another <li> outside of its parent?  'closest' sounds scary :P
[11:17:56] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: check your console
[11:18:06] <BillCriswell> closest() goes up the tree till it comes to something it matches then stops.
[11:18:34] <BillCriswell> jimi_: You can also do $('.notify_recipient').has('.foo.bar')
[11:18:35] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian what is the "trigger" event?
[11:18:45] <duch_kazatel> err, input event
[11:18:52] <BillCriswell> jimi_: Which actually makes more sense now that I think about it... if I'm understanding the question right.
[11:18:56] <Lindrian> duch_kazatel: you dont know what input event is?
[11:19:09] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[11:19:10] <duch_kazatel> interesting,.
[11:19:19] <Lindrian> the problem isnt that though
[11:19:23] <Lindrian> its that functions are overwritten
[11:19:28] <Lindrian> as you can see by the console log output
[11:19:35] <jimi_> BillCriswell,
[11:19:37] <jimi_> whoops
[11:19:46] <jimi_> BillCriswell, $('.notify_recipient').has('.recipient-primary.selected'); that worked perfectly ;)
[11:20:17] <BillCriswell> jimi_: Awesome.
[11:20:55] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian one sec.
[11:21:28] <BillCriswell> jimi_: If you ever need to compare stuff you can't use a selector with there's .filter as well, which I'm sure .has uses anyway.
[11:21:50] <BillCriswell> $('.notify_recipient').filter(function(){ return $(this).find('.foo.bar').length > 0; });
[11:21:52] <jimi_> BillCriswell, ah, you the man :)
[11:22:10] <jimi_> BillCriswell, hey at least i tried some combinations before coming in! lol
[11:22:16] <BillCriswell> Exactly.
[11:22:34] <Lindrian> i fixed it
[11:22:37] <Lindrian> closure problemit seems
[11:23:10] <duch_kazatel> this is a really bizarre way to bind events, but ok.  i see a fix, as well.
[11:23:43] <jimi_> BillCriswell, I knew I could do like $('.notify_recipient span').each( function(key,element) {  if ( $(this).hasClass('..') ) ) } or something btu wanted to try to keep it to 1 liner
[11:23:48] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah hah derp.
[11:24:00] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian for loops don't have scop.
[11:24:25] <BillCriswell> jimi_: Yeah, one liner actually helps the readability there so it's good.
[11:24:28] <duch_kazatel> *scope
[11:24:42] <BillCriswell> Usually I'm not a fan of using something just becuase it's a "one liner".
[11:24:58] <duch_kazatel> one line !== good
[11:25:16] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Else, we’d all be using perl, right? :)
[11:26:03] <BillCriswell> I haven't seen any perl in a while.
[11:26:10] <washuu> Hiya
[11:26:44] <washuu> perl. What's the problem with it? Promoting bad habits?
[11:27:01] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[11:27:12] <duch_kazatel> just a different syntax.
[11:27:16] <t0biasj0seph> New question.. does anyone know of a jquery plugin for my form so all text is displayed until double clicked or enabled, then all elements are input boxes?  I have seen people code it by hand.  I will be using it for a Zend form with doctrine..
[11:27:34] <duch_kazatel> don't do double-click imo.
[11:27:59] <BillCriswell> I've missed so much functionality behind a double click on websites haha
[11:28:04] <duch_kazatel> but that's relatively simple to setup yourself with contenteditables
[11:29:25] <washuu> Honestly... I was amazed by the possibilities of jQuery and Ajax. More ways to do a job than I wanted to larn ;-)
[11:29:30] <BillCriswell> t0biasj0seph: http://jsbin.com/ravibuna/13/edit I liked this approach I came up with a bit ago.
[11:30:06] <duch_kazatel> washuu very few ways to do it "right" imo.
[11:30:11] <duch_kazatel> and it's pretty easy stuff overall.
[11:31:56] <goldr046> that looks like real data
[11:32:06] <BillCriswell> t0biasj0seph: I basically just style an input to look like plain text haha.
[11:32:22] <BillCriswell> goldr046: I used http://www.json-generator.com/
[11:32:23] <duch_kazatel> niiice
[11:32:26] <goldr046> hello, sophie bass
[11:32:40] <dmsuperman> t0biasj0seph: that's called "edit in place" and there are many solutions
[11:32:41] <goldr046> no hello, sophie bass
[11:34:15] <washuu> @duch: Then I will put some of my first experiments onto my beloved folder that can be reached at http://http://77.47.53.39/have_fun/
[11:34:39] <duch_kazatel> washuu hrm?
[11:35:04] <t0biasj0seph> dmsurperman: thanks! wasn't sure what to call it
[11:35:09] <BillCriswell> Going to try out watchify.
[11:35:14] <BillCriswell> Seems fun.
[11:35:53] <washuu> Had to coopy one
[11:36:28] <washuu> Is supposed to fill one <tr>
[11:37:01] <naeluh> this is bs
[11:37:02] <naeluh> http://jsfiddle.net/Gd77a/2/
[11:37:25] <naeluh> I am just trying to meet  a condtion and count why is doubling christ !
[11:38:01] <naeluh> count all inputs that meet a condition
[11:38:09] <duch_kazatel> give us a working example maybe?
[11:38:14] <Ackis> hey everyone, I think I'm missing something basic with jquery but my google-fu is failing me. :( http://jsfiddle.net/Ackis/G5E86/1/ that code is removing all of the class checkempty instead of just the specific reference
[11:38:44] <duch_kazatel> Ackis because you're getting every tr that's closest to every .checkempty
[11:38:50] <naeluh> ok yeah one sec
[11:38:52] <duch_kazatel> you want $(this) instead of your checkempty selector
[11:39:54] <Ackis> duch_kazatel: that's what I thought but when I tried it: $(".this").closest("tr").hide() the behaviour didn't change at all
[11:40:02] <washuu> I know. Just improvising here. The calling script is http://77.47.53.39/cgi-bin/testx3.php
[11:40:02] <duch_kazatel> Ackis no quotes.
[11:40:04] <duch_kazatel> $(this)
[11:40:09] <Ackis> damnit
[11:40:16] <washuu> I'm ashamed. Unfinished part.
[11:40:26] <duch_kazatel> you want the object this, not the string 'this' ;)
[11:41:06] <Ackis> duch_kazatel: yeah it was a typo here, $(this) still doesn't seem to work (nothing gets hidden in this case)
[11:41:27] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[11:41:53] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah okay.
[11:42:01] <duch_kazatel> your code doesn't make any sense :)
[11:42:09] <Neobenedict> anyone around, i have the code here http://pastebin.com/HsNdWBCA however it gives the error "TypeError invalid 'in' operand a" any help?
[11:43:00] <Ackis> duch_kazatel: I've tried things that make sense, things that don't make sense
[11:43:24] <duch_kazatel> Ackis the issue is that you have no context of which one is which.
[11:43:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/G5E86/2/
[11:43:34] <duch_kazatel> does this work?
[11:44:30] <Absolute0> When to add a class and when to add a data value?
[11:44:49] <duch_kazatel> Neobenedict because your data isn't valid JSON
[11:44:54] <Ackis> it works a lot better than what I was doing, I can go from there.  I understood that it didn't have context but I though the $(this) should have worked (alas it didn't)... thanks, I'll take what you did and work it out so I understand :)
[11:45:00] <duch_kazatel> Absolute0 use classes for styles, and data for, well, data.
[11:45:18] <duch_kazatel> Ackis $(this) works if you give it context - what you had before what ephemeral.
[11:45:29] <duch_kazatel> aaand lunch
[11:46:16] <washuu> jsfiddle... That looks like some platform for my needs!
[11:46:41] <Absolute0> duch_lunch: I need to be able to tell if a button was pressed the second time it is clicked.
[11:46:41] <Neobenedict> duch_lunch: how do I turn it into valid json?
[11:46:48] <duch_lunch> lol i'
[11:46:52] <duch_lunch> *i'm leaving for a bit folks.
[11:46:56] <duch_lunch> i'll be back in an hour or so.
[11:46:58] <Ackis> no food 4 u duch_lunch :)
[11:47:02] <washuu> cu
[11:47:09] <duch_lunch> Neobenedict fix it on your server.
[11:47:33] <duch_lunch> Absolute0 that seems... wrong.  if you don't get help i'll be back later and will look.  bye folks.
[11:49:41] <BillCriswell> Laitder
[11:49:50] <BillCriswell> decx: Internet still broken
[11:49:51] <BillCriswell> ?
[11:58:30] <Neobenedict> how can I properly escape json from PHP for jquery to parse
[11:58:35] <Neobenedict> looks like jquery isn't parsing it right
[12:07:15] <Neobenedict> i managed to get it to work after setting header('content-type: applicattion/json')
[12:07:30] <Neobenedict> o and now it's broken again
[12:07:31] <Neobenedict> awesome
[12:07:33] <PantsOfChoco> duch nooooooo
[12:07:50] <Neobenedict> ok removing content-type = json fixes it
[12:12:13] <jbraeg> code.jquery.com's ssl cert is expired, i haven't seen anything else about it
[12:12:16] <jbraeg> https://code.jquery.com/
[12:12:25] <BillCriswell> Neobenedict: You spelled application wrong.
[12:12:52] <Neobenedict> I know
[12:12:56] <Neobenedict> i'm on two computers
[12:13:11] <Neobenedict> didn't put in the effort to type it properly
[12:13:12] <Neobenedict> :P
[12:13:18] <BillCriswell> Oh ok, just making sure.
[12:13:53] <Neobenedict> yeah, fair enough

[12:15:13] <pouncehu1> ok fine dont fix it
[12:15:20] <pouncehu1> yell at me for not using pastebin
[12:15:23] <pouncehu1> great plan
[12:15:28] <jbraeg> relax man
[12:15:31] <Neobenedict> irc has rate limits
[12:15:39] <Neobenedict> so people will interrupt you if you paste large amounts of text
[12:15:40] <NoiseEee> don't use https?  whats the problem pouncehu1?
[12:15:50] <NoiseEee> don't link to jquery.com for a copy of jquery on your site
[12:16:01] <jbraeg> NoiseEee: what's the point is a jquery CDN if you can't use it?
[12:16:08] <BillCris_> Lol what?
[12:16:13] <jbraeg> http://code.jquery.com/
[12:16:17] <jbraeg> "jQuery CDN – Latest Stable Versions"
[12:16:19] <kpap> eno, on a hard drive.
[12:16:24] <Neobenedict> use google's
[12:16:30] <kpap> thx
[12:16:41] <BillCris_> What just happened?
[12:17:03] <jbraeg> it's an expired certificate
[12:17:04] <jbraeg> it should be fixed
[12:17:17] <Neobenedict> what's the best thing to fade in a block of html onto a page (.append)
[12:17:57] <BillCris_> Neobenedict: Probably the .fadeIn/Out methods...
[12:18:00] <systemfault> Just use google’s CDN like everyone else.
[12:18:01] <systemfault>  :P
[12:18:11] <NoiseEee> jbraeg: yep im sure it will be
[12:18:15] <jbraeg> ok, that doesn't fix the underlying issue
[12:18:23] <jbraeg> which is that the ssl certificate is expired
[12:18:29] <jbraeg> and if you want to download a jquery release
[12:18:30] <Neobenedict> BillCris_: I have about 6-7 of these blocks of code I need to fade in, but I'd like them to do it one after another. Is that possible?
[12:18:33] <NoiseEee> jbraeg: im sure it will be fixed shortly
[12:18:36] <jbraeg> you can't trust the remote computer
[12:18:38] <kpap> eno, on a hard drive.
[12:18:41] <BillCris_> Neobenedict: Yes.
[12:18:45] <Neobenedict> The funciton will be called 7 times in a fraction of a second
[12:18:47] <Neobenedict> I'd like to queue them
[12:18:51] <Neobenedict> function*
[12:19:51] <BillCris_> Neobenedict: Right, would need to use recursion.
[12:20:12] <BillCris_> Neobenedict: http://www.paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/ would be a good read for what you're trying to do.
[12:21:13] <systemfault> A fourth way could be using promises
[12:21:18] <Neobenedict> sec, mysql is being very slow
[12:21:38] <BillCris_> Yes.
[12:21:38] <systemfault> Actually… using promises would be cleaner.
[12:21:53] <BillCris_> I like clearInterval lol
[12:22:03] <BillCris_> I mean setInterval
[12:22:11] <hamcore> i need to transform a json file like [{"id": 1, "name": "First Name"},{"id": 2, "name": "Second Name"}] to [{"First Name", "Second Name"}], how can i do this?
[12:22:50] <systemfault> hamcore: $.map(myArray, function(obj) { return obj.name; });
[12:23:06] <hamcore> systemfault, great, thank u.
[12:23:17] <systemfault> hamcore: If I understood correctly.. because your expected result isn’t valid JS
[12:26:19] <BillCris_> The delay way really doesn't seem terrible either.
[12:28:18] <BillCris_> It's pretty tough finding a good demo of sequential with promises.
[12:31:54] <davidbrear_> Anyone know the status on the SSL Cert that expired this afternoon?
[12:32:23] <NoiseEee> will be fixed...
[12:32:57] <BillCris_> Jesus lol
[12:33:03] <BillCris_> People are in a panic.
[12:33:49] <NoiseEee> im amazed so many people use it as a CDN
[12:33:54] <NoiseEee> what a waste
[12:33:58] <NoiseEee> esp. if you're doing ssl
[12:34:27] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, if you are around , were you able to remove the navbar completely from your hacking up of the dashboard ? the <nav> </nav> tag is integral to the code and is used in tonnes of places so on removing it the code vanishes :(
[12:35:05] <BillCris_> Where is there a suggestion to use that source? Not even seeing one.
[12:35:52] <NoiseEee> well it says "jQuery CDN" on http://code.jquery.com/
[12:36:03] <BillCris_> Ahh.
[12:36:13] <NoiseEee> but a) CDNs for JS = lol    and b) terrible idea to use that instead of a CDN like google if you do in fact choose to use one
[12:38:03] <davidbrear_> it works fine most of the time except when the cert expires
[12:38:22] <NoiseEee> yeah but its a) another DNS lookup/call
[12:38:29] <davidbrear_> k
[12:38:30] <NoiseEee> b) extra slow if its SSL (for the people comlpaining)
[12:38:37] <NoiseEee> just.... serve from your app.
[12:38:53] <NoiseEee> there are so many versions of jquery in the wild anyways, depending on a cached version is unlikely as well
[12:39:23] <davidbrear_> rather not have assets on my webserver if I don't have to
[12:39:39] <k20-aaron> is there an ETA for a fix?
[12:40:24] <BillCris_> k20-aaron:
[12:40:45] <BillCris_> Hm, that copy did nothing lol.
[12:40:48] <BillCris_> k20-aaron: https://twitter.com/jquery/status/494922194351181824
[12:40:49] <b-ot> BillCris_: @jquery: We have had multiple reports that the SSL certificate for http://t.co/Pqa7Wy81AS has expired. We are on it now and will keep you posted.
[12:40:59] <k20-aaron> ahh okay. thanks
[12:42:54] <Absolute0> How can I select a tr with a td that contains a case insensitive text?
[12:43:28] <Absolute0> for example, all trs with 'FF' or 'ff' in one of the tds.
[12:44:05] <NoiseEee> Absolute0: in general, that kind of querying is slow and not performant
[12:44:18] <NoiseEee> Absolute0: anyways you'll have to do it twice.
[12:44:26] <Absolute0> NoiseEee: I need a table search plugin
[12:44:33] <Absolute0> Can you suggest a light weight one?
[12:44:44] <NoiseEee> not familiar with any, sorry :|
[12:45:17] <Absolute0> NoiseEee: how many table rows would I need to have to see the lag with has:contains(key) ?
[12:45:48] <NoiseEee> not sure to be honest, prob depends on the contents of each td really
[12:48:11] <duch_kazatel> http://brian.io/lawnchair/ -> "A Lawnchair is sorta like a couch except smaller and outside."
[12:49:08] <decx> i thought couches were an appropriate lawnchair in america, have i been lied to?
[12:49:30] <duch_kazatel> decx only in college towns.  they're also perfectly acceptable fire pits if you're in my city.
[12:50:35] <kpap> bls: google hasn't shown anything for me, and #aufs is empty
[12:53:26] <drej> lol duch_kazatel
[12:53:30] <drej> lawnchair explanation
[12:53:33] <BillCris_> I've used couches outside.
[12:54:13] <BillCris_> We were also doing this though: https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/1902930_10100876872188218_3443100474560135790_n.jpg?oh=746ede2b3cdeb247b4ba8e0fd76df7e9&oe=54577FF9&__gda__=1415099250_fa7ce82e7b912f7da012915e5f701e63
[12:56:13] <Neobenedict> hmm, I can't get this fade to work at all
[12:56:32] <gnarf> gratz to #jquery's newest @ duch_kazatel !
[12:56:41] <Neobenedict> http://pastebin.com/YT8waiS7
[12:56:46] <Neobenedict> what am I doing wrong here
[12:56:55] <BillCris_> So I can't make fun of him anymore?
[12:57:05] <systemfault> Shit.
[12:57:06] <systemfault> :(
[12:57:09] <duch_kazatel> http://www.techsavvyed.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/over-enthusiastic-kermit.gif
[12:57:19] <BillCris_> Damn he is freaking out.
[12:57:26] <Neobenedict> and never mind
[12:57:30] <Neobenedict> forgot my _
[12:57:35] <duch_kazatel> dat kermit.  and thank you to gnarf and ryanneufeld - you guys are awesome.
[12:57:38] <BillCris_> Neobenedict: You would want to .delay() then .fadeOut() with that approach.
[12:57:49] <Neobenedict> i want it to fade in
[12:57:50] <BillCris_> Don't break IRC duch_kazatel.
[12:57:55] <duch_kazatel> too late :(
[12:58:12] <ryanneufeld> rule 1) Don't be a dick :P
[12:58:20] <duch_kazatel> ever!
[12:58:47] <Neobenedict> BillCris_: it needs to fade in from nothing
[12:58:51] <Neobenedict> so hide() then fadein()?
[12:59:58] <BillCris_> Neobenedict: What's the element starting off as?
[13:00:08] <Neobenedict> i think i got it
[13:00:10] <Neobenedict> a div
[13:00:12] <NoiseEee> Neobenedict: sure or just set its style to hidden
[13:00:19] <NoiseEee> rather than call 'hide()' on it
[13:01:23] <Neobenedict> woo it works! and with a delay
[13:01:29] <BillCris_> Neobenedict: http://jsbin.com/viral/1/edit here's a really easy to follow way with recursion, not the most efficient I'm sure but it would be easy to adjust.
[13:01:50] <BillCris_> Neobenedict: If you're using the delay just make sure you're multiplying the delay by the index you're on.
[13:02:15] <Neobenedict> BillCris_: what I did it just set a variable extraDelay and after each funciton call add 600 to it
[13:02:28] <Neobenedict> and then use that as the delay before fadein
[13:02:32] <Neobenedict> works perfectly
[13:02:39] <BillCris_> notgnarf: Good disguise.
[13:02:59] <BillCris_> Master of it, one might say.
[13:04:10] <Mushr00m> Hi guys !
[13:05:12] <Mushr00m> I've created a custom plugin that change all my forms selects to dropdown to be able to style them. My issue is that I can't figure how to handle the keyboard Tab when to user goes from one field to an other
[13:05:18] <Mushr00m> any ideas or examples ?
[13:08:09] <BillCris_> decx: reddit.com is giving me an invalid url today haha
[13:14:35] <kpap> hey i'm looking for a channel to talk about future trends in commercial buildings / retail etc
[13:15:57] <gnarf> kpap unlikely to find one on freenode, I doubt people who talk about those things know how to IRC
[13:21:40] <alison> whats the most efficient method of pushing page content off screen? I'm trying to implement a vertical nav but theres a lot of stuttering
[13:22:30] <duch_kazatel> alison could you clarify what you mean?
[13:25:16] <alison> sure. I'm using bootstrap, and rather than have the drop down menu, I'd like the page content to slide off screen to the left, revealing a vertical navigation menu. I've tried pushing it off with right: and margin-rght, but theres a noticeable drop in frame rate during the animation
[13:25:32] <alison> is that clearer?
[13:25:59] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.
[13:26:34] <duch_kazatel> i can't remember the name for it, but there was an article i read a while back about doing that.
[13:27:41] <DeoSama> hey guys, i'm trying to do some php coding from some existing code
[13:27:42] <duch_kazatel> http://callmenick.com/2014/03/26/slide-and-push-menus-with-css3-transitions/ this might be iut.
[13:27:49] <DeoSama> and i need to do some heredoc html
[13:28:00] <duch_kazatel> DeoSama you'll probably have better luck in #php
[13:28:08] <DeoSama> however, inside the html there's a javascript, or jquery, variable named "$dialog"
[13:28:14] <DeoSama> and it's messing everything up
[13:28:21] <DeoSama> i can just delete the '$' right?
[13:28:26] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:28:31] <DeoSama> shit, really?
[13:28:40] <duch_kazatel> unless you update that variable everywhere else it's getting used
[13:28:48] <DeoSama> yeah, that's what i'll do
[13:29:02] <DeoSama> then it's ok to declare it like "var dialog = foo;" right?
[13:29:18] <duch_kazatel> somewhere else, yeah.  as long as you change all your references.
[13:29:38] <DeoSama> awesome!
[13:29:39] <DeoSama> thanks :D
[13:29:42] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:29:44] <alison> thanks duch, ill give it a go
[13:31:06] <duch_kazatel> man with this op i wonder if i should nick myself to my actual name.
[13:32:05] <BillCriswell> What do you go by? Rob?
[13:32:46] <duch_kazatel> Robert
[13:33:04] <BillCriswell> Not a fan of nicknames?
[13:33:09] <mooncup> yo Vivekananda_y510
[13:33:12] <mooncup> im at home now if you're around
[13:33:19] <duch_kazatel> i know a rob, robbie, robby, and bob.
[13:33:20] <mooncup> I can look in to it more completely now if you want
[13:33:26] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Makes sense.
[13:33:33] <mooncup> Vivekananda_y510: we left the nav bar in our version
[13:33:47] <BillCriswell> I don't know if I could handle being called William.
[13:34:06] <duch_kazatel> how many Bills do you know?
[13:34:35] <duch_kazatel> crosby and murray do not count.
[13:34:36] <BillCriswell> Eh like... 5-6?
[13:34:40] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[13:34:59] <Mushr00m> do you guys know a good Jquery plugin to transform forms elements to dropdowns, radio buttons etc… ? I mean a light one and that just does this not any other fancy stuff
[13:35:16] <Mushr00m> just make it possible to customize it with css
[13:35:18] <alison> duch, are the 'push' animations smooth for you on that page? they're just as bad as my current implementation
[13:35:37] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That's including my Dad and my Grandfather and my unclue on my Mom's site haha
[13:35:40] <duch_kazatel> alison they're pleny smooth, yeah.
[13:35:49] <BillCriswell> Mom's side*
[13:35:53] <duch_kazatel> Mushr00m maybe the one from Malsup? http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[13:35:57] <alison> what browser are you using?
[13:36:01] <duch_kazatel> FF
[13:36:20] <alison> ah ok. maybe its just webkit
[13:36:29] <duch_kazatel> you're in safari?
[13:36:36] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, yeah coz trying to remove it and jsut get the graphs is giving me a nightmare :(
[13:36:40] <alison> yeah, v6
[13:37:04] <mooncup> ok Vivekananda_y510
[13:37:08] <mooncup> link me to your shit again
[13:37:09] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I havent yet figured out how to give the graphs my data instead of where ever it is getting data from coz I still dont know where the data input is being obtained
[13:37:11] <mooncup> Ill have a proper look
[13:37:15] <Vivekananda_y510> sure one sec
[13:37:19] <Vivekananda_y510> lol my shit indeed
[13:37:27] <mooncup> lol its a figure of speech
[13:37:31] <Vivekananda_y510> lemme start the localtunnel
[13:37:35] <Mushr00m> duch_kazatel : I don't think it's what I need, I just need to transform selects to dropdowns and radio also to divs etc
[13:37:45] <mooncup> I didn't use their graphs
[13:37:45] <Mushr00m> it's more for building a nice UI
[13:37:49] <mooncup> I just downloaded flot and used that
[13:38:04] <duch_kazatel> woops you're right.
[13:38:20] <duch_kazatel> Mushr00m you could always do a custom build of jquery ui for those bits.
[13:38:27] <alison> its strange that the animations are smooth in iOS simulator, but lag on the desktop safari
[13:38:42] <duch_kazatel> wonder why.
[13:39:03] <Mushr00m> duch_kazatel : I've started writting my own plugins but the accessibilty with keyboard lile tabs and arrow kills me
[13:39:14] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I just removed the nav and this happens  http://6526ec6c.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/index3.html
[13:39:19] <Vivekananda_y510> lemme put it back in a sec
[13:39:20] <mooncup> alison: have you tried reducing the windows size of safai and seeing how it runs?
[13:39:23] <Mushr00m> *like
[13:39:47] <duch_kazatel> Mushr00m have you checked out the tabindex?
[13:39:54] <NoiseEee> alison: do you use dropshadows, etc?
[13:40:20] <Mushr00m> duch_kazatel : nope don't know that
[13:40:30] <NoiseEee> alison: http://jankfree.org/ is a good resource too.
[13:40:42] <mooncup> right Vivekananda_y510
[13:40:44] <Vivekananda_y510> shoot messed up something
[13:40:44] <mooncup> fix it again
[13:40:46] <mooncup> I've had an idea
[13:40:54] <Vivekananda_y510> one sec
[13:40:55] <mooncup> link me to that gist you linked earlier
[13:42:16] <alison> mooncup: yeah, even at the smallest width on desktop safari, the animation still lags. NoiseEee: nope, no shadows. I'm just adding a class to the wrapper, and the css is just right: with a trantisiton
[13:42:17] <Vivekananda_y510> one sec
[13:42:24] <Vivekananda_y510> https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/baa475211fb2cda3dad3
[13:43:34] <mooncup> can you fix it too?
[13:43:48] <mooncup> we just need to extract the info from the nav into a json format instead
[13:43:59] <mooncup> then we can access that instead
[13:44:13] <mooncup> but I need to see the nav properly to get the info
[13:46:00] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, got back the page
[13:46:05] <Vivekananda_y510> please try again the link
[13:47:03] <pthoopth> was wondering if anyone else had problems loading jquery from the site.  All of sudden my web pages stopped loading CSS but now they are fine again.
[13:47:21] <duch_kazatel> pthoopth what links are you using?
[13:48:06] <Vivekananda_y510> also the whole js page that is doing the shit is here :  http://localhost:8082/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/js/app.config.js
[13:48:33] <pthoopth> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
[13:48:40] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, sorry this one : http://localhost:8082/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/js/app.min.js
[13:48:46] <duch_kazatel> pthoopth that's part of the problem: don't use that link :)
[13:48:55] <w00tb3ast> can I have a listener for an on click in DOM ready for a link that only gets added to the page after the dom is loaded?
[13:48:58] <pthoopth> what link should I use
[13:49:05] <duch_kazatel> pthoopth read more here: http://blog.jquery.com/2014/07/03/dont-use-jquery-latest-js/
[13:49:20] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast nope.  you want to use event delegation in that case.
[13:50:10] <w00tb3ast> so if i did something like document.delegate('class', 'click', function(event){ }); on my class it would work?
[13:50:23] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast use .on() instead - .delegate was deprecated a while ago.
[13:50:30] <w00tb3ast> fair enough
[13:50:36] <duch_kazatel> you want $('parent').on('event', 'selector', function() {});
[13:51:01] <duch_kazatel> where 'parent' is as deep in the tree as you can make it
[13:51:05] <duch_kazatel> if that makes sense.
[13:51:10] <w00tb3ast> yup makes sense
[13:51:12] <mooncup> 21:48 < Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, sorry this one : http://localhost:8082/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/js/app.min.js
[13:51:13] <w00tb3ast> I will try it now
[13:51:16] <mooncup> thats a localhost link lol
[13:52:44] <Vivekananda_y510> lol sorry I meant :
[13:53:16] <mooncup> ok
[13:53:17] <mooncup> nm
[13:53:19] <mooncup> found it
[13:53:20] <mooncup> "/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/ajax/dashboard.html"
[13:53:32] <mooncup> ok
[13:53:38] <mooncup> at the top of that function
[13:53:48] <mooncup> var a = "/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/ajax/dashboard.html";
[13:53:49] <Vivekananda_y510> http://6526ec6c.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/js/app.min.js
[13:54:21] <Vivekananda_y510> just need to change localhost to the ngrok.com
[13:54:50] <mooncup> then comment out lines 73,74
[13:54:58] <mooncup> and 68 and 79
[13:55:00] <mooncup> and see if it works
[13:55:33] <mooncup> its kinda hacky but it might do the job
[13:56:43] <Vivekananda_y510> one sec. those lines inside the app.min right ?
[13:57:08] <mooncup> hang on
[13:57:10] <mooncup> ill fork it
[13:57:17] <Vivekananda_y510> okay
[13:57:32] <Vivekananda_y510> it is on git but not updated to current version
[13:58:11] <mooncup> https://gist.github.com/mooncup/b4bb37e589e86d933f1f
[13:58:12] <mooncup> try that
[13:58:15] <mooncup> not sure if it will work
[13:58:39] <mooncup> could also comment out the try catch actually
[14:01:13] <JensB> Hi
[14:01:57] <JensB> I have a jquery question. Anyone care to help?
[14:02:12] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ JensB
[14:02:13] <b-ot> JensB: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:02:14] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:02:49] <JensB> Just started experimenting with jquery: http://castlemountain.dk/MIRC/mirc.php
[14:03:13] <JensB> is is possible to declare two "dialog" as I'm trying on the above page?
[14:03:25] <duch_kazatel> you want multiple dialogs on the same page?
[14:03:47] <JensB> Yes
[14:03:55] <duch_kazatel> first things first - is your console open?
[14:04:00] <JensB> Yes
[14:04:04] <JensB> chrome browser
[14:04:11] <duch_kazatel> awesome - so you see the syntax error?
[14:04:22] <JensB> yes: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[14:04:37] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you're missing a closing curly
[14:06:16] <JensB> Added closing curly, still doesnøt work, please see: http://castlemountain.dk/MIRC/mirc.php
[14:06:29] <robertmaxrees> still missing one.
[14:11:02] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I will try commenting out the entire try catch . did you look at the whole page ?
[14:11:14] <mooncup> sort of
[14:11:20] <mooncup> this is kind of a stab in the dark
[14:15:09] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, okay so commenting out line 67 to 79
[14:18:59] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, I commented out and yhou an see the output on refresh
[14:19:00] <Vivekananda_y510> lol
[14:19:22] <mooncup> did you add the line at the top too?
[14:26:51] <Vivekananda_y510> one sec
[14:34:24] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup I added your function and commented the earlier one : http://6526ec6c.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/index3.html
[14:49:44] <Erendrake> Hi everyone

[14:57:26] <Erendrake> cool, I am trying to add some basic keyboard support for the sortable control and i am having trouble getting the built in events to fire
[14:59:09] <Erendrake> I can reorder the elements in the list, but i have actions that are bound to the normal events and they are not firing
[14:59:24] <robertmaxrees> how do you have things bound?
[14:59:30] <Erendrake> in the options
[14:59:50] <robertmaxrees> mind creating a use case on jsfiddle?
[15:00:39] <Erendrake> sure, give me a bit. Its a bit complicated because they are getting consumed by an angularjs directive
[15:00:42] <Erendrake> bbiab
[15:00:45] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:00:49] <robertmaxrees> no need to go that far.
[15:00:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:01:55] <Erendrake> So i am just trying to implement the simplest aria-grabbed support that will let you move the current element up or down.
[15:03:29] <Erendrake> i saw something on stackoverflow talking about using triggers to manually fire the sortable events?
[15:03:47] <robertmaxrees> you can .trigger('event'), yeah.
[15:03:47] <Erendrake> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4911124/moving-an-item-programmatically-with-jquery-sortable-while-still-triggering-even
[15:04:16] <robertmaxrees> i don't recall all the events that exist inside of sortable though.
[15:05:51] <Erendrake> before we get any further i want to thank you for your time.
[15:06:01] <robertmaxrees> of course :)
[15:06:07] <mooncup> Vivekananda_y510: that's good right?
[15:06:10] <mooncup> or is that not what you wanted?
[15:06:44] <Erendrake> I think i can fiddle this in a few ill brb
[15:06:49] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[15:07:02] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, no I want the aread chart and no nav strip or anything
[15:07:07] <Vivekananda_y510> just the area chart
[15:07:14] <robertmaxrees> just do the simplest case you can :)
[15:07:15] <mooncup> remove the nav
[15:07:21] <mooncup> and see if it works
[15:07:51] <mooncup> oh you took out the changes?
[15:07:53] <mooncup> I only just looked
[15:08:25] <mooncup> can you commit the latest you have to git
[15:08:28] <mooncup> i can have a play around
[15:09:25] <mooncup> though I need to go to bed now so it will have to be on saturday
[15:09:26] <mooncup> sorry :(
[15:11:51] <Vivekananda_y510> sure one sec
[15:12:01] <Vivekananda_y510> but how will you get the git ?
[15:12:09] <Vivekananda_y510> do I have to uploadd it to a repo remotely ?
[15:14:00] <Vivekananda_y510> mooncup, ?
[15:14:47] <Vivekananda_y510> gone already I guesss
[15:34:29] <Erendrake> Alright! i made a jsfiddle that I belive shows the basic issue im trying to figure out.
[15:34:38] <Erendrake> http://jsfiddle.net/nUWs7/
[15:34:57] <Erendrake> if you tab into the Foo li
[15:35:07] <Erendrake> and press up or down
[15:35:10] <Erendrake> i would expect two alerts
[15:35:20] <Erendrake> the key name and "bang!"
[15:35:51] <Erendrake> i have a feeling i am just not understanding triggers :)
[15:35:59] <robertmaxrees> it's loading - one sec.
[15:36:46] <robertmaxrees> where is the keyname alert supposed to come from?
[15:36:49] <robertmaxrees> i only see one.
[15:36:55] <Erendrake> opps
[15:37:11] <Erendrake> forgot to save again
[15:37:23] <Erendrake> http://jsfiddle.net/nUWs7/1/
[15:38:18] <robertmaxrees> ah, okay, you're confused aboput a few things :)
[15:38:28] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:38:29] <Erendrake> sweet
[15:40:17] <robertmaxrees> sorry need to finish something real quick.
[15:40:38] <Erendrake> all good
[15:40:43] <Erendrake> thank you
[15:43:42] <axe9|work> howdy
[15:45:07] <Erendrake> hi there axe
[15:45:30] <axe9|work> Erendrake: you guys friendly to jquery idiots?
[15:45:42] <Erendrake> I just got here :)
[15:45:51] <Erendrake> so far so good
[15:45:57] <Erendrake> fire away
[15:46:03] <axe9|work> All yhe developers left for the day... and I have this js that is killing me.
[15:46:17] <axe9|work> <-- CS degree, but is a bad programmer and doesn't mess with JQ much
[15:46:28] <robertmaxrees> lol it's all good :)
[15:47:04] <axe9|work> So I have this pretty large validation routine that fires off 4 web service calls
[15:47:31] <axe9|work> It used to do three, but I added one by copying an existing one that used the same structure and changing the appropriate names so it called my new web service
[15:48:06] <axe9|work> But when I submit the form, all four fire off, and I get the response headers fine from the other ones, but the one I added doesn't return anything
[15:48:29] <axe9|work> Rather, it returns: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
[15:49:07] <axe9|work> And in the console I get "Only one root el;ement is allowed.
[15:49:32] <introspectr5> axe9|work how sure are you about the webservice?
[15:49:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your backend isn't setup to respond correctly maybe?>
[15:49:58] <axe9|work> introspectr5: if I execute the SQL it calls by itself, it works fine
[15:50:21] <axe9|work> oh shii...
[15:50:23] <Erendrake> axe, maybe you should change the new service call to point to one of the other endpoints
[15:50:23] <introspectr5> can you paste the webservice view?
[15:50:32] <robertmaxrees> looks like he figured it out :)
[15:50:49] <axe9|work> yeah I might have, let me confirm -_-
[15:51:12] <Erendrake> so robert, want to unconfuse me? the suspense is killing me
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> Erendrake sorry, playing around.
[15:51:58] <robertmaxrees> i thought you had a problem with scope but you didn't.  i may or may not be drinking at work.
[15:51:59] <Erendrake> take your time :)
[15:53:37] <axe9|work> Nope that wasn't it
[15:53:47] <axe9|work> could have contributed but not the full issue I think
[15:53:58] <robertmaxrees> they all fire correctly, Erendrake.  stop fires when you drag an item.
[15:54:05] <robertmaxrees> and release the mouse.
[15:55:13] <Erendrake> it does, i was just looking for a way to make the keypress fire the stop event
[15:55:41] <axe9|work> If I pastbin two sections of code would that help?
[15:55:59] <Erendrake> axe: cant hurt :)
[15:56:18] <introspectr5> except if its asp.net
[15:56:21] <introspectr5> :p
[15:56:28] <introspectr5> then it can be quite painful
[15:57:07] <axe9|work> I.. actually work a lot in asp.net
[15:57:18] <axe9|work> http://pastebin.com/iMDyKrqr
[15:57:21] <introspectr5> lol i was joking, mostly
[15:57:37] <axe9|work> I put a note at the bottom with that I think they should both return
[15:57:56] <introspectr5> can you paste in the receiving function?
[15:58:23] <axe9|work> Not. sure..
[15:58:32] <introspectr5> if th ereceiver was unable to parse your ajax call's input, then it would unlikely return <xml>
[15:59:00] <Erendrake> robert: am I just barking up the wrong tree? I can try something else if need be
[15:59:04] <axe9|work> The webservice is in a table and I give it some names, and then element names, and then some SQL and it pases the param in.
[15:59:20] <axe9|work> I honestly don't know how it all works.
[16:00:12] <Erendrake> axe, i think you might have put your success code in your alert section
[16:00:23] <Erendrake> hmmmm
[16:00:25] <Erendrake> actually
[16:00:32] <axe9|work> It's async so should that matter?
[16:00:44] <Erendrake> your success just as an error
[16:00:57] <Erendrake> your alert is not terminated
[16:01:02] <axe9|work> One of the devs said the same thing, but the other ones work fine stuff :s
[16:01:02] <Erendrake> so it would just stop
[16:01:46] <Erendrake> if you just remove the alert from the start of the second request
[16:02:03] <Erendrake> i meant the start of the success
[16:02:28] <axe9|work> Oh jesus
[16:02:49] <axe9|work> How'd that get there T_T
[16:03:50] <axe9|work> Well still no dice...
[16:05:45] <Erendrake> can you tell if you are getting an error?
[16:06:01] <Erendrake> do you have some kind of developer console open to watch for it?
[16:06:21] <Erendrake> the developer tools are your friend :)
[16:07:13] <axe9|work> Erendrake: Yeah... You're going to shun me if I tell you which one though.
[16:07:39] <axe9|work> I was trying to use firebug but kept getting confused, so I was using the IE12 one
[16:09:40] <Erendrake> all good, most of us have to support some version of IE
[16:10:15] <Erendrake> and their dev tools are better than nothing
[16:11:25] <robertmaxrees> We go back to 8 here
[16:11:33] <Erendrake> us too
[16:11:41] <robertmaxrees> it's generally not too bad.
[16:11:54] <axe9|work> I found the IE12 ones way easier to monitor the network traffic and to see the response headers.
[16:12:01] <robertmaxrees> IE12???
[16:12:05] <axe9|work> But it's the one I learned on so *shrug*
[16:12:25] <axe9|work> sorry 11
[16:12:29] <axe9|work> I donno why I kept saying 12
[16:12:56] <robertmaxrees> it's all good - they released 12 onto the dev channel iirc.
[16:12:58] <robertmaxrees> working on it.
[16:16:57] <JensB> Hi take a look at: http://castlemountain.dk/MIRC/mirc.php    i need to set the dialog ui at an absolte position, how do I do that?
[16:18:36] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean?  because it currently has position: absolute on it.
[16:20:18] <JensB> sorry - i mean how do I set the position to say 100 px from top, 100 px from left side of screen?
[16:23:21] <robertmaxrees> there's a position option: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[16:25:00] <axe9|work> \o/ I got it 'working'
[16:25:06] <robertmaxrees> figure it out?
[16:25:34] <axe9|work> Yeah, I'm an idiot and had the SQL call misnamed so it never actually hit the right SP
[16:25:40] <robertmaxrees> nah, not stupid.
[16:25:43] <axe9|work> and I also fixed a pretty glaring logic error lol
[16:25:44] <JensB> thanks man!
[16:25:44] <jumanji> hi guys how do I bind a click handler on an element that is hidden and I don't know ahead of time what the selector is
[16:25:44] <robertmaxrees> just adventurous.
[16:26:07] <robertmaxrees> jumanji errr, you don't.  you have to know a selector for it.
[16:26:08] <jumanji> $(document).on('click', '*', function (e) {     e.stopPropagation();alert('clicked'); }); doesn't fire if an element is hidden and appears again in the future
[16:26:18] <robertmaxrees> define "hidden"
[16:26:34] <axe9|work> robertmaxrees: I clocked 73 hours last week due to some system issues, and I keep warning that making people code with no sleep causes shit like this lol
[16:26:44] <jumanji> ValicekB: display: none;
[16:26:49] <axe9|work> How would one click a hidden element
[16:26:58] <jumanji> when it becomes visible
[16:26:58] <robertmaxrees> jumanji that shouldn't cause any problems with that.
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> jumanji you need a class or something.  your issue is your stopPropagation() call.
[16:27:39] <jumanji> pretty sure that's not it
[16:27:53] <jumanji> as I get no alert when i click on a nelement that reappears
[16:28:04] <jumanji> here's an example maybe it will clarify things
[16:28:18] <jumanji> i'll show you waht I mean if you run the code  $(document).on('click', '*', function (e) {     e.stopPropagation();alert('clicked'); });  in the console at http://vancouver.craigslist.ca/van/acc/4596998046.html and you click on 'reply', notice you can't click on anywhere in the box that appears
[16:28:35] <jumanji> everywhere else, it will show alret
[16:32:21] <robertmaxrees> sounds like they might be preventing those actions then
[16:32:35] <robertmaxrees> but showing/hiding shouldn't break that.
[16:43:29] <jumanji> robertmaxrees: I think you are right
[16:43:37] <jumanji> robertmaxrees: when I tried mousedown, it works
[16:43:48] <jumanji> robertmaxrees: click just does not seem to fire on this page
[16:43:52] <jumanji> i wonder how they are doing this
[16:44:35] <jumanji> could I use mousedown instead of 'click' ?
[16:53:04] <robertmaxrees> jumanji it depends on what you're looking for :)
[16:53:12] <robertmaxrees> mousedown should work just fine.
[16:53:18] <jumanji> robertmaxrees: yeah with mouse down it works
[17:14:09] <axe9|work> hey thanks everyone. I got it all working \o/
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> glad to hear!
[18:10:44] <stoned> hi
[18:10:52] <stoned> what's the best channel for jquery plugin
[18:11:23] <stoned> I am trying to find out which plugin is good/recommended by developers for client side form validation using ajax
[18:12:35] <grizly> http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[18:13:10] <stoned> http://formvalidator.net/
[18:13:12] <stoned> I found this
[18:13:14] <stoned> oh
[18:14:07] <stoned> hnm
[18:14:16] <stoned> the first one seems a bit confusing
[18:14:25] <stoned> also the download package, there is no cdn
[18:14:28] <grizly> yeah, yours looks very simple :-) Cheers for sharing
[18:14:29] <stoned> 2nd has one cdn
[18:14:36] <stoned> sure man
[18:14:39] <stoned> you are most welcome
[18:14:40] <stoned> :)
[18:22:01] <fuuuuuud> onClick="this.form.submit()"  should this work in <input> form even if i don't have javascript tag
[18:22:42] <grizly> what would the "this" be in that context?
[18:22:55] <fuuuuuud> checkbox input
[18:23:06] <fuuuuuud> <input type="checkbox...
[18:26:11] <grizly> I'm not sure you can use "this" as an identifier for something and not break things.. but I could be wrong
[18:26:12] <grizly> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[18:30:14] <rahuldroy_work> hey guys, has anyone here used pace before?
[18:32:14] <grizly> no, but it looks cool
[18:39:24] <rahuldroy_work> yeah, it is super easy to estup but I want to use the same thing an a search area where ajax is used
[18:52:57] <manaman> anyway how to avoid SlideDown from adding overflow:hidden to the element?
[18:53:14] <ewilazarus> Hello everybody... I'm struggling to get jquery's plugin called 'jquery.inputmask' by Robin Herbots to work. I can create a mask with it but I want to use the property autoUnmask set to true so I get "clean" data on the serverside. Could someone please give me a hint?
[18:54:27] <Vivekananda_y510> anyone here
[18:56:32] <grizly> Vivekananda_y510: busy working awa.. but yes, here
[18:59:11] <dbizzy> here
[18:59:38] <dbizzy> it's me is it you?
[18:59:38] <dbizzy> I'm here are you there?
[18:59:41] <Vivekananda_y510> I am stuck with something stupid and trying to figure out and making very slow progress. I have a running webpage and have hacked it down but cannot figure out why the graph in the page does not go all the way to the right. Here is the visible site :  http://6526ec6c.ngrok.com/safeview/dashboard2/ajaxversion/index3.html   . can someone tell me what occupies the left side space ?
[19:00:32] <Vivekananda_y510> dbizzy, I guess you meant your handle to be  b dizzy :)
[19:00:43] <Vivekananda_y510> bdizzy :)
[19:01:04] <dbizzy> =p
[19:01:43] <dbizzy> what graphic are you trying to move?
[19:02:31] <grizly> bootstrap is adding 13px of padding-right
[19:02:36] <manaman> anyway how to avoid SlideDown from adding overflow:hidden to the element?
[19:05:00] <dbizzy> take a look at .chart-large, .chart-small, .chart-xl overflow is set to hidden as manaman pointed out
[19:05:56] <manaman> :S
[19:06:05] <gnarf> manaman: kind of
[19:06:25] <manaman> cool how?
[19:06:29] <gnarf> manaman: sadly in order to pull off animated width/height overflow kind of needs to be hidden
[19:06:52] <gnarf> what version of jQuery?
[19:06:53] <manaman> Ah worst case
[19:07:19] <manaman> 1.7.2
[19:07:57] <manaman> So nothing at all to be done? Problem im using position: absolute on a div and it gets hidden
[19:08:28] <gnarf> hrm
[19:08:34] <gnarf> sorry, 1.7 doesn't have my prefilters
[19:08:39] <gnarf> kinda hard to hack in there
[19:08:43] <gnarf> in 1.8+ you can do
[19:09:33] <manaman> I can upgrade, not sure why it's lower
[19:09:38] <gnarf> jQuery.Animation.prefilter(function( elem, props, opts ) { if ("height" in props || "width" in props) { elem.style.overflow = ''; });
[19:09:41] <gnarf> or like
[19:09:47] <gnarf> check "elem" to see if it is what you want
[19:10:09] <gnarf> basically, it will still set overflow hidden
[19:10:12] <gnarf> but you can unset it
[19:10:18] <gnarf> before it even gets to a render loop
[19:10:56] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L160
[19:11:07] <gnarf> this is where it sets overflow:hidden
[19:11:27] <manaman> ah cool thanks gnarf I'll try it
[19:11:39] <manaman> so does something nasty happen when it doesnt set that overflow?
[19:12:17] <gnarf> manaman: overflow: hidden lets the box shrink around its contents without them falling out of the box
[19:12:49] <manaman> gnarf: oh makes sense, darn
[19:13:13] <manaman> maybe an css fix
[19:13:53] <gnarf> elem.style wins
[19:15:06] <gnarf> manaman: it should restore the original overflow properties after the animation ends though
[19:15:28] <manaman> yeah inspector said it didn't
[19:15:31] <gnarf> manaman
[19:15:41] <gnarf> also i think as of like version 1.9 maybe
[19:16:05] <manaman> gnarf: aight thanks I'm gonna try upgrading
[19:16:25] <gnarf> you can pass  start: function() { $(this).css('overflow', ''); }  in the options
[19:17:14] <gnarf> o hey
[19:17:15] <gnarf> 1.8
[19:17:19] <gnarf> i guess i added it then too
[19:17:24] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[19:17:47] <gnarf> manaman: http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[19:18:31] <manaman> Trying
[19:18:54] <gnarf> .slideDown({ duration: 250, start: function() { $(this).css('overflow', ''); }, done: function() {} })
[19:21:31] <manaman> gnarf: hah perfect with the slidedown function content thanks
[19:23:35] <gnarf> i totally forgot i added "start" :)
[21:29:52] <Babalau> hellp everyone

[21:30:33] <Babalau> why isn't the FOO menu updating ?

[21:39:40] <morfin> hello
[21:39:59] <morfin> how can i avoid throwing error 200 in jQuery?
[21:41:16] <Uhkis> error 200?
[21:42:24] <systemfault> morfin: The question doesn’t make sense… 200 is “OK”
[21:43:25] <systemfault> Babalau: How can the JS parser find how the string you’re passing to .filter ends?
[21:45:07] <Babalau> systemfault, yeah, i was missing something there :)
[21:45:19] <morfin> jQuery throws 200 so i catch it in .catch(error){...} block
[21:46:01] <morfin> i resolve my promise in .done handler and .reject in .fail handler
[21:46:33] <systemfault> o_O
[21:46:49] <systemfault> 200 is alright… it’s not a failure.
[21:46:58] <systemfault> Can you post an example on jsfiddle?
