[08:41:02] <MassDebates> Oi
[08:41:06] <MassDebates> jquery folks
[08:41:20] <MassDebates> Someone asked a question in ##javascript and I tried helping them but I can't get it to work, either!
[08:41:24] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/znq8me9r/
[08:41:29] <MassDebates> is this a scoping issue?
[09:49:46] <Cork> MassDebates: what is it that doesn't work?
[09:50:03] <MassDebates> Figured out the issue but not the solution
[09:50:07] <MassDebates> the guy who asked said he'll try something else
[09:50:14] <MassDebates> if I have free time today I'll experiment so I can learn, myself.
[09:50:31] <MassDebates> there's nothing rendering the table after the value has changed
[09:50:37] <MassDebates> Thank you Cork
[09:50:43] <MassDebates> there's a bunch of issues with it but yeah
[09:50:47] <MassDebates> that's the boiled down version
[09:50:49] <Cork> MassDebates: you mean from the click handler?
[09:50:53] <MassDebates> yes
[09:51:06] <MassDebates> Probably can just throw the jsgrid stuff inside the click handler to trigger the new loadup and render
[09:51:06] <Cork> ya, setting a global value in a click handler won't change anything
[09:51:10] <MassDebates> yeah
[09:51:26] <Cork> i think you need to update the grid not render it again
[09:51:44] <Cork> also picklist isn't used anywhere
[09:51:45] <MassDebates> please don't spend time fixing it!
[09:51:50] <Cork> i won't
[09:51:53] <MassDebates> Thank you :)
[09:52:06] <Cork> so nothing changes cause nothing relevant is changing
[09:52:08] <MassDebates> yes I noticed picklist after I write in here
[09:52:57] <Cork> (also i'm helping you not the original questionee, better prepared for the next time something similar happens)
[09:55:30] <MassDebates> He gave up on it but I'll be using this to experiment and learn later.
[09:55:35] <MassDebates> Thank you again
