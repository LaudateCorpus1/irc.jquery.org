[01:26:41] <WhirledPress> so the bubbling up thing. does capturing the click event on a div that contains anchor elements prohibit you from catching the event on the anchor elements as well?
[02:37:09] <neo_> hi

[05:22:11] <Kartagis> ahoy
[05:22:11] <Kartagis> why is https://jsfiddle.net/pqhy71qh/ allow ONE alphanumeric as well as numeric?
[05:22:11] <Kartagis> does*
[05:24:04] <localh0st> Kartagis: ?
[05:24:17] <Kartagis> yes?
[05:25:25] <localh0st> Kartagis: what are you asking for?
[05:26:46] <Kartagis>  why does https://jsfiddle.net/pqhy71qh/ allow ONE alphanumeric as well as numeric? it shouldn't allow alphanumerics at all
[05:30:54] <Uhkis> Kartagis: you want keyup
[05:31:54] <Kartagis> Uhkis: okay, but why does keydown do that?
[05:32:10] <Kartagis> keypress*
[09:33:31] <neo_> good evening guys!
[09:33:56] <neo_> I have little problem
[09:35:34] <neo_> How make in clean js beforesend function ?
[09:36:05] <neo_> I added timer and it's add animation, without timer its doesn't work
[09:36:23] <neo_> or leave it like is ?
[09:36:29] <neo_> work and good ???
[09:36:56] <neo_> there something strange happans
[09:38:29] <Woet> neo_: share your test case via www.jsfiddle.net
[09:40:02] <neo_> I tired to do it use codepen.io , can codepen.io send ajax request ?
[09:59:39] <KnightsOfNi> Hello, I have this code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c2203a2d9c4c3bb6526f1ae3f7bd4d2c - but each time I submit the form, it submits twice. Anyone know why?
[10:11:45] <neo_> who know codepen.io supported Ajax ?
[10:48:16] <neo_> ok guys , codepen sooner can't send Ajax requests , I even couldn't find there
[10:48:49] <neo_> there in documentation not see about Ajax, sooner that not supported :(
[10:49:15] <neo_> will think oneself make research and use google , it's will faster
[10:49:53] <neo_> just interesting why I can't call functions before call xmlHttpRequests
[10:50:13] <neo_> when I do call my function and return it's work good
[10:50:41] <neo_> and when without return going xmlHttpRequest my function doesn't work
[10:51:00] <taplar> what's the issue?
[10:51:10] <neo_> when I add call xmlHttRequest inside setTimeOut it work
[10:51:18] <neo_> show code now
[10:52:54] <neo_> https://hastebin.com/asujewufug.js
[10:52:58] <neo_> 24 row
[10:53:22] <neo_> this code must instantly execute , and it's wait end ajax request
[10:53:26] <taplar> you need to ask in ##javascript then.  this is not jQuery code
[10:53:41] <neo_> don't have access there
[10:53:52] <taplar> doesn't change the topic of this room mate
[10:54:01] <neo_> jQuery folks also know clean javascript
[10:54:23] <taplar> so do ##javascript and their room is dedicated to answering those questions
[10:54:28] <taplar> this room is focused on jquery questions
[10:55:11] <neo_> I got this there http://prntscr.com/g0k9rm
[10:55:36] <taplar> are you registered and authed?
[10:55:49] <taplar> doesn't look like it
[10:56:01] <neo_> no
[10:56:18] <taplar> go to #freenode and ask about registering and authing
[10:57:06] <taplar> or go to that HOWTO link in that screenshot
[10:57:55] <neo_> there not how to
[10:58:13] <taplar> that pic clearly has a HOWTO link
[10:58:17] <neo_> https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration
[10:58:23] <neo_> this guide
[10:58:31] <taplar> that's not what's in that picture
[10:58:42] <taplar> in any case, if you don't find that, hit up #freenode
[11:00:01] <shoky> /msg nickserv help register
[11:00:44] <neo_> https://gist.github.com/brigand/f271177642368307f051
[11:08:09] <neo_> can't go there
[11:10:16] <neo_> I decided don't think much, added timer and all
[11:31:06] <neo_> guys do you think this is normally do programm and don't know how it works ?
[11:31:21] <taplar> what?
[11:31:59] <neo_> I made code work but I think it must work without timer . I dont understand why it doesnt work without timer . must work without timer
[11:32:17] <neo_> I feel anxiety and blame ...
[11:32:45] <taplar> So research the issue.  Google, Stackoverflow, ##javascript.  plenty of resources available
[11:34:58] <taplar> No one is born knowing everything.  Nothing to feel bad about
[11:44:05] <neo_> all day spent solving this issue , maybe lack knowledge
[11:46:37] <neo_> need read some textbooks about javascript or jQuery ....
[11:47:55] <neo_> I now want read this book http://prntscr.com/g0kzwa
[11:48:53] <neo_> or choose this ? http://prntscr.com/g0l0h3
[11:49:29] <neo_> taplar, which book you have read about javascript or jQuery ? Want all read about wordpress javascript and jQuery
[11:50:43] <neo_> or this ? http://prntscr.com/g0l1da
[11:51:06] <taplar> i've mostly just learned from web examples and apis, and watching other talk about their issues
[11:51:27] <neo_> I also doing the same
[11:51:43] <neo_> use video lessons
[11:52:14] <taplar> personally, the best thing to do to learn is just to try things
[11:52:26] <catbadger> taplar for the win
[11:52:33] <Uhkis> strongly agree with taplar there
[11:53:13] <neo_> yes , but maybe now time when need read at least one book ....
[11:53:25] <catbadger> tahat being said, university will teach you a ton and give you many opportunities to discuss ideas with people also learning the same thing...
[11:53:37] <neo_> I need this to improve English and vocabulary
[11:54:02] <catbadger> neo_ what's your native language?
[11:54:11] <neo_> Uhkis, why ? you have ever read textbook about some programming language ?
[11:54:18] <neo_> catbadger, russian
[11:54:22] * catbadger is university educated.
[11:54:24] <Uhkis> neo_: no and very probably never will
[11:54:46] <catbadger> Uhkis what's your job role?
[11:55:16] * catbadger is a senior full-stack developer. I would be an engineer,but in Canada you need an actual engineering degree for that title...
[11:55:38] <Uhkis> i guess that full-stack dev is close enough
[11:55:47] <neo_> Uhkiss, who read books they can more beautiful speak and have more active vocabulary , you need this to be better
[11:56:05] <taplar> ehhhhh
[11:56:15] <catbadger> neo_ yes, but you don't need it to be a developer. just to be a better developer ;)
[11:56:16] <Uhkis> neo_: well that's just not true :D
[11:56:25] <taplar> being logical doesn't mean you are sociable
[11:56:39] <taplar> doesn't mean you are not, either.  just not a correlation
[11:56:44] <catbadger> yes
[11:57:01] <catbadger> I agree that reading can aid in vocabulary and understanding of deeper concepts.
[11:57:41] <catbadger> but the internet will provide all you need to become a developer if you apply the concepts you learn in something practical to wow non-technical hiring managers who have never coded.
[11:57:49] <Uhkis> just don't let taplar's "your" and "you're" sink in and you're golden :D
[11:57:56] <taplar> lmao
[11:58:03] <taplar> i never learn
[11:58:05] <catbadger> but if your manager is university educated, you need a degree
[11:58:29] <neo_> Uhkis, no for native language this rule apply to be more orator , you can speak better than counterpart which don't read, but you can much speak and also up
[11:59:05] * catbadger has to actually do some work
[12:00:02] <neo_> taplar, it's not depend on being logical or not , it depend our your brain , children in school who retarded always teachers say read more and they started overtake his mates
[12:00:04] <Uhkis> neo_: for english, just take a class
[12:00:35] <neo_> Uhkis, yes , but soon this rule will apply to english also ?
[12:00:45] <taplar> being logical is very important
[12:00:49] <taplar> you are programming.  it is entirely logic based
[12:00:55] <neo_> Uhkis , or only for native language ?
[12:02:56] <neo_> taplar, being
[12:02:56] <neo_> Eloquent also , you can make on folks good impression . And on girls , on girls especially they live with their ears :)
[12:03:18] <taplar> huh?
[12:03:30] <Uhkis> neo_: you lost me
[12:03:55] <neo_> Uhkis, about take class ?
[12:04:06] <neo_> understood
[12:05:00] <neo_> passed this ))) , its only one opinion
[12:06:17] <neo_> they love*
[12:06:39] <Uhkis> neo_: i meant that if you wanna improve your english, you should take a class instead of trying to learn from books
[12:07:54] <neo_> Uhkis, yes, it's can't help , without Eng - environment it will give not big effect . Forgot all rapidly
[12:08:48] <neo_> Uhkis, I tired watch TV , it's like diving in English environment , there they so fast speak ...
[12:10:16] <neo_> Uhkis, soon arrived from China devise for search sittelite and I found satelite where many english channels , will watch not only BBC world
[12:11:41] <taplar> There are most likely some youtube videos about learning different languages you might look into.
[12:14:02] <neo_> maybe this my limit and I can't advance forward yet .
[12:14:42] <sla3k> Hi, can anyone please have a look at the code at https://pastebin.com/R2x0bK9f and tell me what am I doing wrong?
[12:14:45] <neo_> one guy say me you can archived your limit and English won't improve
[12:19:03] <taplar> sla3k: what's the issue?
[12:23:19] <taplar> fixing to go get some food, but you have an ajax call in a document ready, and logic outside the document ready that is trying to use a variable that is being set from the ajax call.  probably an issue there
[12:26:03] <sla3k> taplar: value.txt has a number that is updated frequently (10 seconds or so), I want that number to be updated a couple of seconds (fetch from the server where ajax comes in) and feed it to the animate gauge so that it can show on the webpage, in a...well, gauge like chart
[12:26:42] <catbadger> sla3k why not use a callback or event when you update?
[12:29:54] <Darren_> https://pastebin.com/J0hTSV3E how can I get this to look at each instance of .mbgc-gallery vs all at once? I could have 3 galleries on a page and would like the code to look at each one separately, if that makes sense
[12:35:39] <sla3k> catbadger: I am very new to all this, not sure what you mean. If by chance you mean reload the page, then I cannot do that because when I reload the whole page, the gauge needle comes down to 0 and then to the new number
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning #jquery
[12:40:24] <catbadger> sla3k that is not what i mean.
[12:40:47] <catbadger> why do you think using a callback has anything to do with reloading the page?
[12:42:33] <sla3k> I don't know, nothing else comes to my mind? I've been playing with this for the past two day and yet has to get a result, lol I am thinking random things now
[12:47:56] <catbadger> sla3k, where do you work?
[12:49:05] <catbadger> srry off topic.
[12:51:11] <catbadger> sla3k: Google stuff. I'd recommend searching for "javascript primer variables, arrays, functions, events and callbacks"
[12:51:30] <catbadger> thinking random stuff is a terrible way to write code...
[12:51:34] <catbadger> :)
[12:52:40] <catbadger> i'm sorry if that sounds  condescending...
[12:53:35] * catbadger drops mic.
[12:53:42] * catbadger drops pin...
[12:53:52] * AwkwardCough 
[12:54:02] <taplar_lunch> traitor
[12:54:22] <AwkwardCough> eh its a living
[12:54:23] <sla3k> catbadger: That's fine and thanks for the pointers, surely go through a google search for those. cheers
[12:57:03] <catbadger> sla3k :)
[14:17:26] <scalper> hey
[14:17:29] <scalper> i have a simple alert function that asks for a password that is in a variable..but once the correct password is entered i want it to store it in a cookie so if the page is reloaded the cookie has the password so it won't be asked again, can someone help me with this simple thing? https://pastebin.com/ANx06Haw
[15:01:52] <taplar> you don't want to do that
[15:02:16] <taplar> for anything that required any sort of security, you do not want to have the password validation on the front end
[15:04:00] <taplar> you can use sessionStorage/localStorage to store a value, but this use case is flawed with the details I previously mentioned.
[15:08:52] <scetian> Hi guys. Need some help here. I am using this (https://github.com/hilliuse/ruler) to show ruler on page but I want it to work only on a div instead of body. Can anyone please guide me in the right direction?
[15:28:36] <taplar> have you tried using it on a div?
[15:38:31] <Srgjames> Im getting the value of a checkbox with var checkbox = event.currentTarget.dataset.value and now i want to use the var checkbox $(tr.checkbox).hide(); but this is not working how can i get this to work ?)
[15:39:06] <GeekMonkey> I have a menu and need to highlight the parent element when I hover the child
[15:39:12] <Srgjames> the tr has the class of the checkbox so if var = Image theres a tr class Image
[15:40:40] <taplar> 'tr.'+checkbox
[15:43:35] <Srgjames> taplar TY its working
[15:44:14] <taplar> GeekMonkey: need more info about the parent and child
[15:44:32] <taplar> but essentially it's $(theChildElement).closest(parentSelector).dostuff...
[15:54:54] <EriC^^> i'm using $('#id).append(<span>) and it works, i need to replace the text so i tried with .text(<span>) but i get <span> in the website instead of it being rendered, any ideas?
[15:55:15] <robertmaxrees> .append('<span>foo</span>')
[15:56:35] <EriC^^> i need to remove the text that's already in the #id
[15:57:23] <EriC^^> i'll try putting .empty() before it
[15:57:56] <taplar> use html()
[15:58:09] <taplar> text() make whatever you give it a text Node
[15:58:43] <EriC^^> oh ok
[16:00:56] <EriC^^> it works, thanks
[16:03:22] <robertmaxrees> ah.  that's what you needed.
[16:03:23] <robertmaxrees> derp
[19:13:43] <Stragler> Hello. I have this code: https://dpaste.de/CJfD After completing an AJAX call I insert the fetched info into the DOM. Then, I want to access those elements but since they are new too the DOM they are not being accessed by jquery. I believe I would be able to access it either through .find or .children or something from my .main_container class, but I don’t know how exactly. Anyone have any suggestions?
[19:14:42] <taplar> use a delegate binding instead
[19:15:16] <taplar> $('.main_container').on('click', '.order', function .... );
[19:15:31] <robertmaxrees> ^ jquery can find the data, you're just finding it at the wrong time :)
[19:19:00] <Stragler> taplar, robertmaxrees Thanks!!
[20:26:43] <rapha> hi!
[20:28:19] <rapha> I have a <main> to which I keep .append()ing <article>s, but the <main>.height() stays the same, and console.log($('article:last-child')) always returns the first <article>. What am I doing wrong?
[20:28:57] <rapha> (Code at https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/37519b3e3d377a56a131d319cc5e6a87)
[20:57:14] <Stragler> I have a form, but my input elements are nested inside divs. When I select my form with $(‘#myForm’) and .serialize() it, I don’t get any values. Why is this and what would be a solution for this?
[21:03:16] <Stragler> https://dpaste.de/c7jc This does not work. Is it because my inputs are inside divs?
[22:19:23] <sqram> is there a way to select parent inside an expression?
[22:19:37] <sqram> like $('input ^parent')
[22:41:29] <lemonsparrow> is there a library to create tree with nodes having text data in it and then saving it as json/xml format ?
