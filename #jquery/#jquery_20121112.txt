[00:02:50] <johnnyhooks> http://superreal.de/
[00:02:53] <johnnyhooks> is that a custom slider?
[00:03:11] <johnnyhooks> i pulled the code but it doesnt point to anything specific
[00:03:20] <johnnyhooks> i was just wondering if it was a tweaked bootstrap carousel
[00:09:55] <aqeel> hi room
[00:10:01] <Hooloovoo> hi aqeel

[00:16:12] <johnnyhooks> damn whoever built that site is a boss
[00:16:21] <johnnyhooks> custom ground up - no CMS either

[00:18:45] <grafi> :o
[00:30:45] <shankey> is there any way to select folder instead of file?
[00:33:12] <Cork> shankey: you mean from an ajax call?
[00:33:16] <Cork> or what?
[00:34:09] <shankey> Cork: thanks for the reply, in input box type= file is used to select file but my requirement is to select folder
[00:34:23] <Cork> ah, so file upload?
[00:34:36] <Cork> as far as i know no browser provide support for picking folders
[00:35:10] <Cork> you might be able to do it through a plugin like flash/java/silverlight/google gears
[00:36:02] <Cork> shankey: you could do something like it through d&d though
[00:36:20] <Cork> not sure if it can handle folders dropped though
[00:36:27] <Cork> but it might make file selection easier
[00:37:14] <shankey> Cork: true but my requirement is to select folder so that i can get that folder path in the input box
[00:37:34] <Cork> first answer then, as far as i know; not possible
[00:37:52] <shankey> Cork: :(
[00:38:03] <shankey> Cork: thanks
[00:38:24] <Cork> browsers are VERY restrictive when its giving a website access to local files
[00:42:16] <shankey> Cork: true
[00:47:37] <kborchers> shankey: check out http://caniuse.com/#feat=filereader and http://bgrins.github.com/filereader.js/ but will only work if you don't need ie support except ie10
[00:48:29] <Cork> kborchers: that still won't give you folder access
[00:48:46] <Cork> the file api is just so js can access the file data
[00:49:21] <kborchers> Cork: correct â€¦ sorry didn't read carefully. that will not list file contents
[00:49:27] <kborchers> folder*
[00:51:20] <Bauer> Cork: any idea how to disable form submit from input text field using the "enter" key? I disabled the submit button, but apparently on chrome and IE, enter still submits
[00:51:39] <shankey> kborchers: its for file i need to get folder path
[00:51:45] <Cork> Bauer: submit on the form
[00:51:53] <Cork> Bauer: you should never do anything on the submit button
[00:52:02] <Cork> except if you want something visually
[00:52:27] <Bauer> Cork: what do you mean submit on the form? disable the form submit? how?
[00:52:52] <Cork> $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[00:53:32] <Cork> or possibly better $('form').on('submit.block-submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[00:53:48] <Cork> and then $('form').off('.block-submit');
[00:54:21] <Cork> that only works if you don't use a submit listener already
[00:54:29] <Cork> if you do set a .data value and check that in the event handler
[00:56:03] <Bauer> Cork: thanks, and how would I re-enable submission once I am ready to?
[00:56:24] * Cork points up
[00:57:15] <Bauer> which? the $('form').on( thing like that disables submission
[00:57:29] <Cork> the next line
[00:57:58] <Bauer> ahhh the .off lifts the disabled status? I thought its another disabling way
[00:58:25] <Cork> it removes all bound events with the namespace 'blocked-submit'
[00:59:07] <Bauer> thanks Cork :) how do I verify the system does not use even listeners already? I actually suspect it does
[00:59:31] <Cork> Bauer: test it
[00:59:39] <Cork> Bauer: there isn't really a good way to test that
[00:59:48] <Cork> uh i mean to check it
[00:59:52] <Cork> -_-'
[01:00:00] <rethus> why this didn't work http://jsfiddle.net/vsWbd/9/
[01:00:11] <Cork> only way is to check if hte submition happens even with the event active
[01:00:36] <Cork> ?.prop @ rethus
[01:00:36] <bot-t> rethus, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[01:00:53] <Cork> rethus: and the url has to match exactly
[01:00:57] <Cork> it doens't
[01:01:08] <Cork> *doesn't
[01:01:22] <Bauer> wroks perfectly Cork, thanks!!! :)
[01:02:17] <rethus> Cork: thanks
[01:17:11] <NodeX> ?on
[01:17:11] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:23:30] <dJquery> know this is off topic but has anyone found a service that will list all the street names for a zip code
[01:24:11] <astropirate> hmmm
[01:24:20] <astropirate> i think y ou might be able to get it out of openmaps
[01:24:23] <astropirate> or whatever they go by
[01:27:38] <Trisox> how do you guys detect ie 10?
[01:28:09] <dJquery> ?useragent
[01:28:11] <bot-t> dJquery, jQuery.browser - We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser will be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. Contains flags fo... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[01:30:10] <Trisox> dJquery:  thats way ;)
[01:36:43] <faraway> Trisox: why do you need to detect it ?
[01:39:06] <Trisox> cause it gives me some bugs
[01:41:06] <faraway> Trisox: IE 10 does not support conditional comments in html anymore but still in JScript that way you could detect it .. but that is also not recommend ... recommend way would be that you detect the error browser has that error and then load a fix
[01:41:18] <Trisox> i know
[01:43:55] <faraway> Trisox: aren't you able to detect those bugs ?
[01:48:04] <Trisox> its layout.. stuff i used modrnizer
[01:48:18] <Trisox> they wanned the cheapest solution...
[01:48:40] <Trisox> so .. i detected ie10 and set class on the html .ie9 ....
[01:48:48] <Trisox> now layout works again
[01:48:55] <Trisox> ill comeback later to realy fix it
[01:49:14] <Trisox> for now its good enought
[01:49:15] <Trisox> -t
[01:53:14] <cuddle> hello, I was looking through the source code of query-ui, and somewhere in one of the widgets it assigns something to fx.now, does anyone know what this is used for?
[02:00:01] <Cork> cuddle: what version?
[02:00:12] <cuddle> 1.91
[02:01:37] <Cork> looks like animation tick adjustments
[02:01:41] <nobitanobi_> hi
[02:01:43] <faraway> cuddle: now it a property of Tween that is passed to the step function of an animation
[02:01:50] <Cork> fx.now = Math.round( total - toHide.outerHeight() - adjust );
[02:02:05] <cuddle> so it's not a property of fx?
[02:02:29] <Cork> its a variable on fx yes
[02:03:02] <cuddle> in the documentation, it says jquery.now is the result of getTime()
[02:03:08] <cuddle> is fx.now the same?
[02:03:14] <cuddle> sorry, don't really understand :)
[02:03:38] <faraway> cuddle:    you mean the fx in the accordion ?
[02:03:44] <cuddle> yes
[02:04:05] <Cork> cuddle: no its not the same
[02:04:08] <faraway> cuddle: fx is passed a param and is a Tween object of jquery
[02:04:38] <nobitanobi_> How woudl I catch the value returning from the $.each in order to usit in the submit function? http://jsfiddle.net/ubuPb/
[02:04:59] <Cork> cuddle: fx.now is just used to adjust the animation to keep it in sync
[02:05:08] <Cork> cuddle: $.now is a function
[02:05:09] <cuddle> is now the current step?
[02:05:28] <Cork> yes
[02:05:31] <cuddle> ash ok thanks :)
[02:05:38] <cuddle> I got confused with the function
[02:05:46] <Cork> its a rounded value of now
[02:06:23] <Cork> $.now = function() { return ( new Date() ).getTime(); }
[02:06:44] <faraway> nobitanobi_: http://jsfiddle.net/ubuPb/1/
[02:07:24] <nobitanobi_> I thought the scope of is_valid was different inside the function of each
[02:07:48] <Cork> nobitanobi_: it is, but he defines it in the parent scope
[02:07:51] <qoieue> hi all, can anyone tell me the dierence between jquery's .outerWidth() and the native DOM's offsetWidth?
[02:07:57] <Cork> so it inherits
[02:07:58] <nobitanobi_> Cork: ok. Thanks man
[02:20:03] <anli> hello
[02:20:19] <anli> Is there a way to see if there is a .click(function(){}); handler added to an element in firebug?
[02:20:33] <anli> And which code that will run on the event
[02:21:23] <faraway> anli: there was a firequery plugin, but i don't know it this still works/exists
[02:21:31] <anli> ok
[02:21:47] <anli> Seems like chrome has some abilities, must check
[02:24:52] <Cork> anli: $._data(elm, 'events')
[02:28:58] <karstenk1977_> hello, someone here works with mCustomScrollbar?
[02:30:33] <Trisox> firequery still works
[02:33:01] <faraway> Trisox: for chrome there is https://developer.chrome.com/trunk/extensions/samples.html#924f75a201bb0ec8d6c0b1c9c88c679ea211c93d. which adds a new pannel to the side bar with "jQuery Properties"
[02:37:05] <shashi> hi i wants to know the height of the option tag in select box, But when i am using .height(), .outerHeight() method it is always returning 0 to me. Can any one help me about this , Thanks
[02:37:35] <Cork> shashi: you could try setting display: inline-block; on them
[02:37:44] <Cork> not sure if that will work, but its the only option
[02:38:07] <Cork> shashi: options doens't have a height by default (as its an inline element)
[02:38:14] <Christer> Does anyone know about a good Media script/plugin/module for Viewing/Selecting files like the one in Wordpress/Joomla ?
[02:38:36] <shashi> ok thanks cork
[02:41:52] <thember> I want to create a generic mouse handler in on of my classes, but having problems with getting a reference to the main object, please see http://pastebin.com/ahpVMuUe
[02:42:18] <ItsJustMe> How do I filter for the html5 data-attributes? Doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/c3Xu4q6S
[02:43:00] <Cork> thember: this points to the object it's attached to
[02:43:53] <Cork> thember: only way to do it in another way is to store a reference to the object and call the function on it, or use .call/.apply on the function (with the variable you want as this as the fist object)
[02:43:53] <thember> Cork: but I always want to get a reference to the main object, regardless of which object it's attached to. How can I achieve this?
[02:44:06] <Cork> you can't, not directly
[02:44:06] <Trisox> nice faraway
[02:44:16] <Cork> you have to create a proxy function
[02:44:21] <Cork> jquery can help you there
[02:44:24] <Cork> ?.proxy
[02:44:25] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[02:45:18] <thember> Cork: are there any other methods? which is independent from the 3rd libraries?
[02:45:25] <Cork> so var self = this; anotherObj.mouseHanler = function(evt) { self.mouseHandler(evt); }
[02:45:36] <Cork> ^ that is what proxy does
[02:46:37] <thember> Cork: aha! :) of course
[02:47:03] <Cork> but this will always point to its associated object, no way around that
[02:47:15] <Cork> (at least not cross browser)
[02:47:42] <thember> Cork: I got it thanks
[02:49:58] <user_corrupt> hacker noob alert: So Im using a Wordpress plugin called simple popup to generate fancybox style popups...works fine except that the css "top" value (for the main popup element) is not consistent value for safari... this value appears to be generated by the following line of code in   js/modal.php:
[02:50:01] <user_corrupt> 		jQuery(id).css('top',  winH/2-jQuery(id).height()/2);
[02:50:17] <user_corrupt> id like to replace it with just a consistent value
[02:50:37] <user_corrupt> but i dont know how to read/write the code properly is my basic issue I guess
[02:51:18] <anli> Shouldnt this supress form subscription upon enter press? http://pastebin.com/EW7Z8ku0
[02:51:19] <user_corrupt> a static value i mean
[02:52:16] <vlad_starkov> Question: What is the best testing framework today: Jasmine OR Mocha OR other?
[02:53:43] <user_corrupt> i mean can someone give me a clue as to what is going on in that line of code?
[02:53:53] <Cork> anli: no, the key event happens on the form first
[02:54:10] <user_corrupt> to effect the css "top" value i mean
[02:54:16] <Cork> anli: or rather the submit event happens first
[02:54:27] <anli> How strange is not that?
[02:54:45] <Cork> anli: why?, its two different events
[02:54:50] <Cork> .submit and .keydown
[02:54:53] <anli> One should lead to the other
[02:55:01] <anli> The order seems illogical
[02:55:01] <Cork> it doesn't
[02:55:16] <anli> If I press down enter, the form should be submitted, else not
[02:55:20] <Cork> anli: the order depends a bit on the browser
[02:55:25] <anli> Aha
[02:55:37] <Cork> anli: but in no browser does stopping the key* prevent the submit event on the form
[02:55:54] <anli> Well, if the default is prevented, it should
[02:56:02] <anli> ok
[02:56:03] <anli> well
[02:56:11] <Cork> anli: cause the enter to submit isn't actually handled by the input element
[02:56:30] <anli> Is the form tag having a onkeydown event then?
[02:56:32] <Cork> anli: sure the default keypress/up/down event is prevented
[02:56:41] <Cork> key won't matter
[02:56:57] <Cork> like i said its .submit
[02:57:33] <anli> But is there a way to check if the form was submitted by pressing enter in a box or not?
[02:57:52] <anli> Seems totally backwards
[02:58:04] <Cork> you would have to check the key event store it and use that to prevent the submission
[02:58:23] <anli> haha, ok
[02:58:29] <anli> Must try that
[02:58:39] <Cork> i don't think theres any south information in the event object
[02:58:44] <Cork> but you can check
[03:00:36] <anli> I tried your way, seems to work :) http://pastebin.com/kyUWAAV4
[03:00:53] <anli> oh, do not need to return true in the keydown handler
[03:01:23] <Cork> anli: you shouldn't ever use return <anything>;
[03:01:27] <Cork> in an event handler
[03:01:32] <Cork> use event.preventDefault()
[03:01:35] <anli> I know you think that :)
[03:01:38] <Cork> else you might break other listeners
[03:01:49] <anli> Which other listeners can there be
[03:01:55] <Cork> anli: well your force closing the event loop
[03:02:03] <anli> Isnt that a good thing?
[03:02:06] <anli> I really want to close that
[03:02:13] <anli> As much as possible
[03:02:20] <Cork> depends if you expect them to not need to do anything
[03:02:33] <anli> must go to lunch, thanks Cork for the help
[03:02:38] <Cork> but as you can't count on the event order...
[03:02:49] <anli> true
[03:03:25] <Cork> so, yes it really is a broken way of handling events, its almost as bad as dom.onclick = function() {};
[03:03:54] <Cork> (as you can't ever have more then one event listener on the element, cause then the chain breaks)
[03:08:29] <m8> Hi, how i can maniuplate a window.open() object in jquery?
[03:08:59] <Cork> m8: you mean the page in the new tab/window?
[03:09:39] <m8> yes
[03:09:45] <m8> the page in the new window
[03:10:09] <m8> i have a list with checkboxes and i want "submit" names in the parent window
[03:10:12] <Cork> i think var pop = window.open('url'); $(pop).contents().find('')
[03:10:14] <Cork> should work
[03:10:18] <Cork> not sure though
[03:10:42] <Cork> and it would only work if the page in the window is from the same domain as your
[03:10:56] <m8> good
[03:11:26] <m8> $(pop).append('<p>test</p>') will work?
[03:11:52] <Cork> no
[03:12:10] <m8> argh
[03:12:20] <Cork> $(pop).contents().append might
[03:12:26] <m8> good
[03:12:34] <Cork> $(pop).contents().find('body').append might also be what you need
[03:13:07] <Cork> though as said, haven't tested this with tabs, it works on frames, and that should work about the saem
[03:13:10] <Cork> *same
[03:15:54] <fonko> guys i have  set of fields, each field have a span id with a generic id, i would like to link each span with one field in order to show a gif for "ok" or "not ok" validation. is it possible? i was plannin to use .focusout()
[03:18:17] <m8> Cork doesn't work :|
[03:23:45] <Cork> m8: $(pop.document)
[03:23:51] <Cork> that's what you need
[03:23:54] <m8> good
[03:45:18] <fonko> guys i have  set of fields, each field have a span id with a generic id, i would like to link each span with one field in order to show a gif for "ok" or "not ok" validation. is it possible? i was plannin to use .focusout()
[03:50:55] <gamingdroid> I have a problem where I update a row, then do a summation based on all values in a certain column. Even though I make the call to update the row first, then the summation, the summation doesn't reflect the recently updated row. There is like a delay before the row is updated although there shouldn't be. Any way to ensure things happen in order?
[03:58:54] <gamingdroid> is there a way to say, do this after this function completes?
[04:04:57] <xec_> gamingdroid: how are the row updates done? any ajax involved?
[04:06:00] <gamingdroid> xec_: there are two functions in sequence. The second function call needs to wait for the first one to finish that has an ajax call in it.
[04:06:41] <tlkr> use the success callback function gamingdroid
[04:07:52] <xec_> gamingdroid: right. you'll need to call the second function when the ajax is done. you can return the deferred (what $.ajax() returns) and use .done()
[04:08:53] <gamingdroid> xec_: problem is I can't modify the ajax call to add it. If I do that, the function can no longer be used in other places.
[04:10:05] <xec_> gamingdroid: so you're asking how to fix some code that you can't modify?
[04:10:28] <tlkr> gamingdroid, add a callback function to the function which calls the ajax, and call the callback from within the success function of the ajax request if it is a function.
[04:10:36] <xec_> anyway, i'm not saying change the ajax call, i'm saying change the first function
[04:11:44] <gamingdroid> xec_: maybe what I can do is change th efirst function to accept an argument that takes in a function that gets called in the callback?
[04:12:00] <xec_> gamingdroid: that would work too
[04:12:10] <tlkr> I just said that ^^ - it's fine ignore me.
[04:12:24] <xec_> what i was suggesting is something like: function myUpdateFunction() { return $.ajax(...) };  myUpdateFunction().done(function(){ /* myUpdateFunction ajax is done, do stuff here */ })
[04:12:53] <gamingdroid> tlkr: sorry, I didn't quite understand what you meant and then it hit me. You and xec_ were the inspiration! :)
[04:13:41] <tlkr> i used the word function too many times.
[04:13:48] <gamingdroid> xec_: I never thought of that... that is a wierd pattern
[04:14:10] <gamingdroid> xec_: none the less I learned something new.
[04:14:51] <gamingdroid> in other languages there is a null value that I can signify do something spesial, but what do you in JS?
[04:15:13] <xec_> gamingdroid: what? where, for what
[04:15:27] <xec_> and/or when
[04:15:41] <xec_> and more importantly; why
[04:15:52] <gamingdroid> if I declare an argment for the first function to accept a function, then how do I signify no function or do I pass in a no-op anonymous function?
[04:16:17] <xec_> why don't you do it like i said :P
[04:16:37] <xec_> then you can add error handling as you like without having to pass another function etc
[04:16:46] <gamingdroid> xec_: I think I will since it is way cleaner, but just for my learning sake
[04:17:02] <xec_> well, a common approach is the no-op function like you said
[04:18:51] <gamingdroid> I'm realizing that I'm probably not using the right tools to do javascript stuff. Any suggestion for what tools to debug and etc?
[04:19:10] <xec_> firebug?
[04:19:15] <xec_> ?ftj
[04:19:26] <xec_> ack, where are you bot-t?
[04:19:51] <xec_> gamingdroid: if you're new to js debugging i recommend http://fixingthesejquery.com
[04:20:57] <namero999> hi everyone.
[04:21:32] <namero999> let's say I have a jquery object that matched many elements, like $('li.square')
[04:21:40] <namero999> and I call .data() on it
[04:21:59] <namero999> why does it only returns the last element's data? is there a way to get an array?
[04:22:20] <fonko> hey guys i have two different tags (one input and one span) with the same id, i want to append content to the span tag, how can i id only the span?
[04:22:39] <namero999> $("li.square").data("square-id")  I expect it to be  [1,2,3,4] and not 4
[04:23:06] <namero999> fonko, do not have multiple elements with the same id
[04:23:09] <namero999> it makes no sense
[04:23:29] <gamingdroid> namero999: perhaps you can use .each()
[04:23:38] <namero999> but try span#id
[04:23:50] <gamingdroid> xec_: that site is awesome. bookmarked!
[04:23:58] <namero999> gamingdroid, for sure I can and that is what I did. but what do you think about it?
[04:24:02] <namero999> I am considering filing a report
[04:24:09] <namero999> it is counter inutitive for me
[04:24:32] <gamingdroid> namero999: that is the jquery paradigm.... chaining stuff
[04:25:00] <namero999> but it doesn't break it
[04:25:14] <namero999> I mean, data do not return jQuery anyway
[04:25:19] <namero999> it returns Object
[04:25:21] <xec_> .data(key) breaks the chain
[04:25:46] <xec_> and yes, it only works on a single item (the first if its a collection)
[04:25:52] <namero999> data do not returns jQuery so it can return whatever it wants
[04:26:09] <xec_> so if you're retrieving multiple, a loop sounds like what you want
[04:26:21] <namero999> my idea is that if the original selector is more than one, that it should return an array of values, in my opinion. but i'm here to listen to other opinions
[04:26:24] <namero999> maybe I am missing something
[04:26:33] <fonko> namero999, actually i have one with a class and im using the class's name for the id of the span, my bad
[04:28:25] <fonko> but still... nothing is happening, i have something wrong in my code :(
[04:28:41] <xec_> fonko: can you reproduce the issue in a fiddle?
[04:32:52] <fonko> i will try
[04:35:23] <fonko> xec_, its really simple but im so newbie with this
[04:35:23] <fonko> http://jsfiddle.net/bZNac/
[04:36:53] <fonko> what am i doing wrong?
[04:38:38] <coopoola> Hi. I'm trying to build a simple script to keep the session alive on certain pages. My idea is to simply have a 10 minute timer that fires a POST to a random html page
[04:39:15] <coopoola> Is it possible to do $.post on an empty html page? I get an "405 (Method not allowed)" error in chrome when I do the following:   $.post("pingThisPage.html", function() {alert("success") } );
[04:40:00] <coopoola> I've verified that the URL posted to is correct
[04:40:53] <Altreus> Hey, I'm confused about namespacing on events. I have an input handing change events, and elsewhere I trigger the event change.address-form; I was expecting the change handler to run but it didn't.
[04:41:05] <Altreus> Do I have it backwards somehow?
[04:45:59] <cuddle> hello, quick question, I have an each loop in which I push $(this) into an array, what I need to do now is use that array for DOM traversing by doing $( ' li:has( x ) ' ), where x is the array element. anyone know how?
[04:46:21] <cuddle> it doesn't seem to work that way
[04:47:03] <cuddle> probably pretty stupid lol
[04:47:42] <Altreus> why not use .parent() or .parents() in the each to get the li that relates to them?
[04:47:53] <Altreus> or .nearest() - that's a really useful one
[04:48:06] <cuddle> oh nice, thank you
[04:48:07] <fonko> how can i append some html to a span?
[04:48:34] <cuddle> but do you think there is a way to make that work Altreus? I don't really understand how to make use of a situation like this
[04:48:43] <Altreus> I don't
[04:48:46] <fonko> i mean,  $('#User[contact_name]').html("<img src=http://www.domain.com/asdf.jpg >");           its not working i think it should be working!
[04:48:54] <Altreus> You have an array of objects, and you want li:has(object)
[04:49:02] <Altreus> That is the same as doing object.nearest('li')
[04:49:09] <Altreus> except much less efficient
[04:49:40] <Altreus> fonko: html changes the html /inside/ the element. Did you want replaceWith?
[04:49:47] <cuddle> I see, still figuring things out, thanks
[04:50:01] <Altreus> fonko: also you should use single quotes for that string because you need the double quotes to go around the src
[04:50:16] <Altreus> afk
[04:51:31] <coppa> Altreus is this closest you are talking about or there is a nearest function i did not know
[04:51:42] <coppa> a plugin ?
[04:52:19] <coppa> (came in the middle of the conversation)
[04:53:51] <fonko> Altreus, nothing is working man :(
[04:54:15] <fonko> when i go off with focus from inputs... i can show an alert but i cant place nothing in this span tag :(
[04:54:27] <fonko> http://jsfiddle.net/bZNac/3/
[04:55:53] <fonko> im so frustrated :(
[04:57:21] <fonko> i mean, i only want to show some txt when the focus is lost in an input, could that be so difficult???
[04:58:15] <Logikos> i'm haveing trouble with jquery's .data()  .. clearly i'm doing something wrong, can someone please take a look at this fiddle, just have console open then click in the gray box
[04:58:16] <Logikos> http://jsfiddle.net/E3DAr/
[04:58:34] <Altreus> coppa: sorry, yes - closest
[04:58:36] <Logikos> expected result is to calculate the time between the mouse goes down and when it comes up
[04:59:32] <Logikos> all i wana do is figure out how long they held the mouse down for ( to distiniguise between a click and drag for panning and just a normal click)
[05:00:40] <chrisr> Is there a better way of doing this :  http://jsfiddle.net/agW83   I feel like I'm missing something fundamental and there's a better way of doing it.
[05:01:39] <chrisr> Specifically, the way I pass "this" into the method seems wrong.
[05:01:47] <fonko> plz help :(
[05:02:00] <Altreus> chrisr: why not pass $(this)
[05:02:13] <Altreus> chrisr: also jQuery auto-parses data-* into .data()
[05:02:32] <fr4nk> fonko: i think the selector is wron
[05:02:33] <fr4nk> g*
[05:02:33] <Altreus> it turns the hyphen-separated-name into humpedCaps
[05:02:50] <chrisr> Altreus: I thought there was a way of not having to pass in "this" or "$(this)"
[05:03:03] <fr4nk> fonko: $('span[id*=User]').html('qwe'); works for me
[05:03:04] <Altreus> chrisr: you can addTestSchedule.call(this)
[05:03:08] <Altreus> Then you get the same this
[05:03:11] <fr4nk> http://jsfiddle.net/bZNac/3/
[05:03:22] <Logikos> fonko u want the onblur event
[05:03:31] <Altreus> chrisr: http://jsfiddle.net/agW83/2/ like that
[05:03:46] <Altreus> chrisr: or simply put addTestSchedule in as the handler
[05:04:02] <Altreus> chrisr: liek this http://jsfiddle.net/agW83/3/
[05:04:07] <Altreus> Man like is hard to spell
[05:04:09] <Altreus> afk, noms
[05:04:19] <Logikos> I'm trying to find out how long the mouse is down for a click event, but its not working, what am i doing wrong please? http://jsfiddle.net/E3DAr/
[05:04:29] <chrisr> Altreus: ah yes thanks, that last one is what I wanted.
[05:04:48] <fonko> ouch! i think i cant call an id like this "something[somethingelse]" i mean i just named it normal... like "something" and it worked!
[05:05:02] <fonko> now im lost, how am i supposed to do it ! grrr hahaha
[05:05:23] <seutje> fonko: u can, just have to escape it
[05:06:50] <fonko> seutje, thanks !!!!!! :)
[05:07:32] <seutje> fonko: actually, correction: u have to double-escape it: http://jsfiddle.net/aFkFV/
[05:09:59] <fr4nk> seutje: why that double escape? to escape to one \ that escapes the [ ?? *urgh*
[05:10:04] <seutje> chrisr: for manipulating context, see proxy
[05:10:31] <seutje> fr4nk: iono, I usually don't end up with attributes I need to escape :P
[05:10:35] <chrisr> Altreus: I know about data(), but my code has to work in IE6 and I'm scared so I thought I'd just play it safe.
[05:10:56] <fr4nk> seutje: jeah me to, jsut wondering :)
[05:11:00] <fr4nk> *too
[05:11:13] <seutje> chrisr: if the version of jQuery ur using supports IE6, it should work just fine afaik
[05:11:22] <piker32> is posting files asynch with jquery still a huge cross browser bees nest?
[05:12:05] <Cork> piker32: its stabilizing somewhat, but yes, ie is still making it a mess
[05:14:15] <piker32> ok, so there is no shame heading down the iframe with form posting route?
[05:15:27] <Cork> piker32: well there is helper objects that makes it all quite transparent
[05:15:34] <Cork> that uses what the browser supports
[05:15:50] <piker32> any links to said resources?
[05:15:56] <Cork> html5 > flash > silverlight > google gears > some other > iframe
[05:16:25] <Cork> ?g pload

[05:16:33] <bot-t> Cork, Plupload - A tool for uploading files using Flash, Silverlight, Google ... - http://www.plupload.com/
[05:17:24] <piker32> im looking for support back to IE7
[05:17:37] <piker32> id rather like to avoid silverlight or flash
[05:17:40] <Cork> it should have support back to at least ie6
[05:17:51] <Cork> you can pick what plugins you want to use
[05:18:10] <Cork> and like i said its transparent
[05:18:17] <Cork> it depends on what the users browser support
[05:18:32] <piker32> ah ok, yea looks that way, was firing off questions as i skimmed
[05:19:19] <pandeiro> why doesn't $.data() work with HTML5 data-* attributes?
[05:19:38] <pandeiro> .data() does, but $.data() doesn't? (1.8.2)
[05:19:56] <Cork> cause $.data is a backbone function
[05:20:14] <adac> Hi guys. How can I get back text of div 1 in this example: https://gist.github.com/4059346     $('#1').text() gives me additionally the text of div 2
[05:21:29] <Mandevil> Hello folks.
[05:21:43] <Mandevil> I have 'load' event hook on <select>, that seems not to be firing...
[05:21:47] <fonko> guys, my input name attr happend to be my span id, so im getting this att name in a variable and then i want to do something like $('#'+var).html('something'); but its not working
[05:21:54] <pandeiro> Cork: hunh?
[05:22:07] <Cork> adac: you would have to clone the div, and remove the child div
[05:22:16] <seutje> Mandevil: why load?
[05:22:20] <fonko> i need to collect this name id on the fly and use it to trigger some other things, how can i do that?
[05:22:25] <adac> Cork, ok I see. thank you!
[05:22:35] <Cork> pandeiro: $.data is a backbond function, its used for access the cache
[05:22:50] <Mandevil> seutje: I want to populate the select list on page load.
[05:23:05] <Cork> pandeiro: if you want to pull in attributes it needs to be called on the jquery wrapped dom element
[05:23:23] <seutje> Mandevil: so it's page load u want to fire it on, doc rdy should do
[05:23:37] <Trisox> hey seutje and Cork
[05:23:40] <pandeiro> Cork: that is why $.data() is so much faster I take it
[05:23:42] <Cork> adac: best option is to wrapp the text in its own span
[05:23:44] <seutje> hey
[05:23:45] <Mandevil> seutje: Hm, didn't occur to me.
[05:23:50] <Cork> adac: and just grab that span
[05:23:53] <fonko> actually its working but again, i think there is an issue with scapeing [
[05:23:55] <Mandevil> seutje: Still, load should work...
[05:24:00] <Cork> pandeiro: among other reasons
[05:24:07] <seutje> Mandevil: not rly
[05:24:24] <Mandevil> I'm actually doing this from the document.ready() section.
[05:24:29] <seutje> Mandevil: either the element doesn't exist when ur trying to bind load to it, or it's already loaded
[05:24:30] <Mandevil> But maybe I'm even missing the event.
[05:24:42] <Mandevil> seutje: The latter is certainly true.
[05:24:42] <seutje> Mandevil: in that case: it's already loaded
[05:24:48] <Mandevil> I get it.
[05:24:54] <Mandevil> Thanks :)
[05:25:18] <seutje> Mandevil: load is more for async things like iframes and images (images is an exception actually, and an annoying one)
[05:26:58] <Cork> seutje: actually, no img is more like <object> then a div
[05:27:07] <Mandevil> Works now, thanks :)
[05:27:10] <Cork> seutje: as its replaced by the externally loaded data it needs a load event
[05:29:09] <seutje> Cork: uhm how is that not what I said?
[05:31:05] <Cork> seutje: image is exactly like iframes or objects, not an exception
[05:31:43] <seutje> iframe cache hits still trigger load, don't they?
[05:31:51] <seutje> coz img cache hits dont
[05:33:02] <seutje> to the fiddle-mobile!
[05:35:19] <Cork> seutje: onload triggers even if its loaded from cache
[05:35:26] <sh0ne> how to check if variable has NULL value? I tried: if (typeof some_var === null) nut it isn't working
[05:35:38] <Cork> seutje: else many of my repload scripts would fail
[05:35:57] <xec_> fonko: sorry, was afk. did you get help?
[05:36:12] <Cork> ?eval typeof(sdkfhsdkfh) === "undefined"
[05:36:14] <bot-t> Cork: true
[05:36:50] <Cork> ?eval var sdkfhsdkfh = null; typeof(sdkfhsdkfh) === "null"
[05:36:52] <bot-t> Cork: false
[05:36:55] <Cork> hmm
[05:36:59] <Cork> ?eval var sdkfhsdkfh = null; typeof(sdkfhsdkfh)
[05:37:00] <bot-t> Cork: "object"
[05:37:05] <Cork> ah right
[05:37:56] <sh0ne> Cork: allright, thank you very much
[05:38:11] <Cork> sh0ne: not really an answer though
[05:38:20] <Mandevil> Every time I cut'n'paste something in my code, I have a nagging feeling that I'm doing something wrong.
[05:38:23] <Cork> i rememberd that null is a tricky one
[05:38:27] <Cork> there is a workaround though
[05:38:39] <sh0ne> Cork: I'll check isPlainObject or something similar
[05:39:50] <Cork> sh0ne: simplest solution is prob to set it to undefined instead of null
[05:40:30] <Cork> ah it was that simple :)
[05:40:43] <Cork> sh0ne: if you want just null do variable === null
[05:40:50] <Cork> no typeof
[05:41:37] <Cork> ?eval var v = null;if(v === null) { 'YUP!' }
[05:41:38] <bot-t> Cork: "YUP!"
[05:41:43] <Cork> ?eval if(v === null) { 'YUP!' }
[05:41:44] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: v is not defined
[05:41:49] <sh0ne> Cork: hehehe, yes, you're right...it works now :) thank you
[05:42:06] <Cork> ?eval if(typeof(v) !== 'undefined && v === null) { 'YUP!' }
[05:42:07] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ) after condition
[05:42:17] <Cork> ?eval if(typeof(v) !== 'undefined' && v === null) { 'YUP!' }
[05:42:17] <bot-t> Cork: undefined
[05:42:50] <superlukas> console.log($('#container')); returns jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[1], whats up with that? never seen this guy before
[05:44:07] <seutje> Cork: odd, previous experience and things like https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/ say otherwise
[05:46:53] <Mandevil> Is there event for when an DOM element becomes _visible_?
[05:47:00] <Mandevil> Like when switching tabs.
[05:49:15] <seutje> Mandevil: u prolly want to have the tabs plugin fire a callback, otherwise u'd have to use a mutation observer, which aren't very widely supported
[05:49:21] <Cork> seutje: ya, you can miss the event if you don't bind it before you give it an url
[05:49:36] <Cork> seutje: but thats true for iframes and objects too
[05:49:45] <seutje> Cork: it also doesn't fire on this.src = this.src
[05:50:05] <Cork> ya, cause that's not an url change
[05:50:15] <seutje> it is for objects/iframes though
[05:50:21] <Cork> this.src = this.src + '#' should though
[05:50:40] <seutje> prolly
[05:52:42] <seutje> anyway, my point was just that images can be a bit problematic sometimes, in comparison with iframes and such
[05:53:32] <seutje> if I had a penny for everyone who came through here who was struggling with img.load...
[05:54:00] <seutje> I'd still be poor, coz dollars are so worthless nowadays :(
[05:57:17] <Cork> lol
[06:00:18] <rabbite> still can't figure out why this isn't swapping values $('.fb-like').prop('data-href', url);
[06:00:40] <Cork> rabbite: data- can't really be a prop
[06:00:42] <Cork> you want attr
[06:00:45] <Cork> or .data
[06:01:02] <rabbite> ahh
[06:01:07] <rabbite> thought that might be an issue
[06:02:14] <rabbite> herm, still nothing with .attr
[06:02:29] <rabbite> would it be .data('href', url); ??
[06:02:43] <Cork> what is it you're trying to do?
[06:02:44] <rabbite> or .data('data-href', url) ?
[06:03:01] <adac> Cork, should text always best be wrapped in span's?
[06:03:04] <rabbite> swap the value in data-href with a user input url
[06:03:13] <Cork> .data('href', url) or attr('data-href', url) should match <elm data-href="">
[06:03:24] <Cork> by swap you mean replace right?
[06:03:27] <rabbite> adac: not always, could wrap text in <p> or <h> tags...
[06:03:32] <rabbite> Cork: yes
[06:03:35] <Cork> cause url won't be replaced with whats in the href
[06:03:46] <Cork> then both should work
[06:04:34] <rabbite> the , url is the bit that's being put into the data-href, right?
[06:04:46] <Cork> yes
[06:05:01] <Cork> .data won't actually update the attribute though
[06:05:09] <Cork> it will store it in jquery's cache
[06:05:11] <rabbite> .attr dpesm
[06:05:13] <Cork> .attr will though
[06:05:17] <rabbite> *doesn't either
[06:05:20] <Cork> it does
[06:05:23] <jacta> Does anyone know a way to make something like "strike text to remove"
[06:05:26] <rabbite> $('.fb-like').attr('data-href', 'http://www.facebook.com/50cent');
[06:05:36] <rabbite> i tried that, still doesn't update the data-href
[06:06:08] <marvi> I have an issue with Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery. http://jsfiddle.net/LFzbf/   Click event happens before the button is set to active, so it is missing in my each. Is there an other event I can use? $('result') should include all buttons selected.
[06:06:20] <Cork> rabbite: your trying to modify multiple elements?
[06:06:23] <rabbite> i'm using an alert before and after that line, the url isn't being updated
[06:06:26] <rabbite> nah, just one
[06:06:45] <rabbite> http://jsfiddle.net/R3qat/
[06:06:51] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/saJL5/show/
[06:06:54] <Cork> wfm
[06:08:16] <Cork> rabbite: you're caching the result
[06:08:25] <rabbite> i'm not sure i understand
[06:08:42] <rabbite> it's being stored in the javascript layer, but not being pushed to the page?
[06:08:43] <Cork> var button_href = $('.fb-like').attr('data-href'); <-- that creates a copy not a pointer
[06:08:52] <rabbite> ahh
[06:09:23] <rabbite> so cache the url, but not the button got it
[06:09:38] <Fofr_> Hi, I need to initialise some plugin when new element is appended to some container. What is the proper way to do it? Is there some way, how to say $('.someClass').initMyPluging() that means, when I append new element with 'someClass' it will automatically initialise that plugin?
[06:09:56] <Cork> rabbite: no, its fine to cache the button
[06:10:11] <Fofr_> Simply something like 'live' selector
[06:10:16] <Cork> rabbite: but not the result from .attr/.prop/.anything ON that button
[06:10:25] <rabbite> well i can tell i don't need the var part, because I'm calling it again in the swap line
[06:10:32] <Cork> rabbite: so button = $('.fb-like'); button.attr()
[06:10:34] <chrisr> What's the name for javascript that only exists in the script files and is not intermingled with the html?
[06:10:55] <Cork> rabbite: ya, but you should cache the jquery selector result
[06:11:19] <rabbite> i.e. "http://www.facebook.com/acme" ?
[06:11:44] <Cork> rabbite: no i gave you what you should be using
[06:11:53] <Cork> var button = $('.fb-like');
[06:11:59] <Cork> button.attr()
[06:13:17] <rabbite> button_href.attr('data-href', url);
[06:14:02] <Cork> as long as that not that variable isn't refering to a href (as the name suggests, yes)
[06:14:10] <Cork> *as long as that variable
[06:14:23] <webdev> hello all.

[06:17:13] <mattyh88> could somebody here with ie8 installed test a site for me ? (to see how an effect on my page renders)
[06:17:54] <rabbite> Cork: browser? I'm running chrome. the button isn't updating :(
[06:18:36] <marvi> mattyh88: Browserstack has a free trail.
[06:18:52] <mattyh88> ah i'll check that out thx
[06:21:03] <toxz> in chrome i have the wanted behaviour with the scrolling event... in firefox + ie not :-(   - any ideas?     http://jsfiddle.net/ezVPE/
[06:22:39] <rhelic> I have this dual multiselect box and I want a double click to trigger the add/remove action but what I wrote didn't work, what did I overlook?  http://jsfiddle.net/bUsHT/3/
[06:27:48] <coppa> toxZ : sure you don't want to do console.log($('.overlay').offset().top);
[06:27:52] <coppa> ?
[06:28:06] <coppa> be carefull using class selector btw..
[06:28:35] <toxz> coppa - its just an example. i want the yellow box to stay in the viewport while scrolling down
[06:29:34] <coppa> this is working on my firefox (16)
[06:30:13] <maasha> I have a JSON string representing a tree and want to add a <div> to each node. So far I managed to get the JSON parsed: var tree = jQuery.parseJSON('<JSON string>');
[06:30:26] <danmichel> I added $('#home_conta').load(<?php "'" . get_template_directory() . '/loop-slideshow.php' . " #featured'" ?>); to my test site, http://theplural.com/ but I'm not sure if it's working because the site loads instantly for me, as it's my home server. basically trying to load what's in that div asynchronously
[06:30:27] <coppa> ah no sorry that s true
[06:30:30] <coppa> i changed to  var offset = 100 + $(this).scrollTop();
[06:30:34] <coppa> and became ok
[06:32:03] <maasha> I have looked at jQuery('<div/>', {}).appendTo, but I cant get the syntax right.
[06:32:41] <toxz> coppa - ah thx. this is document
[06:32:49] <toxz> coppa - it seems to work
[06:33:09] <toxz> mmm but i dont understand 100% why
[06:33:38] <seutje> maasha: it helps to show what syntax you're trying
[06:33:39] <maasha> $(tree).each( function(i) { jQuery('<div/>', {}).appendTo(this)} )
[06:34:11] <seutje> maasha: so u just throz the JSON object in $()?
[06:34:17] <seutje> throw*
[06:34:46] <maasha> seutje: well, yes?
[06:34:54] <seutje> maasha: I think you're looking for $.each(tree, function(){});
[06:35:39] <maasha> seutje: http://pastie.org/5365887 - I was going to start with the most simple form of each iteration.
[06:35:47] <seutje> also, "this" within the loop refers to the element currently being looped over, considering it's an object/array/string from the return data, I doubt u can append to it
[06:36:25] <maasha> seutje: I can append - but it doesnt do anything!
[06:36:36] <maasha> as far as I can tell.
[06:36:59] <toxz> danmichel - http://theplural.com/  - there are some boobs on the page - woohhoo
[06:37:25] <seutje> maasha: what are u trying to do?
[06:37:28] <danmichel> i guess so toxz
[06:37:58] <maasha> seutje: I want to display the JSON tree as a HTML tree with embedded divs for the nodes.
[06:38:31] <seutje> maasha: like, nested?
[06:38:35] <maasha> seutje: yes
[06:38:42] <seutje> oh dear
[06:38:48] <maasha> :/
[06:39:43] <marvi> maasha: for debug or styled for users?
[06:41:01] <maasha> marvi: I am playing and learning some javascript here.
[06:41:52] <seutje> maasha: jstree can do that
[06:42:29] <marvi> I use a lib called jsonreport to show json data in a widget for debug.
[06:42:44] <bigpoopy> hi
[06:43:04] <seutje> I use console.log, but hey, I'm bas-shit crazy, Im told
[06:43:08] <seutje> bad*
[06:43:17] <xec_> bat*
[06:43:18] <marvi> https://github.com/AjaxStack/AjaxStack/tree/master/src/jsonreport
[06:43:45] <seutje> oh, that's how the saying goes? being guano crazy?
[06:44:00] <maasha> seutje: I know. I just need to start somewhere simpler for learning.
[06:44:13] <xec_> seutje: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bat-shit+crazy
[06:44:22] <xec_> lol @ tom cruise reference
[06:45:02] <bigpoopy> http://newsignature.github.com/us-map/ - i am trying to make each state present its own information. can not get it to work by following the manual :/
[06:50:07] <xec_> bigguano: could you make a jsfiddle.net demonstrating your issue? hard to tell what's wrong when you just link us to a demo page that's working fine ;)
[06:51:28] <retrostyle|15> hi ho
[06:51:51] <xec_> it's also hard to take someone with the word "guano" in their nick seriously. maybe change it to something more friendly like "poopy" instead. oh wait it IS! nevermind
[06:52:07] <bigpoopy> :P
[06:52:25] <retrostyle|15> hey ho
[06:52:27] <danmichel> I added $('#home_conta').load(<?php "'" . get_template_directory() . '/loop-slideshow.php' . " #featured'" ?>); to my test site, http://theplural.com/ but I'm not sure if it's working because the site loads instantly for me, as it's my home server. basically trying to load what's in that div asynchronously  . the site is loading the same as my live site http://varmag.com/
[06:52:38] <xec_> ?ask @ retrostyle|13
[06:52:39] <bot-t> retrostyle|13, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:53:09] <bigpoopy> i gotta redo the code i went crazy last night and tried some html5 stuff to no avail
[06:53:10] <retrostyle|15> anyone know a best practice for storing user credentials on mobile clients (cross domain)
[06:53:45] <xec_> danmichel: why don't you put the .load() call on a button click or something (so it doesn't happen immediately)
[06:54:02] <retrostyle|15> it should be safe
[06:54:17] <retrostyle|15> +secure
[06:54:19] <danmichel> its a slider. i don't want people to have to click it xec_
[06:54:58] <xec_> danmichel: that way you can see if it works or not, your issue was that it loaded instantly?
[06:55:16] <danmichel> oh, i see
[06:56:06] <danmichel> hmm ok i don't know how to do that
[06:56:10] <danmichel> thanks anyways
[07:02:50] <Cork> rabbite: not sure what button your depending on, but if you check in the dom you see that data-href is updated
[07:02:58] <Cork> rabbite: thats all i can say
[07:03:07] <rabbite> I solved the problem
[07:03:18] <rabbite> basically, i needed FB.XFBML.parse();
[07:03:24] <Cork> ah
[07:03:31] <rabbite> at the end of my function, to tell FB to update the button
[07:03:41] <rabbite> so what you showed me was correct. :D
[07:05:41] <bigpoopy> http://jsfiddle.net/sccP5/
[07:06:05] <Imaginativeone> is jQTouch essentially jQueryMobile?
[07:06:11] <scathen^C> i am having trouble doing something I thought should be simple. I am trying to show() a text area, and then focus() it. Any ideas why the focus part would not be working?
[07:06:44] <marvi> I solved my Bootstrap issue. Can't use the built in data-toggle in Bootstrap. Have to toggle myself: http://jsfiddle.net/LFzbf/9/
[07:07:15] <Imaginativeone> scathen^C: order?
[07:07:41] <xec_> bigpoopy: use the "add resources" on the left hand side to add external scripts
[07:08:03] <xec_> bigpoopy: also, no html in the javascript field, more like this http://jsfiddle.net/sccP5/1/
[07:09:45] <scathen^C> nvm my bad. was trying to focus the parent div, not the textarea itself.
[07:09:48] <scathen^C> thanks though
[07:09:56] <bigpoopy> ok
[07:10:13] <scathen^C> don't you hate it how as soon as you ask in irc you think of the answer
[07:10:27] <gamingdroid> from a js standpoint, is it better to declare a anonymous function and assign it to a var, or decleare it the normal way function function_name() {}..?
[07:11:36] <blackspotwiggins> gamingdroid, there is little difference
[07:12:05] <gamingdroid> what about from syntax perspective, I would imagine the latter is clearer?
[07:12:35] <Cork> gamingdroid: function name() {} is parsed before the js is ran, var name = function() {}; is parsed when the engine gets there while running the code
[07:13:16] <gamingdroid> Cork: thanks!
[07:13:29] <Cork> gamingdroid: seen from the syntax theres little difference
[07:13:42] <Cork> function name() {} is normally seen as the cleaner one
[07:13:46] <Cork> as you have a named function
[07:14:30] <gamingdroid> Cork: but it seems if you do certain things like dynamically add stuff, then having deferred would be better. Might get some weird bugs otherwise.
[07:15:21] <Cork> gamingdroid: for callbacks, yes it tents to be cleaner; IF you build your code that way
[07:15:22] <bigpoopy> http://jsfiddle.net/sccP5/2/
[07:15:32] <Cork> another way builds the function globally, and reuse them
[07:15:42] <Cork> so it matters a lot on how you write your code
[07:15:48] <Cork> (prefer to write)
[07:16:29] <Cork> ?eval function name() {};name.prototype.constructor.name
[07:16:33] <bot-t> Cork: "name"
[07:16:38] <Cork> ?eval var name = function() {};name.prototype.constructor.name
[07:16:38] <bot-t> Cork: ""
[07:16:47] <xec_> bigpoopy: doesn
[07:16:50] <xec_> gah
[07:16:58] <Cork> theres one debugging downside to anonymous functions
[07:16:58] <xec_> who put the ' key right next to enter?
[07:17:15] <Cork> xec: ya, i know, i hate that too
[07:17:19] <xec_> bigpoopy: it doesn't look like the links are working
[07:17:28] <bigpoopy> i see that :(
[07:17:31] <xec_> bigpoopy: try full urls with http:// in front
[07:17:41] <bigpoopy> i did :/
[07:17:57] <bigpoopy> oh
[07:17:59] <bigpoopy> nevermind
[07:18:00] <bigpoopy> i lied
[07:19:30] <bigpoopy> forgot the svg too :(
[07:19:31] <bigpoopy> lol
[07:21:42] <bigpoopy> still not working
[07:22:43] <fonko> guys, what means to do this?  $('#someid').addClass('ctrlHolder error indicator');
[07:23:02] <fonko> because i want to ad my span (wich has id=someid) those classes
[07:23:11] <fonko> but i dont want to add that added up to ID attr.
[07:23:19] <fonko> wich i suspect is happening
[07:23:20] <Cork> you add the classes ctrlHolder, error and indicator to the element #someid
[07:24:06] <john-dev> .addClass will not add anything to the id attribute..
[07:24:15] <john-dev> obviously
[07:24:15] <Cork> ?.addClass
[07:24:17] <bot-t> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[07:25:43] <sethetter> fonko: addClass will only add the classes to the class attribute on the element with the given ID, it will not affect the ID
[07:27:48] <fonko> its weird because im not being able to do what i need
[07:28:19] <sethetter> fonko: put your code in a jsfiddle or something so we can see it
[07:28:34] <fonko> thats good idea
[07:28:45] <fonko> but wait, it may be easier
[07:28:48] <fonko> than i think
[07:28:57] <sethetter> fonko: that's normal protocol if you're asking for help here
[07:28:58] <fonko> i have a template designed by the designer
[07:29:06] <fonko> sure i understand that
[07:29:16] <fonko> ok i'll do taht
[07:29:21] <fonko> it may clear out things for me also
[07:36:48] <rabbite> anyone know if .remove() is recursive? Will it delete any children of elements targeted>
[07:39:57] <RLa> using jquery-mobile and updating page dynamically, it won't always apply css for dynamically added elements
[07:41:22] <rabbite> answered my own question ;)
[07:44:42] <fonko> well guys
[07:44:48] <fonko> actually i dont know how to test this here
[07:44:50] <fonko> but
[07:44:52] <fonko> http://jsfiddle.net/bzt7j/
[07:44:53] <fonko> there it is
[07:45:11] <fonko> im just trying things
[07:45:49] <fonko> and actually what im trying now is to add this css .standard-form .ctrlHolder.error .indicator to my span tag, because that would show my cross image
[07:46:00] <fonko> but im not being able to do that
[07:47:38] <sethetter> fonko: The first problem I see is that you're trying to target something as an ID without an actual ID on the element
[07:48:10] <sethetter> $('#'+target) isn't going to correspond to the span you're trying to manipulate because the span doesn't even have an ID. "#" is the prefix for ID selectors
[07:48:22] <fonko> sorry
[07:48:28] <fonko> i paste the wrong set of div
[07:48:34] <fonko> because im using yii framework
[07:48:35] <fonko> so...
[07:48:39] <fonko> ok give me 1 sec
[07:48:45] <sethetter> Not familiar with that framework.
[07:49:00] <xec_> did you mean yui?
[07:49:13] <xec_> nevermind, yii is actually a thing
[07:49:43] <fonko> http://jsfiddle.net/bzt7j/2/
[07:49:45] <fonko> there it is
[07:50:10] <fonko> i mean yii (yes it is) framework
[07:50:38] <xec_> lol, is that what it stands for?
[07:50:49] <fonko> maybe a simple question may help me, what does it means to have css like this: .something.error .somethingelse
[07:51:11] <fonko> i mean how would that look like in the actual "style=" attribuite?
[07:51:20] <fonko> xec_, yup
[07:51:32] <xec_> that's hilarious :)
[07:51:37] <fonko> xec_, i know haha
[07:51:54] <fonko> well, php meaning personal home page... kind of also !
[07:51:57] <fonko> lol
[07:52:43] <sethetter> fonko: .something.error .somethingelse is targeting an element with class "somethingelse" that's inside of an element with both classes "something" and "error".
[07:52:44] <fonko> html "here, take my leg" o.O
[07:53:09] <xec_> anyway, fonko, by looking at your code it looks like you're setting two variables, target and valor - right? inside the focusout.. and you're trying to use the target var outside of scope
[07:53:46] <xec_> what is it supposed to do?
[07:54:03] <bigpoopy> http://jsfiddle.net/sccP5/9/
[07:54:10] <bigpoopy> i try to set <event>State to click
[07:54:13] <bigpoopy> and it doesn't work
[07:54:18] <fonko> sorry xec_ actually i had to set it like that because all that is an ajax call
[07:54:20] <fonko> haha its a mess
[07:54:45] <fonko> it actually need to add class error or ok to my span tag in order to ajax validate fields
[07:54:57] <fonko> sethetter, thanks for that answer... processing now haha
[07:56:34] <sethetter> fonko: I think the code you provided may be too far out of context to really help. I get what you're trying to do but this code is a ways off from doing it, and I don't see any sort of validation running to either return 'ok' or 'error'
[07:57:42] <fonko> i only need to know how to add the correct css to the span, if it happends to be true (ok) or false (cross) from my ajax call
[07:57:48] <sethetter> fonko: I'm thinking the issue may be in CSS more so than the jQuery
[07:57:58] <Jagst3r15> anyone here ever use datatables.net/index ?
[07:58:09] <fonko> true sethetter
[07:58:20] <fonko> i need to add this inside the brackets .standard-form .ctrlHolder.error .indicator { background-position:  0 100%; }
[07:58:28] <fonko> to show error indicator in my span tag
[07:58:36] <fonko> but im not being able to do it correctly, i suck at css
[07:58:57] <sethetter> fonko: looking at the markup, i think what you need is .standard-form .ctrlHolder .indicator.error
[08:00:58] <anli> I think I have to 3x3 style a button, is that possible?
[08:01:06] <anli> left edge, topleft corner etc
[08:01:49] <anli> Is multiple backgrounds the way to go?
[08:03:01] <hdon> hi all :) anyone here use Sencha Labs' PhiloGL framework?
[08:03:08] <sethetter> fonko: Also, we can't see the background image because it's not hosted on jsfiddle
[08:04:21] <sethetter> fonko: http://jsfiddle.net/bzt7j/3/
[08:04:55] <sethetter> fonko: I changed the class selectors a bit and in place of the "background-position" shift I added a red border to the span to show that it does recieve the classes correctly.
[08:14:15] <Jagst3r15> i used http://datatables.net/index instead, but how come i cant sort the damn tables
[08:14:28] <Jagst3r15> i called it right because the search and stuff is there
[08:14:35] <Jagst3r15> http://jagst3r15.com/scholarships360/table-of-scholarships/
[08:21:21] <DaFireball> guys, anyone knows a great blog article of a, I believe it was a "red colored" sports, website where they have a jQuery slider to compare the old design with the new design (you can drag it horizontally)
[08:21:39] <DaFireball> can't find it anymore.. I know it sounds vague but hope someone knows what I mean :)
[08:23:41] <DaFireball> if it is a jQuery slider anyway..
[08:25:21] <zfly9> Hey guys I am using this jQuery plugin to customize the <select> option in a form... The only problem is, the form I am using is generated via javascript.. I put a test <select> form that is not generated via js and it works goo.gl/cQxK6, but if you see the contact form in the footer, it doesn't work on that one (select form is hidden from the css that comes with the plugin)
[08:25:49] <zfly9> ^ but you're able to see if you inspect the element that the <select> is still intact and the plugin didn't change it
[08:30:18] <AaronCampbell> Is there a good way to add additional data to a form that's being posted via AJAX?  Basically if the form is submitted I want it to send the elements already in it, but if it's submitted via AJAX I want to include two additional pieces of data.
[08:38:19] <DaFireball> never mind, got it: http://www.f-i.com/cnn/
[08:44:08] <john-dev> AaronCampbell, sure there is, using $.ajax or $.post
[08:44:44] <john-dev> basic $.post example: $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[08:48:58] <AaronCampbell> john-dev: I was thinking something that would let me use $('#my-form').serialize() since there are quite a few elements in the form, and then augment it by adding a couple additional fields
[08:57:13] <gamingdroid> I'm struggling to find a way to identify if something is an integer number?
[08:58:51] <gamingdroid> the $.isNumeric() only checks if a "something" is a number, not if it is an integer
[09:02:39] <lontrax> Please, how can I do to prevent open a link in new window, getting the "href" well:   <a href="#">My Link</a>   ?
[09:03:09] <Haprog> return false
[09:03:51] <Haprog> or even better to call event.preventDefault()
[09:03:53] <Haprog> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:05:17] <lontrax> Haprog: cool.. thanks!! ;) I will try
[09:27:36] <erik-landvall> sup's dudes.. I wrote a plugin for jQuery I'm having some problems with in FF. Here's a link to the page where it's used: e-juice.nu/produkter
[09:27:53] <erik-landvall> when hovering the thumbs is when u see it
[09:28:16] <erik-landvall> I think it has to do with the fact that moseout triggers on enter
[09:28:35] <erik-landvall> Could someone come up with a way for me to fix this?
[09:43:32] <lontrax> Please, about prevent opening link in new window... it's my solution, but does not work as I would like: http://jsbin.com/avobuc/1/edit     if I click the link with the left mouse button works properly, but if I right click and open the link in a new window, the link will open, as I avoid open link in new window? is this possible?
[09:55:17] <bil`> when using .map and .each, if 'this' maps to the current element, whats the point of the element method argument?
[10:10:05] <koopajah> Hey everyone! I'm implementing a grid in html/JS like google's spreadsheet and I have an issue with handle TAB key in firefox. I have a global handler on keydown event on $(document) and when I am on the last cell, I trigger a click on a button to add a new line. But in firefox, the browser also give the focus to another element in the page (the logout button). Does anyone know how to prevent
[10:10:05] <koopajah> this ?
[10:13:09] <RLa> koopajah, calling preventDefault on the event?
[10:14:31] <koopajah> RLa > that's the problem. It works fine on google chrome, even on firefox under Linux but on windows it does not work. same for stopPropagation() and stopImmediatePropagation. It even seems that the element has the focus BEFORE my event handler is called
[10:15:46] <RLa> how you add the handler?
[10:15:55] <RLa> hm, with jquery
[10:16:05] <koopajah> yes
[10:16:48] <MistuhKurtz> you can trigger focus koopajah
[10:17:19] <Heather_> whas the most effiecent way to pass around data? I craete a data attribute right now on each link but that seems a bit redundant. I figured I use some kind of placeholder and collect the data from there for each link but then I need to be able to identify that specific element and to do that I need the data. There has to be some way?
[10:17:47] <Heather_> data attribute on elements that is
[10:17:56] <koopajah> MistuhKurtz > tried to focus my new cell in the grid (which is a div) with  cell.focus() and cell.trigger('focus') without success. I even trigger a click on the cell (which gives focus) but the logout button still keeps its focus
[10:22:33] <NoiseEee> Heather_: you could always have an object holding all that info; ie: keep it out of the DOM
[10:23:17] <objnoob>  the easiest way to not specific the return data type for jQuery ajax and to determine the type between text and json ?
[10:23:25] <objnoob> if(typeof resp == 'object')
[10:23:34] <objnoob> would that work?
[10:28:35] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm trying to make a single-page js app, and I've been reviewing the router/path libraries available. None of them seem to have functionality to route "no path". They work for mysite.com/#/foo/bar but not just mysite.com -- how is this traditionally handled?
[10:35:38] <someprimetime> timwis: your question is better off in #documentcloud
[10:36:44] <devone> can anyone take a look at a jsfiddle here and point me in the right direction? i'm trying to author a plugin and have my own prototype on the obj returned
[10:38:04] <devone> ah wait think i found a guide finally
[10:39:47] <code_ph0y> hey guys can someone tell me how do make an element follow the page only if the element reaches a point that its not going to be viewed because its going out of the viewing pane
[10:40:11] <code_ph0y> do = to
[10:42:02] <bung> what do you mean follow the page
[10:47:38] <zfly9> Hey guys I am using this jQuery plugin to customize the <select> option in a form... The only problem is, the form I am using is generated via javascript.. I put a test <select> form that is not generated via js and it works goo.gl/cQxK6, but if you see the contact form in the footer, it doesn't work on that one (select form is hidden from the css that comes with the plugin)
[10:47:43] <zfly9> ^ but you're able to see if you inspect the element that the <select> is still intact and the plugin didn't change it
[10:58:31] <fonko> guys is it possible to remove html that has been appended previously with .html() ?
[10:59:08] <jrajav> You want to remove all of the element's contents or specifically what was appended with .html()?

[11:05:26] <ezrafree> hello
[11:05:57] <ezrafree> i am trying to validate a field for octal numbers, so each numbver should be 0-7, is there any way to do this?
[11:10:05] <fonko> jrajav, yes, only what i appended previously with .html
[11:11:17] <jrajav> Then no. It would be simpler to append a new element and retain a reference to that element
[11:11:44] <jrajav> You could probably kludge up a hack by regex'ing out the previous content, but I would recommend against that
[11:12:05] <NoiseEee> ezrafree: uh, check each field for a number between 0 and 7?
[11:14:35] <koopajah> Does someone know/uses dhtmlx around here?
[11:15:01] <fonko> jrajav, what i need to do is... as long as the user is typing in a field, show a gif. When he goes to other field that image is gone
[11:18:17] <fonko> also how do i trigger some function only if i have two events (click and focus) ?
[11:18:24] <NoiseEee> koopajah: what?
[11:19:38] <jrajav> fonko: Definitely make a real element. If you're appending an img tag, use $('<img/>'), which will synthesize a new img element that you can append to anything.
[11:19:59] <jrajav> fonko: And you can set .attr(src, 'myimageurl'), and obviously do anything else with jquery
[11:20:01] <ezrafree> NoiseEee: yes, i am wondering how i could do that in the jquery validation plugin
[11:20:12] <jrajav> fonko: Not sure what you mean by your second question
[11:20:23] <NoiseEee> ezrafree: no idea, but thats something you can validate on your own
[11:20:25] <fonko> jrajav, awesome thanks
[11:20:33] <fonko> something like .bind('keyup keypress blur change'
[11:20:40] <fonko> in order to show that image (loading gif)
[11:21:41] <fonko> by now im appending html img to a span like this $(span).html(img tag)
[11:22:19] <fonko> to do it your way should i declare a var img = $('<img />').attr() ?
[11:22:56] <jrajav> Yes, and then use .append()
[11:23:45] <fonko> and then $(span).html(var) ?
[11:23:48] <jrajav> Actually, it doesn't matter that much how you append it; when you want to go to delete it later, select it with $('yourcontainingelement img')
[11:24:12] <jrajav> You could also set an id on the img when you make it, to make a more specific selector
[11:24:20] <jrajav> I assume you already have a way to select the containing element
[11:24:27] <fonko> yup
[11:24:28] <fonko> thats good
[11:24:53] <fonko> $('<img/>').attr(id = something)?
[11:25:32] <NoiseEee> fonko: or $("<img>",{id:'myID'})
[11:25:39] <jrajav> .attr('id', something)
[11:25:45] <jrajav> Or that
[11:25:52] <dblosevn> .prop
[11:25:59] <dblosevn> id is a property
[11:26:04] <fonko> ok, good
[11:26:06] <dblosevn> not an attrib
[11:27:00] <MistuhKurtz> I thought prop was for bool values
[11:27:33] <tipdbmp> Is there a way to rotate the text inside of input type=text ?
[11:27:42] <tipdbmp> Say, 90 deg?
[11:28:32] <paraita> Hi guys
[11:29:25] <paraita> I'm using jquery to build a step-by-step form where I have to use one input from step i-1 for step i
[11:29:28] <dblosevn> no its for propertys such as id, checked, disabled, selectedIndex, tagName, nodeName, nodeType, ownerDocument, defaultChecked
[11:30:24] <paraita> anyone used to jquery validate rules ?
[11:30:47] <MistuhKurtz> the docs say nothing about ID
[11:31:06] <NoiseEee> MistuhKurtz: its a *property*
[11:33:21] <MistuhKurtz> could you point me to somewhere that explains why then?
[11:33:44] <paraita> range: [1, 102 - parseInt($("#age").val())] doesn't seem to work
[11:33:49] <MistuhKurtz> because I'm still not convinced. ID is not something that can change back and forth like a property
[11:34:25] <dblosevn> MistuhKurtz: propertys are members that exist in the js object, attribs are  user defined
[11:34:49] <dblosevn> eg... <img myattrib="blah" />
[11:35:30] <MistuhKurtz> yeah ID is not a property.
[11:36:00] <nsanden> im using .ajax with .done() with an alert() inside .done(). my alert isnt firing though and there are no js errors and i can confirm im getting 200 response on the ajax post. any tips?
[11:36:08] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/3sUrL/
[11:36:10] <dblosevn> id is a userdefinied attribute... i think not
[11:36:13] <NoiseEee> nsanden: crystal ball... fuzzy
[11:36:20] <MrPunkin> is there an easy way to alter a single item of the data of an object without re-querying it, merging objects, and re-saving it?
[11:36:42] <MistuhKurtz> if ID was a prop then that wouldn't throw an exception dblosevn and NoiseEee
[11:37:00] <MistuhKurtz> ah god dammit
[11:37:09] <MistuhKurtz> why is jquery not the default library on jsfiddle...
[11:37:16] <dblosevn> MistuhKurtz: http://jsfiddle.net/3sUrL/1/
[11:37:21] <dblosevn> helps if you select jquery
[11:37:52] <dblosevn> as evidenced by Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'prop' of null
[11:38:45] <draginx> Anyone here know how to plot markings with flotJS for a date/time value?
[11:38:51] <dblosevn> so back to what i said attribs are user-defined props are defined by js spec

[11:40:56] <kristofers> Hi, i'm trying to center a div that is supposed to be like it's a popup but it's just a div
[11:41:01] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/2vaze/
[11:41:16] <kristofers> What happens on my site when i do this, is there's a delay between the load and when it actually get's centered
[11:42:45] <someprimetime> kristofers: so show() it in the callback and have it hidden prior to that?
[11:45:38] <kristofers> i already had it like that, but apparently i was missing a display: hidden...
[11:45:47] <kristofers> :)
[11:46:05] <someprimetime> bil`:  i don't know why you are comparing if any radio inputs are checked to an empty array?
[11:46:28] <bil`> someprimetime: because if none are checked the object returned should just an an empty array in query?
[11:46:36] <bil`> jquery*
[11:47:10] <bil`> i thought anytime there isn't a selector match its an empty array?
[11:47:22] <someprimetime> if ($(':radio').is(':checked')) { alert('radios are checked'); }
[11:48:01] <bil`> can i do -->  if (!$(':radio').is(':checked'))
[11:48:22] <someprimetime> yes but why not just do if ($(':radio').not(':checked')) at that point?
[11:48:33] <bil`> because i didn't know about not() :)
[12:02:09] <khaan> hi everybody - is there anyone so kind to help a total jquery n00b please? :) i have to merge two functions and i'm getting lost...
[12:04:25] <ezrafree> how can i split a string into its characters?
[12:05:21] <tipdbmp> str.split(//)?
[12:05:43] <ezrafree> tipdbmp: are you asking me or telling me?
[12:06:17] <tipdbmp> str.split(''), seems to actaully work =).
[12:07:07] <ezrafree> tipdbmp: ah ok thanks, for some reason i thought maybe split wouldn't work since i usually always see it with a delimiter used
[12:07:24] <tipdbmp> Although //, should've worked as well...
[12:07:40] <jita> How can i change the text 'Choose account type' using query in this code http://dpaste.org/Raw2n/ ?
[12:07:44] <ezrafree> hmm w3schools seems to disagree with you though
[12:07:52] <ezrafree> seperator: Optional. Specifies the character, or the regular expression, to use for splitting the string. If omitted, the entire string will be returned (an array with only one item)
[12:08:01] <jita> I cannot add span for it for some reason
[12:08:37] <ezrafree> oh i see, i have to use str.split("")
[12:08:52] <tipdbmp> Seems so, yes.
[12:09:21] <tipdbmp> But as I mentioned earlier str.split(//), should be valid as well =), but I get syntax errors  :P
[12:12:58] <jita> how can i get the markup of the query dom element?
[12:13:44] <zfly9> Hey guys I am using this jQuery plugin to customize the <select> option in a form... The only problem is, the form I am using is generated via javascript.. I put a test <select> form that is not generated via js and it works goo.gl/cQxK6, but if you see the contact form in the footer, it doesn't work on that one (select form is hidden from the css that comes with the plugin)
[12:13:54] <biberao> hi
[12:13:55] <zfly9> ^ but you're able to see if you inspect the element that the <select> is still intact and the plugin didn't change it
[12:15:10] <gates> I have a JQuery script that tabs information between 2 buttons (more or less, hide and reveals).. when a user clicks a button to change the content and then clicks one of the links within the content the page changes. If the user hits BACK it brings the user back to the page with the tabs, but its in the default state.
[12:15:22] <gates> How do I preserve the click state? I assume its through changing URLs?
[12:15:32] <gates> will that keep the state if a user clicks BACK in their browser?
[12:15:57] <biberao> hi
[12:17:27] <MistuhKurtz> gates, you can accomplish that with a hash
[12:17:49] <gates> MistuhKurtz: okay, i think the script already keeps track of the "State" so shouldn't be hard
[12:18:25] <MistuhKurtz> do some googling for 'ajax deep linking' gates
[12:18:34] <gates> thanks :)
[12:18:39] <MistuhKurtz> I really like the jQuery BBQ plugin when I need something robust
[12:19:09] <MistuhKurtz> often times tab plugins will have that support built in but sometimes not (like in the case of twitter bootstrap)
[12:19:22] <gates> so THATS the name of this practice :)
[12:19:28] <MistuhKurtz> yep :)
[12:19:28] <dblosevn> jita: $('selector').prop('outerHTML') maybe
[12:19:33] <gates> thanks MistuhKurtz
[12:20:06] <MistuhKurtz> gates, read up on jQuery BBQ, I'm not sure whether it's appropriate to use in your exact case but it's good to be familiar with
[12:20:24] <dblosevn> im hungry bbq sounds good
[12:20:45] <zfly9> no suggestions guys

[12:22:32] <jerkface03> I have the follwoing alert showing up the Firefox... fileName	http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.js lineNumber	477
[12:22:42] <jerkface03> Does anyone know what that might be attributed to?
[12:23:47] <dblosevn> jerkface03: errors in jquery.js usually arent a problem in jquery but a problem with arguments passed into method from your code
[12:24:16] <jerkface03> dblosevn: I think it may be me calling .listview("refresh")...
[12:24:21] <dblosevn> so i follow the stack trace down and see what the last call from your code was to determine the issue
[12:24:36] <jerkface03> Probably because the list I'm refreshing is on another page?
[12:24:49] <jerkface03> Firebug isn't showing me a stacktrace
[12:24:59] <dblosevn> youll have to set break on error
[12:25:04] <dblosevn> then follow the trace
[12:25:33] <jerkface03> Trying to find that option...
[12:25:33] <Caelum> is there a nice file upload helper you guys know of?
[12:25:34] <dblosevn> or i think in firebug its ``break on all errors`
[12:28:03] <slick-> Hi friends, how do i make it so this doesn''t wrap around the checkbox http://jsfiddle.net/uWS3n/
[12:28:56] <paraita> ok I managed to do it, I had to add my rule using validator.rule("add", ....) and bind it to my particular step
[12:32:52] <monokrome> Hello. Does anyone know why jQuery doesn't send the {"Accept": "application/javascript"} header by default when using jsonp?
[12:33:00] <monokrome> It just sends {"Accept": "*/*"}
[12:33:08] <monokrome> and the headers map can't be used to override it
[12:33:18] <zfly9> biberao hi
[12:34:17] <biberao> any of you guys could explain me if possible if theres a way to add flash banners or ads "on the fly" with ease?
[12:34:20] <biberao> 7window 290
[12:34:24] <biberao> oops sorry the window thing
[12:35:30] <jerkface03> This is so god damn frustrating
[12:35:42] <jerkface03> I just want to refresh a list on another page and it keeps giving me errors
[12:36:05] <monokrome> Oh, I guess you can't change the Accept header for JSONP? Does ths type=application/javascript attribute not change it?
[12:36:24] <dblosevn> jerkface03: on another page?
[12:37:38] <jerkface03> dblosevn: jquery mobile ui... I have 2 pages, each with a list. I'm on the first page and I try to call .listview() for hte list on the second page and it craps out
[12:38:30] <dblosevn> with both pages in the dom?
[12:38:49] <jerkface03> Yes. Both pages.
[12:39:06] <lathan> biberao, your question is a bit vague. answer: yes, but because it is so simple there are numerous ways to do it, so we would need to know how you are doing it to help
[12:39:06] <lathan> jerkface03, I don't suppose that 2nd page is on an other subdomain / domain / http/https protocol ?\
[12:39:06] <lathan> ?bot
[12:39:06] <lathan> jerkface03, I don't suppose there is an error log more specific then "it craps out" ?
[12:39:07] <lathan> ?bot
[12:39:07] <bot-t> ?bot-t
[12:39:07] <bot-t> ?bot-t
[12:39:43] <dblosevn> pretty sure the debugger said it crapped out
[12:39:49] <biberao> lathan: i just was looking for anything simple so can learn and in the future do it because i dont have any example yet
[12:39:52] <dblosevn> hate it when it tells me that
[12:40:19] <lathan> biberao, the possibilities are endless, what kind of thing?
[12:40:51] <lathan> dblosevn, $('#ad_left').html(flash_code);
[12:40:54] <biberao> lathan: tell me a possibility
[12:41:16] <lathan> biberao, are you talking about on page load? or switching through multiple?
[12:41:42] <biberao> both
[12:42:05] <lathan> assuming you have the embed code.....(I will refer to that as the variable embed_code)
[12:42:21] <lathan> biberao, $(function(){ $('#ad_left').html(embed_code); })
[12:42:22] <lathan> ;
[12:42:48] <lathan> for the switching...you'd have to do some kind of timer to know when to swap, but then you'd just set the html to be the next embed's code
[12:43:33] <biberao> lathan: so i can replace that code with ease or someplace where to add the new ads without changing that code?
[12:43:50] <lathan> biberao, pretty close
[12:44:24] <lathan> biberao, the stuff that changes is the selector of the container to put the flash in, and the actual html/embed tags that get put in the container
[12:44:38] <lathan> biberao, for me...the more complicated stuff is the embed code, I hate coming up with that on my own
[12:45:14] <biberao> lathan: any good place to read about that you just showed me?
[12:45:22] <biberao> any technique name or soemthing

[12:54:56] <zfly9> Hey guys I am using this jQuery plugin to customize the <select> option in a form... The only problem is, the form I am using is generated via javascript.. I put a test <select> form that is not generated via js and it works goo.gl/cQxK6, but if you see the contact form in the footer, it doesn't work on that one (select form is hidden from the css that comes with the plugin) but you're able to see if you inspect the element that the <se
[12:55:09] <zfly9> plugin didn't change it
[12:55:25] <lathan> zfly9, my first guess is that the plugin runs before the form is dynamically created
[12:55:36] <zfly9> I tried to get it to load last
[12:55:41] <zfly9> but didn't seem to work
[12:55:42] <lathan> can you verify that?
[12:55:44] <lathan> hm
[12:56:47] <lathan> zfly9, can you make a simple example of this that shows the problem, see ?fiddle
[12:56:48] <bot-t> zfly9, #12735 (SlideToggle causes text to shrink after it is closed/opened ... - Opened 2 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12735

[12:56:56] <ejo> Hi all... I could use a little help with the following line from the documentation of .off() :  "Handlers proxied by jQuery.proxy() or a similar mechanism will all have the same unique id (the proxy function), so passing proxied handlers to .off may remove more handlers than intended. In those situations it is better to attach and remove event handlers using namespaces."
[12:57:09] <zfly9> the contact form is just loaded via <script type='text/javascript' src='/wp-includes/js/contact.js'></script> and the plugin is loaded via $(window).load(function(){
[12:57:17] <ejo> The basic idea there makes sense to me, but I'm not clear enough on exactly what is meant by "attach and remove event handlers using namespaces."
[12:57:39] <zfly9> lathan ok I'll work on that, I did provide a live link tho
[12:57:43] <lathan> ejo, when you bind an event, you can add a "class" to it. called a namespace
[12:57:50] <lathan> zfly9, I see that page, and am not sure what is breaking
[12:58:10] <lathan> ejo, so .on('click.red')
[12:58:29] <lathan> ejo, then you can .off('click.red') and it will ignore .on('click.blue') or even .on('click')
[12:58:45] <gates> Which way is the CORRECT way to add a hastag to a URL?
[12:58:49] <gates> I keep finding differnt ways
[12:58:55] <ejo> lathan: ohh thank you. NOW i see the relevant paragraph in the docs for .on()
[12:58:58] <lathan> ejo all of those bindings are a click event, but they are in a different namespace so you can "search" for them
[12:59:18] <lathan> ?mdc location.hash @ gates
[12:59:21] <bot-t> gates, window.location - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.location
[12:59:44] <lathan> gates, try window.location.hash = '#newHashTag";
[13:00:04] <ejo> got it... I had read that before, long ago, but glossed over it somehow.  I suppose I wasn't ready to understand back then that jQuery would still know that a click event was still a click event when it was called anything other than literally "click" and nothing more.  Now I get it, just a part of how jQuery works.
[13:00:31] <ejo> lathan, thanks for the quick and thorough answer :)
[13:00:49] <lathan> ejo they designed the syntax so its like the class selector..... so its like the xml markup of .... <event type="click" namespace="red">
[13:00:56] <ejo> yup
[13:01:00] <lathan> ?np
[13:01:00] <bot-t> No Problem
[13:01:19] <ejo> makes sense now.  I guess a couple years ago I just didn't instantly swallow it when I read it
[13:01:20] <ejo> cool
[13:03:05] <biberao> lathan: can i ask for some other advises?
[13:03:33] <lathan> ?ask @ biberao
[13:03:33] <bot-t> biberao, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:03:40] <lathan> yep
[13:03:59] <biberao> its not really jquery related hehe
[13:04:41] <gates> lathan: that worked
[13:04:43] <gates> how can i unset it?
[13:04:49] <gates> setting equal to ='' doesnt seem to work
[13:05:02] <lathan> hm
[13:05:09] <lathan> gates, let me fiddle that
[13:05:09] <biberao> thats why i asked first
[13:06:39] <lathan> gates, from the chrome console, it clears all but the hashtag #
[13:06:45] <lathan> gates, are you wanting to remove that as well?
[13:07:07] <gates> i have it add it if state is set to 1 and remove if else
[13:07:13] <zfly9> lathan best I could do
[13:07:15] <zfly9> http://jsfiddle.net/Kk2Lc/
[13:07:21] <zfly9> but on the live site do I have it loading in proper order?
[13:07:27] <gates> lathan: yes remove the empty #
[13:08:15] <MrPunkin> I have a render function that runs on each popstate event and I'd like only the latest popstate render to run if you click the back button say 20 times. How would I accomplish this?
[13:09:14] <gates> lathan: as well as not reload the page
[13:09:28] <lathan> gates, looking
[13:11:27] <gates> lathan: yeah this is a wierd one
[13:11:33] <khaan> hi everybody. I am trying to change the opacity of other elements when hovering on a menu. The menu voices have the same class as the objects, so, when hovering on the menu, the other ones should fade as well. I was trying this but all the elements fade, with no distinction. $(".navbar li").hover(function() { $(".post").not($(this)).css("opacity","0.5"); }); can anyone help me?
[13:12:36] <lathan> gates, sounds like the browsers don't natively support that
[13:14:09] <gates> lathan: so it seems- back button seems to be the best idea
[13:14:19] <gates> question is, if the user lands on page with the hash, then what happens lol
[13:14:57] <lathan> if its a #.... that matches a <a name="..." > .... then it will jump to that anchor
[13:15:07] <lathan> gates, if its just # with nothing else it will stay at the top of the page
[13:15:23] <gates> well its not the jum
[13:15:33] <gates> jump, as i am using a "tabbed" system
[13:15:34] <lathan> its really not that bad
[13:16:07] <gates> well for analytics and tracking it might be seem as a differnt page, i need to check
[13:16:40] <lathan> gates, I've done something with that with HTML5 history with fallback on hash tag
[13:16:56] <gates> i assume GA does NOT track # because it was made for page scrolling
[13:17:24] <lathan> gates, I did an example just like this, see this page: http://www.andrews.edu/undergrad/academics/
[13:17:40] <biberao> lathan: you do php too?
[13:18:03] <lathan> gates, those are ajax tabs, however, GA tracks, and (if HTML5 browser) it uses pushstate so the browser just adds it to the history and changes the url WITHOUT a reload
[13:18:21] <gates> correct
[13:18:28] <lathan> view the source and look at the 2nd/3rd to last page of the source code
[13:18:39] <lathan> starts with var Histroy = window.History
[13:19:05] <lathan> gates, its History.js, so https://github.com/balupton/History.js/ might be more helpful
[13:19:18] <lathan> biberao, I try not to :P
[13:19:44] <gates> lathan:
[13:19:45] <gates> http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=174992
[13:20:37] <timwis> Hey, does anyone know how jQuery Mobile scrolls to the top of the page whenever you change the page?
[13:20:42] <timwis> can't seem to find it in the source
[13:21:35] <biberao> lathan: so how you develop your websites
[13:22:03] <lathan> biberao, perl
[13:22:26] <lathan> ?seen khaan
[13:22:27] <bot-t> lathan, Couldn't find "seen khaan" in jQuery Docs.
[13:22:31] <lathan> seen khaan
[13:22:34] <gates> lathan: it seems google accepts #! as indexable
[13:22:39] <gates> prob why Twitter does it
[13:22:53] <lathan> gates, if your only concern is indexing, then you can do that
[13:22:55] <Caelum> why would window.close() not work, maybe I have an error earlier in the function?
[13:23:17] <achunin> hi
[13:23:31] <biberao> lathan: for real?
[13:23:44] <lathan> gates, but you can stay old fashioned as well, put this code in your tabs.on('shown'):
[13:23:44] <lathan> try{
[13:23:45] <lathan> var pageTracker = _gat._getTrackerByName();
[13:23:45] <lathan> pageTracker._trackPageview(dir + new_url);
[13:23:45] <lathan> } catch(err){}
[13:23:50] * lathan ndos @ biberao
[13:24:12] <lathan> Caelum, window.close might only work if its a window that was opened by javascript
[13:24:24] <lathan> Caelum, I don't think javascript can close a window if the user created it
[13:24:55] <lathan> Caelum, nevermind, window.close should work. you probably have a bug somewhere
[13:24:56] <biberao> lathan: crazy hehe
[13:25:07] <zfly9> lathan anything for me or should I reask?
[13:25:14] <biberao> i wantde to do something cool with jquery
[13:25:18] <lathan> zfly9, weren't you maing a fiddle?
[13:25:25] <achunin> anyone ever experience chrome choppy slide animations?
[13:25:27] <zfly9> I gave it to you
[13:25:27] <lathan> jQuery does a lot of cool things
[13:25:33] <zfly9> http://jsfiddle.net/Kk2Lc/
[13:25:35] <lathan> zfly9, oh...can you re post...ty
[13:25:46] <zfly9> lathan ^
[13:25:53] <biberao> lathan: i need to learn js first
[13:28:20] <lathan> zfly9, the only problem I can see is that your select is visibility: hidden
[13:28:49] <lathan> (oh, and you don't need doc load in jsfiddle, on the top left it says "onLoad" meaning it already wraps it into the doc load block) @ gates
[13:28:53] <lathan> sorry gates
[13:28:57] <lathan> zfly9, ^^^^^^
[13:29:06] <gates> lol
[13:29:11] <gates> ive had that issue before actaully xD
[13:29:21] <lathan> doing too many conversations at once
[13:29:34] <lathan> I seem to be the only active person answering
[13:30:27] <zfly9> lathan, the problem that it's not showing isn't the issue
[13:30:37] <zfly9> it's that the plugin isn't hitting that <select>
[13:30:49] <lathan> it is hitting it
[13:30:55] <lathan> but its getting visibility: hidden
[13:31:05] <lathan> or I'm completely missing what the plugin is diong
[13:31:07] <lathan> *doing
[13:31:49] <lathan> oh...nvmind
[13:31:54] <lathan> I'm being dense
[13:32:03] <lathan> ok, I see the symptom
[13:32:36] <lathan> zfly9, look at this console output: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/Kk2Lc/1/
[13:32:42] <lathan> zfly9, $('.dk') is selecting nothing
[13:32:51] <lathan> zfly9, so its not the plugin's fault you are giving it nothing
[13:33:08] <lathan> you need to work on your contact.js working faster, or trigger an event to run when its done loading
[13:33:25] <lathan> so in contact.js when its done: $('body').triger('form_loaded')
[13:33:47] <lathan> then in the main page: $('body').on('form_loaded', function(){ $('.dk').dropkick() });
[13:33:49] <lathan> zfly9, ^^
[13:33:51] <lathan> or something like that
[13:33:58] <lathan> * can help
[13:36:13] <lathan> zfly9, you could do $('#page').on('load','form',function(){ $(this).find('.dk').dropkick() })
[13:36:25] <lathan> zfly9, then just create the form in contact.js and trigger a load on the form
[13:36:39] <TelFiRE> Hi, anything like superfish but that functions with a touch-based fallback on mobile?
[13:36:40] <zfly9> the contact.js has class="dk" on the <select>
[13:36:42] <lathan> zfly9, the load event will bubble up and get caught by the main page, and it will call dropkick
[13:36:50] <lathan> zfly9, correct
[13:37:09] <lathan> zfly9, you the contact.js needs to call a function or trigger an event saying when it is done creating the form
[13:37:11] <zfly9> so that line of code should fix it?
[13:37:16] <lathan> ish
[13:37:33] <lathan> zfly9, if not, it should be close
[13:37:45] <lathan> zfly9, do you understand what its doing though?
[13:38:16] <zfly9> do I use it within window onload or take that out as well?
[13:38:56] <lathan> zfly9, it doesn't matter, when you do .on(event,selector, function) it does event delegation, so the object doesn't have to be loaded yet, it will wait for events to come even on dynamic elements
[13:39:22] <lathan> zfly9, and btw...you have $(window).load and $(document).load all over....simplify that do $(function(){...})
[13:39:22] <lathan> ;
[13:39:36] <lathan> those 3 are all the same thing, but no reason to do different ones....
[13:39:44] <lathan> just makes it seem different when its not
[13:40:18] <zfly9> ok will do
[13:40:28] <zfly9> that code though made it so even my example doesn't work now
[13:40:55] <lathan> zfly9, that's because it needs contact.js to trigger a load on the form it creates
[13:41:06] <lathan> zfly9, I feel like you are wanting me to spoonfeed you a solution
[13:41:59] <zfly9> sorry very new to js and trying to learn by these things, I completely understand..
[13:42:10] <lathan> zfly9, do you control the contact.js? or is it a library someone else maintains?
[13:42:11] <zfly9> I appreciate your help though, thanks
[13:42:20] <zfly9> I control it
[13:42:28] <lathan> then at the end of "function createForm"
[13:42:44] <lathan> add $(mapcontact).trigger('load')
[13:43:13] <lathan> zfly9, that will create a custom event which you can bind a function to run when it get's that event
[13:44:26] <zfly9> done
[13:45:06] <lathan> zfly9, look at this example to see how triggering an event "connects" it to code that is binding to the same event: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/2j5sU/
[13:45:20] <lathan> the function says "this event just happened on this element"
[13:45:35] <lathan> and the ".on" line says "on this event, run this code"
[13:45:52] <lathan> so when a load event is triggered on a form, it will run that function
[13:46:03] <zfly9> ok awesome let me try it out thanks
[13:46:03] <lathan> ?events
[13:46:04] <bot-t> Docs: Events - These methods are used to register behaviors to take effect when the user interacts with the browser, and to further manipulate those registered behaviors. http://api.jquery.com/category/Events/
[13:46:59] <BillCriswell> Just spent 5 minutes wondering why my selected attribute on my input type radio wasn't working. =(
[13:47:12] <BillCriswell> One of those days.
[13:47:14] <lathan> 5 minute is nothing
[13:47:24] <lathan> try spending hours looking for an extra comma in IE
[13:47:38] <BillCriswell> At the end of the object I assume?
[13:48:05] <BillCriswell> I ran into that years ago, definitely stayed fresh in my mind haha.
[13:48:46] <khaan> hi guys: how do i scope the class of an object i'm hovering?
[13:48:47] <lathan> BillCriswell, but when your object is recursive.....and mixing objects and arrays....and indenting....it get's complicated
[13:48:56] <lathan> and IE doesn't even give the correct line numbner
[13:48:59] <lathan> yes khaan I can help
[13:49:12] <khaan> hi lathan :)
[13:49:14] <lathan> khaan, I was helping another and you logged off before I got to you
[13:49:14] <zfly9> lathan what was the //..... all about ? I know it's a comment but..
[13:49:22] <khaan> oh thank you :)
[13:49:37] <lathan> zfly9, just referring to your function createForm that actuall makes the form html
[13:49:52] <lathan> khaan, can you put this on on a fiddle?, see ?jsfiddle
[13:49:53] <bot-t> khaan, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[13:50:12] <khaan> lathan: pretty complicated but i can try :)
[13:50:26] <lathan> khaan, or just re-explain your original post
[13:50:43] <lathan> khaan, the idea of jsfiddle is to find the core of the problem in simple form....
[13:50:58] <zfly9> lathan, so I would put addLoadEvent(createForm); instead of that comment ya?
[13:51:21] <khaan> ok, so this is it. I have a menu; each voice of the menu has a class which is like category-[slug]; and the page has some elements whose class is the same category-[slug]
[13:51:23] <lathan> zfly9, no.....that was a placeholder for all the code you already have in createForm
[13:51:36] <khaan> i want to change the opacity of those posts when hovering on the menu
[13:51:51] <khaan> so i was using something like $(".nav li").hover(function() { $(".post").not($(this)).css("opacity","0.5"); });
[13:51:57] <lathan> zfly9, contact.js -> function createForm
[13:52:06] <khaan> actually if i do, all posts turn 50% down
[13:52:06] <zfly9> lathan ah ok in the function itself
[13:55:23] <biberao> bye and thanks
[13:57:06] <khaan> lathan: http://jsfiddle.net/bz3mu/
[13:58:17] <lathan> khaan, oh...obvious....because the post that corresponds to the li isn't the li
[13:58:33] <lathan> having the same class is not the same as being the exact same thing
[13:58:49] <khaan> i see. So is there any other way to do so?
[14:00:55] <zfly9> lathan, still no luck, if you're getting frustrated with me feel free to ignore me haha
[14:04:01] <sunbeam> Hi, I need to forward to a link, like location() in php
[14:04:07] <sunbeam> how can i best do this with jquery
[14:04:30] <lathan> sunbeam, not really jQuery: see ?mdc window.location
[14:04:32] <bot-t> sunbeam, window.location - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.location
[14:04:46] <monokrome> returns?...
[14:04:46] <lathan> sunbeam, just do window.location = "http://www.google.com";
[14:05:08] <khaan> lathan; any hint? :)
[14:05:35] <sunbeam> lathan: thanks, does this work cross browser?
[14:06:01] <sunbeam> how can I check whether a ul li a{} that was clicked is the most upper li a ?
[14:06:43] <zfly9> lathan getting "uncaught typeerror: Object [object Object] has no method 'children' in contact.js
[14:06:55] <monokrome> sunbeam: stop propagation.
[14:07:33] <sunbeam> propagation?
[14:07:35] <Krinkle> sunbeam: you may want to play a little safer and use window.location.href = 'http://....';
[14:07:41] <Krinkle> (note the .href part)
[14:08:38] <monokrome> window.location.assign('http://google.com')
[14:08:40] <Krinkle> Hm.. I see that Mozilla now recommends assigning to location directly
[14:08:51] <sunbeam> monokrome: ok thanks, why is this better
[14:09:14] <monokrome> Because it looks like you're calling a function, not setting some variable. Readability.
[14:09:21] <Krinkle> http://www.w3.org/TR/Window/
[14:09:34] <Krinkle> http://www.w3.org/TR/Window/#location
[14:09:46] <sunbeam> ok
[14:09:51] <sunbeam> thanks
[14:10:19] <sunbeam> jQuery("#side-navigation > ul > li > a").click(function() {}
[14:10:30] <sunbeam> how do I check if this clicked has children
[14:10:41] <sunbeam> i mean, i need to grab the first <a> IF it has children
[14:10:50] <MistuhKurtz> $(this).children().length
[14:11:11] <MistuhKurtz> will return 0 (evaluating to false) if there are no children
[14:11:33] <sunbeam> yes
[14:11:34] <RLa> what you do with it after grabbing?
[14:11:37] <sunbeam> i mean,
[14:11:41] <sunbeam> when it has children
[14:11:49] <sunbeam> I need the first child <a> that occurs
[14:11:53] <sunbeam> the href
[14:11:54] <sunbeam> of that
[14:11:54] <RLa> maybe you can combine it into a single expression containing n-th selector
[14:12:00] <sunbeam> sorry if i'm not clear
[14:12:21] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: do it in the function
[14:12:33] <NoiseEee> also, its 2012 and you're making new code.  use .on(), not .click()
[14:12:56] <MistuhKurtz> click is just fine imho
[14:12:56] <sunbeam> yea but how do I find the first
[14:13:22] <lathan> zfly9, are you using $().children()? has jQuery loaded by then?
[14:13:27] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: i'd suspect it would be the first thing in children()
[14:14:13] <lathan> khaan, I'm working on something...
[14:14:24] <danzik17> sunbeam: see ?first
[14:14:24] <bot-t> sunbeam, .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[14:14:34] <khaan> lathan: ok, i see :) any idea is welcome anyway
[14:14:43] <lathan> danzik17, no...I think sunbeam wants like highest in the tree
[14:15:21] <danzik17> lathan: that should be the .first() one.  pretty sure elements are sorted in document order in jquery result sets.
[14:15:21] <zfly9> lathan I'm using what you gave me
[14:15:47] <lathan> danzik17, possibly, but that just makes me cringe
[14:16:27] <ML74_> Could someone help me with a jQuery/Google problem? The site is http://sbinf.com/rscott. I know that Google won't see the individual pages as they're loaded in the one page. Any way around this?
[14:16:37] <danzik17> lathan: using the API per the documentation makes you cringe?  ouch.  that must hurt often :(
[14:16:48] <lathan> lol
[14:17:20] <lathan> danzik17, no...having that shaky of a constraint used
[14:17:25] <lathan> danzik17, it will wear off
[14:19:32] <sunbeam> danzik17: thakns
[14:21:48] <sunbeam> jQuery(this).find('ul li').length == 0
[14:21:52] <sunbeam> somehow this is not good
[14:22:16] <sunbeam> with this I search for ul li children of THIS (clicked <a>) right?
[14:22:16] <Caelum> does javascript throw an error if you call a function with more parameters than it is declared to take?
[14:22:31] <NoiseEee> Caelum: no
[14:22:37] <Caelum> NoiseEee: awesome, thank you
[14:24:58] <sunbeam> nvm i found my mistake
[14:28:42] <ML74_> Could someone help me with a jQuery/Google/WP problem? The site is http://sbinf.com/rscott. I know that Google won't see the individual pages as they're loaded in the one page. Any way around this?
[14:30:22] <jerkface03> I continously poll a server for items to display in a list in my jquery mobile page. Right now I'm deleting all the li items, and adding whatever the server gives me back in as li items.
[14:30:26] <jerkface03> Is there a better way to do this?
[14:30:27] <dblosevn> ML74: google will see all thoughs "pages" as one page as all of them exist on pageload
[14:30:56] <RLa> jerkface03, something websocket-based
[14:31:25] <dblosevn> i usually implement a push instead of polling
[14:31:30] <ML74_> dblosevn: i know, is there any way around this, but keeping the same functionality?
[14:31:39] <dblosevn> but even when polling i would return something like changed: false
[14:31:44] <RLa> jerkface03, i just worked on app combining jquery-mobile, knockoutjs and socket.io
[14:31:58] <dblosevn> and do nothing if changed is false
[14:32:34] <Jakobud> ML74_: http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=174992
[14:32:36] <jerkface03> I'm talking about the javascript-portion. Not the polling portion. Is it standard to just nuke the items in the list and put in there replacements? or is it faster to try the diff the two lists to see which items have to be removed/added?
[14:32:51] <jerkface03> standard practice*
[14:33:00] <sunbeam> does anyone see whats wrong here?>
[14:33:04] <RLa> jerkface03, it is, diff-based is too complex
[14:33:06] <sunbeam> jQuery(this).closest("li").find('ul li').first("a").attr("href")
[14:33:16] <RLa> jerkface03, but doable
[14:33:18] <dblosevn> let the server decide if anything has changed since the last poll if not return a response with stating to do nothing
[14:33:52] <RLa> yes, the server could stream changes too
[14:34:01] <dblosevn> return a datestamp with your response from the poll and send that datestamp to the server on the next poll
[14:34:16] <dblosevn> id worry about a websocket based mobile app
[14:34:41] <dblosevn> power options on the device could close the socket and not allow it to reopen again while on battery
[14:35:20] <dblosevn> polling is about the best solution for this and limiting the number of polls
[14:35:46] <dblosevn> as well as the size of the data returned when changes have been made
[14:36:00] <jerkface03> Also, 1 more question... is there a standard way to switch up the jquery list item style? For example, I want to have a single item with a red background (to signify an error with that item), I made a class for it and applied that class to my list item, but that red background doesn't show anymore as soon as I call listview('refresh')...
[14:36:19] <brainwarped> I'm using the code: .bind("select_node.jstree", function(e, data) and it works, but what does "e" do?
[14:36:37] <dblosevn> refresh rebuilds the listview, your class will need to be readded fter refresh

[14:38:05] <bot-t> lathan, Okay.
[14:38:19] <jerkface03> ugh
[14:38:21] <jerkface03> so much work...
[14:38:37] <lathan> bot-t: tell khaan this is close: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/KVTh2/
[14:38:38] <bot-t> lathan, Okay.
[14:38:57] <TelFiRE> Superfish is crap for mobile and I can't believe there's no solution for that on the first page of google
[14:39:41] <tom_anderson> I have a specification for a jQuery plugin I would like to share.  I welcome comments
[14:39:46] <tom_anderson> tagmanager-tomanderson.rhcloud.com/
[14:40:55] <paradoxquine> hey guys! I'm getting some xml from a server, parsing it, finding an <img> in it, and everything works -- but when i insert the img into the page, no request is made to the src url to actually get the image. Can anyone explain to me why this might be?
[14:45:37] <jerkface03> dblosevn: didn't really work.
[14:45:54] <jerkface03> Some CSS styles get picked up, like border-color, but others don't, like background-color
[14:46:53] <syskk> I'd like to implement a button like Twitter "Following" (when you mouseover it says Unfollow). was wondering what would be the best way to implement this with jquery.. is there a "toggle" for mouseovers?
[14:47:54] <tom_anderson> syskk: hover
[14:49:03] <syskk> tom_anderson: thanks
[14:51:10] <TelFiRE> Need to make my superfish menu close up when a link is clicked (these are hash links so you're not leaving page). Is there a command to be called or Idk something I can do to make this menu work in mobile? On the verge of custom coding a drop down menu that works differently for mobile and desktop
[14:54:29] <jedimind> TelFiRE, noone uses superfish / suckerfish any more
[14:54:30] <jedimind> ever
[14:54:35] <jedimind> you dont need javascript for a dropdown men
[14:54:36] <jedimind> u
[14:54:53] <tw2113> did you ever?
[14:55:00] <TelFiRE> you do for one that works in old browsers and doesn't look like crap
[14:55:13] <jedimind> you shouldnt be supporting ie6 any more
[14:55:26] <tw2113> put IE7 on the backburner too
[14:55:26] <jedimind> ie7 and up support :hover on any element
[14:55:35] <jedimind> therefore you would only need js for ie6
[14:55:36] <TelFiRE> You know what I hate
[14:55:40] <jedimind> jesus?
[14:55:45] <TelFiRE> How I come here seeking a solution and people just pile new problems onto me
[14:55:47] <tw2113> pompous assholes?
[14:55:50] <jedimind> midgets on bicycles
[14:56:08] <jedimind> TelFiRE, sorry for recommending an approach that requires less effort an dwork
[14:56:08] <_zoggy_> superfish/suckerfish w/hoverintent is still quite used
[14:56:12] <jedimind> and *gasp* makes you build shit properly
[14:56:15] <_zoggy_> not everyone has dropped legacy ie support
[14:56:21] <jedimind> ill hold back next time you spoon feeding twat
[14:56:33] <jedimind> _zoggy_, no but they should
[14:56:49] <devone> can anyone help with this please? been cracking my brain for hrs http://jsfiddle.net/BNyLz/
[14:56:52] <jedimind> and on that note im stepping away, i seem to be a little worked up
[14:56:58] <_zoggy_> i would agree. but if you dev for corp sometimes your stuck using ie only becaues of active-x crap
[14:57:08] <_zoggy_> or if your in china.. you may not have a choice
[14:57:28] <brainwarped> I'm having trouble getting django-filter, https://django-filter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html to do some dynamic rendering: http://dpaste.org/cTmLE/ what would I need to put in the URL and data to get this thing to work?
[14:57:29] <jedimind> or north korea
[14:57:37] <jedimind> where you get jail time if you dont develop for ie5.5+
[14:57:45] <jedimind> true story
[14:57:56] <dblosevn> guess id be in jail then lmao
[14:58:07] <TelFiRE> jedimind: there is _NO_ pure css way to do a proper dropdown menu. Sorry
[14:58:09] <dblosevn> i wont dev for anything better then latest -2
[14:58:13] <jedimind> TelFiRE, ....
[14:58:15] <jedimind> okay then
[14:58:17] <systemfault> lol
[14:58:25] <_zoggy_> there are plenty of css only menus
[14:58:27] <TelFiRE> Tell me how that's going to work on an android
[14:58:27] <systemfault> I can do it!
[14:58:28] * tw2113 has done many pure css/list menus
[14:58:32] <TelFiRE> actually you don't have to. I will. Not at all.
[14:58:40] <jedimind> why in the fuck would you have a dropdown menu on a mobil device?
[14:58:45] <tw2113> not on mobile though
[14:58:48] <tw2113> i'll confess to that
[14:58:49] <jedimind> thats the worst idea ive heard since cancer
[14:58:51] <_zoggy_> you just have to have a browser that css3/html5 support
[14:58:55] <dblosevn> lmao tell me how that works out for you
[14:59:04] <devone> http://jsfiddle.net/BNyLz/1/
[14:59:05] <TelFiRE> and you can ignore IE6 all you want, in fact I applaud you for it, but you're going to lose customers and I am not.
[14:59:05] <TelFiRE> 
[14:59:12] <jedimind> *nod*
[14:59:15] <systemfault> ...
[14:59:19] <systemfault> Le stupid.
[14:59:22] * jedimind steps away slowly
[14:59:23] <tw2113> hold on
[14:59:24] * jmerlin pours butter on his popcorn
[14:59:37] <tw2113> TelFiRE, is trying to use suckerfish on mobile?how is IE an issue?
[14:59:49] <jedimind> shhh it doesnt need to make sense
[14:59:53] <TelFiRE> tw2113: he told me to NOT use superfish
[14:59:55] <jedimind> the problem is we need to just fix his fucking problems
[14:59:56] <TelFiRE> to use pure css
[14:59:59] <brainwarped> I put a dropdown menu on mobile... it was not pretty.
[15:00:01] <jedimind> and not really try to discuss better approaches
[15:00:05] <jedimind> because, apparently, he pays us for this shit
[15:00:14] <devone> TelFiRE why do you think there's not a proper way to do a css only drop down? you counting old browser rendering or something?
[15:00:15] <tw2113> i was on mobile once
[15:00:16] <dblosevn> TelFiRE: my customers thank me for keeping them ahead of time in technology, and writing cleaner code that requires far less maintnance, and in turn gets me more work and higher pay
[15:00:41] <_zoggy_> dropdowns on mobile are fine. just have to be mindful that you need to change your trigger mech from hover to click/touch depending on if its a touch device or not (modernizer)
[15:00:47] <jedimind> dblosevn, who needs cleaner code and portability and lower develompent costs, when you need to accomodate the 0.7% of people using ie6
[15:00:52] <jedimind> thats OBVIOUSLY the higher focus
[15:00:58] <_zoggy_> and for touch you just have to be careful with clicks bubbling up
[15:01:21] <TelFiRE> jedimind: seriously, you are in here all the time bitching people out for asking for help and then they get assholes who want them to completely redo their project because they don't agree with every decision I made on it. don't act like I"m the one in here being a dick. I did not ask for a best practices discussion, I asked for jQuery help getting something to work as expected.
[15:01:21] <MugginsM> my customers don't get to choose which browser they use, and they appreciate that my apps work for them
[15:01:25] <jedimind> _zoggy_, taking away from native device behaviour and offering up dropdowns is cumbersome at best
[15:01:29] <dblosevn> jedimind: exactly my point im not going to bloat my code with support for a dead browser that ms even refuses to support anymore
[15:01:54] <TelFiRE> I didn't even ask about IE support
[15:01:57] <TelFiRE> YOU GUYS devolved this into that
[15:02:03] <jedimind> lol
[15:02:09] <jedimind> you're amusing
[15:02:13] <jedimind> im going for a cigarette
[15:02:19] <dblosevn> ya because ie6 is the only reason in the world youd be using superblowfish
[15:02:25] <dblosevn> lmao
[15:02:26] <jedimind> someone help me waste his time and fix his ridiculous plugin please
[15:02:27] <jedimind> so he can stfu
[15:02:29] <brainwarped> no ideas on django-filter?
[15:02:41] <brainwarped> gotta wait for apollo to get back
[15:02:52] <jedimind> brainwarped, what was the question, i think it got a little lost in the flaming
[15:02:59] <dblosevn> :-D
[15:03:00] <brainwarped> I'm having trouble getting django-filter, https://django-filter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html to do some dynamic rendering: http://dpaste.org/cTmLE/ what would I need to put in the URL and data to get this thing to work?
[15:03:18] <TelFiRE> It is so not fair. I come in here I ask for help with one thing, you guys go off on crazy unrelated tangents and act like I"m being a dick when I try to steer it back on course. I don't expect free help but I do expect you to not be a dick. If you don't want to help then don't hang out in a support channel. Trolling people isn't helpful and I should not be expected to grovel at your feet when all you've done is insult me
[15:03:21] <brainwarped> I have a bind that is calling that code... so it all runs
[15:03:29] <jedimind> lol
[15:03:39] <jedimind> i think he's mad
[15:04:01] <tom_anderson> say it in yoda talk or it doesn't count jedimind
[15:04:10] <dblosevn> and that much closer to solving his problem
[15:04:15] <jedimind> i didnt intend to troll him at all, but really, are we here to spoon feed; or to promote best usage and implementation
[15:04:48] <tom_anderson> shouldn't that include promoting adoption (adopters)?
[15:05:14] <s5fs> jedimind: well, not all of us are able to dictate which browers our applications need to support.
[15:05:15] <brainwarped> TelFiRE: I think you should definitely do custom css with the @media that works differently for mobile than desktop...
[15:05:17] <dblosevn> i want to adopt a bear
[15:05:23] <jedimind> s5fs, thats entirely fair
[15:05:39] <jedimind> s5fs, and there are still better methods to accomodate that
[15:05:56] <jedimind> but he got so worked up and demanding that we fix his fucking problem and i was just asking why instead of blindly doing it
[15:06:02] <jedimind> and then he got worked up and rage quit
[15:06:11] <jedimind> and fairly certain punched a hole in a wall
[15:06:15] <brainwarped> oh no, I'm too late, he quit
[15:06:15] <s5fs> understandable, the channel kinda turned on him
[15:06:27] <dblosevn> lol @ ragequit wasnt aware we were playing mw3
[15:06:28] <brainwarped> haha
[15:06:31] <hugo_moss> can someone help me with this...ive been banging my head on this for hours.  im trying to fadein my webpage once all the background-images, img tag images, font-face files, have been loaded. i prefetch all these resources, and then do a fadein, but for some reason it has trouble loading the last few images, and the fadein of the page is real choppy. can someone help? im using google web font
[15:06:31] <hugo_moss> loader for the fonts, the page is http://edtcorp.net16.net
[15:06:45] <jedimind> hugo_moss, if youre banging your head against a wall already, this channel probably wont help
[15:06:45] <jedimind> :)
[15:07:06] <hugo_moss> hehe
[15:07:08] <tom_anderson> hugo_moss that's a good idea.  Can you show a Google page which uses the same strategy?
[15:07:14] <achunin> Does anyone know if having a position:static <embed> element in the DOM will cause choppy javascript animations in Chrome?
[15:07:34] <jedimind> hugo_moss, are you using document.load
[15:07:54] <hugo_moss> yeah tom_anderson, there is only one page that i know does it, but some of the images arent preloaded, go to www.nokia.com
[15:07:58] <jedimind> also i wouldnt recommend this method, because your page is invisible
[15:08:00] <brainwarped> any ideas on the django filter problem?
[15:08:10] <hugo_moss> and if its the first time you visit the page, it loads two or three images, then fades in the rest
[15:08:40] <hugo_moss> jedimind, im using window.load
[15:08:50] <hugo_moss> i tried jqueries load function
[15:09:16] <hugo_moss> when you go to the page, is it choppy as well? for me, it works perfect in internet explorer
[15:09:22] <hugo_moss> the way that i want the effect to happen
[15:09:27] <hugo_moss> but chrome safari, not
[15:09:44] <brainwarped> I'm definitely just missing something with respect to the relationship between the view and the templtae.
[15:10:28] <brainwarped> also, I'd be happy to NOT use ajax if it helps
[15:10:55] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: wasnt choppy at all for me, in chrome said loading then faded out and the page appeared
[15:11:12] <brainwarped> choppy is usually just a problem with your computer...
[15:11:19] <hugo_moss> weird
[15:11:30] <hugo_moss> what browser you using dblosevn?
[15:11:40] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: did the same in ie10
[15:11:47] <dblosevn> chrome latest
[15:11:54] <dblosevn> my computer is a beast tho
[15:11:57] <brainwarped> hugo_moss: try resetting your browser (removing cache and cookies and everything)
[15:11:59] <tom_anderson> Nokia is a deveoping website.  Not a google property I believe
[15:12:37] <dblosevn> chrome Version 23.0.1271.64 m
[15:12:52] <brainwarped> is my problem request.GET?
[15:13:12] <TelFiRE> Look guys you are preaching to the choir in terms of using a CSS-based solution whenever possible. It is in this case, not possible, and I am exasperated. I would really, really appreciate anyone who would be able to point me in the right direction, best practice or not, to make superfish work reliably on mobile. I know it's a terrible navigation structure for a mobile web page, but it is what it is. I would like superfish to work like it normally does, rig
[15:13:13] <TelFiRE> of the box on iOS, but for Android as well, and to work even if I am going to a hash tag link. Right now, since I"m going to a hash tag link, the page is not reloading, so the drop-down doesn't roll back up ever.
[15:13:21] <hugo_moss> dblo, the fadein of the page was a smooth transition?
[15:13:59] <chrisbolton> Looking for a little help. I'm using Rails to pass a parameter to a new page then use jQuery to see if the parameter was passed. If it was then do something, just not sure how to select a parameter using jQuery.
[15:14:18] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: yes
[15:14:21] <achunin> @hugo_moss - i got a smooth fadeIN
[15:14:39] <brainwarped> TelFiRE: i don't know what superfish is... I suggested css because its the only way I know.
[15:14:53] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: honestly looked better then nokias lmao
[15:14:57] <jedimind> TelFiRE, looking at their site for roughly 3 seconds, i see that they have a onHide method
[15:15:01] <hugo_moss> i still get fout
[15:15:03] <hugo_moss> i get a flash
[15:15:09] <jedimind> or onShow
[15:15:15] <hugo_moss> the whole page isnt faded in, first it fades in the top section
[15:15:15] <jedimind> or a number of callbacks
[15:15:16] <TelFiRE> brainwarped: well, I know you can have the thing come down using a :hover and even get the animation with css transitions. I love all that but the client is very picky! It needs to animate in all browsers
[15:15:19] <hugo_moss> then the bottom
[15:15:50] <hugo_moss> for some reason they fadein separately
[15:15:51] <achunin> tell the client you want a chocolate cake that helps you lose weight
[15:16:03] <TelFiRE> hmmm jedimind where are you seeing this? I looked around for such functions quite a while on the superfish website
[15:16:16] <jedimind> http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/#options
[15:16:28] <Heather_> could someone help me with this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13350022/best-way-to-declare-and-collect-data
[15:16:40] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: cant see that problem and your entire page fits on my monitor
[15:16:59] <jedimind> you can also probably create a custom click event on every anchor inside that which triggers a show/hide state of superfis
[15:16:59] <jedimind> h
[15:17:28] <jedimind> or simply $('nav a').click(function() { this.parents('ul:first-child').hide() }
[15:17:42] <BinaryKitten> Hi. I need to figure out how to wait for 2 things to happen before doing a 3rd. 1 is an ajax call response, the 2nd is a response on a comet style live feed
[15:17:44] <hugo_moss> when i refresh, on the second page load because everything is cached, it fadesin nicely for me
[15:17:53] <jedimind> .parents('ul').eq(0).hide() alternatively
[15:18:02] <TelFiRE> oooh you pass it as an argument
[15:18:04] <BinaryKitten> i believe i need to use deffered/when etc but not sure how to impement it
[15:18:06] <TelFiRE> I was looking for a callback
[15:18:12] <TelFiRE> or rather option
[15:18:48] <chrisbolton> Looking for a little help. I'm using Rails to pass a parameter to a new page then use jQuery to see if the parameter was passed. If it was then do something, just not sure how to select a parameter using jQuery.
[15:18:48] <coldhead> ?when @ BinaryKitten
[15:18:48] <bot-t> BinaryKitten, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[15:19:02] <dblosevn> $(this).closest not this.parents
[15:19:11] <BinaryKitten> coldhead yeah i know about when
[15:19:13] <dblosevn> this is not a jqobj
[15:19:31] <coldhead> and the AJAX is already a deferred
[15:19:33] <BinaryKitten> coldhead the part i'm having trouble with is the 2nd feed
[15:19:37] <coldhead> right
[15:19:51] <BinaryKitten> since that is ongoing since the start of the page load
[15:20:04] <coldhead> ahh interesting
[15:20:20] <coldhead> you might have to poll for it inside a deferred
[15:20:25] <jedimind> that was fun
[15:20:28] <coldhead> and resolve() when whatever condition you want is met
[15:20:30] <BinaryKitten> so i send a request along a channel, and the response is returned in the feed
[15:21:02] <BinaryKitten> which is outside the scope for the ajax request which is where i'm getting lost lol
[15:21:34] <coldhead> yes it's slipping through the nets of my mind too BK
[15:21:46] <coldhead> i've only ever when()ed regular ol' ajax
[15:21:54] <BinaryKitten> yep. same here
[15:21:58] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: duracell makes condoms?
[15:22:11] <dblosevn> whers energizer lmao
[15:22:29] <BinaryKitten> ok lets just change focus a little. lets say it's "and the user has clicked the right button" instead of the feed
[15:22:37] <BinaryKitten> same principle
[15:23:31] <hugo_moss> haha, im still testing stuff
[15:25:47] <coldhead> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/HM6F6/
[15:26:05] <coldhead> but i guess you mean without a click()
[15:26:15] <coldhead> something less evented
[15:26:35] <BinaryKitten> well the feed is just 1 long event handler
[15:27:01] <BinaryKitten> the issue now is tying the data from the ajax request to the data in the feed
[15:27:16] <BinaryKitten> they are linked but since there is no context it's hard to marry them up
[15:27:32] <coldhead> gnarf was a darling in helping me do that once
[15:27:53] <coldhead> but the data was isomorphic, just multiple calls to the same source
[15:28:21] <BinaryKitten> basically i have a list of content ids, i have to load json files based on those ids. Once those files are loaded, i need to pass the ids through to a license service which returns the results on the aforementioned feed
[15:28:39] <chrisbolton> Looking for a little help. I'm using Rails to pass a parameter to a new page then use jQuery to see if the parameter was passed. If it was then do something, just not sure how to select a parameter using jQuery.
[15:28:48] <BinaryKitten> once that has happened and we get their validity, we can then render the contents out
[15:29:04] <biberao> hi
[15:29:33] <coldhead> that sounds terrible, BinaryKitten
[15:29:37] <coldhead> i would be afraid to try
[15:29:41] <BinaryKitten> coldhead heh
[15:29:46] <BinaryKitten> i've managed the rest of it
[15:30:13] <BinaryKitten> worst part is that we can't even associate context other than the ids
[15:30:26] <goddard> can i use tooltips in jquery 1.5 ? or is there a way to wrap my jquery so it doesn't mess with old jquery?
[15:30:53] <BinaryKitten> so we send a request with the ids, we get back (in the feed) [{id: xxxx, valid:true},{id:yyyy, valid: false}]
[15:32:02] <BinaryKitten> coldhead this site/app/thing has been driving me mad for the last 2 weeks
[15:32:12] <BinaryKitten> this is just the latest "feature" it "requires"
[15:32:36] <Denver_> how can i make drag and drop work on mobile? I have it done with jquery-ui draggable now for desktop
[15:33:02] <hugo_moss> ok i got it
[15:33:06] <hugo_moss> thanks guys for your help
[15:34:22] <coldhead> BinaryKitten: it will be nice once it's done and you can close off all the scary internals!
[15:34:32] <coldhead> until then: the horror
[15:35:28] <Denver_> mobile drag and drop. how do I start?
[15:36:00] <BinaryKitten> coldhead if i bind an event to a function var, then change that function var will it trigger the new function or the old?
[15:36:49] <coldhead> i would expect the new
[15:36:58] <da-beginner> hi.. quick question regarding my sample at http://scrypton.com.au/backbone/cellar/desktop/
[15:37:01] <da-beginner> can someone tell me the best way to 'scroll' the wine list to show the currently selected wine after it has been added and/or sorted?
[15:37:03] <coldhead> but it's definitely a see ?tias
[15:37:04] <bot-t> Try It And See
[15:37:13] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery, BK
[15:37:38] <BinaryKitten> heh
[15:37:45] <biberao> whats the best way to feed text to a push box
[15:37:48] <BinaryKitten> same here coldhead, though i think you have a few more hours on me
[15:43:04] <BinaryKitten> coldhead, i'll figure it out
[15:43:11] <BinaryKitten> (afterall i have to lol)
[15:43:22] <coldhead> you sure do, i am useless
[15:43:34] <coldhead> would love to see what you come up with BK
[15:43:44] <coldhead> and steal it for my own use later and take all the credit
[15:43:45] <coldhead> thx
[15:45:09] <BinaryKitten> coldhead.. hmm
[15:45:19] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/wEtF3/
[15:46:04] <Caelum> if I'm using the form plugin and .ajaxForm, how do I also hook a validation function to the form?
[15:47:28] <BinaryKitten> coldhead i think i have it :D
[15:47:30] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/wEtF3/1/
[15:48:22] <coldhead> ow, this is contorting my brains
[15:49:09] <Caelum> oh I see, I make a .submit callback and use .ajaxSubmit in it
[15:49:55] <BinaryKitten> coldhead: for the final twist... http://jsfiddle.net/wEtF3/2/
[15:50:38] <BinaryKitten> so very much thank you coldhead
[15:50:57] <BinaryKitten> i now have my link :D
[15:51:19] <coldhead> that's really beautiful, BinaryKitten
[15:51:32] <BinaryKitten> and completely batshit insane
[15:51:35] <coldhead> hahahah
[15:51:38] <coldhead> that's the appeal!
[15:51:50] <BinaryKitten> i'll let you know tomorrow how it goes
[15:52:35] <coldhead> if you survive
[15:52:39] <coldhead> GOOD LUCK BK
[15:52:41] <Guest95126> guys, I have the following fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/wZawD/  for whatever reason, I cannot get it to hide/show the hidden input onclick.  any help would be greatly appreciated
[15:52:53] <coldhead> those are the kinds of nested deferred functions that can swallow minds
[15:53:46] <BinaryKitten> yep luckily one will be a simple ajax request
[15:54:09] <Guest95126> coldhead:  any ideas?
[15:54:13] <coldhead> so casual, so flippant
[15:54:27] <coldhead> Guest95126: i have ideas about killing everyone in the office and moving to Mars
[15:54:34] <coldhead> that's not what you're after though is it
[15:54:40] <BinaryKitten> anyway... i'm gonna take my warped brain and email myself that snippet
[15:54:46] <timwis> Hey guys, anyone know of a good library for a nested (multi-level) pie chart? Somehow google isn't finding anything
[15:54:52] <timwis> Or perhaps a more common name for such a thing?
[15:54:58] <BinaryKitten> coldhead <in Arnie voice> Get ya ass t' mars!
[15:55:12] <Guest95126> coldhead:  I mean in regards to my fiddle
[15:58:05] <coldhead> Guest95126: you have all these spaces in your HTML
[15:58:09] <coldhead> class = "some class"
[15:58:15] <coldhead> won't do anything in HTML
[15:58:20] <coldhead> class="some class"
[15:58:38] <coldhead> i fixed the spacing for an element and it worked
[15:58:48] <coldhead> it's very sad
[16:00:04] <Guest95126> coldhead: which classes have spaces in them?  I was pretty sure they were all one word classes
[16:00:14] <coldhead> no the html
[16:00:22] <coldhead> class = "thisdoesntwork"
[16:00:24] <coldhead> vs
[16:00:27] <coldhead> class="thisdoeswork"
[16:04:36] <_zoggy_> 'some class' = two classes.. 'some' and 'class'
[16:05:07] <coldhead> a class called class is very gomfusing
[16:05:54] <recurse> $(".prodListingTable").load(path + '?cols=3 .prodListingTable', function() {        ........ Passing URL var to a page, returns the entire page, and using that selector filters all but the element contents i select - but it also loads in all the javascript and other includes again, doesnt it?
[16:06:06] <recurse> http://pastebin.com/R9HeLRnN
[16:06:11] <Guest95126> coldhead, can you save what you changed, and save/send me the link, b/c I just changed all classes tyo what you said, and the first alert still comes back as undefined
[16:07:04] <coldhead> Guest95126: http://jsfiddle.net/wZawD/1/
[16:07:24] <recurse> what im basically trying to do is reload a section of the same page with a url var passed to the page (this url var changes my td count of a table)
[16:07:35] <coldhead> Guest95126: forget the alert(), i have used nextAll to make it happy and it seems to work
[16:07:51] <recurse> willing to pay for a solution at this point
[16:08:07] <coldhead> it won't load the JS
[16:08:16] <coldhead> jQuery strips <script> tags out
[16:08:20] <coldhead> it might reload the CSS
[16:08:23] <coldhead> but if they're cached
[16:08:30] <coldhead> no problemo
[16:09:28] <Guest95126> coldhead:  what does the :first do?? I tried next() and nextall to no avail, LOL
[16:10:29] <recurse> http://www.zwavemart.com/Zwave-Controllers/Zwave-Remotes.html ... mouse over any product .. youll see a QuickLook button - click (pop works) ... now try to sort the listings (upper right says display and has sort icons) .. now click the QuickLook icon again - the contents inside dont load any longer - no errors and my console gives me all green lights .. i see the html in my console returned...
[16:10:31] <recurse> ...but the contents dont update AFTER sort
[16:10:45] <Guest95126> coldhead:  tnx
[16:11:19] <recurse> i suspect its due to the way im loading in that div contents
[16:11:53] <recurse> will pay for a fix
[16:12:13] <coldhead> ?:first @ Guest95126
[16:12:14] <bot-t> Guest95126, :first: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[16:12:33] <coldhead> that stops it showing ALL those fields
[16:14:35] <recurse> maybe i went about this wrong.
[16:15:48] <recurse> coldhead, care to take a crack at it?
[16:16:29] <Guest95126> coldhead:  in that same scenario, how can I reset the val to empty when it's not checked?  I tried this:  $(this).parent().nextAll('.hcpother:first').val('');  but it does nothing
[16:16:42] <Guest95126> .hcpother is the class of the input
[16:19:10] <coldhead> Guest95126: removeAttr('checked')
[16:19:21] <coldhead> i am looking recurse
[16:19:27] <coldhead> where is the code that does the quick look?
[16:19:34] <Guest95126> coldhead:  I mean from the input that is being hidden/shown
[16:19:48] <recurse> (digging)
[16:20:16] <coldhead> Guest95126: you probably need more idea of what you're doing
[16:20:29] <coldhead> i suspect you want to use find() as well as or instead of nextAll()
[16:20:33] <coldhead> ?find @ Guest95126
[16:20:33] <bot-t> Guest95126, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[16:20:45] <coldhead> you'll have to figure out exactly how to walk the DOM
[16:21:33] <recurse>  /js/blocks/blk_box_ajax_popup.js
[16:21:36] <Guest95126> coldhead:  $(this).parent().nextAll('.hcpother:first').val();  this is basically what you were doing to hide, I'm just using the class of the input to try to reset it value to empty/nothing
[16:22:16] <recurse> http://www.zwavemart.com/js/blocks/blk_box_ajax_popup.js
[16:23:53] <coldhead> this is prototype, recurse :(
[16:23:57] <coldhead> not a language i speak
[16:24:03] <recurse> yes ... but ..
[16:24:35] <recurse> the code works
[16:24:48] <recurse> its just when using jquery to load() in that div again
[16:24:57] <recurse> it breaks ...
[16:25:08] <recurse> you say load() strips <script>
[16:25:17] <recurse>  /js/blocks/blk_box_ajax_popup.js is included on every load
[16:25:27] <recurse> so perhaps load() isnt the best approach
[16:25:45] <recurse> if you see what im doing, im simply trying to pass the page a get var
[16:25:51] <recurse> without refreeshing
[16:26:12] <recurse> this get var passes an argument to php to parse the table's td count
[16:26:48] <coldhead> recurse: it might be related to your use of onclick=
[16:27:00] <coldhead> it's better to use JS event handling
[16:27:01] <danmichel> I added $('#home_conta').load(<?php "'" . get_template_directory() . '/loop-slideshow.php' . " #featured'" ?>); to my test site, http://theplural.com/ but I'm not sure if it's working because the site loads instantly for me, as it's my home server. basically trying to load what's in that div asynchronously  . the site is loading the same as my live site http://varmag.com/ . From what i understand, .load should make the slider load asynchron
[16:27:05] <coldhead> ?on
[16:27:05] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:27:07] <coldhead> or
[16:27:09] <coldhead> ?live
[16:27:10] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[16:28:47] <coldhead> recurse: where is this code defined: ajaxPopup_3.show(event);
[16:30:09] <recurse> the _(int) part of that is added dynamically by php, but for the most part its located inside http://www.zwavemart.com/js/blocks/blk_box_ajax_popup.js i believe
[16:30:12] <recurse> double checking
[16:31:15] <recurse> grep 'ing from cli .. one sec
[16:32:11] <coldhead> i don't see it in that file
[16:32:34] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you check to see if something is checked?
[16:32:44] <tw2113> :checked
[16:33:00] <recurse> i dont either ... i also just searched the entire codebase and it didnt turn up function ajaxPopup_* .... still searching ... i dont get it
[16:33:08] * tw2113 fogs up coldhead's glasses so he can see clearer
[16:33:16] <code_ph0y> $('#bla').attr(':checked'); ?
[16:33:29] <tw2113> ?checked
[16:33:29] <bot-t> :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[16:33:33] <code_ph0y> no soz that doesn't make sense
[16:33:48] <code_ph0y> thanks bud!
[16:34:41] <code_ph0y> .is(':checked') !
[16:34:45] <code_ph0y> thanks again!
[16:35:00] <recurse> coldhead: its defined in page as window.ajaxPopup_3=new ajaxPopupTipObj({});
[16:35:20] <coldhead> ah
[16:35:27] <coldhead> that is well overengineered
[16:35:34] <recurse> ha, right!
[16:36:00] <recurse> id be willing to redo the way this is being done, namely with js, and pay for it, if you're familair with php, and it doesnt cost me a fortune
[16:36:09] <recurse> namely with jquery*
[16:36:23] <recurse> im a php / linux guy
[16:36:43] <recurse> my js acumen, not the strongest
[16:37:09] <coldhead> if it comes to that
[16:37:18] <coldhead> someone here will take you up
[16:37:31] <coldhead> i can't see the obvious problem
[16:37:31] <recurse> as it is now, id also being willing to pay for a "fix" ...
[16:37:39] <recurse> i think its due to the load()
[16:37:48] <recurse> but
[16:37:53] <recurse> if you have Firebug
[16:37:57] <recurse> if you run console
[16:38:00] <coldhead> load and onclick perhaps
[16:38:26] <someprimetime> is there a name for how this code is structured?
[16:38:27] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/swatK/
[16:38:32] <someprimetime> with b being the global namespace
[16:39:00] <someprimetime> and then initializing the member methods outside like b.tabs.init() ?
[16:39:50] <coldhead> recurse: i see these messages in my debugger
[16:39:50] <coldhead> Refused to set unsafe header "Connection"
[16:39:54] <coldhead> prototype.lite.js:179XHR finished loading: "http://www.zwavemart.com/ajax-blk.php".
[16:40:05] <recurse> unsafe connection yea
[16:40:06] <coldhead> and the response seems to be a valid page
[16:40:10] <recurse> but that happens even wen it works
[16:40:19] <recurse> yes
[16:40:19] <coldhead> but what i know about jQuery stripping out <script> may not apply
[16:40:28] <coldhead> because that call is being made by prootype
[16:40:33] <coldhead> prototype*
[16:40:40] <someprimetime> it's how i currently write a lot of js (getting into backbone now though) and i'm reading up on the Module pattern, but it seems that that pattern wraps everything in a closure
[16:40:51] <coldhead> why do you think it's the load(), recurse, and where is that happening?
[16:40:58] <someprimetime> and returns the inner methods to make them public
[16:41:04] <recurse> where is load happening?
[16:41:12] <coldhead> yes
[16:41:13] <Guest95126> coldhead:  can you please help me figure out how to reset the val to be emptry on hide, I've been working on it for forever, but can't figure it out.  After several attempts, this is the best idea I've had, but it doesn't work.   http://jsfiddle.net/wZawD/2/
[16:41:21] <recurse> can we take this to PM?
[16:41:28] <recurse> its gettnig noisey out here
[16:41:47] <someprimetime> nm i guess it's object literal
[16:42:10] <recurse> by the way you can catch me over at irc.phpfreaks.com anytime
[16:42:23] <recurse> anyway, if you sort
[16:42:33] <recurse> thats when its load()'ng
[16:43:06] <recurse> see, to sort - meaning change the product listings from grid view to list, I pass a var to the page
[16:43:10] <recurse> this var cols=
[16:43:26] <recurse> parses my table in php according to the count
[16:43:50] <recurse> i can pass it to the page, and the page refreshes and all is well and eveyrthing works
[16:43:56] <recurse> but a refresh and reload isnt sexy
[16:44:19] <recurse> so i used jquery to load() my page again and selctor'd the div i wanted
[16:44:25] <recurse> viola
[16:44:35] <recurse> except it fugged the quickview that slut
[16:44:40] <recurse> meh
[16:44:51] <someprimetime> o.O
[16:45:13] <recurse> yea sorry, used to phpfreaks ... no filters there =)~
[16:45:17] <Alpha64> i tried everything except the thing that works, what can be causing this behaviour of jquery-ui? http://i.imgur.com/rOZbd.png
[16:45:52] <coldhead> recurse: i know the problem
[16:45:58] <recurse> DO IT!
[16:46:00] <recurse> what?!
[16:46:03] <coldhead> it's the load, like you say
[16:46:08] <recurse> its gatta be!
[16:46:17] <coldhead> well, it's not the load, it's the crazy gomblicated way
[16:46:23] <coldhead> so when you load
[16:46:26] <coldhead> normallu
[16:46:27] <recurse> ha, yea im sure it is!
[16:46:29] <coldhead> normally
[16:46:31] <coldhead> this code runs
[16:46:32] <coldhead> window.ajaxPopup_3=new ajaxPopupTipObj({});
[16:46:43] <coldhead> for 3,4,5...
[16:46:50] <coldhead> and when you ajax load()
[16:46:54] <coldhead> that stuff doesn't run again
[16:46:57] <coldhead> and i suspect it needs to
[16:47:16] <coldhead> if you do the load
[16:47:22] <recurse> well ... knowing the problem is that much close to a solution!
[16:47:22] <coldhead> and then run that line at the console
[16:47:26] <coldhead> the popup works again
[16:47:33] <recurse> ohh
[16:47:38] <recurse> so ... lets fix
[16:47:54] <coldhead> there msust be some code in  ajaxPopupTipObj({});
[16:48:00] <coldhead> which binds to an actual element
[16:48:05] <coldhead> and when that element is replaced
[16:48:06] <coldhead> it breaks
[16:48:11] <Guest95126> coldhead??^^
[16:48:34] <recurse> Guest95126, patience!
[16:48:36] <coldhead> yeah i'll get back to you Guest95126
[16:48:37] <recurse> ;)
[16:48:52] <coldhead> i'm giving priority to more interesting questions and people with actual usernames
[16:48:57] <Guest95126> coldhead:  sry
[16:49:26] <Guest95126> I have a username, my irc client just hates to register it, lol
[16:50:13] <coldhead> recurse: i would try running something like this after the load http://jsfiddle.net/RgaUA/
[16:50:21] <coldhead> just to re-init all that horrible popup stuff
[16:51:02] <recurse> lemme test
[16:51:16] <coldhead> link me to your code again Guest95126
[16:51:16] <recurse> 15 i assume would be the max count
[16:51:24] <coldhead> yeah
[16:51:26] <recurse> gatcha
[16:51:31] <Guest95126> coldhead:  http://jsfiddle.net/wZawD/2/
[16:51:59] <coldhead> and Guest95126, in this conditional: if ($(this).is(':checked')) {
[16:52:04] <coldhead> you want to reset the val?
[16:54:14] <coldhead> Guest95126: i think you want something like http://jsfiddle.net/wZawD/3/
[16:54:56] <Guest95126> coldhead:  I want to reset in the else statement
[16:55:28] <jerkface03> Whats the difference between .live("click", ...) and .click(...)?
[16:55:33] <recurse> coldhead: forgive my ignorance - i tried http://pastebin.com/ud07swM5 .. youll notice at the bottom, inside the click event
[16:55:53] <recurse> it stops the pop from launching completly now, but i suspect i have it in the wrong place?
[16:55:59] <coldhead> Guest95126: just change 'goodbye' or 'hello' to ''
[16:56:14] <jerkface03> .live("click" doesn't work for dynamically added list items, but it does for statically added ones. I'm trying to find out why
[16:56:27] <coachz> hi
[16:56:46] <coachz> can anyone tell me why I get this error please ?  http://pastebin.com/6qPSfNTw
[16:56:49] <recurse> coldhead: youll also noticed i updated the click event also as you stated ... not sure that was the appropriate method either
[16:57:05] <coachz> it points to the try statement as the cause of the error
[16:57:59] <coachz> but i don't see any reason for the error
[16:58:16] <coldhead> recurse: http://pastebin.com/CBLpXzZP
[16:58:28] <Caelum> how do I invoke my form plugin submit function from an onclick handler? onclick="$('#form').submit();" just submits the form without the plugin
[16:58:54] <coldhead> Caelum: use click(), not onclick
[16:59:04] <coldhead> and then you might want $('#form')[0].submit()
[16:59:10] <coldhead> to run the native submit
[16:59:14] <coldhead> rather than just the handler
[17:00:17] <Guest95126> coldhead:  tnx so much!!
[17:01:12] <coldhead> coachz: i don't get that error http://jsfiddle.net/ruMLW/
[17:01:16] <coldhead> are you sure that's the offending code?
[17:01:26] <coldhead> Guest95126: you are welcome, have a lucky day
[17:01:43] <recurse> coldhead: i change window['ajaxPopup_' + i] = new ajaxPopupTipObj({}); to window['ajaxPopup_'+i] = new ajaxPopupTipObj({}); (removed the whitespace inside window['ajaxPopup_'+i] ) ... and it got the pop to fire again, but we're in the same boat as before it seems
[17:01:43] <Caelum> coldhead: oh duh, I forgot to call ajaxForm()...
[17:02:09] <recurse> the pop fires, with a perpectual loading ...
[17:02:21] <recurse> perpetual*
[17:02:58] <coldhead> recurse: i think you have two options
[17:03:09] <coldhead> either fix the prototype code
[17:03:15] <coldhead> so it uses selectors to show the popup
[17:03:26] <coldhead> and not specific elements which are ditched when you load()
[17:03:27] <coldhead> OR
[17:03:30] <coldhead> (more easily)
[17:03:41] <coldhead> DON'T replace the page when you do load()
[17:03:48] <coldhead> load it into a new div and hide the old one
[17:03:53] <coldhead> then when you go back, show it again
[17:04:03] <coldhead> and the prototype stuff should work
[17:04:32] <recurse> hmm
[17:05:11] <coachz> coldhead,   http://i.imgur.com/Lofa9.png    http://i.imgur.com/w34A4.png
[17:05:19] <recurse> what i dont get is
[17:05:20] <coachz> that's the error i get
[17:05:52] <recurse> if you open up console in firebug and expand the response and click the html tab
[17:05:54] <recurse> its all there
[17:05:57] <recurse> the html
[17:06:08] <recurse> its this js thats stripped i believe
[17:06:18] <recurse> i could be wrong,
[17:06:22] <recurse> how can we test that ?
[17:06:52] <recurse> this.transport.send(this.postBody); this is the line that it points to inside ptototype
[17:06:56] <recurse> 179
[17:06:59] <recurse> when firing
[17:07:02] <recurse> just an FYI
[17:07:13] <recurse> im willing to try anything that works at this point
[17:07:29] <Alpha64> how can i force an accordion div to be as big as the content?
[17:07:32] <recurse> less quick and dirty and more best practive preferably
[17:07:44] <recurse> Alpha64 its your styles
[17:07:52] <recurse> you gatta play with your css
[17:08:22] <recurse> try height:auto;
[17:08:33] <recurse> and/or min-height: also
[17:09:19] <Alpha64> let's see
[17:09:51] <coachz> i think i found it
[17:10:12] <coldhead> i hope so coachz, i can't see the problem
[17:10:20] <coachz> thanks coldhead
[17:10:21] <coldhead> i just had a look at the corner.js and that code is horrible
[17:10:27] <coldhead> it deserves a comment at the very least
[17:10:41] <coachz> haha
[17:11:26] <recurse> coldhead: just researching some and maybe this may make some sense to you more then me
[17:11:28] <recurse> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5952123/jquery-load-with-script-tags
[17:12:16] <Alpha64> min-height is working but auto doesn't
[17:12:36] <recurse> min-height is same as height really
[17:12:55] <recurse> well, depends if you wants your contents to scroll
[17:13:02] <recurse> just try height
[17:13:09] <livingstn> Anyone familiar with bxSlider? Any idea why the quotes on this page aren't aligning properly by default? http://tc.jeremylivingston.net/about-us/
[17:15:16] <recurse> also, would it make sense to consider reformating the table with jquery oppsed to going through through this retarded process of loading in the page contents with a url var ?
[17:15:34] <recurse> (just thinking outload)
[17:21:55] <recurse> coldhead
[17:21:58] <recurse> i think i see the issue
[17:22:15] <recurse> When .load() returns HTML content that contains <script> tags, jQuery strips out the <script> tags, moves them,1 executes them, and then removes them.
[17:22:27] <recurse> Either to the <head>, or the parentmost element â€” I haven't found an authoritative source on this yet, though I could just check the jQuery source...
[17:22:47] <recurse> thats from that stackoverflow thread
[17:23:21] <coldhead> right, and it may be that the code that is executed is somehow sensitive to where in the document it is loaded
[17:23:35] <coldhead> it might use that work out where the relevant data to show is
[17:23:37] <recurse> right ... in our case prior to sort, and right below <div id="ajaxPopup_3">
[17:23:39] <coldhead> and can't find it in the head
[17:24:00] <recurse> this is right below that div PRIOR to sorting
[17:24:04] <recurse> <script type="text/javascript">
[17:24:05] <recurse> window.ajaxPopup_3=new ajaxPopupTipObj({});
[17:24:07] <recurse> </script>
[17:24:09] <recurse> after sorting
[17:24:10] <recurse> its gone
[17:24:26] <coldhead> so that's why my code to just rerun that doesn't work
[17:24:33] <recurse> aye
[17:24:35] <coldhead> because it wasn't in the right position either
[17:24:40] <coldhead> god that is some horrible code
[17:24:43] <recurse> this is also gone :
[17:24:45] <recurse> script type="text/javascript">
[17:24:47] <recurse> ajaxPopup_3.popups=[$('ajaxPopup_3_popup_0')];
[17:24:49] <recurse> ajaxPopup_3.actions=[function(){new ajax('/ajax-blk.php',{postBody:'blk=blk_box_ajax_popup&templ=tweak&blkid=ajaxPopup_3&section=content&ctx_product=blk_product_main,pid:42',update:$('ajaxPopup_3_content')});;return true;}];
[17:24:50] <recurse> ajaxPopup_3.tipobj=$('ajaxPopup_3_popup_0');
[17:24:52] <recurse> </script>
[17:24:55] <recurse> forgive me for posting code like that
[17:25:10] <recurse> so both of these get stripped by load() and moved
[17:25:18] <recurse> wtf is that jquery?
[17:25:30] <recurse> reminds me of code cleanup and tinymce days
[17:25:44] <coldhead> i don't mind jQuery moving the scripts
[17:25:49] <recurse> so the question is, how do we prevent that ?
[17:25:53] <coldhead> it sucks to have scripts that are location dependent
[17:26:00] <coldhead> you can prevent it like i keep saying
[17:26:04] <coldhead> by not removing the elements
[17:26:10] <recurse> how?
[17:26:13] <recurse> im sorry
[17:26:15] <coldhead> just showing/hiding the container
[17:26:21] <recurse> oh
[17:26:23] <recurse> err
[17:26:26] <coldhead> so instead of one div that shows sorted/thumbnails
[17:26:28] <coldhead> two divs
[17:26:29] <recurse> that seams so sloppy
[17:26:30] <coldhead> one for each
[17:26:45] <coldhead> it's actually more efficient than making a new ajax request for data you already have every time
[17:26:51] <recurse> also i worried about Search engines and duplication of results and hidden page content
[17:27:04] <coldhead> don't duplicate the results in the HTML
[17:27:07] <coldhead> just have one
[17:27:18] <coldhead> do all the loading() hide()ing and show()ing in the JS
[17:27:46] <recurse> i thought i was doing that ?
[17:27:47] <coldhead> OR rewrite the prototype to be able to find all the stuff it needs for the popup regardless of where the <script> is
[17:27:57] <coldhead> they're both kinda gross but what else can you do
[17:28:03] <coldhead> mixing prototype and jQuery is gross too
[17:28:18] <recurse> i know .. the codebase was deved originally with prototype
[17:28:21] <recurse> prior to jquery
[17:28:28] <recurse> so alot of features are dependenat
[17:28:42] <recurse> ptototype lite is 5kb by the way
[17:28:58] <coldhead> it's more the conflicts that may arise
[17:29:02] <coldhead> than the file size
[17:29:09] <recurse> however, jquery is far more robust and as the years ticked on and its gotten better, ive adopted it
[17:29:23] <recurse> where talking 2006
[17:29:35] <recurse> heh ... i would live to normalize everything
[17:29:46] <recurse> love*
[17:29:54] <recurse> under one framework
[17:30:12] <recurse> seeing as how prototype lite is no longer maintained
[17:30:43] <coldhead> i would love not to have lost my legs in a terrible accident
[17:30:48] <coldhead> we can't have everything we want
[17:30:52] <coldhead> or indeed, most things
[17:32:11] <Marnix_I_> What would be a smart way to find all the links currently in the DOM?
[17:32:25] <coldhead> recurse: i would rewrite all the popup_n functions as a single popup that works for all cases, before and after load()
[17:32:33] <coldhead> assuming i knew prototype anyway
[17:32:46] <coldhead> Marnix_I_: $('a'), surprisingly enough
[17:32:49] <recurse> can you do it in jquery?
[17:33:10] <coldhead> i don't know recurse, i'd have to understand the prototype to convert it
[17:33:14] <coldhead> there seems to be a lot there
[17:33:20] <Marnix_I_> lol that was to simple that i didnt even consider it
[17:33:27] <Marnix_I_> working at 03:00AM should be forbidden
[17:33:41] <recurse> where you guys from at 3am?
[17:33:49] <recurse> Australia?
[17:34:12] <Marnix_I_> Netherlands :)
[17:34:41] <recurse> oh wait, its 8:34pm here (East coast US)
[17:34:49] <recurse> i thought it was earlier =)~
[17:34:51] <Marnix_I_> yeah well precise time would be 02:34 ;)
[17:35:13] <coldhead> it's midday on the australian east coast
[17:35:16] <coldhead> BEST COAST
[17:35:30] <recurse> coldhead i take it you're in Australia?
[17:35:42] <recurse> very cool ... one of the places i dream to visit
[17:36:12] <coldhead> eh it's not that great
[17:36:23] <coldhead> but you probably should anyway
[17:36:30] <recurse> whats not so great?
[17:36:59] <recurse> damn aboriginee's and their dijaradoos?
[17:37:09] <recurse> heh
[17:37:26] <recurse> or the rabid roos
[17:37:48] <coldhead> mostly the heat
[17:37:55] <recurse> oh
[17:38:03] <recurse> is the entire continent hot?
[17:38:03] <coldhead> and the cultural wasteland
[17:38:14] <coldhead> it's mostly too warm, yes
[17:38:16] <recurse> cultural wasteland? how so?
[17:38:32] <recurse> arent you guys brits anyway?
[17:38:38] <recurse> at some point?
[17:39:02] <recurse> your culture and history and quite deep id imagine
[17:39:21] <coldhead> we're a barely 200 year old penal colony
[17:39:40] <coldhead> we basically just think everything is stupid except whatever the US dishes out
[17:39:45] <recurse> well i guess you're right in some sense
[17:40:05] <recurse> wait, you guys think the US dishes out non-stupidity?
[17:40:13] <recurse> arent we the epicenter of stupidity on earth?
[17:40:22] <recurse> i mean stupid starts with honey boo boo
[17:40:58] <coldhead> we don't discriminate
[17:41:11] <coldhead> "ooh hollywood, this must be so much better than anything we could come up with"
[17:41:13] <recurse> i take it the honey boo boo phenomenon hasnt reaches Australia yet
[17:41:58] <recurse> Whats wrong with America? = honey fuggin boo boo
[17:42:01] <recurse> ha
[17:42:09] <recurse> so back to this load() stipping out my js
[17:42:26] <Marnix_I_> trying to set a new attribute for each link? this should work no? 	$('a').each(function(){ $(this).attr('data-ajax', 'true'); });
[17:46:37] <livingstn> Anyone have any recommendations for a responsive content slider? Tried bxSlider, but I'm getting weird issues
[17:47:37] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I am looking for something that I had found a while ago but lost the bookmark for. It was a jquery plugin that let you basically "punch a hole" in a background so you could see the background of the container behind it through that hole. Ring any bells?
[17:47:49] <coldhead> like i said recurse: either make the stripping out irrelevant by not overwriting with the load() OR rewrite the popup to work anyway
[17:47:54] <coldhead> hey LindsayMac
[17:48:01] <LindsayMac> hey coldhead
[17:48:08] <coldhead> i don't remember that, no
[17:48:12] <coldhead> i barely remember anything
[17:48:28] <coldhead> livingstn: did you try the one by the filament group?
[17:48:35] <coldhead> those guys are responsive as hell
[17:48:40] <livingstn> coldhead: Let me see...
[17:49:02] <recurse> coldhead - http://www.gothambranding.com/dev
[17:50:05] <livingstn> coldhead: Do you have a link?
[17:50:26] <coldhead> http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_carousel/
[17:50:35] <recurse> coldhead perhaps there is an alternative jquery method
[17:51:39] <recurse> instead of load()
[17:51:55] <coldhead> load_and_dont_fuck_up_my_scripts
[17:51:57] <coldhead> no
[17:51:59] <coldhead> that's not a thing
[17:52:29] <recurse> lol
[17:52:49] <coldhead> recurse: if you still want to use load()
[17:52:57] <recurse> i was thinking more of $.ajax({
[17:52:58] <coldhead> you can extend the work we were already doing
[17:52:59] <recurse> url: path + 'cols=1',
[17:53:00] <recurse> dataType: 'html',
[17:53:02] <recurse> ..........
[17:53:08] <coldhead> get ALL the <script> stuff that gets stripped
[17:53:19] <recurse> i tried to extend by adding in the missing script stuff and using yout loop
[17:53:20] <coldhead> put it in a fn called fix_my_popups()
[17:53:21] <recurse> but
[17:53:25] <recurse> came across product id
[17:53:29] <coldhead> and call it in the load callback
[17:53:35] <recurse> no idea how the hell thats pulled into the script ..
[17:53:49] <coldhead> probably related to the bug then >: |
[17:53:51] <coldhead> sucks
[17:54:14] <recurse> ajax('/ajax-blk.php',{postBody:'blk=blk_box_ajax_popup&amp;templ=tweak&amp;blkid=ajaxPopup_3&amp;section=content&amp;ctx_product=blk_product_main,pid:42',update:$('ajaxPopup_3_content')});;return true;}];
[17:54:17] <recurse> that
[17:54:27] <livingstn> coldhead: Checking it out now. Thank you.
[17:54:38] <recurse> see pid
[17:54:53] <coldhead> gross
[17:55:32] <aqeel> hi room
[17:55:39] <recurse>  for (var i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
[17:55:41] <coldhead> oh god it's aqeel
[17:55:41] <recurse> window['ajaxPopup_'+i] = new ajaxPopupTipObj({});
[17:55:43] <recurse> ajaxPopup_3.popups=[$('ajaxPopup_'+i+'_popup_0')];
[17:55:45] <recurse> ajaxPopup_'+i+'.actions=[function(){new ajax('/ajax-blk.php',{postBody:'blk=blk_box_ajax_popup&amp;templ=tweak&amp;blkid=ajaxPopup_3&amp;section=content&amp;ctx_product=blk_product_main,pid:42',update:$('ajaxPopup_3_content')});;return true;}];
[17:55:46] <recurse> ajaxPopup_3.tipobj=$('ajaxPopup_3_popup_0');
[17:55:47] <LindsayMac> I cant believe i cant find this darn plugin!
[17:55:48] <recurse> }
[17:55:55] <recurse> i started to go through your loop
[17:55:56] <aqeel> ??? why what happen?
[17:55:58] <coldhead> ?p @ recurse
[17:55:59] <bot-t> recurse, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:56:04] <recurse> sorry
[17:56:31] <coldhead> it's cool
[17:56:31] <recurse> i came across that line with pid and stopped ... nothing i can do there ...
[17:56:34] <coldhead> i was kidding aqeel
[17:56:42] <aqeel> lol
[17:56:44] <aqeel> ok
[17:56:51] <coldhead> yeah i know what you mean recurse
[17:57:04] <coldhead> it's just a really gross way to do popups
[17:57:09] <coldhead> popup_174
[17:57:13] <coldhead> a function for each
[17:57:16] <coldhead> all hanging off window
[17:57:17] <recurse> yes
[17:57:19] <coldhead> kill me right now
[17:57:23] <recurse> ha
[17:57:26] <recurse> tell me about it
[17:57:32] <recurse> the sleeping monster
[17:57:42] <recurse> now im poking it
[17:58:40] <recurse> so changing function to ajax and dataType html
[17:58:42] <recurse> wont help ?
[17:58:46] <coldhead> no
[17:58:59] <coldhead> jquery strips <script>s everywhere
[17:59:00] <recurse> meh =/
[17:59:22] <recurse> then why am i using jquery? can i do this without a library?
[17:59:33] <recurse> native functions that dont strip tags?
[17:59:44] <coldhead> jquery is trying to protect you by stripping scripts
[17:59:49] <coldhead> make sure you only run the code you want
[18:00:01] <recurse> i dont need a damn nanny jquery, you whore
[18:00:05] <coldhead> if you want to do without it you get to enter the fun world of handling XHR in different browsers
[18:00:12] <coldhead> all by yourself
[18:00:16] <recurse> lol
[18:00:17] <coldhead> which god spare us
[18:00:22] <recurse> fair enough
[18:01:15] <recurse> umm
[18:01:25] <recurse> why not ajax data type script?
[18:02:34] <beglol> I got brain freeze, what are .appendto, .css and those commands called?
[18:03:02] <recurse> commands? those look like classes?
[18:03:36] <recurse> coldhead, ajax dataType script ...
[18:03:44] <recurse> whatcha think?
[18:03:47] <LindsayMac> woo found something.. not what I had found before, but this can work http://adrengski.com/holemaker1
[18:03:56] <coldhead> beglol: methods
[18:04:24] <coldhead> recurse: you could have the server return JSON
[18:04:30] <coldhead> with the html, for  you to insert
[18:04:39] <coldhead> and the <script> for you to eval
[18:04:41] <beglol> Well I saw that there was no such thing as .inner and i'd like to find somewhere where i can read about what properties objects can have :p
[18:04:44] <recurse> i wouldnt even know where to start honestly
[18:04:58] <coldhead> no it's not how i'd do it either
[18:05:09] <coldhead> but it's the next step in your reasoning
[18:05:16] <coldhead> then comes anger, then bargaining
[18:05:19] <coldhead> and finally acceptance
[18:05:21] <recurse> lol
[18:06:44] <recurse> well. thats why im in a jquery irc chattoom ... outside of my normal "comfort zone" .. looking for guidance from those who know more then I ... Ive accepted the fact that i cannot due this alone .. not without spending a week creating a resource intensive rats nest
[18:07:12] <recurse> but i still dont know the answer really
[18:07:43] <LindsayMac> ugh thats not gonna work
[18:08:05] <LindsayMac> Does anyone know how to achieve this "punch through" effect without using multiple BG images like this example? http://adrengski.com/holemaker1
[18:10:37] <danmichel> I added $('#home_conta').load(<?php "'" . get_template_directory() . '/loop-slideshow.php' . " #featured'" ?>); to my test site, http://theplural.com/ but I'm not sure if it's working because the site loads instantly for me, as it's my home server. basically trying to load what's in that div asynchronously  . the site is loading the same as my live site http://varmag.com/ . From what i understand, .load should make the slider load asynchron
[18:12:41] <recurse> danmichel are you trying to load this external domain in via load()?
[18:12:59] <aqeel> http://jquerytools.org/download/
[18:13:02] <recurse> because i dont think you can - Cross site scripting restriction
[18:13:04] <aqeel> anyone tried this
[18:13:56] <danmichel> recurse: no, I'm just trying to load the slider after the page has loaded, or not load the slider div until all of the images within the slider are loaded recurse. however i can accomplish that
[18:14:28] <recurse> coldhead http://pastebin.com/8jjJRBdU these are all the scripts that are included EACH time
[18:14:55] <recurse> why there are multiple instances of the same js being included is bad design surely ...
[18:19:35] <recurse> i also see load() is stripping out the tags and load reinserting them anywhere due to me loading in only a selected portion of the page
[18:26:05] <recurse> coldhead? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[18:27:03] <recurse> you're saying i can request the page as a json obeject and parse it?
[18:27:05] <recurse> how?!
[18:27:50] <coldhead> you'd  have to teach the server to emit JSON first
[18:30:28] <coldhead> recurse: http://jsfiddle.net/MXwsL/
[18:42:25] <joobie> hey guys.. any idea why http://pastebin.com/WrqF5uVX would not be able to scroll the iframe content?
[18:42:41] <joobie> the iframe is in the same security domain that im accessing the page from
[18:42:53] <joobie> hoping to get the iframe to scroll down, but it's not atm
[18:42:56] <joobie> no JS errors
[18:51:30] <recurse> coldhead: the docs say     jQuery(".prodListingTable").load(path + "?cols=3 .prodListingTable, script");, function() {  should work - notice the , script" at the end
[18:51:46] <recurse> (but yet it doesnt!)
[18:52:20] <recurse> coldhead: this is what i followed for this tip
[18:52:21] <recurse> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1317080/jquery-ajax-load-java-script-not-executing
[18:55:26] <coldhead> joobie: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1852518/how-to-get-scrolltop-of-an-iframe
[18:56:02] <xenome-> is there a way to make a call asynchronously from my UI processing code that won't stall the UI when performing a GET call to the server?
[18:56:20] <coldhead> recurse: i have never known <script> tags to be executable via ajax
[18:56:36] <fission6> xenome-: yeah ajax
[18:56:47] <coldhead> i always tell people to move the <script> out of the page and run the actual JS from an actual javascript file
[19:00:07] <royalty> hello how do i select all the children of the parent element and put them in an array?
[19:00:07] <xenome-> well I'm making what I think is an ajax/json call...but it still seems to slow down my UI
[19:00:26] <joobie> coldhead, there's a few different alternatives there - is the one you were thinking of this: ('#scroller').contents().animate({scrollTop: 50}, 'slow');
[19:00:27] <fission6> royalty: children()
[19:00:34] <royalty> I completely forgot a lot of jquery since I haven't used it in forever
[19:00:36] <royalty> thanks
[19:00:38] <joobie> coldhead, i have tried about 10 different variations on this.. still no success
[19:00:50] <joobie> coldhead, ('#scroller').contents().animate({scrollTop: 50}, 'slow'); does not scroll btw
[19:00:59] <fission6> xenome-: hmm do you have a public page you can link
[19:01:34] <joobie> coldhead, btw I need to do this from the jquery loaded outside the iframe, if that helps
[19:01:47] <recurse> coldhead, well i cant say its brought me any luck
[19:02:14] <coldhead> it may not be possible, joobie
[19:02:36] <coldhead> god you people all have such depressing problems
[19:02:41] <coldhead> i am going to a titty bar for lunch
[19:02:42] <joobie> heh :)
[19:02:42] <coldhead> brb
[19:02:44] <joobie> lol
[19:02:48] <recurse> ha!
[19:03:19] <joobie> hopefully you will find the answer to my problem whilst buried in those titties
[19:06:48] <aqeel> fission6 that day i managed to get hold of the content from load window
[19:07:43] <aqeel> the element s were not being accessible after being loaded...
[19:07:59] <aqeel> now works like a charm
[19:08:03] <royalty> so if i did var foo = $(selector).children(); could I then call a member of children like foo[0]; ?
[19:14:26] <someprimetime> royalty: yes
[19:14:43] <royalty> cool
[19:14:46] <royalty> thank you
[19:15:19] <someprimetime> it just creates an array of DOM objects essentially
[19:16:51] <royalty> nice that is what i need
[19:17:50] <aqeel> http://jquerytools.org/download/
[19:18:01] <aqeel> where can i download the uncompressed version
[19:18:08] <aqeel> link seems not to work
[19:25:35] <xenome-> i have a jquery widget that runs pretty well under all browsers except iOS (works fine in android), is there a way to profile the javascript to see what's causing my issue?
[19:25:47] <xenome-> jquery ui to be specific
[19:29:21] <aqeel> try jquery mobile
[19:36:10] <coldhead> no u
[19:38:46] <tw2113> do it coldhead, use jquery mobile they said, it'll be a good experience they said
[19:40:35] <coldhead> i never said that
[19:40:44] <coldhead> the lesson is never believe anyone about anything
[19:47:08] <recurse> like the stripper telling you how buff your looking lately?
[19:47:12] <recurse> heh
[19:47:15] <recurse> how was lunch?
[19:47:46] <coldhead> there were no strippers
[19:47:52] <coldhead> there wasn't even a caesar salad
[19:47:57] <coldhead> 2pm is too late for lunch
[19:48:03] <coldhead> it's a bloody outrage
[19:48:50] <joobie> guys, when I use "$('#scroller').contents().scrollTop(50);" to scoll an iframe with id=scroller, it works.. but when I try $('#scroller').contents().animate({ scrollTop : 50 }); it doesn't work.. any idea why?
[19:48:54] <joobie> it's like the animate trips up on it
[19:49:23] <recurse> coldhead i hunted down the class that generates the popup guts http://pastebin.com/F65c49xQ
[19:50:07] <coldhead> oh god
[19:50:14] <coldhead> it's hideous
[19:50:36] <joobie> oo.. i actually get an error back when I try using it with animate() - the error says "Error: TypeError: invalid 'in' operand a" and it referrs to jquery-1.8.2.min.js line 2
[19:51:42] <coldhead> its probably something to do with how animate works with scrollTop internaally
[19:51:52] <coldhead> something non-iframe friendly
[19:51:56] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[19:52:03] <joobie> oh
[19:52:05] <joobie> that sucks
[19:52:18] <joobie> so I found a jquery bug?
[19:52:47] <coldhead> it's probably a wontfix
[19:52:51] <coldhead> because iframes are painful
[19:52:59] <coldhead> and we are grateful that we can use them at all
[19:53:24] <coldhead> joobie: if you can be bothered, check out ariel fleisler's scrollTo plugin
[19:53:31] <coldhead> see if/how it handles iframes
[19:53:43] <coldhead> and either use his plugin or borrow his code
[19:53:58] <coldhead> ?cc @ chee
[19:53:59] <bot-t> chee, CASE CLOASED >: |
[19:54:17] <joobie> can I log a bug to get this jquery issue resolved?
[19:54:25] <chee> D:1
[19:54:26] <coldhead> you're welcome to try!
[19:54:31] <coldhead> it might be resolved "wontfix"
[19:54:34] <coldhead> because as i said
[19:54:38] <coldhead> IFRAMES ARE WITCHCRAFT
[19:55:07] <joobie> my issue is I have a html file that i need to display wrapped around other content.. i can't modify the html file, the html file is local to me
[19:55:14] <coldhead> it's like filing a bug because "my car doesn't function correctly under water"
[19:55:19] <joobie> so i use an iframe to point to the html file .. any other ways you can see around it?
[19:55:27] <chee> $.get like a boss ?
[19:55:30] <joobie> the other issue is the html file can be large, so i need it to auto-scroll
[19:55:59] <recurse> damnit ... i feel defeated ...
[19:56:06] <recurse> this load() shit is kicking my arse
[19:56:34] <coldhead> there's always hide/show, recurse
[19:56:51] <coldhead> or you might enjoying finding the original author of the code and bludgeoning them with a pool cue
[19:57:07] <recurse> haha yes the thought has crossed my mind
[19:59:14] <joobie> coldhead, does Aierl's JS scroll content within a particular id? it kinda looks like it just scrolls the window to a paritcular element on the page, rather than contentw ithin
[20:02:13] <recurse> im willing to try anything at this point coldhead. how do you recommend i do your show/hide suggestion, without cuasing duplication on the page (even if dups are hidden at the moment)
[20:02:47] <joobie> wow
[20:02:48] <joobie> it works
[20:03:05] <joobie> Ariel Fleisler > Google
[20:06:03] <coldhead> recurse: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/tyRXj/
[20:07:45] <recurse> hmm
[20:08:04] <recurse> hide() show() completly remove elements from dom?
[20:08:11] <recurse> ill try it now
[20:09:10] <recurse> coldhead these container references ...
[20:09:17] <recurse> they expect some dummy container on page?
[20:09:26] <coldhead> yes
[20:09:29] <recurse> one is my original, the other is a dummy?
[20:09:36] <coldhead> exactly!
[20:09:38] <recurse> ok
[20:13:23] <recurse> wait
[20:13:27] <recurse> you're still using load
[20:13:34] <recurse> how does this solve anything?
[20:13:39] <recurse> oh...
[20:13:43] <recurse> i think i know
[20:13:54] <recurse> but the scripts have to be included in a particular order?
[20:14:02] <recurse> and if they are located in some hidden div .?
[20:14:06] <recurse> i dont get it
[20:14:08] <coldhead> it still does the load in the dummy
[20:14:14] <coldhead> but when they click back
[20:14:20] <coldhead> the container has children
[20:14:23] <coldhead> so it doesn't load()
[20:14:37] <coldhead> so the scripts don't matter
[20:14:43] <coldhead> if they work when the page first loads
[20:14:48] <coldhead> they'll work ever after
[20:21:18] <coldhead> guys i am so fucking high
[20:21:24] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[20:24:09] <recurse> haha
[20:24:25] * recurse re-lights his spliff
[20:25:05] <recurse> http://pastebin.com/S7EsC9bE
[20:25:19] <recurse> so that does exaclty what we did before
[20:25:52] <malibu> Hi there, I have a div nested three deep that I want to select on, can anyone tell me why it is not triggering the .click() ?
[20:25:53] <malibu> http://jsfiddle.net/VeY5P/
[20:25:53] <recurse> except now it loads into a new div .. which cuases  a slight delay, but best of all, it doesnt fix the popup contents issue ... meh =/
[20:26:32] <recurse> the docs say usng a selector with load() strips script tags
[20:26:33] <coldhead> recurse: i assume that when you click the other icon to go back to the first container you are doing load() again
[20:26:54] <recurse> i didnt test on loading back yet
[20:27:01] <recurse> just a single swap
[20:27:22] <coldhead> oh you can open popups from both views?
[20:27:25] <livingstn> coldhead: So I tried using that Filament Group plugin, but the transitions seem a little weirdâ€¦and it looks like I may have to have the exact heights for all of my images.
[20:27:27] <coldhead> i didn't see that
[20:27:31] <recurse> umm
[20:27:33] <recurse> yes?
[20:27:41] <recurse> sorry if that wasnt clear
[20:27:43] <coldhead> livingstn: that's very likely
[20:28:04] <coldhead> recurse: then the dummy container idea is fucked
[20:28:09] <livingstn> coldhead: Do you have any advice on how to get this fade to be a little less odd? http://tc.jeremylivingston.net/about-us/
[20:28:15] <livingstn> under "What people are saying about us"
[20:28:21] <coldhead> if you have to load popupable content via ajax you need to the popup to cope with ajax content
[20:30:48] <livingstn> Looks like setting a background color makes it better
[20:30:56] <coldhead> that was what i was just testing :)
[20:31:04] <livingstn> Nice.
[20:31:05] <coldhead> good job livingstn !
[20:31:08] <livingstn> :)
[20:31:17] <livingstn> Now if only I could find a reliable side-scroller
[20:31:28] <livingstn> for the marquee under Trusted By here: http://tc.jeremylivingston.net/
[20:31:34] <coldhead> recurse: your best bet might be to ask the #prototype dudes how to fix the popup(s)
[20:31:45] <livingstn> the one that I have waits for the image's left side to hit the left edge before it shows the next
[20:32:01] <livingstn> so I tried putting them all in one imageâ€¦and it only displays it at the width of the container
[20:32:05] <recurse> we determined it wasnt a prototype issue but a load() with selector issue, didnt we?
[20:32:16] <recurse> there is no conflict
[20:32:28] <recurse> the issue is load() strips the damn script tags out
[20:32:39] <recurse> it does this when using a selector
[20:32:44] <recurse> not when using alone
[20:32:49] <coldhead> that is not the issue, recurse
[20:33:03] <coldhead> the issue is that the popup depends on script tags
[20:33:16] <recurse> sure it is, im looking at source post sort and all the script tags have been pruged
[20:33:25] <coldhead> yes that's expected behaviour
[20:33:29] <recurse> aye
[20:33:38] <coldhead> when you write a popup you put your JS in a JS file
[20:33:38] <recurse> well not my expectations, but meh yes
[20:33:45] <coldhead> and then you don't have to worry about the <script> tags
[20:34:01] <coldhead> the reason is strips the script tags is because if you are loading the same page repeatedly
[20:34:06] <recurse> see the thing is, this had to be constructed conditionally,
[20:34:09] <coldhead> you don't want to run the initialisation code repeatedly
[20:34:20] <recurse> and the ids and shit are all based on php parsed output
[20:34:23] <coldhead> and if you DO, you move that code somewhere else and call it explicitly
[20:34:29] <coldhead> yes i saw, recurse
[20:34:33] <coldhead> it's a clusterfuck
[20:34:49] <recurse> some of it is, indeed
[20:34:57] <coldhead> a lazy fix might be to create a patched version of jQuery that leaves script tags in
[20:35:04] <recurse> some is a necessary evil
[20:35:08] <coldhead> if you want to look at the jQuery src and assess if you're up to it
[20:35:15] <recurse> ohh
[20:35:20] <recurse> i didnt think of that
[20:35:30] <recurse> but ... thats a whole other animal
[20:35:53] <recurse> perhaps theres some code cleanup flag i can set to flase
[20:36:02] <coldhead> there isn't
[20:36:06] <coldhead> but you can add one!
[20:37:31] <recurse> err
[20:37:38] <recurse> is load() depracated?
[20:37:56] <recurse> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11733
[20:38:00] <coldhead> recurse: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L190
[20:38:10] <coldhead> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L15
[20:38:16] <coldhead> doesn't look too hard
[20:38:21] <coldhead> no load isn't deprecated
[20:39:13] <recurse> that ajax.js
[20:39:19] <recurse> im using jquery min 1.8
[20:39:29] <recurse> no other plugin to achieve load
[20:39:44] <coldhead> that is the jQuery src
[20:39:48] <recurse> oh you where pointing out how they did it
[20:39:50] <coldhead> i am proposing you edit jQuery
[20:39:52] <coldhead> yes
[20:40:13] <recurse> well
[20:40:24] <recurse> another conundrum is i use jquery from cache
[20:40:28] <recurse> google cache
[20:40:31] <coldhead> apparently leaving the <script>s in causes a bug in IE
[20:40:58] <recurse> well shit thats not ganna work then is it
[20:41:04] <recurse> leaving scripts in where?
[20:41:10] <recurse> in the page as they are?
[20:41:14] <livingstn> coldhead: Do you have any suggestions for the type of animation that I have under Trusted By on the start page here? http://tc.jeremylivingston.net/
[20:41:17] <recurse> and not fuggin touching them ?
[20:41:29] <coldhead> when you inject some content with <script>
[20:41:33] <coldhead> it freaks out in IE
[20:41:36] <coldhead> apparently
[20:41:42] <coldhead> which is also why jQuery removes them
[20:41:44] <coldhead> according to the comment
[20:41:51] <recurse> is this < IE 8 ?
[20:41:58] <coldhead> the comment doesn't say
[20:42:00] <coldhead> and it's news to me
[20:42:06] <recurse> meh ... fuckin comments
[20:42:20] <recurse> this sucks
[20:42:26] <recurse> hours on this bullshit
[20:42:30] <recurse> i got other shit to do!
[20:42:35] <recurse> =/
[20:42:46] <coldhead> the only thing that we haven't exhausted yet is fixing the fucking plugin code
[20:42:56] <coldhead> which would be a matter for #prototype
[20:43:16] <recurse> but
[20:43:54] <recurse> i dont get why prototype is issue if the expected behavior of load is to strip the script tags
[20:44:10] <coldhead> make the prototype code not depend on <script> tags
[20:44:11] <coldhead> and voila
[20:44:17] <coldhead> problem solved
[20:44:38] <recurse> thats a matter of re writing that php class i showed you
[20:44:44] <recurse> not really prototype
[20:44:53] <royalty> this script doesn't seem to be working http://pastebin.com/YSRJL4rX
[20:44:54] <recurse> the proto type specific code is already included on page
[20:45:09] <recurse> its included every time in script but doesnt have to be (i can remove and include once in head)
[20:45:11] <coldhead> having a single popup function rather than popup_28824824 is definitely a prototype issue
[20:45:15] <coldhead> as well as a php one
[20:46:07] <recurse> im wondering if there is a way to fool jquery
[20:46:19] <recurse> i tried to encode the script tags, but that didnt work
[20:47:21] <coldhead> if you don't use load()
[20:47:27] <coldhead> and use ajax() instead
[20:47:38] <coldhead> then in theory you will have more control over what happens to the data it retrieves
[20:47:45] <coldhead> it might still try to remove the <script>s
[20:47:51] <coldhead> but it might not!
[20:47:56] <recurse> i think io tried and it was the same shit
[20:48:00] <coldhead> and if it doesn't then you can retain them
[20:48:05] <coldhead> and upset IE
[20:48:28] <recurse> 	jQuery.getScript(path);
[20:48:31] <recurse> tried that
[20:48:45] <recurse> which is same as ajax datatype script
[20:48:59] <recurse> but that doesnt help
[20:49:11] <coldhead> recurse: $.ajax('that_url', function (html) { var s = $(html).find('script'); console.log(s); });
[20:49:14] <coldhead> that's what i'd try
[20:50:09] <recurse> but thats ganna load the entire page?
[20:50:15] <recurse> how to use a selector?
[20:50:27] <coldhead> load() loads the entire page
[20:50:32] <coldhead> and then applies the selector
[20:50:36] <coldhead> you can DIY
[20:51:13] <recurse> im sorry im confused. how to have ajax load only that portion of the page like load() with selector?
[20:51:41] <coldhead> $('html').find('the selector you gave to load').appendTo('#some_target');
[20:51:57] <recurse> i guess we're at the "throw shit at the wall and see what sticks" stage
[20:51:57] <coldhead> er
[20:52:04] <coldhead> $(html).find('the selector you gave to load').appendTo('#some_target');
[20:52:15] <coldhead> which is what load() does internally anyway
[20:52:19] <recurse> what happened to ajax?
[20:52:20] <coldhead> it still has to load the whole page
[20:52:24] <coldhead> and find() the bit you care about
[20:52:28] <coldhead> this is inside the ajax handler
[20:52:39] <recurse> ohh
[20:52:42] <coldhead> html is the data passed to the ajax handler
[20:52:42] <recurse> gatcha
[20:52:47] <coldhead> god i hope so
[20:52:49] <recurse> i follow now
[20:52:52] <recurse> lol yes yes
[20:52:58] <recurse> i have high comprehension
[20:53:01] <recurse> =)
[20:53:08] <recurse> i learn quick also
[20:53:16] <coldhead> TWO LIBRANS
[20:53:19] <coldhead> good work
[20:53:23] <coldhead> best of luck!
[20:57:08] <malibu> Thanks IRC friends... it was because I didn't register the click after the child divs were created
[20:57:25] <coldhead> great work malibu
[20:57:28] <coldhead> take five
[20:57:45] <NYCLoki> Hi all, I was wondering if someone could tell me why my attempt at disabling a form element has failed
[20:57:47] <NYCLoki> http://pastebin.com/j8BaHqNf
[20:58:03] <NYCLoki> I thought I've done it just as the faq entry showed
[20:58:44] <NYCLoki> sigh, please disregard that
[20:58:52] <NYCLoki> i mixed up my variable names, i'm an idiot
[20:59:03] <coldhead> great job NYCLoki
[20:59:06] <coldhead> why don't you take five
[20:59:16] <NYCLoki> wait a sec
[20:59:20] <recurse> woot woot NYC!
[20:59:23] <NYCLoki> i didn't
[20:59:24] <recurse> Queens here!
[20:59:31] <NYCLoki> Brooklyn :)
[20:59:49] <recurse> The big rusty Bowl they built looks like shit
[20:59:54] <recurse> =)~
[21:00:00] <coldhead> *** aaaas (~aaas@ool-18bf6656.dyn.optonline.net) is now known as aaas
[21:00:08] <recurse> i hope the Nets do better then their new home looks
[21:00:10] <recurse> haha
[21:00:18] <NYCLoki> I've got radio buttons called roomtype, and clicking on 2 of them should disable the roomtype dropdown
[21:00:20] <NYCLoki> but no luck
[21:00:31] <NYCLoki> recurse: I'm actually from Australia and just moved here
[21:00:39] <NYCLoki> so not too sure what you're talking about
[21:00:52] <recurse> what a coincidence, so is coldhead
[21:01:24] <recurse> Well, the New Jersey Nets (basketball team) was recently purchased by Jay-Z (rap guy) among others .. they moved them to Brooklyn
[21:01:26] <coldhead> it's too small a planet
[21:01:44] <recurse> they built a new stadium
[21:01:46] <NYCLoki> indeed it is
[21:01:52] <NYCLoki> oh yeah I heard about that
[21:01:55] <recurse> the stadium is covered in this special iron thats supposed to rust
[21:02:07] <recurse> but it looks like ... well ... rusty shit
[21:02:11] <NYCLoki> lol
[21:02:13] <recurse> heh
[21:02:28] <recurse> anyway, i hope they do well
[21:02:34] <recurse> cuase the fuckin Knicks sucks balls
[21:02:44] <recurse> (thats our other basketball team)
[21:03:00] <NYCLoki> I know the knicks actually
[21:03:05] <coldhead> personally?
[21:03:06] <NYCLoki> they are pretty famous
[21:03:09] <recurse> kinda like our Mets (baseball team that sucks nuts) ... oppsed to our team the yankees
[21:03:35] <NYCLoki> anyway, would either of you gents have an idea why my attempt to disable a form element is failing?
[21:03:55] <recurse> They built a nice new stadium for the mets ... called city feild ... now its renamed shitty feild ... becuase the Mets are shitty ...
[21:04:09] <recurse> Citi* actually (like citibank)
[21:04:25] <recurse> Shitty* actually (cuase they're shitty)
[21:04:29] <recurse> sorry
[21:04:33] <coldhead> NYCLoki: link?
[21:04:34] <recurse> he needs help!
[21:04:44] <NYCLoki> http://pastebin.com/j8BaHqNf
[21:04:58] <recurse> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/HAk4SiGU
[21:05:06] <recurse> thats what i tried ... does nadda
[21:05:47] <coldhead> oh god
[21:05:51] <coldhead> you can't use onclick anymore
[21:05:58] <NYCLoki> oh
[21:05:59] <NYCLoki> ok
[21:06:02] <coldhead> that's from the 1970s
[21:06:05] <NYCLoki> well it's still in the jquery faq
[21:06:13] <MrMister> anyone know how to prevent teh default link behavior from happening on links that are binded to click?
[21:06:25] <NYCLoki> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_disable.2Fenable_a_form_element.3F
[21:06:30] <NYCLoki> that's the method they suggest
[21:06:56] <recurse> it actually lods
[21:07:03] <recurse> loads* .. im getting a 200ok
[21:07:18] <recurse> but not into the selector we selecting by selecting
[21:07:25] <recurse> selected*
[21:08:45] <recurse>  oh
[21:08:47] <recurse> im silly
[21:08:59] <recurse> silly stoned and fatigued
[21:09:12] <recurse> and not the army kind
[21:09:27] <NYCLoki> coldhead: If the faq is wrong and I shouldn't be using onclick, what should I use instead?
[21:13:37] <coldhead> NYCLoki: http://jsfiddle.net/gvgdg/
[21:13:47] <recurse> 	jQuery.ajax(path + '?cols=3', function (html) {
[21:13:49] <recurse> 	jQuery(html).find('.prodListingTable').appendTo('.prodListingTable');
[21:13:51] <recurse> 	jQuery(this).removeClass("gridtoList");
[21:13:53] <recurse> 	});
[21:13:54] <recurse> akk
[21:13:56] <recurse> sorry
[21:14:02] <recurse> but since we're here
[21:14:11] <recurse> that doesnt load the contents into the selector
[21:14:32] <recurse> but it also doesnt cuase the popups to stop workingh
[21:14:41] <recurse> which is prob becuase it never swaps them out
[21:14:54] <coldhead> recurse: i would try console.log(jQuery(html), jQUery(html).find('.prodListingTable'))
[21:14:59] <coldhead> to see what's actually getting through
[21:15:22] <recurse> do you run firebug ?
[21:15:31] <coldhead> when necessary
[21:15:35] <recurse> they have this very nifty console
[21:15:52] <recurse> activate it, in inside the response you can expand and view returned html etc
[21:16:19] <recurse> seems in this case, the entire page is returned, but perhaps we arent selecting and inserting into selction properly?
[21:16:21] <coldhead> i know
[21:16:28] <coldhead> that's why the console.log()
[21:16:32] <coldhead> so you can see what JS can see
[21:16:35] <NYCLoki> thanks coldhead
[21:16:44] <coldhead> as opposed to what you can find with your peepers
[21:16:53] <coldhead> most welcome NYCLoki
[21:17:17] <recurse> alright i added it
[21:17:21] <recurse> testing now
[21:21:19] <recurse> sorry not sure what im supposed to be seeinf additional with this console.log()
[21:22:45] <recurse> oh
[21:22:47] <recurse> html is not defined
[21:23:12] <recurse> maybe becuase i used outside
[21:23:18] <coldhead> do you pass it to the function in your ajax call?
[21:23:28] <recurse> 	jQuery.ajax(path + '?cols=1', function (html) {
[21:23:29] <recurse> 	jQuery(html).find('.prodListingTable').appendTo('.prodListingTable');
[21:23:30] <coldhead> .ajax('some_url, function (html) {... <-- there ?
[21:23:31] <recurse> 	jQuery(this).addClass("gridtoList");
[21:23:33] <recurse> 	});
[21:23:35] <recurse> 	console.log(jQuery(html), jQuery(html).find('.prodListingTable'));
[21:23:35] <coldhead> yeah that loooks good
[21:24:08] <coldhead> so for some reason your ajax method thinks it's not getting any data
[21:24:16] <coldhead> try adding dataType: 'html'
[21:24:22] <coldhead> as an option
[21:24:26] <coldhead> as shown in the docs
[21:24:42] <recurse> and the error i got in the console was (anonymous function)
[21:24:55] <coldhead> wat
[21:24:55] <b-ot> you actually understand jquery code?  You are on the same level as John Resig????
[21:24:56] <recurse> html is not defined
[21:25:15] <coldhead> >: |
[21:25:31] <recurse> what did i do wrong?
[21:25:44] <coldhead> nothing that i can tell!
[21:26:13] <coldhead> i suppose you'd better paste your code somewhere
[21:26:27] <coldhead> if html is undefined then the success handler shouldn't even run
[21:27:45] <recurse> whats about context:?
[21:28:07] <recurse> . By default, the context is an object that represents the ajax settings used in the call ($.ajaxSettings merged with the settings passed to $.ajax). For example, specifying a DOM element as the context will make that the context for the complete callback of a request
[21:28:22] <coldhead> i don't know anything about that
[21:28:30] <recurse> context: document.body
[21:28:47] <recurse> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:29:39] <coldhead> yeah, it's not obvious to me how that would help
[21:30:34] <recurse> maybe param two in ajax() needed to be specified
[21:30:39] <recurse> thats why the error
[21:30:49] <recurse> in your example, param two was function(html)
[21:30:58] <recurse> adding dataType: "html" as param two
[21:31:18] <coldhead> do it like this
[21:31:51] <coldhead> $.ajax('some_url', {dataType: 'html', success: function () { /* ur function here */ } });
[21:34:30] <coldhead> fml
[21:34:41] <recurse> 	jQuery.ajax(path + '?cols=1', {dataType: 'html', success: function () {
[21:34:43] <recurse> 	jQuery(this).find('.prodListingTable').appendTo('.prodListingTable');
[21:34:44] <recurse> 	jQuery(this).addClass("gridtoList");
[21:34:46] <recurse> 	}
[21:34:48] <recurse> 	})
[21:35:02] <recurse> i changd the second line from (html) to (this)
[21:36:00] <coldhead> er
[21:36:05] <coldhead> that won't do what you want
[21:36:12] <coldhead> this === XHR object
[21:36:16] <coldhead> inside .ajax()
[21:36:41] <recurse> whats is proper replacement for jQuery(html).find('.prodListingTable').appendTo('.prodListingTable');  ?
[21:42:27] <recurse> well it's pushing 1am my time ... ganna hit the hay and circle back to this tomorrow. I appreciate your valuable time coldhead.
[21:45:22] <coldhead> recurse: $(html) does what you want
[21:45:27] <coldhead> there is no need for replacement
[21:45:33] <coldhead> good luck with this monster recurse !
[21:45:40] <coldhead> hopefully it's sorted before i am online again
[21:45:44] <coldhead> so i can move on with my life
[22:26:56] <devslash> has anyone here used JSON to call a PHP script ? I'm having a problem where my code does not appear to be received on the PHP side (which I've determined by dumping the value on the server side)
[22:28:38] <Cork> devslash: you mean you're trying to send php through json for the server to execute?!?
[22:28:45] <devslash> no
[22:29:00] <Cork> what code is it you're tying to send then?
[22:29:03] <devslash> I'm trying to send a string from jquery (client side) to php using a post request
[22:29:17] <devslash> so that the php code can insert it into a database
[22:29:17] <Cork> ok, so you're just sending json data not code
[22:29:27] <devslash> yea
[22:29:35] <Cork> ?p
[22:29:36] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:29:42] <devslash> http://pastebin.com/C5CSeffd
[22:29:56] <devslash> theres the client side code
[22:30:22] <Cork> you can't just give ajax the json string
[22:30:29] <Cork> data is params
[22:30:30] <devslash> how
[22:30:38] <Cork> so you need a variable to carry the json
[22:30:52] <devslash> i don't understand what you mean
[22:30:55] <Cork> ex data: { json: server_str }
[22:31:31] <devslash> ok
[22:31:34] <devslash> so i changed that code
[22:31:45] <Cork> then you will get $_POST['json'] on the server side
[22:31:49] <devslash> on the server side , i output the string which I'm trying to view in firebug
[22:31:56] <devslash> yea thats what I'm doing
[22:32:16] <devslash> on the php side I'm doing this: echo "it is " . $_POST['json'];
[22:32:26] <devslash> just for the sake of debugging
[22:32:44] <devslash> firebug shows this: it is
[22:33:18] <Cork> if you check firebugs net tab
[22:33:30] <Cork> you should see the post there, and what data it sends
[22:33:40] <devslash> theres no data there
[22:33:51] <Cork> so server_str is empty
[22:33:59] <devslash> no
[22:34:06] <devslash> I'm debugging it in fireboxes debugger
[22:34:17] <devslash> it does contain the JSON string
[22:34:58] <devslash> can i pm you the link to my site
[22:35:49] <Cork> devslash: http://jsfiddle.net/f7NYy/
[22:36:14] <devslash> that displays an error
[22:36:34] <Cork> and the updated one http://jsfiddle.net/f7NYy/1/
[22:36:42] <Cork> devslash: sure, the url doesn't exist
[22:36:53] <devslash> thats what i am doing
[22:36:55] <Cork> but if you check in firebug you will see 'json	{"a":10,"b":"works"}'
[22:37:08] <Cork> and the source json=%7B%22a%22%3A10%2C%22b%22%3A%22works%22%7D
[22:37:10] <devslash> can i give you the link
[22:37:20] <Cork> the js works
[22:37:20] <devslash> i don't see that info in firebug
[22:37:26] <Cork> i can't do anything with a link
[22:37:29] <Cork> the problem is server side
[22:37:51] <devslash> then why am i dumping the variable server side and its coming up empty
[22:37:52] <Cork> or your server_str is broken
[22:38:20] <Cork> debug dump the the server_str before you send it to $.ajax
[22:38:48] <Cork> and if its not sensitive pb it (or replace the sensitive data)
[22:39:06] <devslash> what do you mean sensitive pb
[22:39:18] <Cork> pb == pastebin
[22:39:31] <Cork> by sensitive i meant the content of the json
[22:39:52] <devslash> it appears to be ok
[22:40:59] <Cork> i need to see its structure ( i don't care about the values, but i need the structure
[22:41:12] <devslash> ok one sec
[22:42:50] <devslash> im stuck
[22:43:24] <devslash> now I'm getting a 500 error in firebug
[22:44:59] <devslash> can you help me out
[22:45:19] <Cork> not without the json string
[22:45:50] <devslash> i think the problem is server side
[22:46:03] <Cork> that would be ##php then
[22:48:11] <coldhead> great job everyone, let's all take five
[22:48:54] <coldhead> hey subbyyy
[22:49:07] <subbyyy> =o
[22:50:14] <devslash> Cork: I'm not sure though
[22:50:26] <devslash> i don't know if maybe its the iso string that gets sent thats bad
[22:50:29] <devslash> its one of the 2
[22:50:38] <devslash> json string
[22:50:57] <devslash> Cork: did you see the JSON string that I sent you ?
[22:51:10] <Cork> nope
[22:51:37] <devslash> http://pastebin.com/QuQywmSH
[22:52:51] <Cork> devslash: ya, that should work
[22:53:00] <Cork> its dubble encoded though, but...
[22:53:08] <devslash> I'm getting a 500 error when i display the value of that json string after decoding it on the php side
[22:53:35] <devslash> you mean as if JSON.stringify was called on it twice ?
[22:53:47] <Cork> almost
[22:54:08] <Cork> you have a javascript object stringified in PlaylistContent0
[22:54:14] <Cork> its not json though
[22:54:28] <Cork> and that will be a bit sucky to handle server side
[22:54:32] <devslash> i decided that i wanted the data in that format
[22:54:37] <Cork> but beside that it should work fine
[22:54:46] <devslash> i wrote a for loop to parse it on the server side
[22:54:53] <Cork> and that's a console.log(server_str) =
[22:54:55] <Cork> *?
[22:55:16] <Cork> (after you ran JSON.stringify
[22:55:18] <Cork> )
[22:55:37] <devslash> yes
[22:56:11] <Cork> and you're posting it as data: { json: server_str }, ?
[22:56:26] <devslash> yes
[22:56:49] <Cork> is this happening in a event handler or something like that?
[22:56:59] <devslash> yea
[22:57:04] <Cork> heh
[22:57:07] <devslash> when you click on a save menu item
[22:57:17] <devslash> it asks you for the name then makes the ajax call
[22:57:20] <Cork> are you doing var server_str; somewhere in that event handler?
[22:57:21] <devslash> why does that matter ?
[22:57:31] <Cork> ^ thats why
[22:57:35] <devslash> yes
[22:57:40] <devslash> var server_str =  {};
[22:57:45] <Cork> ok, then ya, only thing left is server side
[22:59:08] <devslash> it worked until i changed it from get to post
[22:59:25] <Cork> so the server might expect $_GET not $_POST
[23:00:06] <devslash> i changed one line which was $decoded = json_decode($_GET['json']); to $decoded = json_decode($_POST['json']);
[23:01:27] <Cork> devslash: check var_dump($_REQUEST);
[23:01:50] <devslash> why $_REQUEST ?
[23:02:01] <Cork> cause that catches any form of request
[23:02:11] <Cork> post get or any other form
[23:02:44] <devslash> firebug shows this:
[23:02:46] <devslash> array(1) {
[23:02:47] <devslash>   ["json"]=>
[23:02:48] <devslash>   string(430) "{"PlaylistName0":"Jazz","PlaylistContent0":"%22%7B'Music%20-%20Ginza%20Samba'%3A'Vince%20Guaraldi%2FGinza%20Samba.mp3'%2C'Thelonious%20Monk%20-%20Blues%20Five%20Spot%20(Live)'%3A'Thelonious%20Monk%2FLive%20At%20The%20It%20Club%20(Disc%201)%2F05%20Blues%20Five%20Spot%20(Live).mp3'%2C'Thelonious%20Monk%20-%20Monk's%20Dream%20%5BTake%208%5D'%3A'Thelonious%20Monk%2FMonk's%20Dream%2F01%20Monk's%20Dream%20%5BTake%208%5D.mp3'%7D%22"}"
[23:02:49] <devslash> }
[23:02:59] <devslash> but doesn't specify get or post
[23:03:15] <Cork> ya, next is testing $_GET and $_POST separatly
[23:03:20] <danmichel> Ok, maybe I've been going about this the wrong way. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction as to what I should be Googling to accomplish either loading the second and third images in my slider only after the page has fully loaded.
[23:03:23] <Cork> but don't dump it in the channel
[23:03:29] <devslash> oh sorry
[23:03:32] <danmichel> Another option would be not to load anything in the div containing the slider at all until the page has fully loaded and the images within that div have fully loaded. I tried LazyLoad for the slider images before, but it only conflicted with the slider's 'slide left' effect http://varmag.com/ . Thanks in advance for any help
[23:03:42] <devslash> do you mean dumping get and post for the json variable
[23:04:39] <Cork> devslash: echo 'GET: \n'; var_dump($_GET); echo '\n\nPOST:\n'; var_dump($_POST);
[23:05:41] <devslash> I'm seeing the data when dumping $_POST
[23:06:13] <Cork> devslash: and var_dump($_POST['json']); is empty??
[23:07:08] <devslash> now its showing this: http://pastebin.com/b0TchYCr
[23:07:19] <Cork> thats better
[23:07:32] <devslash> but
[23:07:41] <Cork> var_dump(json_decode($_POST['json']))
[23:08:38] <devslash> http://pastebin.com/77cYdCk2
[23:08:56] <devslash> weird
[23:09:05] <devslash> its almost as if it is double encoded
[23:09:13] <Cork> nope
[23:09:29] <Cork> $json = json_decode($_POST['json']); var_dump($json['playlistName0']); should work
[23:09:42] <Cork> you should get string(4) "Jazz"
[23:10:37] <devslash> nope
[23:10:40] <devslash> i get a 500 error
[23:10:50] <Cork> O_o
[23:11:08] <Cork> what does the error log say?
[23:11:22] <Cork> (though this is getting way off topic)
[23:11:30] <devslash> 500 internal server error
[23:11:47] <Cork> no the error log should be more specific
[23:12:04] <Cork> it should pinpoint what caused the server to fail
[23:12:20] <Cork> devslash: anyway you need to take this in $json
[23:12:23] <Cork> bah...
[23:12:27] <Cork> i meant in ##php
[23:12:42] <Cork> the data is sent to the server, and its verified that it's getting there
[23:12:47] <devslash> ok
[23:12:52] <devslash> so its definitely server sider
[23:12:54] <devslash> side
[23:12:57] <Cork> the rest is too off topic for this channel
[23:13:00] <Cork> yes
[23:13:05] <devslash> ok thanks for the help
[23:13:10] <Cork> np
[23:16:05] <adamholwerda> Wouldn't it be cool if you could combine jQuery and Emmet and do something like $('#nav>ul.list>li.item*5').appendTo('body'); ?
[23:17:35] <coldhead> how would jQuery know that was a line for constructing html and not a selecotr, adamholwerda
[23:17:44] <coldhead> selector*
[23:19:08] <coldhead> it might be cool to have a new function $$ that took an emmet line and returned a jQuery object. then you could go $$('#nav>ul.list>li.item*5').appendTo('body');
[23:19:14] <coldhead> and it wouldn't be jquery's problem
[23:19:19] <coldhead> feel free to implement that
[23:19:50] <adamholwerda> Yeah, okay. I was also thinking it would select that group if it found a match.
[23:20:57] <adamholwerda> if you had <div id = "nav><ul><li class = "list"></li><li class = "list"></li><li class = "list"></li><li class = "list"></li></ul></div> in the DOM it would return that as your selection.
[23:20:59] <coldhead> innnteresting
[23:21:35] <adamholwerda> So would it have to know the difference? It just needs the Emmet engine to parse the string
[23:22:02] <Haprog> I would imagine that kind of selection would be relatively expensive compared to just using simple selections with appropriate id and class names.
[23:22:11] <coldhead> it would need to search the dom for the selector first and then maybe create the html
[23:22:21] <coldhead> i still think it would be better as a different function
[23:22:27] <coldhead> selection and creation are different things
[23:22:51] <adamholwerda> jQuery does both with the same syntax so I'd want to keep that
[23:23:00] <Haprog> no it doesn
[23:23:04] <Haprog> not same syntax
[23:23:25] <adamholwerda> $('<div />') kinda like $('div')
[23:23:40] <Haprog> you see the <element/>. different syntax
[23:23:41] <coldhead> they're similar but the do different things
[23:23:51] <coldhead> $('<div />') always creates something new
[23:24:03] <coldhead> $('div') always selects
[23:24:22] <adamholwerda> okay so I'd probably have to do something else with the creation one...hmm
[23:24:35] <adamholwerda> or rather the selection one
[23:24:50] <adamholwerda> since Emmet is for creation mostly
[23:25:26] <coldhead> that's why i think $$ would be better
[23:25:32] <coldhead> you could always use $$ to create
[23:25:34] <coldhead> and $ to select
[23:25:43] <Haprog> $$$$
[23:25:50] <coldhead> also people won't moan about jQuery having A FURTHER SIGNATURE
[23:25:51] <Haprog> :P
[23:26:39] <adamholwerda> Yeah cool. And it would probably be expensive, but I would love to play around with something that did that
[23:26:52] <Cork> adamholwerda: wouldn't that be something similar to  $('#nav>ul.list>li.item').slice(5).appendTo('body'); ?
[23:28:36] <joobie> guys looking at the very last example on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6835835/jquery-simple-polling-example .. how would you actually call the poll() function to start it? I tried poll() but that didnt work
[23:29:48] <adamholwerda> @Cork I don't think that works
[23:30:38] <Cork> ah, its the opposite
[23:30:48] <Cork> adamholwerda:  $('#nav>ul.list>li.item').slice(0, 5).appendTo('body'); ?
[23:31:03] <Cork> that should grab the fist 5 elements and append them to body
[23:31:17] <Cork> ?.slice
[23:31:18] <bot-t> .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[23:34:23] <adamholwerda> I'm not trying to get it to work because I know it doesn't - was just pondering functionality nobody would probably want - i.e. an Emmet string being used as a jQuery element creator
[23:35:19] <adamholwerda> @joobie Check out Ben Alman's doTimeout plugin
[23:36:55] <adamholwerda> I use it in a lot of projects where I'm polling, debouncing, hover-intenting and stuff like that
[23:37:49] <joobie> adamholwerda, does it have protection to stop it running whilst it is already running?
[23:38:21] <devslash> Cork: are you still around ?
[23:38:25] <Cork> sure
[23:38:33] <devslash> i fixed the problem
[23:38:49] <Cork> nice
[23:38:49] <devslash> there were 2 problems that I fixed on the server side
[23:38:59] <adamholwerda> Yeah you can force or quit the poll
[23:39:35] <joobie> adamholwerda, that other example wont actually run the poll if there's another running whcih is kinda neat
[23:39:44] <adamholwerda> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[23:45:16] <joobie> adamholwerda, how would i call poll() in that sample?
[23:45:19] <joobie> like to start it..
[23:45:29] <joobie> that example is pretty complex for me to grasp :P
[23:46:19] <adamholwerda> well you're not really calling "poll()" you're setting up a function that polls
[23:46:27] <anli> I would like to have a button with a 3x3 design on web browsers that supports multiple backgrounds on an element and in other browsers, just a vanilla button, is that possible?
[23:46:44] <anli> Without flickering
[23:48:05] <adamholwerda> $.doTimeout( 'someid', 100, function(){
[23:48:05] <adamholwerda> if ( some_condition ) {
[23:48:05] <adamholwerda> return false;
[23:48:06] <adamholwerda> }
[23:48:08] <adamholwerda> return true;
[23:48:10] <adamholwerda> });
[23:48:12] <adamholwerda> sorry - something like that
[23:51:30] <joobie> hmm this is werid
[23:51:57] <joobie> http://pastebin.com/vKRAPPwq - i'm not getting the alert back
[23:52:16] <joobie> i looked at livehttpheaders, and i can see that feed.php is being called every 5 seconds, but no alert..
[23:52:23] <joobie> I get a 200 response for the feed.php call
[23:52:28] <joobie> any ideas?
[23:52:46] <joobie> .. I was expecting to see a alert box wiht test in it every 5 seconds
[23:53:46] <jrockjiggz> is it possible in chrome to save a browser post request, and repeat it? (to save time from re-filling out a form and submitting)
[23:55:59] <adamholwerda> it's polling though
[23:56:35] <joobie> yea
[23:56:36] <adamholwerda> dev tools is showing your xhr returning every 5 seconds. not sure why no alert but meh
[23:56:39] <joobie> polling is working OK now
[23:56:58] <joobie> I actually just did a tcpdump and I can see that the php script it's polling is also echo'ing back correctly (just 1 line of text)
[23:57:09] <joobie> i've converted the dataType to 'script', but still not getting the alert box
[23:57:48] <adamholwerda> haha i hope that's not your use case
[23:58:08] <joobie> what do you mean adamholwerda ?
[23:58:40] <adamholwerda> to alert something every 5 seconds
[23:58:42] <joobie> http://pastebin.com/eMJGBTUC - this is the latest version i'm using
[23:58:44] <joobie> ohh
[23:58:45] <joobie> no
[23:58:45] <joobie> :)
[23:59:00] <joobie> just for testing.. but have a look at http://pastebin.com/eMJGBTUC .. that still doesn't work
[23:59:15] <joobie> I can see the poll is working and I can see taht the php script is returning just some text, but i dont get the alert popup
[23:59:35] <adamholwerda> what happens if you put the alert inside the complete
[23:59:46] <adamholwerda> you have success and complete
