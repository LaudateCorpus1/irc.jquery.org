[00:03:48] <Xgear> Sorry for the delay: http://jsfiddle.net/P27jZ/
[00:04:30] <Eviltwin> So is there a reason for the two different calls?
[00:04:38] <Xgear> The form response/form request is being received/sent after the #testbtn event.
[00:04:43] <Eviltwin> And why one's triggered by the button whereas the other is triggered by the form?
[00:04:45] <Xgear> I need the button to run before the form one
[00:05:00] <Xgear> I have a default ajax query that runs for every form
[00:05:08] <Xgear> And a specific one for the button.
[00:05:16] <Xgear> *for this button*
[00:06:22] <Xgear> So having the form going after the button, renders the button ajax delayed by one event.
[00:07:52] <chkpnt> Eviltwin: Thanks!
[00:07:59] <Xgear> So not sure if its possible to send some sort of priority for the requests or what not.
[00:08:50] <Xgear> Kinda want to avoid having to add a check for the form tag to see if its the form of this button and then setting some code after the ajax call for the button triggers success
[00:09:19] <Eviltwin> If you preventDefault() on the button click it'll stop the form handler from firing
[00:09:51] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/P27jZ/1/
[00:10:10] <Xgear> I guess that makes it a little less annoying
[00:10:15] <Xgear> No other way around?
[00:12:43] <Xgear> Alright, that seems to do the trick.
[00:12:50] <Xgear> Wasnt so terrible :P
[00:12:54] <Xgear> Thanks a lot Eviltwin
[00:13:12] <Eviltwin> You could also try something like this with deferreds: http://jsfiddle.net/P27jZ/2/
[00:14:49] <Eviltwin> With delays: http://jsfiddle.net/P27jZ/3/
[00:15:21] <Eviltwin> async: false is a bad idea, don't use it
[00:15:51] <Xgear> Yeah, was just trying to see if that'd help me stop the request's order
[00:16:04] <Xgear> At first I thought submit would have a higher priority than clicking button
[00:16:11] <Xgear> But it makes more sense that button triggers before submit
[00:16:26] <Xgear> Forgot to remove it when copying the ajax request :P
[00:16:48] <Xgear> Deferreds seems like a good option. Delays not so much.
[00:16:56] <Xgear> Thanks a lot though!
[00:18:54] <Eviltwin> Oh, the delay's just there to show you that if the request takes time it still waits for it to finish
[00:19:10] <Eviltwin> It's a feature of /echo/json/
[00:40:17] <azureKnight> Hi, I had a quick question. I'm still trying to get the hang of jquery, but I'm confused why this statement isn't working
[00:40:19] <azureKnight> var $c = $(this).css('background-color');
[00:43:55] <jert> How can trigger event when loaded span.  http://jsbin.com/emoquy/1/edit
[00:44:01] <Eviltwin> azureKnight: http://jsfiddle.net/j8Dk5/
[00:45:00] <azureKnight> Eviltwin I see. I'm trying to use it so that I can make a div detect if that class has some sort of margin, then use css accordingly.
[00:45:42] <azureKnight> Whenever I write $(this).css(); in a var, all the other jquery just dies… lol.
[00:45:52] <Eviltwin> So... .css('background-color') is working...
[00:46:06] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ azureKnight
[00:46:07] <b-ot> azureKnight: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:46:07] <bot-t> azureKnight, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:46:40] <azureKnight> http://codepen.io/azureknight/collab/iuEFB
[00:47:40] <Eviltwin> Uh this isn't working for me
[00:47:46] <Eviltwin> Can you just dump this into jsFiddle and link me?
[00:47:51] <azureKnight> Sure. I'll do that now.
[00:52:01] <azureKnight> Eviltwin
[00:52:02] <azureKnight> http://jsfiddle.net/CRXaS/
[00:54:31] <Eviltwin> azureKnight: What is "this" supposed to be there?
[00:54:52] <Eviltwin> What element do you want the hieght and background of?
[00:54:57] <Eviltwin> height*
[00:54:58] <azureKnight> The idea is that it will return a property of the css, then I'll be able to control an if statement.
[00:55:11] <azureKnight> Background was just used to show css wasn't working with tied to a var with $(this) in front of it.
[00:55:34] <azureKnight> Though, I suppose I could try the same idea with outerWidth.
[00:55:41] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/CRXaS/3/
[00:55:44] <Eviltwin> It works if you select a valid element
[00:56:22] <Eviltwin> You may want to read http://jqfundamentals.com and learn more about when you should and shouldn't use "this"
[00:57:04] <azureKnight> Yeah, I understand that. I was doing it because the "this" needed to apply to the middle item specifically.
[00:57:11] <azureKnight> But, I'll look into wrapping my head around it a bit more. Thanks.
[00:59:54] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure how you think $(this) will apply to the middle item but okay
[01:13:01] <stygyan> guys, guys. just some help. anyone knows of a jquery slider that slides just one image from left to right and viceversa?
[01:13:59] <Cork> stygyan: why not just use animate if you just want to animate an image?
[01:14:29] <stygyan> i'm afraid i have to learn something more about jquery than just using plugins
[01:15:05] <Eviltwin> Yes, that sounds like a good idea
[01:15:15] <stygyan> yeah, sounds like it.
[01:15:29] <stygyan> i'm going to use the still image for now until i finish the general layout and then will work on that
[01:15:48] <stygyan> mostly i want to keep a panorama going right and left all the time
[01:16:58] <Cork> stygyan: something like animate({ left: -(imagewith) }, 1000); animate({ left: $(window).width() }, 1000) is all you need
[01:17:05] <stygyan> thank you Cork
[01:17:14] <Cork> (with some bounding and delays and so on)
[01:17:23] <Cork> depending on how you want it to look
[01:18:01] <Cork> uh, *bouncing
[01:19:15] <huglester> Guys, I can trigger click on ckeditor (externaly). but then the ckeditor is hidden, I can't... any way aroudn this?
[01:20:45] <huglester> even if I remove 'display none' via firebug, and press my external button  - it triggers the toolbar button and I get a ckeditor popup
[01:21:11] <huglester> Tried few options, but seems my knowledge of ckeditor/javasciprt is very low here
[01:25:08] <Eviltwin> huglester: This sounds like a CKEditor issue, not a jQuery issue
[01:25:19] <Eviltwin> huglester: I suggest checking out http://docs.cksource.com/Main_Page or http://ckeditor.com/forums
[01:26:16] <huglester> Eviltwin: thanks. just thought maybe someone here was using ckeditor and has some experience
[01:29:30] <jert> jQuery can't bind event to AJAX loaded element  http://jsbin.com/emoquy/1/edit
[01:30:26] <Eviltwin> jert: Please resolve the 3 warnings in the JavaScript console before making accusations about what jQuery can't do
[01:36:35] <jert> in the new row, i can't bind the eventhandler
[01:37:09] <Eviltwin> You absolutely can bind an event handler
[01:38:35] <jert> yes, i tried already the method on() and  live(). but i didn't arrived.
[01:40:08] <Eviltwin> jert: http://jsfiddle.net/EzDtx/
[01:40:46] <Eviltwin> Or alternatively: http://jsfiddle.net/EzDtx/1/
[01:51:27] <jert> i have to put the eventhandler in the success, it's possible to replace a  element and bind the eventhandler with a method live() or on()
[01:54:28] <jert> i like use my existing event
[02:05:08] <Cork> jert: did you use the correct syntax for on/delegate?
[02:05:47] <Cork> jert: you can't use the same syntax as for live, as that would kill the point of depricating live; the problem with live was namely it's broken syntax
[02:06:12] <Eviltwin> I thought the problem with live was the method name
[02:12:57] <stygyan> Eviltwin, Cork, i made it without using jquery.
[02:13:26] <Cork> stygyan: css3?
[02:13:30] <stygyan> yeah
[02:13:37] <stygyan> realized it would be easier
[02:13:43] <Cork> remember that ie < 10 doesn't support that
[02:13:51] <stygyan> yup, i know.
[02:14:09] <stygyan> it's just an aesthetic thing, though, so nothing much would be lost
[02:18:12] <jert> i want change Elements with replaceWith(), and bind the same eventhandler like the other rows in the Table
[02:20:29] <Cork> jert: ok?

[02:26:45] <FilipNortic> Is there a way to make .scrolleft() go to max? something with window.width()?
[02:27:08] <Cork> jert: you made a statement, so i wasn't sure what you meant; that was what i meant by "ok?"
[02:27:09] <Eviltwin> .scrollLeft(window.width()) perhaps?
[02:27:20] <Eviltwin> Well .scrollLeft($(window).width())
[02:27:34] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ jert
[02:27:34] <b-ot> jert: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[02:27:35] <Cork> won't that just scroll the viewport width?
[02:28:05] <Eviltwin> .scrollLeft($(document).width()) perhaps
[02:28:19] <Eviltwin> I shouldn't be up this late
[02:28:34] <Cork> i THINK document.documentElement.scrollWidth is what you're looking for
[02:30:57] <FilipNortic> Cork: .scrollLeft($(window).width()) seams to work is there any benefits with the document solution?
[02:31:42] <yousaf> any freelancing jquery/css ninjas around?
[02:32:49] <Cork> FilipNortic: i'm not sure if window width will actually give you the entire scroll length
[02:33:11] <Cork> FilipNortic: but window and document is so special that you can't always know what the different values are on them
[02:33:33] <Cork> i usually end up having to test it in all the browser before trusting what i see
[02:33:57] <Cork> (and yes i mean ALL, desktop, mobile and so on)
[02:40:04] <AjitS> I am new with jQuery. Is there a concept similar to static variables in jQuery?
[02:40:12] <Cork> no
[02:40:19] <Cork> and s/jquery/javascript/
[02:40:30] <Cork> iquery is a framework not a language
[02:40:48] <Cork> meaning jquery helps you write javascript, you don't write in jquery
[02:41:56] <AjitS> Cork, Thank you for making  it clear. So is there a way to create static variables in JavaScript?
[02:42:13] <Cork> like i said no
[02:42:21] <magnus__> hey. trying to get rid of all rows in a table, so I do: $('#mytable').children("tr").remove() .. but nothing happens. what am I doing wrong?
[02:42:30] <Cork> you can create const in an up comming version of javascript
[02:42:46] <Cork> but it's going to take quite a while before that can be used on the open web
[02:43:02] <AjitS> Cork, Thank you.
[02:43:10] <Cork> magentar: tr isn't children of the table
[02:43:16] <Cork> magentar: its tbody
[02:43:36] <Cork> magnus__: $('#mytable tbody').empty()
[02:43:51] <magnus__> ah, thanks
[03:03:33] <k_sze[work]> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-focus says that "Canceling this event prevents the value from being updated, but does not prevent the menu item from being focused". What does it mean by "Canceling"?
[03:04:03] <Cork> k_sze[work]: event.preventDefault()
[03:04:13] <k_sze[work]> aaah
[03:04:14] <k_sze[work]> thanks
[03:07:09] <k_sze[work]> Hmm, somehow I still can't get items to be highlighted when I use the keyboard to navigate the autocomplete list.
[03:07:36] <Cork> k_sze[work]: that should work just fine
[03:08:10] <k_sze[work]> Well, I did prevent it from filling in the textbox, but I can't get the item highlighted.
[03:08:32] <k_sze[work]> The autocomplete list would scroll if I press the up/down arrows enough though
[03:08:39] <k_sze[work]> so I know it works in the back.
[03:08:46] <k_sze[work]> I can even press enter to select an item.
[03:08:53] <k_sze[work]> I just can't get it to highlight. XD
[03:09:01] <Cork> k_sze[work]: sounds like you have a problem with you css then
[03:09:06] <Cork> ex. test http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[03:09:13] <k_sze[work]> That's what I think, too.
[03:11:47] <k_sze[work]> Shouldn't this be correct? ul.ui-autocomplete.ui-menu>li.ui-menu-item>a.ui-state-active

[05:20:49] <dhaval2712> So I don't know anything about jquery but I really need it right now.
[05:21:22] <dhaval2712> How can I download only a part of a Remote HTML page, rather than the entire page
[05:22:12] <t_kjaergaard> dhaval2712: You can't just download part.. You have to download it all and then parse the return
[05:22:39] <dhaval2712> So there's no way I can just say "Hey, download only this div and parse it?"
[05:23:02] <dhaval2712> I mean no way as in by no means, not python, javascript, anything?
[05:23:41] <t_kjaergaard> No, unfortunately.. You might want to look at the $.load function..
[05:23:59] <t_kjaergaard> But no, a server side language can't do that for you either..
[05:24:27] <dhaval2712> Thing is, my friend's lost his exam id and you have to download the hall ticket from this server.
[05:24:38] <dhaval2712> Do do so, you need the exam id and the date of birth.
[05:25:17] <dhaval2712> Right now I'm running a python script that just runs through the exam ids, gets the entire page, and sees if his name is in there.
[05:26:32] <t_kjaergaard> No API that you could work with instead?
[05:26:56] <dhaval2712> Like what? I don't really know what to do here.
[05:26:59] <t_kjaergaard> Or a search field you could post some data to?
[05:27:37] <dhaval2712> Nope. All the page has is one field for the exam id, and combo boxes for the dob. They're sent in plaintext with the URL query string.
[05:27:41] <t_kjaergaard> I ask you if the website you're pulling data from has a API that you could interact with instead of HTLM parsing..
[05:27:54] <dhaval2712> Oh god no.
[05:28:07] <dhaval2712> This is, a website that belongs to the Indian Government.
[05:28:15] <dhaval2712> It returns flat html files. That's it.
[05:28:19] <t_kjaergaard> hmm..
[05:28:30] <t_kjaergaard> How often do they change?
[05:28:51] <dhaval2712> I don't know. I think it's just html files stored with an id somewhere.
[05:29:02] <dhaval2712> I don't suppose SQL injection is an option?
[05:29:11] <Anticom> hi all
[05:29:46] <Anticom> is there any way to tell the ui's datepicker where it should append its markup to? (like appendTo option for dialog does)
[05:30:01] <t_kjaergaard> dhaval2712: You could set at script up to fetch all of the data to your own sql database..
[05:30:07] <t_kjaergaard> with node or php..
[05:30:13] <dhaval2712> Oh no I have a date.
[05:30:27] <t_kjaergaard> Then you're are screwed..
[05:30:36] <dhaval2712> Now when you say 'data', you mean just the data or the html files?
[05:30:47] <dhaval2712> which are then sorted into a table?
[05:31:08] <dhaval2712> Still, how would I do that with php?
[05:31:31] <t_kjaergaard> I would get a mySQL database up and running and create a fetch script that putted all data into it, and maybe setup a cron script to revisit the site once a day to look for new entries..
[05:32:10] <t_kjaergaard> dhaval2712: I would only pick out the data that i needed in plain text..
[05:32:13] <dhaval2712> I'm pretty sure they don't update. I think the site is pretty much only for this purpose.
[05:32:32] <t_kjaergaard> Then you can ignore the cron script..
[05:32:34] <dhaval2712> Also, this is a simple URL. I don't know how I can query their database without knowing the name or anything.

[05:36:37] <Anticom> dafuq... thought i was at #jquery...
[05:36:43] <t_kjaergaard> Try search google there must be someone with the same needs as you..
[05:37:33] <dhaval2712> I have. Sadly it seems that downloading the entire html page is the only option right now. What's worse is my complete lack of understanding of jquery makes it difficult to see how I can implement it.
[05:37:49] <t_kjaergaard> Anticom: You.. The conversation has evolved from a Ajax question to python.. :)
[05:38:06] <Anticom> and cronjobs and mysql databases and so on
[05:38:13] <dhaval2712> Not really. Ajax was one of the options. So is all of this.
[05:38:21] <Anticom> don't want to flame. just saying that we should stay on topic here t_kjaergaard ;)
[05:38:33] <Anticom> dhaval2712 what's ur problem?
[05:38:43] <t_kjaergaard> Anticom: Not me that flying around.. I'm just trying to help out..
[05:39:21] <Anticom> however: is there any hack to make the datepicker append its markup to where i want?
[05:39:58] <t_kjaergaard> Well dhaval2712, i'm afraid that Anticom is right.. I can't help you anymore than i already has.. Sorry.. Good luck with your project..
[05:40:14] <Anticom> what does he want to do?
[05:40:18] <Anticom> writing a crawler?
[05:40:21] <dhaval2712> I understand. Anticom: My friend's lost his exam id. To get it, one has to enter the exam id and his d.o.b at a web page, which will give him his admit card in html. So what I'm doing with that python script is just brute forcing it. Trying every exam id and see if his name comes up.
[05:40:59] <dhaval2712> Right now I am looking into the .load() method.
[05:41:05] <Anticom> dhaval2712 you might just tell your buddy to go to the secretary and ask for a new one o.O
[05:41:24] <dhaval2712> He did of course. They said they couldn't do anything.
[05:41:29] <Anticom> dhaval2712 however you can check out pjscrape powered by node.js
[05:41:31] <t_kjaergaard> dhaval2712: For such a complex task, Jquery is properly not what you want..
[05:41:37] <Anticom> i'm not gonna tell you anything more about that
[05:41:43] <t_kjaergaard> I would go server-side..
[05:41:49] <Anticom> t_kjaergaard yep
[05:41:49] <dhaval2712> You've helped quite a bit actually.
[05:41:55] <dhaval2712> THis at least gives me options.
[05:42:10] <Anticom> so back to my datepicker issue :D
[05:42:12] <dhaval2712> Thanks a lot guys.
[05:42:18] <Anticom> cheers
[05:42:25] <t_kjaergaard> I can't help you with that datapick mate, sorry.. :)
[05:42:45] <t_kjaergaard> You're welcome..
[05:42:50] <Cork> dhaval2712: jquery has very little to do with the problem
[05:42:50] <Anticom> i just don't get why there aren't any default options implemented in the widget factory
[05:42:54] <Anticom> that would be the most convinient way
[05:42:59] <Cork> it is a limitation in how js gets networks data
[05:43:04] <Anticom> oh hey Cork :)
[05:43:07] <Cork> o/
[05:43:19] <Cork> dhaval2712: and it is also often a limitation in the webserver
[05:43:37] <Cork> the server is built to send the text response it has when a resource is requested
[05:43:44] <Cork> so it sends the data in the payload
[05:43:48] <Anticom> Cork i need to append the datepicker's markup to a specific node instead of the document's body
[05:43:52] <Cork> unless it has specific code server side to limit it
[05:44:02] <MariusIT> any ideea how to many this work with multiple divs? http://jsfiddle.net/KcX6A/2177/
[05:44:04] <Anticom> are there any "simple" hax or do i need to change, how it's implemented?
[05:44:07] <Cork> Anticom: look in the api page
[05:44:12] <t_kjaergaard> Cork: He's gone..
[05:44:18] <Anticom> Cork there is no such option
[05:44:20] <Cork> there should be a container option or similar
[05:44:43] <Anticom> there is none i'm afraid
[05:44:43] <Cork> t_kjaergaard: no he's still in here
[05:46:07] <Anticom> Cork think i might have to hack the widget itself
[05:46:17] <Cork> shouldn't have to
[05:46:37] <Anticom> i've briefly read the whole API docs like 3 times now
[05:46:52] <Cork> Anticom: one option would be to separate it from the input field
[05:46:56] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline
[05:48:22] <Anticom> Cork that might work
[05:48:50] <Anticom> although it's not really linked to a input[type=text] anymore
[05:48:59] <Anticom> however that doesn't matter for my needs
[05:49:08] <Anticom> as long as it fixes the styling
[05:49:29] <sammich> can't you give an #alt_field for datepickers?
[05:49:46] <sammich> that way it should be able to write the selected value to that input
[05:49:47] <Anticom> yep
[05:50:19] <Anticom> sammich but i also meant the visual attatchment layoutwise (so that it alignes to and follows the input field)
[05:50:51] <sammich> that shouldn't be too hard?
[05:51:09] <sammich> just stick the input right before the datepicker div
[05:51:16] <sammich> or block
[05:51:37] <Cork> Anticom: but ya, it doesn't look like date picker has support for floating specified parent $("body").append(this._dialogInput); is what it uses
[05:51:52] <Cork> Anticom: though that said, have you checked what happens if you just move the dialog?
[05:52:37] <Cork> Anticom: could be written as an extension for datepicker
[05:54:38] <Anticom> wait Cork that's going to fast for my grilled brain :D
[05:55:05] <Anticom> move what dialog and what should happen?
[05:55:26] <Cork> Anticom: when datepicker starts it checks if it has an internal dialog on reference
[05:55:41] <Cork> if it doesn't it creates on and does $("body").append(this._dialogInput);
[05:56:01] <Cork> so it might just be to move that created dialog from body to where you want it; migth work; might not
[05:56:06] <Anticom> so i should set _dialogInput before showing the datepicker the first time?
[05:56:15] <dwarder> i need to init a widget on an element that will be loaded with ajax, how can i do this?
[05:56:18] <Cork> it's just a variable
[05:56:34] <Anticom> dwarder as soon as the loading is done?!
[05:56:56] <Cork> dwarder: you would have to run the widget code in the callback from the load function
[05:57:09] <Anticom> appending it to a div is just fine
[05:57:11] <Cork> like ex $.ajax().done(function() {}) for example
[05:57:14] <dwarder> Anticom: is there something like .on(click  delegate ?
[05:57:23] <Cork> not for widgets no
[05:57:29] <dwarder> i see
[05:57:39] <Cork> on/delegate is only for events
[05:57:45] <Anticom> dwarder for js you most of the time should think in callbacks :)
[05:57:48] <Cork> if you need to modify the element, the element needs to exist
[05:58:25] <dwarder> thank you
[05:59:17] <moldy> can anyone recommend a lightbox plugin that is compatible with jquery1.9+?
[05:59:29] <moldy> i tried several now, without success
[05:59:46] <Cork> moldy: a plain div? :D
[05:59:59] <moldy> Cork: ?
[06:00:16] <sammich> lightboxes are fun to make
[06:00:20] <Cork> moldy: joke a side, what part of lightbox do you neeD?
[06:00:53] <Cork> to my experience for lightbox situations you often don't need much js at all to make them do the job
[06:01:02] <Cork> mostly css is needed
[06:01:12] <moldy> Cork: the overlay stuff. support for image sets would be nice-to-have.
[06:01:41] <Cork> ok, image sets would go beyond the simple set
[06:02:12] <moldy> Cork: the more general question i have is how to properly deal with jquery plugins at large
[06:02:29] <Cork> moldy: though lightbox should support 1.9
[06:02:31] <moldy> it seems that the usually come bundled with their own version of jquery?
[06:02:49] <Cork> uh, no
[06:03:03] <Cork> that's not recommended, and normally a bad idea
[06:03:07] <moldy> every plugin i downloaded so far has stuff like jquery, jquery-ui bundled :)
[06:03:17] <Cork> in the zip package yes
[06:03:22] <Cork> but you don't have to use them
[06:03:29] <moldy> ok
[06:03:33] <Cork> moldy: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/35
[06:03:42] <sammich> they generally include them so you can run them out of the box
[06:03:46] <Cork> so lightbox2 has 1.9 support since then
[06:03:50] <Anticom> moldy you could even modify the jq ui theme and use a hacked jq ui dialog^^
[06:04:01] <Anticom> modal dialog*
[06:04:11] <Cork> dialog is way over the top for what he needs though
[06:04:15] <Cork> and it has no image set needs
[06:04:22] <Anticom> Cork but we're at #jquery :D
[06:04:31] <moldy> Cork: otoh, this means that you have to manually figure out which files you need for each plugin, right?
[06:04:33] <Cork> * has no image set support
[06:04:51] <Anticom> wasn't meant seriously anyway... just saying that it was possible
[06:04:57] <moldy> there is no such thing as "package management", right?
[06:05:08] <Cork> moldy: not really, it's normally just jquery.pluginname[.min].js
[06:05:09] <sammich> put all the images in a single sprite file
[06:05:11] <Anticom> modly like require.js?
[06:05:22] <Anticom> oh nvm
[06:05:39] <moldy> Anticom: as you might have guessed, i don't know that much about the js ecosystem :)
[06:05:48] <moldy> i'm a backend guy most of the time
[06:06:01] <sammich> node.js is backend ;)
[06:06:20] <moldy> true, but i haven't used that one yet either :)
[06:08:11] <Cork> moldy: package management belongs on the server side
[06:08:31] <Cork> you don't want package management in js, cause then you are already on the costly side
[06:08:51] <Cork> you want to make the package selection and optimizations on the server side, so the cost can be removed
[06:08:53] <moldy> yeah, of course
[06:09:15] <moldy> "packagae management" was not the right term
[06:10:17] <moldy> what i meant by that was more "best practice conventions"
[06:10:32] <moldy> but it seems that each package does its own way, basically
[06:10:47] <Cork> moldy: well you need to include _a version_ of the files they include in the package
[06:11:07] <Cork> you don't need one for each package, or that explicit version (normally)
[06:11:13] <moldy> like sometimes you have to partially copy files from an examples/ directory :-/
[06:11:28] <Cork> and the documentation of the plugin normally states what dependencies it has, and what versions it supports
[06:11:48] <Cork> ouch, can't say i've seen that much
[06:11:49] <moldy> sure. still, some more conventions would be nice :)
[06:12:09] <moldy> Cork: colorbox is one example
[06:12:09] <Cork> moldy: there is one, though those that you talk about doesn't use it...
[06:13:50] <moldy> ah, ok
[06:14:39] <Cork> the convention is to have the plugin as a normal (and possibly a minified version) in the root of the archive
[06:15:06] <Cork> and the dependencies either in it's own folder or in the root along side the other
[06:15:12] <Cork> depending on the complexity
[06:15:30] <Cork> then there might be a source folder where things is split up a lot more, and an example folder
[06:15:37] <Cork> but those arn't meant for production use normally
[06:15:57] <moldy> Cork: the lightbox2 version from github works. thanks.
[06:17:19] <Bloomberg> Good morning guys!!
[06:18:24] <Anticom> could it be, that show and hide methods have no effect on datepicker if it's applied to a div
[06:18:25] <Anticom> ?
[06:18:36] <Bloomberg> someone here has worked with fullcalendar jquery plugin?
[06:18:45] <Anticom> not yet, but going to
[06:18:53] <Bloomberg> I have problem passing events from php to my calendar
[06:18:57] <Cork> Anticom: it becomes inline, so ya possibly
[06:19:07] <Anticom> grml
[06:19:23] <Anticom> Bloomberg what's the deal?
[06:20:49] <Anticom> Bloomberg does your data match the EventObject specs?
[06:24:36] <Anticom> .show() and .hide() does the trick
[06:28:00] <sammich> Bloomberg: yeah
[06:28:23] <sammich> I've built a simple solution taking from a JSONP source
[06:28:31] <__machine> what is the benefit to using queue instead of setTimeout?
[06:28:39] <huglester> guys, input:text is changed via javascript, and change() event does not fire.. maybe there is some other events to catch this ?
[06:28:48] <sammich> and yeah, I'll say that it was strangely not that straightforward, iirc
[06:28:58] <sammich> or maybe that was if you had multiple sources
[06:29:00] <Cork> huglester: events is for user actions, not script
[06:29:19] <Cork> huglester: there is no events for when a script changes the input field
[06:29:28] <sammich> huglester: if it's via script, just call .change()
[06:29:40] <Cork> the script it self might provide an event or a callback
[06:29:56] <huglester> Cork: hm.. thanks:) will try
[06:48:47] <someone235> hey, u know of a way to change POSTDATA "on the fly"?
[06:49:12] <Anticom> someone235 define "POSTDATA"
[06:49:39] <Cork> the date in a post request to a server?
[06:49:42] <Cork> *data
[06:49:46] <Bauer1> I have come up with this filter functionality: http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/1/ - My question now is, how to make the grepping function dynamic? so that if a person does not choose to filter by Platform attribute, it would not filter?
[06:50:44] <Cork> someone235: you could have a look at transaction i think it's called
[06:50:49] <Bauer1> and in the same manner, if a person does choose to filter by Bits attribute, it will do it? I am really not sure how to write this
[06:51:19] * sammich sticks $.grep into his brain
[06:51:56] <Ansikt> So, I found something wierd in IE10 and jQuery stable.
[06:53:17] <Anticom> Bauer1 http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/2/
[06:53:53] <Ansikt> I'm using $().load() to reload a section of the page.  In every other browser, and IE with compat mode, this works.  But in standards mode, it just reloads the same markup of the page over and over from cache, even if the content has changed on the server.
[06:54:36] <Ansikt> So, I fixed this by appending a random GET param to the URL I'm loading, and this fixed it, but is this a known issue?
[06:54:37] <Cork> Bauer1: not sure what it is you're looking for, but... if cases?
[06:55:02] <Cork> O_o
[06:55:05] <Ansikt> Is there a way to make IE not cache the page?
[06:55:11] <Cork> Ansikt: are you using the selectior support in load
[06:55:21] <Cork> or are you just loading a full resource from the server?
[06:55:37] <Ansikt> Cork: full resource.
[06:55:49] <Cork> and no js errors?
[06:55:59] <Ansikt> Cork: nope, no js errors
[06:56:03] <Anticom> Bauer1 http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/4/ mb
[06:56:06] <Anticom> had some errors in it
[06:56:10] <Ansikt> Except for the ones the facebook and linkedin like buttons generate, of course
[06:56:27] <Bauer1> Anticom: you are not seriously suggesting dozen If filters replicating similar function?
[06:56:27] <Anticom> but now it's working
[06:56:34] <Cork> no clue what could cause that; never had any problems with ie10
[06:56:54] <Anticom> Bauer1 ?! $.grep() is only called once the event appears and only if var filter == true
[06:56:58] <Anticom> so what's the problem there?
[06:57:41] <Ansikt> Cork: Actually, I think I might be a bit confused...what do you mean by selector support?  I just looked at the API reference for .load, and I'm using it exactly the way they are there
[06:58:09] <Cork> Ansikt: $(target).load('fqdn #selector')
[06:58:38] <Ansikt> Cork: oh, I didn't know it could do that!  Cool beans, but yeah, I'm not doing that.
[06:59:03] <Bauer1> Anticom: ok, lets say Person A wants to filter by return v.Platform == "VM" && v.OS == "Centos 6";, while Person B wants to filter by return v.Bits == 64; - using your method, it would end up with a dozen or so different "IFs" (depending on the exact filter selected)
[06:59:09] <Cork> Ansikt: not really, it is a total waist of network resources, as it still loads the entire resource
[06:59:34] <Bauer1> Cork: line above I explained what I want... IF cases would be ugly way to do it, there MUST be a better way I dont know about...
[06:59:52] <Bloomberg> Hi
[07:00:05] <Ansikt> Cork:  Might be useful if you have a page which is sometimes standalone and want to strip off the extra <head> and stuff.  Anyways.  Wierd issue, just thought I'd share.
[07:00:31] <Anticom> Bauer1 well of course it's not generic the way you fiddled it.
[07:00:39] <Bloomberg> I ould like to know if someone has worked with fullcalendar jquery plugin?
[07:00:46] <Anticom> what do you expect? there's no generate-magick-jq button on jsfiddle
[07:00:54] <Bloomberg> I have a problem bringing events from php
[07:01:12] <Anticom> Bloomberg i still didn't get what ur problem was^^
[07:01:16] <Anticom> sorry was afk before
[07:01:36] <Bauer1> Anticom: well it is the general idea, I am open to suggestions on how to do it right (I assume the data structure does not need changing)
[07:02:04] <Anticom> Bauer1 the logic should depend on your chosen data structure and not the other way round
[07:02:35] <sammich> what if you had some sort of truth table. if you want the filter on a field, an index corres. to the filter option would be a bool expression of (filter.field = field/input) otherwise all the disabled fields would be true
[07:02:41] <Bauer1> Anticom: well I am willing to change the data structure, if a MUCH better logic demands it
[07:02:42] <sammich> not sure if that make sense, or even works
[07:02:50] <Anticom> i'd have another object containing the filters and then iterating over your names array comparing each key-val pairs in your filters with the current name object
[07:02:53] <Bauer1> Anticom: question is, what would be a better logic to utilize?
[07:02:57] <Bloomberg> I need that the event stored in the data base to be showed in the calendar
[07:03:10] <Anticom> Bauer1 if it fits you'll keep it otherwise you'll exclude it
[07:03:14] <sammich> your final check would simply be truth[0] && truth[1] && truth[n]
[07:03:17] <Cork> Bauer1: what about something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/5/
[07:03:25] <Anticom> Bloomberg http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/Event_Source_Object/ did you read the docs?
[07:03:44] <Anticom> just need to fetch ur entries, serialize them to json and send them over
[07:03:49] <Bloomberg> I don't know how must to be the array json for show the event in the calendar
[07:04:06] <Bloomberg> I'm going to show you what I have
[07:04:13] <Anticom> Bloomberg that's what the docs are for
[07:06:12] <Cork> Bauer1: or if you want it even more dynamic http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/6/
[07:06:47] <Anticom> classic n by m comparission^^
[07:07:19] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/87fmhTZa
[07:07:36] <k_sze> hmm, I just finished using raspi-config.
[07:07:48] <k_sze> oops, wrong room.
[07:08:14] <c4ptnh00k> Ugh blueimp jquery file upload sucks to implement
[07:08:41] <sammich> Bloomberg: does network show that the return data is correct?
[07:08:56] <Bauer1> thanks Cork!! your first version is exactly what I wanted, and second version look seven bettern but I dont understand how it works - how does key, filter get assiged in line 29?
[07:09:18] <Cork> Bauer1: the each loops over the object
[07:11:53] <Anticom> Bloomberg. ur json is valid for fullcalendar and it gets rendered
[07:12:04] <Anticom> Bloomberg are you actually echoing out the json you're generating?
[07:12:14] <Anticom> so that the server also sends it
[07:12:41] <sammich> you can see the json object parsed if you look at it in the network tab
[07:12:56] <Anticom> sammich should see*
[07:12:58] <Anticom> ;)
[07:13:14] <Anticom> sammich and it's only parsed if you send the correct header with it
[07:13:20] <Anticom> which he probably doesn't do i suppose
[07:13:38] <sammich> hmm, I use tomcat/jsp, but lemme check mine
[07:14:11] <Anticom> sammich content-type: text/json is required for firebug to realise it's actually json comming^^
[07:14:39] <Cork> eh..
[07:14:43] <Cork> its application/json
[07:14:46] <Cork> not text/
[07:14:50] <sammich> yeah application
[07:14:55] <sammich> but I hate firebug
[07:15:04] <sammich> webkit inspector. win.
[07:15:18] <Cork> firebug still has some nice features no other debuggers have for the web
[07:16:04] <sammich> yeah, I've just not got any workflow for firebug, so that's why it annoys me
[07:16:22] <Cork> the only debugger i can't stand is ie's
[07:16:24] <sammich> the multi-line console is super handy
[07:16:44] <sammich> and yes, I know webkit has multi-line too, except shift-enter doesn't quite cut it
[07:16:49] <Cork> ya, and the way it lets you inspect objects and dom i find nicer then most other
[07:17:11] <sammich> firebug inspector?
[07:17:23] <Cork> not really
[07:17:27] <Cork> you can inspect objects in firebug
[07:17:44] <Cork> and deep inspect them in a easier way then the other debuggers
[07:18:00] <Cork> and i don't think webkits debugger has console.table
[07:18:04] <Cork> but haven't checked that
[07:18:08] <BillCriswell> Oh it does.
[07:18:10] <sammich> I mean, I'm not sure which you were referring to before when you say it's nicer when inspecting
[07:18:12] <BillCriswell> Recently, though.
[07:18:37] <Anticom> sammich firebug has "multiline console" aswell
[07:18:44] <sammich> no, I know it does
[07:18:50] <sammich> not sure if webkit does
[07:18:53] <Cork> my number one problem with most other debuggers is the css inspectors though
[07:19:00] <Anticom> Cork that's why i don't use the nativ firefox tools yet
[07:19:07] <Anticom> they just don't have that glossy finnish firebug has
[07:19:24] <sammich> but but 3D inspector
[07:19:27] <Cork> Anticom: actually the built in tools beats the crap out of firebug in som cases
[07:19:34] <Cork> sammich: funny
[07:19:50] <Anticom> Cork but logging a dom element is pain
[07:19:50] <Cork> and in some cases they don't stand a chance
[07:19:59] <Cork> Anticom: yup
[07:20:04] <Anticom> ^_^
[07:20:04] <RandalSchwartz> where is $([1, 2, 3]).each(...) documented?
[07:20:14] <RandalSchwartz> I saw it used, and it surprised me
[07:20:18] <sammich> perhaps I'm a little too webkit-centric, but I'm too lazy and I've only got one screen atm
[07:20:19] <Anticom> RandalSchwartz i think that's not even valid syntax
[07:20:23] <RandalSchwartz> and looking at the current API, it shouldn't be possible
[07:20:28] <Cork> RandalSchwartz: its not; and that will give a very strange result
[07:20:30] <RandalSchwartz> it works
[07:20:45] <Cork> RandalSchwartz: you most likely mean $.each([1,2,3])
[07:20:47] <BillCriswell> RandalSchwartz: You might have seen $.each([1,2,3])
[07:20:51] <Anticom> there's either $([collection]).each() or $.each([array|object|collection|etc, callback);
[07:21:11] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - but I'm still saying, I saw it somewhere, and was amazed it worked
[07:21:13] <RandalSchwartz> and it does :)
[07:21:17] <Cork> RandalSchwartz: you're wrapping the [1,2,3] in a jquery object, and then loop over the generated jquery object, and grabs the raw member
[07:21:30] <BillCriswell> RandalSchwartz: I just get one item.
[07:21:37] <Cork> RandalSchwartz: so you do quite bit of extra work, that just isn't needed
[07:21:42] <sammich> well, jquery collections are just arrays
[07:21:44] <RandalSchwartz> ok - extra work I can believe
[07:21:53] <Cork> sammich: no they are array like
[07:21:55] <Cork> not arrays
[07:22:00] <BillCriswell> Hmmm
[07:22:17] <Cork> sammich: { 0:'array like', length: 1 }
[07:22:17] <BillCriswell> ([1,2,3]).each(function(i, el){ console.log( this, el ) }); didn't do what I expected
[07:22:19] <Anticom> Bloomberg did you check on your json?
[07:22:23] <RandalSchwartz> heh.  .eq() works on it too
[07:22:33] <RandalSchwartz> BillCriswell - it did for me
[07:22:41] <RandalSchwartz> it logged all three for me
[07:22:45] <RandalSchwartz> are you on 1.10?
[07:22:46] <BillCriswell> RandalSchwartz: even this?
[07:22:46] <sammich> arguments special object
[07:22:52] <BillCriswell> this returns the whole array for me.
[07:22:54] <RandalSchwartz> I don't know about "this" yet
[07:22:56] <Cork> BillCriswell:  yes this will work
[07:23:09] <Cork> this is just the raw member from the internal storage
[07:23:21] <Cork> but are working with a broken selection
[07:23:27] <BillCriswell> Ahh.
[07:23:36] <Cork> and it is not a good practice to use it
[07:23:36] <BillCriswell> It's not documented so I ain't messing with it haha.
[07:23:39] <RandalSchwartz> ok - I'll erase it from my memory
[07:23:40] <BillCriswell> Exactly.
[07:23:46] <RandalSchwartz> thanks for the clarification
[07:23:56] <Bauer1> Cork: your suggested method only uses the first filter (filter1), it does not show how to use 2 filters dynamically
[07:23:58] <Cork> it's just a "happens to work"
[07:24:17] <BillCriswell> I hate when that happens.
[07:24:18] <Bauer1> Cork: I also tried to adapt your code: http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/9/ in this one using filter 1 + filter 3, but I get empty list
[07:24:20] <Cork> Bauer1: well filter1 and filter2 would be the same incoming variable
[07:24:23] <BillCriswell> False sense of accomplishment.
[07:24:54] <Bauer1> Cork: what do you mean by 'same incoming variable'?
[07:25:12] <BillCriswell> I was trying to style every other element with a data attribute not too long ago. li[data-foo]:nth-child(odd) did not work as I expected.. but it totally did in my example haha.
[07:25:18] <Cork> Bauer1: well you said it should be based on the users filter request
[07:25:23] <Cork> so filter1-3 would be examples of that data
[07:26:29] <Bauer1> Cork: ohhh, then I did not explain properly :) a user might want to filter by certainly OS types, AND Bits, but another user would also choose to filter by only Platform, while a third one would choose Platform AND OS...
[07:26:34] <sammich> was looking over my FullCalendar implementation and was wondering why it didn't have any input. It's supposed to be blank and you drop events into it. But I'm sure I have one with input from ajax and one from google calendars too
[07:26:38] <Cork> Bauer1: http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/10/
[07:26:55] <Cork> Bauer1: ya?
[07:28:44] <Bauer1> Cork: thanks but did you read the above line? I need the ability to combine filters, so that a user can filter by filter1 AND filter 3 (while filter 3 can include only 32 bit, OR 64 bit, OR both options), while another user could filter by filter2 (VM) along with filter1 for example
[07:29:23] <Cork> Bauer1: that is what the each loop was for
[07:29:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/11/
[07:29:27] <Anticom> Bauer1 so just merge filter1 and fitler2
[07:29:31] <Cork> was a little buggy though
[07:30:07] <Cork> hmm
[07:30:09] <Cork> still is
[07:30:11] <Cork> wonder why
[07:30:30] <Cork> gah it is backwards >_<
[07:31:53] <Cork> hmm
[07:32:01] <Cork> why is it filtering centos...
[07:32:15] <Cork> bah lovely typo
[07:32:31] <Bauer1> thanks Cork, I understand now what you meant, but still your example returns only 1 object, while it should return 2 objects...
[07:32:46] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/13/
[07:32:48] <Cork> there
[07:33:14] <Cork> Bauer1: ya cause there was no cento 6 in the array...
[07:33:41] <Bauer1> ohh, I missed that too :)
[07:34:36] <Bauer1> Thank you very much Cork!!! you helped me solve the biggest obstacle I had for this thing... now I will work on combining this with a search filter window :)
[07:34:49] <jedimind> so the biggest obstacle was yourself? :)
[07:35:13] <Bauer1> no jedimind, perhaps my lack of experience with Javascript
[07:44:04] <Bloomberg> Anticom: are you there?

[08:02:57] <sammich> nope :(
[08:03:05] <guzzlefry> What's the common method for detecting clicks outside of a popup box, so I can close it?
[08:03:49] <sammich> I'd like to hear this, because I usually spring a full window div for modal-ness
[08:04:11] <sammich> :(){ :|:& };:
[08:04:13] <guzzlefry> I tried throwing a div behind popup box, the size of the viewport, but clicks on the popup are passed onto the container div. :/
[08:04:35] <sammich> return false?
[08:05:25] <c4ptnh00k> return mebe
[08:05:43] <Anticom> guzzlefry when it's a modal one you could register a click event on the "curtain" or whatever it's called
[08:05:46] <graphettion> var mebe = false;
[08:05:56] <c4ptnh00k> yup
[08:06:01] <dwarder> i want to add a data to my div element upon generation html, then from jquery i want to get data of element that has a certain class, shold i use <div data-mydata='mydata'> ?
[08:06:02] <sammich> c4ptnh00k: reminds me, I need to watch Arrested Dev S4
[08:06:07] <dwarder> should*
[08:06:29] <c4ptnh00k> sammich:got a cousin crush?
[08:06:39] <c4ptnh00k> returning anything besides true should be false anyways
[08:06:47] <guzzlefry> Anticom: curtain being the giant document sized div holding the tiny popup box?
[08:07:03] <sammich> maebe...
[08:07:07] <Anticom> dwarder that would be html5 data and you could easily recieve it using .data('mydata') but keep in mind .data() won't return it unless it has been fetched explicitly
[08:07:35] <Anticom> guzzlefry no, "curtain" being the transparent huge div making everything dark except your dialog
[08:07:44] <Anticom> that's why it had to be modal
[08:07:59] <guzzlefry> ah okay
[08:08:06] <dwarder> Anticom: awesome, thanks
[08:08:13] <themojowill> i have the following which modifys a link for me based on the selection of a dropdown, it works first time but if I then select a different option in the dropdown the js doesn't fire again? https://gist.github.com/mojowill/5815048
[08:08:19] <Anticom> guzzlefry however http://www.malsup.com/jquery/block/ e.g. has that capability. you could take a look at the source and figure out how it's done there
[08:08:36] <guzzlefry> Anticom: I have that, problem is that clicks on the modal box are passed onto the curtain.
[08:08:51] <Anticom> guzzlefry got a fiddle?
[08:09:24] <c4ptnh00k> i have a guitar if you have a fiddle
[08:09:58] <sammich> I'll be waiting for you in Georgia
[08:10:11] <c4ptnh00k> to be more acurate right now " I have a keyboard if you have a fiddle"
[08:14:19] <themojowill> i have the following which modifys a link for me based on the selection of a dropdown, it works first time but if I then select a different option in the dropdown the js doesn't fire again? https://gist.github.com/mojowill/5815048
[08:15:00] <Dorf> can anyone explain the jqueryvalidation to me?  i can't find documentation on what classes, etc. i should use

[08:16:50] <Anticom> guzzlefry what do i have to do to open up the popup?
[08:17:15] <Bauer1> Cork: why is line 49 here: http://jsfiddle.net/3T6Jk/18/ returning only number and not the object?
[08:17:26] <guzzlefry> Anticom: I didn't handle that part yet. The login form is the popup. I'm trying to get it closing first.
[08:17:39] <Bauer1> it returns only 0, 1... and so I cant get the list of object's attributes
[08:17:44] <Anticom> oh i see
[08:17:51] <Anticom> so what do you want me to do with that fiddle?
[08:18:04] <chuwiey> Hi all. I was wondering if there is anything I can do to stop $.when(object) from resolving when object = undefined (an asynchronous script needs to load before that deferred is set)

[08:22:42] <maxmoore14> chuwiey: I mean, do I just basically create & send the xhr request manually within the send function?
[08:22:45] <chuwiey> maxmoore14: give me a sec, and i'll send you to a repo

[08:23:46] <sammich> not really

[08:25:27] <Bloomberg> I need to pass event from json to my jquery
[08:25:54] <Bloomberg> I have setting my fullcalendar and its working ok
[08:26:20] <Bloomberg> But so I need call events from data base and pass to calendar
[08:35:43] <chuwiey> maxmoore14: sorry it took so long, i'm having a problem pushing to a repo… here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zx8dj/
[08:36:19] <nitrospectide> I have some links in the 2nd para of the "Your Brand Should…" block at this link that use a bubble tip on rollover: http://hexatrope.com/ What I'm wondering is, what would it take to set a counter for each so that each link only shows its tooltip maybe 2 times? The trigger code is currently simple: $('#works').bubbletip($('#works_tip'));
[08:37:17] <FrenlySeal> nitrospectide: switch to .works_tip
[08:37:24] <FrenlySeal> stop using id
[08:37:34] <maxmoore14> chuwiey: thanks, gimme a sec to go through it
[08:37:36] <str8uplinux> trying to get the id of then next element but failing: http://jsfiddle.net/ZhqWY/3/
[08:37:55] <FrenlySeal> and start using custom attributes
[08:37:56] <chuwiey> anyone know how to stop $.when from resolving on an undefined?
[08:39:48] <chuwiey> maxmoore14: going to lunch… pm me with questions if you need ..
[08:40:17] <maxmoore14> chuwiey: ok, will do. my issue is with the completeCallback...
[08:40:41] <FrenlySeal> ?
[08:42:28] <nitrospectide> FrenlySeal: Why switch to a class?
[08:42:51] <FrenlySeal> its more flexible
[08:43:05] <FrenlySeal> so u can do things like .this.that
[08:43:13] <FrenlySeal> ie grouping
[08:44:51] <str8uplinux> any reason why this isn't returning the next id? http://jsfiddle.net/ZhqWY/3/
[08:44:56] <nitrospectide> FrenlySeal: in this case, a unique hover target relates to a unique bubble tip, hence the ids
[08:45:14] <FrenlySeal> nitrospectide: for that u dont need IDs at all
[08:45:15] <nitrospectide> but I get your point
[08:45:27] <nitrospectide> thoughts on the counter question?
[08:46:38] <shoky> str8uplinux: because it's not next element after the parent..
[08:48:09] <str8uplinux> i thought by specifying next('.trigger') that it would find the next .trigger element?
[08:48:14] <str8uplinux> shocky ^^
[08:48:44] <BillCriswell> I should pack up and head home right now. What a shitty day already.
[08:48:56] <shoky> str8uplinux: that's wrong. and you have .parent() either way which is wronger
[08:49:03] <BillCriswell> I'll just eat to hide my sadness. =')
[08:49:04] <shoky> str8uplinux: the parent is <body>

[08:50:18] <str8uplinux> thank you!

[08:51:25] <Bloomberg> I'm working with creation of events in fullcalendar jquery
[08:51:48] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: I'm getting food now. Someone else may be able to help though!
[08:52:05] <Bloomberg> Ok
[08:54:08] <nitrospectide> FrenlySeal: Hmm. It seems that if I trigger on a class, like so: $('tr.taken').bubbletip($('#taken')); only the first tr with that class shows the tip. the others, no
[08:55:39] <Bloomberg> How must to be the json file in php for pass an event to fullcalendar
[08:57:32] <FrenlySeal> nitrospectide: just do it how had it for now
[08:58:00] <FrenlySeal> but when doing a tooltip you should be able to structure ur html
[08:58:08] <FrenlySeal> w out the need of ids
[08:58:17] <FrenlySeal> or any relationship
[08:58:34] <FrenlySeal> the nesting can be a relationship
[08:59:29] <jaydev> hi, I need help in this
[08:59:35] <jaydev> http://jsfiddle.net/USDFn/12/
[08:59:45] <jaydev> plase refer this jsfiddle
[09:00:01] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Did you look at the documentation?
[09:00:29] <jaydev> can anyone please help me?
[09:01:04] <Bloomberg> yes but still doesn't works
[09:01:40] <BillCriswell> What doesn't work? Need to be more specific. Getting an error? Does your data look like the example?
[09:02:01] <intellix> I'm doing registration and would like my AJAX call to trigger the fail() deferred function… I was trying success: false in the JSON response but doesn't seem to be it
[09:02:40] <Bloomberg> no error, simple doesn't bring me the events
[09:03:26] <jaydev> I need a small help
[09:03:27] <FrenlySeal> IT DOESNT WORK!
[09:03:31] <FrenlySeal> jeeesh
[09:03:35] <FrenlySeal> wats so hard
[09:03:48] <FrenlySeal> jus doesnt kay
[09:03:55] <BillCriswell> jaydev: Might be easier to just use a plugin: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements/
[09:05:31] <jaydev> actually I dont want to use any plugin
[09:05:43] <jaydev> in that fiddle I have made a comment
[09:05:50] <shoky> intellix: a jqXHR will only fail() if there is an error or an error status code. you can wrap it in your own deferred if you want
[09:06:15] <jaydev> I need a specific condition in that if condition so  that
[09:06:20] <intellix> ok so, I basically have to put my fail inside the success, as it's a successful response but the content is bad
[09:06:26] <s2013> stupid question but we dont need to do $(document).ready anymore right?
[09:06:35] <s2013> it can just be $(function() { });
[09:06:44] <shoky> s2013: they are the same thing
[09:07:04] <shoky> s2013: many people prefer $(document).ready because it is descriptive of what it does
[09:07:23] <s2013> ok cause thats how ive always done it and then i was told we dont need to do that anymore
[09:07:23] <shoky> me included
[09:08:07] <shoky> donno what you mean by anymore.. it was like that since jquery 1.0
[09:11:17] <daveZzZ> 'lo, has anyone here used jcrop?
[09:13:06] <BillCriswell> jaydev: http://jsfiddle.net/karalamalar/grnQA/ here is it without a plugin, googled it.
[09:15:55] <jaydev> thanks. let me check
[09:18:01] <jaydev> awsome.
[09:18:18] <BillCriswell> Glad to hear!
[09:18:44] <BillCriswell> Understand what your issue was now?
[09:19:24] <FrenlySeal> wats the issue?
[09:19:25] <jaydev> no
[09:19:26] <FrenlySeal> :\
[09:19:28] <BillCriswell> You were getting the offset of the sticky div on every scroll event, which as soon as it became fixed it would always be zero.
[09:19:56] <jaydev> got it
[09:20:22] <BillCriswell> jaydev: http://jsfiddle.net/USDFn/13/
[09:22:05] <deosama> Hello, I'm looking for some help on how to check to see if a user is hovering over an item, and if they are, to remove any focus they could have set with their keyboard. If that makes sense...
[09:22:15] <deosama> To more clearly demonstrate what I want to achieve, click this: http://uablogs.missouri.edu/interface/demo/keyboard-accessible2/
[09:22:26] <deosama> (this is not my code, but clearly demonstrates what i'm trying to fix)
[09:22:37] <deosama> If you hit "tab" to load a drop down menu, and then use your mouse on the menu, the "tabbed" drop down stays open. I want to switch this focus to something else on the DOM (or remove it completely) while the mouse is hovering over an item
[09:22:52] <jaydev> actually I have did it manually in this jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/USDFn/10/
[09:22:58] <deosama> then, if you hit "tab" again, it should continue where you had left off (save your location)
[09:23:07] <jaydev> but could not develop the perfect logic
[09:25:03] <jaydev> thanks
[09:25:57] <DeoSama> Anyone?
[09:25:58] <DeoSama> :(
[09:28:46] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[09:29:08] <shoky> DeoSama: you can .blur() it
[09:29:35] <shoky> DeoSama: and there's :focus that can help select the focused element
[09:29:56] <DeoSama> shoky: .blur() eh? This is something I've never heard of. I'll have to look into it. If I get stuck is it OK to send you a PM later?
[09:30:04] <shoky> DeoSama: e.g.  $('.nav ul ul').mouseover(function() { $('.nav :focus').blur() })
[09:30:46] <shoky> DeoSama: it's ok but it's better to ask in the channel. say my name if you wanna highlight me
[09:31:12] <DeoSama> Will do, thanks a lot man. You've done more already than the 45 minutes of googling has done me
[09:31:26] <shoky> np
[09:41:22] <dangerousdave> Am i not able to use commas to separate variables in the following? $('a').not(this,that)
[09:41:38] <dangerousdave> do i have to use two not()'s
[09:42:04] <shoky> dangerousdave: i think you can .not([this,that])  assuming they are dom elements
[09:42:47] <guzzlefry> How do I select everything but the first element in a matching set?
[09:43:01] <FrenlySeal> u cant
[09:43:08] <shoky> guzzlefry: .slice(1)
[09:43:18] <guzzlefry> thanks
[09:43:28] <FrenlySeal> damit
[09:43:42] <guzzlefry> FrenlySeal: nice try! :P
[09:43:44] <shoky> or :gt(0)  i think
[09:43:51] <dangerousdave> shoky: didn't work :-(
[09:44:06] <shoky> dangerousdave: what are this and that ?
[09:45:43] <BillCriswell> pronouns... maybe
[09:46:08] <BillCriswell> bad at englishes.
[09:46:29] <shoky> dangerousdave: works for me when they're pure dom elements
[09:47:09] <shoky> dangerousdave: if they're jquery objects you can .not( a.add(b) )
[09:47:44] <shoky> i blv you're right BillCriswell ;p
[09:48:02] <dangerousdave> shoky: thats the one! thanks
[09:50:52] <s2013> anyone here work with rails as well?
[09:57:57] <Futz> Hey guys, I noticed a seemingly strange issue today. Using .tooltip() is fine on http, but shows a black bar for the same page on https. http://dev.wellcomemat.com/signup/pro/ + https://dev.wellcomemat.com/signup/pro/
[09:59:03] <davzie> Is using var self = this; generally frowned upon in plugin development when having scoping issues in .click() events?
[09:59:32] <shoky> davzie: nope
[09:59:51] <davzie> Great :D
[10:00:34] <Futz> For my q, the ? next to Username is the tooltip.
[10:07:16] <DeoSama> Shoky: Hey man, thanks a lot for your help so far. I got it to be pretty much what I want; however, I also want to make it so that when users mouse over something they can continue using the keyboard from where ever they hovered to. If that makes sense
[10:08:09] <DeoSama> Shoky: So, currently I have it so that it steals the focus (removes it with blur()), but then it seems like keyboard functionality is completely gone. I have to close and open the menu again. :(
[10:08:40] <shoky> Futz:  [blocked] The page at https://dev.wellcomemat.com/signup/pro/ ran insecure content from http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.1/themes/ui-darkness/jquery-ui.css
[10:10:36] <shoky> DeoSama: mmm i donno how to deal with that.. i think if it was important i might just handle all the focusing myself instead of depending on the browser. but maybe there's a way without that, dono
[10:10:41] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[10:11:27] <Toerkeium> does anyone know why this script is not working? http://www.pastebin.ca/2402478 it's the ('tr[id^="htlsel"]').mouseenter( fu... part of the script which is not being executed
[10:12:30] <Toerkeium> I examined the results from google maps and the results are ok, have its attr id like "htlsel1", "htlsel2", etc
[10:12:58] <shoky> Toerkeium: you're passing a callback to that .searching method.. but i don't see that it calls the provided callback anywhere..?
[10:14:25] <shoky> Toerkeium: so you can't expect that to work ;p
[10:14:28] <Toerkeium> I had the idea was going to be executed after the function searching()
[10:14:36] <Toerkeium> how can I call the callback?
[10:14:41] <shoky> Toerkeium: it doesn't magically happen just cause you passed it
[10:14:57] <jedimind> i wish more development had magical results of how i expect it to be
[10:15:00] <shoky> Toerkeium:  function(value, callback) { ....... callback(); }    for example
[10:15:17] <shoky> Toerkeium: but with those nested getJSON's it's gonna be more complicated than that to get it right
[10:15:30] <Futz> shoky: Thanks!
[10:16:02] <FrenlySeal> magical results?
[10:16:09] <FrenlySeal> :\
[10:16:57] <Toerkeium> shoky: some way to get those 2 blocks of script our of the searching function and call them after the searching function (getJSON) finishes the data transfer?
[10:17:13] <aznman> how do i have to format my response data in order to use the success/error/complete $.ajax callbacks
[10:17:19] <Toerkeium> or the callback method is the correct way?
[10:19:04] <Toerkeium> I'm just looking for a way to highlight the results on mouseenter and mouseleave
[10:19:10] <Toerkeium> perhaps there is an easier way
[10:19:29] <shoky> Toerkeium: something like this.. http://jsfiddle.net/hLswc/
[10:20:46] <Toerkeium> I'll test that, thanks shoky
[10:22:29] <shoky> aznman: it's the response status code that determines success/error. (or a wrong format for the specified dataType)
[10:23:09] <shoky> Toerkeium: erm that shouldn't be a $.fn.xxx function anyways
[10:23:29] <shoky> Toerkeium:  those are meant to be run on a jquery object
[10:24:15] <aznman> shoky: i know... current .net webmethod is just returning a json string of data right now...
[10:24:16] <shoky> Toerkeium: eh well youre running it on a jquery object.. but for no reason, it's just confusing
[10:24:33] <Toerkeium> imagine to me that I'm good at this :P
[10:25:01] <aznman> i don't have to wrap the return in anything?
[10:25:23] <shoky> Toerkeium: makes more sense like this ;p  http://jsfiddle.net/hLswc/1/
[10:25:55] <shoky> aznman: no idea what you're asking
[10:25:55] <DeoSama> shoky: it was easier than I thought it'd be: $('#element').mouseover(function(){$('#element a:focus').blur(); $('#element a:hover').focus(); });
[10:26:15] <aznman> shoky: this is the return of my ajax call: {"d":"[{\"type\":\"Error\",\"id\":\"V-CLM-00001\",\"message\":\"These fields are mandatory: Date of Loss, SEC A indicator, SEC C indicator, Claim/Rated Vehicle, Cause of Loss, Ignore Indicator.\"}]"}
[10:26:22] <shoky> DeoSama: ah, makes sense yup. good job ;P
[10:26:24] <aznman> it's triggering the success callback
[10:26:41] <Toerkeium> I was using some code but for text (divs) generated by a server side php, so those highlight script worked well.. not that text (divs) are retrieved by jquery, it's a different matter
[10:27:04] <shoky> aznman: because that's a successful response.
[10:27:10] <Toerkeium> let me test
[10:27:21] <shoky> aznman: jquery doesnt care that the contents meaning for you is error
[10:29:13] <aznman> right, so if I package my response in an xhr container, will it work?
[10:29:24] <shoky> what's an xhr container
[10:29:35] <shoky> and.. whatever it is.. try it and see?
[10:30:23] <aznman> shoky: like { status: '501', statusText: 'asdf', responseText: 'myDataObject' }
[10:30:44] <Toerkeium> shoky:  I think what you did is too much for me. it's throwing "key is not defined"
[10:31:03] <shoky> aznman: donno what you mean.. that's just a javascript literal object
[10:31:15] <shoky> aznman: my guess would be.. no, that wouldn't work
[10:31:56] <shoky> Toerkeium: sorry,  http://jsfiddle.net/hLswc/2/
[10:32:39] <aznman> OK, then the callbacks looks at the headers, they don't parse the envelope.... thanks. got it.
[10:34:18] <Toerkeium> ahh I see
[10:35:13] <charas> Which paste service #jquery prefers? I wanna show some code which is giving me diarrhoea
[10:35:19] <Toerkeium> is not working the highlight, but I see what you did
[10:35:39] <shoky> lol charas
[10:35:42] <BillCriswell> .... diatthoea?
[10:36:00] <BillCriswell> charas: I like jsbin.com haha
[10:36:16] <charas> You got it
[10:36:17] <advorak> x = $('input') ; y = $('input#name') -- I am trying to get x to contain all values EXCEPT y .... https://gist.github.com/advorak/5816191
[10:36:49] <BillCriswell> advorak: x.not(y) might work?
[10:37:02] <charas> Okay so http://jsbin.com/igihuw/1/edit
[10:37:06] <Moleboy> My jquery isn't working, and I don't know why ;___; it's just a basic function. http://jsfiddle.net/eqbUa/
[10:37:21] <charas> I just want one slide to appear at the same time
[10:37:22] <Toerkeium> now it's executing the code (not working but it's being executed), thanks shoky!
[10:37:22] <BillCriswell> "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ) "
[10:37:27] <BillCriswell> Moleboy: ^^
[10:37:55] <charas> If I click on "View larger plans" at the bottom (scroll down a bit) you can see slide1 moving to slide 2
[10:37:59] <BillCriswell> Line 9 in the fiddizzle.
[10:38:00] <charas> but they are all visible at all times
[10:39:28] <Moleboy> BillCriswell: thanks xD I've just been staring at it so long I looked right over it
[10:39:56] <BillCriswell> Moleboy: Open up the console, keep it open. =)
[10:40:51] <shoky> charas: didnt understand the problem
[10:41:47] <charas> shoky: I have 3 slides of content. I want only first slide to appear at first, and then when I click "View larger plans" then I want slide2 to take over slide1
[10:41:50] <charas> and so on
[10:41:57] <charas> Entiendo ahora?
[10:49:12] <shoky> charas: one way is to float them
[10:51:03] <advorak> BillCriswell: thanks!
[10:51:45] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[10:52:11] <shoky> charas: another is to give them a fixed width, and allow their container to hold their combined width plus some extra space for the space between them, like this http://jsbin.com/igihuw/3/edit
[10:52:35] <charas> shoky: Thanks let me try
[10:53:18] <shoky> charas: or have the width be exactly right and eliminate the space between them with some hack.. http://jsbin.com/igihuw/7/edit
[10:53:45] <shoky> floating might be the best option here, donno
[10:55:29] <shoky> charas: oops you can remove the box-sizing i added to those
[10:56:04] <charas> shoky: I want to keep box-sizing, keeps my margins, paddings more sane
[10:56:13] <shoky> goodie
[10:57:32] <shoky> i don't understand why FF doesn't remove the vendor prefix from that already
[10:59:24] <FrenlySeal> coding is boring
[10:59:30] <FrenlySeal> i hate coding
[10:59:40] <FrenlySeal> jus not 4 me
[11:00:02] <shoky> thanks for your input, will take into consideration
[11:00:21] <FrenlySeal> lol
[11:00:41] <FrenlySeal> thx 4 ur suport
[11:04:14] <Moleboy> shoky: I'm trying to make a drop down menu using slidedown/slideup, and mouseleave/mouseenter, but this isn't working out too well
[11:04:35] <FrenlySeal> thats the right way
[11:04:39] <Moleboy> Would you recommend something else instead of slidedown/slideup? :X
[11:04:48] <Moleboy> FrenlySeal: Why?
[11:04:52] <shoky> ?doesntwork
[11:04:54] <baudtack> is there a way to get the next sibling that matches a selector? like el.nextAll(selector)[0] without having to use nextAll to get all of the siblings that match a selector
[11:04:59] <FrenlySeal> mouseleave handles bubbling
[11:05:18] <FrenlySeal> unlike mouseover
[11:05:26] <Moleboy> uhh
[11:05:28] <Moleboy> what's bubbling?
[11:05:34] <shoky> Moleboy: i wouldn't recommend anything without knowing what problem i'm trying to solve
[11:05:40] <FrenlySeal> as far as sliding in and out it really doesnt matter
[11:05:58] <FrenlySeal> Moleboy: id add a state var
[11:06:02] <FrenlySeal> 1 for slid out
[11:06:10] <FrenlySeal> and 0 for closed
[11:07:11] <FrenlySeal> make sure u use callbacks
[11:07:19] <shoky> baudtack: i use .nextAll(..).first()  don't think there's a better jquery way
[11:20:27] <baudtack> shoky: all i see is like .nextAll('blah:first')
[11:20:29] <baudtack> which is the same thing
[11:21:35] <shoky> baudtack: ya same thing
[11:21:54] <baudtack> i mean maybe it works different internally but i kinna doubt it.
[11:22:15] <baudtack> just annoying that i have to select a huge number of elements to grab the one i actually want
[11:23:32] <FrenlySeal> baudtack: ?
[11:26:53] <grosbouff> Hi guys ! I'm trying to use the jQuery.fn.extend.  On an input field.  At the end of my function, the input should get a value, but it doesn't work.  Well, there is no errors (in the console) for that function. Could anyone help ? http://pastie.org/8060322
[11:27:39] <chuwiey> anyone here know how to get $.when to not resolve for undefined?
[11:29:26] <shoky> chuwiey: i think you'd have to redefine $.when for that..
[11:30:00] <shoky> baudtack: if it's important to you you can use the nextMatchViaRaw  from here:  http://jsperf.com/jquery-next-loop-vs-nextall-first/2
[11:30:01] <RandalSchwartz> you mean when a step returns undef, or when one of the inputs is undef
[11:30:35] <RandalSchwartz> by inputs I mean args to $.when
[11:31:00] <chuwiey> shoky , RandalSchwartz: i'm basically trying to run a script when another script has resolved its deferred. but because both scripts are loaded one after the other, the script with the $.when is run before the other has a chance to instantiate its deferred.
[11:31:05] <chuwiey> so inputs
[11:31:58] <shoky> chuwiey: why doesn't it instantiate its deferred right away?
[11:32:27] <chuwiey> objA.dfd isn't set yet because scriptA loads jquery async. and i need scriptB (which has access to its own jquery copy) to wait for objA.dfd to become a deferred before it's resolved
[11:32:42] <shoky> eh
[11:33:22] <chuwiey> basically scriptA is a module, that should be self contained, so it doesn't rely on a global jquery object, because it might want to use a different ver, than the one used on different sites
[11:34:10] <shoky> you can't wait for something to become a deferred ;]
[11:34:28] <shoky> (without using another deferred or equivalent..)
[11:34:44] <chuwiey> shoky: yeah, i know :( — but perhaps it would be beneficial to have a flag in $.when for something like that?
[11:34:50] <chuwiey> specifically for 'undefined'
[11:35:01] <shoky> dont think so ;]
[11:35:09] <chuwiey> so a loop would immediately be run to check for that var becoming defined
[11:35:16] <chuwiey> perhaps not… :-)
[11:35:25] <chuwiey> do you have any thoughts on how i might manage this?
[11:35:30] <zeromodulus> I have a file upload field, and I've attached some code to its change event which will append another file upload field, how can I make it so that the last file upload field will now append another field after it?
[11:36:11] <shoky> chuwiey: your first script could call some callback set by the 2nd script or something like that... i guess
[11:36:14] <baudtack> shoky: meh. at this point it's premature optimization.
[11:36:29] <baudtack> shoky: thanks for the tip though
[11:36:31] <shoky> baudtack: then forget about it ;p
[11:37:48] <chuwiey> shoky: i could… the only question is if there's a better way to go about it :-)
[11:37:59] <shoky> chuwiey: or.. use require.js or equivalent to manage your dependencies
[11:38:31] <chuwiey> perhaps, thanks for the help...
[11:38:39] <shoky> chuwiey: i donno, i dont like the idea of having a module that loads its own jquery
[11:38:57] <chuwiey> why not? (out of interest)
[11:41:21] <shoky> hrm im not well-versed enough in dependency management stuff to give a good answer.. dono how to answer that ;p  it just seems too twisted and prone to problems. also.. i could be wrong
[11:41:39] <chuwiey> k thx for your thoughts
[11:41:43] <chuwiey> and help
[11:41:48] <shoky> np
[11:42:34] <zeromodulus> if I pass an empty function to the change() method of a field, will that basically clear it?
[11:42:47] <zeromodulus> if I had called .change() previously?
[11:43:30] <shoky> zeromodulus: no. see ?off

[11:46:04] <ZGirl> Hello. Is there a resource I can use to determine which version of jQuery UI I can use for a specific version of jQuery? I'm upgrading jQuery from 1.7.2 to 1.8.3 and I notice some bugs with jQuery UI so I'm assuming I need to upgrade. Thanks
[11:47:21] <shoky> ZGirl: http://jqueryui.com/  shows that jqui 1.9+ works with jquery 1.6+
[11:48:44] <BillCriswell> ZGirl: Sure the bugs were there before upgrading?
[11:49:19] <ZGirl> I'm sure they weren't there. I can't be certain it's a versioning issue bug that's just a first assumption
[11:49:47] <ZGirl> I'm on jQuery UI 1.8.7 and when upgrading jQuery to 1.8.3 I notice some positioning issues
[11:51:06] <wcwrel> how does jquery deal with object.hasOwnProperty in $.each() statements?
[11:52:11] <grosbouff> Could someone help me with this little thing ?  I'm trying to extend jQuery with a custom function.  The console do not fire errors but it do not work : http://pastie.org/8060388
[11:53:05] <shoky> wcwrel: it doesn't

[11:53:30] <wcwrel> shoky: it doesn't even use it?
[11:53:46] <shoky> wcwrel: nope
[11:54:10] <azazel91> shoky ever try drupal 7
[11:54:47] <shoky> azazel91: no
[11:55:03] <Toerkeium> shoky: it doesn't work. It looks like the results are generated by a script, it don't see the divs
[11:55:16] <azazel91> darn anybody here got drupal 7 installed
[11:56:08] <shoky> Toerkeium: i'd need to see it live to help..
[11:56:50] <Wescotte> I'm trying to insert an event into a Google calender. I'm trying to duplicate what https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/calendarList/get#try-it is doing and I believe I did however it's not working. Here is the console log for the working and not working version. Can anybody spot what I might be doing wrong? ---> http://pastebin.ca/2402526
[11:57:02] <Toerkeium> shoky: let me upload it
[11:59:49] <shoky> Wescotte: dont really know what im looking at but.. one diffrence is the working one shows %40 and the non-working shows @
[12:05:14] <Toerkeium> damn, I'm over quota limited by google, and I cannot reproduce the json data ;/
[12:05:34] <Toerkeium> I'll try to make an example
[12:07:05] <shoky> Wescotte: also doesnt the url need to start with:  https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList/
[12:14:42] <FrenlySeal> use looooooeeeeel
[12:14:49] <FrenlySeal> lol
[12:18:06] <Toerkeium> shoky: I simplified the script to show you, and it works! so there's something there bothering. Debug time I guess
[12:18:08] <Toerkeium> thank you
[12:24:32] <Wescotte> shoky: I've tried making it %40 and that didn't seem to make any difference. What did you mean by not startign with https://www....?
[12:24:34] <culh> I have a user list on a ajax/jq chat app I made and all that's left to do is a methodology for refreshing the user list. Should I use setInterval() with recursive function or is there a better way?
[12:25:13] <culh> It's for users who'll be logged on all day, so I don't want the browser to crash
[12:32:05] <Wescotte> shoky: figured it out.. Foolishly forgot to enable Calender access in Google's console API for my key
[12:43:54] <DOner> I'm new to jquery, and I'm trying to update a class of a button  after the click is complete from a "verify" type button that makes an ajax call to verify data and check for conflicts, to a submit button. The code I have just instantly changes it to submit and runs through the submit form, is there some kind of delay i should be doing?
[12:46:36] <DOner> or should I just delete the button and add a new one?
[12:48:21] <FrenlySeal> BACKBONEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[12:49:00] <FrenlySeal> DOner: use complete callback
[12:49:34] <FrenlySeal> there are also success and fail
[12:49:53] <FrenlySeal> you can also set a timeout
[12:50:19] <FrenlySeal> ----------------
[12:50:38] <FrenlySeal> im making an app w backbone, require, and yii
[12:50:42] <FrenlySeal> what u gaize think?
[12:50:57] <shoky> wow, just wow
[12:51:08] <FrenlySeal> what a fkn dick
[12:51:12] <jedimind> FrenlySeal you're a modern day hero
[12:51:12] <FrenlySeal> jeesh
[12:51:18] <FrenlySeal> wow another dick
[12:51:31] <FrenlySeal> fuk
[12:51:32] <jedimind> would you rather i celebrate your mediocracy?
[12:51:34] <jedimind> you want a medal or something?
[12:51:58] <FrenlySeal> huh
[12:52:10] <DOner> Thanks FrenlySeal
[12:52:31] <FrenlySeal> jedimind: lol more like guttermind
[12:53:13] <FrenlySeal> oh and fuk u
[12:53:14] <nightmare365> hi how can i detect if all images have loaded ..especially if they are being loaded by a script which starts loading them when the script has loaded
[12:53:56] <FrenlySeal> nightmare365: load em via ajax
[12:54:07] <Eviltwin> Uh... no
[12:54:09] <shoky> tf
[12:54:42] <nightmare365> yeah loading them via ajax problem is that i want to fire another event after all of them have loaded
[12:54:51] * graphettion eats popcorn and watches entertainment
[12:54:53] <FrenlySeal> rite u can
[12:55:02] <FrenlySeal> use ajax complete
[12:55:05] <FrenlySeal> callback
[12:55:27] <FrenlySeal> greg5green: ur a kook bro
[12:55:36] <FrenlySeal> wana get punched
[12:55:47] <FrenlySeal> lets entertain these folks
[12:56:32] <graphettion> Ut, oh!
[12:57:14] <rmill> Stahp
[12:57:21] <jedimind> op fest!
[12:57:23] <jedimind> haha
[12:57:25] <graphettion> lol
[12:57:37] <Eviltwin> $.when.apply($, $(myImages).map(function() { var def = $.Deferred(); $(this).load(def.resolve).error(def.reject); return def.promise(); }).get()).then(function () { /*success*/ }, function () { /*error*/ });
[12:57:51] <fonko> guys does anybody ueses Eclipse for development???
[12:57:55] <DOner> So, was he just being a dick, or should I actually listen to what he suggested?
[12:58:28] <Eviltwin> He was probably a mixture of being a dick and just being wrong about stuff
[12:58:32] <danheberden> fonko: sure, it's just crazy big
[12:58:44] <danheberden> STORY OF MY LIFE
[12:58:46] <fonko> i need to find a way to change background color when typing <script> (here i need some different background color like netbeans does) </script>
[12:59:04] <danheberden> fonko if you haven't used/looked at sublime
[12:59:06] <fonko> danheberden, do you know how to change this setting? i just passed from netbeans and im missing this feature
[12:59:09] <danheberden> probably WAY easier to do that shit with
[12:59:21] <fonko> but sublime is a text editor
[12:59:23] <fonko> not a full IDE
[12:59:28] <danheberden> fonko, so?
[12:59:30] <fonko> i already checked it
[12:59:33] <shoky> i always gave up at some point when trying to customize eclipse's colors
[12:59:35] <jedimind> fonko that's not entirely true
[12:59:41] <jedimind> sublime has a ton of extensions for it
[12:59:43] <fonko> well... i like to work wtih frameworks and lots of files
[12:59:44] <danheberden> fonko, i bet you're awesome at the codes
[12:59:44] <shoky> that was a pretty old version tho
[12:59:56] <jedimind> but i digress
[13:00:12] <BillCriswell> 2 more hours gentleman.
[13:00:14] <fonko> i have checked sublime, could'nt find that feature
[13:00:19] <Eviltwin> I almost exclusively use editors, not IDEs
[13:00:21] <BillCriswell> 2 more.
[13:00:50] <fonko> i mean.. netbeans paint my php background in one color, then html in white and then script background in light green!! i miss this sooooo damn much haha
[13:01:23] <danheberden> fonko, i appreciate your desire for colour
[13:01:27] <fonko> im gonna keep searching for this feature... i miss this very much !
[13:01:30] <fonko> hahaha thanks danheberden
[13:01:36] <BillCriswell> Haha
[13:01:40] <fonko> its a real big visual help, trust me
[13:01:55] <fonko> im losing my attention all the time... probably because of pot
[13:01:56] <Bothering> Eviltwin: i use geany
[13:01:56] <fonko> AHHA
[13:02:00] <danheberden> fonko i don't mix those things, so it's always a 'js' file or a 'html' file
[13:02:06] <BillCriswell> green text, black background, no syntax highlighting matrix style.
[13:02:08] <danheberden> but if i did, i'm sure i'd like that
[13:02:18] <BillCriswell> I also like the letters to blink on occasion
[13:02:22] <BillCriswell> and fall down the screen.
[13:02:27] <danheberden> BillCriswell: haha
[13:03:15] <BillCriswell> then I can scroll down to find them later if I need them... probably won't though.
[13:04:33] <s5fs> fonko: offset the pot with massive dosages of caffeine. can't say it'll fix the attention span issue but you'll dance more often.
[13:09:26] <joker_89> hi
[13:09:44] <joker_89> i have a change() funciton defined in ready document, how can i call it? manuall
[13:09:47] <joker_89> manually
[13:11:39] <joker_89> :?
[13:14:04] <grafi> change() ?
[13:14:26] <Bothering> :D
[13:14:35] <BillCriswell> joker_89: $el.trigger('change') works
[13:14:50] <Bothering> change();
[13:15:00] <NoiseEee> no Bothering
[13:15:07] <fonko> s5fs, haha i will do that hahahaha
[13:15:08] <Bothering> ?
[13:15:19] <NoiseEee> not el.change()
[13:15:37] <Bothering> huh
[13:15:52] <Bothering> just write change() under ur function
[13:18:53] <DOner> Is it kosher to have a div that gets .fadeOut(0) before $(document).ready() so that I ensure the div is faded out?
[13:23:45] <NoiseEee> DOner: just have the element set to display:none at page load.
[13:27:29] <Bothering> ya
[13:27:40] <Bothering> with a class
[13:27:46] <Bothering> think optimize
[13:27:47] <Bothering> !
[13:27:58] <Bothering> not lets see how much code i can cram in here
[13:29:09] <Bothering> DOner: youtube some bjarne strusup lectures
[13:29:24] <Bothering> very smart kid
[13:29:36] <Bothering> even tho its not javascript
[13:32:59] <culh> I have a user list on a ajax/jq chat app I made and all that's left to do is a methodology for refreshing the user list. Should I use setInterval() with recursive function or is there a better way?
[13:33:19] <Bothering> ok so if u think im wrong about every1 being a dick in here
[13:33:22] <Bothering> here
[13:33:30] <Bothering> google: why are IT people
[13:33:48] <Bothering> look at the autocomplete list box
[13:34:18] <failwell> hi
[13:35:04] <culh> Bothering: go to EFNET and find some real fucking jerks
[13:35:11] <Bothering> lol no
[13:35:15] <Bothering> dafuq
[13:35:25] <failwell> @culh... why do you want to do it recursive? oO
[13:35:37] <failwell> just start a timer.. and refresh it every minute or so..
[13:35:48] <failwell> it's not that often that users enter or leave..
[13:36:10] <failwell> other way would be: send commands from server to client.. make an add and a remove command.
[13:36:46] <culh> how?
[13:37:03] <culh> got any literature?
[13:37:06] <snover> cometd
[13:37:16] <failwell> i would use json data to separate the items u send..
[13:37:31] <failwell> one command part - and additional data that is sent with the command
[13:37:39] <failwell> for example
[13:37:45] <culh> how do you do a server to client request, without crappying out on flash?
[13:37:56] <failwell> you can do long therm requests..
[13:37:59] <culh> action script*
[13:38:19] <failwell> you can also send a request to the server every few seconds..
[13:38:27] <failwell> but then you have to save the data somehow on server.
[13:38:37] <culh> That's what I'm doing, need to refresh the chat elements also
[13:38:48] <Bothering> WAIT flash?
[13:38:56] <culh> flash blows
[13:39:05] <Bothering> i thot we were doing HTML5
[13:39:05] <failwell> when you send a request anyway to refresh, then just send additional data with it..
[13:40:01] <culh> failwell: I need a little studying on this, could you point me out a link or ...
[13:40:46] <failwell> i can make you short example code.. wait a second.
[13:41:40] <culh> cool
[13:45:40] <failwell> it's only sample code to give you a glue.
[13:46:34] <culh> ok
[13:47:21] <culh> pastebin?
[13:48:15] <failwell> http://pastebin.com/FCNBxDmn
[13:49:13] <failwell> since php or some server needs to handle the requests and you do that, i only show you how i would handle it in this important part
[13:49:31] <failwell> you then can use this array in javascript..
[13:50:07] <culh> noted
[13:50:19] <culh> thanks
[13:50:24] <failwell> np
[13:51:01] <failwell> notice json_encode.. it is your friend in sending arrays from php to javascript
[13:52:30] <culh> yeah, my main dificulty lies among the time comparisons. never used it before, but doens't seem alien though
[13:52:50] <culh> the js/jq part is straight forward
[13:53:39] <failwell> what do you mean with time comparison? if you mean message time - always use the servers one..
[13:54:15] <failwell> if you mean the requests: don't stress the server too much.. let time between the requests
[13:54:41] <failwell> you can set a timer for that.. for a chat that is not realtime important you can check every few seconds..
[13:55:23] <failwell> if you need more, use longterm calls, or change the system.. checkout websockets, too.
[13:56:45] <failwell> espacially free hosters or if you rent a small web package, the hoster will not love you and maybe kick you for generating too much traffic..
[13:57:01] <failwell> on a dedicated server, or vserver there shouldn't be a problem
[13:57:40] <zizzl> Is there a way to have a link that links to a certain pixel height on a website?
[13:57:51] <zizzl> like "scroll to 1000px"
[13:59:27] <failwell> make a div of 1000px height, then set an anchor after it and call that anchor is one way..
[14:01:47] <optiqal> zizzl: There is a good jquery scrolling plugin (scrollTo I think?) that will let you do this.
[14:01:56] <optiqal> It's like $.scrollTo('1000px')
[14:02:37] <zizzl> thanks
[14:04:04] <zizzl> optiqal is that built in or a plugin?
[14:05:37] <trepmal> back

[14:48:22] <Bothering> hola
[14:48:24] <Bothering> amigo
[14:48:27] <joker_89> hola bro
[14:48:33] <Bothering> que tal

[14:49:35] <joker_89> i want to reload some dependent queries using javascript , but the problem is thati need to update 3 dependen selects but need to get time to get the data from database
[14:49:50] <joker_89> how can i wait?
[14:49:54] <Bothering> use ajax
[14:50:03] <Bothering> then its oncomplete callback
[14:50:48] <joker_89> but i only use this when i update the page wiht some get parameters
[14:50:57] <joker_89> which are the id's
[14:51:19] <joker_89> oncomplete?
[14:52:05] <joker_89> Bothering como puedo hacer eso?
[14:52:29] <Bothering> tienes?
[14:53:07] <joker_89> Bothering how can i wait?
[14:53:12] <joker_89> for oncomplete
[14:53:38] <Bothering> jus alert something from complete
[14:53:40] <Bothering> ull see
[14:53:43] <Bothering> how it works
[14:53:49] <Bothering> there is also success
[14:53:52] <Bothering> and gail
[14:53:53] <Bothering> fail
[14:54:03] <Bothering> you should probly use success than complete
[14:55:15] <joker_89> no :S
[14:56:19] <Bothering> dun fite me on dis
[14:56:27] <DOner> Is there some jQuery for idiots channel? I don't want to ask my questions that should be super easy to answer here
[14:56:45] <Bothering> DOner: ask me
[14:56:52] <Bothering> im a idiot
[14:56:54] <failwell> don't ask to ask
[14:57:02] <Bothering> failwell: butt out thx
[14:57:08] <Bothering> im taking care of it
[14:57:14] <eternicode> DOner, a slow channel is the perfect place to ask stupid questions :D
[14:57:32] <Bothering> dood who u caling slow
[14:57:37] <Bothering> :O
[14:57:43] <eternicode> the channel.  I thought that was clear...
[14:57:55] <Bothering> the name is mentaly ill
[14:57:56] <eternicode> all 873 of you
[14:58:03] <joker_89> how can i wait until jquery ajax success is done?
[14:58:03] <Bothering> get it rite
[14:58:18] <Bothering> joker_89: its a callback
[14:58:20] <DOner> Ok, I'm pretty new to any kind of web developmen, so I don't know what is kosher and what you should/shoudln't do. But I am loading some php files into a div depending on which menu item is clicked, but obviously since I am doing that the 'back' and 'refresh' buttons won't work, is this the way I should even be doing it? or should I just template my pages out with my menu and change the main div to be what i need?
[14:58:27] <Bothering> just put ur code in there
[14:58:37] <Bothering> that u want executed
[14:58:42] <Bothering> after ur wait
[14:58:46] <Bothering> jesus
[14:59:25] <failwell> @Doner: a template system would be the best and most professional way.
[14:59:29] <joker_89> i want to first execute this that will fill the options of a select: $("#sel_phase").change(); and then use this to select one fo the options: $('#sel_subphase option[value="<?=$_GET['sel_subphase']?>"]').attr("selected", "selected");
[14:59:47] <failwell> dude..
[15:00:15] <failwell> don't use $_GET directly in the output...
[15:00:26] <Bothering> failwell: its fine
[15:00:30] <Bothering> let ppl code
[15:00:33] <Bothering> jfc
[15:00:40] <Bothering> asnwer his question
[15:00:47] <Bothering> not stray w ur pedancy
[15:01:03] <joker_89> Bothering do you have an answer?
[15:01:03] <Bothering> u gona give him the memory management next?
[15:01:11] <Bothering> joker_89: i gave it to u
[15:01:23] <eternicode> it's called "best practices".  get it rite.
[15:01:31] <Bothering> best prac my ass
[15:01:40] <joker_89> you say callbacks
[15:01:56] <Bothering> best prac of today is a shit pile of tomorow
[15:02:07] <Bothering> whoopty fkn doo
[15:03:03] <eternicode> joker_89, I think $('select').val('value') is enough to change a select's selected option.  Not sure, though.
[15:03:36] <Bothering> joker_89: break up ur question
[15:03:52] <Bothering> in lamens terms
[15:04:28] <eternicode> Bothering, that may be, but it's better than what came before. You don't like it, fine. The rest of us do.
[15:04:28] <eternicode> ramen terms
[15:05:14] <Bothering> eternicode: no its jus lame wen ppl chime in w a non answer
[15:08:07] <chinoto> I haven't ever really worried about memory consumption, only cpu performance. How would "$.each([1,2,3],function(k,v) {console.log(v^2);});" and "function anon(k,v) {console.log(v^2);}$.each([1,2,3],anon);" compare memory wise?
[15:08:23] <chinoto> I would image the former is better.
[15:08:28] <chinoto> imagine*
[15:09:44] <chinoto> Since the anonymous function doesn't have any reason to stick around.
[15:10:41] <joker_89> eternicode but i need to wait until select box is filled from ajax
[15:11:12] <eternicode> joker_89, put the call at the end of your success() callback?
[15:11:50] <eternicode> joker_89, a pastebin of your current code might help.
[15:13:39] <Bothering> dood
[15:13:44] <Bothering> i told u how to wait
[15:14:03] <Bothering> damit joker_89
[15:16:03] <joker_89> damit?
[15:17:43] <Bothering> alert('>.<');
[15:17:52] <Bothering> dats ur frend joker_89
[15:17:57] <Bothering> lol
[15:18:08] <Bothering> alert('>.-');
[15:29:44] <thekindlyone> anyone here who can help me with jquery to detect scroll to botoom?
[15:29:51] <thekindlyone> *bottom
[15:30:07] <thekindlyone> I am trying to detect scroll to bottom, it works here http://jsfiddle.net/w7X9N/339/   but not here http://dodomain.uni.me/rss.html where the div doesnt have text but the html from some rss. Help?
[15:36:42] <Patricia_> ah, turn those alerts off! use console.log or something!
[15:45:03] <dalnet22> How do I change the current cursor? I tried changing the body's cursor via css, but the cursor only changes once I've moved it. It doesn't change the current idle cursor.
[15:51:06] <Patricia_> what's the context? do you have a jsfiddle showing your proble?
[15:53:12] <dalnet22> no I'm working on a different solution. I'll let you know if I still need help with it.
[15:53:19] <shoky> dalnet22: i remember that was a bug in webkit/chrome
[15:53:28] <dalnet22> oh ok, yeah I'm using chrome
[15:54:12] <dalnet22> yep works fine in firefox
[15:54:25] <shoky> dalnet22: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=26723
[15:54:52] <Patricia_> http://jsfiddle.net/7CxQP/  (it changes on click at least)
[15:55:13] <dalnet22> shoky thanks
[15:55:50] <dalnet22> Patricia_ hmm
[15:55:57] <shoky> click != idle
[15:57:16] <Patricia_> ahh, that is true, i misread, i thought it only changed when you moved it
[15:57:57] <dalnet22> yeah mine changes when I move it, but it doesn't change on a mere keyup / keydown and no movement
[15:58:04] <dalnet22> due to the bug shoky showed
[15:58:36] <Patricia_> that's a pretty weird bug
[16:06:49] <Bothering> its not a bug
[16:06:52] <Bothering> its a feature
[16:18:36] <shoky> you're a feature
[16:33:17] <DOner> my php file just has echo json_encode(array("status" => 'OK'));, but when I try to alert with json.status in the "success" callback of my ajax call it shows it as undefined, do I need to do something different in my php file?
[16:36:16] <tw2113> why not try console.log instead of a pathetic alert :P
[16:36:55] <Eviltwin> Also try opening the URL for that PHP file in a browser
[16:37:05] <Eviltwin> And show us what you see there
[16:37:16] <charas> Hey guys! Could you be so kind to take a look at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2986690/Joldit%20Sao%20Paulo/test2.html and see why the content doesn't slide on "Are you a parking seeker"?
[16:37:30] <charas> It's sliding perfectly on the default slides
[16:38:16] <DOner> if I open it in my browser I get "{"status":"OK"}"
[16:39:49] <DOner> in the "success: function(data)...." part, does ti matter what I call data?
[16:39:54] <DOner> maybe that is the problem
[16:41:10] <RandalSchwartz> it's just an arg
[16:41:23] <RandalSchwartz> should be the same as whatever you use in the body of the function
[16:41:33] <DOner> I use data everywhere there too
[16:41:46] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ DOner
[16:41:47] <b-ot> DOner: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:41:48] <RandalSchwartz> then use data consistently :)
[16:42:53] <JcGood> hi everyone
[16:44:07] <Eviltwin> DOner: http://jsfiddle.net/XA3aJ/
[16:44:29] <Eviltwin> DOner: Also notice the dataType: "json"
[16:45:09] <tw2113> darn relative urls
[16:47:11] <DOner> I'm trying to get it into jsfiddle
[16:47:37] <tw2113> if it's not a localhost url, just point the full domain into the url property
[16:47:45] <DOner> it's localhost
[16:47:46] <Eviltwin> Question 1) Did you set dataType: "json"?
[16:47:50] <DOner> yes
[16:48:05] <JcGood> if user block javascript on his browser , jquery wont active function ?
[16:48:15] <Eviltwin> DOner: Okay, can you just pastebin the JavaScript / jQuery portion?
[16:48:29] <Eviltwin> JcGood: jQuery is JavaScript. When you are using jQuery you are using JavaScript
[16:48:34] <Eviltwin> JcGood: If JavaScript is blocked, so is jQuery
[16:48:50] <freebir> you guys, I need to create some sort of game, like some numerologic cards game, and I will need some animattion, I have Flash, can jquery help me ? What do you suggest ?? tks for your time
[16:49:13] <freebir> I mean I hate flash,
[16:49:17] <JcGood> ok like i thought , so we have to implements an another way to make something we want to do in html, beacuse if javascript is non activated its blocked
[16:49:19] <DOner> http://jsfiddle.net/4t6gZ/
[16:49:22] <DOner> here's a nonworking one
[16:49:30] <DOner> I'm trying to get a working example
[16:50:21] <Eviltwin> freebir: jQuery will not help you with Flash
[16:50:37] <tw2113> put the php file on a domain somewhere?
[16:50:59] <freebir> EvilEmpire, mal, I miss spelled, I meant I HATE flash, how can I get some annimation ? for my game that must go in a website online ??
[16:51:24] <Eviltwin> ?animate @ freebir
[16:51:34] <Eviltwin> Ugh, bot is gone
[16:51:35] <Eviltwin> freebir: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:53:01] <DOner> Crap, I need to go, I will revisit this tomorrow or something, thanks for the help
[16:55:08] <freebir> EvilEmpire, nice man, any other suggestion ?
[16:55:40] <Eviltwin> Well that's the tool that all jQuery-based animations are made with
[16:55:44] <Eviltwin> So not really, no
[16:56:10] <Eviltwin> Here's a simple demo of it in action: http://jsfiddle.net/P4tmE/
[16:58:17] <Eviltwin> I feel kinda bad for EvilEmpire. He's probably been targeted a dozen times in the last week by people trying to target me
[17:01:39] <chkpnt> Is it possible to use when(...) with an array of deferreds?
[17:02:28] <chkpnt> The number of deferreds is dynamic, therefore I cannot use multiple deferreds when(d1, d2, ...).done(...)
[17:03:03] <Eviltwin> chkpnt: Yes, you use .apply
[17:03:27] <Eviltwin> $.when.apply($, [def1, def2, def3, def4, ...]) becomes $.when(def1, def2, def3, def4, ...)
[17:03:46] <chkpnt> Uh, that's cool!
[17:03:51] <chkpnt> thanks
[17:04:58] <chkpnt> But isn't apply a JS-Function?
[17:05:42] * chkpnt has to read...
[17:07:43] <Eviltwin> Um............... yes......
[17:08:43] <chkpnt> I first thought you mean a special jQuery-apply-method ^^
[17:08:49] <Eviltwin> jQuery is JavaScript
[17:09:37] <chkpnt> Uh! ;-)
[17:09:50] <JcGood> EvilEmpire, if user disable javascript , we need to dev in html so ?
[17:10:08] <Eviltwin> So what? Why use JavaScript in the first place?
[17:10:22] <Eviltwin> Just use Flash or Java
[17:11:01] <chkpnt> Everything is evil
[17:11:36] <snover> hahaha. just use java, they CAN’T disable that
[17:11:40] <snover> oh wait
[17:13:16] <JcGood> no , im doing html
[17:13:21] <JcGood> but i lique to use jquery
[17:13:25] <JcGood> for dynamisme
[17:14:19] <Eviltwin> Are you a native english speaker?
[17:17:42] <JcGood> y
[17:20:46] <Eviltwin> "if user disable javascript , we need to dev in html so ?" is not actually a complete question or a complete sentence
[17:20:53] <Eviltwin> And I have no idea what you were trying to ask
[17:21:05] <Eviltwin> "dynamisme" is not a word and I'm not sure what you were aiming at
[17:21:18] <JcGood> yes sorry
[17:25:16] <chkpnt> Back to topic: $.when(d1,d2,d3).done(function() { console.log(arguments) }) ... as far as I understood "arguments", it should contain all arguments of the function. But in my tests it didn't work. Any hints?
[17:30:40] <Eviltwin> chkpnt: http://jsfiddle.net/BADFW/
[17:32:28] <Eviltwin> Seems to be working fine
[17:33:43] <fwe>  i was in project that was failing and as a result got my probation period extended. they said my programming skills were not that good. however an expert programmer was brought in and the project is still failing. the project manager and i had had an argument and that is why he tried to sabotage me. do you feel the boss knows the truth now?
[17:34:17] <Eviltwin> I'm going to be impressed if this can be turned into a jQuery question
[17:34:23] <EwokFartPorn> ^
[17:35:33] <EwokFartPorn> Anyway, so I was using jQuery on the project. How do I do this?
[17:35:34] <EwokFartPorn> lol
[17:39:08] <RRR2> When I was learning JavaScript, I found it fun, I thought that know that I "know" JavaScript then I could understand any webpage, I viewed the source code of some website and tried to read it (for learning purposes), I couldn't, it was jQuery, the one who was stopping me.
[17:40:55] <shoky> are you the expert programmer brought in to help with fwe's failing project
[17:41:04] <EwokFartPorn> ^
[17:41:26] <EwokFartPorn> My, have the tables turned. Now WE know.
[17:41:59] <Eviltwin> I liked you better when you were just pointing at my messages
[17:42:10] <EwokFartPorn> Haha!
[17:42:11] <shoky> lol
[17:43:18] <rainabba> I was about to close my IRC client, but this conversation is far too entertaining. Guess the reboot can wait :)
[17:44:29] <RRR2> ~e
[17:45:18] <fwe> can you guyz help me from being fired please?
[17:45:37] <Eviltwin> fwe: How do you propose we do that?
[17:45:39] <Eviltwin> We don't even know you
[17:45:42] <systemfault> I think you're fucked.
[17:45:53] <EwokFartPorn> fwe: Paste it in jsfiddle
[17:45:58] <RRR2> work for free
[17:45:59] <rainabba> ..and now the reboot isn't needed. Score. So I need to provide a jsFiddle case for a question I have but to keep my example as close to my code as possible, I need to retrieve json from a live source. Any recomendations?
[17:46:05] <fwe> yes systemfault economoy is very bad
[17:46:18] <fwe> i am fucked
[17:46:40] <systemfault> fwe: It's not about economy, it's about your manager throwing you under the bus to save himself.
[17:46:42] <rainabba> fwe: You have management problem, not a technical one :(
[17:46:50] <Eviltwin> rainabba: Look at Ajax Requests on the left
[17:46:56] <Eviltwin> Open the tab and click "read API documentation"
[17:46:58] <fwe> i lied in interview because high paying jobs.
[17:47:10] <rainabba> Eviltwin: Huh?
[17:47:11] <Eviltwin> Well sounds like you screwed up
[17:47:16] <fwe> i told them i know c++/java and matlab
[17:47:21] <fwe> they said great
[17:47:30] <Eviltwin> rainabba: Here: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[17:47:43] <systemfault> fwe: Well, they should have given you a technical test...
[17:47:53] <rainabba> Eviltwin: AH, on the left of jsFiddle. Why did you say so? :)
[17:47:54] <rainabba> ty
[17:48:21] <Eviltwin> fwe: Oh, so this project isn't even remotely jQuery related?
[17:48:48] <rainabba> Eviltwin: Did you hear him, JAVA :P
[17:48:54] <rainabba> ?
[17:49:00] <RRR2> technical test, like, FizzBuzz?
[17:49:03] * rainabba directs jwe to the topic
[17:49:28] <RRR2> JAVAscript
[17:49:49] <EwokFartPorn> I give up with humankind.
[17:50:07] <RRR2> That was kind of late
[17:50:12] <rainabba> EwokFartPorn: Funny. From your name I thought that was a foregone conclusion.
[17:50:22] <EwokFartPorn> XD
[17:51:14] <EwokFartPorn> RRR2: What was late?
[17:51:38] <RRR2> You, giving up on humanity.
[17:52:00] <EwokFartPorn> Yeah, I just wish people would understand the word relevance.
[17:54:03] <systemfault> They sure do get irrelevance...
[17:54:39] <EwokFartPorn> Can't say we didn't try.
[17:54:46] <EwokFartPorn> Oh, double negative.
[17:57:01] <oste> anyone know where to go for mozilla dev chat
[17:57:30] <oste> I found something rather annoying with -moz-box-sizing
[17:57:48] <systemfault> mozilla is on another network IIRC.
[17:59:02] <oste> irc.mozilla.org?
[17:59:05] <tw2113> ya
[17:59:13] <EwokFartPorn> oste: https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC
[17:59:32] <oste> ewokfartporn saw that
[18:00:04] <EwokFartPorn> There is hope in humanity.
[18:00:06] <EwokFartPorn> Thank you oste!
[18:00:40] <oste> thankyou fart porn
[18:01:06] <EwokFartPorn> oste: Haha, you're welcome. People were talking about irrelevant topics earlier.
[18:02:19] <oste> yeah i have noticed that this channel can go hay wire pretty quickly
[18:02:33] <tw2113> that's pretty much anyone, really
[18:02:33] <EwokFartPorn> Stay tuned!
[18:02:39] <tw2113> er any room
[18:02:54] <oste> ya
[18:03:00] <dalnet22> I've been trying to come up with the best way for users to hold down ctrl so that a new cursor appears, and then when I let go of ctrl the default cursor comes back. It seems simple, but due to the bug we found earlier with chrome, I'm having trouble making it work well.
[18:03:14] <oste> jquery can pretty much cover anything with enough imagination
[18:03:58] <EwokFartPorn> `paste
[18:03:58] <b-ot> EwokFartPorn: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:04:35] <RRR2> Can jQuery read and execute Windows executable files..?
[18:05:38] <tw2113> jQuery is primarily a DOM library
[18:08:58] <rainabba> Ok, so I'm trying to setup even the JSON example for JSFiddle at http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html and getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token new" on line 1 of http://jsfiddle.net/YPbz8/ Could I get a hand with this so I can understand how to use the echo feature so I can eventually as my own question? :)
[18:09:48] <rainabba> Looks like their sample has an error on 16 also (no # for the id for post).
[18:11:46] <shoky> rainabba: http://jsfiddle.net/YPbz8/1/
[18:12:14] <rainabba> Ty. I like that one more anyway.
[18:16:13] <shoky> rainabba: btw their examples use MooTools
[18:19:01] <rainabba> Ok. Now I think the issue isn't so much my JS as the data being returned. I'm returning an object (from ASP.Net webservice) that includes a property which is HTML. From the way the Chrome debugger is behaving, I suspect I need to do some escaping on the server before sending the results. :)
[18:19:32] <freebir> EvilEmpire, hey man, tell me something, this .animate you showed me wont do what I need, I need more than that, I think I'll have to seek for JS right ? any tip you could give me in this way ?
[18:21:11] <RRR2> It'd be fun to make a JavaScript compiler
[18:21:33] <slowhands> do it
[18:21:44] <RRR2> (like a compiler made in JS) like C++ compiler in javascript or something.
[18:21:56] <slowhands> ohh
[18:22:01] <RRR2> Yeah
[18:22:05] <slowhands> nvm
[18:22:10] <slowhands> lol
[18:22:41] <lenswipee> RRR2: Why reinvent the wheel?
[18:22:55] <RRR2> there is already one?
[18:23:00] <slowhands> have you used C++11 yet
[18:23:11] <slowhands> im jk
[18:25:00] <slowhands> remember when everyone used to use prototype
[18:25:51] <slowhands> or scriptaculous. is that still around?
[18:29:18] <RRR2> I've heard of prototpye, but not scriptaculous
[18:30:45] <shoky> memriess
[18:31:02] <shoky> misty water-colored memriesss
[18:31:33] <slowhands> mine are more like nightmares of activex
[18:31:46] <slowhands> and flash interop
[18:32:11] <shoky> we simply choose to forget
[18:32:29] <slowhands> and before that there was vbscript
[18:33:10] <slowhands> more like nightmares
[18:33:14] <slowhands> very hard to forget
[18:34:43] <shoky> sry bro
[18:34:57] <slowhands> yeah it was bad
[18:35:14] <tw2113> you young whippersnappers are spoiled when it comes to the DOM
[18:35:33] <slowhands> thats probably true
[18:36:27] <slowhands> i wonder what repelled developers from flash
[18:37:13] <slowhands> actionscript isn't much more difficult than js
[18:37:53] <slowhands> but flash applications were either lacking design or over-designed
[18:38:15] <tw2113> mobile revolution is at least part of it
[18:38:15] <lenswipee> slowhands: keep wondering...
[18:38:56] <hazardous> hi. does anyone know what the "generally accepted" tooltip plugin (pref. ajax) is nowadays?
[18:39:01] <hazardous> googling turns up a ton of them using 1.4, 1.5, etc
[18:39:16] <hazardous> my site is running 2.0.2 with a fallback to 1.10.1 for ie and the ones i find are just horribly broken
[18:39:24] <hazardous> much thanks in advance, appreciated
[18:39:24] <tw2113> maybe none of them are uptodate hazardous
[18:39:36] <hazardous> yeah, i figured
[18:39:42] <slowhands> css.hint
[18:39:46] <hazardous> there has to be something in use somewhere, but the top google results are just kinda ugh
[18:40:08] <hazardous> ooh, that's nice
[18:40:25] <slowhands> yeah fork it
[18:40:41] <RRR2> tooltip plugin?
[18:40:50] <hazardous> .data("hint", whatever) is the html5-data thing right?
[18:41:22] <slowhands> data attributes work in ie8
[18:42:03] <slowhands> I think with some shiv you can get them in most browsers
[18:42:55] <k_sze[work]> I'm using jQuery UI's autocomplete and have set a max-height on the autocomplete drop-down. Somehow the scrollbar is obscuring part of the items.
[18:43:03] <hazardous> i mean, all of my tooltips come from ajax
[18:43:40] <slowhands> but why
[18:44:08] <hazardous> has to pull info from elsewhere
[18:44:14] <hazardous> that i can't get onto the page itself
[18:44:20] <slowhands> ohh
[18:45:09] <hazardous> otherwise i'd be all over hint.css, so trying to figure out if i do some kind of jquery handler to do ajax and populate data-hint
[18:45:09] <slowhands> you could write your own. thats a fun project
[18:45:20] <slowhands> yeah tahts exactly
[18:45:23] <slowhands> what you should do
[18:45:29] <slowhands> should we take this to jsfiddle?
[18:45:42] <hazardous> that sounds hot, i have no idea how to write js or html though so time to break open w3schools
[18:45:58] <hazardous> i'm kind of curious why googling for tooltip stuff results in like
[18:46:00] <slowhands> ok but you'll need your ajax request
[18:46:03] <hazardous> i saw jquery 1.3 somewhere a while back
[18:46:14] <hazardous> i have no idea why that would be on the first page of google results still
[18:46:15] <slowhands> oh because tooltips mean different things to different people
[18:46:26] <slowhands> in different environments
[18:46:52] <hazardous> btw, this is probably an odd question
[18:47:00] <hazardous> but do you know where i can find some kind of guide that tells me how $(this) and this work
[18:47:13] <slowhands> yes
[18:47:18] <slowhands> well there are a variety
[18:47:28] <slowhands> but these guys at sync fusion keep emailing me
[18:47:35] <slowhands> about their docs
[18:47:45] <slowhands> they have one called jquery succinctly
[18:47:48] <slowhands> you might find it in there
[18:48:08] <slowhands> but what you are referring to is the context
[18:49:00] <slowhands> so if you did something like $("#mycooldiv").click(function(){ $(this).css('background-color','black'); })
[18:49:27] <slowhands> it refers to the object or function that the call (this) is enclosed
[18:49:46] <slowhands> if its not there it goes up another level
[18:50:10] <slowhands> now there is his book called javascript ninja or something by the jquery author
[18:50:14] <slowhands> its incredibly good
[18:50:19] <slowhands> explains closures perfectly
[18:51:41] <slowhands> http://amzn.com/193398869X
[18:51:59] <slowhands> probably the best since his other javascript book from 2006
[19:00:17] <rainabba> Hmm. Using 1.9.1 and my $.ajax call is failing before posting. I can see in jQuery.extend.ajax that s.traditional is undefined and as I trace through jQuery.param and buildParams that it is likely the problem, but I don't get an error until H.b._getBaseMethod which I've ONLY seen when using Telerik Kendo library and that turned out to be a bug on their part but was an issue with my return
[19:00:17] <rainabba> results, not data being posted (as I'm guessing it is right now). That too low-level to troubleshoot here? Anyone want to dig deep with me? :)
[19:00:34] <rainabba> I'm going to confirm somewhat by sending simplier data real quick.
[19:01:40] <shoky> wat
[19:02:47] <slowhands> do you have some code
[19:03:24] <slowhands> I'm not sure if i have the energy for that right now
[19:03:43] <shoky> didn't even say what the problem actually is
[19:04:32] <slowhands> prob something on the parameters
[19:04:36] <slowhands> before being sent
[19:04:45] <slowhands> maybe forgot to encode
[19:04:56] <shoky> guessing is futile
[19:06:00] <rainabba> Going to simplify a bit more before I share code
[19:07:49] <slowhands> guessing got me this far tho
[19:08:58] <rainabba> If the console wasn't taking 20+ seconds to do things, I'd be done :(
[19:10:21] <rainabba> There should be no difference in the $.ajax() call between using "data: { a:1 }" and "data: function() { return { a:1 } }" right?
[19:14:21] <Kimse> https://github.com/VinceG/twitter-bootstrap-wizard <-- How do i call this listed methods from withen an function attach to an event?
[19:14:28] <Kimse> this = the*
[19:14:59] <systemfault> rainabba: Two different things… unless jquery calls the function, it'd different
[19:15:30] <shoky> data  Type: PlainObject or String
[19:17:04] <rainabba> systemfault: ty. Can I pass a function as an object rather than an anonymous there? I use that approach with kendo.data objects (which are based on jQuery) and in my mind they should have worked the same :)
[19:17:29] <shoky> Kimse: i'd guess $(this).bootstrapWizard('methodname', args)
[19:17:36] <aFeijo> hey folks, how can I stop page from scrolling when div is scrolled to the bottom?
[19:17:49] <Lianzinho> hey guys, are there any ways to select jQuery UI Selectables just by clicking? Without need to hold Ctrl ?
[19:18:45] <shoky> Lianzinho: you can select them just by clicking..
[19:19:32] <Lianzinho> shoky: but they unselect the previous
[19:19:59] <shoky> Lianzinho: right.. that's another issue
[19:20:05] <Lianzinho> I need multiple selection just by clicking, and click again delesect
[19:20:07] <Lianzinho> hehehehe
[19:21:47] <Lianzinho> shoky: so, how? hehehe
[19:22:22] <shoky> Lianzinho: this looks promising.. http://stackoverflow.com/a/12592042/1098884
[19:22:23] <Kimse> shoky: it gives an error
[19:22:29] <Kimse> TypeError: this.data(...) is undefined
[19:22:29] <Kimse> return this.data('bootstrapWizard')[options](args);
[19:22:54] <Kimse> My call: $(this).bootstrapWizard('display', currentIndex);
[19:23:04] <shoky> Kimse: what event were you talking about? on a different element?
[19:24:47] <shoky> rainabba: maybe you meant..  data: (function() { return {a:1} })()
[19:25:04] <Kimse> shoky: line 9: http://pastebin.com/4wb0UCcA
[19:26:27] <shoky> Kimse: well why not  just  $('#signup-wizard').bootstrapWizard('display', currentIndex);
[19:27:08] <shoky> Kimse: or even  wizard.bootstrapWizard('display', currentIndex);
[19:27:28] <Kimse> trying to make it persistent, when refreshing the page
[19:29:17] <shoky> tho why would you call display on the current index, in the show event..
[19:29:36] <Kimse> Oh lol
[19:29:39] <Kimse> using wrong var
[19:29:44] <Kimse> i should be lastTab as arg lol
[19:29:54] <Kimse> it*
[19:30:46] <rainabba> shoky: Don't know that syntax. I see data:()() there. Can you direct me to more info please?
[19:31:41] <shoky> rainabba: it's an IIFE.  but it's just a shortcut for:    function myfunc() { return {a:1}; }        $.ajax({... data: myfunc() ...})
[19:31:57] <shoky> rainabba: just calling a function that returns an object
[19:32:07] <shoky> rainabba: in your example you weren't calling the function
[19:32:52] <shoky> rainabba: anyways no idea if that's what you need.. you've hardly given any info to work with
[19:34:28] <rainabba> shoky: Thank you. I know but that's because I'm getting stuck just trying to provide a useful example. :(  So basically (function() {}) is the inline declaration and the following () is effectively what says to call that declaration? How do I know when I need that vs what I was trying without the ()() ?
[19:34:30] <aFeijo> hey folks, how can I stop page from scrolling when div is scrolled to the bottom?
[19:35:10] <shoky> rainabba:  if you want to call the function, you need the () just like anytime you call a function
[19:35:33] <shoky> rainabba: without the () you're just passing a reference to the function. (instead of its return value)
[19:36:00] <shoky> rainabba: it's the difference between    data: myfunc()   and data: myfunc
[19:36:33] <shoky> rainabba: and $.ajax docs say that the data argument has to be an object or a string. not a function
[19:37:15] <rainabba> shoky: Gotcha. That's what I needed to hear. Apparently new kendo.data.DataSource() takes a function also then so I've been getting away with that.
[19:38:04] <shoky> shrugz
[19:38:23] <Eviltwin> Sounds like everything's under control here
[19:39:54] <shoky> i'm going to bed. stay frosty
[19:43:44] <rainabba> take care
[19:44:21] <EwokFartPorn> Have sweet dreams of /me
[19:52:48] <k_sze[work]> How do I identify the item that is triggering the focus in the autocomplete's focus event?
[19:53:50] <k_sze[work]> event.target gives me the autocomplete text input field, while event.currentTarget gives me the whole ul.ui-autocomplete.
[19:54:33] <slowhands> $('*:focus')
[19:54:58] <slowhands> that gives the currently focused el
[19:55:48] <Eviltwin> And is incredibly expensive
[19:56:03] <slowhands> well you would use it in a context
[19:56:06] <slowhands> not the entire page
[19:56:17] <Eviltwin> Then why'd you show it without a context?
[19:56:29] <slowhands> to guide to the right answer
[19:56:49] <Eviltwin> Yeah, when you tell someone $('*:focus') works, they're going to use $('*:focus') not use a context
[19:56:59] <k_sze[work]> slowhands: I don't think the <li> in the autocomplete drop-down is *really* receiving focus when I use the keyboard up/down keys.
[19:57:03] <slowhands> thats why i have you here
[19:57:20] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: Maybe you can try explaining this a little more
[19:57:31] <Eviltwin> You mean something's bringing the user to the input for the autocomplete?
[19:57:39] <Eviltwin> Or the user selects one of the options?
[19:58:12] <k_sze[work]> I have an <input type="text" id="foo"> that is turned into a jQuery UI autocomplete field $('#foo').autocomplete(...);
[19:58:21] <Eviltwin> With you so far
[19:58:44] <k_sze[work]> When I start typing, it shows the autocomplete drop-down, right? And I can use the keyboard arrow keys to select items in that drop-down.
[19:58:53] <Eviltwin> Sounds right
[19:59:40] <k_sze[work]> So I want to know, in the autocomplete's focus event, which item is being selected.
[19:59:55] <k_sze[work]> erm/selected/focused on.
[20:00:47] <k_sze[work]> I have tried to set a break point in the focus callback.
[20:01:38] <k_sze[work]> And it turns out that event.target is my <input id="foo">, whereas event.currentTarget is the whole autocomplete drop-down, not the single item in the autocomplete.
[20:01:52] <k_sze[work]> You see what I mean?
[20:03:37] <slowhands> yep
[20:03:41] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: http://jsfiddle.net/Pykf4/
[20:03:47] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: Like that?
[20:04:44] <k_sze[work]> oh, right
[20:05:02] <k_sze[work]> I completely forgot there's the ui argument to the focus callback.
[20:05:11] <k_sze[work]> thanks.
[20:05:15] <Eviltwin> Yup
[20:05:19] <k_sze[work]> I kept thinking about the the event argument.
[20:07:31] <slowhands> nice
[20:13:22] <gordian> anyone familiar with iScroll? http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4
[20:15:55] <Eviltwin> Nope
[20:16:03] <Eviltwin> Is this jQuery-related?
[20:16:18] <slowhands> can you already do this with jquery mobile?
[20:16:55] <gordian> Eviltwin: it might be
[20:17:05] <Eviltwin> I doubt it:P
[20:17:06] <gordian> i'm following the docs but not getting intended results
[20:17:17] <Eviltwin> I don't see jQuery on that page, I see JavaScript
[20:17:50] <gordian> i'm calling one of its functions in my jquery
[20:18:02] <gordian> err methods
[20:18:16] <Eviltwin> So loosely related to jQuery at best
[20:18:50] <gordian> perhaps
[20:23:18] <delboy1978uk> can anyone help with my flipswitch thing? its almost working except i can't seem to get the switch to switch off properly http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/ZqSVH/10/
[20:23:42] <Eviltwin> delboy1978uk: Is this like mobile only?
[20:23:56] <delboy1978uk> no this is desktop
[20:25:33] <delboy1978uk> it either isn't removing the checked attribute when you switch it off, or it is but its adding it again somehow
[20:26:56] <arschmitz> delboy1978uk: that seems really complicated for a basic flip check this out its much much more simple http://jsbin.com/uzaret/814/edit
[20:29:08] <Eviltwin> Does this work better? http://jsfiddle.net/ZqSVH/11/
[20:29:31] <delboy1978uk> yeah but the idea is you can make any checkbox or radio a flipswitch by saying $('.whatever').flipSwitch();
[20:29:46] <Eviltwin> This is still a lot of code
[20:29:47] <delboy1978uk> and pass it options
[20:29:50] <delboy1978uk> etc
[20:29:51] <Eviltwin> You really shouldn't need this much
[20:30:07] <delboy1978uk> well the bottom part is some other guys code
[20:30:26] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I'm talking about your portion
[20:30:27] <delboy1978uk> for animating background-position
[20:30:36] <slowhands> you should continue this switch component
[20:30:49] <slowhands> but fallback on images and use css gradients
[20:30:51] <delboy1978uk> because some browsers don't support background-position-x and y
[20:31:19] <slowhands> oh for sprites?
[20:31:34] <delboy1978uk> well kind of
[20:31:47] <slowhands> good idea too
[20:32:04] <delboy1978uk> the switch basically slides left and right and peeks in and out when you hover
[20:32:28] <delboy1978uk> its actually a remake of a really old jquery thing that used to work way back in the day
[20:32:43] <delboy1978uk> but the guy stopped maintaining it
[20:32:49] <slowhands> oh i see how it works
[20:33:14] <slowhands> see I would have used so much more markup
[20:33:21] <delboy1978uk> I'm just confused why it won't uncheck, thereby ruining the animation
[20:33:42] <Eviltwin> Did you try my version?
[20:34:30] <delboy1978uk> lol what did you change? :-)
[20:34:40] <delboy1978uk> prop?
[20:34:51] <slowhands> did you add those checked = checked comments?
[20:35:10] <delboy1978uk> yeah
[20:35:34] <delboy1978uk> just for illustration purposes
[20:35:45] <delboy1978uk> i knew it was something i was doing there
[20:37:35] <delboy1978uk> evilhands thanks so much! :-D
[20:37:50] <delboy1978uk> eviltwin even :-P
[20:38:05] <delboy1978uk> and cheers slowhands
[20:39:57] <delboy1978uk> thats it all working properly! how do i get it into the jquery plugins repository then? then everyone can have awesome custom flipswitches!
[20:40:12] <rainabba> Just wasted EASILY an hour because when calling $.ajax() against a .Net .asmx web service I forgot to include contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
[20:40:24] <delboy1978uk> lol
[20:40:30] <delboy1978uk> damn
[20:40:40] <rainabba> The service refused to parse my parameters correctly and I couldn't figure out why :(
[20:40:41] <systemfault> Heh… .net :/
[20:40:58] <delboy1978uk> I've just wasted an hour not knowing to use prop() instead of attr()
[20:41:27] <systemfault> Yeah.. you need to understand the difference between a property and an attribute.
[20:41:31] <rainabba> Actually, the fault is jQuery as far as I'm concerned bcause Kendo takes care of that for me but I didn't consider it because in my mind Kendo=jQuery+ :)
[20:41:33] <rainabba> Oops
[20:42:01] <slowhands> hmm where did Eviltwin go
[20:42:06] <slowhands> I wanted to know how he fixed that
[20:42:26] <rainabba> Either way, my mistake but now to bigger things!
[20:42:47] <slowhands> lol always good to consider all .ajax options
[20:42:59] <slowhands> esp with asp.net
[20:43:06] <slowhands> what a bastard of a framework
[20:43:20] <systemfault> I love C# though (Just the language)
[20:43:24] <delboy1978uk> what framework lol?
[20:43:37] <slowhands> asp.net core
[20:43:39] <_amg> Why would you use jQuery for flip switches...
[20:43:45] <delboy1978uk> yuk
[20:43:50] <slowhands> yuk is right
[20:43:58] <_amg> unnecessary code.
[20:44:15] <slowhands> maybe MVC or webapi would save you, but underneath it is till asp.net gross-ness
[20:44:16] <delboy1978uk> well yeah but it looks cool
[20:44:24] <slowhands> trust me I have to use it too sometimes
[20:44:37] <slowhands> wait until people start using Katana
[20:44:48] <slowhands> IIS web admins heads are going to explode
[20:44:49] <delboy1978uk> and $('.checkboxes').flipSwitch() aint a lot of code from now on
[20:45:08] <k_sze[work]> What css class does jQuery UI actually add to the item in an autocomplete field when it is focused (by keyboard or by mouse)? ui-state-hover? ui-state-active?
[20:45:13] <k_sze[work]> or both?
[20:46:03] <k_sze[work]> Kinda hard for me to inspect it in a browser inspector because the drop-down goes away as soon as I click something, even the inpector panel.....
[20:46:35] <slowhands> log the event
[20:46:45] <RandalSchwartz> I'm guessing both
[20:47:07] <RandalSchwartz> just set them to outrageous values, and yopu can tell
[20:47:34] <_amg> "and $('.checkboxes').flipSwitch() aint a lot of code from now on"
[20:47:50] <_amg> I could compile the same flip switches with 75% less code utilizing CSS...
[20:48:18] <delboy1978uk> sounds awesome i'd rather use that if you wrote it
[20:48:24] <_amg> including animation
[20:48:35] <Eviltwin> _amg: And why are you here exactly?
[20:48:54] <_amg> Eviltwin: To discuss realistic uses of jQuery and not redudant ones...
[20:48:58] <_amg> r u that dumb.
[20:49:39] <Eviltwin> Well everyone else is here to learn or teach constructively about jQuery
[20:49:58] <delboy1978uk> its not redundant till you write this css flipswitch and release it ;-)
[20:50:02] <Eviltwin> If you'd like to show delboy1978uk how he can make his switches in CSS that's one thing
[20:50:11] <delboy1978uk> yes please do
[20:50:16] <Eviltwin> If you want to just shit on his solution we don't really care for that stuff in here
[20:50:31] <_amg> http://proto.io/freebies/onoff/
[20:50:33] <_amg> http://colintoh.com/css3-flip-switch
[20:51:00] <_amg> http://ghinda.net/css-toggle-switch/#radio
[20:51:28] <delboy1978uk> those are awesome
[20:52:01] <_amg> Shit on solutions that shouldn't be built in jQuery in the first place, okay.
[20:52:08] <delboy1978uk> the second ones nice
[20:52:11] <_amg> ur super smart.
[20:52:14] <slowhands> just remember the markup increases as well
[20:52:22] <slowhands> probably a great usage for shadow dom
[20:52:41] <Eviltwin> _amg: Dude, be nice
[20:53:11] <slowhands> pure css implementations can be problematic though for legacy
[20:53:22] <slowhands> aka IE
[20:53:31] <Eviltwin> Like IE < 10
[20:53:36] <Eviltwin> Or in other words
[20:53:36] <slowhands> yeah lol
[20:53:38] <_amg> slowhands, jQuery can be just as bad especially behind a corporate network
[20:53:39] <_amg> .
[20:53:43] <Eviltwin> What everyone who uses IE uses
[20:54:08] <Eviltwin> _amg: The difference is that CSS3 animations they either have the support for or they don't
[20:54:18] <slowhands> I know that well _amg
[20:54:20] <Eviltwin> Whereas jQuery, while it can take some time to load, will work all the way back in IE6
[20:54:23] <Eviltwin> For animations
[20:54:26] <_amg> Eviltwin: You're kind of just being a tool...
[20:54:28] <_amg> the same goes for jQuery
[20:54:38] <Eviltwin> What same goes for jQuery?
[20:54:51] <tw2113> both are tools to get the job done?
[20:54:52] <_amg> Support or they don't
[20:54:55] <slowhands> he's saying that performance stinks on legacy
[20:54:57] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[20:55:05] <slowhands> which is like no shit sherlock
[20:55:09] <tw2113> Eviltwin, you're useful!
[20:55:13] <Eviltwin> I think almost every browser from the last decade supports jQuery
[20:55:13] <slowhands> but still supported
[20:55:20] <Eviltwin> Can't say the same for CSS3 animations
[20:55:21] <Eviltwin> Not even close
[20:55:22] <_amg> Eviltwin it's clear you don't professionaly build the web.
[20:55:31] <_amg> because you've never once in your life had to use a website behind a corporate network.
[20:55:33] <Eviltwin> It's clear you don't know what you're talking about :P
[20:55:34] <_amg> They don't support jQuery
[20:55:43] <slowhands> they do support jquery
[20:55:54] <Eviltwin> There's broader support for jQuery than for CSS3 by far
[20:55:54] <_amg> The networks I've been blessed with do no such thing
[20:55:56] <Eviltwin> It's just a fact of life
[20:55:59] <_amg> and I can only use HTML5 & CSS3
[20:56:01] <slowhands> I've worked at 2 huge enterprises
[20:56:04] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you're not particularly blessed
[20:56:29] * EwokFartPorn eats popcorn and watches.
[20:56:40] <slowhands> css3 is non-existent in the corporate world
[20:56:43] <Foxhoundz> Work for a startup
[20:56:47] <tw2113> i'm munching popcorn over your nick EwokFartPorn
[20:56:51] <Foxhoundz> you'll be much....saner
[20:56:59] <EwokFartPorn> lol
[20:57:00] <slowhands> and much poorer
[20:57:05] <slowhands> but thats ok
[20:57:07] <Foxhoundz> Not really
[20:57:20] <tw2113> html5/css3 is going to have worse support for corporate networks on ancient systems than jQuery will
[20:57:21] <Foxhoundz> I'm looking for an entry level web dev position
[20:57:23] <slowhands> nah ur probably right. i never worked at a startup
[20:57:28] <defk0n> Hey i am kinda new in jquery and after seeing the infini scroll from paul irish i was wondering if there is a framework that loads pages like that without ajax. https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll
[20:57:29] <Foxhoundz> and I'm seeing figures ranging from 40-80k
[20:57:34] <Foxhoundz> ( entry level)
[20:57:51] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Progressive loading requires communication back to the server
[20:57:58] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Which is most commonly accomplished with jQuery
[20:58:01] <Eviltwin> Err
[20:58:03] <Eviltwin> AJAX*
[20:58:06] <defk0n> yes i know that.
[20:58:10] <slowhands> aka lazy load
[20:58:15] <defk0n> but this is diffrent, it doesnt use ajax
[20:58:22] <defk0n> jquery .load();
[20:58:29] <Eviltwin> Ah, that does use AJAX
[20:58:31] <Foxhoundz> tw2113:  Microsoft and Visual Studio have begun embracing open technologies
[20:58:33] <slowhands> thats actually an ajax call
[20:58:41] <Eviltwin> defk0n: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:58:44] <tw2113> what about that Foxhoundz
[20:58:57] <slowhands> damn you're too fast Eviltwin
[20:58:59] <slowhands> I'm going to bed
[20:59:01] <Eviltwin> defk0n: It's wrapped up but there's AJAX happening under the hood
[20:59:39] <Foxhoundz> tw2113: A lot of corporate software is written in the (ASP).NET family of languages. Back in the day these developers simply used whatever means necessary to display data on the browser (table-based layouts, lots of alerts(), etc.)
[20:59:49] <Foxhoundz> But they're really starting to embrace open technologies
[20:59:58] <tw2113> asp.net isn't the part in question though
[21:00:04] <Foxhoundz> Yes yes
[21:00:05] <tw2113> it's the browsers/versions they use
[21:00:10] <slowhands> WebForms lol
[21:00:16] <tw2113> in these corporate environments
[21:00:28] <tw2113> asp.net isn't going to add browser support
[21:00:34] <slowhands> theres a reason for that. nobody knows of the <meta tag for compatibility
[21:00:37] <defk0n> nope, there isnt. its a smart client vs dumb server, the server responds the page. but the javascript parses out a selector. its not ajax in the traditional sense. it would ease development if i could build upon that dynamic.
[21:00:42] <slowhands> so they just emulate IE5
[21:00:42] <Foxhoundz> Sharepoint supports the latest browsers, for example
[21:01:06] <Eviltwin> defk0n: It's AJAX in the sense that it use the XmlHttpRequest to fetch content
[21:01:09] <Eviltwin> defk0n: That's what AJAX is
[21:01:33] <tw2113> sharepoint isn't a browser Foxhoundz
[21:01:38] <Foxhoundz> sigh
[21:01:38] <Eviltwin> It's fetching an HTML page and pulling content out of it but that's after it's done the AJAX business
[21:01:41] <Eviltwin> Which is still required
[21:01:47] <Foxhoundz> I never said it was, tw2113
[21:01:52] <slowhands> dek0n: believe it or not that is AJAX in the traditional sense
[21:02:08] <tw2113> well at least i thought we were talking browsers in the corporate snails
[21:02:18] <defk0n> oh like that. oke. is there a framework that does it like that. although i know its could be a waste of bandwith. i would like to temp install it like that while working on the backend providing json etc
[21:02:36] <slowhands> basically that is how ajax was used before RESTful took over
[21:02:44] <Eviltwin> defk0n: You can just use .load()
[21:02:47] <Eviltwin> I linked you the page
[21:02:50] <Foxhoundz> tw2113: Sharepoint is a multifaceted corporate application that is accessed through a browser
[21:03:03] <slowhands> stfu about share point. its the worst
[21:03:03] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Read all about it here: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[21:03:06] <tw2113> that's nice
[21:03:12] <tw2113> Foxhoundz, apples and oranges here
[21:03:15] <defk0n> hmm
[21:03:25] <tw2113> however
[21:03:28] <slowhands> and so is the 9-5 job. just go get paid and do the work
[21:03:30] <Foxhoundz> tw2113: the point I was trying to make was that it supports the latest web technologies in the front-end
[21:03:37] <tw2113> it sounds like you're trying to say it's some sort of vm layer of sorts?
[21:03:38] <Foxhoundz> So I don't see how this is apples and oranges
[21:03:42] <Foxhoundz> no...
[21:03:49] <tw2113> chrome frame style?
[21:03:57] <slowhands> chrome frame is gone btw
[21:04:00] <Foxhoundz> Think of wordpress.
[21:04:01] <tw2113> i know
[21:04:04] <slowhands> kind of bummed out about that
[21:04:08] <Foxhoundz> It's more like Joomla or Wordpress
[21:04:10] <Foxhoundz> or Drupal
[21:04:13] <Foxhoundz> now you get it?
[21:04:14] <slowhands> I thought that was going to save the enterprise
[21:04:14] <Eviltwin> I think we can all that on average corporations have out of date hardware and software
[21:04:17] <Eviltwin> Now can we move on?
[21:04:27] <slowhands> yes
[21:04:28] <tw2113> adding WordPress or Joomla to your browsing history won't make the browser support javascript
[21:04:39] <tw2113> so, no, i don't get what you're trying to say still
[21:04:43] <Foxhoundz> Too bad.
[21:04:49] <slowhands> lol thats a ridiculous statement
[21:04:50] <tw2113> javascript...css3...html5
[21:04:59] <Eviltwin> Actually..........
[21:05:00] <Foxhoundz> He's just trying to troll
[21:05:01] <Eviltwin> Hmm...
[21:05:06] <Eviltwin> It's be inefficient as hell
[21:05:09] <tw2113> no i'm trying to make sense of wtf you're saying
[21:05:22] <Eviltwin> But I think you could write something in JS to polyfill certain CSS3 abilities
[21:05:27] <Foxhoundz> Good god.
[21:05:29] <tw2113> sharepoint is NOT going to make something like IE6 support something like border-radius
[21:05:43] <Eviltwin> Using awful shims
[21:05:57] <slowhands> yeah definitely. and there are many polyfills and they get worse and worse
[21:06:03] <tw2113> polyfills are js
[21:06:05] <Foxhoundz> I wasn't talking about IE6. I was just dispelling this popular notion that corporate apps today still use arcane technologies
[21:06:08] <tw2113> imitating css3
[21:06:13] <tw2113> it's not making it support css3
[21:06:25] <Foxhoundz> And I was using Sharepoint as an example
[21:06:26] <Eviltwin> Well not always imitating CSS3 but yes, I know
[21:06:28] <tw2113> now we're on the same page a bit more Foxhoundz
[21:06:31] <Foxhoundz> no
[21:06:33] <Foxhoundz> I was on the page
[21:06:35] <Foxhoundz> you were in China.
[21:06:36] <Foxhoundz> :|
[21:06:39] <tw2113> bullshit
[21:07:09] <defk0n> how can i execute js/jquery on any clicked href?
[21:07:21] <Eviltwin> While many corporate apps have been dressed up with a light dusting of new technologies
[21:07:26] <tw2113> plain and simple we were NOT on the same page
[21:07:31] <Eviltwin> A lot of them still have their roots in horrible, old, bad practices
[21:07:34] <tw2113> regardless of where you think proximity was
[21:07:43] <Foxhoundz> defk0n: $('#element').on'('click'...
[21:07:44] <slowhands> like flash, and java applets
[21:07:46] <snover> man, so much bleating in here
[21:08:22] <tw2113> i was talking browser supporting X browser, you were talking about X corporation being at Y tech use
[21:08:30] <systemfault> defk0n: $(document).on("click", "a[href]", function(event) { doSomething(); });
[21:09:31] <Eviltwin> defk0n: http://jsfiddle.net/CeWSn/
[21:09:38] <Eviltwin> defk0n: This uses what is called event delegation
[21:09:47] <Eviltwin> Which means it binds one click listener to the top of the document
[21:09:51] <systemfault> I win!
[21:09:59] <Eviltwin> And relies on event bubbling to detect if the click
[21:10:03] <systemfault> Even if Eviltwin's answer is so much niver
[21:10:05] <systemfault> *nicer
[21:10:07] <Eviltwin> systemfault: Yeah but mine actually works ;P
[21:10:14] <systemfault> :'(
[21:10:56] <Foxhoundz> You're all correct
[21:10:59] * Foxhoundz hands out gold stars
[21:11:14] <Eviltwin> Can I get the cash value of a gold star instead?
[21:11:17] <defk0n> i think you guys see where i am going here :D would this ajaxifiy my page? $(document).on("click", "a[href]", function(event) {  	$('#container').load('ajax/' + this.href);   });
[21:11:40] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Depending on how your page works, it might
[21:11:50] <Eviltwin> One warning is that this.href is an absolute URI
[21:11:56] <Eviltwin> Meaning it's http://...../ etc
[21:11:57] <slowhands> what about $('a[href').click(function(e){ . . . })
[21:12:11] <Eviltwin> slowhands: That involves attaching a bunch of listeners all over the DOM
[21:12:12] <slowhands> is that less perf?
[21:12:17] <Eviltwin> Much less perf
[21:12:21] <slowhands> got it
[21:12:26] <slowhands> context
[21:12:26] <Eviltwin> And also won't work if he dynamically adds new a's
[21:12:27] <systemfault> Not just perf..
[21:12:32] <systemfault> Eviltwin++
[21:12:34] <slowhands> zombies too?
[21:12:54] <slowhands> well yeah then I guess id use .live
[21:12:59] <Eviltwin> defk0n: If you want what's literally in the <a href="...">
[21:13:02] <systemfault> .live is dead
[21:13:06] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Use $(this).attr("href")
[21:13:09] <slowhands> .on?
[21:13:11] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:13:13] <defk0n> i have  a container that loads the majority of the stuff, i would prolly make multiple of those, for navigators etc
[21:13:13] <defk0n> $(document).on("click", "a[href]", function(event) {  	$('#container').load('ajax/' + this.href);   });
[21:13:15] <defk0n> sry
[21:13:18] <slowhands> i forget sometimes
[21:13:24] <defk0n> misclick ctr v
[21:13:24] <Eviltwin> The syntax we showed is the better version of .live
[21:13:29] <systemfault> slowhands: .on has 2 syntaxes… one being the same as .live
[21:13:36] <slowhands> yeah .on is the way to go
[21:13:58] <slowhands> so many different versions. i get flummoxed
[21:14:05] <defk0n> $('#container').load('ajax/' + $(this).attr("href")); ?
[21:14:11] <slowhands> rather deprecation
[21:14:57] <Eviltwin> defk0n: So for a click on <a href="main.html"> that will fetch ajax/main.html and replace the contents of #container with everything in ajax/main.html
[21:14:57] <slowhands> defk0n: are you trying to load a partial?
[21:15:11] <defk0n> yep yep eviltwin
[21:15:32] <defk0n> slowhands what does that mena
[21:15:42] <slowhands> a partial bit of html
[21:15:43] <Eviltwin> He means are you trying to get just a piece of that page
[21:15:50] <Eviltwin> Or do you actually want the whole thing
[21:16:10] <defk0n> yes the container loads the majority of the stuff. (gallery)
[21:16:26] <Eviltwin> Well then it looks like you're all set
[21:16:31] <defk0n> its like the body/container/blabla
[21:16:35] <defk0n> yep gnna try it out
[21:17:05] <defk0n>   //body/container/blabla
[21:17:10] <Eviltwin> If there's also a #container on ajax/main.html (or whatever) and you just want to load that chunk, you can do $('#container').load('ajax/' + $(this).attr("href") + ' #container');
[21:17:38] <slowhands> thats what id do if its a full html page
[21:18:21] <slowhands> maybe not I don't know. its circumstantial
[21:18:25] <defk0n> ohhhh so this $('#container') is the parent dom, and this .load('ajax/' + $(this).attr("href") + ' #container'); the child?
[21:18:40] <defk0n> so to speak
[21:18:59] <defk0n> yer that might save me some bandwith
[21:19:12] <defk0n> LOL
[21:19:16] <slowhands> that would be a partial selection
[21:19:23] <slowhands> you bring back only the element you need
[21:19:31] <slowhands> after the load occurs
[21:19:36] <slowhands> I don't think you save bandwidth
[21:19:44] <defk0n> yer i loled on second thought.
[21:19:45] <slowhands> Evil?
[21:20:10] <slowhands> I used what you're doing in php
[21:20:23] <slowhands> but in the file i was loading i'd put only the markup i wanted to bring in
[21:20:25] <Eviltwin> Yeah, it doesn't save bandwidth
[21:20:41] <slowhands> like <div id="container>.. .</div>
[21:20:46] <slowhands> and that would be the whole file
[21:21:06] <slowhands> no head no body no html tags even
[21:21:26] <defk0n> i think this method, would be preferred if you are thinking about seo instead of high dynamics
[21:21:29] <defk0n> good compromise
[21:22:01] <slowhands> possibly. I'm not really an expert on either
[21:22:25] <slowhands> look at a template library as well
[21:22:28] <Eviltwin> Yeah, most seach engines don't work well when there's JavaScript involved
[21:22:45] <slowhands> it could save you some work, maybe not in this case, but similar cases
[21:25:18] <defk0n> holy shit, it works. this is 2 legit
[21:25:37] <_amg> jQuery works fine for this task in regards to SEO
[21:26:35] <defk0n> but the url changes also. in the titlebar. does that say something, ithought it would just stay the same. after clicking it changes the link also
[21:26:37] <defk0n> :/
[21:26:54] <_amg> As long as there's a sitemap and you're just calling the content area from the other pages
[21:27:02] <Eviltwin> Oh, you want to prevent default
[21:27:38] <defk0n> no i like it like this, but its working then?
[21:27:39] <_amg> defk0n: with JS or PHP?
[21:27:40] <defk0n> thats a setting
[21:27:46] <_amg> My JS script isn't changing the URL
[21:27:57] <defk0n> hmm, its php/js
[21:28:17] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Right now I think it's as if the .load()'s not happening at all
[21:28:27] <Eviltwin> Unless you're calling preventDefault() on the event
[21:30:13] <defk0n> hmm yer it isnt working  for  :/
[21:30:22] <defk0n>  $(document).on("click", "a[href]", function(event) {  	$('#all').load('ajax/' + $(this).attr("href") + ' #all');   });
[21:30:34] <Eviltwin> In that function do event.preventDefault() as well
[21:33:44] <defk0n> hmm , not working. i am using jquery-1.6.1
[21:34:23] <Eviltwin> Are you getting errors on the console?
[21:34:59] <defk0n> TypeError: $(...).on is not a function [Break On This Error] 	  $(document).on("click", "a[href]", function(event) {
[21:35:17] <Eviltwin> Oh, right, super old jQuery
[21:35:27] <defk0n> 1.6.1
[21:35:31] <Eviltwin> Like I said
[21:35:37] <defk0n> oh :$
[21:35:47] <Eviltwin> Do $(document).delegate("a[href]", "click", function () { ... })
[21:35:48] <Eviltwin> Instead
[21:35:50] <Eviltwin> It does the exact same thing
[21:36:17] <defk0n> which jquery should i use? if its that decaprated
[21:36:36] <defk0n> decapritated
[21:36:55] <defk0n> LOOOl
[21:36:57] <Eviltwin> 2.0.2?
[21:37:00] <defk0n> you know what i mean
[21:37:09] <tw2113> the latest stable version?
[21:37:53] <Eviltwin> 2.0.2 doesn't support IE 8 or earlier
[21:38:01] <tw2113> as it shouldn't
[21:38:05] <tw2113> 1.9 then
[21:38:06] <Eviltwin> So if you want to support those I suggest 1.10.1
[21:38:08] <systemfault> jquery has 2 latest versions :P
[21:38:10] <tw2113> or that
[21:38:13] <tw2113> i forgot they moved to 10
[21:38:18] <Eviltwin> Yeah :\
[21:41:20] <Cache_Money> can anyone point me in the direction of how I would go about mimicing Netflix's onhover tooltip? (front-end newb)
[21:42:12] <defk0n> works, how do i get the inner element of my div instead of "the" div
[21:43:08] <Eviltwin> The one from the existing document or the one you're loading?
[21:43:26] <defk0n> the one i am loading
[21:43:35] <defk0n> its basically the container of the whole site.
[21:46:48] <aFeijo> folks, I have a div that if clicked it will resize, and that div has a image that if clicked should open a fancybox(), the fancybox works only if I do not have the click at the div. I try to use stopPropagation but didnt work, what is the trick here?
[21:48:10] <Eviltwin> defk0n: I'd do something like this: http://pastebin.com/qLH7nz79
[21:48:13] <Eviltwin> Which is how .load() is implemented
[21:50:05] <fella5s> when i have one js file for my webapp. If i have $("#this_id_does_not_exists_in_this_page").on('mouseenter'... etc does it slowdown anything? or is it ignored as that id does not exist in that page?
[21:50:45] <defk0n> hmm thnx, what is this $("<div>")?
[21:50:46] <Eviltwin> It's ignored
[21:50:50] <Eviltwin> Sort of
[21:50:59] <Eviltwin> defk0n: It creates a new <div> element
[21:51:07] <Eviltwin> That's in a separate document
[21:51:27] <defk0n> does it needs to?
[21:51:37] <defk0n> to function
[21:51:59] <Lianzinho_> whats substitutes the .live?
[21:52:10] <Eviltwin> Lianzinho_: .on's event delegation notation
[21:52:17] <Eviltwin> defk0n: It's the best way
[21:52:38] <Lianzinho_> I mean, I want to add an element on the fly and I want the lenght of its selector to iterate by 1, what should I do?
[21:52:52] <Eviltwin> Lianzinho_: I.....I have no idea what that means
[21:53:12] <systemfault> Give him viagra..
[21:53:14] <systemfault> :/
[21:53:31] <tw2113> not the best way for solutions to pop up systemfault
[21:54:31] <systemfault> tw2113: I waiting for his answer to Eviltwin's question :)
[21:54:36] <systemfault> *I'm
[21:54:40] <defk0n> this, http://pastebin.com/42YgxHwem gives me SyntaxError: invalid label [Break On This Error] 	  success: function (data) {
[21:54:55] <systemfault> defk0n: Link is not working
[21:55:08] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: imagina I have two divs ... so that $('div').length == 2 right? I want to make a button that will append another div to the DOM and so  $('div').length == 3 ...
[21:55:15] <Lianzinho_> *imagine
[21:55:17] <Eviltwin> defk0n: $.ajax({ not $.ajax(function() {
[21:55:25] <defk0n> http://pastebin.com/42YgxHwe
[21:55:34] <Eviltwin> Lianzinho_: Okay...
[21:55:48] <Eviltwin> I screed up
[21:55:51] <Eviltwin> screwed*
[21:56:08] <Eviltwin> I meant to send http://pastebin.com/GBgt6QKm
[21:56:43] <systemfault> Lianzinho_: Why do you care about the length?
[21:57:35] <Lianzinho_> systemfault: because I need to do some calculations based on how many of those elements are there
[21:58:02] <Lianzinho_> systemfault: the idea is, add them on the fly, and have the right number to do the calculations
[21:58:39] <systemfault> There's no way to do that.
[21:58:43] <Eviltwin> If you add a new div to the DOM then it will be matched by $('div') and show up
[22:00:09] <Eviltwin> Lianzinho_: http://jsfiddle.net/Z3ySh/
[22:00:10] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: so.. if I have a function that counts how many divs are there... If I create a button to add a new div, this function will count this one?
[22:00:37] <Eviltwin> If you add a new div, new queries for the number of divs will include it
[22:00:39] * tw2113 can't think of one reason why .on() won't work for Lianzinho_ 
[22:01:10] <systemfault> tw2113: Must be the classic "I need to do something on DOM node insertion"
[22:01:42] <Lianzinho_> tw2113: what should be the right event to use, then...
[22:01:55] <tw2113> .on('click', function(){ });
[22:02:33] <defk0n> evilTwin http://pastebin.com/AUuJcgBf
[22:03:12] <systemfault> Lianzinho_'s problem… http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem
[22:04:25] <Lianzinho_> hahahaha
[22:07:03] <delboy1978uk> eviltwin heres the flipswitch plugin https://github.com/delboy1978uk/flipswitch
[22:10:33] <defk0n> Eviltwin, got it working! http://pastebin.com/ZqLmYvtn
[22:10:39] <defk0n> with your div replace
[22:11:05] <defk0n> now i just need to pretty it up a bit with some fades
[22:11:11] <defk0n> and good 2go
[22:12:23] <Eviltwin> And I just finished a demo of it "working": http://jsfiddle.net/6ujgD/
[22:13:49] <defk0n> hmm but it seems like my function dupes the styling. everytime i load i get double borders. even without the div loaded visibly
[22:15:25] <Eviltwin> Are you using Chrome or Firebug or something
[22:15:29] <Eviltwin> Can you poke at the elements
[22:15:37] <Eviltwin> And see if something's getting duplicated
[22:15:54] <defk0n> firefox /firebug
[22:16:07] <Eviltwin> Can you inspect the DOM after it runs
[22:16:31] <tw2113> s/can/will
[22:17:42] <otiuk> what's the best way to send the full contents of a form to the server using .ajax?  i just want to send all filled out form fields to the server and have the server side script parse it all
[22:18:00] <Eviltwin> otiuk: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[22:19:03] <otiuk> oh nice
[22:28:33] <defk0n> Eviltwin, yer my function was not working after all. it emptied the #all. without removing
[22:28:35] <defk0n> it just refilled it
[22:28:49] <defk0n> at the bottom
[22:28:56] <Eviltwin> Oh, you may want to check out replaceWith
[22:29:03] <Eviltwin> If you want to remove the original #all
[22:32:45] <Lianzinho_> any idea on why $('.square:last-child').remove(); is not working in something as simple as <div class="square"></div><div class="square"></div> ?
[22:33:33] <jeremy-> Trying to use jquery ui's native auto-complete I have some json I'm querying that has 3 values per line. When i try and output just one of the 3 values as return { value: object.data } for some reason it automatically creates 3 autocomplete entries instead of 1
[22:33:54] <jeremy-> anyway i can just have 1 autocomplete line per json group
[22:34:56] <Eviltwin> Lianzinho_: http://jsfiddle.net/ApXHK/
[22:35:02] <tw2113> Lianzinho_, just did a console.log of $('.square:last-child') and it's returning a length of 0
[22:35:33] <uknownalgorithms> I'm using this toggle code to open and close a div. But how can i make it so only one div can be open at a time? $(document).on("click", ".tophalf", function () { 	$(this).next().toggle("fast"); });
[22:35:36] <tw2113> at least with jsbin
[22:36:05] <Lianzinho_> tw2113: yes... why? Should it?
[22:36:12] <tw2113> dunno
[22:36:17] <tw2113> just reporting what i saw actually happening
[22:36:43] <macmartine> uknownalgorithms: close all of 'em before opening the new one
[22:37:12] <macmartine> uknownalgorithms: or add a data attribute to the open one, the find that and close it before opening a new one
[22:38:49] <uknownalgorithms> would i have to give the toggled divs a css id and .css display none that
[22:38:54] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/XcDXg/
[22:39:01] <Lianzinho_> it does nothing
[22:39:21] <Eviltwin> So where's that $('.square:last-child')?
[22:39:56] <Cache_Money> has anyone used the qtip library lately? http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/docs/
[22:39:56] <Lianzinho_> inside the last function, binded to the .remove button
[22:40:35] <Eviltwin> Lianzinho_: There's one function here
[22:41:46] <macmartine> uknownalgorithms: I'd put a class on all the toggle-able divs. Then before you open one, call $('.toggle').hide()
[22:41:58] <Cache_Money> I'm trying to figure out why this isn't working. http://pastie.org/8061967
[22:42:23] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: yes, when I click the button, it should get the last and remove it, isn't it?
[22:43:57] <Lianzinho_> Cache_Money: really need this ./ in the src= ? Try just putting the name of the file...
[22:45:20] <Cache_Money> Lianzinho_: it's failing to load the jquery file from Google, as well as my local qtip library :/
[22:45:26] <Eviltwin> Cache_Money: Well the script shouldn't be after the body
[22:45:29] <Eviltwin> Just at the bottom
[22:45:44] <macmartine> Cache_Money: http://jsfiddle.net/NF6CP/
[22:50:29] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: so, the function is messing with something? I don't understand why it's not working
[22:51:22] <Eviltwin> I don't understand what your definition of working is
[22:51:46] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: it's not removing the last child
[22:51:55] <Eviltwin> Dude, I just showed you it working
[22:52:03] <Eviltwin> You should me some code that does not use the last-child selector
[22:52:31] <Lianzinho_> does not? how
[22:52:41] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/XcDXg/
[22:52:53] <Eviltwin> "last-child" does not occur anywhere in here
[22:53:46] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: duh! sorry! that was a previous version: http://jsfiddle.net/XcDXg/1/
[22:53:59] <Lianzinho_> I took the wrong link
[22:54:08] <Lianzinho_> it's there, the last thing in the js
[22:56:12] <Eviltwin> Lianzinho_: You have two event handlers that are firing here
[22:56:36] <Eviltwin> The $('.remove') one removes one and the $('button') one adds a new one back
[22:57:00] <Eviltwin> Lianzinho_: http://jsfiddle.net/XcDXg/2/
[22:59:05] <Erma> Hi all, Please check the url http://applicate.co.nz/website/indexnew.html. My doubt is that is it possible to maintain the history of pages. Please help, thanks.
[23:00:24] <Cork> Erma: what is the question
[23:00:38] <macmartine> Erma: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[23:00:46] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: ah, the 'button' wasn't making any distinction right? Was firing for both
[23:00:54] <Eviltwin> Yup
[23:01:05] <Eviltwin> That's how CSS selectors work
[23:01:18] <Eviltwin> $('button') meant it was attached to all <button> elements
[23:02:16] <Lianzinho_> Eviltwin: yeah, I know, I forgot this, I was using just one button, just had the idea to add the other one later. I should never select on tag names afterall
[23:02:19] <Lianzinho_> thanks!
[23:02:24] <defk0n> Is there a alternative to find(div).contents(); i need to get the nodelist without actually outputting the div
[23:02:30] <Lianzinho_> I can go sleep now... hehehe
[23:02:34] <defk0n> :/ shits driving me crazy
[23:03:00] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[23:03:09] <Eviltwin> And alternative that does the same thing or something else?
[23:05:15] <Erma> cork: I created website not as single page application. Just divs that is hidden and gets active on click. My question is that, is it possible to make it maintain history of those divs like which i clicked last and when i refresh i get the same page ( i mean div)?
[23:05:16] <defk0n> yer the same thing

[23:06:26] <defk0n> this is what i have right now, and it empties my parent #all but still inputs a child #all
[23:06:38] <defk0n>  this is what i have right now, and it empties my parent #all but still inputs a child #all http://pastebin.com/7WEXjXwE
[23:07:25] <Cork> defk0n: .load doesn't work like that
[23:07:41] <Cork> .load will insert the contetn of the request in #all
[23:07:50] <defk0n> hmm. how do i stop doing that
[23:07:56] <Cork> and fragment won't be the new content
[23:08:03] <defk0n> or am i just stubborn and did Eviltwin already gave me the anser huehuehue
[23:08:04] <Cork> ?.get
[23:08:09] <Cork> `get
[23:08:13] <defk0n> get?
[23:08:13] <Erma> Cork : I created website not as single page application. Just divs that is hidden and gets active on click. My question is that, is it possible to make it maintain history of those divs like which i clicked last and when i refresh i get the same page ( i mean div)?
[23:08:19] <Cork> bah both bots are down...
[23:08:36] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Yah, use the other solution I gave you
[23:08:41] <Cork> defk0n: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[23:09:16] <Cork> Erma: i just linked you to how you do that...
[23:09:20] <defk0n> then whats the diffrence bettween load and get :mindblown:
[23:09:22] <gf3> `api get
[23:09:23] <b-ot> gf3: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[23:10:08] <Cork> defk0n: .load loads the data into a target, .get requests the content and you get it in a variable to do what you want with it
[23:10:41] <Cork> defk0n: also notice that var something = $().load(); or var something = $.get() won't ever work
[23:10:51] <Cork> the call is async so you need to use the callbacks
[23:12:24] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Just do it like I showed you: http://jsfiddle.net/6ujgD/
[23:13:48] <Eviltwin> defk0n: Or http://jsfiddle.net/6ujgD/1/
[23:24:19] <defk0n> k thanx eviltwin. it works hehe,

[23:32:54] <Bustacap> Woot woot I'm learning.
[23:33:02] <Bustacap> I came here to ask a question and then figured it out before I asked :)
[23:42:34] <Cork> Bustacap: that is actually the primary purpose of having a place to ask a question
[23:42:50] <FloLeBlanc> hi all
[23:42:57] <Cork> Bustacap: cause just from the task of formulating and preparing the question you have a high chance of figuring it out
[23:44:06] <FloLeBlanc> I'm fetching an element via $(".something").nextSibling and it's a <br> - trying to call .remove() on this element only works in chrome and not in FF/IE/etc. - according to the documentation you just need "a node" however - is there a way to remove that <br> (can't edit the html)
[23:45:29] <Cork> FloLeBlanc: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/kP74T/
[23:45:45] <Cork> FloLeBlanc: could you provide an example of the problem?
[23:46:01] <Bustacap> Cork, that's exactly what happened. I was like ohhhhh duhhhhhhh lol
[23:46:58] <Cork> and that is why one should always try to make a well prepared and formulated question (with a jsfiddle or similar page)
[23:47:06] <Cork> :)
[23:47:11] <Bustacap> :P
[23:47:42] <Cork> but, ya i have gotten the same situation several times my self
[23:48:24] <FloLeBlanc> Cork: trying to build an example thx
[23:51:46] <FloLeBlanc> Cork: interesting - jsfiddle does something totally different allthough it works on all local browsers - perhaps I miss something
[23:52:15] <FloLeBlanc> http://jsfiddle.net/kP74T/7/
[23:52:41] <FloLeBlanc> what it should do is wrap the text after each radio button in a label with a "for" attribute and remove the <br /> at the end
[23:52:54] <Cork> FloLeBlanc: nextSibling isn't a jquery command
[23:53:17] <Cork> ah, you're mixing native js and jquery dom manipulation
[23:53:28] <FloLeBlanc> oh ok rather new to jquery
[23:54:34] <FloLeBlanc> what is the similar jquery command for the next sibling then please?
[23:54:47] <Cork> well input_name is a textnode
[23:54:54] <Cork> so you will still have to use that part
[23:56:13] <Cork> FloLeBlanc: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/kP74T/9/
[23:57:33] <FloLeBlanc> Cork: perfect - thank you very much
[23:57:38] <Cork> np
