[10:12:52] <Es0teric> i have a quick question -- i have an input field, on the first click it triggers a datepicker but i want to clear the value the datepicker sets on the input field after the second click of it
[10:12:55] <Es0teric> how would i do that?
[10:27:33] <taplar> Es0teric do you mean you want to clear the value any time it gets focus?
[10:40:07] <Es0teric> yeah lets go with that
[10:40:35] <taplar> and you're using the jquery ui datepicker, or the bootstrap datepicker?
[10:44:58] <Es0teric> materializecss datepicker
[10:45:16] <Es0teric> taplar https://materializecss.com/pickers.html
[10:45:28] <taplar> gracias
[10:46:05] <taplar> alright, so every time the input gets focus does the datepicker auto open?
[10:46:54] <Es0teric> yeah
[10:47:17] <taplar> Alright, so instead of using a focus binding, the plugin has an "onOpen" option you can give it as a callback.
[10:47:40] <taplar> and there is a a "setDate(newDate)" method
[10:48:05] <taplar> So I would try giving the initialization an onOpen callback, containing a command to set the date to null
[10:48:42] <taplar> or new Date() if you want it to default back to the current day
[10:51:49] <Es0teric> no i want it to be blank
[10:51:59] <taplar> ah, then try the null
[10:52:07] <Es0teric> i want to retain the previous data if the user doesnt click the focus again
[10:52:08] <taplar> or maybe empty string
[10:56:17] <Es0teric> taplar wait what?
[10:57:01] <taplar> ?
[10:57:44] <Es0teric> ok so this would allow me to retain the focus
[10:57:54] <Es0teric> i mean retain the data unless the user goes on focus again/
[10:57:55] <Es0teric> ?
[10:58:19] <taplar> Using the onOpen would allow you to run logic when the datepicker opens, which happens when the input gets focus
[10:59:38] <Es0teric> hmmm
[11:00:44] <Es0teric> wait so if i am on open taplar
[11:01:00] <Es0teric> if i want to reference the data i just use $('#id_of_input').val() ?
[11:01:22] <taplar> No, you want to use the setDate() method of the datepicker
[11:01:40] <taplar> Since you are using the datepicker as the interface to change the value of the input, any change to the actual value should be done through it
[11:01:54] <taplar> Otherwise you risk having your input be a different value than what the datepicker shows as selected
[11:05:34] <Es0teric> taplar so then would it be this.setDate()
[11:05:34] <Es0teric> ?
[11:05:56] <taplar> You could try that.  'this' needs to be the datepicker instance
[11:06:02] <Es0teric> hmmm
[11:06:23] <taplar> look on that page under "Methods"
[11:06:38] <taplar> If you don't have a reference to the instance, there appears to be a method to get it
[11:06:52] <taplar> var instance = M.Datepicker.getInstance(elem);
[11:07:54] <Es0teric> wait but why would i want that to be setDate()?
[11:08:12] <Es0teric> i pretty much want to force the user to select a different date than what is currently in the input field
[11:08:40] <taplar> You said you wanted to clear the value
[11:14:44] <Es0teric> yeah
[11:28:26] <Es0teric> i have this error campaign.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: elem.closest(...).data
[11:28:42] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric what's the rest of the error?
[11:28:55] <Es0teric> Uncaught TypeError: elem.closest(...).data is not a function | line: 51 | funct: elem.closest('.form-group').data | file
[11:28:57] <taplar> From reading the materialize notes, i didn't think it used jquery anymore
[11:29:07] <taplar> so you cannot use jQuery methods
[11:29:25] <Es0teric> i need to check against a data- attribute it has
[11:29:29] <Es0teric> .form-group
[11:29:39] <robertmaxrees> you may need to pass elem to $() first.
[11:29:44] <Es0teric> hmm
[11:29:45] <taplar> so either stick the elem in a jquery object to get the data, or use the dataset property
[11:29:47] <robertmaxrees> $(elemt).closest(...).data('foo')
[11:30:25] <Es0teric> hmmm that works
[11:30:38] <robertmaxrees> that means elem isn't a jquery object.
[13:13:35] <royalty> have any of you ever had experience implementing your own styleswitcher?
[13:13:44] <royalty> i need a more complex one i think than the solutions i found in the wild
[13:13:52] <royalty> was thinking i'd have to do it myself
[13:14:13] <royalty> basically i have 2 stylesheets that make up 1 "theme" and 1 stylesheet that makes up another theme
[13:14:16] <taplar> i don't think i've ever had the need for a style switcher
[13:14:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:14:44] <royalty> yeah, you could make it smart and make it as easy as switching a class but it seems like a pain for me to do that right now
[13:15:00] <taplar> but, conceptually if I were to do something like that, i'd probably drive the classes off of some class on the body
[13:15:03] <royalty> i'd love to switch a class on the body though
[13:15:11] <robertmaxrees> use sass and call it a day.
[13:15:15] <taplar> ^^^
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> super easy to build out your stylesheets at that point.
[13:15:52] <royalty> i'm using scss but my build has a bunch of imports, and there are slight variations in the theme variables
[13:16:05] <royalty> hmmmmm
[13:16:22] <royalty> maybe i should just work to make it a body class switch
[13:16:30] <royalty> maybe it will be worth it
[13:16:36] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> you can do .myClass { @import somesheet.css; }
[13:16:50] <royalty> oh really?
[13:17:08] <royalty> i also have to go through and probably make sure they aren't attaching styles to html/body
[13:17:14] <royalty> because that would prob break on the body
[13:17:22] <royalty> maybe i could just apply the class to the html element instead
[13:17:43] <robertmaxrees> or something like that.  i can't recall.
[13:17:45] <royalty> if i were to do it that way
[13:19:21] <robertmaxrees> oh iirc you need to @import 'somesheet';
[13:20:11] <taplar> looks like https://duckduckgo.com/settings#theme does theirs on the html element
[13:22:03] <royalty> meh it's troublesome because there are styles attached to the html element
[13:22:16] <royalty> maybe if i can figure out the exact variations
[13:22:39] <royalty> then i can only include those in the .htmlelementclass
[13:23:11] <royalty> because the way this was delivered was two separate themes but they share a lot outside of a few scss files
[13:23:34] <robertmaxrees> royalty you can do &.theNewClass to target html.theNewClass, for instance.
[13:24:08] <royalty> yeah but i pretty much don't want to go into the scss files now and figure out every html style and do a find replace
[13:24:10] <taplar> hopefully the two themes have uniform classes within them?
[13:24:43] <royalty> taplar, yeah, for the most part, the variations are this stupid variables.scss file, and some variable differences
[13:24:56] <royalty> can you even "scope" variables? is that a thing? lol
[13:25:01] <taplar> i guess i'm confused then
[13:25:04] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[13:25:08] <taplar> that's what we're talking about
[13:25:15] <robertmaxrees> royalty you'd just need to build out multiple versions of the stylesheets.
[13:25:27] <robertmaxrees> everything you want to do is something sass does very well :)
[13:25:37] <royalty> okay i'll fiddle with this stuff, thanks ;)
[13:25:39] <taplar> .theme1 { ...stuff ...}   .theme2 { ..stuff.. }  both theme1 and theme2 would reference the same sub classes inside, with different values
[13:25:49] <taplar> then all you have to do is swap theme1 with theme2 on whatever parent element
[13:26:54] <taplar> does sass require a precompiler?
[13:27:11] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:27:17] <robertmaxrees> there's just a compiler
[13:27:34] <taplar> but you have to compile it, you can't load it straight into the browser?
[13:27:48] <robertmaxrees> that's the general idea.
[13:27:52] <royalty> yeah
[13:27:54] <royalty> lol
[13:28:02] <taplar> k, I was thinking it was similar to scss like that
[13:28:12] <robertmaxrees> scss and sass are the same thing.
[13:28:17] <robertmaxrees> scss is just a syntac for sass
[13:28:19] <robertmaxrees> *syntax
[13:35:32] <royalty> okay i'll give it a go, and i'll let you guys know how it turned out
[13:35:33] <royalty> woo wooo
[13:35:48] <taplar> is that a good woo wooo?
[13:42:29] <royalty> taplar, i suppose
[13:42:37] <royalty> i haven't gotten it working yet
[13:42:45] <royalty> there are actually a lot of moving parts to this scss wise
[13:43:07] <taplar> no doubt, :)
[13:45:19] <Es0teric> $(instance.doneBtn, '.modal-overlay').on('click', function() { }); should select both those classes correct?
[13:45:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:45:43] <robertmaxrees> that's trying to look for instance.doneBtn inside of .modal-overaly
[13:45:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass a single string to $() instead.
[13:47:20] <Es0teric> but i want both of them to be options
[13:47:29] <Es0teric> like.. if the button is clicked or the overlay is clicked
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> right
[13:47:39] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[13:47:40] <taplar> $(selector, context) is the version you are using
[13:47:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:47:59] <robertmaxrees> you wanbt '.foo, .bar', right now you have '.foo', '.bar'
[13:48:15] <robertmaxrees> *want
[13:48:48] <robertmaxrees> so you need to do $(instance.doneBtn + ' .modal-overlay') to concat the strings together
[13:49:10] <taplar> and possibly add . or # to the front of doneBtn
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> ^ depending on what its value is yeah
[13:50:19] <grapheti> Any typescript questions allowed here?
[13:50:29] <robertmaxrees> would rather not
[13:50:35] <grapheti> kk, ty
[13:50:39] <Es0teric> <button class="btn-flat datepicker-done waves-effect" type="button">Ok</button> <--- thats what instance.doneBtn is
[13:50:55] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric then remove the space and concat without it.
[13:50:58] <robertmaxrees> super basic :)
[13:51:00] <taplar> ##typescript
[13:51:13] <grapheti> usually crickets in there lol
[13:51:14] <taplar> grapheti
[13:51:20] <taplar> ah
[13:51:36] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object HTMLButtonElement].modal-window | line: 2 | funct: Function.ea.error | file:
[13:51:43] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric erm.
[13:51:52] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you have an element object, not a string.
[13:52:15] <robertmaxrees> for that you want $(instance.doneBtn).filter('.modal-overlay')
[13:52:44] <Es0teric> but why though? .modal-overlay is not in the same level as it
[13:52:48] <taplar> or maybe $(.modal-overlay').add(instance.doneBtn)?  Don't really know the desired end result
[13:53:12] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric make a fiddle.
[13:53:14] <robertmaxrees> we can't read your mind.
[13:53:16] <taplar> are you trying to select the doneBtn and all the modal overlay?
[13:53:28] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees, taplar https://kopy.io/WMJIo
[13:53:50] <Es0teric> im trying to make it so that if either doneBtn or modal-overlay is clicked that it still registers the on('click' event
[13:53:52] <robertmaxrees> fiddle.
[13:53:57] <Es0teric> fiddle is blocked here
[13:54:07] <taplar> Then yeah, sounds like you want add
[13:54:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:54:56] <taplar> The main point being, you already have one of the elements you want to do something with.  No need to look it up again
[13:56:04] <Es0teric> so then... $('.modal-overlay').add($(instance.doneBtn)).on('click', function() {});
[13:56:04] <Es0teric> ?
[13:56:12] <robertmaxrees> no need to pass to $() again'
[13:56:16] <taplar> ^^^
[13:56:22] <robertmaxrees> just $('.modal-overlay').add(instance.doneBtn)
[13:56:26] <taplar> add() adds the Element to the result stack
[13:56:58] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/add
[13:57:00] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/add/
[13:57:03] <taplar> lmao
[13:57:32] <Es0teric> nah it still doesnt trigger
[13:58:00] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric do console.log($('.modal-overlay').length)
[13:58:02] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:58:39] <Es0teric> 0
[13:58:46] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[13:59:00] <Es0teric> but after I click the input field that triggers the overlay i get 1
[13:59:09] <robertmaxrees> so again
[13:59:12] <robertmaxrees> what does that tell you?
[13:59:30] <Es0teric> it exists when i click the input field but it doesnt when its not clicked
[13:59:36] <robertmaxrees> boom
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> you should use a delegated handler in this case.
[14:00:09] <Es0teric> so then that means this should be $(elem).closest('.form-group').data('validation') && $('.modal-overlay').length == 1
[14:00:10] <Es0teric> right?
[14:00:17] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:00:19] <Es0teric> delegated handler?
[14:00:28] <taplar> you just need two bindings.  one for the btn and a delegate for the overlay
[14:00:30] <robertmaxrees> you cannot bind to an element thgat doesn't exist
[14:00:40] <Es0teric> righ
[14:00:41] <Es0teric> t
[14:00:43] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:00:53] <robertmaxrees> specifically, https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:00:59] <robertmaxrees> also read http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:01:43] <taplar> i have a different question
[14:01:56] <taplar> Es0teric you're trying to bind when they click the done button or when they click the overlay?
[14:02:06] <Es0teric> taplar both
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> don't bind on click
[14:02:15] <taplar> do both of those actions close the datepicker?
[14:02:19] <Es0teric> yes
[14:02:29] <taplar> that datepicker offers an onClose option
[14:02:37] <taplar> i feel like you're going about it the wrong way
[14:02:44] <Es0teric> onClose does not let me bind to this.open()
[14:02:46] <Es0teric> to keep it open
[14:02:58] <taplar> it doesn't let you call open?
[14:03:02] <Es0teric> nope
[14:03:17] <taplar> even getting the instance like the Methods part showed earlier?
[14:03:34] <Es0teric> yeah
[14:03:41] <taplar> that's werid, :s
[14:03:42] <Es0teric> instance is after getInstance() is called
[14:04:02] <Es0teric> getInstance() is called M.Datepicker.init() so its not available
[14:04:10] <Es0teric> *is called after
[14:04:16] <taplar> wait, wha?
[14:05:35] <Es0teric> getInstance() is called after M.Datepicker.init() so its not available
[14:06:20] <taplar> var instance = M.Datepicker.getInstance(elem)
[14:06:48] <taplar> It would have to be called after the init() otherwise it would not exist
[14:07:20] <Es0teric> exactly
[14:07:21] <Es0teric> which is whats happening
[14:07:26] <Es0teric> so i cant access instance within .init()
[14:07:42] <taplar> no dude...
[14:07:52] <taplar> init would be given a callback for onClose
[14:07:57] <taplar> which inside that, would get the instance
[14:14:30] <taplar> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jjgvVa
[14:14:44] <taplar> which it looks like it only fires if the closes for the "OK", not clicking the overlay
[14:15:01] <taplar> which is werid
[14:15:26] <taplar> lol, i mean, the modal closes, so i'd think it'd need to fire the on close callback.  *shrug*
[14:16:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:18:10] <robertmaxrees> the longer i'm in the newly expanded part of the office, the more I like it.
[14:18:24] <taplar> you got moved?
[14:18:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  we got another chunk of the building our HQ is in
[14:19:07] <taplar> nice.  window cube?  or do you even have cubes any more?
[14:19:17] <robertmaxrees> we actually got cubes hahahaha
[14:19:43] <taplar> i have a fancy corner
[14:19:50] <robertmaxrees> though short walls with what are basically dividers between the desks.  so not true cubicles.
[14:19:56] <robertmaxrees> but we were totally open before.
[14:20:00] <robertmaxrees> no walls at all.
[14:20:26] <taplar> standing desk yet?
[14:20:37] <robertmaxrees> i've had a standing desk sicne I've been here.
[14:20:40] <robertmaxrees> *since
[14:21:30] <taplar> we've started getting adjustable standing desks: https://www.varidesk.com/products/cubicle-standing-desk-cube-corner?o=Size:36%20inch;Color:Black
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> like, at this company I mean :)
[14:21:49] <robertmaxrees> nice.  they have those at another one of our offices.
[14:22:25] <robertmaxrees> the ones here have hand cranks - the entire top of the desk moves.
[14:22:50] <taplar> i may have seen one of those, not sure though
[14:23:03] <taplar> at one point i had monitors on stacks of books, ^_^
[14:23:26] <taplar> and I knew a guy who used to stand with his laptop sitting on one of his desk shelfs
[14:23:29] <robertmaxrees> hah.  I feel like it's basically law that you have to do that at some point in your engineering career.
[14:25:05] <Es0teric> ok so i got it on the onClose
[14:25:13] <Es0teric> but it still doesn't do what i want it to do
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do again?
[14:32:54] <taplar> i think he was trying to prevent the modal from closing if they haven't selected a date yet
[14:35:43] <robertmaxrees> does that framework even offer a way to do that?
[14:35:51] <taplar> i don't see one
[14:36:21] <taplar> like, if he could prevent the clicking of the overlay to close the modal, onClose might work for keeping it open
[14:36:28] <taplar> but I don't see a way to tell it to do that
[14:52:02] <royalty> yeah it's not worth it for me to do the .html-class { @import } technique
[14:52:07] <royalty> there are too many scoping issues to deal with
[14:52:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:52:42] <royalty> adding more specificity to some styles gives preference to them
[14:52:45] <royalty> and it messes up the theme
[14:52:57] <royalty> and it would take a while to figure out all the inconsistencies
[14:53:03] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  okay.
[14:53:42] <royalty> i think instead of style sheet switching though what i'll probably do is just handle the stylesheet loading serverside
[14:53:54] <royalty> so they'll have to refresh the page to see the new stylesheet
[14:54:00] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:54:07] <robertmaxrees> how does that change the problem??
[14:54:20] <royalty> i no longer have to use js to change the stylesheet
[14:54:21] <royalty> lol
[14:54:25] <robertmaxrees> wait what
[14:54:47] <robertmaxrees> how were you trying to change out the stylesheets before?
[14:55:14] <royalty> i wasn't, i was thinking the best way of doing it, and the best way would have been to be able to switch them by changing html class
[14:55:28] <royalty> if i was able to do it that way i could save a cookie and load the cookie and based on that cookie
[14:55:35] <royalty> alter the html class
[14:55:51] <royalty> also alter it on the fly if they toggle it
[14:55:53] <taplar> sessionStorage
[14:55:56] <royalty> yeah
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  something seems strange about the way your CSS is built but OK.
[14:56:12] <royalty> yeah, it's a mess because we bought a theme and it's complicated
[14:56:34] <taplar> so avril lavigne
[14:56:39] <royalty> there are dark and light variations, and i wish the guy who created it made it easier to switch them but basically they need two separate stylesheets to make it easy
[14:57:41] <royalty> so now my options are either use some jquery plugin to stylesheet swap and use the cookie or just handle it serverside as a user setting
[14:58:13] <royalty> i'm leaning towards the user setting option even though it's not as cool as being able to swap styles on the fly
