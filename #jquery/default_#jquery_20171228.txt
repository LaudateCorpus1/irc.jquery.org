[11:37:12] <aruns> Hi, anyone use BXSlider?
[14:21:43] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/ function at line 6...is this function suppose to return true or false?
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[14:28:30] <robertmaxrees> it returns true or false.
[14:32:32] <dimi1947> when I write this function to the console(in my local machine,not in the fiddle) and hit enter...I get udefined and I cannot understand why
[14:32:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:32:52] <robertmaxrees> because there's no $(this)
[14:33:04] <robertmaxrees> well, there is.
[14:33:05] <robertmaxrees> but
[14:33:18] <robertmaxrees> calling it should net an error.
[14:33:20] <robertmaxrees> not undefined.,
[14:34:13] <dimi1947> just a second
[14:35:17] <dimi1947> https://1drv.ms/i/s!AjCBrCpLQye-g3sqUsTzHuRZgk7q
[14:37:11] <robertmaxrees> wow.
[14:37:12] <robertmaxrees> so
[14:37:16] <robertmaxrees> that's just declaring the function.
[14:37:23] <robertmaxrees> that isn't running anything.
[14:37:42] <dimi1947> GOT IT
[14:38:04] <dimi1947> so by hitting enter...I do not execute the function??
[14:38:27] <robertmaxrees> ... no
[14:38:34] <robertmaxrees> that just declares the function
[14:39:46] <dimi1947> can you remind me how I can change line in the console...
[14:39:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:39:57] <dimi1947> go one line below
[14:40:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:40:33] <dimi1947> without hittin enter
[14:40:43] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're asking lol
[14:41:18] <dimi1947> I want to move the cursor in the console in the next line
[14:41:27] <robertmaxrees> press the down arrow?
[14:41:39] <dimi1947> no
[14:42:13] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i have literally no idea what the issue is heh
[14:42:28] <dimi1947> shift+
[14:42:34] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you want to enter a newline into the console?
[14:42:43] <dimi1947> shift+enter....found it in the web
[14:42:55] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you wanted to enter a newline.
[14:43:48] <dimi1947> do you still have that screenshot in front of you?
[14:45:50] <dimi1947> the function is assigned to inputHasValue...correct?
[14:56:14] <robertmaxrees> hey dimi1947 have you gotten a chance to do any basic js tutorials?
[15:06:27] <dimi1947> no
[15:07:03] <dimi1947> I have called the function and this what I get:https://1drv.ms/i/s!AjCBrCpLQye-g3sqUsTzHuRZgk7q
[15:07:06] <robertmaxrees> I'd highly suggest taking the time.  It'll save you a ton of headaches downt he road.
[15:07:19] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you call a function.
[15:07:46] <robertmaxrees> how do you normally see functions used?
[15:08:04] <dimi1947> what do you mean when say used?
[15:08:31] <robertmaxrees> like, when somebody calls a function, what does that look like
[15:08:31] <robertmaxrees> "?
[15:08:56] <dimi1947> you call the function by it's name...
[15:09:00] <robertmaxrees> and...
[15:09:41] <dimi1947> and with arguments...if any..what else?
[15:09:51] <robertmaxrees> how would you pass the arguments?
[15:10:28] <dimi1947> in the parantheses...I KNOW THESE things...I am not so novice
[15:10:53] <robertmaxrees> so then look back at your code.
[15:10:55] <robertmaxrees> what is it missing?
[15:11:50] <duch_kazatel> that was weirdf
[15:11:57] <dimi1947> hmmm...I ommited the argument...
[15:12:06] <robertmaxrees> the parens are not optional.
[15:12:18] <robertmaxrees> they're what tells the engine that you want to run the function.
[15:12:35] <robertmaxrees> otherwise the engine just thinks you're referring to the function object itself.
[15:12:38] <dimi1947> now..the f....r works
[15:14:10] <dimi1947> there is something I do not understand though...
[15:14:17] <robertmaxrees> yes?
[15:15:04] <dimi1947> the function has as an argument an index...a number...what this numnber represents?
[15:15:18] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) it's not being used.
[15:15:35] <robertmaxrees> probably a leftover from when I rewrote it.
[15:17:45] <dimi1947> the function returns a value if I supply as an argument a number...any number,cannot understand the mechanismn behind it,what it serves
[15:18:06] <robertmaxrees> i just said it's not being used.
[15:18:09] <robertmaxrees> you can delete it.
[15:18:12] <dimi1947> Ok
[15:18:25] <robertmaxrees> dunno how that wasn't clear heh
[15:18:53] <dimi1947> I cannot believe I had forgotten how to make a function call
[15:20:56] <robertmaxrees> wtf why does my connection keep dropping.
[15:22:22] <pavonia> "Disconnected by services"
[15:22:43] <robertmaxrees> my whole machine is dropping from time to time.
[15:22:44] <robertmaxrees> super weird.
[15:57:41] <Neo2> hi
[15:58:03] <Neo2> I thinking about the best environment for web development. What is it?
[15:58:41] <robertmaxrees> could you be a little more specific?
[16:02:47] <robertmaxrees> Neo2
[16:04:52] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:17:38] <bjsnider> i've got a little php function that grabs a db count and then returns it for display in a badge. i'm wondering if it's worth switching that to ajax
[16:18:16] <robertmaxrees> you'd still need php bjsnider
[16:19:05] <bjsnider> unless the client has updated the db itself, there's no way to tell when the ajax request/response need sot be run, right? i'd have to do something like running it in a cron or whatever
[16:19:56] <robertmaxrees> there are ways to do a server-based push.  some people also use recursive timeouts for that kind of stuff.
[16:21:08] <bjsnider> somehow twitter knows you've posted a tweet and pushes out a notification to the client
[16:21:53] <bjsnider> i'd have to know server-side that the db has been updated in a very specific way, ie. a way that would change the count, and then push the php function again
[16:22:16] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: I mean OS, what OS do you use?
[16:22:21] <bjsnider> i'd google this, but i have no idea what to search for
[16:22:28] <Neo2> linux or windows?
[16:23:07] <Neo2> in internet many articles about linux is betterr for web development...
[16:23:52] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 i use windows.
[16:23:56] <robertmaxrees> lots of people use osx.
[16:24:07] <robertmaxrees> it's all about what you're most comfortable with.
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider the particular technique depends on a variety of factors.
[16:25:20] <Neo2> robertmaxrees: for node.js probably better linux, for to be closer to server environment...
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> Neo2 generally doesn't matter.  and with docker, it definitely doesn't matter.
[16:26:48] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider you could look into a job queue/message brokerage/etc kind of system for that - https://www.rabbitmq.com/
[16:26:59] <robertmaxrees> that's one example.  there are tons of other options.
[16:29:57] <bjsnider> i would publish one of these messages along with a successful change of the db
[16:30:06] <robertmaxrees> that'd be one way, yeah.
[16:31:55] <bjsnider> that gives me another idea. what if i run a json version of the php that returns the count if there's a successful change?
[16:32:11] <bjsnider> all the ajax needs is a json response right?
[16:32:36] <robertmaxrees> it can be any parseable response.
[16:32:49] <robertmaxrees> json is the most common, but you could just shoot back the straight number, html, etc.
[16:33:53] <bjsnider> i was thinking of returning all 4 counts as an associative php array, which would translate well into a json object
[16:34:19] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you actually do the conversion on the php side and you're g2g
[16:34:26] <robertmaxrees> just use the built-in JSON converter.
[16:34:29] <bjsnider> yeah, clearly
[17:20:47] <bjsnider> just looking at the mdn article on sse, that sounds like it might be the ticket
[17:21:40] <robertmaxrees> what kind of browsers do you need to support?
[17:23:11] <bjsnider> really, the whole feature is a luxury rather than a necessity, so if the ms browsers are excluded, so be it
[17:23:22] <robertmaxrees> eh
[17:23:25] <Lucenut> I have a colorbox dialog opening and a link inside of it that is supposed to direct the dialog to another cfm. But I am getting a tiny little blank dialog.
[17:23:38] <bjsnider> obviously most of the people using ms browsers are >150 years old
[17:23:39] <robertmaxrees> bjoe2k4 i'd consider using websockets instead.
[17:23:49] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider heh not true at all.
[17:24:06] <Lucenut> In the FF console I see a successful GET for the page it is supposed to be going to, but the dialog is shrinking to 0 width and 20px wide.
[17:24:24] <robertmaxrees> Lucenut no way to know without seeing a test case.
[17:24:56] <robertmaxrees> Lucenut or at least the related js.
[17:27:00] <Lucenut> Something is resizing the colorbox dialog. This same codebase works in many other instances.
[17:27:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.  i have no idea how to help since i can't see any of the code.
[17:27:27] <robertmaxrees> like... i wouldn't know what to suggest.
[17:32:18] <bjsnider> i've seen a lot of pages arguing the http/2 sse vs. websockets case
[17:33:11] <robertmaxrees> that's strange.
[17:33:18] <robertmaxrees> they're not really competing technologies.
[17:33:29] <bjsnider> this is a small case, not a huge gaming server with hundress of thousands of users
[17:34:09] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) it's a Good Citizenâ„¢ thing to do to support browsers.
[17:34:13] <robertmaxrees> but whatever floats your boat.
[17:35:18] <bjsnider> https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-deep-dive-into-websockets-and-http-2-with-sse-how-to-pick-the-right-path-584e6b8e3bf7
[17:35:20] <robertmaxrees> ah you can polyfill sses.
[17:35:25] <robertmaxrees> *sse
[17:35:58] <robertmaxrees> that's more of a comparison of when to use one or the other.
[18:11:33] <Lucenut> OK, upon further review my colorbox dialog initially has 2 divs cboxContent and cboxLoadedContent. But then when you click on a link on that page it is supposed to go to another page like this:  function editWin(pid,fid,parid,optv){           var url = "docs/divs/div_udPages.cfm?page_id=" + pid + "&field_id="+ fid + "&parent_id=" + parid + "&option_value=" + optv;           //alert(url); return false;           $.fn.colorbox({ href:u
[18:13:09] <robertmaxrees> that get cut off?
[18:13:14] <Lucenut> The colorbox dialog is tiny and doesn't seem to contain those 2 divs, just cboxOverlay, colorbox and cboxWrapper divs
[18:13:30] <Lucenut> No, that is the function the links call.
[18:13:34] <robertmaxrees> any way you could paste taht code into a fiddle or something?
[18:13:54] <robertmaxrees> because it stops at $.fn.colorbox({ href:u for me
[18:13:56] <Lucenut> And when I dump the url in an alert it looks fine.
[18:14:10] <Lucenut> If I paste it into a new browser tab it renders fine.
[18:14:52] <Lucenut> https://pastebin.com/SmnyutSA
[18:15:31] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're doing $.fn.colorbox()?  don't see it getting used that way anywhere in the docs.
[18:15:45] <robertmaxrees> like what if you just did $.colorbox() ?
[18:16:04] <Lucenut> Dunno. This same codebase is used in dozens of our applications and works just fine.
[18:16:18] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out things I'd try.
[18:16:18] <Lucenut> I just checked 2 of them and compared this code.
[18:16:43] <Lucenut> (2 applications where this function works)
[18:16:48] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:16:56] <robertmaxrees> just suggesting something to try, yo.
[18:17:29] <Lucenut> Yeah, I didn't write the code and don't really understand it.
[18:17:42] <robertmaxrees> so why not try that small tweak?
[18:17:44] <Lucenut> Just trying to figure out why it's not working in this application.
[18:17:46] <robertmaxrees> see if that fiuxed it?
[18:17:49] <robertmaxrees> *fixes
[18:18:03] <Lucenut> OK
[18:19:02] <Lucenut> Nope, I changed it to $.colorbox({ href:url });  and same thing happens.
[18:19:27] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea then.
[18:20:36] <Lucenut> I just don't really understand the mechanics involved. Usually when I have something js/jquery going wrong it's because the jquery or colorbox js isn't running.
[18:20:53] <robertmaxrees> so how can we help? :)
[18:21:13] <Lucenut> But it sure appears like it is here. We are IN the colorbox. The link  has a good url and the js is firing.
[18:21:40] <robertmaxrees> maybe you've got some CSS or JS conflicting
[18:22:12] <Lucenut> I just thought maybe someone would know why the cboxWrapper is there but not the cboxContent.
[18:24:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, dunno.  without seeing more context it's kind of a crapshoot.
[18:43:40] <SideFX> Is there some way I can find out where the code from Datepicker is coming from in my browser?
[18:44:38] <robertmaxrees> like what file?
[18:47:45] <robertmaxrees> SideFX ^
[18:48:14] <SideFX> Yeah
[18:48:58] <robertmaxrees> you could look to see where datepicker gets defined by doing a "find in files" and looking for a string like 'datepicker =' or something.
[18:49:44] <SideFX> Where is find in files?
[18:50:20] <robertmaxrees> in chrome it's under "sources" in the dev tools
[18:50:20] <SideFX> I'm using Firefox BTW
[18:50:31] <robertmaxrees> in FF it's under the debugger tab.
[18:53:12] <SideFX> Mmm that gives me like 300 results
[18:53:36] <robertmaxrees> maybe there's a file named "datepicker.js" or something like that?
[18:55:46] <SideFX> This site is a mess, I don't think there's an easy way to figure it out
[18:55:58] <robertmaxrees> is it public?
[18:56:01] <robertmaxrees> can you share it to the channel?
[18:57:48] <SideFX> No it's private for now
[18:59:22] <robertmaxrees> hum.
[18:59:38] <robertmaxrees> why are you looking for the file in the first place?
[19:17:41] <SideFX> robertmaxrees I'm trying to make the selector only have a place to choose the date and not the time
[19:18:15] <robertmaxrees> so you don't wanna know where datepicker is defined, you want to know where it's getting initialized.
[19:18:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd search for something like ').datepicker({' and see if that changes anything.
