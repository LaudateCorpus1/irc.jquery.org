[00:00:10] <yellowfish> what kind of system requirements?
[00:00:12] <Cork> iaj: no
[00:00:23] <Cork> system information isn't available in js
[00:00:37] <iaj> Cork: ok thanks :)
[00:00:52] <Cork> the closest you can get is check for hw acceleration though webgl
[00:01:04] <Cork> but it is just a matter of time before they implement it in software
[00:01:34] <iaj> Do you happen to know a snow effect that's not so heavy on the system :)?
[00:01:39] <iaj> Because mine is... obviously.. haha
[00:01:47] <Cork> what are you doing?
[00:02:03] <Cork> css3 is often a good choice if you don't want to tax the system
[00:07:43] <pixelpimp> Try something like modernizr or yepnope; they'll let you detect if CSS transitions and animations are available, then you can alter your output to suit.
[00:08:07] <pixelpimp> Use jQuery when they're not available, use CSS when they are.  The CSS transitions will always be much faster.
[00:13:50] <iaj> Cork: well to avoid long talk, (please ignore that dumb content :P) I have that site runnign on TYPO3, http://www.marcgalal.com/weihnachtsgeschenk   problem is that the flash video is lagging because of the snow
[00:13:56] <iaj> pixelpimp: I will look into it thanks
[00:14:54] <Cork> iaj: the snow causes full page reflow
[00:15:00] <Cork> so ya, that will be expensive
[00:15:08] <Cork> not really a way around that
[00:15:39] <Cork> you could try moving the snowflakes with css3 transform
[00:15:50] <Cork> it at least would remove some of the work for the browser
[00:16:18] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/eVRLd/6/   what am i missing this time...
[00:16:43] <iaj> Cork: Alright, I'm gonna try it I think, do you have an example for the CSS3 transform?
[00:17:03] <Cork> ?mdn transform
[00:17:05] <b-ot> Cork: transform - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[00:17:52] <iaj> thanks
[00:19:00] <pixelpimp> vinex08: you tell us?
[00:19:23] <pixelpimp> vinex08: It's adding your class when it comes into view, if that's what you're attempting to do.
[00:22:06] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:23:15] <vinex08> pixelpimp: yes.. that's what im trying to do
[00:23:45] <pixelpimp> Congratulations!  it's working.
[00:26:55] <vinex08> yes it is! :) i guess now my question is.. why it didnt overwrite the css?
[00:28:09] <pixelpimp> Well, that'd be a #css question
[00:28:43] <vinex08> positions!! arrghh
[00:29:03] <vinex08> i guess i should eat first..
[00:35:57] <aro> how do you trigger a tab on jqueryui
[00:36:43] <aro> nvm
[00:36:45] <aro> i got it :)

[01:07:52] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/eVRLd/10/ my fadeIn doesnt work?
[01:08:33] <Cork> works here
[01:08:48] <funhouse> is it possible to figure out the id off the droppable that the draggable is leaving from?
[01:09:23] <abishek> why does jquery slideToggle work if a particular element is set with the twitter bootstrap helper class 'hide'?
[01:09:40] <abishek> why does jquery slideToggle not work if a particular element is set with the twitter bootstrap helper class 'hide'?
[01:09:47] <Cork> abishek: prob cause of something like !important
[01:10:23] <abishek> Cork, thnx. Let me check
[01:11:33] <Cork> vinex08: you might get a conflict with the transition though
[01:11:37] <abishek> Cork, does slideToggle not set the !important when setting the class?
[01:12:00] <Cork> abishek: it depends on the inline style tag
[01:12:04] <Cork> *attribute
[01:12:08] <Cork> so no it doens't
[01:19:49] <abishek> Cork, can you tell me how to fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/EqwkQ/93/
[01:21:14] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm using masonry jquery plugin. Does anyone know a way how I can have the masonry bricks always take the full width? No space left and right
[01:21:48] <vinex08> Cork: it does?
[01:22:17] <vinex08> to me it just slidesup
[01:23:17] <Cork> abishek: you can't use slideToggle with that class
[01:23:56] <Cork> abishek: http://jsfiddle.net/EqwkQ/94/
[01:24:32] <abishek> Cork, thnx
[01:24:32] <Cork> vinex08: well it does to and from
[01:24:49] <Cork> that is why i suspect it might be a conflict with the css3 transform
[01:24:56] <Cork> (and transition)
[01:27:58] <M3kH> Good Morning!
[01:28:30] <tyteen4a03> hey, does anybody know of a dropdown menu package that does not attempt to style the dropdown menu (i.e it slideDown() and slideUp() the appropriate <div>, and that's it)
[01:29:10] <Cork> tyteen4a03: the styling should just be a css file
[01:29:18] <Cork> just ignore it and it should work just fine
[01:30:37] <vinex08> hmmmm.. Cork can you update it? Pleeaseeee?? I already spent hours trying to achive that effect. Fadein and Slideup at the same time :)
[01:31:08] <tyteen4a03> Cork, are you aware of any dropdown menus that accepts <ol/ul> instead of <select>?
[01:31:09] <Cork> vinex08: if you want both you can't use the separate functions
[01:31:25] <Cork> vinex08: use the animate command of the css3 transition
[01:31:43] <Cork> ?g jquery menu
[01:31:45] <b-ot> Cork: Menu | jQuery UI → http://jqueryui.com/menu/
[01:32:28] <Cork> tyteen4a03: but what your looking for sounds so simple that you most likely don't need a plugin
[01:40:57] <litleCat42> Hey guys, how are you ? Got an issue with twitter-typeahead, it add a span class="tt-hint" every time I used an input field (radio input too ...) so my css and other feature are totaly broken. Any idea on the way to solve it ?

[01:45:16] <Yatekii> Hey guys, what am I doing wrong with the variable setup n l3? https://gist.github.com/Yatekii/6e6c8c77ae5f61db2a13
[01:48:11] <Cork> Yatekii: are you sure keyboard(setup) returns a function?
[01:48:32] <Cork> also your defining setup after you use it
[01:48:34] <Yatekii> ya it worked when I had the content of setup directly in the brackets
[01:48:41] <Yatekii> ah that might be the problem
[01:48:43] <Yatekii> I'm dumb
[01:49:07] <Cork> Yatekii: cause $(document).ready() expect a function
[01:49:21] <Cork> and $('#sale_name').keyboard(setup) most likely returns a jquery object
[01:49:27] <Yatekii> kk ty
[01:49:39] <Cork> $(document).ready(function() { $('#sale_name').keyboard(setup) }); is prob what you want
[01:49:53] <Yatekii> solved it!
[01:49:56] <Yatekii> tks a lot!
[01:50:02] <Yatekii> ya
[01:50:07] <Yatekii> wasn't sure if I had to do it
[01:50:11] <Yatekii> put it now
[01:52:46] <Yatekii> yay, netsplit
[02:03:07] <Cadmi> Hello
[02:03:36] <Cadmi> I am executing an script that tries, using ajax, to load a certain part of the page. I am subscribed to the event of the load method of jquery but it is never called. Anyidea please?
[02:03:39] <Cadmi> this is the code: http://pastebin.com/sCjxS3Yr
[02:04:20] <Cork> Cadmi: is the url on the same domain?
[02:13:00] <Cadmi> Cork yes
[02:13:08] <Cadmi> i only reload the content
[02:13:28] <Cork> donno what goes on then, should work just fine
[02:13:34] <Cork> do you have a live example?
[02:13:56] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm using masonry jquery plugin. Does anyone know a way how I can have the masonry bricks always take the full width? No space left and right
[02:14:53] <Cork> sunbeam: check what the css does on the elements
[02:15:37] <sunbeam> Cork: nothing yet
[02:16:30] <DarsVaeda> anyone know of a working searchable dropdown plugin?
[02:18:05] <Cork> autocomplete?
[02:18:14] <Cork> ?g jquery autocomplete
[02:18:17] <b-ot> Cork: Autocomplete | jQuery UI → http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[02:18:56] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[02:20:40] <sunbeam> Cork: any idea what I can do ?
[02:21:18] <Cork> sunbeam: well apart from checking what adds the margin, no
[02:21:24] <Cork> i don't
[02:24:00] <sunbeam> there is no margin or padding
[02:24:10] <sunbeam> i just need the bricks to take the full width
[02:24:15] <sunbeam> of the window
[02:28:05] <Cork> check the width of the elements then
[02:28:57] <sunbeam> it should be a percentage, thats the only way right?
[02:29:20] <Cork> depends on the layout
[02:29:29] <Cork> but ya percentage is prob what you want
[02:29:33] <sunbeam> Cork: layout is full width
[02:29:46] <sunbeam> Cork: but i think percentages cannot really work with masonry
[02:29:51] <Cork> i have no clue what you layout looks like; that is what i meant
[02:30:01] <sunbeam> because the percentages have to be different on several widths
[02:30:10] <sunbeam> like 30 different percentages
[02:32:54] <shomon> hi, how do you get a map going with OSM layers, and import a kml file? and where is a good place to ask?
[02:33:21] <Cork> shomon: are you sure you asked in the correct channel?
[02:33:57] <Cork> cause that doesn't sounds the least bit jquery related
[02:35:05] <shomon> well if there's a jquery library for it...
[02:38:48] <Mafiay2k> morning
[02:38:57] <Mafiay2k> is there any freelancers here?
[02:39:48] <Cadmi> Cork of course, sorry for the delay
[02:40:05] <doev> hi. I don't know, if it is a javascript or jquery problem. Is it possible to work with array definitions that use valid json-code?
[02:40:08] <Cadmi> sorry for the bg video
[02:40:14] <Cadmi> when you press to Productos
[02:40:22] <Cadmi> the page loads
[02:40:23] <doev> for example:
[02:40:30] <Cadmi> but the load event is not being called :(
[02:40:34] <Cadmi> the script is named ajax.js
[02:41:06] <doev> [{field:'listprice',type:'numberbox',options:{precision:1},op:['equal','notequal','less','greater']}] is required, but json has quoted keys.
[02:41:42] <Cork> doev: that is an array with one object in it
[02:41:48] <Cork> [0].field
[02:41:50] <ochsen_hoffmann> yo Cadmi :P here aswell
[02:41:51] <Cork> [0].type
[02:41:52] <Cork> and so on
[02:44:49] <doev> Cork, php generates tzhis for me: [{"field":'listprice',"type":'numberbox',"options":{precision:1},"op":['equal','notequal','less','greater']}]
[02:44:59] <doev> yes, there is only one element in the example
[02:45:09] <Cork> doev: ya, that is the same thing
[02:45:12] <Mafiay2k> nice : http://christmasexperiments.com/2013/03/
[02:45:19] <doev> I think I need a function that generates a array from json-code
[02:45:21] <Cadmi> sorry i wait
[02:45:27] <Cork> except that includes some invalid parts for json
[02:45:39] <Cork> ['equal','notequal','less','greater'] <-- this isn't valid json
[02:45:48] <doev> Cork, javascript shout work with quoted keys too?
[02:45:54] <Cork> yes
[02:46:18] <Cork> doev: json requires quoted strings
[02:46:23] <Cork> *keys
[02:46:37] <Cork> doev: and it requires that strings is quoted with "
[02:46:50] <doev> Cork, biz js need ' quotes?
[02:46:54] <Cork> no
[02:47:00] <Cork> js accepts both
[02:47:08] <Cork> json is stricter then js
[02:53:57] <Cadmi> ochsen_hoffmann haha hi
[02:54:49] <Cadmi> Cork i sent you the link of my webpage
[02:54:52] <Cadmi> it is so strange
[02:55:00] <Cork> you did?
[02:55:02] <Cork> where?
[02:55:10] <Cork> you mean pm?
[02:55:11] <Cadmi> test.bittenbit.es
[02:56:39] <Cadmi> if you click for example "productos"
[02:56:44] <Cadmi> the content is loaded as you can see
[02:57:03] <Cadmi> but misteriously the event of the load method of the script is not called when the ajax completes
[02:57:06] <Cadmi> this is the code
[02:57:11] <Cadmi> http://pastebin.com/sCjxS3Yr
[02:58:12] <Cork> Cadmi: the click triggers errors in $('#metaslider_107').data('nivoslider').stop; file: slide_starter.js
[02:58:15] <Cork> so js crashes
[02:58:20] <doev> test = $.parseJSON([{"field":"id","type":"text","options":[],"op":["contains"]}]); <- [11:57:34.472] SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character ? Why that? The json-string is generated by php and definitiv valid.
[02:58:33] <Cork> doev: that isn't json
[02:58:43] <Cork> '[{"field":"id","type":"text","options":[],"op":["contains"]}]' is json
[02:58:44] <Cadmi> Cork when an script provocates an error, the js process stops?
[02:58:51] <Cork> yes
[02:58:57] <Cork> well not process
[02:59:05] <Cork> but the parser stops
[02:59:13] <Cadmi> ochsen_hoffmann do you like my menu ? haha
[02:59:16] <Cadmi> ok
[02:59:19] <Cadmi> let me correct the problem
[02:59:23] <Cadmi> i think it will continue
[02:59:35] <ochsen_hoffmann> yea i love it
[02:59:36] <ochsen_hoffmann> ^^
[02:59:50] <Cork> doev: json is ALWAYS a string
[03:00:10] <Cork> doev: if you write [] and {} directoy in javascript is is already an array and object, no need to parse it
[03:00:16] <doev> Cork, yes, forget the quoites ;)
[03:00:45] <ochsen_hoffmann> Cadmi: used my jquery nav link? :P
[03:01:12] <Cadmi> of course
[03:01:21] <Cadmi> :P
[03:02:46] <Cadmi> Cork I can't believe
[03:02:49] <Cadmi> it is working now
[03:02:50] <Cadmi> incredible
[03:03:20] <Cork> Cadmi: believe what?
[03:03:25] <Mafiay2k> is anyone able to do thinks like this? http://christmasexperiments.com/2013/03/
[03:03:46] <Cork> Cadmi: the code throws an exception, of course the code won't continue
[03:03:47] <Cadmi> Cork i didn't know that a problem in other script can reflect in the event listener of other
[03:03:55] <Cadmi> but it is another script
[03:03:59] <Cork> Cadmi: there isn't separate scripts
[03:04:10] <Cork> js doesn't have that separation concept
[03:04:17] <Cork> it is all one big pool
[03:04:35] <Cork> name separation exists in the form of scops but that's it
[03:04:51] <Cadmi> yah yah it has sense
[03:05:05] <Cadmi> thank you so much
[03:05:13] <Cadmi> i am going to try to solve the real problem within that event ;)
[03:06:18] <doev> Cork, thx it is working now.
[04:03:46] <Cadmi> one question please
[04:04:29] <Cork> is red blue?
[04:04:33] <Cork> :)
[04:04:40] <Cadmi> i am making an ajax reload of certain part of the page when clicking a menu item. As i read in google, the click event propagation has to be stopped to avoid the browser continue loading the page, unfortunately if i do that i loss the click event in the other scripts i have
[04:04:47] <Cadmi> is this a normal practise ?
[04:04:51] <Cadmi> haha
[04:05:02] <Cadmi> depending the light you are using to see the colour
[04:05:02] <Cadmi> :P
[04:05:28] <Cadmi> maybe i can make them to execute before
[04:05:28] <Cork> Cadmi: propagation isn't needed to be stopped
[04:05:32] <Cork> only preventDefault()
[04:05:39] <fabioportieri> var red = 'blue';
[04:05:44] <pixelpimp> Just went to the jQuery facebook page.  Under "related pages," the first result was "Commodore 64."
[04:05:53] <Cadmi> Cork mmm
[04:05:59] <Cadmi> let me check this method please
[04:06:18] <Cork> pixelpimp: heh
[04:06:29] <Cork> the developers like to play a lot of old games? :D
[04:07:04] * fabioportieri currently plays speedball 2 brutal deluxe
[04:08:11] <Yatekii> Guys what does this exactly mean: TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'c.ui.position') ?
[04:08:30] <Yatekii> failing here: https://gist.github.com/Yatekii/2b2f765ebb98eb09c28f
[04:08:48] <fabioportieri> it means c.ui is undefined
[04:08:49] <Cork> Yatekii: that you ex. are trying to load jquery ui before jquery
[04:08:50] <pixelpimp> Something is undefined and you're treating it as an object
[04:09:08] <Cork> or ya a plugin that depends on ui without ui loaded
[04:09:18] <Yatekii> um but I use that code on ready hmm
[04:09:25] <Yatekii> does the order of includes matter maybe?
[04:09:27] <Yatekii> might be
[04:09:47] <fabioportieri> yes it matters
[04:10:06] <pixelpimp> Very much so.
[04:16:26] <Yatekii> ok I did not even include ui js
[04:17:26] <Yatekii> but now I am getting this: http://grab.by/sSwW didn't get that error before I included jquery-ui line that triggers it: $(document).ready(function(){$('#sale_name').keyboard(setup)});
[04:17:32] <Cadmi> Cork "If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered." this implies that other js won't receive the click, isnt it ?
[04:17:53] <Cork> no
[04:18:13] <Cork> "default" in this case is the browser default action
[04:18:36] <Cadmi> ahm
[04:19:19] <Cadmi> I have a page with an slider in a menu option
[04:19:29] <Cadmi> if i comment prevent default the slider loads
[04:19:39] <Cadmi> but ajax does not work (all the page reloads)
[04:19:52] <Cadmi> if i discomment the preventdefault the slider does not load
[04:19:54] <Cadmi> but the ajax works
[04:20:04] <Cadmi> i think the slider is waiting for "ready" on the document or init
[04:20:06] <Cadmi> or something similar
[04:20:09] <Cadmi> it is nivo-slider
[04:20:30] <Cadmi> i think i have to start the nivo-slider again manually
[04:20:42] <Yatekii> Cork you know any help? :S
[04:22:23] <Cork> Yatekii: looks like your missing a lot of $.keyboard.layout values
[04:22:50] <Cork> or possible the entirety of  $.keyboard
[04:24:10] <Yatekii> Cork yeah but it is just telling it is missing since I added jquery-ui.js oO
[04:24:41] <Cork> prob cause it never got this far before
[04:25:11] <Yatekii> ok works
[04:25:23] <Yatekii> seems like I had jquery included twice
[04:25:25] <Yatekii> so yeah
[04:25:34] <Yatekii> dunno what went wrong but seems to work now
[04:29:03] <Mottie> is http://bugs.jquery.com/ down for anyone else?
[04:29:24] <Cork> ?down http://bugs.jquery.com/
[04:29:25] <b-ot> Cork: It's not just you! http://bugs.jquery.com/ is down! (502 Bad Gateway)
[04:30:40] <Cork> bugs was buggy last week too
[04:30:50] <Cork> they're prob trying to fix it
[04:31:11] <Cadmi> Cork i don't get it :( The nivo slider plugin I downloaded works when no ajax enabled. I think that nivos-slider is shown when the ready event occurs in the document. Is there any way to simulate that event when i reload the content of certain page using ajax? I shouldn't modify the plugin because it is not mine
[04:31:50] <Cork> Cadmi: the plugin should have a way to call it directly
[04:31:56] <Cork> if it doesn't then... not really
[04:32:39] <Cork> those slideshows is sadly among the worst coded plugins you can find for jquery
[04:32:53] <Cadmi> mm
[04:33:02] <Cork> and i don't mean nivo specifically
[04:33:07] <Cork> i mean all slideshow plugins
[04:33:07] <Cadmi> :( ok look for this methods
[04:33:42] <Cork> haven't seen one that doesn't break a long list of structure rules
[04:33:47] <Cork> and assumes a lot of wrong things
[04:34:43] <Cadmi> i understand
[04:34:53] <Cadmi> but i can't implement my own slider haha
[04:34:59] <Cadmi> or maybe yes..
[04:34:59] <Cadmi> mm
[04:44:43] <Armistice> Let's say I have a tr which I want to perform a click event on... but I have a couple of anchors inside. How would I perform the click on everything except the anchors?
[04:45:53] <Armistice> or children of anchors...
[04:46:00] <Armistice> seeing as one has an img tag inside.
[04:47:07] <Cork> Armistice: so you want to catch clicks on the tr except if it started on the link?
[04:47:18] <Armistice> That sounds accurate, yes.
[04:47:54] <Cork> $('table').on('click', 'tr', function(event) { if($(event.target).is('a')) { return; } /* your action here */ })
[04:50:42] <Armistice> I was actually close to that. :) So how come this works if a child of the anchor was clicked? For instance: <a ...><img src="this element" /></a>
[04:50:52] <Armistice> Surely if you click it you'd be clicking the img tag?
[04:51:34] <Cork> it should, but it might be a special things with img and a tags
[04:51:54] <Cork> i have a vague memory there is something in the spec for that
[04:52:47] <Cork> Armistice: alternatively you can do something like $(this).find('a, a *').is(event.target)
[04:55:19] <pixelpimp> The click is on the <a>, even if the element you're on is the <img> inside
[04:56:44] <Cork> right click always fires at a tags
[04:56:54] <Cork> that's why you can't nest them
[04:57:34] <Armistice> ah yes.
[04:57:51] <Armistice> thanks :)

[05:23:49] <Cork> Sakyl: please include the error message
[05:24:46] <Cork> Sakyl: i would expect you to get error cause data, contacts, party and details is undefined
[05:24:55] <Cork> but not semicolon
[05:25:35] <Sakyl> Here you go: http://pastebin.com/5Et9Jaw1
[05:25:51] <Cork> ah
[05:25:52] <Cork> right
[05:26:04] <Cork> you can't decalre a variable with the name dataArray[partyID]
[05:26:14] <Cork> would be the variable dataArray
[05:26:41] <Cork> * dataArray would be the variable
[05:27:24] <Sakyl> So. How should I declare it then?
[05:27:54] <Cork> also you know that dataArray[partyID] would create 1816 elements in that array?
[05:28:05] <Cork> is that really what you want?
[05:28:23] <Cork> arrays always start at 0
[05:30:28] <Cork> Sakyl: i suspect what you want is something like this http://pastebin.com/fCpfKUyc
[05:31:10] <Sakyl> Ok. Thanks for the Help. I was stuck with the thought of an array
[05:31:12] <Sakyl> ty!
[06:05:45] <jnardiello> hi all
[06:43:32] <onenine90> Has anyone else experienced this issue with Panic's Transmit FTP client? Often when I try to save using CMD+S, it doesn't actually save. Not until I click the Transmit icon in my OS X Dock, and when the client window regains focus, it saves then..
[06:43:53] <abailarri> Hello. I' m trying to make a fadeout and remove a div on succes ajax fuction, but not works. Any help please? http://jsfiddle.net/b8QyU/12/
[06:48:28] <Cork> abailarri: why don't you just do $(this).closest('tr') instead of the data magic?
[06:49:34] <Cork> abailarri: and the reason it fails is cause $(fila2) doesn't match anything
[06:49:48] <Cork> $('tr-<number>')
[06:49:53] <Cork> should be $('#tr-<number>')
[06:52:21] <BillCriswell> Cork: Learned something interesting the other day thought you might like it: $('input').prop('form'); returns the form element the input is associated with.
[06:52:38] <BillCriswell> If you don't already know, at least.
[06:52:48] <sunbeam> Does anyone know a way how I can use masonry and always have the images fit the full width?
[06:52:52] <Cork> BillCriswell: haven't though about it, but ya it's logical
[06:53:08] <Cork> as each input field has a reference to the form on the element
[06:53:12] <Cork> (elm.form)
[06:53:25] <Cork> BillCriswell: thx for sharing
[06:54:39] <BillCriswell> Cork: Haha no problem.
[06:55:03] <BillCriswell> I just always did .closest('form'). Came across it randomly on StackOverflow.
[06:55:17] <Cork> ya i usually do too
[06:55:54] <Cork> though i got hit by a ton of bricks a few years back when i half way through implementing a form system remembered that you can't nest forms
[06:56:23] <Cork> was a bit annoying having to go back to the graphicer and saying "you need to redesign this" XD
[06:56:40] <Cork> "it's not technically possible to do this"
[06:57:00] <BillCriswell> Yeah it's never fun saying that.
[06:57:17] <BillCriswell> I never liked that I couldn't wrap a tr with a form.
[06:57:29] <Cork> well on the sketch review i had totally forgot that you couldn't
[06:57:39] <Cork> well it is logical
[06:57:55] <Cork> cause it would mean you want to send the data to two places
[06:58:04] <abailarri_> Hello. I' m trying to make a fadeout and remove a div on succes ajax fuction, but not works. Any help please? http://jsfiddle.net/b8QyU/12/
[06:58:07] <BillCriswell> Indeed.
[06:58:38] <Cork> BillCriswell: and now in html5 you have the form attribute so you can bind the element to what ever form you like
[06:58:49] <Cork> ugg.. i used the marketing word >_<
[06:59:17] <Cork> in the new html standard you have the form attribute, so you can put the field where ever you want and bind it to the form you want it on
[06:59:38] <Cork> abailarri_: didn't i answer that like 5 mins ago
[06:59:39] <BillCriswell> Cork: Haha. I didn't look into that yet.
[07:00:05] <abailarri_> Cork, my connection kick me of the chat
[07:00:24] <Cork> BillCriswell: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-form
[07:00:27] <abailarri_> can you answer?
[07:00:32] <Cork> BillCriswell: it is the attribute your using in prop
[07:01:03] <BillCriswell> Ah, I thought it was an input only property.
[07:01:21] <BillCriswell> Good times.
[07:01:28] <abailarri_> Cork, I fixed it
[07:01:30] <BillCriswell> Thought it would only be a getter.
[07:01:32] <Cork> abailarri_: http://pastebin.com/J0M4rXGZ
[07:01:51] <Cork> BillCriswell: it is
[07:02:07] <Cork> or if you meant it was a property only, then no
[07:02:46] <Cork> BillCriswell: btw not sure if it is supported in ie; or what version if it is
[07:03:00] <Cork> it is a quite new property after all
[07:06:10] <BillCriswell> I feel the need to research it.
[07:07:13] <Cork> BillCriswell: i've learnt to be VERY skeptical about info i find in so
[07:07:54] <Cork> cause most of the time it is "the next new thing" - no backwards compatibility, half baked so it is easy to break it or just plain wrong
[07:08:16] <BillCriswell> I recognized the guy from #web back when I first started using IRC. He taught me some really good habits (I think) so that's why I thought it would be relatively safe to use.
[07:08:55] <AlbinoGeek> Having quite an issue at the moment, in an AJAX-centric communication platform with 500ms updates, irregardless of which browser I try, the page crashes the whole browser in a matter of minutes (due to all the DOM.)  Is there any good way to manage the DOM and purge old elements, etc?
[07:10:08] <BillCriswell> Cork: He does mention html5 explicitly. I just didn't read carefully enough.
[07:11:35] <AlbinoGeek> As well: Is there any efficient way to compare an array of elements in the DOM to an array of element identifiers, removing ones that aren't in the identifiers list, and creating ones that did not previously exist?
[07:12:03] <BillCriswell> You're right about the no IE support. Friggin browser.
[07:12:51] <AlbinoGeek> Did we just have a netsplit or something, what's with all the joins?
[07:13:29] <BillCriswell> AlbinoGeek: Thats just this channel in general usually haha.
[07:13:52] <AlbinoGeek> Shame.
[07:13:59] <AlbinoGeek> ANy idea on the issue(s) I explained above?
[07:14:46] <AlbinoGeek> ...............
[07:14:53] <BillCriswell> That seems like a netsplit lol.
[07:14:55] <AlbinoGeek> 60 people just timed out at once, great.
[07:15:08] <AlbinoGeek> Odd, wallops didn't netsplit.
[07:15:16] <tw2113> ride the netsplit wave!
[07:15:27] <BillCriswell> AlbinoGeek: As for your issue I'm not really sure. I don't have too much experience with that type of issue.
[07:15:33] <Cork> wee
[07:15:42] <Cork> first time in a while i've been on the far side of a split
[07:15:47] <Cork> talk about flood
[07:15:57] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Really?  I'm on the far side every day :/.
[07:16:05] <AlbinoGeek> Well, at the moment it's a userlist (ie: who's on this page) listing.
[07:16:12] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: well i got like 50 messages in one second
[07:16:14] <AlbinoGeek> The userlist fetches the list of active users from the server, returned in json format.
[07:16:24] <Cork> 16:14:14 >_>
[07:16:37] <AlbinoGeek> I need to remove elements that are not returned in that list, and create elements that are not existing already in my DOM; etc.
[07:16:50] <AlbinoGeek> There doesn't seem to be any sane way to do this in JavaScript, or jQuery.
[07:17:07] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: so you want to compare two arrays of dom elements?
[07:17:11] <Cork> like jquery elements?
[07:17:22] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Nope, an array of dom elements .vs. a object of indicies.
[07:17:33] <Cork> "indicies"?
[07:17:42] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Each DOM element has a data-id="12345" that lines up with the object index.
[07:17:56] <Cork> ow
[07:18:02] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: then you need to loop
[07:18:13] <Cork> though that said, loops are cheap in js, so it should be ok
[07:18:18] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Except there's no way to sanely loop with both ends covered.
[07:18:23] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: You can't "JOIN" in JavaScript.
[07:18:35] <Cork> both ends covered?
[07:18:42] <Cork> double loops
[07:18:46] <AlbinoGeek> I can loop through the new resultset just fine; and create things that don't exist.
[07:19:01] <AlbinoGeek> But then there's no sane way to remove elements that don't exist in the new resultset.
[07:19:51] <BillCriswell> AlbinoGeek: The new list has all the current users, right?
[07:20:08] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: $.each(obj, function(key,val) { if($.inArray(arr, val)) {} })
[07:20:09] <AlbinoGeek> BillCriswell: The new set (JSON object) has the current list of all users.
[07:20:28] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Just no, $.each is 1000x slower than any sane loop in Vanilla JS.
[07:20:41] <AlbinoGeek> I'll just fiddle what I've got at the moment, so we're all on the same page.
[07:20:42] <Cork> not 1000
[07:20:47] <Cork> but ya it is slower
[07:20:50] <Cork> cause it create scopes
[07:20:53] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: You know it's bad when $.each own docs say not to use it.
[07:21:34] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: where exactly does it say that?
[07:21:51] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: or are you talking about $().each =
[07:21:53] <Cork> *?
[07:22:06] <AlbinoGeek> This is what I've got at the moment: http://piratepad.net/wvVSX2kBCa
[07:22:47] <AlbinoGeek> I've highlighted specifically the section in question.
[07:23:35] <AlbinoGeek> At the moment I re-create the list every time, which is alright, but is trashing the DOM.
[07:24:15] <BillCriswell> AlbinoGeek: Don't .append() a bunch of times, build an html string then use append() once.
[07:24:48] <pbodymind> yay people... any one has cool animations in jquery for christmas website decorations? im using this snow:http://www.schillmania.com/projects/snowstorm/
[07:27:21] <Cork> forEach isn't cross browser though
[07:27:21] <Cork> unless you don't care about ie8 and a few mobile that is
[07:28:10] <AlbinoGeek> Cork: Google doesn't care about IE8 or IE9.  Why should I?
[07:28:37] <Cork> AlbinoGeek: what google cares about shouldn't be the criteria for what you do
[07:28:45] <Cork> your visitor statistics should
[07:28:53] <AlbinoGeek> Cork:  My visitors use Google.  :/.
[07:30:40] <MickeySoFine> Hi all
[07:30:51] <AlbinoGeek> MickeySoFine: Ohai.
[07:30:54] <FrankDWork> IE8? because we care about some horrible corporations users? :P
[07:31:39] <AlbinoGeek> FrankDWork: or China...
[07:31:44] <MickeySoFine> I'm using $('#mycheckbox').is(':checked') to see if a checkbox is checked but it always returns false, is there a better way?
[07:32:15] <Cork> MickeySoFine: make sure you don't have two checkboxes with the same id
[07:32:30] <Cork> $('[id="mycheckbox"]').length
[07:32:31] <FrankDWork> yeah! or China!
[07:32:32] <FrankDWork> :P
[07:32:38] <Cork> it should never be anything other then 1
[07:33:27] <MickeySoFine> Cork yep only one found
[07:33:47] <Cork> MickeySoFine: try $('#mycheckbox').prop('checked')
[07:34:23] <Cork> MickeySoFine: btw, just to be sure; you arn't using attr('checked') to change the checked state right?
[07:35:08] <MickeySoFine> Cork prop returns undefined and I'n not changing the state at all I only want to check it
[07:35:25] <Cork> undefined...
[07:35:27] <MickeySoFine> well not changing it with code
[07:35:30] <Cork> are you targeting a checkbox?
[07:36:02] <Cork> (if you are really sure, please create a fiddle with a demo)
[07:36:06] <Cork> ?g jsfiddle
[07:36:08] <b-ot> Cork: JSFiddle: Create a new fiddle → http://jsfiddle.net/
[07:36:22] <BillCriswell> console.log( $('#mycheckbox')[0] );
[07:36:42] <MickeySoFine> Sorry Cork couldnt see the wood for the trees, looks like your right I had the id set on the next element down the dom :(
[07:37:00] <FrankDWork> is there a way to tell jQuery "HEY PAY ATTENTION TO THE NEW DIVS THAT I JUST PULLED IN VIA AJAX"?
[07:37:13] <AlbinoGeek> FrankDWork: Haha, I have that issue all the time.
[07:37:17] <Cork> FrankDWork: ?
[07:37:24] <FrankDWork> ive been including the script in the ajax response
[07:37:35] <Cork> that is easy to get wrong
[07:37:56] <Cork> if they relay on dom ready you most likely won't make it work
[07:38:00] <FrankDWork> and that doesnt work all that great, breaks some stuff (ie show/hide)
[07:38:47] <FrankDWork> no good way around that?
[07:38:56] <Cork> no it is how the dom works
[07:39:06] <Cork> dom ready doesn't help you in ajax calls
[07:39:09] <FrankDWork> that doesnt mean theres not a good solution
[07:39:28] <Cork> well either make sure your js is after all the dom element they need
[07:39:39] <Cork> that way you don't need dom ready, so it will work
[07:39:48] <FrankDWork> i wanted everything to be in one cohesive script, some of it is shared across views
[07:39:58] <Cork> also expect to run in global scope; meaning document.write and similar doesn't work
[07:40:11] <FrankDWork> hmm
[07:40:16] <Cork> if you do that it should work om
[07:40:18] <Cork> *ok
[07:40:23] <pothibo> I'm browsing the AJAX part of jquery and I'm wondering if there's a method to call a function on received data on every request AND make sure it's always called first
[07:40:37] <Cork> pothibo: here isn't
[07:40:45] <pothibo> Ok
[07:41:10] <Cork> pothibo: cause there isn't really a way to do so
[07:41:29] <Cork> pothibo: ajax can load a function through js and then execute it
[07:41:34] <pothibo> well, ajaxTransport is quite close to what I want to do but its not defiend
[07:41:42] <Cork> it can load html, that loads a function in global scope
[07:41:55] <pothibo> Yeah that's what I'm interesting with
[07:42:07] <Cork> just use the done callback and call it there
[07:42:22] <pothibo> yeah, but it can be called after another transport
[07:42:24] <pothibo> and it's my issue
[07:43:44] <FrankDWork> ok time to read!
[07:45:57] <BillCriswell> AlbinoGeek: Instead of comparing a list of dom nodes can't you just keep the old list and compare the two?
[07:49:18] <AlbinoGeek> PiratePad crashed, thanks though
[07:49:57] <BillCriswell> Huh?
[07:55:55] <shoky> AlbinoGeek ;p
[07:56:15] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: :)
[07:56:28] <shoky> This page will automatically reload 1 minute and 55 seconds after Piratepad should've been restarted.
[07:56:35] <shoky> wtf does that mean
[07:56:43] <AlbinoGeek> shoky: Was it you I was screwing around with yesterday on PiratePad?
[07:56:54] <shoky> yesterday? don't think so
[07:57:01] <AlbinoGeek> Ah.
[07:57:01] <shoky> was me now tho ;p
[07:57:04] <AlbinoGeek> Yeah :).
[07:57:26] <AlbinoGeek> Quite annoying that JavaScript is being slower than Microsoft to adapt standards....
[07:57:27] <AlbinoGeek> Eugh.
[07:57:38] <AlbinoGeek> If IE does it before JS, that's just sad.
[07:59:28] <AlbinoGeek> Oh great, new Date(unix_timestamp) is invalid too?
[07:59:29] <AlbinoGeek> Really?
[07:59:41] <shoky> invalid?
[07:59:49] <AlbinoGeek> new Date(user.when).toISOString() >>> RangeError: invalid date
[08:00:10] <AlbinoGeek> (where user.when is a unix timestamp about 30 seconds ago.)
[08:00:16] <shoky> oh you prolly need to multiply by 1000
[08:00:32] <AlbinoGeek> >not supporting unix timestamps, 2013
[08:23:09] <hlve> o.o
[08:59:21] <sunbeam> Anyone in here using masonry or isotope to fit full width at all times?
[09:37:52] <hlve> is there a good one line way to comma format a number inside a specific paragraph tag?
[09:38:51] <hlve> mind you, this is carried across multiple paragraph tags with the same class
[10:53:18] <hibiki> does anyone know of any plugin that imitates the behavior of facebook's hashtag feature which does a typeahead below the textarea after you type in the # character and after you select from the typeahead menu, the hashtag is made to look css decorated within the textarea?
[10:54:02] <hibiki> i found this one, but it only puts double quotes around the hashtag:  http://www.s3maphor3.org/tagdragon/
[11:34:46] <lethjakman> hey, does anyone know of a good library for making a regular form multi part with conditional branches? or is it best to just build it on my own?
[12:59:12] <hailwood> Hi guys, any idea why two subsequent requests to a (slightly different) url end up waiting for the first one to finish before either of them return? Here is what the requests look like http://i.imgur.com/YLWw2Nr.png
[13:02:31] <hailwood> And here is the code that does the actual request: http://pastebin.com/C1z4dq2T
[13:09:37] <dblosevn> hailwood: reading your code (although I cant see request timings) what I see in the network tab seems to be what I would expect from reading your code. Keeping in mind javascript is single threaded. first request is triggered immedately &start=1 then waits 2.5 seconds before firing the status call.
[13:10:19] <dblosevn> sorry 5 seconds not 2.5 the subsequent status calls are 2.5 secs
[13:12:46] <shoky> he's asking about when they end, not when they start
[13:12:56] <dblosevn> ah I guess I was blind, I see the timings now, are you using php sessions?
[13:13:45] <shoky> yah it's prolly a serverside issue
[13:14:10] <dblosevn> ive had issues trying to open the same session before on 2 different connections, the first requests blocks all future requests until it completes
[13:14:30] <dblosevn> the solution is to open the session write a value commit the session and not leave it open forever
[13:15:14] <dblosevn> espessally on long running tasks
[13:15:39] <dblosevn> *especially
[13:15:46] <dblosevn> whatever I just woke up :-)
[13:15:53] <dblosevn> sup shoky long time no talk
[13:16:24] <shoky> ;] all's good. i'm just goin to sleep
[13:16:27] <shoky> sups
[13:16:40] <dblosevn> nada still bustin my butt on the CAT apps
[13:16:59] <dblosevn> keep making changes at the end of the project that have stop me from releasing them :-(
[13:17:27] <shoky> sounds like business as usual, sadly
[13:17:46] <dblosevn> in the end though it is a really native feeling jqm app one of the most native ive seen
[13:18:17] <shoky> phonegap?
[13:18:20] <dblosevn> theres only like 2 places in the UI that give away its jqm/phonegap
[13:18:53] <dblosevn> ya
[13:19:05] <shoky> i haven't tried it yet ;s
[13:19:23] <dblosevn> it has its quirks but overall I think its an awesome platform
[13:20:39] <shoky> no slowness/jittery animation that i've heard about?
[13:21:09] <shoky> regarding jqm at least
[13:21:10] <dblosevn> of course but I think thats more poor android/jqm performance I disabled all the animations
[13:21:27] <shoky> ah
[13:22:01] <dblosevn> because even in chrome my note 10.1, note 2, galaxy nexus 10 all choke on page animations
[13:22:07] <dblosevn> without phonegap
[13:22:22] <shoky> ;[
[13:23:19] <dblosevn> safari on ios seems to handle them better though
[13:25:03] <shoky> not something you can share, i guess?
[13:25:07] <dblosevn> I did however have to build a custom loader for jqm being it really doesnt support prerendering a template on the client side it kind of expects the template to be prerendereed on the server
[13:26:04] <dblosevn> not on a publically logged channel :-) pm me ill shoot you an apk though
[13:53:32] <dekiss> please tell me some premade jquery image slider

[14:06:08] <logikos> what is the best way to test if a var is a dom object or a jquery object .. such as: var a = getElementById('someid'), b = $('#someid');
[14:06:32] <logikos> how can i test a var to know if it is a jquery object like b or a dom object like a
[14:06:44] <logikos> typeof obviously just shows both as objects
[14:08:49] <dekiss> please tell me some premade jquery image slider horizontal scroling image slider so iI don't reinvent the wheel :) I need image slider that will slide small thumbnails horizontaly constantly
[14:08:56] <dekiss> sorry double post mistake
[14:10:54] <size> logikos you could verify for .nodeType in dom elements
[14:10:56] <size> or .jquery
[14:11:15] <size> for example
[14:11:26] <anEffingChamp> dekiss: Should they slide as a unit, or asynchronously?
[14:11:34] <size> function isDOM(el) { return el.nodeType == 1; }
[14:12:17] <dekiss> anEffingChamp how you mean
[14:12:30] <dekiss> they need to slide from right to left
[14:12:43] <dekiss> I have two arrows when clicking should scroll horizontally

[14:16:44] <zizzl> Hey guys I am having an issue... I have an anchor link, scrolling to a div on a page, works fine, but when it also triggers a .slideToggle as well, the scroll is stopped very short
[14:17:48] <dekiss> anEffingChamp thank you !
[14:17:51] <dekiss> let me check those
[14:33:48] <dekiss> can I make this thing move? http://www.nikolakis.net/liquidcarousel/
[14:35:31] <dekiss> auto move I mean to auto start
[14:35:32] <murph> I wand to do .find(':submit') or :image - What's the syntax for that?

[14:44:50] <eddym> Good Afternoon everyone...
[14:45:21] <eddym> I'm having trouble with a sticky / scrolling sidebar thought someone might be able to help me figure out why it keeps pushing my footer down, making the site sort of "infinite"
[14:45:44] <eddym> Site: www.trustcashmobile.com Code: http://jsfiddle.net/dTd7U/
[14:52:50] <anthonym> What would cause the success: and failure: to not trigger in an ajax call, even tho my console says 200 OK on the ajax request?
[14:53:11] <eddym> think you can help?
[14:54:37] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[14:54:53] <Starcraftmazter> im having real problems with various jquery/jquery extensions like timer() overriding this
[14:55:43] <duch_kazatel> Starcraftmazter what do you mean?
[14:56:15] <dekiss> can I make this thing move? http://www.nikolakis.net/liquidcarousel/ auto move on start
[14:57:47] <Starcraftmazter> duch_kazatel: when inside a class, you use this to refer to other functions and data members, but inside things like click() and timer() - they ovreride this with themselves
[14:57:58] <Starcraftmazter> its really annoying
[15:01:28] <eddym> anybody available?
[15:02:16] <anthonym> can someone tell me why success: and failure: arent triggering in this? http://pastebin.com/C4uX7XgW
[15:06:45] <coldhead> anthonym: is your JS hosted on test-ep.tsys.osblast.org
[15:07:06] <anthonym> yeah
[15:07:15] <anthonym> and I get a 200 OK response
[15:07:45] <anthonym> [09:58:55.469] POST http://test-ep.tsys.osblast.org/login_with_facebook [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 490ms]
[15:08:35] <anthonym> No Response Body
[15:08:36] <anthonym> interesting.
[15:10:42] <anthonym> What would cause it to have no response body? thats odd.
[15:10:58] <anthonym> Even if I go to the URL http://test-ep.tsys.osblast.org/login_with_facebook , ive coded it to have a default response body.
[15:11:19] <coldhead> my man, i think you want "error" instead of "failure"
[15:12:03] <coldhead> and i would guess the error that is occurring is a lack of JSON data in the response
[15:15:23] <anthonym> thanks mate,
[15:15:24] <anthonym> Error! {"readyState":0,"responseText":"","status":0,"statusText":"error"
[15:15:35] <anthonym> responseText is null. What would be causing that?
[15:15:43] <anthonym> because even by default, theres a default json response.
[15:18:15] <anthonym> apparently when you are using JSON with jQuery, if the answer data are not wellformed (like a space before / after the starting JSON string) could lead to a blank answer from jQuery.  ?
[15:18:19] <anthonym> But i've now set it to text
[15:30:20] <anthonym> fixed thanks guys
[15:44:33] <krambiorix> hi, i want to check if there's an element with a class name starting with "123" -> is that possible without explicit looping?
[15:50:06] <Starcraftmazter> how do i pass arguments to closures?
[15:51:33] <snover> Starcraftmazter: whatever you think a closure is, is not.
[15:53:38] <Starcraftmazter> ok
[16:01:16] <Starcraftmazter> if i try to provide an argument to a closure/anonymous function which i am putting in $.timer(), it doesnt work
[16:01:18] <Starcraftmazter> why is this
[16:01:18] <Starcraftmazter> :S
[16:15:29] <krambiorix> i get a firefox error that my script takes too long, what can the problem be? http://jsbin.com/OQULOhUH/1/watch?html,js,output  (only js)
[16:16:24] <krambiorix> is it normal that i get the timeout?
[16:16:35] <dekiss> can I make this thing move? http://www.nikolakis.net/liquidcarousel/ auto move on start
[17:08:10] <Velveeta> krambiorix: $('[class^="123"], [class*=" 123"]') should do it for your question from almost an hour and a half ago… starcraftmazter: can we see a code sample of your closure and the parameter you're trying to pass, and what $.timer has to do with any of that? krambiorix: if you have a 250-iteration loop dom-parsing, it's probably going to hang the browser, you can break that up with a setTimeout of 1ms per iteration to allow the bro
[17:08:11] <Velveeta> tasks between iteratons… dekiss: you can probably rig up a setInterval that triggers a click on the left or right arrows to make your carousel autocycle
[17:22:02] <Starcraftmazter> Velveeta: apparently timer expects a closure which takes no arguments
[17:22:11] <Starcraftmazter> ive worked (very far) around the problem
[17:22:14] <Starcraftmazter> so i guess its ok now
[18:33:54] <jjforums> can discuss vcs here?
[18:34:49] <ir7466> Hello, I'm looking for a transition where the page I'm on fades out and and t he page I am directing to fades in. is this possible?
[18:35:42] <ir7466> I'd appreciate any best practice advice on this too
[18:41:29] <Ricas> This: http://pastebin.com/ahxhbADJ procudes this error: POST http://beer.l/[object%20Object] 400 (Bad Request) in jquery.min.js:4. Am I doing something wrong?
[18:47:01] <useff> ?
[18:52:46] <tw2113> Ricas, my bet is that game.gameID is an object and not a property of an object
[19:31:15] <abishek> hi, could someone advice on what could be wrong in here http://jsfiddle.net/EqwkQ/95/ ? The animation gets applied to the whole table and the animation only fires one. Please advice
[20:00:32] <ekkis> guys, if I have an array of radio buttons and capture a click event, how can I tell what the index of the clicked button is within the array of buttons that it belongs to?
[20:00:59] <ekkis> $(this) contains that button, but how do I know which index of the array it is in?
[20:07:39] <sayd> one does not.. simply build jquery-ui from source
[21:04:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi you up or sleeping?
[21:34:13] <ekkis> evening everyone, if I have an array of radio buttons and capture a click event, how can I tell what the index of the clicked button is within the array of buttons that it belongs to?
[21:34:18] <ekkis> $(this) contains that button, but how do I know which index of the array it is in?
[21:35:43] <ali4ever4> ekkis:  ummm  not sure of the best practice , but i would give each radio botton an ID when getting it i would do $(this).attr("id");
[21:37:46] <ekkis> ali4ever4: I want to build a generic solution but need to figure out how to tell the index
[21:38:23] <ekkis> actually, I think $(this).parent().index() may work...
[21:45:32] <ali4ever4> ekkis: umm looks good , but what argument you will supply to .index() ?!
[21:45:47] <ali4ever4> ekkis: i think it has to be Id of the current element
[21:45:58] <ekkis> none
[21:46:16] <ekkis> it seems to work
[21:48:25] <ali4ever4> ekkis: cool
[22:11:39] <crowemi> coldhead: you have a minute to take a look at the jQuery? The $.get that is returning 403 on third iteration
[22:15:29] <richcollins> Can I attach event listeners to element before they're added to the document?
[22:17:38] <ali4ever4> richcollins: using on http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:18:05] <ali4ever4> richcollins: attach to the parent of the element you are going to add
[22:19:07] <richcollins> $("<div></div>").on("click", function(){ console.log("clicked") }).appendTo($("body")) isn't working
[22:20:14] <richcollins> ali4ever4: to the parent?
[22:32:13] <richcollins> ali4ever4: Why would you attach to the parent, I want the event to fire when the click happens on the child
[22:34:38] <richcollins> Ah I see
[22:34:42] <richcollins> "Direct and delegated events"
[22:34:44] <richcollins> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:50:47] <TTomiK> I'm using typeahead.js... How can I set the query variable to POST data ?
[22:51:06] <TTomiK> I don't want to use GET-method
[22:57:46] <TTomiK> anyone?
[23:07:37] <grafi> no idea, its probably in the docs, whats wrong with get
[23:11:16] <grafi> TTomiK https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/issues/542#issuecomment-29995960
[23:13:11] <TTomiK> I've already done the background coding with POST, but after done that I found out the typeahead.js is better than Bootstrap's typeahead :)
[23:14:09] <grafi> well, changing the background to accept get requests shouldnt be terribly hard?`
[23:14:43] <TTomiK> it isn't... But I still prefer post :)
[23:15:06] <TTomiK> ... and I don't understand why it couldn't be supported
[23:15:50] <TTomiK> queryInput is not defined says the browser with the github-link you pasted
[23:16:35] <TTomiK> do I have to download the branch somehow? (I'm not too familiar with github)
[23:20:03] <grafi> huh?
[23:31:19] <angelazou> hi, I'm using jQuery append to append some elements to the end of a div, and I need to access it immediately after append
[23:31:40] <angelazou> however, the selector came back with empty results
[23:31:50] <Cork> angelazou: use $() to parse it before you append it
[23:32:25] <Cork> var newContent = $(data); $(target).append(newContent); newContent.on('click',...)
[23:32:47] <Cork> or alternatively
[23:33:04] <Cork> $(data).appendTo(target).on('click',...)
[23:33:16] <angelazou> Cork: actually they are...I generate them from an Ajax result, and save to a global var. already $()
[23:33:29] <angelazou> When accessing, I just append content from that global var
[23:33:46] <Cork> then you should already have the element
[23:34:32] <angelazou> when I console log the global var, I get something like this x.fn.x.init[5]
[23:34:43] <angelazou> I'm assuming that means it's a jQuery obj?
[23:34:56] <Cork> depends on the debugger but ya
[23:35:07] <Cork> gvar[0] would be the first dom element in the jquery array
[23:35:13] <Cork> [1] the second and so on
[23:36:18] <krambiorix> Cork, can i pick your brain for a moment?  -> http://jsbin.com/OQULOhUH/1/edit  ---> i get a firefox timeout on this.... Is there any way to bypass the timeout?
[23:38:30] <Cork> krambiorix: only option it to make the loop async
[23:38:45] <krambiorix> Cork, how can i do that?
[23:38:56] <Cork> setTimeout or sendMessage
[23:39:37] <krambiorix> Cork, i tried setTimeout but i still get the timeout
[23:40:44] <Cork> krambiorix: also $("[id^="+$(this).text()+"]") <-- this is a really slow selector
[23:40:49] <krambiorix> Cork, i put alle my code in another function and call it like : setTimeout('$(this).doAutoload()', 0);  -> that's what you mean, no?
[23:40:51] <Cork> try replacing it with a class selector
[23:41:08] <Cork> krambiorix: never EVER give a string to setTimeout
[23:41:29] <krambiorix> Cork, i found it documented like a string
[23:41:35] <Cork> no
[23:41:52] <Cork> that documentation would be for how setTimeout was used ~ 15 years ago
[23:41:56] <Cork> give it a function
[23:42:09] <Cork> just like you do for .each or event callbacks
[23:42:26] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/OQULOhUH/2/edit
[23:42:31] <Cork> this should make it a tiny bit better
[23:42:50] <Cork> but you should prob fix that selector
[23:43:01] <Cork> opps
[23:43:19] <Cork> forgot the starter
[23:43:44] <Cork> and... some other stuff...
[23:43:46] <Cork> let me fix it
[23:44:36] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/OQULOhUH/3/edit there
[23:45:02] <Cork> krambiorix: though like i said suggestions: 1. don't use attribute selectors; especially not for id's
[23:45:11] <krambiorix> Cork, testing...
[23:45:16] <Cork> 2. try to add classes so you can do this selection effectively
[23:45:59] <Cork> and 3. if you can't reduce the match count through classes you would have to make the second each loop async too; and that makes it a bit... messy
[23:46:22] <TheJHNZ> is there an easy way to slide left?
[23:46:25] <TheJHNZ> $(this).parent().find('input').toggle("slide", { direction: "left" }, 1000);
[23:46:31] <TheJHNZ> this doesnt seem to want to work
[23:52:08] <krambiorix> Cork, it works!!  so i replace all id's by classes ?
[23:52:15] <TheJHNZ> oo
[23:52:17] <TheJHNZ> o.o
[23:52:25] <Cork> krambiorix: you create class groups
[23:52:38] <Cork> krambiorix: so you don't need to use ^=
[23:53:06] <Cork> ex. if you need to match .section1-row1
[23:53:16] <Cork> split those into two classes
[23:53:31] <Cork> then you could just do $('.section1')
[23:53:47] <Cork> krambiorix: basically use classes as keywords
[23:54:27] <krambiorix> Cork, yeah but i work with serial numbers
[23:54:52] <Cork> and those can't be split into groups at all?
[23:55:44] <TheJHNZ> $(this).parent().find('input').toggle("slide", { direction: "left" }, 1000);
[23:55:48] <TheJHNZ> why doesnt this work ?
[23:55:53] <Cork> just to be clear $('[id^=""]') is the second slowest selector you can make
[23:56:13] <Cork> TheJHNZ: might be cause of the parent, not sure; are you loading jquery ui?
[23:56:26] <TheJHNZ> nope just jq
[23:56:32] <Cork> then that's why
[23:56:35] <Cork> slide is part of ui
[23:58:10] <TheJHNZ> thanks
[23:58:17] <TheJHNZ> how would i stop it cutting off like this? http://joshua.geek.nz/s/DERP12-17-20-58-03.png

[23:58:53] <crocket> where can I find the documentation of double sign selector?
[23:59:03] <crocket> where can I find the documentation of double dollar sign selector?

[23:59:32] <crocket> What are tehy?
[23:59:33] <Cork> i don't think there is a $$ though
[23:59:38] <crocket> $$ exists.
[23:59:51] <krambiorix> Cork, i don't see how to group them
