[01:29:55] <Lenswipee> is there a way to set cursor position of textarea to 0?
[01:47:49] <pavonia> Lenswipee: .prop("selectionEnd", 0) or something
[01:48:30] <Lenswipee> pavonia: i'll look into that. thanks
[02:30:00] <Lenswipee> pavonia: you might be one of the few active helpers on here
[03:01:37] <Cork> Lenswipee: there isn't a prop (or any direct jquery) method that is cross browser as far as i know
[03:02:25] <Lenswipee> Cork: $('.shareMsgInput')[0].setSelectionRange(0,0); <-- this is what I ended up with.
[03:02:40] <Cork> there is one object you use for gecko/blink/webkit and one for edge/trident
[03:02:47] <Cork> Lenswipee: that won't be compatible
[03:03:46] <Lenswipee> Cork: works for most i believe
[03:04:11] <Cork> Lenswipee: ya, except all ms based ones
[03:04:37] <Lenswipee> Cork: ms = microsoft?
[03:04:42] <Cork> yes
[03:05:00] <Cork> Lenswipee: this is what you need https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3169786/clear-text-selection-with-javascript
[03:05:03] <Lenswipee> Cork: Well it works on Edge
[03:05:06] <Cork> (there is a jquery plugin for it as far as i know)
[03:05:39] <Cork> hmm except those are for documents... damn...
[03:06:37] <Lenswipee> I'm happy enough it works on Edge :-)
[03:06:37] <Cork> ah... i remembered wrong it was opera that used a different selection form
[03:06:48] <Cork> and as it is dead since long there is only one; nice!
[03:07:50] <Lenswipee> I like to talk to you about escaping data on client-side with jquery
[03:08:31] <Lenswipee> does jquery have functions for that?
[03:08:50] <Cork> escaping data?
[03:08:54] <Cork> define "data" :)
[03:09:57] <Lenswipee> For example, ajax request returns server-side data to script for appending to page.
[03:10:24] <Lenswipee> lets call that example 1
[03:13:18] <Lenswipee> that data is a string, which may or may not contain html in it.
[03:15:02] <Cork> ok, extreamly vague...
[03:15:18] <Cork> and what exactly is it you want to escape?
[03:15:46] <Lenswipee> firstly does that string data need escaping with jquery?
[03:16:01] <Cork> depends
[03:16:10] <Cork> do you trust the source to not contain xss?
[03:16:35] <Cork> meaning is the content something you generate server side without using user input?
[03:16:42] <Lenswipee> Well the source is server-side data comming from MySQL db.
[03:16:55] <Cork> and the mysql data isn't from user inputs?
[03:17:03] <Lenswipee> Correct
[03:17:11] <Cork> then "no"
[03:17:30] <Lenswipee> OK, good. Now let's say the data is from user input :-)
[03:17:45] <Cork> then you shouldn't send html from the server side
[03:18:07] <Cork> or don't mix the html and user put and then set the values in the html in js
[03:18:18] <Cork> or, have the server handle the input escape
[03:18:41] <Cork> but if you get an html blob from the server there isn't much js can do
[03:19:09] <Lenswipee> "isn't much js can do" meaning?
[03:19:37] <Cork> well when you send html from the server to js, all js can do is take the blob and jam it into the dom and let the browser parse it
[03:19:54] <Cork> what html tags tha are good and bad isn't easy to differenciate at that point
[03:20:16] <Lenswipee> are you open to XSS by doing that?
[03:20:35] <Cork> depends if the code generating the html filters
[03:20:41] <Cork> if it doesn't, then probably
[03:21:13] <Lenswipee> right.
[03:21:28] <Lenswipee> Next...
[03:21:36] <Cork> also if you care about this you should most likely use csp on the site
[03:21:50] <Cork> but that is a last line of extra help, you shouldn't depend on it
[03:22:16] <Cork> and that means remove ALL inline scripts from the site
[03:22:18] <Lenswipee> How to best handle if data is a string (containing html and values from user-input) on the client-side using jquery?
[03:22:43] <Cork> well if they are mixed: you don't
[03:23:26] <Cork> if you get server html and user inputs (as strings) separately: parse the html with $($.parseHTML(serverHTML)); then find the input positions in the parsed structure
[03:23:48] <Cork> and do parsedServerMarkup.find('#target1').text(userInput1);;
[03:24:07] <Cork> that way the user can't send html tags
[03:24:19] <Cork> as if they do it will be parsed as text not html
[03:24:43] <Cork> (so you get the text <script></script> instead of the browser executing the script)
[03:26:19] <Lenswipee> do functions like .text() do the escaping?
[03:26:46] <Cork> .text is just a wrapper around elm.inlineText =
[03:27:20] <Cork> so it differs in how you give the content to the dom
[03:29:03] <Lenswipee> PHP DATA: echo '<div><?php $_POST['foo'];?></div>';
[03:29:15] <Lenswipee> how to best handle that on client-side using jquery?
[03:29:26] <Cork> you can't
[03:30:56] <Lenswipee> would it be safe to then do if(data.length > 0) {data.append('selector');}
[03:33:07] <Lenswipee> you can't?
[03:33:15] <Lenswipee> i just did
[03:37:34] <Lenswipee> Cork u still there?
[03:37:46] <Lenswipee> or you done with this discussion?
[04:16:20] <Cork> heh well i have other things i need to do too :)

[06:41:34] <Rockwood> or his relative?:P
[06:42:26] <Lenswipee> i'm his troll brother
[06:43:59] <Rockwood> Lenswipee, ah okay nice relation then
[06:45:17] * Lenswipee is away from keyboard
[06:45:59] <Rockwood> not fair
[06:50:15] <Lenswipee> FYI, Woet = Rockwood . Good try trolling.
[06:51:55] <Rockwood> its not fair
[06:51:58] <Rockwood> :P
[07:38:19] <chawixxx> hi! anybody knows how to use typeahead + bloodhound ? I'm using the remote way to retreive objects from my database, by I cannot show all the objects by default without prefetch... any idea?
[07:38:41] <chawixxx> https://thepasteb.in/p/BghPrXn9rA2TY
[07:38:46] <chawixxx> here's my code
[07:40:37] <chawixxx> tried this solution but didn't work http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/#default-suggestions
[07:49:42] <Cork> chawixxx: have you checked so the server responds with the correct format?
[07:53:20] <chawixxx> yeah
[07:56:17] <Rockwood> Cork, o/
[07:56:35] <Cork> *waves*
[07:56:47] <Cork> chawixxx: hmm, and no js errors?
[07:57:04] <chawixxx> no, anything
[07:57:35] <Cork> could you try making a jsfiddle with the code? (if the remote endpoint is usable)
[07:57:36] <Rockwood> Cork, i am facing issue in use of https://notifyjs.jpillora.com/
[07:58:03] <chawixxx> when I do a search it works, but my intention is when you click on the search field and leave it empty it should return everything
[07:58:52] <chawixxx> nope, I cannot provide the remote
[08:00:38] <Cork> ya, as i haven't ever used it i can't really help much
[08:13:12] <Rockwood> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/693384/  can i add notify js here?
[08:13:22] <Rockwood> if yes then hows?
[08:25:32] <Cork> Rockwood: not even sure what the plugin does
[08:25:51] <Cork> the page uses broken resources (rawgit instead of the real cdn uri)
[08:31:48] <Rockwood> Cork, its for notification
[08:32:00] <Rockwood> notifications
[08:32:10] <Rockwood> like on error or on success
[08:32:35] <Cork> ya, i can guess at what it is for, but there demos doesn't work so i don't know what a successful call would look like
[08:33:20] <Rockwood> "doesn't work" where?
[08:33:41] <Cork> on there page
[08:33:44] <Rockwood> https://notifyjs.jpillora.com/
[08:33:48] <Rockwood> here?
[08:33:52] <Cork> yes
[08:34:11] <Cork> the browser gets text/html for the script tag so it doesn't execute
[08:34:13] <Rockwood> do noticed on pops
[08:34:23] <Rockwood> do you*
[08:34:36] * Cork afk
[08:34:42] <Rockwood> ah okay
[08:35:00] <Rockwood> we can talk when you back
[08:36:52] <Rockwood> any more is active here?
[09:54:39] <arunkumar413> I have a div with the class name test. How do I select the button immediately after this class
[09:59:33] <Cork> after this div you mean?
[09:59:37] <Cork> or inside it?
[10:03:29] <arunkumar413> Cork: I solved it
[10:04:04] <arunkumar413> But now how to clone a class and append the cloned class just after the last added element
[10:04:24] <Cork> arunkumar413: i don't follow, a class is just a string
[10:04:39] <Cork> do you mean the element found by a class selector?
[10:04:57] <arunkumar413> Cork: I mean an div with a class
[10:05:23] <arunkumar413> how do I copy a div with a class name and append it just after the that div
[10:05:42] <Cork> i get what you mean, but it isn't "with a class"
[10:05:45] <Cork> it is clone an element
[10:05:51] <Cork> and that is .clone()
[10:06:06] <Cork> $('div.the-class') == gives you a list of the elements matched by the selector
[10:06:07] <arunkumar413> say for example I have div with class education. I want to add another education. So I want to copy the div and append just after that
[10:06:21] <Cork> result.clone() <-- clones the elements and gives you a net set of elements
[10:07:03] <Cork> source = $('div.education'); source.after(source.clone());
[10:07:09] <Cork> will give you a clone of the element
[10:08:03] <Cork> if you want to modify the contnet of the element it is better to do that before you append it with .after()
[10:08:57] <arunkumar413> Cork: Is this valid: $(".edu:first").clone().append(".edu:last");
[10:09:08] <Cork> no
[10:09:43] <Cork> that would clone .edu:first and replace all the content in it with the text ".edu:last" and then throw away the new element as nothing reference it anymore
[10:09:48] <arunkumar413> Cork: Is this valid: $(".edu:first").clone().appendTo(".edu");
[10:10:03] <Cork> if you want it inside the first element, ya
[10:10:44] <arunkumar413> I want it as a seperate div with the same class name. Not as a child
[10:11:00] <Cork> i gave you that
[10:11:11] <arunkumar413> <div class ='edu'> <div class ='edu'>
[10:11:14] <arunkumar413> like this
[10:11:20] <Cork> that is a child
[10:11:24] <arunkumar413> sorry
[10:11:47] <arunkumar413> <div class ='edu'> </div>  <div class ='edu'>  </div>
[10:11:49] <arunkumar413> like this
[10:11:57] <Cork> see above...
[10:12:04] <Cork> i already gave you how to do this
[10:12:33] <arunkumar413> this one source = $('div.education'); source.after(source.clone());
[10:12:49] <Cork> yes, if you don't want to modify the new element
[10:13:04] <arunkumar413> But I want to select or clone only the first element
[10:13:13] <arunkumar413> not all the elements with the class
[10:13:15] <Cork> if you have multiple and not clone all of them you want a .first() or :first in the source selection
[10:14:18] <arunkumar413> source = $('education:first'); source.after(source.clone());
[10:14:30] <arunkumar413> what about inserting at the last div
[10:14:48] <Cork> replace first with :last is one option
[10:15:12] <Cork> or replace at the source.after() with $('.education:last').after()
[10:15:14] <arunkumar413> Cork: that's cloning
[10:15:19] <Cork> no it isn't
[10:17:03] <arunkumar413> source = $('education:first'); $('.education:last').after(source.clone());
[10:17:33] <arunkumar413> Cork: will the above work?
[10:19:50] <Cork> yes
[10:21:02] <arunkumar413> Cork: initially, theres is only one div with class div. Is the first and last point to the same for cloning and inserting
[10:21:23] <Cork> arunkumar413: what do you think?
[10:21:44] <arunkumar413> It should point to the same
[10:22:43] <arunkumar413> Cork: I just tried the above solution and it's not cloning and inserting: https://jsfiddle.net/arunkumar413/Ly4o6jfh/49/
[10:24:25] <taplar> typo on your first selector
[10:24:35] <taplar> line 5
[10:27:26] <arunkumar413> taplar: Thanks, it's working now
[10:45:26] <interop_madness> should a plugin's destroy function be chainable?
[10:45:50] <taplar> don't see why it couldn't be
[10:46:41] <thecliguy> Hi. Please can someone explain why the callback function 'handleData' is never fired in this example? https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/694628/
[10:47:04] <interop_madness> init function probably as well?
[10:47:28] <taplar> thecliguy: it's getting a CORS error on fiddle
[10:47:30] <taplar> look at your console
[10:47:45] <interop_madness> i' writing coding guidelines, so i need to be somewhat anal on that. is "make everything chainable that does not need to return a value" a good guideline for jQuery plugins?
[10:47:56] <taplar> interop_madness: sure.  typically jQuery methods return the object they operated upon, unless they are expected to return something else.
[10:48:17] <interop_madness> ok, i'm gonna go with that - thanks taplar
[10:48:58] <thecliguy> Ahh - its to do with the origin of the request and the destination differing.
[10:49:10] <taplar> yep
[10:53:22] <thecliguy> Should it work if i call jsfiddle.net?
[10:53:39] <taplar> i would think so
[10:54:06] <thecliguy> I still seem to get nothing.
[10:54:20] <taplar> jsfiddle has some ajax echo endpoints you could hit as well
[10:54:48] <thecliguy> Ah, there was another error in the console: "An iframe which has both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin for its sandbox attribute can remove its sandboxing."
[10:55:10] <thecliguy> Well, a warning I think, not an error.
[10:55:36] <thecliguy> Do you know where I can find the endpoint addresses? Are they listed somewhere?
[10:56:15] <taplar> i'm trying to get to them, but my network has decided it doesn't want to resolve jsfiddle for me at the moment ...
[10:57:20] <taplar> or i may just be having over all network issues.  brb
[10:58:13] <taplar> whomp whomp
[10:58:18] <thecliguy> welcome back
[10:58:30] <taplar> ok, left hand side, see the "Async requests" text?  click that
[10:58:57] <thecliguy> Ahh, got it.
[10:58:59] <thecliguy> Thanks
[11:07:24] <Rockwood> taplar, o/
[11:07:33] <taplar> morning
[11:08:08] <Rockwood> its night here but have good one :) hope  we know each
[11:08:24] <Rockwood> brb
[11:08:57] <thecliguy> taplar: Thank you. All working now.
[11:09:14] <taplar> awesome
[11:12:27] <thecliguy> The reason for doing it in jsfiddle is because I have implemented practically the same functions on my own site but it doesn't work. The console shows "TypeError: getData(...) is undefined".
[11:13:01] <thecliguy> Is there a logical starting point to troubleshoot such a problem?
[11:13:15] <taplar> confirm the scope of the function
[11:13:35] <taplar> identify if it is a global method, or if it is scoped to a function or in a variable
[11:14:08] <taplar> and if it is in a variable, identify the scope of that variable
[11:15:59] <thecliguy> Hummm... I'm not really familiar with scoping rules in javascript.
[11:16:33] <taplar> If you make a function inside the <script> tags, it will be a global
[11:16:45] <taplar> if you make a function within another function, it's scope is only in that function
[11:16:57] <thecliguy> I should say, this is all inline javascript.
[11:17:03] <taplar> function a() { function b() {}    b(); }
[11:17:03] <thecliguy> if it makes any difference.
[11:17:23] <taplar> can you show me a snippet of how your script is structured on your site?
[11:18:47] <thecliguy> OK, so javascript doesn't cascades scopes. So local scope can't access objects defined in ancestor scopes (parent, grandparent...)
[11:19:07] <taplar> accessable scope goes up
[11:19:23] <thykka> totally can
[11:19:57] <taplar> a sub scope has access to all higher scope elements
[11:19:59] <thykka> var a = 'foo'; var b = function() { return a; }; b(); //==> 'foo'
[11:20:04] <thecliguy> Ah sorry. I think i read your response in the complete opposite.
[11:20:51] <thecliguy> so the local scope always contains objects defined in ancestor scopes (parent, grandparent, global, etc).
[11:21:11] <taplar> it will find them
[11:21:19] <thecliguy> life will find a way.
[11:21:25] <thykka> var a = 'foo'; var b = function() { var a = 'bar'; return a; }; b(); /*==> 'bar' */ a; //==> 'foo'
[11:21:51] <taplar> js will try to find your variable at it's current scope, before trying to find it at a higher scope
[11:23:52] <thecliguy> Give me a sec - I'll show you what I have like you asked...
[11:24:01] <taplar> k
[11:26:59] <thecliguy> An excerpt of the relevant bits: https://bpaste.net/show/a0163f86516a
[11:27:50] <taplar> ok, so getData() is defined inside the function passed to the document ready, so it only exists inside that function
[11:28:16] <taplar> line 18-20 is also a child of the document ready, so it will have access to the getData() method
[11:29:17] <taplar> not sure if it is a copy and paste error, but your document ready isn't properly closed there.
[11:30:08] <thecliguy> sorry, copy paste error. should be });
[11:30:13] <taplar> k
[11:31:00] <taplar> so yeah, I don't see any scope issues with that snippet
[11:31:40] <taplar> oh, but you do have an issue with your method
[11:31:55] <taplar> getData() doesn't have a return before the $.ajax
[11:31:56] <thykka> event handler scope is wrogn
[11:32:11] <taplar> so it's not going to return the promise for you to be able to attach the then() to
[11:32:58] <thykka> there's not really much point in putting *everything* within $(document).ready().. Just the initialization code
[11:33:37] <taplar> doesn't hurt anything though
[11:34:09] <taplar> it can actually be benifical if you are also using it as a namespace
[11:34:14] <thecliguy> Oh, what a fool. I see it doesn't have a return now.
[11:34:26] <thecliguy> thank you for spotting that
[11:35:24] <thecliguy> hah! It's working now.
[11:35:54] <thecliguy> thank you!
[11:42:58] <thecliguy> Is it possible to handle .done() and .fail() as a single call?
[11:43:15] <taplar> what do you mean?
[11:43:31] <thecliguy> Right now I've got 'getData().done(handleData)', but not sure how to adapt this to accomodate .fail
[11:43:53] <taplar> you'd want to treat a failure differently, no?
[11:44:16] <thecliguy> yeah, but I don't get how to do it syntactically.
[11:44:34] <thecliguy> How do I bolt on the '.fail( )' ?
[11:44:40] <taplar> getData().done(handleData).fail(handleFailure)
[11:44:42] <taplar> or
[11:44:51] <taplar> getData().then(handleData, handleFailure)
[11:46:45] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[11:47:06] <thecliguy> Ah, I didn't know you could bolt them together like '.done(handleData).fail(handleFailure)'.
[11:47:20] <thecliguy> than you.
[11:47:24] <thecliguy> *thank
[11:47:26] <taplar> sure.  you're providing callbacks for the promise/deferred object
[12:38:20] <taplar> mmm, bacon
[12:38:36] <robertmaxrees> oof
[13:07:42] <goodenough> can i modify a selector? i have a selector that i want to change to $selector.
[13:07:59] <taplar> can you elaborate?
[13:08:03] <goodenough> $selector.withClass('is-selected')
[13:08:08] <goodenough> something like that
[13:08:33] <taplar> are you wanting to find the elements that also have that class, or include other elements that have that class?
[13:09:29] <goodenough> <div class="block-item is-selected">
[13:09:43] <goodenough> $selector = $('block-item');
[13:09:52] <thykka> $('.block-item.is-selected') or $someCollection.filter('.is-selected')
[13:09:54] <taplar> $selector.filter('.is-selected')
[13:10:05] <taplar> will return the subset of elements that also have the is-selected class
[13:10:39] <goodenough> ok filter works
[13:23:54] <d[10]>  I'm trying to make a progress bar with ajax and laravel, except that the progress () function waits for the other request to finish to bring me the results (percents)
[13:25:01] <d[10]> https://gist.github.com/danillo10/da145ca51d04e039612dc31d5f58febe
[13:27:56] <taplar> are you saying /progress does not finish until /transmissao/salva finishes?
[13:28:40] <d[10]> taplar: can you help me ?
[13:28:57] <taplar> dunno.  i'm in the "asking questions" phase, :)
[13:29:32] <d[10]> taplar:  yeah i'm saying
[13:29:41] <d[10]> I guess
[13:29:42] <d[10]> ;X
[13:29:48] <taplar> ?
[13:30:03] <d[10]>  That's not what I wanted to do.
[13:30:15] <taplar> But are you saying that is what is happening?
[13:31:20] <d[10]> I'm just trying to get the backend session and show the percentage in progress bar
[13:31:26] <pavonia> Could be a server problem. What does /progress return if the POST request hasn't yet been transmitted completely?
[13:32:14] <taplar> Also how long does it take for /transmissao/salva to finish, average?
[13:32:55] <d[10]> Progress only returns after post
[13:33:16] <d[10]> taplar:  fast
[13:33:23] <taplar> how fast?
[13:33:29] <taplar> look at your network console.
[13:33:31] <d[10]> 2000
[13:33:59] <taplar> ok, so within that time, the interval would have ran twice
[13:34:20] <taplar> have you tried removing the interval and seeing what the progress does?
[13:34:37] <taplar> if it is, indeed, blocking then the interval doesn't make much sense in that case.
[13:35:35] <d[10]> testing
[13:35:37] <d[10]> wait
[13:40:42] <d[10]> taplar:  return 100 imediate
[13:40:46] <d[10]> progress
[13:40:57] <d[10]> without
[13:41:03] <d[10]> setInterval
[13:41:16] <taplar> so, you are calling the progress before you start your other ajax call
[13:41:22] <taplar> and it is returning 100%
[13:41:49] <taplar> and terminates the interval
[13:43:19] <taplar> so what happens if you call that method -after- you make the other ajax call?
[13:43:24] <d[10]> taplar:  what i do now ?
[13:45:44] <d[10]> taplar:
[13:45:54] <d[10]> he is waiting the post finish
[13:46:00] <taplar> ?
[13:46:38] <taplar> you just said it returned 100 immediately
[13:46:51] <robertmaxrees> schrodinger's bug
[13:47:09] <d[10]> taplar:  before post
[13:47:31] <taplar> and if you call it after, it doesn't finish until after the first finishes?
[13:49:13] <d[10]> taplar: no understand
[13:49:25] <d[10]> my english is bad
[13:49:29] <taplar> you are saying it waits on the post to finish
[13:49:37] <taplar> but not if you call it before the second ajax
[13:49:47] <taplar> in which case it finishes immediately with 100
[13:50:00] <taplar> the "it waits" statement doesn't make sense with the other two statements
[13:50:18] <taplar> so i'm trying to understand what you are seeing that makes you think it is waiting
[13:51:26] <d[10]> taplar: i'm not saying wait
[13:51:44] <taplar> <d[10]> he is waiting the post finish
[13:52:18] <taplar> then what does that ^ mean?
[13:52:41] <d[10]> taplar: I know, but I'm triggering an event to be checking a session and this event only runs when the other ends
[13:53:26] <taplar> The only "event" here is the submit event.  What are you calling "events"?
[13:53:41] <d[10]> taplar:  ah sorry
[13:53:46] <d[10]> i need call it
[13:54:41] <d[10]> taplar:
[13:54:42] <d[10]> then what does that ^ mean
[13:54:43] <d[10]> ops
[13:54:47] <d[10]> When I fire the event, it sends the requests, but there are no answers in those requests, when the post ends there I get the answers all at once
[13:55:18] <taplar> so open your network console, and find those two requests
[13:55:36] <taplar> or three, how ever many times those requests are executed
[13:55:50] <taplar> how long does it take for the progress request to finish?
[13:55:55] <d[10]> ok 1 minute
[13:56:19] <d[10]> taplar: i put sleep on backend
[13:56:23] <d[10]> to see it
[13:56:30] <taplar> ?
[13:56:35] <d[10]> sleep(3) sleep(4)
[13:56:41] <taplar> you put a sleep on the progress endpoint?
[13:56:48] <d[10]> my post finish in 10 seconds
[13:56:54] <d[10]> in back end
[13:56:55] <d[10]> php
[13:57:05] <taplar> how long does the progress request take?
[13:57:15] <d[10]> i will see now
[13:57:42] <taplar> also that may be a question for ##php.  I dunno how a sleep command will affect multiple rest calls coming in
[13:58:15] <taplar> I would *hope* they would be different threads
[13:59:23] <d[10]> taplar: no affect
[13:59:32] <taplar> ?
[13:59:37] <d[10]> i will read the session
[13:59:38] <d[10]> only it
[13:59:54] <d[10]> my progress read the session value
[13:59:58] <taplar> hold on. i'm trying to find out how long the progress request takes to complete
[13:59:59] <d[10]> have no problem with php
[14:00:29] <d[10]> taplar: i send 5 requests
[14:00:33] <d[10]> in 10 seconds
[14:00:43] <taplar> 5 progress requests?
[14:00:48] <d[10]> yes
[14:00:52] <d[10]> no responses
[14:01:07] <taplar> they never finished?
[14:01:15] <d[10]> i get responses after post finish
[14:01:27] <d[10]> response 100 to all requests
[14:01:32] <taplar> what's the duration on one of the progress requests?
[14:03:08] <d[10]> request set: 60us
[14:03:12] <d[10]> sent*
[14:03:23] <d[10]> waiting 7.73s
[14:03:32] <taplar> total time, just total time
[14:03:45] <taplar> for one progress request
[14:03:51] <d[10]> Queueing 1.13ms
[14:04:22] <d[10]> Explanation: 8.04s
[14:04:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:04:35] <taplar> i'm going to give up soon
[14:04:45] <robertmaxrees> d[10] don't ignore his question
[14:05:28] <d[10]> I do not know how to see this
[14:05:40] <robertmaxrees> the total request tume?
[14:05:44] <robertmaxrees> *time?
[14:06:27] <taplar> are you in chrome or firefox?
[14:06:56] <d[10]> chrome
[14:07:00] <d[10]> i'm on tab network
[14:07:01] <d[10]> timing
[14:07:52] <taplar> So you see the Name/Method/Status/Domain/Type/Initiator/Size/Time/Waterfall columns?
[14:10:31] <d[10]> taplar:  time no
[14:12:02] <taplar> ok, if you don't see it, right click on one of the columns
[14:12:21] <taplar> you should see a selection of columns show up.  make sure "Time" is checked
[14:13:22] <d[10]> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37699677/see-request-time-in-chrome-developer-tools
[14:13:33] <d[10]> here no have that toolbar
[14:13:39] <d[10]> Name/Method/Status/Domain/Type/Initiator/Size/Time/Waterfall
[14:13:46] <d[10]> taplar:  ok
[14:14:18] <taplar> you don't see any of those columns?
[14:14:52] <d[10]> no
[14:14:59] <d[10]> i'm searching here
[14:15:05] <d[10]> one method so show up
[14:15:46] <taplar> do you have firefox on your machine?
[14:17:07] <d[10]> yeah
[14:17:19] <d[10]> i'm try in firefox
[14:17:20] <taplar> can you try this same thing on firefox and see if you can get the request time?
[14:22:13] <d[10]> taplar: no time columns
[14:22:24] <d[10]> i have Method Status
[14:22:25] <d[10]> size
[14:22:27] <d[10]> type
[14:22:39] <d[10]> domain, file
[14:22:47] <taplar> Right click on one of those, go down to Timings, select Response time
[14:22:49] <d[10]> transferred
[14:24:16] <d[10]> start first request
[14:24:21] <d[10]> 1,44s
[14:24:29] <d[10]> end time 9,65s
[14:24:42] <taplar> what is the response time on one of the progress requests?
[14:24:44] <d[10]> Duration 9,53s
[14:25:00] <d[10]> Reponse time 9,51
[14:25:08] <d[10]> Reponse time 9,51s
[14:25:09] <taplar> and what is the response time on the post request?
[14:25:22] <d[10]> ops
[14:25:27] <d[10]> 9,51 is the post
[14:25:39] <d[10]> 9,65 progress
[14:25:56] <taplar> ok
[14:26:09] <taplar> so most likely one of two things is going on
[14:26:27] <taplar> actually just one
[14:26:42] <taplar> your server is doing something that is keeping the progress request from finishing before the other finishes
[14:27:08] <taplar> i was going to say you could have async set to false globally, but that would cause the post not to start until the get finished
[14:27:19] <taplar> but that doesn't appear to be the case
[14:27:49] <taplar> so you need to figure out why your server is doing that
[14:29:57] <d[10]> taplar: hum
[14:30:36] <d[10]> taplar:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6903318/multiple-ajax-requests-delay-each-other?rq=1
[14:30:43] <d[10]> is that solution then
[14:34:05] <taplar> dunno.  I haven't messed with much PHP in a long time
[14:36:42] <d[10]> taplar:  http://konrness.com/php5/how-to-prevent-blocking-php-requests/
[14:36:59] <d[10]> taplar:
[14:37:01] <d[10]> but
[14:37:07] <d[10]> thanks to the time
[14:37:10] <d[10]> i'm sorry!
[14:37:30] <taplar> no problem man
[15:14:52] <TikityTik> How can I make this work? $(this):parent
[15:15:12] <taplar> $(this).parent()  or this.parentNode
[15:16:28] <TikityTik> ahhhh
[15:16:48] <TikityTik> unfortunately this looks convoluted:  $(this).parent().parent().find('.dropdown-menu').stop(true, true).delay(100).fadeOut(500);
[15:17:12] <taplar> what kind of element is the parent parent?
[15:17:26] <taplar> & does it have any sort of id or class on it?
[15:19:53] <d[10]> taplar:  its that solution https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/broadcasting
[15:20:56] <taplar> i'll have to check it out in a bit.  my net is being stupid again and i'm in the middle of a long running query.  but if you got it working, awesome, :)
[15:21:25] <TikityTik> taplar, it does from bootstrap, but I only want that specific dropdown for that class to popup
[15:22:02] <TikityTik> also the first wrapper is interfering with overflow: hidden
[15:22:06] <TikityTik> first parent*
[15:22:07] <taplar> TikityTik: sure.  I was just going to suggest that if the parent parent had an id/class identifier that you could key off of, you could do $(this).closest('thatidentifier').find('.dropdown-menu')
[15:22:20] <TikityTik> ahhh
[15:22:30] <TikityTik> taplar, isn't that more overhead?
[15:23:01] <taplar> maybe.  it does have to perform an evaluation.  but it is also slightly more readable
[15:23:22] <taplar> though it is also more flexible, should your markup change
[15:28:56] <taplar> hasta luego!
[16:10:07] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[16:24:12] <thecliguy> When the checkbox is checked in this sample code: https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/696477/ it produces the following error to occur in the console: "TypeError: getData(...) is undefined".
[16:25:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing an error.
[16:25:47] <thecliguy> sorry - i realise i did not exaplain fully the steps...
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> you mean when it's checked and you press the button?
[16:26:12] <thecliguy> ...if you check the checkbox then press the button, then press f12 and examine your console you should see the error.
[16:26:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:26:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:26:34] <robertmaxrees> because you'
[16:26:42] <robertmaxrees> *you're returning nothing in that case.
[16:26:52] <thecliguy> whats the correct thing to do in that situation?
[16:27:11] <robertmaxrees> there are a few considerations.
[16:27:46] <robertmaxrees> imo your if ($("#checkme").is(':checked')) { check should happen in the event handler, not in if ($("#checkme").is(':checked')) {
[16:28:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eukf0yq9/ something like this./
[16:29:55] <thecliguy> OK, so check the state of the checkbox in the buttons click event.
[16:30:08] <robertmaxrees> that's one wya.
[16:30:10] <robertmaxrees> *way
[16:30:47] <robertmaxrees> the reason you're getting that error in your original case is because you're returning undefined and not a deferred.
[16:34:56] <thecliguy> What would be the appropriate return type if I just want to abort the function?
[16:35:33] <robertmaxrees> notice that part where i said "you're returning undefined and not a deferred."?
[16:36:49] <thecliguy> yes
[16:37:21] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[16:37:22] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:37:25] <thecliguy> I understand the principle but I'm not sure how to put that into practice.
[16:37:55] <thecliguy> I need to return something to satisfy the expectation of a deferred but I'm not quite sure how to go about that.
[16:42:38] <robertmaxrees> honestly
[16:42:47] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't call getData at all partially because of this.
[16:43:39] <thecliguy> So better to have an initial wrapper function which checks the checkbox state and then calls getData.
[16:43:55] <robertmaxrees> i mean, that's what the handler is for.
[16:44:57] <thecliguy> Yeah, this check actually needs to be performed in a few places, so rather than repeat the code for checking the checkbox state over and over, I'll stick that into a function and have that call getData.
[16:45:07] <thecliguy> I think that's the way to go... what do you think?
[16:45:11] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:45:14] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[16:46:40] <robertmaxrees> though i'd wonder why the button is available to click at all in that case :)
[16:48:42] <thecliguy> To be honest, this is a rather contrived example - it just simply demonstrates the principle of my actual code without having to dump a huge script into jsfiddle.
[16:48:49] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:29:00] <gambl0re> hello?
[17:45:01] <rocketmagnet> hi folks
[17:45:12] <robertbusy> hello

[17:46:22] <rocketmagnet> i've included jquery-ui.js in the header
[17:47:03] <rocketmagnet> i found no other include files
[17:47:47] <robertmaxrees> have you included jquery as well.
[17:47:50] <robertmaxrees> and what about the css?
[17:52:57] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[18:07:49] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:11:06] <rocketmagnet> all there, do i need more than jquery-ui.js and jquery ? and is the order important ?
