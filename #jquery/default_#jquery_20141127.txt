[00:00:49] <reynierpm> hi, I need to send to a $.post request the id of each span contained inside parMarcaModeloFabricanteBody on this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/hrbt7cbj/
[00:00:53] <reynierpm> how I can do that?
[00:06:15] <Cork> <_<'
[00:06:26] <Cork> ya, sorry for not answering the question in 3 minutes...
[00:20:01] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[00:21:34] <philip__b> morning gurke
[00:21:44] <gurke_> hi philip__b
[00:22:05] <philip__b> have you already written some selectors this morning? :D
[00:31:22] <Paradisee> hello everyone o/
[00:31:47] <Paradisee> can someone provide me an example of a dialog box in jquery? i can't see the example on jquery ui :/
[00:32:37] <Paradisee> i need to make kind of dialog with some inputs, to change dinamically my json
[00:33:03] <Cork> Paradisee: works just fine here http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/dialog/default.html
[00:33:08] <Cork> why can't you see them?
[00:33:18] <Paradisee> no idea :/
[00:33:33] <Paradisee> which system are you running actually?
[00:33:34] <Cork> make sure you don't block the scripts
[00:34:16] <Paradisee> can't even load that page you just pasted :/
[00:34:28] <Paradisee> fine, i can see it
[00:34:36] <Kartagis> how is codepen different from jsfiddle?
[00:34:47] <Paradisee> thanks Cork
[00:34:54] <Cork> Kartagis: now days, not much
[00:35:05] <Cork> jsfiddle used to provide a raw access to the paste
[00:35:08] <Cork> but they've removed that
[00:36:27] <Cork> Kartagis: the only difference i can tell now days is that codepen doesn't provide any help for third party libs
[00:36:35] <Cork> and is over all a bit heavier to run
[00:37:14] <Kartagis> Cork: so you have to manually src them?
[00:37:18] <Paradisee> Cork: http://www.twitch.tv/paradisee89/
[00:37:26] <Cork> Kartagis: yes
[00:37:41] <Kartagis> that should be fub
[00:37:44] <Kartagis> fun*
[00:38:52] <Kartagis> Paradisee: is this live?
[00:38:55] <Paradisee> ya
[00:39:01] <Kartagis> cool
[00:44:38] <Paradisee> where are all the option info?
[00:44:53] <Paradisee> found
[00:53:54] <Koopz> $.get().fail() <- does the fail catch 40Xs?
[00:54:50] <Koopz> apparently...
[00:55:28] <Koopz> aaaight
[01:24:52] <HumbugRumdug> Greetings, I need to give current page: http://gustav.be/debondt/#entry-1 infinite looping. Atm when you reach the last image it just sends you back to the start. I was thinking of duplicating the first image after the last one and scrolling right only to set the scrollposition to 0 once the animation is complete. No clue how to however.
[01:49:38] <callumacrae> Heya, does anyone know a gallery that will let me do stuff like this? http://i.imgur.com/4ghvpj4.jpg
[01:53:58] <HumbugRumdug> callumacrae: Isotope, Megafolio, Magicwall, Masonry, Shuffle.js, Jquery Shapeshift, Gridster.js, Jquery Flex
[01:54:42] <HumbugRumdug> Just google responsive image grid and you'll get tons more
[01:55:24] <callumacrae> for some reason google isnt working for me, so I was reduced to bing and couldn't find anything
[01:55:27] <callumacrae> thanks!
[02:33:04] <emx> why is the use of ajaxSetup() not recommended?
[03:07:45] <hanmac1> hey i does wonder, i have problems with a site that it does some AJAX and for (me) unknown reason it does scroll around but i cant explain that to me ... is there a way to scroll the page to a given position so i can compensate that?
[03:13:34] <suspicious_eel> hanmac1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.scrollTo
[03:13:42] <hekep> hi what has happened to crossSelect plugin ?
[03:13:53] <suspicious_eel> it would make more sense to find out what causes the scroll, though
[03:44:40] <hmsimha> Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to make the user interact with discrete full-viewport displays in a website by scrolling fully from one to the next when the user scrolls down
[03:44:52] <hmsimha> is there a library to handle this?
[03:45:20] <hmsimha> for desktop, not just mobile
[04:20:49] <Paradisee> is it possible to make a <button> draggable?
[04:22:47] <thyphus> Paradisee: why you dont just google for it? "jquery draggable button", first hit
[04:22:48] <thyphus> -.-
[04:23:19] <Uhkis> ?g jquery draggable button
[04:23:21] <b-ot> Uhkis: buttons can't made draggables by jQuery UI draggable() - Stack ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18035651/buttons-cant-made-draggables-by-jquery-ui-draggable
[04:30:29] <Bogdaniel> hello everyone, I have a div from where I use appendTo to show some data from MySQL the problem is that when I choose to show something else.. it shows the old data
[04:31:19] <Cork> Bogdaniel: you most likely want to use .html() instead
[04:31:22] <garethdaine> Gogdaniel: It will
[04:31:28] <Cork> it will replace what was in there
[04:31:43] <garethdaine> Sorry Bogdaniel. As Cork says you want .html()
[04:31:50] <garethdaine> That will replace the old HTML
[04:31:59] <garethdaine> So .html(data)
[04:32:02] <Cork> well old elements not html, but ya
[04:32:08] <Paradisee> thyphus: did you read the comments?
[04:32:26] <garethdaine> Cork: It will replace the HTML in the selected element
[04:32:39] <Cork> garethdaine: no it won't cause the dom don't use html
[04:32:39] <garethdaine> Hence .html
[04:32:42] <Cork> it uses html
[04:32:44] <thyphus> Paradisee: is it my problem?
[04:32:46] <Cork> ...
[04:32:51] <Cork> it uses elements, parsed from html
[04:33:03] <Paradisee> thyphus: just don't talk if you doesnt have an answer
[04:33:11] <garethdaine> Cork: Sure, but what is rendered is HTML no?
[04:33:17] <Cork> no
[04:33:18] <thyphus> Paradisee: if you got a problem first google for it and then state a real question
[04:33:22] <Cork> what is rendered is the dom
[04:33:28] <thyphus> Paradisee: maybe i got the answer?
[04:33:42] <garethdaine> Sure, which contains HTML elements no?
[04:34:16] <Cork> with emphasis on elements yes
[04:34:34] <garethdaine> Either way, it’s still HTML ;-P
[04:34:39] <thyphus> Paradisee: and if you ment the events, well then... where is that in your question ffs?
[04:34:41] <Cork> no it isn't
[04:34:46] <Bogdaniel> using .htm it doesn't show anything
[04:34:50] <thyphus> *sigh*
[04:35:03] <garethdaine> Bogdaniel: Let’s see the code
[04:35:10] <Cork> garethdaine: html is tag text structure, elements is a tree like instance chain
[04:35:10] <garethdaine> and it’s .html()
[04:35:11] <Bogdaniel> http://pastebin.com/thxbAyne
[04:35:16] <Bogdaniel> maybe i'm doing something wrong I dunno
[04:35:50] <Cork> Bogdaniel: the other way around
[04:35:58] <Cork> you give the new html to the .html() function
[04:35:58] <garethdaine> .html('.carousel-inner'); should be switched
[04:36:02] <Cork> with the target on the left
[04:36:07] <garethdaine> Yup
[04:38:56] <garethdaine> Anyway, anyone interested in seeing an interactive advent calendar I’ve just made with Laravel and jQuery/JavaScript?
[04:39:02] <garethdaine> http://cream.local:8000/advent-calendar
[04:39:10] <garethdaine> Damn, that’s local lol
[04:39:15] <garethdaine> https://purplegriffon.com/advent-calendar
[04:39:16] <Bogdaniel> :-)
[04:39:38] <Bogdaniel> is it open source ? :-)
[04:40:05] <garethdaine> There’s code which will be switched on when it’s live to stop people opening future dates or entering draws for previous ones
[04:40:14] <garethdaine> No, it’s for work mate so not open source
[04:41:06] <Uhkis> well the js-side is ;-)
[04:41:14] <garethdaine> Sure
[04:41:16] <garethdaine> lol
[04:41:25] <Cork> Uhkis: the source is readable but not open
[04:41:47] <garethdaine> Exactly, in terms of licensing but it’s pretty straightforward stuff anyway
[04:41:56] <Uhkis> Cork: i think you mean free
[04:42:17] <Cork> Uhkis: no, unlicensed code means it is proprtiatary to the one writing it
[04:42:28] <Cork> Uhkis: open means you are free to use it
[04:42:34] <Cork> and free means you have to contribude back
[04:42:36] <garethdaine> Yup
[04:43:40] <Cork> so grabbing random snippets of code from random site and use it on yours could techincally get you in trouble
[04:43:55] <Cork> if the author want to pursue it
[04:43:58] <jikuja> hmmm
[04:44:02] <Cork> even if said place is github
[04:44:26] <jikuja> or SO
[04:44:31] <Cork> ya
[04:44:49] <Cork> unless they set a cm or om licens
[04:44:56] <Cork> (or mit or...)
[04:45:25] <jikuja> I still does not know how to use code from SO if I want to add it in MIT/BSD/whatever licenced project
[04:45:53] <Bogdaniel> garethdaine well congrats looks good and it's nice I love it :-)
[04:45:59] <Cork> jikuja: you would have to contact the one posting on so and ask if they are ok with releasing it under said license
[04:46:11] <Cork> and make sure they actually authored it
[04:46:23] <jikuja> ':P
[04:46:31] <Cork> (and i'm not joking)
[04:48:13] <garethdaine> Thanks Bogdaniel
[04:49:10] <Uhkis> garethdaine: now just fix the random appearing scrollbar and the flashing calendar after closing modal
[04:49:48] <Bogdaniel> Cork http://pastebin.com/EB8z5VyV like that ? :D
[04:50:09] <Cork> Bogdaniel: yup
[04:50:52] <garethdaine> Uhkis: Yeah, working on that now. Bloody annoying. It’s the snow
[04:51:09] <garethdaine> I also need to work out want I want to do on mobiles with the background
[04:51:16] <Cork> you could convert '<li data-target="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide-to="'+ k +'"></li>' to $('<li>', { 'data-target': '#carousel-example-generic', 'data-slide-to': k }')
[04:51:18] <Cork> if you like
[04:51:26] <Cork> might make the code more readable
[04:51:40] <Cork> (and a bit safer as you remove the risk of xss)
[04:51:51] <jikuja> Cork: yeah. CC BY-SA 3.0's shareAlike makes reuse of the code snippets really hard. And in worst case those code snippets really are borrowed from somewhere else.
[04:51:54] <Cork> opps typo
[04:52:05] <Cork> * $('<li>', { 'data-target': '#carousel-example-generic', 'data-slide-to': k })
[04:52:06] <garethdaine> Also Bogdaniel. I’m not a big fan of having HTML in my JS like that. I tend to create specific HTML partials pull them in via the AJAX request
[04:52:54] <Cork> jikuja: ya
[04:53:17] <Bogdaniel> garethdaine i have a modal window to show a carousel with some images and some details for a set of products
[04:53:19] <Cork> garethdaine: pulling every small element over ajax will make things slow though
[04:53:31] <Bogdaniel> and i didn't know another way of doing it so far :D
[04:53:48] <Bogdaniel> what Cork just told me to do is like chess for me :)) when it comes to jquery
[04:54:15] <Cork> Bogdaniel: it is basically short for document.createElement('li')
[04:54:26] <Cork> and then setting the different attributes on that new element
[04:54:28] <garethdaine> Cork, if you have a lot
[04:54:49] <Bogdaniel> i see
[04:54:54] <Cork> garethdaine: sure when you have lots > 1-2 you should at least move it inside the html
[04:55:11] <Cork> but when it is single elements it is arguable to use it
[04:55:29] <Cork> but i prefer to use the $('<elm>', {}) structure then
[04:55:41] <garethdaine> Things like the .each function could also probably be handled in a partial based on the data passed
[04:56:00] <Cork> bigger chungs i just put in a <script type="text/template"></script> or just as hidden elements
[04:56:44] <garethdaine> That said I am a relative JS newb really
[04:56:59] <garethdaine> Well I think so, only just getting in to OOP
[04:57:15] <garethdaine> On the JS side that is
[04:57:26] <mjz13> hello all, how can i hide() all images on website with src="/"? im using this jQuery("body").find('img.introobrazok').attr('src'); but its only returning first image in DOM
[04:57:28] <garethdaine> I do love it though
[04:57:55] <Cork> mjz13: they only contain / or start with?
[04:58:03] <mjz13> Cork only contain /
[04:58:21] <Cork> $('img[src="/"].introobrazok').hide()
[04:58:52] <Bogdaniel> Cork http://pastebin.com/buT8ezX7 , but i noticed i have a problem. on all products it shows only a single picture and it's the same everywhere
[04:59:22] <Cork> ugg
[04:59:27] <Cork> right when you're saying it
[04:59:31] <Cork> your running it in a loop
[04:59:32] <Cork> >_<'
[04:59:35] <Cork> sorry
[04:59:59] <Cork> Bogdaniel: you want to build an array of the new elements
[05:00:05] <Cork> and run .html once after the loop
[05:00:17] <Cork> Bogdaniel: else you will cause a lot of reflows and make things really slow
[05:01:01] <mjz13> Cork thx :)
[05:01:20] <Bogdaniel> Cork i see
[05:01:38] <Cork> mjz13: np
[05:02:03] <theshit123> hi, can i search for an object in an array and take his index in the array?, i was trying to use $.grep but i think i can not with it, maybe other function http://pastebin.com/5fAY8MjS
[05:02:19] <_rgn> why do you need the index
[05:02:46] <theshit123> for change the object in the array
[05:03:14] <_rgn> you just need the object reference for that
[05:03:51] <Cork> unless he wants to replace the object
[05:04:32] <Cork> theshit123: best option is to $.each loop the array and grab the index from there (and return false when you find it to stop the loop)
[05:05:02] <theshit123> ok, i will for that then
[05:07:21] <Bogdaniel> Cork http://pastebin.com/GjzuV6WN seems to work
[05:07:51] <Bogdaniel> garethdaine my girlfriend says congrats for your little project is lovely and gave me some ideas what someone could do with that script of yours hahah :D
[05:08:22] <garethdaine> Haha :-) Thanks
[05:08:43] <Cork> Bogdaniel: don't store the element you generate with the $('<li>', { 'data-target': '#carousel-example-generic', 'data-slide-to': k }); line
[05:08:55] <Cork> so it isn't used
[05:09:53] <Cork> Bogdaniel: also please use jsfiddle.net instead of pastebin
[05:09:54] <Bogdaniel> ahh what do you mean by don't store it ?
[05:09:59] <Cork> makes helping you much simpler
[05:10:05] <Bogdaniel> :-)
[05:10:31] <Bogdaniel> if you want i could upload the files somewhere.. would take some time to check out the live version (which is not finished ) :))
[05:11:09] <Cork> Bogdaniel: also you don't store JSON.stringify(data);
[05:11:17] <Cork> so that line doesn't do anything
[05:12:07] <Bogdaniel> i see
[05:13:15] <Bogdaniel> Cork that  line you told me about how can i use it ? because i don't quite understand the way it works .. and i dunno exactly how to use it
[05:13:42] <Cork> Bogdaniel: http://jsfiddle.net/c6j0o0xs/
[05:13:59] <Cork> i would convert like 18 to not concat variables too
[05:14:12] <Cork> ... and not have the duplicate code -_-'
[05:14:22] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/c6j0o0xs/1/
[05:15:46] <Cork> Bogdaniel: but it depends on how much you trust the source you get the data from
[05:17:02] <Bogdaniel> Cork I've read the code and now i got it how it can be used and the nice thing is that you can do this shorthand thing for most of the stuff when it comes to html :-) which really helps because i can't read the code better instead of a bunch of divs and stuff
[05:17:03] <Bogdaniel> :-)
[05:18:03] <Cork> Bogdaniel: ya, the details section is really pushing it in what is ok to have in the js
[05:18:19] <Cork> Bogdaniel: and you should possibly think about moving it to a template instead
[05:19:22] <Bogdaniel> and by template you mean ?
[05:20:17] <Unopoo> how to make jqueryui's slider move to next point smoothly?
[05:20:57] <cfooo> Hello guys, im trying to put a selectbox in my handsontable, but the options is not clickable. Anyone that know what can be overlapping? Tried with z-index but it didnt work. Maybe someone has had a similar problem here? http://jsfiddle.net/ekvsU/7/
[05:22:06] <cfooo> sorry the link was not updated; http://jsfiddle.net/ekvsU/87/
[05:22:55] <Cork> Bogdaniel: http://jsfiddle.net/c6j0o0xs/3/
[05:23:43] <Cork> though you prob want to store the text from the template in a variable before the loop
[05:24:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/c6j0o0xs/4/
[05:37:24] <Bogdaniel> Cork i see interesting i will have to check it out a little bit more :-) didn't know about this :D
[05:37:54] <Cork> Bogdaniel: it is a bit of a hack (in that browser doesn't explicitly support the template type
[05:38:11] <Bogdaniel> i see
[05:38:11] <Cork> Bogdaniel: but they are standardizing this as <template> in future browsers
[05:38:18] <Bogdaniel> :-)
[05:38:22] <Cork> ?mdn template html
[05:38:23] <b-ot> Cork: template - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[05:38:29] <Bogdaniel> it's time they should make things easier
[05:38:45] <Cork> they are do quite a lot of nice things
[05:38:55] <Cork> the csswg group is hard at work too
[05:41:26] <Bogdaniel> i find it difficult to work with data from ajax... since i'm so used to send data from php :D
[05:41:44] <Bogdaniel> would be nice if they would make it somehow more easier to access data :-)
[05:44:10] <Cork> Bogdaniel: what part is hard?
[05:44:23] <Cork> deferred solve most of the problems
[05:46:59] <arnoud> Is there a method that can travel down the DOM tree?  I found .closest() but travels up.
[05:47:22] <Cork> arnoud: .find
[05:47:47] <arnoud> K tnx Cork
[05:49:36] <Kartagis> speaking of which, I never understook why in some lessons in http://try.jquery.com they used .closest() then .find()
[05:50:03] <Cork> Kartagis: .closest searches through the parent chain
[05:50:21] <Cork> and when they found the parent they want they search for a grand child of it with .find
[05:51:38] <Kartagis> Cork: can't they just search for it?
[05:51:57] <Cork> Kartagis: that is what the do
[05:52:24] <Kartagis> Cork: I mean is .closest() a must here?
[05:52:48] <Cork> Kartagis: if you run $(this).find() it will look for children of the current element
[05:53:15] <Cork> Kartagis: example http://jsfiddle.net/drkLes7b/1/
[05:58:06] <arnoud> Find worked for me clicked on a parent element and wanted to find the value for a child: $(this).find('use').attr('xlink:href');
[06:00:05] <arnoud> Cork nice show case on your fiddle to  travel up via closest and than find :)
[06:00:44] <Cork> well the example it self isn't very useful, but it should explain where they different functions has it's use
[06:00:54] <Cork> *where the different
[06:01:19] <arnoud> clear to me tnx
[06:08:59] <bacobart> hi. when i do this in ff/chrome/ie $('<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>'); the alert gets executed. is that supposed to happen?
[06:09:21] <Cork> bacobart: yes
[06:09:32] <bacobart> okay. why exactly?
[06:09:40] <bacobart> i'm struggling to understand why a selector should execute js
[06:09:48] <Cork> cause it triggers the fetch of the src img
[06:09:55] <Cork> and as x doesn't resolve you get an error
[06:10:23] <Cork> (also don't use event attributes)
[06:10:34] <bacobart> no i know its a xss test case
[06:12:04] <Bogdaniel> Cork i forgot to say thank  you very much for your help i really appreciate it now i can finish the website i'm making for a friend faster :-) and i learnt new things when it comes to jquery
[06:12:05] <Bogdaniel> :-)
[06:12:14] <Bogdaniel> many thanks for taking time with a jquery newbie
[06:12:22] <Cork> Bogdaniel: yw
[06:12:44] <bacobart> still, the $('') syntax is short for just selecting an element right?
[06:12:56] <Cork> no
[06:12:56] <bacobart> so why would jquery actually try to download the image, and execute the onerror?
[06:13:09] <bacobart> oh
[06:13:12] <bacobart> what am i missing?:P
[06:13:14] <Cork> $('<.*>') is short for document.createFragment
[06:13:19] <bacobart> ah.
[06:13:23] <bacobart> that explains
[06:13:43] <Cork> well not really
[06:14:00] <Cork> but $() has a lot of magic it tests and tries when you give it a string
[06:14:21] <bacobart> i see
[06:14:24] <bacobart> that explains a lot, thansk
[06:14:26] <bacobart> thanks
[06:17:38] <bacobart> Cork, do you happen to know a page with some documentation on what the shorthand $() all tries to do?
[06:17:49] <Cork> api.jquery.com
[06:18:13] <Cork> bacobart: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[06:18:29] <Cork> as you see $ is quite magical
[06:18:47] <bacobart> yeah
[06:18:50] <bacobart> thanks again :)
[06:55:07] <JackBauer24> jQuery UI Sortable question - is it possible to serialize list with common order for different key names (li elements with id like type1_id, type2_id). Currently both type1 and type2 have its own order starting from 0, I'd like them to have common order values, but pass them in seperated URL variables.
[06:58:25] <JackBauer24> nvm, I've realized it's pretty stupid idea, I'll take a different approach
[07:03:06] * CssNoob good evening y'all
[07:34:14] <arnoud> Does jquery have a: nth-child(2) selector like CSS? I want to select the second element of a match under filters I found: .first() but I want to get the second match.

[07:58:02] <reynierpm> hi and moorning, I need to find whether a TD element has or not text, I am doing this http://jsbin.com/rijiwamedo/1/edit?html,js,console but do not know where to go from there, can any give me some push?
[07:59:22] <reynierpm> the idea is to set boolVar to true if all the TD has text otherwise it will became false
[07:59:23] <reynierpm> any?
[08:20:02] <mitzev_> whats the best way to sort tables on my page via js?
[08:20:54] <mitzev_> i need to retrieve each tables <td> contents and compare them and sort based on sorting criteria
[08:38:13] <mitzev_> hiiiii
[08:38:26] <PeterPorka> good evening how to detect safari 5 with jquery.reject this is my code: http://pastebin.com/b5UD0KnD, it works great with ie 7+8
[08:39:10] <callumacrae> Why would you want to detect safari 5?
[08:39:15] <callumacrae> You're doing it wrong
[08:40:44] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: I'd just use a plugin.
[08:40:59] <BillCriswell> datatables or something will make that a lot easier.
[08:41:14] <mitzev_> BillCriswell, experimenting now :>
[08:42:12] <PeterPorka> what i am doing wrong?
[08:52:36] <PeterPorka> callumacrae: what is wrong?
[09:07:54] <OnceMe> I have small problem, I have box and inside text and vote up, so on hover of whole box, I show comments instant/display:block; which was set to hide; on default, however when I vote up, that function triggers for whole box too and shows comment instant, how to fix>
[09:09:32] <OnceMe> ??
[09:09:33] <OnceMe> ??????
[09:14:32] <Oka> Make a test case we can look at
[09:18:23] <OnceMe> Oka http://jsfiddle.net/6d4xgb8x/
[09:19:14] <Oka> http://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[09:19:21] <Oka> Probably what you want
[09:19:25] <BillCriswell> Hmm... I think jQuery UI switched something up on me.
[09:19:40] <Oka> Though if you want help debugging code, you should probably include the code.
[09:19:44] <OnceMe> ok you rock
[09:20:30] <OnceMe> hmm it does not work
[09:20:43] <OnceMe> should I maybe implement that in upvote function, instead of comment box.
[09:21:49] <OnceMe> Oka?
[09:21:50] <Oka> In the upvote.
[09:21:56] <OnceMe> eh thats the issue
[09:22:00] <OnceMe> I have link inside box too
[09:22:10] <OnceMe> so when I click on link, it wont be taken to location
[09:22:14] <OnceMe> instead it wil be shows comments
[09:22:17] <OnceMe> I need a way around>
[09:23:42] <OnceMe> I use delegate
[09:23:45] <OnceMe> in the click function
[09:24:43] <OnceMe> Oka?
[09:25:13] <Oka> Paste a larger snippet, include the JS that isn't working, and the styles that form the box
[09:27:43] <OnceMe> I cant
[09:27:45] <OnceMe> its very heavy
[09:29:46] <Oka> :\
[09:30:40] <OnceMe> I tried if(e.target != this) return;
[09:30:42] <OnceMe> not works either
[09:32:57] <Moonspell> hello all
[09:34:22] <BillCriswell> Any of you know why the jQuery UI option revert would return the droppable element as its first argument instead of a boolean for if it's in a valid droppable or not?
[09:34:43] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/6d4xgb8x/ works perfectly
[09:35:15] <doug64k> 3 divs in a div, parses some comments. success!
[09:38:55] <doug64k> BillCriswell: it is returning this so you can chain isn't it?
[09:40:13] <BillCriswell> doug64k: It's not chainable. It's just the jQuery UI option. http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-revert
[09:40:16] <doug64k> ah but the docs say it returns Boolean or String or Function
[09:40:51] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it does not document the arguments for the callback, but I could have sworn it returned a true/false for if it was in a valid droppable before.
[09:40:56] <doug64k> it is a getter
[09:41:55] <doug64k> it says the function must return true to revert the element
[09:44:08] <BillCriswell> doug64k: Yes, but it has the undocumented thing going on where the value passed to it was true or false which would tell you if it was in a valid droppable though.
[09:44:36] <BillCriswell> You used to be able to do say: { revert: function (valid) { return !valid; }}
[09:44:39] <doug64k> oh you can cheat and not have a droppable?
[09:45:14] <BillCriswell> I guess you techincally could... well, used to be able to at least.
[09:45:25] <BillCriswell> let me see what I did differently in the past haha
[09:45:34] <doug64k> you have draggable things and droppable things right?
[09:45:54] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:46:04] <doug64k> if you are giving a UI to let the user set the order of something sortable is easier
[09:46:20] <BillCriswell> I am not.
[09:46:52] <BillCriswell> doug64k: http://crswll.com/drag2/
[09:47:03] <BillCriswell> and take a look at http://crswll.com/drag2/js/app.js
[09:48:20] <BillCriswell> Ok, now I really feel nuts.
[09:48:57] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/hz7thgkk/1/ I'm trying to put this UI into Vue and something seems to be happening with the revert callback. So weird.
[09:50:45] <BillCriswell> Nevermind. I'm a dumbass.
[09:50:55] <doug64k> it's still downloading the first screenful of imagesfor me
[09:51:00] <doug64k> what size are they?
[09:51:01] <BillCriswell> doug64k: lol.
[09:51:08] <BillCriswell> Pretty huge. It was just a demo.
[09:51:12] <BillCriswell> No need to worry thought I figure it out.
[09:51:27] <doug64k> it will demonstrate how i hangs the browser if the machine isnt powerful
[09:51:31] <doug64k> it*
[09:51:46] <doug64k> just making sure you know
[09:52:08] <BillCriswell> doug64k: Yeah, it's going to be a kiosk running from localhost and the images will be sizes properly.
[09:52:10] <BillCriswell> sized*
[09:52:17] <doug64k> I am on a laptop with 4gb and it was just starting to swap thrash
[09:52:44] <doug64k> cool
[09:53:14] <BillCriswell> doug64k: Really? On my macbook pro with the same it works well.
[09:53:42] <doug64k> from LAN? or from the internet
[09:53:59] <BillCriswell> I loaded it from the internet fine. The images were a little slow but that's aboutit.
[09:54:29] <doug64k> well, being a magical apple product won't account for one scanline per second appearing on each image
[09:54:51] <BillCriswell> Can you drag the elements?
[09:55:16] <BillCriswell> and are you in Chrome or something else?
[09:55:20] <BillCriswell> Just wondering what could cause that.
[09:55:37] <doug64k> mutating the [[Prototype]] of an object will cause your code to run very slowly; instead create the object with the correct initial [[Prototype]] value using Object.create
[09:55:57] <doug64k> scary warning from FF there
[09:56:02] <doug64k> from vue.js
[09:56:12] <doug64k> "very" slowly
[09:56:27] <BillCriswell> Oh I tought you were talking about the crswll.com/drag2 link
[09:56:29] <doug64k> which browser BillCriswell
[09:56:38] <doug64k> I was earlier
[09:56:40] <doug64k> sorry
[09:56:43] <BillCriswell> Haha ok.
[09:56:54] <BillCriswell> doug64k: http://jsfiddle.net/hz7thgkk/2/ how about with this update?
[09:58:09] <quix> Hello. Are Bootstrap script-related questions answered here?
[09:58:40] <quix> More specifically about affix.js
[09:58:53] <doug64k> BillCriswell: I think you are expected to handle dragdrop event on the droppable
[09:59:18] <doug64k> BillCriswell: I've never cheated like that with the isValid. is that in the docs?
[09:59:35] <BillCriswell> doug64k: It's not.
[09:59:44] <BillCriswell> It returns false or the droppable, which confused me a bit.
[10:00:01] <BillCriswell> I was expecting a boolean.
[10:00:07] <doug64k> it's truthy
[10:00:17] <doug64k> a truthy*
[10:00:49] <doug64k> !!isValid would always be boolean
[10:00:55] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I was assigning vm.dropped = isValid; and that was really messing with things haha
[10:01:06] <BillCriswell> doug64k: Yeah, good point. Could just use that.
[10:02:23] <BillCriswell> I was just expecting the boolean, confused me quite a bit.
[10:10:10] <BillCriswell> Thanks for the extra set of eyes doug64k!
[10:10:22] <doug64k> np
[10:17:00] <doug64k> jsfiddle kills my laptop now
[10:17:29] <doug64k> I just spend a few minutes switching to another virtual terminal to kill the firefox process
[10:17:59] <doug64k> my machine was swamped so bad by codemirror.js on jsfiddle, that the login from text mode virtual terminal timed out the first time
[10:18:06] <doug64k> the linux scheduler is a joke
[10:19:12] <doug64k> you can swamp the cpu so badly with a browser that you can lock the user out of controlling their machine
[10:46:08] <mAxX--> Hi.. any idea how to fix this http://jsfiddle.net/m62mbd9e/
[11:03:26] <mAxX--> ?
[11:05:26] <mAxX--> Hi.. any idea how to fix this dropdown multilevel  http://www.bootply.com/9mROJSnagu
[11:12:55] <decx> mAxX-- when you removeClass active on click you also remove the active class from the menu that's opening the 2nd layer
[11:19:03] <mAxX--> decx is it something wrong twith the css?
[11:24:51] <decx> no mAxX-- only remove active when the element doesnt have parents with active
[11:26:45] <mAxX--> umm
[11:26:49] <mAxX--> i see
[11:27:14] <decx> doesnt bootstrap handle that stuff itself anyway??
[11:27:46] <mAxX--> not with a click
[11:27:51] <decx> in any case, there: !$(this).closest('.active').length && $("li.dropdown-submenu").removeClass("active");
[11:30:05] <mAxX--> decx, however i realized theres an issue with return false as when i click on a link seems to be disabled
[11:30:46] <decx> yeah all the links are in the li
[11:30:57] <decx> put the event on navbar-toggle instead
[11:31:16] <decx> or what it is called
[11:31:20] <decx> .dropdown-toggle
[11:31:48] <mAxX--> let me check
[11:33:00] <mAxX--> decx, $("li.dropdown-toggle").on("click", function() ?
[11:33:54] <decx> you'll have to restructure stuff
[11:34:05] <decx> shower time for me
[11:34:12] <mAxX--> thanks
[12:02:48] <schtinky> I need to select a div by ID within another div by ID
[12:04:40] <bacobart> schtinky, id's are supposed to be unique
[12:04:56] <bacobart> so you can just do $('#nameofid')
[12:05:16] <schtinky> bacobart, yeah that's the ideal scenario, but that's not the way this is built
[12:05:47] <schtinky> $("#unique_outer_id).find("#nonuniuque_inner_id")?
[12:06:18] <bacobart> it's invalid html (both html4 and html5) according to the spec
[12:06:22] <bacobart> so i doubt it'll ever work
[12:06:28] <bacobart> but maybe somebody else knows for sure:)
[12:08:46] * CssN00b good morning and good night y'all
[13:18:56] <Bogdaniel> any ideas why an ajax call on localhost works just fine but when I try it on the live server it always hits me with a 404 error on the page requested yet the file is there it works if you access in the browser
[13:47:39] <EGreg> hey y'all
[13:47:41] <EGreg> question!
[13:47:43] <EGreg> (yes, really)
[13:48:01] <EGreg> Does the "zoom" css property get factored in when computing .width(), css('width') etc?
[14:01:24] <nathaneltitane> hey there: i have a 'load more' script that loads hidden divs when the load-more anchor is clicked
[14:01:52] <nathaneltitane> how do i go about and make it scroll to the next div it unhides?
[14:02:20] <nathaneltitane> http://sprunge.us/ONGM
[14:09:51] <daum_> if i'm trying to select all elements which either have an attribute not equal to 1 or no attribute at all, what is the right way to do that?  [data-user!="1"] doesn't seem to work
[14:10:11] <daum_> as anything that lacks the data-user doesn't get selected
[14:21:26] <RedShift> hi all
[14:21:42] <RedShift> what's the recommended way to return errors to a client when doing AJAX?
[14:21:59] <RedShift> say when a form has been filled, but the backend code detects the last name hasn't been filled in
[14:22:12] <RedShift> what's the proper way to return this error to the client?
[14:25:46] <bengalo> RedShift totally up to you, im returning json encoded status, success of my action and a message
[14:26:08] <bengalo> but whatever fits your purpose, since your probably not releasing an api
[14:26:12] <RedShift> there's not a universal "this is the best way" to do it?
[14:26:47] <bengalo> a return schema for an ajax request, i dont think so
[14:27:14] <bengalo> you can check out how big frameworks handle this
[14:27:28] <RedShift> ok
[14:27:34] <RedShift> thanks
[14:27:35] <bengalo> but thats a lot of work for nothing, youre free to design whatever fits
[14:28:34] <bacobart> if you're starting on a new app i would suggest using a framework that handles validation etc anyway
[14:28:39] <bengalo> for your purpose you might want to return an array/object containing validation action for your fields
[14:28:44] <bacobart> no need to reinvent the wheel
[14:32:04] <RedShift> I've seen code that uses HTTP error codes, but that's not very flexible, doesn't really allow you to return a fine-grained error response
[14:32:39] <RedShift> so yeah just gonna go with having a "success" field in my json return
[14:47:28] <hyperking> is there a jquery method for converted html escaped data from json back to html tags?
[14:55:13] <OnceMe> hello, how can I on click show
[14:55:23] <OnceMe> div, however to change link
[15:42:15] <SylvieLorxu> Hey everyone. Does anyone know how I could toggle the class of an object that has been faded out? Somehowe, toggleClass seems to stop working if I run it as a callback after fadeOut()
[15:46:04] <SylvieLorxu> JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/z0xgz6j4/
[15:46:21] <SylvieLorxu> Wait, huh
[15:46:31] <SylvieLorxu> It works in that fiddle
[17:27:16] <superspring> hey, is anyone familiar with any UML tools written in/with jQuery?
[17:35:06] <acidjazz> uml why
[17:48:58] <sadtaco> Eh so... When I have $('a').click(function(){ //code here }); That function is reallyst just created once then instanced for each time it's bound to that element, right?
[17:50:08] <acidjazz> well
[17:50:25] <acidjazz> itll run for any anchor element currently on the dom
[17:50:40] <acidjazz> itll bind and scrape to any <a
[17:54:24] <acidjazz> win 10
[19:18:12] <symfonius> Hello, has anyone here used Select2?
[19:24:05] <fattest> Why doesn't my  $( event.target ).closest( ".hidden" ).toggle(); work ? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2572/
[19:26:47] <fattest> it works if i do .next
[19:28:26] <fattest>  $( event.target ).closest( "tr .hidden" ).next().toggle(); does not work
[19:28:37] <fattest> http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2574/
[19:30:40] <shoky_> fattest: .closest only looks up the dom, not at siblings.  you can just do $(this).next('.hidden').toggle()
[19:31:27] <fattest> shoky_: thank you! how do i make it not trigger for the header <tr > (the sorting column)
[19:33:05] <shoky_> fattest: it's not running the toggle for that line, but you're re-ordering all the <tr>s when sorting.. so the order gets jumbled up between the .hidden and non hidden...
[19:33:33] <sammych> fattest: $().not('tr')?
[19:33:52] <shoky_> that's not what he wants
[19:34:08] <fattest> shoky_: http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2576/ click on the header twice
[19:34:20] <fattest> you'll see sum $180
[19:35:29] <shoky_> because you're re-ordering all the rows. mixing up hidden and non hidden
[19:35:47] <shoky_> it ruins any chance of toggling the right row, header or not
[19:35:54] <fattest> what should i do?
[19:35:57] <nathaneltitane> hey :)
[19:38:43] <shoky_> fattest: this works.. http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2577/
[19:41:05] <shoky_> well, except for the first column. because your sorting is looking at all <td>s including the hidden one
[19:41:51] <fattest> hm
[19:42:01] <fattest> what should i do?
[19:42:28] <shoky_> o.o
[19:49:47] <fattest> shoky_: if i click on the <tr> to show/hide content, why isn't my button's text not changing? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2578/
[19:50:58] <shoky_> uhh
[19:51:10] <shoky_> don't use the same click handler for handling clicks on the row, and handling clicks on the button
[19:51:30] <fattest> shoky_: wouldn't it be more efficient?
[19:51:34] <shoky_> and you keep using .closest wrong, donno what you're trying to do with it
[19:51:36] <shoky_> no
[19:51:45] <nathaneltitane> id like for the .load-more (top right + anchor) to reveal and scroll to the hidden divs at the bottom... help?
[19:52:58] <fattest> shoky_: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2579/
[19:55:11] <shoky_> yes.. add  event.stopPropagation();  if you want it to not trigger the <tr> click handler too
[19:56:43] <fattest> shoky_: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2580/
[19:57:09] <shoky_> no i meant in the button handler. but it seems you want to use the button instead of the tr click anyway
[19:57:52] <fattest> shoky_ that doesn't toggle though http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2581/
[19:58:11] <nathaneltitane> it seems that the code only runs on the initial click and not after for any subsequent divs
[20:00:09] <nathaneltitane> update http://jsfiddle.net/uvag4kLv/1/
[20:02:23] <shoky_> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2582/
[20:03:59] <fattest> shoky_: i need it to work if i click on the <tr> row as well, not just the button
[20:04:27] <shoky_> uh
[20:04:52] <shoky_> ok then just remove the stopPropagation from the previous fiddle..
[20:06:23] <fattest> shoky_: but then the text of the button does not change if i click on <tr > http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2583/
[20:06:35] <shoky_> http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2584/
[20:07:13] <fattest> thank you very much
[20:07:31] <shoky_> yw
[20:07:43] <nathaneltitane> ??
[20:52:20] <matgee> Hey - how can I wait for an ajax call to complete before moving on without making the request synchronous
[20:53:15] <sadtaco> So uh.  I have some contenteditable="true" fields on my page.  I'm also using autocomplete.  When I select something with autcomplete, I see the html as a string in there instead of it rendering the html. I'm ... not sure what to do about that.
[20:53:49] <sadtaco> Oh wait I see it
[20:54:51] <sadtaco> well not really :\
[20:58:03] <fattest> Shoky_ I have more than one table, but if i click on a header in one of the table, it sorts the second table as well. How can I fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2587/
[21:02:04] <blubberbop> So I try to make a <select> auto submit by adding $("#id").change(function(){ $(this).closest("form").submit() }); This always works! but now, in one form, for some reason, it suddenly does not, and for the life of me I cannot find out why.. I have tried to add console.log($(this).closest("form")) and it shows jquery finds the form.. It just doesn't want to submit it for some reason..
[21:02:17] <shoky_> fattest: you need to fix the sorting code.. currently it looks at table.find('td')  which is all the <td>s in all tables
[21:02:39] <blubberbop> So, with that in mind, is there any reason why jquery .submit() would not submit that form??
[21:02:49] <shoky_> fattest: you also have duplicate ID's, that's not valid
[21:04:05] <fattest> shoky_: ok i put them into class http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2589/ now how can i fix my sorting?
[21:04:40] <shoky_> fattest: make it not look at all td's in all tables. not gonna do it for you
[21:05:19] <shoky_> var table = $('table');  that's both tables.  then in the sort there's:  table.find('td')   that's all td's in all tables.
[21:06:56] <fattest> shoky_: I change  var table = $('table'); to select the table closest to mouse ?
[21:07:26] <fattest> that way, it only selects one table?
[21:07:38] <P1RATEZ> blubberbop, 1. can validate the page first to eliminate errors, 2. can press F12 and set a breakpoint and trace it to see the output and where it stops
[21:07:57] <shoky_> fattest: in the sort code, you need to select only td's inside the current table.
[21:08:26] <shoky_> var table = $('table')  is done outside the sort code anyway, there's no "current table" in that part of the code
[21:08:32] <fattest> shoky_: but how do you know which one is the current table
[21:08:43] <blubberbop> P1RATEZ: Already found the problem.. I had a submit button called "submit" and with that, jQuery won't submit no longer
[21:08:50] <shoky_> fattest: you know which <th> you're sorting. so you can also know which table that th is in
[21:10:00] <P1RATEZ> matgee: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23211631/wait-for-ajax-to-finish-before-proceeding-with-the-loop
[21:10:12] <matgee> P1RATEZ: thx
[21:10:37] <shoky_> blubberbop yep because browsers are idiots and if you have an input named "submit" it takes over the .submit() function. jquery isn't at fault ;p
[21:11:07] <blubberbop> shoky_: that sounds more like a shitty JS design...
[21:11:23] <shoky_> it's shitty backwards compatibilty in chrome and IE
[21:12:35] <shoky_> and the reason was so that if you had an input name "someinput" that you could easily access it in js via document.myform.someinput  for example. so if someinput is "submit"  that'd take over document.myform.submit
[21:12:55] <shoky_> and for some idiotic reason, chrome and IE still let it happen
[21:13:13] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/nrfy733v/ Okay here. When I select "test" from the autocomplete, how do I get it to show in the input as italics with the em tags instead of actually showing the html itself?
[21:13:20] <shoky_> and chrome was only doing it originally to emulate IE. sigh
[21:20:52] <shoky_> sadtaco: $.ui.autocomplete.prototype._value = function(value) { this.element.html(value);   };
[21:21:53] <sadtaco> Thank you so much!
[21:22:01] <sadtaco> That was an odd one.
[21:22:22] <shoky_> sadtaco: oh actually _value needs to also function as a getter
[21:22:49] <arschmitz> sadtaco: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/blob/master/src/autocomplete/jquery.ui.autocomplete.html.js
[21:22:57] <sadtaco> Is there a way to only set the setter portno of it, or what do I do?
[21:25:21] <sadtaco> arschmitz, same issue
[21:25:30] <sadtaco> That's just similar code to what I have now, just with an optin.
[21:25:32] <sadtaco> option
[21:25:55] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/nrfy733v/1/ see? Unless I'm missing something
[21:26:31] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/nrfy733v/2/ what shoky says works, unless there is an issue of _value not functioning as a getter
[21:26:45] <sadtaco> Do I need "return value" or something?
[21:27:22] <shoky_> sadtaco: http://jsfiddle.net/nrfy733v/3/
[21:27:41] <sadtaco> ty
[21:29:14] <shoky_> sadtaco: er this is shorter:  return this.element.html(value);
[21:29:33] <shoky_> http://jsfiddle.net/nrfy733v/4/
[21:30:06] <sadtaco> Alright
[21:39:56] <shoky_> sadtaco: actually use the longer one :)  .html(undefined) doesn't work as a getter it seems
[21:40:05] <sadtaco> Ah
[21:52:59] <sadtaco> would think that return  this.element.html(value) ||  this.element.html(); would work?  I don't know how to test it, though
[21:53:04] <sadtaco> I don't know how that getter gets called
[21:53:27] <fattest> shoky_: how do i select table by clicking on th ?

[22:45:47] <jikuja> how do I share function for multiple jquery plugins?
[22:57:24] <Cork> jikuja: depends, if the plugin is defined in the same file you could wrap it in a scope
[22:57:43] <Cork> else you would have to use an object both can access and share it on there
[23:03:03] <jikuja> actually google finally answered to my question. Had to try five times before getting tutorials/examples I wanted.
[23:31:14] <PhizoR> Hi guys, I have a problem and my knowledge on jquery and ajax called pages are not enough to fix it myself
[23:31:23] <PhizoR> can anyone please look at the following to pages
[23:31:34] <PhizoR> index.php : http://paste.ee/p/aSs5R#oSPg2bnCXusASMXdWy0J7slkzDhSEvL5
[23:31:37] <Cork> ?ask @ PhizoR
[23:31:37] <b-ot> PhizoR: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:31:42] <PhizoR> item.php : http://paste.ee/p/ftXd2#Oo0EJybM97Er2yp3GXZ2UiRpiLCPMPsX
[23:32:44] <PhizoR> so it works if everything is on one page, but stops working when you call the images from another page with ajax
[23:34:39] <Uhkis> not really jquery question..
[23:35:10] <PhizoR> Uhkis, can you maybe still help
[23:35:21] <PhizoR> the jquery doesnt work when images are called from ajax page
[23:35:31] <PhizoR> think it has something to do with on()
[23:35:49] <PhizoR> but thats only a shot in the dark from my side
[23:36:25] <Cork> PhizoR: you haven't really asked a question yet except "please look here"
[23:37:37] <PhizoR> Cork, how can you make jquery work on a ajax called page
[23:38:03] <Cork> wow paste.ee sucks...
[23:38:25] <Cork> PhizoR: for future reference, use jsfiddle.net for the content
[23:39:31] <Cork> ok can't load the pastes anymore...
[23:39:45] <Cork> anyway from what i saw though there wasn't any jquery in there
[23:40:31] <jikuja> maybe in test/jquery.bxslider.min.js
[23:40:34] <PhizoR> js file was called, the thing is, how to get the jquery to work on ajax called page, hold, i'm pasting everything again, and trying to make it work on jsfiddle
[23:40:49] <Cork> ?paste @ PhizoR
[23:40:49] <b-ot> PhizoR: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:46:02] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[23:51:05] <PhizoR> ok, cant get it to work on jsfiddle : but here is it on the server working, if the images/thumbs are on the original page and not called in with ajax : http://41.76.215.203/~zanderco/zander.php , so when you click the button it doesnt work anymore as the items are called in over ajax
[23:51:45] <PhizoR> zander.php : http://paste.ee/p/aSs5R#oSPg2bnCXusASMXdWy0J7slkzDhSEvL5  (how it should look as the images moes not show until you cliked the button)
[23:52:16] <PhizoR> item.php : http://paste.ee/p/ftXd2#Oo0EJybM97Er2yp3GXZ2UiRpiLCPMPsX   when click images and div pulled from here
[23:58:48] <PhizoR> jsfiffle (cant get it to work here) http://jsfiddle.net/cmr3pxbv/
