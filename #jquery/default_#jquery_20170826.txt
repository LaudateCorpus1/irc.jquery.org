[02:32:41] <Dejavu> Hi, I have a problem with the $("style").each(function (){...}. The .each loop is executed squarely with every additional element and not one time.
[02:32:41] <Dejavu> When I click on the first time on the link, i get one style tag, the second click 2 elements and with the third 4 etc.
[02:32:41] <Dejavu> I have no idea why ...

[03:47:33] <kiwi_72756> need help plz
[04:04:02] <kiwi_45706> hi guy how can I select all child of a parent ?
[04:10:28] <kiwi_45706> plz
[04:10:33] <kiwi_45706> still waiting
[05:35:02] <kiwi_32462> guys how i select child ?
[05:38:15] <pavonia> Which child?
[05:39:20] <kiwi_32462> wait 2sec
[05:40:12] <kiwi_32462> I have this https://pastebin.com/C891P0N9
[05:40:45] <kiwi_32462> when I click on an element I get the value of parent
[05:41:03] <kiwi_32462> for exemple there 2 classes mail and password
[05:41:33] <kiwi_32462> what I want to do is making a concatenation with the 2
[05:45:53] <pavonia> I don't understand what you mean. You want to concatenate the class names of the parent?
[05:48:04] <kiwi_32462> wait 2min i'll share html source code
[05:50:26] <kiwi_32462> https://pastebin.com/cURpVjmz
[05:50:41] <kiwi_32462> what I wanted to do is alert(time + " " + nick + " " + text);
[05:51:21] <kiwi_32462> but I can't store nick and time in variable
[05:54:15] <pavonia> You can use children() and then map or forEach over them building the string
[05:56:04] <kiwi_32462> I don't know how to make it
[05:56:22] <kiwi_32462> can u show me an example of source code ?
[05:58:13] <pavonia> One moment
[05:58:24] <kiwi_32462> ok i just refresh
[05:58:56] <kiwi_1952> i'm back
[06:04:23] <kiwi_32462> pavonia: here ?
[06:04:56] <pavonia> Yes, please wait a moment
[06:05:26] <kiwi_32462> ok thx
[06:06:03] <kiwi_32462> just one think according the parent I can use it's class name as they are other that have the same
[06:13:01] <kiwi_32462> I refresh
[06:14:13] <pavonia> Bah, I can't get it work
[06:16:01] <kiwi_35082> pavonia:  i'm here
[06:24:14] <pavonia> kiwi_35082: https://jsfiddle.net/sbdt6ejL/
[06:24:31] <pavonia> That took some doing ... :S
[06:25:07] <kiwi_35082> thx I try
[06:27:48] <kiwi_35082> nice it's working
[07:13:23] <kiwi_35082> hi all why parent.querySelector(".text").innerText; tell me VM2131:1 Uncaught TypeError: parent.querySelector is not a function
[07:13:23] <kiwi_35082>     at <anonymous>:1:8
[07:37:12] <kiwi_62176> pavonia: how can I store each one in a variable https://jsfiddle.net/sbdt6ejL/ ?
[07:37:21] <kiwi_62176> because I want to manipulate them
[07:38:19] <pavonia> They are stored in texts already
[07:38:43] <kiwi_62176> yes but I want to store each one on a var
[07:39:30] <kiwi_62176> and make alert(var1 + " " + var2);
[07:39:55] <pavonia> I don't think you can do that, you have to use an array or object
[07:40:28] <pavonia> Or don't use map but query each child individually
[07:40:30] <kiwi_62176> yes but if I want to edit it how I can do ?
[07:40:52] <kiwi_62176> yes that's what i was looking for
[07:41:21] <kiwi_62176> I tried querySelector but doesn't work
[07:41:42] <pavonia> You don't need querySelector, you already use JQuery
[07:42:04] <kiwi_62176> how so ?
[07:42:15] <pavonia> e.g. var time = $(this).parent().find(".time").text()
[07:42:34] <kiwi_62176> ah yes that's why it doesn't work
[07:42:42] <kiwi_62176> i didn't used find()
[13:03:21] <forgotmynick> hello
[13:03:36] <forgotmynick> how do i hide a element inside a shadow root?
[16:38:17] <jak2000> sometimes i need erase cahce data browsing, exist a way for do it automatically? or each Monday?
[16:40:52] <cannap> what
[16:41:00] <jak2000> how to fix, i am developing a system, and fail sometimes because cahe data browsing
[16:46:30] <pavonia> Disable caching
[16:47:35] <jak2000> in other channel say me:
[16:47:41] <jak2000> <warri0rr> The server sends some headers related to cache. Check them
[16:47:45] <jak2000> can you explain me more? please
[17:21:11] <pavonia> jak2000: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control
[17:21:29] <pavonia> Not sure this will help you on the client site, though
[17:23:47] <jak2000> pavonia you know about jsp?
[17:24:06] <pavonia> No
[17:24:37] <pavonia> Do you want to disable caching for your own server only or in general?
[17:25:17] <jak2000> owns erver
[17:26:01] <pavonia> Ah, then Cache-Control might be worth looking into
[17:26:41] <jak2000> https://paste.debian.net/983162/
[17:26:45] <jak2000> then this correct?
[17:39:49] <kiwi_83702> hi all
[17:39:50] <kiwi_83702> var area = $("#kiwi .controlbox textarea"); alert(area.val); if (area.val == "/reset") {$('.style-reset').click();}
[17:39:58] <kiwi_83702> why this give me undefined
[17:40:11] <kiwi_83702> it is supposed to get the value of area
[17:40:30] <cannap> sure?
[17:40:43] <kiwi_83702> yes
[17:40:44] <kiwi_83702> but it doesn't work
[17:41:29] <cannap> did you try val()
[17:41:58] <kiwi_83702> i'll try
[17:42:28] <kiwi_83702> nice it works^^
[17:42:29] <kiwi_83702> thx
[17:42:51] <kiwi_83702> egergeg
[17:43:47] <kiwi_83702>  cannap: why area.val() == "/reset" doesn't wor
[17:44:05] <cannap> how looks val
[17:44:16] <cannap> use indexOf
[17:44:49] <kiwi_83702> it gives me the right value
[17:44:55] <cannap> show the value
[17:45:04] <kiwi_83702> the value comes from the fact that when /reset is not yet written it doesn't work
[17:45:04] <cannap> use === will check for the type and the vlaue
[17:45:05] <cannap> value
[17:45:20] <cannap> val from input is always a string
[17:45:21] <kiwi_83702> it's not relatted to type and value
[17:45:50] <kiwi_83702> when I write /reset before injecting this code in console it works
[17:46:01] <kiwi_83702> but while I inject and then write /reset it doesn't
[17:46:28] <kiwi_83702> this peace of code is supposed to change color to default value in kiwi irc
[17:53:49] <kiwi_10281> cannap: var area = $("#kiwi .controlbox textarea");if (area.val() == "/reset") {$('.style-reset').click();}  this works
[17:54:02] <cannap> nice
[17:54:11] <kiwi_10281> but only if /reset is written before I inject this code in console
[17:54:28] <kiwi_10281> how can I make it working all the time before or after ?
[18:04:15] <kiwi_10281>  qsvqsv
[18:13:39] <kiwi_89508> cannap: window.setInterval(function(){var area = $("#kiwi .controlbox textarea");if (area.val() == "/reset") {$('.style-reset').click();}}, 1000);     now it works^^
