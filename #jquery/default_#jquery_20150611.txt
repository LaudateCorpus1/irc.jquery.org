[01:45:48] <hackal> Hello, how can I target an element (input) in form without class/id inside $('.form1, .form2, .form3').submit(function(e) { ... }); ?
[01:46:18] <micalm> hackal: like you would in css
[01:46:30] <micalm> "form input" ;)
[01:46:54] <hackal> micalm: what if I have several forms? I need to refer to form which was submitted
[01:47:20] <hackal> something like "this input" where this refers to submited form
[01:48:07] <crpc> Hello.
[01:48:18] <crpc> I'd like to verify if some (randomly numbered) radiosets in my page are all checked. I ended up coding this function, but I guess there is a way to do this better. Anyone care to have a look ? Thank you :) http://codepen.io/ksm101/pen/NqgNLB
[02:05:16] <hackal> micalm: here is example https://jsfiddle.net/z6jeLoae/4/ try to fill in the second form with email
[02:10:31] <micalm> hackal: you cooould use https://jsfiddle.net/z6jeLoae/5/
[02:10:36] <micalm> Its hacky though.
[02:17:12] <Cork> hackal: if you want to target the input in the form just use $(this).find('input[type="text"]')
[02:17:51] <Cork> hackal: https://jsfiddle.net/z6jeLoae/6/
[02:18:08] <Cork> (also don't forget to define your variables)
[02:19:17] <Cork> hackal: also i would do this change https://jsfiddle.net/z6jeLoae/7/
[02:22:03] <hackal> Cork: thank you
[02:22:34] <hackal> also it seems that instead of find I could just do $('input', this).val();
[02:22:46] <Cork> hackal: that is the exact same thing
[02:23:00] <Cork> only difference is that you proxy the same call through $()
[02:23:11] <Cork> cause $() calls this.find internally

[02:36:16] <K4T> how I can pass array of objects as a query params in url?
[02:38:02] <Cork> K4T: params can't hold an array or object
[02:38:08] <Cork> only key=value pares
[02:38:23] <K4T> I have identical array like here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1290138
[02:38:36] <Cork> $.ajax has built in support for converting key:[{a:b}] to key[0][a]=b
[02:38:38] <K4T> and now I need to pass that array through query params
[02:38:50] <K4T> ymm I have to only build correct url and open it in JS
[02:39:14] <Cork> what is the resulting url you need?
[02:40:56] <K4T> I want to get these parameters in PHP as an array, example: $data = [0 => ['url' => 'my-url', 'pageNum' => 1], 1 => ['url' => 'my-url', 'pageNum' => 2]]
[02:41:11] <Cork> you can't do that
[02:41:17] <Cork> params doesn't work like that
[02:41:52] <Cork> or...
[02:42:55] <K4T> https://gist.github.com/K4T/860b2468104252711d8d here you can see how I am building my array with objects which I want to pass through query params
[02:42:55] <Cork> K4T: try data: { key: [{url: 'my-url', pageNum: 1 }, { url: 'my-url', pageNum: 2 }] }
[02:43:24] <Cork> that should generate key[0][url]=my-url&key[0][pageNum]=1&...
[02:43:46] <K4T> ok
[02:43:50] <Cork> and that should map to $_POST['key'] having what you want
[02:44:11] <Macaveli> When do you need to provide a "return" in JS?
[02:44:17] <Macaveli> More a coffee / js question
[02:44:33] <Cork> Macaveli: you never have to use return
[02:44:40] <Cork> it is completely optional
[02:44:53] <Cork> well you have to use it if you want to return something or exit early
[02:45:56] <Macaveli> Cork well the following code does not work without the return for me -> https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/4f731fd05b1ecbe496fc
[02:46:16] <Cork> Macaveli: remove the return and generate the js and pb that
[02:46:30] <Cork> you can't know what the problem is from the coffiescript junnk
[02:46:34] <Cork> *junk
[02:55:33] <Macaveli> Cork the return is neeeded in coffe;)
[02:55:50] <Cork> Macaveli: yes, but why you need it can't be told from looking at the uncompiled code
[02:56:12] <Cork> cause you need to see what mess coffiescript makes to tell why you need it
[02:56:53] <Cork> Macaveli: but i would guess at window.dataLayer.push returning a falsy value and that causes coffiescript to return a false value and abort things
[02:57:08] <Macaveli> Cork
[02:57:19] <Macaveli> are you god?
[02:58:28] <tuskkk___> I have added a new list, using http://loudev.com/#usage, but how do I add its data to be POSTED with the form?
[02:59:53] <tuskkk___> here is how it looks like, http://jsfiddle.net/d7cuyxsw/1/
[03:04:39] <Cork> Macaveli: just to be clear, my biggest hat for coffiescript is that it imports the worst feature of ruby into js
[03:04:53] <Cork> and that is to make implicit returns
[03:05:26] <Cork> and implicit returns basically makes you add return to every function you ever make, cause else you might return something in some case that breaks things
[03:05:27] <Macaveli> I understand I just like it cause it's shorter
[03:05:29] <Cork> (like you just saw)
[03:05:38] <Macaveli> indeed
[03:05:53] <Cork> if find ecmascripts solution to be 100 times better
[03:06:13] <Cork> cause then you have to explicitly say to do the implicit return
[03:06:25] <Cork> so you basically can't do it by mistake
[03:06:36] <Cork> () => func() <-- implicit
[03:06:42] <Cork> () => { func() } <-- none implicit
[03:18:01] <tuskkk___> can I create a hidden input field, and then from the JS callback add values to that form field?
[03:42:34] <Kartagis> tuskkk___: http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/2dv26nm0/
[03:43:24] <tuskkk___> Kartagis: yes, but if we need an array as the input field? how to append values, my current code just adds the latest value
[03:44:20] <tuskkk___> here is what I have, http://jsfiddle.net/2dv26nm0/2/
[03:44:23] <Kartagis> tuskkk___: so, you need several hidden fields
[03:46:35] <tuskkk___> but there is some email adding form too, and it accepts an array with multiple emails, here is what I got from $_POST, https://bpaste.net/show/d5228420caff
[03:51:45] <tuskkk___> can't we do any loop or something?
[04:00:28] <Kartagis> yes you can, but I can't help with that
[04:26:16] <parveen> task_html="";    myfunction();   console.log(task_html);     i added content to task_html veriable in myfunction();
[04:26:29] <parveen> but console shows blank
[04:26:42] <Cork> parveen: most likely cause what you used in myfunction was async
[04:26:59] <Cork> meaning it will run later
[04:27:15] <parveen> Cork  in myfunction()   i have html only
[04:27:21] <Cork> ?demo
[04:27:21] <b-ot> Cork: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:27:40] <Cork> preferably the fiddle

[04:45:02] <tuskkk___> Kartagis: thanks, but I got it working by doing something very similar!
[04:45:32] <tuskkk___> here is what i did,http://jsfiddle.net/2dv26nm0/4/

[05:04:13] <Pazician> Hello, I'm having trouble with slideToggle and the menu slide thing with it self... I've tried with stop(), and stop(false, false, true), and other ones like stop(false, true) and so on, but none of them really work as I want. It works just fine if you don't resize the window but on window resize it messes up and go crazy, like repeating the toggle. This is my code within the resize function: https://gist.github.com/
[05:04:14] <Pazician> anonymous/7965e491f018a282329d and this is the code outside the resize function: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fafde1d2eeb65b23a4f5

[05:08:58] <JosefDe> Hey guys. I use $.ajax(). Inside of always() I try doing if(outervariablex == contentx) which leads to the error "contentx" is undefined. But if I do console.log before this comparison both outer variables are set.  How can I fix this?
[05:10:42] <Cork> JosefDe: jsfiddle the code
[05:11:48] <JosefDe> ok
[05:15:15] <JosefDe> https://jsfiddle.net/f1e5281m/2/
[05:15:17] <JosefDe> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/f1e5281m/2/
[05:15:38] <JosefDe> The error occurs in "always()" in the if-condition
[05:15:45] <JosefDe> Cork: The error occurs in "always()" in the if-condition
[05:15:57] <Cork> JosefDe: and this is in chrome?
[05:16:03] <JosefDe> Firefox
[05:16:06] <Cork> hmm
[05:16:31] <Cork> didn't think they had scope inheritance optimization
[05:16:51] <Cork> JosefDe: set serach = search; as the first line in always
[05:16:56] <Cork> *search
[05:16:59] <JosefDe> ok
[05:17:28] <Cork> JosefDe: what most likely is happening is that the jit optimizer doesn't see that search is used in the always callback
[05:17:41] <Cork> so it thinks nothing needs it anymore and frees it
[05:17:49] <Cork> so when you later try to use it it fails
[05:19:08] <JosefDe> Cork: You saved my day! I'm at work and under time pressure.
[05:19:29] <printForever> I've dreaded this question for a long time... I need to show a popup 1s after the page loads for the visitor. Fade in kind of a thing.
[05:19:57] <printForever> I've never had to use popups before, but its for marketing some bloody coupons...
[05:20:16] <printForever> how can I trigger the lightbox to show the popup?
[05:20:16] <Cork> printForever: have you solved the actual popup code?
[05:20:27] <printForever> I have the popup HTML/CSS thing down
[05:20:40] <printForever> I just need an idea how to trigger showing of the popup
[05:20:41] <Cork> setTimeout(function() { /* show the popup */ }, 1000);
[05:21:02] <printForever> but... something needs to trigger the setTimeout, am I right?
[05:21:08] <Cork> just have that at the bottom of the page
[05:21:10] <printForever> like... it wont execute by just loading
[05:21:17] <Cork> <script>setTimeout</script>
[05:21:33] <Cork> bottom of the page as in straight before the </body>
[05:22:09] <printForever> and thats it?
[05:22:20] <printForever> no... triggers, no .on() or .mouseIn()
[05:22:22] <printForever> or anything
[05:22:37] <Cork> nope
[05:22:49] <printForever> well, I'll be...
[05:22:51] <Cork> the "show popup" needs to trigger the animation though
[05:23:09] <Cork> but you can do that with css3 or js
[05:23:21] <printForever> CSS3 will suffice
[05:23:27] <JosefDe> Mhh.. no it doesnt work
[05:23:34] <printForever> thx Cork
[05:23:41] <printForever> JosefDe, what doesnt work?
[05:25:20] <Cork> JosefDe: i can't see any other reason why that would happen
[05:27:33] <JosefDe> Now the local variables in always() are "undefined"
[05:29:47] <JosefDe> The problem is that the outer variable is undefined. And If i assign undefined to local variable then it's also undefined
[05:32:54] <Es0teric> ugh.. vertical sliders man
[05:32:57] <Es0teric> damn vertical sliders

[08:25:17] <jscheel> Hello everyone! I’m having an odd error where my jqXHR object’s status code is wrong. I’m making an ajax request that is returning a 400 error, but the jqXHR object returns a 404 error. Any idea why that might be?
[08:25:43] <jscheel> looking at the request in devtools proves that the the response is 400
[08:31:31] <Cork> jscheel: the only reason i can think of is if ( !status && options.isLocal && !options.crossDomain ) { status = responses.text ? 200 : 404; }
[08:32:23] <Cork> it's used if this regex matches the url /^(?:about|app|app-storage|.+-extension|file|res|widget):$/
[08:33:32] <jscheel> Cork: it’s a cross-domain jsonp request
[08:33:47] <Cork> hmm what version of jquery?
[08:33:52] <jscheel> 2.1.3
[08:34:11] <Cork> jsonp doens't have response statuses
[08:34:17] <Cork> it has network error
[08:34:35] <Cork> <script src="target" onerror="status == 404">
[08:34:45] <Cork> so there isn't much jquery can do there
[08:34:55] <jscheel> right, that makes sense
[08:35:21] <Cork> i don't even think it can differenciate 5xx vs 4xx
[08:35:56] <Cork> (though i might be wrong on that one)
[08:38:10] <jscheel> Cork: interesting, so it can’t even get the response body at that point, right?
[08:38:34] <Cork> nope
[08:38:39] <jscheel> blerg
[08:38:48] <Cork> its the cost of doing jsonp
[08:38:58] <Cork> jsonp is a workaround for cors
[08:39:16] <Cork> now days you can configure the server to support cors without using jsonp

[10:13:26] <ngharo> but as others mentioned, check out the jquery serialize() docs
[10:13:30] <ngharo> it might be easier and do what you want
[10:15:23] <lng> ngharo: it's embedded form - not sure I need serialize()
[10:16:11] <lng> http://blog.avirtualhome.com/how-to-create-nested-forms/
[10:18:08] <ght> I have a two nested loops that append values to a string. Because jquery is pass by value (and not reference), these changes aren't being applied to the variable. What's the best way to handle this?
[10:18:50] <ght> For example, in Ruby, if you declare a hash array and pass it as a parameter, it will pass by reference, not value, so changes to the hash in called functions will persist after the function finishes execution.
[10:21:40] <ngharo> ght: can you create a fiddle to show a test case
[10:23:29] <notchris> If I have CORS access, can I create a clone of a form on another page and upon submit, have it act like it submitted the real form?
[10:51:02] <ngharo> probably?
[11:01:39] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[11:04:42] <zzaichik> Are you spinning in your chair?
[11:04:50] <robertmaxrees> sure yeah that.

[11:12:56] <robertmaxrees> silly spambots
[11:17:24] <monk12> hey all, just curious. im looking over some jquery code put on a table and not sure the intentions: $('.grid_header_row th, .grid_header_row td').css('width', '+=0');
[11:17:37] <robertmaxrees> what are you lost on?
[11:17:52] <monk12> hey robertmaxrees... just curious, whats that "+=0" do? wasnt sure of my intention.
[11:17:57] <monk12> 2 year old code hehe
[11:18:05] <AbuDhar> hey
[11:18:11] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[11:18:17] <robertmaxrees> that's setting width to that string.
[11:18:21] <AbuDhar> oh lol
[11:18:33] <robertmaxrees> monk12 that's... interesting
[11:18:42] <monk12> yeh. there must have been a reason. i'll research what it does
[11:18:46] <AbuDhar> how can I create html and save it in a var? :)
[11:19:09] <AbuDhar> the best way of course.
[11:19:59] <Protomega> This code throws an error of (...).repeat(...) is not a function http://jsfiddle.net/creativecouple/QVtmJ/27/
[11:20:02] <robertmaxrees> "the best way" AbuDhar?
[11:20:05] <robertmaxrees> there are lots of ways.
[11:20:09] <monk12> liek the widths on the page aren't 0 they are values like width="60". i must have manually  needed the floating header to have a real width  for some reason. maybe to work with a floating header plugin
[11:20:25] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees, I think I should use the .html() function :)
[11:20:32] <robertmaxrees> errr..
[11:20:39] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar what are you actually trying to do?
[11:20:43] <monk12> i think the +=0 takes the current width and just creates a manual width variable with teh same value the browser used for the table.
[11:20:49] <Protomega> Any ideas as to what could be wrong? I do know that jQuery is working because I'm able to use it in any other situation.
[11:21:03] <AbuDhar> <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="2" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="min-width: 2em; width: 2%;">2%</div>
[11:21:04] <monk12> yes that must be it :)
[11:21:07] <robertmaxrees> Protomega i'm not familiar with any method called "repeat"
[11:21:08] <AbuDhar> want to store this in an variable
[11:21:11] <AbuDhar> and use it in my append
[11:21:14] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees,  :)
[11:21:23] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar why not just var $myObject = $('.progress-bar');
[11:21:28] <robertmaxrees> then you can clone and append it.
[11:21:35] <YamakasY> hi guys
[11:22:14] <YamakasY> when I get a 404 in my ajax script for whatever reason, can I get that in apache and serve another page than my original error page ?
[11:22:33] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees, that sounds easy. :) but there should not be one by default. :)
[11:22:48] <Protomega> robertmaxrees: I'm an idiot. It's part of an extension for jQuery
[11:23:07] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Hey man
[11:33:50] <vacho> I am looking to create something similar to this, anyone has ideas? https://www.dropbox.com/s/io1tqhyjweqpkoj/Screenshot%202015-06-11%2011.29.22.png?dl=0
[11:34:22] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar do what now?
[11:34:39] <robertmaxrees> hey notchris :)
[11:35:01] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees, I will try something.
[11:35:17] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar what i showed you will work just fine.
[11:36:15] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Happy Thursday!
[11:37:07] <AbuDhar> 	$('<div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="2" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="min-width: 2em; width: 2%;">2%</div>');
[11:37:10] <AbuDhar> can i do this robertmaxrees ?
[11:37:55] <AbuDhar> $('.skill-bar').append('.progress-bar'); and then this
[11:39:59] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar not like that, no.
[11:40:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to create the html from scratch?
[11:40:13] <AbuDhar> yes
[11:40:20] <robertmaxrees> because you'd need to do var $progressBar = $('<div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="2" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="min-width: 2em; width: 2%;">2%</div>');
[11:40:23] <AbuDhar> that was what I was trying to say.
[11:40:30] <robertmaxrees> then $('.skill-bar').append($progressBar);
[11:40:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out some kind of templating system if you're going to be doing a lot of that?
[11:40:44] <robertmaxrees> *.
[11:40:52] <AbuDhar> No no.. It's only for this :)
[11:41:00] <AbuDhar> for now at least.
[11:43:21] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees, works like a charm :) I need to edit some of those values in the in the variable
[11:44:04] <AbuDhar> I have an idea of how it would be done. :) can I try and show you after?
[11:44:20] <AbuDhar> wait for it.
[11:47:14] <ght> I'm am successfully pulling the contents of all values in a table via jquery, and I'd like to determine the vlaues of the header in each column.
[11:47:17] <ght> Here is the jquery: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/03d310213248ea64d52b
[11:47:38] <ght> The values are beeing concatanated into a single string, and, for testing purposes, that string is being posted as an alert
[11:48:27] <NoiseEee> ght: and your issue is?
[11:49:25] <NoiseEee> ght: i mean, *technically* you should be iterating through <thead> only, no?
[11:55:16] <hlvwrk> Hey uhhh
[11:55:31] <hlvwrk> in an if statement, if someone does something like if (!!
[11:55:47] <hlvwrk> what is the two exclamation doing?
[11:57:00] <robertmaxrees> that's trying to coerce to a boolean.
[11:57:27] <hlvwrk> o_O
[11:57:36] <hlvwrk> so something like.... "else if (!!navigator.userAgent.match(/Trident.*rv\:11\./)) {"
[11:57:36] <robertmaxrees> it's a cutesy trick.
[11:57:52] <hlvwrk> what is that actually doing?
[11:57:55] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/784929/what-is-the-not-not-operator-in-javascript
[11:58:20] <ght> NoiseEee: No issues, that's working, but I would like to pull the row header value each time.
[11:58:33] <ght> In that .each loop, to use as an identifer.
[11:58:55] <ght> And I've been trying various code segments I find online to no avail.
[11:59:11] <ght> Wondering if anyone here would know how to pull the header from that column.
[11:59:44] <ght> I mean, column header, obviously. The <th> value.
[12:00:28] <robertmaxrees> have an example of your markup you can pop in a fiddle?
[12:00:46] <hlvwrk> me?
[12:00:51] <robertmaxrees> ght
[12:00:53] <hlvwrk> ah
[12:01:09] <hlvwrk> why did jquery depricate . browser?
[12:01:13] <hlvwrk> :{
[12:01:18] <robertmaxrees> because you shouldn't detect browsers.
[12:01:32] <hlvwrk> but you sometimes need to... :|
[12:01:40] <robertmaxrees> like when?
[12:01:48] <hlvwrk> IE10 encoded URI components differently than IE11.
[12:01:52] <robertmaxrees> because you *should* be doing feature detection, not browser detection.
[12:02:12] <hlvwrk> bah
[12:02:29] <robertmaxrees> plus the number of edge cases are few enough and the abuse was high enough that the feature really didn't need to exist.
[12:02:36] <robertmaxrees> use modernizr if you need anything like that :)
[12:02:40] <ght> robertmaxress: the code is in the gist I posted. Or do you want the html for the table?
[12:02:45] <robertmaxrees> ght the html.
[12:02:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:02:51] <ght> K
[12:02:54] <robertmaxrees> a functioning fiddle is always helpful.
[12:03:32] <ght> True.
[12:04:47] <Mo0O>  hi there, do you know if exist a simple synth for playing dirty guitare, piano and other midi sound?
[12:05:04] <robertmaxrees> Mo0O wrong channel?
[12:05:38] <Mo0O> robertmaxrees: I'm looking for a javascript solution, jquery is one option
[12:05:58] <robertmaxrees> i doubt you'll find any jquery plugins that do what you want.  i'd check out ##javascript.
[12:06:23] <Mo0O> ok, I'm going right now
[12:06:28] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I’m having a hard time get using $.get
[12:06:42] <notchris> I want to emulate a login form on a different site, CORS is allowed
[12:06:51] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[12:06:54] <robertmaxrees> good luck on that.
[12:06:56] <notchris> All the required parameters are there
[12:07:07] <notchris> And the request goes through, but does not log me in
[12:07:16] <robertmaxrees> sounds like an issue on the remote server.
[12:08:04] <hlvwrk> Hey uhhhh. If I wanted to, how would I detect if somebody was using the new Spartan browser using jQuery or Javascript?
[12:08:04] <hlvwrk> >;/
[12:08:19] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk check google.
[12:08:23] <hlvwrk> i have.
[12:08:24] <robertmaxrees> no idea what their UA is.
[12:08:48] <hlvwrk> sec
[12:09:24] <hlvwrk> "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36 Edge/12.9600"
[12:09:43] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to detect edge in the first place?
[12:09:46] <hlvwrk> I imagine the Edge/12* would be sufficient
[12:09:58] <NoiseEee> well there you go, a perfect example of why UA's don't reflect what browser they are ^^
[12:10:02] <robertmaxrees> and i'd go for Edge/number
[12:10:09] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: how long until chrome/etc add "Edge" you think?
[12:10:16] <hlvwrk> Errrrrrrr
[12:10:19] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:10:23] <robertmaxrees> don't detect browsers.
[12:10:42] <hlvwrk> I'm not sure how to go about this then.
[12:10:47] <cardguy1000_> Is there an event for when an option is selected.  So for example lets say that a person already selected option 1, leaving the select box on Option 1 and firing a change event.  Now user clicks the dropdown and selects the already selectied option 1.  The change event wont occur since it’s already selected
[12:11:07] <robertmaxrees> cardguy1000_ right - nothing changed.  why would you respond to that?
[12:11:22] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: and again the question is, why do you "need to" know what browser?
[12:12:23] <robertmaxrees> i am so bummed i have to miss jquerysf this year.
[12:12:26] <notchris> hlvwrk: You could ask the user if they are using Spartan?
[12:12:38] <notchris> ;)
[12:12:41] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[12:15:01] <hlvwrk> uhhhh
[12:15:04] <hlvwrk> lol
[12:15:47] <hlvwrk> Spartan doesn't like the way we're encoding our basic auth login
[12:15:50] <hlvwrk> basically.
[12:15:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[12:16:09] <notchris> Why not just tell users to use a different browser until their is better detection support
[12:16:12] <robertmaxrees> how are you doing it?  can you fix it in a way that'll work in ALL browsers?
[12:16:21] <robertmaxrees> notchris that's a terrible idea imo.
[12:16:34] <notchris> Why?
[12:16:41] <robertmaxrees> "hey we won't support your browser so use something else." - plenty of cases where this can't be followed.
[12:16:46] <hlvwrk> lol
[12:17:55] <hlvwrk> we need to move away from basic auth is our big issue... but just in the scope of things, we can't just yet.
[12:17:57] <hlvwrk> Meh
[12:18:00] <hlvwrk> I'll figure it out
[12:18:13] <NoiseEee> "Spartan doesn't like the way we're encoding our basic auth login"   <--- i'd say others have  probably encountered the same thing, so I'd maybe start googling for Spartan support etc
[12:18:14] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you go with a good cross-browser solution.
[12:18:23] <robertmaxrees> ^ yeah what NoiseEee
[12:18:25] <robertmaxrees> *said
[12:18:52] <AbuDhar> var rating, skill; $progressBar = $('<h2>'+ skill +'</h2><div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="' + rating + '" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="10" style="min-width: 2em; width: 2%;">' + rating + '</div>');
[12:18:59] <AbuDhar> I thought I could do this robertmaxrees
[12:19:07] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar please make a fiddle.
[12:19:08] <AbuDhar> and then assign values to the vars in the .done function
[12:19:10] <AbuDhar> sure.
[12:24:06] <AbuDhar> I am trying myself. It's like maybe I see the problem :)
[12:25:01] <robertmaxrees> cool
[12:25:18] <robertmaxrees> that's half of why we ask for those examples?
[12:25:24] <cardguy1000_> robertmaxrees: The reason I was responding it is because when I go back to my homepage in jquery mobile it remember the last selection and selecting is what caused the page to change.  I think i need to just revert the selection to the placeholder value on change
[12:25:44] <robertmaxrees> cardguy10 either that or detect the value on pageload.
[12:28:14] <AbuDhar> now I am getting a 405 error. Great!
[12:28:22] <robertmaxrees> AbuDhar huh?
[12:28:38] <AbuDhar> yeah I don't know why it happened suddenly. :/
[12:29:01] <AbuDhar> It's thinking I am sending a get request
[12:29:02] <AbuDhar> MethodNotAllowedHttpException in RouteCollection.php line 207:
[12:29:06] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with your quesion...
[12:29:38] <seanz1> Can someone tell me why a jQuery plugin defined on $.fn wouldn't be available on the $ object directly?
[12:29:50] <seanz1> That is happening to me on a page I'm working on for some reason.
[12:30:08] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to use it before it's added.
[12:30:10] <robertmaxrees> bad scope.
[12:30:15] <robertmaxrees> multiple versions of jquery are getting loaded.
[12:30:34] <robertmaxrees> the external plugin is actually 404ing.
[12:30:38] <robertmaxrees> uuuuh... some others.
[12:31:09] <seanz1> robertmaxrees: There are multiple versions of jQuery being loaded.
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> seanz1 that't do it.
[12:31:21] <seanz1> The second one is calling noConflict(true);
[12:31:23] <robertmaxrees> *that'd
[12:31:37] <robertmaxrees> right - which relinquishes control back to the original version
[12:31:38] <robertmaxrees> only load one.
[12:32:02] <seanz1> The original version is the one with the plugin defined on it.
[12:32:06] <seanz1> Why wouldn't that work?
[12:32:10] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:32:22] <robertmaxrees> you're loading two versions.  things won't work correctly without extra wrangling.
[12:32:29] <robertmaxrees> and even then it's a bad idea.
[12:32:44] <seanz1> Ok. I guess I'll have to bite the bullet and just do it. Nike.
[12:32:50] <seanz1> robertmaxrees: Thank you for confirming.
[12:32:53] <robertmaxrees> it's really not that hard to migrate.
[12:33:07] <robertmaxrees> what versions are you going from/to
[12:33:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:33:30] <seanz1> The versions are both 1.11.x. The problem is one is brought in by a theme and another through requireJS.
[12:33:40] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[12:33:43] <robertmaxrees> then just kill one.
[12:33:46] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[12:34:36] <seanz1> Yes…yes.
[12:34:40] <seanz1> So easy sounding.

[12:40:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:41:21] <Sal> no i mean the (function ... stuff

[12:41:41] <robertmaxrees> JBreit2 that's not entirely accurate.
[12:41:54] <JBreit2> well it does help with that in a good bit of cases
[12:42:01] <Sal> immediately when?
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> Sal when called.
[12:42:07] <Sal> on document ready?
[12:42:08] <JBreit2> immediately
[12:42:15] <robertmaxrees> Sal as soon as the code is run.
[12:42:23] <Sal> oh
[12:42:24] <robertmaxrees> it's to create a single-use scope.
[12:42:28] <JBreit2> if your init file calls it it runs right away
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> !g IIFE ben alman
[12:42:29] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) → http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/

[12:42:36] <JBreit2> when every it is referenced with a call it runs
[12:42:52] <Sal> so, its used only to setup code
[12:42:54] <stoned> Is it advisable to use .get/.post or .ajax instead?
[12:43:05] <JBreit2> what was it called before Alman referred to it as an IIFE?
[12:43:08] <JBreit2> I can't remember
[12:43:08] <Sal> ok, i'll read it
[12:43:19] <JBreit2> IIFE was a more accurate term I know that
[12:43:25] <robertmaxrees> JBreit2 self-executing anonymous function
[12:43:31] <robertmaxrees> stoned .ajax() is what those other two call.
[12:43:35] <robertmaxrees> i prefer using just $.ajax()
[12:43:52] <JBreit2> thats it
[12:44:58] <JBreit2> le sigh. baby won't stay asleep.
[12:45:10] * JBreit2 never gets anything done with a 17 month old around :/

[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[12:59:23] <AbuDhar> what's wrong? :D
[12:59:23] <robertmaxrees> var progressBar = $(); runs when you define it.
[12:59:27] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't defer anything.
[12:59:41] <robertmaxrees> also, you need to give your jquery object a single root node.
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> stick the progressbar into the .done();
[13:00:20] <AbuDhar> a single root node?
[13:00:23] <AbuDhar> I did that
[13:00:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.  you have an h2 and a div.
[13:00:41] <robertmaxrees> iirc you need a single element that wraps both.
[13:01:03] <AbuDhar> yeah I have that in my html :P
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> in the jquery object.
[13:01:18] <AbuDhar> oh
[13:01:52] <AbuDhar> can I define that above the .submit() ?
[13:01:56] <AbuDhar> the single root node
[13:02:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:02:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fjhLu3ho/1/
[13:03:02] <robertmaxrees> this is all you need to do.
[13:04:30] <AbuDhar> you forgot to close the root div?
[13:06:03] <AbuDhar> robertmaxrees, :D
[13:06:40] <stoned> http://www.google.com/alerts/feeds/... isn't sending back a response header called Access-Control-Allow-Origin. But on MarijuanaDaily.net using the FeedGet plugin for jqueyr, it's fetching the feed. How is it working there if the server does not send header?
[13:08:59] <robertmaxrees> stoned no clue - i'd have to read the docs for the plugin.
[13:09:08] <stoned> docs are vapid
[13:09:19] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:09:21] <stoned> http://pearljammers.pt/feedget/
[13:09:22] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[13:09:35] <stoned> only versio I can find is minified
[13:09:41] <stoned> and docs dont' tell you how it's being done
[13:09:41] <robertmaxrees> there's even a "try it yourself" on that page.
[13:10:59] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's calling an intermediary.
[13:11:10] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab on the site using this plugin.
[13:11:13] <stoned> I did
[13:11:14] <stoned> nothing

[14:41:59] <tds5016> hi all. I'm using backbone, which should be returning an qXHR on the fetch method.
[14:42:21] <tds5016> I try to run abort of the jqXHR, and it appears as though the method is undefined.
[14:42:29] <tds5016> does anyone know what would cause that?
[14:42:36] <tds5016> or how I would abort the ajax call?
[14:43:31] <tds5016> it appears the jqxhr being returned only gives always, done, final, pipe, progress, promise, state, and then
[14:43:43] <robertmaxrees> those are the deferred methods.
[14:44:41] <tds5016> yup. which makes sense.... but it should also return the jqxhr methods as well, no?
[14:45:17] <Dr-007> what is javascripts equilevant operater as where php uses .= to concat a string
[14:45:19] <tds5016> Backbone.ajax = function() {     return Backbone.$.ajax.apply(Backbone.$, arguments);   };
[14:45:26] <tds5016> that should return a jqxhr, no?
[14:45:36] <robertmaxrees> Dr-007 +
[14:45:38] <tds5016> http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html (gotten from backbone.js btw.)
[14:45:44] <emilkarl> Is there an easy way to determain if an absolute positioned element is placed above a sibling?
[14:46:19] <emilkarl> I have some absolute elements. I want to stack them above each other if they occur on the same X coord.
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 $.ajax does, not sure about your version or backbone.
[14:47:02] <tds5016> Backbone.$  is a reference to $
[14:47:15] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  i'd have to play with it.  what's the issue you're having?
[14:47:48] <tds5016> I need to abort stale fetch requests in backbone if I try to fetch again.
[14:48:07] <robertmaxrees> define "stale"
[14:48:13] <robertmaxrees> because they should just call .fail()
[14:48:29] <tds5016> I send fetch() once, and then before it returns; I send another fetch.
[14:48:45] <tds5016> I want to stop the old fetch, and only worry about the new one.
[14:49:01] <Dr-007> robertmaxrees, that does not work
[14:49:15] <robertmaxrees> Dr-007 there's also +=
[14:49:31] <tds5016> robertmaxrees: will .fail cancel the request?
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 .fail() is called when the request has failed
[14:49:50] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 you keep talking about "stale" requests - why are they still running?
[14:49:56] <tds5016> I don't want to fail the request...
[14:50:02] <tds5016> I want to stop the request from happening?
[14:50:03] <Dr-007> that works, thanks
[14:50:11] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 calling fail doesn't fail it - fail is called when it has failed.
[14:50:19] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't making sense, tds5016.  can you share a fiddle?
[14:50:24] <robertmaxrees> even if it's non-functioning.
[14:50:30] <tds5016> robertmaxrees: oh, I see... I don't want to fail it...
[14:50:39] <tds5016> request1 is run...
[14:50:39] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 nor can you.
[14:50:45] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting something in your code.
[14:50:48] <tds5016> request2 invalidates the request1
[14:51:01] <tds5016> so I want to cancel request1
[14:51:02] <robertmaxrees> what is this for?
[14:51:33] <tds5016> robertmaxrees: I have some properties I run a fetch on.
[14:51:40] <tds5016> I change said properties, and I fetch again.
[14:51:55] <tds5016> I don't want to old request, in case it finish after the new request.
[14:52:05] <tds5016> to finish the old request*
[14:52:11] <tds5016> because it would give me bad data.
[14:52:34] <robertmaxrees> you want to cancel that request then?
[14:52:40] <robertmaxrees> why not debounce the ajax requests instead?
[14:53:06] <tds5016> debounce?
[14:53:13] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript debounce
[14:53:14] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: JavaScript Debounce Function - David Walsh → http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[14:54:23] <tds5016> oh, I see...
[14:54:28] <tds5016> because I don't want to rate limit only...
[14:54:40] <tds5016> I want to make sure I only get one response.
[14:54:54] <robertmaxrees> right, you want a mechanism to cancel currently-running requests.
[14:55:02] <tds5016> because request one could take 5 minutes and request 2 could take 1.
[14:55:12] <tds5016> if that's the case I end on the data from request 1 and not request 2
[14:55:14] <tds5016> which is not what I want.
[14:55:21] <tds5016> robertmaxrees: yup :-)
[14:55:44] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/446626/923919
[14:55:44] <tds5016> that being said; I probably wanna debounce as well.
[14:56:01] <tds5016> yeah, that doesn't work...
[14:56:09] <robertmaxrees> .abort() doesn't?
[14:56:13] <tds5016> because I'm not getting back a jqxhr with abort existing....
[14:56:23] <tds5016> it should be returning a jqxhr; it's not.
[14:56:24] <robertmaxrees> try using it anyway.
[14:56:28] <tds5016> I did.
[14:56:31] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:56:34] <tds5016> it gives me an undefined function.
[14:56:35] <robertmaxrees> something else is up then.
[14:56:36] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[14:56:44] <tds5016> yeah, that's my problem. lol.
[14:56:54] <robertmaxrees> that's why i asked to see your code ;)
[14:58:20] <tds5016> It's not my code.
[14:58:21] <tds5016> it's backbone.
[14:58:29] <tds5016> http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html
[14:58:34] <tds5016> myModel.fetch();
[14:58:42] <tds5016> myModel.fetch();
[14:58:45] <tds5016> that's my code :-P
[14:59:16] <tds5016> technically it's var = myModel.fetch(); xhr.abort();
[14:59:22] <tds5016> which is the undefined issue :-P
[14:59:26] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[14:59:37] <robertmaxrees> you mean var xhr = myModel.fetch(); xhr.abort(); ?
[14:59:43] <tds5016> yup :-)
[14:59:52] <robertmaxrees> because fetch doesn't seem to return that.
[15:00:28] <tds5016> http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html on the line start with: Backbone.sync = function(method, model, options) {
[15:00:39] <tds5016> that's the method that is running that should be returning the jqXHR
[15:01:50] <tds5016> are you seeing what I'm talking about?
[15:19:01] <charlie_sanders> is there a way to remove class based on a regex ?  I need to  remove 'class-name-X'  where X is some number
[15:21:09] <AbuDhar> where is robert?
[15:21:22] <Robdgreat> o/
[15:21:30] <tds5016> for those of you who were curious btw, I finally figured it out.
[15:21:43] <AbuDhar> Robdgreat, are you robertmaxrees?
[15:21:44] <tds5016> BAckbone.fetch().then() and Backbone.fetch() are not at all the same thing.
[15:21:57] <Robdgreat> AbuDhar: no, but I am Robert
[15:21:59] <tds5016> it converts the jqxhr over to a straight request, it doesn't return the value.
[15:22:05] <tds5016> dammit. lol.
[15:22:25] <Robdgreat> :)
[15:22:53] <AbuDhar> and you are also a jQuery expert? :)
[15:25:15] <Robdgreat> expert? no. competent? possibly.
[15:25:55] <AbuDhar> progressBar = $('<div><h4>'+ skill +'</h4><div class="progress"><div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="' + progressRating + '"aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width:' + progressRating + '%">' + rating + '</div></div></div>');
[15:26:03] <AbuDhar> help me rewrite this so I am not vulnerable for XSS attacks lol
[15:26:38] <AbuDhar> var progress = $('<div/>', { class: 'progress' });
[15:26:43] <AbuDhar> I need something like this
[15:27:16] <AbuDhar> maybe let me try myself and then you can help me if I get stuck ? :)
[15:27:47] <Robdgreat> well ok then.
[15:28:17] <AbuDhar> but don't get mad if I get it wrong, ok ?
[15:35:11] <AbuDhar> Robdgreat, this may take some time. For how long are you here? :)
[15:37:09] <Robdgreat> AbuDhar: I only leave when my server goes down.
[15:37:17] <Robdgreat> so, indefinitely
[15:37:34] <AbuDhar> heh
[15:37:35] <Robdgreat> I'm at the computer all day
[15:37:56] <AbuDhar> nice:)
[15:42:05] <AbuDhar> I can keep chaining the .attr() right? :)
[15:42:41] <AbuDhar> like .attr().attr().attr()
[15:42:42] <AbuDhar> ? :)
[15:42:54] <AbuDhar> of course with key value inside
[15:43:18] <Robdgreat> yeah
[15:43:45] <AbuDhar> great.
[15:51:07] <AbuDhar> I think I solved it Robdgreat  :)
[15:56:14] <Robdgreat> excellent
[15:56:29] <AbuDhar> there is a little problem but I think I can solve that by myself.
[15:58:27] <ght> If I have a two dimensonal array, myarray[][], or more literally an array of arrays, and I want to iterate once per each index of my array, what is the syntax for a .each loop?
[15:58:46] <ght> for example, in Ruby, it would be myarray.each do |array|
[16:15:01] <AbuDhar> Robdgreat, fixed!
[16:15:04] <AbuDhar> bye bye :D
[16:15:18] <AbuDhar> oh wait I promised you to show you the code.
[16:15:50] <AbuDhar> Robdgreat, http://laravel.io/bin/0eeDw :)
[16:15:52] <shoky> ght: myarray.forEach(function(array) { ... })
[16:16:37] <Robdgreat> AbuDhar: where does rating come from?
[16:17:03] <AbuDhar> oh sorry
[16:17:08] <AbuDhar> I didn't paste all the code lol
[16:17:22] <AbuDhar> var rating = data.rating, skill = data.skill, description = data.description;
[16:17:26] <AbuDhar> it comes from here :P
[16:17:46] <Robdgreat> just assessing the degree of potential manipulation
[16:18:25] <Robdgreat> since your concern was xss :)
[16:18:34] <AbuDhar> gotta go now :) Yeah thanks for your concern.
[16:18:42] <AbuDhar> and thanks for your help.
[16:18:43] <Robdgreat> have fun
[16:18:51] <AbuDhar> you too. bye.
[16:25:07] <ght> shoky: Thank you. Would the individual array elements then be referenced via the "array" parameter?
[16:25:15] <ght> such as array[0], array[1], etc.
[16:25:18] <ght> within the loop?
[16:26:12] <ght> Yes, I've got it, thank you.
[17:30:37] <ght> Slightly off-topic, I apologize, but as the guys in #ajax are nearly always idle, I have inserted an ajax POST statement into my jQuery code. Tell me, when an ajax post statement is made, does the post execute client-side? As in, the URL request would come from the user visiting the site's machine?
[17:30:48] <ght> Anyone happen to know?
[17:31:11] <ght> Giving asking in here a shot.
[17:31:47] <robertmaxrees> ght "does it execute client-side"
[17:31:57] <robertmaxrees> you mean "does it execute as if the user hit that page"?
[17:33:11] <ght> Yes, I mean, for example, a user visits the web site and clicks a button that corresponds to some javascript that pulls the current values of a table and sends them to a separate server via an AJAX POST statement.
[17:33:26] <ght> Would the source IP of that ajax post request be that of the user visiting the site?
[17:33:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:33:37] <robertmaxrees> because it's their browser making the request
[17:33:39] <ght> Perfect, that's exactly what I needed to know.
[17:33:43] <ght> Of course, yes, thank you.
[18:06:17] <spottieottie> has anyone here taken DMT
[18:17:03] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/zLywt9sc/ -- really not sure why itsnt working
[18:17:40] <robertmaxrees> .find() is for descendent elements.
[18:17:51] <spottieottie> sup robert
[18:18:05] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 so you'll never reach the element you want.
[18:18:09] <robertmaxrees> hey spottieottie
[18:18:22] <vinex08> let me try closest
[18:18:28] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 that won't work either.
[18:18:36] <robertmaxrees> closest() goes up until it matches something.
[18:19:11] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 can you edit the markup on this at all?
[18:19:17] <robertmaxrees> because there's an easy fix for it if so.
[18:19:44] <vinex08> jsut a min..
[18:21:05] <vinex08> i guess not, becuase teh button is in a different div. then the next div will be the content
[18:22:59] <spottieottie> what is this function trying to do
[18:23:26] <Sal> can i work on a virtual dom and then add the node to the real dom ?
[18:23:37] <robertmaxrees> Sal kind of.
[18:23:52] <robertmaxrees> use fragments instead though.
[18:24:36] <Sal> for example, cre<te a div, apply an ID a class add a child element
[18:24:39] <vinex08> gues i have no choice but to change the markup :(
[18:24:49] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 that's the smart thing to do.
[18:24:56] <Sal> and then when finish, add the entire div to the document
[18:25:01] <robertmaxrees> sal you can do that really easily.
[18:25:27] <Sal> how?
[18:25:29] <vinex08> thanks!
[18:25:45] <Sal> using strings?
[18:25:50] <robertmaxrees> Sal you can pass a string to $() and it'll generate html.
[18:26:05] <spottieottie> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD5s6X56mBs
[18:26:07] <robertmaxrees> you can also pass the node and an object of attribute values.
[18:27:02] <Sal> but it will also add to dom
[18:27:11] <robertmaxrees> a fragment, yes.
[18:27:19] <Sal> i need to add only when i finished creating the node and all its childs
[18:27:22] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to avoid that?
[18:28:58] <Sal> should i just create the entire node in a string and then use html(string) ?
[18:29:06] <Sal> how can i add all at once
[18:29:08] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[18:29:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do this in the first place?
[18:29:24] <robertmaxrees> you realize that using document fragments is fast, right?
[18:29:30] <Sal> lets say i need to add a long list
[18:29:35] <robertmaxrees> sure - use fragments.
[18:29:41] <Sal> ?
[18:29:48] <Sal> what do you mean with that?
[18:29:49] <robertmaxrees> pass a string to $()]
[18:29:53] <robertmaxrees> * $()
[18:30:06] <robertmaxrees> or use the documentFragment api.
[18:30:07] <Sal> what should the string contain?
[18:30:11] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript documentfragment
[18:30:12] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: JavaScript DocumentFragment - David Walsh → http://davidwalsh.name/documentfragment
[18:31:30] <Sal> ok, thats js
[18:31:33] <Sal> and in jquery?
[18:31:37] <Sal> same thing?
[18:31:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.  $() is the jquery way.
[18:31:48] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain how.
[18:32:13] <Sal> you mean that $() replaces document.createDocumentFragment() ?
[18:32:30] <robertmaxrees> i mean go check out the docs - it'll explain it.
[18:32:38] <Sal> ok
[18:35:43] <robertmaxrees> i even had a freebie for him.
[19:31:34] <Voyage> I have a single page that has html, css, and JS. Is there a way to have a button on that page which will, when hit, save that page (with its new state) on the server. By new state I mean that the DOM was changed by JS when user interacted with it. By save I mean save the page with the same  page name so that next time if its opened, its updated. e.g http://mysite.com/mypage.ext   so save it mypage.ext?
[19:36:21] <SirLagz> Voyage: depends on how hackish you're willing to go
[19:36:57] <SirLagz> Voyage: also depends on whether you're going to be using any Server side scripting
[19:45:00] <Voyage> SirLagz,  can it be done without serverside script?
[19:45:47] <SirLagz> Voyage: depends on how hackish and reliable you want it...
[19:45:52] <SirLagz> Voyage: what are you trying to do?
[19:47:28] <Voyage> SirLagz,   just tyring to update page so user gets ukpdated all the time and can update
[19:47:41] <Voyage> I thought JS cannot write files on server?
[19:48:36] <SirLagz> Voyage: JS can't but you can save data like this on the client with cookies
[19:48:45] <SirLagz> Voyage: but that's not reliable.
[19:49:01] <Voyage> hm no. need server side save
[19:49:12] <SirLagz> Voyage: then no, you can
[19:49:14] <SirLagz> can't
[19:49:21] <SirLagz> can't do it without server side scripting of some sort
[19:50:16] <Voyage> ok how to do by server side lag
[19:50:17] <Voyage> lang
[19:50:30] <SirLagz> Voyage: depends on the language then...
[19:50:44] <Voyage> php
[19:51:05] <Voyage> SirLagz,  1) how to send page data to server? 2) how to save it<-- looks simple
[19:52:10] <SirLagz> Voyage: have you googled? Plenty of tutorials out there
[19:53:39] <Voyage> ok. in JS how to get ALL page html,css, JS and send to server?
[19:54:51] <SirLagz> Voyage: have you tried to do anything?
[20:00:06] <Voyage> SirLagz,  no
[20:00:16] <Voyage> because I dont know what to do
[20:00:36] <SirLagz> Voyage: have you googled?
[20:03:58] <Voyage> a bit
[20:07:08] <SirLagz> Voyage: and have you found anything to work off?
[20:31:47] <Voyage> SirLagz,  no
[21:56:41] <JosefDe> Hey guys. I'm having a problem: I'm doing autocomplete, which results in multiple Ajax-Requests. In the done()-callback I write the result into a div via html(). The problem is: If  there are too many Ajax-Requests, it happens, that even though all requests have content in response, the div has no content. Why?
[22:06:49] <JosefDe> Ah I know
[22:06:51] <JosefDe> thanks
[22:22:13] <Voyage> Is there a smart way to get , all html (innerHtml) + state + content (e.g form data) of each element and then duplicate a page?
[22:29:31] <Voyage> How to get innerHtml With state and content of each element inside?
[22:35:06] <arc_> what, like $('html').html(); ?
[22:39:35] <arc_> oh form data
[22:39:38] <arc_> yeah gl w/ that
[22:40:41] <Uhkis> sounds like Voyage is trying to do malware
[22:42:43] <arc_> heh
[22:47:54] <Voyage> arc_,  yes. ALL things in a page
[22:49:09] <arc_> there's no simple way to do that. you'll have to create that functionality yourself
[22:49:38] <arc_> i'm a bit dismayed to see that you can get .val() of a password field though
[22:50:47] <Voyage> so can POST
[22:51:41] <JosefDe> Hey guys. If I focus out of a input field, how can I get the element, which has got the new focus?
[22:52:38] <arc_> $( document.activeElement )
[22:53:01] <JosefDe> I tried that but it doesn't work
[22:53:19] <arc_> what does it return
[22:53:26] <JosefDe> It always returns <body>, even though I clicked on a <span>
[22:54:43] <JosefDe> Even if I click into another input, it always returns <body>
[22:55:56] <arc_> works here
[22:56:45] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/b3ah82d6/
[22:57:10] <arc_> span does not get focus. the document oes
[22:57:11] <arc_> does*
[22:57:19] <arc_> it's the document or an input
[22:57:37] <arc_> if you want to get the object someone clicked on, just create a click event and use $(this)
[22:58:06] <arc_> but that is not focus
[22:59:13] <arc_> actually, it looks like you can allow other elements to get focus:
[22:59:16] <arc_> In recent browser versions, the event can be extended to include all element types by explicitly setting the element's tabindex property.
[22:59:20] <arc_> but you have to do that
[22:59:30] <JosefDe> So how can I fix my problem?
[22:59:34] <JosefDe> I'm confused
[22:59:46] <arc_> you haven't told us what your problem is, just what you're trying to do
[22:59:49] <JosefDe> Normally I would expect the focus to be the newly clicked input, but it's <body>
[22:59:57] <JosefDe> Ok. My problem:
[23:00:05] <arc_> if you look at my fiddle, as long as you're clicking on an input field, it does work
[23:00:26] <JosefDe> I have a pull-down-menu under an input. If the user clicks out of the input-box, I want to hide the pulldown-menu. But:
[23:01:05] <JosefDe> If the user clicks on an item in the pulldown menu, I don't want to react to focusout in this case
[23:01:23] <JosefDe> Instead I want to react to click event on the item in the pulldown menu
[23:01:26] <arc_> you want to leave it open if they click?
[23:01:32] <arc_> on a menu selection?
[23:01:36] <JosefDe> yes
[23:02:04] <arc_> so i assume you already have that part working
[23:02:17] <JosefDe> The problem is: focus event is triggered before the click event of an item. Then in the click-event-handler I try accessing an item, which isn't there anymore, because it's hidden
[23:02:42] <arc_> it should still be there even if it's hidden, unless you are hiding it by deleting it from dom
[23:02:54] <JosefDe> No. I'm just hiding.
[23:02:59] <arc_> can you make a fiddle
[23:03:04] <JosefDe> ok
[23:04:44] <JosefDe> But the fact is again: 1) focusout event is triggered earlier then the click-event. As soon as the menu is hidden, the click goes to <body>, because there is no menu-item anymore
[23:05:16] <JosefDe> If I don't hide the menu, the item is there, and the click event works
[23:05:41] <arc_> you're hiding it when someone clicks anywhere other than on the menu, yes?
[23:05:50] <JosefDe> And therefore there is no other option than turning off hide() at focusout, if an item was clicked and handling everything in the click-event
[23:05:58] <JosefDe> arc_: Exactly
[23:06:12] <arc_> so where do you want the click to go
[23:06:34] <arc_> or what do you want to happen that isn't happening
[23:07:50] <JosefDe> arc_: I want the click to go to the clicked menu item.
[23:07:58] <JosefDe> What I want:
[23:08:23] <JosefDe> That I can check inside my focus-eventhandler if an item was clicked.
[23:08:30] <JosefDe> And then don't hide menu
[23:10:44] <arc_> ok ... so you want to click to open the menu. if they click anywhere in the menu, don't hide it on that click, or any other click after that? only hide if they open the menu, but don't click anything?
[23:11:37] <arc_> you're probably making this more complicated than it needs to be
[23:12:01] <JosefDe> arc_: No: It is an autocomplete-menu which shows items, as soon as the user types in things. Then I want this: 1) If the user clicks outside the input-box and menu --> hide menu. If the user clicks on an item in the  menu --> don't hide menu, but react to click-event on menu-item
[23:12:11] <JosefDe> arc_: So what should I do?
[23:13:47] <arc_> i don't know. every time you describe this it sounds different from the last time. if you could just make a fiddle it would be a lot easier to understand
[23:15:27] <arc_> i don't understand why it needs to be a focus event at all, rather than just a click event
[23:15:53] <JosefDe> Ok. Thanks. I just try to fix it myself.
[23:16:11] <JosefDe> I described my problem very detailed.. But never mind
[23:17:04] <arc_> it's one thing to describe your problem. i have no idea what your code is
[23:17:19] <arc_> how can i tell you what to do within the confines of how you have created your menu
[23:18:07] <arc_> people don't solve problems in exactly the same way every time
[23:18:43] <arc_> i don't see what's so hard about making a fiddle, but if you don't want to, that's fine
[23:20:44] <arc_> there's a reason they wrote this http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[23:29:09] <JosefDe> Man.. it's just $('.myclass:focus'). What a big science to talk half an hour about..
[23:30:54] <arc_> that doesn't do what you asked for, it does something else
[23:31:17] <arc_> but if you solved your problem by using that, that's good
[23:35:44] <JosefDe> No it didn't solve it. I'm under time pressure..
