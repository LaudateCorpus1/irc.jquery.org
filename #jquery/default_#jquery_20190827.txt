[00:36:02] <mducharme> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to do multi filter select (https://datatables.net/examples/api/multi_filter_select.html) with a php laravel backend with server side processing
[00:37:18] <mducharme> when saveState is true and you navigate away from the page and back again, it does the query for the drop down based on the previously used filters, and the result is that instead of showing all options in the drop down it only shows the last selected one
[00:38:28] <mducharme> I'm not sure yet exactly whether the solution is on the javascript side or the php side
[00:39:09] <robertmaxrees> so your issue is, when the user presses back, form controls are in their last state?
[00:39:19] <robertmaxrees> and you want them to return back to their defaults?
[00:43:52] <mducharme> datatables has a feature called saveState where when that is set to true it stores the last settings in a cookie or something so when you revisit the page it uses the old settings.. when the page initially loads with the saveState then the drop down list for filtering is artificially limited based on the previous state due to the serverSide processing
[00:44:14] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[00:44:22] <mducharme> I can turn off saveState and that makes everything work but the page is less usable then
[00:44:41] <mducharme> I tried turning off the serverSide processing but it doesn't seem to work  with client side processing
[00:48:17] <mducharme> the problem is that I'm using one library that uses another library that uses another library that finally makes the datatables call
[00:49:07] <mducharme> so when something doesn't work (like now) it is hard to figure out where the problem actually is
[00:54:57] <robertmaxrees> honestly, i'd ask in the datatables forums at this point.
[00:55:03] <robertmaxrees> since you're pretty far away from jquery territory .
[01:34:33] <mducharme> yes, I agree, I already asked there
[01:34:49] <robertmaxrees> rad :) good luck!
[01:35:06] <mducharme> I also created an issue with the second level library, because I think that's where the problem is, at least that's the one most likely to be able to help
[07:54:00] <eoli3n> Hi
[07:54:25] <eoli3n> http://ix.io/1TBl
[07:54:31] <eoli3n> i wrote this which works
[07:54:49] <eoli3n> problem is that in css, i cant use #0 : an id cannot be numeric
[07:55:07] <eoli3n> so i need a new method to select my <li>,
[07:55:20] <eoli3n> first the first one, then the next one, then the next one...
[07:55:24] <eoli3n> what should i use ?
[07:55:36] <thykka> id can be a number
[07:55:40] <thykka> classes can't
[07:55:45] <eoli3n> oh
[07:56:08] <eoli3n> so i didn't understand the answer... on #php
[07:56:15] <eoli3n> where does i use numeric class ?
[07:56:32] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/hLus0mbq/4
[07:56:36] <Cork> it used to not be allowed to use numbers in ids
[07:56:51] <Cork> but that was quite a while ago; no browser has ever required it
[07:57:06] <Cork> (but old validators might still complain about it)
[07:57:21] <thykka> Still, even though it *can* be just a number, I would prefer a more descriptive name
[07:57:46] <eoli3n> yep but in my case, number is better ,if its ok, then lets keep it
[07:58:04] <eoli3n> i'm reading your answer on #css
[07:58:12] <Cork> if it is for a loop you could just prefix it
[07:58:18] <eoli3n> prefix it ?
[07:58:22] <Cork> "row" + index
[07:58:27] <Cork> for example
[07:58:29] <eoli3n> oh, nice trick
[07:58:34] <eoli3n> thx lets do this
[07:58:45] <Cork> it makes the id more unique so easier to handle
[07:58:54] <Cork> remember ids needs to be unique on the entire page
[07:59:05] <eoli3n> it will
[07:59:07] <eoli3n> :)
[07:59:09] <Cork> if you ever have two elements with the same id you will have problem
[08:03:27] <eoli3n> fixed with prefix
[08:03:36] <eoli3n> its solved my issue in jsfiddle
[08:03:50] <thykka> it wasn't broken yet, so you pre-fixed it ;)
[08:04:33] <Cork> ++thykka
[08:04:41] <eoli3n> problem is that i copy/pasted from chrome to jsfiddle, its works in jsfiddle, not in chrome
[08:04:44] <eoli3n> ahahah
[08:05:07] <eoli3n> no no, it works, i'm blind that's all
[08:05:15] <Cork> eoli3n: doesn't work is one of the most worthless comments
[08:05:22] <Cork> it doesn't tell anything
[08:05:51] <eoli3n> please dont be rude :)
[08:05:56] <Cork> 1. doesn't it render correctly? or 2. it doesn't execute correctly (js) or 3. doesn't function or 4. results in error or....
[08:06:02] <Cork> eoli3n: i wasn't
[08:06:11] <thykka> not rude, just a blunt fact
[08:06:14] <eoli3n> Cork: i was talking about my first problem
[08:06:19] <eoli3n> but anything its solved
[08:07:18] <eoli3n> the last thing is : https://jsfiddle.net/afnmLzc7/
[08:07:40] <eoli3n> how to make working class more important than id rules
[08:07:42] <eoli3n> i mean
[08:07:56] <eoli3n> when i add .progressbar li.active:before
[08:08:14] <eoli3n> i want it to override #progressliX content
[08:08:21] <Cork> eoli3n: you can't
[08:08:37] <Cork> css diktate that rules are appliced in specificy order
[08:08:52] <Cork> so id > class > attribute > element
[08:09:02] <eoli3n> arrr
[08:09:23] <Cork> you only option is to do #row0.progressbar or similar
[08:09:36] <eoli3n> please explain ?
[08:09:42] <eoli3n> #row0.progressbar ?
[08:09:52] <Cork> ya, have the id+class as a selector
[08:10:01] <Cork> or don't use id for styling
[08:10:16] <Cork> have two classes for all styling (i would recommend this)
[08:10:33] <eoli3n> if i don't use id : how to select specific li to set a specific icon ?
[08:10:41] <Cork> don't
[08:10:51] <eoli3n> i want to
[08:10:56] <Cork> have like .iconname.progressbar
[08:11:07] <Cork> and let the .iconname class set the icon
[08:11:16] <Cork> then you don't need to set it specifically in the css
[08:11:24] <eoli3n> i think i don't understand something
[08:11:58] <eoli3n> how .iconname class could know which icon apply to first li, then next then next ?
[08:12:08] <Cork> <li class="progress letter"></li> css: .letter { content: "something"; } .progressbar { the styling }
[08:12:25] <Cork> (psudo code ofcource)
[08:12:48] <eoli3n> ok you mean working only with class
[08:12:53] <eoli3n> i think i get what you mean lets try
[08:12:54] <Cork> yes
[08:13:02] <eoli3n> use class as i use ids
[08:13:06] <Cork> it is usally simpler to do it that way
[08:13:08] <Cork> no
[08:13:11] <Cork> i don't mean that
[08:13:26] <Cork> i mean use classes with names specifying what you want them to do
[08:13:37] <Cork> not to specify what element you want it to happen on
[08:13:40] <eoli3n> yep but my <li> are dynamic
[08:13:44] <eoli3n> lets paste something
[08:13:54] <Cork> ya, so?
[08:13:59] <eoli3n> http://ix.io/1TBn
[08:14:06] <eoli3n> so i cannot name specificly
[08:14:12] <eoli3n> but i have the idea now i think
[08:14:13] <Cork> if it is really dynamic and the generation has no stylin knowlage, why not just use :nth-child() ?
[08:14:15] <eoli3n> maybe you will correct me
[08:14:29] <eoli3n> because i never heard of it
[08:17:23] <Cork> ok the just use .progressbar:nth-child(1) to style the first element and :nth-child(2) for the second and so on
[08:17:36] <Cork> and you don't need any uniq data on the li element at all
[08:18:38] <eoli3n> .progressbar li:nth-child(1):before
[08:18:41] <eoli3n> worked
[08:19:52] <eoli3n> everything works now
[08:19:58] <eoli3n> thx a lot Cork <3
[08:20:03] <Cork> np
[08:21:04] <Cork> man cleaning up old fixtures has to be the most brain killing task there is...
[08:22:58] <undefined_bob> what kind of "old fixtures"?
[08:23:17] <Cork> old rails test fixtures
[08:23:28] <Cork> it has 5 different date time formats...
[08:23:41] <Cork> some are even wrong (wrong timezone, or rather unspecified)
[08:24:29] <undefined_bob> sounds annoying
[08:24:39] <undefined_bob> can you outsource it to india?
[08:24:58] <Cork> lol
[08:25:19] <Cork> na, its just me gerring annoied enough to finaly fix the damn thing
[08:25:48] <undefined_bob> many lines?
[08:26:05] <Cork> its the entire fixture suite...
[08:26:10] <Cork> what do you think?
[08:32:13] <undefined_bob> sounds like too much
[08:33:06] <Cork> most of it can be fixed with simple search and replace
[09:02:10] <eoli3n> Cork another little thing : https://jsfiddle.net/afnmLzc7/1/
[09:02:26] <eoli3n> i can't find why progress bar and msg are not center the same way
[09:02:43] <Cork> search for css absolute center
[09:03:10] <eoli3n> ok
[09:03:12] <eoli3n> thx
[09:05:05] <Cork> hmm that site seams to have been removed...
[09:05:43] <Cork> eoli3n: use position: absolute left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);
[09:05:53] <Cork> that will position the element perfectly in the middle
[09:07:10] <eoli3n> hmmm
[09:07:16] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/afnmLzc7/2/
[09:07:33] <eoli3n> .container and ".isa_info, .isa_success, .isa_warning, .isa_error"
[09:08:44] <Cork> ya, that isn't for centering the entire page
[09:08:54] <Cork> as it will lift it out of the flow
[09:09:13] <Cork> especially as you have a fixed width of the page
[09:09:16] <eoli3n> i just want to align my 2 elements the same way
[09:09:38] <eoli3n> i will play with padding
[09:10:36] <Cork> you shouldn't use fixed width like you are
[09:10:55] <Cork> it will cause this kind of problem (especially if you ever get a use that don't have the font you're using)
[09:11:12] <Cork> instead let the text kictate the site and add margin around that
[09:11:20] <Cork> and then center each element on the place it should be
[09:11:37] <Cork> then the element can wiggle around to take the space it need and things will not break so easily
[09:11:41] <eoli3n> i used this exemple http://kodhus.com/newsite/step-progress-bar-css-only/
[09:11:48] <eoli3n> are you talking abut .container width ?
[09:11:50] <eoli3n> about
[09:12:07] <Cork> almost the entire css scheat is full of it
[09:12:45] <Cork> though those questions should prob be taken in #css instead of here
[09:12:57] <eoli3n> yes sorry
[09:13:00] <Cork> (as it seams to have nothing to do with jquery)
[13:01:20] <Guest8> I'm hoping this is a quick and simple answer, but I am checking my form on submission and highlight any fields with a different background color, and at the end put up a message through confirm() about it. In that message I say the fields have been highlighted but that doesn't actually happen until the confirm choice has been made. How can I ensure
[13:01:20] <Guest8>  the background color change has gone through before I prompt the user with my confirm() choice?
[13:02:08] <robertmaxrees> Guest52 put your logic for highlights before the call to confirm()
[13:02:21] <robertmaxrees> DOM operations are synchronous.
[13:03:12] <robertmaxrees> err, Guest8
[13:03:18] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete.
[13:04:06] <Guest8> I believe I'm doing that, the highlights are done through a $('selector').each() call and then after that, if a bool has been set to true (indicating fields need attention) I put up the confirm dialog
[13:04:14] <robertmaxrees> then show code.
[13:04:21] <robertmaxrees> 'cause otherwise it's a guessing game :)
[13:04:32] <robertmaxrees> a test case in jsfiddle would be awesome
[13:05:12] <Guest8> Putting that together right now, shouldn't be long
[13:05:16] <robertmaxrees> rad
[13:05:54] <Guest8> Hmm, how do I actually get a link to share from jsfiddle?
[13:06:45] <Guest8> https://jsfiddle.net/e49fzthd/
[13:06:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:07:06] <robertmaxrees> so how do I replicate the issue?
[13:07:39] <Guest8> After you click 'do the thing' I go through and make my background color changes, and then after I prompt the user with confirm() but they have not gone through yet
[13:07:50] <robertmaxrees> what browser?
[13:07:52] <Guest8> Only after I hit OK or cancel do I see the color change
[13:07:53] <robertmaxrees> it's working fine here.
[13:08:24] <Guest8> Chrome Version 76.0.3809.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)
[13:08:32] <robertmaxrees> lol can just say chrome =)
[13:08:50] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  chrome is bugged here.
[13:09:13] <Guest8> OK, yes I see it working fine in firefox too
[13:09:40] <Guest8> Maybe I should do a micro sleep type thing before prompting the user with confirm?
[13:09:45] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[13:09:50] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid those.
[13:10:35] <Guest8> Is there a better option for chrome users?
[13:10:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking into it now :)
[13:10:48] <Guest8> Oh cool, thanks
[13:12:06] <robertmaxrees> actually, any reason you're not using a modal here instea?
[13:12:09] <robertmaxrees> *instead
[13:12:39] <Guest8> No good reason, no
[13:13:59] <Guest8> I'll switch to a modal for this then, thanks
[13:14:15] <robertmaxrees> that way you don't lock the browser.  also cleaner overall UI.
[15:49:09] <bgilb> when using $.when how can i set it up so some may fail, but continue anyways? i've tried .then and .done but neither work. When it hits a 404 it just fails
[15:49:25] <robertmaxrees> you can't use $.when
[15:49:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:49:47] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to setup something custom for that.
[15:53:21] <bgilb> https://pastebin.com/KXEHg0ZT
[15:53:26] <bgilb> i found a .all() thing
[15:53:46] <bgilb> i dunno what to setup lol. the number of request i could have is arbitrary
[15:54:02] <bgilb> i guess i could have some recursive thing. seems like jquery should have something for this?
[15:54:20] <bgilb> it works how i expect if they're all successful
[15:55:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:55:11] <bgilb> y you laugh
[16:02:48] <robertmaxrees> read the docs on promise.all
[16:02:50] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:04:24] <bgilb> ty
[16:04:33] <bgilb> are when -> promise.all the same?
[16:04:34] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to do what you want.
[16:05:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:08:35] <robertmaxrees> bgilb you want to know when all promises have resolved or rejected, right?
[16:10:26] <bgilb> i want .then to fire regardless of rejections
[16:10:37] <robertmaxrees> then you need https://davidwalsh.name/promises-results
[16:10:38] <bgilb> and array items to just be missing, or have like result: "fail" instead
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> though I would question why you have failing calls in the first place.
[16:11:28] <bgilb> depends on client and their setup, its possible to rename a URL and my app not to know
[16:11:38] <shoky_> bgilb: you could just make them not reject, by resolving with {result: "fail"} or whatever you want
[16:11:48] <bgilb> how do i do that?
[16:12:01] <bgilb> should i add a $.get().catch() ?
[16:12:13] <shoky_> yep with .catch()
[16:12:24] <bgilb> excellent
[16:12:31] <shoky_> if you return a value from .catch(), the returned promise will resolve with that value
[16:13:07] <bgilb> ohh okay
[16:13:16] <bgilb> so do like return { result: 'fail' }
[16:13:46] <shoky_> ya
[16:14:38] <bgilb> $.get().catch is not a function
[16:14:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:14:58] <robertmaxrees> wjat version of jquery are you using?
[16:14:59] <bgilb> do i need to build a manual $.ajax ?
[16:15:00] <shoky_> not jquery 3?
[16:15:23] <bgilb> 2.2.3
[16:15:32] <bgilb> unfortunately whatever these shops have installed -_-
[16:15:40] <robertmaxrees> "these shops
[16:15:42] <robertmaxrees> "??
[16:15:49] <shoky_> before jq3 jquery's promises are not compliant with standard promises
[16:15:53] <shoky_> so no .catch()
[16:15:54] <robertmaxrees> are you building a widget or a plugin or something?
[16:15:54] <bgilb> crap
[16:15:59] <bgilb> yeah its a widget
[16:16:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:16:03] <bgilb> aka hell
[16:16:08] <robertmaxrees> dudski
[16:16:13] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery for that.
[16:16:27] <bgilb> well i can enforce > some version
[16:16:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:16:42] <bgilb> could i still use $.ajax and manually specify the catch?
[16:16:53] <robertmaxrees> you're being super heavy-handed.
[16:16:59] <bgilb> how so
[16:17:05] <robertmaxrees> use normal ol' JS and compile down to ES5
[16:17:15] <bgilb> like babel ?
[16:17:18] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:17:49] <robertmaxrees> i've seen vendors require companies (like mine) to try to fulfill on some kind of requirement like that and it never ends well.
[16:18:16] <bgilb> well we can manually load jquery, so we enforce > 1.9
[16:18:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:18:25] <robertmaxrees> and then you break the client's page/.
[16:18:27] <bgilb> the shops just don't like it when their shop loads like 9 jquerys
[16:18:31] <bgilb> no we use noconflict
[16:18:44] <bgilb> its a nightmare but works
[16:18:45] <robertmaxrees> noconflict doesn't guarantee that you won't break anything ;)
[16:18:52] <robertmaxrees> but hey, what would i know
[16:20:07] <bgilb> we haven't had any issues
[16:20:18] <robertmaxrees> yet, that you know of :)
[16:20:31] <bgilb> we'd be getting lots of calls since app developers usually get blamed first
[16:20:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:20:58] <robertmaxrees> anyway, like shoky_ pointed out, need a newer version of jquery.
[16:21:02] <bgilb> okay
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> but also, to use native promises, you'll need to cross-compile down depending on browser support.
[16:21:23] <bgilb> i figured
[16:21:37] <robertmaxrees> what all are you using jquery for?
[16:22:21] <bgilb> just random things like find the widgets, making ajax calls
[16:22:46] <bgilb> it would have probably been simpler to just not use jquery from the start lol
[16:22:48] <shoky_> bgilb: i think instead of .catch() you could use .then(null, function(err) { return $.Deferred().resolve({result: 'fail'}) })
[16:22:52] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might not need it in the first place :) document.querySelectorAll and fetch can do both of those pretty easily.
[16:23:21] <bgilb> okay ill try that and other things
[16:23:40] <bgilb> * bangs head *
[16:24:48] <bgilb> i wish shopify had put together some version management for all the scripts these different apps load
[16:26:44] <bgilb> shoky_, that worked
[16:27:22] <shoky_> cool
