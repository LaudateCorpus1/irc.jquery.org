[06:15:33] <Mark___> could anyone tell me why this text input form doesn’t take english letters? also it won’t let me erase what has been typed. http://madidea.cafe24.com/
[06:21:04] <shoky> Mark___: because there's a preventDefault() on keypress event
[06:21:42] <Mark___> oh.
[06:21:52] <Mark___> can you tell me where that code is located?
[06:22:21] <shoky> in the part of your code that has a keypress listener for #search-box > .search-input
[06:23:06] <Mark___> i’ll check that. thanks
[07:12:47] <Psychiatrist> Hey guys. I'm having problems with using AJAX to repopulate a selection. It basically works but as in the values get repopulated but the previous selection is still shown after the list gets repopulated -- I use this to clear the list: $("#<selection id>").empty();
[07:13:39] <Psychiatrist> I've tried .removeOption(0); or .html(null) to no avail
[07:16:35] <GuessX> Psychiatrist, put up some sample code in jsfiddle etc
[07:22:38] <Psychiatrist> GuessX, This is the pretty much it: https://jsfiddle.net/hprfhkvg/ . The idea is when the first selectionlist selection changes the other selection gets repopulated - that works. The problem is that the previously selected value is still shown even after the repopulation.
[07:26:57] <shoky> Psychiatrist: looks fine https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hprfhkvg/1/
[07:31:40] <Psychiatrist> Thanks a lot! I guess it might be because of the fancy select2 , maybe it somehow retains the selected value or maybe it is because I'm giving in a whole list of values initially when the page loads that aren't connected to the selectionbox1 selected value. At least I'm not drawing dead. Thanks again!
[07:34:34] <shoky> Psychiatrist: you can try to .trigger('change') on the select to make select2 see the changes
[07:34:57] <shoky> if all else fails you can re-initialize select2 i guess
[07:38:15] <Psychiatrist> shoky, Thank you so much! The .trigger('change') works! Woo
[08:11:45] <pytony> Hi
[08:12:33] <pytony> Is `$(x).html($(y).html())` asynchroneous?
[08:13:12] <pytony> If so, how can I run code when it is completed?
[08:13:19] <decx> it's not
[08:20:19] <pytony> decx: My actual code looks like this: https://bpaste.net/show/29dee95b352b However, after this code ran, ".next" bloc gets the content of ".prev" instead of ".cur".
[08:22:34] <pytony> just as if `$('.cur').html($('.prev').html())` was executed before `$('.next').html($('.cur').html())`
[08:23:01] <decx> what's it you'r trying to do here
[08:25:30] <pytony> I have 3 blocs, and want to shift them left or right when clicking some buttons
[08:26:23] <pytony> funny enough I have this code that does the same work in the other direction, and it works perfectly https://bpaste.net/show/ab45e5440c4a
[08:33:59] <pytony> Forget it, it looks like the problem is at another level in my source code, I'll figure it out
[10:05:07] <Alex11223|2> Why jQuery mobile vclick (and tap) "ghostclicks"? At least in Chrome mobile emulator. I have a button, and I hide it and replace with another button (.hide, .show) when clicked. But the second receives click too.

[10:49:05] <fas3r> I use select2 with ajax, it's working fine. When making a ajax call, I return an extra value to select2 that I manage to add in select2 data array using the processResults function. However, when submitting the form, I would like ajax to send the extra field. Is there a way to do so or I need build my own "array" ?
[11:03:20] <Shadow> Hi where have I gone wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/tVSv9/140/ When I change tabs in the first group of tabs they change correctly. When I change in the second group, the first ones change.
[11:05:33] <shoky> Shadow: you have duplicate id's, that's not valid
[11:06:54] <Shadow> shoky: what id needs to be changed, please
[11:07:25] <shoky> Shadow: all the id's of the tabs. the second group has the same id's for the tabs as the first group
[11:20:30] <Shadow> shoky: thank you.

[13:10:06] <Kiki37_> Is it possible to select an element like that : $('select[name="country"]').next('span')

[13:10:36] <Kiki37_> I want to add a class to the span after the select
[13:11:03] <arc_> actually no
[13:11:45] <arc_> well, i guess i'm not positive. it seems like it probably would work
[13:11:55] <Kiki37_> so this will not work ? : $('select[name="country"]').next('span').addClass('error');
[13:12:10] <z1haze> where is the span
[13:12:21] <Kiki37_> just after the select
[13:12:27] <arc_> yes it will work
[13:18:49] <Kiki37_> It's not working :-(
