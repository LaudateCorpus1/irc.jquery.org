[00:50:44] <physikoi> Hello #jquery. I'm using squarespace for a project. Unfortunately, squarespace says there's no way to disable requests to typekit.net. Is there some jquery-ish way to block these requests? ty
[10:24:44] <d3m0n> Anyone see an obvious reason why I am getting the "z" variable returned as a null? https://codepen.io/jstn/pen/EwVYow

[16:46:17] <gajus> Is there something similar to nextUntil that would find any node in DOM after the specific node matching a selector?
[16:46:32] <gajus> I want to extract IMDb URL from a movie page, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_3
[16:47:16] <gajus> The markup differs quite a bit from page to page. Therefore, I need a solution a la $('h2:contains(External links)').findNext('a[href*=imdb]')
[16:47:21] <gajus> is there something like findNext?
[16:49:38] <pavonia> If they are on the same level, you could try "h2 ~ a"
[16:49:54] <pavonia> same level = have the same parent node
[16:50:19] <gajus> problem is that there are elements in between (sometimes)
[16:51:15] <pavonia> That doesn't matter
[16:51:40] <gajus> Oh, you are right.
[16:51:47] <gajus> Thank you. That will work.
[16:52:17] <gajus> `h2:contains(External links) ~ ul a[href*="imdb"]` perfect
[18:07:46] <jak2000> hi blindMoe
[18:08:27] <blindMoe> Can anyone recommend a newish / good parallax script to use?  I have gone through about 20 and all seem to have their quirks.  Using parallax.js right now for simple background scrolling but it tends to render funky and has a lot of resize issues
[18:08:58] <blindMoe> kind of tired of digging through the thousand options and not finding one that doesn't have its' issues
[19:22:13] <jq> Can I do $("selector").find('input').each(....etc... ?
[19:22:23] <jq> Cause it doesnt' seem to work
[19:23:40] <jq> Wait, can't I just do $("selector input").each
[19:23:41] <jq> Doh
[20:08:25] <pachet> jq: those two should have the same result
[22:00:48] <Anthaas> Hi - can anyone help me with the jquery validation library?
