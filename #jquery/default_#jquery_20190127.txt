[17:13:49] <doggo> can anyone help? ^
[19:37:09] <jak2000> hi all
[20:10:58] <robertmaxrees> weee
[20:31:41] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!
[20:31:49] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:34:00] <jak2000> i use java for webdev, and set session time... is session time expire. i redirect to login.jsp   but only only when user interact with the webage.... with Jquery how to do same? but automatically redirect to login.jsp?  (each user have 3 minutes of inactivity, other 5, other 30 ) any advice?
[20:34:18] <robertmaxrees> that's not a job for jquery.
[20:34:37] <jak2000> javascript?
[20:34:41] <jak2000> or?
[20:34:43] <robertmaxrees> have your server check that at the beginning of the request - if the user's timed out, redirect them there.
[20:34:57] <robertmaxrees> your backend.  not your frontend.
[20:35:02] <jak2000> yes i can do.. but...
[20:35:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:35:47] <jak2000> i display a Html table with 100 records.... the time finish (the session expired.....)
[20:35:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:36:01] <jak2000> id user NOT press F5 or back or press any button, him not see any error right?
[20:36:09] <jak2000> *if
[20:36:12] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[20:36:26] <robertmaxrees> let's back way up
[20:36:37] <robertmaxrees> why are you timing them out?  is it sensitive data that you're showing?
[20:36:43] <jak2000> yes
[20:37:14] <robertmaxrees> okay, so if you rely on js to handle your timeouts, i could very easily circumvent that logic.  which is bad.
[20:37:14] <jak2000> i want: if have an Inactivity of 3 minutes i want hide Data or redirect to login.jsp
[20:37:17] <jak2000> the client need this...
[20:37:32] <jak2000> yes i know is bad and, expensive
[20:37:34] <robertmaxrees> fix your server-side to handle the redirect on a new request.  then handle your idle page concept.
[20:39:11] <jak2000> Java:HttpSession.setMaxInactiveInterval()   i setup here the maxInteractiveInterval.
[20:39:21] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[20:39:29] <jak2000> and work.... but the page continue ilde or wait a user interact....
[20:39:39] <jak2000> the page continue, displaying HTML table data :(
[20:40:02] <robertmaxrees> okay, so right now if the user clicks a link after being idle you redirect them?
[20:40:11] <jak2000> yess
[20:40:33] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what have you tried for the client-side?
[20:40:39] <jak2000> nothing
[20:40:41] <robertmaxrees> have you searched on google or anything like that?
[20:40:55] * Woet grabs the popcorn
[20:41:35] <jak2000> robertmaxrees escuse me wich words google, i try and return...
[20:41:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:41:55] <jak2000> any link for read?
[20:42:08] <robertmaxrees> that's not how this works heh.
[20:42:12] <robertmaxrees> do me a favor.
[20:42:22] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#etiquette - read this.  that's the first bullet point?
[20:42:33] <jak2000> ok
[20:42:48] <jak2000> in server side: if (request.getRequestedSessionId() != null && !request.isRequestedSessionIdValid()) {      <---- timedout.. and redirect to login.jsp
[20:42:52] <robertmaxrees> dude
[20:42:59] <Woet> jak2000: you know I told him that literally a dozen times right?
[20:43:05] <Woet> whoops
[20:43:06] <Woet> robertmaxrees: ^
[20:43:13] <robertmaxrees> answer my question - what's the first bullet point on the page i just linked?
[20:43:29] <robertmaxrees> Woet okay?
[20:43:30] <jak2000> :) Google first
[20:43:40] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 exactly :) so go research.
[20:43:43] <jak2000> Woet yes, but a this point not luck.
[20:43:47] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[20:43:49] <robertmaxrees> try to find a solution, and then show us what you've tried.
[20:44:02] <Woet> jak2000: "not luck" because you never put any effort in before asking.
[20:44:04] * jak2000 googling: jquery detect ilde interact
[20:44:04] <robertmaxrees> instead of starting here, learn to fish.  when you get stuck on a solution, show us.
[20:44:23] <jak2000> Woet yes i do effort. if you see i solved the backend :)
[20:44:36] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 neither here nor there :)
[20:44:47] <robertmaxrees> go research and come back with an attempt at a solution.
[20:44:52] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[20:46:14] <jak2000> and i not want aa TOTAL work, only ideas and advice, reading: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/667555/how-to-detect-idle-time-in-javascript-elegantly
[20:46:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:46:34] <robertmaxrees> this is the wrong place to go to for that.
[20:46:43] <robertmaxrees> we need to see what you've tried for a solution.
[20:47:04] <jak2000> my dude, is if i have 100 webpages ( by sample) in each webpage need a jquery code...?
[20:47:10] <jak2000> robertmaxrees ok, making a fiddle
[20:47:23] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 uh
[20:47:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not, like, manually building these pages one-by-one, right?
[20:47:47] <robertmaxrees> you have some kind of templating engine, yeah?
[20:48:37] <jak2000> yes and my own js functions and/or css in files...
[20:48:53] <robertmaxrees> all your js should be in js files.
[20:49:01] <jak2000> yes
[20:49:06] <robertmaxrees> and then you include those using script src=
[20:49:15] <jak2000> yes
[20:49:16] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[20:49:35] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you're asking if "each webpage need a jquery code"
[20:49:51] <jak2000> i have 1 js file for 1 jsp(html) file
[20:50:00] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[20:50:18] <robertmaxrees> not sure what any of this has to do with your question.
[20:54:13] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/0q1z5x9e/6/   <--- trying
[20:54:33] <robertmaxrees> okay?  so what's your question?
[20:54:53] <jak2000> by moment not working, not detecting the idle....
[20:55:19] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[20:55:53] <robertmaxrees> try knocking the time down from 60 seconds to somelike like 5 seconds.
[20:57:05] <robertmaxrees> see how it works?
[20:58:02] <jak2000> ok
[20:58:07] <jak2000> yes changed: 60000 to 5000
[20:58:45] <robertmaxrees> cool
[21:01:23] <doggo> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54392070/how-can-i-feature-geojson-information-in-a-popup-in-leaflet
[21:01:26] <doggo> can anyone help? ^
[21:02:15] <robertmaxrees> doggo is your issue with jQuery?
[21:02:26] <doggo> robertmaxrees: leaflet :x
[21:02:46] <doggo> #leaflet has 22 people in it, was hoping for some crossover in other channels
[21:02:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:03:13] <robertmaxrees> if you haven't gotten help already, going to guess that crossover isn't a thing ;)
[21:03:20] <doggo> :<
[21:04:25] <robertmaxrees> part of your problem is you're tossing out an entire page and then saying "can anybody figure this out?"
[21:04:39] <robertmaxrees> you really want to make an isolated test case first, which often helps you solve the problem yourself.
[21:04:57] <jak2000> Woet see my effort?    basically sometimes i dont know wich magic words put in google....
[21:05:11] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 please don't ping people like that.
[21:05:17] <robertmaxrees> either leave it be or take it to PM.
[21:05:18] <robertmaxrees> thanks.
[21:05:40] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[21:07:39] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/0q1z5x9e/8/    <---- i think: only mousemove and keypress was detected.... but is possible detect all elements of the DOM?  include, scroll bars of the chrome?
[21:08:04] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so how do you think you'd search for that information in google?
[21:08:27] <robertmaxrees> use the clues in the fiddle already to construct your question.
[21:23:21] <robertmaxrees> welp
[21:33:13] <jak2000> :)
[21:33:21] <robertmaxrees> figure it out?
[21:33:51] <jak2000> see something: $('*').bind('mousemove click mouseup mousedown keydown keypress keyup submit change mouseenter scroll resize dblclick', function () {
[21:33:59] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[21:34:00] <robertmaxrees> no no no
[21:34:21] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what $('*') does?
[21:34:32] <jak2000> yes, ALL
[21:34:36] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[21:34:38] <robertmaxrees> you don't want that.
[21:34:48] <jak2000> not... only reading...
[21:34:55] <robertmaxrees> notice how your earlier fiddle just used $(this).mousemove(function (e) {?
[21:35:29] <robertmaxrees> and also: you're being super redundant with your bindong.
[21:35:44] <robertmaxrees>  click mouseup mousedown - just use click, literally no reason you'd use all three there.
[21:35:49] <jak2000> $(this).mousemove(function (e) {   $(this).mouseup(function (e) { $(this).scroll(function (e) {   and so on, right? tsting
[21:35:58] <robertmaxrees> same with keydown, keypress, and keyup
[21:35:59] <robertmaxrees> no.
[21:36:26] <robertmaxrees> $(this).on('click keypress mousemove scroll', function() {});
[21:36:28] <robertmaxrees> at MOST
[21:36:40] <jak2000> oo
[21:37:06] <jak2000> i see other event.. interesting "resize"
[21:37:12] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[21:37:15] <robertmaxrees> dude
[21:37:21] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to worry about it.
[21:37:34] <robertmaxrees> you're WAY overdoing it.  start simpler./
[21:37:46] <jak2000> ok, thanks, catch...
[21:38:07] <robertmaxrees> even just 'mousemove keypress' is really all you need
[21:38:26] <robertmaxrees> since your users will likely move their mouse before clicking on something.
[21:38:43] <jak2000> but the click, detected on scroll bars?
[21:38:55] <robertmaxrees> you have to move your mouse to the scrollbars.
[21:39:31] <jak2000> ok, understand
[22:33:34] <jak2000> off topic, anyone know a channel for ask about RFID?
[22:47:44] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=rfid+freenode (shrug)
[22:54:24] <Woet> jak2000: ##hamradio
[22:54:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:54:31] <robertmaxrees> nooooo
[22:56:53] <jak2000> :)
