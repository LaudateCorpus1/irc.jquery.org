[05:37:54] <TheDude> hi to all
[05:38:16] <TheDude> I have this code. It is a label with an icon inside. When I set all to visible (display:inline)  I don't see all on same line, but the icon  (<i ... > </i>)  go on the next line
[05:38:26] <TheDude> http://pastebin.com/cN2gXqJv
[05:38:52] <TheDude> I use Jquery UI to show and Hide the  icon (and the others such as Label)
[05:39:04] <TheDude> for example: $('#saved-icon').hide("fade", 400, function(){$('#new-icon').show("fade", 400); });
[05:39:30] <TheDude> Someone see if there is something worng?
[05:40:09] <Cork> TheDude: the icon is most likely display: block
[05:40:15] <Cork> change it to display: inline-block;
[05:41:56] <TheDude> mmh I thought doing .show returns the display to the default value (inline)
[05:42:11] <TheDude> this happen only with chrome
[05:42:19] <Cork> what .show does depends on the version of jquery
[05:42:30] <TheDude> with other browser is ok
[05:42:43] <Cork> also it might be a rendering bug in chrome
[05:42:57] <TheDude> XD
[05:42:59] <Cork> it is a bit wanky changing display veruse from time to time
[05:43:10] <Cork> (it has bitten me several times)
[05:54:21] <TheDude> Cork: It work now. I tried to force the "inline-block" display by code ^^
[05:54:26] <TheDude> thanx!
[05:54:57] <Cork> TheDude: i would prob recommend not using show/hide, and instead toggle a class
[05:55:11] <Cork> then you will get a clearer state of how things change
[05:55:27] <Cork> (and cascading and so on.. :D)
[05:55:55] <TheDude> mmh ok, I will provide to change my code ^^
[06:06:30] <d2k> Dear Jquery Gods and Titans: I would like to escape the following inline javascript code inside a append output: $("#flyout-ingresar").append('<li class="burger-close"><a href="window.history.go(0); return false;">Close Menu</a></li>');	 ...I know it's far from good but it woul do the job! Thanks in advance!
[06:11:01] <Cork> d2k: i would recommend parsing the string and then binding the event handler instead
[06:11:13] <Cork> it becomes much cleaner (and less injection prone)
[06:15:32] <d2k> I see, I've been thinking about doing that but I'm not sure how. I'm gonna search for a example and test if it works. Thanks for mentioning the exakt procedure!
[06:20:21] <Cork> d2k: $($.parseHTML('<li class="burger-close"><button type="button">Close Menu</button></li>')).on('click', 'button', function() { window.history.go(0); }).appendTo('#flyout-ingresar')
[06:20:34] <Cork> and then you style the button to look like the link you want
[06:22:23] <d2k> Cork: Thank you so much! It works like a charm :D
[06:22:35] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/31us3kb5/
[06:24:19] <d2k> I'm really thinking of going big and creating a website called "Don@Thor" to pay your beer!! Have a wonderfull day!!
[06:29:31] <d2k> Cork: I would never ever been able to construct that line of code - awesome!
[09:06:08] <Simbaclaws> hey everyone, how would I create a correct deferred for functions so that I can call $.when to check when the functions have finished? I basically have 3 $.getJSON calls with .done and .fail methods, inside those methods are callbacks to functions that process the data and change it into html. I need to call a different function when those callbacks are done and I have quite a lot of trouble getting it to work with deferreds
[09:06:36] <Simbaclaws> I´m not quite sure how this works
[09:06:43] <Simbaclaws> hmmm wait let me make a example
[09:06:46] <Cork> Simbaclaws: just return the value you get from $.getJSON
[09:06:52] <Cork> and feed that into $.when
[09:06:56] <Cork> you don't need to do anything else
[09:07:17] <Simbaclaws> really? Would this also take into account the callbacks within the .done method of that .getJSON call?
[09:07:22] <Cork> $.when($.getJSON(), $.getJSON(), $.getJSON(), $.getJSON()).done(function() {})
[09:07:33] <Cork> Simbaclaws: no
[09:08:14] <Cork> then you prob want to use a $.deferred so you can call back when the deepest one is done
[09:08:38] <Simbaclaws> because it goes like this: var something = $.getJSON(´http://someurl´); something.done(function(data) { processData(data); });
[09:08:50] <Cork> though ajax in ajax is making things really slow so you might want to try to avoid that
[09:08:55] <Simbaclaws> I have 3 of those and need to check when all the dataprocessing is done
[09:09:18] <Cork> is processData async?
[09:09:28] <Simbaclaws> I don´t think so no, how would I check?
[09:09:34] <Simbaclaws> at least it doesn´t use ajax
[09:09:41] <Cork> then you don't need to care
[09:09:42] <Simbaclaws> it basically converts the json string into html
[09:09:50] <Cork> $.when($.getJSON(), $.getJSON(), $.getJSON(), $.getJSON()).done(function() {}) will work
[09:10:12] <Simbaclaws> could I just use the variables linked to those $.getJSON calls?
[09:10:15] <Cork> Simbaclaws: you might want to use .then if you want the following deferres to use the result
[09:10:19] <Cork> no
[09:10:34] <Simbaclaws> so I can´t use something variable?
[09:10:57] <Cork> what you can do is $.when($.getJSON().then(function(data) { return buildHTML(data.list); })).done
[09:11:18] <Cork> and the later .done will the get result from "buildHTML" as "data"
[09:11:45] <Simbaclaws> I´m a bit confused
[09:11:50] <Simbaclaws> sorry
[09:12:55] <Simbaclaws> but then buildHTML has to return a deferred no?
[09:13:47] <shoky_> doesn't have to, it can
[09:13:56] <shoky_> .then is nice like that
[09:14:27] <Simbaclaws> I´ll give this a try but first I´m going to build a jsfiddle to see if it works in there
[09:14:43] <shoky_> that's always a good idea
[09:27:23] <Simbaclaws> hmm I can´t seem to test it in jsfiddle because I´m not serving the json from a https site, I´m using http
[09:28:20] <Cork> Simbaclaws: you can use /echo/json
[09:29:36] <Simbaclaws> does that contain an example json file or do I have to upload mine?
[09:29:50] <Cork> neither
[09:31:38] <Simbaclaws> can I use this with fail methods on the JSON calls?
[09:31:39] <Simbaclaws> $.when($.getJSON('/echo/json').then(function(data) { return buildHTML1(data);}), $.getJSON('/echo/json').then(function(data) { return buildHTML2(data);}), $.getJSON('/echo/json').then(function(data) { return buildHTML3(data);})).done(function(){
[09:31:39] <Simbaclaws> alert("done");
[09:31:39] <Simbaclaws> });
[09:31:44] <Simbaclaws> sorry for the copy paste
[09:32:08] <Cork> Simbaclaws: https://jsfiddle.net/tuurdjxe/
[09:32:13] <Cork> this should give you a starting point
[09:32:19] <Simbaclaws> thanks
[09:33:27] <Simbaclaws> I suppose in the .then I need to call the buildHTML call
[09:33:56] <Simbaclaws> my mind is so chaotic right now
[09:33:59] <Cork> if you don't want to have it as an anonymous ya
[09:34:25] <Cork> what matters is that the argument is the json and the return value is what .done gets
[09:34:46] <Cork> well, rather the arguments is the object/array from the parsed json
[09:38:19] <Simbaclaws> do you know how I can chain this to several ajax calls?
[09:38:29] <Simbaclaws> https://jsfiddle.net/tuurdjxe/1/
[09:38:32] <Simbaclaws> got this right now
[09:38:53] <Cork> chain several calls??
[09:38:58] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[09:39:08] <Simbaclaws> I´m sorry I´m rather confused myself
[09:39:14] <Simbaclaws> hold on let me give an example
[09:40:25] <Cork> also the $('#build').html call doesn't really make sense if you want to use then
[09:41:26] <Cork> Simbaclaws: this might give you a better idea https://jsfiddle.net/tuurdjxe/2/
[09:44:35] <lulul> guys any advice on how to do this code better ? http://notey.it/n/d214
[09:45:42] <Cork> lulul: well data-id you can generalize and set statically for all of them
[09:45:52] <Cork> actually true for both
[09:47:16] <sayhi> hi
[09:50:34] <sayhi> im using fullcalendar - https://fullcalendar.io/docs/ - im a bit stuck on this.. https://fullcalendar.io/docs/mouse/eventClick/ - returns a 'view' object.. now i'd like to use that object to return to that view if the user goed back to my calendar view.. any ideas how?
[09:56:39] <Cork> yay system hang the joy of life...
[09:57:12] <sayhi> console.log( view ) in this case reports a "m…s.constructor {calendar: Calendar_constructor ..... } object seems to be the full calendar
[09:59:31] <Cork> lulul: https://jsfiddle.net/z2q20nct/ this is my recommendation
[09:59:39] <Cork> notice the comment in the html section
[09:59:44] <Cork> opps
[09:59:54] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/z2q20nct/1/ <-- cleaned up
[10:01:45] <Simbaclaws> sorry I had a coffee break at work
[10:01:50] <Simbaclaws> I´ll be right back
[10:04:00] <lulul> Cork didn't think of it that way =D since i'm setting the same value :D
[10:10:06] <lulul> Cork and it works faster than my way =D i was a bit laggy on changing for one row of buttons with those values =D
[10:10:55] <Simbaclaws> @Cork I need to call a function when it´s done building the html
[10:10:59] <Cork> lulul: btw, why don't you just look at the tr from those elements instead?
[10:11:06] <Cork> and remove all the duplicate data?
[10:11:11] <Simbaclaws> not when the ajax call is done
[10:11:18] <Cork> Simbaclaws: that would be the done callback
[10:11:24] <Cork> check the /2/ example
[10:11:41] <Simbaclaws> ah so I can simply run another line and call that function
[10:11:45] <Simbaclaws> I see
[10:11:57] <Cork> Simbaclaws: no, not really
[10:12:07] <Cork> i moved the appending of the result into the done callback
[10:12:18] <Simbaclaws> yes and I can call a function after that right?
[10:12:39] <Cork> you're kinda missing the point
[10:12:58] <Simbaclaws> I´m stupid sorry :(
[10:13:19] <Cork> then is only needed if you want to modify the data returned to the other callbacks
[10:13:33] <Cork> if you don't care about the data you can just use normal .done() callbacks
[10:13:50] <Cork> $.getJSON().done(appendHTML).done(whenDone)
[10:14:05] <Simbaclaws> aaaah
[10:14:15] <Simbaclaws> alright
[10:14:40] <Simbaclaws> so can I use this with 3 json calls simultaniously? When it´s done building all the html for the 3 json calls and put a .done() after that?
[10:14:52] <Cork> and yes $.when($.getJSON().one(append), $.getJSON().one(append)) is posible
[10:15:04] <Cork> yes you can
[10:15:11] <Simbaclaws> ah I think I got it
[10:15:23] <Cork> $.when().done( will get an array with all the data returned from all the ajax calls
[10:16:16] <Simbaclaws> so basically: $.when($.getJSON().done(append), $.getJSON().done(append)).done(doMyCall);
[10:17:22] <Simbaclaws> what´s the best way to write this down? with $.ajax calls? I also need a failsafe for the fail methods on them
[10:17:37] <RenokK> Anybody here that knows a good timepicker? I would use the native <input type="time"> but after testing the support is not quite there yet.
[10:17:45] <Cork> Simbaclaws: or $.when($.getJSON(), $.getJSON()).done(append).done(doMyCall)
[10:18:11] <Cork> if they append to the same element the later one is recommended (you want to avoid adding to the dom multiple times if possible)
[10:18:34] <Simbaclaws> they´re added to different elements
[10:18:58] <Cork> ok, then ya you're on the right track
[10:19:23] <Simbaclaws> alright I´ll make an example, can I use $.ajax calls inside of $.when? This way I can write it down more cleanly
[10:19:43] <Cork> Simbaclaws: $.getJSON is a shorthand for $.ajax
[10:19:56] <Cork> everything doing ajax calls in jquery ends up in $.ajax
[10:20:09] <Simbaclaws> ah yeah I forgot about that
[10:20:14] <Cork> so yes $.when works with $.ajax, (as it works with $.getJSON)
[10:29:18] <Simbaclaws> https://jsfiddle.net/tuurdjxe/3/
[10:29:31] <Simbaclaws> this is what I got right now, it´s not working I probably made a syntax error somewhere
[10:30:52] <Simbaclaws> https://jsfiddle.net/tuurdjxe/4/
[10:31:07] <Simbaclaws> ok so this is what I got now and it´s doing the same as it does in my application, done is displayed first :(
[10:32:04] <Simbaclaws> also number 3 shows undefined
[10:32:35] <ExeciN> Can I have multiple $(document).ready(func1()); blocks? (like one with func1(), another with func2() etc)
[10:32:50] <Cork> Simbaclaws: you're missng the / in the url
[10:32:54] <Cork> its /echo/json/
[10:32:58] <ExeciN> or should I have the callback function call all the other functions?
[10:33:01] <Simbaclaws> ah thanks :)
[10:33:12] <Cork> ExeciN: you can have how many you want
[10:33:15] <Simbaclaws> still though done is displayed in the console first....
[10:33:17] <Simbaclaws> not last
[10:33:18] <Cork> they will be called in binding order
[10:33:33] <ExeciN> Cork: cool, thanks
[10:33:48] <Cork> Simbaclaws: the console log happens in the buildHTML not in the done
[10:34:20] <Simbaclaws> I mean that myFunction displays done when the buildhtml´s are done no?
[10:34:53] <Simbaclaws> however this displays first, not last
[10:36:09] <Simbaclaws> can you see the issue I´m having?
[10:37:36] <Simbaclaws> so when it´s done building the html it should display in the console the word done but it displays first as if the previous calls haven´t finished before it says it´s done
[10:41:48] <FilipNortic__> Simbaclaws: you can use when on multiple defferd object when(d1,d2).then(), that ensures that d1 and d2 is done before
[10:42:12] <Simbaclaws> a so instead of .done I use .then?
[10:42:39] <Simbaclaws> it still displays first though :P
[10:42:56] <Simbaclaws> this is what frustrates me xD
[10:43:44] <FilipNortic__> no... you name all of your ajax request and make do differnt when blocks when(d1).then(d2) when(d1,d2).then(d3)
[10:44:18] <Simbaclaws> alright I´ll try that
[10:44:21] <Simbaclaws> thanks
[10:44:40] <FilipNortic__> don't thank me yet...
[10:45:05] <FilipNortic__> not 100% this works had to go pretty far back in memory
[10:45:14] <Simbaclaws> alright I´m giving it a try
[10:47:19] <Simbaclaws> https://jsfiddle.net/tuurdjxe/5/
[10:47:22] <Simbaclaws> nope, same results
[10:48:56] <Simbaclaws> I can´t wrap my head around this
[10:50:06] <taplar> its odd to me that you're attaching then() and done() to ajax() when your using the ajax as a parameter of when()
[10:50:43] <Simbaclaws> I´m quite new to using deferreds
[10:51:14] <Simbaclaws> how should I do it differently?
[10:51:21] <taplar2> :s
[10:51:24] <taplar2> silly network
[10:51:42] <Simbaclaws> I said I´m quite new to deferreds, how would you suggest I do it differently?
[10:51:57] <taplar2> what is the goal you are trying to achieve?
[10:52:14] <Simbaclaws> I´m trying to call a function after all the html has been build for the 3 ajax calls
[10:52:25] <Simbaclaws> the done console.log
[10:52:30] <Simbaclaws> but it displays first
[10:54:37] <Simbaclaws> I´ve also tried this: https://jsfiddle.net/tuurdjxe/6/
[10:56:16] <taplar2> https://jsfiddle.net/tuurdjxe/7/
[10:57:16] <Simbaclaws> yes! that´s exactly what I need!
[10:57:45] <Simbaclaws> now I´ll have to apply this to some pretty complex code
[10:57:55] <Simbaclaws> let´s see if I can get it to look clean
[11:01:59] <FilipNortic__> Simbaclaws: so you were not intested in making sure which order the buildhtml callbacks were executed?
[11:02:36] <Simbaclaws> I don´t care when the buildhtml callbacks are executed as long as I had my last function called after it
[11:03:14] <FilipNortic__> yeah then you can do it like taplar suggested
[11:06:26] <Simbaclaws> hmmm odd the jsfiddle seems to work but when I apply it to my code it doesn´t >.<
[11:11:19] <FilipNortic__> Simbaclaws: any errors in the log?
[11:11:24] <Simbaclaws> nope
[11:11:45] <Simbaclaws> I have to quit it´s the end of my workday, I´ll work on this tomorrow
[11:12:05] <taplar> man, my network hates irc today
[11:13:12] <taplar> logs aren't showing my last message showed
[11:13:42] <taplar> i tried to say that if you do want to attach some specific then() logic to each of the ajax calls, you can do that, but I think you'll have to create your own $.Deferred that you return to the $.when
[11:21:18] <Tennis> can I close the window automatically if someone goes to another browser tab?
[11:21:58] <taplar> i believe there is a window.close() method, but how do you know they didn't just minimize the window?
[11:22:16] <Tennis> true
[11:22:21] <Tennis> not a perfect goal
[11:22:26] <Tennis> won't be a perfect solution
[11:22:39] <Tennis> looking at onblur at the moment but it didnt work off the bat
[11:23:24] <taplar> are you trying to close like a popup window?
[11:28:00] <Caspan> i have this jsfiddle
[11:28:04] <Caspan> http://jsfiddle.net/s60fws4k/
[11:28:14] <Caspan> wondering how i can unselect a column that is already selected?
[11:28:19] <Caspan> sorry row
[11:28:43] <taplar> removeClass()
[11:28:48] <Caspan> this way i cna select and unselect rows
[11:30:56] <Caspan> toggleClass i am guessing would work?
[11:30:58] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/s60fws4k/1/
[11:31:49] <Caspan> perfect
[11:32:10] <Caspan> question can i query this with JS later to determine what rows are selected based on its class?
[11:32:21] <taplar> sure
[11:32:24] <Caspan> that way all row with a selected class are selected?
[11:32:41] <Caspan> jsut was nost sure when it was applied via JS that the class is actuallt there
[11:32:51] <taplar> as soon as the method executes
[11:32:54] <Caspan> but i guess it actually changed the DOM so i should be able to
[11:32:55] <taplar> it's in the dom
[11:33:07] <Caspan> awesome!!!
[11:33:08] <Caspan> thank you
[11:33:35] <Caspan> would using the toggle also work?
[11:33:37] <taplar> fyi, you could use toggleClass to do this and it would be smaller.  however it's often a good idea to be explicit in your logic
[11:33:45] <Caspan> okay
[11:33:57] <Caspan> makes code eaysier to read also
[11:33:58] <taplar> up to you though
[11:34:19] <Caspan> Jquery gets so nested its hard to read what some commands are doing
[11:36:32] <taplar> oh?
[11:37:31] <Caspan> its jstu that you can have so many commands that run into another i mean
[11:37:44] <Caspan> one liners look beautiful but are hard to read :)
[11:38:11] <taplar> oh sure.  you can chain for miles.  however at some point that is coding practices
[11:38:27] <taplar> any time you lose readability, your should reconsider
[11:38:58] <BobFrankly> are there performance concerns for chaining vs multiple little lines?
[11:39:06] <taplar> not really
[11:39:33] <FilipNortic__> and you can minify your code for production
[11:39:46] <BobFrankly> ^
[11:40:00] <BobFrankly> there's sites that can do that if your code editor doesn't
[11:40:25] <taplar> i have a gulp file that will do it if anyone needs it, :D
[11:40:36] <BobFrankly> notepad.exe is kind of short on features after all
[11:40:38] <BobFrankly> :P
[11:41:07] <FilipNortic__> yeah but it can't minify is way down the list of problems
[11:41:20] <taplar> personally i'd recommend sublime text or vscode over notepad these days
[11:41:38] <BobFrankly> vs code is free
[11:41:53] <taplar> same with sublime if you can stomach the occasional popup
[11:41:56] <FilipNortic__> yeah even vim took a real hit with sublime2
[11:42:08] <BobFrankly> anyone using floobits?
[11:42:30] <IamTrying> https://stripe.com/radar - How to make that 3D object to the left side of "FRAUD PREVENTION DONE RIGHT"
[11:42:34] <FilipNortic__> nope still on vim
[11:45:48] <taplar> i'll hop into vim if i'm in one of my linux vms and i need to edit some tomcat file or something
[11:46:47] <FilipNortic__> hmm there is neovim support on floobits now
[11:56:17] <Tennis> I've got IE closing the tab on lose focus but it does a popup to check if you want to allow IE to close the tab
[11:56:23] <Tennis> doesn't work at all in firefox
[11:57:47] <taplar> sure, cause closing the window that a user is using is kinda trying to take control away from the user
[12:06:19] <Tennis> yeah, ive seen firefox popus do it without asking
[12:06:25] <lulul> given the following code : http://notey.it/n/d25z . if i click once on the button it does the ajax call but in the case of an error 404 from server if i click again ( data params updated by another function) it will still hit me with a 404 error it's like it doesn't check for the vars to see if they have data. also the if var is undefined doesn't seem to return true if it's undefined / empty
[12:06:25] <Tennis> but have been unable to achieve it myself
[12:06:30] <Tennis> and super sadly i have to focus on IE
[12:10:28] <BobFrankly> Tennis: my condolences
[12:11:45] <taplar> lulul: if (surveyId == null) <-- this guy?
[12:12:28] <Tennis> appreeesh
[12:13:47] <lulul> yeah :-D
[12:14:10] <taplar> what about that isn't working?
[12:14:21] <lulul> after i wrote the questions here. i chnged to         if (surveyId == null || surveyId == '') {
[12:14:25] <lulul> seems that it fires
[12:14:51] <taplar> !surveyId
[12:15:06] <taplar> null, undefined, empty string are falsy
[12:15:11] <lulul> aham
[12:15:28] <lulul> and can i do like !surveyId || !officeId || !type ? :D
[12:15:39] <taplar> sure
[12:15:46] <lulul> i see :-D
[12:15:50] <lulul> second problem.
[12:16:19] <lulul> if i fire the ajax once and hits with 404 error .. second time if i click on the button it will return straight 404 .
[12:16:25] <lulul> even if my data attributes are changed before.
[12:16:37] <lulul> i have checked in the html / console to see if they change and they change.
[12:16:45] <lulul> but yet the ajax returns same response
[12:16:52] <lulul> i have set cache: false on it but the same problem.
[12:16:53] <taplar> data() doesn't change the html
[12:17:05] <lulul> taplar i have a select dropdown .
[12:17:15] <lulul> where if i i pick an option it set on my buttons some data attributes
[12:17:16] <taplar> have you console logged the data before you use it to verify that your data is correct?
[12:17:20] <lulul> like survey office and type.
[12:17:26] <taplar> how are you changing them?
[12:17:42] <lulul> http://notey.it/n/d250
[12:17:55] <taplar> don't use attr()
[12:18:03] <taplar> if your going to read with data(), write with data()
[12:18:10] <taplar> don't mix the two
[12:18:24] <lulul> i see
[12:18:31] <taplar> data() caches values so it doesn't have to look them up each time
[12:18:42] <taplar> if you change the attr() after the fact, the cache will not have the latest value
[12:18:53] <lulul> and from there my problem comes no ? :D
[12:18:57] <taplar> yep
[12:19:01] <lulul> because i have already a cache with null / empty
[12:19:04] <lulul> on the vars
[12:19:11] <taplar> data('key', newValue)
[12:19:14] <lulul> and it won't check .. will just fire the ajax or show the error screen
[12:20:24] <lulul> http://notey.it/n/d251 better now :D?
[12:20:41] <taplar> leave off the data- prefix
[12:20:47] <taplar> data() assumes and takes care of that
[12:21:36] <taplar> but sure.  never used the object notation with data() but if it works, cool
[12:24:31] <lulul> taplar weird it doesn't change the data attribute :-?
[12:25:08] <lulul> http://notey.it/n/d252 this is the button :-?
[12:25:28] <taplar> again, you will not see it reflected in the markup or inspector
[12:25:35] <taplar> it's caching it, it's not putting it directly on the element
[12:25:49] <taplar> which is why you have to console log it or look at it in the debugger
[12:26:42] <lulul> erm lol :D
[12:26:45] <lulul> didn't know this one :D
[12:26:55] <lulul>  i was using attr like an idiot =D cuz i wouldn't have seen the change in html .. :D
[12:26:56] <lulul> :))
[12:27:17] <taplar> attr() will show changes in the markup
[12:27:31] <taplar> but your working with data attributes so you really want to use data()
[12:27:47] <taplar> you just have to learn the nuances with it
[12:28:46] <lulul> i'll keep in mind :D
[12:28:49] <lulul> thank you taplar :D
[12:28:53] <taplar> sure
[12:30:12] <sigdk> Hello, I am populating a dropdown menu. What is the proper jquery-way to write it: https://paste.debian.net/891764/  What could I substitute document.createElement("option"); to for example?
[12:30:43] <taplar> $('<option>')
[12:31:29] <taplar> and use map instead of forEach
[12:33:49] <sigdk> taplar, thanks
[12:33:53] <taplar> sigdk: something like https://jsfiddle.net/v30d9yec/
[12:34:16] <sigdk> hmm, much compact
[12:35:03] <sigdk> I have 2 more questions
[12:35:50] <sigdk> how does the async option work?  Shouldn't there be a timeout?
[12:36:11] <sigdk> otherwise I might wait "forever" the dropdown to populate
[12:36:14] <taplar> you don't want to specify async.  you should always be doing async true
[12:36:32] <taplar> and the latest version of jquery removed async
[12:36:38] <taplar> iirc
[12:36:50] <sigdk> taplar, is there some timeout?
[12:36:58] <taplar> whatever your browser or server has
[12:37:10] <sigdk> hmm.... I see
[12:37:39] <taplar> or firewall inbetween you and the server, :)  i've seen those cut off requests before
[12:38:49] <sigdk> Q3) I run the backend locally, nevertheless I get a "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"
[12:38:54] <sigdk> why?
[12:39:11] <taplar> you're running against localhost?
[12:40:06] <shoky> sigdk: the requested resource has different domain/protocol/port than the page
[12:40:18] <taplar> which is where the cors is kicking in
[12:41:13] <taplar> oh, lol, i thought sig said that
[12:41:25] <sigdk> shoky, what do you mean different domain? I 've a tomcat running a servlet under http://localhost:8080/dataman
[12:41:38] <taplar> what resource are you getting the cors on?
[12:41:39] <shoky> sigdk: and what's the full url of the page?
[12:42:12] * taplar punts to shoky and goes to get some lunch, :D
[12:42:18] <sigdk> taplar, I read about cors a while ago, I'm not sure I get the question :)
[12:42:31] <shoky> if it's on the same server you should be able to use   url: '/dataman?...'
[12:42:38] <shoky> without specifying protocol/domain/port
[12:42:59] <sigdk> shoky, what page? the page with the code I showed is stored locally... at my filesyste, I just open it with my browser
[12:43:12] <shoky> yes, and what's the url you open in the browser?
[12:43:27] <BobFrankly> ^
[12:43:58] <shoky> or are you actually loading it from the local filesystem, not via a webserver? cause you shouldn't do that
[12:44:15] <sigdk> I'm doing that... I load it from the filesystem
[12:44:41] <shoky> yeah.. then it's not the same "domain" as the resource you're loading
[12:44:49] <shoky> don't load files from the filesystem
[12:45:52] <shoky> serve them in your tomcat, or open a small webserver for these (e.g. python's `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`  or node's `http-server` module), or any web server
[12:46:33] <shoky> well actually if it's not on the tomcat server (or same localhost:8080 url at least) then you'll still be requesting something from a different origin
[12:46:42] <sigdk> shoky, will it work if I do it within the python server or it has to be in my tomcat?
[12:46:49] <shoky> you can set CORS headers in tomcat for that
[12:47:25] <shoky> sigdk if its not in the tomcat then you'll need tomcat to respond with CORS headers allowing the access from a different origin
[12:47:54] <shoky> http://enable-cors.org/  should have info on how to do that
[12:48:44] <sigdk> shoky, why isn't that enabled by default? Is there any security issue?
[12:48:55] <shoky> yep
[12:49:14] <taplar_lunch> cors is all about security dude
[12:49:50] <BobFrankly> cross-site scripting is the devil. unless you actually meant it to happen.
[12:51:09] <sigdk> hmmm... then how does the app work? The ajax calls are always remote
[12:51:45] <taplar_lunch> what app?
[12:55:57] <sigdk> taplar_lunch, hmm... the ajax call are always remote (from the user side)
[12:56:07] <sigdk> isn't that a different domain?
[12:56:21] <taplar_lunch> 'remote' refers to if the domain it is going to is different from the domain it originated from
[12:57:01] <taplar_lunch> if the user is on http://me.com:80/ and the ajax call goes to http://me.com:80/someendpoint.php, that's same origin
[12:57:18] <robertmaxrees> change any of http, me, com, or 80, and it's different origin.
[13:02:30] <sigdk> hmm... I thought that I can make a call to http://myserver.com/api/geAJSONWithAllUsers  from anywhere... and the only reason this doesn't work is because I don't have a session
[13:02:53] <taplar_lunch> no, traditionally servers have cors enabled
[13:03:03] <taplar_lunch> if your server allows that, then they have change the config to allow it
[13:03:20] <taplar_lunch> either by specifically allowing the different origin, or blanket allowing origins
[13:03:40] <taplar_lunch> it is not uncommon for 'api's to do blanket allows
[13:03:49] <taplar_lunch> since that is kinda their point
[13:07:40] <taplar_lunch> and there isn't a rule that says the cors alter has to be site wide.  apache, at least, has the ability to change cors by directory.  so your /api directory could be open to the world, and everything else is default
[13:10:10] <sigdk> taplar_lunch, I'm still confused. Assume I am a remote client and I open my browser and do a GET http://myserver.com/api/geAJSONWithAllUsers  so, you say that I don't have "cors enabled" the server will not respond?
[13:10:38] <taplar_lunch> you're saying your doing an AJAX request to that url?
[13:10:55] <taplar_lunch> because a browser going to that url is a completely different thing
[13:11:01] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:11:38] <robertmaxrees> let's say you're on foo.com and there's JS on that page that runs an ajax request to bar.com - that's a cors request.
[13:12:07] <robertmaxrees> it's to prevent sites from, say, accessing your gmail account when you visit specially crafted pages.
[13:13:19] <BobFrankly> e-mail link, user clicks on, presents an exact clone of ebay/amazon/bank site
[13:13:25] <sigdk> isn't an ajax request just a GET ?
[13:13:32] <taplar_lunch> no
[13:13:47] <taplar_lunch> it's a special way for javascript to do a web request
[13:14:04] <taplar_lunch> the extra security comes into play because an ajax request can happen without the users knowledge
[13:14:05] <robertmaxrees> it could be a get, post, put, delete... the type doesn't matter.  that you're on one page requesting info from another url is the important part.
[13:14:19] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly that's not what i'm talking about.
[13:14:26] <taplar_lunch> any web requests that happen from the browser itself, not js, is user initiated
[13:14:28] <sigdk> so you tell me that I can fetch the info with GET http://myserver.com/api/geAJSONWithAllUsers    but not by doing an ajax request to http://myserver.com/api/geAJSONWithAllUsers  ?
[13:14:41] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: but it's one of the justifications for the whole CORS situtations
[13:14:44] <taplar_lunch> if you go to that url with the browser, it's not cors
[13:14:44] <robertmaxrees> sigdk not from another domain
[13:14:54] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly not really - you just described a classic phishing attack.
[13:15:18] <taplar_lunch> you the user, going to that url in the browser, made the active choice to do that
[13:15:23] <taplar_lunch> you're aware of it
[13:15:23] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:15:29] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, (!)   but that doesn't make much sense... since I can fetch the users with a simple GET request... why the ajax would be prevented?
[13:15:37] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: yes, but if cors wasn't disabled, it could take your username and password, go to the legit site, and log you in and present all your details
[13:15:38] <taplar_lunch> but ajax, you don't know what it's doing unless your kinda net savy
[13:15:44] <BobFrankly> and you're none the wiser
[13:15:49] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly not at all.
[13:15:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not how CORS works :)
[13:16:04] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly you're thinking of a man in the middle attack.
[13:16:13] <robertmaxrees> sigdk think of it this way,.
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> sigdk imagine you go to my page and browse around, right?
[13:16:34] <sigdk> okay...
[13:16:49] <robertmaxrees> now lets say that you left yourself logged into, say, your email account.
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> you hit my site and it silently, without your knowledge, uses ajax to access your email account and goes to download all of your email.
[13:17:37] <robertmaxrees> because your browser is the one making the request, it sends along all the proper cookies and headers.
[13:17:42] <robertmaxrees> see the problem?
[13:17:48] <sigdk> indeed...
[13:18:01] <taplar_lunch> and it's not even an ajax issue at that point.  the same could be done with an iframe
[13:18:08] <BobFrankly> My understanding of mitm is that it was a networking stack attack
[13:18:09] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ any cross domain request.
[13:18:19] <taplar_lunch> it would still allow unintended access to sites the other site should not have access to
[13:18:42] <taplar_lunch> mitm is more like a proxy attack
[13:18:44] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly mitm is generally anything that sits in between the user and the legitimate resource they're attempting to access.
[13:18:56] <taplar_lunch> if that makes it easier to think of
[13:19:14] <sigdk> is there a way to do a GET request with jquery/javascript ?
[13:19:24] <taplar_lunch> that's what an ajax request is
[13:19:31] <robertmaxrees> sigdk yes.  and ajax CAN do get requests, but you're still limited by CORS.
[13:19:55] <taplar_lunch> if your looking for a javascript work around for CORS, your not going to find one
[13:19:56] <robertmaxrees> so long as the request comes from another page, there's nothing you can do to bypass CORS ruyles.
[13:20:16] <taplar_lunch> anything that javascript can work around, isn't really a security measure, :)
[13:20:24] <robertmaxrees> now, you COULD spin up your own server that acts as a proxy - send requests to it and it fetches and returns the data back to the browser.
[13:20:35] <taplar_lunch> which would be more than just js
[13:20:45] <taplar_lunch> err, front end js
[13:20:57] <taplar_lunch> heh silly node making me be more specific
[13:22:56] <taplar_lunch> but if i remember correctly this case was your localhost was trying to access a file:/// resource in which case you don't need the proxy.  you just need to access those files through localhost
[13:24:06] <sigdk> taplar_lunch, yes
[13:24:24] <robertmaxrees> though a local server, yeah.
[13:26:17] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I don't know the details... but to the example you mentioned... you assumed that js code running on my brower has access to all the cookies... which is not true
[13:26:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:28:10] <taplar_lunch> the browser has access to the cookies.  ajax through it's process has the browser make the request
[13:28:55] <taplar_lunch> you can set that HTTP_ONLY header that makes cookies not available to the page, but they will still be available for future requests
[13:29:21] <robertmaxrees> ^ the browser automatically sends whatever cookies it has for a domain on each request.
[13:29:24] <taplar_lunch> you seem to have a lot of dislike of cors, :)
[13:29:51] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, you said, I hit your site, download some js code, run it, and it sneakily tries to access my mailbox (and send you my mails maybe)...
[13:30:07] <taplar_lunch> lol
[13:30:07] <sigdk> what I say is that this won't work, cause I need a session to do that
[13:30:13] <robertmaxrees> you already have one.
[13:30:16] <taplar_lunch> iframe man, iframe
[13:30:21] <robertmaxrees> if you're logged into your email, you have a session.
[13:30:30] <robertmaxrees> my js doesn't need to know anything about your cookies.
[13:30:41] <robertmaxrees> the browser will send them for me because it's initiating an http request.
[13:32:15] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I thought the browser does some kind of "sandboxing" among different js contexts
[13:32:25] <taplar_lunch> it's not js at that point
[13:32:28] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:32:32] <robertmaxrees> the browser is making an http request.
[13:32:45] <taplar_lunch> js requests the browser to make a request.  at the point the browser makes the request, it's just a request
[13:33:07] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[13:33:13] <taplar_lunch> but your browser knows your js made the request, so it has a referrer
[13:33:26] <robertmaxrees> just like clicking on a link on a site has a referrer.
[13:33:27] <taplar_lunch> which i assume is what the cors uses
[13:36:55] <sigdk> okay, I don't to be annoying (I'll go through our history again, this is interesting) but...  how does the server know which domain sent the request?  What is the difference between an ajax call from code that the server sent to the user, and an ajax call from a malicious "3rd party" program?
[13:37:18] <taplar> the referrer, i'd assume
[13:37:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:37:45] <taplar> and there isn't a difference between a malicious separate origin and a legitimate origin to the sever
[13:37:48] <taplar> server
[13:37:55] <taplar> they are all separate origins
[13:38:01] <taplar> it's up to you to allow the 'safe' ones
[13:40:03] <sigdk> okay... I didn't know about the notion of referrer/iframe
[13:40:06] <taplar> i keep forgetting the red/white hat site that has alot of this stuff
[13:40:11] <sigdk> this is set by the browser, right?
[13:40:16] <taplar> yes
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> sigdk yep.
[13:40:19] <sigdk> that makes sense
[13:40:42] <sigdk> taplar, yes, if you have any resource to share, that would be good
[13:41:02] <sigdk> but thank you both for the enlightenment
[13:41:16] <taplar> i'm blanking and it's annoying me
[13:41:44] <robertmaxrees> owasp?
[13:41:53] <taplar> yes!!! ty
[13:43:22] <taplar> i need to bookmark that
[13:43:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:44:43] <taplar> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)
[13:45:47] <taplar> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)
[13:45:54] <taplar> lots of goodies
[13:45:59] <robertmaxrees> ^ btw, xss and cors are not related.
[13:46:05] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, great reads all around.
[14:07:55] <mrjonleek> Sup y'all... Anyone have experience with devbridge autocomplete (https://www.devbridge.com/sourcery/components/jquery-autocomplete/)? Can't get AJAX source to work correctly...
[14:12:12] <taplar> checkit: you've structured it like they have under "Usage" ?
[14:17:19] <taplar> ooooooone is the loneliest number that can ever beeeee!
[14:33:19] <robertmaxrees> i really hope my insurance won't balk at my epi pen.
[14:33:42] <taplar> :(
[14:40:18] <arc_> what are you allergic to?
[14:40:32] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: but the rich guys at the top of that claim they heavily discount those things
[14:40:42] <arc_> telling people they need to use delegated event listeners?
[14:40:46] <robertmaxrees> arc_ great question!
[14:40:47] <robertmaxrees> we have no idea.
[14:40:52] <arc_> oh, sux
[14:41:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah...  i almost got sent to the ER last night.
[14:41:24] <BobFrankly> no fun there
[14:41:31] <taplar> dude
[14:41:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.  epi shot, benadryl, pepcid, and i can't remember what else.
[14:41:49] <BobFrankly> I've got allergies, but my worst reaction is difficulty breathing
[14:42:29] <taplar> if it's that bad you might consider one of those allergy tests.  sux if you don't like needles, but...
[14:43:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah - talking to my doctor tomorrow about it.  we're already tryinbg to figure it out.  he thought it was one of my medications buuut i want ot get more aggressive.
[14:43:50] <BobFrankly> I did one of those grid tests as a kid, but they can do it off a blood sample now
[14:43:59] <taplar> oooooh, neat
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah but it takes longer.
[14:44:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather know asap tbqh.
[14:44:44] <BobFrankly> found certain trees dont get along with me, but dust isn't one of my allergens
[14:45:11] <robertmaxrees> fun fact: did you know most people who think they're allergic to dust aren't?
[14:45:14] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: on the other hand, the blood test doesn't risk you needing to use another epipen
[14:45:21] <taplar> idk of anything personally, though i've never eaten shell fish to my knowledge so who knows
[14:45:37] <BobFrankly> I honestly didn't know, but my mother thought I'd be allergic to dust
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah- it's not the dust, it's dust mite feces most of the time.
[14:46:01] <robertmaxrees> learned that one a loooong time ago.
[14:46:46] <taplar> is lobster considered shell fish?
[14:47:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:47:20] <taplar> ah, i'm good on that front then
[14:47:35] <robertmaxrees> "shellfish allergy" can be for crabs/lobsters/etc or for clams/mussels/etfc.
[14:47:42] <taplar> i wasn't sure if it was restricted more to molusks
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> you can be allergic to one, the other, or both.
[14:48:48] * taplar is one of those guys who goes to a seafood place with friends and will get a burger
[14:49:10] <arc_> robertmaxrees that's kind of a weird concept. then you get into ... what is dust
[14:49:21] <taplar> skin cells
[14:49:25] <arc_> like is there something that is just dust and not made of something else
[14:49:26] <robertmaxrees> dust mite poop, skin, etc.
[14:49:36] <arc_> right
[14:49:56] <BobFrankly> it's like with cats and dogs, you're not allergic to thier hair, it's thier saliva on the hair
[14:49:59] <robertmaxrees> dander, sand, flour, etc.
[14:50:07] <taplar> what?
[14:50:11] <robertmaxrees> dirt.
[14:50:15] <taplar> saliva?
[14:50:19] <taplar> :s
[14:50:26] <taplar> so if they lick you your fked?
[14:50:35] <BobFrankly> taplar: depends on the allergy
[14:50:37] <arc_> depends how severe your allergy is
[14:50:41] <taplar> wow
[14:50:46] <robertmaxrees> dander is another common one for pets.
[14:51:40] <robertmaxrees> amnd with that, i'm off to team building.  enjoy :)
[14:52:05] <taplar> make sure to man handle the base!
[14:52:53] <taplar> while playing that all about the base song
[14:53:37] <taplar> idk why they say i'm not suited for management
[14:55:48] <BobFrankly> they don't say I'm not suited for management
[14:55:52] <BobFrankly> I say that
[14:56:04] <taplar> well, you are a frank person
[14:56:04] <BobFrankly> I haven't the stomach for politics
[15:03:07] <taplar> reminds me of the brian regan butterfly farm joke
[15:05:37] <BobFrankly> now there's a comedian
[15:06:01] <BobFrankly> regan and gaffigan are two of my favs
[15:43:46] <frankiee_> Hi! Where do I find freelancers?
[15:44:33] <taplar> i think there is a ##freelance
[15:44:51] <frankiee_> ah with the two ##
[15:44:54] <frankiee_> thanks taplar
[16:12:26] <agrippaz> Halp! Issue: need to be able to reset the form so all the radio buttons and checkbox inputs are re-set to their original state and appearance.  http://jsbin.com/feyiyekovi/
[16:12:38] <agrippaz> I tried reloading that part of the page via $('#form-body').empty(); and $('#form-body').load('index.php #form-body'); but it did not work
[16:12:54] <taplar> $(formSelector).get(0).reset()
[16:13:16] <agrippaz> i tried $().button('reset');, but will try that taplar
[16:14:29] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset
[16:14:37] <agrippaz> doesn't work. :(
[16:14:49] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[16:15:02] <agrippaz> sent   http://jsbin.com/feyiyekovi/
[16:15:06] <agrippaz> is that ok?
[16:15:49] <taplar> something smaller would be preferred
[16:17:19] <agrippaz> ah yeah sorry
[16:17:29] <agrippaz> that's the form though, do you see the blue buttons
[16:17:36] <agrippaz> i need to reset all those
[16:18:24] <agrippaz> I tried reloading that part of the page via $('#form-body').empty(); and $('#form-body').load('index.php #form-body'); but it did not work
[16:18:35] <agrippaz> also $('button.active').removeClass('active'); did not work
[16:19:30] <taplar> your jsbin has a syntax error showing up in the console
[16:20:22] <agrippaz> none of the console errors are from the code I provided, it looks like they are coming from jsbin because it's a piece of crap
[16:20:38] <taplar> any syntax error can cause the whole script to stop working
[16:20:39] <agrippaz> when i run it on its own, there are no console errors
[16:20:51] <agrippaz> well then it's jsbin's fault and i can't fix it =(
[16:21:06] <agrippaz> it's live here: oridou.com/buddy3/
[16:21:13] <agrippaz> on the exact code in the JSbin
[16:27:44] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/sLzvaLug/1/
[16:31:05] <taplar> reset() resets the form elements to their original value.  it doesn't change anything else you have done to them like adding/removing classes or anything like that
[16:32:38] <agrippaz> right
[16:32:58] <agrippaz> hmm
[16:33:04] <agrippaz> thanks for the fiddle, i'm studying it
[16:33:31] <taplar> if you consider going that route i'd recommend making some classes instead of doing the attribute thing
[16:33:48] <agrippaz> i even tried putting that reset button on the page and using it, but pressing it does not reset the form whatsoever and in fact you can just press submit again after pressing reset and it submits the form with the previous configuration of inputs
[16:35:04] <agrippaz> taplar, can you explain what the [0] does in document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].reset();? I hadn't seen that and am not sure what it's doing there
[16:35:24] <taplar> getElementsByTagName can return multiple elements so it always returns an array
[16:35:53] <taplar> so it's just getting the first one, in this case the only one, to do the reset on
[16:35:59] <agrippaz> hmm so is [0] <body> or something?
[16:36:12] <agrippaz> or <form>
[16:36:37] <taplar> ya, the first element of the results, which is the form in this case
[16:36:41] <agrippaz> gotcha
[16:37:09] <taplar> i'm updating it though since your showing interest, :D
[16:37:37] <agrippaz> thx i need to solve this =
[16:37:40] <agrippaz> =)
[16:39:12] <agrippaz> it's just plain not resetting the form my friend, i don't know what to say. document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].reset();
[16:39:38] <agrippaz> try it out oridou.com/buddy3/
[16:39:47] <agrippaz> ln 127 in walkbud.js i put your fix
[16:39:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/sLzvaLug/2/
[16:40:20] <agrippaz> that demo works great
[16:40:23] <agrippaz> exactly what i need
[16:41:06] <agrippaz> just need to be able trigger the reset programmaticly, and for it to work
[16:41:23] <taplar> one sec
[16:42:36] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/sLzvaLug/3/
[16:43:03] <agrippaz> hmm
[16:43:07] <taplar> so long as you can find the form, you can reset it
[16:43:29] <agrippaz> the form has an id called theForm so i've been selecting it by '#theForm' and it hasn't done anything
[16:43:44] <taplar> $('#theForm').get(0).reset()
[16:43:50] <agrippaz> yep, ran that 10 times
[16:44:01] <taplar> then you got something else going on
[16:44:24] <agrippaz> did you mean get[0] ?
[16:44:30] <taplar> no, it's a method
[16:44:39] <agrippaz> gotcha
[16:45:12] <agrippaz> implemented it
[16:45:46] <agrippaz> in the posting.done ajax callback, all the other addClass and removeClass run just fine in that code block, so I know it's getting to it and executing the command you sent
[16:47:46] <agrippaz> if $('#theForm').get(0).reset() worked, wouldn't I be able to type it into the console after the page has loaded and I click some form elements?
[16:48:30] <taplar> you should be able to change some of the values of the form elements, run that, and watch them change back
[16:48:34] <agrippaz> but it does not. it reports "undefined"
[16:48:55] <taplar> reset() may not return anything
[16:49:06] <agrippaz> well, it also did nothing at all.
[16:49:18] <agrippaz> <form id="theForm">
[16:49:28] <agrippaz> <form id="theForm" name="theForm">
[16:49:31] <agrippaz> no dice
[16:49:54] <taplar> then you have something else going on like i said.  as you saw from the fiddle, reset does indeed reset form elements
[16:50:16] <agrippaz> yeah that's why i'm here and not fixing it myself after googling for a week
[16:50:51] <relipse> what is wrong with my syntax $("div:contains('1) Did you personally')") I keep getting a Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: personally')(…)
[16:51:05] <relipse> its not the extra ')' is it?
[16:52:12] <agrippaz> you are really looking for "1) Did you personally" ?
[16:53:14] <relipse> ok it appears that having the ")" in there causes it to error
[16:53:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5eqesa4r/
[16:53:36] <agrippaz> maybe you want  $("div:contains'(1) Did you personally')")
[16:53:40] <taplar> works fine
[16:55:50] <agrippaz> maybe you want  $("div:contains('1\)Did you personally')") maybe?
[16:56:02] <relipse> maybe its my jquery version then
[16:56:09] <agrippaz> relipse, what is the exact string you want to match
[16:56:14] <taplar> personally i would recommend changing it to a filter instead
[16:56:23] <relipse> taplar how do i use filter
[16:56:55] <taplar> $('div').filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.indexOf('1) Did you personally') > -1; })
[17:02:22] <taplar> the reason i would recommend that is :contains is a pseudo selector which will make it go through sizzle and can be slow.  using filter is typically more performant
[17:02:38] <relipse> ok thanks
[17:04:50] <degva> hello, I'm trying to do a get request using $.ajax() but the browser is doing an OPTIONS request. I get an error saying Cross-origin Request Blocked. Why is this happening?
[17:05:49] <taplar> are you trying to go to a domain other than the page you are on?
[17:06:33] <taplar> because that is what that error indicates
[17:06:40] <degva> taplar, yes. The URL I'm trying to get data from is on a local machine. There I have a virtual machine which does the get request.
[17:07:15] <taplar> CORS security measures prevent ajax requests from one domain to another without the destination server allowing it
[17:08:01] <taplar> http://enable-cors.org/
[17:08:06] <degva> Is there a way I can disable it? or in any case, how can I make the destination server allow it?
[17:08:11] <taplar> ^
[17:09:22] <degva> taplar thanks!
[17:20:06] <xcel-> can anyone help me with what i (think) should be an easy task
[17:20:24] <xcel-> i have a script that works fine on codepen, but it doesnt work locally
[17:20:53] <xcel-> i've copied this: http://codepen.io/delanfranchi/pen/NxWzjY and its all fine except the scrolling doesnt work (move sideways) but somehow it runs fine on codepen
[17:21:15] <taplar_afk> any console errors?
[17:21:18] <xcel-> nope
[17:21:43] <taplar_afk> all your network requests are coming back 200 or 304?
[17:21:52] <xcel-> taplar_afk: just wont scroll sideways, it should be added im very noob at javascript/jquery
[17:22:28] <xcel-> taplar_afk: yes
[17:23:01] <taplar_afk> if (! isScrolling) <-- that looks weird
[17:23:58] <xcel-> whats should i replace it with? how come it can run on codepen? :S
[17:24:13] <taplar_afk> wouldn't think there should be a space
[17:24:26] <taplar_afk> so your saying the scroll logic works on codepen?
[17:24:33] <xcel-> yes
[17:24:54] <taplar_afk> i'm not seeing anything happen.  what should be happening?
[17:25:07] <xcel-> video should move sideways while scrolling down
[17:25:26] <taplar> i don't see that at all
[17:25:45] <xcel-> which browser?
[17:25:54] <taplar> ff
[17:26:43] <xcel-> works on ff for me try with a smaller window
[17:27:00] <taplar> your going to want to throttle that scroll handler though
[17:28:31] <xcel-> does it work taplar ?
[17:28:39] <taplar> nope
[17:28:45] <xcel-> huh
[17:28:47] <taplar> it's always setting the transform to 0
[17:31:00] <taplar> there we go
[17:31:29] <taplar> i had to change two things
[17:31:33] <taplar> positionVideo = $(window).scrollTop() * positionRatio * -1;
[17:31:42] <taplar> 'transform':'translate3d('+positionVideo+'px,0,0)'
[17:33:19] <taplar> so yeah, couple things
[17:33:35] <taplar> you most likely want to throttle this guy so he isn't firing on every scroll
[17:33:49] <taplar> cause a scroll can fire tons of time for a single wheel movement
[17:33:57] <xcel-> ok...
[17:34:02] <taplar> and second, you don't want to be doing lookups in your event handler
[17:34:21] <taplar> so things like $(window) and $('video') should be pulled out into variables and use those variable sinside
[17:34:24] <xcel-> well the second line looks the same as is? im sorry i've just copied the code :) im too noob
[17:34:42] <taplar> i took out the leading '-' before the variable
[17:34:53] <xcel-> oh
[17:35:16] <taplar> dunno why but that part seemed to be fubaring it on my end
[17:35:34] <taplar> which is why i put the * -1 on the equation
[17:36:27] <xcel-> still doesnt work over here :/
[17:36:52] <taplar> dunno then man.  if your not seeing any console errors, and your console errors are enable for javascript, you got something else going on
[17:37:02] <taplar> make sure all your selectors are finding the things they should be
[17:40:17] <xcel-> there something shady with "::before"
[17:41:02] <taplar> do you have something locally that does the scss generation to css?
[17:43:36] <xcel-> hmm
[17:44:38] <xcel-> ah wait
[17:47:59] <xcel-> im thats the issue, i just used sassmesiter.co
[17:48:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2j8r0g5g/
[17:48:13] <xcel-> sassmeister.com
[17:48:47] <taplar> oh, you manually compiled it and used the compilation
[17:49:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2j8r0g5g/1/ had left an extra bind in there
[17:56:43] <xcel-> taplar: yes thanks a million, now how do i convert the scss to css :/
[17:57:43] <taplar> i'm sure there are libraries out there that will do it for you, but really when you get to a productional environment you don't want to be doing that in the browser.  you want it already compiled
[18:03:22] <catbadger> any jqgrid people in here?
[18:03:46] <catbadger> I'm trying to deselect all rows on all jqgrids on a page with many grids.
[18:03:59] <catbadger> for some reason not all functions work on all grids
[18:05:57] <xcel-> taplar: im really thankful for you help, just... what should i do now? :/
[18:06:15] <taplar> dunno man, without seeing it fail it's hard for me to help you debug
[18:06:49] <taplar> best i can do is point you to a resource like http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[18:09:40] <xcel-> taplar: well the jsfiddle works fine but can i just use the .scss instead of a regular css? or do i need to compile it?
[18:10:02] <taplar> afaik you have to compile it.  browsers do not understand scss natively
[18:10:40] <xcel-> i see thanks
[18:10:40] <taplar> scss/less and their ilk are just ways for developers to structure their styling so it's easier to manage
[18:10:56] <taplar> and then it gets compiled to actual css for use
[18:15:17] <taplar> so if you don't have the desire to automate the compilation, sites like that sassmeister are fine for doing the compilation
[18:53:40] <WorldsEndless> My query returns a collection. For each item of the collection, I need to see if a sub-item contains a certain value. What are the jQuery functions I need to execute a query relative to a particular item?
[18:54:03] <taplar> $(parentSelector).find(childSelector)
[18:54:38] <taplar> $(parentSelector).find(childSelector).filter(function(){ return this.value === 'the desired value'; })
[18:55:17] <taplar> provided by 'value' you mean <sometag value=""></sometag>
[18:57:14] <WorldsEndless> oh, value would actually be innerHTML or HTML in this case
[18:57:39] <taplar> and are you wanting to see if any of those are true, or are you wanting to filter the parents to the ones that have that child with the value?
[18:58:18] <WorldsEndless> So the case is a directory. For each listing, if the name on the listing is no match with the search query, it needs to have display=none
[19:00:16] <taplar> is it a structure like a ul with lis that have a file/folder name, and folders having a nested ul structure?
[19:00:59] <taplar> fixing to head out to go home, but if your not doing regex then your filter would be something like
[19:01:28] <WorldsEndless> Each item is an li. The full path to a thing is [li div h4] (and there are many divs to choose from for each item)
[19:01:31] <taplar> filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.indexOf( stringToMatch ) > -1; })
[19:02:17] <taplar> if your doing regex instead of indexOf it would be whatever that method is.  test() or match().  i forget which
[19:03:14] <WorldsEndless> this would be the entire li object, where the target for filtering is a [div h4] within it
[19:03:24] <taplar> to simplify your logic, btw, i'd start the whole thing by either showing or hiding all of them.  that way your logic doesn't have to do IF (true) show ELSE hide
[19:03:54] <WorldsEndless> This will be an incremental search on an already loaded directory, triggered by an on-change event
[19:04:20] <taplar> cool, just things to keep in mind, :)
[19:04:26] <WorldsEndless> Yeah, I appreciate it
[19:05:03] <taplar> i'm outie.  Hasta Mañana
[20:39:56] <converge> is there a way to make this line $(".player_input").css("display", "table-cell"); behavior like toggle() (show/hide)?
[21:20:47] <converge> is there a way to get the checkbox ID when I click it ?
[21:22:36] <converge> just did it
[21:36:17] <converge> anyone knows why this jquery doesnt disable my input box ? https://gist.github.com/converge/2afd5a2d685f23f5b2c5fec72f45310b
[23:27:06] <coldhead> bye snover
