[18:20:37] <cloud69> Howdy! Is there a way to listen for Chrome autocomplete events? I'm trying to add an extra class to my inputs after they've been filled by autocomplete
[18:21:28] <robertmaxrees> cloud69 what's the class for?
[18:21:44] <robertmaxrees> just styling?
[18:22:15] <cloud69> nevermind I figured out the right keywords to put into google and found a nice stackoverflow page :D
[18:22:27] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: yes and no, im working on this floating labels setup:
[18:22:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not as straightforward as you're think.

[18:22:42] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can kind of do it via css but it's a pain.
[18:22:50] <cloud69> yup :/
[18:22:59] <cloud69> i chose to split it up into css and jquery so it would make more sense
[18:23:13] <robertmaxrees> avoid using jquery at all when dealing with styling.
[18:23:25] <cloud69> it still feels a bit clunky the way i've done it though :/
[18:23:30] <cloud69> hehe :D
[18:23:34] <robertmaxrees> see my last comment ;)
[21:29:20] <errorous> hello. I have an array of nodes. Then I convert it to jquery object. Then I do find() on that object, and it doesn't work. Should I actually use inArray?
[21:29:47] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting .find() to get in that case?]
[21:30:01] <errorous> robertmaxrees elements by selector
[21:30:33] <robertmaxrees> let me clarify: .find() searches for descendents of elements in the jquery object.
[21:31:07] <errorous> robertmaxrees I've this: https://pasteboard.co/JJnQQZZ.png
[21:31:16] <robertmaxrees> screenshot :(
[21:31:20] <errorous> I wanna extract only div.single-project objects
[21:31:32] <robertmaxrees> then you want .filter()
[21:31:39] <robertmaxrees> .filter('.single-project')
[21:32:09] <errorous> thanks!
[21:33:35] <robertmaxrees> i might rethink what you're doing btw.
[21:33:47] <robertmaxrees> mixing textNodes and elements in a jquery object like that is kinda weird.
[21:39:44] <errorous> robertmaxrees I'm getting html from a template
[21:39:53] <errorous> so I have spaces and linebreaks
[21:39:54] <errorous> and such
[21:39:57] <errorous> not intentional
[21:40:08] <robertmaxrees> still, putting textNodes into jquery like that's gonna give you headaches.
[21:40:33] <errorous> it's a real simple function, don't really care much
[21:40:38] <robertmaxrees> heh okie.
[21:40:51] <errorous> and that's the only processing I do on that html, so, yeah, couldn't care less :)
[21:41:09] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: okie.  already had an issue but hopefully that's the only one :)
[21:41:31] <errorous> I had an issue because I didn't know find() should be filter() :)
[22:44:13] <errorous> love me some redeyes( not in plane ) that bring nice chunk of money :)
[22:47:55] <robertmaxrees> tbh thankful i've never done that haha
