[00:05:15] <Demonicpagan> what would cause http://jsfiddle.net/gy0bnctL to error when form submitted with form errors in IE 11? error messages display if tested in chrome or firefox
[00:05:41] <Woet> Demonicpagan: what is the error?
[00:08:37] <Demonicpagan> i can't pinpoint it because it is throwing an error written into my coldfusion page
[00:08:59] <Demonicpagan> it is only in IE 11 in which i get it
[00:09:16] <mintux> This code doesn't work anymore ? $('#area p:odd').addClass('highlight');
[00:12:38] <Woet> mintux: it does.
[00:13:06] <Woet> Demonicpagan: not sure what you mean, why can't you get the actual error?
[00:13:56] <mintux> i don't get error but it doesn't work let me paste it in jsfilde
[00:14:36] <Woet> mintux: okay, why not?
[00:20:10] <mintux> Woet: sorry this is: http://jsfiddle.net/9v01ehwh/
[00:21:02] <Woet> mintux: your selector is div:odd, there are no divs other than #group
[00:21:28] <mintux> Ow
[00:21:46] <mintux> i've forgotten to change it because it was div first
[02:59:21] <cuppy> Is anyone else having issues with jsfiddle? When I RUN, I get POST http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/ net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED in console
[03:09:10] <yaro_> Hi guys, I need some help with $.ajax()
[03:09:24] <yaro_> check this plunker please http://plnkr.co/edit/U9qHBjX7bVpHFZhJ0xOD?p=options, script.js file
[03:09:32] <yaro_> I want to send multiple ajax calls for each element
[03:09:55] <yaro_> but I want to send those in order, next ajax should be fired after the first one finishes
[03:10:01] <yaro_> and I dont want to use async flag
[03:10:10] <yaro_> how can I achieve that?
[03:16:21] <yaro_> anyone? :/
[03:21:57] <rpag> yaro_, i cant think of anyway except using async: false.
[03:22:58] <yaro_> but async is deprecated, so I am kinda confused
[03:23:10] <yaro_> the order of the ajax calls is very important
[03:23:15] <yaro_> in my case
[03:23:25] <rpag> i didnt know it was deprecated
[03:26:06] <rpag> maybe this is why: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests
[03:26:22] <rpag> "In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code which creates "freezing" on the screen and an unresponsive user experience."
[03:27:08] <yaro_> that sounds reasonable but then I need different solution for "foreach and sequential ajax" calls
[03:27:57] <rpag> yeah im not sure
[03:35:31] <Left_Turn> hey is Jquery UI equivalent to YUI?
[04:21:13] <frank____> How can I adjust the script so that the background color of the div turns to red while the div is moving? Basic jQuery. http://jsfiddle.net/cderell/drya8b92/17/
[04:44:17] <shredding> i try working with promises - how can i get the response header?
[05:45:36] <Mark____> can anyone help me?
[05:53:42] <Versality> Mark____: spit it out
[05:54:05] <Mark____> versality: okay, i will spit everything out
[05:54:31] <Mark____> i don’t know if this is proper way to address this though lol
[05:54:33] <Mark____> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/board_lPQY33
[05:54:49] <Mark____> if you go to this webpage, there is a small button on the top center
[05:54:56] <Mark____> that looks like ‘로그인’
[05:54:58] <Mark____> can you find it?
[05:55:14] <Mark____> if you click it a layer comes down from the top rightside
[05:55:49] <Versality> Mark____: yup, got it
[05:56:05] <Mark____> and this is the code, it’s a bit lengthy
[05:56:10] <Mark____> jQuery(function($){
[05:56:11] <Mark____> 	// Login
[05:56:13] <Mark____> 	// Div unwrap
[05:56:14] <Mark____> 	var $account = $('.account');
[05:56:16] <Mark____> 	$account.unwrap().unwrap();
[05:56:17] <Mark____> 	// Toggle
[05:56:19] <Mark____> 	var $acTog = $('a[href="#acField"]');
[05:56:20] <Mark____> 	var $acField = $('#acField');
[05:56:22] <Mark____> 	$acTog.click(function(){
[05:56:23] <Mark____> 		$this = $(this);
[05:56:25] <Mark____> 		$acField.slideToggle(200, function(){
[05:56:26] <Mark____> 			var $user_id = $(this).find('input[name="user_id"]:eq(0)');
[05:56:28] <Mark____> 			if($user_id.is(':visible')){
[05:56:29] <Mark____> 				$user_id.focus();
[05:56:31] <Mark____> 			} else {
[05:56:32] <Mark____> 				$this.focus();
[05:56:34] <Mark____> 			}
[05:56:35] <Mark____> 		});
[05:56:37] <Mark____> 		return false;
[05:56:38] <Mark____> 	});
[05:56:40] <Mark____> 	// Close
[05:56:41] <Mark____> 	$acField
[05:56:43] <Mark____> 		.append('<button type="button" class="close">&times;</button>')
[05:56:43] <Versality> Mark____: don't paste any code in here, use services such as pastebin
[05:56:44] <Mark____> 		.find('>.close').click(function(){
[05:56:46] <Mark____> 			$(this).closest($acField).slideUp(200, function(){
[05:56:47] <Mark____> 				$acTog.eq(0).focus();
[05:56:48] <Mark____> 			});
[05:56:49] <Mark____> 			return false;
[05:56:50] <Mark____> 		});
[05:56:51] <rpag> too late for that
[05:56:58] <Versality> Mark____: I can't read that that mess here anyway
[05:57:17] <Mark____> sorry:p
[05:57:21] <Mark____> sec.
[05:57:38] <Mark____> http://jsfiddle.net/becp1ma9/
[05:57:40] <Mark____> this is the code.
[05:57:46] <Mark____> i should have thought of this before pasting lol
[05:58:35] <Mark____> my question is, how do i move the layer to the center of the page when it appears, and also how do i apply fade in effect instead of the slidedown effect?
[06:00:59] <Mark____> i know this is a bit complicated, don’t bother if you have no idea.
[06:03:56] <Versality> Mark____: If I understand your question correctly, replacing animation type is simple as replacing your slideToggle with fadeIn. As for centering can't you do it with just using CSS? http://note.io/1zrRjmo
[06:04:59] <Versality> Mark____: don't see anything complicated here to be honest
[06:05:50] <Mark____> oh well, this is not the work of mine, actually. so I found everything complicated.
[06:06:02] <Mark____> thanks for the centering, i did not see that in css code.
[06:13:18] <Mark____> now i have to get rid of that slidedown...
[06:13:32] <Mark____> replacing slidedown with fadein didn’t work.. lol
[06:20:52] <Versality> Mark____: I think you're doing something terribly wrong http://recordit.co/CXXVsrIyJm
[06:22:01] <Versality> that jQuery snippet you've sent is unreasonably complicated
[06:22:25] <Versality> Almost everything you need can be shrieked to a few lines of code
[06:22:38] <Versality> shrinked*
[06:22:42] <Mark____> i see you have technology.
[06:26:27] <Mark____> how do i use fadeIn and out toggle though?
[06:26:32] <Mark____> is it fadetoggle?
[06:27:03] <Mark____> i feel dumb.
[06:27:04] <Mark____> thanks.
[06:28:18] <Versality> Mark____: yeah, http://api.jquery.com/fadetoggle/
[06:30:18] <Mark____> um, one last question : how do i make everything dimmed but the login layer?
[06:31:19] <Mark____> any idea?
[06:33:09] <Versality> Mark____: on particular action (whether that's a click in your case or something else). You show fixed element with height and width of 100% of the screen, with dark color of your choice (black for example) and set opacity to something .7
[06:33:17] <Versality> then on top you display your login layer
[06:33:24] <Versality> that will make background look dimmed
[06:35:06] <Mark____> that sounds extremely complicated for me. but i see your point. thanks.
[06:35:26] <Mark____> im gonna have to actually study jquery after im done with css/html
[06:37:53] <Versality> Mark____: yeah, knowing CSS and HTML will help you a lot. But before diving into jQuery, I'd strongly recommend learning JS first.
[06:38:04] <Versality> it will pay off a lot in future
[07:07:55] <earational> hey
[07:14:27] <Mark____> hello
[07:14:29] <Mark____> anyone alive?
[07:15:44] <Mark____> does anybody know how to load a #layer with onclick function?
[07:31:36] <Paradisee> hello o/
[07:31:42] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/0X4SVNB <-- Read the comment
[07:32:42] <Paradisee> or is there a directly way to know if there's one?
[07:34:44] <Mark____> anybody know how to change display:none to display: block?
[07:34:59] <Mark____> *with on click
[07:35:43] <Paradisee> your_object.css({display: block});
[07:36:23] <Mark____> that’s not the answer im looking for but thanks.
[07:55:43] <Versality> Mark____: http://api.jquery.com/click/
[08:04:02] <Mark____> um, it doesn’t work for some reason.
[08:07:36] <Mark____> http://jsfiddle.net/wmye3nk3/
[08:08:36] <decx> class=".loginbutton" nice
[08:10:06] <Mark____> oh
[08:10:31] <Mark____> thanks.now it works
[08:10:37] <Mark____> but i don’t know how to make it toggle
[08:11:23] <Mark____> toggleClass('show’);?
[08:11:58] <Mark____> nope.
[08:27:16] <Paradisee> is there a way to check if an item is inside an array?
[08:32:26] <Paradisee> something like this: http://dpaste.com/3GAJFZF
[10:02:34] <NeedSomeHelp> hello when I try to have a "select: function(event, ui)" in a jquery ui autocomplete function, I get Unexpected identifier. What can cause this?
[10:13:58] <doug64k> NeedSomeHelp: need to see more
[10:14:52] <doug64k> NeedSomeHelp: most likely an issue with the commas in that object literal
[10:16:52] <NeedSomeHelp> Good call, thank you.
[11:23:24] <mintux> why fadeIn doesn't work here? http://jsfiddle.net/fgtrc1zq/2/
[11:25:30] <mintux> any idea?
[11:38:21] <shoky> mintux: because it's already visible, and because you shouldn't use onclick attributes. http://jsfiddle.net/fgtrc1zq/4/
[12:01:20] <Paradisee> shoky: you there?
[12:05:21] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/21M126V line 19 someone can please explain how to do that?

[13:34:59] <Xatenev> Heya guys
[13:35:09] <Xatenev> I am having trouble using the fadeOut() together with remove()
[13:35:20] <Xatenev> it doesnt seem to show the fadeOut effect and instantly removes the object
[13:35:22] <Xatenev> any issues known about this?
[13:36:12] <Xatenev> I already tried using timeout and callback
[13:36:17] <Xatenev> but it still seems to instantly remove the object .(
[13:57:37] <kolban> @Xatenev Can you paste your code to jsFiddle?
[14:47:53] <Xatenev> Heya guys
[14:49:17] <Xatenev> I got a huge problem using fadeout together with timeout
[14:49:25] <Xatenev> http://pastebin.com/1h5b1bVQ
[14:49:35] <Xatenev> sometimes its fading the elements out the right way
[14:49:41] <Xatenev> some times the elements get instnatly removed?
[14:49:49] <Xatenev> Any ideas on that ? o>O
[15:03:10] <IrishLimey> Xatenev> Why are you doing a setTimeout in the fadeOut's complete callback?
[17:52:18] <giraffeslacks> Hi everyone. I'm trying to take the value within a <td></td> of each row and use it to calculate another column in the same row. http://jsfiddle.net/f59xzj0j/
[17:52:39] <giraffeslacks> My loop only seems to work on the first row. Why does it not work in each row?
[17:53:16] <giraffeslacks> I thought .each() would work, in isolation, on each of the rows but it doesn't appear to be that way.
[18:06:30] <giraffeslacks> Figured it out. I had to use $(this).
[18:29:12] <tyteen4a03> is there a jquery plugin that does date filtering like this? (is that what it's called?) http://puu.sh/cqHIA/41984947c7.png
[18:53:47] <NeedSomeHelp> How do I put a message in span? <p><input name="name" type="text" id="name"><span class="error"></span></p> I have tried $("#name.error").html("Error!");, but that doesnt work.
[19:07:10] <pastry> $('#name + .error') if you want to keep the same relation

[19:48:54] <slavka`_> hey guys, this may be more of a jquery question .... but im using http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable but the problem is i want to be able to modify the whole element and not just it's inner html... anyone know how i can do that?
[19:57:04] <daniel3_> Hello, if any of you have used fullcalendar.io before.  I have been trying to figure out how to make it when someone clicks a date (any and all dates) it will direct them to a URL that is formatted based off the date they selected (IE: 20141025).
[20:29:07] <ZacHarney> Other than minification, how can optimize the code here: http://jsfiddle.net/zacharney/Lxwm5yqk/ It's a little bit laggy, and if possible, I'd like to make the function an Imediately Invoked Function Expression seeing as it needs to be run as soon as the page loads, but I don't want to have to have the function declared, then call it after, instead have it be declared/defined and called at the same time.
