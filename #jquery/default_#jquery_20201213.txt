[14:07:05] <deltab> nanthencodeneeth: hi! it looks tlike the problem is that you have a click handler that adds another click handler each time it's called
[14:08:44] <nanthencodeneeth> deltab Can you please tell me how can i modify that to avoid that error.I am new to jquery
[14:15:16] <deltab> I think the simplest way to fix it would be to remove the lines  $("#add"+tablemap[m]).click(function(){
[14:15:27] <deltab> and the matching  });
[14:16:11] <deltab> and to change   $('.c').click(function () {   to   $(document).click('.c', function () {
[14:16:44] <deltab> that will set up one click handler for all .c buttons, present and future
[14:16:59] <deltab> I have to go now. good luck!

[18:13:40] <nanthencodeneeth> @deltab have you checked my corrected pastebin  https://pastebin.com/s0mtGHa3
[18:13:42] <deltab> okay, so when are you setting up the click handler?
[18:15:25] <deltab> if you do it before creating the element, then $('.del') is empty and there are no matching elements to add the click handler to
[18:16:00] <deltab> you can use  $(document).click('.del', function ...)  to deal with that
[18:16:57] <nanthencodeneeth> can i use it inside   $(document).ready(

[23:56:00] <robertmaxrees> nanthencodeneeth then why track anything via js?  if it's a normal form, only the inputs that exist when you submit will get submitted.
