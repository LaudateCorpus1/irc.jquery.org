[01:10:08] <W0LF> anyone free to take a look at a piece of code I almost have working, but not quite - to hide other li's when a new one is clicked?
[01:10:24] <W0LF> I made a pastebin here - https://pastebin.com/SCSgJx2N
[01:52:11] <Cork> W0LF: make a jsfddle
[01:58:02] <W0LF> Cork: ok one sec
[06:30:17] <Guest4666> Hello! I need a little noobs help. On my scope I have the following varaibles(based on chrome debugger): Local this: input#get_info with the property "name: "get_info"". That's what the debugger sais. But when I execute the following function: https://pastebin.com/UN3aXRxC it prints: "name is: undefined"
[06:32:29] <Guest4666> anyways: .attr('name')
[06:42:20] <Woet> Guest12243: www.jsfiddle.net
[06:42:25] <Woet> please create a working test case.
[06:58:54] <Cork> he has already left...
[06:59:04] <Cork> and the problem was that he used $().name
[06:59:21] <Cork> (instead of this.name or $(this).prop('name'))
[07:00:38] <Woet> oh, too many guest nicknames
[07:00:59] <Cork> ya, guest nicks are a pain
[07:01:24] <Woet> considering writing a bot that tells people to create a test case when they link gist.github / pastebin / etc
[07:01:39] <Woet> i think it spent 50% of my time asking that
[07:02:05] <Cork> ya, but not sure it will work, ppl tend to ignore those bots (seen from other channels)
[07:02:33] <Woet> we'll find out
[07:02:45] <Cork> and also pastebin and the like isn't always wrong
[07:02:52] <Cork> depends on what the question is
[07:02:56] <Woet> for #jquery I feel like it is, 90% of the time
[07:03:03] <Cork> ya
[07:03:19] <Woet> usually people will find their issue while creating the fiddle in the first place
[07:03:26] <Woet> cause they can't reproduce it with the code they wanted to paste
[07:10:17] <Cork> ya i know
[07:10:31] <Cork> it is normally my comment about the subject too
[07:11:13] <Cork> but that isn't unique to jquery or js, most languages you often find the problem if you try to reproduce it in a clean environment
[09:28:42] <spinningCat> hey
[09:28:49] <spinningCat> what am i doing wrong here https://hastebin.com/ralenajugi.js
[09:29:52] <Cork> spinningCat: context
[09:29:58] <Cork> what is "wrong"?
[09:30:12] <spinningCat> i cannot send data to the backend
[09:30:17] <spinningCat> gave me 500
[09:30:39] <Cork> well you're not sending json
[09:30:45] <Cork> your sending params
[09:30:53] <Cork> json is data: JSON.stringify({})
[09:30:59] <spinningCat> do i need json.parse
[09:31:16] <Cork> ya, but that is for data from the server
[09:31:20] <Cork> not to
[09:31:27] <spinningCat> i suppose ajax will automativally tanslate to json format
[09:31:31] <Cork> it won't
[09:31:52] <spinningCat> from client to server i need json.stringify?
[09:32:03] <Cork> JSON.stringify ya
[09:32:09] <spinningCat> I see
[09:34:19] <spinningCat> it send data null  i dont get it
[09:35:34] <Cork> spinningCat: what are you giving it?
[09:35:59] <spinningCat> a string
[09:36:10] <Cork> i mean what is the code looking like now
[09:37:04] <spinningCat> https://hastebin.com/emolaxobos.js
[09:37:20] <Cork> that isn't valid
[09:37:41] <Cork> you need to give JSON.stringify the object you want to make into json
[09:39:40] <spinningCat>  data: JSON.stringify( number ), is correct now?
[09:39:44] <Cork> no
[09:39:56] <Cork> just give the object you gave to data: to JSON.stringify
[09:42:17] <spinningCat> that is what i did right?
[09:42:22] <spinningCat> i dont understand
[09:42:29] <Cork> spinningCat: the data format is changed a bit cause /echo/json/ expects the json inside param
[09:42:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/jos50bue/6/
[09:42:35] <Cork> but that is what you need to do
[09:42:39] <Cork> and no, it is not what you did
[09:43:02] <spinningCat> uh
[09:43:46] <spinningCat> i didnt use ajax since a while
[09:43:53] <spinningCat> did style change?
[09:43:57] <Cork> no
[09:44:15] <Cork> for param strings you do data: { key: value, key2: value }
[09:44:21] <Cork> for _json_ you need to encode it
[09:44:48] <Cork> as ajax only handles response data for json by default
[09:45:48] <spinningCat> still goes as null
[09:45:54] <spinningCat> it may be about asp.net issue
[09:46:06] <Cork> check what the server expects
[09:46:18] <spinningCat> it expect string
[09:46:27] <Cork> that isn't even possible
[09:46:46] <Cork> it either expects www-form-encoding, or param string in the url or json, or xml or...
[09:46:47] <spinningCat> why not?
[09:46:51] <Cork> "string" is not an option
[09:46:56] <spinningCat> hmm
[09:47:02] <Cork> cause you need to have something to reference it with
[09:47:51] <Cork> (well it is technically possible, but very VERY unlikely)
[10:05:58] <ceiba__> excuse me
[10:06:04] <ceiba__> what am i doing wrong here
[10:06:05] <ceiba__>  data: {"badnumber" : number},
[10:08:49] <AdamPDotty> We can only guess.
[10:09:13] <ceiba__> what is your guess
[10:09:36] <AdamPDotty> Ok, I bluffed. I suck at guessing.
[10:09:48] <ceiba__> :D
[10:10:25] <Cork> ceiba__: you have absolutely no context there at all
[10:10:49] <Cork> but as it has data: i would guess at you're trying to send it over ajax
[10:11:01] <Cork> and the server might not expect it in the format you're sending it?
[10:11:03] <ceiba__> yeah sure
[10:11:15] <ceiba__>      data: '{ "badnumber" : "2-5" }',
[10:11:20] <ceiba__> that one worked
[10:12:15] <Cork> sounds like this is more a server question then a js question
[10:12:16] <ceiba__> that worked https://hastebin.com/jadazogome.js
[10:12:28] <AdamPDotty> so server might expect a string and you were actually sending a number in the other example
[10:12:44] <ceiba__> ah i see
[10:29:40] <Levin^> hello there
[10:29:42] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/pKeLjq
[10:30:01] <Levin^> why applying .css() like I did doesn't work?
[10:31:31] <AdamPDotty> The page you were looking for doesn't exist in ETL.
[10:33:49] <Levin^> try this link: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MXpVbd
[10:34:03] <Levin^> I think it was an error on codepen
[10:35:22] <Cork> Levin^: you can't subtract from a string
[10:36:02] <Cork> either use "calc(100% - " + $textBoxSize + ")" or you need to convert it to a fix number
[10:37:01] <Cork> currently you're doing .css("width", NaN)
[10:39:31] <Levin^> I tried using calc() but I think I did it wrong?
[10:39:34] <Levin^> let me try again
[10:41:16] <Cork> (btw why are you putting $ infront of the variable names... this isn't php...)
[10:41:36] <Levin^> I'm newbie on jquery :P
[10:42:45] <Levin^> yea, didn't work either
[10:42:45] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MXpVbd
[10:43:08] <Levin^> I also tried adding px at the end, but that also failed
[10:45:16] <Cork> ok, what exactly are you trying to do?
[10:45:27] <Cork> cause the code works as it should
[10:47:59] <Cork> Levin^: https://jsfiddle.net/6f9scy38/3/
[10:48:10] <Cork> i would quite strongly recommend you to look into flexbox though
[10:56:32] <Levin^> what you did work well, thanks :)
[10:56:49] <Levin^> wait, flexbox can handle unknown width elements?
[11:00:50] <jomofcw> Hello !
[11:01:21] <jomofcw> A change event will bubble to its ancestor as the other event do, right ?
[11:02:14] <jomofcw> I've got a .on('change','input',function(){console.log('change');}) on one of the ancestor, but the "change" log never appear...
[11:03:53] <jomofcw> Wrong ancestor :x my bad ^^.
[11:04:10] <AdamPDotty> yw
[11:04:46] <Cork> Levin^: what you have there isn't unknown though
[11:05:11] <jomofcw> AdamPDotty :P
[11:05:55] <jomofcw> erf, change trigger only on blur :/... so i shall use the keyUp/Down event to catch the user typing :/...
[11:06:18] <Cork> Levin^: https://jsfiddle.net/6f9scy38/6/
[11:12:02] <Levin^> Cork: oh, I don't recognize those css properties
[11:12:29] <Levin^> flex: 0 1 auto is new to me, gonna read about it
[11:37:58] <Cork> Levin^: can shrink but not expand
[11:53:54] <Levin^> Cork: shrink is what I needed :)
[15:00:30] <W0LF> anyone have a sec to look at this fiddle and see what I'm doing wrong to add a class based on scroll position? http://jsfiddle.net/MFUw3/4535/
[15:01:31] <robertmaxrees> W0LF http://jsfiddle.net/MFUw3/4536/
[15:01:34] <robertmaxrees> seems ot be working fine.
[15:01:57] <robertmaxrees> though you had some random chars in there that were causing an error.
[15:02:06] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: on my fiddle it doesn't show the class added
[15:02:18] <robertmaxrees> W0LF your original fiddle has a js error.
[15:02:29] <robertmaxrees> $('.a').addClass('timbers');dddd
[15:02:34] <robertmaxrees> remove the dddd and voila
[15:03:45] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: hmm, could you send me a link? i removed that but still not seeing anything work besides the alert i commented out
[15:04:14] <robertmaxrees> W0LF how are you confirming?
[15:04:33] <robertmaxrees> i ask because i already sent over http://jsfiddle.net/MFUw3/4536/
[15:04:35] <robertmaxrees> which works fine.
[15:06:04] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: hitting run and then looking at the html window, and then inspecting in the browser
[15:06:24] <W0LF> ok, it def works on your link...i've done something funky on  my tab i guess
[15:06:29] <W0LF> thanks so much!
[15:06:38] <robertmaxrees> W0LF yeah, you've got 'dddd' in yours
[15:07:00] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/8MRFl2f.png
[15:07:18] <W0LF> i removed that in mine, and hit run again, and it still didn't work though
[15:07:38] <W0LF> any idea if the document.ready part is essential to the code working?
[15:07:47] <robertmaxrees> depends on where you're running it.
[15:07:58] <robertmaxrees> that particular code on js fiddle?  nah.
[15:14:49] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: hmm...i've tried to implement that code live on dowellconsulting.com - to add the "timbers" class to the #backtotop id for the scroll back to top button when the viewscreen gets to the bottom, but it doesn't seem to work.
[15:15:03] <W0LF> i've checked the console and the code is there...just no class gets added
[15:16:16] <robertmaxrees> where's the js?
[15:17:58] <robertmaxrees> also: have you validated to make sure that if is doing what  you think it's doing?
[15:19:14] <W0LF> scripts > js_Tp9p...
[15:19:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, found it in the compiled js
[15:19:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd get some logging in before that if.
[15:19:59] <W0LF> yup, I made an updated fiddle here that basically approximates the behavior with the same names
[15:20:11] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: hmm, how do I do that?
[15:20:18] <robertmaxrees> add logging?
[15:20:22] <robertmaxrees> console.log?
[15:20:33] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: I know how to add an alert to fire off to test if something works, but I'm still learning ><
[15:20:43] <robertmaxrees> oh, don't use alerts for that.
[15:20:50] <robertmaxrees> use console.log
[15:20:57] <robertmaxrees> and then use your browser's dev tools
[15:21:14] <W0LF> do I add "console.log" to the jquery code?
[15:21:27] <robertmaxrees> *javascript, and it's like any other function call.
[15:21:33] <robertmaxrees> console.log(foo);
[15:22:24] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/MFUw3/4544/
[15:22:29] <W0LF> http://jsfiddle.net/MFUw3/4545/
[15:22:43] <robertmaxrees> lol;
[15:22:53] <robertmaxrees> right, now replace foo with whatever you want to log out.,
[15:23:21] <W0LF> http://jsfiddle.net/MFUw3/4547/
[15:23:43] <robertmaxrees> :) you try that?
[15:23:53] <W0LF> not yet, changing it now
[15:24:11] <robertmaxrees> also: you'll want to start storing some of those repeated $() calls into vars.
[15:25:41] <W0LF> that'll help with performance or something?
[15:25:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/MFUw3/4553/
[15:26:03] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: ok updated on the site, now how do i use the log?
[15:26:18] <robertmaxrees> W0LF open your browser's developer tools, click "console"
[15:26:22] <robertmaxrees> and scroll
[15:28:57] <W0LF> hmm...nothing. so that means none of the code is meeting the criteria to activate?
[15:29:12] <Nirvash> Has anyone ever used https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/quicksearch before?
[15:29:25] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: sorry ^ up there
[15:29:26] <robertmaxrees> that means the scoll handler isn't getting bound W0LF
[15:29:47] <robertmaxrees> W0LF http://jsfiddle.net/MFUw3/4555/ try this.
[15:30:24] <robertmaxrees> Nirvash it's got some stars and forks and watchers... are you looking for feedback on it or for help?
[15:32:46] <Nirvash> I've noticed it's really slow on larger data sets, and didn't know if anyone had an idea as to what could cause it
[15:33:22] <robertmaxrees> Nirvash could be all kinds of things.
[15:33:43] <robertmaxrees> the machine, the dom, styles, etc.
[15:33:44] <Nirvash> Yeah
[15:33:49] <robertmaxrees> you could perf test it yourself pretty easily.
[15:33:59] <Nirvash> Oh?
[15:34:05] <W0LF> robertmaxrees:  okay, still nothing. there should be some log stuff popping up in the console section, right?
[15:34:25] <robertmaxrees> W0LF yeah.  if there's not, then your code isn't running at all.
[15:35:17] <gambl0re> anyone here use ubuntu?
[15:35:44] <robertmaxrees> hit up #ubuntu
[15:37:36] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[15:44:53] <W0LF> robertmaxrees:  thanks for your help - I'm just trying to track down why/where in the files, etc. it's not being put in correctly. Though since it's in the compressed js file it...should be working? As in, if it weren't in the file I'd understand the file itself wasn't being loaded. But the code is there, it's just not activating on the page for some reason
[15:46:10] <robertmaxrees> W0LF you using drupal or somethijng?
[15:46:12] <robertmaxrees> *something
[15:46:26] <robertmaxrees> because it looks like you might need to call some kind of init method.
[15:46:50] <W0LF> robertmaxrees:  yes, but I thought I was using the right headers already...I'll post a pastebin
[15:47:42] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: https://pastebin.com/M7u1sUpD
[15:48:02] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: and it's listed correctly in the info.ml and libraries files
[15:48:19] <W0LF> though i'm triple checking now
[15:50:23] <robertmaxrees> "the right headers"?
[15:50:35] <robertmaxrees> try killing that doc ready.
[15:50:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if you've got bad markup somwehre.
[15:50:52] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: sorry, just meant the top...part
[15:51:48] <robertmaxrees> (function ($) { Drupal.behaviors.js = { ?
[15:52:15] <robertmaxrees> do you have multiple instances of Drupal.behaviors.js = {} being used?
[15:53:50] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:34:56] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:27:23] <janiator> ´ncaught TypeError: $.post is not a function... Any suggestions? I am uing the minified version not slim
[17:28:45] <robertmaxrees> console.log($.fn.jquery);
[17:29:07] <janiator> 3.3.1
[17:39:52] <Levin^> peace
[17:52:19] <robertmaxrees> janiator sorry was away for a sec
[17:53:11] <robertmaxrees> could you link to where you downloaded jquery from?
[17:58:47] <W0LF> anyone know why my back to top button on dowellconsulting.com won't fade in/out correctly, but it does on kobejet.com?
[17:59:14] <robertmaxrees> W0LF link to the relevant code?
[18:01:05] <robertmaxrees> also: the transition CSS property is conflicting with jquery on dowell
[18:01:35] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: I've checked the "backtotop" module code itself (identical between both sites), and one by one eliminated my custom js files, css files, and even the info and libraries and nothing brings it back to fading correctly
[18:01:48] <robertmaxrees> it's not a js issue.
[18:01:51] <robertmaxrees> it's a css issue.
[18:01:53] <W0LF> transition set on what element?
[18:01:59] <robertmaxrees> #backtotop\
[18:02:02] <robertmaxrees> *no \
[18:03:12] <W0LF> ahh, i see - i just toggled it off, and it works again... any suggestions how to implement a transition when the jquery for an element already does some sort of delay?
[18:03:34] <robertmaxrees> use js or css./
[18:03:49] <robertmaxrees> pick one and use only it :)
[18:05:13] <W0LF> robertmaxrees: hmm...tricky because the conflict is in the module's code
[18:05:36] <W0LF> can you supercede other js code with later code like you can with css?
[18:05:51] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[18:06:44] <W0LF> solved! instead of applying "transition: all" i just did "transition: bottom" =)
[18:07:04] <W0LF> thanks again robert, i wasn't even checking the global css
[18:08:04] <robertmaxrees> why are you transitioning at all via css?
[19:01:53] <gambl0re> hello?
[19:04:59] <robertmaxrees> over 300 people in here :)
[19:55:41] <artemisiaa> hello, i'm looking for some help.. i'd like to get a counter that increased by a certain amount every second
[19:56:23] <artemisiaa> say it starts at 100, and every second it adds 10, it would have to be running continuously so that it would be higher the next time a visitor comes to the page
[19:57:08] <artemisiaa> seems like such a simple thing but I can't find anything good online
[22:49:42] <artemisiaa> hi! can i pay someone to code something really simple for me? tried to find it and no luck.. it's a simple number counter
[22:50:46] <artemisiaa> it should start at a certain number at a certain date and increment by a set amount every second.. have a simple number animation as well
[22:59:22] <GeekMonkey> I came across this site that has a google map with the reviews https://customchirocare.pairsite.com/contact-us/
[22:59:41] <GeekMonkey> Does anyone know if that is possible with the google map api... no iframe
[23:01:39] <pavonia> artemisiaa: What part are you having problems with?
[23:02:39] <artemisiaa> pavonia: I can't make it look pretty and I'm having trouble having it increment by the right amount
[23:04:00] <pavonia> Show some code?
[23:04:03] <artemisiaa> i found this that is close
[23:04:04] <artemisiaa> https://jsfiddle.net/z1Lg7sd4/1/
[23:05:04] <GeekMonkey> Any thoughts on the google map api?
