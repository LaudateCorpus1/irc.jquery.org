[03:30:50] <Serg_Penguin> hi ! is where any definitive text on inheritance of jQuery plugins ? or is where a helper method for inheritance in jQuery, like Crockford's on (is it outdated ? )

[04:23:28] <DummyHead> Hi small question. Doing a getJson request but i'm getting a Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : from the returned json. I'm having trouble understanding why this would be an issue
[04:27:58] <DummyHead> Nvm solved it cuz the callback was borking it
[04:32:45] <pyemkey> Hello, I would be appreciated if someone could look into in my fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/cunn9rkq/43/ and help me figure out how to fix the code. First of all I don't want to get solution. Only what I want to get is fishing rod  I simulate ajax calls in my example. How it should work? When I click on the bookmark button, first spinner should appear, then I should see info that Job offer saved. When I click on the remove jo
[04:32:46] <pyemkey> b offer (here should be better name ) header should change to Job offer is removing. After that I should see Job offer removed. I'm aware that this code is not best, but practice makes perfect. How can I improve this piece of code
[05:33:58] <everson> Hi. With a login page (which has a username <input type='text' /> and a password <input type='password' />, is it dangerous to use $.ajax to submit the POST request? Or should I rather stick with the old school HTML <form action='...'> and <input type='submit'> button approach? (I am using the necessary HTTPS and server-side password hashing precautions)
[06:25:25] <tuskkk___> to get the parent object in ajax success I tried, var self = $(this); but its not a jQuery object anymore
[06:32:33] <arc_> tuskkk___ the parent object of what
[06:35:56] <tuskkk___> object we get in 'this' when we do $('.selector').on('event', function() { ----here----  });
[06:37:49] <tuskkk___> never mind, I got it.
[06:37:50] <arc_> tuskkk___ okay, so i assume the ajax call is inside that event binding?
[06:37:53] <arc_> heh ok
[06:39:41] <tuskkk___> arc_: yes it is
[07:34:02] <jose3> hey
[07:44:58] <spexi> Hi! Is it possible to create a slider, that has values for example between 0 and 50, but there can be defined some "default steps" where the slider could possibly snap? I'm creating a tax calculator, and user should be able to select any tax percentage he/she wants, but there could be pre-defined some defaults that exists in my country
[07:56:16] <anotheryou> spexi, search for some library. I had a nice one, give me a second
[07:57:23] <anotheryou> spexi, i used this one: http://refreshless.com/nouislider/
[07:58:09] <anotheryou> to much pre-defined style for my taste, but works well :)
[08:08:52] <TECFALL> i have a table with rows of class "myclass" I want to be able to find those
[08:08:57] <TECFALL> oops
[08:09:55] <TECFALL> i have a table with rows of class "myclass" I want to be able to find those 'tr' and bind a click function to all 'td' of that row except the 'td' in that 'tr'
[08:10:17] <TECFALL> except the LAST 'td in that 'tr' ***
[08:11:22] <TECFALL> is there a way to do this with a single selector or do i need to do an each function on each tr
[08:12:47] <decx> spexi: on range change go through your snap array and check if your value is smaller than array element + snap and bigger than element - snap
[08:32:07] <sigdk> hello. I'm not sure if this is a java or a jquery question but I 'll give it a try here. I am doing an ajax call to the backend. Assume something goes wrong there or data sent is invalid, so I expect it to answer with a simple html/text message informing me about it.
[08:32:53] <sigdk> looking at the network tab in chrome, it seems that I do get the correct response, but this is not rendered on my screen...
[08:33:09] <sigdk> Hmm... I'm not sure if that's clear
[09:11:00] <Duikb00t> aight
[09:11:10] <Duikb00t> Anyone an idea
[09:11:10] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/pjzydp/
[09:11:24] <Duikb00t> My fieldsets is an array with the id names like id="facebook" in the example.
[09:11:41] <Duikb00t> How can I count how many fieldsets there are in #facebook?
[09:14:31] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: that should be correct, given your value is actually "facebook"
[09:14:47] <Duikb00t> But its counting wrong
[09:14:52] <Duikb00t> always 0
[09:15:33] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: how about .find('fieldset').length
[09:15:48] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/eeutfb/  ( full code )
[09:16:44] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: does console.log(value) actually return facebook as a string or something else?
[09:16:59] <Duikb00t> Im now trying your find solution
[09:17:02] <Duikb00t> so find and then .length?
[09:17:10] <Duikb00t> console.log( $('#'+value).find('fieldset').length);
[09:17:14] <Uhkis> oh i'm blind, your console.log there is missing $()
[09:17:22] <Duikb00t> yeah that's fix
[09:17:23] <Duikb00t> ed
[09:18:00] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: you're missing space in that if too
[09:18:15] <Duikb00t> console.log( $('#'+value).find('fieldset').length);  here ?
[09:18:19] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: that if reads: $('#facebookfieldset')
[09:18:46] <Duikb00t> console.log( $('#'+value + ' ').find('fieldset').length);
[09:19:06] <Uhkis> if ( $('#'+value+ ' fieldset').length <= 1){
[09:19:31] <Uhkis> and you shouldn't have duplicate id's on your page.
[09:19:51] <Duikb00t> I don't have duplicate ids
[09:19:58] <Uhkis> and this would be a lot easier on jsfiddle.net
[09:20:05] <Duikb00t> I have to check the fieldsets inside fieldset #facebook
[09:20:19] <Uhkis> $('fieldset #remove') really sounds like there's more than one #remove
[09:20:46] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/zzsmcp/
[09:21:07] <Duikb00t> oh yes but that will be fixed ;)
[09:21:40] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: make a fiddle, this is very unproductive
[09:23:25] <Duikb00t> Uhkis:  https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/wsnjnsyd/
[09:24:02] <Duikb00t> I want only to show a Remove button when the is more then 1 fieldset rendered in every 'section' ( section is like fieldset #facebook )
[09:24:38] <Duikb00t> * Use this https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/wsnjnsyd/1/
[09:26:04] <Duikb00t> Other update https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/wsnjnsyd/2/ ;)
[09:36:01] <Duikb00t> Sweet this is already better ;) https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/wsnjnsyd/
[09:58:21] <FancyCamel> Hey there, I'm a JS noob writing a small jQuery function and I am just super sure that it's a horribly inefficient way to do this and was hoping I can get some guidance for the future because I don't want to keep creating inefficient functions, haha.
[09:58:27] <FancyCamel> https://dpaste.de/H0k1 The user can add to this patient list and then save it. But if they add to it, I know that the new ones won't have the bound event listeners because they werent in the dom on the document ready
[09:58:33] <FancyCamel> But triggering tag-del:bind every time seems horribly inefficient because it's rebinding them ALL all over again as opposed to just adding the binding to one
[09:59:59] <decx> scrap bind
[10:00:08] <decx> use on
[10:00:10] <decx> success
[10:00:40] <FancyCamel> Doesn't that still require it to be on the dom initially when the .ready() fires to have it bound ?
[10:01:02] <decx> no you just tell your ul to listen for bubbling clicks from .del
[10:01:12] <decx> no need to rebind eventlisteners for every thing
[10:01:32] <decx> ul.on('click', '.del', fn)
[10:02:07] <FancyCamel> Oh, huh.
[10:02:56] <FancyCamel> So since the ul is there it listens to any of that class clicked regardless of if the dom element was added after the listener was.
[10:03:02] <FancyCamel> That's pretty neat.
[10:03:05] <decx> right
[10:03:10] <decx> thaat's the point of delegation
[10:04:47] <FancyCamel> And $(this) refers to the delete button, so I can use $(this).parent() when getting the li I want to remove from the ul. Awesome. Thanks decx  :)
[10:05:17] <decx> right either parent or closest()
[10:05:21] <jose3> How do I use jquery to make a statement like this:  if (data.element.val() === '')
[10:05:30] <jose3> But instead of value i want to use id
[10:05:46] <decx> wat
[10:05:56] <jose3>  if (data.element.id() === "" can I make something like that? data.element.id() ?
[10:06:03] <decx> element is a jquery element
[10:06:15] <decx> then you need data.element.prop('id')
[10:06:36] <jose3> an I can test a divs id ?
[10:19:05] <jose3> like this : if (data.element.prop('id') === "events-panel") { ?
[10:20:18] <ericx2x> Hey guys, anyone familiar with tweenlight or greensock?
[10:20:37] <ericx2x> I don't understand why anyone would want to use this plugin when you can accomplish any animation you'd like with straight up jquer
[10:32:34] <decx> marketing
[10:33:04] <Duikb00t> I used it years ago for AS3.0
[10:33:08] <Duikb00t> Never in JS.
[10:33:10] <decx> they spent years building the thing, now they have to convince people that css3 isnt killing them in every regard
[10:36:32] <DeltaHeavy> decx ericx2x Greensock is good because it makes use of hardware acceleration. You therefore get GPU powered animations rather than just CPU which are super super slow and not very smooth even if you were on hardware it wouldn't choke up.
[10:36:48] <DeltaHeavy> CSS3 doesn't have Greensock beat in every regard because it's useful for interactive animations.
[10:36:50] <decx> yeah i can do my own transform calls thanks
[10:36:55] <DeltaHeavy> CSS3 is only good for UI type stuffs.
[10:37:06] <DeltaHeavy> decx Have fun making it interactive then :p
[10:37:09] <DeltaHeavy> Cause you can't.
[10:37:10] <decx> we had this same topic the other way around the other day ;)
[10:37:23] <decx> where i convinced you that sometimes pure css aint enough
[10:37:24] <decx> ^^
[10:37:34] <DeltaHeavy> I wasn't saying Greensock was bad, I was just previously saying CSS3 animations are a good "default" and if you can't sanely do it with them you might need Greensock.
[10:37:51] <decx> it's just not relevant to me, they core market are old as devs
[10:37:56] <decx> their
[10:38:04] <DeltaHeavy> decx Why is their core market "old"?
[10:38:11] <decx> old action script devs
[10:38:26] <DeltaHeavy> Greensock is a very relevant JS lib for modern webdev.
[10:38:47] <decx> whatever
[10:38:56] <DeltaHeavy> What's with the attitude :p ?
[10:39:16] <decx> i dont care about greensock, it's not relevant to me
[10:39:38] <DeltaHeavy> Kk, thought that was kind of directed at me. And I know what you mean, I haven't touched it and I'm not eager to try it until I need to.
[10:40:01] <decx> i just know that my old dev buddies who did a lot of flash have loved it for years
[10:46:27] <decx> DeltaHeavy: btw i just helped someone out the other day in here with something remotely relevant  https://jsfiddle.net/decx/8487uurp/
[10:46:44] <decx> contrieved example but whatevs
[10:46:58] <DeltaHeavy> That's pretty cool.
[10:47:20] <decx> using distance for duration calc seems to work out okish
[10:48:28] <FancyCamel> Is there any problem with adding data to a hidden input ?
[10:48:41] <decx> shouldnt
[10:48:46] <FancyCamel> I'm trying to troubleshoot why my data might not be adding to my element.
[10:51:54] <islalobo> Does this makes sense: (obj.reminder.adhMedicationAlert != 'undefined') I keep getting an error "obj.reminder.adhMedicationAlert is undefined"
[10:54:52] <FancyCamel> Sigh
[10:54:58] <FancyCamel> It's just that the data isn't showing on the dom.
[10:55:06] <decx> wouldnt anyway
[10:55:45] <FancyCamel> Well, I mean, I'm used to seeing data-foo="bar".
[10:55:53] <FancyCamel> So if you add data programatically, it doesn't shwo though ?
[10:55:58] <FancyCamel> show*
[10:56:09] <decx> right
[10:56:16] <FancyCamel> Just to mess with me. ;)
[10:56:21] <FancyCamel> But thanks again, heh.
[10:56:37] <decx> no what you see in your inspector is just the current state the browser uses to build the actual dom
[10:58:11] <Surfoo> Hello, I have a TypeError with .on() and an object: http://pastebin.com/jaAwP8Si
[10:58:23] <decx> oh well i just tried it out and my inspector shows the new value so i have no idea ^^
[10:58:45] <Surfoo> I'd like to call an other method in my object, but "this" is wrong
[10:58:58] <Filystyn> Im fucking doing jquery quests on codecademy
[10:59:05] <Filystyn> feels like i mastered it all!!!!!
[10:59:08] <Surfoo> It's from my button, not my object
[10:59:10] <Filystyn> <BOSSS>
[11:01:23] <decx> that's just what these eventlistener functions do
[11:01:36] <decx> this is the element t
[11:02:03] <Surfoo> yes, but I don't want to use it
[11:02:21] <Surfoo> I'd to call an other method in my object
[11:02:24] <decx> call it inside
[11:02:59] <Surfoo> how?
[11:04:31] <Filystyn> Im slowly turning INTO A FUCKING JQUERY KAMI
[11:05:19] <decx> Surfoo: what do you mean how, just function(e) { main.beforesubmit(e)}
[11:18:01] <thisismyname> Hi, guys. Does anyone know a jquery plugin that will accomplish the page fading transition effect like on this site? http://www.studiometa.fr/
[11:19:29] <decx> what you mean the paternoster scrolling?
[11:21:18] <thisismyname> Yes
[11:21:47] <decx> that's the kind of thing you handcraft for a specific contentstructure
[11:22:16] <decx> most plugins are general purpose
[11:22:49] <thisismyname> Do you notice that a new section of the page appears when scrolling using the mouse?
[11:23:07] <thisismyname> fullpage.js is similar, but it is sliding instead of fading. http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/
[11:23:25] <decx> that's just a snap to offset
[11:23:44] <decx> get scroll events, transition to next viable snap
[11:26:17] <thisismyname> There isn't any known plugin to do the same? I'm not that good at jQuery to make one similar.
[11:51:50] <jose3> radio stars and radio fun!

[11:52:02] <robertmaxrees> wait...
[11:59:49] <bango2> need an input on your website? use radio!
[12:00:02] <bango2> 5% of the time, it works every time
[12:00:10] <FancyCamel> But what if my users don't listen to the radio
[12:00:46] <bango2> hmm.. checkboxes is the nest best thing

[12:22:59] <decx> my clients in prague dont like radio buttons they want czech boxes

[14:01:09] <jose3> robert!
[14:01:58] <jose3> What is wrong here? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/009e166dafa0c14c136b
[14:02:33] <jose3> The problem is I have a panel that comes down. However on the initial click the slide down is not animated, it just appears. How can I remove the hidden class while keeping it animated?
[14:24:31] <Sagar> i have span class="user1" "user2" and so on contain data-id="1" "2" and so on,,, what i want to achieve is to fetch the data from ajax and add them one by one to <span class="data1"></span> class="data2" and so on....
[14:24:52] <Sagar> i want to add data respective to each of it's id
[14:25:05] <Sagar> but my script add the data to the last DIV
[14:26:29] <robertmaxrees> jose3 did you get the help you wanyted?
[14:26:49] <robertmaxrees> Sagar show your code.
[14:27:09] <Sagar> this is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/8rwod33d/
[14:27:39] <jose3> robertmaxrees:
[14:27:57] <Sagar> it just sets and apend everything at the last span and not the above one
[14:28:04] <jose3> robertmaxrees: Hey, my original code was close, its just missing the 1st click slide down
[14:28:20] <robertmaxrees> Sagar you meant the .text()
[14:28:34] <robertmaxrees> jose3 so you figured it out?
[14:28:54] <Sagar> robertmaxrees: yes, it replaces all the data to the last span
[14:28:56] <jose3> no i just used an even older code, is there a quick solution to it you thib>
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> jose3 don't remove the class at all.  that the slidedown should take care of that for you.
[14:29:23] <robertmaxrees> Sagar also, uid is global.  you need to make that not global.
[14:29:25] <jose3> You are correct
[14:29:36] <jose3> the reason i did it this way though was because of the window load
[14:29:41] <Sagar> robertmaxrees: how do i do that?
[14:29:43] <robertmaxrees> jose3 make a fiddle.
[14:29:49] <robertmaxrees> Sagar put var in front of UID.
[14:29:53] <robertmaxrees> var uid =
[14:29:55] <jose3> if the class doesnt start hidden, then you can see the block and then it hides it
[14:30:01] <Sagar> so that it should reset and set .text in right possible way
[14:30:09] <robertmaxrees> jose3 the css should be hiding it for you by default.
[14:30:23] <jose3> let me see
[14:30:47] <robertmaxrees> Sagar the issue is UID is a global var - you need to properly declare it.
[14:31:25] <Sagar> i think that was the only issue
[14:31:32] <Sagar> i was making it global
[14:31:34] <Sagar> thanks :)
[14:33:40] <robertmaxrees> Sagar do you understand why that was breaking it?
[14:33:51] <jose3> you can see the box hide itself on initial page load
[14:34:02] <robertmaxrees> jose3 your css should be hiding it by default.
[14:34:18] <jose3> via class hidden you mean?
[14:34:19] <Sagar> robertmaxress: because uid was set once as GLOBAL
[14:34:21] <Sagar> yes i got it
[14:34:23] <robertmaxrees> jose3 sure.
[14:34:25] <Sagar> it shouldn't be global
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> Sagar right, because you kept updating that global var before the ajax call finished.
[14:35:38] <robertmaxrees> so when the ajax call finished, it looked at the value of that global var, which would have been at it's "final" value.
[14:36:30] <robertmaxrees> this is why i tell people to write valid code.
[14:36:35] <robertmaxrees> need to use the var keyword.
[14:37:15] <Sagar> Got it
[14:37:30] <Sagar> robertmaxress: trying to short the code
[14:37:40] <robertmaxrees> that's not really an excuse tbqh
[14:37:44] <robertmaxrees> you want valid code always.
[14:37:45] <Sagar> how can i achieve function(data uid) so that data should be data1 data2 and so on
[14:37:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:37:54] <robertmaxrees> for the each?
[14:38:30] <robertmaxrees> or the callback for the ajax call?
[14:38:31] <Sagar> robertmaxresss: OK for the previous code. PERIOD . I want to shortness this new code, that's what i mean
[14:38:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:38:53] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to write shorter code?
[14:38:56] <Sagar> i am trying to make $get to store value in data1 , data2 and so on depending upon the uid
[14:39:16] <robertmaxrees> what's "data1 , data2"?
[14:39:40] <Sagar> robertmaxress: this may give u an example what i am trying to do https://jsfiddle.net/8rwod33d/1/
[14:40:18] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[14:40:29] <Sagar> Why not?
[14:40:40] <robertmaxrees> because you can't define what args get passed to that function.
[14:40:49] <robertmaxrees> you can only define what they're named - jquery specifies what the arguments are.
[14:42:58] <Sagar> why do we have to store all values to data and not in . i think this worked :) https://jsfiddle.net/8rwod33d/2/
[14:43:05] <Sagar> robertmaxress ^ :) https://jsfiddle.net/8rwod33d/2/
[14:43:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:43:36] <robertmaxrees> that isn't doing what you think it is.
[14:43:37] <Sagar>                   var getData = "data" + uid; makes it getData as data + uid :)
[14:43:50] <robertmaxrees> no it doesn't.
[14:44:04] <robertmaxrees> getData is a completely different value inside that function.
[14:44:15] <Sagar> huh?
[14:44:30] <robertmaxrees> }, function(getData) { - that names an argument "getData"
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> that argument has NOTHING do to with the var you declare above.
[14:44:48] <Sagar> :o
[14:45:10] <Sagar> so there is no way i could store the data fetched from $.get into data1 data2 and so on depending upon the uid
[14:45:35] <robertmaxrees> you mean in the data attributes?
[14:45:40] <robertmaxrees> or into vars?
[14:45:44] <Sagar> into data
[14:45:49] <Sagar> assume this
[14:46:01] <robertmaxrees> "into data" doesn't mean anything - what is "data"?
[14:46:44] <Sagar> $.get(apisURL + "/getStats", { uid: uid }, function(data + uid) { alert(data + uid.paid); });
[14:46:44] <robertmaxrees> from what i can tell, you're confused about async programming concepts in general.
[14:46:56] <robertmaxrees> please stoip doing  function(data + uid)  - that doesn't mean anything.
[14:47:03] <robertmaxrees> are you saying you want  function(data, uid)  ?
[14:47:12] <Sagar> NO
[14:47:16] <Sagar> robertmaxress:
[14:47:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you should be writing functions, then.
[14:47:31] <Sagar>  $.get(apisURL + "/getStats", { uid: uid }, function(data) { alert(data.paid); });
[14:47:38] <robertmaxrees> sure.  you can do that.
[14:47:41] <Sagar> u see this stores the data fetched into "data" right?
[14:47:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:48:04] <robertmaxrees> it passes the data fetched into the function via an argument named data.
[14:48:12] <Sagar> yes
[14:48:31] <Sagar> so what i want to achieve foreach should pass argument data + uid i.e data1 data2 and so on
[14:48:36] <Sagar> and store into it
[14:48:45] <Sagar> instead of storing everything into the argument data
[14:48:58] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to append uid to data?
[14:49:03] <Sagar> Yes
[14:49:08] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do that.
[14:49:36] <robertmaxrees> you can create a var in a parent scope and access that.
[14:49:38] <Sagar> so everything goes in data argument
[14:49:42] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:49:47] <robertmaxrees> the data returned goes in the data argument.
[14:50:31] <Sagar> function(data) <--- i want to make that data dynamic so it should be data1 data2 data3 and not data. for each uid
[14:50:45] <robertmaxrees> why?  that's not going to fix anything for you.
[14:50:54] <robertmaxrees> data is the name of the argument.  it has nothing to do with the contents it holds.
[14:51:18] <Sagar> after everything finishes, i mean the $.each loop, the data contains all the data for
[14:51:23] <Sagar> i want to make them seprated
[14:51:27] <robertmaxrees> they are/
[14:51:49] <robertmaxrees> each time an ajax call finishes, that callback will fire with whatever data came back.
[14:51:56] <robertmaxrees> *for that individual ajax call.
[15:01:48] <diegoviola> hi
[15:01:53] <robertmaxrees> hello
[15:02:16] <diegoviola> I'm building some chrome extensions with js/html/css, I want to save the current scrollbar position when I close the extension and when I open it again I want to restore it
[15:02:39] <diegoviola> any ideas how to go in doing this?
[15:03:00] <robertmaxrees> ask in a channel about chrome extensions.
[15:03:21] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to store that info somewhere - not sure what chrome's api is for doing that in a persistent way for extensions.
[15:04:25] <diegoviola> ok ty
[15:05:31] <jose3> Guys when i go into my chrome console i can just type in variables to see their value
[15:05:43] <robertmaxrees> for global vars, yes.
[15:05:44] <jose3> how about if i want to look at all variables?
[15:05:50] <robertmaxrees> you can't see ALL of them.
[15:05:54] <robertmaxrees> but you could see all global vars.
[15:06:01] <jose3> how would i do that?
[15:06:10] <robertmaxrees> why would you want that, out of curiosity?
[15:06:17] <jose3> debugging
[15:06:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good way to debug.
[15:06:49] <jose3> i mean i am trying to see why something is ""
[15:07:01] <jose3> when I expect it to be null or have a value
[15:07:06] <robertmaxrees> use your step debugger for that.
[15:07:23] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[15:30:09] <jose3> hey
[15:32:41] <robertmaxrees> hello
[15:35:59] <jose3> Soooo
[15:36:38] <jose3> I have this broken fiddle , because of my lack of javascript/jquery in it https://jsfiddle.net/fgpy8b1c/
[15:36:59] <robertmaxrees> see the "javascript" title in that panel?
[15:37:15] <robertmaxrees> click that, then click on the "Frameworks & extensions" dropdown and select a version of jquery to use.
[15:37:17] <jose3> yes
[15:37:48] <robertmaxrees> also - $("#guest-register").hide(); do this via CSS.
[15:38:32] <jose3> via css? I did an inline style class='hidden'
[15:38:41] <robertmaxrees> don't use inline styles.
[15:38:47] <robertmaxrees> use a stylesheet.
[15:38:49] <jose3> ok
[15:39:17] <robertmaxrees> and don't link js/css using the html pane - there's an "external resources" option on the left for that.
[15:39:19] <robertmaxrees> use that instead.
[15:40:14] <jose3> O dod ot
[15:41:16] <jose3> it just shows a plus sign, i have to manually get thecdn url ?
[15:41:32] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:41:41] <jose3> oh ok
[15:42:56] <jose3> it works
[15:43:26] <jose3> it doesnt work if i do it inline ???????
[15:43:33] <jose3> but if i set up the style it does ?
[15:43:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:44:00] <jose3> I mean i ve alreay tried this
[15:44:14] <jose3> the 1st time i did this though: <div id="guest-register" class="hidden">
[15:44:25] <robertmaxrees> you haven't made a problem statement.
[15:44:27] <jose3> and it didnt work
[15:44:40] <jose3> now i did it using the stylesheet and it does work
[15:44:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:45:02] <robertmaxrees> did you define "hidden"?
[15:45:25] <jose3> with bootstrap yes
[16:26:54] <robertmaxrees> did you define "hidden"?
[16:26:57] <robertmaxrees> woops
[17:06:38] <scope> hello
[17:07:16] <scope> could some lovely person take a look at this please
[17:07:17] <scope> https://gist.github.com/scope2229/d98e789729a39fd3f270
[17:07:29] <scope> its a jquery-ui.css
[17:08:12] <scope> im using ruby on rails to develop the site but when i goto localhost the calendar wont open
[17:43:09] <robertmaxrees> woops
[20:10:36] <jose3> Howdy, what is wrong with the way I am parsing this?
[20:11:27] <jose3> https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/967ce989c4e8f47e42e4
[20:12:11] <jose3> I am using this function, the 1st one works on PHRASE.TEXT, BUT NOT On meanings.text
[20:13:23] <shoky> jose3: you must always return something from inside .map
[20:13:32] <shoky> jose3: it's not a filter. it maps EVERY item
[20:14:09] <jose3> I am arent I?
[20:14:38] <shoky> jose3: you're only returning something  if currentTranslation.meanings is truthy
[20:15:06] <jose3> so the 1st part works because it is truthy?
[20:15:25] <jose3> I mean why does this line work? (currentTranslation.phrase)
[20:15:28] <shoky> jose3: donno what you mean. but anyways that's not the main isue
[20:15:36] <shoky> jose3: meanings is an array
[20:16:13] <jose3> oh they are nested differently
[20:16:46] <shoky> if you want the first item in it you need [0]
[20:16:50] <shoky> e.g.  .meanings[0].text
[20:17:57] <shoky> jose3:  you probably want:  data.tuc.filter(function(translation) { return translation.meanings }).map(function(translation) { return translation.meanings[0].text })
[20:18:10] <jose3> Yes thats what I want
[20:18:13] <jose3> it works
[20:18:25] <jose3> im just trying to figure it out
[20:18:58] <shoky> why wouldn't  currentTranslation.phrase  wrok?
[20:18:59] <shoky> work
[20:19:17] <shoky> it works because there's a phrase property in those objects
[20:19:32] <jose3> yes I see that its not an array
[20:19:52] <jose3> Thanks!
[20:20:06] <shoky> np
[21:22:14] <CSWookie> Hey folks, if I've got a jquery set, is there a way for me to find out what selector I used to get it?
[21:40:19] <jose3> what do you think is goin on with my js?
[21:41:50] <jose3> I have a function that calls in like 10 other functions. When it gets to a particular one in the middle it says it doesn't exist. This only happens after the 1st load. So the 1st time I press a button the code runs. ANy queries after the 1st, my broswer says:  Uncaught TypeError: synonyms is not a function
[21:42:23] <jose3> So not only DOES the code get run on the first cycle and produce a result, but its also in the same file as the other 9 functions
[21:55:31] <jose3> Can someone tell me why im getting this error? http://cl.ly/3e0w1s0D0p05
[23:03:32] <aro> is there a way to apply a pseudo class to a select element if it has an option with a non empty value selected?
