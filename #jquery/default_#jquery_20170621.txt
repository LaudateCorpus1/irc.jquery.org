[00:25:40] <juria_roberts> How do I check if a checkbox exists and then whether its checked?
[00:25:51] <juria_roberts> i have given the checkbox an id
[00:36:08] <pavonia> if ($("#myid:checked").length) { ... }
[00:42:58] <juria_roberts> pavonia: my use case is if it exists then it has to be checked...if it doesn't exist it doesnt matter
[00:43:11] <juria_roberts> sorry should have mentioned that earlier
[00:45:42] <pavonia> juria_roberts: By "it has to be checked" you mean you want to check if it is checked, or you want to set the checked property?
[00:46:07] <juria_roberts> pavonia: to check if its checked
[00:48:18] <pavonia> The above test is true if the checkbox exists and is checked
[00:49:29] <juria_roberts> pavonia: got it...your solution will work...Thank you
[01:05:51] <alturic> Hey guys, when $.ajax POSTing is it supposed to convert characters to entities? In other words should this: This is 3" and this is <script>alert('hacked');</script> heh. 'sometimes   be POSTed exactly as is or no?
[01:18:13] <pavonia> alturic: You can set the encoding via the contentType field, I think
[01:19:34] <alturic> pavonia: I mean, is this a "weird" use-case? Everyone I've talked to so far said yea you should be getting exactly what was submitted... but I'm not since the PHP side of $_POST is getting entities, so is "exactly what was submitted" not the default behavior of ajax post?
[01:20:41] <pavonia> Not sure what the default format is
[01:21:49] <pavonia> Default is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"
[01:23:07] <alturic> I mean honestly, my only issue for not leaving it as is, is because it's coming back as json and &quot; is being converted to &amp;quot; so the browser isn't displaying the "
[01:25:43] <pavonia> alturic: What is your exact code on the client site? HTML entities and POST encoding shouldn't be related, AFAIK
[01:28:29] <alturic> pavonia: The main "issue" is this, my test sentence with the " and ' and <script> tags is being stored as all entities since that's what PHP is receiving to store in the DB, and whether that's right or not is moot for THIS point, I'm just looking to have single-quotes and double-quotes actually outputted as ' and " while not actually executing <script>stuff</script> and I'm having a hell of a time.
[01:29:04] <alturic> I can get behind the idea the PHP guys say of store exactly what the user input, but that I'm already not since I'm going wrong somewhere, somehow on the ajax post side since PHP is getting, and then storing in the DB, as entities.
[01:29:14] <alturic> But the end result is not having XSS. :P
[01:35:15] <snover> alturic: as pavonia said, show your code.
[01:37:47] <snover> also, if you think you only have to remove tags to prevent XSS, you are very mistaken.
[01:40:04] <alturic> snover: I mean, this is my jquery side: https://jsfiddle.net/h2Lbng18/ it's fired from a .click but that is literally all that is post'ing the data. my PHP is literally $var = $_POST['thequestion']
[01:41:50] <snover> the data sent to php will not be entity-encoded.
[01:43:14] <alturic> Ok, so if I was to echo $_POST['thequestion']; should I see the sentence exactly as I sent it or no? <- Not trying to be snarky, trying to start simple.
[01:43:25] <snover> try it and see?
[01:43:38] <alturic> Oh, I was more-so asking what I SHOULD see since they thing I'm double-encoding it.
[01:44:25] <alturic> Because I see entities.
[01:45:13] <snover> your url.php file is literally `<?php echo $_POST['thequestion'];` and you see html entities?
[01:45:19] <alturic> Yes sir.
[01:45:26] <alturic> Or ma'am. :p
[01:49:18] <snover> and how are you verifying this? are you looking at network activity in devtools?
[01:52:07] <snover> the DOM does not entity-encode form values, jQuery does not entity-encode ajax data, and PHP does not entity-encode EGPCS. so there is no way that what you are saying is true, unless you have a script on the client-side that is messing with $.ajax or XMLHttpRequest, or a script on the server-side that is messing with $_POST, that you have not mentioned.
[01:52:40] <snover> or a web server that is messing with the data before it gets to php.
[01:56:44] <snover> and, as it sounds like you were already advised about this, you should not be storing entity-encoded data in your database. encode it for output only when you are actually outputting html.
[04:08:10] <r0f0> hi, I am creating a web app in jquery mobile, and I am wondering if it is a good idea to allow users signup users from the responsive end.
[04:09:04] <r0f0> I am trying to implement captch for mobile and seems like it is not responsive unless you use some hacky way
[04:22:31] <cerion> hi. I am migrating from jquery 1.9- to 2.2.4 and using jquery migrate 1. but it does not warn me about $.browser.msie I use. Why ? I already see JQMIGRATE: Migrate is installed with logging active, version 1.4.1. how could I know it works and warn me of other depreceated features ?
[05:03:14] <Cork> cerion: $.browser was deprecated in jquery 1.7
[05:03:28] <Cork> (or might even have been 1.5)
[05:04:30] <Cork> ah, even worse it was deprecated in 1.3, removed in 1.9
[05:09:02] <Cork> cerion: also 1.9+ and 2.x is compatible those are identical except support for older ie browsers
[05:09:16] <Cork> -"is compatible"
[07:45:55] <cerion> Cork: ok. in fact I ugraded form 1.6
[07:46:13] <sinopia> Hello, im using JsBarcode (https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode) it generates barcodes with javascript, but it creates a dataURI raw png image, and I can't copy multiple images to Microsoft Excel. Anyone knows how I can save them like a temp folder and get the url decoded? (That way I can copy the images).
[07:46:32] <Cork> cerion: ah, you want the 1.x migration then
[07:47:57] <Cork> sinopia: you can puts the data uri into an a tag and do <a download href="data:">
[07:48:13] <Cork> when clicking it it should offer you to save it to a file
[07:48:32] <Cork> (if you can edit the code that is prob the simplest solution)
[07:48:54] <Cork> else you would have to copy the data and base64 decode it and save it to a file
[07:50:26] <sinopia> If I click with the rightmouse it alreadys shows me save as, but it's to create orders and print them in Microsoft Excel. I only can copy one-per-one as Bitmap and can't multiple as html.
[07:51:11] <Cork> sinopia: uh, are you sure you're asking in the correct channel?
[07:54:05] <sinopia> the barcodes are generated using jQuery. I've been searching but can't find a way that works.
[08:00:55] <Cork> it doesn't really matter if it is generated by a jquery plugin, it is just data uris after that
[08:07:50] <cerion> hu ho! jquery migrate 3 (migrating to 3 now here) throws migration warning for jquery ui... sight
[08:08:29] <Cork> cerion: if you grab the latest version of jquery it should work just fine
[08:08:47] <cerion> I laredy have
[08:08:52] <Cork> well doens't have to be the latest but one that is actually compatible with it
[08:09:05] <Cork> then you shouldn't get any warnings
[08:09:14] <Cork> make sure you don't include jquery ui twice
[08:09:53] <Cork> been using jquery ui with jquery 3.x for... close to a year
[08:11:44] <Akuw> i am getting this error   Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .bs-docs-container [href=#]
[08:12:05] <Cork> your selector is broken
[08:12:15] <Akuw> jquery.min.js:2
[08:12:21] <Cork> your selector is broken
[08:19:07] <Akuw> what means that?
[08:20:10] <cerion> Cork: I didn't say it didn't work. I said jq migrate throws warning about jq ui
[08:23:48] <Cork> cerion: ya, but it shouldn't unless your using an old version
[08:25:57] <Cork> cerion: what is the warning your getting from jquery ui?
[08:31:16] <cerion> Cork: I know. that's what I excepted too. I mean that jq ui behave with jq 3. Using jq ui 1.12.1 I got this warning: https://pastebin.com/HuxTxG7r
[08:31:45] <FilipNortic> Akuw: there's a syntax issue or a typo in your code
[08:32:11] <Cork> FilipNortic: no, the error is in the selector like i said
[08:32:27] <Cork> the error means the regex parser of the selector crashes
[08:32:56] <FilipNortic> yes i would call that a syntax issue
[08:33:07] <FilipNortic> or does it imply a jQuery bugg
[08:33:15] <Cork> no
[08:33:27] <Cork> but i generally don't count content in a string as syntax
[08:33:31] <Cork> but ya, get your point
[08:34:08] <FilipNortic> a broken selector sounds kind of mysterious if you are a begginer
[08:34:18] <FilipNortic> beginer*
[08:34:39] <Uhkis> or even a beginner!
[08:34:53] <Uhkis> but you still should've read the basics and know what a selector means
[08:35:49] <Cork> cerion: ah, i see now i don't use those plugins from ui
[08:36:40] <Cork> cerion: its from the focusable :data selector parts
[08:36:54] <Cork> *focusable plugin, and :data selector part
[08:37:24] <Cork> prob used to be compatible with 1.6 as it doesn't have the new versions
[08:37:49] <Cork> and it is just deprecation warnings so it will be bumped when they drop support for pre 3.x
[08:39:12] <Cork> Akuw: https://jsfiddle.net/z2eL1v83/ quote your argument values
[09:26:09] <balance> hi
[09:27:20] <balance> somehow $ doesnt seem to be defined in the console but e.g. (function($) { ... })(jQuery); works fine, the source is included but why isn't $ accessible?
[09:32:05] <gutts> has anyone worked with any sort of plugin/interface for cloning form elements / incrementing/resorting indexes?
[09:37:20] <FilipNortic> balance: jQuery in no conflict mode doesn't set $ it just sets jQuery

[10:40:44] <jphase> Anyone happen to know if there's an event that I can bind to that will fire when someone subscribes to push notifications?
[10:44:55] <FilipNortic> jphase: There are listeners for fom modifications but it's usally not the way to go
[10:48:43] <jphase> I see
[10:49:25] <jphase> so since I'm using a 3rd party for notifications, I'd probably be better off looking at their API docs then for some type of callback etc.
[10:49:31] <jphase> thx :)
[12:08:00] <randymarsh9> hello
[12:08:43] <randymarsh9> does jquery have a way to autofill previously entered values in an input field?
[12:11:39] <balance> FilipNortic, ah so its nonconflict mode ty Kartagis I think because of prototype or however it is called - u can get a conflcit with the $.
[12:11:41] <balance> thanks
[12:29:57] <taplar> yay, got webpack compiling vue finally, lol
[12:30:39] <robertmaxrees> ñiiiice
[12:30:57] <taplar> now to figure out how to make gulp trigger it, ;)
[12:31:15] <tarwater> why won't my slider orientation go vertical...
[12:31:27] <tarwater> i'm using this code exactly: https://jqueryui.com/slider/#slider-vertical
[12:31:33] <tarwater> it initializes fine
[12:31:58] <taplar> can you show us the faulty version?
[12:32:50] <tarwater> the code? or like a working codepen?
[12:33:02] <taplar> codepen or fiddle
[12:34:58] <tarwater> well shit, it's working fine in the jsfiddle
[12:35:15] <tarwater> it's the same code >:(
[12:35:24] <taplar> so now you get to look and see what is different between the fiddle and your site
[12:35:25] <robertmaxrees> are you including all the necessary css?
[12:37:38] <tarwater> no :(
[14:27:12] <ppp_> hi
[14:27:23] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[14:33:28] <tocka> evening! :)
[14:34:03] <tocka> im submitting data via ajax request, if the validation fails I return errors in json format with a 422 HTTP code
[14:34:10] <tocka> and success is not picking it up..
[14:34:10] <tocka> https://jsfiddle.net/f0xsk9zo/
[14:34:17] <tocka> how could I do this differently?
[14:35:25] <tarwater> what does the laravel error log say
[14:36:15] <tarwater> i've never used a POST that way. could you do GET?
[14:36:24] <robertmaxrees> try using .fail(function() { console.log('foo') }); tocka
[14:37:10] <tocka> robertmaxrees: but what exactly foo would be?
[14:38:05] <robertmaxrees> tocka well, let's back up and get meta for a second.  are you sure a 422 is the correct status code here?
[14:38:18] <tocka> yeah.. laravel was returning that by defualt
[14:38:22] <tocka> default*
[14:38:39] <robertmaxrees> Not what I asked ;)
[14:39:19] <robertmaxrees> .fail() in this case denotes that the request didn't do what you wanted it to.  are you trying to get info about which field is invalid?
[14:40:34] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/23779461/923919 tocka
[14:40:36] <tocka> im trying to get the
[14:40:39] <robertmaxrees> if you need the response body.
[14:40:43] <tocka> errors and then put them in a div
[14:40:55] <tocka> this seems to do the trick
[14:40:56] <tocka> https://jsfiddle.net/f0xsk9zo/1/
[14:41:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd use the native JSON.parse() instead but fair enough.
[14:41:23] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:41:30] <tocka> ;)
[14:41:31] <tocka> thanks
[15:40:35] <impliednude> I need to figure out a way to see if on a page a js created element is actually present.

[16:37:09] <qbert> Hey guys, just wanted to let you know about our latest coding contest https://alkanyx.com/forums where you can get a $40 bonus if you chose to sell your apps/scripts on our marketplace.
[16:38:25] <taplar> it's a help room qbert, not really a script writing room
[16:45:43] <robertmaxrees> taplar++
[17:07:26] <sigdk> I need help with refactoring. My code looks like this: https://jsfiddle.net/2bzc034b/5/
[17:07:51] <sigdk> How can I get rid of those variables on top?
[17:11:31] <taplar> where is the first one used?
[17:12:14] <taplar> should 'deviceEnduserURL' be 'userURL' ?
[17:13:15] <taplar> if so, that variable could be stored as a data field on the modal
[17:13:17] <robertmaxrees> also: mixing .done() with error: is funky.
[17:13:42] <sigdk> taplar, yes, it is 'userURL'... it's a typo. I tried to simplify/cut things
[17:13:55] <taplar> can you correct the fiddle plz
[17:14:42] <sigdk> https://jsfiddle.net/2bzc034b/6/
[17:15:15] <taplar> alright so first thing i'd suggest is the data field
[17:15:18] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, yeah, that's not clean but first I'd like to maintain the state properly
[17:15:32] <taplar> in your method when you compute the url, stick it on the modal with data('someKey', theValue)
[17:15:42] <taplar> that way it doesn't have to be global
[17:16:02] <sigdk> taplar, in fact there is a list of buttons. each one when clicked triggers the editUser with different deviceIdentifier
[17:16:21] <taplar> right, but they all go through that method to compute the url first, right?
[17:16:30] <sigdk> taplar, yes
[17:16:41] <taplar> so it changes the data field before it shows the modal, and you're good
[17:17:32] <sigdk> taplar, I can avoid the editUser function completely, right?
[17:17:40] <taplar> no, just the global variable
[17:20:16] <sigdk> taplar, I did a small update: https://jsfiddle.net/2bzc034b/7/
[17:20:40] <sigdk> so I also need the variables inside $("#userFormSubmit").on("click", function() { ... });
[17:21:00] <taplar> that's fine.  it will always be on the modal
[17:21:01] <sigdk> my problem is, how do I maintain state... if not with global variables
[17:21:45] <taplar> is userFormSubmit on the modal?  i'm not seeing it out right
[17:21:57] <taplar> ya, there it is
[17:22:07] <taplar> so yeah, one sec
[17:23:42] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2bzc034b/8/
[17:25:20] <taplar> comprende?
[17:26:41] <taplar> even without data fields, you can always use some form of an IIFE to scope them down.
[17:28:32] <sigdk> taplar, I was thinking some "module" version of it... but okay, at least I don't have the global variables
[17:29:21] <sigdk> what is this: $userModal? Just a variable that holds the modal object? Why did you put the $ in front?
[17:29:37] <phelix> http://jsbin.com/seyunasaso/edit?html,js,output I am having a hard time getting all those results into a single array. I am trying to get it setup so that IF data['cities'] they will go into the array and also if data['airports'] exist it will go into array too.
[17:29:50] <phelix> not sure how to create this properly.
[17:29:55] <phelix> array
[17:30:06] <taplar> first q = yes.  second q = putting $ on the front of a variable name is a syntax some people use to denote that the variable should contain a jquery object
[17:30:58] <taplar> $myVar lets me know in a long script, or as a parameter to a function, that i should expect a jquery object.  so no need to stick it in $() later
[17:31:28] <sigdk> taplar, ok. thanks
[17:31:38] <sigdk> how could I get rid of the function?
[17:31:44] <taplar> which one?
[17:31:56] <sigdk> the editUser
[17:33:00] <sigdk> taplar, have something like this: "data-toggle="modal" data-target="#userModal"  and somehow pass the deviceIdentifier to $userModal.on("shown.bs.modal", function() { if possible
[17:33:37] <taplar> i'm looking at putting the id on the element as a data field, and seeing if you can get it off of the event object, one sec
[17:35:05] <phelix> Anyone have an idea why my $.extend isn't merging these arrays properly?
[17:36:09] <taplar> sigdk: can you get the modal working in that fiddle?
[17:36:36] <taplar> without the onclick that is
[17:38:03] <taplar> phelix: can you make a working example of the issue?
[17:38:30] <sigdk> taplar, let me try fix it, at /8
[17:39:14] <phelix> taplar, well for this mappedCities and mappedAirports both return arrays. However only mappedAirports are displaying in mappedResults
[17:39:16] <phelix> if that helps.
[17:40:37] <phelix> the $.merge doesn't seem to be giving me a results with all items that exist.
[17:40:50] <taplar> i'd have to test it, but the api seems to suggest merge works with objects.  dunno if it works with arrays
[17:41:21] <phelix> Yes, they are all objects
[17:41:39] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat
[17:42:02] <taplar> the children are objects, but you said the top element is an array
[17:43:57] <phelix> taplar, http://jsbin.com/naxibirefi/1/edit?html,js,output
[17:44:23] <taplar> right, arrays of objects
[17:44:28] <taplar> just concat them
[17:44:29] <phelix> on the HTML side is the results. for mappedCities I am getting 4 objects and for mappedAirports I am getting 11 results but the mappedResults is only returning the mappedAirports
[17:45:49] <phelix> I thought that was what $.extend does
[17:46:12] <sigdk> taplar, for some reason... edituser appears to be out of scope https://jsfiddle.net/2bzc034b/9/  (there was also a missing parenthesis)
[17:46:40] <taplar> yeah because of the inline binding.  you can take off the inline binding
[17:46:48] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:46:53] <taplar> the data-target with bootstrap should auto open the modal
[17:47:46] <taplar> phelix: https://jsfiddle.net/jxk5tjtp/  <-- doesn't seem to work with arrays
[17:47:50] <taplar> just concat them
[17:48:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jxk5tjtp/1/
[17:48:50] <taplar> it's a native method that has existed forever.  no reason to use a library to do that for you
[17:50:43] <sigdk> taplar, I'm not sure I understand you... here: https://jsfiddle.net/2bzc034b/10/   the modal opens but no deviceIdentifier is passed (edituser is bypassed)
[17:51:12] <taplar> that's fine.  that's what i was after
[17:53:21] <phelix> taplar, never used concat before. Can you easily add a third array to the mix? by just adding another .concat(otherArray)
[17:53:28] <taplar> sigdk https://jsfiddle.net/2bzc034b/11/
[17:54:01] <taplar> phelix: i'll have to look at the doc, but you may just have to chain them.  though that fiddle i linked has some weirdness going on with how i was chaining them
[17:54:17] <phelix> yea
[17:54:36] <taplar> looks like you can give concat N number of arrays to concat
[17:55:38] <phelix> So say mappedPlaces doesn't exist though and it tries to add it.
[17:55:45] <phelix> not sure if I need to format how I have this differently.
[17:55:49] <taplar> phelix: https://jsfiddle.net/jxk5tjtp/2/
[17:55:53] <taplar> the extend was fubaring it
[17:56:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jxk5tjtp/3/
[17:57:04] <taplar> you can safeguard against null/undefined

[17:58:26] <sigdk> taplar, hmm, not bad...  and I can always store things like this: $userModal.data(key, value); and access it from anywhere, i.e $("#userFormSubmit").on("click", function() {... , right?
[18:00:42] <phelix> taplar, yea this seems to work. Except now I get some undefined items that show up in my list.
[18:00:47] <taplar> bak
[18:01:08] <taplar> sigdk: yep.  the data field will be there until the element is removed from the dom
[18:01:15] <taplar> phelix: which version has the undefined?
[18:01:41] <sigdk> taplar, till closing the modal, right?
[18:01:49] <taplar> nope, even after that
[18:02:04] <phelix> well only places exist and now airports and cities then there are 2 undefined in the list
[18:02:07] <taplar> it stays until the element it is attached to is destroyed, you change it, or you remove it
[18:02:48] <taplar> phelix: can you show me the example that does that?
[18:03:03] <taplar> the last fiddle i gave to you was handling for null/undefineds
[18:03:47] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/jxk5tjtp/4/
[18:03:50] <phelix> this is what I am using now
[18:04:17] <taplar> yeah, take a look at /3
[18:04:20] <phelix> and if one of those objects don't exist i am getting an undefined and then it will show the airports and then undefined again
[18:04:35] <phelix> ahh missed that one
[18:04:36] <phelix> ok
[18:04:48] <taplar> also, if these things are going to be arrays, don't initialize them as empty objects
[18:04:54] <taplar> initialize them as arrays, or not at all
[18:05:48] <sigdk> can I somehow reset $userModal.data(...);
[18:05:59] <taplar> you can set it to null to remove it
[18:06:02] <taplar> iirc
[18:06:37] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/jxk5tjtp/5/ still seems to show undefined items.
[18:07:29] <taplar> change your initialization to arrays instead of objects
[18:07:34] <taplar> see if that fixes it
[18:07:37] <phelix> k
[18:08:12] <phelix> there we go!
[18:08:15] <phelix> that was the ticket. thanks
[18:08:20] <taplar> :)
[18:10:46] <taplar> hmm, another smell
[18:11:01] <taplar> is there a reason you are extended the items with a label that you are getting off of the item?
[18:11:37] <taplar> value: item.label makes sorta sense, but label: item.label seems odd
[18:13:19] <taplar> and you could possibly concat the three things from the data into a single array and do your map over that, rather than having three map calls
[18:13:48] <taplar> you'd possibly have to do the || [] safeguard against the data fields, but it would defo be smaller
[18:14:09] <taplar> r/smaller/less redundant
[18:17:12] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jxk5tjtp/6/
[18:17:23] <taplar> really isn't a reason to use extend there
[18:20:02] <sigdk> taplar, thank you for the help
[18:20:09] <taplar> np
[19:16:12] <pl_> hmmm
[19:16:21] <pl_> revolution.extension.navigation.min.js?1561242…:7 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaults' of undefined
[19:16:24] <pl_> what does this mean
[19:19:20] <delizin> I have a select field on my page that when changed sends a request to the server and receives a JSON object back which lets it change the selected option on other fields based on the first selection. The problem is one of the fields that needs to be changed is dependent on the other and has it's options populated by JSON as well. I can't seem to get jquery to send layered AJAX requests. Better explained here: https://dpaste.de/PPqF
[19:21:19] <delizin> pl_: It looks like that whatever object it tried selecting prior to that line wasn't in the DOM so it returned undefined, then it threw an exception when it tried getting a property of a nonexistent object
[19:21:53] <pl_> hmmm
[20:06:17] <Darren_> is there a way with jquery to say if you hover over A to trigger the hover on B?
[20:52:33] <ryantheleach> I have a SO question with 50 bounty riding, about a canonical and authoritative way to extend a jquery mobile button. There's someone responding, but I suspect they are just bounty hunting and don't understand the framework. Someone with some experience in jquery mobile responding would be muchly appreciated. :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44448268/custom-jquery-mobile-button/
