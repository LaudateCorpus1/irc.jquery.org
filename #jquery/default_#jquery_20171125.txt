[06:22:50] <goppo> hi
[06:23:13] <goppo> with $.ajax() does the argument to the 'success' function always have a .meta attribute?
[06:23:59] <goppo> say, this function https://dpaste.de/xYTA
[06:24:10] <goppo> should result.meta always exist?
[06:26:31] <shoky_> goppo: no, that depends on the response from the server
[06:27:38] <goppo> shoky_, oh, is 'result' there meant to be the parsed JSON response?
[06:27:48] <shoky_> goppo: yep
[06:28:06] <goppo> shoky_, ah. makes sense now!
[06:28:06] <goppo> thanks
[08:52:26] <NachoNose> I have host a website on localhost because I'm not guaranteed to have internet where I have to use my system. Now on the server it all works as intended but on the localhost I get a bunch of jquery errors. Anyone knows a thing or two who can help me out?

[08:56:23] <shoky_> NachoNose: your js files on top are not being loaded properly, check your devtools network tab to see what the response is for e.g. the first jquery_v.1.10.2.js is
[09:00:24] <NachoNose> 0ms
[09:00:45] <NachoNose> Sorry, I just started out my studies and now my sister asks me this but I have almost 0 knowledge haha
[09:00:53] <NachoNose> But I really want to help her out, it's for her nonprofit
[09:01:41] <NachoNose> https://i.imgur.com/qbpJoiu.png
[09:02:00] <NachoNose> And I've been searching google for the past 2 days and haven't made any progress
[09:02:16] <shoky_> NachoNose: click jquery_v.1.10.2.js there, look at the response
[09:03:07] <NachoNose> 7 huge lines of code, just like in the file I have in the source code of the site
[09:03:24] <NachoNose> I redownloaded the file from jquery itself so it should be ok
[09:04:09] <shoky_> NachoNose: show it?
[09:04:51] <NachoNose> https://i.imgur.com/vTwLzDc.png
[09:04:56] <shoky_> btw you're running a webserver on localhost yeah? not loading directly from the filesystem i hope
[09:05:19] <NachoNose> What do you mean directlyfrom the fileserver
[09:05:44] <NachoNose> I have setup and XAMPP, all the code is in /opt/lampp/htdocs/*website*/js
[09:06:08] <NachoNose> https://hastebin.com/pugobeqocu.js
[09:06:54] <NachoNose> I'm not trying to be a leecher by the way, I just really want to help her out but don't know how anymore
[09:08:53] <shoky_> NachoNose: i have no idea. can you try the non-minified jquery instead, might give more info
[09:09:25] <NachoNose> Ok, I'll try that.. Thank you !
[09:09:50] <shoky_> NachoNose oh wait
[09:10:10] <shoky_> NachoNose: you have some weird characters in your jquery js file
[09:10:21] <shoky_> NachoNose: the file was corrupted somehow
[09:10:49] <shoky_> probably same for the other 2 js files on the top
[09:11:30] <NachoNose> So just redownload from the official source instead from the fileserver from the website dev
[09:11:34] <NachoNose> I'll give that a shot
[09:18:12] <NachoNose> I downloaded jquery-3.2.1.min.js and replaced the jquery_v1.10.2.js with it the errors in the console remain the same
[09:28:47] <NachoNose> Ok got it, thanks shoky_
[09:28:58] <NachoNose> I'm new here and don't know how to tag you :)
[09:29:08] <shoky_> you just did ;)
[10:51:45] <diverdude> hi, why is no image appearing here? https://jsfiddle.net/mhh1to4b/
[10:58:13] <Woet> diverdude: whats your jQuery question?
[10:59:46] <diverdude> Woet: Is there a way to also scale the image down using css (keeping aspect ratio)?
[11:00:21] <Woet> diverdude: are you banned from #css or just enjoy going off-topic?
[11:01:08] <diverdude> Woet: i am not banned from css
[11:01:16] <Woet> diverdude: then I suggest asking there
[11:01:17] <diverdude> Woet: you dont know css?
[11:01:33] <Woet> diverdude: or, if you want an instant response, use something called Google and read the documentation
[11:01:37] <Woet> diverdude: I highly recommend it
[11:02:17] <diverdude> Woet: thank you for your deep help. i highly appreciate it
[11:02:25] <Woet> diverdude: I help people help themselves
[11:02:29] <Woet> diverdude: if you want spoon feeding its $150/hour
[11:05:23] <diverdude> Woet: hehehehe right
[12:17:36] <bp14> I want to use jQuery within a nodeJS library (custom library).  How would i include / require jQuery so that the exported function(s) can use jQuery's ajax methods?
[16:59:12] <Guest17984> Oh aight haha, the whole system is fixed by the way :) Thanks a lot!
