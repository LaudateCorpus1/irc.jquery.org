[05:00:06] <DnzAtWrk> yello
[05:00:17] <DnzAtWrk> any way to apply a tooltip generically to all links on the site
[05:00:26] <DnzAtWrk> even newly created links
[05:00:44] <DnzAtWrk> without having to manually apply the tooltip every time
[05:03:50] <DnzAtWrk> well, would it hurt if I just said $(document).tooltip(); whenever I update my dom
[05:04:30] <DnzAtWrk> does jquery check for the existence of already created jquery elements
[05:04:47] <DnzAtWrk> objects
[14:12:05] <dopie> hey all need some help here https://jsfiddle.net/04fo3rkp/  im trying to check when the user enters in POBox but im doing something wrong
[14:36:49] <ButtDog> How can I get all the inputs for  forms that have a particular method something like $('form[action*="material/update"]')
[14:37:08] <ButtDog> I'd like to monitor them for charges.
