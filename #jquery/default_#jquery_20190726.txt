[04:58:58] <Guest94> HI
[04:59:23] <Guest94> I have a question about uppercase in data-xxx attributes
[04:59:50] <Guest94> this used to work but it doesn't since jquery 1.12.4 :
[05:00:43] <Guest94> <html>
[05:00:47] <Guest94> d="test1" data-collectionName="Why">test jquery</button>
[05:02:07] <Woet> Guest94: www.jsfiddle.net
[05:02:52] <Guest94> is there any way to make this work again: .data("collectionName")
[05:03:26] <Guest94> we are upgrading from 1.4.4 to 3.x and have a lot of .data("upperCase") usages
[05:05:52] <Woet> Guest94: then use something like sed to mass replacee eit
[05:05:53] <Woet> replace it *
[05:07:13] <Woet> Guest94: data-collection-name="Why" would work with .data("collectionName")
[05:08:01] <Guest94> hmm, that would make it easier to replace everything
[05:08:07] <Woet> Guest94: https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/elements.html#attr-data - "All attributes on HTML elements in HTML documents get ASCII-lowercased automatically"
[05:08:32] <Guest94> I know, but in 1.4.4 .data("collectionName") worked
[05:08:59] <Guest94> even if there was "collectionname" in dataset
[05:09:02] <Woet> that's possible
[05:09:11] <Woet> it was released 9 years ago
[05:09:23] <Guest94> jeah, we are doing upgrade just now :D
[05:09:30] <Woet> so no idea what happened in those 9 years
[05:12:01] <Guest94> I'm guessing beacuse of this doesn't work anymore: https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/153acc1338073f1047b906fff8c9d1b9522c33bf
[05:12:31] <Guest94> or sth like this
[05:16:33] <Guest94> Woet: ok, data-collection-Name="Why" does work. What is the diff between "collectionName" and "collection-Name"? I mean, I'm worried that if I use 'data-collection-Name' sth else on some other level will stop working/will behave differently
[05:16:49] <Woet> Guest94: internally, foo-bar-zoo is converted into fooBarZoo
[05:17:07] <Woet> Guest94: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.dataset
[05:17:52] <Woet> you don't have to worry about any of this though
[05:17:53] <Woet> just stick to the speec
[05:17:54] <Woet> just stick to the spec
[05:17:55] <Woet> use lowercase attriibutes
[05:18:38] <Guest94> I will from now on, but now  I need to update 3500 files :)
[05:18:59] <Woet> super easy with sed
[05:19:06] <Uhkis> and a simple regex fixes them all ;)
[05:19:45] <Guest94> yes, simple regex will fix data-upperCase
[05:20:10] <Guest94> but will regex find and fix usages for those data-upperCase 100% ?
[05:21:52] <Woet> you can just change the jQuery .data call to lower case instead
[05:30:22] <Guest94> ha, this is going to be a nightmare, I've just found out that there might also be dynamic creation of data- attributes
[05:32:55] <Uhkis> here's hoping your tests are on par
[05:33:28] <Guest94> :D
[05:34:33] <Uhkis> does that smiley means "what tests?" :D
[05:38:42] <Guest94> we used to have automatic frontend/UI tests (selenium) but not anymore
[05:54:27] <Guest94> thank you for help
[05:54:33] <Guest94> bye
[10:55:23] <Josh_2> Hey, can I ask about the validate plugin here?
[17:05:10] <AndresInSpace> Oi
[17:05:36] <AndresInSpace> Using any version of jQuery that is not 3.4 latest (IE all versions prior have vulnerabilties)
[17:05:49] <AndresInSpace> If someone is using 2.x jQuery does that violate GDPR
[17:05:57] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:06:30] <AndresInSpace> considering that an attack can be carried out using jqueyr vulnerabities to expose sensitive data
[17:07:55] <robertmaxrees> where are you reading about older jquery version violating GDPR?
[17:08:11] <AndresInSpace> I am not reading anywhere
[17:08:12] <AndresInSpace> I am asking
[17:08:15] <AndresInSpace> based on the fact that
[17:08:34] <AndresInSpace> there's exploits in 1.x/2.x for cross site sccripting attacks and the likes
[17:08:43] <robertmaxrees> GDPR is a bunch of privacy laws.  jquery runs client side, not server-side.  jquery can be exploited, but only if you're negligent within your backend as well.
[17:08:48] <AndresInSpace> which in turn means there's a possibility in sensitive data being exposed..
[17:09:20] <grapheti_> there is always a possibility with sensitive data being exposed
[17:09:25] <grapheti_> everything is hackable
[17:09:52] <robertmaxrees> i mean, just using an old version of jquery would not necessarily be a violation - running a vulnerable version AND having an incescure backend would i suppose
[17:10:01] <robertmaxrees> *insecure
[17:10:16] <AndresInSpace> my point being is that if jquery was entry point for a XSS that used someones cookie/session and then pulled personal data out from said DB, would that not mean that jquery was the attack vector and should have been PATCHED to avoid that
[17:10:25] <AndresInSpace> patched ie upgraded to 3.4x whatever is latest
[17:10:50] <robertmaxrees> that only matters if your backend also is vulnerable though.
[17:11:02] <robertmaxrees> like, jquery on its own isn't the issue there.
[17:11:22] <AndresInSpace> no.. you can hijack someones session and how the hell are we to know that the browser requesting a page is malware on your computer
[17:11:50] <robertmaxrees> you're not asking a question - you're looking for someone to confirm your belief.
[17:12:09] <robertmaxrees> i am well aware of this subject, so either listen to what we're trying to tell you or don't.
[17:12:31] <robertmaxrees> there are a variety of controls that you use in tandem to prevent these kinds of issues.
[17:12:36] <AndresInSpace> I'm asking and explaining my understanding of context of my question
[17:13:09] <AndresInSpace> more or less I got my answer
[17:13:37] <robertmaxrees> and i've restated the same thing multiple times :) a vulnerable version of jquery alone isn't cause for concern - the server must also have an attack surface that enables the vulnerable version of jquery to actually do anything back.
[17:13:38] <robertmaxrees> *bad
[17:15:29] <AndresInSpace> Would consider a cookie that is not http restricted that is the session identifier, as being in violation since JS can read it and XSS can use that session?
[17:16:28] <AndresInSpace> Just wondering
[17:16:33] <robertmaxrees> i mean, that's a gutsy move, but the server itself would need to be vulnerable to XSS in the first place.
[17:17:04] <robertmaxrees> (gutsy is in reference to not using an httponly encrypted cookie)
[17:17:36] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees: basically I'm trying to pressure a company into upgrading their code to work with 3.x jquery
[17:17:48] <robertmaxrees> i figured as much :)
[17:17:56] <robertmaxrees> are they a client of yours?
[17:17:58] <AndresInSpace> their code only works with jquery 1.x or 2.x and they serve their own copy of jQuery if they can't use our copy
[17:18:01] <AndresInSpace> no we are  client of theirs...
[17:18:06] <AndresInSpace> its VWO
[17:18:14] <AndresInSpace> https://vwo.com/
[17:18:35] <robertmaxrees> Do they accept user input on their site and serve that up to other customers?
[17:18:43] <AndresInSpace> it's AB testing
[17:18:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware of what it is :)
[17:19:05] <AndresInSpace> its not about their site its about my site
[17:19:05] <AndresInSpace> lol
[17:19:19] <robertmaxrees> right, so be realistic about what it is that you want.
[17:19:36] <robertmaxrees> have you asked them why they haven't upgraded to the latest version of jquery?
[17:19:42] <AndresInSpace> I want them their script to be compatible with 3.x jquery ,_,it's been 3 damn years since 3.x came out
[17:20:03] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees: yes I've sent an email and I got a canned response of 'were sorry blag blah blah"
[17:20:14] <robertmaxrees> what else did the response say?
[17:20:23] <AndresInSpace> With use_existing_jquery = true in the code, the code will depend on page's jquery and will not work in this case, due to conflicting functions. You can keep it to false and use VWO's jquery.
[17:20:28] <AndresInSpace> litearlly all they said
[17:20:48] <robertmaxrees> i doubt they said "were sorry blag blah blah"
[17:20:49] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:20:58] <AndresInSpace> ,_,
[17:20:58] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd push them for an actual response.
[17:21:02] <AndresInSpace> yes
[17:21:06] <AndresInSpace> thats why i am asking about the vulnerabilities
[17:21:13] <AndresInSpace> if its even an INKLING of being an attack vector
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> before trying to go nuclear with arguing about GDPR
[17:21:19] <AndresInSpace> their claim is then false
[17:21:22] <robertmaxrees> they are likely well aware of the risks.
[17:21:26] <robertmaxrees> what claim?
[17:21:38] <AndresInSpace> VWO complies with data privacy and security regulations such as the GDPR
[17:21:48] <AndresInSpace> With internationally-recognized certifications such as ISO 27001 and BS 10012
[17:21:52] <robertmaxrees> heh, they very likely do comply.
[17:22:17] <AndresInSpace> robertmaxrees: well duh. I'm just trying to push them into a 'maybe this will be a problem in the future if we don't upgrade things now'
[17:22:20] <robertmaxrees> one person raising a stink about an out of date library likely won't get you very far.
[17:22:24] <AndresInSpace> yeah
[17:22:33] <AndresInSpace> i know that's why im asking about this
[17:22:34] <AndresInSpace> lol
[17:22:37] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:22:37] <AndresInSpace> before I go on a tangent
[17:23:08] <AndresInSpace> anyways
[17:23:09] <robertmaxrees> they are likely aware of the concerns.  none of what you've presented tells me that they have any real attack surface to be concerned about here.
[17:23:12] <AndresInSpace> appreciate your time Robert
[17:26:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:31:55] <grapheti_> I think you just enjoy typing sometimes robertmaxrees
[17:31:59] <grapheti_> kek
[17:32:02] <robertmaxrees> top kek
[17:32:12] <robertmaxrees> it's almost like i have experience in these things
[17:33:07] <grapheti_> Seasoned people in the field know nothing. Get on board with my agenda or gtfo.
[17:33:14] <robertmaxrees> D:
[17:33:21] <robertmaxrees> OH WELL
[17:33:35] <grapheti_> lulZ
[20:43:43] <tona> hello everyone , why I am not able to scroll down , after to show my div., jQuery( "#main-content" ).show();
[20:43:54] <tona> any advice will be welcome
[20:44:36] <tona> it only work if I set Jquery animate but I dont have to put one animation , Just want to scroll down after to show my div
[20:45:16] <robertmaxrees> we'd have to see the actual issue.
[20:48:08] <robertmaxrees> tona ^
[20:50:05] <tona> https://jsfiddle.net/akth75yn/
[20:50:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:50:46] <robertmaxrees> i don't see the bug replicated there.
[20:51:30] <robertmaxrees> i don't even see an element with package-table_filter as its ID.
[20:53:06] <tona> yes you are right here my example,https://jsfiddle.net/3xfLm0d8/
[20:53:14] <tona> it dont scroll down,
[20:53:25] <robertmaxrees> i still don't see the bug...
[20:54:27] <tona> if you see the output never scroll down , I expect to see the scroll bar move
[20:54:39] <robertmaxrees> uh
[20:54:41] <robertmaxrees> there's no scroll bar.
[20:54:47] <robertmaxrees> and you're not including jquery
[20:56:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mhk17pvr/2/
[20:56:39] <robertmaxrees> i think you're trying to do something like this.
[20:57:15] <tona> yes exactly
[20:57:17] <tona> :)
[20:57:37] <tona> is the same include jQuery vs $
[20:57:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:59:12] <tona> i have seen in google some command or intructions start with Jquery("")  and other start only with $("") ,I just want to undertand the difference between them
[20:59:21] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery()
[20:59:33] <tona> yes
[20:59:40] <robertmaxrees> and they're generally the same thing.
[21:00:21] <tona> ok thanks
[21:01:20] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery/ -> "In the first formulation listed above, jQuery() — which can also be written as $() [...])
[21:01:24] <robertmaxrees> "
