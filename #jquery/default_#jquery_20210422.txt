[07:10:49] <braindead_> i try to hide a button (.sticky-button) when a section (.e-d-book) is in viewport. i am not able to get it done though. anybody has time to help me out with it?
[07:11:06] <braindead_> what i fiddled together is this: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/85TsVXFPWk/
[07:11:16] <braindead_> but i guess this is complete garbage
[07:12:19] <braindead_> if i use it like this, the console is showing: Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function
[08:52:47] <Cork> braindead_: you're going to have to make a jsfiddle with the needed dom elements for that code to run
[08:52:56] <Cork> that paste says nothing
[09:06:09] <undefined_bob> hey Cork are you alright?
[11:31:08] <braindead_> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/hyLd6cpm/
[11:31:58] <braindead_> what I try to achieve is, that the red bar should be hidden when the .e-d-book is in viewport. it should show, when its not in viewport anymore
[11:32:18] <braindead_> right now, it hides but is not coming back on
[11:41:06] <Cork> braindead_: https://jsfiddle.net/tgbLav60/2/
[11:42:49] <braindead_> fucking legend
[11:42:52] <braindead_> thank you cork
[11:50:58] <braindead_> is there a smart way to add something like 50px or so to the top? so that it hides a little bit sooner?
[11:51:22] <Cork> sure just modify the check in the event handler
[11:59:10] <braindead_> got it. thanks again!
[12:04:23] <braindead_> now, this is perfect. i dont need to change anything on it but since you are already helping me here .. another question. if i want to not just hide it but make a smooth transition (for example transition to bottom for fade out), would this be something that is way more complicated?
[12:05:26] <Cork> a little toggle takes a boolean so when the formula results in true it shows the element and false hides
[12:05:40] <Cork> you would just have to replace it with animation logicks
[12:05:45] <Cork> "just"
[12:05:57] <braindead_> ok, so not worth the trouble
