[00:07:22] <elsheepo> robertmaxrees, http://dpaste.com/265S58P
[00:07:24] <elsheepo> checkkkkk it
[00:07:26] <elsheepo> all done
[00:08:00] <elsheepo> you mentioned mixing jquery with vanilla js, how can I make this more... jquery-ish
[00:09:13] <robertmaxrees> user jquery's event handlers and dom manipulation.
[00:09:26] <robertmaxrees> so insteado fo form.addEventListener( you'd use $(form).on(
[00:09:26] <robertmaxrees> etfc
[00:10:06] <robertmaxrees> bbiab meal prep
[00:15:15] <elsheepo> hmmm $(form).on( does not work
[01:09:35] <jak2000> hi all
[01:09:45] <jak2000> what is the best way for calculate Log10?
[01:14:00] <jak2000> done
[01:14:06] <robertmaxrees> wut
[01:16:13] <jak2000> return Math.log(val) / Math.log(10);
[01:16:53] <robertmaxrees> 'k...
[01:27:55] <jak2000> robert. how to print directly to printer without any printer dialog or preview (i use chrome)
[01:28:12] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 - you don't.  2 - that's not really a jquery question :|
[01:29:09] <jak2000> its a javascript?
[01:29:21] <jak2000> i reading something and i can do
[01:29:54] <robertmaxrees> vbscript doesn't count ;)
[01:30:25] <jak2000> https://printjs.crabbly.com/
[01:30:46] <robertmaxrees> that's... not the same as your question.
[01:31:17] <jak2000> i generate a pdf and displayed.... on a Chome wtab... i want print ... direct to printer...
[01:31:36] <robertmaxrees> so i want you to carefully think about why you wouldn't be able to do that.
[01:32:02] <pavonia> Who wouldn't want their printer to start spitting out pages of random stuff while visiting a website!?
[01:32:11] <robertmaxrees> lol exactly.
[01:32:17] <jak2000> ye sunderstand
[01:32:45] <jak2000> but the user compare my system, with a Winexe Program, him say, see only 1 click... and print direct...
[01:32:56] <robertmaxrees> so again
[01:33:19] <robertmaxrees> 1 - you cannot print without a dialog from a webpage. 2 - still not asking anything related to jquery.
[01:33:40] * jak2000 join to vbscript channe
[01:33:50] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[01:34:05] <robertmaxrees> i give up dude
[01:35:29] <pavonia> Is VBScript on websites still a thing? I think IE had some support of that years ago
[01:35:53] <robertmaxrees> IE was the only browser that supported it.  and it only worked if you explicitly allowed it.
[01:36:20] <jak2000> :(
[01:36:37] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[01:37:35] <jak2000> other way? any java applet?
[01:37:44] <jak2000> and sorry for not jquery question.... sorry
[01:37:46] * robertmaxrees looks at channel topic
[01:38:54] <robertmaxrees> here's some pro advice - even IF you got this whole printing thing to work, the next issue is going to be that the printed version looks wrong.  and that's going to be an even bigger pain to fix.
[01:48:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:48:37] <robertmaxrees> glad to know we're so trusted in here ;)
[02:00:09] <jquery289> hi there
[02:00:32] <jquery289> no answer was received on how one could write a component library like vue/riot?
[02:00:45] <robertmaxrees> odd question for this channel.
[02:00:53] <jquery289> yet a hot one
[02:01:01] <robertmaxrees> and still O/T :)
[02:01:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in ##javascript.
[02:01:06] <jquery289> i need that one
[02:01:28] <jquery289> ##javascript is too busy circlejerking on vue
[02:01:39] <jquery289> or react
[02:01:52] <robertmaxrees> doesn'
[02:02:00] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't change the topic here
[02:02:27] <jquery289> here's the end goal example https://kbrsh.github.io/moon/doc/guide.html
[02:02:45] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell ya
[02:03:10] <jquery289> if it would be "howto" that'd be great
[02:03:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm sure ##javascript could point you towards resources for that :)
[02:04:16] <jquery289> as i said, they are too preoccupied with current frameworks or clueless
[02:04:35] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the topic of this channel :shrug:
[02:04:40] <robertmaxrees> i dunno how else to phrase that.
[02:05:25] <jquery289> well, that's the most relevant channel you can find, so
[02:05:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:05:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm just trying to get you the help you need faster.
[02:06:10] <robertmaxrees> this channel is for jquery.  your question has nothing to do with jquery.
[02:06:47] <jquery289> it has to do everything with jquery, because the goal is to write a lib with/in jquery
[02:06:53] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[02:07:36] <robertmaxrees> good luck then my dude.
[02:07:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:07:44] <jquery289> #notananswer
[02:07:52] <robertmaxrees> take it elsewhere :)
[02:08:55] <Cork> interesting... is it so hard to understand what topic means...
[02:09:11] <robertmaxrees> apparently?
[02:09:36] <robertmaxrees> oh wait i mean
[02:09:38] <robertmaxrees> #notananswer
[02:09:40] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[02:09:42] <Cork> lol
[02:10:26] <robertmaxrees> :B
[02:11:00] <jquery289> since you are incapable of answering the question, it would be nice if someone else can do that
[02:11:38] <jquery289> could*
[02:11:39] <Cork> jquery289: go to a channel where the question is ontopic and you might actaully get that
[02:11:58] <Cork> continue on the path your on and your only likely to get your self kicked/baned
[02:12:06] <robertmaxrees> nah he's already earned it
[02:14:58] <robertmaxrees> oh wait that's still #notananswer
[02:15:34] <Cork> i bet hes sitting somewhere and fuming right now
[02:15:46] <robertmaxrees> working on a tweet.
[02:15:56] <Cork> definitely
[02:16:10] <robertmaxrees> i liked the entry - "I ASKED A QUESTION AND YET NOBODY ANSWERED ME."
[02:16:42] <Cork> ya i did them a service and asked them a question they could research for me, and they just kicked me out
[02:16:53] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[02:17:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm impressed i haven't gotten a pm yet.
[02:17:14] <Cork> lol
[02:17:41] <Cork> ppl tend to be reserved about nagging ppl with channel ops for some reason
[02:17:57] <Cork> like they think channel ops means you have a hook on the network or something
[02:18:01] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[02:18:28] <robertmaxrees> i've had a 50/50 rate with that.  lots of people hit me with "that kick/ban wasn't warranted"
[02:18:49] <Cork> wow i don't actually think i've ever gotten that...
[02:19:01] <robertmaxrees> lucky.
[02:19:07] <Cork> ya, apparently
[02:19:14] <robertmaxrees> there's one dude i banned a while back who still messages me every few weeks.
[02:19:30] <Cork> heh elephant...
[02:19:46] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[02:19:57] * Cork sees dumbo sitting at a keyboard picking with the trunk
[02:20:03] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[02:20:04] <Cork> ya, they say "memory as an elephant"
[02:20:28] <robertmaxrees> dude's obsessed with me.  keeps wanting me to "forgive" him.
[02:20:32] <robertmaxrees> it's weird.
[02:20:43] <Cork> O_o
[02:20:48] <Cork> is the ban still active??
[02:20:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  netted themselves a yearlong.
[02:21:20] <Cork> ah, ya those i've gotten "i'm sorry i didn't mean it" :/
[02:21:35] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: then ya shouldn't have done it imo.
[02:21:42] <Cork> exactly
[02:22:01] <robertmaxrees> it's not like you pop into the channel, say "hello", and get banned.
[02:22:17] <Cork> actaully like 17 years ago i did :D
[02:22:22] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[02:22:23] <robertmaxrees> tho that would be lols
[02:22:27] <Cork> that channel was a bit weird though
[02:22:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[02:22:43] <robertmaxrees> still is sometimes.
[02:22:45] <Cork> got me banned for about a week
[02:23:06] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha well alright.
[02:23:08] <Cork> i joined a channel saw the channel owner pop a "now playing" message
[02:23:15] <Cork> then another one did the same thing
[02:23:22] <Cork> where he prompty banned him
[02:23:29] <Cork> and i protested green as i was
[02:23:37] <Cork> and got a "this is not a democracy"
[02:23:38] <Cork> ;D
[02:23:42] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[02:24:04] <robertmaxrees> daaaaaaaaaang
[02:24:27] <Cork> we became good friends about a month later so no hard feelings ^^
[02:25:00] <robertmaxrees> ah the old days of irc.
[02:25:18] <Cork> this was over at irchighway, they are a bit loos on the ban cannon there
[02:25:42] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty much everywhere that isn't freenode imo
[02:25:47] <Cork> ya
[02:25:54] <Cork> or a company run irc server
[02:26:07] <robertmaxrees> ya
[02:26:19] <Cork> though those you have to hunt for now days
[02:26:38] <robertmaxrees> not super common at all.  iirc mozilla has their own tho.
[02:26:50] <Cork> ya, but they are shutting it down
[02:26:55] <robertmaxrees> oh really?
[02:27:02] <Cork> yup "not good enough"
[02:27:31] <Cork> http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2019/04/26/synchronous-text/
[02:27:34] <robertmaxrees> are you in ##javascript btw?
[02:27:38] <Cork> ya
[02:27:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm rolling
[02:28:01] <Cork> :)
[02:28:22] <Cork> funny how he picks a nick starting with the name of the channel...
[02:29:12] <robertmaxrees> the attitude is just amazing.
[02:29:35] <robertmaxrees> "No out of scope answers"
[02:29:43] <Cork> ya...
[02:30:16] <Cork> it is really that weird servitud atitude that some have, and i for the life of me can't understand where ppl can get that from...
[02:30:32] <robertmaxrees> dunning-kruger effect.
[02:32:23] <Cork> huh, that was a new one for me
[02:32:26] * Cork bookmarks
[02:32:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:33:44] <Cork> O_o hat es6 eith passion??
[02:33:48] <Cork> *hate
[02:34:02] <Cork> i so suspect he is cutting things a lot there...
[02:34:07] <robertmaxrees> also: "the dev team"
[02:34:13] <robertmaxrees> ie not him.
[02:34:18] <Cork> es6 is nice, but in some projects you don't want to have the compilation phase
[02:34:22] <Cork> ua
[02:34:31] <Cork> man by butter fingers...
[02:34:35] <Cork> *ya
[02:34:44] <robertmaxrees> i mean, sure?  but it's so, so trivial to setup babel.
[02:35:41] <Cork> sure, but for example here we have two projects where a strong requirements is that the source file easily can be mapped (without a .map file) to the source file
[02:35:59] <Cork> we have several projects that do, and where that works fine
[02:36:13] <Cork> but i can't understand why anyone would have a problem with es6
[02:36:18] <robertmaxrees> oh, sure.  but those projects aren't full ui component libraries.
[02:36:24] <Cork> no noooo
[02:36:25] <Cork> :)
[02:37:41] <Cork> and also the question is honnestly how many months compiling es6 to es5 will even be needed
[02:43:53] <robertmaxrees> you gonna be up for a while?
[02:44:04] <robertmaxrees> getting the feeling they're going to try to come back.
[02:47:57] <Cork> i'm at work so ya
[02:48:17] <Cork> at least for another few hours
[02:48:24] <robertmaxrees> okay rad - i'll leave the banlist alone then hahahaha
[02:48:43] <Cork> can't do anything about that anyway
[02:48:46] <Cork> :)
[02:48:58] <robertmaxrees> aren't you a mod?
[02:49:01] <Cork> nope
[02:49:04] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[02:49:11] <robertmaxrees> well then\
[02:49:38] <Cork> whould have been nice as i seam to be one of few that are regularly here from eu
[02:49:48] <Cork> but ya... didn't see the need when the offer was around
[02:50:35] <undefined_bob> good morning
[02:50:58] <Cork> o/
[02:52:47] <Cork> man i'm getting an earge to quote javascript for bash...
[02:53:19] <robertmaxrees> doooooo iiiiiiit
[02:53:56] <Cork> quote of the day "<buu> javascript693: I'm using the bathroom if you're still annoying when I get back I'm going to ban you
[02:53:56] <Cork> <javascript693> that won't be counted as an answer"
[02:54:14] <robertmaxrees> rofl
[02:54:28] <undefined_bob> lol
[02:54:46] <robertmaxrees> and with that - 7 day ban juuust in case.  it's already way past my bedtime.  gonna go grab my last dram and head to sleep.
[02:55:10] <robertmaxrees> and with that - enjoy, folks.
[14:43:03] <devslash2> I have this html tag: <video width="850" height="500" controls>
[14:43:03] <devslash2> <source id="ESDVideo" src="\ESDTraining\video.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.
[14:43:03] <devslash2> </video> In a jquery event I want to start playing the video
[14:43:09] <devslash2> is this possible ? if so how do I do that
[14:43:26] <taplar> I believe the native method is play(), yes?
[14:43:32] <devslash2> how ?
[14:43:40] <devslash2> ive tried lots of ways and nothing works
[14:43:50] <taplar> do you know how to do it in native js?
[14:44:00] <devslash2> the dev console says that play is not a function
[14:44:14] <taplar> play is a method for the <source>
[14:44:15] <devslash2> like this ? document.getElementById(theVideo).play();
[14:44:26] <taplar> yeah, that's what it's looking like
[14:44:40] <taplar> document.getElementById('ESDVideo').play()
[14:44:44] <taplar> would be the native way
[14:44:48] <devslash2> doesnt work
[14:44:54] <devslash2> no such method play()
[14:45:12] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[14:45:22] <devslash2> no
[14:45:28] <devslash2> ive given you the code above
[14:45:41] <taplar> it would help more if you could make a fiddle showing the issue
[14:46:05] <devslash2> i cant do that without uploading the video to some site and i cant do that
[14:46:41] <taplar> wait hold on, that's the source, not the video
[14:46:55] <taplar> try targeting the video instead
[14:47:10] <devslash2> how
[14:47:37] <taplar> give it an id or a class or something.  Or $('#ESDVideo').closest('video')[0].play()
[14:48:08] <devslash2> ok that worked thanks
[18:38:23] <caliel> good morning #jquery (ugt)
[18:38:32] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon :)
[18:38:38] <robertmaxrees> (fst) ;)
[18:38:56] * taplar grumbles about kids and their slang
[18:39:34] <robertmaxrees> (ugt/fst are similar - it's morning when you first connect and night when you disconnect)
[18:40:08] <caliel> french summer time ? Oo
[18:40:14] <robertmaxrees> freenode standard time
[18:40:21] <caliel> oh!
[18:40:30] <robertmaxrees> ;) same basic idea as ugt
[18:40:32] <caliel> nice to know :)
[18:40:59] <caliel> robertmaxrees: well, my irssi tells me it's 00:40, how can I find the fst?
[18:41:09] <robertmaxrees> ^ i just explained it.
[18:41:20] <robertmaxrees> it's morning when you connect and night when you disconnect.
[18:41:27] <taplar> lol
[18:41:36] <caliel> that's ugt Oo
[18:41:47] <robertmaxrees> i've heard it referred to as FST as well.
[18:41:49] <taplar> sooooooo, caliel.  got a jQuery question?
[18:41:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:41:55] <caliel> auhauhauha
[18:42:32] <caliel> taplar: no, just searching some good jquery filemanagers online, trying elFinder...
[18:42:49] <caliel> need for a symfony project..
