[03:02:21] <php> Hey there
[03:02:22] <php> $("#input-search").val($("#input-search").val() + String.fromCharCode(e.keyCode));
[03:02:34] <php> This code for some reason makes the first letter(s) capitalised.

[05:47:31] <Yepp> I have some ajax function that uploads the file to the server, I would like to execute another function after the upload but not on the success cause the server will also transfer the file to a cloud service. Where should I put the function?
[05:48:28] <Yepp>  my paste http://www.hastebin.com/iducutiwan.coffee
[05:48:36] <Yepp> After uploading I would like to make a notification that the image is being transferred to the cloud and not close the page
[06:23:13] <dvzxcvzxcv> hi
[07:38:50] <elisa87> hey what's the method for hover off?     $(".navbar-collapse li").hover(function(){$(this).css('background-color', 'red')})  like after I am done with hovering I want the color to get back to its normal
[07:43:50] <decx> hover has 2 callbacks
[07:44:00] <decx> but just use css
[07:44:04] <decx> makes no sense to use javascript
[08:01:50] <d0nk3y> Hey ho!
[08:06:02] <d0nk3y> Im pretty sure firefox-dev has something similar to android's all events class to list all posible events but i cant find it ....
[08:10:32] <d0nk3y> how can i list all or current events?
[08:17:35] <decx> it's right the to the element in the inspector
[08:17:48] <decx> right next
[08:41:44] <`slikts> how do I check if an element is included in a jquery set?
[08:42:00] <`slikts> .has?
[08:42:31] <decx> filter for elements in the root of the collection of find  for a deep search
[08:42:38] <decx> or find*
[08:43:58] <`slikts> that's slightly unfortunate but okay
[08:44:29] <decx> well has is just filter in a dress
[08:44:39] <`slikts> it doesn't seem to work anyway
[08:45:06] <`slikts> x = $('ul'); x.has(x[0]) // -> []
[08:45:23] <`slikts> even though there are uls there
[08:46:40] <decx> why would you look if x has x[0]
[08:46:44] <decx> that makes no sense
[08:46:54] <`slikts> just testing if it works
[08:47:12] <`slikts> x is a collection and I'm testing if it includes x[0]
[08:47:16] <`slikts> since I know it does
[08:48:14] <decx> well apparently has sets context so it's just find().length
[08:48:22] <decx> so go to filter
[08:48:40] <decx> $('ul').filter('.yep').length
[08:48:51] <evhTap> Hey
[08:48:52] <`slikts> except I don't need to filter by selector
[08:49:04] <decx> doesnt matter what you filter by fam
[08:49:12] <evhTap> Hey
[08:53:02] <d0nk3y> how can i get list of all/current eventhandlers?
[08:53:59] <`slikts> $els = $els.filter(function() { return !$inView.filter(this).length; }); // yay jquery
[08:54:26] <`slikts> you'd think that there would be methods for intersect/complement
[08:55:03] <decx> that's what filter is
[08:55:35] <`slikts> no, that's what filter can be used to implement
[08:55:54] <decx> how much native js do you write?
[08:56:00] <decx> the real filter is ubiquitous
[08:56:12] <`slikts> not sure what you're trying to say
[08:56:17] <decx> just that filter is great
[08:56:21] <decx> in either form
[08:56:48] <`slikts> I have nothing against filters, but I'd like to have higher level methods for sets
[08:57:12] <`slikts> jquery apparently doesn't even have Array#includes()
[08:57:19] <`slikts> not sure what the problem with .has() was
[08:57:29] <`slikts> docs said it accepts dom els
[08:57:55] <decx> yeah but it also sets a context
[08:57:57] <decx> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=has
[08:58:25] <decx> i feel like a good filter is easier to read than some sugar method masking it
[08:59:19] <`slikts> of course it's not easier to read than .intersect() .union() or .subtract()
[08:59:49] <`slikts> and it's just stupid that jquery is a collection lib and doesn't have these collection methods
[09:00:27] <decx> it has filter slice and add
[09:00:37] <`slikts> wew
[09:00:46] <decx> not to mention extend
[09:02:28] <`slikts> I guess the problem was my expectations
[09:03:48] <`slikts> expecting jquery to be less shit
[09:05:23] <decx> so this is for a selector for elements that are inside the active viewportl
[09:06:03] <`slikts> yes, why?
[09:06:13] <decx> how do you keep state?
[09:06:25] <decx> are you checking the dom on scroll?
[09:07:09] <`slikts> function isInView(el) { return el.getBoundingClientRect().top <= window.pageYOffset + window.innerHeight; }
[09:07:24] <`slikts> var $inView = $els.filter(function() { return isInView(this); });
[09:07:27] <decx> be aware that this gets expensive
[09:07:55] <decx> might be better off caching element offsets and dimensions on load/resize
[09:08:14] <decx> doing your math there and just setting newly active or disabled elements
[09:08:52] <decx> wrote a little experiment few months ago with a scrollcheck for 6000 elements with no domlookups apart from load
[09:09:00] <decx> where is it
[09:09:08] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/z95roz0r/2/
[09:09:29] <`slikts> it's a small enough thing that it doesn't matter
[09:09:31] <decx> it's not cleaned up but it gives you an alternative idea
[09:09:36] <decx> right
[09:10:07] <`slikts> also I *love* how I'm unable to do $els.filter(isInView) in jquery
[09:10:39] <`slikts> ah, I need to use `this` instead of a function param
[09:11:19] <decx> right it gets called with something like .call(el[i], args)
[11:44:20] <Yepp> if I call the modal the javascript way, I can't make my function work but doing it data-attributes it works. More clear explanation here http://www.hastebin.com/lofacoyuwe.coffee
[14:55:33] <Hans-Martin> hi folks, I'm trying to set up a page using jQuery mobile (1.4.5) containing a tabbed widget with three tabs and a navbar within a fixed header to select those tabs. This works very nicely, but when I open a div with data-role="dialog", the active tab button loses its selection marking (becomes gray instead of blue) and does not regain it when the dialog is closed (using any of several methods) the previously active tab is not shown as active
[14:55:33] <Hans-Martin> again. I've experimented with "ui-state-persist" but I'm not sure how that would need to be used in this situation, and when I set it as the class for all navbar buttons, all of them are shown als blue...
[14:56:04] <Hans-Martin> If need be, I can set up a jsfiddle, but that would take some time...
[14:58:14] <Hans-Martin> Oh I just found a stackoverflow Q&A which seems to cover this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16517837/jquery-mobile-not-persisting-button-state-during-navigation). Looks like quite some work is needed :-(
[15:54:53] <Hans-Martin> Hm, this is driving me crazy - tried to make a collapsible listview item, formatting is messed up (additional margin around it, although I did it exactly like in the demos). The I tried to play with the demo for collapsible listview items at jsfiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/czudshc5/), but it does not process the jquery mobile js/css at all :-(
[16:00:21] <Hans-Martin> ok, now it works in the fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/czudshc5/1/) - and it shows exactly the same effect (margins around stuff) as in my page...
[16:01:45] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/czudshc5/3/ i reordered "external resources"
[16:03:17] <Hans-Martin> argh, did't read the "adding some custom CSS to collapse borders and padding" part. That's probably the reason. Thanks for the reordering, that is indeed required! Now I need to fix the CSS...
[16:05:33] <Hans-Martin> So with the CSS it works: https://jsfiddle.net/czudshc5/4/
[16:05:38] <sillyslux> .ui-listview > .ui-li-static { padding: .7em 1em; } i guess you'd have to override that if you don't like it
[16:06:31] <sillyslux> now your initial question was..
[16:13:00] <Hans-Martin> well this question was about how to get collapsible list view items to work like the example. That one is answered now, but I see that it does not really solve my initial problem (opening an input form in a least intrusive way). That problem is still blurry, I think there are various possible approaches, and which one is best depends on personal taste and opinion. So I'll try the next optioen :-)
[16:37:11] <molkemon> da
[17:00:22] <FoxRocks> hello
[17:00:30] <FoxRocks> first time to this channel!
[17:01:01] <FoxRocks> I am having a bit of difficulty getting my code to work, I was hoping someone could help me
[17:03:16] <FoxRocks> http://laravel.io/bin/aNK0q
[17:03:24] <FoxRocks> I have a div with id="create_login_group" that is normally hidden. I want to reveal it once a checkbox (id="create_login_button) is triggered
[17:03:24] <FoxRocks> then toggle it closed again, depending on the checkbox state
[17:20:57] <sillyslux> try .toggle( "slow" )
[17:21:33] <sillyslux> .toggle('slide', 400) <- there is no 'slide'
[17:22:18] <sillyslux> if you don't like the default animation you can use .animate()
[17:22:54] <FoxRocks> Oh! ok, I was looking at this: http://jqueryui.com/toggle/
[17:22:58] <FoxRocks> that could be the problem
[17:24:49] <FoxRocks> no luck I'm afraid
[17:25:00] <FoxRocks> I've started a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/1/
[17:36:59] <FoxRocks> sorry, got kicked offline
[17:39:12] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/3/
[17:40:23] <FoxRocks> Hi sillyslux
[17:40:32] <FoxRocks> thanks very much, that's brilliant!
[17:40:41] <sillyslux> yw
[17:42:21] <FoxRocks> strange, it doesn't work on my app
[17:42:47] <FoxRocks> should this script be placed at the beginning or the end of the page?
[17:47:18] <sillyslux> $("#create-login-group") should be evaluated when there the according element exists
[17:48:29] <sillyslux> if it's there in index.html then end of page should be ok
[17:48:59] <FoxRocks> I have a question about the different jQuery releases. If there was some function that uses, let's say version 1.10.4and then I have another function that uses say version 1.11.4, do I have to load both, or would the newest one cover the older ones?
[17:49:08] <FoxRocks> oh, ok, that makes sense.
[17:49:11] <sillyslux> if it's created later on, the eventListener for click has to be attached after creation
[17:50:00] <sillyslux> you can put the code in head and do $(document).ready(function(){/yourcode/})
[17:50:07] <sillyslux> there are many ways
[17:50:11] <FoxRocks> that makes sense. I think I'll just keep my scripts at the end to be safe
[17:51:26] <sillyslux> honestly, i don't know much about jquery, i'd keep the latest version and debug
[17:52:16] <FoxRocks> I figured it would be logical to have the latest version cover all previous functions
[17:52:52] <FoxRocks> So, this updated jsfiddle is working great, but it doesn't work in my application. Nothing is showing in the console for errors, I'm just not sure what's up
[17:55:08] <FoxRocks> Also, as you can see from my fiddle, I have a part of the form being toggled, depending on the checkbox. Is there an easy way to clear that section of the form when it's toggled to hide?
[17:55:42] <sillyslux> try $https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/4/ then use the js-console to check for $("#create_login_button") while execution is halted
[17:56:34] <sillyslux> what do you mean by "clear it of the form"?
[17:59:30] <FoxRocks> I was thinking it would be great if I could clear the fields that are hidden by the checkbox. So, when a user clicks the checkbox it reveals two additional fields to complete. What I want is for those fields to be cleared if the user deselects the checkbox. If that makes sense?
[18:02:02] <FoxRocks> Ok, so when I load the page that debugger shows up. I selected the "continue" button on the debugger, while monitoring the console, until the debugger gets past that script. Nothing ever shows up in the console
[18:05:43] <sillyslux> well clearing is easy if you use <form> https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/5/
[18:07:02] <sillyslux> before clicking "continue" you can use the js-console to examine the current state
[18:07:05] <FoxRocks> hmm, no, this is only two fields of the whole form. It's not a big thing for me, it was just a thought. I'll just do a check on the checkbox and ignore those fields if it's not checked.
[18:07:16] <FoxRocks> ok
[18:07:28] <FoxRocks> where does it show the current state?
[18:07:59] <sillyslux> in jsfiddle, you have to switch window context, though...
[18:08:31] <FoxRocks> I was running this on my app, using the browser of course
[18:08:31] <FoxRocks> :)
[18:08:57] <sillyslux> in the console there's a dropdown box which should be "top" (or maybe one of the chrome extensions)
[18:09:22] <sillyslux> switch that to "result (fiddle.jshell.net/")
[18:09:56] <sillyslux> or leave it on "top" if you're on your site
[18:10:35] <sillyslux> while it's paused, write $("#create_login_button") in the console and press eter
[18:11:08] <sillyslux> s/eter/enter
[18:12:30] <FoxRocks> oh ok, cool
[18:12:40] <FoxRocks> so that did return something in the console...
[18:13:06] <FoxRocks> .fn.init {context: document, selector: "#create_login_button"}
[18:13:06] <FoxRocks> context
[18:13:06] <FoxRocks> :
[18:13:06] <FoxRocks> document
[18:13:06] <FoxRocks> selector
[18:13:06] <FoxRocks> :
[18:13:06] <FoxRocks> "#create_login_button"
[18:13:07] <FoxRocks> __proto__
[18:13:07] <FoxRocks> :
[18:13:08] <FoxRocks> Object[0]
[18:13:09] <FoxRocks> oops
[18:13:13] <FoxRocks> sorry
[18:14:13] <sillyslux> so there's no such element with id create_login_button at that moment
[18:14:21] <sillyslux> in script execution
[18:14:31] <FoxRocks> that's right, I corrected that mistake just now and re ran the $("#create_login_button")
[18:14:40] <FoxRocks> I got the input back as a result
[18:14:45] <FoxRocks> <input>
[18:15:34] <sillyslux> you had id="create-login-group" and #create_login_group there
[18:15:35] <FoxRocks> <input id="create-login-button" data-toggle="toggle" data-on="Yes" data-off="No" data-onstyle="primary" data-size="small" name="user_login" type="checkbox">
[18:15:50] <sillyslux> i changed that in the fiddle
[18:16:16] <FoxRocks> cool
[18:16:41] <sillyslux> better now?
[18:16:50] <FoxRocks> so I get that input back, does that mean it's finding my checkbox?
[18:16:56] <FoxRocks> no, it's still not working
[18:17:17] <sillyslux> then look for $("#create_login_group")
[18:17:30] <sillyslux> put debugger inside the click funtion
[18:18:27] <FoxRocks> I did this: https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/6/
[18:18:34] <FoxRocks> but no debugger opens
[18:18:38] <FoxRocks> is it in the right spot?
[18:19:17] <FoxRocks> btw, thanks so much for your time, I really appreciate the help
[18:19:18] <sillyslux> yes, now it should halt after click
[18:19:56] <FoxRocks> hmm, it doesn't
[18:20:01] <FoxRocks> that's a clue
[18:20:16] <FoxRocks> I use to use the classic "alert" for troubleshooting JS
[18:21:10] <sillyslux> that's the id="create-login-group" vs. #create_login_group again
[18:21:30] <sillyslux> wait no
[18:21:42] <FoxRocks> I think I've fixed that?
[18:22:17] <FoxRocks> <input id="create-login-button" data-toggle="toggle" data-on="Yes" data-off="No" data-onstyle="primary" data-size="small" name="user_login" type="checkbox">
[18:23:17] <sillyslux> id="create-login-button"
[18:24:10] <sillyslux> $("#create-login-button") but id="create_login_button" in the fiddle
[18:24:54] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/8/ there now it halts on click
[18:24:54] <FoxRocks> oh, I may have fixed that in my app but not the fiddle
[18:25:01] <FoxRocks> https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/7/
[18:26:56] <sillyslux> now what's missing?
[18:27:44] <FoxRocks> ok, I've double checked my naming and it's all good. However, when I run that script it doesn't do anything when I click the button
[18:28:06] <FoxRocks> I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I'm using the Laravel framework and the Bootstrap css
[18:28:20] <sillyslux> while you're already there.. see the "call stack" and "scope" panes in developer tools?
[18:28:31] <FoxRocks> yes
[18:28:42] <sillyslux> well they're interesting
[18:28:47] <sillyslux> play :)
[18:29:06] <FoxRocks> haha :)
[18:29:10] <FoxRocks> They're empty right now
[18:29:24] <sillyslux> call stack tells you how the halted function was called (where from)
[18:29:28] <FoxRocks> dang, this is strange...
[18:29:35] <FoxRocks> oh cool
[18:29:37] <sillyslux> you can get to the according line in code by click
[18:30:03] <sillyslux> scope show's you "this" and variables in current scope
[18:30:05] <FoxRocks> very cool
[18:30:28] <FoxRocks> dude, you're being a huge help
[18:30:38] <sillyslux> :)
[18:30:46] <sillyslux> makes me happy too
[18:31:04] <sillyslux> so, did it halt on click?
[18:31:10] <FoxRocks> it's gotta be something conflicting, no? I mean, why would it work in Fiddle and not in my app
[18:31:14] <FoxRocks> no :(
[18:31:35] <FoxRocks> I wonder if my version of jquery is wrong
[18:31:57] <sillyslux> then back to the line before $("#create-login-button").click( add a 2nd debugger
[18:32:19] <sillyslux> obviously the click event got lost
[18:33:08] <sillyslux> you can also right click the checkbox itself and look at it's eventListeners
[18:33:30] <sillyslux> and see if the one in question is indeed there
[18:34:40] <FoxRocks> I right clicked...then inspect?
[18:39:13] <FoxRocks> ok, I found it. So it does list two event listeners on that checkbox...I started clicking on the drop down arrows and got pretty lost
[18:39:45] <sillyslux> oh now i was kicked
[18:40:09] <sillyslux> what was the last i said?
[18:40:37] <FoxRocks> sillyslux
[18:40:37] <FoxRocks> you can also right click the checkbox itself and look at it's eventListeners
[18:40:37] <FoxRocks> and see if the one in question is indeed there
[18:40:49] <FoxRocks> FoxRocks
[18:40:49] <FoxRocks> ok, I found it. So it does list two event listeners on that checkbox...I started clicking on the drop down arrows and got pretty lost
[18:40:55] <sillyslux> wrong version of jquery is unlikely
[18:41:03] <FoxRocks> ok good
[18:41:04] <FoxRocks> :)
[18:41:16] <FoxRocks> I hate it when it's those faults that trip me up
[18:41:40] <sillyslux> two click events, both on "body"?
[18:42:14] <FoxRocks> I need to post a screen shot
[18:43:45] <FoxRocks> https://snag.gy/7b0yoZ.jpg
[18:44:26] <FoxRocks> ugh, I hate getting so stuck on when usually ends up being a dumb mistake
[18:44:40] <FoxRocks> *what
[18:44:44] <sillyslux> yeah then $("#create-login-button").click either wasn't executed or didn't match
[18:44:52] <sillyslux> add debugger the line before
[18:45:02] <FoxRocks> I feel like it's not being executed
[18:45:02] <FoxRocks> ok
[18:45:06] <shoky> FoxRocks: as your screenshot shows, you're including jquery twice
[18:45:37] <FoxRocks> shoky: I just followed the source from jqueryui.com
[18:45:48] <FoxRocks> http://jqueryui.com/removeClass/
[18:45:49] <shoky> FoxRocks: jqueryui.com doesn't use laravel or bootstrap ;p
[18:46:01] <shoky> so you couldn't have just been following that, is my point
[18:46:05] <FoxRocks> no, I realize that.
[18:46:08] <FoxRocks> oh, I see :)
[18:46:33] <shoky> you've got both jquery.js  and jquery-1.10.2.js  included
[18:46:40] <FoxRocks> if it's relavent, this is the first bit of jquery that I'm adding to my Laravel app
[18:46:42] <sillyslux> FoxRocks> I have a question about the different jQuery releases. If there was some function that uses, let's say version 1.10.4and then I have another function that uses say version 1.11.4, do I have to load both, or would the newest one cover the older ones?
[18:47:08] <shoky> sillyslux: you should ideally never include jquery more than once ;]
[18:47:20] <sillyslux> that shouldn't mess with $("#create-login-button").click, you can do that later
[18:47:35] <sillyslux> i think
[18:47:51] <FoxRocks> Here is what I copied: https://snag.gy/TvVfaz.jpg
[18:48:18] <shoky> it can mess with it, if he adds the click handler, and then includes jquery again, which overwrites stuff from the 1st include, disrupting the event handlers from working..  not 100% sure that's his issue but it happens
[18:48:29] <sillyslux> shoky, what happens if you create eventListeners with one jquery and then load another, if it redefines $, is the eventListener then lost?
[18:49:07] <shoky> FoxRocks: when you do right-click -> view-source  that's the exact html that appears?
[18:49:18] <sillyslux> ok great, i've seen wordpress site with >5 jqueries :D
[18:49:21] <FoxRocks> in the fiddle? yes
[18:49:38] <shoky> sillyslux: i don't remember the exact details, just that stuff goes wrong ;p
[18:49:41] <FoxRocks> well...wait
[18:49:50] <shoky> FoxRocks: i don't care about the fiddle , the fiddle works fine ;p
[18:49:55] <FoxRocks> no, it's the relevant part of the form
[18:50:00] <FoxRocks> :)
[18:50:12] <FoxRocks> oh! are you asking about my screenshot?
[18:50:24] <FoxRocks> that's from the jquery toggleClass page
[18:50:30] <shoky> ya , ths one.. <FoxRocks> Here is what I copied: https://snag.gy/TvVfaz.jpg
[18:50:32] <FoxRocks> just showing why I added the jquery scripts like I did
[18:50:43] <shoky> dude i just want to see your html that your browser is loading
[18:50:54] <FoxRocks> https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/8/
[18:50:55] <shoky> do  right-click on your page, and view-source
[18:51:02] <FoxRocks> That's got the section of the form
[18:51:10] <shoky> that's not the html that your browser is loading..
[18:51:15] <FoxRocks> sorry, I just misunderstood which part you were asking about
[18:51:21] <shoky> all of it.
[18:51:22] <FoxRocks> ok, one sec
[18:52:03] <FoxRocks> here it is: http://laravel.io/bin/32lrO
[18:52:06] <FoxRocks> (sorry)
[18:52:30] <shoky> ok, as you can see you're including jquery multiple times
[18:52:33] <shoky> don't ;)
[18:53:35] <FoxRocks> I just moved the jquery from that screenshot to the bottom of the list and it's working
[18:53:48] <shoky> don't move it
[18:53:50] <shoky> remove it
[18:53:51] <shoky> :)
[18:53:52] <FoxRocks> So, that sort of leads back to my other question about jquery versions
[18:54:08] <shoky> the version is not the issue here
[18:54:14] <shoky> loading it multiple times is the issue
[18:54:33] <shoky> you're loading jquery, then jquery-ui, then jquery again.
[18:54:48] <shoky> the 2nd jquery includwe will overwrite the jquery namespace and the jquery-ui stuff wont work
[18:54:52] <shoky> and other stuff
[18:55:23] <FoxRocks> right, that makes sense
[18:56:01] <FoxRocks> I've run into this before, just not knowing which version to load. For example, now that I removed it, I'm getting an error saying jquery is not defined
[18:56:22] <FoxRocks> meaning: how can I tell which one to load?
[18:56:24] <sillyslux> the way i see it, it shouldn't mess with $("#create-login-button").click though
[18:56:47] <shoky> if jquery is not defined, that's not a version issue either ;p
[18:56:58] <shoky> it means jquery hasnt been included yet, probably
[18:57:11] <shoky> for example, if you include jquery-ui before jquery
[18:57:38] <FoxRocks> I'm trying to think how to phrase this correctly..
[18:58:04] <shoky> sillyslux: it's probably just messing with the .toggle(effect)
[18:58:17] <sillyslux> ah
[18:59:49] <FoxRocks> This is what typically happens. I want to use some jquery, let's say the .toggle(), so I insert the libraries as shown on the jquery site for that event. Then, later on I want to use another script, let's say .click(), so I do that same thing because the versions don't match exactly.
[19:00:14] <FoxRocks> I'm always wondering, do I need them all? If no, how do I know which ones to use?
[19:00:21] <shoky> no reason to use a different version for toggle and click..
[19:00:25] <shoky> use the latest?
[19:00:29] <FoxRocks> those were just examples :)
[19:00:30] <sillyslux> i just take latest
[19:00:40] <sillyslux> or whatever jquery-ui suggests
[19:00:55] <shoky> latest jquery ui works with latest jquery
[19:01:01] <shoky> so just take latest and you're good ;p
[19:01:09] <sillyslux> yay
[19:01:27] <shoky> latest stable, anyways
[19:01:55] <FoxRocks> ok, so that answers my previous question: does the latest version include everything from the previous ones?
[19:02:00] <FoxRocks> which, is yes of course
[19:02:05] <FoxRocks> and that would make sense.
[19:02:21] <shoky> except stuff that's been removed cause it was bad/not used much/other reasons
[19:02:23] <FoxRocks> what's the difference between:
[19:02:29] <sillyslux> if you look at the jquery docs, it always says e.g. ".click( handler ) version added: 1.0"
[19:02:58] <sillyslux> and ".click( [eventData ], handler ) version added: 1.4.3"
[19:03:25] <sillyslux> and deprecations are also mentioned
[19:03:59] <FoxRocks> http://laravel.io/bin/d9o03
[19:04:40] <FoxRocks> So in this example, I have added the first two because that's what the .toggle() wanted. When I remove them, the bootstrap switch complains that it's not loaded.
[19:05:11] <FoxRocks> removing the first two made the toggle work
[19:05:24] <FoxRocks> so the problem I've had all day is that I was reloading different versions of jquery
[19:06:28] <FoxRocks> Does that make sense?
[19:06:32] <sillyslux> oh wow, sorry to hear that
[19:06:41] <FoxRocks> :)
[19:08:03] <sillyslux> but you're still very lucky, compared to wordpress users who enable tons of plugins, each with their own jquery and no idea how and where to clean that up
[19:09:00] <FoxRocks> yes, that does sound horrible
[19:09:45] <shoky> FoxRocks: bootstrap stuff and jquery-ui both require jquery, bootstrap switch thingy probably requires bootstrap. so i'd just first try loading in this order:  jquery latest, jquery-ui latest, bootstrap, bootstrap-toggle
[19:10:52] <sillyslux> "Plugins can be included individually (using Bootstrap's individual *.js files), or all at once (using bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js)."
[19:11:03] <sillyslux> so bootstrap-toggle is enough
[19:11:34] <shoky> it's not a built-in plugin, i think?
[19:11:47] <shoky> i mean, not part of bootstrap package
[19:11:54] <sillyslux> yes it is
[19:12:03] <shoky> oh oks
[19:12:40] <sillyslux> not
[19:12:43] <sillyslux> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/js
[19:13:58] <sillyslux> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v2.3.2/js
[19:14:08] <sillyslux> i see no bootstrap-toggle.js
[19:14:21] <FoxRocks> I have this: http://laravel.io/bin/KkxKz
[19:14:24] <shoky> ya its 3rd-party
[19:14:34] <FoxRocks> The switch is loading, but the toggle doesn't work
[19:15:16] <sillyslux> holy!
[19:15:37] <sillyslux> sry, i had no idea bootstrap-toggle was 3rd-party
[19:17:48] <sillyslux> so bootstrap and bootstrap-toggle then!
[19:19:18] <FoxRocks> yeah, it's a third party plugin that transforms checkboxes to switches
[19:20:19] <sillyslux> jquery ui stable ships with jquery 1.10.2? wtf?
[19:22:08] <FoxRocks> yeah, right?
[19:22:21] <sillyslux> jsfiddle suggests jq-2.1.4 with ui-1.11.4
[19:22:34] <FoxRocks> so I've got jquery 2.2.4 loading, but my switch doesn't show up, just a checkbox. Good news is the checkbox works!
[19:22:42] <shoky> FoxRocks: use change event instead of click , for that bootstrap-toggle thing
[19:23:18] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/9/ (click on the javascript settings button in js-editor pane)
[19:23:54] <FoxRocks> so just replace .click with .event?
[19:23:56] <shoky> working fiddle  https://jsfiddle.net/jrgbob6a/10/
[19:24:04] <shoky> FoxRocks: with .change
[19:24:26] <shoky> put your includes back in the order like you had them here  <FoxRocks> I have this: http://laravel.io/bin/KkxKz
[19:24:53] <FoxRocks> ok one sec
[19:27:12] <FoxRocks> Awesome!!
[19:27:15] <FoxRocks> It's working!
[19:27:27] <FoxRocks> that .change was the key, after getting the scripts sorted.
[19:27:38] <FoxRocks> Thank you guys SO much :)
[19:27:43] <sillyslux> at last haha )
[19:27:49] <FoxRocks> shoky & sillyslux
[19:27:56] <FoxRocks> appreciate your time and help :) :)
[19:28:00] <shoky> sweet. i got the hint just by looking here  http://www.bootstraptoggle.com/#events
[19:28:11] <shoky> using a .change there as you can see ;p
[19:28:20] <FoxRocks> I gotta run, but I'm sure you'll see more of me now that I'm getting into the javascript part of my sute
[19:28:24] <shoky> no probs
[19:28:29] <FoxRocks> nice!
[19:28:32] <FoxRocks> ok, ttyl
[19:28:38] <shoky> seeya
[19:28:43] <sillyslux> fun fact, i had .change in one fiddle but then the checkbox missed the checkmark...
[19:28:54] <shoky> ;p
[19:29:06] <sillyslux> well good luck then ;)
