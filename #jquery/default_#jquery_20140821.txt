[01:11:37] <Lehl0r> hey there, im running a dbscan on a javascript webworker... however since it is O(n^2) it takes forever to calculate the clusters in js. ( i have 10.000 points to compare which results in 1.000.000.000 operations. ) Is there anyway to speed up the performance since it still feels that it takes very long?
[02:07:33] <basiclaser> hey guys, how could i put an svg image inline in an img tag? :)
[02:09:17] <Cork> bashusr: uh you don't really
[02:09:29] <Cork> you could base64 encode it and use data: uris
[02:09:41] <Cork> but not sure that would be recommended
[02:09:56] <Cork> if you really need the svg to be inline just put the svg tags in the html
[02:21:09] <Carty> hey guys, has anyone used JSSor?  I need help installing it
[02:47:27] <Carty> http://www.jssor.com/development/index.html
[05:04:09] <thaifood> Is there any way to trigger a form submit without submitting the form,  same as a submit listener with e.preventDefault();
[05:05:02] <thaifood> I created delegate listeners for the sections of my form but my validation only validates when a form is submitted or a field is modified
[05:05:27] <thaifood> so i'm trying to trigger the form submit without submitting it and without changing all of my buttons over to submit buttons
[05:20:54] <Cork> thaifood: well you can do $('form').submit()
[05:21:13] <Cork> and that is a shorthand for a more descriptive $('form').trigger('submit')
[05:21:34] <Cork> but yes if no event handler does preventDefault
[05:21:37] <thaifood> but if the form is valid it will submit the form which i can't have
[05:21:40] <Cork> that will trigger a submit
[05:21:59] <Cork> thaifood: you could send a value with it i guess
[05:22:12] <Cork> and that is a shorthand for a more descriptive $('form').trigger('submit', 'no submit')
[05:22:24] <thaifood> so i have these sections of a long long form and i need to use buttons to show/hide and trigger validation of the sections
[05:22:27] <Cork> $(document).on('submit',
[05:22:29] <Cork> opps
[05:22:47] <Cork> $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(event, submit) { if(submit == 'no submit') {} }
[05:23:23] <Cork> thaifood: also you can trigger validation of the form without submitting it
[05:23:29] <Cork> at least if you use jquery.validate
[05:23:36] <thaifood> i am using jquery.validate
[05:23:44] <Cork> then just ask it to validate the form
[05:23:57] <thaifood> i was told i could only trigger on field value change or a submit, is there another way ?
[05:24:23] <thaifood> so just:  $("#application").validate();
[05:24:38] <Cork> $('#form').valid()
[05:25:00] <thaifood> that only returns true/false and doesn't display validation errors by the fields
[05:25:08] <Cork> hmm
[05:25:20] <Cork> hmm i've seen it done
[05:25:28] <Cork> would have to dig a bit to find how though
[05:25:41] <thaifood> seems i'll have to trigger it on every element:  $("#application").validate().element("#gender_female");
[05:26:59] <Cork> thaifood: http://jsfiddle.net/URQGG/
[05:27:11] <Cork> looks like it should do the highlight
[05:27:13] <thaifood> man you are fast
[05:27:18] <Cork> no i just googled
[05:27:25] <thaifood> hehe
[05:27:53] <prohobo> googlefu
[05:27:59] <prohobo> oh god
[05:28:21] <prohobo> why did i get spammed with pms for saying that
[05:28:40] <thaifood> that works, sweet, thanks Cork
[05:28:45] <Cork> :)
[05:28:47] <Cork> np
[05:28:52] <thaifood> $("#application").valid();
[05:29:06] <thaifood> runs the validation and displays any messages
[05:29:07] <Cork> that is what i said before though ^^'
[05:29:16] <Cork> <Cork> $('#form').valid() <--
[05:29:26] <thaifood> yeah for some reason i was confused and thought i had tested it and it didn't work
[05:29:38] <thaifood> most excellent
[05:29:48] <thaifood> you're a great help to this channel
[05:30:27] <Nomikos> Is there a shortcut to get all values of selected inputs, regardless of type? something like serialize() except without a form, it's just a subset of inputs
[05:31:47] <Cork> Nomikos: you should ALWAYS have a form
[05:31:59] <Cork> browsers expect it to give full features to the user
[05:32:18] <Cork> but yes yo can do $(':input').serialize()
[05:32:24] <Nomikos> Cork: this is a form that it shown in three stages, I want to submit the values as the user goes from one to the next via ajax
[05:32:32] <Cork> through i strongly recommend wrapping it in a form
[05:32:48] <Cork> Nomikos: doesn't really change it
[05:32:52] <Cork> just have multiple forms
[05:33:00] <Nomikos> the design is not mine and there are updates incoming, but I'll consider changing it
[05:33:27] <Cork> Nomikos: but ya i know what you talk about, i've been fighting that fight too
[05:33:34] <Cork> and i've won actually ^^
[05:34:14] <Nomikos> they'll still be ajax'd posts. I'm too tired of the thing to make major changes in this thing >.>
[05:34:26] <Nomikos> .. so tired grammar went boom
[05:34:36] <Nomikos> anyway, thanks
[05:34:58] <Cork> Nomikos: ya, having a form doesn't mean it should not use ajax or anything
[05:35:19] <Cork> it just means you should do it grammatically correct for html
[05:35:38] <Cork> (input fields without a form is grammatically meaningless in html)
[05:36:22] <Nomikos> validates, though
[05:36:35] <Cork> sure, the spec doesn't dictate it
[05:36:57] <Cork> but keyboard input, accessibility tools, password store, auto fill and so on
[05:37:02] <Cork> all depends on the form tag
[05:37:35] <Cork> also the new autocomplete form feature planed for html (where the browser fills in the fields from an address book and so on)
[05:37:39] <Cork> all depends on the form tag
[05:37:56] <Cork> so you should be very strict with always having a form tag
[05:38:03] <Cork> for your own good
[05:38:12] <Cork> (and the user)
[05:44:20] <thaifood> if console.log(data); returns:  {"returnStatus":"success"} how come  console.log(data["returnStatus"]);  returns undefined ?
[05:44:28] <Nomikos> hrmph, I'mma wait for the updates, then hammer them into separate forms
[05:44:53] <Cork> thaifood: typeof(data)
[05:45:38] <thaifood> string
[05:45:42] <Cork> there you go
[05:45:47] <Soluzar> Is there a way to have all sections of an accordion open by default, but still be collapsible?
[05:45:50] <Cork> the server sends text not json
[05:45:51] <thaifood> where do i go ?
[05:46:10] <Cork> the server should send Content-Type: application/json not text/html
[05:46:11] <thaifood> so i need to convert it to json ?
[05:46:20] <Cork> thaifood: the server lies
[05:46:30] <Cork> can you fix it?
[05:46:37] <thaifood> i'm doing this in laravel.  return json_encode(array('returnStatus'=>'success'));
[05:46:55] <systemfault> thaifood: AFAIK, laravel doesn't work like that.
[05:46:59] <Cork> you need header('Content-Type: application/json');
[05:47:23] <thaifood> hmm not sure where to put that
[05:47:26] <systemfault> thaifood: return Response::json($data); in your controller
[05:47:32] <Cork> ah
[05:47:34] <thaifood> ahh
[05:47:36] <Cork> so not pure php
[05:48:10] <Soluzar> About that accordion question?
[05:48:11] <slax0r> Cork: you do not _need_ to set content type
[05:48:29] <thaifood> that works, yay !
[05:48:29] <Cork> slax0r: if you want to send json yes you do
[05:48:30] <systemfault> slax0r: You do or else the web server is lying...
[05:48:35] <thaifood> systemfault: you rock
[05:48:39] <thaifood> Cork too !
[05:48:40] <Cork> else the server sends text not json
[05:48:42] <systemfault> thaifood: Thank you sir.
[05:48:46] <slax0r> no, you don't
[05:48:49] <Cork> yes you do
[05:48:51] <slax0r> I rarely set it
[05:48:56] <Cork> the content-type states what you send
[05:48:58] <systemfault> slax0r: You're a sloppy programmer.
[05:49:03] <thaifood> Object { returnStatus: "success" }
[05:49:06] <thaifood> nice
[05:49:14] <systemfault> thaifood: Glad I was able to help.
[05:49:15] <slax0r> systemfault: is that so?
[05:49:19] <thaifood> and then console.log(data["returnStatus"]); gets me "success"
[05:49:19] * Cork nods
[05:49:26] <slax0r> and response content type is always application/json
[05:49:28] <systemfault> slax0r:Looks like it.. if you don't care about the basics of the web.
[05:49:34] <thaifood> cool
[05:50:34] <systemfault> slax0r: If you use a framework, you don't need to specify it, the framework will do it for you.
[05:50:37] <Cork> slax0r: so you have a server config that defaults to json
[05:50:55] <thaifood> do you guys ever had days where you spend days on some dumb thing and then other days where you are 100% productive and just cooking, i like 100% days better
[05:51:23] <systemfault> thaifood:Yes, productivity is like a rollercoaster for most programmers.
[05:51:34] <thaifood> yeah seems to be
[05:51:53] <slax0r> systemfault: exactly, meaning you don't _need_ to set it ;)
[05:51:56] <Cork> often it is from external factors for me
[05:52:04] <thaifood> that's even worse
[05:52:10] <slax0r> thaifood: when I'm productive I'm not cooking, I'm codding, when I'm not, I'm stalking irc channels :P
[05:52:12] <Cork> slax0r: as in need to set it i mean as in the http response
[05:52:20] <Cork> who sets it there doesn't matter
[05:52:44] <slax0r> Cork: yeah, maybe it would be better to say "_you_ don't need to set it"
[05:53:00] <Cork> slax0r: still a bit misleading
[05:53:06] <Cork> but ya, not i get what you meant
[05:53:10] <MikeD_> .extend() makes a shallow copy of an object, but the properties that refer to objects remain references to those objects... is there a simply way to have empty versions of those objects?  (create a new/blank array instead of referencing the original's array)
[05:53:29] <Cork> MikeD_: .extend(true, {}, old)
[05:53:51] <MikeD_> damn, is that "rtfm" ? :(
[05:53:55] <Cork> ya
[05:54:15] <Cork> jQuery.extend( [deep ], target, object1 [, objectN ] )
[05:57:14] <Soluzar> So I'm settled on just making them separate, single-section accordions.
[05:57:18] <MikeD_> ok, on a third read of extend, i now see the use of passing   true
[05:57:41] <Soluzar> That's not as satisfying as if the facility existed to do what I'm asking, but I'll take it.
[06:11:08] <MikeD_> Cork:  if you could take a look at this fiddle, I'd appreciate a second set of eyes before I employ the hack http://jsfiddle.net/oz9038na/
[06:11:33] <Sendoushi> hey guys. what alternatives do you know for d3?
[06:11:56] <MikeD_> why do you need an alternative for d3?
[06:12:32] <Cork> MikeD_: extend doesn't work like that
[06:12:56] <Cork> b will be b:[{p:2}] as you extend the src object
[06:13:07] <Cork> if you want to reset a key you would have to set it manually
[06:13:40] <MikeD_> yup, thanks
[06:13:59] <Cork> though t3 seams to do it
[06:14:00] <Sendoushi> MikeD_: sorry for the delay
[06:14:09] <Cork> that is a bit worrying though...
[06:14:26] <Cork> as that would imply extending arrays doesn't work
[06:14:41] <Cork> ah
[06:14:42] <MikeD_> when you're using a wrench as a hammer, you can't complain about the poor experience
[06:14:44] <Cork> no it wasn't deep
[06:14:48] <Sendoushi> MikeD_: i need to do some graphs and i just want to go with the best option for this case. i was looking at highcharts but... expensive. D3 is nice but with a lack of time to develop the graphs... hard
[06:15:10] <MikeD_> did you look a sparkline ?
[06:15:14] <Sendoushi> so... researching for "all" the alternatives for a careful decision
[06:15:17] <Sendoushi> no... going to :) thanks
[06:15:52] <MikeD_> if you just need a simple chart, it's super-easy to use
[06:18:23] <Sendoushi> MikeD_: one thing that i like in highcharts is the "zoom" ability in some graphs
[06:19:04] <MikeD_> yeah, that would probably require a bit more DIY :)
[06:19:24] <MikeD_> but you have events you can use to do whatever you might need
[06:19:54] <wa5ted> grafi_: yo
[06:20:28] <wa5ted> dedondee: dont send spam
[06:40:08] <NoiseEee> who has a favourite 'tag creator' plugin.. ie: something like https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it but not so old
[06:40:33] <MikeD_> i have no suggestion, but how old is too old?
[06:43:25] <BillCriswell> Why the hell do people spam IRC.
[06:43:28] <NoiseEee> MikeD_: ideally, jquery 2.0 but anything over 1.8
[06:43:34] <BillCriswell> Especially freenode.
[06:43:56] <NoiseEee> so irritating BillCriswell
[06:44:29] <MikeD_> i feel like that's equivalent to asking "Why are there potholes?"
[06:44:46] <BillCriswell> Haah
[06:44:53] <Cork> you mean pms?
[06:45:18] <Cork> BillCriswell?
[06:45:47] <BillCriswell> PMs are fine but I mean just like clicing everyone and sending them links to products or whatever.
[06:46:03] <Cork> ah
[06:46:12] <MikeD_> because there are still people in the world who click on that junk
[06:46:13] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/#selected-and-disabled-support This cames to mind, but I wonder how easy it would be to get items from a remote data source.
[06:46:18] <Cork> limiting pms to registered nicks usually helps
[06:46:30] <Cork> or plainly +g
[06:46:34] <NoiseEee> thanks BillCriswell
[06:46:46] <NoiseEee> wow Cork i didnt even know you could do that
[06:46:57] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Yeah, but people in here are way more technically savvy.
[06:47:03] <MikeD_> I worked for a spammer... they spent a lot of time sending emails nobody in their right mind would click on... but we had a lot of traffic
[06:47:17] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Got another spammer: gotusaa
[06:47:37] * AdamPDotty imagines women thinking to themselves: a way to no more pms!
[06:47:38] <NoiseEee> right, so annoying
[06:47:51] <Cork> NoiseEee: +R prevents unregistered nick from pming you
[06:47:53] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I can understand why they may do to a shitload of random people but freenode is a weird target.
[06:47:56] <Cork> and +g prevents everyone
[06:48:07] <BillCriswell> Cork: Nice.
[06:48:36] <MikeD_> true
[06:48:52] <BillCriswell> Cork: Is tha like... /msg MsgServ +R or something like that?
[06:49:04] <BillCriswell> I know how to join channels and connect to freenode and that's about it.
[06:49:04] <Cork> /mode <nick> +R
[06:49:10] <BillCriswell> Oh nice.
[06:49:11] <MikeD_> but spammers generally do not think deeply about audiences... else they'd be targeted marketers instead of spammers
[06:49:38] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I'd be very curious as to how they arrive at freenode though.
[06:50:42] <MikeD_> freenode is one of preloaded networks in the IRC client?
[06:51:17] <phx> it's quite popular among opensource community regardless
[07:06:18] <RobertZ23> hi all
[07:13:47] <BillCriswell> RobertZ23: Ayyyy
[07:15:18] <BillCriswell> RobertZ23: That's my "Hi"
[07:15:40] <RobertZ23> hahaha
[07:15:46] <RobertZ23> ok
[07:21:47] <MikeD_> BillCriswell is the Fonz
[07:22:04] <RobertZ23> does somebody know where can i find non-profit web projects that use python-django-css-html-javascript-jquery?
[07:22:22] * BillCriswell gives MikeD_ the thumbs up.
[07:43:15] <XHFHX> Hi. Can someone help me? I need some jquery in my python project and i'm a complete noob in jquery. I created a 2nd div with jquery and need to access it. I have readt that you use "keyup" for it, but it won't work while I bind it. Heres the code, problem is in the section //video2: https://gist.github.com/capital-G/28c89ab7980eac22510f
[08:00:01] <Ashugeo> Hi !
[08:00:33] <Ashugeo> Is there anyone ?
[08:00:41] <thaifood> Anyone know how to convert mm-dd-yyyy to an iso date that moment js won't be angry about ?
[08:04:28] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/f2z8L4a4/ -> is this the right way to do the .resize()? the console.log is updating appropriately. But... my .css top var isn't updating for some reason.
[08:05:50] <BillCriswell> thaifood: You can give it the date just like that.
[08:06:16] <thaifood> BillCriswell: nah they changed their minds:  https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1407
[08:06:48] <thaifood> i got it with this nuttyness http://laravel.io/bin/Bd5z3
[08:07:00] <BillCriswell> thaifood: moment('12-17-1984', 'MM-DD-YYYY');
[08:07:02] <thaifood> moment doesn't want to use friendly strings anymore
[08:07:09] <thaifood> hmmm
[08:07:18] <thaifood> let me see if it complains about that
[08:08:44] <thaifood> nice, that seems to work fine, much better, thanks BillCriswell, you go to the head of the class
[08:08:51] <BillCriswell> Yessssssss
[08:19:28] <printForever> guys
[08:19:42] <printForever> how the hell do I select the 2nd level li tag
[08:19:43] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/hdDYqtV8
[08:20:01] <printForever> I cant do it with .next()
[08:20:58] <printForever> or even the 1st level <li>
[08:22:18] <printForever> anyone?
[08:22:50] <thinkxl> printForever: $('li').eq(1)
[08:23:13] <thinkxl> printForever: but I think is better to use the css way
[08:23:35] <printForever> when I click <a>
[08:23:43] <thinkxl> printForever: $('li:nth-child(1)');
[08:23:47] <thinkxl> not sure if that works
[08:23:49] <printForever> I want to do something to the 2nd <ul>
[08:24:07] <thinkxl> printForever: add a class to that `ul` and use the class
[08:24:12] <robertmaxrees> thinkxl reducing down and chaining methods is generally faster.
[08:24:24] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: so css way better
[08:24:46] <robertmaxrees> $('li').eq(1) is faster.  $('li:nth-child(1)'); is slower.
[08:24:49] <thinkxl> printForever: if you can setup a jsfiddle we can give you better solutions
[08:25:44] <printForever> thinkxl
[08:25:45] <printForever> one moment
[08:26:16] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: got it, I missunderstood what you said
[08:27:19] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/ good info here for selector performance.
[08:27:42] <thinkxl> cool, lets see

[08:44:53] <robertmaxrees> relative URLs to your file structure and no ajax.,
[08:45:12] <maxmoore14> no ajax would solve the cors issue I think
[08:45:16] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[08:45:16] <maxmoore14> how do I disable it?

[08:45:59] <robertmaxrees> ^ first answer to this SO post.
[08:47:21] <maxmoore14> robertmaxrees: trying it now
[08:47:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll also have to rework your app.
[08:47:46] <robertmaxrees> and go to full pageloads or a single-page application.
[08:51:05] <maxmoore14> ok, thanks for the help
[08:54:39] <maxmoore14> robertmaxrees: I use localStorage in my app but IE doesn't support localStorage for files served off the drive - any suggestions for an alternate technique?
[08:58:10] <supreme__> possible to handle 404 of urls when doing ajax jsonp?
[09:00:51] <robertmaxrees> ajax and jsonp are separate
[09:01:11] <robertmaxrees> you can use $.ajax() to fetch jsonp, but it's not really ajax.
[09:01:18] <robertmaxrees> check out the .fail() callback for more.

[09:19:10] <adam-_-> I have an issue with (I think) simplemodal. If I close the modal and then re-open it, none of my event handlers seem to be registered anymore. Anyone know what's going on there?
[09:19:31] <robertmaxrees> adam-_- the modal probably gets destroyed.  use event delegation maybe?
[09:20:29] <adam-_-> okay… let me try googling around that
[09:20:42] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for .on()
[09:20:49] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[09:22:07] <adam-_-> Okay yeah, I think that makes sense, thanks. I'll give it a go.
[09:28:43] <Brycetron> duch_kazetel yo
[09:29:18] <robertmaxrees> hey man
[09:29:23] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:30:06] <rik316> So I have two arrow buttons( previous and next ) that are created dynamically when a page is loaded. They're used for navigation ( conditionally showing sequential divs ). I'm trying to stop my video player from playing when one of those buttons is clicked. If i run my code in the dwev console it works fine and it functions as expected but when I include it in the page, it seems to have no effect.  http://pastebin.com/uDUuK1rg
[09:30:43] <rik316> I used on to ensure that it would be bound to the buttons no matter when theyre created, but it still doesnt work
[09:31:42] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[09:31:52] <robertmaxrees> on doesn't guarantee that inherently.
[09:32:27] <robertmaxrees> $(someParent).on("click", ".pre_slide, .nex_slide", function () { <-- someParent should be something that exists on pageload.
[09:34:15] <rik316> robertmaxrees, thank you :)
[09:34:20] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[09:50:12] <hugo_moss> what happens if a piece of code that is executed more than once, and contains a jquery on function statement?
[09:50:29] <hugo_moss> is that attached event handler overwritten?
[09:50:38] <robertmaxrees> it's attached multiple times.
[09:50:43] <hugo_moss> ahh
[09:51:50] <robertmaxrees> do your bindings outside of other functions generally.
[09:54:53] <hugo_moss> i have a callback function thats executed everytime there is an error on the page, i do an each on the l list of errors, and i only know the element in the each loop
[09:55:14] <hugo_moss> when i know the element i can attach the event handler
[09:55:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:55:37] <robertmaxrees> who do you only know in the loop?
[09:55:41] <decx> if this is #jquery where did i just chat with BillCriswell?
[09:55:50] <hugo_moss> #javascript
[09:56:04] <decx> oh right, ##frontend for all your ui, ux ... needs *plug*
[09:56:04] <robertmaxrees> #frontend
[09:56:09] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:56:11] <hugo_moss> robertmaxrees: one second while i collect my thoughts
[09:56:21] <decx> gotta package that one better robertmaxrees ;)
[09:56:24] <robertmaxrees> can you fiddle up what you're doing at all?
[09:56:49] <hugo_moss> i have input elements on the page, each element has a tooltip associated with it, and is shown only if that input has an error
[09:57:03] <hugo_moss> so each tooltip gets a unique id
[09:57:24] <hugo_moss> and the associated input is linked by an aria-describedby="unique_id"
[09:57:45] <hugo_moss> my problem is i dont know which element is being displayed unless im in this callback
[09:58:15] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to rethink how you've built your stuff out imo.
[09:58:26] <robertmaxrees> could you make a fiddle?
[09:58:42] <hugo_moss> theres a lot of code that i cant segregate out
[09:59:06] <hugo_moss> im using jquery validation
[09:59:12] <hugo_moss> and im using bootstrap tooltips
[09:59:20] <hugo_moss> popovers
[09:59:53] <robertmaxrees> you can include both of those plugins in jsfiddle/jsbin, but okay.
[09:59:58] <hugo_moss> on submit, showpopover errors
[10:00:15] <robertmaxrees> but why do you need to do the binding inside of that?
[10:00:19] <robertmaxrees> what does that handler do for you?
[10:00:25] <hugo_moss> well the problem is
[10:00:48] <hugo_moss> a large tooltip shows the tooltip on the associated input element
[10:00:57] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead, yo.
[10:01:04] <hugo_moss> if i click another tooltip and theres an error it shows another tooltip
[10:01:09] <hugo_moss> but if i go back to the previous tooltip
[10:01:19] <hugo_moss> the tooltip z-index isnt updated
[10:01:29] <hugo_moss> i need to update the z-index of the focused tooltip
[10:01:44] <hugo_moss> so basically the focused input with tooltip, is behind all the other tooltips
[10:01:57] <hugo_moss> even if its focused
[10:02:06] <hugo_moss> i was thinking of using closures
[10:02:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:02:24] <robertmaxrees> lol closures have nothing to do with that problem.
[10:02:30] <hugo_moss> ok
[10:02:33] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a scoping issue, it's an event binding issue,.
[10:02:51] <hugo_moss> you understand the problem though
[10:03:39] <hugo_moss> it probably is an event probelm
[10:03:49] <robertmaxrees> i don't really understand it, no.
[10:04:08] <hugo_moss> ok
[10:04:10] <robertmaxrees> bit sounds like what you really need is event delegation.
[10:04:12] <Mike817> hey all
[10:04:19] <hugo_moss> basically
[10:04:28] <robertmaxrees> so go read up on it :)
[10:04:48] <hugo_moss> i have two input elements, i click submit, validates, if error, show tooltip for each input element
[10:04:51] <hugo_moss> do you understand that?
[10:05:12] <Mike817> I'm getting a "TypeError: $ is not a function"  on this function jsfiddle.net/1zLpwdaz/.  Any idea why? I can't figure out what i'm messing up
[10:07:28] <hugo_moss> i think the problem is that you dont want to understand my problem unless i use a jsfiddle
[10:07:42] <thinkxl> lol
[10:08:00] <hugo_moss> i can never find help on irc
[10:08:02] <hugo_moss> i swear
[10:08:08] <thinkxl> hugo_moss: you don't know how to ask for it
[10:08:14] <thinkxl> hugo_moss: I got better help here than google
[10:08:18] <robertmaxrees> hugo_moss sure.
[10:08:37] <robertmaxrees> hugo_moss it's hard to help when we don't have your code, y'know?
[10:08:43] <robertmaxrees> like, how do I know what you're doing?
[10:09:09] <robertmaxrees> how is your markup structured?  etc.
[10:09:33] <thinkxl> hugo_moss: also is not irc people work to help you, they do because they are cool people
[10:09:45] <thinkxl> hugo_moss: they are just asking to do one thing to help them help you
[10:12:12] <hugo_moss> i usually get better help on stackoverflow
[10:12:18] <hugo_moss> only it takes a day to get a response
[10:12:27] <thinkxl> hugo_moss: then go there
[10:12:30] <hugo_moss> which is why i use irc
[10:12:32] <thinkxl> :)
[10:12:33] <robertmaxrees> sorry mano.
[10:13:04] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: I don't know how you do this all day
[10:13:06] <robertmaxrees> they have a lot more users than we do at any given moment.
[10:13:17] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: it helps you to learn more?
[10:13:24] <robertmaxrees> thinkxl it's pretty rewarding actually.  and yeah, I learn things, too/.
[10:13:47] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: cool
[10:14:09] <robertmaxrees> sometimes you give somebody that last little push they needed.  other times you point them to the docs.
[10:14:30] <thinkxl> yes, helping is actualy rewarding
[10:14:41] <robertmaxrees> helps me in my normal job to rethink problems, too.  that's what programming is mostly about for me - breaking down problems into their component parts.
[10:14:49] <Mike817> I'm getting a "TypeError: $ is not a function"  on this function jsfiddle.net/1zLpwdaz/.  Any idea why? I can't figure out what i'm messing up
[10:15:25] <robertmaxrees> Mike817 jquery is loaded before your scripts, yeah
[10:15:25] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:15:31] <Mike817> yeah
[10:15:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing any errors in that fiddle.
[10:15:45] <Mike817> the error happens after an input is focused on
[10:16:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeting it.
[10:16:38] <Mike817> me neither
[10:16:50] <robertmaxrees> err. wat
[10:16:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:19:15] <robertmaxrees> you said you were getting that error, and then you said you're not getting that error.
[10:19:16] <robertmaxrees> i am lost.
[10:21:45] <decx> you know what i don't want to read when the serverguy is on holiday and i do a quick fix for a client? 552-STOR denied: quota exceeded: used 3523.26 of 3500.00 upload Mb
[10:22:00] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[10:22:01] <robertmaxrees> ouch
[10:22:02] <Mike817> i'm not seeing the problem either
[10:22:04] <decx> and then the best part: 552 STOR: notice: quota reached: '.htaccess' removed
[10:22:06] <decx> :o
[10:22:11] <robertmaxrees> oh shit
[10:23:19] <decx> just leave the old file and tell me quota reached beforehand, cmon serverbro
[10:23:38] <decx> now i gotta dig for the admin account somewhere :>
[10:23:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's a little redonk.
[10:27:40] <pjds248> Hi Guys, can anyone edit my code, so it will use the first h1 tag after the my script? http://pastebin.com/2GyynKRx thanks!
[10:28:57] <decx> put it in a doc ready, remove the 2 add a 1
[10:29:48] <pjds248> decx: how do you put in doc ready? ill paste the whole code, hold on!
[10:31:06] <pjds248> so this is the whole code http://pastebin.com/fvYTmRHX I want to be able to select the h2 tag after the script, thanks!
[10:33:52] <decx> think about it
[10:34:06] <decx> you tell jquery to look for a h2 tag
[10:34:17] <pjds248> yeah?
[10:34:33] <decx> but that h2 tag doesn't exist yet because it's under where this script gets loaded and executed
[10:34:51] <pjds248> decx: yeah, i know about that, im not a javascript/jquery guy
[10:34:52] <decx> you put it a doc ready so that it waits
[10:35:11] <decx> $(function(){ my code })
[10:35:24] <pjds248> decx: ok thank, ill try that
[10:36:12] <hugo_moss> how can i check if an element already has an event handler attached for a certain event?
[10:37:36] <decx> it's in data
[10:42:36] <decx> there hugo_moss http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9vjukx7d/
[10:49:06] <robertmaxrees> lol hugo_moss
[10:51:43] <phoenixsun> I am trying to make a div float in from the left but be above the other divs but it conflicts with the content its sliding over : http://jsfiddle.net/c4r21ntn/
[10:58:54] <decx> how does it conflict exactly
[11:00:07] <phoenixsun> decx: the div that slides in avoids to contents on the div behind. I moves itself down
[11:00:14] <phoenixsun> to = the
[11:01:30] <decx> well position it absolutely then
[11:03:25] <phoenixsun> I tried that actuall
[11:03:28] <phoenixsun> actually
[11:03:32] <phoenixsun> did not go as hoped
[11:09:45] <naeluh_tues> hey my json is going nuts ?
[11:09:53] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[11:11:01] <naeluh_tues> yeah tell me about it I am getting this warning from chrome  EventSource's response has a MIME type ("text/html") that is not "text/event-stream". Aborting the connection.
[11:13:07] <robertmaxrees> bad headers.
[11:13:57] <naeluh_tues> so what do I do to fix that ?
[11:14:21] <robertmaxrees> fix yer server.
[11:14:51] <naeluh_tues> I am on jsbin
[11:15:53] <naeluh_tues> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/tiwuv/2/edit
[11:16:27] <robertmaxrees> it's probably an issue with "http://nhm.hulea.org/t1.json" ?
[11:17:14] <naeluh_tues> ok let me see thats actually from rackspace cloud files
[11:17:25] <robertmaxrees> just guessing.
[11:34:41] <naeluh_tues> yeah I cant get ti to work for shit
[11:35:56] <naeluh_tues> oh shit I think I know
[11:37:50] <naeluh_tues> I forgot to include the callback function in the hson file
[11:37:57] <naeluh_tues> *json
[11:38:06] <naeluh_tues> robertmaxrees: thanks
[11:38:15] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[11:38:36] <naeluh_tues> jsonpCallback this guy
[12:14:37] <METEMEDO> hey guys
[12:14:42] <METEMEDO> i have this: http://jsfiddle.net/su2vhfbg/1/
[12:14:55] <METEMEDO> the second button works exactly as i want
[12:15:01] <METEMEDO> but the first one doesn't
[12:15:49] <METEMEDO> so my question is, how can i access the button to pass to data while creating it, like in the button 1?
[12:17:08] <Cork> METEMEDO: the fiddle doesn't work, and it just has one button
[12:17:16] <Cork> so you might need to check over it again
[12:17:16] <METEMEDO> oO
[12:17:33] <METEMEDO> the fiddle is working for me oO
[12:17:48] <METEMEDO> oh wait
[12:17:52] <wunz> doesn't work for me either (firefox)
[12:17:59] <Cork> Uncaught ReferenceError: lang is not defined
[12:18:06] <METEMEDO> i had to update
[12:18:08] <METEMEDO> http://jsfiddle.net/su2vhfbg/2/
[12:19:13] <Cork> ah
[12:19:34] <Cork> METEMEDO: this on line 7 references window not saveBtn1
[12:19:49] <METEMEDO> yeah i'm aware of that
[12:19:51] <Cork> so you never give saveBtn1 a reference
[12:19:53] <wunz> ^ what cork said
[12:19:58] <METEMEDO> but that's just an example
[12:20:09] <METEMEDO> how do i access the object that's being created while creating it?
[12:20:15] <Cork> you can't
[12:20:19] <Cork> as it doesn't exist
[12:20:22] <METEMEDO> oh :(
[12:20:31] <METEMEDO> i like one-liners
[12:20:33] <Cork> so add an ; and then saveBtn1.on
[12:20:41] <Cork> well in this case you can't use it
[12:20:47] <METEMEDO> yeah like button 2
[12:20:56] <METEMEDO> ok thanks guys
[12:21:06] <Cork> well you could use .each(function() { $(this) })
[12:21:29] <Cork> but it is basically still two lines
[12:21:41] <METEMEDO> nah, not worth it :P
[12:21:42] <Cork> METEMEDO: that said though, why do you need to reference the same object again
[12:22:00] <Cork> the event will know what that element is anyway
[12:22:07] <METEMEDO> does it?
[12:22:17] <Cork> $(this) == e.data.btn
[12:22:56] <Cork> so replace e.data.btn.text('HA!'); with $(this).text('HA!');
[12:27:14] <METEMEDO> Cork: ha! lol
[12:27:20] <METEMEDO> that's right
[12:27:58] <METEMEDO> thanks
[12:28:55] <Cork> :)
[12:28:57] <Cork> np
[12:32:02] <shred> Hey guys, i'm trying to use this : targetElem.find('svg');  that i saw in doc... but im using angular and i cant find how to do that... ive been trying using $event and using the srcElement from it. but it doesn`t work... can anyone help me on that ? or something like document.getelementbyid('')find(...)
[12:34:01] <Cork> shred: the question doesn't fully make sense
[12:34:11] <Cork> so targetElem is a jquery object?
[12:34:21] <shred> its html div
[12:34:37] <Cork> that isn't an answer
[12:34:44] <Cork> is it a dom element or a jquery object
[12:34:50] <Cork> or a string
[12:35:22] <shred> The goal is to replace targetelemen with something like document.getelemn or somethin
[12:35:22] <shred> http://paste.ofcode.org/mZBsxzALtspjySKN8gx9RL
[12:35:32] <shred> dom element
[12:36:55] <Cork> can't really tell from the code
[12:37:07] <Cork> it sends mixed messages
[12:37:38] <Cork> or you are sure it is a dom element do $(targetElem).find('svg')
[12:38:04] <Cork> or just targetElem.getElementsByTagName('svg')
[12:38:19] <Cork> depending on what you want to do (as that isn't clear)
[12:46:43] <shred> well thats all the information i have
[12:49:56] <shred> in comment they say that targetelemn is a jquery objh
[12:49:58] <shred> ahhhh
[13:01:10] <hugo_moss> well robertmaxrees, i got it to work
[13:02:10] <hugo_moss> *claps*
[13:07:19] <METEMEDO> hey guys, if i pass a callback to a function as a parameter like func1(id, function() { btn.text('x'); })
[13:07:36] <METEMEDO> will func1 be able to have scope to btn ?
[13:07:57] <METEMEDO> knowing that btn is local to the calling function
[13:08:03] <Cork> METEMEDO: it won't be able to access variables inside the function if that is what you mean
[13:08:18] <Cork> the function could return the variable but that is it
[13:08:28] <METEMEDO> i will give you a snippet
[13:08:31] <METEMEDO> sec
[13:08:33] <Cork> var btn = callback()
[13:10:21] <Kneferilis> hello, suppose I use JQuery to do an ajax call, on success the ajax called was made, but how do I know for sure that the server side code did what I wanted (save to db) and that it didn't fail?
[13:10:36] <sacho> METEMEDO, no
[13:11:05] <sacho> METEMEDO, the outer scope for a function is determined when the function is defined. The inner scope is determined when it's called
[13:12:34] <b-lew> Is there a way to recalculate .height on window.resize?
[13:13:21] <METEMEDO> sacho: outer scope? inner scope? didn't understand :s
[13:13:25] <METEMEDO> here: http://jsfiddle.net/8pcgkw12/
[13:13:27] <METEMEDO> example
[13:13:29] <sacho> b-lew, what do you mean recalculate height?
[13:13:52] <sacho> METEMEDO, when you're in an "execution context"(a fancy way of saying, when you're executing code)
[13:14:00] <sacho> there's always an associated "scope chain"
[13:14:23] <b-lew> sacho - when the browser goes mobile my nav goes mobile and the height adjusts so the fixed div under the menu has a blank space.
[13:14:25] <sacho> (it's called a chain because it goes outer scope <- inner scope <- innermost scope)
[13:14:26] <METEMEDO> b-lew: window on resize -> height = window.height *123
[13:14:48] <b-lew> I'll past a jsfiddle.
[13:14:52] <b-lew> paste
[13:15:23] <sacho> that "scope chain" is determined by what function you're in
[13:15:32] <METEMEDO> hmmm
[13:15:32] <sacho> the innermost scope is a newly created one when the function was called
[13:15:53] <sacho> the outer scopes are the scope chain that existed when the function was defined
[13:15:56] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/s8x2a34t/ -> this .resize makes the scrolling act oddly and doesn't re-calculate the height
[13:16:04] <sacho> e.g. for your btn.text() function
[13:16:10] <METEMEDO> i see kind of
[13:16:19] <sacho> when you define it, you have the scope chain: global <- func2 call
[13:16:41] <METEMEDO> when func1 receives it it has global <- func1 only
[13:16:44] <METEMEDO> so doesn't know btn
[13:16:50] <sacho> yes
[13:16:54] <METEMEDO> makes sense
[13:17:24] <sacho> if you define func1 within func2 it would be able to see btn
[13:17:34] <METEMEDO> so will this work http://jsfiddle.net/8pcgkw12/1/ ?
[13:17:47] <METEMEDO> if i pass btn as a parameter in the callback ?
[13:17:50] <sacho> sure
[13:18:06] <sacho> oh
[13:18:10] <sacho> no
[13:18:18] <sacho> the callback doesn't need a `btn` parameter
[13:18:22] <sacho> it'll work just fine without it
[13:18:37] <METEMEDO> cuz in php i would need to do function() use($btn)
[13:19:04] <sacho> well, imagine that when you declare the callback, it automatically has a use(everything from the current scope chain)
[13:19:05] <METEMEDO> it will?
[13:19:25] <METEMEDO> aaaah then it does that, thats what i was asking in the first place :D
[13:19:45] <sacho> so it has use(btn, e(those are from func2), func1, func2(those are from global))
[13:20:30] <sacho> METEMEDO, do you use chrome?
[13:20:33] <METEMEDO> ok then! thanks a lot
[13:20:35] <METEMEDO> yeah
[13:20:48] <sacho> open the sources tab, place a breakpoint(click on the line) of the function
[13:21:04] <sacho> the sources tab of the dev tools*
[13:21:06] <METEMEDO> console.log() also helps a lot
[13:21:17] <sacho> when you hit the breakpoint, look on the right - you'll see scope variables
[13:21:30] <METEMEDO> ah yeah i've used that before
[13:21:32] <sacho> that's a detailed representation of what the function 'sees'
[13:21:57] <METEMEDO> btu sometimes is better to learn what's the behavior, instead of seeing whats happening
[13:22:12] <METEMEDO> because it may be happening because of another thing that you didnt realize
[13:22:25] <METEMEDO> and you start to think that's the default behavior
[13:22:36] <METEMEDO> and then comes chaos theory
[13:23:00] <METEMEDO> i may be crashing the whole internet next month
[13:26:13] <METEMEDO> bye guys, thanks sacho
[13:29:43] <sacho> o/
[13:29:52] <ash_m> what is the purpose of wrapping a statement like 'document.createElement('ELEMENT')' with $() ?
[13:31:06] <ash_m> or assiging html wrapped that way? ie: var ex = $('<input type="text" />');
[13:31:43] <decx> the second one will do createElement in the background
[13:31:53] <decx> no idea why anyone would do $(createElement)
[13:32:15] <NoiseEee> ash_m: both turn the new element into a jquery object
[13:32:35] <sacho> ash_m, the purpose in both cases is to both create a dom element, and to wrap it in a jquery object(enabling you to use all the jquery functions on it)
[13:33:28] <ash_m> sacho, NoiseEee so... you'd have to write something like $(document.create...).jqueryFunction(function(){...}); ?
[13:34:24] <sacho> depends what you want to do
[13:35:22] <ash_m> sacho: I see no reason to wrap a createElement line unless you wanted to perform jquery functions on it, like you said, but if that's the case, that's how you'd write it right?
[13:36:38] <ash_m> unless, I guess you did something like var ex = $(...createElement...); ex.jqueryMethod(function(){...});
[13:37:29] <ash_m> is it valid/preferred to preface such variables with a dollar sign? ie: var $ex = $(...); ?
[13:37:46] <sacho> I like prefacing variables that are supposed to hold jquery objects with $, yeah
[13:38:56] <ash_m> ah, I see; also, I am generally accustomed to looking for functions that can execute other functions when they finish; though recently I've seen several things like....
[13:39:08] <ash_m> $(selector).function().function().function()...
[13:39:43] <ash_m> do all these methods execute simultaneously?
[13:39:48] <sacho> no
[13:39:55] <sacho> that's usually called a "fluid interface"
[13:40:14] <sacho> what happens is each function returns `this`
[13:40:30] <sacho> it's equivalent to $(selector).function();$(selector).function();...
[13:41:19] <sacho> you can't have simultaneous execution in js - js is completely synchronous :)
[13:41:19] <ash_m> sacho: I see, and they percolate forwards? ie: $(selector).func1().func2 = $(selector).func1; $(selector).func2; ?
[13:41:49] <ash_m> sacho: yes, that is a rule I had forgotten ;\
[13:41:52] <sacho> I think you're missing some braces
[13:41:52] <ash_m> :\*
[13:42:07] <ash_m> sacho: regardless... I'm trying to type fast :\
[13:42:15] <sacho> but yeah.
[13:42:51] <ash_m> sacho: do all javascript 'objects' work this way?
[13:43:14] <sacho> no, it's not a feature of objects at all
[13:43:31] <ash_m> sacho: I mean providing you return "this"
[13:43:44] <sacho> well...sure.
[13:44:09] <ash_m> I guess you have to return 'this' on all the methods you employ....
[13:44:17] <sacho> you can immediately use the return value of a function
[13:44:21] <sacho> e.g.
[13:45:13] <ash_m> so does it work like obj1.method1.method2 => execute method1 obj1 becomes obj created by method1, execute method2 on new object?
[13:45:27] <ash_m> method1 on obj1*
[13:45:42] <jonez> greetings. I have two lines of code that are apparently not being run. the syntax is fine (checked with jsl). any clues? $("meta[http-equiv='refresh']").remove();  $("header").append("<meta http-equiv='refresh' content='"+delay+"; url="+url+"'>");
[13:46:29] <__joshua___>  $("header")?
[13:46:41] <sacho> (function foo() { return "hello"}()).indexOf("ello").toString() -> "1"
[13:46:41] <sacho> ash_m, it'd work like (obj.method1()).method2(), yes.
[13:46:42] <sacho> so, call the function property "method2" on the return value of "obj.method1()"
[13:46:46] <decx> it's head not header, and why not just change content instead of removing
[13:47:02] <__joshua___> jonez: $('head')
[13:47:06] <jonez> I can do that.. what happens if that tag does not exist?
[13:47:28] <sacho> well, you wouldn't modify anything
[13:47:50] <ash_m> sacho: thanks. I appreciate you clarifying some of that :)
[13:49:45] <ash_m> there's not like a .rand() method for jquery? that surprises me actually
[13:51:39] <BillCriswell> ash_m: You can make one pretty quick.
[13:51:54] <BillCriswell> but not sure why you'd want to handle that through jQuery.
[13:52:34] <ash_m> BillCriswell: yeah, I'm looking that now, but it just seemed like there would be something simple and nice with jQuery making things a bit more readable.
[13:52:40] <ash_m> BillCriswell: :: shrug ::
[13:53:27] <BillCriswell> function rand(max) { return Math.floor(Math.random() * max); }
[13:55:29] <decx> "random"
[13:56:14] <decx> how would that apply to jquery anyway
[13:56:18] <decx> dont you mean a shuffle
[13:56:51] <phoenixsun> is there is thing like css doesn't load on elements that are not on screen at load time?
[13:57:09] <Cork> phoenixsun: no
[13:57:14] <phoenixsun> specifically you have a slider that starts offscreen then comes on when you click a button
[13:57:20] <phoenixsun> cos that what I am getting
[13:57:29] <Cork> is the css inline?
[13:57:50] <phoenixsun> no. Funnily enough inline css works. But the classes don't
[13:57:58] <phoenixsun> its like doesn't see them at all
[13:58:06] <Cork> doesn't make sense
[13:58:14] <phoenixsun> certainly not to e
[13:58:28] <phoenixsun> I thought maybe I named the classes wrongly
[13:58:33] <phoenixsun> so I checked that over and over
[13:58:42] <Cork> use the dev tools and check
[13:58:49] <Cork> might be something overriding things
[13:58:59] <phoenixsun> thats been open the whole time
[13:59:11] <phoenixsun> but I will look deeper and see if I spot anything
[14:07:51] <tushigushi> Hi, a little noob question here: are there any conditions why a div might not response to .click method? Like something to do with CSS or something else? Thanks in advance!
[14:08:29] <dopie> hey guys
[14:08:49] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/2c8ee348b15e31ff90f4
[14:09:10] <phoenixsun> Cork: I created more classes and linked to content on that same div. No joy. What do I look for?
[14:09:16] <__joshua___>  tushigushi:  there is a semi supported css directive for ignoring mouse events, pointer-events:none i think
[14:09:28] <dopie> I am told thats the wrong way to show/hide another area?
[14:09:35] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/2c8ee348b15e31ff90f4
[14:09:58] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/Lv40ujgm/ -> is there anything wrong with calling .topNavBlock in this if statement?
[14:10:50] <Cork> phoenixsun: the css list should show you if the style is actually applied on the element
[14:11:21] <phoenixsun> Cork: its not being applied and  don't know why
[14:11:34] <Cork> phoenixsun: so it isn't listed at all?
[14:11:39] <phoenixsun> nope
[14:11:41] <Cork> or are they crossed out?
[14:11:47] <phoenixsun> no nothing at all
[14:11:56] <Cork> then the selector is wrong
[14:12:05] <phoenixsun> only some globally inherited stuff
[14:12:15] <phoenixsun> well I have written 3 more.
[14:12:15] <Cork> look at the selector then
[14:14:02] <phoenixsun> ok it was something silly. Don't know why Sublime didn't flag it
[14:15:07] <tushigushi> joshua: I mean I want to make it works, but it doesn't can't find why, the code is very simple, and it works for other divs, but not for those that are needed.
[14:15:55] <__joshua___> tushigushi: can you provide any code?
[14:16:27] <__joshua___> also, are you using real mouse events?  are you clicking on a child that is preventing propagation?  what happens if you trigger the click programmatically?
[14:20:45] <tushigushi> joshua: yep it's a child div, in fact it is double child div
[14:26:11] <lonimurar> I'm using .after() to insert an <a> after a specific element. I would then like to bind an event handler to the click event on the inserted <a>. Is there an elegant way of doing this in one step?
[14:26:42] <tushigushi> joshua: when apply same  $("#....").click(function() {alert ('hello')}); onto another div which is not part of that <div> cluster it works fine.
[14:30:49] <__joshua___> and if you $('yourdiv').trigger('click')?
[14:31:23] <tushigushi> joshua: awww foundit! My divs wera actually buried behind bigger transparent div, I changed z-index and it works now.
[14:31:56] <tushigushi> thats was stupid of me :/
[14:32:10] <__joshua___> right click inspect element ftw
[14:34:09] <tushigushi> joshua: thanks for help, sometimes problem is easier to solve when you share it.
[14:34:23] <__joshua___> definately
[14:36:28] <lonimurar> Nvm about my question, found a solution.
[14:57:48] <phoenixsun> to get the vertical centering its 'display: inline-block;
[14:57:48] <phoenixsun> 	vertical-align: middle;
[14:57:48] <phoenixsun> }?
[14:58:01] <phoenixsun> or is there a better way?
[14:58:22] <phoenixsun> ooops wrong channel
[15:03:40] <ash_m> phoenixsun: erm... no
[15:04:29] <ash_m> phoenixsun: there are a couple ways to achieve vertical centering but that is not it
[15:05:06] <phoenixsun> ash_m: please do share:)
[15:05:29] <tejas-manohar>  is anyone pretty familiar with proxies and oauth?
[15:05:33] <tejas-manohar> https://github.com/tejas-manohar/gatekeeper — im trying to use this in a client side javascript project, it basically is supposed to allow me to auth with github without any server side code on my app specifically
[15:05:39] <tejas-manohar> would my app url for Github’s api portal be the heroku app i put this proxy on or the github pages url i put the clienrt side stuf on
[15:06:03] <ash_m> phoenixsun: well, I think the easy way is to use display: table; but it requires some wrappers... let me look up the one I found easiest...
[15:06:50] <phoenixsun> ash_m: I have been using display: table as my go to for horizontal centering
[15:09:34] <ash_m> phoenixsun: Ah HA! I knew I had it somewhere: http://www.andy-howard.com/verticalAndHorizontalAlignment/index.html
[15:09:48] <stwalcher> Hey guys, I'm looking for somewhere to ask a question about Datatables. Would I have any luck here?
[15:10:01] <ash_m> phoenixsun: anyway, you can also use absolute positioning http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/
[15:10:14] <ash_m> phoenixsun: or you can fake it with padding.
[15:11:25] <phoenixsun> I was going to take it with padding. But I am trying to do it cleanly lol
[15:11:45] <ash_m> phoenixsun: but vertical-align: middle is for inline elements. (unless you're using tables, see "vertical-align on inline elements" http://phrogz.net/css/vertical-align/ )
[15:12:14] <ash_m> phoenixsun: for horizontal centering, text-align: middle usually does the job
[15:12:44] <ash_m> phoenixsun: or you can set a width and use margin: 0 auto; but that depends on the scenario
[15:13:35] <phoenixsun> ash_m: I will run though the links and see where I get. But thanks in advance!
[15:14:58] <ash_m> phoenixsun: the other way to accomplish the same feat without using a translate rule is by setting a height/width, use position: absolute and set all sides (right, left, top, bottom) to 0 (zero)
[15:16:18] <ash_m> phoenixsun: however with that method you might have to go through some trickiness to center the content if you incidentally anticipate the content to be bigger than it's container for any reason.
[15:16:25] <phoenixsun> ash_m: yeah your second link is going that way. So I will try iy
[15:16:44] <phoenixsun> but no its pretty static in that div
[15:17:01] <ash_m> phoenixsun: gtg for now, let me know how it turns out! :)(
[15:17:03] <ash_m> :)
[15:17:12] <phoenixsun> thanks. later. !
[15:19:02] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/2c8ee348b15e31ff90f4
[15:19:06] <dopie> I am told thats the wrong way to show/hide another area?
[15:19:13] <dopie> it works but is that the correct way?
[15:33:40] <ornerymoose> Why isn't the accordion method working here?  'undefined is not  a function' http://jsfiddle.net/btow2xwo/6/
[15:34:27] <Zzaichik> gots to load your accordion plugin
[15:37:07] <ornerymoose> Zz: isnt it part of the jquery ui?
[15:44:06] <decx> with 2.x (edge) the jq ui only includes the css
[15:44:10] <decx> probably a bug
[15:59:35] <phoenixsun> how do you pass an array to the jquery autocomplete function?
[16:01:47] <ornerymoose> decx: ah i see
[16:05:52] <ornerymoose> decx: changing to jquery 1.9.1 in the fiddle did the trick. Thank you for the headsup
[16:22:53] <pycasso> what is the proper way to get an elements data value? $(this).attr('data-item-id') or $(this).data('data-item-id') ??
[16:25:53] <__joshua___> is is a property or an attribute?
[16:26:27] <__joshua___> ie you have rendered it in html (<div data-x="y">) then use attr('data-x')
[16:26:55] <robertmaxrees> .data('x')
[16:27:03] <robertmaxrees> avoid .attr() when you can.
[16:27:07] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() or .data()
[16:27:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:27:11] <__joshua___> $.data will check the attribute first, but when setting, it will not use the attribute if it is undefined
[16:27:32] <robertmaxrees> $(element).data() is preferred.
[16:27:42] <robertmaxrees> you want to used the cached version, not the attribute.
[16:34:46] <phelix> Anyone in here done much parallax work?
[16:36:21] <phelix> Maybe someone can check out my custom parallax site and give me some pointers lol http://www.mindimage.net/
[16:37:13] <phelix> its super simple right now. But want to make it much more complex with the wheels rotating on the car and sun scrolling through and do the clouds a bit better and then have it fade to night and some larger clouds with content roll through.. Trying to think of a good way to calculate or make it work. Just lookin for some ideas
[16:59:07] <sammych> what's the name of the 'feature' that lets you assign values/attributes/objects to an element? or is that just 'the DOM'?
[16:59:26] <robertmaxrees> the DOM is the API that you hook into.
[17:36:52] <ZogDog> Mongoose / EJS / jQuery Select2 question (http://jsfiddle.net/fy86mjx0/) How do I save a select2 option that includes two inputs back to a mongoose schema that's an array of objects, each object containing values from the two inputs?
[18:20:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm pleaseantly surprised every time i use vanilla javascript these days.
[18:20:42] <droid909> guys how do i trigger this: $('#outerdiv').on("click","#inner"  ?
[18:20:52] <droid909> i.e. with delegate
[18:20:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:21:01] <robertmaxrees> you trigger with .trigger()
[18:21:11] <robertmaxrees> $('#inner').trigger('click');
[18:21:19] <stef1a> how do you allow a function to always be running and to not be run just once? i currently don't have any function code, just this: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Q6qP0ttM
[18:21:36] <robertmaxrees> stef1a huh?
[18:21:40] <droid909> robertmaxrees: no need to do anything with the #outer?
[18:21:46] <robertmaxrees> droid909 nope.
[18:21:51] <droid909> robertmaxrees: good ,thanks
[18:21:52] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: what i currently have seems to run just once
[18:22:06] <robertmaxrees> stef1a right - you need to hook to the change event of that element.
[18:22:22] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery on\
[18:22:22] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: but i don't want it to be run when the element changes
[18:22:22] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:22:31] <robertmaxrees> stef1a then clarify your question.
[18:22:42] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: i want it to be run when it changes, but also immediately on the page's first load
[18:23:06] <robertmaxrees> write a function and run it immediately after, then bind to the cjhange.
[18:23:08] <robertmaxrees> *change
[18:23:35] <stef1a> can you point me to a resource that explains how to do that?
[18:23:44] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[18:24:04] <robertmaxrees> because those are both fairly self explanatory.  can you write a function?
[18:24:32] <dllama> guys quick question, is there a listener i can attach to a button to figure out exactly what is causing a preventDefault?
[18:24:37] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: yes, i'm unsure about running it immediately after and binding
[18:24:47] <droid909> robertmaxrees: what if i want to trigger it but html is not there, i.e. i want to execute what is inside my handler?
[18:24:58] <robertmaxrees> stef1a http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/czr32vav/1/ it'd look like this.
[18:25:04] <robertmaxrees> droid909 you can't do that.
[18:25:29] <robertmaxrees> droid909 you should pull your function out and explicitly call it instead.
[18:26:12] <droid909> robertmaxrees: yup, had the same idea, thanks
[18:27:26] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: that's perfect. thank you!
[18:27:46] <robertmaxrees> stef1a sure.  might want to take a basic js course.
[18:27:54] <robertmaxrees> also, learn.jquery.com is pretty good.
[18:27:56] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: that's what i'm doing right now :-)
[18:28:07] <stef1a> except piecemeal rather than linear...
[18:28:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:28:41] <robertmaxrees> don't pick and choose tutorials.  they should build on themselves.
[18:29:23] <stef1a> what i meant is, i'm learning pretty much solely by doing and picking stuff up as i go rather... mixing some pure reading in there would help, though.
[18:29:39] <stef1a> -rather
[18:30:02] <stef1a> (if you want to shove a tutorial in my face, be my guest)
[18:30:12] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com ;)
[18:30:19] <robertmaxrees> also i think there's a JS tutorial on MDN
[18:31:39] <stef1a> okay, thanks! i'll try it out.
[18:32:25] <robertmaxrees> dllama you can look at the handlers attached to something.
[18:32:40] <dllama> robertmaxrees: i think i found a workaround
[18:33:18] <robertmaxrees> never did like that word
[18:33:35] <dllama> seems REALLY half assed the way i'm doing it, but it works,… for this app i modded the hell out of a theme and 1 of the 24832940382490238493048 plugins they're using is reeking havoc on me
[18:33:52] <dllama> this is my workaround: $(".popover-content form .btn").off().on("click", function(){$(this).parents('form').submit()});
[18:34:17] <robertmaxrees> submit vs. click?
[18:34:21] <robertmaxrees> something else is wrong.
[18:34:39] <dllama> its a dropdown search form
[18:35:04] <dllama> i think they have a preventDefault on the entire breadcrumb area,
[18:35:20] <dllama> its like 5k lines of JS and its much easier to just do it that way than find exactly where they blocking it
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> not making sense, but ok.
[18:35:34] <robertmaxrees> that adds to the problem long term :(
[18:35:46] <dllama> not disagreeing at all
[18:36:03] <dllama> but time constraints dictate actions lol
[18:36:04] <robertmaxrees> so glad i have discretion at my current gig.
[19:15:18] <crocket> When I pass an XHTML string to $.parseXML, it spits an error like "&nbsp; not supported"
[19:15:34] <crocket> There is a spammer here called lammy
[19:15:52] <crocket> lammy sends spams in PM sessions.
[19:15:58] <crocket> Hello?
[19:16:00] <robertmaxrees> i'll take a look.
[19:16:15] <crocket> robertmaxrees, a look at &nbsp;?
[19:16:20] <robertmaxrees> can you supply and example that shows the error?
[19:16:22] <robertmaxrees> and lammy
[19:18:09] <crocket> robertmaxrees, Where can I upload a file?
[19:18:16] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle works.
[19:18:20] <robertmaxrees> gists work, too.
[19:20:06] <crocket> robertmaxrees, http://pastebin.com/3VayKTdV
[19:20:14] <crocket> Pass that to $.parseXML
[19:20:42] <robertmaxrees> pastebin might cause an issue here, but let me try.
[19:21:16] <robertmaxrees> wait this isn't a valid string
[19:23:47] <crocket> robertmaxrees, right
[19:23:54] <crocket> robertmaxrees, I'm sorry
[19:30:17] <crocket> $.parseXML can't parse &nbsp;
[19:30:33] <crocket> I'm not sure $.parseXML could parse &O; as well.
[19:30:58] <robertmaxrees> errr
[19:31:04] <robertmaxrees> you need to feed it a valid js string first.
[19:31:07] <crocket> Is there a DOM parser?
[19:31:19] <robertmaxrees> make a valid js string first.
[19:31:47] <crocket> robertmaxrees, It is a valid js string if you load it via HTTP request.
[19:32:11] <robertmaxrees> something about this smells to me, but okay.
[19:32:28] <robertmaxrees> and that error sounds like a browser issue, not a parseXML issue
[19:32:32] <robertmaxrees> but i could be wrong.
[19:32:36] <crocket> I think there is $.parseHTML

[20:30:36] <scottbuckel> I'm trying to trigger click on an <button type="submit" id="my-button"> and I'm getting the weirdest error - "Cannot read property "top" of undefined". WTF! Been working on it for 30 mins now, any clue?
[20:31:21] <BillCriswell> scottbuckel: The issue doesn't sound like the trigger.
[20:32:42] <scottbuckel> BillCriswell: If I click the button without .trigger('click') or .click(), it works fine
[20:32:48] <scottbuckel> What else could it be?
[20:32:54] <scottbuckel> The button is selected fine..
[20:33:06] <scottbuckel> that error cannot read property is in bootstrap.js for some reason, wtf?
[20:33:35] <BillCriswell> scottbuckel: Are you getting like the position of the mouse top or something? Think we'd need a demo here.
[20:33:56] <scottbuckel> No, I have a button in the DOM, I'm selecting it, and triggering .click(), that's it
[20:34:00] <scottbuckel> one sec i'll paste code
[20:35:18] <scottbuckel> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/VCswB8gs
[20:37:02] <BillCriswell> scottbuckel: What happens in #edit-continue's click even though.
[20:37:25] <scottbuckel> BillCriswell: I think I found the issue, I think it's a Drupal related JS since it's ajax-enabled
[20:37:26] <scottbuckel> http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/97077/programatically-trigger-a-click-on-an-ajax-enabled-form-field-button-select-e
[20:37:48] <BillCriswell> Yuck.
[20:38:18] <scottbuckel> yup, that was my issue
[20:38:27] <scottbuckel> makes my head spin, whaaaat is going on there
[20:38:40] <scottbuckel> how is a user's mouse click different from .click()?
[20:39:38] <BillCriswell> scottbuckel: I thought it might have something to do with other properties in the click event.
[20:40:14] <scottbuckel> Yeah, weird, oh well..stupid Drupal
[20:41:31] <BillCriswell> scottbuckel: http://jsbin.com/qomajikoseho/1/edit?js,output compared the first event that's logged and the one that shows up when you actually click.
[20:42:08] <Uhkis> Drupal.behaviours
[20:47:00] <scottbuckel> BillCriswell: Sorry, I don't follow you
[20:47:47] <BillCriswell> scottbuckel: Just how many fewer properties there are when the click happens programmatically.
[20:48:05] <scottbuckel> ohh
[20:48:16] <scottbuckel> yeah, makes sense
[20:54:07] <IPhoton> is there a way to like go into a website with jQuery with the URL and extract the inner content of a div?
[20:56:29] <BillCriswell> It depends on the other site. If the other site doesn't allow it directly you'd need to set up a proxy on your end.
[20:57:02] <IPhoton> I mean regular web pages
[20:57:09] <IPhoton> like wordpress pages, not in backend stuff
[20:57:46] <tbmiller> if you know the contents of the element in advance you can set them up in an array and just scrape the contents in general
[20:57:57] <tbmiller> I think I've seen a node application do something like that
[20:58:52] <BillCriswell> You couldn't do that with front-end javascript though unless CORS or something was enabled.
[20:59:04] <tbmiller> http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/scraping-the-web-with-node-js
[20:59:15] <BillCriswell> IPhoton: I mean on your own server.
[20:59:45] <IPhoton> Well I am creating a simple phone app and have a lot of regular pages on a Wordpress site whihc is mine
[20:59:51] <IPhoton> and I don't want to manually copy and paste
[21:00:16] <IPhoton> using jquery mobile and phonegap, so I dont' think I can use anything but javascript
[21:00:23] <BillCriswell> Are the requests hapening from the same domain? Like are you at blog.com and requesting a page on blog.com?
[21:01:40] <IPhoton> no no, it's going to be iphone app. http://freeremoteinstructions.com/
[21:01:51] <IPhoton> need to extract the content of the middle page
[21:01:57] <IPhoton> of each one, and there is like 700
[21:02:25] <BillCriswell> Are you requesting pages from freeremoteinstructions.com though?
[21:02:55] <IPhoton> yes
[21:03:00] <IPhoton> this is what I have so far
[21:03:01] <IPhoton> http://imgur.com/FwqHQ5Z
[21:03:47] <IPhoton> so after I click on Acura, it will look for the year, then go to another jquery mobile page and extract the main content
[21:07:30] <BillCriswell> Does the page you want to request live on this domaim?
[21:07:50] <IPhoton> yes, BillCriswell, they are all in there
[21:08:51] <BillCriswell> IPhoton: Ok, then you can use $('.div-to-load-content-in').load('/page-you-want.html .content-from-page-you-want');
[21:09:46] <IPhoton> now on the load(), can it be absolute URL?
[21:10:32] <BillCriswell> if it's to the domain you're on sure.
[21:13:26] <IPhoton> okay, thanks BillCriswell
[21:13:30] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[21:13:38] <IPhoton> will try that, as soon as I figure out how to get it from an excel file XD
[22:26:28] <Greener> How can I create a new element without cloning something - like $(this).append(my_func()), where that function makes a new div or p or something?
[22:28:24] <Greener> Disregard, I think I found a SO answer
[22:34:11] <kate_r> hi
[22:34:30] <kate_r> in terms of conventional usage and design, are checkboxes and on/off switches interchangeable these days?
[23:14:34] <Dallas> Hello! I am currently looking for assistance on making edits to a hide/show page. I have the full code on copy. I want to change it so that the button remains visible.
[23:16:22] <Dallas> Here is the code I am trying to edit:
[23:17:07] <Dallas> $(function(){$('.main-head:has(.page-title)').prepend('<a class="collapse tcatCollapse" id="collapse_c_cat1" href="#top" style="visibility:hidden;float: right;margin-top: -3px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d7jXnmJ.png" alt=""></a>');$('.main-head:has(.page-title)').mouseover(function(){$(this).find('a.collapse[id]').css('visibility','visible')});$('.main-head:has(.page-title)').mouseout(function(){$(this).find('a.collapse[id]').css(
[23:17:29] <Dallas> Darn, not all of it fits.
