[10:53:15] <dimi1947> why this is not working? https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/jnry5zmt/2/
[10:53:20] <dimi1947> very weird
[10:54:55] <shoky> dimi1947: the code only runs once on page load - its not checked on page load
[10:55:14] <dimi1947> i see...
[10:55:34] <dimi1947> how do I fix it?
[10:56:26] <shoky> if you want to do the check each time the radio is selected/deselected, add a 'change' event handler
[10:57:22] <shoky> e.g. $('input[name=buztype]').on('change', function() { if (this.checked) { alert(...); })
[11:10:15] <dimi1947> give me a minute to test...I just want to check something
[11:13:53] <dimi1947> well not exactly what I was searching for....but I made a modification and now is OK
[11:50:29] <dimi1947> can a div(or other element) be appended to a label tag?
[11:57:33] <dimi1947> it seems it cannot
[12:47:49] <pavonia> dimi1947: You can append elements, but not a div or other block elements (or what they are called) specifically
