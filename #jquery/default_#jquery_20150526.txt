[00:39:53] <[1]dimi1947> forget what I said...
[00:40:01] <Woet> you didn't say anything.
[00:40:15] <[1]dimi1947> I will rephrase the question better later
[00:40:25] <Woet> you didn't ask a question.
[00:42:09] <Uhkis> :D
[00:44:45] <IamTrying> Help Me. http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/streetViewReflectionMapping/#51.023894399999996,4.101267000000007  how can i just get the street view and not all the rest?
[00:45:13] <IamTrying> I want to put a Bike on the street so i need to remove all the rest. how?
[00:45:56] <Woet> IamTrying: look at the source code or read the google maps API docs?
[00:46:33] <IamTrying> OK - Woet, i just need the Streets moving forward or backward or left right so that i can place a bike and drive as 3D.
[00:46:44] <Woet> IamTrying: that's not a "just"
[00:46:51] <IamTrying> :)
[00:47:10] <Woet> IamTrying: but same answer.
[00:49:35] <IamTrying> OK - found it something like this http://theoryapp.com/my/web/rotating-panorama.html
[00:50:24] <[1]dimi1947> is there any way I can use breakpoints in fiddle?
[00:50:32] <sailendra_> hello there
[00:50:37] <sailendra_> greetings!!!
[00:51:06] <[1]dimi1947> greetings
[00:52:21] <sailendra_> i am using one plugin for inline data editing,,when ever i try to call function its says it is not a function error
[00:53:55] <Uhkis> you're probably trying to use it before loading it
[00:55:59] <sailendra_> Uhkis: library is loaded
[00:56:49] <Woet> sailendra_: www.jsfiddle.net
[00:57:02] <Woet> working demo of your issue please.
[00:59:29] <sailendra_> Woet: please wait let me upload code
[01:00:36] <Omar-> good morning
[01:04:59] <sailendra_> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/02oaarrr/ here is  the js code
[01:05:27] <Woet> sailendra_: i did say _working_ demo
[01:05:49] <sailendra_> Woet: its in my local app so no possible way to show you demo
[01:05:59] <Woet> sailendra_: why not?
[01:06:21] <Woet> sailendra_: copy/paste the code responsible for the problem, load the required libraries/dependencies and trigger the error
[01:06:50] <sailendra_> Woet: http://mindmup.github.io/editable-table/ can you check this example
[01:07:02] <Woet> sailendra_: no, because it doesn't demonstrate your problem.
[01:07:35] <sailendra_> Woet: this is the same library which i am using from github where same code is not working
[01:07:50] <Woet> sailendra_: the code works fine on that link.
[01:08:10] <Woet> sailendra_: that's why, again, i ask you for a _working_ demo that demonstrates your problem
[01:08:51] <sailendra_> Woet: i can show only via teamviewer is that possible for you
[01:09:00] * Woet sighs
[01:09:02] <Woet> sailendra_: copy/paste the code responsible for the problem, load the required libraries/dependencies and trigger the error
[01:09:08] <Woet> it's fairly straight forward
[01:25:26] <[1]dimi1947> I have some problem adding input elements to the DOM on second iteration... https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/v6vujo86/29/
[01:25:47] <[1]dimi1947> click the plus sign....first
[01:27:19] <[1]dimi1947> after that click the minus sign to remove the last inserted inputs....and click the plus sign again....and open the console
[01:28:03] <[1]dimi1947> the signs appear on mouseenter
[01:29:03] <[1]dimi1947> on hover I meant
[01:32:18] <Bear10> When you set a listener on an element, does that listener disappear when you replace the element with replaceWith?
[01:53:32] <Cork> Bear10: yes, as you're replacing the element
[02:01:17] <kokut> Hello, how do you select the third list item in a list with a bunch of <li></li> ?
[02:02:13] <kokut> Cork: $( ".parent:nth-child(3)" ).css( "font-weight","bold" ); is changing the stile of all the list lol
[02:02:50] <kokut> nvm fixed it sry
[02:03:38] <Bear10> Cork, alright thanks!
[02:04:53] <FilipNortic> Is it common to put all js in self executing functions not just plugins and some structures?
[02:05:12] <FilipNortic> maybe not the right channel for the question thought
[02:05:18] <Cork> FilipNortic: it is common to put it in some form of function
[02:05:32] <Cork> cause else you're executing in global scope, and that's a bad idea
[02:06:22] <FilipNortic> well $(document).ready is a function right?
[02:06:28] <Cork> ya
[02:06:35] <Cork> well rather
[02:06:41] <Cork> the function you pass to it is
[02:06:46] <Cork> (function() {} <--
[02:10:53] <FilipNortic> just got saw some code that seemed strange to me event the document.ready was wrapped in it's own self executing function
[02:11:10] <FilipNortic> /s/event/even
[02:11:44] <Cork> FilipNortic: they might need a shared variable with a function not inside the ready
[02:11:55] <Cork> or they are just wrapping it more then needed
[02:14:07] <FilipNortic> yeah I think they needed a shared variable in one place, above then decieded to wrapp everyting just to be sure... Harder for me to read, since I only do front end when I have to
[02:14:52] <Cork> FilipNortic: if they need a variable shared outside the ready callback, then a self executing function is recommended
[02:15:16] <Cork> basically you should never use a global variable unless actually everyone needs to have access
[02:15:28] <Cork> or everything if you prefer
[02:19:32] <kokut> Cork: is it wrong to apply a lot of styles via jQuery..?
[02:19:47] <Cork> kokut: yes, style should be in the stylesheet
[02:19:55] <kokut> :\
[02:19:57] <Cork> js should only trigger the style
[02:19:59] <kokut> too late lol
[02:20:04] <Cork> (ex through a class change)
[02:20:52] <kokut> but that takes a lot more work?
[02:21:03] <Cork> no, it usually takes less
[02:21:08] <Cork> cause you can reuse things
[02:21:19] <kokut> i'm even adding elements to tell in which page i'm so i add the style with jquery in the footer
[02:22:11] <kokut> the only downside i can see is that the user sees the site all messed up until its done loading and that it might use more resources?
[02:23:42] <Cork> kokut: 1. load time, 2. unstyled effect, 3. managability, 4. reusability
[02:23:50] <Cork> so ya, there are plenty of downsides
[02:26:25] <[1]dimi1947> cork how long have you been here?
[02:26:34] <Cork> donno
[02:42:29] <FilipNortic> ok one more thing, the structure "var x = function(self){...}(x||{});" does that save the return value of the function in x if it isn't null then it saves {}?
[02:43:05] <FilipNortic> can't find it on google don't know what to search for
[02:44:19] <Cork> function(self){...}(x||{}) means self becomes x unless x is falsy, then it becomes {}
[02:44:48] <FilipNortic> ahh ok thanks
[02:46:28] <[1]dimi1947> have you seen my message?
[02:47:36] <[1]dimi1947> about the problem I am facing...
[02:48:25] <Omar-> [1]dimi1947 the problem is in this var input=e.currentTarget.previousElementSibling.id;
[02:50:43] <Omar-> the next time you add, it returns <br> elements not <input>
[02:50:51] <[1]dimi1947> yes....
[02:51:12] <[1]dimi1947> it is a problem regarding DOM manipulation
[02:51:21] <[1]dimi1947> what can I do?
[02:52:26] <[1]dimi1947> As you can see I am using the event object to navigate the DOM and the issue ia that it has been altered when going to add inputs on second iteration
[02:52:37] <Omar-> https://jsfiddle.net/v6vujo86/31/
[02:52:57] <Omar-> you can remove <br> along with added input
[02:52:58] <Omar-> s
[02:53:07] <Omar->  $('input#from_wednesday_b,input#till_wednesday_b').prevUntil("#till_mond").addBack().remove();
[02:54:21] <Omar-> [1]dimi1947 ^^
[02:54:34] <[1]dimi1947> this is the line you added in the fiddle?
[02:54:38] <Omar-> yea
[02:54:45] <Omar-> modified, not added
[02:54:51] <Omar-> line 31
[02:55:04] <Omar-> I added .prevUntil("#till_mond").addBack()
[02:55:11] <Omar-> to remove <br>
[02:55:19] <[1]dimi1947> I did not know there were such methods?
[02:55:21] <[1]dimi1947> thanks
[02:55:33] <Omar-> you can achieve it in a better way
[02:55:53] <Omar-> instead of using <br>, wrap inputs in a div
[02:56:18] <Omar-> give that div a class and remove it with all its content
[02:57:42] <[1]dimi1947> I will look into it
[02:58:41] <Omar-> :)
[03:05:24] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, I have a huge block of html that is created and appended within javascript. Is there a way to take this html block out of the JS and load it differently?
[03:05:57] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: you could send it over ajax
[03:06:02] <Cork> or you could use a template engine
[03:06:24] <KnightsOfNi> with the load() method?
[03:06:36] <Cork> that's an option ya
[03:07:32] <KnightsOfNi> load can take a php page as well?
[03:07:54] <Cork> client site takes html
[03:08:05] <Cork> it doesn't care what you use server side to generate it
[03:08:30] <Uhkis> KnightsOfNi: it works like you'd use your browser to load the target page
[03:08:54] <KnightsOfNi> so in the php i just echo the html and then load the file?
[03:09:04] <KnightsOfNi> the html is dependend on the session
[03:12:58] <al-damiri> Can anyone point me to open source big apps created using jQuery Mobile?
[03:19:49] <Omar-> al-damiri what are you looking for in jQM?
[03:40:32] <KnightsOfNi> .load seems to always load content in the specified element, I would need var $newContent = $(load(x.php)); without displaying it
[03:40:42] <KnightsOfNi> how would that work?
[03:41:16] <Cork> ?api jquery.get
[03:41:38] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[03:42:12] <KnightsOfNi> could it be done without a server call?
[03:48:17] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: sure, through the template solution i talked about before
[03:48:36] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: then you store the template in a <script type="text/template"></script> section
[03:48:53] <Cork> and the template engine lets you fill placeholders with generated data
[03:49:25] <Cork> personal favorite http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[03:49:37] <Cork> handbrake, mustashe is two other well known engines
[03:57:36] <Uhkis> https://camo.githubusercontent.com/805474b63e6277e066533c2152e5699e33882345/687474703a2f2f64323477366273726862656839642e636c6f756466726f6e742e6e65742f70686f746f2f615a504e476f6e5f34363073612e676966
[03:57:44] <Uhkis> this guy is reason enough to use mustache! :D
[05:14:04] <dimi1947> when you have an input box...and you place the cursor in the box and click the mouse button WITHOUT TYPING ANYTHING THOUGH...what event do you have...if any?
[05:21:33] <Germanaz0> someone is good using strophejs ?
[06:14:16] <Jin^eLD> hi
[06:14:28] <randomguy1> hola
[06:15:02] <notchris> good morning
[06:15:34] <Jin^eLD> I am quite new to jquery (I know some extjs3) and I stumbled upon something that I don't really know how to handle :) maybe you guys can help me out, it goes like this:
[06:16:44] <Duvdevan> saerbia
[06:18:33] <Jin^eLD> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8834666
[06:18:47] <Jin^eLD> I pseudo-coded a minimalistic example to show my problem
[06:19:01] <Jin^eLD> basically things happen out of order here
[06:19:07] <Jin^eLD> I I don't get why...
[06:19:37] <Jin^eLD> how can the ajax call inside the callback function be executed *before* the console.log() statement?
[06:20:08] <Jin^eLD> or rather - why is it happening like that?
[06:20:09] <Jin^eLD> :)
[06:20:12] <Jin^eLD> any hints?
[06:21:10] <Jin^eLD> are the $.getJSON() things somehow global and are triggered somehow right away all at once regardless of their position in the code?
[06:22:04] <notchris> How do I hide something that is returned in a function
[06:22:30] <randomguy1> what do you mean hide?
[06:23:33] <notchris> nm
[06:23:36] <notchris> Figured it out haha
[06:25:57] <randomguy1> Jin^eLD: from what i can see of your code snipplet, I would assume the console.log does happen first.  Only thing I can guestimate at is maybe there is some delay in the execution and the flushing of the buffer so it just looks like it is not happening first.
[06:29:23] <Jin^eLD> randomguy1: well, the log is just an example, in reality the data is parsed before that log and used in the url "url" + stuff
[06:29:26] <Jin^eLD> and here's the catch
[06:29:51] <Jin^eLD> randomguy1: console.log prints something meaningful AFTER the ajax call, however the "stuff" value in the url is NaN
[06:30:23] <Jin^eLD> that's why I put console.log there in the first place
[06:30:34] <Jin^eLD> because I first thought that my parsing is bad
[06:30:43] <Jin^eLD> but it logs just fine
[06:31:08] <randomguy1> um, ok, so this may be a stupid statement but. your passing in "data" and then trying to use "stuff" ?
[06:31:08] <Jin^eLD> I'm really puzzled
[06:31:32] <Jin^eLD> randomguy1: stuff is parsed out of the data, its just a simple example, I can paste the whole thing but that would be just confusing
[06:32:43] <Jin^eLD> randomguy1: my point being that console.log(stuff) is OK while the url + stuff results in "url+NaN"
[06:32:48] <Jin^eLD> which I can not explain
[06:33:35] <Jin^eLD> randomguy1: this is a real snipplet https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8834670
[06:34:11] <Jin^eLD> and the ajax call i see in the debugger asks for /json/property/vdcquery?query=/getProperty(deviceId=NaN)/username
[06:34:28] <Jin^eLD> how is that possible if loggin this value is ok?
[06:34:32] <Jin^eLD> what am I missing?
[06:35:39] <randomguy1> is vdc.dSUID a numeric or a string?
[06:36:18] <Jin^eLD> should be string, I tried doing + String(vdc.dSUID) just to make sure, but that did not help either
[06:36:39] <randomguy1> just for shiggles, tryi doing vdc.sSUID.toString()
[06:36:48] <Jin^eLD> so from what I hear from you - my theory about execution order is not correct for this case?
[06:37:36] <randomguy1> i don't believe it's an async issue.  i think something else is going on since your getting the NaN
[06:37:49] <randomguy1> now if you were getting undefined, ;)
[06:38:25] <Jin^eLD> hmm no its still a NaN
[06:38:50] <randomguy1> weirdness
[06:38:54] <Jin^eLD> indeed
[06:39:01] <Duvdevan> document.write(null);
[06:39:02] <Duvdevan> solves everything
[06:39:10] <Jin^eLD> :)
[06:39:54] <VX> hi i got a circle on the slider with some custom text, i am setting the font size via JS but when the slide changes the CSS goes to the default size for the text, why would this be happening http://jsfiddle.net/p4pns3e0/
[06:42:02] <randomguy1> AH!
[06:42:03] <Jin^eLD> randomguy1: ok, once you reassured me that I am on a wrong path considering the idea that there are problems with execution I tried something that - for I do not know what reason - worked
[06:42:04] <randomguy1> Jin
[06:42:11] <randomguy1> you have two +'s
[06:42:15] <Jin^eLD> var url = "blabla" + vdc.dSUID + "blabla"
[06:42:45] <Jin^eLD> huh, where, what?
[06:42:47] <randomguy1> you had " + + vdc.dSUID
[06:43:00] <Jin^eLD> oh crap
[06:43:01] <Jin^eLD> the line break
[06:43:03] <Jin^eLD> dooooh!
[06:43:04] <Jin^eLD> :)
[06:43:17] <randomguy1> that second + was trying to do a type conversion
[06:43:55] * Jin^eLD hits himself
[06:44:04] <randomguy1> took me copying it over to jsfiddle to see, lol
[06:44:16] <Jin^eLD> :)
[06:44:52] <Jin^eLD> and I was googling on order of execution and so on and logging stuff - would have never found it going into that direction
[06:45:02] <Jin^eLD> thanks! :)
[06:45:07] <randomguy1> np
[06:48:58] <workerbeetwo> How to $.checked()  this field ?   <input type="radio" value="1" id="genderType:1" name="genderType"/
[06:51:06] <randomguy1> $('[name="genderType"]').prop('checked', true);
[06:52:54] <workerbeetwo> randomguy1: there is also a genderType:0  , how does it now which one to select?
[06:53:29] <randomguy1> true, one sec
[06:54:32] <VX> anyone got a sec to take a look at my text on slider issue
[06:55:24] <randomguy1> not sure that : is valid for an id field
[06:56:06] <workerbeetwo> randomguy1: jsf puts it in there. can't change that unfortunately.
[06:56:12] <dimi1947> I am using length to check if some input elements that their ID contains _b has been added to the DOM...this is the code $('input[id*="_b"]').length>0
[06:56:33] <dimi1947> the question is how can I find their full ID names?
[06:56:49] <dimi1947> I know for sure they contain _b
[06:57:32] <randomguy1> $('[name="genderType"][value="1"]').prop('checked', true);
[06:58:23] <randomguy1> dimi1947: after you get them you could do attr('id') or prop('id') to get their full id
[06:59:01] <workerbeetwo> randomguy1:
[06:59:39] <dimi1947> where I am going to add this attr('id')
[06:59:44] <workerbeetwo> randomguy1: $('#genderType\\:1').checked(true)   =>  undefined is not a function.
[07:00:25] <randomguy1> workerbeetwo: yeah i tried escaping the : with no luck.  I believe your going to have to use another selector like I did above combining the name and value lookup
[07:00:47] <dimi1947> var exist_el=$('input[id*="_b"]').length().attr('id'); is this what are you talking about?
[07:00:52] <randomguy1> afk, standup
[07:02:47] <workerbeetwo> randomguy1: thank you very much!
[07:06:07] <dimi1947> randomeguy...I tried what you said...it works but only for the first element that is added to the DOM...if 2 elements are added how can I get the IDs of both
[07:08:01] <decx> `api jQuery.map
[07:08:08] <randomguy1> dimi1947: back for a sec.  fixing to step away.  dimi, if you want to get them all checkout map()
[07:08:10] <decx> it's map
[07:08:14] <decx> damn bot
[07:08:31] <randomguy1> heh, decx has ya, :) afk a sec again
[07:10:31] <dimi1947> ok
[07:14:39] <dimi1947> yes map is a good solution
[07:32:34] <pauled> Hi, how can I make the chrome console on PAUSE before the dom element are dynamically changed?
[07:44:02] <callumacrae> I'm trying to animate the scrollLeft of something until the user manually scrolls, how can I tell the difference between a user-generated scroll event and a me-generated scroll event?
[07:44:13] <giulini>  does anyone know a good tool for automatic testing of HTML pages? i
[07:44:44] <callumacrae> giulini: mocha for the tests, jquery for the dom stuff
[07:45:04] <callumacrae> Or QUnit instead of mocha
[07:54:36] <randomguy1> callumacrae: you could make your me-generated scroll event go through another event to know.  such as $(whatever).on('systemScroll', function(){ ... });  and inside that function before he does the scrolling have the check to make sure the user has not scrolled already, or whatever you need
[07:55:01] <randomguy1> giulini: what kind of automated tests are you after?
[07:55:03] <callumacrae> I'm not firing the event, I'm calling .animate({scrollLeft:20})
[07:56:21] <giulini> randomguy: i have a web application developed on turbogears framework, i need to execute some common actions of the users and see what happens
[07:58:50] <randomguy1> giulini: ah, you might try mocha that call suggested.  the ones I might suggest require a license key
[07:59:29] <giulini> randomguy: ok  I will try it
[07:59:52] <giulini> randomguy: i prefer without using something without license key
[08:00:13] <randomguy1> :), if you were using grails I'd suggest geb, but alas, :(
[08:00:25] <pauled> rawgit seems down?
[08:00:57] <callumacrae> pauled: up for me
[08:00:58] <callumacrae> https://rawgit.com/Lostmyname/monkey/master/gulpfile.js
[08:01:22] <pauled> for me it lag
[08:01:36] <pauled> and it don't load correctly
[08:01:37] <callumacrae> did you get yourself blacklisted?
[08:01:59] <shoky> stuff isn't loading for me either
[08:02:00] <pauled> No I don't thik so, I use only once
[08:02:03] <shoky> for example https://rawgit.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/src/reagent/core.cljs
[08:02:19] <callumacrae> that file is very slow for me
[08:02:29] <callumacrae> oh, you did it wrong?
[08:04:22] <pauled> getting in console: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT
[08:05:05] <callumacrae> isn't this the correct url? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reagent-project/reagent/master/src/reagent/core.cljs
[08:07:51] <pauled> yes, it's supposed to be a raw file
[08:08:48] <pauled> looking for alternative to rawgit
[08:10:11] <giulini> randomguy: i read mocha documentation.. but i did not get one point: how do i open the web page?

[08:17:25] <callumacrae> giulini: via a server
[08:17:29] <callumacrae> it's a client-side testing framework
[08:17:53] <callumacrae> https://github.com/Lostmyname/monkey/blob/master/test/index.html
[08:17:56] <callumacrae> that's how I load it
[08:20:57] <flobin> hi all
[08:21:04] <flobin> anyone know why I’m getting the TypeError: $(…).offset(…) is undefined? http://output.jsbin.com/diwazerupe (when you click a link in the black nav bar)
[08:22:29] <giulini> callumacrae: ok i will try following the example
[08:24:56] <rindolf> flobin: what are you doing to trigger it?
[08:25:02] <decx> flobin id is case sensitive
[08:25:03] <callumacrae> flobin: are you actually loading jquery?
[08:25:11] <decx> maybe
[08:25:14] <flobin> decx: oo that might be it, let me check
[08:25:20] <callumacrae> oh ignore me
[08:25:32] <decx> yep that's it
[08:25:43] <decx> woningen vs Woningen in the href
[08:26:31] <flobin> decx: awesome, thank you so much!
[08:41:21] <giulini> callumacrae: sorry but i never did tests for web application.. how can i with mocha open the page of my application and there put some data in a form?
[08:42:31] <callumacrae> I can't explain UI testing from scratch, sorry
[08:42:36] <callumacrae> I'd recommend searching for a book or tutorial
[08:42:56] <callumacrae> maybe check out selenium, sounds more like what you want, too
[08:43:34] <adv_> how can i use animate to transition from the bottom right corner to the middle of the screen?
[08:43:58] <adv_> animate a solid rectangle growing from 20x20 to 640x480
[08:45:33] <gambl0re> i create a new jquery file but it doesnt seem to work. i linked my jquery file in my html document and im using jquery's cdn
[08:46:41] <decx> use a class adv_
[08:46:48] <adv_> decx: hm?
[08:47:00] <decx> h
[08:47:00] <decx> hm
[08:47:04] <decx> how do i explain that
[08:47:08] <decx> oh i know, use a class
[08:47:10] <gambl0re> what class adv_?
[08:47:22] <adv_> lol
[08:47:31] <adv_> what do you mean by class
[08:47:41] <decx> let me draw a picture
[08:48:18] <pacMakaveli> Hey guys, does anyone know how would one extract everything from this string but the content between the brackets? [foo] bar .. I only want bar
[08:48:30] <pacMakaveli> I have this so far, match(/\[(.*?)\]/) , but it only gives me the contents of the brackets
[08:49:29] <samssh> pacMakaveli, Is there only one set of brackets, and is it always at the start?
[08:49:37] <pacMakaveli> Yes
[08:49:46] <pacMakaveli> No exceptions :)
[08:50:01] <decx> adv_ http://jsfiddle.net/dgkmL4oc/
[08:50:36] <samssh> Something like this: match(/\[.*\](.*)/)
[08:51:39] <robertmaxrees> pacMakaveli why not .split(']')[1] ?
[08:51:45] <robertmaxrees> if you want to cheat, that is ;)
[08:51:59] <samssh> robertmaxrees, I like it
[08:53:36] <pacMakaveli> samssh: that worked beautifully! Thank you
[08:53:58] <pacMakaveli> robertmaxrees: because I didn't think about it :) I just tried your suggestion and it's much easier.. thank you as well
[08:54:05] * samssh notes small boost to his ego.
[08:54:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:54:31] <pauled> trying to fadeIn() on elem.text("Time out!");
[08:54:33] <giulini> callumacrae: ok
[08:54:44] <pauled> elem.text("Time out!").fadeIn( "slow" ); doesn't work
[08:55:02] <rindolf> samssh: you want match(/\[[^\]]*\](.*/) or use .*?
[08:55:06] <robertmaxrees> pauled what happens instead?
[08:55:27] <pauled> it show timeout without fadin
[08:56:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f8kjoa77/
[08:56:49] <robertmaxrees> pauled you need to make sure the element is display: none; or otherwise hidden first.
[08:56:55] <pauled> robertmaxrees: thanks. I will retry
[08:57:25] <adv_> decx: ah. i was thinking of animate()
[08:57:47] <decx> it's a hammer alright
[08:57:58] <samssh> rindolf, That's also a good answer, but \[.*\] also matched his requirements. (One set of brackets, always at the start)
[08:57:58] <decx> but a class will do just fine if you know your values
[09:02:02] <pauled> robertmaxrees: do you see fadIn here? http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/kccwr3a3/
[09:02:24] <adv_> decx: it's a bit more complicated than this, if i click the enlarged it needs to go back to the original. clicking toggles between big and small
[09:02:34] <robertmaxrees> nope, because you're not setting display: none; on the element before you run that code, PaulCape_
[09:02:36] <robertmaxrees> err, pauled
[09:03:10] <robertmaxrees> pauled http://fiddle.jshell.net/kccwr3a3/1/
[09:03:18] <pauled> thanks
[09:03:25] <robertmaxrees> see the difference?
[09:04:49] <pauled> wow it's magic
[09:04:56] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[09:04:59] <robertmaxrees> i added .hide()
[09:05:02] <robertmaxrees> that's all you needed.
[09:05:38] <decx> well adv_ i dont see how that complicates things?
[09:06:15] <adv_> decx: so easein on the original class as well ?
[09:06:27] <pauled> thank you too much robertmaxrees
[09:07:49] <decx> well i dont know what you are doing, i just assumed it''s like a transforming modal
[09:08:10] <robertmaxrees> pauled that's why i kept saying you needed to hide it first.
[09:08:48] <pauled> yeah true, I didn't saw the css in your first fiddle

[09:31:51] <hrusti> does anyone know for fancy raffle jquery plugin with 100+ slots?
[09:32:10] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:33:05] <decx> mom i code one
[09:33:09] <decx> Math.random()*100 | 0
[09:33:11] <decx> done
[09:33:18] <arc_> ;/
[09:34:15] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[09:35:17] <hrusti> decx: :)
[09:35:21] <Uhkis> but thats not 100+ !
[09:35:30] <robertmaxrees>  Math.random()*101 | 0
[09:35:32] <robertmaxrees> there.
[09:35:49] <Uhkis> so much better plugin!
[09:35:56] <decx> Math.random()*9.33262154e157 | 0 ?
[09:36:16] <robertmaxrees> lel
[09:36:33] <Uhkis> 4
[09:36:45] <Uhkis> chosen by a fair dice roll
[09:36:50] <hrusti> idk if you are serious but I was talking for 100 people
[09:37:09] <hrusti> I need plugin with fancy animation
[09:37:41] <decx> what like a twitch chat raffle
[09:37:42] <hrusti> Math.random()*100 | 0 is great but animation could be better :)
[09:38:37] <hrusti> decx: like rulette
[09:38:51] <arc_> roulette isn't a raffle : /
[09:39:29] <hrusti> but rulette isnt good good because I want spinner for unlimited people
[09:39:38] <hrusti> -good :)
[09:40:00] <hrusti> decx: Idk what twitch chat raffle is, sec. I ll take a look
[09:41:02] <hrusti> decx: lol
[09:44:31] <hrusti> srsly anyone?
[09:45:11] <decx> i dont get it
[09:45:14] <decx> so no ^^
[09:45:50] <robertmaxrees> hrusti what do you need?
[09:45:55] <robertmaxrees> your description didn't make sense
[09:46:18] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: yeah my english is bad :)
[09:46:27] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: something like rulette
[09:46:41] <hrusti> for raffle
[09:47:19] <decx> use the random and do the rest by hand?
[09:47:35] <hrusti> so plugin with jquery animation for random picking person
[09:47:43] <hrusti> from 100+ people
[09:47:46] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/egvj54bk/
[09:48:26] <hrusti> decx: yeah, but I need some fancy sh**
[09:48:29] <hrusti> :)
[09:48:36] <decx> that's up to your css skills
[09:48:49] <hrusti> which suxs
[09:48:57] <hrusti> thats why I am asking for plugin :)
[09:49:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:49:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm still lost - what do roulette and a raffle have to do with one another.
[09:50:04] <randomguy1> seems like something like that would be more of a gadget rather than a plugin.  kinda a narrow use case
[09:50:24] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for something that looks like a roulette wheel that chooses one of a bunch of people?
[09:51:27] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: yes
[09:51:38] <hrusti> but it doesnt have to be roulette like
[09:52:15] <hrusti> needs to look fancy :)
[09:52:42] <robertmaxrees> so you really just need a way to choose a random user with some visual flair?
[09:53:12] <hrusti> yes
[09:55:33] <robertmaxrees> make a grid of the choices, highlight a random one using a recursive timeout that progressively gets slower.
[09:55:37] <converge> is there a way to get a checked radio button ? https://gist.github.com/converge/4e66816498b5c32d3555
[09:56:34] <arc_> converge do you mean selected by default
[09:56:57] <converge> arc_: no.. I want to know, what radio input field the user selected
[09:57:10] <robertmaxrees> a few ways, converge
[09:57:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c3ndpLh4/
[09:58:14] <converge> what I mean is, when the user select some radio button, I want to show a div for example
[09:58:23] <robertmaxrees> right ^ look at the fiddle.
[09:58:34] <robertmaxrees> it shows you how to get info about the one you chose.
[09:59:11] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: you mean something like this: http://www.bennadel.com/resources/presentations/jquery/raffle.htm
[09:59:25] <converge> robertmaxrees: perfect! thanks!!
[09:59:32] <robertmaxrees> hrusti sure, something like that could work.
[10:00:02] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: but I have 100+ users
[10:00:11] <robertmaxrees> hrusti grats?
[10:00:36] <robertmaxrees> that's why i suggest randomly choosing one on the board with a recursive timeout that progressively gets slower.
[10:01:09] <hrusti> lol
[10:01:23] <robertmaxrees> instead of stepping through each one in sequence like that.
[10:02:13] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: hm
[10:02:14] <hrusti> ok
[10:02:22] <robertmaxrees> what?
[10:02:42] <zlude> Hello! I'm showing data from my database as json, to get using ajax, can I do something to just my application can access this json? just my application can see the content, this is possible?
[10:02:49] <arc_> it seems like a better idea would be to have a spinning motion animation that is not legible and then it stops on the randomly selected username
[10:03:11] <robertmaxrees> zlude CORS
[10:03:21] <robertmaxrees> use CORS restrictions to limit the URLs that can access.
[10:03:40] <robertmaxrees> you should also look at filtering requests based on referrers and authentication.
[10:03:56] <hrusti> arc_: yeah good idea
[10:04:03] <hrusti> I was thinking about this slot

[11:00:36] <rindolf> k-joseph: can you post a reproducing example to jsfiddle/etc.?
[11:01:44] <rindolf> k-joseph: what you're describing sounds strange.

[11:21:36] <rindolf> k-joseph: you're creating a new DOM element in the .html ( ... ) thing. It may not have the same event handlers.
[11:22:20] <rindolf> k-joseph: like the link here says  - http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:22:28] <rindolf> k-joseph: someone else gave it here.
[11:22:52] <k-joseph> rindolf: it seems to work on jsFiddle but fails on my computer, i think that's the reason, i have looked into that but seems not to get it straight
[11:23:14] <k-joseph> rindolf: re-visiting it
[11:23:27] <rindolf> k-joseph: are you using a local HTTP service?
[11:23:45] <rindolf> k-joseph: or are you viewing a file on the disk directly? (with a file:/// URL)
[11:24:16] <k-joseph> rindolf: running from a local web server
[11:28:20] <rindolf> k-joseph: ah.
[11:41:10] <pauled> any idea how to pause the console before some element are dynamically changed?
[11:41:35] <pauled> I mean for the dom inspector

[11:51:17] <rindolf> k-joseph: let me see.
[11:51:40] <rindolf> backintown: I'm solving exercises from the book "Book of Proof".
[11:52:22] <backintown> whats that about
[11:52:43] <rindolf> k-joseph: what's the problem with that?
[11:53:10] <rindolf> backintown: http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/index.html - about writing mathematical proofs.
[11:53:10] <k-joseph> rindolf: can you point me to an example that used http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:54:30] <rindolf> k-joseph: thing is if you replace the element with a new one, it may not preserve its handlers.
[11:55:03] <k-joseph> rindolf: how about if you append to it?
[11:55:06] <rindolf> k-joseph: you can try running the binding again wehn it changes.
[11:55:14] <WigglesMcMuffin> Hey all, quick question. I'm doing work on something connecting to celery, and I need to put together the system to monitor the status of the jobs. I considered a setInterval with a forall <lil> in <table> check status loop, but I wasn't sure. The REST api can be rewritten. I can't do sockets unfortunately. Thoughts or suggestions for improvements?
[11:55:26] <rindolf> k-joseph: I think appending or replacing content should be fine in this respect.
[11:56:20] <k-joseph> rindolf: though i still need one where it is not appended but rather rewritten with same class
[11:56:35] <backintown> Rindolf: get outside of the box
[11:57:05] <rindolf> backintown: pardon?
[11:57:25] <backintown> the box. step outside of it.
[11:57:36] <rindolf> backintown: which box?
[11:57:49] <backintown> all of them
[11:58:55] <rindolf> backintown: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-perl-thinking-outside-the-box
[11:59:11] <rindolf> (Note : it's a link to my home page).
[11:59:23] <rindolf> Well, a link to a page on my web site.
[11:59:37] <backintown> your israeli?
[11:59:56] <backintown> thats fucking fascinating
[12:00:21] <backintown> you know the one thing this page is missing
[12:00:34] <rindolf> k-joseph: you can change the classes without overwriting the element.
[12:00:40] <backintown> some Matisyahu laying down some fucking tracks
[12:01:04] <rindolf> k-joseph: I think the functions for that are addClass / removeClass / etc.
[12:01:20] <rindolf> backintown: I am Israeli, yes.
[12:02:27] <WigglesMcMuffin> Anyone? Was hoping maybe there was a paradigm I'd overlooked, or a library I'd forgotten about?
[12:02:53] <k-joseph> rindolf: am often times updating contents of divs from the server, i need the new content to use same class so that the functionality attached to the previous content can be used on the new
[12:03:23] <rindolf> WigglesMcMuffin: what exactly is the dilemma?
[12:04:22] <backintown> rindolf can I call you rindalf because its more like gandalf and its just easier for me personally?
[12:04:26] <rindolf> k-joseph: OK, then you can do something like function bind_stuff() { $(".foo").click( ... ) } and call it again.
[12:04:44] <rindolf> backintown: I don't get highlighted on "rindalf".
[12:04:53] <rindolf> backintown: don't  you have tab-completion?
[12:04:54] <robertmaxrees> k-joseph why not use event delegation?
[12:05:00] <WigglesMcMuffin> So I have a set of tasks that will be visible in a dashboard, and I want to keep track of their status (running, success, failure). I didn't know the best, most efficient way to keep track of those
[12:05:31] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: am still having some bug http://jsfiddle.net/4aja7f07/3/
[12:05:44] <WigglesMcMuffin> Currently I was looking at doing a foreach loop in a setInterval to call for each of the statuses every 20/30 seconds, but I get the impression there may be a smarter way to do it?
[12:05:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use delegation, k-joseph
[12:05:57] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: rindolf, correcting the second Re-Writing div-id link
[12:06:03] <rindolf> WigglesMcMuffin: using AJAX?
[12:06:09] <backintown> wtf does this mean .cbp-contentslider .icon-wolf:before {
[12:06:09] <backintown>  content: "\56";
[12:06:10] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: correction please
[12:06:12] <backintown> whatisthat content bullshit?
[12:06:13] <WigglesMcMuffin> rindolf: Yeah
[12:06:29] <rindolf> WigglesMcMuffin: I see.
[12:06:34] <robertmaxrees> k-joseph .on() supercedes .delegate(), and the target needs to be a parent element that exists at the time of binding.
[12:06:38] <robertmaxrees> it can't be the element itsel.f
[12:06:57] <rindolf> WigglesMcMuffin: will it be one AJAX call every 20 or 30 seconds?
[12:07:11] <robertmaxrees> k-joseph http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4aja7f07/4/ here's an example.
[12:07:13] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: an example, preferably dealing with mine
[12:07:25] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: checking
[12:07:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events does a good job of explaining it.
[12:07:33] <WigglesMcMuffin> I control the api, so I can rewrite them, I could in theory do a /api/all_statuses, but that still intrinsically has the ask for everything and iterate through, or a /status/task_id which is *way* more ajax calls, but at least they're in order so less sorting logic
[12:07:43] <robertmaxrees> k-joseph as does http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:07:55] <rindolf> WigglesMcMuffin: ah.
[12:08:30] <WigglesMcMuffin> I would've preferred to just do websockets, and right status change events through them, but that's not doable
[12:09:49] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: correct, thanks and rindolf
[12:27:37] <Talow> http://jsfiddle.net/saajdgsx/4/ I first off want to be able to drag the ul.user-list li elements to the ul.tables.li elements and drop them there. However I can't even figure out how to get them to drag in the first place.
[12:28:10] <Talow> seems I forgot 2 things in the js on this one second
[12:28:38] <Talow> http://jsfiddle.net/saajdgsx/6/
[12:35:45] <robertmaxrees> Talow http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/saajdgsx/8/
[12:36:12] <rindolf> Talow: from what I see here - it is jQuery UI - not jQuery alone - http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[12:36:15] <robertmaxrees> jqueryui for the edge version of jquery seems busted.
[12:36:31] <robertmaxrees> rindolf they have jquery ui selected.
[12:36:37] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: ah.
[12:36:42] <Talow> oh, so it was just the one I selected :(
[12:36:46] <robertmaxrees> Talow also, you have a syntax error.
[12:36:47] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: I only see jQuery (edge) there.
[12:36:57] <robertmaxrees> rindolf look at the checkboxes right below it.
[12:37:03] <robertmaxrees> Talow (function($) { isn't waht you want in this case, either.
[12:37:06] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: ah, I see - sorry.
[12:37:25] <robertmaxrees> Talow since you're running this as "No wrap - in <head>"
[12:37:52] <Talow> that was me just trying different ways of doing it
[12:37:59] <Talow> trying to get it functioning
[12:38:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/saajdgsx/9/
[12:39:16] <Talow> http://jsfiddle.net/saajdgsx/10/
[12:39:38] <Talow> it should be with onload I beleive.
[12:39:41] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:39:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not an onload function.
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> that's an IIFE
[12:40:01] <Talow> o.o?
[12:41:36] <robertmaxrees> !g iife
[12:41:36] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) → http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[12:41:36] <robertmaxrees> that just protects the $ variable.
[12:41:36] <Talow> ah.
[12:41:36] <Talow> I'll have to check some other things but that's good info none the less.
[12:41:36] <robertmaxrees> you really want $(function() {});
[12:41:39] <Talow> more like drupal won't like me if it's not there from what I've seen.
[12:41:40] <Talow> x.x
[12:42:46] <Talow> you're right of corse
[12:42:52] <Talow> I double checked with drupal
[12:42:54] <Talow> x.x
[12:42:59] <Talow> I'm just too noob with this
[12:43:06] <robertmaxrees> you really want jQuery(function($) { /* your code here */ });
[12:43:37] <robertmaxrees> that'll protect your $ variable AND give you a document ready all in one.
[12:43:55] * Talow nods
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> you could also wrap everything in (function($) {/* your code here */}(jQuery)) and then proceed as per usual.
[12:45:12] <Talow> but that would make $ have the extra features
[12:45:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:45:47] <Talow> add the functions to $ not just have them be my functions
[12:45:58] <Talow> is that right?
[12:45:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:46:05] <Talow> ah
[12:46:08] <robertmaxrees> one sec and i'll explain.
[12:46:11] <Talow> I'm confusing myself I think
[12:46:39] * Talow wishes javascript could be more direct and less forgiving like c#
[12:47:09] <robertmaxrees> it IS direct, you just have to play by its rules ;)
[12:47:53] <Talow> I like my rules
[12:47:57] <Talow> lol
[12:49:10] <robertmaxrees> here's the story - (function() {}()) - this is an IIFE. it's a single-use scope that gets run immediately.
[12:49:49] <robertmaxrees> when you do (function($) {}(jQuery)), you get a scope that basically "maps" $ to jQuery, so you can safely use $ if noconflict/another library stomped over it.
[12:50:06] <robertmaxrees> (this is grossly oversimplified, but it'll help you wrap your head around things)
[12:50:31] <robertmaxrees> IIFEs run whenever you define them - they're not like document ready in that regard.
[12:52:27] <Talow> (function($) {})(jQuery); is the one drupal makes use of.
[12:52:41] <Talow> I've not seen them use the other at this point.
[12:52:50] <robertmaxrees> drupal needs that because it's probably got jquery in noConflict mode.
[12:53:04] <robertmaxrees> so you can safely use $(document).ready() or just $(function() {});
[12:53:21] <Talow> that makes sence
[12:54:11] <limpc> hi guys, I have <a class='someclass'>sometext</a>, with a click bind in jquery. when a user clicks on it, i perform an action then change the text on the link via $(this).html('new link text');  the click bind seems to no longer function after that.  why?
[12:54:28] <robertmaxrees> limpc because you've already changed the text?
[12:54:39] <limpc> the bind is on the class not the text
[12:54:49] <limpc> its supposed to fire an ajax call..
[12:54:51] <robertmaxrees> show us an example in a fiddle.
[12:54:54] <robertmaxrees> ah wait
[12:54:54] <limpc> the firing does not occur
[12:55:09] <robertmaxrees> is the a tag apart of an area that gets replaced by the ajax?
[12:55:14] <limpc> no
[12:55:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then i'd need to see an example, even if it's non-functioning
[12:59:29] <PeraPeric> i'm using twitter typeahead.js
[13:00:00] <PeraPeric> i'm using twitter typeahead.js and multiple datasets. how can I get name of the dataset on selected event?
[13:00:06] <limpc> robertmaxrees, hmm i made it in the jsfiddle and it works fine there.  so something else in my code is blocking subsequent calls.
[13:00:28] <robertmaxrees> limpc interesting.  check your console and network tab.  i wonder if you have something else going on maybe?
[13:00:50] <limpc> well thats the problem. im using console. i see the first ajax fire and a successful response.
[13:01:01] <limpc> but clicking the link again, nothing happens. its like the bind was removed
[13:01:44] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you pop a console log in there?>
[13:05:17] <Talow> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/saajdgsx/11/
[13:05:36] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[13:06:21] <Talow> me not understanding scope yet
[13:06:26] <Talow> trying to learn it from that
[13:06:28] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[13:06:39] <Talow> oh sorry how do I get the clicked li element there
[13:07:07] <robertmaxrees> the 'this' object will be the clicked li.  $(this) will be the jquery object version.
[13:07:15] <robertmaxrees> also: there's a slightly better way to do this.
[13:07:27] <Talow> $(this) is the function clicked I thought
[13:08:24] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/ explains that your 'this' object is set to the element in this case.
[13:08:32] <robertmaxrees> 'this' is not the function itself, either way.
[13:09:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/saajdgsx/12/ is even better
[13:10:24] <David44357> I have an incredibly stupid question if anyone has a minute to help a noobie
[13:10:33] <robertmaxrees> David44357 don't ask to ask.  just ask.
[13:10:55] <David44357> Trying to add Jquery UI to a C# web application in Visual Studio for basic Dialog boxes
[13:11:19] <David44357> But I don't know how to add the Jquery UI scripts to my app.
[13:11:28] <robertmaxrees> how did you add jquery?
[13:11:54] <David44357> Clicked on the Scripts folder, then went to Project, Add Existing Item, Selected all nad clicked add
[13:12:00] <David44357> the files are now located under Scripts
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> for jquery you only need one file.
[13:12:21] <robertmaxrees> for jquery ui, you need the library and the css file for it.
[13:12:46] <robertmaxrees> so make sure you're only loading a single copy of jquery for starters.
[13:13:01] <David44357> huh, I downloaded Jquery UI 1.11.4 and it included a bunch of css files, an images folder, etc.
[13:13:10] <NonSecwitter> I normally program in C++, but I have to debug a website that our company uses. Can someone help me figure out what jquery.jqGrid('getDataIDs') is doing?
[13:13:35] <robertmaxrees> David44357 for jQuery UI, you need to include jQuery, and then something like jquery-ui.min.js and jquery-ui.min.css
[13:13:50] <robertmaxrees> NonSecwitter that's running a plugin.
[13:14:03] <robertmaxrees> NonSecwitter http://www.trirand.com/blog/
[13:14:05] <Talow> robertmaxrees this does what I expect but is there a better way?
[13:14:13] <robertmaxrees> Talow did you see what i showed you?'
[13:14:16] <David44357> This is what I put in the Master file, which has the Head tag
[13:14:17] <David44357> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/Scripts/jquery-ui.css">
[13:14:17] <David44357>   <script src="/Scripts/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>
[13:14:17] <David44357>   <script src="/Scripts/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[13:14:25] <NonSecwitter> I can tell from the source that it is iterating over some set of rows. Are those the rows in the table that is calling the function?
[13:14:29] <robertmaxrees> David44357 please don't paste in the channel.
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> and that should work.
[13:14:48] <Talow> Yes I did
[13:14:49] <robertmaxrees> NonSecwitter you'd have to read the docs on the jqGrid site to uynderstand what's going on.
[13:15:15] <David44357> kk, but it just creates text, rather than a dialog box
[13:15:25] <robertmaxrees> David44357 try including one of the "theme" files.
[13:15:39] <NonSecwitter> robertmaxrees: That blog doesn't have any documentation.. I haven't been able to find any good documentation TBH
[13:15:46] <Talow> robertmaxrees sorry I didn't paste the update I did. http://jsfiddle.net/saajdgsx/13/
[13:15:49] <robertmaxrees> http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:jqgriddocs NonSecwitter
[13:16:06] <NonSecwitter> Just found that, too. Thanks
[13:16:19] <robertmaxrees> Talow start by not using super shortened variable names.
[13:16:29] <robertmaxrees> var $tableItems = $('.table-items'); etc.
[13:16:33] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go to lunch.
[13:16:36] <robertmaxrees> be back later.
[13:27:48] <backintown> rindalf i never got a clarification that certain matter
[13:30:35] <PeraPeric> i'm using twitter typeahead.js and multiple datasets. how can I get name of the dataset on selected event?
[13:41:31] <rindolf> backintown: what?
[13:42:50] <rubyonrailed> How can I append a table row to a table row?  I can append a row to the tbody, but If I try to append to a row, it breaks.
[13:43:28] <rindolf> rubyonrailed: can you use .after() or whatever it is called?
[13:43:47] <rindolf> rubyonrailed: or maybe .html() and do <tr> .. </tr><tr> .. </tr>
[13:44:07] <rubyonrailed> rindolf: Thanks .after() seems to do the trick.
[13:44:30] <rindolf> rubyonrailed: you're welcome .
[13:50:39] <evilnebby> http://pastebin.com/csj3aT6a Right now I'm using randomly generated IDs, but in case I'm missing something obvious…
[14:00:33] <jQuery401> Hello, I want to know how can I reopen my dialog
[14:01:29] <jQuery401> I was searching but doesn't work me this: $(this).dialog('destroy').remove();
[15:08:58] <CorporateM> Hrm, does anyone have a minute to help me get Jscript UI working? I've added jquery-ui and jquery 1.10.2.js, as well as jquery-ui.css, but I still can't get Dialog working
[15:34:50] <converge> my ajax calls are always returning error in this specific server, what could I check ?
[15:40:33] <tasaif> converge: the error code and messages
[15:40:38] <tasaif> and the resulting data
[15:41:09] <converge> tasaif: it's a login screen, it's loggin, but showing the error message
[15:42:10] <tasaif> what's the error message?
[16:13:16] <CorporateM> Still unable to get Jquery Dialog boxes to work if anyone has a minute to help. I've watched lots of tutorials, but they all seem to suggest it should work
[16:13:28] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[16:13:38] <robertmaxrees> or an example of your code up somewhere?
[16:13:46] <CorporateM> hey robert!
[16:14:02] <CorporateM> we were talking earlier, and I ran off to research more and see if I could get it working, but still stuck
[16:14:08] <CorporateM> David44357
[16:14:17] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[16:14:52] <CorporateM> question, do I need a script source specifically for the Dialog box? as oppose to jquery-ui?
[16:15:08] <CorporateM> one of the stack overflow strings I read said so, but the link they provided was broken
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> for the dialogue widget?  you just need jquery and jquery ui
[16:15:18] <robertmaxrees> that's it.
[16:15:34] <CorporateM> kk, yah how should i share the code since i'm not suppose to paste it here
[16:15:39] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.
[16:16:29] <CorporateM> Oh, lol I thought you were mocking me (you know, a fiddle like the violin that plays when ppl whine). I spend too much time on Wikipedia where people are snarky
[16:16:34] <CorporateM> one sec, I'll look it up
[16:16:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:20:06] <CorporateM> here we go https://jsfiddle.net/3bcfjj9u/
[16:20:32] <CorporateM> I've done it a dozen different ways - that's the code I've used from the latest tutorial I watched
[16:21:19] <robertmaxrees> you realize that's not how you use jsfiddle, right?
[16:21:33] <robertmaxrees> and part of your problem is you're loading jquery more than once.
[16:21:37] <CorporateM> no, never heard of it before until just now
[16:22:35] <robertmaxrees> and your JS isn't complete.
[16:22:42] <CorporateM> I just started learning C# last week - this is my first app; it's almost done, but the Javascript alerts are ugly and they change the entire page's font size for some reason
[16:22:54] <robertmaxrees> your JS isn't even valid.
[16:23:11] <robertmaxrees> one sec i'
[16:23:15] <robertmaxrees> *i'll show you
[16:23:40] <CorporateM> argh, it's almost an exact duplicate of the tutorial I watched
[16:23:51] <robertmaxrees> you're missing closing brackets and parents.
[16:23:54] <robertmaxrees> *parens
[16:24:52] <CorporateM> Hey I said my question was stupid ;-)
[16:25:09] <robertmaxrees> so you don't really know JS, right?
[16:25:13] <robertmaxrees> why not take the time to actually learnit.
[16:25:30] <CorporateM> I will be - I just started on C# last week
[16:25:50] <robertmaxrees> err, right.
[16:25:53] <CorporateM> Everything I read said C# didn't have any good comment boxes like this
[16:25:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:26:02] <robertmaxrees> because C# doesn't do client-side
[16:26:22] <robertmaxrees> so $(function() { and $(document).ready(function() { mean the same thing.
[16:26:30] <robertmaxrees> the former is a shortcut to the latter.
[16:26:55] <CorporateM> got it
[16:27:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3bcfjj9u/1/
[16:27:53] <robertmaxrees> this is what you were working towards, even though it's broken.
[16:28:34] <CorporateM> that's actually closer to the original tutorial from the Dialog website
[16:29:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/dialog/ fwiw ;0
[16:29:22] <CorporateM> yup that one
[16:29:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3bcfjj9u/2/ this is really what you want.
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> as far as the js and css is concerned, you only need jquery, jquery-ui, and the jquery-ui css.
[16:30:58] <robertmaxrees> click "view source" on this example https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#animated
[16:36:36] <CorporateM> Ok, so I'm reviewing why yours works and mine doesn't - as soon as I add   <script type="text/javascript">, mine stops working
[16:36:43] <CorporateM> in js fiddle
[16:36:50] <robertmaxrees> don't use that.
[16:36:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid in jsfiddle.
[16:37:27] <CorporateM> but I need to use it on my app right
[16:37:38] <robertmaxrees> right.  just not on jsfiddle.
[16:37:47] <robertmaxrees> everything in the script section is placed into a script tag for you.
[16:38:51] <CorporateM> kk Thanks! it works in js fiddle, but not in my app
[16:39:10] <robertmaxrees> did you remove the extra js you've got?
[16:39:16] <CorporateM> going to see if i can verify the script sources
[16:39:23] <CorporateM> yah, one sec
[16:40:12] <CorporateM> this is what i've got
[16:40:13] <CorporateM> https://jsfiddle.net/0uxkfwt5/
[16:40:29] <robertmaxrees> copy/paste the page into a fixee.
[16:40:35] <robertmaxrees> the whole page - http://fixee.org/home/
[16:40:45] <CorporateM> but i think those urls are wrong
[16:40:56] <robertmaxrees> show me the whole page.
[16:41:22] <CorporateM> the whole app is here: http://buildadeck.azurewebsites.net/
[16:41:41] <CorporateM> The code is spread out over a couple different pages, the Site.Master page and the Default.aspx page
[16:42:36] <robertmaxrees> i don't see jquery ui included here.
[16:43:54] <CorporateM> I think the URLs are wrong, every tutorial has different urls and different version numbers
[16:44:02] <CorporateM> for the script source includes
[16:44:05] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:44:09] <robertmaxrees> your app does not include jquery ui.
[16:44:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure how else to phrase that.
[16:44:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix that part first.
[16:45:04] <robertmaxrees> and the versioning thing is complicated.
[16:45:39] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/ps6t5jx/ this is more in line with the basics of what you want.
[16:45:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd really suggest reading http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/
[16:46:07] <robertmaxrees> and reading some other javascript tutorials.
[16:46:58] <CorporateM> oh my bad, I linked to the live online version, which was published before I even started trying to add jscript
[16:47:56] <robertmaxrees> gotta walk before you can run.
[16:48:17] <CorporateM> Yah, I have a couple books in the mail on SQL and Javascript
[16:48:31] <CorporateM> I would think this is more like walking but apparently not ;-)
[16:48:40] <robertmaxrees> heh, you don't even know javascript basics.
[16:48:59] <robertmaxrees> need to understand the basics of a document and how it works, events, etc.
[16:50:53] <CorporateM> the code is apparently fine, since it works in js.fiddle, but it doesn't work on my app, so I think it's something else, I'll keep hammering away at it
[16:52:14] <CorporateM> Thanks for your patience and help!

[17:23:05] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete.
[17:24:14] <robertmaxrees> you're telling it to "fade in" but it's already visible.

[18:55:16] <printForever> guys, I'm in a pickle right now
[18:55:26] <printForever> I'm using YSlow and I cant find the bloody inline <style> tag #1 location
[18:55:38] <printForever> what does "inline <style> tag #1" mean?
[18:57:23] <Cork> printForever: i would guess that you have a <style> in a dynamically loaded html blob
[18:57:40] <printForever> but what does tag #1 mean?
[18:57:45] <printForever> its not a line number
[18:57:49] <printForever> so I cant find it
[18:58:01] <printForever> there isn't any ID to it, or anything that would help me locate it
[18:58:08] <Cork> if it is dynamically loaded, it could be
[18:58:25] <printForever> inline <script> tag #1
[18:58:25] <printForever> inline <script> tag #10
[18:58:37] <printForever> why not inline <script> tag #2
[18:58:38] <Cork> as line references gets messed up in those cases
[18:58:40] <printForever> why 10?
[18:58:46] <printForever> :/
[19:19:58] <kapena> Hello would someone please be so kind to help me here with understanding why this logic is a bit wonky
[19:20:18] <kapena> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30471572/not-able-to-get-my-if-else-statement-logic-to-work/30471641?noredirect=1#comment49024064_30471641
[19:21:41] <acidjazz> whichi logic
[19:22:17] <kapena> Well I wrote the stackover flow post..The logic in my if statement
[19:23:01] <kapena> if else logic is not really working..getting the images to fade out but they are not fading out one by one fading out all at once
[19:27:53] <acidjazz> are you using js to fade out image?
[19:27:55] <acidjazz> images*
[19:28:00] <acidjazz> how so? like have them disappear?
[19:28:12] <kapena> jquery
[19:28:35] <acidjazz> are you brent or marco
[19:28:36] <kapena> here is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/kapena/v82pvq7x/1/
[19:28:49] <kapena> brent
[19:29:00] <acidjazz> i think you 1st need to simplify that statement
[19:29:26] <kapena> Yes I think so to
[19:29:42] <sammych> alrighty, I am fairly certain that a recent Chrome update broke a 1.3.2 app of mine
[19:29:43] <kapena> Just a bit hung up on how to
[19:29:43] <acidjazz> also i would put the transitions as classes
[19:29:49] <acidjazz> and use .addClass and .removeClass
[19:29:55] <acidjazz> using the javscript fades makes it framey
[19:30:13] <sammych> closing a popup isn't doing everything it should be
[19:30:16] <kapena> ok so transitions as css classes
[19:30:21] <acidjazz> so like carousle li.off { opacity: 0; transition opacity 0.2s linear; }
[19:30:25] <sammych> such as properly updating classes on the body
[19:30:32] <acidjazz> then li.on { opacity: 1; }
[19:30:39] <acidjazz> transition: opacity 0.2s linear;
[19:30:43] <acidjazz> then you just swap .on and .off
[19:31:15] <sammych> changing a page and attempting to open a popup on that page, will make the previous page 'active'
[19:31:41] <acidjazz> what does .eq() do again kapena
[19:31:45] <kapena> yo I am here
[19:31:59] <acidjazz> oh right ok
[19:32:03] <sammych> by 'active', I mean it has the class 'ui-page-active', the page I should be on doesn't have that class anymore, but the page I should be on is still $.mobile.activePage
[19:32:29] <kapena> hold a sec
[19:33:08] <kapena> Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index.
[19:33:22] <kapena> thats what eq dose
[19:33:34] <kapena> https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[19:33:46] <acidjazz> 1min kapena
[19:33:50] <acidjazz> changing fiddle
[19:33:51] <kapena> How would you clean but my logic
[19:33:58] <kapena> thax
[19:34:15] <kapena> up** not but haha
[19:37:00] <acidjazz> you only want to show one image at a time?
[19:38:42] <kapena> yea
[19:38:53] <kapena> one image per click
[19:43:57] <acidjazz> ok
[19:45:29] <acidjazz> sort of liek this kapena http://jsfiddle.net/v82pvq7x/3/
[19:45:31] <acidjazz> but theres a bug
[19:45:39] <kapena> do you have an example acidjazz for me to look at
[19:45:46] <acidjazz> gimme 2m
[19:45:51] <kapena> sorry did not see the link
[19:47:24] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/v82pvq7x/4/
[19:47:44] <acidjazz> ah i need to promise.done
[19:49:46] <kapena> Well it still seems to have a bug
[19:49:56] <acidjazz> there we go
[19:49:58] <acidjazz> onesec
[19:50:02] <kapena> I click next link and we get alert
[19:50:11] <kapena> haha thax
[19:50:22] <kapena> I see where you are going with this
[19:50:35] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/v82pvq7x/5/
[19:50:46] <acidjazz> can we make placeholdit make colors
[19:52:05] <kapena> I see!
[19:52:20] <acidjazz> hmm still not feeding
[19:52:22] <acidjazz> fading
[19:52:23] <acidjazz> 1min
[19:52:29] <kapena> So what you are suggesting not to use the fade method
[19:52:33] <kapena> and just use css
[19:53:06] <kapena> you are suggesting to use the css for the fades correct
[19:53:08] <acidjazz> yea you want to always transition in css
[19:53:13] <acidjazz> so it uses the devices GPU
[19:54:03] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/v82pvq7x/6/
[19:54:04] <acidjazz> close
[19:54:30] <acidjazz> oh its your scroll
[19:56:19] <kapena> I just closed it
[19:56:25] <kapena> sorry
[19:56:40] <kapena> so call the fade method but then do the fading in css
[19:56:58] <kapena> Can I open the link again
[19:57:04] <acidjazz> yea still fixing it
[19:57:10] <acidjazz> but see w/ this handler
[19:57:13] <acidjazz> you can pass both prev and newxt
[19:57:17] <acidjazz> and instead of ++ you --
[19:57:56] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/v82pvq7x/7/
[19:57:57] <acidjazz> there
[19:57:59] <acidjazz> hit next
[19:58:44] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/v82pvq7x/8/
[19:58:47] <kapena> cool I am going to give it a shot
[19:58:53] <acidjazz> but see w/ this method, you can bind prev, next, and each page element to this function
[19:59:00] <acidjazz> for page divs you can do data-page="2"
[19:59:23] <acidjazz> then if $(this).data('page') is defined and a number, just change var next to pagenum
[20:00:04] <acidjazz> the 2 major things to practice is combine your handlers where you are able to to minify them, and always keep animations/transitions in css
[20:00:13] <acidjazz> you can even delay like this..
[20:00:22] <kapena> Wow dude
[20:00:32] <kapena> You blew my mind..haha
[20:01:36] <kapena> Can you explain to me what was wrong with my code originally? My logic was all wonky
[20:02:19] <acidjazz> somethign w/ your loop and if check
[20:02:36] <kapena> I think it was funky logic and like you said handlers
[20:02:39] <acidjazz> i didnt really look into it cuz i wanted to show you how yoru handler can be alot more useful than for just 1 button
[20:02:57] <kapena> yeah the loop was all off..
[20:03:13] <acidjazz> here
[20:03:20] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/v82pvq7x/10/
[20:03:24] <acidjazz> giving the .on a delay
[20:05:13] <kapena> So if we wanted to add the prev button then I would mirror your code just use prev instead of next
[20:05:33] <kapena> don't do it for be because I want to do it :)
[20:08:18] <kapena> well there would be a few things to change but I would use your code as a scaffold to help me through
[20:10:50] <kapena> thax so much acid jazz
[20:27:13] <uncovery> hey guys, I am trying to make an element blink red & green for 2 second, won't work for some reason though, any idea whats wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/ams0fat2/3/
[20:52:04] <acidjazz> np kap
[20:52:42] <acidjazz> i would move the css to a class uncovery
[20:52:44] <acidjazz> and use transitions
[20:53:13] <uncovery> actually I am now trying to use jquerUI
[20:53:21] <uncovery> and use effects
[20:53:45] <acidjazz> so uncovery you have a green and red class
[20:53:46] <acidjazz> right
[20:53:59] <acidjazz> .green { background-color: green; }
[20:54:00] <acidjazz> etc
[20:54:05] <uncovery> oh I see
[20:54:08] <acidjazz> then a class for both that has a transition
[20:54:17] <uncovery> I see
[20:54:20] <uncovery> makes sense
[20:54:23] <acidjazz> .blinker { -webkit-transition: background-color 0.2s linear; }
[20:54:39] <acidjazz> when you add/remove the green/red classes youll get a transition effect
[20:54:50] <acidjazz> <div class="blinker green">testing</div>
[20:54:55] <uncovery> so the timing is in the css, not the JS?
[20:54:58] <acidjazz> then use setInterval to swap the two classes
[20:55:05] <acidjazz> yes move timing to CSS and its smoother and less CPU
[20:55:06] <uncovery> ok will try
[20:55:17] <uncovery> thanks a lot
[20:55:19] <acidjazz> in fact you can just use a keyframe
[20:55:47] <acidjazz> @keyframe blink { 0%: { background-color: green; }, 50%: { background-color: red; } }
[20:56:09] <acidjazz> then .blinker { -webkit-animation: blink 1s infinite alternate; }
[20:56:26] <acidjazz> then in JS all you gotta do is swap the blinker class
[20:57:41] <uncovery> ok I will try to figure that out thanks
[20:58:07] <acidjazz> uncovery: http://jsfiddle.net/umz8t/328/
[20:58:19] <acidjazz> uncovery: swap those opacitys to background-colors
[20:58:31] <acidjazz> then just use JS to add/remove the class base on whatever you want
[20:59:19] <uncovery> ah cool thanks
[21:09:23] <acidjazz> man aws isntance to instance is damn fast
[21:17:11] <uncovery> somehow I am too ignorant to do this.... http://jsfiddle.net/umz8t/3208/
[21:20:27] <acidjazz> lets see
[21:20:29] <uncovery> hmm actually on my server it works fine lol
[21:20:38] <uncovery> don't know whats wrong in the fiddle :)
[21:20:51] <acidjazz> if you're just doing 0% and 100%
[21:20:54] <acidjazz> you can use from and to
[21:24:00] <acidjazz> you didnt close a bracket :)
[21:24:51] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/umz8t/3210/
[21:25:04] <acidjazz> you dont need to set a timeout
[21:25:06] <uncovery> oh lol sorry
[21:28:02] <uncovery> I am on firefox but what you did does not do anything here.. and there is a typo in element_id at the function call
[21:28:24] <uncovery> I need to use the -moz... right?
[21:29:52] <uncovery> ah yes thats better
[21:32:29] <uncovery> but I need the timer to take the class away again, no?
[21:32:42] <uncovery> otherwise it cannot be executed 2x or more
[21:34:59] <acidjazz> yea so -moz- worked
[21:35:15] <acidjazz> ideally id use a css preprocessor that takes care of vendors
[21:36:19] <uncovery> I see
[21:36:41] <uncovery> it;s not that sophisticated as an application :)
[22:11:48] <cortexman> i'm using jQuery Debugger https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jquery-debugger/dbhhnnnpaeobfddmlalhnehgclcmjimi
[22:12:06] <cortexman> it shows me the code associated with a click event, but i see no way to copy the code to my clipboard
[23:05:57] <schnoodles> say if i have a click even on an image that is in a div with many of images. Is there an easy way to see what index the image is in ?
[23:07:22] <Cork> schnoodles: first off, bind a delegated event handler to the div instead of the image
[23:07:34] <Cork> that way you only need one handler instead of one per image
[23:07:40] <Cork> secondly .index()
[23:08:19] <schnoodles> You mean like $('img').on('click', 'container', function() {});
[23:09:50] <Cork> opposite
[23:10:01] <Cork> $('container').on('click', 'img', func)
[23:14:45] <schnoodles> Yep thanks I got it working.
[23:54:41] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/gtfpa4oq/ why aren't I getting anything when I check jquery mobile?
