[08:57:18] <halvard> Hello, I am trying to create a autocomplete on two input fields
[08:57:20] <halvard> https://jsfiddle.net/halvardq/8coLrp4d/
[08:57:26] <halvard> I can only get the second one to work
[08:57:35] <halvard> As the variables dont change if I change focus
[15:09:47] <z1haze> any experienced users of the jquery-validation library? I dislike how the library will add the valid class to empty optional fields on submit. I have been looking through the options/settings but i cannot find a method to remove it.. I wrote a function in the submit and focusout handlers that just removes the valid class if its not required and empty, but right after i remove it (when stepping through the debugger) it just gets added back
[15:09:47] <z1haze> again
[15:11:14] <z1haze> actually i figured out why its getting added back.. but wondering if there's an official way to do this without having to roll my own methods
