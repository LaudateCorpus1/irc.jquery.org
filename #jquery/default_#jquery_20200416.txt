[13:55:19] <inthl> is there a way to use the beforeunload event or any other means to call a function which then either decides whether the window.location.href is actually changed - or not ? using beforeunload always results in that `are you sure that you want to leave?`-message. What I want is to decide in my function that the change of the window.location.href may or may not be prohibited.
