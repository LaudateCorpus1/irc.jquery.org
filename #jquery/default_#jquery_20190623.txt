[09:14:42] <M6HZ> Hello
[09:16:28] <M6HZ> I have a simple html file and each time I include the jquery scripts, the alert function doesn't work anymore. Do you know why?
[09:17:45] <M6HZ> Ok, problem solved
[09:32:24] <M6HZ> Actually, no still unsolved.... Do you know what's wrong here: https://pastebin.com/NXhJsd0R ?
[09:47:44] <M6HZ> Alright, I just had to add </script>, my bad.
[10:21:07] <spinningCat> what i missed here https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/1ojn7utk/3/

[14:52:44] <thykka> wtf.. i can't type %)
[14:52:49] <thykka> *what about it, exactly?
[14:53:14] <muhaha> load data from json a do a simple dashboard from tiles
[14:53:48] <thykka> it's not loading data from json..
[14:54:13] <thykka> that's a hard-coded list
[14:56:08] <thykka> and nothing there really requires react nor jQuery, aside perhaps from the randomized colors
[14:57:57] <muhaha> yes, its is, its just for testing
[22:55:36] <hypertiger> https://jsfiddle.net/Lm8ae9yq/
[22:56:05] <hypertiger> when I run script, I get errors on the html page
[22:56:42] <hypertiger> it should get 1:"1" not undefined[object Object]
