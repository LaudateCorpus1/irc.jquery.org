[00:04:40] <guessx> krambal, it will be your css, adding margin-, padding- etc before left/top and having a different background color other than black may help, also adding a border so you can see its all different sizes may also help
[00:05:07] <krambal> ok
[00:07:47] <krambal> guessx is there a way to make it stay in the same spot for the div displaying and show the next div in a different spot ?
[00:09:42] <krambal> nevermind i got it to go
[00:25:09] <Hilton> A few thousand lines later, and I get to a point I'm happy with (barring some more features): https://github.com/hiltonjanfield/jquery.enhsplitter - also on Bower (jquery.enhsplitter), and a Yii2 asset for those who use it (https://github.com/hiltonjanfield/yii2-jquery.enhsplitter)
[00:25:38] <Hilton> And now the wife is yelling at me, so I must got o bed.

[02:16:15] <toomus> Hi all
[02:16:20] <ohcibi> i have a server that takes some time to start up, how could I "wait" for the server to be alive with ajax? i'm thinking of a request to some URL and then in the error-callback re-request until theres no error... is there a better way?
[02:16:48] <strayArch> timeout
[02:17:21] <Cork> ohcibi: you could have a small separate server you could query and have a long timeout
[02:17:28] <Cork> and let it tell you when the server is alive
[02:17:46] <toomus> How to get width of div in pixels which is wider than screen width?
[02:18:04] <ohcibi> .width()?
[02:18:11] <Cork> ya
[02:18:29] <toomus> ohcibi: Nope, this return max screen width
[02:18:33] <ohcibi> oO
[02:18:40] <Cork> toomus: then the element isn't bigger
[02:18:49] <toomus> it is
[02:18:49] <Cork> toomus: note a child can overflow a parent
[02:19:14] <ohcibi> toomus: http://jsfiddle.net/qwdbf3y5/
[02:19:16] <Cork> so most likely what you see is a child that is wider then the screen, and you check a parent that isn't
[02:20:37] <placidb> what would be the best way to remove a previously inserted (using .after()) snippet of HTML?
[02:20:57] <Cork> placidb: .next().remove()
[02:21:05] <placidb> I'm a little confused, because the HTML looks a little like this: </div><div class="row"></div><div>
[02:21:19] <Cork> if you add multiple elements you will have to count the numbers
[02:21:20] <placidb> because I'm breaking up a grid to insert a new row
[02:21:34] <placidb> basically splitting it in half
[02:21:38] <Cork> placidb: you can't add invalid html with after
[02:21:40] <placidb> and I need to glue it back together
[02:21:55] <Cork> so </div> will create an extra div there
[02:22:08] <Cork> and <div> at the end will get closed
[02:22:12] <placidb> alright. thanks for the tip there.
[02:22:25] <placidb> what would be a better way of doing what I described?
[02:22:26] <Cork> placidb: cause the dom is nodes, and can't be "open"
[02:22:50] <Cork> you would have to concut strings if you want to manage unclosed elements
[02:23:01] <Cork> placidb: but best would be to move to working with elements instead
[02:23:30] <placidb> so say I have a column grid that spans a couple of rows
[02:23:44] <placidb> and I need to insert some row somewhere to reveal some details about a certain column
[02:23:50] <placidb> (which is exactly what I need to do)
[02:24:07] <Cork> not sure what you mean by column grid
[02:24:29] <placidb> I mean multiple rows that have multiple cells/columns
[02:24:42] <Cork> well then you need to create the new row
[02:25:38] <placidb> oh actually I said that wrong
[02:25:50] <placidb> it's one row that has a number of cells in them
[02:25:56] <placidb> that wrap on the screen to multiple rows
[02:26:02] <placidb> (using bootstrap 3)
[02:26:30] <placidb> I thought of splitting everything up into separate rows
[02:27:34] <placidb> but I'm using bootstrap's breakpoint classes a lot
[02:27:48] <placidb> and I don't think they would still work
[02:53:58] <wish^> Hi. I am trying to hide and show an overlay on mouseover an image using jquery, it works but if i am hovering on the image and the overlay appears it then hides again because i am now hovering over the new element. How can i fix this?
[04:45:10] <toomus> I need to know total width in pixels of text from textarea. How to do this?
[04:46:45] <toomus> I try to copy textarea value to some div, and then get width of this div.
[04:49:26] <sahbeewah> why do you need to know that
[04:59:34] <toomus> sahbeewah: because I need to know how many lines of text are in textarea
[05:03:11] <CaptainSmoothima> Good morning/noon/evening whatever time zone you are in. I'm trying to figure out why a certain css animation triggers twice in sometimes. The animation call happens in jquery. Page in question http://www.gustav.be/prototype/projects/danish-butter/ When using the controls or arrow keys it never repeats but on mousewheel it sometimes freaks out.
[05:04:54] <sahbeewah> toomus: copy textarea value to a div with the same width as the textarea, then divide resulting div height by line height
[05:06:29] <toomus> sahbeewah: Ah OK :)
[05:26:50] <Fragus> hi guys
[05:27:43] <TripleXero> This chat is a lot more full than I expected
[05:30:20] <TripleXero> Anyways. I've got a question that I'm guessing is kind of stupid and basic, but I can't figure it out. I don't know much about jQurey aside from basics. I'm trying to append something to one td from another td's info without using a loop and getting undefined
[05:31:12] <TripleXero> $("tr:not(:contains('Posted')) td:eq(0)").append( "Posted by " + $(this).parent().find("img").attr("title") ); this is what I have
[05:43:00] <Cork> TripleXero: if possible i strongly recommend to NOT use :contains()
[05:43:29] <Cork> it might look like a good idea, but what jquery does in the background is something you should never do
[05:43:51] <Cork> TripleXero: i recommend adding a class for that info to the element instead
[05:44:59] <Cork> and you can't append a value from a relative element without a loop
[05:45:03] <TripleXero> I did the contains thing because I'm trying to modify a forum that loads new data on scroll and it was re appending things on reload. Is there a better way to avoid that?
[05:45:57] <Cork> $("tr:not(.posted) td:first-child").append(function() { return "Posted by " + $(this).parent().find("img").attr("title"); });
[05:46:06] <Cork> that is about the cleanest you can get
[05:46:52] <Cork> it would require adding a class="posted" to the trs though
[05:50:25] <TripleXero> works pretty well, thank you so much. and its adding the changes to the newly loaded data a ton faster too
[05:51:39] <TripleXero> I only really know html and css pretty well but it seems like jquery has a lot of possibilities and is worth learning so i'm just trying to screw around with it in little projects
[05:54:42] <Cork> TripleXero: ya, i moved it to use native css selectors
[05:54:48] <Cork> and yes that makes it a lot faster
[06:10:35] <Seldon75> on my page I have <input type='submit' id='next-btn' value='Next' />, but when I do: jQuery('#next-btn') it returns: [] - any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[06:11:35] <rollingWolf> Seldon75 I may be remembering wrong now but iirc yuo cant have - in id names? just _
[06:11:46] <rollingWolf> Its been a whiel since ive actually paid attention to selectors ;)
[06:11:47] <Seldon75> ah ok thx
[06:17:19] <Xatenev> rollingWolf: sure you can use - in ID's
[06:17:47] <Xatenev> Seldon75: show the whole code please^^
[06:17:51] <rollingWolf> Xatenev Ah . . It must just be an old habbit why I use _ then :(
[06:18:19] <Xatenev> rollingWolf: the only rule is that you cant start with a number  think
[06:18:30] <Xatenev> for example 3NextBtn
[06:18:49] <Seldon75> sorry it was my own mistake
[06:18:52] <Seldon75> thanks anyway
[06:20:35] <Sal> how do you guys use a popup backdrop div?
[06:20:48] <Sal> do you create on fly before showing the popup?
[06:21:10] <Sal> or do you already have a hidden div in the page and show it before the popup?
[06:21:19] <rollingWolf> Its usually included in whatever im using, be it bootstrap or jquery-ui or whatever
[06:21:26] <rollingWolf> So I dont need to
[06:21:38] <Sal> ot, third, do you prepare the popup alreay with a div wrapper that is the backfrop?
[06:22:45] <Sal> because i tried setting up the popup with a wrapper div as backdrop, but i had problems with the "click-on-backdrop-close" funtion
[06:22:57] <Sal> because everytiume i clicked on the popup, it closed
[06:23:18] <Sal> so now i'm using hidden divs inside the page
[06:23:37] <Sal> but, if i need to show a popup inside another popup, then i have problems
[06:24:46] <Sal> i think that the best way is to prepend a div on the opening popup div giving it a z-index -1 of the popups z-index
[06:24:55] <Sal> then remove it on close
[06:25:01] <Sal> any better ideas?
[06:31:01] <Sal> what happen to real programmers?
[06:31:24] <Sal> this is the problem of today. nobody creates new stuff
[06:31:34] <Sal> they all use frameworks done by others
[06:31:49] <Sal> so we have tons of websote all looking the same
[06:31:54] <Sal> and same features
[06:32:05] <Xatenev> Sal: yea and?
[06:32:37] <Xatenev> Sal: if customer wants a responsive website which looks like X
[06:32:39] <Xatenev> ;)
[06:32:52] <Sal> and, web aint growing with the same speed it used to grow like in back 80s-90s
[06:33:01] <Sal> we are all stuck
[06:33:09] <Xatenev> Sal: we arent
[06:33:23] <Xatenev> all the IT is growing like shit
[06:33:47] <Sal> oh, yes we are if you think that www still doesn't have a real oop language
[06:33:54] <Xatenev> it has
[06:34:01] <Xatenev> multiple
[06:34:13] <Sal> but its still playing around with fck js and all its versions on browsers
[06:34:24] <Sal> no it doesn't
[06:34:33] <Xatenev> lol
[06:34:35] <Xatenev> okay
[06:34:42] <Xatenev> java is oop for me :/
[06:34:46] <Xatenev> c# too
[06:34:55] <Xatenev> PHP nowadays is oop too
[06:34:56] <Xatenev> dunno
[06:35:08] <Sal> ok, never mind
[06:35:21] <mooncup> 15:31 < Sal> this is the problem of today. nobody creates new stuff
[06:35:21] <Sal> i'm talking about a language for html
[06:35:21] <mooncup> 15:31 < Sal> they all use frameworks done by others
[06:35:23] <mooncup> lol
[06:35:27] <mooncup> that's such a stupid statement
[06:35:34] <Xatenev> mooncup: +1
[06:35:45] <Xatenev> A language for HTML?
[06:35:45] <Sal> yes, for today programmers, it is
[06:35:57] <mooncup> so why is it a problem?
[06:36:02] <Sal> i call today programmers, "copy&paste" generation
[06:36:17] <mooncup> usiung a framework is not copy+paste
[06:36:25] <Sal> nobody starts from <html> or from function main()
[06:36:33] <Sal> they all start from google
[06:36:35] <mooncup> some people do
[06:36:41] <mooncup> if you need something new then write it
[06:36:45] <Foxhoundz> Sal: right, because the programmers of yesteryear wrote their own compilers using their own language
[06:36:49] <Foxhoundz> great for job security too
[06:36:55] <mooncup> otherwise if someone has already done it why would you reinvent the wheel?
[06:36:55] <Foxhoundz> everyone writing their own little microframework
[06:37:03] <Foxhoundz> i.e., stuff I have to support now
[06:37:20] <Sal> once, you only had th3e copiler
[06:37:23] <Sal> nothing else
[06:37:26] <Foxhoundz> Sure
[06:37:28] <Sal> no internet to copy from
[06:37:33] <Foxhoundz> but we don't live in the stone age anymore
[06:37:48] <mooncup> 15:37 < Foxhoundz> but we don't live in the stone age anymore
[06:37:49] <Sal> i know, and thats the bad thing for me
[06:37:50] <mooncup> exactly
[06:38:03] <mooncup> would you say that the problem of today is no one grows their own food?
[06:38:03] <Sal> that nobody is putting their brain to create new stuff
[06:38:13] <Foxhoundz> Sal: what do you mean?
[06:38:13] <Sal> and let me say something else
[06:38:23] <Sal> for me, we'tr going back to 80s again
[06:38:27] <Foxhoundz> What does "creating new stuff" entail?
[06:38:30] <Sal> thats to mac developers
[06:38:45] <mooncup> I think to create something new you have to write it in binary Foxhoundz
[06:38:46] <Sal> first they mad a tech war introducing the mouse
[06:38:54] <Sal> now, they all want command line tools
[06:38:57] <Sal> strange
[06:38:59] <mooncup> otherwise you're just using someone else's compiler
[06:39:04] <mooncup> which you just copied from the internet
[06:39:09] <Sal> bower, git, node, etc etc
[06:39:24] <Sal> fucking tools, all command-line that brings us back to dos
[06:39:26] <Foxhoundz> Sal: these tools make it easier maintain code
[06:39:32] <Foxhoundz> they're not necessarily crutches
[06:39:32] <mooncup> loooooool
[06:39:41] <Sal> yes, but they all should be mouse friend-ly
[06:39:42] <mooncup> Sal: command line is just more efficient for a lot of things
[06:39:49] <Xatenev> mooncup: not sure about that
[06:39:54] <Xatenev> I think thats a wrong statement
[06:39:58] <Maitiu> Anyone know of a plugin/library that could help a basic duplication of the Tesla build order form? (http://my.teslamotors.com/models/design)
[06:40:00] <Sal> because if i keep on moving hads from keyboard to mouse, i just loose a lot of time
[06:40:04] <mooncup> Xatenev: so you would say a mouse is more efficient for everything?
[06:40:05] <Xatenev> 1 button is always more effective than writing commands
[06:40:05] <Foxhoundz> Sal: they're command line based becuase they need to be able to be scripted
[06:40:14] <SirLagz> Sal: why would I want to click a whole bunch of buttons when I can script a command to be run automatically
[06:40:15] <Xatenev> I'd say people dont wanna waste their time creating big guis
[06:40:18] <mooncup> Xatenev: ofc it is but how many buttons would you need to replace a shell?
[06:40:23] <Xatenev> for things they can solve by shell easily
[06:40:32] <Foxhoundz> Sal: e.g. in our workplace we have a workflow where automatic syntax checking is done on all incoming code beforing being pushed to our central repo
[06:40:59] <mooncup> point is that it's much easier to type something into a shell than to navigate a huge interface
[06:41:10] <Sal> that could be a server-side script waiting in input
[06:41:14] <Xatenev> mooncup: not if the interface is well designed
[06:41:15] <Xatenev> :P
[06:41:21] <Sal> no need to be controlled on every desktop
[06:41:30] <Sal> anyway, www is not moving
[06:41:34] <SirLagz> Xatenev: can't script a GUI anywhere near as easily as scripting command line utilities though
[06:41:36] <Sal> this is my considerations
[06:41:40] <Xatenev> SirLagz: yeap
[06:41:43] <SirLagz> Sal: so HTML5 is considered not moving?
[06:41:44] <Xatenev> thats why it doesnt exist
[06:41:50] <SirLagz> Xatenev: what doesn't exist?
[06:41:51] <Sal> and, i've been around a lot to say this
[06:42:02] <Xatenev> SirLagz: "a GUI anywhere near as easily as scripting command line utilities"
[06:42:07] <Sal> SirLagz, no, its not moving
[06:42:14] <Xatenev> cause its so hard :P
[06:42:15] <mooncup> Xatenev: even if a complex interface is well designed it still ends up being quicker to type the command 9 times out of 10
[06:42:21] <SirLagz> Xatenev: ah right
[06:42:34] <Xatenev> mooncup: idk actually
[06:42:39] <Sal> adding more tags, or stupid new feautures that could have been done with a real html laguage, is not advancing
[06:42:40] <Foxhoundz> Sal: I think the core thesis of HTMl5, moving the application to the web has largely failed
[06:42:42] <Foxhoundz> that I'll agree with
[06:42:48] <Sal> its just loosing time on old shit
[06:42:52] <SirLagz> mooncup: especially when we can do 'alias push='command command args args args args args command args args args'' :D
[06:42:59] <Foxhoundz> nearly every major site will prompt you to install their local app for a "better" experience
[06:43:12] <Sal> Foxhoundz, AND YOU KNOW WHY IT FAILED?
[06:43:33] <Sal> sorry upper
[06:43:37] <Foxhoundz> Because HTML/JS is on top of like 5 different stacks
[06:43:44] <Sal> because we don't have real programemrs anymore
[06:43:50] <Xatenev> Sal: thats so bullshit
[06:43:55] <Xatenev> :\
[06:44:00] <Foxhoundz> Sal: nope
[06:44:03] <Sal> putting a new real language in place of html, would have create caos
[06:44:15] <Xatenev> because we dont have real programmers anymore
[06:44:15] <Sal> nobody today is able to start a project from zero
[06:44:17] <Xatenev> rofl
[06:44:20] <Sal> without using google
[06:44:24] <Xatenev> people working on living forever
[06:44:29] <Xatenev> bio hackers
[06:44:31] <Xatenev> people creating AI's
[06:44:31] <Foxhoundz> Sal: JavaScript a real language
[06:44:34] <Xatenev> which learn games from their own
[06:44:35] <Sal> nah
[06:44:40] <Xatenev> but we dont have real programmres
[06:44:40] <Sal> javascript is a toy
[06:44:46] <Foxhoundz> Why is it a toy
[06:45:14] <Sal> first because of its "free" syntax
[06:45:55] <SirLagz> what 'free' syntax?
[06:45:57] <Sal> we have to thank jquery and some other framewroks if we can use it today
[06:46:07] <mooncup> so why are you here Sal?
[06:46:17] <Sal> nothing, just wanted to chat
[06:46:18] <mooncup> shouldn't you be writing vanilla js like a real programmer?
[06:46:24] <Sal> sorry if i'm boring someone
[06:46:50] <Sal> mooncup, no, i hate js
[06:46:58] <Xatenev> Sal: so what do u code in
[06:47:04] <Sal> i'm using it only because we have jquery and because there's nothing else
[06:47:23] <Xatenev> lol you just trolled yourself in all stages of your arguments
[06:47:33] <SirLagz> Sal: what are you talking about? there's lots of languages to program in, you don't *have* to use JS
[06:47:56] <Sal> i'm talking about www
[06:48:10] <SirLagz> Sal: yes...you still don't *have* to use JS
[06:48:51] <Sal> don't tell me java, flash or activex
[06:49:01] <SirLagz> Sal: well those are options
[06:49:05] <Sal> ùno
[06:49:11] <Sal> they are html plugins
[06:49:28] <Sal> i'm taking about a native browser language
[06:50:00] <Sal> i'm talking about creating we pages starting with:
[06:50:03] <SirLagz> why do you need to use a native browser language? you could always do everything serverside
[06:50:04] <Sal> #include....
[06:50:13] <Sal> function main() {---}
[06:50:16] <Sal> clear?
[06:50:33] <Xatenev> why do we need that tho
[06:50:37] <Maitiu> Anyone know of a plugin/library that could help a basic duplication of the Tesla build order form? (http://my.teslamotors.com/models/design)
[06:50:38] <Xatenev> you wanna expose all your code to the client?
[06:50:45] <Sal> a real oop under the hood
[06:50:46] <hagabaka> what language was that?
[06:51:07] <SirLagz> Sal: go build your website in Python or RoR or CF then
[06:51:15] <Sal> :)
[06:51:31] <Foxhoundz> Sal: I think you're confused on how the web works
[06:51:32] <Sal> to bad, that on client-side, you'll be html
[06:51:54] <Sal> Foxhoundz, yes, i know, i told you before
[06:52:03] <Sal> the today web works on google copy&paste
[06:52:18] <Sal> all web is like that
[06:52:54] <Sal> first think a programmer doies is think of what other's work to use or copy
[06:53:04] <hagabaka> not all web and it doesn't apply to just web
[06:53:16] <Sal> we used to start with the flow-chart
[06:53:18] <Sal> hehehe
[06:53:24] <SirLagz> Sal: or...a programmer thinks "Hey, someone else has done this perfectly already. Why re-do something that I can't do properly when I can use this properly done thing"
[06:53:37] <Sal> SirLagz, yes, thats it
[06:53:42] <Sal> thats just what i'm saying
[06:53:52] <Sal> all same look, all same fell, all same ux
[06:54:01] <Sal> if one sux, they all sux
[06:54:06] <Sal> :)
[06:54:13] <Sal> create way isn't it?
[06:54:37] <SirLagz> Sal: well if you think something sucks, go make something better
[06:55:12] <Foxhoundz> Sal: you'll eventually end up at recreating the web
[06:55:35] <Sal> there are opensource guys playing around with python, apache, etc
[06:55:46] <Varun_Krishna> Hi guys I want to split this string by 4 2 and 2 and I need to add / inbetween them http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/2yw1et4u/2/
[06:55:51] <Varun_Krishna> how do I do this ?
[06:56:07] <Foxhoundz> I think what you're looking for is essentially a modular web where pre-compiled "packages" of applications are sent to the browser to be executed natively
[06:56:09] <Sal> why aint there any opensource group that takes place of w3 and rewrites the entire www?
[06:56:14] <Foxhoundz> i.e. a desktop application
[06:56:39] <SirLagz> Sal: because there's no need to?
[06:56:58] <Sal> SirLagz, yes there is
[06:57:13] <Sal> w3.org is controlled by ms, apple, sun, etc
[06:57:19] <Sal> its not free
[06:57:36] <Sal> they tell those guys what must be passed and what not
[06:57:48] <hagabaka> Varun_Krishna: look up RegExp.exec, character class, and repetition
[06:57:55] <Sal> Foxhoundz, that sould be the right direction
[06:58:26] <SirLagz> Sal: if that's what you want then go use Android/Apple devices. they're already there...
[06:58:32] <Sal> web applications, had to be something like that
[06:58:34] <Varun_Krishna> hagabaka: I want to achieve somethinglike this 2015/09/09
[06:58:34] <hagabaka> Varun_Krishna: but the quick answer is /(\d{4})(\d{2})(\d{2})/
[06:58:47] <Sal> but thanks to apple, they just became html without flashù
[06:58:48] <Varun_Krishna> Ok let me try it
[06:59:43] <Sal> ok, sorry if i was boring
[06:59:47] <Sal> thanks for the chat
[07:00:08] <Sal> need to find a nice solution for my backdrop panels
[07:00:12] <Sal> bye
[07:00:51] <Varun_Krishna> hagabaka: http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/2yw1et4u/3/
[07:00:55] <Varun_Krishna> is this it >?
[07:01:43] <Varun_Krishna> but how do I add slash in between ?
[07:05:23] <hagabaka> Varun_Krishna: you're joining them with "<br>", and you need to join with "/" instead. Also match returns ["20150907", "2015", "09", "07"], and you need to remove the first element first, and you can use Array.slice for that
[07:08:52] <Varun_Krishna> http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/2yw1et4u/4/
[07:08:59] <Varun_Krishna> why is it coming like this ?
[07:10:19] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: you're requiering a css file that has a slow server
[07:10:30] <Cork> so it blocks rendering
[07:11:11] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: How do I remove the first element ?
[07:11:27] <Cork> donno the fiddle doesn't render
[07:11:33] <Cork> so no clue what is on it
[07:12:18] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/2yw1et4u/5/
[07:12:24] <Varun_Krishna> is that the best way to do ?
[07:12:41] <sweet2k4> question: is it possible to send and file to a php script using ajax.  $file = $('#fileToUpload').files[0]; and then send $file as data?
[07:12:56] <Cork> sweet2k4: check mdn formData
[07:13:18] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: still doesn't render
[07:13:43] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/2yw1et4u/7/
[07:13:49] <sweet2k4> Cork: so it needs to be a formData to send  a file?
[07:14:13] <Cork> sweet2k4: yes, formData was explicitly added to allow sending files over ajax
[07:14:34] <sweet2k4> Cork: alright then it makes sens
[07:15:36] <sweet2k4> Cork: is it possible to send a formData with the image and also varibles that is not included in the form data?
[07:15:41] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: this is what i get http://i.imgur.com/og6Y3oY.png
[07:15:55] <Cork> so again, no clue until you fix the broken css
[07:16:07] <Cork> sweet2k4: yes it is
[07:16:14] <Cork> just use the append method
[07:16:27] <sweet2k4> Cork: okey, thanks!
[07:16:41] <Cork> sweet2k4: you can add any data you have to formData
[07:16:51] <Cork> even a Blob or BinaryArray
[07:17:02] <sweet2k4> alright, good to know
[07:17:03] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: I am sorry about that.
[07:17:06] <Varun_Krishna> fixed it.
[07:17:17] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: cya
[07:17:23] <Varun_Krishna> *ciao
[07:23:55] <sweet2k4> Cork: one more thing: how do i get the file from the input into the fromData?$image = $('#input-upload').files[0]; formdata.append("image", $image); does not work
[07:29:35] <Cork> sweet2k4: formdata.append('image', $('#input-upload')[0].file[0]);
[07:29:52] <Cork> [0] is needed after $() to get access to the raw dom object
[07:30:12] <Cork> sweet2k4: this should also work: formdata.append('image', $('#input-upload').prop('files')[0]);
[07:30:34] <Cork> (i missed the s in files in the first example)
[07:31:03] <sweet2k4> Cork: oh, alright il try that
[07:35:17] <sweet2k4> Cork: TypeError: 'append' called on an object that does not implement interface FormData. could it be that im using an old version of jquery?
[07:35:37] <Cork> sweet2k4: no, formdata is a browser native
[07:35:50] <Cork> so you do var formdata = new FormData();
[07:36:35] <sweet2k4> formdata = new FormData(); or var formdata = new FormData();?
[07:36:48] <Cork> always var
[07:37:00] <Cork> unless you've already defined the variable
[07:37:19] <Cork> else the variable becomes a global
[07:37:19] <sweet2k4> yeah i had var when the error occured.
[07:37:25] <sweet2k4> ok
[07:37:50] <sweet2k4> in this example they use a global var in the case: http://webkul.com/blog/send-images-through-ajax/
[07:38:06] <Cork> yup
[07:38:16] <Cork> most likely by mistake
[07:38:32] <Cork> on the other hand, that is at the top level anyway
[07:38:37] <Cork> so it is a global what ever they do
[07:39:09] <sweet2k4> ok, well the error refers to the jquery.min.js file
[07:39:53] <Cork> ah, right $.ajax expects to get an object or a string
[07:39:59] <Cork> you need to disable parsing
[07:40:36] <sweet2k4> oh, how do i do that? do you have any docs?
[07:40:41] <sweet2k4> know any*
[07:41:17] <sweet2k4> or could i use jQuery.ajax instead? or is it the same thing
[07:41:24] <Cork> sweet2k4: processData and contentType = false in the $.ajax obptions
[07:41:27] <Cork> *options
[07:42:58] <sweet2k4> Cork: great now it works!, i left those out since i didnt know what they did. thank you very much!
[07:44:10] <Cork> sweet2k4: i recommend reading api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax
[07:45:06] <sweet2k4> Cork: il do that, thanks for advice
[07:45:31] <Cork> actually i recommend reading api.jquery.com, period :)
[07:46:15] <sweet2k4> hehe, if i had 2 lifetimes over for reading ;)
[07:46:28] <Cork> it isn't that much to read
[07:47:26] <sweet2k4> i hvnt checked tbh, but maybe a good nighttime passing
[07:48:13] <Cork> heh i didn't mean you should read it from back to end
[07:48:17] <Cork> read the listing of functions
[07:48:41] <Cork> and if you don't know what a function does have a quick look at the funciton definition at the top of each page
[07:49:04] <decx> reading the api like a book would just mean i forget 9/10 things because learning without context is hard
[07:49:13] <Cork> ya
[07:49:33] <decx> but knowing the methods and looking up their options everytime you use a new one helps out
[07:49:48] <Cork> exactly
[07:50:33] <decx> this one is handy tho http://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[07:50:38] <decx> to just read
[08:07:23] <robhol> Hi there. I'm looking for a way to replace text globally in a page. For a quick mockup, I just did x.html( x.html().replace(...) ), but I don't want it to actually tamper with HTML. Is there a quick ninja-trick with selectors I can use to only run my replace function on "text"?
[08:09:30] <robhol> ... arc_ ? this might be a long shot, but did you happen to be involved with MTA? :p
[08:24:27] <decx> you dont have to double call html(), inside html() you already have access to the html in stringform
[08:25:03] <decx> html(function(i,html){ return html.replace(/replace/g,'replacewith')) something like that
[08:25:18] <robhol> oh, okay. That's good to know, I guess :)
[08:25:38] <decx> text() will flatten so you'd have to go to the deepest elements manually
[08:25:53] <decx> probably more effort than just messing with the html in stringform
[08:26:38] <Xatenev> decx: what code editor/IDE are u using?
[08:26:48] <Xatenev> for ur daily work?
[08:26:51] <decx> brackets atm
[08:27:03] <robhol> yeah. Doing some .each hocus-pocus is one way, I waas just wondering if there were any easier ways. I imagine trying to "manually" pick up text from a tag that may contain, say, <p><span>asdf</span> ghjkl</p> would be a hassle
[08:27:42] <robhol> p is fine, you get the span, all good - but what about the text next to it? :p
[08:28:05] <decx> look at contents()
[08:28:46] <robhol> aha!
[08:29:38] <robhol> that looks a lot more helpful than messing around with the strings themselves, thanks :p
[08:29:56] <decx> it's finicky
[08:30:13] <AlexN> Hello, I have a third-party widget which I want to extend. Is this possible?
[08:30:28] <robhol> decx: how so?
[08:31:04] <decx> contents on your p would have 2 elements, span and a textnode, but what if there's another level of elements inside the span
[08:31:14] <decx> so you'd have to do contents() on your contents()
[08:32:56] <decx> all the global replacers (for word highlights or something) i've seen just do replace on a big ass html string
[08:38:23] <robhol> I'd already counted on having to go recursive in order to do it "properly"
[08:39:02] <robhol> unless I'm missing something, it doesn't seem that bad. Certainly preferrable to taking the risk of replacing something you shouldn't and fucking up the whole page, lol
[09:04:32] <c0d3n4m3> When you run through an $().each loop, how can I target the first element/object in the loop?
[09:04:47] <c0d3n4m3> Something like element[0]
[09:05:30] <c0d3n4m3> As I want to do something in that loop with just the first object, and something different with the rest
[09:34:36] <Es0teric> does anyone have a jquery plugin for full screen navigation/
[09:34:42] <Es0teric> ?
[09:41:53] <robertmaxrees> full screen navigation?
[09:43:58] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah
[09:44:18] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://tympanus.net/Development/FullscreenOverlayStyles/
[09:44:43] <robertmaxrees> an overlay you mean?
[09:45:22] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees an overlay of a navigation
[09:45:32] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to use what's on that page then,.
[10:52:16] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:53:11] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[10:54:22] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: sup?
[10:54:40] <Guest1000000> Hello.
[10:54:48] <rindolf> Guest1000000: hi.
[10:54:50] <robertmaxrees> not a lot rindolf.  you?
[10:54:53] <rindolf> Guest1000000: sup?
[10:55:11] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: I've tested and validated two Mageia Linux updates today.
[10:55:19] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: and went on two walks.
[10:55:27] <robertmaxrees> cool
[10:55:34] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: and was the first to 11:11 on #Reddit
[10:55:44] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:56:23] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: what?
[10:57:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your last sentence means.
[11:00:55] <rogger_h> Hello, i was wondering, there is a way to listen to ajax calls?
[11:01:06] <robertmaxrees> rogger_h what do you mean?
[11:01:19] <rogger_h> i mean everytime ajax call happened i will know about it
[11:01:24] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[11:01:30] <rogger_h> same like click,change event listners
[11:01:33] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/ these exist, but only work for jquery ajax events iirc.
[11:01:43] <rogger_h> hmm
[11:01:50] <robertmaxrees> though i'd avoid using those if possible.
[11:01:52] <rogger_h> so if its not jquery i wont be able to know about them
[11:02:01] <rogger_h> Ok , got it
[11:02:10] <rogger_h> what about, on dom update
[11:02:10] <robertmaxrees> you could also use your network panel in your dev tools.
[11:02:18] <Guest1000000> Do they also work for cross site ajax calls ?
[11:02:28] <robertmaxrees> Guest1000000 those are ajax calls, so yes.
[11:02:37] <robertmaxrees> rogger_h that's a bad idea imo - leads to difficult to understand code.
[11:02:45] <robertmaxrees> rogger_h what's the issue you're trying to solve?
[11:03:18] <rogger_h> i dont want to mess with my magento cart proccess. which have a complex ajax dom update code
[11:03:34] <rogger_h> i want to be able to identify when the DOM layout is changed so i can run my own stuff
[11:03:44] <rogger_h> so its rather dom update or ajax calls
[11:03:45] <robertmaxrees> that sounds way hacky.
[11:03:53] <rogger_h> Yes it is
[11:03:55] <rogger_h> but thats what i need
[11:04:11] <robertmaxrees> that's going ot make your problem worse fwiw.
[11:04:19] <rogger_h> i dont think so really
[11:04:25] <robertmaxrees> sure it will.
[11:04:30] <rogger_h> there is a way to know about dom update?
[11:04:34] <rogger_h> dom change
[11:04:48] <robertmaxrees> there are, but browser support is funky and it can be really slow.
[11:05:07] <rogger_h> i actually need specific element update
[11:05:07] <robertmaxrees> plus you're munging your frontend js.  i'll bet you magento is using jquery for the ajax calls.
[11:05:22] <robertmaxrees> try registering a global listener and see if that works.
[11:05:33] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i'd extend the core functionality.
[11:05:37] <rogger_h> but how do i listen to element update
[11:05:46] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that - try the jquery method first.
[11:06:01] <rogger_h> <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i'd extend the core functionality.
[11:06:07] <rogger_h> what did you mean?
[11:06:33] <robertmaxrees> extend magento - it supports plugins, right?
[11:06:36] <robertmaxrees> or patch it yourself.
[11:07:15] <rogger_h> to mess with that pure js i will die soon
[11:07:43] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do then?
[11:09:48] <rogger_h> i have a custom gateway which need to show up if a certine payment method is choosen , the original magento one page have a button , when clicked it shows/redirect the payment form. my client want it to show as soon as the method choosen. the problem is when the other element edit, when the ajax refresh all elemts and disapear the form again
[11:10:00] <rogger_h> so i need to fire it again...
[11:10:21] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to actuall integrate the gateway.
[11:10:34] <rogger_h> i did , but not in the front end
[11:10:53] <rogger_h> which is  TOTAL craziness which my client request
[11:11:02] <rogger_h> im not gonna do it the hard way .. so looking for hacks
[11:11:06] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[11:11:11] <robertmaxrees> it's a payment module right?
[11:11:15] <rogger_h> Yes
[11:11:16] <robertmaxrees> like, that's how you do that.
[11:11:32] <robertmaxrees> so actually support it.  otheriwse you're going to get calls when they patch their install that things are broken.
[11:11:59] <rogger_h> Yes but the orignal one works, its specific request to change all logic
[11:12:14] <rogger_h> and im not gonna do that for only that client
[11:12:29] <robertmaxrees> then tell them why you can't do the request?  lol
[11:12:34] <rogger_h> omg man
[11:12:36] <rogger_h> hehe
[11:12:39] <rogger_h> i just need help :)
[11:12:45] <robertmaxrees> messing with payment systems is a really bad idea.
[11:13:15] <rogger_h> its just front end, eventually all validating on server side anywy
[11:13:37] <robertmaxrees> still a bad idea.  a quick google search will get you what you want if you really want to watch things update on the apge.
[11:13:42] <robertmaxrees> but again, browser support is funky.
[11:13:58] <rogger_h> hmm
[11:14:04] <rogger_h> ok i will dig into that more
[11:14:05] <rogger_h> thanks bro
[12:26:32] <asas_> wich is the equivalent of $var[] of php in jquery?
[12:26:48] <robertmaxrees> there... isn't?
[12:26:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a language
[12:27:15] <robertmaxrees> what is $var[] ? that for an object?
[12:27:25] <rindolf> asas_: do you want arrays? To append to an array?
[12:27:52] <robertmaxrees> rindolf 5 bucks says plain object - that looks like the "associative array" syntax for PHP iirc.
[12:28:14] <Guest1000000> But it can also mean appeanding to the end of an array.
[12:28:16] <asas_> yes
[12:28:39] <robertmaxrees> asas_ you use .push() to append things to an array,.
[12:28:52] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just specify the key.
[12:31:03] <robertmaxrees> var myObject = {}; myObject.foo = 'some string';
[12:47:39] <asas_> somebody who want to win 10 usd for help me with some issue I have?
[12:47:46] <asas_> I pay in paypal
[12:47:50] <robertmaxrees> wrong place for that asas_
[12:48:06] <robertmaxrees> if you want a freelancer, go to a channel for it. otherwise, we can help for free here.
[12:49:03] <asas_> robertmaxrees : can you help me in a little issue
[12:49:09] <asas_> I dont knowwhat else to do
[12:49:15] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask - ask the channel.
[12:49:20] <robertmaxrees> just put your question out there :)
[12:49:32] <asas_> isn't just a question
[12:49:40] <asas_> you will have to see my script
[12:49:46] <asas_> and what it do
[12:49:48] <robertmaxrees> right - that's pretty common.
[12:50:06] <rindolf> asas_: can you publicly share it?
[12:50:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:50:25] <robertmaxrees> you could make a functioning use case here or paste up your code on a service like bpaste.
[12:50:44] <asas_> http://jsfiddle.net/1kmzfd7q/
[12:50:54] <asas_> This is a js function
[12:51:00] <robertmaxrees> sow hat's the question?
[12:51:18] <asas_> I have a problem inside grep function
[12:51:36] <asas_> I have a main table with sublevels
[12:51:41] <asas_> jtable
[12:51:58] <asas_> for each sublevel it must to get the info of that cell
[12:52:02] <asas_> do it ok
[12:52:03] <robertmaxrees> hold up
[12:52:20] <robertmaxrees> if you're having an issue with just the grep, share an example of that data.
[12:52:33] <asas_> but in the grep function repeat the same last sublevels many times and doesn't run all the cells
[12:53:08] <asas_> no becasue the grep function cause for the each funcion
[12:53:11] <asas_> function
[12:53:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:54:00] <robertmaxrees> show us what the data looks like, yo.
[12:54:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise we can't really help :)_
[12:55:07] <asas_> http://i.imgur.com/xFQgGq8.png
[12:55:08] <asas_> like this
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[12:55:31] <asas_> so?
[12:56:14] <robertmaxrees> you said something about the grep isn't working correctly, right?
[12:56:38] <robertmaxrees> so you're using grep (with a weird for in loop) to do... something.  but you won't show me the data.
[12:56:50] <asas_> ok
[12:56:53] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure how you expect anybody to help you.
[12:56:53] <asas_> wait me
[12:57:08] <robertmaxrees> try boiling the question down - is it about $.grep()?  or about looping?
[12:58:21] <asas_> I thing better about looping
[12:58:42] <robertmaxrees> also, if (item[key].itemNum == itemf && key == docf && item[key].nit == $nit) { is relaly strange.
[12:59:02] <robertmaxrees> docf starts as an array (don't use new Array() by the way) and then magicall turns ino a string later on.
[12:59:06] <asas_> http://jsfiddle.net/gbvr0wpb/
[12:59:19] <asas_> like this you see if I dump  docf var
[12:59:35] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:00:39] <robertmaxrees> what is that fac variable?
[13:02:25] <asas_> http://jsfiddle.net/cu7s3b2z/
[13:02:43] <asas_> and this if I dump inside the grep function the item vaiable
[13:02:56] <asas_> can I show you remotely?
[13:03:10] <asas_> is very complex for explain with jsfiddle
[13:05:13] <robertmaxrees> please don't PM me or send me creds or anything.
[13:05:28] <robertmaxrees> just do console.log(JSON.stringfy(fac));
[13:05:42] <robertmaxrees> right before that grep call.
[13:09:34] <asas_> JSON.stringfy is not a function
[13:09:36] <asas_> show me this
[13:10:10] <robertmaxrees> err, JSON.stringify
[13:10:15] <robertmaxrees> missing an i in there.
[13:20:25] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:23:27] <asas_> robertmaxrees : how can I to store several vars from a each function in one var?
[13:23:43] <robertmaxrees> you create an array and push them in.
[13:23:51] <robertmaxrees> or use .map() to put them into the var.
[13:24:06] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you're running the each against.
[13:24:30] <robertmaxrees> console.log(JSON.stringify(fac)); - just pop this data somewhere and share it.
[13:24:32] <robertmaxrees> simple stuff ;)
[13:25:19] <asas_> http://jsfiddle.net/gbvr0wpb/1/
[13:25:23] <asas_> output this
[13:25:26] <charpandnl> good evening!
[13:25:45] <robertmaxrees> asas_ that doesn't make any sense - you have a bunch of strings?
[13:25:56] <robertmaxrees> hello charpandnl :)
[13:26:15] <charpandnl> I'm struggling a bit with the autocomplete, can I fire my questions here, or do I need to go to the #jquery-ui?
[13:26:31] <asas_> <td class="refer" id="001">5200000016</td>
[13:26:40] <asas_> this is a td of my table
[13:26:44] <robertmaxrees> charpandnl you can ask here.
[13:27:02] <robertmaxrees> asas_ so you're running .each() against a bunch of DOM nodeS?
[13:27:04] <asas_> I need to get all the ins't checked
[13:27:08] <asas_> yes
[13:27:19] <robertmaxrees> use .map() to do it then.
[13:27:37] <asas_> docf+=$(id0row).text();
[13:27:40] <asas_> I do it like this
[13:27:46] <asas_> how will be?
[13:27:50] <robertmaxrees> that will create a string - that's not a good way to do that,.
[13:27:57] <robertmaxrees> do the TDs have checkboxes in them?
[13:27:57] <charpandnl> I'm trying to achieve a single select autocomplete, based on a select, but with changing option attributes (disabled). This means a disabled option will not appear in the list
[13:28:08] <charpandnl> but still exists on the select
[13:28:17] <asas_> this td no
[13:28:26] <robertmaxrees> asas_ is it a TD in that TR?
[13:28:34] <asas_> yes
[13:29:32] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mcrtfqgk/1/
[13:30:09] <charpandnl> but all the results a had so far were creating a buggy custom autocomplete, which selected the first option most of the time, or not select anything at all
[13:30:40] <robertmaxrees> charpandnl do you have an example of your code or something similar you can put in a jsfiddle?
[13:31:03] <charpandnl> i'll try to set something up :) hold on ;)
[13:32:59] <robertmaxrees> asas_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mcrtfqgk/2/
[13:42:06] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/38ej why doesn't clicking on profileImage work for me? am I missing the obvious?
[13:42:32] <robertmaxrees> is this code in your chead?
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> *head
[13:43:02] <robertmaxrees> oh, easy - need a delegated listener.
[13:43:07] <Kartagis> what do you mean?
[13:43:07] <dopie> Hey all
[13:43:11] <robertmaxrees> .profileImage doesn't exist on pagelaod.
[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> need to do $('#contentHolder').on('click', '.profileImage', getProfile);
[13:43:42] <robertmaxrees> dopie hello!
[13:43:51] <dopie> hallo robertmaxrees  :)
[13:44:45] <Kartagis> hrm
[13:44:48] <dopie> question how would I write this,  I have 10 text boxes and  2 dropdown I dont want the submit button to be clickable until the user fills out all of the form...
[13:45:32] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: does it matter within or out the $(function() block?
[13:45:50] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis you'll likely need to move it there, as well.
[13:46:13] <robertmaxrees> dopie make the submit disabled. each time a user changes a text box / dropdown, change a data attribute on it, then check all of them to see if they're all "true" or something similar.
[13:47:23] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: but what did you mean by "is this code in your head?"?
[13:47:32] <robertmaxrees> is it inside of the head tag?
[13:47:33] <robertmaxrees> the <head>
[13:48:08] <Kartagis> no, it's a js file
[13:48:20] <robertmaxrees> how is that js file linked in your page?
[13:48:26] <robertmaxrees> is the script tag in the <head> somewhere?
[13:48:48] <charpandnl> robertmaxrees, how to I enable jquery 2.1.1 with ui 1.11.2 in jsfiddle?
[13:48:55] <Kartagis> no, close to the end of <body>
[13:49:00] <robertmaxrees> charpandnl you don't.
[13:49:13] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis then you don't need the document ready bits in there.
[13:49:36] <Kartagis> aka $(function()
[13:49:40] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[13:49:40] <Kartagis> right?
[13:49:44] <Kartagis> cool
[13:49:51] <robertmaxrees> as long as your code is after the relevant markup, you're fine.
[13:49:53] <Kartagis> good to know, thanks
[13:50:02] <charpandnl> why is that combination not allowed?
[13:50:03] <robertmaxrees> I'd maybe wrap all your code in an IIFE to scope it, but meh.
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> charpandnl it's not that is isn't allowed, it's just not set up :) you can mnanually do it yourself, or you can use older versions.
[13:58:15] <charpandnl> http://jsfiddle.net/charpandnl/uaL2vedp/
[13:58:39] <charpandnl> only it does seem, the it works correctly in there
[13:58:40] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:58:41] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:59:34] <krambal> hi guys
[14:00:38] <robertmaxrees> charpandnl so you can't replicate the issue?
[14:00:43] <paulong_> ok Its impossible to me! Idk what more to do http://imgur.com/c8JsI26   http://imgur.com/jZ5V6ZM
[14:00:48] <charpandnl> not on the fiddle atm
[14:00:58] <paulong_> I still cannot open my files!
[14:01:05] <robertmaxrees> paulong_ you can't use history api without a server.
[14:01:06] <charpandnl> And I can't give you access to the source ;)
[14:01:16] <robertmaxrees> charpandnl i wouldn't want them anyway :)
[14:01:43] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: is $("#contentHolder .profileImage").on("click", getProfile); and $("#contentHolder").on("click", ".profileImage", getProfile); the same thing?
[14:01:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:02:09] <paulong_> robertmaxrees but I dont get it!!! before I could open
[14:02:21] <paulong_> why not now
[14:02:27] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis the second one binds a delegated listener.
[14:02:37] <robertmaxrees> paulong_ you were probably using a server before.
[14:03:45] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis the first one finds all $("#contentHolder .profileImage") when it runs and binds an event listener to each one.  any that get added after that code runs won't get "seen"
[14:04:35] <robertmaxrees> $("#contentHolder").on("click", ".profileImage", getProfile); this binds the listener to #contentHolder instead.  any .profileImage elements that get added after the binding runs will work since it uses the facty that elements bubble.
[14:05:30] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: still no :S
[14:05:38] <robertmaxrees> "still no" what?
[14:05:42] <Kartagis> doesn't work :S
[14:05:49] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have.
[14:07:04] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/1kvv
[14:07:46] <robertmaxrees> what is #btn?
[14:08:19] <Kartagis> it's a button, that bit works
[14:08:26] <robertmaxrees> so then what part doesn't work?
[14:08:50] <robertmaxrees> var nid = e.nid; - this is broken btw.
[14:10:15] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: the getProfile relevant thing doesn't
[14:10:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because of what i just pointed out.
[14:11:23] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to access a prop of the event object but you don't pass it in.
[14:11:28] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/36babd61d634
[14:11:34] <robertmaxrees> fixed here along with some other tweaks.
[14:16:22] <asas_> robertmaxrees : I found the problem
[14:16:30] <asas_> but I don't know how to fix it
[14:16:39] <robertmaxrees> what the issue.
[14:16:59] <asas_> http://jsfiddle.net/1kmzfd7q/
[14:17:07] <asas_> see the first each
[14:17:22] <robertmaxrees> don't make me search for it.
[14:17:24] <robertmaxrees> where is it?
[14:17:59] <asas_> 19 line
[14:19:08] <asas_> http://jsfiddle.net/cmn5n0t7/
[14:19:32] <asas_> This is what have the fac var
[14:19:37] <robertmaxrees> $(".jtable tbody").find("tr").find("td[class='categoria']").each(function() { this?
[14:19:46] <asas_> yes
[14:20:23] <asas_> the issue is inside the 2 times each function is looping the fac var
[14:20:31] <asas_> understand me?
[14:20:53] <robertmaxrees> because that could be literally just $(".jtable .categoria") for that first one btw.
[14:21:37] <asas_> isn't possible because is inside jtable
[14:21:45] <asas_> is very weird that DOM
[14:21:52] <robertmaxrees> that's literally what your current code is doing.
[14:22:58] <robertmaxrees> either way, what are you trying to fix now?
[14:24:56] <asas_> the fac var inside the 2 each() functions doesn't repeats many times
[14:26:02] <asas_> robertmaxrees : http://jsfiddle.net/71srbLn4/
[14:26:06] <asas_> this is the loop
[14:26:10] <asas_> only must be 3
[14:26:20] <robertmaxrees> what do you need me to do to help you?
[14:27:49] <asas_> help me to fix the problem
[14:27:51] <asas_> please
[14:27:55] <asas_> Is very important
[14:27:57] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you need my help with.
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> you won't give me a paired down example of your problem sooo...
[14:29:44] <asas_> I'm going explain you my problem
[14:29:52] <robertmaxrees> explaining rarely helps :)
[14:30:09] <asas_> for you understand what Im doing
[14:30:26] <robertmaxrees> just make a paired-down fiddle instead.
[14:30:49] <robertmaxrees> you're obviously trying to collect some data.
[14:34:39] <robertmaxrees> asas_ start here as an example: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mcrtfqgk/3/
[14:35:47] <asas_> robertmaxrees : can I show you by teamviewer or some app like this?
[14:35:53] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:36:10] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[14:36:21] <robertmaxrees> you need to make a small, reproducable test case that you can share with the channel.
[14:36:46] <krambal> anyone know of a reason why my aduio is working on a pc but not on a smart phone
[14:36:58] <robertmaxrees> krambal your phone is muted?
[14:37:26] <krambal> no
[14:37:39] <robertmaxrees> you mean on a page?
[14:37:50] <krambal> http://137.118.248.87/word_ap/john.php
[14:37:53] <krambal> i dont think so
[14:38:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm not hearing anything there.
[14:38:30] <robertmaxrees> aaaah woah
[14:39:09] <krambal> huh ?
[14:39:21] <robertmaxrees> i opened the link in chrome and heard it;.
[14:39:27] <robertmaxrees> pretty loud.
[14:39:45] <robertmaxrees> and that's probably because the device/browser doesn't support that audio format.
[14:40:14] <krambal> its playing aac
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> not in firefox it's not.
[14:40:28] <krambal> can you try it on your phone ?
[14:40:30] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the mobile browser/device doesn't natively sup[port that.
[14:40:32] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[14:41:01] <krambal> it works with windows edge
[14:41:43] <robertmaxrees> so it works with desktop chrome and edge.
[14:41:55] <robertmaxrees> try using mp3 files instead maybe?
[14:41:55] <krambal> and IE
[14:44:24] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home.  enjoy!
[14:50:04] <krambal> will mp3s work across all browsers ?
[15:06:24] <paulong_> still online?
[15:09:48] <dunkel2> yes

[16:53:42] <ailaG> Hi. Promises question: I’m iterating through ajax calls like so:  clients.each(function() { $.ajax(/* get client info */ }) ;   I want to do something when they’re all done. What’s the syntax? $.when doesn’t do the trick, it fires before the ajax calls get their callbacks.
[16:58:57] <shoky_> ailaG:  var requests = clients.map(function() { return $.ajax(/* get client info */ });  $.when.apply($, requests).done(...)
[16:59:36] <ailaG> shoky_: Thanks, trying…
[17:04:12] <ailaG> shoky_: GREAT, seems to work perfectly. Thanks!
[17:04:58] <shoky_> np
[17:27:13] <ailaG> Goodnight
[17:31:26] <HowardwLo> help! https://dpaste.de/3z8W this is working and posting normally, no errors. however this: https://dpaste.de/aMMb gives me syntax error, unexpected token h. h is the first character in the value of #mce-PAGE which is a hidden input field
[17:31:38] <HowardwLo> im not sure whats wrong
[17:33:03] <HowardwLo> it’s on line 6 btw !
[17:42:08] <HowardwLo> example: https://dpaste.de/LMDW#L this would return unexpected token “s”
[17:44:43] <shoky_> HowardwLo: maybe when you add that "page" to the post data, the server responds differently?  e.g. doesn't respond with JSON so your parseJSON is causing a syntax error
[17:45:03] <shoky_> check the devtools network tab to see the actual response
[17:45:45] <shoky_> my guess would be the server doesn't like that data, and responds with an error message maybe, that starts with the page value you gave it
[17:45:46] <HowardwLo> shoky_: the post data looks fine
[17:46:02] <shoky_> i'm talking about the response, not the request
[17:47:25] <HowardwLo> shoky_: ahhhh. i think i found it, i had a stray echo in the response
[17:47:27] <HowardwLo> thanks :)
[17:47:36] <HowardwLo> what a stupid mistake
[17:48:58] <shoky_> that'd do it too, heh
[19:04:59] <feathersanddown> Hi!, is there any .ui-droppable  class in css files ?
[19:22:19] <Guddu_> Why does a form submitted on a button's click event does not send all form fields in the POST data?
[19:25:49] <Guddu_> I have double checked and the form field has the name set too
[19:25:50] <Guddu_> <input type='hidden' id="seal_bin_input" name="seal_bin_input" value="">
[19:27:00] <Guddu_> My relevant code is http://dpaste.com/26KJ65N
[19:27:08] <Guddu_> Appreciate if someone could guide me with this.
[19:40:43] <feathersanddown> Guddu_:  are those hidden inputs inside forms tags ?
[19:41:18] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, Thanks for your response. Yes they are.
[19:41:19] <Guddu_> Here is the Html code http://dpaste.com/2DYH6CR
[19:41:44] <Guddu_> On line 201 I am setting that form field and then submitting 2 lines later
[19:41:48] <Guddu_> But POST does not receive it
[19:42:35] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, The ajax call made inside assign_vehicle_conductor() submits it
[19:43:05] <feathersanddown> wich fields doesn't fill?
[19:43:18] <Guddu_> But the call made at line 202 does not
[19:43:51] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, Two fields. #seal_bin_input and #seal_load_input
[19:52:51] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, What do you think could be done?
[19:54:02] <feathersanddown> wait me
[19:55:06] <Guddu_> Thanks feathersanddown I will wait
[19:57:08] <feathersanddown> for clear code, try to put your javascripts inside one <script></script> tag at the end of page
[19:59:06] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, I will do that but is that the error?
[19:59:18] <feathersanddown> line226, do a console.log(data) and check what have
[19:59:38] <feathersanddown> and add a ;
[20:01:43] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, I will add that. But this is not a ajax call. The form gets submitted when i do a click on #return_to_previous_view button
[20:01:50] <Guddu_> Line 202
[20:03:24] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, Result of that console.log is this though
[20:03:24] <Guddu_> csrfmiddlewaretoken=LLRdcSKHL8pO3ExpXhwKyC6MzfdhsRcA&load_nbr=343348&vehicle_or_conductor=CONDUCTOR&vehicle_plate_number_input=XXXXXX&conductor_rut_input=111111111&seal_bin_input=&seal_load_input=
[20:07:08] <feathersanddown> do you know if "seal_bin" is filled correctly?
[20:08:00] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, Yes. I did a alert and it showed up
[20:12:34] <feathersanddown> what say firefox/chrome in network tab ?
[20:18:11] <Guddu_> feathersanddown, I will check now
[20:23:17] <Guddu_> WHat could be the calllback event to call when a user enters some data on a textfield and presses tab or moves to another field?
[21:10:42] <tash> I've got some things being hidden with .hide(), but as the page loads, you can see them for a second or so, then they hide.  How can they be hidden instantly?
[21:12:16] <mazpe> i
[21:12:42] <mazpe> im trying to a blob of a canvas to upload it... using this code: https://jsfiddle.net/wn8zya2z/
[21:13:02] <mazpe> but on the dev console, i'm getting: Uncaught TypeError: $(...).cropper(...).toBlob is not a function
[22:05:01] <doctorly> I have a form that is dynamically generated through ajax, but I am not able to submit the form through ajax after. I believe that my problem is my js doesn't see the newly created form. Is there a method I should look into? I don't have any code to show, it is closed source, I am a student though.
[22:12:21] <monk3y> doctorly: heheh @ not being able to show us the source, "but you're a student", so that should help.  Just having a chuckle.  I understand if you can't show it but it makes it hard.
[22:12:58] <monk3y> Have you got time to step through it?  Like; how is the JS attempting to submit the form?  Is something bound to the form, or to a submit button?
[22:13:59] <monk3y> It might be best if you could write a pastebin, mimicking the bare minimum of how your form is structured, and the JS that's listening/reacting to it.
[22:15:07] <doctorly> There is a submit button, js is listening for me to click it using the `.submit` function. But it won't even react to that.
[22:15:17] <monk3y> (so all you'd need is; <form id="blah" action="blah"><button id="blah"></form>, then the JS; $("#formId/#buttonId").on("..") etc)
[22:16:14] <doctorly> Let me try that, one moment
[22:17:07] <monk3y> Ok.  So are you using .submit to register a handler (button.on("submit"..)..), or are you triggering it on another event; (button.submit())?
[22:17:15] <tash> wondering if doctorly is having a similar issue to what I'm running into...
[22:17:26] <tash> I *can* share some code though :)
[22:17:29] <monk3y> Yaay!
[22:17:47] <Uhkis> doctorly: http://api.jquery.com/on/ read the delegated events part
[22:17:49] <tash> I'll share a pastebin then explain my trouble. Might help him/her out
[22:17:54] <tash> and me!
[22:18:32] <Uhkis> tash: please use jsfiddle.net
[22:19:10] <monk3y> Uhkis: yeah it might be as simple as; $("#idOfStaticElementContainingForm).on("submit", "#idOfDynamicForm", function(e)) etc.
[22:19:26] <doctorly> Yeah, I am using .submit I think that the link Uhkis just posted is what I need
[22:19:35] <tash> Uhkis: sure, will use jsfiddle
[22:19:42] <monk3y> If the form's generated, it's possible the submit handler is attempted to be bound before the form's rendered.
[22:19:51] <doctorly> monk3y: I tried something like that, but I think I just don't know enough about the method, I will read more
[22:19:58] <monk3y> Aiight.
[22:20:23] <doctorly> monk3y: I think that is exactly what is happening
[22:21:16] <monk3y> Yeah ok.  Can you tell me the element you create the form 'inside'?  As in, its static parent that's there when the page is rendered?
[22:26:38] <tash> https://jsfiddle.net/m5xo649b/ Sorry I don't think the fiddle is really as complete as it needs to be.  The trouble I'm having is when I click on the Acknowledge button, nothing happens. Literally nothing.  I'd at least expect the console.log() to show something in the console.  But nothing.  When the page I'm working with loads, the hide() stuff works properly.  I'm trying to show() it based on the user clicking the Acknowledge button.
[22:26:58] <surianup> hi all
[22:27:15] <tash> basically trying to un-hide the stuff I hid ^
[22:28:29] <tash> hmm, I thin I'm missing a curly
[22:28:31] <tash> think
[22:29:32] <Uhkis> tash: you didn't close your document.ready function
[22:30:16] <tash> yeah, that's what I meant by just mentioning I think I'm missing a curly ... one sec
[22:30:24] <tash> I might have successfully rubber-ducked
[22:30:26] <tash> lol
[22:30:31] <monk3y> You need });
[22:30:32] <doctorly> Unkis, monk3y: that was is, made it to the next error! thanks a lot guys, gonna crash now. this was keeping me up lmao
[22:30:58] <Uhkis> doctorly: it's h!
[22:31:31] <doctorly> Uhkis: thanks!
[22:31:42] <monk3y> Heh @ the development debugging process; a new error = success.
[22:32:19] <Uhkis> the development of bug fixing process: a new fix = 10 new bugs
[22:33:07] <monk3y> = 10 new reasons to bill for maintenance ;)
[22:35:30] <monk3y> tash: once you've closed-off the document.ready binding, just a general HTML/CSS note: you might want to replace those 'class' identifiers with IDs.  If they're single/unique elements in your document, it's clearer to use IDs
[22:35:58] <tash> Uhkis and monk3y: I actually did have the closing }); but I just didn't have it pasted. It was below some comments that I just didn't paste.
[22:36:02] <tash> monk3y: ok
[22:36:29] <tash> but back to square one, the button seems to not work as I'd expect.  Not even getting anything in console with my console.log()
[22:37:32] <monk3y> Hmm k.  Would you mind throwing in a debugging thing; $("body").on("click", function(e) { console.log(e.target); });
[22:37:53] <monk3y> Something like that.  Then refresh and click the button, and see what the console log tells you about the element clicked.
[22:37:59] <tash> sure, np, just put in my document.ready?
[22:38:22] <monk3y> Yep; in-line with the .get and .click..
[22:38:45] <monk3y> You should see it console.log for clicking anywhere on the page.
[22:39:13] <tash> this is what the console logs when I do that: <button id="113029" class="ack">
[22:39:23] <tash> which is what I'd expect
[22:39:51] <monk3y> Interesting.
[22:39:55] <tash> very
[22:40:28] <monk3y> When I closed off your document.ready in the JSFiddle, it ran and the button did what it was supposed to (showed the console.log talking about the note/noteID)
[22:40:43] <tash> hmm
[22:40:49] <monk3y> I didn't make any other changes than closing it off.  Is your local code in any way different from the JSFiddle?
[22:41:30] <tash> for sanity's sake, this is what my code looks like right this moment: http://pastebin.com/Dq60vgFz
[22:42:35] <tash> and the only thing logging is what I just replied with a few minutes ago after adding your debug line.  I'd also expect to see "the id of this note is " + <whatever noteid is>" but I'm not.
[22:42:51] <monk3y> And have you got any errors in your console that might indicate your script is breaking anywhere?  As in, if it is breaking anywhere before the .ack.click, then it won't register (or listen)
[22:43:14] <tash> nope, checked there, I'm not getting any errors in my console =\
[22:43:57] <tash>  guess in my fiddle I was doing .ack.click huh? I tried 'button'.click() too ... should I change that back to .ack?
[22:44:10] <tash> the current code is 'button'.click
[22:45:39] <tash> hold on, I might have found the issue...testing something
[22:47:39] <tash> darn, n/m guess not
[22:48:00] <monk3y> It can be either.  If you have several buttons then go with the classes, otherwise give it an ID and $("#buttonId").on("click", etc.
[22:48:13] <monk3y> (and .click is a shortcut for .on("click"..)
[22:49:36] <tash> in my case, I shouldn't have too many buttons.  I'll give it an id
[22:49:41] <tash> and try
[22:50:00] <monk3y> Hmm.  Try updating with this; $('button').click(function(e) { var noteid = e.target.id ..
[22:50:14] <monk3y> I'm not 100% sure about it, just trying different approaches to the same result.
[22:50:26] <monk3y> Have to go afk, will be back.
[22:51:39] <tash> tried the last suggestion, same result.
[22:55:16] <tash> I gave the button id="ackbutton" and my jq looks like this $('#ackbutton').click(function(e){ var noteid = e.target.id; console.log(noteid); ... yet nothing is logging
[22:57:29] <tash> latest code: http://pastebin.com/ahkZ3m3M anyone else see anything wrong?
[23:09:33] <tash> monk3y: it definitely has something to do with the way my .get is returning stuff.  The .get call to ../modules/notes_v2.php.  when I comment that block of code out, and just statically put content in that it creates, and click the button, works fine.
[23:12:19] <guessx> .click wont recongise new content after its been made
[23:12:50] <guessx> you use to be able to use .live, now its .on('click', elm, func
[23:15:38] <tash> guessx: I was wondering about the new content thing. What does elm mean in your example?
[23:20:46] <guessx> the selector
[23:21:35] <guessx> so in your case on('click', '.ack' func
[23:26:24] <tash1> guessx: roger that. Had to step away for a minute but will try in a few minutes.
[23:44:30] <tash> guessx: so like this? $('button').on('click','.ack',function(){
[23:45:33] <tash> hope not, b/c that isn't working either
[23:46:02] <monk3y> Hey tash, sorry I was away.
[23:46:27] <monk3y> So all this content in your page; is it all static/there when the page renders, or is JS/jQuery creating it dynamically?
[23:46:38] <Cork> tash: that line looks for an element with the class "ack" that is a child of an element <button>
[23:46:43] <Uhkis> tash: the former selector needs to be a static parent element of the latter selector
[23:47:32] <monk3y> tash: $("#content-body-container").on("click", ".ack", function() {} );
[23:50:07] <tash> ah, looks like that did the trick monk3y
[23:50:24] <guessx> tash: sorry like monk3y example, or bind it to the document $(document).on(......
[23:50:40] <monk3y> tash: like the guys are saying, that will bind the on("click" listener to the existing div#content-body-container, 'cause it's there/static, and when something is clicked, it'll only respond if the e.target was #ackbutton.
[23:51:00] <tash> ah, makes sense
[23:51:07] <tash> appreciate it everyone
[23:51:37] <tash> any reason it's better to do that as opposed to $(document).on() like guessx just suggested?
[23:51:45] <monk3y> Yeah you can bind the on("click" to anything from the closest parent container, right up to <body> .. but I've seen conflicting things about binding listeners higher than you need.
[23:51:46] <tash> 6 in one, half a dozen in the other?
[23:52:03] <tash> Ok. I'll try to remember that.
[23:52:20] <tash> thanks a lot, I need to bounce and get some sleep, ttyl
[23:52:40] <monk3y> Like imagine if you end up having tens or hundreds, and they're all bound to <body>.  I really don't know if that's going to break someone's browser :/
[23:52:51] <monk3y> No probs.
