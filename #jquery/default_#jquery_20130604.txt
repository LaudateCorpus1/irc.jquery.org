[00:11:33] <anli> I am trying String.fromCharCode, but it seems to fail on punctuations: http://jsfiddle.net/JHvgS/
[00:11:34] <anli> Why?
[00:16:16] <fabioportieri> anli: because it expects unicode chars
[00:16:22] <fabioportieri> you have to use keypress
[00:16:32] <anli> But I need to do this in keydown
[00:16:37] <anli> Can I cancel a keypress?
[00:17:15] <fabioportieri> yes
[00:17:22] <fabioportieri> e.preventDefault()
[00:29:02] <soc42> hi #jquery
[00:29:27] <fabioportieri> hi soc42
[00:30:18] <soc42> I wonder why this does result in "undefined":   jQuery("#"+ formId +" input[name=foo]").val()
[00:30:37] <soc42> i have a page with multiple forms
[00:31:26] <soc42> formID is set as "form01" "form02", etc...
[00:31:51] <fabioportieri> because the form isn't in the page probably
[00:31:52] <soc42> each form has a input field <input name="foo"...
[00:32:41] <soc42> fabioportieri: you mean the DOM might be the problem?
[00:33:43] <fabioportieri> it appears to me your selector returns nothing
[00:34:41] <soc42> fabioportieri: true, i guessed there might be a problem with evaluating the string inside the jquery statement
[00:35:10] <anli> I get the diamond character when I use String.fromCharCode for for instance left arrow key press, can I compare against the "illegal character"?
[00:35:53] <fabioportieri> anli: what are you trying to do?
[00:36:14] <anli> I want to cancel keypress if the resulting text meets certain criteria
[00:36:41] <fabioportieri> and why would you want to catch arrow keys?
[00:37:04] <anli> I want to ignore them if possible
[00:37:50] <anli> preferrably without comparing against a set of keycodes
[00:38:37] <fabioportieri> try to keep as simple as possible since messing with charcodes it's a pain
[00:38:55] <Cork> anli: you can use String.fromKeyCode()
[00:39:17] <Cork> anli: other then that, you can't really, keypress happens before the string in the field has been updated
[00:39:33] <anli> Is there even a String.fromKeyCode function?
[00:39:44] <anli> you mean fromCharCode?
[00:39:49] <Cork> ?g mdn String.from Code
[00:39:51] <b-ot> Cork: String.fromCharCode - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode
[00:39:52] <bot-t> Cork, String.fromCharCode - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode
[00:39:54] <Cork> true
[00:40:03] <anli> ok
[00:40:09] <Cork> anli: you prob need to check for charCode === 0
[00:40:26] <Cork> enter backspace and so on will trigger that one
[00:40:45] <anli> I tried 0
[00:40:45] <Cork> anli: also you might want to check the input event, it MIGHT give you want you want
[00:41:52] <anli> hm, doesnt seem that ev.which and ev.keyCode contains the same thing
[00:43:06] <soc42> fabioportieri: how can i troubleshoot the available DOM-<form>-structures in firebug?
[00:43:19] <Cork> anli: notice that which, charCode, keyCode is all depricated :)
[00:43:39] <anli> What is more up to date then?
[00:43:50] <Cork> anli: nothing cross browser :)
[00:43:56] <anli> :)
[00:44:04] <Cork> it's a bit funny, but char is the "new" standard
[00:44:12] <Cork> though i don't know of any browser supporting it
[00:44:25] <fabioportieri> soc42: there is a dom tab somewhere and the inspect tool
[00:44:41] <anli> Seems like arrow left results in a % character
[00:44:42] <Cork> oh wait, ie9+ actually does
[00:44:54] <Cork> anli: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent
[00:44:56] <anli> Maybe converting that string back and comparing is a good idea
[00:46:09] <Cork> anli: for the arrow keys its the key variable
[00:46:40] <anli> key? not event.key, I presume
[00:46:46] <Cork> yes
[00:46:49] <Cork> event.key
[00:46:51] <anli> undefined
[00:46:58] <Cork> yes
[00:47:10] <Cork> unless your in ie9 or ie10 it's not supported as far as i know
[00:47:17] <Cork> (yet)
[00:48:25] <xec_> you're*
[00:48:28] <xec_> :D
[00:48:39] <Cork> damn...
[00:48:41] <Cork> sorry
[01:21:41] <freannrak> what method would one use to get the closest class element on the same DOM "level"? I've got bunch of inputfields+links and I need the link to interact with only the specific element (the one above the link).
[01:22:14] <Cork> dom level?
[01:22:19] <Cork> you mean siblings?
[01:23:19] <freannrak> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/9mLma/9/
[01:23:51] <freannrak> closest() isn't what I need in this case
[01:23:54] <freannrak> but you should get the idea
[01:24:03] <Cork> ?.siblings @ freannrak
[01:24:04] <bot-t> freannrak, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[01:24:23] <Cork> or if you want the next one see ?.next and see ?.nextAll
[01:24:23] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[01:24:24] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[01:24:53] <freannrak> cool, this is why I love IRC :=). Thanks Cork.
[01:26:10] <xec_> looks like you want .prev() instead of .next() though
[01:28:23] <freannrak> xec_: yup, you are correct sir. http://jsfiddle.net/9mLma/13/ working now :=).
[01:29:56] <xec_> freannrak: i realise this is just a testcase, but <input> and <a> are not valid children of <tbody> - and omitting the "var" makes "fullID" a global
[01:33:43] <Nephro> Is it possible to store data retrievable by .data() from HTML?
[01:35:28] <systemfault> ?
[01:36:29] <_pash> hello, .delay doesnt seem to work with removeClass, what may be the problem?
[01:37:00] <systemfault> .delay only works with animations.
[01:37:19] <systemfault> For anything else… use setTimeout
[01:37:59] <systemfault> Hmm… perhaps you could hack delay to work the way you want..
[01:38:14] <Cork> well you can use delay
[01:38:33] <Cork> though it needs you building a queue and triggering it
[01:38:42] <Cork> ?.queue
[01:38:43] <bot-t> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[01:39:00] <Cork> normally it's much simpler to just use a timer
[01:39:34] <_pash> thanks!
[01:39:49] <systemfault> Cork: haha http://jsfiddle.net/pcHN6/
[01:40:03] <systemfault> le hax0r
[01:41:31] <Cork> ah, the new promise structure
[01:41:35] <Cork> didn't think of that one
[01:42:10] <Cork> the queue comment was based on my fiddling with it back in 1.4 actually
[01:42:43] <systemfault> Even sexier: http://jsfiddle.net/pcHN6/1/ :P
[01:44:35] <Cork> systemfault: it break the chaining though http://jsfiddle.net/pcHN6/2/
[01:44:53] <Cork> (and yes i know why)
[01:46:44] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/pcHN6/3/ Chain with promises
[01:47:11] <Cork> ya, but then it's not a chain anymore
[01:47:40] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/pcHN6/4/ :/ Well… a different kind of chain
[01:48:15] <Cork> ah, you chain the returned callbacks
[01:48:26] <Cork> ya, that works (not exactly pretty though)
[01:48:54] <shoky> you dont need the .promise() inside the .then callback
[01:48:59] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pcHN6/5/
[01:49:23] <Cork> don't think you need the return either
[01:49:26] <systemfault> Even better
[01:49:49] <systemfault> Hmm, I think the return is mandatory though..
[01:49:52] <Cork> not really cause the then callbacks isn't waiting for eachother
[01:50:00] <Cork> you just build the animation queue
[01:50:19] <Cork> na, it works just fine without return
[01:50:46] <shoky> well that's no fun though, you might as well .slideUp().fadeIn().fadeOut() :P
[01:50:50] <Cork> though like i said, if you do things not animated in some of the then callbacks they will end up out of order
[01:52:07] <Cork> systemfault, shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/pcHN6/6/
[01:52:59] <systemfault> Cork: Yeah.. but if you add "return", it should work properly.
[01:53:07] <shoky> yup
[01:53:46] <Cork> interesting... so it does
[01:56:58] <Cork> either way i still think this looks better http://jsfiddle.net/pcHN6/8/
[01:58:33] <systemfault> But with promises, one of the step could be an XHR… or a setTimeout or anything else :P
[01:58:36] <shoky> yap. i like the 'next' argument better tho
[01:58:55] <Cork> systemfault: so can it with queue
[01:59:04] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[01:59:08] <Cork> just move the dequeue into the done callback
[01:59:48] <systemfault> Yeah… but with promises, you don't need a done callback :P You'd do: return $.ajax({ url: '….', type: "LOL"});
[02:00:18] <Cork> systemfault: ya, but you would have to wrap every call you make
[02:00:21] <systemfault> Or even use when to start 2 xhrs at the same time.
[02:00:40] <systemfault> return $.when($.post(…), $.get(..));
[02:01:08] <systemfault> I find promises to be insanely powerful :P
[02:01:55] <Cork> it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good fit for everything :)
[02:02:41] <systemfault> My whole life is promise-based :(
[02:02:48] <Cork> O_o
[02:06:24] <sandip_>  difference between 1.x and 2.x
[02:06:51] <Cork> 2.0 is 1.9 without the legacy ie support
[02:07:56] <systemfault> It basically means that 2.x is unusable in the real world :(
[02:08:13] <Cork> for the next 9 months ya
[02:08:27] <systemfault> Cork: How come?
[02:08:40] <Cork> winxp dies on april 2014

[02:41:41] <mogaj> How to make content when clicked a link coming in jquery UI dialog to show as in page page itself ?
[02:42:13] <xec_> i didn't have a headache, then i read mogaj's message :(
[02:42:30] <Cork> :D
[02:42:58] <Cork> mogaj: try rephrase that please
[02:43:12] <Cork> first half and second half contradicts each other
[02:46:26] <mogaj> I have a link like "search". when i click that link, right now, i am getting a Jquery UI dialog with search form. I would like to change that in such a way that when i click that "search" link the search form should show in the page itself like in a "div". How can i do this?
[02:46:52] <Cork> mogaj: did you ask this yesterday too?
[02:47:05] <Cork> i feel i recognize the question
[02:47:35] <Cork> mogaj: you need to find the event listener that puts it in a jquery ui dialog
[02:48:10] <mogaj> Cork : Sorry for bothering i could not use that click function you mentioned yesterday been trying all day could now figure out
[02:48:44] <Cork> mogaj: you have to alter the click handler
[02:48:45] <mogaj> * Could not figure out
[02:49:01] <Cork> as it is what prevents the normal action
[02:49:16] <Cork> you can't prevent the override of the default action
[02:49:27] <Cork> just exclude that from happening
[02:52:44] <Dirkos> I made a modal that i can call on an object $('#foo').modal();. But right now i want to open an URL in a modal. What is the best way to do that?
[02:53:22] <Cork> Dirkos: you can't really make html content modal
[02:53:30] <Cork> you can fake it to some degree
[02:53:53] <Cork> but adding a cover screen and killing events
[02:53:58] <Cork> *by
[02:54:11] <Cork> but you can't make it freez code
[02:54:39] <Cork> you will have to make it as a callback solution
[02:54:51] <Dirkos> Uhmm well right now the object (div for example) will be cloned in the modal
[02:55:06] <Dirkos> but how todo this with an url instead of that div
[02:55:24] <Cork> ajax fetch the content and add it in the div
[02:55:29] <Cork> or an iframe if its cross domain
[02:56:11] <Dirkos> Cork: but then i need to write that ajax call every time... I'd rather see something like modal({url: 'foo/bar', width: 200});
[02:56:20] <Dirkos> if u know what i mean
[02:56:29] <Cork> sure
[02:56:40] <Cork> that would just mean you need to do the ajax call in the plugin
[02:56:44] <Dirkos> but how do i call that on something that is not yet there
[02:56:57] <Cork> you would still have to have a container
[02:57:12] <Cork> or you could do $.modal and create it dynamically
[02:57:35] <Cork> $.modal = function() {}; vs $.fn.modal = function() {};
[03:08:20] <Dirkos> Cork: thanks. And what about doing it like $("<div>").modal();
[03:08:26] <Dirkos> or is this evil?
[03:08:57] <Cork> no not really
[03:13:14] <Dirkos> ok thanks :) probadly more easy to write though
[03:39:26] <Abhijit> Cork, i was disconnected in the morning. can you please tell me why if (evt.id == divid) do not work in your code? http://jsfiddle.net/t6E2G/1/
[03:39:43] <Abhijit> i want to compare json data with my data hence i am doing ==
[03:41:32] <Cork> Abhijit: try something like console.log('divid: ' + divid + '; evv.id: ' + evt.id)
[03:42:31] <Abhijit> Cork, i tried it. both contians valid data. e.g. while looping through it comes to point where divid = evt2 and evt.id=evt2 but still if condition fails
[03:42:58] <Cork> where are you doing the == check?
[03:43:21] <Abhijit> instead of if(evt.id && divid)
[03:43:43] <Cork> where did you have the json example?
[03:44:28] <Abhijit> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5731583/

[03:51:18] <JSM87> Hi guys, any idea why this doesnt work http://pastebin.com/ZKwJ2U4R   # It will work if there are no line breaks so obviously it is that causing the issue. How can i get arround this?
[03:51:59] <Cork> JSM87: the server writing the content in the string needs to escape the line breaks
[03:52:09] <Abhijit> Cork, why did you commend //if (sleft >= tleft && sright <= tright) ?? thats the main condition to check
[03:52:21] <Cork> JSM87: $("#ch_2").val("test\n\n123\n\n456");
[03:52:35] <Cork> Abhijit: cause i don't have the needed information to get it working
[03:52:37] <JSM87> Cork: I tried what you have and that wont work, hence im confused as that is the normal wau
[03:52:41] <Cork> Abhijit: i just hacked it together
[03:52:46] <Abhijit> ok
[03:53:00] <Cork> JSM87: define "won't work"
[03:53:46] <Abhijit> Cork, so its the custome getJSON that solved the error?
[03:54:05] <Cork> Abhijit: no, that again is just to get the code i had working
[03:54:11] <Cork> it emulates the $.getJSON call
[03:54:14] <Abhijit> ok
[03:54:23] <JSM87> Cork: DOESNT WORK = $("#ch_2").val("test \n \n123 \n \n456"); ###### DOES WORK = $("#ch_2").val("test 123 456");
[03:54:37] <Abhijit> Cork, so if everything is same why it do not work in my lamp?
[03:54:49] <Cork> JSM87: what is #ch_2 ?
[03:54:58] <JSM87> Cork: this is taking place inside $(function() { if it  makes any differnce
[03:55:01] <Cork> Abhijit: cause it is something else breaking
[03:55:07] <JSM87> Cork: #ch_2 is a textarea.
[03:55:10] <Cork> JSM87: it doesn't

[04:02:04] <anixet> I have a very limited of knowledge of jQuery. I've heard from some experts that it's slow. Is it true?
[04:02:22] <Cronoh> not slow enough to not use it
[04:02:23] <anixet> *Slow in comparison to other libraries like Dojo, etc.
[04:02:32] <anixet> @Cronoh: I see
[04:03:34] <Cork> anixet: later jquery versions has been getting quite a bit of performance increase
[04:03:58] <Cork> anixet: and performance is often more about the code you write then the jquery lib
[04:04:17] <Cork> (or plugins you use)
[04:06:53] <anixet> Ok ... thank you for the inputs! Feels better to hear good news about jQuery.
[04:07:16] <anixet> I've been using it since about an year.
[04:07:44] <Cork> anixet: for example if you trigger reflow in the page, what lib you use to generate the content doesn't really matter
[04:08:00] <Cork> cause the reflow is amongst the most expensive thing the browser does
[04:08:25] <Cork> so writing and working with the page correctly is MUCH more important then the lib
[04:08:53] <Cork> one point that might be valid is the download size of the lib
[04:13:07] <anixet> That gives me a better understanding of jQuery ...
[04:13:39] <anixet> or programming for the browser in general

[04:28:54] <Cork> you have to write each lever on it self in javascript

[04:36:59] <Abhijit> Cork, i have "stime":"9:00am" in my json i done var ti = this.stime now how can i get only that "9" seperately?
[04:37:20] <Cork> anixet: there isn't really a "right way"
[04:37:43] <Cork> anixet: commonly it's just the nick with a comma or colon after
[04:37:59] <anixet> Cork:
[04:38:04] <anixet> alright ...
[04:38:33] <Cork> Abhijit: so you're server doesn't send the correct header it seams
[04:38:47] <Cork> Abhijit: make sure the server sets the application/json mimetype
[04:38:53] <Abhijit> :o
[04:39:21] <Abhijit> Cork, that whole stime is the correct json. i am just asking about how to split?
[04:40:04] <Cork> Abhijit: ah i misunderstood
[04:40:15] <Cork> Abhijit: .split(':')[0]
[04:40:24] <Abhijit> ok
[04:40:56] <Cork> js> print('10:32am'.split(':')[0])
[04:40:59] <b-ot> Cork: 10
[04:44:48] <innociv> Anyone use netbeans? I configured sftp on it, but I don't see where to upload the file.
[04:50:43] <Abhijit> Cork, i read all valued of json and put id field in array. and still if(arr[k]==divid) do not work
[04:51:26] <fabioportieri> debug it?
[04:51:30] <Cork> arr[k]??
[04:51:40] <Abhijit> arr is array
[04:51:48] <Abhijit> k is var of for loop
[04:51:58] <Cork> are you giving arr the result from each?
[04:52:03] <Abhijit> yes
[04:52:18] <Cork> so try if(k.id==divid)
[04:53:42] <Abhijit> Cork, i am assigning arr values inside $.getJSON in another location and then i am checking arr[k] == div in another for loop
[04:54:10] <Cork> uh.. so your using a for loop now...
[04:54:22] <Abhijit> :-D
[04:54:23] <Cork> ok then i don't have a clue about what happens as i haven't seen the code
[04:54:44] <Cork> *you're
[04:54:58] <Abhijit> Cork, this is the code http://paste.ubuntu.com/5732335/
[04:55:08] <Cork> Abhijit: fiddle please
[04:55:20] <Abhijit> ok
[04:55:20] <Cork> and when you're at it, make it a running one
[04:59:32] <Acrack> hi anyone using foundation here ?
[05:01:06] <Abhijit> Cork, how can i upload json in jsfiddle?
[05:01:21] <Cork> Abhijit: you can't upload it
[05:01:29] <Hooloovoo> Acrack: i have like... once. why?
[05:01:35] <Abhijit> ok
[05:01:38] <Cork> if you want to go the extras mile you can use the /echo/json interface
[05:02:01] <Acrack> Hooloovoo:   im trying to use the ajax reveal of foundation
[05:02:08] <Cork> (check the ajax thingy on the left)
[05:02:08] <Acrack> doesn't seem to work good :x
[05:02:28] <Hooloovoo> Acrack: oh i have no idea about the js libs that comes with it. sorry :/
[05:02:36] <Acrack> oki

[05:27:58] <Thomas12> Is there a way to get the "body" content from a jquery result? The result contains the whole HTML page (from doctype till </html>)
[05:39:08] <Noeble> Hi, I am appending elements to this page and for some reason the elements dont expand the sourinding structure. The last elements will hide bellow the footer. When I minimize and maximize the browser it gets fixed
[05:39:12] <Noeble> anyone know why?
[05:39:15] <Noeble> http://teglerfilm.se/?page_id=4
[05:39:33] <Noeble> err behind the footer, not bellow
[05:43:37] <tylercipriani> Noeble: adding elements as in the anchor tags you've got going on?
[05:44:01] <Noeble> tylercipriani: I append <li> elements to the <ul> with jquery
[05:44:48] <tylercipriani> Noeble: dobule-check your structure—looks like you've got this going: <ul> <a><li></li></a></ul>
[05:44:53] <tylercipriani> which could cause problems.
[05:45:06] <Noeble> tylercipriani: you mean that <a> around an <li> is bad?
[05:47:32] <tylercipriani> Noeble: it's not great, browser still displays it obviously, but you're depending on a browser's ability to display non-standard markup an <li> should be contained by a <ul><ol> or <menu> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li
[05:48:21] <Noeble> tylercipriani: point taken, could the be issue..
[05:48:41] <Noeble> tylercipriani: whats best practise to make an <li> clickable then? bind a click event to it?
[05:49:38] <moldy> hi
[05:49:44] <tylercipriani> Noeble: the more typical structure is <ul><li><a></a></li></ul>
[05:49:58] <tylercipriani> Noeble: with the <a> tag set as a display: block;
[05:50:24] <moldy> i am playing with jquery.hotkeys. it seems to execute my handler no matter *which* key i press. any idea what i could be doing wrong?
[05:52:10] <Noeble> tylercipriani: mm aight thx
[05:54:39] <tylercipriani> moldy: do you have code we can look at?
[05:54:54] <moldy> tylercipriani: sure, one moment...
[05:56:08] <moldy> tylercipriani: http://pastebin.com/af1DZR4w
[06:03:12] <Noeble> tylercipriani: I removed the anchor but the page still suffers the same issue
[06:06:52] <seutje> moldy: the third parameter on the .on() method is extra data being sent to the handler
[06:07:50] <seutje> moldy: in this case, the handler is being called for any keypress event, and it is passed this 'ctrl+h' string, so you'd still need to manually check if the key that was pressed (and the modifier) match that extra bit of data you're sending (you will have to convert it though)
[06:08:00] <moldy> seutje: oh. ok, thanks
[06:08:06] <seutje> but I guess hotkeys handles the translation
[06:08:56] <seutje> moldy: oh wait, it appears I'm not up to speed with the new hotkeys plugin
[06:09:11] <moldy> seutje: hm, yes
[06:10:17] <seutje> moldy: hmz, this should work, maybe try attaching it to the body instead of the document
[06:10:36] <seutje> no wait, there's an example that uses document :/
[06:11:13] <moldy> seutje: ahh. the plugin is not getting loaded in my case
[06:11:26] <seutje> also note that certain browsers won't fire keypress events for stuff like ctrl+w and other built-in shortcuts
[06:11:28] <moldy> so what i see is the behaviour without the plugin being present at all
[06:12:12] <moldy> seutje: now it works as expected :)
[06:12:47] <seutje> even other browsers will execute your code and then execute native behavior, regardless of whether or not the event was preventDefaulted
[06:13:11] <moldy> yeah, i know
[06:14:25] <Noeble> Hi, I am appending elements to this page and for some reason the elements dont expand the sourinding structure. The last elements will partly hide behind  the footer. When I minimize and maximize the browser it gets fixed. Any ideas why?

[06:19:14] <_jo_> G'morning #jquery.
[06:25:04] <greg0> Hello, I have an issue.  http://test.dayat.net/testgps2/  to see what I'm talking about drag the "test" box out and below the "filtry" box then resize it.  Do you see how it pushes all the other divs down?  What is this called?  I'd like to remove it but I don't even know what to google.
[06:26:22] <Aqeel> Can't seem to figure out which css class handles the suggestion box in jquery autocomplete. No matter what I do with margin and padding the box sticks to the input box. Any idea?
[06:28:37] <Aqeel> I strongly believe it's one of these .ui-menu, .ui-autocomplete, .ui-widget, .ui-front but it might be a position property
[06:28:59] <Aamir> @Aqeel the position of list is done using JS
[06:29:27] <Aamir> If you want to change the position of the list, use css with !important may be.
[06:29:29] <Aqeel> Aamir: it's not the position of the list i'm looking for, it's the background box, the container
[06:30:02] <Aqeel> I want some space between it and the input box, right now it's stuck to it
[06:30:06] <Aamir> Aqeel:  what container?
[06:30:45] <Aqeel> Aamir: I'll send you a link to a screenshot
[06:31:14] <Aamir> Aqeel:  http://cl.ly/PO88
[06:31:22] <Aamir> ?
[06:32:19] <Aqeel> Aamir: yeah that's exactly it
[06:32:32] <Aqeel> but there's nothing in the css named element.style
[06:33:04] <Aqeel> Aamir: which class do I have to target
[06:33:08] <Aamir> Aqeel:  come on. ement.style refers to inline css
[06:33:49] <Aqeel> Aamir: ok, which element are you targeting?
[06:34:28] <Aamir> Aqeel:  in your css file, target any css class and than use !important like with it e.g. http://gyazo.com/9f66cde8f5805628669aa7b000fbec63
[06:34:41] <paulvd> can any jquery pro tell me which effect is this template using, for the content area, when you click on the menu items http://8thdec.com/html/
[06:35:05] <Aamir> Aqeel:  in your css, do this:   .ui-menu { top: 53px !important; }
[06:35:47] <Aqeel> Aamir: there we go, .ui-menu is what i was looking for, thanks. Going to test it
[06:36:02] <Aamir> paulvd: its using .animate by increasing the height and width
[06:36:22] <Aamir> paulvd: http://8thdec.com/html/js/scripts.js hava look
[06:36:39] <Aamir> Aqeel:  cool
[06:37:12] <paulvd> Aamir: but the content is also changing..
[06:37:21] <paulvd> so its adjusting the height and width of all the divs?
[06:37:52] <Aamir> paulvd: the image is there http://gyazo.com/d0a8420360e6a144b389e41368aac374
[06:38:15] <Aamir> paulvd: on hover, its using .animate to increase the height and width
[06:39:09] <paulvd> on click i meant
[06:39:14] <Aamir> ah i c
[06:39:26] <paulvd> you will see the content boxes to the left
[06:39:41] <Aqeel> Aamir: thanks. I was trying it earlier without the !important bit. the code works, however it's jumping to the top of the page, way up higher than the input box which I have in the center of the page.
[06:40:14] <Aamir> Aqeel:  use a correct value. top: 53px was just to show u
[06:40:55] <Aqeel> Aamir: thnaks again Aamir
[06:41:04] <Aamir> paulvd: if you inspect it while clicking, you can see that the content is being appending to #content
[06:42:27] <paulvd> Aamir: yeah i can see that, I am just wondering which effect this is where the content box goes small and then expands...
[06:42:52] <Aamir> paulvd: the pages are preloaded http://gyazo.com/8429a7320b5af7d203fc1d2c2f3576e2 and again js is animating by giving it height and width
[06:43:06] <wolfehr> when doing $(html).find('element').addClass() can anyone think why this won't work?
[06:43:07] <Aamir> open inspector and the click links, you can see the values changing.
[06:43:21] <paulvd> or maybe something similar to this
[06:43:32] <wolfehr> all other operations on $(html) work fine (adding elements, etc.) addClass just won't seem to apply
[06:43:37] <Aamir> wolfehr: use jQuery('html').find...
[06:44:16] <wolfehr> Aamir, don't $ and jQuery both reference the same namespace?
[06:44:32] <Aamir> I meant to say that enclose html in quotes
[06:44:41] <Aamir> you can use either $ or jQuery
[06:45:00] <wolfehr> Aamir, I was simplifiying, html is  html returned via an ajax call, it's then wrapped $(html)
[06:45:33] <Aamir> wolfehr: than cannot answer your question unless you make a simple @demo
[06:58:39] <paulvd> thanks Aamir, I am thinking of doing some alternate effect there
[06:58:43] <paulvd> Aamir Khan
[06:58:59] <Aamir> cool :)
[07:21:51] <pierlooqup> Hello! Can someone help me figure out why this queue / dequeue inside a for loop won't work as expected? http://jsfiddle.net/gwpdY/
[07:22:59] <pierlooqup> I'm pretty sure it's a matter of context (i.e. the var i is globally scoped) but I just can't seem to find out how to have i resolve itself within the queue
[07:23:48] <xec_> pierlooqup: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide55
[07:25:30] <pierlooqup> xec_: thanks!!!
[07:25:35] <pierlooqup> http://jsfiddle.net/gwpdY/2/
[07:25:55] <xec_> yep, dirty fix, but it works ;)
[07:26:06] <pierlooqup> oh
[07:26:20] <pierlooqup> now you made me curious… what would be the clean solution then?
[07:27:42] <xec_> depends what you're really doing. i rarely need a for loop
[07:28:50] <pierlooqup> mmm it's a bit of a long story
[07:29:09] <pierlooqup> i'm creating an animation queue for raphaeljs to draw a series of lines one after each otehr
[07:30:41] <xec_> pierlooqup: is 10 just an arbitrary number, or are you looping through a collection?
[07:31:02] <pierlooqup> it's the length of a coords array
[07:31:46] <xec_> pierlooqup: http://jsfiddle.net/gwpdY/3/
[07:32:41] <xec_> pierlooqup: or the jquery way http://jsfiddle.net/gwpdY/4/
[07:34:02] <xec_> reads a lot cleaner than the IIFE imo
[07:34:25] <pierlooqup> oooh
[07:34:26] <xec_> apart from the silly array creation :D
[07:34:30] <pierlooqup> i'm so stupid
[07:34:38] <pierlooqup> why didn't i think of using each
[07:34:44] <pierlooqup> thanks xec_
[07:34:48] <xec_> yw
[07:56:14] <Lost123> hi i have a datepicker with a field, the field does get the class "HasDatepicker" but datepicker does not appear. Please check http://tinyurl.com/mr94ubp click next and reach step 4 and check Exp date field
[08:03:28] <c4ptnh00k> Lost123: your link doesnt work for me, but This happened to me once. If you are refering to the element you are trying to add the datepicker to as "this" it will not work due to incorrect scopping of this
[08:10:04] <DeltaHeavy_> I'm building a web app. It was suggested to me on another channel to have the server, pass JS the dynamic values, and have jQuery generate the actual dynamic bits of HTML for the page. Is this a good method of doing things? What are it's advantages?
[08:16:04] <Bloomberg> hello guys!!
[08:16:22] <Bloomberg> How can I get the id of a element if I'm using with onclick event?
[08:16:39] <Bloomberg> some like  ::  <ul onclick="my_function()">
[08:17:00] <Bloomberg> Because with $(this).attr('id');
[08:17:04] <Bloomberg> doesn't works
[08:18:48] <mfranz> what linux distro do people use if you want something light and just for some jquery app like GUI with webpage and then jquery page, I am looking for something to run a custom jquery app, and the computers are a bit slow and windows 7 is really hogging some resources?
[08:19:32] <flcl1> Bloomberg:  ="javascript:my_function($(this))"
[08:19:56] <flcl1> to pass clicked element as first param
[08:22:19] <clh> folks .. I'm having trouble processing an ajax call that wireshark shows to be returning correctly.  PHP is on the server-side, but my ajax response always ends up calling back to the error() handler.  also, firebug shows no data in the response.  Object { readyState=4, status=404, statusText="error"} is what my request object looks like even though both wireshark and firebug show a 200 OK.
[08:22:22] <clh> any ideas?
[08:22:43] <clh> I've tried with version 1.9.1 and 2.0.2
[08:22:52] <kzurawel> clh: got a jsfiddle of your code?
[08:23:39] <clh> kzurawel: I can't share the URL, but will pastebin the code and the http response from wireshark
[08:26:21] <clh> kzurawel: http://pastebin.com/jQGEbyqM
[08:28:57] <kzurawel> clh: looks pretty normal to me. Is this code being run from mydomain.com as well?
[08:29:23] <clh> y .. wireshark is showing the request as being ok.
[08:30:10] <steemar> hi
[08:30:19] <Bloomberg> Really I'm changing the content of a div with the property .replaceWith()
[08:30:43] <steemar> hi amir
[08:30:54] <kzurawel> clh: Only other possibility is that what's being sent in the response is not valid JSON
[08:31:04] <kzurawel> clh: It's a 200, but jQuery still calls error handler in that case
[08:31:29] <clh> I used a json validator and reported it was ok, but I will explore that a bit closer
[08:31:53] <kzurawel> clh: Good luck, always annoying when you have this kind of bug.  :)
[08:32:01] <clh> indeed, tx :)
[08:33:29] <fishhead2567> question: I am using jquery ui to create a slider that expresses True/False. But I want the slider to start centered so that the user must choose one before they can continue. How might I do this?
[08:38:52] <ak5> hi guys, I am trying to use jquery mobile in a cordova-cli application, but $.ajax and similar methods make my app crash, does anyone know anything about this:?
[08:38:53] <Bloomberg> But now I cannot get the element with a function
[08:39:38] <_rgn> I have a jQuery-like array like this: http://d.pr/i/QFbT -- why doesn't .find('.second') work?
[08:40:05] <mapper99> can anyone explain this JavaScript syntax for me?  ( i%1 === 0 )
[08:40:20] <BillCriswell> _rgn: I think you want .filter('.second')
[08:40:28] <kzurawel> mapper99: that's an odd way of writing it, but I believe that's testing if i is an integer
[08:40:31] <dwarder> i have a js file wich is loaded with <script> tags, i has .click bindings on certains #ids, if thouse #ids were "refreshed" ajax query (.empty().append("html with thouse ids")), how do i restore this .click bindings, so that this new html reacted as it was loaded upon full page load?
[08:40:49] <kzurawel> mapper99: i%1 means "remainder after dividing i by 1"
[08:40:57] <BillCriswell> mapper99: the modulus.
[08:41:24] <dwarder> or should they still work?
[08:41:32] <dwarder> *must
[08:41:51] <_rgn> BillCriswell: cheers, just what i needed
[08:42:23] <kzurawel> dwarder: you'll need to replace .click() with .on(). Check the jQuery API docs (api.jquery.org)
[08:42:50] <kzurawel> dwarder: Just need to make sure that your .on is on something that will not be reloaded, but contains the things that need to respond to clicks.
[08:42:59] <mapper99> thanks kzurawel/BillCriswell - makes sense now...it is used in a count loop to count by twos instead of one
[08:43:21] <archfool> How do I detect if a jquery plugin is already loaded?   for example detecting if jquery itself is loaded I do a:  if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined')
[08:43:34] <archfool> (my plugin specifically is NivoSlider)
[08:44:06] <BillCriswell> mapper99: I see it used mostly with  i % 2 === 0 to tell if something is even or not.
[08:44:15] <kzurawel> archfool: because you want to make sure it's loaded before doing something with it?
[08:44:33] <archfool> yes.  Or prevent it from loading/parsing multiple times. :)
[08:44:39] <dwarder> kzurawel: the problem is that $('#id').on() , this <div id="id"> will be reladed
[08:45:20] <kzurawel> dwarder: Right. So you'll need to do something like $('#id').parent().on('click', '#id', function() {}) (although you'd just use the parent's selector instead of .parent())
[08:45:44] <kzurawel> archfool: Usual solution for that is AMD modules. http://requirejs.org/
[08:46:06] <kzurawel> archfool: you can list plugins' dependencies, it'll make sure they get loaded in the right order and only once
[08:46:28] <kzurawel> archfool: Actually  http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html   is better
[08:46:48] <archfool> cool.   My problem is an antiquated web app I'm maintaining.  And it can have multiple sections of varying types.  Want to load only the module needed... but not more than once. :)
[08:47:01] <jedimind> require is pretty solid, but chances are you might need something even bigger that accomodates routing and other things
[08:47:04] <jedimind> like backbone or angular
[08:47:32] <kzurawel> archfool: jedimind's right, your use case sounds more like something you want the server to take care of
[08:47:45] <Bloomberg> This is right?
[08:47:46] <Bloomberg> onclick="clickInvisibleDiv('+$(this)+')"
[08:47:59] <jedimind> Bloomberg "right' is a subjective term in this case
[08:48:03] <archfool> The server code is crap. ;)  Sadly easier to do in JS
[08:48:07] <DeltaHeavy_> Hey, I'm making a web app that has different menu's with different buttons that are in groups, and more or less do the same task, just changing different parts of an object. Do I make an event for each grouping of buttons, or is there a better way to do this?
[08:48:25] <Bloomberg> is good
[08:48:26] <Bloomberg> ?
[08:48:41] <jedimind> no its bad, you should not be doing onclick="" anything
[08:48:48] <jedimind> because its bad practice to hard code events into your html
[08:49:05] <Bloomberg> So what do you suggest me?
[08:49:10] <jedimind> also i have no idea what clickInvisibleDiv does
[08:49:20] <jedimind> i suggest you spend several weeks learning how to write javascript properly
[08:49:24] <jedimind> but that's probably unlikely
[08:49:35] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: .on() is your friend. If your menu is .nav-menu, you could do $('.nav-menu').on('click', 'li', function() {}) and then use $(this) inside the handler to get what's actually clicked
[08:49:36] <jedimind> in respect to the syntax of your onclick, it seems fine, you have no syntax errors
[08:50:14] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: That way you only have one event handler taking up memory / slowing down the browser  :)
[08:52:17] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: How do I change different parts of that object then? I have a .click() event already but I have a fairly complex object to change with varying dimensional depth.
[08:52:23] <abes> Question: what is the best approach to create and append a copy of every <input> of type="password" with a modified ID? (i.e. if I have input filed of type password with placeholder="some placeholder" I want to append an input of type text right after with value being that of the elements placeholder)
[08:52:42] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Can you give me an example of what you mean?
[08:52:53] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: Sure, one moment. On the phone atm =X
[08:53:34] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: Or here: http://decorgroupinc.com/store/builder/archmouldings/
[08:53:39] <DeltaHeavy_> I'm making something like this, but more complicated
[08:54:21] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: the left-side menu?
[08:54:47] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: Yep
[08:55:10] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: So you're presumably making some kind of ajax call when the user clicks one of those links
[08:55:32] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: You just need a way to store the data that changes in the link itself. Could be based on an ID, could be a data attribute
[08:55:54] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: One sec
[08:56:12] <clh> weird .. so my json ajax works if I specify jsonp, but not json
[08:56:29] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Then in your handler (using .on()), make use of that info with something like $(this).attr('id').
[08:56:46] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: Sorry one sec, I'm not using AJAX when I press those buttons.
[08:56:58] <DeltaHeavy_> All the information is gotten on page load
[08:57:22] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Ok. It's still the same idea... you'll use some information stored in the links to determine what part of the page to show/hide, or whatever it is you're doing
[08:58:39] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: That's what I was doing before, but I'm unsure how to get it in the right spot of my 'item' object. In the one I'm building now I have my ID's for the buttons layed out like so: #style-type_square
[08:58:46] <DeltaHeavy_> In hopes of being able to change
[08:58:52] <DeltaHeavy_> item['style']['type'] = square
[08:58:56] <DeltaHeavy_> However I've been unsuccessful.
[08:59:17] <chilvers1_> anyone know of a way to sign out of a page that's using digest authentication (even if its developer tools only)?
[09:00:48] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Ok, so you want to take something like "#style-type_square", which gets clicked, and use that to find something in the array?
[09:01:55] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: $(this).attr('id') will get you "style-type_square", then it's just string manipulation from there. Plain old JS .split('-') and .split('_') to get the parts
[09:03:42] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: What if it's just #material_oak, or #dimension-display-width_20 ?
[09:05:25] <DeltaHeavy_> This is the poitn I was at yesterday. I found a solution but it was overly complex and I was reccommended to go about it another route
[09:06:59] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: My gut would say get the id, then .split('_') to convert it to a key and value in an array. So you'd get something like ['dimension-display-width', '20']
[09:07:25] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: After that, it all depends on how your array is set up for what other splits you need to do
[09:07:34] <DeltaHeavy_> But item is ['dimension']['display']['width'] and I want to keep it that way =X
[09:07:47] <DeltaHeavy_> Seems hacky otherwise
[09:08:25] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: That's fine. Just means you'll need to take the key/value array's [0].split('-'), which will give you the key as an array: ['dimension', 'display', 'width']
[09:08:44] <DeltaHeavy_> Plus, parts of that object contains arrays, so that's not possible
[09:08:57] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Ouch. I feel for you.  :)
[09:09:13] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: you out there today?
[09:09:21] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Yesh.
[09:09:36] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: How would I do that in code though? I know how to split all that and manage all that, but how do I get it to do what I wanted to do.
[09:10:13] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Where you asking last week about diff between a <button> and <input type="button"> and whether it defaulted to a submit?
[09:10:49] <BillCriswell> I thought the default type attribute for a button would be "button" but it's "submit".
[09:11:12] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Hacky, but would probably work - assuming 'key' is an array of the key parts: var thisItem = item; for (var i = 0; i < key.length; i++) { thisItem = thisItem[key[i]]; }
[09:11:23] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: You'll end up with item['dimension']['display
[09:11:29] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Ok just was reading about some blogs and couldnt remember if you ever found your answer
[09:11:30] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Oops. You get the idea
[09:11:45] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Ah I did. Thanks though1
[09:11:57] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: np :P
[09:12:14] <DeltaHeavy_> I already have the code done to get a variable like ['dimension', 'display', 'width']
[09:13:08] <Bloomberg> how can I pass a data by  ::  onclick="javascript:my_function(some)"
[09:15:41] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: So how do I then assign that value a new item?
[09:15:41] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: http://jsfiddle.net/QFpDq/
[09:19:07] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Ah I see, you're using an object. Give me a minute...
[09:24:36] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: I had a solution before, but it wasn't too elegant and I was advised to rework everything
[09:32:06] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: The hard part is that you have a variable-length key. If you have a max depth in the object, you could write a function that takes that many arguments plus a value and does the set.
[09:32:28] <DeltaHeavy_> kzurawel: That seems hacky though =/
[09:32:29] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: Like for 2 elements in the key array:  function doStuff(x1, x2, val) { item[x1][x2] = val; }
[09:32:34] <DeltaHeavy_> I wanna do this really well and reuse the code
[09:32:38] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy_: I know. Trying to find a more general-purpose solution.
[09:32:57] <DeltaHeavy_> Thanks, I'm being suggested in #webtech to use .data(), and render the page with jQ
[09:33:28] <kzurawel> Data attributes are usually a good solution, but you might need a lot of restructuring
[09:33:59] <DeltaHeavy_> I'd rather do that and learn how to do it awesome like
[09:38:59] <FrenlySeal> -.-
[10:03:46] <pinholecamera> hey folks, how goes? i'm trying to get the width of a <p> that's inline-block with no set width, just based on how much text is in it. finding a fair amount of stuff on stack overflow but all of it seems to return zero
[10:04:45] <pinholecamera> it's all centered inside of a relatively positioned block element, not sure if that's why i'm having difficulty getting the width. console logging the width on document load()
[10:09:10] <Saaether> pinholecamera: you have a sample up some where?
[10:11:11] <snorti> pinholecamera: show us a fiddle
[10:12:01] <pinholecamera> i'll do that. i'm curious to see what happens if i take this out of the context of the site at large anyways
[10:13:38] <pinholecamera> you know, actually, i think there's too many styles/scripts running to do it justice, so i'll just drop this: http://goo.gl/G9bPW
[10:14:12] <pinholecamera> it's the .slide-header nav, .slide-header nav p stuff i'm trying to get a width for
[10:14:45] <pinholecamera> have tried width, innerWidth on $(".slide-header nav"), $(".slide-header p:first"), etc
[10:15:11] <pinholecamera> i'm dropping this in a $(window).load() to make sure everything is loaded and rendered first
[10:16:46] <Saaether> $(".slide-header nav").width() give me a width
[10:17:30] <pinholecamera> Saaether: huh, what browser, and curious, what's the width?
[10:17:37] <Saaether> chrome
[10:17:42] <Saaether> 1920
[10:18:20] <pinholecamera> ahh... what happens if you do nav p:first though?
[10:18:39] <Saaether> 315
[10:18:40] <pinholecamera> .slide-header nav p:first that is
[10:18:42] <pinholecamera> damn
[10:18:43] <pinholecamera> okay
[10:18:49] <pinholecamera> so this apparently doesn't work in firefox.
[10:19:54] <pinholecamera> well actually, i'm getting 0 in chrome as well
[10:20:03] <pinholecamera> huh
[10:20:23] <pinholecamera> it must be a scoping problem
[10:21:33] <pinholecamera> damn, it seems that $("nav p.title").width() works in the console, but not in the code. that's interesting, it's supposed to be running after full render/load
[10:25:11] <Saaether> hmm that is odd
[10:25:42] <pinholecamera> i assume it's working for you in console?
[10:25:55] <Saaether> ya
[10:26:03] <Saaether> but i see where its failing in the window load
[10:26:47] <pinholecamera> it can get the nav parent container width, but not the nav on load even
[10:26:58] <xertion> Having issue with relative/absolute URL in javascript files. On my localhost the ajax call to "ajax/class.myclass.php" works fine on all subpages. When I moved it to my server it tries to call domain.com/page/ajax/class.myclass.php"
[10:27:06] <xertion> Why is this? How do I solve it?
[10:27:13] <xertion> I've set the baseurl in <head> if that matter.
[10:29:12] <pinholecamera> Saaether: yeah, it seems to work in both browsers on console
[10:30:39] <obert> xertion: baseurl should add domain.foo in front of relative urls
[10:30:57] <xertion> It does for all files I call in my <head> and from my HTML
[10:31:30] <obert> xertion: also check htaccess
[10:31:38] <xertion> however when I call $.post('ajax/class.designer.php' it tries to call http://www.domain.com/the-page-im-on/ajax/class.designer.php
[10:31:40] <pinholecamera> if there's one thing i'm good at, it's finding weird things like this
[10:31:54] <xertion> even if my baseurl is set to domain.com/
[10:32:49] <xertion> obert: in my htaccess i've set RewriteBase /
[10:33:01] <Saaether> pinholecamera i think its because of the  $slideHeader.css('display', 'block') after your first call to onWinResize
[10:33:14] <Saaether> put it before
[10:34:07] <pinholecamera> Saaether: yep, that'll do it. thanks
[10:34:57] <abes> Question: does the $(this) object ever change through the function if I don't touch it, but make other new objects equal to it? (i.e. var fakeField = $(this);) Now, if I change the ID attribute of fakeField, the ID attribute of $(this) has changed as well. I want to keep the original element in tact ($(this)) while being able to manipulate "clones" of it, such as fakeField.
[10:35:43] <Saaether> use .clone()
[10:36:50] <Saaether> `api clone @ abes
[10:36:51] <b-ot> abes: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[10:43:30] <abes> Saaether: does that still give me the flexibility of changing its values? I need to basically make a copy of each input of type password and append (after()) the new field to the existing one...
[10:45:52] <Saaether> clone makes a copy of what ever you cloned, that is independent of the original
[10:47:53] <Kev-> I'm using jquery-ui... And whenever I run this in console, the page scrolls down quite a bit and displays the dialog there... $('<div>').html('nammi').dialog() why? :)
[10:51:54] <_rgn> I wrote a jquery plugin that animates two elements one after another, all good. now there's possibilty that the plugin is triggered while it's still animating, what's the correct way to manage a queue of animations that is not tied to a specific element (as jQuery#queue seemes to work)? should I just roll my own this.queue = []?
[10:56:39] <_rgn> hmm, might have an idea, I think only need to store the latest "trigger" and run that once the current animation is complete; there should never have to be a queue longer than one item
[11:08:45] <Centurion_1> Hello, can please someone help me?
[11:10:11] <relipse> can someone look at my plugin and tell me how to make the code better: https://github.com/relipse/jquery-dialogPrompt/blob/master/jquery.dialogPrompt.js
[11:14:29] <murftown> Centurion_1: did you ask a question yet or just asking in general
[11:14:53] <paulvd> two same slider on two different pages, http://cool-quotes.org/vevideo/testimonials/ and http://cool-quotes.org/vevideo/
[11:15:06] <paulvd> but the testimonials one has a funny out?
[11:16:00] <rmurphey> Centurion_1: please do not PM
[11:22:01] <Kev-> I'm using jquery-ui... And whenever I run this in console, the page scrolls down quite a bit and displays the dialog there... $('<div>').html('dialogtext').dialog() why? :)
[11:30:09] <BillCriswell> Kev-: Is it styled properly? Sounds like it may be a CSS issue?
[11:34:07] <DavidScherer> I have a typeahead that I tie to Live textboxes. When the user clicks the button to add the textbox, the typeahead works, when I do it when the page loads, the typeahead does not work.
[11:34:07] <DavidScherer> Ideas?
[11:40:51] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[11:40:51] <DavidScherer> Holly crap this place is a join/quit nightmare!
[11:40:51] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with fancybox?
[11:40:54] <shoky> DavidScherer: make your irc client hide joins/quits/etc
[11:40:58] <DavidScherer> Shoky I think I almost have to.
[11:40:59] <shoky> doesn't make sense to be in this channel if you don't, imo
[11:40:59] <Bloomberg> What happens to this shit?
[11:41:02] <DavidScherer> I still can't figure out why this stupid typahead won't bind to this textbox, it makes no sense.
[11:41:03] <shoky> DavidScherer: and as to your question, make a jsfiddle or testcase somewhere that shows the problem
[11:41:31] <DavidScherer> shoky: jsfiddle won't let me use Bootstrap's typeahead, I tried.
[11:42:02] <shoky> DavidScherer: link to what you've tried..
[11:42:37] <shoky> anyways didn't realize you're talking about bootstrap, donno it much myself
[11:43:55] <DavidScherer> shoky: I can't find anything on google. But, as soon as I $('#element').append(input_html); I call $('.InputClass').typeahead({source: item_ist}); which works when the user clicks a button.
[11:44:44] <DavidScherer> But when it's not taken place after the button is clicked, (like when editing and I generate the rows automatically) the typeahead doesn't trigger.
[11:49:52] <shoky> DavidScherer: still need a testcase. typeahead works fine in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Enhbf/
[11:50:50] <DavidScherer> shoky: I Actually think I might be retarded, the Source I'm using isn't defined when I'm trying to bind the typeahead.
[11:51:02] <shoky> owie
[11:52:21] <DavidScherer> shoky: So, the source I use is defined and instantiated in a script right after the script that actually does the binding.
[11:52:49] <DavidScherer> Is there a way, short of rearranging the order, to wait for the variable to be defined and instantiated before running the code above?
[11:54:45] <shoky> DavidScherer: not really.. unless you want to keep checking if its defined with a setInterval or something, but you dont want that. sounds like you need to restructure some
[11:55:24] <DavidScherer> I'm just worried that putting the dynamic script below the hard-script will jack stuff up, but it shouldn't.
[11:55:56] <DavidScherer> I get paranoid when it comes to jQ/JS since I'm a PHP developer and try to keep my distance from front-end stuff.
[11:56:34] <DavidScherer> (the dynamic script is defined by the controller, whereas the hard-script is constant.)
[11:56:38] <shoky> it's hard for me to say anything really without seeing what you're talking about
[12:03:48] <shoky> welp if you're gonna make someone want to jump off an overpass.. they deserve compensation :P
[12:03:51] <cwatson> or their family
[12:03:55] <shoky> ;]
[12:07:31] <DavidScherer> shoky: We offer life insurance in our benefits program. It's all good. ;)
[12:08:53] <cwatson> DavidSchere: Cause we know that replaces a loved one.

[12:09:18] <Joenie> Hi Guys, can someone help me with this: http://pastebin.com/ju6FSzbz I need to change it that it gets the tweets from the hashtag (hash:) instead of the user. But can't find how to change this.
[12:10:45] <abes> Question: any alternative to .append for IE8? (since it doesn't work in IE8)
[12:11:15] <shoky> abes: it should work fine
[12:11:26] <Joenie> Hi Guys, can someone help me with this: http://pastebin.com/ju6FSzbz I need to change it that it gets the tweets from the hashtag (hash:) instead of the user. But can't find how to change this.
[12:13:13] <abes> shoky: it doesn't actually.... this.appendChild(e) - Breaking on JScript runtime error - Unexpected call to method or property access.
[12:13:16] <DavidScherer> cwatson: You've taken a statement clearly meant to be humorous and sarcastic completely out of context. As your reward: People die, roughly 2.5/second, get over it. As for "loved ones," well, since 'love' is a mere concept there's nothing to replace.
[12:13:39] <cwatson> DavidScherer: I'm actually joking.
[12:13:53] <cwatson> Pretty sure IRC is famous for that.
[12:14:22] <shoky> abes: reproduce the issue in jsbin.com or something
[12:15:30] <Joenie> wow
[12:16:08] <cwatson> Maybe it will get quiet.
[12:22:17] <Joenie> Someone who can help me? :-/
[12:22:52] <shoky> Joenie: that's too much code to look at, and most of it seems unrelated to your question
[12:23:05] <Joenie> true it's just the first part
[12:23:50] <Joenie> This better? http://pastebin.com/ZaEfLkb6
[12:24:05] <kzurawel> Joenie: You'll need to find the right settings in the Twitter API. https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1
[12:24:19] <Joenie> Yes I know what it sould be but just can't get it working
[12:25:56] <kzurawel> Joenie: You're making a request for user_timeline - which is only for actual users. If you want a hashtag, I think you need to call search/tweets  https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/search/tweets
[12:26:30] <kzurawel> Joenie: Also Twitter now requires authentication for most requests - this http://www.queness.com/post/8567/create-a-dead-simple-twitter-feed-with-jquery is out of date
[12:27:57] <Joenie> is this one working?

[12:28:24] <kzurawel> Joenie: I took a quick look, that looks like it should work (and I think it has settings for doing a search instead of getting a user's tweets)
[12:29:08] <ShrtSong> I am truly stumped. I have the following selector: $('.checkStatus > span') and I use .removeClass() then .addClass('icon-edit') right after it.  It removes no classes at all yet has no trouble adding one!  Anyone have any idea why this might be?
[12:30:18] <shoky> ShrtSong can you jsfiddle it
[12:32:42] <danfromuk> Hi, How can I confirm if a checkbox is checked?
[12:33:09] <shoky> danfromuk:  .is(':checked') works
[12:33:40] <ShrtSong> Ugh. jsfiddle doesn't have anything for fontawesome. -_-
[12:33:50] <shoky> ShrtSong: "External Resources"
[12:33:55] <kzurawel> ShrtSong: You could just use .attr('class', 'icon-edit') instead
[12:34:56] <Bloomberg> Someone could help me with a problem in fancybox?
[12:35:23] <shoky> bad question
[12:35:44] <Bloomberg> Later of the first click and the close it show me " .fancybox is not a function "
[12:36:01] <ShrtSong> Problem is, I need to find a publicly accessible css of font-awesome. -_-
[12:36:24] <shoky> ShrtSong: is it inherent to the issue
[12:36:52] <shoky> you can also just copy/paste the css ..
[12:37:29] <Bloomberg> My temporally solution is when I close the window set the option reload
[12:37:39] <Bloomberg> But now I need fix it with another way
[12:38:57] <ShrtSong> Well it's working in jsfiddle. I have no idea why it won't work in my application
[12:39:03] <danfromuk> shoky: I've tried that but it doesnt want to work. Its always false.
[12:39:05] <danfromuk> http://pastebin.com/nYK0yryv
[12:40:24] <Kev-> I'm using jquery-ui... And whenever I run this in console (or when run by an event), the page scrolls down quite a bit and displays the dialog there... $('<div>').html('dialogtext').dialog() why? :)
[12:40:43] <ShrtSong> k. Found the problem. But... it's just messed up
[12:40:47] <shoky> danfromuk: .prop('checked', true/false)  to check/uncheck it
[12:41:11] <ShrtSong> Apparently using jquery-ui is causing problems.
[12:42:24] <danfromuk> shoky: the IF statement is still always FALSE
[12:43:41] <ShrtSong> Anyway thanks.
[12:43:46] <shoky> ShrtSong: you're right.. jquery-ui extends removeClass, seems it disables calling it with no arguments
[12:44:00] <xhoy> http://jsfiddle.net/2mtf5/ <<
[12:44:11] <xhoy> how can i best select the '.aantal' div?
[12:44:25] <relipse> i'm using dlg$.dialog("option", "position", "center"); to center a dialog but it is not centered vertically, only horizontally
[12:44:26] <shoky> oh jquery-ui 1.10 seems to fix it
[12:45:03] <xhoy> $().closests doesnt seem to do the trick..?
[12:46:32] <abes> Question: I have a .each loop going through all instances of given element while keeping count (boxCount++) - now, iside of my .each function, I have other event triggered function that use the counter value (boxCount). The problem I am experiencing is that the value used in the event triggered situation is the final count value rather than given count value at the time that function was created
[12:46:32] <abes> - any thoughts?
[12:46:33] <abes> thanks
[12:47:06] <Joenie> wow even with that I'd not get it working :(
[12:47:07] <xhoy> define it the first time outside te loop :)
[12:47:14] <xhoy> or give it alogn when you do the function call
[12:47:24] <shoky> xhoy: first of all, it's closest  not closests.  2nd, closest is for searching UP the dom
[12:48:10] <abes> xhoy: i do define it well before the loop - not sure what alogn is

[12:48:44] <xhoy> shoky: ah
[12:48:53] <xhoy> abes: why dont you pass it along
[12:49:08] <xhoy> shoky: the documentation wasn't realy clear because you have parents asswell
[12:49:31] <shoky> xhoy: it's pretty clear to me
[12:50:13] <MarcGuay_> Hi folks.  I have some jquery that checks a hidden element for is(:visible).  I also have a media query that displays this element, at which point I expect the is(:visible) switch to return true - but it doesn't.  Any ideas?
[12:50:22] <shoky> abes: by the time your event is triggered, the loop is already finished and so boxCount has its final value
[12:51:05] <abes> shoelessone: exactly
[12:51:07] <shoky> abes: .each provides an index as first argument to the callback, can you use that instead
[12:51:15] <abes> shoky: exactly*
[12:53:26] <BillCriswell> MarcGuay_: I just set up a quick demo and it works here: http://jsbin.com/ezecos/1/edit
[12:53:32] <abes> shoky: perfect! i got it working as expected. thanks
[12:53:39] <abes> xhoy: thanks for your effort
[12:53:44] <shoky> np
[12:55:42] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ezecos/2/edit Eh, quick update.
[12:57:31] <BillCriswell> MarcGuay_: Ah... don't think there is a :is().
[12:57:51] <BillCriswell> Tht's probably why yours wasn't working lol
[12:58:07] <MarcGuay_> BillCriswell: Sorry, you mean that the code is just invalid?
[12:58:26] <BillCriswell> MarcGuay_: Are you trying $('div:is(visible)') ?
[12:58:38] <MarcGuay_> $('#fold-value').is(':visible')
[12:58:50] <BillCriswell> Oh ok, yeah that should work just fine.
[12:58:57] <BillCriswell> My demo shows it working.
[12:59:52] <MarcGuay_> BillCriswell: Not for me in Chrome/XP.
[13:00:21] <MarcGuay_> Seems to be some chrome funniness if you google..
[13:00:31] <MarcGuay_> Maybe I'll just check the css display value.
[13:00:33] <BillCriswell> Chrome OSX is working here.
[13:00:58] <BillCriswell> BrowserStack time

[13:01:08] <BillCriswell> deepy: http://jsbin.com/ezecos/2/edit
[13:01:25] <BillCriswell> deepy: You can resize between the panels.
[13:01:30] <BillCriswell> Or the whole window.
[13:02:10] <deepy> just let me start the right browser first
[13:02:45] <Daniel1809> Hello, can someone help me with a jquery task for the university??
[13:02:58] <deepy> In Chrome on Win7 nothing prints in the console for me
[13:03:18] <deepy> okay I lied, I got 40 trues in the chrome console
[13:03:22] <cwatson> Daniel1809: Don't ask to ask. Just ask.
[13:03:29] <BillCriswell> deepy: Make the window really small.
[13:03:32] <BillCriswell> Should get a false.
[13:03:37] <BillCriswell> Well, a few of them.
[13:03:49] <BillCriswell> MarcGuay_: I just tried it on Chrome XP and got true and false.
[13:04:23] <deepy> I managed to make it 0px, then I got a flase
[13:04:25] <deepy> false even
[13:04:26] <sekyms> Is there an easy way to get qUnit to ignore the document.ready function?
[13:04:26] <MarcGuay_> BillCriswell: Ah, I misunderstood jsbin, I was resizing the whole window.
[13:04:48] <MarcGuay_> I'll have to dig deeper, thanks.
[13:04:56] <BillCriswell> MarcGuay_: You can. As long as the HTML Pane meets the media query
[13:07:00] <Daniel1809> I have created a HTML form with a submit button in an overlay (jquery).

[13:34:09] <nicetry> Question about a responsive bootstrap navbar collapse.  Is there a way to have each item in horizontal navbar collapse one at a time as the page changes size? Instead of all of them at once once a size is reached?
[13:34:23] <relipse> it is not vertically aligned
[13:35:44] <shoky> relipse: bad link
[13:35:44] <relipse> oh seriously?
[13:35:44] <relipse> crap he didnt publish it
[13:35:44] <BillCriswell> nicetry: So like... only show half the items on a min sized screen?
[13:35:45] <BillCriswell> on a mid sized*
[13:35:55] <nicetry> BillCriswell: exactly - once you reach a point at which things stop fitting, it starts moving items from one end or the other into that 'collapse' icon drop down
[13:36:04] <nicetry> but only moving what it needs to move, not all of them.
[13:36:14] <houser> why is this wrong? 	console.log($(".createeventbox div[class*='tab_step'")); I get syntax error
[13:36:23] <systemfault> Missing ]
[13:36:57] <relipse> why not juste use hasClass()
[13:37:02] <houser> ahh doh hehe
[13:37:03] <houser> thx
[13:37:13] <systemfault> relipse: *= === contains
[13:37:16] <shoky> prolly has tab_step_1 tab_step_7
[13:37:23] <Zzaichik> houser: missing square bracket
[13:37:26] <mikes___> how would I add a callback to this function? function typewriter(){	 // typewriter  	var htmlStr = jQuery(".original-title").html();	 	jQuery('#target').teletype({ 		text : [ htmlStr ]	     });  }

[13:37:37] <relipse> $(".createeventbox div").hasClass('tab_step')
[13:37:51] <shoky> relipse i think you mean $(".createeventbox div.tab_step") :P
[13:37:56] <systemfault> relipse: see shoky's comment
[13:38:06] <relipse> oh i see
[13:38:11] <kzurawel> relipse: That gives you true/false, no? Doing a log on the selector would give you the actual elements
[13:38:42] <mikes___> full code here: http://jsfiddle.net/maikunari/KgvLv/
[13:38:48] <nicetry> BillCriswell:  Interesting - that's awesome but also sort of halfway there
[13:38:48] <relipse> yeah but *=tab_step could give you blah_tab_step as well
[13:39:05] <nicetry> BillCriswell: because I'd still want to get at the hidden links by clicking on the right most element
[13:39:22] <BillCriswell> nicetry: hard time visualizing. =/
[13:39:26] <TechnoCat> i have a Deferred object that produces a bunch of Deferred objects before resolving. this has resulted in a pyramid of doom for me and I can't help but feel I am missing something.
[13:39:32] <jax> can somebody check this? i have the feeling this can be done more elegantly: https://dpaste.de/QU3Eo/
[13:40:24] <nicetry> BillCriswell: hmmmm well I gotta run - I'll try to come back later and articulate better - thanks for the code, I'll see if I can make what I'm thinking from it :)
[13:41:17] <BillCriswell> jax: You could do $('#same_address_div').toggle( val.length ? true : false ); maybe?
[13:41:56] <relipse> didnt know toggle accepted boolean
[13:42:18] <jax> val is 1/0
[13:44:00] <relipse> jax: just use the .toggle() like bill said
[13:44:33] <jax> this doesn't seem to work:
[13:44:49] <jax> https://dpaste.de/qfyW5/
[13:44:58] <jax> then again, not sure why val.length is being used
[13:45:08] <relipse> https://dpaste.de/Lrjao/
[13:45:48] <jax> thanks!
[13:45:54] <relipse> jax: bill was just giving an example, if you are using '1' and '0' then use mine
[13:46:18] <relipse> easy peasy, harder questions please
[13:47:06] <jax> can i also use this when the page loads? i.e something like $("#same_address_div").toggle(($('input[name="same_address"]').val() == '1'));
[13:47:27] <relipse> probably but wrap it in $(function(){ });
[13:48:05] <BillCriswell> jax: Just trigger it.
[13:48:09] <BillCriswell> jax: This can work: http://jsbin.com/odiwad/2/edit
[13:48:53] <relipse> BillCriswell: will that mess up if there are multiple 'change' events?
[13:49:03] <BillCriswell> relipse: True.
[13:49:13] <jax> looks evil ;)
[13:49:39] <relipse> actually triggering change is not always bad, i've used it before when loading form values up

[13:50:50] <shoky> oh the thing i was just editing

[14:02:41] <moot_12> The service opens the text file in the browser, but the ajax call returns an error
[14:03:44] <BillCriswell> StackOverflow has been pissing me off lately.
[14:05:56] <shoky> moot_12: if your "metrics" server doesn't support CORS (and you're calling it from a different origin) then that won't work..
[14:06:31] <shoky> moot_12: you can't load data from a different origin unless the server supports it (e.g. cors or jsonp)
[14:06:50] <houser> how can i find out if  which of the classes div[class*='tab-step'] a given element is child of?
[14:07:14] <houser> and get a reference to that parent
[14:07:27] <shoky> moot_12: er actually i see you're getting a 200 status. are you sure there isn't some other error? what if you try in another browser
[14:08:07] <houser> nevermind
[14:08:23] <shoky> BillCriswell how so
[14:08:58] <BillCriswell> Not sure the questions I answered ever get looked at by anyone besides the asker lol
[14:09:01] <BillCriswell> shoky: ^^
[14:09:49] <shoky> mmm that sounds like a weird thing to be pissed about. especially as you're not sure :P
[14:10:05] <BillCriswell> shoky: I use "pissed" very loosely haha
[14:10:22] <BillCriswell> I'm just sad I don't have as many points as I'd like. =(
[14:10:28] <moot_12> shoky: Sorry I forgot to mention.. It does not work in other browsers too. :(
[14:11:18] <shoky> BillCriswell ah so you see others get 800 points on one answer, heh
[14:11:56] <shoky> moot_12:  what does the browser's devtools network tab show
[14:12:05] <BillCriswell> shoky: Yeah. I just recently got back into answering questions on it in hopes potential employers might think I'm kind of smart.
[14:12:08] <shoky> moot_12: and what do the other browsers have to say
[14:14:19] <shoky> BillCriswell: is it known that employers look at it?
[14:14:45] <BillCriswell> shoky: Nope. Just in case, though haha
[14:14:57] <BillCriswell> I should really be putting code on github as well.
[14:15:43] <shoky> commit a few commas to jquery, you can show em you're a contributor
[14:16:19] <BillCriswell> shoky: do you think they'd let me?!
[14:16:22] <BillCriswell> Haha
[14:16:40] <shoky> if you find the comma-lacking spots!
[14:17:51] <moot_12> shoky: all the scripts and the text file are downloaded and have status 200 on the Net tab.
[14:18:20] <moot_12> shoky: tried on firefox, chrome and IE
[14:19:47] <shoky> moot_12: and you're loading from a different origin, yeah?
[14:20:16] <dylan9o4_> hey guys, anybody available?
[14:20:45] <shoky> moot_12:  oh.  Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation.
[14:21:00] <shoky> ?async @ moot_12
[14:21:01] <bot-t> moot_12, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[14:21:07] <dylan9o4_> I was wondering how to get these to work, it is a simple example of binding 2 events before the element is created... http://jsbin.com/ecufat/1/edit
[14:21:30] <moot_12> shoky: i know this doesnt help because the Get status is 200, but i tried with datatype 'script' and it reads the text and goes to success, but says that the text is undefined
[14:21:39] <systemfault> I found a single legitimate use for sync ajax :P
[14:21:43] <shoky> moot_12:  remove the async: false
[14:22:18] <shoky> systemfault: share with us ;p
[14:22:43] <moot_12> shoky: tried async true and also tried by removing it, but still the same error. :(
[14:22:55] <moot_12> Should i try  $.support.cors = true;
[14:23:00] <shoky> moot_12:  no
[14:23:14] <shoky> moot_12:  does your metrics server support cors or not?
[14:23:40] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: http://jsbin.com/ecufat/2/edit
[14:24:37] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: damnit
[14:25:08] <BillCriswell> You're not actually binding to the element before it's created, you're just waiting for the element to be created...
[14:25:19] <systemfault> shoky: sending something to the server on the onbeforeunload event
[14:25:43] <shoky> systemfault: ah i thought something besides that ;p
[14:25:45] <moot_12> shoky: This is my local box. I guess i need to enable cors on tomcat. Let me try the corsfilter
[14:28:20] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: I'm not asking for you to sort through all the code here or give a whole bunch of input but can you tell me why only the .blur event isn't working here? http://jsbin.com/oyewam/13/edit
[14:28:21] <shoky> moot_12: you see the ajax response ok in the network tab though?
[14:28:38] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: thanks regardless though
[14:28:45] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: I see you've asked for help before.
[14:28:47] <moot_12> shoky: yes. status 200 for the GET request
[14:28:55] <shoky> moot_12: not the status code, the actual response
[14:28:59] <dylan9o4_> yupp
[14:29:54] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: input[list seems off?
[14:30:42] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: input[list=whatever] would look for <input list="whatever"> which doesn't seem like something you'd want.
[14:30:46] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: it is changed from id to list on click because a datalist is being appended to it. you can inspect it to confirm it is correct
[14:30:47] <moot_12> shoky: I dont see the response tab itself on the GET request. Just the params and headers tab
[14:31:38] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: ensure by clicking the input, then inspecting it of coarse
[14:32:14] <shoky> moot_12: donno man this all sounds weird.. would be best if you could set up a live link so we can see..
[14:33:24] <relipse> how do i add jquery-ui to fiddle/
[14:33:26] <moot_12> shoky: alright. i'll try the corsfilter. if it doesn't work,  i'll set up a link for you to check.
[14:33:40] <moot_12> shoky: Thanks a lot for the help. Appreciate it!
[14:34:19] <shoky> relipse: choose jquery  and check jquery-ui ?
[14:35:05] <relipse> shoky: there is no jquery-ui checkbox?
[14:35:05] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: weird, right?
[14:35:12] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: It's not weird.
[14:35:21] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: The bind blur won't work because you're applying it before you change id to list.
[14:35:39] <shoky> relipse:  did you choose an old jquery version
[14:35:44] <relipse> oh got it
[14:35:45] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: I thought bind was for live elements
[14:35:49] <relipse> 10.x didnt have it
[14:35:58] <dylan9o4_> i.e. dynamically created
[14:36:02] <shoky> oh
[14:36:09] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: You want .on
[14:36:16] <shoky> didnt notice they added 1.10
[14:36:25] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: I tried that before bind
[14:36:57] <dylan9o4_> same result
[14:37:30] <relipse> why isn't my library loading: http://jsfiddle.net/hnSFP/2/
[14:37:43] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: that's why I find it strange
[14:39:14] <shoky> moot_12:  oh, are you loading the page from the filesystem? not on a webserver?
[14:39:17] <relipse> shoky: any idea?
[14:39:33] <shoky> moot_12: if so, that might be it. (i mean the original page, not the ajax url)
[14:40:04] <shoky> relipse: Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.github.com/relipse/jquery-dialogPrompt/master/jquery.dialogPrompt.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[14:40:11] <shoky> relipse:  remove the dot between raw and github
[14:40:17] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: http://jsbin.com/oyewam/16/edit is more what you want.
[14:40:21] <shoky> rawgithub.com ftw
[14:41:20] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: I know you didn't want other input... but keep in mind clicking on an element isn't the only way to get into it.
[14:43:53] <dylan9o4_> BillCriswell: yes I will change to focus eventually this is just for testing purposes. thanks!
[14:44:02] <BillCriswell> dylan9o4_: Welcome.

[14:51:51] <hugo_moss> im trying to get the computed height of a div that is filled with content, but whose width is not explicitly set. i'm using outerheight in the $(window).load method, but the height is printing as 0
[14:52:22] <hugo_moss> sorry height is not set
[14:52:34] <relipse> ahhh my stomach hurts
[14:52:48] <optiqal> can't you just do $('#mydiv').height()
[14:52:57] <optiqal> on doc ready or something like that?
[14:53:05] <hugo_moss> i do but its printing 0 as the height
[14:53:18] <hugo_moss> the height is not explicitly set, i want the rendered height
[14:53:37] <optiqal> I thought that returned the rendered height.  Hmm...
[14:53:48] <hugo_moss> i tried outerHeight as well
[14:54:03] <optiqal> if you do it in the console after the page is loaded, does it still return 0?
[14:55:56] <hugo_moss> yea its printing the same thing in console
[14:56:00] <hugo_moss> as 0 with height
[14:56:06] <hugo_moss> but 6 as outerheight
[14:56:17] <hugo_moss> when i inspect in google chrome, it says the computed height is 878px
[14:56:56] <arxwn> hello, can someone tell me which is better on terms of speed? $(this).find('a').length or $(this).has('a').length
[14:57:38] <optiqal> @hugo - Do you have a link that I could see?  I may be able to help you
[14:57:57] <hugo_moss> ok, now instead of the direct div, i used it on a div wrapper
[14:58:04] <hugo_moss> and its giving me the correct height
[14:58:06] <hugo_moss> 878px
[14:58:17] <hugo_moss> what would cause that?
[14:58:53] <optiqal> that's strange.  maybe the div is not taking up the full height for some reason.  Is something absolutely positioned inside it?
[15:00:56] <moot_12> gma
[15:02:48] <hugo_moss> the div is display block, and so are the contents inside (or inline). the wrapper is display block containing that div, and then this div is contained inside a div that is position fixed
[15:03:10] <hugo_moss> basically inside bootstrap modal
[15:03:19] <hugo_moss> its just a modal body
[15:04:24] <optiqal> yeah, that's strange.  I am not sure what it would do that.  If you can throw up a link, let me know.  I am curious
[15:04:47] <hugo_moss> ok
[15:04:51] <hugo_moss> ill set up a jsfiddle
[15:05:08] <hugo_moss> and right now the wrapper on load is alerting 0
[15:05:23] <hugo_moss> but after using the console once everything is loaded
[15:05:40] <optiqal> are the contents loading after the wrapper?  Maybe you need to bind the event on load of inner contents
[15:05:41] <hugo_moss> what if i used $( the_div).load
[15:05:52] <hugo_moss> instead of window.load
[15:05:56] <optiqal> yeah, you can do that
[15:06:02] <optiqal> or you can do $(div).ready
[15:08:29] <usulix> hugo_moss, maybe hook your alert(div.height) into $('#myModal').shown()
[15:08:44] <hugo_moss> ok
[15:09:26] <usulix> orry technically.... $('#myModal').on('shown', function(){//echo});
[15:09:42] <usulix> *sorry
[15:10:41] <relipse> How do you guys reconcile when you need to inject PHP code inside of javascript?, do you create a .js.php file so it processes it in php first?
[15:12:10] <optiqal> @relipse - You cannot do that.  Javascript is executed client-side on the clients computer and PHP is executed on the server before HTML or JS is served
[15:12:27] <usulix> relipse, too much of a headache for me... I just put it inline if I need to create js from PHP. If you have a REALLY BIG js to build... I could see doing it js.php, but otherwise,  inline it.
[15:13:07] <optiqal> @relipse - Maybe I misunderstood.  Do you mean you want to write js code with PHP?
[15:14:37] <wroathe> optiqal: You can do that. Your web server has to be configured to preprocess .js.php files. It's not widely used in practice though.
[15:15:06] <relipse> i need to use PHP to generate some of the js code, if that is the case it seems like the only way of doing it is to do it inline and not fetch a separate .js file
[15:15:37] <wroathe> relipse: Use a <script> tag
[15:15:56] <relipse> yes but good practice says to separate all js from the html
[15:16:33] <wroathe> relipse: Good practice within reason :) In some cases the use of a <script> tag can be hard to avoid
[15:16:33] <pedda> hi all
[15:16:48] <usulix> @goodPractice #moreLikeGuidelines.....
[15:16:53] <optiqal> can you not do if(this_condition) { echo "<script src='this_script . . .} else { echo "<script src='that_script }
[15:17:07] <relipse> optical: no, but you can use js to dynamically laod a script
[15:17:29] <wroathe> relipse: What specifically are you trying to do
[15:17:38] <pedda> i need some help setting the class of my body tag accordingly to a class representing a color of a sliders current slide
[15:18:06] <krainboltgreene> I have an empty <td></td>, but $("td").filter(:parent) still gets it. What in the world is going on?
[15:18:25] <relipse> you mean ':parent'
[15:18:30] <krainboltgreene> Yeah, sorry.
[15:18:57] <wroathe> Are you trying to say filter(':empty')
[15:19:36] <krainboltgreene> I'll jsfiddle it, momento.
[15:19:40] <wroathe> Oh
[15:19:41] <wroathe> Actually
[15:19:50] <wroathe> I know what's wrong. You probably have an empty text node inside of it
[15:20:38] <wroathe> krainboltgreene: and actually you could write it like this $('td:parent')
[15:20:47] <krainboltgreene> Same thing.
[15:20:56] <krainboltgreene> Hold on.
[15:21:22] <krainboltgreene> http://jsfiddle.net/gWXXb/
[15:21:41] <krainboltgreene> If parent was working, then Canada should have a + sign next to it.
[15:22:05] <krainboltgreene> With query, whoops: http://jsfiddle.net/gWXXb/2/
[15:23:01] <krainboltgreene> Sorry, here we go: http://jsfiddle.net/gWXXb/3/
[15:23:02] <optiqal> @krainboltgreene - You do not have classes setup
[15:23:19] <wroathe> http://jsfiddle.net/gWXXb/2/
[15:23:22] <krainboltgreene> Notice the + signs even on empty <td>
[15:23:25] <wroathe> krainboltgreene: http://jsfiddle.net/gWXXb/2/
[15:23:38] <wroathe> Oh
[15:23:38] <wroathe> nvm
[15:24:24] <krainboltgreene> I figure it's me screwing up, not jquery, but I seem to be following it to the letter.
[15:25:56] <krainboltgreene> So, anyone got any ideas?
[15:26:54] <nsanden> any recommendations for a good ajax grid
[15:27:42] <wroathe> krainboltgreene: http://jsfiddle.net/gWXXb/6/
[15:27:50] <wroathe> Empty text nodes
[15:28:04] <krainboltgreene> Man what.
[15:28:14] <krainboltgreene> wroathe: So what classifies an empty text node?
[15:28:31] <optiqal> @krain you are targeting with .city, .state, etc but you do not have those classes setup
[15:28:34] <optiqal> in the html
[15:28:43] <krainboltgreene> See the updated versions, optiqal.
[15:29:40] <krainboltgreene> Or just help me understand why jquery thinks <td></td> isn't empty.
[15:31:03] <wroathe> krainboltgreene: http://jsfiddle.net/gWXXb/7/
[15:31:10] <wroathe> Notice the difference?
[15:31:19] <relipse> shoky: would you be willing to change your HOSTS file to test something?
[15:32:15] <wroathe> You can either ensure that no newlines or tabs get printed between the tags in your markup, or you can use a callback for filter
[15:32:26] <shoky> relipse: in about 20 min, sure
[15:33:23] <wroathe> $('.locations .city').filter(function (i) { var $this = $(this); return $this.children() > 0; });
[15:33:35] <wroathe> $('.locations .city').filter(function (i) { var $this = $(this); return $this.children().length > 0; });
[15:33:38] <wroathe> sorry
[15:38:25] <nsanden> any recommendations for a good ajax grid
[15:39:28] <wroathe> ajax grid?
[15:40:14] <nsanden> right, table grid - pagination, sorting, etc
[15:40:53] <wroathe> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2007/05/30/tables-and-data-grids-with-ajax-dhtml-javascript/

[15:41:27] <relipse> what is that symbol that looks like >> ?
[15:43:21] <wroathe> relipse: bit-shift right
[15:43:34] <relipse> umm?
[15:43:55] <snover> I think he is looking for “right double-angle quote”
[15:44:10] <wroathe> snover: ?
[15:44:28] <snover> did I say something confusing?
[15:44:54] <wroathe> snover: >> This is a quote in Javascript?
[15:45:13] <snover> it was not a javascript question.
[15:45:27] <wroathe> snover: >> This is a quote in jQuery?
[15:45:39] <snover> dude
[15:45:41] <snover> how dense
[15:45:41] <snover> are you
[15:45:42] <snover> »
[15:45:44] <snover> right double angle quote
[15:45:54] <wroathe> dude
[15:45:55] <snover> he asked about a symbol
[15:45:57] <wroathe> pretty dense
[15:46:00] <snover> not a programming construct
[15:46:13] <wroathe> I misread and thought he was asking about the operator.
[15:46:17] <wroathe> Stop being a jackass on irc
[15:46:24] <snover> IT’S THE ONLY THING IRC IS GOOD FOR
[15:46:28] <snover> well, that and cyber
[15:46:39] <snover> but i can just use aol chat rooms for that
[15:46:53] <wroathe> Dude. 200 hours of free internet ftw.
[15:47:37] <pedda> how can i access the var: current of a slider?
[15:48:05] <wroathe> pedda: What slider are you using?
[15:48:11] <pedda> if i inspect the object i see an init function.. if i click on the arrow it shows me <function scope> where i can see the needed var
[15:48:22] <pedda> i use some page transitions of codrops
[15:48:39] <pedda> http://tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/
[15:48:58] <pedda> there is a PageTransitions object i can log to console..
[15:49:15] <pedda> but how can i access the current var ?
[15:49:28] <pedda> PageTransitions.current doesn't work
[15:50:53] <pedda> wroathe?
[15:51:57] <wroathe> I'm looking at this
[15:52:15] <wroathe> This doesn't look like re-usable code to me
[15:52:25] <wroathe> Just seems like a script they wrote to demonstrate these page transitions
[15:52:30] <pedda> it's not intended
[15:52:35] <pedda> correct
[15:52:42] <pedda> i'm about to adjust it..
[15:53:21] <wroathe> that current var is wrapped in a closure
[15:53:24] <wroathe> It's not exposed
[15:53:33] <pedda> should it require a complete rewrite of the script? i'm missing some private and public
[15:54:11] <pedda> yepp.. that's what is wrong..
[15:54:43] <wroathe> there's a self-invoking anonymous function being executed and the object that it returns exposes the init() function
[15:54:48] <wroathe> Which is the only thing you have access to
[15:55:09] <wroathe> That said
[15:55:24] <wroathe> You could use the .pt-page-current class it provides
[15:55:32] <wroathe> $('.pt-page-current')
[15:55:43] <pedda> yepp
[15:55:48] <pedda> got it working :)
[15:55:49] <wroathe> Which will give you a reference to the current slide
[15:55:57] <shoky> relipse: yo
[15:56:10] <pedda> http://hilfe.trotzdem.wikipeter.org/ trotzdem:preview
[15:56:41] <relipse> shoky: can i delay you for a bit, i switched to YUI as a work-around
[15:57:28] <shoky> relipse: mm k, so ill be back in another 20 min or so :P
[15:57:28] <relipse> if i do $('addon_transactions_subcategory').val(subcat); and the value doesnt exist, what happens?
[15:57:39] <shoky> oh or what did you mean by delay me
[15:57:39] <relipse> haha shoky, take your time, i'll find you when you are back
[15:58:09] <shoky> relipse: well you're missing a # or a .  for starters
[15:58:17] <relipse> oh lol good point
[15:58:19] <shoky> ;p
[15:58:27] <not_mike> is every site using HTML5?
[15:58:32] <not_mike> i mean, shit
[15:58:35] <relipse> not_mike: i believe so
[15:58:39] <not_mike> does every browser support HTML5?
[15:58:39] <shoky> most sites are using shit yea
[15:58:49] <relipse> my shit is green
[15:59:12] <shoky> veggies are bad for you mmk
[15:59:16] <relipse> so i doubt it supports html5
[15:59:34] <snover> i suspect that netscape 4 does not support html5
[15:59:39] <relipse>  $('#addon_transactions_subcategory').val(subcat); <-- how can i check if the value exists and if not, create it
[15:59:46] <relipse> it is a select box
[16:00:33] <shoky> .find('option:selected')  maybe? if that's what you mean by exists
[16:01:37] <shoky> or.. check the .val()
[16:02:33] <relipse> https://pastee.org/ddmun <-- that good?
[16:02:52] <relipse> err i meant https://pastee.org/fyp2c
[16:09:50] <relipse> if you double wrap inside a $( $() ) does that matter?
[16:11:05] <jedimind> it makes a weird lobsided vagina
[16:11:09] <jedimind> but otherwise no
[16:12:12] <relipse> dirtymind
[16:12:25] * relipse recently started using .apply() and i love it
[16:12:57] <CocoStorm> jedimind, looks a bit like your vagina
[16:13:18] <CocoStorm> without the tampon inside obviously
[16:17:48] <relipse> come on keep it clean
[16:18:05] <relipse> there are children and family men around
[16:39:39] <shoky> :-o
[16:40:12] <f00f> yes, please keep this tampon-free
[16:40:18] <f00f> i'm eating
[16:45:27] <Eviltwin> I love using jsFiddle / jQuery to make quick demos of shit
[16:45:36] <Eviltwin> A friend of mine was in a computer architecture class
[16:45:49] <Eviltwin> And didn't really understand loop tiling or rather why his attempt at loop tiling wasn't working
[16:46:04] <Eviltwin> Managed to kick out a demo in like 15 minutes to show him what his code was doing and show him how he needed to change it
[16:46:16] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/j3GnX/ and http://jsfiddle.net/j3GnX/1/
[16:46:33] <Eviltwin> They stall for like 20 seconds at first then run because I'm cheating
[16:47:35] <Eviltwin> It's a matrix transpose routine
[16:52:22] <shoky> i have no idea what that is but it looks impressive
[17:02:52] <bobbobbins> hey, i need to do a full browser width image slider, and there are about 5 million different sliders out there, does anyone have a favorite that would work for what I need?
[17:32:06] <Delf_> Hello, anyone would know how I can access the 'files' attribute on an input type=file element on IE 9 ?
[17:34:33] <Eviltwin> Might be a better question for #javascript
[17:34:39] <Eviltwin> I don't know off hand
[17:40:00] <CocoStorm> jedimind
[17:51:34] <shoky> is there a way to pipe/filter a promise and pass on more than one argument?   .then(function(a,b,c) { return ? }).done(function(a,b,c) { console.log(a,b,c) })
[17:56:45] <shoky> hrm guess i can live without it
[18:06:23] <dylan9o4_> heu guys
[18:06:55] <dylan9o4_> Isn't this supposed to provide all the events the element contains? http://jsbin.com/alukux/3/edit
[18:09:02] <shoky> dylan9o4_: no, only events set with jquery.  and it's ._data( DOMElement, "events" )   not ._data(selector, "events")
[18:09:37] <dylan9o4_> shoky: so how would I get the events set in html?
[18:10:01] <shoky> dylan9o4_: you shouldn't set events in html
[18:10:36] <dylan9o4_> how can I get all the events set
[18:11:22] <dylan9o4_> is it not possible
[18:12:25] <shoky> dylan9o4_: chrome devtools can show you event listeners on elements. prolly firebug too
[18:15:07] <relipse> hey guys
[18:15:55] <dylan9o4_> shoky: what about something set like _qf_onchange? it's not on there?
[18:16:16] <dylan9o4_> shoky: what about something set like _qf_onchange? it's not on there.
[18:16:17] <shoky> dylan9o4_: no idea what that is. doesn't look like a real event handler
[18:16:40] <dylan9o4_> But you can make custom ones yes shoky ?
[18:16:49] <dylan9o4_> shoky: it's not mine
[18:16:53] <shoky> dylan9o4_: i dont know what you're talking about sorry
[18:17:03] <dylan9o4_> custom events?
[18:17:08] <shoky> what about them?
[18:17:29] <dylan9o4_> would they show on the list in chrome?
[18:18:07] <shoky> any normal event listeners, including custom ones, yes.  _qf_onchange doesn't look like a real event handler
[18:19:30] <dylan9o4_> ill show
[18:25:52] <dylan9o4_> shoky: http://postimg.org/image/eb09d8579/
[18:26:18] <shoky> dylan9o4_: that's an attribute, not an event handler
[18:26:43] <shoky> .attr('_qf_onchange')  will give you its value..
[18:28:29] <not_mike> ?google test
[18:28:29] <b-ot> not_mike: Create Tests for Organizational Training and Certification Programs ... → http://www.test.com/
[18:28:30] <bot-t> not_mike, Create Tests for Organizational Training and Certification Programs ... - http://www.test.com/
[18:28:32] <not_mike> sweet
[18:28:40] <shoky> dylan9o4_: some library/framework is probably using that attribute somehow and setting up an event handler using its value.. but itself its not a real event handler
[18:29:24] <shoky> dylan9o4_: events are many times delegated to containing elements so the actual event listener might not be on the element you think its on
[18:29:42] <dylan9o4_> shoky: GOTCHA, I knew it was some type of event, and I knew it was attribute. I just didn't put 2 & 2 together
[18:30:59] <relipse> shoky: how much later are you going to be online?
[18:31:09] <shoky> relipse: going to sleep in a min
[18:35:40] <Pavlov> anyone know when jquery mobile 1.4 with better transitions/fixed position handling might show up?
[18:44:25] <relipse> shoky: do you have time to help me before you go to bed?
[18:45:45] * coldhead faps
[18:46:29] <tw2113> whoa there coldhead
[18:46:35] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[18:48:41] <RobW> Does anyone know how to debug javascript that doesn't work in IE unless the developer tools console is open (which makes it impossible)? There's a bug on the site that only affects IE when the developer bar is closed... Open the developer bar and refresh the page, and everything works fine (what the hell)?
[18:50:48] <relipse> shoky: you gone/
[18:51:23] <relipse> RobW: hmmm a console log problme?
[18:51:30] <arthurmaciel> hello
[18:51:34] <relipse> can you reproduce in jsfiddle
[18:52:26] <arthurmaciel> is it possible to toggle the 'editability' of form input (and textareas, radio buttons, etc.) elements?
[18:53:44] <relipse> arthurmaciel: what are you talking about?
[18:54:11] <relipse> readonly ?
[18:54:13] <relipse> attribute
[18:54:18] <relipse> or disabled
[18:55:46] <arthurmaciel> relipse: turn from readonly to editable
[18:56:00] <relipse> what are you talking about?
[18:56:11] <relipse> if its not readonly it is editable
[18:56:15] <relipse> unless it is disabled
[18:56:28] <arthurmaciel> relipse: I don't know if you use any android device, but when you open a contact you just 'view' and when you click the 'edit' button you can change its fields.
[18:57:07] <relipse> yes i use android, my guess is you would have a hidden <input> box and then click a button to edit, or use jEditable
[18:57:13] <arthurmaciel> I would like a form like that: you just read it (no editing possibility) and when the user clicks on 'edit' button all the input fields are available for editing.
[18:57:30] <relipse> yeah so you have form elements there, but they are all hidden
[18:57:46] <relipse> then you run through $('myform input').toggle(true);
[18:57:54] <relipse> and then hide the viewable text
[18:58:30] <arthurmaciel> relipse: that's it, dear friend! Thanks for pointing out jeditable!
[18:58:59] <relipse> its slightly ...old... but it will do the trick if you modify it sometimes
[18:59:41] <arthurmaciel> relipse: do you use something else for inline editing?
[19:00:20] <relipse> i found a fix to their ajax system call so i use a hacked version of jEditable
[19:00:34] <relipse> if you give me a sec i can find it, its on stackoverflow
[19:06:33] <relipse> argg i can't find it
[19:06:46] <relipse> the issue is it looks for a plain text response
[19:06:52] <relipse> and now adays everyone including me uses json
[19:07:08] <relipse> so you have to modify the jEditable source to make it work properly for json
[19:10:52] <arthurmaciel> relipse: thank you so much!
[19:10:58] <arthurmaciel> if you find the post, please let me know!
[19:11:24] <relipse> let me check my files
[19:14:01] <relipse> found it
[19:14:25] <arthurmaciel> yay!
[19:16:56] <relipse> this is what I used in one case --> http://www.tectual.com.au/posts/7/jQuery-Editable-Plugin-Best-In-Place-Editor-.html
[19:17:30] <relipse> arthurmaciel: and this is my modified version of it: https://pastee.org/xquvs
[19:18:00] <relipse> i see that is not the same as jEditable()
[19:18:07] <relipse> which I also used
[19:20:33] <Eigen_> whats an easy way of filiing out a pdf
[19:20:36] <Eigen_> *fiiling
[19:20:38] <Eigen_> ahh
[19:20:39] <Eigen_> filling
[19:20:58] <Eigen_> how I use this pdf hostContainer?
[19:21:00] <Cronoh> rolling your face around on the keyboard while you punch the tab key
[19:21:58] <arthurmaciel> relipse: thank you very much!
[19:42:54] <insel> if i want to add a ui-element dynamicly have i really to write the complet div-span-stuff like in http://jsfiddle.net/olli/HTSsz/ ? is there nothing like a template var btn = $('defaultbutton').text('foo'); ?
[19:48:12] <lenswipee> hi, how to disable the right click button on mouse using jquery? thanks heaps
[19:51:59] <tw2113> why
[19:52:25] <lenswipee> Because that's what I want.
[19:52:36] <coldhead> you don't want that
[19:52:38] <coldhead> no one wants that
[19:52:42] <coldhead> your users will hate you
[19:52:47] <lenswipee> I want that.
[19:52:48] <coldhead> i hate you
[19:52:52] <coldhead> and i am not even a user
[19:52:55] <lenswipee> My users want that
[19:53:07] <tw2113> why, other than "because"
[19:53:29] <lenswipee> no why, just solutions please.
[19:53:40] <tw2113> "why? because fuck you"
[19:53:41] <tw2113> gotcha

[19:53:54] <lenswipee> Question, "How to disable right mouse click using jQuery?"
[19:54:22] <tw2113> it's my right to ask why and get real answers, it's a small line found in the constitution
[19:54:29] <tw2113> very hard to read
[19:54:33] <tw2113> and in comic sans
[19:55:12] <coldhead> is there a comic serif?
[19:55:21] <bobbobbins> i worked for an image company many years ago that wanted to disable right clicking to try and discourage ignorant web users from stealing pictures
[19:55:22] <tw2113> if not, there should be
[19:55:36] <lenswipee> coldhead: I checked out the fiddle and WTF
[19:56:02] <tw2113> it disabled the context menu
[19:56:15] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/YTA8f/59/
[19:56:26] <coldhead> that is probably more like what you want
[19:56:29] <coldhead> a desperate plea
[19:56:38] <tw2113> you forgot "BRO"
[19:56:48] <coldhead> we don't know each other well enough for that
[19:56:57] <tw2113> does it matter?
[19:57:15] <tw2113> bro?
[19:57:22] <coldhead> i don't want to jeopardize our relationship at this early stage
[19:57:24] <coldhead> it's too important
[19:57:33] <coldhead> lol @ onboarding
[19:57:48] <coldhead> next time i have to talk about onboarding i am going to call it waterboarding
[19:57:54] <lenswipee> lol
[19:58:11] <lenswipee> coldhead: ummm... BTW the src url is invalid
[19:58:42] <lenswipee> coldhead: you're a bit of a mind reader. Yeah don't be stealing my images.
[19:58:51] <tw2113> why does it matter
[19:59:06] <tw2113> i could still steal the images nice n easy
[19:59:10] <tw2113> right click or no
[19:59:50] <lenswipee> tw2113: that's like saying i'll leave the front door wide open because I have a house alarm.
[20:00:33] <tw2113> no, disabling right click is like putting 1 bar on the window and every other way in is still completely useable
[20:01:22] <lenswipee> tw2113: I disagree on your poor attempt of an analogy.
[20:01:28] <coldhead> lenswipee: the src url is invalid because i didn't want you to be stealing my images
[20:01:30] <coldhead> bitch
[20:01:35] <tw2113> and i with yours
[20:01:54] <tw2113> anyone serious about stealing an image will succeed without a right click
[20:02:04] <lenswipee> coldhead: but i want my users to see them.
[20:02:25] <tw2113> people have been trying this since the 90s
[20:02:27] <lenswipee> :(
[20:02:28] <tw2113> it still fails
[20:03:30] <coldhead> you should be flattered if people want to steal your images
[20:03:33] <coldhead> they won't
[20:03:37] <coldhead> it will never really happen
[20:03:42] <binaryfus10nz> sup coldhead
[20:03:43] <coldhead> because people will never visit your site
[20:03:50] <coldhead> they spend their entire lives on facebook
[20:04:10] <lenswipee> coldhead: cmon man, help your cuz out.
[20:04:38] <lenswipee> Whos got that line of magic code.
[20:04:41] <binaryfus10nz> im getting a weird JS issue only in IE, can someone maybe take a look for me? the help would be greatly appreciated
[20:04:43] <coldhead> my cousin slept with me and broke my heart
[20:04:47] <coldhead> i will never help her

[20:04:58] <binaryfus10nz> coldhead, plz plz open that in IE
[20:05:02] <binaryfus10nz> check console
[20:05:04] <binaryfus10nz> any ideas?
[20:05:04] <coldhead> lol i don't have IE
[20:05:08] <binaryfus10nz> kill me
[20:05:10] <lenswipee> coldhead: and then he gave you AIDS. We heard that story before.
[20:05:31] <coldhead> it's a sad story

[20:05:53] <tw2113> lenswipee, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=disable+right+click+jquery
[20:05:58] <binaryfus10nz> anyone have a slight clue on maybe what I can do? works in everything but select versions of IE
[20:06:01] <lenswipee> coldhead: Keep up the meds. There will be a cure soon.
[20:06:46] <coldhead> why are we still worrying about this right click stuff when i linked 2 perfectly good working versions?
[20:07:37] <coldhead> binaryfus10nz: it's not clear to me why that would fail. but i'd write that code more conditionally so it would elegantly handle the missing top
[20:07:57] <lenswipee> coldhead: yours don't work because I can't see the images!
[20:08:03] <binaryfus10nz> but its not missing and fires fine in all browsers but IE9
[20:08:10] <binaryfus10nz> works in iE7/8/10
[20:08:15] <tw2113> maybe the image is there, but it's meant to blend in
[20:08:22] <coldhead> i don't like to use the word "are", but you really "are" a moron, lenswipee
[20:08:40] <coldhead> binaryfus10nz: alert('This site works best outside of IE9') ?
[20:08:46] <coldhead> what a world of pain
[20:08:49] <coldhead> i am sorry for your loss
[20:08:50] <binaryfus10nz> pfft
[20:09:06] <tw2113> lenswipee, the only issue is the <img></img> part
[20:09:11] <tw2113> make it <img /> and it works
[20:09:19] <lenswipee> tw2113: ok
[20:09:42] <tw2113> because html you!
[20:09:49] <coldhead> how does this grab you, lenswipee http://jsfiddle.net/YTA8f/60/
[20:09:59] <coldhead> like an eye on the end of a stalk?
[20:10:18] <lenswipee> changing the img part didnt work either
[20:10:22] <tw2113> did for me
[20:10:38] <tw2113> lemme guess, chrome user?
[20:10:48] <tw2113> you should try this thing called Firefox out
[20:11:06] <lenswipee> IE9 user
[20:11:11] <tw2113> i'm sorry
[20:11:14] <lenswipee> FF is out!
[20:11:18] <lenswipee> IE9 is in!
[20:11:24] <lenswipee> and chrome i suppose!
[20:11:58] <coldhead> this reminds me of the time a troll nailed my scrotum to a coffee table
[20:12:17] <lenswipee> ouch!
[20:12:22] <tw2113> so that's where your balls are
[20:12:31] <coldhead> it's better than i deserve
[20:12:36] <tw2113> i can call off the FBI search now
[20:12:52] <lenswipee> FBI still want him for other matters
[20:13:10] <tw2113> it pales in comparison to your list
[20:13:20] <lenswipee> and to yours
[20:13:23] <tw2113> they've been disbatched to collect you for trying to disable right click needlessly
[20:13:43] <lenswipee> actually they have given me a metal of honor.
[20:13:44] <coldhead> let's stop unamerican activitiesying each other and focus on my scrotum again
[20:13:49] <coldhead> medal*
[20:14:05] <lenswipee> yeah that's the one'
[20:14:14] <binaryfus10nz> coldhead, I just wonder how much you could be making writing code
[20:14:15] <lenswipee> but it's made of metal

[20:17:00] <tw2113> yup
[20:17:05] <bobbobbins> i thought magic johnson cured that
[20:17:11] <tw2113> he's not that magical
[20:17:29] <dylan9o4_> is anyone here familiar with QuickBooks?
[20:17:59] <coldhead> i've seen black books, is that similar?
[20:19:29] <dylan9o4_> there is an event being triggered on an element that appears to be onblur, but when I look at the console there is nothing under the blur event listener
[20:20:35] <dylan9o4_> I can't figure it out
[20:20:54] <coldhead> propagation?
[20:21:51] <binaryfus10nz> coldhead, what will it take for you to help me man
[20:21:54] <binaryfus10nz> im losing my mind
[20:22:21] <dylan9o4_> coldhead: that's why I asked if anyone if familiar with it, because I cant duplicate it, it's in an Iframe
[20:22:59] <coldhead> binaryfus10nz: i don't got IE, i can't reproduce it
[20:23:02] <binaryfus10nz> http://collabedit.com/6dfdy
[20:23:09] <coldhead> you could buy me a windows machine for testing
[20:23:11] <binaryfus10nz> just look at those lines of code plz plz
[20:23:13] <coldhead> but that would make us both sad
[20:23:25] <binaryfus10nz> line 4/5 its giving me this: SCRIPT5007: Unable to set property 'top' of undefined or null reference
[20:23:47] <binaryfus10nz> lol
[20:23:55] <binaryfus10nz> plz at least look at that collab link
[20:24:02] <binaryfus10nz> u mentioned about handling the .top default better
[20:24:28] <momomomomo> binaryfus10nz: Don't beg. Post your code to http://gist.github.com/ (all related code and errors), and then come back and explain: What you're trying to do, what the issue is, and what you think has gone wrong. This will help people be able to digest/understand your problem. Also check this out when you get a chance: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[20:24:39] <binaryfus10nz> umm

[20:36:43] <[E]sc> i'm using the formData to upload a file using ajax, and for some reason, when I append extra user inputted information (description), it doesn't append, yet other information which are already added by the script is received by the server.  When I do an alert, the description shows up.  Why is this happening?
[20:38:15] <coldhead> it sounds like some kind of bug
[20:38:34] <coldhead> i would guess you're not appending it correctly?
[20:38:52] <coldhead> or you're adding it "too late" and need to refresh the form somehow?
[20:41:08] <tw2113> coldhead, http://imgur.com/gallery/GfJkRUi
[20:42:54] <not_mike> are there any cool jquery plugins that mimic facebook's left panel? (pages, apps, groups, favorites, etc)
[20:43:00] <not_mike> that load on click
[20:43:11] <coldhead> i am having a problem where my local record store doesn't have the new eluvium album
[20:43:14] <coldhead> any ideas?
[20:43:26] <not_mike> wait nvm
[20:43:27] <not_mike> shit
[20:43:31] <tw2113> get a new record store that's not run by dingos
[20:43:32] <coldhead> wait i am going to put it in a fiddle
[20:44:37] <[E]sc> coldhead thanks for the advice.  How can I refresh a form dynamically like that?
[20:45:47] <coldhead> i am not sure, [E]sc
[20:45:58] <coldhead> i started googling it but i could barely understand what i was reading
[20:46:05] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day using jQuery
[20:51:05] <[E]sc> coldhead, thanks...it's my second haha
[20:52:33] <coldhead> you have much to teach me
[21:01:37] <[E]sc> coldhead, i probably don't know as much as you do,...i took your advice and solved my problem.  Thanks!
[21:23:15] <relipse> shoky
[21:23:17] <relipse> u there?
[21:45:58] <Keavon> I'm using jQuery UI's Resizable and I want to remove the handle IMAGE
[21:46:23] <Cork> handle image?
[21:46:45] <Keavon> yes, the thing in the very bottom left of the div
[21:46:47] <Cork> ah the corner
[21:46:52] <Keavon> http://jqueryui.com/resizable/
[21:47:06] <Keavon> the diagonal lines at the bottom left corner
[21:47:14] <Keavon> I've done some googling and can't find a good solution
[21:48:41] <Cork> #<your element> .ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se { background-image: none; }
[21:49:30] <Cork> the element it self is needed if you want diagonal resize to work
[21:49:58] <Cork> Keavon: ^
[21:50:01] <Keavon> Why is it needed?
[21:50:05] <Keavon> The other corners don't have to have it
[21:50:11] <Keavon> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39034206/Trackbox%20Web/index.html
[21:50:24] <Cork> the other corners doesn't support diagonal resize
[21:50:44] <Cork> like i said, if you want to support diagonal resize you need it
[21:51:24] <Keavon> can I change the icon to a 1px by 1px transparent image?
[21:51:33] <Cork> why?
[21:51:39] <Cork> #<your element> .ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se { background-image: none; } <--
[21:51:42] <Keavon> Because I don't want the icon
[21:51:47] <Cork> so remove it >_<
[21:51:56] <Keavon> that's what I'm asking how to do
[21:52:04] <Cork> and i've told you how two times
[21:52:10] <Cork> the image that is
[21:52:15] <Cork> not the element
[21:53:02] <Keavon> on https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39034206/Trackbox%20Web/index.html I added #trackboxWindow.ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se { background-image: none; }
[21:54:44] <Cork> you seam to be missing the core jquery ui css
[21:55:08] <b-lew> has anyone seen this error before? "Uncaught Error: HierarchyRequestError: DOM Exception 3"
[21:55:45] <Keavon> Cork, is this not correct? <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[21:56:03] <Cork> Keavon: not sure, the resize handlers isn't positioned correctly for me
[21:56:17] <Keavon> I'm testing this in the newest Firefox
[21:56:21] <Cork> me to
[21:56:44] <Keavon> oh, interesting
[21:56:46] <Cork> ah
[21:56:59] <Keavon> in chrome there's no resizing functionality
[21:57:04] <Cork> Keavon: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/ <-- mixed content
[21:57:08] <Keavon> and the border isn't extended past the page
[21:57:13] <Cork> remove the http: part
[21:57:53] <Keavon> ah
[21:58:20] <Keavon> works in Chrome now
[21:58:36] <Keavon> but I still need to remove the image in the bottom left
[21:59:12] <Keavon> I don't think I'm following your suggustion of #<your element> .ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se { background-image: none; }
[21:59:23] <Keavon> I don't really understand it
[21:59:23] <Cork> Keavon: #trackboxWindow .ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se not #trackboxWindow.ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se
[21:59:46] <Cork> .ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se is a child of the resizable
[22:00:23] <Cork> while you're at it you might want to seet width: 9px; height: 9px too
[22:00:46] <Cork> then it would behave like the handlers in the other corners
[22:00:47] <Keavon> I wasn't aware that CSS had a hierchy
[22:01:04] <Cork> sounds like you need to read up on css selectors
[22:01:23] <Keavon> yep
[22:01:30] <Keavon> never really learned CSS, I just kinda did it
[22:01:31] <Keavon> lol
[22:02:13] <Keavon> ok it's all working now
[22:02:22] <Keavon> just wondering what to do about the border outside of the frame
[22:02:22] <Cork> b-lew: you try to add an element as a child to something that can't have it as a child
[22:04:08] <Cork> Keavon: you have an outline set on the resiable
[22:04:19] <Cork> remove it if you don't want that
[22:04:34] <Keavon> I want the border, but want it to go around the white part
[22:04:42] <Keavon> should I create a div inside of the main one for the border?
[22:04:45] <Cork> then set a border and not an outline :)
[22:04:49] <Keavon> ah
[22:04:50] <Keavon> silly me
[22:05:03] <b-lew> interesting… Thanks @Cork
[22:05:10] <Keavon> like I said, not too experienced with CSS :)
[22:05:19] <b-lew> I'm pretty sure it has to do with this code…
[22:05:20] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/8007891
[22:05:24] <b-lew> looks fine to me.
[22:05:31] <b-lew> i'm a bit confused.
[22:05:59] <b-lew> oh wait i'm adding a class
[22:06:14] <b-lew> to the active li
[22:06:19] <Cork> ya and b isn't an element if i remember correctly
[22:06:26] <Cork> use $(this) instead
[22:07:07] <Cork> hmm nope b should be an element
[22:07:26] <b-lew> I think its an element.
[22:07:39] <Cork> ya
[22:07:47] <Cork> so i can't tell from just a dead code dump
[22:07:58] <Cork> if you want help create an example
[22:08:03] <Cork> ?p
[22:08:04] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:08:17] <b-lew> i can try that one sec
[22:09:51] <Keavon> Okay thanks for the help, Cork! Time for me to head off to bed now. Bye
[22:10:01] <Cork> o/
[22:24:19] <b-lew> I'm not for sure why this isn't working… its working on my site.
[22:24:20] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/ufqtP/2/
[22:24:38] <b-lew> I have updated it with the external quicksand file
[22:26:37] <Cork> uh.. the linebreaks in the addClass call?
[22:27:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ufqtP/3/
[22:27:29] <Cork> also you're linking to locahost >_<
[22:27:39] <Cork> (for quicksand.js)
[22:27:58] <b-lew> oh lol duh
[22:28:01] <b-lew> thanks
[22:28:07] <b-lew> linebreaks?
[22:28:37] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ufqtP/2/ line 54 and line 57
[22:29:38] <b-lew> I see. sorry.
[22:29:42] <b-lew> is that better?
[22:29:43] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/ufqtP/4/
[22:29:54] <b-lew> I added quicksand from my server
[22:30:02] <b-lew> its from another site but its not local so we can use it
[22:31:10] <b-lew> let me take out those comments to see it cleaner
[22:33:26] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/ufqtP/6/ better?
[22:34:42] <Cork> i'm trying to figure out why the quicksand resource isn't loading
[22:34:56] <coldhead> try restarting the browser?
[22:35:27] <b-lew> its weird. when you click on the link it links just fine.
[22:37:37] <Cork> this works somewhat http://fiddle.jshell.net/ufqtP/7/
[22:38:15] <b-lew> yea that's whats happening on my site
[22:38:20] <b-lew> locally
[22:38:46] <b-lew> thats where I'm getting the Uncaught Error: HierarchyRequestError: DOM Exception 3
[22:39:18] <Cork> there we go
[22:40:16] <Cork> it's quicksand line 122 that causes the crash
[22:41:06] <b-lew> oh so I'm not doing anything wrong?
[22:41:53] <Cork> you're trying to insert after an element that isn't in the dom
[22:42:12] <Cork> and... the browser goes "wtf where?!?" :D
[22:43:17] <Cork> this.parentNode.insertBefore( elem <new li element>, this.nextSibling <li element that isn't in the dom> );
[22:44:01] <Cork> so that is the error, why it happens is either a bug in quicksand, or cause of something you do
[22:44:18] <b-lew> probably me. I'm not the best at js
[22:44:25] <Cork> but quicksand is getting confused either way
[22:44:35] <b-lew> you think its cause i'm counting and adding a class
[22:44:42] <Cork> and uses an element that has been removed as reference for an insertBefore
[22:45:10] <b-lew> quicksand requires a callback thats why I'm doing it in that function after I call quicksand
[22:45:11] <coldhead> it's a matter for yourself
[22:50:02] <b-lew> thanks @Cork I'll keep trying to figure this out.
[22:53:08] <boytoy> Hey, I was wondering, what do you guys think about blocking old browsers from entering ones site? https://gist.github.com/kakekake89/5708463
[22:53:52] <Cork> 1. at the very least show the list of suggested browsers, not just one
[22:54:08] <snover> you’re pretty much the dumbest person in the world to *block* browsers
[22:54:09] <Cork> 2. as for the idea it self; not really
[22:54:30] <coldhead> one's*
[22:55:05] <Cork> adding a banner saying "you might see problems on this site cause you're using an old not supported browser" would be fine
[22:55:17] <Cork> but blocking them from even seeing the page... no
[22:55:58] <Cork> and also the market has browsers beside chrome, android, safari and ie...
[22:56:00] <coldhead> try having simpler sites that will work in old and new browsers
[22:56:06] <coldhead> i recommend the <font> tag
[22:56:11] <Cork> lol
[22:56:37] <coldhead> it doesn't matter whether you block browser or not anyway, no one ever visits sites other than facebook
[22:56:45] <boytoy> hmmmm
[22:56:48] <Cork> and blocking newbrowsers just cause there name isn't in a allow list is horribly bad
[22:57:16] <boytoy> coldhead: lulz
[22:57:37] <boytoy> Cork: yeah good points there man..
[22:58:28] <coldhead> limiting access for any reason makes TBL cry
[22:58:33] <coldhead> and he is not a man to cry easily
[22:58:41] <coldhead> he didn't even cry during The Notebook
[22:59:15] <Cork> boytoy: just to mention one, gnome's browser would be blocked on you're page
[22:59:37] <boytoy> TBL? The Notebook? what u talking about girl?
[22:59:37] <miCSu> does each loop iterate through elements in a direct order from beginnin of file to the end?
[22:59:37] <coldhead> your*
[22:59:44] <coldhead> tim bernes-lee
[22:59:54] <coldhead> the notebook is a popular girl movie about sex and death
[23:00:02] <Cork> miCSu: if you mean with .each; yes
[23:00:15] <Cork> if not .each, you need to give more information
[23:00:36] <boytoy> oh right that guy
[23:01:17] <boytoy> Cork: i can live without gnome :)
[23:01:22] <miCSu> yeah, .each was exactly what I meant.. just thinking if I could use it simply to unbind and bind events so that buttons are used for correct divs
[23:01:31] <boytoy> coldhead: we should watch it together sometime
[23:01:35] <Cork> boytoy: it's not about what you can live without
[23:01:43] <boytoy> Cork: hehe
[23:02:24] <Cork> boytoy: if something like that becomes common it would mean that new browsers would have to lie about who they are (ua strings all over again)
[23:03:27] <plazmonii> is anyone going to the nsnd this weekend?
[23:03:41] <Cork> boytoy: and you have SlateKit, dwb, uzbl...
[23:04:02] <Cork> basically; don't break the web! :P
[23:04:04] <boytoy> Cork: true true
[23:04:19] <b-lew> looks like this is a similar issue. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15495289/hierarchyrequesterror-dom-exception-3-when-trying-to-insertbefore
[23:04:56] <boytoy> thing is though my target market is young teenage chicks with iphones and androids, they'd probably be the last sorta people to ever resort to obscure browsers
[23:05:19] <boytoy> it's all about shoes and fashion to them
[23:05:33] <Cork> boytoy: doesn't really matter
[23:05:48] <boytoy> always having the latest and the hottest, same goes for their phones and browsers I think
[23:06:07] <Cork> boytoy: doing it the right way isn't much harder then doing it in a "i don't think it matters"
[23:06:09] <Cork> + way
[23:06:30] <boytoy> yeah you do make a compelling point
[23:06:57] <boytoy> Cork: thanks a lot for you're help man
[23:07:16] <Cork> and honestly i would go with a known not working browsers
[23:07:25] <Cork> and not not known working ones
[23:07:50] <Cork> list of *
[23:07:57] <boytoy> Cork: wait say that again plz?
[23:08:12] <Cork> instead of having a list with browsers that should not trigger the warning
[23:08:21] <Cork> build a list of old browsers you KNOW will have problems
[23:08:22] * boytoy is waiting for coldhead to correct his intentional typo
[23:08:54] <coldhead> your*
[23:08:59] <boytoy> Cork: yeah perhaps
[23:09:09] <boytoy> coldhead: good girl :P
[23:09:20] <coldhead> thanks
[23:23:12] <coldhead> good chat, guys
[23:26:07] <houser> Hi, I know that responsive pages can make things appear different depending on different resolution, but what if you want to cut away content on the page and make it look radically different on a phone and on a webpage? Is that possible?
[23:26:32] <coldhead> sure it is
[23:26:39] <coldhead> display: none and media queries
[23:26:54] <coldhead> anything is possible if you believe in ourself
[23:26:57] <coldhead> yourself*
[23:28:25] <houser> coldhead, well display:none;mmm that will still download a lot of unecessary data from the server
[23:28:49] <Cork> houser: it SHOULD only download the html
[23:28:53] <miCSu> is there some alternative to .nextAll that would get also following sibling's children, following parents' etc ?
[23:29:07] <Cork> as display: none is never rendered, the images and so on is never requested
[23:29:09] <houser> Cork, html is also a lot of data :)
[23:29:47] <Cork> houser: then it sounds like you might have over engineered the html
[23:29:59] <Cork> or you have way to much data on the one page :)
[23:30:06] <houser> Cork, i have not engineered anything yet :)
[23:41:45] <coldhead> houser: if you care that much you don't want responsive, you want a separate mobile site
[23:41:53] <coldhead> i hate separate mobile sites
[23:42:26] <Cork> there is pros and cons to both options
[23:43:09] <Cork> you sometimes want to use different type of widgets based on what unit type it is
[23:43:38] <Cork> and as long as the user can switch between the two without being forced back, it should be fine
[23:44:23] <coldhead> the best is when the redirect to mobile drops the path from the URL
[23:44:30] <coldhead> that is the best thing in the world
[23:44:43] <Cork> heh
[23:44:48] <Cork> ya that is always fun...
[23:45:01] <Cork> but i know one thing i love more
[23:45:10] <Cork> "we have an app, please install it"
[23:45:13] <coldhead> oatmeal?
[23:45:14] <coldhead> oh right
[23:45:20] <coldhead> yes that's wonderful too
[23:45:27] <coldhead> esp. when it's a paid app
[23:45:30] <Cork> but, i just want a freeking phone number
[23:45:32] <Cork> ya
[23:45:38] <coldhead> and when you get it on every page
[23:45:51] <Cork> no, no you can't access anypage
[23:45:51] <houser> Cork, but how do you detect when to use what type then?
[23:46:05] <Cork> as soon as it sees the ua it redirects to an "install the app" page
[23:46:10] <Cork> you can't get any content
[23:46:29] <Cork> houser: the login page
[23:46:44] <Cork> houser: when the login page is loaded the correct form factor is picked
[23:46:57] <Cork> and then i show a widget for the user to switch when ever they want
[23:47:12] <Cork> and i have a /desktop/ /mobile/ section in the url
[23:47:17] <coldhead> yeah users love those widgets
[23:47:45] <SomeoneWeird> Does anyone know any good jquery "timeline" libraries? I really like http://timeline.verite.co/ but I need it to have events that I can listen for so I can externally set stuff, any ideas?
[23:47:46] <Cork> coldhead: well it's better then forcing them
[23:48:19] <Cork> and ya, both sites work ok on both types of devices
[23:48:46] <Cork> but the mobile site has a touch and full page oriented structure
[23:48:58] <Cork> while the desktop one has context menus and grids
[23:49:26] <boytoy> So I'm gonna display a banner if the user uses an old / obscure browser: https://gist.github.com/kakekake89/5708463 -- have I gotten my user-agent strings right though?
[23:49:29] <Cork> *full page scroll oriented
[23:50:20] <Cork> boytoy: you mean you only support one specific version of each browser?
[23:50:39] <Cork> what about the firefox 17esr for example?
[23:50:59] <coldhead> var old = confirm('Are you using an older browser?')
[23:51:06] <Cork> lol
[23:51:17] <boytoy> Cork: nope from one specific version and up
[23:51:19] <SomeoneWeird> lol
[23:51:38] <Cork> boytoy: what in ff19 is it you need that ff10 doesn't have when it comes to the site?
[23:51:44] <Cork> or chrome 18 for that matter?
[23:52:13] <houser> Cork, ok and what criteria do you use to select the form factor?
[23:52:37] <boytoy> Cork: good point i should probably lower my versionays
[23:52:39] <coldhead> a tape measure
[23:52:39] <Cork> houser: for that specific pace it's ua sniffing
[23:52:50] <Cork> houser: as it is only a "guess the default"
[23:52:54] <coldhead> case* ?
[23:53:02] <Cork> *page
[23:53:09] <houser> Cork, hmm ok..sniffing screen resolution from ua?
[23:53:15] <coldhead> thanks Corksy
[23:53:16] <Cork> hell no
[23:53:31] <Cork> that is for the adoptive design in the css
[23:53:54] <Cork> the only thing i use the ua for is to pick if it should be touch oriented or mouse oriented
[23:54:18] <Cork> *try to guess if it should be
[23:55:24] <boytoy> Cork: about that, how do u do that?
[23:55:40] <boytoy> like where'd you get the list of touch vs mouse strings or whatever?
[23:56:21] <coldhead> var touch = confirm('Would you like to use a touch interface?')
[23:57:22] <Cork> ?g detect mobile browsers
[23:57:22] <b-ot> Cork: Detect Mobile Browsers - Open source mobile phone detection → http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/
[23:57:24] <bot-t> Cork, Detect Mobile Browsers - Open source mobile phone detection - http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/
[23:57:54] <houser> Cork, i see...and how do you guess at that..what info in the ua?
[23:58:34] <Cork> the list is what mobile browsers have in the ua
[23:58:45] <Cork> so if the test results in true i default to the mobile site
[23:58:49] <Cork> else i take the desktop
[23:59:15] <boytoy> mavellous
[23:59:32] <boytoy> ma-ve-las
[23:59:36] <boytoy> group hug!!
