[05:02:16] <momomo> for a an jquery ajax call that reeturns a promise, what is the correct way to add to success event?
[05:02:48] <Cork> bind .done
[05:02:54] <Cork> or .then
[05:06:36] <momomo> Cork, ok, in what order are these executed. For instance, if I supply a succees or on complete methods to ajax .. do they fire before the promise done ?
[05:07:55] <momomo> and can those method abort or cancel the done if deemed it's a failure ( in oncomplete)  ?
[05:08:01] <Cork> ya, but i would recommend not using the old complete, success and error
[05:08:43] <Cork> $.ajax().always(function() {}).done(function() {}).fail(function() {})
[05:08:47] <Cork> is what i recommend using
[05:09:09] <momomo> Cork, i have logic already vested that relies on passing in functions :(
[05:09:22] <momomo> i also manage everything in oncomplete
[05:09:30] <Cork> oncomplete?
[05:09:31] <momomo> and invoke my own failure and success
[05:09:33] <Cork> what's that?
[05:09:34] <momomo> completttte
[05:09:41] <momomo> just complete
[05:09:47] <Cork> aha...
[05:10:54] <Cork> btw, no the property callbacks can't affect the promise callbacks as far as i knoow
[05:10:55] <Cork> *know
[05:11:01] <momomo> I think i will just wrap everything in a promise of my own and retain controll
[05:11:04] <Cork> they are completely separate things
[05:11:11] <Cork> uh
[05:11:35] <Cork> you could just extract those callback functions and convert them to modern callbacks
[05:13:29] <momomo> yes, maybe that would be best
[05:29:20] <stennowork> so i just found out: $(element).data("foo") will cast to Number, $(element).attr("data-foo") wont
[05:29:35] <stennowork> assuming <element data-foo="1"> for example
[05:30:04] <Cork> stennowork: attr is same as dom.getAttribute
[05:30:13] <Cork> and attributes are ALWAYS strings
[05:30:15] <Cork> and nothing else
[05:30:19] <stennowork> but why would .data(foo) cast to Number?
[05:30:23] <Cork> (except null if it doesn't exist)
[05:30:31] <stennowork> thats the thing i am confused about
[05:30:35] <Cork> stennowork: cause it is a much more complex data support
[05:30:48] <Cork> it supports all forms of data structures
[05:30:53] <Cork> including doms and what not
[05:31:32] <Cork> $(element).data('ref', elm2); $(element).data('ref').data('foo') <-- works
[05:31:58] <Cork> $(element).attr('data-ref', elm2); <-- errors on converting a dom element to a string
[05:32:28] <Cork> stennowork: .data isn't a straight mapping to data- attributes
[05:32:39] <stennowork> well i can see that it makes sense when binding/retrieving from data set to jquery objects/elements, but not when reading from DOM data- attribute
[05:32:46] <Cork> stennowork: .data looks in an internal object in jquery, and if that doesn't exist it parses the data- attribute
[05:33:09] <Cork> stennowork: .data runs the attribute content through parseJSON
[05:33:15] <Cork> unless it is a straight text
[05:33:22] <stennowork> aah
[05:33:27] <stennowork> that explains it then, thanks
[05:33:39] <stennowork> so i will use attr("data-foo") becaues i need it as string
[05:33:49] <stennowork> alright, thanks for the explanation
[05:33:56] <momomo> what is the proper way to clear an array so that it can be garbage collected ... it's a method parameter, so array = null; won't work
[05:34:08] <Cork> momomo: arr.length = 0
[05:34:21] <momomo> array.length = 0 is suggested but i am guessing the garbage collector will never know
[05:34:32] <Cork> momomo: it will
[05:34:38] <momomo> ook
[05:34:49] <stennowork> ook? ook!
[05:34:58] <Cork> momomo: length = 0 removes the keys referenceing the values
[05:35:13] <Cork> momomo: and as nothing is referencing the values anymore the values gets gc:ed
[05:35:15] <momomo> Cork, i trust you, but it is not a method call, right?
[05:35:24] <Cork> it is; kinda
[05:35:29] <Cork> it is a property setter
[05:36:01] <momomo> I am guessing the js implementors must be taking care of that .. it would have better if they went to greater lengths and provides us with a .clear() method instead
[05:36:03] <momomo> haha
[05:36:22] <momomo> but they like magic i take it
[05:36:32] <Cork> momomo: Array.prototype.clear = function() { this.length = 0; }
[05:36:35] <Cork> done :)
[05:36:48] <Cork> momomo: it isn't really magic
[05:37:16] <Cork> when you know how object and prototype works it is quite logical
[05:37:32] <momomo> Cork, yes, but I am just saying, it should be baked in .. there is no way of actually knowing that anything other than lenght is actually modified when array.length = 0; is used .. that's magic if they clear keys as well
[05:37:59] <Cork> momomo: if you prefer you can just do array = [];
[05:38:00] <momomo> Cork, i know what prototyping is .. but I don't make the habit of appending my own stuff too much
[05:38:03] <Cork> though it is more costly
[05:38:09] <momomo> Cork, i can't in a method
[05:38:15] <momomo> param
[05:38:29] <Cork> param...
[05:38:34] <Cork> are you talking about arguments?
[05:38:40] <momomo> yes, jeezus
[05:38:40] <Cork> or what "param" are you talking about?
[05:38:50] <Cork> ya, arguments are special...
[05:39:01] <momomo> i am just saying, wouldn't it make more sense if we had a clear method, so alot of people wouldnt have to google it and examine various ways ?
[05:39:01] <Cork> but... you shouldn't modify arguments...
[05:39:04] <Cork> ever
[05:39:26] <momomo> Cork, the array is an argument to a method .. so i can't null or [] it
[05:39:44] <Cork> you shouldn't use length either
[05:39:54] <Cork> as that will modify the source array
[05:40:20] <momomo> that's what i want
[05:40:37] <momomo> or at least clear all of it's entries
[05:40:48] <Cork> that is normally a bad structure
[05:41:11] <momomo> not really, i walk over the entries rather than delete them one by one .. i do it after
[05:41:16] <momomo> myArray.splice(0) is also another option
[05:41:20] <momomo> but not sure about the cost
[05:41:41] <Cork> its about the same
[05:42:57] <momomo> Cork, is there a way to download the sources for ecma so one can navigate to something other than empty skeletons ( in intellij ) ?
[05:43:20] <momomo> so one can see what those methods actually do and if they do it effeciently ?
[05:43:28] <Cork> native code isn't something that you can inspect
[05:43:32] <Cork> it isn't javascript
[05:43:41] <Cork> and it differ from implementor to implementor
[05:44:12] <momomo> yes, is none of it jks ?
[05:44:13] <momomo> js?
[05:44:43] <Cork> what function are you talking about?
[05:45:05] <Cork> but ya, the standard functions on array are basically all native
[05:47:07] <momomo> relevant: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1232046/961018
[05:55:12] <momomo> this suggests looping is fastest: http://stackoverflow.com/a/23647927/961018\
[05:55:13] <momomo> http://stackoverflow.com/a/23647927/961018
[05:56:51] <Cork> careful with so, the ratio of junk of there is high
[05:57:00] <Cork> *on there*
[07:04:12] <abkabkabk> is there a better way? es6 find an index where char.hp>1 and highest char.lvl ....https://jsfiddle.net/uLtbomvk/
[07:07:22] <codecutter> would this be true? 'undefined' === '0'
[07:07:33] <codecutter> would this be true? if(undefined === '0')
[07:09:04] <codecutter> nvm
[09:14:24] <lintguy> I have a function with a deferred that does: return $.when.all(requests), but i would like to process the result first and THEN return it, but i don't know how to do that.
[09:14:56] <lintguy> Anyone have any experience with this?
[09:17:09] <shoky> lintguy:  i assume you mean $.when.apply($, requests) or something
[09:17:57] <shoky> lintguy: you can use .then to process the result  e.g.  return $.when.apply($,requests).then(function(results) { ... return whatever; });
[09:21:10] <lintguy> return while processing? Hmm, let me try. Thanks!
[09:22:12] <shoky> it's not while, it's after, like you wanted ;p
[09:22:20] <shoky> while doesn't make any sense ;p
[09:22:49] <shoky> well, maybe with generators crap but i'm sure you don't mean that ;p
[09:23:15] <lintguy> Not literally, but yeah - it works as expected!
[09:23:26] <shoky> awesomes
[09:23:26] <lintguy> Thanks a million, been stuck on this for what feels like forever
[09:23:37] <shoky> np
[09:23:55] <lintguy> Sometimes it's better to just ask for help :)
[09:27:14] <Serbanned> hy guys
[09:27:27] <Serbanned> i wanna kno if jquery might potentially die in a coupla time ?
[09:28:28] <shoky> coupla time?
[09:28:32] <Serbanned> yeha like 3-4 yrs
[09:28:34] <shoky> die?
[09:28:48] <Serbanned> As trend
[09:29:24] <Serbanned> and wht might potentially replace it
[09:31:02] <shoky> uhm i doubt it
[09:31:56] <Serbanned> good
[09:31:57] <Serbanned> Thanx
[09:34:24] <jose3_> hola
[09:34:32] <hellyeah> ola
[09:45:29] <arc_> what could even replace jquery, is there even a competing library
[09:46:29] <arc_> i really don't see what anything could do any simpler to improve upon it
[10:03:05] <Cork> arc_: es6 adds most of what jquery does natively
[10:03:58] <Cork> arc_: so ya, it is a very nice lib, but i would say not needed in pages without too complex interactions
[10:15:29] <Doel2> does anyone know how I would check whether the url is not the same of a link as the current url? I need to smoothly scroll to hashtags within the page but it shouldn´t prevent going to a different page if the url is different
[10:16:23] <Doel2> can I use window.location.href for this?
[10:16:32] <Cork> Doel2: and you can't require those links to be <a href="#position">?
[10:17:03] <Cork> if you can then you can just check if this.href[0] == '#'
[10:17:34] <Doel2> yeah what I´m doing is: if (this.hash)
[10:17:47] <Cork> that isn't enough
[10:17:55] <Cork> cause hash is true as long as the link has a # in it
[10:18:02] <Doel2> yeah exactly
[10:18:07] <Cork> what you want is if it is ONLY that
[10:18:23] <Cork> and that is $(this).attr('href')[0] == '#'
[10:18:32] <Doel2> so I should use that instead?
[10:18:36] <Cork> yes
[10:18:44] <Cork> it should if you can require what i asked
[10:18:44] <Doel2> let me try real quick, thanks Cork
[10:19:03] <Doel2> those links are already a href I think
[10:19:15] <Cork> cause <a href="http://my-domain.com/page.html#top"> won't work
[10:19:32] <Cork> cause then [0] == "h" not "#"
[10:19:48] <Doel2> hmm let me check real quick
[10:19:59] <Cork> if you need to allow those you would need a much more complex selector
[10:20:09] <Doel2> yeah no it´s the complete url
[10:20:21] <Cork> and you can't change that?
[10:20:36] <Cork> (cause that would simplify this A LOT)
[10:20:45] <Doel2> I know but I can´t it´s a wordpress thing
[10:20:51] <arc_> can't you just use if (this.href.includes('#'))
[10:20:54] <Cork> blah...
[10:21:13] <Cork> arc_: no cause that will catch other urls
[10:21:28] <Doel2> so if the page url is different then the current page url I should not prevent it from redirecting somehow
[10:21:53] <Doel2> can´t I check whether window.location.href is not equal to this.attr(href)?
[10:22:24] <arc_> can you just smooth scroll to the thing that's been clicked on by binding an event listener to it rather than by scrolling to hashes
[10:22:27] <Cork> Doel2: if(this.href.replace(new Regexp('^' + window.location), '') == '#')
[10:22:30] <Cork> that should work
[10:22:40] <arc_> or that :p
[10:22:42] <Doel2> let me check Cork, thanks ;)
[10:22:46] <Cork> Doel2: no, cause you don't care about the href
[10:22:54] <Cork> you want the hash IF it is the current url
[10:23:02] <Cork> actually, no that won't work
[10:23:16] <Cork> cause that will remove the complete url if the hash exist in location
[10:23:55] <Doel2> yup
[10:23:59] <Doel2> doesn´t work as expected
[10:24:19] <Cork> and... escape
[10:24:30] * Cork 's head hurts..
[10:24:34] <Doel2> :(
[10:24:38] <arc_> ok then again, can you just smooth scroll to the thing that's been clicked on by binding an event listener to it rather than by scrolling to hashes
[10:25:02] <Cork> arc_: he wants to prevent the link from activating
[10:25:07] <Doel2> I´ve done a jquery(´html, body´).animate scrolltop this.hash
[10:25:08] <Cork> else he can't do smooth scroll
[10:25:20] <Doel2> I want the link to not be prevented when on a different page
[10:25:33] <Doel2> because right now it does smooth scroll when I´m on the current page that the hashtag has
[10:25:46] <Doel2> but it disables going to the other page whenever I click on it when I´m on a different page
[10:25:55] <arc_> that's real confusing :p
[10:26:11] <Doel2> wait let me create a jsfiddle
[10:26:21] <Doel2> or wait that doesn´t work jsfiddle only has one page S
[10:26:24] <Doel2> :S
[10:26:28] <arc_> ya.
[10:26:42] <Doel2> wait I´ll create a jsfiddle and show you what it does on my site
[10:26:53] <arc_> will you create the first jsfiddle that links to other jsfiddles
[10:26:58] <arc_> only time will tell
[10:28:56] <Doel2> ok this is what my code is doing: https://jsfiddle.net/rae471en/
[10:29:03] <Doel2> and this is the site: test.multidispo.com
[10:29:23] <Doel2> so on the home page if you click on contact it scrolls to it
[10:29:33] <Doel2> but when you are on a different page and click on contact it won´t go to the homepage
[10:30:04] <Cork> Doel2: https://jsfiddle.net/pgp06dt1/
[10:30:07] <Cork> that is what you need
[10:30:07] <Doel2> I need it to always scroll to the contact tag on the homepage, or in other words, when on other page. Link to the homepage and scroll
[10:30:51] <Doel2> thanks Cork I´ll test that
[10:31:10] <arc_> i feel like i have seen a version of this site before
[10:31:24] <arc_> but i might just be confusing it with something else
[10:32:31] <Doel2> YES it works!
[10:32:33] <Doel2> thanks Cork :D
[10:32:36] <taplar> no one on the internet reuses other peoples websites
[10:32:39] <taplar> it's just not done
[10:32:56] <arc_> wait .. is there not an extra single quote after the 0 on line 3
[10:33:00] <Doel2> I use a theme that I changed a bit
[10:33:12] <Doel2> the theme could look similar
[10:33:15] <Doel2> but it´s not the same
[10:33:38] <Doel2> anyways thanks a lot Cork, I got it working :DF
[10:34:51] <Doel2> hmmm it doesn´t seem to work properly for this page though: http://test.multidispo.com/faq
[10:34:57] <Doel2> the first time it jumps
[10:36:04] <Doel2> so in other words if you are on the same page and there is no hashtag used yet, it will jump the first time you click on the link
[10:36:13] <Doel2> but if it´s already there and you click on it it does work
[10:36:40] <Doel2> so the current url NEEDS to have a hashtag before it scrolls down?
[10:50:47] <arc_> hm, apparently on jsfiddle window.location.href = https://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/
[11:00:52] <Cork> arc_: ya, it runs the display in an iframe
[11:01:03] <Cork> (bottom right frame)
[11:39:32] <rokshis> Hello guys, I have one problem with my website scrollbar. I am using custom jquery scroll - link: http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/ . I am applying this scrollbar to my custom container (specific part of the body). The container, has some items in it, and every single of the item has a button. For example "Add to cart" button. Everytime any button of the item is pressed, the container automatically scrolls by my
[11:39:32] <rokshis> prefixed scrollAmount. Anyone has ever encountered this issue or knows how to stop it from scrolling after pressing any button (like Add to Cart, or Inspect and etc. Just random buttons.)

[11:45:39] <robertmaxrees> rokshis can you a jsfiddle showing the problem?>
[11:48:22] <rokshis> robertmaxrees, Yeah. Give me a min :P
[11:48:26] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[12:20:18] <Simbaclaws> Cork, you still there?
[12:20:40] <Simbaclaws> I'm the same person as Doel2 was today, doel is the place I work so several people could be Doel1, 2, 3, 4 etc...
[12:24:22] <Simbaclaws> I think I'll have to adjust the condition you showed me

[12:28:45] <rokshis> Codepen: https://codepen.io/rokshis/pen/GqzZNy (In order to reproduce the bug, you have to scroll about 600px by yourself manually.)
[12:28:45] <robertmaxrees> rokshis dude, create a fiddle.
[12:29:01] <rokshis> I did. Codepen.
[12:29:05] <rokshis> robertmaxrees,  https://codepen.io/rokshis/pen/GqzZNy
[12:29:10] <robertmaxrees> oh.  no reason to repost the same paragraph then.
[12:29:19] <rokshis> soz.
[12:30:19] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want it to scroll at all?
[12:30:34] <rokshis> I want it to scroll only with mouse wheel. But not when the "button1" or "button2" is clicked.
[12:30:40] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[12:31:08] <robertmaxrees> without reading the docs of the plugin, the easiest way would be to bind a click listener to those buttons and preventDefault against the event.  that might do it.
[12:38:30] <robertmaxrees> rokshis that make sense?
[12:39:57] <rokshis> robertmaxrees, give me a sec
[12:46:59] <rokshis> robertmaxrees, didn't help out. Check my codepen.
[12:48:00] <robertmaxrees> worked foir me a second agoi.
[12:48:01] <robertmaxrees> *ago
[12:48:41] <robertmaxrees> something is way broken here.
[12:48:48] <robertmaxrees> it's not even regiustering that handler.
[12:50:14] <rokshis> Could you give me the exact code you used?
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> i just used a delegated listener.
[12:51:00] <rokshis> You mean not registering, like, it doesn't even listen to the click even? I can see the alert, so it does work? Or I am missing something?
[12:51:10] <robertmaxrees> i can't see the alert at all.
[12:52:29] <robertmaxrees> this plugin is probably hijacking those buttons for some reason.  no idea.
[12:55:08] <rokshis> Well, the alert works fine for me.
[12:55:20] <robertmaxrees> it only works for the last buttons for me.
[12:55:29] <robertmaxrees> so the plugin is probably stomping over click events.
[12:55:40] <rokshis> Oh damn. Really
[12:55:43] <rokshis> I noticed that only now :O
[12:55:56] <robertmaxrees> the docs for that plugin seem pretty in depth, so i'd check to see if there's something obvious in there.
[12:56:02] <rokshis> i did
[12:56:07] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:56:09] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[12:56:18] <rokshis> I wouldn't have came here, if I hadn't done that before.
[12:56:43] <robertmaxrees> not questioning you.  we get plenty of folks who don't ever actually read documentation.  no idea what else to sugges.
[12:58:04] <Simbaclaws> Cork, I altered your script a bit, now it works like intended :) I'm Doel2 btw
[13:32:08] <tables> how do i use jquery to load an entire page?
[13:32:19] <tables> i don't want it in a div, i want it to load in the entire page
[13:32:30] <robertmaxrees> and replace everything on the current page?
[13:32:44] <tables> yes
[13:32:58] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea.
[13:33:08] <tables> how come?
[13:33:28] <robertmaxrees> lots of scripts and things rely on a document ready.  you'll have tons of assets and things in memory that won't get cleared out.
[13:33:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd focus on replacing relevant parts of the page, not the whole page itself.
[13:33:58] <tables> ok
[13:34:04] <tables> but is it possible to load the entire page to the entire page?
[13:34:12] <tables> because i really want to
[13:34:46] <robertmaxrees> this is what document.write was made for.
[13:34:57] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to use vanilla js instead of jquery
[13:35:18] <robertmaxrees> but i would really reconsider that idea.
[13:37:24] <tables> $('body').load('/index.php');
[13:37:24] <robertmaxrees> why do you think that's what you need to do?
[13:37:25] <tables> i found that
[13:37:27] <tables> does it work?
[13:37:36] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't replace the entire page.
[13:37:40] <robertmaxrees> that replaces the body.
[13:38:07] <tables> how do i use that thing?
[13:38:18] <tables> don't i need some function to start with in <script></script> tags?
[13:38:20] <robertmaxrees> for what you want to do, you need to use document.write
[13:38:31] <tables> i wanna try the body load first
[13:38:41] <robertmaxrees> then sure, use .load()
[13:38:48] <robertmaxrees> but a lot of things are going to break.
[13:38:51] <tables> how do i use that code?
[13:38:55] <tables> $('body').load('/index.php');
[13:38:59] <robertmaxrees> just like that.
[13:39:05] <tables> i wanna see what the body load looks like first
[13:39:08] <tables> inside script?
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> where else would you put it?
[13:39:23] <Yepp> Is it possible to change ajax options dynamically? I mean, I would like to make a partial views cause the code is being reused often but some options vary on different part of the app... is it possible?
[13:39:42] <robertmaxrees> tables and if you're not careful, you're going to bring in the <head> from the other page.
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> Yepp like what?
[13:40:10] <Yepp> I mean like, var namehere = ajax({ optionhere: function(){} }}) then change the optionhere?
[13:40:18] <Yepp> something like that
[13:40:29] <robertmaxrees> you could make a function that you pass options to.
[13:40:48] <Yepp> I can used .done fail and always instead of success error complete
[13:41:00] <robertmaxrees> you really want .then(), but yeah.
[13:41:00] <Yepp> but sometimes beforesend and any other params changes
[13:41:50] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/7bfbe03441a1
[13:41:58] <robertmaxrees> though i'd look into an MVC or similar framework at that point./
[13:43:40] <tables> http://paste2.org/DAUZOstv
[13:43:43] <tables> robertmaxrees: it's not working
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> you still have to have a head tag duder.
[13:44:06] <robertmaxrees> and wait for document ready.
[13:44:13] <robertmaxrees> can't just replace an element that doesn't yet exist.
[13:44:17] <tables> ah
[13:44:25] <tables> what is document ready?
[13:44:30] <tables> can you fix the code for me?
[13:44:38] <tables> wait i made a booboo
[13:44:38] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: here's my starting code https://gist.github.com/xxRockOnxx/e56263db82be852ebc2f01830a81ca68 line 196
[13:44:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.  let's go ahead and setup a contract.
[13:44:53] <Yepp> I'm planning to move out this whole stuffs on a partial view
[13:44:53] <robertmaxrees> my rate's pretty high though - not sure if you want to really pay me ;)
[13:44:54] <tables> http://paste2.org/vhKZn9kG
[13:44:57] <Yepp> instead of copy pasting it always
[13:44:58] <tables> robertmaxrees: ^
[13:45:02] <tables> er i'll fix it then
[13:45:06] <tables> what is document ready?
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> still need a valid html doucment, btw.
[13:45:31] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a doctype and a head tag.
[13:46:21] <Yepp> I could return $.ajax cause that would be making a call. But mine is not calling, I'm initializing it. I dunno if that makes sense tho
[13:46:35] <robertmaxrees> Yepp huh?
[13:46:48] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/xxRockOnxx/e56263db82be852ebc2f01830a81ca68#file-gistfile1-txt-L196
[13:46:50] <robertmaxrees> yepp you mean you'd like you create a factory that you can run later?
[13:47:05] <robertmaxrees> which part?  the isvalid or the beforesubmit?
[13:47:45] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: would like to store the .ajaxform on a variable and modify it later on to append some options or override the current params in it
[13:47:48] <Yepp> example:
[13:48:06] <tables> robertmaxrees: how can i add a loading gif or loading text to it?    http://paste2.org/8ZN4Idfs
[13:48:17] <robertmaxrees> Yepp then you'd want to store the settings object itself.
[13:48:19] <tables> i want "LOADING..." or a gif added to it
[13:48:26] <Yepp> var theform = selector.ajaxform({ options..... }); then later on, theform({ new params or override});
[13:48:30] <robertmaxrees> tables have you even tried the docs?
[13:48:39] <robertmaxrees> Yepp yeah, not gonna work that way.
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> not without some really unusual patterns.
[13:49:05] <robertmaxrees> just make an options object and override things as appropriate.
[13:49:14] <Yepp> options object... hmm
[13:49:29] <robertmaxrees> var myOptions = {}; then you can call selector.ajaxform(myOptions);
[13:50:25] <Yepp> yea, and just put return selector.ajaxform() in a function? So if there would ever be any changes later on I can call it?
[13:50:28] <Yepp> hmm not bad
[13:50:32] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:50:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[13:50:39] <Yepp> oh
[13:50:45] <robertmaxrees> return selector.ajaxform() will still run that.
[13:50:59] <Yepp> even if it's inside a function that's not being called yet?
[13:51:17] <robertmaxrees> it'll run when that function is called.
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?>
[13:52:22] <Yepp> that's why I thought of putting it in a function first. So that if there ever be any changes to options object, I can then just run the function
[13:52:35] <robertmaxrees> that just seems kind of strange, but sure.
[13:53:19] <Yepp> This what would happen if not (not sure if the changes in the option object will still make some changes after it is initialized) this is what would happen:
[13:53:51] <robertmaxrees> changing the options object won't change anything once it's been initialized.
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> unless the plugin is going something strange.
[13:54:00] <Yepp> Partial view: ( var options -> initialize), Main view: (partial view -> options)
[13:54:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:54:10] <Yepp> yea that's why would like to put it in a function
[13:54:18] <robertmaxrees> then there you go.
[13:54:36] <robertmaxrees> but i'd still investigate something other than jquery for your overall breaking up.
[13:55:01] <Yepp> hmm, like what?
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> literally any framework.
[13:55:17] <robertmaxrees> backbone, react, riot, etc.
[13:55:21] <Yepp> Wish i could.
[13:55:26] <robertmaxrees> errr, why not?
[13:55:31] <Yepp> I would if on the next project
[13:55:44] <Yepp> I'm currently halfway already
[13:55:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd relaly think about bringing it into this project.
[13:55:51] <Yepp> it'll be lots of changes
[13:55:56] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're doing to have bigger and bigger problems.
[13:56:11] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a dom abstraction library, not a webapp framework or anything like that.
[13:56:59] <Yepp> I considered framework first before starting this but I thought this project will be just plain simple and jquery alone can do it
[13:57:05] <Yepp> i didn't expected this to happen
[13:57:15] <Yepp> so... just deal with it
[13:57:21] <robertmaxrees> heh, which is why now is the perfect time to bring in the right tool for the job.
[13:58:27] <Yepp> yea I know what you mean and I even wish I could but if I would, there will be lots of changes and it is running fine already...
[13:58:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:58:44] <Yepp> I'd consider frameworks for my future projects always
[13:58:47] <Yepp> lesson learned
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> except you're already seeing a case where you're having to put in a hack to handle a common case.  but alright :)
[13:59:26] <tables> http://paste2.org/W9XZMC8c  <-- how do i make the page load only when the input button is pressed?
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> tables https://learn.jquery.com/events/handling-events/
[13:59:50] <tables> on submit i want it to load
[14:01:17] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: actually I don't have any problems.. Since this is just a partial view I can just make var options on top then load the partial view that will initialize the form
[14:01:31] <robertmaxrees> heh, goole luck.
[14:01:31] <Yepp> like how it is now without the partial view
[14:01:33] <robertmaxrees> *good
[14:01:54] <Yepp> but might cause some confusion in the future when looking back to the code
[14:02:05] <Yepp> like, wth is this var options?
[14:02:06] <Yepp> lol
[14:06:49] <tables> robertmaxrees: i'm having problems sending fname and lname to the script
[14:06:51] <tables> http://paste2.org/W9XZMC8c
[14:07:13] <tables> i need to send it like /index.php?fname=blah&lname=blahblah
[14:09:03] <robertmaxrees> "send it" how?
[14:09:07] <robertmaxrees> in a form submit?
[14:09:34] <robertmaxrees> have you actually tried reading through the learning center?
[14:09:44] <Simbaclaws> if you're gonna use that in php don't forget to sanitize the input, sqli can be quite a hassle
[14:09:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:10:00] <robertmaxrees> that, too.
[14:10:02] <Simbaclaws> I would use POST though
[14:10:10] <Simbaclaws> cleaner url's ftw
[14:10:15] <robertmaxrees> Simbaclaws his entire idea is really weird.
[14:10:20] <Simbaclaws> ah ok...
[14:10:25] <robertmaxrees> so i'd worry less about that part ;)
[14:10:31] <Simbaclaws> got it :D
[14:15:35] <tables> robertmaxrees: yes through form submit
[14:15:39] <tables> i want it to load
[14:15:44] <tables>  /index.php?fname=blah&lname=blahblah
[14:15:54] <tables> whatever my fname and lname params are
[14:15:57] <robertmaxrees> tables then you want a submit event handler.
[14:16:13] <tables> how do i do that?
[14:16:15] <shoky> why not just let it submit..?
[14:16:21] <robertmaxrees> tables https://learn.jquery.com/events/handling-events/
[14:16:31] <robertmaxrees> shoky because he wants to reload the entire page using ajax.
[14:16:36] <robertmaxrees> i already explained that this was a bad idea.
[14:16:43] <robertmaxrees> but he doesn't want to listen.
[14:16:45] <tables> there's nothing on there that does submit even handler
[14:17:01] <robertmaxrees> tables try reading about events and then going through the learning center.
[14:17:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're programming by proxy ;)
[14:17:12] <tables> where's the learning center?
[14:17:12] <Simbaclaws> surely this depends on whether you want the submit to be handled by the frontend (jquery) or by the backend (php). And since you're in the #jquery channel I think the first applies?
[14:17:19] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[14:17:38] <robertmaxrees> Simbaclaws he'd like to load the content from the given url and replace the contents of the current page.
[14:17:39] <Simbaclaws> I'm sorry for intervening I have no idea what is going on
[14:18:02] <robertmaxrees> nah no big, the concept is strange.
[14:18:12] <tables> what am i supposed to do at the learning center?  can you just show me syntax?
[14:18:12] <Simbaclaws> wait why would you...?
[14:18:23] <robertmaxrees> tables we can help you learn.
[14:18:27] <robertmaxrees> that's what the channel is for.
[14:18:35] <Simbaclaws> I'm confused
[14:18:40] <robertmaxrees> try things out.  when you get stuck, show us what you've tried and we'll point you in the right direction.
[14:18:44] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, go find a freelance.
[14:18:50] <robertmaxrees> *freelancer
[14:18:55] <Simbaclaws> oh gtg guys cya
[14:19:06] <Simbaclaws> have to build some ikea furniture
[14:19:10] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[14:19:13] <Simbaclaws> thanks
[14:21:12] <tables> what do i do at the learning center?
[14:21:19] <robertmaxrees> you read through it and learn jquery.
[14:21:41] <taplar> crazy
[14:21:50] <tables> you can't teach me here?
[14:21:55] <robertmaxrees> we can help guide you.
[14:22:03] <robertmaxrees> i've given you links to some great resources.
[14:22:19] <tables> ok tell me how i would learn the submit thing
[14:22:27] <robertmaxrees> learn about event listeners.
[14:22:29] <tables> where i can submit and load fname and lname
[14:22:51] <robertmaxrees> once you can console.log() that you've submitted the form, come back.
[14:23:16] <tables> how do i even read fname and lname?
[14:23:23] <yottabyte> when I have a deferred object and I do like .done( should I do .done(myFunction()) or .done(myFunction);? I can never get it
[14:23:28] <tables> to console.log() ?
[14:23:32] <robertmaxrees> you can get that data a few different ways tables.
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> yottabyte .then(myFunction);
[14:23:54] <robertmaxrees> yottabyte the other way runs the function and assigns its return as the callback.
[14:24:41] <robertmaxrees> tables baby steps - learn how to bind a submit handler ;)
[14:26:36] <tables> https://api.jquery.com/submit/
[14:26:40] <robertmaxrees> that's another way.
[14:26:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd use the .on() syntax, but sure.
[14:26:48] <tables> there's nothing that shows how i can submit that lname and fname
[14:27:04] <tables> using .on() too, how do i submit lname and fname?
[14:27:06] <robertmaxrees> are you console logging when you submit the form?
[14:27:53] <robertmaxrees> a quick google search for jquery get form data returns a lot of pretty relevant results.
[14:28:12] <tables> $( "input" ).one( "click", function() {
[14:28:18] <tables> now how do i read fname and lname?
[14:28:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .on()
[14:28:19] <robertmaxrees> and no.
[14:28:27] <tables> ah ok
[14:28:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you bind a submit handler.
[14:28:30] <tables> jquery get form data
[14:33:10] <theery> Any idea why this autocomplete is getting submitted the moment I click in the input field? https://gist.githubusercontent.com/macmartine/43c8a077bd6efecf7e5ab7eb7be0aa77/raw/12fb9d01c204f41500974d15cbd8f5e9d057360f/autocomplete.js
[14:33:13] <tek81> $('.descriptions-list ~ select') ... This should get me all the the SELECT elements that are siblings to any other element with the descriptions-list class applied, correct?
[14:33:49] <theery> That is, the onSelect is firing once I click in the input field when there's already a value in there
[14:34:16] <robertmaxrees> tek81 should, yeah.
[14:34:36] <robertmaxrees> theery which autocmplete are you using?
[14:37:55] <tables> $('form').serialize() will give me my lname and fname
[14:38:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:38:07] <tables> how do i then put form serialize into my load?
[14:38:19] <robertmaxrees> you have to construct the url to pass to it.
[14:38:31] <theery> @robertmaxrees just the jquery one
[14:38:40] <theery> robertmaxrees: ^
[14:38:49] <robertmaxrees> theery the jqui one you mean?  do you have a fiddle showing the problem happening?
[14:39:13] <theery> No, I can work on that
[14:39:41] <robertmaxrees> you mean the lookup is firing, right?
[14:40:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  you sure you have that right?  lookup isn't a callback for jqui's autocomplete.  pretty sure the same applies for jqm.
[14:45:03] <tek81> If someone could take a look at https://jsfiddle.net/63nc11b3/1/ that would be great.  End goal is that as the select gains and loses focus, the div should hide/show.
[14:45:12] <tables> http://paste2.org/8n2Ltdnd   <-- how do i make the load spinner work now?
[14:45:21] <tables> check the <div id=spinner>
[14:45:24] <robertmaxrees> tables what do you mean?
[14:45:33] <tables> i need it to have "loading..." in the <div>
[14:45:41] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[14:45:42] <tables> then load the page when it fully loads
[14:45:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:46:03] <tables> i need the loader.gif thing to work now
[14:46:07] <tables> i put "loading..." instead
[14:46:09] <robertmaxrees> oh, you want a gif there?
[14:46:13] <mechanist> hello
[14:46:13] <mechanist> how can I add the t variable to this call sendind the screen.height? ===> xmlhttp.open("GET","ajax.php?s="+screen.width,false);
[14:46:16] <tables> yea i can just put a loading.gif there
[14:46:21] <robertmaxrees> tables sure.
[14:46:51] <tables> now how do i make the "loading..." thing work
[14:46:52] <tables> ?
[14:46:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean hide and show it?
[14:47:06] <tables> i don't know
[14:47:12] <tables> i want the loading thing to work now
[14:47:13] <taplar> tek81: https://jsfiddle.net/63nc11b3/2/
[14:47:16] <tables> what do i do in jquery?
[14:47:23] <robertmaxrees> tables stop repating yourself and clarify.
[14:47:24] <tables> to make "loading..." work
[14:48:29] <tek81> taplar: Thanks for that, though I am still curious why the method I was using isn't working.
[14:48:42] <robertmaxrees> tek81 because the selector wasn't selecting anything.
[14:48:46] <robertmaxrees> tables clarify what you want.
[14:49:09] <MassDebates> howdy fellas, trying to help someone out with their jquery, but I'm not sure what to refer to something as to tell him what the issue is
[14:49:27] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates hrm?  could you clarify"?
[14:49:58] <MassDebates> Sure thing, still typing :)
[14:50:03] <rokshis> Yes
[14:50:03] <MassDebates> I played with jQuery a bit but this is a bit deep for me regarding the library. He's got a div that he can scroll using the scroll wheel. The scroll is X-axis, not your standard Y axis. It's a div with overflow.
[14:50:04] <rokshis> I am here.
[14:50:30] <MassDebates> The containing div's children overflows the div, as I've said, along the X-axis
[14:50:39] <robertmaxrees> were you helping rokshis? :)
[14:52:14] <rokshis> robertmaxrees, yes, it's me :P
[14:52:25] <robertmaxrees> share the codepen then.
[14:52:31] <rokshis> Still the same
[14:52:32] <rokshis> https://codepen.io/rokshis/pen/GqzZNy
[14:52:33] <robertmaxrees> the plugin is what's causing your headaches.
[14:52:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, but for other people.
[14:52:40] <rokshis> You mean the custom scrollbar?
[14:52:44] <robertmaxrees> somebody else might be able to help.
[14:53:00] <robertmaxrees> yes, the plugin that you're loading that's handling the x-axis scrolling dealio.
[14:53:10] <rokshis> Also, I think i just figured out a way to fix this. When I use <div> instead of a button, it doesn't do this weird'o scrolling.
[14:53:18] <rokshis> Strange.
[14:53:22] <robertmaxrees> not really that strange.
[14:53:31] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the plugin has special handling for buttons.
[14:53:42] <robertmaxrees> or bootstrap is doing something funky with them.
[14:53:46] <rokshis> MassDebates, if you didn't read it.
[14:53:48] <MassDebates> Shit, I didn't know I got disconnected
[14:53:53] <rokshis> Also, I think i just figured out a way to fix this. When I use <div> instead of a button, it doesn't do this weird'o scrolling.
[14:53:54] <MassDebates> The reason why is because the browser doesn't recognize the div scrolling to the right through its overflow when someone scrolls to the right.
[14:54:11] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates lol we already looked at the problem before.
[14:54:22] <MassDebates> In other words, nothing is notifying/telling the browser that it's being scrolled through the div
[14:54:24] <robertmaxrees> the bug is caused by the plugin being used to handle the horizontal scroll.
[14:54:24] <MassDebates> Oh
[14:54:36] <rokshis> But we haven't found a real fix :P
[14:54:39] <MassDebates> I don't think it's a 'bug' from the browser
[14:54:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:54:48] <MassDebates> I think it's just a shitty issue with the plugin.
[14:54:48] <robertmaxrees> it's something in the plugin.
[14:54:50] <MassDebates> Yeah.
[14:54:51] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:54:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:55:04] <robertmaxrees> i reached the same conclusion hours ago :)
[14:55:08] <MassDebates> Oh wtf
[14:55:17] <MassDebates> rokshis:  why didn't you say that before
[14:55:28] <robertmaxrees> they were in here asking for help earlier.
[14:55:28] <rokshis> MassDebates, well, I talked with you before him :P
[14:55:32] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:55:43] <MassDebates> oh
[14:55:44] <rokshis> and also, I just thought, that there must be a way out.
[14:55:54] <rokshis> Saying, that it's "plugin issue" doesn't solve the issue.
[14:55:57] <rokshis> :P
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> use a div or something.
[14:55:58] <MassDebates> Yeah, there is; Fixing that shit plugin.
[14:56:03] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:56:14] <rokshis> kek
[14:56:17] <MassDebates> the reason why the button is causing it is because it's a browser-activating element thingy
[14:56:27] <MassDebates> The same thing would happen for things like
[14:56:30] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:56:32] <MassDebates> inputs, links, labels
[14:56:34] <robertmaxrees> i have a doubt for that.
[14:56:47] <MassDebates> Let me go ahead and throw in  a link or label to an input
[14:56:53] <MassDebates> i'll see what happens
[14:56:57] <robertmaxrees> we bound listeners to the elements and they weren't firing at all.
[14:57:07] <robertmaxrees> so the plugin is doing something it shouldn't w/r/t handlers.
[14:58:18] <MassDebates> hm, that's weird, even putting liste
[14:58:28] <MassDebates> Well then
[14:59:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:59:50] <rokshis> So, whats the conclusion? Damn shitty plugin?
[14:59:57] <rokshis> Thats the best custom scrollbar I could find
[14:59:59] <rokshis> :P
[15:00:23] <robertmaxrees> why do you think you want a custom scrollbar?
[15:01:07] <MassDebates> Ah damnit
[15:01:11] <MassDebates> I fell for the X Y problem with this guy
[15:01:37] <robertmaxrees> nah, not really.
[15:01:41] <robertmaxrees> his core problem is legit.
[15:01:53] <robertmaxrees> but the plugin is weird.
[15:02:40] <rokshis> robertmaxrees, because, a normal scrollbar would look so bad on the design.
[15:02:53] <rokshis> Also, this is designers choice.
[15:03:02] <robertmaxrees> then hide the scrollbar and use a carousel (shrug)
[15:03:34] <MassDebates> Why not just make your own and do what the plugin tried to do?
[15:03:46] <robertmaxrees> or tell the designer "what about UX?"
[15:03:57] <tables> $("#myDiv").html('<img src="images/spinner.gif" alt="Wait" />');
[15:03:58] <tables> $('body').load("/index.php"+values);
[15:04:04] <tables> is it really gonna load index.php first?
[15:04:06] <tables> or just show the spinner?
[15:04:11] <tables> before loading?
[15:04:12] <MassDebates> Show spinner
[15:04:18] <tables> i need it to load index.php first
[15:04:21] <tables> can jquery do that?
[15:04:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:04:30] <robertmaxrees> tables hide it with css and then show it when the user submits.
[15:04:45] <tables> but it's supposed to load when i press the submit button
[15:04:56] <robertmaxrees> tables you can show the gif and fire the load.
[15:04:57] <sillyslux> $('body').load(... ?
[15:05:17] <tables> i want the page to preload
[15:05:19] <tables> how do i do that?
[15:05:22] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[15:05:22] <tables> when i press the submit button
[15:05:25] <robertmaxrees> not in a meaningful way.
[15:05:33] <MassDebates> that doesn't work like that
[15:05:33] <MassDebates> you can only like
[15:05:37] <MassDebates> "show" it
[15:05:40] <robertmaxrees> you can use the ajax to inject the content when it's done loading, but not everything.
[15:06:14] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing so far could really easily be done with just plain old javascript fwiw.
[15:06:57] <MassDebates> rokshis:  what was so good about that scrolling plugin in the first place?
[15:07:02] <MassDebates> rokshis:  what were you using from it beofre?
[15:07:56] <rokshis> MassDebates, Well, it has such things, as PreventDefault (which stops the body from scrolling on Y axis, when X axis has reached the end)
[15:08:24] <rokshis> Stepsizing, seemed well documented.
[15:08:41] <rokshis> Just it fits my requirements
[15:08:42] <rokshis> :P
[15:08:46] <MassDebates> Why not just do that on your own, though?
[15:09:05] <rokshis> You mean, why not create your own scrollbar?
[15:09:36] <MassDebates> You're sorta taking a 3000-line monster of what's an apparently poorly-coded script for what can be done in less than 5% of the same length.
[15:09:58] <MassDebates> So I mean why not create your own scrollbar?
[15:10:30] <MassDebates> It's not hard to do.
[15:10:45] <robertmaxrees> because somebody else has already solved that problem.
[15:11:10] <MassDebates> solutions that breed more problems shouldn't be considered solutions.
[15:11:20] <robertmaxrees> then don't use this particualr plugin and find another.
[15:11:22] <robertmaxrees> problem solved :)
[15:11:37] <MassDebates> I don't think he'll find one.
[15:11:50] <robertmaxrees> there are tons available.
[15:12:03] <MassDebates> Besides, he'll be better off with making something simple that he can support later if there's need to change, modify, or add to.
[15:12:21] <MassDebates> Sorry, I don't think he'll find one that he and his designer will be happy with out of the box*
[15:12:41] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty easy to tweak the CSS of whatever he does find.
[15:12:53] <robertmaxrees> You can always explore your options and decide then.  if an in-house option winds up being your best choice, go that route.
[15:13:01] <tables> http://paste2.org/bKzw93Gf  <-- the spinner doesn't show
[15:13:03] <tables> what's wrong?
[15:13:13] <tables> does it actually show but i'm loading to quick?
[15:13:27] <robertmaxrees> there's no gif sooo...
[15:13:41] <robertmaxrees> and does the content of the page still swap out?
[15:13:42] <tables> it should show "Loading..." though
[15:13:51] <tables> yes
[15:13:54] <taplar> logic is before the body tag, outside of any doc ready
[15:13:55] <tables> it replaces body the load does
[15:13:57] <robertmaxrees> does it swap out quickly?
[15:14:02] <tables> yes quickly
[15:14:07] <robertmaxrees> then there's your answer.
[15:14:14] <tables> it's swapping too quick?
[15:14:20] <robertmaxrees> probably?
[15:14:28] <tables> how do i do a sleep?
[15:14:29] <robertmaxrees> i have literally no way of knowing without seeing it.
[15:14:30] <tables> to tell?
[15:14:32] <robertmaxrees> don't.
[15:14:35] <MassDebates> Loading too fast, Mates?
[15:14:45] <tables> so the spinner is actually showing?
[15:14:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:14:48] <MassDebates> Solution: Load more porn.
[15:14:50] <robertmaxrees> probably?
[15:14:57] <skokkkk> hey there, is there a way to directly input text into an html property (eg. name=server<?php echo counter;?>)
[15:15:01] <MassDebates> Also, you'll need to instruct your users to do so.
[15:15:04] <robertmaxrees> tables how in the world are se supposed to know without actually seeing it?
[15:15:13] <tables> can i do a sleep
[15:15:14] <tables> to tell?
[15:15:15] <taplar> logic is before the body tag, outside of any doc ready
[15:15:17] <tables> how do i sleep in jquery?
[15:15:33] <MassDebates> It's best to assume sleeps don't exist.
[15:15:37] <robertmaxrees> tables you can use settimeout.
[15:15:42] <MassDebates> This isn't Qbasic
[15:15:43] <robertmaxrees> but this is a really silly exercize.
[15:15:49] <robertmaxrees> comment out the load stuff instead.
[15:15:53] <robertmaxrees> verify the stuff changes.
[15:16:00] <robertmaxrees> skokkkk you eman using jquery?
[15:16:05] <MassDebates> Why not just have him run it until can be checked?
[15:16:05] <MassDebates> Oh cmon
[15:16:14] <MassDebates> SERIOUSLY
[15:16:14] <MassDebates> this guy's like psychic
[15:16:14] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:16:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:16:23] <MassDebates> I'm 0 for 3
[15:16:24] * robertmaxrees slaps w0ng around a bit with a large trout
[15:16:26] <skokkkk> robertmaxrees: yes?
[15:16:26] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[15:16:31] <taplar> lol
[15:16:34] <robertmaxrees> skokkkk yeah, you can .append()
[15:17:01] <skokkkk> robertmaxrees: can you show me an example please?
[15:17:17] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/9392806
[15:17:31] <robertmaxrees> skokkkk ^
[15:17:36] <robertmaxrees> lots of stuff out there for it.
[15:17:59] <robertmaxrees> even better: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[15:26:13] <skokkkk> hi there. every time I press the html input button on line 63 I want the text for the "name" field to change on 53-55 (eg server_name1 becomes server_name2)
[15:26:26] <robertmaxrees> gotta link the code, too :)
[15:28:33] <skokkkk> https://paste.ee/p/xnTwa
[15:28:35] <skokkkk> oops
[15:28:47] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:28:53] <robertmaxrees> make a functioning jsfiddle instead :)
[15:29:31] <robertmaxrees> like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/804vq6qo/
[15:30:20] <robertmaxrees> and if I were you, i'd swap that .html() to a .clone() instead.
[15:30:39] <robertmaxrees> then you can do what you'd normally do when modifying elements with jquery.
[15:32:44] <skokkkk> robertmaxrees: will that one work?
[15:32:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:36:44] <skokkkk> robertmaxrees: is there a way I can change that "name" field and increment it for every time the .click function happens
[15:36:48] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:37:08] <skokkkk> robertmaxrees: mind enlightening me on this way?
[15:38:40] <robertmaxrees> sure - give them each a class like server_name or we.
[15:38:57] <robertmaxrees> then $currentClone.find('.server_name').prop('server_name' + counter);
[15:39:00] <robertmaxrees> etc
[15:39:46] <skokkkk> I need the names though because it's a form that's getting submitted
[15:39:54] <robertmaxrees> right, so you're using both.
[15:40:25] <robertmaxrees> you're just adding the class to make it easy to find the relevant inputs.
[15:41:23] <skokkkk> let me test this
[15:58:51] <mark36ph> hi all. i have a list of data from a database, and there is 1600 rows. is there a way i can limit this and use a jquery drop down box to select a letter and have all the data starting with that data show?
[16:00:04] <taplar> most likely your going to want some sort of autocomplete/autosuggest logic that would retrieve the results from the back end
[16:00:13] <taplar> you don't really want to return 1600 rows to your frontend
[16:00:34] <taplar> unless the amount of data is super small
[16:01:33] <mark36ph> The data is just 4 characters each
[16:03:01] <taplar> ok, so sure you could do that.  you could do that with a normal dropdown even
[16:23:33] <devslash> i have a click event that looks like this: http://pastebin.com/6VuMFY3d on the line iframe.attr('src',$('li .selected', this).attr('href')); I want to load the content using a fade in effect. is it possible to do this with an iframe ?
[16:26:49] <robertmaxrees> devslash you mean fade in the iframe?>
[16:27:03] <devslash> yes
[16:27:14] <robertmaxrees> you could put a div over the iframe and fade that out.
[17:10:38] <NaN> how can I catch all 'wheel' event's even if they happend inside an iframe? is it possible?
[17:11:24] <robertmaxrees> $('iframe').on('wheel', function() {}); might work.
[17:11:25] <NaN> $(window).on('mousewheel') is working only for current document and not iframes
[17:11:54] <robertmaxrees> not sure if event bubbling accross documents would be a problem or not.
[17:12:03] <taplar> $('iframe').add(window)... ?
[17:13:06] <NaN> robertmaxrees: $('iframe').on ... didn't work
[17:13:11] <NaN> add()?
[17:13:28] <robertmaxrees> .add() ?
[17:13:40] <taplar> is it add or and
[17:13:40] <taplar> ?
[17:13:56] <robertmaxrees> He wants the iframe contents.
[17:13:58] <robertmaxrees> not to do both.
[17:14:09] <taplar> oh
[17:14:20] <taplar> i thought he wanted scroll events for both
[17:14:44] <robertmaxrees> maybe $('iframe').contents().find('body').on() ?
[17:14:51] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, might be a cors issue.
[17:14:52] <NaN> actually I need to test if the div container of the iFrame has a class, something like $elementInsideIframe.parents('.classname')
[17:14:59] <NaN> but I need to check on wheel
[17:15:48] <NaN> thing is if I add the wheel event to window it doesn't know about $elementInsideIframe, event doesn't register any iframe content at all
[17:16:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:16:23] <robertmaxrees> try the .contents() thing i suggest.
[17:16:26] <robertmaxrees> *suggested
[17:16:33] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, you may be SOL
[17:16:35] <NaN> thanks robertmaxrees , let me try
[17:16:41] <NaN> SOL?
[17:16:48] <robertmaxrees> shit outta luck
[17:16:53] <NaN> Hahaha ok
[17:19:50] <NaN> I'm SOL
[17:19:54] <NaN> :/
[17:20:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, reaching across iframes is kind of a weird proposition.
[17:20:12] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?
[17:20:34] <NaN> ads... thise little beatches are loaded inside iframes
[17:20:42] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:20:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with them?
[17:22:42] <NaN> I need to check if parent div container has a class to work with the container (on wheel), everything is working, except for when I do wheel and my cursor is inside an ad
[17:23:06] <robertmaxrees> right, why?
[17:23:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:23:31] <NaN> event 'bubbling' I suppose
[17:23:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:23:57] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, nevermind - i reread that.
[17:24:06] <robertmaxrees> why not listen to the window scroll event insteaD?
[17:24:11] <NaN> my global event doesn't get registered inside iframes
[17:24:20] <NaN> it's what I'm doing, $(window).on('wheel')
[17:24:27] <robertmaxrees> whell and scroll are different.
[17:24:30] <robertmaxrees> *wheel
[17:24:47] <robertmaxrees> do you actually need the wheel event?  or do you care about when thw window scrolls?
[17:24:50] <NaN> actually I'm doing 'DOMMouseScroll mousewheel'
[17:25:01] <robertmaxrees> scroll is neither of those./
[17:25:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:25:30] <NaN> Ok I'll try with scroll, only to see if it get's registered inside the iFrame
[17:25:42] <robertmaxrees> it probably won't.
[17:26:00] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm still confused about what you're trying to fix.
[17:26:28] <robertmaxrees> other than the fact that the scroll may not actually function inside the iframe.
[17:27:49] <NaN> it didn't
[17:27:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:27:55] <robertmaxrees> not surprising.
[17:28:22] <NaN> :/
[17:28:45] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) lots of ad serving setups are protective over those iframes.
[17:28:49] <robertmaxrees> not terribly surprising.
[17:29:21] <NaN> I suppose
[17:29:26] <NaN> like a sandbox
[17:29:45] <robertmaxrees> gotta protect against people trying to falsify clicks and stuff.
[17:31:28] <NaN> same origin... I'm reading about
[17:31:38] <robertmaxrees> are you getting CORS errors in the console?
[17:32:13] <NaN> not at all
[17:32:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm.,
[17:32:37] <NaN> but same origin policy works on iframe with content from another domain too
[17:32:52] <robertmaxrees> right, but you'd be getting CORS errors if that were a case.
[17:35:09] <NaN> 'if the iframe contains a page that does not belong to the same domain as the iframe parent, any interaction is prohibited'
[17:35:17] <NaN> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3690896/2446726
[17:35:17] <robertmaxrees> unless the remote server allows it.
[17:35:39] <robertmaxrees> which it often can/does
[17:35:41] <NaN> we are talking about ads, from an ad network, I doubt they allow it
[17:35:47] <robertmaxrees> probably not.
[19:09:24] * robertmaxrees yawn
[19:56:56] <z1haze1> Any backbone users in here?
[19:57:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:57:06] <z1haze1> woohoo
[19:57:30] <z1haze1> so ive been digging into it more lately finally got my first collection showing up on the page last night lol but i have questions, of course
[19:57:47] <robertmaxrees> before you get started :)
[19:57:51] <z1haze1> please dont leave
[19:57:54] <robertmaxrees> have you asked in #documentcloud
[19:57:57] <z1haze1> oh yea
[19:57:59] <robertmaxrees> and i will have to leave soonish.
[19:58:01] <z1haze1> look in there
[19:58:10] <z1haze1> i ask questions 5 days in advance not one person says a word
[19:58:20] <robertmaxrees> heh, just making sure.
[19:58:48] <z1haze1> well first question isnt really related to backbone specifically, but im trying to figure out how to structure my application using require js
[19:58:53] <z1haze1> do you have experience in that way?
[19:58:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:59:14] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you really want to be in ##javascript for that one.
[19:59:34] <z1haze1> Ok, so in my main.js file i basically just have my require config and then a simple define calling my app file, then run an app.initialize to kick it all off
[19:59:53] <z1haze1> BUT what i cant wrap my head around, is how do i still keep this modular without throwing everything into app.js
[20:00:07] <robertmaxrees> there a hierarchy between components?
[20:00:17] <robertmaxrees> because at the end of the day, that's eventually what happens.
[20:00:47] <z1haze1> well i mean, im only working on my first 'widget' on my dashboard and i already have like 10 defines in the app.js file
[20:01:14] <robertmaxrees> of your dependencies, right?
[20:01:23] <z1haze1> i guess I just dont understand the logic behind it all - i'm willing to pay for a decent lesson to get a lightbulb to turn on
[20:01:28] <z1haze1> yea
[20:01:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah. that sounds about right.
[20:01:47] <robertmaxrees> though are you using requirejs or something like that?
[20:01:54] <z1haze1> exactly
[20:02:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so that's basically what you'll do.
[20:02:22] <robertmaxrees> though I might define dependencies on the specific modules you've got.
[20:02:26] <robertmaxrees> but you get the basic idea.
[20:02:35] <z1haze1> but i mean in my anonymous callback in my app.js thers already like 10 things being fed it, and im like 1% through my product
[20:02:45] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[20:02:59] <z1haze1> http://dpaste.com/37P68MZ
[20:03:18] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:03:24] <robertmaxrees> that's about right.
[20:03:39] <robertmaxrees> though I might look into shim configs.
[20:03:40] <z1haze1> this feels more complicated than just concatting all my js files into a single script
[20:03:51] <robertmaxrees> so you're conflating the point :)
[20:03:59] <z1haze1> ah
[20:04:05] <robertmaxrees> requirejs can manage those dependencies for you
[20:04:11] <robertmaxrees> do you understand why that's important?
[20:04:23] <z1haze1> i mean, somewhat?
[20:04:35] <z1haze1> you still have to specify dependencies
[20:04:45] <robertmaxrees> right, but you shouldn't worry about the how.
[20:05:02] <z1haze1> i was thinking today at work, would it be better to make a module called like dashboard, and then have an init method thats initializes that in my app.js?
[20:05:18] <robertmaxrees> other way around.
[20:05:23] <robertmaxrees> your app would init the dashboard.
[20:05:31] <robertmaxrees> the dashboard might init widgets.js
[20:05:31] <z1haze1> its a bummer because all of the use scenarios online only demonstrate a simple task app that have like a single model
[20:05:45] <robertmaxrees> we're using it for our new ecommerce platform.
[20:05:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:05:57] <z1haze1> so its definitely scaleable then
[20:06:02] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.
[20:06:12] <z1haze1> my goal is to learn this really well and teach my people at work during the code freeze
[20:06:17] <z1haze1> because we need to fix our mess
[20:06:22] <robertmaxrees> and the production build process can still smack everything down into one file
[20:06:25] <robertmaxrees> or limited files.
[20:07:07] <z1haze1> ok, so heres my basic scenario for this first dashboard page - it has probably 10 different widgets, all will have their own collections of models and views
[20:07:17] <z1haze1> what is the best way with requirejs to do this
[20:07:36] <robertmaxrees> each widget defines the generic models, etc. that they need.
[20:07:55] <z1haze1> my in what i showed you
[20:08:01] <z1haze1> the only thing ive built so far is my feeds widget
[20:08:19] <robertmaxrees> right, so the generic stuff, right?  like jquery, lodash, etc?  those down't get specified for each.
[20:08:21] <z1haze1> its just a simple widget that displays a list a revisions from the database
[20:08:25] <robertmaxrees> or they do, depending on how you do it.
[20:08:32] <z1haze1> currently, they do
[20:08:43] <robertmaxrees> right, you have a choice.
[20:08:57] <z1haze1> the model defines backbone, lodash, and jquery, same goes for the views and colections
[20:09:04] <z1haze1> i wish i knew better
[20:09:12] <robertmaxrees> technically your views would define jquery.
[20:09:21] <robertmaxrees> since your models shouldn't be interacting with the DOM.
[20:09:24] <z1haze1> yea thats probably it
[20:10:17] <z1haze1> so http://dpaste.com/2FWVSW5 ive updated this to my actual app.js now
[20:10:46] <robertmaxrees> erm
[20:10:50] <robertmaxrees> have you learned about views yet?
[20:11:12] <z1haze1> ive take a couple online courses on it, so i get the gist of it
[20:11:15] <robertmaxrees> because you're misapplying collections there.
[20:11:18] <z1haze1> ah
[20:11:31] <z1haze1> i couldnt quite figure out how to use a template for my collection and a template for each model
[20:11:49] <robertmaxrees> so your views would call your models/collections.
[20:12:12] <z1haze1> so i dont instantiate a collection here?
[20:12:50] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/examples/backbone_require/js/main.js
[20:12:51] <robertmaxrees> check this oput.
[20:15:13] <robertmaxrees> then look at https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/examples/backbone_require/js/views/app.js
[20:15:16] <robertmaxrees> like, follow this example.
[20:16:00] <robertmaxrees> but the idea is you have your base view, which instantiates your collections (or models, depending).
[20:16:04] <robertmaxrees> collections can contain models.
[20:16:22] <robertmaxrees> the view asks the collections/models for data, and then interact with the DOM.
[20:16:32] <robertmaxrees> the collections/models should never touch the DOM.
[20:16:37] <z1haze1> ok perfect example
[20:16:40] <z1haze1> he does a new AppView()
[20:16:43] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:16:44] <z1haze1> which is a single view
[20:16:47] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:16:49] <z1haze1> i have a ton of views
[20:16:51] <z1haze1> well, will have
[20:17:07] <robertmaxrees> are they actually different though?
[20:17:15] <robertmaxrees> or could you say that they can be logically grouped?
[20:17:22] <robertmaxrees> and that you're simply feeding them different data?
[20:17:39] <z1haze1> ill show you what im working with, its just a template offline http://demo.flatlogic.com/3.3.1/dark/index.html
[20:17:46] <z1haze1> so yea they are all different
[20:18:15] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't be so sure :)
[20:18:26] <z1haze1> i mean the modules/widgets
[20:18:38] <z1haze1> feed is completely different from the thing tabs below it
[20:18:48] <z1haze1> the charts are different than the table below it
[20:18:52] <robertmaxrees> I see a graph view that can be used in a few places, a form view that can have a ton of inputs in it, a user view, a tabview.
[20:19:24] <robertmaxrees> so you're thinking in terms of "widget" - a widget is a view, but views can have other views in them :)
[20:19:37] <z1haze1> i came from wordpress that term just kinda stuck
[20:20:03] <z1haze1> but yea, that feed thing is what i am trying to build with backbone now
[20:20:11] <robertmaxrees> right but
[20:20:11] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/pcAQLup.png
[20:20:26] <robertmaxrees> those three things?
[20:20:32] <robertmaxrees> that could be one view.
[20:21:53] <z1haze1> https://gyazo.com/0ae2c76a6cbb98628c330cef8a4752f6
[20:22:16] <robertmaxrees> that could technically be the same view.
[20:22:31] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you want to slice and dice.
[20:22:39] <z1haze1> can we work through this example though since its what im doing all wrong
[20:22:50] <z1haze1> i made a 'feeds' view and a 'feed' view
[20:23:05] <z1haze1> basically laid out in the red boxes
[20:23:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd direct you to ##javascript but something tells me some folks won't be very helpful and i don't have time right now to really walk you through it :/
[20:23:24] <z1haze1> crap ok
[20:23:41] <z1haze1> want some extra $ do a training session after work
[20:23:41] <robertmaxrees> just try restructuring what you have in the way i suggested.
[20:23:43] <robertmaxrees> go there.
[20:23:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't afford me :)
[20:23:52] <z1haze1> haha
[20:23:54] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:23:54] <z1haze1> ill try
[20:23:58] <z1haze1> only need a jumpstart
[20:24:07] <robertmaxrees> plus this is the wrong place to offer money
[20:24:24] <robertmaxrees> either way, give it a try.  look at that todomvc example.
[20:24:29] <z1haze1> ah, well i know you know you're stuff
[20:24:43] <z1haze1> you and like.. 2 other people in this channel answer 99% of the questions
[20:25:05] <z1haze1> but before you go i have that questions about having a view for the outside and views for the inside
[20:25:21] <z1haze1> all the todo examples just do $append()
[20:25:22] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[20:25:27] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:25:30] <z1haze1> and since im using templates i wont be appending
[20:25:31] <robertmaxrees> i would do that for now.
[20:25:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'd let handlebars handle the templating for you.
[20:26:05] <z1haze1> but how do i get it to where it needs to do
[20:26:15] <z1haze1> the render method has to do something to the dom right
[20:26:31] <robertmaxrees> render is just a convention.  you could call handlebars with it instead.
[20:27:25] <robertmaxrees> the view could just take care of your event bindings + nabbing data.
[20:27:42] <z1haze1> what do you mean by call handlebars with it instead
[20:27:51] <z1haze1> im clearly using that incorreclty too
[20:27:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:28:13] <robertmaxrees> so do you know what the point of a templating engine is?
[20:28:24] <z1haze1> as to not muck up your js?
[20:28:36] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:28:45] <robertmaxrees> it's so you can pass data to it and get back html.
[20:28:49] <robertmaxrees> right?
[20:29:20] <z1haze1> yea, well i meant instead of $('div').append('<div class="something">then some stuff <span></span></div>') etc etc
[20:29:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:29:33] <z1haze1> here's my single feed item view http://dpaste.com/3G8ATQK
[20:29:36] <robertmaxrees> so same idea.  pass handlebars data, replace elements in the document.
[20:29:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah exactly.
[20:29:55] <z1haze1> am i way off on this
[20:30:00] <robertmaxrees> nope, that part is right.
[20:30:05] <z1haze1> finally
[20:30:24] <z1haze1> i dont really undersstand my render part in this though
[20:30:31] <z1haze1> its setting this.$el's html
[20:30:35] <z1haze1> but not really doing anythning with it
[20:30:45] <robertmaxrees> just a convention.
[20:30:47] <robertmaxrees> you could call that anything.
[20:30:57] <robertmaxrees> just nice to have a this.render() you can call when everyuthing is said and done.
[20:31:11] <z1haze1> but what is  this.$el.html(... doing
[20:31:29] <robertmaxrees> this.$el is the jquery object that the view is bound to.
[20:31:30] <z1haze1> most of the render methods end in an append()
[20:31:49] <robertmaxrees> there's either an el: in the view itself, you you pass an el option when you initialize.
[20:32:14] <z1haze1> righti think i do that with my collection view
[20:32:31] <robertmaxrees> where you do like new someView({el: '.someSelector'}); ?
[20:32:32] <z1haze1> well i dont pass it in, i just define it in the view
[20:32:39] <robertmaxrees> sure.  either/or.
[20:32:46] <robertmaxrees> this.$el is just the jquerified element.
[20:32:49] <z1haze1> ok so i have these 2 views
[20:32:54] <z1haze1> parent and child i guess you can say
[20:33:07] <z1haze1> what is the proper way to get them on the page
[20:33:21] <z1haze1> because it seems just my implementation is wrong
[20:33:22] <robertmaxrees> you initialize them from your main view.
[20:33:30] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to have a base view.
[20:33:44] <z1haze1> my app view would be like the whole page, yea?
[20:33:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:33:50] <z1haze1> or just the right side window?
[20:33:58] <z1haze1> basically anything that can change
[20:34:16] <robertmaxrees> depends.  we have the entire window as the element for our base view.
[20:34:35] <z1haze1> i bought this template a while back thinking i could learn backbone from it, but its hardly backbone anything, the whole templte is put together with jquery and pjax and they call it backbone
[20:34:53] <robertmaxrees> link again?
[20:34:56] <robertmaxrees> i can take another look.
[20:35:04] <z1haze1> http://demo.flatlogic.com/3.3.1/dark/index.html
[20:35:09] <robertmaxrees> and never buy anything to learn an OSS framework.
[20:35:30] <z1haze1> i was impressed with the design aspect and the fact that it used backbone which i wanted to learn
[20:37:50] <z1haze1> anyhow, I will continue to play with this, and maybe push my home code to  repo i can view from work and try to hop on irc there
[20:37:54] <z1haze1> thanks for the insight
[20:37:56] <robertmaxrees> ah
[20:38:01] <robertmaxrees> the backbone stuff is for the chat.
[20:38:02] <robertmaxrees> btw
[20:38:04] <z1haze1> yea
[20:38:06] <z1haze1> i realized that
[20:38:14] <z1haze1> thats probably the only thing too
[20:38:22] <robertmaxrees> i was trying to figure out wtf they were using bb for hahaha
[20:38:29] <robertmaxrees> either way, you'll figure it out.
[20:39:23] <z1haze1> so does it have to use restful links
[20:39:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:39:33] <robertmaxrees> you can specify whatever structure you'd like.
[20:39:35] <z1haze1> how do i set a single link
[20:39:35] <robertmaxrees> i do that all the time.
[20:39:42] <robertmaxrees> "set a single link" for what?
[20:39:45] <robertmaxrees> api endpoints?
[20:39:47] <z1haze1> for this feed thing the only thing i need is those 2 buttons like in the mock
[20:39:53] <z1haze1> one to load all feed items
[20:40:03] <z1haze1> and the load more is just going to paginate pages using add
[20:40:06] <z1haze1> instead of replace
[20:40:06] <robertmaxrees> you could make the href literally nothing.
[20:40:19] <robertmaxrees> and use the events object in the view
[20:40:52] <z1haze1> so clicking load more i basically need to make a call to like ?page=nextPage
[20:40:59] <robertmaxrees> via ajax, yeah?
[20:41:01] <z1haze1> and then update the nextPage var and add in the next pages stuff
[20:41:02] <z1haze1> yep
[20:41:03] <robertmaxrees> that url would be defined in your model.\
[20:41:19] <z1haze1> but i wont be doing a traditional $.load though will i?
[20:41:30] <z1haze1> dont i need to update the collection
[20:41:35] <z1haze1> and then the collection with update the dom
[20:41:37] <z1haze1> or somerthging like that
[20:41:41] <robertmaxrees> never.
[20:41:45] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:41:48] <robertmaxrees> never use $.load
[20:41:54] <z1haze1> yea i figured
[20:41:58] <robertmaxrees> you could ask the collection for the appropriate model.
[20:42:01] <robertmaxrees> or ask the aprticular model.
[20:42:03] <robertmaxrees> eithger/or.
[20:42:17] <robertmaxrees> then the model returns the data.
[20:42:23] <z1haze1> so events: { click .load-more : loadMore } then i have a loadMore function that does what?
[20:42:34] <z1haze1> this is in the collection view btw
[20:42:44] <robertmaxrees> "collection view" makes no sense ;)
[20:42:47] <robertmaxrees> is it in the view?
[20:42:54] <z1haze1> hmm, thats how id been learning it
[20:42:58] <z1haze1> i have a view for a single model
[20:43:02] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[20:43:03] <z1haze1> and i have a view for a collection of models
[20:43:44] <z1haze1> basically the "Feed 412 show all, and the load more are all part of the collection view
[20:43:49] <robertmaxrees> sec
[20:43:51] <z1haze1> and each model is a single feed view
[20:44:25] <z1haze1> ok
[20:45:26] <robertmaxrees> so collections of models are for cases where you have, say, the same model that you need to instantiate more than once, right?
[20:45:44] <robertmaxrees> but there's a single token that's different between them, like an ID.
[20:45:53] <z1haze1> yep
[20:46:58] <robertmaxrees> right, so make sure you're not misapplying collections in this case :) so! one way to do this is to grab the particular model you want and then .fetch() from there.
[20:47:42] <robertmaxrees> so your click handler would call the model's fetch, and you'd have a .then() off that to handle the DOM updates or whatever.
[20:47:44] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[20:47:46] <z1haze1> so what part of this setup takes care of keeping the dom updated with the correct number of models
[20:47:53] <robertmaxrees> the view.
[20:48:00] <z1haze1> what view for the collection of items, right?
[20:48:15] <robertmaxrees> a view can be for either or both.
[20:48:18] <robertmaxrees> or neither, shit.
[20:48:46] <z1haze1> http://dpaste.com/220R79W here is my main view, same as before
[20:48:52] <z1haze1> my brain cant connect the dots
[20:48:59] <z1haze1> so frustrating
[20:49:08] <robertmaxrees> because you're overcomplicating it.
[20:49:10] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[20:49:16] <z1haze1> i tend to do that
[20:52:13] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/eca4cd4255f6
[20:52:22] <robertmaxrees> i think this is where you're getting confused.
[20:52:29] <robertmaxrees> you actually have to call render() manully.
[20:52:32] <robertmaxrees> *manually
[20:53:34] <robertmaxrees> that make a bit more sense?
[20:53:43] <z1haze1> it does, a bit
[20:53:56] <z1haze1> is it a convention to name methods with _
[20:54:12] <robertmaxrees> it's one way to hint that method is private.
[20:54:17] <z1haze1> ohh
[20:54:20] <robertmaxrees> so external views and stuff avoid using.
[20:54:24] <robertmaxrees> 'cause javascript and all that.
[20:54:26] <z1haze1> i see
[20:54:43] <robertmaxrees> anyway, i really gotta get going.  any other questions?
[20:54:52] <z1haze1> ok so this basically just refetches the main collection
[20:55:00] <z1haze1> oh tons man, not enough time left on earth
[20:55:02] <robertmaxrees> *model
[20:55:13] <z1haze1> how do i get the next set
[20:55:16] <robertmaxrees> you could do the collection instead.
[20:55:16] <z1haze1> of models
[20:55:18] <robertmaxrees> "next set"?
[20:55:27] <z1haze1> lets say my server call is a paginated colection
[20:55:34] <z1haze1> i append a ?page query param
[20:55:39] <robertmaxrees> your server is responding with json.
[20:55:44] <z1haze1> correct
[20:55:53] <robertmaxrees> that json you pass back through your render call.
[20:56:04] <z1haze1> how do i make the call to the new url
[20:56:12] <z1haze1> because i will have to update that query param
[20:56:21] <z1haze1> ?page=1, ?page=2, etc
[20:56:22] <robertmaxrees> if you were going through a collection, you have to access the particular model you care about.
[20:56:26] <robertmaxrees> or don't use a collection at all.
[20:56:37] <robertmaxrees> and just a model (which makes much more sense here imo.
[20:56:38] <robertmaxrees> )
[20:56:50] <z1haze1> well the collection urlRoot /feed returns the paginated list at 10 items per page
[20:57:02] <robertmaxrees> the collection returns a set of models fwiw.
[20:57:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:57:03] <z1haze1> but /feed?page=2 returns the second page of 10 items per page
[20:57:11] <z1haze1> but i dont want to replace* the collection
[20:57:14] <z1haze1> i want to add to it
[20:57:19] <robertmaxrees> either way, check out the docs for collections to see how you reduce the set down to the particualr model you're looking for.
[20:57:30] <z1haze1> as to keep previous ones and keep adding to my scroll list
[20:57:42] <z1haze1> anyhow, thanks for the helps ill see if i can be on during the work day. thanks again
[20:57:43] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw the todomvc example should explain all of this.
[20:57:51] <z1haze1> yea im goin to really analyze it
[20:57:53] <robertmaxrees> its probably syncing against localstorage.
[20:57:55] <robertmaxrees> but same idea.
[20:57:56] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[22:40:23] <alturic> Hey guys, if I have a json return from ajax like so: {"result":"error","message":"Email or Password Invalid"}, how can I select the "result" line?
[22:40:38] <alturic> Would I have to put that into an array and THEN do $.each?
[22:45:50] <Yithar> That's how the example seems to do it, but I don't believe that's necessary.
[22:45:51] <Yithar> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[22:47:39] <alturic> I ended up doing: var parsedjson = JSON.parse(response);
[22:48:13] <alturic> Then I can call each one like: if (parsedjson.result == "error") {
[22:48:23] <alturic> I don't know if that's right... but, eh.
[22:48:24] <Yithar> I'm pretty sure it returns an objects so you should be able to access it with parsedjson["result"] or parsedjson.result
[22:48:29] <Yithar> *an object
