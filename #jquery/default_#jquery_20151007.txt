[01:06:05] <Whiskey> Is it somehow anyway i can make jQuery do this for me as i have done whit the example? http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/12/
[01:22:28] <Uhkis> didn't it just do that? ;)
[01:37:51] <Whiskey> No
[01:38:09] <Whiskey> i mean that it adds it automatic and adjust the width
[01:51:33] <pickandmix> can anyone guide me on my jquery .load?
[01:57:36] <lenswipee> How to get "foo" from a string structured like this: ".../.../.../foo"?
[02:01:25] <Uhkis> is it always the last one after /
[02:01:44] <Whiskey> why donÂ´t use regex
[02:08:25] <lenswipee> its always the last one after /
[02:08:55] <Uhkis> string.split('/').slice(-1) should work then
[02:10:06] <lenswipee> what about string.split('/').pop()? which is better?
[02:12:05] <Uhkis> well, pop is a few characters smaller :D
[02:37:01] <jim_j> hi
[02:37:19] <jim_j> is there a specific jquery plugin needed to position a modal on the page?
[02:58:25] <Cork> jim_j: one of the many overlay/dialog plugins should do
[02:58:37] <Cork> or you could just do it manually
[02:58:38] <jim_j> thanks cork
[02:58:56] <Cork> if your already using jquery ui i would recommend there dialog
[03:00:01] <jim_j> I'm trying to place the modal close to where I click but how do I get the 'this' defined?  this is what I have:
[03:00:04] <jim_j>     var offest = $(this).offset();
[03:00:05] <jim_j>     var height = $(this).height();
[03:00:05] <jim_j>     $('#' + key).dialog("option", "position", [offest.left, offest.top+height]);
[03:00:18] <Cork> don't dump code in the channel
[03:00:24] <Cork> make a jsfiddle
[03:00:41] <Cork> also include the scope the code runs in
[03:06:45] <jim_j> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/wahkLzj2/2/
[03:08:02] <Cork> jim_j: where are you calling video_modal_open from?
[03:08:26] <jim_j> Cork, in the href
[03:08:47] <Cork> ugg... don't use javascript: urls...
[03:09:28] <jim_j> so I should use $().click?
[03:11:19] <oojacoboo> anyone know how to check to see if an embed object has fully loaded?
[03:11:33] <oojacoboo> I tried .ready() only to get an error from the browser that it hasn't completed loading
[03:11:50] <Cork> jim_j: https://jsfiddle.net/wahkLzj2/3/
[03:13:10] <jim_j> Cork, nothing is happening when I click on the link...
[03:13:14] <Cork> oojacoboo: embed is gecko only
[03:13:23] <Cork> jim_j: you don't have jquery in the jsfiddle
[03:13:26] <Cork> or jquery ui
[03:13:32] <jim_j> ah
[03:13:37] <oojacoboo> Cork: <embed> is gecko?
[03:14:05] <jim_j> thanks!
[03:15:01] <Cork> jim_j: http://jsfiddle.net/wahkLzj2/4/
[03:15:26] <Cork> oojacoboo: ya, object is the standard element used for embedding
[03:15:32] <jim_j> wow nice, thanks Cork
[03:15:57] <Cork> ppl tend to use embed for none ie just to not have to deal with the different syntaxes used by old ie and the modern browsers
[03:16:04] <oojacoboo> Cork: thanks, can't keep this shit straight and of course, all the code examples I'm reading are back and forth
[03:16:19] <oojacoboo> Cork: this is for pdf, correct?
[03:16:30] <Cork> oojacoboo: just use an iframe
[03:16:43] <Cork> <iframe src="path.pdf"></iframe>
[03:16:47] <oojacoboo> Cork: why?
[03:16:54] <Cork> cause it works in all browsers
[03:17:04] <Cork> and you get a better interaction support
[03:17:19] <oojacoboo> I'll try it
[03:17:51] <Cork> you can use <object> but i'm not sure ie and the rest of the browsers accept the same syntax for that
[03:17:55] <Cork> i'm quite sure they don't
[03:18:22] <Cork> so you would have to use <object -syntax1-><object -syntax2-></object></object>
[03:18:36] <oojacoboo> Cork: then just $("iframe#id").ready()?
[03:18:38] <Cork> instead of just <iframe src=""></iframe>
[03:18:43] <Cork> oojacoboo: .load
[03:18:55] <Cork> oojacoboo: .ready is for dom ready not for external resources
[03:19:24] <Whiskey> Is it somehow anyway i can make jQuery do this for me as i have done whit the example? http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/12/ add the * automatic and do the width automatic
[03:19:26] <Cork> oojacoboo: basically .ready only works on $(document)
[03:19:47] <oojacoboo> Cork: neither ready or load wait until the pdf is finished loading
[03:19:49] <oojacoboo> before firing
[03:20:00] <Cork> Whiskey: you could do it with a border image
[03:20:13] <Cork> oojacoboo: it should
[03:20:22] <Cork> load is fired when the resource is loaded
[03:20:28] <oojacoboo> Cork: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mp905mhcyddxstl/Screenshot%202015-10-07%2003.20.23.png?dl=0
[03:20:29] <Cork> that is explicitly what the event means
[03:20:47] <Whiskey> Cork: ok?
[03:21:09] <Cork> Whiskey: ok what?
[03:21:23] <oojacoboo> Cork: it may have something to do with the printing facility
[03:21:44] <Cork> oojacoboo: pdf isn't a native web language
[03:22:08] <Cork> it has to be handed over to a third party (browsers now days ship with a built in third party but it is still a third party)
[03:22:19] <oojacoboo> yes, I realize
[03:22:21] <oojacoboo> which prob means I need to set a timeout here
[03:22:22] <Whiskey> Cork: not sure what you mean
[03:22:23] <Cork> the load even fires when the browser has fired the plugin
[03:22:26] <Cork> *event
[03:22:39] <Cork> if the plugin needs time to do its things
[03:22:45] <Cork> the dom doesn't know about it
[03:22:47] <oojacoboo> yea
[03:23:01] <Cork> Whiskey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image
[03:24:19] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea, a timeout fixes the issue, I guess that's sufficient
[03:24:21] <oojacoboo> thanks for the help
[03:24:30] <Cork> oojacoboo: no a timer won't work
[03:24:40] <Cork> it will expect things to take x time
[03:24:47] <oojacoboo> Cork: a timer is working, unless I have access to plugin APIs
[03:25:06] <Cork> but if the device gets busy and takes x+1sec you will have a race condition
[03:25:22] <oojacoboo> Cork: it's not a race condition, but it will throw an error
[03:25:24] <Cork> do timers to do things like this is a BAD idea
[03:25:35] <Cork> oojacoboo: that is what a race condition means
[03:25:50] <oojacoboo> Cork: do you have a better idea on how to check for the pdf plugin's load state?
[03:25:55] <Cork> will the thread rendering the pdf complete before or after the timer === race
[03:26:37] <Whiskey> Cork: thats quite smart
[03:27:06] <Cork> oojacoboo: well... you could use pdf.js and render it to a canvas
[03:27:19] <Cork> hmm but that won't help you print...
[03:27:26] <oojacoboo> Cork: I need this in a pdf to preserve accuracy
[03:27:38] <Cork> do you know what plugin will be used?
[03:27:48] <Cork> cause just depending on what ever plugin exist won't work
[03:27:53] <oojacoboo> heh - I think all the browsers use different ones
[03:27:58] <oojacoboo> that's the biggest issue
[03:27:58] <Cork> no
[03:28:04] <Cork> the built in ones are different
[03:28:08] <Cork> but they are just for simple pdfs
[03:28:21] <oojacoboo> I don't want to use a custom plugin
[03:28:35] <Cork> if you really need "preserve accuracy" you basically need to require adobe pdf plugin
[03:28:48] <oojacoboo> pdf in itself is vector form
[03:28:53] <Cork> cause it is the only one supporting drm protected pdfs
[03:29:01] <oojacoboo> I don't think I need adobe beyond the other readers
[03:29:15] <Cork> also pdf.js is what firefox uses so it is a standard lib :)
[03:29:19] <oojacoboo> Cork: I just mean print accuracy - printing on a specific form doc
[03:29:26] <Cork> heck it is developed by them
[03:29:47] <oojacoboo> Cork: sure.  I think you can call print from within a pdf even too
[03:29:49] <oojacoboo> might look into that
[03:30:05] <Cork> oojacoboo: uh, if you need printing accuracy you can't depend on the browser plugin
[03:30:19] <Cork> pdf.js just renders to a canvas and then uses firefox built in page printer
[03:30:29] <oojacoboo> mmm
[03:30:56] <oojacoboo> any ideas on transmitting a pdf direct to a print dialog :/
[03:31:01] <Cork> there is no difference to just loading an image in an html page and printing that
[03:31:05] <oojacoboo> I'm actually base64'ing it
[03:31:06] <Cork> you can't
[03:31:12] <Cork> the browser doesn't understand pdf
[03:31:19] <Cork> that is the hole point
[03:31:27] <Cork> pdf isn't a web standard
[03:31:27] <oojacoboo> I realize that
[03:32:26] <Cork> something that might be worth playing with is to just use an html page instead
[03:32:35] <Cork> you can use svg in the html
[03:32:40] <Cork> for the vector parts
[03:32:48] <Cork> it might be an easier thing to handle
[03:32:49] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea, I can't get rid of all the browser print header/footer quirks
[03:32:52] <oojacoboo> margins, etc
[03:33:03] <Cork> ya, but that is true for pdfs too
[03:33:13] <Cork> unless you use a third party application plugin
[03:33:19] <oojacoboo> in the browser maybe
[03:33:35] <oojacoboo> I guess I could just force these folks to download the pdf... :/
[03:33:40] <Cork> the user can disable those headers, and css4 will have options for it if i remember correctly
[03:33:51] <Cork> but currently you don't have control over that from the web
[03:33:55] <oojacoboo> Cork: not these users :P
[03:34:10] <Cork> oojacoboo: i just listed all options
[03:34:19] <oojacoboo> "disable the what?!"
[03:34:32] <oojacoboo> "It's not working, I clicked the thing"
[03:34:34] <Cork> i never said it was a solution one could use
[03:34:52] <jim_j> Cork, if I have an image as well I want to link to a modal, do I use button or is there a cleaner way?  this is what I did http://jsfiddle.net/wahkLzj2/6/
[03:35:36] <Cork> jim_j: http://jsfiddle.net/wahkLzj2/7/
[03:35:44] <Cork> opps left the end of the button
[03:35:44] <Cork> one min
[03:37:06] <Cork> jim_j: http://jsfiddle.net/wahkLzj2/8/
[03:38:57] <jim_j> ah cool, thanks Cork!
[03:50:43] <zizzl> Hey all, anyone know if this side menu is a plugin http://www.jam3.com/about/ ?
[03:52:17] <serengeor_> Hello
[03:53:24] <serengeor_> I have weird issue with jquery-ui datepicker. When setting min date after creation if the date changes to min date the change event is not fired.
[04:02:03] <serengeor_> http://jsfiddle.net/ebq29rw8/2/
[04:02:18] <serengeor_> seams that even 'setDate' doesn't fire the change event
[04:03:15] <serengeor_> is there some other way to check for changes that might happen?
[04:04:32] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm doing jQuery('body').on('click', '.mytabletable .myaccordion'). And in the accordion I click on an icon. Now I want to check if the icon was clicked. How can I do that?
[04:19:04] <JosefDe> Hi guys. How can I use an and condition: "Is of class1 and class2" in jQuery's ".is()"?
[04:21:59] <JosefDe> This is not working for me: is("span[class*=icon].span:not(.accordionToggleIcon)")
[04:31:03] <lenswipee> trying to undo a e.preventDefault() by unbinding a click event on a submit button. but i find that i had to click the submit button twice before it gives default browser behaviour(HTTP POST).
[04:35:36] <Cork> JosefDe: '.class1.class1'
[04:35:47] <Cork> JosefDe: never ever use class*=
[04:36:09] <Cork> lenswipee: just set disabled on the button
[04:36:14] <Cork> no need to remove the event handler
[04:36:28] <Cork> lenswipee: also don't use click on a button, use submit on the form
[04:37:00] <lenswipee> Cork: Thanks bro
[04:46:26] <lenswipee> Cork: I can disable but not enable as it remains disabled.
[04:46:42] <Cork> lenswipee: let me guess you use attr?
[04:46:45] <Cork> :)
[04:46:47] <Cork> don't
[04:46:56] <Cork> use .prop unless you actually need to use attr
[04:47:04] <Cork> (and you most of the time don't)
[04:47:13] <lenswipee> Cork: $('submit').prop('disabled', true)
[04:47:24] <Cork> submit isn't an element
[04:47:53] <mooncup> it'd be :submit right?
[04:47:59] <Cork> you prob want $(this).find('button').prop('disabled', true)
[04:48:11] <lenswipee> Cork: $('input[name="submit"]').prop('disabled', true)
[04:48:24] <Cork> though you prob want to limit it to the form your in
[04:48:53] <Cork> so for a submit even $(this).find(':submit').prop('disabled', true)
[04:49:00] <Cork> *event
[04:49:01] <raj> does Rule #4 apply for the JQuery ajax request as well? http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/the-definitive-guide-to-get-vs-post
[04:49:50] <Cork> raj: ajax is just that it is done by javascript
[04:50:07] <Cork> it still follows the same verbs in normal http requests
[04:50:31] <raj> But it's faster?
[04:50:38] <raj> to use GET
[04:51:36] <Cork> not really
[04:51:52] <Cork> get can hit the cache so it can get data without having to access the server
[04:52:01] <Cork> but if both hit the server they are the same speed
[04:52:06] <raj> I see
[04:52:09] <raj> thank you for that
[04:52:54] <Cork> raj: there is actually much less differencing get and post then most ppl think
[04:53:47] <Cork> the only thing it really does is tell proxies to not cache the data, and it tells the server to look in the body instead of the url
[04:53:56] <Cork> both get and post have an url and a body though
[04:54:03] <raj> K
[04:54:20] <Cork> so a post url with no body content and params in the url is very much the same as a get request
[04:54:27] <raj> just a question of whether I want it in the url
[04:55:05] <Cork> those comments was on what happens in the request, the client and the server behaves quite differently based on the verb though
[04:55:23] <Cork> so ex a post url can't be reloaded in the browser without a warning dialog for example
[04:55:53] <Cork> but those are just software triggering on the verb, it isn't speed related
[04:55:56] <raj> gotcha
[04:56:15] <raj> ok
[05:04:19] <jamy333> Hi. Any idea why I'm getting "undefined" with this? https://gist.github.com/jamieohanlon/223dab2494648d842509
[05:04:34] <jamy333> I'm trying to get the name of each bus stop from the array
[05:05:01] <lenswipee> Yeah I can't seem to enable submit button, see http://jsfiddle.net/za974gvh/
[05:07:42] <paranduril> jamy333, why the second $.each? departure is the stops-Array already, no?
[05:09:49] <lenswipee> still not working after updating an error, see http://jsfiddle.net/za974gvh/1/
[05:15:26] <paranduril> lenswipee: Change the second selector to $('input[name="file"]') and listen to the 'change' event.
[05:17:29] <lenswipee> paranduril: thanks!
[05:17:53] <paranduril> ^^
[05:18:02] <Cork> lenswipee: also ('#file') != "" is wrong
[05:18:09] <Cork> that won't ever not be true
[05:18:21] <Cork> cause $() always return an object
[05:18:29] <lenswipee> <lenswipee> still not working after updating an error, see http://jsfiddle.net/za974gvh/1/
[05:20:12] <Cork> lenswipee: http://jsfiddle.net/za974gvh/2/
[05:20:21] <Cork> opps error in the code
[05:20:34] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/za974gvh/3/
[05:23:45] <lenswipee> there was no error
[05:26:20] <Cork> lenswipee: 2 had an extra }
[05:26:38] <lenswipee> you are right
[05:40:16] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/15/ <-- How do i get the toggle work for all three?
[05:52:22] <lenswipee> getting 'undefined' when I alert data. is that a string or something else?
[05:54:48] <paranduril> Everything can be undefined
[05:55:19] <Whiskey> :P
[05:55:39] <lenswipee> is the undefined itself a string?
[05:57:54] <paranduril> undefined is a value of the type undefined. But JavaScript has implicit type conversion so when your code wants a string it changes undefined to "undefined" which is a string
[06:00:59] <lenswipee> i guess how to check if a radio button is checked?
[06:01:10] <lenswipee> if unchecked it gives undefined
[06:01:29] <lenswipee> i tried to check 'undefined' but that doesn't work.
[06:02:17] <Tennis> think its like active or something
[06:02:21] <Tennis> ,ive made that check before
[06:03:22] <Tennis> im looking at a form where my colleague had to verify a checkbox with jqueyr
[06:03:52] <sim642> I can't understand this: I have the most trivial jquery script including and in chrone it doesn't simply work "$ is not defined" when I try to set up the .ready event... works in firefox
[06:03:55] <Tennis> not sure if it was designed that way or is a work arround but he has 2 different checkboxes on display:none and he's checking the visibility
[06:04:23] <Tennis> erm sim642 you def pointing to the right place in your header for jquery?
[06:05:14] <sim642> Tennis, yes, I can use $ just fine from web console too
[06:05:31] <sim642> I can't understand why it doesn't work on page load
[06:05:38] <Tennis> is the main.js or whichever file below the call to jquery?
[06:06:11] <sim642> I have no main.js even, it's the simplest setup of all, jquery <script> in <head> and another <script> in <body>
[06:06:22] <sim642> I can see absolutely no reason why this wouldn't work
[06:06:24] <Tennis> hmm right
[06:06:25] <sim642> except it doesn't
[06:06:32] <Tennis> thats annoying
[06:06:51] <sim642> not just annoying, completely over the head confusing
[06:07:56] <lenswipee> tried $('input[name="radio"]').is(':checked') AND $('input[name="radio"]').val() != 'undefined' <-- either don't work
[06:09:01] <paranduril> lenswipee: use .prop('checked') -> values true/false
[06:11:13] <lenswipee> paranduril: just tried that. not working either.
[06:11:42] <lenswipee> $('input[name="radio"]').prop('checked')
[06:11:46] <paranduril> Also: for me window.alert($('#box').is(':checked')); works and gives false, not undefined
[06:11:48] <dusual> i am looking for a rtl javascript text editor preferably a light weight one
[06:11:52] <dusual> any ideas
[06:12:02] <mooncup> for editing html?
[06:12:22] <paranduril> How is your radio input defeine
[06:12:31] <paranduril> defined in HTML?
[06:12:46] <lenswipee> Paradisee: HTML IE11
[06:12:56] <lenswipee> paranduril:
[06:13:36] <paranduril> lenswipee: name attr is special for radio buttons. it forms a group so you probably have to identify the single button with an ID
[06:14:20] <dusual> mooncup, yes essentially an editor for blog
[06:14:34] <lenswipee> paranduril: OK but the prop didnt work either. ID for that too?
[06:14:52] <paranduril> yes.
[06:15:20] <mooncup> dusual: ckeditor or summernote are both good
[06:15:27] <lenswipee> you can use id twice for radio inputs?
[06:15:34] <lenswipee> two inputs
[06:15:37] <lenswipee> odd
[06:15:44] <mooncup> if you want light weight I'd go summernote
[06:15:48] <mooncup> http://summernote.org/#/
[06:16:17] <paranduril> no. damn ^^ get me a jsfiddle. Here's mine: https://jsfiddle.net/as20xsev/
[06:17:46] <paranduril> You have a radio group and want to know if _any_ of the buttons is checked?
[06:19:04] <lenswipee> paranduril: that is a checkbox not a radio button
[06:19:49] <paranduril> change it to radio it works also
[06:20:51] <paranduril> just a second
[06:30:50] <paranduril> Sorry, have to go. But remember that $('input[name="radio"]') gives you a collection of two elements, not a single element for which you can call .prop or .is
[08:33:01] <Distraught> guys http://pastebin.com/ypvRcZpe
[08:33:11] <Distraught> please give me a hand. I still cannot do it.
[08:33:26] <Distraught> I get a 404 on submit form to the action and the file exist
[08:33:27] <Distraught> s
[08:36:00] <taplar> this line isn't right: jQuery.post(postURL, serializedSettings).done.whenItsDone;
[08:36:08] <taplar> jQuery.post(postURL, serializedSettings).done(whenItsDone);
[08:37:17] <Distraught> taplar yes  was trying things. Still got the 404
[08:37:30] <Distraught> keep in mind i m a noob
[08:37:39] <taplar> and as far as the url getting a 404, you console logged the url it is trying to go to and putting it in your browser your able to go there?
[08:37:40] <Distraught> so trying wrong things is kinda of logical
[08:37:51] <Distraught> taplar yes the url is there
[08:37:56] <Distraught> the file*
[08:38:09] <taplar> but you can go to it normally with the browser?
[08:38:13] <Distraught> i think it has to do with seriallie
[08:38:19] <skione> hi, I have a table, when you click in a cell it replaces the content with a select, however the click event still registers so I get into a race condition. I tried removing the class but that isn't working. How do I prevent the click action from firing?
[08:38:21] <Distraught> taplar yes i can go with browser
[08:38:57] <taplar> skione: how are you doing your binding?
[08:39:32] <skione> http://pastebin.com/AJi0U7k0 taplar this is what I have so far
[08:40:33] <skione> once I get this figured out, the code that is commented out will move up into the success block of the ajax function
[08:41:11] <taplar> k, it's still firing because the event is bound to the td
[08:41:58] <taplar> try changing: $(".priority").on('click',function(){
[08:42:30] <taplar> ah, hold on
[08:42:50] <taplar> yeah
[08:43:06] <taplar> to: $(".priority").closest('tr').on('click', '.priority', function(){
[08:43:07] <skione> yea I just did that
[08:43:11] <skione> oh
[08:43:15] <skione> ok
[08:43:21] <taplar> that should cause the removing of the class to stop the firing
[08:44:01] <taplar> well, not stop the firing, but the handling of the click will not happen anymore as it won't match the criteria
[08:48:45] <Distraught> taplar do you have any idea whats happening/
[08:48:47] <Distraught> ?
[08:49:18] <taplar> not really.  if you can hit it normally but not with the post, then that would seem like something in the post is returning a 404
[08:49:35] <taplar> or the endpoint only accepts get requests
[08:49:57] <notchris> I'm trying to make a request to a website that I have CORS access to
[08:50:06] <Distraught> the endpoint is asking some vars from the form
[08:50:13] <notchris> I can send a request, but  it works only when actually visiting the other site once
[08:50:17] <Distraught> $adadas = $_POST[adssad];
[08:50:20] <notchris> I assume because it sets a session?
[08:50:25] <notchris> how can I work around this?
[08:56:27] <paranduril> is lenswipee still around?
[09:08:56] <Distraught> well it worked
[09:09:01] <Distraught> with a little problem at the end
[09:09:04] <Distraught> hmm
[09:15:14] <dumptruckman> hello
[09:15:43] <dumptruckman> i'm looking to add the ability to taphold a list item in order to drag and reposition it
[09:16:13] <dumptruckman> i'm assuming the taphold event would be my starting place
[09:17:16] <dumptruckman> but i'm not sure where to go from there
[09:30:40] <midori-rus> hello. Is it possible to send to an Object a real element? I am trying to reffactor some function and wanted to white object oriented class
[09:31:15] <taplar> what do you mean send an object an element?
[09:32:28] <Kartagis> a google translate gone bad :D
[09:33:15] <midori-rus> Kartagis: I don't use it
[09:33:37] <taplar> midori-rus: can you elaborate?  i'm not sure yet exactly what your trying to do
[09:33:45] <midori-rus> taplar: let's I try to explain what I wanna make. I have got this code http://jsfiddle.net/d5a8eong/
[09:34:50] <taplar> fwiw you most likely don't what isNaN.  you probably wand !$.isNumeric()
[09:34:58] <taplar> wand=want
[09:35:03] <midori-rus> taplar: but I don't like it. It is so hard to add some new features to this code. I want to make some class which will be called like IncrementPrice with some methods and properties
[09:36:02] <taplar> oh, well you can always just make some functions that take in the arguments and manipulates on them
[09:36:46] <taplar> let me take a closer look at this
[09:45:55] <taplar> this version has the plus and minus logic separated so it is a bit more clear and modular: http://jsfiddle.net/d5a8eong/1/
[09:46:03] <taplar> i only re-implemented the minus logic you had
[09:49:24] <Distraught> guys .done shouldn't wait for the script to finsh?
[09:49:35] <taplar> it should wait for the promise to finish
[09:49:45] <Distraught> jQuery.post(postURL, serializedSettings).done(whenItsDone());
[09:49:47] <Distraught> oh.
[09:49:58] <taplar> your invoking the method
[09:50:00] <Distraught> So i need to get a response when the script of posturl finishes
[09:50:10] <Distraught> how can i do that?
[09:50:20] <taplar> no, you are.  whenItsDone()
[09:50:26] <taplar> just give it the function name
[09:50:48] <Distraught> whenItsDone is not a function
[09:50:57] <Distraught> i tried before
[09:51:04] <Distraught> my function is defined though
[09:51:08] <taplar> your doing () at the end of it, so if it's not a function that's entirely wrong
[09:51:20] <Distraught> var whenItsDone = function() { blah blah }
[09:51:27] <taplar> that's a function
[09:51:36] <Distraught> y i have it right above
[09:51:48] <Distraught> and i get it's not a function
[09:51:48] <Cork> Distraught: whenItsDone() executes the function wheItsDone references it
[09:52:03] <Cork> Distraught: the later is what you want if you want to forward the function to a third party for execution
[09:52:30] <Cork> Distraught: also make a jsfiddle with the context of the calls
[09:52:33] <Distraught> yeap whenitsdone http://pastebin.com/71Zp15f2
[09:52:36] <Distraught> oh
[09:52:42] <Distraught> forget else statement
[09:52:48] <Distraught> its form a prvious statement
[09:52:54] <Cork> jQuery.post(postURL, serializedSettings).whenItsDone(); <--
[09:52:59] <Cork> that isn't correct
[09:53:01] <taplar> .done(whenItsDone)
[09:53:25] <Distraught> i did taplar .done(whenItsDone)
[09:53:36] <Distraught> and i get a 404 after the script is finished for no reason
[09:53:37] <Cork> not in the pastebin you just linked...
[09:53:51] <Distraught> y it was on the previous one though
[09:53:55] <Distraught> i m trying since yesterday
[09:53:56] <taplar> then you have another issue, not the structure of your deferred callback handling
[09:54:18] <Distraught> 	jQuery.post(postURL, serializedSettings).done(whenItsDone());	
[09:54:23] <Cork> ...
[09:54:37] <Cork> no that is executing the whenItsDone not referencing it
[09:54:45] <Cork> see my comment a few lines up
[09:55:03] <Distraught> y without ()
[09:55:14] <Distraught> it returns a 404 . But the script runs correctly
[09:55:19] <taplar> because you are giving done a function to call when the deferred is resolved
[09:55:38] <taplar> by doing () it is calling the function immediately, not giving the function reference
[09:55:47] <Cork> Distraught: could you make a new pastebin (or preferably a jsfiddle) with the full context of this code?
[09:56:14] <Distraught> Cork the script that i put the vars is php so i can just put the javascript. Will that help?
[09:56:25] <Cork> ya
[09:56:34] <Cork> Distraught: also jQuery('#linkde').attr('value',''); <-- this is definitely wrong
[09:57:06] <Cork> either your setting value on a none form element (and that should be data-value instead) or you should use prop('value') or even better .val()
[09:58:08] <Distraught> https://jsfiddle.net/grtka5ts/
[09:58:11] <Distraught> does this help?
[09:58:22] <Cork> yes it does
[09:59:09] <Cork> and that code vies you errors?
[09:59:18] <Distraught> no errors in php or logs
[09:59:27] <Cork> i mean it gives you js errors?
[10:00:01] <Cork> cause except the attr('value', '') part it looks fine
[10:00:02] <Distraught> yes when the script finishes it shows a 404 error
[10:00:33] <Cork> uh
[10:00:34] <Distraught> in the link that it posted the form values
[10:00:42] <Cork> Distraught: what script finishes with 404?
[10:01:09] <Cork> done doesn't trigger the form again
[10:01:21] <Cork> whenItsDone i mean
[10:01:29] <Distraught> y i know
[10:01:31] <Distraught> it's weird
[10:01:39] <Distraught> it should not show that
[10:01:42] <Cork> i suspect it is the .post that results in 404
[10:01:50] <Cork> (line 23)
[10:01:51] <Distraught> or serialize
[10:01:54] <Cork> no
[10:02:00] <Distraught> but it gets the parameters correctly
[10:02:02] <Cork> serialize doesn't do network calls
[10:02:15] <Cork> it just looks in the dom
[10:02:43] <Cork> 404 means the server can't find '<current location>/linkofphpfile.php'
[10:03:08] <Cork> might it be you meant to have / at the beginning of postURL?
[10:03:16] <Brago> Q: Does jqueryui.sortable() work on mobile devices (iphone/android/windowsphone)?
[10:03:24] <Distraught> w8 to change the link
[10:03:48] <Distraught> same :S
[10:03:51] <Cork> Brago: you need to add a plugin to get jquery ui to support touch events
[10:03:55] <Cork> except for that, ya
[10:04:19] <Cork> Distraught: and if you check the browsers network tab it actually tries to access the correct url?
[10:05:01] <Distraught> yes
[10:05:07] <Distraught> Cork
[10:05:20] <Cork> and the server returns 404?
[10:05:44] <Distraught> Status Code:404 Not Found
[10:07:02] <Cork> so check why the server doesn't find the resource then
[10:07:12] <Cork> you can't fix this client side if the url is correct
[10:13:04] <dumptruckman> bleh
[10:13:30] <dumptruckman> i brought in jQuery UI and it screwed up my Select Menu

[10:28:26] <MacroMan> $.getJSON is requesting a http insecure address even though I've specifically given it an https address. What could be causing this?
[10:31:00] <MacroMan> http://pastie.org/10466218
[10:33:00] <MacroMan> Ah ignore me. My website is redirecting the https to the http version.
[10:34:42] <zumba_addict> folks, my "$(window).resize(_.bind(function() {" is growing. Everytime I got back to the page that his this code, it adds a new event. What's happening now is that the code is getting execute twice or more depending on how often i go back to this page
[10:34:55] <zumba_addict> his/has
[10:35:31] <zumba_addict> is there like an if (resize event already exists) { kill it then make a new one }
[10:36:16] <shoky_> there is, but it'd be better to fix the underlying issue rather than work around it like that...
[10:36:33] <shoky_> what do you mean by "go back to this page"
[10:36:49] <shoky_> if you weren't on the page, how could it be adding more event handlers
[10:37:26] <zumba_addict> when I enter the page, I execute the $(window).rezize
[10:38:25] <zumba_addict> then I go to another page like clicking another item then I click back button, it goes to our initialize method again which has the $(window).rezize
[10:38:41] <shoky_> but when you leave a page, any event handlers it had are gone
[10:38:50] <shoky_> so when you go back.. you're back to none
[10:39:08] <zumba_addict> same app, not different website
[10:39:56] <shoky_> that doesn't mean much to me
[10:40:04] <zumba_addict> ok, i'll continue troubelshooting

[11:03:48] <notchris> How do I get the request cookies from an external site?
[11:03:52] <notchris> Given that CORS is enabled?
[11:36:37] <krz> no $.put or $.delete ?
[11:36:47] <krz> there is $.post though. just want to make sure
[11:36:57] <duch_kazatel> check the api docs :)
[11:36:59] <krz> do we need to use $.ajax for put and delete?
[11:37:18] <duch_kazatel> i'd use $.ajax for everyting, event get and post.

[11:39:30] <claytonzaugg> I need to disable scrolling for a certain <section> but am not sure how to do so.
[11:39:50] <duch_kazatel> css - scrolling: none; iirc
[11:40:01] <claytonzaugg> Cool, thank you
[11:47:05] <claytonzaugg> duch_kazatel, that syntax doesn't exist, but thanks though.  Ultimately I'm trying to keep the ability to swipe something down on a tablet, but not "scroll" up when I swipe that icon down
[11:47:26] <duch_kazatel> err, overflow was what i was thinking.
[11:47:54] <duch_kazatel> my bad.
[11:48:01] <claytonzaugg> it's all good, let me give that a shot then
[11:48:25] <duch_kazatel> that might not work for you though - your explanation seems a little awkward.
[11:50:46] <andricDu> anyone here knowledgeable about the qtip plugin?
[11:51:08] <duch_kazatel> andricDu i'd just ask your question - if anybody can help, they will.
[11:52:31] <andricDu> Anyone know if you can specify where the generated <div> for a qtip gets appended to?
[11:52:41] <claytonzaugg> duch_kazatel, I'm working on an emulated touch panel our company makes.  In that panel, there are parts that you swipe an icon down to activate something.  However, on a mobile device, when you swipe down anywhere, it cause the screen to go up, like normal, but I don[t want that.
[11:53:21] <duch_kazatel> claytonzaugg i might check out a touch library and go from there - should be doable.
[11:53:44] <duch_kazatel> andricDu qtip 1 or 2?
[11:53:51] <andricDu> 1
[11:53:55] <claytonzaugg> Okay thanks.  Any advice on what syntax my google search should be? "Touch library disable swipe" ?
[11:54:50] <duch_kazatel> javascript touch library or jquery touch plugin
[11:54:53] <duch_kazatel> variations on that theme.
[11:55:01] <claytonzaugg> Cool, thank you
[11:55:12] <duch_kazatel> or just jquery disable touch swipe -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16180498/disabling-swipe-on-a-specific-div
[11:55:57] <claytonzaugg> Rad, thank you!
[11:56:34] <duch_kazatel> andricDu doesn't look like it - why are you trying to change that part?
[11:56:51] <andricDu> looking for a way for qtips not showing up in fullscreen mode
[11:57:07] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[11:57:37] <andricDu> looking for a way to fix qtips not showing up in fullscreen *
[11:57:40] <Enissay> Hey guys, in a chrome console, i'm using something like $("span.className") which returns a list of all matched nodes (html code), Is there an easy way to get the same list with tags stripped without passing by a loop ?
[11:58:05] <duch_kazatel> andricDu right, i got that much - are you trying to fix a bug?
[11:58:18] <duch_kazatel> Enissay "with tags stripped"?
[11:58:35] <duch_kazatel> Enissay what do you want the data to look like?
[11:58:45] <andricDu> well yea
[11:59:06] <andricDu> qtips work fine on my page
[11:59:15] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:02:02] <Enissay> Oh, he left :<

[12:12:53] <skione> taplar: sorry for the delay but your fix work, thanks much!
[12:13:06] <taplar> cool
[12:13:46] <taplar> Enissay: if you want the text for each of those that would be a use case for map
[12:14:57] <Enissay> taplar, I indeed just found this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16300149/1519058

[12:16:04] <`ULT> hi, what is the best way to format strings like this: â¬ 2.328,00 to 2328.00
[12:16:08] <`ULT> with format and regular expression ?
[12:16:18] <`ULT> or is there something more easy?
[12:16:53] <taplar> 'â¬ 2.328,00' ?
[12:17:43] <`ULT> yeah, a price string to number
[12:22:11] <taplar> might be an easier way but: https://jsfiddle.net/fLwmxoyb/

[12:44:36] <LindsayMac> taplar sorry about last night. My internet cut out
[12:45:07] <taplar> np
[12:45:58] <taplar> you only crushed my spirt, i'm fine
[12:46:13] <taplar> *sniffle* ....i'm FINE!
[12:47:15] <LindsayMac> taplar:  lol.. im sorry! Jeeze.. what do you want? My first born?! lol
[12:47:47] <taplar> ^_^
[12:55:21] <Whiskey> How do i get this working, http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/23/ i try to remove the "toggleable Dos" from ViewLink but i canÂ´t get it working
[12:56:42] <taplar> what's the intended functionality?
[12:57:02] <Whiskey> What do you mean?
[12:57:09] <Whiskey> just have TExt and Image view, and remove the Dos view
[12:57:20] <Whiskey> <span class="toggleable Dos" data-toggle-next=".Image">Image</span> <-- that one
[12:57:51] <dumptruckman> is there a way to detect if an element is overflowing?
[12:57:55] <LindsayMac> Whiskey:  you have a syntax error
[12:58:20] <taplar> ^ that is true
[12:58:25] <dumptruckman> i want to resize an element when another element gains a veritcal scrollbar
[12:58:44] <taplar> but also your adding that span after you do your binding so it's not going to have the handlers on it, the way your doing it
[12:58:57] <Whiskey> yeh buts that wonÂ´t fix the problem
[12:59:36] <LindsayMac> Whiskey:  still...
[12:59:41] <dumptruckman> also, how can i make a button unfocusable?
[12:59:53] <dumptruckman> like, i want it to be clickable but not to take focus from the current item
[12:59:58] <Whiskey> Well im not sure how to get around it
[13:01:16] <LindsayMac> Whiskey:  you're escaping SOME "" but not all
[13:01:45] <Whiskey> LindsayMac: for second time i know but thats not the problem
[13:02:09] <LindsayMac> Whiskey:  to test and debug code you probably SHOULD start without any errors.. doncha think?
[13:02:30] <taplar> always find parse errors first
[13:02:32] <taplar> fix
[13:02:50] <Whiskey> Lindrian: yeh thats true
[13:04:13] <LindsayMac> Whiskey:  its kind of hard to follow what you're actually trying to do
[13:04:53] <Whiskey> Sloved :)
[13:05:03] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/26/ <-- there you have
[13:05:05] <LindsayMac> you mean fixing the error solved it..
[13:05:10] <Whiskey> No
[13:05:24] <duch_kazatel> so what's the issue here?
[13:05:28] <LindsayMac> Whiskey:  fixing the error helped you solve it
[13:05:45] <LindsayMac> hey duch_kazatel .. sorry about bailing last night. Internet cut out
[13:05:50] <duch_kazatel> not a big deal.
[13:06:09] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i know.. but its a pet peeve of mine when people do that when i'm trying to help.. so just .. sorry
[13:06:26] <duch_kazatel> nah, don't be.  it happens.
[13:06:45] <duch_kazatel> $("[data-toggle-next]") :(
[13:06:54] <duch_kazatel> .attr("data-toggle-next", ".Image")
[13:06:55] <duch_kazatel> welp
[13:07:06] <taplar> lol
[13:07:22] <LindsayMac> If either of you are interested in helping again... http://pastebin.com/z7ZjnW67
[13:07:23] <duch_kazatel> hey Whiskey that's not what data attributes are for.
[13:07:33] <Whiskey> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/27/ try click on text on that one and you see its still broken
[13:07:42] <LindsayMac> this is my code. i'm having a hard time figuring out how to get the value of each record's firstname value
[13:07:58] <taplar> i thought i answered that last night
[13:07:59] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: you have any batte slotion to do it you are welcome
[13:08:14] <taplar> or someone asked something like that for an array of objects
[13:08:17] <duch_kazatel> hey Whiskey so when you add that span the event binding doesn't magically update.
[13:08:27] <LindsayMac> taplar:  I lost connection
[13:08:45] <LindsayMac> taplar:  that was me.. appologizing for not getting to respond to your sggestion
[13:08:49] <taplar> $.map( basicArrayVariable, function(){ return this.firstname; }).get();
[13:09:03] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: thats why i did the last one whit attrt
[13:09:04] <duch_kazatel> no need to use $.map() fwiw.
[13:09:08] <Whiskey> Seems to work atlest
[13:09:20] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey data attributes aren't meant for selecting.
[13:09:22] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i wasn't origibnally using .map() and was having issues
[13:09:23] <duch_kazatel> you should use classes.
[13:09:54] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: response.firstname returns undefined
[13:09:57] <Whiskey> well i do, but i donÂ´t see how else i can do it
[13:10:07] <LindsayMac> Whiskey:  classes or IDs?
[13:10:14] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac i have no idea what that means w/r/t your code.
[13:10:25] <LindsayMac> w/r/t ?
[13:10:36] <taplar> he has an array of objects from json, if i remember correctly
[13:10:50] <duch_kazatel> with regards to.

[13:11:12] <LindsayMac> are you not getting my links? I pasted pastebins twice now
[13:11:13] <Whiskey> but somehow it need to know whats to toggle next

[13:11:38] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey and you're presenting it as your code ;)
[13:11:40] <notchris> Why would an ajax request not always get all of the cookies?
[13:11:42] <duch_kazatel> own it and fix it.
[13:11:57] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac i must have missed the first one, but why not make a fiddle with actual data?
[13:12:00] <LindsayMac> oh hay notchris ;)
[13:12:15] <notchris> Hey LindsayMac :D
[13:12:21] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  sure thing.. didn't think it was necessary but I can do that ..
[13:12:36] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac you want to map data coming from an endpoint, right?
[13:12:36] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i google on it this morrning but i never get how it works
[13:12:48] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey how what works?
[13:13:18] <`ULT> hi taplar, was gone for a moment. but thanks.
[13:13:22] <Whiskey> toggles
[13:13:23] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: yea basically. It's strange because I am able to use this same (basic) code with autocomplete with the same formatted results but with .ajax() i can not seem to actually get the records returned
[13:13:36] <Whiskey> but i got an idee
[13:13:44] <taplar> `ULT: cool
[13:13:52] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac i'm sorry, i'm not following - what's the issue you're trying to solve again?
[13:14:04] <Whiskey> if i have class="1 2 3" how do you select the second one?
[13:14:15] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey that's a terrible idea.
[13:14:18] <Whiskey> well i can use id it wonÂ´t matter
[13:14:21] <duch_kazatel> class order is not guaranteed.
[13:14:34] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: hold on.. i'm making a fiddle... it should clarify
[13:14:45] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey use data attributes to store data.  use classes to select things.
[13:15:43] <Whiskey> and again i donÂ´t know how
[13:15:50] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey how to do what?
[13:16:03] <Whiskey> ffs use class to select
[13:16:08] <duch_kazatel> $('.someClass')
[13:16:11] <duch_kazatel> done.
[13:16:43] <Whiskey> yeh but still has to
[13:16:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:17:37] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: the active still needs to be there right?
[13:18:36] <duch_kazatel> sure, that has nothing to do with why using data attributes in $() is a bad idea.
[13:19:33] <duch_kazatel> it looks like you're just trying to move elements around on click.
[13:19:52] <taplar> looks like he could use next() and conditionally back to the first one
[13:20:38] <duch_kazatel> not even that: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xzLxas2s/28/
[13:20:47] <duch_kazatel> if literally all you want is a toggle, just do that.
[13:22:05] <Whiskey> dut: still donÂ´t know how, thinked something like $(this).text()
[13:22:13] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey wat
[13:22:18] <duch_kazatel> look at my last fiddle duder.
[13:22:18] <Whiskey> like jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/29/
[13:22:20] <duch_kazatel> there's your toggle.
[13:22:42] <duch_kazatel> i never said "don't use data attributes"
[13:22:59] <duch_kazatel> i said "don't use data attributes to select". as in, don't do $('[data-some-thing]');
[13:23:25] <Whiskey> :/
[13:23:32] <duch_kazatel> i said that a few times now.
[13:23:39] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:23:48] <Whiskey> Still think thats my should work
[13:23:56] <duch_kazatel> obviously it doesn't.
[13:23:58] <Whiskey> as the nest always is in the .text()
[13:24:07] <Whiskey> "next", do you see how i thinkeD?
[13:24:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:24:53] <Whiskey> yeh whit my fiddle
[13:25:04] <duch_kazatel> your fiddle doesn't work - are you trying to understand why?
[13:25:20] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  do you mind if I PM you a link? it has a query url to it i'd rather not share publicly
[13:25:43] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac if you don't want the public to see it, i don't want to see it :)
[13:25:48] <Whiskey> aaa :D
[13:25:55] <taplar> 'query url' ?
[13:26:06] <LindsayMac> I can't seem to get local json array to work with jsfiddle
[13:26:08] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac is your issue with ajax or with parsing data?
[13:26:22] <duch_kazatel> share what you had with the local array and i'll see if i can't fix from there.
[13:26:33] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/30/ <-- there you go
[13:26:46] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  parsing response data... but if I do something like var myData = [ { ..... formatted data ....} ]; it wont work in the fiddle
[13:26:51] <LindsayMac> ok
[13:27:00] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey don't do that, either.
[13:27:23] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/ufaoqaak/4/
[13:27:44] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey now you're relying on the text of an element to handle this.  why not just use my solution"?
[13:27:47] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: the idea is you type a value into the input, click CONTINUE and it will return a JSON response
[13:27:48] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: why?
[13:27:59] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i donÂ´t see why you donÂ´t like my one
[13:28:05] <Whiskey> I just try to be smart
[13:28:07] <LindsayMac> oops. forgot the containing div duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/ufaoqaak/5/
[13:28:09] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey that's not smart.
[13:28:20] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey relying on text in the document is never "Smart" - that's "hacky"
[13:28:34] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: ok sorry for traying then
[13:28:42] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to apologize for trying.
[13:28:50] <duch_kazatel> but i gave you a solution and you ignored it - why?
[13:28:53] <taplar> i don't think 'source' is a valid property for $.ajax
[13:28:59] <taplar> i don't see it in the docs
[13:29:38] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: not really i just like to try self, first i think it is to proof my self that i actully can get something working, And atlest proof in this case for you that im not lazy and just try to get well "everything on a silverplate"
[13:29:46] <LindsayMac> taplar:  oh hmmm... i use url for when i have an actual URL but i thought source when you have a local array
[13:29:57] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac that's not how that works :)
[13:30:04] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: Is that answer good enoth for you?
[13:30:13] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey no need to cop an attitude homie :)

[13:30:37] <Whiskey> "like some"
[13:30:54] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey we're not saying you're lazy.  you're just directing your efforts to some really strange places.
[13:31:04] <Whiskey> :P
[13:31:06] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac so where in this fiddle are you striggling?
[13:31:21] <duch_kazatel> *struggling
[13:31:32] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  well inthe fiddle I can't get it to work the way it is when I use a url to get the JSON instead of a local array....
[13:31:42] <duch_kazatel> that's fine - what's the problem you're having?
[13:31:50] <duch_kazatel> it's okay if the fiddle doesn't function in this case.
[13:32:01] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  but the REAL issue when I use a local array is that I can't seem to figure out how to get the value of 'firstname' in the response that is formatted the same way the array is formatted in the fiddle
[13:32:04] <LindsayMac> does that make sense
[13:32:55] <duch_kazatel> var $title = jQuery('<h1>').text(response.firstname); this is part of your problem.
[13:32:57] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: $(this).next().after($(this)); does that do anything?
[13:33:07] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey try removing it and see ;)
[13:33:14] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yea.. response.firstname is the problem basically
[13:33:33] <Whiskey> yeh it does
[13:33:35] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: i have no idea how to get the value of firstname if the response looks like the array
[13:33:44] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac there are three first names.
[13:33:45] <Whiskey> it makes sure it donÂ´t be mixed up
[13:34:02] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yea I want to return a firstname for all the records in the response
[13:34:32] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  it's basically a searching ajax. I pass the value of the input and my php returns a JSON string with all matching records. I need to list all of those matching records in my div
[13:34:37] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[13:35:00] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: it donÂ´t do anything?
[13:35:05] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey ...
[13:35:13] <Whiskey> results are the same
[13:35:23] <duch_kazatel> then fine.
[13:35:25] <duch_kazatel> yeesh
[13:35:40] <duch_kazatel> i was guessing what your issue was and trying to fix it.
[13:35:40] <Whiskey> :P
[13:36:42] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ufaoqaak/6/
[13:36:42] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: you broke some other things :D
[13:36:52] <duch_kazatel> like what?
[13:37:12] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i love you
[13:37:20] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac get the gist?
[13:37:30] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yup.. pretty sure I should be able to do something with this
[13:37:47] <duch_kazatel> .map() returns a new array of values.  basically, you're mapping one format to another.
[13:38:07] <taplar> oh, so Array has it's own map
[13:38:12] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[13:38:17] <taplar> dkt
[13:38:25] <duch_kazatel> $.map() is a fill for Array.prototype.map
[13:38:31] <duch_kazatel> $.fn.map() is for jquery elements.
[13:38:50] <taplar> is Array.prototype.map an ecma 5.1?
[13:39:02] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  in my example, since response holds the actual data (when I use the URL method) nonUsers.map would actually be response.map right?
[13:39:06] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map basically.
[13:39:16] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/31/ <-- why canÂ´t i select the last JS what to start on?
[13:39:16] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac if it's the array, yes.
[13:39:24] <LindsayMac> ok perfect. thanks
[13:39:30] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey try again.
[13:40:06] <Whiskey> wtf lurn reading ffs :D
[13:40:11] <Whiskey> sorry duch_kazatel :) my fult :D
[13:40:31] <LindsayMac> Whiskey: you're not winning over any friends here
[13:40:34] <Whiskey> have my head to high on the screen :D
[13:40:52] <Whiskey> LindsayMac: that was for me not him :) But okay
[13:41:11] <Whiskey> Hioe i made that clear in my line after that one
[13:41:17] <Whiskey> "hope"
[13:41:54] <notchris> Such english, much grammar
[13:41:59] <LindsayMac> notchris:   lol
[13:42:13] <taplar> not everyone's native
[13:42:22] <notchris> Native to Earth yo
[13:42:30] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: then it end up whit this, http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/32/ <-- is there anything you think are wrong in that code or is that fine?
[13:42:33] <notchris> *queue twilight zone
[13:42:42] <duch_kazatel> $(".ViewLink .Text").attr("data-toggle-next", ".Image")
[13:42:51] <duch_kazatel> use .data(), not .attr(), for data attributes.
[13:43:19] <Whiskey> thats actully not work
[13:43:24] <duch_kazatel> yes, it does.
[13:43:40] <duch_kazatel> that functions identically to what you currently have,.
[13:43:44] <Whiskey> okay, i forgot remove the data before :)
[13:43:48] <Whiskey> thats everything?
[13:44:02] <duch_kazatel> i really don't understand what you're trying to accomplish with this.
[13:44:07] <duch_kazatel> you're never shower your "Dos"
[13:44:10] <duch_kazatel> *showing
[13:44:17] <Whiskey> i do, but not thin this code
[13:44:18] <duch_kazatel> so it's hard for me to make a complete assessment.
[13:44:38] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: it shows like 5min then i remove it and just show text and image
[13:44:53] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:44:59] <Whiskey> yes a timer you know
[13:45:02] <Whiskey> countdown
[13:45:25] <duch_kazatel> lol whatever duder.  still not making sense.
[13:45:57] <taplar> *guitar* it's the final countdown!
[13:46:06] <Whiskey> What part do you donÂ´t understand i running everything espect the two last lines for 5min
[13:46:15] <taplar> gah, gotta hit up youtube now
[13:46:20] <Whiskey> after that its go in and run the 2 last lines
[13:46:39] <Whiskey> taplar: you mean the europe song?
[13:46:51] <taplar> :D
[13:46:56] <Whiskey> you from sweden?
[13:47:13] <mouse> but you're wearing...leiderhosen
[13:47:16] <taplar> that was a pretty big song
[13:47:46] <Whiskey> that donÂ´t answer the question :D
[13:48:01] <taplar> i'm aware, :)
[13:48:11] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey what does that question have to do with anything?
[13:48:42] <Whiskey> well im from sweden and was actully on this band for liike 4 weeks ago :)
[13:48:57] <jim_j> hi all
[13:49:06] <taplar> hey jimmy john
[13:49:13] <jim_j> hey taplar
[13:49:45] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i continue the talk about the band europe :)
[13:49:49] <jim_j> I have a modal script that needs to add a script tag dynamically to the modal, what's the best way to do this?
[13:50:11] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: as you have anythig to say of everything see if i have it still 1s
[13:50:28] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i'm not understanding anything you're saying at this point.  sorry!
[13:50:32] <duch_kazatel> jim_j why do you need to append the script tag to the modal?
[13:51:06] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, because there's audio in the script tag and I can't pre-load it or it will play in the background
[13:51:17] <jim_j> duch, this is my example code:  http://jsfiddle.net/wahkLzj2/9/
[13:52:45] <taplar> jim_j: an alternative would be to include the logic of the script already on the page in a function, and when the modal is displayed, or whever, execute the funtion
[13:53:22] <claytonzaugg> duch_kazatel, if you remember my question about prevening scrolling when swiping, I found the solution. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14219992/prevent-touchmove-event-conflict-with-scroll-of-jquery-ui-dialog
[13:53:28] <jim_j> taplar, nice.  there's a check for is modal active?
[13:53:38] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/33/
[13:53:42] <alasdairm> hi, i am trying to report a bug at http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report and every time I try to submit I get "Submission rejected as potential spam (Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP (127.0.0.1) exceeded)"
[13:53:44] <Whiskey> What you think about that :)
[13:53:51] <Whiskey> Its a working code
[13:53:52] <claytonzaugg> ItThe solution of mine wasn't in the answer, but the question.  I used the 2nd bit of code and it worked.  Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.
[13:53:57] <Whiskey> Was just after some feedback
[13:54:05] <alasdairm> any ideas? I am not a spammer
[13:54:19] <duch_kazatel> alasdairm ask in #jquery-dev
[13:54:23] <jim_j> taplar, something like $("#mydialog").dialog( "isOpen" ) ?
[13:54:35] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey this has some cruft in it.
[13:54:37] <alasdairm> @duch_kazatel, thanks
[13:54:38] <taplar> jim_j: i'm assuming you have some sort of logic that happens to open the modal no?
[13:55:09] <jim_j> taplar, yes, a click event triggers it
[13:55:12] <duch_kazatel> missing semicolons, variable redelcarations, lots of potential coercion, missing vars, etc.
[13:55:24] <duch_kazatel> stuff like var id = $(this).attr("id").slice(0,-1) is a bad idea.
[13:55:27] <taplar> so there ya go.  when they click it and you open the modal, fun the function
[13:55:29] <duch_kazatel> so is $(".PreView").css({"max-width": window.screen.availWidth - 100 + "px"})
[13:55:32] <taplar> fun=run
[13:55:41] <jim_j> taplar, cool, will try that thanks!
[13:57:13] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: the simicolons are not needed, i never understand that
[13:57:23] <Whiskey> sometimes is needed sometimes not
[13:59:10] <duch_kazatel> they're needed after all statements.
[13:59:20] <duch_kazatel> it's technically an error to omit them in those cases.
[13:59:50] <duch_kazatel> otherwise the JS engine uses ASI to try to help you.  so you're basically leaving it up to a complex algorithm to try to figure out where semicolons belong.
[14:01:07] <Whiskey> lol
[14:01:14] <Whiskey> so whit other words it donÂ´t matter
[14:01:19] <duch_kazatel> it DOES matter.
[14:01:24] <Whiskey> But, it will take uneeded resorses for nothing?
[14:01:28] <duch_kazatel> just because your code "runs" does not make it valid.
[14:01:43] <Whiskey> Have i understand it right?
[14:01:44] <taplar> unneeded resources?
[14:01:49] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey no.
[14:01:55] <duch_kazatel> it's shitty code.
[14:01:57] <duch_kazatel> that's what i mean.
[14:02:05] <taplar> a character is one byte
[14:02:13] <duch_kazatel> it's a bad idea to omit semicolons and let the engine try to figure out what you meant.
[14:02:17] <Whiskey> yeh, it has to work to get it right for nothing, when it culd be correct on from the start
[14:02:35] <Whiskey> Yeh it was exactily what i wrote, extra power for nothing
[14:02:40] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:02:43] <duch_kazatel> that's not the concern.
[14:02:50] <duch_kazatel> never code for speed - always code for readability.
[14:03:00] <duch_kazatel> semicolons greatly help most people understand your code.
[14:03:08] <duch_kazatel> it removes abiguity about what you intended.
[14:04:18] <Whiskey> man i have someone to explain for me n swedish about this cuz i donÂ´t get it
[14:04:42] <Whiskey> I get what you say, but not how it make it more easy to read
[14:04:45] <duch_kazatel> using semicolons means cleaner code.
[14:04:53] <duch_kazatel> most programmers expect them.
[14:08:04] <Whiskey> :)
[14:08:20] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: the toggle works perfect anyways and thanks
[14:19:10] <Whiskey> Who pulled the plug?
[14:19:16] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: you still here?
[14:19:31] <duch_kazatel> along with over 690 other people, sure.
[14:21:01] <`ULT> :p
[14:25:30] <Whiskey> hehe
[14:25:42] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i try to fiux that fiddle see if i can get it right
[14:26:10] <duch_kazatel> col.
[14:26:12] <duch_kazatel> *cool
[14:28:37] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i have think about clean it up just for, but mutch of the code is "bad" coded but still works, i mean i wonÂ´t fool anyone :D im just happy if it works and wonÂ´t break
[14:28:53] <duch_kazatel> bad code can easily break when you want to add/change things.
[14:29:01] <duch_kazatel> that's part of why we strive for good code.
[14:30:19] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/34/ thats what you looking for?
[14:30:48] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i would say it donÂ´t matter aslong the site not is to big
[14:30:49] <duch_kazatel> better with the semicolons.
[14:30:59] <duch_kazatel> var eq = $(this).attr("id").slice(-2, -1); this is pretty strange.
[14:31:05] <Whiskey> but i still just run it private and i feel as long as i know what it is
[14:31:16] <Whiskey> yeh you see you have
[14:31:27] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey splitting ids is not a good idea.
[14:31:32] <bondibox> having a bit of a challenge getting a simple jquery request to work on a RoR app. Not even an error... http://pastie.org/private/d4q6ycehoqlsyleainzdg thanks for looking
[14:31:40] <Whiskey> <div id="fileinfoblock0" class="dataViewBox-BottomBorder"> <--- and its running a loop so it will be 0 1 2 3 4 5
[14:32:13] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: id is always the same but i think i get your point
[14:32:16] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i'd use a data attribute and then filter against those elements.
[14:32:55] <duch_kazatel> also, == is bad.
[14:32:56] <duch_kazatel> use ===
[14:33:05] <Whiskey> but i still donÂ´t see the problem whit the ; espect else you use them or not and not like i did before do it on some places and some not
[14:33:15] <Whiskey> why the hell is == bad
[14:33:21] <duch_kazatel> == coerces.
[14:33:24] <duch_kazatel> === does not.
[14:33:34] <Whiskey> donÂ´t know what that mean
[14:33:44] <duch_kazatel> 0 == '0' is true.
[14:33:47] <duch_kazatel> 0 === '0' is false.
[14:33:53] <taplar> bondibox: i don't believe data type 'script' is valid
[14:34:01] <Whiskey> but == is equal, and === is equal + same type right
[14:34:01] <duch_kazatel> string zero and the number zero aren't the same thing.
[14:34:07] <Whiskey> yeh as its a string
[14:34:14] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey correct.  == is a bad thing to use.
[14:34:35] <Whiskey> i donÂ´t see why its matter
[14:34:42] <duch_kazatel> because it's unexpected.
[14:34:46] <duch_kazatel> 0 and '0' aren't the same thing.
[14:35:00] <Whiskey> one is a value and one is a string
[14:35:01] <duch_kazatel> implicitly acting like they are can lead to inintended side effects and bugs.
[14:35:09] <duch_kazatel> one is a number and the other is a string.
[14:35:11] <duch_kazatel> they are not the same thing.
[14:35:19] <Whiskey> i do get that
[14:35:25] <bondibox> taplar probably not, but still no error thown
[14:35:53] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey that's why you opt for === instead of ==.
[14:35:56] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: my english is so bad but you have the code
[14:36:06] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i'm not going to do a full code review for you.
[14:36:20] <duch_kazatel> nor am i going to rewrite anything for you.
[14:36:42] <bondibox> I think the problem lies in the omission of a key component, not a syntax error
[14:37:02] <bondibox> I've followed 3 jquery tutorials to no avail
[14:37:05] <duch_kazatel> bondibox what does your network tab tell you?
[14:37:13] <Whiskey> can you tell me about closures?
[14:37:15] <Whiskey> i think i miss that
[14:37:22] <Whiskey> but i donÂ´t get what it is
[14:37:27] <bondibox> Accept: html
[14:37:32] <duch_kazatel> bondibox also - JQuery.ajaxSetup{ isn't a thing.
[14:37:36] <duch_kazatel> jQuery.ajaxSetup is.
[14:38:32] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work
[14:39:14] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: you good on php?
[14:39:23] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey no.  that's better suited for ##php
[14:41:14] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey did you read that explanation?
[14:41:29] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: anyways its like classes for php i have read it alot fo times but never get it
[14:41:41] <duch_kazatel> what about them don't you understand?
[14:41:50] <plamb> taplar you around
[14:41:55] <taplar> yup
[14:42:13] <plamb> so i just realized
[14:42:21] <plamb> this actually isnt quite working yet
[14:42:22] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/17/
[14:42:32] <plamb> if you change the text in the inputs, it doesnt get the new text
[14:42:39] <Whiskey> everything :)
[14:42:49] <Whiskey> i just say im really slow some times :D
[14:42:51] <plamb> the selection of the new text works, but the .find to update the element does not
[14:43:05] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cprzq9r5/
[14:43:08] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: but does closure have anything whit returnto do?
[14:43:39] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey notice how in this example, when you call aNewObject, someVariable still magically exists?
[14:43:40] <plamb> i have trouble interpreting what console.log returns when you pass in a bound element
[14:43:46] <plamb> seems to be some huge data structure
[14:43:52] <Whiskey> I do get it
[14:44:05] <Whiskey> But i donÂ´t get other parts when you can have private and public and yeh all that crap
[14:44:15] <taplar> plamb: looking, btw, when you set the input with the text() make sure to trim() it
[14:44:19] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey javascript doesn't have private and public variables.
[14:44:25] <plamb> oh yeah
[14:44:42] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey the innerFunction in my example is a closure - it still has access to the other variables declared in someFunction.
[14:44:43] <Whiskey> then i donÂ´t see why use it at all
[14:45:03] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey php and javascript are two completely different languages.
[14:45:07] <duch_kazatel> anyway, i have to go to lunch.
[14:45:15] <duch_kazatel> good luck.
[14:45:24] <Whiskey> lol
[14:45:32] <taplar> plamb: k, the setting of the text is not working as your setting the val().  a 'p' element does not have a val(), just text()
[14:45:32] <Whiskey> donÂ´t even have the time to say goodbye :D
[14:45:49] <plamb> ahh so it should be .text() instead of .val() ?
[14:46:01] <Whiskey> i donÂ´t get it
[14:46:06] <taplar> yep, or html(), either one.  this case, text('new value') makes sense
[14:46:15] <plamb> roger
[14:46:28] <Whiskey> taplar: are you up for it, donÂ´t closure have to do whit memory?
[14:46:52] <taplar> closures are just methods passed in as parameters to another method for execution
[14:48:43] <Whiskey> hmmm as i say slow
[14:48:55] <taplar> hmm?
[14:57:38] <krambiorix> hi, i test my application (php/jquery) on my iphone. But nothing jquery related works... What can i do?
[15:02:06] <`ULT> buy a non-iphone phone
[15:07:30] <plamb> if i have a var stuff = element.children()
[15:07:37] <plamb> how do i return just the html out of stuff
[15:08:02] <taplar> stuff could be multiple elements
[15:08:24] <plamb> right so the html version of the elements contained in stuff
[15:08:58] <taplar> you could just do stuff.parent().html()
[15:09:14] <taplar> or element.html()
[15:09:32] <taplar> element.html() would probably be best
[15:10:08] <plamb> that returns the html of the children elements?
[15:10:26] <taplar> element.html() returns the inner html of the element
[15:10:36] <plamb> weird
[15:10:41] <plamb> hmm
[15:11:48] <plamb> works in fiddle but not in my project
[15:11:49] <plamb> fun times
[15:12:17] <taplar> if you want to see exactly what an element is you can try element.prop('outerHTML')
[15:12:38] <plamb> what does that return
[15:13:03] <taplar> $('<p><i>me</i></p>').html() == '<i>me</i>'
[15:13:12] <plamb> right
[15:13:21] <taplar> $('<p><i>me</i></p>').prop('outerHTML') == '<p><i>me</i></p>'
[15:13:58] <plamb> i see
[15:15:00] <VectorX> hi, if i have a div say height 100px, width 100%, can i background color each 20px height with a different color ? ie first 20px yellow, second blue, third red etc ?
[15:15:24] <taplar> VectorX: that sounds something like a gradient background
[15:15:33] <taplar> you might ask #css
[15:15:47] <taplar> or ##css, i forget if there are two pounds or what
[15:15:50] <VectorX> taplar i need the colors in specific areas
[15:17:10] <`ULT> hi taplar, i have a product and the price depents on the selected options.
[15:17:23] <`ULT> Now I need to store the realtime price
[15:17:34] <`ULT> I thougt this would do the trick, but no..
[15:17:38] <VectorX> which would need to be calculated using js
[15:17:57] <`ULT> console.log ($(".tb_price").text());
[15:17:57] <`ULT> $("input").change(function() {
[15:17:57] <`ULT> console.log ($(".tb_price").text());
[15:18:08] <taplar> `ULT: fiddle please
[15:18:19] <`ULT> yeah, the problem is that I cant make a fiddle.
[15:19:03] <`ULT> you can see here what I mean.
[15:19:11] <`ULT> http://www.kaskeus.nl/tuinkeus/index.php?route=product/product&path=33_62&product_id=444
[15:19:12] <taplar> doesn't have to work.  just something so i can see the script instead of it being pasted multi line in the chat
[15:19:26] <`ULT> you can check the console.log
[15:19:30] <`ULT> what is happening
[15:19:34] <`ULT> there is an delay
[15:19:49] <`ULT> check on a button
[15:19:54] <taplar> you got an error
[15:20:37] <`ULT> yeah, an error in the jquery.lightbox
[15:20:43] <`ULT> need to fix that another time.
[15:21:15] <taplar> what is the input that is changing?
[15:21:32] <`ULT> you need to press on collor and "type beglazing"
[15:21:33] <taplar> cause your console logging text() instead of whatever changed's val()
[15:21:53] <`ULT> i consolelog the price what is chaning.
[15:22:55] <taplar> where is 'collor' ?
[15:22:56] <plamb> taplar
[15:22:58] <plamb> $viewBlock.find('p').find('.fa-briefcase').outerHTML;
[15:23:17] <plamb> that would find a child in viewBlock, then find and .fa-briefcase in p then return its outerHTML
[15:23:19] <plamb> right?
[15:23:20] <taplar> prop('outerHTML')
[15:23:25] <`ULT> taplar: http://prntscr.com/8ouivb
[15:23:30] <`ULT> check the screen! :p
[15:25:54] <taplar> k
[15:25:55] <taplar> i was looking for a label, :)
[15:25:55] <`ULT> what do you mean?
[15:25:56] <`ULT> it is not clear than you can push the color?
[15:26:57] <taplar> looks like your doing that console.log before the text has been updated
[15:27:35] <`ULT> yes, that was my thinking also.
[15:27:52] <`ULT> that explains the delay.
[15:27:54] <taplar> yep, it console logs and there's a few milliseconds before the text changes
[15:28:04] <`ULT> do you have an idea how to fix?
[15:28:18] <`ULT> i can`t reach the php/ javascript for chaning the price.
[15:28:22] <`ULT> changing
[15:28:27] <taplar> so my guess would be both are driven by the click/change event and the console log event is bound after the change one
[15:28:36] <plamb> taplar: finally got it working
[15:28:37] <plamb> LoL
[15:28:42] <taplar> cool
[15:28:53] <`ULT> maybe I can set a delay?
[15:28:56] <plamb> working around my horribly written HTML
[15:29:22] <taplar> you could either put your console log logic also in your change logic, or bind your console logic before the change one
[15:29:36] <taplar> typically the last bound event handler fires first
[15:29:57] <`ULT> oke, tonight I will try that. Thanks for your suggestions.
[15:30:03] <`ULT> Need to go now for an hour.
[15:44:06] <plamb> how do you get .has() to return a boolean
[15:44:23] <taplar> what logic are you trying?
[15:44:44] <plamb>          if ($viewBlock.has('h3')){
[15:44:44] <plamb>            $viewBlock.find('h3').text($editBlock.find('input').val().trim());
[15:44:44] <plamb>            } else {
[15:44:46] <plamb>            $viewBlock.find('p').html($editBlock.find('input').val().trim());
[15:44:48] <plamb>            }
[15:44:58] <taplar> trying to see if a child exists?
[15:45:09] <plamb> indeed
[15:45:19] <taplar> parent.find('element').length > 0
[15:45:27] <plamb> interesting
[15:45:33] <taplar> or just the .length
[15:45:33] <plamb> so you cant easily turn .has into a boolean
[15:45:38] <taplar> 0 is truthy false
[15:46:08] <plamb> which seems like a straightforward use of .has
[15:46:16] <taplar> oh
[15:46:29] <taplar> actually parent.has('element').length looks like it should work too
[15:46:56] <plamb> so
[15:46:57] <plamb> if ($viewBlock.has('h3').length > 0)
[15:47:07] <taplar> the issue is that has() returns a jquery object of the results, but that jquery object is truthy true, no matter if it contains results or not
[15:47:17] <plamb> :(
[15:47:20] <taplar> yeah, and again, the > 0 is optional
[15:47:40] <plamb> so 0 is considered false
[15:47:43] <taplar> yep
[15:47:45] <plamb> any non 0 is true
[15:47:51] <taplar> numerically, yes
[15:48:41] <plamb> man i really need to start editting jquery in a real editor
[15:48:46] <plamb> and not intellij
[15:49:15] <taplar> i'm working in intellij now, :).  if your just doing javascript sublime text can be handy
[15:49:38] <plamb> there doesnt seem to be any syntax highlighting in intellij
[15:49:52] <plamb> granted
[15:50:02] <taplar> ah
[15:50:03] <plamb> im writing in a x.scala.html in <script> tags
[15:50:06] <plamb> not in a .js
[15:50:07] <plamb> LoL
[15:50:22] <taplar> i got highlighting
[15:50:30] <plamb> what type of file are you in?
[15:50:33] <plamb> is it a plugin?
[15:50:34] <taplar> .js
[15:50:44] <taplar> not sure, base install of the program
[15:50:48] <plamb> i see
[15:51:30] <taplar> oh which version do you have?
[15:51:41] <taplar> ult or community?
[15:51:52] <plamb> community
[15:52:04] <taplar> that's most likely what it is
[15:52:05] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18661145/intellij-community-edition-javascript-syntax-highlighting
[15:54:36] <plamb> man has this experience taught me a lot about being more careful with html
[15:55:57] <taplar> eh, write it to meet your current need.  can always change it later
[15:56:48] <plamb> yeah but when you've already built a bunch of technical debt into your CSS
[15:56:55] <plamb> going back and changing the html really messes things up
[15:56:56] <taplar> ah
[15:58:37] <taplar> i'll admit i've definately went back and forth on css styling going either classes that fully define an object vs many basic classes that can be used over and over.
[15:59:27] <blitz-_> I have a click event on an element inside a td. How do i select the nth td of that row in that event?
[15:59:38] <plamb> basically i wrote this profile page using html/css knowing i wanted to make it "editable" via jquery
[15:59:54] <plamb> but didnt consider how to structure it knowing the latter until after i'd already done the former
[16:00:07] <taplar> blitz-_: get the closest tr and then find the td:nth-child(#)
[16:00:37] <taplar> or find the closest tr, then all tds and do get(#) off of tthat
[16:01:15] <plamb> will a .show() override a display:none !important;
[16:01:28] <taplar> not sure
[16:01:51] <plamb> nope
[16:01:52] <plamb> :(
[16:02:01] <taplar> blitz-_: $(this).closest('tr').find('td:nth-child(4)')
[16:02:15] <taplar> blitz-_: $(this).closest('tr').find('td').get(4)
[16:02:18] <taplar> either
[16:03:23] <taplar> plamb: not surprising
[16:04:15] <taplar> optionally you could make a more specific matcher that does the display none, and then remove one of the classes so it shows
[16:04:54] <plamb> i modified the css successfully
[16:05:05] <plamb> parsing big chunks of scss is just annoying
[16:06:40] <taplar> do you use less?
[16:06:45] <plamb> sass
[16:07:22] <taplar> ah
[16:08:34] <taplar> well i'm out.  will probably jump back on in a bit after i get home.  if i don't decide to do some gaming, :)  l8r
[16:14:33] <adahox> i've a div element with id list-actions and inside this has a p element. $('#list-actions p').click() dont work. has something wrong?
[16:19:06] <adahox> !help
[16:20:33] <adahox> !help
[16:21:10] <NoiseEee> adahox: create a fiddle
[16:21:30] <LindsayM_> Arg... I can't get my actual JSON response to work the way it works in the jsfiddle...
[16:23:11] <LindsayM_> I have a success event in $.ajax that does 	success: function(response) { }, if I do a console.log(response); I get a nicely formatted array. HOWEVER if I do response.map() I get " response.map is not a function"
[16:23:29] <LindsayM_> but if I take the results of my json and copy and paste it into a var and do myVar.map() it works
[16:23:36] <LindsayM_> I dont understand the difference.
[16:36:57] <taplar> still here LindsayM_ ?
[16:38:42] <`ULT> hi taplar!
[16:38:48] <taplar> wb
[16:38:49] <plamb> what's wrong with this
[16:38:51] <plamb> elseif ($viewBlock.has('#bottomLinkedin').length)
[16:38:55] <duch_kazatel> else if
[16:38:59] <duch_kazatel> two works not one.
[16:39:03] <duch_kazatel> and .has() returns a boolean.
[16:39:09] <plamb> nuh uh
[16:39:16] <duch_kazatel> oh woops.
[16:39:16] <`ULT> I have fixed my problem but I dont think it is a nice way:     setTimeout(function(){ console.log ($(".tb_price").text()); }, 850);
[16:39:20] <plamb> why does this genius first show it as elseif
[16:39:20] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/has/ you're right.
[16:39:23] <plamb> http://css-plus.com/2011/07/jquery-if-else-statements/
[16:39:26] <`ULT> do you think it is?
[16:39:35] <plamb> >showing PHP first
[16:39:37] <plamb> who does this
[16:39:49] <taplar> i would think a better approach would be to put it in the logic that changes the value
[16:39:59] <duch_kazatel> plamb uh.. that was a comment on the post.
[16:40:08] <LindsayM_> taplar:  i am.. just plugging away
[16:40:11] <plamb> duch_kazatel: it would make sense for has to just return a boolean
[16:40:14] <plamb> no idea why it doesnt
[16:40:20] <`ULT> yeah taplar, but I cant find out where i can find that code.
[16:40:25] <duch_kazatel> plamb also, using .has() on an id is... weird.
[16:40:29] <taplar> LindsayM_, what do you get if you console.log( $.isArray(response) ) ?
[16:40:35] <`ULT> it is very complex stuff
[16:40:37] <plamb> :/
[16:40:38] <duch_kazatel> you could reduce that to just if ($('#bottomLinkedin').length) {}
[16:40:56] <duch_kazatel> since you can only have an ID once per page.
[16:41:13] <LindsayM_> ahhh taplar I get false...
[16:41:16] <LindsayM_> so... hmmm...
[16:41:20] <LindsayM_> why isn't response an array
[16:41:21] <LindsayM_> ?!
[16:41:22] <taplar> may be a string then
[16:41:34] <LindsayM_> taplar:  i tried doing makeArray
[16:41:40] <taplar> JSON.parse( response )
[16:41:46] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ try typeof response;
[16:41:51] <taplar> or $.parseJSON( response ) i think
[16:42:04] <duch_kazatel> if it's a string, do the JSON.parse(response);
[16:42:09] <LindsayM_> omg.. parse
[16:42:11] <LindsayM_> thats what I needed
[16:42:29] <taplar> when you said you could copy and paste it and it worked i figured that was what it was
[16:42:55] <`ULT> I have a product and the productprice is calculated by options. With     setTimeout(function(){ console.log ($(".tb_price").text()); }, 850); I can reach the price, but in my log I now get this result:
[16:43:08] <`ULT>       â¬ 2.595,00
[16:43:08] <`ULT>     â¬ 3.144,00â¬ 3.144,00
[16:43:23] <`ULT> three prices. I don`t understand why.
[16:43:33] <LindsayM_> ok now I feel like i'm making headway.. taplar duch_kazatel thanks again
[16:43:37] <duch_kazatel> you're calling the code multiple times then `ULT
[16:43:38] <taplar> how many elements have the class tb_price?
[16:44:05] <duch_kazatel> taplar .text() would return only one.
[16:44:12] <taplar> true
[16:44:38] <`ULT> only a span
[16:44:47] <`ULT> but why are i calling the code multiple times? :p
[16:44:54] <duch_kazatel> dunno, why are you?
[16:45:07] <`ULT> yeah why! thats the question..
[16:45:20] <duch_kazatel> uh...
[16:45:33] <duch_kazatel> you've only shown me the code that gets called.
[16:45:33] <`ULT> may i show you the code duch_kazatel?
[16:45:38] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle duder.
[16:45:53] <`ULT> sorry fiddle is not possible. I can give you the live code.
[16:45:57] <`ULT> site
[16:46:00] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[16:46:02] <duch_kazatel> wat
[16:46:08] <duch_kazatel> if it's JS, a fiddle IS possible.
[16:46:15] <`ULT> no
[16:46:19] <duch_kazatel> don't make me go spelunking through a site's source to find things.
[16:46:33] <`ULT> I show you!
[16:46:48] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[16:47:18] <`ULT> Do this: http://prntscr.com/8ouivb
[16:47:27] <duch_kazatel> uh
[16:47:28] <`ULT> and check the log: http://www.kaskeus.nl/tuinkeus/index.php?route=product/product&path=41_47&product_id=389
[16:47:34] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[16:47:50] <duch_kazatel> live isn't a function.
[16:47:59] <`ULT> no that is a bug I need to fix
[16:48:06] <duch_kazatel> ...
[16:48:08] <`ULT> it is in the opencart software
[16:48:09] <duch_kazatel> you need to fix that first.
[16:48:16] <taplar> lol, i'm getting deja vew
[16:48:20] <`ULT> haha
[16:48:31] <`ULT> it is not conflicting with my problem
[16:48:33] <duch_kazatel> seriously though, one error can cascade and cause others.
[16:48:44] <`ULT> oke I try to fix
[16:48:47] <duch_kazatel> so where is this supposedly unreproducable problem?
[16:49:08] <`ULT> It is in the jQuery lightbox plugin
[16:49:22] <duch_kazatel> so the issue IS something you could replicate in a fiddle.
[16:49:33] <LindsayM_> `ULT:  you're running the console log on every change of an 'input' element
[16:49:45] <`ULT> I can`t reach the code for changing the price
[16:49:49] <LindsayM_> `ULT: and you can DEFINITELY mak this work in a fiddle
[16:50:29] <`ULT> I can not reproduce the update price functions
[16:50:49] <`ULT> the other stuff is possible.
[16:50:52] <duch_kazatel> wat
[16:50:53] <LindsayM_> `ULT:  yea.. ya totally can
[16:51:00] <duch_kazatel> it's client-side code.
[16:51:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm not asking for the entire page.
[16:51:11] <duch_kazatel> or whatever - i'm asking for a reduced test case.
[16:51:29] <`ULT> Yes I understand that.
[16:51:42] <LindsayM_> `ULT:  then do it
[16:52:47] <`ULT> oke wish me luck
[16:52:55] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:53:02] <`ULT> I trie to reduce the code handling the price update
[16:53:04] <duch_kazatel> i feel like you're overcomplicating something here.
[16:53:05] <`ULT> *try
[16:53:12] <duch_kazatel> what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[16:53:27] <`ULT> A very small problem
[16:53:37] <duch_kazatel> then you don't need to supply much code.
[16:53:39] <`ULT> Totaalprijs inclusief toebehorens:	â¬ 2595.00
[16:53:47] <duch_kazatel> i closed your page fwiw.
[16:53:50] <`ULT> that price is working correct with the selected other prodcuts
[16:54:04] <`ULT> but not the updated price with options
[16:54:21] <LindsayM_> `ULT: basically the buttons that are green boxes arent updating the value of the otaalprijs inclusief toebehorens:	
[16:54:33] <LindsayM_> `ULT: correct?
[16:54:33] <`ULT> true!
[16:54:37] <`ULT> you are right.
[16:54:47] <duch_kazatel> are those green buttons checkboxes or something?
[16:55:00] <`ULT> yes.
[16:55:04] <`ULT> radiobuttons
[16:55:07] <duch_kazatel> so then this is totally reduable.
[16:55:09] <duch_kazatel> *reducable.
[16:55:31] <`ULT> the problem is something else. But my english isn`t good to explain that right.
[16:55:51] <LindsayM_> `ULT:  it seems like you have a few issues though
[16:56:15] <LindsayM_> `ULT:  the green buttons aren't updating the Totaalprijs inclusief toebehorens:	 but the bottom checkboxes aren't updating the top pricing
[16:56:44] <`ULT> I make a screenshot
[16:56:49] <LindsayM_> `ULT: the fact that your english is not good is even MORE of a reason to create a simplified version of this problem in a jsfiddle
[16:56:52] <duch_kazatel> no more screenshots.
[16:56:55] <LindsayM_> `ULT: screenshots dont help anything
[16:56:59] <duch_kazatel> screenshots are totally unhelpful.
[16:57:05] <duch_kazatel> giving us a reduced test case IS helpful.
[16:57:17] <duch_kazatel> let me show you what a reduced test case might look like.
[16:57:46] <taplar> heh, there are 3 tb_price elements on the page
[16:58:16] <`ULT> aah taplar, that is the first problem
[16:59:03] <taplar> the text() is actualy printing out the text of all three
[16:59:05] <`ULT> you have right, I found them also.
[16:59:21] <`ULT> that is explaing why we get three times the price value.
[17:01:34] <duch_kazatel> so you want to add up multiple sets of radio button values whenever one of them changes.
[17:01:36] <duch_kazatel> that sound right?
[17:02:32] <`ULT> uhm.
[17:03:04] <`ULT> when the mainprice of the product is updated by an option. I want that that price is also updating @ otaalprijs inclusief toebehorens:	â¬ 2595.00
[17:03:38] <duch_kazatel> so you want to update two fields whenever you add up the values on some radio buttons?
[17:03:54] <duch_kazatel> is otaalprijs inclusief toebehorens:	â¬ 2595.00 the cost plus something else?
[17:05:19] <`ULT> One more screenshot! http://prntscr.com/8ovwn5
[17:05:27] <`ULT> truethat duch_kazatel
[17:05:31] <duch_kazatel> no more screenshots.
[17:05:41] <`ULT> not only the main price, that is working correct, but also the totaalprijs inclusief
[17:05:46] <`ULT> you hate screenshots?
[17:05:51] <duch_kazatel> they're unhelpful.
[17:06:11] <`ULT> I can give you an jsfiddle
[17:06:20] <`ULT> Without the working options.
[17:06:35] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i need - i'm already showing you how to reduce this down to a test case.
[17:07:43] <`ULT> Oke, I try to make a very easy testcase.
[17:07:52] <duch_kazatel> don't waste your time.
[17:07:56] <duch_kazatel> i'm already almost done.
[17:11:41] <duch_kazatel> `ULT http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s6roq8eq/2/
[17:11:43] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[17:11:56] <duch_kazatel> a reduced test case that shows you updating two fields whenever a radio changes.
[17:13:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s6roq8eq/3/ here's a reduced test case showing both of those values changing whenever you update the price.
[17:14:04] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  you're too good sir,.
[17:14:16] <plamb> if i have <p><i></i>text<i></i></p> oh could element.has('i').length = 1 be true
[17:14:22] <plamb> where element is the <p>
[17:14:35] <duch_kazatel> use .find() imo.
[17:14:53] <duch_kazatel> and that would be 2, not 1, plamb
[17:14:57] <`ULT> Need to study that. Realy thankfull for your guys help.
[17:15:01] <plamb> i know but its returning 1
[17:16:00] <plamb> find made it return 2
[17:16:01] <duch_kazatel> sure, because there's a single p that has that descendent
[17:16:03] <plamb> wonder why has didnt
[17:16:11] <plamb> maybe it only searches for 1 result that true and returns
[17:16:15] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:16:27] <plamb> that would make sense
[17:16:33] <duch_kazatel> that's not what it's doing.
[17:16:36] <plamb> for something thats supposed to return a boolean
[17:16:55] <taplar> has is a short hand for filtering elements
[17:16:59] <duch_kazatel> element.has('i') reduces down the elements that have a given descendent.
[17:17:26] <duch_kazatel> so $('p').has('i'); would return 1, because there's a single p tag that contains at least one <i> element.
[17:17:39] <plamb> right exactly
[17:17:54] <duch_kazatel> so you return makes sense.
[17:18:02] <duch_kazatel> *your
[17:18:09] <duch_kazatel> `ULT do you get the basic idea?
[17:19:11] <`ULT> almost I think.
[17:19:14] <`ULT> one moment
[17:21:38] <plamb> why doesnt this work
[17:21:39] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/aua2jrzr/1/
[17:21:55] <duch_kazatel> $('p').css('color': 'red');
[17:22:09] <duch_kazatel> functions take arguments separated by commas.
[17:22:12] <duch_kazatel> : isn't valid there ;)
[17:22:29] <plamb> okay, why isnt the first one red?
[17:22:30] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/aua2jrzr/2/
[17:22:52] <taplar> 2 p's exist that have a child i
[17:23:05] <plamb> ya but one .length should be 2
[17:23:05] <duch_kazatel> less than or equal to 1
[17:23:13] <duch_kazatel> because $('p').find('i').length is 2 here.
[17:23:24] <duch_kazatel> becuase you have 2 <p> elements with at least one <i> descendent
[17:23:41] <plamb> how would you write the conditional to do what im trying to do
[17:23:46] <duch_kazatel> use .each()
[17:24:15] <duch_kazatel> with .find()
[17:25:14] <plamb> umm
[17:25:34] <duch_kazatel> you need to put the conditional inside of an .each() and check each one independently.
[17:25:40] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you have no context in your code.
[17:30:01] <taplar> what about this?  too complex for what it's doing? $('p').css('color', 'red').has('i:nth-child(2)').css('color', 'blue');
[17:30:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm not a fan of complex selectors.
[17:30:30] <duch_kazatel> always gets people tripped up, but that's legit.
[17:30:32] <plamb> ok how about this duch_kazatel
[17:30:33] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/aua2jrzr/4/
[17:30:58] <plamb> oh wait
[17:31:00] <plamb> DONT CLICK
[17:31:01] <plamb> L!OL
[17:31:04] <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:31:17] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/aua2jrzr/5/
[17:31:18] <plamb> okay now
[17:31:45] <duch_kazatel> why ios there suddenly an event binding?
[17:31:47] <`ULT> The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.
[17:31:55] <plamb> now it better reflects my code
[17:31:56] <duch_kazatel> plamb http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aua2jrzr/3/ this is all you needed.
[17:32:27] <`ULT> I understand your code.
[17:32:27] <plamb> i need it to determine if the <p> has 1 or more 'i' children whne something is cicked
[17:32:29] <plamb> clicked
[17:32:59] <`ULT> But I can`t write such a thing by myself.
[17:33:48] <duch_kazatel> `ULT which is why you learn how.
[17:34:35] <`ULT> I can understand single methods and fucntions. But combo`s are realy hard.
[17:34:41] <duch_kazatel> chaining.
[17:34:47] <duch_kazatel> that's all about understanding return types.
[17:34:48] <`ULT> yes.
[17:34:52] <duch_kazatel> i don't normally write code like that
[17:34:55] <duch_kazatel> but it's a way to do it.
[17:35:31] <`ULT> code is built of a lot of few little things.
[17:35:42] <duch_kazatel> "a lot of few"?
[17:35:51] <`ULT> alot :p
[17:35:52] <`ULT> haha
[17:35:53] <`ULT> sorry
[17:35:58] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:36:06] <duch_kazatel> and it's not as many as you'd think.
[17:36:07] <`ULT> it are all little parts to make something biggers
[17:36:26] <`ULT> For me it is hard to combine that little parts to something biggers.
[17:36:29] <duch_kazatel> you really just need to start exploring and recognizing when things seem a little too hard or awkward.
[17:36:45] <duch_kazatel> thinking like a progammer and breaking the problem down is the hard part.
[17:36:52] <duch_kazatel> memorizing methods and things is easy.
[17:37:41] <`ULT> Haha, yes indeed.
[17:38:07] <`ULT> some day..
[17:38:59] <`ULT> Many thanks. Need to sleep.
[17:39:04] <`ULT> Nn!
[17:40:57] <noahmg123> I am working on large html project, and unfortunately, the people who made what I am working on did not make divs that would make it easier for me to do my part (and I cannot change it manually as it would require a few days of work at the least). In short there is text with sections with headings like "1:1" (example: "1:1 this is the first past 1:2 this is the next part 2:1 this is the third 2:2 this is the fourth" etc.) What
[17:40:59] <noahmg123> is the easiest way to scan through the text (which may be split across divs) and wrap each section and it's heading in a div (and possibly add it's heading (only with a dash) as an id)?
[17:42:07] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 make a fiddle as an example.
[17:42:47] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: sure. I actually am gonna eat dinner right now so I'l be back on in a bit.
[17:43:43] <duch_kazatel> in short, yes your request is feasible, but it's really strange and going to be kind of awkward :)
[17:44:26] <noahmg123> ok  thx
[17:47:51] <illmatix> I have a bunch of form elements i want to populate then trigger change on for this auto submit to do it's thing. how could i do this? Currently i have all the fields being set and I tried triggering change on the form but that didn't work.
[17:48:31] <taplar> the elements would have the change event, not the form
[17:48:55] <duch_kazatel> $('form').on('change', 'input
[17:49:03] <duch_kazatel> err, $('form').on('change', 'input', function() {});
[17:50:25] <taplar> though auto submit on a field change?  if multiple change that would be a querk
[17:51:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah i wouldn't do that personally.
[17:53:36] <illmatix> oh yeah?
[17:53:44] <duch_kazatel> submit on every field change?
[17:53:49] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[17:54:19] <illmatix> well this is a thing drupal has on the exposed filters. When enabled it submits the form.
[17:54:54] <illmatix> I think initially the client didn't realise what they were asking but it's builtnow and just cleaning up some extra funtionality that wasn't completed by another dev.
[17:55:33] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:56:46] <duch_kazatel> illmatix so what happens when a user makes 3 separate changes before the first one finishes submitting?
[17:57:25] <illmatix> duch_kazatel well that's what i'm trying to figure out. I want to make a single change happen so that i'ts not trying to shove multple changes in.
[17:57:49] <duch_kazatel> then you won't really have the feature you want.
[17:58:30] <illmatix> well i can update tghe value of the elements and not have change triggered.
[17:59:00] <taplar> if your logically going to change multiple and want a submit, it would make sense to set them and then just submit the form
[17:59:44] <illmatix> Yeah that's what i was thinking. It would be far easier then relying on this existing auto submit module.
[18:00:02] <taplar> not letting the user change more than one before the auto submit finishes, might be a use case for an overlay
[18:04:48] <Kamuela> anyone know how to do delete vs. backspace on a mac?
[18:04:54] <Kamuela> probably some kind of modifier on the delete key?
[18:06:33] <Kamuela> Ok the modifier is function
[18:06:42] <Kamuela> fn+delete = delete, delete=backspace
[18:07:07] * Kamuela investigates other uses of fn and hopes one of them isnât restart and wipe machine

[18:09:38] <Phoenixz> Anybody with experience with jquery validator? I'm having a problem with a form that uses .remote() with a remote URL, I have to click the submit button twice.. Now, I've found that this has to do with the async nature of .remote() conflicting with the validator not waiting for its result. So far, the only "solution" I've found was "use async: false" but that makes the page freeze during validation, and is also not an option...
[18:09:38] <Phoenixz> Anybody who might know about a solution for this issue?
[18:12:48] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: I think I may actually try something mysef on this.

[19:37:57] <duch_kazatel> use .map() instead.
[19:38:20] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: using map into for? http://jsfiddle.net/gSBCd/195/
[19:40:18] <duch_kazatel> instead of for.
[19:40:23] <duch_kazatel> like, don't use for loops.
[19:40:24] <duch_kazatel> they're bad.
[19:40:35] <Qiller> oO
[19:41:03] <duch_kazatel> one sec and i'll show you what you need to do.
[19:41:24] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: $(this).get(0).files[4].name, file 4 = big. i need remove this ^^
[19:41:32] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[19:41:35] <Qiller> ok, http://jsfiddle.net/gSBCd/195/
[19:41:48] <duch_kazatel> one sec.  slow down ;)
[19:41:53] <Qiller> for example, files[4], ok ^^
[19:42:01] <duch_kazatel> i know how arrays work ;)
[19:44:14] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i'm not going to have time now - check out using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map instead of using a for loop.
[19:44:30] <duch_kazatel> so basically this.files.map(function() {});
[19:45:36] <duch_kazatel> and use that function to figure it out from there.
[19:45:41] <duch_kazatel> assuming i understand what you're asking :)
