[00:01:54] <nobitanobi> Using: http://www.laktek.com/2008/10/27/really-simple-color-picker-in-jquery/ — I load the library, but when trying to add a colorpicker to an element - I get "cannot ready property guid of undefined". Any thoughts?

[00:07:36] <yousaf> hi all
[00:07:50] <yousaf> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/Am5w3/
[00:07:57] <ravenzz> hello
[00:08:18] <yousaf> how can I loop through each #ui-id and have a relevant function for it?
[00:08:38] <ravenzz> ?each @ yousaf
[00:08:47] <ravenzz> come on bawt
[00:09:09] <ravenzz> yousaf http://api.jquery.com/each/
[00:09:12] <yousaf> basically, wordpress generates elements like #ui-id-2, #ui-id-3, #ui-id-5 so i need to have a jquery function for each of them
[00:12:39] <wachpwnski> can someone give me a good example of how $.with() works?
[00:12:57] <roskel> solved. async from $.ajax() does exact what i need.
[00:14:03] <ravenzz> wachpwnski there are examples in the docs
[00:15:07] <wachpwnski> What I am saying $.with( $.ajax() ).done( // do something else );
[00:15:15] <wachpwnski> that is pretty much the idea right?
[00:15:16] <ravenzz> is when
[00:15:17] <ravenzz> btw
[00:15:50] <ravenzz> you should read this http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[00:16:58] <ravenzz> I don't know any good article on this topic, but you can google jquery deferred.
[00:17:26] <ravenzz> from a quick scan this seems alright http://joseoncode.com/2011/09/26/a-walkthrough-jquery-deferred-and-promise/
[00:22:17] <aqeel> $(this).autoscroll("pause").delay(t || $.fn.autoscroll.defaults.delay, k, function () {$(this).autoscroll("resume");});
[00:22:25] <aqeel> this does delay() but not resume
[00:24:17] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/H58fK/
[00:32:15] <javalover> hello?
[00:38:13] <yousaf> Can someone please help? trying to get this on click map issue sorted http://jsfiddle.net/hL26n/
[00:38:53] <yousaf> basically, if you click on "head office" the map loads fine but when you click on other tabs the map isn't displaying properly
[00:40:48] <klawd> yousaf: still with the maps and the tabs?
[00:40:57] <yousaf> believe it or not yes klawd
[00:40:59] <yousaf> :/
[00:41:58] <klawd> yousaf: i dont even know where to click in your fiddle
[00:42:13] <yousaf> the tabs on the left
[00:43:13] <klawd> yousaf: that's way too much stuff to debug for me or anyone else here
[00:43:30] <klawd> break it down to a simple example
[00:48:23] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/2SDny/12/ - my jQuery is suppose to extend the grey box to the full width of the page if some above content pushes it down below the sidebar. This works fine now. But why, if the user resizes the window, does the box end up pushing itself down below the sidebar?
[00:51:19] <AL13N_work> how can i clone a DOM element? for insertion at another place
[00:51:49] <aqeel> .clone(),.html()
[00:52:00] <AL13N_work> thx
[00:52:42] <AL13N_work> aqeel: i didn't think of html()... which one do you think is faster?
[00:53:42] <aqeel> i personally have used html() more than clone()
[00:53:57] <AL13N_work> it's for a table row, if it matters
[00:54:13] <aqeel> but both of them have their own pros can cons
[00:54:44] <AL13N_work> aqeel: hmm, they don't have the same effects?
[00:55:03] <AL13N_work> aqeel: what kind of difference is there?
[00:55:45] <AL13N_work> aqeel: don't tell me the .clone() has the children equal and not-cloned
[00:56:01] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/html/
[00:56:11] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[00:56:38] <AL13N_work> aaah, event handlers
[00:58:42] <AL13N_work> aqeel: if it has no direct events, (since i'm using on) then i should be fine, no?
[00:59:16] <aqeel> yes but use within your on so event will buble up
[01:05:24] <AL13N_work> aqeel: wdym? you mean i should clone somewhere inside the on() functions?
[01:05:28] <AL13N_work> or?
[01:05:36] <AL13N_work> ah
[01:05:38] <dblosevn> nice i never looked at the docs on clone didnt know you could keep data and handlers in tact after the clone
[01:05:51] <AL13N_work> you mean i should append the new one below the same parent
[01:05:54] <dblosevn> i just always i assumed you had to rebind them
[01:06:19] <aqeel> yes
[01:06:28] <aqeel> inside the on()
[01:06:40] <dblosevn> so that gives clone a hell of an advantage over .html
[01:07:07] <aqeel> hehe..
[01:07:16] <aqeel> told you they have their own prox and cons
[01:07:22] <aqeel> pros*
[01:08:13] <AL13N_work> aqeel: yes, you did...
[01:08:18] <dblosevn> plus its got to be faster to copy an exitsting dom node tree then it is to serialize an existing one and rebuild it
[01:08:45] <aqeel> +1 point there
[01:09:16] <AL13N_work> especially if you don't need to copy over data and events
[01:09:20] <enbergj> I've got a $('input').bind('keyup', function() { ... }); handler, seems to work great with text inputs, but not with <input type="checkbox">, the event never seems to be triggered when enter, space, or anything is pressed with a checkbox focused .. any way around this?
[01:10:31] <dblosevn> enbergj: im not sure checkbox has a keyup event
[01:10:38] <AL13N_work> if a jQuery object has 2 element in it, i suppose i can just do $foo[0] and $foo[1] ? since .length also works?
[01:10:38] <enbergj> oh, also it doesn't seem to keep the focus when clicked, but manually focusing it doesn't seem to help either
[01:10:57] <aqeel> :checked
[01:11:16] <dblosevn> enbergj: its not a text input field so i have no clue why it would support keyup
[01:11:52] <aqeel> enbergj: http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[01:12:00] <dblosevn> perhaps you could bubble the keyup to a parent container and solve this problem
[01:12:06] <aqeel> enbergj: http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[01:12:16] <enbergj> dblosevn: what I'm trying to do, is that when any field in my dialog is selected and you press enter, it executes the changes .. works for the text inputs, not after you click checkboxes
[01:12:31] <enbergj> I don't really care if it's checked or not
[01:13:00] <aqeel> use checbox selector
[01:13:02] <enbergj> maybe I need to make an onclick handler that just focuses a textfield instead
[01:13:06] <dblosevn> enbergj: on change on the checkbox make the next field in line gett focus
[01:13:08] <wachpwnski> Anyone know why it is when i call coreload() on here I get loading core, auto loading, Fail, Success, Complete on here: https://gist.github.com/4e6b33646b550aee05da
[01:13:54] <dblosevn> or bind a keyup event to document and trigger the submit
[01:14:04] <dblosevn> thats probally the cleanest solution
[01:14:28] <dblosevn> either document or window
[01:15:23] <dblosevn> the keyup event should buddle all the way up to window as long as you havent stopped its propagtion
[01:16:05] <subdesign> parse string equivalent in javascript?
[01:16:25] <dblosevn> subdesign: parse string to what?
[01:16:35] <subdesign> no, integer to string
[01:17:13] <dblosevn> int.toString()
[01:17:21] <subdesign> ah yeah, ty
[01:17:27] <dblosevn> np
[01:17:43] <dblosevn> its going the other way around that requires a bit more
[01:17:56] <dblosevn> parseInt(string) to go back
[01:18:34] <enbergj> bah, fixed it with the global listener
[01:18:49] <yousaf> how can I add/embed an iframe when a user clicks on a tab?
[01:18:51] <dblosevn> enbergj: pretty sure thats what i sugested lol
[01:19:04] <enbergj> indeed
[01:19:42] <enbergj> tried a while to get anything out of the checkbox, nothing seemed to work, remembered I already had a global listener implemented that just didn't listen to Enter, just ESC, so I added Enter to it and now it's done
[01:20:23] <dblosevn> yousaf: var $ifrm = $('your-container-selector').append('<iframe />');$ifrm.prop('src', 'http://');
[01:20:43] <dblosevn> enbergj: im telling you i really dont think checkboxes even have the key events
[01:21:03] <dblosevn> *even fire
[01:22:21] <yousaf> dblosevn like this? http://jsfiddle.net/X2NaB/8/
[01:22:53] <enbergj> yes yes, so it would seem, the issue is resolved, so it really doesn't matter to me anymore ;)
[01:24:46] <dblosevn> yousaf: http://jsfiddle.net/F49YV/
[01:25:11] <yousaf> thank but that displays without me clicking on something
[01:25:34] <dblosevn> yousaf: your fiddle didnt even try to do that
[01:26:01] <yousaf> sorry, here is what I kinda need http://jsfiddle.net/F49YV/1/
[01:26:46] <dblosevn> yousaf: http://jsfiddle.net/F49YV/2/
[01:27:05] <yousaf> oh thank you so much!
[01:27:08] <yousaf> I hope this works now
[01:29:18] <aqeel> everytime you click you get a map
[01:29:25] <aqeel> might wanna break out
[01:31:45] <dblosevn> aqeel: good catch http://jsfiddle.net/F49YV/3/
[01:32:10] <aqeel> you are welcome
[01:32:40] <dblosevn> yousaf: use my new example instead
[01:33:14] <yousaf> thank you
[01:33:16] <yousaf> lets see
[01:34:42] <dblosevn> yousaf: that way the link only does something on the first click, gues i could have used .one as well
[01:36:19] <dblosevn> example using .one instead of classes http://jsfiddle.net/FZf7W/
[01:46:34] <yousaf> thank you
[01:47:14] <dblosevn> np
[01:47:47] <yousaf> google maps is weird, i have several maps inside tabs and the marker get set to top left for some reason
[01:48:21] <milligan> I have a servlet that returns a String, which is a base64 encoded image. How can I easiest get this value into a javascript function I have? i.e var image = $.get('/ServletName'); <- that pseudo-code is the desired result.
[01:50:09] <AdamPDotty> Is it possible to use .off on a subset like intended in http://jsfiddle.net/BERCr/ ?
[01:50:15] <Cork> milligan: $.get('/servletName', function(image) {});
[01:50:50] <milligan> Cork, simply declare var image above the $.get ?
[01:51:01] <Cork> no image exists in the callbck
[01:51:04] <Cork> *callback
[01:51:29] <milligan> Any way to access the data outside the callback ?
[01:51:37] <Cork> no
[01:51:40] <milligan> shit
[01:51:52] <Cork> ajax is async so the code outside will have executed before image is set
[01:52:38] <Cork> milligan: you can return the jqXHR object and use the callback where ever you want though
[01:53:21] <Cork> ex function do(url) { return $.ajax(url); };  do('/ServletName').done(function(image) { });
[01:53:55] <Cork> AdamPDotty: no off can't help you there
[01:54:01] <yousaf> dblosevn can I PM you a URL?
[01:54:03] <Cork> AdamPDotty: you can stop the event though
[01:54:29] <dblosevn> yousaf: ok
[01:55:00] <Cork> AdamPDotty: http://jsfiddle.net/BERCr/2/
[01:55:46] <yousaf> the URL I sent you, if you click on the tabs the marker on the maps are always aligned top left, this may not be a jquery issue but any ideas on how I could fix this?
[01:56:36] <dblosevn> yousaf: im thinking because the iframes are rendered before they are visible maybe google cant get the map centered on the markers
[01:56:39] <AdamPDotty> Cork: should be .on() on fieldset but thanks for the help
[01:56:50] <Cork> opps ya
[01:56:51] <Cork> :D
[01:56:57] <Cork> forgot to change that part
[01:57:33] <wachpwnski> how do you get the http status code of an ajax request?
[01:57:44] <Cork> its in the status variable
[01:58:02] <wachpwnski> It gives me the error name and number
[01:58:05] <wachpwnski> I just need the numeric
[01:58:26] <wachpwnski> jqXHR.status ?
[01:59:03] <Cork> jqxhr.status
[01:59:05] <Cork> yes
[01:59:17] <wachpwnski> oh im dumb. never mind
[01:59:18] <wachpwnski> lol
[01:59:41] <wachpwnski> console.log("Can't complete request: "+jqXHR.status);  Why is it giving me text? Do I have to parse it out? :D
[01:59:49] <Cork> side note though, you won't ever get 3xx statuses
[01:59:56] <AL13N_work> i'm looking for an efficient way to combine the text() fields of several dom objects. without resorting to each()
[02:00:14] <yousaf> dblosevn you are right and apart from the first map the others don't work on ipad etc
[02:00:17] <Cork> wachpwnski: yes if you feel you need it as numeric
[02:00:22] <wachpwnski> I am using the .done() and .fail() now
[02:00:33] <Cork> wachpwnski: its text so no reason to convert it if you don't need it converted
[02:00:36] <AL13N_work> maybe .map() or .makeArray() would work well?
[02:01:07] <Cork> wachpwnski: is text as in, http statuses is always text on the protocol level
[02:01:35] <wachpwnski> yah, you can just do something like jqXHR.status === '500' or something
[02:02:08] <Cork> AL13N_work: $.map($('input), function(elm) { return $(this).val(); })
[02:02:17] <Cork> wachpwnski: exactly
[02:02:47] <Cork> AL13N_work: and no you can't ever do anything on the array
[02:02:58] <wachpwnski> Can you forward different functions by status codes? I know ajax does a "statusCodes" thing and you can do functions based on that.
[02:03:00] <ItsJustMe> Do you know a tooltip plugin that opens at position of the triggering element (not linked to the mouse), has a close button and is free? :)
[02:03:12] <Cork> AL13N_work: there is no converter to convert dom element for input elements to the value of the input field
[02:03:36] <Cork> wachpwnski: forward?
[02:03:54] <Cork> you mean the .done/fail structure?
[02:04:15] <Cork> (its called deferred)
[02:04:17] <wachpwnski> statusCode { 200: function() {} } sort of thing
[02:04:33] <Cork> that works in the object you can give to ajax
[02:04:35] <Cork> no where lese
[02:04:37] <Cork> *else
[02:05:35] <Cork> just do if(jqXHR.status !== '200') { return } the first thing you do in the callback
[02:06:00] <wachpwnski> I would do that in my done right?
[02:06:07] <Cork> yes
[02:06:29] <wachpwnski> so 2xx is done, 4xx and 5xx is error?
[02:06:34] <Cork> yes
[02:06:41] <Cork> ?g http status wiki

[02:07:46] <Cork> ya, but i was to lazy to make a real google search
[02:07:50] <wachpwnski> Just to make sure I'm on the right track. I need to make sure an ajax request goes through before any other ones. So I use defered, and I will need pipe too?
[02:08:04] <Cork> and i knew that a plain google search would give the wrong hit
[02:08:08] <TomWij> Cork: Ah, didn't note the ?g there, you've got me. :D
[02:08:43] <Cork> wachpwnski: pipe?
[02:09:35] <wachpwnski> don't i need to .pipe my deferred?
[02:09:48] <Cork> ?.pipe
[02:09:49] <bot-t1> deferred.pipe([doneFilter], [failFilter]): [New in v1.6] Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[02:09:53] <Cork> AH
[02:10:05] * Cork nods
[02:10:07] <Cork> sure
[02:11:29] <Cork> wachpwnski: haven't used pipe my self, but it should actually be able to do the status filtering you want
[02:11:34] <Cork> i think at least
[02:11:46] <wachpwnski> Cork: I had an issue. I was using $.when, and it was still executing both the success and fail handler
[02:11:56] <wachpwnski> and not waiting for the request to finish
[02:12:33] <Cork> can't help you too much with pipe, not ever sure what the code does underneath'
[02:12:50] <wachpwnski> $.when( $.ajax('test.json') ).then( successHandler(), failHandler() );
[02:13:10] <wachpwnski> I was getting calls from both functions, and they were executing before the ajax request was finished.
[02:14:13] <Cork> that line triggered successHandler AND failHandler before the ajax call finished?
[02:16:09] <wachpwnski> Cork:  yes
[02:16:47] <Cork> that... doesn't make any sense
[02:16:50] <wachpwnski> Cork:  https://gist.github.com/4e6b33646b550aee05da this:
[02:18:13] <Cork> wachpwnski: that code has lots of problematic variables
[02:18:42] <wachpwnski> the the functions?
[02:18:48] <Cork> yes
[02:18:50] <wachpwnski> like the functions?
[02:18:59] <Cork> you use showfail before you declare it
[02:19:01] <wachpwnski> shoudl I delcare them as var name = function()
[02:19:05] <Cork> you don't declare you variables
[02:19:36] <Cork> and you're executing the functions instead of passing them
[02:20:04] <wachpwnski> hahah
[02:20:19] <wachpwnski> autoload = function() {} will execute regardless?
[02:20:25] <Cork> no
[02:20:27] <Cork> then(autoload(), showfail()) <--
[02:20:39] <Cork> that will try to give the return values from autoload and showfail to then
[02:20:42] <Cork> not the functions
[02:21:06] <wachpwnski> oh so i should do something like .then(autoload, showfail)
[02:21:08] <wachpwnski> ?
[02:21:10] <Cork> yes
[02:23:08] <AL13N_work> Cork: it's not form elements
[02:23:10] <AL13N_work> http://jsperf.com/joining-multiple-text
[02:23:24] <Cork> ah
[02:23:25] <AL13N_work> does anyone have any other ideas?
[02:23:38] <AL13N_work> plz add some extra tests if there's other ways
[02:24:11] <Cork> AL13N_work: so $('span').text() ?
[02:26:52] <AL13N_work> Cork: btw: is there in jsperf a way to check if the result is what is expected?
[02:27:13] <Cork> AL13N_work: use jsfiddle and the console
[02:27:36] <AL13N_work> hmm, ok
[02:27:55] <AL13N_work> it would be nice to return true or false after completion of tests in jsperf though
[02:28:01] <AL13N_work> anyway
[02:28:36] <AL13N_work> Cork: so, no other ideas on how to do this?
[02:28:55] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/3T5zZ/2/
[02:29:54] <ItsJustMe> I do not really understand the ajax documentation .. Could someone give me an example of: Click on specific div, async. connection to some.php, handling if database query could be finished and if so - set another pic to clicked div?
[02:31:20] <AL13N_work> Cork: how accurate is this for random strings?
[02:31:26] <Cork> ItsJustMe: $.ajax(url, { context: this }).done(function(img) { $(this).css('background-image', 'url(' + img + ')') });
[02:31:40] <Cork> AL13N_work: random strings?
[02:31:41] <eniac> I've got a .fail function which takes data as param. Next I wish to remove a p tag from the data.responseText but this never works. http://dpaste.org/zAOOa/
[02:32:22] <AL13N_work> Cork: in the jsfiddle, you're doing string replaces, but is this all the chars that will be replaced by the text() string?
[02:32:37] <ItsJustMe> Cork: So I just put this snippet within a $("target").on(.... and it knows if the db-query was executed or failed?
[02:33:09] <Cork> eniac: if that shold work or not is hard to say depending on what the html structure is in response
[02:33:32] <Cork> AL13N_work: i'm just removing duplicate spaces and line brakes
[02:33:37] <Cork> nothing else
[02:33:56] <Cork> ItsJustMe: that depends on the server code
[02:34:19] <Cork> ItsJustMe: the server code should return a 200 status if is success and a 500 if it didn't
[02:34:29] <ItsJustMe> okay :)
[02:34:33] <Cork> ItsJustMe: or you have to send a json instead of the simple img url
[02:34:33] <ItsJustMe> thx.
[02:35:01] <Cork> and ex have {"status":200, "url":"http://"}
[02:35:18] <eniac> Cork: http://dpaste.org/qESam/ I've added the html response.
[02:35:23] <Cork> and ex have {"status":500, "error":{<info>}}
[02:35:50] <Cork> eniac: and thats the entire content of the response?
[02:36:02] <eniac> Cork: yes
[02:37:39] <dblosevn> hey cork, you ever play with iis hostable web core?
[02:39:19] <eniac> Cork: might it be because it's not enclosed within html > body tags ?
[02:40:01] <dblosevn> i want to deliver a web application as a software package, with a chromeless fullscreen webkit kiosk view (eg no contorls/toolbars) and its own webserver prepackaged
[02:43:00] <Cork> eniac: no
[02:46:42] <crooksey_> Can I use "sortable" as well as drag and drop between Divs at the same time?
[02:47:04] <dblosevn> crooksey_: the docs clearly say yes
[02:47:35] <Cork> eniac: this is what you need to do http://jsfiddle.net/Hs4fz/
[02:47:44] <dblosevn> crooksey_: a sortable can also be a draggable and droppable
[02:47:47] <Cork> (the input.val simulates your ajax response)
[02:48:07] <crooksey_> dblosevn: thanks can I also use jquery to get the current position of the item in the div
[02:48:37] <dblosevn> crooksey_: cant remember where it is but the sortable will tell you the item index when its sorted
[02:49:00] <dblosevn> crooksey_: i think its in the ui object in the callback
[02:54:14] <dblosevn> crooksey_: ya it is http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-sort
[02:56:32] <eniac> Cork: thanks! But that doesn't work when integrated with my existing code.
[02:57:03] <Cork> eniac: it does you just have to change where it takes the data from
[02:57:13] <Cork> if you check what it does it does almost the same thing
[02:57:45] <Cork> eniac: but you need to reparate out the removal of the p elements onto its own line
[02:57:55] <ruby_on_tails> how can i attach a function to 2 different types of events ?
[02:58:19] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: either assign the two events at once
[02:58:25] <Cork> or use a named function
[02:58:37] <Cork> .on('click keypress', function() {});
[02:58:47] <ruby_on_tails> thats 2 events on the same element
[02:58:58] <ruby_on_tails> i mean to completely different types of triggers
[02:58:59] <Cork> function handler() {}; on('click', hanlder').on('keypress', handler);
[02:59:15] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[02:59:16] <Cork> those two does the same thing ^
[02:59:26] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[03:00:35] <AL13N_work> Cork: i got 2 & 3 ok, but 1, 4 & 5 are not successfull: http://jsfiddle.net/3T5zZ/3/
[03:03:01] <kelye> anyone using plupload with drag and drop ?
[03:05:48] <eniac> Cork: still having trouble with the script.
[03:05:57] <eniac> Cork: $($(data.responseText).val()); returns an empty array []
[03:06:05] <R00tk3y> Hey I have a question, how would I go about making a "load more comments" script, how would I store how many comments were loaded?
[03:08:20] <francois_> Hello, I have a problem using $.fn.load(fn) : the callback is never loaded. I call it on a "a" with an "img" inside... Any help ?
[03:08:30] <francois_> never called *
[03:09:40] <wachpwnski> If you use .on instead of .live, you dont have to use .delegate anymore do you?
[03:11:34] <ruby_on_tails> how can i use .html() the opposite way ? by applying it on the content being added ?
[03:11:40] <ruby_on_tails> like .append has .appendTo
[03:11:44] <ruby_on_tails> to reverse the selectors
[03:11:51] <francois_> Here is the code : http://snippi.com/s/0yd5xos the first console.log return an jQuery object fine, but the functions in .load() are never called
[03:16:31] <francois_> even with live('load',fn)
[03:16:55] <seutje> francois_: load is generally problematic with images see ?g jquery imagesloaded
[03:16:56] <bot-t1> francois_, jQuery imagesLoaded - http://desandro.github.com/imagesloaded/
[03:17:28] <francois_> seutje: ok thank you !
[03:17:30] <seutje> francois_: see the caveats part on http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[03:23:38] <francois_> seutje: interesting. thanks
[03:25:19] <francois_> seutje: maybe there is another shortcut than using load callback to get the height() and width() of the image ? without using the plugin ?
[03:25:28] <tongueWORK> hmm, jag tänkte att du hade fast pris alltså
[03:25:33] <tongueWORK> hmm
[03:25:33] <tongueWORK> :P
[03:25:41] <cuddle`> hello, I have a question about mouseenter() and mouseleave(). I wrote a for loop that creates mouse enter() and mouse leave() for multiple selectors. But it seems to always trigger the last selector in the for loop
[03:25:42] <tongueWORK> sorry
[03:25:54] <seutje> francois_: not reliably, no
[03:26:08] <seutje> francois_: you could throw it on a window load, but not sure how reliable that would be
[03:26:12] <AL13N_work> Cork: i found something nice, you can find out if the output is false by returning false when not matching the expected output in the end
[03:26:23] <AL13N_work> http://jsperf.com/joining-multiple-text
[03:26:47] <francois_> seutje: ok then, I will try the plugin :) thanks
[03:27:03] <cuddle`> does anyone know how I can have the mouse enter trigger the selector it was initially assigned to
[03:27:04] <cuddle`> ?
[03:33:08] <dns-away> holla <3
[03:33:37] <dblosevn> cuddle`: ask better questions and your more likely to get an asnwer
[03:34:04] <cuddle`> hmm
[03:34:25] <cuddle`> was it unclear?
[03:36:29] <dblosevn> cuddle`: well forinstance do the selectors overlap, what is the dom structure, what events are being fired, and what does "how I can have the mouse enter trigger the selector it was initially assigned to" even mean
[03:36:37] <cuddle`> haha
[03:36:40] <cuddle`> sorry about that
[03:37:57] <dblosevn> cuddle`: it would help greatly if you ?demo
[03:37:59] <cuddle`> heres my object
[03:38:00] <cuddle`> http://jsfiddle.net/rSAUC/
[03:38:09] <cuddle`> the demo didn't work really well
[03:38:10] <cuddle`> ):
[03:38:14] <cuddle`> I tried for a bit
[03:38:33] <cuddle`> I think I need to return the function
[03:38:36] <dblosevn> how bout some html
[03:38:52] <cuddle`> inside of the mouseenter
[03:38:56] <dblosevn> even it it doesnt work it helps to see the structure
[03:38:58] <cuddle`> but I can't seem to get that to work either
[03:39:42] <dblosevn> cuddle`: also selecting jquery instead of mootools seems to help jquery code work a bit better :-)
[03:39:58] <cuddle`> no this isn't the demo, I couldn't get the demo to work
[03:40:07] <dblosevn> oh ok was gonna say lol
[03:40:09] <cuddle`> I just pasted in jsfiddle because of the tidy function
[03:40:16] <dblosevn> where is this for loop
[03:40:28] <dblosevn> in setup?
[03:40:29] <cuddle`> in setup()
[03:40:30] <cuddle`> yes
[03:40:40] <rightnow|work> <div class="btn"><span><span class="icon"></span></span></div>   can i reach icon like this? $('.btn .icon').addClass ?
[03:40:41] <cuddle`> do you know how I should change those functions to return the proper functions?
[03:40:51] <cuddle`> in mouseenter()
[03:41:20] <dblosevn> rightnow|work: that should work just fine
[03:41:44] <rightnow|work> ok trying again!
[03:42:09] <rightnow|work> dblosevn, must have been a typo, worked now! thanks
[03:42:21] <dblosevn> rightnow|work: np
[03:43:40] <niels__> I'm adding items to a cart with Ajax, everything works perfectly fine unless the string of the item's name include special characters, such as 'æ, ø, å and 9,5/12', i've included both the jquery and model in this pastebin: http://pastebin.com/r4FsPKNs how and where should I handle encoding of the string, if that's what troubling it? :)
[03:44:06] <dblosevn> cuddle`: still trying to read your code but it seems this item[0] should be item[i]
[03:44:46] <dblosevn> cuddle`: sorry didnt see this line var item = this.menuItems[i];
[03:44:54] <cuddle`> the problem is those mouse enters are always triggering the last in the loop
[03:45:39] <cuddle`> all of the mouse enters created evaluate to the last made
[03:46:07] <cuddle`> I read somewhere I should return a function inside of the mouse enter() to enclose the functions, but I can't seem to get that to work at all
[03:46:49] <dblosevn> cuddle`: ya its kind of a waste to attach the events in a loop like that as attaching the events after the fact does the same thing
[03:48:39] <dblosevn> cuddle`: also, you cannot add #main-color > ul.menu > li.expanded a%s as a class as that is not a class thats a selector
[03:50:20] <dblosevn> cuddle`: eg... self._addClass(item, selectorToTab); wont work
[03:50:56] <cuddle`> oh thats a function I made inside the object :S
[03:51:45] <dblosevn> cuddle`: I see that now, horrible lol, id never use jquery medhtod names inside of my plugin even if they are prefixed creates confusion
[03:52:40] <cuddle`> I'll remember that
[03:53:08] <cuddle`> I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to get those mouse enters to evaluate at initialization and not whenever
[03:53:14] <cuddle`> they are triggered
[03:53:27] <cuddle`> sort of like doing an addEventListener() in actionscript
[03:53:45] <cuddle`> I tried .on('mousenter') but it has the same effect
[03:54:11] <cuddle`> I also tried enclosing the contents of the mouse enter in a 'return function(){}'
[03:54:23] <cuddle`> but that just stops it from executing for some reason
[03:54:24] <cuddle`> :S
[03:54:40] <dblosevn> cuddle`: i think i see what your tryiing to do, give me a couple more mins
[03:54:45] <cuddle`> thank you :)
[03:55:39] <milligan> Cork, is it possible to return a value in a callback .. ie function getValue() { $.get("/Servlet", function(result){ return result; })} ?
[03:57:26] <Drager> Any idea how you should open spoilers in forums? It can be alot of spoilers per thread.
[03:57:49] <enbergj> via another callback, function getValue(callback) { $.get("/Servlet", function(result){ callback(result); })}
[03:58:25] <enbergj> so you can call it as getValue(function(result) { doSomething(result); }.bind(this));
[03:58:39] <jquery> hello, can you enable spoof for my new username.
[03:58:53] <jquery> and it is mnus
[03:59:24] <dblosevn> cuddle`: are you including more then one of these plugins on the same page?
[03:59:39] <cuddle`> no
[04:11:05] <mikecmpbll> how come this doesn't put the label text in, and how can I make it work? http://jsfiddle.net/EksjP/
[04:11:17] <mikecmpbll> trying to build some form elements on the fly
[04:13:52] <aqeel> hi room
[04:14:11] <mikecmpbll> nvm fixed.
[04:14:19] <R00tk3y> Okay
[04:14:33] <R00tk3y> So I have a selector $commentContainer = $parentLi.find('.posts-container'); which is a UL
[04:14:53] <R00tk3y> Now I want to get another selector which is the li inside of that commentContainer
[04:14:58] <R00tk3y> is there a way I can do it
[04:16:59] <aqeel> $commentContainer = $parentLi.find('.posts-container li');?
[04:17:43] <Suppa_Spic> does anyone know how to get compressed this correctly with the YUI compressor? https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-color/master/jquery.color.js
[04:17:55] <aqeel> $commentContainer = $parentLi.find('.posts-container,.posts-container li');
[04:18:01] <Suppa_Spic> I compress it but I get errors
[04:18:40] <Lucky--> uh. when did I miss the train, and the message that <input type="radio" name="role" value="Ad Operations / IT" ******/*****> is no longer needed?
[04:20:09] <karstenk1977_> Hello

[04:21:45] <mikecmpbll> me..
[04:21:58] <mikecmpbll> do I get a prize?
[04:22:48] <karstenk1977_> I´m searching for an other young european, who would like to start his business in germany
[04:23:10] <karstenk1977_> I would prefer a graphic designer
[04:24:57] <mikecmpbll> unorthodox recruitment strategy.
[04:25:11] <karstenk1977_> wanted to know how is the demand, to start own business for south european in germany
[04:25:11] <merlin1991> mikecmpbll: nah, I claim the price ;)
[04:25:22] <mikecmpbll> merlin1991: darn.
[04:26:43] <karstenk1977_> I know the salaries and the income in south europe are much less than in germany
[04:27:51] <karstenk1977_> do you know a good european job plattform?
[04:36:37] <konr_trab> !!!!!!
[04:37:10] <SomeoneWeird> Say I have <div><div>a</div><div>b</div></div> is there a generic way to delete the div with b in it?
[04:40:29] <seutje> SomeoneWeird:  $('div').filter(function() { return this.innerText === 'b'; }).remove(); // will prolly tweak when there's comments or shit in there
[04:40:39] <seutje> or see ?contains
[04:40:40] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[04:40:59] <SomeoneWeird> neat, thanks
[04:41:22] <dblosevn> $('div div').next().remove()
[04:41:59] <SomeoneWeird> not that exact example
[04:42:04] <SomeoneWeird> needed something more generic :)
[04:42:21] <dblosevn> lol well you did say to remove that node lol contains is what you want
[04:43:06] <dblosevn> #("div div:contains('b')").remove()
[04:43:12] <seutje> that sentence needs more lol
[04:43:38] <dblosevn> we all need more
[04:44:26] <SomeoneWeird> yeah I got it working, thanks
[04:44:46] <dblosevn> ive always wondered about the contains selector though it would seem it would be slow, and also wont work if theres other html nodes within
[04:45:37] <abletony84> Is sidebarPosition = $sidebar.offset().top + $sidebar.height(); the same as var $sidebar = $("#sidebar"); $sidebarPosition = $sidebar.offset().top, $sidebarPosition += $sidebar.height();?
[04:45:46] <seutje> it's actually not all that heavy: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L789
[04:45:58] <dblosevn> eg... <div><div><strong>First name:</strong></div></div> $("div div:contains('First name:'),remove(); wouldnt remove anything
[04:46:26] <dblosevn> as the textnode is a child of strong not div
[04:46:33] <seutje> by design
[04:47:06] <seutje> if u need that, u'd have to build ur own recursive filter function or do some map magic
[04:47:08] <abletony84> nm all under control
[04:48:05] <dblosevn> ya, ive never really needed that functionality, only saw the selector when i was  browsing the jquery selectors one day
[04:48:53] <dblosevn> the only thing i would think it would be useful for is maybe highlighting search terms used to get to a page
[04:50:26] <dblosevn> but that would definitely be slow something like $("*:contains('text')").wrap('<span class="highlight"/>'); on a large page i bet that would take forever lol
[04:53:00] <dblosevn> not to mention its case sensitive
[04:54:33] <DukeDrake> hi
[04:55:53] <DukeDrake> maybe I get something wrong .... but when I scroll down a page and click a link which returns the $("html").scrollTop() value ... it shouldn't be zero?
[04:58:40] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: I may be wrong but im pretty sure 'html'`s scrollTop will always be 0 as its always at the top of the page
[04:59:39] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: although doing $(this).scrollTop() in that same function will not be 0
[04:59:45] <DukeDrake> dblosevn: ... it's meant to return the amount of px scrolled within html, no?
[04:59:53] <DukeDrake> dblosevn: no
[04:59:58] <DukeDrake> http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[05:00:45] <DukeDrake> (anyway... I also tested "body", document, window and this ... all being '0'
[05:00:47] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: exactly as i just said,  Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. html cant move its always at the top so its scroll top is always 0
[05:02:25] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: you could do something like this to determine how far down the page a user has scrolled $(window).height() - $(this).scrollTop();
[05:02:44] <DukeDrake> it's 0 , as I said ...
[05:03:16] <DukeDrake> and actually scrollTop is the exact value a user has scrolled
[05:05:11] <DukeDrake> the Demo on the api page is not particulary helpful ...
[05:06:32] <alcuadrado> anyone using select2? I don't get why I need initSelection to use val()
[05:06:41] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: on the contrary scroll top is the value of the vertical scroll bar at the top of the first matched element
[05:07:24] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: html body and document are always located at the top of the page hence there scrolltop will always be 0
[05:09:42] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: as I mentioned earlier $(windows).height() = $(this).scrollTop() will give you the scroll position of the scrollbar
[05:10:03] <dblosevn> $(window).height not $(windows)
[05:10:53] <DukeDrake> ?!
[05:11:09] <DukeDrake> dblosevn: and as I mentioned, it doesn't work here, either way.
[05:11:23] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: takes the height of the window minus the scrollTop of the link they clicked
[05:11:30] <DukeDrake> ....
[05:11:50] <dblosevn> which should give you the scroll position in pixels
[05:13:02] <dblosevn> wait im wrong on that scrolltop is relative to window so thats 0
[05:14:03] <Saaether_> scrolltop on body  is not always 0
[05:14:05] <Saaether_> example http://jsfiddle.net/RDnBE/
[05:15:08] <dblosevn> ya i was wrong there but html is 0
[05:16:07] <dblosevn> html is always 0 body and document do return a scrolltop
[05:16:26] <DukeDrake> wahhhh
[05:16:39] <DukeDrake> Saaether_: it returns 0 here! -.-
[05:16:55] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: your broswer is broken
[05:17:01] <DukeDrake> guess so XD
[05:17:15] <Saaether_> ah.... in IE is does return 0 o.O
[05:17:26] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: it returns 240 for me on a 1920x1080 screen
[05:17:28] <DukeDrake> FF 17 =
[05:17:35] <DukeDrake> FF 17 ?
[05:17:40] <dblosevn> chrome
[05:17:51] <Saaether_> ya it works for me in chrome, but not IT
[05:17:54] <Saaether_> IE
[05:17:58] <DukeDrake> aha
[05:18:05] <DukeDrake> maybe it only works in chrome?
[05:18:38] <dblosevn> firefox, ie return 0
[05:18:49] <dblosevn> chrome, safari return an integer
[05:19:07] <dblosevn> 225 on safari, 240 on chrome
[05:20:20] <DukeDrake> guess what
[05:20:27] <DukeDrake> in FF it works with "html" :P
[05:21:16] <DukeDrake> dblosevn: I thought, html is always at top and thus returns 0?  :P
[05:21:30] <DukeDrake> doesn't work on my page though
[05:22:13] <dblosevn> firefox is a different anumal it does wat it wants to
[05:22:17] <dblosevn> *animal
[05:22:46] <dblosevn> they have kind of strayed from the specs and are kinda going all ie on us, i used to like firefox a lot more before the last couple years
[05:22:48] <DukeDrake> thanx for trying to correct me, although I was right ;)
[05:23:20] <dblosevn> it used to be if you deved for firefox it worked in everything but ie, not the case anymore
[05:23:37] <Saaether_> lol ok after some testing for IE you need to use scrollto on html
[05:23:39] <Saaether_> http://jsfiddle.net/RDnBE/1/
[05:24:19] <Shadow> erichynds: u there
[05:24:36] <dblosevn> Saaether_: ie10 returns 0
[05:24:44] <Saaether_> working for me on 9
[05:24:49] <Saaether_> =/
[05:25:02] <dblosevn> ie10 behaves a lot more like a real browser though
[05:25:03] <Saaether_> ok well scrollto suck id suggest just not using it heh
[05:25:32] <Saaether_> yes but the majority of the world isnt using IE 10 yet =)
[05:25:42] <dblosevn> not quite enough for me to use it as my browser though lmao
[05:25:56] <DukeDrake> just use $('html, body')
[05:26:31] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: not so much youll get 0, 240 or 240, 0
[05:26:40] <DukeDrake> >.>
[05:26:51] <DukeDrake> dblosevn: how long have you been doing jquery yet?
[05:27:11] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: going on 5 years
[05:27:17] <Saaether_> ok new solution! http://jsfiddle.net/RDnBE/3/
[05:27:18] <DukeDrake> http://jsfiddle.net/RDnBE/4/
[05:27:29] <DukeDrake> even newer! XD
[05:27:29] <Saaether_> body + html! lol
[05:27:47] <DukeDrake> dblosevn: see my link ... scroll down, click the link - works?
[05:28:05] <Saaether_> yours doesnt work in chrome
[05:28:12] <Saaether_> mine works in both
[05:28:26] <DukeDrake> ought to install chrome >.>
[05:28:39] <Saaether_> you really should, best browser for development
[05:29:03] <dblosevn> Saaether_: http://jsfiddle.net/RDnBE/3/ is perfect except for when a browser decies to have a value for both html and body on scrollTop
[05:29:19] <Saaether_> true lol
[05:30:29] <DukeDrake> http://jsfiddle.net/RDnBE/5/ works in chrome, yes?
[05:30:41] <dblosevn> Saaether_: http://jsfiddle.net/RDnBE/6/ solves that
[05:31:01] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: 260 in chrome
[05:31:07] <DukeDrake> so, there.
[05:31:11] <DukeDrake> works in ff too
[05:31:19] <DukeDrake> just use window then
[05:31:50] <dblosevn> DukeDrake: ff, chrome, safari, ie10
[05:32:11] <DukeDrake> great =)
[05:32:33] <DukeDrake> just need to find out now, why it doesn't work on my page at all >.>

[05:46:31] <ItsJustMe> okay .. I could answer in pm .. but does not matter :)
[05:46:37] <aqeel> how is your site coming along
[05:46:37] <ItsJustMe> <- also using webchat
[05:46:52] <ItsJustMe> The site is just fine! Thanks to you somehow :D
[05:47:13] <ItsJustMe> atm I am trying to create something like a .. don't really know .. texteditor?
[05:47:35] <ItsJustMe> you click on navigation and it shall load different documents, close the ones which no longer fit in, and so on
[05:47:43] <ItsJustMe> save every contents before closing
[05:47:52] <ItsJustMe> add inputs to divs when needed
[05:48:13] <aqeel> http://jqueryte.com/
[05:48:16] <ItsJustMe> good exercise i think
[05:48:23] <aqeel> there are so many text editors plugins
[05:48:48] <ItsJustMe> just don't know how to say it .. for example a portfolio of yours ..
[05:48:58] <ItsJustMe> you got "who am i", "my references", ...
[05:49:20] <ItsJustMe> now you click in navigation on "personal data" and it opens up all these things
[05:49:51] <ItsJustMe> if you change afterwards (click another link) to "references" it shall close all "personal-data-documents" and open another ones
[05:50:02] <ItsJustMe> but save all the p-data before closing it
[05:50:04] <aqeel> may i suggest you draw your flowchart, and have it brainstormed first
[05:50:06] <ItsJustMe> you know?
[05:50:29] <aqeel> do step by step...
[05:51:17] <ItsJustMe> have brainstormed what? :)
[05:51:26] <ItsJustMe> my brain is stormed by idea input :'D
[05:51:35] <ItsJustMe> need to get clear about how to do it ..
[05:51:35] <aqeel> haha
[05:51:49] <ItsJustMe> the "what" is clear, the "how" makes my life that hard
[05:52:41] <aqeel> get your entities, your key frame from where you will go to and fro, the links...
[05:53:23] <aqeel> if you know what .....than start from top down approach....first step what exactly is you needed
[05:55:58] <morfeo_81> hi there

[06:02:19] <Atomics> I try a $.each in a $.each and that doesn't work...
[06:02:20] <Atomics>  oOo = new Array();
[06:02:20] <Atomics>   OoO = new Array();

[06:02:20] <Atomics>   OoO['polp'] = 'plop';
[06:02:20] <Atomics>   oOo.push(OoO);

[06:02:24] <Atomics> function test(Arr) {
[06:02:26] <Atomics>   $.map(Arr, function(array, i) { //I tried $.each
[06:02:28] <Atomics>     console.log(array);
[06:02:30] <Atomics>     $.map(array, function(value, index) { //I tried $.each

[06:04:55] <R00tk3y> I have a question about json, is possible to do this $json_response['comments'][$i]['username']
[06:05:04] <R00tk3y> Where i = a number
[06:07:41] <aqeel> ItsJustMe: just forget it
[06:07:54] <aqeel> lets carry on with your stuff
[06:08:07] <ItsJustMe> you want to help me with that? :DD
[06:08:14] <aqeel> sure why not
[06:08:49] <ItsJustMe> because it will be much for you to explain all that to me?
[06:09:09] <aqeel> nothing is much or less, where knowledge counts
[06:09:27] <aqeel> knowledge knows no boundaries
[06:09:52] <aqeel> one learns from cradle to deathg
[06:09:55] <aqeel> death*
[06:10:53] <aqeel> not only me but everyone in this room will be glad to have helped in one way or the other
[06:12:16] <Hans_Henrik> aqeel: including trolls? :o
[06:12:37] <aqeel> well that depends if they want to help..
[06:12:51] <aqeel> trolls are also human after all\
[06:12:54] <Hans_Henrik> hmm they ususally just wants to piss people off
[06:14:00] <R00tk3y> Can I do this??? $json_response['comments'][$i]['username']
[06:14:21] <Eviltwin> Sure
[06:15:07] <R00tk3y> it doesnt work though
[06:15:21] <Eviltwin> How specific
[06:15:32] <R00tk3y> Well in the response
[06:15:40] <R00tk3y> There is no i which is replaced by
[06:15:41] <R00tk3y> number

[06:18:50] <seutje> just twitch out on hover?
[06:19:03] <Guest42404> русские буквы работают?)
[06:19:29] <AdamPDotty> da
[06:19:38] <seutje> lol, I was about to say the same thing
[06:22:33] <moura> still not getting it work after changing the syntax errors :\
[06:29:20] <se-lite> I followed the jquery getting started tutorial, but no graphics/icons seem to work on buttons etc. Something im forgetting? (I included js/css from jquery.com as in the example)
[06:30:57] <katsh> can i use regex when selecting elements?
[06:31:12] <katsh> like $('.hello*')
[06:31:52] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[06:31:54] <NodeX> try that
[06:32:01] <katsh> thanks
[06:32:04] <aqeel> http://www.theloveofcode.com/jquery/delayed/
[06:32:11] <aqeel> anyone herad about this
[06:32:46] <Saaether_> katsh if you want to use actual regex http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[06:32:56] <NodeX> why would you use it aqeel ?
[06:33:04] <katsh> Saaether_: thanks man
[06:33:19] <AntonKor> silly question: what does % mean in this
[06:33:20] <AntonKor> console.log( 4 - 10 % 2 - 0.5);
[06:33:23] <aqeel> not use it, am googling and come across
[06:33:31] <aqeel> care to share
[06:35:20] <Saaether_> AntonKor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation
[06:35:53] <AntonKor> i knew i seen/ used that in php, just first time runing into it injs
[06:38:17] <moura> how can i random between 0 and 1 integer ?
[06:40:00] <Saaether_> moura https://github.com/Stasonix/jQuery.Random
[06:40:25] <moura> ty
[06:46:08] <seutje> holy shit, somebody made a jQuery static wrapper around Math.random? lol
[06:46:19] <Saaether_> yup lol
[06:48:52] <wolfehr> is focus out not triggered when a select loses focus?
[06:49:14] <seutje> ?blur
[06:49:15] <bot-t> .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[06:49:49] <seutje> wolfehr: losing focus triggers blur (it's a bit wonky on some elements on IE though)
[06:50:13] <wolfehr> is focusout not a more appropriate event handler though?
[06:50:46] <seutje> focusout is the opposite of focusin, not the opposite of focus
[06:50:58] <seutje> they work slightly different
[06:51:12] <seutje> focusin/out bubble up, focus/blur doesn't
[06:51:19] <seutje> don't
[06:51:25] <seutje> geez, obviously friday
[06:51:35] <seutje> basic grammars are failing me
[06:51:47] <wolfehr> so with regards to a select, if that loses focus (by clicking away or whatever) should focusout be triggered?
[06:52:15] <seutje> "The focusout event is sent to an element when it, or any element inside of it, loses focus. This is distinct from the blur event in that it supports detecting the loss of focus from parent elements (in other words, it supports event bubbling)."
[06:52:57] <seutje> wolfehr: yeah, I guess, although I've never used focusout to detect it on the element itself
[06:53:01] <wolfehr> OK, so with options inside a select, would they be regarded as a different element if you were altering between them? Could get messy, so perhaps that's why it isn't supported?
[06:53:35] <abletony84> I got this jQuery slider at http://jsfiddle.net/fgQVY/4/ that's made up of #main => #main_inner => div. Anybody know why restructuring it to #main-wrapper => ul#main => li does *NOT* work? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/fgQVY/6/
[06:53:56] <seutje> well since blur fires on the select and not on the options (afaik), it would imply that focusout only fires on the select as well
[06:55:33] <seutje> wolfehr: seems to work as expected though: http://jsfiddle.net/nwszx/
[06:56:14] <seutje> wolfehr: prolly better example: http://jsfiddle.net/nwszx/1/
[06:56:59] <wolfehr> is that new syntax for the on()? Thought it had to be $(element).on(event, element, function(){})
[06:57:37] <seutje> both are supported, I just didn't see much point in delegating
[06:57:39] <seutje> BUT FINE!
[06:58:07] <seutje> hm wait
[06:58:16] <seutje> when delegating, blur doesn't work anymore lol
[06:58:29] <seutje> ->http://jsfiddle.net/nwszx/2/
[06:58:49] <seutje> ah, has to be a map nowadays
[06:58:51] <seutje> ma b
[06:59:15] <seutje> hm no wait, doesn't have to be
[06:59:17] <seutje> odd
[06:59:39] <seutje> now it seems like focusout just fires twice
[07:00:42] <wolfehr> perhaps because option and selec those focus so it bubbles?
[07:00:53] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:01:04] <wolfehr> or maybe because you've got focus out and blur handled, so it's just triggering twice
[07:01:15] <seutje> interesting
[07:01:29] <seutje> wolfehr: yeah, I would expect it to
[07:01:34] <seutje> but I'm logging the event type
[07:01:50] <seutje> and for the blur handler, it's still reporting it as type focusout
[07:02:41] <wolfehr> ah, yeah, I read about that, isn't blur mapped to focus out?
[07:02:51] <wolfehr> from 1.5 or something?
[07:03:01] <seutje> oh
[07:03:34] <seutje> aaah, of course
[07:03:39] <wolfehr> there we go, from 1.4.2 blur is mapped to focusout because the blur event doesn't bubble in IE
[07:03:39] <seutje> blur doesn't bubble in IE
[07:03:51] <seutje> so it wouldn't be able to delegate without mapping it to focusout
[07:04:05] <seutje> I see, thanks :P
[07:04:26] <seutje> I gotta stop using Drupal with OldQuery
[07:06:01] <wolfehr> mmm, never had much fun with any of the off the shelf frameworks, always end up tied in to someone else's idea of good practice (which I'm sure for them it is, but never often is as good as it could be)
[07:08:14] <Cheema> Hey :)
[07:08:31] <Cheema> I'm using the jquery plugin cluetip: http://plugins.learningjquery.com/cluetip/#getting-started . It works fine but I'm trying to load data through a .getJSON call and then execute the piece of code that creates the tooltip
[07:08:32] <Cheema> but I can't seem to get the .js file that creates the tooltip to execute after the .json
[07:08:59] <Cheema> already asked in #javascript and they recommended that I come here :P
[07:09:55] <wolfehr> Cheema, do you have an example of the json data being returned and the success handler that processes that?
[07:10:03] <Cheema> yep
[07:10:08] <Cheema> I'll pastebin it
[07:10:10] <Cheema> one sec
[07:11:10] <Cheema> http://pastebin.com/sVHt3cFm
[07:11:18] <Cheema> that's the json code
[07:11:28] <Cheema> btw, the json works fine
[07:11:34] <Cheema> the data is valid
[07:11:42] <Cheema> it all renders correctly
[07:11:52] <Cheema> except I can't get the .js file to execute after it has all rendered
[07:13:07] <wolfehr> which .js file are you referring to?
[07:13:26] <wolfehr> it should automatically be executed (if there aren't any errors)
[07:13:35] <wolfehr> or parsed rather
[07:13:35] <Cheema> sec
[07:13:38] <Cheema> I'll pastebin whole code
[07:14:08] <wolfehr> if you've got code that doesn't execute, are you sure you don't have any errors in console (or are running in a browser that doesn't support console.log for example)
[07:14:28] <Cheema> I'm using firebug
[07:14:29] <Cheema> no errors
[07:14:34] <Cheema> and there isn't code that doesn't execute
[07:14:38] <Cheema> it just executes too quickly
[07:14:39] <Cheema> http://pastebin.com/5saqYJmW
[07:14:59] <Cheema> see at the bottom, the code: <script src="tooltip/createTooltip.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[07:15:13] <Cheema> I want that .js file to execute AFTER the json
[07:15:31] <enderx86> How would I go about encoding a JSON {"array": [1,2,3,4,5]} given the value of a textarea, i.e. $('textarea').val()?
[07:15:49] <Cheema> I tried document.write("tooltip/createTooltip.js");
[07:15:54] <Cheema> doesn't work
[07:15:55] <fonko> hi guys, wich is the AND simbol? && or || ?
[07:15:58] <enderx86> Supposing that the textarea's value is a list, e.g. 1,2,3,4,5
[07:16:34] <Cheema> any idea, wolfehr ? :/
[07:17:34] <wolfehr> Cheema, $.getJSON is async, so execute the code you want after the processing at the end of the success
[07:17:51] <Cheema> how?
[07:18:16] <Cheema> I tried document.write('<script src="tooltip/createTooltip.js" type="text/javascript"></script>'); at the end of the sucess
[07:18:25] <Cheema> didn't work..
[07:18:47] <wolfehr> why are you including a js file for that, can't you wrap whatever needs to be done in a function and execute it at the end of your success?
[07:19:13] <Rushing> is there a primary OO class that most people use?
[07:19:35] <Cheema> good idea :)
[07:20:22] <horrror> guys i want to create menu like this one http://www.thelincolnmovie.com/?videos
[07:20:29] <horrror> where u click and the content changes
[07:20:30] <wolfehr> Rushing, what do you mean? You can create OO code with javascript if that's what you mean (although not in as nice a way with other languages)
[07:20:31] <moura> http://jsfiddle.net/dRCDB/ -> can u guys help me out putting the bird flying from one side to the other then disappear if not shooted then another random bird from Y pos shows up and after 5 they stop appearing?
[07:20:33] <aqeel> fonko: && and !! or
[07:20:42] <aqeel> ||
[07:20:46] <aqeel> lol or
[07:20:47] <horrror> does anybody know a good plugin for that?
[07:21:20] <Rushing> there are mini frameworks for creating classes, like Dean Edwards Base.js, which i've used and like, but am just wondering if there's something else that a lot of query devs use
[07:21:27] <Rushing> i.e. http://v3.javascriptmvc.com/docs/jQuery.Class.html#&who=jQuery.Class
[07:22:08] <wolfehr> moura: take a look at http://spritely.net much nicer animation plugin that is cross browser compatible
[07:22:38] <abletony84> horrror: wow
[07:22:54] <Cook13> hey guys I'm considering using JQueryMobile for my next Android Project
[07:22:54] <Cook13> Do graphical transitions work smoothly?
[07:22:54] <Cook13> I'd like to program my own app with mobile Websites in a WebView container.
[07:23:01] <horrror> abletony84: ?
[07:23:19] <abletony84> horrror: thanks for the heads up that looks like a nice movie
[07:23:23] <wolfehr> Cook13: Go native, "web apps" aren't a shade on native
[07:23:34] <horrror> abletony84: yea. and a beautiful web
[07:23:45] <abletony84> yup
[07:24:27] <moura> wolfehr ty, going to test it
[07:24:43] <Cook13> wolfehr what do you mean by shade?
[07:24:50] <abletony84> horrror: i guess you could animate jquery ui's easing plugin to get that hover effect
[07:24:55] <wolfehr> bah…. I don't get why people do that whole "web app" thing… If you need to build something for a particular platform, use the best tool for the job, not the easiest tool you can use
[07:26:18] <Cook13> wolfehr I have to build an app that can be added with special moduls. So using Webtechnology was a good solution to my mind.
[07:26:40] <wolfehr> horrror: just animate each li on hover with either a left margin, or positive left position, then on hover out just remove that margin/left
[07:27:23] <wolfehr> horrror: notice they haven't death with event queuing, as if you rapidly move up and down over the elements, they keep going back and forth
[07:27:48] <horrror> wolfehr: I meant the content changing function
[07:27:52] <wolfehr> Cook13: If you're building an app for android, build an app for android, not a website
[07:28:47] <wolfehr> horror: bit more involved, but simple animations, break it down piece by piece and create an animation queue (or chain the animations in each completion if appropriate)
[07:29:48] <halcyon1234> jquery-mobile: Is there an equiv of the jqueryui ".ui-helper-hidden-accessible" in jqm?
[07:32:46] <horrror> is there a sleep function between animations?
[07:33:55] <aqeel> horrror: sleeps horrror ...three you go
[07:34:06] <aqeel> there*
[07:34:15] <aqeel> hehe
[07:35:32] <aqeel> all available stuff.... horrror http://jqapi.ru/
[07:37:41] <wolfehr> horrror: delay()
[07:37:52] <horrror> thanks
[07:38:39] <aqeel> i am kinda stuck on delay() myself
[07:39:49] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/TsxCJ/
[07:40:17] <aqeel> autoscroll("pause").delay(t).autoscroll("resume");
[07:40:30] <aqeel> if i [ut delay(5000)...it works
[07:40:40] <aqeel> but as per now code it wont work
[07:41:13] <aqeel> so anyone who wants to help
[07:45:28] <nFFF> why dont you want to use delay(5000) ?
[07:46:00] <aqeel> because it will be given dynamically
[07:46:09] <aqeel> can chage later
[07:46:17] <BillCriswell> delay( delay )
[07:46:20] <aqeel> externally
[07:46:38] <aqeel> not setting to be hard default...
[07:46:53] <nFFF> your passing delay in as an argument?
[07:46:59] <nFFF> and it doesnt work?
[07:47:26] <aqeel> as of now it is not working
[07:47:48] <aqeel> and if i put 5000 in delay: part works
[07:48:39] <nFFF> and t contains a valid value
[07:48:40] <nFFF> ?
[07:48:46] <nFFF> log t right before the line
[07:49:08] <aqeel> so the user can choose how long the delay will occur, i am thinking of from 15 sec to 7800 sec, interval of 15
[07:49:44] <nFFF> Why isn't the code working?
[07:49:52] <nFFF> It must be becuase t is empty
[07:53:13] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/test/Demo.aautoscroll.htm
[07:54:40] <BillCriswell> aqeel: You killed me browser.
[07:55:14] <aqeel> huh??
[07:55:18] <aqeel> $.fn.autoscroll.defaults = { settings: { step: 50, scroll: true, direction: "down", pauseOnHover: true }, delay: 5000, ffrw: { speed: "fast", step: 100} };
[07:55:33] <aqeel> have already specified...???
[07:58:09] <aqeel> i am trying tohave this line into delay()...$(this).oneTime(t || $.fn.autoscroll.defaults.delay, k, function () {$(this).autoscroll("resume");});
[07:58:33] <aqeel> instead of oneTime() makeing use of delay()
[08:00:33] <djuggler> So $.browser is deprecated. How do we tell if IE is in compatibility mode or not nowadays?
[08:01:51] <aqeel> djuggler: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9599744/ie-version-detect-using-jquery-in-compatibility-mode

[08:12:10] <mandarks> 		$(this).addClass('click-me');
[08:12:12] <mandarks> 	});
[08:12:14] <mandarks> so the class has been added everywhere, i remove it from places where its not needed like html, head, scripts elements etc..
[08:12:15] <mandarks> now the issue is whenever i try to click an element with:
[08:12:17] <mandarks> 	
[08:12:19] <mandarks> 	$("click-me").click(function(ev){
[08:12:20] <mandarks> 		console.log($(this).attr('id'));
[08:12:22] <mandarks> 	});
[08:12:23] <mandarks> to target that element, nothings happening..
[08:12:25] <mandarks> Why??
[08:12:49] <djuggler> You mean $(".click-me").click(function(ev){ right?
[08:12:56] <mandarks> no ev
[08:12:57] <mandarks> soz
[08:13:23] <djuggler> $("#id")      $(".class")
[08:13:35] <mandarks> its a class
[08:13:42] <djuggler> right, you left off the period
[08:13:52] <djuggler> $("element")
[08:13:59] <mandarks> soz, i just done a simple mock up of my actual problem
[08:14:03] <mandarks> i must hav missed it
[08:14:08] <djuggler> just checking
[08:14:15] <djQuery_> they still havent brought back the plugins site?
[08:14:27] <aqeel> and might never will
[08:14:49] <aqeel> to much spam to handle and maintain..
[08:15:04] <aqeel> that is why choosen github by many developers
[08:16:02] <mpholt> Hi, I'm trying to select a <th> element by class, and the element is in a 4th-level nested table. Am I able to just specify $(.classNameOfTH)
[08:16:04] <mpholt> whoops
[08:16:19] <aqeel> sure y not
[08:16:25] <mpholt> Hi, I'm trying to select a <th> element by class, and the element is in a 4th-level nested table. Am I able to just specify $('th.classNameOfTH') to retrieve all instances of the th element of that class?
[08:16:33] <aqeel> that is if no one else if having that class
[08:17:13] <mpholt> hmm.. that's what I'm trying but it's returning 0 elements even though 6 exist
[08:17:54] <aqeel> any typo error
[08:18:34] <fission6> anyone have experience writing a small embeddable script? i have content for a person on my website. i would like to be able to seemlessly let that user render "their" content on their web page via embedding a js snippet. any ideas, best practices, etc.
[08:18:56] <mpholt> aqeel: nah unfortunately
[08:19:25] <aqeel> what are you retrieveing and how, might provide your line of code
[08:19:25] <mandarks> djuggler: have  you managed to recreate the issue?
[08:19:47] <djuggler> which issue?
[08:20:14] <mandarks> the click event not happening
[08:20:55] <fission6> i'd also appreciate any advice on what to even google for this kind of thing
[08:21:17] <NoiseEee> mpholt: http://jsfiddle.net/B2SQD/
[08:21:33] <djuggler> sorry I didn't try.  If I had to wager a guess, you need to use .live instead of .click  since you are dynamically adding classes to the elements.  Try this: $("click-me").live("click",function(ev){  instead of $("click-me").click(function(ev){
[08:21:51] <NoiseEee> use .on(), not .live
[08:22:04] <aqeel> fission6: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-oembed/
[08:22:06] <mandarks> i tried .on already, no joy
[08:22:08] <djuggler> whoops. That's right. I forgot we'd swtichedd to .on
[08:22:32] <aqeel> may be used wrongly
[08:22:40] <NoiseEee> $(parentElement).on('click','selector',function(){}) @ mandarks
[08:24:47] <mandarks> maybe i did use it wrony
[08:24:57] <fission6> aqeel: this is interesting so whats this oem? have you every wrote anything related to doing this kind of stuff?
[08:25:17] <aqeel> sorry nope, googled for you
[08:25:54] <mpholt> aqeel: NoiseEee, ahh ok hmm maybe something on my page is malformed, will see if i can narrow it down any further... thanks both
[08:26:16] <aqeel> you are welcome
[08:27:17] <mandarks> NoiseEee: $(parentElement).on('click','.click-me',function(){}).. what is the parent element needed for? I only ask because as its dynamically inserting the .click-me class, i wont dont actually know the parent class.
[08:27:19] <fission6> this is interesting stuff but i think what i am doing is a little more fundemental, just providing a user with a snippet to render a widget with some content from another site
[08:28:04] <aqeel> parent element if in doubt use body
[08:28:33] <mandarks> I just tried that
[08:28:36] <mandarks> no joy
[08:28:39] <fission6> http://alexmarandon.com/articles/web_widget_jquery/ <- this looks decent
[08:28:41] <jrodl3r> http://gizoogle.net/index.php?search=netflix.com&se=Gizoogle+Dis+Shiznit
[08:28:55] <aqeel> the container into which content is called is actually to be provided , if unknown use wildcard, window,document, body
[08:29:10] <aqeel> best practice for on is to use body
[08:31:39] <mandarks> aqueel, it works.. the only thing is im getting a rediculous amount of click events.. probably because the selector can be found all the way down the dom.. any idea>
[08:31:43] <aqeel> mandarks: got sample code?
[08:31:44] <mandarks> ?
[08:31:48] <mandarks> sure
[08:33:00] <mandarks> 1sec
[08:33:10] <nerk> fission6: older widgets were based on document.write()
[08:33:27] <nerk> since ajax can be done cross domain, that would be another way to inject remote content into a site via js
[08:35:28] <HarryPitfall> ajax by default is denied for cross domain
[08:35:49] <HarryPitfall> all browsers that I know don't like it much
[08:35:56] <fission6> i think he meant jsonp
[08:36:11] <fission6> i am finding some decent stuff now on distrbuited js widgets
[08:36:22] <fission6> but would love to talk to anyeone who's built one
[08:37:01] <HarryPitfall> if you have a callback=? on url, $.ajax auto-magic knows that is jsonp
[08:38:15] <cirenyc> I am trying to understand jquery.when.  I want to make an ajax call with getJSON that once retrieved, performs an action.

[08:38:52] <cirenyc> If I console.log the param in the .then( ), I get the function definition, not the data.
[08:39:10] <cirenyc> djQuery_: okay, I'll read that.  Thanks.

[08:46:23] <aqeel> has()

[08:47:32] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/has/
[08:48:01] <fatguylaughing> aqeel: Hrmm, Since the html is dynamically generated and that ID could be anywhere how would I just for any element that has blah

[08:48:29] <fatguylaughing> aqeel: Thanks a bunch
[08:48:55] <royalty> alternatively if you put the jquery in the footer without wrapping it in onready it might work
[08:49:00] <barryhjames> I have an autocomplete field that isn't working.  When I look at the code, it is saying that autocomplete=off.  How do I change that to on?  I can see when I start typing it adds a class called "ui-autocomplete-loading," but nothing ever shows up.
[08:49:29] <Croves> Hello. How do I get the values from a cell in a table? I'm doing this: $('#month tbody tr td').each(function() { console.log( $(this).val() ); });
[08:49:35] <Croves> But all I get is an empty string
[08:49:41] <Croves> The table is a calendar
[08:50:30] <shoky> Croves: .text()  not .val()
[08:50:46] <royalty> when I am in jsfiddle
[08:50:47] <shoky> <td>s are not input elements with a value
[08:50:50] <Croves> Oh shoky, you are right!
[08:51:02] <Croves> Thank you, sir. I'm newbie in jQuery :P
[08:51:05] <Croves> Thank you very much!
[08:51:09] <royalty> and I set an element to a value how do I check the value of the element? liek which element it is pointing to?
[08:51:11] <shoky> np
[08:51:15] <royalty> would help me tons in debugging
[08:51:34] <shoky> royalty: what do you mean.. show an example fiddle
[08:51:59] <royalty> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/uFQvJ/14/ I want to see what toShow is pointing to
[08:52:13] <royalty> shoky: which element it is pointing to
[08:52:15] <shoky> toShow is not pointing to anything, it's a boolean
[08:52:23] <shoky> the return value of .hasClass()
[08:52:26] <royalty> oh
[08:52:37] <royalty> oops I thought it would return all elements with that class
[08:52:39] <royalty> oh
[08:52:56] <mandarks> aqeel: soz for the delay.. http://pastebin.com/K1pQP8Dk
[08:52:59] <shoky> no, that's $(".block-title-link.active");
[08:53:12] <royalty> I see that is a more efficient way of doing it
[08:53:13] <royalty> cool
[08:53:26] <shoky> or alternatively:  $(".block-title-link").filter(".active")
[08:54:14] <firstclassfunc> is there a disadvantage to doing function Test() { _.each(['getA', 'getB', 'getC'], function(fn) { Test.prototype[fn] = function(){...} } );  -- instead of declaring each as Test.prototype.getA = ..
[08:54:25] <royalty> that doesn't help in this case because I need to get the next few elements relative to .block-title-link-active but I don't think I actually have qualms with using next() or previous()
[08:54:36] <shoky> royalty: and to see what a jq object is "pointing to" you can console.log it

[08:54:38] <bot-t> royalty, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:55:40] <wiremaster> hey all
[08:55:40] <shoky> firstclassfunc: i dont see any disadvantage..
[08:56:11] <wiremaster> I'm using jquery ui autocomplete
[08:56:23] <shoky> firstclassfunc: er wait. you're setting Test.prototype stuff inside the Test constructor..?
[08:56:27] <aqeel> mandarks: http://jsfiddle.net/GMEy6/
[08:56:34] <firstclassfunc> shoky: yes
[08:56:37] <royalty> shoky: like this? it doesn't seem to be working http://jsfiddle.net/uFQvJ/18/
[08:56:37] <wiremaster> Is there a built in way to send the 'name' property of a the input element that is autocompletized, along with the term?
[08:56:44] <aqeel> never try to use * in your javascripting.....bad practive
[08:56:45] <shoky> firstclassfunc: uhh that doesn't seem right
[08:56:51] <aqeel> practice
[08:57:02] <firstclassfunc> shoky: why not, it does work as intended
[08:57:23] <shoky> royalty: look in your console.. there's no method called 'inner'
[08:57:43] <aqeel> mandarks: never try to use * in your javascript unless extreme cases, bad practice
[08:57:52] <shoky> firstclassfunc: ok maybe i don't understand what the intention is
[08:58:13] <royalty> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/uFQvJ/20/ my console still isn't showing me anything!
[08:58:52] <royalty> shoky: does console work with jsfiddle?
[08:58:56] <firstclassfunc> shoky: I want to add a bunch of accessor functions like 'getA', 'getB', 'getC', ... , 'getZ' -- instead of manually writing all these functions, I want to programatically add them to the prototpe
[08:58:57] <donburks> wiremaster: Not directly, but it is possible.
[08:59:09] <shoky> royalty: i told you to console.log the jq object, not it's html()
[08:59:25] <wiremaster> I just did $.post(url, {data:request.term, field_name:$(this).attr('id')}, function (data) {
[08:59:28] <shoky> royalty: it did console.log the html.. it's just empty
[08:59:35] <royalty> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/uFQvJ/22/ what about this?
[08:59:35] <shoky> er sorry
[08:59:37] <donburks> wiremaster: Yep.
[08:59:39] <shoky> it's not empty
[08:59:44] <royalty> oh
[08:59:46] <wiremaster> but the POST array only seems to contain 'data' key
[08:59:59] <wiremaster> it's all I can see in Firebug, at any rate
[09:00:06] <shoky> royalty: did you look at the console..?
[09:00:15] <royalty> shoky: it never shows me anything!
[09:00:16] <donburks> wiremaster: Is this inside of your callback function for source?
[09:00:30] <shoky> royalty: what console are you looking at.. what browser?
[09:00:41] <wiremaster> yes, that's right donburks
[09:00:49] <royalty> shoky: I am using firefox with on mountain lion I open console with ctrl-option-k
[09:00:58] <mandarks> aqeel: much better, buts its still firing two evens .. i think relative from the placement of the body element and the clicked element
[09:01:04] <mandarks> *events
[09:01:07] <shoky> firstclassfunc: but why are you doing it inside the constructor? that will get executed every time you create a new Test object
[09:01:20] <donburks> wiremaster: And if you console.log($(this)) what does it tell you that it is?
[09:02:16] <wiremaster> tells me it's an object.. with 'element' key of value [input#zip.inline]
[09:02:35] <oghran> so I'm including jquerymobile, but for some reason the CSS doesn't work on my device or simulator, only in my desktop browser.
[09:02:37] <oghran> i have no idea why. :(
[09:02:54] <firstclassfunc> shoky: OK, that was also another question, thanks for confirming
[09:03:10] <royalty> shoky: alerts don't work on jsfiddle either? I just want to be able to print something out somehwere. I suppose I can just try printing stuff out to a test element...
[09:03:28] <shoky> royalty: i donno what you're doing.. use firebug or chrome
[09:03:42] <shoky> royalty: i see the html in the console in firefox console too
[09:03:50] <wiremaster> ah, okay, so I console logged $(this).attr('id') and that's undefined
[09:04:00] <shoky> royalty: and don't use alerts for debugging. and look at:
[09:04:01] <shoky> ?ftj
[09:04:01] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[09:04:55] <donburks> wiremaster: Does your input that you're attaching the autocomplete to have an ID?
[09:05:34] <wiremaster> yes, I am able to target it with jQuery UI using the ID "#zip"
[09:06:40] <aqeel> mandarks: http://jsfiddle.net/GMEy6/3/
[09:07:06] <xrdodrx> Is anyone here familiar with jmediaelement? I can't get the compiler.jar to work
[09:07:51] <aqeel> mandarks: you have two nested div and both gets the class attached and thus you have two times the alert....* is bad use of code....
[09:07:59] <wolfehr> how does focusin work with regards to checkboxes? Are they in focus when clicked, then immediately focusout called when you release the mouse button?
[09:08:00] <BillCriswell> wolfehr: It could be focused till something else was clicked.
[09:08:00] <barryhjames> I have an autocomplete field that isn't working.  When I look at the code, it is saying that autocomplete=off.  How do I change that to on?  I can see when I start typing it adds a class called "ui-autocomplete-loading," but nothing ever shows up.
[09:08:00] <NoiseEee> barryhjames: i dont think the autocomplete attribute of the tag has anything to do with jqueryui's autocomplete
[09:08:06] <wolfehr> BillCriswell, does clicking on it provide it with focus, or is this only ever assigned if tabbing through the form?
[09:08:29] <mandarks> so how would you say in the nested class.. i want to select the most nested of the elements?
[09:08:41] <BillCriswell> wolfehr: Clicking on it will give it focus till you tab away or click something else.
[09:09:16] <Teduardo> Hi. i'm using click to open a modal dialog but i dont want # to be appended to the address bar when they click on the link text, so I added: onclick="return false" to the <a> tag and now when you click on the link the link's text vanishes immediately.
[09:09:18] <barryhjames> NoiseEee: I didn't think so either, but it isn't working.  When I put the json straight into the source, it works fine, but when I link up my PHP script, it doesn't work.
[09:09:19] <royalty> is it possible to do a search for a value of another element after a certain element?
[09:09:32] <NoiseEee> barryhjames: and debugging leads you to where?
[09:09:35] <shoky> royalty: be more specific/clear
[09:10:16] <royalty> say you have $("foo") and you want to search for the first class with $("bar") but only if it appears after foo
[09:10:30] <shoky> what does 'after' mean?
[09:10:42] <shoky> is it a sibling of foo? is it inside foo?
[09:10:47] <royalty> the first $("bar") after foo
[09:10:50] <royalty> what if I am not sure?
[09:10:58] <NoiseEee> royalty: there's a world of difference between the two
[09:11:02] <shoky> then you should know your html/layout better

[09:16:22] <royalty> actually I think I thought of a way!
[09:16:28] <royalty> lets see though
[09:17:58] <royalty> but I kind of cheated in the logic because I know somehting about the structure of the html other ppl don't

[09:42:30] <anavarro> petersendidit: thak you so much for you answer
[09:43:15] <anavarro> petersendidit: I setted the option cache to true and it's woring for FF but not for chrome
[09:43:34] <anavarro> petersendidit: Do you know any bug related to this issue?
[09:43:55] <petersendidit> Nope,
[09:44:25] <anavarro> petersendidit: this is the version of chrome 23.0.1271.95 m
[09:44:40] <anavarro> petersendidit: Seem to be the lastest
[09:44:45] <petersendidit> The tabs cache is depricated in UI 1.9 and going away in UI 1.10
[09:45:05] <anavarro> petersendidit: ohhhh
[09:45:22] <petersendidit> What version of UI are you using?
[09:45:31] <anavarro> petersendidit: 1.9
[09:46:22] <petersendidit> as long as you don't have $.uiBackCompat = false in your code then cache should work
[09:46:55] <anavarro> petersendidit: I don't.
[09:46:57] <abraithwaite> Another question, whenever I try to use selectors in .prev(<selector>) it doesn't seem to return anything
[09:47:17] <abraithwaite> even for things as simple as $(link).prev('[type="hidden"]')
[09:47:39] <anavarro> petersendidit: As I told you, is woking fine in FF. This is what confuse me the most.
[09:47:54] <anavarro> petersendidit: Chrome has a different behaviour.
[09:48:43] <petersendidit> anavarro: if you can create a reduced testcase in jsfiddle.net showing your problem then submit a ticket
[09:49:08] <petersendidit> You also might check out: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/page/upgrade-guide/1.9.md#deprecated-ajaxoptions-and-cache-options-added-beforeload-event to learn more about the deprecated cache option
[09:49:51] <petersendidit> Sorry make that link: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-ajaxoptions-and-cache-options-added-beforeload-event
[09:50:31] <anavarro> petersendidit: Thanks for the link
[09:53:16] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: ayt?
[09:54:52] <anavarro> petersendidit: beforeLoad is not being called!!
[09:55:14] <abraithwaite> Would someone mind explaining this bit of console to me? http://pastebin.com/KbXN6EwX
[09:55:26] <abraithwaite> I would expect .prev( to return something in that function
[09:55:33] <abraithwaite> err, in that snippet
[09:55:57] <NoiseEee> abraithwaite: prev/next work literally only on the previous/next element, not further siblings
[09:57:17] <NoiseEee> tbh i don't really understand it / why one would use a selector
[09:57:18] <abraithwaite> oh, so if the previous doesn't match the selector then it returns none?
[09:57:28] <abraithwaite> I thought it would return the previous matching the selector
[09:57:47] <abraithwaite> that is silly
[09:57:51] <abraithwaite> thanks!
[09:57:54] <NoiseEee> np
[10:12:27] <ed4208> I'm having a $.mobile.changePage problem with query mobile, can anyone give me some thoughts?
[10:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: I am now.
[10:21:12] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: I have a question about _on()
[10:21:27] <sgharms> After $("#foo").menu(), say
[10:21:41] <sgharms> is there any way to use _on to bind behavior?
[10:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what you mean.
[10:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> Can you provide more context/
[10:22:46] <sgharms> 1m.
[10:23:36] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/menubar/ui/jquery.ui.menubar.js#L49-L83
[10:23:50] <sgharms> I want to remove the bind() call on ln 69
[10:24:39] <goddard> i have a bunch of stuff generated by an ajax call that has a class photoBoxDelete i have a click event on that class but it is never triggered
[10:25:01] <goddard> do i need to do something special when i generate something with an ajax call?
[10:25:09] <kborchers> ?on @ goddard
[10:25:09] <bot-t> goddard, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: this._on( this.items, { keydown: ... } );
[10:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> well, this.items.siblings( this.options.menuElement )
[10:27:17] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: let me check my code, because I thought it was doing that.....
[10:30:02] <katsh> does anyone know a good web based editor like tinymce?
[10:31:07] <goddard> kborchers: anything if im using jquery 1.5
[10:31:33] <kborchers> ?delegate @ goddard
[10:31:35] <bot-t> goddard, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:31:45] <goddard> thank you sir
[10:31:49] <kborchers> np
[10:31:53] <jim_m> hi all
[10:32:20] <kborchers> goddard: fyi, the better solution would be to upgrade jQuery though
[10:32:52] <jim_m> not sure if this is a JQuery issue or a CSS issue on Firefox, but this page shows blank in Firefox with no error but it shows fine in Chrome:  http://www.armomatch.com/mod/profile_manager/horoscope_window.php?women=capricorn&man=capricorn
[10:33:29] <jim_m> any idea what's wrong?
[10:33:44] <kborchers> jim_m: works for me in FF
[10:33:51] <jim_m> odd
[10:33:54] <jim_m> I'm on a mac
[10:34:07] <kborchers> me too on FF 16
[10:34:25] <jim_m> yep me too 16.0.2
[10:34:42] <jim_m> maybe it's just something on my end then, thank you
[10:34:51] <camwest> Hey folks. I'm having some problems sequencing two functions. They both return promises. The first function takes no arguments, it does an ASYNC operation and the promise resolves with some data which I need to pass to the second function. Once the second function's promise resolves I have to do some more work. I was using $.when(func1).then(func2).done(function(results) {}); except results is a promise object instead of the data passed to my func2 deferre
[10:34:51] <camwest> resolve callback. Any ideas how to do this properly?
[10:39:43] <goddard> kborchers: can you have a look at this it still doesn't seem to want to work http://jsfiddle.net/3eRAb/
[10:40:26] <Saaether_> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'delegate' of null
[10:41:36] <goddard> sorry here http://jsfiddle.net/3eRAb/1/
[10:41:46] <therealkoopa> If you have a large div that is set to overflow:auto and you have scrollbas both right and bottom. is it possible to get the total size of everything inside the div?
[10:43:29] <anew> what do you guys think of the laZy load plugin ?
[10:44:17] <goddard> this works on jsfiddle but not my site jquery 1.5 http://jsfiddle.net/3eRAb/4/
[10:47:00] <Saaether_> goddard how about this? http://jsfiddle.net/3eRAb/5/
[10:48:49] <goddard> Saaether_: kick arse that did it
[10:49:08] <goddard> thanks
[10:49:17] <Saaether_> np
[10:51:47] <anavarro> Can you please try this and tell me if this is a bug or not? http://pastebin.com/9kAKafpz
[10:52:07] <anavarro> Chrome is reloading tabs always...
[10:54:49] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the tip.  That worked.
[10:55:00] <Saaether> looking at the API for tabs http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/ i dont see a cache option
[10:55:05] <Saaether> anavarro
[10:56:14] <anavarro> Saaether: Well. It's deprecated now, but should be working.
[10:56:51] <anavarro> Saaether: Could you test the code in jsfiddle.net
[10:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> anavarro: Did the same code work in 1.8.x?
[10:58:43] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: Let me try.
[10:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, anavarro: There are no remote tabs to cache.
[10:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> All of the tabs in http://pastebin.com/9kAKafpz are local.
[11:00:06] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: What do you mean with local?
[11:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> The tab content is on the page.
[11:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> All the tabs point to existing content.
[11:00:32] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: Well yes and no
[11:00:59] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: The have object elements pointing to remote pages.
[11:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't matter.
[11:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing the tabs widget looks at is what the anchors point to.
[11:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> The cache option is not about content inside the panel.
[11:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's about the panel itself.
[11:02:08] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: And why is it working on FF?
[11:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> Because different rendering engines have different behavior for toggling the display of objects
[11:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> This has nothing to do with the tabs widget.
[11:03:24] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: Fine. How would you fix this issue?
[11:03:37] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: Would you help me?
[11:04:13] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: Maybe avoiding to use object and pointing directly from the tag panel?
[11:04:33] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: How would that be?
[11:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> You'll have CORS issues.
[11:06:51] <barryhjames> NoiseEee: Having a problem with a UI Autocomplete.  I am using a PHP script as the source returning JSON.  When I type the JSON directly into source, it works fine, but when I import in from a PHP file, it stops working.  It's returning no errors, just not completing the autocomplete.
[11:07:29] <NoiseEee> barryhjames: sounds like your issue is PHP then?
[11:07:56] <barryhjames> NoiseEee: But when I echo the PHP script directly to the screen, it prints out perfect JSON.
[11:08:29] <NoiseEee> is it sending JSON appropriate headers?  can you paste sample code online?
[11:08:45] <NoiseEee> what does "When I type the JSON directly into source" mean barryhjames?
[11:09:10] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: What CORS means?

[11:14:59] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: Are you sure you can just provide source a string like that?
[11:15:37] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: So you think there is nothing to do with the tabs?
[11:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:15:46] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source Isn't that what it says here? Unless I am reading it wrong.
[11:15:57] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: ohh, great.
[11:15:59] <kborchers> Quix0te: fix your client please
[11:16:16] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: Maybe get rid of jquery tabs
[11:16:24] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: Thanks
[11:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> anavarro: It's not tabs that's causing the problem.
[11:16:38] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: No, you're right. Hmm... Are you sure it's not returning { data: "foo" } instead of [ { data: "foo" } ] ?
[11:16:56] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: Don't see the difference.
[11:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> Actually needs to be [ { "data": "foo" } ] (keys must be quoted)
[11:17:33] <BillCriswell> Yeah, sorry, I was focused on it being an array more though.
[11:17:53] <ronson> Does anyone know what's wrong with this jsperf? http://jsperf.com/conditionally-loading-jquery-plugins-based-on-dom
[11:17:59] <ronson> It's my first one

[11:18:11] <NoiseEee> barryhjames: im not an expert with the UI stuff, but i've always done autocomplete like http://jsfiddle.net/ZG9Jd/2/
[11:18:34] <barryhjames> BillCriswell, scott_gonzalez: What it is returning is ["Afghanistan","Central African Republic","South Africa"].  I am using the option that uses the array of strings.
[11:18:46] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: What is the meaning of a frame work if you cant protect developers from cross-broweing problems?
[11:19:13] <eddiemonge> the meaning is to make doing a lot of work simpler
[11:19:21] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: Set the content-type right?
[11:19:26] <NoiseEee> anavarro: cross-browser is not the same as cross-origin
[11:19:38] <BillCriswell> Unless it forces json.
[11:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> anavarro: I bet you the problem is as simple as elem.style.display = "none"; causing the problem. There's absolutely nothing we can do about that.
[11:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> anavarro: Plus, it's completely outside the view of the tabs widget, so there's no reason to expect tabs to handle that.
[11:21:02] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: Yes, JSON.
[11:21:29] <abraithwaite> Thanks again for your help NoiseEee!! Cheers :)
[11:22:09] <anavarro> scott_gonzalez: I can do that pefectly without jquery tabs, it's easier..thanks anyway
[11:22:25] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: Do you have what NoiseEee posted with the dataType: "json" option?
[11:22:25] <barryhjames> NoiseEee: Your solution didn't work, either.
[11:23:32] <barryhjames> BillCriswell: Yes, just added that in and it still doesn't work.  Updated jfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZG9Jd/3/

[11:33:12] <catcher> barryhjames, I'm late to the party, but are you returning json_encode($countriesArray) from countries.php?
[11:33:49] <barryhjames> catcher: Yes, I am.  NoiseEee: Sorry, still trying to find my way around in Chrome and find where I can view the XHR response.
[11:34:14] <tw2113> why firefox why? why can't you obey console.log??
[11:34:22] <NoiseEee> barryhjames: Network / click "XHR" on the bottom to restrict to XHR calls only
[11:35:00] <catcher> barryhjames, you can visit countries.php in a browser if you can't find the response.
[11:37:28] <enderx86> My $.ajax() call is going to the fail() callback instead of done(), even though I'm getting a 200 Status OK response, with the appropriate response data. Why is this?
[11:40:33] <barryhjames> catcher, NoiseEee: Got it working, thanks for your help!  Turns out that even though it was producing the right results without calling directly onto my PHP database connect, it still wanted that include in the PHP script.  Very weird, but whatever.  Thanks again!
[11:40:55] <NoiseEee> np good luck barryhjames
[11:41:14] <kamoricks> I'm getting "SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'parseJson'" on "$.parseJson(xdr.responseText);". Why? I'm using JQuery 1.7.2.
[11:41:37] <NoiseEee> its parseJSON kamoricks
[11:43:02] <kamoricks> Ah. Right. Thanks. (Sorry, been debugging IE9 for the last few hours.)
[11:43:09] <kamoricks> And now it works! Thanks.
[11:44:12] <wachpwnski> you can bind to ajaxSend, but which is that?
[11:44:36] <wachpwnski> What if you have multiple ajax requests going, it triggers for all of them, there is no way to determine which one?
[11:46:10] <catcher> wachpwnski, you can inspect $(this)
[11:46:33] <srj55> is there a way to build a selector for "not has ancestor .myclassname" ?
[11:46:56] <wachpwnski> but if you are binding to something like this: $('.throbber').bind('ajaxSend', function() { });
[11:48:24] <Scott0_> in php you can do $array[] = 'foo', how would I do this in javascript?
[11:48:38] <kamoricks> Scott0_: array.push('foo');
[11:48:44] <NoiseEee> Scott0_: array.push('foo');
[11:48:47] <NoiseEee> doh
[11:49:02] <wachpwnski> Scott0_:  array.push('foo');
[11:49:10] <wachpwnski> sorry, had to get in on the fun too.
[11:49:22] <royalty> Scott0:array.push('foo');
[11:49:38] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: $('something').ajaxSend($.bind(function() { },this));
[11:49:43] <catcher> wachpwnsk, use the params
[11:50:23] <wachpwnski> catcher:  what do you mean?
[11:50:45] <halcyon1234> @srj55: Look at .filter(function(index)).  if $(this).parents("whatever").length == 0...
[11:50:46] <catcher> Basically what NoiseEee said
[11:51:06] <Scott0_> Scott0_: array.push('foo');
[11:51:13] <Scott0_> oh wait a min....
[11:51:15] <Scott0_> :P
[11:51:38] <Scott0_> wish you guys would stop pushin me around....
[11:54:09] <wachpwnski> catcher, NoiseEee: I just don't get how a selector pins down a certain ajax request?
[11:54:41] <wachpwnski> oh wait i see
[11:55:01] <wachpwnski> $('something').ajaxSend($.bind(function() { },this)); <- it's the "this" part.
[11:56:40] <catcher> it IS the 'this' part :)
[11:56:43] <wachpwnski> if I do var ajx = $.ajax() can I just do $(ajx).ajaxSend() ?
[11:56:51] <NoiseEee> well actually according to the docs, you don't need to bind if as $('something') is "this" in ajaxSend
[11:57:14] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: ive lost what it is you're trying to achieve
[11:57:36] <catcher> Me too, I'm not clear on the binding within.
[11:58:44] <wachpwnski> I just want to change a certain div based on the ajax request. I can do that with .done() or .fail(), but how do i determine which ajax request finished if i use the ajaxSend ?
[11:59:58] <NoiseEee> what makes you think you need ajaxSend at all?
[12:00:02] <NoiseEee> do you know what it does?
[12:00:07] <TelFiRE> Is there a good flip plugin that does a legitimate flip? I find so many out there but the vast majority are extremely choppy, or they erase the content before doing the flip and then fade it back in which is not what I'm going for.
[12:00:18] <wachpwnski> Detects when a ajax request was sent right?
[12:00:35] <NoiseEee> sure but why wouldn't you just deal with 'which ajax request finished' in the callback?
[12:00:39] <wachpwnski> TelFiRE:  that is html5 stuff
[12:00:54] <TelFiRE> I'm looking for a jquery plugin
[12:01:15] <TelFiRE> I could do it with CSS3 but then it would not support IE except 10.
[12:01:29] <srj55> halcyon1234, got it...that worked!
[12:01:50] <wachpwnski> Chances are it will be choppy then.
[12:02:33] <wachpwnski> NoiseEee:  I think that is what I was just thinking. I am crazy somtetimes, always trying to do silly things. haha
[12:02:41] <TelFiRE> there's seriously no basic flip effect that works? I swear I've seen this for a lot longer than HTML5 has been around
[12:02:45] <woopwoop> <tr><td></td><td>something</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><input id="link" /></td></tr> how would I access the <td>something</td> from a .click listening on #link? $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').what else?
[12:03:31] <wachpwnski> Most confusing question ever.
[12:03:52] <donburks> woopwoop: Do you want the <tr> or the 'something'?
[12:04:01] <donburks> Or the <td>
[12:04:05] <NoiseEee> woopwoop: .... $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').find('td').contains('something')
[12:04:42] <NoiseEee> woopwoop: .... $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').find('td'):contains('something')
[12:05:03] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Sure about that second one?
[12:05:09] <BillCriswell> ;)
[12:05:11] <donburks> I was about to say.
[12:05:30] <NoiseEee> nope
[12:05:41] <woopwoop> hmm, how would I go about just finding that second td?
[12:06:03] <NoiseEee> woopwoop: .... $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').find('td:contains("something")')
[12:06:13] <woopwoop> something like $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').find('td'):eq(1).val()
[12:06:25] <woopwoop> basically i just need to get the html value within the second td
[12:06:27] <donburks> Not .val(). That's for inputs.
[12:06:27] <BillCriswell> selector :eq(2) or $blah.eq(2)
[12:06:28] <NoiseEee> woopwoop: well the .val() is pointless, <td>s don't have a val
[12:06:41] <woopwoop> or the content within that td
[12:06:42] <BillCriswell> .html() or .text()
[12:06:44] <halcyon1234> $("td").html()
[12:06:47] <donburks> woopwoop: .html() will give you the HTML inside a node. .text() will give you the text inside the node.
[12:07:30] <cjordan> Is this the appropriate channel for questions about jqueryUI?
[12:07:55] <BillCriswell> cjordan: There's a #jquery-ui I think, but it's still usually cool to ask in here.
[12:08:12] <donburks> It's not inappropriate.
[12:08:13] <cjordan> ah... I didn't try with a dash... I just tried #jqueryui...
[12:08:50] <cjordan> thanks guys. The problem I'm having is that when switching themes (from Redmond to one I rolled myself using the theme roller), my button icons stopped appearing.
[12:09:11] <donburks> cjordan: Check the path in your css file to where the icons are stored.
[12:09:17] <cjordan> now, at the same time I went from using jQuery 1.7.1 to 1.8.3
[12:09:38] <cjordan> ah... didn't think there might be a path issue... good suggestion.
[12:09:38] <donburks> Icons are purely a CSS issue.
[12:10:01] <donburks> I had the same problem once, it was a path issue.
[12:10:09] <cjordan> true, but I've got multiple issues dialogs don't appear correctly either.
[12:10:18] <woopwoop> thanks guys
[12:10:29] <cjordan> I'll bet you're right on the path issue. I can't believe I didn't think of that.
[12:10:55] <cjordan> let me check all the paths, and see how many problems that fixes.
[12:11:02] <cjordan> thanks donburks! :)
[12:11:10] <donburks> Np :)
[12:12:21] <anavarro> Scott0_: I owe you an apologize. I was frustrated with this crap. The problem was the the object element on chrome. I've changed it for iframes and worked fine.
[12:12:48] <Harmageddon> Hi everyone! I'd like to realize an accordion and a buttonset on my drupal site using jQuery UI. Is it possible to disable the default jQuery UI theming for the accordion only and enable it for the buttons? I can "kick" the jQuery UI css files out completely, but then my buttonset isn't styled either.
[12:13:32] <anavarro> Scott0_: I'll try to find why chrome is reloading the object content any time it becomes visible
[12:14:57] <ogk1000> how can I reset the interval timer on this little piece of code ? http://collabedit.com/swbxr
[12:14:58] <donburks> Harmageddon: The styling is done via CSS classes. When you init the accordion, it's going to add those classes to it to give it both function and form. I'd suggest overriding the theme properties in your site's CSS file.
[12:15:03] <TelFiRE> so is it even possible to change the width of something and have it "squish" without aspect ratio, as if it were all an imate
[12:15:04] <TelFiRE> image*
[12:15:30] <donburks> ogk1000: clearTimeout()
[12:15:38] <ogk1000> that clears all globals or?
[12:15:50] <ogk1000> do I need to single out the speed variable or rotate function?
[12:15:57] <donburks> ogk1000: That stops the setTimeout. clearInterval() will clear the setInterval()
[12:16:10] <ogk1000> but how does it know which to clear, or it just clears any?
[12:16:22] <cjordan> My problem with jqueryui icons doesn't appear to be a pathing issue...
[12:16:36] <donburks> ogk1000: clearTimeout(timeoutID)
[12:16:42] * Harmageddon would like a "no-style" option or something for accordions
[12:16:45] <donburks> ogk1000: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.clearTimeout
[12:16:46] <Harmageddon> :(
[12:16:55] <halcyon1234> cjodran: did you make sure to actually download the /images folder for the icons, copy the /images folder into the jqueryui css folder?
[12:17:15] <eddiemonge> Harmageddon: why?
[12:17:29] <ogk1000> donburks, timeout or invterval would be the same?
[12:17:55] <donburks> ogk1000: Well, you have both.
[12:17:56] <eddiemonge> ogk1000: they are similiar but different
[12:18:01] <ogk1000> can I just do something like clearInterval(rotate());
[12:18:02] <donburks> ogk1000: clearTimeout clears one set with setTimeout. clearInterval clears one set with setInterval.
[12:18:04] <cjordan> halycon1234, yep. I even verified with firebug that the image files are being loaded when the page loads.
[12:18:04] <Harmageddon> eddiemonge: for not having to override every single style property for my accordion
[12:19:40] <eddiemonge> Harmageddon: why dont you use a custom accordion at that point?
[12:19:56] <eddiemonge> you could also just not include the css theme
[12:20:09] <Harmageddon> eddiemonge: custom accordion?
[12:20:14] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: yo
[12:20:24] <someprimetime> thanks for the techliminal talk
[12:20:24] <halcyon1234> cjordan: Link to source?
[12:20:29] <Harmageddon> eddiemonge: yeah, but I'd like the other jQuery stuff to be styled
[12:20:36] <Harmageddon> it's only the accordion
[12:20:45] <someprimetime> even though i had to pee the whole time and didn't want to walk past the projector to get to the bathroom
[12:20:52] <Scott0_> anavarro: I think you have the wrong person
[12:20:52] <donburks> Harmageddon: custom needs = custom solution
[12:21:07] <Harmageddon> well, maybe I'll just create my own buttonset styling
[12:21:36] <anavarro> Scott0_: Ohh yes. I'm sorry
[12:21:51] <cjordan> halcyon1234: sorry. It's behind a firewall at my office. I just put the new theme files in place a little while ago, so I don't really have a publicly viewable example. :(
[12:22:09] <cjordan> I was just kind of hoping that this was a common problem when changing themes...
[12:22:27] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: hey. thanks
[12:22:54] <someprimetime> now get that plugin site done
[12:23:18] <halcyon1234> cjordan: it almost 100% means you put the files in the wrong place, or didn't include the right files in your page.
[12:24:29] <eddiemonge> Harmageddon: why specifically dont you like about the default styling?
[12:24:44] <enderx86> Question: does int[] autobox into Integer[] and vice versa?
[12:24:56] <someprimetime> Harmageddon: you could write your own accordion very easily
[12:24:58] <enderx86> Follow-up: Or... is autoboxing not true for arrays?
[12:25:07] <enderx86> sorry, wrong channel
[12:25:26] <Harmageddon> eddiemonge: It doesn't fit in my site. I'd like to leave the accordion just without style.
[12:25:40] <someprimetime> Harmageddon: that's the tradeoff of using a library
[12:25:46] <eddiemonge> Harmageddon: why dont you style it then?
[12:25:51] <Harmageddon> someprimetime: As I just said, I'll create my own buttonset now, also a solution ;)
[12:25:55] <someprimetime> +1
[12:26:32] <Harmageddon> [21:19] <Harmageddon> eddiemonge: for not having to override every single style property for my accordion
[12:26:55] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/nNDq9/9/ there's a shitty accordion plugin i wrote that you can customize if you want
[12:27:55] <eddiemonge> Harmageddon: so what are you looking for then? theres not a lot to style with it. you could also create your own accordion using a custom widget based off jQUI
[12:28:57] <cjordan> halcyon1234: hmm... in my directory sructure, I have a folder called 'redmond' which contains all the stuff needed for that theme. All I did was add a folder for my new theme, 'mytheme' which contains all of the necessary files for it. then in my page I include the new 'mytheme/...blah.custom.css' just like I did for redmond.
[12:29:30] <cjordan> If the paths were wrong, how would the browser even know where to go get the files? in firebug I can see the files being loaded successfully
[12:30:50] <cjordan> halcyon1234: I'm checking further... haven't given up on the path idea...
[12:31:05] <halcyon1234> cjordan: I can'
[12:31:35] <halcyon1234> * 't speak to "the files" you're loading, if they're correct, or completed, etc, since I can't see your folder structure or HTML. Sorry.
[12:32:38] <cjordan> halcyon1234: I know...
[12:34:37] <halcyon1234> cjordan: do a diff between /redmond and /customtheme, and look for orphans. I'm almost certain you forgot a file or a folder or something.
[12:34:50] <jobelenus> hey guys, quick question surrounding 'orientationchange' and jquery's base 'resize' -- when orientationchange fires does resize fire??? (experience from people seems to indicate yes, though I don't see this being fired from orientationchange)
[12:35:44] <eddiemonge> cjordan: whats the problem?
[12:38:07] <cjordan> eddiemonge: I switched from the 'redmond' theme to a theme that I rolled using the theme roller, and now icons are not showing up next to my buttons. There's a couple of other problems too (dialogs look horrible), but I'm just trying to fix the icon issue right now.
[12:38:37] <eddiemonge> cjordan: what path are you using for the images?
[12:39:06] <cjordan> It's the button widget I'm using I didn't set any of these paths.
[12:39:14] <ogk1000> sup eddiemonge
[12:39:15] <cjordan> the theme-roller set the path
[12:39:30] <ogk1000> eddiemonge, is a champ
[12:40:00] <cjordan> however, looking at the css file that the theme roller built for me, the paths are just like they are for the redmond theme images/<filename>
[12:40:57] <Scott0_> anyone use highcharts?
[12:41:09] <cjordan> I checked my theme and the default state of a clickable item should be using 3d3d3d as its color so the file would be 'images/ui-icons_3d3d3d_256x240.png' and I can see via firebug that this file is indeed being loaded properly
[12:41:39] <eddiemonge> cjordan: do you have an images folder in your themes folder
[12:41:50] <cjordan> eddiemonge: I do...
[12:42:05] <cjordan> and it contains all of the proper images...
[12:42:41] <eddiemonge> cjordan: can you zip up your web files for both themes and upload them somewhere we can see them?
[12:42:46] <s34n> jquery-mobile seems to be mucking around with my forms in a way that submits the form even when my submit handler returns false
[12:43:32] <cjordan> what files do you want?
[12:43:48] <eddiemonge> cjordan: them theme folders, and the file calling them
[12:44:25] <cjordan> also, I wouldn't know where to put them so you could get to them. I don't have a place online where just anybody can go and get things.
[12:44:44] <cjordan> I don't often have to share my files around
[12:44:45] <eddiemonge> cjordan: you dont have dropbox?
[12:44:50] <cjordan> I do not
[12:45:33] <jobelenus> hey guys, quick question surrounding 'orientationchange' and jquery's base 'resize' -- when orientationchange fires does resize fire??? (experience from people seems to indicate yes, though I don't see this being fired from orientationchange)
[12:45:41] <s34n> hmm.. data-ajax="false" on the form fixed the problem
[12:46:07] <Scott0_> anyone familiar with highcharts?
[12:47:32] <donburks> Scott0_: Yes. I've worked with it for a while.
[12:48:23] <Scott0_> donburks: http://jsfiddle.net/xGwK3/1/
[12:48:47] <Scott0_> donburks: the series line won't line up to the scale
[12:49:03] <Scott0_> values don't match up and im not sure what I did wrong here
[12:49:19] <eddiemonge> jobelenus: does this help: http://davidwalsh.name/orientation-change ?
[12:50:03] <Scott0_> donburks: I simplified it and put in the return(false) to break the .each so that could only show one series
[12:50:04] <jobelenus> eddiemonge: hrmm, a little, but not entirely...
[12:50:41] <Scott0_> donburks: if you can glance at that and see if anything jumps out at you I would appreciate it
[12:50:50] <eddiemonge> jobelenus: the issue isnt specific to jquery. its the window resize event you are looking at
[12:51:07] <donburks> Scott0_: I'm looking at it, nothing's jumping out immediately, but let me dig further.
[12:51:11] <Scott0_> thanks
[12:51:17] <jobelenus> eddiemonge: people on SO said that 'resize' is fired when 'orientationchange' is fired.. but weren't specific as to how/when that happens… after checking jqm source code, it isn't being fired manually
[12:51:31] <jobelenus> eddiemonge: i agree, it isn't specific -- but the people who know it would be here :0
[12:51:32] <jobelenus> :)
[12:52:16] <Scott0_> donburks: if you look in console you can see the series and yAxis output for debug
[12:52:38] <Scott0_> donburks: wait.. or not, I might have removed those :P
[12:52:48] <donburks> Scott0_: I'm voting for not. :P
[12:53:59] <Scott0_> donburks: there http://jsfiddle.net/xGwK3/3/
[12:54:11] <Scott0_> but im sure you are capable of suing console.log
[12:54:19] <Scott0_> *using
[12:54:20] <Scott0_> :D
[12:54:23] <eddiemonge> jobelenus: you could feature detect i think. although resize might be better to use
[12:54:27] <donburks> I've used it once or twice. *cough*
[12:54:48] <jobelenus> eddiemonge: not what im looking for… thanks though
[12:54:57] <eddiemonge> jobelenus: what are you asking then?
[12:55:19] <jobelenus> im asking if the resize event ALSO gets fired when orientationchange is fired
[12:55:24] <Scott0_> donburks: pm me if you happen to find anything please, im gonna go get some coffee
[12:58:32] <eddiemonge> jobelenus: have you tried it?
[12:59:05] <jobelenus> its more than "try it" since there is a browsers/os/version matrix to consider
[13:01:26] <eddiemonge> jobelenus: which are what?
[13:05:41] <katsh> So i use html() to grab the entire page's dom/content. I notice that it is slightly different when jquery gets it. For instance, <br />'s will be shown as <br>
[13:05:49] <katsh> among other minor things. why is this
[13:07:16] <jobelenus> eddiemonge: ios5.0.1 vs 5.1 vs 6 vs droid vs htc vs droidx on ICS vs older vs newer, etc… duh.. the version skew matrix… i can't imagine they are similar/logical/sane -- hence why I'm asking in the channel of the leading mobile project that has to deal with this skew -- does anyone know if/when 'resize' is triggered is relation to 'orientationchange'
[13:07:23] <donburks> katsh: It's returning the HTML as the browser has interpreted it, not necessarily as the user typed it. From the API: This method uses the browser's innerHTML property. Some browsers may not return HTML that exactly replicates the HTML source in an original document. For example, Internet Explorer sometimes leaves off the quotes around attribute values if they contain only alphanumeric characters.
[13:07:45] <katsh> I see
[13:07:48] <katsh> thanks donburks
[13:08:00] <donburks> Np
[13:08:10] <ewaibel> does anyone know if there is a jquery-ui channel?
[13:08:50] <ewaibel> can anyone help with jQuery UI Accordion widget add/remove with refresh?
[13:11:34] <ewaibel> my problem is that we are building a custom widget that uses the jQuery UI Accordion widget and I need to add/remove panels and then refresh the accordion container so that the new/remaining panels resize correctly
[13:18:02] <veQue> i'm trying to use the eggplant theme for jquerymobile
[13:18:16] <chaitime> veQue, so
[13:18:23] <veQue> yeh.. was getting to it
[13:18:35] <veQue> and double checking... I have included both css files
[13:18:46] <veQue> no success
[13:19:24] <veQue> jquery-ui.css and jquery.ui.theme.css
[13:19:40] <ewaibel> hi,  we are building a custom widget that uses the jQuery UI Accordion widget and I need to add/remove panels and then refresh the accordion container so that the new/remaining panels resize correctly. i've gotten the add/remove part to work, but having trouble with the refresh of the accordion's container
[13:19:49] <veQue> even the jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.css
[13:30:57] <eddiemonge> ewaibel: you are calling $(".selector").accordion("refresh"); right?
[13:32:18] <ewaibel> eddiemonge: yes, the problem happens when the panel i am removing is the active panel
[13:33:01] <ewaibel> eddiemonge: when the refresh occurs it recalculates thinking the other panel is still there even though the header&div elements were removed with .remove()
[13:36:11] <eddiemonge> ewaibel: what if you switch to another panel, add/remove whatever and then call refresh? or even disable the widget, do the add/remove and then enable the widget
[13:38:31] <ewaibel> eddiemonge: switching to another panel before removing doesn't seem to help
[13:39:11] <eddiemonge> ewaibel: can you put an example on jsfiddle?
[13:39:31] <ewaibel> eddiemonge: no, code is private
[13:40:45] <eddiemonge> ewaibel: make an example
[13:44:12] <mindtheory> hey guys, what would cause click events to sometimes not trigger properly? I have them assigned to a container div that contains another div with h1/h2/p's. the mouseenter and mouseleave work fine, but click doesn't always trigger. This only happens when I click on the text within the div... clicking on the background is fine
[13:44:32] <mindtheory> assigned using $element.on()
[13:44:59] <eddiemonge> mindtheory: is there anything else assigned to those elements that may be doing a return false or stopPropagation?
[13:45:03] <mindtheory> just wondering why mouseenter and leave would trigger no problem, but click wouldn't register
[13:46:14] <mindtheory> eddiemonge: hmm, there shouldn't be.. there is a stopProgagation on a close button that is currently positioned outside the div (hidden)...
[13:46:18] <mindtheory> but it's small
[13:46:25] <fedya> i'm trying to use the validator plugin with is initiated on document ready, but one of the pages I have it on takes too long to load the dom and sometimes you can hit submit real quick before the document is ready and it will submit without validating, can anyone suggest a remedy?
[13:46:48] <mindtheory> this is a larger area.. i guess i might just have to strip this out to smaller test file and see if i can debug it there.. shame, it's the last thing before this porject is done
[13:46:50] <fedya> I was thinking to disable the submit button until the dom loads
[13:48:09] <mindtheory> eddiemonge: actually, i just got rid of the stopPropagation on the close button and I think it fixed it, wonder how it was intercepting clicks if it was so small
[13:49:53] <ewaibel> eddiemonge: i think the issue is caused by trying to remove the selected element before the other element has been "activated"
[13:50:27] <ewaibel> eddiemonge: do you know how I can trigger the 'activate' callback when setting the 'active' option?
[13:50:53] <mindtheory> eddiemonge: actually, that didn't fix it.. strange, if I double click the text it works fine
[13:50:59] <eddiemonge> fedya: get the page to load faster
[14:02:08] <veQue> http://www.pasteall.org/37672/ am i missing something ? is this the right order ? trying to figure out how to get one of jquery's gallery themese working
[14:02:33] <eddiemonge> ewaibel: not sure. worst case you could destroy the accordion and recreate it
[14:02:44] <veQue> ignore weird pasting errors
[14:02:48] <eddiemonge> veQue: css before js
[14:03:00] <veQue> eddiemonge:  thanks.. but i tryi that too
[14:05:44] <veQue> eddiemonge:  and custom before custom.min ?
[14:08:59] <firstclassfunc> is there a good javascript ide? holy cow, hardly anything good exists (except for webstorm)
[14:09:33] <veQue> yeh i cant figure out how to get thiese themes to work
[14:09:50] <veQue> anyone evver had any success on using a jquery glalery theme?
[14:10:00] <veQue> and how to do it?
[14:10:16] <veQue> i have data-role s
[14:10:24] <veQue> data-role(s)
[14:12:31] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209126/good-javascript-ide-with-jquery-support just googled and came up with this
[14:13:06] <BillCriswell> I don't even think I know what an IDE is really. I need to research more of these letters.
[14:13:44] <eddiemonge> veQue: what are you using jqui for?
[14:14:12] <eddiemonge> firstclassfunc: what are you looking for it to do?
[14:14:22] <veQue> i'm using jquery mobile and I need to begin thmeing it now
[14:14:29] <firstclassfunc> BillCriswell: yeah, originally from 08 though
[14:14:48] <bit0> hello
[14:14:49] <veQue> i want to start testing out the gallery but i downloaded one and cant use it
[14:14:49] <eddiemonge> veQue: ok but what are you using jqUI for?
[14:14:51] <BillCriswell> Ah, good point.
[14:15:03] <veQue> eddiemonge: it came with the download
[14:15:05] <firstclassfunc> eddiemonge: well, simple things like refactoring, syntax checking, etc. I use notepad++ now and it works ok; used eclipse before but was pretty featureless
[14:15:15] <veQue> i dont need it?
[14:15:16] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: Hopefully the IDE's have aged well. :-p
[14:15:49] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: Just regular JavaScript syntax highlighting doesn't work well enough?
[14:15:59] <BillCriswell> Guess I never really thought of it. Hmm
[14:16:02] <veQue> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[14:16:19] <veQue> i went here clicked on tab called gallery clicke the eggplant one
[14:16:28] <eddiemonge> veQue: thats the themeroller for jquery UI not for jQuery Mobile
[14:16:33] <firstclassfunc> BillCriswell: I can just tell you eclipse sucks balls, and notepad++ is only just OK
[14:16:39] <veQue> o_O
[14:16:46] <eddiemonge> firstclassfunc: oh so you are on windows
[14:16:49] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: Ever look into e - texteditor
[14:16:57] <BillCriswell> or sublime text?
[14:17:04] <eddiemonge> firstclassfunc: do you need an IDE or will a good text editor work?
[14:17:10] <eddiemonge> +1 on sublime
[14:17:47] <eddiemonge> veQue: http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/
[14:18:36] <veQue> eddiemonge:  thanks i was hoping o find a gallery of usable themes
[14:18:48] <veQue> before i create my own
[14:19:22] <firstclassfunc> eddiemonge: I'd like intellisense..
[14:23:37] <eddiemonge> veQue: the default comes with 5 different color patterns
[14:23:56] <veQue> ohhh
[14:24:00] <veQue> i see
[14:24:24] <veQue> so i cant use the ones they have in the gallery unless i'm jjust using regular jquery?
[14:24:49] <veQue> or i'll have to just luck up on a free theme site or make my own?
[14:25:10] <ircmaxell> Quick question, is there any handy way to get a promise for dom ready?
[14:25:35] <bakers> ircmaxell: a promise?
[14:25:44] <ircmaxell> yes
[14:25:50] <bakers> ircmaxell: What's that?
[14:25:51] <shoky> $.ready.promise()
[14:26:00] <ircmaxell> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[14:26:03] <Caelum> why is it when I do $('#foo').append('&25B6;') it becomes 'B6;'
[14:26:05] <ircmaxell> thanks shoky
[14:26:38] <BillCriswell> Caelum: Entities.
[14:26:54] <BillCriswell> &amp;25B6; is probably what you want
[14:26:54] <Caelum> BillCriswell: how do I do this?
[14:27:02] <Caelum> ahh thank you very much
[14:27:15] <BillCriswell> No probem.
[14:27:21] <Hans_Henrik> ircmaxell: i ususally do  (function f(){if(document.readyState!=='complete'){setTimeout(f,100);return;}/*...*/})();
[14:27:55] <Hans_Henrik> thats pretty much guarantee the code will run when the dom is ready
[14:28:00] <eddiemonge> veQue: jqueryUI is different than jQuery Mobile
[14:28:04] <Hans_Henrik> even if it was ready long before the code was reached
[14:28:26] <Hans_Henrik> or the other way around.
[14:28:28] <ircmaxell> Hans_Henrik: have you looked a promises and deffered objects?
[14:28:37] <eddiemonge> Hans_Henrik: or you could just you .ready()
[14:28:56] <veQue> Hans_Henrik: well if you can explain in a nutshell what is the difference?
[14:29:21] <Hans_Henrik> oh crap, im in jquery
[14:29:25] <Hans_Henrik> nvm then
[14:29:45] <Hans_Henrik> pretty sure jquery already has that figured out
[14:29:54] <eddiemonge> firstclassfunc: have you looked at aptana?
[14:31:34] <veQue> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSWOBxx9x0w timewaster. .timelapse of web development
[14:31:43] <veQue> was just looking for jquery tut
[14:31:49] <veQue> =P dont shoot me
[14:32:08] <mindtheory> anyone have an idea why this would be happening? Clicking on the bold header of a small/collapsed box on this page (such as in between the L and the K on the words SCIENCE OF IMITATION MILK) seems to cause the click even to not get triggered sometimes. It's up here http://responsive.silktricky.com/
[14:32:21] <mindtheory> but moving the mouse over a pixel makes it work...
[14:32:30] <mindtheory> the mouseenter/mouseleave works fine
[14:32:53] <mindtheory> and clicking twice fast seems to make it work fine
[14:33:23] <mindtheory> i'm stumped!
[14:34:32] <BillCriswell> mindtheory: I can't replicate what you're saying.
[14:35:10] <mindtheory> BillCriswell: hmm.. it's only sometimes, like if you click on the bold heading... with the mouse in between or on two of those all caps headings
[14:35:18] <mindtheory> BillCriswell: driving me nuts
[14:35:28] <mindtheory> BillCriswell: happens in Chrome and Safari for me on Mac
[14:37:07] <BillCriswell> mindtheory: When tiny little off things like that start happening I restart my browser.
[14:38:07] <mindtheory> BillCriswell: i wish that was it ;) I can get it to consistently happen within 5 clicks on both browsers
[14:38:18] <mindtheory> BillCriswell: by putting mouse in between the L and K on MILK
[14:38:24] <mindtheory> sucks!
[14:38:43] <BillCriswell> mindtheory: Is the pointer cursor going away?
[14:39:32] <BillCriswell> I'm on Chrome on Mac as well and it's fine.
[14:39:41] <BillCriswell> mindtheory: Did you try in an Incognito window?
[14:40:06] <BillCriswell> Wait you said it's happening in Chrome and Safari. Hmm..
[14:40:43] <mindtheory> BillCriswell: i'll try in incognito. The cursor stays as the pointer and mouseleave doesn't get triggered.. so it's not like it's losing focus of the object.. it's strange.. the click's getting intercepted somehow
[14:40:54] <mindtheory> BillCriswell: and i can't find any overlapping objects
[14:41:00] <wachpwnski> if you use $.when(deferred).done( function(d) { foo(d); bar(d); };
[14:41:14] <wachpwnski> are foo and bar executed asynchronously?
[14:41:26] <wachpwnski> assuming they are functions with ajax requests?
[14:41:54] <mindtheory> BillCriswell: ditto in incognito
[14:42:46] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: foo is fired and then bar is
[14:43:19] <wachpwnski> ok but if in that function i return $.ajax it will just be async right?
[14:43:33] <wachpwnski> Looks like it.
[14:44:04] <BillCriswell> mindtheory: Try it on another computer?
[14:44:09] <eddiemonge> mindtheory: something is doing something to the .info div
[14:44:18] <wachpwnski> if foo is defined as foo() { $.ajax() } it is synchronous, but if I do foo() { return $.ajax() } it is asynchronous
[14:44:39] <eddiemonge> mindtheory: as in its animating it or something causing the mouse to not be able to click its original target
[14:45:12] <mindtheory> eddiemonge: ok thanks - that's something that might help me find it... the animating thing, i'll dig into it
[14:45:38] <eddiemonge> mindtheory: try removing this line: $('.project .info').ellipsis({live:true});
[14:45:48] <eddiemonge> main.js line 205
[14:45:56] <mindtheory> eddiemonge: ahh that effing thing, it's caused so much trouble
[14:46:41] <wachpwnski> is there a difference between getElementByid('id') and $('#id') ?
[14:46:51] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: yes
[14:47:01] <BillCriswell> wachpwnski: One returns a jQuery object, other doesn't.
[14:47:12] <mindtheory> eddiemonge: I love you
[14:47:20] <mindtheory> eddiemonge: works now, thanks a lot
[14:47:33] <BillCriswell> Why couldn't I replicate the issu?
[14:47:41] <wachpwnski> I would guess that is why google doesn't play nice with it then. ahah
[14:47:56] <FrozenFire> A client wants a horrendous and computationally expensive "fly in" effect for list items which are images. Anyone have a drop-in solution for that?
[14:48:12] * FrozenFire weeps
[14:48:13] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: i had to keep refreshing the page. and you had to hold the cursor in place for a bit
[14:48:29] <wachpwnski> So if one of my parametes is expecting a jquery object i should probably do foo( $param ) { .. } ?
[14:48:36] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Ohh.
[14:48:39] <eddiemonge> FrozenFire: animate in jqueryUI?
[14:49:19] <BillCriswell> I had to look at that wolf lion for like 10 minutes to notice it was a wolf lion.
[14:49:25] <BillCriswell> Damn brain.
[14:51:43] <BillCriswell> Also, last night something occurred to me. A fucking mummy is just a zombie all wrapped up.
[14:51:58] <Space-Duck> Can anyone help me simplify my ajax problem? http://pastebin.com/wADCKwg5
[14:52:15] <salah> Hi, is there any ways to add ellipsis to a element that is under another element? the content of a span element breaks over another span if the screen is to small
[14:53:28] <BillCriswell> Space-Duck: You can remove the ?i=0 part of the url option and put it in the data option.
[14:53:40] <sunbeam> Hi, does anyone know if class.class1{} this selector works cross browser ?
[14:53:41] <sunbeam> of course apart from ie6?
[14:54:26] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: I believe you want .class.class1 {}
[14:54:38] <BillCriswell> I believe that works in ie6 as well.
[14:55:37] <Space-Duck> BillCriswell, thanks! I guess I was just being lazy. I was more looking for a way to have one function loop perform my multiple steps
[14:56:05] <BillCriswell> Space-Duck: Does each step require different data?
[14:56:44] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: yes
[14:57:14] <Space-Duck> BillCriswell, nope the user submitted data is the same throughout.
[14:58:04] <BillCriswell> Space-Duck: Ohh.. You could put this into a loop. for( var step = 1; step <= 4; step++ ) { } then in there put i in data as { i: step }
[14:58:17] <BillCriswell> I mean.. Why does it need to be multiple steps though?
[14:59:23] <Space-Duck> BillCriswell, I need multiple steps mostly for debugging (but eventually a progress bar). I need to know if one of the curl executions fail.
[15:00:15] <wachpwnski> how can you select an element with jquery then get its object like getElementById ?
[15:00:35] <BillCriswell> $('#id')[0] should... or $('#id').get(0) I think.
[15:00:55] <eddiemonge> ^^ correct
[15:01:04] <BillCriswell> However... if ou don't need jQuery though just use document.getElementById('id')
[15:04:18] <BillCriswell> Later dudes.
[15:08:33] <black_warlock> guys
[15:08:38] <black_warlock> 1milion dolar question
[15:09:01] <black_warlock> is it possible to hide the iframe link to make it private?
[15:12:15] <eddiemonge> hide the iframe link?
[15:13:11] <black_warlock> source
[15:13:48] <black_warlock> i wish to hide the iframe source but i think with js its possible to decript it
[15:14:12] <black_warlock> because the key to encrypt must be called on client side
[15:14:15] <eddiemonge> what do you mean by hide the iframe source?
[15:14:37] <black_warlock> i frame src="pip.com/video.html"
[15:15:03] <black_warlock> i want the link to the page hidden
[15:17:49] <black_warlock> hum
[15:17:54] <eddiemonge> just the link?
[15:18:02] <black_warlock> on coolstreaming they did it
[15:18:13] <finspin> hi, im trying to clone an element on focus event and insert it into the DOM. i want that the focus event is fired on the last element. my current code fires the focus event only on the initial element (i.e. it's not active on the elements that were inserted into DOM via jQuery). here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/LQEy5/1/. what am i doing wrong?
[15:20:29] <eddiemonge> black_warlock: only way i can think of is if you call a script on your server that then gets the iframe target link and returns what it returns
[15:21:15] <eddiemonge> finspin: you arent focus'ing after inserting it
[15:22:27] <eddiemonge> finspin: http://jsfiddle.net/LQEy5/2/
[15:23:32] <eddiemonge> finspin: like that or do you also want the input to have focus when its created (which would be weird [this whole thing seems weird to me anyway])?
[15:24:12] <finspin> eddiemonge: thanks
[15:24:40] <finspin> eddiemonge: no, no need to focus on creation
[15:25:18] <finspin> eddiemonge: what seems weird to you?
[15:26:27] <eddiemonge> creating a new input on focus of an input. whats its purpose?
[15:27:34] <finspin> eddiemonge: one use case could be adding new names into your contact list. imagine user wants to add 10 names but you don't want to show all the fields at once.
[15:27:46] <Caelum> how do you append a .ready() function to the bottom of the stack, so that it fires after any .ready() functions added after it
[15:30:52] <eddiemonge> finspin: then add the field on submit, or clear the field and refocus it on submit
[15:31:15] <eddiemonge> Caelum: move it to the bottom
[15:31:16] <someprimetime> Caelum: wat
[15:32:33] <Caelum> I found the solution, $(window).load()
[15:33:53] <finspin> eddiemonge: that's exactly what i want to avoid. user doesn't have to submit or press "add new" when adding multiple contacts. new empty input field is always ready for him if he needs it.
[15:34:16] <finspin> it's a good user experience
[15:37:40] <someprimetime> finspin: that's not good user experience IMO to do
[15:37:47] <someprimetime> if i want a new input, i'll add it
[15:37:57] <someprimetime> but if i focus onto something else and it's added, i'll be annoyed
[15:38:05] <someprimetime> but i got here late so i'm assuming that's what you are doing?
[15:39:00] <finspin> someprimetime: maybe i didn't explain it clear enough. just take a look how Basecamp invites new team members.
[15:42:26] <eddiemonge> Caelum: thats not a good solution
[15:43:06] <eddiemonge> finspin: you are using basecamp as an example of good ui?
[15:46:31] <finspin> eddiemonge: so why exactly is this solution not good?
[15:47:21] <wachpwnski> can you chain element creation?
[15:47:53] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: yes
[15:48:03] <wachpwnski> how do you do that?
[15:48:25] <wachpwnski> $.('<div/>'). ?
[15:48:34] <eddiemonge> finspin: im thinking something like tabbing through the form. if you are on the last element, try to tab to the submit button, you will instead tab to a new input and never get to the end
[15:49:07] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: adding elements to the same thing? like appending multiple elements?
[15:49:34] <wachpwnski> no i want to create a div, and then put a div in that div
[15:52:35] <someprimetime>     var $el1 = $('<div />').addClass('className1'); var $el2 = $('<div />').addClass('className2');  $el1.append($el2).appendTo($('body'));
[15:54:20] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/wishlist/ - ui dialog modal pops up by clicking the link that begins with "if you represent..." and my form is not validating or submitting
[15:54:36] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/wishlist/scripts/wishlist.js is the file that has all of that in it
[15:54:47] <jacobroufa> line 41 is where it starts
[15:54:59] <jacobroufa> anyone have a clue wtf is going on? im at my wits end. i cant seem to debug this damned thing
[15:55:20] <jonathancutrell> Hey - is Paul in here right now?
[15:55:31] <jonathancutrell> or someone else particularly involved with Chrome?
[15:57:28] <someprimetime> is Paul in here?
[15:57:31] <someprimetime> wtf
[15:57:36] <ryanneufeld>  jacobroufa http://cl.ly/image/2f2e1g063K25
[15:57:39] <someprimetime> Paul who?
[15:57:49] <jonathancutrell> someprimetime: Sorry - Irish
[15:57:56] <someprimetime> no he doesn't hang out in here
[15:58:08] <jacobroufa> ryanneufeld: thats a different version of jquery
[15:58:11] <someprimetime> but is he on IRC right now? yes
[15:58:19] <ryanneufeld> jacobroufa: start by fixing those errors
[15:58:30] <jacobroufa> ryanneufeld: rather, a different version of jquery and a whole other set of scripts i have no control over are handling that nonsense
[15:59:00] <jacobroufa> ryanneufeld: wish it were that easy... :(
[15:59:32] <jacobroufa> my corporate overlords require i adhere to their strict guidelines w/r/t ads and wrapper themes
[15:59:38] <jacobroufa> total bollocks if you ask me
[15:59:43] <jacobroufa> but thats my situation
[15:59:58] <ryanneufeld> do you have a local copy to develop on?
[16:00:22] <jacobroufa> yeah. same issue. its totally unrelated to the other errors on the page
[16:00:31] <jacobroufa> ive scoped it that way purposefully
[16:00:32] <ryanneufeld> okay
[16:00:56] <jacobroufa> hence the iife around my script that pulls in jquery.noconflict
[16:02:02] <eddiemonge> jacobroufa: shouldnt you validate on submit?
[16:03:08] <eddiemonge> jacobroufa: not sure if its related but you also have  novalidate="novalidate" on the form
[16:03:32] <jacobroufa> eddiemonge: according to the jquery validation docs thats how it needs to be structured.
[16:03:58] <jacobroufa> at least, thats how it was in the docs
[16:05:55] <jacobroufa> eddiemonge: removed it and it popped back up
[16:06:05] <jacobroufa> must be an attr that gets set by the plugin
[16:06:16] <jacobroufa> never used jquery validation plugin before
[16:07:42] <eddiemonge> jacobroufa: why cant you update the jquery for the main site?
[16:08:01] <jacobroufa> i have no control over it
[16:08:05] <jacobroufa> or i would
[16:08:26] <jacobroufa> at any given time there can be up to 5 different versions of jquery (and several other frameworks) running simultaneously
[16:08:30] <jacobroufa> its a wonder there arent more errors
[16:08:39] <jacobroufa> parent company says no
[16:12:50] <eddiemonge> jacobroufa: that is weird. you should be the person who enacts change for the better
[16:13:27] <jacobroufa> ive tried to tell my boss but basically what it comes down to is this same platform is rolled out to several hundred sites and we literally have no say
[16:17:50] <ColKurtz> >5 different version of jquery
[16:17:52] <ColKurtz> lol oh god
[16:17:58] <ColKurtz> the sites must perform like a nightmare
[16:18:17] <ronson> why does jquery return 0 for the .width() of an element in a display none body tag
[16:19:58] <eddiemonge> ronson: because it has no width?
[16:20:26] <ronson> but this element does have width
[16:21:07] <ColKurtz> the element has no rendered width
[16:21:24] <ColKurtz> does $(el).css('width'); return the CSS value you set for width?
[16:24:12] <wachpwnski> can you use both .done and .then with $.when?
[16:24:25] <wachpwnski> like $.when().done().then() ?
[16:25:16] <shoky> wachpwnski: try it and see?
[16:25:24] <jacobroufa> ColKurtz: yes. nightmare indeed
[16:25:27] <jacobroufa> :)
[16:25:28] <jacobroufa> anyway
[16:25:38] <jacobroufa> i think im out. forget this. i gotta rest my eyes and then attack it later
[16:26:00] <shoky> wachpwnski: $.when returns a promise
[16:26:11] <josePHPagoda> hello everyone!
[16:26:24] <josePHPagoda> is it possible to change the accept-encoding header in an ajax request?
[16:29:31] <shoky> josePHPagoda: you can change it using the 'headers' option but most browsers will block the request
[16:29:37] <ryanneufeld> josePHPagoda: see ?ajax
[16:29:38] <bot-t> josePHPagoda, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:29:45] <shoky> so the short answer is no
[16:30:40] <wachpwnski> shoky:  doesn't look like it is working, I am returning a deffered
[16:30:43] <wachpwnski> deferred*
[16:30:51] <josePHPagoda> bummer
[16:30:51] <josePHPagoda> ok
[16:30:58] <shoky> wachpwnski: oh well.. ?
[16:31:40] <shoky> wachpwnski: anyway it should work
[16:34:23] <wachpwnski> shoky, the .then doesn't work for me
[16:34:30] <wachpwnski> but .done does
[16:34:39] <shoky> wachpwnski: fiddle it
[16:35:12] * veQue tunes fiddle
[16:35:19] * veQue hoedowns
[16:35:48] <veQue> i love fiddles
[16:36:50] <wachpwnski> shoky:  http://jsfiddle.net/emVBA/
[16:37:07] <wachpwnski> the bottom one works the top when doesn't
[16:39:24] <shoky> wachpwnski: you want to send 2 requests?
[16:39:47] <shoky> or just showin both ok
[16:40:46] <shoky> btw you know that you don't need $.when here, right?
[16:40:56] <shoky> getDomainSummary(domain).done(...)
[16:41:46] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: what are you asking?
[16:44:06] <shoky> wachpwnski: they're both working fine: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/emVBA/1/
[16:44:43] <shoky> you had d.reject; instead of d.reject();
[16:59:05] <veQue> you ever put random letters in the jsfiddle url to see what happens? http://jsfiddle.net/adEWR/ http://jsfiddle.net/rqQWE/ figured i would
[16:59:56] <Caelum> can you use the .each and .map functions on regular js arrays? like $(some_array).each(...)
[17:00:48] <eddiemonge> Caelum: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[17:01:30] <Caelum> ok cool
[17:01:46] <Caelum> that will be really great for IE8 which has no array functions
[17:03:02] <Caelum> and es5-shim breaks jquery for some reason
[17:13:38] <sweb> is any method for determine ... scroll is now on top of div ...
[17:13:39] <sweb> ?
[17:13:48] <rainabba> Anyone here that uses the JSON.Net library with jQuery: I'm trying to use JSON.Net to serialize an iList and return that from a method in an .ASMX web service. The output is exactly what I want, but when jQuery tries to consume it, things break so I used Chrome debug tools to check out the reply from the web service and it looks like all the data is being escaped so there's one object returned
[17:13:48] <rainabba> "d", with a value that is the escaped JSON that "I" returned. What's causing this encapsulation, is it "normal", and how do I best "resolve" this without manipulating the string manually in hackish ways?
[17:21:22] <czytacz> hi, i've got a small problem
[17:21:24] <czytacz> so I have sth like this: <li><a></a><ul></ul><li>
[17:21:40] <czytacz> I want jquery to modify <ul> after me clicking on <a>
[17:22:08] <czytacz> how do I point to the neighbour tag?
[17:22:13] <eddiemonge> Caelum: array functions?
[17:22:34] <Caelum> eddiemonge: like forEach and every
[17:22:44] <Caelum> eddiemonge: they are not in IE8
[17:22:49] <eddiemonge> rainabba: are you talking about jsonp?

[17:23:22] <eddiemonge> Caelum: they arent in a lot of things. you could loop through the arrays
[17:24:13] <Caelum> eddiemonge: that's what I've been doing, but if I can use each and map from jquery that's much nicer
[17:25:24] <eddiemonge> rainabba: that doesnt tell me anything about your problem
[17:26:47] <rainabba> eddiemonge: You asked if I was using jsonp. I said I was using JSON.Net. That link should clarify any confusion about what I'm using. Did I miss something?
[17:27:14] <rainabba> eddiemonge: THIS tells you all about my problem: Anyone here that uses the JSON.Net library with jQuery: I'm trying to use JSON.Net to serialize an iList and return that from a method in an .ASMX web service. The output is exactly what I want, but when jQuery tries to consume it, things break so I used Chrome debug tools to check out the reply from the web service and it looks like all the data
[17:27:14] <rainabba> is being escaped so there's one object returned "d", with a value that is the escaped JSON that "I" returned. What's causing this encapsulation, is it "normal", and how do I best "resolve" this without manipulating the string manually in hackish ways?
[17:28:06] <eddiemonge> Caelum: nicer but slower
[17:28:06] <shoky> rainabba: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3418013/json-asmx-and-that-pesky-d
[17:28:21] <rainabba> shoky: Thank you
[17:28:23] <eddiemonge> rainabba: i mean it sounds like you are getting jsonp returned
[17:30:03] <mlang> Hey! Is there a way to add a transition time to a css function?
[17:31:17] <eddiemonge> mlang: like to animate it?
[17:31:25] <mlang> Yepp.
[17:32:41] <czytacz> thanks eddiemonge, looks like this is what I needed
[17:33:11] <eddiemonge> mlang: why not use animate?
[17:34:09] <mlang> eddiemonge: because i wasn't thinking about it.
[17:34:12] <mlang> Thanks! :)
[17:36:23] <rainabba> shoky: So the d encapsulation isn't new but now I see the issue. The value of d being escaped and presented as one large value rather than an a json array is my problem. It almost seems as if JSON.Net expects me to extract the value of d client-side, then unescape it before consuming. That make sense to you? Are you familiar with that library (JSON.Net)? I'm going to Google as well now that I
[17:36:23] <rainabba> have new info to work with, but if you know something and are in the mood to help rather than let me find the answer the long way, I'd be grateful :)
[17:37:48] <shoky> rainabba: sorry im not familiar with it at all, i just googled ;P
[17:37:57] <rainabba> Ok, thanks.
[17:38:23] <rainabba> I'm finding plenty of others who've encountered the same. Just need to find the solution now.
[17:39:16] <tom_anderson> I'd like to announce a new Tag Manager: http://soliantconsulting.github.com/tagmanager/
[17:45:16] <phonebook_> hi jquizzle i come in peace
[17:45:22] <phonebook_> anyone want to help me? an artsy/inset problem. will be a pain but a nice snippet to have when done.
[17:45:52] <rainabba> Easy enough. In my $.ajax call I'm using $.map(data.d). The results I'm getting (value of d) just needs to be parsed as json so now I'm using $.map(parseJSON(data.d)) and all is well there.
[17:46:08] <rainabba> shoky: Thanks again
[17:46:17] <mlang> https://gist.github.com/4180102
[17:46:28] <mlang> Doesnt seem any idea why?
[17:46:42] <mlang> Okay.. try again. Doesn't seem to work. any idea why?
[17:50:36] <eddiemonge> rainabba: $.parseJSON or parseJSON?
[17:50:49] <rainabba> $.parseJSON()
[17:51:09] <aqeel> hi room
[17:51:10] <rainabba> response($.map($.parseJSON(data.d), function(item) {}
[17:54:08] <eddiemonge> mlang: no idea. can you show the compiled js?
[18:00:38] <sunbeam> jQuery(this).children("ul");
[18:00:43] <sunbeam> how can i only select the first ul child ?
[18:01:51] <black_warlock> ?
[18:02:15] <black_warlock> what you mean ?
[18:02:23] <black_warlock> the first li ?
[18:02:30] <black_warlock> or the first elem that find
[18:02:31] <mlang> eddiemonge: https://gist.github.com/4180155
[18:03:02] <black_warlock> sunbeam ?
[18:03:19] <sunbeam> simply the first UL
[18:03:24] <sunbeam> so this > ul
[18:03:29] <sunbeam> and not this ul ul
[18:03:50] <black_warlock> .closest ul
[18:04:12] <tom_anderson> HI, aqeel et al.  Here's a newly released product: http://soliantconsulting.github.com/tagmanager/
[18:04:32] <black_warlock> $(this).closest('ul')
[18:05:27] <black_warlock> it will take the first ul that find inside ul
[18:05:38] <eddiemonge> mlang: http://api.jquery.com/animate/#animation-properties
[18:05:53] <black_warlock> .find('ul') the first parent ul
[18:06:08] <black_warlock> or parent('ul')
[18:06:34] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: $(this).children("ul").first()
[18:06:39] <mlang> eddiemonge: So no Border-Bottom for me? :(
[18:07:00] <eddiemonge> mlang: not without the color plugin, and you should animate one thing at a time
[18:07:36] <mlang> eddiemonge: Gotcha, thank you.
[18:08:09] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: thanks

[19:22:58] <warbler> I'm a desperate man who lacks knowledge! Anyone feel like making a quick $10 via paypal? Solve this for me http://pastebin.com/BP4hdvQk -- Should be simple for anyone with javascript/jquery knowledge as it isn't much code!
[19:35:31] <shoky> warbler: that code references non-existent elements
[19:36:07] <shoky> warbler: setInterval( updateShoutbox, 30000 )   should do..
[19:36:14] <shoky> for a start
[19:37:53] <warbler> A guy in ##javascript told me this would work: http://pastebay.net/1159098
[19:38:23] <warbler> Is that right or? Looks like he took a bunch of code out of the initial top code.
[19:38:51] <shoky> very similar to what i said..
[19:39:00] <shoky> i just suggested forgetting about that new code altogether
[19:39:12] <warbler> Which is best?
[19:39:16] <warbler> Or does it matter
[19:39:41] <shoky> its the same, really
[19:39:59] <shoky> mine's simpler, but only works if you can change the original code
[19:40:24] <shoky> actually so does his, nevermind
[19:41:43] <warbler> his code didn't work
[19:41:51] <warbler> testing with my wife right now
[19:41:56] <warbler> hrm
[19:43:01] <shoky> this was my suggestion- http://pastebin.com/GRQ744gx
[19:43:10] <shoky> just added that one line:  setInterval( updateShoutbox, 30000 )
[19:44:18] <warbler> yours worked!
[19:44:25] <warbler> is there any way to do it in real time or?
[19:44:34] <shoky> meaning?
[19:44:35] <warbler> would that be resource intensive on the server?
[19:44:46] <shoky> oh
[19:44:50] <warbler> when someone types something it comes up in real time
[19:45:00] <warbler> or is that completely different playing field
[19:45:42] <warbler> also, what is your paypal email so i can send you $10
[19:45:46] <shoky> uh it's possible, i donno that much about it
[19:46:00] <shoky> mm that's ok
[19:46:02] <shoky> thanks
[19:46:12] <warbler> alright, thanks a ton for the help
[19:46:16] <warbler> truly appreciated!
[19:46:24] <shoky> yer welcome
[19:49:25] <warbler> solution i have from you kind of sucks because the loading screen on the shoutbox randomly appears... =(
[19:49:32] <warbler> but it still works nonetheless
[19:49:42] <shoky> that can be solved pretty easily
[19:49:51] <warbler> how so?
[19:49:57] <warbler> are you sure you dont want $10?
[19:50:04] <warbler> :/
[19:50:14] <warbler> you are helping me an awful lot

[20:59:23] <veQue> jquery mobile theme roller
[20:59:48] <veQue> nvrmnd i see my problem
[21:02:12] <tehOPEologist> hi all
[21:02:29] <pachet> hi
[21:02:30] <tehOPEologist> is there a way when a link is clicked for jquery to completely rewrite the contents of an element?
[21:02:48] <tehOPEologist> like this.click {rewritethewholedamnthing};
[21:03:20] <tehOPEologist> *click()
[21:03:44] <pachet> what do you mean by rewrite the contents?
[21:03:47] <tehOPEologist> like
[21:03:49] <pachet> rewrite with what?
[21:04:10] <tehOPEologist> rewrite the syntax of the contents of the tag selected.
[21:04:19] <tehOPEologist> so if header.click() is selected
[21:04:30] <tehOPEologist> can i rewrite the contents of <header>?
[21:04:31] <tehOPEologist> somehow?
[21:04:37] <tehOPEologist> (using html5 btw)
[21:04:49] <tehOPEologist> for the tags, at least
[21:06:03] <bot-t> tehOPEologist, .html(htmlString): Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[21:06:33] <pachet> $('header').on('click.some_namespace', function ( event ) { var element = $(this), html = element.html(); /* do stuff with html */ element.html(html); });
[21:09:38] <tehOPEologist> hmmmm  that's an interesting way to do it..  i'll have to try that out.  give me a sec
[21:13:01] <rainabba> I have a strange issue with .AutoComplete() where my .value is displaying instead of .label. Full description and code at: http://pastebin.com/TK1L3y2i if anyone wants to take a peek. I've got two separate instances behaving the same way and I'm sure that I have no other code that would be updating the values because this is the only code that would have access to that data.
[21:19:56] <veQue> i swear i'm doing this right but color wont animate
[21:20:18] <veQue> .animate({color:'orange'},250);
[21:28:23] <veQue> oh i guess i need a plugin
[21:28:36] <pachet> yeah
[21:30:55] <veQue> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/ this the right hting?seems like a bunch of weird steps
[21:39:20] <veQue> this is where i go, is it really worth it
[21:39:31] <veQue> cause i dont even know what grunt it
[21:39:41] <veQue> the want me to download it
[21:54:10] <tehOPEologist> so i created an if statement, and it's not acting like it should :(
[21:55:04] <tehOPEologist> http://pastebin.com/JrnKC6yc
[21:55:08] <tehOPEologist> is what i'm trying to do
[21:55:54] <tehOPEologist> any idea why it's not working?
[21:56:42] <pachet> well, there's a handful of things going on here
[21:56:45] <pachet> 1) you're not calling jquery
[21:56:46] <tehOPEologist> haha
[21:56:53] <pachet> you just have empty statements within parentheses
[21:56:57] <tehOPEologist> i figured there was some crazy shit i was messin up
[21:57:02] <tehOPEologist> long day at work, then had an idea >_<
[21:57:24] <pachet> if ( $('a#login_click').click() ) { is probably what you were thinking
[21:57:33] <tehOPEologist> oh shit
[21:57:42] <tehOPEologist> you have to call the if condition like that?
[21:57:45] <pachet> which still doesnt make much sense, but at least its semantically possible to have that doing *something*
[21:57:48] <tehOPEologist> i'm still thinking js
[21:57:52] <pachet> but its definitely not valid jquery
[21:57:57] <tehOPEologist> hmm
[21:58:12] <tehOPEologist> i'm basically clicking on a link, which then does something to another element
[21:58:22] <pachet> you want to programmatically click the link?
[21:58:23] <tehOPEologist> figured an if would work for this situation
[21:58:38] <tehOPEologist> you click the link (empty, # is the href)
[21:58:47] <tehOPEologist> and something happens to another element
[21:59:04] <pachet> so you're wanting to wait for the user to click the link
[21:59:34] <tehOPEologist> yes
[21:59:41] <pachet> ok, so the concept at hand is
[21:59:43] <pachet> event listeners
[21:59:44] <tehOPEologist> figured if was needed
[22:00:02] <pachet> jquery does a good job of abstracting away the headache behind them but you'd be well served reading about them in full
[22:00:07] <r500> tehOPEologist: will you prefer  http://jsfiddle.net/ instead of pastebin?
[22:00:08] <pachet> ?g mdn addEventListener
[22:00:10] <bot-t> pachet, element.addEventListener - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.addEventListener
[22:00:31] <tehOPEologist> sure i'll use jsfiddle, no worries.  my apologie
[22:00:33] <tehOPEologist> *apologies
[22:00:51] <tehOPEologist> patchet, that's good..  i haven't used jquery in a while..  still remembering everything >_<
[22:01:49] <tehOPEologist> will the type of event listener be the .click?
[22:02:46] <Luke_> hola
[22:02:55] <Luke_> whatsup y'all
[22:03:24] <Luke_> is anyone using this channel?

[22:18:19] <Luke_> do you know much about webkit transitions?
[22:18:32] <hateIE> a little
[22:19:31] <Luke_> iim trying to figure out how to implement this icon transition on the intro page of www.freddytodd.com on my albums page as buy icons
[22:22:03] <hateIE> ive been trying to solve a problem all night and now ive started to hulicinate my brain is turning [] on array value blue like its got its own internal syntax highlighting

[22:23:31] <RingtailedFox> hey-hey, everyone! i'm trying to make a jquery table of contents box like wikipedia, but i have some odd issues...
[22:24:33] <RingtailedFox> as you can see at http://www.mobianlegends.com/links/contact.php , if i use "return" it truncates everything beneath it. if i use "echo", the box is not formatted... how do i get it to work properly?
[22:25:17] <Luke_> hateIE: link? i dont know much about these things
[22:25:46] <RingtailedFox> you can see the code for yourself... just replace .php with .txt
[22:28:53] <warbler> would someone please help me I'm going insane... look at the shoutbox scrollbar(s) www.pointstackers.com
[22:29:37] <warbler> i have to use scroller.js to keep the scrollbar at the bottom, and I'm trying to style it with jScrollPane
[22:29:41] <warbler> is that even possible?
[22:29:53] <warbler> maybe ill just divide by zero while im at it
[22:30:02] <RingtailedFox> is there any way to fix my issue?
[22:30:12] <warbler> there's always a way
[22:33:26] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: it needs to be echo since its not in a function call
[22:33:46] <RingtailedFox> ok
[22:33:59] <RingtailedFox> changing to echo now
[22:34:13] <RingtailedFox> refresh contact.php
[22:34:17] <RingtailedFox> and contact.txt
[22:34:55] <RingtailedFox> it shows "Table of Contents" with an <hr> below it for about a second, then loads an unformatted list of links... how do i get them to stay bulleted and BELOW the Table of Contents <hr> section?
[22:36:13] <RingtailedFox> do i need to put something like <a name="$toc"> or something?
[22:38:42] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: what are you trying to do? what is tableofcontents.js supposed to do?
[22:38:55] <eTiger13> and the list isnt styled because you didnt style the anchor tags
[22:39:12] <RingtailedFox> how do i style the anchor tags? and how do i keep it from removing "Table of Contents"?
[22:39:23] <RingtailedFox> tableofcontents.js is from an earlier attempt at this
[22:39:33] <eTiger13> you dont know css?
[22:39:48] <RingtailedFox> i do know CSS... i jsut don't know what values it wants
[22:40:02] <RingtailedFox> i already have styles for h1 through h6
[22:40:25] <hateIE> what is the best method to get a table colum into a array
[22:42:09] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: you want display block
[22:42:28] <eTiger13> hateIE: loop through the table getting the cells?
[22:43:06] <RingtailedFox> yes
[22:43:21] <RingtailedFox> a box with "Table of Contents"<hr> then the bulleted list
[22:43:31] <RingtailedFox> possibly indented for subheaders, like wikipedia's
[22:45:07] <RingtailedFox> the question is.... how?
[22:46:12] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: um use a ul?
[22:46:19] <RingtailedFox> already am
[22:46:28] <RingtailedFox> http://www.mobianlegends.com/links/contact.php
[22:46:35] <RingtailedFox> http://www.mobianlegends.com/links/contact.txt
[22:46:36] <RingtailedFox> check the code :)
[22:46:46] <RingtailedFox> it already has <ul> tags
[22:48:45] <hateIE> I want to go colum by collum but im not having much like with .find
[22:48:56] <hateIE> er ^^ luck even
[22:49:04] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: it looks empty
[22:49:15] <RingtailedFox> which lines look empty?
[22:49:21] <eTiger13> hateIE: use .eq()
[22:50:32] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: look at the rendered code on line 387
[22:51:59] <RingtailedFox> <div id="toc"> ?
[22:52:10] <eTiger13> yes
[22:52:12] <RingtailedFox> so i have to specify it in a Cascading Style Sheet?
[22:52:29] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: ever hear of indentation
[22:52:31] <RingtailedFox> hooboy... i was really hoping to avoid CSS, but i have no choice..
[22:52:35] <RingtailedFox> yes
[22:52:48] <warbler> How do I make this scrollbar go from the top to the bottom all the way the length of the text? www.pointstackers.com see the shoutbox
[22:53:02] <RingtailedFox> indentation doesn't matter to HTML the way it does to python
[22:54:22] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: no but it matters for readability. if people cant read your code, thats no good
[22:54:28] <RingtailedFox> i guess
[22:54:31] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: and why are you trying to solve a CSS problem with JS
[22:54:38] <RingtailedFox> you said to...
[22:54:46] <RingtailedFox> i was just trying to make a wikipedia-style tabel of contents
[22:55:31] <eTiger13> warbler: dont use <center>
[22:55:35] <RingtailedFox> read mobianlegends.com/sonic.css lines 183-199... already have #toc stated
[22:55:38] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: like what? theres a lot
[22:55:46] <warbler> ok
[22:56:01] <RingtailedFox> ?
[22:56:40] <eTiger13> warbler: are you trying to just have a styled scroller?
[22:56:53] <rainabba> Line 3 logs a complete object (array) and each item has the properties I want. Line 7 logs a number that increase sequentially for each item but otherwise provide no other data/attributes so I can't reference the .ItemID and .ItemName attributes of each item in the "list" object using .each(). Where have I gone wrong? http://pastebin.com/TK1L3y2i
[22:57:49] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: hX elements dont go in a <p> tag.
[22:58:14] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: 404 for that css. inspect your elements. they arent styled
[22:59:24] <rainabba> Heh. Guess I just use "this" instead of "item".
[22:59:25] <eTiger13> RingtailedFox: i think you should start with pure html/css, get the styling right, then add your js, then convert it to dynamic using php
[22:59:26] <hateIE> ah yeh
[22:59:31] <hateIE> eq will make it easier
[22:59:32] <warbler> eTiger13 yes and it needs to scroll to the bottom of the shoutbox automatically...ive been at this for about 4 hours now
[22:59:48] <eTiger13> warbler: and you cant just use a normal scrollbar?
[22:59:57] <warbler> normal gray scrollbar is ugly
[23:00:09] <warbler> i want to make it match the site colors
[23:00:30] <warbler> once i get the dang thing fully functional i can style up the colors
[23:00:32] <eTiger13> rainabba: actually list is an object, not an array
[23:00:49] <warbler> it's not scrolling the full length of the div contents though....
[23:01:16] <eTiger13> rainabba: and you should contruct an html fragment and then append that at once instead of appending in the loop
[23:01:17] <rainabba> eTiger13: Know what pedantic means?
[23:01:46] <rainabba> Performance is better that way?
[23:01:57] <eTiger13> warbler: no idea. something probably in the css or js that isnt getting the height right. could you simplify to a test case and put it on jsfiddle
[23:03:02] <eTiger13> rainabba: performance is far better
[23:03:10] <eTiger13> and im going to ignore your first question
[23:03:11] <rainabba> Ok, ty.
[23:05:21] <rainabba> By saying that you're going to ignore it, you've already acknowledged it thank you very much and you know you were being exactly that. It was an "object" and more specifically, it was a collection but I've been coding for 20 years (started with GWBasic on DOS 3 and then Borland C) and anyone who knows what they're doing would gather more information from "list is an array" than "list is an
[23:05:21] <rainabba> object" and it's shorter than "list is a collection of objects each containing properties". Right? :)

[23:06:33] <warbler> using jScrollPane
[23:08:21] <RingtailedFox> sorry

[23:08:53] <RingtailedFox> actually, imma go lie down for about... 6 hours
[23:09:06] <rainabba> I've been through about as many paradigm shifts with software development as anyone that didn't start by throwing switches to code binary. Hell, I was programming Assembly to create my own graphics libraries before I even had a real color screen (CGA Amber monochrome on an 8086). Give me a break if I don't use this weeks terminology please.
[23:11:36] <eTiger13> rainabba: http://jsbin.com/aropen/1/edit is better
[23:12:48] <eTiger13> rainabba: i was saying that objects dont have .length. arrays do. parseJSON returns an object, not an array. it may return an object containing arrays though: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsejson/
[23:13:46] <rainabba> Gotcha and thanks for the example code.
[23:14:11] <amirite> yourmama
[23:15:14] <rainabba> eTiger13: This isn't quite right because it's creating a single option element with all my intended ones inside, but otherwise, do you have any feedback on this approach? Just exploring ideas, not to say that I won't use yours.
[23:17:02] <eTiger13> rainabba: i dont know what the json is but yeah. normally I would use a normal for loop but a $.each should work fine
[23:17:54] <ahaaa> Hi all
[23:18:06] <ahaaa> this is a test, 1st time on an IRC
[23:18:13] <warbler> i just cant friggin get this...ugh
[23:18:17] <hateIE> http://jsfiddle.net/ju79Y/21/
[23:20:22] <ahaaa> Need some help...trying to implement a voting(upvote/downvote...reddit like) system using jquery and ajax...backend python. Now I'm ok with the backend part but have no knowledge of jquery and ajax....needed some pointers if I am doing it right
[23:20:41] <ahaaa> ...anyone willing to help me out
[23:20:46] <ahaaa> thanks in advance
[23:21:37] <eTiger13> warbler: you should try removing all the margin and padding on the elements in the scroll pane
[23:24:29] <eTiger13> hateIE: what are you trying to find again?
[23:27:33] <warbler> didnt work eternicode
[23:27:35] <warbler> eTiger13
[23:27:49] <warbler> im extremely novice when it comes to jquery...
[23:28:02] <warbler> ive been at this for 4-5 hours now
[23:28:20] <warbler> so close and im gonna have to scrap the whole damn thing
[23:28:28] <warbler> im out of ideas
[23:29:07] <warbler> yea im scrapping it
[23:34:03] <gavri> I'd like to add a custom request header to all the ajax calls through jquery. is that possible?
[23:35:13] <ravenzz> gavri yes
[23:35:45] <ravenzz> you should read / ask the doc before asking here :)
[23:35:54] <Haprog> gavri: just use $.ajaxSetup() and set the headers property.
[23:36:01] <Haprog> see $.ajax() documentation for details.
[23:36:30] <gavri> ravenzz, Haprog: thanks a lot. I found the headers option for ajax calls, but didn't find this one
[23:36:53] <gavri> this is what I tried https://www.google.co.in/search?q=jquery+include+header+in+all+ajax+calls&oq=jquery+include+header+in+all+ajax+calls&sugexp=chrome,mod=0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[23:37:28] <ravenzz> were you looking for $.ajaxSetup() ?
[23:37:38] <Haprog> ajaxSetup() sets the default values for all future ajax calls
[23:37:49] <gavri> no. I didn't know such a thing existed. I guess that means I should read a jquery book
[23:37:55] <gavri> again, thanks a lot
[23:38:02] <tw2113> gavri
[23:38:04] <ravenzz> wat book
[23:38:06] <Haprog> or just browse the documentaion for the names of existing function
[23:38:09] <Haprog> *functions
[23:38:09] <tw2113> or you could ask in here and read the internet docs
[23:38:12] <Haprog> there aren't that many
[23:38:51] <tw2113> gavri, asking isn't an indication of stupidity
[23:38:57] <ravenzz> read the documentation :) it's fine. Personally I like to have the req definition / handlers all in one place..so I always use $.ajax()
[23:39:03] <gavri> what really happened is that I didn't expect that there would be a way to do this and I thought I would get some hacks here
[23:39:27] <gavri> I'm surprised that this has been enough of a need that it's part of the API
[23:39:45] <tw2113> what? headers for http requests?
[23:39:48] <gavri> if I had suspected this exists in jquery, I would have searched harder
[23:40:10] <gavri> headers for all future ajax requests set in a single function call
[23:40:21] <tw2113> ah
[23:40:32] <tw2113> i never knew about it either, so don't worry so much
[23:40:38] <gavri> again, thanks a lot everyone
[23:40:42] <ravenzz> yw
