[00:04:29] <Rinthe> http://www.webdevout.net/test?02k can someone take a look at this? when i click the button, it's supposed to change the class to liked and the background image should switch to the red heart, but it's not doing it

[00:07:51] <blendedbychris> is there a base64 decoder with javascript?
[00:12:52] <Rinthe> anyone?
[00:14:34] <LukeNukem> eh
[00:14:51] <LukeNukem> an element named arclones is being added to the DOM
[00:15:03] <LukeNukem> how can i check what is adding the element
[00:15:26] <landypro> blendedbychris: https://www.google.com.au/search?&q=is+there+a+base64+decoder+with+javascript%3F
[00:15:46] <blendedbychris> oh okay nothing native
[00:23:32] <ngharo> Validatorian: you could probably grab all json data and markup data into an array then just sort and dump it back out
[00:26:57] <ngharo> Validatorian: something like http://jsfiddle.net/dHQnF/1/
[00:36:04] <Rinthe> http://www.webdevout.net/test?02k can someone take a look at this? when i click the button, it's supposed to change the class to liked and the background image should switch to the red heart, but it's not doing it
[00:39:55] <ngharo> Rinthe: look at your console
[00:40:20] <Rinthe> ngharo: what cnosole?
[00:40:38] <ngharo> ?ftj @ Rinthe
[00:40:39] <bot-t> Rinthe, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[00:41:01] <ngharo> take a look at that, when you figure out how to get to a console, you'll see your script is throwing an error
[00:41:36] <Rinthe> ngharo: ok i have the firebug console up
[00:41:43] <Rinthe> can i test it on the webdevout page?
[00:42:37] <ngharo> Rinthe: http://jsfiddle.net/wfq7d/
[00:42:48] <ngharo> that webdevout seems to mangle jquery
[00:43:35] <Rinthe> ngharo: i dont see any errors in the console
[00:44:20] <ngharo> lies
[00:45:10] <blendedbychris> what would be a good way to reference the "next" video to replace a current video in that videos element? rel="" maybe?
[00:45:12] <Rinthe> ngharo: lol really
[00:45:18] <Rinthe> ngharo: im on chrome btw
[00:45:34] <Rinthe> ngharo: you mean when i click on the heart button in jsfiddle right/
[00:46:16] <ngharo> yep
[00:46:27] <ngharo> Rinthe: ? ? ? ??oauth = post.find( '.reblog' ).attr( 'href' ).slice( -8 ),
[00:46:37] <ngharo> that fails
[00:46:56] <Rinthe> ngharo: yah that stuff fails because i didn't add everything into the html because theyr'e dynamic
[00:47:07] <Rinthe> ngharo: but the adding and removing of class should be working
[00:47:13] <Rinthe> which should switch the image right?
[00:47:47] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/wfq7d/1/
[00:49:09] <Rinthe> ngharo: lol interesting...
[00:49:10] <ngharo> when a script encounters an error it stops executing
[00:49:19] <ngharo> but your real problem was the !important bit
[00:49:24] <ngharo> in css land
[00:50:14] <Rinthe> ngharo: how does the !important part affect this?
[00:51:12] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/wfq7d/4/
[00:51:16] <ngharo> right click on the heart and inspect it
[00:51:24] <ngharo> then click on it, watch the styles on the right side
[00:52:30] <Rinthe> oh whoa
[00:54:49] <Rinthe> ngharo: err still not wokrking :(
[00:54:57] <Rinthe> ngharo: can i pm you a link?

[02:26:34] <astropirate> didn't know there was such a thing as a web technician
[02:26:54] <grifx> astropirate:  ?
[02:27:16] <grifx> but my sentence is correct ?
[02:27:20] <astropirate> grifx, sentence is fine  you don't need a comma though
[02:27:36] <grifx> ok
[02:27:40] <grifx> astropirate: thanks !
[02:27:43] <grifx> :)
[02:27:47] <astropirate> :)
[02:28:00] <astropirate> grifx, did you mean web developer?
[02:28:20] <grifx> i'm a seo, designer and developer
[02:28:23] <astropirate> no one uses the term web technician :p
[02:28:35] <grifx> so i can't use developer
[02:29:01] <Woet> you're a seo?
[02:29:09] <astropirate> :p
[02:29:18] <grifx> ....
[02:29:19] <Woet> as in, you optimize websites for SEO or you use blackhat tools that spam blogs? :p
[02:29:41] <grifx> i optimize websites
[02:30:22] <grifx> i developped a tools to be in first position on google.
[02:30:36] <grifx> but it's a secret
[02:34:57] <fragione> how can I copy the existing click event handler of one element to another?
[03:55:03] <phil-adept> hi all
[03:55:28] <phil-adept> can anyone look at this for me?
[03:55:30] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/PWjU9/1/
[03:56:43] <phil-adept> In Firefox there is a blink, however all is fine in Chrome. I think it's to do with the showSlide() function where it updates the #slide element and then shows() however this only happens in FF. Any ideas why?
[04:06:30] <g0th> hi
[04:06:57] <phil-adept> hi g0th
[04:07:07] <g0th> if I do var el=document.createElement("div"); var el2=document.createElement("div"); el.appendChild(el2); $(el)
[04:07:12] <g0th> what will it select?
[04:07:29] <g0th> just el?
[04:07:54] <phil-adept> yip, IMHO
[04:07:57] <rmurphey> g0th: your browser's development console is a great place to get these answers :)
[04:08:12] <g0th> it always gives way too much information
[04:08:14] <g0th> confuses me
[04:08:25] <g0th> hmm
[04:08:45] <phil-adept> g0th: This might help.

[04:10:07] <phil-adept> in fact rmurphey's link is a much better resource :)
[04:10:19] <phil-adept> has anyone looked at my issue?
[04:10:28] <g0th> yeah nice
[04:10:33] <g0th> but not really helping :(
[04:10:41] <g0th> anyway
[04:11:02] <g0th> for some strange reason one el2 does not appear in my dom after I appended el
[04:11:04] <phil-adept> g0th: consoloe.log( $(el) ); will help
[04:11:08] <g0th> (another problem)
[04:11:19] <phil-adept> jsfiddle?
[04:11:26] <phil-adept> show us and we might be able to help :D
[04:11:29] <rmurphey> phil-adept: i looked at it last night and didn't see anything immediately ... have you looked at how existing slideshow plugins do it?
[04:11:36] <g0th> http://pastebin.com/qyquUCgK
[04:12:13] <rmurphey> g0th: are you appending el to the dom at any point?
[04:12:14] <delimax> hey fellows - is it possible to bind a keydown callback to an html5 canvas element?
[04:12:49] <g0th> I append bar to a container which I append to the dom
[04:13:04] <g0th>       barInterface.appendChild(bar);
[04:13:19] <rmurphey> ok, that's not in your pastebin
[04:13:27] <rmurphey> can you create a jsfiddle that shows the problem?
[04:13:53] <rmurphey> (fyi i am on a plane so i will lose internet here in a bit)
[04:14:00] <g0th> document.getElementById(self.config.interfaceId).appendChild(self._barInterface);
[04:14:08] <g0th> wow ^^
[04:14:25] <g0th> I just add the whole file
[04:14:50] <rmurphey> g0th: the best way for people to help is if you can create a jsfiddle -- not a pastebin -- that shows the essential problem
[04:14:55] <rmurphey> http://jsfiddle.net/
[04:15:19] <g0th> http://jsfiddle.net/7LLen/
[04:15:34] <rmurphey> the *essential* problem
[04:15:38] <rmurphey> not all your code :)
[04:16:09] <g0th> ok, I try to debug it myself ^^
[04:16:26] <g0th> there is no obvious mistake right?
[04:16:35] <g0th> so I just have to go step by step
[04:16:37] <rmurphey> i'd have to read through a couple of hundred lines to find out
[04:16:52] <rmurphey> i *strongly* suggest you pause and read fixing these jquery
[04:16:57] <rmurphey> it will teach you a lot about debugging
[04:17:12] <g0th> read fixing these jquery

[04:32:48] <rmurphey> g0th: probably my biggest recommendation is to reduce your problem to the simplest thing that still fails
[04:32:51] <g0th> omg, wtf
[04:32:59] <rmurphey> often in the course of that reduction, you'll figure out the issue :)

[04:42:43] <g0th> sorry, ui I mean
[04:44:49] <g0th> oh "selectable"
[04:54:28] <g0th> how do selectable and draggable work together?
[04:54:38] <g0th> I cannot select it seems since it immediately tries to drag
[05:03:59] <behelit> hi guys. there are a million plugins for modal windows out there... which one is most solid? :)
[05:06:15] <shesek> jQuery UI's ?
[05:07:18] <behelit> shesek: that felt so bloated. will give it another eye.
[05:11:39] <Ix-Xitan> can anyone tell me the difference between $.ajax({type:'GET',url: .... and $.get('url', { params... ?
[05:12:13] <behelit> Ix-Xitan: $.get is a shortcut that sets some default values for $.ajax
[05:12:46] <Ix-Xitan> so in the end $.get is translated to the other i suppose
[05:14:03] <Ix-Xitan> ahh ok like timeout , datatype i guess
[05:16:18] <shesek> rmurphey, oh, hey. I remember you having a neat blog, if I'm not mistaking
[05:18:08] <phil-adept> can anyone help with an issue I have?
[05:18:19] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/PWjU9/1/
[05:18:35] <phil-adept> In firefox the slide jumps. It's ok in other browsers though, any suggestions?
[05:19:10] <rmurphey> phil-adept: when i was looking at it yesterday, it was "jumping" in chrome as well
[05:19:36] <erebel55> morning
[05:19:50] <erebel55> right now i'm using something like this to zoom my svg
[05:19:56] <erebel55> $('#main_group').attr('transform', 'translate(0,0) scale(' + scale + ',' + scale + ')');
[05:20:03] <erebel55> but what if i want to zoom to a point that is centered in the middle of the div instead?
[05:22:40] <phil-adept> rmurphey: It's fine in chrome on mine? and that's on an old laptop on xp. Tried it on my workstation today as I thought it may hev been due to rendering on a slow machine however in chrome it's fine, FF its not. I've chained the animations correctly, it's doing my friggin nut in. I'm trying to find the issue and fix it rather than choose another implimentation
[05:23:01] <phil-adept> erebel: mnove the element you're zooming?
[05:23:26] <phil-adept> if you scale it will always scale from the origin, so you need to move the image by the same ratio / scale
[05:24:46] <phil-adept> ie, image of 100px x 100px the center will be (50, 50). If you double it's size, the center is now (100, 100) so you will need to move your image by (-50,-50) to be centered in your viewport
[05:24:55] <Druid_> lol: http://apina.biz/63766
[05:25:18] <phil-adept> rmurphey: I am right in what I have done though aren't I?.... There isn't anything wrong with my code?
[05:25:27] <erebel55> ahh ok thanks for explaining that so nicely phil-adept :)
[05:25:46] <phil-adept> erebel55: Hope it helps :_
[05:25:48] <phil-adept> :)
[05:29:40] <erebel55> translate(' + -width/scale + ',' + -height/scale +')
[05:29:47] <erebel55> something like that then i think
[05:30:27] <phil-adept> yeah something like that should work. I assume the element in question is within a viewport?
[05:31:58] <zim> Hi all. if I have an element e.g. <div id="foo" data-a="A" data-b="B"> is there a way to use .data to get all rather that $(this).data('a') and $(this).data('b') ?
[05:32:04] <erebel55> it's within a div
[05:36:56] <zim> OK some usage my help I would like to post all data-* so in my last example I want to post a=A and b=B
[05:37:08] <zim> s/my/may
[05:39:05] <zim> without having to var A = $(this).data('a'); first. I would like to build an array will all the data elements regardless of what they are.
[05:41:58] <rmurphey> zim: http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[05:42:30] <rmurphey> you can just call .data()
[05:42:53] <rmurphey> (as of jquery 1.4)
[05:46:43] <erebel55> my attempt to center the zoom like phil said seems to have failed

[05:49:23] <FranciscoD> hello
[05:49:43] <FranciscoD> are there any known issues between firefox 11 and jquery ?
[05:49:49] <FranciscoD> Is there a page on this?
[05:55:04] <rmurphey> FranciscoD: your best bet is probably the bug tracker
[05:55:10] <rmurphey> is there a specific issue you're having?
[05:55:22] <FranciscoD> rmurphey: nah, not yet. Just wanted the page bookmarked :)
[05:55:29] <FranciscoD> I'll look at the tracker, thanks
[05:56:01] <phil-adept> rmurphey: looking at other plugins at the mo as you suggested. Most don't use this method (I wonder why!!) and they tend to stack all images on top of each otehr and fade between rather than using only 2 elements (primary & cloned)
[05:56:14] <rmurphey> phil-adept: yeah i think that is more typical :)
[05:56:33] <phil-adept> I am however the kinda perdson that doesn't like to admit defeat... GRrr
[05:57:47] <rmurphey> you may want to try focusing on writing a function that transitions between two elements
[05:57:55] <rmurphey> get that working, and then hook it up with your actual images/dom
[05:58:12] <rmurphey> that is, isolate the part you're ahving a hard time iwth
[05:59:58] <phil-adept> rmurphey: I have, that is the jsfiddle. It's part of a bigger application, however on it's simplest scale, it demonstrates this bizarre behaviour
[06:00:18] <phil-adept> i.e. function showSlide()
[06:00:36] <phil-adept> or havr I missunderstood you?
[06:00:58] <rmurphey> i'm saying make it even simpler than that
[06:01:12] <rmurphey> function switchBetween(elementA, elementB) { ... }
[06:01:41] <phil-adept> getcha. So break that function down into smaller ones and focus on the culprit?
[06:02:25] <erebel55> phil-adept: do this look broken? I tried the zoom like you suggested. http://jsfiddle.net/erebel55/pwjSG/34/
[06:03:13] <phil-adept> erebel55: Sorry fella, I have a few issues of my own I have to get sorted. If I have time later I could take a look for you however at the moment I've 3 projects I need to finish today :(
[06:04:11] <erebel55> ahh okay no problem. I understand :) thanks for your help tho.
[06:04:15] <erebel55> good luck with your projects
[06:04:30] <phil-adept> cheers, I need it, as well as 50 hour days :(
[06:06:06] <feelfree82> Please take a look at my map-api integration code - http://pastebin.com/WZKzsRBS - Any idea why it is not showing me the alert?
[06:07:38] <WesleyL> json returns an object so it's var conditions = parsed_json.conditions;
[06:07:41] <WesleyL> same goes for the date

[06:16:31] <g0th> hi
[06:17:03] <g0th> I'd like to select elements and drag the select elements around, how does this work with jquery's draggable and selectable ui?
[06:17:47] <g0th> if something is draggable how do I select it?
[06:17:49] <g0th> and vice-versa
[06:25:59] <phil-adept> g0th: have you tried using them together to see if there are issues?
[06:26:23] <phil-adept> Failing that: http://www.ryancoughlin.com/2008/11/23/combining-selectables-and-draggables-using-jquery-ui/
[06:28:04] <phil-adept> g0th: I tend to assume too much. Especially 2nd guessing problems before I encounter them. Sometimes it's best to keep them concerns in the back of your mind and try things anyway as it could have been considered at the time jQuery was last revised and it may not be as much of a concern as you think. It might work straight away ( I hope it does!)
[06:28:21] <phil-adept> if not ask away and I'm sure someone will help :D
[06:28:39] <beancurd> actually he's been asking for the last 24 hours.
[06:31:24] <phil-adept> eh?
[06:31:47] <melkornemesis> hi guys, https://gist.github.com/638bd7c84101af0df217 .. can someone help me? i have set 'dataType: "json"', but console.log(data) returns a string, not an json object http://d.pr/cx69+
[06:32:38] <melkornemesis> i dont see any error in the returned string, but eval(data) says "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :"
[06:33:24] <phil-adept> is service.php returning JSON back? Are you using echo json_encode();?
[06:33:47] <phil-adept> by default it won't, it will be probably be html
[06:34:06] <melkornemesis> phil-adept: i am, but sorry for now, it somehow get's to work :X
[06:34:30] <melkornemesis> i didn't do anything and it's fixed now, sorry for bothering
[06:34:34] <phil-adept> no worries :D
[06:35:58] <feelfree82> WesleyL > http://pastebin.com/hD7W6g5K script debugger says conditions var :undefined
[06:37:48] <g0th> phil-adept: yes, I tried it and it is always dragging the elements
[06:38:04] <WesleyL> feelfree82: look closer at the json
[06:38:15] <WesleyL> you don't seem to be using the propel variables
[06:38:19] <Morthez> Hi
[06:38:27] <feelfree82> WesleyL > ok
[06:40:39] <Morthez> I'm trying to get a simple counter to count down from 10 to 0, but i can't get it to work.. ---- for (var i=10; i=0; i--) $('#countdown').delay(1000).val(i);
[06:40:55] <phil-adept> (var i=10; i>0; i--)
[06:40:59] <g0th> phil-adept: also the "should" be behaviour is not so clear to me either, I have some ideas but I was wondering if someone already thought about it
[06:41:15] <phil-adept> g0th: Did you see the link I posted?
[06:41:23] <phil-adept> http://www.ryancoughlin.com/2008/11/23/combining-selectables-and-draggables-using-jquery-ui/
[06:41:44] <Morthez> phil-adept: the value of the div still does not is not getting set, or updated..
[06:42:09] <g0th> yes
[06:42:11] <WesleyL> feelfree82: try console.log(parsed_json) en look at it in for example the chrome web inspector, it lets you browse the object then, might help
[06:43:41] <phil-adept> Morthez: break it down. See if its your counter that's failing or the timeout, or the .val() updates. use console.log() and your console to debug each area and work from there
[06:45:29] <sebastiandeutsch> Hi, today I started to work on a legacy app. If I want to update to the latest version of jQuery it will use the new handlers "on" instead of "click" is there a small snippet that bridges that behavior? I don't want to rewrite the whole app.
[06:45:55] <g0th>           $(this).is(".ui-selected") || $(".ui-selected").removeClass("ui-selected");
[06:45:59] <g0th> I don't get this
[06:46:22] <g0th> phil-adept: from your link that is
[06:47:36] <Morthez> is there a sleep or wait function in javascript that i can use?
[06:47:52] <melkornemesis> setTimeout()
[06:47:55] <phil-adept> g0th: It explains on that page... "This next section above resets the select and drag, by removing the ui-selected class, when we output using console.log, to see the value of this is The value of ‘this’ currently is: [object HTMLDivElement]."
[06:49:54] <feelfree82> WesleyL > Looking at the property inspector... it shows me the returned data . var conditions = parsed_json.forecast; is wrong
[06:51:04] <Morthez> It won't wait for the timeout to occur.. :s
[06:51:13] <Morthez> setTimeout("$('#countdown').delay(1000).val(i);", 1000)
[06:51:50] <g0th> why does it do  $(this).is(".ui-selected") ?
[06:52:33] <g0th> hmm it only reset when we are dragging something that is selected?
[06:52:42] <g0th> that makes sense maybe
[06:53:06] <melkornemesis> Morthez: what are you trying to do?
[06:55:32] <Morthez> melkornemesis: I'm trying to update the value of a div (#countdown) every second from 10 -> 0.
[06:57:44] <melkornemesis> Morthez: try to
[06:57:44] <melkornemesis> for (var i = 10; i <= 0; i—) {
[06:57:44] <melkornemesis> setTimeout("$('#countdown').delay(1000).val(i);", 1000)
[06:57:44] <melkornemesis> }
[07:02:40] <Morthez> melkornemesis: still same result, nothing happens, and if i put console.log(i) in there, it puts out the 10-0 within milliseconds..
[07:02:43] <nmee> Hi, I have played around with the Chosen JQ plugin for making select boxes more user friendly. However, for my current application, the user usually wants to select 10-20 different options. Holding CTRL and clicking each item in a regular multi-select input is much more efficient than using Chosen for this application - but are there any other, similar components that alleviates this problem?
[07:03:57] <Morthez> melkornemesis: acctualy, with console.log nothing happens either..
[07:06:10] <ei2matrix> Hi guys, question, I did an uploadify uploader and it works great on my localhost (windows), now, when I upload my files to live server (Linux) I'm getting error 406 when try to upload the file. Som ideas?
[07:07:10] <phil-adept> whats the quickest way of finding the position of an element in a list with a specific class applied? ie, i want to find the position of the <li> that has the class "current" within it's <ul>
[07:07:37] <phil-adept> ei2matrix: I had a few uploadify issues the other week. What's error 406?
[07:08:36] <phil-adept> melkornemesis: i less than or eqal to 0?...
[07:08:49] <phil-adept> >
[07:08:49] <phil-adept> >= sorry
[07:11:57] <phil-adept> rather it's index, not position
[07:16:56] <ei2matrix> phil-adept: yes, 406
[07:18:16] <ei2matrix> I researched this and appearently is something with headers... but some time ago it worked fine...
[07:19:01] <xec> melkornemesis, Morthez: pass a function to setTimeout, like setTimeout(function(){ /* do stuff*/ }, 1000);
[07:19:02] <phil-adept> that a http repsonse code from your server or is that an uploadify error
[07:19:13] <phil-adept> is that*
[07:23:10] <Morthez> xec: The value still is not updated.. :-s
[07:23:39] <xec> i only read the last couple comments, what are you trying to achieve?
[07:24:21] <Morthez> I'm trying to make a counter to countdown from 10 sec to 0.
[07:29:48] <xec> Morthez: http://jsfiddle.net/9e5s7/1/
[07:30:01] <fris> im using getjson to get data from github api, anyone know how i can sort by one of the keys? (instead of alpha wanna sort by latest updated) http://jsfiddle.net/PqAvY/
[07:31:49] <xec> Morthez: it's not going to be 100% accurate though
[07:32:04] <Morthez> xec: thanks!
[07:32:35] <Morthez> The accuary is not important. Just to show the user that he has to take another action within 10 seconds.
[07:33:19] <minna> Hello
[07:35:40] <impulse9> hi; how would i go about delaying a mouseover event?
[07:35:56] <minna> I'm trying to use yepnope to initate a jQuery plugin from within the page, but the page-plugin load before the main plugin does. How can i fix that?
[07:36:00] <minna> impulse9: .delay()
[07:36:28] <impulse9> $(this).delay(800).mouseover(function() { ... ?
[07:36:48] <impulse9> i already tried a lot of variantions with delay but none of them seems to do the job
[07:36:57] <xec> minna, impulse9: .delay() is only for animation queues
[07:37:16] <xec> ?hoverIntent
[07:37:19] <impulse9> and this explains why they don't do the job
[07:37:20] <impulse9> :>
[07:37:21] <bot-t> xec, hoverIntent - Plugins - jQuery - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
[07:37:39] <impulse9> is there a pluginless version ?
[07:37:48] <impulse9> i really don't want to mess up my code for something as trivial as this
[07:38:09] <xec> just take a look at the code http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-dotimeout/examples/hoverintent/
[07:38:14] <minna> Hm, that's true, hoverintent is the most suitable
[07:38:35] <impulse9> thanks
[07:38:36] <xec> doTimeout is another plugin, though
[07:38:39] <impulse9> this will do the job i think
[07:38:48] <xec> but it's relatively simple

[09:21:20] <Silne30> Hello. I am trying to run a simple jQuery statement to familiarize myself with it. I run some code in jsfiddle and it works. but it does not when it reaches the browser.
[09:22:39] <Jon47> Silne30 any chance we can see your code?  it's probably really easy to fix if we can just see the problem, but if it's on your local machine, there's not much we can do without more info
[09:23:18] <Silne30> http://jsfiddle.net/VAuq8/6/
[09:23:30] <lenswipe> can someone help me out here?
[09:24:36] <Jon47> Silne30: can you use dev tools or something to make sure that the scripts are being loaded correctly?
[09:25:00] <Jon47> if you haven't got jquery located in the scripts dir relative to that html file, it won't load..
[09:25:03] <Silne30> I was looking to download them. I'm using chrome.
[09:25:10] <Silne30> It is.
[09:25:33] <Jon47> chrome comes with dev tools, View -> Developer -> Developer Tools
[09:27:02] <Silne30> When I got to the scripts tab and click the dropdown, only my jQuery script is present.
[09:29:43] <Silne30> I fixed it. I didn't know you couldn't use a self closing tag for script.
[09:29:48] <Silne30> New to JS.
[09:30:21] <Silne30> I noticed that my second script was included in the jQuery scripts element.
[09:34:07] <Silne30> Thanks for your help Jon47.
[09:34:14] <Silne30> Those dev tools are awesome.
[09:34:35] <Jon47> Silne30 just teachin a man to fish ;)
[09:34:39] <Jon47> yeah chrome dev tools are my fav
[09:34:44] <Jon47> they are getting better all the time too
[09:35:04] <Jon47> Firebug is also really good if you're using Firefox, and Opera's Dragonfly seems legit
[09:35:10] <Silne30> Cool.
[09:35:18] <Jon47> IE has some built-in dev tools as well but they are a lot more painful to use
[09:35:35] <Silne30> I definitely just like being pointed in the right direction , vs. being fed code.
[09:35:44] <Silne30> Do all of these browsers coe with the plugins included.
[09:35:54] <Silne30> come*
[09:37:11] <Silne30> jQuery is crazy. I had no idea it was so dev friendly. Was trying to do a lot of these things by css and it was a bit cumbersome.
[09:37:20] <Silne30> I just need to work on implementing it with ASP.NET.

[09:52:38] <ajpiano> here or ##javascript

[09:53:35] <Validatorian> ajpiano: I've asked several times, starting from yesterday, and haven't had anyone respond to my question thus far
[09:53:43] <Validatorian> I'm having some trouble figuring out the proper way to inject new posts into an existing set of posts based on a timestamp -- It should be pretty simple, I'm just not able to wrap my head around it. http://jsfiddle.net/KujHt/5/ - I'd really appreciate some help.
[09:53:48] <fhil> What's the question?
[09:54:49] <fhil> Ok. I get the link. What's the specifics of the problem?
[09:54:50] <Validatorian> the loops were done with $(selector).each() previously, I converted them to minimize scope issues
[09:55:08] <ajpiano> Validatorian: why wouldn't you use array.sort
[09:56:14] <ajpiano> put all the content into the array and then just sort it by epoch time
[09:56:15] <Validatorian> so you suggest I merge the newPosts and existingPosts into one array and sort there, then output them all?
[09:56:21] <ajpiano> yep
[09:56:42] <Validatorian> well, the existing posts are considerably more complex than what I put there for the test data (this is for injecting into a g+ stream)
[09:56:55] <Validatorian> I'm concerned about taking them out of the DOM and putting them back in
[09:57:27] <ajpiano> if they all have timestamps, then the other complexity should be irrelevant
[09:57:28] <Validatorian> from previous tests, that not only slowed things down quite a bit, but also broke some functionality within the google code
[09:57:46] <ajpiano> and if you inject them all back in in a single move then it shouldn't be a heavy burden from a perf standpoint
[09:58:51] <ngharo> Validatorian: i linked you a fiddle using sort yesterday
[09:58:59] <ajpiano> Validatorian: you could make a separate array of *only* the timestamps, sort that, and then use it to control the order when you're reshuffling the posts
[09:59:27] <Validatorian> ngharo: must have missed it, sorry about that -- would you mind resending the link?
[10:01:18] <ngharo> Validatorian: http://jsfiddle.net/dHQnF/2/
[10:02:05] <Validatorian> ahh
[10:02:07] <Validatorian> that makes sense
[10:02:17] <ajpiano> yep
[10:02:22] <ajpiano> that's the exact thing i was suggestin
[10:02:22] <Validatorian> really unfortunate that I missed it the first time around :-P
[10:02:46] <Validatorian> thank you very much ngharo, and you too ajpiano
[10:03:58] <fhil> if your posts are already in the DOM, why not use jquery filter to find your post and then append your new post with .after()
[10:04:45] <Validatorian> that's what I was doing originally, wasn't I?
[10:05:05] <Validatorian> postAfter.after(this.content);
[10:05:55] <fhil> Sorry, maybe I missed the issue. Why is a separate array needed then?
[10:08:55] <Validatorian> my logic is just wrong
[10:09:03] <DrChandra> i have a small problem, i am writing text with .html() inside a div, which has overflow set to scrolling... however, when doing that the scrollbar is about in the middle when the page loads... however i would like the scrollbar to be at the start... i tried with .scrollTop() but it does not seem to work.. what can i do?
[10:16:17] <sodapop> hi, when i use a custom theme and a slider with range attribute (min) the left edge of the slider is not shown (using the latest version of jquery and ui), any idea?
[10:24:14] <fhil> DrChandra, try to use jsfidle.
[10:26:09] <DrChandra> fhil: i found the problem... i called scrollTop before the div was becoming visible (was being opened in a dialog)
[10:37:14] <bigorangesu> hello
[10:37:46] <bigorangesu> i was wondering if anyone had any input into jquery templating and why the plugin was no longer being maintained
[10:51:21] <Validatorian> ngharo: one issue -- I need to keep the container attributes (id and class, specifically) of existingPosts --   currently, it's getting rid of the container <p> stuff as it's just using .html() - I could use .wrap() but I'm wondering if there's not a better way? http://jsfiddle.net/dHQnF/3/ (just added id an classes)
[10:59:37] <Validatorian> ajpiano, perhaps you know of a better method?
[11:00:54] <ajpiano> Validatorian: yeah
[11:01:11] <ajpiano> you should take a different approach wheree you actually push new elements into the existing jquery set
[11:01:14] <ajpiano> and then call sort on that
[11:01:29] <ajpiano> cause that's undocumented but it works
[11:02:04] <Validatorian> that is what I would prefer
[11:02:57] <Validatorian> but that's where I started from, still not clear on the logic for inserting -- the only ideas I have are extremely inefficient
[11:02:58] <ajpiano> i can sketch it out hm
[11:03:09] <Validatorian> I would really appreciate that.
[11:10:06] <ajpiano> Validatorian: http://jsfiddle.net/KujHt/10/
[11:10:12] <ajpiano> ok now i really have to pack for this trip though :p

[12:30:15] <lenswipe> can someone help me out?
[12:30:32] <lenswipe> im creating new elements and the buttons dont work so i think i need to use bind() but im not sure where it should go

[12:34:09] <CKIDOW> hi everyone
[12:34:23] <CKIDOW> i have a question regarding .show() and easing effect
[12:34:52] <CKIDOW> how can I disable any easing effect?
[12:35:32] <CKIDOW> https://gist.github.com/2277993
[12:35:47] <CKIDOW> passing "false" didn't do the trick
[12:36:32] <CKIDOW> any suggestions?
[12:37:01] <CKIDOW> my values at "easing" are totally ignored
[12:37:20] <CKIDOW> if I pass "linear" or "swing" the effect is the same
[12:37:36] <CKIDOW> thx in advance
[12:42:08] <shoky> uhm.. remove the duration?
[12:43:11] <creative__> hey guys
[12:47:56] <xec> CKIDOW: what shoky says, set the duration to 0
[12:48:05] <CKIDOW> okay
[12:48:07] <CKIDOW> i did
[12:48:16] <CKIDOW> i guess i missunderstood the easing
[12:49:00] <CKIDOW> but now I know
[12:49:03] <CKIDOW> so thx guys
[12:49:06] <CKIDOW> anyway
[12:49:07] <CKIDOW> :)
[12:49:43] <creative__> can somebody help me with jquery accordion??

[12:50:41] <bot-t> creative__, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:53:07] <fhil> Guys, those of you who make the effort to answer questions. Thanks.
[12:54:08] <creative__> sorry
[12:54:19] <creative__> i have a problem with jquery accordion
[12:54:42] <creative__> http://demo12.creativestudio.ie/faq/
[12:54:57] <creative__> it's like 'flash of unstyled content'
[12:55:14] <creative__> the FAQ questions open while the page loads and then they close again
[12:55:21] <creative__> i would love if they could stay closed while loading
[12:55:28] <creative__> im not sure if there is a setting in jquery accordion
[12:55:34] <creative__> i've been looking all over for it
[12:55:39] <creative__> trying different things
[12:55:40] <creative__> no luck
[12:56:46] <lenswipe> somone?
[12:57:22] <shoky> lenswipe your question is far from clear
[12:57:43] <shoky> d'0h the buttons dont work so i think so im not sure d'0h.
[13:00:36] <lenswipe> well i create some elements with jquery, are you with me so far?
[13:03:41] <lenswipe> the elements have buttons in them and the buttons dont work when the elements are created
[13:03:50] <lenswipe> someone in here suggested i needed to use bind()
[13:04:02] <lenswipe> not sure how though shoky
[13:04:22] <shoky> first of all, use on() not bind()
[13:04:28] <lenswipe> ...ok
[13:04:35] <lenswipe> same syntax as bind?
[13:04:38] <lenswipe> and where does it go?
[13:04:42] <lenswipe> inside my click button?
[13:04:50] <shoky> similar syntax ya
[13:04:58] <shoky> it goes where you want to set the event handler
[13:05:23] <shoky> 'the buttons dont work' doesnt say anything to me
[13:05:36] <lenswipe> $('.remove').click(function(){
[13:05:36] <lenswipe>         $(this).parent().remove();
[13:05:36] <lenswipe>     });
[13:05:39] <lenswipe> in there?
[13:06:04] <jkoudys> Any idea how to (simply) get a jcarousel to display the images to the left and right of the current one, like this site does? http://www.fiulabash2012.com/
[13:06:14] <shoky> lenswipe that is already setting a click handler..
[13:06:34] <shoky> .click is like using .bind
[13:06:54] <lenswipe> two seconds
[13:06:54] <jkoudys> If I could just get jcarousel to preload everything like it's cycled through my images once that would work.. any ideas how?
[13:09:32] <gabeodess> has anyone else noticed that $('input').focus() does not seem to be working in Chrome?
[13:10:03] <shoky> nope
[13:10:20] <gabeodess> shoky: it works for you?
[13:10:33] <gabeodess> I can't get it to automatically focus on the input
[13:12:02] <creative__> anyone able to help?
[13:12:16] <creative__> i appreciate it's not the most straight forward of problems
[13:12:44] <lenswipe> shoky, well i would love to show you the code but i cant find it - yet it continues to work....
[13:12:45] <lenswipe> ...wtf?
[13:12:53] <xec> creative__: i'm not 100% sure how to solve it using accordion, but it doesn't look like you need it?
[13:13:07] <shoky> gabeodess, http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5SshY/
[13:13:26] <shoky> lenswipe, what?
[13:13:39] <xec> creative__: you're simply opening and closing the questions, accordion is meant for having 1 open at a time. it should be really easy to create this without accordion
[13:13:55] <lenswipe> shoky, i want to show you the code i want help with but it seems not to exist but continues to work
[13:13:58] <lenswipe> im having a wtf moment
[13:14:09] <shoky> alright ;p
[13:14:19] <shoky> i'll go eat in the meanwhile
[13:15:24] <creative__> xec.. you are right
[13:15:26] <creative__> wtf am i doing
[13:15:39] <creative__> i'll go have a look online for this type of function in html
[13:16:01] <creative__> thanks
[13:16:30] <xec> creative__: http://jsfiddle.net/UWZDm/
[13:17:27] <xec> creative__: there is html5 elements that do this to, but browser support is pretty weak, so i'd recommend you stick to javascript for hiding/showing behaviour for now
[13:17:32] <xec> there are*
[13:17:39] <xec> too*
[13:17:44] <xec> i must be tired
[13:18:44] <gabeodess> shoky: interesting.  When I copy that document into its own page and run it it focuses fine.  but then if I try calling the same code from Chrome's console, it will not focus.
[13:19:28] <xec> creative__: anyway, the point i was trying to make with the demo is that if you set the css to hide the elements you don't get the fouc
[13:19:33] <gabeodess> shoky: calling $('input').focus() from the console will trigger the focus callbacks, but doesn't actually focus on the input.  only seems to work on doc ready.
[13:19:44] <shoky> is it the only input tag?
[13:19:55] <gabeodess> shoky: yessir
[13:21:10] <creative__> xec
[13:21:13] <creative__> thank you
[13:21:24] <creative__> do you know any good js examples for this online?
[13:22:23] <xec> i just made one, didnt you see the link?
[13:22:41] <shoky> gabeodess, prolly coz the chrome console steals the focus...
[13:22:56] <gabeodess> shoky: yeah, I was just thinking that
[13:23:05] <creative__> ah yes, sorry
[13:23:19] <gabeodess> shoky: I'll have to do some more testing.
[13:23:27] <creative__> this js section in the example, i can drop this into any js file that gets loaded in the header, right?
[13:23:48] <xec> creative__: as long as jquery is loaded first, yes
[13:24:00] <shoky> gabeodess, if you make a button call the .focus() on the input it'll work..
[13:24:34] <gabeodess> shoky: cool, thanks for talking through this with me.
[13:24:44] <shoky> np
[13:25:01] <shoky> gabeodess, anyway it's better that you don't use 'input' as the selector
[13:25:03] <creative__> cool im going to try this
[13:25:11] <shoky> put an id on the input you wanna focus
[13:25:12] <creative__> do you mind if i idle in this room while i do it?
[13:25:20] <shoky> no you must not idle!
[13:25:26] <shoky> all 868 people here are active
[13:25:26] <creative__> lol oops
[13:25:27] <creative__> ok
[13:25:31] <creative__> lol shoky
[13:25:32] <gabeodess> shoky: yeah, I was just using that to simplify the example.
[13:25:32] <creative__> ;)
[13:25:45] <shoky> gabeodess aight
[13:26:25] <shoky> creative__ has been idle 47secs

[14:09:50] <Prasoon> can any pne help me?
[14:11:09] <Eviltwin> I don't believe what you are asking can be accomplished with jQuery
[14:11:15] <Eviltwin> I would suggest trying ##php
[14:16:59] <Silne30> I am looking through the jQuery documentation. I am finding that I am trying to show a div named wrapper that's hidden by at document.ready
[14:17:04] <Silne30> but it's not showing up.
[14:18:20] <_zoggy_> $(#foo).show()
[14:18:45] <_zoggy_> jquery 1.7.2 is out. plz update topic
[14:18:52] <_zoggy_> jqueryui.com says 1.7.3 is latest. goof?
[14:20:40] <hurdos> Hello
[14:20:52] <hurdos> How handle a click event on dynamic created element?
[14:21:36] <Eviltwin> _zoggy_: Where?
[14:22:14] <_zoggy_> Eviltwin, on front page
[14:22:33] <Eviltwin> Where does it say that jQuery 1.7.3 is the lastest?
[14:23:11] <_zoggy_> unless the 'Legacy' line is really about jui not jquery
[14:23:19] <Eviltwin> It is about jQuery UI
[14:23:36] <_zoggy_> yeah, just misleading due to where we are at with jquery numbering
[14:23:51] <_zoggy_> so ignore that :)
[14:24:18] <Eviltwin> You're right, we should probably change the version numbers of jQuery because you might confuse version numbers with something else that's uses the same numbering system
[14:25:36] <_zoggy_> its fine, just saw it at a quick glance. relax
[14:27:02] <Eviltwin> We'd just like to discourage people from reporting problems that aren't actually problems.
[14:28:26] <Silne30> _zoggy_ that's what I did. But maybe my css is off.
[14:41:03] <endberg> hi.
[14:41:34] <endberg> Id like to change a specific div-s class inside a specific list item. http://jsfiddle.net/Q7xBG/1/
[14:41:42] <endberg> but its not working :(
[14:43:48] <BinaryKitten> evening endberg lets look
[14:46:21] <BinaryKitten> endberg what's not working exactly?
[14:47:11] <endberg> BinaryKitten: Im using it in a widgets code, and it not changes the class from unselected to selected
[14:47:48] <BinaryKitten> sorry endberg
[14:48:05] <BinaryKitten> i don't see widget code in that fiddle
[14:48:08] <endberg> BinaryKitten: its ok. so Im using it in a widgets code, and it not changes the class from unselected to selected
[14:48:12] <BinaryKitten> the code in the fiddle works
[14:50:25] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/n9qykztV
[14:50:27] <lenswipe> i have that code
[14:50:40] <lenswipe> when the onclick is fired it creates elements with non-working buttons
[14:50:50] <lenswipe> someone suggested bind() and someone suggested on()
[14:50:53] <lenswipe> and im really confused
[14:51:00] <lenswipe> can someone please clear this up once and for all?
[14:51:26] <BinaryKitten> lenswipe bind was the original event binding function
[14:51:41] <BinaryKitten> .click(fn) = .bind('click', fn)
[14:51:52] <BinaryKitten> now, in 1.7+ there is .on
[14:52:06] <BinaryKitten> .on is a replacement for bind, delegate and live
[14:52:23] <endberg> BinaryKitten: no its not really, look, I change the css to simple background color, and you can see, the red (unselected) is not changing. http://jsfiddle.net/Q7xBG/1/
[14:53:17] <BinaryKitten> lenswipe: if you're adding buttons you need to use .on in delegate mode
[14:53:38] <BinaryKitten> eg parentElement.on('click', '.remove', function() {});
[14:54:09] <BinaryKitten> which basically means when a user clicks on an item with the class .remove inside the parent item run this function
[14:54:51] <BinaryKitten> endberg: I'm not understanding you at all. I see 2 items with class cItem. After the js executes the 1st one has the class selected and has a big black border
[14:55:38] <BinaryKitten> endberg: i don't see any item with the class "unselected" or anything red
[14:55:48] <endberg> BinaryKitten: oh crap, sorry, I forgot to update the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7xBG/17/
[14:56:19] <BinaryKitten> endberg: you should create a new fiddle for this
[14:56:32] <BinaryKitten> rather than use the existing and "updating"
[14:56:38] <BinaryKitten> it's completely different code
[14:56:39] <BinaryKitten> anyway
[14:58:46] <piede> hi, has anyone experience with WAC widgets?
[14:59:20] <endberg> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/h3THP/

[15:01:05] <BinaryKitten> that image tag is breaking html
[15:01:36] <BinaryKitten> 2) urmm let me recheck
[15:03:11] <endberg> BinaryKitten: ok, thats a typo, but in the original source, its correct, but still not working, http://jsfiddle.net/h3THP/1/
[15:03:19] <piede> I am writing an app for Bada 2.0 and I am using WAC apis...i could really use some help :)
[15:03:22] <BinaryKitten> yep
[15:03:26] <BinaryKitten> 2nd issue
[15:03:33] <BinaryKitten> .children is for only direct children
[15:05:03] <endberg> BinaryKitten: is there a way to make that class change?
[15:05:24] <BinaryKitten> endberg trying for you
[15:08:17] <Hypah> what is the best way to go about crossdomain POST requests?
[15:08:49] <Eviltwin> Hypah: A <form>
[15:09:07] <BinaryKitten> endberg http://jsfiddle.net/h3THP/2/
[15:09:10] <BinaryKitten> that seems to work
[15:09:27] <BinaryKitten> hey Davey
[15:09:49] <Davey> Hola BinaryKitten  :)
[15:09:50] <endberg> BinaryKitten: thank you very much!
[15:09:53] <lenswipe> anyone?
[15:09:58] <lenswipe> oh sorry BinaryKitten
[15:10:22] <lenswipe> BinaryKitten, so how do i use .on?
[15:10:34] <BinaryKitten> just like i described
[15:10:41] <BinaryKitten> eg parentElement.on('click', '.remove', function() {});
[15:10:50] <BinaryKitten> before the code that adds the items
[15:11:01] <lenswipe> ok
[15:11:12] <lenswipe> so how do i add that to the code i already have?
[15:11:19] <lenswipe> actually wait
[15:13:06] <lenswipe> BinaryKitten, $('.emails').on('.input-append', '.remove', function() {
[15:13:06] <lenswipe>         alert($(this));
[15:13:06] <lenswipe>     });
[15:13:22] <lenswipe> w8 nvm
[15:14:11] <BinaryKitten> please don't paste to channel like that..
[15:14:15] <BinaryKitten> ?paste @ lenswipe
[15:14:15] <bot-t> lenswipe, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:15:01] <BinaryKitten> parentEl.on('eventName', 'childselector', event_fn)
[15:15:06] <lenswipe> yeah i got it!
[15:15:07] <lenswipe> thank you
[15:15:10] <BinaryKitten> :) np
[15:23:12] <tetradon> Anyone know of any pre-existing scripts or plugins for debugging php scripts using jquery? For instance, when I call a php script asynchronously with jquery, I would like to output some variables halfway through the script by returning those variables to a javascript and then keep going through the script like usual and return to the jquery callback function
[15:23:50] <Eviltwin> tetradon: Just print_r or echo json_encode them
[15:23:59] <Eviltwin> And see ?ftj for seeing XHR requests
[15:24:00] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[15:29:27] <piede> can i save an image to localstorage?
[15:30:47] <Gates> how could u draw "awesome" like as a symbol or on someone or something?
[15:32:00] <Gates> cuz u cannot draw "awesome" while you cannot draw "luck" you can draw a rabbits foot
[15:33:27] <tetradon> Eviltwin: I wasn't aware you could call json_encode more than once. But there's no reason why you could. It works. Thanks.
[15:33:35] <tetradon> couldn't*
[15:36:36] <Eviltwin> While debugging this way, the API likely won't work correctly
[15:36:47] <Eviltwin> But it should give you what you need to debug
[15:37:37] <tetradon> hmmm, right
[15:39:29] <tetradon> Okay so let's say I call a function with a php class that calls another function inside another php class. How can I view the current state of a variable in the 2nd class instead of viewing it at the end when I finally return?
[15:39:50] <tetradon> Because I can't use json_encode back to the php script
[15:48:41] <lenswipe> BinaryKitten, is it possible to use jquery to detect what form field was selected when someone hits return?
[15:52:59] <BinaryKitten> hits return?
[15:53:16] <tetradon> enter you mean?
[15:59:37] <tetradon> lenswipe: you could do something like this: <input name="form-field2" onKeyDown="javascript:keyevent(event, this);" />
[16:00:07] <lenswipe> ?
[16:00:55] <tetradon> then in your javascript write: function keyevent(e, this) { if (e.keyCode == 13) { $getEle = this; }}
[16:01:41] <tetradon> Or just set an ID on the input field and use jquery to do all the work
[16:02:17] <tetradon> and you can just use $(this) to get the input field
[16:03:07] <soosaa> Hi all
[16:03:27] <soosaa> I would like to know if there is some way to "'Strip a background" with Jquery ?
[16:04:31] <Eviltwin> soosaa: What do you mean by that?
[16:04:46] <lenswipe> tetradon, i might look at it tomorrow
[16:04:50] <lenswipe> but thanks
[16:04:59] <tetradon> in jquery have a function listening on the input form. If enter clicked, get the current input on focus using $(".:focus")
[16:05:12] <tetradon> it's pretty easy. google if you get lost
[16:05:27] <soosaa> Eviltwin : i would like to apply a "tiger" strip to my background
[16:05:40] <Eviltwin> soosaa: What do you mean by that?
[16:05:46] <tetradon> lol
[16:06:03] <soosaa> For exemple : I have a backgroound-color:black
[16:06:09] <mumblejumble> I'm a bit confused.. if I want to loop through all the elements of a div and get the data within an data tag, how would I got about that? I thought I could do $('#myDiv').children().each(function(){ $(this).data('id');}); but that doesn't work..
[16:06:13] <soosaa> and i would like to get white strip on it
[16:06:21] <Eviltwin> ?css @ soosaa
[16:06:21] <bot-t> soosaa, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[16:06:39] <Eviltwin> You can set CSS properties
[16:06:50] <Eviltwin> But anything beyond that
[16:07:05] <Eviltwin> Probably not
[16:07:12] <soosaa> http://images2.layoutsparks.com/1/148309/green-day-stripped-lines.gif
[16:07:28] <soosaa> that what i would like to do :s
[16:07:53] <Eviltwin> soosaa: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp
[16:08:40] <soosaa> Yes but u know i don't want to use an image as background
[16:09:04] <soosaa> only a color
[16:09:13] <soosaa> but put strip on it with jquery
[16:09:31] <tetradon> soosaa: $('#bg').css({ "background" : "url(/assets/images/stripe.png)", "backgroundPosition" : "center center"});

[16:10:41] <soosaa> will try it tetradon, but it will remove my background-color no ?
[16:10:52] <pifantastic> ?p @ piede
[16:10:52] <BinaryKitten> yes it will
[16:10:53] <bot-t> piede, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:11:01] <BinaryKitten> since it's setting background
[16:11:07] <BinaryKitten> rather than background-image
[16:11:13] <soosaa> :/
[16:11:28] <tetradon> put the color in another div and the background image in the #bg div
[16:11:48] <BinaryKitten> ???
[16:11:58] <pifantastic> piede: Are you drawing the image on canvas and then getting the data URI and storing that in localStorage?
[16:12:03] <pifantastic> not show how else you would do it
[16:12:20] <pifantastic> sure*
[16:12:20] <tetradon> or use background-image
[16:12:28] <tetradon> this isn't that hard
[16:12:32] <piede> pifantastic: exactly
[16:12:39] <soosaa> ok will try it tetradon
[16:12:40] <soosaa> thx
[16:12:48] <piede> I need to store an image captured from the camera though
[16:13:04] <BinaryKitten> piede?? camera?
[16:13:07] <piede> which I can visualize on the screen as the src of an image tag
[16:13:10] <tetradon> soosaa: alright, hope that helps.
[16:13:35] <piede> the camera of the phone
[17:44:25] <lionmac> what is this error is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[17:45:32] <astropirate> lionmac, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[17:46:31] <lionmac> still dont get it
[17:53:15] <simtsit> hi :) i try to install jquery.cycle (D6) but anything i try it goes wrong. any tip? thnx
[17:53:47] <pifantastic> lionmac: you cannot make Ajax requests across domains
[17:54:08] <pifantastic> You're probably going to want jsonp, or have your domain allow cross origin requests
[18:11:19] <Validatorian> ajpiano
[18:11:28] <Validatorian> whoops :)
[18:11:36] <Validatorian> you there, ajpiano?
[18:13:00] <RandalSchwartz> ajpiano is never a whoops
[18:13:10] <RandalSchwartz> ajorgan maybe
[18:18:19] <shifter1> can $.ready() be called on elements other than document?
[18:18:48] <shifter1> specifically for img elements
[18:26:24] <rodyhaddad> shifter1, probably not (probably does some bugs). did you try it? search on google et look at the doc, it has some info on imgs :)
[18:26:37] <fhil> .ready():While JavaScript provides the load event for executing code when a page is rendered, this event does not get triggered until all assets such as images have been completely received.
[18:27:22] <fhil> You can certainly attach ready() to an image and its handler will be executed after the document.ready() was executed.
[18:27:23] <Validatorian> shifter1: I've had some success with .bind('ready', function(){...}) on some things (iframes, specifically) -- not sure if it will work on images though
[18:27:44] <fhil> iFrame has it's document
[18:28:16] <Validatorian> yes, but it works cross-domain, which wouldn't be able to be accessed via JS, as I understand
[18:28:18] <fhil> .ready() on an image will work, except it does not say much more than the $(document).ready() does.
[18:28:46] <shifter1> the .load() method in the jquery docs deosnt make any promises that the img actually did load
[18:28:55] <fhil> (document).ready() will execute AFTER the image is loaded anyways
[18:29:02] <Validatorian> I know .error() will work on an image, if that's something you're after
[18:29:15] <shifter1> Is there some way I can be sure either the image loaded succesfully or not at all?
[18:29:22] <shifter1> ie. no ambiguitiy
[18:29:30] <Validatorian> .error will catch if the image does not load
[18:29:46] <fhil> just by catching the (404,*) error
[18:30:17] <simtsit> trying to quit smoking and jquery is a saccessful way for a headique :(
[18:30:29] <Validatorian> that'll be the case with most broken images, though
[18:31:33] <nishttal2> hello ppl.. how do i put one canvas exactly on top of the other.. http://fpaste.org/J9Yp/
[18:32:12] <fhil> $(.quitSomke).ready(function(e) { celebrateBetterHealth(e); });
[18:32:12] <shifter1> nishttal2: use the css postion: fixed
[18:32:36] <simtsit> fhil++
[18:32:47] <nishttal2> shifter1, they are both below a heading.. did you see my link.. its only 5 lines
[18:33:31] <simtsit> so, it seems like jquery doesn't work in my Drupal 6 installation.... what i could possibly do wrong?
[18:35:11] <fhil> Lots. Typo most likely or script order on page? I don't do php but what makes drupal different...
[18:37:04] <Articate> if I have a <select> with options, and I have bound the .keypress() to a function that changes what's shown based on which option you've selected, I get this strange delay
[18:37:22] <Articate> if I press it once, nothing happens. If I press down once more, the previous selection is what it's changed to
[18:37:54] <Articate> I've bound the same select's .change() with the same function, which works
[18:38:13] <Articate> Any remedy?
[18:39:13] <fhil> what's changing on keypress?
[18:39:21] <fhil> I mean, what you try to change?
[18:39:42] <simtsit> ajax?
[18:40:25] <Articate> I hide some <input>s and show the correct one
[18:42:07] <Articate> keyup() instead :)
[18:43:50] <nishttal2> If I am using a jquery class (say ui-widget-content ui-corner-all) for my div.. can i change the position property to relative so it overrides whatever is defined inthose 2 classes?
[18:45:16] <Lonestar99> good evening folks
[18:45:47] <coldhead> Lonestar99, my old friend
[18:46:08] <Lonestar99> still can not figure out why my .on() events do not work properly -->  http://jsfiddle.net/3qtLe/3/
[18:46:16] <Lonestar99> howdy coldhead
[18:47:16] <Lonestar99> .off() .on() work on next buttons but only .off works on  previous buttons...
[18:47:57] <coldhead> i don't understnad code like this, Lonestar99:     $('#pv').on('click');
[18:48:24] <coldhead> i would expect $('#pv').on('click', function () {... do stuff here ...});
[18:48:37] <coldhead> with just on('click') i don't know what you're trying to do
[18:49:30] <coldhead> ?on
[18:49:30] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:50:04] <ragnok> hey!  who wants to play a game? join #wolfgame
[18:50:50] <Lonestar99> it is a simple pagination, with next and previous buttons,  when the previous button is grey do not allow click event when black allow click....
[18:52:59] <coldhead> i get that, Lonestar99
[18:53:15] <coldhead> oh well let's continue this discussion never
[18:54:00] <coldhead> sup Lonestar99
[18:54:11] <coldhead> coldhead was talking smack about you when you were offline
[18:54:17] <coldhead> but i silenced him
[18:54:30] <coldhead> Lonestar99: $('#something').on('click') is bogus
[18:54:33] <coldhead> it doesn't do anything
[18:54:45] <coldhead> either add a 2nd argument which is the event handler
[18:54:49] <coldhead> or remve the line entirely
[18:54:52] <coldhead> hey Davey
[18:55:48] <Lonestar99> stupic twc intermittent internet
[18:56:26] <Lonestar99> coldhead ok so it is useless... ok let me look for an event handler
[18:58:38] <Lonestar99> coldhead what about  $('#something').on('click', click); ??
[18:59:44] <coldhead> Lonestar99: that would work if somewhere in your code you have function click() {alert('this is the click handler');}
[19:01:49] <Lonestar99> coldhead how can i modify the following --> $("#bb,#nx,#pv,#lg").click(function(stt) { } so it is still a click function but also has a name...
[19:03:41] <coldhead> $("#bb,#nx,#pv,#lg").click(function name_goes_here (stt) { }
[19:04:03] <coldhead> then elsewhere .on('click', name_goes_here)
[19:05:34] <Davey> Hey coldhead
[19:07:46] <fhil> Loanestar99, if I may, coldhead is trying to say that when you .off('click') you lose the function that does the click when on the on('click') you really don't put it back.
[19:08:23] <coldhead> ah, you have a better grasp of the situation than i, fhil <3
[19:08:35] <fhil> .on('click', function() [}) is needed
[19:10:09] <Lonestar99> trying --> var click = $("#bb,#nx,#pv,#lg").click(function(stt) {  ... });
[19:11:09] <fhil> Lonestar99, it's not going to work. Your code above will return the handler you need but the set of selected elemetns in $("...")
[19:11:21] <fhil> type: will not return
[19:11:47] <Lonestar99> oh ok
[19:11:56] <fhil> simply create a function myClick() {} and keep passing it arround as you need:
[19:12:06] <fhil> ().on('click', myClick);
[19:12:22] <Lonestar99> ok let write the code brb
[19:13:35] <Lonestar99> thanks
[19:17:02] <fhil> coldstar, I'm new to IRC, is it polite to get into a conversation like this?
[19:17:17] <coldhead> sure thing, fhil
[19:17:20] <coldhead> pile in
[19:19:41] <beancurd> HOW RUDE OF YOU
[19:19:53] <coldhead> HOW RUDE OF *YOU*, sir
[19:20:00] <beancurd> HOW DARE YOU CONVERSE IN THIS CHANNEL.
[19:20:04] <beancurd> ^
[19:20:07] <beancurd> what he said.
[19:20:29] <coldhead> HOW DARE YOU REPROACH IN THIS CHANNEL
[19:20:37] <beancurd> !
[19:20:38] <fhil> can't read the body language here...
[19:20:45] <beancurd> typing caps one hand is hard.
[19:20:59] <coldhead> fhil: this is a very nice channel and you can get away with anything if you mean well
[19:21:08] <coldhead> its going to be okay
[19:21:09] <Lonestar99> there is some freaking bug with my stupid code...
[19:21:21] <coldhead> and with your connection, Lonestar99 :(
[19:21:40] <beancurd> maybe the code is causing teh connection problems...
[19:21:48] <beancurd> </conspiracy keanu>
[19:22:52] <Lonestar99> yeah totally sucks
[19:23:05] <Lonestar99> i think my pagination sucks lol
[19:23:08] <fhil> Lonestar99, can you update the fiddle script?
[19:23:33] <fhil> By the way, I think pagination is out, infinite scrolling is in.
[19:24:20] <fhil> http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/the-end-of-pagination.html
[19:25:28] <Validatorian> is there any way to retain a reference to the specific item in an object when using $.map? I'm trying to make this work: http://jsfiddle.net/7xKu4/ -- it sorts great, but I need to inject the new posts where they are supposed to go, and with the current code, I don't know which post the time is in reference to (of course, if you have a better solution than what I'm doing, I'm all ears!)
[19:25:40] <Lonestar99> yeah was think about that, but need to release this code tonight, so next release will be alot better
[19:25:43] <Validatorian> +1 fhil
[19:25:51] <coldhead> yeah i have been enjoying the infinite scroll on dis magazine very much
[19:26:11] <fhil> imagine pagination on IRC lol
[19:27:21] <Lonestar99> i have an app that just adds the next results to the bottom of the previous results
[19:27:47] <Lonestar99> and so on... but kinda stuck with pagination for this code release...
[19:29:36] <Validatorian> fhil, would you mind taking a look at my jsfiddle? I'm at my wits end here, been working on this one date-sorting thing for over 24 hours.
[19:31:05] <fhil> will try in a moment
[19:32:54] <Eviltwin> vitor-br: Why don't you explain the real problem
[19:33:00] <Eviltwin> Err
[19:33:09] <Eviltwin> Validatorian: Why don't you explain the problem
[19:33:16] <Eviltwin> Rather than just showing us code you know doesn't work
[19:34:08] <fhil> Validatorian, what set is expected to be larger? The posts on the existing page or the incoming feed?
[19:34:59] <Validatorian> certainly -- the expected result in in that CSS panel, I'm trying to inject the 'new posts' into an existing stream of posts, in the correct chronological order (newest at top, oldest at bottom)
[19:35:21] <Validatorian> the 'new posts' is the object in the JS, the existing posts is of course the HTML in the HTML panel
[19:36:01] <Lonestar99> ok, i give up on my pagination, anyone know of the simplest "prev" "next" pagination script, that works...
[19:36:13] <Lonestar99> using jquery...
[19:36:20] <Lonestar99> and not a plugin
[19:36:33] <tw2113> wouldn't a plugin technically be using jquery?
[19:36:46] <Validatorian> fhil: the size of the stream isn't important (it should work regardless of which is larger) -- if I have 1 new post and 30 existing, it should just insert that one post where it should go
[19:36:47] <coldhead> here are ten! http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-pagination-plugins/
[19:36:49] <Validatorian> and vice versa
[19:38:07] <Validatorian> if anything is still unclear, please let me know -- I've been staring at this for too long.
[19:39:04] <Eviltwin> Validatorian: Take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/4maV4/
[19:39:37] <Eviltwin> Is that anything like what you're looking for?
[19:39:43] <Eviltwin> Try changing the payload on the right to add new items
[19:39:49] <Lonestar99> brb
[19:40:06] <Eviltwin> It preserves the order in the JSON array and posts are identified by unique ID
[19:41:05] <Eviltwin> This was actually designed to have posts repeatedly inserted, removed, or reordered after load over time
[19:41:42] <Eviltwin> With animations
[19:41:47] <Eviltwin> Your problem may be simpler
[19:42:18] <Validatorian> not quite -- I need to merge an object of new posts into existing posts, preferably without modifying the existing posts at all (basically, I'm thinking $(specificExistingPost).after(specificNewPost)
[19:42:57] <Validatorian> I've already got the dates sorted properly --- I just don't have access (as far as I can tell) to the originating object that date came from, so it's not much use :)
[19:43:06] <Eviltwin> So it's the HTML you want to change?
[19:43:35] <Eviltwin> Is your array of new posts already ordered?
[19:43:36] <Validatorian> correct -- the 'Result' should be what I put in the CSS panel
[19:44:12] <Validatorian> yes, it will come in ordered for itself (newest at top) -- but there can be newer and older existing posts, so each post needs to be individually handled
[19:49:40] <Eviltwin> Do they have to be broken down into little month containers like this?
[19:50:31] <Validatorian> well, the actual stream will be more about minutes and hours than months, that was mostly for simplicity (easy to tell if they are in the correct chronological order)
[19:54:23] <coldhead> time marches on
[20:05:12] <Validatorian> how can sorting be this difficult! >:(
[20:06:38] <shoky> sorting wat?!?!
[20:06:45] <Validatorian> http://jsfiddle.net/7xKu4/
[20:07:42] <Eviltwin> Validatorian: You were just making it over complicated
[20:07:43] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/7xKu4/2/
[20:08:28] <Validatorian> the top two aren't in the correct order
[20:08:34] <Validatorian> or my calendar is wrong
[20:08:59] <Eviltwin> Well one of your existing posts is from June
[20:09:04] <Eviltwin> None of your existing posts are from July
[20:10:00] <Validatorian> right -- the new post (July) should be inserted above the existing June
[20:12:23] <Eviltwin> But this ought to fix that: http://jsfiddle.net/7xKu4/3/
[20:13:28] <Validatorian> I do believe that is what I'm looking for! Going to add it to the actual code and see what happens -- thank you very much, Eviltwin
[20:13:53] <Validatorian> (also, I wasn't aware of .get() in the DOM context, only in the ajax context -- thanks for that!)
[20:14:10] <Eviltwin> Yeah, it's useful, especially when working with $.map
[20:17:03] <shoky> how so?
[20:18:05] <Eviltwin> Let's say you have something like this: $("a").map(function() { return $(this).attr("href") })
[20:18:16] <Eviltwin> What gets returned is actually a jQuery object, not an array
[20:18:26] <Eviltwin> So if you try to do certain array sort of things to it
[20:18:32] <Eviltwin> Like concatenate it into another array
[20:18:37] <Eviltwin> It won't work as expected
[20:18:40] <Eviltwin> Because it's actually an object
[20:18:48] <Eviltwin> By adding .get() to the end, you get a real array
[20:19:01] <shoky> yeah but this is always true, not just with .map
[20:20:18] <Eviltwin> How do you mean?
[20:22:08] <Eviltwin> Also, let's say you have something like this: $("div").map(function() { if(!$(this).data("secret")) return $(this).find("a") })
[20:22:25] <Eviltwin> You want to find all <A>s that are in <DIV>s that don't have a secret flag in their data
[20:22:32] <Eviltwin> If you run that query
[20:22:54] <Eviltwin> You'll get a jQuery object that contains jQuery objects that contain the <A> elements
[20:23:28] <Eviltwin> If you want one jQuery object that contains all of the elements, you need to do $("div").map(function() { if(!$(this).data("secret")) return $(this).find("a").get() })
[20:26:33] <shoky> if you return an array inside the map function, all elements are added to the result array?
[20:26:54] <shoky> all elements in the array you returned, that is
[20:27:22] <Eviltwin> If the map function returns a non-array, it becomes an item in the output array
[20:27:35] <Eviltwin> If it returns an array, the items of that array all become items in the output array
[20:27:41] <shoky> i see
[20:27:53] <shoky> thanks for explaining
[20:28:29] <Eviltwin> And because jQuery objects aren't actually arrays, they get added as items in the array
[20:28:54] <shoky> gotcha
[20:29:55] <Validatorian> woo, it appears to be working! :)
[20:31:17] <raj> i've got a .on('click', function...) on an <a> tag, but everytime I click the link, the next time it runs the click function an additional time
[20:31:38] <Eviltwin> Are you binding that inside an event listener?
[20:31:47] <Eviltwin> There's usually not a good reason to do that on an existing elemen
[20:31:48] <Eviltwin> t
[20:31:51] <raj> yes
[20:32:35] <Eviltwin> Otherwise you end up with multiple bindings like you've just described
[20:33:33] <raj> but the click of something else sets up this link
[20:33:38] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Who'd you flood? :P
[20:33:58] <Eviltwin> raj: I think it might be jsFiddle time if you want us to help with this.
[20:34:17] <raj> k, i'll see what I can throw together
[20:34:52] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: no one
[20:34:53] <ajpiano> !
[20:35:04] <ajpiano> i just got on some hotel wifi though, you know how that goes
[20:35:17] <brainopia> i want to set default scroll when page is loaded unfortunately firefox and chrome set their own default scroll position if page was reloaded, is there any workaround?
[20:37:10] <Lonestar99> var bs = -1;  if(parseInt(bs) < 0){ ... } else { }  is the former correct?
[20:37:47] <Eviltwin> brainopia: Use setTimeout to delay it a bit
[20:38:03] <Eviltwin> Might even be able to get away with setTimeout(function() { ... }, 0);
[20:38:52] <Lonestar99> what to compare a negative number to zero...
[20:39:05] <Eviltwin> Lonestar99: ...what?
[20:39:09] <brainopia> Eviltwin: I've tried it, but somehow that's not enough, I've tried to set unto 2 seconds of timeout, but it will work only in 50% of cases
[20:39:23] <Lonestar99> Eviltwin:  do not think the above is working...
[20:39:28] <brainopia> upto*
[20:39:54] <Lonestar99> i have a negative string "-1"  if less than zero then...
[20:40:02] <Validatorian> ajpiano: You at An Event Apart?
[20:40:11] <Eviltwin> Lonestar99: Okay...
[20:40:41] <Lonestar99> but do not think this is working --> var bs = -1; if(parseInt(bs) < 0){ ... } else { }
[20:40:56] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ Lonestar99
[20:40:57] <bot-t> Lonestar99, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:41:16] <Lonestar99> ok let me recreate
[20:49:33] <Lonestar99> f*ck this cable connection is killing me ... anyways --> http://jsfiddle.net/3qtLe/5/
[20:56:53] <karttoon> email = $( "#email" ),
[20:56:59] <karttoon> This breaks on IE
[20:57:07] <karttoon> IE8
[20:57:19] <versatiletech> comma?
[20:57:44] <karttoon> There are a number of the same thing seperated by commas
[20:57:54] <karttoon> Error is "Object doesn't support this property or method"
[20:57:59] <versatiletech> if there a hanging comma?
[20:58:06] <versatiletech> oh, that's something else
[20:58:43] <versatiletech> have you used the F12 developer tool?
[20:59:23] <karttoon> no
[20:59:41] <versatiletech> press f12, I think it should make it come up
[21:00:13] <versatiletech> if not, go to "tools", I think, and click on developer tools, or something like that
[21:01:09] <karttoon> Yeah, it just shows the same error
[21:01:18] <versatiletech> go to the scripts tab
[21:01:30] <simtsit> any idea why i can't use jquery in any of my drupal 6 projects? in D7 it works fine :)
[21:01:32] <versatiletech> there's a button that says break on error
[21:01:33] <versatiletech> I believe
[21:01:53] <versatiletech> click that, then hit start debug
[21:02:03] <versatiletech> it should refresh the page
[21:02:08] <versatiletech> if it doesn't refresh manually
[21:02:21] <karttoon> I mean that is specifically what is causing the error
[21:02:28] <karttoon> email = $( "#email" );
[21:03:03] <versatiletech> so if you comment it out, not error?
[21:03:09] <karttoon> IE8 doesn't want the variable to load that
[21:03:17] <karttoon> Well then it'll error the next time I do that, so yeah
[21:03:19] <versatiletech> no*
[21:04:03] <versatiletech> can you reproduce the error in a demo?
[21:04:19] <versatiletech> ? demo @ karttoon
[21:04:19] <bot-t> karttoon, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:09:50] <karttoon> Heh I don't think JSFiddle is working for me in IE8 either :F
[21:10:12] <versatiletech> jsbin.com
[21:12:18] <karttoon> jsbin doesn't work either
[21:12:20] <karttoon> Requires HTML5
[21:12:32] <versatiletech> ?
[21:12:47] <versatiletech> last time I used it it worked fine in IE8
[21:12:50] <versatiletech> let me check
[21:13:14] <raj> Eviltwin, I tried making a fiddle, but I'm actually not sure why this isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/CtJsL/5/
[21:13:26] <raj> not the same issue i'm having from before, of course
[21:13:51] <raj> oh wait, yes, it does work
[21:13:56] <raj> it is replicating the issue
[21:14:02] <Eviltwin> raj: You know about event bubbling, right?
[21:15:05] <karttoon> Hmm
[21:15:15] <karttoon> I think I got it to work in this
[21:15:34] <raj> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/CtJsL/7/
[21:16:20] <raj> basically, if you click anywhere on "here are some words", and then click the link, it's supposed to open two pages
[21:16:56] <raj> but if you click on those words again, it'll hit callback() that many more times
[21:17:07] <versatiletech> karttoon: IE8 is working fine with jsbin.com. Are you still having issues?
[21:17:15] <versatiletech> just checked in mine
[21:17:58] <Eviltwin> So I guess I'm not sure why you're having the link add the callback to the link
[21:18:57] <karttoon> I still get HTML5 errors but it's working, and I'm not getting the error here either for that one piece of code
[21:19:22] <karttoon> Which is good, it means it supports what I'm trying to do, I just need to figure out why mine isn't :)
[21:20:36] <raj> Eviltwin, the link add the callback?
[21:21:15] <Eviltwin> raj: You seem to understand what's happening and why it's happening
[21:21:26] <Eviltwin> My question is what you want to happen
[21:23:37] <versatiletech> that's where the debugger can give you more clues
[21:23:50] <versatiletech> @karttoon: ^
[21:24:02] <raj> Eviltwin, basically, clicking on an image thumbnail (a div) on my page then reveals a link to download the pictures. multiple thumbnails can be selected at the same time by holding down ctrl. clicking on the download link then iterates through each of the pictures, allowing to download
[21:25:49] <fhil> Validatorian, did you get your question answered?
[21:32:28] <fhil> Eviltwin, I see you helped Validatorian. I've come up with something too if you care to take a look: http://jsfiddle.net/floring/QewDu/
[21:34:40] <Eviltwin> fhil: That's also O(n^2) instead of O(n log n)
[21:35:08] <Eviltwin> But that probably won't make a difference for his purposes
[21:35:22] <raj> k, I just pulled it out
[21:35:25] <raj> Eviltwin,
[21:46:39] <fhil> Eviltwin, I'm a hobbyist not a programmer. Got to translate this for me: O(n^2) instead of O(n log n). I missed the lingo;
[21:47:56] <Eviltwin> So do you understand that for(var i = 0; i < n; i++) { for(var j = 0; j < n; j++) { for(var k = 0; j < n; k++) { doSomething(); } } } takes longer than for(var i = 0; i < n; i++) { for(var j = 0; j < n; j++) { doSomething(); } } ?
[21:49:05] <Eviltwin> The O(...) notation is an attempt to quantify how much slower something gets as you increase the amount of data it has to work on
[21:49:13] <objNoob> Hai!
[21:49:21] <Eviltwin> Here's the Wikipedia article for it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation
[21:50:01] <justicefries> or bigger
[21:50:04] <justicefries> if you're talking space complexity.
[21:50:15] <objNoob> Question regarding those jQuery Session Timeout plugins. Do they use mousemove (on window, document?) to reset the idle timer?
[21:50:35] <fhil> Eviltwin, yes, I figured that. I weigh it against the payload. Point taken.
[21:58:11] <fhil> Eviltwin, do you avoid nesting loops altogether or have a performance breakpoint? Your code here (http://jsfiddle.net/7xKu4/2/) is what your best choice or you simply amended Validatorian's code?
[22:01:51] <Hypah> is there an onLoad type of function that can be applied to an img object?
[22:02:57] <Eviltwin> fhil: Rather than potentially perform the comparison with every pair of elements between the existing posts and the new ones,
[22:03:39] <Eviltwin> I have JavaScript perform only the necessary comparisons to sort the two lists
[22:03:56] <Eviltwin> And then I merge them which is a linear time operation for sorted lists
[22:04:05] <Eviltwin> Hypah: Yes, it's the load event
[22:08:03] <Eviltwin> fhil: Really the Big-O time isn't going to be the deciding factor unless there are millions or billions of posts to work with
[22:08:21] <Eviltwin> However what can make a difference is using .each etc when a simple loop would have sufficed
[22:10:05] <fhil> Eviltwin. I tend to choose the more terse answer if performance is not anticipated to be a factor. Sorting clearly is cheaper. That wikipedia article is a bit over my head though.
[22:16:22] <Hypah> is it recommended to directly set img.width = 100, rather than $(img).css({width: 100}) ?
[22:17:18] <Eviltwin> They can mean different things in different circumstances
[22:17:25] <Eviltwin> It's usually better to set the CSS
[22:51:57] <nir0> how do i know if some field is focused?
[22:53:00] <Eviltwin> .is(":focused")?
[22:53:16] <coldhead> ?:focus
[22:53:17] <bot-t> :focus: [New in v1.6] Selects element if it is currently focused. http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[22:53:23] <Eviltwin> Sorry, that's right
[22:53:26] <Eviltwin> :focus
[22:53:59] <raj> can custom classes be used with this? http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/
[22:54:10] <raj> so that the selection box adds the class I want?
[22:54:30] <Eviltwin> raj: I would read the options and events
[22:54:48] <Eviltwin> If it's not an option, there might be an event you can use to add the class you want
[22:55:26] <raj> ya, i see `selected` and `selecting` in the events
[22:55:33] <nir0> i got a photo gallery, that can switch photos by pressing arrow keys. i don't want this functionality when any field is focused (i.e. comment text area), so user will not loose his comment trying to edit it.
[22:56:00] <raj> but i was hoping to use my native class for the whole shindig, instead of just throwing on my .pic-selected class at the end of the events
[22:56:00] <Eviltwin> raj: Sounds like perfect candidates
[22:56:15] <raj> or do you think that's pointless?
[22:56:24] <Eviltwin> Well if it's not in the documented options, it's probably not easy to do without changing the plugin source
[22:56:31] <raj> right
[22:56:36] <raj> Eviltwin, this was my other option, http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drop/demo/selection
[22:56:40] <Eviltwin> So I would turn to the events
[22:56:52] <raj> can I hear your thoughts on that?
[22:57:21] <nir0> so i can type if $('input, textarea').is(':focus')
[22:57:27] <nir0> seems too easy
[22:57:31] <coldhead> ỌṋĺḬƞɛ РȞᾉŗṁăḉΫ...Ćᾛ ЀČ-Ķ āТТằḈĤṀеNṬ
[22:57:32] <Eviltwin> I don't like the fact that I have to click and drag to select things
[22:58:00] <Eviltwin> A click on its own is not sufficient
[22:58:10] <raj> Eviltwin, you mean with jquery-ui, right?
[22:58:20] <Eviltwin> I mean in your other option
[22:58:28] <raj> oh
[22:58:33] <Eviltwin> If I click without moving my mouse, it doesn't toggle the selection
[22:58:40] <raj> well, my native code does that anyway
[22:58:43] <raj> it selects with a click
[22:59:00] <Eviltwin> Okay then
[22:59:12] <Eviltwin> Sounds fine to me
[22:59:59] <raj> the thing about the jquery-ui plugin that I don't like is that I can only drag while i'm already over an item
[23:00:04] <raj> i can't start from outside the items
[23:00:21] <Cronoh> time to learn some javascript :D
[23:00:32] <Eviltwin> Well I'm a fan, supporter, and user of jQuery
[23:00:39] <Eviltwin> Can't say I'm any of the three for jQuery UI
[23:00:39] <raj> haha
[23:00:46] <raj> oh
[23:00:48] <raj> k
[23:00:52] <coldhead> well said
[23:01:02] <coldhead> somewhere ajpiano is crying
[23:01:03] <raj> i use the dialog box from ui
[23:01:24] <Eviltwin> Okay, that's not completely true, I've probably used one or two components once or twice
[23:01:36] <Eviltwin> And I've seen some pretty cool things done with jQuery UI
[23:01:37] <ircjsbot> Eviltwin, sorry, I have never seen some.
[23:01:38] <Cronoh> jquery ui is a grea tool, like a jquery framework almost :O they already gave you jquery if jquery ui is too easy
[23:01:48] <coldhead> lol ircjsbot
[23:02:03] <Cronoh> lol bot win
[23:02:19] <Cronoh> cool things jquery ui
[23:02:22] <stagen> Does anyone have an AJAX tutorial for total newbs?
[23:02:23] <Cronoh> :<
[23:02:33] <Cronoh> seen cool things jquery ui
[23:02:33] <ircjsbot> Cronoh, sorry, I have never seen cool.
[23:02:38] <raj> Eviltwin, the documentation on this selectable thing sucks for jquery-ui though
[23:02:39] <Cronoh> lol
[23:02:46] <coldhead> ?botsnack
[23:02:46] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[23:03:00] <Eviltwin> stagen: I believe it's covered in this book: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[23:03:02] <coldhead> ?botsmack
[23:03:04] <bot-t> coldhead, Couldn't find "botsmack" in jQuery Docs.
[23:03:22] <stagen> Thanks Eviltwin
[23:04:31] <varun> Hi everyone,
[23:06:48] <varun> I have a need to develop a plug-in for a menu, where I guess individual menu item can be modeled as a plug-in, while the menu bar contains all the entries(menu-items as plug-ins), the entries can added/removed dynamically from it. What I am looking for is if there's something that I can refer for such a use case.
[23:06:49] <astropirate> varun, HIIIIIIII
[23:07:07] <varun> Any help in this direction would be highly appreciated...
[23:07:19] <Eviltwin> varun: Have you seen this? http://speckyboy.com/2011/07/04/15-fresh-jquery-menu-plugins-and-tutorials/ and this? http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/38-jquery-and-css-drop-down-multi-level-menu-solutions/
[23:07:19] <ircjsbot> Eviltwin, sorry, I have never seen this.
[23:08:00] <b0x> trying to do something new and intuitive?? chances are you're wasting ur time and its already been done, and you fail at google.
[23:08:17] <varun> aah.. my bad..., I think I should go through these ones before asking,
[23:08:37] <varun> Thanks a lot Eviltwin
[23:08:37] <Eviltwin> b0x: Just trying to make sure he's seen what's out there before he wastes his time
[23:08:38] <ircjsbot> Eviltwin, sorry, I have never seen what.
[23:08:58] <Eviltwin> Okay, that's starting to piss me off.
[23:10:09] <Eviltwin> socialhapy: Is that your bot? It comes from the same IP
[23:10:55] <peol> Eviltwin, he's a bot too
[23:11:19] <Eviltwin> Oh, right
[23:11:24] <Eviltwin> I was thinking of someone else
[23:11:31] <coldhead> ?tias @ UberNinDude
[23:11:31] <bot-t> UberNinDude, Try It And See
[23:12:06] <Eviltwin> Well whoever owns ircjsbot, if he gets on my nerves again, he may get a kick
[23:12:40] <Eviltwin> Perfect delivery on the jQuery UI response but downhill from there
[23:13:07] <coldhead> he won't get a kick, fascist
[23:13:24] <coldhead> he's brand new and wonderful and nlogax will fix him plenty
[23:13:28] <coldhead> you just watch
[23:13:32] <Eviltwin> I hope so
[23:13:44] <coldhead> nlogax built this channel
[23:13:47] <Eviltwin> I wasn't going to ban the poor guy, just put a "fix me" sticker on him
[23:13:49] <coldhead> on rock and or roll
[23:14:20] <Cronoh> lol the se3n keyword is pretty broad, but toher than that ;p
[23:14:24] <Cronoh> other*
[23:14:42] <Eviltwin> Yeah and that's what's annoying me at the moment
[23:15:16] <Eviltwin> We have enough noise as is
[23:15:47] <Eviltwin> I think ircjsbot has said more tonight that he's said in his entire lifetime so far
[23:16:05] <Eviltwin> Up until today
[23:18:17] <coldhead> he's been online mere hours
[23:19:04] <coldhead> Eviltwin: file a patch? https://github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot :D
[23:20:50] <Eviltwin> I wonder if this works
[23:20:52] <Eviltwin> gtfo ircjsbot
[23:20:57] <kasi> yea
[23:21:37] <coldhead> gtfo ircjsbot
[23:21:42] <coldhead> >: |
[23:22:10] <Cronoh> ircjsbot, plsgo.
[23:22:14] <coldhead> ircjsbot: gtfo
[23:22:15] <kasi> am new to jquery..i want to know the basics of jquery...anybody give me hint for me..
[23:22:26] <raj> is jQuery(function($){ any better than $(function(){ ?
[23:22:27] <Cronoh> yes, jquery.com
[23:22:32] <raj> or equivalent
[23:22:57] <Eviltwin> raj: Sorta, it means that if someone goes and loads MooTools after you load jQuery, $ still means jQuery inside that function
[23:23:13] <raj> k, so that's the only advantage
[23:23:26] <raj> cool, thanks
[23:23:45] <Eviltwin> Maybe this
[23:23:57] <Eviltwin> Err
[23:23:58] <Eviltwin> nVM
[23:24:25] <Eviltwin> Little bastard's back for more, eh? :D
[23:24:35] <coldhead> welcome back, ircjsbot
[23:24:42] <coldhead> don't mind the curmudgeons
[23:25:17] <coldhead> oh this is cute
[23:25:22] <coldhead> ircjsbot: join #jQuery
[23:25:22] <ircjsbot> coldhead, I am already here!
[23:25:35] <coldhead> ircjsbot: join #html5
[23:25:35] <ircjsbot> coldhead, I am already in #html5, and I can prove it. The topic is as follows.

[23:26:43] <coldhead> hahahah
[23:26:55] <coldhead> can i get some ops bro?
[23:28:16] <Eviltwin> You mean you didn't even register your own channel?
[23:28:57] <raj> damnit
[23:29:07] <raj> that code interferes with jquery-fileuplaod
[23:29:13] <raj> i mean, that plugin
[23:35:12] <raj> Eviltwin, any solution if two plugins both use 'drop', such as--> .bind('drop.' + ns, {fileupload: this}, this._onDrop)
[23:36:06] <Eviltwin> ?wf
[23:36:07] <bot-t> The jQuery UI Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[23:37:00] <Eviltwin> If it's a widget, the event should be namespaced
[23:37:21] <raj> so if I'm having this issue, it's not a widget?
[23:37:28] <raj> or I'm not using it correctly?
[23:38:28] <Eviltwin> Perhaps
[23:38:35] <Eviltwin> Perhaps either of those things
[23:38:40] <raj> oh, interesting
[23:39:01] <Eviltwin> Which plugins?
[23:39:07] <raj> http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drop/demo/selection
[23:39:33] <krillep> Which is the best approach to use if I want to store a couple of pdf files (total ~20 mb) for offline usage on android tablets when developing an web app?
[23:40:58] <raj> Eviltwin, and https://raw.github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/3de48c611ef52ece9c9b185e9e8e6fe2ba45ec76/js/jquery.fileupload.js
[23:40:59] <Eviltwin> raj: Well this isn't a Widget but it appears to be using some namespacing
[23:41:10] <Eviltwin> And taht one is a widget
[23:41:58] <Eviltwin> The second one shows things like .bind('fileuploaddrop', func);
[23:42:02] <Eviltwin> Not .bind('drop', func);
[23:42:23] <Eviltwin> Looks like you can also explicitly set the namespace option to control that
[23:42:32] <Eviltwin> It uses fileupload by default
[23:42:32] <raj> there's .bind('drop.' + ...) there as well
[23:42:56] <raj> line 753
[23:43:22] <raj> and 763 unbinds
[23:43:29] <Eviltwin> Ah, so they're using the jQuery namespaces there
[23:43:41] <Eviltwin> jQuery allows you to do things like .trigger('click.foo')
[23:43:49] <raj> cuz line 721 gives me an error
[23:43:52] <Eviltwin> Which causes it to happen in the namespace
[23:43:55] <raj> due to line 753
[23:44:45] <raj> i get this error by simply including jquery.event.drop-2.0.min.js
[23:45:01] <raj> (from the drag-selection plugin we were talking about)
[23:46:29] <zoobamafu> results[index].push({obj}); is this allowed?
[23:46:53] <zoobamafu> says results has no method push
[23:47:09] <raj> Eviltwin, is there any solution?
[23:47:22] <jovrtn> log the results object and make sure it's an array
[23:47:24] <jovrtn> zoomba
[23:47:31] <jovrtn> push is an array method only
[23:47:31] <xec_> zoobamafu: is there an array in results[index]?
[23:47:54] <zoobamafu> xec_, no. results[index] is an array
[23:48:03] <zoobamafu> that will hold objects
[23:48:11] <Eviltwin> raj: Maybe try binding to the namespace?
[23:48:15] <Eviltwin> Or triggering on the namespce
[23:48:24] <zoobamafu> var results = [];
[23:48:25] <raj> i'm not sure how to do that
[23:48:28] <Eviltwin> .trigger("drop.fileupload") or something like that
[23:48:29] <zoobamafu> thats how i declared it
[23:48:34] <raj> are you saying to edit the sourcecode of the plugin?
[23:48:43] <Eviltwin> Are you triggering any events yourself?
[23:48:47] <jovrtn> is the object stored in results[index] an array as well?
[23:48:50] <Eviltwin> Or is this all happening on its own
[23:48:53] <xec_> zoobamafu: so you mean "results[index] is NOT an array"
[23:49:08] <zoobamafu> xec_ i mean it is
[23:49:13] <xec_> zoobamafu: what?
[23:49:26] <zoobamafu> xec_ results[index]
[23:49:46] <zoobamafu> xec_, var results = [];
[23:49:56] <xec_> zoobamafu: results is an array, you can push to that, but surely, whatever is inside results[index] is NOT
[23:50:12] <raj> Eviltwin, it happens anytime I drag my mouse within a particular div
[23:50:20] <xec_> zoobamafu: to put it another way: do you have an array inside an array?
[23:50:46] <zoobamafu> xec_, oh. no
[23:51:05] <zoobamafu> there are objects inside the array
[23:51:12] <xec_> zoobamafu: then maybe try results.push(... ?
[23:51:51] <zoobamafu> i wanted to overwrite the array or put the values in a new one
[23:52:26] <FredrikAK> Hi, I have a quick question. I'm just starting to learn jquery ui, and I'm implementing tabs, but I want it to be collapsed on page load, how can I do this?
[23:54:24] <Cronoh> have you tried using collapsible ?
[23:54:33] <FredrikAK> Yes, but it defaults to having the first tab open
[23:54:43] <FredrikAK> I want it to load collapsed
[23:54:44] <zoobamafu> might anyone know how to avoid the "Converting circular structure to JSON" error
[23:54:50] <Cronoh> i havent used jquery ui in ages, can you set it to start with no tab selected, with collapsible on
[23:55:10] <raj> Eviltwin, any idea?
[23:55:20] <Cronoh> To set all tabs to unselected pass -1 as value.
[23:55:21] <FredrikAK> Lemme try, should I just use a index that isnt valid to select no tab?
[23:55:31] <FredrikAK> Thanks :)
[23:55:36] <Cronoh> yw!
[23:56:47] <FredrikAK> That worked perfect :)
[23:56:50] <Cronoh> zoobamafu, have you checked google? i see a lot of results but havent read into them
[23:56:56] <Cronoh> FredrikAK: Awesome.
[23:58:05] <zoobamafu> Cronoh, i have. i know what causes the error but not how to avoid it
[23:58:45] <zoobamafu> i have a script that gives the error on the first run but not on the second
[23:58:58] <zoobamafu> i have a script that gives the error on the second run but not on the first
[23:59:08] <Cork> zoobamafu: that sounds like an async error
[23:59:19] <Cork> first time your loading from cache so you see the error
[23:59:25] <Cork> sorry oposit
[23:59:39] <zoobamafu> Cork, Im using nodejs and it does use async functions
[23:59:41] <Cork> first time you load from the net so you see the error
[23:59:48] <xec_> zoobamafu: if you just want to overwrite just do results[index] = whatever ?
