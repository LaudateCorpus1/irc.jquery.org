[00:11:03] <anli__> Should it be possible to dblclick on an <option>?
[00:13:00] <xec_> anli__: not sure, i would expect it to get selected and "disappear" from the first click
[00:13:25] <anli__> ok, I made it work by accessing the right webpage however :)
[00:13:32] <anli__> But I am not sure about the cross browsability
[00:15:06] <xec_> wha
[00:16:34] <coldhead> cross browsability aside, it's going to seem weird to users
[00:16:48] <coldhead> if a site asked me to double click an option i'd need to go lie down for a while
[00:26:21] <HYPERFUNBRO> how would I go about making a div disappear (via instant fadeOut) upon a click outside of said div?
[00:28:33] <coldhead> HYPERFUNBRO: http://jsfiddle.net/fUm5U/
[00:28:34] <coldhead> like so
[00:29:13] <HYPERFUNBRO> hm
[00:29:39] <HYPERFUNBRO> ok
[00:29:44] <HYPERFUNBRO> I think I see what you mean
[00:30:22] <HYPERFUNBRO> sec
[00:32:55] <prefix> hm
[00:38:08] <ravenzz> which version of jQuery deprecates $.browser
[00:38:09] <ravenzz> ?
[00:42:00] <xec_> ravenzz: checked the docs?
[00:42:56] <ravenzz> xec_ yeah sorry :)
[00:43:05] <ravenzz> lazy question
[00:43:10] <xec_> :)
[00:43:31] <prefix> I HAVE CREATED A MASTERFUL CONTRAPTION
[00:44:33] <deckTrout> why the id of element inherited to the descendants without id of themselves?
[00:45:16] <AllTuna> Hey
[00:45:49] <AllTuna> I have to list my business's services, wondering if anyone has any recomended scripts to do so?
[00:53:50] <xec_> deckTrout: your question doesn't make much sense to me
[00:54:02] <xec_> deckTrout: rephrase?
[00:54:22] <moritz> hi; is it safe to pass external data (the URL hash) to a jquery selector?
[00:55:27] <xec_> moritz: "safe" in what sense? javascript is client side, and the client has full control over what it runs anyway
[00:56:28] <seutje> it used to be unsafe
[00:57:25] <seutje> xec_: someone could link you to http://some.site/#<img src="some.img" onload="evil()" />
[00:57:58] <seutje> and if the hash was passed into jquery straight up (up to 1.6 I think?), it would be parsed as html
[00:58:10] <seutje> ok, poor example, but u get the idea
[00:58:24] <seutje> moritz: newer jQueries guard against this
[00:58:35] <xec_> yeah i see where you're going. xss-wise it's probably not a good idea.
[00:58:51] <xec_> seutje: how does newer jquery guard?
[00:58:56] <seutje> ppl will click anything they're presented with
[00:59:13] <seutje> I think if it starts with a bang or a dot, it can't contain html
[00:59:20] <seutje> or it just discards the html, not sure
[00:59:46] <moritz> seutje: s/bang/hash/ ?
[00:59:55] <seutje> w/e
[01:00:08] <seutje> it's called something different every week -_-
[01:00:21] <hooloovo1> bang!
[01:00:38] <moritz> bang is !, hash is #
[01:00:45] <xec_> what moritz said
[01:00:58] <xec_> hashbang is #!
[01:00:59] <xec_> :D
[01:06:44] <seutje> xec_: ok, so the way they fixed it, sorta kinda, is by changing the regexp to do less forward looking to see if something looks like html with crap around it, and only permit html to be created when the string started with angle brackets https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L52
[01:20:33] <Anticom> hi all
[01:21:01] <Anticom> what's the difference between target, currentTarget and delegateTarget in a jq event?
[01:27:45] <seutje> Anticom: target is the element that fired the event, currentTarget is the current element in the bubbling and delegateTarget is the element the handler was bound to
[01:28:09] <Anticom> seutje thank you :)
[01:28:51] <seutje> so say you have <div class="foo"><div class="bar"><a href="#">meh</a></div></div> and I had $('.foo').on('click', '.bar', function(e) {});
[01:29:06] <seutje> and if I then clicked the link, that would be e.target
[01:29:15] <seutje> e.currentTarget would be .bar
[01:29:21] <seutje> e.delegateTarget would be .foo
[01:29:28] <seutje> ... I think
[01:41:14] <hlve> using jquery, what would be the best way to sort a list alphabetically vertically? i've tried a few plugins, and they either suck, or don't work properly lol.
[01:41:39] <Cork> hlve: by a list you mean <li> elements? or an array?
[01:41:53] <hlve> li elements, sorry I wasn't specific ;P
[01:42:05] <hlve> they by default, will order left to right.
[01:42:13] <Cork> and you want to sort it by the content of the element?
[01:42:14] <hlve> Not top to bottom.
[01:42:45] <hlve> They don't even need to be resorted. In the HTML, they're sorted already. But the way they're being rendered, is left to right, as opposed to top to bottom.
[01:43:18] <Cork> ok, thats something completely different
[01:43:26] <hlve> sorry, wasn't sure how to ask it lol.
[01:43:31] <Cork> you have display: inline; or float: left
[01:43:37] <Cork> remove that and you would get a normal list
[01:43:56] <hlve> well, that's an issue lol.
[01:44:22] <hlve> I've sorta created fo-columns using the float:left... because IE9 hates CSS3.
[01:44:35] <hlve> http://picsend.net/images/610329AppTopLeve.png
[01:44:40] <Cork> fo-columns?
[01:45:02] <Cork> well you can't do it like that
[01:45:09] <Cork> float is inline so it will go from left to right
[01:45:15] <hlve> Hmm.
[01:45:36] <hlve> what if there's no float left, but there is a display:inline ?
[01:45:45] <hlve> the same thing, I'm assuming?
[01:45:45] <Cork> same
[01:45:48] <Cork> yes
[01:45:49] <hlve> hm.
[01:45:59] <hlve> inline-block wouldn't make a difference I'm also assuming?
[01:46:07] <Cork> only way to "fake" it is to wrapp each group
[01:46:19] <Cork> but then it won't adjust automatically
[01:46:21] <hlve> can't do that either, because the way it's coded lol.
[01:46:58] <Cork> only other option is to sort it so you have 1, 12, 24, 36, 2, 13...
[01:47:21] <hlve> I probably need to just re-code this entire thing. I finally got it to display in columns without using the CSS3 property, so IE8/9 love it, but the left-to-right rendering ruins it.
[01:47:44] <Cork> ya, it's a classical problem
[01:48:08] <Cork> and why they came up with the grid/flex/column... rules
[01:48:12] <hlve> i couldn't reorder the list using jquery to render it top to bottom?
[01:48:30] <Cork> you could, not sure how fast it would be though
[01:48:55] <hlve> How would I do that, just to see?
[01:49:25] <hlve> I was trying the following, but it didn't do anything at all.
[01:49:26] <hlve> $(".CatLists li").sort(asc_sort).appendTo('.CatLists'); function asc_sort(a, b){ return ($(b).text()) < ($(a).text()); }
[01:49:48] <hlve> That's kinda what I came across on Google. Didn't get me anywhere though.
[01:50:34] <iaj> There are some well inside .quickaccess .links text entries that are like <a href="...">My foo</a>  or <a href="...">My baz</a>  is there some easy way to get those to have the "My" wrapped inside a span?
[01:50:54] <iaj> eg <a href="..."><span class="foo">My</span> foo</a>
[01:51:40] <Cork> hlve: something like: var list = $('li'); for(var i = 0;i < list.length; i += Math.floor(list.length / 4)) { parent.append(list[i]); } for(var i = 1;i < list.length; i += Math.floor(list.length / 4)) { parent.append(list[i]); } for(var i = 3;i < list.length; i += Math.floor(list.length / 4)) { parent.append(list[i]); } for(var i = 3;i < list.length; i += ) { parent.append(list[i]); }
[01:51:59] <hlve> Cork, thanks. trying it now.
[01:52:24] <Cork> iaj: could you try rephrasing that?
[01:52:43] <Cork> you want to search for my and wrap it in a span?
[01:52:50] <ThoMe> hiho!
[01:52:51] <iaj> Yeah..
[01:52:56] <Cork> nor really
[01:53:06] <Cork> *not
[01:53:19] <iaj> Make all My â€¦ inside a certain structure be wrapped by <span>
[01:53:22] <Cork> text isn't dom so you would have to resort to regex
[01:53:23] <ThoMe> i have a html <tbody id="results-list"></tbody> and say: $('#results-list').append('<tr rel="0"><td class="no-results" colspan="3">Keine Treffer</td></tr>');
[01:53:32] <ThoMe> when i show in my firefox, then it is "hidden"
[01:53:42] <ThoMe> when i use ajax and "error"
[01:53:56] <iaj> Cork: urgs.. that sounds odd :(
[01:54:11] <Cork> iaj: well you want to search and edit text
[01:54:28] <Cork> each word in an element isn't a separat dom element, so the dom can't help you
[01:54:32] <iaj> Cork: and when I know exactly what class I have where I want to change the text?
[01:54:43] <iaj> <a href="http://server-84-33-2-64.static.serverclienti.com/checkout/cart/" title="My Cart" class="top-link-cart">My Cart</a>   < eg change that My Cart here.
[01:55:15] <iaj> So change the .top-link-cart My Cart to <span>My</span> Cart
[01:55:49] <Cork> var elm = $('a'); elm.text(elm.text().regex(/(My)/'<span class="foo">$1</span>'));
[01:56:04] <Cork> i don't remember if its $1 or \1
[01:56:21] <Cork> uh... and it's not regex >_<
[01:56:30] * Cork rewrites it all
[01:57:40] <iaj> Hahha but I see the way.. well you need the $2 no?
[01:57:41] <Cork> var elm = $('a'); elm.html(elm.html().replace(/(My)/, '<span class="foo">$1</span>'));
[01:58:05] <Cork> js> print('works')
[01:58:08] <b-ot> Cork: works
[01:58:08] <redshark50> good morning all
[01:58:19] <Cork> js> print("My Cart".replace(/(My)/, '<span class="foo">$1</span>'))
[01:58:22] <b-ot> Cork: <span class="foo">My</span> Cart
[01:59:12] <redshark50> I'm getting an error about the use of 'nth' in this line, what's wrong with it?
[01:59:14] <redshark50> $('.viewtbl tbody tr:nth-(2) td .sectiondataarea').prepend('<div id="product-images" class="theme-default"></div>');
[01:59:15] <xec_> js> "works"
[01:59:18] <b-ot> xec_: No output.
[01:59:22] <xec_> sight
[01:59:24] <xec_> -t
[01:59:26] <Cork> :D
[01:59:31] <xec_> sigh*
[01:59:32] <xec_> :P
[01:59:50] <Cork> redbrick: nth-child(2)
[01:59:58] <xec_> why wouldn't the bot output the return value, silly thing ;)
[02:00:05] <Cork> it never has
[02:00:19] <xec_> bot-t did :(
[02:00:21] <redshark50> thanks Cork!
[02:00:21] <Cork> ya
[02:00:26] * redshark50 bows
[02:00:37] <Cork> and... wrong nick :x
[02:00:50] <Cork> redshark50: warning though nth-child isn't cross browser
[02:01:16] <xec_> in a jquery selector it is
[02:01:21] <Cork> no
[02:01:25] <xec_> yes
[02:01:33] <xec_> it just wont be as efficient
[02:01:34] <Cork> nth-child is only supported if the browser provides it
[02:01:34] <seutje> tr:first-child + tr goes back to IE7!
[02:01:55] <Cork> eq and the like is jquery
[02:01:59] <seutje> not as flexible, but works for most simple nth-child implementations
[02:02:04] <redshark50> and if their on IE6 they can suck my fat ones...
[02:02:14] <redshark50> they're*
[02:02:26] <seutje> direct sibling selector is so neglected
[02:02:29] <Cork> uh...
[02:02:33] <Cork> nth-child is ie9
[02:02:35] <Cork> not ie7
[02:02:39] <seutje> eeeer, next subling
[02:02:39] <xec_> Cork: http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[02:03:02] <seutje> that's why I said :first-child +
[02:03:03] <xec_> Cork: nth-child is implemented in sizzle afaik
[02:04:30] <redshark50> so would second-child work instead of nth?
[02:04:50] <xec_> Cork: if querySelectorAll is supported by the browser, :nth-child will be handed off to that, if not, jquery will handle it instead. in any case the selector works cross-browser
[02:05:27] <xec_> redshark50: there is no :second-child
[02:05:37] <xec_> redshark50: only :nth-child(2)
[02:05:56] <redshark50> xec_: just checking!
[02:05:59] <seutje> is my text not getting through or something?
[02:06:17] <seutje> hello? :<
[02:06:27] <xec_> shhhh, nobody answer
[02:06:34] <redshark50> answer who?
[02:06:37] <xec_> :D
[02:06:39] <redshark50> ;)
[02:06:45] <seutje> :'(
[02:06:47] <iaj> Cork: thanks man:)
[02:10:21] <redshark50> also got another puzzle
[02:10:21] <redshark50> http://jsfiddle.net/dMfVz/
[02:10:24] <xec_> seutje: there is no qsa in ie7, so using an ie7 compatible css selector in jquery is... not neccessary.
[02:11:07] <redshark50> I'm trying to get the .supportTxt div and it's children to show in the 'support & downloads' tab
[02:11:26] <seutje> xec_: and ie8 has no nth-child, but does have qsa
[02:11:44] <redshark50> I've recently added two divs (left and right) to the supportTxt div and it's stopped working
[02:12:30] <redshark50> and when the S&D tab is clicked it says 'undefined'
[02:13:13] <redshark50> whilst leaving the .supportTxt div in the product info tab (where it's supposed to pull it from)
[02:13:55] <redshark50> I presume there is something wrong with the var on line 3
[02:14:06] <iaj> Cork: hmm tried your example.. but somehow it replaces all texts with the first found between the <a></a>  see here: http://server-84-33-2-64.static.serverclienti.com/
[02:15:04] <xec_> seutje: point is, it will work. test http://jsfiddle.net/8tumG/show/ in IE8 - second item will be green (but no underline)
[02:15:31] <seutje> supported !== optimal
[02:21:39] <xec_> seutje: ie8 seems unable to post the results, to jsperf for some reason, but in any case, you would need to run a selector a hell of a lot of times in order to make it a noticeable difference http://jsperf.com/jquery-nth-child-vs-first-child-sibling
[02:22:08] <xec_> seutje: Cork was implying it would not work, which is clearly not the case
[02:22:49] <adac> How can I check if query is correctly loaded?
[02:23:07] <seutje> !!window.jQuery
[02:23:07] <xec_> optimizing a single selector that is run once, to optimize for a single browser !== optimal
[02:23:08] <xec_> ;)
[02:23:53] <seutje> blindly counting on a library to do the massaging is, I guess
[02:31:47] <Cork> xec: sorry got busy, ya, looks like newer sizzle actually fakes it
[02:31:55] <Cork> i know that a bit back it didn't
[02:43:16] <Alina-malina> Hello all, i am trying to add additional information with each image with this script http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/angularjs.html, but i am not sure how to do that, can anyone help me?
[02:46:40] <iaj> Cork: shouldnt the elm.html(elm.html().replace...) work on all the elm that were stored by var elm = $('a'); ?
[02:46:51] <Cork> no
[02:46:55] <Cork> just the first one
[02:47:02] <Cork> you need to loop them
[02:47:06] <yedi> can someone help me figure out why this isn't selecting the element: https://gist.github.com/yedi/5574830
[02:47:23] <yedi> (console output)
[02:47:41] <Cork> your missing the closing bracket
[02:47:53] <Cork> value="_all"' => value="_all"]'
[02:48:25] <yedi> ugh... lol thanks
[02:53:17] <Trisox> Cork: 0/
[02:53:56] <Alina-malina> someone can please explain what author want to say by this link: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/How-to-submit-additional-form-data   on the line Next we need to bind a callback to the "submit" event ...
[02:56:04] <Alina-malina> ANYONE?
[02:57:22] <Cork> Alina-malina: you have an example just below
[02:57:29] <Cork> Trisox: o/
[02:57:47] <Trisox> yo sup
[02:58:04] <Alina-malina> Cork, i am not sure where to put that in what file, and what place
[02:58:15] <Cork> tryhing to figure out how it structure a page that will run under strict csp
[02:58:23] <Cork> but still needs to load extra scripts from actions
[02:58:27] <Cork> its... tricky
[02:58:51] <Trisox> hmm never done that
[02:58:54] <Cork> Alina-malina: you have a call where you create the download widget
[02:59:05] <Cork> and this one binds the event handler to the same element
[02:59:27] <Cork> Trisox: $.getScript $.ajax(type:'script') doesn't work
[02:59:41] <Trisox> well
[02:59:42] <Cork> and i need to send headers to the server so <script> doesn't work...
[02:59:43] <Cork> tricky
[02:59:56] <Trisox> what doenst work there?
[03:00:07] <Cork> csp blocks inline javascript
[03:00:14] <Trisox> hmmm
[03:00:19] <Cork> and it blocks eval/new Function (that jquery uses)
[03:00:33] <Trisox> so you want to use amd like stuff
[03:01:03] <Cork> i want to actually tell the browser to execute a js script through ajax
[03:01:14] <Cork> but as far as i can tell it's not possible at all
[03:01:35] <Alina-malina> Cork, i cant find that, is that in js file? or in my php file? i cant understand that part
[03:01:58] <Cork> Alina-malina: have you managed to initialize the plugin?
[03:02:06] <Cork> so you get the upload widget
[03:02:19] <Alina-malina> Cork, the script is working, i just want to add a function to add title with each image
[03:02:41] <Cork> so, where you initialize it, you have a selector that you use for the target element
[03:02:50] <Trisox> well on complete..
[03:02:51] <Cork> that is what you use to bind the event handler
[03:03:06] <Trisox> that function load there your included js file
[03:03:13] <Trisox> and call it there
[03:03:31] <Cork> Trisox: who are you talking to?
[03:03:50] <Trisox> you
[03:04:10] <Trisox> i did something like this once
[03:04:14] <Trisox>                         complete:function () {                             jqueryAjaxFunctions();                         }
[03:04:23] <Cork> if ajax sends the script back, the only way to run it is through eval or Function
[03:04:33] <Cork> you can't load it
[03:04:54] <Trisox> i got the function that can run it.. loaded in an other file
[03:04:55] <Cork> if you create a <script> and add the text content to it, it will be inline script, and thats blocked too
[03:05:01] <Cork> but how?
[03:05:13] <Cork> request the same js file twice?
[03:05:17] <Trisox> just 1 js file with all functions.. that you wanna run..
[03:05:34] <Cork> sure, but when extra features needs to be loaded?
[03:05:39] <Trisox> just like $('.charcountback', ajaxContainer).charcountback();
[03:05:49] <Alina-malina> Cork, this is my php file http://pastebin.com/kYve3f6F   but i am not sure where to put the above line that aurthor mentioned
[03:06:05] <Trisox> thats in the var jqueryAjaxFunctions = function () {
[03:06:12] <Cork> Alina-malina: it's not in there
[03:06:17] <Trisox> thats loaded by default
[03:06:54] <Trisox> so after ajax call been completed it runs the function with in there the functions i need after ajax...
[03:06:58] <iaj> Cork: is that the right approach? http://pastie.org/7906389
[03:06:59] <Cork> Alina-malina: i suspect its in <?=base_url()?>js/main.js
[03:07:31] <Cork> Trisox: yes, but if you have a site
[03:07:39] <Trisox> agreed
[03:07:54] <Cork> with multiple pages, and then you add ajax load ontop of it to make the switching faster
[03:08:11] <Cork> then when the new page loads you need to load the js actions for the new page
[03:08:17] <Trisox> doesnt requirejs support someting like this
[03:08:25] <Cork> and thats where it gets hairy
[03:08:38] <Cork> Trisox: and how do you think it does it?
[03:08:42] <Cork> :)
[03:09:20] <Cork> iaj: yes, though a warning, it will re-evaluate child elements to the a elements when this happens
[03:09:35] <Cork> the script is a bit dumb, but for simple cases it should work
[03:11:01] <Trisox> cork did you see this
[03:11:01] <Trisox> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/CSP_policy_directives
[03:11:12] <Cork> sure
[03:11:26] <Alina-malina> Cork, not sure if i should add those like to that file, dont understand what is going on there
[03:11:29] <Cork> the hole point of using csp is to block unsafe-eval
[03:11:37] <Cork> so that isn't an option
[03:11:51] <Trisox> but self...
[03:11:55] <Cork> Alina-malina: what you showed me was just html, it can't work
[03:11:56] <iaj> strange.. it aint doing anything to the My things :(
[03:11:57] <Trisox> 'self'     Refers to the host from which the protected document is being served, including the same URL scheme and port number. You must include the single quotes.
[03:12:10] <Cork> Trisox: sure, but that doesn't allow ajax execution of scripts
[03:12:15] <Cork> only <script src="url">
[03:12:19] <Trisox> hmm
[03:12:26] <Trisox> yes
[03:12:30] <Cork> and now we have gone full circle to my problem again :)
[03:12:49] <Cork> i'm using <script src=""> but i need to set a header
[03:13:51] <Trisox> what about a runtime file.. like it reverd to above
[03:14:04] <jtbandes> Does anyone have general tips for avoiding really deep call stacks? I built a visualization that processes a certain number of points on screen, but since it does them in order this means (implicitly) really long chains of functions via animate() and such... with too many points it can exceed the browser's limit.
[03:14:08] <seutje> Cork: I take it u don't have control over the server?
[03:14:19] <Cork> seutje: sure i do
[03:14:22] <Cork> so?
[03:14:45] <seutje> I've seen some messed up shit being done with mod_rewrite to "fake" http header information by passing it in the URL
[03:15:17] <seutje> other than that, I don't think there's a lot of options to set http header stuff for a regular <script src> call
[03:15:20] <Cork> seutje: the problem is https://example.com/path/service.js is loaded when the normal page loads
[03:15:45] <Cork> and the X-Requested-With: is used to know that js needs to include the html
[03:16:06] <Cork> (and that the html should just be a partial)
[03:16:49] <Cork> sure i could duplicate the js url and have one for the none js load and one for js load...
[03:16:53] <Cork> but... that sucks
[03:17:35] <Cork> the least hack option i've found this far would be to include a param for "type=ajax" but i'm not found of that either
[03:19:24] <Alina-malina> Cork, i dont change anything in scripts out of the box, just put them into js folder, and i just want to understand where i should put those lines from this saying "Next we need to bind a callback to the "submit" event to gather the form data via the upload row context (the context is set by the UI version of the plugin inside of the add callback to the upload row node):"
[03:20:02] <Trisox> Cork
[03:20:03] <Trisox>  try to make run time script...
[03:20:09] <Cork> Alina-malina: like i said, you need to find where you call the plugin
[03:20:24] <Cork> Trisox: what do you mean?
[03:20:46] <Trisox> 1 sec
[03:23:36] <Alina-malina> Cork, is this the plugin you are talking about? jquery.fileupload-ui.js? what should i look for?
[03:23:41] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/7Bb6j/ like this
[03:23:53] <Trisox> cork or doesnt that solve anything
[03:24:50] <Cork> Alina-malina: that is the plugin, it doesn't activate on it's own you need to run it from somewhere
[03:24:50] <Alina-malina> Cork, http://pastebin.com/kVU9Srcm and this is the main.js file
[03:25:53] <Cork> Trisox: what would that solve?
[03:26:03] <Cork> it doesn't even try to run the script the server sends
[03:27:00] <Trisox> well i tried to say if you replace you script with my ajax ..
[03:27:07] <Trisox> i used it like a wrapper
[03:27:09] <Cork> Trisox: this page has completely different features, and it would have to be more or less one gigantic page if everything should be loaded from start
[03:27:21] <Cork> yes there is functions that the script that is sent calls
[03:27:42] <Cork> but it is still several hundreds of lines of code that would have to be loaded by default
[03:27:56] <Trisox> yes but the function that runs the js script the part above.. is know by page load
[03:27:57] <Cork> and it would be a real mess keeping track of it
[03:28:09] <Cork> yes, that is the problem
[03:28:24] <Trisox> wy is that
[03:28:28] <Cork> i would have to have ~ 14 * 6 soush functions
[03:28:48] <Alina-malina> Cork, please see my message at the end http://pastebin.com/mNuRHKZe
[03:28:50] <Trisox> yes so check if element exist then run... in the runtime
[03:29:03] <Cork> and i would not be able to have a generic page switch function
[03:29:09] <Trisox> or use data-attr's to select the parts you wanna run
[03:29:10] <Cork> as it would have to know what page is loaded
[03:29:31] <Cork> Trisox: but every source would have to know what the target is suppose to do
[03:29:40] <Cork> and if something change they would have to be updated
[03:29:47] <Trisox> no cork is doesnt if you do things on complete
[03:29:55] <Cork> you distribute the code, and that becomes messy fast
[03:30:10] <Trisox> load ajax.. content.. then on complete check the stuff .. page settings that are loaded in
[03:30:15] <Cork> Trisox: yes cause complete would have to know what it is about to load
[03:30:29] <Cork> as the resource on the other end can't tell it
[03:30:33] <Trisox> no curent page doesnt have to know
[03:30:41] <Cork> then how would it run it?
[03:30:46] <Trisox> on complete...
[03:30:53] <Trisox> ajax gets loaded in
[03:30:55] <Cork> that is set in the current page
[03:31:13] <Cork> not the about to be loaded page
[03:31:13] <Trisox> set some data attr's
[03:31:13] <Trisox> no no
[03:31:27] <Trisox> in the loading page
[03:31:32] <Cork> so every link to the page would have to know
[03:31:32] <Trisox> the ajax part
[03:31:34] <Cork> the original page is just an url
[03:31:45] <Trisox> so ;)
[03:31:46] <Cork> it would have to include what functions to call when the other page has loaded, if the resource isn't telling it
[03:32:26] <Trisox> well if you load this
[03:32:29] <Trisox> in ajax
[03:32:31] <Trisox> <div data-loadthisscript="true"> </div>
[03:32:32] <Cork> your approach works really well when the page has just a few different features
[03:32:47] <Cork> but this page has hundreds, and it can't all be loaded on initial load
[03:32:49] <Trisox> if data-loadthisscript on ajax.complete
[03:35:53] <Trisox> lunch
[04:23:36] <quang> hi
[04:29:07] <quang> how do i find the artcile tag in jquery?
[04:30:39] <Sreckins> quang: you mean $('article') ?
[04:32:22] <seutje> what's the best way to get the difference between 2 sets of elements?
[04:33:13] <seutje> say I have var foo = $('.foo'); now I append some, and then I wanna grab a new set and extrapolate the elements that weren't in the first
[04:33:39] <seutje> wonder if I can just $set2.not($set1)
[04:34:02] <Sreckins> that's not how the NOT selector works :)
[04:34:34] <Sreckins> i would append the new elements to both sets
[04:34:57] <Sreckins> or use the data-fields to save when and where you appended someting
[04:35:50] <Sreckins> I would not recommend walking through the whole tree and compare each and every element and its hierarchy
[04:36:40] <seutje> Sreckins: the not() solution does work
[04:37:20] <Sreckins> the not-selector checks if the appointed element has/contains/is a certain element
[04:37:23] <seutje> "append to both sets" not sure what u mean by that, there is only 1 wrapper I'm appending to, I'm just comparing a cached selector to a fresh one to see the difference
[04:38:03] <seutje> not even using the not selector, using the method
[04:38:31] <Sreckins> you could use a regEx
[04:38:36] <seutje> WTF?!
[04:38:38] <seutje> "An existing jQuery object to match the current set of elements against."
[04:38:49] <seutje> that's the docs on .not() btw
[04:39:40] <Sreckins> yeah, like: $('a').not('.external-link')
[04:40:23] <seutje> or like var theOne = $('a.theOne'); var theRest = $('a').not(theOne);
[04:40:41] <seutje> anyway, it works as expected, so thx... I guess
[04:40:55] <Sreckins> hehe :) or not :p
[04:41:18] <seutje> making less sense by the minute :(
[04:44:43] <Chel> question: i have <div>content</div> , i want to split this div for 2 or 3 etc, when content.height() is more than X, is there any implementation with jquery?
[04:46:24] <Arphrial> hey chaps
[04:46:30] <Arphrial> Don't suppose someone could answer a quick Q for me?
[04:48:04] <Arphrial> I'm writing a plugin, but I want it's core functionality to only be defined once across all instances of it. Is there a way to, say, define a function or a variable in the plugin/jquery scope so that you can use/call it in that way?
[04:53:20] <ATField> Can you please help? If a jquery function is affecting the functionality of a tooltip plugin, should I ask about it on jquery forums or the discussion section of the tooltip plugin?
[04:53:26] <jgomes> Chel: no... you have to do it yourself
[04:53:36] <Qdest> Arphrial Â» not sure but take a look at http://jqueryboilerplate.com
[04:54:02] <Sreckins> ATField: ask the plugin author!
[04:54:16] <Chel> jgomes: why myself ?
[04:54:18] <Chel> :D
[04:54:30] <jgomes> Chel: lolol
[04:54:35] <Sreckins> Chel: there's a CSS3-property you could utilize
[04:55:01] <Chel> it doesnot supported by ie8
[04:55:18] <Sreckins> IE9 and earlier actuallyâ€¦
[04:55:19] <Sreckins> http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_multiple_columns.asp
[04:55:53] <jgomes> Chel, Sreckins what property are you guys referring to?
[04:56:00] <Sreckins> column-count
[04:56:26] <ATField> Sreckins: Ok, thanks.
[05:00:28] <jgomes> I didn't know about that column properties... nice one
[05:01:42] <seutje> I made a lil javamascript a while back to fake column support in ie8 & 7, but can't find it anymore q.q
[05:02:39] <jgomes> I bet that there's already a plug-in for that...
[05:03:17] <Sreckins> Chel: http://www.cvwdesign.com/txp/article/360/multi-column-layout-with-css3-and-some-javascript
[05:03:23] <Sreckins> http://martijn.vanderlee.com/?page_id=229
[05:03:30] <seutje> well, there's the polyfill on modernizr wiki: https://github.com/BetleyWhitehorne/CSS3MultiColumn
[05:03:49] <seutje> but u can already see it poses certain limitations
[05:05:33] <jgomes> I found this to, but it only works well for plain text (excluding ordered lists, etc.): http://automagical.rationalmind.net/2011/03/23/cross-browser-multi-columns-with-jquery-and-css3/
[06:04:41] <redshark50> I've created a var to pull .html from a div and then to .append it somewhere else. This worked fine until I added two extra divs within the div I'm copying the data from, any ideas why it wouldn't work
[06:04:50] <redshark50> var p_support = $('.supportTxt').html();
[06:05:46] <redshark50> .supportTxt is the container div with .supportTxt_left and .supportTxt_right in it
[06:06:08] <seutje> redshark50: does this match multiple elements?
[06:06:15] <redshark50> where the text is supposed to be moved to it just says 'undefined'
[06:06:24] <seutje> o.O
[06:06:33] <redshark50> seutje: how do you mean?
[06:06:37] <seutje> does that selector even match anything when it's evaluated
[06:06:43] <redshark50> http://jsfiddle.net/dMfVz/
[06:06:59] <seutje> oh now u suddenly have a fiddle
[06:07:03] <seutje> sweet
[06:08:41] <seutje> redshark50: no jQuery in there
[06:08:47] <seutje> redshark50: $('.supportTxt') doesn't match any elements
[06:09:07] <Sreckins> yeah, there's no HTML element with that class anymore :)
[06:09:08] <redshark50> yeah, just noticed I chopped too much out, two mins I'll make a proper fiddle
[06:09:24] <redshark50> that is actually of use...
[06:11:11] <redshark50> ah okay
[06:11:19] <redshark50> I know why it has no .supportTxt
[06:11:52] <redshark50> it has actually pulled the div but as I've added the two extra internal divs the .supportTxt has no content
[06:12:12] <redshark50> because it's not grabbing the two new divs in the request
[06:12:36] <redshark50> would something like p_support = $('.supportTxt').children().html(); work?
[06:13:26] <Sreckins> what about p_support = $('.supportTxt>div').html();
[06:14:45] <redshark50> still showing 'undefined'
[06:14:59] <redshark50> and leaving the internal div content in the original place
[06:15:23] <Sreckins> I think .html() expects to be fed one element, not multiples
[06:15:52] <Sreckins> you could run an each() inbetween, and asign the html-contents to an array
[06:17:37] <seutje> redshark50: .html() without any arguments will never clear the content of the targetted element
[06:17:50] <Sreckins> or just set a wrapper for those elements and extract that
[06:18:07] <seutje> like $('.foo').html($('.bar').html()); will not remove the html from .bar
[06:18:11] <seutje> it will copy it over
[06:18:42] <seutje> maybe ur looking to store a reference to the .supportTxt element and only grab the HTML when u need it
[06:18:48] <seutje> as it is subject to change
[06:19:24] <redshark50> once the text is inputted it won't be changing, I'll carry on with the fiddle to show
[06:19:38] <seutje> like var $foo = $('.supportTxt'); /* do some shit, add some elements */ $('.somelement').html($foo.html());
[06:26:18] <redshark50> http://jsfiddle.net/dMfVz/2/
[06:26:41] <jimi_> is it possible for .load() to follow 302s
[06:28:02] <redshark50> Does that fiddle help or is it the same answer as Seutje gave above?
[06:28:39] <seutje> redshark50: there's a dropdown on the right for adding popular libraries
[06:28:51] <seutje> only include the content of the body in the html tab
[06:32:21] <redshark50> sorry, new to fiddle. updated one here http://jsfiddle.net/dMfVz/2/
[06:36:33] <seutje> redshark50: $('.sectiondataarea') doesn't match anything
[06:38:28] <seutje> redshark50:  $('.PBLongTxt') doesn't match anything
[06:39:38] <seutje> redshark50: http://jsfiddle.net/dMfVz/4/ threw a .sectiondataarea wrapper around the whole shabang
[06:44:32] <redshark50> here's the full code http://jsfiddle.net/dMfVz/6/ didn't want it so messy for everyone to understand with content not relevant
[06:50:33] <seutje> redshark50: $('.PBLongTxt') doesn't match anything -_-
[06:50:48] <seutje> did you mean "PBMainTxt" ?
[06:52:41] <redshark50> hah, not sure what I mean there...
[06:54:07] <redshark50> let me find it
[06:56:00] <bwen> i'm trying to find a way to do: $('[test*="word1|word2"]'); like a possibility to say it select the element if it the attribute contains either word. Any ideas?
[06:57:17] <quicksilver> bwen: $('[test*=word1],[test*=word2]')
[06:57:36] <seutje> yeah, not that u can match on space separated words
[06:57:39] <seutje> note*
[06:57:48] <seutje> it's like |= or something
[06:58:08] <bwen> quicksilver: yeah I was though of that but I was hoping for something... less lengthy... oh well
[06:58:44] <quicksilver> seutje: |= is the hyphen-prefix thing.
[06:58:55] <quicksilver> contains word (like classes) is ~=
[06:59:23] <seutje> oh
[06:59:27] <quicksilver> bwen: you can just use .filter() and write code if you like
[06:59:30] <seutje> I can never remember the awkward ones
[06:59:39] <quicksilver> personally I think '[test*=word1],[test*=word2]' is fine.
[07:03:08] <redshark50> seutje: the PBLongText is built into the CMS. It's basically the content typed into the WYSIWYG box for the product info.
[07:03:59] <seutje> redshark50: I still have no clue what this is suppose to do
[07:04:55] <redshark50> seutje: yeah, trying to distill it in fiddle to make more sense but just raising more questions
[07:05:22] <seutje> is it supposed to copy content and cause duplicate IDs?
[07:05:24] <Arphrial> Hmm. Quick question.. I have a bunch of different selectors in an array. Is it better to loop through them all and use .add, or loop through them all and then make one selector?
[07:05:40] <seutje> Arphrial: jsperf it
[07:05:43] <seutje> prolly the second
[07:05:54] <seutje> as that could be reduced to a single qSA call
[07:06:05] <Arphrial> Yeah, was what I was thinking.
[07:06:17] <redshark50> seutje: yes, it's meant to copy content of a div and duplicate it into a different div
[07:06:25] <seutje> best test it urself though, I'm a returd
[07:06:41] <redshark50> which is does fine, until I add two more divs within the holder div
[07:06:52] <seutje> redshark50: u know IDs are suppose to be unique, right?
[07:06:53] <redshark50> it's not copying the internal/child divs over
[07:06:53] <tomasm-> hi, anyone know if it's possible to see exactly how text in a paragraph wraps, ie what words are on what lines, etc? I know there are ways to check for width/height beyond the container as per overflowing... but wasnt sure if there was a library ,etc
[07:06:57] <redshark50> yes
[07:07:11] <redshark50> it's all classes that need copying
[07:08:19] <seutje> redshark50: so it's suppose to copy content over, and it doesn... what's the problem?
[07:08:52] <redshark50> it's not copying the content of the child divs over
[07:09:45] <redshark50> I will have to do each one separately maybe? copy holder div, then copy left div into that holder, then copy right div into that holder?
[07:10:23] <redshark50> I thought there might have been a way to grab a whole div and it's contents and duplicate it elsewhere
[07:10:47] <seutje> redshark50: $('.supportTxt') is.still.not.matching.anything -_-
[07:10:50] <seutje> I'm done
[07:10:59] <chiefbrain> can somebody have a look at this fiddle and tell me, why my second thead has not the right width? element.style has the right properities, but the computed layout is not affected: http://jsfiddle.net/PMrut/1/
[07:11:17] <chiefbrain> redshark50 tried .clone(true, true) ?
[07:11:49] <redshark50> seutje: that's because of the $('.supportTxt').remove
[07:12:09] <redshark50> after it's copied the contents
[07:12:50] <seutje> wow...
[07:13:30] <seutje> redshark50: this is the markup before JS has touched it: http://pastebin.com/hQ5uBU6H
[07:13:49] <seutje> now show me where this magical supportTxt shit is
[07:13:59] <seutje> cause my "find" function can't find it
[07:14:05] <redshark50> chill man
[07:14:51] <redshark50> I'm working within such a convoluted ecommerce CMS you wouldn't believe the 'fixes' I've had to create
[07:15:08] <seutje> why do I even bother, doesn't even believe me when I say something
[07:15:10] <redshark50> adding a class to a td to be able to then remove that td
[07:15:17] <seutje> try clone like the other guy said
[07:15:20] <redshark50> mate, I do and I appreciate your help
[07:15:26] <seutje> lets see if cloning a non-existent element fixes it
[07:15:39] <redshark50> if I could show you the CMS it would slot into place
[07:17:27] <chiefbrain> can somebody have a look at this fiddle and tell me, why my second thead has not the right width? element.style has the right properities, but the computed layout is not affected: http://jsfiddle.net/PMrut/2/. sry, the first version had an error
[07:18:07] <seutje> chiefbrain: sounds like a padding issue
[07:22:31] <Saaether> chiefbrain its a problem with your repositioning, if you take that part out it works fine http://jsfiddle.net/PMrut/4/
[07:22:59] <seutje> yeah, the fixed is fucking with it cause then the total width isn't the same as the original
[07:33:27] <kaylee1> anyone happen to have experience using jTable and can give me a hand with getting a parent table to refresh when a child row is changed?
[07:35:27] <the-noob> hi, I've created a custom jquery function and I was wondering if it's possible to make it behave as the events registered with $('parent').on('action', 'sub-selector', ..)
[07:36:42] <kosibar> How would I get all of the values of a form to use as POST data?
[07:36:58] <Saaether> $('form').serialize();
[07:38:44] <kosibar> I have an object representation of data that is not part of the form like this: { page: 'test', command: 'test' } so how would I incorporate the query-string-like .serialize() data with my own object?
[07:39:48] <Saaether> save the serialized data to a var and then just tac on what ever additional data that you want to the end
[07:43:15] <kosibar> It looks like I can use .serializeArray() then just .push() my own object onto that. That might be the better way to handle it. Thanks, Saaether, for pointing me in the right direction!
[07:44:45] <the-noob> sorry if I repeat, got disconnected and not sure you guys received
[07:44:51] <the-noob> I've created a custom jquery function and I was wondering if it's possible to make it behave as the events registered with $('parent').on('action', 'sub-selector', ..)
[07:45:06] <min|dvir|us> the-noob: what's the question?
[07:45:44] <the-noob> as in, my function , registered with $('selector').myFunction() , to be called on a DOM change by ajax
[07:46:28] <hawtin> hi need some help over here someone ?
[07:46:31] <xec_> you can't listen to DOM changes. (.on() doesn't either)
[07:46:40] <NoiseEee> the-noob: no, you call that function in your ajax response.
[07:47:06] <xec_> ?ask @ hawtin
[07:47:06] <bot-t> hawtin, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:47:13] <hawtin> i need to make this work with jquery. for the moment being I have it working with css3
[07:47:15] <hawtin> http://jsfiddle.net/melbourne/25cCG/2/
[07:49:08] <hawtin> I need to make it work with jq because it only works on chrome and safari. no firefox no opera no nothing :)
[07:49:09] <xec_> hawtin: that's quite the handful of css - what part are you talking about?
[07:49:11] <hawtin> the jquery part
[07:49:13] <hawtin> I need when the button is checked to set a different background
[07:49:14] <hawtin> when it is uncheck to normal
[07:49:15] <hawtin> back to *
[07:49:16] <the-noob> thanks
[07:49:25] <xec_> ?addclass @ hawtin
[07:49:28] <Saaether> works fine in chrome heh
[07:49:35] <hawtin> in chrome works
[07:49:35] <hawtin> the css3
[07:49:39] <bot-t> hawtin, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[07:49:40] <hawtin> not the jquery code
[07:49:48] <xec_> hawtin: .addClass() takes (a list of) classname(s) - not a selector...
[07:50:10] <xec_> hawtin: also, if you want to run jquery in jsfiddle, make sure to select it from the frameworks dropdown
[07:50:24] <hawtin> right
[07:50:27] <hawtin> forgot about that one
[07:50:34] <fission6> anyone have  a rec, i have small static site but have a contact us form., need a rec for a 3rd party service to handle contact form
[07:50:43] <hawtin> so the code is good. I only need to use a class
[07:50:45] <hawtin> and that's all ?
[07:50:54] <xec_> hawtin: i have no idea what you're trying to make it do...
[07:51:22] <hawtin> when you click the button switch to another background
[07:51:54] <hawtin> its a checkbox type, checked this background, unchecked this backgrund
[07:51:58] <hawtin> o*
[07:54:14] <xec_> hawtin: http://jsfiddle.net/25cCG/4/
[07:54:41] <xec_> i removed the unneccessary css
[07:54:55] <xec_> unnecessary* ?
[07:55:16] <hawtin> that looks like it
[07:55:19] <hawtin> thanks
[07:55:22] <hawtin> I'll work on it
[07:55:24] <hawtin> :)
[07:58:22] <xec_> on second thought, any self-respecting script should be on one line, really http://jsfiddle.net/25cCG/5/
[07:59:58] <Aamir> hawtin: even shorter http://jsfiddle.net/25cCG/6/
[08:00:09] <Aamir> :P
[08:00:54] <xec_> lol
[08:01:13] <xec_> <3 Aamir
[08:01:14] <hawtin> :))
[08:01:45] <Aamir> ;)
[08:19:47] <tomasm-> anyone know of a decent font picker or other customizable/stylable dropdown menu system?
[08:21:55] <roy_raider> hi, I have a problem with a javascript, he works well for all my loaded elem
[08:22:06] <roy_raider> but element loaded by the javascript
[08:22:13] <roy_raider> don't work with the javascript
[08:23:06] <pachet> he's a good worker
[08:23:11] <pachet> but gosh darn sometimes he makes me so mad
[08:24:06] <roy_raider> I mean, i have like 10 block with an click event, it work well with these block, but if i load 10 more block with a javascript, theres elements don't have the click event, nothing happen when i click on them
[08:24:06] <shoky> >:-|
[08:24:06] <roy_raider> any idea ?
[08:24:32] <pachet> roy_raider google event delegation
[08:24:33] <shoky> roy_raider read about event delegation here - see ?on
[08:24:35] <pachet> ?.on()
[08:24:41] <roy_raider> thanks
[08:24:41] <shoky> :D
[08:24:53] <pachet> bot-t is at seaworld this week

[08:25:17] <pachet> there we are
[08:25:20] <iaj> does someone know whats wrong with that one:  http://pastie.org/7907378
[08:25:23] <shoky> ?botsnack
[08:25:23] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[08:25:31] <pachet> responds quick enough to that
[08:25:37] <pachet> its a motivation issue!
[08:25:40] <shoky> ;]
[08:25:46] <iaj> I want all the My 's that are within an a tag to be replaced with <span class="blue">My</span>
[08:26:20] <iaj> nvm, solved.
[08:27:04] <shoky> why the $1 if it's always My ;p
[08:28:12] <shoky> stupid question, i should be ashamed
[08:32:43] <houser> Hello, according to this: http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop_API.html there should be a 'ready' function for jquery - however it seems its not beeing invoked. What am I missing? http://jsfiddle.net/GB9bF/10/
[08:35:37] <shoky> houser: you're missing $(document).ready(...)
[08:36:21] <houser> shoky, no thats already implicit in jsfiddle
[08:36:35] <shoky> houser: only if you choose that option in the selectbox on the left
[08:36:45] <shoky> houser: in your fiddle it's on 'No wrap - in <head>'
[08:37:34] <houser> ah you are right
[08:37:56] <rocky> this is odd... when i call ajax() on a page that doesn't exist (ie the server isn't running) my fail() callback isn't getting run... am i missing/forgetting something
[08:38:27] <shoky> rocky: check your browser's devtools network tab to see what's up with the request
[08:38:39] <roy_raider> ok i read about event delegation
[08:38:50] <roy_raider> so i have to chose the parent always display at the begin
[08:39:01] <rocky> shoky, there's no response from the request since the server that is serving the page isn't running
[08:39:02] <roy_raider> and use target ?
[08:39:13] <shoky> rocky: what's the status of the request?
[08:39:39] <rocky> shoky, there is no status... the server isn't running that the ajax request is running against
[08:40:11] <jgomes> rocky you should get a 500 server not found
[08:40:13] <shoky> rocky: just because there is no response doesn't mean there is no request
[08:40:33] <shoky> if there is no request, that would explain why fail() isn't getting run ;P
[08:40:34] <rocky> in chrome dev tools i get a "(failed)" as the STATUS
[08:41:00] <shoky> then something is prolly wrong. pastebin your code or smth
[08:41:27] <rocky> server1 is hosting the javascript that makes a jsonp request against a url on server2 ... server2 isn't running... in chrome devtools i get the classic red error that  the request didn't work but the Status is (failed)
[08:41:36] <shoky> ah jsonp.
[08:41:40] <shoky> that would explain it
[08:41:57] <shoky> no fail() for jsonp
[08:42:08] <rocky> fail() works if jsonp returns something other than javascript
[08:42:14] <rocky> but apparently not if the server doesn't exist
[08:42:16] <shoky> jsonp = a <script> element
[08:42:22] <maxmoore14> does jquery still use uglifyjs for compression?
[08:42:34] <rocky> yes i know... and if jsonp returns <html> instead of <script> then fail() works
[08:42:47] <shoky> rocky: that's another type of error
[08:43:02] <maxmoore14> is that considered "best of" these days? or do people like Google Closure better?
[08:43:10] <shoky> rocky: jquery can't know if the <script> didn't load at all
[08:43:18] <maxmoore14> my understanding is yui compressor is dead
[08:43:22] <rocky> oh i c
[08:43:24] <rocky> i understand now
[08:43:45] <shoky> i'm not 100% sure about all i said now, so best to go read about it :P
[08:43:52] <RNT> hi, can somebody helps me with http://pastebin.com/zvPEUcjR please?
[08:43:57] <houser> how can i change the images from the clickhandler? http://jsfiddle.net/GB9bF/16/
[08:44:49] <shoky> maxmoore14 yeah jquery use uglify
[08:45:08] <maxmoore14> shoky: v1 or v2?
[08:45:31] <maxmoore14> shoky: also, do you know what they use for css min?
[08:46:37] <shoky> maxmoore14 i donno, see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Gruntfile.js and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
[08:47:01] <jgomes> rocky: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1002367/jquery-ajax-jsonp-ignores-a-timeout-and-doesnt-fire-the-error-event
[08:47:19] <maxmoore14> shoky: thx
[08:47:38] <reed> RNT: What does "has no return" mean?
[08:49:41] <jgomes> RNT: put the alert after line 6 (inside the success function)
[08:50:48] <RNT> if i put the alert there, is ok, but i want the $data to be global
[08:51:05] <reed> RNT: Then take out the "var"
[08:51:06] <RNT> i think i forgot to call the function, i'm right?
[08:51:51] <jgomes> RNT: no, ajax requests are async so $data is only available after the request completes
[08:52:18] <diverdude> how can i change the images from the clickhandler? http://jsfiddle.net/GB9bF/16/
[08:53:05] <jgomes> RNT: and after it completes that function is called and pam $data is available after that
[08:53:23] <jgomes> RNT: got it?
[08:53:54] <RNT> jgomes, i don't need the alert messagem, just data...
[08:54:15] <RNT> i have to add a succes function ?
[08:54:49] <jgomes> RNT: I jnow... but you're alerting $data
[08:55:32] <jgomes> RNT: the success function is the second parameter of $.get function
[08:55:34] <RNT> jgomes, you said 1. remove var $data from line
[08:55:53] <RNT> 2. $data will be available after succes
[08:56:05] <RNT> from line 3*
[08:56:30] <RNT> right?
[08:56:47] <jgomes> RNT: I said:  put the alert after line 6 (inside the success function)
[08:57:01] <RNT> jgomes, but why to put alert?
[08:58:25] <jgomes> RNT: look my point is, the $data is only available after line 6 (no matter if you're alerting it or not)
[08:58:28] <RNT> maybe is a wrong aproch, i don't think i need ajax, i need to have $data available before everyting else
[08:58:59] <RNT> approach*
[09:00:03] <jgomes> RNT: $data is defined on line 3, so it is available, but $data.name is not
[09:02:09] <diverdude> I am trying to figure out how i can change the jcrop image from a button click handler. I can find the correct image: http://jsfiddle.net/EjEcN/1/ but how can i then change the image to something else?
[09:03:51] <jgomes> RNT: do you know what async means right... you could make a synced ajax call but I don't recomend it
[09:04:12] <RNT> jgomes, what i can do instead?
[09:05:09] <RNT> look, supposing is like now, how come i can do something like "if($data) { .. } ;"
[09:05:54] <RNT> just put all after  $data = data ?
[09:06:29] <min|dvir|us> jgomes, RNT: you cannot make a sync AJAX call.
[09:06:40] <diverdude> are we dead?
[09:07:15] <min|dvir|us> RNT: what's the problem?
[09:08:07] <jgomes> RNT: look if you want to make $data global, he already is... but he only has $data.name after the ajax request ends, that's why you can only access $data.name inside the success success function, because there you're sure the request already terminate successfully
[09:09:23] <RNT> jgomes, i think i got it, thank you very much
[09:09:25] <RNT> :)
[09:10:12] <RNT> min|dvir|us i solve it i guess, i wanted all my script runs after $data.parameter is available
[09:10:13] <jgomes> RNT: no problem, glad you figured out
[09:10:42] <min|dvir|us> RNT: execute a callback when $data.parameter is available.
[09:10:48] <min|dvir|us> RNT: callback($data.parameter);
[09:11:03] <min|dvir|us> Do not use global state.
[09:11:43] <and03> .
[09:11:44] <RNT> what do you mean callback($data.parameter) ? how to use this?
[09:12:13] <min|dvir|us> RNT: define `function callback (paramter) {}`, then call it when $data.parameter is ready.
[09:12:35] <min|dvir|us> That is the continuating passing style (CPS) that programmers know and love.
[09:15:21] <and03> why im not able to get "this" in the example? http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/4/
[09:16:05] <min|dvir|us> and03: your example is broken.
[09:16:14] <wilkinsmc> I followed an ajax/php form tutorial that sends the form to my email. I'm using wampserver, and when nothing is filled out i get an error message, but when something is in the form the page just reloads.
[09:16:32] <wilkinsmc> i'm not sure how to ensure that the thing is actually working
[09:18:59] <xhoy> wilkinsmc: so when i dont fill the form it returns an error
[09:19:13] <xhoy> but when i fill in ONE part of the page then it reloads
[09:19:14] <xhoy> ?
[09:20:04] <min|dvir|us> That's what you get when you follow a tutorial without any understanding of what the code actually does.
[09:20:10] <min|dvir|us> 100% chance that nobody here will be able to help.
[09:20:38] <min|dvir|us> If I were you I'd avoid all tutorials regarding PHP, because 99% of them are written by skiddos, and it's hard to tell the difference.
[09:20:41] <djQuery> This seems to work on everything except keypress $(document).on('keypress', function(e){ console.log(e); return false;});
[09:20:56] <min|dvir|us> djQuery: e.preventDefault();
[09:21:18] <gkilian> I can help
[09:21:44] <djQuery> min|dvir|us  not having a problem with it not returning false it doesn't log at all on the arrow keys
[09:21:57] <min|dvir|us> djQuery: use .keydown().
[09:22:04] <min|dvir|us> Or .on('keydown').
[09:22:25] <djQuery> min|dvir|us  will that fire repeatedly if they hold the key down?
[09:22:40] <min|dvir|us> djQuery: no, but you can emulate the behavior using setTimeout/Interval.
[09:23:34] <djQuery> min|dvir|us  thanks it does fire repeatedly if you hold the key
[09:23:40] <djQuery> and it fires on arrows
[09:23:51] <min|dvir|us> It shouldn't fire repeatedly.
[09:24:08] <djQuery> wonder why keypress doesn't capture arrow but keydown does
[09:24:30] <djQuery> I want it to capture holding the key down. building pong
[09:24:43] <min|dvir|us> djQuery: then use .keydown() and .keyup().
[09:24:48] <min|dvir|us> That is The Right Way.
[09:25:55] <and03> ?
[09:28:23] <gkilian> join php
[09:29:18] <wilkinsmc> i'm going to redo the tutorials and just cross my fingers
[09:29:38] <min|dvir|us> That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[09:29:41] <djQuery> whats wrong with just relying on keydown to fire repeatedly and doing my animation once for everytime it fires while the key is held down
[09:29:41] <wilkinsmc> this is the one i'm using: http://www.spruce.it/noise/simple-ajax-contact-form/  .. can someone look at real fast and see if it's skiddo material
[09:29:44] <min|dvir|us> "cross my fingers"
[09:29:52] <min|dvir|us> There is no finger-crossing in programming.
[09:29:53] <djQuery> min|dvir|us  ^^
[09:30:02] <wilkinsmc> i don't want to learn php if i don't have to
[09:30:06] <wilkinsmc> i'll never use it after this form
[09:30:18] <min|dvir|us> wilkinsmc: 1) you're in the wrong place. #php
[09:30:18] <djQuery> wilkinsmc, php is pretty easy
[09:30:28] <djQuery> would prefer using node.js though
[09:30:30] <min|dvir|us> wilkinsmc: 2) that is the most ignorant thing you can say. I sincerely hope nobody helps you.
[09:30:39] <wilkinsmc> ok, well, i value my time
[09:30:44] <min|dvir|us> Your time is worthless.
[09:30:46] <wilkinsmc> and have already spent a month on this site
[09:31:09] <min|dvir|us> wilkinsmc: how can you value your time if you spent a month on a form that doesn't even work yet?
[09:31:17] <min|dvir|us> Sit down and learn.
[09:31:23] <min|dvir|us> You are not better than everyone.
[09:31:45] <afrance> Well, if your page is just reloading I'm going out on a limb and saying the first part of the problem has nothing to do with the php side and has to do with your js...
[09:31:53] <min|dvir|us> djQuery: you have no control over it.
[09:32:12] <min|dvir|us> djQuery: if you use keydown and keyup you have complete control.
[09:32:16] <min|dvir|us> And your events are atomic.
[09:32:31] <min|dvir|us> As soon as the key goes down, the event is triggered; as soon as the key goes up, the event is triggered.
[09:32:38] <afrance> once you get the ajax part of the request working you might find some issues with your php portion but until you get a request sent and response received without a reload your js isn't working.
[09:33:22] <wilkinsmc> min: i spent a month on the site, not the form. Actually, my bad, when I click nothing happens if the message doesn't satisfy the filter requirements in the js
[09:33:24] <afrance> So, I'm not sure where PHP and the desire to not learn anything about it is really comeing from.
[09:33:52] <wilkinsmc> if the message does satisfy the filter requirements nothing happens*
[09:33:58] <min|dvir|us> afrance: well, in all fairness, PHP sucks.
[09:34:01] <wilkinsmc> if it doesn't, then i get the error message i programmed
[09:35:12] <tomasm-> hi, I'm noticing a problem with a:hover on a custom font-face.... this is from typekit.com ... some fonts will hover fine but a particular font won't hover unless you're outside of the text itself, ie on the whitespace to the right.... it wont let you hover/select/click on it properly. I know it has something to do with the font itself, both FF and IE have this issue... any idea if im missing something?
[09:35:56] <diverdude> , why do i get an error when a button is clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/EjEcN/3/
[09:36:29] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-: display: inline-block or display: block.
[09:36:38] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, display block is set
[09:36:52] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, and it's just one of several that's doing this, same styling
[09:37:02] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, and it only hovers OUTSIDE of the text
[09:37:05] <afrance> diverdude: because Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[09:37:14] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-: do you have an example page?
[09:37:25] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, give me a few mins
[09:37:54] <Saaether> diverdude http://jsfiddle.net/EjEcN/2/$(function(){ <- issue
[09:41:30] <robk> question, when I run: this.element.find('input[type=file].upload-current-file').trigger('click'); I get: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'apply' from chrome, and FF says: TypeError: handler.apply is not a function, what am I doing wrong?
[09:41:38] <diverdude> Saaether, that was obviously a typo. here is the actual example: http://jsfiddle.net/EjEcN/5/
[09:41:57] <motaka2> how can I make sure that something is comming from $(...)
[09:42:10] <robk> I successfully simulate a button click on a input[type=file] element, but it produces this weired error with jquery
[09:42:11] <Saaether> diverdude you're calling a function that doesnt exist
[09:42:15] <min|dvir|us> robk: likely one of your handlers is fuckered.
[09:42:20] <Saaether> *method
[09:42:30] <Saaether>  Object [object Object] has no method 'setImage'
[09:42:40] <robk> hmm..
[09:43:22] <min|dvir|us> robk: most likely you're passing an object for a handler instead of a function.
[09:43:36] <diverdude> Saaether, how then do i change the image?
[09:45:42] <wilkinsmc> when setting an ajax url from a javascript document, am i getting to the php file from the javascript document or the main directory?
[09:46:08] <Saaether> diverdude you mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/EjEcN/7/
[09:47:00] <diverdude> Saaether, yeah but that does not work :(
[09:47:22] <Saaether> the first part does, i dont know what jcrop does so i wasnt sure what to do there
[09:47:24] <tirengarfio> any help with my carrousel that does not work in ie8? http://77.240.118.188/ Im using this plugin for the carrousel: http://www.catchmyfame.com/catchmyfame-jquery-plugins/jquery-infinite-carousel-plugin/
[09:47:35] <tirengarfio> It is supposed it works in IE8, but not for me..
[09:47:52] <tirengarfio> is the first time I try to check some jquery plugin in IE8, maybe is the configuration somewhere?
[09:48:10] <diverdude> Saaether, if i select area of the image after change in your example the old image reappears
[09:48:40] <afrance> wilkinsmc: to the url that will process the request
[09:51:22] <afrance> wilkinsmc: the file/folder structure on the server doesn't really mean anything since something like /var/www/path/to/php/that/process/the/form.php could be anything from the clients perspective, it could be www.example.com/path/to/php/that/process/the/form.php or it could be www.example.com/contact
[09:54:23] <tirengarfio> any help?
[09:54:53] <tirengarfio> does it work for you in ie8?
[09:56:39] <Sendoushi> guys... i have this line $j('div.buttons a.js_open').hover

[09:56:57] <Sendoushi> isn't there a selector like || operator?
[09:57:06] <min|dvir|us> Sendoushi: ,
[09:57:21] <Sendoushi> it works inside jquery selector? niceee
[09:57:33] <min|dvir|us> Sendoushi: jQuery supports all CSS selectors and then some.
[09:57:42] <Sendoushi> ok thanks :)

[10:11:42] <bot-t> http://w3fools.com
[10:15:02] <BillCriswell> ah, webplatform is coming along nice.
[10:18:22] <robk> min|dvir|us-work: thanks
[10:18:26] <robk> you were right on the money
[10:21:47] <Jack_q> any idea why im not getting the correct element here http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/6/
[10:25:43] <djQuery> min|dvir|us-work, http://jsbin.com/oqobil/1/edit
[10:25:45] <wilkinsmc> I got a success message from my javascript that was only to be launch if the ajax posting was successful
[10:25:52] <wilkinsmc> to be launched*
[10:25:59] <wilkinsmc> but since on wampserver the email wasn't sent
[10:26:03] <djQuery> just binding to keydown with no keyup seems to work find
[10:26:06] <wilkinsmc> i wonder if i'm pretty much good to go
[10:26:12] <djQuery> fine rather
[10:26:21] <Saaether> Jack_q ['aaa','bbb','ccc'] isnt a url
[10:26:42] <min|dvir|us-work> djQuery: I'm glad it works for you, but it's wrong.
[10:26:59] <min|dvir|us-work> When you press down, it should smoothly move the paddle down every x ms.
[10:27:38] <djQuery> min|dvir|us-work, why the original wasnt smooth
[10:28:29] <Jack_q> Saaether i know but even having a url i get the same thing.. im just wondering why im not able to get the element in that specific option of the autocomplete
[10:29:05] <LukePOLO> Using new Date(); , should return whats based on my windows clock , correct?
[10:31:24] <Saaether> Jack_q what are you trying to do?
[10:32:03] <BillCriswell> Jack_q: Make sure you know what this is
[10:32:24] <Jack_q> Saaether i only want to get this
[10:32:31] <BillCriswell> Jack_q: Wait... were you in here under a different nick with this problem?
[10:32:31] <Saaether> Jack_q in your example "this" is the function
[10:33:49] <Jack_q> BillCriswell yes,, still struggling
[10:34:59] <graphettion> Caught red handed! lol jk
[10:35:19] <BillCriswell> Jack_q: http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/7/ this could do what you'd like
[10:35:42] <BillCriswell> If I wasn't clear enough you should have let me know, could have tried explaining it a little differently.
[10:36:41] <Jack_q> BillCriswell i only get this problem in the source option.. otherwise it works fine
[10:37:13] <Jack_q> BillCriswell umm.. try typing something in the second field.. the alert is not showing anything
[10:39:27] <Saaether> sure it is, it is returning the div
[10:40:23] <kaylee1> I've got a form in a dialog, very similar to the Modal form example, http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[10:40:49] <kaylee1> can anyone point me in the right direction to making the form submit when the user hits enter?
[10:40:53] <Jack_q> oh well.. scott gonzalez told me that the source has no specified context
[10:41:11] <kaylee1> (it doesn't seem to submit on enter in this example either)
[10:41:14] <BillCriswell> Jack_q: http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/8/
[10:42:06] <dewdrop> Hi, is the jquery docs website down? I am trying to view the page: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Explode
[10:42:18] <BillCriswell> dewdrop: Appears so.
[10:42:35] <dewdrop> Even the cached website on google is not opening for me.
[10:42:54] <dewdrop> got the cached webpage now.

[10:47:32] <reed> ?eval print("I'm no bot, I'm a free man!")
[10:47:36] <bot-t> reed: "I'm no bot, I'm a free man!"
[10:51:45] <wilkinsmc> before, i was either getting the ajax fail message or no message at all. Now all i'm getting is the success message, even when nothing is filled out
[10:51:56] <wilkinsmc> i think i'm ready to put my site live :p
[10:52:04] <reed> :-D
[10:53:25] <wilkinsmc> i dunno, man, this is taking so long. I've been making such huge progress and have been stopped in my tracks by php & ajax
[10:53:35] <BillCriswell> Jack_q: http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/9/ does this help?
[10:53:59] <reed> wilkinsmc: Welcome to Development.
[10:54:08] <reed> specifically, Arrested Development
[10:58:27] <fission6> for done, i get the response back for fail() i get the response object is that correct?
[10:58:38] <Jack_q> BillCriswell give me just a sec.. ill try it out
[11:04:34] <tomasm-> hi, how do I prevent the 'click' handler for 'html' to be called when I click on something in specific?  preventDefault() ? stopPropagation? stopImmediatePropagation()  ? i never can remember
[11:04:54] <min|dvir|us-work> tomasm-: be more specific.
[11:04:59] <Jack_q> BillCriswell works.. but lets say i have multiple fields with the same class autogenerated it always get the same value for all the fields
[11:05:03] <wilkinsmc> does anyone know if ever-present success messages with ajax on local servers are a good sign?
[11:05:15] <wilkinsmc> it is just ignoring my filters
[11:05:25] <mattyh88> hey, with modernizr, i'm getting "Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type application/x-javascript". Can this be solved? I've tried adding "AddType application/x-javascript .js" but that didn't do anything.
[11:05:39] <chilversc> wilkinsmc: ever present success messages?
[11:05:44] <min|dvir|us-work> mattyh88: other way around.
[11:05:48] <min|dvir|us-work> Your images are being sent as JS.
[11:06:11] <wilkinsmc> every time i press the send I get an ajax success message
[11:06:28] <wilkinsmc> but it seems to be ignoring the filters i set up to make sure there is text in the fields
[11:06:33] <wilkinsmc> i never get the error message
[11:06:42] <wilkinsmc> last time i did this i only ever got the error message or nothing at all
[11:07:00] <mattyh88> min|dvir|us-work: what should i put?
[11:07:15] <chilversc> wilkinsmc: that sounds like an issue with the server code then rather than the client javascript?
[11:07:40] <BillCriswell> Jack_q: Use .each, http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/10/
[11:07:44] <wilkinsmc> i hope so
[11:07:51] <wilkinsmc> i get nothing in every case without wampserver
[11:08:04] <wilkinsmc> and with wampserver success every time
[11:08:13] <wilkinsmc> no matter if i draw a penis in the email thing instead of an email
[11:08:13] <BillCriswell> Jack_q: What do you need from the fieldwrapper?
[11:10:48] <fission6> is there an off the cuff way of disable all fields in a form
[11:11:19] <BillCriswell> fission6: $('form :input').prop('disabled', true);
[11:11:22] <BillCriswell> I think.
[11:11:24] <BillCriswell> Seems odd.
[11:12:13] <mattyh88> my jQuery ui css isn't always being loaded. I'm using modernizr. Is this a known issue?
[11:12:35] <Jack_q> BillCriswell each was the solution.. the code is a mess anyways.. thanks buddy
[11:12:52] <mattyh88> well jQuery UI is loaded, but like the sliders aren't initialised
[11:12:54] <BillCriswell> No problem at all Jack_q!
[11:13:33] <chilversc> wilkinsmc: remember, the jquery success/error handlers are based upon the HTTP status, and php has a lovely habbit of giving you 200 OK with an empty response when things go wrong
[11:14:05] <BillCriswell> mattyh88: If there's an error in the modernizr script it could be halting things.
[11:14:37] <BillCriswell> fission6: http://jsfiddle.net/YqnkM/
[11:14:49] <Saaether> you could also use attr to disable the form elements $('form :input').attr('disabled', true);
[11:14:58] <mattyh88> BillCriswell, sometimes it gets loaded and sometimes doesn'
[11:15:05] <mattyh88> so can't be an error really?
[11:15:24] <BillCriswell> mattyh88: Are you using Modernizr.load() ?
[11:15:31] <mattyh88> BillCriswell: yes
[11:16:10] <BillCriswell> Ok, is your code set up so it's definitely running after jquery-ui is ready?
[11:17:21] <BillCriswell> SHould be like... Modernizr.load([{ jquery }, { jquery-ui }, { app-init });  and definitely not Modernizr.load({ jquery }); Modernizr.load({ jquery-ui }); Modernizr.load({ app-init });
[11:17:40] <BillCriswell> Cause you can't guarantee some shit'll be available.
[11:18:14] <BillCriswell> or in the complete callback of the jquery-ui load.
[11:18:21] <fission6> thanks BillCriswell
[11:19:17] <BillCriswell> fission6: No problem.
[11:19:28] <mattyh88> BillCriswell: it's like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5578196
[11:22:07] <BillCriswell> mattyh88: Does things in main.js depend on things from plugins.js?
[11:23:13] <mattyh88> BillCriswell: yeh
[11:25:54] <BillCriswell> mattyh88: Hmmm
[11:27:37] <BillCriswell> mattyh88: I'd need to see what's going on in the console.
[11:27:54] <BillCriswell> I'm not super familiar with modernizr to be honest.
[11:28:06] <mattyh88> ok, np :) thx for looking
[11:28:11] <BillCriswell> It seems like it should be working, though.
[11:28:36] <mattyh88> yeh .. sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't load the slider .. strange .. didn't have that issue on previous host
[11:30:16] <BillCriswell> mattyh88: Are the files being cached properly? Looking at the "Things to keep in mind" section here: http://yepnopejs.com/
[11:31:36] <mattyh88> BillCriswell: what do you mean with cached properly? How do I know? :)
[11:34:11] <BillCriswell> take a look at the http headers and see if the Expires header is set in the future.
[11:36:53] <mattyh88> BillCriswell: Expires: Tue, 14 May 2013 17:43:16 GMT
[11:36:55] <mattyh88> can't be right
[11:37:40] <mattyh88> ah but the one for jquery-ui.css is set correctly in the future (13 Jun 2013)
[11:38:32] <mattyh88> and why do some js files haven't got any response headers?
[11:39:00] <BillCriswell> they might be from cache
[11:46:14] <citizen_stig> hello, could you please help me. how can jquery access html tag attributes?
[11:46:14] <citizen_stig> http://jsfiddle.net/pGmuj/1/
[11:47:58] <reed> citizen_stig: Did you mean to use a click handler? http://jsfiddle.net/pGmuj/2/
[11:49:00] <BillCriswell> citizen_stig: $el.attr('name')
[11:50:57] <citizen_stig> reed: no, i don't need a click handler, i need somethig would work on page load
[11:51:18] <citizen_stig> i've changed it to each and it works
[11:51:24] <citizen_stig> i mean handler
[11:51:41] <reed> citizen_stig: Ah there you go, yes. the Ready function inside the Ready function was blowing my mind :)
[11:52:16] <citizen_stig> thank you for advice with handler
[11:52:40] <reed> Aye
[12:21:34] <Pavlov> are there any tips or tricks to making pages not jiggle when using jquery mobile?
[12:22:27] <reed1> Pavlov: You should always be sitting when using jQuery. It only jiggles when you go mobile.
[12:22:32] <Pavlov> heh
[12:22:41] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please. I'm using UI Dialog. Is it possible to customize the modal? See screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/t5poj3ilr/
[12:22:42] <Pavlov> namely, the header and footer move a bit
[12:23:48] <reed1> Pavlov: My only suggestion is the newer "fixed" header and footer, but I'm guessing youre using those already
[12:24:13] <Pavlov> yeah, i am
[12:24:18] <Pavlov> it just jiggles a bit
[12:24:20] <Pavlov> before settling back in
[12:24:50] <reed1> You've expended my usefulness then :(
[12:28:33] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please. I'm using UI Dialog. Is it possible to customize the modal? See screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/t5poj3ilr/
[12:44:07] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please. I'm using UI Dialog. Is it possible to customize the modal? See screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/t5poj3ilr/
[12:44:22] <wer0ckz> do i need to adjust the opacity of a specific class on that page?
[12:45:10] <reed1> Customize what exactly?
[12:46:30] <wer0ckz> i want to adjust the opacity of the specific part of my page
[12:46:40] <wer0ckz> please see screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/t5poj3ilr/
[12:47:30] <reed1> Oh I didn't see the note
[12:47:42] <saml> jQuery.ajax  on success, I am appending some elements. how do I register clickevents?
[12:48:06] <wer0ckz> reed1: is it possible?
[12:48:35] <reed1> You want that section to not be "grayed out"?
[12:48:35] <wer0ckz> that box has a specific class. i was wondering if i can adjust the opacity of the modal/overlay
[12:48:37] <pachet> success : function ( data ) { $whatever.append(data); $whatever.find('a').on('click.mynamespace', function ( ) { }); }
[12:48:41] <pachet> saml^
[12:48:45] <wer0ckz> yes reed1
[12:49:00] <saml> so i should re-register. thanks
[12:49:22] <pachet> re-register?
[12:49:27] <pachet> oh, well
[12:49:30] <pachet> just find what you want
[12:49:41] <reed1> wer0ckz: I see. No because the overlay is over it. You might want to use .clone()
[12:49:43] <pachet> if that means finding the elements to add listeners to before you append it to your container, do that
[12:49:55] <pachet> or just delegate the handler on the container itself, but that implies certain assumptions
[12:50:11] <wer0ckz> <reed1> wer0ckz: I see. No because the overlay is over it. You might want to use .clone() <-- which part should i use clone() ?
[12:50:45] <reed1> wer0ckz: Clone the whole section that you want Over the Overlay, and put the clone Over the Overlay
[12:52:46] <wer0ckz> im not sure how to do it :(
[12:52:57] <hlveheart> Say I have a modal that I'm using .load to load another page with a form within the modal. How can I force the modal to close after the form submits?
[12:53:39] <reed1> $('#idOfModal').modal('hide')
[12:53:49] <hlveheart> i need it to fire off AFTER the form submits though
[12:54:18] <reed1> $('submit_button').submit(function () { /* what I have up there */ })
[12:55:08] <hlveheart> wouldn't that stop the submit though?
[12:55:18] <hlveheart> or will it only fire after the submit completes?
[12:55:33] <reed1> It will fire right as the submit completes, won't stop it though
[12:55:44] <hlveheart> k.
[12:55:46] <hlveheart> thank you :)
[12:55:46] <reed1> It will only stop it if you do e.preventDefault or return false or something
[12:56:42] <reed1> If you need to make sure the submission was *successful* then you need to use $.post instead of submitting it at all, I believe
[13:00:50] <hlveheart> are you even able to submit a form after you .load it into a modal?
[13:00:59] <hlveheart> it seems to just refresh the page.
[13:00:59] <hlveheart> lol
[13:03:22] <henn1nk> hello! is there a way to reload the parent of an iframe?
[13:04:48] <hlveheart> henn1nk: parent.location.href=parent.location.href ?
[13:09:43] <hlveheart> anybodys? are you even able to submit a form after you .load it into a modal? it seems to just refresh the page.
[13:10:14] <henn1nk> hlveheart: doenst work :*
[13:10:15] <henn1nk> :(
[13:10:40] <hlveheart> henn1nk: parent.location.reload() ?
[13:11:52] <ko2in> henn1nk: $('#formID').submit();
[13:12:27] <hlveheart> ko2in, that's for me right?
[13:12:29] <hlveheart> :P
[13:12:55] <ko2in> ah yeah, sorry ..
[13:13:52] <ko2in> hlvehear: you could also prevent form's default behavior, so the page will not reload when the form submit
[13:14:39] <Sengoku> Hey, how would I count all the li elements that belong to the #page element?
[13:14:51] <reed1> $('#page li').length
[13:15:51] <hlveheart> ko2in, i'm going to try the .submit option but... how would one go about changing the default behavior
[13:16:30] <Sengoku> reed1: ah, can i select based on class?
[13:17:04] <reed1> Sengoku: Of course. Why don't you jsfiddle.net your question
[13:19:17] <Sengoku> reed1: teach me your ways
[13:19:33] <reed1> Sengoku: Way #1: jsfiddle.net
[13:19:41] <Sengoku> Where can I find documentation on jquery querying methods
[13:20:53] <reed1> Sengoku:  http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:21:23] <reed1> Sengoku: That's not a great learning place thoughâ€¦ little too detailed
[13:21:27] <ko2in> hlveheart: just bind your form for submit event, $('#formID').bind('submit', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); // further process here})
[13:23:01] <reed1> Sengoku: I think this is more where you're at: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/

[13:33:08] <fission6> is there a go to plugin to achieve scroll to dom effect
[13:33:23] <reed1> scrollTo()

[13:34:28] <Sengoku> reed1: that's cool!
[13:34:29] <Sengoku> thanks
[13:34:41] <BillCriswell> The plugin isn't really necessary.
[13:35:04] <Sengoku> Now where's a fun one.. If I'm using the a multi-select widget and I want to add a search..
[13:35:16] <Sengoku> where would I start
[13:35:49] <madprops> how deep does children go?
[13:35:50] <reed1> Do you have any piece of that already built, Sengoku?
[13:36:01] <reed1> madprops:  only one level, .find() goes all the way
[13:36:13] <madprops> ok ty
[13:36:35] <Sengoku> reed1: I have the widget implemented- yes
[13:36:49] <reed1> Okay, and what does "add a search" mean?
[13:36:57] <Sengoku> reed1: Filter*

[13:37:38] <reed1> pong
[13:38:00] <EwokFartPorn> Ban. Bon.
[13:39:17] <BillCriswell> fission6: If you don't want to load a plugin you can use this: http://jsbin.com/uxamew/1/edit
[13:39:17] <reed1> Sengoku: Ah, that's pretty complex. You'll probably want to .keyup() an input box, and then use .each() to hide everything which is filtered out
[13:39:33] <BillCriswell> Just click "Run with JS"
[13:40:36] <Sengoku> makes sense!
[13:40:40] <Sengoku> i'll take a stab at it
[13:41:06] <reed1> Sengoku: Cool, there are also plugins which do it for you, but good luck!
[13:44:22] <consumerism> anyone know a javascript library that gives bootstrap tabs a url - so if i click a tab the url in my browser changes to reflect that, and i can send somebody that url and the same tab will open?
[13:46:20] <fikst> consumerism, you can use pushState for that
[13:54:11] <madprops> some quantum shit is going on. Things work as long as I don't observe them on the element inspector.
[13:54:29] <reed1> loool

[13:56:33] <Zapy> reed1 you there mate?
[13:57:08] <reed1> Zapy: Ya wassup
[13:58:06] <Zapy> i rewrote the hide/unhide thing to be dynamic, now im trying the refresh-button but i kinda stuck on how to build that
[13:58:37] <Zapy> data-url="" does that need to be used in a a href or could i use it in a <div data-..?
[13:59:22] <reed1> I think the answer to your question is yes.
[14:00:03] <reed1> More details please :)
[14:00:17] <Zapy> then im stuck on the actuall jquery script :P
[14:00:30] <Zapy> how to catch the data-url and use it
[14:00:46] <reed1> oooh okay, and what are you using it for?
[14:00:49] <Zapy> you have any page about that?
[14:01:10] <Zapy> www.warzone.nu:8080 that the refresh button on the right of Servers
[14:01:17] <reed1> Oh i remember now
[14:01:34] <Zapy> =)
[14:02:07] <Zapy> i use class for the hide now, so i can define the same function on other divs as well \o/
[14:03:09] <reed1> You can do var url = $('div.someClass').data('url'), and then $().load(url)
[14:05:38] <Pavlov> anyone know anything about jquery-mobile-iscroll?  not having much luck getting it to actually work
[14:15:17] <Pavlov> looks like the pagecreate thing isn't being called
[14:15:58] <Sengoku> if I have <div id="foo"><label>bar</label></div>
[14:16:09] <Sengoku> how would I insert an element after the label?
[14:16:44] <Sengoku> $('foo label').append('moo');
[14:17:02] <reed1> $('div#foo').append('moo')
[14:19:31] <Sengoku> no dice..
[14:20:20] <reed1> Huhâ€¦ jsfiddle it! :)
[14:22:04] <Sengoku> do i have to include the jquery libs?
[14:22:24] <reed1> On the left panel you can auto-include them
[14:25:17] <Pavlov> whats the best way to disable jquery mobile auto-initialization with requirejs? or to get pageinit/mobileinit events for the first page?
[14:27:32] <BillCriswell> Sengoku: $('label').after() or $('.foo').append()
[14:32:39] <djshotglass> how do you select checked inputs
[14:32:56] <reed1> $(":checked")
[14:44:25] <Zapy> reed1
[14:44:30] <Zapy> i fixed it
[14:44:35] <reed1> yay!
[14:44:42] <Zapy> www.warzone.nu:8080
[14:44:45] <d0100> hurray!
[14:45:09] <Zapy> but now i see i have the same problem with the hide thingy on the server-list because its jquery loaded
[14:45:26] <Zapy> i tried writing in with .on instead but then it dosnt work at all
[14:45:27] <Zapy> :)
[14:48:41] <reed1> Zapy: Ah you're almost there! You just need to reapply the click handlers, so â€¦load(url, function () { /* Reapply the click handlers in here */ })
[14:51:04] <rmill> Zapy, reed1: Or, use a delegated .on()
[14:52:03] <reed1> rmill: Yes, that would be better
[14:52:34] <rmill> That way you can avoid reapplying.
[14:53:28] <Zapy> ok, ill look in to it, but i want to get reed1 first, by repplying click handlers you mean " $('#servers').on('click', '.refresh', function() {}); ?
[14:53:57] <rmill> That's actually an example of a deleted .on()
[14:54:03] <rmill> *delegated
[14:55:12] <rmill> Zapy: Want me to create an example?
[14:55:19] <djshotglass> $("input[type=checkbox]:checked")
[14:55:22] <djshotglass> oops
[14:55:33] <Zapy> rmill yes plz
[14:55:43] <Zapy> or no
[14:55:46] <djshotglass> $("input[name=usernames]:checked")
[14:55:49] <reed1> rmill: Zapy's using that one correctly
[14:55:50] <djshotglass> is that ok
[14:56:03] <djshotglass> or is it $("input:checked[name=usernames]")
[14:56:57] <reed1> Zapy: $('#test').on('click', '.hide', function() {})
[14:56:57] <Zapy> ok rmill do it, cant get it to work
[14:57:12] <rmill> Zapy: Do you already have a fiddle?
[14:57:13] <reed1> Zapy: That's from your site Zapy, I don't think it should be "$('#test')
[14:57:32] <Zapy> no it shouldnt
[14:57:39] <Zapy> that was me testing
[14:58:00] <Zapy> hmm
[14:58:46] <reed1> rmill: I think Zapy's on the right path, properly using delegation
[14:59:20] <reed1> rmill: http://www.warzone.nu:8080/ is the site, all the JS is in the <head>
[14:59:20] <rmill> yea
[14:59:22] <rmill> Looks like.
[14:59:35] <Zapy> but delegate has the same structure as on so i should just change on to delegate (which i have done) but still not working
[14:59:43] <Pavlov> hrmp
[15:02:30] <rmill> Zapy: The syntax you have is correct.
[15:02:39] <rmill> check out this example: http://jsfiddle.net/vV7u4/
[15:02:56] <rmill> Notice how the event still fires even on the newly added dom elememts?
[15:03:15] <Zapy> just moved the jquery functions to a own .js file instead, i feel that it might grow a little :o
[15:03:28] <Zapy> ill look
[15:05:35] <reed1> Zapy: always a good idea
[15:05:44] <reed1> separating your source files
[15:05:53] <Zapy> yeah
[15:05:56] <Zapy> felt it was time
[15:05:57] <Zapy> :P
[15:21:09] <Zapy> reed1
[15:21:12] <Zapy> http://warzone.nu:8080/
[15:21:19] <Zapy> 	$('.hide').on('click', function() {
[15:21:19] <Zapy> 	$('.hide').parent('div').next('p').remove();
[15:21:20] <Zapy> workt
[15:21:24] <Zapy> but not toggle
[15:21:34] <Zapy> or well it removed everything tought
[15:21:35] <Zapy> hmm
[15:21:49] <webstormer> don't paste in the channel
[15:22:17] <shoky> Zapy: didnt look at the link, but i'm guessing you want $(this).parent...
[15:22:27] <Zapy> yeah that i figured right after
[15:22:44] <Zapy> but still dosnt work on that div i load with jquery
[15:23:36] <shoky> you're not using event delegation
[15:23:57] <shoky> like you're doing for .refresh
[15:24:35] <Zapy> you mean 'click','.hide' ?
[15:24:37] <reed1> Zapy: Yes, go back to what you had before, you were very close
[15:24:53] <shoky> $('#servers').on('click', '.hide', function..)
[15:24:55] <Zitter> which event I have to use in $.ajax when loading something? I'm trying with sleep(5) and beforeSend: function(data){console.log("I'm sending...");} but it doesn't work
[15:25:08] <shoky> or not #servers, sorry
[15:25:13] <Zitter> sleep(5) is on server, of course
[15:25:23] <Zapy> np, but thats what i have but it dosnt work shoky
[15:26:25] <shoky> Zapy: $('.col_right').on('click', '.hide', function..)
[15:27:07] <Zapy> no, it should hide the <p> and to do that i need this..parent div..next p
[15:27:27] <shoky> i didn't say not to get parent and p
[15:27:41] <shoky> why are you .remove()ing anyway
[15:27:41] <webstormer> is there any reason why promises wouldn't work in IE7 standards mode?
[15:27:59] <Zapy> shoky remove was just a test
[15:28:19] <shoky> webstormer: should work
[15:28:41] <Zapy> http://warzone.nu:8080/java/jquery-functions.js shoky line 6 to 10
[15:29:01] <shoky> Zapy: $('.col_right').on('click', '.hide', function() { $(this).whatever().whatever(); });
[15:29:53] <Zapy> ok
[15:30:11] <Zapy> why did that work and not .hide shoky? and ty
[15:30:13] <shoky> why .delegate for this and .on for .refresh? they're doing the same thing
[15:30:19] <shoky> just use .on for both..
[15:30:48] <shoky> Zapy: because .col_right exists and not all the .hide's exist (on page load)
[15:30:55] <Zapy> cause rmill told me, so i tried
[15:31:06] <shoky> k
[15:31:11] <Zapy> that was why u should use delegate
[15:31:12] <webstormer> shoky: ok.. I load a few scripts and use a common namespace called spf. In one script it looks like none of the objects added to "spf"
[15:31:30] <Zapy> thats was why i should have used delegate shoky, but that dosnt work or?
[15:31:36] <webstormer> in IE9 standards it works, but not IE7/IE8
[15:31:49] <shoky> Zapy: .delegate is just a shortcut for .on, it doesn't matter
[15:32:57] <shoky> webstormer: make a demo on jsfiddle
[15:33:48] <Zapy> shoky ah ok
[15:33:56] <webstormer> shoky.. that would take a while, and might not even produce the same conditions
[15:34:10] <shoky> webstormer: oh well
[15:37:49] <benlieb> if I have the value "all" in a string, and I have an object my_object with method "handle_all", how can I call my_object.handle_all?
[15:38:05] <benlieb> basically looking for dynamic method call
[15:39:13] <shoky> benlieb: my_object['handle_' + str]()
[15:40:02] <benlieb> shoky: cool, thank you!
[15:40:16] <webstormer> shoky: if you're curious, this looks like what I'm experiencing: likehttp://stackoverflow.com/a/4607721
[15:42:13] <Zapy> shoky reed1 rmill thx for the help, g-night :)
[15:42:30] <reed1> night!
[15:42:36] <shoky> gn
[15:42:43] <rmill> GOOD MORN'
[16:02:33] <robedwards> Noob jquery question here, if I set my variable as: var comment = $(this).closest('.comment_properties'); How do i make the variable the object that i've just found and not the original $this
[16:03:34] <reed1> robedwards: comment should be whatever has class 'comment_properties'
[16:04:11] <Zitter> Is $(this) "altered" inside $.ajax() ?
[16:04:20] <robedwards> No
[16:04:30] <robedwards> reed1: I don't follow ?
[16:04:54] <reed1> robedwards: Can you restate your question?
[16:05:41] <Zitter> I have a $(this) that returns <a>context</a>... after that I have a $.ajax{[...] beforeSend:function(data){console.log($(this));} that returns an Object
[16:06:06] <robedwards> reed1: I can't simple set comment = $('.comment_properties'); as there are numerous, so it needs to relate the event
[16:06:34] <reed1> Right, what you had before looked correct
[16:07:03] <robedwards> so therefore i've used $this, but when I've made a new variable to find 'comment_properties', the variable is $(this).closest('.comment_properties'); and not the result of that
[16:07:32] <robedwards> I want the variable to be the result, not the this followed by the traverse
[16:07:45] <reed1> it should be the resultâ€¦ can you jsfiddle.net it?
[16:07:55] <Zitter> http://pastie.org/7909087
[16:07:58] <reed1> What you are doing looks to me to be the answer to your question.
[16:10:12] <reed1> Zitter: You can $.bind that function
[16:10:49] <Zitter> .bind("click"(function() like that?
[16:11:15] <reed1> naw
[16:11:25] <Zitter> naw? :)
[16:11:29] <sacho> TypeError: string is not a function.
[16:11:40] <reed1> Zitter: $.bind() will create a function which always has a particular "this" or context
[16:12:11] <reed1> Zitter: $.bind(objYouWantToBeThis || this, function () {â€¦.
[16:13:30] <robedwards> reed1: http://jsfiddle.net/kTBTY/
[16:14:40] <robedwards> the console.log there, outputs the .reply-btn to be the object
[16:14:49] <robedwards> instead of the .comment_properties
[16:16:14] <reed1> k one sec
[16:19:19] <shoky> Zitter: any function call can have a different 'this'
[16:19:44] <Zitter> so, $.ajax() too?
[16:19:46] <shoky> Zitter:  you can do..  var el = $(this); $.ajax(...);     use 'el' in the ajax callback
[16:20:00] <shoky> Zitter: yes, when your callback is called, 'this' will most likely have changed
[16:20:35] <Zitter> isn't there a "special word" that returns always the node?
[16:20:55] <reed1> robedwards: strange!
[16:21:08] <shoky> Zitter: why should there be a special "node" inside an ajax callback?
[16:21:10] <robedwards> ?
[16:21:49] <robedwards> it makes sense as that's what your setting the variable to be, the anchor which you then traverse onto. But I want to know how to set the variable to the result of that
[16:21:54] <Zitter> shoky, thanks. el = $(this); works great
[16:22:09] <shoky> Zitter: don't forget the 'var'
[16:22:09] <reed1> http://jsfiddle.net/kTBTY/5/
[16:22:21] <reed1> robedwards: I just cleaned up your fiddle, and it seems to be working fine for me
[16:22:48] <robedwards> where do you see the console on jsfiddle?
[16:22:56] <robedwards> oh in console
[16:22:56] <robedwards> lol
[16:22:58] <sacho> use your developer tools
[16:24:46] <reed1> robedwards: hehe i was surprised when it worked the first time as well
[16:26:07] <robedwards> that's weird, it's different on my production code... glad to know that is how it's supposed to work though, thanks
[16:26:31] <reed1> robedwards: What version of jQuery are you using for production?
[16:26:44] <reed1> I put 1.9.1 on the fiddle
[16:27:36] <robedwards> thanks, i've just spotted where it was going wrong, I was resetting the variable somewhere else
[16:27:40] <robedwards> thanks for the help
[16:27:48] <reed1> lol g'bye
[16:28:17] <Zitter> Can I use 'beforeSend' function to show spinner icon while ajax call loading?
[16:29:18] <shoky> Zitter: you can. you can also just put it before the $.ajax call
[16:29:40] <coldhead> do it the shoky way and be a cool guy
[16:29:42] <shoky> or after it
[16:29:52] <shoky> *an cool guy
[16:30:33] <Zitter> I have <a>click here</a>. on ajax calling I want it as <a>I'm sending...</a> and at complete I want it as <a>Item completed!</a>
[16:30:56] <Zitter> so, can I use beforeSend and complete functions for first and second?
[16:31:14] <coldhead> i'm not sure that's how grammar works, shoky
[16:31:31] <shoky> it does if it's cool
[16:31:32] <coldhead> adhere to my flawless grammar instead of shoky's and be a cool guy
[16:31:54] <relipse> anyone use momentjs, for some reason moment().utc(bugnote.date_created); is returning the same date no matter what the bugnote.date_created is??? (its 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS' format)
[16:33:10] <coldhead> Zitter: http://jsfiddle.net/8cfaW/
[16:33:14] <coldhead> no need for beforeSend
[16:34:07] <Zitter> coldhead, you're right.
[16:35:09] <shoky> relipse:  moment.utc(...)
[16:35:28] <relipse> moment(bug.date_created) worked
[16:35:29] <relipse> thanks
[16:37:50] <relipse> shoky: oooooooooh now i see
[16:37:53] <relipse> thanks
