[05:50:07] <caliel> Good Morning #jquery.
[05:51:30] <caliel> I am developing a web app. Here I check for some "configuration" stuff, and, if not respected, I add a <div data-rel="popup" ...>. Each time there is a popup, I need to open a modal, but I need the previous ajax form submit to complete before passing to the next.
[05:52:16] <caliel> something like: if ($('*[data-rel^="popup"]'.length) { $('*[data-rel^="popup"]).each(function() {}} )
[05:53:08] <caliel> but with this type of code, only the last modal opens. I "solved" using {% if %} {% else %} in twig, but I don't find this really elegant. Can you help me?
[05:55:12] <caliel> I hope I explained "well".
[06:02:35] <sixfingeredamish> Hi everyone
[06:03:53] <sixfingeredamish> I'm trying to change z-index of various elements upon hover. Code-wise, it is working, but I'm not getting the intended effect. Would anyone be able to help me debug?
[16:03:34] <nug700> For some reason I am unable to get the mouse drag or mouse up events to fire on the document; https://pastebin.com/CUwyTL6C
[16:04:36] <nug700> If i change it to "this.doc.on('mouseup', this.MouseUp);" it claims doc is undefined.
[16:04:55] <robertmaxrees> mind tossing out a fiddle?
[16:06:46] <nug700> can try, but when I tried it on fiddle i couldn't get anything to show
[16:06:59] <robertmaxrees> you mean like the appends?
[16:07:46] <nug700> https://jsfiddle.net/dxL5pzu7/
[16:09:24] <robertmaxrees> so first off
[16:09:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m3g46rht/1/
[16:09:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't think your appends are doing what you want them to do.
[16:10:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m3g46rht/3/ works
[16:11:22] <nug700> Appends show up fine on my browser.
[16:11:28] <nug700> oh, forgot the css
[16:11:37] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:12:48] <nug700> Added the css https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m3g46rht/3/
[16:13:00] <robertmaxrees> need to hit "save" and copy the new url.
[16:13:05] <nug700> one sec, didn't add it
[16:13:47] <nug700> https://jsfiddle.net/m18s0djk/
[16:13:53] <nug700> still doesn't look right, but ok
[16:14:00] <nug700> drag's still not working, though
[16:14:16] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to make elements draggable?
[16:14:42] <nug700> yes
[16:15:06] <nug700> Not the individual labels. the 'tst' div
[16:15:32] <nug700> MouseDown fires on the div, but mouse drag and up do not.
[16:16:00] <robertmaxrees> part of your problem is 'this' changed inside the mouseDown handler.
[16:16:02] <nug700> Those I'm trying to fire on the document
[16:16:27] <nug700> ah
[16:16:43] <robertmaxrees> jquery binds 'this' to the element that fired the event.
[16:17:00] <robertmaxrees> also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API
[16:19:11] <nug700> Thinking I can just bind the object as .data() then
[16:19:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:19:24] <robertmaxrees> you can use .bind(this) to get what you wnat.
[16:19:50] <thykka> ..or an arrow function, but I'd reserve those for very simple handlers
[16:19:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:29:07] <nug700> OK, so I'm doing the binds on the correct thing now: https://jsfiddle.net/m18s0djk/2/
[16:29:17] <nug700> however, mouse drag and up are still not firing.
[16:29:54] <nug700> I've also tried "obj.doc.on('mouseup', this.MouseUp);"
[16:30:54] <nug700> robertmaxrees: ^
[16:33:38] <nug700> at the very least, '"$(this).on(...);" should work, but isn't
[16:34:08] <nug700> oh, this.MouseDrag
[16:34:50] <nug700> works fine now, thanks for the help
[18:32:19] <hollab0y> is it possible to do swipe gestures using jquery?
[18:32:33] <hollab0y> or draggable items
[18:33:12] <taplar> jquery mobile has swipe events built into it
[18:33:58] <taplar> hasn't been updated in a while though, so if that's a concern, you may want to consider rolling your own
[18:34:10] <hollab0y> why hasnt it been updated?
[18:34:23] <taplar> https://blog.jquerymobile.com/
[18:47:19] <hollab0y> so jquery is dead?
[18:47:39] <taplar> no, just the mobile and ui projects are not actively maintained currently
[18:48:43] <taplar> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/graphs/commit-activity  jquery-core is actively developed
[19:50:45] <ekiro>  Hi everyone, I recently started experimenting with jquery and have a issue I cannot figure out. In this code: https://bpaste.net/show/9f0b2ad2f8a4 the above file-id (commented out) works, but the one inside the $.get is undefined when i attempt to get that data value. Any idea why?
[19:55:13] <shoky_> ekiro: sounds like a timing issue, you need to make sure to get it only after you have set it. if you set it inside the callback, you need to get it inside too
[20:44:58] <ekiro> when doing a jquery upload, is it possible to initiate a upload, then have the user add some additional details about the upload while uploading, and also pass that data once the upload is complete?
[20:45:06] <ekiro> in other words the same way youtube does things
