[00:00:04] <Cork> then it takes the string given for the selection and uses it to do $(document).on('click', selector)
[00:00:18] <Cork> so live is a broken syntax and that is why it was removed
[00:00:45] <Cork> :not(.overlay) will exclude those elements that has the class, instead of looking at the class attribute
[00:00:57] <Cork> and only excluding those that doesn't have the exact string "overlay"
[00:01:04] <lite_> ah
[00:01:23] <Cork> .overlay is a class selector and the browser has a hashtable for that
[00:01:37] <Cork> class= or class!= is an attribute selectir
[00:01:40] <Cork> *selector
[00:01:53] <Cork> so the browser has to loop the elements and check the actual attribute on it for it
[00:02:32] <Cork> so basically if you ever do [class(anything)] you are doing something wrong
[00:02:59] <lite_> okay
[00:03:07] <lite_> lets see how your approach does
[00:03:18] <Cork> note though that is only true for class and id
[00:03:31] <Cork> those are the only attributes that has a fast track you should be using

[01:31:47] <basza85> i have code: http://paste.ee/p/mkoFX
[01:32:16] <basza85> what i want is, when i click on then button, i want, that javascript send data (to $_POST array), and this data can be receive by the same script (t.php) and display in one of div

[01:34:23] <rved> hi guys, I'm have an ASP.net site.. the whole website is in a form.. i want to validate 2 fields - both with the class: PotatoTemperature - i have this http://paste2.org/a0EabNBJ
[01:34:29] <Cork> basza85: you have to send the new html back to the ajax call
[01:34:35] <rved> now when i hit submit… it only validates the first field
[01:34:36] <Cork> basza85: and then you have to insert it into the page
[01:35:03] <rved> console 'tester' is shown twice
[01:35:12] <rved> but the validation rule only applies once
[01:35:22] <rved> does anyone have an idea?
[01:35:43] <basza85> Cork: how can I do it?
[01:36:02] <Cork> basza85: i just told you how
[01:36:06] <basza85> I have to reload page (and add form action=t.php)?
[01:36:13] <Cork> you send the new html back from the php script
[01:36:21] <Cork> and then you insert it into the page you have
[01:39:08] <basza85> so i should swich url : 't.php' to url: receive.php in $.ajax and in receive.php some of code?
[01:39:30] <Cork> uh
[01:40:01] <Cork> the html you echo from the php script is sent back as a response to the ajax request

[01:45:46] <Cork> what?
[01:46:18] <Cork> basza85: sounds like you need to learn the basics of how database server script and client side scripting works
[01:47:36] <basza85> Cork - i aware of this, but i need do one thing, and have no time for reading now :/
[01:47:46] <basza85> thats why i asking
[01:47:59] <Cork> basza85: well your basically asking someone else to do it for you
[01:48:19] <Cork> cause your question doesn't stick together cause of the lack of overview to how things work
[01:56:27] <rved> anyone?

[03:33:31] <webchao> good day, i use jquery's .on method to bind events to callbacks. What exactly happens when i bind a callback to an event thats already bound?  for example, i would bind $(myElement).on("click", fooCallback); and at a later point i would $(myElement).on("click", barCallback); . Now, would the barCallback  simply replace the fooCallback, or would they somehow get executed both?
[03:34:54] <xec> webchao: you'd have two handlers triggering on click
[03:35:03] <webchao> xec: ooh i see, thanks
[03:35:11] <xec> webchao: (assuming none of them prevent propagation)
[03:35:14] <webchao> yeah
[03:35:22] <webchao> thats not what i expected, thanks!
[03:35:36] <webchao> i will unbind the callback first then
[03:35:48] <xec> yeah, you can use .off() for that

[03:55:38] <relix> hey, is there a way to make sure ajax requests are processed one after another, so that there are never two at the same time in progress?
[03:56:40] <aquatix> relix: i guess you can create some mutex?
[03:56:50] <aquatix> sounds a bit hacky though
[03:56:54] <relix> aquatix yeah, but I'm checking first if jquery has something standard
[03:57:01] <aquatix> good point
[03:57:12] <relix> aquatix I'll probably use a promise to solve this
[03:57:23] <relix> i.e. wrap all calls in a .then()
[03:57:25] <aquatix> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4185910/prevent-javascript-from-being-executed-twice
[03:57:30] <aquatix> isRunning
[03:57:53] <aquatix> i hope that covers your use case :)
[03:57:59] <relix> aquatix yeah but I need the call to eventually execute
[03:58:03] <aquatix> oh
[03:58:08] <aquatix> hm, some queue then
[03:58:12] <relix> i.e. if two ajax calls are made, the second one needs to wait for the first one
[03:58:13] <aquatix> meh, sounds hairy :)
[03:58:16] <aquatix> yeah
[03:58:28] <relix> it's to solve the problem where I need the security of CSRF tokens
[03:58:45] <steinarts> write some wrapper
[04:00:28] <aquatix> relix: if you use a mutex, can't you just block the second call until the mutex unblocks?
[04:00:39] <sasmit87> Hi all
[04:00:47] <nihan> hey
[04:00:53] <sasmit87> anybody used jquery validator
[04:00:57] <relix> aquatix yes, that's the plan
[04:01:12] <steinarts> is ordering important? then i dunno if mutex alone can solve it
[04:01:22] <aquatix> steinarts: yeah, was pondering about that
[04:01:30] <aquatix> i think you would need to write a queue tehn
[04:01:32] <aquatix> *then
[04:01:52] <relix> aquatix yes, I'll be using promises :)
[04:02:02] <aquatix> relix: oh right :)
[04:02:14] <aquatix> i'm not too familiar with that
[04:02:16] <relix> steinarts nope ordering is not important, since the requests are made at the same time, they can happen in any order
[04:02:32] <aquatix> well, there's never 'same time' ;)
[04:02:49] <relix> aquatix exactly, so the ordering is undefined here
[04:03:20] <relix> if ordering were important the calls would wait on each other already because of how I'd written the code then
[04:03:41] <relix> but this is two totally different parts of code that at some times fire around the same time
[04:03:59] <relix> I can't sync them on a high level so I need to do it on a lower level at the $.ajax
[04:04:15] <nihan> what is the most easy mvc framework in js/jquery?
[04:04:33] <sasmit87> Hey I am using jquery validator
[04:05:15] <sasmit87> my question is that on check of radio box one input field should validate
[04:05:52] <sasmit87> there are two radio box lets say A and B and one text field
[04:06:26] <sasmit87> if I check radio A then the text field range should be 1 to 10

[04:10:19] <steinarts> relix: i'd really like to see your implementation if you can get promise-queueing to work, im having some trouble seeing how it can =)
[04:12:27] <anli_> Can a <li> be in another depth than immediately after the <ol>?
[04:13:55] <steinarts> sasmit87: onchange-event on the radio, remove and re-apply rules... you're not asking us to do it FOR you, are you?
[04:14:12] <Cork> anli_: yes and no, it can be inside another li with an ul or ol in-between
[04:14:40] <Cork> anli_: the direct parent of an li HAS to be an ul or ol
[04:14:40] <anli_> I want to use <ol><table><tr><td><li>foobar</td><td><li>foobar 2 etc
[04:14:47] <anli_> ok
[04:14:52] <steinarts> why on earth do you want that ?
[04:15:01] <Cork> anli_: table can't be a parent of table
[04:15:05] <anli_> To get automatic numbering
[04:15:16] <Cork> anli_: the same is true the other way around ul and ol and only be a parent of li
[04:15:26] <Cork> *can only be
[04:15:26] <anli_> ok
[04:15:37] <steinarts> anli_: nice thought, but use some other means
[04:15:41] <Cork> <ol><li><table><tr><td><li>foobar</td><td></li> is valid though
[04:15:43] <anli_> yeah
[04:16:01] <steinarts> Cork: no 'tis not! missing a close on the first <li> :P
[04:16:10] <Cork> steinarts: funny
[04:16:49] <Cork> ugg... i missed the li in the table...
[04:16:55] <anli_> yeah :)
[04:16:58] <anli_> Easily done
[04:17:02] <Cork> so <ol><li><table><tr><td>foobar</td><td></li>

[04:18:14] <anli_> Why not? I want automatic numbering
[04:18:33] <Cork> anli_: ya, but the numbering would be for the entire table, not the rows

[04:45:22] <Silkz> guys i am in need of some help, i am trying to create a text annontation system where uses can select some text, make some notes, and for the annotation to be saved
[04:45:27] <Silkz> anyone know anything like this
[04:47:43] <seutje> Silkz: http://okfnlabs.org/annotator/ ?
[04:48:00] <Silkz> is good but the saving using the RESTFUL webservice is a pain
[04:49:17] <seutje> Silkz: it has a plugin system that allows you to easily override pretty much anything, it seems
[04:52:08] <Silkz> seutje, seems like i have too use python to do saving loads etc
[04:52:19] <Silkz> not sure if i can override that

[05:11:13] <Syrit> guys, is $("#myDiv").children().on("change", function(){}) the right way, to bind on change action to all the div childs ?
[05:18:52] <xec> Syrit: yes. are you sure that's what you want?
[05:19:07] <xec> just seems like an odd thing to do
[05:19:48] <Syrit> actually, i have a fieldset, that is set to _destroy True, i am using rails, so, if the user changed any field, i want the _destroy to be set to falce, that's why
[05:20:12] <Syrit> makes sense  xec ?
[05:20:57] <xec> Syrit: sure. maybe you want .find(":input").on("change",...) instead
[05:21:28] <xec> .children() would just select all immediate children, like "#myDiv > *"
[05:21:39] <Syrit> yes, that's what i want
[05:21:54] <Syrit> because each div, represents a model. thats why
[05:29:43] <ph88> Is there any shorter way to do this ?  i want to grab the element i just added        var test;   el.find('.main').append('<div id="sub"></div>');    test = el.find('.main .sub');
[05:33:04] <shoky> ph88: var test = $('<div id="sub"/>').appendTo( el.find('.main') );

[06:11:55] <yalex> Hello, I'm noticing that jquery that works in chrome is not working in firefox.  In firefox I can't seem the get values for css properties that are set in an external stylesheet
[06:12:13] <airdem> how do you get them?
[06:12:28] <Cork> airdem: what are you using?
[06:12:31] <yalex> using .css('marginLeft'
[06:12:34] <yalex> using .css('marginLeft');
[06:12:43] <airdem> yalex, margin-left
[06:12:48] <Cork> should work ust fine
[06:12:52] <Cork> (both of them)
[06:12:53] <yalex> I tried that too airdem
[06:13:00] <yalex> I keep on getting a value of 0px in firefox
[06:13:18] <Cork> yalex: and the element is added to the dom and not display: none?
[06:13:28] <airdem> Cork, what do you mean "using"? i am looking for one
[06:13:37] <yalex> yes thats correct Cork
[06:13:45] <Cork> airdem: wrong nick sorry
[06:13:45] <yalex> the script is designed to execute on resize
[06:13:52] <airdem> yalex, you should create a jsfiddle
[06:14:20] <yalex> thanks airdem will do
[06:14:51] <yalex> im relatively new to jQuery so certainly not professing any knowledge
[06:14:52] <Cork> yalex: http://jsfiddle.net/xkA8C/
[06:14:52] <gregf_> 8(. never seen anything working in chrome not working in ff cuz the users want everything to work only in ie and ie8 only :/
[06:14:53] <Cork> wfm
[06:15:01] <Cork> so you need to provide an example where it breaks
[06:15:25] <Cork> well i have
[06:15:37] <Cork> there are a few situations where the browser bugs
[06:15:50] <Cork> but it's normally the other way around (bugs in chrome)
[06:15:53] <airdem> "cuz the users want everything to work only in ie and ie8 only" blasphemy!!!!!!!
[06:15:54] <Cork> and yes it is rare
[06:16:15] <Cork> i suspect he means the client not the visitor :)
[06:16:42] <gregf_> well unfortunately in my case it ain't blasphemy. ie8 is holy to the users :/
[06:17:17] <Cork> well many sadly don't know about alternatives
[06:17:22] <Cork> they arn't even using ie
[06:17:26] <Cork> they are using "internet"
[06:17:46] <airdem> those are not considered "users" in my world
[06:17:53] <airdem> those are "the used" :)
[06:17:58] <yalex> thanks have entered the content into http://jsfiddle.net/xkA8C/
[06:18:20] <Cork> yalex: don't forget to hit update
[06:18:27] <seutje> I keep trying to explain to my dad why it hurts me to watch him use IE
[06:18:47] <seutje> even showed him how much cooler google maps looks in a proper gl capable browser
[06:18:49] <seutje> buit alas
[06:18:51] <Cork> heck the first thing i do is install an alternative browser :)
[06:18:52] <seutje> but*
[06:18:59] <seutje> I did that a couple times
[06:19:01] <yalex> thanks have done so Cork
[06:19:01] <airdem> yalex, works for me
[06:19:06] <seutje> fucker always manages to reset it to IE
[06:19:14] <vldx> seutje, what is he saying - why he uses it?
[06:19:14] <airdem> console log says 100px
[06:19:15] <Cork> yalex: and the link
[06:19:23] <airdem> <yalex> thanks have entered the content into http://jsfiddle.net/xkA8C/
[06:19:26] <seutje> oh he doesn't have an argument
[06:19:40] <vldx> just because it has the internet icon, maybe? :)
[06:19:43] <seutje> when I said he should use chrome he responded with "oh, but I already use iGoogle"
[06:19:49] <Cork> airdem: that is the one i created ya
[06:19:57] <yalex> So airdem  in firefox the text on the slider should be flush with the  text on the blue background when the resolution is above 768 pixels
[06:20:12] <airdem> Cork, sorry, my bad
[06:20:27] <Venko> Could someone please point me in the direction of a lightweight lightbox library that I can use for Vimeo embeds? I'd prefer one that's self-contained or includes very few external elements (e.g. images). The ones that I've looked at so far won't work for me.
[06:20:27] <airdem> yalex, you have to hit save and copy paste the new URL
[06:20:41] <yalex> apologies its at http://jsfiddle.net/xkA8C/1/ airdem
[06:21:28] <rix_> Venko: colorbox
[06:21:37] <yalex> it chrome it looks at should but in firefox its not picking up the margin values
[06:21:52] <Cork> yalex: you need to make a working example
[06:22:05] <yalex> I have Cork it works for me here
[06:22:06] <Cork> that one is throwing errors high and low
[06:22:35] <Cork> oh you add the full html page...
[06:23:11] <Cork> yalex: reduce the problem to just what's needed to see the error
[06:23:13] <Cork> not the full page
[06:23:21] <yalex> okay
[06:23:43] <Cork> (you will most likely find the cause your self as you do this)
[06:27:18] <airdem> Cork, are there domains that only work with www. ?
[06:27:41] <Cork> airdem: by definition that isn't a domain
[06:27:41] <airdem> or can we always leave it out and still reach the correct site?
[06:27:50] <Cork> that is a dns record on a domain
[06:27:58] <airdem> because i can remember that there were some website that did not work without www.
[06:28:21] <airdem> i see. so its smth like a subdomain?
[06:28:25] <Cork> that is about if the name server can provide root aliases
[06:28:28] <Cork> no
[06:28:42] <Cork> a sub domain is a namespace added below a domain
[06:29:07] <airdem> so its not safe t leave www. out
[06:29:09] <Cork> user@subdomain.domain.com
[06:29:12] <airdem> *to
[06:29:20] <Cork> airdem: it is, but it has little to do with the domain
[06:29:35] <airdem> alright, thank you
[06:29:50] <yalex> interestingly it only seems to happen with margins
[06:30:02] <yalex> chrome returns a value but firefox always says 0
[06:30:16] <Cork> yalex: well i used margin, and it worked
[06:30:46] <yalex> Could it be the version of jquery thats being enqueued?
[06:30:47] <airdem> yalex, show us code :)
[06:30:53] <Cork> not likely
[06:30:54] <jnhghy> I have a php script that at some point (click on an element) loads a jquery-ui dialog, everything loads correctly and the dialgo is on the correct place, in the center of the page, the issue is that the main page(background) scrolls to the top leaving the dialog beneath the screen any idea why and how I can correct this?
[06:31:29] <yalex> trying to condense it down airdem its a wordpress site so there's a lot of other stuff it loads
[06:31:51] <j3lte> have an example jnhghy?
[06:38:12] <jnhghy> j3lte: I scroll down to an element near the bottom of the page (so I have to scroll the page all the way down), after I hit that element this is what happens: http://imagebin.org/273724 then if I manually scroll on the bottom here it's how the page looks: http://imagebin.org/273725  => so everything seems to be working fine just the background scrolling not ok
[06:41:03] <TeraJL> is there any event on jquery that it's thrown on the creation of an element? i have a heavy function, that need's to run for each element of a class... for now it's checking all elements with that class evrytime, and my idea is to, when jquery creates and element with that class it gets added to an array, so it doesn't need to check all of them all the time
[06:41:42] <FiLeVeR10> anyone using newest jquery with cycle 2?
[06:42:05] <Cork> TeraJL: no
[06:42:36] <Cork> TeraJL: there are some new experimental objects you can use to monitor changes in the dom
[06:42:45] <Cork> TeraJL: but they aren't cross browser yet
[06:42:51] <Cork> ?mdn mutationobservers
[06:42:51] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[06:42:59] <TeraJL> ok :/, and thanks
[06:46:15] <Cork> hmm
[06:46:23] <Cork> actually they ARE cross browsers now...
[06:46:26] <Cork> NICE
[06:46:36] <Cork> though you will have a min version of ie11 >_>
[06:48:58] <yalex> It wouldn't be because the margin is set to auto?
[06:49:15] <yalex> chrome is converting to a value and firefox is reading as blank
[06:49:22] <Cork> that would be one possible reason yes
[06:49:31] <airdem> why cant you just copy the portion of html/css/js into jsfiddle?
[06:50:02] <yalex> okay so how do I get the actual margin value? I could get the length of the text and then substract the overall width
[06:50:52] <lasha> jQuery has .width() and .outerWidth()
[06:50:52] <lasha> ;)
[06:52:35] <Cork> yalex: well the correct value to get would be "auto"
[06:52:58] <yalex> yeh thats just dawned on me Cork
[06:56:10] <Cork> yalex: for margin auto you normally need to take the width of the parent and remove the width of the target
[06:56:28] <Cork> that should give you the value you want (possibly divide by 2)
[06:56:40] <yalex> thanks Cork thats what I'm working on now
[06:57:16] <Cork> var self = $(this); self.parent().width() - self.width()
[06:57:33] <Cork> or actually
[06:57:41] <Cork> var self = $(this); self.parent().width() - self.outerWidth()
[06:57:55] <Cork> if you want to include the border of the target
[07:01:08] <yalex> THanks that's fixed Cork - guess it makes sense .css picks up the css value from the stylesheet - if its auto then it there doesn't have a numerical value
[07:01:34] <Cork> yalex: well there is
[07:01:41] <Cork> but margin: auto is complex
[07:01:47] <yellowfish> Anyone have experiences with Chromebooks?
[07:01:55] <Cork> and it might change very rapidly
[07:02:10] <Cork> yellowfish: offtopic
[07:02:26] <Cork> unless it is about automating it with jquery
[07:02:26] <yalex> Is there a way to execute the next line in jquery after a css transition has completed?
[07:02:40] <Cork> yalex: yes
[07:02:50] <yalex> Tell me more Cork?
[07:02:56] <Cork> you bind and event for transitionend (it has a lot of names though)
[07:03:19] <Cork> sadly there is -webkit-transition-end -o-transitionEnd -o-transition-end and so on
[07:03:27] <Cork> ?mdn transitionend
[07:03:28] <b-ot> Cork: transitionend - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/transitionend
[07:03:38] <Cork> (check the compatibility chart at the bottom)
[07:04:07] <Cork> opps its webkitTransitionEnd not -webkit-
[07:04:09] <yalex> That being said I'm probably getting over the top - how many people really resize their browser window continually while seeing a website. It does the job for rotation on mobiles and scales to different resolutions
[07:04:36] <yalex> Even IE seems to support the standards these days
[07:05:10] <Cork> yalex: you can often archive that through css
[07:05:22] <Cork> if nothing else through the @media query
[07:06:00] <yalex> Yeah there's multiple @media  queries but I specially wanted an element to anchor to the bottom of the current visible window and remain fixed in place
[07:06:16] <Cork> yalex: position: fixed?
[07:06:19] <Venko> rix_: Thank you. I just successfully did what I wanted via Colorbox :)
[07:06:26] <Cork> though ya many mobile browsers is broken with fixed :/
[07:06:56] <yalex> yeh so thought jquery would work and it does
[07:07:08] <yalex> nothing like a crash course in something
[07:07:35] <Cork> yalex: though you could do it for those browsers and use fixed for the rest :)
[07:07:55] <Cork> as mobile doesn't really have resize it shouldn't be much of a problem
[07:10:03] <yalex> Or people should just go back to using a computer for real browsing!
[07:16:55] <yalex> Thanks for the jquery insights Cork and airdem
[07:17:11] <Cork> np
[07:17:17] <airdem> yalex, happy to help, although i did nothing :)
[07:17:29] <yalex> sometimes just talking through these things helps
[07:27:59] <airdem> how can i access an iframes content via jquery?
[07:28:22] <Cork> airdem: $('iframe').contains().find('target')
[07:28:33] <airdem> thank you
[07:28:33] <Cork> airdem: only works if the iframe is from the same domain as your main page
[07:29:24] <lasha> it's .contents()
[07:29:26] <rix_> Venko: np
[07:29:29] <lasha> not .contains() :)
[07:29:53] <Cork> opps
[07:30:40] <airdem> hehe was wondering why i kept getting an error. thanks lasha
[07:31:05] <lasha> sure then
[07:36:20] <Kneta> What does this one mean? "$('<li>', { text: formatItem(item) }).appendTo($('#products'));" . Im not sure how to search for this one in the API?
[07:36:48] <Cork> it's the same as $('<li>').text(formatItem(item)).appendTo('#products');
[07:37:03] <Cork> it creates an li adds the formatItem text to the new element
[07:37:09] <Cork> and appends it to #products
[07:37:15] <Kneta> does it add a </li> as well then?
[07:37:23] <Cork> it doens't generate html
[07:37:28] <Cork> it generates dom elements
[07:37:35] <Cork> so there is no <li></li>
[07:37:40] <Kneta> ah yeah
[07:37:46] <Kneta> thank you!
[07:37:54] <Cork> $('<li>')[0] is the exact save thing as document.createElement('li)
[07:38:03] <Cork> * $('<li>')[0] is the exact save thing as document.createElement('li')
[07:47:04] <Erneston> can anyone spot what am doing wrong here : $(document).ready(function(){  alert('shit'); });
[07:47:46] <Cork> Erneston: you're looking at the wrong place
[07:48:30] <Erneston> ?
[07:49:01] <Cork> the error is somewhere else
[07:49:25] <Erneston> very good
[07:49:26] <Erneston> :)
[07:49:33] <Erneston> i had removed the jquery file haha
[07:49:50] <Erneston> sanity saved , thx
[07:49:57] <Cork> :)
[07:50:11] <Erneston> does this happen alot while playing with test cases?
[07:50:32] <Cork> no can't say i lose the jquery lib a lot
[07:51:50] <Erneston> i had removed it stripping down the code and saved file and forgotten
[07:52:07] <Erneston> 27 windows open in browser
[07:52:14] <Erneston> which is pretty normal for me
[08:03:16] <FiLeVeR10> How do I disable compatibility mode in ie? I'm working on this locally, and everyone in the org has it enabled for intranet by default http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/eQvAX/
[08:03:20] <krambiorix> how can i add a <span></span> in a dialog button on init?
[08:05:21] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix: just use .append('<span></span>')
[08:07:17] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix:  $( "#dialog" ).append('<span></span>').dialog( "open" );
[08:09:19] <FiLeVeR10> nm, got it. inserting <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" /> in head diables it
[08:09:47] <FiLeVeR10> feel free to use this slideshow if you want it, just need to change the css to fit your images. http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/eQvAX/
[08:10:08] <superdonkey> do you think there is an advantage in using mvc vs webforms with jquery?
[08:10:56] <FiLeVeR10> superdonkey: http://bit.ly/SUPiJ8
[08:11:57] <FiLeVeR10> superdonkey: using jquery with it isn't really the issue, or shouldn't be. it's the difference between mvc and webforms thats the issue
[08:12:24] <krambiorix> FiLeVeR10, i'm sorry , i forgot to mention something: i want to add <span>blabla</span> in a dialog button in the button pane
[08:13:14] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix:  $( "#dialog" ).append('<span>blabla</span>').dialog( "open" );
[08:13:38] <krambiorix> but that's not in the button
[08:14:16] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix: what's not in the button?
[08:14:29] <krambiorix> FiLeVeR10, the span
[08:15:04] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix: can u put it into a fiddle so I can see what you mean?
[08:16:01] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix: are you trying to put the button value into the span?
[08:16:37] <krambiorix> FiLeVeR10, no, the span IN the button
[08:16:58] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix:  button's aren't containers
[08:18:32] <krambiorix> ow ok, FiLeVeR10 thanks!
[08:19:08] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix: lol, np. did that help?
[08:21:18] <krambiorix> FiLeVeR10, nope, but i'll do it another way :D
[08:21:43] <CiE|Work> Hey guys i got a stupid question
[08:21:46] <krambiorix> FiLeVeR10, you helped me see that :D
[08:21:55] <CiE|Work> looked online and could't find a way to do it
[08:21:56] <FiLeVeR10> krambiorix: np, glad to help
[08:22:05] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: what up?
[08:22:05] <CiE|Work> $('.show#' + divID).show();
[08:22:32] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: $('.show #' + divID).show();
[08:22:34] <CiE|Work> i want to get anything with the class show and with the ID of the variable divID and show() it it is hidden
[08:22:42] <CiE|Work> really.
[08:22:43] <CiE|Work> lol
[08:22:45] <CiE|Work> let me see
[08:23:02] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: just needed a space between selectors
[08:23:37] <CiE|Work> FiLeVeR10 i just tried it not doing what i want
[08:23:43] <CiE|Work> should i paste some code?
[08:24:11] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: then you just need the id, which should only exist once on a page $('#'+divID).show();
[08:24:34] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: if you have more than one of the same ID it should be a class, ID is distinct
[08:24:45] <CiE|Work> FiLeVeR10 this is what i have http://paste.laravel.com/Z9w
[08:25:14] <CiE|Work> so i click on the test class and if i did alert it gives me the id and then i want the div with the show class and that id to show
[08:25:15] <kev999> hi - anyone know how to wait for jquery .load to complete before continuing JQUERY v1.8
[08:25:29] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: you need to change var divID = this.id; to var divID = this.attr('id');
[08:26:08] <CiE|Work> got this error from firebug
[08:26:10] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: then just the id should be all you need to select to show
[08:26:12] <CiE|Work> TypeError: this.attr is not a function
[08:26:13] <CiE|Work> var divID = this.attr('id');
[08:26:17] <nicetry> Hi, I am using bootstrap and have '.buttons-radio .btn-group' - to which I've added a .click() function.  The function checks which of the buttons is currently '.active'. However the .click event seems to fire BEFORE the bootstrap code changes the '.active' class from the old button to now-clicked-on button.  How can I have the function run AFTER the the active classes is altered to reflect the new state?
[08:26:33] <airdem> CiE|Work, $(this) not this
[08:26:54] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: use this then var divID = $(this).attr('id');
[08:27:12] <CiE|Work> still does not work...
[08:27:15] <CiE|Work> no error this time
[08:27:26] <kev999> try console.log
[08:27:28] <CiE|Work> the class show is on a <tr>
[08:27:39] <CiE|Work> <tr class='show' id='{{$appointment->app_id}}' style="display:none;">
[08:27:41] <CiE|Work> like that
[08:27:52] <CiE|Work> i'm not even sure if i can show or toggle that normally
[08:28:31] <airdem> CiE|Work, are you using the same id on two different elements?
[08:28:47] <kev999> <CiE|Work> instead of show() try setting CSS to 'display':'table-row'
[08:28:48] <CiE|Work> yes and thats the problem
[08:28:58] <airdem> CiE|Work, indeed
[08:29:01] <airdem> use classes
[08:29:21] <airdem> or different ids
[08:29:23] <kev999> $(this).css('display','table-row');
[08:29:29] <airdem> with a prefix
[08:29:49] <CiE|Work> kev999 would that work even when using the same id?
[08:30:06] <airdem> CiE|Work, you should NEVER use the same id twice
[08:30:15] <CiE|Work> i'll add prefix
[08:30:16] <kev999> sorry joined late - why same id?
[08:30:22] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: IDs are distinct, one per page
[08:30:40] <nezZario> hello
[08:30:51] <FiLeVeR10> nezZario: hola!
[08:31:03] <nezZario> just curious.. is there a way to short-hand syntax multiple event handlers ?
[08:31:24] <nezZario> say I had a .hover and .click .. nothing similar to $('#foo').click(...).hover(...) ?
[08:31:34] <kev999> Because you have a reference to $(this) - use CLASS instead of ID if there is more than one
[08:32:24] <kev999> CiE|Work - using a class name should work if you are using toggle
[08:32:40] <airdem> nezZario, yes there is on('hover click', function(){});
[08:32:47] <airdem> .on()
[08:33:38] <FiLeVeR10> nezZario: .on('click', function*(){...},'hover', function(){...})
[08:33:52] <nezZario> oh, beautiful
[08:34:10] <airdem> FiLeVeR10, didnt knew that one, thanks
[08:34:11] <FiLeVeR10> nezZario: sorry about the *, shouldn't be there
[08:34:54] <kev999> Anyone know how to wait for .load ajax call to complete before continue in JQUERY v1.8 ??
[08:35:06] <FiLeVeR10> what can I do to streamline all of these cycle 2 effects? http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/eQvAX/
[08:35:19] <kev999> async:false depreciated
[08:35:28] <CiE|Work> Guys tried it adding a prefix and it still does not work here is whole work
[08:35:28] <kev999> .done() doesn't wait
[08:35:33] <CiE|Work> http://paste.laravel.com/Z9N
[08:36:15] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: $('.show #T' + divID).show(); should be $('.show #' + divID).show();
[08:36:28] <FiLeVeR10> whoops, that was for CiE|Work
[08:36:44] <nezZario> this won't work though? (it's not working for me) $('#foo').on('hover', function() { alert('i hovered'); }, function() { alert('i unhovered'); }, 'click', function() { alert('i clicked'); });
[08:36:44] <nezZario> just trying to learn some new things :)
[08:37:13] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: attach a callback that changes a value when it's done to trigger continue
[08:38:16] <FiLeVeR10> nezZario: doesn't look like it will, you mouseover and mouseout instead of hover and it should
[08:38:25] <kev999> <FiLeVeR10> the .load is in a function and the function is returning before the response is recived. I'll post the example
[08:38:44] <nezZario> nice, nice
[08:38:53] <nezZario> really appreciate it
[08:39:03] <FiLeVeR10> nezZario: np
[08:39:28] <kev999> CiE|Work just looked at your paste change all your rows to the same class (show). and then ....
[08:39:43] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: then you need to include a trigger in the response that is needed before it returns
[08:40:30] <sunbeam> whats better to use ? element.on('click', function(e) {} or element.click(function() { }) ?
[08:40:45] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: or, make the return part of the response
[08:40:59] <FiLeVeR10> sunbeam: .on is the standard in newer jquery
[08:42:09] <CiE|Work> FiLeVeR10 i am adding a T as a prefix on line 26 of my paste to differentiate the ID's from the Class Test and the Class Show
[08:42:41] <sunbeam> FiLeVeR10: thanks
[08:42:44] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: right, but when you get the id it already has the 'T', so you're really printing two 'T's
[08:43:20] <kev999> FiLeVeR10 - going to check a few of your suggestions - will get back
[08:43:31] <CiE|Work> FiLeVeR10 in the class test which is the one that i want to click on to then show the class show row i am only putting the id without the prefix
[08:43:50] <CiE|Work> only in the class show on line 26 i am putting the prefix T
[08:44:27] <kev999> FiLeVeR10 while I'm away - think the solution to <CiE|Work> is to use one class all rows and then toggle against .not($(this))
[08:44:45] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: ah, i see what you did there. question, are the show's always directly after the tests?
[08:44:53] <CiE|Work> FiLeVeR10 yes
[08:45:14] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: then you're making this way harder than it should be
[08:45:18] <CiE|Work>  lol
[08:45:22] <CiE|Work> how can i do it?
[08:46:07] <FiLeVeR10> $('.test').on('click', function(){ $(this).next().show(); });
[08:47:14] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: then you don't even need the ids for it to work
[08:47:47] <CiE|Work> FiLeVeR10 your the man thanks i changed it to toggle
[08:48:05] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: np, glad it works, and that it'll be less code
[08:48:07] <CiE|Work> kev999 thanks for your help
[08:48:15] <CiE|Work> yep always love less lines
[08:49:35] <FiLeVeR10> CiE|Work: me too, remember you can use .children() and .siblings() to save lines too when selecting nearby things
[08:56:39] <Tomashe> hey guys , anyidea about this issue : any idea about that issue
[08:56:48] <Tomashe> it seems to output false from some weird reason
[08:59:44] <sacho> what issue?
[09:01:03] <Tomashe> its always say false
[09:01:11] <Tomashe> i insert "1" as my value and its not in the array
[09:01:19] <Tomashe> if its not inthe array it should output true
[09:02:39] <_christian> Hello. I is there a way to bind an event ( ie: click ) for two elements, but without using a selector. I have something like this → var foo = $( '<div />' ); var bar = $( '<div />' ); ... Now I want this → ( foo and bar ).click( function() { ... } );
[09:02:39] <NoiseEee> Tomashe: what?
[09:06:48] <sacho> _christian, use add.
[09:07:32] <JesseC> Anyone know what the difference is between the event mousedown and mousedown.dbg? I'm looking through a plugin using the event mousedown.dbg, but can't find anything on why he's using .dbg when searching
[09:08:02] <sacho> it's a custom event most likely fired by the plugin.
[09:08:05] <_christian> sacho: Ohh yes!! that's what I need. Thank you sacho!
[09:09:08] <JesseC> sacho: It's a one page plugin, I don't see anything creating the custom events per say.
[09:09:19] <JesseC> sacho: https://github.com/kentor/jquery-draggable-background/blob/master/draggable_background.js
[09:09:28] <jr3cpo> I'm returning a json object {error:"error text here"} when a error occurs how do I extract this error from $.ajax.error(data)? data.responseText.error?
[09:10:25] <JesseC> Ohh.. dbg = draggable background.. I still don't get why he's defining the events in that matter, what purpose does it serve.
[09:10:35] <JesseC> manner*
[09:10:43] <mentoc> I have a selector select[name='foobar'] but I have two forms that use those same names. Is there a way I can say select[name='foobar'] but also specify a class or another distinguishing attribute?
[09:11:23] <mentoc> can I do form1.select[name='foobar'] ??
[09:11:57] <JesseC> nm, I'm a tard. I remember reading about naming the events so you can turn them off specifically.
[09:11:58] <sacho> JesseC, http://api.jquery.com/on/ , check out the part about event namespaces
[09:12:20] <JesseC> sacho: thanks, I just remembered, ha. :)
[09:28:40] <Erneston> how can i make a page scroll down to a waypoint after 3 seconds?
[09:28:57] <Erneston> i have the timer setup and the waypoints, i just cant figure out the rest
[09:31:39] <FiLeVeR10> Erneston: .scrollTo()

[09:36:05] <morris4> hi everyone, still haven't figured out this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19236382/jquery-custom-event-via-object-not-triggered
[09:36:26] <morris4> Velveeta, sorry i had to leave last time. have you found anything?
[09:40:36] <FiLeVeR10> morris4: http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/s35bg/6/
[09:41:43] <FiLeVeR10> morris4: or this to save space http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/s35bg/7/
[09:44:28] <morris4> FiLeVeR10, that does not solve the problem. i want to catch the event using delegation. clearly it works with the direct binding
[09:45:30] <FiLeVeR10> morris4: ok, well you can't use document then, it would look like this http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/s35bg/8/
[09:47:44] <FiLeVeR10> morris4: when the document is created it's before the event is triggered, so you only get one response
[10:02:15] <FiLeVeR10> morris4: this work? http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/s35bg/39/
[10:02:50] <FiLeVeR10> morris4: using * as a selector is a little wierd, it will select html, body, etc as well
[10:03:09] <_christian> Hello. I have a variable with a text with special characters( ie: 'include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;' ). I want to show a substring( 0, 200 ). BUT there is a posibility that near of the character 200 there is an special char and it will show the '&' symbol there. Any idea ? thanks.
[10:04:38] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: use str..replace('&','')
[10:04:54] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: sorry, one . after str
[10:05:52] <_christian> fiLeVer10: After str & ? Do you mean I substr after the & ?
[10:06:02] <_christian> Sorry I don't understand
[10:06:30] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: so var value = "this & that"; value=value.replace('&,);
[10:06:47] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: so var value = "this & that"; value=value.replace('&','');
[10:07:07] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: the second, didn't finishing typing in the first
[10:07:10] <runeks> Is anyone familiar with the jquery-jsonp library?
[10:08:00] <_christian> FileVeR10: Oh yes!, but for example in the string 'include &lt; iostream .. ' if I replace the & there will be the "lt" anyways, right ? But it's a good option.
[10:08:53] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: var value = "this & that"; value=value.replace('&lt;','');
[10:09:15] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: you can also use regex with an array of things to remove
[10:10:56] <_christian> FiLeVeR10: ok, thanks! I will try to remove the special chars with regex!
[10:11:08] <runeks> _christian: "your string".replace(/&lt;/g, '<').replace(/&gt;/g, '>')
[10:11:56] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/xqB2z/embedded/result/  so, I have this problem with trying to make a more believable UI out of this, for tablets and am getting weirdness on my nexus 7 and am wondering about the usefulness of my attempt and whether I'm possibly doing something wrong. (further explanation is epanded on in the fiddle itself)
[10:12:09] <WebDragon> anyone available for a little responsive-design assistance ?
[10:12:17] <_christian> Yes runeks. But the problem is that I don't know what would be the string. It could have many special chars, &quote, &lt, &gt, etc.
[10:12:32] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: value.replace (/&#{0,1}[a-z0-9]+;/ig, ""); should remove all entities
[10:13:46] <FiLeVeR10> _christian: that will match anything starting with & or # and ending with ;
[10:14:08] <jop008> Is it possible to use jquery to extract all strings from the page . The strings must be stored in a database
[10:14:22] <jop008> maybe filter technique
[10:14:36] <dabear> jop008: sure
[10:14:39] <jop008> anyone used this techniqe?
[10:14:45] <_christian> good idea FiLeVeR10
[10:14:52] <_christian> I'll do it, thanks runeks too.
[10:14:52] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: you can gather the values and pass then with ajax to a php script that will put them into db
[10:15:15] <jop008> Yes I had that in mind also
[10:15:52] <jop008> Is there an example of the shelf function I could use?
[10:17:00] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: here's the doc http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ then you just make the php file connect and add to db
[10:17:13] <jop008> thx
[10:17:34] <_christian> ohh, what if I make this → escape( unescape( ' many special characters' ).substr( 0, 200) ); ?
[10:17:36] <jop008> Ajax I used many times
[10:17:39] <jop008> alreday
[10:18:13] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: oh, so you just need a php insert to db example
[10:19:05] <jop008> PHP is also already know
[10:19:23] <jop008> The jquery extract stuf is my main missing thing
[10:19:27] <Velveeta> jop008: define "extract all strings" ?
[10:19:46] <Velveeta> are you talking about the php extract function, or literally parsing every string in the document in the browser?
[10:19:52] <jop008> <div id=>Bla<./div
[10:19:56] <jop008> etract bla
[10:20:02] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: .html()
[10:20:07] <jop008> Select options translating and so on
[10:20:22] <Velveeta> jebus
[10:20:43] <Velveeta> do you need to maintain a relationship to what tags each string was stripped out of?
[10:20:44] <jop008> Maybe like this find all input label and divs
[10:20:53] <Velveeta> and do you only need bottom-level tags with no child tags of their own? details, man!
[10:21:00] <jop008> and p paragraphs
[10:21:11] <Velveeta> because otherwise you could just do $('body').text()
[10:21:45] <jop008> but then the page it self must be changed to call db for the strings as well
[10:22:30] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: $('label,div,p').each(function() { var value = $(this).html(); });
[10:23:05] <jop008> Will it be a 2 pass way first pass insert in the DB second parse change the page or use PHP to change the page?
[10:23:21] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: wait, are you trying to use javascript to change each elements language?
[10:23:39] <Velveeta> filever10: i think he's trying to use javascript to harvest the data he's gonna need to store for the default language
[10:23:41] <jop008> <div>Test</div> becomes something like <div id=></div>
[10:24:12] <jop008> no the DB holds the translate stuf
[10:24:41] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: so you wanna use ajax to change the language?
[10:24:47] <jop008> yes
[10:24:56] <Velveeta> oh yucky
[10:25:10] <jop008> Good approach?
[10:25:26] <Velveeta> no, language support is typically handled from the server side at load time
[10:25:33] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: well that's easier, and you don't need jquery to do it. just pass a language param in php, and update the whole content area with ajax
[10:25:47] <Velveeta> the amount of dom manipulation you're talking about to just change it on the fly would be pretty cumbersome to the browser
[10:26:01] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: agreed
[10:26:15] <jop008> whole content area?
[10:26:38] <jop008> THe page is not stored in the DBase
[10:27:00] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: if the page is generated with php, basically use ajax to submit a dif language and regenerate the whole page
[10:27:44] <jop008> We are not in sync I gues
[10:28:17] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: is the page initially generated from the db using php?
[10:28:18] <jop008> I don't understand your approach
[10:28:22] <Velveeta> i would just make a form w/ a single select element and an autosubmit with a get method, so when you change languages, it just passes the language name/id in the url, and let the server load all the strings and push them out on page load
[10:28:57] <jop008> No I have pages with some DB elements on it but the <div labels and paragraphs are now hard coded on the html pages
[10:28:59] <Velveeta> you don't need on-the-fly page transformation for language, because it's typically the kind of thing that gets set once, and left alone
[10:29:24] <jop008> Some data is pulled by Ajax based on sql queries
[10:29:26] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: that's what i mean, but if you add ajax, the page doesn't refresh, just updates content
[10:30:09] <Velveeta> filever10: yeah, i think we're both advocating the same solution in different ways, and both involve letting the server compile the full markup.. mine's just at load time, whereas yours requests the full markup and just swaps it all out at once
[10:30:25] <Velveeta> instead of piecemeal searching for individual divs and p's and spans and swapping out individual words and phrases all over the place
[10:30:27] <jop008> that's what I mean what is that
[10:30:28] <jop008> 
[10:30:40] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: indeed
[10:30:53] <jop008> How is your content then?
[10:31:39] <Velveeta> jop008: what you're proposing, a method of scraping your document to find all words and phrases and sending them to php for storage in the db, is really only good for the initial harvesting of those words and phrases, to save you the legwork of having to do it manually in your view files
[10:31:43] <jop008> I now have <div>Tekst</div>
[10:31:55] <Velveeta> it's not a good solution for transforming the document's language at runtime
[10:32:11] <jop008> Yes that I agree and is in my approach
[10:32:14] <Velveeta> you're gonna want to implement some kind of server-side template that accounts for variable-language content as part of its rendering
[10:32:30] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: ^he's got it
[10:32:32] <Velveeta> so like <div>[GREETING_TEXT]</div> etc
[10:32:33] <WebDragon> dang, it's just like I never said anything
[10:32:36] <jop008> But how the page must changed to reflect the DB items
[10:32:51] <jop008> Must the whole page be generated by PHP?
[10:33:12] <Velveeta> webdragon: if nobody answered your question, that means that they were either busy with someone else, or else they didn't feel qualified to answer your question
[10:33:12] <FiLeVeR10> jop008: if you want to re-render it with a dif language
[10:33:16] <Velveeta> i fall into the latter half
[10:33:24] <FiLeVeR10> what up WebDragon?
[10:33:42] <Velveeta> filever10: he's looking for some responsive input/help
[10:33:56] <WebDragon> Velveeta: there's another possibility: there was so much other ongoing chatter that no one paid attention to my two line interjection because it wasn;t answering anything going on at the time =)
[10:33:58] <jop008> So <div>[GREETING_TEXT]</div> etc where is this stored this div?
[10:34:34] <FiLeVeR10> WebDragon: you using a bootstrap, or making ur own responsiveness?
[10:34:35] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/xqB2z/embedded/result/
[10:34:52] <WebDragon> everything explained in the fiddle (easier than typing it out here :)
[10:35:04] <Velveeta> webdragon: i suppose that's true also
[10:35:28] <FiLeVeR10> WebDragon: so you want to stop zooming on android?
[10:35:38] <Velveeta> jop008: in your database, you'd have something like a content table, with a language_id field, key, and value
[10:35:54] <WebDragon> either that, or just overall am wondering if I'm fantastically DoingItWrong™ somehow
[10:36:03] <Velveeta> and you'd look like e.g. language_id 2, which might be german, for the key GREETING_TEXT, and pull its value
[10:36:18] <Velveeta> and then you'd swap that into your template wherever it sees the key [GREETING_TEXT]
[10:36:21] <jop008> That I understand so my static html page becomes like this <div>[GREETING_TEXT]</div> etc
[10:36:27] <Velveeta> right
[10:36:34] <WebDragon> android has no real need to zoom the inputbox -- it's perfectly visible and at an appropriate pointsize
[10:36:34] <FiLeVeR10> WebDragon: add this to <head>: <meta content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0' name='viewport' />
[10:37:03] <jop008> And with ajax calls I find the translation for greeting_text?
[10:37:16] <Velveeta> no, you find the translation at load time, from php
[10:37:35] <richcorbs> hello, is there any way to detect changes in "$('#element').data('somedata')"  ?
[10:37:42] <jop008> with <php tags on my page?
[10:37:51] <kev999> <WebDragon> I had a similar issue and overcame it with css
[10:38:01] <WebDragon> FiLeVeR10: jsfiddle goes "No need for the <HEAD> tag, it's already in the output."
[10:38:03] <WebDragon> bah
[10:38:04] <Velveeta> if you wanted to swap it out on the fly w/ an ajax request, you should call into a function that simply re-renders that same template in a different language and pushes out the entire new set of markup to your ajax request, which just deletes everything in body and reinjects the new content
[10:38:16] <WebDragon> kev999: oh ? which and using what css ?
[10:38:28] <FiLeVeR10> richcorbs: .change() what u need?
[10:38:29] <kev999> <WebDragon> I tagged the HTML with a class of 'mws' for example
[10:38:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: what up
[10:38:47] <FiLeVeR10> WebDragon: so copy it off of jsfiddle and test it with that in the head
[10:38:47] <Velveeta> richcorbs: not without dirty checking like angular does, or without creating an observable out of it like knockout does, and strictly using your observable mutation methods to alter the data
[10:38:51] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: nada lotta
[10:39:08] <kev999> <WebDragon> Then get the media file to trigger .mws #whatever at smaller screen sizes
[10:39:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: nafta keeping you hard at work with his fiddles :P
[10:39:28] <jop008> So the whole page is server based then
[10:39:44] <Velveeta> richcorbs: addy osmani recently did a presentation on a proposal for Object.observe(), which will make that kind of behavior native to the browser, and will be awesome once it's widely supported: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfOh-J-9BY0
[10:39:55] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: not yet today ;)
[10:40:00] <jop008> the complete structure of the page is pushed by PHP
[10:40:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:40:07] <richcorbs> Velveeta: thanks
[10:40:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: thats because im busy with him lol
[10:40:12] <jop008> <php tags like that
[10:40:30] <WebDragon> kev, yeah but this is a bit weird in that when the inputbox is given focus, it zooms in the display which counts as a resize event and triggers the js that handles resizes
[10:40:31] <kev999> So if you have #inputbox which is styled for desktop, you would have .mvs #inputbox on smaller devices
[10:40:45] <Velveeta> jop008: yes, that's what we've been saying for the last 15 minutes :D
[10:41:04] <kev999> just create a JQUERY toggle class to switch between icon and input and style accordingly
[10:41:10] <jop008> And I still don't get it completely that is communication
[10:41:25] <Velveeta> jop008: what aren't you getting at this point?
[10:41:52] <FiLeVeR10> WebDragon: how about something like $('#textfield').textinput({preventFocusZoom:true});
[10:41:57] <kev999> Then use <meta name="viewport" content="device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
[10:41:57] <jop008> why not like that <div><php ?><./div?
[10:42:10] <jop008> some php code to get the element
[10:42:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> jop008: its <?php ?>
[10:42:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that is a good idea i always do that with my code
[10:42:38] <WebDragon> hmmmm
[10:42:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> put php in the html
[10:42:45] <jop008> So within <div> here some php call </div>
[10:42:48] <Velveeta> jop008: yes, you could easily just do something like <div><?php echo GREETING_TEXT; ?></div> if you wanted to
[10:42:50] <jop008> like that I mean
[10:43:00] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: that's what i said, jsfiddle won't let him add to head, so i told him to copy it off and try it to see
[10:43:08] <WebDragon> right now, the meta viewport is only set to <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
[10:43:24] <jop008> than with a setting I can change language code
[10:43:35] <kev999> would wrapping the input in an overflow:hidden help?
[10:43:38] <Velveeta> what you're talking about at this point though is just the method of constructing the markup… i suggested a template, you're suggesting just straight up php injection of variables… both accomplish the same task, one is just more abstracted than the other
[10:44:04] <WebDragon> kev999: hmm no, doubtful
[10:44:28] <jop008> if you do echo Greeting_text where is the translation?
[10:44:41] <Velveeta> you pull the translation from the db
[10:44:45] <FiLeVeR10> WebDragon: jquery mobile has this that could help: $('#textfield').textinput({preventFocusZoom:true});
[10:45:09] <FiLeVeR10> WebDragon: but changing the meta in the head like me and kev999 said should fix it too
[10:45:24] <jop008> So where is GREETING_TEXT created?
[10:45:29] <WebDragon> ok let me give it a shot on the devel server
[10:45:30] * Velveeta facepalms.
[10:45:33] <WebDragon> back in a bit
[10:45:35] <FiLeVeR10> WebDragon: or, make it a different field that won't zoom when clicked
[10:45:45] * WebDragon passes Velveeta a fresh can of facepalm just in case
[10:45:52] <WebDragon> FiLeVeR10: heh
[10:46:07] <Velveeta> Velveeta: jop008: in your database, you'd have something like a content table, with a language_id field, key, and valueVelveeta: and then you'd swap that into your template wherever it sees the key [GREETING_TEXT]
[10:46:23] <Velveeta> stupid shift-enter doesn't work
[10:46:32] <Velveeta> i said all of this like 5 minutes ago, scroll back and reread it
[10:46:43] <jop008> swap that into your template?
[10:46:52] <kev999> <WebDragon><FiLeVeR10> Just thought - maybe use a div with content editable so that you can constrain proportions if that does not work and use jquery to update the input value in the background
[10:47:38] <jop008> So PHP holds a table and based on the table greeting text is set
[10:48:04] <jop008> DB => PHP array with strings
[10:48:04] <Velveeta> no… your database holds a table… php pulls the data from the database and passes it to your view for insertion
[10:48:10] <WebDragon> kev999: hmmmmmmmmm tricky :)
[10:48:16] <WebDragon> :w
[10:48:23] <WebDragon> whoops :D
[10:49:12] <kev999> <FiLeVeR10> any chance you could take a look at http://pastebin.com/3KaWcqyK
[10:49:23] <jop008> So php holds all strings in memory or everytime a DB call to get the languages?
[10:49:51] <kev999> it's that problem from earlier - having a mental block
[10:51:08] <Velveeta> php processes are killed whenever they're done executing a request… you could store your content table in memory via something like memcache, for faster lookup than from a db, but that's a whole other type of setup, typically, php would request those from the db per page load
[10:51:28] <jop008> why not >div>< php code dbvall(Greetings) <end php><//div>
[10:51:43] <Velveeta> what is dbvall() ?
[10:51:54] <jop008> db call to get string greetings
[10:52:11] <Velveeta> because now you're breaking up 1 db query into like 100, which slows things down a crapload
[10:52:30] <jop008> And how to make it one query?
[10:52:35] <Velveeta> you would typically use 1 db query to get all content keys for a given language, or for a given language/page combo
[10:52:43] <Velveeta> that's outside of the scope of this channel
[10:52:48] <jop008> okay
[10:52:53] <Velveeta> i'm not about to get into sql syntax in #jquery :D
[10:53:17] <jop008> So PHP holds an array for one language or one page language combination
[10:53:31] <Velveeta> that's how i would do something like that, yes
[10:53:46] <jop008> Finally I get it :-)
[10:53:54] <FiLeVeR10> ^awesome
[10:54:51] <jop008> But how to change the page to the new structure is this manually?
[10:55:01] <Velveeta> yep, it's called refactoring
[10:55:09] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: how can i simplify this jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/eQvAX/
[10:55:10] <Velveeta> welcome to the world of programming :D
[10:55:36] <Velveeta> filever10: oy ve :D just simplify in general?
[10:55:53] * Velveeta puts on a rubber cap and dives in.
[10:56:12] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: having a hard time adding before/after on cycle2
[10:56:16] <jop008> So now I have <div>Groet</div> which must <div><php array("Groet"]><end php></div>
[10:56:33] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: but i'm sure there's a much better way
[10:56:56] <Velveeta> filever10: let me see what i can do
[10:57:47] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: i just fixed the css so you can see the pager working
[10:57:48] <Velveeta> jop008: do yourself a favor and go download a shopping cart package called oscommerce… they have multi-language support already built in by default… you can take a look at their db schema and the php and view files to see how they implement it, so you can get an idea of a realistic implementation strategy
[10:58:51] <sayd> im trying to load angular.js in a $.getScript call.. i see the request succeed in my network tab (200) yet i dont get a success callback
[10:58:53] <Velveeta> filever10: i'm gonna start from version 17 :)
[10:59:08] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: it's using cycle2 with carousel, carousel changes the slides around to make it continuous, and changes some things that make things wierd in ie when you go to add to it
[10:59:17] <Velveeta> sayd: you were asking this last night also, right? something about using angular for lightbox preview?
[10:59:35] <sayd> Velveeta: yeh
[10:59:45] <sayd> sorry if i missed any answers
[10:59:57] <Velveeta> sayd: can i ask why you're wanting to load in something as bloated as angular just to use lightbox, instead of using lightbox directly?
[11:00:51] <kev999> Anyone able to help with http://pastebin.com/3KaWcqyK
[11:00:54] <Velveeta> filever10: so i'm not familiar w/ this carousel plugin, but i'll try to figure out what's going on here
[11:01:10] <Velveeta> kev999: oh yeah, i looked at this a few minutes ago, what's your question about it?
[11:01:21] <kev999> I'm trying to get some kind of synchronous .load to work jquery 1.8
[11:01:36] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/s35bg/42/
[11:01:58] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: using * in a jquery selector isn't going to help
[11:02:01] <sayd> Velveeta: sorry we have our own lightbox lib
[11:02:01] <Velveeta> kev999: so that it waits for that dialog to load and then continues your submit function?
[11:02:17] <sayd> and basically when a user loads the lb we will then load angular and the module
[11:02:38] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: sorry, wrong fiddle. that guy left
[11:02:41] <Erneston> hi again
[11:02:45] <Velveeta> sayd: and when does the user load the lib?
[11:02:50] <Erneston> sorry to bore people with parallax scrolling
[11:03:01] <Velveeta> erneston: you're still teaching yourself parallax? :D
[11:03:04] <sayd> our lightbox lib is always loaded
[11:03:06] <Erneston> lol
[11:03:08] <Erneston> trying
[11:03:12] <Erneston> moved onto scrollorama
[11:03:13] <kev999> <Velveeta> yes
[11:03:45] <kev999> <FiLeVeR10> I nearly did too after reading that !
[11:04:10] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: lol
[11:04:15] <sayd> Velveeta: i have a fiddle that loads angular with $.when ( $.getScript..) but its not working locally for some reason
[11:04:27] <Velveeta> kev999: there's some magic to be done w/ deferred objects here, i'm sure of it, i just have to figure out how :)
[11:04:42] <Velveeta> sayd: can you paste your fiddle again?
[11:04:50] <FiLeVeR10> sayd: what browser?
[11:04:51] <sayd> http://jsfiddle.net/Bah4K/
[11:04:58] <sayd> FiLeVeR10: Chrome
[11:05:17] <Velveeta> sayd: try changing then to done
[11:05:30] <sayd> so the fiddle logs
[11:05:33] <FiLeVeR10> sayd: if you run chrome with a --disable-web-security flag, does it still happen?
[11:05:50] <Velveeta> then actually creates a new deferred object with the intention of transforming the output of the initial when deferred objects
[11:06:05] <Velveeta> i don't know that it'll actually fix the problem, but that's step 1 to correcting that code :)
[11:06:13] <sayd> FiLeVeR10: i see the requests succee locally but its just never calling the then callback
[11:06:15] <sayd> i will try dont
[11:06:17] <sayd> *done
[11:06:30] <FiLeVeR10> sayd: chrome prevents loading external files on local pages by default
[11:06:55] <sayd> FiLeVeR10: its actualy loading from a local server so its not file:// url
[11:07:28] <jop008> But I don't have a shopping cart :-(
[11:07:29] <sayd> Velveeta: that didnt fix :(
[11:07:45] <FiLeVeR10> sayd: doesn't matter, i ran into the same issue using an xml file to make a tradeshow app
[11:07:47] <sayd> Velveeta: just testing getScript like this i never see the log: $.getScript('/js/libs/angular.js', function() { console.log('foo') })
[11:08:10] <jop008> I have worked with Drupal but no success not getting it stable so packages are not my thing
[11:08:26] <jop008> I have a small framework using Xataface
[11:10:07] <FiLeVeR10> sayd: http://joshuamcginnis.com/2011/02/28/how-to-disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome/
[11:10:31] <kev999> <sayd>  Do a network trace and get the http retun code against '/js/libs/angular.js' - does it get a good response ?
[11:10:32] <sayd> FiLeVeR10: it shouldnt be relevant but thanks! i am loading from the same domain
[11:10:44] <FiLeVeR10> sayd: that's the problem...
[11:10:45] <sayd> kev999: yeap its 200
[11:11:15] <Velveeta> filever10: quick question about yours, you say you're having a problem adding before/after on cycle2, but searching your js for cycle2 doesn't show anything
[11:11:39] <FiLeVeR10> sayd:  it prevents loading from same domain locally
[11:11:41] <sayd> FiLeVeR10: i think youre mistaken
[11:11:50] <sayd> Together, both of these flags will allow a developer to test cross-domain ajax requests from a local file.
[11:12:05] <sayd> im not using a local file or making cross domain requests
[11:12:14] <kev999> what does console.log of function( data, textStatus, jqxhr ) give ??
[11:12:26] <FiLeVeR10> sayd: then try it in firefox, see if it still happens
[11:12:49] <Velveeta> also, same domain policy shouldn't apply to jquery.getscript, it uses checks to see if you're loading from the same domain or not, and if not, it embeds an actual script tag to get around same domain policy, as opposed to trying to use an xhr request
[11:12:51] <Velveeta> oh!
[11:12:57] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: hunh?
[11:12:58] <Velveeta> well that might just be the answer :D
[11:13:24] <Velveeta> actually n/m "the answer"
[11:13:44] <Velveeta> filever10: hunh to which of my statements? the one about same domain policy, or the one about cycle2?
[11:14:05] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: both actually, lol
[11:14:43] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: not sure what would have cycle2 in my js, it uses cycle 2, still called with .cycle
[11:15:05] <Velveeta> filever10: jquery.getscript checks to see if you're requesting an asset from your current domain or an external one… if the current domain, it issues a standard xhr request for the script, and if it's from an external domain, it embeds a script tag with src="requested/file" to get around same domain policy
[11:15:42] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: so what was "the answer"?
[11:15:45] <Velveeta> filever10: ok, so i set a breakpoint in your before handler, and it triggered.. so are you having a problem getting it to trigger at all, or to trigger in certain instances, or am i missing something?
[11:16:08] <Velveeta> filever10: at first i thought that since it was embedding a script tag, maybe it's not returning an xhr object, which is what $.when would be expecting to receive
[11:16:30] <Velveeta> but my guess is that the xhr return behaves the same in each case, it just uses different logic to determine when to resolve it
[11:16:46] <sayd> Velveeta: does that apply to the fiddle i just posted?
[11:16:51] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: no, it all works and triggers. but i call the before and after in the progress section, instead of inside the .cycle. just wondering how to simplify
[11:17:19] <Velveeta> filever10: gotcha, let me take another look at it with that in mind
[11:17:40] <Velveeta> sayd: that does apply to the fiddle you posted, and on jsfiddle, it does trigger that console.log statement you have in your done function
[11:18:00] <Velveeta> i have a page loaded on my own localhost, let me try copy/pasting your $.when statement into it and see if i fail to get the expected behavior also
[11:20:14] <sayd> thanks man
[11:20:57] <Velveeta> sayd: it worked just fine on my end
[11:20:57] <visualshock> Can I host a webserver when I have no modem? (fiber)
[11:21:15] <Velveeta> i did get one exception thrown though
[11:21:25] <Velveeta> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method '$$minErr' of undefined angular-resource.js?_=1381861235585:8
[11:21:54] <Velveeta> kev999: gimme a few minutes to work on filever10's issue and then i'll be right onto yours :)
[11:22:14] <sayd> Velveeta:
[11:22:14] <sayd> i found the problem
[11:22:14] <sayd> [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module shareEmail due to:↵Error: [$injector:nomod] Module 'shareEmail' is not available!
[11:22:30] <sayd> i put a second function in the .then callback and discovered my error
[11:22:30] <Velveeta> ok good to hear :D
[11:23:49] <zzaichikk> -
[11:26:20] <FiLeVeR10> visualshock: yes, just install wamp or lamp depending on ur os
[11:26:42] <FiLeVeR10> visualshock: or just apache if that's all you need
[11:27:33] <visualshock> FiLeVeR10, ok thanks. But how do I open ports and stuff when I have no modem? I am not used to this fiber no modem thing.
[11:28:18] <FiLeVeR10> visualshock: oh, you want it accesible on the web?
[11:28:27] <visualshock> yes
[11:28:59] <FiLeVeR10> visualshock: you'll need to get a static ip from your isp so you can map the domain to it
[11:29:40] <kev999> or use dyndns
[11:30:27] <FiLeVeR10> kev999: thatd work
[11:30:47] <kev999> Be very careful when opening up your local webserver to the internet. You can easily be blacklisted if you don't configure it properly
[11:30:47] <FiLeVeR10> visualshock: this isn't the right place to ask, but you can find out more info here: http://lifehacker.com/124212/geek-to-live--how-to-set-up-a-personal-home-web-server
[11:31:17] <visualshock> thanks for your help guys
[11:31:24] <rmah> do geeks really need help with that?
[11:31:44] <FiLeVeR10> visualshock: np, make sure you protect it when you get it up so it dun get hacked
[11:32:49] <visualshock> FiLeVeR10, I will try ;)
[11:33:59] <dabar> Hello. I like to write verbose names for things, and so I want to have an event called "user_indicated_they_want_to_see_a_different_date_range"
[11:34:12] <dabar> So, $( document ).trigger( 'user_indicated_they_want_to_see_a_different_date_range' );
[11:34:29] <dabar> Anyone know if there is a limit to the length of the name for events?
[11:35:33] <FiLeVeR10> dabar: try it and see...
[11:35:51] <dabar> Would it be browser dependent?
[11:36:21] <FiLeVeR10> dabar: make one 3 time longer than you think you need and try it in all browsers
[11:36:38] <nafta_> hows everybody doing?
[11:36:48] <FiLeVeR10> nafta_: not bad, u?
[11:37:05] <nafta_> good good
[11:39:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> im doing fine nafta thanks for asking
[11:39:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[11:40:45] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: that's looking awesome, never though of putting it together that way
[11:40:58] <Velveeta> filever10: ok, so, i rearranged everything :D
[11:41:08] <Velveeta> using the beauty of jquery chaining
[11:41:13] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: did you get it working again?
[11:41:18] <Velveeta> yepyep
[11:41:31] <Velveeta> i wasn't sure if all you were looking for was how to reorganize it some, or if you wanted something on top of that
[11:41:50] <Velveeta> but you can do all of your event bindings before ever initializing it, and chain everything
[11:42:19] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: just wanted to see what i couldn't, only thing not working is the next/prev with you click the slides on the side
[11:42:20] <Velveeta> i also like to isolate different types of variables into different object namespaces, like i did when i put your $('#') references into a View object
[11:43:30] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: that's awesome
[11:46:02] <grafi> what
[11:46:03] <grafi> oô
[11:46:08] <grafi> hi Velveeta
[11:46:09] <grafi> :P
[11:46:19] <Velveeta> kev999: ok, let me jump into yours real quick
[11:47:16] <kev999>  <Velveeta> Thanks
[11:48:28] <kev999> <FiLeVeR10> where's your updated code?
[11:48:48] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/eQvAX/39/
[11:48:58] <Velveeta> kev999: that's the latest incarnation of filever10's code
[11:49:11] <kev999> thanks
[11:50:08] <kev999> <Velveeta> nice !
[11:50:57] <grafi> what are you doing? slider from scratch?
[11:50:58] <grafi> ^^
[11:52:06] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: that awesome man, thanks for the new perspective. I'll take that and run with it
[11:52:27] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: though click the left and right images, still don't fire prev/next
[11:52:29] <Velveeta> filever10: no problem, good luck getting prev/next fixed :)
[11:52:35] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: lol
[11:52:41] <Velveeta> yeah i know, i didn't modify any of the code, just reorganized it ;)
[11:52:52] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: yea, it was fun getting that to work to begin with
[11:55:26] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: got it working http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/eQvAX/41/
[11:55:45] <Velveeta> sweet :)
[11:55:47] <FiLeVeR10> there was a slideshow. that needed to be View.slideshow.
[11:59:06] <Velveeta> ahhhhh gotcha, i must've missed one :)
[12:00:56] <hcker2000> I have a bit of code that may or may not make an ajax call depending on which value is selected in my form
[12:01:19] <hcker2000> if the ajax call is made I need to wait tell it is done before moving on with my other code
[12:01:30] <hcker2000> any one know the best way to handle this ?
[12:03:33] <Deviad> Hello
[12:07:20] <Velveeta> ok kev999: here's a proof of concept, completely untested: http://jsfiddle.net/JF78B/
[12:08:46] <Velveeta> so to summarize that function, we wait for form submit, which would not pass locationId, so it would then call choose_location() and store the return, a deferred promise, into a variable and return false automatically… however, upon resolving that deferred (instantly if locationId is already set) it would retrigger form submit and pass the locationId as extra data, which would allow the form to submit
[12:09:40] <Velveeta> in the case of no locationId, it would return the unresolved deferred object, load the dialog, wait for the user to select something (or for an error, which would resolve regardless) and resolve the deferred with the current locationId, allowing the form to submit instantly once that was set
[12:12:51] <kev999> <Velveeta> Just back - I'll take a look - thanks
[12:14:40] <Velveeta> hcker2000: deferred objects
[12:15:26] <kev999> <Velveeta>  You and your deferred objects!
[12:15:42] <Velveeta> deferred objects are wonderful! :D
[12:16:29] <kev999> <Velveeta> Signing off for tonight - thanks for the code. Haven't tested it yet, but I get what you have done and it WILL work. Many thanks
[12:16:55] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[12:17:07] <kev999> quit
[12:21:01] <bberry> anyone here well versed with jquery UI
[12:28:00] <Velveeta> i am

[12:30:05] <Denommus> hi
[12:30:10] <Denommus> I'm having a weird problem in IE 10
[12:30:23] <Denommus> I have some textareas with placeholders
[12:31:01] <FiLeVeR10> hasClass on line 52 not working, any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/eQvAX/
[12:31:28] <Velveeta> filever10: remove the dot
[12:31:43] <Velveeta> denommus: and then?
[12:31:49] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: awesome
[12:32:15] <Velveeta> :)
[12:32:52] <FiLeVeR10> Velveeta: working great now http://fiddle.jshell.net/filever10/eQvAX/show/
[12:33:23] <Velveeta> nice
[12:37:00] <Velveeta> denommus: you didn't finish asking a question, but if this is your issue, here's a stackoverflow entry on something related to IE10 and textarea placeholders: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13764607/html5-placeholder-attribute-on-textarea-via-jquery-in-ie10
[12:44:55] <crash1hd> can anyone share a more simplified way of doing this? $(".so-checkbox input").click(function() {if($(this).is(':checked')) console.log('testing');});
[12:45:16] <crash1hd> or is it as simplified as it gets?
[12:46:01] <Velveeta> looks about as simplified as i can think of
[12:47:00] <crash1hd> ok thanks :)
[12:47:14] <krambiorix> in a dialog , how can i add a button  on the left side of the button pane ?
[12:47:46] <bberry> Velveeta: check this out. http://jsbin.com/egiGIBA/11/edit?html,css,output
[12:48:11] <bberry> all i want to do is have a scrollbar on the y axis when the box is overflowed with items
[12:48:38] <bberry> ive gotten it to sort of work with this http://jsbin.com/egiGIBA/8/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:49:33] <Davy_> hi, i got a page with a product and several foto's. When i hover over a thumbnail, it puts the thumbnail in the large view. When i hover the large view, it zooms in. They both work expect that it only zooms the first picture. When i hover over a thumb it shows it in large view but when i hover over the large view it shows the zoom of the first picture..
[12:49:41] <bberry> Velveeta: but then when you drag the item outside of its original container, it goes away (though not really because you can still put it in the other container
[12:50:48] <Velveeta> krambiorix: you'll have to override the dialog css to float that button left instead of right
[12:52:02] <stack> hello, I have a bug with jquery ui sortables, I have a div.sortable with inside many floatint elements, that forms many rows in the layout, when I move an item of a row >1 that elements disappears from under the mouse cursor and goes on the first line, what could be the cause?
[12:53:50] <Velveeta> bberry: i'm not sure what the problem is, you're trying to not make the item disappear from one list until it's dropped in the other?
[12:54:03] <bberry> Velveeta: yep
[12:54:51] <bberry> Velveeta: It doesnt disappear in the first link i linked you, but there is no scrollbar  :(
[12:55:11] <Velveeta> bberry: since those are sortables and not draggable/droppables, do you want the placeholder to stay in place even if the person is just moving the item to a new location in the same list?
[12:55:36] <Velveeta> bberry: you can add the scrollbar in your first example with just css, just put a .list-container { overflow-y: auto; }
[12:55:38] <krambiorix> Velveeta, thanks
[12:56:27] <Velveeta> davy_: can you make a jsfiddle example out of it, or show us where we can see the behavior live?
[12:56:35] <Velveeta> krambiorix: no problem :)
[12:56:57] <bberry> Velveeta: But if i do overflow-y:auto, the item disappears after its dragged
[12:57:20] <Velveeta> stack: same with you, can you make a jsfiddle example or show us where we can see it live?
[12:57:27] <maxmoore14> no doubt this has been asked & answered many times, but I can't find an authoritative post on it - anyone know the best way to changepage back in history with JQM?
[12:57:43] <Denommus> Velveeta: I'm sorry, I was talking with a coworker. Yes, that is exactly my problem
[12:58:08] <bberry> Velveeta: And im not sure about the answer to the placeholder question, i think i would like to keep the placeholder in place.
[12:58:52] <Velveeta> denommus: yeah, seems to be a known issue, you may just have to hack that workaround
[13:00:38] <bberry> Velveeta: Does that make sense?
[13:01:50] <Velveeta> bberry: yep, hold on a minute, on another issue for a minute
[13:03:42] <bberry> Velveeta: no problem, thanks :D
[13:05:57] <Davy_> Kudos to Velveeta, one awsome dude.
[13:06:18] <WebDragon> http://bbbsde.client-proof.com/events  ok folks.. I have a bit of a race-condition here with the search button toggle (size your width down to 600px so the search button toggle shows up)
[13:06:36] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[13:06:44] <WebDragon> if you click the button, the input field appears and gets focus. if you click away, the search button toggles off and the field disappears again, as it should
[13:07:08] <WebDragon> however if you click the search toggle again, the race condition happens, and the blur of the field toggles it off, before the click arrives to toggle it off
[13:07:20] <WebDragon> and it then toggles it back on again xD
[13:07:34] <stack> Velveeta: yes, I'm trying to reproduce the bug there :)
[13:07:54] <WebDragon> any suggestions as to the best way to avoid this?
[13:08:32] <Velveeta> stack: the bug where?
[13:08:34] <krambiorix> Velveeta, i float the button to the left but not it's on top of the buttonpane and not vertically in the middle
[13:08:59] <Velveeta> krambiorix: then you'll need to tinker w/ the css until you get it looking right
[13:09:01] <stack> Velveeta: on jsfiddle, and actually I'm not able to do that.
[13:09:08] <Lazuratus> Hello, I have 3 arrays, array1 contains strings A, array2 contains strings A, B, C, D & E and array3 contains string E. What's the proper/best way, to remove strings available in array1 & array3 from array2 (so it only contains B, C & D)?
[13:09:09] <stack> still trying.
[13:10:02] <Velveeta> webdragon: i'd have to see something like that to try to figure out what's going on
[13:10:18] <Velveeta> stack: but you didn't post a jsfiddle link, that's what i was asking for
[13:10:18] <WebDragon> Velveeta: try the url I linked. it's there
[13:10:34] <Velveeta> webdragon: your request is in line :D i'm back on bberry's right now
[13:10:43] <WebDragon> size the browser width down until the search box turns into an icon, and then click it repeatedly and you'll see it happen
[13:10:43] <stack> Velveeta: what I'm trying to do is actually reproduce my bug on that damn jsfiddle
[13:10:53] <bberry> Velveeta: <3
[13:12:34] <zakj> Lazuratus: if you don't mind a dependency on underscore.js, http://underscorejs.org/#difference
[13:13:31] <Lazuratus> Thx zakj, I'll check it out!
[13:16:54] <stack> ok I wasn't able to reproduce there because overflow:auto on the parent fixes the problem, and jsfiddle has this option on that frame
[13:17:24] <WebDragon> DOH
[13:18:12] <WebDragon> what about using dabblet instead ?
[13:18:24] <WebDragon> oh wait, no js there
[13:19:03] <Velveeta> how about jsbin
[13:19:28] <WebDragon> oh wait, cool
[13:19:34] <WebDragon> she added js
[13:20:01] <WebDragon> (apparently still in alpha test status, so file reports if stuff is wonky. Lea Verou is usually quite responsive :)
[13:20:20] <Denommus> Velveeta: I guess I should open an issue or a pull request for the jQuery team, then. If I have time at night, I'll check into that
[13:21:01] <Velveeta> denommus: if it's a legitimate jquery bug and you can fix it, definitely submit a pull request for the fix
[13:21:39] <Velveeta> bberry: i'm hitting a wall on your issue, the helper: 'clone' option doesn't appear to be working, and there are some zindex issues i've run into
[13:21:40] <WebDragon> mm no libraries though
[13:22:25] <Velveeta> i'm gonna switch gears to webdragon real quick and see if i can figure out what's going on there
[13:22:31] <bberry> Velveeta: Okay :(  i think it is a pretty difficult problem to solve.  I've been googling the crap out of it and cant find something that is my exact issue.
[13:24:04] <WebDragon> Velveeta: I'm almost tempted to leave it as is and just assume that a click on the box is meant to always activate the form and the only way to deactivate the button is to click somewhere else
[13:24:27] <WebDragon> but it irks me xD
[13:27:28] <Velveeta> webdragon: so you want the blur/hide behavior to only happen if it's *not* the icon being clicked on right?
[13:27:43] <Velveeta> e.g. if the user clicks on the icon while the form is open, just don't do anything, no blur/hide and then click/show
[13:28:28] <WebDragon> see, if the user clicks, the form is automatically blurred. which happens before the click event arrives
[13:28:46] <WebDragon> so it toggles the thing off, and then the click arrives on the icon and it toggles it back on again. whoops :D
[13:29:24] <WebDragon> if it was the icon itself that was clicked then the blur should happen, but the icon should not re-toggle back on
[13:29:34] <WebDragon> tricky
[13:30:50] <Velveeta> well, even if the click arrived before the blur, there wouldn't be a way for you to kill the blur event from happening
[13:31:02] <Velveeta> let me take a look at the js and see what i can do with it
[13:34:25] <regedit> how do i get the Jquery UI Modal Dialog, including the background overlay, but without any of the theme/styling?
[13:36:08] <Velveeta> regedit: you would need to go remove those portions of the css that you don't want
[13:36:34] <regedit> Velveeta: in the css? or in javascript?
[13:36:51] <Velveeta> should be in the jquery ui css
[13:36:54] <regedit> Velveeta: what about unwanted elements? like the dialog header etc
[13:37:07] <Velveeta> well that's a different question than what you asked..
[13:37:30] <regedit> i asked about getting the overlay without any other theme/styling stuff
[13:37:35] <Velveeta> if that's the case, you'll need to either roll your own dialog solution, or else have a function handler that fires on open, that removes the elements you don't want
[13:37:53] <Velveeta> right, theme/styling is css, not elements, element creation is part of the widget itself
[13:38:08] <regedit> well then i do ask that, then
[13:38:59] <regedit> i just want a modal and background overlay, but no theme related elements/styling
[13:40:32] <Velveeta> then you don't want the jquery ui dialog, because it comes with all of those extra elements.. if you just want, from what i'm guessing, you just want a div container with a modal background overlay, which should be easy enough to write a custom widget for
[13:41:41] <regedit> hm i guess
[13:41:46] <regedit> thanks
[13:48:16] <Velveeta> ok webdragon, here's an idea
[13:48:57] <Velveeta> how about you move your form wrapper to encompass the <p id="search-button"> and the ul, and then set your blur handler on the form itself
[13:49:33] <Velveeta> i'm not positive that blur will fire on a form tag itself though, so this is entirely a guess
[13:49:44] <WebDragon> yeah it depends on the browser methinks
[13:50:24] <Velveeta> the only other thing i can suggest would be to change your blur handler to a click handler and look for .closest('#header-search-wrapper').length, and if it's 0, hide the form
[13:50:38] <Velveeta> but that wouldn't account for people tabbing out of the field, only clicking elsewhere
[13:56:01] <WebDragon> hmmm
[13:56:23] <WebDragon> I think I may just leave it as is, and ignore my ocd-senses tingling
[13:56:27] <WebDragon> xD
[13:56:31] <Velveeta> heheheh
[13:58:14] <WebDragon> Velveeta: http://www.vitamin-ha.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OCD-Decision-W630.jpg

[14:08:46] <zizlee> hey guys is there a good plugin/tutorial on a vertical menu with sub-menu flyouts that slide out on hover?
[14:15:24] <apneic> Hi, what's the idiomatic way to merge 3+ associative arrays in jQuery?  $.extend() multiple times?
[14:16:34] <snover> apneic: define “merge”
[14:16:53] <zakj> apneic: $.extend takes variable args, e.g. $.extend(target, source1, source2, ...)
[14:17:14] <apneic> zakj: yep, I'd supply those arguments
[14:17:21] <apneic> zakj: I just cut a corner when describing my problem :-)
[14:17:39] <apneic> snover:  so let's say hash1 = { one: 'one' };  hash2 = { two: 'two' }
[14:17:59] <apneic> i want hash3 to be { one: 'one', two: 'two' }
[14:19:01] <zizlee> hey guys is there a good plugin/tutorial on a vertical menu with sub-menu flyouts that slide out on hover?
[14:19:18] <zakj> apneic: $.extend(hash3, hash1, hash2)
[14:19:37] <apneic> zakj: ok.  So what about N hashes?  can I just keep supplying arguments?
[14:19:46] <zakj> apneic: correct
[14:19:56] <apneic> zakj: ok thank you
[14:37:42] <io______> hi can you have a look at this? http://codepad.org/1UXtc5uV
[14:38:00] <io______> I am trying to do some background animation depending on the path
[14:40:15] <shoky> io______ you can't use || like that. you can write the whole condition twice, or use a regex, and/or a switch statement
[14:40:30] <shoky> if (a==b || a==c)
[14:40:44] <shoky> and i hope you don't expect the /* to automagically expand to anything
[14:46:49] <io______> shoky: thanks, is there anything like wildcards i can use?
[14:47:15] <io______> so that I can get mypath and mypath/* ?
[14:47:21] <shoky> io______: yes, regular expressions
[14:47:33] <io______> ok
[14:49:00] <shoky> you can also just check if a.indexOf(b) === 0  to check if string a begins with b
[14:50:11] <io______> yes i was thinking about that as the first part is what i want
[14:50:29] <io______> like using splt for example?
[14:51:02] <shoky> not needed for your example paste
[14:51:39] <io______> ok interesting
[14:56:23] <io______> shoky: how does this one look to you? http://codepad.org/fAL2l3sY
[14:56:56] <io______> mm probablyu missing the first slash
[14:57:33] <Erneston> anyone used green sock?
[15:04:43] <io______> thanks shoky I fixrd the errors I had there all working now
[15:11:37] <zakj> Erneston: yep, only a little bit but it's been solid for me
[15:13:32] <Erneston> cant get green sock basic example working
[15:16:02] <zakj> Erneston: can you paste your code somewhere?
[15:17:28] <Erneston> lol i can try
[15:23:33] <Zzaichik> wuh oh
[15:23:58] <Zzaichik> "lol I can try" isn't very reassuring
[15:26:17] <Erneston> finally: http://jsfiddle.net/YxBF8/19/
[15:26:32] <Erneston> doesnt work but its what i have on my screen offline
[15:30:06] <zakj> Erneston: What is scrollorama?
[15:30:19] <Erneston> a plugin
[15:30:29] <Erneston> which i cant get workking haha
[15:33:03] <zakj> Erneston: it looks like you're trying to call greensock methods (addTween) on the scrollorama object, which I assume would be a jQuery object
[15:34:48] <Erneston> i was trying to use super scrollerama but it said i must use greensock,
[15:34:57] <Erneston> i cant get super scrolelrama or greensock to work
[15:35:06] <Erneston> going to delete and start again
[15:50:46] <apneic> What's the standard plugin used to serialize objects into json?
[15:54:16] <Velveeta> 7.1 earthquake hits philippines
[15:54:19] <krambiorix> hi, i want to put a click handler on all divs with class "clickable"  . ALSO on divs which will be added in future with that class... How can i do that?
[15:54:46] <Velveeta> apneic: i wouldn't say there's a standard plugin, but rather a polyfill for JSON.stringify is probably the most popular
[15:55:11] <Velveeta> krambiorix: event delegation to the body for div.clickable
[15:55:24] <apneic> Velveeta: ok thank you
[15:55:25] <Velveeta> $('body').on('click', 'div.clickable', function () {} );
[15:56:45] <krambiorix> Velveeta, thanks again!! I'm sure you made lots of people happy today :D
[15:58:09] <Velveeta> pay it forward ;) go out there and get badass and come back and teach the next generation :D

[16:03:07] <LessSeen> livin Velveeta loca!
[16:04:09] <peko_pc1> Hi.
[16:05:28] <peko_pc1> Very noob question alert: Is this how most people link to jQuery:
[16:05:31] <peko_pc1> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
[16:11:27] <boze> is there a neat one liner for: if check-box is checked get check-box label? something like    var label = $('#checkbox:checked').next('label').val();
[16:15:06] <boze> peko_pc1: the "CDN" part of http://jquery.com/download/ talks about that : - )
[16:19:49] <Velveeta> boze: that looks like one line to me..
[16:19:57] <Velveeta> are you talking about a single selector?
[16:20:14] <Velveeta> lessseen: nice :D
[16:20:57] <Velveeta> peko_pc1: as for how most people link to jquery, it's entirely up to the person and the project… we download jquery and deploy it from our own servers, as i would imagine a lot of people do, but i would also imagine a lot of people use the cdn
[16:21:47] <boze> Velveeta: hmm single selector? that next('label').val(); doesn't seem to do it for me. Let me try again. The goal is to get the label text if the check box in question is checked
[16:22:13] <Velveeta> well, for one thing, labels don't have a 'value' attribute, so .val() isn't going to work on the label
[16:22:22] <boze> good point
[16:22:26] <boze> heh
[16:22:36] <Velveeta> also, the single selector is gonna depend on your markup structure… it looks like you have labels following your checkboxes, so you could use the adjacent sibling selector
[16:22:50] <Velveeta> $(':checked + label').text() would probably do what you're wanting
[16:23:39] <Velveeta> also, your original example was using '#checkbox:checked'… #checkbox is only gonna return the first element in the document with an id of 'checkbox', meaning if it's not checked, you're not gonna get any results with a selector like that
[16:25:53] <boze> Velveeta: You are sooo smooth thank you!
[16:26:09] <Velveeta> well played, sir.. well played
[16:26:18] <boze> $(':checked + label').text() works exactly like I wanted. I wasn't even close
[16:26:26] <Velveeta> :)
[16:28:20] <Velveeta> so i was craving an old fashioned… only, i didn't have any oranges… but i did have some really juicy limes, and said "hey, citrus… the cherry ought to balance that out"….. all that stuff i just said… don't ever do it...
[16:34:35] <boze> hehe on the rocks with a few drops of water for me!
[16:34:54] <boze> ,but wadda I no I'm a cheeze ball
[16:36:56] <Velveeta> yeah normally i just go whiskey rocks, and just let the ice water it as i drink, but tonight i wanted an actual cocktail of some kind.. my first thought was vesper, which probably would have been better given the lime situation
[16:40:40] <peko_pc1> boze and Velveeta: Thanks. Reading up now.
[16:42:09] <peko_pc1> Do you also know why http: is not in the url? It does work. I've never seen that kind of url before.
[16:43:41] <boze> I'd speculate that it's because it links to a file and not a webpage
[16:43:50] * boze shrugs
[16:44:20] <zakj> peko_pc1: http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/
[16:53:08] <peko_pc1> zakj: Ah. Thanks. Neat. I was suspecting it to be something like that.
[16:53:12] <peko_pc1> Good to know.
[17:02:11] <cam> What's the best way to scale an image by x% while keeping it's middle in the same x,y position? I basically want to "blow up" the image without moving it
[17:07:59] <zakj> cam: depending on the browser support you need, CSS's transform: scale(x%) should do what you want
[17:08:48] <eddief1029> or maybe something like: http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/
[17:13:20] <boze> whats a not stupid way to say if (arg1, 2, 3, 4 != ''){do it} The goal is if any of them are set to do it
[17:13:20] <Velveeta> depending on browser support though, i'd prefer the css method to the js method.. i think that only works in ie9+ on the M$ side though
[17:14:09] <Velveeta> boze: for something like that, i typically do something like if ($.inArray('do it', [arg1, 2, 3, 4]) !== -1)
[17:14:29] <Velveeta> you can use Array.prototype.indexOf too, as long as you polyfill it where it might not exist
[17:14:41] <Assimilater> i'm getting 404 errors that I think are the result of a url in the response html of an ajax call being pinged before being parsed as json, but I'm not 100% sure, could someone help me track down how it's occuring and how to prevent it? http://dot.aquaveo.com/
[17:14:45] <boze> dang, that went right over my head
[17:15:22] <boze> to the api i go!
[17:15:24] <Assimilater> the image(s) in question are in the second tab "Published Calculators"
[17:16:13] <zakj> boze: if I'm understanding your question correctly, underscore has a function for that you could steal: http://underscorejs.org/#some
[17:17:06] <dwarder> what kind of thing is this: var myvar = $(".class").find(".class2"), myvar2=10+myvar.length
[17:17:07] <zakj> boze: ... and Array.some is browser-native in good browsers (IE>=9)
[17:17:16] <dwarder> what does this mean?
[17:17:23] <dwarder> why comma?
[17:18:03] <boze> zakj: would I have to include the underscorejs library?
[17:18:08] <Assimilater> dwarder: you can declare variables "var myVar1 = 2; var myVar2 = 3;" or "var myVar1 = 2, myVar2 = 3;"
[17:18:18] <Assimilater> dwarder: the latter is generally preferred
[17:18:51] <zakj> boze: or just yank their implementation: http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-21
[17:19:18] <boze> i see
[17:19:20] <zakj> (sadly that function depends on some other bits of underscore)
[17:19:24] <boze> zakj: thanks
[17:19:39] <zakj> MDN has an Array.some polyfill, too https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[17:20:11] <dwarder> Assimilater: thank you
[17:20:30] <Assimilater> dwarder: np :)
[17:21:20] <Assimilater> i'm getting 404 errors that I think are the result of a url in the response html of an ajax call being pinged before being parsed as json, but I'm not 100% sure, could someone help me track down how it's occuring and how to prevent it? http://dot.aquaveo.com/ the image(s) in question are in the second tab "Published Calculators"
[17:25:07] <boze> Velveeta: how would that work in an if{}else{} if the if part is in side the ()
[17:25:19] <boze> O_o
[17:25:36] <Velveeta> boze: what do you mean?
[17:26:19] <Velveeta> assimilater: i'm looking at your issue, btw
[17:26:34] <dwarder> boozee is his real name
[17:26:36] <dwarder> ;)
[17:27:05] <dwarder> bboze i meant
[17:27:10] <boze> Velveeta:  sooooo if(something is set){ do it }else { do this other thang}    where's the other thang in ($.inArray('do it', [arg1, 2, 3, 4]) !== -1)
[17:27:22] <Velveeta> just 'else'
[17:27:37] <Velveeta> if it's not in that array, do one thing, else, do another thing
[17:27:38] <Assimilater> Velveeta: thanks, I avoid posting twice, but sometimes stuff gets lost when the channel is busy
[17:29:17] <boze> Velveeta: I'm dumb, is 'do it' the array name in this example? ^
[17:29:47] <Velveeta> well, you said you wanted to search to see if an array had 'do it' so that's what i used in my example
[17:30:21] <boze> i miscommunicated : - )
[17:30:34] <Velveeta> i think i misread
[17:30:42] <Velveeta> so you want to see if any array index is non-empty?
[17:31:35] <boze> I think so, if any of these variables are set, do this, otherwise, do something else
[17:32:40] <boze> I guess I can loop through and check each one, I figured there's some ninjary to be had though
[17:33:41] <Velveeta> yeah you could use $.grep and check the result's .length, but it'll loop through the entire array even if it finds a valid value in the first index
[17:34:07] <Velveeta> other than that, you could just run a $.each loop and set a boolean to true if you find something valid, and break out of the loop at that point
[17:34:29] <boze> that sounds fun
[17:34:31] * boze googles
[17:37:55] <RandalSchwartz> for http://jsfiddle.net/UgSkc/, I have a jq object on the <a> element.  I want to know how to get to the <b> inside the <p class="blink">
[17:38:16] <RandalSchwartz> it has to be the closest .blink to the a
[17:38:25] <RandalSchwartz> there are multiple items just like this at this level
[17:38:50] <RandalSchwartz> it's not .next(".blink"), because there's that <br> in there
[17:39:44] <RandalSchwartz> Oh.  maybe the first of .nextAll('.blink') ?
[17:40:34] <terinjokes> boze: you might be interested in "some" from the Lo-Dash project
[17:42:31] <RandalSchwartz> .nextAll('.blink').first() seems to do ti
[17:42:57] <boze> terinjokes: that looks good, thanks! zak j said something similar about _js  Now's I gotta figure out how they do it :)
[17:43:42] <boze> I'd like to avoid adding a library for one line : /
[17:45:16] <boze> i bet I can get the $.each to work.maybe
[17:45:19] <Assimilater> Velveeta: if you're still looking at it thanks, but I also gotta go to a meeting now, sorry about that, I was hoping this would be relatively simple to find and I was just missing something
[17:45:40] <Velveeta> i am still looking at it
[17:45:49] <Velveeta> i can let you know how far i've gotten, and maybe that'll help you continue it
[17:45:50] <terinjokes> boze: a while loop that does the check and breaks when it finds something that's true
[17:45:59] <Assimilater> ok
[17:46:33] <Velveeta> in assimilator.jquery.js, i set a breakpoint on 112: "methods.onSuccess(html);" … after the 6th time it hits that breakpoint, is when it throws the first 404 error for trying to fetch a no_image image
[17:46:52] <Velveeta> it looks to be doubling up all of the forward slashes, so path//to//my//no_image//file
[17:48:26] <Assimilater> it's curious, indeed
[17:48:30] <Assimilater> thanks so much for looking at it
[17:48:41] <Assimilater> if you're still on in a couple hours I'll be back at that point too
[17:48:58] <terinjokes> boze: see https://gist.github.com/terinjokes/7000980
[17:49:27] <terinjokes> boze: simplified version that does the same thing
[17:49:40] <boze> terinjokes: thanks that was fast, I was making a fiddle : - )
[17:50:55] <terinjokes> boze: the lodash version also handles objects and setting the this context of the callback, both very easy to do, but up to you to implement
[17:51:14] <terinjokes> (well, binding could be harder in certain browsers than others…)
[17:51:28] <boze> terinjokes: awesome, thank you very much!
[18:16:47] <randomdev> Could anyone help me get this example code (http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/ycUB6/670/) working properly, I renamed the #slider to the matching ul id, but I think I am doing something else wrong? http://setsonthebeach.com.au/v2/
[18:21:29] <Pistos> element.data('dollars');
[18:21:31] <Pistos> undefined
[18:21:33] <Pistos> element.attr('data-dollars');
[18:21:35] <Pistos> "150"
[18:21:37] <Pistos> Wait what?
[18:55:03] <ha1331_> Is there any way to remove up/down arrows from jquery mobiles text input that is "on date mode". I'dd like to have just the calendear popping button
[19:00:17] <jned> I have a <form action="/uploads" target="hidden-iframe"> and I have an iframe that is hidden so that when I submit my form, the page doesn't refresh or load "/uploads" and it works in chrome but in firefox it opens /uploads in a tab
[19:11:09] <k_sze[work]> If I had created a XMLHttpRequest or XDomainRequest using plain JavaScript (i.e. not using jQuery), can it be used as a Deferred object?
[19:11:53] <k_sze[work]> Or is there a way to wrap it as a Deferred object so I can use it in a $.when call?
[19:14:47] <randomdev> http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/ycUB6/670/ to make this code work in a page what do i need to wrap the javascript part in? just <script type="text/javascript">? or Does it need some more
[19:15:35] <hugo_moss> how can i preventdefault on all clicks on anywhere on my page?
[19:15:46] <hugo_moss> on the whole body
[19:23:18] <hugo_moss> hmm got it
[19:23:30] <hugo_moss> returning false works, but evt.preventdefault doesnt disable clicking
[19:24:20] <beachandbytes> evt.preventbubble
[19:28:46] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[19:28:48] <hugo_moss> thanks
[19:30:46] <randomdev> I have no idea what I'm doing
[19:46:22] <Velveeta> randomdev: wrap that in <script type="text/javascript"> and </script>
[19:46:34] <randomdev> i cant get it working for some reason
[19:46:57] <randomdev> have tried fooling around with $asj instead of $ etc
[19:47:13] <Velveeta> k_sze[work]: you can't just pair up a native xhr with a deferred object as far as i know.. jquery's ajax function manually returns resolves its own deferred object as part of its readyState check
[19:47:46] <randomdev> hmm i think its creating 2 sliders
[19:47:48] <randomdev> not updating the first
[19:47:54] <Velveeta> k_sze[work]: you could create a new deferred object, and bind some functionality to it, and manually resolve it yourself as part of your readyState check on the xhr, but you can't just say "deferred object, this is your xhr, when it's done, you fire your callbacks"
[19:48:23] <Velveeta> randomdev: i'm not sure what $asj is
[19:48:39] <randomdev> sorry this is the website http://setsonthebeach.com.au/v2/
[19:48:50] <randomdev> asj is just what the original slider is using for noconflict
[19:49:14] <Velveeta> gotcha
[19:49:47] <randomdev> i may just be misinterpreting the example.. but i cant see which part i need just to update the existing slider not create a new one
[19:50:26] <Velveeta> i have no clue what that plugin even is
[19:50:40] <randomdev> The original one is created with $asj('.anythingSlider').anythingSlider({ then a bunch of options, it looks like this is making another one with slider.anythingSlider();
[19:50:46] <randomdev> it is just an image slider
[19:51:06] <randomdev> hang on i will comment out the added code
[19:51:36] <randomdev> I am trying to use the example to reduce the number of 'slides' based on screen width
[19:52:10] <randomdev> it makes the list items in <ul id="slider118" slide
[19:52:43] <k_sze[work]> Velveeta: aaah
[19:53:13] <Velveeta> i really hate that everybody writes these kinds of things, which are stateful widgets, as friggin jquery plugins, and then simulate the behavior of the jquery ui widgets, rather than just building their code on the jquery ui factor
[19:53:15] <Velveeta> y
[19:53:21] <k_sze[work]> It's completely ok to set onreadystatechange on the XMLHttpRequest *after* send() anyway, right? (if I only care about state 4)
[19:54:04] <Velveeta> k_sze[work]: i'm not sure, i haven't done much work with native xhr objects, i use jquery pretty strictly in my ajax processes
[19:54:46] <boze> how could I check array values and if none are set, do this, else do something different http://jsfiddle.net/72KMZ/1/ <3
[19:54:47] <k_sze[work]> I'm trying to do this because there's a native xhr that I send before jQuery is loaded (to maximize parallelization)
[19:54:56] <flynn_> Hello everyone, how can I open an image showing up in a div, just by mousinghover it's thumbnail, I'de be more than happy to be pointed out to some plugins.
[19:55:39] <flynn_> Thank you very much in advance
[19:55:46] <Velveeta> boze: i answered that question earlier..
[19:55:54] <Assimilater> Velveeta: hey, you're still here
[19:56:04] <Velveeta> assimilater: i'm always here, like the lawnmower man
[19:56:05] <randomdev> flynn_, i would try and find a lightbox plugin then modify onclick to onmouseover
[19:56:09] <Assimilater> lol
[19:56:15] <boze> $.grep huh /me googles
[19:56:21] <Assimilater> so I realized when you told me what you discovered I really should have clarified a couple things
[19:56:32] <Velveeta> k_sze[work]: jquery only takes a handful of ms to load, you're trading overoptimization for a lack of ease in writing and maintaining your code
[19:56:57] <flynn_> thank you very much randomdev
[19:57:09] <Velveeta> flynn_: you can look into the hoverintent plugin also
[19:57:20] <Velveeta> that'll let you set a timeout for how long a person has to mouseover it before it opens
[19:57:34] <Velveeta> that way you're not popping things up the instant they mouseover an image, even when they're in transit to something else
[19:57:46] <Velveeta> assimilater: like what?
[19:57:51] <Assimilater> that $.doAjax method you discovered is just a mask so the site consistently checks for errors from the server and reports them to the user. The actual instance where that html is being manipulated can be found in aveo.Nodes.js (actually I load it with php)
[19:58:29] <Velveeta> assimilater: gotcha, can you gimme the link back to that page so i can check that file and see if i can spot anything fishy?
[19:58:39] <Assimilater> Velveeta: line 258 to be precise
[19:58:44] <Assimilater> http://dot.aquaveo.com
[19:58:48] <Velveeta> sweet
[19:59:38] <Velveeta> ahhh yes, i was here earlier :) once i stepped into that onSuccess function on the 6th time my breakpoint hit
[20:00:15] <Velveeta> the problem is that it fails somewhere between that 6th time hitting the breakpoint and the 7th time it hits it, and it's not failing inside that onSuccess function… once it exits, it's hitting something else that's crapping out
[20:01:10] <Assimilater> maybe something in the dataTables code?
[20:01:20] <Assimilater> i'm not 100% sure what their plugin does with that data
[20:02:01] <Assimilater> i'm really not sure why the request is even being made until it's rendered on the page (and it's obviously rendering fine, the html doesn't have those html-encoded slashes)
[20:05:52] <flynn_> Velveeta thank you
[20:06:01] <Velveeta> no problem
[20:11:55] <Assimilater> i wonder if it's a problem with the string replacement I do to avoid problems with quotes in html going through the json parser
[20:15:17] <Velveeta> where's that done at?
[20:15:59] <Assimilater> line 265 in the aveo.Nodes.js file
[20:35:04] <Assimilater> wow, this plugin continues to impress me, check out this debugger they have setup: http://debug.datatables.net/ihobur
[20:35:30] <Assimilater> they have a javascript funciton you can save as a bookmarklet and it uploads all this data to their server (that's from my page)
[21:03:42] <heshanh> hey guys i have a json result like this {"1":"widget 1","3":"widget 2"}, when i do 	$.each on it i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '30' in {"1":"widget 1","3":"widget 2"}
[22:32:54] <LoneSoldier728> anyone here have worked with backbone?
[22:40:55] <Mrgoose> does backbone.js still work with jquery mobile beta
[22:52:05] <sasmit87> I am using jquery validator. I want error message should change on check of radio button
[22:52:30] <sasmit87> check here http://dev.freshersworld.com/user/register
[22:53:48] <sasmit87> in marks label percentage should take between 30 to 100 and cgpa should take 3 to 10. That is working fine but i want on check of radio button validation should work
[22:59:55] <sasmit87> anybodyb is arround]\
[23:06:57] <x-finite> i was wondering if using jquery to position div elements instead of css is any helpful for smaller screens as compared to CSS?
[23:08:23] <jphase> x-finite: no, jQuery would just use CSS to position the divs anyhow
[23:08:44] <sasmit87> I am using jquery validator for this form  http://dev.freshersworld.com/user/register .  in marks label percentage should take between 30 to 100 and cgpa should take 3 to 10. That is working fine but i want on check of radio button also validation should work
[23:08:58] <goosie2020> Hey everyone
[23:09:15] <goosie2020> Has anyone in here ever used the load function?
[23:10:46] <jphase> goosie2020: sure
[23:10:56] <x-finite> jphase: but won't it use JS to calculate the positioning?
[23:11:27] <goosie2020> Cool. Well, Im trying to use it to load in a php file
[23:11:46] <goosie2020> so that I can have ajax refresh that part of the page every 3sec
[23:11:50] <jphase> x-finite: to calculate, yes, but it will position it with CSS. positioning divs is typically a job for CSS and CSS *can* be used to position things on every browser/platform/resolution. jQuery *can* also be used but that's a job for CSS imo
[23:12:07] <goosie2020> part everytime I it trys to load it in...nothing gets loaded
[23:12:24] <jphase> goosie2020: erros in the console about cross-domain requests by chance?
[23:12:36] <goosie2020> Hm, let me check
[23:12:51] <goosie2020> Heres a good summary of what I'm trying to do for the most part
[23:12:52] <goosie2020> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19312996/update-dynamic-table-with-jquery-and-ajax
[23:13:01] <goosie2020> Look at the answer to the question
[23:13:07] <jphase> sasmit87: hmm, you'll probably need to do some custom validation for that
[23:13:19] <sasmit87> how?
[23:13:45] <sasmit87> 	like you checked cgpa and enter 9 in text field it is correct but then without changing the text filed if you select perecentage radion button error message should give
[23:14:25] <goosie2020> No nothing in the console
[23:15:25] <sasmit87> Can i use depends here
[23:15:32] <jphase> sasmit87: you'd have to bind into the submit event on that form and prevent it from submitting (and then add an 'error' class on those elements) if it doesn't have your values
[23:16:02] <jphase> sasmit87: yeah probably, I don't usually use depends on their callbacks but that might work just fine, I'd have to look at their API
[23:16:25] <jphase> goosie2020: can you hastebin.com your code or do you have a working example?
[23:16:39] <sasmit87> I was trying that also but it did not work
[23:16:41] <jphase> goosie2020: jsfiddle would also work great ;)
[23:17:05] <jphase> sasmit87: can I show you a working example that doesn't apply to what you need but you can see how some short example works?
[23:17:09] <goosie2020> ah i think i just figured out whats going on
[23:17:18] <goosie2020> ...how to fix it...i havent yet
[23:17:20] <goosie2020> one sec
[23:17:21] <sasmit87> in rule i put like this
[23:17:28] <sasmit87> marks:
[23:17:30] <sasmit87> 				{
[23:17:31] <sasmit87> 					required:{
[23:17:33] <sasmit87> 						depends: function (element) {
[23:17:34] <sasmit87>                         return $("#marksType").prop("checked");
[23:17:36] <sasmit87>                    		 }
[23:17:37] <sasmit87>                    	},	
[23:17:39] <sasmit87> 					range:[30,100]
[23:17:40] <sasmit87> 				},
[23:17:47] <Cork> ?p
[23:18:08] <Cork> sasmit87: never dump code in the channel
[23:18:15] <sasmit87> ok
[23:18:39] <jphase> sasmit87: please don't paste in here... also, you'll need to something like set a var valid = false;   then check to see if that's checked AND the value of the text is what you want, then set valid to true and return valid var
[23:19:14] <sasmit87> you can check here http://pastebin.com/uKCFK2Up
[23:19:48] <jphase> sasmit87: something that will make your code a lot less lengthy is to just add class="required" to your elements too btw
[23:21:44] <jphase> sasmit87: but yeah, on that custom spot, I'd do something like http://hastebin.com/huwihoxeqo.coffee
[23:22:07] <jphase> you may need to play with that obviously but that's the gist
[23:22:30] <sasmit87> thankx let me try that
[23:23:29] <sasmit87> but where to return that valid
[23:23:33] <goosie2020> the problem is
[23:23:38] <goosie2020> isnt JS
[23:24:12] <jphase> sasmit87: that was an example for you depends usage
[23:24:54] <jphase> sasmit87: again, I'd read up on their API cause I normally do custom validation with their plugin to set my own labels and such, but I'm sure that will work just fine if their API says it will
[23:26:08] <jphase> goosie2020: If you want to hastebin or jsfiddle your code for us to look at someone can try to help you.
[23:27:54] <x-finite> jphase: i am using this http://pastebin.com/yizpapXu to center a DIV container with JS and it works fine but when I am using CSS to center it using margin-left: 50% and margin-top: 50% .. the DIV disappears from the screen .. setting the horizontal margin to 40% and vertical to 18% right about centers the container .. but i am not happy with how this is achieved .. any suggestions?
[23:29:23] <adammcarth> Hey guys. Is it possible to make a post request using jQuery => my server handles it and outputs a json reponse => and then I retrieve the outputted json afterwards using jQuery
[23:29:29] <jphase> x-finite: more of a question for #css but is the div position relative or absolute/fixed?
[23:30:25] <jphase> adammcarth: yeah, look up $.post  or  $.ajax  for that
[23:30:40] <x-finite> jphase: its fixed
[23:30:57] <jphase> x-finite: then use left: 50%;  and then use margin-left: -1/2 the width of the div
[23:31:07] <jphase> same with the vertical
[23:31:14] <jphase> top: 50%; margin-top: -1/2 the height
[23:31:52] <adammcarth> jphase: Thanks for the response. Yeah, it's strange - I've been using $.ajax, but it's not working. Error message it throws is Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of undefined
[23:31:57] <adammcarth> Got no idea what that means though
[23:32:32] <jphase> adammcarth: yeah, your response/success/done function has something.ownerDocument in it perhaps?  do you have code we can look at?
[23:33:12] <thump_> when to use .post vs .ajax?
[23:33:48] <jphase> thump_: I personally use .ajax when I need to specify a particular dataType and such, .post is just a wrapper for .ajax with less options
[23:34:19] <adammcarth> jphase: I don't anywhere in my javascript file :/. Here's a gist: https://gist.github.com/adammcarthur/7003472
[23:34:26] <thump_> jphase: basically always use .ajax :-)
[23:34:29] * jphase uses .post, .get and .getJSON for his typical ajax requests, only falls back to .ajax when the first 3 don't do what I need
[23:34:52] <adammcarth> thump_: jphase: Yeah, $.post just emulates $.ajax anyway :P
[23:34:55] <jphase> thump_: no, I just use .ajax when I need to, otherwise I use the others. they all work
[23:35:02] <jphase> yeah
[23:35:22] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[23:35:25] <jphase> but if I don't need to pass a dataType, just need a standard ajax request with POST, then I use the alias
[23:35:27] <LoneSoldier728> anyone here use backbone?
[23:35:29] <thump_> .ajax is for pros.
[23:35:35] <jphase> nah
[23:35:58] <jphase> same with how I use .click instead of .on  ... I use the aliases jQuery provides because they're convenient
[23:36:00] <LoneSoldier728> damn trying to figure out how to separate an array i send back as a result in backbone
[23:36:11] <jphase> it's not "cooler" to make the syntax longer in my opinion
[23:36:14] <jphase> they're all the same though ;)
[23:36:21] <LoneSoldier728> and turn it into multiple pages without the page changing but just the views
[23:36:29] <jphase> well, yeah, not all the same but w/e
[23:36:53] <adammcarth> Sinatra is for pros, but that's a story for cooler channel
[23:37:04] <adammcarth> for a*
[23:38:05] <adammcarth> Sorry jphase, I left out  `var commentForm = $("#commentForm")`  :P
[23:38:06] <jphase> hehe, sinatra is pretty fun yeah
[23:39:09] <adammcarth> controllers and routes in the one file!? Genius.
[23:39:40] <jphase> hehe, yeah a lot of good MVC frameworks do that though imo
[23:39:53] <jphase> *cough* sails.js / node.js ftw *cough*
[23:40:03] <adammcarth> lolol
[23:40:08] <adammcarth> Any ideas on my gist?
[23:40:09] <jphase> adammcarth: are there any errors in this gist?
[23:40:15] <jphase> jinx
[23:40:26] <adammcarth> I'm relatively new two jQuery, but I can't see why the fuck this doesn't work
[23:40:38] <adammcarth> Not that I know of
[23:41:09] <jphase> I mean in console?
[23:41:42] <adammcarth> Oh.
[23:41:46] <adammcarth> Just that one I said before
[23:41:56] <adammcarth> it fires every time I submit the commentForm
[23:42:37] <jop008> is it possible to use css in mail message?
[23:42:44] <jphase> adammcarth: well your gist doesn't have the event it fires on so I can't really help troubleshoot event issues atm
[23:43:25] <jphase> jop008: yeah, not a question for #jquery but yes, it's possible... only application for inline styles btw ;)
[23:43:42] <anli_> I wish I could cut and paste in jsfiddle...
[23:43:59] <anli_> Oh, now I could
[23:44:04] <jphase> anli_: you can, ctrl/cmd + x, cmd/ctrl + v
[23:44:19] <anli_> Strange, because previously, I could not even select the text
[23:44:55] <anli_> Are variables and functions in two separate namespaces? http://jsfiddle.net/2cN9c/
[23:45:01] <adammcarth> jphase: Refresh (https://gist.github.com/adammcarthur/7003472) for updated code
[23:45:08] <adammcarth> That's the full thing
[23:45:36] <jphase> adammcarth: hmm, function(event){    event.preventDefault();    for starters
[23:45:54] <jphase> or you could also return false; at the end of that
[23:46:39] <jop008> thx jphase
[23:46:40] <jphase> anli_: you defined num in global namespace so it's available elsewhere  (the functions below)
[23:46:44] <jphase> np
[23:46:57] <anli_> It not about num, but the function tr
[23:47:03] <anli_> Together with the local variable tr
[23:47:27] <jphase> anli_: when you define a var within a function it's only available to that function
[23:47:33] <anli_> yes?
[23:47:43] <anli_> And the function is also defined in the function
[23:47:46] <jphase> anli_: you could define it globally and set it within that function instead, or call the function and return the value you need
[23:47:50] <anli_> They are not different when it comes to scope
[23:48:16] <jphase> well the vars in the top function are available to the functions below
[23:48:27] <jphase> not visa versa
[23:48:32] <goosie2020> oops sorry didnt mean to pm...meant to do the msg thing like you did to me
[23:48:35] <anli_> It is more about name collisions, not scope
[23:48:39] <jphase> they're available within the closure you work in
[23:48:45] <jphase> oh yeah
[23:48:48] <jphase> like var tr?
[23:48:53] <anli_> yes
[23:49:08] <anli_> How can var tr and function tr coexist?
[23:49:12] <jphase> you wouldn't set var tr in the tr() function
[23:49:25] <jphase> well... you shouldn't really do that but it may be possible
[23:49:34] <jphase> I normally try to keep those different though
[23:49:38] <anli_> Why?
[23:49:39] <jphase> because a var in JS can easily be a function
[23:49:50] <anli_> Then again, how can they coexist
[23:49:50] <jphase> var farts = function(omg){ return omg; }
[23:50:20] <Cork> anli_: they can't
[23:50:23] <jphase> anli_: that's probably a question for Cork or someone a bit more advanced in oop JS than I, I typically avoid that personally but I'm curious as well
[23:50:25] <jphase> haha
[23:50:29] <jphase> spoke to l8
[23:50:40] <anli_> Cork: And how does the code run as I wanted then?
[23:51:22] <Cork> anli_: when you declare a function <name>() in a function
[23:51:30] <anli_> yes
[23:51:34] <Cork> it is grabbed in a pre parse through the code
[23:51:43] <Cork> this means it is defined BEFORE the code runs
[23:51:49] <Cork> that creates tr
[23:51:56] <Cork> then when the code runs line 7
[23:52:02] <Cork> you replace the tr function with the value from tr
[23:52:09] <Cork> the tr function is then gone in that instance
[23:52:14] <Cork> can't be called again
[23:52:16] <anli_> So then I cannot call tr again
[23:52:17] <anli_> ah
[23:52:20] <anli_> thanks
[23:52:23] <anli_> Makes sense
[23:55:37] <jphase> hey Cork, have you worked much with content editable stuff?
[23:55:49] <jphase> the native document functions particularly
[23:56:04] <sasmit87> jphase: still i  am not able to do that
[23:56:06] <jphase> I seem to be having issues with increaseFont and random things
[23:56:46] <jphase> sasmit87: hmm, try binding the the form's submit event instead of using the depends callback perhaps
[23:57:01] <sasmit87> I tried like this http://hastebin.com/jovuyipiru.coffee
[23:57:32] <sasmit87> I need to do that even in onblur
[23:58:01] <Cork> jphase: some
[23:58:03] <sasmit87> I mean before submitting on check of radio button
[23:58:27] <anli_> Is foo.html("<input type='checkbox'/>"); ok or should I foo.html($("<input type='checkbox'/>")); just because of the trailing slash
[23:58:48] <Cork> anli_: the second is pointless
[23:59:13] <Cork> anli_: though in the first case the extra / is pointless too
[23:59:34] <anli_> But its jquery that interprets the string in case 2, right?
