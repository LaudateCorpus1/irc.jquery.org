[00:02:48] <Enerel> jquery faceout div, but the image is fading out too slow anyidea?
[00:22:30] <seemikehack> Hey all, hope someone's on :) can I attach data to more than just the URL when intercepting link click events? Like body params, for example.
[00:33:17] <Enerel> i want to fadeOut div, but image in it fades out very slow, how can i fadeOut images faster?
[00:33:51] <seemikehack> Enerel, http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[00:35:15] <Enerel> why animate if there is function called fadeOut
[00:37:28] <seemikehack> OK, fine: http://api.jquery.com/fadeout/
[00:37:43] <seemikehack> The point is that there's a duration option that you can pass to animation functions.
[00:38:06] <seemikehack> Or you can pass an options object that specifies a duration.
[00:38:40] <Enerel> i set the duration to a div but image in the div only goes away when div is completly fades away
[00:39:24] <Enerel> maybe sequence first image and div?
[00:39:42] <Enerel> but when i try remove image first and fadeout it does not work
[00:39:58] <seemikehack> Code?
[00:40:03] <seemikehack> Wait.
[00:40:14] <Enerel> $(".cover > img").remove(); $(".cover").fadeOut(2000);
[00:40:22] <seemikehack> What I meant was, "Do you have a working example in jsfiddle, jsbin, or codepen?"
[00:40:35] <seemikehack> See, that was exactly what I was trying to avoid :)
[00:41:11] <Enerel> you mean not in sequence
[00:41:49] <Enerel> live link: http://www.nos.mn/kinotime/
[00:41:59] <Enerel> it is a page loader
[00:43:10] <seemikehack> So is the issue that the movie tiles fade in faster than the loader fades out?
[00:44:21] <Enerel> the logo fades out slower then the loader div
[00:47:13] <Cork> Enerel: so you animate an element and img tags inside it fade slower??
[00:47:26] <Enerel> yes
[00:47:42] <Cork> that... isn't actually possible unless the browser is broken
[00:47:51] <Enerel> Cork since you are here can i ask more difficult question
[00:48:01] <Cork> fadeOut changes opacity on the element you run fadeOut on
[00:48:12] <Enerel> i see
[00:48:21] <seemikehack> Enerel, why don't you just fade the div out and not worry about the image?
[00:48:29] <Cork> so all child elements should just fade the same amount
[00:48:32] <seemikehack> Enerel, it probably will fade with the div.
[00:48:39] <Cork> seemikehack: that is what fadeOut does
[00:48:54] <seemikehack> Enerel, see, there you go :)
[00:49:01] <Enerel> okay
[00:49:09] <Cork> Enerel: what you see might be that the images has more color then the rest
[00:49:19] <Cork> so it takes longer for them to go invisible
[00:49:27] <Enerel> oh got it
[00:49:57] <Cork> Enerel: also, don't ask to ask, just ask
[00:49:58] <slyslick> hey guys, newbie looking for some help
[00:50:10] <slyslick> http://codepen.io/sgregg85/pen/xVEPZN
[00:50:20] <Enerel> Cork: http://www.nos.mn/kinotime/ when you resize window i have sidebar with dynamic content
[00:50:40] <slyslick> my 'Get Quote' button does nothing and I cant seem to figure out why
[00:50:48] <Enerel> the sidebar dynamic links does not trigger
[00:51:31] <Cork> Enerel: heh, i didn't mean ask it to me ^^
[00:51:35] <Enerel> i tried DELEGATE i use jquery 1.11 but still same, sidebar does nothing
[00:52:39] <Enerel> i could not figure out the problem, asked multiple times here no answer
[00:52:43] <Cork> slyslick: you need to use $(function() {}) around your js to wait for the document to be loaded
[00:53:12] <Cork> slyslick: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[00:53:48] <slyslick> I have tried that and it still didnt work, I took it out because codepen says its not needed because they put the code before the closing body tag so the doc is already loaded then
[00:55:01] <Cork> Enerel: start by reducing the complexity in the testcase
[00:55:13] <Cork> there are too many moving parts to even get that page loading...
[00:55:39] <Cork> ah
[00:55:43] <slyslick> Cork: I put the code between  $(document).ready(function() {}); and $(function() {} and neither worked for me
[00:56:10] <Cork> slyslick: you bind a click handler on #getQuote and listen for events from child buttons
[00:56:25] <Cork> but #getQuote IS the button so there can't be child buttons
[00:56:34] <Enerel> roger that Cork
[00:56:43] <Cork> either use $('#getQuote').on(
[00:56:45] <Cork> påås
[00:56:49] <Cork> *opps
[00:57:01] <Cork> either use $('#getQuote').on('click', func)
[00:57:13] <Cork> or move the element you bind the event on to a parent
[00:58:03] <Cork> slyslick: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[00:58:55] <slyslick> that is how I had it before, I added the 'button' because I was testing something I saw online trying to fix it
[01:00:49] <Enerel> Cork can you wait until i reduce the script
[01:01:25] <Cork> Enerel: i'll have to go to work in about 15 mins, so... no
[01:01:36] <slyslick> Cork: I am making a note of your links to read later but I have been at this for 9 days trying to get this working so I have done quite a bit of research and tried lots of different fixes but to no avail
[01:01:57] <Enerel> http://nos.mn/kinotime/index2.php only isotope and cbflyout  nothing else
[01:03:37] <slyslick> Cork: Anything else you see that may be wrong, I have reverted both things you mentioned back to the way they were and still nothing
[01:04:47] <slyslick> or anyone else who may be able to help if Cork is busy
[01:05:11] <Enerel> he is busy watching my script
[01:26:01] <Enerel> anyone know jalvarado91

[01:28:03] <_August_> can someone point me in the right direction. I have a list of keywords and i want to populate an input field with the list of keywords but i dont want them to exceed 10 keywords if there are more than 10. I know how to get the number of keywords and how to populate them into the input field but i dont know how to put a cap on how many I want in the field.
[01:28:08] <_August_> any suggestions?
[01:50:33] <_August_1> nvm -_-

[05:19:14] <naftilos76> Hi everyone, i am using .on("ajax:success ....) but even if i get a 200 response from the server the ajax:error fires instead of ajax:success. Please have a look https://gist.github.com/anonymous/020664e20cc72d8e810c
[05:19:40] <naftilos76> I had a look in the internet but could find a solution
[05:19:48] <naftilos76> could not
[05:21:03] <naftilos76> While this approach works flawlessly on most of my prev coding, it just started not working and i wonder why
[05:21:10] <naftilos76> cna anybody help?
[06:55:14] <paulvd> what does this error mean ? any idea ? TypeError: m.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[06:55:40] <slax0r> that m.easing array item with key this.easing is not a function
[06:57:01] <paulvd> eh that i also know
[06:57:22] <paulvd> but why does this happen :S
[06:58:09] <slax0r> because it doesn't contain a function definition but something else, or it doesn't exist
[06:58:16] <slax0r> the item with that key I mean
[06:58:31] <slax0r> that's about all the help I can give you with that information
[07:01:15] <paulvd> ...
[07:03:17] <shoky> paulvd: that has to do with jquery animations. you're probably missing jquery-ui or jquery easings
[07:03:39] <paulvd> hm
[07:03:40] <paulvd> ok
[09:09:54] <jop008> anyone using jqwidgets?
[09:47:59] * dddh__ is back
[09:48:09] <dddh__> is it possible to catch f5 reload ?
[09:48:53] <taplar> probably could catch the key event
[09:49:37] <dddh__> hm, I will try it
[09:49:56] <taplar> or if your just wanting to catch them leaving the page you might be after the unload event
[09:53:46] <albedoa> hello. if you have a bunch of list items which do similar thing on-click, is it better to attach an event to each individually or on the whole set (and then use data atrributes or something to differentiate)?
[09:54:29] <dddh__> taplar: I want to catch f5 and reload json/parse/display new data instead of window reload
[09:54:35] <Xatenev> taplar: dddh a page reloda will first create an unload event
[09:54:47] <Xatenev> reload*
[09:55:08] <shoky> albedoa: it's better to use event delegation,  setting only one event listener on a container element, the click events from inside will bubble up to that container. see docs for .on() for info
[09:55:20] <Xatenev> dddh__ use the unload event then.
[09:55:26] <albedoa> shoky  thank you
[09:56:56] <taplar> i think it's kinda interesting if you go to the jqm download page it says you should use the custom builder, but then when you go there it says it's in alpha, don't use it on prod!  heh
[09:59:15] <dddh__> Xatenev: ok, I'll try
[10:00:01] <dddh__> Xatenev: on page with search filters and "reload" button users press f5 :(
[10:00:44] <Xatenev> dddh__: Yea you can use the beforeunload event to trigger a message such as "Do you really wanna reload?"
[10:01:00] <Xatenev> dddh__: of course you cant completely stop them from refreshing because that would be pretty bad for the users xD
[10:01:09] <dddh__> they reset all filters when they reload page, imho it's better to have separate "reset search filters" and "reload", but not use F5
[10:02:14] <dddh__> Xatenev: I know about window.beforeunload, but I wanted to have something that will just work, with no alerts
[10:03:00] <Xatenev> dddh__: You cant just prevent people from refreshing
[10:03:29] <Xatenev> dddh__: thats an application problem, save the filters in the session instead of preventing the user from reloading ._.
[10:04:00] <albedoa> shoky thanks again for the lead on the .on() docs. direct/delegated info is exactly what i was looking for
[10:04:45] <dddh__> I wish this alert was like "every time you press F5 god kills a kitten" or similar
[10:05:57] <taplar> they don't have to press F5.  there's also the refresh button on the browser
[10:05:58] <dddh__> http://preview.images.memegenerator.net/Instance/Preview?imageID=97209&generatorTypeID=&panels=&text0=every%20time%20you%20press%20F5&text1=god%20kills%20a%20kitten&text2=&text3=
[10:06:27] <dddh__> or ctrl+R
[10:13:43] <Omar-> if I have an element with z-index zero (default) and I want to insert an element behind it (without setting z-index), using .before() should do the job right?
[10:14:51] <slax0r> Omar-: tias?
[10:15:00] <Omar-> the second element is in DOM but hidden, should you $elm.clone().before() or just $elm.before()?
[10:15:17] <Omar-> slax0r: que?
[10:15:33] <slax0r> Omar-: Try It And See?
[10:16:01] <Omar-> slax0r: it's not working
[10:16:22] <Omar-> $elm2.before(".elm1")
[10:16:27] <NoiseEee> Omar-: set up a fiddle
[10:16:48] <slax0r> Omar-: also, z-index is not 0 by default, it's auto
[10:17:05] <Omar-> NoiseEee I have a plnkr but you need touch device or devtools
[10:17:09] <slax0r> and auto means stack order equal to parents
[10:17:39] <Omar-> slax0r: yes, depends on their order in DOM. .zIndex() returns 0
[10:18:05] <Omar-> NoiseEee http://plnkr.co/edit/HrUSPJmLZVF0FWP3Ur7d
[10:21:44] <Omar-> I guess I'm using .before() in reversed way
[10:24:32] <Omar-> yeah, my bad. sorry guys that was dumb.
[10:24:39] <NoiseEee> np :)
[10:25:01] <Omar-> I didn't come near jquery in really long time
[10:37:33] <hahnberger> anybody here good with datatables?

[11:11:27] <shoky> i was going to say - i wonder how many people here are now looking for where they can purchase that book
[11:12:10] <shoky> then i.. looked for it
[11:12:18] <taplar> lol
[11:12:29] <shoky> it exists :p sort of
[11:13:24] <dddh__> first time I saw it I thought it was a joke, but recently found it on goodreads ..
[11:14:40] <jomofcw> Is there a way to retrieve the HTML of an element, including itself ? e.g. I want "$('div#myID').html();" to return something like "<div id="myID">innerHTML</div>".
[11:14:43] <jomofcw> Please.
[11:15:43] <NoiseEee> outerHTML
[11:15:55] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/outerHTML
[11:17:57] <shoky> .prop('outerHTML')
[11:17:59] <BillCriswell> .prop('outerHTML') or [0].outerHTML essentially.
[11:18:28] <shoky> woah BillCriswell
[11:18:52] <BillCriswell> shoky: I have not been helping out in here as often as I should. =(
[11:19:18] <shoky> long time since i've seen you here. unless i'm remembeing the name wrong
[11:19:40] <BillCriswell> It's probably me haha
[11:20:01] <BillCriswell> I haven't spoken in here for a really long time and I have no idea why.
[11:23:11] <NoiseEee> real work/
[11:23:13] <NoiseEee> ?
[11:25:46] <jomofcw> Thanks both of you anyway :P.
[11:25:49] <decx> like that ever stopped anyone
[11:28:47] <BillCriswell> @NoiseEee Haha nah. Just playing around with others things more and trying to help out there as well.
[11:28:54] <BillCriswell> Been messing around a lot with Vue.
[11:37:10] <PSan> hi how to disable user input without using disabled or read-only
[11:37:37] <taplar> you could cancel all keydown events
[11:38:03] <taplar> and change
[11:39:05] <taplar> or hide the input and show a view only field
[11:39:10] <taplar> *shrug*
[11:39:33] <PSan> I think I'll take the event cancel route
[11:50:49] <JD-Robbs> Does anyone know how to get jquery-ui 1.11.4 via npm? Looks like the packages are outdated. I'm wanting to use it with webpack.
[12:23:44] <evilbug> hi
[12:24:09] <robertmaxrees> hola
[12:29:03] <evilbug> what's shaking on this fine tuesday morning?
[12:37:57] <rawteech> #css-chassis
[12:52:09] <taplar> b-b-b-beef tips
[12:53:27] <Uhkis> taplar: grill before consuming
[12:53:47] <taplar> i'm assuming these were baked
[12:54:17] <taplar> or stewed, *shrug*
[12:54:45] <Uhkis> then why were you asking for tips? :-D
[12:54:56] <taplar> lol, nice
[13:17:56] <JD-Robbs> Seriously, why doesn't anyone update the jquery-ui package on npm? I mean, the npm package even got a mention in the release notes of 1.12-rc. But it's still at 1.10 (a year old). :D
[13:18:29] <duch_kazatel> i'd ask in #jquery-dev
[13:18:32] <duch_kazatel> they might not know.
[13:18:41] <JD-Robbs> ah oops, thanks :)
[14:17:07] <YokoBR> hi there

[14:49:31] <cagmz> I have a calendar that is contains cells and I select the first day of the month with return $(".dx-calendar-cell span:contains('1')");. However, the last days of my calendar show the next month, where the dates roll over to 1 again. Is this snippet guaranteed to return the first span that has a 1?
[14:52:11] <duch_kazatel> only contains 1.
[15:12:00] <catbeard> is there a way to detect a successful "check" on a google checkmark recaptcha and enable a form submit button?
[15:21:40] <NoiseEee> catbeard: surely the google capctcha API has this all spellled out?

[15:39:53] <cluelessperson> Hi all.  Am I doing this right?
[15:39:53] <cluelessperson> http://hastebin.com/zahogogaro.coffee
[15:45:06] <spoonUltra> Can anyone reccommend a simple smooth scrolling walkthrough?
[15:46:43] <duch_kazatel> cluelessperson nope.
[15:46:53] <duch_kazatel> window.setInterval(LoadIssues, 60000); - no parens
[15:48:05] <cluelessperson> duch  with parens, it runs on load, without, it doesn't run on load
[15:48:11] * cluelessperson waiting awhile to see if ti runs
[15:49:00] <robertmaxrees> cluelessperson setInterval expects a reference to a function.  putting the parens there runs the function immediately and assigns its return to be run instead.
[15:49:12] <robertmaxrees> so basically it's trying to run 'undefined()'
[15:49:15] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want.
[15:49:23] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, ah, okay.  So I run it, then put it in the interval
[15:49:27] <robertmaxrees> you need to run the function once right before you set the interval.
[15:49:32] <robertmaxrees> but that code makes an assumpion.
[15:49:34] <cluelessperson> Excellent, works
[15:49:55] <robertmaxrees> you're assuming that the previous call will finish before the next is made.
[15:50:04] <robertmaxrees> you should really use a recursive setTimeout call instead.
[16:27:30] <cluelessperson> $('.event').click(function(){
[16:27:30] <cluelessperson>     $('#acknowledge .event').val($(this).attr('id'));
[16:27:30] <cluelessperson>     $('#acknowledge').removeClass('hidden');  });
[16:27:33] <cluelessperson> I have this
[16:27:34] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[16:27:39] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, wut
[16:27:40] <robertmaxrees> hey please don't do multiline pastes :)
[16:27:50] <robertmaxrees> use a service instead :)
[16:27:56] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, why, it's 3 lines.
[16:28:04] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it spams the channel.
[16:28:15] <robertmaxrees> not a big deal, just asying.
[16:28:42] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees,   It very much irritates me that you're bothered by my three lines, when 99% of the channel is people leaving/joining.  -_-*
[16:28:52] <cluelessperson> lol
[16:28:53] <robertmaxrees> i can hide the join/part messages.
[16:29:03] <cluelessperson> robertmaxrees, how do you know if someone left or not?
[16:29:14] <robertmaxrees> why would i need to know in most cases?
[16:29:23] <robertmaxrees> either way, it's really not a big deal - just saying.
[16:29:26] <cluelessperson> Good point!
[16:29:29] * cluelessperson hides the messages.
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[16:42:16] <z1haze> doesn anyone know the differece between the datatables and data-tables-dt npm packages??
[16:43:32] <robertmaxrees> have a link to that second one?
[16:44:17] <robertmaxrees> searching for data-tables-dt in npm doesn't give me any results.
[16:52:14] <jose3_> robertmaxrees:
[16:52:33] <jose3_> robertmaxrees:  Have you ever used the jquery library Masonry ?
[16:53:10] <robertmaxrees> it's not a jquery plugin necessarily, but i have some familiarity.
[16:53:59] <jose3_> Does this mean anything to you : $grid.masonry('layout');
[16:54:09] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:54:14] <robertmaxrees> could you just ask your question.
[16:54:19] <jose3_> I am having trouble manually re-arranging the grid
[16:54:25] <jose3_> yes you may
[16:54:48] <robertmaxrees> no i mean instead of asking if a method call "means" something to me, just tell me what problem you're having.
[16:56:31] <jose3_> Oh that was it, well the reason I ask is because its specific to the library. But basically whenever you make an adjustment to the grid it should re-organize the grid-items. I have created a method that deletes grid-items if they have content. After I .remove() the item, I am unable to tell masonry using the above command, that the grid needs to be
[16:56:31] <jose3_> re-organized
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> so you want to remove an item and have the grid do its thing.
[16:57:11] <jose3_> precisely
[16:57:22] <robertmaxrees> http://masonry.desandro.com/methods.html#remove
[16:57:25] <robertmaxrees> just use this.
[16:57:29] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/xOqpv3Ao/
[16:58:24] <jose3_> Hmmm, I looked at those docs already, but I shall re-examine them
[16:58:36] <robertmaxrees> that link literally takes you to the remove method.
[17:05:46] <jose3_> what is your preferred framework?
[17:05:50] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[17:05:56] <jose3_> for fun
[17:06:11] <robertmaxrees> i don't really work that way tbh.
[17:06:17] <robertmaxrees> like, i pick the right tool for the job.
[17:08:27] <DeltaHeavy> jose3_ Don't use a framework unless you're building something compelx like an SPA.
[17:08:34] <jose3_> spa?
[17:08:42] <robertmaxrees> single-page application.
[17:08:44] <xdevnull> DeltaHeavy, O_O !
[17:08:56] <jose3_> ohhh
[17:08:57] <xdevnull> DeltaHeavy, O_O who said that?
[17:09:17] <DeltaHeavy> xdevnull Me?
[17:09:17] <jose3_> Ive never used any kind of js frameworks, or any framework for that matter
[17:09:20] <jose3_> just Rails
[17:09:21] <DeltaHeavy> Complex -LIKE- an SPA
[17:09:29] <robertmaxrees> then you've used a framework.
[17:09:33] <robertmaxrees> rails IS a framework for ruby,
[17:09:46] <jose3_> I sure do miss rails
[17:10:00] <DeltaHeavy> jose3_ For front end JS it's popular to use a collection of libraries to achieve what a monolithic framework would achieve. If you want something LIKE RoR for front end dev check out EmberJS.
[17:10:13] <DeltaHeavy> React + Redux/Flux is popular right now though. That said, don't use that stuff unless you need to :p
[17:10:18] <DeltaHeavy> They're a headache
[17:10:26] <jose3_> yes Id like to look at ember and angular
[17:10:31] <jose3_> and all sorts of stuff
[17:10:36] <jose3_> laravel
[17:10:38] <xdevnull> DeltaHeavy, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller
[17:11:03] <DeltaHeavy> xdevnull I know what MVC is. Why are you linking me that?
[17:11:21] <xdevnull> Cuz seems you're missing what MVC means
[17:11:25] <xdevnull> SPA has nothing to do with "MVC".
[17:11:25] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:11:40] <DeltaHeavy> xdevnull I know it doesn't. I'm just saying you shouldn't use "a framework" unless you're doing something complex ~LIKE~ an SPA.
[17:11:45] <DeltaHeavy> SPA being an example of something complex.
[17:11:54] <DeltaHeavy> And not EVERY SPA is complex
[17:12:19] <jose3_> You guys, cant we all just get along and vote for Trump?
[17:12:30] <robertmaxrees> #nope
[17:12:31] <DeltaHeavy> xdevnull Also not all frameworks are MVC.
[17:12:55] <xdevnull> MVC is a design pattern.
[17:13:06] <robertmaxrees> and?
[17:13:12] <robertmaxrees> there are lots of design patterns.
[17:13:17] <robertmaxrees> why are you so stuck on MVC?
[17:13:31] <DeltaHeavy> xdevnull I know. Where did I say MVC before you brought it up anyway?
[17:13:38] <xdevnull> !goal
[17:13:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:13:54] <DeltaHeavy> xdevnull -YOU- seem to not understand that a framework doesn't explicitly refer to something that enforces an MVC architecture.
[17:14:08] <DeltaHeavy> It's one of many opinions a framework can jam down your throat :p
[17:14:19] <xdevnull> DeltaHeavy, Sure... lol
[17:14:27] <DeltaHeavy> ur weird
[17:14:56] <xdevnull> Lol lol loooooool
[17:14:58] <xdevnull> I was missing with the wrong chat channnel
[17:15:09] <xdevnull> sooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyy
[17:15:33] <DeltaHeavy> It's ok :p
[17:16:04] <xdevnull> I'm in #jquery / #laravel channel. so i thought we were talking about "When to use laravel"
[17:16:06] <xdevnull> sorry
[17:16:11] <xdevnull> my bad <3
[17:16:27] <zzaichik> oooooooooh
[17:16:27] <jose3_> How about this question...
[17:16:40] <dddh__> xdevnull: btw what do you prefer as a framework for spa?
[17:17:26] <jose3_> What would you say If I built a site like this: http://www.fortunebuilders.com/ NOT using a framework? good, bad, indifferent, acceptable?
[17:17:44] <xdevnull> dddh__, Ummmhhh. I would go for AngularJS probably
[17:18:06] <taplar> jose3_: i'd say it'd be involved regardless
[17:18:11] <robertmaxrees> is any of that dynamically driven?
[17:18:13] <xdevnull> jose3_ There are reasons when to use framework. I'm not saying don't use framework or use framework.
[17:18:24] <robertmaxrees> because this site isn't really an SPA.
[17:18:37] <jose3_> robertmaxrees:  SOme of it, like event listings and such, but not a lot
[17:18:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not an SPA.
[17:18:48] <snover> that would be a terrible site to use a client-side framework.
[17:18:48] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the concept.
[17:19:01] <jose3_> really?
[17:19:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:19:11] <robertmaxrees> no need for one.
[17:19:16] <jose3_> fair enough
[17:19:31] <robertmaxrees> that's largely static client-side.
[17:19:37] <jose3_> so its appropriate to have like 15 hard coded static pages in this case?
[17:20:07] <taplar> what's wrong with static pages?
[17:20:14] <robertmaxrees> sure.  or just us a basic server-side setup that has a header/footer and then shoves in your content.
[17:20:27] <jose3_> I see- fair enough
[17:21:15] <Sllollaryee> Hello, could anyone help me with setTimeout and setInterval?
[17:21:32] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question :)
[17:21:39] <Sllollaryee> I got a delay set to 500ms
[17:21:39] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[17:21:46] <Sllollaryee> but instead it takes 5 seconds at the very least
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> show your code in a fiddle.
[17:22:10] <Sllollaryee> I will, sec
[17:22:48] <Sllollaryee> http://pastebin.com/8VvFRdte
[17:22:58] <Sllollaryee> This is a pastebin, but it shows what it should do
[17:23:07] <Sllollaryee> I want to reload a text file every 500 ms
[17:23:24] <Sllollaryee> but when I manually edit the text file (for testing purposes) it takes at least 5 seconds for the content to update
[17:23:39] <robertmaxrees> you want to put that timeout in the callback for that load.
[17:27:06] <Sllollaryee> That improved it quite a lot
[17:27:21] <robertmaxrees> because you're actually waiting for the ajax call to finish before firing off the next one,.
[17:27:47] <Sllollaryee> Is there some kind of minimum of interval I should use?
[17:28:04] <taplar> you should cache your #content selector
[17:28:09] <Sllollaryee> I dont know how this affects performance
[17:28:27] <Sllollaryee> you mean assign it to a variable?
[17:28:27] <robertmaxrees> $() is an expensive operation.
[17:28:32] <Sllollaryee> or is it a bit more complicated than that
[17:28:38] <robertmaxrees> reducing it as much as possible is a good thing.
[17:28:52] <Sllollaryee> Thanks for the tip
[17:29:05] <robertmaxrees> and i mean, 500ms is fine?
[17:29:06] <cangelosx1> so you're telling me $($($($($('.foobar'))))) is wrong????
[17:29:09] <cangelosx1>  /s
[17:29:17] <robertmaxrees> no idea what your question is really asking.
[17:29:41] <Sllollaryee> oh
[17:29:47] <Sllollaryee> so I just declare the elements I use
[17:29:48] <taplar> not wrong.  just not the best
[17:30:04] <cangelosx1> taplar: /s
[17:30:10] <robertmaxrees> Sllollaryee basically.  store those in vars before using them.
[17:30:16] <robertmaxrees> before the timeout.
[17:30:21] <Sllollaryee> I did that with the others
[17:30:25] <Sllollaryee> dont know why I didnt do that for this one
[17:30:26] <taplar> wrong implies it either doesn't work or it is morally bad.  it's neither in this case, :P
[17:30:40] <robertmaxrees> right, so do that with content, too :)
[17:30:46] <Sllollaryee> I just did, let me check
[17:31:14] <Sllollaryee> what happens if I put the interval too low?
[17:31:20] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, what did you mean by "Is there some kind of minimum of interval I should use?"
[17:31:23] <Sllollaryee> I want it to be almost realtime
[17:31:31] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[17:31:37] <taplar> your going to run into the delay the browser has for kicking it off
[17:31:46] <taplar> it's not going to be instantaneously
[17:31:55] <robertmaxrees> because depending you should really look into using some kind of push framework instead.
[17:32:20] <Sllollaryee> Im making some kind of basic irc thing
[17:32:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean a chat?
[17:32:32] <Sllollaryee> yes
[17:32:35] <Sllollaryee> just for practice
[17:32:39] <taplar> 500 seems kinda low then
[17:32:41] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, look into a push absed system instead.
[17:32:48] <Sllollaryee> if someone saves a message I want others to see it almost instantly
[17:32:56] <robertmaxrees> right.  so you don't want to use $.ajax()
[17:33:12] <Sllollaryee> My first day in, and I already abused a technology
[17:33:15] <Sllollaryee> lol
[17:33:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:33:20] <taplar> nah
[17:33:27] <robertmaxrees> nah, it's all good.  just about knowing what to use.
[17:34:44] <taplar> the thing about irc and polling, if you go that route, and wanting it to be instant is how important is that?  i mean, they'd only see the delay if they had two users in the room
[17:35:23] <Sllollaryee> True
[17:35:36] <Sllollaryee> I dont want to get into any frameworks to be honest
[17:35:44] <Sllollaryee> this is just to play around with jquery
[17:36:00] <Sllollaryee> nothing too serious
[17:36:04] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[17:36:08] <jose3_> robertmaxrees: I did it!
[17:36:12] <robertmaxrees> jose3_ cool
[17:36:27] <Sllollaryee> thanks for helping me out though
[17:36:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.
[17:45:35] <robertmaxrees> ffs i do python for a few days and already i'm forgetting semicolons.
[17:48:40] <cannap> lol
[17:48:56] <thinkxl_> robertmaxrees that happens to me a lot
[17:49:10] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:49:19] <cannap> np i use var in php
[17:49:34] <taplar> i got to watch awkwardCough play around in java after living it groovy world.  all kinds of fun
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:49:40] <thinkxl> brackets will be next
[17:50:00] <robertmaxrees> i wrote a microservice recently in python and it took me a little while to get my fingers to not be dumb.
[17:58:42] <thinkxl> list comprehensions are like write plain english on python
[17:59:16] <thinkxl> [result for results in data if data < 5]
[17:59:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:01:36] <GreatDanton> I am fetching data from openweather map api, but sometimes I receive 429 response. What is the best way to rewrite triple getJson [line 34-44] so that 'bug' wont happen again? https://github.com/GreatDanton/Weather-Forecast/blob/master/js.js
[18:02:13] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[18:02:31] <robertmaxrees> well, that means you're hitting their service too much.
[18:02:38] <robertmaxrees> and they're trying to limit you.
[18:03:27] <GreatDanton> well yes, but sometimes I am able to make all 3 calls, and sometimes I am not
[18:03:31] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:03:48] <robertmaxrees> because sometimes you're not hitting their rate limiter, and other times you aren't.
[18:04:01] <robertmaxrees> err, and other times you ARE, rather.
[18:05:01] <robertmaxrees> like, you can't avoid that without just calling the API less.
[18:06:01] <GreatDanton> hmm, I am not sure If I can get the desired data in only 2 calls :[
[18:06:17] <robertmaxrees> are you hitting refresh on the page a ton?
[18:06:41] <GreatDanton> not really, I just open it once per day
[18:07:06] <GreatDanton> you can test it live: http://greatdanton.github.io/Weather-Forecast/
[18:07:58] <robertmaxrees> working fine here.
[18:08:18] <robertmaxrees> http://openweathermap.org/price - no more than 60 calls per minute.
[18:08:23] <GreatDanton> yes like I said, sometimes it works, sometimes one part of data doesn't show up
[18:08:31] <robertmaxrees> depending on how they define that, you're at their mercy.
[18:08:33] <robertmaxrees> you cannot work around this.
[18:08:36] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[18:08:46] <robertmaxrees> unless you rate limit yourself somehow.
[18:10:46] <GreatDanton> ah okay, I will try to rewrite that to 2 calls only
[18:10:52] <GreatDanton> thanks robertmaxrees
[18:48:32] <merkazu> hello, a quick response would be appreciated, if I'm binding two events to the same element, one via $(element).click() and $(static).on('click', 'element', function(){}), is the fact that i'm doing this why the second one doesn't fire?
[18:49:04] <merkazu> (working around some legacy code right now, in place refactoring is failing for some reason)
[18:49:07] <robertmaxrees> that really depends.
[18:49:19] <robertmaxrees> is either one of those preventing the event from bubbling?
[18:51:04] <merkazu> would the callback in the first part returning false cause that?
[18:51:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:51:15] <merkazu> friggin
[18:51:46] <merkazu> that thing cost me a good two hours because of having to revert a deploy
[18:52:42] <merkazu> so i guess i need to either embed the contents of the on('click') into the callback or figure out why the callback is returning false in the first place
[18:52:52] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:56:02] <cagmz> a textbox within a div with a given id? like:  $("#contactWidget_panel :containsExcludeChildren(Add New Entry)");
[18:56:08] <cagmz> *how do I select
[18:56:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:57:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean the input type?
[18:57:15] <cagmz> sorry, nevermind
[18:57:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:57:21] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[19:06:08] <z1haze> I have a strange issue, I have an ajax response returning a 200, yet its hitting the .fail() block instead of .done() ?
[19:06:19] <robertmaxrees> invalid formats can cause that.
[19:07:35] <z1haze> hmm
[19:08:12] <z1haze> here's a snippet i pulled from my function http://dpaste.com/3K9HJ0Z
[19:08:19] <z1haze> should have whats needed
[19:08:25] <robertmaxrees> right, that's not the problem.
[19:08:30] <arc_> he means invalid json format
[19:08:31] <robertmaxrees> the issue is the data you're getting back from your server.
[19:08:56] <z1haze> alright
[19:09:07] <arc_> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsejson/
[19:09:16] <arc_> this has a list of potential causes
[19:09:27] <z1haze> just is strange because i have like 10 other ajax calls in this switch statement all basically doing the same thing, yet this is the only one that breaks
[19:09:44] <robertmaxrees> then that's the only one that's got an invalid response.
[19:10:23] <z1haze> yea it just didnt seem to like me having a $ in it
[19:11:02] <robertmaxrees> in your json?
[19:11:04] <z1haze> removing the $ from the return and having it just return an integer gives no error
[19:11:04] <z1haze> yea
[19:11:12] <robertmaxrees> show us what you mean.
[19:12:03] <z1haze> well i just return the integer, i believe my framework automatically converts to json anytime you return raw data, but before i was returning a '$' . $some_number but i removed the '$' . and it gives no error now
[19:12:20] <robertmaxrees> what does the return data look like?
[19:13:01] <z1haze> just an integer
[19:13:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:13:19] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you won't just show an example, but ok :)
[19:13:34] <z1haze> haha im sorry theres literally just nothing to show
[19:14:06] <z1haze> here robertmaxrees https://gyazo.com/ed3c9563fd3e6f442d3728f14e532544
[19:14:23] <z1haze> removin the $ from my response fixed it
[19:16:02] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[19:16:04] <robertmaxrees> $0 is not valid json
[19:16:13] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything, in fact.
[19:16:30] <z1haze> yea, but returning a number on its own, has no problem
[19:16:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:16:45] <robertmaxrees> because that's a legit value.
[19:17:04] <z1haze> so a number thats not wrapped in json { } stuff is fine, but a string wouldnt be?
[19:17:05] <robertmaxrees> though that's not technically JSON, jquery can figure out wtf you want.
[19:17:11] <z1haze> i gotcha
[19:17:11] <robertmaxrees> $0 isn't a string.
[19:17:15] <robertmaxrees> '$0' is.
[19:17:28] <z1haze> well its something xD
[19:17:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:18:28] <spoonUltra> If anyone's interested, I'm trying to figure out why clicking Test doesn't scroll down to Scroll to here. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Kzmzyj
[19:19:06] <robertmaxrees> $($(this).attr('href')) isn't what you think it is there.
[19:19:49] <spoonUltra> hmm
[19:20:17] <robertmaxrees> also: your logo div is covering those elements.
[19:20:59] <spoonUltra> snap!
[19:22:02] <robertmaxrees> grab the offset before the animate call and use that instead.
[19:24:46] <spoonUltra> robertmaxrees thanks
[19:24:59] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[19:39:23] <taplar> is there a way with jqm to get the zoom ratio?
[19:43:21] <robertmaxrees> spoonUltra just ask in here, yo.
[19:43:41] <spoonUltra> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Kzmzyj
[19:43:46] <robertmaxrees> and open your console.
[19:43:51] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to see the problem :)
[19:43:59] <robertmaxrees> $(this).attr('href').offset().top isn't what you think it is.
[19:44:26] <robertmaxrees> and you don't declare a $d anywehre.
[19:44:35] <decx> hehe
[19:44:41] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:45:02] <spoonUltra> cool
[19:46:23] <robertmaxrees> also: you're repeating IDs on the page.
[19:46:25] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[19:50:16] <spoonUltra> wow, I totally missed that
[19:51:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:12:45] <z1haze> can someone explain how the server-side ajax with datatables works?
[20:15:02] <z1haze> the examples aren't so hot..
[20:28:03] <Sllollaryee> Is this line legit code?
[20:28:05] <Sllollaryee>     document.load("sources/post.php");
[20:29:00] <DeltaHeavy> Sllollaryee Don't think so.
[20:29:09] <Sllollaryee> FeelsBadMan
[20:29:27] <Sllollaryee> I just need some php code to execute on pressing a button
[20:29:53] <DeltaHeavy> Sllollaryee What browsers do you need to support? Is your front end already using jQuery?
[20:30:04] <Sllollaryee> Yes
[20:30:10] <Sllollaryee> Im doing some questionable stuff right now
[20:30:21] <DeltaHeavy> What browsers do you need ot support?
[20:30:32] <DeltaHeavy> Oh wait nvm
[20:30:42] <DeltaHeavy> Fetch API isn't as well supported as I thought.
[20:30:57] <DeltaHeavy> You'll probably want this - http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[20:31:26] <DeltaHeavy> $('.my-button').on('click', function () { $.ajax(...); });
[20:38:25] <bobdobbs`> just checking: if I'm crafting an http request using $.ajax, I can define http headers, right?
[20:40:05] <Sllollaryee> I got a temporary fix
[20:40:20] <Sllollaryee> I wanted to handle a form and load that PHP in as I pressed the submit button
[20:40:33] <Sllollaryee> without reloading the entire page
[20:40:46] <Sllollaryee> for now it handles the form on a different page and redirects back when its done
[20:41:05] <shoky> bobdobbs` yea
[20:41:34] <bobdobbs`> shoky: thanks
[20:54:35] <Sllollaryee> Does anyone know how a site like this was made? https://passphrase.io/
[20:54:51] <Sllollaryee> like what technologies? Just JS and NodeJS or something?
[20:58:50] <paul_> Sllollaryee, what's your passphrase ?
[20:59:06] <Sllollaryee> I dont have one
[20:59:14] <Sllollaryee> I was just wondering how the site itself was made
[20:59:29] <Sllollaryee> It says he used client side JS for encryption and that kind of stuff
[20:59:29] <paul_> what are you most curious about ?
[20:59:43] <paul_> https
[20:59:51] <Sllollaryee> how things get saved
[20:59:59] <paul_> looking
[21:01:37] <paul_> Sllollaryee, it's just javascript
[21:01:49] <paul_> it's not a difficult site to understand.
[21:04:47] <paul_> Sllollaryee,  so client takes the passphrase and encrypts the message.   The client takes the SHA256 hash of your passphrase.  both the encrypted message and SHA256 get saved.
[21:05:04] <Sllollaryee> But how do they get saved
[21:05:09] <Sllollaryee> can you do that with just javascript?
[21:05:22] <Sllollaryee> I use PHP to store data
[21:05:26] <Sllollaryee> like a pleb
[21:05:36] <paul_> Sllollaryee, I don't know pleb
[21:05:55] <Sllollaryee> like a newb
[21:05:55] <paul_> probably in a database, but you shouldn't care.  it could be stored on the file system
[21:08:02] <Sllollaryee> so it could be stored in regular text files?
[21:08:16] <Sllollaryee> I googled a bit to see if there was a way to do that
[21:08:25] <Sllollaryee> and it basically told me you need additional libraries or something
[21:08:28] <paul_> Sllollaryee, absolutely
[21:08:40] <Sllollaryee> Im kinda new
[21:08:49] <Sllollaryee> I dont want to get into libraries too quickly
[21:09:01] <paul_> you need libraries because you use PHP
[21:09:38] <paul_> Sllollaryee, it should be very easy to do in a database as well
[21:10:03] <Sllollaryee> I never said I was any good at php :P
[21:10:13] <Sllollaryee> I do know how to use a database, kinda
[21:10:20] <Sllollaryee> but I dont like them very much
[21:10:52] <paul_> Sllollaryee, they'll suck the life out of you ;)
[21:11:51] <Sllollaryee> what
[21:19:17] <z1haze> anyone know if theres a way to insert a default value for a datatable column? for example I want to show a user's role, but if they dont have a role then just show a default text
[21:29:14] <paul_> z1haze, probably have to do that on-the-fly  but you could likely craft something like a change event
[21:30:15] <z1haze> paul_, I actally found a property to set a default value, but now im trying to figure out how to insert an image with the data returned.. ie i have their email and I want to show a gravatar
[21:31:40] <z1haze> il tackle it though, im sure its possible somehow
[21:45:35] <jose3_> Is there such a library....
[21:46:37] <jose3_> that is easy to plugin in to a input box- that will predict the input
[21:52:09] <jose3_> Better Question... I just found Jquery UI's  Autocomplete. How would i hook this up to a db so that I can have autocomplete functionality?
[21:58:55] <Sllollaryee> Im not sure if Im even allowed to link to w3schools
[21:58:56] <Sllollaryee> http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_php.asp
[21:59:07] <Sllollaryee> but the first example is what you basically want
[21:59:17] <Sllollaryee> but then with a db
[21:59:35] <Sllollaryee> you will definitely need AJAX I think
[22:01:38] <Sllollaryee> and to make a connection with a db you need a back-end language
[22:01:44] <Sllollaryee> as far as I know
[22:01:53] <Sllollaryee> like PHP or NodeJS
[22:02:09] <Sllollaryee> but perhaps theres some magic library that can help you, I do not know
[22:38:11] <jose3_> I see
[22:38:19] <jose3_> I guess I was hoping more magic
[22:38:35] <jose3_> Basically with a db supplied to me
[22:39:13] <Sllollaryee> Im not an expert either, perhaps someone else can help you out more
[23:34:27] <Enerel> albedoa can you help
