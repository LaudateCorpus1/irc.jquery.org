[00:47:28] <kromwell> I'm trying to create a form with javascript, and grab the inputs
[00:47:44] <kromwell> but when I capture the input on sumbit, I cant access any of the properties
[00:48:30] <kromwell> https://jsfiddle.net/ajL4t27q/1/
[00:48:31] <kromwell> Oops

[00:56:47] <the133448> Hi could anyone help me with this, http://codepen.io/the133448/pen/KrkqzO/
[00:56:57] <the133448> I want the smooth animations from row to row
[00:57:01] <the133448> not just for the same row
[00:57:07] <the133448> try pressing the buttons to see how it works
[01:26:39] <nopea> anybody here have any idea why I am getting the error 'Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined' when jQuery is loaded and the script still works?
[03:43:48] <viewty_> How do I pass the id used in an if to a function if it passes? e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/aqjnyvbj/ I'm doing the same thing each time, so I change '//do stuff' to a function, how do I give it the id?
[04:02:33] <cavac> Seems download.jqueryui.com is down. Getting "504 gateway time-out" errors from CloudFlare.
[04:06:48] <cavac> Any idea when download.jqueryui.com will be available again?
[04:34:54] <Cork> cavac: you could download from code.jquery.com/ui
[04:37:26] <Cork> viewty_: https://jsfiddle.net/aqjnyvbj/1/
[04:47:35] <viewty_> Thanks Cork
[04:48:31] <viewty_> within doStuff 'this' would be the #id that called it?
[04:49:18] <Cork> viewty_: same as any jquery plugin
[04:49:27] <viewty_> ok
[04:49:36] <Cork> target is the element matching the id and the class
[04:49:43] <Cork> so you could just run the code right there
[04:50:13] <Cork> or do an if(target.attr('id') == 'something') {} if you need to special case something
[05:25:38] <jaskaran> Hello
[05:25:57] <jaskaran> i am using jQuery Datepicker in my application
[05:26:24] <jaskaran> i want to display Months instead of dates in the tiles
[05:27:05] <jaskaran> instead of the dates ... Month names are to be displayed
[05:27:48] <jaskaran> pls suggest some help
[05:36:22] <Cork> jaskaran: https://jsfiddle.net/gn4g2u9L/
[05:37:12] <Cork> jaskaran: if you actually want a year grid you will have to use another plugin
[05:39:27] <Cork> something like ex. https://demos.shieldui.com/web/monthyearpicker/gridintegration
[06:15:18] <Azrael_-> hi
[06:16:37] <Azrael_-> i want to change the submitted data of a form while being in the form.onClick-event. currently the sent data is still the data at the time the click being sent.
[06:16:46] <Azrael_-> is there a way to accomplish this?
[06:55:56] <codecutter> Are there any good js sort libs out there?
[07:52:59] <aiena> I am totally new to AJAX still trying to wrap my head around it. I used Jquery's ajax feature. It seems to work as in I do get a response from pmy php and it show up in the div. But the page temporarily reloads itself entirely. Other websites AJax is flicker free. Also the call to the php does not show up in the network tab of the browser
[07:53:24] <aiena> is that expected
[07:54:38] <aiena> just making a jsfiddle hold on
[08:06:03] <aiena> https://jsfiddle.net/fn6bskhw/1/ this fiddle works but I am trying to understand hoe tp prevent the ajax request from running on a default form without user input
[08:06:10] <aiena> how to prevent
[08:07:05] <MikeD_> i'm looking for feedback on which way to do something similar to this:  https://jsfiddle.net/jqdgs7yn/
[08:10:49] <MikeD_> ok, so it's too early for anyone to be awake yet  :)
[08:12:12] <aiena> hmm I guess so
[08:13:10] <jarco_> Hello, I am looking at some code I do not understand, someone has written doActionHere: function(- {//dostuff} . what does this do exactly?
[08:20:01] <jarco_> nvm got it
[08:30:43] <cannap> @aiena https://jsfiddle.net/fn6bskhw/3/
[08:45:34] <Cork> jarco_: you mean like { key: function(- {} } ?
[08:45:42] <Cork> that doesn't parse so...
[08:46:16] <Cork> jarco_: if you mean { key: function() {} } its a callback function
[08:47:40] <Cork> MikeD_: i would use a class and handle it in one event handle instead
[08:48:16] <Cork> something like $('#parent').on('click', '.class', function() { if(this.id == '') {} });
[08:48:33] <Cork> depending on how shared the code is
[08:48:43] <Cork> (the switch option is an alternative too
[08:48:55] <Cork> though you don't need to go over jquery to grab it
[08:48:59] <MikeD_> yeah, the oversimplified example doesn't illustrate real code perfectly
[08:49:09] <Cork> btw $(evt.target).attr('id') is not safe
[08:49:23] <Cork> it is any element that you happened to click on
[08:49:38] <MikeD_> but yeah, my first thought was to have a single handler... the person i'm working with thought delegated one for each
[08:49:50] <MikeD_> but I was curious if there is any internal functional difference
[08:49:58] <Cork> yes it is a big difference
[08:50:11] <Cork> if you bind multiple delegated event handlers you will get one event handler for each one
[08:50:15] <Cork> and that slows down the dom
[08:50:31] <Cork> you want to use one event handler for shared actions if possible
[08:51:39] <Cork> so the second last option is actually the worst one
[08:51:55] <Cork> as it will execute three event handlers on parent for any click inside it
[08:52:12] <Cork> while the last option only executes one if that specific element was clicked
[08:52:23] <Cork> though the browser has to loop over all of them to check if they match
[08:52:30] <MikeD_> that's what I thought, thank you for corroborating... i wasn't sure how to google that
[08:52:35] <Cork> so the cost for the browser for the last and second last is the same
[08:53:12] <Cork> what i would recommend is to use delegate with a class for the elements you care about
[08:53:18] <Cork> and then a switch case for this.id
[08:54:00] <Cork> depending on how many other children you have that is though
[08:54:35] <Cork> MikeD_: this is also a far option https://jsfiddle.net/jqdgs7yn/1/
[08:54:54] <dwebber88> having a rather strange problem overriding a jquery plugin. See here duplicate value in the second example, where i want the behaviour of the first example https://jsfiddle.net/qmw9g4d0/
[08:55:16] <dwebber88> someone please tell me i'm making a stupid mistake :)
[08:59:15] <Cork> dwebber88: are you trying to set defaults for the plugin?
[08:59:25] <Cork> i'm getting kinda confused what you're trying to do
[08:59:44] <dwebber88> yes setting defaults for the plugin
[08:59:58] <dwebber88> and then calling it without having to set those options everytime
[09:00:05] <Cork> dwebber88: and how exactly would that work with daterangepicker.apply(this, arguments); ?
[09:00:12] <Cork> :)
[09:00:36] <dwebber88> i change settings to defaults and it works
[09:00:36] <Cork> i suspect what you meant to use was daterangepicker.call(this, settings)
[09:01:27] <dwebber88> it was about seperator not merging. but after 15 minutes, i now discovered i made a typo in separator :')
[09:01:32] <dwebber88> problem solved, thanks
[09:01:54] <Cork> dwebber88: also you haven't defined settings in that scope
[09:01:57] <Cork> so it becomes global
[09:02:01] <Cork> you prob want to avoid that
[09:02:42] <Cork> so https://jsfiddle.net/qmw9g4d0/1/
[09:03:07] <dwebber88> yes, so i came up with this: https://jsfiddle.net/qmw9g4d0/2/
[09:03:39] <Cork> dwebber88: you're kinda confusing how $.extend works
[09:03:50] <Cork> if you want to update defaults just remove {},
[09:04:06] <Cork> currently you merge defaults and options into a new object and set it to settings
[09:04:11] <Cork> then you never use it
[09:04:34] <dwebber88> its used by arguments (i changed it to "defaults"
[09:04:37] <Cork> and now you merge defaults and options into a new object, and replace the object in defaults
[09:05:27] <Cork> same thing https://jsfiddle.net/qmw9g4d0/4/
[09:06:04] <dwebber88> aaah. yes you're right
[09:06:18] <dwebber88> i got it confused with the many variations i tried when getting desperate
[09:06:25] <dwebber88> glad to say it works perfectly now :)
[09:06:26] <Cork> but this happens cause of object references
[09:06:38] <Cork> what you should do is stop using arguments
[09:06:54] <Cork> as it is quite obscure why it works
[09:07:07] <dwebber88> so .apply(this, defaults) ?
[09:07:17] <Cork> no .call(this, defaults)
[09:07:29] <Cork> apply expects an array of arguments
[09:07:42] <Cork> .call takes the arguments directly
[09:09:20] <Cork> dwebber88: i would also recommend writing it as this https://jsfiddle.net/qmw9g4d0/5/
[09:09:37] <Cork> then you preserv the original behavior of the function
[09:10:10] <Cork> as $().daterangepicker().data() or what ever will still work
[09:11:01] <dwebber88> ah! good point
[09:11:05] <dwebber88> thank you so much
[09:11:11] <Cork> np
[09:11:11] <dwebber88> i'm very grateful for this
[09:32:21] <marc_v92> I'm running into a very strange issue that I've never experienced before, I'll try to explain it as best I can:
[09:32:45] <marc_v92> It almost seems like jQuery is being instantiated twice, but I've triple-checked my code, and I only include jQuery once.
[09:32:55] <marc_v92> What I mean is, all of my listeners fire twice.
[09:33:32] <marc_v92> If I have $("#MyForm").on('submit'), and I submit the form, that function fires twice, one after the other.
[09:34:01] <marc_v92> Not only that, but if I do something like... $(".feed-item").on("click", function(this){ console.log(this) });
[09:34:22] <marc_v92> The console logs the wrong element. It logs the .feed-item below the one I just clicked.
[09:35:04] <marc_v92> I'm not sure where I would start debugging this. What could be some potential causes for me to look for?
[09:52:49] <taplar> marc_v92: if the binding is firing twice it could be that whatever method you are running to do the binding is running twice
[09:53:28] <taplar> including jquery multiple times would not affect that at all, as jQuery doesn't be default do binding on your elements.
[09:53:35] <taplar> be=by
[09:54:38] <taplar> also $(".feed-item").on("click", function(this){ console.log(this) });
[09:54:41] <taplar> don't pass in this
[09:55:03] <taplar> the first argument of an event handler is the event
[09:57:26] <cannap> this is always in a event the context from the clicked or the emitter
[09:58:09] <cannap> when you need the context arround you can use => arrow functions or .bind(this)
[09:58:16] <Cork> this is always sat in a member function rather
[09:58:36] <Cork> cannap: fat arrow isn't really usable yet though
[09:58:46] <Cork> it isn't cross browser safe to use yet
[09:58:48] <cannap> ah i mean es6
[09:58:57] <Cork> es6 isn't safe to use yet :)
[09:58:59] <cannap> babel^^ transpile
[09:59:08] <taplar> i avoid fat arrow for now.  and just from seeing people go crazy with it, i'll probably limit my use of it with map
[09:59:29] <cannap> i like const bla  = () => { }
[09:59:43] <cannap> i use this for events also in es6
[09:59:48] <Cork> sure i like it too, but if i need to pre compile my js before sending it off then i won't use it
[09:59:51] <cannap> to get the this from you know^^
[10:00:01] <Cork> so i use it a lot in extensions, but not on the web; yet
[10:00:13] <cannap> webpack^^
[10:00:19] <cannap> npm run build done
[10:00:28] <Cork> and that goes back to my original comment
[10:00:33] <Cork> "but if i need to pre compile my js before sending it off then i won't use it"
[10:00:48] <cannap> hm k
[10:00:53] <Cork> i want to write exactly what is served to the user (with exception for spaces and line breaks)
[10:01:17] <Cork> i detest things like coffiescript
[10:08:37] <taplar_brb> i love coffee though
[10:35:57] <naftilos76> is there a way to get the real height of $(window) which would be the visible website area height + scroll bar offset ?
[10:38:46] <taplar> does clientHeight not include the scrollbar?
[11:11:58] <Dan39> oo topic how i love you :D
[11:14:44] <Dan39> finally i find some explanations of the $ thing. i feel like its more confusing than if you decided to use even something like $jq instead of just $
[11:23:18] <taplar> ?
[11:28:17] <nopea> anybody have a clue as to why I am getting an 'Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined' error, yet jquery is loaded and the script actually does what it supposed to (i.e works).
[11:33:18] <taplar> can you recreate it in a fiddle?
[11:36:55] <nopea> taplar: I dont think so as I am using Gravity Forms (gform_confirmation_loaded) with the script.
[12:10:42] <jose3_> @systemfault: Iv'e never seen this syntax before
[12:10:47] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/R2s3L57G/
[12:11:08] <robertmaxrees> which part are you lost on?
[12:11:36] <jose3_> if (c == 0 || c == leds.length - 1) d = -d;
[12:11:44] <jose3_> there is no use of {}
[12:12:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can omit the curlies from if statements, though most people opt to keep them in because it's easier to read.
[12:12:19] <robertmaxrees> if (c == 0 || c == leds.length - 1) { d = -d; } - it translates to this.
[12:12:19] <jose3_> okay  I see
[12:12:31] <jose3_> so c+=d is outside of the brackets then ?
[12:12:58] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:13:18] <robertmaxrees> what is this code trying to do?
[12:13:19] <jose3_> so it is the same as :
[12:13:25] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/PgcsnT8B/
[12:13:34] <jose3_> its for the tessel2
[12:14:01] <jose3_> I was following a tutorial and wasnt sure if it was some kind of propietary code or if it was just unrecognized vanilla js
[12:14:28] <robertmaxrees> ah.  i would rething the wa this is built - for loops should generally be avoided imo.
[12:15:22] <jose3_> @robertmaxrees
[12:15:26] <jose3_> thanks for clearing that up for me
[12:15:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you don't have to include the @ :)
[12:16:46] <jose3_> oh heh thanks
[12:17:33] <jose3_> what is d = -d ?
[12:17:37] <jose3_> d = d-- ?
[12:17:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:17:57] <jose3_> negative of whatever d is ?
[12:18:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.  one sec.
[12:18:07] <robertmaxrees> easy way to find out ;)
[12:20:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see this code with more context fwiw.
[12:21:00] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, wait, does this toggle all things that are "on" to "off" and vice versa?
[12:21:14] <jose3_> yes!
[12:21:32] <jose3_> the variables are just numbers 0 and 1 I think
[12:21:38] <jose3_> I don't actually have the code with me
[12:21:38] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty gross.
[12:21:43] <jose3_> lol
[12:21:52] <jose3_> I didn't write it, not that mine would be any better
[12:22:06] <robertmaxrees> there are tons of ways to do this with much clearer code.
[12:22:11] <jose3_> but basically ther are four leds and the lights go back and forth like in the car from nightrider
[12:22:30] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, a sort of "bounce" effect from left to right?
[12:22:51] <jose3_> yes sir
[12:23:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, lots of clearer ways to accomplish that.
[12:23:38] <jose3_> ok I thought so myself, but i didnt really question it because I consider him more knowledgeable myself
[12:24:08] <jose3_> i was just like, this must be how things are done on this thing
[12:24:17] <robertmaxrees> as a general rule of thumb, you never want to use single-char var names.  or really short ones.
[12:24:21] <robertmaxrees> make 'em descriptive.
[12:24:39] <jose3_> Its for this thing : http://johnny-five.io/news/tessel-2-chipkit-uno32-sparkfun-edison-arduino-block/
[12:24:41] <robertmaxrees> also: naming them things like "int" is never really helpful - i can tell it's a number.  what's it the nuymber of?
[12:25:10] <jose3_> okay
[12:25:12] <jose3_> thanks!
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> SO glad it's friday.
[13:02:47] <Gsham> hello all. i have a click event that doesnt stop default but its suppose to add an icon to the button. works in all but safari which just skips the adding
[13:02:50] <Gsham> of the class
[13:03:01] <robertmaxrees> Gsham show us your code?
[13:03:14] <Gsham> saltnpixels.com click hire me on front page in safari
[13:03:17] <Gsham> then click in chrome
[13:03:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:03:39] <robertmaxrees> care to make a standalone test case so I don't have to hunt around your page source?
[13:03:46] <Gsham> yes ok
[13:03:53] <robertmaxrees> :) tjhanks.
[13:05:51] <Gsham> working on it...
[13:05:58] <Gsham> :)
[13:06:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:06:37] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't take much.
[13:06:43] <robertmaxrees> event binding and a little markup..
[13:07:18] <Gsham> http://codepen.io/saltnpixels/pen/rLpvXK
[13:07:31] <Gsham> now it wokrs if the links doenst go anywhere but if it does it doesnt work
[13:08:31] <robertmaxrees> are there any other handlers bound to these?
[13:09:34] <Gsham> no
[13:09:35] <robertmaxrees> also, fun fact, if you're not going to use the event object, you shouldn't pass it to the handler.
[13:10:09] <robertmaxrees> and ah - so if the href="#" it does what you want, but if the href="anyotherpage" it doesn't work?
[13:10:28] <Gsham> in safari correct
[13:10:32] <Gsham> unless i set preventdefualt
[13:10:35] <Gsham> but i dont want that
[13:10:48] <robertmaxrees> that's to be expected. in fact, i wouldn't expect it to work in any browser tbh.
[13:12:05] <Gsham> maybe i should use settimeout
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:12:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:12:12] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrinle idea.
[13:12:19] <Gsham> the class is being added but not animating
[13:12:28] <robertmaxrees> right.  you want your pages to load as quickly as possible.
[13:12:44] <Gsham> i mean if it would go to the next page really fast i wouldnt care but sometimes it takes a second and the visual was nice
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't worry about it.
[13:12:58] <Gsham> but i am
[13:13:00] <Gsham> :)
[13:13:00] <robertmaxrees> users know how to use web pages :)
[13:13:03] <Gsham> major anxiety here
[13:13:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:13:13] <Gsham> no im a front end developer. THEY DONT
[13:13:24] <robertmaxrees> you're solving a problem you aren't having yet ;)
[13:13:32] <Gsham> oh well.... i... grr
[13:13:44] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, thx for all the help the other day
[13:13:46] <robertmaxrees> heh, trust me.  spend your time and effort on anything else.
[13:14:00] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain absolutely.  glad i could help!
[13:14:31] <AcidRain> i have ascended to a new level
[13:14:54] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:15:25] <AcidRain> im almost worthy of being addressed as Mr. Rain. one day i hope to be equal to sir robert
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:16:06] <taplar> hope you never are golden
[13:16:28] <AcidRain> lol
[13:16:31] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[13:16:46] <taplar> though i await the prince tribute day
[13:17:49] <AcidRain> im wondering how many more rain puns u have lol
[13:18:23] <robertmaxrees> he might be feeling a little foggy right now.
[13:18:30] <robertmaxrees> thoughts could be clouded with other stuff.
[13:19:01] <robertmaxrees> or maybe he's flooded with emotions and just can't event right now.
[13:22:14] <taplar> lol
[13:22:29] <taplar> i have a small break from my many jasmine tests.  i have to make yokes
[13:22:43] <robertmaxrees> water you talking about?
[13:23:47] <taplar> you never appreciate stop lights until they are flashing
[13:24:24] <taplar> other than that was a bad drive home
[14:02:45] <kspr1> i
[14:02:49] <robertmaxrees> j
[14:02:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:03:32] <taplar> k is for cookie, that's good enough for me
[14:04:11] <kspr1> i'm using .blur() to establish when a field is unfocused but if the window isn't visible (example if a user switch tabs), the event is triggered which is behaviour i don't want....
[14:05:31] <taplar> so your expecting if they change tabs and come back for the same field to still be focused?
[14:06:09] <kspr1> taplar: it is still focused but the event is triggered
[14:06:10] <taplar> hmm, that seems to be true in ff
[14:06:15] <taplar> weird
[14:07:55] <robertmaxrees> the element still technically lost focus.
[14:07:56] <taplar> and your blur is on your element, right?
[14:08:57] <kspr1> yes the blur handler is on the input element
[14:09:05] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/35250682
[14:09:08] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this.
[14:10:02] <taplar> interesting, so it fires blur but is still marked as the activeElement
[14:10:16] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:10:22] <robertmaxrees> because it technically lost focus :)
[14:10:45] <taplar> sure.  i was going to suggest possibly checking if the window still was in focus, but that's much cleaner, :D
[14:10:50] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:10:52] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[14:11:36] <kspr1> robertmaxrees: yes technically it does lose focus but it's weird that not more people want the functionality i'm looking for, i'll try implementing this stack overflow answer, thanks
[14:11:58] <taplar> i don't really do blur stuff a lot
[14:12:05] <robertmaxrees> "it's weird that not more people want the functionality i'm looking for" - hrm?
[14:12:17] <kspr1> what?
[14:12:51] <robertmaxrees> guess i'm confused what you mean by that :)
[14:13:01] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for a new event?
[14:14:17] <kspr1> there just seems to be a lack of questions on the interwebs pertaining to this, i thought more people would want the behaviour i'm looking for (input focus event not triggering on window unfocus)
[14:15:02] <robertmaxrees> for most handlers it should matter if it loses focus due to the tab/application being switched.  what is your handler doing?
[14:15:03] <taplar> what are you doing on blur?
[14:15:09] <robertmaxrees> :D
[14:15:37] <taplar> cause if its inside a form and your relying on blur for some sort of validation or something, the user could always hit enter to submit the form, and your validation would not happen
[14:15:57] <taplar> provided it's a vanilla form
[14:16:47] <kspr1> taplar: its for ux not validation
[14:17:02] <robertmaxrees> what's the UX?
[14:17:10] <kspr1> a nice one
[14:17:14] <kspr1> thanks for the help
[14:17:15] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:17:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:17:19] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[14:17:20] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:26:23] <arc_> i use a password manager so i frequently alt tab and find that the password form is highlighted in red or it says "you must enter a password"
[14:26:49] <arc_> but i guess the intersection of people who would have that problem and people who wouldn't understand it's just unintended behavior that doesn't really matter is extremely small
[14:32:26] <taplar> i never save my password
[14:32:45] <taplar> *s
[14:36:04] <arc_> taplar i assume you mean in your browser
[14:36:06] <arc_> that's not what i'm talking about
[14:36:11] <taplar> ah
[14:49:44] <taplar> sloooooooooow
[14:52:12] <taplar> i was very disappointed in myself driving home yesterday.  i realized i referred to shoky as my humidity pal.  when i should have said humidity hommie
[14:58:23] <robertmaxrees> FOR SHAME TAPPY
[14:58:35] <taplar> ik, i failed life
[14:58:39] <robertmaxrees> :(
[15:51:09] <VectorX> i got this snippet applied to a element, using the chrome dev tools how can i modify the values of https://jsfiddle.net/7fxu185r/  .stellar()
[15:54:01] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[15:54:33] <VectorX> ok
[15:58:21] <Forbidd3n> Does jQuery have a method that converts [{key: value},{key: value},{key: value}] to JSON to post with AJAX?
[15:58:37] <taplar> you can use JSON.stringify
[15:59:00] <Forbidd3n> taplar: so jQuery doesn't have anything built in?
[15:59:00] <taplar> but i'm sure there's an inverse of $.parseJSON
[15:59:14] <taplar> serializeArray?
[15:59:49] <Forbidd3n> is serializeArray JSON?
[16:00:19] <taplar> one sec, that's not quite it
[16:01:43] <taplar> i'm not finding it.  so maybe not
[16:01:51] <robertmaxrees> waiit.
[16:01:57] <robertmaxrees> that technically IS JSON.
[16:02:02] <robertmaxrees> so i'm lost about what you need.
[16:02:12] <taplar> thought he was wanting to turn it into a json string
[16:02:28] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: this is an array of objects - [{key: value},{key: value},{key: value}] - this is already json?
[16:02:32] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:02:46] <Forbidd3n> so I can pass that via ajax post
[16:03:08] <robertmaxrees> yep
[16:03:29] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: it doesn't parse here - http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/
[16:03:52] <taplar> ajax will turn it into the parameter or body string it needs
[16:04:34] <robertmaxrees> per http://www.json.org/, squares are valid
[16:04:51] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got?
[16:04:54] <robertmaxrees> that isn't validating.
[16:07:53] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: If I console.log my array of objects I get this -
[16:07:55] <Forbidd3n>  [Object { question="Q1",  score="1"}, Object { question="Q2",  score="4"}, Object { question="Q3",  score="2"}, Object { question="Q4",  score="1"}, Object { question="Q5",  score="5"}]
[16:08:06] <robertmaxrees> that;s not a valid object regardless
[16:08:08] <Forbidd3n> I know that won't parse
[16:08:19] <Forbidd3n> that is in firebug, I know
[16:08:31] <Forbidd3n> what would I use to get it to a string so I can validate it?
[16:08:34] <robertmaxrees> JSON.stringify(theObject)
[16:08:46] <Forbidd3n> ok so I need a 3rd party script then
[16:08:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:08:52] <robertmaxrees> JSON is builting.
[16:08:57] <robertmaxrees> *builtin
[16:09:04] <Forbidd3n> in modern browsers, not legacy ones, correct?
[16:09:25] <robertmaxrees> back up - are you validating the object or doing something else right now?
[16:09:30] <Ziberius> hello
[16:09:36] <robertmaxrees> and JSON.stringify works back to ie8
[16:10:01] <Ziberius> i have a $(".class").change() function
[16:10:02] <cannap> JSON(data,null,2)
[16:10:14] <Ziberius> how can I get the text of the selected option with $(this) ?
[16:10:30] <cannap> JSON.stringify(data,null,2)
[16:10:35] <robertmaxrees> Ziberius try .val() first.
[16:10:55] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: yes val() works
[16:11:02] <Ziberius> but I need the text, not the value
[16:11:08] <robertmaxrees> erm, huh?
[16:11:09] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[16:11:14] <robertmaxrees> okay - then use .find(':selected')
[16:11:22] <robertmaxrees> though that's kind of strange.
[16:11:59] <Ziberius> that works
[16:12:03] <Ziberius> thanx robertmaxrees
[16:12:04] <Ziberius> :-D
[16:12:44] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[19:24:48] <taplar> heh
[19:25:12] <taplar> am i a terrible person for having a chuckle that they are doing some sort of demonstration at the capital today and it's raining again?
[19:58:22] <kspr1> if i do: $(":input").on('input', function () {}; the event handler automatically will only trigger for input events in the first input field, i need it to trigger on any input field, why isn't that working? is this possible? thanks a lot for any insight.
[20:05:20] <taplar> console.log($(':input')); and see what you see
[20:21:58] <robertmaxrees> DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
[20:27:09] <graphettion> boobs?
[20:31:16] <nopea> is it not possible to change the CSS height property with jQuery?  I have tried jQuery(".elm").css("max-height","0"); and it is not changing.  I am abl eto change the opacity however with jQuery
[20:39:39] <robertmaxrees> you can change it.
[20:40:04] <robertmaxrees> is the element inline?  are you changing the correct element's height?
[20:40:05] <robertmaxrees> etc
[20:41:51] <nopea> I would have to investigate that.  Not sure what the elements styles are set to
[20:42:17] <robertmaxrees> you could look at the computed values and see.
[20:43:51] <nopea> robertmaxrees: yeah doing that now.  It is a woocommerce class I want to change the height of when clicking a button
