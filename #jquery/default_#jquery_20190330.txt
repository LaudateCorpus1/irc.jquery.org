[05:25:03] <benne> jhi guys i need some hjelp editing a function abnyone online here that may help me??
[05:41:56] <pavonia> benne: Just ask you question
[05:42:06] <pavonia> *your
[10:29:15] <Cypris> jquery provides a method for creating elements that allows you to provide an object containing the props and attrs, example: $("<div>",{ class:"something",text:"hi"} ); Is there a way to get that prop/attr object from jQuery?
[14:04:33] <mwpowellhtx> hello I have a jquery-ui question getting started
[14:05:27] <mwpowellhtx> mainly is jquery-ui a self-contained bundle? studying a couple of the demos it would seem this is the case, i.e. jquery dependencies included, etc.
[14:06:36] <mwpowellhtx> can anyone at all confirm this?
[14:06:59] <mwpowellhtx> I obtained the latest jquery-ui from npm sources
[14:07:13] <linux_daemon> hello all, i have a map in svg, and i want to extract coordinates to apply to jqvmap plugin, does anyone know how?
[14:09:30] <mwpowellhtx> as a migration path after I include the bootstrap script that is the new "init" place for warming up all things jquery-ui related, widgets and so forth?
[14:10:05] <mwpowellhtx> as opposed to a jquery $(function ...); ?
[14:11:03] <mwpowellhtx> hello?
[14:22:36] <linux_daemon> anyone?
[14:55:54] <robertparkerx> For some reason it is showing three/four X instead of one
[14:55:55] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/t78mgr51/
[14:55:59] <robertparkerx> Can someone help me?
[14:56:23] <robertparkerx> Oh wait
[18:54:26] <robertparkerx> jQuery('input[name="amount[Sat]['+artnumber+']"').val(); I can't get this to work
[18:54:45] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[18:55:19] <robertmaxrees> also: give this a read - https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[18:59:18] <robertparkerx> How wouuld I add artnumber to the name
[18:59:24] <robertparkerx> its a variable
[18:59:37] <robertmaxrees> the issue isn't artnumber :)
[18:59:43] <robertmaxrees> it's the square brackets.
[18:59:49] <robertmaxrees> you need to escape them.
[19:01:07] <robertparkerx> oh okay no I see
[19:01:15] <robertparkerx> How ? lol
[19:01:34] <robertmaxrees> did you read the page i linked?
[19:01:38] <robertparkerx> I had to brakcets wrong too
[19:01:45] <robertparkerx> Not all but I see name
[19:01:50] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:01:56] <robertmaxrees> the two paragraphs at top duder
[19:03:03] <robertparkerx> I didn't see that
[19:03:04] <robertparkerx> :(
[19:03:11] <robertmaxrees> see it now?
[19:04:46] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/LuK2Of2.png
[19:04:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:05:02] <robertparkerx> jQuery('[name="amount\\[Thu\\]\\['+artnumber+'\\]"]').val();
[19:05:06] <robertparkerx> ??
[19:05:18] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[19:06:31] <robertparkerx> It iddn't work
[19:06:37] <robertmaxrees> then make a fiddle :)
[19:06:44] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i can't troubleshoot what i can't see.
[19:13:44] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/2frx79gs/3/
[19:13:49] <robertparkerx> I think its working here though
[19:14:09] <robertmaxrees> have you console.log'd it out?
[19:14:21] <robertmaxrees> 'cause, like - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x7budejo/2/
[19:14:44] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, your smarter should would be to give all of these a class and then use .filter() with a function
[19:15:09] <robertparkerx> but my problem is that there could be more than one
[19:15:16] <robertparkerx> its a shortcode
[19:15:26] <robertmaxrees> that's fine?
[19:15:32] <robertmaxrees> why would that make a difference?
[19:15:56] <robertparkerx> because it selects the value from the first instance if it has some and adds products to the cart for its date
[19:16:05] <robertparkerx> instead of the date it should be setting
[19:16:09] <robertmaxrees> literally none of that means you can't use filter with a function.
[19:16:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:18:36] <robertmaxrees> et voila-  https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x7budejo/5/
[19:40:33] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees, for some reason I get illegal invocation when I try  https://gist.github.com/04b95d4373451bb29f8d99425cdffa90
[19:41:19] <robertmaxrees> what is artnumber?
[19:41:32] <robertparkerx> var artnumber = _this.attr('data-artnumber');
[19:41:48] <robertmaxrees> and if you console.log(artnumber) before you try to use it?
[19:42:26] <robertparkerx> ci2,16-0x1
[19:42:32] <robertparkerx> Yea its working
[19:42:40] <robertmaxrees> erm
[19:42:41] <robertmaxrees> so again
[19:42:54] <robertmaxrees> "To use any of the meta-characters ( such as  !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name,"
[19:43:06] <robertmaxrees> ah wait nvm.
[19:43:09] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:44:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vpu72t0b/
[19:44:10] <robertmaxrees> seems fine here.
[19:44:16] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using on your site?
[19:45:14] <robertparkerx> Wait it is working!
[19:45:19] <robertmaxrees> well alright.
[19:46:31] <robertparkerx> Thank you for being patient
[19:46:35] <robertmaxrees> sure
[19:47:49] <robertparkerx> Yep now my add to cart is workking for both shortcode
[19:48:19] <robertparkerx> I learned something too
[19:48:43] <robertmaxrees> :) rad.
[19:48:49] <robertmaxrees> also: why .attr() for the data attributes?
[19:50:21] <robertparkerx> It was that way. I am extending it. I'm fixing bugs I found with everythihng now.
[19:50:29] <robertmaxrees> heh alright.
[19:51:48] <robertparkerx> It's a custom AngularJS cart for WordPress that add item to user meta key. So far its been a real paid to jump through all the hurdles.
[19:51:56] <robertmaxrees> :|
[19:51:58] <robertmaxrees> erm
[19:52:06] <robertparkerx> I don't know why they didn't just use WooCommerce
[19:52:07] <robertmaxrees> your first problem is that you're using jquery with it at all heh
[19:52:12] <robertparkerx> Yes
[19:52:18] <robertmaxrees> if you're gonna use angular, use it.
[22:19:58] <madprops> is there a way to get the native e/event on input event?
[22:20:23] <robertmaxrees> $('input').on('input', function(e) { console.log(e) });
[22:20:36] <madprops> isn't that a special e?
[22:20:58] <madprops> im getting undefined here https://paste.merkoba.com/1553998853-rutunu-1
[22:22:24] <madprops> not sure how i would do event delegation on vanilla
[22:22:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:22:32] <robertmaxrees> slow down :)_
[22:23:02] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing "key" as a property for the event object?
[22:23:31] <madprops> it is on vanilla javascript, it's standard
[22:23:35] <madprops> but it's not in jquery
[22:23:36] <robertmaxrees> link to docs?
[22:23:54] <madprops> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key
[22:24:18] <robertmaxrees> ah okay okay
[22:24:24] <robertmaxrees> so wait
[22:24:33] <robertmaxrees> do you just need to know what character was just input?
[22:25:38] <robertmaxrees> if you need info on event delagation using native js, https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate is one example
[22:29:00] <madprops> oh so delegation in javascript is pretty raw...
[22:29:09] <madprops> i might as well just add an event listener to every input
[22:29:12] <madprops> they're not that many
[22:29:17] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that
[22:29:18] <robertmaxrees> but OK
[22:29:24] <madprops> nah i'll do delegation instead
[22:29:39] <robertmaxrees> you're already doing delegation
[22:30:14] <madprops> i mean with vanilla
[22:30:31] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[22:30:52] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[22:30:53] <robertmaxrees> event.originalEvent
[22:30:54] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[22:31:04] <robertmaxrees> > https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[22:31:11] <madprops> ohhh
[22:31:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:32:56] <madprops> hmm, this doesn't work https://paste.merkoba.com/1553999569-wimopi-1
[22:33:15] <madprops> return undefined
[22:33:20] <robertmaxrees> fiddle
[22:33:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:34:32] <madprops> https://jsfiddle.net/mdprops/pjf3wgm4/1/
[22:35:45] <robertmaxrees> interesting
[22:35:47] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[22:35:54] <robertmaxrees> so do you just want the pressed key?
[22:35:57] <robertmaxrees> also: why? :)
[22:37:08] <madprops> wait this is weird
[22:37:16] <madprops> im trying to do the native counterpart and is also returning undefined
[22:37:27] <madprops> https://jsfiddle.net/mdprops/pjf3wgm4/3/
[22:37:37] <madprops> (im making custom controls for my game)
[22:37:41] <robertmaxrees> so again
[22:37:50] <robertmaxrees> wwhat all are you actually trying to do
[22:37:51] <robertmaxrees> ?
[22:37:56] <madprops> ohhhh
[22:38:01] <robertmaxrees> do you want the keycode or...?
[22:38:02] <madprops> i think e.key is only for keydown/up
[22:38:29] <robertmaxrees> looking at the docs, no :)
[22:38:42] <robertmaxrees> but hey, being ignored is rad, too :)
[22:38:43] <madprops> it works with keyup now
[22:38:55] <madprops> i don't want the codes
[22:39:00] <robertmaxrees> the input event may be the issue but who knows?!
[22:39:02] <madprops> i want the name so i can display it without having to match it
[22:39:20] <madprops> the input event was indeed the issue, not sure why
[22:39:28] <robertmaxrees> because it's newer
[22:39:28] <madprops> keyup works though
[22:39:37] <robertmaxrees> also keydown may work :)
