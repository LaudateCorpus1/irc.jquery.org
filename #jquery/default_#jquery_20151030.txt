[00:55:13] <Turaiel> Quick question: why can I not trigger a right click event with .trigger if I've disabled the contextmenu event?
[00:56:33] <Turaiel> I saw that I can trigger a mousedown with the right button, but I've got mouseup and mousedown bound to something different
[01:02:01] <Turaiel> Actually I should probably give up for the night. I'll be back tomrorow.
[02:07:36] <BustyLoli-Chan> http://pastebin.com/UamvNFgm can someone tell me why this doesn't work?
[02:07:47] <BustyLoli-Chan> my done: function never seems to get called
[02:08:45] <robertmaxrees> too many args being passed.  you want a single argument instead.
[02:09:00] <BustyLoli-Chan> what do you mean?
[02:09:06] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/ca6d1e17df73
[02:09:11] <robertmaxrees> slidetoggle takes a single object.
[02:09:18] <BustyLoli-Chan> I see
[02:09:21] <robertmaxrees> *in the way you're trying to use it.
[02:12:17] <BustyLoli-Chan> Well...
[02:12:24] <BustyLoli-Chan> it worked... but the animation is not the best lol
[02:13:41] <Cork> BustyLoli-Chan: you normally want to try to avoid javascript animations
[02:14:00] <BustyLoli-Chan> what is preferred?
[02:14:05] <robertmaxrees> css
[02:14:06] <Cork> they will depends on not getting blocked by anything on the main thread (and basically everything blocks that)
[02:14:09] <Cork> ya
[02:14:29] <Cork> ^ the reason for that is that javascript is single threaded
[02:14:30] <BustyLoli-Chan> is there a CSS slide toggle? lol
[02:14:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd add/remove a class instead.
[02:14:42] <Cork> you trigger the animation from js
[02:14:49] <Cork> but the animation is done in css
[02:15:05] <Cork> @keyframe or just transition would do
[02:15:15] <Cork> depending on how advanced you need it to be
[02:15:33] <BustyLoli-Chan> I see
[02:15:42] <BustyLoli-Chan> I'll keep this in mind and look into it tomorr
[02:15:51] <BustyLoli-Chan> for now I think I'm going to bed... thank you all for your help!
[02:26:29] <ZeuZ> anyone around?
[02:26:54] <geoid> I'm using the the $("#myForm").serialize() function to capture form data for sending via ajax. Is there any way to get this to include disabled fields?
[02:27:21] <Cork> geoid: no
[02:27:34] <Cork> disabled fields aren't suppose to be included in form submissions
[02:27:50] <Cork> geoid: the simplest solution is to just add a hidden field right next to it with the same info
[02:28:29] <ZeuZ> http://codepad.org/clgTsAlj ---> what seems to be wrong with that? the GET petition is shown in the developer console but gets a "failed"
[02:30:56] <Cork> ZeuZ: your not quoting the src value
[02:31:19] <Cork> i would change append("<img src="+e.target.result+"/>") to append('<img src="'+e.target.result+'"/>')
[02:31:36] <Cork> if that doesn't help, you need to provide more context
[02:31:48] <ZeuZ> Cork, oh you;re right! thanks!
[02:31:55] <Cork> also don't run the selector twice, just run .append().append
[02:32:22] <ZeuZ> got it
[02:32:41] <Cork> or save the found element in a variable if you want to break up the line
[02:36:01] <t4nk741> sorry off topic
[02:36:02] <Logicgate> how tough would it be to make a gauge like this with svgs?
[02:36:02] <Logicgate> http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/sagarwal/network-speed-test-1.png
[02:36:21] <Cork> Logicgate: easy
[02:36:25] <Logicgate> I tried finding a library that had a double entity gauge pod without success.
[02:36:42] <Cork> it is basically just three circles
[02:36:51] <t4nk741> SORRY off topic what is the channel to ask CSS? i am banned on  #css 5 years ago still banned now :(
[02:37:00] <Logicgate> How do you cutoff the bottom Cork, like where the Start is.
[02:37:24] <Logicgate> just a square?
[02:37:25] <Cork> Logicgate: you make an arc (a way to make a circle)
[02:37:31] <Logicgate> oh!
[02:37:33] <Logicgate> makes sense
[02:37:37] <geoid>  Cork tx
[02:37:38] <t4nk741> anyone wanna help me with simple css solution?
[02:37:41] <Cork> and it has a precent of how far of the circle to draw
[02:37:56] <t4nk741> cork wtill here after all these years?
[02:38:08] <t4nk741> not dead? lol
[02:38:19] <Cork> t4nk741: msg an op and ask them to unban you
[02:38:28] <Cork> it is what they are there for
[02:38:34] <t4nk741> okay thanks
[02:38:42] <Cork> and unless you did something really horrible they should unban you
[02:39:06] <t4nk741> just silly stuff where is OP?
[02:39:08] <Cork> but ya... 3 years is a bit excessive
[02:39:46] <t4nk741> what is the command to chat with OP?
[02:41:43] <Logicgate> Cork, any way you could whip up an example for me?
[02:42:42] <Cork> Logicgate: no
[02:43:02] <Cork> Logicgate: it will still take some time to align the arcs so it looks correct
[02:43:11] <Cork> and i don't have time for that
[02:43:11] <Logicgate> right
[02:43:25] <t4nk741> tnx Cork figured it out
[02:43:56] <Cork> t4nk741: there is an irc command to list the ops, i've just forgotten it and can't find it right now >_<
[02:44:38] <t4nk741> now i am using webbased freenode i tried pidgin i was able to join #css
[02:44:46] <Cork> ah there it is
[02:44:52] <Cork> /cs access #css list
[02:50:14] <hellyeah> hey
[02:50:33] <hellyeah> is it $.each(variable, function()
[02:50:45] <hellyeah> or $(variable).each(function()
[02:50:59] <oojacoboo> is there any way to keep the selected option of a select when using .clone() for a form?
[02:51:12] <Cork> hellyeah: both
[02:51:17] <oojacoboo> does clone not preserve state?
[02:51:25] <Cork> hellyeah: it depends on what variable is
[02:52:02] <Cork> oojacoboo: .clone uses the doms cloneNode
[02:52:02] * oojacoboo needs to read API docs before bugging folks... dooop
[02:52:08] <Cork> so it has the same limitations
[02:52:11] <enerel> hi all
[02:52:13] <hellyeah> what do you mean by "what variable is" are you talking about type?  ?
[02:52:17] <enerel> missed me?
[02:52:19] <Cork> i think it goes in and forcefully reset some things though
[02:52:20] <oojacoboo> Cork:  withDataAndEvents (default: false)
[02:52:30] <oojacoboo> first method param
[02:52:53] <Cork> oojacoboo: those shouldn't effect the selected state of the element
[02:53:02] <oojacoboo> Cork: I'm sure JQ monkey patched the hell out of it
[02:53:10] <Cork> no
[02:53:17] <oojacoboo> Cork: no?
[02:53:31] <hellyeah> what is JQ monkey?
[02:53:32] <Cork> it runs a loop over the elements in the selection
[02:53:36] <Cork> cloneNode them
[02:53:41] <oojacoboo> what's "element data"?
[02:53:41] <Cork> and if that option is true
[02:53:47] <oojacoboo> what a vague description
[02:53:54] <Cork> lopps the $._data object and clones that
[02:53:57] <enerel> anyone remember ME?
[02:54:04] <oojacoboo> *sigh*
[02:54:09] <Cork> oojacoboo: it is what $._data holds
[02:54:13] <oojacoboo> any ideas on cloning to get the state?
[02:54:30] <oojacoboo> or cloning with state, rather
[02:54:40] <Cork> oojacoboo: it should hold it if i remember my cloneNode correctly
[02:54:57] <hellyeah> any comment to my question?
[02:54:58] <oojacoboo> state?
[02:55:06] <hellyeah> it depends in what extend?
[02:55:19] <oojacoboo> it's not, the selected option of a select defaults back
[02:55:30] <Cork> hellyeah: if you ask a question the least you could do is read the answers...
[02:55:59] <hellyeah> is it $.each(variable, function()
[02:55:59] <hellyeah> or $(variable).each(function()  ?
[02:56:16] <hellyeah> and you said hellyeah: it depends on what variable is
[02:56:28] <hellyeah> so i wonder what do you mean with what variable is
[02:59:55] <Cork> oojacoboo: ya, cloneNode does't clone the select state
[03:00:08] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea, just had to reset it onSubmit :(
[03:00:30] <oojacoboo> or set the value rather of the element
[03:00:32] <Cork> oojacoboo: for reference http://jsfiddle.net/vfsc52og/
[03:01:09] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea - kinda sucks, but I dunno, that's probably a preferred functionality for many cases
[03:01:13] <Cork> ^ that is basically what $().clone does
[03:01:24] <Cork> except it has a fallback if it isn't supported
[03:01:40] <Cork> oojacoboo: i think it is a compatibility choice actually
[03:01:56] <Cork> cause i remember this not being the case a while back
[03:01:58] <oojacoboo> I'm betting my inputs won't keep their value either
[03:02:01] <Cork> but i think ie did it
[03:02:31] <Cork> so what prob happend is that they changed how it works in the other browsers to line up with older ie
[03:02:37] <oojacoboo> ah
[03:03:20] <Cork> this is just me guessing though
[03:03:33] <Cork> i don't use .clone that often
[03:03:40] <oojacoboo> lol, the input value is preserved though
[03:04:13] <oojacoboo> yea, I just have a funny case with a form where you select a ton of items, where each has a hidden input value
[03:04:31] <oojacoboo> so I'm just grabbing the selected items and removing all the others from the set and then serializing it
[03:04:43] <oojacoboo> I'd do it all different if I were doing this UI, but it's already designed like that
[03:05:12] <Cork> oojacoboo: well you don't have to remove the elements from the dom
[03:05:25] <Cork> you could just remove them from the selection
[03:05:30] <oojacoboo> Cork: not the DOM, the cloned form
[03:05:32] <oojacoboo> removing them from the cloned form
[03:05:35] <oojacoboo> then serializing that cloned form
[03:05:48] <Cork> but why cloning the form?
[03:05:56] <Cork> that is kinda my point
[03:05:58] <oojacoboo> b/c I can't serialize the form in the DOM
[03:06:05] <Cork> why not?
[03:06:16] <oojacoboo> b/c it has tons of hidden inputs with id values
[03:06:30] <oojacoboo> I need just the ones "selected"
[03:06:46] <oojacoboo> granted I could serialize up that as it's own param and POST it with the other values, but then I'm just building out my POST params
[03:06:47] <Cork> $('#orgform').find(':input').not('input[type="hidden"]).serialize()=
[03:07:04] <oojacoboo> Cork: they're all hidden
[03:07:17] <Cork> ya, but my point is you can filter out the elements you don't want
[03:07:21] <Cork> you don't have to clone the elements
[03:07:30] <oojacoboo> $formSubmitFields.find("input.to-deposit:not(:checked)").closest("tr").remove()
[03:07:58] <oojacoboo> that make sense to you?
[03:08:01] <oojacoboo> it's a checkbox with a hidden input
[03:08:07] <oojacoboo> within a table row
[03:08:08] <Cork> ya, but again you don't have to remove the elements
[03:08:16] <Cork> you can just filter them out from the selection
[03:08:20] <oojacoboo> how else am I going to serialize the form?
[03:08:31] <Cork> i just gave you a line explaining that
[03:08:40] <oojacoboo> yea..., I can build out my params, like I was saying
[03:08:45] <Cork> no
[03:08:53] <Cork> $('#orgform').find(':input').not('input[type="hidden"]').serialize() <--
[03:09:02] <Cork> .not can take a function if you need more logic
[03:09:02] <oojacoboo> mmm
[03:09:22] <Cork> serialize can serialize a form or directly on the input elements
[03:09:30] <oojacoboo> yea, it'd need a function there prob
[03:09:32] <oojacoboo> I see what you're doing though
[03:10:17] <Cork> so i would try doing something like
[03:10:31] <Cork> $formSubmitFields.find(':input').not( $formSubmitFields.find("input.to-deposit:not(:checked)").closest("tr").remove()
[03:10:33] <Cork> opps
[03:10:58] <Cork> $formSubmitFields.find(':input').not($formSubmitFields.find("input.to-deposit:not(:checked)").closest("tr").find(':input')).serialize()
[03:10:58] <oojacoboo> heh
[03:11:30] <oojacoboo> Cork ":input"?
[03:11:35] <oojacoboo> not familiar with that pseudo
[03:11:46] <oojacoboo> is that for hidden?
[03:11:46] <Cork> it is a jquery extension function
[03:11:59] <Cork> it matches 'input, select, button'
[03:12:09] <Uhkis> not textarea?
[03:12:14] <oojacoboo> Cork: on yea
[03:12:17] <oojacoboo> oh yea*
[03:12:19] <Cork> it matches textarea too
[03:12:20] <oojacoboo> I recall that now
[03:12:34] <Cork> i just missed listing it :)
[03:12:55] <Cork> rinputs = /^(?:input|select|textarea|button)$/i
[03:13:14] <AbuDhar> hey
[03:13:20] <AbuDhar> which HTML element should I use for a big slogan?
[03:13:32] <AbuDhar> <h1>?
[03:13:58] <oojacoboo> AbuDhar: prob h2
[03:14:00] <Cork> AbuDhar: => #html
[03:14:02] <oojacoboo> but it depends
[03:14:12] <Cork> no slogan doesn't belong in a header tag
[03:14:17] <AbuDhar> Cork: I am muted in there.
[03:14:23] <AbuDhar> long time ago.
[03:14:32] <oojacoboo> Cork: it could be a header item
[03:14:44] <oojacoboo> depends on the context I think
[03:14:48] <AbuDhar> the only thing in the div will be the slogan
[03:14:58] <Cork> oojacoboo: no, slogan isn't a header, like i just said
[03:15:13] <AbuDhar> is there a <big> element?
[03:15:18] <oojacoboo> lol
[03:15:23] <AbuDhar> :P
[03:15:33] <Cork> AbuDhar: the tag should describe what it holds, not how it looks
[03:15:33] <AbuDhar> This feature is obsolete. Although it may still work in some browsers, its use is discouraged since it could be removed at any time. Try to avoid using it.
[03:15:44] <AbuDhar> it holds a slogan
[03:15:53] <AbuDhar> like CHANGES THE WORLD
[03:16:02] <AbuDhar> Name of the product - changes the world
[03:16:04] <AbuDhar> something like that
[03:16:17] <oojacoboo> AbuDhar: if it's a header to the content, then a heading tag could make sense
[03:16:21] <oojacoboo> it depends on the context
[03:16:30] <AbuDhar> there is no other content than the slogan
[03:17:12] <oojacoboo> AbuDhar: I long gave up on the internet/world and semantic markup... no one cares
[03:17:15] <oojacoboo> :(
[03:17:35] <AbuDhar> hahah :P yeah I dunno why I care about it.. I could just use <p></p> and then styl eit
[03:17:35] <oojacoboo> every site on the net is nothing but a bunch of div tags
[03:17:37] <AbuDhar> style it*
[03:17:53] <Cork> AbuDhar: i would prob structure it like <header><h1>Page name</h1><p>the slogan goes here</p>
[03:18:05] <Cork> +</header>
[03:18:28] <Cork> and then you can style the p in the header how ever you like
[03:18:57] <AbuDhar> but it is not in the header
[03:19:00] <AbuDhar> it is in a section
[03:19:03] <AbuDhar> <section>
[03:19:12] <AbuDhar> it comes when you scroll down
[03:19:21] <Cork> why would you have the slogan in a section of the page?
[03:19:35] <AbuDhar> because at the top I have the nav and a background video
[03:19:41] <Cork> hmm would prob use an aside with a class then
[03:21:00] <AbuDhar> so <section><div class="container"><div class="row"><aside>slogan here</aside></div></div></section> like this? :D
[03:21:22] <Cork> <aside class="slogan">slogan here</aside>
[03:21:24] <Cork> but ya
[03:21:30] <AbuDhar> I am using bootstrap :P
[03:21:32] <AbuDhar> didn't mention
[03:22:01] <Cork> the reason why it should go in a aside is cause it isn't the main content
[03:22:10] <Cork> it is just fluff content
[03:22:28] <AbuDhar> thanks :P
[03:25:49] <oojacoboo> Cork: thanks for the help with that btw
[03:26:12] <oojacoboo> it did do the trick - cleaned it up a little
[03:26:47] <Cork> oojacoboo: nice
[03:27:19] <AbuDhar> is em better for responsiveness?
[03:27:32] <oojacoboo> AbuDhar: again, semantics
[03:27:52] <oojacoboo> AbuDhar: em = emphasis
[03:28:12] <AbuDhar> em for font-size
[03:28:13] <AbuDhar> I mean
[03:28:30] <oojacoboo> AbuDhar: it's the same as % really
[03:28:32] <oojacoboo> there is rem too ;)
[03:28:58] <oojacoboo> I prefer to use % on the body/html then em for everything thereafter
[03:29:00] <oojacoboo> that way you have a clean baseline
[03:29:50] <Cork> AbuDhar: i prefer rem
[03:30:07] <Cork> else you get annoying situations where the size change based on the parent
[03:30:12] <Cork> and you get escalating changes
[03:30:23] <Cork> rem is always based on the font-size of the body
[03:30:51] <oojacoboo> I'm just old school
[03:31:00] <oojacoboo> and use to using em :P
[03:31:15] <Cork> em has much better backwards compatibility
[03:31:37] <Cork> but if you can use rem it removes a lot of problems (doesn't work in like ie6 and back though)
[03:32:01] <oojacoboo> Cork: those problems could be seen as features too :P
[03:32:49] <Cork> oojacoboo: that the accordion topic becomes 32px cause it is put inside another accordion? (jquery-ui)
[03:33:00] <Cork> i would say that is a bug :)
[03:33:26] <Cork> it is most likely fixed now, but it was really annoying when i first saw it a few years back
[03:33:43] <oojacoboo> Cork: yea... I don't like people playing with my css either :)
[03:33:58] <oojacoboo> can we just have web components already...
[03:34:04] <Cork> oojacoboo: the css was the one shipped with jquery ui
[03:34:16] <oojacoboo> Cork: no doubt - not surprised
[03:34:18] <Cork> its own css broke if you nested two accordion
[03:34:28] <Cork> and it was cause of em
[03:34:37] <oojacoboo> Cork: I rarely find good css shipped
[03:34:41] <Cork> s/em/rem/g fixed that
[03:34:41] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> and it was cause of rem
[03:34:45] <oojacoboo> I prefer my libs without css
[03:34:57] <Cork> b-ot: you fail

[03:35:13] <Cork> oojacoboo: same here
[03:35:25] <Cork> oojacoboo: like i said this was quite a while ago
[03:35:45] <oojacoboo> I have an entire dir with our assets for "vendor_overrides"
[03:35:58] <oojacoboo> it's a bunch of css override files :((
[03:36:17] <oojacoboo> better believe there is a nice fat jquery_ui one too
[03:36:44] <Cork> i just only include the core css from jquery ui
[03:36:55] <Cork> then you write the theme your self
[03:37:01] <oojacoboo> I won't use jquery_ui again prob
[03:37:09] <oojacoboo> it's already on the out and out
[03:37:12] <Cork> its dialog and sliders are nice
[03:37:30] <oojacoboo> Cork: wrote my own dialog called "phatbox"
[03:37:34] <Cork> but ya, i'm moving to basically only use there sliders now days
[03:38:05] <oojacoboo> it was such a central part of our UI we needed it custom at the time
[03:38:30] <oojacoboo> there may be better ones now - but they all use too many assumptions
[03:40:34] <oojacoboo> https://www.dropbox.com/s/tszdg35tzxs284d/Screenshot%202015-10-30%2003.40.29.png?dl=0
[03:41:03] <oojacoboo> more of a modal
[03:41:07] <oojacoboo> but used like a dialog too
[03:59:17] <hellyeah> very short question
[04:00:07] <hellyeah> can i set every css attribute from attr function like margin, padding, font-size, color, background-color, font-face etc.
[04:00:09] <hellyeah> ?
[04:00:42] <hellyeah> also html attributes like title
[04:01:49] <FilipNortic> there is a css() function
[04:02:48] <FilipNortic> but I think you can set all (most) attr in js that doen't mean that you should though
[04:02:51] <hellyeah> yeah i know css() function i just try to figure out what i can include in attr() there is also prop()
[04:03:51] <hellyeah> hmm attr is for html attributes css is css for attributes may be i am in learning process.
[04:04:13] <FilipNortic> yes prop updates the attribute by changing the js property sometimes they seam to work the same way but it's a different  js operation
[04:05:03] <hellyeah> in what extend?
[04:06:56] <hellyeah> .each, reduce, .map. Function after . is called callback function? I dont understand that concept
[04:07:56] <FilipNortic> basicly it accepts a function as an argument
[04:08:24] <hellyeah> ic
[04:08:38] <hellyeah> well the video i aö watching create a json string
[04:08:54] <hellyeah> and give title, style, name attribute
[04:09:29] <hellyeah> and they do $('div').attr(jsonString');
[04:09:34] <hellyeah> is that the better way
[04:09:38] <hellyeah> let me jsfiddle
[04:10:11] <hellyeah> it seems handy
[04:17:01] <hellyeah> what am i doing wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/h0jw2cdf/3/
[04:17:45] <lenswipee> when i close a jquery dialog the modal is set back to false but the dialog itself doesn't close. This seems to happen so far in chrome, but all works as expected in IE. any ideas?
[04:19:22] <lenswipee> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/h0jw2cdf/4/
[04:20:41] <hellyeah> actrually i want to define json string instead of json object
[04:20:51] <hellyeah> hmm let me use JSON.stringify
[04:21:58] <lenswipee> hellyeah: google json string structure
[04:22:36] <hellyeah> one of video i watched suggest that way do you think it is good way to do it?
[04:23:18] <hellyeah> what do you think
[04:28:52] <hellyeah> damn
[04:28:56] <hellyeah> i forgot again
[04:29:06] <hellyeah> here jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/h0jw2cdf/8/

[06:42:02] <hellyeah> hey is this approach suggested? https://jsfiddle.net/h0jw2cdf/8/ that do a  json string and give ass attr
[07:05:08] <silverdust> hellyeah: attr() will need a second argument to store it in an attribute
[07:07:30] <hellyeah> actually the logic is as far as i understand attr("title" , "New Div Title") ? but ot sure
[07:10:45] <hellyeah> i read append and prepend do same task but the parameters are different
[07:10:54] <hellyeah> why both is same, they exist
[07:12:48] <hellyeah> hey question: is it good to store that data in data attribute of button or do i need something else? https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/131/

[08:10:54] <manners13> i can sort out the PHP to process the array when it does contain the rest of the information but im confused as to why it doesnt get it

[09:18:53] <Jubei> guys I have <tr> with a specific class so I can search for it by class. All <tr> have the exact number/type of <td> under them. under some <td> (no class) there is an <a href="someurl">blah</a>. Is it possible to access that <a>..</a> even if it has no class?
[09:19:24] <Cork> Jubei: sure
[09:19:43] <Cork> firstly is there other a tags you need to avoid?
[09:19:50] <Cork> (in the said tr)
[09:19:54] <Jubei> so it's <tr><td></td><td><a>...</a></td> .. I'm trying to read the contents of <href="..."> under <a>
[09:20:07] <Jubei> Cork: no nothing I need to avoid
[09:20:20] <Cork> $('tr.the-class a').attr('href')
[09:20:51] <Jubei> Cork: so that will give me ALL <a>'s under that class of <tr> correct?
[09:20:58] <Cork> yes
[09:21:04] <Cork> well $() will grab that
[09:21:10] <Cork> and .attr will grab the first one
[09:21:15] <Cork> and return the href for it
[09:21:15] <Jubei> Apologies turns out there ARE <a> tags I want to avoid :)
[09:21:19] <Jubei> but I know the order
[09:21:30] <Cork> Jubei: make a jsfiddle
[09:21:49] <Cork> including the table, an example of the tr, td and the links (the content doesn't have to be live)
[09:21:59] <Jubei> Cork: ok great
[09:22:29] <Cork> Jubei: also in the script area add the context of where you are going to try to access this
[09:22:34] <Cork> you might have help there
[09:33:37] <Jubei> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/2gqobzr0/
[09:33:46] <Jubei> Cork: it's a bit messy but so is the original html page I'm trying to parse
[09:34:42] <Jubei> Cork: the 2nd <a> tag has some browse.php?iidb=<some number> that's one of the numbers I'm trying to get
[09:34:59] <Cork> that would be the third actually :)
[09:35:15] <Cork> Jubei: and you can't use class="freetorrent" ?
[09:35:45] <Jubei> Cork: can you please reload?
[09:36:07] <Jubei> because I don't think we're seeing the same fiddle
[09:38:09] <Jubei> Cork: so the <tr class="req_row"> has 3 td elements under it. Is it possible to refer to those elements likke... $("tr.req_row").td[2]
[09:38:29] <Cork> Jubei: the fiddle changes url when you save it
[09:38:32] <Cork> (or update)
[09:38:39] <Jubei> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/2gqobzr0/1/
[09:38:40] <Cork> so post the url when you update
[09:39:33] <Cork> Jubei: https://jsfiddle.net/2gqobzr0/2/
[09:40:13] <Jubei> Cork: the 3rd <a> element HAS indeed class freebook.. the 2nd though, the one I want does not
[09:40:33] <Cork> ah
[09:40:43] <Cork> is catlink always a sibling?
[09:40:52] <Jubei> Cork: yes
[09:41:10] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/2gqobzr0/3/
[09:41:18] <Cork> you can base it on the td numbering
[09:41:27] <Cork> but it is normally cleaner to do it based on a class
[09:41:33] <Cork> one min let me show you an alternative
[09:41:40] <Jubei> Cork: I understand and if that was the case for all of them I'd like to do it by class.
[09:41:53] <Jubei> Cork: but some of the ones I want to parse don't have class, which is why I'd like to base it on order
[09:42:29] <Cork> Jubei: https://jsfiddle.net/2gqobzr0/4/ is an alternative to /3/
[09:42:42] <Cork> but i _reacommend_ using /3/
[09:42:48] <Cork> *recommend*
[09:42:51] <Jubei> Cork: thank you very much!
[09:42:56] <Jubei> Cork: I really appreciate the help.
[09:43:00] <Cork> np
[09:43:13] <Cork> the questions are quite easy when you have the markup
[09:45:07] <Jubei> Cork: one last quick question. for every <tr> that I'm parsing I want to save 2-3 values and store them in some list that I can then later run through and generate some other elements. Does jQuery provide such classes?
[09:45:17] <Jubei> I think it's like a dictionary
[09:45:38] <Jubei> because it's like.. multiple rows of  "id,title,category"
[09:46:00] <Jubei> does jquery provide some class to help with that or would I have to use some external library?
[09:47:06] <jop008> I have a field like this <input name="4617_combined_score" data-min="11" data-max="54" id="4617_combined_score" value="" type="number">
[09:47:36] <jop008> the value is 33 and when I do oel.blur() it is earased to blanks
[09:47:44] <jop008> I can't see why
[09:47:58] <jop008> it looks like blur is the standard jquery one
[09:56:58] <hellyeah> hey
[09:57:19] <hellyeah> i didnt get any error on console but seems button click not working can you help me to figure out why https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/145/
[09:57:50] <hellyeah> sec
[09:58:30] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/147/
[09:59:00] <hellyeah> aha
[09:59:05] <hellyeah> it didnt add buttonClass
[09:59:12] <hellyeah> hmm let me try addClass
[10:00:31] <hellyeah> finally i got something but line 30 not working
[10:00:33] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/149/
[10:12:37] <jop008> I have this fiddlle http://jsfiddle.net/8xP3J/149/ which is working as expected but in my life code the 33 is wiped out can't see why
[10:13:50] <jop008> how can I check for the presence of  a non standard blur routine?
[10:14:38] <Cork> jop008: and your sure you don't have any other code the blue might trigger?
[10:14:51] <jop008> Not sure
[10:14:54] <Cork> the problem is most likely outside the code you posted
[10:15:00] <Cork> uh
[10:15:03] <Cork> actually
[10:15:07] <Cork> there is one big problem with it
[10:15:12] <Cork> you aren't defining oel
[10:15:17] <Cork> so it becomes a global
[10:15:29] <jop008> maybe that can do the trick
[10:15:32] <jop008> lets check
[10:15:53] <Cork> ("use strict"; FTW!)
[10:15:56] <jop008> in my actual coding I have var oel
[10:16:14] <Cork> in that case, then ya outside the code you pasted
[10:16:41] <jop008> that's for sure but how can I detect what blur is doing
[10:16:50] <jop008> I did step interactive debugging
[10:17:01] <jop008> but I couldnt detect it
[10:25:33] <MAxou> Hey I want do a jquery to clean my html table about doubloon. I want hide all doubloon exept one the more recent in date how can i do this easily ?
[10:34:37] <robhol> uh.. doubloon?
[10:34:43] <robhol> do you mean duplicates?
[10:35:38] <hellyeah> it is not working damn it
[10:41:29] <MAxou> robhol ye sI mean duplicate
[10:41:47] <decx> use filter()
[10:42:41] <MAxou> thx decs I will look how it's wor
[10:43:55] <diamonds> do yall have a stock explanation for "it only affects the last element in my loop"?
[10:58:07] <robhol> diamonds: it's not in your loop? :D
[10:58:40] <robhol> in general, "stock explanations" suck. Easier to post the code
[11:25:33] <isthisreallife> https://dpaste.de/o8xD#L110,119  why it doesnt add class_name to all elements? only last one? its in each statement
[11:25:36] <isthisreallife> howw to fix it
[11:25:38] <isthisreallife> help plox
[11:27:43] <isthisreallife> :>
[11:41:59] <Jubei_> guys I'm trying a jquery command in the console and it returns a list of all the number of elements it found matching. Is this a standard javascript type? like.. array or something? i.e. can I save that list?
[11:46:19] <LindsayMac> Jubei:  whats your code like?
[11:46:31] <Jubei> LindsayMac: $("tr.req_row td:nth-child(2) a:nth-child(1)")
[11:46:59] <Jubei> when i run this in google chrome console I get a big list of elements
[11:47:32] <sublimetext>     $('#ys_shipBillBillingInfo').prepend('<h2 style="font-weight: bold; padding: 20px 0px;font-family:"Noto Sans";">Billing Information</h2>');
[11:47:32] <sublimetext>  
[11:47:36] <LindsayMac> Jubei: jQuery object known as the "wrapped set,"
[11:47:39] <sublimetext> the font family somehow messes up on that
[11:47:59] <Jubei> LindsayMac: aah.. so that's jQuery coming back. gotcha. Thank you!
[11:58:16] <Uhkis> sublimetext: use a class.
[12:06:11] <Jubei> LindsayMac: $("a") returns a wrapped set but $("a").attr('href') does not. Is that normal?
[12:06:25] <robertmaxrees> .attr('href') returns a string.
[12:06:56] <Jubei> robertmaxrees: yes but it only returns from the first element of the wrapped set. I am trying to iterate and get all of them then build a new array or something
[12:07:02] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:07:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's normal/.
[12:07:10] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to use .map()
[12:07:19] <Jubei> robertmaxrees: thank you
[12:07:36] <robertmaxrees> $('a').map(function() { return $(this).prop('href'); }).get();
[12:07:39] <robertmaxrees> that'll get you the array
[12:08:02] <robertmaxrees> you could skip the jquery object and just to this.href if you know every a will have an href.
[12:09:16] <Jubei> robertmaxrees: i see. thank you very much!±
[12:48:01] <plamb> am i writing this if statement correctly?
[12:48:03] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/8g98Hwpx
[12:48:29] <robertmaxrees> where's your indentaion?
[12:48:50] <plamb> tfw intellij is my editor
[12:48:56] <decx> what's window.screen?
[12:49:09] <plamb> i dont know but it worked in another piece of javascript
[12:49:12] <robertmaxrees> wat.  intellij works fine for me.
[12:49:28] <plamb> i.e. if (window.screen.width > 1025) {new WOW().init();}
[12:49:33] <plamb> works as expected
[12:50:43] <plamb> since this is jquery should i use $(window).width() ?
[12:50:57] <decx> oh i remember now, why do i never use screen tho?
[12:51:43] <plamb> basically i just want it to not run the carousel js when the window is smaller than 640px
[12:52:02] <decx> console.log all the things
[12:52:56] <plamb> weird yeah
[12:53:03] <plamb> window.screen.width returns the right value
[12:53:09] <plamb> the carousel is still running though...
[13:24:46] <MikeD_> if I have registered a change event listener on a parent and on a child, the change on the child bubbles to the parent... how does the parent know the event is caused by the child?
[13:24:58] <robertmaxrees> because of bubbling.
[13:25:09] <robertmaxrees> the event emits from that element.
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> so it bubbles up and carries all that information with it.
[13:25:35] <MikeD_> right, but what property does the handler examine to know that the emitting element is or is not the parent element?
[13:25:44] <MikeD_> i'm not using delegation in this case
[13:26:06] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[13:39:25] <trent_> hi guys, need a little info,
[13:39:37] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[13:40:03] <trent_> i am making a page using html kick started..  it uses jquery for most of the functions.. so need info if my requirements can be met with jquery.
[13:40:23] <robertmaxrees> what are your requirements?
[13:41:27] <trent_> i want to use html page to get a list of inputs from the users .. filename, sql query (in a text area) and then..
[13:41:50] <trent_>  i want jquery on click of button.. create a script  with filename as above.. with sql query from the text area.. and then wrap the rest of the script with some template..
[13:42:54] <trent_> i primarily work as an oracle dba.. and i have basic knowledge on html/c++ .. hence the doubts..
[13:43:32] <robertmaxrees> sure.  all that is pretty basic.  do you want to save any of this to a server?
[13:44:19] <trent_> yes.. the output script will be saved back to where the html is hosted..
[13:46:05] <robertmaxrees> you need to hav some kind of server-side setup for that part.
[13:47:10] <trent_> sorry but i dont understand..  server side setup on the linux box ?
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> yes.  like php, python, perl, node...
[13:47:29] <robertmaxrees> html/js alone cannot save anything to the server.
[13:47:41] <robertmaxrees> you'll need some kind of server-side language to handle that part.
[13:48:16] <trent_> jquery wont be able to spool a file with the contents.. ?
[13:48:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:48:29] <robertmaxrees> javascript cannot do that.
[13:48:38] <robertmaxrees> imagine what kind of security vulnerability that would present
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> if JS could just inject content into the filesystem.
[13:49:26] <trent_> true.. dint think of it that way..
[13:49:44] <robertmaxrees> so you need a server-side setup first.  tons of choices there.
[13:51:18] <trent_> ok.. jquery can just pull the data from the html.. and is there any way to push or save the content somewhere ?
[13:51:25] <trent_> into a variable or something ?
[13:51:46] <robertmaxrees> form submits can do that part
[13:53:06] <trent_> i am limited with time.. if its too much research.. i might have to jump to a different option..
[13:59:55] <robertmaxrees> you may have to do that then.
[14:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to learn multiple technologies to do it.
[14:57:03] <Twirl> Hello, i'm trying to fix a wordpress site and when i scroll to the bottom of the page it jumps up like crazy, is there a way to find what's doing it?
[15:01:29] <robertmaxrees> look for something bound to the scroll evemt
[15:01:45] <Twirl> robertmaxrees: where lol
[15:02:11] <robertmaxrees> literal grep through your files
[15:03:04] <Twirl> robertmaxrees: u sure its that
[15:03:24] <robertmaxrees> you didn't provide any other information, so i'm not sure what else you're expecting me to say ;)
[15:07:35] <Twirl> robertmaxrees: if i open the console it doesnt happen
[15:09:21] <Zzaichik> he means, you need to look through the files - go find the javascript folder and go through the files in there until you find that scroll event.
[15:16:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:17:44] <MikeD_> does the .position() UI plugin work on jquery version 1.11 ?
[15:18:01] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery ui are you using?
[15:19:26] <MikeD_> 1.11.4
[15:19:43] <robertmaxrees> then yes.  1.11.4 is compatible with jquery 1.6+
[15:35:39] <sublimetext> whats the propery that tells you how far from the top of the window and element is?
[15:35:47] <sublimetext> .totop or something
[15:40:23] <robertmaxrees> i think you mean http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[15:48:06] <sublimetext> .offset().top
[15:48:10] <sublimetext> thx robertmaxrees  =]
[15:48:12] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[16:08:24] <sublimetext> anything wrong with this? http://pastie.org/10518840
[16:10:20] <robertmaxrees> is it not working as expected?
[16:11:35] <robertmaxrees> sublimetext
[17:13:24] <Jubei> guys I am trying to "store" an object but I'm not sure how to.
[17:13:26] <Jubei> http://codepad.org/jNfcGLfW
[17:13:55] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:14:04] <Jubei> when I run a command that collects the data I want from the document in the console, it returns an object
[17:14:09] <kevireilly> Jubei: seems like an array-like object (like `arguments`)
[17:14:25] <robertmaxrees> those bot return arrays.
[17:14:26] <Jubei> kevireilly: when I store that to a var though.. it only keeps the FIRST one
[17:14:27] <robertmaxrees> *both
[17:14:45] <kevireilly> also that was me forgetting that all arrays return object as the type ;)
[17:14:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:15:38] <Jubei> kevireilly: so it's an array? Any way I can save an array so that I can traverse it later?
[17:15:47] <robertmaxrees> assign it to a var.
[17:16:06] <robertmaxrees> "save"
[17:16:13] <robertmaxrees> *is ephemeral - what do you mean by that?
[17:18:09] <Jubei> kevireilly robertmaxrees : thanks.
[18:08:37] <Streusel> question.. would writing the result from autocomplete into a specific textarea be an option?
[18:09:14] <Streusel> since I want to be able to drag it, I'd want it to be written in a list
[18:12:06] <VectorX> hi, on this page http://bit.ly/1jXNDD6 the top menu collapses when you scroll down, but its now happeing in ie, can someone tell me whats wrong ?

[18:24:22] <VectorX> akkufomk yeah i just got it
[18:24:43] <VectorX> it was height : initial; causing the issue, made it height : auto;
[18:25:44] <VectorX> got another wierd problem though, if you click on the lines near the menu, you get a sidebar, on that if you open a menu the bullets are all triangles in IE but other browsers its dots as expected
[18:25:48] <VectorX> any thoughts
