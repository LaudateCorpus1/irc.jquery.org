[16:35:10] <mrush> is there a way to access margin values, for the purpose of calculating width of what's inside a div?
[16:35:30] <mrush> because .outerWidth() doesnt include margins
[17:29:02] <mrush> suppose i can track margins separately
[17:29:04] <mrush> thx
[20:46:50] <tehSpork> is this a good place for newbie questions? :)
[20:47:31] <tehSpork> im trying to get an audio file to play on load and pause while the mouse left button is held down
[23:56:18] <SideFX> I have a <td class="amount">23.22</td>,  I have a click listener so if you click the number it will capture the amount, but there is an ID associated with the amount, is there a place in this html I can put the id as a value to fetch it with jquery?
[23:57:45] <SideFX> I guess I could add a hidden input and assign a value to it and fetch it when next element
