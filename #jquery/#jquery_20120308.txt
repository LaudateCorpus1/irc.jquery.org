[00:00:43] <Es0teric> yes, Whirl3dOrd3r - in addition, i want to show/hide project details according to the corresponding project number thats active
[00:01:08] <Whirl3dOrd3r> you may be looking for an accordian script, really.
[00:01:17] <Es0teric> accordion?
[00:01:32] <Whirl3dOrd3r> it expands one element and contracts the others...
[00:01:46] <Whirl3dOrd3r> ? .accordian @EsOteric
[00:01:49] <bot-t> EsOteric, #2988 (Simple "Accordian" type effect crash IE6) – jQuery Core ... - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2988
[00:01:56] <Es0teric> what?
[00:01:58] <Whirl3dOrd3r> woops. lol
[00:01:59] <Es0teric> dude its Es0teric
[00:02:02] <Es0teric> lol
[00:02:04] <Es0teric> zero
[00:03:04] <Whirl3dOrd3r> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[00:04:54] <Es0teric> Whirl3dOrd3r, i'll try thatâ€¦ thx
[00:12:51] <crashev> hello, I have var content='<div id="one"> lalal </div> <div id="two"> hello </div>"; <- how to convert it to object so I can do something like $(content).find('#two'); ?
[00:13:42] <Whirl3dOrd3r> did you try it ?
[00:14:07] <crashev> Whirl3dOrd3r: yes I did, did not work
[00:14:30] <Whirl3dOrd3r> try appending the content to the dom?
[00:14:37] <crashev> I tryed $(content).find('#two').html('something');
[00:15:13] <xec> crashev: you need a single root element
[00:15:21] <Whirl3dOrd3r> $("<div id='one'/>").appendTo("body").find("#one").html("stuff); should work
[00:15:39] <xec> crashev: something like $('<div>').html(content).find('#two');
[00:16:03] <NoReGreT> any idea why the extra data values aren't submitted? http://pastie.org/3543838 the selectors are correct, i checked them
[00:17:17] <xec> Whirl3dOrd3r: i don't think you need to attach it
[00:17:56] <xec> Whirl3dOrd3r: plus, your .find() now is executed on the div#one (and won't find anything seeing as it IS the collection rather than containing it)
[00:18:43] <Whirl3dOrd3r> Yeah. I always mess up when using append or appendTo. I lose track of my scope for some reason.
[00:21:42] <Es0teric> Whirl3dOrd3r, how would i use that .accordion() and have the <li> trigger the items on/off?
[00:23:52] <crashev> xec: ok, but how to convert this content var to object, work on it, and then append the whole thing to something? if I do content = $('<div>').html(content).find('#two').html('works now'); , I will have only div id=two in this ?
[00:23:54] <xec> NoReGreT: what is .ajaxForm() ?
[00:24:43] <xec> crashev: "this" no, "content" yes ;)
[00:24:52] <crashev> xec: ahh nvm, I think I got it ;]
[00:24:58] <dfsdfs> jh
[00:25:00] <dfsdfs> h
[00:25:01] <dfsdfs> h
[00:25:01] <dfsdfs> h
[00:25:01] <dfsdfs> h
[00:25:02] <dfsdfs> h
[00:25:02] <dfsdfs> h
[00:25:06] <xec> well, you will have the jquery collection
[00:25:08] <crashev> almost
[00:25:14] <dfsdfs> hi all
[00:25:23] <crashev> at the end of my work I need to get rid of this additional div ;]
[00:26:09] <NoReGreT> xec: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[00:26:10] <crashev> xec: thx, all works now like I wanted! :)
[00:29:46] <xec> NoReGreT: the keys look very strange, maybe that's what's confusing it?
[00:30:22] <xec> NoReGreT: and are you sure $(this) is what you want it to be?
[00:30:35] <NoReGreT> xec: i see the keys submitted, but they are empty
[00:30:44] <NoReGreT> xec: yeah, i'm sure
[00:30:55] <NoReGreT> and the traversing is correct
[00:31:04] <xec> NoReGreT: how sure, on a scale from 0 to 10
[00:31:09] <xec> in binary
[00:31:22] <NoReGreT> lol
[00:31:36] <xec> NoReGreT: you're not inside some callback, so i'm thinking this === window
[00:32:21] <xec> NoReGreT: and you got a trailing comma after the last one
[00:34:17] <Es0teric> xec, do you know how to accomplish what jquery cycle does without the plugin? i saw i can use an accordion  function from jquery ui BUT i dont know how to make it active on the <li>'s http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/21/
[00:35:36] <xec> NoReGreT: these are all wild guesses though, i can't really help without a live demo with some context
[00:36:24] <NoReGreT> xec: http://pastie.org/3547013 isn't my traversing correct ?
[00:36:58] <xec> NoReGreT: you first need to find out what $(this) is
[00:38:32] <NoReGreT> xec: a console.log$(this) in the callback gives me [Object { url="/cake/news/aEmail", type="post", iframeSrc="about:blank", more...}]
[00:38:58] <xec> NoReGreT: yes but that is in the callback, not the options, or what
[00:39:52] <Xotix> Does the file input have somethign which prevents the user from uploading the same file twice? one after the other?
[00:39:58] <NoReGreT> xec: how can I check $(this) in the options..
[00:41:40] <xec> NoReGreT: something like this? http://pastie.org/3547044
[00:45:02] <__composern> is someone using jquery^datatables ?
[00:45:14] <__composern> or any help will appricated
[00:45:57] <__composern> http://78.180.208.200
[00:46:38] <__composern> http://78.180.208.200/reseller/r.php
[00:46:46] <__composern> user: test / pass:test
[00:47:44] <NoReGreT> xec: i got "test _firebugIgnore" posted in firebug..
[00:48:09] <xec> and nothing in console?
[00:49:50] <xec> NoReGreT: anyway, my point is that an object literal never changes what "this" is (and doesnt have its own scope either)
[00:50:06] <NoReGreT> xec: I got Document /cake/news/index/]
[00:50:17] <NoReGreT> I got your point
[00:50:34] <xec> NoReGreT: you might as well put $(this) a couple lines up and it would be the same thing
[00:50:54] <NoReGreT> yeah, that refers to the whole page
[00:53:00] <__composern> any idea ?
[00:53:23] <xec> ?anyone @ __composern
[00:53:23] <bot-t> __composern, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[00:56:32] <__composern> xec i am using jquery+jquery datatables plugin. i have two coulum, main bar, side bar.  when i activate jquery u-i  main coloum increase height automatically
[00:56:59] <__composern> i dont know how to fix it
[00:57:24] <__composern> now you will say paste to code on jsfiddle
[00:57:27] <xec> __composern: i would estimate a 98% chance this is a css issue
[00:57:52] <xec> __composern: are you using floats to position the layout columns?
[00:57:53] <__composern> yes but its jquery-ui div-clear fix
[00:58:10] <xec> __composern: do you know what a block formatting context is?
[00:58:42] <__composern> http://78.180.208.200/reseller/r.php  <-user test, pass, test
[00:58:53] <__composern> real demostration
[00:58:54] <xec> yes, you said that already
[00:59:10] <xec> but i'm not wading through an entire page of code
[01:00:01] <__composern> no i dont know what it is mean
[01:00:52] <xec> __composern: try (in css) .box { overflow: hidden; }
[01:01:42] <xec> __composern: you can read a bit here http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=6BC9D and here http://colinaarts.com/articles/the-magic-of-overflow-hidden/
[01:02:12] <__composern> xec
[01:02:18] <__composern> thank you very very much
[01:02:25] <__composern> how can i donate you ?
[01:02:55] <xec> you're welcome :) don't worry about it - i'll be happy if you just actually read the links and understand how it works
[01:04:02] <__composern> it will read it i promise
[01:06:00] <Es0teric> thisâ€¦ is
[01:06:02] <Es0teric> rediculous
[01:10:15] <xec> Es0teric: i know what you mean
[01:10:36] <Es0teric> xec lolâ€¦ i am trying to figure this problem out
[01:10:52] <Es0teric> sometimes i just want to use raw jsâ€¦ but i need jquery
[01:12:45] <Xotix> Does someone know how i can make a input filter like stackoverflow.com has it? Is there a plugin for that?
[01:13:00] <imanc1> I have several select lists and I want  hook the onchange even for each list.   Btut the only common factor is tha tthe ID has "XXX:thename"  so how do I do   $('select#XXX:*) ?
[01:14:42] <nFFF> imanc1, you can use regex with selectors I believe
[01:15:00] <nFFF> add a class to the <selects
[01:15:03] <imanc1> ahh
[01:15:07] <nFFF> and use $('select.foo')
[01:15:20] <larsemil> imanc1: $('select:' + variable)
[01:15:31] <nFFF> class's don't have to be unique
[01:16:08] <imanc1> I can just add some classes
[01:17:12] <xec> imanc1: is there a colon in the ID name?
[01:17:40] <imanc1> xec: yes that is
[01:17:59] <imanc1> name="excellence[number_of_steps]" id="excellence:number_of_steps"
[01:18:25] <Xotix> is i have the paste event, hwo do i get the pasted string?
[01:18:42] <xec> you can't select on that the normal way seing as : (and [ ]) have special meaning in css
[01:18:45] <nFFF> Xotix what are you talking about :D
[01:19:00] <xec> imanc1: maybe you can use $('[id="excellence:number_of_steps"]')
[01:19:24] <Xotix> nFFF: $(this).on('paste', '#inlineEditor', function(e) {console.log(the pasted text)});
[01:19:44] <xec> imanc1: or $('[id="excellence:' + myVar + '"]')
[01:19:52] <nFFF> xec, I think he wants to hook a change event to all the select's
[01:19:58] <imanc1> yes
[01:20:01] <nFFF> that contain excellence:*
[01:20:06] <xec> oh i see
[01:20:07] <nFFF> the best way is to add a class
[01:20:21] <nFFF> or through the selects in a container element
[01:20:21] <imanc1> this is actually a prototype issue, but #prototype is half dead
[01:20:21] <xec> imanc1: or $('[id^="excellence:"]')
[01:20:41] <xec> ^= means "starts with"
[01:20:54] <nFFF> ok that would work than :D
[01:21:02] <imanc1> nice
[01:21:10] <Xotix> imanc1 you got an wrapper? $(wrapper select) maybe?
[01:21:46] <imanc1> Xotix: aha, yes I have the form <form id="co-excellence-form" action="">
[01:22:30] <Xotix> xec one's should work or $('#co-excellence-fomr select') to get all select's within this form.
[01:22:30] <nFFF> so $("#co-excellence-form select')
[01:25:00] <imanc1> yeh
[01:25:01] <imanc1> awesome
[01:29:01] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/mmD5c/1/
[01:29:38] <aqeel> how to achieve this so if there are more links added manually will get added to jquery automagically
[01:32:42] <Xotix> How do i get the asted text from an user? If the paste event gets triggered, it must be possible to get the text which gets added.
[01:36:19] <Cork> Xotix: not supported at the moment
[01:36:36] <Mart_> hello all
[01:36:42] <Mart_> can anyone please help me?
[01:36:49] <Cork> ?ask @ Mart_
[01:36:49] <bot-t> Mart_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:37:34] <Mart_> iam using jquery mobile and using themeroller for the css. Howerver some css proporty's are not working. For example; i made the link color orange, but it keeps stock blue
[01:38:30] <Mart_> also themeroller says you have to place your custom themeroller css above the jquery structure, however if i do that it wont ork at all
[01:38:41] <Mart_> sorry for the bad english :()
[01:43:41] <aqeel> jquery uses classes thus css always comes first
[01:44:12] <aqeel> and for css u must be getting caught in inheritance.....structrue
[01:44:34] <Xotix> how can i clean up a string from it's html? so i just get the plain text? Can i use some element to clean it up?
[01:44:42] <Mart_> Ok, Iam gonna try again. Is it true that you have to place custom jquery mobile CSS BEFORE the qjuery mobile structure file? Because if i do the custom css at all
[01:45:04] <aqeel> all js after css
[01:46:14] <Mart_> mmm iam talking about jquery mobile
[01:46:27] <aqeel> same applies
[01:46:35] <aqeel> css top js bottom
[01:46:36] <Mart_> 		<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0.1/jquery.mobile-1.0.1.min.css" /> 		<link rel="stylesheet" href="themes/vsm.css" />
[01:46:42] <Mart_> yea i have that
[01:47:12] <Mart_> but i mean here - themeroller says that i have to use vsm.css (my custom css) before the jquery one
[01:47:17] <aqeel> Not Found  The requested URL /mobile/1.0.1/jquery.mobile-1.0.1.min.css" was not found on this server.
[01:47:31] <Mart_> but if i do that my custom css doesnt do anything at all?
[01:47:38] <K3|Chris|Work> anyone happens to know how to $(".ItemDiv:nth-child(6n+2), .ItemDiv:nth-child(6n+3)").appendTo($("<div class='DivBundle'>")); but make that div be in the same place as those divs where in DOM? also how to make those divs, currently just removes those elements since the divs aren't made :<
[01:47:42] <aqeel> show us your css
[01:47:56] <Mart_> ok sec
[01:48:49] <Mart_> http://jsfiddle.net/bFH2p/
[01:48:52] <Mart_> does this work?
[01:49:53] <Cork> K3|Chris|Work: sure
[01:50:08] <Mart_> anyone knows how i can turn of system msg's here?
[01:50:54] <Cork> var bundle = $("<div class='DivBundle'>"); $('.ItemDiv:nth-child(6n+2)).before(bundle); bundle.append($(".ItemDiv:nth-child(6n+2), .ItemDiv:nth-child(6n+3)"))
[01:50:59] <Cork> K3|Chris|Work: ^
[01:52:53] <aqeel> mart_ what would u like to change/
[01:54:27] <Mart_> well, iam using the jquery themeroller - and some of the proporty's i used there dont show in my mobile website- for example link color, tekst background/shadow color, icon color,
[01:55:05] <Mart_> so i must be doing something wrong- but i dont get what
[01:55:32] <aqeel> well have to cross reference your css .....just one will not be sufficce
[01:55:46] <aqeel> and how is your css order placed..
[01:56:14] <aqeel> css has a big role in placement....last order wins
[01:56:25] <Mart_> okay thanks
[01:56:31] <aqeel> if u have 2 same property the later will be applied
[01:56:39] <Mart_> okay yes! thats what i thought
[01:57:12] <Mart_> but themeroller says this what i totaly dont get: It's pretty simple: link your custom theme in the head of the page followed by the jQuery Mobile structure theme and you're ready to go.
[01:57:47] <Mart_> but when i place my custom theme after followed by the jquery mobile structure theme (css) it doesnt work at all
[01:57:53] <davidroon> Hi everybody!
[01:58:48] <aqeel> can u show your head section html
[01:59:29] <davidroon> I have an issue with ajax calls. I have a template file that contains html code and I am trying to load it through ajax. The result is that I get an error even though I get a 200 as a response. And I don't know how to check what the issue is
[02:00:43] <aqeel> ok room got to go bye
[02:01:13] <Mart_> http://jsfiddle.net/NJpKj/
[02:01:16] <Cork> davidroon: is the html file on the same domain?
[02:01:23] <coldhead> bot-t: tell aqeel I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU
[02:01:23] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[02:01:46] <davidroon> Cork: No but I get it with a GET. I just changed the dataType to "text" and now I have a new error. A bit more explicit
[02:02:03] <davidroon> it seems that it tries to parse the response as xml
[02:02:32] <Cork> davidroon: what mimetype does the server send it as=
[02:02:34] <Cork> '?
[02:02:47] <soee> hi how can i determina inside if condition if checkbox is set ?
[02:03:00] <davidroon> Cork: This I am not sure. I know you can overwrite this in jQuery so I'll try that
[02:03:14] <nFFF> if($('.foo:checked').length)
[02:03:16] <Cork> soee: $().prop('checked')
[02:03:23] <Mart_> @aqeel http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/index.php?style_id=20120308-19 this is the theme iam using
[02:03:26] <nFFF> or that ^^ :>
[02:05:06] <walidvb> hi, i want to use hashchange(use whatever is in the hash), but i don't want the browser window to scroll to there.
[02:05:12] <walidvb> how can i do that?
[02:05:33] <davidroon> Cork: I would like it to not try to do anything with the content of the response and to give it to me simply as a string
[02:05:52] <Cork> davidroon: what mimetype does the server send it as? <--
[02:06:07] <Cork> it should be text/html
[02:06:21] <Cork> if your sending application/xml that would explain your problem
[02:07:01] <davidroon> Cork: I see, I don't see any mimeType in the response header. But I have specified in the jQuery call the mimeType "text/plain"
[02:07:22] <Cork> you mean dataType ?
[02:08:53] <davidroon> Cork: I did both. dataType = text and mimeType = text/plain
[02:09:30] <Cork> that should prob work, not sure
[02:10:39] <K3|Chris|Work> Cork: doesn't work, just gives me the div in the right place, doesn't put anything inside it :\
[02:11:10] <Cork> K3|Chris|Work: if your appending the elements to it it should work fine
[02:13:06] <walidvb> how can i do that?
[02:13:08] <walidvb> hi, i want to use hashchange(use whatever is in the hash), but i don't want the browser window to scroll to there.
[02:13:17] <K3|Chris|Work> works if I do it manually in the console, but not if I leave it in the code for some reason
[02:13:46] <Cork> ?demo @ K3|Chris|Work
[02:13:47] <bot-t> K3|Chris|Work, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:15:17] <imanc1> prototype make me want to facepalm
[02:15:56] <Cork> you mean the framework prototype?
[02:17:30] <Es0teric> cork, do you know of a way to accomplish this -> http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/21/ without the cycle plugin? because the cycle plugin is NOT working the way i want it to...
[02:18:36] <Cork> you mean the text animation?
[02:18:41] <K3|Chris|Work> Cork: I guess the problem is that it occurs every 6 divs, and I have about 20, can have more, thus I have more than one "DivBundle" etc
[02:18:55] <Cork> ah
[02:18:55] <K3|Chris|Work> working on a jiddle
[02:19:03] <Cork> you can't do that

[02:19:31] <Xotix> How can i convert a document fragment to a string/html?
[02:19:32] <Cork> K3|Chris|Work: you need to create each bundle independently
[02:19:42] <Cork> imanc1: is there still ppl using that old junk?
[02:19:47] <nFFF> Is it possible to chain event binding?

[02:28:19] <osmosis_paul> or at least where it is defined?, I've see that this parameter is used internally in datatable.js but I dont know where it is filled in the datatable definition

[02:34:18] <Es0teric> how do i accomplish what .accordion() does with the anchor links in a seperate location in the page?
[02:36:17] <sweber> hi there
[02:36:28] <sweber> there is an opposite of event.preventDefault(); ?
[02:36:46] <sweber> so i can enable the defaultbehavior again?
[02:36:46] <Cork> no
[02:36:59] <sweber> :(
[02:37:08] <neil> Hey I am working on jquery from within JSP and have an array of users, each user has a button and I want the button to toggle a table's visibility, I imagine this is possible but I am unsure of the syntax, can someone help?
[02:37:13] <redeeman> hello, I have a checkbox that i bind to with .change(), and then somewhere else i alter the checkbox with .prop('checked', true), and it does check, but the bind to .change() does not fire, is there a way to make it do that?
[02:37:32] <martisj> can i use the shorthand background attribute when setting the .css() of a DOM element?
[02:37:51] <Cork> no
[02:38:00] <martisj> okay.. hmm
[02:38:09] * Cork feels repetiv...
[02:38:44] <Es0teric> this is driving me insane
[02:38:53] <Cork> martisj: .css is just a wrapper around .style
[02:39:00] <martisj> Cork: thanks
[02:39:37] <martisj> oh okay so its overriding what's in the css file then?
[02:39:47] <Cork> its inline css
[02:39:51] <neil> I apologise for the state of the code it's was written by someone else and it's my job to clean it up etc
[02:39:59] <martisj> Cork: yepp thanks!!
[02:40:07] <neil> http://pastebin.ca/2126087
[02:40:10] <martisj> Cork: i.e. higher precedence
[02:40:21] * Cork nods
[02:40:35] <Es0teric> .accordion() with external control?
[02:42:30] <soee> how can i hide each div with class X inside some container ?
[02:43:12] <imanc1> $('#container div.x').hide(); ?
[02:43:19] <walidvb> i want to use hashchange(use whatever is in the hash), but i don't want the browser window to scroll to there.
[02:43:31] <walidvb> anyone knows how to achieve that?
[02:44:01] <walidvb> i use the hashchange plugin to use the hash, but i don't want any scrolling anywhere
[02:44:46] <Cork> walidvb: only way would be to either block the hash form getting into the urlbar
[02:44:52] <Cork> or make sure the id isn't in the page
[02:45:02] <walidvb> Cork: well i do want it in the url
[02:45:13] <Cork> then you have option 2 left
[02:45:16] <walidvb> cause it opens the div with corresponding id
[02:45:33] <walidvb> but i could put it as a class instead.. i guess that would solve my problem?
[02:45:54] <walidvb> (i use it as permalink, kind of)
[02:45:57] <Cork> browser only looks for id attributes when matching hashes yes
[02:46:57] <walidvb> Cork: so that would be the solution.. and it's really not so dirty
[02:47:11] <Cork> uh.. you just said it
[02:47:35] <Cork> if you don't want the browser to match a hash to id, don't use that id
[02:48:53] <neil> Can anyone help me with the code: http://pastebin.ca/2126087
[02:48:55] <neil> ?
[02:49:17] <Es0teric> question $('#divcontainer').accordion({header: '.divclass' }); <-- is that valid?
[02:52:13] <rabbi1> how can i add CSS styles to "<input type="checkbox" id="check" /><label for="check">Toggle</label>" ?
[02:52:50] <rabbi1> #check label {} doesn't work :(
[02:53:21] <osmosis_paul> someone know about iDisplayStart in datatables??
[02:53:37] <Cork> rabbi1: #check + lable
[02:53:39] <sjeijk> guys I'm trying to make a script that changes the image folder according to the resolutions i have set up, it's working almost fine except for 1 small detail and that is that i don't know how to restore the path name when there are subfolder, tips are appreciated http://jsfiddle.net/jBxws/8/
[02:53:42] <Cork> *label
[02:55:22] <rabbi1> Cork: works with ie ? wow thanks
[02:55:41] <Cork> rabbi1: ie>6 yes

[03:07:29] <c0d3rg1rl> Hello, shot question: How can I detect with jQuery if an input-text-element is onscreen or offscreen in the visible browser window? I want to .focus() it, but only if the user really can see it.

[03:18:13] <Milossh> hey; I have a problem defining variables. foo = {}; foo.bar = []; doesn't work
[03:18:35] <Milossh> var foo = {}; var foo.bar = [];
[03:18:37] <Milossh> that is
[03:18:56] <Milossh> var foo.bar - missing ; before statement
[03:19:13] <imanc1> Milossh:   var foo['bar'] =
[03:19:18] <imanc1> ignore the va
[03:19:19] <imanc1> var
[03:19:26] <imanc1> foo['bar'] =
[03:19:31] <Milossh> I can do that on objects?
[03:19:44] <imanc1> Milossh: you can access them either way.  Weird I know
[03:20:36] <Milossh> so, given "var foo = {};", I can do "foo['bar'] = 'foobar';"  and then access "foo.bar" and get value "foobar"?
[03:20:38] <Krinkle> Milossh: use 'var' to create a new variable, then get/set members via dot notation
[03:20:54] <Krinkle> you only need to use foo[..] if you key is a variable
[03:21:17] <Krinkle> e.g. var foo = { bar: 100 }; var key = 'bar'; alert( foo[ key ] );
[03:21:29] <Krinkle> otherwise foo.bar is easier :)
[03:22:13] <Milossh> Krinkle: ok, so let me describe a problem. I want to have object foo, and a child bar that's and array
[03:22:14] <Krinkle> Milossh: yes, exactly
[03:22:16] <Milossh> how'd I do that?
[03:22:26] <Krinkle> just do
[03:22:56] <Krinkle> var foo = {}; foo.bar = ['apple', 'banana', 'citron'];
[03:23:06] <Milossh> oh, so no var before? nice
[03:23:08] <Milossh> thanks
[03:23:12] <Krinkle> no, var only for new variables
[03:23:19] <Krinkle> bar is not a variable but an object member
[03:23:20] <sjeijk> in a path for example some/path/to/file/image.jpg how do I extract the string after the 2nd / divider? so ill keep /to/file/image.jpg
[03:23:36] <Krinkle> Milossh: If this is all in the same code, you can also extend the object literal
[03:23:52] <Krinkle> Milossh: var foo = { bar: ['apple', 'banana',
[03:23:56] <Krinkle> Milossh: var foo = { bar: ['apple', 'banana', 'citron
[03:24:00] <Krinkle> Milossh: var foo = { bar: ['apple', 'banana', 'citron'] };
[03:24:07] <Krinkle> (sorry, return key is angry)
[03:24:10] <walidvb> i get a weird error that i really don't understand using closest or parent. illegal invocation.. anyone care to take a quick look? :)
[03:24:49] <Krinkle> walidvb: just post the link, someone will look
[03:25:17] <walidvb> oh sry forgot the link ^^ www.plak.vbbros.net
[03:25:30] <walidvb> if you open a release, and try to close it again
[03:25:41] <walidvb> i do the following:
[03:25:44] <walidvb> 	var trigger = $(".trigger");
[03:25:44] <walidvb> 	  trigger.click(function(e) {
[03:25:44] <walidvb> 		console.log($(this));
[03:25:46] <walidvb> 		var dad = $(this).closest(".openable");
[03:25:48] <walidvb> 		console.log(dad);
[03:25:50] <walidvb> 			var isOpen = dad.hasClass('open');
[03:25:52] <walidvb> 			if(isOpen)
[03:25:54] <walidvb> 			{
[03:25:56] <walidvb> 				e.preventDefault();		
[03:25:58] <walidvb> 				dad.removeClass(open);
[03:26:00] <walidvb> 			}
[03:26:00] <Milossh> and how do I pop the last element in an array?
[03:26:01] <Krinkle> walidvb: Don't paste here
[03:26:02] <walidvb> 			
[03:26:04] <walidvb> 	   });
[03:26:06] <walidvb> argh sry again... :(
[03:26:09] <Milossh> array[:-1]?
[03:26:09] <Krinkle> walidvb:                 $('.' + target).addClass('open');
[03:26:18] <walidvb> Krinkle: yes i know, wrong click
[03:26:25] <Krinkle> walidvb: that line is throwing an illegal selector exception
[03:27:04] <Krinkle> walidvb: you have to verify that target.length > 2 && target[0] === '#', before you do that
[03:27:10] <Krinkle> $('.') doesn't work
[03:27:17] <walidvb> Krinkle: hm but opening works.. i mean, that line doesn't throw an error, does it?
[03:27:21] <Krinkle> it does
[03:27:26] <Krinkle> > http://www.plak.vbbros.net/
[03:27:31] <Krinkle> < Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .
[03:27:50] <Krinkle> ?debug
[03:27:57] <walidvb> Krinkle: hm i don't get that error..
[03:28:11] <walidvb> oh now i do.
[03:28:13] <Krinkle> walidvb: Where are you looking? what browser? which debugging tools
[03:28:36] <walidvb> chrome, but i was always loading a link like http://vbbros.net/plak/catalog#PLKLP001
[03:28:39] <Krinkle> ok
[03:28:41] <walidvb> which doesn't return an error
[03:28:45] <Krinkle> indeed
[03:29:08] <Krinkle> walidvb: so where is this illegal invocation happening?
[03:29:20] <walidvb> when you try to close a release
[03:29:54] <walidvb> (click again on the cover)
[03:30:38] <Milossh> array.pop should remove the last element of an array, right?
[03:30:51] <Milossh> array.pop(); that is
[03:32:11] <Krinkle> Milossh: yes
[03:32:15] <Krinkle> ?mdn array op
[03:32:15] <caniuse> Krinkle: Proxy - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy
[03:32:18] <Krinkle> ?mdn array pop
[03:32:18] <caniuse> Krinkle: pop - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop
[03:33:13] <walidvb> Krinkle: see anything wrong?
[03:33:20] <Krinkle> walidvb: no
[03:33:38] <Krinkle> the image scrolls up
[03:33:40] <walidvb> Krinkle: haha
[03:33:41] <walidvb> argh
[03:33:44] <Krinkle> and leaves a blank whole
[03:33:47] <Krinkle> what is supposed to happen?
[03:34:12] <Krinkle> Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[03:34:14] <Krinkle> ah, there it is
[03:34:17] <Krinkle> it had a little delay
[03:34:44] <walidvb> it's supposed to remove the open class from the parent openable
[03:34:52] <walidvb> ie. close the release again
[03:35:11] <Krinkle> ok
[03:35:21] <walidvb> it works with the div parent to openable, .views-row for some reason..
[03:35:50] <Krinkle> walidvb: Too much code, try to reproduce in a simple environment
[03:35:54] <Krinkle> ?jsbin
[03:36:15] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/
[03:36:34] <walidvb> Krinkle: i did, and it works.. it seems it's only the fact that i try to go for 'openable' that crashes it...
[03:36:54] <Krinkle> can you reproduce crash on jsfiddle?
[03:38:44] <jita> How can i make fancybox to appear like this http://i.imgur.com/uSDnx.png ?
[03:38:49] <jita> and not as a modal window ?
[03:39:07] <walidvb> hmm... working now..
[03:39:14] <walidvb> Krinkle: no i couldn't
[03:39:15] <Taloncor> It is possible to use the serializeArray() function to serialize forms with file-input fields?
[03:39:29] <jita> positioned just beneath the button it is clickon on
[03:39:38] <walidvb> i tried making tests, and going back to the original code works.
[03:39:44] <walidvb> next step ;)
[03:39:46] <walidvb> thanks Krinkle
[03:39:57] <Krinkle> you're welcome
[03:40:24] <ShawnRisk> is there a way I can use jQuery 1.2.3 for this code: $(function() { $('#addshow').on('click', function() { $('.uc-price-display').toggle(); $('.attributes').toggle(); $('.node-add-to-cart').toggle(); }); });?  Right now, I am using jQuery 1.7.1, but want to see if I can backport this
[03:48:29] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[03:48:52] <Double_Rainbow> i have a bunch of select boxes with class even_change
[03:48:53] <imanc1> hello Double_Rainbow, from world
[03:49:11] <Double_Rainbow> how do i get the value of the currently selected option ?
[03:49:42] <imanc1> Double_Rainbow: from inside a click handler or something?
[03:50:36] <Double_Rainbow> nah its ok, it solved itself
[03:50:39] <Double_Rainbow> thanks
[03:50:52] <imanc1> awesome
[03:53:01] <ShawnRisk> is there a way I can use jQuery 1.2.3 for this code: $(function() { $('#addshow').on('click', function() { $('.uc-price-display').toggle(); $('.attributes').toggle(); $('.node-add-to-cart').toggle(); }); });? Â Right now, I am using jQuery 1.7.1, but want to see if I can backport this
[03:53:53] <imanc1> ShawnRisk: how does it fail on 1.2.3?
[03:54:16] <ShawnRisk> imanc1: let me try one more time to tell you
[03:54:58] <Cork> ShawnRisk: replace on with bind
[03:55:30] <ShawnRisk> I get this error: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('#addshow').on')
[03:55:32] <Cork> uh.. 1.2.3? your sure you didn't mean 1.3.2?
[03:55:44] <Cork> ShawnRisk: replace on with bind <--
[03:55:57] <ShawnRisk> Cork: just saw that, will try that
[03:56:06] <ShawnRisk> Cork: yes I mean 1.2.3
[03:56:35] <Cork> $( was added somewhere in 1.3 so you prob need to replace $( with $(document).ready
[03:56:46] <aaairc> if i put a â†’ character in my urls would that be bad practice?
[03:57:02] <Cork> aaairc: as long as you url encode it nope
[03:57:03] <aaairc> i have a generated URL that looks like myapp.com/sortby-aâ†’z
[03:57:36] <Cork> aaairc: if you encode it to %E2%86%92 its fine
[03:57:43] <Cork> else no, its not ok
[03:57:59] <aaairc> like if i go to my browser, the url currently looks like this "www.myapp.com/sortby-aâ†’z"
[03:58:16] <Cork> ya, but the browser url decodes that
[03:58:31] <Cork> what you put into the urls should be encoded
[03:58:31] <aaairc> instead your saying it should look like:   "www.myapp.com/sortby-%E2%86%92
[03:58:39] <Cork> no
[03:58:43] <Cork> read again
[03:58:48] <aaairc> ok
[03:59:07] <aaairc> do you know if it would be bad for SEO?
[03:59:07] <ShawnRisk> Cork: like this: $(document).ready(function() { ?
[03:59:22] <aaairc> if i'm able to url encode it?
[03:59:49] <ShawnRisk> Cork: that worked out
[03:59:51] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[04:03:34] <Martz_> Can anyone help me? I am making a mobile website. And when i click a div, i want to change the background of the div (i got so far), but then when someone clicks again i want the old background back. I have this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/fR7My/
[04:04:27] <Cork> Martin_: use a class
[04:04:52] <Cork> sorry Martz_
[04:05:00] <Cork> ?.toggleClass @ Martz_
[04:05:23] <Milossh> hey; I have var mystring = "[foo][bar] some random text". How do I split it so that I get ['foo', 'bar'] and the rest of it in var?
[04:05:49] <Milossh> I figured I split by space first, but what then?
[04:05:54] <Cork> Milossh: regex
[04:06:13] <Milossh> Cork: not sure if I can pull anything off using regex
[04:06:26] <Martz_> @Cork, thanks but i dont understand how to make that i think, but gimme a min i'll try :P
[04:06:50] <Whirl3dOrd3r> I can't think this am, so if someone could help: In phtoshop, when you select a color it looks likeL  #7668s8d. how do I generate a background color from that number?
[04:11:18] <Martz_> @Cork thanks! I have it working now!
[04:13:17] <nFFF> Milossh
[04:13:19] <nFFF> try: ^\[(.*)](.*)
[04:13:49] <nFFF> but wait that might match also 'foo][bar'
[04:14:01] <Martz_> Whirl3dOrd3r: background-color: #number;?
[04:14:30] <Whirl3dOrd3r> they are all coming out black
[04:15:06] <Martz_> are you sure you have the right color code?
[04:15:30] <Whirl3dOrd3r> It looks as though they might have gotten munged up in mySql
[04:15:41] <Martz_> mmm lemme check
[04:16:10] <Martz_> its not a right color code
[04:16:43] <ThemNuts> sup, i got this little script to complete a url before visiting it. Now, when the var is loaded in the input (say when i edit the company) and i press the generated link, it takes the var. What i'd like is that i can get the correct link when putting in a new company (on empty input) and it fetches the value of the submition before posting it. http://pastebin.com/3hYLuFQh
[04:17:47] <c0d3rg1rl> Whirl3dOrd3r: compare your code to this example: http://jsfiddle.net/s5dwq/
[04:18:58] <Martz_> anyone knows how i can turn of the system msges from mirc off? Like when someone joins or leaves?
[04:20:28] <c0d3rg1rl> Martz_: Tools -> Options -> IRC -> Options -> Show -> Uncheck "Show joins/parts"
[04:22:21] <Whirl3dOrd3r> c0d3rg1rl, Martz_, thanks for the replies. I think my numbers got changed in sql...not sure why. Here's what I am trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/s5dwq/1/
[04:22:41] <cwalkdawg> "/ignore -channels #mwsf * JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS"
[04:25:19] <Martz_> c0d3rg1rl: thanks
[04:28:45] <Martz_> MMMMM i have this strange problem. Iam making a mobile site with jquery mobile- and for some reason i cant css <a> tags. It keeps being the default blue color, anyone reconise this 'bug'?
[04:29:01] <Martz_> And i can change all other kind of tags
[04:30:11] <Cork> Martz_: sounds like your either useing invalid css or you have a css rule that overides your rule
[04:30:59] <Martz_> yea thats what i thought, iam having 3 css files, and in the last file i change the A tag, but it just doesnt work, and when i change the ccs to P f.e. it does work
[04:31:19] <Cork> you have a link?
[04:32:17] <Martz_> i dont have it online yet, but gimme a sec
[04:33:15] <Martz_> just a random other quest first, does it matter if you type <a   > vs <a>?
[04:33:32] <Cork> in the html?
[04:33:35] <Cork> no
[04:33:58] <Cork> < a> matters though
[04:34:55] <Martz_> okay!
[04:35:02] <Martz_> gonna check if i made some mistakes first then
[04:36:46] <Martz_> mmmm it does work in Internet explorer
[04:36:50] <Martz_> (and doesnt work in chrome)
[04:37:53] <AdvoWork> I'm doing:  $(document).delegate(".edit_vendor_item", "click", function(event) {  and within that:  $("#somediv").load('editing.php?product_id='+ product_id + '&customerid='+customerid).dialog({ ...} but on some occasions, it loads 2 dialog windows. I do alert($("#somediv").length) to see if it already exists and it says 0 before it opens.Any ideas please?
[04:38:55] <Cork> AdvoWork: you can't chain selectors on load
[04:39:02] <Cork> AdvoWork: you need to use the callback
[04:39:45] <AdvoWork> Cork, how come it works though? i mean, ive done a fair few of these and they appear to work, its just this one, or do you mean, it will work just not properly?
[04:40:01] <Cork> AdvoWork: its racy
[04:40:02] <Ratchet486> ?foreach
[04:40:03] <bot-t> Ratchet486, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[04:40:09] <Cork> it works if the content is in cache
[04:40:25] <Cork> AdvoWork: load triggers an ajax call, and thats async
[04:40:30] <AdvoWork> Cork, doh! got a code example at all? or is it literally the callback of load() thats needed?
[04:40:41] <Cork> ?.load
[04:40:42] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/

[04:41:13] <Cork> AdvoWork: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[04:41:19] <Cork> the "complete" argument
[04:42:49] <Cork> AdvoWork: what your chaining after load should happen inside that function
[04:42:58] <Cork> and you should be safe
[04:43:29] <mikkelb> anyway later guys.. thanks for the help.. im gonna grab a beer and listen to http://traffic.libsyn.com/thechamps/Sasha_GreyFlying_Lotus_Part_1_Output.mp3
[04:44:08] <AdvoWork> Cork, this is what i'm doing: http://jsfiddle.net/fRCqH/ do you mean i need to call my dialog after that or?
[04:45:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/fRCqH/1/
[04:46:10] <Martz_> @Cork i found the prob, i didnt edit the 'visited color' yet lol
[04:46:24] <Martz_> thanks for sending me in the right direction again :)
[04:46:29] <Cork> :)
[04:47:10] <Martz_> i love how google chrome makes you see all proporties and what overwrites what
[04:48:32] <Cork> Martin_: all browsers does that actually
[04:48:35] <Cork> even ie does that
[04:48:40] <AdvoWork> Cork, ok, i've changed that but in some instances it's still opening 2 dialogs, of the same page
[04:48:43] <Martz_> oh lol, didnt knew that haha
[04:49:01] <Cork> Martin_: was inverted by the firebug team though :)
[04:49:52] <Cork> AdvoWork: your sure your not doing two ajax calls?
[04:51:12] <AdvoWork> no, just the one, it doesn't do it every time. Its not because i've got selector.load  and then thesameselector.dialog ?
[04:52:23] <Gaia> hey guys, my jquery doesnt load on my website

[04:58:03] <AdvoWork> Cork, basically, if i click the link, it opens the dialog, if i close it, click it again, it opens 1 again, i can repeat all day, but as soon as I click on another link to reopen the page i'm on, and then do it, it opens 2 dialogs, any suggestions?
[04:58:04] <Gaia> sorry
[04:58:08] <Gaia> cork
[04:58:14] <GozzyX> sorry Cork
[04:58:30] <GozzyX> Gaia im looking at the code inside elitel.nl
[04:58:36] <Gaia> yeah
[04:58:40] <Gaia> i noticed that also
[04:58:48] <Gaia> there are things missing
[04:59:09] <Gaia> the code i pasted on pastebin is the code i got
[04:59:12] <Cork> AdvoWork: not ofhand no, sounds like your leaving something behind, not sure what though

[05:00:29] <softmanpetro> hi all ! I try to make a video gallery with fancybox.net but I always get 1 video only and now next or previous buttons ! Any hint please ?
[05:00:41] <Gaia> Cork , seems like you know a thing or 2 about jquery
[05:00:52] <Gaia> would you mind looking at my code for a sec?
[05:01:22] <GozzyX> Gaia never seen an assignemnt like this: var active=root=$('#toplayer');
[05:02:36] <Cork> hmm that IS neet... >_>
[05:02:37] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/A6cR5/
[05:03:18] <Gaia> hmmz ok
[05:03:36] <Gaia> well GozzyX , that the argument that shows my jquery......i guess... :>
[05:04:04] <Gaia> is from the templatesystem the site uses
[05:04:50] <blendedbychris> is there a function to animate a height resize?
[05:05:27] <Whirl3dOrd3r> $(".someClass.active,.someClass").first() would problemm work., huh?
[05:05:41] <Gaia> i deleted it now GozzyX , and put in my html Cloud();
[05:05:47] <Gaia> and that also works
[05:05:49] <blendedbychris> $(this).closest(".video-entry").find(".video").show().animate("height: 474px");
[05:05:52] <blendedbychris> something like that?
[05:06:38] <Gozzy> Gaia can you update the jsfiddle?
[05:07:02] <blendedbychris> oh wait i got it :)
[05:10:52] <Gaia> whats that jsfiddle?
[05:11:33] <iLike> it's an online environment to test, share and run javascript snippets/files Gaia
[05:11:47] <kevindougans> jsfiddle is amazing
[05:12:23] <Gaia> hmmz ok
[05:12:23] <iLike> that it is
[05:12:26] <Gaia> well i updated it
[05:12:42] <Gaia> http://jsfiddle.net/A6cR5/
[05:12:46] <Gaia> is that correct
[05:13:00] <soee> any idea why for this: $('#check_uid7_0:checked') firefox returns true even if checkbox isnt checked?
[05:13:04] <kevindougans> i was sure in my complex site jsfiddle was never gonna work
[05:13:07] <kevindougans> but it did
[05:13:08] <kevindougans> first time
[05:13:09] <elfrancesco> hi
[05:13:16] <kevindougans> hi
[05:14:36] <elfrancesco> i am encoutering problems with multiple loading of jquery. I know about the jQuery.noConflict() function i was wondering if there is a sort of stack / history variable in which jquery store a copy of the last version that was loaded before please ?
[05:15:02] <blendedbychris> would you guys suggest using this http://code.google.com/p/jquery-oembed/
[05:16:48] <Gaia> ffs
[05:16:54] <Gaia> getting realy fustrated here
[05:17:35] <Gaia> anyone how can fix my problem! ill give them cookies! LOADS OF COOKIES!
[05:17:38] <blendedbychris> bleh
[05:18:35] <Gaia> http://jsfiddle.net/A6cR5/
[05:18:47] <Gaia> it does something in that results thing
[05:26:04] <Whirl3dOrd3r> there has got to be an easy way to start from the beginning of a collection if you are iterating through the elements using .next...
[05:27:33] <Whirl3dOrd3r> preferably something nicer that var nxt=$(".class".next(); if (!nxt.length) {nxt=$(".class").first())}
[05:28:22] <Gaia> Hey guys, here is my problem
[05:28:26] <Gaia> This is the banner i made
[05:28:27] <Gaia> http://vrijegeesten.com/test/banner.html
[05:28:39] <Gaia> and it doesnt work on my site: www.elitel.nl
[05:28:44] <Gaia> and this is my code
[05:29:26] <Gaia> http://pastebin.com/QPGMqrUk
[05:29:32] <Gaia> can anyone help me with it
[05:39:51] <raver> hi... noob here.. why does this: <script..>function showEntries(id) {	$('#entry_table_'id).show(); }</script> trigger automatically instead of when clicking <a onclick="javascript:showEntries(1)" href="#">1  entry found</a> ?
[05:40:52] <djcoin> Hi all. I have a question regarding the 'change' event and multiple select. Is there a way to know which item gets removed or added ?
[05:43:50] <GLaDOSv2> hi guys, I'm trying to create a tinyMCE plugin that simply adds a span with a specific, pre-defined class around text, but I don't really see how to do that - can anybody help me out?
[05:44:06] <GLaDOSv2> damn, wrong channel I guess
[05:45:32] <iman> how can I stop all javascript progress in jquery when I call a function ?
[05:45:43] <iman> $('html).stop(); ?
[05:53:42] <AdvoWork> On click of an element I am loading an url, and from that showing the content of that in a dialog. This works fine, i can re open as many times as I like. If I click off the page and back onto it, and try again, it duplicates/shows me 2 dialogs. I've done if the length of the id < 1 open the dialog to hopefully catch/stop it opening 2 but it fails, i've just put something on the page to show the time of page load and the 2 dialogs show different
[05:53:42] <AdvoWork>  times, so must be being loaded at a different time, yet how, there is only one call to load and dialog? Code sample: http://pastebin.com/49XntxKL
[05:54:41] <DEac-> hi
[05:56:16] <DEac-> i have an div and i a click-event on it. in this div, there are many other elements and if there is an other click event, the div-click-event should not be called. how i can do that?
[05:56:33] <DEac-> the other click-events can't prevent default
[06:01:53] <__composern> is there any option in javascript for debugging ?
[06:02:23] <Gozzy> Gaia the code on elitel does not match the code on pastebin, still missing accolades
[06:02:45] <Gaia> gozzy
[06:02:47] <Gaia> like i said
[06:02:55] <Gaia> the code i got , has the accolades
[06:03:08] <Gaia> the site freaking doesnt read them!@
[06:03:39] <AdvoWork> how can i count the number of elements with a certain number set for data-item_id ? ie i know the id is 10, so i want to see how many selectors I have with that data attribute and that value?
[06:03:44] <Gozzy> it doesnt output them you mean.. javascript is pretty strict you cant just leave out some accolades
[06:03:48] <Gaia> yeah
[06:03:51] <SmartTowel> what's the best way to build a calender (with the feature to add appointments) using the datepicker jquery calendar?
[06:03:59] <Gaia> the error lies here
[06:04:06] <Gaia> $(document).ready(function() {	var timer;
[06:04:21] <Gaia> since he doesnt output the { , my var is the error
[06:04:46] <Gozzy> jup the occolade is really important..
[06:04:47] <Gaia> and if the var doesnt ready, nothing reads :[
[06:04:59] <Gaia> dat snap ik
[06:05:03] <Gaia> ik heb hem er ook fakking in!
[06:05:10] <Gaia> maar hoezo haalt de browser5 hem weg!
[06:05:13] <Gozzy> english ;)
[06:05:22] <Gaia> doesnt make any sense!
[06:05:26] <Gaia> :@
[06:05:36] <Gozzy> the browser does not remove it your parser does, internet explorer reads it the same as firefox
[06:05:41] <Gozzy> its something serverside
[06:06:00] <AdvoWork> i've tried $('*[data-vendor_item_id='+vendor_item_id +'+]').length  which fails
[06:06:02] <Gozzy> what you can do to make it easier is put all the javascript inside a js file
[06:06:12] <Gozzy> and reference it, thats neater too
[06:06:42] <Gozzy> > cleaner
[06:07:13] <Gaia> hmmz
[06:07:15] <Gaia> ill try that
[06:07:49] <Gozzy> just dump the js from http://vrijegeesten.com/test/banner.html inside a .js
[06:10:47] <AdvoWork> urgh, even $('[data-vendor_item_id=1]').length doesn't work, any suggestions? can't see another way to do it
[06:10:48] <Gozzy> btw <iframe class="GoogleMaps" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="scripts/Contact.html" name="maps"/><p>Uw webbrowser ondersteunt geen iFrames</p></iframe/></div> is not correct. iframe is not an empty element so its ...name="maps"> not ...name="maps"/>
[06:11:53] <__composern> there is a problem in jquery top_up plugin [ probably my bad ] function is works when  click the link two or more times, but orginally function must be work in one click
[06:12:08] <__composern> how can i debug this function ?
[06:12:13] <Gaia> Gozzy
[06:12:16] <__composern> or library
[06:12:16] <Gaia> http://pastebin.com/5Jt3U1T6
[06:12:26] <Gaia> this is my code from banner.js
[06:12:33] <Gozzy> hmm
[06:12:37] <Gaia> Now it gives an error @ line 1. $
[06:12:38] <Gaia> :/
[06:13:06] <Gaia> and still the { is gone
[06:17:29] <Alex577> hi. how could i check, if a listelement is the nth child of something? http://codepaste.net/iqi2my
[06:18:19] <SmartTowel> Alex577: http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[06:18:33] <Gozzy> Gaia btw the missing accolades is still something i would look into; really weird for a backend to remove m
[06:19:16] <Gaia> indeed
[06:20:27] <AdvoWork> what could possibly cause alert to fire once, then again, just by doing: $(document).delegate(".edit_vendor_item", "click", function(event) {event.preventDefault(); alert("test");  even though it was 100% only clicked once?
[06:21:55] <Alex577> SmartTowel: I made a click before this condition
[06:22:01] <Gozzy> a .edit_vendor_item inside a .edit_vendor_item? (guessing here)
[06:22:17] <eworbit> Hi.   Is there a way to append text to all links in a page?   I tried this   $('a').after(" >>");   but unfortunately it adds the arrows on the outside of the anchors - not within the anchors like I anticipated.
[06:22:45] <SmartTowel> Alex577: try using is()
[06:22:52] <nFFF> $('a').text('') eworbit
[06:23:03] <Es0teric> how do i check if the previous list item has a certain class?
[06:23:05] <SmartTowel> http://api.jquery.com/is/
[06:23:14] <Es0teric> more specifically the previously clicked item
[06:23:15] <nFFF> although that will replace it
[06:23:24] <eworbit> $('a').text only replace's  not appends....
[06:23:34] <Alex577> SmartTowel: that the code: http://codepaste.net/xcw8vd
[06:23:47] <SmartTowel> Es0teric: you can use data array to store info about an element.
[06:23:58] <nFFF> ?append @ eworbit
[06:23:58] <bot-t> eworbit, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[06:24:05] <Gozzy> AdvoWork alert the html inside it so you know.. instead of alert('alert') do alert($(this).html());
[06:24:09] <SmartTowel> so when its clicked, set a flag (ex. lastClicked => yes)
[06:24:19] <SmartTowel> and use hasClass() to check if the element has a class.
[06:24:25] <nFFF> just ntoiced you were using .after() not append()
[06:24:34] <eworbit> geesh... append works.  I must have missed that.  Thanks.
[06:25:00] <Es0teric> SmartTowel, i have this -> http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/42/show/ but everytime click on a icon proj, it keeps the current class on the previous <li> i want to remove that and keep the current one with that border
[06:25:39] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, alert($(this).html()); just shows Edit, and then Edit again as its a hyperlink i'm clicking
[06:26:01] <Gozzy> can you put it on jsfiddle?
[06:26:05] <SmartTowel> Es0teric: use a combination of ids and classes.
[06:26:26] <Es0teric> SmartTowel, did you see my fiddle?
[06:26:29] <SmartTowel> when you click on the element u want, it will remove the class from all, and set it for the element with the id.
[06:26:53] <SmartTowel> Es0teric: can i see the fork? i only see the result.
[06:26:59] <Es0teric> dude
[06:27:08] <SmartTowel> nm, got it.
[06:27:09] <Es0teric> SmartTowel, just remove the word "show" from the url
[06:27:12] <Es0teric> lol
[06:27:28] <SmartTowel> ive only used fiddle this way, not the other way.
[06:27:34] <Es0teric> oh
[06:28:45] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, the code is http://jsfiddle.net/fRCqH/2/  it works fine, til i click off the page(on a link to reload that current page) then it begins duplicating stuff
[06:30:01] <Gozzy> sounds like $(document).delegate(".edit_vendor_item", "click", function(event) { is excecuted twice
[06:30:32] <Gozzy> but i dont even know if that causes it to be excecuted twice
[06:30:55] <Gozzy> not that hard to test though :)
[06:31:41] <__composern> or library
[06:31:48] <AdvoWork> well, the alert is within that, so it must be? how else can I test it Gozzy
[06:31:53] <__composern> there is a problem in jquery top_up plugin [ probably my bad ] function is works when click the link two or more times, but orginally function must be work in one click
[06:33:16] <Gozzy> i just tested it http://jsfiddle.net/fRCqH/3/ it does excecute twice (makes sence) so there it probally a page with a javascript include which calls the delegate again
[06:33:23] <__composern> how can i see what is the problem source ? [ console.log catch nothing )
[06:33:40] <Alex577> SmartTowel: Could you give an example, pls? I don't get it to work. Sry
[06:33:57] <SmartTowel> yea, one sec.
[06:34:51] <PressedWeb> Anyone know modernizr? I can't figure out how to use it to call basic alerts on a yepnope: http://jsfiddle.net/6wmDP/
[06:34:56] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, sorry to be simple, does that mean theres another page with that same bit of code? or do you mean a duplicate element, because its a class there are numerous <a hrefs with that class name
[06:35:15] <Gozzy> no i mean a page with the same javascript include
[06:36:05] <Gozzy> a page with <head><script src="YourJsWhichSetsUpTheDelegate.js"></script></head>
[06:36:53] <Xotix> does the file input block uploading the same file one after another
[06:37:59] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, can i test for that somehow? I don't think its the case as I have one page open, and I basically load all other pages into a div, like: $("#column").load(/myurl/mypage);  so the first time I do that, it works fine, i click the link which calls $("#column").load(/myurl/mypage); again, and it should overwrite, this is where it starts duplicating
[06:39:36] <Godfather_> hi, i have a span.click that fadeOut() a div and then fadeIn other div, the problem is that when i click this span the page scrolls up,  the sumary of the code is this http://jsfiddle.net/9pH8K/
[06:39:55] <Gozzy> AdvoWork its a dirty fix but i think if you call undelegate before delegate your in the clear http://jsfiddle.net/fRCqH/4/
[06:39:57] <Godfather_> i tried changing the <span element to <a href="#" but continues scrollup the page
[06:40:12] <walidvb> hello ppl, i have big problems understanding smth that is wrong with my site... www.plak.vbbros.net
[06:40:17] <SmartTowel> es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/53/
[06:40:21] <walidvb> if you go to blog
[06:40:52] <walidvb> when you open two blog items,, the last one goes to the next line.
[06:40:57] <Es0teric> SmartTowel, dude what did you do?
[06:41:12] <Godfather_> i have this problem here, http://albertanglada.es/   when you click on 'ULTIMAS AÑADIDAS' or 'POPULARES'
[06:41:13] <Gozzy> AdvoWork /myurl/mypage has javascript inside it?
[06:41:22] <Godfather_> misteriously the page scrolls up
[06:41:52] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, yeah it does, so the first time it works, and the 2nd time its like it exists twice?
[06:42:17] <walidvb> on click, i change the size of the container div by the size of what i add to the content
[06:42:46] <Godfather_> i tried also e.preventDefault but doesnt work
[06:42:52] <walidvb> ok what i'm trying to say is that it works on another page, and that it should, but i've spent the last 4 hours on that with no solution..
[06:43:14] <SmartTowel> Es0teric, that's how u would have the classes only follow that element that u clicked, instead of staying on all of them.
[06:43:25] <__composern> Godfather_: [15:43:11.444] GET http://albertanglada.es/jwplayer/player.swf [HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified 749ms]
[06:43:27] <Gozzy> AdvoWork is the site live? (can i take a look)
[06:43:30] <SmartTowel> you'll have to intergrate it into ur stuff on ur own, that's just how it would be done.
[06:43:34] <__composern> [15:43:12.484] GET http://ofertasybonos.com/crossdomain.xml [HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found 2225ms]
[06:43:35] <Es0teric> SmartTowel but you commented out the prev codeâ€¦ i was trying to do it INSIDE the other code
[06:44:08] <SmartTowel> you can just move my stuff up into ur code, i just was trying to show u the selectors u needed to get it working.
[06:44:57] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, its internal unfortunately,which is a pain in the arse
[06:45:18] <Godfather_> __composern, so??
[06:45:36] <Gozzy> did you try to call undelegate before delegate?
[06:45:44] <Es0teric> SmartTowel yeah that works.. thanks
[06:45:49] <Gozzy> like http://jsfiddle.net/fRCqH/4/
[06:45:53] <Godfather_> __composern, [HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified 749ms] what means this?
[06:45:56] <SmartTowel> no problemo.
[06:46:17] <SmartTowel> Alex577: u still here?
[06:46:45] <Alex577> sure. still waiting :D

[06:47:12] <SmartTowel> can u send me the pastebin agian plz.
[06:47:22] <Godfather_> __composern, can you re-do this? i dont know where i load crossdomail.xml on my project
[06:47:29] <Godfather_> i searched for this with no  result
[06:47:46] <Godfather_> i removed an image that i was loading             image:'http://ofertasybonos.com/images/pizarra.png',

[06:48:14] <bartmax> I have a very important (for me) question : I want to do a knockout (like the example) product-list. I need to know if I can use in the 'product name' an autocomplete. I googled and found that autocomplete and knockout aren't the best friends, but I'm not sure how exactly that works. Can I use jqueryui autocomplete in addition to knockout list management ? [If it's important, I'm using ASPNET MVC]
[06:48:42] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, you know where you do:  $(document).undelegate(".edit_vendor_item", "click", testertje);  what if ive got like function() { etc etc etc instead of testertje?
[06:49:09] <Alex577> SmartTowel: At the moment i'm here: http://jsfiddle.net/as4qH/
[06:50:06] <Gozzy> AdvoWork you can ommit the finction from undelegate http://jsfiddle.net/fRCqH/5/
[06:50:45] <Gozzy> *omit
[06:51:01] <Godfather_> __composern, http://albertanglada.es/js/custom.js
[06:51:10] <Alex577> SmartTowel: OK, index() is wrong...
[06:51:29] <Godfather_> here is the function that i use to fadein fadeout,  $('#ultimas,#populares').click(function(e) { ...
[06:51:40] <bartmax> is there a official irc channel for knockout ?
[06:52:30] <SmartTowel> Alex577: u can use index() to find out what 'n' is
[06:52:42] <SmartTowel> and u can do a check against that.
[06:52:50] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, ive just tried undelegate, same issue occurs :S
[06:52:59] <SmartTowel> or, u can see if the element is() a child of the parent.
[06:53:11] <SmartTowel> which one would be more useful for what u're trying to do?
[06:54:31] <Alex577> just need the number of "li.page", which has the class "active"
[06:55:22] <Hereisanotherlie> how do you stop a div as youre scrolling past it and lock it to the top of the window?
[06:56:31] <Alex577> <li class="page"></li><li class="page active"></li><li class="page"></li> Now i should know, that the second li has active
[06:57:20] <Jon47> Hereisanotherlie: I implemented one of those once, I bound an event to the window scroll event, and set the position of the element to fixed or static depending on where the window was scrolled to
[06:57:52] <SmartTowel> Alex577: you should just be able to do $(this).index()
[06:58:28] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, it appears to fire like:  1st time it loads:  Click called, load called.  2nd time the page is gone into(without a page refresh) it goes Click Called, Click Called, Load Called, Load Called. Does that help anymore?
[06:58:59] <Hereisanotherlie> Jon47: thanks, i just found this too https://github.com/michaelw90/StickyScroller
[06:59:10] <Gozzy> AdvoWork sorry i dont know, try putting it online...
[07:03:20] <sphinxxx> any reason why my page is letting me select multiple radio buttons?
[07:04:33] <Xotix> eusi ernÃ¤hrig ishc doch es defizit
[07:04:42] <Xotix> ups :)
[07:04:58] <Jon47> Hereisanotherlie: something else to consider when binding to the scroll event: http://ejohn.org/blog/learning-from-twitter/
[07:06:36] <Alex577> SmartTowel: please take a look http://jsfiddle.net/as4qH/3/
[07:07:36] <AdvoWork> Gozzy, its online ish, http://jsfiddle.net/fRCqH/7/  but i can't use that to reload the same page, it normally occurs, on clicking of edit, 1st time it alerts, on clicking of view, next time edit shows 2 x alerts
[07:10:17] <Hereisanotherlie> Jon47: thanks thats a good read
[07:11:59] <MagmaRules> Hi there anyone has any experience with jquery drag and drop snap to grid? Im dragging stuff to the screen and every new element is snapping to a differente grid. Only way to align them is to have snap to other elements. Same happens for resize with grid
[07:15:07] <BarisW> How can I get the position of an element with a specific class in an array? Say I have an UL with 10 LI's, one of them has the class 'active'. How can I retrieve the index of the active LI?
[07:18:36] <Larholm> BarisW, http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:18:51] <BarisW> Larholm: thanks
[07:19:28] <em0vskangoura> Is that jQuery code correct: jQuery("br").css("diplay", "none" );
[07:19:43] <em0vskangoura> I want for every br in the page to no have effect
[07:20:17] <em0vskangoura> $("br").css("diplay", "none" ); Sorry for the above is jQuery for Drupal
[07:25:32] <BarisW> em0vskangoura: display instead of display
[07:25:44] <BarisW> but better is $("br").hide();
[07:31:40] <em0vskangoura> Oh God i didnt see my typo :S. Ok ill use hide. thanks
[07:32:00] <AdvoWork> this may be a silly question, but how can i debug duplicate bits of code or similar/
[07:32:23] <AdvoWork> ie checking for multiple occurences of a called .js file or similar
[07:42:54] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/WqATt/ how can i make the layer disappear if i'm hovering over it and while i'm hovering over it.
[07:43:56] <Xotix> if i display: none it on mouseenter, it will trigger a new mouseenter on the div with the text and due to that, it will display it again and then it blinks
[07:44:09] <nFFF> what layer
[07:44:12] <Zogot> you mean editLayer Xotix?
[07:44:22] <nFFF> why post such ambigious statements like that?
[07:44:23] <keystr0k> Is there a cleaner way to move an element down after the next element?  Here's what I currently have:
[07:44:32] <keystr0k> $('.order-review-table tr:contains("E-mail:")').next().after($('.order-review-table tr:contains("E-mail:")'));
[07:44:33] <nFFF> why not post actual element classes or id's??
[07:44:38] <keystr0k> Seems pretty lame.
[07:46:00] <Xotix> Zogt yes, it is the only layer there.
[07:46:52] <keystr0k> I'd like to make use of "this" but it doesn't want to play nice.
[07:47:07] <Xotix> keystr0k: then u r using it wrong
[07:47:13] <keystr0k> Yeah. i figured as much.
[07:47:45] <softmanpetro> will $("a[rel=Group]") select a <A href="" ... rel="Group">...
[07:48:01] <nFFF> keystr0k, you can do this: var el = $('.order-review-table tr:contains("E-mail:")');   el.next().after(el);
[07:48:05] <nFFF> slightly more readable
[07:48:11] <AdvoWork> Is there a way I can see the full source code of everything, viewing the source code seems to leave stuff out?
[07:48:24] <softmanpetro> does $("a[rel=Group]") select a <A href="" ... rel="Group">...
[07:48:51] <keystr0k> nFFF:  Thanksâ€¦ definitely cleaner.

[07:50:27] <nFFF> Im not sure what you are trying to do
[07:50:28] <aqeel> ??
[07:50:31] <AdvoWork> I'm really struggling with a problem. I have a click event, which on click delegate just does alert("test"); if i f5 and go to this page, and click,it shows test. On page change, its set to loadcontent into a div, using load() if i click this link, therefore loading the page into the div, if i do this 3 times, when I click my event, it then shows "test" 3 times. Any ideas please?
[07:50:32] <aqeel> y?
[07:51:23] <aqeel> bot-t what happened?
[07:52:02] <nFFF> AdvoWork

[07:52:44] <Xotix> nFFF i just want to make mouseenter not be triggable until mouseleave was triggered.
[07:53:19] <aqeel> set the condition
[07:53:38] <aqeel> if true mouse enter then exit will be true else false
[07:54:16] <nFFF> Xotix, as aqeel , but I don't see what difference it makes, as you are only setting the display:block to the elemetn
[07:55:19] <AdvoWork> nFFF, ive tried setting a demo on jsfiddle, but i need it to call remote pages which it won't allow me to do
[07:55:58] <nFFF> ok
[07:56:04] <nFFF> So when you click the load 3 times
[07:56:08] <nFFF> it alerts 3 times
[07:56:13] <nFFF> what where you expecting it to do?
[07:56:44] <aqeel> coldhead u there?
[07:57:21] <xec> nFFF: wild guess: he wants only the one alert :D
[07:57:40] <nFFF> :D
[07:58:01] <nFFF> So why not just alert on the first click?
[07:58:02] <xec> nFFF: oh and, i think he meant he only clicks once
[07:58:22] <xec> AdvoWork: this script... is it part of what you load into your div?
[07:58:23] <AdvoWork> nFFF, basically so when i initially load the website, it works as expected, clicking the link runs the function and alerts once. But say i'm navigating around the site, and then click that same link, it does it twice, so im doing: function loadContent(elementSelector, sourceUrl) {var url = "http://"+IPADDRESS + ":"+INTRANET_PORT + sourceUrl;$(""+elementSelector+"").load(url);}  so is load keep adding that information not replacing?
[07:58:36] <Xotix> aweel, what? exit = return? Setting a  variable for that out side the mosueenter?
[07:59:17] <nFFF> $(""+elementSelector+"").load(url);
[07:59:21] <nFFF> nice selector :D
[07:59:21] <AdvoWork> xec, basically, the Jquery code/function that is doing the alert etc, is on say test.html  and i'm loading test.html into my div does that make sense?
[07:59:38] <AdvoWork> nFFF, i was just testing, its literally $(elementSelector).load(url)
[07:59:46] <nFFF> yea :>
[07:59:50] <xec> AdvoWork: yes - it also makes sense that this would replicate the event handler
[08:00:16] <AdvoWork> xec, i really don't know what to do, i've tried to remove() the div i'm loading stuff into, but no luck
[08:00:25] <nFFF> replaceWith

[08:00:45] <Godfather_> i have this problem here, http://albertanglada.es/   when you click on 'ULTIMAS AÑADIDAS' or 'POPULARES' the page misteriosly scrolls up, i dont know why
[08:00:48] <AdvoWork> instead of .load() ?
[08:00:52] <xec> AdvoWork: the question is: why are you loading in a script
[08:01:28] <Godfather_> this just fadout a div and fadein another div,but when you click the span it scroll ups the page
[08:01:41] <AdvoWork> xec, its on page .js thats all
[08:01:47] <AdvoWork> not a link to an external file
[08:02:06] <aqeel> advowork dont load content into div on click
[08:02:22] <nFFF> AdvoWork $(elementSelector).remove().load(url)
[08:02:24] <nFFF> doesn't work?
[08:02:24] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[08:02:43] <xec> AdvoWork: but is the script included in what you load via ajax?
[08:03:13] <Gaia> Anyone here got experience with ajax autocomplete for jquery?
[08:03:19] <aqeel> load it when page loads and use display:none......addremove class on the link.....way fast then loading content everytimne
[08:03:21] <Gaia> by devbrigde?
[08:03:30] <xec> ?anyone @ Gaia
[08:03:30] <bot-t> Gaia, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[08:03:47] <Gaia> haha wicked :D
[08:03:52] <Gaia> ok ok
[08:04:07] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/MyFme/
[08:04:11] <Gaia> Well, how do i get it to autocomplete values from my database!?
[08:04:17] <aqeel> how to optimize this bunch
[08:04:45] <walidvb> smth i do wrong here, with setTimeout.... http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/enrcP/
[08:04:48] <AdvoWork> nFFF, that doesn't work unfortunately, my content won't even load to begin with when I do that
[08:04:53] <walidvb> can't put my finger on it..
[08:05:20] <AdvoWork> xec, apologies, i don't get you. Do you mean is the code included in the page i'm loading?
[08:05:29] <xec> AdvoWork: that's what I'm asking
[08:06:53] <AdvoWork> xec, well, the code on page test.html is specific and unique to page test.html, so when i load my site, it begins on another page, with code on for that, i click the link to open this test page, which loads and and works fine(with the js etc). Its only when clicking that same link to open the same page again that I noticed this occuring, does that answer your query? :S
[08:08:05] <aqeel> load on link causes lots of delay and problems.....try loading content into div as hidden and when click have the div displayed
[08:08:08] <Ted1> Hi there! Does any one know if is possible to get an img size thru URL?
[08:08:11] <nFFF> AdvoWork, var me = $(elementSelector); me.after().load(url); me.remove(); ?
[08:08:38] <xec> AdvoWork: pastebin the test.html?
[08:09:01] <xec> AdvoWork: assuming this is what you're loading in via ajax
[08:10:08] <AdvoWork> nFFF, that fails, it errors about aoData which is for use in datatables, so im assuming its not even loading the initial content it may need
[08:10:13] <AdvoWork> xec, ok, one second
[08:10:19] <aqeel> like that the content gets loaded ONCE but your click will chage contents....
[08:11:22] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/MyFme/
[08:11:29] <aqeel> how to optimize this bunch
[08:11:42] <xec> aqeel: what are you trying to do?
[08:12:37] <walidvb> hi, stupid question, but how do i get to run this code in 1 second: $container.width() - moreWidth);
[08:12:38] <walidvb> ?
[08:12:44] <aqeel> well i have li and i want them to add into jquery sequence so that 1st li loads first ul of other code.....and it is respectively.....1-1.....link calls
[08:13:13] <aqeel> as u can see the flow
[08:13:33] <nFFF> aquatix
[08:13:35] <nFFF> aqeel
[08:13:36] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/MyFme/1/
[08:13:42] <nFFF> why not just that? :\
[08:14:17] <nFFF> or even ?toggleclass
[08:14:20] <nFFF> to make it even shorter
[08:14:22] <walidvb> i tried setTimeout, but somehow it only works with alert(), i really don't know what i'm doing wrong..
[08:14:24] <xec> nFFF: what would $(this) be in that code?
[08:14:25] <AdvoWork> xec, this is that specific page: http://pastebin.com/Tg04VFme  i've removed as much irrelevant bits. The thing is, this occurs on all part of the site now i've noticed, the first time they are loaded, its fine, the 2nd time, it does things twice if that makes sense.
[08:14:39] <AdvoWork> xec, so that is loaded (load()) into my somediv2 div
[08:15:14] <aqeel> toggleClass not working as the class not added direcly.....
[08:15:19] <xec> AdvoWork: so it's like i expected - you keep loading this script over and over
[08:15:41] <nFFF> sorry didn't read code properly :d
[08:15:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/MyFme/2/
[08:15:45] <nFFF> something like that
[08:15:56] <xec> AdvoWork: doesn't matter what elements you remove, as .live() always binds to document...
[08:16:21] <xec> AdvoWork: so you keep creating more and more handlers - why do you have any scripts at all in what you load from the server?
[08:16:26] <Ted1> Hi there! Does any one know if is possible to get an img size thru URL?
[08:17:02] <aqeel> and foir the (.links).........this i would like to put it in the form where it gathers the li into array as i do not need to touch the javascript but is added if html has edited later
[08:18:04] <xec> aqeel: sounds like the problem is more complex than you let us know initially, could you make it a live working demo that actually has content and demonstrates your issue?
[08:18:26] <aqeel> ok
[08:18:44] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[08:18:57] <aqeel> under the source.....see advacemenu.html
[08:19:10] <aqeel> sorry.....advancemenu.js
[08:20:19] <nFFF> why you have some class names as id's
[08:20:19] <aqeel> mainmenu and submenu button have been put in place and is working accordingly....
[08:20:23] <nFFF> whats the point
[08:20:50] <aqeel> id is this page u see and class is called from external file...
[08:21:07] <aqeel> loadsubmenu?
[08:21:07] <nFFF> xec can help you :DD
[08:21:29] * xec runs away screaming
[08:21:32] <Ted1> is it possible to get img size through img URL?
[08:21:34] <aqeel> lol
[08:21:45] <aqeel> u asked...
[08:21:46] <hobodave> any jQuery paper book recommendations? I'm looking at JavaScript & jQuery: The Missing Manual and Learning jQuery, Third Edition
[08:22:03] <nFFF> aqeel
[08:22:03] <aqeel> not trouble follows...
[08:22:09] <nFFF> do you top 2 load's work?
[08:22:09] <aqeel> yup
[08:22:11] <optikalmouse> can I use the css method to see what styles were computed/runtime?
[08:22:16] <aqeel> yessssssssss
[08:22:39] <aqeel> cau u see my demo page
[08:22:40] <AdvoWork> xec, so am i loading multiple versions of the click delegate code? and do you mean why am i loading the JS code within my test page?
[08:23:18] <xec> Ted1: hmm, i don't think so, unless maybe if you make the browser render it first - is it part of your page already?
[08:23:38] <xec> AdvoWork: yes
[08:24:18] <xec> aqeel: so the code you pasted, is the code responsible for creating the correct list under sub menu?
[08:24:31] <Ted1> xec No, itÂ´s not  :/
[08:24:39] <Ted1> xec: no itÂ´s not
[08:24:41] <AdvoWork> xec, can you advise what I can do then, as this code is specific for each page really.
[08:24:55] <aqeel> not creating but to show the loaded content under submenu.....
[08:25:15] <aqeel> else it would load the one that is hovered last...
[08:25:41] <AdvoWork> xec, am i not right in thinking that its loading that code into the div, so how come I can't remove that div and sort of start again?
[08:25:55] <aqeel> if u comment that bunch and hover in main menu can see the difference
[08:26:29] <xec> AdvoWork: when you load html containing script tags, they will run. when you do .live() you attach an event handler to the global document object
[08:27:07] <xec> AdvoWork: what I don't understand is why you have scripts as part of what you load
[08:27:50] <aqeel> xec ....yes and how can i simplify that bunch
[08:27:55] <xec> AdvoWork: usually you have all the scripts you need loaded on first page load and any ajax calls are for content only (no script)
[08:28:26] <xec> aqeel: i can't comment code on your web server, can you make a live testcase?
[08:29:30] <aqeel> well i just need to simplify ....if u got what i am asking
[08:29:30] <AdvoWork> xec, its probably bad judgement on my behalf to be honest, each page is seperate for each task it does really, so i didnt even think/realise this problem til now(way down the line). What can i do to resolve this, ideally as quickly as possible?
[08:30:14] <zelrik> hi
[08:30:50] <xec> AdvoWork: so, you're saying you need the scripts loaded over and over?
[08:31:23] <aqeel> i guess he overused load function
[08:31:25] <xec> aqeel: i still don't know the bigger picture of how your script works
[08:31:48] <zelrik> so I have a div some some id="foo" class="unknownclassname", can I do like foo.removeClass().addClass("newclassname"); ?
[08:32:10] <zelrik> it doesnt seem to work
[08:32:42] <aqeel> simply use toggleClass
[08:33:03] <xec> zelrik: .removeClass() needs a classname specified. if you want to remove and (and all) you can do .attr("class", "")
[08:33:11] <xec> any*
[08:33:12] <AdvoWork> xec, no, not at all, i get what you're saying now, but can't i almost clear that div where its been loaded into and start again? I've done a test and console.log() the contents of that div, and i click/load the page, and then repeat, but it only shows the scripts etc once, unless im missing something, but i'd almost like to act like when i press that button, its fresh and load the content
[08:33:24] <zelrik> so I just do foo.toggleClass("newclassname") ?
[08:34:11] <xec> AdvoWork: doesn't matter what scripts are in the DOM at the moment, they have already run
[08:34:13] <aqeel> foo.toggleClass("oldname","replacewithnam,e")
[08:34:29] <zelrik> I dont know the oldname
[08:35:01] <xec> zelrik: are there multiple classes or just the one
[08:35:09] <AdvoWork> xec, oh, ok so the scripts are loaded first, and then i'm reloading the content, and its storing them/running them again? can i clear or get rid of that or?
[08:35:31] <xec> AdvoWork: no, you can't "un-run" a script
[08:35:32] <zelrik> xec: I have 2 classes actually, I want to replace only if it needs to actually
[08:35:50] <zelrik> sometimes the oldname is different
[08:35:53] <zelrik> sometimes not
[08:36:02] <xec> AdvoWork: what you can do is not put them in the DOM on load
[08:36:03] <aqeel> use condition
[08:36:11] <xec> on ajax load that is
[08:36:18] <aqeel> if old true do this else do this
[08:36:34] <xec> zelrik: did you try the .attr("class", "") trick?
[08:36:49] <zelrik> xec: I think that can work in combination with toggle
[08:36:51] <zelrik> let me try
[08:36:58] <aqeel> yup
[08:37:43] <xec> when you do that, any class will be removed, so toggleClass doesn't make sense really, if it is ran right after it would always add
[08:37:45] <zelrik> actually
[08:37:46] <AdvoWork> xec, and how would I do that though?
[08:38:15] <zelrik> can I just do .attr("class","newclass")
[08:38:17] <zelrik> and that s it
[08:38:20] <walidvb> hi, how can i get this to work? (very very simple setTimeout)

[08:38:50] <xec> AdvoWork: use $.get() or $.ajax() instead, and in the callback filter out what you want (or remove what you don't) -- or better: don't have scripts in the file you're requesting
[08:39:18] <xec> zelrik: indeed :)
[08:39:22] <AdvoWork> get or ajax instead of what though>
[08:39:38] <kitikonti> zelrik, if you want to give a class you could also use .addClass("newclass")
[08:39:48] <codeWarrior42> Good morning team!
[08:39:51] <AdvoWork> and xec would putting all the code on each of those pages into a .js file for each page for example, and having them all on the main page fix the issue or?
[08:39:54] <walidvb> mornin.
[08:40:44] <xec> AdvoWork: yes, that sounds like a good idea
[08:41:04] <AdvoWork> could that cause any further problems?
[08:41:12] <walidvb> sry to bother again, but i can try and try, there's smth i'm just not seeing here... http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/enrcP/
[08:41:18] <walidvb> how is that wrong??
[08:41:42] <tocka> Hey, I have some difficulties with my contact form that im trying to make
[08:41:49] <tocka> For some unknown reason to me
[08:41:52] <tocka> it doesnt want to work :
[08:41:54] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/VAksA/
[08:42:01] <xec> AdvoWork: unlikely, but what I do know is that the way you're currently patching things together is causing problems ;)
[08:42:02] <tocka> That is it doesnt hide the divs
[08:42:09] <tocka> and it doesnt validate or anything
[08:42:56] <xec> walidvb: you are executing functions rather than passing them to setTimeout
[08:43:07] <gmurphey> walidvb: setTimeout(test,80000);â€‹
[08:43:18] <walidvb> gmurphey: xec:
[08:43:20] <walidvb> thank you
[08:43:22] <walidvb> god
[08:43:25] <walidvb> i was going crazy
[08:43:34] <walidvb> what if you want to pass a fct with argument?
[08:43:39] <zelrik> it works
[08:43:41] <zelrik> perfect
[08:43:51] <AdvoWork> xec, sorry to be ott, but to confirm, i'm loading content(my html page) into a div, and because that html page has JS code in it, its causing an issue. So ideally i need to put thta JS code into a seperate file, which isn't called when I do load?
[08:44:12] <xec> walidvb: you can do an anynomous function, like setTimeout(function(){ alert("WHOA") },1000);
[08:44:28] <hurry> why i download the slider from http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#rangemin but i have slider very large?
[08:44:29] <walidvb> xec: alright
[08:44:33] <xec> anonymous? anynomous? ananonynonmous?
[08:44:34] <walidvb> thank you very much
[08:44:46] <xec> i can't spell it, but it's something like that :P
[08:45:27] <tocka> Can someone help? http://jsfiddle.net/VAksA/, the form doesnt hide the div and its generally not working, cant figure out why
[08:45:48] <AdvoWork> and xec, 2ndly, what did you mean by: use $.get() or $.ajax() instead ?
[08:45:51] <xec> AdvoWork: what is "ott"? but yes, exactly
[08:46:07] <xec> AdvoWork: using .load() as ajax has limitations to what you can do with it
[08:47:17] <xec> AdvoWork: with $.ajax() or $.get() you can do stuff when things are returned rather than just push it to the DOM immediately
[08:47:31] <AdvoWork> xec, sorry, over the top lol, wanting to clarify
[08:47:57] <AdvoWork> xec, but surely that would still push the same html page to the div?
[08:48:49] <xec> AdvoWork: no, $.ajax() does not push anything anywhere, it just requests data from a url and the rest is up to you to script
[08:49:17] <tocka> anyone?
[08:49:17] <codeWarrior42> my Mom just used Google for the first time :^))
[08:49:22] <codeWarrior42> w00t!
[08:49:27] <xec> codeWarrior42: lol, tell her gratz
[08:49:51] <codeWarrior42> she says that "it is a really good resource."
[08:49:54] <codeWarrior42> I would agree.
[08:50:14] <xec> they should definetely use that as a tagline
[08:50:21] <xec> Google - a really good resource
[08:50:23] <AdvoWork> xec, ok, and is there any other way at all,doing the current way I am, or is it screwed?
[08:50:41] <xec> tocka: your jsfiddle has no jqueries?
[08:51:30] <aqeel> well thanks .......
[08:51:31] <AdvoWork> xec, and what about things such as: $("#somediv").load('/status.php?customerid='+customerid).dialog({   that status.php page isn't going to know about my main page is it?
[08:51:40] <AdvoWork> so wouldnt be able to pick up the .js external file?
[08:52:35] <xec> AdvoWork: i'm sorry, you lost me
[08:53:31] <AdvoWork> ie that call/load is for a php file, which contains php code, html, and js(like the others). If im taking the code out of there(js) and putting in an external file, the functions/handlers on there, aren't going to know where to look are they?
[08:53:40] <AdvoWork> actually, i think im being sillt loll
[08:53:45] <xec> aqeel: i doubt anyone can/will help you unless you make it easy for us to do so: create a small pared-down working testcase and state exactly what you need/want/expect

[08:55:27] <tocka> Oh sorry :]
[08:57:19] <xec> tocka: so what was working and what do you expect this to do?
[08:57:39] <tocka> Firstly the formSent Div should be hidden
[08:57:57] <tocka> Then when a person presses submit the email field is being checked for errors
[08:58:09] <tocka> and if everything is ok
[08:58:13] <tocka> the form slides up
[08:58:29] <tocka> display:none; and the formSent is being displayed (slides down)

[09:16:35] <AdvoWork> if doing a load() i,e loading a html page into a div, i assume its better if that new html page isnt a full html page, ie without <html><head> etc etc? as it would be repeated right?
[09:19:39] <sirch> I want to use the arrow keys to perform a custom function therefore I had to use 'return false' to stop the default action (scrolling). But now I want to prevent my custom function and allow the default action (text navigation) when the user is typing into a text box . What kind of conditional statement can I use to describe this scenario?
[09:20:28] <sirch> 	$(document).keydown(function(e) {
[09:20:28] <sirch> 		if (e.which === 38) {
[09:20:28] <sirch> 			// custom function
[09:20:28] <sirch> 			// return false;
[09:20:28] <sirch> 		}
[09:20:38] <ajpiano> OMG PEOPLE USE PASTEBINS HOLY CRAP
[09:21:01] <nFFF> :>>
[09:21:14] <nFFF> was just about to post autocomplete plugin
[09:23:48] <opdynamiks> Please use PasteBin or jsfiddle.net
[09:24:40] <sirch> http://jsfiddle.net/LXX3Y/
[09:25:39] <sirch> I want to use arrow keys for my own function, but not when user is typing in a text box.
[09:25:52] <AdvoWork> nFFF, any comments on my about question?
[09:26:22] <NoiseEee> AdvoWork: what do you THINK would be the correct thing to do?
[09:26:32] <opdynamiks> sirch: you'll have to add 2 extra listeners to the text box. on focus, set an attribute on the text box to "editing=true". on blur, set editing=false
[09:26:54] <opdynamiks> sirch: then on your keydown function, check if editing=true before taking over the keystroke.
[09:28:05] <sirch> opdynamiks: thanks
[09:29:42] <AdvoWork> NoiseEee, i'd assume not including html etc again, as its already there, but want to do this correctly
[09:30:30] <NoiseEee> AdvoWork: well considering all markup has to be valid, i'd go with your hunch.
[09:32:12] <kara_sweets> what does : function( $ ) mean?
[09:32:50] <AdvoWork> NoiseEee, i'm loading content into a div (so html elements etc, im taking all JS out, because it was duplicating it). Originally the html page i was loading had on page JS, which on ready called say list_products();  im taking that JS out now into an external.js file that will be put on my main page, thus not loaded again, but therefore now is it not going to try and list_procuts() on my home page rather than the page I want? Or would I still le
[09:32:50] <AdvoWork> ave a call to list_products() on my loaded page?
[09:49:37] <AdvoWork> if 2 .js files have the same function in it, and a page calls that function, how does it decide what function to use,ie from what file?
[09:51:37] <nFFF> AdvoWork
[09:51:44] <nFFF> is that really the right question to ask
[09:51:52] <jedimind> yeah, that seems a little silly
[09:52:04] <nFFF> do you not think your software design is really fuarked up :<
[09:53:07] <AdvoWork> i've not got the above ^ but was wondering what would happen
[09:55:36] <jedimind> AdvoWork, i think it would try either try to run both, or run the one that was last included
[09:55:46] <jedimind> i cant remember because that's just a monumentally stupid thing to do that noone ever does
[09:55:52] <NoiseEee> AdvoWork: try it and see for gods sake.  don't just sit there wondering.  your computer isn't going to catch fire.
[10:03:12] <multipass> hi, im trying to do a jquery ajax to a url, but im having a problem if the user uses "www." appended to the url... I submit to a non www url
[10:03:21] <multipass> is there a easy solution?
[10:04:04] <eworbit> you mean prepended, not appended, right?
[10:04:05] <opdynamiks> AdvoWork: you're not supposed to have two function definitions in the same context of the window. so you would probably get an error
[10:04:37] <ravenzz> basically you wouldn't have both the www and the non-www address
[10:04:42] <ravenzz> multipass ^
[10:05:09] <multipass> sorry what?
[10:05:33] <multipass> should i try to grab the users url and see if they have www or not, then change the url it posts to?
[10:05:44] <ravenzz> `g 302 redirect  @ multipass
[10:05:44] <caniuse> multipass: 302 Redirect - http://www.internetofficer.com/seo/302-redirect/
[10:05:55] <opdynamiks> multipass: if you specify the URL as the full absolute URL, such as http://example.com/ajaxpage.php, it will always go to the non-www
[10:06:31] <multipass> right now i have, "url: "http://example.com/lead-resources/salesforce-post.php","
[10:07:03] <opdynamiks> multipass: then the AJAX request will never add in "www" by itself.
[10:08:35] <ravenzz> asaik if www is an ALIAS (and not a subdomain) it should work
[10:09:11] <ravenzz> afaik
[10:09:13] <ravenzz> :p
[10:20:46] <magcius> grrr... is it possible to cancel an outstanding AJAX request?
[10:21:56] <magcius> Oh, I was thinking it would follow Deferred conventions, but seems that it's "abort", not "reject
[10:25:59] <guy> Don't get it. jQuery has .lt() but not .gt()?
[10:27:09] <Haprog> no it doesn't?
[10:27:21] <Haprog> it has :lt() and :gt() selectors though
[10:27:52] <guy> wtf.. hallucinations.
[10:28:55] <walidvb> hi guys! anyone knows how to theme a facebook like button?
[10:30:07] <eworbit> walidvb: not a jquery topic is it?
[10:30:15] <walidvb> eworbit: not really, no..
[10:30:17] <eworbit> google: facebook button generator
[10:30:24] <tw2113> doesn't facebook do all that because they insist on consistency?
[10:34:43] <aghouseh> quick question. whats the best way to make a 'container' accessible via a global variable? can i define the var $cont = $('#container'); outside of the $(function(){}); and have it be available from all functions?
[10:36:05] <Emn1ty> aghouseh: container = $('#foo'); ? I think that if you just don't declare $con or var before your variable it should be globally accessible.
[10:36:21] <Emn1ty> $var*
[10:36:21] <aghouseh> Emn1ty: yeah, thats how i had it and it was working.. but it breaks IE8 :(
[10:36:29] <Emn1ty> hm...
[10:36:37] <opdynamiks> aghouseh: yes, you can either define your variable outside all functions (the window scope) or define it inside a function using window.myvar = value;
[10:36:45] <Emn1ty> well, try it with $var then and see if it works
[10:37:09] <aghouseh> opdynamiks: ok, if i call it, do i have to specify window.myvar every time then? or is it just accessible via myvar?
[10:37:40] <opdynamiks> aghouseh: it's probably safer and more understandable to call it back with window.myvar so you know it's a global variable. but it shouldn't be required
[10:37:46] <aghouseh> ok
[10:38:13] <opdynamiks> aghouseh: it's always better to be more verbose especially because of IE
[10:38:23] <aghouseh> gotcha
[10:39:19] <aghouseh> awesome that worked like a charm.
[10:39:29] <aghouseh> i can thankfully kill my xp vhd now. cheers!
[10:39:31] <aghouseh> :)
[10:46:09] <magcius> So what do people recommend for jQuery templates?
[10:46:20] <magcius> Not even jQuery templates, I guess. Just templates in general.
[10:51:03] <steveoh> whats the css selector syntax for searching data-* attributes
[10:51:22] <steveoh> or the jquery query syntax
[10:52:02] <_Brandon_> hi, I have a jquery library that dynamically adds new elements, is it possible to trigger a function whenever a new element is created without modifying this library?
[10:52:53] <Emn1ty> Brandon: call the creation even, when complete call your function? Without knowing how the library works there is not much I can tell you.
[10:58:27] <opdynamiks> _Brandon_: perhaps you would find the .on() or .live() functions useful?
[11:02:21] <_Brandon_> opdynamiks: yeah but I would need a "create" event, I don't think that there is one
[11:02:36] <ajpiano> _Brandon_: see ?newContent
[11:02:37] <bot-t> _Brandon_, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[11:02:50] <_Brandon_> thanks
[11:02:56] <ajpiano> _Brandon_: or liveQuery will do that as well

[11:44:44] <johnkpaul> AdvoWork: probably a missing right bracket, but if you just changed your code recently, just control z a few times
[11:45:29] <AdvoWork> johnkpaul, not a recent change but will have a lewk

[11:46:33] <sysnsmams> orginally it must be one clik but it loads frame 4 times not one
[11:47:26] <johnkpaul> AdvoWork: you could try putting it through a syntax highlighter and see where it starts to mess up
[11:47:38] <johnkpaul> I don't know of any tool that will give you the line number, but there probably is one
[11:47:49] <AdvoWork> any you recommend? i'm on ubuntu, im actually using dreamweaver which normally moans about syntax errors :S

[11:51:03] <johnkpaul> Manaus: when you say it doesn't work, do you have any more details
[11:51:33] <Manaus> it makes my overlay modal stay unvisible
[11:52:10] <sysnsmams> any help ?
[11:52:30] <johnkpaul> ajax and button clicks usually have nothing to do with modal windows, so I think you'll have to show us your code
[11:52:35] <johnkpaul> put into a working jsfiddle
[12:00:01] <jeffsmykil> I have a table that has a column with a dropdown in it that is populated via ajax, the same dropdown is in every table cell, what is the recomended manner of dealing with this?  Do I save the return as a global variable?  Is there some sort of caching I can do?
[12:00:30] <sysnsmams> 78.182.213.67 -user:test -pass:test any  help will appricated
[12:01:16] <Manaus> this is the jsfiddle I managed to put together , http://jsfiddle.net/Dxx82/  the last rows of the js make the modal window invisible
[12:03:03] <Manaus> sorry it's full of 'localhost' :)
[12:03:47] <jarr0dsz> hey guys
[12:04:03] <jarr0dsz> i have a jfiddle wich im working on for some time now, i cannot figure out how i can make it close only on close class
[12:04:04] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/11/
[12:04:32] <jarr0dsz> what i try is to have the toggle, but it should only close ( collapse ) when i click on the .close tagg how could i mix that in with the toggle? or should i use another function?
[12:10:21] <millermedeiros> is there any plugin that abstracts keypress events so I don't need to handle the keyCode by myself and that works with event delegation / jquery 1.7  $.fn.on?
[12:13:14] <millermedeiros> was hoping I could do something like:  $('#foo').on('keypress.return', '.bar', doSomething);  - I don't need any key combinations so far, only basic keys like "return", "up", "down", "left", "right"
[12:16:18] <AdvoWork> I know this isnt PHP but if jquery is calling a php file, can a problem in the file cause an  SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input ? even though firebug shows now bad repsonse/
[12:18:37] <johnkpaul> AdvoWork: you mean an ajax call, if it is set to data type script, then yes, it can
[12:18:39] <johnkpaul> but not if it's a 404
[12:18:45] <johnkpaul> can you put the code onto jsfiddle
[12:22:53] <MagmaRules> Anyone has a clue what this plugin: http://pastie.org/3550779 now enters an infinite loop when the line: "if (!$.browser.msie) splitter.trigger("resize");" is evaluated? I know its suppose to be for jquery 1.3, but it all works except the resize based on the window size
[12:23:37] <MagmaRules> My knowledge of custom events is limited, so I'm not seeing the problem
[12:23:54] <MagmaRules> i know that it doenst even enter the actual "resize" event method
[12:24:26] <ag4ve> when i use the jq-ui autocomplete library, it doesn't fire when i re-enter the same search. any ideas?
[12:25:46] <johnkpaul> MagmaRules: where is the resize event bound to panes?
[12:26:05] <mansoor> Anyone got an awesome idea for a plugin? I'm taking requests :D
[12:26:08] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul: think its bound to splitters
[12:26:45] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul: i seem to get the infinite loop right inside the $(window).bind("resize"
[12:27:06] <MagmaRules> could it be that the resize of the bars triggers a resize of the window and it loops there ?
[12:30:30] <c0d3rg1rl> MagmaRules: did join late, so info is missing, are you using http://api.jquery.com/resize/ ? or an own resize of window?
[12:31:46] <MagmaRules> c0d3rg1rl: that code is from an old plugin, but i think its the jquery one
[12:34:42] <MagmaRules> i just put a condition there to only fire once in the window resize and seems like moving the splitter triggers a window resize, so I'm guessing thats where the error comes from. Now only if i could understand how to fix it =P
[12:35:26] <c0d3rg1rl> MagmaRules: the resize event fires very often during a resize-action of the user, could be like hundreds of times... maybe this is your problem.
[12:35:41] <MagmaRules> inn could be
[12:35:48] <johnkpaul> MagmaRules: this is difficult to do without a real example to see the problem
[12:36:05] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul: ohh thats the easy part ill make you one =)
[12:40:27] <MagmaRules> Carfull this will hang firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/vx9L5/
[12:41:10] <Zzaichik> string up firefox
[12:41:31] <MagmaRules> Only way to observe the behavior is to use chrome as it doesn't hang
[12:41:33] <MagmaRules> =)
[12:42:31] <c0d3rg1rl> But Chrome says "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded"
[12:42:46] <MagmaRules> Yup i know =)
[12:42:51] <MagmaRules> thats the infinite loop
[12:43:13] <MagmaRules> if i remove: anchorToWindow: true from the options it works, as it doesn't bind the window resize event
[12:43:47] <johnkpaul> MagmaRules: I think that it has to do with your resplit
[12:43:48] <MagmaRules> BTW the expected behavior is this one: http://methvin.com/splitter/3csplitter.html
[12:43:53] <johnkpaul> resplit  or setbarstate
[12:43:58] <johnkpaul> something there triggers the window resize
[12:44:06] <johnkpaul> which then triggers the splitter resize
[12:44:09] <johnkpaul> and so on
[12:44:11] <johnkpaul> (I think)
[12:44:58] <MagmaRules> johnkpaul: something like that, but i think it doesn't even reach the resplit. as soon as it triggers the splitter resize it triggers the window resize
[12:46:20] <johnkpaul> even without the !browser line
[12:46:22] <johnkpaul> I still get that error
[12:46:40] <johnkpaul> so it's not because of trigger the resize on the panes
[12:46:50] <MagmaRules> ok =) thats another clue then =)
[12:48:03] <kanzure> hi all. i have a situation like this: <li>useful juicy data <strong>something else</strong>other data that i don't want</li>
[12:48:11] <kanzure> what would be a good selector to strip out everything after the strong?
[12:48:40] <kanzure> li[class='...']>strong gets me to the strong.. maybe i should use a .previous?
[12:51:41] <kanzie> has anyone worked with getting timezone-support in Flot here?
[12:51:47] <c0d3rg1rl> MagmaRules: where did you get 1.6 of the plugin? I only see 1.5x on authors page, maybe 1.6 is buggy?
[12:52:22] <MagmaRules> c0d3rg1rl: the problem is the same i found it in this page: http://methvin.com/splitter/vsplitter-docking.html
[12:53:49] <c0d3rg1rl> ah, I only saw the 152 filename...
[12:53:57] <imsky> herp
[12:55:40] <MagmaRules> c0d3rg1rl: well i guess I'm giving up for now and going to use the custom version i have from: http://krikus.com/js/splitter/ . Just have to put a warning label for chrome. when shrinking the window all the screen starts to flash
[12:57:29] <AdvoWork> how much difference is there in loading jquery/js on a page, or loading it from an external file on the same server/
[12:59:31] <c0d3rg1rl> kanzure: quick&dirty: var juice = $('#your-li').html().split('<')[0];
[13:00:01] <Logikos> AdvoWork: if you mean includeing it within script tags on a page vs pointing to the external file .. there can be a big difference ... if you put it in script tags it has to be sent out with every single page refresh, or other internal page on the site, where as if you link to it, the browser downloads it one time with an extra request but then caches it so on future pages it doesnt re-download
[13:00:01] <Logikos> it each time, cause it already has it
[13:00:05] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: external file: one http-request more
[13:00:58] <Logikos> yes, its an extra http request, but only one time ... if its included in script tags, the full thing is included in the page size for each internal page
[13:01:11] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: if you have many pages, better use external .js, smaller pages, cached .js
[13:04:15] <c0d3rg1rl> kanzure: if you also need the content of the strong, get it with var strong = $('#your-li strong').text();
[13:04:50] <AdvoWork> Log1x, c0d3rg1rl this is basically a big site, and loads of big sections im splitting out, and im worried im making too many external files
[13:05:53] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: big site = external .js
[13:07:52] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, and does it matter using multiple?
[13:09:12] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: if the js-code is same for all pages, you can put all js-code in one external .js file
[13:10:04] <CCmonster> when I do a fade/hide my element is 'jumpy', how do I combat this?
[13:10:51] <MagmaRules> lol i have another plugin for splitting and for some reason when i hide and show child views it reduces the flicker in chrome
[13:11:17] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, its niot, its diff for each section really
[13:11:57] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: but the jquery-lib is same, so put this in external, rest inline.
[13:15:19] <Mage_Dude> http://jsfiddle.net/aAz6u/
[13:15:48] <AdvoWork> one other query, im moving code from the page to files as we've been talking about, i had an input field with autocomplete, but its stopped working, any suggestions: http://pastebin.com/rkxGdsb6  is the auto complete, no request are being sent to the php file, but the names are correct
[13:15:49] <Mage_Dude> Looking at the request in Firebug shows it returns 200, yet it jumps to the error: block... why would that happen?
[13:17:34] <AdvoWork> As a test, i've just put the auto complete code back in the html file, and it works as it did before, any reason why it being in an external file would stop it working?
[13:17:47] <FrameFever> can i load script not only inside <head> tags?
[13:20:17] <Zzaichik> yes
[13:21:10] <timwis> Hey guys, any idea why I'd get an "Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal return statement" on an eval() ? http://pastebin.com/3yHqZTxB line 28
[13:21:57] <DeLorean731> Working with jquery and a json api for the first time. Having trouble grabbing the info from the api. Can anyone point me in the right direction as to what I'm doing wrong? As you can see I'm  trying a few different things in this code: http://pastebin.com/wYTFuN4c
[13:22:48] <timwis> DeLorean731, line 26 should be data[0]
[13:23:08] <DeLorean731> ok
[13:23:15] <plln> is anyone using or knowing about jquery top_up plugin ?
[13:23:17] <DeLorean731> here's the array that is returned: http://pastebin.com/3B2dvsq3
[13:23:25] <Rushing> timwis: do eval("("+ code + ")")
[13:23:32] <timwis> also, i'd do function(key, val)
[13:23:41] <Rushing> you basically need to wrap the evaluated code in parens
[13:24:47] <DeLorean731> timwis: thanks for pointing that out. anything else? It's still not printing anything to the page
[13:25:02] <timwis> will try, but will that still execute the return i'm trying to eval?
[13:25:06] <timwis> hang on delorean731
[13:25:23] <DeLorean731> take your time, ty
[13:25:49] <AdvoWork> argh this is driving me mad, why wouldnt code in an external file run, the code is fine, because if i put it in the main file it does, if i view the source for the page im on, it can see the .js file with the autocomplete code in, but nothing, no errors or anything. Any ideas please?
[13:26:06] <timwis> rushing: Now I'm getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;"
[13:26:17] <timwis> (on the same line)
[13:26:42] <dschuett> $.post('scripts/fetchresults.php', { loc: intlocation}, .... works fine in chrome and firefox, but in ie i get the following error mysql_real_escape_string() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given
[13:27:01] <dschuett> why is it passing as an array in internet explorer?!
[13:27:17] <timwis> DeLorean731: that paste is not JSON it's a php array
[13:27:27] <timwis> you need to do json_encode($array); in your PHP
[13:27:28] <Rushing> timwis: i can't tell what the code being evaluated is, so i'm not sure
[13:27:56] <timwis> Rushing, it's this: "checkChangesAndStopTimer(&#39;admincases.asp?case_status=10&amp;SID=&amp;priority_ref=0&amp;depart_ref=0&amp;category_ref=0&amp;user_ref_assigned=0&amp;page=0&amp;log_type=0&amp;SubmType=Save&#39;);return false;"
[13:28:06] <plln> ÅŸ
[13:28:32] <Rushing> probably need to convert your html entities
[13:29:12] <Mage_Dude> Anyone know why an ajax request that returns 200 would execute the error block?
[13:29:25] <timwis> hm, no tsure how to convert html entities in js
[13:29:36] <timwis> googling
[13:30:08] <Rushing> i don't think there's a built-in wayâ€¦might need to try getting it into your code differently
[13:30:25] <ag4ve> can i have multiple events on one element? how would i control which fires first?
[13:30:50] <Rushing> not sure why the function call uses &#39; instead of regular single or double quotes
[13:31:26] <timwis> Rushing: You mean like eval('(' + decodeURIComponent(oldaction) + ')'); ? (same error about the unexpected ; )
[13:31:45] <c0d3rg1rl> Mage_Dude: If I check your code in Chrome, the request is canceled, and the error shoud be a function() {}
[13:31:48] <DeLorean731> timwis: should I do it right in between those quotes on line 24?
[13:31:54] <Rushing> no, decodeURI is different than html entities
[13:32:02] <millermedeiros> timwis Rushing: quick and dirty HTML entities conversion https://github.com/millermedeiros/eclipse_monkey_scripts/blob/master/scripts/MillerMedeiros__HTML__Decode_HTML_40_entities.js
[13:32:17] <Rushing> ah thanks millermedeiros
[13:32:32] <Rushing> timwis: i still think it'd be best to put it in your code differently
[13:32:32] <Rushing> y
[13:32:58] <Mage_Dude> c0d3rg1rl: The jsfiddle ajax stuff is weird (and rarely works correctly), but on the real setup it returns 200 with the correct content.
[13:33:07] <Rushing> you could also just create a string statically in your javascript, like the one you're grabbing dynamically
[13:33:18] <c0d3rg1rl> ag4ve: "When an event reaches an element, all handlers bound to that event type for the element are fired. If there are multiple handlers registered, they will always execute in the order in which they were bound. "
[13:33:19] <timwis> Rushing, yeah I just did that
[13:33:20] <timwis> same error
[13:33:21] <timwis> eval('(checkChangesAndStopTimer("admincases.asp?case_status=2&SID=&priority_ref=0&depart_ref=0&category_ref=0&user_ref_assigned=0&page=0&log_type=0&SubmType=Save");return false;)');
[13:33:26] <timwis> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;
[13:33:37] <millermedeiros> Rushing timwis: delete the crap around the replaces, it's from my old eclipse monkey scripts... the "magic" happens on the chained .replace()  calls..
[13:33:51] <timwis> DeLorean731: No, I'm saying the data you're fetching is not JSON data
[13:34:31] <c0d3rg1rl> Mage_Dude: never tested ajax with jsfiddle, but I think there is a function() {...} missing at your error: line
[13:34:42] <jjames_> Howdy! Question about jquery-ui selectable behavior: I'd like to make it so selectable works as-is with one modification: when you click on an item that is already selected, don't reset the selected items (instead, kick off a custom function). The selected array should only be reset when you click on a deselected item. Any ideas?
[13:34:56] <Rushing> timwis: not sure manâ€¦i'd just break the string down into its smallest components and add them back until something works or breaks
[13:35:23] <Mage_Dude> c0d3rg1rl: The error part still runs, I'm just curious what would cause jquery to think that a request that gives status 200 is an error. 500 or 404 should be an error though. Hmmmm
[13:36:14] <AdvoWork> Any suggestions please, really struggling with this. Got a page that has all the links to the external .js files, that work as i can click/view them. My page has stuff on it, for example: <img src="add-to_group_icon.png" style="width:16px;height:16px;" id="add_product_add_price_break_image">  and in my external.js file I have: $('#add_product_add_price_break_image').click( function(){  alert("here"); });  and it won't alert or Error or anything,
[13:36:15] <AdvoWork>  in firebug/chrome etc, any ideas please?
[13:36:25] <AdvoWork> dont know what to try or even think why it wouldnt be picking up the file
[13:36:56] <ag4ve> c0d3rg1rl: ah right, js executes from top to bottom. thanks (structured oo - sometimes forget about the structure)
[13:37:05] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: put the .click() in a .ready()
[13:37:16] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, it is, meant to say that
[13:37:29] <AdvoWork> its in $(document).ready(function(){ }
[13:37:47] <timwis> Rushing, okay I tried different versions of the string. It gives the semicolon error if there's a semicolon, and a return error if there's a returl
[13:37:48] <timwis> return*
[13:37:49] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: how/where in page is external.js included?
[13:38:11] <plln> how can i debug javascript library ?
[13:38:21] <plln> ( on runtime )
[13:38:28] <Rushing> not sure what the purpose of the return false there is anyways
[13:38:32] <plln> ( console.log is not accepted )
[13:38:39] <AdvoWork> basically on my main page(template.html), ive got a div on there, and im load() this other page into it, which loads fine, the external.js file is included in my main template.html file. If i put the js on the same other page it works, but not what im trying to do, any ideas?
[13:38:54] <timwis> Rushing I know, but i'm inserting my own code into an existing application i pay for
[13:38:59] <timwis> asp.net crap
[13:39:06] <Rushing> right, well return false just cancels the event
[13:39:21] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: is this page public? url?
[13:39:24] <timwis> right, after calling their function
[13:39:27] <Rushing> so i guess it's pulling that in as part of the attribute, but when you evaluate it, it's not evaluated int he context of a function, so it's invalid
[13:39:28] <timwis> they want to cancel the click
[13:39:46] <plln> AdvoWork your function is calling when doucment ready right?
[13:39:49] <Rushing> so i'd just do a replace(/return .+$/, "") or something
[13:40:20] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: are you using frames?
[13:40:21] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, its not public unfortunately, i did try and jsfiddle it, but it loads the external page which I can't do.  the thing is, even though this other page is being loaded, it should be able to see the js file, as the js file is defined on that page.
[13:40:23] <timwis> Rushing - yeah I think that's the problem, it's returning insice the success function
[13:40:27] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, not frames no
[13:40:51] <AdvoWork> plln, the function is within a document ready yeah, but when i click my image(which should call the function) nothing occurs
[13:41:16] <plln> possible 2 option
[13:41:17] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: put an alert(123); in your onready, does it show?
[13:41:41] <plln> two js files have same name function
[13:41:58] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, as soon as i refresh the page it alerts that
[13:42:04] <plln> so javascript stop worrking then your code wil now work
[13:42:19] <plln> exactly c0d3rg1rl
[13:42:24] <plln> good catch
[13:43:49] <AdvoWork> so its showing the alert, so its seeing my code, so what could this be then?
[13:44:18] <c0d3rg1rl> double ids? like multiple id="add_product_add_price_break_image" ?
[13:44:57] <plln> $(document).ready(function() { alert(document.domain)});
[13:45:10] <plln> AdvoWork: try this
[13:45:21] <plln> put it in the bottom on page
[13:45:46] <plln> dont forget script tags
[13:47:02] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, just changed it to xxxxxx  and tried again, same issue so not a double id afaik,  plln do you mean on the bottom of my main page or the external js or the included file?
[13:47:16] <plln> your main page
[13:47:28] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: can you put this in your main onready after the 123? alert($('#add_product_add_price_break_image').attr('src'));
[13:48:03] <c0d3rg1rl> this should show the src="" of your image, if jquery can see it.
[13:48:29] <DeLorean731> timwis: is there a way worth dealing with that I can iterate through that php with jquery/ajax or is it not worth it?
[13:48:32] <plln> ( just use firefox and open web developer, reload page  cath the error )
[13:48:47] <kristofer91> Hey guys,
[13:48:54] <DeLorean731> timwis: I'm not sure what the best way is to grab this data and hopefully update the page without refreshing
[13:48:55] <timwis> Rushing: will replace(/return .+$/, "") replace "return false;" as well as "return false ;" etc. ?
[13:49:00] <AdvoWork> plln, it alerts that on page load. c0d3rg1rl just trying
[13:49:15] <timwis> DeLorean731: is it not your data you're fetching?
[13:49:32] <DeLorean731> it's not my data no, it's an API from a site I use
[13:49:41] <kristofer91> i'm unsure about how to be able to add, i'm using a form plugin in wordpress, and what i'm trying to do sinec it's jquery, i want to be able to add a specific word in the url, on each step
[13:49:41] <timwis> there's probably a url parameter to set the format to json
[13:50:03] <timwis> http://site.com/path/?format=jsonp or something
[13:50:22] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, it says undefined, but thats because it is on the first page, until i load() in the other page, but then it doesn't alert if that makes sense?
[13:50:30] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: so you use frames?
[13:50:49] <c0d3rg1rl> how do you load the other page?
[13:51:03] <AdvoWork> no, not frames, i've got a <div> on my main page, that onclick of hyperlinks i load() the other pages into it, if you get me
[13:51:13] <chovy> is it possible to delete all events attached for a given namespace?
[13:51:19] <c0d3rg1rl> how do you load the other page? with ajax?
[13:51:40] <timwis> Rushing it's working! the replace of the 'return' with your regex worked. Thanks :)
[13:51:50] <Rushing> great :) np
[13:51:58] <timwis> delorean731 check the api docs
[13:52:01] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: ah, you mean jquery load()
[13:52:44] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, yeah its juqyers load() it loads the page fine, so i can see it, but no external js files work
[13:53:08] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: then you need to add the click-handler after the page has been loaded, see http://api.jquery.com/load/  at "Callback Function"
[13:53:33] <c0d3rg1rl> the onready is already done before your load() occurs.
[13:53:45] <c0d3rg1rl> so it can't see the image and can't bind the click.
[13:54:21] <AdvoWork> so, load my other page in as normal? and is this on the onread bit - click handler i mean?
[13:54:57] <plln> need help jquery-ui + jquery top_up plugin problem
[13:55:16] <c0d3rg1rl> locate alert('Load was performed.'); in the example, there goes your $('#add_product_add_price_break_image').click( function(){  alert("here"); });
[13:55:25] <plln> 78.182.213.67 user:null password:null
[13:55:41] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, but what if i've got loads of code etc, like other functions such as function dothis() { } ?
[13:56:42] <chovy> how do I unbind an event that was created with this: $(document).on('click', "#myapp a", fn);
[13:56:45] <c0d3rg1rl> the function() can be in external .js, only the click-handler adding should be there
[13:56:47] <plln> when i click + link it loads a frame
[13:56:54] <plln> but it loads frame 4 times
[13:57:16] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, sorry to be going over this, what if my other page has say 20 differnt click handlers?
[13:58:01] <c0d3rg1rl> plln: a virus warning shows up with your page: Trojam JpgIframe
[13:58:09] <plln> not posible
[13:58:15] <plln> my machine is linux
[13:59:01] <plln> here is the iframe
[13:59:03] <plln> http://localhost/reseller/gamedetail.php?bultenID=25
[13:59:13] <plln> bultenID is changes dynamically
[13:59:31] <plln> but i am using for iframe top_up iframe
[14:00:01] <plln> http://gettopup.com/
[14:00:35] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl,  is this only for click type events then, or is all my code going to have to go in this callback?
[14:01:07] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: the function()s can be in external .js, only the click-handler adding should be there
[14:01:24] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, yeah but what if i have multiple different click handlers?
[14:01:55] <c0d3rg1rl> if jquery does not find the image-id on the page, it does nothing and skips it.
[14:02:02] <plln> then copy external js to main file
[14:02:28] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: as long as ids are different, all can be in load() callback
[14:02:35] <AdvoWork> plln, what do you mean, the external.js is linked from the main file already
[14:03:04] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, ah ok, but my other functions can remain as they are? are there alternatives to loading pages into a div, other than load() ?
[14:03:45] <plln> open a webdemo then we look
[14:03:48] <plln> for error
[14:05:30] <plln> 78.182.213.67 user:null password:null
[14:05:42] <plln> any idea will appricated
[14:06:36] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, thanks for all the help, and you plln
[14:06:43] <kristofer91> what function can i use to depending on which step i am on a form, to add in the url #step1, #step2 etc etc
[14:07:07] <plln> first clik to [+] link  opens iframe but not showing and second click loads iframe 4 times
[14:07:30] <AdvoWork> that callback thing appears to work; i dont know if this is a bad idea c0d3rg1rl but in my callback, i do call_add_product_callback_functions() { }  that function is in my external js file, which contains all my click events, and all my autocompletes etc, is that wrong?
[14:08:18] <plln> AdvoWork
[14:08:38] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: can't tell without taking a look at your framework...
[14:08:45] <plln> copy your js file content to main file <script> external js content </script> tag
[14:09:12] <AdvoWork> plln, but then i'm going to have 100's of lines of code, as ive got lots of code for each page if you get me
[14:09:32] <c0d3rg1rl> AdvoWork: if it works within load() now , use it like that.
[14:10:21] <plln> if you are using iframe use this for reachine your functions
[14:10:27] <AdvoWork> c0d3rg1rl, i was just wondering if its sort of bad to do this
[14:10:31] <plln> parent.$(parent.document).trigger("yourfunctionname");
[14:12:49] <plln> why one function called one times but works 4 times ?
[14:13:07] <c0d3rg1rl> plln: your file http://78.182.213.67/reseller/css/img/bg.png is actually  a jpg and contains an iframe-virus
[14:13:17] <c0d3rg1rl> you better delete it
[14:13:23] <plln> ok
[14:14:03] <plln> mv bg.png bg.png__OLD
[14:14:09] <plln> moved to bg.png__OLD
[14:14:20] <plln> it is not a virus
[14:14:34] <plln> its a background image
[14:14:41] <c0d3rg1rl> plln: if you take a look at it with some hex-editor, you can see a jpeg-header and lots of html at the end
[14:14:58] <plln> ok i am loking right now
[14:15:43] <c0d3rg1rl> If you load it into some gimp and re-save it as .png, that should be gone.
[14:16:30] <plln> thats not important
[14:16:33] <plln> i deleted
[14:16:52] <plln> i change bg later
[14:17:09] <plln> important problem is why iframe loads itself 4 times
[14:18:21] <Zzaichik> okay, so I can't put a conditional inside of .animate({..}); can I
[14:18:33] <plln> c0d3rg1rl: when you said there is a virus in a background
[14:18:40] <plln> a lot of people will connect to my machine
[14:19:04] <plln> omg almost 100 persons
[14:19:25] <plln> plase dont look for virus
[14:19:30] <plln> look for code
[14:19:51] <c0d3rg1rl> If my anti-virus warns at your page, I look why.
[14:20:43] <plln> it is still warn you ?
[14:21:00] <c0d3rg1rl> plln: so where is your problem?
[14:21:05] <c0d3rg1rl> no more warning.
[14:21:16] <c0d3rg1rl> plln: I am logged in, now what?
[14:21:34] <Abolfazl> How do I replace the text of an xpath element with jQuery?
[14:22:24] <plln> [+]
[14:22:26] <plln> click
[14:22:30] <plln> the [+]
[14:22:32] <plln> link
[14:22:38] <plln> its open a iframe
[14:22:52] <plln> but it only open when you click 2 or more times
[14:23:13] <plln> and you are not login at this moment
[14:23:15] <c0d3rg1rl> ah, did not see the [+], browser was not wide enough
[14:23:19] <plln> on my pc
[14:25:43] <plln> but script is fixed size
[14:26:06] <plln> browser width is not important
[14:26:39] <plln> 173.167.###.15
[14:26:43] <plln> you are my hope
[14:26:47] <Abolfazl> How do I replace the text of an xpath element with jQuery?
[14:26:57] <plln> you are almost 10 min looking plase catch somethink
[14:27:46] <plln> c0d3rg1rl: you are my second hope
[14:27:50] <Shai-Tan> I have some ui subtabs and I can target a subtab, but how do I have the appropriate (parent) tab selected?
[14:27:57] <Zzaichik> No Zz, you can't. Okay thank you. :\
[14:27:57] <jjames_> Question: in JQuery-UI selectable, there is a "cancel" option. Is there a way to trigger an event after the cancel fires?
[14:29:22] <plln> var ret = functionblablabla
[14:29:35] <plln> when user click it will be false
[14:29:43] <plln> ( click to cancel )
[14:29:56] <plln> if ( ret == false ) { trigerblablabla }
[14:32:11] <plln> any idea for my problem ( 78.182.213.67 )
[14:33:46] <plln> user: null pass:null
[14:34:05] <c0d3rg1rl> plln: I think the plugin does either add the handler multiple times or does not cancel the bubbling event
[14:34:30] <c0d3rg1rl> plln: with the very first click on one + it tries to load the page 2 times already.
[14:34:31] <plln> good
[14:34:37] <plln> how can i fix it
[14:34:54] <plln> i now when its open iframe page loaded 4 times
[14:34:57] <c0d3rg1rl> code a simple test-case page with the plugin.
[14:35:05] <plln> it works
[14:35:23] <plln> it was working with jquery 1.7.1
[14:35:27] <plln> i update jquery
[14:35:39] <plln> so it stop working
[14:36:01] <plln> and i need jquery 1.7.2  i can not do downgrade
[14:36:24] <plln> so i have to fix this problem
[14:36:43] <plln> but how
[14:37:03] <c0d3rg1rl> so you need to debug the plugin and narrow down the problem slowly.
[14:37:14] <c0d3rg1rl> have to leave, happy bug-hunting.
[14:37:28] <plln> nope i have another option
[14:37:38] <plln> i need another iframe plugin
[14:37:52] <plln> but this is so good
[14:42:02] <lenswipe> hey guys
[14:42:09] <lenswipe> anyone know of a good way to do date/time input?
[14:42:34] <pifantastic> ?g jquery ui datepicker time add on
[14:42:35] <bot-t> pifantastic, Adding a Timepicker to jQuery UI Datepicker - http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[14:42:55] <lenswipe> pifantastic, last time i used datepicker i dont remember it accepting time input
[14:43:03] <lenswipe> in other news im 99% sure you didnt read my question properly
[14:43:20] <pifantastic> lenswipe: that is a time addon for datepicker
[14:43:27] <pifantastic> that is exactly what you asked for
[14:43:52] <lenswipe> my apologies
[14:43:54] <lenswipe> thank you :)
[14:44:13] <lenswipe> does it support disabling of certain dates and times?
[14:44:17] <plln> pifantastic: do you have somethink for me ?
[14:44:29] <pifantastic> plln: what do you need>
[14:44:35] <plln> iframe
[14:44:39] <plln> good looking
[14:45:23] <plln> no not good looking
[14:45:26] <plln> good working
[14:45:39] <pifantastic> you need a good working iframe?
[14:45:50] <pifantastic> I'm going to need a lot more information than that
[14:46:02] <plln> ok
[14:46:17] <Shai-Tan> I have some ui subtabs and I can target a subtab, but how do I have the appropriate (parent) tab selected?
[14:46:24] <plln> at this time i am using top_up iframe plugin
[14:46:44] <plln> but it stops working when i update jquery to 1.7.2
[14:46:53] <pifantastic> Shai-Tan: Use jQuery to traverse up to the parent tab
[14:46:55] <plln> i cant downgrade jquery 1.7.1
[14:47:21] <plln> - 78.182.213.67  - user null -pass null
[14:47:41] <plln> when you login click the any of  [+] link
[14:47:57] <plln> it will not open iframe at first time
[14:48:14] <plln> its open when you click the link 2 -3 -4 times
[14:49:00] <plln> firstly i wanna fix the problem if i can not i have to change plugin to another iframe plugin
[14:49:01] <pifantastic> plln: can you paste the relevant code?
[14:49:20] <plln> if you want i can sen you all the script :D
[14:49:49] <plln> http://gettopup.com/examples <-- here is the orginal publisher
[14:50:13] <pifantastic> plln: sorry plln, I don't have time to debug your entire app
[14:50:27] <plln> <script src="download.js"><a id="n" href="print.php?couponID='.$entry['cell']['ID'].'" class="tu_iframe_600x430">Detay</a>
[14:50:30] <plln> thats all
[14:50:48] <plln> <a id=n href="print.php?couponID=XXXX" class="tu_iframe_600x430">Detay</a>
[14:51:03] <plln> it is automatically open iframe width 600*430px
[14:51:47] <plln> if you want the js source
[14:52:11] <plln> http://gettopup.com/releases/packed/1.7.2.zip  <-- you can download from here
[14:52:51] <plln> - 78.182.213.67/js/toup.js
[14:53:03] <plln> - 78.182.213.67/reseller/js/toup.js
[14:53:22] <plln> this is the javascript library
[14:55:59] <plln> any idea
[14:58:32] <Taktaal> you need to formulate the question better
[14:58:47] <Taktaal> separate the problem, build a test case, then copy it to a pasteboard
[14:59:27] <Advocated> if loading contents of another page into a div, using load() and then in the load callback calling a function (function callbacks()) which basically contains a list of click event handlers etc, is there any reason why these would only work once?
[14:59:55] <plln> ok
[14:59:57] <plln> one sec
[15:02:09] <Advocated> what are the benefits of using ajax instead of load to load content into an element?
[15:03:28] <coldhead> ajax gives you more configuration options should you require them
[15:03:37] <nFFF> Advocated, load is ajax
[15:03:40] <nFFF> just shorthand
[15:03:42] <coldhead> load is just a simplified wrapper around ajax()
[15:03:52] <coldhead> for designers
[15:03:55] <coldhead> and mouth breathers
[15:03:57] <nFFF> :>>
[15:03:58] <Taktaal> using load you have to do the formatting on the ajax server side
[15:04:07] <Taktaal> which isn't so good usually
[15:04:42] <nFFF> I like load when the server returns a html string
[15:04:45] <Advocated> nFFF, im having major problems, basically, i was loading pages into a div which is on a main page, which appeared to be working fine, but i've spotted a problem so am looking for alternatives
[15:04:47] <nFFF> useful for loading section of a page
[15:04:48] <jjames_> http://jsfiddle.net/2QD4X/ note this example. Is it possible to fire an event when it's "canceled"? (when you have already selected an item, it doesn't deselect everything if you click on it again - I want it to do something else)
[15:04:58] <nFFF> Advocated
[15:05:01] <nFFF> wha problem?
[15:05:23] <nFFF> ?preventdefault @ jjames_
[15:05:24] <bot-t> jjames_, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[15:05:24] <plln> http://localhost/reseller/test.php
[15:05:30] <plln> here is the simple problem
[15:05:48] <plln> it contains 10 - 20 row code
[15:05:53] <Taktaal> uhm plln...
[15:06:00] <Taktaal> seriously?
[15:06:19] <Advocated> nFFF, basically, i had a click element which the first time i loaded the page(the click element was for the page im opening) it works fine, and runs the click handler.. but then if i reclick the link (so re call the load()  so the page is loaded again) then next time, when i click my element it runs the code twice, because its loading the content twice if you get me?
[15:06:22] <plln> it just a <a href="#">link</a>
[15:06:31] <Taktaal> you just pasted a link to localhost
[15:06:34] <Taktaal> think about it...
[15:07:01] <plln> ah sorry
[15:07:03] <plln> :D
[15:07:21] <plln> 78.182.213.67/reseller/test.php
[15:07:26] <jjames_> nFFF: thank you - in that example, do I remove the "cancel" and replace it with a separate line which is $(".selected-ui").preventDefault() instead?
[15:07:50] <nFFF> I havent actually looked at your code jjames_ :D
[15:07:51] <nFFF> one sec
[15:07:57] <jjames_> lol np
[15:08:17] <nFFF> Advocated
[15:08:37] <nFFF> Im slightly confused, are you loading in the same markup as already on he page
[15:08:41] <nFFF> i.e. duplicated the page
[15:08:53] <plln> if you want to runtime look
[15:09:05] <plln> 78.182.213.67/reseller/index.php user null pass null
[15:10:13] <Advocated> nFFF, basically, main.html has a div on it, and a hy[erlink, onclick of the hyperlink it loads secondarypage.html into the div. On secondarypage i've got stuff, such as a hyperlink that is for a click handler. This works fine, and would say call alert();  the problem is, if a user reclicks that hyperlink on the main page(thus load(secondarypage again) then when they click the link on the secondary page it fires twice. get me?>
[15:10:42] <nFFF> jjames_, ok I haven';t used selectable before
[15:11:21] <plln> any idea ?
[15:12:27] <nFFF> Advocated
[15:12:33] <nFFF> so your issue is loading the same page twice really
[15:12:44] <nFFF> why would you want duplicate hyperlinks/elements like this?
[15:12:46] <jjames_> nFFF np thank you for the time anyway :D
[15:12:54] <Advocated> yeah, i've tried things like unbind etc etc
[15:13:19] <Advocated> nFFF, i dont, basically the link from the main page is unique, i assumed that the load content was unique too, but this isnt obv the case
[15:13:35] <Advocated> i really dont know what to do
[15:13:47] <Advocated> nFFF, out of interest, you in UK?
[15:14:44] <nFFF> Yes
[15:14:49] <nFFF> so after the first load
[15:14:53] <nFFF> don't let them load again?
[15:14:57] <Taktaal> advocated: could your browser maybe be requesting a favicon?
[15:15:45] <Advocated> nFFF, how do i stop it loading again though? there are multiple links from the main page that get loaded if you get me
[15:15:57] <Advocated> nFFF, where in the UK if you don't mind me asking?
[15:16:19] <nFFF> Manchester
[15:16:22] <nFFF> how come? :>
[15:16:24] <Advocated> Taktaal, its not that I don't think
[15:16:40] <Advocated> nFFF, was wondering if you were close to me, i wouldave asked you to come and help lol (brum)
[15:16:54] <nFFF> Advocated, post your code ?demo
[15:17:01] <nFFF> lol i got work tomrorow :>
[15:17:07] <plln> http://localhost/reseller/test.php
[15:17:20] <plln> 78.182.213.67/reseller/test.php
[15:17:23] <plln> here is the demo
[15:17:26] <Advocated> i tried doing things such as if the div im loading stuff into is already present remove it, then reload it, but it didnt work, and i can't post a fully working one because jsfiddle for example won't allow remote links so I cant get it to load, get me?
[15:17:33] <plln> ups
[15:17:37] <plln> i need to sleep
[15:17:47] <ringotwo_> advocated, are you binding click behaviors to the links?
[15:17:48] <plln> good night
[15:18:27] <Advocated> ringotwo_, do you mean on the link i'm clicking to load() stuff, or a link on the page that has been loaded?
[15:18:29] <ringotwo_> it sounds like you're binding a click behavior twice to the same link
[15:19:02] <Advocated> the thing is, im duplicating it i think, because im loading the content again if you get me, or so i've been told? :S
[15:19:05] <ringotwo_> if a link is getting fired off twice with one click... is that that issue
[15:19:18] <ringotwo_> is that the issue, i mean
[15:19:31] <ringotwo_> content is loaded twice with one click?
[15:19:41] <nFFF> Advocated, I don't fully grasp what you are doing, why you are doing it, or what the issue is
[15:19:49] <nFFF> so without seeing code i cant help
[15:19:51] <nFFF> :<
[15:19:57] <Advocated> nFFF, lemme see if i can post an example
[15:20:40] <ringotwo_> if content is loading twice with one click, try to unbind() before assigning any click behaviors to it
[15:20:54] <nFFF> As far as I can tell you have a link, that a user clicks, and it loads some more html, and then they click it again and it loads the same html again
[15:20:59] <nFFF> which in itself seems pointless
[15:21:14] <ringotwo_> $('.link').unbind('click').click( ...
[15:21:38] <ringotwo_> html might get updated between clicks
[15:23:24] <Advocated> ringotwo_, i tried using unbind before but no luck
[15:23:33] <nFFF> your first issue is
[15:23:44] <nFFF> why are you loading duplicate html into the DOM?
[15:23:50] <nFFF> whats the reasoning
[15:24:10] <Advocated> i didnt mean to be, i thought by load() ing it was loading my content/page again
[15:24:24] <nFFF> and this new html you are loading, is it just html or is it js as well?
[15:24:27] <Advocated> hence my issue, ive only just realised its doing this, and is now causing major issues
[15:24:27] <ringotwo_> you need to post an example
[15:24:34] <ringotwo_> it's useless trying to diagnose like this
[15:24:40] <Advocated> nFFF, thats the prob, its html, with js on it too
[15:24:44] <Advocated> im trying to post an example, sec
[15:25:08] <nFFF> Advocated, have you considered perhaps you have a larger design flaw here
[15:25:36] <Advocated> nFFF, yeah but i didn't realise that til after, which is what im trying to solve
[15:26:03] <nFFF> Your explanation is so vague no one knows what your actually triyng to solve :|
[15:27:01] <Advocated> nFFF, im trying to post some example, gimme a few, its long winded lol
[15:31:26] <_zoggy_> anyone here famaliar with ANT and build scripts?
[15:32:34] <ProLoser|Work> is it common practice to use .not() next to .siblings() when selecting more than 1 original element?
[15:32:44] <ProLoser|Work> in a set?
[15:33:05] <ProLoser|Work> like $target = $('.target'); $target.siblings().not($target).whatever();
[15:33:12] <ProLoser|Work> or am i doing it wrong
[15:33:43] <nFFF> sure
[15:33:55] <nFFF> you can also use :not
[15:34:07] <nFFF> but its not common practise to us $ for variable names
[15:34:10] <nFFF> this aint php :D
[15:34:45] <Advocated> nFFF, this is near impossible for me to show you this, because of the problem ive changed so much code trying to get it working. I'm trying to construct something with basic code: http://jsfiddle.net/mCGfh/  does this even help what so ever? basically the main page has hyperlinks, which call a load function, this basically loads another page(in this case add_product.html) into my div on the main page. This works fine. I have hyperlinks on the add_p
[15:34:45] <Advocated> roducts which fire say an alert, so on edit(alert()) also fine, BUT if the user clicks add_products again, which will run the load bit again, thus reloading the add_products.html) into the div, when i click edit, it fires the click handler twice, if i click add products 5 times, and then click edit, it alerts 5 times(i assume cuz the code has loaded 5 times?)
[15:35:22] <Advocated> nFFF, each of the pages i load into the div contain html and JS.. so i know i'm repeating code each load, but i didnt realise I was doing that
[15:36:55] <Advocated> i know this is excessively difficult for you to imageine due to the lack of my code samples, but i don't know what else i can show, as i've had to try and fix it today, which hasnt worked
[15:37:29] <Advocated> ive tried things like unbind, ive tried removing the div im loading into, and re doing that, but its like the jquery etc has already been loaded into the dom?
[15:37:57] <nFFF> Ok so first step
[15:38:09] <nFFF> is removing the js from add_products.html
[15:39:32] <nFFF> and having one click event on the original apge
[15:39:40] <nFFF> bind the click event to the parent containing element
[15:39:47] <nFFF> and use delgation via on()
[15:40:39] <Advocated> so the click is binded to the hyperlink on the main page?
[15:41:00] <acidjazz> ill bind ur mom
[15:41:03] <acidjazz> to my hyperlink
[15:41:11] <acidjazz> in a main way
[15:41:59] <nFFF> Advocated
[15:42:03] <nFFF> i can't help sorry
[15:42:19] <nFFF> your loading a file that has duplicate html and js code in it multiple times
[15:42:30] <nFFF> and asking why events are being fired multiple times
[15:42:46] <nFFF> can you not see the craziness to your issue
[15:42:52] <nFFF> or even more the actual solution
[15:43:13] <Advocated> yes i can, as i've repeatedly said.. its just fixing it isn't appearing to be that easy
[15:43:43] <nFFF> Simple logic dictates if you load multiple duplicate html and js and its causing multiple click events
[15:43:52] <nFFF> whats the answer/
[15:44:04] <nFFF> don't load multiple duplicate html and js
[15:44:14] <nFFF> i.e. modify your add_product.html
[15:44:20] <nFFF> ..
[15:44:24] <Advocated> and kevin, aka acidjazz i'll also bind yours :p
[15:45:38] <Advocated> nFFF, what i've been trying to do is remove all js out of the html files and put into external files linked from the main page, but then content isn't loading like i think we went over earlier, so been using load callbacks, which was getting me there, but hit more issues
[15:46:28] <nFFF> yea your issue is your trying to do something which is out of your capabilitie
[15:46:33] <nFFF> you really need to do some reading
[15:46:35] <nFFF> and come back to this
[15:47:11] <Advocated> easier said than done sometimes, especially when i've been doing this for a while and have only just spotted the bug :S but i shall continue working through it and tidying it up etc
[15:47:35] <nFFF> but its just craziness
[15:47:46] <nFFF> your loading duplicate js/html multiple times
[15:47:53] <nFFF> and the solution is to simply not do this
[15:47:56] <nFFF> its really simple
[15:48:08] <nFFF> don't load duplicate js and html
[15:48:29] <Advocated> yes, but as i've said, i didnt realise it was doing this.... i assumed that loading it was loading it fresh, so each time it was loading the content, not sort of appending (i know it doesn't as such) thats what I was looking for, and then came to load, it appeared to work and I didnt spot the problem :S
[15:48:47] <nFFF> What difference does it make if you realised or not
[15:48:52] <nFFF> jsut change it so it doesnt...
[15:49:37] <Advocated> as i've said, easier said than done, but I'm trying to, but am hitting more and more problems, out of interest, does jquery have something that doesn't duplicate code, ie loads it fresh/new each time?
[15:50:31] <nFFF> do you have a working site
[15:50:36] <nFFF> or is it on localhost
[15:50:44] <Advocated> localhost unfortunately
[15:50:56] <nFFF> use $.ajax for more control
[15:51:07] <nFFF> but you can just load it to a new contianer
[15:51:09] <nFFF> and delete old
[15:51:59] <Advocated> by loading into a new container, do you mean with $.ajax?  how come load can't do this?
[15:53:48] <nFFF> var old = $('.container'); $old.after('<div class="new"><div>'); $('.new').load(url); old.remove();
[15:54:18] <nFFF> but really at this point you'd be better using ajax
[15:54:23] <Advocated> should that work with what i've got though? im pretty sure ive tried that earlier, or could that be something else causing it to "not work"
[15:54:37] <Advocated> i'm trying to read what ajax has got over load in these kind of circumstances
[15:54:58] <nFFF> $.ajax(url, function(data) { $('.foo').replaceWith(data); });
[15:55:55] <upstream> I'm using jQuery Templates and everything works fine, however when I open my index file in Safari by dragging into the browser: eg using file:///etc/index.html the Template doesn't render and there is no errors. confused!
[15:56:31] <nFFF> becuase load literally loads html into an element
[15:57:23] <nFFF> it's callback function is after the new content is loaded to the DOM
[15:57:33] <nFFF> whereas iwth AJAX its after a successful resonse
[15:57:40] <nFFF> so you have more control over the data
[15:58:14] <Advocated> does that mean using load is basically loading my html(and therefore the JS on that page) into the dom, and its causing a problem the next time cuz its there twice, but ajax is replacing that?
[15:58:42] <nFFF> kind of
[15:58:53] <nFFF> load is a short hand and specific way of calling ajax
[15:59:01] <nFFF> ajax allows more control
[15:59:06] <nFFF> if you call it explicitly
[15:59:19] <nFFF> ajax can do the exact same as load
[15:59:28] <CrossX> I have an issue with jquery UI tabs.  It seems when I use another timed AJAX event unrelated to the tabs it causes the "select" event in the tabs to fire off once per milisecond for every tab.
[15:59:34] <Advocated> so what stops the js code on my new page being duplicated with using ajax instead though, or do you mean ajax can stop this occuring?
[15:59:46] <nFFF> obser: $.ajax(url, function(data) { $('.foo').append(data); })
[15:59:50] <nFFF> this is exact same as
[15:59:58] <nFFF> $('foo').load(url);
[16:00:02] <millermedeiros> I asked it earlier and got no answer.. anyone knows a jquery plugin for keyboard events that works with event delegation and $.fn.on() ? I would like to do something like: $('#foo').on('keypress.return', '.bar', doSomething);
[16:00:23] <nFFF> yes exacrlt you can do wahtever you want with the data in $.ajax
[16:00:28] <nFFF> where load will append it to the element
[16:00:37] <nFFF> you can change .append to ?replacewhite
[16:00:42] <nFFF> ?replacewith for instance
[16:00:43] <bot-t> nFFF, .replaceWith() - Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[16:01:39] <CrossX> can anyone help me with jquery UI tab events?
[16:01:48] <DofLeFou> Greetings guys
[16:02:00] <Advocated> ahh ok, so the data is my html page (html and js code) can i still leave it on there though, i mean, by having js code in the html, that isn't getting duplicated? is it sort of easy as saying, don't include this part of the data, OR is it case of you can include it all, but i'm replacing(not adding to it) sorry if im going over it i just want to make sure im clear
[16:02:24] <LakWork> i have the following event handler: $('#forgot-password-btn, .submit-login-email-to-password-reset').on('click', function(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); ... }
[16:02:37] <LakWork> both of the matched elements are a tags with an href set
[16:02:46] <nFFF> $.ajax(url, function(data) { /* do whatever you want with data */ });
[16:03:20] <LakWork> when i click the first one the behavior works exactly as it should and the link click is not executed. when i click the second one, the logic is executed but then the link click still executes after my javascript
[16:04:06] <Advocated> nFFF, ok, ill have a play with that. please check your pm though(non question related if you don't mind).
[16:04:32] <DofLeFou> I have the following Ajax POST https://gist.github.com/2004241 â€¦. it works fine on all browsers except on SAFARI (5.1.2 ) â€¦ it works on previous version of Safari â€¦ oddly the POST only fails on every other request â€¦ I m a little lost .. please advise
[16:04:45] <nFFF> Advocated, just start with this exact code: $.ajax(url, function(data) { $('.foo').replaceWith(data); }); //change foo to your element class
[16:04:52] <realtime> why the button isn't firing the event? http://jsfiddle.net/YFudu/
[16:05:45] <nFFF> realtime
[16:05:49] <Advocated> nFFF, ok, ill give that a try tomorrow then, ive not got the code here now, hopefully that will fix my issue!
[16:05:51] <realtime> yes?
[16:05:55] <Advocated> appreciate the help!
[16:05:55] <nFFF> real cool of you to inline the js
[16:06:04] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/YFudu/1/
[16:06:22] <CrossX> I could use some help with JQuery UI tabs, if anyone has a moment.
[16:06:55] <CrossX> http://lando.panduck.com/  <-- jquery UI tabs execute "select" event for no reason when I use another AJAX timed function
[16:06:56] <Advocated> right, thanks again nFFF
[16:06:58] <Advocated> laters!!
[16:07:02] <nFFF> bye
[16:07:30] <realtime> nFFF: on my application, what is the equivalent of putting the js on jsfiddle bottom window? putting it in a file?
[16:08:00] <DofLeFou> realtime: try â€¦ $("#search").click(function (e) { â€¦ });
[16:08:50] <DofLeFou> any why are you wrapping it around document.ready
[16:09:20] <DofLeFou> that might be you problem
[16:09:23] <DofLeFou> your
[16:09:49] <realtime> DofLeFou, I don't follow, wrapping what around?
[16:09:52] <DofLeFou> I have the following Ajax POST https://gist.github.com/2004241 â€¦. it works fine on all browsers except on SAFARI (5.1.2 ) â€¦ it works on previous version of Safari â€¦ oddly the POST only fails on every other request â€¦ I m a little lost .. please advise
[16:10:15] <DofLeFou> realtime: http://jsfiddle.net/YFudu/
[16:11:01] <realtime> that's my post, yes.
[16:11:53] <Abolfazl> How would I change the text of a certain element with Jquery and xpath?
[16:11:54] <Abolfazl> $("span").text("<b>Hello world!</b>"); changes all elements of span but changing span with my desired xpath location /html/body/div/table[2]/tbody/tr[4]/td[18]/p/span doesnt work
[16:13:44] <quazimodo> guys, is it acceptable to paste in multiple $(document).ready(); in different places in my code, or must i locate the single definition and put anything i want in there
[16:14:03] <CrossX> quazimodo.  in my experince it's ok
[16:14:16] <quazimodo> kk
[16:14:41] <jaha> is scrollTo still supported? whats the best way to mimic that, to scroll within a div?
[16:14:55] <CrossX> jaha: ele.scrolltop
[16:15:02] <CrossX> jaha: ele.scrollTop
[16:15:06] <jaha> horizontally...
[16:15:22] <CrossX> jaha ele.scrollLeft
[16:15:46] <quazimodo> CrossX: <script type="text/javascript"> $(docment).ready( $("#some-link img").hover ( etc etc ... </script> placed in the block that contains the image should be ok, then?
[16:16:22] <CrossX> quazimodo:  it should be ok, but you need to test it, and it will change on different doctypes (probably)
[16:17:41] <CrossX> can anyone help me with jquery UI tabs?  When using an unrelated AJAX request it causes the UI tabs to fire the 'onselected' event over and over for every tab.  http://lando.panduck.com/
[16:18:26] <CrossX> this is my last hope.  If I can't find a solution to this bug I have to abandon jquery ui all together
[16:19:20] <quazimodo> CrossX: bleh lol all i want is a simple image roll on mouseover
[16:19:21] <quazimodo> haha
[16:19:57] <CrossX> quazimodo: hunchbacks shouldn't laugh at other people's problems =P
[16:20:58] <quazimodo> CrossX: its my own problem! :P
[16:22:12] <CrossX> quazimodo: your hover script should work, but not all doctypes support placing <script> blocks outside of the <head> section, but even then most browsers will still execute it.
[16:22:51] <jaha> i have scrollbars in my div but $('div.modal').animate({scrollLeft: 20}, 'slow'); doesnt work
[16:23:52] <jaha> is the scroll relative to the div or the window?
[16:24:45] <CrossX> jaha: do you have a functional example?
[16:26:09] <CrossX> is there nobody that can help with jquery ui tabs?
[16:26:20] <cesaro> i am getting an 'Expected identifier number et all' from internet explorere when using jeditable for inline editing of a datatable.
[16:26:31] <cesaro> anyone ever seen this?
[16:27:47] <ch3mical> You probably mean "Unexpected identifier"
[16:27:52] <quazimodo> CrossX: wish i could help ya but im a noob
[16:28:02] <quazimodo> also my script sucks :D
[16:28:15] <ch3mical> CrossX, I could, but I was actually leaving, just poked my head in for a sec
[16:28:35] <CrossX> thanks guys the empathy does help
[16:29:00] <cesaro> it definitely says expected ch3mical
[16:29:31] <cesaro> "Expected identifier, string or number" jquery.jeditable.js line 478
[16:29:49] <cesaro> the line itself in the source is: eval ('var json = ' + string);
[16:31:13] <jaha> nevermind, to many divs flying around, i was selecting the wrong one
[16:31:48] <CrossX> cesaro, IMHO anything that uses the eval function should be avoided like the plague
[16:32:04] <cesaro> unfortunately i am a bit too deep into reliable on datatables.editable to quit now.
[16:32:12] <cesaro> relying, rather.
[16:32:33] <CrossX> cesaro, sorry, too cryptic for me
[16:32:49] <MikeyD> putting this in a document head should run everything, right? http://jsfiddle.net/gJUsk/
[16:33:01] <cesaro> anothe rones that just come ot light, im using a jquery .hide/.show and dropdown even to show something when you hit a button
[16:33:20] <cesaro> in real browsers it pushes down that which is below it, but in ie is dries to draw itself on top of the table beneath it
[16:34:50] <MikeyD> for some reason everything works here: http://jsfiddle.net/6vTwj/ but when i put stuff on the live site, the javascript stops functioning
[16:35:00] <eddiemonge> MikeyD: it be better in the footer and delete the window.load part
[16:35:25] <CrossX> MikeyD.  try $(function(){ ... }) instead of $(window).load()
[16:35:39] <eddiemonge> no, just delete the window.load part
[16:37:09] <CrossX> I need help with jquery UI tabs, is there anyone that can help me?
[16:37:15] <eddiemonge> MikeyD: http://jsfiddle.net/gJUsk/1/
[16:37:21] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ CrossX
[16:37:22] <bot-t> CrossX, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:37:31] <eddiemonge> MikeyD: what doctype are you using?
[16:37:39] <CrossX> eddiemonge, scroll back, I asked numerious times
[16:38:22] <CrossX>  When using an unrelated AJAX request it causes the UI tabs to fire the 'onselected' event over and over for every tab.  http://lando.panduck.com/
[16:38:24] <eddiemonge> i see that you asked numerous times but i see no question
[16:38:47] <MikeyD> eddiemonge: using html5. and the javascript now works with that updated jsfiddle
[16:38:51] <eddiemonge> that is a lot of tabs
[16:39:09] <eddiemonge> MikeyD: dont use CDATA and you dont need type="text/javascript"
[16:39:10] <CrossX> it sucks when they all fire their events at the same time over and over again
[16:39:26] <eddiemonge> CrossX: you might want to look at ways of improving that UI
[16:39:30] <CrossX> "select" should only fire when the tab has been clicked on
[16:39:49] <CrossX> it's a work in progress, as far as imporving the UI, talk to the jquery ui team
[16:39:54] <MikeyD> eddiemonge: although when i click hide, my header disappears and the button goes somewhere else. i am assuming that is a css thing i need to fix.
[16:39:56] <eddiemonge> why jquery 1.4.2?
[16:40:15] <eddiemonge> MikeyD: probably. you didnt include any of that so i cant say
[16:40:54] <CrossX> eddiemonge, watch the console (firebug) for network traffic after about 30 seconds
[16:41:24] <CrossX> these urls are only attached to the href of the tabs and should only fire when clicked
[16:41:26] <MikeyD> eddiemonge: well, thank you very much for helping me with the javascript part.
[16:41:42] <CrossX> this bug only occurs when an unrelated ajax function is used
[16:41:45] <eddiemonge> CrossX: why the mix of manual ajax and jquery? why not use jquery all the way
[16:41:50] <CrossX> I was using $.AJAX but
[16:42:01] <CrossX> I thought it might be causing the conflict
[16:42:19] <CrossX> so I used a generic function to try and avoid messing up the 'select' event on the tabsa
[16:42:26] <CrossX> same behaviour
[16:42:57] <CrossX> do you see the select events going all crazy?
[16:43:41] <eddiemonge> CrossX: you have setTimeout calling itself repeatedly
[16:43:56] <CrossX> with a 5-10 second delay
[16:43:59] <eddiemonge> you need that caller in an else statement
[16:44:25] <CrossX> caller in an else statment?
[16:44:47] <eddiemonge> if(window.activeTimeout){ } else {   window.activeTabProc)
[16:45:13] <CrossX> ummm ... why?
[16:45:26] <eddiemonge> what exactly is not working?
[16:45:49] <eddiemonge> and as far as the UI, the jqui team has nothing to do with your layout
[16:46:07] <eddiemonge> im saying having a billion tabs like that isnt the most user friendly ui
[16:46:51] <CrossX> do you see where the select event is declared for the tabs?
[16:47:01] <CrossX> that event is fireing even when the tabs are not selected
[16:47:11] <CrossX> when I use an ajax function that is completly unrelated
[16:47:20] <CrossX> if I don't use the ajax function it works fine
[16:47:42] <CrossX> this is the ajax function: getResponse('totalBlocksCut','totalBlocksCut',10000);
[16:48:10] <MikeyD> eddiemonge: omg got it working perfectly. thank you so much
[16:48:47] <CrossX> somehow getResponse() causes the jquery UI tabs 'select' event to fire
[16:48:54] <eddiemonge> take out that line
[16:49:16] <CrossX> yes, it works fine without that line, but I want to add that line
[16:49:22] <CrossX> thats why I'm here
[16:49:29] <eddiemonge> just take it out for now so i can troubleshoot your code
[16:49:33] <CrossX> oh ok
[16:49:47] <CrossX> its done
[16:50:11] <CrossX> when you're looking at a tab, the tab's content will refresh once every 5 seconds
[16:50:20] <CrossX> works fine now
[16:50:40] <CrossX> on tab select a timer is started that reloads the currently selected tab
[16:51:41] <CrossX> how the other ajax even is even related to the jquery ui tabs is beyond my understanding
[16:52:21] <CrossX> as far as I can tell, the two shouldn't effect eachother in any way
[16:53:26] <CrossX> thanks for helping me eddiemonge
[16:53:37] <eddiemonge> again, why are you using 1.4.2?
[16:54:00] <CrossX> no reason
[16:54:24] <eddiemonge> you should update since its a couple of years ok
[16:54:42] <CrossX> done
[16:55:11] <CrossX> added breaky code back into the file
[16:55:23] <CrossX> same bug occurs
[16:55:43] <CrossX> ok, so the old jquery src isn't the problme
[16:55:58] <CrossX> should I remove the line that causes the bug?
[16:57:35] <eddiemonge> CrossX: its not the tabs generating the reloads
[16:57:37] <eddiemonge> its your script
[16:57:45] <eddiemonge> getResponse.apply(arguments)
[16:57:50] <eddiemonge> in the setTimeout
[16:57:59] <CrossX> oh shit
[16:58:07] <CrossX> it should say apply(this,arguments)
[16:58:21] <eddiemonge> that do you think that is supposed to do
[16:58:37] <CrossX> wait, it does say apply(this,arugments)
[16:59:07] <CrossX> where the heck is it getting the tabs URLs from?
[16:59:36] <eddiemonge> responder.php?requestId='
[16:59:42] <eddiemonge> from getResponse
[17:00:09] <CrossX> the tabs are the only ones that use numbers for the requestId so the URL is coming from the tabs somehow
[17:00:35] <CrossX> the getResponse() function should be calling the URL ...php?requestId=blockscut
[17:01:06] <eddiemonge> no its not
[17:01:11] <eddiemonge> look at your function
[17:01:33] <eddiemonge> then look at the query string parameters that are being called: requestId:undefined
[17:02:06] <martisj> if i want to preload an image and use it in a .css(background-image, '') call, can I do var image = new Image(); image.src = 'path/to/gif'; and call .css('background-image
[17:02:32] <martisj> ', 'url(' + image + ')';
[17:03:09] <CrossX> I think I see what's wrong... the def of arguments has changed
[17:03:38] <eddiemonge> martisj: sure. try it
[17:03:58] <CrossX> ok that fixed it
[17:04:05] <CrossX> thanks eddie
[17:04:05] <martisj> eddiemonge: yeah i should've just tried it before asking.
[17:04:06] <martisj> :D
[17:04:45] <CrossX> eddie this page is a proof of concept and not the finished UI FYI, the # of tabs will be decreased when I'm done
[17:04:49] <eddiemonge> CrossX: again, what do you think this is doing?: getResponse.apply(this,[id, elementId, interval]);
[17:05:07] <CrossX> eddie, this works
[17:05:20] <eddiemonge> please answer the question
[17:05:23] <CrossX> it's passing the same arguments to the timeout function as were passed to the function initally
[17:05:49] <CrossX> that is to say the function 'applied' in the timeout
[17:06:11] <eddiemonge> in order to call itself again right?
[17:06:19] <martisj> eddiemonge: it still takes a bit of time to show up when I click the button where I want to change the background-image.
[17:06:32] <CrossX> my mistake was uing the arugments.  I thought it was grabbing the arguments array from the getResponse() object but it was coming from the anon I used in the timout function
[17:06:34] <martisj> this is what I call: $(this).css('background-image', "url(" + image + ")");  in a .click event
[17:06:39] <CrossX> yes to call itself agqain and again
[17:06:53] <CrossX> if you look at the page now you can see what that does
[17:07:07] <eddiemonge> why not just call itself again then? getResponse(id, elementId, interval);
[17:07:08] <CrossX> real time updates of the blocks mined
[17:07:30] <CrossX> can't think of a good reason right now eddie
[17:07:49] <eddiemonge> i find simplest is usually good
[17:07:50] <CrossX> I really wanted to use the arguments arrary so I wouldn't have to type so much
[17:08:08] <CrossX> I'm thinking of making it a string so I don't eventually run out of stack space
[17:08:56] <eddiemonge> also, doing it this way, you may get responses out of order
[17:09:48] <CrossX> there's a 10 second delay between updates and the query (eventaully) should take less than a second to execute so crossed responses is not an issue
[17:10:24] <martisj> eddiemonge: i can see the image loads in the safari web inspector, but when i click the submit button it doesn't work.
[17:10:37] <martisj> *work: change to the animated gif.
[17:10:54] <eddiemonge> CrossX: you still have network latency, server delays and other things
[17:11:25] <eddiemonge> animated gif?
[17:11:47] <CrossX> eddiemonge: it's ok, this count thing is not mission critical
[17:13:07] <martisj> eddiemonge: yes.

[17:14:33] <CrossX> thanks again for your help eddie, I'm outa here
[17:14:39] <mszola> Hey. I'm having an issue with the overlay showing on jquery dialog in jquery UI.  All the info is there, but the modal div is apparently not expanding.
[17:14:46] <eddiemonge> martisj: i think you want image.src
[17:15:07] <martisj> eddiemonge: oh yeah probably :)
[17:15:11] <martisj> eddiemonge: thanks :D
[17:17:20] <mszola> is anyone familiar with jquery UI dialog? My modal background is not showing. The div does exist, and the css has the background correctly (both checked in firebug)
[17:17:27] <mszola> http://pastie.org/3552480
[17:17:41] <mszola> I have "modal: true" in the code like I am supposed to
[17:17:58] <mszola> the window itself comes up perfectly.
[17:30:42] <ihdev> I am writing a function to append an li to the DOM using jQuery .append() - but I am putting it in a function... why does the element only remain appended when I return false from the function?
[17:37:04] <coldhead> ihdev: are you using an <a> ?
[17:37:13] <coldhead> you may be reloading the page, and losing your modification
[17:41:30] <ihdev> coldhead: jsFiddle is down for me atm so I can't show you - stand by, ty
[17:42:13] <coldhead> jsbin.com or tinkerbin
[17:42:19] <coldhead> ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD
[17:42:44] <aqeel> coldhead u there?
[17:43:07] <coldhead> sure aqeel, why not
[17:43:41] <aqeel> what happened....yesterday....bot_t gave me a message.....I WILL NEVER FORGET AQEEL...............
[17:44:36] <coldhead> aw bot-t
[17:44:41] <coldhead> he's so sentimental
[17:45:28] <aqeel> oh ok...
[17:45:43] <tw2113> bot-t: do you love aqeel ?
[17:45:44] <bot-t> tw2113, Outlook not so good.
[17:45:53] <tw2113> doh
[17:46:13] <tw2113> well...this is awkward now
[17:46:21] <aqeel> u saw me ???relying on imaginations
[17:46:58] <aqeel> never go on looks go on deeds.....innersight of individual....
[17:47:54] <aqeel> even if one is black....or have burned face.....go for what he is capable of....might be step one or two ahead of what u have imagined
[17:48:14] <coldhead> this is why we will never forget you, aqeel
[17:48:20] <coldhead> true wisdom of hidden things
[17:48:26] <coldhead> to the glory of thine ineffable name
[17:49:08] <ihdev> coldhead: if the trigger button for the function call is a type=submit would that explain the page rfresh?
[17:50:28] <coldhead> it sure would, ihdev !
[17:50:34] <coldhead> you're submitting the form when you click it
[17:50:50] <coldhead> you have to return false or use ?preventdefault
[17:50:50] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[17:50:57] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[17:50:57] * bot-t sighs
[17:51:16] <ihdev> coldhead: ahhh ty that makes a lot of sense... in my case i was using a modal() call from the twitter bootstrap scaffolding and didn't look at the html in detail
[17:51:20] <ihdev> coldhead: ty!!
[17:51:30] <coldhead> good luck ihdev
[17:56:42] <atxq> I have a div within a div. After I click the div (inside) I want to run a function only on this div and I want to use $("div").click.... So is it possible to "break" somehow in this situation?
[17:57:49] <chovy> atxq: you want to prevent the bubbling?
[17:57:57] <chovy> e.stopPropagation()
[17:57:58] <coldhead> if $(this).has('div')) return;
[17:58:00] <atxq> I believe so
[17:58:48] <atxq> so its called bubbling?
[17:59:02] <coldhead> RandalSchwartz calls it rippling
[17:59:05] <coldhead> which is also nice
[17:59:14] <chovy> bubbling is what happens if you click a child element. The event bubbles up so a click handler is fired on all ancestors.
[17:59:23] <chovy> of course if you don't define one, nothing happens.
[17:59:24] <coldhead> but yes, the key idea is fluid dynamics
[17:59:33] <atxq> thanks
[17:59:34] <chovy> But it's possible to stop the bubbling with e.stopPropagation()
[18:02:04] <atxq> thanks guys, e.stopPropagation()
[18:02:11] <atxq> worked perfect
[18:02:45] <atxq> thanks chovy
[18:06:28] <aqeel> well i would say bubble is better than ripple..........ripple is always in chain .....bubble u can choose which to pop
[18:08:15] <coldhead> well said, aqeel
[18:11:08] <aqeel> thanks
[18:13:25] <Blaster> hey I'm doing a $.post and it's set to return JSON.  In my console the returned data object is ["status
[18:13:35] <Blaster> ["status","success"] but I can't access it using data.status
[18:13:44] <Blaster> it says data.status is undefined
[18:13:45] <Blaster> any idea why?
[18:14:45] <coldhead> ?jsonlint @ Blaster
[18:14:46] <bot-t> Blaster, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[18:14:54] <coldhead> make sure your json is actually valid json
[18:14:57] <coldhead> then we can talk
[18:15:16] <coldhead> well, then i can go to lunch
[18:15:22] <coldhead> but someone can talk maybe
[18:16:33] <Blaster> i figured it out
[18:16:34] <Blaster> thanks
[18:18:34] <aqeel> got to go room...c u later....
[18:18:38] <aqeel> bye
[18:19:19] <coldhead> great work, Blaster, take five
[18:19:39] <coldhead> bot-t: tell aqeel i will never forget you and your precious saucer wisdom
[18:19:40] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[18:40:23] <Blaster> hey guys.  any tips on condensing this code?  http://pastebin.com/TpxaZHWG
[18:40:33] <Blaster> New to jQuery and wrote that, but I'm sure it could be condensed
[18:46:33] <arlink> does jquery have a function that can wait until a variable has a value?
[18:48:21] <johnkpaul> arlink: what do you mean wait until a variable has a value?
[18:48:44] <johnkpaul> you can use setInterval to continually check that some global variable has value, but there's probably a better way to accomplsih what you're looking for
[18:49:39] <arlink> johnkpaul, i am crawling site for some prices. undefined is returned when i use each() until the time when it seams the variables have a value
[18:50:15] <johnkpaul> you're using some browser driver like selenium?
[18:50:19] <johnkpaul> are you waiting until after domready?
[18:50:40] <arlink> Im using jsdom, its a headless browser module based on nodejs
[18:51:26] <arlink> johnkpaul, i dont know whether or not the module Im using does domready
[18:52:10] <johnkpaul> so how do you know that the variables have a value in the future?
[18:52:50] <rawfodog> Hey, I'm a programmer but I'm a new to jquery. Where do I start ? I wanna learn this by tonight ;)
[18:53:10] <arlink> i know that they have value in the future because when the script stops i get the prices i want at the end
[18:53:27] <johnkpaul> arlink: can you show me the jquery code that you are using with .each?
[18:53:31] <arlink> but "undefined" is printed in the console before i see prices
[18:53:37] <arlink> ok
[18:54:09] <johnkpaul> rawfodog: google for jquery101 and read those
[18:54:38] <rawfodog> thanks johnkpaul
[18:55:20] <arlink> johnkpaul, http://pastebin.com/60nWWYG9
[18:56:36] <johnkpaul> arlink: why aren't you useing jQueryify?
[18:56:53] <arlink> what is that? :s
[18:56:54] <johnkpaul> it's part of jsdom's api
[18:56:57] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom
[18:57:14] <johnkpaul> I think this is a jsdom issue, not a jquery issue
[19:07:30] <iateadonut> what's the function that searches up the DOM tree?
[19:07:49] <iateadonut> like prevAll() but parents, finds the first parent of a certain type
[19:08:42] <iateadonut> .closest()
[19:17:28] <martisj> is there a way to disable the hover ability of a button once I have clicked it?
[19:18:50] <martisj> $(this).unbind('mouseenter mouseleave') doesn't work
[19:21:47] <martisj> i have set the hover state in the css file. Does this affect the unbind function?
[19:39:08] <aaairc> is there a way to test if a div container within another div is currently visible, given that the outer div does scrolling?
[19:39:11] <aaairc> here is an example
[19:39:12] <aaairc> http://jsbin.com/oyesaf/5/edit#preview
[19:39:16] <aaairc> with a solution that doesn't work
[19:39:36] <aaairc> in my example i want to find out if the inner blue box can currently be seen
[19:42:43] <iateadonut> ah
[19:46:45] <cooldman224> hello i am new to jquery and am trying to filter my list from checkboxes through html5 data-tags. if anyone could point me in the correct way thatd be great. http://jsbin.com/ulerix/edit#source
[20:18:49] <DeLorean719> I have a simple integration with ajax/json and I'm not sure why my data isn't refreshing: http://pastebin.com/rwhM1csV
[20:18:54] <DeLorean719> if I refresh the page, i get new data
[20:18:59] <DeLorean719> otherwise it just keeps repeating the same data
[20:23:35] <joedj> DeLorean719: you are not using ajax. your JSON is baked into the page on the server-side when the page is first rendered, using PHP
[20:24:02] <DeLorean719> well, I really noobed that one didn't I
[20:25:18] <joedj> DeLorean719: =P
[20:25:24] <DeLorean719> IS
[20:25:26] <DeLorean719> oops
[20:25:31] <DeLorean719> is jQuery.getJSON() ajax?
[20:25:41] <joedj> yeah
[20:25:45] <DeLorean719> err I should say
[20:25:50] <DeLorean719> "will it work asynchonously"
[20:26:01] <DeLorean719> since json isn't xml
[20:26:13] <joedj> yep, it will
[20:26:41] <DeLorean719> is there an easy way to modify the code I posted to reflect this?
[20:26:45] <DeLorean719> or will it have to be mostly rewritten
[20:29:43] <joedj> you can mostly reuse it, something like function refreshInfo(){ $.getJSON(url, function(arrayFromPHP) { $.each(arrayFromPHP ... }); }
[20:34:24] <joedj> DeLorean719: (assuming your page is on gpumax.com, otherwise you will have cross-domain problems)
[20:34:25] <DeLorean719> jquery's notation really confuses me
[20:34:40] <DeLorean719> my page is _not_ on gpumax
[20:34:52] <DeLorean719> I have to be simultanously logged in to the site for it to work
[20:35:42] <DeLorean719> http://pastebin.com/ces3wK9d
[20:37:14] <joedj> DeLorean719: in that case, i think you either need to get JSONP from gpumax.com, or proxy the gpumax requests through your own servers or something else that supports JSONP (such as yahoo pipes)
[20:38:19] <DeLorean719> hmm
[20:38:23] <DeLorean719> I don't think I understand the problem
[20:38:37] <DeLorean719> I was pulling the data fine from gpumax cross-domain without problems
[20:38:48] <DeLorean719> well, the data wasn't refreshing... but that's a separate issue
[20:39:11] <DeLorean719> I must be misunderstanding something
[20:39:19] <joedj> you were pulling the data from gpumax using PHP code on your server, the browser was never contacting gpumax
[20:40:13] <DeLorean719> so that's possible when I do it with php since it's a server side language, but it's not possible with jquery since it's client side?
[20:40:14] <joedj> the browser will refuse to contact gpumax, except via JSONP
[20:43:30] <DeLorean719> so if gpumax doesn't provide jsonp... there's no way to get asynchronous data?
[20:45:40] <joedj> DeLorean719: not without either proxying yourself, or using someone else's proxy (as far as i know)
[20:56:04] <DeLorean719> joedj: thanks a lot for your help, it answered a lot of questions (:
[20:58:42] <joedj> DeLorean719: np
[21:01:11] <markun> hey all
[21:04:59] <joedj> DeLorean719: note that I lied a little bit - modern browsers can get cross-domain JSON if the server sends the right Access-Control-Allow-Origin header (it doesn't look like gpumax supports this, though)
[21:06:14] <timeimp> APE or Socket.IO?
[21:09:33] <aaairc> Does anyone know how to test whether a Div is visible to the user. I'm trying to do it in this example.
[21:09:33] <aaairc> http://jsbin.com/oyesaf/7/edit#javascript,html,live
[21:09:59] <markun> little help? I'm trying to add some css classes with .addClass and then find then, detach() and appendTo() somewhere else. The problem when it fires on the 'onload' nothing happens... but if I do call the function manually afterwards it works.
[21:11:45] <Cork> aaairc: visible checks if the element is rendered, not if its actaully seen by the user
[21:12:16] <Cork> that you would have to calculate your self
[21:12:46] <aaairc> so i would have to do a jquery lookup of the bounds of the outer div, and then lookup the position of the inner div and see if it falls within it?
[21:13:02] <aaairc> Cork: ^?
[21:13:19] <DeLorean719> joedj: the owner implemented jsonp for me, but I'm still having trouble lol
[21:13:47] <Cork> aaairc: you could have to calculate its offset, and compare it to its parent scroll position to see if its in view or not
[21:13:55] <Cork> aaairc: visible doens't
[21:14:13] <aqeel> hi room
[21:14:13] <bot-t> (2 hours 54 mins ago) <coldhead> tell aqeel i will never forget you and your precious saucer wisdom
[21:14:27] <coldhead> hi aqeel
[21:14:29] <aaairc> the offset of the inner div?
[21:14:34] <aqeel> hi
[21:14:34] <Cork> aaairc: it checks visibility, display, width and heigt
[21:14:42] <Cork> aaairc: yes
[21:14:52] <Cork> aaairc: scrolled off new doesn't mean its invisible
[21:14:56] <Cork> new==view
[21:15:41] <aaairc> i'll try and do what your saying on the jsbin example i sent out.
[21:16:51] <aqeel> guys jsfiddle taking too long to load?

[21:18:13] <MeowthThatsRight> I'm having issues with jquery sortables. the sortables doesn't seem to want to create itself when the sortable objects is lifte.d
[21:18:26] <aqeel> thanks bot..........i guess put those up there as well ...if one down can simply choose alternative
[21:18:47] <Cork> up there? you mean in the topic?

[21:19:11] <aqeel> here.....where accessibility is provided
[21:19:23] <Cork> its alredy close to max length i think
[21:19:37] <Cork> so theres no space left for that
[21:21:07] <aqeel> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/563186/
[21:21:19] <aqeel> is shorthand correct?
[21:22:00] <Cork> uh... why arn't you generalizing that?
[21:22:40] <monstordh> I need to select any container element which contains a child of type input with the attribute of "disabled". can someone help me with this? i've tried different variations without success
[21:23:07] <MeowthThatsRight> when i follow http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#placeholder it doesn't work i have it connecting too. I'm wondering if it has to do with my css though. you can see the code at http://emos.justdied.com/sb/2.0/
[21:23:47] <MeowthThatsRight> only way to have the sortables connect is by creating a dummy <li> . but the placeholder still doesn't show up
[21:26:47] <Cork> aqeel: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/563187/
[21:27:07] <Cork> aqeel: i'm not sure what submenucontentul is meant to do though
[21:27:42] <aqeel> it is shown by default......'chose from menu'
[21:28:03] <Cork> ah
[21:28:18] <Cork> so as soon as anycontent is shown it should hide?
[21:29:00] <aqeel> yes
[21:29:41] <Cork> then if($('.loaded).length > 0) { $("#submenucontentul").addClass("hidethis"); }
[21:29:44] <Cork> should fix that
[21:32:05] <aqeel> well i guess i need to explain....loaded is added to one of the li and not all and the one it has will show the contents .....
[21:32:34] <Cork> thats what that script does
[21:33:15] <Cork> if finds all elements with the class loaded
[21:33:27] <Cork> goes over them one at a time and takes there id and uses it as a class selector
[21:33:34] <Cork> and hide the selected elements
[21:33:46] <Cork> uh sorry remove the class hidethis
[21:35:45] <aqeel> can u put up reworked one
[21:36:00] <Cork> reworked?
[21:36:03] <aqeel> the 2 seems to be confusing one

[21:37:04] <xp_prg> I have this <form id='nyb_id'> and I try this in the javascript console in chrome: $('#nyb_id'); and it returns null
[21:37:10] <xp_prg> what am I doing wrong?
[21:37:18] <JoeT> Hi folks.  Jquery newbie here, trying like hell to understand it.  Question: .ajaxStart() - I've seen the example that says "$("#loading").ajaxStart(function(){" - do I replace "function()" with my own function name?  It doesn't seem to work.
[21:38:05] <Cork> Joan: function() {} is an inline function, yes you can replace it with a function name if you declared it separatly
[21:38:16] <aqeel> ok putting at work now.....will be back after testing
[21:38:18] <Cork> just remember to NOT include () at the end of the function
[21:39:03] <Cork> function myfunction() { /* actions */ }; $("#loading").ajaxStart(myfunction);
[21:39:17] <JoeT> OK, but what if the function has a value passed to it?
[21:39:35] <Cork> then you need to use an anonymus function as a wrapper
[21:39:48] <Cork> function myfunction() { /* actions */ }; $("#loading").ajaxStart(function() { myfunction(19); });
[21:39:49] <JoeT> OK.  Let me give that a try.
[21:41:06] <Cork> xp_prg: $() should never return null
[21:41:23] <Cork> xp_prg: make sure nothing is overiding jquery
[21:41:24] <xp_prg> it says null on the output line
[21:41:41] <Cork> $.fn.version
[21:41:52] <Cork> sorry
[21:41:59] <Cork> $.fn.jquery
[21:47:04] <infid> is there a way to force .draggable() to stop dragging if a certain condition happens?
[21:47:26] <infid> .draggable('disable') only takes affect after you drop it, but i need it to stop dragging while dragging
[21:48:35] <xp_prg> figured it out, I wasn't executing it in the bottom frame
[21:48:37] <Cork> don't think so
[21:49:12] <Cork> you could try sending it a mouseup event or something, but not sure if that would work
[21:50:07] <infid> how can you send a mouseup event without actually mouseup'ing with your mouse
[21:50:23] <Cork> $()trigger('mouseup')
[21:50:27] <Cork> *$().trigger('mouseup')
[21:50:44] <Cork> its not a "real" event
[21:50:56] <Cork> but it might be real enough to activate jquery-ui
[21:51:50] <infid> interesting
[21:51:56] <infid> that actually does work to a degree

[21:59:16] <Whirl3dOrd3r> when writing a plugin, you have your base function that defines your single nameSpace. $.fn.myPlugin=function (....but can you expose methods by defining them in the myPlugin namespace using $.fn.myPlugin.publicMethod=function () ....
[22:00:08] <Cork> infid: try passing new $.Event('mouseup', { pageX: <cordinat>, pageY: <cordinat> }) as the second argument to trigger
[22:00:30] <infid> k
[22:00:50] <Cork> Whirl3dOrd3r: that would have to be on .prototype
[22:01:21] <Cork> that is $.fn.myPlugin.prototype.publiMethod
[22:02:29] <Whirl3dOrd3r> Cork, thanks for the reply...processing...so inside my base plugin function, I could use this.prototype.publicMethod=function () {....
[22:02:41] <infid> Cork: gives me 'uncaught type error: cannot read property '0' of null
[22:02:41] <Cork> no
[22:02:53] <Cork> infid: bah...
[22:03:41] <monstordh> I need to select any container element which contains a child of type input with the attribute of "disabled". can someone help me with this? i've tried different variations without success
[22:04:27] <Whirl3dOrd3r> $("input:disabled").parent()
[22:04:49] <Whirl3dOrd3r> or $("input:disabled").closest(".containerClassname");

[22:11:46] <kara_sweets> hey guys, im looking to start learning a javascript mvc, do any of you have any recommendations?
[22:14:16] <Cork> infid: try http://jsbin.com/inobuk/2/edit
[22:14:23] <Cork> .trigger({ type: 'mouseup', pageX: 10, pageY: 10 });
[22:15:23] <softmanpetro> hia all
[22:15:59] <softmanpetro> I try to implement fancybox.net with more than 1 videos but it does not show left right arrows for video gallery
[22:16:04] <softmanpetro> any hint ?
[22:16:30] <infid> Cork: still gives me cannot read property '0' of null for some reason
[22:17:08] <Cork> do you get a line number for that?
[22:17:11] <infid> maybe because it's jquery ui's draggable
[22:17:19] <infid> i mean on my system with myh code
[22:17:32] <Cork> no it prob expects something on the event that we'r not setting
[22:18:06] <aqeel> got to go bye room
[22:18:11] <aqeel> c u later
[22:19:39] <coldhead> bot-t: tell aqeel i will never ever forget you and your unforgettable divinity

[22:19:43] * bot-t sighs
[22:20:28] <Whirl3dOrd3r> so I have spent the last three days looking for a decent tutorial about writing a plugin for  animating page content (like a gallery/slideshow). Every tutorial I have found sucks--they rely on really specific situations that don't apply to most users...
[22:21:03] <Whirl3dOrd3r> anybody know of a decent tutorial that explains how to extend jquery via plugin and results in a custom navigation/content system?
[22:23:41] <softmanpetro> how can I see all obkect properties ?
[22:23:48] <softmanpetro> I alert tmp and i get object
[22:23:58] <softmanpetro> but I would like to know what porp it has
[22:24:05] <softmanpetro> properties*
[22:24:07] <Cork> console.log(tmp)
[22:24:52] <softmanpetro> it is obnject cork
[22:24:58] <Cork> if that doesn't work use console.log(Object.keys(tmp))
[22:25:07] <Cork> so replace the variable name -_-
[22:28:01] <softmanpetro> hmm
[22:28:32] <softmanpetro>  $("a[rel=Group1]").click(function() {  $.fancybox({.... and I would like to know which rel was clicked
[22:29:05] <softmanpetro> and in fancybox at case 'swf': console.log(Object.keys(tmp)); I get 0
[22:29:20] <Cork> 0??
[22:29:43] <softmanpetro> anyhow I click on a youtube link and firebuf jump on a different page
[22:29:46] <Cork> ah, its an array
[22:30:10] <softmanpetro> I've checked persist
[22:30:15] <softmanpetro> to see 0
[22:30:24] <Cork> ?eval var t = { key1:'', key2:'', key3:'' }; Object.keys(t)
[22:30:26] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: Object.keys is not a function
[22:30:39] <Cork> oh, lovely the engins too old -_-
[22:31:17] <Cork> softmanpetro: the variable your giveing it is an array
[22:31:18] <softmanpetro> my problem is to find which element I've clicked
[22:31:25] <Cork> obnject[0]
[22:31:33] <Cork> oppsÂ·...
[22:31:54] <softmanpetro> than I will customize titles to show thumbnails and left right for youtube links Cork
[22:32:15] <Cork> softmanpetro: why don't you just use $(this).attr('rel') ?
[22:32:57] <softmanpetro> let me try
[22:33:44] <pjs> hey guys.. I'm sure this is a very basic jquery question.. Can anyone help me out? http://dpaste.com/713949/
[22:37:02] <softmanpetro> that's undefined Cork
[22:37:11] <softmanpetro> console.log($(this).attr('rel') );
[22:37:32] <softmanpetro> inside fancybox code ;(function($) { var....
[22:39:13] <pjs> nvm.. .closest() does the job. thx
[22:47:36] <infid> what exactly does $().blah() do?
[22:47:55] <infid> is it short for $(this).blah()?
[22:48:23] <Cork> $() shouldn't work
[22:49:05] <Cork> softmanpetro: where are you checking for the rel?
[22:52:08] <gst123> i have a big doubt regarding i have 5 html pages in that first page having 4 check box and one next button......if am selected 1st and 3rd check box and then click continue.....here i want to get the first html page and 2nd html page should be skip and third page would be display and fourth page should not display....its possible in jquery

[22:53:26] <gst123> am new for jquery pls any1 help me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[22:53:42] <softmanpetro> added as a option for $fancybos
[22:54:18] <softmanpetro> will var numItems = $('rel="'+currentOpts.selector+'"').length count all the <a  rel="Group69"... items ?
[22:54:22] <softmanpetro> cork
[22:55:02] <Cork> no
[22:55:09] <softmanpetro> var numItems = $('a[rel="'+currentOpts.selector+'"]').length; than ?
[22:55:12] <Cork>  $('a[rel="'+currentOpts.selector+'"]')
[22:55:15] <Cork> ya
[22:55:16] <softmanpetro> ok
[22:55:18] <dreen> HITHEREALL
[22:56:01] <softmanpetro> thx cork for talking ;)
[22:56:07] <softmanpetro> I am back on the road
[22:56:11] <Cork> heh np
[23:10:51] <aaairc> would anyone know why in this test of visibility of divs within a scrolling divs, the pixel heights/offset seem to be slightly off? for example, if you scroll down to the blue box, if just the top of it is showing, the math instead tells you its not visible
[23:10:52] <aaairc> http://jsbin.com/oyesaf/10/edit#preview
[23:11:06] <aaairc> Cork: here is the example, based on your guidance ^
[23:11:34] <aaairc> like i just mentioned, the pixel heights seem to be a little fuzzy, which i don't quite understand why
[23:14:08] <FinalAngel> is there a method to el.load(); to figure out if it actually loads or not?
[23:16:13] <Cork> aaairc: you want to check scrollTop http://jsbin.com/oyesaf/11/edit
[23:16:15] <aaairc> got it to work
[23:16:16] <aaairc> http://jsbin.com/oyesaf/12/edit
[23:17:10] <aaairc> it was that i was using offset vs position
[23:17:17] <aaairc> so offset was doing it relative to the window
[23:17:20] <aaairc> vs the containing div
[23:25:26] <Whirl3dOrd3r> jsfiddle is down?
[23:25:53] <softmanpetro> I am using bind with click for firing a fancyboix and I customise the title of the fancy to display links to the rest of the gallery items
[23:26:11] <softmanpetro> the problem is that the new customised title links are not binded to same click
[23:26:17] <softmanpetro> any ideea where I do wrong ?
[23:28:27] <Cork> bind only works if the element exists when you run the bind command
[23:28:42] <softmanpetro> what can I do Cork then ?
[23:28:57] <Cork> use delegate
[23:29:00] <Cork> ?.on
[23:29:01] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:29:01] <softmanpetro> live ()?
[23:29:06] <Cork> (check the delegate part)
[23:29:34] <Cork> softmanpetro: you prob want to still bind it to the dialog so it doesn't affect the entire page
[23:35:09] <raj> what is $.widget( ?
[23:35:23] <Cork> widgetfactor
[23:35:27] <Cork> its part of jquery ui
[23:35:40] <Cork> *widgetfactory
[23:36:31] <raj> Cork, I have code that has that line for jquery-file-upload, but https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin doesn't say anything about that
[23:36:51] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/8V79hKZgzGSjbjRbZgwgza
[23:37:12] <raj> not sure if I have that there because of legacy, or whether it's actually doing something
[23:37:17] <Cork> yup is uses jquery ui
[23:37:26] <raj> but the basic setup says nothing about that
[23:38:07] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/mKqqyqqECvx6SpJNMrpXAa
[23:38:09] <softmanpetro> should items[i].attr["id"] work for var items = $('a[rel="group"]'); ? cork
[23:38:21] <raj> I have what the example shows, but I also have that $.widget stuff
[23:38:44] <Cork> no
[23:38:52] <Cork> ?.eq @ softmanpetro
[23:38:53] <bot-t> softmanpetro, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[23:41:37] <softmanpetro> items.eq(i).attr["id"] is undefined ! Do I'm still wrong ?
[23:46:28] <softmanpetro> items.eq(i).attr["id"] is undefined cork ! Do I'm still wrong ?
[23:49:19] <Cork> softmanpetro: attr('id')
[23:49:32] <softmanpetro> thx
[23:50:09] <raj> so Cork, that's a widget definition?
[23:51:06] <Cork> raj: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[23:54:25] <raj> Cork, thanks
[23:55:01] <raj> I'm trying to clean up/organize this code I wrote months ago
[23:55:22] <raj> have you worked with jquery-file-upload before Cork?
[23:55:24] <dreen> Cork, you are so very helpful, may I ask why? I mean do you have a specific mandate to be helpful or is it something you enjoy?
[23:55:29] <Cork> no
[23:56:02] <raj> yeah, he really is
[23:56:12] <Cork> dreen: no mandate, just cause it gives me posiblitilies to learn more
[23:56:37] <dreen> that is an awesome outlook!
[23:56:50] <Trisox> thank god its friday	 !!!
[23:56:58] <Cork> lol
[23:58:14] <AdvoWork> Hi there, im doing: $.ajax(url, function(data) {console.log(data); $('#column').replaceWith(data); });  where url is: var url = "http://"+IPADDRESS + ":"+INTRANET_PORT+"/index.php?section=Purchasing&action=raise_po";  yet when it runs, it shows the response of the page in firebug, but it doesn't show anything on the page, ie it doesn't appear to show that content in my column div. Any ideas please?
[23:58:56] <Cork> AdvoWork: is ipaddress:port the same location your site is on?
[23:59:56] <raj> Cork, I don't see a single mention of doing $.widget('blueimp.fileupload', $.blueimp.fileupload, ...) in the docs https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API
