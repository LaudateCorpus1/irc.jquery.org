[06:50:03] <IHasFingers> hi guys, i have a form which get generate using javascript and jquery into a modal e.g. using the append method. The issue is when the form is submitted i want to prevent it from reloading the page. I have tried everything e.g. $("form").submit(function(e){ alert('submit intercepted'); e.preventDefault(e); });
[09:33:34] <IHasFingers> hi how to make the new changes reflect on the form https://jsfiddle.net/fvu83pjd/5/
[11:56:13] <Flyste> Am I still here?
[11:57:02] <Hopplahase> You just arrived, it seems :p
[12:10:42] <mossengine> I am looking to validate a finding as a potential bug or just me not understanding something in jQuerUI draggable, is this the best place and is anyone available to discuss?
[12:23:28] <mossengine> When on this page https://jqueryui.com/draggable/ and inspecting the #draggable element for event listeners, you will see there are three ( what appears to be identical ) remove events. This seems wrong but what adds to this is that when you interact with the draggable element ( move it around and drop it ) and then inspect the event listeners again, there are now five ( added two ) of all appearing to be the same remove event in the jqu
[12:23:29] <mossengine> ery-ui.js file on line 595. Repeat the move and drop and it keeps adding two more each time Is this possibly a bug? I feel it might likely either just add junk continually and might even cause lockups if it ever needs to execute and evaluate the remove events. Any thoughts?
[13:32:52] <shoky> mossengine: you seem to be right
[13:43:02] <shoky> mossengine: seems it was fixed, but never released  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1769
[13:44:29] <shoky> latest jqui version was released 2 months before that fix
[15:50:21] <codecutter> how do i remove exif data from images?
[15:54:49] <robertmaxrees> i mean, a search in google reveals some options
[15:55:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure what that has to do with jquery tho.
[16:20:14] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: whats going on in line 10? what is 'this.result' referring to? https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/ufbp2cyt/1/
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> lol can just ask the room duder ;)
[16:20:46] <robertmaxrees> also: ##javascript is where you want to be :)
[16:21:42] <codecutter> ah
[16:21:45] <codecutter> my bad
[16:21:48] <codecutter> duder
[16:43:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:49:08] <Hopplahase> The rate of off-topic questions in this channel really seems unusually high :p
[16:49:32] <robertmaxrees> I think people just don't know where else to go.
[16:51:16] <Hopplahase> Perhaps, but how do they find this channel then? The topic doesn't even mention JavaScript, but pure JS questions are quite common here
[16:52:42] <robertmaxrees> A lot of people start here and default to asking here.
[16:52:59] <robertmaxrees> usually because people start their frontend dev careers by using jquery.
[16:53:37] <robertmaxrees> And then they aren't sure what is and isn't relevant.  or they think that just because a channel doesn't exist/doesn't have anybody responding that we need to magically come up with answers.
[17:03:16] <Hopplahase> What is even more annoying IMHO is when they cross-post the same question in several channels and keep two or more channels busy without giving repsonse when they found an answer in another channel
[18:00:15] <robertmaxrees> haha yep.  i've kicked people for doing that in the past./
[18:11:56] <Hopplahase> Nice :D
[23:23:35] <mossengine> shoky: thanks for confirming and also finding that PR for the fix. based on your comments and what I can see in master it seems the fix is not yet part of a release. Good to know it was found and resolved, I will keep an eye out for next update ( hopefully that includes ) but I can now comfortably continue to develop my feature knowing the issue should not become an unknown gremlin later :) thanks again.
