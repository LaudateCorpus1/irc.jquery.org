[04:22:33] <EugenA> why I get error this.test is not a function ?
[04:26:38] <Cork> EugenA: multille reasons
[04:26:51] <Cork> you never define test on "this"
[04:26:59] <Cork> $(function() {}) creates a new this
[04:28:03] <Cork> s/multille/multiple/
[04:28:29] <EugenA> i see.. how to fix it?
[04:30:05] <Cork> EugenA: save the object in a variable and use the variable to access the function
[04:30:35] <Cork> var result = {}; $(function() { result.test() }); return result;
[04:44:03] <EugenA> Cork: I don't understand, how should I change my current return ?
[04:51:27] <Uhkis> learning javascript basics would probably be the next step before continuing
[04:57:23] <EugenA> Uhkis: what exactly should I know to understand the problem?
[04:57:57] <pavonia> I don't understand that solution either, tbh
[05:00:57] <pavonia> That first one should be `result = { test: ... }', I guess
[05:02:34] <EugenA> pavonia: that makes sense, I'll try that
[05:02:38] <Uhkis> EugenA: objects, scope and such
[05:03:17] <EugenA> ok, now it is fine
[05:43:40] <solsTiCe> hi. I define a click event on ul li a. But alter on, I mepty the ul to repopulate it with other li a. How can I get my previous event defined to work ?
[05:46:02] <pavonia> Use delegated events: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[05:50:10] <solsTiCe> pavonia: yes. thanks. I search google with jquery rebind event to new dom and found that jquery rebind event to new dom. BUt now I know it's called delegated events ;-)
[05:50:41] <solsTiCe> ooops found that https://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements
[05:50:45] <solsTiCe> never mind
[06:28:10] <naqued> i got a json with some parameter and one id. When in jquery i try $(".myclass").val(data.id); i got in the html <input type=hidden value="[object object]"> when i print in the console the json and the id with an alert(data.id); i got the right int value ..
[06:28:14] <naqued> hi everyone :)
[06:40:03] <AdamPDotty> alert() has an implicit toString(). Did yo try console.log() ?
[07:06:58] <naqued> AdamPDotty : yes with console.log() i got the same a good int
[07:10:32] <AdamPDotty> Would probably helpful to see a live example.
[07:37:34] <ciaone> Hi guys, anyone could help me with MMENU?
[11:09:56] <sine0> hello you fantastic people
[11:11:00] <sine0> I am removing active class and adding active class to select a certain tab when the page loads, however the tab is selected but the first data is still on there, its almost as if it needs another action to do teh 'click'
[11:17:01] <sine0> .trigger("click") does not cuteth thyme mustarde
[11:25:33] <sine0> one at a time folks, I dont have a scrollback
[13:06:32] <Es0teric> i have a question -- https://kopy.io/Ybg0D so this code has something that toggles a dropdown but .dropdown-button is supposed to be inside of .dropdown-container in order for the dropdown to trigger... how do i make it so that when i click .dropdown-button outside of the container that it still triggers the dropdown as expected?
[13:11:14] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to find some other way to relate the button back to its dropdown
[13:11:35] <robertmaxrees> could do it via an ID or a Class or w/e
[13:11:46] <robertmaxrees> or refactor your markup
[13:15:04] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees well i am using bourbon refills
[13:15:12] <Es0teric> so its a component
[13:15:39] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees but what do you mean by "relate the button back to its dropdown"?
[13:16:18] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to give the dropdown an ID or something and then stick a data element on the button that points to that ID./
[13:16:30] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees and then what?
[13:17:40] <robertmaxrees> and then change your JS to use that data attribute instead of doing it contextually like you are now.
[13:20:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees can you show me an example of what you mean through the code i just posted?
[13:21:40] <robertmaxrees> sure - what about that doesn't make sense?
[13:22:41] <Es0teric> ok so i dont understand the whole changing the js to use the data attribute
[13:23:04] <Es0teric> i haven't used js like this in awhile so im kinda rusty
[13:23:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/6p3f5nzy/
[13:23:46] <robertmaxrees> that's the basic idea.
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[13:24:12] <robertmaxrees> are they still in the same component?
[13:41:20] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah
[13:41:26] <robertmaxrees> oh
[13:41:38] <robertmaxrees> could you share the markup of the two versions you're working with then?
[13:41:44] <robertmaxrees> 'cause there's a much easier way to do this.
[13:42:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees what do you mean? im just using this: http://refills.bourbon.io/components/
[13:42:17] <Es0teric> the dropdown
[13:42:30] <Es0teric> the last code i pasted is the only version i have
[13:43:01] <robertmaxrees> "how do i make it so that when i click .dropdown-button outside of the container that it still triggers the dropdown as expected?"
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> that's confusing then.
[13:43:17] <robertmaxrees> because it makes it sound like there's an additional button somewhere.
[13:43:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees well .dropdown-button has to be inside of the .dropdown-container
[13:43:26] <robertmaxrees> trying to figure out how it relates back to the dropdown.
[13:43:47] <Es0teric> but the way i have the menu setup, i need it outside of the .dropdown-container
[13:43:58] <Es0teric> because its a burger icon
[13:44:03] <robertmaxrees> right, so can you show me what that looks like?
[13:44:26] <Es0teric> sure, sec
[13:46:42] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://anonfile.com/8ehdlee1b8/Screen_Shot_2018-04-27_at_1.44.12_PM.png
[13:46:54] <Es0teric> the far right is what i am trying to get to click
[13:47:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:47:07] <robertmaxrees> so can you share the actual HTML?
[13:47:15] <Es0teric> i did
[13:47:25] <Es0teric> the kopy.io link is the actual html
[13:47:55] <Es0teric> for that side
[13:48:00] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[13:48:02] <robertmaxrees> derp derp.
[13:48:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:48:12] <robertmaxrees> so it still shares that one LI?
[13:48:18] <robertmaxrees> are there any other dropdowns in that li?
[13:48:18] <Es0teric> yeah
[13:48:22] <Es0teric> no
[13:48:41] <Es0teric> just look at the link again https://kopy.io/Ybg0D
[13:48:46] <robertmaxrees> already looking.
[13:48:48] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:49:11] <Es0teric> ok
[13:49:29] <robertmaxrees> okay so the easiest way to do this is to give that li some kind of sensible class like <li class="dropodown-menu-and-button">
[13:49:50] <Es0teric> ok
[13:50:00] <robertmaxrees> then to find $menu, you just $button.closest('.dropodown-menu-and-button').find('.dropdown-menu')
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd pull that $menu.children("li").click(function() { out of the click handler for dropdown-button.
[13:50:46] <Es0teric> why/
[13:51:22] <robertmaxrees> the way you have it now is re-binding that handler every time you click on the menu.
[13:51:34] <robertmaxrees> which means it fires multiple times if the user opens the menu.
[13:51:39] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want.
[13:51:47] <Es0teric> right so what would be a better alternative?
[13:52:10] <robertmaxrees> do it outside of the click handler for the menu button.
[13:53:00] <Es0teric> menu is not opening yet
[13:53:22] <Es0teric> oh wait
[13:53:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:53:47] <Es0teric> i have gulp and it wasnt running
[13:53:49] <Es0teric> i have to compile app.js
[13:53:51] <Es0teric> oh damn it worked
[13:53:53] <Es0teric> dopeeee
[13:53:56] <Es0teric> but the problem is this now
[13:54:41] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://anonfile.com/R2hcl7e4b2/Screen_Shot_2018-04-27_at_1.53.57_PM.png
[13:54:44] <Es0teric> thats the problem now
[13:55:09] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:55:35] <robertmaxrees> sorry, since I don't have the markup in front of me, or what you're expecting, it's hard to know what exactly the issue it.
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> s/issue it/issue is
[14:01:17] <Es0teric> well the dropdown is out of place
[14:01:18] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[14:01:34] <robertmaxrees> so it's a syiling issue?
[14:01:37] <robertmaxrees> *styling
[14:02:41] <Es0teric> idk
[14:03:17] <Es0teric> i have the correct styling that was required for it
[14:03:20] <robertmaxrees> when you say "out of place", what do you mean?
[14:04:10] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ah i see nvm
[14:12:14] <Es0teric> thanks robertmaxrees at this point i can figure out the css
[14:17:41] <robertmaxrees> awesome :)
[14:17:44] <robertmaxrees> glad I could help!
[14:24:40] <jalvarez> hello
[14:24:46] <jalvarez> quick question
[14:24:56] <jalvarez> if i have an iframe
[14:25:10] <jalvarez> and i want to click the iframe and have an alert popup?
[14:25:14] <jalvarez> how can i do that
[14:25:27] <jalvarez> the iframe takes up the whole visible screen
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> jalvarez that depends.
[14:28:24] <robertmaxrees> is the iframe source the same port, protocol, and domain as the page you're on?
[14:28:39] <robertmaxrees> or do you mean the entirety of the iframe, regardless of where in it they clicked?

[16:49:08] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:50:03] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] share your code.
[16:50:16] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle or something else.
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> like bpaste
[16:53:12] <zrtech[m]> one sec
[16:54:26] <zrtech[m]> http://test.zrtechnologies.com/themes/foundry/js/scripts.js?v=8
[16:54:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> which line?
[16:54:53] <zrtech[m]> mobile menu toggle issue when user logs in. Use login: help and pass: help to see the mobile menu toggle bug I am experiencing...
[16:55:09] <robertmaxrees> too much code for me to read through it all.
[16:55:26] <zrtech[m]> oh right, scroll to //Mobile Menu
[16:55:45] <robertmaxrees> which toggleCLass?
[16:56:07] * zrtech[m] sent a long message: zrtech[m]_2018-04-27_20:56:06.txt <https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/WkjPPeoqVSQAmmysWavIYAQZ>
[16:56:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:56:17] <zrtech[m]> those fail when you login
[16:56:30] <robertmaxrees> "when you login"??
[16:56:55] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle or something?
[16:56:58] <zrtech[m]> it throws the jquery error I posted earlier in Chrome Developer Tools Console
[16:57:08] <robertmaxrees> the "login" part is where I'
[16:57:12] <robertmaxrees> *i'm getting lost
[16:57:20] <robertmaxrees> like, which of those two toggleClass calls is failing?
[16:59:07] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] here's why I'm asking for a test case: https://jsfiddle.net/ev8dbggy/
[16:59:27] <robertmaxrees> with the limited information you're giving, it should work fine. a more complete picture would be helpful.
[17:00:50] <zrtech[m]> go to http://test.zrtechnologies.com and minimize the window to mobile size, then click the navigation menu and you'll notice normal functionality. then if you go to http://test.zrtechnologies.com/user/login and login using login: help, password: help, you'll notice the navigation menu fails. When inspected in Chrome Developer Tools, it throws a Jquery error:  Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #. I
[17:00:51] <zrtech[m]> believe that jquery error is preventing the // Mobile Menu .toggleClass in "scripts.js" from adding the class .nav-open to the navigation menu. I am not sure how to debug or resolve this on my own, tried everything...
[17:07:44] <zrtech[m]> I am sorry for being difficult robertmaxrees but my issue is a little more complicated than just pasting some code...my above description is the best way to get on the same page as me...sorry for any inconvenience >_<
[17:12:01] <robertmaxrees> you've got a bunch of js errors to take care of.
[17:12:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not specific to your toggleclass it looks like.
[17:13:08] <robertmaxrees> i would fix those first.
[17:13:34] <zrtech[m]> I just want my mobile menu to toggle :-(
[17:13:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:14:00] <robertmaxrees> you realize your masonry file is broken, right?>
[17:14:35] <robertmaxrees> and you can get it to work if you fix your other issues.
[17:14:46] <robertmaxrees> the problem is the js fails, so nothing really works.
[17:16:37] <zrtech[m]> if I knew how to fix them, I would have already, I'm overwhelmed by the errors and not sure where to even begin. I believe my biggest fault is lacking the knowledge on how to debug these issues. I want to fix everything, but not sure where to start.
[17:17:11] <robertmaxrees> start with fixing your masonry file.
[17:17:32] <zrtech[m]> looking into that now actually
[17:17:45] <robertmaxrees> re-copy/paste it or whatever you did originally.
[17:18:00] <zrtech[m]> thank you for even looking at my issue, I really appreciate your time and input ^_^
[17:18:13] <robertmaxrees> also: that error you think is for your mobile menu isn't - it happens whenever you click anywhere on the page.
[17:18:49] <zrtech[m]> oh well i feel stupid for noticing it happens when you click anywhere lol
[17:19:09] <zrtech[m]> *not
[17:22:39] <robertmaxrees> your About Us markup is broken, too.
[17:22:46] <robertmaxrees> data-target="#"
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid target.
[17:23:12] <cannap> yo today i  started using jquery :P
[17:23:14] <robertmaxrees> so bootstrap thinks it's getting a valid selector, but jquery doesn't even know how ot work with that.
[17:23:18] <cannap> its very hard
[17:23:21] <cannap> after vue :P
[17:23:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:24:03] <cannap> yea sry fro cross posting :P
[17:24:06] <cannap> for*
[17:24:39] <robertmaxrees> zrtech[m] also: that page advertises that you "perform a top-to-bottom assessment of your issues to determine permanent solutions."
[17:24:43] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:40:05] <zrtech[m]> yeah but it doesn't say that anyone's perfect and that I myself knows every top-to-bottom option lol robertmaxrees
[17:47:07] <robertmaxrees> just enjoying the irony.
[17:48:07] <zrtech[m]> oh shuttup lmao
[17:48:40] <zrtech[m]> luckily I indulge in smart asses lolol
[19:05:15] <techdude> quick question on jquery mobile for anyone
[19:05:36] <techdude> Is the project pretty much abandoned at this point, or is the continued development?
[19:06:24] <techdude> It's getting difficult to support since it is still stuck on the old jquery versions, and the 3.0 migrate stuff doesn't work for all parts
[19:06:36] <robertmaxrees> http://blog.jquerymobile.com/
[19:06:56] <robertmaxrees> ^This should give you some insight
[19:07:37] <robertmaxrees> and also: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile
[19:07:51] <techdude> Yeah, not much there but demo updates
[19:08:02] <techdude> Nothing core in about 2 yrs
[19:09:33] <techdude> Ok, thanks for the help
[22:38:24] <theology> anyone hiring?
