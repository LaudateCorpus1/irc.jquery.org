[01:23:53] <cyberbrai> hi there
[01:23:59] <cyberbrai> https://jsfiddle.net/LQB4B/719/
[01:24:07] <cyberbrai> here is my fiddle how can i get the diff b/w two time
[01:29:51] <systemfault> I would try a substraction, what do you think?
[01:32:42] <cyberbrai> no idea
[01:32:47] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/LQB4B/721/
[01:32:54] <Cork> should be fairly obvious
[01:34:09] <systemfault> Believe it or not... the result of a substraction is called: difference
[01:34:27] <cyberbrai> Cork bit it's not right
[01:34:46] <systemfault> How is it "not right".
[01:34:48] <Cork> cyberbrai: uh... well then the values isn't right
[01:35:04] <cyberbrai> want difference between two dates like 2 second or 5 sec
[01:35:06] <Cork> the end time minus the start time is the difference
[01:35:07] <cyberbrai> date is right
[01:35:43] <cyberbrai> after a bit search found something intersting
[01:35:45] <cyberbrai> http://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/javascript/calculating-the-difference-between-two-dates-in-javascript.html#fbid=5myOtb1cSIz
[01:35:51] <systemfault> cyberbrai: If a timestamp is in millisecond...
[01:36:06] <systemfault> How do you transform that in seconds?
[01:36:11] <Cork> ...
[01:36:23] <cyberbrai> no it's var r= new Date().getTime();
[01:36:32] <Cork> >_<''
[01:36:34] <systemfault> Someone never got to high school here...
[01:36:38] <Cork> are you serious or trolling??
[01:36:38] <systemfault> Sad.
[01:36:46] <cyberbrai> i am not trolling
[01:36:55] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime
[01:37:04] <Cork> "The value returned by the getTime() method is the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC."
[01:37:31] <cyberbrai> oooh ok
[01:37:34] <systemfault> Date.now() was created so you don't have to create a useless Date object to get the current timestamp.
[01:37:46] <Cork> ya
[01:38:00] <cyberbrai> i thought it's just give me the millisec.
[01:38:15] <cyberbrai> ok  thanks Cork and systemFault
[01:38:37] <Cork> cyberbrai: just check in the documentation if something isn't looking like you expect
[01:38:46] <Cork> it is usually a quick answer...
[01:39:24] <cyberbrai> actually i have to calculate the logging time of user and nothing
[01:39:36] <cyberbrai> like user login for 5 minutes or less
[01:39:57] <Cork> you might want to check moment.js
[01:40:24] <cyberbrai> yes you are right but i want to handle in js
[01:40:45] <Cork> well it is fairly simple
[01:40:54] <Cork> just take the original time, convert it to a date object
[01:41:11] <Cork> use setMinutes and getMinutes to take the original minute and add 5
[01:41:25] <Cork> then check if the resulting date object is bigger then Date.now()
[01:41:26] <Cork> done
[01:42:06] <cyberbrai> let me try
[01:42:19] <cyberbrai> thanks for respons
[01:56:55] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/JS69L/1104/

[09:16:12] <filadome> anyone know where i can get a nice file menu that's similar to a Windows menu
[09:18:07] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:18:23] <jomofcw> Do you know any uptodate/customizable version of this : https://github.com/CD1212/jQuery-Font-Chooser ?
[09:19:04] <lilalinuxKL> Hi all
[09:19:35] <Cork> filadome: you mean a menu bar for the webpage?
[09:19:40] <filadome> right
[09:20:39] <Cork> i think jquery ui has one (or at least they had in there lab=
[09:20:41] <Cork> *)
[09:21:06] <lilalinuxKL> I'm setting some css() and text(), but sometimes due to a heavy load after these calls, the effect of them isn't shown
[09:21:17] <Cork> filadome: though ex. http://css3menu.com/volume-light-red.html
[09:21:20] <lilalinuxKL> how can I force to wait until the css() and text() is being shown
[09:21:37] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: you can't
[09:21:53] <Cork> rendering is done when js isn't running
[09:22:05] <Cork> so only way to make sure it gets to run is to not run heavy code
[09:22:35] <Cork> filadome: anyway search for css drop down menu you should find a bunch
[09:22:36] <lilalinuxKL> O_o
[09:23:01] <lilalinuxKL> I'm trying to display a progress bar
[09:23:02] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: an option is to do something like setTimeout(function() { /* rest of the code */ });
[09:23:05] <lilalinuxKL> because of the heavy load :-)
[09:23:24] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: you have to either move the heavy code into a webworker thread
[09:23:29] <Cork> or split it up with a timer
[09:23:34] <lilalinuxKL> k, thx
[09:23:39] <Cork> cause the browser has to get time to run
[09:23:44] <Cork> else it can't update the page
[09:24:04] <Cork> (webpages are single threaded by default, so if you do something the browser can't)
[09:24:44] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: a fairly common option is to split the job up into smaller batches
[09:25:05] <Cork> and loop around those batches with a setTimeout(nextStepFunctionName)
[09:25:24] <Cork> (note that you shouldn't use a time, just give the browser a tick to do what it needs)
[09:25:43] <lilalinuxKL> I'll try that, thank you
[09:26:56] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: but i also recommend checking if the browser support webworker and use that if possible
[09:27:16] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: cause the setTimeout WILL cause the work to take a significantly longer time
[09:27:53] <taplar> throw up a progress bar gif, :D
[09:28:04] <Cork> taplar: that won't update either
[09:28:14] <taplar> *before the work starts
[09:28:21] <Cork> the page isn't redrawn while js works
[09:28:31] <taplar> huh
[09:28:32] <Cork> so ya you will have a progress bar but it won't change
[09:33:31] <lilalinuxKL> :-)
[09:34:55] <Cork> it is basically the same logic as the main thread on android/ios apps
[09:35:00] <Cork> you shouldn't do heavy work there
[09:35:46] <filadome> does the jquery ui api have something to animate the menu when it opens and closes?
[09:36:21] <Cork> ya
[09:36:38] <Cork> it has a fairly big effects library
[09:36:58] <filadome> Cork: i mean this menu: http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/
[09:36:59] <Cork> https://jqueryui.com/effect/
[09:37:12] <Cork> filadome: i know
[09:39:11] <filadome> is it something that needs to be written or does it exist as an option?
[09:39:42] <Cork> haven't used menu enough to tell, but you might have to override the showing/hiding of the menus to use the effects
[09:41:23] <Cork> if i create menus i normally create them with pure css
[09:41:32] <Cork> and then add a tiny bit of js for better experience
[09:50:27] <lilalinuxKL> using timeouts will add more "this" confusion :-(
[09:57:16] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: well not confusion
[09:57:42] <Cork> but ya, it will strip the this reference unless you pass it along (something older ie doesn't support)
[09:58:48] <lilalinuxKL> Cork: thank you, it's working now
[09:59:15] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: have a read at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers
[09:59:17] <Cork> when you have time
[09:59:47] <Cork> the big hurdle with webworkers is that you don't have dom access
[09:59:59] <Cork> so you have to think about that when you implement them
[10:00:40] <lilalinuxKL> can I use jquery in the worker, then?
[10:10:26] <taplar> i'd think so, however iirc webworkers don't have access to the DOM so you'd be restricted to jquery methods that do not perform lookups
[10:10:39] <decx> which is the whole point of jquery
[10:11:53] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: no you can't use jquery in a worker cause the worker doesn't have document
[10:11:58] <Cork> something that jquery depends on
[10:18:27] <lilalinuxKL> Cork: setTimeout(Function.prototype, 1); did the trick without breaking down code
[10:18:47] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: like i said don't give it a time
[10:18:56] <Cork> setTimeout(Function.prototype);
[10:19:09] <lilalinuxKL> ah, I thought you mean a low time :-)
[10:19:25] <Cork> no you don't really want a delay, you just want to give the browser a tick
[10:19:41] <Cork> (though the two values are the same so...)
[10:19:59] <Cork> undefined or > 9 == 9 so...
[10:20:22] <Cork> but it is a clearer statement then a fake number
[10:20:37] <Cork> (so in the future the browser can theoretically optimize for it)
[11:25:50] <thebope> If I attached a listener to the scroll event, could I name it so I could remove it but not a different scroll event with .off()?
[11:26:52] <taplar> should be able to
[11:27:28] <NoiseEee> just beware of scroll events, you will likely want/need a debouncer/throttle script
[11:28:07] <thebope> NoiseEee: thanks I've got that covered luckily, they do fire pretty rapidly
[11:29:33] <thebope> ahh thanks taplar yea you're right
[11:41:40] <PCatinean> config_form.on('change', '.cfg_input', function(){ how do I add another event to trigger the same function?
[11:45:31] <AwkwardCough> should be ...on('change keyup keypress etc' function(e){...
[11:45:52] <PCatinean> hmm just realised it's on change for one and on blur for another
[11:46:33] <Cryptite> Hey folks, can anybody look at this and tell me how to correctly bind the key events to the elements in my list?
[11:46:33] <Cryptite> http://hastebin.com/cotuyalupu.coffee
[11:46:48] <Cryptite> Getting "Uncaught TypeError: item.on is not a function"
[11:49:38] <taplar> on is a jquery method
[11:49:53] <taplar> you can't do it directly on the DOM Element, you have to wrap it
[11:54:33] <Cryptite> taplar, how best to wrap it? I'm pretty new to jQuery
[11:54:46] <taplar> $( yourElement )
[11:59:20] <PCatinean> config_form.on('blur', '.custom_val', onchange()) shouldn't this activate when a element from config_form with class custom_val is de-focused/blurred ?
[11:59:42] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:59:48] <robertmaxrees> drop the () from onchange
[12:00:09] <robertmaxrees> when you do that within a callback, you're running the function immediately and assigning the return to the handler.
[12:02:22] <Cryptite> thanks taplar
[12:03:08] <PCatinean> ahh, ok robertmaxrees thanks but the one above which has change as an event works :0s
[12:03:39] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, still nothing :(
[12:08:41] <robertmaxrees> sorry, back.
[12:09:21] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean fiddle?
[12:09:40] <robertmaxrees> also, does config_form exist when you run your binding?
[12:09:59] <PCatinean> I doubt I can make one work to be honest, the example is complex :(
[12:10:15] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, just above that line I have config_form.on('change', '.cfg_input', onchange); which works perfectly
[12:10:32] <PCatinean> mm wait
[12:12:32] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet that second arg is suspect then.
[12:17:17] <PCatinean> hmm, sounds like I messed something up
[12:17:25] <PCatinean> Changes do not reflect in behavior of the page
[12:17:38] <robertmaxrees> maybe things are caching too aggressively.
[12:18:34] <PCatinean> OOR OOR, just thinking outside the box here, even deeper more complex issues
[12:18:43] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:18:46] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't start there.
[12:19:00] <PCatinean> like that fact that you are talking to an idiot that has been making changes in a copy of project stored somewhere else
[12:19:04] * PCatinean gives a thumbs up
[12:19:08] <PCatinean> \0/
[12:19:09] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:19:11] <robertmaxrees> it's all good mang.
[12:19:22] <PCatinean> #facepalmtime XD
[12:20:13] <PCatinean> Now I know it's the right place because it's not working on either sides
[12:20:53] <PCatinean> In JS is it mandatory to define the method before calling it?
[12:21:04] <robertmaxrees> method or function?
[12:21:11] <PCatinean> uhm, function
[12:21:44] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you define it.
[12:22:13] <PCatinean> quick test
[12:22:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x1ytL2L7/
[12:22:34] <PCatinean> work either way
[12:22:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:22:43] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddle.  open your console.
[12:22:51] <robertmaxrees> bar errors.  foo doesn't.
[12:24:21] <PCatinean> ah because you store the function inside a var?
[12:24:31] <robertmaxrees> they're both stored in vars.
[12:25:00] <robertmaxrees> the difference has to do with how the engine interprets those two commands.  function foo() {} has its declaration hoisted to the top of the current scope.
[12:25:19] <robertmaxrees> var foo = function() {}; doesn't.
[12:25:32] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer var foo = function() {}; myself.
[12:45:42] <PCatinean_> back
[12:45:50] <PCatinean_> thanks for the pointers robertmaxrees
[12:45:54] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[12:46:10] <PCatinean_> XD
[13:02:53] <mdiamond> I was curious about a sentence in the 3.0 Upgrade Guide: “If you are currently using .then(), you may only receive a single argument in your handler.”
[13:03:11] <mdiamond> what does “may” mean here? it looks like jQuery 3.1 still supports multiple arguments in .then callbacks
[13:03:29] <mdiamond> is this something that may be unsupported in some future version?
[13:03:43] <robertmaxrees> link?
[13:04:06] <mdiamond> robertmaxrees: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#callback-invocation
[13:05:00] <mdiamond> I tested it out with $.when(‘foo’, ‘bar’, ‘baz’).then(function(){ console.log(arguments); });
[13:05:05] <mdiamond> and I got all 3 in the handler
[13:06:18] <robertmaxrees> let's look at the site's repo for the verbiage change.
[13:06:24] <robertmaxrees> see if the pr talks about the language.
[13:08:01] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  not seeing it.  i'd have to ask in #jquery-dev.
[13:08:40] <mdiamond> that’s okay… it’s not a huge deal, I was just a bit confused as to how much jQuery was enforcing restrictions on # of arguments
[13:08:49] <robertmaxrees> here's what that's supposed to mean iirc - .then() callbacks aren't supposed to have a bunch of extra data passed to the handler.
[13:09:10] <robertmaxrees> the effort to make things promises/a+ compliant means that those extra args may just disappear in a future version.
[13:09:26] <mdiamond> right… “may just disappear in a future version” was the thing I was curious about
[13:09:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that's my guess.
[13:09:37] <mdiamond> alrighty
[13:12:04] <shoky> you're getting all 3 because you're passing multiple "promises" to $.when.  the comment in the upgrade guide is saying that for a single promise, you will only receive a single argument
[13:12:13] <robertmaxrees> ah - there we go.
[13:12:16] <robertmaxrees> derpy.
[13:20:57] <mdiamond> shoky: what about here? https://jsfiddle.net/30mj99rd/3/
[13:21:10] <mdiamond> it seems like there’s currently no restriction on how many arguments will be passed to a .then callback
[13:21:30] <mdiamond> which is totally fine… I was just curious if there will be a restriction in the future
[13:22:59] <robertmaxrees> promises/a+ only allows one last i checked.
[13:23:39] <mdiamond> robertmaxrees: yeah I know, they mention that in the upgrade guide… I’m just asking if/when jQuery will enforce that limit
[13:23:59] <taplar> 3.0 is compliant
[13:24:15] <robertmaxrees> taplar he's seeing more than one arg getting sent to callbacks.
[13:24:35] <mdiamond> yeah, I threw together a short fiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/30mj99rd/3/
[13:24:56] <mdiamond> using jQuery 3.1.0
[13:24:59] <robertmaxrees> also you can have jsfiddle load things for you.
[13:25:52] <taplar> so, what, you'd expect resolve(1,2,3,4) to pass in one argument, an array of those things?
[13:25:54] <mdiamond> robertmaxrees: oh, in the gear dropdown, I see… thanks for the tip
[13:26:13] <mdiamond> taplar: I’m not sure what to expect! it sounds like they’re saying you’ll only get the first argument (1) and none of the others
[13:26:41] <mdiamond> taplar: I’m going off of what I’m reading here: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#callback-invocation
[13:26:48] <robertmaxrees> lol let's just ask the dev chat.  i dropped the question in there for clarification.
[13:27:03] <mdiamond> haha okay
[13:27:50] <robertmaxrees> not sure how long it'll take to get a response, but it should help provide clarity.
[13:47:57] <mdiamond> robertmaxrees: I left for a bit, did they answer our Q?
[13:48:34] <robertmaxrees> <DaveMethvin> robertmaxrees: yeah we could probably clarify that a bit. If you use ONLY jQuery's Deferred it should pass all the args from a resolve but if you start mixing Promise impls the args are truncated to the first
[13:48:45] <robertmaxrees> "so expecting multiple args isn't a good idea"
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> They're thinking about changing "If you are currently using .then()" to "If you mix Promise/A+ implementations in your code"
[13:49:37] <robertmaxrees> mdiamond
[13:50:19] <mdiamond> thanks! yeah I think what threw me off is that they talk about it in the context of using .done/.fail for backwards-compatibility
[13:50:24] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:50:33] <mdiamond> but those won’t help if the original Promise only resolves to one value!
[13:50:35] <robertmaxrees> because .done() and .fail() aren't promises/a+
[13:50:43] <robertmaxrees> they will, actually.
[13:50:47] <robertmaxrees> because they'll follow different rules.
[13:50:50] <mdiamond> hmmm
[13:51:11] <robertmaxrees> so if you want to rely on the "old-style", done/fail.  if you want the compliant stuff, then
[13:51:11] <mdiamond> well… if you’re working with a native Promise then it won’t have .done/.fail methods anyway
[13:51:16] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[13:51:19] <robertmaxrees> that's the whole point :)
[13:51:22] <mdiamond> okay right
[13:51:37] <mdiamond> thanks for the help
[13:51:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.  thanks for asking.  looks like the docs will get updated as a result :)
[13:52:02] <mdiamond> sweet

[14:00:52] <cannap> here for oyu guys http://blog.bugsnag.com/a-warning-about-jquery-3
[14:02:17] <taplar> lol
[14:02:30] <taplar> option #3, put your damn logic at the bottom of your page and forget the doc ready...
[14:03:14] <cannap> tell him
[14:03:34] <robertmaxrees> "Update: Since we published this blog post, the jQuery team released version 3.1.0 to specifically address this issue. "
[14:03:35] <taplar> nah, he seems determined.  i mean he wrote a webpage about it an all
[14:03:51] <cannap> oh
[14:03:55] <cannap> not seen
[14:03:58] <cannap> because contrast!
[14:04:08] <robertmaxrees> and he backed off his complaint.
[14:11:11] <taplar> bugsnag!
[14:46:38] <aro> is there a way to determine if the bottom of a container is inside the viewport?
[14:46:59] <taplar> you'd have to calculate it
[14:47:30] <robertmaxrees> get the top, add the height of the element, check if that number is in the viewport
[14:48:00] <aro> how do i know what the viewport is
[14:48:16] <taplar> clientHeight?
[14:48:22] <robertmaxrees> and by "in the viewport" i mean "check if it's greater than the current scrolltop but less than the current scrolltop - the height of the window"
[14:48:31] <taplar> or maybe $(window).height(), not sure about that though
[14:49:38] <cannap> the viewport is 100% ;P
[14:49:49] <robertmaxrees> .height() will give you the calculated value.
[14:49:51] <robertmaxrees> not the css value.
[14:50:04] <cannap> yea :P
[14:50:19] <cannap> in px
[14:50:46] <taplar> alternatively, you could stick something after the element
[14:50:52] <taplar> then check it's top vs the scrolltop
[14:51:38] <cannap> @aro http://stackoverflow.com/a/125106/2886313
[14:51:53] <cannap> its not jquery but is the same only with $ before ;O
[14:52:08] <cannap> and the offset are different
[14:52:35] <cannap> or check the answer
[14:52:37] <cannap> above
[14:52:57] <cannap> mean this http://stackoverflow.com/a/7557433/2886313

[15:52:53] <joaocastanho> I dont mind do the hard way :P
[15:53:02] <joaocastanho> just need to know how xD
[15:54:04] <robertmaxrees> CORS.
[15:54:13] <robertmaxrees> need to read up on what that is and how to work with it.
[15:54:32] <taplar> i believe it was also yesterday i talked about some ways, so that would be in the logs
[15:54:34] <joaocastanho> I need to place headers in both websites?
[15:54:44] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:55:21] <robertmaxrees> the site in the iframe.  though I to ask - why do you need to use an iframe at all?
[15:55:50] <joaocastanho> it was required too
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[15:55:58] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[15:56:22] <joaocastanho> yeah, really :)
[15:57:41] <joaocastanho> so how would I close the modal ?
[15:58:33] <robertmaxrees> dunno without seeing which lib you're using.
[15:58:50] <joaocastanho> lib for?
[15:58:54] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:58:55] <robertmaxrees> modals?
[15:59:12] <joaocastanho> ah xD jQuery UI dialog
[15:59:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-close
[16:01:59] <joaocastanho> $( "#dialog" ).dialog( "close" ); it doesn't work
[16:02:07] <robertmaxrees> is that the correct selector?
[16:02:28] <joaocastanho> yes, but I did put that code in the iframed website
[16:02:37] <robertmaxrees> did you fix your CORS issue?
[16:03:13] <joaocastanho> I placed this on top
[16:03:20] <joaocastanho> header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: example.com');
[16:03:37] <robertmaxrees> open your console and verify that header is working and that you're not getting errors.
[16:03:45] <robertmaxrees> also: you need to access the parent window.
[16:04:09] <joaocastanho> how do I see if the header did work?
[16:04:11] <robertmaxrees> so you'll do something like window.parent.$
[16:04:54] <joaocastanho> I did the header in PHP
[16:05:25] <robertmaxrees> use the network tab in your dev tools.
[16:05:32] <taplar> actually we should probably say this is a xss issue, not cors
[16:05:58] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:06:15] <joaocastanho> I dont see any errors robertmaxrees
[16:06:16] <robertmaxrees> CORS is designed to prevent XSS
[16:06:29] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho did you see what I said about accessing the parent frame?
[16:06:41] <joaocastanho> Yes
[16:07:01] <joaocastanho> let me try
[16:08:07] <joaocastanho> SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://www.domain.com" from accessing a frame with origin "http://domain2.com". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
[16:08:14] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[16:08:17] <robertmaxrees> CORS.
[16:08:58] <joaocastanho> So the header is not correct?
[16:09:04] <robertmaxrees> that's what it looks like.
[16:10:04] <joaocastanho> which domain should I put here header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.domain.com');
[16:10:33] <taplar> the domain your trying to go to should have that
[16:10:38] <taplar> so the parent.... right?
[16:10:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> the iframe.
[16:10:52] <taplar> >_<, so weird
[16:11:09] <joaocastanho> so which domain should be in the header?
[16:11:11] <arc_> the page that is being remotely accessed is the one that is secured against being remotely accessed
[16:11:11] <joaocastanho> the iframe?
[16:11:19] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:11:35] <joaocastanho> just the domain name or complete url being accessed?
[16:11:42] <taplar> but the parent isn't trying to access the iframes dom, it's the other way around
[16:11:53] <catuca> In this form https://jsfiddle.net/rg8jfn0u/, an user can pick a company type. If they pick Solo Partnership, more inputs should show and it does. It also show a button "Add more partners". But that button only works once! What's going on?
[16:12:04] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho read the error :)
[16:12:14] <robertmaxrees> port, protocol, and domain are what matter.
[16:13:19] <robertmaxrees> catuca forgot to include jquery?
[16:13:27] <catuca> robertmaxrees: How do I do that?
[16:13:33] <catuca> robertmaxrees: thats what I am trying to figure out
[16:13:40] <robertmaxrees> see the gear icon in the upper right of the javascript pane?
[16:13:42] <joaocastanho> so it should be placed in a header too right?
[16:13:45] <robertmaxrees> click that - libraries and extensions
[16:13:59] <robertmaxrees> err, frameworks and extensions.
[16:14:19] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I don't see libraries and extensions
[16:14:34] <robertmaxrees> *frameworks & extensions
[16:14:42] <robertmaxrees> in the menu for the javascript pane.
[16:15:09] <robertmaxrees> click the gear icon next to "javascript" - a menu should open.
[16:15:30] <catuca> robertmaxrees: found it
[16:15:46] <joaocastanho> do I need to add this in both sites robertmaxrees document.domain = 'example.com'
[16:15:53] <taplar> once you got that open your console and try it out catuca
[16:15:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:16:01] <robertmaxrees> document.domain is not your header.
[16:16:45] <catuca> taplar: I did...it is not working
[16:16:46] <arc_> it's talking about http headers not the header in your html file
[16:16:53] <taplar> right, there's an error in the console
[16:16:53] <joaocastanho> where should I place protocols, domains and ports?
[16:17:14] <robertmaxrees> http headers duder.
[16:17:17] <robertmaxrees> server configuration.
[16:18:11] <joaocastanho> I do know it's in the headers, but which name?
[16:18:49] <robertmaxrees> Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[16:19:11] <robertmaxrees> though I might configure that via apache instead.
[16:19:15] <joaocastanho> I have it with the domain only
[16:19:34] <robertmaxrees> did you do any research? lol
[16:19:41] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[16:20:12] <robertmaxrees> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://foo.example
[16:20:56] <joaocastanho> that's what I did robert
[16:21:43] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the headers coming back?
[16:21:56] <robertmaxrees> are you sure you're modifying the right server?
[16:22:07] <joaocastanho> I do
[16:22:15] <joaocastanho> I didn't look at the headers though
[16:22:19] <catuca> taplar: I believe i fixed the errors
[16:24:48] <taplar> new link?
[16:25:22] <blakespot> greetings
[16:25:27] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[16:25:39] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees I checked the headers and the one I setup isn't there
[16:25:52] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho sounds like you didn't do it correctly, then.
[16:26:12] <joaocastanho> should the url be the complete url ?
[16:26:15] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:26:17] <blakespot> I have a simple dropdown menu using a jquery .toggle function to open and close associated div when title is clicked. If menu open I click title and it closes, obviously. I also want to be able to click anywhere else on the page other than the menu div itself, and have it .hide that menu...
[16:26:21] <robertmaxrees> it should be the port, protocol, and domain.
[16:26:29] <robertmaxrees> but if the header isn't coming back.
[16:26:36] <blakespot> if I setup a clickfunction on body, then I can't open the menu becuase it overrides the title div click to .toggle of course
[16:26:44] <joaocastanho> it doesn't even have status code
[16:26:46] <robertmaxrees> that's another problem.  go to ##php and ask how to fix it.
[16:26:48] <catuca> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/pfr4phh0/17/
[16:26:48] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:26:49] <blakespot> is there a jQ way to do a clickfunction on "everything but this one element" ?
[16:26:54] <catuca> taplar: It is still not running as it should
[16:27:07] <robertmaxrees> blakespot why not just use a transparent overlay?
[16:27:36] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: in what way? overlaying the entire page but at a lower z-index than the menu div?
[16:27:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:27:50] <taplar> catuca: ok, so say again, what is not happening that should be happening?
[16:28:34] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: would the overlay approach work if the menu div was contained within it -- say if it it was nested inside body?
[16:28:46] <taplar> btw, your outer function is passing in '$'.  you can use that instead of 'jQuery' all over the place
[16:28:47] <robertmaxrees> blakespot huh?
[16:28:52] <joaocastanho> oh wait
[16:28:52] <catuca> taplar: Well, the fiddle is broken. The onchange should be working when I click on the select box up top.
[16:29:00] <catuca> taplar: not sure what is wrong there
[16:29:14] <robertmaxrees> blakespot otherwise, you'll do a click handler on document and see if the event.target is a child of your menu.
[16:29:23] <robertmaxrees> catuca you had an undefined var last i looked.
[16:29:36] <joaocastanho> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.domain.pt
[16:29:41] <joaocastanho> it's there :)
[16:29:44] <catuca> robertmaxrees: you are right. i fixed those
[16:29:48] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: if the overlay div is just inside body as a wrapper and it contains the menu I click on, that would not work right? It has to not contain the menu -- say be a 100% size div that does not have the menu inside if it correct?
[16:29:50] <catuca> taplar: not all the HTML is there
[16:29:53] <catuca> taplar: gotta fix that
[16:30:08] <robertmaxrees> blakespot that could work.  also look at my other suggestion.,
[16:30:43] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: and if it is a child then ignore it?
[16:30:49] <joaocastanho> if the header is there it should work right robertmaxrees?
[16:31:01] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho if the header is done properly, yeah.
[16:31:04] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:31:25] <robertmaxrees> blakespot yeah.  could use .closest() to see if the click is in the menu and close if not.
[16:31:27] <joaocastanho> none, only when I click the button inside the iframe that error popup
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho no idea then.  i'd have to see it.
[16:32:02] <joaocastanho> would you have time?
[16:32:09] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:32:14] <robertmaxrees> you could toss it out to the channel.
[16:32:19] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[16:32:41] <joaocastanho> okay
[16:33:23] <catuca> taplar: and robertmaxrees I apologize. I did have a broken fiddle. It is not fixed: https://jsfiddle.net/pfr4phh0/20/
[16:33:28] <joaocastanho> One thing I saw is that there's two calls to the same iframe link
[16:33:56] <robertmaxrees> boom  therew we go catuca so how do I replicate?
[16:34:08] <catuca> taplar: and robertmaxrees So from the company type drop down pick Solo Partnership. You will see the more options appear. Then click on "Add more partners". It will add more but I can add no more than 2.
[16:34:27] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I meant to say that I fixed. sorry
[16:34:37] <robertmaxrees> where's the add more?
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> oh it's hiting.
[16:34:52] <robertmaxrees> *hiding
[16:35:08] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Pick "Solo Partnership" from the company type
[16:35:29] <robertmaxrees> i did that - needed to make my window bigger.
[16:35:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pfr4phh0/21/
[16:35:35] <catuca> robertmaxrees: ok
[16:35:36] <robertmaxrees> and it's because you're removing it.
[16:35:40] <catuca> taplar: looking
[16:35:42] <robertmaxrees> need to use a delegated listener instead.
[16:35:47] <taplar> i just changed the jQuery to $
[16:35:49] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[16:35:57] <robertmaxrees> taplar++ thank you.
[16:36:09] <taplar> and don't do on(event, function($){...}
[16:36:17] <taplar> $ in that case is an event
[16:36:25] <taplar> that'll confuse the h out of people
[16:36:26] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[16:36:34] <robertmaxrees> also: $('#company_type').on('change', function() { you're got a handler in a handler here.
[16:36:43] <catuca> taplar: We are still running 1.7.1
[16:36:45] <robertmaxrees> pull that inner one out into its own.
[16:36:48] <catuca> taplar: So I have to do that
[16:37:03] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees http://sabias.pt/alguma-vez-tiveste-na-praia-com-trovoes-olha-so-o-perigo/
[16:37:07] <joaocastanho> click Yes! button
[16:37:14] <taplar> huh?
[16:37:21] <robertmaxrees> catuca jQuery('#company_type').on('change', function($) {  taplar is referring this this.
[16:37:21] <catuca> taplar: the link you sent me still doesn't do what I need it to do
[16:37:37] <robertmaxrees> and taplar onyl fixed the fact that you weren't using $.
[16:37:39] <catuca> robertmaxrees: ah ok
[16:37:41] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I see
[16:37:44] <taplar> i know, i just changed jQuery to $, which your passing into the outer doc ready
[16:37:49] <catuca> taplar: Sorry I misunderstood you
[16:37:56] <catuca> taplar: gotcha. thanks
[16:38:09] <robertmaxrees> catuca so yeah, you need to pull $('#account_details_container .partner .addActionButton').on('click', function() { into a separate handler outside of your initial one.
[16:38:11] <joaocastanho> saw the link robertmaxress?
[16:38:11] <catuca> robertmaxrees: So how do I use a delegate listener to fix this?
[16:38:14] <robertmaxrees> and delegate it.
[16:38:26] <robertmaxrees> do you know what delegated listeners are?
[16:38:32] <catuca> robertmaxrees: no
[16:38:33] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:38:39] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:38:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:38:45] <catuca> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:38:56] <robertmaxrees> basic concept, but make sure you don't just skip to the first example on the api page.
[16:39:03] <robertmaxrees> it's not the delegated example.
[16:39:16] <catuca> robertmaxrees: right. I need to understand it first.
[16:40:54] <joaocastanho> robertmaxrees have you seen something wrong?
[16:41:05] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho i haven't taken a look.
[16:41:17] <robertmaxrees> kind of busy with some other stuff and i don't have time to do a deep dive on your server config issue.
[16:41:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:41:51] <joaocastanho> ah no problem
[16:42:01] <joaocastanho> if someone can take a look would be awesome :)
[16:42:20] <joaocastanho> Is it weird to have two urls in the network tab?
[16:42:27] <joaocastanho> I didn't done two calls though
[16:42:41] <Crash1hd> if I start a function like this 	$(function () <-- is there a way to give it a name?
[16:42:50] <robertmaxrees> Crash1hd yep.
[16:42:54] <Crash1hd> like you do function Foo(){ <-- like this one
[16:42:59] <Crash1hd> but with this $(function ()
[16:43:02] <robertmaxrees> var myThinger = function() {} and then $(myThinger)
[16:43:16] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho every resources on your page is a separate request.
[16:43:27] <taplar> you can even do $(function recursiveMe(){ /* stuff */ recursiveMe(); });
[16:43:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:43:46] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid doing that personally, but it's possible :)
[16:45:16] <Crash1hd> hmm but if I do this     $(function myFoo() { and then call myFoo();l nothing happens?
[16:45:28] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[16:45:34] <robertmaxrees> like, what're you trying to accomplish?
[16:46:01] <Crash1hd>     $(function () <-- this runs anonymously but I would also like to be able to call it later
[16:46:13] <robertmaxrees> define it before and call it as necessary.
[16:46:15] <Crash1hd> without having to add a function call in the function
[16:46:26] <robertmaxrees> though you shouldn't need to do that at all.
[16:46:34] <robertmaxrees> why are you rerunning document ready logic?
[16:47:14] <catuca> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/pfr4phh0/23/
[16:47:19] <Crash1hd> robertmaxrees, need to rerun on an asp.net submit
[16:47:25] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:47:30] <robertmaxrees> that's a page reload, isn't it?
[16:47:35] <catuca> robertmaxrees: The issue now is that it is adding more than once
[16:47:39] <robertmaxrees> catuca errr..
[16:47:46] <robertmaxrees> you need to pull that out of the outer handler.
[16:47:46] <Crash1hd> robertmaxrees, except in this case the page does not reload
[16:48:00] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[16:48:12] <robertmaxrees> catuca also: just use document
[16:48:16] <robertmaxrees> no need for document.body here :)
[16:48:24] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k. Pull it out from the on change one?
[16:48:33] <robertmaxrees> catuca yep.
[16:48:45] <catuca> robertmaxrees: how do I make company_type a global variable then?
[16:49:15] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[16:49:48] <catuca> robertmaxrees: But i need the value of company_type
[16:49:57] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:50:05] <catuca> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/pfr4phh0/25/
[16:50:24] <robertmaxrees> why do you need that value?
[16:50:35] <catuca> robertmaxrees: for the if statement
[16:50:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:50:49] <robertmaxrees> why is the if relevant for whether or not that logic should run?
[16:51:07] <catuca> robertmaxrees: that a good point lol
[16:51:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:51:11] <catuca> robertmaxrees: let me fix that
[16:51:45] <robertmaxrees> you can run that binding no matter what.  it won't really do much unless #account_details_container .partner gets clicked.
[16:52:07] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd check out storing selector results/event handler context
[16:52:56] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: Hmm, I have a div set at full width height absolute pos to 0,0 with click function to .hide the menu, and it does ... but no other links on the page work now. It overrides them. If I set this div's z-index to -500 for ex then it is as if it is not there. The div I speak of does not contain any content, declared at end of page. Hrmph.
[16:53:08] <joaocastanho> so, have anyone checked it?
[16:53:17] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho have you tried asking in ##php
[16:53:24] <robertmaxrees> blakespot you'd have to hide/show it.  i might go with my other suggestion.
[16:53:31] <joaocastanho> I cant join it
[16:53:37] <robertmaxrees> you need to register.
[16:54:01] <catuca> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/pfr4phh0/26/
[16:54:05] <catuca> robertmaxrees: still not working
[16:54:35] <catuca> robertmaxrees: oh...yes..lol
[16:54:39] <joaocastanho> ⓘ [477] ##php, Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[16:54:45] <joaocastanho> this means I need to register?
[16:54:47] <robertmaxrees> yes
[16:54:50] <joaocastanho> ok
[16:55:00] <robertmaxrees> catuca jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ;)
[16:56:14] <catuca> robertmaxrees: now its working. But I have questions..I can't chat now though. I will be back later. Here is the working copy: https://jsfiddle.net/pfr4phh0/28/ and thanks
[16:56:22] <robertmaxrees> 'kay...
[16:56:31] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[17:01:05] <joaocastanho> there's any alternative channel robertmaxrees?
[17:01:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:01:54] <joaocastanho> :)
[17:02:05] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:02:26] <joaocastanho> cant login with this account
[17:05:20] <robertmaxrees> did you register and confirm?
[17:06:05] <joaocastanho> I think I was already registered
[17:06:40] <robertmaxrees> then what's the problem?
[17:06:44] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the assistance. The overlay method is working for me. Much obliged.
[17:06:55] <joaocastanho> it tells me to identify
[17:06:55] <robertmaxrees> blakespot awesome.  glad you figured it out :)
[17:06:59] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho then log in.
[17:07:02] <joaocastanho> I dont know the login credentials
[17:07:02] <joaocastanho> :P
[17:07:07] <blakespot> ...indeed :-)
[17:07:07] <robertmaxrees> then reset the password?
[17:07:14] <joaocastanho> how?
[17:08:33] <robertmaxrees> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=freenode+reset+password
[17:08:35] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho ;)
[17:08:52] <robertmaxrees> there's also #freenode.  they can help you there, too.
[17:12:32] <joaocastanho> okay. thanks
[17:12:44] <joaocastanho> so you guys are not too much into php?
[17:12:44] <joaocastanho> :P
[17:12:53] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[17:12:58] <robertmaxrees> but it IS the jquery channel.
[17:13:00] <robertmaxrees> not the php channel.
[17:13:02] <robertmaxrees> soooo ;)
[17:13:17] <joaocastanho> eheh right :)
[17:13:21] <joaocastanho> thanks
[17:18:23] <graphettion> time to guess his password - maybe it's letmein
[17:18:30] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahhaa
[17:18:34] <graphettion> :P
[17:22:55] <taplar> phss
[17:22:58] <taplar> 'password'
[17:24:29] <taplar> get swanky when it says you should include a special character so you use 'specialcharacter'
[17:38:57] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, are you around?
[17:39:12] <robertmaxrees> along with 580+ other folks, yep :)
[17:39:22] <z1haze> because we all know how active they are
[17:39:27] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:39:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:39:38] <robertmaxrees> toss the question out to the channel.  if somebody can help, they will.
[17:39:40] <z1haze> theres about ~10 people in this channel
[17:39:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm not the only person ever available to help ;)
[17:39:54] <z1haze> nah it was just to continue our discussion from yesterday
[17:40:02] <robertmaxrees> which i will recall nothing about hahaha
[17:40:07] <z1haze> I got off work early today, and wanted to get into the backbone stuff
[17:40:21] <z1haze> memory that bad yea?
[17:40:23] <robertmaxrees> so i'd hit up #documentcloud for that (i think that's the right channel at least)
[17:40:31] <sillyslux> pinging people is kinda rude
[17:40:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:40:40] <z1haze> i went in there yesterday im still yet to get a response from my question that i asked at 7pm last night
[17:40:50] <robertmaxrees> i deal with dozens of people in here every day on top of my dayjob on top of all the other stuff i do outside of work.
[17:40:56] <robertmaxrees> BB is also OT for this channel.
[17:41:12] <z1haze> there isnt a channel thats active for it though
[17:41:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:42:02] <sillyslux> backbone what? php? -> #php js? -> ##javascript
[17:43:35] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i hate to be a jerk but that doesn't really change the topic of this channel (shrug) you can try asking your questions but that doesn't mean you'll get much help.
[17:43:54] <z1haze> ok nvm then
[17:44:21] <z1haze> why are you guys so particular about what exact topics you discuss in a channel, you act like you're getting paid to sit in here
[17:44:25] <z1haze> its just a chat room
[17:44:27] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[17:44:46] <robertmaxrees> i just said you can ask, but your time is better spent somewhere you can get more qualified help on a topic.
[17:44:46] <graphettion> heyyyyyyy
[17:44:48] <z1haze> i just dont understand, its not  you in particular or this channel, most channels people act liek that
[17:44:57] <robertmaxrees> because it circumvents the point of the channel.
[17:45:27] <sillyslux> i do discuss off topic things quite often though
[17:45:31] <sillyslux> for i am silly
[17:45:35] <graphettion> Actually, they don't get paid and take time out of their busy day to help you. ;)
[17:45:42] <z1haze> I guess I just assume most web developrs have a well rounded wheelhouse and could more than likely answer questions related to many topics that interconnect
[17:45:48] <robertmaxrees> it's not for my benefit - it's for you.
[17:45:54] <graphettion> ^
[17:46:10] <z1haze> i help people all day in other channels too, i get it.. im not saying i demand help
[17:46:40] <z1haze> i just figured, if you have the knowledge to explain something to someone, responding with 'this is outside the scope of the channel' seems silly
[17:46:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i said.
[17:46:58] <robertmaxrees> but feel free to put more words in my mouth :)
[17:47:01] <z1haze> thats like calling the police if your house is burning down adn them saying, sorry can you people hang up and call this number
[17:47:06] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:47:11] <robertmaxrees> except that's not at all equivalent.
[17:47:18] <z1haze> im not tryin to be rude, sorry
[17:47:37] <robertmaxrees> you're comparing somebody pointing you to a more qualified resource to calling the police >.>
[17:47:51] <sillyslux> z1haze, whenever i try to help with offtopic stuff, there are no people around to correct me when i'm wron
[17:47:52] <sillyslux> g
[17:48:03] <z1haze> sillyslux, i doubt that
[17:48:22] <robertmaxrees> like i said, you can ask, but my advice may ormay not be very good.
[17:48:25] <z1haze> as i had stated, its highly probably most people in this room have knowledge with more aspects of web devleopment than 'jquery'
[17:48:28] <sillyslux> i'm talking about me, i can tell for sure
[17:48:46] <robertmaxrees> iu hang out in channels i feel qualified to offer advice in / i have have questions for.
[17:48:46] <z1haze> besides, being wrong is ok man
[17:48:59] <z1haze> its not like people pay for your help
[17:49:10] <robertmaxrees> sure, but i'm takling time out of my dayu to help.
[17:49:10] <z1haze> sometimes just tossing out ideas helps
[17:49:42] <z1haze> if its anything like me, i just idle in the channels and when i have a sec i peak at them and help when i can
[17:49:45] <taplar> what was the question?
[17:49:48] <graphettion> So who's voting for Trump? There's an idea. :)
[17:50:03] <sillyslux> but basically, this discussion started b/c pinging someone's name, just avoid that
[17:50:03] <z1haze> graphettion, but see thats outside the scope of this channel, maybe try in #trump
[17:50:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze when you're a mod for a channel, the job's a little different.
[17:50:15] <sillyslux> and you're fine
[17:50:24] <graphettion> But you see, it saturates the channel, z1haze
[17:50:32] <z1haze> i was being sarcastic
[17:50:36] <z1haze> i see no problem with that at all
[17:50:42] <z1haze> unless there are 50 people asking js questions, then sure
[17:50:46] <z1haze> stay on topic
[17:50:52] <z1haze> but when its dead all day, who cares
[17:51:02] <sillyslux> yes
[17:51:09] <graphettion> I think it's great we have filters. People with expert advice in that particular topic can help me more and I don't have to hear about Trump.
[17:51:11] <javnut> I need to make a table that I can multiselect rows, and move my selection up/down with arrow keys
[17:51:12] <graphettion> But suit yourself.
[17:51:16] <sillyslux> but don't start with someone's name
[17:51:37] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you're not reading what i'm telling you.
[17:51:49] <z1haze> ah shit
[17:51:50] <z1haze> nope i wasnt
[17:51:57] <robertmaxrees> go back and reread.
[17:52:07] <z1haze> i thought we didnt pm people without asking
[17:52:22] <sillyslux> z1haze, there are irc clients that even make noise when somebody types your name
[17:52:23] <robertmaxrees> i mean in the channel.
[17:52:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you want to have a problem so badly.  i've said multiple times that we're just pointing you to potentially more helpful resources.
[17:53:04] <robertmaxrees> if you have questions you want to ask, feel free.
[17:53:17] <robertmaxrees> the quality of said support may or may not be questionabl.
[17:53:19] <z1haze> heh i have no problems man, iwas just making discussion
[17:53:26] <robertmaxrees> *questionable
[17:54:40] <z1haze> my question about backbone was, do all templates have to be in the index file inside its own <script type="text/template" or can they be brought in from external files
[17:54:50] <robertmaxrees> they can be through external files.
[17:54:53] <taplar> no rule really
[17:55:05] <taplar> on index saves a request and latency and so on and so forth
[17:55:31] <robertmaxrees> but also lets you conditionally load them on an as-needed basis if you want that.
[17:55:44] <z1haze> gotcha, for a pay, there are often, maybe 10 different components with its own template right?, and if we want every template for every page, you have have 100
[17:55:49] <z1haze> doesnt seem very organized
[17:56:03] <taplar> pay = page?
[17:56:07] <z1haze> yes, my bad
[17:56:11] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:56:11] <robertmaxrees> you'
[17:56:23] <robertmaxrees> *you'd never structure your app like that to begin with.
[17:56:51] <z1haze> im imagining a dashboard panel
[17:56:56] <z1haze> each widget being its own component
[17:57:02] <robertmaxrees> you want subviews
[17:57:25] <z1haze> so all thes partials, i would make them all in the same file, or separate
[17:57:42] <taplar> segregate them by component
[17:57:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd do separate ones.
[17:57:50] <z1haze> ok
[17:58:10] <z1haze> weird that i have trouble with javascript mvc, but php mvc is easy for me
[17:58:16] <z1haze> it should be the same stuff
[17:58:24] <robertmaxrees> because javascript isn't OO in the same way PHP is.
[17:58:35] <robertmaxrees> also: every MVC framework is a little different.
[17:58:48] <z1haze> well backbone doesnt even have a controller
[17:58:53] <z1haze> so its not even mvc
[17:58:54] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:58:58] <robertmaxrees> yes it does
[17:59:06] <z1haze> not from what im seeing
[17:59:17] <taplar> segregating templates by components is just going to save you headaches tracking stuff down.  its more about organization really
[17:59:23] <robertmaxrees> well, collections of models.  it expects that your backend is your controller
[17:59:34] <robertmaxrees> it's more of a MV*
[17:59:45] <robertmaxrees> like most frontend JS frameworks
[17:59:52] <robertmaxrees> like angular does MVVM
[17:59:54] <z1haze> why do we need models on the front end though
[18:00:01] <robertmaxrees> those broker interaction with your backend.
[18:00:19] <robertmaxrees> http://backbonejs.org/#Model explains it pretty well.
[18:00:25] <graphettion> And Knockout
[18:00:48] <graphettion> So you can get live updated information on the front-end?
[18:00:55] <graphettion> As the database updates
[18:01:01] <taplar> z1haze: are you asking the point of models in general or just in regards to javascript?
[18:01:07] <z1haze> javascript specifically
[18:01:17] <z1haze> models, i get, for the backend
[18:01:26] <taplar> pretty much the same purpose
[18:01:36] <taplar> your front end doesn't have to know your back end structure
[18:01:54] <z1haze> so its like im building the same thing twice
[18:01:58] <z1haze> a mirror image
[18:02:09] <robertmaxrees> the view should only interact with the document.  the model is what brokers between the view and the backend.
[18:02:12] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[18:02:53] <z1haze> like my js router sends to the server, then the backend router picks it up, sends to backend controller, returns to the front end again
[18:02:58] <taplar> my frontend needs x, y, z, but my back end has to get a and b to create y.  front end doesn't need to know that.  it just needs x, y, z
[18:03:23] <z1haze> yea i suppose, i guess i just am so used to rendering my views serverside is why im so confused
[18:03:51] <z1haze> so with a js framework you just need more like an api that returns json
[18:03:52] <taplar> tomorrow we get a new product.  b is replaced with c and d.  but frontend still just needs x, y, z
[18:03:53] <taplar> ;)
[18:04:09] <robertmaxrees> z1haze with what you're trying to do, yes.
[18:04:22] <z1haze> ok
[18:04:50] <robertmaxrees> hell i'd do a more isomorphic app personally, but that'd require much more archiecting.
[18:04:54] <robertmaxrees> *architecting
[18:05:25] <z1haze> whatever that is  :)
[18:05:35] <robertmaxrees> planning for the end result you wnat.
[18:05:36] <robertmaxrees> *want
[18:05:46] <robertmaxrees> iirc you've already built your app.
[18:05:56] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to redo a lot of your backend to get what you're really looking for.
[18:06:28] <z1haze> this says 'front end and backend use the same code'
[18:06:42] <robertmaxrees> you could do that if you were running node
[18:06:57] <z1haze> ah, right
[18:07:28] <z1haze> and yea, the app is done, but that doesnt mean i wont branch it and make new stuff
[18:10:42] <taplar> always fun to try different approaches
[18:10:57] <taplar> especially if its a hobby project
[18:11:38] <z1haze> what made me want to do it was i came across this: http://demo.flatlogic.com/3.3.1/dark/index.html i thought it was really nice .. but thats just my opinion
[18:11:56] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:12:39] <taplar> i like the color scheme.  wish i could do crap like that
[18:12:59] <robertmaxrees> looks like nv3d
[18:13:03] <robertmaxrees> err, nvd3
[18:13:57] <taplar> using node you could websocket that chat widgit
[18:19:16] <taplar> speaking of off topic questions.  maybe others will have some input.  what are some common techniques used for showing menus on mobile devices?  do a lot of them use any sort of double tap or side swipe a lot?  aside from the hamburger of course
[18:19:36] <robertmaxrees> side swipe.  double-tap is a little unusual.
[18:21:20] <taplar> i'll have to play around with that.  i got the hamburger pretty much down, but i think my next subsection is going to have a lot of options i'll have to manage, :s
[18:22:49] <taplar> managing the clutter.  my new frontier, :D
[18:23:12] <robertmaxrees> options or sections?
[18:23:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:23:59] <taplar> definately options, but also more like steps than sections
[18:24:15] <taplar> its a game character planner
[18:24:35] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want a different ui for that maybe?
[18:25:02] <robertmaxrees> www.bikologi.com click "start here" and then pick a bike.
[18:25:05] <robertmaxrees> maybe something like this?
[18:27:38] <taplar> man i idk if my network hates that or it's a heavy site but it's transitioning super slow for me
[18:27:48] <robertmaxrees> it's way heavy
[18:29:20] <taplar> hmm
[18:29:35] <taplar> ah, ic
[18:30:27] <robertmaxrees> well that was exciting.
[18:30:35] <robertmaxrees> a whole lot of anger for no real reason.
[18:30:59] <taplar> that might be interesting.  its funny.  looking at it i feel like the menus are taking up a majority of the vertical space but i kinda dont might it.  wouldn't do it that much, but interesting
[18:31:08] <taplar> might= mind
[18:31:11] <robertmaxrees> right?
[18:31:28] <robertmaxrees> it's product configuration taken to the next level.
[18:31:39] <taplar> oh shit!  the menu scrolls, lmao
[18:31:45] <taplar> never would have thought of that right off
[18:32:10] <taplar> defo making a note of this, muy gracias
[18:32:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.  i used to work with the dude who started that site.
[18:32:25] <robertmaxrees> interesting dude.
[18:36:16] <taplar> you know the dude?  i need to check it on my actual phone, but it looks like on the ff mobile viewer that the menus only scroll on the frame tab, the others extend off screen without a scroll
[18:36:36] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) he probablly only checked chrome.
[18:36:42] <robertmaxrees> might be doing user agent detection.
[18:37:20] <taplar> yeah, fine on the phone
[18:38:15] <taplar> heh also loaded faster.  anyway i'm out.  have a good weekend
[18:38:19] <robertmaxrees> enjoy
[19:21:05] <Forbidd3n> Hey everyone. Quick question. When I use $.ajax and in my success method I am adding options to a drop down. If async is set to false, then they don't get added to the element, but if async is left to the default of true, it does. Any ideas?
[19:21:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your code.
[19:35:20] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know what the code would be to slide left and fade out as it is sliding?
[19:35:56] <robertmaxrees> .animate({left: 0, opacity: 255}) something like this maybe?
[19:38:56] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I want it to fade out while sliding to the left
[19:39:05] <Forbidd3n> wound't left have to be negative?
[19:39:08] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:39:11] <Forbidd3n> wouldn't
[19:39:13] <robertmaxrees> "something like this maybe?"
[19:39:16] <robertmaxrees> that's what that means.
[19:39:23] <robertmaxrees> you just animate those two properties.
[19:40:18] <robertmaxrees> the correct values are up to you.
[19:41:21] <Forbidd3n> setting the opacity to 0 fades it out, but left: 0 or left: -999 either way it doesn't move
[19:41:28] <robertmaxrees> try margin-left
[19:41:43] <robertmaxrees> set to a negative value
[19:42:33] <Forbidd3n> ok that works, but slides to the left of the page, anyway to make it slide to the left of the div container
[19:43:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you're working with.
[19:44:35] <Forbidd3n> I just have a parent div and in it a child div with an id - I have this code $('#btn-step1').on('click', function(event){ $('#step1').animate({'margin-left': -300, opacity: 0}); });
[19:44:49] <Forbidd3n> the child div id is #step1
[19:45:00] <Forbidd3n> minus the '#'
[19:45:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:45:06] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[19:46:30] <Forbidd3n> ?
[19:46:43] <robertmaxrees> could just make a fiddle.
[19:46:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:49:13] <ProgBot> Is there any way to make a draggable element's handle a parent element?
[19:49:42] <ProgBot> In my case, I want to be able to drag anywhere on the page to move a draggable element
[21:05:43] <z1haze> can anyone weigh in on grunt vs gulp, who have used both?
[22:07:38] <jeromelanteri> I do link a bootstrap carousel with a table of pictures with a mouseover/mouseout (include a timer for removed bounce, catch real intention). Works fine. After that, i add a pager for have all the time a 10 pictures view inside table, then change page for see other pictures... but the problem now is that when i change page of table view, and i come back to the first view of table content, it seems like the carousel has
[22:07:39] <jeromelanteri> many counter (many carousel running in same time).
[22:08:24] <jeromelanteri> i have absolutly no idea why this happen. i'm searching someone who can help me on that.
