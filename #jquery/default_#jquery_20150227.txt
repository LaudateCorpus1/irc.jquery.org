[00:56:09] <iamjimmy> Cork: Worked for me, thanks
[01:03:08] <iamjimmy> cork: if we have multiple buttons with the same id, how can we assign separate task to each of them on click
[01:04:23] <Uhkis> iamjimmy: you dont have multiple buttons with the same id.
[01:04:41] <iamjimmy> they are generated during a loop
[01:04:53] <Uhkis> then you need to fix your generator
[01:04:57] <Cork> iamjimmy: you would have to fix the attribute to be valid
[01:05:12] <Cork> id by definition is an unique identification of a single element
[01:05:36] <iamjimmy> Alright let me try and get back to you guys
[01:05:38] <Cork> having two elements with the same id is invalid
[01:06:50] <iamjimmy> well even if i assign different ids to them, how can I make generic event to handle the call for every id
[01:07:11] <Cork> iamjimmy: if you want them to do the same thing, use a class
[01:07:21] <Cork> iamjimmy: if you want unique actions use separate event handlers
[01:07:56] <iamjimmy> I want to send ajax request with different val()s of inputs, for everybutton
[01:08:21] <iamjimmy> so if I click on first one, that event should add the input box values to parameters in ajax request
[01:19:52] <iamjimmy> Cork: do you think .on is the right way to do so
[01:19:52] <iamjimmy> ?
[01:20:14] <imolorhe> Hi
[01:21:30] <imolorhe> Which is a more expensive operation...updating the text() and checked states of 500 filter options, or creating the 500 options with the updated text and states?
[01:23:08] <Cork> iamjimmy: sorry got busy for a little while
[01:24:03] <Cork> iamjimmy: if only what fields should be included differ i would define the fields by class names and have a data-target or something on the button
[01:24:10] <Cork> iamjimmy: and then select the elements to use based on that
[01:24:43] <Cork> imolorhe: the updating, cause you modify the dom 500 times
[01:25:29] <Cork> imolorhe: while if you do the other one correctly it can be done as one dom modification (use string or create a dom fragment and then attache it the dom)
[01:25:32] <imolorhe> but updating the text property and the checked value is technically updating the DOM as well
[01:25:55] <Cork> imolorhe: that is the one i talked about as updating it 500 times
[01:26:01] <imolorhe> ok
[01:26:02] <Cork> or actually 1000 times
[01:26:15] <Cork> as you do the text modification and state modification separately
[01:26:27] <pcpanic_> Hi guys, noob here, https://gist.github.com/ysinc88/2ee6d86c3658a7bb6ca0#file-mini-gallery-html-erb
[01:26:31] <Cork> though the state modification isn't as high a cost i think (never tested though)
[01:26:50] <imolorhe> Ok so creating the filter options and rebinding events is much better?
[01:26:51] <imolorhe> ok
[01:27:08] <Cork> imolorhe: if possible have a shared event handler (delegated) on a static parent
[01:27:37] <Cork> cause ya adding lots and lots of event handlers is really bad for performance
[01:27:37] <imolorhe> ok thanks
[01:28:06] <pcpanic_> hovered image to display on target div anyone :) ?
[01:28:09] <imolorhe> Cork: what kind of scripts can block or freeze the UI
[01:28:11] <imolorhe> ?
[01:28:25] <Cork> pcpanic_: ask the question if you want an answer
[01:28:29] <Cork> ?ask @ pcpanic_
[01:28:29] <b-ot> pcpanic_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:28:40] <Cork> imolorhe: any script
[01:28:56] <Cork> webpages is by design single threaded
[01:29:06] <Cork> so drawing, and code runs on the same thread
[01:29:08] <imolorhe> ok that's why I asked the original question
[01:29:16] <Cork> and updates isn't allowed while js runs
[01:29:39] <pcpanic_> woops :) So I have a bar with 3 thumbs which I want displayed in a target div .main-image when hovered, code is here: https://gist.github.com/ysinc88/2ee6d86c3658a7bb6ca0#file-mini-gallery-html-erb
[01:29:43] <imolorhe> The UI freezes for about 3 seconds when performing the filter options update or creation
[01:29:44] <Cork> imolorhe: each time you append/attach an element to the dom you trigger something called reflow
[01:29:51] <Cork> and that is the most expensive action the browser has
[01:30:01] <Cork> so you want to minimize that as much as possible
[01:31:07] <Cork> pcpanic_: so you want to show the matching img tag inside .main-image?
[01:31:19] <pcpanic_> Cork: Yes sir
[01:31:44] <Cork> $('.main-image img').eq($(this).index()).show()/.hide()
[01:32:05] <Cork> in the two event actions (hover and out)
[01:34:52] <pcpanic_> Cork: Trying to apply your code, I'll get a new fiddle so I can do this live instead of this dynamic ruby thingy, Thanks!
[01:46:32] <pcpanic_> Cork: Alright, example here, http://jsfiddle.net/ysinc88/tsz87hwy/5/ - Where do I get your code in?
[01:46:54] <pcpanic_> Once again - I'm really new to this...
[01:51:25] <DreamStiffler> ..Hi guys
[01:51:28] <DreamStiffler> anyone here?
[01:51:36] <DreamStiffler> I need to get data from span
[01:51:48] <DreamStiffler> sorry text from the strong html tag
[01:52:00] <DreamStiffler> Heres my code
[01:53:09] <DreamStiffler> http://jsfiddle.net/by3zkp54/19/
[01:53:27] <DreamStiffler> and the data im retrieving snippets are at http://pastebin.com/NVxeetL4
[01:54:06] <jaggz> How do I show() some div's I've hidden with display:none; ?   $('#rightcolumn').children('div')[0].show() says "undefined is not a function"?
[01:54:16] <jaggz> s/?$//
[01:54:17] <Uhkis> DreamStiffler: $('strong').text();
[01:55:32] <Omar-> jaggz  $('#rightcolumn').children('div')[0] is wrong remove [0]
[01:55:41] <Omar-> $('#rightcolumn').children('div').show()
[01:56:33] <jaggz> I need to pick just one of them.. I'm actually using an index
[01:56:42] <jaggz> http://jsfiddle.net/j6u3tkm6/
[01:56:48] <Omar-> in that case use .eq()
[01:56:59] <jaggz> trying to have clicks (or mouseover's) display some corresponding div's
[01:57:09] <Omar-> $('#rightcolumn').children('div:eq(0)').show() or $('#rightcolumn').children('div').eq(0).show()
[01:57:56] <jaggz> eeenteresting
[01:58:19] <jaggz> what is [0] doing there?
[01:58:33] <jaggz> it displays my element <div>foo</div> if I put it in console
[01:58:38] <jaggz> (without the .show() on the end)
[01:59:43] <Omar-> jaggz [0] returns string
[01:59:49] <jaggz> thank you :)
[01:59:52] <Omar-> .eq(0) jQuery object
[01:59:59] <Omar-> $() = jq object
[02:00:04] <Omar-> not the same ;)
[02:00:06] <Omar-> np
[02:01:36] <Cork> pcpanic_: you only have one image in each position, could you make one that reflects how it will actually look?
[02:02:29] <Cork> wtf... sql in ajax call?!?
[02:03:29] <mooncup> lol
[02:05:11] <mooncup> wait yahoo allows you to send your own sql? o.0
[02:05:48] <mooncup> Cork: https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/
[02:08:07] <Cork> ya
[02:08:18] <DreamStiffler> Uhkis: thanks. yours helped till i get back to this.strong . i tried it before but it didnt work. ok now im gna be here for a while
[02:18:44] <surianup> HI all
[02:19:16] <surianup> Ho can I check that where the jquery code has placed for form
[02:19:29] <surianup> plugin
[02:19:47] <Cork> where it was placed?
[02:19:52] <Cork> what do you mean?
[02:20:08] <Cork> where the script tag that loaded the js is located?
[02:20:14] <DreamStiffler> Uhkis , Cork : u both know i sucked at coding right. I mean I really sucked. I pick up here and there as I go. Im a HTML / Graphic designer. So all this coding is giving me headaches. So can you help me simplify what I have done here. I just need the date to be before each data.
[02:20:17] <DreamStiffler> http://jsfiddle.net/by3zkp54/34/
[02:20:40] <DreamStiffler> i mean i want date + url in each line
[02:21:06] <pcpanic_> Cork: Done, http://jsfiddle.net/ysinc88/tsz87hwy/6/
[02:21:32] <DreamStiffler> Why i did this way is because i dont know how to grab the <span> and the <a> in one go. As theyre siblings. SO in my limited knowledge, i requested it twice.
[02:22:00] <surianup> I have multiple html forms and it is posting with ajax method and I don't know where this jquery code has written either in js file or anything else as I have checked my php file there is no code and also I have checked the header and footer file there is also not  placed ,so how can I search the code where is it?
[02:22:13] <DreamStiffler> and dont let /34/ fool you...probably the 909th
[02:22:13] <Cork> pcpanic_: ok, so you won't have the big images loaded as extra tags?
[02:23:04] <pcpanic_> Cork: extra tags ? their will be 1 main + 3 thumbs, when hovering over a thumb it will display in .main-image
[02:23:27] <surianup> Cork
[02:23:28] <surianup> : how can you search this ?can you please explain?
[02:24:22] <Cork> pcpanic_: http://jsfiddle.net/tsz87hwy/8/
[02:24:34] <Cork> i expected you to use smaller images for the thumbs
[02:24:44] <Cork> so i was looking for a more complext solution :()
[02:24:44] <surianup> Bro guide me please
[02:24:46] <Cork> *:)
[02:25:47] <pcpanic_> Cork: You da man!!! Thanks! so nice and elegant :)
[02:26:03] <Cork> DreamStiffler: you would have to identify the div/a you create in the first ajax call and then append the new content to it
[02:26:17] <Cork> DreamStiffler: but that also means you have to wait for the first call to end so you don't get a race
[02:26:27] <Cork> $.when can make that fairly simple
[02:27:03] <DreamStiffler> And Cork master how do i do this. Ive been reading til differed and im not sure if thatll help. So when.
[02:27:37] <DreamStiffler> actually differed is when...lol
[02:27:39] <DreamStiffler> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[02:27:50] <DreamStiffler> but how do i apply this to my code
[02:27:54] <DreamStiffler> Cork:
[02:33:57] <Cork> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/by3zkp54/36/
[02:34:08] <Cork> though the api returns null for results not sure what happens there
[02:35:14] <Cork> surianup: your best option is to make a search for the id of the form or something like that
[02:35:16] <Uhkis> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/by3zkp54/37/ like this?
[02:35:23] <Uhkis> Cork: it timeouts a lot
[02:35:31] <Cork> surianup: js doesn't keep any references to where it comes from
[02:35:50] <Cork> Uhkis: you want to avoid the append in a loop if possible
[02:36:19] <Uhkis> Cork: true
[02:36:24] <DreamStiffler> Thank you both Master Uhkis and Master Cork . I will be trying to understand what you both did now
[02:37:55] <Uhkis> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/by3zkp54/38/ improved a bit
[02:39:17] <Uhkis> hmm..
[02:40:10] <Uhkis> wow, that yahoo api doesn't care about cors
[02:40:35] <Uhkis> nice workaround
[02:42:32] <adv_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28756667/two-popups-in-a-listview-with-jquery-mobile/ , i don't understand how to use the answer , can anyone show with a jsfiddle?
[02:42:43] <DreamStiffler> its legal right
[02:42:47] <DreamStiffler> Okay i just went through
[02:43:01] <DreamStiffler> didnt know that you can do something like this +this.span.content
[02:43:09] <DreamStiffler> and a lot other more
[02:43:37] <Omar-> adv_ you cant have more than one active popup at the same time
[02:44:12] <DreamStiffler> Whatever its worth thank you so much. I am going to continue studying the code. Because i know asking for explanation here is just going to give me more headaches. No pun to u gurus, just that i learn better listening rather than reading
[02:45:23] <Uhkis> DreamStiffler: still doing that stuff on drupal?
[02:45:56] <adv_> Omar-: workaround/alternative?
[02:45:57] <DreamStiffler> Uhkis: haha u remembered. Yeah but on hold now. Struggling but yeah
[02:46:16] <DreamStiffler> Uhkis: guess u did check them logs. Now working with Liferay though
[02:46:40] <DreamStiffler> Uhkis: nuttier by the day. great to have you peeps still around in irc
[02:46:51] <Uhkis> DreamStiffler: nah, i just remember everything pointless :D
[02:47:11] <DreamStiffler> ...
[02:47:11] <Omar-> adv_ you can close current popup and then open edit one
[02:47:37] <DreamStiffler> Uhkis: not sure if i am to feel offended or what
[02:47:37] <Omar-> which jQM version are you using?
[02:48:09] <Uhkis> DreamStiffler: pointless meaning "hey, that dude has been on #drupal and #jquery"
[02:48:20] <adv_> Omar-: 1.4.3
[02:48:32] <Uhkis> DreamStiffler: and no you shouldn't feel offended, nothing to do with you :)
[02:48:38] <DreamStiffler> Uhkis: ok cool
[02:50:38] <adv_> Omar-: how to close current and open edit one?
[02:52:20] <Omar-> adv_ http://jsfiddle.net/L0rpa10z/
[02:53:10] <adv_> Omar-: hm thanks, kinda unresponsive though
[02:53:24] <Omar-> this is better http://jsfiddle.net/fdpboavx/
[02:55:05] <Omar-> 250ms delay http://jsfiddle.net/psame0q0/
[02:55:23] <adv_> Omar-: nice!
[02:55:39] <adv_> is this safe to use?
[02:55:45] <pcpanic_> So, how do I make the thumbs change the closest #main-image src rather than the first one ? http://jsfiddle.net/ysinc88/tsz87hwy/9/
[02:56:06] <Omar-> better one adv_ http://jsfiddle.net/szdzdgky/
[02:56:09] <Omar-> no setTimeout
[02:56:21] <Omar-> but remove href="#edit" in edit button
[02:56:33] <Omar-> replace it with href="#" or just remove it
[02:57:31] <Omar-> adv_ final version: http://jsfiddle.net/psgu4y9j/
[02:57:35] <adv_> hm how does that work? it looks like chained popups
[02:57:56] <Omar-> adv_ I used popupafterclose event
[02:58:06] <Omar-> to open edit popup
[02:58:11] <adv_> ah
[02:58:15] <Omar-> i use .one() not .on()
[02:58:26] <Omar-> because you want to bind it one time only
[02:58:51] <Omar-> if you use .on(), edit popup will open whenever purchase popup is closed
[02:59:03] <Omar-> we need to open it only when "edit" button is clicked
[02:59:37] <adv_> fantastic, thanks!
[02:59:48] <Omar-> add your answer on SO, tell them it was from Omar :P
[02:59:55] <Omar-> i'll upvote it for you
[03:04:48] <basiclaser> hi guyds
[03:05:02] <pcpanic_> How do I apply ."closest" for it to catch the nearest #main-image ? http://jsfiddle.net/ysinc88/tsz87hwy/9/
[03:05:04] <adv_> Omar-: done
[03:11:48] <Omar-> pcpanic_     $(this).closest(".mini-images").prev('.main-image').find("img").prop('src', this.src);
[03:12:46] <Cork> pcpanic_: you don't do closest for an id
[03:12:52] <Cork> as the id is unique
[03:13:09] <Cork> that's why i added the id, as you didn't use multiple images
[03:14:31] <pcpanic_> Cork: What would you do in case of multiples ? Omar- Not sure how to apply the code to the fiddle
[03:14:52] <Cork> pcpanic_: multiple images in what case?
[03:15:07] <Cork> like i said, please provide a fiddle the reflects what you need to work with
[03:15:18] <pcpanic_> I have several products on the sme page, each product has a main image and 3 thumbs underneath it,
[03:15:26] <Cork> ah
[03:15:39] <pcpanic_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ysinc88/tsz87hwy/9/
[03:15:56] <Omar-> pcpanic_ use classes as Cork said. http://jsfiddle.net/e2a90w1h/
[03:16:07] <Cork> pcpanic_: http://jsfiddle.net/tsz87hwy/10/
[03:16:07] <Omar-> avoid duplicate IDs in one document
[03:16:17] <Cork> Omar-: i added the id
[03:16:24] <Cork> opps typo
[03:16:34] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/tsz87hwy/11/
[03:16:56] <Cork> Omar-: using .prev like that is kinda risky
[03:17:09] <Cork> cause if there ever come anything inbetween the two elements the script will break
[03:17:50] <Omar-> Cork in case you aren't sure what's the previous sibling, true
[03:18:10] <Cork> Omar-: and if you are sure, why the selector?
[03:18:13] <Cork> just use .perv()
[03:18:19] <Cork> *prev
[03:18:49] <Omar-> Cork hmmm, I was in a hurry haha
[03:18:53] <Cork> :)
[03:19:16] <Cork> i usually use prevAll('').first() instead
[03:19:22] <Cork> much more powerful command
[03:19:29] <pcpanic_> I lost you guys
[03:19:30] <DreamStiffler> Ok thanks guys. Catcha layters.
[03:19:50] <Cork> pcpanic_: check /10/ it will give you your solution
[03:19:59] <Cork> opps sorry 11
[03:20:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/tsz87hwy/11/ <--
[03:22:03] <pcpanic_> yes yes, got that, I am so very thankful for you piece of mind with strangers, HIGHLY HIGHLY appreciated
[03:22:12] <stangeland> Is there any way i can check if an image is in the cache? like if(incache(myimgurl)){/* do stuff */ }
[03:22:24] <Cork> stangeland: not really
[03:22:42] <Cork> you can add the image and time how long it will take for load to fire
[03:22:43] <surianup> I need three records from from table with id 3, 4, 5
[03:22:48] <Cork> but that's it
[03:22:57] <stangeland> Cork, damn :/ basically i dont want to make a specific .$get if image is already in cache
[03:23:03] <surianup> please let me know
[03:23:21] <Cork> stangeland: you can't know
[03:23:36] <Cork> actually the browser might throw the image away at any time if it feels it needs to
[03:27:10] <stangeland> Cork, i wonder why its not possible...shouldnt be that difficult to make for the browser vendors
[03:27:36] <Cork> stangeland: exposing cache status is actually a bad thing
[03:27:45] <Cork> it can be used to track the user around the web
[03:27:51] <stangeland> Cork, how so?
[03:28:11] <Cork> load image you know no one else will load
[03:28:17] <Cork> * check if image is in cache
[03:28:32] <Cork> * uniquely identified the user cross domain
[03:28:55] <stangeland> hmm ok.... that sounds to advanced for me hehe :)
[03:29:30] <Cork> they are already doing it somewhat with .load
[03:29:52] <Cork> but its unpredictable cause loading from storage might just take a little time
[03:40:04] <Tennis> Hey I've got possibly a 1 line issue
[03:40:12] <Tennis> only happening in chrome , works perfectly in firefox
[03:40:24] <Tennis> setInterval(function()loadXMLDoc(),3000);
[03:40:34] <Tennis> this line is throwing an uncaught syntax error in chrome
[03:40:51] <Tennis> setInterval(loadXMLDoc(),3000) this gets rid of the error
[03:40:58] <Tennis> but it stops sending requests asynchronously
[03:41:07] <Tennis> can anybody see where the error of my ways is
[03:41:11] <Tennis> or otherwise shed some light?
[03:42:02] <Cork> Tennis: function()loadXMLDoc() isn't valid js5
[03:42:16] <Cork> that is a javascript 1.8 extension
[03:42:53] <Cork> js5 writes that as function() { loadXMLDoc() }
[03:43:10] <Tennis> ahh thanks let me give that try
[03:43:15] <Cork> but as you don't pass any arguments you can shorten that to setInterval, loadXMLDoc, 3000)
[03:43:23] <Cork> opps
[03:43:28] <Cork> setInterval(loadXMLDoc, 3000)
[03:43:45] <Cork> Tennis: also be careful with setInterval
[03:43:56] <Cork> you most likely want to use setTimeout instead
[03:44:12] <Tennis> Cork Beuler you're my hero
[03:44:26] <Tennis> Yeah I red setTimeout is better on stackoverflow
[03:44:43] <Cork> setInterval has a scary effect that it doesn't account for the time it takes for the code to run
[03:44:58] <Cork> so if the computer gets busy, or goes to sleep or something like that
[03:45:14] <Cork> you can/will end up with it running constantly with calls back to back when it starts again
[03:45:26] <Cork> (cause the execution of the function has been queued up)
[03:45:30] <Tennis> does Timeout have the desired reuslt
[03:45:48] <Cork> you have to queue it again after each time the function executes
[03:46:03] <Cork> so you delay the next execution by the time it took the first loop to execute
[03:46:18] <Cork> and there by never a risk if "queuing up"
[03:46:40] <Tennis> cool
[03:46:46] <Tennis> that's perfect
[03:54:45] <Fod> Hello guys. I'm very new to Jquery. I'm trying to create a form based upon which DIV has been clicked.
[03:54:54] <Fod> However, i want to toggle the div and form element
[03:55:20] <Fod> would i try and find by ID, if that ID doesnt exist, then append a new field?
[03:55:45] <Fod> else, if the ID does exist, then hide() that field?
[04:02:32] <Cork> Fod: if possible create a fiddle of what you try to work with
[04:02:41] <Cork> it makes it much easier to give a good answer
[04:08:17] <Fod> Cork: sounds good, i just need to do something first :) thanks for your time though

[04:46:00] <kongthap> hi, i .js in 2 files, this is part of the files http://pastie.org/9987188, i can render the page, but deligating is not working??? please hint
[04:49:24] <Uhkis> is that table there before that click bind?
[04:49:56] <kum> searched but not find any good choice
[05:27:45] <phper> I have some php code included at the top of a page ( <?php include base.php?>) that has queries in it, and then code in the page that prints out varibles from base.php. How can I reload the variables from base.php without refreshing the entire page?
[05:32:21] <BrazenBraden> hey guys... anyone used bootstrap with jQuery Isotope?
[05:34:52] <tomasm-> hey, anyone know if there is a plugin that can do the type of pull out menu/customization form that a lot of templates out there have? it seems pretty common so I wasn't sure if there was a library that did it - and if there is some backend integration (ie ajax to save it to a database)? example (the palette on the left): http://demos.churchthemes.com/resurrect/contact/
[05:38:09] <ExtraSteve> tomasm-: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[05:38:48] <ExtraSteve> phper: you need ajax for that
[05:40:13] <ExtraSteve> phper: make a js/jquery function called getVariables or something. Have that perform an ajax call to your base.php script. base.php should print a json string of your variables. base.php should then pull apart that json string and assign values to local variables in your js code
[05:40:32] <ExtraSteve> Then call getVariables() whenever you want
[05:41:58] <ExtraSteve> jquery's documentation on $.ajax is a bit... dense. You might prefer w3schools' if you're a beginner: http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ajax_ajax.asp
[05:42:42] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[05:42:43] <b-ot> Cork: W3Fools – Better web education for all → http://www.w3fools.com/
[05:42:53] <Cork> don't use w3schools for reference
[05:44:13] <ExtraSteve> It often has some good examples, but for a primary source of reference I'd always recommend the official sites
[05:44:59] <ExtraSteve> s/reference/documentation
[05:45:16] <phper> ExtraSteve: could this work if base.php is all global variables being defined
[05:45:27] <phper> i'm using it in different pages on the site
[05:46:45] <ExtraSteve> phper: that's a bit of a flawed way of doing it, if you ask me. You have no control over what's being defined and what isn't.
[05:47:42] <ExtraSteve> If you do it with an ajax call, you can pass in a parameter via post/get and specify which page is doing the including also - so you get the right set of variables being defined
[05:48:17] <Cork> ExtraSteve: the problem is that w3schools has bad examples/documentation
[05:48:29] <Cork> so that is exactly why it shouldn't be used for that
[05:48:42] <phper> is there any way to do it without encoding it in a json string?
[05:49:26] <Cork> phper: you could send a straight request and have the server send the generated html back
[05:49:26] <ExtraSteve> phper: you could encode it however you wanted, really. It's just that your return function is going to have to interpret the results
[05:49:32] <Cork> then you could just send straight text/html
[05:50:05] <phper> Cork: the php doesn't have any html in it
[05:50:10] <Cork> but ya, if you need structured data it is definitely better to use json
[05:50:14] <phper> it's just defining variables
[05:50:36] <Cork> phper: variables can't be transfered over the net
[05:50:51] <Cork> you have to generate a text markup for it, and json is among the best for that
[05:50:55] <phper> what do you mean?
[05:51:09] <Cork> if you have $something = 42 in php
[05:51:14] <Cork> that is in the servers memory
[05:51:30] <Cork> to get that into the browser it has to be converted to text and sent over the http connection
[05:51:41] <Cork> as http is text only (basically)
[05:52:09] <Cork> the simplest solution to do this is to simply use json_encode server side
[05:52:19] <Cork> and create an php array
[05:52:25] <Cork> and just echo the result
[05:52:58] <phper> hmm
[05:53:00] <ExtraSteve> And then use the response string (in your js) to set the variables you want set
[05:53:12] <phper> can jquery interface with this array
[05:53:15] <Cork> ya, just make sure to set the header Content-Type correctly
[05:53:28] <Cork> phper: it will automatically parse the json to javascript data types
[05:53:37] <phper> what would this process be called exactly? so i can look it up elsewhere
[05:53:49] <Cork> <?php header('Content-Type: application/json'); ?> <-- important
[05:54:07] <Cork> phper: json over ajax possibly
[05:54:15] <Cork> "json api"
[05:54:39] <phper> alright
[05:54:44] <phper> thanks a lot for the help, guys
[05:55:24] <ExtraSteve> Cork: do you really have to set the content type?
[05:55:29] <Cork> yes
[05:55:29] <ExtraSteve> I don't think I've ever done that
[05:55:35] <Cork> else you will default to text/html
[05:55:40] <Cork> and that means the server lies
[05:55:57] <Cork> and that means jquery will think you send html and not json
[05:56:07] <ExtraSteve> huh
[05:56:16] <Cork> so you will have to do var json = JSON.parse(data); in the controller
[05:56:22] <Cork> sorry the callback
[05:56:35] <Cork> so yes the content-type is really important
[05:57:00] <Cork> the web doesn't have extensions, so the only way to know what the data is is by the content type header
[05:57:25] <Cork> it's like all files on you system removed there extensions
[05:57:32] <Cork> or all of them was .htm
[05:57:44] <ExtraSteve> no no, I understand that
[05:57:57] <ExtraSteve> I just didn't know you had to specify json
[05:58:03] <Cork> ExtraSteve: some frameworks checks for the use of json and sets the header for you
[05:58:06] <ExtraSteve> I've never done it before and I've never had to juse JSON.parse()
[05:58:18] <ExtraSteve> And I'm using just straight apache/php
[05:58:20] <Cork> but if you write pure php you must do this
[05:58:26] <ExtraSteve> Now I'm curious...
[05:59:16] <ExtraSteve> We are talking about response headers, right?
[05:59:20] <Cork> yes
[05:59:37] <ExtraSteve> Yeah, I just checked the last app I built using jquery/ajax
[05:59:38] <Cork> for a json request it should read Content-Type: application/json
[05:59:53] <ExtraSteve> text/html; charset=UTF-8
[05:59:56] <Cork> :)
[06:00:01] <Cork> ya, so the api lies
[06:00:14] <ExtraSteve> Well I'll be...
[06:00:24] <ExtraSteve> I suppose it's time to change that
[06:00:26] <Cork> only way to get jquery to handle that internally is to override the contenttype for the request
[06:00:44] <Cork> to say "no text/html is actually json"
[06:00:53] <ExtraSteve> Yeah, jquery still handles the response just fine, so I imagine that's what it's doing
[06:00:56] <Cork> i've had to do that, it isn't fun
[06:01:04] <Cork> (external api)
[06:01:16] <Cork> ExtraSteve: this doesn't happen automatically
[06:01:26] <ExtraSteve> Then how is my code working? :S
[06:01:54] <Cork> something you use somewhere expects to get the json as string
[06:02:13] <Cork> or rather expects to get json instead of a javascript object/array
[06:02:32] <Cork> ah, there is one other option
[06:02:54] <Cork> you could use $.getJSON it does the contentype override
[06:03:19] <Cork> the api is still broken, but ya, that would still let it work
[06:04:43] <Xatenev> is there a good book about js non browser?
[06:05:19] <Cork> non browser?
[06:05:22] <Cork> what do you mean?
[06:05:26] <Cork> nodejs?
[06:05:30] <Cork> mongodb?
[06:05:42] <Cork> emscripten?
[06:06:20] <ExtraSteve> Cork: I think I solved said mystery
[06:06:24] <Xatenev> ye nodejs for example, I dont rly find a good book on that
[06:06:38] <ExtraSteve> .autocomplete's response function is likely doing the dirty work for me
[06:06:42] <Cork> ?g get started on nodejs book
[06:06:43] <b-ot> Cork: The Node Beginner Book » A comprehensive Node.js tutorial → http://www.nodebeginner.org/
[06:06:49] <Xatenev> eloquentjavascript only has a short part about it
[06:06:52] <Cork> :)
[06:07:05] <ExtraSteve> Well, today I learned!
[06:07:31] <Cork> ExtraSteve: you use getJSON?
[06:07:33] <Cork> or what?
[06:07:51] <ExtraSteve> btw, I recommend learnyounode: http://nodeschool.io/ - though it's not a book
[06:08:06] <Cork> ya, i'm not a big on books either
[06:08:41] <ExtraSteve> Cork: the autocomplete function just takes in an ajax request with datatype jsonp
[06:08:55] <Cork> i have a pascal and c++ book from early 90's its about the last programming book i've bought
[06:09:07] <ExtraSteve> But it's got its own response handler, so I'm assuming that's what is making the text/html->application/json conversion
[06:09:13] <Cork> ExtraSteve: ah, jsonp is a completely different beast
[06:09:24] <Cork> as that is actually javascript and not json
[06:09:53] <ExtraSteve> Right - thus the "padding"
[06:10:20] <Cork> well it would expect it to be the data from a <script src> call
[06:10:23] <kongthap> hi, i like to separate .js files so it's simplier to maintain, i tried this http://pastie.org/9987336, it's error with message doSomething is not difined, what should i do if i like to have a set of global functions in a separate .js file? please hint
[06:10:37] <Cork> so ya, it shouldn't care about the content-type
[06:10:47] <Cork> as it isn't a xhr request
[06:11:08] <ExtraSteve> Makes sense
[06:11:23] <Cork> kongthap: function() {} creates a name scope
[06:11:34] <Cork> functions defined inside that can't be accessed outside
[06:12:07] <kongthap> Cork, my global functions should be outside function() {} ?
[06:12:16] <Cork> i would recommend doing something like window.myInternalAPIPrefix = { doSomething: function() { console.log('ok'); } }
[06:12:35] <Cork> and then you can access that from myInternalAPIPrefix.doSomething()
[06:12:47] <Cork> also there isn't a need to define the function in a $(function() {});
[06:12:58] <Cork> the code inside it isn't executed until you call it anyway
[06:13:12] <Cork> kongthap: yes and no
[06:13:21] <Cork> let me write a fiddle to show the structure i would recommend
[06:14:09] <kongthap> Cork, i'm still beginner so i just always wrap jquery functions inside $(function(){})
[06:14:41] <kongthap> i will try window.myInternalAPIPrefix first, then ask you some more questions :)
[06:15:51] <Cork> kongthap: http://jsfiddle.net/pcehx2bz/
[06:16:27] <kongthap> thanks, Cork
[06:16:43] <Cork> kongthap: to explain a bit window.<anything> becomes a global accessable name
[06:17:08] <Cork> in this code i create a global property "myAPI" and give it an object with one function (doSomething)
[06:17:37] <kongthap> Cork, awesome :)
[06:17:41] <Cork> so the only global scope pollution i cause is the one myAPI
[06:17:46] <Cork> i recommend a better name though :)
[06:18:19] <ExtraSteve> Is that how namespacing is typically done in js?
[06:18:25] <Cork> yes
[06:18:37] <ExtraSteve> Today I learned.. again
[06:18:37] <Cork> in es6 things gets much easier
[06:19:11] <Cork> { let a = 1; } console.log(a) == "ReferenceError: a is not defined"
[06:19:29] <Cork> { let a = 1; console.log(a) == 1 }
[06:19:45] <Cork> es6 js done right :)
[06:20:11] <kongthap> Cork, if i do that, when uglify all .js into one file would be ok, right?
[06:20:22] <Cork> kongthap: yes
[06:20:30] <Cork> don't use let though
[06:20:39] <Cork> it isn't web compatible yet :)
[06:21:13] <Cork> it's just me drooling over what you can do when you don't have to care about web compatibility (extensions for example)
[06:21:27] <kongthap> Cork, global variables can be done this way too? i meant, inside window.myApi
[06:21:47] <Xatenev> is a number in javascript rly an integer?
[06:21:51] <Xatenev> or is it a string aswell?
[06:21:52] <Cork> kongthap: yes that is the "right" way to do it
[06:21:59] <Cork> Xatenev: no
[06:22:03] <Cork> its a "Number"
[06:22:10] <Xatenev> so a self-defined type from JS
[06:22:11] <Xatenev> ?
[06:22:11] <Cork> and that in tern is basically a double float
[06:22:18] <Xatenev> ah ok
[06:22:26] <Xatenev> thanks :)
[06:22:31] <Cork> but with some machinery to make it behave more like an int
[06:22:36] <Cork> when no decimals is used
[06:22:38] <kongthap> Cork, thanks for showing me this light :P
[06:22:43] <Xatenev> so its just like a javascript-own type
[06:22:44] <Cork> :)
[06:22:46] <Xatenev> with some mixes of data types
[06:22:47] <Xatenev> :D
[06:22:56] <Cork> Xatenev: javascript is a type less language
[06:23:23] <Cork> typed arrays is coming and are introducing some strong types
[06:23:28] <Cork> but classical js doesn't have types
[06:23:43] <mooncup> fuck types
[06:23:53] <mooncup> imo things are simpler without
[06:24:04] <mooncup> if you're a good coder you shouldn't need forced types
[06:24:05] <Cork> eh, i have mixed feeling about it
[06:24:15] <Cork> there are good and bad points to both ends
[06:24:29] <mooncup> I guess having the ability to type-hint is good
[06:24:34] <mooncup> then you can make the choice
[06:24:44] <Cork> and to ensure you actually gave the correct data
[06:25:05] <Cork> but at the same time, type makes quite little sense in a scripting language
[06:25:09] <mooncup> but if you're parsing user input then you have to check your data whether or not it's typed
[06:25:19] <Cork> yup
[06:25:19] <mooncup> and if you're not parsing user input then why would the type be wrong?
[06:25:28] <Cork> yup again :)
[06:25:41] <Cork> like i said there is strong points to both sides
[06:25:45] <mooncup> yeah
[06:25:50] <mooncup> tis one of those things people will never agree on
[06:25:52] <Xatenev> is there anything like type hinting in JS though?
[06:25:52] <Xatenev> no or?^^
[06:26:05] <mooncup> not atm I don't think
[06:26:05] <Cork> no
[06:26:08] <mooncup> or if there is I've never used it
[06:26:10] <Xatenev> kk thought so
[06:26:18] <Cork> there are frameworks built ontop of js that does it though
[06:26:30] <Cork> like typescript (from ms)
[06:27:08] <Xatenev> Cork: would u say people shuld use typescript? or stay with plain JS ??^^
[06:27:27] <Cork> i see little point in typescript or coffiescript
[06:27:45] <Cork> and i quite strongly dislike them
[06:27:54] <Cork> coffiescript MUCH stronger then typescript
[06:28:13] <Cork> cause coffiescript just want to change the syntax and hide what happens
[06:28:19] <Cork> for little other gain
[06:28:22] <mooncup> coffeescript is like a js version of facebook's hack?
[06:28:33] <mooncup> oh
[06:28:33] <Cork> typescript actually adds something that might be useful
[06:28:48] <Cork> mooncup: no coffiescript is basically js without {}
[06:28:56] <mooncup> ...
[06:29:14] <mooncup> so you have to define any object you want to use?
[06:29:14] <Cork> and with implicit returns <-- i seriously HATE this
[06:29:41] <Cork> no
[06:30:01] <Cork> the ending code is basically the same just with a different syntax
[06:30:09] <ExtraSteve> The day people agree upon a typing is the day people agree upon a common code editor
[06:30:10] <mooncup> oh you mean without brackets
[06:30:12] <mooncup> sorry
[06:30:17] <Cork> ya
[06:30:18] <mooncup> I thought you meant without var x = {}
[06:30:22] <mooncup> that was p dumb of me
[06:30:55] <mooncup> also they wrote their compiler in coffeescript?
[06:31:01] <mooncup> does that mean they had to write the compiler twice?
[06:31:12] <Cork> var a = function() { console.log('hello'); } => a = () -> console.log 'hello'
[06:31:14] <ExtraSteve> And on the topic of code editors, what do y'all usually use for js/php/html/your-web-language-here?
[06:31:30] <mooncup> netbeans <3
[06:31:34] <Cork> mooncup: they are to quite some degree trying to make js look like ruby
[06:31:36] <mooncup> thought it does constantly annoy me
[06:31:43] <Xatenev> webstorm | phpstorm ExtraSteve
[06:31:53] <mooncup> Cork: meh I really don't understand these languages that compile to other ones
[06:31:56] <Xatenev> sometimes sublime @linux, not often though
[06:32:01] <mooncup> I can understand less/sass because css is evil
[06:32:11] <Xatenev> css isnt evil :P
[06:32:14] <mooncup> but anything else just seems like it was done for the sake of it
[06:32:16] <ExtraSteve> Xatenev: I hear good things about phpstorm, never uesd it myself though
[06:32:18] <Cork> mooncup: i do understand it for complex conversions like bytecode > js
[06:32:22] <Xatenev> its a GREAT ide imho
[06:32:28] <Xatenev> it helps me in almost all things :p^^
[06:32:29] <Cork> that lets you compile things like a desktop program to js
[06:32:35] <mooncup> yeah that sounds useful
[06:32:46] <Cork> but ya, for just "i don't want to write js" i don't agree at all
[06:32:58] <Cork> ya, emscripten does that
[06:33:00] <mooncup> though I'm disliking the trend of coding everything under the sun in js
[06:33:16] <Cork> its a llvm backend
[06:33:17] <ExtraSteve> Xatenev: does it handle git/svn and other source control software well?
[06:33:26] <Xatenev> yea there are a lot of plugins
[06:33:29] <Xatenev> just install the git plugin
[06:33:30] <Xatenev> or the svn plugin
[06:33:31] <Xatenev> :p
[06:33:36] <Xatenev> takes half a minute
[06:33:38] <mooncup> I know a lot of people who swear by sublime
[06:33:45] <mooncup> but it's more of a text editor than an ide
[06:33:48] <Xatenev> yea
[06:33:52] <Xatenev> mooncup: u have to do A LOT
[06:33:58] <Xatenev> to make it an ide^^
[06:34:00] <Cork> mooncup: well for some areas it actually fits, but ya i'm not a big fan of running js on the server
[06:34:06] <ExtraSteve> I'm on a mac and I typically use Coda
[06:34:06] <Xatenev> my sublime is configured like an IDE; but it took some time
[06:34:13] <Xatenev> i definetly prefer jetbrains IDE's over everything
[06:34:27] <ExtraSteve> But Coda makes you do most of the work - it's not an IDE at all
[06:34:34] <ExtraSteve> Just a fancy text editor
[06:34:41] <Cork> Xatenev: interesting, most users i've seen that has tried sublime are usually hooked :)
[06:34:46] <Cork> i sure am :)
[06:34:52] <Xatenev> hehe
[06:34:52] <Xatenev> not me
[06:34:53] <Xatenev> xd
[06:35:00] <Xatenev> I like full ide's
[06:35:03] <Cork> vim+sublime is all i need
[06:35:11] <ExtraSteve> holy smokes, phpstorm is pricy
[06:35:11] <Xatenev> Cork: are u using plugins
[06:35:13] <Xatenev> for ur sublime?
[06:35:18] <Cork> heh sure
[06:35:21] <Xatenev> kk :p
[06:35:24] <Xatenev> I know some ppl using vim only
[06:35:26] <Cork> and for vim
[06:35:27] <Xatenev> or VI :p
[06:35:42] <Cork> Xatenev: i don't get why anyone would use vi, it sucks sooo hard
[06:35:47] <ExtraSteve> For owrk, I pretty much have to use vim
[06:35:53] <Cork> but ya i used vim exclusively for a long time
[06:36:08] <ExtraSteve> It's pretty fast if you know what you're doing with it
[06:36:34] <ExtraSteve> And it's wonderful for editing files on your server instead of doing the upload/download/sync thing all the time
[06:36:38] <ExtraSteve> Especially with larger files
[06:36:43] <Cork> ya
[06:36:51] <Cork> that is basically what i use it for now days
[06:36:53] <Xatenev> I like full stack IDE's without me having to do anything
[06:36:55] <ExtraSteve> I can edit a 1gb file without having to download the thing
[06:36:55] <Xatenev> download and ready to go
[06:36:58] <Cork> if i need to access a file in a terminal
[06:37:02] <Xatenev> I dislike having to install plugins and stuff a lot
[06:37:06] <ExtraSteve> Cork: yep
[06:37:25] <ExtraSteve> And let's not forget it's wonderful regex capabilities
[06:37:28] <Cork> and ya, i feel lost if i need to edit a file in a terminal without vim :D
[06:37:41] <Cork> ExtraSteve: not a big fan of there regex though
[06:37:49] <ExtraSteve> No?
[06:37:54] <Cork> its the OOOLD regex type
[06:37:57] <ExtraSteve> Yeah
[06:38:00] <ExtraSteve> It takes some getting used to
[06:38:01] <Cork> and things are reveresed
[06:38:07] <Cork> so it always messes with my head
[06:38:36] <ExtraSteve> It gets more confusing if you're writing regex with it - switching back and forth all the time :p
[06:38:48] <Cork> "was it /txt ([0-9]+)/ or /txt \([0-9]+\)/ or /txt (\[0-9\]+)/ or /txt \(\[0-9\]+\)/...
[06:39:02] <ExtraSteve> hahahah
[06:39:06] <ExtraSteve> I play that game at least once a week
[06:39:08] <Cork> so i basically avoid regex in vim
[06:39:23] <Cork> i wish they had support for modern regex
[06:39:27] <Cork> would make life easier
[06:39:30] <ExtraSteve> Sometimes I get pissed enough that I just write a perl script because I *know* how regex works there
[06:39:39] <Cork> ya
[06:39:44] <ExtraSteve> Just a perl -e and away I go!
[06:40:51] <ExtraSteve> Or if I'm reformatting a file, I just use awk and sed
[06:41:03] <ExtraSteve> vim can be kinda clunky with certain things
[06:41:21] <ExtraSteve> I wonder if there's a way to make vim use modern regex
[06:42:00] <Cork> ya, but the multi edit in sublime beats that every time
[06:42:44] <Cork> so if possible i prefer to do refactoring in sublime cause then you can verify that it will do the correct thing
[06:42:50] <Cork> as you do it / before you do it
[06:42:58] <Cork> and that so damn powerful
[06:48:13] <dimi1947> are you aware of any plugin where someone can select time periods(for example....chose from 5:00 AM -to-7:00AM)...I want it for a schedulling application...I want the interface to be something lik this http://jsbin.com/gamuqo/2/
[06:48:35] <Cork> ?g jquery timepickers
[06:48:35] <b-ot> Cork: timepicker | jQuery Plugin Registry → http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/timepicker/
[06:48:50] <Cork> dimi1947: just check through the list there are several
[06:48:56] <Cork> ?g jquery timepicker range
[06:49:02] <b-ot> Cork: Kendo UI jQuery TimePicker Demo for selecting a time range → http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/timepicker/rangeselection
[06:51:42] <dimi1947> thanks I will Look at them...
[06:53:13] <Cork> dimi1947: btw by list i mean run that query through the search engine of your choice
[07:15:38] <dimi1947> as I said though I am searching something like interface shown in jsbin
[07:15:54] <dimi1947> I do not know if you saw it
[07:18:05] <dimi1947> I do not want the user selecting days of the month only time ranges from the days of the week...in other words picking the hours a store is open
[07:33:29] <adv_> why did they change css styles from jqm 1.3 to 1.4 ?
[07:36:06] <Narhir> I got stuck with using jQuery Waypoints plugin, my website basicaly is not getting the class change after reaching a waypint for "Anyonymouse" users.. funny enaugh it works for admin account :/ any ideas anyone ? http://79level.com/
[07:40:25] <finnnnnnnnnnn> I’m losing scope on a callback
[07:40:43] <finnnnnnnnnnn> is this right?
[07:40:44] <finnnnnnnnnnn>   d3.csv(file, function(dataset) {
[07:40:44] <finnnnnnnnnnn>      $.proxy( callback(dataset), self );
[07:40:45] <finnnnnnnnnnn>   });
[07:41:16] <finnnnnnnnnnn> where self  = this
[07:46:50] <shoky> finnnnnnnnnnn: d3.csv(file, callback.bind(self, dataset));    or:   d3.csv(file, $.proxy(callback, self));
[07:47:04] <shoky> whoops
[07:47:22] <shoky> finnnnnnnnnnn: d3.csv(file, callback.bind(self));    or:   d3.csv(file, $.proxy(callback, self));
[08:08:16] <chargen> Hi. I found this fiddle that lets me track the mouse movement while dragging but would it be possible to drag the bookmarklet also with the drag?
[08:08:19] <chargen> http://jsfiddle.net/GZpHP/1/
[08:09:38] <chargen> I know it can track the movement because it disable mousedown event but I need it to grab the element.
[08:27:00] <Forbidd3n> Has anyone heard of or familiar with why drag and drop to uplaod file doesn't work in windows 7
[08:34:13] <coby> When I tried that the dress turned gold and white for some reason
[08:35:45] <coby> Forbidd3n, jk but I am using window 7 and use drag and drop with firefox and chrome all the time. Sometimes it gives issues if I try to do it across multiple screens though (sine I use my laptop and a secondary screen right next to it).
[08:38:47] <coby> chargen, that's a neat fiddle. I don't see why it wouldn't be possible. Not sure how to do it though. I would think some code to make that element id "dragthis" match the mouse coordinates would work.
[08:39:35] <Forbidd3n> coby: the files are not being posted at all back to the server
[08:41:50] <chargen> coby: That's kind of what I'm trying I think. I add an image that is a copy of the img I want to drag to follow the mouse cursor. However I still need to be able to drag&drop to pass the data from drag to drop points.
[08:43:27] <_DB> sup guys quick question
[08:43:28] <_DB> what color is this dress http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Untitled-12.jpg
[08:43:30] <_DB> XD
[08:44:06] <chargen> _DB: which of the 3?
[08:44:35] <Arhitso> hello guys!!
[08:45:00] <Arhitso> how can I show only the years dropdown with datepicker
[08:45:03] <chargen> coby: Can you help me please?
[08:45:32] <_DB> its the same dress
[08:45:38] <_DB> they just fixed teh bad lighting
[08:49:36] <EGreg> hey I have a serious q
[08:50:06] <EGreg> var a = $('<div />').append(some big html)     ; // is this a documentFragment?
[08:50:24] <EGreg> a.appendTo('#page') ; // once I append to the DOM, is the whole thing appended like a documentFragment?
[08:50:42] <EGreg> ejohn wrote abotu document fragments back in 2008: http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/
[08:50:42] <coby> chargen, I am not a java savy guy. I mean, I copy and paste stuff from stack overflow and codepen.io and sometimes I tweak basic names / variables but that's it. I think you should find some drag and drop stuff on www.codepen.io stackoverflow and jsfiddle and then see if you can combine the code.
[08:50:54] <EGreg> so does jQuery use them now? is it super fast to do the above code?
[08:51:48] <EGreg> So if I want to create, say, a huge amount of list items, but programmatically, I should do it BEFORE putting it in the dom, right? And then put only one element in the DOM?
[08:53:59] <coby> EGreg, that is a very interesting article there
[08:54:11] <EGreg> thanks.
[08:54:17] <EGreg> also this http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/adv-talk/
[08:54:35] <EGreg> but it seems from this that every time I do $(some html) it actually uses the DOM to createElement first and THEN makes a createFragment
[08:56:30] <chargen> coby: Thanks for the links. I just do the same thing, browse all the time stackoverflow :)
[08:56:36] <coby> hmmm. Can you see it when the page is loading?
[08:56:44] <chargen> That fiddle come from there
[08:57:06] <coby> chargen, oh yeah you're welcome. www.codepen.io is a goldmine
[08:58:03] <coby> EGreg, so if I gather this correctly, you want to improve page load performance for pages with a long list of content?
[08:58:32] <coby> oh and THANK you for that extra link
[08:58:35] <EGreg> yes
[08:58:51] <EGreg> you're welcome :)
[08:59:31] <coby> Sweet. Yeah I think that's really interesting. Does Facebook use that for their content to load in chunks as you scroll?
[09:00:04] <EGreg> I believe they use React for some of their apps
[09:00:21] <EGreg> as for infinite scroll, that's something else. you probably want this:
[09:00:38] <robertmaxrees> facebook made react, so I’d hope they’re using it ;)
[09:00:51] <coby> honestly, I had to look up the term "DOM". Shows what I know.
[09:01:46] <EGreg> https://plus.google.com/+PaulIrish/posts/Ee53Gg6VCck
[09:06:54] <coby> EGreg, nice. I +1 that for sure.
[09:08:28] <coby> EGreg, so that's the question now: Does JQuery use documen fragments?
[09:08:34] <EGreg> yes
[09:09:25] <coby> EGreg, saw this bit: http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/adv-talk/#5
[09:10:27] <coby> It's the same article you sent me though, isn't it?
[09:13:47] <EGreg> yes it is
[09:13:49] <EGreg> lol
[09:14:11] <coby> lol did it help answer that question though or lead to more questions?
[09:15:55] <EGreg> it led to the question of how I am supposed to create a documentFragment with many copies of an element before inserting it into the dom
[09:16:23] <robertmaxrees> like you do any other element.
[09:17:08] <coby> I'd like to know too
[09:17:22] <robertmaxrees> if you’re using jquery, var $someDiv = $(‘<div>’); <-- this creates an element that you can .append() to, etc.
[09:17:22] <EGreg> what do you mean
[09:17:25] <EGreg> can you give me an example
[09:17:35] <robertmaxrees> just did ;)
[09:17:55] <EGreg> Say I render some html into a document fragment, with $('<blablablabla>'). Was the dom used?
[09:17:59] <Duvdevan> $('div'); // <!--- gets an element(s)
[09:18:11] <robertmaxrees> EGreg yes.
[09:18:13] <EGreg> But now let's say that HTML is a template that I want to repeat 100 times, before inserting them into the dom. Like ng:repeat initial rendering.
[09:18:35] <EGreg> In regular JS I would do this:
[09:18:44] <robertmaxrees> EGreg you’re conflating things - “the DOM” is just an API.
[09:18:50] <robertmaxrees> it includes document fragments.
[09:19:07] <robertmaxrees> document fragments are like any other node in the visible DOM, they’re just partials that don’t get rendered.
[09:19:23] <robertmaxrees> in other words, they’re detatched from the visible document.
[09:19:29] <robertmaxrees> but they behave like they rest of the dom.
[09:20:31] <EGreg> var template = document.createElement('div'), container = document.createElement('div'); for (var i=0; i<100; ++i) { container.appendChild(template.clone()); } document.getElementById('page').appendChild(container);
[09:20:45] <EGreg> that would only cause one repaint, and would be the fastest way, right?
[09:20:51] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[09:21:08] <EGreg> so why would I use document fragments, when I can just create elements that aren't in the DOM?
[09:21:25] <EGreg> in other words why use createDocumentFragment instead of createElement?
[09:22:41] <EGreg> aha http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3397161/should-i-use-document-createdocumentfragment-or-document-createelement
[09:22:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:23:36] <EGreg> it seems pretty much the same. It's not like some special class of thing
[09:23:44] <robertmaxrees> just a little more convenient imo.
[09:23:52] <robertmaxrees> or you can use jquery’s version and call it a day.
[09:24:00] <EGreg> So, createElement will just create a container that you can insert into the DOM, and createDocumentFragment creates something whose CONTENTS you can append all at once.
[09:24:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:24:24] <EGreg> Got it :)
[09:24:27] <EGreg> Thanks man!
[09:24:58] <EGreg> So now the question is what does jQuery do?
[09:25:11] <robertmaxrees> why does it matter? ;)
[09:25:17] <EGreg> $('<div />') uses createElement to create the div, but then also creates a documentFragment to hold it?
[09:25:33] <EGreg> Well, because I want to clone a template 100x and insert them all into the dom at once
[09:25:47] <EGreg> And I want to understand how to do that with jQuery
[09:25:49] <robertmaxrees> you can do that pretty easily in jquery.
[09:26:05] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[09:26:06] <EGreg> I just use jQuery's .clone() which can copy data and events
[09:26:09] <EGreg> sure
[09:27:13] <coby> This is getting good
[09:27:16] <coby> :D
[09:28:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o9ton6sb/
[09:33:10] <coby> robertmaxrees, I thought I broke it when I made i > 49050 but after its hickup it loaded a list that appears to be only several hundred foo's long.
[09:33:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:33:49] <coby> I wonder, did jsfiddle set a limit or is it a limit standard in jquery? Because I didn't see all 49050 foo's
[09:33:59] <robertmaxrees> there’s a limit to what your browser can handle.
[09:35:11] <coby> oh man... and of all browsers I have IE open because X-Chat defaults it so it was open from the links I clicked XD
[09:35:32] <robertmaxrees> ie11 is actually better about some of that stuff than other browsers.
[09:35:45] <coby> *Breaks out Google Chrome* >:D Let's see what this baby can do
[09:36:02] <robertmaxrees> IE11 does things like basic for loops faster than most other browsers fwiw.
[09:38:46] <coby> Nice. I was deceived by the scrollbar size. When I copy and paste the foos, Google Chrome has handled up to 30080 (with some lag) so far. I checked it in my code pad, and all 30080 lines of foo's are there.
[09:42:11] <robertmaxrees> just keep in mind that you should never actually do something like that ;)
[09:52:56] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody have any opinions specifically on the jQuery-UI widget factory? Not the widgets that come packaged with jQ-UI. Just started using it and it's quite a bit better than I expected.
[09:55:04] <coby> robertmaxrees, so that jsfiddle is just a fun example an not practical? Or you mean I should never actually do 30,000 + ?
[09:55:51] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy we do that here.
[09:56:00] <robertmaxrees> though were moving away from it.
[09:56:09] <robertmaxrees> coby both i guess?
[09:56:15] <robertmaxrees> *we’re
[09:57:02] <coby> Aww well what SHOULD be used practically?
[09:57:07] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Yeah, we're using it because most of the people on our team are extremely back-end heavy and we found the jQ-UI widget factory to be pretty damn simple. It doesn't seem all that amazing but it's a nice and simple way to modularize our UI components.
[09:57:13] <robertmaxrees> coby i mean the for loop part.
[09:57:19] <robertmaxrees> the cloning/appending whatever is legit.
[09:57:36] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy yeah, lots of people like it for that reason.
[09:58:45] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: You know of anything better? It's literally the only thing I've ever wanted to use form jQuery-UI lol. It also doesn't seem ALL that fantastic.
[09:58:59] <robertmaxrees> lol I know why you’re saying that ;)
[09:59:28] <robertmaxrees> if it works for you, great!  we abuse backbone views here to handle a lot of what people tend to use the jquery widget factor for.
[10:00:06] <DeltaHeavy> Cool cool
[10:00:36] <DeltaHeavy> Usually I don't use any sort of library for modules. I use stuff like Browserify but that's about it.
[10:01:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we’re figuring that stuff out right now.  we’re using bower for our frontend deps in one of our platforms right now, but that’s probably going to change.
[10:02:37] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, can't use anything fancy like that here though I use it in all my personal projects. Not even using a CSS pre-processor.
[10:02:45] <robertmaxrees> woah
[10:02:49] <robertmaxrees> even WE use one.
[10:03:59] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, everybody but one other person in my team are C#.NET guys who "know HTML/CSS and JS" but aren't even close to being a proper front-end dev. Rather frustrating.
[10:04:14] <robertmaxrees> i worked at a place like that for a long time.
[10:05:43] <DeltaHeavy> This is my first non-amateur job and it kinda seems like the hiring process is pretty shitty. A webdev is a webdev is a webdev seems to be how they view it though IMO, somebody who programs C#.NET all day long FOR websites isn't even a webdev IMO.
[10:05:55] <DeltaHeavy> No difference between that and making a JSON API for a mobile app.
[10:06:16] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy they might be a webdev, just a different kind.
[10:06:46] <DeltaHeavy> IMO a webdev develops for the web platform. The web platform is HTML+CSS+JS.
[10:06:54] <DeltaHeavy> It's the client-side of things.
[10:06:58] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[10:07:13] <DeltaHeavy> Though I understand back-end devs are still commonly refered to as webdevs if the software they're writing is for a website.
[10:07:26] <robertmaxrees> we term everybody here a “software developer” and move away from the pedantry.
[10:07:29] <DeltaHeavy> It's kind of like if I made the back-end for an Android app, am I an Android dev?
[10:08:12] <robertmaxrees> it depends - there are some special considerations our backend guys have to make here that you wouldn’t necessarily be concerned with in a non web environment.
[10:08:32] <DeltaHeavy> Well it's important when you need people who can do HTML/CSS and JS. We have like 5 guys who are excellent C#.NET programmers and 2 guys including myself who are front-end, and this is almost entirely a front-end project.
[10:08:50] <DeltaHeavy> And yeah, I can agree with that but those sorts of things really aren't a big part of it AFAIK.
[10:09:04] <robertmaxrees> even when you’re working just in your backend platform.  and they can be tremendous parts of the day-to-day.
[10:09:20] <DeltaHeavy> Like what?
[10:10:19] <robertmaxrees> in our case, they have to be mindful about serving lots of clients small bits of data, instead of long, persistent connections.  they have to know how/what/when to cache based on end user behavior and frontend practices.
[10:11:08] <robertmaxrees> they can’t operate in a silo of “this is the platform” - they need to be aware of the needs of the frontend.  out backend guys regular monitor end-to-end performance to look for places we can do stuff better.
[10:11:18] <robertmaxrees> *regularly
[10:11:36] <DeltaHeavy> What kinds of data? Sounds like something any sort of back-end software may have to deal with.
[10:11:42] <robertmaxrees> we do ecommerce.
[10:12:12] <robertmaxrees> so product data, searches, CMS-style content, etc.
[10:12:59] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, e-commerce is a beast on its own and your'e unlikely to find native apps for that. That said I'd say that's more "e-commerce" specific than something specific to the web platform.
[10:13:28] <robertmaxrees> hell, even at my last place our backend guys spent a lot of time trying to understand what the frontend needed so they could serve those needs.
[10:14:19] <DeltaHeavy> That's non-specific to web though too. The back-end needs to understand the needs of the front-end and visa-versa.
[10:14:37] <robertmaxrees> sure - i’m arguing that the web can have special considerations and pecularities to it.
[10:14:42] <robertmaxrees> you’re fine to disagree ;)
[10:14:55] <DeltaHeavy> Only thing I can honestly see being different about back-end web stuff compared to other back-end stuff is templating.
[10:15:05] <robertmaxrees> our backend guys don’t touch templating at all.
[10:15:05] <DeltaHeavy> And I respect your opinion ;D
[10:15:14] <DeltaHeavy> Assembling the templates?
[10:15:17] <DeltaHeavy> I'm not talking about writing them
[10:15:21] <robertmaxrees> they don’t do that.
[10:15:33] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, I guess that would still be front-end.
[10:15:58] <DeltaHeavy> Like, if your e-commerce site was an e-commerce Android app, what would be different for the back-end guys?
[10:16:13] <DeltaHeavy> Like, it was EXACTLY the same, but a native app.
[10:16:48] <robertmaxrees> we would never release that, but we might consider how to cache more things on the client side maybe?
[10:17:13] <robertmaxrees> though android apps tend to be glorified webviews most of the time.
[10:17:51] <DeltaHeavy> An Android app that's a glorified webview is still a web app.
[10:17:56] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[10:18:02] <robertmaxrees> so the distinction would be blurry.
[10:18:08] <DeltaHeavy> I'm talking about a native one.
[10:18:34] <DeltaHeavy> Eh, IMO making something with PhoneGap or Apache Codorva is making a web app, regardless if you access it through a traditional web browser or not.
[10:18:35] <robertmaxrees> eh, i’m thinking more compared against other industries - the needs of a place that does, say, hospital management software is going to have different concerns than an ecommerce company.
[10:19:16] <notchris> If I have an anchor inside of a div, how do I reference the div on that anchors click function?
[10:19:26] <notchris> So really, how do I reference a parent element
[10:19:30] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest(‘div’);, notchris
[10:19:32] <robertmaxrees> or .parent();
[10:19:49] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I owe you like 10 beers now at least
[10:19:53] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:19:53] <DeltaHeavy> Agree'd, I'm just using this as an example as it highlights my points. Only difference I'd see is the assets having to be loaded onto client on load rather than on install but that's just a tiny little thing.
[10:20:15] <robertmaxrees> i don’t think that’s really enough of a difference, but i see what you’re tyring to say.
[10:20:50] <randomguy> is there a way to do a find or filter based on a prop value?
[10:21:09] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, this is why I think back-end "webdevs" aren't really webdevs at all, not that it's anything to be viewed negatively. Not making that distinction is really fucking up where I work lol.
[10:21:14] <DeltaHeavy> And I doubt they'll learn.
[10:21:21] <robertmaxrees> randomguy yep - .filter(function() { return $(this).prop(‘foo’) === ‘bar’ });
[10:21:27] <notchris> If I have a variable in php, can I use it inside of a script?
[10:21:29] <notchris> Like in example
[10:21:36] <randomguy> nice, ty
[10:21:50] <DeltaHeavy> Just like how when I was making RESTful JSON APIs for iOS/Android apps, I wasn't doing iOS/Android app development.
[10:21:56] <notchris> $(‘.test’).text(‘<?php echo “test”;?>’);
[10:21:59] <robertmaxrees> notchris you have to write it out as JS in a script tag or into a js file.
[10:22:06] <robertmaxrees> don’t generate code though.
[10:22:25] <notchris> Ahh
[10:22:43] <robertmaxrees> notchris generate data, but never code.  that’s a great way to screw yourself over later.
[10:22:53] <notchris> Thank you robertmaxrees
[10:22:57] <robertmaxrees> fsh
[10:22:59] <robertmaxrees> *fsho
[10:24:03] <notchris> OK one last one
[10:24:16] <notchris> I’m going to echo the php variable inside of the links data attr
[10:24:27] <notchris> data-title="<?php the_field('event_name'); ?>"
[10:24:35] <notchris> Than I can call .data
[10:24:41] <notchris> in jquery to get the variable
[10:24:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[10:24:45] <notchris> Nice!
[10:24:50] <notchris> :D
[10:25:04] <notchris> So in that instance I would do
[10:25:12] <notchris> .data(‘title’);
[10:25:20] <robertmaxrees> a-hyup
[10:25:29] <notchris> robertmaxrees: See? I’m learning!
[10:25:33] <robertmaxrees> boom
[10:25:39] <notchris> :)
[10:27:19] <Sal> is there a way to select divs that have bottom > 0 ?
[10:27:37] <Sal> or do i need to create a loop?
[10:27:42] <robertmaxrees> “bottom > 0”?
[10:27:45] <robertmaxrees> you can use .filter()
[10:28:04] <Sal> never used that
[10:28:07] <Sal> let me check it
[10:28:17] <Sal> its applied after the query?
[10:29:44] <Sal> robertmaxrees, is it filter with function?
[10:33:49] <robertmaxrees> yes
[10:33:59] <robertmaxrees> $(‘div’).filter(function() {});
[10:40:37] <Sal> thanks
[10:42:44] <dn5> textarea does not have val attribute, how am I suppose to change the value without using .val()?
[10:43:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pwo2f0ag/
[10:43:55] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[10:45:24] <dn5> robertmaxrees: then I did something worng
[10:46:06] <dn5> ah.. I know whats wrong, I have quotes inside the string
[10:50:05] <dn5> fixed with addslashes() from php
[10:55:03] <MikeD_> is the internal implementation of .appendChild() a known performance-killer of jquery "doing stuff" ?
[10:56:56] <robertmaxrees> huh
[10:56:58] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:57:37] <MikeD_> i just happened to click "start profiling" in IE debugger... after about a minute I turned it off and a whole spew of function name and count and times were displayed
[10:57:46] <MikeD_> top offender seems to be appendChild
[10:58:02] <robertmaxrees> appendChild can trigger document reflows, repaints, and all other sorts of nasty stuff if you’re not careful.
[10:58:17] <MikeD_> i think that's what's happening then
[10:58:19] <Lencl> I have a bunch of <li> elements. I have $currentObject = $(this); everytime the element is clicked. When they click, I wanna check if it was the same element they clicked so I do if($this ===$currentObj)
[10:58:35] <Lencl> but it's coming out false everytime, is object different every time?
[10:58:37] <robertmaxrees> Lencl that... doesn’t make sense.
[10:58:51] <Lencl> one sec, I'll put it up on jsfiddle
[10:58:54] <robertmaxrees> thanks.
[10:59:09] <MikeD_> i think i know what that means, but i'll wait for the fiddle
[10:59:46] <robertmaxrees> i got lost with the “when they click, i wanna check if it was the same element they clicked” lol
[11:00:01] <MikeD_> if the new click is the same as the old click
[11:00:46] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z7kjzdqm/ fwiw
[11:04:03] <Lencl> http://jsfiddle.net/bxb4kcqk/5/
[11:04:28] <Lencl> MikeD_:  was right
[11:09:15] <ajf-> Alright right now I'm in QUITE a pickle. http://jsfiddle.net/q7kex60d/1/. I've namespaced all my click events, and they should be triggering and detaching correctly. The first buttons work though, but when it's a child panel (after clicking on 'Topic'), the buttons on that panel don't toggle correctly (they all stay active at the same time)
[11:09:23] <ajf-> and I've gotten myself quite confused with this
[11:09:33] <ajf-> can any good soul help out ?
[11:16:00] <ajf-> I'll clean up that code a bit
[11:18:47] <robertmaxrees> Lencl yeah complex equality is kind of a pain.
[11:19:24] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you need to find some other way to uniquely identify them
[11:19:43] <Lencl> ah
[11:19:56] <Lencl> okay I'll think of something, thanks
[11:19:57] <robertmaxrees> what’s your end goal here?
[11:20:26] <Lencl> to make sure they don't reclick the last element they clicked
[11:20:44] <robertmaxrees> why?  like, what are you building?
[11:21:36] <Lencl> it's quiz matching. If they click on one word... they have to click on a definition and won't let them choose another word until they pick the definition
[11:21:59] <Lencl> but if they click on that same word, then it will cancel and won't require a definition
[11:22:25] <robertmaxrees> so why not set a data-hasbeenselected when they click one and check that data attribute instead?
[11:22:41] <Lencl> ah good idea
[11:22:55] <Lencl> okay will do that  thank you :D
[11:25:28] <ajf-> Okay here we go: http://jsfiddle.net/7Lo86hy2/. With explanations inside =)
[11:40:04] <ajf-> any help appreciated thanks
[11:40:28] <Guddu> Using jquery i want to find the value of the input field that has name = 'quantity' will this code work?
[11:40:29] <Guddu> var $input = $('#'+id).find('input.quantity');
[11:40:55] <robertmaxrees> Guddu that’ll find inputs with that classname
[11:41:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to use an attribute selector.
[11:41:58] <Guddu> Thanks robertmaxrees
[11:46:25] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, Something like this should work?
[11:46:34] <Guddu> $('#1').find([name='quantity']);Its not returning anything though
[11:46:46] <robertmaxrees> $('#1').find(“[name='quantity']”);
[11:47:16] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, In that I need to search only for input elements
[11:47:28] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[11:48:05] <robertmaxrees> that’ll find all elements with that attribute that are children of #1
[11:48:15] <Guddu> Elements of Type Input with Name Quantity
[11:48:19] <Guddu> I will try to write something
[11:48:32] <Guddu> $('#1').find("input[name='quantity']").val()
[11:48:34] <robertmaxrees> then slap input in front of the first [
[11:48:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can do that.
[11:48:43] <Guddu> Thanks robertmaxrees
[11:48:48] <robertmaxrees> though you should need the input part.
[11:48:51] <robertmaxrees> *shouldn’t
[12:12:41] <AdNauseaum> can you guys help with a jquery plugin i can't get to work
[12:13:14] <AdNauseaum> someone elses? i dont know js im just trying to get this plugin to work
[12:15:55] <adv_> i have class="btncustom" but when the page gets rendered it becomes class="btncustom ui-btn ui-btn-d", which overrides my btncustom stuff. how can i get something like class="ui-btn ui-btn-d btncustom" ?
[12:18:12] <AdNauseaum> =/
[12:19:06] <samssh> adv_, The order the classes are in the attribute doesn't affect the cascade. You would either need to remove the other classes, or make your properties applied to btncustom use a more specific selector.
[12:19:30] <adv_> samssh: ah. example?
[12:20:05] <adv_> for the latter
[12:20:16] <AdNauseaum> can you guys help with a jquery plugin i can't get to work? it's not my plugin i'm just trying to implement it but i can't figure out what i'm doing wrong. halp
[12:20:18] <samssh> Perhaps instead of .btncustom {}, you might use div.btncustom {}, or .parentclass .btncustom {}
[12:21:30] <samssh> Sorry AdNauseaum, I can't really help with a Jquery plugin, I'm a noob with them myself. You might be able to get an answer if you give some more details about the problem.
[12:22:31] <ajf-> no ?
[12:22:38] <ajf-> Any tips here?: http://jsfiddle.net/7Lo86hy2/. With explanations inside =)

[13:12:06] <in_deep_thought> I want to post a token in a script to my server. so I use $.post(token, function(token){ //what goes in here? })
[13:12:25] <in_deep_thought> 2 questions: 1 what goes in there? and 2, how can I access this object on the server?
[13:12:45] <jphase> in_deep_thought: no, "token" in that is where the url you post to goes, and the function is replaced with the object you want to post
[13:13:24] <in_deep_thought> so $.post(“url on server”, token)
[13:13:30] <jphase> $.post( 'http://yoursite.com/post_url', { token: '8675309' }, function(response) { // do something with the response });
[13:13:30] <in_deep_thought> no callback involved?
[13:13:42] <jphase> read up on .post
[13:13:55] <in_deep_thought> I don’t need to do anything whith my response. can I just leave that part blank?
[13:14:00] <jphase> you can
[13:14:33] <in_deep_thought> and what does the object look like on my server? is it a request object?
[13:14:57] <jphase> it's in $_POST and $_REQUEST in PHP, yes
[13:15:15] <jphase> or whatever scripting language you use
[13:15:22] <in_deep_thought> what about python?
[13:15:35] <jphase> that classifies as "whatever scripting language" ;)
[13:15:41] <jphase> works the same in all, just syntax is different
[13:16:00] <in_deep_thought> so just request it seems
[13:16:25] <jphase> request.POST yes
[13:16:42] <in_deep_thought> ah ok
[13:17:15] <jphase> you can also use request.params['token'] or whatever as well, but it's typically recommended to use the specific POST end point because that's what you're doing... posting
[13:18:02] <in_deep_thought> so it would specifically be request.POST[‘token’] because thats in the dict object
[13:18:34] <jphase> in_deep_thought: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/464040/how-are-post-and-get-variables-handled-in-python#answer-464977

[13:20:21] <_DB> <input type="text" required="required" class="form-control input-sm" name="zip"  value="{{$user->billing_zip}}">
[13:20:48] <_DB> does it need a id for required to work?
[13:32:12] <DelphiWorld> yo queryers
[13:32:24] <DelphiWorld> is there a way to include a js file from inside of another js file?
[13:32:45] <jphase> DelphiWorld: you create a DOM node (a script tag) with the src attribute pointing to another js file
[13:33:01] <DelphiWorld> jphase: any snip please?
[13:33:55] <jphase> $('<script src="path/to/your/file.js">').appendTo('body');
[13:34:12] <jphase> is one example... if you're trying to make that available in the script you're appending from, that probably won't work though FYI
[13:34:15] <DelphiWorld> jphase: new for me
[13:35:05] <DelphiWorld> jphase: i have jphase.js but i want it to be called from DelphiWorld.js, but DelphiWorld will be embedded from my html
[13:36:11] <jphase> DelphiWorld: you perhaps want to look into .getScript() then
[13:36:21] <jphase> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[13:36:22] <DelphiWorld> jphase: okay
[13:50:11] <testerbit> Can a ternary operator be used to modify .html like so: http://pastebin.com/4x92e4EV
[13:50:12] <testerbit> ?
[13:50:22] <robertmaxrees> yep
[13:51:07] <testerbit> does not seem to work
[13:51:17] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:51:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mbc9a7o9/
[13:51:56] <testerbit> or would one have to use a ternary with two jQuery?
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> “with two jquery” huh?
[13:52:26] <robertmaxrees> (row_data[12] || row_data[13]) == (0 || null) this very likely isn’t doing what you think it is.
[13:52:58] <testerbit> probably
[13:53:12] <robertmaxrees> what are you tyring to do?
[13:53:14] <robertmaxrees> *trying
[13:54:17] <testerbit> if row_data[12] OR row_data[13] EQUALS 0 or null
[13:54:47] <robertmaxrees> then just do !(row_data[12] || row_data[13])
[13:54:48] <testerbit> then output: "Edit Transaction"
[13:54:55] <robertmaxrees> since 0 and null are both falsy values
[13:55:20] <testerbit> good idea
[13:56:09] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you’d have to do row_data[12] === 0 || row_data[12] == null || row_data[13] === 0 || row_data[13] == null
[13:57:59] <adv_> how do i get the width of a div obj ?
[13:58:13] <robertmaxrees> .width()
[14:01:22] <adv_> and how can i dynamically set an obj width to that .width()/
[14:01:23] <adv_> ?
[14:01:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:01:35] <mbrzuzy> $(obj).width($(div).width())
[14:01:38] <mbrzuzy> :D
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:01:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[14:01:44] <mbrzuzy> lol
[14:01:51] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend i guess.

[14:10:29] <robertmaxrees> Jamesonwa not the right place.
[14:12:51] <Guddu> Will this method get called each time any element with the name quantity gets changed?
[14:12:52] <Guddu> $("input[name='quantity']").change(function()
[14:13:08] <robertmaxrees> any that exist at time of binding, yes.
[14:13:21] <robertmaxrees> *any input with that name, rather.
[14:13:53] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, Somehow it is not getting called. Ia m just doing a alert inside the function. What could be the issue? Do i need to move it to document.ready?
[14:14:09] <robertmaxrees> is your code in <head>?
[14:15:00] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, Its inside <script> and within <body>
[14:15:12] <robertmaxrees> is it before or after the input?
[14:16:12] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, Before. The input itself is something that gets constructued dynamically with jquery as user interacts with the screen.
[14:16:27] <robertmaxrees> ah, in that case you need event delegation.
[14:16:40] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:17:17] <Jamesonwa> Sorry thought it was bitcoin-otc
[14:17:18] <Jamesonwa> my bad
[14:18:27] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, So something like this instead?
[14:18:27] <Guddu> $("input[name='quantity']").on("change", function()
[14:18:34] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:18:54] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on(‘change’, “input[name='quantity']", function() {});
[14:19:04] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain it.
[14:21:03] <Guddu> Thanks robertmaxrees
[15:29:12] <in_deep_thought> can I get some advice on this: http://jsbin.com/relamiqeru/1/ as you can see I am trying to fill my div with html if the proper coupon code “idh4” is used.
[15:29:42] <robertmaxrees> .val() === ‘idh4’
[15:31:15] <in_deep_thought> robertmaxrees: ok I changed that. still doesn’t seem to fill. I feel like that if statement is only getting called when the page is first loaded so even if the val is idh4 later on, it doesn’t check it again
[15:34:34] <in_deep_thought> does that sound reasonable or is there a different issue?
[15:42:36] <in_deep_thought> p.s. any one know how I can get an invite to the #javascript channel?
[15:48:15] <in_deep_thought> ah ha, its tricky I see
[15:48:23] <wontoner> in_deep_thought: try ##javascript
[15:48:57] <in_deep_thought> wontoner: ohh thanks
[15:50:14] <wontoner> no problem
[15:52:00] <Lencl> how exactly does ajax works when you post as json?
[15:52:25] <Lencl> in firebug, it shows I'm posting this: Source: data=%7B%226661%22%3A6663%7D
[15:52:32] <Lencl> how is that interpreted in PHP?
[17:16:44] <Guddu> I have a code that checks if(e.keyCode == 13) and if true then returns false. What could it be for?
[17:20:59] <robertmaxrees> return false; causes e.preventDefault(); and e.stopPropagation(); for event handlers iirc.
[17:22:28] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, Thanks. When i use event delegation then is $(this) available?
[17:22:30] <Guddu> My code is http://dpaste.com/2XT1MQ2
[17:22:41] <Guddu> What i am trying to do is to check if the input field is empty or not.
[17:22:44] <robertmaxrees> .value isn’t what you think it is.
[17:22:47] <robertmaxrees> you want .val()
[17:23:08] <robertmaxrees> if ($(this).val()) {}
[17:23:15] <robertmaxrees> no need to check === or anything.
[17:23:57] <Guddu> Thanks robertmaxrees
[17:24:04] <robertmaxrees> empty strings are falsy.
[17:33:37] <tomasm-> hi, is there a systematic way via jquery to find out whether the screen is on a desktop, a tablet, smartphone, etc using media queries? I am trying to implement some sliding sidebars and want different default behavior depending if it's mobile or not.... http://plugins.adchsm.me/slidebars/usage.php
[17:47:14] <doug16k> Uhkis, hi
[17:47:17] <doug16k> you here?
[17:47:43] <doug16k> remember that monitor calibration tons-of-colored-divs thing? that laggy body background change is a mystery
[17:48:00] <doug16k> it only happens in firefox
[17:48:18] <doug16k> as if it is debouncing/batching the css changes
[17:48:32] <doug16k> on the other hand, that page causes chrome to screw up!
[17:50:20] <doug16k> http://www.jstraight.com/1219/6/show
[17:50:41] <doug16k> when the mouseover changes the body background it doesnt invalidate the correct area of the screen
[17:50:55] <doug16k> !
[17:51:21] <rbo> evening :)
[17:52:57] <doug16k> you may have to scroll down a bit to provoke it to render incorrectly
[17:53:10] <doug16k> (chrome)
[17:53:40] <doug16k> in firefox it draws perfectly, but the color change is laggy
[17:54:29] <doug16k> it is 16 divs, each containing 256 divs, total of 4096 + 16 divs
[17:54:39] <doug16k> all floating left :)
[17:57:13] <rbo> pretty damn cool xD
[17:57:32] <rbo> thats a ton of divs though
[17:57:40] <rbo> brb I need to get a pack of smokes.
[18:22:04] <Lencl> hmm
[18:22:46] <Lencl> if I have bunch of elements like <li data-param1="brown"></li><li data-param1="green"></li><li data-param1="blue"></li>
[18:22:54] <Lencl> is there a way to rearrange them using jquery?
[18:23:09] <Lencl> like, I want the blue first then the brown, etc.
[19:12:12] <rbo> does anyone use atom.io IDE?
[19:13:22] <rbo> or just "text editor"
[19:13:40] <neanderslob> hi all, I'm starting to work on an auto-completion system for a series of form fields and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations to prevent me from reinventing the wheel
[19:13:52] <neanderslob> the aim of the system is described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28777523/jquery-autofill-repeated-form-fields
[19:15:21] <neanderslob> I'm certainly up for just rolling up my sleeves and writing the javascript if need be but I was wondering if anyone knew of any plugins/native jquery that took care of some of this for me
[19:16:21] <neanderslob> rbo: I've looked at it and said "huh, that's a good idea" but never actually ended up trying it
[19:17:32] <rbo> I still prefer brackets because of how easy it is to edit certain things.
[19:17:49] <rbo> I need to learn more code :|
[19:18:28] <jbeeze> rbo: im a big fan of sublime
[19:19:20] <neanderslob> I'm a kate user which I'm usually pretty happy with
[19:21:04] <rbo> brb
[20:07:24] <teza19> Hi, I'm trying to send a new page to Google Analytics whenever and anchor is clicked on my page. I have the following piece of code in my JQuery, but it doesn't seem to be updating the 'real time' feed: ga('set', 'page', '/path');
[20:48:49] <VolkenasPHP> Does the .load() function use ajax to bring data from the server?
[21:08:54] <rbo> hey guys
[21:09:18] <rbo> when you're developing, do you normally just keep uploading the same file to the hosting server?
[21:16:59] <jbeeze> rbo: what d you mean uploading the same file?
[21:17:23] <rbo> i.e. make modification to the .js file and then reupload via filezilla
[21:17:47] <jbeeze> rbo: you should always test on a dev environment first
[21:17:55] <jbeeze> then staging, then production
[21:18:00] <rbo> ah
[21:18:14] <jbeeze> rbo: that's usually the 3-step process
[21:18:22] <rbo> I usually dev on xampp
[21:18:52] <rbo> but just create some secret dir's on my domain
[21:19:06] <jbeeze> rbo: you don't know what will crash a server
[21:19:19] <jbeeze> i remember uploading a controller file to the production server and it took it all down
[21:19:22] <jbeeze> but it was fine on dev
[21:19:37] <jbeeze> that's why you have that staging environment
[21:19:56] <rbo> never heard of staging until now o_o
[21:20:33] <jbeeze> rbo: a staging environment mimics the production environment as much as possible to simulate real world
[21:20:36] <rbo> I think me and google need to speak a little more.
[21:20:46] <jbeeze> so when you upload to production, nothing will break
[21:20:58] <jbeeze> know what i mean?
[21:21:37] <rbo> Yeah, I should know better in the first place since i'm always talking about my companies shitty live development in a production environment, yet here I am doing the very sin i dislike so much. Lol
[21:22:10] <jbeeze> haha yeah never test or develop in production
[21:22:13] <jbeeze> serious no no
[21:22:51] <rbo> You should see the systems I have to work with.
[21:22:58] <rbo> It really makes baby jesus cry
[21:23:35] <jbeeze> rbo: yikes im afraid to know more!
[21:23:43] <jbeeze> i guess working at a startup does have its benefits
[21:25:16] <rbo> :\
[21:25:42] <jbeeze> i mean i get a free macbook pro, but i work long hours and low pay
[21:25:47] <jbeeze> until hopefully more funding comes in
[21:28:23] <rbo> jbeeze, well you also get to interact with other people that also understand what you're talking about, too.
[21:28:52] <jbeeze> rbo: actually not really, most of teh devs are in a nother country
[21:29:00] <jbeeze> not outsource, just that the company started there first
[21:30:06] <rbo> I feel like i'm trying to race the entire world while learning development...
[21:30:32] <rbo> meh I think I just need to keep learning..
[21:30:33] <jbeeze> rbo: everyone is learning at all times
[21:30:48] <jbeeze> if you're note learning something new everyday, you're doing it wrong
[21:30:51] <jbeeze> not*
[21:31:13] <rbo> well
[21:31:20] <VolkenasPHP> Question: How would I go about taking the data from a table row (contained in 4 tds) and putting it in a form in the same page?
[21:32:32] <VolkenasPHP> I mean, I want to click one TR and have all the data included in the children TDs and pass it onto a form located in the same page.
[21:32:36] <VolkenasPHP> Hopefully that makes sense.
[21:32:43] <rbo> yeah
[21:32:58] <rbo> well depends on where the data is coming from
[21:33:49] <VolkenasPHP> The data is coming from a database through a mysql query in php looping while there are rows in that database.
[21:33:54] <VolkenasPHP> Here's how the layout looks http://gyazo.com/d7c2856aff9529da6f830c36b1df4311
[21:33:55] <rbo> If you're pulling it from a database you may want to use php to pull the information from the db and then build the php into your file
[21:34:24] <rbo> thats more of a #php question though :P
[21:35:43] <rbo> VolkenasPHP, can I PM you?
[21:36:15] <VolkenasPHP> Is it though? I mean, I got all the data I need through PHP. Now the thing is, how to pass the already represented data to the form. For example in that image above each of the TRs of the table is a row I pulled from the db.
[21:36:19] <VolkenasPHP> Sure.
[21:36:24] <rbo> VolkenasPHP, then there are things like data tables that you could use
[21:39:41] <rbo> Oh ok I got you now VolkenasPHP
[21:39:50] <rbo> I had to re-read your question. lol
[21:40:29] <jbeeze> VolkenasPHP: have you tried setting the input value ?
[21:40:41] <jbeeze> and passing through the specific table element
[21:43:14] <VolkenasPHP> Sorry let me say, I'm a complete noob at jQuery. I don't know what you meant.
[21:43:18] <VolkenasPHP> Which input value?
[21:44:08] <jbeeze> you can set values by selection the element
[21:44:13] <jbeeze> usually by the id or class
[21:44:50] <jbeeze> something like if input id ="name", the jquery selector would be $('#name')
[21:48:17] <VolkenasPHP> Alright, ty.
[21:48:20] <rbo> I sent him some steps to try copying from the table selector to the input. he would just have to modify it... hopefully that helps :\

[21:49:15] <rbo> I made it on my own one day ... lol xD
[21:49:42] <VolkenasPHP> rbo that truly helps a lot, thanks! I'll be analyzing it for a bit.
[21:49:51] <VolkenasPHP> And see how to make it work exactly.
[21:53:04] <jbeeze> haha
[21:53:24] <jbeeze> you understand what that means right VolkenasPHP ?
[22:01:27] <VolkenasPHP> jbeeze: rbo explained it to me through messages, really helped a lot, what a cool guy :)
[22:01:48] <jbeeze> awesome! was just making sure
[22:02:17] <rbo> or atlas tried to... I have this thing like some kind of developer trauma...
[22:02:22] <rbo> I need to get over that.
[22:14:54] <kongthap> hi, for now i separate .js files as http://pastie.org/9988884, i think it's simple for maintenance, what if i like to concat all files for production, how can i control "which particular coding part" to be executed for individual .html page?, please guide
