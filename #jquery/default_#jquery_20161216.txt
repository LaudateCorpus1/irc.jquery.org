[00:27:45] <Teeks> from e.target how can i check if a specific class exists ?
[00:28:44] <Teeks> e.target.id shows the element id, but e.target.class is undefined at the least
[00:31:48] <Teeks> ok got it
[01:07:59] <AppleGamer22> Hi
[01:09:12] <AppleGamer22> I am trying to debug jquery code in Visual Studio Code with the Chrome debugger but it cannot read the jq
[01:15:41] <lenswipee> AppleGamer22, so what you're going to do?
[01:39:37] <hellyeah> yo
[05:51:22] <zagaza> hey guys, I got a question for this https://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/037fjehu/. Is it possible that with js/jquery I can make sure the image always stays inside of the viewport and doesn't cause body to overflow? I mean if you hover those thumbnails, a bigger image shows. I wanna make sure this image always resizes so it doesn't cause overflow
[07:59:43] <hellyeah> what do you think about this thing? http://velocityjs.org/
[08:20:14] <MassDebates> hellyeah:  looks interesting. never used it.
[08:21:18] <MassDebates> There was a couple mentions about the comparative speed of animation between js and jq yesterday. Performance is definitely js, as the original asker was told, but this is a cool solution
[08:21:48] <MassDebates> Can't say it's totally unique, though. There's other engines that have a similar practice of avoiding jquery's faults
[08:24:59] <hellyeah> like?
[08:25:21] <hellyeah> i dont know that has svg support
[08:25:37] <hellyeah> which is good when you think jquery does not get along with SVG
[08:25:44] <MassDebates> It does have svg support.
[08:27:20] <MassDebates> I've not had trouble with SVGs in animation.

[09:12:31] <luv2quit> hello. i am using jquery and i am using .html() to return something form a div. at first the div is empty and i want to check if it is empty. how do i do it? i return the contents into a variable. i check if the varibale is null and i also checkd if thelength of the valriable is 0 but nothing works
[09:14:16] <Cork> luv2quit: length  < 1 or == "" should work
[09:22:16] <luv2quit> Cork: i found the problem. I had an empty row in the div so .html() did return something. so the length was not less than one. netiher was it "". i romved the empty line and now it works
[09:22:19] <luv2quit> thanks
[09:22:53] <Cork> luv2quit: i would recommend checking .children().length instead
[09:23:04] <Cork> it will check for dom elements instead of text nodes
[09:23:20] <Cork> (and wouldn't force the dom into a string)
[09:25:25] <luv2quit> Cork: thanks! i will be adding html and text to that div so .children() will be good
[09:25:48] <Cork> luv2quit: try to avoind using strings, it isn't efficient
[09:27:14] <luv2quit> Cork: how do you mean? Should i always check for elements?
[09:27:46] <Cork> luv2quit: hard to give specifics without knowing what you're trying to do
[09:28:08] <Cork> but as a generic example, don't take .html() modify the string and then .html(newString)
[09:28:15] <Cork> instead insert a new dom element where you want it
[09:29:35] <luv2quit> Cork: ok i understand. i should use append() or something similar. thanks for the advice. that actually feels like i have more control over what i am doing
[10:19:19] <randomnoob> Hello guys. Please help me if you can. I have this code http://kopy.io/C8cXA  . Problem is with Firefox. It does not send POST request. Found few topics about this. But it does not helped me.
[10:22:54] <wkuzar> Hey guys. I'm just learning jQuery and I'm very stuck in storing some stuff in a cookie. This is the code: https://jsfiddle.net/q1smcccn/8/
[10:23:21] <wkuzar> Ibasically have a working script that changes the default font size of some divs. Whenever the user goes to a different page, the font resets... Is there a way to store these changes into a cookie or something? So that the font size sticks
[10:23:30] <wkuzar> Any help would be very appreciated
[10:23:57] <taplar> take a look at localStorage or sessionStorage
[10:26:04] <wkuzar> I have. But I'm clueless on how to use it with my code. Erh, I'm very new to it
[10:26:47] <randomnoob> No advice for me?
[10:27:04] <taplar> i didn't see your q
[10:27:31] <taplar> wkuzar: checkout https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage for some documentation
[10:27:46] <randomnoob> Hello guys. Please help me if you can. I have this code http://kopy.io/C8cXA  . Problem is with Firefox. It does not send POST request. In Chrome works well. Found few topics about this. But it does not helped me.
[10:28:45] <taplar> what errors do you get?
[10:33:25] <randomnoob> I do not getting any errors. It just dont sends post
[10:33:46] <taplar> have you put console logs in the handler to verify that it is executing?
[10:34:08] <mikesrike> Hi. How can I get content of .element:after element in jQuery?
[10:35:45] <randomnoob> taplar how to do that? When I post it I am updating database data depending on it. In chrome it works in Firefox does not.
[10:36:11] <taplar> just stick some console.log('blah') in there and see if they log when you trigger the handler
[10:36:23] <taplar> cause this works for me in ff https://jsfiddle.net/ujvr5st3/
[10:36:36] <taplar> granted it's very weird since your radios don't share the same name
[10:36:44] <randomnoob> taplar alert works. location.reload() works
[10:37:09] <taplar> so you put an alert before the posts and you see them?
[10:37:43] <randomnoob> Let me check it again and make sure
[10:37:47] <taplar> mikebald: i'm not sure pseudocotent is selectable
[10:37:53] <taplar> *pseudocontent
[10:38:24] <taplar> could be wrong.  never ran into a use case were i had to try to
[10:38:49] <tre> guys i'm totally new to jquery, is it possible to define 2 elements in this code? i mean i want the same function if #sample is hovered or #other is hovered
[10:38:51] <tre> http://jsfiddle.net/2kyaJ/1497/
[10:39:09] <taplar> $('#sample, #other').on(...)
[10:39:30] <randomnoob> what the *** after post the alert() makes it working.
[10:39:45] <taplar> maybe it was a cache issue, *shrug*
[10:40:12] <randomnoob> removed alert() and it still does not work
[10:40:49] <taplar> k, not sure what that issue is then.  i'd have to see it breaking to debug more
[10:42:18] <randomnoob> eh
[10:42:52] <tre> taplar doesn't work
[10:43:36] <taplar> update your fiddle with what you are trying
[10:44:09] <taplar> though i have to ask why you are wanting to do this in js rather than just css
[10:45:57] <tre> cause it's not the same oject, i need to call another function, that's just an example
[10:46:26] <taplar> k, so yeah, update the fiddle with what you are actually trying to do
[10:50:21] <tre> http://jsfiddle.net/2kyaJ/1499/
[10:51:05] <taplar> why are you doing an interval?  you know there is a hover event, right?
[10:52:14] <tre> i'm not getting it
[10:53:42] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/2kyaJ/1500/
[10:56:29] <tre> i know that but that's not what i need, i need to know how i can say "if div1, or div2 or div3 etc is hovered do this()" and thought it could be possible with jquery
[10:58:55] <taplar> you are using jQuery 1.7 in the fiddle.  it doesn't know what :hover is.
[10:58:58] <taplar> use a newer version
[11:00:17] <taplar> though it looks like if you use :hover with multiple results it doesn't like that either
[11:01:16] <taplar> still not sure why you don't want to use hover()
[11:03:11] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/2kyaJ/1501/
[11:03:18] <tre> i'm totally new so i don't know nothing about jquery, i have a function and have an if() in that(...) i need to put "hovered one of these divs". so it's possible with that hover() ?
[11:03:41] <taplar> sounds like you need to take a look at learn.jquery.com
[11:04:15] <taplar> the use case for setInterval or setTimeout are relatively small, especially when the same thing can be done with events
[11:04:42] <taplar> if you can use an event to drive your logic, there's no need to infinitely loop checking for a state change.
[11:06:14] <tre> yes cause in certain condition the event screw up
[11:06:25] <taplar> how so?
[11:06:31] <tre> and can't figured out how to do
[11:06:37] <tre> well
[11:07:18] <tre> function when hover something and function when submit input
[11:07:55] <taplar> what's the issue?
[11:07:57] <tre> and i need to add that don't want the function of subtim to work when alredy is hover
[11:08:35] <taplar> then you check in the submit handler if whatever is hovered, is hovered, and if so you cancel the submit
[11:08:45] <MassDebates> Correct me if I'm wrong, but you want an element to appear when the user hovers a specific element?
[11:08:59] <MassDebates> Do you want it to persist after the user stops 'hovering' said trigger element?
[11:10:26] <tre> nope, it appears when hovered or when input field is not empty, but if i delete the value from the input field while the cursor is hovering the element it gets all the opposite
[11:10:53] <taplar> so instead of showing us this contrived issue, show is the actual issue you are trying to solve
[11:10:59] <taplar> otherwise we're kinda wasting our time
[11:13:26] <taplar> how goes it MassDebates?
[11:13:29] <tre> yes cause i tought it was simple and that sample was from stackoverflow, now i do the fiddle wait
[11:14:42] <MassDebates> I'm back, sorry
[11:15:04] <MassDebates> It goes well, friend!
[11:15:15] <taplar> good deal
[11:15:19] <MassDebates> how about you
[11:15:32] <taplar> fking cold.  i dislike this time of year
[11:16:28] <taplar> i need to like migrate to arizona
[11:18:38] <taplar> southern AZ.  apparently it looks like most of AZ has the same temp as we do.  bah
[11:30:15] <tre> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dOwvQg
[11:30:41] <tre> try empty the input field while the cursor is on the green div
[11:30:52] <tre> you'll get the opposite result
[11:31:08] <tre> and i can't figure otu how to resolve this
[11:31:44] <taplar> that input change handler is doing nothing to check the hover state
[11:31:46] <tre> i mean i tought about using jquery to get a condition if the div is hovered but i need more and not just one
[11:31:54] <taplar> it's just blanket checking length and doing whatever
[11:33:09] <tre> and? the problem is still there
[11:33:35] <taplar> why wouldn't it be?
[11:33:44] <taplar> code is only going to do what you tell it to do
[11:35:14] <tre> yes of course, and what i'm trying to tell you is, this is the best i can get, any chance you could help solve the bug i noticed cause i can't figure it out
[11:35:27] <taplar> ok, so clearly state what the bug is
[11:36:33] <tre> ok when i leave the green div the opacity drop, and that's ok, when i get in the opacity goes to 1, ok
[11:36:58] <tre> now the opacity drop when the input field is emty
[11:37:11] <tre> and goes to 1 when writing something
[11:37:17] <taplar> that's not stating the bug
[11:37:29] <taplar> the opacity is being reduced, in some case that it should not
[11:37:33] <taplar> what case is that
[11:37:49] <tre> the problem is, when deleting value from input field while having cursor on green div
[11:37:56] <taplar> ok
[11:38:02] <taplar> so
[11:38:06] <tre> you get the opposite result
[11:38:14] <taplar> how do you know if the cursor is over the green div?
[11:38:24] <tre> you can try
[11:38:31] * MassDebates hands taplar a purple heart for his tormented soul
[11:38:39] <tre> i mean you put the cursor on the green div
[11:38:44] <taplar> logically
[11:38:57] <taplar> how does the js know if it cursor is over the green div?
[11:39:22] <tre> well in that code i didn't tell js that
[11:39:35] <taplar> sure, but how can you?
[11:39:44] <taplar> that's your first step
[11:40:09] <taplar> the solution revolves around being able to know if the green div is hovered or not.  so you have to be able to identify that
[11:41:25] <tre> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dOwvQg
[11:41:30] <tre> this works
[11:41:48] <tre> cause i added if($('#menu').is(":hover")) { 			}
[11:41:58] <taplar> cool
[11:42:12] <taplar> you can also do ! to invert the truth so you don't have that empty {}
[11:42:32] * MassDebates watches as taplar teaches the concept of deception
[11:42:46] <taplar> eh?
[11:42:53] <MassDebates> "you can also do..." "... to invert the truth" is how a newspaper would quote you.
[11:43:09] <taplar> heh
[11:43:24] <tre> lol yes but that don't bother me
[11:43:27] <tre> anyway
[11:43:44] <tre> i already knew all that so it goes to my original question
[11:44:18] <tre> how can i add more element to monitorate their state?
[11:44:31] <taplar> i showed you in that fiddle
[11:44:37] <tre> what if i have 2 of the green div? how can i say that?
[11:44:45] <taplar> '#oneelement, #twoelement' will select multiple elements
[11:44:52] <taplar> or put a common class on them and select that
[11:45:45] <MassDebates> #oneelement, #twoelement, #redelement, #blueelement
[11:45:58] <MassDebates> Sorry, couldn't help that one. I will stop
[11:46:52] <taplar> personally i'd use a class
[11:48:26] <tre> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dOwvQg
[11:48:38] <tre> lookk now it's not working right anymore
[11:49:20] <taplar> seems to work for me
[11:49:41] <taplar> emptying the input doesn't change opacity if hovering over the red or green squares
[11:50:19] <tre> yeah cause it's not working anymore even when doesn't hovering nothing
[11:53:12] <taplar> so look at the console
[12:04:04] <dglambert> yo
[12:04:17] <taplar> buenos dias
[12:15:24] <taplar> mmm, i've had blink 182 stuck in my head for a while now
[12:15:57] <taplar> i needa find out who sings that new low song
[12:18:39] <taplar> ah jon bellion
[12:28:39] <tre> btw taplar just for news, i solved but had to use a lot of if-else, not exactly elegant nor easy with a lot of div like me
[12:29:03] <taplar> i got your codepen working with just that one if else
[12:29:17] <tre> but i don't care what's under the trukìnk so lol
[12:29:55] <tre> *trunk
[12:31:22] <taplar> $('#menu:hover, #menu2:hover').length worked fine for me
[12:36:26] <tre> now a stupid question, i have this code
[12:36:28] <tre> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/RoEVXG
[12:36:43] <tre> how would you write it in an elegant and short way?
[12:43:30] <WhirledPress> is it a bad idea to use Deferreds to ensure sequential firing of events rather than just for async events?
[12:43:39] <duch_kazatel> wut
[12:43:49] <duch_kazatel> you mean sequential firing of handlers?
[12:44:15] <WhirledPress> In othe words, I need a series of things to happen (animations or something) but each time the series might be different
[12:44:36] <duch_kazatel> so not events :)
[12:44:36] <WhirledPress> so I want to return promises after each thing and then string them together with .then()
[12:44:49] <duch_kazatel> you can do that.  iirc animations return promises today.
[12:44:49] <WhirledPress> sorry. bad word choice
[12:44:52] <duch_kazatel> i could have that wrong.
[12:46:11] <WhirledPress> so if I return a promise, is this possible? hideForm(frm).then(showPanel(pnl)).then(showForm(newfrm))
[12:46:50] <duch_kazatel> that depends on whether or not the stuff you're using offers some kind of callback/promise mechanism to notify you of when the animation has finished.
[12:47:26] <WhirledPress> so in the hideForm method, I would return a promise that resolved when the form was hidden'
[12:47:29] <duch_kazatel> oh sweet: http://api.jquery.com/animate/ animate supports .done()
[12:48:20] <taplar_lunch> your going to have an issue with that syntax that you have
[12:48:26] <CSwookie> Hey folks, I asked this before, but wasn't able to stick around for an answer, so apologies if I missed it.  I'm using a jqWidgets jqxGrid in my project, and I'm finding it pretty tough to test because it doesn't use regular scrollbars, but instead uses its own.  Is there a way for me to make it so the jqxGrid uses normal scrolling?
[12:48:31] <taplar_lunch> both those then() are immediately call their contained methods
[12:48:51] <taplar_lunch> well, the then don't call them, but the methods are invoking
[12:48:51] <WhirledPress> I have to wrap them in anyonymous functions then, right?
[12:49:09] <duch_kazatel> CSwookie i answered yesterday ;) you'll probably have to use CSS.
[12:49:09] <taplar_lunch> ya, or do bind() or something
[12:49:12] <duch_kazatel> or something.
[12:49:24] <WhirledPress> bind?
[12:49:32] <taplar_lunch> Function.prototype.bind
[12:49:32] <MassDebates> CSS?
[12:49:39] <MassDebates> To control javascript behavior?
[12:49:39] <taplar_lunch> google that
[12:49:46] <CSwookie> thanks duch_kazatel :(
[12:49:50] <MassDebates> What is this black magic you speak of duch_kazatel
[12:49:51] <WhirledPress> thanks taplar and duch_kazatel I appreciate the help
[12:50:03] <duch_kazatel> WhirledPress yeah def.
[12:50:22] <duch_kazatel> WhirledPress fwiw you usually want to hand the function object as your callback.
[12:50:41] <duch_kazatel> doing .then(foo(someArg)); will run foo and assign the return as the callback function.
[12:50:48] <duch_kazatel> which usually isn't what you want.
[12:51:53] <WhirledPress> got it. I was hoping that .then would work differently.
[12:52:17] <duch_kazatel> nah.  it's how javascript works :)
[12:52:53] <WhirledPress> 'exotic functions' are part of the ECMA spec? I love it.
[12:53:00] <duch_kazatel> wut
[12:53:08] <duch_kazatel> exotic functions?
[12:53:17] <WhirledPress> The bind() function creates a new bound function (BF). A BF is an exotic function object (term from ECMAScript 6)  that wraps the original function object. Calling a BF generally results in the execution of its wrapped function.
[12:53:28] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah.
[12:53:41] <WhirledPress> that's hilarious but a little confusing.
[12:53:47] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty easy.
[12:53:48] <duch_kazatel> lemme show you.
[12:54:05] <WhirledPress> gladly. thanks. I use bind for events on occasion
[12:54:15] <duch_kazatel> oh.  it's for the exact same reason :)
[12:54:25] <duch_kazatel> i'll still show you why.
[12:55:20] * WhirledPress loves how friendly jquery folks are
[12:58:24] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lvkumtkx/
[12:58:25] <duch_kazatel> WhirledPress
[13:00:30] <WhirledPress> got it got it got it! Thanks a ton. So the general idea is that paramters passed to functions are evaluated before they are passed.
[13:01:03] <WhirledPress> so bind lets you return a function rather than its result.
[13:01:04] <duch_kazatel> the general idea is that when you do someFunctionName() with parens, you're saying "when you read the code at this point, execute this function"
[13:02:12] <taplar_lunch> which for a then is 99% not what you want
[13:02:45] <duch_kazatel> ^
[13:03:21] <WhirledPress> A million years ago when Actionscript was the thing...lol There was thing thing called "fuse" that worked a lot like jquery but with animation
[13:03:23] <duch_kazatel> with deferreds you pass data around using resolve/reject
[13:03:41] <WhirledPress> it let you setup combinations of animations that fired sequentially and you could name fuses.
[13:04:06] <WhirledPress> so you could say: swingUp(someparams).swingDown(someParams) and the first would fire, then the second
[13:04:07] <duch_kazatel> you realize that jquery's animate features callbacks, right?
[13:05:04] <WhirledPress> sure, but you'd have to nest them rather than write them in a row...it sounds stupid, but it gets ugly trying to nest 5 different animations.
[13:05:17] <duch_kazatel> which is why you don't write your code that way ;)
[13:05:27] <WhirledPress> jquery does it
[13:05:33] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:05:44] <duch_kazatel> name those functions and then pass those.
[13:06:39] <taplar_lunch> animations also offer delay() as an option too
[13:06:59] <taplar_lunch> if you know the animation will take x amount of time
[13:06:59] <duch_kazatel> i'd avoid that in this case though.
[13:07:23] <WhirledPress> I guess if you had seen Fuse, you'd understand the beauty of it's simple syntax. It is A LOT like jquery syntax
[13:07:26] <duch_kazatel> wait a second...
[13:07:40] <duch_kazatel> WhirledPress did you ever try chaining those methods?
[13:07:59] <WhirledPress> that's what I thought I was trying with deferreds
[13:08:12] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[13:08:18] <duch_kazatel> i mean your "fuse-style" syntax.
[13:08:32] <WhirledPress> how do you chain syntax?
[13:08:45] <duch_kazatel> *chain calls, and... the same way?
[13:09:17] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/svd45ms2/
[13:09:23] <duch_kazatel> i forgot you can do that
[13:09:47] <taplar_lunch> animation queues, :)
[13:09:50] <duch_kazatel> ^
[13:09:55] <duch_kazatel> which are based on deferreds
[13:10:22] <duch_kazatel> and you can use promises on that element to control when stuff fires for the next element.
[13:35:53] <MassDebates> just so i make sure I'm not going crazy
[13:36:15] <MassDebates> $(x-whatever).click(func(){
[13:36:36] <MassDebates> $(this) inside of that functino will refer to x-whatever no?
[13:38:10] <taplar> should
[13:44:47] <duch_kazatel> api.jquery.com/on/#event-handler -> "When jQuery calls a handler, the this keyword is a reference to the element where the event is being delivered [...]"
[13:46:03] <MassDebates> yeah
[13:46:06] <MassDebates> It's not doing it
[13:46:12] <MassDebates> I wanna beat this thing like a red headed stepchild
[13:46:14] <duch_kazatel> "it's not doing it"?
[13:46:22] <MassDebates> Gar
[13:46:28] <MassDebates> Sorry, I'm trying to select and apply/remove classes.
[13:46:53] <MassDebates> Oh
[13:47:08] <MassDebates> Weird. That's not a normal typo. Class was C1ass
[13:47:14] <duch_kazatel> cool
[13:47:19] <MassDebates> as in addC1ass
[13:47:46] <MassDebates> It works now :)
[13:49:41] <duch_kazatel> anybody have any fun weekend plans?
[13:50:19] <MassDebates> Me and the lady are going on a fancy dancy dinner date night tonight!
[13:50:51] <MassDebates> Chicken Teriyaki is my favorite and we're gonna get some from my favorite place
[13:51:18] <duch_kazatel> very nice
[13:51:30] <MassDebates> $('.tabs p').addClass('inactive'); selects all p inside of .tabs right
[13:51:34] <MassDebates> or just 1st one
[13:51:37] <MassDebates> I remember it being all
[13:51:44] <MassDebates> nevermind, it's all.
[13:51:45] <duch_kazatel> all
[13:51:49] <duch_kazatel> just like with css.
[13:51:56] <MassDebates> OmG
[13:52:03] <MassDebates> EVERY SINGLE ONE HAS C1ASS
[13:52:05] <MassDebates> Someone did this.
[13:52:16] <MassDebates> I will return with blood on my hands brb
[13:54:33] <MassDebates> https://codepen.io/cssjockey/pen/jGzuK?editors=1010 in this the guy uses ul.tabs li
[13:55:02] <MassDebates> on line 3 in jquery. I want to know something though
[13:55:10] <duch_kazatel> $('ul.tabs li').click(function(){ ?
[13:55:20] <MassDebates> Aye, so basically he's targeting the list items
[13:55:30] <duch_kazatel> si
[13:55:43] <MassDebates> But if he makes it ul.tabs then the target area would be all tabs including the area where there's no li, no?
[13:55:57] <duch_kazatel> it would be the UL.
[13:56:22] <duch_kazatel> whose children are LIs.
[13:56:25] <MassDebates> Right, so it would cover, say, voidspace where there's no LI inside of the ul, right? (like spacing and margin)
[13:56:43] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[13:56:56] <duch_kazatel> kind of hard to open a tab when you don't click on the element for one.
[13:57:12] <MassDebates> Well, I'm not making tabs with this, I'm experimenting with jquery to learn some stuff about it
[13:57:18] <MassDebates> so my experiment is actually radio buttons
[13:57:29] <MassDebates> y'know hwo when you click a radio button, it gets filled but you can't uncheck it
[13:57:29] <duch_kazatel> then you wouldn';t use this at all.
[13:57:37] <duch_kazatel> youi'
[13:57:44] <duch_kazatel> *you'd use the change event.
[13:57:57] <duch_kazatel> and then ignore this entire process.
[13:58:23] <MassDebates> I understand that this isn't how you solve the problem, I'm not actually using this in production code or anything. I'm just coming up with sandbox theories for myself to see if I get stuff right
[13:58:39] <duch_kazatel> uh
[13:58:48] <duch_kazatel> that's a really strange way to do that.
[14:00:50] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eudecb2d/
[14:00:54] <MassDebates> I'm just trying to see if I can recreate radio buttons with an accessible indeterminate state with p tags
[14:00:57] <duch_kazatel> easy test case for it.
[14:01:04] <MassDebates> Ah
[14:02:19] <MassDebates> I'm adapting your case study
[14:02:25] <duch_kazatel> "case stufy" lol
[14:02:27] <MassDebates> This is what I was asking about
[14:02:27] <duch_kazatel> *study
[14:04:23] <duch_kazatel> needs moar box model
[14:05:53] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/eudecb2d/1/ duch_kazatel
[14:06:01] <duch_kazatel> uh
[14:06:16] <duch_kazatel> okay?
[14:07:01] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eudecb2d/2/
[14:09:36] <duch_kazatel> so what's the question?
[14:11:09] <vladikoff> rickymiller, hello, I jquery
[14:12:47] <duch_kazatel> wut
[14:14:15] <MassDebates> sorry I'm experimenting and that was a mid-progress thing. Working on it
[14:14:21] <MassDebates> I'll bring you something complete in a bit
[14:14:27] <duch_kazatel> "something complete"
[14:14:28] <duch_kazatel> wut
[14:14:34] <duch_kazatel> did you have a question orrrr...?
[14:14:56] <MassDebates> I did
[14:15:02] <MassDebates> I'm making sure I can't answer it on my own first.
[14:15:06] <duch_kazatel> 'kay.
[14:15:17] <MassDebates> Sorry, I'm a piss-ant like that.
[14:17:34] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/eudecb2d/1/ okay so here we go
[14:17:39] <MassDebates> This is what I was talking about
[14:17:55] <duch_kazatel> that's the same thing form a second ago.
[14:17:58] <MassDebates> I'm trying to figure out a way (not that I'm going to use this in production code or anything. Just trying to figure stuff out for myself)
[14:18:03] <MassDebates> yes I know
[14:18:28] <MassDebates> I'll show you what I actually did but I'd have to PM it
[14:18:35] <duch_kazatel> please don't then ;)
[14:18:38] <duch_kazatel> what's the question?
[14:20:10] <MassDebates> After clicking an li, it highlights blue. I was thinking I could detect a click on the UL to 'clear' the highlighting of the blue because I'm testing order of ops
[14:20:21] <MassDebates> It was as I've feared and as you've described, it's just like CSS
[14:20:27] <duch_kazatel> uh
[14:20:29] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:20:32] <duch_kazatel> you can do thta really easily.
[14:20:43] <MassDebates> WITHOUT doing the prescribed jq actions
[14:20:46] <duch_kazatel> so click on an li = highlight, click on the ul and it doesn't?
[14:20:53] <duch_kazatel> *it clears all highlights.
[14:20:59] <MassDebates> yeah, clears, not just nothing
[14:21:08] <MassDebates> but the reason why
[14:21:09] <duch_kazatel> that's easy.
[14:21:13] <MassDebates> but I want to reverse their orer
[14:21:16] <MassDebates> order(
[14:21:20] <duch_kazatel> "order"?
[14:21:26] <duch_kazatel> of what?
[14:21:36] <MassDebates> the way it fires, it's a pierce down from top layer to bottom of the z-index and relative to stacking context order
[14:21:42] <MassDebates> Er, at least if it's like CSS
[14:21:47] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating events.
[14:21:52] <MassDebates> Oh shit
[14:21:53] <duch_kazatel> events != like css.
[14:21:58] <MassDebates> okay
[14:21:59] <duch_kazatel> jquery selectors are.
[14:22:04] <MassDebates> Shit
[14:22:07] <duch_kazatel> events do, however, bubble.
[14:22:13] <duch_kazatel> from the originating element on up.
[14:22:13] <MassDebates> So I can't like
[14:22:19] <MassDebates> yeah, I can't reverse that?
[14:22:26] <duch_kazatel> why would you reverse it?
[14:22:37] <duch_kazatel> there's a capture phase but jquery doesn't support tjhat
[14:22:41] <duch_kazatel> *that.  and you don't need it here.
[14:22:42] <MassDebates> Hm
[14:23:05] <duch_kazatel> you mean you don' want the handler for the parent UL to fire when you click on an LI?
[14:23:11] <MassDebates> No I do
[14:23:15] <MassDebates> I want them both to fire
[14:23:20] <MassDebates> but I want the ul to happen first.
[14:23:23] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:23:26] <MassDebates> Can't do?
[14:23:27] <duch_kazatel> wrong way to think about it :)
[14:23:43] <MassDebates> okay, Good. I'm learning from this
[14:23:53] <MassDebates> Okay, one more thing
[14:24:21] <MassDebates> I then started thinking about using an interstitial element, like a blocker.
[14:24:29] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:24:29] <duch_kazatel> stop.
[14:24:31] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:24:36] <MassDebates> Wait wait its not what it looks like
[14:24:41] <duch_kazatel> way overcomplicating it.
[14:24:51] <MassDebates> It's not what it looks like i promise lmao
[14:25:00] <MassDebates> hahaha I've got a grin from ear to ear atm
[14:25:39] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:27:23] <MassDebates> |-ul-||-li-||-ul-||-li-|  <.<
[14:27:26] <MassDebates> According to the above diagram
[14:27:31] <duch_kazatel> wut
[14:27:34] <duch_kazatel> html pls.
[14:27:34] <MassDebates> lmao
[14:27:47] <duch_kazatel> because i have no idea what you mean by that.
[14:27:50] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/eudecb2d/3/
[14:27:53] <duch_kazatel> either way.
[14:27:56] <duch_kazatel> hjere's your first one.
[14:28:06] <duch_kazatel> stopPropagation is your frien.
[14:28:08] <duch_kazatel> *friend
[14:28:09] <MassDebates> No I don't want to use props
[14:28:13] <MassDebates> Thats too easy
[14:28:17] <MassDebates> Er, not easy but too like
[14:28:37] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:28:41] <duch_kazatel> "props"?
[14:28:49] <MassDebates> propagation
[14:28:51] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:28:53] <duch_kazatel> it exists.
[14:29:04] <duch_kazatel> and you'll have to work with it in the real world.
[14:29:22] <MassDebates> I know, and if this were for a real project I'd use it but I'm doing this to learn about events, firing orders, and stacking context used together.
[14:29:37] <duch_kazatel> "stacking context" as in z-indexing?
[14:29:41] <MassDebates> in other words, math class doesn't care if you get the right answer, so long as you learn about the process formula
[14:29:43] <duch_kazatel> because that has literally nothing to do with events.
[14:29:46] <MassDebates> Z-indexing and others, yes
[14:29:57] <duch_kazatel> yeah, those don't really have any impact.
[14:30:04] <duch_kazatel> if your mouse is on the element when it clicks, it first.
[14:30:06] <duch_kazatel> *fires
[14:30:21] <MassDebates> What about a nagging interstitial, like pinterest uses to get you to subscribe to see their content?
[14:30:28] <duch_kazatel> what about it?
[14:30:43] <MassDebates> well, 'your mouse being on an element' is depndent upon stacking order and context
[14:31:00] <duch_kazatel> that's the only way it matters.
[14:31:10] <duch_kazatel> things don't fire in different orders because it it.
[14:31:27] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[14:31:31] <MassDebates> So if there's clickthrough you hit everything
[14:31:39] <duch_kazatel> "clickthrough"?
[14:31:45] <MassDebates> yeah uh
[14:31:46] <MassDebates> 2 secs
[14:31:53] <MassDebates> okay for the ul example
[14:32:03] <MassDebates> Notice how it's positioned? top left 0 with absolute
[14:32:18] <MassDebates> If you have a second ul in there same styles, it would be in the same spot.
[14:32:38] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[14:32:47] <duch_kazatel> i don't see anything with absolute positioning
[14:32:50] <MassDebates> clickthrough is a CSS property but I don't think it has an effect on jquery events like that
[14:33:02] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/eudecb2d/1/
[14:33:07] <MassDebates> sorry, i forgot to link that
[14:33:20] <MassDebates> Oh no i did
[14:33:20] <duch_kazatel> and you mean pointer-events?
[14:33:26] <duch_kazatel> there's no "clickthrough" css.
[14:33:43] <MassDebates> pointer-events: none
[14:33:48] <MassDebates> it's often referred to as clickthrough
[14:33:49] <duch_kazatel> https://i.imgur.com/CAIXd59.png no positioning in here fwiw.
[14:33:57] <duch_kazatel> i've literally never heard that called "clickthrough".
[14:33:58] <taplar> just event bubbling
[14:34:11] <MassDebates> What URL is that?
[14:34:12] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, jquery supports that.
[14:34:15] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/eudecb2d/1/
[14:34:32] <MassDebates> ohhhhhh wait its not saved
[14:34:36] <MassDebates> lmao, god I'm so sorry dude
[14:34:44] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/eudecb2d/7/
[14:34:51] <duch_kazatel> but jquery recognizes pointer-events
[14:35:08] <MassDebates> okay, so If I do it in my original stylesheet then it affects it
[14:35:18] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[14:35:22] <MassDebates> ah!
[14:35:25] <MassDebates> kickass.
[14:35:36] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't rely on it often, but yeah.
[14:35:43] <duch_kazatel> browser support's still a thing.
[14:35:45] <MassDebates> So my theory would've not worked, but i was thinking about it for the right reasons
[14:35:57] <duch_kazatel> events are super simple imo
[14:36:02] <duch_kazatel> really easy to understand.
[14:37:21] <MassDebates> The reason why I'm doing this is because of the challenge i asked for and I got one, but I didn't make it out of pure CSS because nobody's actually competing with me so I figured I'd use this as an opportunity to practice on my jq
[14:37:35] <MassDebates> So i'm not actually doing that, I'm coming up with solutions to be as light on hte js/jq as possible
[14:37:39] <MassDebates> and use CSS as much as I can
[14:37:50] <MassDebates> But I figured I'd do something cool, so I'm doing a FPS version of pong
[14:38:11] <scrupul0us1> Could someone identify my jquery issue in pulling the element for this div so I can reassign the onclick address please? http://pastebin.com/0cHbzVUm
[14:38:25] <robertmaxrees> cripes.
[14:38:33] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:38:56] <taplar> scrupul0us1: i'd recommend using filter for that instead
[14:39:30] <taplar> or better yet put a class or id or something on it to select by
[14:40:06] <scrupul0us1> unfortunately i cant modify the source for this otherwise it would be much easier
[14:40:47] <robertmaxrees> theeeere we go.
[14:41:06] <taplar> you can try $("div[onclick='window.location=\'tickets.php\'']")​
[14:41:18] <taplar> but regardless your line 7 is going to be broken
[14:41:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:41:38] <MassDebates> The reason why I'm doing this is because of the challenge i asked for and I got one, but I didn't make it out of pure CSS because nobody's actually competing with me so I figured I'd use this as an opportunity to practice on my jq .

[14:41:39] <MassDebates> much as I can. But I figured I'd do something cool, so I'm doing a FPS version of pong
[14:41:48] <robertmaxrees> i saw your reasoning earlier duder.
[14:41:51] <MassDebates> Oh okay
[14:42:08] <robertmaxrees> so why are you in this channel if you don't want to use jquery?
[14:42:30] <MassDebates> I want to use parts of jquery, but I'm trying to exercise my creativity throughout the process.
[14:42:36] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:42:39] <MassDebates> Sorry, I'll stop asking stuff
[14:42:42] <MassDebates> Thanks a lot
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:42:56] <robertmaxrees> uh, nobody's saying you can't ask questions.
[14:43:00] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[14:43:41] <scrupul0us1> @ taplar: no love there either :/
[14:43:54] <taplar> on which part?
[14:43:57] <robertmaxrees> scrupul0us1 any reason you can't edit what's spitting out the link?
[14:44:50] <taplar> oh!
[14:44:55] <taplar> i missed the '.' in window
[14:45:02] <scrupul0us1> so im working with WHMCS and while they have hooks for many things, there are a few internals like support tickets that you cant over ride and since im not using their built in system, i need to override their URL's with my external jumps
[14:45:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd just replace the link at that point then.
[14:45:31] <robertmaxrees> if not in your backend, then using jquery.
[14:47:25] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeee
[14:47:46] <taplar> you ever have jsfiddle refuse to save for you?
[14:48:23] <robertmaxrees> non
[14:48:31] <robertmaxrees> ff gets weird with url updates though.
[14:48:49] <taplar> which i'm using, hmm
[14:49:22] <taplar> scrupul0us1: this works for me ... var $test = $("div").filter(function(){ return this.getAttribute('onclick') === "window.location='tickets.php'"; });
[14:59:40] <scrupul0us1> @ taplar when i go to use $('#'+test)…. its tells me its not define
[14:59:54] <taplar> i told you line 7 was going to be broken
[15:00:02] <taplar> why are you trying to look something up by an id?
[15:00:05] <taplar> you already have the element
[15:00:13] <scrupul0us1> ahhhhh
[15:00:15] <scrupul0us1> doink
[15:06:24] <scrupul0us1> well i do now get it… still having a hard time changing it though… ugh these guys
[15:08:43] <scrupul0us1> cant even so much as unset the existing onclick function
[15:08:48] * scrupul0us1 shakes fist
[15:08:54] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[15:09:07] <robertmaxrees> it'll be easier if you just replace the element.
[15:09:32] <scrupul0us1> heh you're bloody right
[15:09:51] <taplar> this.onclick = null will unset it
[15:12:46] <taplar> or likewise, $variable[0].onclick = function(){};
[15:15:07] <taplar> and even chrome is refusing to save a fiddle.  wtf
[15:15:11] <taplar> fridays....
[15:15:16] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[15:15:46] <taplar> lol, wait no, still ff.  just different resolution on my laptop so it made me think it was different
[15:16:11] <scrupul0us1> man .html .replaceWith all giving me the middle finger

[15:29:50] <scrupul0us1> i piggy backed line 6 on the end of line 5 and it worked (also used replaceWith not html)
[15:29:55] <scrupul0us1> fml
[15:30:00] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[15:30:43] <duch_kazatel> pippuccio76 you mean you want to .show() them in a particular order?
[15:30:47] <duch_kazatel> like slide one, then the other?
[15:31:45] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/9urbafhm/3/
[15:32:19] <pippuccio76> but i want first show line2
[15:32:28] <pippuccio76> than line3
[15:32:32] <SpecialTechnique> Is this correct? https://jsfiddle.net/324pb75x/1/
[15:32:38] <duch_kazatel> define "show" pippuccio76
[15:32:57] <pippuccio76> show()
[15:33:27] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9urbafhm/4/
[15:33:28] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:33:37] <taplar> SpecialTechnique: i assume the top part it to show what the storage variable is like?
[15:33:48] <SpecialTechnique> Yea
[15:33:58] <duch_kazatel> never never use ==
[15:34:03] <duch_kazatel> always use ===
[15:34:21] <duch_kazatel> though in this case you already have a boolean - one sec.
[15:34:24] <pippuccio76> duch_kazatel i want show first line2 than line3 not all in one time
[15:34:33] <duch_kazatel> pippuccio76 you want to animate them?
[15:35:09] <pippuccio76> no first click on #aggiungi show line two ,second click show line3
[15:35:26] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah
[15:35:34] <duch_kazatel> SpecialTechnique https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/324pb75x/3/
[15:35:57] <duch_kazatel> pippuccio76 use a data attribute with the number of clicks and use that to tell your handler what to do.
[15:35:59] <duch_kazatel> that's one say.
[15:36:00] <duch_kazatel> *one way
[15:36:12] <taplar> i might add a check to see if the element exists before trying to JSON.parse it though
[15:36:17] <duch_kazatel> ^
[15:38:44] <duch_kazatel> pippuccio76 this is one hacky way to do it: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9urbafhm/6/
[15:39:59] <SpecialTechnique> taplar, duch_kazatel - thanks, will do!
[15:41:29] <scrupul0us1> thanks for the help all
[15:42:04] <pippuccio76> i write this https://jsfiddle.net/9urbafhm/8/ but i can show only line2
[15:42:30] <duch_kazatel> pippuccio76 because var i only exists when the click handler runs.
[15:42:35] <duch_kazatel> you're not holding state
[15:43:02] <pippuccio76> this is ok https://jsfiddle.net/9urbafhm/9/
[15:43:13] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[15:43:16] <duch_kazatel> that's another way.
[15:43:22] <duch_kazatel> but give i a better name
[15:43:58] <pippuccio76> numberline?
[15:44:09] <duch_kazatel> 'huh?
[15:44:13] <duch_kazatel> var i = 1;
[15:44:19] <duch_kazatel> i is a terrible variable name.
[15:44:34] <pippuccio76> wath means give i better name?
[15:44:58] <pippuccio76> numberline=1 its ok?
[15:44:59] <duch_kazatel> right now you're calling it "i" - that's confusing.  give it a more descriptive name.
[15:45:08] <duch_kazatel> if you want.
[15:45:13] <duch_kazatel> whatever makes sense to you.
[15:45:55] <pippuccio76> how when i :) its equal 3 hide the button aggiungi?
[15:46:28] <duch_kazatel> the same as the other stuff.
[15:46:33] <duch_kazatel> only you use an if.
[15:47:07] <vladikoff> jQueryVariableOne = 1
[15:47:16] <duch_kazatel> ew
[15:47:58] <pippuccio76> ok go https://jsfiddle.net/9urbafhm/11/
[15:48:03] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:48:10] <duch_kazatel> sure
[15:48:25] <pippuccio76> im not able with jquery im a php programmer
[15:48:36] <duch_kazatel> you just did duder.
[15:49:12] <pippuccio76> im here to learn tanks
[15:49:20] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com is a good place too.
[15:50:04] <pippuccio76> but here is more immediately
[15:50:15] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:50:23] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com will give you better understanding.
[15:56:45] <Darmani> Hi guys, this is some source html from a form. How do I access the value with jquery?
[15:56:46] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/6f3834dbd6579cac318e339406ed7d2d
[15:57:05] <duch_kazatel> Darmani what have you tried>?
[15:57:53] <Darmani> Nothing yet. I figured I would probably use the "name" attribute on this line here.
[15:57:53] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/6f3834dbd6579cac318e339406ed7d2d#file-gistfile1-txt-L7
[15:57:58] <Darmani> I'm not sure though.
[15:58:02] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[15:58:06] <duch_kazatel> do you have control over the html?
[15:58:16] <Darmani> um... What do you mean?
[15:58:24] <duch_kazatel> can you edit the classes on that input, for instance?
[15:58:34] <duch_kazatel> attribute selectors are generally best avoided.
[15:58:36] <Darmani> Oh of course. Should I add a class and hook into it that way?
[15:58:55] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[15:59:00] <duch_kazatel> though
[15:59:01] <duch_kazatel> heh
[15:59:05] <duch_kazatel> user_address_street
[15:59:08] <duch_kazatel> you have that ID already soooo
[15:59:20] <Darmani> oh my god
[15:59:23] <Darmani> I didn't even see that.
[15:59:32] <Darmani> lmaoo
[15:59:52] <Darmani> Well thanks anyway lol
[15:59:56] <duch_kazatel> yep :)
[16:04:17] <Darmani> duch_kazatel: What about this?
[16:04:18] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/6f3834dbd6579cac318e339406ed7d2d
[16:04:29] <duch_kazatel> what about it?
[16:04:35] <Darmani> I want to make sure at least one of these checkboxes are marked.
[16:04:45] <duch_kazatel> then you don't wnat checkboxes :)
[16:04:54] <duch_kazatel> or is it a "one or more" scenario?
[16:05:03] <Darmani> yep!
[16:05:08] <duch_kazatel> give 'em a class.
[16:05:20] <Darmani> and then what
[16:05:24] <duch_kazatel> filter for checked ones, make length > 0
[16:05:52] <Darmani> damn
[16:05:56] <Darmani> you're good at this.
[16:06:05] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:06:06] <duch_kazatel> nah.
[16:06:18] <Darmani> zP
[16:06:19] <Darmani> xP
[16:06:20] <duch_kazatel> i just like .filter()
[16:12:09] <pippuccio76> hi , sorry , this is my working code: https://jsfiddle.net/9urbafhm/11/
[16:12:32] <pippuccio76> if i insert this in a table dont work why?
[16:20:32] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/9urbafhm/13/
[16:20:48] <pippuccio76> on document ready dont hide
[16:27:58] <duch_lunchatel> pipu huh?
[16:28:27] <duch_lunchatel> pippuccio76 * what's going on now?
[16:28:36] <pippuccio76> why when i insert the code in a table the hide function dont go ?
[16:29:04] <duch_lunchatel> because you can't use divs like that.
[16:29:25] <duch_lunchatel> div can't be a direct child of tbody.
[16:29:27] <duch_lunchatel> nor can form.
[16:29:54] <duch_lunchatel> you need to wrap the formaround the entire table and then put those classes on the <tr> elements instead.
[16:31:56] <pippuccio76> ok tanks  with id in tr works
[16:32:12] <duch_lunchatel> still need to move where the form is.
[16:32:14] <duch_lunchatel> but cool
[16:34:59] * taplar wonders if duch is related to dave attell
[16:38:15] <taplar> losing my mind man
[16:38:19] <duch_kazatel> hah
[16:38:44] <taplar> earlier i spontaneously went into a sterotypical ghandi impression and said "to find de bug, you must, debug"
[16:41:49] <Darmani> okay I officially suck.
[16:42:10] <duch_kazatel> sup?
[16:42:11] <Darmani> How do I map over this array and make sure one or more of these boxes have to be checked?
[16:42:12] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/9fed718a928b62e6fde7a63a49c69fc4
[16:42:24] <duch_kazatel> there's no array.
[16:42:30] <Darmani> oh yeah.
[16:42:37] <Darmani> hang on.
[16:42:43] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle instead yo.
[16:43:01] <taplar> $('selector1, selector2, ...').filter(function(){ return this.checked; }).length > 0
[16:43:01] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/9fed718a928b62e6fde7a63a49c69fc4
[16:43:12] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[16:43:15] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[16:43:15] <duch_kazatel> heh
[16:43:22] <duch_kazatel> look at taplar's suggestion./
[16:43:29] <duch_kazatel> but don't make an array of jquery objects.
[16:44:03] <Darmani> Isn't that an array of jquer objs?
[16:44:17] <duch_kazatel> what you made was, yeah.
[16:44:19] <Darmani> $('selector1, selector2') etc...
[16:44:21] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:44:24] <duch_kazatel> that's a jquery obkject.
[16:44:31] <duch_kazatel> it's "array-like",but distinct.
[16:44:58] <Darmani> And filter takes a  function that makes sure something is checked?
[16:45:11] <duch_kazatel> in this case, yep.
[16:45:19] <Darmani> What's length for?
[16:45:27] <duch_kazatel> see how many there are.
[16:45:34] <duch_kazatel> an empty jquery object is still truthy.
[16:45:39] <duch_kazatel> $() == true.
[16:46:01] <Darmani> How do I add an alert somewhere in there?
[16:46:17] <duch_kazatel> why are you alerting?
[16:46:35] <Darmani> Well that's what tells the user that something is missing.
[16:46:55] <duch_kazatel> so then use a conditional.
[16:47:07] <duch_kazatel> if (!somethingIsChecked) { alert() };
[16:47:51] <Darmani> Okay last question. How do I specify which checkbox is missing?
[16:48:06] <duch_kazatel> you could reverse the filter.
[16:48:09] <duch_kazatel> there's .not()
[16:48:11] <duch_kazatel> uh...
[16:48:12] <duch_kazatel> lots of ways.
[16:48:22] <Darmani> ugggg
[16:48:35] <Darmani> my head already hurts
[16:48:36] <Darmani> lol
[16:48:39] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:49:18] <Darmani> I'm just kinda frustrated. jquery, js doesn't come easy to me.
[16:49:28] <duch_kazatel> this is why fiddles are nice.
[16:49:43] <duch_kazatel> and a little thinking ahead is nice in cases like this.
[16:51:38] <Darmani> Yeah you're right.
[16:54:35] <taplar> var $allCheckboxes = $(...);  $allCheckboxes.not(':checked').addClass('error-border')
[16:54:44] <duch_kazatel> that's one way.
[16:54:56] <taplar> + .prop('title', 'Required')
[16:55:02] <taplar> heh, or something
[16:55:38] <Darmani> So... $allCheckboxes is a jquery array? Sort of?
[16:55:43] <duch_kazatel> jquery object.
[16:55:44] <Darmani> And :checked is a method you came up with?
[16:55:53] <duch_kazatel> :checked is a selector.
[16:56:02] <taplar> :checked is a pseudoselector that jQuery, and css, recognise
[16:56:08] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[16:56:12] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[16:56:55] <Darmani> ic
[16:57:01] <taplar> iirc jquery will take :checked and do that this.checked logic under the hood
[16:57:16] <Darmani> oh clever.
[16:57:20] <duch_kazatel> but it's different than using jquery.
[16:57:25] <duch_kazatel> fwiw.
[16:57:32] <duch_kazatel> sizzle doesn't use jquery for a lot of that.
[16:57:49] <taplar> let me see if I can find what i was thinking of
[16:59:20] <Darmani> What about error border? Is that yours?
[16:59:28] <duch_kazatel> yes
[16:59:42] <taplar> ah, nvm, the piece i was thinking of is indeed inside sizzle
[17:00:15] <MassDebates> For adding classes and removing classes, I've found several pros/cons for adding a negative or adding a positive class for interaction
[17:00:23] <MassDebates> For example, "current" and "inactive"
[17:00:29] <MassDebates> With swappable content.
[17:00:29] <duch_kazatel> uh
[17:00:49] <taplar> bootstrap, iirc, has it's own predefined borders for the states associated with the common log4j levels
[17:00:54] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:01:11] <MassDebates> I think I like "inactive" better than "current" - Anyone think that I'm on the wrong path for this regarding device/browser support?
[17:01:25] <duch_kazatel> MassDebates that has literally no bearing on device/browser
[17:01:31] <taplar> wouldn't inactive just be without current?
[17:01:35] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:01:40] <duch_kazatel> depends on the default state.
[17:01:46] <duch_kazatel> and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[17:02:38] <MassDebates> Sorry, phone call
[17:02:58] <MassDebates> If default state is hidden, much like this example
[17:03:16] <duch_kazatel> right, it's a contextual choice.
[17:03:20] <MassDebates> http://codepen.io/MassDebates/pen/fbb9fd650918c1e843910b8d78ce2774
[17:03:34] <MassDebates> This is using "Current"
[17:03:44] <duch_kazatel> btw
[17:03:48] <MassDebates> This is a largely unstyled example
[17:03:49] <duch_kazatel> don't prepend selectors with tagnames.
[17:03:54] <duch_kazatel> at least in js land
[17:04:06] <MassDebates> don't prepend selectors with tagnames?
[17:04:10] <MassDebates> Like
[17:04:16] <MassDebates> '#'+tag_id ?
[17:04:17] <duch_kazatel> ul.tabs  -> .tabs
[17:04:22] <MassDebates> OH
[17:04:23] <duch_kazatel> don't stick ul on there.
[17:04:44] <MassDebates> But what if I want to use a class that's both on p tags and div tags but I only want p?
[17:05:05] <duch_kazatel> then rething your classnames.
[17:05:06] <taplar> $('p').filter('.tag')
[17:05:19] <taplar> or flip
[17:05:21] <duch_kazatel> or target through a parent.
[17:05:38] <MassDebates> Okay
[17:05:45] <MassDebates> Why is prepending selectors with tag names bad?
[17:05:54] <duch_kazatel> it's code smell.
[17:06:04] <duch_kazatel> it's also a tad slower but that rarely matters in most cases.
[17:06:08] <MassDebates> is it on its way out or something? This is a CSS convention I use to reduce CSS load time on larger architectures.
[17:06:17] <duch_kazatel> it's code smell.
[17:06:18] <MassDebates> But I think the gains will be nullified and even reversed in jquery
[17:06:23] <MassDebates> Okay, understood
[17:06:38] <duch_kazatel> it's a sign that your naming convention is basically broken.
[17:06:48] <taplar> i usually try to split my lookups where i think they can directly be mapped to one of the underlying lookups
[17:06:53] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:06:59] <MassDebates> Okay
[17:07:09] <MassDebates> SO basically instead of a big spoonful
[17:07:16] <MassDebates> I take two little spoonfuls
[17:07:18] <taplar> dunno how querySelectorAll plays into that these days
[17:07:28] <duch_kazatel> it's used quite a bit, actually.
[17:07:50] <taplar> so will ul.tags be given to qsa instead of sizzle?
[17:08:08] <duch_kazatel> sizzle will delegate to QSA iirc.
[17:08:36] <taplar> ah, but it still has to go through all the logic to get to that step
[17:08:41] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:08:44] <MassDebates> This seems really odd
[17:08:48] <MassDebates> Not using tags before classes
[17:08:55] <duch_kazatel> it's because your classnames suck haha
[17:09:03] <duch_kazatel> if it feels weird, then your naming isn't good.
[17:09:19] <MassDebates> I'm not talking directly about the example, that's just shit code for myself like hte fiddles
[17:09:32] <duch_kazatel> doesn't change my stance ;)
[17:09:41] <MassDebates> I'm talking about usage with css naming architectures, some of which heavily rely on tag specifications put from w3 draft
[17:09:50] <MassDebates> Sure, BEM is okay
[17:09:53] <MassDebates> but what about smacks
[17:09:58] <duch_kazatel> back way ip.
[17:10:00] <duch_kazatel> *up
[17:10:08] <taplar> i might make the suggestion that perhaps there is a difference between classes you style with and those that you select with.  i think what robert is suggesting is that some times it's better that they not be the same
[17:10:09] <duch_kazatel> Classes can be used for both purposes.
[17:10:18] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[17:10:25] <MassDebates> Ah okay
[17:10:32] <MassDebates> Right that makes sense
[17:10:36] <MassDebates> I dig
[17:10:51] <MassDebates> Wait so jquery won't mind doing that too?
[17:10:56] <duch_kazatel> doing what?
[17:10:56] <MassDebates> Oh, of course, it selects just like css
[17:11:15] <duch_kazatel> sizzle is CSS plus some extras.
[17:11:16] <MassDebates> Well like
[17:11:31] <MassDebates> If I do a selector with this tthough
[17:11:32] <MassDebates> this being
[17:11:44] <MassDebates> $(this) referncing from inner scope of a func for example
[17:11:48] <taplar> not a selector
[17:11:52] <MassDebates> er, well
[17:11:54] <MassDebates> Like a selecotr
[17:11:59] <taplar> heh, but not
[17:12:02] <MassDebates> errmagerd whatever the hell it is
[17:12:04] <taplar> there is no lookup there
[17:12:20] <duch_kazatel> $(this) just passes the current DOM node through the jquery constructor.
[17:12:26] <MassDebates> If I grab the reference from the function origin and then i use (this) to pass the node
[17:12:29] <MassDebates> yeah
[17:12:32] <MassDebates> If I do what he said
[17:12:40] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with css selectors.
[17:12:48] <MassDebates> Then I can still use a selector unrelated to the operation?
[17:12:51] <MassDebates> oh
[17:12:59] <MassDebates> So I don't have to worry about it like, setting on fire or anything
[17:13:01] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:13:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm way confused.
[17:13:20] <duch_kazatel> $(this) and $('.someSelector'); both create jquery objects.
[17:13:25] <MassDebates> yes
[17:13:31] <duch_kazatel> one just nabs the DOM element that is 'this'.
[17:13:36] <duch_kazatel> the other goes and gets that for you.
[17:13:41] <MassDebates> So I can use both?
[17:13:49] <taplar> why not?
[17:13:50] <duch_kazatel> uh...
[17:13:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah?
[17:13:56] <MassDebates> oh my god
[17:14:01] <MassDebates> This shit is so much easier
[17:14:05] <duch_kazatel> you do it with event handlers all the time...
[17:14:12] <taplar> it's just polymorphism man
[17:14:19] <taplar> or whatever its called
[17:14:22] <MassDebates> I gotta stop overcomplicating things
[17:14:24] <duch_kazatel> $('a').on('click', function() { $(this).addClass('butt'); });
[17:14:48] <MassDebates> Wait so if I remove a class from something that didnt have the clas
[17:14:54] <MassDebates> it won't report that it didn't have the class then in the first place
[17:14:58] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:15:01] <MassDebates> it'll jsut delete nothingness, which will end in nothingness
[17:15:02] <duch_kazatel> it checks for you.
[17:15:12] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't try to delete it under the hood.
[17:15:16] <MassDebates> Really?
[17:15:16] <duch_kazatel> it checks for existence first.
[17:15:21] <MassDebates> oh that's kickass
[17:15:37] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.removeClass
[17:15:40] <MassDebates> Okay, well, I need to go delete lots of console.log s
[17:15:47] <duch_kazatel> you should check out learn.jquery.com
[17:15:50] <duch_kazatel> also fixingthesejquery.com
[17:16:33] <MassDebates> I'm trying to apply what-i-thought-to-be-common-sense to jquery and it's not agreeing because my assumptions were way off.
[17:16:46] <duch_kazatel> nah - just have a lot to learn.
[17:16:49] <taplar> most jQuery methods will not die if they have no work to do
[17:16:54] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:16:59] <MassDebates> okay
[17:17:04] <taplar> like, if you had 0 checkboxes that were checked
[17:17:10] <duch_kazatel> just like most will run .each() for you under the hood
[17:17:16] <taplar> $('input:checkbox:checked').addClass('weee')
[17:17:18] <taplar> would do nothing
[17:17:22] <MassDebates> But would it break
[17:17:26] <taplar> nope
[17:17:29] <MassDebates> I used to think yes
[17:17:33] <MassDebates> ohaokay
[17:17:34] <duch_kazatel> newp.
[17:17:36] <taplar> there are 0 element to iterate over
[17:17:42] <MassDebates> So it just does 0 times
[17:17:45] <taplar> yup
[17:17:50] <MassDebates> So really it's not that far off from javascript
[17:17:57] <duch_kazatel> ...
[17:17:59] <duch_kazatel> it IS javascript.
[17:18:04] <MassDebates> yeah but like
[17:18:07] <MassDebates> Idk people say like
[17:18:07] <duch_kazatel> nonono
[17:18:13] <duch_kazatel> it's javascript.
[17:18:19] <duch_kazatel> no ifs, ands or buts.
[17:18:22] <MassDebates> okay
[17:18:27] <taplar> [].forEach(function(){ console.log('weee'); });
[17:18:30] <taplar> would that break?
[17:18:35] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^^^
[17:18:38] <MassDebates> Well i used to think yes
[17:18:40] <MassDebates> but this is a no
[17:18:41] <MassDebates> right?
[17:18:44] <duch_kazatel> $().addClass('foo');
[17:18:48] <duch_kazatel> this doesn't error either.
[17:18:50] <MassDebates> Because inside of [] is nothing
[17:18:53] <taplar> right
[17:18:56] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:18:59] <MassDebates> Right
[17:19:14] <MassDebates> wow what a day
[17:19:27] <MassDebates> I feel like I just re-socketed my shoulder back into place.
[17:19:35] <MassDebates> Just a quick little *clunk*
[17:20:12] <taplar> which all of this is nice and handy and all, however this also should drive home that since things can silently do nothing, then you have to be absolutely sure that your logic is going to do what you think it will do
[17:20:27] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[17:20:38] <duch_kazatel> and learn how to use a step debugger.
[17:22:26] <MassDebates> Thats not console logging, right?
[17:22:27] <MassDebates> Let me google
[17:22:34] <duch_kazatel> fixingthesejquery.com
[17:22:40] <taplar> ^^^
[17:22:45] <duch_kazatel> great guide
[17:23:04] <MassDebates> oh
[17:23:25] <z1haze> if i want to do something to all forums with $('form').each( ... how can i do this but say ignore forms inside of the footer?
[17:23:35] <duch_kazatel> .filter first.
[17:24:10] <duch_kazatel> $('form').filter(function() { return !$(this).closest('footer').length }).each();
[17:24:17] <MassDebates> OKay I think I Do some of the things in this already but this will be a fantastic bookmark
[17:24:17] <z1haze> thank you
[17:24:28] <duch_kazatel> MassDebates the step debugger is huge.
[17:24:44] <MassDebates> I mean, I was able to do some stuff in jquery but there was like a misty area where i just did not go.
[17:24:57] <taplar> you should ask about those areas
[17:24:57] <duch_kazatel> because you just need to learn JS.
[17:25:06] <duch_kazatel> it's called "Programming"
[17:25:16] <MassDebates> yeah I'm not a programmer, I'm a marketer.
[17:25:26] <MassDebates> This is where i usually hire someone
[17:25:40] <taplar> programmers don't have to do it professionally
[17:25:47] <taplar> script kiddies are programmers
[17:26:35] <MassDebates> I always had a <3 for css/sass/etc so I often took styling into my own hands and worked with stuff that all of the CMs made together
[17:26:58] <MassDebates> But now I'll be able to do more and spend less as I continue to learn about scripting in general.
[17:27:12] <duch_kazatel> *programming
[17:27:14] <MassDebates> And a long time ago I used to actually write javascript, not copypasta, but make my own scripts.
[17:27:23] <duch_kazatel> JavaScript isn't really a scripting language any more.
[17:27:36] <MassDebates> Well it still works off of the basic concepts of functions and whatnot
[17:27:41] <duch_kazatel> ...
[17:27:44] <taplar> that's not what a script is
[17:27:47] <duch_kazatel> like every other programming language....
[17:27:56] <MassDebates> I DONT KNOW ANY PROGRAMMER LANGUAGES
[17:28:00] <MassDebates> GWAHR
[17:28:07] <duch_kazatel> *programming
[17:28:08] <taplar> javascript is a programming language
[17:28:10] <duch_kazatel> and that's fine.
[17:28:15] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^
[17:28:19] <duch_kazatel> you're learning one.
[17:28:27] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty featured these days, too.
[17:28:51] <taplar> if you are suggesting that just because you don't know every piece of it then you don't know it, then, well.  hell, i'd say robert and i don't know it either
[17:29:03] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[17:29:09] <duch_kazatel> my shift and 6 keys are about to break.
[17:29:13] <taplar> lol
[17:29:38] <MassDebates> Hm
[17:29:54] <MassDebates> Well I don't like saying i know javascript when i don't feel like i know javascript.
[17:30:00] <duch_kazatel> you're learning it.
[17:30:05] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make you not a programmer.
[17:30:14] <MassDebates> I mean
[17:30:16] <MassDebates> Look
[17:30:17] <MassDebates> CSS?
[17:30:20] <duch_kazatel> programmers learn languages all the time.
[17:30:22] <MassDebates> I can do anything it can.
[17:30:26] <MassDebates> I know CSS.
[17:30:31] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:30:33] <MassDebates> I know css better than 95% of the people on here.
[17:30:39] <duch_kazatel> chill duder.
[17:30:42] <MassDebates> Sure, it's easy as hell for most applications
[17:30:55] <MassDebates> but like, there's a seriously big difference between css and javascript for my knowledge, you know?
[17:31:01] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[17:31:03] <taplar> so?
[17:31:08] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make you not a programmer.
[17:31:09] <MassDebates> I'm flattered you're calling me a programmer but that's just not the case. Yet
[17:31:14] <duch_kazatel> sure it is.
[17:31:24] <MassDebates> you're making my heart swell
[17:31:36] <taplar> let me ask you this
[17:31:48] <taplar> if a guy knows something like html, or php
[17:32:02] <taplar> but doesn't know javascript, but he's starting to learn it
[17:32:06] <taplar> is he a programmer?
[17:32:21] <MassDebates> Don't hit me
[17:32:28] <duch_kazatel> really?
[17:32:33] <MassDebates> but i think of php like a scripting language
[17:32:37] <MassDebates> thought*
[17:32:38] <MassDebates> thought of*
[17:32:40] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:32:41] <MassDebates> past tense
[17:32:48] <MassDebates> And html isnt programming
[17:32:54] <MassDebates> its structured source code
[17:32:58] <taplar> your telling the computer how to act no?
[17:33:11] <duch_kazatel> (html is technically data but that's a different discussion.)
[17:33:15] <taplar> :D
[17:33:18] <taplar> fk
[17:33:19] <MassDebates> I mean we can fundamentalize definitions all day, but let's skip to ballistics here
[17:33:24] <taplar> *ahem*
[17:33:28] <MassDebates> If I put "javascript" on my resume if i were looking for a job
[17:33:32] <MassDebates> I would be lying
[17:33:38] <taplar> that's different
[17:33:39] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:33:42] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:33:44] <MassDebates> maybe something like "can google JesuScript"
[17:33:49] <taplar> that's saying you are proficient in it
[17:33:51] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating ideas there.
[17:33:56] <taplar> which would just be possibly inaccurate
[17:34:03] <taplar> doesn't mean your not a programmer of it
[17:34:08] <MassDebates> Isn't saying i'm a programmer in javascript the same thing as saying I'm proficient?
[17:34:12] <taplar> no
[17:34:13] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:34:15] <duch_kazatel> not in the slightest.
[17:34:22] <MassDebates> okay
[17:34:22] <duch_kazatel> i can play drums.
[17:34:23] <duch_kazatel> not well.
[17:34:25] <duch_kazatel> but i can.
[17:34:50] <MassDebates> Fair enough, I can play drums and I know many stick techniques (marching band in highschool and uni)
[17:35:00] <MassDebates> but I know how to play guitar even though I'm not good at it
[17:35:01] <duch_kazatel> sup marching buddy
[17:35:10] <MassDebates> I'm more of a ukulele and bass guitar fan tbh
[17:35:26] <MassDebates> But I can say I can play guitar, even though I'm not proficient
[17:35:32] <taplar> i'm all about the bass
[17:35:42] <MassDebates> SLAPPA DYEH BYEASS
[17:35:58] <MassDebates> okay guys
[17:36:00] <MassDebates> Thanks a lot
[17:36:25] <taplar> i'm slightly confused.  what goal were we trying to get to here?
[17:36:35] <MassDebates> Something something taplar making a script for me?
[17:36:42] <MassDebates> I think thats where we were.
[17:36:48] <duch_kazatel> lel
[17:37:13] <taplar> oh, you just didn't think of yourself as a programmer
[17:37:20] * taplar whistles
[17:37:34] <MassDebates> tbh I'm still a marketer. I just can do programming I guess
[17:37:47] <MassDebates> I'm a programming marketer
[17:37:52] <taplar> too much emphasis on labels bro
[17:37:56] <duch_kazatel> you're just picking a skill to label yourself with.
[17:37:58] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:38:03] <MassDebates> yeah
[17:38:08] <duch_kazatel> i'm probably as good of a guitarist as i am a programmer.
[17:38:16] <MassDebates> Oi! You play?
[17:38:20] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:38:24] <MassDebates> kickass.
[17:38:28] <duch_kazatel> and sing.
[17:38:36] <MassDebates> LOL yeah fuck that I don't sing
[17:38:39] <MassDebates> Except in the car
[17:39:25] <MassDebates> At any rate, I look forward to continuing my js/jquery education. I definitely got to a point where I can like, use it, but I stopped 'growing' with it
[17:39:38] <duch_kazatel> (just call it js education btw)
[17:39:46] <MassDebates> Right, cause it's a lib
[17:39:55] <taplar> just gotta have a goal
[17:39:56] <duch_kazatel> (nobody says they're a "spring programmer"
[17:39:58] <duch_kazatel> )
[17:40:05] <MassDebates> Does anyone ever decide to like
[17:40:07] <MassDebates> half-load the lib
[17:40:11] <taplar> sure
[17:40:19] <MassDebates> Okay
[17:40:21] <taplar> there's the whole jquery slim now
[17:40:28] <MassDebates> Oh really
[17:40:37] <MassDebates> I shall devise my expert research methods (google)
[17:40:38] <taplar> yeah, check the website, it will link to the repo for it
[17:40:56] <taplar> you exclude what you don't want during the build process, iirc
[17:41:17] <MassDebates> Oh shoot
[17:41:20] <duch_kazatel> yeah, custom builds.  AMD iirc.
[17:41:26] <duch_kazatel> just pull in what you need.
[17:41:39] <MassDebates> I need to go drink and digest
[17:42:00] <MassDebates> I'll ttyl guys
[17:42:09] <duch_kazatel> k
[17:45:25] <taplar> heh, you can exclude sizzle
[17:45:34] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:45:59] <MassDebates> Okay, I just saved a log of this conversation.
[17:46:03] <MassDebates> I will refer back to it.
[17:46:05] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:46:08] <MassDebates> Thanks again.
[17:46:10] <duch_kazatel> you know irc.jquery.org has logs, right?
[17:46:16] <MassDebates> yeah but like
[17:46:23] <MassDebates> My email vs irc.jquery.org ?
[17:46:26] <MassDebates> My email.
[17:46:45] <taplar> do you have greasemonkey?
[17:46:49] <duch_kazatel> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20161216.log.html (shrug)
[17:46:51] <MassDebates> I have lots of grease monkeys.
[17:46:56] <taplar> let me share this out then
[17:47:04] <arosen> is there a way to do a mouseout event that only triggers once it's a set number of pixels out from the element?
[17:47:16] <MassDebates> Wait are we talking people? I'm the only one here right now
[17:47:26] <MassDebates> Our office hours are from 9-5 so I don't really have anyone else here
[17:47:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6o8yyj9z/
[17:47:56] <MassDebates> Oh
[17:47:58] <MassDebates> user scripts
[17:47:59] <duch_kazatel> arosen not really?
[17:48:09] <taplar> removes all the crap from the logs
[17:48:13] <MassDebates> I don't have any user script utilities
[17:48:14] <taplar> so you see just the conversations
[17:48:21] <taplar> that's for greasemonkey man
[17:48:31] <MassDebates> Oh I thought you m
[17:48:32] <MassDebates> OKay
[17:48:36] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[17:48:41] <duch_kazatel> what did you think he meant?
[17:48:41] <MassDebates> I will find greasemonkey and I will get it
[17:48:45] <MassDebates> people?
[17:49:05] <taplar> greasemonkey, or tampermonkey, depending on FF or Chrome
[17:49:27] <MassDebates> Got it
[17:49:41] <MassDebates> Sorry, brain fart
[17:49:50] <MassDebates> i thought you meant the general term grease monkey
[17:50:16] <taplar> i'm not in Grease man
[17:50:42] * taplar now has grease lightning in his head
[17:51:12] <MassDebates> No, like "any single one person who is incredibly skilled in a certain discipline or art, but typically doesn't like to talk to others or bug them" basically my favorite people
[17:51:25] <duch_kazatel> wut
[17:51:38] <duch_kazatel> i've never heard that term heard that way
[17:51:40] <MassDebates> oftne used to refer to car mechanics
[17:51:46] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:51:55] <duch_kazatel> not "any single one person [...]"
[17:52:02] <taplar> every mechanic i've ever met loves to talk
[17:52:02] <MassDebates> Yeah, danny refers to himself as a grease monkey
[17:52:10] <MassDebates> Doesn't like to talk to others
[17:52:14] <MassDebates> hes a server admin
[17:52:24] <duch_kazatel> that's odd.
[17:52:26] <taplar> he's a code monkey
[17:52:35] <MassDebates> No he doesn't code
[17:52:39] <taplar> lol
[17:52:54] <MassDebates> He asked me how to do something in js the other day and i barely managed to get him through the task
[17:53:06] <MassDebates> luckily it was really basic
[17:53:10] <taplar> so you're saying nothing with maintaining servers has anything to do with code?
[17:53:20] <MassDebates> H/W
[17:53:25] <MassDebates> yeah he does some
[17:54:03] <MassDebates> hey man, I'm just parroting right now
[17:54:23] <MassDebates> I'm not cutting him down, he's self described as not a coder
[17:54:28] <MassDebates> and he's certainly said he's a grease monkey
[17:54:30] <MassDebates> I know that for sure
[17:54:45] <MassDebates> The language barrier isn't hindering me here
[17:54:47] <taplar> well, i'm a hot american model
[17:54:51] <taplar> so it must be true
[17:55:07] <MassDebates> I know it's true because I watch you at night.
[17:55:07] <duch_kazatel> yess
[17:55:10] <duch_kazatel> *yeesh
[17:55:16] <taplar> heh
[17:55:18] <MassDebates> OH wait
[17:55:21] <MassDebates> No, that makes sense
[17:55:24] <MassDebates> He's a huge car fan
[17:55:29] <MassDebates> Sorry, totally forgot
[17:55:32] <taplar> lol
[17:55:39] <MassDebates> lmao I need to go drink. Cya guys
[17:57:40] <taplar> having a debate with massdebates.  irony?
[17:57:55] <duch_kazatel> heh.
[17:58:05] <duch_kazatel> the pun in the name almost ruins it.
[17:58:56] <taplar> wow, you know, i always added a pause when i say his name...
[17:59:03] <duch_kazatel> yeah....
[17:59:37] <taplar> eh, he's alright.  real up standing guy
[18:00:44] <taplar> little quick to react sometimes, but
[18:00:58] <duch_kazatel> this guy
[18:01:26] <taplar> hey, i'm just saying.  if your looking for a do it yourself guy, he's your man
[18:01:34] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[18:06:11] <taplar> had a pretty good one yesterday.  there was an email that was sent out to all the it staff about a free lunch and there was a typo in it for "FIRST COME FIST SERVE!!!"
[18:06:20] <taplar> and I replied to all with "wow, competitive"
[18:06:55] <duch_kazatel> hahahahah
