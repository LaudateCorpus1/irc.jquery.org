[00:01:47] <Jagan_> hi
[00:01:52] <coldhead> that's probably the right approach, Xotix
[00:01:59] <coldhead> the even more right approach is to use a plugin
[00:02:04] <coldhead> that's been tested to hell already
[00:02:08] <coldhead> and will take you 5 minutes
[00:02:17] <coldhead> but you can lead a whore to water, you cannot make her think
[00:02:27] <coldhead> that's more offensive than i meant it to be
[00:02:29] <Xotix> coldhead no plugin support cross domain
[00:02:51] <coldhead> if this doesn't https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[00:02:59] <Xotix> and using the iframe hack will work great, I'm quite sure.
[00:03:01] <coldhead> you could always add it and submit a pull request
[00:03:10] <coldhead> for great and abiding justice
[00:03:24] <Jagan_> I want to compare system date with another date. if  date > Date() return false.. help me
[00:03:37] <Xotix> don't like hacking stuff together with a plugin. no need of progress bar, previews etc. i like it simple.
[00:03:57] <coldhead> you're a brave fellow, Xotix
[00:04:13] <coldhead> i hope you share the fruits of your labours
[00:04:40] <porteixen> Can someone remind me what the term is when you provide a less-capable "fallback" version of an advanced feature?
[00:04:40] <coldhead> the above does support cross domain apparently, Xotix
[00:04:51] <Xotix> coldhead, are there any bigger problems to expect when using iframes? i mean, its a normal http post request. This together with postMessage() to get the answer.
[00:05:01] <porteixen> for instance <noscript> is a "fallback" for <script> when JS is disabled in browsers.
[00:05:12] <porteixen> is "fallback" the term I'm thinking of, or is there a better word for it?
[00:05:18] <coldhead> i've never tried, Xotix, i back away from the iframe stage
[00:05:28] <coldhead> i've seen some coworkers go bald trying to do it though
[00:05:37] <coldhead> and i don't think they even succeeded :(
[00:05:54] <coldhead> i'd call that a fallback, porteixen
[00:06:12] <coldhead> other hot terms are "graceful degradation", "progressive enhancement" and "shim"
[00:06:12] <porteixen> k.
[00:06:39] <porteixen> yeah, graceful degredation was closer to what I was thinking of.
[00:06:51] <Xotix> hmm, i'll try it.can't imagen it is hard to do.a form with target=iframe basically.
[00:06:55] <porteixen> thanks :)
[00:07:12] <coldhead> it gets hard, Xotix
[00:07:22] <coldhead> browser inconsistencies and talking to/from the iframe
[00:07:36] <coldhead> well i find those things hard anyway
[00:07:40] <coldhead> i'm not very good at this
[00:07:48] <kevwilde> hi, is there a way I can do cross-origing ajax requests for json, without resorting to jsonp?
[00:07:53] <Xotix> i'll try, really thin kits easy :P
[00:08:02] <coldhead> my core strength as a developer is making porridge
[00:08:03] <iateadonut> i ended up doing it like this, by the way: if ( !$(e.target).is('#close5') && $('#keywordGraphDiv').length !== 0 ) {
[00:08:10] <iateadonut> if the target is the not the 'close' link and the big div exists
[00:08:23] <coldhead> cool iateadonut
[00:08:42] <coldhead> kevwilde: not without involving a proxy on your server
[00:09:06] <kevwilde> coldhead: i have an nginx reverse-proxy on it
[00:09:34] <coldhead> kevwilde: does that do what you want?
[00:09:37] <coldhead> if so, good work

[00:12:00] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[00:13:41] <diverdude> From my client i am sending a file like this: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1519976962   On the server i just do: Mylog::write('debug', serialize($_FILES)); (the Mylog object works well, problem is not there). However, in the logfile it states that the $_FILES array only contain: a:0:{}. What am I doing wrong? Why is the file not posted?
[00:14:54] <coldhead> >: |
[00:16:32] <coldhead> you might have better luck with the cave people in #javascript, diverdude
[00:16:32] <OffN> hi everyone, I'm trying to disable my save button when I click on it on a "confimartion" Jquery pop-up, how can I do it plz?
[00:16:40] <coldhead> we no speaky much raw XHR here
[00:17:07] <coldhead> .attr('disabled', 'disabled'), OffN ?
[00:17:43] <OffN> the thing is, when I use $(this) after the click function, this refers to my form
[00:17:43] <OffN> :/
[00:18:01] <coldhead> would you care to show us your code?
[00:18:10] <OffN> np :)
[00:19:33] <OffN> http://pastebin.com/VnWyJtgk
[00:20:03] <asher^> youll have to pass it the id of the button or something like that
[00:21:01] <pifantastic> OffN: try setting your argument of your click handler to e
[00:21:02] <pifantastic> and then do
[00:21:08] <pifantastic> $(e.target)
[00:21:12] <pifantastic> instead of $(this)
[00:21:37] <coldhead> that's good mind grapes, pifantastic
[00:21:57] <asher^> ^
[00:22:42] <OffN> asher^: i dont want to use ids because I want to make it kinda "generic"
[00:23:03] <OffN> pifantastic: what should be the declaration of e? i dont get it :p
[00:23:41] <pifantastic> OffN: http://pastebin.com/hSGknvPT
[00:26:13] <OffN> pifantastic ty
[00:26:51] <OffN> but
[00:26:56] <OffN> $(e).attr("disabled", "disabled");
[00:26:59] <OffN> not working :p
[00:27:09] <coldhead> $(e.target)
[00:27:29] <OffN> ohhhhhh
[00:27:31] <pifantastic> return false; at the end of your click handler
[00:27:33] <OffN> im so stupid
[00:27:33] <OffN> x)
[00:27:35] <OffN> sry
[00:27:36] <OffN> :D
[00:27:36] <rethus> why this if()-Loop didn't catch the empty select-options? http://pastebin.com/7fJrVx8B
[00:27:42] <coldhead> you're not stupid, don't feel bad
[00:28:11] <coldhead> lose the quotes on 'undefined', rethus
[00:28:19] <coldhead> it's a first class value, not a string
[00:28:25] <rethus> k
[00:28:30] <OffN> I'm feeling stupid every hours I'm doing programming, so I'm ok now x)
[00:28:36] <OffN> thx a lot for your help guys
[00:28:38] <OffN> :)
[00:28:51] <pifantastic> rethus: or use typeof
[00:29:04] <rethus> typeoff(undefined)?
[00:29:07] <pifantastic> which is technically safer, as someone could have defined undefined elsewhere
[00:29:23] <pifantastic> $(this).val() === false || typeof $(this).val() === 'undefined'
[00:29:30] <pifantastic> or
[00:29:34] <pifantastic> $(this).val() === false || $(this).val() === undefined
[00:30:41] <coldhead> or if (! $(this).val() )
[00:30:47] <coldhead> if you're not into prollixity
[00:31:12] <pifantastic> good point
[00:31:42] <pifantastic> that will catch 0 too
[00:31:48] <pifantastic> just fyi
[00:32:00] <Xotix> Coldhead http://pastebin.com/VymUQmSE this works in every newer browser. maybe doing it dynamic with js will cause some probs.
[00:32:49] <coldhead> i don't have a problem with catching 0 or ''
[00:32:56] <coldhead> they're all false to me girlfriend
[00:33:55] <coldhead> or maybe not, Xotix!
[00:34:00] <coldhead> maybe its Just That Easy
[00:34:13] <Xotix> ie8 makes trouble though
[00:34:20] <pifantastic> boy does it
[00:34:47] <Xotix> ah no its some hosts config fail :)
[00:34:57] <coldhead> i don't think i've ever tested IE8 in my life
[00:35:05] <coldhead> ie7 was the last time i had to care
[00:35:12] <coldhead> then i just delegated my testing to manila
[00:35:17] <Xotix> don't care about ie7
[00:35:21] <coldhead> god bless that proud island
[00:35:33] <coldhead> and the persistent ie testers it engenders
[00:36:13] <Xotix> i rather say "user, make an update" then do some extra work. and most stuff i use isn't that broken in ie7. mostly layout stuff.
[00:38:10] <coldhead> well said
[00:38:48] <Xotix> ie9 makes Tulpen.jpg (a default picture of windows) to tulpis.jpg o.O and the iframe as a target doesnt work if you name it myIframe...
[00:39:22] <coldhead> the prophecy is coming true!
[00:41:34] <rethus> pifantastic: thanks
[00:45:39] <rethus> mhh seems not to work... http://jsfiddle.net/suther/LAQ9F/23/
[00:46:10] <becom33> I to make a form which is dynamic . my customer wants to create his own forms . is there any plugin or somthing they easily can do that
[00:46:11] <rethus> pifantastic: please press add filter >> more and "speichern"... then in firebug a message should appear. it doesn't
[00:48:03] * becom33 anyone ?
[00:48:07] <rethus> pifantastic: maybe the return value of an empty select is not false, but only empty string?
[00:50:51] <aquareality> i need help figuring out how to make a site that currently reloads pages to display menu section content - make it stop reloading the page and simply have the text for each section slide in
[00:51:07] <aquareality> i can give ftp access so the person who helps me can look around
[00:52:30] <aquareality> the site currently reloads the page to display separate pages in the menu (3 total).. i would like everything to be done on the home page without page refreshes and navigating to get pages.. i would like the content to simply slide in instead
[00:52:52] <Nece228> hello
[00:52:57] <aquareality> i'm not a total newbie. i could just use somoene knowledgable to login the the ftp, look around and tell me my best route
[00:53:01] <Nece228> items.push('<table border="1"><tr><th>Title</th><th>Date</th></tr><tr><td>' + val.name + '</td><td>' + val.date + '</td><td><button id="delete">Delete Entry</button></td></tr></table>')
[00:53:12] <Nece228> im looking for a more convenient way to do that
[00:53:27] <aquareality> pm me if you can help me please
[00:53:39] <Nece228> perhaps its possible to actually write everything in index.html and later append only the variables?
[00:54:06] <Cork> Nece228: check one of the many templating plugins
[00:54:25] <Nece228> Cork: where?
[00:54:37] <Cork> ?g jqote2
[00:54:39] <bot-t> Cork, jQote2 – Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code - http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[00:54:41] <Cork> ex.
[00:57:49] <Nece228> not sure if thats what i want
[00:58:19] <Cork> Nece228: theres many other
[00:58:28] <Cork> some loads html files
[00:58:57] <Cork> but what you described is a template
[00:59:51] <Abbas-> guys, this code is running (as in i can see it remove the background image from a <li> when hovering out of it, but i think i got the 'css' code wrong in line 2, because it doesnt apply the image (the same code works fine in css w/o js/juqery) plz help > http://pastebin.com/1k0RyPfP
[01:00:36] <Cork> Abbas-: you can't use shorthands
[01:01:15] <Abbas-> yes just thought of that, i removed the other args
[01:01:20] <Abbas-> left url('xyz') only
[01:01:22] <Abbas-> but that too doesnt work
[01:01:35] <Cork> your sure you want relative url?
[01:01:39] <Cork> and not absolute?
[01:01:46] <Cork> /image/...
[01:02:14] <Abbas-> oh
[01:02:15] <Abbas-> :o
[01:02:20] <Abbas-> yeah the script is in /scripts/
[01:02:25] <Abbas-> in .css , that file was in root
[01:02:26] <Abbas-> :o
[01:02:27] <Cork> heh
[01:02:43] <Abbas-> how do i go back on directoyr? ../images/xyz.jpg ?
[01:03:13] <Abbas-> ok ../images/ doesnt work
[01:04:07] <Cork> Abbas-: you should always refer to images with absolute urls
[01:04:36] <Abbas-> is that a requirement? this site im working on is temporary location, its not on a domain yet
[01:04:57] <Cork> Abbas-: depends on your structure
[01:05:16] <Cork> Abbas-: the referenced current url is the document
[01:05:26] <Cork> so its the css file or the html files location
[01:05:56] <xec> Cork: why absolute urls for images?
[01:06:22] <Cork> xec: cause you normally have a fixed position for the image
[01:06:34] <Cork> if you have a relative location to each html file, sure
[01:06:59] <Cork> like example.com/images/someimage.png and like example.com/support/images/someimage.png
[01:07:27] <Abbas-> Cork my structure is like c:/temp/images , c:/temp/scripts and the main html files are in c:/temp
[01:07:35] <xec> Cork: right, well, it's enough to start with the root dir really, in that case - /images/... will always start at root
[01:07:40] <Cork> else you will have to keep remembering to modify the ../../.. ... reference
[01:07:40] <Abbas-> if i use that, i'll have to modify the files each time i move them
[01:08:08] <Cork> xec: thats what i meant with absolute
[01:08:16] <Cork> i didn't mean fqdn
[01:08:21] <xec> i see
[01:08:51] <Cork> Abbas-: use a small local webserver for you development
[01:08:57] <Cork> Abbas-: and then you don't need to modify it
[01:09:03] <Abbas-> yes i m using xampp
[01:09:09] <Cork> uh...
[01:09:28] <Abbas-> its more like localhost/proj1/images
[01:09:33] <Cork> why are you referencing your files through c:/ if you have a webserver?
[01:09:43] <Abbas-> nah i was just telling you structure of my proj folders
[01:09:45] <Cork> Abbas-: so whats the problem?
[01:09:52] <Abbas-> even then the ../images/ doens twork for me within js
[01:09:53] <Cork> ah
[01:09:55] <fRAiLtY-> When I click on a drop-down here http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing it unregisters/turns off the more/less jQuery just above in the top paragraph, why?
[01:09:59] <Cork> you have a mapp for each project
[01:10:01] <Abbas-> the background im assigning doesnt get applie
[01:10:23] <Cork> Abbas-: create aliases for each project and add it to you host file
[01:10:43] <Cork> 127.0.0.1 proj1.development.local
[01:11:42] <Abbas-> ah
[01:12:01] <Abbas-> and then i put in proj1.dev.local/imges/xyz.png in the custom.js ?
[01:12:07] <Abbas-> oh
[01:12:10] <Cork> no
[01:12:13] <Abbas-> you mean ../images/ shud work then
[01:12:24] <Cork> then config your server to use proj.dev.local for the project
[01:12:34] <Cork> and then put "/images/..." in your code
[01:12:42] <Cork> no .. and no domain
[01:13:11] <Abbas-> oh
[01:13:14] <Cork> and it will work on any site as long as its positiond at the sam depth
[01:13:21] <Cork> *same
[01:13:45] <Cork> smallest maintainence cose
[01:13:59] <Cork> *cost
[01:14:28] <Abbas-> so this won't work, until i setup the alias? http://i.imgur.com/mSHZF.jpg
[01:14:58] <Cork> Abbas-: you will need to adjust the url to what page on the site your on
[01:15:20] <Cork> if the script is loaded on /support/contact/index.html its ../../images/
[01:15:34] <Cork> if its on /products/index.html its ../images/
[01:15:44] <Cork> and so on
[01:16:05] <Abbas-> well im on the root page /index.php
[01:16:13] <Abbas-> when means 'images/xyz.png' should work
[01:16:16] <Abbas-> but its not working
[01:16:18] <Abbas-> im doing something wrong
[01:16:35] <Abbas-> the script is in /scripts (loading with indexphp)
[01:16:37] <Cork> check your error console then
[01:16:38] <Abbas-> the images are in /images
[01:16:48] <Abbas-> no errors
[01:16:52] <Abbas-> so its either teh css
[01:16:55] <Abbas-> withing js
[01:17:02] <Cork> does it list network activity?
[01:18:40] <Abbas-> im using firebug
[01:18:47] <Abbas-> the console page is empty no errors
[01:18:53] <Abbas-> don't know hwo to chekc network activit
[01:18:53] <Cork> check the net tab then
[01:18:57] <Abbas-> ok
[01:18:58] <Cork> see if the image is requested
[01:19:53] <Abbas-> yes i can see style.css callin git
[01:19:58] <Abbas-> i need to disable the iamge from style.css
[01:20:02] <Abbas-> and see if the script calls it
[01:20:18] <Cork> no not css

[01:21:58] <nathanb> silly question anyone used phphaml ?
[01:22:11] <Abbas-> the hover's 2nd part is working though , the part the 'removes' the background on hover out
[01:22:24] <Abbas-> this > http://pastebin.com/CXsEYSzC
[01:23:23] <Cork> Abbas-: and if you replace the background-image with something like 'background-color', 'red'
[01:23:25] <Cork> does that work?
[01:24:05] <Abbas-> nope
[01:24:24] <Abbas-> can you please see if i m messing with the wrong 'parent'. http://pastebin.com/CXsEYSzC
[01:24:31] <Abbas-> i want the li background to be modified
[01:25:11] <Cork> Abbas-: if i'm to see anything you would have to make a demo
[01:25:20] <Abbas-> ok im uploading these
[01:25:23] <Cork> Abbas-: its imposible to debug a dead code dump
[01:25:33] <Cork> ?demo

[01:26:20] <fRAiLtY-> When I click on a drop-down here http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing it unregisters/turns off the more/less jQuery just above in the top paragraph, why?
[01:27:24] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: more less jquery?
[01:28:40] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Visit the site, look at the top paragraph, see the more link, it's an expander. It works great but when you then select something in the drop-downs below it removes it completely. Try it.

[01:29:53] <Cork> ah...

[01:30:38] <Abbas-> the carrot v trinagle is what im trying to set via js
[01:31:41] <Abbas-> the code is in custom-js.js

[01:33:41] <Abbas-> ok color: red appleis now
[01:33:46] <Abbas-> gonna change to image-background
[01:34:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: could you point me at where the more comes from?
[01:35:25] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: It's in the top paragraph of text, the lorem ipsum...
[01:35:33] <fRAiLtY-> Little pink link at the end
[01:35:41] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i meant the code
[01:35:50] <Cork> something addeds it through js
[01:35:59] <fRAiLtY-> 2 secs
[01:36:28] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: 				jQuery('div.short-description').expander({
[01:36:28] <fRAiLtY-> 					slicePoint: 600,
[01:36:29] <fRAiLtY-> 					expandText: 'more..',
[01:36:29] <fRAiLtY-> 					userCollapseText: 'hide..'
[01:36:29] <fRAiLtY-> 				});
[01:37:03] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ok, and when you change the select element you place the text?
[01:37:41] <fRAiLtY-> If I alter the select element the expander part disappears, in that it truncates the text currently for page layout purposes, once a select is selected this goes and all text is displayed.
[01:38:33] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that doesn't answer my question >_>
[01:38:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: do you replace the text?
[01:38:50] <fRAiLtY-> What text?
[01:39:30] <Abbas-> Cork where did you see that if statement error. my console was showing blank the whole time
[01:39:37] <Abbas-> im curious if i m mmissing other error message too
[01:39:39] <Cork> the text under the flyer printing
[01:39:51] <fRAiLtY-> The text doesn't get replaced no, it's just static
[01:39:53] <Cork> Abbas-: its in my error console
[01:40:03] <fRAiLtY-> Just the expander effects the div
[01:40:05] <Abbas-> are you using firebug?
[01:40:08] <fRAiLtY-> The selects aren't related
[01:40:21] <Xotix> How do i bind an message event to jquery? e.g. window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);
[01:40:22] <Cork> Abbas-: yes, combined with the built in error console
[01:40:26] <Xotix> *with
[01:40:37] <Abbas-> ah firebug seems buggy its stil shwoing blank
[01:40:42] <Abbas-> chrom's firebug shows teh error
[01:40:58] <Cork> Xotix: $(window).bind('message', function() {})
[01:41:15] <Cork> Xotix: though you most likly want to use the native listner
[01:41:29] <asher^> is there a way i can $.post both serialised data and objects at the same time?
[01:41:34] <Cork> Xotix: jquery will rewrite the parameters in a way thats suboptimal
[01:42:11] <zef88> why isnt this working?       $('div.baseball').each( function(i){      $(this).delay(500 * (i+1)).fadeIn(200);   });
[01:42:29] <Trisox> hahah omg clients and slide shows bad idea.. 12 slides a page 6.6 mb a picture total of 78.2 mb a page hahaha
[01:43:50] <Xotix> Cork, i don't understand this. Wouldn't that be triggered by any message event/any postMessage done? I can't use teh native, can't fix it for ie.Tried http://tinyw.in/hCxW but ie still throws the error, it doesn't know addEventListener and seems to stop there.
[01:44:35] <Cork> Xotix: use attachEvent on ie
[01:44:53] <zef88> why isnt this working?       $('div.baseball').each( function(i){      $(this).delay(500 * (i+1)).fadeIn(200);   });        ** It doesn't do the delay :(
[01:45:37] <Xotix> Cork, thats what i tried. Wanted to detect like if (!someElement.addEventListener) and then use attachEvent instead but it gives an error because of the if, which stops the script. Do i have to use $.browser?
[01:46:21] <wltoriginal> zef88: i is an index .. not sure what you are trying to do
[01:47:40] <zef88> wltoriginal: I have a set of divs of class "baseball" I'm trying to make them disappear one after the other
[01:47:43] <Cork> Xotix: whats the error?
[01:48:12] <aquareality> my page currenty loads content via php files + page refresh.. I would like jQuery to 'slide' the content in without page refresh
[01:48:42] <zef88> wltoriginal: I know it's an index, Im multiplying it times 500 ms so that each following div waits longer than the last one before disappearing
[01:52:26] <wltoriginal> zef88: try $('div.baseball').each( function(i){ $(this).hide(); } in console. Then run $('div.baseball').each( function(i){ $(this).show(); }. What happens?
[01:52:58] <fRAiLtY-> cork ^^
[01:53:07] <wltoriginal> oops typo : $('div.baseball').each( function(i){ $(this).hide(); }); then $('div.baseball').each( function(i){ $(this).show(); });
[01:53:38] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what?
[01:53:52] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I explained above regarding the selects
[01:54:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: do you ever replace the html content?
[01:54:40] <Cork> i'm not asking about the event listners
[01:54:58] <Xotix> Cork, somehow the detection works now. Hmm, must have been some different problem. Anyway, now it uses attachEvent, but my function never gets called. window.attachEvent("message", receiveMessage); in ie8. what I'm missing?
[01:55:04] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: No, not as far as I'm aware.
[01:55:33] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/WaiS7MSy
[01:57:28] <Xotix> ah in ie its the onmessage event :)
[01:58:03] <Nece228> anyone knows why this doesnt select the button?
[01:58:05] <Nece228> $('button').click(function()
[01:58:15] <Xotix> thx cork
[01:58:16] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: prototype replaces the short-description element when you change the dropdown
[01:58:17] <Nece228> the html is like this
[01:58:19] <Nece228> <button id="1">Delete Entry</button>
[01:58:26] <asher^> is there a way i can $.post both serialised data and objects at the same time?
[02:00:19] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: line 242 in scp_product_extensions.js
[02:00:31] <zef88> wltoriginal: hid them all, then showed them all
[02:03:17] <wltoriginal> zef88: now try $('div.baseball').each( function(i){ $(this).hide().delay(1000).show(); }) what happens?
[02:03:41] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: How to make this not happen? scp_product_extension shouldn't touch short-description?
[02:03:42] <Trisox> Xotix: any luck yet?
[02:04:07] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: not sure what that file is, but it matches it
[02:04:20] <Xotix> yes. The iframe trick and postMessage() to get an answer works in all modern browser.
[02:04:52] <fRAiLtY-> So look for short-description in scpâ€¦.js
[02:05:17] <Cork> sure and it exists on line 242
[02:06:30] <Trisox> Xotix: nice
[02:06:59] <Xotix> Trisox but there is no magic about this. Its very simple.
[02:09:46] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Commented out and works great, ta. One more thing. If you operate the expander (more/hide) you notice the transition is quite awkward, what causes this?
[02:09:52] <fRAiLtY-> Sort of flicks and jitters a bit
[02:09:56] <fRAiLtY-> Not very smooth
[02:21:16] <foofoobar> Hi
[02:21:30] <foofoobar> I've added a keydown handler on my $(document) which works like it should
[02:21:46] <foofoobar> Now if I take the same code and change keydown to keyup, I assumed that it will be called when I release the key
[02:21:50] <foofoobar> but just nothing happens
[02:21:51] <foofoobar> Why?
[02:23:08] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: ^^
[02:31:30] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you have two elements, and you first hide the first one, then animate out the second
[02:31:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that will cause a jurky movment
[02:31:42] <fRAiLtY-> :/
[02:32:10] <Cork> in other words more doens't just show the missing text
[02:32:17] <Cork> it replaces the entire element
[02:32:32] <Cork> .summary vs .details
[02:33:08] <fRAiLtY-> So to make it smoother it's like an entire new method
[02:33:55] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i would prob have wrapped the part i want to expand inline instead
[02:34:10] <Cork> and expand that
[02:34:23] <Cork> (and then hide the ...)
[02:36:46] <fRAiLtY-> Is this possible with the script I have
[02:36:49] <fRAiLtY-> I just downloaded it you see
[02:36:58] <Cork> no clue
[02:40:44] <Twilo> how can I find out whether a click event is present or how can i overwriting a click event?
[02:44:08] <nFFF> .data('events')
[02:44:31] <Cork> i think that changed in ff1.7 or 1.6
[02:45:21] <spacemonkey> Hey everyone! Can I find help with pjax here, or is there another channel I should look at?
[02:46:15] <diverdude> hi
[02:46:17] <diverdude>  anybody in here ever managed to upload files using XMLHttpRequest ?
[02:46:56] <Cork> diverdude: the browser needs to support the new file api
[02:47:10] <diverdude> Corey: yes....chrome and FF does
[02:47:17] <Cork> http://caniuse.com/fileapi
[02:47:19] <diverdude> Cork: ^
[02:48:28] <diverdude> Cork: i cannot make it work on chrome 17 which should be supported

[02:51:04] <Hippie_> <3 jquery
[02:51:28] <spacemonkey> Hippie_: Same here, just not able to get my head wrapped around pjax :-(
[02:52:28] <spacemonkey> Direct URL loads in 1 second, onClick loads through pjax take 4. Anybody know where to start with pjax and latency issues?
[02:54:01] <aqeel> hi room
[02:54:06] <nFFF> pjax is just ajax aqnd push state?
[02:55:14] <spacemonkey> Yup.
[02:56:28] <spacemonkey> I think the difference is somewhere in the push and location updates, but I'm not sure.
[02:56:37] <spacemonkey> I'm a server-side guy, and this is all voodoo to me.
[02:56:44] * spacemonkey blushes just a bit inside his spacehelmet
[02:57:10] <nFFF> Server side??? get outta here
[02:57:28] <spacemonkey> Shouldn't be three full seconds though, should actually be less due to partial-vs-refresh
[02:57:39] <nFFF> TBH I have no experience with it, Ive read about it and seen the demo
[02:57:46] <nFFF> Not sure exactly it is
[02:57:58] <nFFF> IT partially reloads the page via AJAX and updates the URL?
[02:58:01] <spacemonkey> Looking for websites that are using it, beyond the three page static demo...
[02:58:08] <spacemonkey> Yup.
[02:58:23] <nFFF> I think Highrise basecampo from 37signals use it
[02:58:26] <spacemonkey> We got the partials running fast, when you request them directly they are lickety-split.
[02:58:43] <spacemonkey> So the only place left to look is pjax (and our implementation).
[02:59:02] <spacemonkey> We're jquery rookies, so my stomach tells me we did something RONG.
[02:59:05] <spacemonkey> ;-)
[03:00:35] <nFFF> I dont really understand it or the big fuss
[03:00:43] <nFFF> Whats the pros?
[03:00:45] <spacemonkey> For us it is for a persistent media player.
[03:00:46] <nFFF> sell it to me
[03:01:05] <spacemonkey> We need to keep that "app" running while the site visitor cruises the platform.
[03:01:22] <nFFF> So your loading new content around the app?
[03:01:31] <spacemonkey> Will also use it for monster file uploads, as it is for the music industry. Bands will be uploading 50MB WAV files for digital distribution, for example.
[03:01:36] <spacemonkey> Yup.
[03:01:44] <nFFF> But you can use normal AJAX for that
[03:01:50] <barh> on jquery mobile, i made search input, how do i make it work? any reference?
[03:01:51] <nFFF> wheres the pros of this pjax shit
[03:01:51] <barh> i found nothing
[03:02:33] <nFFF> ?jquerymobile @ barh

[03:03:12] <spacemonkey> nFFF: Not trying to sell anyone on pjax, trying to get help making it work :-)
[03:03:41] <nFFF> I know I was just interested to its pros
[03:03:49] <nFFF> and why your using it over normal AJAX?
[03:04:31] <spacemonkey> pjax was supposed to make it easy. Starting to think otherwise.
[03:04:51] <spacemonkey> Have any good references on how to accomplish something similar with stock AJAX?
[03:05:06] <lijzz> i need an image slider with next and previous button, start and stop slide show, able to set starting slide. the images should be aligned vertically as well as horizontally center
[03:05:08] <spacemonkey> Again, we're rookies, be gentle. :-)
[03:05:37] <lijzz> spacemonkey u hav any knows plugins?
[03:05:40] <nFFF> spacemonkey, if you just want to load dynamic content to the page without refreshing the page, this is what AJAX is for
[03:05:44] <lijzz> dont say google
[03:06:03] <nFFF> You can load specific parts of a new page into the current one using the .load() method
[03:06:24] <lijzz>  i need an image slider with next and previous button, start and stop slide show, able to set starting slide. the images should be aligned vertically as well as horizontally center
[03:06:28] <nFFF> $('.this-element').load('some-page.html #this-element');
[03:06:43] <nFFF> This will load #this-element from within /some-page.html
[03:06:50] <lijzz> i tried slidesjs.com
[03:06:52] <nFFF> into the current DOM
[03:07:14] <nFFF> If you want to replace content you can use $.get() and within the your success callback use .replaceWith
[03:07:15] <nFFF> etc
[03:07:16] <lijzz> but the images are not aligning cenetered
[03:08:02] <spacemonkey> nFFF: what about browser history?
[03:08:15] <barh> is there any possible to export "jquery search input" to GET or POST method?
[03:08:45] <nFFF> spacemonkey, yea thats where pjax might come in
[03:08:54] <nFFF> I forgot it saves history
[03:08:55] <lijzz> nff help
[03:09:06] <cil> hi everyone
[03:09:12] <lijzz> haalla
[03:09:21] <spacemonkey> lijzz: are you building your own app, or using a platform/framework?
[03:09:35] <nFFF> thats what pushState is for
[03:09:41] <lijzz> spacemonkey my own app
[03:09:57] <lijzz> actually i am working in asp.net mvc
[03:10:04] <lijzz> but i want an image slider
[03:10:10] <lijzz> in jquery
[03:10:18] <lijzz> with next and previous button, start and stop slide show, able to set starting slide. the images should be aligned vertically as well as horizontally center
[03:10:28] <cil> i'm using jquery to load content to an div but after load on one site the css gets broken.. anybody an idea ? or have time to quick look at the site ? :)
[03:10:58] <spacemonkey> lijxx: This article is only a couple months old, you checked these out? http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/02/jquery-image-slider-plugins.html
[03:11:26] <spacemonkey> nFFF: pushState?
[03:11:38] <lijzz> spacemonkey did u see SLIDES in that
[03:11:43] <lijzz> i was using that
[03:11:51] <cil> it's the index site so on the firts time you load the page everything is finde but fter reloading the site with ajax the ccs gets broken...
[03:12:10] <nFFF> spacemonkey, pjax = pushState + AJAX
[03:12:31] <nFFF> pushState allows you to pragmattically add states to history on site
[03:13:22] <spacemonkey> nFFF: Got you. Managing history is really good with pjax, that was a major feature for us.
[03:13:33] <spacemonkey> Having trouble finding people for help though.
[03:13:47] <spacemonkey> I wonder if we would have been better off rolling our own and learning the hard/good way.
[03:13:58] <spacemonkey> Now we're dependent on it, and need help.
[03:14:01] * spacemonkey listens to crickets
[03:14:02] <spacemonkey> hehe
[03:14:30] <nFFF> spacemonkey the thing is, it wouldn't be hard to implement yourself, I doubt many in here have used the PJAX plugin
[03:14:31] <Nucky> So what would be the difference between using PJAX and just rolling with pushState + AJAX?
[03:14:44] <nFFF> Nucky, PJAX is just a plugin
[03:14:53] <nFFF> That is basically what you said
[03:14:55] <nFFF> :|
[03:15:10] <nFFF> Why use any plugin when you can just roll with x + y.. :>
[03:15:32] <spacemonkey> The plugin was a shortcut. And you know what I mean when I say "shortcut" right?
[03:16:14] <Julien`> Hello everbody
[03:16:15] <spacemonkey> The difference is that we used pjax and can't find any help, and probably would have done ourselves a favor by learning on our own and just rocking with pushState+AJAX.
[03:16:29] <Julien`> Can i use defered with appended elements ?
[03:16:30] * spacemonkey high fives julien`
[03:16:40] <Julien`> i want to be sure elememnt
[03:17:07] <Julien`> i want to be sure that element are appended before doing something
[03:17:11] <nFFF> Julien`, You can use deferreds whenever you want
[03:17:17] <nFFF> but appending is not asynch
[03:17:21] <nFFF> so not sure why youd need to
[03:17:42] <Julien`> i'm using masonry
[03:18:10] <Julien`> and i want to be sire that elements are appended before doiunf '.mesonry('reload') ....
[03:18:15] <Julien`> *sure
[03:18:21] <Julien`> *doing
[03:18:32] <nFFF> So do
[03:19:09] <nFFF> if ($('.foo').length) $('.bar').mesonry('reload')
[03:19:29] <Julien`> nFFF: i was thinking about this, thanks a lot :)
[03:19:52] <Julien`> and using setTimeout for waiting
[03:20:29] <nFFF> Im not sure what masonry is
[03:20:42] <nFFF> So I cant really give much practical advice
[03:21:38] <Nucky> Yeah nFFF, you're right, but my point is: if I'm having latency issues using pjax, what could be different with pushState + ajax? I'd load the same content in my container...
[03:22:19] <nFFF> What latency issues are you having
[03:22:36] <nFFF> PJAX is a wrapper around pushstate and ajax
[03:23:26] <nFFF> So youd most likely think that your ajax requests where the issue
[03:24:23] <Nucky> Yeah, probably. Might be the content, something improperly loaded.
[03:24:25] <farhad2161> how can i change numbers from english to arabic when page loaded completely?for example change 3 to ?
[03:24:41] <nFFF> Nucky, Id got over exactly what the server is returning
[03:24:45] <nFFF> is it returning data you don't need?
[03:25:01] <nFFF> Then look more deep towards your server load, connection speed etc
[03:25:59] <Nucky> We're requesting and getting entire views and replacing the html of a container div. That makes me think if we're not asking too much :)
[03:27:12] <New0> Trisox, hi here?
[03:28:09] <farhad2161> how can i change numbers from english to arabic when page loaded completely?for example change 3 to ?
[03:29:17] <BeingSimon> Any central repository location for the jquery UI??

[03:33:52] <BeingSimon> hey New0 can this be used withour downloading it on the server
[03:35:06] <New0> BeingSimon, *withour?
[03:35:43] <New0> BeingSimon, sorry can you repeate your Q? tnx
[03:35:51] <BeingSimon> sorry *without
[03:36:52] <BeingSimon> All I want to know is can I use it like a public repository(giving the web reference)
[03:37:10] <New0> BeingSimon, ah well i 'm not sure. i know jQuery can be usge link CND
[03:38:12] <New0> BeingSimon, i think this is the A? http://jqueryui.com/docs/Subversion
[03:39:10] <BeingSimon> Thankyou very much New0 I will give it a shot
[03:39:26] <New0> sure BeingSimon np :)
[03:39:59] <barh> is there anyone here experienced with jquery mobile search?
[03:40:46] <nFFF> farhad2161, youd have to iterate over the document and test each character
[03:40:53] <nFFF> afaik the DOM treats everything as a string
[03:41:02] <New0> BeingSimon, hoo find for you i think http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-1-8-2-released
[03:41:02] <nFFF> so Im not sure if theres an easy way
[03:42:31] <farhad2161> nFFF: can u give me a simple sample
[03:42:50] <nFFF> Im not even sure you strings are mutable
[03:42:56] <barh> is there anyone here experienced with jquery mobile search?
[03:43:02] <New0> BeingSimon, ?
[03:43:06] <nFFF> it would be easy to sto str[i] = 'arabic number'
[03:43:10] <nFFF> but dont think you can :D
[03:44:46] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/wPGKv/
[03:44:54] <nFFF> I started it for you
[03:44:58] <farhad2161> nFFF: $(window).load(function() { document.body.innerHTML=fixNumber(document.body.innerHTML); });
[03:45:35] <nFFF> ?
[03:45:40] <nFFF> whats that?
[03:45:57] <nFFF> why you paste it to me ? :<
[03:46:47] <Hookah> $("#slider-range").each(function() {
[03:46:52] <Hookah> why would this only hit the first one?
[03:46:58] <Hookah> $(".sliders").each(function() {
[03:47:01] <Hookah> this would hit all of them
[03:47:13] <Hookah> and yes, i have more than #silder-range
[03:47:17] <Hookah> i mean more than one
[03:47:50] <ussher_> with JSON, is "messages": [],  the same as "messages": {},  meaning an empty set?
[03:48:18] <nFFF> Hookah, thats invalid HTML
[03:48:23] <nFFF> id's are meant to be unique
[03:48:39] <nFFF> I suggest re-approaching the way you've written your markup
[03:49:42] <Hookah> okay
[03:50:52] <NodeX> page rank update finaly
[03:54:33] <spacemonkey> nFFF: The problem wasn't pjax, the views were returning the entire document, and jquery had to parse the entire DOM to get to the container we wanted updated.
[03:54:40] <spacemonkey> Glad to finally figure this out.
[03:54:46] <spacemonkey> So maybe pjax ain't so bad after all. :-)
[03:56:39] <nFFF> No one said it was bad :S
[03:56:57] <nFFF> its jsut a wrapper around ajax :)
[04:12:36] <Xotix> is it bad to do functions within my plugin? http://pastebin.com/5gJZppbS

[04:36:14] <wild_oscar> how do I do it? with .delegate() ?
[04:39:09] <xec> wild_oscar: with a delegate you can avoid the need to rebind
[04:39:40] <xec> wild_oscar: you can bind to a (static) parent element and supply a selector
[04:39:43] <vladimir> i have a problem guys, hope someone can help me out. i have a dialog that is positioned relative to a div with a unique id="position1" . i have js function that hides and shows different content on page including that div. when i hide content that contains div=position1, and then show different div which has the same div=position1 included, jquery doesnt recognize it anymore. it positions dialog
[04:39:44] <vladimir> on top of the page even though a div=position1 is present on page - its just not thesame one. it seems that array of dom objects that was created on page load , does not include that hidden content. is there any way to reinitialise jquery dom array so it "sees" that element?
[04:40:20] <wild_oscar> xec: trying that, lets see
[04:40:36] <xec> wild_oscar: but in order to give you anything specific i'd need to see your html. in any case see the section on delegates, see ?on
[04:40:37] <bot-t> wild_oscar, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:40:53] <Xotix> if i do $('#someDiv').plugin(); and within my plugin i do console.log($(this));  shoudln't it print my div?
[04:41:45] <wild_oscar> xec: I do need to upgrade my jquery, I'm on 1.4
[04:41:45] <xec> wild_oscar: by static i mean a permanent element that does not get overwritten by your ajax callback
[04:42:22] <xec> wild_oscar: if you're on 1.4 i would recommend an upgrade yes, but you could see ?live
[04:42:24] <bot-t> wild_oscar, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[04:42:25] <wild_oscar> xec: so, in any case, $("#singleAnswerAudit").delegate(".pagelinks a", "click", function() {...} would not work, because of the remove() it
[04:42:37] <sqwk> What is the best way to shrink-wrap a select's width to the currently selected option
[04:42:52] <sqwk> I.e. can I get the width of an option?
[04:43:23] <DeltaHeavy> sqwk: $('#stuff').width();
[04:43:26] <xec> wild_oscar: right, delegate also exists in 1.4
[04:43:36] <sqwk> deltaHeavy: that returns 0
[04:43:58] <xec> well, 1.4.2
[04:44:03] <DeltaHeavy> sqwk: There must be another issue then because I'm currently using it myself.
[04:44:17] <DeltaHeavy> What element are you trying to use it on?
[04:44:49] <sqwk> <option>
[04:44:53] <sqwk> inside a select
[04:45:03] <xec> wild_oscar: right, you would need a higher parent if its removed.
[04:45:20] <libin> how do we write a jquery function in a js file.. the name of the jquery function need to be AppViewModel
[04:45:22] <DeltaHeavy> Try putting it inside a div without any CSS or anything then find the width of that div.
[04:45:27] <libin> here is my sample code http://pastebin.com/ngnYDiHP
[04:46:07] <wild_oscar> xec: btw, the scenario is: I'm using cluetip on an href that calls for an ajax function. the tooltip shows a paginated table. when I click the 2nd page link, I want the tooltip's contents to be updated
[04:47:25] <xec> i haven't heard of cluetip before, but it might be easier to understand if you can whip up a little fiddle
[04:48:21] <Xotix> xec, what is more correct: http://pastebin.com/1UmpNrMf or just put the foo(9 function within the anonymouse plugin function without the global var?
[04:50:01] <xec> i'm not sure what you mean by "foo(9 function within the anonymouse"
[04:50:08] <wild_oscar> xec: hmm...how do I do it with an ajax function?
[04:50:15] <Xotix> within $.fn.ajaxUpload = function(options) {
[04:51:14] <sqwk> DeltaHeavy: that would work. The problem is that I am trying to get the width of a ui-element
[04:51:43] <xec> wild_oscar: fake it! :) with a settimeout if you want to accurately simulate. there is also support for echo requests at jsfiddle.net
[04:52:34] <xec> Xotix: i don't get the question
[04:53:16] <xec> Xotix: are you asking if the function needs to be within the plugin code? if so, no
[04:53:49] <Xotix> xec, i just want to have $this within my functions, should i create a global, like i did in the exmaple?
[04:53:50] <vladimir> is it possible to position a dialog relative to a element which is hidden on page load?
[04:54:43] <xec> Xotix: you declared $this inside a function, so it's not a global
[04:55:38] <xec> Xotix: also, "this" is already a jquery object/collection - you don't need to wrap it in $(this)
[04:55:52] <Xotix> xec $this = this?
[04:56:01] <xec> right
[04:56:05] <Xotix> ok
[04:56:23] <Xotix> but if i have several functiosn outside of my plugin how should i make $this accsesable?
[04:56:47] <xec> but if your function needs access to variables in a scope, you could just put the function in the same scope
[04:56:56] <xec> or you can pass it as a parameter
[04:57:14] <DeltaHeavy> sqwk: Perhaps try '$('#option').css('width')'? If that doesn't work try setting the element's CSS to what it actually is in your CSS.
[04:57:17] <xec> or like you did, cache it in a higher scope
[04:57:39] <Xotix> xec parameters :P hmm okay thanks a lot
[04:58:47] <xec> Xotix: like, if your function requires a dom element, it makes sense to make it obvious by doing function doSomethingWith(element) { ... }
[04:59:41] <Xotix> xec yeah, but i'm used to the style of having a class and doing some "global" vars which i use often. anyway you helped me thanks :)
[05:00:12] <Hippie_> <a href="#" class="next">Next Step</a>                           $('a.next').click();
[05:00:17] <Hippie_> doesnt work, help?
[05:02:05] <ChoiZ> what do you want to do "onclick" ?
[05:02:37] <Hippie_> function() { alert('asd'); }
[05:03:00] <ChoiZ> $('a.next').click(function() { alert('test'); });
[05:03:09] <ChoiZ> doesn't works?
[05:04:29] <Hippie_> nope
[05:04:45] <Hippie_> page just jumps to top
[05:05:00] <ChoiZ> do you have load jquery ?
[05:05:10] <ChoiZ> i've try it and it's works well
[05:05:24] <Hippie_> $(document).ready(function () {
[05:05:29] <Hippie_> that?
[05:05:32] <ChoiZ> nop
[05:05:57] <ChoiZ> something like : <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[05:06:05] <Hippie_> indeed
[05:06:36] <Hippie_> hah
[05:07:13] <Hippie_> fixed :)
[05:07:16] <shownet> http://jsfiddle.net/theshown/mnJyb/ how to solve this?
[05:07:34] <ChoiZ> http://jsbin.com/ifilah/edit#javascript,html
[05:07:57] <Hippie_> tx
[05:07:59] <ChoiZ> hÃ©hÃ© lol Hippie_ ;)
[05:08:02] <ChoiZ> easy :)
[05:08:09] <Hippie_> shownet, what do you want firxed?
[05:08:21] <Hippie_> oh
[05:08:22] <kevwilde> http://dpaste.com/742591/ < i get an illegal invocation. what am i doing wrong?
[05:08:34] <shownet> style of the old button get scrambled after changing text
[05:09:33] <Hippie_> shownet .. who taught you jquery?
[05:09:36] <shownet> but that does not happen for a new appended button. i've been messing around with refresh methods and things like that but nothing seemed to work. i am missing something
[05:10:10] <ChoiZ> kevwilde: maybe it doesn't like username: username no?
[05:10:27] <ChoiZ> password: password it's ambigous
[05:10:31] <ChoiZ> (for me)
[05:10:39] <Hippie_> shownet, i dont follow
[05:10:40] <Hippie_> http://jsfiddle.net/theshown/mnJyb/
[05:10:53] <kevwilde> ChoiZ: ok, i'll look into that
[05:10:59] <ChoiZ> maybe :s
[05:11:25] <ChoiZ> and add console.log('test'); in your success function
[05:11:34] <ChoiZ> maybe first replace the variable name
[05:11:53] <kevwilde> i did, still same error
[05:13:32] <ChoiZ> kevwilde: which one?
[05:13:45] <kevwilde> Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[05:13:56] <ChoiZ> :/
[05:13:58] <kevwilde> on the $.ajax line
[05:14:20] <kevwilde> do i need to include jquery again in that js file to use it?
[05:14:21] <ChoiZ> try on http://jsbin.com/
[05:14:30] <ChoiZ> yep
[05:14:37] <ChoiZ> $.ajax it's from jQuery
[05:14:45] <ChoiZ> so you need jQuery.js
[05:15:04] <kevwilde> what i pasted is in a seperate .js file
[05:15:16] <kevwilde> but the jquery file itself is loaded first on the web page
[05:15:19] <ChoiZ> if you've got your.js
[05:15:30] <ChoiZ> you must have jquery.js load before your.js ;)
[05:16:38] <coldhead> ?lint
[05:16:39] <bot-t> if you're bored waiting for someone to fix your broken code you can always try to find the problem yourself by pasting it into http://jsHint.com/
[05:27:16] <shownet> ops Hippie_ didn't see
[05:27:30] <shownet> what's the problem?
[05:27:52] <shownet> haven't spent many hours behind jquery mobile
[05:28:16] <Xotix> I'm using a plugin on a div called foo. within the plugin, i'm moving the div to another position, clone it and retur the clone to its old position. now, the plugin isn't assigned anymore to that new cloned div. How can i prevent that?
[05:31:39] <austinallen> is their a live javascript editor similar to google docs?
[05:31:58] <austinallen> that the code can be updated live?
[05:32:15] <quicksilver> jsfiddle, austinallen
[05:32:40] <austinallen> Oh, JSfiddle updated code live while you are typing it?
[05:32:45] <DeltaHeavy> Is there anyway to get around jQuery's auto closing of elements?
[05:33:54] <quicksilver> austinallen: well not sure about "live"
[05:33:56] <quicksilver> you have to click run
[05:34:04] <austinallen> ahh..
[05:34:14] <quicksilver> but then when you're typing code it's normally a typo until you close that last )
[05:34:45] <austinallen> Well, i am looking for updating the code live so other people can view me typing...
[05:34:58] <austinallen> Sorta like Sync.in and Google Docs
[05:35:42] <auska> if i have a function foo(a) {} can I do something like function foo(a = true) {} so when i do foo() a is true and when i do foo(0) , foo is false?
[05:36:00] <Xotix> if i apply a plugin to a html element and then clone it does its clone have it as well?
[05:40:52] <coldhead> depends on the plugin, Xotix
[05:40:54] <coldhead> ?tias
[05:40:54] <bot-t> Try It And See
[05:41:43] <Xotix> coldhead i'm writing it myself so how can i achieve that? i thought i just can set a marker, e.g. a div, and clone the element i've taken and replace it.
[05:43:14] <coldhead> if you use the option arg to clone you will get the events http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[05:43:31] <coldhead> and then you just have to write your handlers carefully to not depend on a particular instance
[05:43:34] <walidvb> what size do i need to give my body so that it fits the screen's size on a mobile?
[05:43:50] <coldhead> 900px, walidvb
[05:44:04] <walidvb> coldhead: wide?
[05:44:17] <coldhead> right
[05:44:20] <coldhead> and 100% height
[05:44:35] <walidvb> let me try
[05:45:04] <Xotix> coldhead ok i^ll try
[05:45:27] <walidvb> if i put 900px wide, i can scroll horizontally
[05:45:51] <walidvb> i want to avoid that, building a prototype of an app in html, should be simply fullscreen
[05:46:20] <coldhead> width: 100%?
[05:46:35] <chopkorn> i only get object object returned when doing alert("input").attr("name"));
[05:46:47] <walidvb> same.. :( been playing around with a lot of solutions, it's really not so easy!
[05:47:05] <Xotix> coldhead does replaceWidth maybe just take the html without events etc?
[05:47:37] <coldhead> possibly Xotix, i've never tried it
[05:47:46] <coldhead> mobile is hard, walidvb
[05:47:56] <walidvb> coldhead: i can still scroll. i did put initial-scale=1 and max-scale=1, though.
[05:48:06] <lijzz> hothead
[05:48:30] <coldhead> walidvb: maybe take a look at how jQuery mobile styles their page, it looks pretty good everywhere
[05:50:32] <walidvb> good idea
[05:50:33] <walidvb> thanks
[05:50:56] <KiiK> Hi, why resizeable doesn't work after drag the object ?? http://jsfiddle.net/H25dx/
[05:53:09] <coldhead> KiiK: you might need to apply resizeable() again after you drop
[05:54:21] <KiiK> coldhead: any example. I tried add resizable() to drag / stop event but doesn't work.
[05:56:16] <walidvb> coldhead:     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
[05:56:21] <coldhead> i can't find an example sorry KiiK
[05:56:22] <walidvb> that did it \o/
[05:56:28] <coldhead> good work walidvb!
[05:57:42] <walidvb> now i just need at some point to make a web-app of it to remove toolbars, but getting there
[05:57:43] <walidvb> :)
[05:57:47] <walidvb> thanks!
[05:58:57] <Xotix> how is it possible that this http://pastebin.com/3iKVevi2 returns me the input with the new id which i change later as the console log is?
[05:59:01] <juha_> coldhead: !
[05:59:10] <Xotix> var fileInput = $(this);
[06:02:50] <pachet> Xotix: because console.log links to that object by reference
[06:03:02] <Xotix> pachet ah
[06:03:08] <pachet> so updating that reference, as long as you dont reassign it, will be updated in console
[06:03:23] <pachet> (there are some envs where that's not true, and console will print a heap snapshot at the time of call)
[06:03:54] <pachet> (also i think most console implementations cache the heap obj value when you click through to it, but not before)
[06:04:07] <Xotix> thanks pachet
[06:04:12] <walidvb> coldhead: now it's the height I have problems with ^^
[06:05:05] <walidvb> about to do a simple $body.height($window.height)
[06:05:07] <walidvb> :D
[06:10:55] <sqwk> how can I get the shrink-wrap a select to it's minimum width without cutting off text?
[06:14:47] <Xotix> var x = fileInput.after('foo'); is x a reference to fileInput and not to the element created by after?
[06:15:40] <quicksilver> yes
[06:15:58] <quicksilver> on the other hand
[06:16:05] <Xotix> ahh now, but with next() i'll get foo
[06:16:11] <Xotix> that'd make sense
[06:16:12] <quicksilver> $('<foo/>').insertAfter(fileInput)
[06:18:07] <Xotix> quicksivler true. so fileInput.after(fileInput.clone()).next(); vs fileInput.clone().insertAfter(fileInput); :P i like your one better thanks a lot
[06:19:01] <Xotix> perfect

[07:36:12] <fAntomeL> quicksilver ok now seems the php doesn't fire any error but seems that still doesn't parse the data from productId any advices how can i see what ajax parses ?
[07:37:46] <Hooloovoo> velcrobots: yup
[07:37:56] <velcrobots> do i need to use .stop?
[07:38:11] <Hooloovoo> velcrobots: because the div you have get's overlayed with another div
[07:38:19] <Hooloovoo> so it triggers as the mouse leaves the div
[07:38:20] <Hooloovoo> a sec
[07:39:16] <Hooloovoo> hmmm waiit
[07:39:17] <Hooloovoo> no
[07:40:37] <Hooloovoo> velcrobots: here we go http://jsfiddle.net/hu3Pz/3/
[07:41:08] <velcrobots> so instead of over and out it's enter and leave huh
[07:41:13] <Hooloovoo> yup
[07:41:20] <velcrobots> i'll google the difference
[07:41:24] <velcrobots> thanks for your help
[07:41:24] <Hooloovoo> read the documentation for them and you'll see why =)

[07:41:34] <venus_> hello, how can i add a div element before a div using jquery
[07:42:47] <pachet> $(foo).before('<div/>')
[07:44:53] <venus_> pachet that is for me ?
[07:46:45] <pachet> venus_: yes
[07:47:58] <venus_> what if i want to insert <div id="one"> before <div id="two">
[07:49:03] <freeed> Hi all.. does anyone know how I can use the swipeleft and swiperight events in jquery mobile in a normal jquery website? When I include jquery mobile it takes over my site - adding a loading animation and binding classes to my dom - I just want to use those 2 events :\ any ideas?
[07:49:11] <Jon47> venus_ it depends on whether they exist already or not, do you want to create the elements or just move around existing elements?
[07:49:15] <pachet> venus_: $('#two').before('#one')
[07:49:38] <pachet> $('#one').insertBefore('#two')
[07:53:08] <venus_> jon: div id="two" exists
[07:54:42] <venus_> i have used the same code pachet, but it isnt doing it
[07:54:42] <venus_> http://pastebin.com/TAnyecda
[07:57:42] <bsilwal> I need a jquery to close a modal dialog to use in selenium test. any idea please.

[08:01:49] <silverlining> how do i get all the values from a table?
[08:02:03] <silverlining> i need to do an async post of my table data
[08:02:04] <venus_> here is the site
[08:02:05] <venus_> http://cam.outsourcejobstome.com/
[08:02:42] <Jon47> venus_: the purpose of making a fiddle is that you distill the code down to its core issue so we don't have to sort through all the other complexiities of your project to help you
[08:02:59] <Jon47> doing so also has the side effect of often helping you to solve the problem yourself
[08:03:25] <pachet> venus_: http://jsfiddle.net/jYMYw/
[08:03:52] <Jon47> silverlining: when you say "value" do you mean the text nodes within the table cells?  tables don't have "values" inherently, as a property, like an input would..
[08:04:15] <silverlining> ya
[08:04:22] <silverlining> i mean the text nodes
[08:04:28] <silverlining> i ahve 2 columns
[08:04:35] <silverlining> and a bunch of rows
[08:05:08] <wild_oscar> is there any performance difference between having multiple <script> with document.ready() and a single one with multiple instructions?
[08:05:29] <venus_> wow pachet you rock man
[08:05:44] <silverlining> of course wild oscar
[08:06:01] <silverlining> jon47 do u know how to get the textnodes?
[08:06:17] <Jon47> silverlining: it depends on how you'd like to format your data but I imagine you'd do something like.. select the cells you're interested in, do a .each, and plop the innerHTML of each cell into a javascript hash and then send that off in your ajax
[08:06:25] <Jon47> .html() or innerHTML property
[08:06:33] <Jon47> or, .text() even
[08:06:59] <wild_oscar> silverlining: I ask this because as features are sometimes developed independently, keeping them in separate <script> tags is easier for code separation
[08:07:34] <silverlining> wild oscar i guess its up to u
[08:07:42] <silverlining> there are tradeoffs
[08:07:47] <pachet> wild_oscar: from the perspective of the interpreter, there's not much performance difference
[08:08:04] <pachet> multiple http requests obviously have their downsides
[08:08:45] <pachet> but then again, if you split your code up in a cogent way you can take advantage of caching on the scripts that havent been updated
[08:09:35] <wild_oscar> pachet: you mean refactoring functions to separate js files and include them in the doc.ready?
[08:10:21] <pachet> i just mean having separate script tags for different components versus serving them all in a single request
[08:10:37] <pachet> what you do with them ( bind them to document ready, or just call them, or dont do anything with them at all ) is up to you
[08:11:46] <wild_oscar> pachet: oh, yes...js scripts are only loaded on pages that need them (vs loading all javascript in, say, the "parent template", if that's what you mean)
[08:13:05] <koden> hey all I am trying to use jquery to test an href basically I am givin a link like http://www.example.com/category/single-post    what I need to look for is just http://www.example.com/category/ and not capture the single_post piece, how do I do this?
[08:15:32] <pachet> ?eval 'http://www.example.com/category/single-post'.split('http://www.example.com/category/').length > 1 @ koden
[08:15:34] <bot-t> koden: true
[08:16:14] <pachet> more a javascript question, than jQuery
[08:17:01] <koden> sorry
[08:18:08] <New0> after if ( $.browser.msid ) how to? $("head").prepend(document.createTextNode('http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8"'));
[08:18:41] <Brodingo> ew
[08:19:19] <silverlining> hi
[08:19:24] <silverlining> i did something like
[08:19:40] <silverlining> $('.mytable'),serialize()
[08:19:48] <silverlining> to try to get the values in my table
[08:19:54] <silverlining> how do i pick it up on the other end?
[08:20:45] <Jon47> define "on the other end"
[08:20:48] <ajpiano> silverlining: you can only call serilaize on a form, or form elements
[08:20:59] <rroelofs> silverlining: do you mean ver data = $('.mytable'),serialize()
[08:21:05] <rroelofs> var
[08:21:13] <silverlining> i think so
[08:21:15] <silverlining> idk
[08:21:18] <silverlining> can i do that?
[08:21:35] <silverlining> the other end is a c# mvc app
[08:21:41] <silverlining> web server rather
[08:22:31] <rroelofs> silverlining: serialize gives you a javascript object that you can can use in a $.post call
[08:22:35] <silverlining> if i can only call serialize on the form elements
[08:22:49] <ajpiano> silverlining: or the form itself
[08:22:59] <silverlining> man how am i suppose to get the values in my grid
[08:23:03] <ajpiano> lol
[08:23:06] <silverlining> which is actually a table
[08:23:12] <ajpiano> silverlining: $("#yourtable").find(":input").serialize()
[08:23:19] <ajpiano> silverlining: you have a form element right
[08:23:29] <silverlining> well thing is this
[08:23:45] <silverlining> this grid is opened inside a dialog popup
[08:23:53] <silverlining> and the page that calls it already has a form
[08:24:03] <silverlining> and isnt there something like i cant have 2 nested forms
[08:24:07] <ajpiano> pages can have more than one form as long as they are not nested
[08:24:09] <silverlining> so i didnt put a form inside my table
[08:24:16] <silverlining> well it will be nested
[08:24:19] <ajpiano> there's nothing about that design that necessitates the latter form being nested inside the former
[08:24:20] <silverlining> i think
[08:24:20] <ajpiano> why
[08:24:25] <silverlining> since its in a dialog box?
[08:24:27] <silverlining> or not?
[08:24:37] <ajpiano> dialog boxes are typically kept at the bottom of the DOM in the document flow
[08:24:43] <silverlining> ya
[08:24:46] <ajpiano> they are not nested inside of the elements that trigger them, typically
[08:24:53] <silverlining> ok
[08:25:48] <silverlining> well actually shit
[08:25:52] <silverlining> inside my dialog
[08:25:54] <silverlining> there are tabs
[08:26:06] <silverlining> and there is a save button within the dialog
[08:26:14] <silverlining> so there is a form around the tabs
[08:26:20] <silverlining> but within one of my tabs is this grid
[08:26:35] <silverlining> so i cant put a form in this grid or itll be nested within the dialog form
[08:26:41] <silverlining> that sux man
[08:26:51] <rethus> i have a div with 2 <Select> fields, and one imputfield... below much more divs of that kind... now i want to check, if both selectbox in a div has a value... check is ok, else check is false and error will appear....
[08:27:02] <rethus> i use this to get the select-values $('#form_addFilter select option:selected').each
[08:27:13] <silverlining> ajpiano if i dont have a form within my table how do i get the values?
[08:27:23] <ajpiano> silverlining: form elements have to be nested in forms,
[08:27:30] <ajpiano> nothing will break if you don't have it but it's just not right to not do it
[08:27:31] <rethus> but if i choose select 1 a value and leave select2 empty... its not false...
[08:27:34] <rethus> why
[08:27:36] <ajpiano> silverlining: and furthermore i showed you earlier
[08:28:01] <ajpiano> $(#"yourtable").find(":input").serialize()
[08:28:05] <silverlining> im not sayin the form elements i saying there will be 2 nested forms
[08:28:13] <ajpiano> why would there be two nested forms
[08:28:34] <silverlining> cause within my dialog there is a save button below some tabs that are in the dialog
[08:28:50] <ajpiano> the entire dialog box can be a different form
[08:28:51] <silverlining> but the table i am trying to use now is within one of the tabs
[08:28:58] <rethus> seems this: $('#form_addFilter select option:selected') gets only the first selectbox
[08:29:00] <ajpiano> or the individual tabs can be forms
[08:29:15] <silverlining> oh ok
[08:29:29] <ajpiano> silverlining: are you using the jquery ui tabs?
[08:29:39] <silverlining> yes
[08:29:41] <silverlining> the thing is
[08:29:48] <silverlining> there is a save button outside the tabs
[08:29:51] <rethus> so have i to to a each on '#fforrm_addFilter select' and inside of this each again each on 'options:select' ?
[08:30:01] <silverlining> that saves whatever they made changes to the tab
[08:30:18] <ajpiano> silverlining: they are flexible with the markup you use... you can use <form> instead of <div> for the tabs
[08:30:36] <ajpiano> silverlining: you can instead just wire that button to fire the submit of the form in the active tab
[08:30:59] <pachet> 'the thing is, my form can only be submitted when a hobbit presses the submit button with a magic dagger, and they're from the land before time, so..'
[08:31:05] <silverlining> oh ok
[08:31:08] <ajpiano> pachet: haha
[08:32:06] <silverlining> i feel like is built like a disney movie sometimes
[08:33:58] <pachet> more like that part in disaster movies, just when you think that things couldn't get worse, you find out the dinosaurs can unlock doors
[08:34:07] <pachet> i wonder if any languages have a word for that
[08:39:21] <New0> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'sendToActionScript' of undefined    in IE, google chrome. but not Firefox which is working! what is the prob?
[08:41:15] <silverlining> how do i fire the form in the active tab?
[08:41:52] <pachet> get one of the middle management to do it for you
[08:42:13] <silverlining> they dont know how
[08:45:05] <rubatdub> i have a little issue with jquery can someone help me ?
[08:45:17] <silverlining> how do u wire up a button to submit a form
[08:45:29] <New0> RuAnt|, you can ask. but not to ask if u can ask
[08:45:50] <rubatdub> New0, ok
[08:46:11] <New0> silverlining, how do you make something happen? or
[08:47:21] <rubatdub> i have the following javascript : http://pastebin.com/H7N4dst1
[08:47:29] <rubatdub> it is a vote system
[08:47:42] <ajpiano> silverlining: i will make a demo for you
[08:47:46] <ajpiano> cause i got you onto this path :p
[08:48:30] <New0> silverlining, what's not working there?
[08:49:44] <silverlining> oh ok
[08:49:52] <silverlining> thanks ajpiano
[08:52:09] <rubatdub> i have the following javascript : http://pastebin.com/H7N4dst1
[08:52:21] <rubatdub> and my html is : http://pastebin.com/i58ACdwj
[08:52:22] <wild_oscar> on a more general question: do you know how to fix the fact that Eclipse complains with the minified .js jquery file?
[08:52:36] <wild_oscar> apparently, this: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=349020#c15
[08:56:09] <venus_> i have two divs <div id="one"><div id="two"> how can i move two before one
[08:57:01] <ajpiano> $("#two").insertBefore("#one")
[08:57:26] <silverlining> whats that?
[08:57:57] <silverlining> was taht for my demo?
[08:58:59] <ajpiano> silverlining: what do you think.
[08:59:05] <ajpiano> read the question immediately before it and decide
[08:59:37] <silverlining> how do i do a select for td with class value
[09:00:23] <ajpiano> $("td.foo")
[09:00:33] <silverlining> tahnsk
[09:01:02] <ajpiano> silverlining: http://jsbin.com/isoli3/33/edit#preview
[09:01:21] <Jon47> venus_: did the channel not answer that exact same question with precisely the same answer 30 minutes ago?
[09:01:24] <silverlining> how do i do a selector for or   i mean td.value or td.key
[09:01:25] <venus_> ajpiano : http://jsfiddle.net/qgXk8/1/ not working
[09:01:26] <venus_> ?
[09:02:11] <Jon47> venus_: you didn't close the first div
[09:02:14] <ajpiano> venus_: div two already is already before div one
[09:02:22] <Jon47> http://jsfiddle.net/qgXk8/2/
[09:02:27] <ajpiano> it's throwing a DOM exception
[09:02:27] <silverlining> thanks ajpiano
[09:02:56] <ajpiano> silverlining: $("td.key, td.value") or $("td").filter(".key, .value")
[09:03:05] <ajpiano> silverlining: you use a comma to denote multiple selectors
[09:03:56] <silverlining> ajpiano in ur example if i had a table in one of the tabs how would i get the values?
[09:04:11] <ajpiano> silverlining: it would work exactly the same
[09:04:13] <ajpiano> you want to serialize the form
[09:04:26] <ajpiano> the fact that the elements would be nested inside a table inside the form does not matter
[09:04:43] <silverlining> oh ok
[09:04:45] <silverlining> cool
[09:11:07] <venus_> wierd i tried the same thing on my site but it doesnt work
[09:12:50] <johnline3> hey guys, i have a main.js and have a chunk of code that i only want executed if the <body> has a certain id tagged to it
[09:13:03] <johnline3> im not sure which is the best way
[09:28:00] <rroelofs> johnline3:  if it is in a separate file you could use $.script to load it when needed
[09:28:09] <rubatdub> i have the following code to vote & unvote for photos : http://jsbin.com/etaqac/7/
[09:28:38] <rubatdub> when i have vote or unvote i can't unvote or vote back
[09:29:47] <justspamjustin> Does anyone know of a javascript grid view that allows for inline editing with copy and paste kind of like google docs?
[09:34:03] <jorts> rubatdub you probably need to add the vote or unvote class when you click
[09:34:18] <jorts> nm
[09:35:55] <rubatdub> jorts, i have to add class="vote" or class="unvote" ok i try it
[09:36:06] <jorts> yea i saw that after i wrote my comment
[09:37:50] <rubatdub> jorts, i have tried that but once i have voted or unvoted i can't vote again ...
[09:38:02] <rubatdub> jorts, strange behaviour ...
[09:41:56] <jorts> just use .live("click", (function() { instead of .click()
[09:42:57] <jorts> i saved the jsbin
[09:43:09] <rubatdub> jorts, ok
[09:43:11] <rubatdub> i try it
[09:45:54] <ThiefMaster> unless you are stuck with an ancient version, better use $(document).on('click', function(){...})
[09:46:06] <ThiefMaster> or even better, use an element closer to the dynamically added elements
[09:46:20] <jorts> oh, yea, live was deprecated
[09:46:29] <ThiefMaster> err, .on('click', 'selector', function(){})
[09:49:30] <rubatdub> jorts, still not working with .on('click',
[09:49:32] <jpic> hi all, i made an autocomplete script that works great, except for the positioning of the suggestions box. How should a suggestion box be positioned under an input ?
[09:49:42] <rubatdub> jorts, http://jsbin.com/etaqac/13/
[09:58:42] <Rich> Hi All, I'd like to return a string from a php function (like responseText in usual AJAX), but from this code:
[09:58:44] <Rich> http://pastebin.com/TwpcFeb0
[09:58:56] <Rich> Any Ideas appreciated :)
[09:59:58] <LukeNukem> Rich, damn wish i was you
[09:59:59] <LukeNukem> :3
[10:07:10] <johnline3> thanks rroelofs
[10:07:15] <johnline3> might have to use hasclass
[10:07:55] <johntron> i'm trying to create an editable element that replaces instances of "[[person]]" with a stylized <div>. I'm able to do this with a contenteditable div, but when I do the text replacement, the caret position gets reset to the beginning of the div. is there a better way of doing this? I definitely don't need a full-blown RTE.
[10:12:26] <johntron> really, just a reliable way of getting and setting the caret position is all I need
[10:14:01] <raj> why in the world is $.map backwards with its arguments?
[10:14:06] <raj> (el, i)
[10:14:16] <raj> makes no sense to just switch this one method
[10:14:20] <xxiao> http://pastebin.com/TkaZEgQN
[10:14:42] <xxiao> can someone has a quick look at this short snippet, i could not grab the value from jquery ajax
[10:14:54] <xxiao> s/has/have, thanks
[10:15:26] <ngharo> xxiao: try $(msgx).find('#id') etc
[10:15:27] <silverwind> Probably because the guy who wrote jQuery smoked magic cigarettes the day he implemented it.
[10:15:31] <raj> xxiao, you're saying msgx is undefined?
[10:16:15] <xxiao> raj: i got 3 values NaN
[10:16:28] <xxiao> the response from ajax call is sane
[10:16:32] <raj> Cork, when you get a chance, can you fix $.map so its arguments are (i,el) ?
[10:16:36] <raj> thanks =)
[10:16:37] <xxiao> somehow the callback can not parse it
[10:16:57] <xxiao> ngharo: i tried that, either $(msgx), or html(msgx), no help
[10:17:02] <raj> xxiao, what's console.log(msgx) ?
[10:17:25] <silverwind> raj, What? I thought you were complaining of the opposite..
[10:17:44] <raj> silverwind, I am
[10:17:44] <silverwind> It doesn't make any sense that the index be the first argument in a "map" function.
[10:17:51] <raj> silverwind, why?
[10:18:04] <raj> when every other function, such as .each and whatnot, all have (i,el)
[10:18:07] <ajpiano> raj:  map isn't the one that's backwards, each is
[10:18:09] <silverwind> raj, because when you want to "map" over something, you don't care about the index.
[10:18:26] <ajpiano> and what actually happened is that jquery each was written before there was a standard array.prototpye.forEach
[10:18:29] <silverwind> So.. in any other lib than jquery, the first parameter is always the element
[10:18:32] <xxiao> raj, console.log(msgx) is at http://pastebin.com/Nx5XHUK2
[10:18:50] <ajpiano> so what most people complain about is each being backwards.  $.map conforms with Array.prototype.map
[10:18:59] <silverwind> Which is good.
[10:19:00] <raj> interesting
[10:19:05] <raj> i really don't care either way
[10:19:09] <silverwind> $(selector).map doesn't though..
[10:19:13] <raj> but it should be the same, GD it
[10:19:16] <silverwind> So it can be confusing..
[10:19:38] <ajpiano> silverwind: yeah, no doubt about it that's confusing till you get used to it
[10:19:53] <ajpiano> but it's pretty much unchangeable without a massive back-compat break
[10:20:01] <silverwind> ajpiano, I understand that :)
[10:20:04] <raj> silverwind, $(selector).map doesn't what?
[10:20:33] <raj> ajpiano, why didn't they just make everything backwards if .each was backwards
[10:20:39] <raj> that would be the smart thing to do
[10:20:48] <raj> just to have some consistency
[10:21:08] <raj> xxiao, that whole thing is your console.log(xmsg)?
[10:21:49] <silverwind> raj, in that version of "map", the element is represented by "this" and the first argument of the callback is the index
[10:21:54] <DeltaHeavy> xiao_unlimited of different xiao?
[10:21:57] <Penorsaurus> Hi there
[10:22:01] <Penorsaurus>  Anyone know what I am doing wrong here: http://pastebin.com/HP3ZyJhT
[10:22:20] <Penorsaurus> the two just blend together
[10:22:24] <silverwind> raj, So $().map and $.map have two different behaviors..
[10:22:25] <raj> silverwind, great, another difference
[10:23:16] <silverwind> raj, Eventually... there will be no reason to use $.each $.map because the ECMAScript versions will be available on every browser..
[10:23:40] <raj> silverwind, in which case forEach will be used?
[10:23:45] <silverwind> Right
[10:23:54] <raj> that's like 10 years from now
[10:23:58] <Penorsaurus> no one know :(
[10:24:17] <silverwind> raj, probably a bit less than that... but yeah, it will take a lot of time :(
[10:24:32] <raj> :(
[10:24:35] <silverwind> But hey, nobody forbids you to use polyfills
[10:25:30] <xxiao> raj: the html is from console.log(msgx),
[10:25:34] <silverwind> raj, for example: https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/
[10:25:57] <raj> xxiao, you're returning html in your server response?
[10:26:10] <xxiao> raj: yes for a simple test case
[10:26:32] <xxiao> raj: i remove html, body, content-type etc, no help
[10:27:05] <raj> so msgx contains what you want, no?
[10:27:07] <raj> looks fine to me
[10:30:37] <xxiao> raj: msgx is what i want
[10:30:48] <xxiao> however, $(msgx).find('id') returns []
[10:31:16] <ajpiano> xxiao: find("#id") ??
[10:31:19] <xxiao> raj: $(document.createElement('div')).html(msgx).find('#id'); returns <p id='id>98</p>
[10:31:31] <xxiao> ajpiano: sorry, typo
[10:31:35] <ajpiano> ok
[10:31:47] <raj> did you delete your paste?
[10:31:49] <raj> can't find it
[10:31:53] <ajpiano> xxiao: sometimes if you give a long html string with top level elements that you want to get only one of
[10:31:57] <ajpiano> you have to use .filter() instead of .find()
[10:32:10] <xxiao> raj: it might be timeout
[10:32:12] <raj> really?
[10:32:19] <xxiao> i set it 10 mins
[10:32:21] <raj> never heard of that ajpiano
[10:32:31] <raj> ok, well, it's gone
[10:32:39] <xxiao> let me do it again
[10:34:18] <xxiao> raj: http://pastebin.com/n6HVUMmg
[10:34:26] <xxiao> the msgx returning html looks good to me
[10:34:59] <xxiao> the find of the id either returns []($(msgx).find('#idx'))
[10:35:20] <xxiao> or it returns the whole <p> line instead of the value: $(document.createElement('div')).html(msgx).find('#id');
[10:35:21] <raj> so you need $('p').each(function(i,el){$(el).html()})
[10:36:54] <xxiao> for jquery do I still need iterate all the <p>?
[10:37:09] <xxiao> thought i only need it for js
[10:37:53] <ravenzz> what the second sentence means?
[10:52:11] <coachz> Any jqGrid users here ?
[10:55:07] <gho5t> i used it a while ago
[10:58:08] <ravenzz> are there some design patterns for plugin development?
[10:58:41] <ravenzz> or some good reference to start its development?
[10:59:08] <ravenzz> to learn how to code a good plugin I meant
[10:59:19] <coachz> Do i need to include something other than jquery-ui to get datepicker to work on line 105 ?   http://pastebin.com/UpuJW8Ne
[11:04:48] <coachz> where do i get  ui.datepicker.js please
[11:07:04] <jorts> http://jqueryui.com/download
[11:07:13] <coachz> thanks, just found it
[11:12:12] <coachz> Is jquery.ui.core.js supposed to be in that download ?
[11:12:46] <coachz> found it
[11:13:12] <coachz> i think i ate too much, lack of oxygen
[11:14:31] <rubatdub> jorts, just came back .... didn't figure out to make my vote function work :(
[11:14:58] <rubatdub> i have read the documentation about click events but didn't find anything in it ...
[11:17:48] <silverlining> how come it says form.filter is not a fucntion
[11:20:07] <silverlining> ajpiano
[11:20:33] <silverlining> im trying to use ur example but when i put the code in my dialog
[11:20:37] <MrAgarwal> Hello I have a question about jquery auto-complete. I have implemented a geocoder autocomplete, and one that is based off names I have in a database. is there a way i can create a input that gets autocomplete data from both the geocoder and my own database?
[11:20:42] <silverlining> it says forms.filter is not a function
[11:30:02] <heitor> hi, how does trigger() works with promise().done() ?
[11:31:45] <coachz> who are the jqgrid experts here ?
[11:32:34] <heitor> i'm trying to trigger a submit event in a form that is in another file, and would like to do other things after everything inside this event resolves. I tried this http://api.jquery.com/promise/ (first example) but I dont have the event in the same file, I only have the trigger method. Does someone know what I have to do?
[11:34:11] <gho5t> heitor: what would it being in the same file matter
[11:34:24] <gho5t> js doesn't consider a file a different scope
[11:37:37] <heitor> im trying to make a tab system, so theres a main html with the tabs. each tab has a trigger for other html files to be written by ajax calls in divs on the main html. one js file is called when the page loads and the other is called when the tab loads.
[11:37:56] <MrHacks> Does anyone know why the XML I insert into my file using JQuery is processed into an HTML file as XML when I requested it to swap out the XML elments for HTML elements? http://pastebin.com/hkFaebFe
[11:38:45] <MrHacks> Should I use an XSL file to fix this issue?
[11:41:39] <heitor> the thing is that in main.js i can't query for $("#formId") cause the formId form doesn't exist yet
[11:44:05] <gho5t> sounds like you're going to have to hook into the addTab method (assuming you're using jquery ui tabs widget)
[11:45:12] <gho5t> "load" rather
[11:46:14] <heitor> I coded the tab system myself. I'm not using jquery ui... should I?
[11:47:25] <MrAgarwal> Hello I have a question about jquery auto-complete. I have implemented a geocoder autocomplete, and one that is based off names I have in a database. is there a way i can create a input that gets autocomplete data from both the geocoder and my own database?
[11:48:05] <gho5t> well probably but you could just create a callback
[11:48:18] <gho5t> fire a function after you load your tab
[11:48:43] <gho5t> if you're using jquery's ajax methods you already have one after the asynch method completes
[11:48:59] <heitor> gho5t: actually i have to submit a form before i load the next tab
[11:49:36] <heitor> gho5t: but since they are async, the tab is loading before I get the results I need from the form
[11:50:36] <gho5t> why can't you submit the form and once its finished, trigger the loading of the next tab
[11:53:05] <heitor> gho5t: Uncaught ReferenceError: tabSelected is not defined -- tabSelected is a variable inside the method that triggers the form submit. it is not avaliable out of this scope
[11:53:30] <heitor> gho5t: I don't know if I made myself clear, I can show the code if you want
[11:57:23] <aghouseh> is there a way to delegate() multiple events to the same handler?
[12:03:16] <heitor> Ok, it works. I just put all the functions out of the $(document).ready() scope. they are all global now. Kinda ugly, but was the way I made it work =(
[12:04:54] <lindsayo> I have a dynamic list of titles, when each of them is clicked, I want a popup of its related text. I figured out to use toggle, but it toggles on all of the popups at once.
[12:05:08] <lindsayo> I only want the specific popup to come up, not all of them.
[12:05:10] <jorts> change your selector
[12:05:27] <lindsayo> jorts, you mean I should use the jquery to change the selector on the clicked on div?
[12:05:35] <lindsayo> and it won't add it to all of them?
[12:05:54] <jorts> you need a selector that's unique to the item that you want to have the popup over
[12:06:26] <lindsayo> yes, but since this is a dynamic list, it doesn't make sense to hard-code the specific selectors into the jquery.
[12:06:36] <lindsayo> if I add a new piece of content later, I'd have to add that to the jquery
[12:07:01] <jorts> you could add id="title" or something into the element
[12:07:56] <lindsayo> ah, but this is the jquery knowledge I guess I'm missing: how do I make the jquery know which title it is?
[12:08:36] <lindsayo> I can make the HTML dynamically assign the title or a class based on the content, but then how do I make that also dynamic in jQuery?
[12:09:22] <jorts> can you paste your code up somewhere?
[12:09:27] <lindsayo> sure
[12:10:24] <lindsayo> jorts: http://pastebin.com/7ZsaESVM
[12:10:45] <lindsayo> You can see where I stuck a $count in the PHP to increment the classes on the popups.
[12:11:06] <lindsayo> of course at this point that breaks the jquery completely, but it's where I came in to ask how to make the jquery do dynamic stuff, too.
[12:11:25] <lindsayo> *how to make it understand that the classes are dynamically assigned
[12:14:06] <silverlining> how come when i do
[12:14:07] <silverlining> $('.tabs').tabs().find('form').filter(':visible').submit();
[12:14:15] <silverlining> it appends to the url string
[12:14:21] <silverlining> instead of sending a regular post
[12:15:41] <jorts> lindsayo, i would change it to $(this).children('.service-popup').toggle();
[12:15:59] <jorts> and remove the count
[12:16:38] <lindsayo> jorts: testing
[12:17:55] <lindsayo> jorts: no dice
[12:18:00] <lindsayo> reading about .children
[12:19:54] <jorts> use .find() instead of .children()... it'll traverse down the DOM.  I didn't see that it was two levels down.
[12:20:36] <lindsayo> that's perfect
[12:20:37] <lindsayo>  you rock
[12:20:39] <lindsayo> thank you!
[12:20:41] <lindsayo> jorts++
[12:20:42] <jorts> word
[12:21:02] * lindsayo reads about .find()
[12:21:19] <lindsayo> oh that's handy
[12:39:43] <badbandit> hello, does anyone know if there is any way to access data returned in an ajax callback from outside the ajax call?
[12:40:24] <ravenzz> store them in a var?
[12:40:35] <badbandit> aka determine when it is finished with something like .complete(function(){ return someData; }, and then access that outside???
[12:40:42] <badbandit> does not work
[12:40:47] <badbandit> keep getting undefined
[12:41:07] <ravenzz> undefined what?
[12:42:24] <badbandit> I have some json that I store in an array inside the .getJSON callback called galleryData, if I put the whole .getJSON into a function and do return galleryData, I cannot get that outside the function
[12:42:51] <ravenzz> ofc
[12:43:16] <badbandit> ?
[12:45:14] <jorts> create a variable outside of the .getJSON scope then access it upon the successful completion of the ajax query?
[12:45:37] <badbandit> I tried that
[12:46:19] <badbandit> right athttp://www.hastebin.com/layavifomi.coffee
[12:51:57] <xec_> ?ajax101 @ badbandit
[12:51:58] <bot-t> badbandit, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[12:55:04] <badbandit> ok, I realize it's a scoping issue
[12:55:04] <badbandit> http://forums.penny-arcade.com/discussion/125534/solved-retrieving-data-from-a-jquery-ajax-event
[12:55:27] <badbandit> that is the same issue... so I can either change to synchronous or store the data in some element
[12:55:29] <badbandit> and retrieve it
[12:55:37] <xec_> badbandit: it's not as much a scope issue as it is a timing issue
[12:55:37] <shoky> halu
[12:55:50] <shoky> how i fix eror
[12:55:55] <badbandit> er yeah, that's why I thought the .complete method on the ajax call would work
[12:55:57] <badbandit> but apparently not
[12:56:13] <xec_> shoky: try ctrl+alt+shift+f for autofic
[12:56:13] <ravenzz> actually if you do a synchronous request there won't be timing issues
[12:56:16] <xec_> autofix*
[12:56:30] <shoky> u no liar?
[12:56:32] <ravenzz> but it could sucks
[12:56:36] <shoky> u say honest to me?
[12:56:38] <jorts> lol
[12:57:21] <xec_> synchronous jax is bad, because you'll block the entire site for unkown amount of time
[12:57:41] <ravenzz> as I said .. in a shorter way "sucks"
[12:57:56] * teamrubberandy can't figure how to pass css to ninjaui widgets  
[12:57:57] <teamrubberandy> http://ninjaui.com/#dialog
[12:58:17] <ravenzz> badbandit call your gallery builder function from the ajax callback
[12:59:04] <badbandit> ravenzz: problem is that I need to call that .getJSON multiple times, it's left out in that hastebin but there are up to N number of page's of results from the api
[12:59:32] <xec_> badbandit: like ravenzz says, do your stuff (that relies on data from the getJSON) after it's done. it will not be done on the lines after the call
[12:59:40] <badbandit> so I need a way to start the galleria, then run a function that gets each new page of images from the api and adds them to the gallery until it hits a 404
[13:00:08] <ravenzz> do try to find a smart way to do that
[13:00:16] <badbandit> I want to
[13:00:16] <xec_> hehe
[13:00:25] * xec_ hugs ravenzz
[13:00:32] <ravenzz> so*
[13:00:32] <badbandit> my friend suggests stuffing the data into a hidden element
[13:00:43] <badbandit> inside the callback
[13:00:57] <xec_> badbandit: hidden element or a variable makes no difference
[13:01:04] <ravenzz> Do you want to load all the galleries and the show them all?
[13:01:14] <badbandit> our api limits results to 20 at a time
[13:01:32] <badbandit> so I need to hit it again and again until it gets no more data back
[13:01:37] <badbandit> then load the gallery
[13:01:50] <ravenzz> I would load the first 20 and then load on scroll
[13:01:58] <ravenzz> or something like that
[13:02:04] <badbandit> most galleries dont have more than 20 images but for instance yesterday when jr seau died (i work at neewspaper) they wanted to make huge gallery
[13:02:13] <badbandit> and it coincided with me launching this new gallery yesterday
[13:02:20] <badbandit> I thought about that too...
[13:02:50] <ravenzz> I mean, probably the user won't ever see the 7th "set"
[13:03:00] <ravenzz> so why would you load them all at the begin?
[13:03:20] <badbandit> this would be easier if our api returned a total # of data sets
[13:03:35] <badbandit> I want it so when it loads, the user sees the total number of images in the gallery
[13:03:39] <badbandit> not have it update as they scroll
[13:03:42] <ravenzz> just to waste your server resources?
[13:03:50] <xec_> badbandit: i can't be sure about this until i understand your entire situation, but it sounds like you have two options: wait until all the http requests are done and then load the gallery, or wait until the first request is done and add images from subsequent requests later
[13:04:12] <badbandit> http://www.utsandiego.com/photos/galleries/2012/may/02/young-seau/#/0
[13:04:15] <ravenzz> doesn't your API provide a count variable?
[13:04:17] <gho5t> badbandit: ever hear of virtual scrolling
[13:04:23] <badbandit> doesnt provide count
[13:04:30] <badbandit> although im abotu to bug my backend deb
[13:04:31] <badbandit> dev
[13:05:18] <Whirl3d> did .or ever become part of jquery. I googled but didn't find the result I was hopng for
[13:05:19] <andrew9184> hey guys, i have 4 divs that all use the same function, but i want the function to be dynamic to the one that called it.  is there a way to pass in the caller ?
[13:05:44] <Whirl3d> andrew9184, $(this)?
[13:05:50] <xec_> badbandit: now, if your gallery plugin thing doesn't have a nice way of being able to add images later, i'm guessing you'll need to reinitiate the gallery each time, which makes for a horrible user experience
[13:06:06] <badbandit> it does have a nice way to load images...
[13:06:10] <badbandit> has nice api, thats why i chose it
[13:06:16] <ravenzz> anyway I would show the first 20 immediately. and then have a loading icon until all the sets are loaded...every time you get 20 images you increase the count
[13:06:27] <xec_> badbandit: as in you can load a set of images, and add more on the go?
[13:06:44] <andrew9184> hold on, ill try to jsfiddle an example
[13:06:47] <badbandit> yeah thats ideal, I just wanted the counter to show the actual total # of iamges
[13:06:53] <badbandit> otherwise it will always say "20"'
[13:06:56] <badbandit> then increase to 40
[13:07:35] <ravenzz> nobody is willing to wait until all the images has been loaded just to know the count
[13:07:36] <xec_> yeah, if you can't get a total count from the api, that sounds like the best approach to me
[13:07:37] <badbandit> regardless, I still have the issue of wanting to put the .get into a function that returns data to the outside, but apparently that is not possible
[13:07:48] <ravenzz> I'd prefer to have the first 20 immediately
[13:07:55] <badbandit> yeah
[13:08:03] <xec_> badbandit: it is possible, you're just doing the alert or whatever, too early
[13:08:07] <badbandit> I was thinking of making it load the next set when last image is seen
[13:08:17] <xec_> badbandit: you'll need to access it in the success callback
[13:08:18] <ravenzz> man it is a simple appendTo()
[13:08:38] <ravenzz> you don't need to collect them all
[13:08:53] <xec_> ravenzz: in theory, yes - but most plugins i've seen needs entire collection available at initialization
[13:08:56] <ravenzz> just append them every time you get a new set
[13:10:34] <ravenzz> buh
[13:19:10] <jstout24> i'm returning a json object and in that object is an entire "html" pageâ€¦ I want to select an id in it and replace content in the current DOM
[13:19:39] <jstout24> $(response.content, '#page-wrap').html() is null or $(response.content).find('#page-wrap')â€¦ but it's in there
[13:20:52] <johnkpaul> jstout24: I think you want $("#page-wrap").htm(response.content)
[13:21:12] <jstout24> response.content is an entire html page
[13:21:26] <jstout24> it includes doctype and all
[13:22:43] <johnkpaul> hm, jstout24, I don't know why you're sending an entire new page, butdid you try $("html").html(response.content)
[13:23:02] <xec_> jstout24: your second variation should work, assuming response.content is a html string
[13:23:20] <jstout24> xec_, yeah tthat's what I thought., hmm
[13:23:59] <EyePulp> so $('.foo > .bar') finds a bar element right inside foo.  How do I find .bar if it's nested deeper, but known to be inside .foo ?
[13:24:22] <gho5t> .find()
[13:24:41] <gho5t> actually no. $(".foo .bar")
[13:25:24] <Whirl3d> gho5t, why not .find()?
[13:25:43] <gho5t> well they both will work but .find() seems unnecessary
[13:26:29] <gho5t> that's like saying if you want to find ".foo .bar li" you would do $(".foo").find(".bar").find("li")
[13:26:33] <xec_> jstout24: just tested to make sure: http://jsfiddle.net/4Amhb/
[13:26:56] <jstout24> xec_, yeah i had it working.  it must be invalid markup on some elements
[13:27:22] <jstout24> arghâ€¦ yay for front-end guys.

[13:33:57] <ravenzz> ..
[13:33:58] <Whirl3d> clippy, I am constantly writing var opt=$("sel"); if (!opt.length) { opt=$("sel2")}  which would just rock if A) I could get an undefined from $() or B) if .or existed......A) var opt=$(sel)||$("sel2");   and B) var opt=$("sel").or("sel2");
[13:34:19] <ravenzz> foobar_ why don't you get the val() from the plugin?
[13:34:43] <Whirl3d> right now I have $$ defined to return undefined for 0 length $() and it works pretty well
[13:34:45] <ravenzz> $.fn.mytooltip = function(data) { var value = this.val() }
[13:35:16] <Giverny> .

[13:35:48] <ravenzz> well actually data is useless
[13:36:02] <xec_> Whirl3d: yeah, i don't know a smoother syntax. you could do it with a ternary but then you'd need to select twice which is even worse, really
[13:36:31] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: var sel = $(".foo"); sel = sel.length ? sel : $(".bar");
[13:37:01] <xec_> or two statements like that, but then an if is just as clean imo
[13:37:15] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, sure, that's what I used up until I defined $$ to return undefined for $() resultof 0 length
[13:37:21] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: yea that's a cute trick
[13:37:34] <ajpiano> it's the kind of thing that feels yucky to do if you're sharing code with lots of other devs
[13:37:39] <ravenzz> sel = !!sel.length || $(".bar")
[13:37:40] <ravenzz> ?
[13:37:42] <ajpiano> to define a slightly different permutation of jquery that acts a little different
[13:38:01] <ajpiano> ravenzz: sel wouldn't be a jQuery object anymore in the first case
[13:38:10] <ravenzz> k
[13:38:17] <xec_> ravenzz: then you might set sel to "true"
[13:38:21] <foobar_> http://jsfiddle.net/aTmkC/
[13:39:13] <ravenzz> anyway I would like to read some book about plugin development, design patterns for plugins and advanced coding
[13:39:20] <ravenzz> recommendations?
[13:39:29] <Whirl3d> I have modified a bunch of jquery pieces to work the way that makes sense for me. I totally understand the reasoning for jquery the way it is and rather than try to change it for everyone, I just change it for me. I love that about jquery
[13:40:22] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: just as long as when you work with other people, they know what you know about how you've changed it
[13:40:49] <Whirl3d> I never monkeypatch jquery, if that's what you mean.
[13:41:26] <simple__> someone?  I've got an accordion title that i've added a checkbox input too.  However I can't check the box because it just opens and closes the accordion, what do i do?
[13:41:50] <simple__> jquery UI accordion
[13:42:21] <xec_> ?demo @ simple__
[13:42:22] <bot-t> simple__, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:42:46] <ravenzz> eg I have done this working mess http://jsfiddle.net/xXHJs/ but I would like to learn how to rewrite it properly
[13:43:00] <Whirl3d> like $next=function() {var nxt=$(this).next(arguments); if (nxt.length) return nxt; return $(this).first(arguments);}
[13:43:10] <xec_> simple__: i don't see why a checkbox inside an accordion would act any differently than any other checkbox
[13:43:10] <simple__> demo: http://redwoodcountrywines.dividential.com/wines
[13:43:21] <simple__> could you look?
[13:43:29] <xec_> ah i see, you put it on the button
[13:43:45] <xec_> er, title, whatever
[13:43:58] <simple__> yup
[13:44:11] <simple__> is there a way around this without putting it into the content?
[13:44:22] <xec_> probably
[13:44:31] <xec_> gimme a min to test
[13:50:55] <batterhead> does .on() attach the handler to objects created after the dom has loaded?
[13:51:00] <batterhead> the way live does?
[13:51:41] <rroelofs> batterhead: .live never did that
[13:51:56] <Whirl3d> I didn't think so. I thought it attached it to existing element, but could listen for events to elements that were appeneded to the dom below the one with .on....but maybe I'm wrong.
[13:52:20] <rroelofs> .on can attach the handler to a parent just like .live attaches to body
[13:52:34] <rroelofs> but it's better to pick a  closer parent
[13:52:37] <xec_> simple__: you can prevent bubbling on the checkboxes relatively easily
[13:52:45] <xec_> simple__: like this http://jsfiddle.net/7Anhr/
[13:53:07] <batterhead> .on() is meant to replace .delegate()?
[13:53:30] <rroelofs> batterhead: and live and bind
[13:53:30] <xec_> batterhead: yes, and .bind() and .live()
[13:53:35] <batterhead> word
[13:53:41] * xec_ highfives rroelofs
[13:53:54] <simple__> sweetness thanks xec_ that would have taken me forever to find
[13:53:59] <rroelofs> xec_:  right back at ya
[13:54:54] <xec_> batterhead: no, word is still a separate product, although i hear google docs is gaining momentum
[14:01:35] <zim> Hi all. How can I bind $('.pick_date').datepicker(); to new content loaded by ajax?
[14:02:11] <xec_> zim: you can't, really
[14:02:26] <zim> :(
[14:03:15] <xec_> zim: you'd need to call .datepicker() on the new content, but that shouldnt be too much hassle as long as you have control over the ajax code
[14:03:36] <zim> will do ty
[14:07:58] <sivy> hi folks
[14:08:12] <sivy> anyone seen this issue with slideUp()? http://www.mail-archive.com/jquery-en@googlegroups.com/msg72807.html
[14:08:33] <sivy> that's from like 2009 and no one responded, but I've got the same issue
[14:09:23] <xec_> ?demo @ sivy
[14:09:23] <bot-t> sivy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:09:45] <sivy> xec_: one mo
[14:12:28] <sivy> xec: https://pushco.de/ && click the "start your free trial" button
[14:12:59] <zim> xec: what is the correct way to pull in new script via ajax?
[14:13:00] <sivy> the internal content shifts as the container goes through slideDown() and slideUp()
[14:13:26] <xec> zim: you shouldn't need to
[14:14:23] <zim> xec: re my last Q
[14:14:59] <xec> zim: you have some ajax code that is inserting new content, right? what does that code look like, could you pastebin?
[14:15:36] <zim> I have included html ..... <script>$('.pick_date').datepicker();</script>
[14:15:45] <xec> sivy: ah, i think i know what you mean, like the text inside also slides slightly
[14:16:00] <sivy> xec: yes; it appears to be anchored vertically centered
[14:16:04] <xec> zim: yeah you shouldn't need that
[14:16:25] <zim> what do I do then?
[14:16:48] <xec> zim: how do you insert this new content?
[14:17:23] <zim> OK slightly more complex than my example
[14:17:43] <sqwk> Is there a reason why the .width() function would return a different value depending on whether the page is being refreshed?
[14:17:49] <xec> sivy: you could just animate the height property manually, might be easiest, doesn't look like slideUp is very configurable
[14:18:39] <Whirl3d> anybody know of a function that splits a string into pieces based on multiple tokens? More than just .split(token), I am looking for .splitall(/,=:/g)   to split a string like "testing=someting+something" into [testing, something, somet] or perhaps [testing,=,something,.....
[14:19:34] <johnkpaul> ?eval "testing=someting+something".split(/[=|\+]/)
[14:19:37] <bot-t> johnkpaul: ["testing", "someting", "something"]
[14:19:41] <johnkpaul> @Whirl3d
[14:20:38] <xec> sivy: something like $("selector").animate({height: 0}) for the slideup
[14:20:50] <sivy> xec: yeah, looking at it now
[14:20:54] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul ,that cracks me up. Thanks.
[14:21:55] <xec> for the slidedown you might need to cache the normal height beforehand or something like that
[14:22:03] <johnkpaul> :) no problem, you can also use the \W or something for special characters
[14:22:56] <xec> johnkpaul, Whirl3d: i don't think you need the | in that regex?
[14:23:15] <johnkpaul> oh, yes, you're right, you don't
[14:23:29] <johnkpaul> that's just considered another character in the class, not or
[14:24:06] <Whirl3d> sure, thanks xec, johnkpaul, that was almost as foolish as wanting split to work exactly like it does, huh? LOL
[14:25:05] <youngin> Eviltwin: what the fuck man?
[14:25:13] <sivy> thanks xec - that's a bit better - still a little shift in the Welcome text on open
[14:25:19] <sivy> but niticably better
[14:27:15] <Whirl3d> I find that as I get further along this simple project, my hash-parsing function is starting to get more and more complex and I have a sneaking suspicion it will end up being Ben Allman's function and I will have spent a great deal of time just deriving it when I could just bite the bullet and use his.
[14:28:31] <xec> Whirl3d: tell me about it - i'm in the process of writing a rich text editor with intellisense-like autosuggest, about to tear my hair out lol
[14:29:50] <xec> Whirl3d: so many text editor plugins and so many autosuggest plugins, and i can't seem to be able to make any pair cooperate like i want ;)
[14:30:16] <Whirl3d> xec, did you check benAllman's site. LOL I can't help but feel like he's done it before me and written A LOT of really great info about it.
[14:30:30] <Whirl3d> it, being any and everything...
[14:30:37] <vacho> how do I check a checkbox with jquery UI?
[14:30:53] <vacho>  $('.show-name-check-box').attr('checked', 'checked'); does not with with jquery UI
[14:31:04] <xec> .prop("checked", true); iirc
[14:31:41] <Whirl3d> writing a text editor is not easy in any way...I admire your goal. And wtf, you still have hair?
[14:31:59] <xec> Whirl3d: haha, less and less every minute
[14:46:19] <diamonds> I am using jasmine for testing
[14:46:33] <diamonds> I have a pseudoselector that uses $(passedElem).offset();
[14:47:03] <diamonds> I want to mock it ("spy" on it) so offset necessarily returns e.g. {left:10,top:100}
[14:48:03] <diamonds> spyOn( $, 'offset' ).andReturn(102); //works not
[14:48:14] <diamonds> well it should be {left,right} but it doesn't work either way
[14:49:41] <xec> diamonds: top and left is correct, surely
[14:52:08] <diamonds> xec: spyon(obj,'function').andReturn(expression) will return any arbitrary value
[14:52:53] <diamonds> I can set it to an object with top and left if you think that will help, but I believe the issue is that I'm not setting the "spying" up properly
[14:53:09] <xec> i don't know either spyon or jasmine, i just think .offset() returns left and top properties only
[14:54:07] <xec> but if you can't get mock code to work it might not matter at all?
[14:59:15] <diamonds> spyOn( $.fn, 'offset' ).andReturn({top:0,left:0}); < this did it
[14:59:30] <diamonds> but it's very crude as I can't get different offsets for different methods
[14:59:33] <diamonds> sorry, selectors
[14:59:45] <tfittsy> anyone here use data-tables with a remote data server
[15:00:01] <xec> ?anyone @ tfittsy
[15:00:02] <bot-t> tfittsy, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[15:00:24] <tfittsy> I'm getting no errors but it isn't loading the data
[15:00:47] <xec> can you see what the http request returns?
[15:00:59] <tfittsy> yeah, it's valid json data
[15:01:30] <xec> and you get it working with local data?
[15:02:04] <tfittsy> yeah, I've had it working with local data.  One page load it even worked with remote data.  The previous ones it didn't, and since then it didn't either.
[15:03:40] <tfittsy> I ran through like 100 queries when it was working and they all loaded, so I'm sure that code is working fine
[15:04:01] <tfittsy> but I didn't change anything between the time it wasn't working, it worked once, and stopped working
[15:04:01] <xec> an arbitrary one, or the first page load
[15:04:56] <tfittsy> I'm not sure what you mean
[15:05:12] <tfittsy> and I do understand that it sounds a little odd for it to have not worked, worked, and not worked again without changing anything
[15:05:16] <xec> was it a random page load that worked, or was it the very first one
[15:05:20] <tfittsy> random
[15:05:22] <tfittsy> not the first
[15:05:46] <zim> xec: Sorry had to take a phone call. if I load <input name="foobar" class="pick_date"> when the page loads $('.pick_date').datepicker(); works but if its loaded by ajax no joy
[15:06:37] <xec> tfittsy: i'll admit, it sounds very strange yes - maybe some sort of timing issue. not convinced i'll be able to help i'm afraid
[15:07:47] <xec> zim: what do you mean by "loaded by ajax"? are you using $.get()? or $.ajax()? or $().load() perhaps?
[15:08:20] <zim> will jsfiddle.net  it
[15:08:54] <bluepnume> Hi -- how can I get the position of an element in a container, when some of the element is overflowed and hidden?
[15:09:36] <xec> bluepnume: the same way as if the element is not "overflowed and hidden"?
[15:09:44] <xec> i'm confused ;)
[15:09:59] <bluepnume> xec: sorry, I'll try to explain
[15:11:29] <bluepnume> xec: I have container X which contains elements A, B, and C -- X is a fixed height, with overflow:scroll. I want to find the position of element C within X
[15:12:03] <sqwk> Depending on whether i am refreshing the page or not I am getting different values for .width(). Has anyone seem this before?
[15:12:22] <bluepnume> xec: if the user scrolls down X, the positions of all of the elements returned with .position() changes
[15:13:43] <sqwk> bluepnume: why do they change? Are they static?
[15:13:49] <xec> sqwk: is this after the DOM is ready?
[15:14:14] <sqwk> xec: calling width inside $(document).ready(function() {}
[15:14:22] <bluepnume> sqwk: because they're changing position within X, since they're being scrolled through
[15:15:32] <zim> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/bCRXS/5/
[15:16:00] <xec> bluepnume: hmm... does .offset() also change? if not maybe you can use that and subtract the offset of the container
[15:16:27] <xec> bluepnume: also, maybe see ?scrollTop
[15:16:29] <bot-t> bluepnume, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[15:16:31] <sqwk> bluepnume: subtract scrollTop and scrollLeft
[15:16:42] <sqwk> http://www.snook.ca/archives/javascript/offsets_scrolling_overflow/
[15:16:51] <bluepnume> sqwk: scrolltop. that's what I need -- perfect, thanks
[15:17:09] <sqwk> xec was quicker ;)
[15:17:38] <silverlining> hi
[15:17:47] <bluepnume> Yep, thanks xec, much obliged!

[15:18:40] <silverlining> do u know
[15:18:54] <zim> xec: did did that explain my example?
[15:20:42] <xec> zim: this demonstrates your issue, right? the new content comes in after the datepicker call http://jsfiddle.net/bCRXS/7/
[15:21:30] <zim> yes

[15:26:30] <jerryleep> hello. with the widget factory, is it possible to get access to the jquery object a method was called on instead of the individual elements?
[15:26:40] <shennyg_> I know I can get an object of data attributes by calling .data() - how would I itterate through each of those?
[15:27:01] <shennyg_> I get a object has no method each when I try a .data().each()
[15:27:35] <xec> silverlining: it really depends on your server side framework
[15:28:28] <xec> silverlining: but make sure to inspect the http post request and see if the data looks right (compare with a normal form post for instance)
[15:29:42] <xec> ?$.each @ shennyg_
[15:29:45] <bot-t> shennyg_, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:30:09] <xec> doh
[15:30:15] <xec> ?jQuery.each() @ shennyg_
[15:30:16] <bot-t> shennyg_, jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[15:30:22] <xec> there we go
[15:30:50] <shennyg_> thanks xec I was doing obj.each not each(obj,

[15:32:09] <xec> ?botsmack
[15:32:10] <bot-t> xec, Couldn't find "botsmack" in jQuery Docs.
[15:32:16] <xec> worth a shot :P
[15:32:29] <jorts> heh

[15:42:59] <jerryleep> hello. with the widget factory, is it possible to get access to the jquery object a method was called on instead of the individual elements?
[15:48:31] <zim> xec: confused yet? lol
[15:53:48] <zim> xec: you still there?
[15:53:56] <dabear_> jerryleep: no, if you have multiple elements, one widget will be created for each of the elements
[15:54:15] <dabear_> jerryleep: so this.element will always be one element
[15:55:48] <jerryleep> dabear_: hmm, maybe i shouldn't use the widget factory if i need that kind of access?
[15:56:06] <dabear_> jerryleep: see ?xy
[15:56:07] <bot-t> jerryleep, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[15:57:34] <jerryleep> i need to iterate through the set of elements my plugin is called on and compile an array to be returned
[15:57:49] <jerryleep> i'm not even sure you can break out of chaining with the widget factory
[16:00:49] <PhonicUK> when i use .resizable() anyone know how to hide the tab in the corner?
[16:02:32] <dabear_> jerryleep: make that an input option to the widget instead

[16:29:04] <lduros> I want to switch between images, large images, and so far changing the src attribute
[16:29:06] <lduros> my question is
[16:29:11] <lduros> is it better to change the src attribute
[16:29:17] <lduros> or to create a new img tag
[16:29:20] <lduros> for each image
[16:29:40] <lduros> changing the src attribute sounds less intensive, but there might be other issues with different browsers
[16:37:55] <Whirl3d> I'm not the expert here, but you could cache the images by preloading them and then changing the src tag is easy and effective in all browsers as far as I know.
[16:45:35] <imachuchu> what would be the easiest way of selecting the last div inside of a parent div?
[16:46:34] <Whirl3d> $(this).siblings().last()  ?
[16:46:50] <MacroMan> Hi guys. Early preview of my new open source piece of work (written in jQuery of course): http://janimator.wakelin.co.cc/  Sorry if it seems like marketing, I'm not. I just want some early feedback on how it works etc. More info: https://github.com/MacroMan/jAnimator
[16:47:39] <kaipi> how could you preload the images?
[16:48:03] <imachuchu> Whirl3d: hmm, actually won't find what I exactly asked for (given the parent, find the last child), but I actually have one of the other children so I think it will work
[16:48:08] <imachuchu> thank you Whirl3d!
[16:49:34] <Whirl3d> kaipi, setup an image element, create a load handler that grabs the next url and applies it to the current image and then set the src attr to the first url in the list. as each one loads successfully, it grabs the next url and loads it. Make the image opacity:0 and your done
[16:51:22] <kaipi> Whirl3d, so the images will be in the browser cache, and when I need it, it will display instantly?
[16:51:28] <Whirl3d> MacroMan. I can't figure out what to do. I assume you set a div element and then set a keyframe to animate between them, but I don't see how to set a keyframe
[16:51:42] <Whirl3d> kapi, relatively instantly, yes
[16:51:58] <MacroMan> Whirl3d: Right click on the element and then add animation
[16:52:05] <MacroMan> Sorry, no docs yet
[16:52:59] <Whirl3d> no problem.
[16:53:23] <Whirl3d> The problem that I see with it is there is no clear identifier about where you are on the timeline
[16:53:38] <Whirl3d> and the timeline appears to work in reverse
[16:53:57] <MacroMan> Whirl3d: OK thanks for the feedback, I'll have a look at making it clearer.
[16:53:58] <Whirl3d> so, for example, I moved a div around then changed it's size and said preview all

[16:54:40] <Whirl3d> I expected the div to return to it's original position/size to start. But instead, it went from the enlarged sizeposition to the new position original size
[16:55:00] <shoky> ?csb3
[16:55:00] <bot-t> http://i.imgur.com/X7DSh.jpg
[16:55:18] <Whirl3d> Still. I love the concept and I have been working on the background for something like this for a while now.
[16:55:37] <MacroMan> As it works atm, when you move/resize the element when not recording the animation, it sets the starting size/position
[16:56:16] <MacroMan> It does need more features as it stands and is buggy. It's still in Alpha.
[16:57:04] <Whirl3d> Macroman, create a div, start recording, move it 300 to the right. change its size. Stop recording.
[16:57:16] <Whirl3d> the new sized image jumps to the original position
[16:57:40] <Whirl3d> then preview shrinks to the original size at the endpoint position
[16:58:12] <MacroMan> Yes, that's how it's supposed to work. Once you have finished recording, it shows it default position. Then when you preview, it does it''s thing
[16:58:27] <znf> Hello. Can someone help me a bit with a 3rd party library that uses jQuery and qTip2? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/120650/darktip/test.wow.html <-- I'm trying to apply DarkTip.handleHover() to all elements on load of the page, but it seems that "jQuery" is not defined, even though the library works and I see the browser loading the library. Can't wrap my head around this :-/
[16:58:32] <Whirl3d> but it should show it's original size and position
[16:58:41] <Whirl3d> not just it's original position
[16:58:45] <Whirl3d> altered size
[16:59:03] <MacroMan> Is it not resizing it again for you?
[16:59:10] <MacroMan> What browser are you using?
[16:59:15] <Whirl3d> nope. Chrome
[16:59:28] <Whirl3d> it goes from the endpoint size to the original size
[16:59:34] <Whirl3d> during the animation sequence
[16:59:44] <Whirl3d> but form the start point location to the endpoint location
[16:59:47] <MacroMan> Hmm. Strange. I'm using Chrome and it seems fine.
[17:00:21] <Whirl3d> Hey, you ought to have a hash-function so that I could provide the url and it would reset the animation
[17:00:32] <MacroMan> In the planning too
[17:00:40] <Whirl3d> cool.
[17:00:47] <MacroMan> I plan to have a save funciton with a short url to get the animation]
[17:01:00] <Whirl3d> Have you ever seen the Fuse animation engine for AS2?
[17:01:05] <MacroMan> No
[17:01:10] <MacroMan> What's AS2??
[17:01:19] <Whirl3d> Actionscript 2 (flash
[17:01:24] <MacroMan> Ah ok
[17:01:33] <Whirl3d> it's old, but it has some really cool features and uses
[17:01:33] <MacroMan> I'll look it up
[17:01:39] <MacroMan> Thanks
[17:01:42] <Whirl3d> np
[17:02:14] <MacroMan> And thanks for taking a look and jAnimator. Keep an eye on the GIT for updates
[17:02:46] <Whirl3d> znf, are you running your script in a $(document).ready() wrapper?
[17:03:02] <znf> Whirl3d, $ is not defined :-/
[17:03:38] <Whirl3d> $(document).ready(function () {do you magic}); will work if you have jquery loaded in the header of your page
[17:03:59] <znf> Whirl3d, yeah, but I don't
[17:04:45] <Whirl3d> then you should
[17:04:55] <MacroMan> znf: You don't have the jQuery library loaded? Then that's the problem
[17:05:05] <znf> MacroMan, the library is loading it
[17:05:19] <Whirl3d> but they are using jQuery
[17:05:34] <MacroMan> The library is loading the library!?!?!?
[17:05:34] <Whirl3d> try this: jQuery(your stuff) not $(yourstuff)
[17:05:56] <znf> MacroMan, I'm using a 3rd party library for some tooltips, that, by itself, is loading jQuery
[17:06:18] <MacroMan> Ah OK. got you
[17:06:20] <Whirl3d> They are also using jQuery() to call it
[17:06:27] <shoky> he has: window.DarkTip = {   'data': { 'settings': {'jquery'   : 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js',
[17:06:29] <znf> but, what you said rang a bell, so I moved the library in the head of the page
[17:06:32] <Whirl3d> probably in case it conflicts with other librarys
[17:06:56] <Whirl3d> *libraries
[17:07:30] <Whirl3d> rough
[17:08:01] <shoky> znf, you don't have jquery loaded but you're calling:   $j = jQuery.noConflict();
[17:08:04] <shoky> why?
[17:08:14] <znf> shoky, I was trying to see what's going on
[17:08:21] <shoky> k
[17:11:21] <yoasif> is there any easy way to validate only fieldsets that have been modified (input) in some way using the validation plugin?
[17:14:09] <znf> Please refresh page - what am I doing wrong? Why is jQuery(document).ready() getting called before jQuery is loading?
[17:14:40] <Whirl3d> yoasif, not that I know of, but you could setup a change handler that when any input (in a fieldset) changed, it could add a class to the fieldset. Then you could just validate the fieldsets with that class (being sure to remove it after validating)
[17:15:30] <yoasif> ah good idea Whirl3d
[17:21:29] <anastacio> if i'm building a library that makes use of jquery is there a good reason not to just add to the jquery namespace?
[17:22:38] <Whirl3d> anastacio, I'm thinking about starting a new job, do you thnk that's a good idea?
[17:23:02] <Whirl3d> The reason I ask is that your question is a little open-ended and hard to answer. Can you be more specific?
[17:24:16] <Whirl3d> if it has one method, than it might be a great idea to extend the jquery namespace. But adding lots of new methods to the jquery namespace may be harder to manage and may bog down browsers.
[17:27:32] <anastacio> the module i'm building uses jquery a lot, but doesn't operate on elements like a traditional plugin
[17:56:03] <sekyms> suggested can for underscore?
[17:56:52] <sekyms> CDN
[18:15:46] <kinesis> http://pastebin.com/d39SJzUL <- why isnt .draggable working when I add start: with a change css
[18:16:27] <austinallen> kinesis, maybe its the HTMl thats the problem
[18:16:32] <austinallen> HTML*
[18:17:15] <austinallen> Where is the External JQuery UI and JQuery Files Located in your HTML page
[18:20:10] <kinesis> it works without the start or stop
[18:20:13] <kinesis> so how could it be the html
[18:30:10] <rakm> hey guys, quick question, i'm using the keydown function, but looks like it executes before getting data from the event
[18:30:35] <rakm> i.e. if I press "e" in a textbox, the val() of the textbox is still blank after keydown
[18:30:53] <rakm> val() doesn't evaluate to "e" until the next keydown
[18:31:14] <rakm> is there a different function jQuery has to run after the key is pressed?
[18:32:12] <rakm> never mind.. it was simpler than I thought. using keyup()
[18:34:24] <chilversc> rakm: also, look at the changed event
[18:34:52] <rakm> will do, thanks
[18:35:12] <rakm> is that for things other than key presses also?
[18:35:44] <znf> So... is there a better (that doesn't seem right out retarded at this point) to do this? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/120650/darktip/test.wow.html
[19:01:26] <javalover> how can I check to see if a div exist inside my div?
[19:01:52] <javalover> so div id = "mydivset">  <div id = "myinnerdiv">   how can I check for my inner div?
[19:05:02] <Whirl3d> znf, what did you end up doing?
[19:05:20] <znf> Scraping the idea and implementing what I had in mind server-side.
[19:06:00] <Whirl3d> much better. Of course, now it doesn't really work  I get a big white screen after a long load time and a timer.
[19:07:02] <znf> Whirl3d, it works locally (if I open the file from the disk)
[19:07:12] <znf> But it just refuses to work like I want it to remote
[19:08:42] <Whirl3d> do you have to initialize the darktip settings before loading the plugin?
[19:09:01] <Whirl3d> and if this plugin is giving you such a hassle, there are LOADS of other plugins that prolly do the same thing
[19:09:26] <znf> Whirl3d, none other that work with that API I need
[19:10:25] <znf> So I'll just use the script in it's default form for most stuff, and then format the text based on data server-side, instead of relying on JS to do that
[19:10:42] <Whirl3d> look. There is a place in darktip where you can set the jquery parameter.
[19:11:09] <Whirl3d> load jquery and rather than having darktip load it as well, just put it in your ____darktypSettings ojbect
[19:11:25] <znf> yeah, I've seen that, too, but it's just not worth it
[19:12:30] <znf> I was trying to use that script to format entries in a table just so I don't duplicate API calls, but it's more trouble than it's worth it
[19:38:43] <narkeeso> Are there any known bugs with using el.eq(n).remove() in 1.7.2, for some reason remove() is targeting the wrong indexâ€¦ however, I can clearly see in a log that the element is the correct index, yet remove() is targeting index 0.
[19:43:04] <narkeeso> The funny thing is that .css() targets the element properly
[19:43:14] <narkeeso> .hide() and .remove() don't
[19:43:38] <narkeeso> i haven't tested other functions
[19:45:12] <sahyr> http://snipt.org/uighh2
[19:45:29] <sahyr> This is not working in the Android browser
[19:45:50] <sahyr> It's working on all desktop browsers, mobile safari, and mobile firefox
[19:46:01] <sahyr> The buttons don't show
[19:46:16] <sahyr> The "sidebar" div is absolutely positioned
[20:23:35] <baconmania> Hey guys, I have a recursive function that does a bunch of slideDown()s and I want to wait till the function is completely done animating before executing a second function, how would I do that?
[20:23:56] <baconmania> I know I can set a callback on animate(), but it's a recursive function so I'm not sure how that would work
[20:25:40] <shoky> uhm
[20:25:48] <shoky> you can split stuff up into seperate functions, you know
[20:26:47] <shoky> and have it still be recursive
[20:28:33] <baconmania> hmm
[20:28:43] <baconmania> so split stuff up and then use callbacks?
[20:28:46] <shoky> ya
[20:29:22] <shoky> if you want you can just set the callback to be the same function that set the callback ;p
[20:29:43] <baconmania> right
[21:29:03] <Whirl3d> anybody know of a quick way to traverse up the dom heirarchy to find a common parent between elements of the same class? In other words, if you have a div that has lots of divs with li items of a given class (say .toy) and you want to get their common ancestor...what's the best way to do that?
[21:32:11] <Whirl3d> wtf? Is Weird Science on Cinemax or something?
[21:33:19] <tw2113> worth it
[21:35:55] <Whirl3d> that or an all night marathon of zapped!
[21:42:34] <shoky> <div id=container> <div> <li.toy/> <li.toy/> <div> <div> <li.toy/> <li.toy/> </div> </div>
[21:42:44] <shoky> oops.
[21:42:49] <shoky> <div id=container> <div> <li.toy/> <li.toy/> </div> <div> <li.toy/> <li.toy/> </div> </div>
[21:43:13] <shoky> o o p s
[21:44:13] <shoky> Whirl3d can you elaborate
[21:46:02] <Whirl3d> Hey shoky! Sure. It's like this: <div id='thegoal'><div><ul><li class='toy' id='start'/></ul></div><div><ul><li class='toy' id='b'/></ul></div></div>
[21:47:32] <Whirl3d> so right now, I would go from a to ul to div to "theGoal" and each time I would check to see if there were other li.toy elements that weren't siblings of a, but still related...
[21:47:37] <Whirl3d> I'll make a fiddle. LOL
[21:58:50] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dHdQE/
[21:59:54] <Whirl3d> only works because we know the exact relationship and can get grandpa by parent()...or by closest(".grandpa")....or what have you. But I want to automatie the rocess to find the closest other "toy" for example
[22:08:03] <Acrack> hellow
[22:09:15] <Acrack> how to select the 3 first ?
[22:09:15] <Acrack> elem.find(".game-list-images:first").show();
[22:09:20] <Acrack> i can only select one
[22:09:30] <Whirl3d> hence the nature of :first
[22:09:37] <Acrack> ?
[22:09:43] <Acrack> what do u mean
[22:09:46] <Whirl3d> how many firsts can you have?
[22:10:05] <Acrack> what im trying to do is i have a loop that show 6 items
[22:10:09] <Acrack> i want to hide 3 ^^
[22:10:22] <Whirl3d> than the ""first" selector isn't going to help
[22:10:25] <Acrack> elem.find(".game-list-images").hide();
[22:10:25] <Acrack> elem.find(".game-list-images:first").show();
[22:10:33] <Acrack> i found this script ^^
[22:10:42] <Whirl3d> elem.find(".game-list-images").show();
[22:10:46] <Whirl3d> will show them all
[22:11:17] <Acrack> http://pastie.org/3862349
[22:11:20] <Whirl3d> when you add the :first selector, you are esentailly asking for ONE element...the first element
[22:11:37] <Whirl3d> line number?
[22:11:54] <Acrack> 17
[22:12:40] <Whirl3d> right.It selects the first element and stores a reference to it in this.elementCourant
[22:13:20] <Acrack> lemme show u a screenshot
[22:13:36] <Whirl3d> what are you not understanding?
[22:14:33] <Whirl3d> Once you have selected the first element, then you can use things like :next to get the next element
[22:14:37] <Acrack> http://i.tinyuploads.com/F2XKAd.png
[22:14:40] <Whirl3d> or prev to get the previous element
[22:14:51] <Acrack> the jquery script isn't what i exactly need ^^
[22:15:02] <Acrack> check screen i ll explain you i kinda need help to modif it a lil bit
[22:15:11] <Acrack> i have 6 games
[22:15:19] <Whirl3d> sure
[22:15:30] <Acrack> i should have game1 game2 game3 pictures with float left
[22:15:41] <Acrack> so 3 little blocks are you picturing it ^^ ?
[22:15:58] <Whirl3d> Do you understand what :first does?
[22:16:10] <Acrack> yes i do
[22:16:19] <Acrack> i don't think first is what i need here
[22:16:25] <Acrack> because i have 3 elements
[22:16:28] <Whirl3d> if you want the three images,than you want to select them like this:   $("img").lt(3);
[22:16:30] <Acrack> not just 1
[22:16:40] <Acrack> .lt ?
[22:16:46] <bartmax> lt = less than
[22:16:48] <Whirl3d> that will give you the first 3 images.
[22:16:50] <Whirl3d> yes
[22:16:51] <bartmax> starting at index 0
[22:17:05] <bartmax> so will return 0, 1 and 2.
[22:17:06] <Whirl3d> thanks. Sorry forgot that
[22:17:39] <bartmax> how are you Whirl3d ?
[22:17:49] <Whirl3d> good, thanks and you?
[22:18:16] <bartmax> fine, dealing with some connector stuff between mysql and entity framework ... you figure out. I like way better that jquery / knockout tasks :D
[22:18:55] <bartmax> so, im around here so i can at least read some js code ;)
[22:19:01] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:19:18] <Acrack> yep i see the 3 pictures :)
[22:19:28] <bartmax> Acrack: nicely done :D
[22:19:29] <Whirl3d> Acrack, you are going to want to keep track of one end of those three images...
[22:19:50] <Whirl3d> like the lower end. Then just keep track of it's index as you move them around.
[22:20:01] <Acrack> yea the slider is working anymore now
[22:20:08] <Acrack> i want to see the 3 following pictures
[22:20:08] <Acrack> xD
[22:20:24] <Acrack> if i push next and the 3 previous if i push previous
[22:21:05] <Whirl3d> gimme a minute to make a fiddle to show you.
[22:21:57] <Acrack> oki thanks a lot
[22:22:13] <zitter|mobile> hi, how to add a class every 5 <LIs>?
[22:23:10] <zitter|mobile> I have a UL with many LIs but I need to fix LI#5 li#10 li#15 and so on
[22:23:12] <zitter|mobile> any hint?
[22:23:13] <Acrack>   			 			 				:nth-child(N)
[22:23:17] <shoky> Whirl3d sorry im tired and your fiddle is making me dizzy ;P gnight!
[22:23:47] <Acrack> zitter|mobile: http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/ check this
[22:24:10] <Acrack> i found that some minutes ago maybe it can help never used it tho ^^
[22:24:24] <zitter|mobile> Acrack, thanks for the link
[22:24:48] <Acrack> np
[22:24:59] <Whirl3d> shoky, no problem. Sleep well.
[22:28:40] <zitter|mobile> Acrack, it worked with :nth-child(5n)
[22:29:01] <Acrack> cool :p
[22:31:25] <Whirl3d> Acrack, here is the basic stuff without the jquery...there are 6+ images but only 3 are visible
[22:31:39] <zitter|mobile> I have to pin a John Resig poster in my office lol :D
[22:32:00] <Acrack> Whirl3d: ok mate
[22:34:55] <Acrack> Whirl3d: i didn't see any link bro ^^
[22:37:34] <Whirl3d> gimme a second I am doing it now
[22:37:46] <Whirl3d> I only type about 200 wpm, so it's taking a minute sorry
[22:37:48] <Acrack> ah ok sorry ^^
[22:37:54] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:45:08] <Whirl3d> Gawd I hate CSS
[22:45:41] <Acrack> :D
[22:45:56] <systemfault> CSS is easy
[22:46:20] <Acrack> .game-list-container{	overflow:hidden; }
[22:46:25] <Acrack> i think you just need that no ?
[22:49:14] <Whirl3d> Acrack, I can't get previous button to work for some silly reason. But here is the idea
[22:49:21] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dHdQE/27/
[22:49:32] <Whirl3d> There's a lot of optimizing you could do, but it demonstrates the point
[22:49:50] <Acrack> lemme check :p
[22:50:18] <Whirl3d> wait, I messed something else up. LOL
[22:50:54] <Acrack> xD
[22:51:59] <Whirl3d> suddenly overflow:hidden stopped working
[22:52:42] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dHdQE/16/
[22:52:47] <Whirl3d> overflow:hidden works.
[22:53:24] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dHdQE/29/
[22:53:34] <Whirl3d> not sure what I changed in CSS,--it hates me
[22:54:04] <Whirl3d> systemfault, will you please look at this fiddle and figure out the stupid css probelm?
[22:54:06] <Acrack> but not buttons
[22:54:06] <Acrack> xD
[22:54:21] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Sure, what's wrong?
[22:54:48] <Whirl3d> I am not sure what combination of position:aboslute and position:relative and display:block, and you name it...
[22:55:06] <Whirl3d> I never get them right. I need to slide the slider to the right or left and suddenly it's not working.
[22:55:30] <systemfault> Ah, it's a slider
[22:55:45] <Whirl3d> just a quick example of how to display 3 images instead of one
[22:56:53] <Whirl3d> Basically, Acrack, you have to make sure that your window element is big enough to show 3 images. Then just keep track of the first image visible and either increment or decrement
[22:58:03] <Acrack> but this code isn't working no ? :x
[22:58:32] <Whirl3d> right. But it's a css issue.
[22:59:10] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dHdQE/30/

[22:59:48] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Is that the wanted effect?
[23:00:00] <systemfault> Ah..
[23:00:03] <systemfault> You also got it
[23:00:15] <systemfault> Great
[23:00:30] <Whirl3d> thanks for your help. I get so frustrated with CSS.
[23:00:49] <Acrack> weird i can't go back to A
[23:00:50] <Acrack> xD
[23:01:04] <systemfault> inline-block sucksâ€¦ You should forget about it :P
[23:01:20] <Acrack> ok anyway thanks guyz gonna sleep now ^^
[23:01:21] <Whirl3d> I setup my index wrong. Change the line that checks for prevind>0 so it says prevIndex>=0
[23:01:33] <Acrack> i ll make it work tomorow
[23:01:40] <Whirl3d> the nerve
[23:01:44] <Whirl3d> lol
[23:01:46] <Acrack> ?
[23:02:43] <Acrack> gn guyz thanks again Whirl3d
[23:04:03] <Whirl3d> sleep well.
[23:06:50] <Whirl3d> systemfault. Here is something weird. THough your version and mine are now pretty much identical, mine freaks out on the animation from time to time. Yours doesn't...any ideas?
[23:07:02] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dHdQE/37/
[23:08:09] <Whirl3d> wow. It's because of the anchor elements and inline-block. How weird.
[23:08:42] <systemfault> inline-block looks great in theory but is usually shit in practice.
[23:08:58] <Whirl3d> I will try to never use it again.
[23:09:46] <Whirl3d> but why should it mess up the slider?
[23:11:52] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Not sure.. I haven't taken the time to fully analyze your code to be honest...
