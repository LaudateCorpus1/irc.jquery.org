[00:00:44] <Technodrome> Cork: now you see why i'm in a bit of a pickle
[00:05:51] <Technodrome> and when the real limitation is noticed, and the only solution cannot be implemented Cork  you go afk =D
[00:35:27] <Adrick> can i get jquery mobile help here ?
[00:35:50] <xec> ?ask @ Adrick
[00:35:51] <b-ot> Adrick: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:36:32] <Adrick> wasn't sure if there was a seperate jquery mobile #
[00:40:59] <Adrick> when i call changePage in jquery mobile with a url its not firing my document.ready isn't been fired.
[00:41:41] <Adrick> i don't know that much about jquery mobile, so suspect changePage is doing ajax load or something instead of having window load the page.
[00:47:08] <lemonsparrow> I used localstorage to store huge data array in the front end to avoid continuous ajax calls... can that be termed as something done to improve scalability of a web application ?

[00:56:48] <abailarri> Hello. I implemented in my webapp a little jquery script to remove mysql rows via php and ajax. It works halfway, because it deletes well the rows, but don't do the ajax effect (the page reloadsm and I don't want it). Anyone can help me?
[01:06:36] <Zak> abailarri: you might want to pinpoint the problem a little more
[01:06:54] <Zak> are you submitting a form?
[01:10:02] <abailarri> Zak the jquery function that I have is to delete rows from a mysql table without reloading the web page (using ajax). Well, delete, yes it deletes rows of the table, but it not removes on html. To view the change, I need to reload the page, and this is precisely what I do not want to do.
[01:10:44] <abailarri> Zak: i'm not using a form, i'm using a button that pases some data to the jquery function and the jquery function pases this data to php action of delete
[01:18:47] <abailarri> Zak: do you undertstand me, no?
[01:32:26] <abailarri> Zak: I solved!
[01:33:48] <abailarri> anyone know some method to have link with # that not move to the top of page?
[01:35:03] <Cork> abailarri: don't use broken links with you just want a clickable element?
[01:35:46] <Cork> <span class="link" tabindex="0"></span> .link { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; cursor: pointer; }
[01:36:06] <Phlow> some frameworks, like kendo routes use # fragments to track SPA position/history
[01:39:54] <Koopz> i don't know why but everytime i use hrefs in jquery tabs my browser keeps on making requests on links which are directed to IDs...
[01:40:32] <Koopz> the page is loading itself into the tabs
[01:53:45] <xec> $('a[href="#"]').click(function(e){e.preventDefault()});
[01:55:30] <xec> Koopz: http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax
[01:55:38] <xec> Koopz: "Fetch external content via Ajax for the tabs by setting an href value in the tab links"
[02:00:58] <Koopz> I don't even need to click
[02:01:16] <Koopz> and if you look at the default example there are hrefs too
[02:01:34] <Koopz> only the content-divs are missing in the ajax example
[02:02:28] <xec> ?demo @ Koopz
[02:02:28] <b-ot> Koopz: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:25:01] <thegladiator> How do I remove an attribute called foo from the root node ?
[02:25:17] <thegladiator> parent and its children for a cleanup ?
[02:25:19] <Cork> node.foo == undefined;
[02:25:30] <Cork> or if you mean though attr
[02:25:34] <Cork> removeAttr('foo')
[02:25:45] <thegladiator> ok thanks let me check
[02:25:58] <thegladiator> will that remove node and its parent and is it jquery ? removeAttr ?
[02:26:03] <thegladiator> node and its child **
[02:26:13] <Cork> no just the first element
[02:26:24] <Cork> you will have to loop the list if you want it removed from more then one element
[02:26:46] <Cork> $('[foo]').each(function() { $(this).removeAttr('foo'); })
[02:27:07] <thegladiator> thanks Cork
[02:27:26] <thegladiator> I know its a span with class = "bar" , so I can query for that and do it too
[02:27:33] <thegladiator> loop over that list no ?
[02:27:42] <thegladiator> instaed of recursive queries
[02:27:49] <Cork> class is more then an attribute, so you don't need to do it that way
[02:27:58] <Cork> $('.bar').removeClass('bar')
[02:28:09] <Cork> or of you only want to match spans $('span.bar').removeClass('bar')
[02:28:17] <thegladiator> yes , no this is actually an attribute , call foo = 'something '
[02:28:30] <thegladiator> its actually data-mce-noneditable = true/false in TinyMCE
[02:28:48] <thegladiator> ty Cork I will try that
[02:34:14] <dwarder> i want to limit jsonp usage from server side, to allow jsonp to a certain domain
[02:34:18] <dwarder> is it possible
[02:34:18] <dwarder> ?
[02:34:57] <Cork> dwarder: well kinda
[02:35:09] <Cork> you would have to check the reference header
[02:35:19] <Cork> there might be a Origin too
[02:35:44] <dwarder> Cork: so, i should look in $_SERVER var for something usefull?
[02:35:51] <dwarder> ohh no
[02:35:52] <Cork> yes
[02:36:22] <dwarder> hmm, right, ok
[02:40:06] <Corrado> anyone know if i put the error message jqueryValidate in attr attribute'
[02:42:39] <Koopz> xec: i'm pretty sure now that it has something to do with setting a base href
[02:44:12] <Koopz> The hyperlinks are getting requested because they aren't the exact same urls with an anchor
[02:46:24] <martisj> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null
[02:46:35] <martisj> when doing 					point = jQuery(attribute).offset().top;
[02:47:36] <martisj> ah forget it
[02:47:41] <martisj> figured it out
[02:50:18] <Koopz> oh...great... no solution by jquery for supporting base-tags because reasons...
[02:50:50] <Cork> Koopz: there isn't really a need to use base tag so...
[02:51:16] <Cork> i was added back when ppl used static html pages, and edited them by hand
[02:56:24] <Koopz> that doesn't change the fact that applications sometimes still force them
[03:04:39] <Koopz> so the right thing you do today is putting the full URL to every single file you are referencing to?
[03:05:00] <Cork> well the absolute url at least
[03:05:12] <Cork> the domain has a valid reason to no be in there
[03:06:25] <Koopz> that's somewhat... unhandy if you ask me...
[03:10:47] <fuchstronaut> safari on my iPad 1 tells me "Object.defineProperty is not a function". do you know any workarounds?
[03:11:12] <Cork> fuchstronaut: the js in the browser is too old
[03:11:25] <Cork> and you can't use the new object functions
[03:11:46] <Cork> getter/setter syntax
[03:11:51] <Cork> uh..
[03:11:55] <fuchstronaut> I have a full application that runs perferctly in a browser, but now i have to make it work ith that ipad 1 i have here
[03:12:00] <Cork> * there might be support for the getter/setter syntax
[03:12:10] <fuchstronaut> i need a fallback
[03:12:24] <Cork> fuchstronaut: try getters/setters
[03:12:31] <Cork> if that doens't exist, you don't have one
[03:16:30] <jop008> what is good code to scrollinto view?
[03:16:46] <jop008> using jqMobile
[03:21:59] <dwarder> will beforeSend work with $.ajax   if    type: 'GET'
[03:23:39] <Cork> dwarder: as long as it isn't cross domain yes
[03:23:58] <dwarder> it is, thankx
[03:24:06] <fuchstronaut> Looks like older versions of ipad won't run with jquery >= 2
[03:28:19] <boytoy_> jop008: https://github.com/watusi/jquery-mobile-iscrollview ?
[03:30:36] <dwarder> Cork: i'm trying to send X-API-Key with $.ajax, my attempt is
[03:30:37] <dwarder> beforeSend: function (request)
[03:30:37] <dwarder>             {
[03:30:38] <dwarder>                 request.setRequestHeader("X-API-Key", 'my key');
[03:30:40] <dwarder>             },
[03:31:00] <dwarder> doesn't work
[03:31:02] <Cork> dwarder: don't dump code in the channel
[03:31:10] <dwarder> Cork: 4 lines, come on
[03:31:15] <Cork> no
[03:31:21] <Cork> don't do it
[03:31:27] <dwarder> ok
[03:31:46] <Cork> dwarder: and this isn't cross domain?
[03:31:55] <dwarder> Cork: it is
[03:31:57] <Cork> ...
[03:32:03] <Cork> <Cork> dwarder: as long as it isn't cross domain yes <--
[03:32:14] <Cork> you can't set headers in a script tag
[03:32:18] <Cork> so no it isn't possible
[03:32:21] <dwarder> ohh
[03:32:29] <dwarder> thanks
[03:35:18] <krambiorix> hi guys, how can i set a draggable element's width on start dragging?
[03:36:03] <Cork> krambiorix: i'm quite sure you can
[03:37:07] <krambiorix> Cork, me too, but how?
[03:37:23] <Cork> depends on how your dragging
[03:37:39] <krambiorix> Cork, from left to right :D :D
[03:37:43] <Cork> but i think there's an ui object with a reference to the element or something like that
[03:38:03] <Cork> krambiorix: haven't worked with it for quite some times so i don't fully remember
[03:38:08] <dwarder> jedi force would do this ;)
[03:38:55] <krambiorix> hmm
[03:40:47] <krambiorix> i put it in the start option $(".item").draggable({start: function(event) { ... set with ....}});
[03:41:04] <krambiorix> but that function doesn't give me an ui object
[03:43:45] <darkmutt> hey, a silly question here but, how do i select a clicked object via jquery?
[03:44:16] <Cork> "a clicked object"?
[03:44:27] <Cork> do you mean how to bind an event listener?
[03:47:02] <darkmutt> say you have an object A with html object B inside, you have multiple objects like that
[03:47:10] <darkmutt> how to you select which B is to be passed?
[03:47:31] <Cork> what?
[03:47:36] <Cork> passed??
[03:50:22] <Cork> darkc0met: you need to give the context the way you express it doesn't make any sense
[03:52:05] <darkmutt> http://jsbin.com/eBiGIle/1/edit check this please Cork i don't know how to express this better at the moment
[03:52:35] <Cork> ok?
[03:52:43] <Cork> and what is the question...?
[03:53:18] <Cork> is $(this) what you're looking for?
[03:53:52] <darkmutt> rather how to use $(this) in said example
[03:54:01] <Cork> darkmutt: btw binding a click event inside a hover event is a bad idea
[03:54:11] <darkmutt> yeah i noticed
[03:54:12] <Cork> it will duplicate the event evey time you hover
[03:54:56] <fuchstronaut> any ideas why change() fires twice on my stupid ipad
[03:55:18] <darkmutt> my point is how should I use $(this) so only the correct element is grabbed instead of always the first one
[03:56:38] <Cork> darkmutt: is this what your looking for? http://jsbin.com/eBiGIle/2/edit
[03:57:01] <Cork> fuchstronaut: form element?
[03:57:10] <fuchstronaut> input element
[03:57:15] <darkmutt> exactly the one cork, thank you a lot :)
[03:57:19] <Cork> fuchstronaut: replaced elements
[03:57:49] <Cork> fuchstronaut: safari mobile puts a overlay over input elements
[03:58:00] <Cork> and then fake triggers the same event on the original element
[03:58:40] <Tumulte> hey !
[03:58:45] <fuchstronaut> Cork: thanks, but what can i do about it?
[03:59:01] <fuchstronaut> my click event is just fired once
[03:59:05] <fuchstronaut> (as expected)
[03:59:20] <Cork> fuchstronaut: make your code handle it?
[03:59:38] <Tumulte> I'd like to have a player that play continuously. Seems like unobstusive AJAX is the way to go... IS there some existing stuffs for that already ?
[03:59:56] <fuchstronaut> how can i make my code handle elements i dont know about ?
[04:00:22] <Cork> fuchstronaut: i mean make it handle multiple change events without breaking
[04:00:44] <fuchstronaut> by breaking you mean return false?
[04:01:07] <Cork> no, i mean by not doing something wrong cause the event came twice
[04:01:41] <fuchstronaut> actually its a simple change event that is fired once on windows no matter what the browser is, it is firing it twice on the ipad
[04:23:09] <pagios_> hi i am getting this error: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[04:23:13] <pagios_> what could be rhe prob
[04:23:37] <Cork> pagios_: you haven't loaded the jquery library
[04:24:03] <pagios_> Cork:      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.18/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css">
[04:24:03] <pagios_>                 <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>              <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.18/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[04:24:52] <Cork> check so the resource is actually loading
[04:25:41] <pagios_> how can i do that
[04:25:50] <Cork> the browsers network console
[04:26:37] <pagios_> Cork i get [blocked] the page https://...  ran insecure content from http:jax.google etc
[04:26:56] <Cork> pagios_: are your page https?
[04:27:01] <pagios_> yes
[04:27:11] <Cork> make sure the call is the same
[04:27:25] <pagios_> should be https to google jquery?
[04:27:29] <Cork> yes
[04:31:15] <pagios_> Cork: i get now "invalid backend data is not json"
[04:34:38] <thegladiator> how to match a class name directly ?
[04:35:05] <thegladiator> $('span') gives me all span elements , I need spans with a particular class
[04:35:42] <thegladiator> $('a[class="foo"]') ?
[04:41:11] <seutje> thegladiator: $('a.foo')
[04:41:43] <seutje> $('a[class="foo"]') would only match those whose class attribute is *exactly* "foo", e.g., it wouldn't match <a class="foo bar"></a>
[04:43:01] <thegladiator> right thanks seutje thanks for the clarification
[04:44:37] <Cork> also don't forget you would do actual attribute selection not through the browser class hash
[04:44:42] <Cork> so it would be really slow
[04:53:23] <pagios_> anyone?
[04:53:27] <pagios_> Cork: i get now "invalid backend data is not json"
[04:54:12] <Cork> pagios_: from what?
[04:54:23] <pagios_> elFidner jquery plugin
[04:54:47] <djangonoob> is it good practice -not- to answer with a json response to call the error callback from $.ajax  (because of a parsing error?) ?
[04:55:31] <Cork> djangonoob: you mean the server fails to parse the json request?
[04:55:57] <Cork> pagios_: so you're sending something from your server that one of your plugins isn't expecting
[04:56:18] <pagios_> this my problem Cork https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/issues/520
[04:56:18] <b-ot> pagios_: Issue #520 by wh1t3r4bb1t (6mon 2w ago): Getting Error: Invalid backend response. Data is not JSON.
[04:56:50] <djangonoob> Cork: the error callback will be triggered if I have a $.ajax with datatype:json and the server dont send back json?
[04:57:06] <shoky> djangonoob: sounds like a bad idea
[04:57:27] <Cork> djangonoob: if you have server side problem send a 4xx or 5xx response
[04:57:57] <Cork> if you want to send validation errors you might be better of handling that in the success callback
[04:58:02] <Cork> depending on what your doing
[04:58:40] <djangonoob> Cork: it is a validation thing
[04:59:11] <Cork> djangonoob: then yes you can use http status to indicate that the data submitted was invalid
[04:59:13] <djangonoob> Cork: should I use a status flag and check this in success block?
[04:59:39] <Cork> but yes you should include a status/error/similar section in the json response
[05:02:03] <djangonoob> Cork: ok, thanks. I thought also on a 422, but I think I will send back a flag and check it in success
[05:14:53] <jonkristian_wrk> I am using jquery vegas slideshow and need to figure out if it's possible to return id or other defined attributes during the slideshow? http://pastie.org/8310608 The plugin I am using: https://github.com/jaysalvat/vegas
[05:22:30] <zhulikas> hey fellas
[05:22:33] <zhulikas> a JqGrid question
[05:22:48] <zhulikas> so I have rows... and a certain column is an object on its own
[05:22:59] <zhulikas> I use custom formatter to display certain property of that object
[05:23:16] <zhulikas> now how can I search over that object?
[05:23:24] <zhulikas> searchrules { custom_func doesn't seem to work
[05:23:39] <zhulikas> and I can only assume by default filtering is comparing given value with original value
[05:23:57] <zhulikas> which is [object Object]
[05:25:49] <Asmooh> anyone using jquert processbar? i have a perfectly working upload script, but it shows 1% till 100%, i wanted to do that as a processbar, so as value i use the same as inner html, only strange part i that it loads direct 100% even the upload is only at 5%
[05:27:34] <Cork> Asmooh: have you set the max value?
[05:28:06] <Asmooh> well i tried the html5 processbar and that didnt work at all so its using a div now
[05:28:07] <Asmooh> let me see
[05:28:10] <Cork> or made sure the value is between 1 and 100?
[05:28:19] <Asmooh> $(function() {
[05:28:19] <Asmooh>     $( "#progressbar" ).progressbar({
[05:28:19] <Asmooh>       value: percentComplete.toString()
[05:28:19] <Asmooh>     });
[05:28:19] <Asmooh>   });
[05:28:19] <Asmooh>   
[05:28:27] <Cork> ah
[05:28:28] <Asmooh> that will only be 0-100
[05:28:29] <Cork> there you have it
[05:28:30] <Asmooh> max
[05:28:37] <Cork> parseInt(, 10)
[05:29:02] <Asmooh> huh?
[05:29:12] <Cork> value should be a number, not a string
[05:29:30] <Asmooh> yea but that string gives a numper
[05:29:32] <Asmooh> 0-100
[05:29:40] <Asmooh> number*
[05:29:47] <Cork> js> print("10" + 1
[05:29:49] <Cork> js> print("10" + 1)
[05:29:57] <b-ot> Cork: 101
[05:30:02] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:30:03] <Cork> so no you want a number
[05:45:31] <anli> offset() returns null for an ul, does that mean it has no positioned parent?

[07:27:14] <duderion> hey guys, which parallax plugin would you recommend to build up a responsive parallax page ? or rather no plugin :)
[07:41:27] <BillCriswell> All that's essentially doing is repositioning a background image based on the scrollTop, right?
[07:42:08] <duderion> i want to scroll several images depending on the scrollTop position...
[07:42:28] <duderion> like fishes swimming from left to right and so on ;]
[07:42:51] <duderion> scroll=move
[07:43:03] <BillCriswell> As you scroll up and down?
[07:43:08] <duderion> yap
[07:43:34] <duderion> im currently checking http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/
[07:43:47] <duderion> looks good..
[07:44:41] <BillCriswell> May have just had a seizure!
[07:45:31] <BillCriswell> duderion: If this is documented well I'd just go for it.
[07:45:49] <duderion> at the end of the page, it's documented
[07:45:56] <duderion> its using greensock..
[07:46:58] <GreatPotato> I think I saw a new js/jquery script the other day that allowed easy modification to the DOM order? Anybody know the name? Can't find it now I need it!
[08:11:27] <`f`o`o`m`a`n> is there really any point of including both of these (which are identical in implementation—and kind of pointless anyway)? http://d.pr/jjNB
[08:11:53] <`f`o`o`m`a`n> maybe i am missing something...
[08:18:25] <Tumulte_> Hey !
[08:19:54] <Tumulte_> is their any ressources/plugin about non-obstrusive AJAX (for a continuous html5 player) ?
[08:20:15] <Tumulte_> Didn't find many relevant things
[08:20:23] <NoiseEee> Tumulte_: don't really understand what you mean
[08:21:14] <Tumulte_> NoiseEee: basically I'd like to "AJAXify" my links so a song won't stop at page change
[08:21:28] <NoiseEee> you mean song change instead of page change?
[08:22:07] <sunya7a> hello
[08:22:24] <sunya7a> does anyone know what happened to the wrapselection plugin? is there a substitute for it now?
[08:22:25] <Tumulte_> NoiseEee: I mean, the new page is loaded in a div/section/ instead of reloading
[08:22:41] <NoiseEee> Tumulte_: why would that interfere with the audio playing on the page?
[08:23:16] <Tumulte_> NoiseEee: cause clicking a link that changes a page will basically reset the player
[08:23:50] <NoiseEee> Tumulte_: well the audio player is irrelevent here isn't it?  you're just asking how to load new content in a particular <div> or similar?
[08:24:04] <NoiseEee> Tumulte_: the audio player being outside that element?
[08:25:50] <davve123_> hey. i have this long list of DOM elements (tbody:s) which i have implemented a pagination and sort by column functionality to. now i want to add filters to it, to lets say exclude those rows that have less than X in a certain column. doing this while not braeking the previous functionality im thinking i should deep copy (using .clone()) the entirety of the DOM elements then inject insert the filtered amount of them again. my question is where do i 
[08:25:51] <Tumulte_> NoiseEee: lemme try to put this straight. I got a working website for non-JS people, they can change pages using standard href. However, for people with JS, I'd add a player on top of the page, that I want to play continuously, no matter where they go. Therefor : non-obstrusive AJAX, that'd replace links by AJAX request
[08:26:15] <NoiseEee> Tumulte_: do an iframe.
[08:26:35] <NoiseEee> you can't load full <html> pages into a DOM element
[08:29:15] <davve123_> what i mean to do is do a deep copy and save it somewhere and based on the filter inject the qualified elements..
[08:29:33] <Bloomberg> Hi
[08:29:53] <Bloomberg> Someone could suggest me an uploader progress for my php script?
[08:30:14] <davve123_> Bloomberg: nprogress.js is pretty nice
[08:31:16] <Bloomberg> davve123_ : can I works with my php script with this plugin?
[08:31:40] <Tumulte_> NoiseEee: there's so much noise around iFrame... I'm undicided. There's a lot of super-anti-iframe... but it's as old as any other HTML element
[08:32:15] <davve123_> Bloomberg: sure, but you probably need to keep track of the progress clientside and in javascript
[08:32:37] <Bloomberg> man, can do you help me with this plz?
[08:32:55] <davve123_> sorry i got my own stuff to do
[08:33:02] <Bloomberg> Ok
[08:33:47] <NoiseEee> Tumulte_: 'noise' around it?  who cares if its old, it fits your specs exactly.
[08:33:51] <davve123_> the progress bar itself is simple to use
[08:33:56] <davve123_> and looks good
[08:34:04] <NoiseEee> Tumulte_: unless you want to rewrite the pages that get loaded by xhr/ajax so that they are just parts and not full html documents
[08:39:30] <davve123_> Bloomberg: best of luck
[08:40:57] <Bloomberg> davve123_ : Thank you so much man
[08:40:59] <Bloomberg> !1
[08:55:10] <krambiorix> how can i write this better? input.parent().find('.omschrijving')
[08:56:03] <jedimind> input.parents('.omschrivjasdgaging').eq(0)
[08:56:19] <shoky> hardly the same thing
[08:56:40] <jedimind> lol
[08:57:47] <shoky> krambiorix: without any other info to go on, you can't
[09:02:02] <YammYcoding> morning!
[09:02:59] <devkinetic> hello everyone, this seems like a simple question... I am using jquery ui 1.7 and i want to use one of the newer themes. is there a simple way to downgrade it?
[09:03:08] <YammYcoding> anyone knows any slider code that displays fullscreen and loads from xml with picture in background and some labels in front, for each pic?
[09:03:52] <DeltaHeavy> Not really a jQuery question but a general JS/web one. I'm using placeholder.js as a polyfill fallback. Problem is password field placeholders on my page are always showing up as astricks in IE8, while in IE9 is displays properly. Can anybody give me a hand? I can share the link via PM.
[09:06:23] <krambiorix> shoky, i want to get the sybling  input element with classname 'omschrijving'
[09:12:46] <shoky> `api siblings
[09:12:46] <b-ot> shoky: .siblings(): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[09:12:55] <shoky> krambiorix ^
[09:28:57] <anew> i'm baffled
[09:29:12] <anew> i have an input modified so users cannot enter spaces
[09:29:17] <anew> it works for me in all browsers
[09:29:22] <anew> yet it hasnt worked for one user yet
[09:29:27] <anew> let me paste the code
[09:29:59] <shoky> a jsfiddle would be x10000 better
[09:30:26] <shoky> as i'm sure you know by now
[09:30:44] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/pTGLa/
[09:30:52] <anew> yeah that's what i was going to do
[09:30:56] <anew> works in here also
[09:30:59] <anew> i dunnon wtf people are doing
[09:31:14] <shoky> works for me..
[09:31:20] <anew> baffling
[09:31:25] <shoky> what is
[09:31:32] <anew> why every user is entering spaces
[09:31:42] <anew> to much coincidence i think for everyont to have js turned off
[09:31:49] <shoky> what do you mean
[09:32:03] <anew> i mean it works for me, works for you... but it's not working for any users on the site
[09:32:14] <anew> everyone is entering stuff with spaces
[09:32:19] <anew> i mean that's what shows up in the database
[09:32:36] <shoky> got a link..?
[09:33:05] <anew> meh i will just fix it server side... u enter spaces, they get removed with php
[09:33:11] <anew> thx
[09:34:30] <grafi> well you should do that regardless, no?
[09:34:50] <anew> yeah but i mean if i am doing it client side(which works) why do it server side
[09:35:04] <shoky> cause you can't trust the client
[09:35:25] <shoky> and why do you say  "(which works)"  :)
[09:35:27] <anew> i'm too trustworthy
[09:35:29] <grafi> maybe less important for spaces ... but generally a good idea
[09:35:41] <anew> because it does work
[09:35:47] <shoky> then why are you here
[09:35:48] <grafi> the fiddle works for me too ^^
[09:37:10] <anew> shoky because it is not working for users
[09:37:21] <anew> i thought i just went over that... i am confuseed why it works for me, for you for grafi
[09:37:25] <anew> but not for users afaik
[09:37:30] <shoky> s/users/untrustworthy clients/
[09:37:31] <anew> i am not sitting behind someone when they are typing or turning off js
[09:38:39] <shoky> maybe they're all spambots ;p
[09:38:52] <shoky> space-loving spambots
[09:39:25] <DeltaHeavy> Can anybody recommend a good polyfill for placeholder fallback that works with password fields in IE8?
[09:39:51] <anew> true
[09:39:57] <anew> u might be onto something there actually
[09:40:06] <anew> perl programs ignore the js obv
[09:40:26] <NoiseEee> anew: this is why server-side validation.
[09:40:46] <shoky> spambots===perl?  gtk
[09:42:05] <anew> yeah all spambots are perl or python
[09:42:09] <anew> 99% no doubt
[09:48:18] <Skynet> hi does anyone knows plugin DRAGTABLE for table column sorting?
[09:48:42] <InDigital> hi does anyone knows plugin DRAGTABLE for table column sorting?
[09:49:20] <InDigital> script by akottr
[09:51:29] <blessYAHU> How would one set the document title in ie8 with jQuery?
[09:55:05] <InDigital> maybe someone has free script for table column dragging/sorting?
[09:56:49] <hamez> anyone else in here sitting in the jQuery training at the jQuery Conference?
[10:01:18] <BillCriswell> hamez: Nope.. in my office hating my job!
[10:09:10] <hamez> BillCriswell: sounds like time for a new one :)
[10:09:19] <BillCriswell> Haha, I concur.
[10:09:54] <BillCriswell> hamez: How is it? Good times?
[10:09:59] <BillCriswell> Learning a lot?
[10:11:56] <knuth> Hi guys, what IDE/Editor do you guys use for development?
[10:12:40] <hamez> It's pretty good. Mostly review for me so far, but I've picked up a couple of things (especially best practices). Looks like we're going to get to some more advanced stuff this afternoon.
[10:12:59] <hamez> knuth: vim
[10:13:25] <duch_kazatel> knuth: sublime text 2 + firebug/chrome's dev tools
[10:13:58] <tw2113> sublime text + firefox
[10:14:23] <hamez> ... and chrome dev tools
[10:14:35] <BillCriswell> hamez: Is it like.. basic training or more advanced stuff?
[10:15:00] <BillCriswell> I feel like I wouldn't benefit from it but I'm probably wrong as usual.
[10:18:27] <knuth> Thoughts on the webstorm IDE from jetbrains?
[10:25:29] <hamez> BillCriswell: It started out fairly basic, but it's getting more advanced. It's pretty fast pace. The presenter (http://weblog.bocoup.com/author/dan-heberden/) said this is basically a two-day course crammed into one day.
[10:26:12] <NoiseEee> knuth: good stuff
[10:26:32] <BillCriswell> hamez: Nice!
[10:27:03] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Do you use that?
[10:27:20] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: i do
[10:27:41] <BillCriswell> What was your previous editor?
[10:27:53] <NoiseEee> just souped-up notepad++ i think
[10:27:58] <NoiseEee> been with jetbrains for 2 years now
[10:28:06] <BillCriswell> Good stuff.
[10:28:31] <BillCriswell> Ever try out sublime? Curious to hear from people who have moved from SublimeText to WebStorm
[10:29:30] <BillCriswell> Realize the two are tough to compare, but still haha.
[10:29:41] <NoiseEee> never tried it, but i know people love it
[10:30:53] <BillCriswell> I used to use TextMate, then I moved to Sublime, almost no difference.
[10:31:20] <BillCriswell> Besides Sublime being a little bit better ( in my opinion ).
[10:41:55] <BillCriswell> Iggy & The Stooges put me in a much better mood.
[11:13:17] <Andrevan> vim + plugins
[11:13:58] <blindMoe> Donuts + coffee
[11:14:06] <BillCriswell> Andrevan: I feel so lost in vim.  It's definitely a hell of a learning curve.
[11:14:25] <Andrevan> BillCriswell: I had the benefit of working for a pairing shop when I was learning vim
[11:15:09] <BillCriswell> Andrevan: I bet that would help out a whole lot.
[11:15:33] <Andrevan> yes, and I also means my vim config is a little unusual
[11:15:36] <Andrevan> it*
[11:17:31] <BillCriswell> Andrevan: I wouldn't even know how that works. I can modify the JSON for SublimeText but that's about it.
[11:18:44] <BillCriswell> for the SublimeText config*
[11:19:05] <Andrevan> BillCriswell: there are several tools for vim plugins, one is called pathogen, another is vundle
[11:19:58] <Tomashe> Yo... wassup guys
[11:20:34] <BillCriswell> Andrevan: is there like a package manager or anything for it like sublime text has?
[11:20:46] <Tomashe> i was wondering something , im using this jquery http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html , in that one i got end time.. how do i calculate php timestamp time into this time syntax to match it ?
[11:22:42] <Tingle> Im trying to figure out what the state of a input checkbox is by doing $(this).val() on the "change()" callback
[11:23:01] <Andrevan> BillCriswell: yeah they are sort of like package managers, to install a plugin you just go to the "bundle/" dir and git clone the repository
[11:23:08] <Tingle> but it keeps returning 'on'
[11:23:15] <blar1> is it possible to access version-specific documentation for the jquery api?  specifically, the 1.5.1 specs for jqxhr
[11:23:24] <Andrevan> I think vundle even supports adding plugins by listing them in a file
[11:23:49] <blar1> the current docs spell out what has changed since given versions, but i'm trying to find what the api actually was for version 1.5.1
[11:23:53] <BillCriswell> Andrevan: Bad ass.
[11:24:30] <Andrevan> BillCriswell: github.com/andrewfader/vim-config if you're interested, mine is kind of messy, but I think Square has one called maximum-awesome that looks pretty good
[11:25:31] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: You could do like... new Date( <?php echo $timestamp ?> * 1000 ) perhaps?
[11:25:34] <BillCriswell> Think that's right.
[11:26:40] <BillCriswell> Andrevan: This makes so much sense.
[11:27:55] <BillCriswell> Tingle: Have some code to show?
[11:28:03] <knuth> anyone use vim on amazon servers?
[11:28:14] <knuth> best way to update it for php/python/jquery?
[11:29:14] <BillCriswell> Tingle: That's the default value for a checkbox.
[11:29:33] <BillCriswell> You probably want to test $(this).prop('checked');
[11:30:50] <BillCriswell> That value is only sent to the server when it's submitted if it's checked.
[11:44:28] <Tingle> thanks BillCriswell
[11:44:35] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[11:45:28] <Tingle> also, any idea how to get the 'option' from a <selec> that is selected? $('.profileInformationBody option[selected=""]') doesnt seem to work
[11:45:55] <BillCriswell> Tingle: Do you need the value of the select?
[11:46:03] <Tingle> yes
[11:46:11] <BillCriswell> Tingle: You can just do $('select').val()
[11:46:53] <Tingle> returns undefined
[11:47:23] <Tingle> ah nvm
[11:47:27] <Tingle> that worked nicely
[11:47:29] <Tingle> thanks alot
[11:54:31] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:08:36] <kflorence> IE10 focus issue for textareas: http://larryzhao.com/test.html -- anyone seen this one before?
[12:09:17] <saml> how do I cors?
[12:09:36] <saml> jQuery.ajax(url, {})
[12:09:39] <saml> browser gives me error
[12:17:22] <BillCriswell> saml: DId you try Googling it? There's a lot of different ways to accomplish it.
[12:18:16] <trinode> in jqm I'm using a panel for navigation, trying to remove some of the lag by handling vclick and using changePage to switch url, calling changePage though changes page without sliding off the menu as would happen if I let the normal click event fire
[12:18:29] <saml> Origin http://localhost:5000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[12:18:41] <saml> but response is Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[12:18:45] <saml> has that header
[12:18:47] <trinode> any idea how to trigger the normal slideout / changepage code?
[12:23:02] <blar1> is the documentation for older versions of jquery available anywhere (outside of internet archive)?  i'm trying to find the v1.5.1 api for jqxhr
[12:53:44] <doug65536> blar1 seriously? I put jquery 1.5.1 docs in google and it was right there
[13:00:17] <Asmooh> hello, i have a issue, when i upload a photo jquery 'clicks' 2 times
[13:48:19] <raj> how can I use a value returned within the clickhandler of .on()?
[13:49:22] <duch_kazatel> $('#mySelector').on('click', function(){/* Do your magic here. */})
[13:49:30] <raj> I'm aware
[13:49:50] <raj> but I have a 3rd party plugin that has a custom event, and it returns an element
[13:49:54] <raj> I'm wondering how that can be used
[13:50:10] <duch_kazatel> it returns an element?
[13:50:15] <raj> ya
[13:50:32] <duch_kazatel> ... does it provide a way to reference a callback on completion?
[13:51:10] <duch_kazatel> what's the plugin?
[13:51:47] <raj> yes, I see what happens
[13:52:05] <raj> it uses the return value to update its `data`
[13:52:30] <duch_kazatel> i'd need to see an example because this is like js101 to me, so I'm not sure where your confusion is...
[13:55:59] <zerokarmaleft> how can I list the current handlers on a node for a particular event?
[13:57:12] <duch_kazatel> zerokarmaleft http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518421/jquery-find-events-handlers-registered-with-an-object
[13:58:09] <zerokarmaleft> duch_kazatel: awesome, thanks...my google-fu wasn't taking me anywhere close to that for some reason
[13:58:31] <duch_kazatel> lol i just searched: jquery get current event handlers
[14:01:40] <fission6> i want to drag and drop an image from one div into another when i do i want it to fire a jquery event and do a few things with the item dragged, call an ajax method with some attributes of it

[14:12:39] <Xaro> Hi peeps
[14:12:40] <Xaro> anyone in
[14:13:29] <jdeeburke> Xaro: what's up/
[14:14:09] <ylandsman> I am developing a website where I am loading a dialog via ajax.  I would like to place previous and next buttons on each side of the dialog to trigger loading a different record into the dialog.  What would be the best way to go about this?
[14:14:24] <Xaro> I have the following code
[14:14:46] <Xaro> unction SSRadial_widgetlist()
[14:14:58] <Xaro> function SSRadial_widgetlist()
[14:15:11] <Xaro> ok let me repost
[14:15:20] <Xaro> function SSRadial_widgetlist()
[14:15:27] <Xaro> Thats the object declare
[14:16:04] <Xaro> I want to add a varible to the object that I can store a another object to
[14:16:24] <Xaro> eg: $(this).unique = new steelseries.Radial(id, {
[14:16:33] <Xaro> that being withing the each loop
[14:18:12] <jdeeburke> Xaro: I have no idea what you're asking
[14:19:51] <Xaro> ah its ok i need to go read up on it
[14:20:05] <Xaro> no use just using shortcut :{
[14:22:49] <KWhat_Work> Does anyone know of something similar to http://livepipe.net/control/scrollbar for jquery ?
[14:24:02] <Agamemnus> does jquery provide a way to modify CSS class data?
[14:24:26] <KWhat_Work> Agamemnus: no but you can add extra CSS
[14:24:30] <KWhat_Work> or classes
[14:24:37] <KWhat_Work> s/add/add and remove
[14:24:44] <Agamemnus> k thanks
[14:25:40] <TheGallery> KWhat_Work, I am using http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/ in one of my projects
[14:27:20] <KWhat_Work> TheGallery: thanks this looks promising.
[14:32:44] <krambiorix> hi, i use this to filter my autocomplete source: var matcher = new RegExp($.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex(request.term), "i");   -> how can i change this so when i type for exampl '1' , that it filters all strings BEGINNING with 1 ?
[14:32:55] <krambiorix> instead of containing  1
[14:37:05] <anli> Can a mvc action get the order of postdata?
[14:37:15] <anli> oops, wrong channel
[14:58:44] <Tingle2> is there anyway to get a function set through click()?
[14:58:52] <Tingle2> so basicly get the click function
[15:14:44] <Agamemnus> what's a better way of doing this?
[15:14:47] <Agamemnus> $(all_the_children.get(i))
[15:14:53] <Agamemnus> eg: I want the Nth item
[15:14:58] <Agamemnus> or rather, the Ith item
[15:15:13] <Agamemnus> .. as a jquery object
[15:15:21] <Agamemnus> or is there no such object?
[15:15:37] <Tingle2> is there some function I can use to temporarily make a div unclickable and clickable again without knowing the original function?
[15:16:49] <pixelpimp> Agamemnus: .eq() ?  maybe :nth-child() in the selector, even
[15:17:18] <Agamemnus> i guess the question is
[15:17:32] <pixelpimp> Tingle2: would be easy to bind the event handler to another function, then bind it back later
[15:17:40] <Agamemnus> when I have a jquery object, does it create sub-jquery objects for each DOM child?
[15:17:56] <Agamemnus> or would that be silly?
[15:18:06] <pixelpimp> I think only if you try to access them
[15:18:14] <Agamemnus> K
[15:18:15] <Agamemnus> thanks
[15:18:24] <Tingle2> pixelpimp, how do I do that?
[15:18:26] <pixelpimp> I'm sure it's pretty aware of how the DOM is structured
[15:18:36] <Tingle2> how do I get and set a eventhandler
[15:18:37] <pixelpimp> but I don't really know specifics on the internals
[15:19:46] <pixelpimp> Tingle2: something like - obj.oldHandler = obj.eventHandler; obj.eventHandler = newHandler;
[15:22:11] <dwarder> what is DSL?
[15:22:34] <pixelpimp> put that term in context?

[15:22:51] <dwarder> https://github.com/lucaong/jquery-machine
[15:24:08] <pixelpimp> haven't the foggiest.  ;)
[15:24:14] <pixelpimp> google says "Domain Specific Language"

[15:40:37] <Chriss_> http://pastebin.com/KPPXZsja    php form validation , when the validation fails it open the same form again , but when it succeds it redirects. the form is inside a colorbox so the redirect loads inside the colorbox
[15:41:26] <Chriss_> I need to run an if form validated redirect to urk otherwise open the same page inside the same colobox
[15:42:24] <Chriss_> any pointers ?
[15:54:03] <KWhat_Work> is max-hight a fucking property or a bullshit suggestion to CSS ?
[15:54:29] <snover> how high?
[15:54:41] <KWhat_Work> snover: does much matter
[15:54:44] <KWhat_Work> it surpasses it
[15:54:54] <snover> high as the sky?
[15:55:07] <pixelpimp> KWhat_Work: it is a property that is well supported
[15:55:15] <pixelpimp> Even IE7 supports it
[15:55:22] <KWhat_Work> there we go
[15:55:33] <KWhat_Work> something was overriding me
[15:55:47] <KWhat_Work> soooo painfully frustrating

[16:20:41] <Tingle2>                         sLastPage = sPage;
[16:20:41] <Tingle2>                         $('main div.main').empty();
[16:20:54] <Tingle2> what im trying to to backup stuff inside div.main
[16:21:02] <Tingle2> then empty main and load something else
[16:21:23] <Tingle2> maybe even the same stuff again, doesnt matter - but something seems wrong
[16:21:44] <Tingle2> is html() the wrong function
[16:28:23] <Ziber> I'm trying to use the sortable plugin, but having trouble figuring out nesting of ul/lis.
[16:28:26] <Ziber> *UL/LIs.
[16:33:02] <coldhead> Ziber: you might need to be specific with your selectors using the > character
[16:33:15] <coldhead> and confinement arguments to keep certain lis inside certain uls
[16:33:19] <coldhead> if that's what you're getting at
[16:33:33] <Ziber> I don't quite understand the effect ">" has.
[16:33:46] <Ziber> I'm working on nesting UL/LIs now.
[16:33:58] <coldhead> ul>li means ONLY lis within that ul
[16:34:04] <coldhead> immediately within*
[16:34:12] <coldhead> more useful with a class
[16:34:20] <coldhead> ul.parenty > li
[16:34:40] <coldhead> would match <ul><li class="thisguy"></li></ul>
[16:34:47] <Ziber> Here. http://sandbox.jkode.us/index.php See the JS at the bottom.
[16:35:46] <Ziber> Oh. "immediately within".
[16:35:47] <Ziber> I see.
[16:36:15] <abjorn> coldhead what up homie
[16:39:56] <pixelpimp> <a><b><b></b></b></a> - a > b will match the outer b but not the inner b
[16:40:09] <Ziber> Ah, I see. That makes sense.
[16:40:24] <pixelpimp> whereas `a b' matches both
[16:40:33] <abjorn> what am i even looking at
[16:40:47] <pixelpimp> magic
[16:49:20] <Tingle2> i think im doing this wrong, im trying to duplicate a object, this seems wrong:
[16:49:21] <Tingle2> aPersonalInfo = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(aPersonalInfoNew));
[16:59:03] <Ziber> I have .sortable() on my http://sandbox.jkode.us/index.php page. Trying to be able to sort the two lists, horizontally, as well as their items.
[16:59:11] <Ziber> But I can't seem to figure it out.
[17:00:23] <_rgn> Tingle2: var newObject = jQuery.extend({}, oldObject);
[17:23:06] <LiENUS> so anyone got a swanky jquery plugin to set my webpage background to match the weather/sunposition?
[17:24:52] <snover> no
[17:25:01] <LiENUS> well spit
[17:25:12] <LiENUS> i should ought write one
[17:25:22] <LiENUS> i have the sunrise/set code sort of done heh
[17:25:41] <duch_kazatel> LiENUS where are you getting your data from?
[17:25:46] <duch_kazatel> and how are you geocoding for the enduser?
[17:26:02] <LiENUS> duch_kazatel, i just hacked together a quick f.lux simulation that does the hsl for a white background and im geocoding wouldnt work at all
[17:26:10] <LiENUS> im using an array of l values for each hour atm
[17:26:53] <LiENUS> in theory getting sunrise/sunset data wouldnt be too difficult for 90% of the world
[17:27:14] <LiENUS> it gets difficult when you have areas too far north where the sun doesnt set or rise though
[17:27:26] <duch_kazatel> LiENUS sure, how do you reconcile that in Javascript ;)
[17:28:22] <shoky> also, ceilings
[17:28:37] <shoky> and big trees.
[17:29:32] <LiENUS> duch_kazatel, how so? i just do...
[17:29:43] <LiENUS> $(document.body).css('background', 'hsl(24, 100%, ' + colors[dt.getHours()] + '%)');
[17:29:57] <LiENUS> where dt is a Date() and colors[] is an array with 24 values one for each hour of the day
[17:30:43] <duch_kazatel> that's right - javascript returns local time.
[17:30:46] <duch_kazatel> i forget that.
[17:30:47] <LiENUS> obviously it could be way better, i just did it for the heck of it
[17:30:50] <duch_kazatel> wait does it?
[17:30:57] <LiENUS> what other time would it return?
[17:31:13] <duch_kazatel> GMT
[17:31:24] <LiENUS> lol
[17:31:38] <LiENUS> you sound like you think javascript was designed from the ground up to be intelligent
[17:32:22] <LiENUS> i'm sure theres got to be a way to find either GMT or your timezone with js (and either could be used to find the other) but nah dates are pretty standard to have local time
[17:32:50] <duch_kazatel> err, well in javascript they do everything based on the client machine, so it's whatever time the client is set to.
[17:33:08] <duch_kazatel> i'm used to having to handle timezone conversions, so all the backend I did was run in GMT as a result.
[17:34:41] <LiENUS> i really oughta do some actual sunset calculations
[17:35:26] <LiENUS> its for a veterinary clinic's record software though i really wanna get cats and dogs to fall in the background when it rains heh
[17:35:30] <abjorn> using my phone as a wifi hotspot in lieu of a stable internet connection really sucks
[17:35:58] <LiENUS> abjorn, bluetooth tethering ftw!
[17:36:07] <duch_kazatel> LiENUS if my wife had that kind of feature in her software she'd get frustrated quick.
[17:36:14] <abjorn> my laptop and desktop don't have bluetooth so
[17:36:19] <abjorn> but that wouldn't be much better anyways
[17:36:37] <abjorn> it's my at&t coverage and speeds that suck
[17:36:57] <Ziber> I'm playing around with .sortable(), on http://sandbox.jkode.us/index.php, and I'm trying to sort the lists' items and the lists themselves. Would someone mind helping me?
[17:41:55] <shoky> Ziber: you need to run .sortable() on the container
[17:42:09] <LiENUS> duch_kazatel, they wont use the new version despite that it has autocomplete, better reporting engine, more consistent ui and a buncha other stuff
[17:42:12] <LiENUS> they say its not user friendly
[17:42:15] <LiENUS> because its too plain...
[17:43:36] <Ziber> shoky: So like now?
[17:44:42] <shoky> Ziber:  $("ul").sortable({ items: "> li:not(.header)" })
[17:45:08] <Ziber> Hm. Alright. Let's try that.
[17:45:42] <Ziber> Ooooh. thanks!
[17:45:55] <Ziber> Forgot about "items:"
[17:46:07] <Ziber> What's the terminology for what "items:" is called in this case?
[17:46:18] <shoky> an option?
[17:46:27] <Ziber> Oh, thought it might have a fancy name.
[17:46:30] <shoky> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-items
[17:46:31] <shoky> ;p
[17:57:05] <LiENUS> so my ltimate plan for this app is to do smart card based authentication using touchless cards using nfc or something
[17:57:17] <LiENUS> i should put an easter egg that'll let you play tetris or solitare or something
[17:57:22] <LiENUS> and have it follow your authentication token around
[17:57:40] <LiENUS> so pull up one machine start playing, boss comes around so you pause real quick, go to another computer pull it back up and its got your spot on the other computer
[18:20:57] <ylandsman> Is there a way to disable one of the buttons in a dialog after initialization?
[18:22:17] <pixelpimp> .attr('disabled', true)
[18:22:47] <aMoniker> Using .remove() only removes an element from the DOM, but any variable containing a jQuery object still contains that element.
[18:22:56] <aMoniker> How do I remove it from the jquery wrapper?
[18:23:18] <aMoniker> I could delete $foo[0]; $foo.length = 0;
[18:23:22] <aMoniker> but I'm wondering if there's a kosher way
[18:39:19] <codepython777> I would like toplay a video in <video> and keep it mobile friendly. Has anyone done this here?
[19:06:47] <ghena1986>  http://bit.ly/183GBEv
[19:09:30] <Manusoftar> i have an input type hidden (id="ventana") i want to set/get it's value through jquery, is this right? $('#ventana').val("Something");
[19:09:52] <adavia> Manusoftar:  si
[19:10:07] <Manusoftar> adavia: do you speak spanish?
[19:10:21] <adavia> Manusoftar:  claro
[19:10:33] <RRR2> Pero porque
[19:10:59] <Manusoftar> adavia: que bien, es la primera vez que me encuentro con alguien más que habla español en este canal!
[19:11:30] <RRR2> Es una buena hablar español en un canal que no lo hace?
[19:11:31] <adavia> Y si.. uno se acostumbra a hablar en ingles
[19:11:33] <RRR2> No lo creeria
[19:11:39] <RRR2> buenaidea*
[19:11:44] <RRR2> buena idea**
[19:12:00] <adavia> RRR2:  en realiad el 2% habla español en freenode
[19:12:08] <Manusoftar> adavia: de cualquier modo seguiré en inglés por si alguien más quiere enterarse de lo que hablamos.
[19:12:26] <RRR2> adavia: el 83% de estadisticas son inventadas :p
[19:12:32] <Manusoftar> y eso que el español es el segundo idioma más hablado en el mundo, después del ingles claro!
[19:12:39] <adavia> RRR2:  puede ser
[19:13:03] <adavia> Pero cuando de programacion se trata mejor el ingles
[19:13:33] <Manusoftar> somehow doing $('#ventana').val("something"); and then $('#ventana').val(); returns undefined! (through firebug)
[19:13:40] <RRR2> Yo apoyo la idea de que para estudiar programacion no se necesita estudiar el idioma ingles, ya que programacion se trata de logica no de lenguage.
[19:14:13] <Manusoftar> pero las sentencias, casi siempre, están en inglés, sabiendo inglés es más facil entender las sentencias
[19:14:34] <adavia> Manusoftar:  proba con .html
[19:14:43] <Manusoftar> ?
[19:15:04] <RRR2> Lamentable es cierto en la mayoria de los lenguages de programacion, las unicas excepciones son lenguajes esotericos, +ASM
[19:15:20] <RRR2> I think I'm distracting you too much
[19:15:23] <RRR2> welp
[19:15:36] <Manusoftar> o lenguajes "jeroglíficos" APL X(
[19:16:11] <adavia> El problema es ese sino del soporte que hay en el tema.. y la mayoria es en ingles
[19:16:18] <adavia> no es*
[19:17:00] <Manusoftar> ok volviendo a lo que nos compete, no le encuentro la vuelta.
[19:17:09] <Manusoftar> somehow doing $('#ventana').val("something"); and then $('#ventana').val(); returns undefined! (through firebug)
[19:19:36] <T13|sleeps> Umm. Yeah.
[19:20:11] <T13|sleeps> Did #ventana have a value when the page loaded?
[19:20:55] <T13|sleeps> If not why would expect it to return a value?
[19:21:44] <ross`> http://dev.foo.mx/?l=guest
[19:21:52] <T13|sleeps> $( '#ventana' ).val( 'foo' ); doesn't set a static value.
[19:21:52] <ross`> http://dev.foo.mx/assets/js/header.js
[19:22:13] <ross`> how do i make it so that it updates the two divs to show the login and register buton
[19:22:22] <Manusoftar> it doesnt but i force a value (i guess) when i do $('#ventana').val("something"); ?
[19:22:26] <ross`> when both the login_username and login_password has a value
[19:22:34] <adavia> Manusoftar:  http://jsfiddle.net/HknRg/
[19:22:40] <T13|sleeps> Yes, until the command is over.
[19:23:11] <T13|sleeps> You would have to do both in the same command to return a value...  ie
[19:24:15] <T13|sleeps> $( '#ventana' ).val( 'foo' );$( '#ventana' ).val();
[19:24:25] <T13|sleeps> All in one shot.
[19:24:52] <T13|sleeps> That "should" return foo
[19:26:14] <T13|sleeps> Make sense Manusoftar? ??
[19:26:24] <ross`> T13|sleeps: can you help me with my probelm
[19:26:26] <ross`> problem*
[19:26:45] <ross`> i want the onkey to be activated by either field div
[19:26:55] <Manusoftar> it makes sense but the thing is it says its undefined :S
[19:27:00] <T13|sleeps> I'll try.  Code is hard to read at 240×320 px
[19:27:02] <ross`> when activated it checks if either is not null
[19:27:12] <ross`> if both are not null
[19:27:17] <ross`> it should add the button codes
[19:27:20] <ross`> for the login and register buttons
[19:28:00] <ross`> This is my first time using jquery :O
[19:28:07] <adavia> Manusoftar:  te fijaste en ese ejemplo?
[19:28:57] <ross`> i'm sure my error is very simple, my code doesn't do very much
[19:29:40] <T13|sleeps> ross`: why are you putting elements inside the value parameter of another element?
[19:30:02] <ross`> i've never used jquery before
[19:30:08] <ross`> i thought that was how you laid out stuff
[19:30:21] <ross`> i want that code to run if either selector has onkeyup
[19:31:13] <ross`> oh wait
[19:31:16] <ross`> i think i know what is wrong
[19:31:19] <T13|sleeps> Create the elements before hand with style="display: none;"
[19:31:59] <ross`> hmm
[19:32:04] <ross`> can you tell me why the code still isn't working
[19:32:07] <ross`> i fixed something obvious
[19:32:17] <T13|sleeps> Then just turn the buttons on with $( '#id' ).css( 'display', 'inline' );
[19:32:25] <doug65536> what code? (I just got here)
[19:32:34] <T13|sleeps> Or block or whatever works.
[19:32:54] <ross`> T13|sleeps: okay i'll try that
[19:33:47] <ross`> T13|sleeps: do i need to escape "" inside .val() by the way
[19:33:53] <ross`> i know i had to do that with regular js
[19:33:56] <doug65536> no
[19:34:12] <T13|sleeps> Just alternate ' & "
[19:34:28] <doug65536> you don't need to escape
[19:34:52] <T13|sleeps> 'Blah="foo"'
[19:35:07] <ross`> okay, my code may not be the best way to do it
[19:35:10] <T13|sleeps> Or "blah='foo'"
[19:35:12] <ross`> but i really want to know why it isn't working
[19:35:16] <ross`> it should work
[19:35:40] <T13|sleeps> It's easier to test that stuff in a jsfiddle btw
[19:35:59] <ross`> it's hard to port the whole thing into jsfiddle ;O
[19:36:10] <ross`> jsfiddle needs an import function
[19:36:14] <ross`> where youc an import from a url
[19:36:24] <ross`> and it cuts up the code into readable sections
[19:38:02] <ross`> can someone just tell me why my code doesn't change the value of <div id="login_button"></div>
[19:38:15] <ross`> http://dev.foo.mx/assets/js/header.js
[19:38:20] <ross`> there isn't that much code to look at
[19:38:23] <ross`> four lines
[19:38:27] <T13|sleeps> It does...
[19:38:35] <T13|sleeps> Problem is...
[19:38:51] <ross`> the buttons don't show up
[19:38:52] <ross`> :O
[19:38:58] <T13|sleeps> It's not the val() that needs changing.
[19:39:03] <ross`> oh
[19:39:05] <ross`> what needs changing
[19:39:12] <T13|sleeps> It's the .text() or .html()
[19:39:16] <ross`> okay!
[19:39:32] <T13|sleeps> .text() works with xml .html() does not
[19:39:56] <ross`> k
[19:40:04] <ross`> using .text() since i'm xhmlt
[19:40:05] <ross`> xhtml
[19:40:12] <T13|sleeps> Good idea.
[19:40:23] <ross`> okay still not working
[19:40:52] <ross`> when inspecting the elements the div is completely empty still
[19:41:19] <aro> how do i get an elements left offset from its parent
[19:41:21] <aro> ?
[19:41:58] <ross`> this still doesn't work
[19:42:02] <ross`> i got rid of the form code
[19:42:08] <T13|sleeps> Meh.. I'm getting too tired, I'm sure doug65536 can help you. :)
[19:42:09] <ross`> and just put 'foo' and 'bar'
[19:42:21] <ross`> doug65536: you there mate ^.^
[19:42:24] <doug65536> yes
[19:42:30] <doug65536> aro: position().left
[19:43:14] <aro> that returns 0
[19:43:50] <aro> oh nvm
[19:43:51] <doug65536> aro: what is the 'display' of it? display: none objects have no position
[19:43:51] <aro> got it :)
[19:43:54] <aro> thanks
[19:43:56] <aro> $('.toggle-user-menu').parents('li').position().left
[19:44:02] <aro> had to use the parents('li')
[19:44:18] <doug65536> ross`: hi
[19:44:44] <aro> perfect now
[19:44:46] <doug65536> ross`: val() is for form elements
[19:45:01] <ross`> doug65536: they are form elements
[19:45:40] <ross`> <div id="login_form"><form name="login" action="http://dev.foo.mx/?l=y" method="post"><div id="login_button"></div><input id="login_user" type="text" name="us" /><input id="login_password" type="password" name="pw" /><div id="register_button"></div></form></div>
[19:45:55] <doug65536> your selector is wrong
[19:46:12] <ross`> it is?
[19:46:15] <doug65536> ross`: $('#login_user, #login_password').keyup(function()    <-- do that
[19:47:01] <ross`> k, i fixed that
[19:47:08] <ross`> still isn't working
[19:47:44] <doug65536> where is the script tag that pulls that in? in head?
[19:47:48] <ross`> yes sir
[19:47:58] <ross`> http://dev.foo.mx/?l=guest
[19:47:58] <doug65536> that's your problem. nothing exists yet there
[19:48:05] <ross`> ?
[19:48:14] <ross`> oh wait
[19:48:18] <doug65536> wrap it in this: $(function() { ... your code ... });
[19:48:19] <ross`> so wher do i want the <script> then
[19:48:33] <doug65536> ross`: keep it there
[19:48:34] <doug65536> fix the js
[19:48:34] <ross`> i'm confused
[19:48:50] <ross`> let me see if i know what you mean.. one sec
[19:49:06] <doug65536> ok, jquery has a concise way to say, "run this when the document is ready". $(function() { ... runs when document ready ... });
[19:49:24] <ross`> like this?
[19:49:33] <doug65536> exactly
[19:49:50] <ross`> it works!
[19:49:51] <ross`> thanks man
[19:49:55] <doug65536> yw
[19:49:56] <ross`> that was my first time ever using jquery
[19:49:57] <ross`> xD
[19:50:43] <tw2113> now you're hooked for life
[19:51:23] <ross`> lol okay i have this problem now
[19:51:30] <ross`> .text is literally puting the text i put in
[19:51:36] <ross`> and not formatting the <input> into into
[19:51:38] <ross`> into html
[19:51:42] <aro> use .html()
[19:51:44] <ross`> k
[19:51:57] * aro washes her spoon
[19:52:22] <doug65536> ross`: that's what text() is for, it properly escapes stuff for you to prevent XSS vulnerabilities and stuff. use it when the text is really text
[19:52:34] <ross`> oh i see
[19:52:37] <ross`> so for like forums and stuff
[19:52:38] <ross`> nice
[19:52:48] <ross`> that makes sense
[19:52:56] <tw2113> generally, the methods that jQuery set up are pretty well named
[19:53:03] <tw2113> for what they do
[19:58:27] <Aric_> Can jQuery selectors find things like [[text]] or is it limited to elements, ids and classes?
[19:59:39] <T13|sleeps> Aric_: what is [[text]]?
[19:59:57] <Aric_> placeholder for something with [['s surrounding it
[20:00:34] <T13|sleeps> I think I know what it is, but would like to be sure?
[20:00:58] <T13|sleeps> You mean Wiki code for an internal link?
[20:01:01] <CWSpear> jQuery itself doesn't have templating, and I don't think you could select something like that
[20:01:10] <CWSpear> but there are a lot of templating engines out there written in JS
[20:01:35] <T13|sleeps> You could find it, but I think it's deeper than that.
[20:01:54] <CWSpear> There was an old jQuery templating plugin, but I think it's not support/around anymore
[20:02:17] <Aric_> i'm just looking for something simple to replicate like wikipedia has with red links for non existing pages? using [[pagename]] i think i can do it in plain js though..
[20:02:34] <CWSpear> you could using regex
[20:02:35] <T13|sleeps> Yeah..
[20:02:55] <CWSpear> or use handlerbars, which normally uses {{test}}, but I think you can set it to use [[]]
[20:03:32] <Aric_> i don't want templates though, handlebars didn't have a proper way to do it so i'll use some regex etc
[20:04:07] <T13|sleeps> The MediaWiki parser turns [[text]] into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/text" title="text">text</a>
[20:04:11] <javalover> help, using a replaceWith() function to change html, but I have to increase the height first,  what's the general rule for increasing height when adding new html objects?
[20:04:34] <javalover> if I don't increase the height it causes a glitch in scrollbar, that's why i'm asking, I wish i could just increase based on known height but I don't know what the height is going to be...
[20:11:43] <javalover> ok this is working but I feel I might be sacraficing .02 miliseconds in load time for it
[20:11:50] <javalover> meh least it works before it was glitching :-)
[20:46:34] <ibiwan> what is the proper jquery/jui way to make a link that displays as a button?  wrapping a <button> in an <a> or <form> tag?  just using onclick to set the window.location?  setting a class on an <a> so that it displays like a button?
[20:46:50] <tw2113> css?
[20:47:58] <ibiwan> what if I want it to look like a specific button, say from a given themeroller theme?  do I have to go copy-paste the css and apply it to my own class?  or is there a more generic way to do it?
[20:48:20] <tw2113> see if there's already a class defined for that button
[20:48:24] <tw2113> re-use as you need
[20:48:53] <ibiwan> so do I use an <a> or a <button> as the base?
[20:49:24] <tw2113> i would assume it depends on how any classes are defined
[20:49:29] <tw2113> if it's a.something
[20:49:32] <tw2113> then an a tag
[20:49:39] <tw2113> if it's button.something, then button
[20:49:43] <tw2113> if it's just .something, either
[20:50:01] <tw2113> this is me mostly guessing as i don't use UI much, but logic and css says that'd be right
[20:50:07] <ibiwan> so there's not a "right" way to use jui, just a bunch of crap in a css file I can mix and match?
[20:50:09] <ibiwan> that doesn't seem right
[20:50:25] <tw2113> check the bloody source
[20:50:52] <ibiwan> I can read source till I'm blue in the face, but I can't find anything telling me the idiomatic way to do it.  and yes, I have been reading the bloody source.
[20:51:06] <tw2113> is it just .something for classes?
[20:51:13] <tw2113> if yes, then it's a pretty flexible thing
[20:51:23] <ibiwan> if you don't know, you can just say so
[20:51:31] <tw2113> if they tack on tags in front of the selectors, then it's a bit more specific
[20:51:56] <tw2113> i'm talking in re-usable class selectors in css
[20:52:06] <ibiwan> *nods*
[20:52:35] <ibiwan> and I'm talking "if someone familiar with jquery-ui looked at my code a year from now, would they know what I was going for without digging into the library source code"
[20:58:10] <ibiwan> here we go... I turn anything into a button by calling "$( ".menubtn" ).button();" on it... so if I give my anchor the menubtn class then call that, it gets buttonized
[20:59:30] <furoido> knock knock
[21:11:00] <ibiwan> who's there?
[21:20:05] <furoido> its possible to load iframe codes right?
[21:38:58] <Pistos> (Can't seem to find this on the web) How can I list all event handlers on a given selector?
[21:45:59] <LoneSoldier728> hey anyone here heard of impress.js?
[22:04:17] <doug65536> Pistos: afaik, you can't
[22:04:33] <Pistos> doug65536: Hmkay.
[22:04:38] <Pistos> Seems you used to be able to.
[22:04:45] <Pistos> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2382994/how-to-check-if-any-javascript-event-listeners-handlers-attached-to-an-element-d
[22:05:02] <Pistos> Kind of odd, to be missing that feature.
[22:05:14] <doug65536> why would anyone want to do that?
[22:05:26] <doug65536> seems like you are fixing symptoms, not problems
[22:06:33] <doug65536> you want random other code to screw with events you setup?
[22:07:06] <doug65536> I totally agree with it not being available
[22:07:17] <doug65536> if you need to keep track, then keep track
[22:07:35] <doug65536> if you need to remove existing ones and replace them, do that
[22:08:27] <doug65536> Pistos: you are asking an XY question. you are doing X and you are asking how to do Y
[22:16:31] <Pistos> doug65536: I just wanted to debug why it seemed like a given handler I was applying seemed to be firing multiple times.
[22:16:55] <Pistos> I ended up fixing that bug anyway, but it would have been good to be able to just call some function in the browser console to confirm that indeed there was more than one handler on a given DOM element.
[22:17:30] <doug65536> Pistos: if you ever have a hard time with that, you can trace calls to $.fn.on and $.fn.off
[22:17:44] <doug65536> all events go through those. on adds handlers, off removes them
[22:18:00] <doug65536> you can even hook them and look at call stacks
[22:18:10] <Pistos> I see.
[22:22:40] <doug65536> Pistos: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8baZ5/1/
[22:22:54] <doug65536> oops, 1sec
[22:23:08] <LoneSoldier728> doug65536
[22:23:13] <LoneSoldier728> have u heard of impress.js
[22:23:27] <doug65536> heard of it yes. don't know anything about it though
[22:23:35] <LoneSoldier728> hm kk
[22:24:25] <doug65536> Pistos: like this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8baZ5/2/
[22:24:54] <doug65536> Pistos: you could extend it to get stack traces, or simply place a breakpoint there and look at call stacks
[22:25:50] <LoneSoldier728> if u are trying to make an image appear when a certain class is active can u just say in css
[22:25:55] <LoneSoldier728> on class active
[22:26:01] <LoneSoldier728> background-image: url;
[22:26:07] <LoneSoldier728> or does it need to happen in js
[22:27:42] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: did you try it?
[22:28:22] <LoneSoldier728> i did but it isnt working for some reason...
[22:28:26] <LoneSoldier728> on the css side
[22:29:12] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/3y7GL/
[22:30:11] <LoneSoldier728> hm ok
[22:30:27] <LoneSoldier728> but the way it is working is that if the current slide is displayed
[22:30:30] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/3y7GL/1/
[22:30:31] <LoneSoldier728> it adds the css class
[22:30:33] <LoneSoldier728> .active
[22:30:48] <doug65536> what?
[22:30:58] <doug65536> I thought you meant active, like css active
[22:31:07] <LoneSoldier728> ya sorry
[22:31:22] <LoneSoldier728> here is the site
[22:31:36] <LoneSoldier728> http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored
[22:32:16] <LoneSoldier728> i want the background for example of that first slide to be an image
[22:32:44] <doug65536> then set a background image in the .active class
[22:33:00] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/3y7GL/1/
[22:33:05] <doug65536> like my div:active
[22:33:21] <LoneSoldier728> hm ok
[22:33:36] <LoneSoldier728> i got it to work on that site too... i got to figure out what is wrong with my thing then
[22:34:38] <doug65536> you clicked the box in my fiddle right?
[22:34:49] <doug65536> sorry I thought that was obvious
[22:36:18] <LoneSoldier728> nvm
[22:36:19] <LoneSoldier728> got it to work
[22:36:22] <LoneSoldier728> thanks a lot tho
[22:36:28] <doug65536> np
[22:36:31] <LoneSoldier728> u kinda made me realize i was doing something wrong
[22:42:24] <daslicht> heya LoneSoldier728
