[05:39:49] <sup3r> hi
[06:35:16] <rumon> I have a site in wordpress.Here I'm using a slider.But slider doesn't working.In browser console  I can see their is a warning undifined is not a function.But slider works well in another theme.I can't find the problem.Can any body help?http://webuildappsllc.com/kymsellers
[06:40:24] <rumon> anybody help!!!
[06:44:33] <decx> you load a new jquery instance after your plugin
[07:54:42] <Mia> how does the element selection work? I have a custom element called <cmd>somethinghere</cmd> and I have a function on document load $("cmd").click ---- however it only works if the elements are already there. The <cmd> elements that are appended to the document later, does not work with the click function
[07:56:14] <Mia> Any ideas are appreciated ^
[07:57:46] <Ansikt> Mia - it binds to that actual dom element.  So if you say, "bind to all <cmd> elements", it will only bind to the ones which exist.
[07:57:54] <Ansikt> Which leaves you with two possibilities:
[07:58:09] <Ansikt> Either rebind to the new elements
[07:58:20] <Mia> hmmm
[07:58:34] <Mia> so I will make a function that makes the "binding" ? is that a heavy operation?
[07:58:36] <Ansikt> or (better) bind a delegated event to a parent element which you know always exists (such as <body>)
[07:58:57] <Mia> Ansikt, oh interesting, can you explain that a little bit further please?
[07:59:20] <Mia> if possible, an example is very much appreciated. I'm still learning js and jquery so, that sounded kind of "out of my league" right now
[07:59:32] <Ansikt> Let's say your DOM looks like this: div.parent --> div.child
[07:59:42] <Ansikt> Actually, let me just write you a fiddle :)
[08:00:27] <shoky> Mia: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[08:02:18] <Mia> Ansikt, shoky thank you very very much
[08:02:37] * Mia is reading more as waits for the fiddle
[08:03:27] <BluDay> Hi, I am looking for a jquery plugin that detects when html elements become visible in the user's viewport. In my case, I'd like to use a css transition on a heading that is a bit down the page and only becomes visible after a certain amount of scrolling.
[08:05:36] <Ansikt> Mia, http://jsfiddle.net/aoawcuqf/
[08:07:23] <Ansikt> BluDay - I've used WowJS and it's nice.  Don't know if it's really what you're looking for.
[08:09:45] <BluDay> Ansikt: looks like something I could use yes. I just bumped into this one myself: https://github.com/morr/jquery.appear
[08:10:29] <BluDay> Will give it a go

[08:15:21] <Bloomberg> yes
[08:15:34] <BluDay> Please clarify, I'm not understanding.
[08:24:56] <Bloomberg> is for automatically deselect something

[09:04:33] <sharax> hi friends

[09:05:02] <sharax> "type" not active on the code
[09:05:12] <Oka> sharax: You forgot to save your fiddle.
[09:05:21] <sharax> sorry

[09:06:40] <shoky> sharax: you're missing a + on line 3
[09:07:05] <sharax> yes but error on the line 2
[09:07:24] <shoky> no, there's a syntax error on line 3
[09:08:57] <jeffreylevesque> how do i check if a value is text
[09:09:08] <jeffreylevesque> 'non-numeric'?
[09:09:33] <jeffreylevesque> i was thinking `isNumeric()`.  But, i don't like that values can be a string representation of a hex value
[09:42:21] <sharax> sorry
[09:42:24] <sharax> http://jsfiddle.net/sharax/y57uro6e/1/
[09:42:34] <sharax> is my code error on the line 4
[09:46:10] <basiclaser_> is there such a thing as $(this).Xpath ? I'd like to save the xpath as a string for an element i click on
[09:49:17] <doug64k> basiclaser_: xpath? what xml document
[09:49:39] <doug64k> basiclaser_: are you saying you have an input field and it has an xpath in it?
[09:50:27] <doug64k> there are libraries that try really hard to make a selector to find a hard-to-find element, but why would you bother, just use a data attribute
[09:51:18] <basiclaser_> doug64k:  sorry for the confusion. I am programming a plugin that, when the user clicks on any element on a webpage, saves data about that element. So i need to grab some sort of absolute css selector or path right?
[09:51:36] <doug64k> basiclaser_: no, you store namespaced data right on the element
[09:51:46] <doug64k> basiclaser_: are you namespacing your things in the plugin?
[09:53:04] <doug64k> here's what namespacing means: say my plugin is called turbofoo. I might attach some event handler in my plugin, so when I attach it, I namespace it, like this: $(selector).on('click.turbofoo change.turbofoo', ...)
[09:53:21] <doug64k> and if I add data, I do $(selector).data('name.turbofoo', value)
[09:53:28] <basiclaser_> i didnt attach a .namespace,
[09:53:45] <doug64k> if you to, it protects you from the user of your plugin wiping your handlers/data
[09:53:51] <doug64k> accidentally wiping*
[09:54:22] <doug64k> and it gives you a clean way for you to clean up just your stuff, like $(selector).off('.turbofoo') *remove only all your own handlers
[09:54:56] <doug64k> and store data in the element with a namespaced name like elem.data('myvarname.turbofoo', value) and read it by not passing the value
[09:55:13] <doug64k> use a codename for your plugin that is unlikely to conflict
[09:55:17] <basiclaser_> doug64k: may i show you a fiddle example?
[09:55:20] <doug64k> sure
[09:55:44] <shoky> think he wants to save the path of the element in the DOM, like send it to the backend
[09:56:03] <basiclaser_> heres what I have so far > http://jsbin.com/lahivacige/1/edit?js
[09:56:19] <doug64k> shoky: a chain of *:nth-child(n) > *:nth-child(n) ? that is the brute force way
[09:56:19] <sharax> please help friends
[09:57:01] <shoky> yeah that would be gross
[09:57:02] <basiclaser_> it lets you visually hide any element when you alt-click it. Id now like to save the hidden elements (all with class .uv-app-invisible) to localstorage, so That i can rehide them on page refresh doug64k
[09:57:25] <shoky> sharax: you didn't give enough code to help you. the code you gave looks ok. we don't know what your "data" parameter is
[09:57:33] <Oka> ^
[09:57:55] <basiclaser_> i might add namespacing if its best practices, but id like to get the storage down first
[09:58:03] <shoky> sharax: and also you didn't say what the problem is
[09:58:07] <doug64k> basiclaser_: you can just store it on the body with a namespace, like $('body').data('globals.mynamespace', plugindata)
[09:58:17] <doug64k> it's page-wide data right?
[09:58:29] <basiclaser_> yes. based on the naked URL
[09:58:38] <sharax> "type" is text parametr
[09:58:51] <basiclaser_> doug64k: so i can store data with namespacing :/ ?
[09:58:52] <doug64k> basiclaser_: the other obvious solution is to just capture it in closure in at the top level of your plugin
[09:59:02] <doug64k> basiclaser_: yes
[09:59:42] <basiclaser_> i was thinking of my browser plugin with just one large JS object, with URL:Xpath selectors to reapply the hidden elements
[10:00:50] <basiclaser_> if you think i should go with namespacing though, maybe it makes more sense. Ill read the jquery docs about it now
[10:00:53] <doug64k> basiclaser_: if you want to "store" an element, just store a reference to the element!
[10:00:58] <doug64k> no need for a "path" to it
[10:01:18] <basiclaser_> but i need to save the elements that were clicked on doug64k
[10:01:43] <shoky> can't save a reference to an element in localStorage
[10:03:19] <basiclaser_> shoky: in any form? thats sounds a bit limiting
[10:03:27] <basiclaser_> im not sure what to do then
[10:03:34] <shoky> hm? you can store any text you want, obviously
[10:04:04] <shoky> just not a live reference, i meant
[10:04:58] <basiclaser_> shoky: ok . right ok cool . so whats a working version of $(this).xpath/css-path ? :P
[10:05:29] <shoky> i donno, i'd avoid having to do any of it in the first place ;p
[10:06:05] <shoky> like.. if you want your plugin to do stuff to some elements, then let the user pass those elements to the plugin, or a selector
[10:06:24] <shoky> or use a predefined class name or whatever
[10:06:55] <shoky> but if you really really need a general solution to get such a path to elements.. i'm sure there are plugins available that'd help
[10:06:58] <basiclaser_> shoky: all the elements i want to store have .uv-app-invisible class
[10:07:28] <shoky> why do you need to store them
[10:07:54] <shoky> just do your thing on elements with that class, then
[10:08:17] <basiclaser_> shoky:  the point of my application is to allow people to mark any element on the page permanently, so between refreshes too
[10:08:23] <sharax> http://jsfiddle.net/sharax/nmau0wtf/1/
[10:08:25] <sharax> please check
[10:08:36] <sharax> @shoky
[10:09:04] <doug64k> basiclaser_: http://www.jstraight.com/1162/1
[10:09:11] <basiclaser_> each element they select is given a class, which marks it. Id like to save the xpath/some ID of all the elements which were marked with the class so I can give them that class again after refresh shoky
[10:09:18] <basiclaser_> doug64k: thanks!
[10:09:19] <shoky> sharax: you're doing  "data.newprice.type"  but your data object just has  .newprice.afshar
[10:11:41] <sharax> mybe "type" =  jessi
[10:12:10] <sharax> or multi use "add" function
[10:13:16] <Velveeta> that sounds like a pretty fragile plugin, re: xpathing to store element paths
[10:13:25] <Paradisee> hello o/
[10:13:26] <shoky> basiclaser_ ok then you can use some function/plugin that gives you such a path. or make it yourself.. don't have a simple solution for you ;p
[10:13:32] <Velveeta> if a site alters the markup in any way, all of those paths are now broken
[10:13:40] <shoky> ^
[10:13:42] <Paradisee> how can i know how many keys are there in a dict ?
[10:14:21] <shoky> Object.keys(myObj).length
[10:14:27] <Paradisee> ty
[10:14:32] <Velveeta> in js, a dict is just called an object.. but to find out how many keys there are, do you mean custom-defined keys, or ones inherited from the prototype also?
[10:15:42] <Paradisee> that code worked for me :D
[10:15:59] * Velveeta golf-claps for shoky, and gives a tip of his hat.
[10:16:46] * shoky curtsies
[10:19:49] <basiclaser_> Velveeta: yeh i hear what you're saying about dynamic xpaths and so on. But how else can I keep taps on different elements?
[10:19:51] <sharax> how to Specify parametr?!
[10:20:38] <basiclaser_> unless shoky 's namespacing solution somehow provides a different method of keeping tabs?
[10:21:16] <shoky> that was doug64k's ;p and it solves a different problem really
[10:21:19] <basiclaser_> shoky: cool code btw :=)
[10:21:25] <basiclaser_> oh my bad
[10:22:01] <Velveeta> i can't think of a reliable way to keep tabs on a selected element across page refreshes with javascript and without ownership of the content
[10:22:12] <sharax> fix problem ;)
[10:22:21] <Velveeta> there are ways, like your xpathing idea, they're just not reliable if you're not the publisher
[10:22:24] <doug64k> basiclaser_: what is
[10:22:25] <sharax>         var taba = data.newprice.type; to         var taba = data.newprice[type];
[10:23:49] <doug64k> basiclaser_: you said plugin, so I took your word for it. plugin data, event handlers, etc, should be namespaced.
[10:24:02] <basiclaser_> doug64k: sorry i dont know what youre referring to .. but thanks for the namespacing code,
[10:24:02] <doug64k> if it is just a normal page then no namespace is recommended
[10:24:17] <basiclaser_> oh ok i see, I'll get right on it
[10:24:20] <doug64k> basiclaser_: what? the namespace is an irrelevant part of that code
[10:24:55] <doug64k> basiclaser_: http://www.jstraight.com/1162/2
[10:25:06] <doug64k> it just stores the data in closure in the ready handler
[10:25:11] <doug64k> remembered
[10:25:19] <doug64k> no jquery tricks
[10:26:39] <basiclaser_> umm i think that was a few steps ahead of me
[10:27:02] <basiclaser_> closure is something to do with plugins? or ?
[10:27:35] <doug64k> basiclaser_: no, javascript scope. since a reference to the event handler is stored, it keeps alive all of the variables that are reachable and referenced from that callback
[10:28:30] <doug64k> that is called a closure. when it captures the scope chain and creates a function object
[10:29:32] <doug64k> because "remembered" is referenced from code that is reachable from a function, it stays in existence as long as any handler that refers to it stil exists
[10:29:47] <doug64k> from a callback function*
[10:30:19] <basiclaser_> i gotcha cool. Does this have any advantages over just throwing xpaths in local storage? :P
[10:30:43] <doug64k> why would you use localstorage? does it have to be preserved across reboots?
[10:31:14] <basiclaser_> doug64k: across multiple reboots yeh
[10:31:31] <doug64k> are you sure the page won't be different tomorrow?
[10:31:40] <basiclaser_> for people who want to permanently modify pages
[10:32:03] <basiclaser_> no, but people can always quickly correct the notations the make on elements
[10:32:04] <doug64k> you are asking an XY question pretty much. your solution is storing xpaths obviously
[10:32:29] <doug64k> but what does storing xpaths solve
[10:33:40] <basiclaser_> person goes to website > changes some elements' CSS > my code saves references to those elements, to reapply the changes the next time the page is loaded.
[10:33:44] <doug64k> a normal app deals with this by referring to things with some sort of id, and remembering the associated id on any element that needs to be tied back to it
[10:34:18] <basiclaser_> I'm not aware of any other ways to do such a thing :(
[10:34:27] <doug64k> a basic example is storing an id of a row on the row element with data-recordid or something
[10:34:28] <basiclaser_> var ohlookanID = xpath :D
[10:35:12] <basiclaser_> doug64k: i see what you mean
[10:36:17] <doug64k> the only solution I can think of is to store a bunch of relevant details about an element and try to do a fuzzy match to find it. good luck with that. solve X, not Y
[10:36:50] <basiclaser_> doug64k: could you please elaborate on what you mean by X and not Y ?
[10:37:12] <basiclaser_> but i get you, xpath + some other attribute to cross-reference
[10:38:37] <doug64k> XY question is when you have problem X, and you think, if only I could get Y to work, then I can solve the X problem. so you go ask people to help with Y (your solution) when you really should ask for help with X (the actual thing to solve)
[10:39:11] <basiclaser_> oh i see, nice
[10:39:32] <shoky> basiclaser_: what exactly are the changes you're making to elements? how does a user use your "plugin" ? why would he?
[10:40:44] <basiclaser_> shoky: they push shift-click to toggle elements between visible/invisible. It's for anybody that would like to hide elements on webpages they use. I use it for distracting elements on pages :)
[10:41:10] <shoky> on webpages they use?  so it's not for the webdeveloper to put on their site? it's for users of a webpage to put.. where?
[10:41:17] <shoky> how does a user install your plugin
[10:42:56] <doug64k> basiclaser_: it sounds like you want to write a browser extension
[10:43:20] <doug64k> adblock plus has a thing to block elements. perhaps they document that somewhere
[10:43:28] <doug64k> their algorithm
[10:43:40] <shoky> they use a selector
[10:44:15] <shoky> when you block an element they choose a selector for you(allowing you to change it) ,  usually it gives you  #id or .class
[10:44:38] <doug64k> ah nice
[10:45:01] <basiclaser_> its going to be distributed as a browser plugin, for the purpose of end-users to be able to choose to hide any element on any website
[10:45:03] <basiclaser_> shoky: did that make sense ? :)
[10:45:03] <doug64k> arms race will cause them to randomize the class and id and stuff :D
[10:45:05] <shoky> but ya maybe they give more generic paths too, haven't tried
[10:45:30] <basiclaser_> I already use it, but would just like to add persistence between refresh/reboot
[10:45:32] <basiclaser_> shoky: hey everybody im sorry for being so vague so far. Here's a working example
[10:45:32] <basiclaser_> please try it by shift-clicking on the boxes http://jsbin.com/lahivacige/1/edit?html,css,output
[10:45:56] <shoky> basiclaser_: it makes sense yes. but you could've said so from the beginning instead of saying it's a jquery plugin. that'd be a big part of the X ;)
[10:46:23] <basiclaser_> doug64k: thats right its wrapped in a chrome plugin right now
[10:47:12] <basiclaser_> ok cool ill look into it
[10:49:21] <basiclaser_> That would be a great solution if all the elements on every website use and ID, But i can't use .class because that would give false positives
[10:51:19] <basiclaser_> oh sorry for the confusion, i never meant for it to sound like that
[10:51:48] <doug64k> basiclaser_: it has been done before. all you need to do is walk up the dom and remember various things about each step up, then iteratively remove parts of the selector and see if they might be optional, then when attempting to use the selector, try removing various combinations of optional components until you find one that finds 1 element
[10:51:56] <doug64k> but good luck with that testing nightmare
[10:52:18] <basiclaser_> doug64k: ah! like a perspective fingerprint? :)
[10:53:39] <basiclaser_> yeh that does sound like hell.
[10:55:07] <shoky> here's what adblockplus does:  https://github.com/adblockplus/adblockpluschrome/blob/master/include.postload.js#L394
[10:55:44] <shoky> seems it looks for id, classes, "src" attributes, and "style" attributes as last resort..
[11:20:39] <basiclaser_> Ill post the browser plugin in here, when I've wrapped it up this evening
[13:38:33] <inspiron> I'd like to use the scrollTop in jQuery, but that's the only feature I need to use and I don't want to include all of jquery for my responsive website because i want to lower libraries being downloaded. any ideas?
[13:41:16] <shoky> inspiron: it just uses window.scrollTo if you're setting it on window, and does elem.scrollTop = value;   for any other element
[13:44:02] <shoky> and for getting the current value, it's window.pageYOffset or elem.scrollTop
[13:44:06] <inspiron> how would i animate a scroll to #here
[13:44:15] <inspiron> or just top of page
[13:44:18] <shoky> animate?  you said you only wanted .scrollTop()
[13:44:29] <inspiron> sorry, i'd like it to animate too
[13:44:34] <shoky> uh
[13:44:53] <shoky> just include jquery :\
[13:44:57] <inspiron> heh :)
[13:45:02] <inspiron> maybe zepto?
[13:45:09] <shoky> jquery is small enough
[13:46:53] <shoky> but you can use css transitions
[13:47:24] <shoky> oh hm donno if those can scroll the window
[13:48:08] <dipser> scrolling with css? how.
[13:50:22] <shoky> yea i wasn't thinking of scrolling then
[14:01:57] <inspiron> thanks, i'm going with jquery. that was a good suggestion

[15:31:35] <dan_j> Hi. If i've got a group of checkboxes, all with the same name but different values, how can i select a specific checkbox?
[15:35:21] <j_wright> why would they have the same name?
[15:37:47] <j_wright> dan_j: select it by its id?
[15:40:10] <yurakeshi> dan_j, select by they value... $('input:checkbox[value=1]')
[15:47:28] <dunpeal> Is there a shortcut for binding the same function to two events?
[15:53:32] <systemfault> No, just store the function in a variable and use that variable when declaring the two events.
[15:55:08] <dunpeal> systemfault: thanks!

[17:41:39] <hajiang_> Oh cool
[17:41:52] <hajiang_> So I've used jquery quite a bit in different web applications
[17:42:04] <hajiang_> and I was looking to learn more about how jquery works
[17:42:23] <hajiang_> so I looked at the github for jquery
[17:42:32] <hajiang_> and I'm not really sure where to start
[17:42:45] <hajiang_> so I was wondering if anyone had any tips or pointers to a good place to start
[17:42:59] <hajiang_> or somewhere I could read a brief overview of the code
[17:43:03] <hajiang_> or the project structure

[22:24:13] <crocket> An event callback at https://github.com/crocket/socket-chat-example/blob/master/index.html#L20-L25 is never invoked when I submit a form.
[22:24:17] <crocket> Can anybody diagnose the problem?
[22:24:26] <crocket> https://github.com/crocket/socket-chat-example is very easy to run.
[22:27:29] <doug64k> crocket: because the elements dont exist yet. before line 19 add: jQuery(function($) {    and after line 26 add });
[22:27:44] <crocket> doug64k, How can I solve the problem?
[22:27:57] <doug64k> what I just said solves it
[22:28:10] <doug64k> that will defer that code until the elements all exist
[22:28:15] <doug64k> then it can work
[22:28:23] <crocket> doug64k, Where can I find the documentation ?
[22:28:36] <doug64k> crocket: google jquery document ready
[22:29:25] <crocket> doug64k, I see http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[22:29:29] <crocket> It's something different.
[22:29:33] <doug64k> crocket: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[22:33:39] <crocket> doug64k, Thanks for info
