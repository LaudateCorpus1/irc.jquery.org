[11:22:29] <SdxaDev> Hello, Guys! I'm trying to add an ID to all elements that contains a specific class, However isn't working.
[11:23:53] <SdxaDev> here is the code: https://ghostbin.com/paste/8ouet
[11:32:10] <indigoblue> which are the lines that pertain to adding the ID
[11:32:26] <indigoblue> 58-52?
[11:32:29] <indigoblue> err
[11:32:32] <indigoblue> 50-52?*
[14:39:52] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:42:51] <Azrael_-> i'm just starting with npm+jquery. i have installed the jquery-package and i have it now in the subfolder "node_modules". how should i include it best into my page? just copy the files of the dist-folder and reference jquery.min.js or use a different approach?
[14:44:14] <indigoblue> yeah, you can do it that way
[14:44:20] <indigoblue> or you can link to a cdn distributed copy of jquery
[14:44:24] <indigoblue> that's what I do
[14:44:43] <indigoblue> either way, it's not a huge deal b/c the jquery filesize is quite low. something around 32kb, i think
[14:46:21] <Azrael_-> i'm also a little bit confused. i also want to use bootstrap. according to the documents it needs jquery, and when testing, it works. but if i try to use jquery-commands right fromt he start, i get an error. if i run them later manually, they properly work. am i mixing up things?
[14:46:55] <Azrael_-> explanation: i tried only referencing bootstrap using this guide here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/ without explicitly referencing jquery
[14:47:13] <indigoblue> bootstrap uses jquery for some if its functions
[14:47:28] <indigoblue> if bootstrap loads before jquery, some of the functionality won't work
[14:51:32] <Azrael_-> quite confusing if it works after the site has completely loaded
[14:52:19] <indigoblue> it, you mean bootstrap?
[14:53:43] <indigoblue> I think load order goes something like jquery -> bootstrap -> page. I'm not too experienced about this so I might be technicallly wrong, but that's what it appears to be.
[14:54:40] <indigoblue> there's also a second possibility that it goes page -> jquery -> bootstrap.
[14:55:03] <indigoblue> the page should still appear correctly because the .css files for bootstrap are what is responsible for the look of the page.
[14:55:47] <indigoblue> the javascript bootstrap library is what provides the functionality (such as collapsing menu's or any associated javascript functions that are called). The css file is responsible for the look of the page
[14:56:29] <indigoblue> maybe someone who is more experienced can chime in
[14:57:09] <indigoblue> but that is pretty doubtful... been here for three days and without your exception, I haven't seen or heard a fucking peep.
[14:59:18] <Azrael_-> ok, thanks
[15:00:13] <Azrael_-> been here a few months ago (or even longer) a little bit, and when asking i got some help. no idea what happened
[15:00:36] <Azrael_-> i only come here if i again miserably fail at basic tasks with jquery/javascript
[15:01:12] <indigoblue> yeah, always best to be as self reliant as possible
[15:01:49] <indigoblue> but also doesn't hurt to ask for help
[15:02:17] <Azrael_-> also, most of the time: either the task is too basic and it is ridiculous to ask somebody for help (although difficult for yourself), or it gets too specific and most of the time nobody wants to invest the time to even understand your question
[15:02:35] <indigoblue> let me know if you get your bootstrap stuff figured out. I started on it a few days earlier but found that it was easier to build my site using css3 instead of bootstrap. I didn't like the bootstrap look b/c it was too generic and I didn't really want to fiddle with sass.
[15:03:31] <indigoblue> yeah, I hear you there.
[15:03:35] <indigoblue> the struggle is real
[15:04:18] <Azrael_-> the setup itself seems to work. normally i just prettify some tables with bootstrap, not use it for the whole page. i hate frontend-work, so it looks way better than plain <table> :)
[15:07:16] <Azrael_-> also just realized, the bootstrap-channel at ##bootstrap  always tried just "#bootstrap" which fails
[15:07:36] <Azrael_-> so lets help each other on jquery if everybody else in here is dead
[15:07:44] <indigoblue> sure, I'm down
[15:09:04] <indigoblue> I'll be in this channel for the next 3 weeks. That's how long I anticipate my project to last.
[15:09:33] <Azrael_-> hehe, good luck
[21:44:55] <Nirvash> Any thoughts on why a dropdown .change() would cause noticeable lag before the script continues? Example: Click dropdown, select "1".  $('#dropdown').change(function() { $('#form').submit(); });
[21:44:55] <Nirvash> The dropdown continues to be shown for about a second before the page reloads
[22:00:08] <pavonia> Are you testing on a local server? Otherwise it sounds like the normal network lag
[22:07:16] <Nirvash> It's on a remote server â€” I just found it odd that it wouldn't close the dropdown, THEN complete the submit.
[22:07:33] <Nirvash> I even tried using .blur() but the dropdown stays open the entire time
[22:07:46] <Nirvash> Until finally the page is loaded and the results appear
