[00:00:01] <Cork> the tool you need to do this is in jquery, but if you don't want to use them feel free not to
[00:00:16] <Felishia> am I blaming something?... because I think that's a jquery plugin...
[00:00:59] <cyberbrai> Cork  upload the pdf to a server yup i have to do that but not in xml with binary data
[00:01:11] <cyberbrai> cork http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6978156/get-base64-encode-file-data-from-input-form
[00:01:49] <Felishia> I was just trying to show something interesting if someone had or will have the same issue and didn't want to start getting crazy trying to find a solution because the boss and the deadlines doesn't always allow you to be create and find complicated solutions
[00:02:24] <Cork> Felishia: sure link it if you like, but don't make false statement that you have to rewrite jquery to do it
[00:02:40] <Cork> deferred can do this just fine
[00:02:55] <Felishia> okaaay, but that would be some insane lines of code.
[00:02:56] <hd1> Cork, am getting "Access to restricted URI denied" what gives?
[00:03:31] <Cork> hd1: if you're trying to fetch the html of the link target with ajax, the browser will block you
[00:04:11] <Cork> hd1: as you can't do cross domain ajax calls safely unless the server the request goes to is explicitly allowing it
[00:05:10] <hd1> that's exactly what I'm trying to do :(
[00:05:30] <cyberbrai> Cork the link i send i think you see it i have to do something like that
[00:05:37] <Cork> hd1: only way to do it is to have a server do the request and your client make the request to proxy server
[00:05:38] <hd1> I'd like to replace the url with the title of the document linked to... is this possible?
[00:05:52] <Cork> *to the proxy server
[00:06:03] <danielguillamot_> Cork: my ajax function is actually uploading a file... 10mb to 50mb to the server
[00:06:06] <Cork> hd1: no it isn't possible to do this directly from js
[00:06:06] <Uhkis> hd1: no, unless you have something else than js to fetch the title for you
[00:06:21] <danielguillamot_> Cork: during the upload, the animation of the animated.gif freezes. is there a way around this? must i chunk up the upload?
[00:06:45] <Cork> danielguillamot_: sure, like i said it shouldn't block if the ajax call is async
[00:06:56] <Cork> unless disk io is the cause of your hang
[00:07:03] <Cork> and then there isn't much you can do about it
[00:07:21] <Uhkis> plot twist: gif has loop count instead of endless
[00:07:40] <cyberbrai> CORK dude help on it plz
[00:07:59] <Cork> cyberbrai: i have told you what you can do
[00:08:03] <danielguillamot_> Cork: interesting, firefox doesnt pause, but Canary does.. let me try default chrome then and see
[00:08:07] <Cork> can't help you with a third option
[00:08:48] <cyberbrai> Cork ok just tel me how can i use the base 64 encode decode i can do my self help on it plz
[00:08:57] <Cork> heh
[00:09:00] <Cork> your funny
[00:09:29] <Cork> like i said there isn't a third option, so asking again and again for a third option is... pointless
[00:09:57] <Uhkis> how was insanity defined again? ;)
[00:11:15] <cyberbrai> Cork ok thanks for help
[00:12:07] <cyberbrai> Uhkis i don't think that was my insanity i just want to know
[00:13:18] <Uhkis> :-)
[00:17:29] <spillere> i wanna do in a way that if region or producer is visible, it will hide the other one before showing it up http://jsfiddle.net/fuzkhLn4/2/
[00:18:43] <Cork> spillere: do you have an element wrapping all of this?
[00:18:50] <Cork> cause that would simplify things a lot
[00:19:17] <spillere> its inside an <article
[00:22:55] <Cork> spillere: like so? http://jsfiddle.net/fuzkhLn4/3/
[00:24:05] <spillere> Cork: should use a toggle. because I may want both to be hidden.
[00:24:12] <spillere> So both can be hidden, but only one can be show
[00:24:15] <spillere> does it make sense?
[00:25:24] <Cork> like this then http://jsfiddle.net/fuzkhLn4/4/
[00:26:08] <Cork> spillere: btw, please don't abuse <a> tags
[00:26:20] <Cork> it should only be used for links, use <button> for "actions"
[00:26:42] <spillere> i know, but its just a quick example, could be a "p"
[00:26:53] <Cork> could be <button> ;P
[00:27:26] <spillere> yeah
[00:27:56] <danielguillamot_> i think i will need a web worker to do this file upload while keeping gif animaton
[00:33:45] <spillere> Cork: will this script if there is another parent on the way of the burrons?
[00:34:05] <Cork> will this script what?
[00:35:07] <Cork> spillere: the script expects the closest article parent to isolate the groups
[00:35:18] <Cork> if that is what you mean
[00:35:45] <Cork> hmm it does have a problem though
[00:36:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/fuzkhLn4/6/
[00:37:16] <spillere> Cork: the actual layout http://jsfiddle.net/fuzkhLn4/7/ (cleaned from content)
[00:37:30] <spillere> im trying to convert it to this scheme
[00:37:43] <Cork> spillere: wrong name in the data-target
[00:38:08] <Cork> should work except for that
[00:38:28] <spillere> boom!
[00:38:30] <Cork> spillere: the data-target should be the class name
[00:38:31] <spillere> thanks!
[00:38:43] <spillere> you are tha man!
[00:53:35] <ir7466> hi
[01:32:14] <Omar-> good morning!
[01:42:56] <lilsammy> uhhhhh got this weird issue, im building a system using bootstrap and a few (understatement) jquery plugins, and I think because I am using jquery ui and fuelux its confusing things and making my date pickers not work because the function call is the same
[01:43:02] <lilsammy> anyone had this issue before?
[01:45:40] <nikhil_> i have these two inline scripts on a page: https://dpaste.de/CN3K. The html they operate on is here: https://dpaste.de/UQTQ | The problem is, the click() event is firing only if the page is brand new (refreshed), and then too only once. It will not fire again, and it will not fire at all if the add inline script below it is used before the click event occurs. Why?
[01:52:42] <Omar-> nikhil_ the elements are dynamically addeD?
[01:52:50] <Omar-> if yes, you need to "Delegate" the event
[01:54:07] <Omar-> $(document).on("click", '.itemDelete', function
[01:54:36] <Cork> preferably find a static parent instead of document though
[01:54:48] <Omar-> Cork yup
[01:56:57] <user_corrupt> I'm doing a $.post in order to send some data to a PHP script to submit to database (on click), and I had been doing a window.location = redirect at that point as well, but for some reason that is screwing up the $.post in Safariâ€¦ any suggestions?
[01:57:08] <nikhil_> thanks guys, closest static parent you mean an elt that is not going to change at all (Cork, Omar)
[01:57:51] <Omar-> nikhil_ the static parent of .itemDelete. An element that you dont add dynamically
[01:57:56] <Omar-> you have it hard coded
[01:57:58] <Cork> nikhil_: an element that exist on page load, and isn't replaced
[01:58:07] <nikhil_> thanks
[02:16:59] <Xatenev> filters.each(function (index) {
[02:17:00] <Xatenev>    $(filters[index]).on('change', showFilterInListEvent);
[02:17:00] <Xatenev> });
[02:17:01] <Xatenev> what is wrong here? .\
[02:17:18] <Xatenev> simple code but its not working^^ i wrote console.log("test") into the evnet
[02:17:19] <Xatenev> but its not displaying
[02:17:27] <Xatenev> its definetly iterating
[02:17:35] <Cork> Xatenev: you don't need the each
[02:17:47] <Xatenev> how then?
[02:17:50] <Cork> just do filters.on('change', showFilterInListEvent);
[02:18:00] <Xatenev> then it applies the event ofr lal?
[02:18:02] <Xatenev> for all?
[02:18:06] <Cork> yes
[02:18:12] <Xatenev> LOLLOO
[02:18:13] <Xatenev> thank u
[02:18:20] * Xatenev deletes 20 useless lines or smth
[02:19:05] <Xatenev> lol works great now
[02:19:06] <Xatenev> thanks
[02:19:07] <Cork> also about .each "this" inside it is the element of the iteration
[02:19:20] <Cork> so $(filters[index]) would have been $(this)
[02:19:25] <Xatenev> oh okay
[02:19:28] <Xatenev> tank u
[02:19:43] <Xatenev> works perfect now^^ and deleted like 40 lines of useless code all over the project
[02:28:26] <Uhkis> :-)
[02:45:03] <lilsammy> nikhil_ lol our dell account manager is called nikhil
[02:53:52] <nikhil_> lilsammy, cool? :)
[02:56:32] <lilsammy> Yeah sell me some PC's Nikhil
[03:06:09] <Kartagis> http://html.webcinizim.com/yayinevi/www <--- why would I get Mustache not defined here?
[03:07:15] <Cork> Kartagis: img and input is are self closing elements, there is no </img> or </input>
[03:07:46] <Cork> Kartagis: about mustache your trying to use it before you load it
[03:07:53] <Cork> (you load index before mustache)
[03:08:59] <Kartagis> oh
[03:09:35] <Kartagis> thanks
[03:25:11] <Otterpocket> Hello, I am trying to make a function that checks and unchecks all checkboxes with a button using toggle() but instead of running one of the 2 function it is toggling the visibility of the checkboxes http://pastebin.com/jYv0rGgS
[03:25:30] <Otterpocket> What am I doing wrong?
[03:26:25] <Koopz> ...this is jquery?
[03:26:52] <Otterpocket> Koopz, Well coffeescript but jquery, yea
[03:27:23] <Koopz> i've never seen those "->" in javascript... k... well .toggle() does exactly what you said
[03:27:52] <Koopz> it toggles the visibility of anything you're toggling
[03:28:36] <Otterpocket> I thought it was this https://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/ ?
[03:28:55] <Cork> Otterpocket: "version deprecated: 1.8, removed: 1.9"
[03:29:12] <Cork> so unless you're on a really old version of jquery that event doesn't exist any more
[03:29:16] <Otterpocket> Cork, ahhh :D
[03:29:31] <Cork> so you get https://api.jquery.com/toggle/ instead
[03:29:40] <Otterpocket> Cork, ok
[03:30:02] <Otterpocket> Cork, Is there anything I can use instead?
[03:30:14] <Otterpocket> Or do I just have to use my own conditional logic?
[03:30:17] <Cork> Otterpocket: store the toggle state in data('state')
[03:30:19] <Koopz> you could .trigger() the element
[03:30:35] <Cork> and just do .prop('checked', $(this).data('state'))
[03:30:59] <Otterpocket> Cork, awesome thanks
[03:31:33] <Cork> alternatively you could do something a bit more fancy and check for what is the most common state :)
[03:31:47] <Cork> (of the checkboxes) and pick that or the oposite state
[03:40:30] <d3m0n> Is it possible to chain like this: $('#preview').contents().find('#title').text(title).find('#subtitle').text(subtitle).find('#message').html(message);
[03:42:57] <Cork> d3m0n: yes, though as ids are unique it is pointless
[03:43:05] <Cork> so you can just as well use $() there
[03:43:41] <d3m0n> Ahh, as in just $('#id')text(var); ?
[03:43:49] <Cork> with the dot ya
[03:44:11] <d3m0n> As is, it doesn't work. It only changes the first find()
[03:44:39] <Cork> d3m0n: an id can only match one id
[03:44:46] <Cork> uh, one element
[03:44:55] <Cork> id is an unique identification for a single element
[03:45:05] <Cork> if you want to target multiple elements use classes
[03:45:13] <d3m0n> Correct, but I am trying to go through #previews contents and change the values of those ID's
[03:45:55] <Cork> d3m0n: $('#title').text(title); $('#subtitle').text(subtitle); $('#message').html(message)
[03:46:09] <d3m0n> I need the $('#preview').contents()
[03:46:09] <Cork> d3m0n: if you have more then one of those elements, you want a class
[03:46:20] <d3m0n> Because I am editing an iframe
[03:46:21] <Cork> its inside an iframe?
[03:46:23] <Cork> ah
[03:46:24] <d3m0n> COrrect
[03:46:50] <Cork> then do doc = $('#preview').contents(); doc.find(); doc.find()
[03:47:01] <d3m0n> Ok thats what I figured I would be doing
[03:47:08] <Cork> as long as the element isn't directly inside body that will work
[03:47:10] <d3m0n> Just thought I could possibly chain like above
[03:47:31] <Cork> d3m0n: it works if the other elements are always inside the former
[03:47:40] <d3m0n> Ahh ok, gotcha.
[03:47:42] <Cork> but then you would remove them when you call .text()
[03:47:49] <d3m0n> Thanks Cork
[04:33:14] <havardge> I'm PUT-ting json data to my web server using ajax. I think my setup is correct, because when i set data to "{}" the PUT is received by the server. However, when I set data to JSON.stringify(usefuldata), I get a 400 bad request, and the server is not invoked at all.
[04:34:20] <havardge> Is there some gotcha when using JSON.stringify?
[04:43:32] <xec> havardge: try sending the object as is (jquery will stringify for you)
[04:46:07] <Uhkis> is there some convenient way to get all option values from a select or do i have to loop it myself?
[04:46:37] <havardge> xec: I don't think it stringifies it automatically when doing POST or PUT
[04:47:39] <xec> havardge: try it and see. I think it does. With GET it serializes to querystring (which is different from stringify)
[04:48:35] <xec> it might depend on what dataType you use
[04:49:46] <havardge> I'm using dataType: 'json'
[04:51:21] <xec> actually, the dataType is probably just for the response, i.e. what format you expect to get back from the server
[04:53:20] <xec> i usually just do $.post(url, dataObject) and it's fine
[04:55:02] <xec> if your server requires the headers to receive json, you might need to do it the hard way: $.ajax({ url: url, type: "POST", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", data: JSON.stringify(dataObject) })
[05:01:52] <havardge> xec: I have set all those things as well. I think I figured out what the error is. The server fails to convert one of the fields from js -> java. But it did so without logging any error
[05:03:52] <havardge> So, now it has become a java problem instead. xec: thanks anyway for your assistance :) :)
[05:04:29] <xec> havardge: i did some more reading by the way, and i was wrong about jquery converting objects to json. it converts to querystring by default
[05:04:48] <xec> which is what your server probably expects
[05:06:39] <xec> sorry about the confusion.
[05:07:14] <havardge> xec: yeah, I also needed the headers for it to work. My ajax call is now a beast :/
[05:39:01] <tirengarfio> Follow the next steps here: http://jsfiddle.net/tirengarfio/LvsYc/5599/ Step 1: click on the Ziiweb image, you will generate a coordinate. Step 2: open an image using the Browse button, and click on it. As you can see the coordinate of the first image is ketp, why since I have this line "points = []; " is being executed after uploading the image?
[05:41:15] <tocka> hi guys
[05:41:33] <tocka> im getting the height of the iframe contents inside
[05:41:33] <Cork> tirengarfio: you only do points = []; on init
[05:41:42] <Cork> you prob want to run it in one of the events
[05:41:46] <tocka> with an onLoad function
[05:41:47] <tocka> $( "#iframe" ).on('load', function() {
[05:41:56] <tocka> but when I set the height to a variable
[05:42:09] <tocka> the variable is empty if I try to use it
[05:42:19] <tocka> outside the onload function
[05:42:30] <tocka> is there a way to bypass this?
[05:42:33] <Cork> tocka: .on is event handlers, they are called async
[05:42:48] <Cork> so if you try to use the value outside the load event it will try to use it before the value is set
[05:42:50] <tocka> Ok, going to read up on that
[05:45:20] <Kartagis> Cork: have you got a decent guide for me to read regarding searching remotely?
[05:45:39] <Cork> Kartagis: uh, you can't search remotely
[05:45:45] <Cork> i've told you this several times
[05:46:04] <Cork> you can send a request to a remote service and IT does the search locally
[05:46:24] <Kartagis> did you? no I'm not joking, I must have missed it
[05:46:25] <Cork> if there is no such service you can't do a remote search and you have to fetch it and search locally
[05:46:47] <Cork> Kartagis: uh we had this discussion yesterday and a again last week
[05:47:09] <Kartagis> Cork: anyway, how can I send a request to a remote service?
[05:47:20] <Cork> ajax
[05:47:52] <Kartagis> I know it should be done with ajax, but any guides I can read?
[05:48:11] <Cork> O_o
[05:48:24] <Cork> no, you use ajax can give it the url
[05:48:30] <Cork> what is there to write a guide for?
[05:49:41] <Cork> $.ajax('url/to/the/script/doing/the/search' { data: { parameters: 'for the script' } }).done(function(data) { /* response */ });
[05:49:44] <Cork> that's it
[05:51:00] <Kartagis> Cork: parameters will be from a textfield
[05:51:26] <Kartagis> Cork: url will be full url with fqdn and all?
[05:52:41] <Cork> Kartagis: url is an url, it can be any url you area allowed to access, just like any other url
[05:52:53] <Cork> the parameters depends on what the server script requires
[05:53:33] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/165712/ like this?
[05:53:47] <Cork> uh... no
[05:53:59] <Cork> / isn't allowed in parameters
[05:54:16] <Cork> Kartagis: you can't just make up parameters you have to check what the server requires
[05:55:28] <Kartagis> Cork: http://paste.debian.net/165713/ maybe?
[05:55:39] <Cork> ... how would i know?
[05:55:48] <Cork> i don't know what you're server requires
[05:55:48] <Kartagis> Cork: the server requires that syntax
[05:55:57] <Cork> *your
[05:57:11] <Kartagis> uhm, I spoke too soon
[05:57:40] <Kartagis> that  produced http://yayinevi.sabanciuniv.edu/search/node?search=node%2Ffelsefi
[05:57:58] <Cork> ya, that is what params look like
[06:00:43] <Kartagis> uhm
[06:05:12] <Kartagis> I got the right syntax, but / are encoded to %2F
[06:05:25] <Kartagis> what can I do about that?
[06:05:26] <Cork> Kartagis: that is expected
[06:05:41] <Cork> the server should be expecting the params to be url encoded
[06:06:11] <Kartagis> anything I can do client-side?
[06:06:32] <Cork> uh, do what?
[06:06:38] <Cork> if you remove that you will have an invalid url
[06:07:02] <Cork> it is by spec supposed to do that
[06:07:26] <Kartagis> the server requires http://yayinevi.sabanciuniv.edu/?q=search/node/felsefi syntax
[06:07:54] <Cork> lovely, well that is an invalid url
[06:08:15] <Kartagis> nothing I can do?
[06:08:27] <Cork> the only option is to concat the url your self so you can generate what ever you need
[06:08:42] <Cork> though be careful cause that url can mess up proxies
[06:09:12] <standaniels> Guys, I need help: http://jsfiddle.net/wdbkxw1z/
[06:09:39] <standaniels> When you click on a date the date of the field supposed to get echoed, but instead the date echoed is always the last date on the calendar
[06:11:12] <Cork> standaniels: you share one date variable with all the elements
[06:11:18] <Cork> so ya, you only have the last date
[06:11:29] <Cork> as it will overwrite the other ones
[06:11:59] <standaniels> Cork: I figured. How can I solve it?
[06:12:03] <Cork> standaniels: simplest is to store the date in a cell.data('date')
[06:12:27] <Cork> standaniels: and when you're at it remove the on event from each element and bind it on #target (at the end) instead
[06:12:34] <Cork> and delegate it to the td from there
[06:13:00] <samssh> Cork, I'm pretty sure you can have slashes in the query part of a URL.
[06:13:05] <Cork> .on('click', 'td', function() { options.onDateClick($(this).data('date')); });
[06:13:25] <standaniels> Okay thanks Cork! Can I ask why I should bind it on #target instead?
[06:13:35] <Cork> samssh: as the values is meant to be url encoded sure, you can, but they are expected to be encoded
[06:13:59] <Cork> standaniels: cause currently you bind one event handler for each td, when you can do it with one instead
[06:14:05] <Cork> it speed things up
[06:14:16] <Cork> standaniels: also you don't want to append to the dom in a loop
[06:14:25] <Cork> collect the elements in an array and append them all in on go
[06:14:31] <Cork> it makes a big difference in performance
[06:14:53] <Cork> actually, scratch the last part
[06:14:56] <samssh> Cork, Un-encoded, they don't conflict with anything but bad parsers, and aren't disallowed in the query string though..
[06:14:59] <Cork> you create a fragment so it is fine
[06:17:27] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/165719/ please tell me this works
[06:18:47] <samssh> Cork, Yeah, RFC 3986 even specifically mentions using slash unencoded in the query string. (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt section 3.4)
[06:18:52] <Xatenev> Kartagis: ?
[06:20:05] <standaniels> Cork: Ah yes, if you store the date in cell.data() you're right ðŸ˜Š Thanks!
[06:20:15] <Cork> Kartagis: you can't use data: as it will encode what you give it
[06:20:45] <Cork> Kartagis: or rather you can't give it an object you have to build a string and give it that
[06:21:36] <tirengarfio> I have modified my code my code a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/tirengarfio/LvsYc/5600/ but still get the problem I said before. You told me to run "points = []" out of init(), but I need it inside "init()" since "init()" is called each time I preview an image.
[06:22:46] <Cork> tirengarfio: you don't reset the points at all now
[06:22:51] <Cork> when is it you want to reset it?
[06:23:03] <Cork> oh, sorry read wrong
[06:23:18] <cyberbrai> Cork :  http://jsfiddle.net/Xadvz/235/   base64
[06:23:21] <tirengarfio> after clicking Browse and open an image
[06:24:24] <Cork> hmm
[06:24:44] <Cork> tirengarfio: that is called when canvasAreaDraw is called so it should reset
[06:26:27] <tirengarfio> but it doesn't reset, so where is the problem?
[06:27:14] <Kartagis> so, what should I use?
[06:27:52] <Cork> tirengarfio: you never remove the code for the old image
[06:28:02] <Cork> so you basically run two versions at the same time
[06:28:17] <Cork> you can't just call canvasAreaDraw when you change the image
[06:28:34] <Cork> you need to tell it to reset as the plugin is already active on the canvas
[06:41:42] <tirengarfio> Cork, should I reset the plugin before it is activated again? Im a bit lost
[06:42:10] <Cork> tirengarfio: you would have to implement a method to give it a new image and to reset the variables that need to be reset
[06:42:17] <Cork> you can't just re initialize it again
[06:42:23] <Cork> cause that means you will run it twice
[06:48:51] <tirengarfio> ok, thanks
[06:48:57] <Kartagis> Cork: so, what should I use instead of 'data'?
[06:49:14] <Cork> Kartagis: its not instead of data you need to built the strings for data
[06:49:42] <Cork> data: 'p=' + value + '&something=' + value2
[06:58:35] <csdc> can i have two document.ready() ?
[06:58:41] <Cork> yes
[07:03:24] <PCatinean> Hey guys, if there is a event listener in a js file, can one override it by just adding a timeout and then running the original function?
[07:03:29] <PCatinean> I cannot touch the original file
[07:04:01] <Cork> PCatinean: if the event handler is bound with jquery you can unbind the event handler (.off)
[07:04:18] <Cork> you can have multiple event handlers on one element though
[07:04:21] <Cork> so you might not have to
[07:04:50] <PCatinean> Cork, I basically want to do a inherit so to speak, like in python running with super()
[07:05:02] <PCatinean> So I can access the original method just add a delay to it
[07:05:12] <PCatinean> So it's now executed right away
[07:05:15] <Cork> events doesn't work like that
[07:05:38] <Cork> you could remove the original event handler and bind a new one, then call the original function from there
[07:05:45] <carlitux> hey guys, on event delegation I have an error event.target refers to div parent instead of input
[07:05:53] <Cork> if you have access to that function that is
[07:06:29] <Cork> carlitux: event.target is the element you clicked it isn't what you should use for delegation
[07:06:42] <Cork> that would be the "this" variable
[07:07:41] <carlitux> Cork: sorry I am using with backbone so this is bound to object that is why I am trying to use on change event over inputs but target and currentTarget are the div
[07:08:05] <carlitux> that is only in some events, in other are working well
[07:08:25] <Cork> carlitux: in an event handler (defined in how event handlers works in the dom) this is the element the event was bound on (or targeted with delegation)
[07:08:38] <Cork> event.target is always the source of the event
[07:08:49] <Cork> and often not the same as the element you targeted
[07:09:30] <carlitux> so, it depends by browser
[07:09:37] <Cork> for example $('a').click for <a><span>test</span></a>
[07:09:44] <Cork> this will be a and event.target will be span
[07:10:10] <carlitux> oh, I see
[07:10:44] <csdc> why does this work alright in jsfiddle embedded and not on full screen view? http://jsfiddle.net/Tnuuj/41/
[07:10:51] <csdc> contrast with https://jsfiddle.net/Tnuuj/41/embedded/result/
[07:11:06] <Cork> csdc: most likely cause jsfiddle wrapps the code in onload
[07:11:11] <Cork> ah
[07:11:22] <csdc> Cork: hm?
[07:11:36] <Cork> scratch that
[07:11:51] <Cork> jsfiddle none embedded is completely broken now days
[07:12:22] <Cork> so ya... they enforce lots of extra junk around the html so it isn't useful anymore
[07:12:32] <csdc> ah
[07:12:37] <csdc> so i should trust the embedded only
[07:12:45] <csdc> is codepen better in that aspect?
[07:12:58] <Cork> sadly none of them are any good in that aspect anymore
[07:16:09] <csdc> where do i specify additional resources in codepen?
[07:45:50] <PCatinean> Cork, I think I do have access, why shouldn't it?
[07:59:27] <hollusion> can somebody explain to me how numberFormat option works for jquery-ui spinner? i want to force it to "nn,nn"
[07:59:39] <hollusion> tried numberFormat: "d2" but nothing happened
[08:03:03] <Sal> hi
[08:03:10] <arthurvr> hi sal
[08:03:48] <Sal> i'm loading a <div> from a file via ajax. how can i tell ajax that it should be encoded in utf-8?
[08:04:30] <Sal> with css i just add <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> as first line
[08:05:17] <Sal> in html? considering that the code doesn't have any head tag
[08:24:04] <kojak_>  I am setting an onclick handler like this: $('.css').click(function(e) {code});. I would like to access the 'this' object of the assigner code, inside the event handler. How can I do that?
[08:35:13] <spudzee> Iâ€™m having some issues with Math.atan
[08:37:11] <spudzee> so my code is this: segmentAngle = Math.atan( differenceY/differenceX ) * (180 / Math.PI), and Iâ€™ll have differenceY = 9000 and differenceX = 10000, and the thing will give me some bogus answer like 500 degrees
[08:53:33] <Hamzarrr> could anyone here help me ?
[08:53:40] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[08:53:57] <Hamzarrr> robertmaxrees can i PM you please?
[08:54:06] <robertmaxrees> why not just ask in the channel?
[08:54:07] <spudzee> reposting because no one saw it last time
[08:54:08] <spudzee> so my code is this: segmentAngle = Math.atan( differenceY/differenceX ) * (180 / Math.PI), and Iâ€™ll have differenceY = 9000 and differenceX = 10000, and the thing will give me some bogus answer like 500 degrees
[08:54:56] <spudzee> is there something wrong with the code?
[08:54:59] <Hamzarrr> because i need to send you details i can't write them as people everytime write here so you can't catch the problem ..
[08:55:14] <spudzee> Iâ€™m trying to use it to make a graphing calculator
[08:55:20] <robertmaxrees> Hamzarrr huh? if you can PM it to me, you can send it to the channel.
[08:55:38] <spudzee> â€¦itâ€™s supposed to figure out the angle at which lines need to be turned based on the changes in x and y
[08:56:00] <robertmaxrees> spudzee you might have more luck in ##javascript ?  i assume you've asked in there.
[08:56:10] <spudzee> I already have, yes
[08:56:31] <Hamzarrr> robertmaxrees well my problem is i want to load more content when people scroll down (jquery mobile + wordpress as source of data)
[08:56:45] <robertmaxrees> Hamzarrr okay.  that's pretty easy - tons of plugins to do that.
[08:57:42] <Hamzarrr> i want to send you my function that load content and you can help me as i tried many times with no results
[08:57:50] <Hamzarrr> @ robertmaxrees
[08:58:01] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Hamzarrr
[08:58:01] <b-ot> Hamzarrr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:58:10] <robertmaxrees> ^ use one of these services and share the link out.
[08:59:16] <Hamzarrr> @robertmaxrees : http://pastebin.com/wA0unakT
[08:59:52] <Hamzarrr> do you need to take a look at the source JSON im using ? i have it online
[09:00:35] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:00:42] <robertmaxrees> you have some pretty basic errors in here.
[09:00:43] <Hamzarrr> ok bro
[09:01:37] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/ehfisuu/
[09:01:38] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[09:01:57] <robertmaxrees> if it's still broken, i'll need you to clarify how things are broken.
[09:08:14] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees still don't work
[09:08:22] <robertmaxrees> so define what about this "doesn't work"?
[09:08:49] <Hamzaaar> it doesn't load anyposts when i scroll down ..
[09:08:52] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[09:09:10] <robertmaxrees> have you checked your network tab to make sure the requests are firind successfully?
[09:11:05] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees you need to look at API of source i use to understand things
[09:11:51] <robertmaxrees> i ask again - have you checked your network tab to make sure the requests are firing successfully?
[09:12:29] <robertmaxrees> you can very quickly verify some of this for yourself.
[09:13:01] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees yes its fired and grab the first page items but when i scroll it doesn't load the content of page 2 (pagination)
[09:13:36] <robertmaxrees> ... that's because you have the page number statically set in that function.
[09:14:29] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees yes i know but i don't know how to make things works automatically this is the api source i use to get content : http://aitnews.com/?json=get_recent_posts&page=1
[09:14:52] <robertmaxrees> that very different from "doesn't work" - you're just sure how to increment the page number.
[09:14:53] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[09:14:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't need to see the source of the page.
[09:15:04] <robertmaxrees> or the api :)
[09:16:16] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees i think you need to look at the api page to  get the name of the variable who save current page and total of items we can load so when we finish the items it don't load anymore;..
[09:16:31] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/ehfisuu/#url=lelox05 just do this.
[09:18:45] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees i think you miss understood me , i don't need to make a loop but i need to  load content of page 2 when the user finish scroll (bottom of the page)
[09:20:14] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees  are you there sir?
[09:22:17] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees   ??
[09:24:42] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees   ??
[09:24:56] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees  are you there sir?
[09:25:54] <randomguy_> hamzaaar: what robert gave you, should work.  provided you already have the logic to fire that call when the user scrolls to the bottom of the existing content already.
[09:26:56] <Hamzaaar> randomguy_ i don't have any logic call i'm just using this function to load the content of the first page
[09:28:30] <randomguy_> hamzaar: quick google search = http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5609255/javascript-jquery-perform-function-when-user-scrolls-near-bottom-of-page
[09:38:25] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar sorry i was away from my desk for a bit - did randomguy_'s link help?
[09:39:06] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees still im trying and it does't work even the code  randomguy_ sent me
[09:39:16] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have.,
[09:40:10] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees just take a look at api source page then i things will be clear for you please
[09:40:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:40:20] <diphtherial> hey, kind of a silly question, but do any of you happen to know of an off-the-shelf component that's a bit like an excel spreadsheet? like, i'd like to be able to select rows/columns and cut/paste them around, but the table would have a fixed size
[09:40:31] <robertmaxrees> that page has nothing to do with the code to fire on scroll, Hamzaaar
[09:40:42] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar it sounds like you want somebody to write this for you.
[09:41:35] <Hamzaaar> robetmaxrees im a beginner so i have understand things and yes the code thats work it will be the most learning method for me as i analyise it and look who things was done
[09:42:04] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar that explains a lot.  this isn't the right place for something like that.  we'll help you write the code yourself, but we won't write it for you.
[09:42:30] <randomguy_> we provide nudges, :)
[09:42:34] <robertmaxrees> eeexactly.
[09:42:46] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're stuck on how to run code when the user is near the bottom of the page.
[09:42:48] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees it doesn't make a problem for me to show me how i can write it guys
[09:43:20] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:43:25] <diphtherial> meh, i think it's too ambitious to expect them to be able to do excel-like stuff on the page...
[09:43:46] <robertmaxrees> diphtherial i've seen plugings like that before i think.
[09:43:53] <robertmaxrees> i could be wrong - what's the UI you're building?
[09:44:30] <Hamzaaar> so randomguy_ & robertmaxrees
[09:45:13] <wontoner> diphtherial: Possibly extJS could give you some of that functionality?
[09:45:40] <diphtherial> wontoner: interesting, i'll look into it
[09:45:56] <Hamzaaar> any help guys?
[09:46:03] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar with what?
[09:46:10] <diphtherial> robertmaxrees: tbh it's just a "nice to have" for this tiny web app i'm thinking about building for my fiance for dealing with doing shell operations on text
[09:46:18] <robertmaxrees> diphtherial good times.
[09:46:33] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees how to write the code my self i don't know how to implment the idea into my project
[09:46:51] <diphtherial> she goes back and forth between excel a lot to move columns around, etc. so i thought it'd be nice to have some kind of table editor embedded into the page
[09:47:05] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar we can help with that.  the first step is to learn how to run code when the user gets near the bottom of the page, right?
[09:47:26] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees yes right
[09:47:36] <diphtherial> otherwise it's just going to take a text buffer and a command and produce the result in a second text box with a place to put the next command in the chain, repeat ad infinitum
[09:47:59] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar cool - a quick google search gives you http://stackoverflow.com/a/5609295/923919
[09:48:05] <diphtherial> haven't quite thought about how it's going to run bash commands in a way that's not insanely insecure, but i'll cross that bridge when i get there, i guess
[09:48:48] <decx> that stack will show you how not to do it
[09:48:48] <robertmaxrees> have pre-prepared statements that are parameterized and escaped.
[09:48:56] <robertmaxrees> decx oooh - how would you do it?
[09:49:04] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah, cache window, et al.
[09:49:08] <diphtherial> that's a really good idea, actually, since the set of operations she needs is small
[09:49:13] <decx> obviously getting height every scroll is terrible
[09:49:35] <decx> save the number you care about on load and resize and run that agaisnt scrollTop
[09:49:36] <notchris> Can you find out in developer tools which script is hiding an element?
[09:49:40] <robertmaxrees> decx this is true, but since it's this person's first rodeo, i'd suggest focusing on the core of the functionality.
[09:49:55] <decx> oh this is for newblood
[09:49:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[09:49:59] <decx> oh well i'll allow it ;)
[09:50:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:50:07] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees i  created a function called init and past the code into it so then ?
[09:50:18] <randomguy_> i'd be interested in seeing your method decx, :D
[09:50:28] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar for now, just stick the code you want to run where that alert(); current is.
[09:50:31] <robertmaxrees> *currently
[09:50:39] <decx> well i outlined all that mattered already randomguy_
[09:50:55] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar inline the function instead of passing anything around.
[09:51:09] <randomguy_> cool, i'll checkout the logs
[09:51:17] <decx> it's like one line ^^
[09:51:38] <robertmaxrees> randomguy_ mostly it's about doing var $window = $(window); BEFORE binding the listener and using that var instead.
[09:52:05] <randomguy_> ah
[09:52:54] <robertmaxrees> same with $(document)
[09:53:37] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees this is what i have now : http://jsfiddle.net/ez2pam2j/2/
[09:54:07] <notchris> If I have a set of images within a div and have set up a click function to change the image, how do I get the next image
[09:54:10] <randomguy_> here's an off topic question.  i'm starting to play around with the concept of using a pubsub model for decoupling class objects.  Is there any performance degredation with doing this vs direct method calls?  And is pubsub more efficient than doing delegated dom events?
[09:56:34] <randomguy_> notchris: how are your images structured?  are they all on the same level and sibling images are just hidden, or what?
[09:56:48] <notchris> <div><img><img<img><div>
[09:57:03] <notchris> Iâ€™m going to attempt the approved solution via: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16611694/jquery-find-next-image-after-the-clicked-instance
[09:57:42] <randomguy_> notchris: if your click event is on the displayed image, you could do $(this).next() to get to the next image.  not sure if that wraps at the last child though.
[09:58:18] <Hamzaaar> are you still there robertmaxrees ?
[09:59:37] <wontoner> Does anyone know of other javascript programming challenge applications, similar to this one? http://games.usvsth3m.com/javascript-under-pressure/
[09:59:44] <Jhuliette> I'm getting this from php ::: [{"id":"0","mensaje":"Invitacion para participar en nuestro estudio"}]
[09:59:44] <Jhuliette> how can I access it from jquery?
[10:00:27] <randomguy_> Jhuliette: $.parseJSON( jsonString )
[10:01:19] <Jhuliette> randomguy : I'm get undefined
[10:01:52] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar sorry was off in a meeting. you can ask the room :)
[10:02:05] <randomguy_> Jhuliette: you replaced "jsonString" with the variable containing "[{"id":"0","mensaje":"Invitacion para participar en nuestro estudio"}]" ?
[10:02:24] <Hamzaaar> can you complete what robet started with me randomguy_ ?
[10:02:37] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar literally no reason to use an init functioon here.
[10:03:12] <robertmaxrees> that was also invalid code.
[10:03:18] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees im build an app so i crearted this function so  i can call it when the app is loaded ..
[10:03:22] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ez2pam2j/3/
[10:03:43] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use an init function, feel free to use instead of that iife.
[10:03:53] <Jhuliette> http://jsfiddle.net/h5wf4fLm/
[10:03:57] <Jhuliette> this is my script
[10:04:38] <randomguy_> Jhuliette: your string is surrounded with [] so that is an array.  to access id you'd have to do variable[0].id
[10:06:00] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees the code you sent me only load one time when i scroll down the page and it load content but when i scroll it an other time it doesn't load anything
[10:06:44] <robertmaxrees> that's probably because you have a scoping issue witht he currentPage var - show me your code again.
[10:07:46] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/ez2pam2j/4/
[10:08:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's why.
[10:08:59] <robertmaxrees> and you still have a bunch of undeclared vars in here.
[10:09:44] <randomguy_> Jhuliette: http://jsfiddle.net/h5wf4fLm/1/
[10:09:49] <Hamzaaar> robetmaxrees all variable is declared in the rest of the .js file don't worry the problem is only with the init function
[10:10:06] <randomguy_> brb, apparently the chrome irc doesn't auto scroll to the bottom... annoying
[10:10:23] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar that's a really bad idea then. you shouldn't be declaring global vars like that, especially when ajax is invlolved.
[10:11:04] <robertmaxrees> either wya, you want something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ez2pam2j/5/
[10:13:19] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees still don't load items on the second time i scroll down the page ..
[10:13:50] <robertmaxrees> okay - have you tried adding console logs to see what's breaking?
[10:13:56] <robertmaxrees> checking the network tab of your dev tools?
[10:14:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to troubleshoot the issue?
[10:16:23] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees no errors at all just the function load items only once ..
[10:17:06] <oste> anyone know of a good infinite scroll implementation?
[10:17:06] <robertmaxrees> are you seeing another network request fire?  have you added a console.log() to that scroll handler to make sure it's reaching that part of the code?
[10:17:20] <oste> trying to decide on how to make it happen
[10:18:22] <randomguy_> lol, infinite scroll is all the rage it seems
[10:18:27] <robertmaxrees> seriously.
[10:18:58] <oste> i am no fan
[10:19:00] <randomguy_> oste no offense meant at you
[10:19:13] <oste> just doing what i am told haha
[10:19:40] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees i added console.log and it show me it one time and stop with no error
[10:21:11] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense, then: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5g8bL97e/1/
[10:21:15] <randomguy_> oste not sure if there is a "prefered" method to doing it with jquery.  it's primarily having an endpoint that takes in a parameter to get your desired pagination, and an event handler that kicks it off when you reach the bottom of the page.
[10:21:36] <oste> yeah the event is what i am concerned about
[10:21:49] <robertmaxrees> oste you want the window scroll
[10:22:07] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees that's exactly what im doing here and the same result
[10:22:30] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar obviously you're not getting the same result because the code i just shared runs every time you hit the bottom of the page.
[10:24:22] <oste> cool yeah i did something in angular a while back - basically just check to see if the element has been scrolled to
[10:24:23] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees im getting the same sir and it does print only one and stop
[10:24:28] <oste> using scrollTop and offset().top
[10:24:59] <robertmaxrees> "print only one" console log?
[10:25:10] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees yes
[10:25:17] <robertmaxrees> that is not what i'm seeing at all.
[10:25:24] <robertmaxrees> are youg etting that with the fiddle as well?
[10:27:20] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees no on js fiddle works
[10:27:32] <robertmaxrees> Hamzaaar what version of jquery are you running on your page?
[10:29:30] <Hamzaaar> robertmaxrees now it works the problem is i  have to scroll up and then down an other time to trigger the function an other time
[10:29:39] <Hamzaaar> there is any solution to overcame this situation ?
[10:30:21] <robertmaxrees> sure - though now i have to ask: is there a reason you aren't using any of the available infinite scroll libraries out there?
[10:31:01] <randomguy_> until your logic is adding additional content when it fires, you're going to have that state Hamzaaar
[10:39:45] <Hamzaaar> randomguy_ , robertmaxrees thank you
[10:39:54] <robertmaxrees> figure it out?
[11:00:35] <cj> var rx = new RegExp('^([^.]+)(?:\\\.(.+)){2,}$'); 'www.colliertech.org'.match(rx);
[11:00:38] <cj> Array [ "www.colliertech.org", "www", "org" ]
[11:01:11] <cj> that's not what I'm going for... I want it to return ... oh, right... the .+ is greedy...
[11:01:33] <randomguy_> o_O
[11:02:10] <cj> randomguy_: :-)
[11:02:32] <cj> can someone help me figure out the best way to separate that hostname from the rest of the domain name?
[11:02:44] <cj> while specifying that the domain name must have at least one . in it
[11:06:46] <randomguy_> cj: quick hostname getter http://jsfiddle.net/1mcod616/
[11:07:19] <cj> thanks man
[11:08:08] <cj> that's cute, but not what I'm after :-)
[11:09:25] <randomguy_> more specifics?
[11:09:27] <cj> given var fqdn='www.colliertech.org'; or the like, I want to a) use the regex to test that fqdn is valid (has at least two . separators) and b, return the host / domain portions of the fqdn
[11:09:52] <seth_> snover: thanks for the answers yesterday. Got disconnected and ended up getting beers with people from that meetup, but appreciated the time you took =]
[11:10:26] <robertmaxrees> cj why use regex?
[11:10:50] <robertmaxrees> also, a valid host can have just one period.
[11:11:55] <randomguy_> or none ("localhost"
[11:12:00] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:12:10] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[11:13:35] <cj> robertmaxrees: yes, yes.  I'm not talking about any valid host, I'm talking about hosts that this form will manage.  We expect that each record has a host part and a domain part, where the domain is not a top-level domain
[11:14:17] <robertmaxrees> you can .split() the string and make sure it's got a length of at least 2.
[11:14:41] <cj> robertmaxrees: yeah, split is probably less expensive than a regex.  thanks!
[11:18:08] <adv_> how can i get the height of this div? <div class="galleria-container notouch" style="width: 653px; height: 587px;">
[11:18:44] <randomguy_> $('.galleria-container').css('height')
[11:18:58] <randomguy_> if it does not change
[11:19:47] <adv_> randomguy_: how do i get, not set
[11:20:01] <randomguy_> that is a getter.  it is only a setter if you pass in a second parameter
[11:20:05] <adv_> ah thanks
[11:20:19] <randomguy_> polymorphism!
[11:20:24] <randomguy_> :D
[11:21:34] <adv_> randomguy_: when i console.log it it says undefined :/
[11:21:56] <randomguy_> what do you get if you console log just the result of the selector?
[11:22:07] <randomguy_> oh
[11:22:09] <randomguy_> sorry
[11:22:11] <adv_> randomguy_: i do that
[11:22:12] <randomguy_> escape the - with \\
[11:22:55] <adv_> hm? didn't work
[11:23:04] <adv_> you mean like$('.galleria\-container').css('height');
[11:23:11] <randomguy_> double slash
[11:23:15] <adv_> same thing
[11:23:37] <adv_> undefined
[11:24:22] <adv_> maybe it's not created yet?
[11:24:23] <randomguy_> adv_: example http://jsfiddle.net/fL8xhL3v/
[11:24:30] <adv_> should i put a setTimeout?
[11:24:38] <randomguy_> so if your like that and still undefined, yes
[11:24:53] <randomguy_> err, not sure on the set timeout
[11:25:09] <adv_> i have the code in document.ready
[11:25:18] <adv_> shouldnt that make sure that it's ready?
[11:25:41] <adv_> randomguy_: yes your example prints undefined too
[11:25:51] <randomguy_> huh
[11:26:04] <adv_> so it isn't ready yet
[11:26:12] <randomguy_> i'm seeing the height printed in mine
[11:26:16] <adv_> should i have it in pagecreate or something?
[11:26:44] <adv_> yes but yours is hardcoded, mine is generated by the galleria script
[11:26:51] <adv_> it's a jquery plugin
[11:27:13] <adv_> that's why i'm saying that it might not be ready/available yet
[11:27:24] <adv_> how can i make sure it's available ?
[11:27:43] <randomguy_> document ready should make sure all javascript files are retrieved first
[11:27:51] <randomguy_> is the content being created dynamically?
[11:27:57] <adv_> yes
[11:28:47] <randomguy_> your going to need to have a way to know that whatever is building that has already executed.  hard for me to tell that without seeing some source
[11:29:45] <randomguy_> you could try a setTimeout, but you'd have to make sure to set it large enough to make sure it is done first, which might not be the best approach
[11:29:57] <adv_> randomguy_: http://jsfiddle.net/7pxa2uzk/2/
[11:31:31] <randomguy_> move your log inside the ready
[11:31:53] <randomguy_> http://jsfiddle.net/7pxa2uzk/3/
[11:37:48] <adv_> thanks randomguy_
[11:38:25] <randomguy_> np, sorry for the \\ nonsense.  i forget sometimes what characters have to be escaped in selectors
[11:43:57] <maximski> i saw once a site where the pitch text was like "experience freedom" or something and then the word "freedom" got replaced with "happiness" and then with "the word doesn't matter" with some nice slide effect
[11:44:12] <maximski> does anyone here know a jquery plugin that can do this?
[11:45:17] <rubyonrailed> I'm appending a table row with select fields.  In my console I have access to the appended selects val().  But when i'm trying to get the val from a function, it's returning null.  Does anyone know why I can't get this value?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/21284dde3c7e07664e0b
[11:46:21] <Krinkle> https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Release_Engineering/SAL
[11:46:24] <Krinkle> wrong chan
[11:52:34] <randomguy_> rubyonrailed: what element is the id on?
[11:52:55] <randomguy_> rubyonrailed: the '#district_'
[11:53:07] <rubyonrailed> randomguy_ yeah
[11:53:52] <randomguy_> are those ids on the select elements, or on a part of the table structure, or what?
[11:54:03] <rubyonrailed> select elements
[11:54:50] <randomguy_> what do you get if you log just: $('#district_' + row + '') ?
[12:00:48] <rubyonrailed> randomguy_: I figured it out, it was trying to get the value inbetween it beign cleared out and re-populated
[12:01:03] <randomguy_> cool
[12:01:34] <randomguy_> i was fixing to suggest you might be missing a default <option selected></option> :)
[12:02:00] <creativename> sup
[12:02:19] <creativename> how can I change the class of something??
[12:02:36] <randomguy_> $(selector).removeClass(classname).addClass(newClassName)
[12:02:39] <creativename> like do I have to  empty it then add new or can I replace?
[12:02:49] <creativename> ah so remove it by name
[12:02:50] <creativename> ok
[12:02:51] <randomguy_> you can do both, or either/or
[12:02:58] <creativename> thanks
[12:24:16] <se_busca_ayuda> randomguy_, do you really need the "+''"? I always do mine without it and it works fine
[12:24:25] <randomguy_> nope
[12:24:31] <randomguy_> was just copy and pasting
[12:24:38] <se_busca_ayuda> k XD
[12:24:44] <randomguy_> ^_^
[12:28:28] <igyiguygyu> Can anyone help me out? Trying to make this email form to work using ajax but it keeps giving me 400 error. No idea why. :/ https://jsfiddle.net/j1220mme/
[12:33:24] <igyiguygyu> Can't figure out where the code is broken. Googling similar issues usually the problem is that the data is not serialized. I serialize it :/
[12:34:32] <randomguy_> have you looked at the network console to see the actual request?  400 is bad request, so the request being sent to the back end is malformed or something
[12:34:47] <robertmaxrees> you want serializeArray() probably.
[12:35:03] <robertmaxrees> the format you're sending and what your backend is expecting are very different.
[12:35:36] <robertmaxrees> serialize() is sending things over as a string - you probably want serializeArray(), though then your backend will need to enumerate over the array and pull out the data you want.
[12:39:10] <igyiguygyu> Hmm, with serializeArray() it gives me a bit more than just 400 bad request -
[12:39:24] <robertmaxrees> right.  echo out what you're getting from your backend.
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> the data isn't formed the way you think it is ;)
[12:39:36] <chema> hello people
[12:40:03] <chema> can someone help me with a ajax cuestion?
[12:40:07] <robertmaxrees> of course!
[12:40:08] <robertmaxrees> just ask!
[12:40:51] <chema> i want to call an specific method in php a php file with post or get
[12:41:00] <targetron> is there a simple way to add a button after an input file using jquery?
[12:41:11] <robertmaxrees> chema that's not a very good idea.
[12:41:17] <chema> why
[12:41:31] <igyiguygyu> POST http://url.com/mailer.php 400 (Bad Request)jquery-1.11.2.min.js:4 m.ajaxTransport.sendjquery-1.11.2.min.js:4 m.extend.ajaxapp.js:23 (anonymous function)jquery-1.11.2.min.js:2 m.Callbacks.jjquery-1.11.2.min.js:2 m.Callbacks.k.fireWithjquery-1.11.2.min.js:2 m.extend.readyjquery-1.11.2.min.js:2 J
[12:41:37] <igyiguygyu> this is what I saw in console now
[12:41:44] <igyiguygyu> whoops sorry for bad format
[12:41:48] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu echo from the PHP side before you try to parse anything.
[12:42:04] <robertmaxrees> chema do you mean you want to hit a specific URL and have that run some PHP code?
[12:42:14] <chema> yep
[12:42:25] <chema> a method
[12:42:27] <robertmaxrees> oh, heh, okay.  you'll want to ask in ##php.
[12:42:28] <igyiguygyu> I'm not gonna lie, haven't had much experience with backend side of things
[12:42:35] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu you'll need to learn :)
[12:42:41] <robertmaxrees> that's where your error is in this case.
[12:42:41] <chema> but im using jquery
[12:42:48] <igyiguygyu> Eventually yesâ€¦
[12:42:59] <robertmaxrees> chema but you need to write php to do the first part.
[12:43:28] <igyiguygyu> I checked the Cpanel php error log, and no errors show up there
[12:43:30] <chema> i have it
[12:43:38] <robertmaxrees> chema then what's your question?
[12:43:59] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu i'm not very familiar with php but there should be some kind of way to echo out the post body.
[12:44:09] <robertmaxrees> basically, comment out everything else and just echo out the response.
[12:44:46] <chema> i was wondering to do something like $.post("file.php/mehtod",data,function({}));
[12:44:52] <randomguy_> you can var dump the $_POST
[12:45:00] <randomguy_> in php
[12:45:00] <robertmaxrees> chema you don't specify the function in your JS
[12:45:28] <chema> i cant?
[12:45:35] <chema> or im not doing it?
[12:45:40] <robertmaxrees> chema that's a dangerous thing to do.
[12:45:52] <robertmaxrees> you should expose a specific function/method to a specific url.
[12:46:20] <chema> yes i do "file.php/method"
[12:46:32] <robertmaxrees> then you're fine.
[12:46:37] <chema> but i dont get a result
[12:46:48] <robertmaxrees> try /file.php/method
[12:46:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm not familar with how php handles routing btw.
[12:47:12] <robertmaxrees> so you might need to specify somewhere that url maps to a given function.
[12:47:35] <randomguy_> unless you do something special, it's all script, no routing
[12:47:53] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you're not exposing every function globally like that.
[12:48:28] <randomguy_> so i'm not sure that file.php/method is valid
[12:48:37] <chema> what you mean globally
[12:49:10] <robertmaxrees> chema you want to avoid making it so you can just /anyFile.php/anyMethodorFunction
[12:49:11] <chema> with $.post dont expose
[12:49:24] <igyiguygyu> Still not sure how to echo out the problem, but through logic I'm figuring out that the 400 error is given because of line 12 in php file (https://jsfiddle.net/j1220mme/). That being said, I think the form is not getting the data from the js file. What do you guys think?
[12:49:43] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu right - the PHP doesn't know how to parse your post body.
[12:49:58] <igyiguygyu> If i would have to guess the problem might be starting from line 17 in js file
[12:50:01] <lando23> has anyone written a javascript library over google sheets?
[12:50:12] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu the issue is not in your JS>
[12:50:17] <randomguy_> var_dump($_POST); --> http://php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php
[12:50:20] <robertmaxrees> it's in your PHP - you're not parsing the post body correctly.
[12:50:26] <lando23> it turns out that google does some wierdness to make accessing DOM diffuicult in Sheets.
[12:51:01] <igyiguygyu> robertmaxrees: you're saying then that the problem is starting from line 4 - 9 in php?
[12:51:18] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu i don't know PHP so i'm not going to try to venture a guess there.
[12:51:31] <robertmaxrees> but the issue is you're shoving data at your PHP and when it tries to parse it, it breaks.
[12:52:06] <igyiguygyu> hmm... No idea why :(
[12:52:42] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: php doesn't use the word "OR"
[12:52:55] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: ||
[12:53:23] <robertmaxrees> also, i'm going to guess that $_POST is a hash or associative array - so $_POST["name"] is trying to access the name property in there, except that there is no name property.
[12:54:19] <robertmaxrees> if you use serializeArray(), you're sending an array over that looks like [{'name':'foo'}, {'group', 'bar'}]
[12:54:30] <robertmaxrees> err, {'group': 'bar'}
[12:54:44] <robertmaxrees> you can't access those by name - you need to enumerate through the array or otherwise access things by index.
[12:54:53] <chema> ok thanks for helping me robert
[12:55:07] <robertmaxrees> chema the idea is pretty basic either way :)
[12:55:39] <chema> yes i know i have done ajax before but no calling a specific method
[12:56:05] <chema> i saw it somewhere but dont remember
[12:56:45] <chema> thanks :)
[12:58:47] <igyiguygyu> robertmaxrees: in the input there is name property? Not really sure what you meant by that. NoiseEee: changing OR with || didn't seem to make any difference
[12:59:03] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: mm indeed, my bad
[12:59:20] <robertmaxrees> igyiguygyu the html isn't what's getting sent ;)
[12:59:21] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: either way i'd look at your var_dump of $_POST in php, pastebin that somewhere / move this to ##php
[13:00:25] <igyiguygyu> can't join #php or ##php
[13:00:34] <NoiseEee> register your nick with nickserv
[13:03:48] <igyiguygyu> Ok, trying it out at ##php
[13:06:32] <metastableB> Hi, can some one help with an ImageMapster plugin I'm trying to use to get my area tags in the image map to be interactive
[13:06:38] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ metastableB
[13:06:38] <b-ot> metastableB: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:07:00] <robertmaxrees> :) feel free to make a fiddle or bin
[13:07:13] <metastableB> I'm not getting any errors on the webbrowser through the debugger, here is the code https://dpaste.de/vvHL
[13:07:26] <metastableB> I'v marked comments in the important portions
[13:07:29] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid document btw.
[13:07:59] <metastableB> this is my first attempt at jQuery or webdev
[13:08:15] <robertmaxrees> you can't put anything between </head> and <body>
[13:08:32] <robertmaxrees> take all your JS and move it to just before those closing </body> instead.
[13:08:54] <robertmaxrees> also you're missing a doctype - put <!doctype html> as the very first line of the whole file.
[13:09:08] <metastableB> I didnt know that. All the JS worked fine except the ImageMapster lines
[13:09:17] <metastableB> I'll add those changes
[13:09:57] <robertmaxrees> i also don't a closing html tag anywhere either.
[13:10:13] <robertmaxrees> you also have 3 versions of jquery loading.
[13:10:29] <se_busca_ayuda> i'd start over if i were you
[13:10:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:10:38] <metastableB> its just part of the code, the whole thing is a mess. About 1000+ lines, Should I paste that ?
[13:10:44] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:10:56] <metastableB> All of those were codes from the internet , i really dont know much of what I'm doing here :(
[13:10:58] <robertmaxrees> you have some pretty critical problems here.
[13:11:07] <robertmaxrees> back up - what's the basic goal here?
[13:11:24] <metastableB> Towards the end of the file you'll se an image map
[13:11:47] <metastableB> I need the area tags to lite up on mouse hower and color up on mouse click
[13:11:56] <metastableB> which is what ImageMapster allows us to do
[13:12:11] <robertmaxrees> setup a simplified version of what you've got here: http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:12:32] <robertmaxrees> you should only need jquery, the library, your init code, and some very basic HTML.
[13:12:40] <metastableB> http://outsharked.com/imagemapster/
[13:12:50] <robertmaxrees> great - link that in the fiddle.
[13:13:20] <metastableB> sure, thanks a lot for your help :) , I'v been strugling for hours with this!!
[13:13:48] <robertmaxrees> here, start with this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7txyr3bg/
[13:13:54] <robertmaxrees> that has jquery and the plugin loaded.
[13:14:00] <robertmaxrees> just needs your basic html and js.
[13:14:44] <metastableB> thank you :)
[13:14:47] <metastableB> Just back in a moment
[13:15:12] <hd1> how do I get the text value of an element like '<td id="foo">'?
[13:15:18] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[13:15:24] <robertmaxrees> $('#foo').text();
[13:17:48] <hd1> grrr...
[13:18:00] <robertmaxrees> do you have multiple items with the same ID?
[13:18:15] <hd1> robertmaxrees: '<td id="target2">foo</td>'
[13:18:21] <hd1> nope
[13:18:24] <robertmaxrees> $('#target2').text()
[13:18:46] <hd1> getting blank
[13:18:48] <hd1> on firefix
[13:18:54] <hd1> firefox
[13:19:05] <hd1> $('#target2').text()
[13:19:06] <hd1> ""
[13:19:13] <se_busca_ayuda> sounds like you're not assigning it to anything.
[13:19:26] <se_busca_ayuda> it's kind of like saying "stand over there!" and the computer stands over there and when its done it comes back
[13:19:27] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to GET the value, not set it.
[13:19:57] <se_busca_ayuda> i mean assinging it to another variable or function XD
[13:20:02] <robertmaxrees> hd1 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6go5jkja/
[13:21:07] <se_busca_ayuda> what's the term for a go-no-where function? ummm,, bad...
[13:21:09] <se_busca_ayuda> bad programming?
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:21:16] <robertmaxrees> what are you talking about?
[13:21:18] <se_busca_ayuda> not u
[13:21:20] <se_busca_ayuda> hd1
[13:21:28] <robertmaxrees> my question still stands.
[13:21:33] <robertmaxrees> what areyou referring to?
[13:21:54] <se_busca_ayuda> lets see the code hd1
[13:33:49] <metastableB> robertmaxrees:  https://jsfiddle.net/7txyr3bg/1/
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:34:01] <metastableB> Hi, I didnt know How to really use fiddle
[13:34:14] <robertmaxrees> i already linked in jquery and the library
[13:34:18] <metastableB> I'v added comments to clarify
[13:34:23] <robertmaxrees> also, having two versions of jquery is a BAD thing.
[13:34:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7txyr3bg/2/
[13:35:03] <metastableB> I'll add the later one.
[13:35:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:35:09] <robertmaxrees> later one what?
[13:35:19] <metastableB> the latest among the two versions
[13:35:24] <metastableB> wont that work
[13:35:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't need it.
[13:35:28] <robertmaxrees> it's already linked.
[13:35:28] <metastableB>  ?
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> see the dropdown in the upper left?
[13:35:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7txyr3bg/4/  with better formatting.
[13:35:53] <metastableB> yea, was talking about the code here , on my notepad
[13:35:58] <robertmaxrees> also, onclick is bad.
[13:36:16] <metastableB> what should I use then ? In place of that /
[13:36:26] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:36:46] <robertmaxrees> check out http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/ for a good tutorial.
[13:37:09] <metastableB> Let me see f I can upload the image as well, that'll be better
[13:37:26] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to put it somewhere like imgur that you can hotlink to.
[13:37:36] <metastableB> thanks a lot :) I'll go through them at once, I have to finish this very soon. Part of a project
[13:37:44] <metastableB> sure. just a min
[13:41:44] <targetron> ok so I â€˜m trying to download an html from a website using ajax
[13:41:51] <targetron> why is it giving me access control allow orgin block?
[13:42:00] <targetron> Why do I need permission to load the html?
[13:42:04] <robertmaxrees> targetron because the server you're trying to download from won't allow it.
[13:42:10] <NoiseEee> targetron: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy
[13:42:14] <targetron> what. That makes no sense
[13:42:17] <targetron> How is it allowed to do that
[13:42:20] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[13:42:20] <NoiseEee> lol
[13:42:24] <targetron> I can access the webpage just fine on my browser
[13:42:25] <NoiseEee> targetron: use your backend if you want
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:42:36] <robertmaxrees> targetron so here's the short version: do you use gmail?
[13:42:36] <targetron> then how do javascript scrappers work?
[13:42:46] <NoiseEee> they don't
[13:42:48] <metastableB> robertmaxrees:  I'v uploaded the image and hotlinked as well
[13:42:53] <metastableB> thhe image is here btw
[13:42:54] <metastableB> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7txyr3bg/4/
[13:43:01] <metastableB> Its just a test image
[13:43:03] <robertmaxrees> you need to hit "update" and share the new link, metastableB
[13:43:37] <robertmaxrees> targetron think of it this way, if CORS didn't exist, i could craft a page that, when you visited it, would go to mail.google.com (or any other email provider) and scrape the contents of the page under your account.
[13:43:39] <metastableB> https://jsfiddle.net/7txyr3bg/5/
[13:43:41] <targetron> Then how come this jquery plugin can do it: https://github.com/markserbol/urlive
[13:43:43] <metastableB> Sorry about that
[13:43:45] <robertmaxrees> because your browser is the one making he request.
[13:43:46] <targetron> It literally scrapes websites
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> it's hitting via yahoo
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> backend server
[13:45:13] <robertmaxrees> targetron great - so implement .on() or .click() instead of the inline code you've got now.
[13:45:46] <targetron> ya that plugin isnâ€™t even working
[13:45:55] <targetron> when I include it, it throws ajax error
[13:49:39] <DasLumberJackYa> Hello All,  Is a hidden field the best way to handle having autocomplete on a field that completes the name of a server side record but sends the id of that record in the form?
[13:49:52] <DasLumberJackYa> Let me know if I need to reword
[13:49:59] <metastableB> robertmaxrees: Did you see the code ?
[13:50:13] <robertmaxrees> metastableB yep - sure do.
[13:50:19] <metastableB> I'v deleted all the CSS as well, so there wont be any formatiing or anything
[13:50:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .on() or .click() though.
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> i've said this like twice now.
[13:51:04] <metastableB> sure will do once I get the ImageMapster working
[13:51:21] <robertmaxrees> it won't ever work in the fiddle because you've got errors that'll prevent us from moving forward.
[13:51:33] <targetron> Ok, anyone know why Iâ€™m getting cannot read property â€˜ajaxâ€™ of undefined?
[13:51:38] <targetron> I literally did nothing
[13:51:54] <targetron> except including this file in my header: https://github.com/markserbol/urlive/blob/master/jquery.urlive.js
[13:51:59] <targetron> I didnâ€™t even run it or anything
[13:52:02] <robertmaxrees> metastableB http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 this might be worht a read if you really aren't interested in making your code a bit better.
[13:52:11] <robertmaxrees> targetron did you include jquery before that file
[13:52:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:52:16] <targetron> yes
[13:52:25] <robertmaxrees> is noconflict mode turned on?
[13:52:27] <metastableB> can you tell me what exactly I have to do with the plugin, I'll get to fixing the errors then.
[13:52:40] <robertmaxrees> metastableB not really - i'm showing you how i'd fix the problem.
[13:52:57] <targetron> robertmaxrees: https://imgur.com/7meFY6o
[13:52:59] <metastableB> robertmaxrees: sorry, its not that. i'v been stuck on this for very long. I hope you understand
[13:53:00] <targetron> what is noconflict mode?
[13:53:05] <robertmaxrees> metastableB huh?
[13:53:07] <metastableB> thanks for all your help :)
[13:53:16] <robertmaxrees> targetron go to your console and type $.fn.jquery - what do you get?
[13:53:36] <robertmaxrees> metastableB btw try just doing $('#map').mapster();
[13:53:42] <robertmaxrees> that alert() call in there was bad.
[13:53:52] <targetron> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> targetron that's why.
[13:54:00] <metastableB> ah. I was attempting to debug using that :(
[13:54:01] <targetron> oh?
[13:54:04] <robertmaxrees> targetron now try jQuery.fn.jquery
[13:54:18] <targetron> same thing
[13:54:19] <targetron> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined
[13:54:26] <metastableB> robertmaxrees: The initail code didnt have it, still wasnt working. I'll read through the links and come back
[13:54:27] <robertmaxrees> targetron then you're not loading jquery at all.
[13:54:32] <targetron> but I am
[13:54:32] <robertmaxrees> make sure your include is valid.
[13:54:34] <targetron> I can select using $
[13:54:45] <robertmaxrees> targetron $ is a shortcut in chrome for document.querySelectorAll()
[13:54:55] <robertmaxrees> if jquery isn't loaded i mean/.
[13:55:10] <targetron> but Iâ€™m doing $ in my js file
[13:55:23] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.
[13:55:49] <robertmaxrees> wait, actually, your code is bombing out before it's hitting anything else.
[13:55:50] <robertmaxrees> soooo...
[13:56:53] <Jaxian> Hi, I'm having trouble creating JQueryUI ticket using bugs.jqueryui.com.  I don't suppose anyone in here might be able to help with that?
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> Jaxian ask in #jquery-dev
[13:57:18] <Jaxian> Can do.  I'm in there currently, but it's a bit quiet at the moment.
[13:57:24] <Jaxian> I'll just wait a bit longer.
[13:57:25] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter :)
[13:57:28] <robertmaxrees> if they can help, they will.
[13:57:39] <robertmaxrees> oh or try #jqueryui-dev
[13:57:53] <robertmaxrees> just because it's quiet doesn't mean people won't see it.
[13:57:59] <Jaxian> Oh, jqueryui-dev is the one I'm in, actually.  I'll try #jquery-dev
[13:58:04] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[13:58:06] <robertmaxrees> use the first.
[13:58:42] <Jaxian> Wait, sorry.  Which one are you saying I should use?
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> #jqueryui-dev
[13:59:00] <Jaxian> Can do, thanks!
[14:01:27] <hd1> page is http://links.d8u.us/
[14:02:17] <hd1> and I'm trying to overwrite URLs with the result of http://links.d8u.us/title?url=$('link').text()
[14:02:26] <robertmaxrees> why not do that server-side?
[14:02:55] <hd1> robertmaxrees: because it takes too long to load, if I do so serverside
[14:03:06] <robertmaxrees> O.o it really shouldn't.
[14:03:12] <hd1> (and I'd like to learn me some Javascript)
[14:04:00] <robertmaxrees> so here's a simplified version of the markup: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wcjLgudt/1/
[14:04:04] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried so far?
[14:05:42] <hd1> $('target2').text() gives me "TypeError $() is null"
[14:05:51] <robertmaxrees> that means you don't have jquery loaded in the page.
[14:06:06] <hd1> in your fragment
[14:06:16] <robertmaxrees> btw //code.jquery.com/jquery-git1.min.js is not what you want
[14:06:25] <robertmaxrees> and that's not how you target a class - $('.target2')
[14:06:42] <hd1> what do i want then?
[14:06:46] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you.
[14:06:56] <robertmaxrees> $('.target2')
[14:06:56] <hd1> for loading jquery?
[14:07:27] <robertmaxrees> oh, try <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[14:09:02] <hd1> permission denied to access object
[14:09:09] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:09:13] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing that?
[14:09:38] <hd1> jquery.lint.js, seemingly
[14:09:56] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle?
[14:10:10] <robertmaxrees> or on your page?
[14:10:15] <hd1> my page
[14:10:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:10:24] <hd1> your page doesn't have jquery loaded
[14:10:32] <robertmaxrees> yes it does :)
[14:11:04] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/CpyVFEL.png all you need for the fiddle.
[14:12:41] <hd1> and I see that too, robertmaxrees
[14:13:16] <robertmaxrees> sooo http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wcjLgudt/2/
[14:13:20] <robertmaxrees> jquery is loaded.
[14:13:41] <robertmaxrees> if you're trying to access jquery using your console, don't - the fiddle loads everything into an iframe
[14:16:14] <metastableB> robertmaxrees: I can conform that ImageMapster is being called ( I did a complete strip down of my code and fixed up all the errors fireBug showed me) . Still no luck :(
[14:16:29] <metastableB> More digging in
[14:17:54] <robertmaxrees> and you're configuring everything correctly?
[14:18:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking at the examples on http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/default.aspx?demos.html and it seems pretty straightforward.
[14:19:26] <hd1> I'm trying to see the console output in fiddle now
[14:19:29] <metastableB> I think so. My jQuery is about next to nothing. Trying now to change random thngs to make it work
[14:19:31] <metastableB> things*
[14:19:36] * hd1 wonders where said output is
[14:20:39] <metastableB> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/tPaezk8m
[14:21:04] <metastableB> This should be the only required function. As per the home page
[14:21:18] <metastableB> even the beginer demos are working fine, just this one isnt
[14:21:31] <metastableB> ignore my stupid error message please
[14:30:36] <metastableB> robertmaxrees: This is the final working code. Well except for the imageMapster part. Just 100 lines, if you could please give it a quick glance
[14:30:47] <metastableB> I still havent used the on() call yet.
[14:30:52] <metastableB> please ignore that
[14:40:27] <hd1> you've used the same selector more than once
[14:40:31] <hd1> fsck
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> hd1 the console output is apart of your browsers dev tools
[14:45:30] <robertmaxrees> metastableB it looks like you might need to give it more info than that for it to work.
[14:46:44] <metastableB> robertmaxrees: It seems so, I'll spend more time, I think finally i'm onto something
[14:49:57] <hd1> that's nice, robertmaxrees
[14:50:10] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:55:23] <t-ask> AAM i right that jquery also scans SVGs (objects) to select their classes, ids?
[14:56:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.  it kind of works, but not reall.
[14:56:10] <robertmaxrees> *really
[14:56:50] <robertmaxrees> HTML DOM and SVG DOM are similar enough that some things work, but dissimilar enough that lots of others don't.
[14:56:55] <t-ask> Do I have to accces them as childs of the svg object id then?
[14:57:31] <robertmaxrees> you need a plugin to do it right.
[14:57:36] <t-ask> I guess, it depends on how I implement the svg, or?
[14:57:47] <t-ask> you know whic one?
[14:58:30] <robertmaxrees> no.  i'd search google and see what your options are.
[14:58:59] <t-ask> google isn't very helpful concerning SVG coding...well ok I use ddg
[14:59:16] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+svg&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
[14:59:29] <robertmaxrees> https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jquery+svg&ia=qa
[15:00:00] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, just do it natively.
[15:00:17] <t-ask> robertmaxrees: thank you. I'm just a bit curious because I searched the last two days for a solution to do it nativly
[15:00:29] <t-ask> so got to jquery 1h ago .)
[15:01:37] <t-ask> I guess, I search for the plugin to keep everything at one place
[15:02:00] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need jquery for anything else, i wouldn't use it.
[15:02:07] <robertmaxrees> dani
[15:02:12] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.
[15:03:48] <t-ask> I guess, jquery is ok for me, cause I want to design a small webapp like page with certain UI objects
[15:04:30] <robertmaxrees> okay.  just don't expect magic with SVGs ;)
[15:05:00] <t-ask> no no, I'm new to web development and I just want to do very basic stuff
[15:05:57] <t-ask> someone recommended D3js... then I got the download and it was 3mb huge .... :)
[15:06:20] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you need to do, that might be the right tool
[15:06:34] <t-ask> so I thought: come on, you are new, keep it simple :)
[15:07:48] <t-ask> I don't need any SVG animations eg. therefore, I think jquery plugin is ok for basic stuff like changing text date
[15:07:58] <t-ask> s/date/data
[15:08:07] <robertmaxrees> you should probably just use native JS for that, but OK
[15:10:21] <t-ask> I tried to find exactly this. Most of the examples weren't written in a way for <object> implemntation. Most of them were inline (stripped) and I as I said I'm fairly new to this.
[15:11:18] <t-ask> currently I'm working myself through the JS tutorial as codecademy .)
[15:11:35] <t-ask> and they use jquery *gg
[15:12:28] <t-ask> I guess, this is so probably so basic, that no one writes an SVG example because the implementation is as with normal DOM
[15:12:39] <robertmaxrees> it's not the same as normal DOM.
[15:12:44] <robertmaxrees> i just said that it's different.
[15:12:54] <t-ask> s/is as/is so basic as
[15:15:45] <t-ask> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2753732/how-to-access-svg-elements-with-javascript this looks like an example I could try
[15:20:36] <t-ask> robertmaxrees: I know, there is a lot to learn ahead! I'm just searching for 'full working' examples at the moment, because then I know, it's me if an example is not working and I can learn how to do it right.
[15:21:00] <t-ask> I found a page which lists 5+ ways of how to implement SVGs .)
[15:21:39] <t-ask> that's definitely not what I need currently :)
[15:24:50] <t-ask> and why do I need SVG? Cause I want to print out the results with reliable scaling while the use can manipulate the size beforehand. I thought of <canvas>, too
[15:25:11] <t-ask> /s/use/user
[15:26:03] <robertmaxrees> like on a printer?
[15:26:14] <t-ask> yes laser printer
[15:26:22] <robertmaxrees> then all bets are basically off.
[15:26:25] <robertmaxrees> you can't really control that.
[15:26:53] <t-ask> with svg I should do, or?
[15:27:02] <robertmaxrees> you can't at all reliably.
[15:27:05] <t-ask> I mean a test print was looking fine
[15:27:08] <robertmaxrees> too many variables between the page and the printer.
[15:27:40] <t-ask> oh, you mean if I use more than one SVG
[15:27:46] <robertmaxrees> no
[15:27:54] <t-ask> becasue of how objects flow
[15:28:16] <robertmaxrees> i mean period.  there's no sane, simple, easy way to reliably print things from the internet.
[15:28:27] <t-ask> im may case it doesn't matter, only the size of each SVG is importent
[15:31:49] <FrankD_> Hi, I'm using jQueryUI Tabs, and I have two "windows" with tabs in them, I want to be able to drag the tabs from one window to another
[15:31:56] <FrankD_> but doing so results in some funky behavior
[15:32:00] <FrankD_> is there a proper way to do this?
[15:33:57] <FrankD_> detaching/appending the content goes fine
[15:34:02] <FrankD_> and moving the tab itself graphically works
[15:34:13] <FrankD_> but it results in some funky interactions between "tabbar1" and "tabbar2" when you click on tabs
[16:10:59] <igyiguygyu> Has anyone experienced laggy animation using jQuery(window).load(function()?
[16:11:45] <igyiguygyu> I have animated preloaded div while the script loads up the images in site. However, it's not smooth (the animation runs smoothly on its own)
[16:13:25] <igyiguygyu> can't really reproduce on jsfiddle, but here's how i have it setup - https://jsfiddle.net/dd6py4qp/
[16:17:59] <igyiguygyu> Is this a common problem for jQuery(window).load(function()?
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> not that i've seen.
[16:21:14] <igyiguygyu> http://hildiweiman.com/
[16:21:31] <igyiguygyu> here, you'll see at the beginning. tried different browsers - same thing
[16:21:31] <robertmaxrees> seems fine here.
[16:22:22] <igyiguygyu> if you compare it with the one on jsfiddle, its like 2fps vs 60fps
[16:22:33] <robertmaxrees> smooth as butter on my machine.
[16:22:35] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're seeing.
[16:23:10] <igyiguygyu> huh, hows that possible
[16:24:00] <igyiguygyu> hmm seems to be working fine only on firefox, not on safari/chrome
[16:24:19] <igyiguygyu> however that's not css problem as on its own its smooth on chrome/safari too
[16:24:47] <robertmaxrees> oh it's probably all the code running on pageload/document ready vs the preloader.
[16:25:42] <igyiguygyu> how to avoid that?
[16:25:49] <igyiguygyu> tbh fix that
[16:54:18] <poppiesty> what  do I need to join this conversation
[16:54:37] <robertmaxrees> join what conversation?>
[16:55:04] <poppiesty> good question, clever. lol
[16:55:16] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:55:29] <poppiesty> I just hate inactivity
[16:55:43] <robertmaxrees> ah
[17:48:03] <Prometheian> Can I do something like var xhr = $.ajax(); and then later do xhr({}) and have it do what I want?
[18:04:11] <jqueryius> hello
[18:04:31] <jqueryius> At http://www.bootstrap-switch.org/examples.html - how can I find out what javascript/jquery function is being called when you click "TOGGLE" under Indeterminate
[18:04:48] <jqueryius> All it says in the source is: <button type="button" data-switch-toggle="indeterminate" class="btn btn-default">Toggle</button>
[18:04:54] <jqueryius> how do I know which event gets fired?
[18:16:36] <HorizonXP> hey guys, I have a $.get function that's retrieving JSON from my server, however, the server is returning it in pages of 10 results each... how can I "loop" the requests to get all the pages I want?
[18:17:24] <HorizonXP> https://gist.github.com/HorizonXP/63bebf5e25aecb312e5d <-- this is what I'm trying to do now
[18:17:45] <HorizonXP> but of course, the while loop is outside the asynchronous result function, so this doesn't work
[18:21:12] <HorizonXP> maybe I can do a recursive function
[18:41:54] <jqueryius> In jquery how can I make the page start at a certain point
[18:42:03] <jqueryius> ie. i pick an ID and that ID is at the top of the page
[18:44:16] <kevireilly_> jqueryius: would you like it to jump or animate?
[18:44:32] <jqueryius> neither, I just want it to go there instantly
[18:45:01] <Woet> so why are you not using anchors?
[18:45:05] <Woet> no need for javascript or jquery
[18:54:18] <acidjazz> NO NEED
[19:02:51] <gadget-girl> having issue with .on

[19:03:54] <gadget-girl> why does this not work
[19:05:41] <rcyr> You could start by using a real id
[19:06:00] <rcyr> Then if it's still doesn't work... then write a testcase on jsfiddle.net
[19:06:06] <rcyr> and give us the link
[19:26:15] <hellier> any help? :( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29528658/how-to-prevent-focusout-when-focusin-fires-on-the-same-element

[19:52:14] <errJS> and if so, can you invite me?
[20:06:27] <jqueryius> Hi guys, is it possible to totally remove an attribute?
[20:06:36] <jqueryius> ie. <input.... value="">
[20:06:42] <jqueryius> if I do removeAttr('value')
[20:06:46] <jqueryius> then I get left with value
[20:06:49] <jqueryius> not value=""
[20:06:55] <jqueryius> how do i get rid of value too
[20:15:15] <jqueryius> Is it possible to have a selector, and then "Except" a certain ID?
[20:19:41] <spillere> im building a progress bar for a project where it sends many $.post in a for loop. How can I wait for the response of the post to go to the next loop?
[20:21:40] <spillere> maybe ajax async false?
[20:22:48] <jqueryius> spillere: I did that exact same thing a few days ago
[20:23:07] <spillere> jqueryius: did it work? :)
[20:23:13] <jqueryius> yep, i'll explain
[20:23:25] <jqueryius> firstly, yes use $.ajax
[20:23:43] <jqueryius> I had a counter for all of the items I wanted to send and stored the items in an array
[20:23:58] <jqueryius> I put the ajax inside  function called sendToWebService
[20:24:14] <jqueryius> then on the success call of the ajax, I call the function but increase the counter
[20:24:28] <spillere> yeah
[20:24:35] <jqueryius> before I make the functional call I update the progress bar
[20:25:00] <jqueryius> $('#progress-bar').attr('aria-valuenow', percentage); $('#progress-bar').width(percentage + '%'); $('#progress-bar').text(percentage + '% (' + count + '/' + total + ')');
[20:25:02] <jqueryius> like that
[20:26:08] <spillere> http://pastie.org/10081646 shoudlnt this be right?!
[20:26:48] <jqueryius> i did it a bit differently
[20:26:55] <spillere> how was your call?
[20:27:46] <jqueryius> http://pastie.org/private/n3nzt0hw6jmzgowlflhm3q
[20:28:11] <jqueryius> i'm not saying yours is wrong, but the way I did works for me
[20:28:27] <spillere> yeah, thanks
[20:28:35] <jqueryius> don't quote me on this, but i think there might be a difference between done and success
[20:31:55] <spillere> can't get this async to work, maybe old jQuery?
[20:32:19] <spillere> nope
[20:37:43] <jqueryius> is there an error?
[20:38:56] <spillere> no its fine, i was using .ajax wrong
[20:43:11] <jqueryius> I'm running: $('#questions-form')[0].reset();  ......... and i'm finding I have drop down boxes which might say 1,2,3,4,5,6 as options... but after the reset, the select box shows an empty option
[20:43:15] <jqueryius> even though there is no empty option
[20:43:18] <jqueryius> I don't understand
[20:45:50] <Guest77896> I have a quick question about navbar in dialogs
[20:46:58] <Guest77896> the navbar at the bottom is bigger than the  dialog
[20:47:34] <Guest77896> looks like the navbar doesn't inherent the css properties of the dialog parent
[20:48:13] <Guest77896> how can I make fit a footer navbar inside a dialog page?
[21:32:55] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can help me with this? - http://pastebin.com/L0DGtwU3 - The canvas is there, but the pie chart isn't display.
[21:33:54] <Uhkis> !demo @ Forbidd3n
[21:33:54] <b-ot> Forbidd3n: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:34:23] <Forbidd3n> Uhkis: well the demo won't be able to pull the json since it is local
[21:34:39] <Forbidd3n> I gave the js and I gave the json returned - there is nothing more to the code
[21:34:49] <Forbidd3n> and there are no js errors in firebug
[21:35:05] <Forbidd3n> also I do console.log on the returned json string and it is there
[21:35:12] <Forbidd3n> just not plotting it
[21:35:21] <Forbidd3n> or showing the pie chart at all
[21:49:11] <Forbidd3n> anyone?
[22:05:34] <jqueryius> Hi guys
[22:05:36] <jqueryius> easy question
[22:05:41] <jqueryius> $('#start :input').each(function () {
[22:05:52] <jqueryius> how can I make it ignore any inputs of type=checkbox?
[22:06:11] <jqueryius> I  tried $('#start :input :not([type=checkbox])')
[22:06:15] <jqueryius> but that did not work
[22:06:20] <Uhkis> ?api not @ jqueryius
[22:06:20] <b-ot> jqueryius: .not(): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[22:06:37] <jqueryius> I did try that
[22:07:01] <jqueryius> it ended up stripping out everything that wasn't of type "option" for some reason
[22:07:07] <jqueryius> I just want to strip out checkboxes
[22:08:58] <jqueryius> ahh
[22:09:06] <Uhkis> jqueryius: http://jsfiddle.net/6z1ur5t3/ works fine
[22:09:08] <jqueryius> i had a space between :input and :not
[22:09:43] <jqueryius> is there any advantage to your way compared to $('#start :input:not([type="checkbox"])')  ??
[22:10:12] <jqueryius> and what is the difference between having :input and (as you did) just input
[22:11:15] <Uhkis> input is faster
[22:11:37] <Uhkis> "Because :input is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using :input cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM querySelectorAll() method"
[22:12:58] <jqueryius> ok
[22:13:17] <jqueryius> so i should use $('#start input:not([type="checkbox"])')   ?
[22:13:25] <jqueryius> or should i use .not() like you had?
[22:13:39] <Felishia> is there a jquery way to select all a elements inside a div?
[22:13:47] <Felishia> even those a that are inside another a's
[22:14:25] <Uhkis> jqueryius: if pasting from jsfiddle would work normally, i would've said that's probably the fastest way :)
[22:15:09] <jqueryius> ok :)
[22:15:13] <jqueryius> thanks i'll use yours
[22:15:20] <Felishia> no wait there is... it's jstree that is kidding me
[22:15:37] <Uhkis> Felishia: children('a') should work
[22:15:56] <Felishia> does anyone know jstree?
[22:15:58] <Uhkis> jqueryius: $('#start input:not([type="checkbox"])') should be the fastest
[22:16:14] <Felishia> is there a way to set different icons for leaf?
[22:16:28] <jqueryius> oh ok
[22:17:44] <Uhkis> Felishia: css?
[22:17:58] <Felishia> no...
[22:18:09] <Felishia> well yes, but that shouldn't be the way
[22:18:14] <Felishia> feels like a hack
[22:18:14] <Felishia> meh
[22:19:05] <Uhkis> css is a hack now? lol
[22:20:16] <Felishia> no, css is for setting styles to the document, but they're not really designed for these situations
[22:20:31] <Felishia> well it works
[22:20:40] <Felishia> but meh... my code looks ugly now
[22:21:46] <Uhkis> and you don't consider changing the style changing the style?
[22:22:16] <jqueryius> has anyone here used bootstrap-switch?
[22:22:35] <Felishia> I know, but it's a tree structure, I should be able to set html attributes if I wanted to
[22:23:05] <jqueryius> i'm trying to understand: http://www.bootstrap-switch.org/methods.html
[22:23:19] <jqueryius> how would I call toggleIndeterminate() ?
[22:24:24] <jqueryius> basically, I just want to with jquery when someone performs some action, rest the switch to indeterminate state
[22:24:30] <jqueryius> just like if you clicked the toggle button at http://www.bootstrap-switch.org/examples.html
[22:25:37] <Uhkis> $('yourelement').on('something', function() {Â $(this).toggleIndeterminate(); }); ?
[22:25:58] <Uhkis> oops
[22:26:17] <Uhkis> $(this).bootstrapSwitch('toggleIndeterminate', true);
[22:26:32] <jqueryius> let me try, thanks
[22:27:47] <jqueryius> you are a genius Uhkis :)
[22:34:33] <hellier> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29530521/hiding-an-element-when-clicking-anywhere-without-checking-every-dom-click
[22:37:16] <jqueryius> Uhkis, are you familiar with switchChange.bootstrapSwitch? http://www.bootstrap-switch.org/events.html -- I did what you suggested with the toggleIndeterminate above. What I am finding is that after  I programatically set it back to the indeterminate state, the next time someone changes the switch the event doesn't pick it up immediately (if they change the switch again, then it picks it up)
[22:37:33] <jqueryius> I assume maybe before i toggleIndeterminate I need to clear the state somehow?
[22:39:29] <jqueryius> yes... because if I leave them all in the On state --- then make them indeterminate --- then move them to the Off state, the event fires. But if I move it to the On state again, it doesn't fire - I guess because that was its last known state, so it's like nothing has changed?
[22:40:49] <Uhkis> $(yourelement).prop('checked', false); should reset the state
[22:41:15] <jqueryius> let me try
[22:43:04] <jqueryius> hmm, unfortunately not :(
[22:43:44] <Uhkis> make a fiddle
[22:44:27] <hellier> http://jsbin.com/teyijotuyo/1/edit - how would you close a DIV when clicking anywhere, but without adding an event to every DOM click?
[22:45:34] <jqueryius> ok
[22:46:06] <jqueryius> can I upload external resources into jsfiddle (the switch library)?
[22:46:24] <Uhkis> jqueryius: external resources on the left menu
[22:46:55] <jqueryius> yeah, can they be uploaded from pc though
[22:47:10] <jqueryius> i don't know if the bootstrap-switch library has a cdn
[22:48:00] <Uhkis> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/master/dist/js/bootstrap-switch.min.js should work
[22:48:02] <jqueryius> ah never mind, maybe I can hijack someone elses :) http://jsfiddle.net/KyleMit/VTv2j/
[22:52:15] <jqueryius> sorry it's taking me a while to set up
[22:52:45] <jqueryius> ok done
[22:52:46] <jqueryius> http://jsfiddle.net/VTv2j/71/
[22:52:55] <jqueryius> 1. Slide it to Yes
[22:53:01] <jqueryius> 2. Click reset
[22:53:11] <jqueryius> --- it should go back to indeterminate using your earlier code now ---
[22:53:19] <jqueryius> 3. Slide it to Yes
[22:53:26] <jqueryius> --- No event is triggered ---
[22:53:33] <Uhkis> please never use alerts again, console.log() next time
[22:53:48] <jqueryius> if you do the same thing, except with step 3 slide to "No" it will be triggered
[22:53:50] <jqueryius> ok
[22:55:34] <Uhkis> it's working perfectly fine here
[22:56:48] <jqueryius> are you sliding it with the mouse?
[22:57:14] <jqueryius> weirdly i think it depends on where you start sliding it from
[22:58:00] <jqueryius> i think if you just firm click it, it's okay
[22:58:07] <jqueryius> but if you slide it into position it doesn't work?
[22:59:02] <Uhkis> ok, sliding makes it work really weirdly
[22:59:38] <jqueryius> because I'm doing this primary for mobile phone, the slide is quite important because thats what people instinctively do
[23:00:10] <jqueryius> but the thing is, it 95% works... it's just that annoying situation where after a reset it plays up --- I need a reset button so people can quickly clear all their options if they need to
[23:00:24] <jqueryius> before a reset, it works perfectly - no issues with the event handling at all
[23:01:23] <jqueryius> http://jsfiddle.net/VTv2j/71/   -> I've used console.log now
[23:02:55] <jqueryius> is there any other jquery magic I could use besides switchChange.bootstrapSwitch? Because technically, I don't care what state they select. All I need to know is when it's no longer indeterminate (reason is, when it's no longer indeterminate - I .show() the next option)
[23:03:08] <jqueryius> I've only been using switchChange.bootstrapSwitch because it's worked thus far
[23:03:29] <jqueryius> but if there's some jquery magic which can also detect that it's gone from indeterminate to *something* then that would work fine
[23:08:03] <Uhkis> well that plugin is not playing noce at all
[23:08:08] <Uhkis> nice*
[23:08:56] <Uhkis> why not what just regular radiobuttons?
[23:09:23] <jqueryius> there's a certain look that needs to be followed
[23:10:21] <jqueryius> the plugin works pretty well overall, it's just this problem after the fields are reset that's the issue. I think perhaps there is "no state" on the initial page load, so the fields are indeterminate - and any change is registered as a change of state
[23:10:29] <jqueryius> but running $('input[name=' + element.name + ']').bootstrapSwitch('toggleIndeterminate', true);
[23:10:35] <jqueryius> makes it look indeterminate
[23:10:42] <jqueryius> but doesn't remove the last state
[23:10:46] <jqueryius> thats my theory
[23:12:02] <jqueryius> $('input[name="my-checkbox"]').bootstrapSwitch('state', true, true);     ........... might try setting it to null?
[23:12:17] <jqueryius> i'm not sure what the third param is for though
[23:22:51] <jqueryius> Uhkis... maybe a breakthrough? See what I've done here... http://jsfiddle.net/VTv2j/75/              --- i've "destroyed" the instance, then re-created it. is there anything you can see there which would explain why no events are being triggered any more?
[23:23:10] <jqueryius> I feel like nothing happening at all is almost a better result than something happen some of the time
[23:33:16] <Uhkis> jqueryius: removing the element also removes the handler from it, you have to rebind it after destroying
[23:33:37] <jqueryius> with more than just $('input[name=test]').bootstrapSwitch(); ?
[23:34:44] <Uhkis> jqueryius: http://jsfiddle.net/VTv2j/77/
[23:35:23] <jqueryius> Uhkis
[23:35:29] <jqueryius> that looks to me like you've solved it!
[23:36:12] <jqueryius> thanks so much
[23:36:17] <Uhkis> np
[23:36:33] <jqueryius> if you use StackOverflow and want some points, I put the question up a few minutes ago: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29531394/reset-bootstrap-switch-state
[23:37:22] <jqueryius> wow, it's a relief to have that working
[23:39:34] <Uhkis> :-)
[23:49:00] <hellier> i'm wanting to add an event handler to the body when .unitwrap has an .active class, and remove that event handler when .active is removed.
[23:49:04] <hellier> http://jsbin.com/wigitapebi/1/edit?js,console,output
[23:49:07] <hellier> any idea?
[23:50:12] <Cork> hellier: you need to include the delegation selector
[23:50:43] <hellier> Hmmph, gonna have to google that lol
[23:51:00] <Cork> hellier: though the code is weird
[23:51:05] <Kartagis> "search%2Fnode%2Ffelsefi denemeler birlikte".replace(/%2F/g,'/').replace(/ /g,'+') <--- this works very well in the console but it doesn't on my web page. any ideas?
[23:51:11] <Cork> hellier: this won't ever be body
[23:51:18] <Cork> so that section won't ever happen
[23:51:30] <hellier> delegate is the same as on though?
[23:51:37] <Cork> no
[23:51:37] <hellier> .delegate .on
[23:51:52] <Cork> on is a combination handler it is that same as .bind AND .delegate
[23:51:59] <Cork> depending on what arguments you give it
[23:52:13] <hellier> hmmph
[23:53:21] <Cork> hellier: s the first line is .delegate but the first if case expects .bind and the last if case expects .delegate
[23:53:28] <Cork> so ya, it is a big confused :)
[23:53:35] <Cork> *bit
[23:55:30] <hellier> http://jsbin.com/wuqokohico/1/edit?js,console,output like that?
[23:58:47] <Uhkis> man that jsbin is horrible to use
[23:59:10] <hellier> :(
[23:59:29] <Cork> ya, sadly so is jsfiddle in many cases now days
