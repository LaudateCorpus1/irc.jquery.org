[08:54:39] <pokmo> can a function with 6 arguments be called using 4?
[09:02:32] <pavonia> Yes
[09:36:25] <xebra> hi, I don't understand this line: $slides = $('<div>', { "class": 'slides' })
[09:36:54] <xebra> it looks like a selector, but I've never seen a selector like that
[09:48:55] <pavonia> xebra: It creates a new div element with the given class attribute
[09:59:15] <xebra> pavonia, whoa, I didn't even know that. It's just I couldn't find it in the docs (not under DOM manipulation, etc.). Now I see it's documented under "core". Thanks

[12:54:54] <lordl> Hello guys! DOMNodeRemoved triggers even if jQuery replace content in a div. What can I do?
[13:08:48] <nalo> Hi, I am trying to disable scrolling for body but it also disables it for div boxes inside, any ideas ?
[13:24:38] <nalo> hello ?
[13:35:25] <nalo> anyone ?
[13:55:06] <fas3r> Hello, I'm trying to use history.pushState and onpopstate event when using back button. It's working however I have a small issue, I need to click twice on the button back to go to the previous page. https://pastebin.com/Hgu53KjY. THanks by advance.
[15:50:00] <jak2020> other question: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/aLft3Lez/   how to change the value o the next input text? in this case if user input in the row 1000: type 3 (input.id=x1000) i want multiply 1000*3 and store the result in the input.xy1000 how to?
[15:57:19] <jak2020> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/aLft3Lez/1/  updated my fiddle but not work
[16:27:34] <Al_nz1> how is it that when I go to portal.microsoftonline.com I can see a input tag in the DOM (for login) but nothing in the source? I am inspecting in chrome
[16:40:22] <shoky_> Al_nz1: because it is only added to the DOM after the page has loaded
[16:40:40] <shoky_> not everything in the DOM was there to begin with :p
[16:41:22] <Al_nz1> shoky_: hmmm, there goes my plan of getting OKHttp librayr to login to the wepage with java
[16:43:00] <shoky_> better to use an actual API for that, probably
[16:43:40] <shoky_> assuming there is one, for whatever data you're trying to pull out
[16:46:19] <xebra> hi, jquery plugins have default options set to something, usually. I'm wondering, if you have a numeric option that should not be set by default, what should it be set to?
[16:46:48] <xebra> Example: {play: false, animation_speed: ??? null? undefined? false? }
[16:46:50] <shoky_> xebra:  undefined?
[16:47:40] <xebra> although that's a bad example, because in that case it would make sense to set animation_speed to 0 for "no animation"
[16:47:45] <Al_nz1> shoky_: like an API provided by the website?
[16:47:49] <Al_nz1> I dont know if there is one
[16:47:51] <Al_nz1> its azure
[16:47:53] <shoky_> yes
[16:48:01] <shoky_> i'm sure azure has tons of API's ;)
[16:48:06] <Al_nz1> with a custom webapp behind it
[16:48:08] <Al_nz1> hmm
[16:48:16] <shoky_> as for a custom webapp, who knows.
[16:48:39] <Al_nz1> shoky_: I could use the azure api for the login, then deal with the webapp after that
[16:49:14] <shoky_> maybe.. donno what this webapp is or allows
[16:51:19] <jak2020> other question: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/aLft3Lez/1/   how to change the value o the next input text? in this case if user input in the row 1000: type 3 (input.id=x1000) i want multiply 1000*3 and store the result in the input.xy1000 how to?
[16:51:28] <Al_nz1> well the web app has no api - but its written rather simple
[18:09:06] <fas3r> Hello, I'm trying to use history.pushState and onpopstate event when using back button. It's working however I have a small issue, I need to click twice on the button back to go to the previous page. https://pastebin.com/Hgu53KjY. THanks by advance.
[18:42:48] <jak2000> shoky_?
[18:51:35] <shoky_> jak2000: what's the problem?
[18:51:53] <shoky_> i don't want to write your code for you
[18:53:42] <jak2000> any advice
[18:53:42] <jak2000> teach me
[18:54:16] <jak2000> not do my code...
[18:54:16] <jak2000> see: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/z4xbf104/
[18:54:16] <jak2000> i want modify the next input... i do prev() next() closest but not work
[18:54:30] <shoky_> you get the value with .val(),  you get the multiplier with .data('valor'),  you multiply with *
[18:54:42] <shoky_> prev() gets the direct previous sibling
[18:54:49] <shoky_> your <input> has no siblings
[18:55:05] <shoky_> it is the only child in its parent <div>
[18:55:19] <jak2000> how to understand?
[18:55:20] <shoky_> so traverse the DOM. e.g. with .parent()
[18:56:57] <shoky_> .parent().next().find('input')  will get the <input> inside the next <div> after the parent
[19:03:24] <jak2000> ok understanding...
[19:03:32] <jak2000> <div></div> is a box right?
[19:06:29] <jak2000> shoky_ done: wthis.parent().next().find('input').val('saaa');
[19:06:35] <jak2000> unerstand
[19:12:07] <jak2000> shoky_ can you tell me how to understand the dom?
[19:13:06] <jak2000> recommend me a link
[19:15:30] <grapheti> jak2000: https://css-tricks.com/dom/
[19:15:42] <jak2000> ok thanks
[19:15:44] <jak2000> reading
[19:15:48] <grapheti> You must be one with the dom.
[19:17:12] <jak2000> ok
[19:17:37] <jak2000> i want learn about this: this.parent().next().find('input').val('saaa');
[19:18:19] <grapheti> Sounds like a bunch of https://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif to me
[19:20:02] <jak2000> ok thanks
[19:20:03] <jak2000> :)
[19:20:08] <jak2000> want a beer?
[19:20:20] <grapheti> yum beer!
[19:21:17] <grapheti> Say, what would you think parent() means to you?
[19:36:56] <jak2000> see: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/z4xbf104/
[19:40:44] <grapheti> I thought you're trying to figure out what this.parent().next().find('input').val('saaa'); is
[19:40:50] <jak2000> yes
[19:40:54] <jak2000> i think:
[19:40:57] <grapheti> So what is parent()
[19:42:03] <jak2000> <div id='div1'> <input type='text' /> </div> <div id='div2'> <input type='text' /> </div>   parent is go out the div right?
[19:42:47] <grapheti> console.log() it and see what it returns
[19:49:21] <jak2000> console.log($("#div1").parent());   ?
[19:50:10] <grapheti> Is #div1 in your HTML?
[20:02:35] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/haq60s7j/
[20:02:49] <jak2000> [body, prevObject: init(1), context: document, selector: "#div2.parent()"]
[20:02:52] <jak2000> not understand
[20:03:53] <grapheti> You may not understand now, but don't worry about that. It's tell us information.
[20:03:57] <grapheti> This is good.
[20:05:21] <grapheti> what's the first thing in that array.
[20:06:06] <grapheti> It's telling us information*
[20:06:33] <grapheti> So what's the first thing in that array?
[20:08:35] <jak2000> i see some values
[20:08:53] <jak2000> cclick at the left arrow: [body, prevObject: init(1), context: document, selector: "#div2.parent()"]
[20:09:31] <grapheti> What's the first one.
[20:09:41] <jak2000> 0: body
[20:10:14] <grapheti> Right, this means that body is the parent of $('#div2')
[20:10:22] <grapheti> So it's going up.
[20:10:56] <grapheti> Now let's add .next() and see what that is doing.
[20:12:01] <jak2000> you tell me: console.log($("#div2").parent().next());     ?
[20:12:20] <jak2000> i see: [style#stylish-5.stylish, prevObject: init(1), context: document, selector: "#div2.parent().next()"]
[20:13:30] <grapheti> so it's going up to body then going to the next element
[20:13:42] <grapheti> that doesn't really help us, right?
[20:14:46] <grapheti> The example you have has containers. So we can go up those.
[20:14:59] <grapheti> There's no much we can do at the top of the tree in body.
[20:15:09] <jak2000> the first:
[20:15:11] <jak2000> 0: style#stylish-5.stylish
[20:15:18] <grapheti> I don't get that.
[20:15:33] <grapheti> Not sure why you are.
[20:16:14] <jak2000> see:
[20:16:14] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/haq60s7j/1/
[20:16:18] <grapheti> I get [document, selector: "#div2.parent().next()"]
[20:17:09] <jak2000> [prevObject: init(1), context: document, selector: "#div2.parent().next()"]
[20:17:11] <grapheti> jak2000: see http://recordit.co/GA4RpdcV6T
[20:17:25] <jak2000> okay
[20:17:44] <grapheti> it basically means we're going up to body
[20:17:52] <grapheti> and the next element is html
[20:17:59] <grapheti> so it's going to that
[20:18:04] <grapheti> So now we know what it's doing
[20:18:15] <grapheti> .parent() is going up an element
[20:18:21] <grapheti> .next() is going to the next element
[20:19:38] <grapheti> Think you can figure out the rest on the list?
[20:19:41] <jak2000> wait ammoment
[20:19:44] <jak2000> a moment
[20:20:18] <jak2000> context: document
[20:21:00] <grapheti> yes
[20:21:23] <grapheti> we can console.log(document) to see what this is
[20:21:23] <jak2000> how to check: <grapheti> and the next element is html
[20:21:39] <grapheti> let's console.log() it
[20:21:43] <grapheti> see what we find
[20:22:20] <jak2000> ooo see:
[20:22:25] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/haq60s7j/3/
[20:22:45] <grapheti> right, I see <html></html>
[20:22:56] <jak2000> where console.log(document); tell me:  <html></html>
[20:22:57] <jak2000> ok
[20:23:22] <jak2000> we are here:
[20:23:33] <jak2000>  wthis.parent().next().find('input').val('saaa');
[20:23:46] <grapheti> so what's that doing
[20:23:51] <jak2000> mmmm not understand why: find
[20:24:02] <grapheti> console.log() it
[20:24:05] <grapheti> see what it does
[20:24:13] <jak2000> if i am on html.... find('input). can get much inputs right?
[20:24:26] <grapheti> let's see
[20:24:32] <grapheti> console.log() it
[20:25:19] <jak2000> console.log($(this).parent().next().find('input').val('saaa'));  ?
[20:25:33] <jak2000> see: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/haq60s7j/4/
[20:25:52] <jak2000> conext: undefined
[20:26:12] <grapheti> undefined means we didn't do something right
[20:26:23] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/haq60s7j/6/
[20:26:40] <jak2000> error
[20:27:20] <grapheti> click on the error
[20:27:25] <grapheti> what does it tell you
[20:28:18] <grapheti> Unexpected token usually means you didn't type the right snytax
[20:28:53] <jak2000> yes
[20:28:57] <jak2000> better: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/z4xbf104/5/
[20:29:23] <grapheti> So did you figure out your problem?
[20:29:39] <jak2000> yes
[20:29:44] <grapheti> :)
[20:29:45] <jak2000> much thanks
[20:29:49] <jak2000> i understand
[20:29:50] <jak2000> prev()
[20:29:51] <grapheti> always use console.log() my friend
[20:29:52] <jak2000> next()
[20:30:01] <jak2000> grapheti yes,, and thanks
[20:30:03] <grapheti> Let the computer tell you things.
[20:30:08] <grapheti> And figure them out.
[20:30:09] <jak2000> what about silbings? nearest ...?
[20:30:16] <grapheti> console.log it
[20:30:22] <grapheti> play around with it
[20:30:25] <grapheti> see what it does
[20:30:39] <grapheti> you've already mastered two
[20:30:58] <grapheti> .parent() and .next()
[20:31:02] <grapheti> well, three .prev()
[20:31:20] <grapheti> Keep setting up examples and figure it out.
[20:31:57] <jak2000> ok thanks
[20:31:58] <jak2000> again
[20:32:08] <grapheti> np :D
[20:33:27] <grapheti> jak2000: start with jquery examples and copy/paste them into jsfiddle and console.log them
[20:33:38] <grapheti> so you know where to start
[20:34:22] <grapheti> like go here: https://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[20:34:29] <jak2000> ok yes
[20:34:33] <grapheti> and copy that <ul> list and that jquery code into jsfiddle
[20:35:01] <grapheti> and play with it
[20:35:30] <jak2000> :)
[20:35:37] <jak2000> where are you from?
[20:35:51] <jak2000> console.log('escuse  me');
[20:35:56] <grapheti> The worst state in the US. Oklahoma.
[20:55:59] <jak2000> mexico.
[20:56:01] <jak2000> thanks
[20:56:26] <grapheti> I'd rather be in Mexico. I hear it's beautiful.
