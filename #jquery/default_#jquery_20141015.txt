[00:26:04] <jaggz-> where do I get the .css from for styling an accordion?  (enabled icons but I don't see them.. ) http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-icons
[00:26:31] <jaggz-> I'm testing with just the header icons right now: $(function() { $( "#events_recent" ).accordion( { collapsible: true, header: "ui-icon-triangle-1-e" } ); });
[00:27:14] <Cork> jaggz-: http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[00:27:19] <Cork> the theme section
[00:28:00] <jaggz-> can I just have two arrows without a whole theme?
[00:28:16] <Cork> you could copy the parts you want
[00:28:30] <Cork> but the styling and is in those files
[00:28:37] <Cork> so you would have to start with that
[00:28:56] <jaggz-> thanks
[00:29:12] <jaggz-> yeah it says, if icons is enabled (did I pass my options right?) you get "ui-accordion-icons"
[00:32:36] <jaggz-> looks like a bunch is involved :)
[00:34:49] <Cork> jaggz-: well you need the icons png file
[00:35:01] <Cork> and the classes needed for that
[00:35:02] <Unopoo> I remember I see from somewhere that jquery make selection in current selection in one situation, and make selection in the whole document in another situation, but I can't recall what exactly it said, can you guys give me a hint?
[00:35:07] <Cork> should be basically all you need
[00:35:36] <Cork> Unopoo: object.find()
[00:35:50] <Cork> is the one that is easier to erad
[00:35:52] <Cork> *read
[00:36:03] <jaggz-> is there a way to just put a unicode letter at the left side?
[00:36:07] <Cork> there is a shorthand where you do $('selector', object)
[00:36:20] <Cork> jaggz-: its css
[00:36:25] <Cork> sure you can
[00:36:25] <Unopoo> Cork: thx
[00:36:26] <jaggz-> k
[00:45:32] <Unopoo> I have a form.add which contain an input and a texteare, I want to get their's value, currently I'm in the selectin of this form.add, so `$(this).find("input").val();` works well, but `$(this).find("textarea").val();` can't get what I want, any idea?
[00:45:54] <Unopoo> okay, I know , just a typo
[00:46:36] <Cork> inside form.add??
[00:46:41] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[00:49:07] <guy> anyone have examples of jQuery plugins documented using JSDoc?
[01:11:21] <hirsty> Hey all, currently using zebra datepicker, on destroy this seems to be leaving spans everywhere, whats the best method of cleaning this up?
[01:15:04] <caraconan> Hi there. There's a way to implement a custom asyn function?
[01:15:28] <caraconan> Case use is to implement a counter, that alerts when 60 seconds has passed
[01:15:42] <caraconan> Obviously this will not be the final case, I need just to test
[01:15:43] <caraconan> Thanks
[01:18:20] <caraconan> Nobody?
[01:18:27] <Cork> caraconan: look at requestAnimationFrame
[01:18:36] <Cork> ?mdn requestAnimationFrame
[01:18:45] <Cork> <_<
[01:18:48] <Cork> ?g mdn requestAnimationFrame
[01:18:57] <Cork> ah... the bot is dead...
[01:19:12] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame
[01:19:36] <caraconan> Cork: but I can't just implement myFunction() then call it in an "async way"?
[01:20:05] <Cork> caraconan: "a sync way" is just call it next event loop spin
[01:20:33] <Cork> caraconan: the rawest form of that would be setTimeout
[01:20:46] <Cork> but requestAnimationFrame is a better match for what you want to do
[01:20:48] <caraconan> Cork: ok, I see that I will need to "re-use" a pre-existing method, as you stated: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9516900/how-can-i-create-an-asynchronous-function-on-javascript Thanks
[01:21:17] <Cork> caraconan: what you want is requestAnimationFrame
[01:21:28] <Cork> it doesn't need to reuse anything
[01:21:34] <caraconan> Cork: ok, I will have a look. Thanks
[01:25:42] <Cork> caraconan: http://jsfiddle.net/w8L3ajf0/
[01:26:55] <caraconan> Cork: many, many thanks, but this is too much, I just want to implement a home-made background process without having to install a plugin (developing JQM + cordova). Thanks anyway
[01:28:48] <Cork> caraconan: too much?
[01:29:32] <caraconan> Cork: let me do some tests, your code is a great starting point
[01:29:42] <gavit> is there a  proper way to dynamically create js? or at least pass dynamic data to static js?
[01:29:44] <Cork> caraconan: note it never stops
[01:29:50] <Cork> it goes to negative numbers
[01:30:02] <Cork> a simple if case at the end would solve that
[01:30:18] <caraconan> Cork: it's perfect, I will adjust the behaviour to do other things, not connected at all with DOM
[01:30:38] <caraconan> The counter was just an example, I will not use it to manipulate the DOM
[01:32:23] <Erwat> anyone familiar wtih superagent.js? i can't think of a nice way to console.log the request i'm doing
[01:32:44] <Erwat> the niceness of it is cool and all but if i have to manually recreate the string anyway then it kinda loses its point

[02:25:18] <Kartagis> mrgt: I'm getting an expected result
[02:25:53] <mrgt> Kartagis: is it working okay on the orangefox site site without flickering?
[02:26:05] <Kartagis> mrgt: try on a cms-free page
[02:27:07] <mrgt> Kartagis: so I’m guessing you get the flickering effect as well or orangefox?
[02:27:44] <Kartagis> idk what orangefox is, but I get the expected result on jsfiddle
[02:27:58] <Kartagis> you mean firefox?
[02:28:08] <Kartagis> I'm on chrome?
[02:30:42] <Kartagis> what is this orangefox?
[02:30:43] <mrgt> Kartagis: the site i’m getting the undesired flickering effect is on this website http://www.orangefoxbikes.co.uk/
[02:31:40] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/xkzcs61n/1/

[02:32:06] <nobs> any idea about my slider-spinners?
[02:32:14] <CssNoob> How many website portfolio should I have for applying as a front-end developer entry level
[02:34:02] <Kartagis> CssNoob: over 9000!
[02:34:29] <Kartagis> CssNoob: kidding aside, I think 5 of the fancy ones is okay
[02:34:50] <mrgt> Kartagis: I think most of the time it’s fine. If you watch it cycle through a few then it does the weird flicker.
[02:35:22] <Kartagis> mrgt: you mean the brands?
[02:35:47] <mrgt> Kartagis: the testimonials on the left hand side.
[02:36:02] <CssNoob> Fancy ones, but I'm just starting like entry level work?

[02:36:31] <CssNoob> But I'm still working on my portfolio though, and learning
[02:37:10] <Kartagis> mrgt: not flickering, but after each entry, it appears for a split second
[02:37:32] <Kartagis> mrgt: that is not flickering
[02:37:57] <mrgt> Kartagis:  is there anything in my code that could stop it appearing for a split second?
[02:38:47] <ThKo> Hi Omar- , how are u? Maybe you remember my problem with loading the same page with different contents…I’ve got a maybe short question…I’ve got four checkboxes on every page I load…My goal is to have IDs for checkboxes with cb_1 to cb_4 … When I reload the page, it doesn’t update the checkboxes value…When I take unique IDs for it, it runs…Do you’ve a hint? Thanks :)
[02:39:09] <Omar-> MaxSlot hi
[02:39:18] <Kartagis> mrgt: no idea sorry
[02:39:20] <Omar-> ThKo
[02:39:49] <mrgt> Kartagis: okay, thanks anyway.
[02:40:24] <Omar-> ThKo: can create a fiddle for this simple one
[02:40:39] <ThKo> et
[02:40:42] <ThKo> Yep
[02:41:59] <Omar-> ThKo and read this article which will help you understand jQM more: http://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/03/26/jquery-mobile-page-events/
[02:43:36] <Omar-> MaxSlot are you facing any issues with scoll snippet?
[02:43:45] <ThKo> Omar-: I’ll read it. http://jsfiddle.net/uuu099oe/ This is the small fiddle
[02:44:18] <MaxSlot> need scroll back
[02:44:23] <MaxSlot> to top
[02:44:39] <MaxSlot> http://jsfiddle.net/rsdpu4za/2/
[02:44:48] <Omar-> MaxSlot ok i'll check it
[02:45:00] <Omar-> ThKo you want to check or uncheck checkboxes on page load?
[02:45:18] <MaxSlot> I will be very happy
[02:46:21] <ThKo> No no, sorry…For example: I load the page and get 4 checkboxes with content „A“, „B“, „C“ and „D“…When I reload the page I have the contents „E“, „F“, „G“ and „H“ … But JQM returns the old content „A“, „B“ … etc. Maybe I’ve to disable DOM cache? What do you think?
[02:48:26] <qyrie> hi all can anyone tell how to access shadow element  using jquery
[02:48:58] <Cork> qyrie: shadow element?
[02:49:04] <Cork> whats a shadow element?
[02:49:10] <ThKo> qyrie: What do you mean? :)
[02:49:20] <qyrie> the problem i am facing is i have a video element in my html
[02:49:32] <qyrie> there is a default video play icon in the middle
[02:49:53] <qyrie> redered by the mozilla browser
[02:50:15] <qyrie> this is the shadow element
[02:50:34] <qyrie> the play icon at the center in the link below
[02:50:48] <qyrie> http://staging-p.picplaypost.com/CIb3AKubw8fVUCQRy08jrw/
[02:50:58] <qyrie> please open it in mozilla
[02:51:11] <qyrie> to see the default play icon at the center of the page
[02:51:43] <Omar-> MaxSlot http://jsfiddle.net/rsdpu4za/3/
[02:52:12] <Uhkis> mozilla browser was discontinued years ago ;-)
[02:52:44] <Cork> qyrie: the overlay is controlled though attributes on the video tag if i remember correctly
[02:52:52] <Omar-> ThKo use .html() not .append()
[02:54:58] <qyrie> Uhkis : haha
[02:55:31] <qyrie> Cork: i think the attributes are for the play options to the bottom of the video
[02:55:49] <qyrie> having contorls to play/pause full screen etc.,
[02:56:03] <Cork> qyrie: ya, trying to dig up the info i read
[02:56:09] <Cork> haven't used it in ages
[02:56:49] <Cork> qyrie: anyway shadow elements is internal to the browser
[02:56:53] <Cork> and pages can't style them
[02:57:06] <MaxSlot> Da best
[02:57:13] <Omar-> MaxSlot this is even better http://jsfiddle.net/aukyz8ap/
[02:59:33] <MaxSlot> 5 years ago i thought that mirc is only for gaming :D
[02:59:48] <Omar-> MaxSlot and files sharing ;)
[03:00:36] <Cork> qyrie: been looking around a bit, and can't find the notes i remembered
[03:00:49] <ThKo> Omar-: No, doesn’t work. I think it’s a problem with the IDs … jQuery mobile sees the same IDs for the checkboxes and loads the „old“ one.
[03:00:49] <Cork> can't actually find any notes on styling the overlay at all
[03:02:04] <qyrie> Cork: ah thanks for the help
[03:02:24] <Omar-> ThKo do you remove previous ones from DOM prior to adding new ones?
[03:02:25] <qyrie> lets see anyone else might come up
[03:02:38] <ThKo> Omar-: No, I don’t. I check, moment
[03:05:50] <MaxSlot> Omar- one problem firefox and ie
[03:06:06] <ThKo> Omar-: Ok, testing with $( „…“ ).remove() doesn’t help :(
[03:09:50] <Omar-> MaxSlot FF: DOMMouseScroll IE: onmousewheel
[03:10:06] <Omar-> MaxSlot Webkit: mousewheel
[03:10:35] <MaxSlot> ty
[03:10:57] <Omar-> ThKo it's really difficult to pinpoint the problem without seeing it live. if you have a live link or can reproduce the problem in fiddle, it will facilitate finding a solution
[03:11:02] <Omar-> MaxSlot np :)
[03:15:08] <ThKo> Omar-: Yes, I understand. I’m sorry and thanks anyway for your efforts! Yesterday it has helped my a lot! :-) I’ll try another thing.
[03:16:58] <zadruga> Hi there. I need a little help. I'm trying to enqueue a script for a jQuery function plugin, and I really don't know what I'm doing. The script is okay (it comes from the developer). It is: jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[03:16:58] <zadruga> $(‘.menu-tooltip’).LiteTooltip();
[03:16:58] <zadruga> });
[03:17:21] <zadruga> But I don't know the function ... how to name it, etc.
[03:17:40] <zadruga> what i have, which is for sure wrong is:
[03:17:44] <zadruga> function tooltip() {
[03:17:44] <zadruga> 	wp_enqueue_script( 'LiteTooltip', get_template_directory_uri() . '/tooltip/tooltip.js', array(), '1.0.0', true );
[03:17:44] <zadruga> }
[03:17:44] <zadruga> add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', '.menu-tooltip' );
[03:17:55] <Omar-> ThKo no problem. If you manage to get a live link, let me know.
[03:17:55] <zadruga> can some see the obvious
[03:18:05] <zadruga> I don't know how to name it, this is the main thing
[03:18:34] <Mark_____> does anybody know the reason why this isn’t working? http://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/1/
[03:19:09] <Mark_____> now im exhausted.
[03:20:07] <ThKo> Omar-: Of course :-) I’ve the problem. When I remove .ehanceWithin() it works ;)
[03:21:26] <Omar-> ThKo .enhanceWithin() is to create dynamically added elements. I dont think its causing the problem. There must be something else
[03:24:05] <ThKo> Omar-: When I remove it, the app works fine (but with unstyled checkboxes) … I don’t know why. Maybe it’s a problem somewhere else in association with .enhanceWithin()
[03:24:05] <zadruga> here it is on a pastebin, the two together, if someone can help.
[03:24:07] <zadruga> http://pastebin.com/bSkwta6X
[03:34:35] <zadruga> anyone?
[03:46:34] <ThKo> Omar-: By not adding enhanceWithin() or trigger(‚create‘) it works fine but is unstyled…I think it’s fouc
[03:51:14] <Kartagis> Mark_____: what is it supposed to do?
[03:51:31] <Mark_____> sec. i messed up the code
[03:54:18] <Mark_____> http://jsfiddle.net/trbuzhh6/1/

[04:00:45] <Elirips> Hello again. Anyone an idea what might be going wrong, if $.ajax falls into the error handler and the 'testStatus' is 'errorServer'?
[04:01:34] <Elirips> Invalid json content? Content-Length not matching data length? any hints?
[04:03:56] <Elirips> ah, sorry, textStatus is 'error' and the errorThrown is probably 'Server Error'
[04:11:13] <clearcut> any good plugin/module for heatmaps - world heatmap or something like this?
[04:15:41] <Erwat> Elirips: i don't know much about your question but to me it sounds like a... server error
[04:16:01] <Erwat> is the HTTP status 5XX (>= 500)?
[04:25:52] <qyrie> hi all i am having trouble to view the video in fullscreen
[04:26:08] <qyrie>  after playing when i click on full screen
[04:26:15] <hirsty> zebra datepicker plugin anyone?
[04:26:20] <qyrie>  it is coming back to normal
[04:26:20] <qyrie> <seaSS> this is the url http://staging-p.picplaypost.com/X2q0hLtxuyAP-3QYVf-f4Q/
[04:26:52] <qyrie> i see this issue in chrome but then mozilla it seems to be working
[04:42:31] <Elirips> Erwat: thx. I just see in the server source that the server sends the 'Server Error'
[04:43:07] <Erwat> Elirips: next time you have something like that try checking the HTTP status code
[04:43:32] <Erwat> Elirips: if it's 5XX eg 500 then the server is essentially sending the message that something went wrong and it's a server issue
[05:43:06] <BeWilled> What standards exist to develope a responsive web application? I'm getting unwanted UI behaviour when I included jquery mobile.js . I just want it to apply to smaller screen devices
[05:44:12] <BeWilled> I'm thinking it might be "better" just to have a mobile version of the page: like m.example.com
[05:48:01] <MaxSlot> BeWilled http://getbootstrap.com/
[05:48:11] <abailarri> Why it not work? http://jsfiddle.net/dnda0yyL/2/
[05:49:08] <Cork> abailarri: a message isn't a dom element
[05:49:14] <Cork> so you can't add css values to it
[05:49:58] <abailarri> Cork, I want to add the string "a message" after the div here
[05:50:13] <Cork> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/dnda0yyL/3/
[05:50:35] <abailarri> ouch!
[05:50:36] <Cork> abailarri: 1. parsing error, 2. after() is NOT what fadeIn acts on
[05:50:43] <Cork> fadeIn acts on .here
[05:50:55] <Cork> 3. a message is a string
[05:51:00] <Cork> so you can't fade it in
[05:51:15] <MaxSlot> I think you can use append
[05:51:22] <Cork> 4. it is visible by default so fadeIn wouldn't do anything even if it was an element
[05:51:29] <Cork> MaxSlot: after is fine
[05:51:38] <abailarri> Cork, and how can I fadeIn the string?
[05:51:42] <Cork> it's all the other points that cause problems :)
[05:51:49] <Cork> abailarri: you can't
[05:51:53] <Cork> it needs an element
[05:53:09] <abailarri> Cork, there is no way to insert the div with fadein efect?
[05:53:14] <abailarri> http://jsfiddle.net/dnda0yyL/4/
[05:54:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/dnda0yyL/5/
[05:55:22] <abailarri> why do you use hide?
[05:55:36] <Cork> cause else it would be visible from the start
[05:55:49] <Cork> fading from opacity: 1 to opacity: 1
[05:55:57] <Cork> gives very little animations :)
[05:57:33] <MaxSlot> http://jsfiddle.net/aukyz8ap/18/
[05:58:14] <abailarri> Cork, but in my case the div is not visible when the page loads, the divs print in a success ajax function
[05:58:33] <Cork> abailarri: i don't follow what you mean
[05:58:40] <Cork> if you create a dom element
[05:58:47] <Cork> it will have the default display value
[05:58:58] <Cork> display: block for div or display: inline for span
[05:59:09] <Cork> that means when it is appended to the dom it will be visible
[05:59:27] <Cork> so there is nothing to change when you call fadeIn
[05:59:31] <Cork> as it is already visible
[06:01:37] <abailarri> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/df8c1d1d/
[06:01:56] <Cork> abailarri: sigh...
[06:02:07] <Cork> generated dom isn't hidden by default
[06:02:26] <Cork> if it comes from an ajax call or anything else doesn't matter
[06:02:38] <abailarri> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/df8c1d1d/1/
[06:02:41] <abailarri> is not possible?
[06:02:49] <Cork> BAH
[06:02:54] <Cork> i gave you the answer before
[06:03:13] <Cork> you need to hide the element before you can fade them in
[06:03:26] <abailarri> Cork, something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18237240/ajax-post-fade-in-after-success
[06:03:26] <Cork> if they are a string you need to wrap them in a dom element
[06:03:30] <Cork> i have you the coe for it
[06:03:33] <Cork> ...

[06:54:15] <MaxSlot> $('video').bind 'webkit where () ?
[06:54:22] <MaxSlot> bind 'webkit where () ?
[06:54:27] <qyrie> i think it is unable to recognize the string "webkitfullscreenchange"
[06:54:39] <Omnipotent> But, The main problem here is, I need to identify how many types are there before hand, because I need to generate css and jquery code beforehand
[06:55:00] <Omnipotent> Otherwise, I need to process on same array at 3 times for generating HTML, CSS and JQuery code.
[06:55:03] <qyrie> MaxSlot: yes
[06:55:06] <Omnipotent> Is there any better method?
[06:55:13] <qyrie> on that line
[06:55:23] <MaxSlot> no quotes in your bind
[06:55:31] <Omnipotent> qyrie, Any clue about my question?
[06:56:42] <qyrie> i wrote it in coffeescript are you familiar?

[08:30:34] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to trigger a click on one div after print this with othe function: http://jsfiddle.net/7w18o5xd/3/
[08:33:12] <albipri> Hi! I need to run a function after some ajax calls here https://gist.github.com/albertopriore/58d294baf9d6d7ffa088 I’ve pasted what I need. I need that the variable show_data “$('.show_data').html(show_data);” have to be called after all the ajax calls inside the each
[08:34:12] <diphtherial> hey, so i'm having a somewhat predictable issue: i have a bunch of svgs on the page (rendered via d3) that i'd like to stretch to fill the page, so i attached resize handlers on the window to resize each one
[08:34:35] <diphtherial> the problem is that every time the svgs resize, it resizes the window, which resizes the svgs (i think)
[08:34:50] <diphtherial> anyway, it's an endless loop of resizing; very frusrtating and slow
[08:36:54] <diphtherial> i'm somewhat confused that it's endlessly refiring, since i register the 'resize' event on the window -- the window shouldn't change dimensions if the contents of the window change, right?
[08:38:01] <diphtherial> here's some actual code: https://dpaste.de/vT5U
[08:39:22] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/7eb7rru3/ how can i use the var inside jquery expression ?
[08:39:52] <diphtherial> xnotte: it's just javascript; use the string concatenator operator
[08:40:14] <diphtherial> e.g. .filter('[value="' + providerType + '"]')
[08:41:03] <diphtherial> i realize now how slim the chances of my question being answered are
[08:42:16] <cohitre> diphtherial: could your event be bubbling up?
[08:42:40] <cohitre> you trigger resize on the svg and don’t call event.preventDefault()
[08:43:06] <albipri> Hi! I need to run a function after some ajax calls here http://goo.gl/qHSdcL I’ve pasted what I need. I need that the variable show_data “$('.show_data').html(show_data);” have to be called after all the ajax calls inside the each
[08:43:21] <diphtherial> cohitre: aha, thanks
[08:43:59] <jimi_> Using the jquery masked input plugin, if i set the value of a field programmatically, how can i have the mask then apply afterwards? i tried .trigger('focus') and .trigger('click') but neither seemed to work
[08:50:23] <diphtherial> cohitre: hrm, i'm returning false from the event handler, which should both prevent the default event and stop it from propogating
[08:50:45] <diphtherial> i think it should be noted that there are two components on the page that both listen for the window's resize event and both resize themselves
[08:50:51] <diphtherial> i'll try disabling one
[08:52:12] <NoiseEee> diphtherial:  explicitly stop the event and propagation.
[08:54:49] <diphtherial> NoiseEee: no luck; here's the revised function for reference: https://dpaste.de/kVo8
[08:55:21] <diphtherial> the inner function gets called continuously, spamming the console with "!! Resize..."
[08:55:38] <NoiseEee> why are you even returning a function?
[08:55:51] <diphtherial> NoiseEee: because i parameterize it with the object that i'd like to resize
[08:56:12] <NoiseEee> you have more than one 'chart' on the page?
[08:56:26] <diphtherial> yes; three, but one of them has its resize handler disabled
[08:56:29] <xnotte> diphtherial: thans
[08:56:35] <diphtherial> i've tried it with a single chart and the same thing happened
[08:57:08] <NoiseEee> 'one of them has its resize handler disabled' what does that mean? you've got an event listener on window
[08:57:52] <diphtherial> NoiseEee: sorry, what i mean is that i have two separate calls to $(window).on('resize', handleResize($someObject)); where $someObject varies
[08:58:22] <NoiseEee> i don't know your setup exactly, but why wouldn't you   $('svg').on('resize',handleResize)  ?
[08:58:59] <diphtherial> NoiseEee: it's because it's the parent container that's resizing as a result of the window changing its size, not the svg itself
[08:59:16] <diphtherial> the svg in fact doesn't resize on its own, which is why i wrote this js hack
[08:59:31] <diphtherial> i could attach the resize handler on the parent container instead of the window
[08:59:41] <NoiseEee> i would for sure try that at least
[08:59:54] <diphtherial> either way, i'm confused that the window resize handler is firing repeatedly anyway; i wouldn't think that a child inside the window resizing itself would change the window's size
[09:00:10] <robertmaxrees> event bubbling probably.
[09:00:48] <diphtherial> robertmaxrees: i attempted to disable that with event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation(), but that's possible, agreed
[09:01:03] <diphtherial> it'd be nice to know under what conditions the window fires a resize event
[09:01:08] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/resize
[09:01:22] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to run stopPropagation on the resize of the SVG, not of the window.,
[09:01:34] <diphtherial> robertmaxrees: ah
[09:01:34] <NoiseEee> and a similar prob to yours is mentioned (throttling) in first example
[09:01:42] <diphtherial> NoiseEee: thanks
[09:02:08] <NoiseEee> also i'd peek at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15902920/resizing-an-element-triggers-the-resize-event-of-the-window
[09:03:12] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[09:03:18] <robertmaxrees> that illustrates the point
[09:03:39] <diphtherial> ok, i think this is much clearer now; thanks, both of you
[09:03:42] <diphtherial> i appreciate your patience
[09:04:33] <robertmaxrees> read up on "event bubbling"
[09:06:43] <juslintek> Can anyone help me with this code: http://jsfiddle.net/a7x651zj/15/. It wont work over here as it should because it involves php returning data from db. So here is the deal. Why afer I update my cart toggle box its elements are not responding anymore. Seems like they aren't listening for event anymore. Or click events arent passed.
[09:06:53] <juslintek> How to solve this problem.
[09:08:17] <NoiseEee> juslintek: are you getting errors in your console?
[09:08:47] <juslintek> NoiseEee nope
[09:08:59] <juslintek> I wish I had.
[09:09:14] <NoiseEee> juslintek: your problem is that *new* elements don't respond, or ones that were responding before?
[09:10:47] <juslintek> Well after update they do not respond. As long as no ajax success $(element).html(data); is made it works. But after that it stops responding.
[09:11:23] <NoiseEee> you're replacing elements with html?
[09:11:33] <juslintek> NoiseEee yes
[09:11:46] <NoiseEee> juslintek: well the elements you *were* observing are gone; they've been replaced
[09:12:10] <juslintek> NoiseEee, So how should I update them?
[09:12:12] <NoiseEee> juslintek: observe via a parent element that will always be in place... look up 'event delegation'
[09:13:00] <juslintek> Probably I should only replace on some action the html that wa schanged,
[09:13:04] <juslintek> Oh
[09:13:11] <juslintek> NoiseEee thanx :-)
[09:13:16] <juslintek> That is a nice tip to follow
[09:14:16] <guy> Do we have any redditors here? Some help getting this up please, http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/2j4mt0/table_of_contents_toc_generator/
[09:14:33] <guy> It is /r/jquery sub reddit, I suppose it is allowed here. : )
[09:16:05] <juslintek> NoiseEee as well one extra question. Do I have to write down all child elements which are required to unwrap to reach the the target element. Or element exist no matter how many layers deep it will be found?
[09:16:49] <NoiseEee> juslintek: similar to the previous question, events 'bubble'.  they will travel up through the DOM no matter how deep, unless explicitly stopped
[09:17:23] <juslintek> NoiseEee thanx, then another question, what for is find function?
[09:17:42] <juslintek> If I can just specify id of the element withing a wrapper
[09:17:44] <NoiseEee> juslintek: so $(parentReferenceThatIsAlwaysThere).on('click','.someClass',function() { alert('oh something with .someClass was found!') })
[09:18:03] <NoiseEee> juslintek: for navigating the DOM beneath the element.
[09:18:12] <NoiseEee> s/beneath/within
[09:29:50] <david-theory> morning :)
[09:47:07] <hactor> How do I "unset" a CSS property so it reverts to whatever the CSS for that element was before inlining a property value?
[09:47:54] <Otineb> hactor: I’m pretty sure you have to store the previous value first
[09:48:17] <hactor> Otineb, but but but.
[09:49:04] <hactor> Otineb, that's nasty, feels like I tattoo permanently values on an element when I call .css() :P
[09:49:08] <hactor> It shouldn't be like that.
[09:50:00] <Otineb> so your element already has a class/id with non-inline styles attached to it?
[09:50:09] <Otineb> and you want to temporarily give it inline styles
[09:50:18] <Otineb> and when you’re done, drop the inline styles?
[09:51:14] <hactor> Otineb, yup
[09:51:15] <Otineb> if that’s the case, then simply removing the inline styles will end the overridden styles. Like and order of operations. Inline styles always trump external style sheets
[09:51:28] <Otineb> …an* order of operations…
[09:51:41] <hactor> How do I selectively remove an inline style in jquery though
[09:51:50] <Otineb> got a fiddle?
[09:52:07] <hactor> Nope.
[09:52:15] <Otineb> www.jsfiddle.net
[09:52:19] <Otineb> set up your use case
[09:52:37] <hactor> I'm looking for a generic API
[09:52:40] <Otineb> you may want http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[09:52:48] <robertmaxrees> use .prop(), not attr()
[09:52:59] <Otineb> there he is!
[09:53:15] <robertmaxrees> you can also due .css('someProperty', '');

[09:53:52] <dmorrison> devsacherokee-sacherokee.rhcloud.com Need help please. Trying to make a div appear on hover of a menu li item by adding and removing a class from the div when hovering over the menu item. I have it working but when I zoom across the menu items it is not completing the functions before starting the next mouseover command. Any leads on how to fix this?
[09:53:52] <Otineb> right, clear it out
[09:54:37] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: is attr() not preferred in general?
[09:54:44] <Otineb> i’ve heard you recommend prop over it before
[09:54:47] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[09:54:57] <Otineb> ok
[09:55:02] <robertmaxrees> 95% of the time you thing you want .attr(), you really want .prop()
[09:55:25] <Otineb> when is it appropriate to use attr()?
[09:55:30] <Otineb> (in your opinion)
[09:55:39] <robertmaxrees> when you want to read markup, instead of DOM properties.
[09:55:43] <hactor> Otineb, attr() focused on modifying the DOM attribute, while prop() focuses on the runtime object property. Why are those detached is another messy story
[09:56:07] <Otineb> gotcha
[09:56:31] <robertmaxrees> dmorrison fyi you're much more likely to get help with a reduced test case.
[09:56:57] <dmorrison> robertmaxrees what is a reduced test case?
[09:57:10] <Otineb> a simpler version of the issue
[09:57:33] <robertmaxrees> Otineb http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ckeh195/3 this shows you the distinction between prop, attr, and includes .val()
[09:57:55] <robertmaxrees> dmorrison just the stuff you're working with - http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[09:59:16] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: whoa. Nice breakdown.
[10:00:07] <robertmaxrees> i finally made it because some people were acting like the difference was minimal and I was just being a pedantic ass.
[10:00:20] <Otineb> lol
[10:00:35] <Otineb> pedantic in serious programming?
[10:00:35] <robertmaxrees> and though I AM a pedantic ass, I wasn't wrong hahahaha
[10:00:44] <Otineb> HAHA
[10:01:11] <dmorrison> I am not really sure what the correct question is to be asking that is why it is general. I am using serveral things and I am not sure if I am using them correctly. When I mouseover it is supposed to remove a class and add a new one using a fadeout. It works properly when I wait for the fadeout and fadein to finish but if I mouseover the next menu item before the fades finish it doesn't...
[10:01:13] <dmorrison> ...remove the show class and add the hidden class.
[10:01:36] <robertmaxrees> dmorrison so replicate just the minimal stuff to illustrate what you're trying to do.
[10:01:45] <dmorrison> k
[10:02:12] <robertmaxrees> not the full page - test cases can even be just an example of a specific thing without all the extra BS styling and stuff.
[10:13:46] <juslintek> NoiseEee, I'm trying to select DOM like this: $('.krepselio-detales').children('a.remove').click(function (event) {..., but is seems its not responding. Am I doing it wrong?
[10:14:11] <dmorrison> http://jsfiddle.net/gpL3c6zx/
[10:14:16] <dmorrison> :)
[10:14:30] <robertmaxrees> $('.krepselio-detales').find('a.remove').on('click', function() {}); <- juslintek does this work?
[10:15:03] <robertmaxrees> dmorrison woah...
[10:15:16] <dmorrison> robertmaxrees that bad huh?
[10:15:29] <robertmaxrees> lots of repeading yourself, at least.  let's clean that part up :)
[10:16:10] <juslintek> it works, but only for single click. After that it gets unresponsive. Because html returned is different.
[10:16:28] <robertmaxrees> juslintek then you need to use event delegation.
[10:16:37] <juslintek> Probably is different as NoiseEE said not observative.
[10:16:46] <dmorrison> I knew there was probably a cleaner way to do it.
[10:16:49] <robertmaxrees> $('.krepselio-detales').on('click', '.remove', function() {});
[10:16:50] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[10:17:37] <juslintek> robertmaxrees, you saved me :-D
[10:17:49] <juslintek> And as well what about event delegation
[10:18:03] <juslintek> what doest that mean, how to perform this wizardry?
[10:18:20] <robertmaxrees> read this: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:19:24] <robertmaxrees> dmorrison so what is this trying to do?  when you hover over a menu item, fade in its corresponding section?
[10:19:41] <dmorrison> fade out the old section and fade in the new section
[10:20:01] <dmorrison> it works when you hover over each item slowly but when you move quick it breaks
[10:20:15] <dmorrison> and all sections end up being exposed
[10:21:03] <robertmaxrees> dmorrison you're getting tripped up by the even queue stuff.
[10:21:07] <robertmaxrees> *event
[10:21:27] <dmorrison> functions not finishing before new one starts
[10:21:38] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[10:21:54] <robertmaxrees> first off - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gpL3c6zx/2/
[10:22:10] <robertmaxrees> this cleans up your code.  added a data attribute to each menu item, but that makes your JS much simpler.
[10:22:33] <dmorrison> wow, yes it does
[10:23:09] <robertmaxrees> woops - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gpL3c6zx/3/ there we go.
[10:24:31] <dmorrison> data-section is new to me, i'll read about that
[10:24:36] <robertmaxrees> data-*
[10:24:40] <robertmaxrees> they're called data attributes.
[10:24:45] <dmorrison> k
[10:24:58] <robertmaxrees> just an easy way to store extra information on a node.
[10:27:39] <robertmaxrees> the next thing I'd do is step through the code - what is happening each time you hover.  lines 6 through 9 look... wrong to me.
[10:28:32] <dmorrison> why wouldn't you want to remove the show class and add the hidden class?
[10:28:47] <robertmaxrees> that's not the problme - the order is.
[10:29:09] <robertmaxrees> you're waiting for that animation to complete before running the add/remove
[10:29:11] <robertmaxrees> see the problem?
[10:29:36] <dmorrison> but if i add the hidden class to the element first then it will disappear before the fade
[10:29:54] <robertmaxrees> right - so what's the fix?
[10:30:37] <dmorrison> remove class show first then fade then add class hidden?
[10:30:47] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the hidden class, technically.
[10:31:08] <dmorrison> now i'm confused, hidden class is tied to displaynone
[10:31:23] <dmorrison> if i don't have that then it doesn't dispear.
[10:31:47] <robertmaxrees> ss, technically.

[10:32:48] <duch_kazatel> hrmmmm.
[10:33:25] <duch_kazatel> anyway dmorrison change your css to hide those by default - don't rely on a class for it.
[10:33:55] <dmorrison> if someone has js turned off then they will not see any of the sections
[10:34:44] <robertmaxrees> it'll be no different than it is now.
[10:34:54] <dmorrison> how they see the first section only
[10:35:00] <dmorrison> now they see the first section only

[10:38:21] <robertmaxrees> what's funny is you're basically having the reverse problem most people have when dealing with animations.
[10:38:40] <robertmaxrees> you DON'T want the callback in this case - you just want to charge ahead.
[10:38:54] <decx> BillCriswell bit late but i just saw your old highlight and yes, dragging an image into a canvas an then doing new Image(src) should work just fine
[10:39:34] <BillCriswell> decx: I needed to make the image draggable and all that shit on the canvas, but I actually found something that's working well without doing all that through canvas.
[10:39:36] <dmorrison> not following you on the callback
[10:39:42] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/bogoyafucuve/1/edit if you're curious
[10:40:01] <BillCriswell> The right side is a canvas representation of the DOM element.
[10:40:31] <robertmaxrees> dmorrison you had that inline function() {} in the fadeIn and fadeOut, right?
[10:40:32] <jaspertheghost> need to remove all select options that dont contain the word "non-serve" -> the index gets updated everytime i remove an item.... how do i get around this
[10:40:41] <robertmaxrees> you didn't need that in this case, dmorrison
[10:41:23] <dmorrison> robertmaxrees k, makes sense
[10:41:24] <decx> BillCriswell hehe looks like changing the draworder in canvas is a bit more involved than z-index ^^
[10:41:46] <robertmaxrees> jaspertheghost could you share some code to show what you're talking about?
[10:42:10] <BillCriswell> decx: That's what I figured. Luckily that html2canvas library thingie works well.
[10:52:11] <BillCriswell> decx: Now I want to figure out how if I get it to like a gutter it puts it back at the bottom...Don't think it'll be too bad but I'm lazy.
[10:58:43] <jaspertheghost> whats wrong with this code
[10:58:44] <jaspertheghost> if (xx.options[xx.selectedIndex].text.indexOf('non-serve') != -1) {
[10:59:20] <BillCriswell> Nothing on the surface.
[10:59:28] <robertmaxrees> console.log() each bit - xx.options, then xx.options[xx.selectedIndex], etc.
[11:05:45] <SmashingX> hi guys, is there any channel for jquery mobile?
[11:06:05] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX look at the topic ;)
[11:06:06] <robertmaxrees> you're there.,
[11:07:33] <benzhninja> Hi, I'm having some trouble with jquery on Windows 8
[11:08:31] <benzhninja> I have assigned $(document).on("click" .. to an element that I wish for a user to either click or touch. However when I touch the element, nothing happens. To trigger the event, I have to either double tap or repeatedely tap it
[11:08:52] <benzhninja> is there another call I can make rather than on("click") thats optimised for touch?
[11:09:55] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: I just see in the topic the link of jquery mobile
[11:10:09] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: so I can ask about jquery mobile here too?
[11:10:14] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX yep :)
[11:10:25] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: oh nice, thanks
[11:12:50] <benzhninja> anyone?
[11:12:59] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ benzhninja
[11:13:11] <robertmaxrees> awww the bot's being lame - could you fiddle up an example?
[11:13:33] <benzhninja> ok
[11:13:38] <SmashingX> so, robertmaxrees Im really new in jquery mobile, Im now downloading Eclipse ADT with Android SDK
[11:13:55] <SmashingX> what else do you think I need to get started?
[11:14:01] <robertmaxrees> neither of those.
[11:14:15] <SmashingX> ?
[11:14:38] <robertmaxrees> jquery mobile is for mobile web apps - you don't need the android SDK for that because you're not running natively on the device.
[11:14:54] <robertmaxrees> and eclipse isn't needed either since you don't know a lot of what it offers.
[11:16:33] <robertmaxrees> benzhninja you're about to get yourself banned from #javascript.
[11:17:19] <benzhninja> robertmaxrees: I found out a solution
[11:17:21] <benzhninja> I'm going to use the jquery mobile touch events plugin
[11:17:23] <benzhninja> although, any device can have touch, not just mobile devices. bad jquery, bad
[11:17:39] <robertmaxrees> benzhninja not bad jquery - bad developer :)
[11:20:39] <benzhninja> why?
[11:20:41] <benzhninja> why would jquery desktop not support touch events if some laptops have touchscreens?
[11:21:11] <robertmaxrees> why would you expect 'click' to imply touch events? :D
[11:21:40] <benzhninja> because when you touch a link, it acts the same way as if you clicked it
[11:22:01] <robertmaxrees> that's all on the browser imo.
[11:22:08] <benzhninja> ok
[11:22:35] <benzhninja> well it is like that in all browsers, because if it wasnt touch screen users would get pretty angry
[11:23:11] <robertmaxrees> up to you to know which events you want to subscribe to.
[11:23:20] <benzhninja> ok
[11:23:28] <benzhninja> well, actually the problem isnt the touch events
[11:23:41] <benzhninja> every other elements touch events is working
[11:23:59] <benzhninja> I'm expecting to find a blocking element on top of the one I'm trying to tap
[11:24:01] <benzhninja> brb
[11:27:57] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: yesterday you told me about cookie option for fetching data from another page. can I grab data from several fields and throw them in 1 cookie?
[11:28:02] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone can help me with this script? http://jsfiddle.net/kem4paba/7/ I'm trying to execute a click function with a selector printed with after() function
[11:28:14] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis sure - the cookie is basically just a string anyway.
[11:28:42] <robertmaxrees> you can put whatever you want there, but be careful with how much you do.
[11:31:53] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: here's the scenario: I've got a select with keys like eco, inter, stan, pre and van. and in another select I've got stuff like local_drop etc. when grabbing data, how can I do something like "grab data from local_drop where other select is eco"?
[11:32:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:32:22] <Kartagis> I assume it can be done, but not sure of the syntax
[11:32:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't even know what you just asked.
[11:32:56] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: want a quick fiddle?
[11:33:03] <robertmaxrees> sure
[11:33:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm about to head out on lunch though.
[11:33:10] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[11:42:25] <MeXTuX> I have a jQuery object $list which is a list <ul> How can I select child li based on the text??? Say the li text is "orange" <li>Orange</li>
[11:43:15] <_rai> :contains
[11:45:07] <ciqsteve> Q does anyone ever have a problem with .find() not finding stuff buried in the dom?
[11:49:01] <pythys> Hi everyone. How can I capture the event when a text box is changed but still did not lose focus. .change() and .keyup() are not doing the trick for me!
[11:49:43] <BillCriswell> MeXTuX: Could do like $list.children().filter(function(){ return $(this).text().trim() === 'Orange'; }); if you need it to be exactly "Orange".
[11:57:12] <z1haze> is there a way in datatables to sort by multiple columns, like first sort by company, then sort all in that company by date hired, or something
[11:57:44] <BillCriswell> z1haze: http://www.datatables.net/examples/basic_init/multi_col_sort.html
[11:57:53] <z1haze> i cant figure it out I was just there
[11:58:01] <z1haze> at least was in right place
[11:59:09] <BillCriswell> z1haze: "User shift click on a column (added the clicked column as a secondary, tertiary etc ordering column)."
[12:00:24] <z1haze> what would the code look like for first sort by column 6, then by 1?
[12:00:36] <lintguy> Is it possible to load an image to an img tag, then upload it using ajax?
[12:02:28] <BillCriswell> z1haze: I don't have any code in front of me but you'd have go give an option something that looks like this: [ [6,'asc'], [1,'asc'] ]
[12:02:33] <z1haze> i dont need the shift clicking BillCriswell, I need it on load
[12:02:46] <z1haze> yea I tried that, it does them independently though
[12:12:25] <BillCriswell> z1haze: http://jsbin.com/haxiferubaxe/1/edit?js,output
[12:13:00] <z1haze> i guess my date field just isnt being interpretted properly
[12:13:32] <BillCriswell> Bummer.
[12:16:43] <BillCriswell> z1haze: Try the date in Date.parse() and if it works you're good, if not might need to sort that column on a data attribute of some sort.
[12:17:59] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: http://datatables.net/purchase/index this seems to be why he doesn't offer an official support channel.
[12:18:03] <z1haze> its being pulled from a database in php though would it still be able to work
[12:19:01] <BillCriswell> Doesn't matter how it gets there.
[12:20:28] <BillCriswell> What's the date format z1haze?
[12:20:41] <z1haze> mysql datetime
[12:20:58] <z1haze> 2014-10-01 00:00:00
[12:20:59] <BillCriswell> So Ymd H:i:s ?
[12:21:59] <z1haze> y-m-d h:m:s
[12:22:40] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell there's a free version and a paid version.  you can join the forums for free.
[12:22:40] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/cb4zdnyy/ <--- how does this look?
[12:22:57] <BillCriswell> You can put data-sort="<?php echo str_replace(array(' ', '-', ':'), '', $date) ?>" on the TD you're outputting the date to.
[12:23:04] <robertmaxrees> http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/23852/needs-an-irc-channel#latest
[12:23:06] <BillCriswell> I think that's the argument order for ste_Replace
[12:23:18] <scrubfest> Anybody used this: http://unslider.com/ before?
[12:29:25] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Ah interesting.
[12:33:01] <BillCriswell> z1haze: Date seems fine in that format...
[12:35:01] <BillCriswell> z1haze: http://jsbin.com/haxiferubaxe/2/edit?js,output
[12:37:06] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/haxiferubaxe/3/edit?js,output
[12:37:18] <BillCriswell> Didn't feel like padding the zeros.
[12:38:00] <z1haze> hey, am here sorry had run off real fast
[12:38:50] <z1haze> BillCriswell, I see how you did it except my date is not in a variable
[12:39:19] <z1haze> i just am using <?=$row['date']?>
[12:39:27] <z1haze> from my mysql query
[12:39:59] <BillCriswell> If the date is really Y-m-d H:i:s it should parse just fine.
[12:40:57] <BillCriswell> You can totally ignore the parts where I'm adding those <td>s since datatables doesn't know any better. To datatables it was there when the page loaded.
[12:41:17] <z1haze> http://dev.hendricksweb.com/smalljobs/serverreports/index.php
[12:42:06] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/cb4zdnyy/ <--- what am I doing wrong here?
[12:42:10] <z1haze> this is doing it correctly then i think
[12:42:55] <BillCriswell> z1haze: Yes.
[12:43:02] <z1haze> sweet, thanks.
[12:43:07] <BillCriswell> lol welcome
[12:43:24] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: I think you want .on('change'
[12:43:27] <z1haze> I had it right the whole time but i was stupid and didnt change the date on the 2 empty "punished" ones
[12:43:41] <BillCriswell> z1haze: Happens to everyone.
[12:43:51] <Kartagis> right
[12:43:57] * Kartagis headpalms
[12:44:49] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: what else? I can't get it to work
[12:46:14] <Kartagis> this gives me [object Object]
[12:46:17] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: divs don't have values.
[12:46:19] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/cb4zdnyy/1/
[12:46:30] <BillCriswell> .text() instead of .val() is probably what you want.
[12:46:52] <Kartagis> I replaced
[12:47:10] <Kartagis> the above gives me [object Object]
[12:47:31] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/cb4zdnyy/2/
[12:47:52] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: It feels like you're doing something very weird though. What's your goal?
[12:48:49] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: suppose the select is one page, and inputs are on  another, and there is also another select
[12:49:30] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: I want to write the corresponding value to a cookie when user selects values from both selects
[12:50:43] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Should this be done in steps? Like submit something on page one then the user goes to page two?
[12:51:04] <okimoyo> I really need some guidance and direction with jquery (it's for a good cause I promise). I need to find a way to make some cells within a table clickable, and only selection deselect any other cells which were selected.
[12:51:08] <kevireilly> Kartagis: you're getting [object Object] because you're essentially placing `text` inside the #div with the return from $('#field_foo')
[12:51:27] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: no no, user doesn't go to page two
[12:51:48] <kevireilly> perhaps you mean to attach a method to it
[12:51:50] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: he just fetches the corresponding values
[12:52:07] <okimoyo> I figured out how to do an animation effect for selected cells which is satisfactory, but I'm having a lot of trouble making the cells respond to click and figuring out how to deactivate the other cells
[12:52:28] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis wait what?
[12:52:46] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying change things on page 2 via changing them on page one?
[12:52:47] <okimoyo> The application is a map of beds for a homeless shelter, and the user is selecting a bed for someone then submitting the page (backend in django)
[12:52:51] <robertmaxrees> but the user never goes to page 2?
[12:53:04] <kevireilly> okimoyo: $('.active').removeClass('active'); $('element').click(function(){ $(this).addClass('active'); });
[12:53:24] <kevireilly> er the removeClass should probably be in the click callback, woops ;)
[12:53:26] <BillCriswell> okimoyo: Animating table cells you will have a bad time.
[12:53:32] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: fetch values from page 2 when select on page 1 changes
[12:53:37] <BillCriswell> Well. depending on what you're animating.
[12:53:52] <okimoyo> BillCriswell: This seems to work alright as a test piece http://hastebin.com/wacofawimu.xml
[12:53:54] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis that's kind of unusual
[12:53:57] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: does this make sense?
[12:54:11] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis i understand what you want to do, but it seems really unusual.
[12:54:24] <BillCriswell> okimoyo: It's when you animate things like margins and stuff that it gets bad. I kind of jumped the gun there.
[12:55:19] <okimoyo> kevireilly: I have a bunch of cells in my table which represent beds (they all share a class). How do I bind so that each cell in that list has that behavior
[12:55:40] <robertmaxrees> $('td').on('click', function() {});
[12:56:26] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: so, you suggestion is still cookies?
[12:56:33] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: In the callback function do I need a this keyword for my selector?
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis not in the slightest, Kartagis
[12:56:48] <robertmaxrees> if the user never goes to page 2, that doesn't make sense.
[12:57:11] <robertmaxrees> okimoyo the `this` keyword will be the element that you clicked, yes
[12:58:18] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: what is your suggestion then? or is there one?
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> could you explain your project so i know what you're workjing with?
[13:05:23] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: Am I misuing 'this'? http://hastebin.com/amaxenucis.xml
[13:06:01] <robertmaxrees> you're using the functions wrong.
[13:06:37] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: That doesn't surprise me in the least, could you clarify in any way?
[13:07:21] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/d9usjvo/#url=4ehko87
[13:07:49] <abailarri> Exists any finction that fires when session is closed?
[13:08:43] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: hey man. I’m trying to understand a line of someone’s script. It goes….
[13:08:43] <Otineb> var parts = [], split = /[:.;?!] |(?: |^)["Ò]/g, index = 0;
[13:08:54] <Otineb> is this just a way to declare multiple variables?
[13:09:23] <__joshua__> yes, three variable
[13:09:31] <Otineb> __joshua__: thanks man
[13:09:42] <Otineb> not used to seeing it comma separated like that
[13:09:52] <__joshua__> its from c
[13:10:02] <Otineb> __joshua__: ah. those bastards are everywhere
[13:10:05] <Otineb> =)
[13:10:20] <__joshua__> think of it in terms of :  do all the things separated by commas, and i don't care what order you do them in
[13:10:30] <Otineb> gotcha. That’s nice
[13:10:46] <Otineb> is it best practice to do this?
[13:16:09] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: This is clearly wrong, but why is it wrong? I thought you were going to call a function after $(this) in your code... confused. http://hastebin.com/ovohahapuk.coffee
[13:17:25] <okimoyo> It pains me to ask newb questions nearly as much as it probably pains others to hear them, I wouldn't be coding this snippet in a language I don't know if I had a choice, sorry :(
[13:19:03] <ryanneufeld> Why is this a thing? http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v6r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.dp.xm.doc%2Fjson_jsonx.html
[13:20:33] <robertmaxrees> okimoyo why are you defining and then calling functions like that?
[13:21:05] <okimoyo> Trying to get an animation to loop so I can visually show that a cell is selected. Is there a better way?
[13:21:20] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:21:31] <robertmaxrees> sorry, handling some other stuff atm.
[13:21:33] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: Thx a lot for your patience
[13:21:48] <robertmaxrees> you could also search on google to see how to loop animations.
[13:23:50] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: I did search google, and this method was voted best on stackoverflow even though some peopple decried it as ugly
[13:24:42] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing doesn't really make any sense though
[13:24:43] <robertmaxrees> that's the issue.
[13:24:51] <robertmaxrees> can you set up a minimal test case?
[13:27:48] <okimoyo> I need to be able to have a user click on a table cell, which will then begin a loop animation to show that it is selected. If there are any other table cells selected they will deselect which will terminate any animation loops they might have. Ideally I'd somehow set a field which I can post to myself with the contents of the active cell.
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> great - could you set up a minimal test case?
[13:28:49] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: You mean the underlying webpage (w/o scripting)?
[13:29:27] <VictorVR> what is the software development big question?
[13:29:50] <robertmaxrees> okimoyo i mean just the bit you're working with right now.
[13:29:58] <decx> "why are endusers so stupid?"
[13:30:23] <VictorVR> kkkkkk
[13:31:43] <robertmaxrees> okimoyo the basic idea is you want to use a function that then calls itself - recursion.  http://stackoverflow.com/a/11764283/923919 this has a few different ways to accomplish that.
[13:39:01] <fatalhalt> hi, can anyone shed some light on why $(this) returns undefined for me
[13:39:02] <fatalhalt> $('#videos > li').each(function(ind) { var self = $(this) });
[13:39:24] <fatalhalt> the loop does loop
[13:42:25] <decx> i dont believe you
[13:47:39] <tbranyen> it's been a while, but i can't remember if jquery exports a copy of itself on itself
[13:47:42] <tbranyen> anyone know?
[13:47:46] <tbranyen> $.fn.? = $
[13:50:26] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: I don't see how their recursion method is so different from what I have there. For my use case I have a test page I created to figure out how to select cells and do everything I described - I haven't integrated it with the real table for the bed layout in the shelter.
[13:52:31] <robertmaxrees> http://hastebin.com/okuroyevot.coffee try this.
[13:52:56] <robertmaxrees> don't define a handler in your handler.
[13:55:57] <okimoyo> robertmaxrees: That seems sensible, and now I can bind it to any of the cells... seems like progress...
[13:56:28] <Kartagis> why would I get 'undefined is not a function' on the line $(document).on('input change','input,change', function() { when jquery version is 1.5.2?
[13:56:28] <BenLue> http://paste.debian.net/127032/ line 124 stand for?
[13:56:42] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis because .on() didn't exist yetr.
[13:57:00] <robertmaxrees> ben_alman huh?
[13:57:08] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong autotab
[13:57:15] <robertmaxrees> BenLue - huh?  which line?
[13:57:20] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: you mean in this context?
[13:57:31] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis i mean .on() didn't exist in 1.5.2
[13:57:39] <BenLue> robertmaxrees; 124
[13:57:52] <robertmaxrees> BenLue xaxis: 2, ?
[13:57:56] <BenLue> yes
[13:58:23] <robertmaxrees> that's a propery on an object - not sure what you're trying to figure out.
[13:59:02] <BenLue> robertmaxrees; i have modified this script! Here the Original: http://www.jqueryflottutorial.com/tester-9.html
[13:59:34] <Robdgreat> "I have altered the script. Pray I do not alter it further."
[13:59:53] <thecoolguy> How would i make a div slide to another div
[14:00:05] <robertmaxrees> BenLue instead of sending links to the code of your page and stuff, could you boil down your question to exactly what you want to know and maybe give us a test case of some kind?
[14:02:55] <BenLue> I have modified the script. I would like to know what does the command "xaxis: 2," Do I have to enter the number of lines?
[14:03:22] <BenLue> In the original were only 2 lines
[14:03:53] <robertmaxrees> use the documentation to tell you.
[14:05:08] <BenLue> :P
[14:05:22] <robertmaxrees> seriously.  that's what any of us would have to do.
[14:06:18] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: but you're supposed to read it for him and spoon feed the answer
[14:06:43] * BenLue slaps ChanServ with the documentation of jquery
[14:06:47] <decx> good reference Robdgreat
[14:06:52] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:06:58] <decx> it's actually the flot documentation
[14:07:14] <BenLue> ik
[14:07:22] <robertmaxrees> BenLue start readin' their docs.
[14:07:24] <BenLue> plz let me read :P
[14:13:18] <thecoolguy> ?
[14:14:29] <robertmaxrees> thecoolguy vague question - try again.
[14:14:50] <dmsuperman> we need a magic 8 ball bot
[14:15:06] <decx> return 4 // guaranteed to be random
[14:15:37] <Robdgreat> chosen by fair dice roll
[14:16:33] <thecoolguy> ok example. I have in one file two divs. I only want one div to be visible and i want it so when i click a button it currnet div slides out to the other div
[14:16:48] <thecoolguy> I'm trying to find out how to sliding part would be implemented
[14:16:53] <thecoolguy> how the*
[14:16:59] <robertmaxrees> "slides out to the other div" is the vague part.
[14:17:15] <BenLue> robertmaxrees; https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/API.md#data-format :)
[14:17:30] <robertmaxrees> BenLue okay?
[14:17:48] <decx> typically you have a wrapper around both divs and move that wrapper based on the width of one of the divs
[14:18:46] <BenLue> robertmaxrees; It is related to the date
[14:18:52] <dmsuperman> thecoolguy: http://www.menucool.com/responsive-slider ?
[14:18:57] <robertmaxrees> BenLue okay.
[14:19:00] <thecoolguy> ok for example say in the first div i have a button that says help. in the second div i have the actual help information. so when the button is clicked i want the first div to slide to the left out of the screen and the second screen to slide in
[14:19:18] <decx> let's just assume this is for educational purposes dmsuperman
[14:19:38] <dmsuperman> Educational purposes would probably have a better defined question :P but in that case
[14:19:48] <dmsuperman> jquery.animate with the hide/show methods
[14:20:05] <dmsuperman> animate hide on the div leaving screen, animate show on the div coming onto the screen
[14:20:13] <thecoolguy> ah
[14:20:59] <decx> just no
[14:21:13] <decx> css3 and toggle classes
[14:21:27] <dmsuperman> no.
[14:21:30] <dmsuperman> jquery.animate!
[14:21:32] <thecoolguy> is there something in css5 the acompishes it ?
[14:21:35] <thecoolguy> that*
[14:21:51] <decx> boooh, jquery.animate, boooh
[14:21:51] <thecoolguy> I heard it is better to go with css when you can :s ?
[14:21:59] <dmsuperman> better is subjective
[14:22:08] <dmsuperman> given that you're in #jquery I'm assuming you're already writing jquery code
[14:22:16] <decx> addClass() is jquery too ^^
[14:22:26] <dmsuperman> but requires you to go out of the JS and write CSS
[14:22:41] <dmsuperman> depending on your app that may add complexity. so I wouldn't say either is universally better
[14:23:08] <thecoolguy> Well if the code is shorter in jquery i wouild want to go with that then
[14:23:22] <thecoolguy> what is the feature called in css ?
[14:23:29] <dmsuperman> If your goal is education, try both
[14:23:32] <dmsuperman> see which you prefer
[14:23:58] <thecoolguy> what would i look up to see how to do it in css ?
[14:25:02] <dmsuperman> css animation
[14:26:31] <thecoolguy> in jquery do both the divs have to be in a wrapper?
[14:27:31] <decx> try something
[14:27:38] <decx> i have mine ready
[14:27:41] <robertmaxrees> play around, watch shit break, etc.
[14:27:47] <thecoolguy> :(
[14:28:48] <robertmaxrees> that's the fun part imo.
[14:29:09] <thecoolguy> not when u don't have a good starting point
[14:30:01] <robertmaxrees> but you do :) you have some stuff to research and some ideas to try out.
[14:41:22] <thecoolguy> not working properly x.x
[14:41:58] <thecoolguy> the div still stays visible for some reason and it's heigh increases
[14:42:36] <robertmaxrees> show us using js fiddle
[14:44:35] <thecoolguy> This is my function http://i.imgur.com/FT1gwuO.png
[14:44:44] <robertmaxrees> no screenshots :(
[14:45:20] <thecoolguy> http://pastie.org/private/deyvbgxuwfwt22afueergq
[14:45:35] <decx> it's something !
[14:45:38] <BenLue> robertmaxrees; :P
[14:46:12] <thecoolguy> :<
[14:46:39] <BenLue> robertmaxrees; my chart is working fine: http://ben.s3root.net/bella/demos/gewicht/
[14:47:00] <robertmaxrees> thecoolguy http://jsfiddle.net/ - use this :)
[14:47:05] <robertmaxrees> BenLue grats.
[14:47:12] <thecoolguy> i can't because of how my app is loaded
[14:47:22] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:47:34] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.  use your dev tools, select the element, and copy it.
[14:49:37] <thecoolguy> i can't because it is a office 365 app some of the javascript is done in methods that won't be called when loaded in a browser
[14:49:56] <dmsuperman> well, regardless, you can easily put "2 divs that hide" in a fiddle
[14:50:01] <dmsuperman> and then take the ideas you learn and apply them
[14:50:08] <decx> once you learn how to make separate test cases for these problems you'll be twice the dev
[14:51:36] <thecoolguy> then i have to rewrite a page in there and imports and images. Can't you just hint me as to what i'm doing wrong
[14:51:57] <dmsuperman> you have to rewrite a page in order to reproduce "two divs"?
[14:52:04] <decx> well you went with animate so superman will have to do that ^^
[14:52:12] <dmsuperman> I can do it in one line. Here you go: <div></div><div></div>
[14:52:32] <dmsuperman> with some CSS to make it obvious: div { border: 1px solid black; height: 100px; width: 100px; }
[14:52:37] <decx> ©
[14:53:24] <thecoolguy> don't i need a head importing jquery and all that
[14:53:42] <dmsuperman> jsfiddle provides an option to include jquery
[14:53:47] <dmsuperman> and writes your head for you
[14:54:00] <thecoolguy> hm
[14:54:48] <robertmaxrees> thecoolguy http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[14:56:00] <robertmaxrees> thecoolguy the other issue is, though I have you JS, i have no idea what your CSS/HTML looks like./
[14:56:32] <thecoolguy> is the problem my jquery ?
[14:56:34] <kevireilly> for instance, #content-main { display: block !important; } could cause that behavior
[14:56:46] <thecoolguy> hm
[14:57:12] <thecoolguy> god
[14:57:21] <thecoolguy> is there a progem that auto pasties ?
[14:57:41] <thecoolguy> i have one for ss but :/
[14:57:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:58:05] <thecoolguy> my content main http://i.imgur.com/VKvUJNG.png
[14:58:12] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[14:58:20] <robertmaxrees> just copy stuff to jsfiddle haha
[14:58:39] <Otineb> lol
[14:58:52] <thecoolguy> sorry bro dind't know it had colab lol
[14:59:07] <robertmaxrees> you can just "Save" it and send the updated URL.
[14:59:08] <Otineb> jsfiddle rocks
[14:59:26] <kevireilly> just out of curiosity, why are you animating something you intend to be hidden? perhaps .css would be more appropriate for that scenario
[14:59:46] <thecoolguy> i'm trying to slide between views
[15:00:24] <tiveron> tcd ..
[15:00:24] <tiveron> ls
[15:00:37] <kevireilly> .hide immediately hides the element, so the animation wouldn't be visible
[15:01:55] <thecoolguy> ugh
[15:03:12] <thecoolguy> ok so hide() doesn't work
[15:03:19] <thecoolguy> what could be causing that
[15:03:30] <thecoolguy> hide() just moves it to top left more
[15:04:17] <thecoolguy> doing it with "body" works though
[15:04:20] <thecoolguy> hm
[15:05:33] <thecoolguy> if i have <id="blah"><class="first">
[15:05:37] <thecoolguy> and the second was inside the second
[15:05:42] <BenLue> i need to get my chart in center! Actual my code is <div id="flot-placeholder" style="width:1100px;height:600px;margin:0 auto"></div> i have try it with margin-left:auto & margin-right: auto but this will not working
[15:05:50] <BenLue> http://ben.s3root.net/bella/demos/gewicht/
[15:05:59] <thecoolguy> how would i select it ? $("#blah.first") ?
[15:06:10] <robertmaxrees> #blah .first
[15:06:23] <thecoolguy> with a space ?
[15:06:27] <robertmaxrees> thecoolguy you should check out the jquery tutorial are learn.jquery.com
[15:06:28] <robertmaxrees> and yes
[15:06:42] <kevireilly> thecoolguy: <div id="blah" class="first"> yes it would be $('#blah.first')
[15:07:14] <kevireilly> thecoolguy: hide seems to work here http://jsfiddle.net/mt95poe3/
[15:07:48] <thecoolguy> becuase that is how my content main is. i'm wondering if i have to hide the class div also
[15:08:26] <robertmaxrees> BenLue that's a CSS question - try #css
[15:08:37] <kevireilly> thecoolguy: the class div? hiding the parent element should encompass all children elements when being hidden
[15:09:23] <kevireilly> thecoolguy: please use the jsfiddle link to demonstrate what you mean.. after making a change that you'd like to share, click Update in the top and share the new link
[15:11:55] <thecoolguy> Ok so  $('#content-main .padding').hide(); worked but  $('#content-main').hide(); didn't hide it
[15:12:11] <thecoolguy> css for padding is padding: 15px; why would that stop i from hiding ?
[15:12:20] <robertmaxrees> if you don't just us a fiddle, we're not going to be able to help.
[15:12:30] <robertmaxrees> *just give us
[15:24:17] <Otineb> does anyone know why does this function (validateField) returns undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/svztezLh/3/
[15:24:43] <robertmaxrees> because you're not returning from it.
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> you're returning from toTitleCase()
[15:25:27] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:18:23] <ashdr0> anyone into strange times?
[16:19:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> well that was interesting.
[16:30:05] <decx> what happened to thecoolguy
[16:30:37] <decx> my css based fiddle has been sitting around for 2 hours
[16:34:45] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:35:58] <decx> well i'm going to bed gn ^^
[16:49:06] <hExDJ_> can someone look at my form: http://jsbin.com/geqiwixu/121/edit  when typing in the first "Value" field the total gets computed instantly, but when I "add item" and type in that new item's value field it doesn't
[16:50:53] <robertmaxrees> first, use .val(), not .attr('value')
[16:51:09] <robertmaxrees> and you can't bind to things that don't exist yet.
[16:51:12] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[16:51:47] <hExDJ_> can u clarify?
[16:51:53] <hExDJ_> about event delegation
[16:52:35] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:53:05] <robertmaxrees> let me see if I can find a code example.
[16:53:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bgtjdq11/
[16:54:30] <robertmaxrees> the nice thing about the delegated listener is that it works for things you add later on.
[16:55:20] <hExDJ_> not sure I understand it, but will read about it
[16:55:34] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[16:55:38] <hExDJ_> from your example you're using a parent
[16:55:41] <hExDJ_> oh
[16:55:44] <robertmaxrees> look at the last example.
[16:56:00] <hExDJ_> yeah, that's what I was looking at
[17:07:45] <hExDJ_> robertmaxrees: would I have to triger the total calculation inside that?
[17:08:01] <hExDJ_> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {  call calculation here  });
[17:08:09] <hExDJ_> ?
[17:08:10] <robertmaxrees> yes, instead of your current .change.
[17:11:31] <hExDJ_> the jsbin got fudged
[17:12:22] <hExDJ_> weird, my local copy does work
[17:12:32] <hExDJ_> now the jsbin gets a blank when I hit ADD
[17:12:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:13:33] <hExDJ_> http://jsbin.com/geqiwixu/121/
[17:14:14] <robertmaxrees> you need to replace the $('input').click(function() { and stuff, too btw.
[17:14:53] <hExDJ_> oh ok
[17:15:51] <robertmaxrees> and  ok
[17:15:52] <robertmaxrees> [2014:10:15:17:14:59] * goodenough (~goodenoug@pool-108-13-13-188.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) has joined #jquery
[17:15:52] <robertmaxrees> [2014:10:15:17:15:37] * Turaylon (
[17:15:53] <robertmaxrees> woops
[17:15:55] <robertmaxrees> $('#form-buttons').on('click', '#add', (function(e) { this
[17:16:03] <robertmaxrees> will never work - you odn't have a #form-buttons on there.
[17:18:26] <hExDJ_> hold on, I have it on my local copy
[17:18:34] <hExDJ_> but it didn't update on my bin
[17:21:24] <hExDJ_> awesome, it works
[17:21:30] <hExDJ_> thanks robertmaxrees
[17:21:33] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[17:28:47] <hExDJ_> heres' the fixed version: http://jsbin.com/yajacarohuni/1/
[17:29:04] <robertmaxrees> nice.
[17:30:30] <jbrhbr> robertmaxrees: so do i have to type my q again or can we continue here? :)
[17:30:37] <robertmaxrees> jbrhbr lol i'll give you a pass.
[17:30:49] <robertmaxrees> you want to post something and then send them to the clicked URL, right?
[17:31:02] <jbrhbr> for some reason i'm having difficulty explaining this clearly
[17:31:23] <jbrhbr> but it's not "send them to the clicked URL". the data at the URL is dynamically generated based on the POST submission
[17:31:41] <jbrhbr> so you know how a normal POST form submits a bunch of stuff and then sends you to the resultant page? this is what i want to do
[17:31:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:31:44] <jbrhbr> but, i have no form
[17:31:45] <robertmaxrees> then why not use a GET.
[17:32:01] <jbrhbr> because i'm trying to send a pretty big chunk of data
[17:32:19] <jbrhbr> and i don't want a 1000 character URL, if that's even RFC valid
[17:32:57] <jbrhbr> i can tell you exactly what i'm doing if more context would clarify things
[17:33:03] <jbrhbr> do you use bitbucket or github?
[17:33:21] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle is usually preferred.
[17:33:54] <jbrhbr> wrong implied interpretation
[17:34:04] <jbrhbr> i'm doing dom manipulation with a chrome extension on bitbucket pull requests
[17:34:24] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:34:29] <robertmaxrees> i don't want all of your code.
[17:34:36] <jbrhbr> i'm inserting a button like "share this" in the replies
[17:34:43] <robertmaxrees> i want a reduced test case for the specific problem you're having.
[17:35:02] <jbrhbr> i'm just explaining the behavior, not pasting code
[17:35:11] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:35:27] <jbrhbr> so you're with me on visualizing the button that i've inserted into the reply
[17:35:38] <robertmaxrees> lol really wish i could see some code.
[17:35:40] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[17:36:50] <jbrhbr> you know how sometimes people write really cool replies to stuff? and how that knowledge basically dies with that particular pull request
[17:37:09] <thecoolguy> i'm trying to bind a function to a click event
[17:37:14] <thecoolguy> how do i pass parameters ?
[17:37:20] <robertmaxrees> jbrhbr erm, yeah.  could you just provide a small example of the particular thing though?
[17:37:22] <jbrhbr> so the idea is, let's share that comment on a wiki or something (confluence in my case) so we can save it for all to benefit
[17:37:32] <robertmaxrees> thecoolguy .call() or .bind() depends one what you're doing.
[17:37:56] <thecoolguy> right now i'm doing .click(functionname)
[17:38:03] <thecoolguy> but i want to include parameters
[17:38:16] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:38:36] <jbrhbr> robertmaxrees: i'm not sure what would be most useful for you to see, i'm not trying to hide code, it's just not relevant at this point in the description. perhaps i'm being too verbose
[17:38:41] <robertmaxrees> you can pass extra data, thecoolguy
[17:39:00] <jbrhbr> but regardless, when i try to click my inserted "Share this" button, i want it to basically create a templatized wiki page
[17:39:21] <jbrhbr> making an A element and giving it an href works fine if my query string was short since i can just window.open() that
[17:39:37] <thecoolguy> how would i do that ? if i do .click(functionname(parameter)) it just calls the function
[17:39:49] <robertmaxrees> thecoolguy use .on(), not .click()
[17:39:52] <robertmaxrees> and read the docs.
[17:39:53] <hExDJ_> is there a way to prevent inputs from remembering values that have been given before?
[17:40:26] <thecoolguy> robertmaxrees i did read the docs and i taught it would be possible with click
[17:40:42] <robertmaxrees> thecoolguy so read the docs for .on()
[17:41:12] <hExDJ_> nvm, think I found it
[17:42:03] <jbrhbr> or i could just ask my context-less initial question again… how can i get the behavior of submit() (posts data to some page and opens it) without having to procedurally generate a form to submit on?
[17:42:40] <robertmaxrees> without doing AJAX, you can't afaik
[17:44:16] <jbrhbr> ajax would let me do that then? (i don't know)
[17:46:51] <robertmaxrees> jbrhbr only if the other end accepts it.
[17:47:24] <jbrhbr> ok, thanks
[17:53:57] <Unopoo> I'm using localStorage to store a array like this: [{"id":"1","title":"title1","content","content1"}...]
[17:53:57] <Unopoo> now I parsed it , but how could I go and edit a specific object's value, like the object that its id is 1?
[17:54:51] <Unopoo> I'm using JSON.stringify() to serialize the json string, and $.parseJSON to parse the json
[17:55:19] <__joshua__> var obj = JSON.parse(things).find({id: 1})
[17:55:46] <__joshua__> oops, seems i made find up
[17:56:21] <Unopoo> __joshua__: so find is not recommend?
[17:56:28] <Unopoo> anyway, thank you
[17:56:37] <__joshua__> [{id:2}, {id:1}].filter(function(x){ return x.id==1 })[0]
[17:58:54] <Doxin> so using $(foo).trigger(blah) doesn't set this correctly. is there some way I can fix that>
[17:58:55] <Doxin> ?
[17:59:31] <Ansikt> Doxin - use jQuery.proxy
[18:00:13] <Unopoo> __joshua__: work like charm :)
[18:01:00] <Unopoo> do you know some useful link about jquery's best practice? I really should learn what's a better way to do the same thing, now, I figure
[18:01:37] <Ansikt> Unopoo, http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[18:03:46] <Doxin> Ansikt: how do I?
[18:04:01] <Doxin> Ansikt: I dont understand the docs on that one
[18:06:06] <trending> So, I have this problem : When I add a new form the "current" checkbox doens't work on the new ones only on the original one that was loaded with the page. Any thoughts please ? http://jsfiddle.net/medotte/m7kb94LL/
[18:06:23] <trending> I know it needs an event handler but I don't know how to implement it
[18:06:24] <trending> Thank you
[18:08:27] <Ansikt> Doxin - jQuery overrides the scoping of the `this` keyword.  You can bind a function to the current `this` scope by doing something like: this.hello = "hi!"; $(foo).on(blah, $.proxy(function(){alert(this.hello);}, this)).trigger(blah);
[18:08:40] <Ansikt> Unless I'm misunderstanding your problem.  A bit more detail would help
[18:08:49] <Doxin> oh
[18:08:50] <Doxin> ah
[18:08:51] <Doxin> hm
[18:08:55] * Doxin contemplates
[18:09:18] <Doxin> so you need the proxy on the receiving side
[18:09:19] <Doxin> weird
[18:10:01] <Unopoo> __joshua__: now I edited the specific item, could I just update localStorage's corresponding item to this edited version or should I update the whold localStorage?
[18:11:34] <Ansikt> Doxin: I think so.  Was that the problem you were trying to solve - that you had this scope outside of the handler which you were trying to preserve?
[18:11:36] <__joshua__> no, you have to write the whole thing back
[18:11:47] <Doxin> Ansikt: I was triggering a custom event
[18:11:52] <Doxin> Ansikt: and stuff broke
[18:12:01] <Doxin> Ansikt: and this wasn't what I expected which is why stuff broke
[18:12:04] <__joshua__> when you JSON.parse and are creating an object from a string.  they are disconnected from each other
[18:12:54] <__joshua__> var x = {};  x === x;  JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(x)) !== x;
[18:13:00] <Ansikt> trending: http://jsfiddle.net/m7kb94LL/1/
[18:13:42] <Ansikt> Doxin, if you paste a code snippet, I'll have a better chance of being able to help you.
[18:14:23] <Doxin> Ansikt: it's bedtime for me I'm afraid
[18:14:24] <trending> Ansikt: oh, thanks a lot !!
[18:14:26] <Doxin> I'll be back!
[18:14:41] <Ansikt> Doxin - alright man, see ya
[18:14:51] <Ansikt> trending: :D
[18:40:49] <acidjazz> hey every1.. got a very common css/js animation issue.. basically i have 10 divs on top of each other.. i am only showing 1 at a time and using opacity 1/0 w/ css transitions to have it fade in nicely, but since theyre all display: block only the top 1 is clickable, the rest are under.. but if i switch to display block/none i lose my css transitioning.. any ideal suggestions?
[18:43:15] <thecoolguy> if i do $("#test").click(func); it only attached to the first element it finds. why is that ?
[18:43:25] <thecoolguy> doc says it should attach to all
[18:45:11] <thecoolguy> actually i'm using on
[18:45:25] <jeffreylevesque> is there an easy way to validate form uploaded files in jquery - to ensure they are 'application/text', or csv files?
[18:48:26] <Ansikt> sort of - you can validate the extension.
[18:48:43] <jeffreylevesque> i just found a cool project - http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[18:48:43] <Ansikt> But as far as I know, you can't check the MIME type.  Someone smarter than me can correct me though.
[18:48:54] <shoky> thecoolguy: because ID's must be unique. use a class instead
[18:49:01] <jeffreylevesque> ya, that would be difficult i think
[18:50:44] <jeffreylevesque> I'm checking their demo
[18:50:56] <jeffreylevesque> http://jqueryvalidation.org/files/demo/
[18:50:59] <jeffreylevesque> seems cool
[18:51:13] <islalobo> dumbed down version of what I'm trying to do, basically addClass on click and them be able to remove it, either on dbclick or some other form: http://jsfiddle.net/ytv1jz0t/1/
[18:51:14] <jeffreylevesque> but, how is jeffrey@gmail, a valid email?
[18:51:16] <thecoolguy> thanks shoky
[18:51:51] <jeffreylevesque> doesn't a valid email require '.com', '.edu', ...
[18:52:46] <Ansikt> jeffreylevesque, The rules for an email are surprisingly lax.  Not only that, but they're selling a ton of new TLDs to companies.
[18:53:00] <Unopoo> Does .filter() always return an array?
[18:53:12] <Unopoo> Even if there is only one item match?
[18:53:23] <Ansikt> I know for a fact, for example, that Apple is buying the .apple domain, so it's totally possible that you could someday be jeffery@apple
[18:54:21] <Ansikt> Unopoo, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[19:00:15] <thecoolguy> so when you do things in animate you have undo them O.o ?
[19:02:09] <thecoolguy> i taught everything in animate() we temperary until it terminated
[19:10:22] <kevireilly> thecoolguy: nopers, it animates to the new values and leaves them that way. You can cache the original styles and restore them using the `css` method
[19:15:01] <Ansikt> thecoolguy, A CSS animation works that way.
[19:15:10] <Ansikt> But not jQuery ones.
[19:16:49] <cardguy1000_> When using $.ajax I’m trying to understand what causes the sucess to raise.  Does this have anything to do with the payload, so for example if the response has a Database error and you’d like to return a failure do you do this via data.myBoolean?
[19:17:11] <cardguy1000_> whereby success is soley 200 ok?
[19:39:54] <Horacsio> Hi I need to add a second id here: $('#about_resume_what_baannng_did').perfectScrollbar({
[19:45:01] <hExDJ_> ids are unique
[19:45:35] <Horacsio> I have to id’s where to apply this function
[19:46:15] <hExDJ_> I have no idea what you're trying to do
[19:46:17] <hExDJ_> so...
[19:46:18] <Horacsio> Hi I need to add a second id here: $('#about_resume_what_baannng_did' . ‘#secondid’).perfectScrollbar({
[19:47:12] <Horacsio> hExDJ_ I need to apply this jquery plugin to several divs.
[19:47:48] <Horacsio> do you get it?
[19:49:43] <Horacsio> http://pastebin.com/9mUuCJ7Y
[19:51:54] <hExDJ_> it would be easier if you use jsbin or something like that
[19:52:05] <hExDJ_> because I can't see on pastebin what your code does
[19:52:35] <Horacsio> it doesnt matter what it does :D I need to apply it to 2 divs
[19:53:26] <hExDJ_> ok, so my guess would be :
[19:53:27] <hExDJ_> http://jsbin.com/hihiqu/1/
[19:53:36] <hExDJ_> if that doesn't do it, I have no clue
[19:54:46] <Horacsio> well that was the way I used :) isn’t tthere a way to join that?!
[19:56:16] <hExDJ_> does the perfecScrollbar work for at least one of the items?
[20:03:21] <snufft_> hi guys!
[20:04:43] <Horacsio> yes it works correctly :)
[20:05:04] <snufft_> i've got a really newb question, how do I access the json of an XHR? i have a variable with a couple of XHR objects in it and I'd like to grab a property called "command" from the second object. is it just something like resultVariable[1].command ? because that's not giving me any joy :(
[20:05:33] <Horacsio> do I need a rotation plugin to rotate a div?
[20:08:35] <jotterbot> hey guys, is there some way to force a filename for a download link? I have tried using download="filename.ext" attribute, but doesn't seem to work. Can jquery "force" the headers and filename of a url download?
[20:22:08] <__joshua__> the server can respond with   content_disposition='attachment; filename=
[20:22:18] <__joshua__> in its headers
[20:23:07] <Zak> how do you get a copy of a jquery wrapped object?
[20:24:54] <Zak> I want to create a "copy", so that the object reference isn't identical
[20:25:16] <Zak> >> var $o = $('body'); $o === $o;
[20:27:43] <dopie> hey all
[20:28:10] <dopie> im trying to get auto tab to work
[20:28:12] <dopie> https://github.com/mathachew/jquery-autotab/
[20:28:31] <dopie> i put this $('.phone').autotab('phone');
[20:28:31] <dopie>  in my js expecting it will do something
[20:28:35] <dopie> but i fail miserably
[20:28:37] <dopie> what am i doing wrong?
[20:31:47] <jotterbot> __joshua__: that would be set in php ? so i guess i have to have a button on click submit url and "filename" to a php script?
[20:33:21] <__joshua__> yeah.  is the file itself coming from the server?
[20:34:25] <jotterbot> nope
[20:34:35] <jotterbot> basically i am just pointing the user at youtube servers
[20:35:10] <jotterbot> so i have the url and the filename i want. I just need php/jquery/"something" to "force" that name
[20:35:34] <jotterbot> it's sounding like something like an ajax request to a php handler to force a name. just researching....
[20:36:06] <__joshua__> well, you can download directly from browser with a modern browser
[20:37:08] <__joshua__> https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js
[20:37:56] <snufft_> i've got a problem where my .animate(scrollTop.  is running multiple times for each xhr returned. if i set .once.animate, it only loads once for that page load, instead of once per xhr rturned. is there a way to make .animate run once per xhr return?
[20:38:09] <jotterbot> cheers, i'll have a look
[20:38:52] <__joshua__> $.ajax(someurl).then(function(){ triggeranimation });
[20:39:18] <__joshua__> but in reality snufft_, there is no way to give you help without more context
[20:40:17] <snufft_> __joshua__: thanks for the reply :) i'll have a play around and see what else i can do. it's a bit hard to pull out a jsfiddle for this one :(
[20:52:46] <neybar_> any idea why when I addClass('foo', 1000, 'easeInBounce'), I get a nifty animation, but when I removeClass('foo', 1000, 'easeInBounce') my element just appears?  The foo class is just { left: 9999px }
[21:16:18] <P0rk> are there any better/preferred ui-skinning systems when compared to jqueryUI?
[21:17:37] <doug_> neybar: what addon is providing that?
[21:17:48] <neybar> jqueryui
[21:23:35] <doug_> neybar: this should work http://jsfiddle.net/cvzjahaj/1/    but doesn't
[21:28:23] <shoky> doug_: http://jsfiddle.net/cvzjahaj/2/
[21:29:06] <doug_> shoky: doh! of course
[21:29:09] <doug_> thanks
[21:29:19] <doug_> I put position: relative in foo
[21:29:44] <shoky> yop
[21:30:06] <doug_> neybar: http://jsfiddle.net/cvzjahaj/4/
[21:30:14] <shoky> and
[21:30:33] <shoky> heh i did it another way:  http://jsfiddle.net/cvzjahaj/5/
[21:30:43] <shoky> (just added the left:0)
[21:31:04] <neybar> yeah, I'm not sure why mine is only doing the animation when it removes.
[21:31:40] <doug_> neybar: can you show more code?
[21:32:01] <neybar> heh, I was working on my own fiddle, but I can't duplicate it.
[21:32:02] <neybar> sigh
[21:32:16] <neybar> some dueling css rule I suspect
[21:32:19] <shoky> neybar: make the non-classed element have the explicit css property you want it to return to
[21:32:30] <shoky> like in my last fiddle
[21:41:21] <z1haze> can someone please help me with an uncaught typerror? im trying to use bootstrap datetimepicker and the time link is giving me errors
[21:41:31] <z1haze> http://dev.hendricksweb.com/smalljobs/serverreports/edit_report.php?edit=1 you can try here, the date works but when u click the click for time it breaks
[21:42:29] <Uhkis> "expanded.collapse is not a function"
[21:43:17] <doug_> neybar: http://jsfiddle.net/cvzjahaj/6/
[21:43:31] <doug_> perhaps another class causes it to snap left like when hold left is checked
[21:45:00] <doug_> neybar: your scenario is like when you add then wait then starting there, when you remove foo it snaps left?
[21:45:02] <Uhkis> z1haze: you might be missing some includes
[21:45:16] <z1haze> yea i figured it out
[21:47:08] <neybar> I've actually abandoned my original take on it.  I'm animating a parent and it seems to be working.  But with what I had before, it would ultimately move off the screen just fine.  It just that in one direction it would animate smoothly, and the other it would just snap out of view.
[21:48:57] <doug_> neybar: http://jsfiddle.net/cvzjahaj/7/   try the button
[21:49:48] <doug_> neybar: am I off track or is that something like your issue?
[21:53:06] <neybar> hmm, not really.  The holding isn't what was happening.  When the class was added, it would instantly go to the left, but when removed then it would animate back to the right.
[21:55:52] <doug_> neybar: http://jsfiddle.net/cvzjahaj/10/
[21:56:16] <doug_> the !important causes it to malfunction
[21:58:05] <neybar> that is pretty much the behavior.  I'll have to dig through and see if there is an important hiding some where.
[22:46:01] <nobs> -quit
[22:59:08] <qyrie> hi any jade experts here
[22:59:09] <qyrie> ?
[23:09:10] <doug_> qyrie: ask please
[23:19:44] <Kartagis> doug_: here is my scenario: there are two pages. one of them has the categories and associated prices. the other has two selects consisting of these categories. the user never gets to page one. is there any way for me to fetch these prices based on the categorier I select on page 2, from page 1, with jquery?
[23:20:05] <qyrie> doug_: thanks, what is the script that we use in a jade while with a "-" mean
[23:20:07] <qyrie> ?
[23:20:19] <qyrie> i cannot see that in the html page generated
[23:20:44] <qyrie> is it a server side script
[23:20:45] <qyrie> ?
[23:20:49] <larsemil> http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/ check console. How do i get first url in each of the data('interchange');
[23:21:58] <doug_> qyrie: lines that begin with - are javascript
[23:22:57] <doug_> qyrie: http://jade-lang.com/reference/iteration/
[23:24:33] <doug_> Kartagis: yes, within the same domain you can fetch the other page with ajax
[23:25:13] <Kartagis> doug_: any example you can point me to?
[23:33:10] <larsemil> noone?
[23:33:13] <larsemil> http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/ check console. How do i get first url in each of the data('interchange');
[23:37:09] <Cork> larsemil: always define your variables
[23:37:17] <Cork> don't use globals
[23:38:15] <Cork> larsemil: but what is the question?
[23:39:12] <larsemil> i want to get the url from the string i get as a return.
[23:39:14] <larsemil> see here:
[23:39:19] <larsemil> http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/1/
[23:39:53] <Cork> larsemil: can you change the format of what is in the attribute?
[23:39:57] <larsemil> no
[23:40:03] <Cork> ugg
[23:40:07] <larsemil> yes.. :)
[23:40:12] <Cork> well then regex is your only choice
[23:40:24] <Cork> why they didn't choose json is beyond me
[23:41:20] <Cork> larsemil: .match(/\[([^,]+),([^\]]+)\]/)
[23:43:20] <doug_> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/1s8bxqrt/5/
[23:44:10] <larsemil> Cork: not working. or am i doing it wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/2/
[23:46:21] <Cork> don't use .data
[23:46:30] <larsemil> why?
[23:46:32] <Cork> as you have to treat it as a string .data will mess things up
[23:46:37] <Cork> cause the content is broken
[23:46:50] <Cork> .data will try to parse it as json
[23:47:00] <larsemil> i get the same using .attr
[23:47:23] <Cork> hmm
[23:47:33] <Cork> .data might be clever enough to see thqat
[23:47:34] <Cork> that
[23:48:33] <larsemil> its the .match i dont get to work
[23:49:54] <larsemil> hahahaha this one worked.
[23:49:55] <larsemil> http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/3/
[23:51:27] <doug_> larsemil: fix the problem, not the symptoms. can you format the data attribute any better? you only need space delimiters for urls
[23:51:55] <larsemil> doug_: i cannot. it is fetched from other site.
[23:53:05] <doug_> why not use simply \[\s*([^\]]+)\s* to match the urls
[23:53:19] <larsemil> did not get it to work
[23:53:20] <ThKo> Good morning, short question: If I have the following call: tx.executeSql( query , [] , successCB , errorCB ); is it possible to say „var return = tx.executeSql( query , [] , successCB , errorCB );“? My goal is to get the results in the same function where I make the tx.executeSql…Thanks a lot :)
[23:53:43] <doug_> larsemil: ah, that comma stuff
[23:54:41] <Cork> larsemil: http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/4/
[23:54:55] <larsemil> Cork: cool thanks
[23:55:53] <Cork> one could do it all in once go with .exec
[23:57:50] <Cork> larsemil: http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/8/
[23:58:05] <larsemil> Cork: <3
[23:58:54] <doug_> larsemil: http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/9/
[23:59:00] <Cork> larsemil: if you want the second url in the link run .exec again
[23:59:02] <andcs> I am using JQuery Mobile for a menu, I'm trying to use normal links, that redirects to another page. I'm using data-ajax="false", but still no effect. Is there a solution for using a normal url with redirect?
[23:59:20] <larsemil> cork doug http://jsfiddle.net/709hbob1/7/
[23:59:25] <doug_> Cork: lol, almost identical
[23:59:32] <Cork> doug_: yup
