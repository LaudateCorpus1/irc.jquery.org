[01:18:37] <ezio> $.get('https://www.londontransit.ca/plan-a-trip/routes-schedules/'); throws an error
[01:18:52] <ezio> net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID
[01:36:31] <Cork> ezio: it just means the cert is invalid
[01:36:41] <Cork> ezio: also it is the browser throwing the error not $.get
[01:37:19] <Cork> you have two options, try using http://, and contact the site about the invalid cert
[01:37:29] <ezio> Bloody hell that's not the error
[01:37:57] <Cork> ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID means the site precents a cert that is for a different domain
[01:38:58] <Cork> and it is the exact same error i get here
[01:39:02] <Cork> it uses a cert for realtime.londontransit.ca
[01:39:05] <ezio> Thanks for pointing that out.  Take out the s from http.  That was just my attempt to see if I could fix this error: jquery.js:9600 Mixed Content: The page at 'https://localhost:5001/BusRoutes/Utilities' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://www.londontransit.ca/plan-a-trip/routes-schedules/'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
[01:39:41] <Cork> and that means you try to get js from an http connection when your in https, and the browser blocks you
[01:40:39] <ezio> Yeah.  Is there any way I can do stop that.  Even a browser plugin.  I'm just writing a simple script.  Don't care about the prettiness.
[01:40:57] <Cork> contact the resource provider and have them provide a valid cert
[01:41:21] <Cork> you can change the broweser configuration to allow mixed content, but all browsers now days has it blocked by default
[01:41:25] <Cork> and a site can't control that
[01:41:50] <ezio> gonna use an http client on the server
[01:41:53] <Cork> you are executing code on the visitors machine though
[01:41:54] <ezio> Thanks
[01:42:10] <Cork> ezio: no, if anything fetch and store the content
[01:42:30] <Cork> make sure it is the correct data and then you can serve it safly over https
[01:42:44] <Cork> if you just make a http proxy, it is just as insecure as the current solution
[01:43:28] <Cork> (or just switch your site to not use https, cause the data isn't secure anyway)
[01:43:43] <ezio> Too much effort.
[01:43:59] <Cork> ....
[01:44:08] <Cork> then get someone who knows what they do to fix your problem...
[01:44:22] <Cork> cause you are just making your visitors insecure
[01:46:26] <ezio> I just did fix it.  As I said before, I'm just scripting. I will have no visitors.
[09:43:21] <codecutter> i have 2 visible buttons with class .positive-btn and .negative-btn (respectively) and 3 hidden radio buttons with same group 'sentiment' - two of which have the with values (positive and negative)  and share the same class as the buttons (.positive-btn and .negative-btn), third input has value 'neutral' (does not have a visible button twin). When either one of the visible button is active (toggled on/off) i need its
[09:43:21] <codecutter>  hidden sibling to toggle on/off (radio button behaviour) if neither one of the buttons are on then default is neutral button would be on. What would be the best with to achieve this behaviour with jquery? https://pastebin.com/g79VTdxh
[09:44:35] <codecutter>  two of which have value*
[09:46:30] <codecutter> Cork ^
[09:53:14] <thykka> codecutter, those "buttons" look like links to me.. but also, why do you need the buttons when radios already provide radio button functionality?
[09:53:45] <codecutter> links styled as btns
[09:53:50] <thykka> which is wrong
[09:54:06] <codecutter> i will change it to divs
[09:54:51] <codecutter> can i make a radio btn look like a btn?
[09:55:11] <thykka> no, but radio buttons can have labels, which in turn can be styled to look like anything you'd need
[09:55:37] <codecutter> ah
[09:55:56] <thykka> ..and clicking a label that's been associated with an input, activates said input â€“ no javascript requiresd
[09:56:02] <thykka> s/requiresd/required
[09:56:53] <codecutter> if i have 2 buttons then how i select the neutral which not visible
[09:57:08] <codecutter> how do*
[09:57:22] <thykka> how would you have done it with buttons?
[09:57:43] <thykka> and why is it not visible, if it's a choice?
[09:57:49] <codecutter> when no buttons have class 'on'
[09:58:12] <codecutter> i think i see
[09:58:12] <thykka> ..and how can that happen, if this is supposed to act like a radio?
[09:58:48] <codecutter> go on...
[09:59:05] <thykka> i think you might be confusing radio-behavior with checkbox-behavior.. not a good idea in terms of UX
[09:59:39] <thykka> radio buttons -> Pick one, and only one, checkbox -> pick as many as you want, if you want
[09:59:51] <codecutter> brb
[10:00:29] <thykka> what you're describing is a weird mutant kid, that does the radio-thing mostly, but then also allows unchecking the selected option to conjure a 3rd, partially hidden state.
[10:01:45] <thykka> so.. why is the third state hidden, instead of having it's own explicit radio button?
[10:01:59] <thykka> do you not want the user to find it? :-)
[10:09:15] <codecutter> thykka form field has a property called sentiment, which has state 'neutral', 'positive' or 'negative'. for aesthetic there is only 2 buttons 'positive' and 'negative', if neither is on then it is in neutral by default
[10:09:20] <codecutter> make sense?
[10:10:20] <Cork> codecutter: i would make that a hidden field
[10:10:47] <codecutter> it is hidden
[10:11:11] <codecutter> scroll up
[10:11:45] <Cork> no i meant a <input type="hidden"
[10:11:56] <codecutter> then?
[10:12:05] <thykka> why allow an option that doesn't follow the UI-conventions for the other choices?
[10:12:20] <thykka> "for aesthetic" is not a valid reason
[10:12:35] <thykka> it's implicit, and confusing
[10:13:11] <Cork> codecutter: <input type="hidden" name="sentiment" value="Neutral"><input type="radio" name="sentiment" value="Positive"><input type="radio" name="sentiment" value="Negative">
[10:13:34] <Cork> that way untill one of the two radio options has been choosen then choosen answer is neuteral
[10:14:03] <thykka> you can have radios with nothing initially selected
[10:14:18] * Cork nods
[10:14:52] <codecutter> Cork: so when one of the radio buttons is select i use jq to uncheck/check neutral?
[10:15:00] <Cork> no
[10:15:00] <codecutter> selected*
[10:15:03] <Cork> you don't need to touch it
[10:15:22] <Cork> as the option has the same name it will be overwritten in the data stream server side
[10:15:28] <Cork> it is how form checkboxes works for example
[10:15:40] <codecutter> aha!!
[10:15:57] <Cork> <input type="hidden" name="agree" value="0"><input type="checkbox" name="agree" value="1" checked>
[10:16:19] <Cork> will send agree=0&agree=1 resulting in agree == 1
[10:16:40] <Cork> and <input type="hidden" name="agree" value="0"><input type="checkbox" name="agree" value="1">
[10:16:46] <Cork> will just send agree=0
[10:16:48] <codecutter> what is positive/negaivt is selected then unselected (e.g. toggles on/off)?
[10:16:53] <codecutter> what if*
[10:17:04] <Cork> codecutter: if you want toggle then it isn't a radio option
[10:17:06] <thykka> then it's no longer a radio
[10:17:25] <thykka> then you're mixing more than one UI concept, and that's not good form
[10:17:43] <codecutter> because a user can select positive/negative then unselect it if they change they mind
[10:17:53] <codecutter> their*
[10:17:55] <Cork> codecutter: if you want to have neuteral as a chosable option for the user (go back to) then you need to have it as an ui element for radio
[10:18:16] <codecutter> but can not do that behind the scenes?
[10:18:20] <codecutter> can i*
[10:18:26] <codecutter> with jquery
[10:18:35] <thykka> https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/pbvx23wq/3/
[10:18:36] <Cork> codecutter: you will create a broken radio button
[10:18:39] <thykka> do this^
[10:18:58] <thykka> there are three choices, so there should be three radios. don't try to be too smart about it
[10:19:02] * Cork agrees
[10:19:13] <undefined_bob> or an unselect/reset button?
[10:19:18] <Cork> you can make a radio button be as a checkbox too
[10:19:24] <Cork> or a checkbox work like a radio
[10:19:32] <Cork> but you are effectly creating a broken form
[10:19:32] <codecutter> neutral cannot be visible it part of the ui design
[10:19:36] <thykka> why unselect/reset, if it's function is to select the third option?
[10:19:46] <thykka> codecutter, then how can it be an option?
[10:20:29] <thykka> it has to be visible somehow, in order for the user to recognize the state. Having radios that can be toggled off, is not making the third option invisible, just hard to find
[10:21:17] <undefined_bob> thykka: I think its not really an option but more like the default state if no radio is selected. So when a user select one choice and then change his mind, the radio should be de-select able and then it must be the neutral state again
[10:21:39] <codecutter> right!
[10:21:40] <thykka> in this case, it has a well-defined value besides [nothing selected]
[10:22:04] <thykka> it's meaning is "neutral" which isn't equal to [no choice]
[10:22:08] <thykka> right?
[10:22:24] <codecutter> neutral == no choice
[10:22:39] <thykka> i disagree, but it's your funeral.
[10:23:16] <thykka> if you want to go making your AND your users' lives difficult, the by all means do so :-)
[10:23:41] <thykka> for aesthetic reasons, right?
[10:23:44] <codecutter> i think checkbox is more appropriate here, i'm using neutral as a filler
[10:23:47] <undefined_bob> but all that sounds for me like checkboxes would fit better
[10:24:07] <Cork> or a slider
[10:24:17] <thykka> checkboxes imply more than one selectable state, i doubt that was allowed here
[10:24:33] <Cork> then you can have two labels and a middle point
[10:24:40] <Cork> (lableless)
[10:24:45] <thykka> a slider would fit the use-case, even if it does feel a bit weird
[10:25:09] <Cork> a bit but i've seen it in plenty of questionary forms
[10:25:20] <thykka> but a slider is just a bunch of radios, so idk why not simply use three radios
[10:25:40] <undefined_bob> thykka: how? you just have to make sure that the user can only select one of the two choices or none
[10:25:47] <thykka> that's three choices.
[10:25:54] <Cork> only point is you would have to make the middle point more explicit with radios
[10:26:05] <thykka> 1: positive 2: negative 3: "none"
[10:26:10] <codecutter> Cork slider is exactly what i need
[10:26:11] <Cork> though that said if you remove the label for the middle one ...
[10:26:22] <undefined_bob> thykka: same with radios
[10:26:25] <codecutter> neutral == none
[10:26:28] <codecutter> yep
[10:26:41] <Cork> codecutter: it exists as an input type
[10:26:56] <codecutter> i can hide the middle (neutral)
[10:27:02] <thykka> if you count those, you'll notice there are three of them. Why exactly you want to hide the third one while still making it as an available options, beats me..
[10:27:20] <Cork> ya
[10:27:33] <codecutter> hard to ignore thykka is saying
[10:27:45] <codecutter> ok
[10:27:46] <Cork> especially as you will have to make a none standard action to activate it; cause you hide it
[10:27:50] <codecutter> let me rehrase
[10:27:53] <undefined_bob> thykka: I think because the user (should) not know that neutral is an option
[10:27:59] <thykka> it's like you were in a bar, and you were offered wine or beer, but if only if you first choose beer, and then UNCHOOSE beer, can you have the secret Whiskey
[10:28:09] <Cork> undefined_bob: then why should he be able to choose it?
[10:28:11] <thykka> undefined_bob, then why IS it an option?
[10:28:22] <undefined_bob> the user should not choose it
[10:28:35] <Cork> if it is a "you haven't chosen anything" then just make it a type hidden field
[10:28:45] <Cork> undefined_bob: no, that is actaully a requirement
[10:29:11] <codecutter> here is what i need. A users can select either 'A' or 'B' or None
[10:29:22] <thykka> 3 options -> 3 radios.
[10:29:26] <codecutter> thats sounds like a checkbox but with checkbox they can select both
[10:29:26] * Cork nods
[10:29:43] <thykka> doesn't sound like a checkbox at all, otherwise they could choose A AND B
[10:30:01] <Cork> it sounds like 3 radios or one select element
[10:30:15] <Cork> but as you have 3 options the user need to see 3 options
[10:30:24] <undefined_bob> but its possible to disable the not checked checkbox
[10:30:30] <Cork> not 2 and a third you can activate by doing hand waving
[10:30:43] <thykka> juse because it's possible, doesn't mean it's the right/smart thing to do
[10:30:50] <undefined_bob> correct
[10:31:07] <undefined_bob> but I think I understand what/why he wants
[10:31:21] <codecutter> i can have two options A or b and use js behind the scences so if A is selected B is unselected etc..
[10:31:35] <codecutter> right?
[10:31:40] <Cork> but that is a radio
[10:31:50] <Cork> not a checkbox
[10:32:05] <undefined_bob> but its possible with checkboxes too afaik
[10:32:10] <codecutter> if neither is selected then sentiment value will be set noeutral
[10:32:18] <thykka> it seems like they're determined to do this wrong, just step back people :P
[10:32:46] <Cork> codecutter: disabling one when the other is checked so you get a "can only choose one at a time" is _acceptable_
[10:32:55] <Cork> unchecking on when the other one is checked is not
[10:33:10] <Cork> that is by definition a broken ui
[10:33:58] <Robdgreat> that just sounds like a radio with extra steps
[10:34:04] <codecutter> instead on unchecking i can disable. Thats just symantics...
[10:34:24] <Cork> codecutter: except you don't magically change the users choice
[10:34:34] <Cork> you just limit what choise they have after the last choice
[10:35:37] <thykka> codecutter, it's not "just semantics", there are certain conventions people are used to, and around which tools have been built.
[10:36:15] <Cork> also ppl who can't see actually depends on that the type values of input fields to understand what is there
[10:36:17] <thykka> when you start mixing those up and inventing your own solutions, you're flipping the bird to conventions, and making life slightly more difficult for everyone
[10:36:44] <Robdgreat> much more difficult for some
[10:36:47] <Cork> if you change how the element work, they will be locked out
[10:36:51] <Robdgreat> "what accessibility?"
[10:37:30] <thykka> all of this for some magical notion of "aesthetics", which has no basis on real-world facts
[10:38:11] <Robdgreat> you'd be better off styling an actual radio
[10:39:24] <Cork> robertparkerx: except he doesn't want the third state to be a visible thing
[10:39:35] <Cork> so my recommendation is https://jsfiddle.net/j3p9skwe/
[10:39:56] <Cork> it is the closest you can get where the form field is still behaving as it should
[10:40:38] <Cork> even though it irks me quite a bit...
[10:41:31] <undefined_bob> nice Cork
[10:42:39] <codecutter> Cork: if 'A' is check then I have to uncheck A to check B (becuase its disabled), anyway to check B with unchecking A?
[10:43:19] <undefined_bob> no, thats not good
[10:43:29] <undefined_bob> in my opinion
[10:43:43] <thykka> what's not good are the requirements
[10:43:51] <undefined_bob> lol mean
[10:43:58] <thykka> they need to change to match reality
[10:44:06] <thykka> three choices -> three radios.
[10:44:28] <thykka> not two choices + hidden choice -> two radios + weird custom stuff
[10:45:03] <undefined_bob> codecutter: and that wont work because then you cant have none selected if it always automatically select the other one
[10:45:15] <codecutter> yea
[10:45:44] <undefined_bob> the way cork did it is exactly what I saw in my mind when I read your question. I think its the best you can get
[10:45:44] <codecutter> i may need to process the form and do a ajax submit instead of then form
[10:46:28] <codecutter> that was i can set the value
[10:47:57] <codecutter> if i process the form then i can check if any of the buttons are active if none, then its neutral
[10:49:48] <codecutter> if A is active then uncheck B and vice versa
[10:50:07] <codecutter> it may be breaking convention but i get what i want
[10:50:15] <codecutter> heck with conventions
[10:50:46] <thykka> *why* is that what you want? out of all the good choices, what lead you to believe that the entirely custom solution is the one you want?
[10:51:10] <thykka> did some designer tell you to do this? or are you playing designer yourself?
[10:51:46] <codecutter> this is getting too academic...
[10:52:13] <thykka> let me talk some sense into them, they are probably just new at their job, and haven't yet found out that design too, should have principles drawn from research :--)
[10:52:33] <codecutter> i rest my case....
[10:53:17] <codecutter> all i need it a 2 buttons, pos or neg, if neither is selected is neutral/none selected
[10:53:27] <codecutter> that can be too complicated
[10:53:29] <codecutter> cant*
[10:53:38] <thykka> it's not complicated, it's wrong
[10:53:46] <codecutter> yet, evidently it spears to be so
[10:53:52] <codecutter> appears*
[10:54:17] <thykka> well, there's no built-in component for that, because it's wrong, so you'll have to go out of your way to forcefully do things wrong
[10:54:26] <thykka> that's the complicated part here
[10:55:13] <thykka> technically, it's a no-brainer
[10:56:48] <codecutter> what do you mean by 'wrong'?
[10:57:10] <codecutter> breaking ui design rules?
[10:57:19] <thykka> I mean that there are repercussions in doing custom stuff like this. You will break expectations, usability, and most likely the code too
[10:57:21] <codecutter> who cares its not a college
[10:57:47] <thykka> everybody cares when they're subject to bad design choices
[10:58:32] <codecutter> how? If I do validation before submiting the, form then I can't see what could go wrong?
[10:58:49] <thykka> validation has nothing to do with this
[10:59:10] <codecutter> bad design is when a user has to uncheck 'a' before slecting 'b'
[10:59:14] <codecutter> thats bad design
[10:59:16] <thykka> right
[10:59:25] <thykka> but that's not where the issue comes from
[11:00:18] <thykka> the real issue is that your specifications state that there are 3 choices, but only 2 should be visible, but the third one should also be selected in an implicit manner. That is almost in contradiction with itself, and certainly not good design.
[11:00:47] <thykka> over-engineering, creating a problem where there shouldn't be one
[11:01:15] <thykka> so the sensible thing to do here, is to discuss the specification, not the implementation details
[11:25:24] <codecutter> this does exactly what i want https://jsfiddle.net/njzdo7p0/
[11:26:32] <thykka> :I
[11:28:02] <codecutter> it does what i'm after, right?
[11:28:26] <robertmaxrees> :|
[11:28:33] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to turn a checkbox into a radio
[11:28:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[11:28:51] <thykka> IKR?
[11:29:16] <thykka> we've been trying to get that information out of codecutter for a while now, but they insist on doing it all wrong
[11:29:28] <robertmaxrees> :/
[11:29:37] <codecutter> becuase that way i get what i want - not display the neutral option
[11:29:49] <thykka> ignoring the important questions, and only sticking to the implementation details
[11:29:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a really confusing user experience.
[11:30:10] <thykka> everyone told that, but apparently they "don't care"
[11:30:25] <codecutter> how? user sees on or off (neutral is not of any concern of the user)
[11:30:26] <robertmaxrees> lol okay okay.
[11:30:30] <codecutter> neutral = none
[11:30:39] <codecutter> go on...
[11:30:41] <robertmaxrees> codecutter becuase users don't expect a checkbox to behave like a radio AND a checkbox
[11:30:57] <robertmaxrees> but meh.  sounds like you're real set on doing it this way.
[11:31:38] <codecutter> users see 2 buttons (no checkboxes or a radio btns)
[11:31:48] <codecutter> labels are styled as buttons
[11:31:54] <codecutter> styled*
[11:32:04] <robertmaxrees> so most users are used to things behaving either as radios or as checkboxes.
[11:32:16] <robertmaxrees> buttons that behave as a combo of both are going to be confusing.
[11:32:21] <robertmaxrees> but hey, what would i know
[11:32:57] <codecutter> yes, what would you know? you have not seen the actual design...
[11:33:03] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[11:33:04] <codecutter> have not*
[11:33:07] <thykka> no no no, codecutter is really smart, and I bet their users are too.. Of course they'll understand this oddball UI right away
[11:33:10] <robertmaxrees> alright duder.  enjoy :)
[11:33:25] <robertmaxrees> thanks thykka  - let's just drop and move on.
[11:33:47] <thykka> the only weird thing about this is why can't they tell the reasoning behind their chosen paths x)
[11:33:58] <robertmaxrees> please just drop it now.  thanks!
[11:33:58] <thykka> falling silent whenever those issues are brought up
[11:34:02] <thykka> i will. bye
[11:35:17] <codecutter> thanks for the input but seriously you guys have not seen the actual designs so you don't how it it ui looks and behaves
[11:35:26] <codecutter> don't be offended by it...
[11:35:32] <robertmaxrees> please just drop it and move on :)
[11:35:33] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[11:35:45] <codecutter> kewl.
[11:36:49] <codecutter> the entire room is against it but I'll roll with it...
[11:36:50] <codecutter> :)
[11:36:54] <codecutter> it works for me
[11:36:55] <robertmaxrees> last time.
[11:37:03] <robertmaxrees> drop it and move on.  thanks.
[11:56:17] <codecutter> how do I add a class foo 'this' and remove class 'boo' from others (one that are to be unchecked)?  https://jsfiddle.net/njzdo7p0/
[11:56:55] <codecutter> add class to active and remove class from inactive
[11:57:04] <codecutter> inactive = unchecked
[11:57:09] <robertmaxrees> do you need the class for some css?
[11:57:23] <codecutter> yes
[11:57:31] <robertmaxrees> why not just use :checked?
[11:57:48] <codecutter> i need to add it to the label
[11:57:56] <codecutter> not the actual input
[11:58:01] <robertmaxrees> fyi lable isn't the right tagname ;)
[11:58:16] <robertmaxrees> and you're almost doing what you want already.
[11:58:20] <codecutter> lable
[11:58:24] <robertmaxrees> label
[11:58:37] <thykka> :checked + label
[11:58:40] <thykka> ...
[11:58:43] <robertmaxrees> if $(':checkbox').not(this) is everything BUT the current input...
[11:58:52] <robertmaxrees> how would you get the current one?
[11:58:53] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:00:42] <codecutter> this adds it to the input (not label) $(':checkbox').not(this).prop('checked', false).addClass('boo');
[12:00:44] <thykka> codecutter, https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/fwakrt2p/2/
[12:00:58] <thykka> i would arrange the HTML like this, instead of putting labels inside inputs..
[12:01:07] <codecutter> kewl
[12:04:12] <robertmaxrees> thykka why do it that way?
[12:04:20] <robertmaxrees> inputs within labels is common
[12:04:29] <thykka> they had labels within inputs
[12:04:37] <thykka> not inputs within labels :P
[12:04:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:04:53] <robertmaxrees> not what i'm seeiung here.
[12:05:22] <thykka> then i'm mistaken.. still, it makes the :checked selector a lot more useful
[12:05:38] <robertmaxrees> except your version relies on implicit ordering of elements :)
[12:05:41] <robertmaxrees> but hey, whatever works.
[12:07:54] <thykka> true, but that's a given with most CSS selectors, unless they adhere to BEM or such.. The way I see it, any alternative would be a chore to implement, and IME the input elements would be hidden anyway, and replaced with something custom..
[12:08:24] <robertmaxrees> if you're not using something like BEM you're doing it wrong imho :)
[12:08:27] <thykka> not the *only* way, just a somewhat nicer way to work with, compared to the options
[12:08:36] <robertmaxrees> it's all good tho.
[12:08:45] <MassDebates> I don't think BEM is an appropriate architecture for all projects.
[12:08:53] <robertmaxrees> not saying it is.
[12:08:54] <thykka> indeed, but BEM doesn't have all the answers, like for pseudo-selectors and such
[12:09:04] <MassDebates> An oversight, to say the least!
[12:09:15] <MassDebates> Smacss can be adhered to pseudos though
[12:09:19] <robertmaxrees> i meant more that you should SOMETHING in place - tachyons, BEMs, etc.
[12:09:27] <robertmaxrees> sure.  just pick something.
[12:09:30] <thykka> not tachyons /D:\
[12:09:43] <MassDebates> I understand that you just meant BEM as an example, robertmaxrees  :)
[12:09:50] <MassDebates> nw
[12:09:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:58:17] <codecutter> thykka by class? https://jsfiddle.net/8jhodfgr/
[12:58:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:59:07] * thykka Parsing error: sentence ended with question mark, yet no question could be inferred
[13:00:33] <codecutter> i'm trying to change the border color by class (not label)
[13:01:16] <robertmaxrees> you mean what you were asking before?
[13:01:21] <codecutter> yea
[13:01:24] <codecutter> ahem ahem
[13:01:32] <robertmaxrees> so go back to what i was saying
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> if $(':checkbox').not(this) is all checkboxes that aren't the current one, how would you get the current one?
[13:02:03] <codecutter> if i could i'd rather do it this way instead of appending a class
[13:02:06] <codecutter> can i do that?
[13:02:18] <robertmaxrees> your question is unclear.
[13:02:30] <codecutter> sorry
[13:02:34] <codecutter> let me explain
[13:06:03] <codecutter> When checkbox A is selected after that if checkbox B is selected, A gets unchecked. I need to remove class (.foo) from A and add  class to B (.boo) during this https://jsfiddle.net/njzdo7p0/
[13:06:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:06:25] <robertmaxrees> so if $(':checkbox').not(this) is all checkboxes that aren't the
[13:06:25] <robertmaxrees> current one, how would you get the current one?
[13:06:38] <codecutter> $(this)?
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:08:54] <codecutter> instead of add a class, I would prefer the approach thykka suggested but I don;'t know why my css is not working https://jsfiddle.net/8jhodfgr/
[13:08:59] <codecutter> adding*
[13:09:12] <robertmaxrees> what about it isn't working?
[13:09:44] <codecutter> click on negative https://jsfiddle.net/8jhodfgr/
[13:09:54] <codecutter> notice there is a now red border
[13:09:59] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[13:10:12] <codecutter> not click on positive, there should be a blue border but its not vissble
