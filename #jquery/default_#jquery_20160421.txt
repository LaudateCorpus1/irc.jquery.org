[00:02:41] <IamTrying> Cork: Guru, after doing nonstop 24 hour of debug here is the conclusion. Google Chrome version above 50 has again broken WebRTC stability. When i used Google Chrome version 46 till 49 it all works perfectly. But since version 50 its WebRTC which is failing when system get idle for a while.
[00:03:06] <IamTrying> FYI.
[01:16:10] <robertparkerx> how do I pass a json_encoded array back through an ajax call once it's been passed through a success
[01:16:24] <robertparkerx> to be passed back to the server-side
[02:44:40] <robertparkerx> how do I pass a php json_encoded array back through an ajax call and back to php
[05:57:04] <alexq> hello i'm trying to find a jquery script that generates a set of inputs based on the values in a hidden text input field: here's a drawing on what i'm looking for: https://www.dropbox.com/s/00lj2qdikv7afeg/vimobiliare_fields.png?dl=0
[05:57:44] <alexq> not sure if there's already something that dose that but it would be pretty useful to me :).
[05:58:32] <alexq> and not sure what should i search on google really :)
[06:11:36] <crockstylie> Hi :)
[06:12:19] <crockstylie> i'm playing with mysql php pdo to save form data. It works. But now, I want to save data with jquery ajax. It doesn't work.
[06:13:12] <crockstylie> I'm not good at debugguing ajax, I don't know how to find out where I have made a mistake ^^"
[06:19:09] <crockstylie> Do I have to unserialize my form serialized data ?
[06:22:49] <Kartagis> crockstylie: save data where?
[06:23:12] <crockstylie> Oh sorry, in a mysql db
[06:23:29] <Kartagis> you mean through a web service?
[06:23:51] <crockstylie> I mean with jquery ajax function ?
[06:24:08] <Kartagis> pastebin your code
[06:24:12] <crockstylie> I use wamp ^^"
[06:25:28] <crockstylie> I use this : http://pastebin.com/LV4QS4jZ
[06:25:51] <crockstylie> I don't know how far you want me to show you my code though ^^"
[06:26:50] <crockstylie> Success stuff is executed, but there is not any new line in my db table
[06:27:03] <Kartagis> $(this) ? it seems wrong. you should replace it with the form's ID
[06:27:40] <Kartagis> like data: $("#form").serialize()
[06:28:12] <crockstylie> Sorry, didn't give you enough : http://pastebin.com/jUu2Uswt
[06:28:33] <crockstylie> But I don't think the error is there.
[06:30:56] <Kartagis> I'm not sure what this refers to here.
[06:31:51] <Kartagis> crockstylie: to test, pass your form elements instead of serialising the form
[06:32:43] <Kartagis> like data:{name:$("#name").val(),...}
[06:38:15] <crockstylie> I have tried, but didn't save in db ^^ and before I tried to console.log : $(this).serialize()
[06:38:50] <crockstylie> It showed in console : foo=bar&foo2=bar2
[06:39:18] <crockstylie> So, I think the $(this).serialize() works like it has to ^^
[06:40:45] <crockstylie> Sorry, I have to go to lunch (sorry for me :D) see you in a moment ^^"
[06:44:13] <pjanzen> Hi All, I am using jquery and dataTables to generate a table which works fine. The last column contains 2 buttons, delete and edit. I can click the button and it console.log() the data however it is the same records for each row I have.
[06:44:34] <pjanzen> Can someone give me a some pointers on what could be wrong?
[07:20:42] <jak2000> hi all
[07:21:34] <jak2000> friends robertmaxx recommended me use: prevent event or something, my main goal is capture, the user use ENTER key tab for movement into the controls.... any advice how to? thanks
[08:04:14] <taplar> pjanzen: and example showing the issue would be helpful
[08:04:24] <taplar> jak2000: what are you wanting to do?
[08:08:18] <Gloomy> Hi :-)
[08:08:41] <Gloomy> I've always used jquery client-side; I'm trying server side now and I'm a bit confused.
[08:09:15] <Gloomy> How can I take a String containing the full html of a page and have jquery act on it as if it was an actual webpage?
[08:09:33] <taplar> you don't
[08:09:41] <Gloomy> no? :(
[08:09:47] <taplar> iirc jquery will eat some of your html tags
[08:10:02] <Gloomy> How should I do it then?
[08:10:05] <taplar> jquery is intended for manipulating the dom and html fragments
[08:10:22] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[08:10:36] <Gloomy> I need to manipulate a rendered view in express before sending it to the client
[08:11:32] <taplar> you might try giving it only the substring containing the '<body>...</body>' and manipulate that
[08:12:39] <Gloomy> Hmm. And how do i set it up so my jquery commands actually act on that ?
[08:12:52] <taplar> what do you mean?
[08:13:16] <Gloomy> I see there is jQuery.parseHTML()
[08:13:37] <Gloomy> Well, how do I manipulate that substring via jquery
[08:13:41] <taplar> var htmlFragment = $( bodyHtmlString );  htmlFragment.doStuff
[08:14:19] <Gloomy> it automatically recognises the string as html?
[08:14:51] <taplar> yep
[08:14:52] <Gloomy> Cool. I'll try. Thanks for your help.
[08:58:36] <yezariael> Hi! I understand I need to set "white-space" property in css to preserve newlines in $.text() function. How can I preserve newlines when *getting* the text from an element? Newlines are being completely stripped right now.
[09:02:37] <helvetet> What is recommended to use when you want to use ajax to get a specific portion of a page and insert as html? like i want to get the .data class from page x and put it in dom
[09:04:48] <helvetet> how do i parse the data?
[09:05:41] <taplar> yezariael: your saying test() is removing new lines?
[09:05:48] <taplar> * text()
[09:07:18] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/h41wmus7/ <-- doesn't appear to
[09:08:04] <taplar> helvetet: so your ajax is returning a html fragment?
[09:08:16] <helvetet> no the ajax is returning a full html page
[09:08:37] <taplar> you really shouldn't be returning a full page with an ajax request
[09:09:32] <helvetet> the pages aren't very big
[09:09:35] <taplar> you should only return what you need
[09:09:41] <helvetet> yeah obv
[09:10:10] <helvetet> but i wanted to try out the history pushstate and then just fetch the html of whatever i clicked on
[09:10:16] <helvetet> and then get the content of those pages and embed them on the current page
[09:11:09] <taplar> you could try doing something like i told the guy earlier.  give jquery the substring of the <body></body> part and then get/manipulate whatever you need
[09:18:01] <Patte> Hello how do I create a plugin with multiple internal functions?
[09:18:19] <Patte> i have the settings object but want to organize my plugin with internal functions
[09:18:23] <taplar> have you looked over the learning center article on plugins?
[09:18:48] <Patte> taplar: yes they only show me the settings object
[09:18:58] <Patte> and the believe my plugin is that small :D
[09:19:31] <mehale> hello folks, I have an issue in which "$('span').on('click', 'a', function()..." is not working on <a> elements added dynamically. Any idea what to look for?
[09:19:51] <helvetet> use window
[09:20:02] <helvetet> wait i forgot the awnser
[09:20:09] <taplar> it needs to be bound to a pre-existing element
[09:20:22] <taplar> if span is dynamic, or doesn't exist at the time of the binding, that won't work
[09:20:33] <helvetet> $(window).on('click', 'span a', function()
[09:20:34] <helvetet> something like that?
[09:20:44] <helvetet> i forgot if its window or document or whatever
[09:20:46] <taplar> that could work, but you hsould bind lower
[09:21:18] <mehale> ahhh, I see... I should bind as low as possible, right?
[09:21:26] <taplar> yes
[09:21:40] <taplar> every event within that bound element will be evaluated
[09:21:50] <mehale> can I make as on('click', 'a.my_class'... ?
[09:22:25] <taplar> sure
[09:22:51] <mehale> great, thank you folks
[09:22:58] <taplar> Patte: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/  see that code block about protecting the $ alias?
[09:24:28] <Patte> taplar: yes i see but i dont see how there are multiple internal functions used
[09:24:43] <taplar> ok, so inside that closure, you can create whatever functions you want
[09:24:44] <Patte> the docs think im just writing my spagetthi code there
[09:25:06] <taplar> and you can use them inside your $.fn.whatever functions
[09:25:34] <Patte> taplar: i would like to write them like so    myFoo: function() { ...
[09:25:46] <taplar> so put them in an object
[09:25:57] <taplar> just semantics at that point
[09:25:57] <Patte> taplar: how to call them then?
[09:27:06] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/seko4y5v/
[09:29:38] <Patte> taplar: thank  you very much!
[09:29:40] <Patte> =)
[09:29:42] <taplar> np
[09:29:45] <Patte> i lik
[09:40:05] <Patte> taplar: so i have this now, but what to write for ??? http://dpaste.com/3W4G79H
[09:40:42] <taplar> not sure what your asking
[09:41:04] <taplar> you don't have to do that on ln 2 btw, it would always be undefined at that point
[09:43:02] <Patte> taplar: so i would like to write it like this http://dpaste.com/3AEDT7W
[09:43:09] <Patte> what do i set $.fn to?
[09:43:27] <Patte> so i like to calll it $('#foo').shop();
[09:44:03] <taplar> what should shop() do?
[09:44:16] <Patte> taplar: this is my plugin name/namespace
[09:44:19] <taplar> you have to have a $.fn.shop = ... for that to be available
[09:44:52] <taplar> but in your snipplet the var shop is an object so you can't do just $.fn.shop = shop.
[09:44:59] <taplar> which is why i asked what your wanting to do
[09:45:53] <Patte> taplar: i like to write my plugin this way with object literal notation
[09:46:03] <Patte> and i also like to have its own namespace
[09:46:13] <taplar> it already has it's own namespace
[09:46:20] <taplar> the outer most function is it's namespace
[09:46:21] <Patte> why does jquery/js offer so much ways, this sucks
[09:46:42] <Patte> :/
[09:46:48] <taplar> you understand that right?
[09:47:01] <Patte> yes
[09:47:17] <Patte> i know it is encapulated with (function($) ...
[09:47:44] <taplar> which is an anonymous function which works as a namespace
[09:50:48] <yezariael> taplar: your jsfiddle doesn exactly what I said. It displays the whole text in one line.
[09:51:06] <taplar> my console showed it on multi lines
[09:51:10] <taplar> are you in ff or chrome?
[09:51:14] <yezariael> ff
[09:51:18] <taplar> hmm
[09:51:29] <yezariael> well
[09:51:36] <yezariael> console shows it as multiline, you're right
[09:51:38] <yezariael> wait a sec
[09:52:09] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/h41wmus7/1/
[09:55:41] <yezariael> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/7L7jw85f
[09:56:01] <yezariael> problem stems from contenteditable inserting <br> as newlines
[09:56:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7L7jw85f/1/
[09:57:31] <yezariael> yeah, that was my solution in the end. use html() and then replace(/<br>/gi, "\n");
[10:09:08] <helvetet> if i use find('element'), how do i output everything but that element?
[10:09:13] <helvetet> if i want to do .html
[10:11:11] <taplar> 'that' element ?
[10:12:54] <helvetet> like if i have <element><child></child><anotherchild></anotherchild></element> if i do .find('element') i get "<element><child></child><anotherchild></anotherchild></element>" but i want "<child></child><anotherchild></anotherchild>"
[10:13:19] <taplar> html() returns the innerHTML so it wouldn't includ the outer element tag
[10:13:57] <helvetet> i did do .find('element').html() but it included element
[10:15:15] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2wmtznqs/
[10:18:37] <helvetet> find doesnt work that way
[10:18:44] <helvetet> find includes whatever you want to find
[10:19:31] <helvetet> anyways solved it by making all the child elements into a specific element and doing
[10:19:37] <helvetet> .find('element').find('child')
[10:19:39] <tmoe> Hi, i have a table relatet to a css class defined in separate file unsing jquery ui selectable. Without using the class for the table, selectable is working fine, with class enabled nothing goes.
[10:19:49] <tmoe> How does the css class part has to be designed to work with selectable?
[10:22:21] <crockstylie> Hi again ^^. I posted my problem earlier, but I'm still stuck. I work on a mysql, php, pdo, jquery, ajax, bootstrap, modal form : http://pastebin.com/L83ydfiP When I comment the pastebin snippet in my code, on the form submit, data ise saved to my database. But when I reactivate my ajax call, it doesn't. Though, in console it shows me : word_1foo=bar&foo2=bar2 word_2. After many times searching on Google, I don't know what is going wrong ^^
[10:23:02] <Tennis> so the form submit works manually but not with ajax?
[10:23:07] <crockstylie> yep
[10:24:13] <Tennis> whats the console say? when doing it the ajaxy way?
[10:24:54] <crockstylie> It displais just my two console.log("word" + data)
[10:24:57] <crockstylie> content
[10:24:59] <crockstylie> :
[10:25:15] <crockstylie> word_1 foo=bar&foo2=bar
[10:25:20] <crockstylie> word_2
[10:26:20] <helvetet> how does your form work?
[10:26:32] <crockstylie> In inspect>network>create.php>headers I have a 200 OK response and I can see my submitted data
[10:26:42] <helvetet> show the form html
[10:27:01] <crockstylie> helvetet, what do you mean by how my form work ?
[10:27:08] <crockstylie> ok
[10:27:12] <crockstylie> I do a pastebin
[10:29:31] <crockstylie> http://pastebin.com/TLyJcxVG
[10:29:38] <crockstylie> There it is :)
[10:30:05] <taplar> helvetet: https://jsfiddle.net/2wmtznqs/1/
[10:30:11] <taplar> crap
[10:30:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2wmtznqs/2/
[10:30:36] <taplar> still doesn't include the outer
[10:30:58] <helvetet> strange
[10:31:13] <taplar> like i said, html() returns the innerHTML.  it will not include the outer tag
[10:31:56] <helvetet> i just found some code
[10:31:57] <helvetet> div = $('<div>'); div.html(data); content = div.find('content').find('section'); content.html();
[10:33:07] <helvetet> oh wait
[10:33:10] <helvetet> it works now
[10:33:12] <helvetet> hm
[10:33:49] <helvetet> anwyayas crockstylie not sure what is wrong
[10:34:26] <crockstylie> Ok ^^" it's been hours now I'm turning my code in every way, and don't find where it is wrong
[10:35:43] <taplar> what is the issue?
[10:36:03] <crockstylie> taplar, mine ?
[10:36:06] <taplar> yep
[10:36:30] <helvetet> what does the create.php return?
[10:36:59] <crockstylie> I have a form (html bootstrap modal) that I can submit the php way (php pdo mysql), but not the jquery ajax way
[10:38:52] <helvetet> i mean you aren't getting an error
[10:39:18] <crockstylie> Nope
[10:39:21] <taplar> did you verify that it's hitting the correct endpoint in the network tab?
[10:40:25] <taplar> you can also verify in the network tab the data sent and see the response
[10:42:03] <crockstylie> I go to netrwork tab, then I click on create.php which appears in the list just when I submit myu form, and I have 200 OK respoonse, and I can also see my submitted data : foo: bar, foo2: bar2
[10:42:28] <taplar> so the url is correct, the submit data is correct ?
[10:42:37] <crockstylie> yep. It seems
[10:42:38] <crockstylie> so
[10:42:46] <taplar> so that suggests a backend issue
[10:42:56] <crockstylie> backend ?
[10:43:06] <taplar> the endpoint, it's processing
[10:43:29] <crockstylie> you mean my php script ?
[10:43:31] <taplar> yep
[10:43:56] <taplar> if your hitting the correct endpoint, giving it all the needed data, and it's not working, that suggests an issue with the consumer
[10:44:31] <taplar> are you trying to make your ajax do the very same thing as if you had let the submit go through?
[10:44:33] <crockstylie> I've tried to comment the ajax function, and then, the php way, when submitting the form, data is stored in my db
[10:44:44] <crockstylie> So I assumed my php script is right XD
[10:45:18] <taplar> then i would check for differences in the network tab between the request for the form and the ajax request
[10:45:32] <crockstylie> ouh yeah, good idea :)
[10:45:36] <crockstylie> I'll do that
[10:45:47] <taplar> cause in that case, 'i verified the data' seems suspect, ;)
[10:46:36] <taplar> and just to make sure, your for is method="POST" right?
[10:46:39] <taplar> *form
[10:48:03] <crockstylie> method post yep
[10:48:12] <crockstylie> And I checked, there is a difference.
[10:48:56] <crockstylie> In ajax, I have foo: bar, foo2, bar2 but in php I have foo: bar, foo2: bar2, submit: submit
[10:49:03] <taplar> ;)
[10:49:11] <merkazu> anyone here have some experience with magnific popup, embedding youtube videos in it? I'm trying to track video completion and I'm not sure how to listen for that type of event?
[10:49:26] <taplar> see if you put that in your ajax if that makes a difference
[10:50:37] <neo12> this mustache plugin interprets all params as text, I have a param that has html, anyone know how to display it as is? https://github.com/necolas/flight-mustache
[10:51:54] <decx> merkazu: youtube api has events for this
[10:52:05] <neo12> anyone?
[10:52:31] <crockstylie> sorry, I have to shout a little : YEEEESSSSS !!!!! thank you :)
[10:52:37] <taplar> cool
[10:52:51] <taplar> so what did we learn? :)
[10:53:21] <crockstylie> The problem was just var data = $(this).serialize(); didn't add submit. So I added it like this : var data = $(this).serialize() + "&submit=submit";
[10:53:37] <taplar> but more importantly.  the network tab is your friend, :)
[10:53:48] <crockstylie> yes, obviously :)

[10:55:18] <taplar> {{{just take it}}}
[11:02:05] <mmmveggies> {{{heavy breathing}}}
[11:03:11] <Ungy> anyone know an easy way to say hide any rows of a table past a certain number say I want to only display 20 rows of a hundred
[11:03:49] <decx> only send 20 rows from the server
[11:04:23] <Ungy> I was looking for somethign a bit more dynamic
[11:04:55] <decx> have your server endpoint understand a limit parameter
[11:05:13] <taplar> page and limit
[11:05:17] <Ungy> it does buit I am tryign to allow my users to dynamically siwtch there view
[11:05:25] <decx> i call page offset but same thing
[11:05:45] <Ungy> as well as I want to be able to do pagination against this limit set
[11:06:08] <taplar> 'switch their view' ?
[11:07:00] <Ungy> yes 'switch their view' meaning they can specify a number of maximum rows they wish to appear against a dataset
[11:07:33] <taplar> so you'd give them the option to change their limit
[11:07:43] <Ungy> correct
[11:07:59] <taplar> so what's the confusion?
[11:09:18] <Ungy> I also have a filter on it allowing the user to type somethign and if it matches anythign in the table it hides those that do not match. BUt I need to then limit those to only the specified limit
[11:09:40] <Ungy> I guess I just need to do it against the data and redraw I guess
[11:10:29] <taplar> so your saying you have a filter that should filter the results, but could potentially show records that were not showing before due to the limit?
[11:10:46] <decx> just use datatables
[11:11:02] <Ungy> correct I show all when the limit goes and then once I filter I need to hide the excess
[11:11:17] <taplar> how many records are we talking?
[11:12:13] <Ungy> up to 1000 in total
[11:13:20] <taplar> it's not that great to load all those records and then hide them.  i dunno, what do you think decx?  personally i'd make the filter be a submit thing that'd limit the returned results
[11:13:52] <decx> depends how many fields are in the table
[11:14:26] <decx> 1000 rows is like on the brink to make a preload viable or not
[11:16:14] <CSWookie> Hey folks, how do I know that an autocomplete is finished getting data after keystroke?
[11:16:53] <Ungy> I am building a control that will allow for hiding and showing columns filtering entire tabel filtering on specific columns ordering by columns pagination and display count avaialble
[11:17:19] <taplar> sounds like datatables
[11:17:37] <taplar> ish
[11:17:59] <Ungy> kind of
[11:18:47] <taplar> CSWookie: there is a response event that you might look at
[11:18:57] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-response
[11:19:25] <taplar> otherwise if your doing the ajax call yourself in the source: handler you could always check the ajax promise/deferred
[11:20:18] <CSWookie> Actually, I think open() might be what I want...  I'm writing automated tests of pages that use jquery stuff, and I've learned from hard experience with this sort of stuff that if I don't wait for widgets to be done with what they're doing, I get timeing errors.
[11:20:46] <taplar> what testing library are you using?
[11:21:14] <CSWookie> I'm using selenium
[11:21:22] <taplar> ah, functional testing
[11:21:38] <CSWookie> funcitonal/regression, yeah.
[11:22:16] <taplar> i thought selenium waited for requests to finish
[11:22:29] <taplar> i know sahi had issues with that stuff, but i thought selenium fixed that
[11:23:06] <taplar> ah, nvm i got that backwards
[11:25:06] <CSWookie> Everytime the boss sees a new javascript oogoo, he has the devs include it, and then I have to extend the framework I built on top of selenium.  I'm glad I designed the thing with extensibility in mind.
[11:25:14] <taplar> just talked with one of my qas.  according to him in one of our projects that used selenium that did some basic waits for things that were asynchronous to accomidate that issue
[11:25:33] <taplar> that = they
[11:26:37] <taplar> not sure if that is the best practice but worked for them.  and hey, there is a #selenium room on this server, :)
[11:27:11] <merkazu> I'm sorry, I've been looking all over and I can't find an explanation as to why this doesn't work. http://hastebin.com/fuzakaforo.vbs I'm just trying to get a message when the video ends. yes, i do have the youtube API script in the head
[11:28:52] <merkazu> more specifically, player runs fine and everything, that event is not being emitted at all. i've even tried just inserting a console log at the top of onPlayerStateChange in the event that it's just the conditional
[11:30:17] <CSWookie> taplar: I spend a lot of time in there.  But I figured this room would be the best place to ask about the jquery API.  Our other autocompletes keep a running list of their outstanding queries, I though maybe jqueries did as well.
[11:30:43] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[11:30:55] <taplar> if so it's most likely internal
[11:35:02] <awkwardCough> merkazu: it looks like it should work, can you hastebin your full code to see it is a problem elsewhere?
[11:35:38] <awkwardCough> herp derp ignore that i was looking at wrong thing
[11:37:58] <jmdrawneek> Should I add 'throw' errors for things like checking if libraries are loaded? Is that a good practice or should I remove anything like that from production code?
[11:39:43] <awkwardCough> merkazu: how do you start the video?
[11:40:38] <taplar> depends on how you want that to work
[11:41:03] <taplar> if you want it to silently fail you can throw things other than Errors, or just conditionally not do stuff instead of throwing things
[11:42:22] <taplar> throwing an Error though can be handy if you want a stack trace
[11:44:18] <merkazu> what do you mean? I just click on the .popup-youtube link which has $('.popup-youtube').magnificPopup({type:'iframe'}); applied on document ready
[11:45:11] <jmdrawneek> I was thinking of maintainability but one of my work colleagues thinks anything like that should be removed from production code
[11:45:14] <CSWookie> taplar: Sad times... Well, I'll roll my own with open() and search() events, then.
[11:45:40] <taplar> the jsfiddle towards the bottom as a line that says: player.playVideo()  to start it
[11:45:50] <taplar> i don't see anything like that in yours
[11:47:21] <taplar> jmdrawneek: what's his reason?
[11:47:37] <taplar> and "i don't like it" isn't a reason, :)
[11:48:32] <jmdrawneek> taplar: Messy and the end user doesn't need to know
[11:48:52] <merkazu> starting the video itself, not showing the popup? in that case, it's due to the autoplay=1 parameter provided in the src
[11:49:04] <taplar> ah
[11:49:16] <taplar> jmdrawneek: are you throwing messages or throwing Error objects?
[11:50:04] <taplar> cause afaik unless you have a try catch and logging the message, things other than Errors are invisible to the end user.  or really it's invisible to everyone unless they have their console open
[11:50:41] <taplar> and counter point, your stuff should work.  so those throws shouldn't happen anyway, ;)
[11:51:42] <jmdrawneek> taplar: Ugh got disconnected. Did you say anything?
[11:51:56] <taplar> jmdrawneek: are you throwing messages or throwing Error objects?
[11:51:58] <taplar> cause afaik unless you have a try catch and logging the message, things other than Errors are invisible to the end user.  or really it's invisible to everyone unless they have their console open
[11:52:00] <taplar> and counter point, your stuff should work.  so those throws shouldn't happen anyway, ;)
[11:52:03] <taplar> :P
[11:53:24] <jmdrawneek> taplar: Error messages if the jquery library has not been included.
[11:53:53] <jmdrawneek> Shoudn't you always expect your code to fail? That a best practice!
[11:53:58] <taplar> so sure.  it will log in the console.  but again, that shouldn't be something that happens.  it should get fixed
[11:55:01] <jmdrawneek> taplar: It's a dependancy check though so nothings broken as such if it's erroring. Might just be a resource missing
[11:55:23] <taplar> it's not broken?  so it's unnecessary?
[11:55:50] <jmdrawneek> The feature won't work but it's not a code error
[11:56:06] <taplar> so a feature not working isn't considered 'broken'?
[11:56:12] <taplar> wish i worked there
[11:58:10] <taplar> but anyway, i'm not arguing that you should use them.  simply giving reasons for why you might want to.  entirely up to you
[12:00:39] <merkazu> is there an equivalent to $f for youtube stuff? I found some code that a senior dev used in another project but it's for vimeo
[12:26:18] <merkazu> holy cow, okay, that was extremely stupid. evidently magnific doesn't use IDs on iframes by default. so you actually had to write the new markup to support the id, key in on that. ALSO, you had to add &enablejsapi=1 to the source
[14:04:03] <robertmaxrees> yaaaaay
[14:09:46] <awkwardCough> Apparently, f$ is associated with froogaloop, which is...
[14:09:46] <awkwardCough> ¿ʎɐɐɐɐɐʎ
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> do what now
[14:22:50] <huck5> Hi. I'm trying to trigger an event when `window.onunload` is called. I then bind a listener to my document to listen for the event and perform actions. Now, my breakpoint on the `$.trigger('customEvent')` is being hit, but none of the code in the listener function is being executed... Is this because `$.trigger` is async, and it's not happening before the window closes?
[14:23:21] <robertmaxrees> what does the event do?
[14:23:31] <huck5> Right now just calls alert()
[14:23:37] <robertmaxrees> because once the window goes to close, almost all bets are off.
[14:23:43] <robertmaxrees> just bind directly to window.onunload instead
[14:24:04] <huck5> Previously I had just set `window.onunload = function() {...}`, and did my work there. That functioned properly.
[14:24:10] <robertmaxrees> right - so do that.
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> don't trigger an evemt
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> *event
[14:24:19] <huck5> robertmaxrees, gotcha, thanks!
[14:24:32] <robertmaxrees> .trigger() isn't async, fwiw.
[14:25:54] <huck5> Yeah, I didn't think so..
[14:33:24] <cjohnson> How can I do .parent .child:first where I am selecting only the matching first child of each parent
[14:33:36] <cjohnson> so if I have 3 parents and each has 3 children, I am only selecting the first child of each
[14:34:59] <taplar> :first-child
[14:52:42] <CSWookie> Hey, all.  Anyone know what jqxInput does if it's using a function to call out to a server for its data, and it gets responses in the wrong order?
[14:53:12] <CSWookie> Does it drop the out-of-order requests on the floor, or does it still display them?
[14:56:12] <taplar> this guy? http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxinput/index.htm#demos/jqxinput/defaultfunctionality.htm
[14:58:09] <CSWookie> Yes, him.
[14:58:31] <taplar> though i take it it's more similar to this version http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxinput/index.htm#demos/jqxinput/remoteautocomplete.htm
[14:59:57] <CSWookie> Both of those urls result in the same page.  But I am using jqxInput with a remote data source.
[15:00:17] <taplar> i'd try putting a console.log in the loadComplete method maybe printing out the data.  if you see them coming in out of order then that would suggest that the plugin is not cancelling previous inprogress requests
[15:00:33] <CSWookie> And that page doesn't tell me what it does in the event of an out of order response, because it focuses on using an array as a data source.
[15:00:47] <taplar> the second link i gave does an ajax request
[15:01:32] <CSWookie> yeah, but then I've got go alter my server to gaurantee out of orderness.  I was hoping to avoid doing that, by finding either someone who knew the answer, or better documentation.
[15:01:44] <CSWookie> The second link you gave redirects to the first.
[15:01:50] <taplar> no, you'd just change your fetch to cancel previous requests
[15:02:29] <taplar> uh, click the autocomplete link on the lhs and then view source tab
[15:04:05] <CSWookie> How would that tell me what the widget does with out of order responses?
[15:04:47] <CSWookie> I'm missing something in your explanation, sorry for being dense.
[15:05:58] <taplar> if your doing something similar to that with the loadComplete handler, that happens when the response is returned.  by logging it you can visually see in the console in what order they return, if they are returning out of order.  to confirm if it is or is not cancelling previous requests for you already
[15:09:36] <CSWookie> Looks like, according to dataAdapter's api, by default order is not guaranteed, because it uses async...  I'll talk with the dev about setting it to sync.
[15:10:25] <taplar> a better approach would be to find a way to get a reference to the ajax request made and should another try to start before it finishes, cancel the original
[15:14:43] <CSWookie> probably would be better that way, yeah.
[15:17:54] <taplar> my google foo is failing me.  can you do jqXHR.reject() ?
[15:18:38] <shoky> you can .abort()
[15:18:46] <taplar> sweet
[15:19:15] <taplar> ok, so the jqxDataAdapter looks to take an option of beforeSend
[15:19:23] <taplar> first parameter it passes in is the jqXHR
[15:19:43] <taplar> you could store that some where and should you come into that beforeSend and that variable is already set, abort it
[15:54:21] <saransh__> Hi, how can i set autoplay speed in owl carousel?
[15:54:35] <saransh__> to 1mili second
[15:54:45] <saransh__> or less than that
[15:58:07] <taplar> so you want it to just continuously slide?
[15:58:24] <saransh__> yes
[15:58:49] <saransh__> I have set autoplay to true
[15:59:14] <saransh__> so the continous sliding is working fine
[15:59:33] <saransh__> but i want to increase the sliding speed
[16:01:17] <thevishy> can I change the document root of a jquery object completely without doing jQuery('document')
[16:01:28] <codecutter> i have a scroll event attached to the window, problem is when I scroll down just oncem line 19 is invoked more than once, I need to print just the once? http://pastebin.com/M35WA79W
[16:01:29] <taplar> saransh__: and your setting the autoplaySpeed?
[16:01:59] <saransh__> taplar: Yes, I am also setting that
[16:02:23] <taplar> thevishy: that wouldn't be changing the context, that would be creating a new jquery object
[16:02:29] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[16:02:47] <thevishy> i have a jQuery in a iframe, I wanted to use that in my parent
[16:03:05] <taplar> so you want to search the iframe for something
[16:03:08] <thevishy> the jQuery in an iframe comes from an application, I am trying to extend that application functionality
[16:03:10] <saransh__> taplar: but I think it is not making any effect on the sliding sppedn
[16:03:18] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[16:03:41] <taplar> oh, your wanting to access the parent dom from the iframe?
[16:03:46] <thevishy> so I wanted the jQuery object from the *iframe* but not it should just behave like its from the the parent DOM
[16:04:09] <taplar> your probably going to run into some weirdness with that but one sec.
[16:04:35] <thevishy> okay taplar I just wanted to know how to do that. I can ofcourse download it again but I am thinking why do I do that
[16:04:55] <taplar> download it again?
[16:05:10] <taplar> you mean jQuery?
[16:05:12] <thevishy> i mean I can use a CDN and load it into the parent etc
[16:05:26] <taplar> it'll be cached after the first load
[16:05:42] <taplar> if that's what your worried about
[16:05:59] <thevishy> taplar: in tihs scenario, it works completely differently I have to use my own CDN
[16:06:08] <taplar> same result
[16:06:10] <thevishy> the application that uses jQuery doesn't extend it to me
[16:06:14] <taplar> the browser will cache the file
[16:06:58] <thevishy> in one case it will come from server xyz and I don't know how because application loads it from xyz
[16:07:25] <taplar> don't know how to what?
[16:07:44] <thevishy> that application is an abstraction, we just use it as a service
[16:08:00] <thevishy> think of it like I am loading google docs and it might be internally using jQuery
[16:08:22] <taplar> so your page has an iframe to a secondary domain?
[16:08:32] <thevishy> ah yeah it does
[16:08:39] <taplar> you can't access cross domain doms dude
[16:08:56] <thevishy> no it won't be a different domain
[16:09:03] <thevishy> let me explain it like this ...
[16:09:23] <thevishy> so we have bought an application which runs on its own app server - it has front-end and back-end
[16:09:35] <VectorX> i have some data-img img urls on div elements, which activate on hover, bit slow since the image loads at the time, how can i preload these ?
[16:09:39] <thevishy> it will be hosted in our ennvironment, but it gets redirected to another app server
[16:09:51] <thevishy> now that app server is an abstraction to me, but I know they use jQuery
[16:10:04] <taplar> does that redirect belong to the same domain
[16:10:16] <thevishy> yes, its all in the same domain
[16:10:41] <taplar> and that other domain uses jQuery
[16:10:49] <thevishy> yeah they do and I load it as a popup
[16:10:57] <codecutter> any ideas?
[16:11:08] <taplar> and your wanting to use that jQuery instead of including it in your parent page
[16:11:12] <thevishy> now I wanted to extend their app, my goal is to use their jQuery in a different DOM :)
[16:11:29] <thevishy> exactly my problem taplar
[16:11:31] <taplar> ok ok ok, so your wanting to do stuff from the parent to the iframe dom
[16:11:46] <thevishy> not to the iframe dom :)
[16:12:05] <thevishy> i have to do it in parent, because that app has some restrictions playing around with its dom
[16:12:14] <taplar> you want to use their jQuery from the iframe, on the parent window
[16:12:16] <thevishy> it however allows me to do stuff in my DOM and transport it as a view
[16:12:27] <arc_> codecutter what you will do to test whether this code has run will depend on the actual functionality you want. with console.log you won't be able to unless you set a variable or something like that
[16:12:37] <thevishy> yeah and when I use that jquery object, it should behave like its parent's and not iframes!
[16:12:56] <taplar> you realize that's going to very weird to work with
[16:13:03] <taplar> cause here's the thing
[16:13:16] <thevishy> I am thinking what could be the fundamental problems as well :)
[16:13:30] <thevishy> i was thinking with jQuery I should be able to switch the context :)
[16:13:31] <taplar> your going to have to access the iframes dom to get access to jQuery, which then is going to have to access the parent dom for ANYTHING it does with it
[16:14:14] <thevishy> ah so I can't like clone it?
[16:14:28] <thevishy> clone the object or something of that sort, here it looks like that is what I want
[16:14:37] <taplar> maybe, never done anything like that.  lets start first with the accessing the different doms
[16:14:39] <thevishy> I know this is something weird but I wanted to know if its possible or not
[16:15:00] <thevishy> I got it like this jQuery = window.frames[0].jQuery
[16:15:16] <thevishy> i mean if that is like too much of a hack I will go and download it?
[16:15:35] <taplar> that works?
[16:16:02] <thevishy> yeah that works, and now I do everything like jQuery(document) ... and it does everything normal
[16:16:26] <taplar> damn.  so yeah window.$ = window.frames[0].jQuery; and call it a day, :)
[16:16:43] <thevishy> no no, I entered a problem
[16:16:48] <VeryBewitching> Anyone know if there's a shortcut that will allow me to use the result of .attr('class') as a new selector?  ie. $(el).prev($(el).attr('class')) ?
[16:17:12] <VeryBewitching> Trying to find the previous element with the same class list in the DOM
[16:17:14] <thevishy> I downloaded Boostrap and I reckon its doing stuff to the iframe and not my parent
[16:17:15] <thevishy> :))
[16:17:27] <VeryBewitching> (and not a previous sibling)
[16:17:32] <thevishy> because Bootstrap using jQuery everywhere and it is pointing to that iframe DOM
[16:17:33] <taplar> bootstrap is not jquery, :P
[16:17:43] <thevishy> bootstrap.js btw which needs jQuery
[16:18:29] <thevishy> window.$ = window.frames[0].jQuery solves some of my problems, so then I thought why don't I use bootstrap modals :)
[16:18:35] <thevishy> and now I am stuck lol
[16:18:42] <thevishy> it all works if I take the normal route
[16:18:45] <taplar> i really don't get why you don't just include them on the parents...
[16:18:58] <thevishy> hosting is the concern mainly taplar
[16:19:07] <taplar> it's already hosted.  the child is importing it
[16:19:22] <thevishy> nah we buy that app entire as a container
[16:19:31] <thevishy> we deploy it as a vm and use it
[16:19:45] <taplar> the url that the app uses to import the jQuery, is that subject to change?
[16:19:49] <thevishy> its like a service for us and they don't serve it like they serve their mainapp.js
[16:20:01] <thevishy> they don't serve it over their jetty server
[16:20:05] <thevishy> I tried that first thing
[16:20:34] <thevishy> atleat to be honest I don't see a network request going to download jQuery.js
[16:20:55] <thevishy> probably I will dig that up again?
[16:21:01] <taplar> it might be hidden from you since it's in an iframe.  i forget
[16:21:06] <thevishy> aaah
[16:21:21] <taplar> but again, that iframe is including the jQuery on it.  the url that it uses to get it, is that subject to change?
[16:21:21] <thevishy> yah perhaps let me check deep into that iframe and see
[16:21:34] <thevishy> its not subject to change, because we are maitaining the site
[16:21:42] <thevishy> if I get access to that URL then my problem is resolved
[16:21:44] <taplar> so why not use that same url on the parent page?
[16:22:10] <thevishy> i haven't found that URL ... probably need to search the Iframe carefully
[16:22:22] <taplar> can you go straight to the url of the iframe?
[16:22:45] <thevishy> nah, i get its constructed using JS?
[16:22:59] <thevishy> its like a wysiwyg editor
[16:23:13] <thevishy> so they use iframe for their wysiqyg editor mainly
[16:23:15] <taplar> ok, then right click on the iframe content, there should be an option for something like 'with this iframe' or something, click that and then there should be an inspect option
[16:23:34] <taplar> you should be able to view the source or see resources or something to find where the jquery came from
[16:23:51] <thevishy> okay yeah let me dig into that and see where it comes from
[16:24:03] <thevishy> so the cloning jQuery idea doesn't look really easy right taplar
[16:24:18] <taplar> if i was a developer coming in after you, i'd yell wtf
[16:24:44] <thevishy> correct, yeah but its something good to know if its possible or not
[16:24:48] <taplar> easy/hard doesn't always translate to 'maintainability' which is the important thing
[16:25:11] <thevishy> I get it, probably I don't do this in my work :)
[16:27:36] <thevishy> cool taplar, I can see it in the iframe! and its not subject to change
[16:28:04] <thevishy> I guess I was checking it in the main DOM all the while forgetting that it gets loaded into the Frame in the first place
[16:28:58] <taplar> good deal
[16:30:14] <thevishy> yeah, should solve my worries, I really don't mind loading it over
[16:32:26] <taplar> VeryBewitching: iirc you can use el.className
[16:32:31] <taplar> instead of wrapping it again
[16:40:44] <codecutter> i have scroll listener on line 47, which calls an ajax function (line 31), which in turn calls the function on line 75 and appends the data to the dom, problem is with the function on line 75, which for some reason is appending data repeatedly (ajax returns an array 7 object) but this function is repeatedly adding these objects to the dom  - http://pastebin.com/8GL3uYQW
[16:41:51] <taplar> you realize scroll fires a crap ton of times right?
[16:42:08] <ryanneufeld> I was just gonna say that
[16:42:29] <ryanneufeld> codecutter: you need to put in a delay before allowing the function to get called again
[16:44:30] <taplar> your also doing lookups in your handler.  try to cache those outside the handler and use them
[16:44:43] <taplar> especially in the case of a scroll handler
[16:47:11] <codecutter> taplar: would this work delay work https://jsfiddle.net/wQr2V/5/
[16:49:01] <taplar> you could try and see.  scope the variable down to your namespace though
[16:50:16] <codecutter> how about placing delay on line 32, just after the function is invoked?
[16:50:59] <taplar> in the success handler?
[16:52:04] <taplar> your wanting to throttle the whole thing
[16:52:20] <codecutter> yes, in success
[16:52:39] <taplar> no, you want to throttle the whole thing.  it's too late at that point.
[16:53:32] <taplar> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ fwiw
[16:53:40] <codecutter> tapler: how about using this http://underscorejs.org/#throttle?
[16:54:30] <taplar> interesting, not familiar with it but give it a shot
[16:55:30] <codecutter> I think they both the same, do I use throttle or debounce>
[16:55:49] <taplar> depends on where you want the delay.  read the descriptions
[16:57:01] <taplar> throttle fires immediately, and if you try again during the wait time, it will fire immediately after the wait time is up
[16:57:23] <taplar> where as debounce will wait for the wait time after the last attempt
[16:58:05] <taplar> so with debounce if you make it wait a second, it will wait a second before happening, unless it gets another, say at 800 milliseconds, in which case it will wait another 1000 from that point
[16:59:27] <taplar> anyway, i'm out.  later peeps
[17:09:29] <robertparkerx> I'm not sure why I'm not able to pass this obj back through a jquery ajax
[17:09:56] <robertparkerx> Am I supposed to json_encode before i pass the array back through .ajax
[17:11:54] <robertmaxrees> what object?
[17:12:02] <robertmaxrees> how are you trying to "pass" it "back through"

[17:52:55] <fas3r> Hello
[17:54:24] <andrew_> I have created form field validator(regex, email and password), but it when I attach it, every form is affected by it. Anybody know why? Here is the code:
[17:54:26] <andrew_> https://gist.github.com/ljercha/9097d0f999df03dab1236b33fa7a8ffe
[17:54:39] <codecutter> i need to find last child with data attr foo
[18:09:37] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[18:10:21] <Toerkeium> I'm changing a button's ID with jquery, and if I inspect the element it's shown changed. But I have a selector which still works with that old ID
[18:10:44] <Toerkeium> it's like it changed but for some reason it the selector finds it
[18:10:52] <Toerkeium> any idea why could this happen?
[18:12:08] <Toerkeium> I have <button id="book-213">, change the id with $("#book-123").attr("id", "reserved-123"); and $('button[id^="book-"]').on triggers the script
[18:17:28] <codecutter> after the time is up on line 48, it just goes back to repeatedly adding elements to the dom - http://pastebin.com/Kp9QVa17
[18:17:30] <codecutter> , using the throttle function from underscore js lib http://underscorejs.org/#throttle
[18:21:50] <codecutter> 	the event on line 32 is just a function thats appends data to the dom
[18:23:09] <robertmaxrees> so is your problem with jquery or with underscore?
[18:29:26] <codecutter>  have listener on line 45, which calls an ajax function (line 26), which in turn calls the function on line 70 and appends the data to the dom, problem is with the function on line 75, which for some reason is appending data repeatedly (ajax returns an array 7 object) but this function is repeatedly adding these objects to the dom. I added the throttle function on line 44, which does the job for the time specified
[18:29:26] <codecutter>  but after that it goes back to repeatedly adding dom http://pastebin.com/60g5dJsH
[18:29:55] <codecutter> here is the throttle function http://underscorejs.org/#throttle
[18:30:12] <robertmaxrees> so is your issue with jquery or underscore?
[18:35:18] <codecutter> not sure...
[18:36:50] <Toerkeium> any idea?
[18:38:36] <robertmaxrees> codecutter oh, i think i know what the issue is here.  the code will eventually stop firing.
[18:38:44] <robertmaxrees> scrolls fire a TON of events.
[18:39:31] <codecutter> so whats the fix?
[18:40:01] <robertmaxrees> why are you using throttle?
[18:40:40] <codecutter> it add elements to dom repeadly otherwise
[18:40:50] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:41:59] <codecutter> throttle seems to prevent that for the item specified then goes back
[18:42:06] <codecutter> item*
[18:42:09] <codecutter> time*
[18:42:29] <robertmaxrees> i think you want the debounce.
[18:42:32] <robertmaxrees> but i'm not so sure.
[18:43:34] <codecutter> i think i know i whats going on
[18:45:05] <codecutter> got it
[18:45:10] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[18:46:40] <codecutter> seems to work if I place the function in the html document itself
[18:46:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to do that fwiw.
[18:46:56] <robertmaxrees> if i understand wtf your code is doing.
[18:47:00] <codecutter> i know
[21:12:56] <geri> hi decx
[21:13:36] <geri> decx: can you give me some quick feedback to js coding style?
[21:29:09] <raul782_> Hi guys, when I use $.validator.addClassRules("amount", { matchTotal: 100}); It validates a set of inputs where the sum of the values need to match the total amount.
[21:29:34] <raul782_> However, when one input fails, and the second fixes the sum, the first still has the error message
[21:29:48] <raul782_> how can I clear the first message?
[21:31:26] <raul782_> If I click on the first input the message dissapear, however, I'd like to remove any error message, if the sum matches the total amount.
