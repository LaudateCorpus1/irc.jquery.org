[04:18:46] <karstenk> How can I get the single className from an element which returns true for $(this).is('[class*="div_"]') ?
[04:19:16] <karstenk> the return value should be 'div_company' as example
[04:20:54] <robertmaxrees> why not use data attributes for the value instead?
[04:22:21] <robertmaxrees> karstenk otherwise, you'd need to parse out the .prop('class') for the one that matches, though that'll quickly break down when you have multiples.
[04:43:11] <karstenk> yes, but how to iterate over?
[04:44:14] <karstenk> this.className.split(' ') ?
[04:44:35] <robertmaxrees> basically.  but again.  terrible idea.
[04:44:58] <robertmaxrees> (and it's classList btw)
[04:45:01] <karstenk> ive a look, if i can change markup. thx
[04:45:14] <robertmaxrees> trying to parse out classes is... weird.
[04:45:45] <robertmaxrees> they're not meant to hold info like that.  just to help "group" elements together, sorta.
[05:03:37] <Cork> karstenk: you REALLY shouldn't look for parsial class names, it is better to just use multiple classes instead
[05:03:54] <Cork> (meaning replace "div_" with "div "
[06:40:47] <snake-venom> i have inputs above and some calculation based on above input. but i also want to capture the values of calculation below the form. i am using "keyup" , but its all time giving previous calc value.
[10:21:09] <robertparkerx> for some rason $('ul#shipping_method li:first-child').append('<div class="icon"><i class="info_icon"></i></div>'); isn't working for me
[10:49:04] <robertparkerx> I got it appending but it won't print HTML
[10:54:26] <robertparkerx> https://api.jquery.com/append/
[10:54:30] <robertparkerx> It says it should
[11:10:59] <robertparkerx> okay it won't allow me to append nested html
[11:11:08] <robertparkerx> I can appending just <i></i>
[11:17:44] <robertparkerx> I got it
[11:34:23] <robertparkerx> how can I selector the dyanmic HTML for hover?
[11:39:54] <robertparkerx> I got it
[12:07:18] <snake-venom> i have inputs above and some calculation based on above input. but i also want to capture the values of calculation below the form. i am using "keyup" , but its all time giving previous calc value.
[15:44:27] <SoItBegins> What happens if you feed a null to .when()?
[15:44:30] <SoItBegins> Will it just ignore it?
