[00:04:10] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: one last thing if you dont mind
[00:04:32] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel, yo :)
[00:04:45] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: if you go to www.tobi.com and resize the window to mobile size - what's that type of menu called?
[00:05:03] <robertmaxrees> a hamburger menu
[00:05:11] <cloud69> yeah but
[00:05:21] <cloud69> once you open it :D the whole thing with the content sliding in etc.
[00:05:50] <robertmaxrees> that's called an animation :shrug:
[00:05:53] <cloud69> im trying to make something similar but since i dont know the name i dont know what to google
[00:06:15] <cloud69> "sliding nested menu" or something probably
[00:06:35] <robertmaxrees> :srug: not everything has a name.
[00:07:29] <cloud69> true that
[00:31:39] <cloud69> So I'm trying to recreate the mobile menu at www.tobi.com -- am I doing it right? Anything you guys'd do differently? https://codepen.io/asdfsdasd/pen/poENrwY
[00:32:50] <robertmaxrees> different as in...?
[00:33:43] <cloud69> Just asking for general advice before I go into tunnel mode :)
[00:33:56] <cloud69> I guess it's pretty alright as it is
[00:34:35] <robertmaxrees> 2 things - 1: use uls and lis for lists of things.  2: why not use a frontend framework for this?
[00:35:40] <cloud69> thanks robertmaxrees i'll switch it up
[00:35:48] <cloud69> well, ive decided that for this project i want to do everything from scratch :D
[00:36:07] <robertmaxrees> heh, not everything is worth building from scratch, but okie.
[00:36:14] <cloud69> :D
[00:36:24] <cloud69> not a huge fan of css frameworks either
[00:37:00] <robertmaxrees> why??
[00:37:01] <cloud69> as they force one to mess up ones html with divs inside divs inside divs, and not to mention all the cryptic class names
[00:37:19] <robertmaxrees> they stop being cryptic once you learn them.
[00:37:29] <robertmaxrees> and modern frameworks don't make you suffer from div-itis.
[00:37:40] <cloud69> true, things have come a long way since bootstrap
[00:37:51] <robertmaxrees> even modern bootstrap is better.
[00:37:57] <robertmaxrees> tachyons is another good option.
[00:38:09] <robertmaxrees> but i'd really go with some kind of frontend framework.
[00:38:23] <cloud69> but imho nothing in the html should reference to the style. thats what semantic html is if im not mistaken. so i like to keep markup and styles cleanly separated
[00:38:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[00:38:36] <robertmaxrees> sort of?
[00:38:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not really what semantic markup is heh.
[00:39:43] <robertmaxrees> that's more about using article, section, ul, etc when appropriate.
[00:39:49] <cloud69> aah i see
[00:39:52] <cloud69> cool cool
[00:41:02] <robertmaxrees> also: frameworks and libraries are nice because they solve a large number of foundational problems for you, so you can spend less time worrying about things like browser compat and more time on building things.
[00:41:40] <cloud69> thats a very good point!
[00:42:05] <robertmaxrees> :) what makes doing a fully hand-rolled site so attractive?
[00:43:54] <cloud69> hmm well, the belief that my design will end up better than those frameworks :D which probably aint gonna happen, but it'll be a nice learning experience
[00:43:58] <cloud69> oh and and with a lot less code, cleaner code etc.
[00:44:25] <cloud69> plus im hoping to reuse the css across all my projects
[00:44:28] <robertmaxrees> hrm?  i think you're conflating "using a framework" with "doing design"
[00:44:46] <robertmaxrees> and you can still write clean code when using them.
[00:45:12] <robertmaxrees> also: if reuse is important to you, you're really saying "i want to develop my own framework and/or libraries" ;)
[00:45:39] <cloud69> hehe yeah i guess i am :D
[00:45:54] <robertmaxrees> that's a big trap heh.
[00:46:29] <robertmaxrees> if you're running your own shop, do what you want i guess.  gonna waste a lot of time imho.
[00:46:49] <cloud69> i know :/ it better be worth it
[00:47:08] <robertmaxrees> could leverage collective knowledge instead :shrug:
[00:47:10] <cloud69> youre running your own shop as well?
[00:47:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[00:47:25] <cloud69> oh
[00:47:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm part of a medium-large ecom company.
[00:47:33] <cloud69> nice!
[00:47:55] <cloud69> are you enjoying it?
[00:48:00] <robertmaxrees> greatly :)
[00:48:03] <cloud69> i bet you are, ecommerce is fun :D
[00:48:05] <cloud69> cool
[00:48:18] <robertmaxrees> if any one of my employees tried to hand-roll a framework or w/e, i'd have a lot of questions.
[00:48:24] <cloud69> haha
[00:49:14] <robertmaxrees> we have an internal site scaffolding system that we built but only after testing a LARGE number of other solutions.  our product set is large and varied enough that it wasn't going to work.  that being said, we're still using a ton of 3rd party libraries and frameworks.
[00:49:35] <cloud69> hmmm
[00:50:19] <robertmaxrees> and we have a ton of engineers available - full teams to maintain specific sections.  as well as an entire team just to work on that platform.
[00:50:36] <cloud69> sounds exciting
[00:50:53] <cloud69> may i ask what stuff you sell?
[00:51:00] <robertmaxrees> home improvement.
[00:51:00] <cloud69> or your url even? i totally understand if you wanna remain anon
[00:51:13] <cloud69> ooh nice
[00:51:17] <robertmaxrees> lol my full name is my username - easy to find ;)
[00:51:19] <robertmaxrees> build.com
[00:51:21] <cloud69> hehe
[00:51:25] <cloud69> wait WHAT
[00:51:29] <robertmaxrees> ?
[00:51:54] <cloud69> the name. congrats :D
[00:51:58] <cloud69> oh and your site looks GORGEOUS
[00:52:38] <robertmaxrees> that domain was through a very, very expensive acquisition.  and thanks :)
[00:52:42] <cloud69> everything about the design just clicks
[00:52:57] <cloud69> :D
[00:53:04] <cloud69> i see you're not using any sliders as well lol
[00:53:10] <robertmaxrees> eh, it's got some issues.  we're refining it bigtime right now.  we're doing a massive migration to that system I mentioned.  it's going to get a lot more cohesive.
[00:53:26] <robertmaxrees> we have some old sites that use them.  user engagement on them is non-existent.
[00:53:31] <robertmaxrees> huge waste of space.
[00:57:44] <cloud69> i cant wait to see how it turns out :D
[01:00:43] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: mind if i ask how you got started?
[01:00:53] <cloud69> like did you start small operating outta your own flat, or did you have investor backing?
[01:01:05] * cloud69 is the former :P
[01:02:18] <robertmaxrees> neither.  i didn't found the company or anything.  got my start doing data entry and then moved into building out frontends for a whitelabel newspaper advertising company.
[01:02:57] <robertmaxrees> transitioned from there to build 7 and a half years ago.
[01:04:55] <cloud69> very cool
[01:05:13] <cloud69> you must be superbusy right now with the whole christmas shopping craze going on i reckon
[01:05:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.  super dead.
[01:05:32] <cloud69> thats odd
[01:05:45] <robertmaxrees> nah - people do all their improvement ahead of thanksgiving.
[01:05:53] <robertmaxrees> ahead of dinner parties and family visits and all that.
[01:06:20] <cloud69> makes sense
[01:06:24] <robertmaxrees> we then see a huge surge on cyber monday and then it dips way low.  people aren't spending their christmas holiday buying our stuff - that's going to other retail.
[01:06:35] <cloud69> indeed
[01:06:40] <robertmaxrees> though this year has been crazy.  we've been pulling insanely good numbers during the pandemic.
[01:06:49] <cloud69> hehe :D
[01:07:30] <cloud69> yup, its all over the news too. "we're buying more online than ever before!" type of headlines
[01:08:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  our demo is the type that has cash right now to spend.  plus real estate is cheap.  people moving means they want to improve their new space and fix up the old.
[01:11:11] <cloud69> ever consider going into multiple niches? like just copying the build.com source and rebranding it?
[01:11:29] <robertmaxrees> lol that's how we started.
[01:11:39] <robertmaxrees> people want a one-stop solution.
[01:12:02] <cloud69> what do you mean?
[01:12:54] <robertmaxrees> the first site was just plumbing.  then we added flooring, HVAC, etc.  then we hosted all of those as well as one with everything.
[01:13:02] <cloud69> aaah
[01:13:04] <robertmaxrees> people came to and stayed with the single one.
[01:13:13] <cloud69> i understand
[01:13:55] <cloud69> well, as long as it's all home appliances
[01:14:01] <robertmaxrees> you're not going to visit a store that just sells plumbing supplies unless you're a contractor.  but if you can find one with plumbing and everything else?
[01:14:10] <robertmaxrees> home appliances are a funny business.
[01:14:28] <robertmaxrees> we do a lot of stuff with developers - hotels and stuff.
[01:14:37] <robertmaxrees> as well as homeowners doing major remodels.
[01:16:02] <cloud69> architects and interior designers too im guessing
[01:16:13] <robertmaxrees> not many architects directly.
[01:16:23] <cloud69> ah
[01:16:33] <robertmaxrees> designers, a bit.  they usually get involved with projects via one of our tools.
[01:18:06] <cloud69> man im just loaded with questions! but i'll let you go for now :)
[01:18:19] <cloud69> i gotta get back to store building if there's any chance im gonna cash in on the christmas shopping
[01:19:12] <cloud69> gonna use your site as my role model lol
[01:19:28] <cloud69> that and www.arngren.net ofcourse
[01:19:38] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: later, thanks again for all the advice
[01:19:53] <robertmaxrees> haha, good times.  cheers!
[04:55:56] <mulch2> how can we target a datatable row before the table is visible?
[04:56:18] <mulch2> (document).ready is too soon, apparently -- getting "undefined"
[04:56:41] <mulch2> the table is being loaded dynamically.
[04:57:34] <Cork> try $(document).on('load', {})
[04:57:59] <Cork> but if the table is generated asycnronally you have to check if they have an event or callback
[05:01:11] <mulch2> ah, okay
[05:02:34] <mulch2> it's a music player's queue, so i think there's a callback -- i saw callback functions in the code.
[05:02:40] <mulch2> (thanks, btw)
[05:03:37] <mulch2> i'm just trying to retrieve column data to display it in a div
[07:02:20] <mulch2> Cork -- your help worked :))
[07:03:13] <mulch2> i had to change document to window, but then i was able to target the datatable contents.
[07:10:07] <Cork> nice
[23:55:51] <robertparkerx> https://url.hashdev.org/4u this works on staging but not on live. It's in app.js. My other handlers work with the optimization I have. I'm not sure why this doesn't.
[23:56:25] <robertmaxrees> do those elements exist on pageload?
[23:56:32] <robertparkerx> yes
[23:56:45] <robertmaxrees> what about them "doesn't work"
[23:56:54] <robertparkerx> it doesn't flip on click for mobile
[23:57:21] <robertparkerx> well it doesn't flip on desktop either
[23:57:26] <robertparkerx> it does on staging
[23:57:28] <robertmaxrees> did you check to see if they're firing at all?  when you say "on staging but not on live", did you check on the same mobile device against both environments?  is cache cleared in all cases?
[23:57:39] <robertparkerx> yes
[23:57:44] <robertmaxrees> without knowing the differences between your environments, it's really hard to know what the cause is.
[23:58:30] <robertmaxrees> also: you could put all of those within $('.flip-card').on('mouseenter mouseleave click', function() {
