[00:06:43] <pzuraq> for some reason my regex is turning any string larger than 7 characters into 0
[00:07:52] <gry> By all means please expect us to be psychic and guess the issue by this description.
[00:08:21] <Cork> you mean you can't psychically see his regex just from him saying he has problem with it? :D
[00:08:33] <pzuraq> n.toString().split( /(?=(?:\d{3})+(?:\.|$))/g ).join( "," );
[00:08:41] <gry> Cork: No, no. We can.
[00:08:47] <pzuraq> I actually tried two different ones that did the same thing
[00:08:52] <pzuraq> figured it might be a common problem
[00:09:06] <Cork> pzuraq: and an example of the data?
[00:09:21] <pzuraq> and string of numbers longer than 7 digits
[00:09:32] <pzuraq> any string longer than 7 chars really
[00:09:40] <pzuraq> automatically becomes 0
[00:09:59] <Cork> > print("123456789".split( /(?=(?:\d{3})+(?:\.|$))/g ).join( "," );)
[00:10:06] <Cork> js> print("123456789".split( /(?=(?:\d{3})+(?:\.|$))/g ).join( "," ))
[00:10:12] <b-ot> Cork: 123,456,789
[00:10:18] <Cork> works fine here
[00:10:26] <pzuraq> might have something to do with Ember then...
[00:10:27] <pzuraq> damn
[00:17:07] <mazzachre> What is the preffered way of selecting elements by a class that is given as option? $('.'+options.class) or how?
[00:17:37] <martisj> is there a way to trigger a file input click event when clicking an anchor on the page?
[00:17:44] <Cork> mazzachre: have them include the dot in the string
[00:17:52] <martisj> chrome crashes and says somehting about the target not being reachable.
[00:18:02] <Cork> martisj: yes, .click()
[00:18:10] <martisj> don't work Cork
[00:19:32] <Cork> mazzachre: what i mean was that don't ask them for a class, ask them for a selector
[00:20:46] <Cork> martisj: works just fine here http://jsfiddle.net/2LSCS/
[00:21:15] <Cork> or if you prefer http://jsfiddle.net/2LSCS/1/
[00:22:41] <martisj> Cork: i'm doing something wrong on my end then.
[00:29:56] <martisj> Cork: it works now
[00:30:02] <martisj> i moved the input above the link.
[00:30:04] <martisj> that's weird
[00:31:54] <mazzachre> Cork: But I use the class in other contexts, like adding and removing it from elements based on conditions... So I use the same pref in both selection and in add/remove Class functions
[00:32:08] <Cork> ah
[00:32:24] <Cork> mazzachre: then yes, that is more or less the only way to handle it
[00:32:36] <mazzachre> Also, it is part of a combined selector... Like $('.myClass :checked', myContext)
[00:34:33] <mazzachre> In a completely different issue, but related to same code
[00:35:54] <mazzachre> I have some issues with "slideUp/slideDown" functionality... While it usually works, sometimes it leaves a trace of the slided elements as a line below the elements it have hidden... This is likely a browser issue, right?
[00:36:52] <Cork> mazzachre: sounds like a rendering error ya
[00:38:36] <ravenzz> mazzachre try transform: translate3d(0,0,0)
[00:39:10] <systemfault> It also happened to me in the past… that sucks (It seems to happen mostly on chrome :/)
[00:39:35] <ravenzz> and the prefied ones if needed
[00:39:43] <Cork> ravenzz: careful with those, they can cause the browser to render a gigantic area (and consume a LOT of memory)
[00:40:14] <Cork> should be fixed in the later versions, but a bit back it was quite ugly
[00:40:23] <mazzachre> Hmm... only problem is, I am forced to have IE and firefox support...
[00:41:01] <Cork> mazzachre: what does that have to do with it?
[00:42:03] <mazzachre> translate3d is not supported...
[00:42:04] <ravenzz> Cork I know, I try to avoid GPU rendering
[00:42:26] <Cork> ravenzz: well the 2d ones is normally fune
[00:42:31] <Cork> *fine
[00:43:00] <Cork> except for rotate that is
[01:07:38] <otiuk> i have a button in a div with a class (.box) and there is another .box hidden after the one with the button.. how can i have the button show the next .box div i am trying: $(this).next('.box').show();
[01:08:46] <Cork> otiuk: $(this).closest('.box').nextAll('.box').first().show();
[01:09:20] <Cork> .nextAll('.box').first() can become .next() if the following .box element is directly after the first one
[01:12:29] <otiuk> ya it's right after the current .box
[01:13:02] <imjakechapman> anyone know of a quick regex to catch a / for the root url?
[01:13:27] <Cork> imjakechapman: you mean if the string starts with a / ?
[01:13:38] <imjakechapman> yea
[01:13:44] <Cork> string[0] == '/'
[01:13:55] <Cork> doesn't get faster then that
[01:14:08] <imjakechapman> well I have to do it in a regex for a Route in laravel
[01:14:12] <Cork> but /^\// should work too
[01:14:15] <seutje> I'm sure there some bitshift magic to make it even better :P
[01:14:26] <seutje> there's*
[01:14:48] <Cork> seutje: not for a string
[01:14:51] <imjakechapman> :(
[01:15:09] <Cork> imjakechapman: ?
[01:15:12] <seutje> yes, for once it doesn't pay off to be adept at the black arts of bit shifting
[01:15:24] <Cork> :)
[01:52:19] <otiuk> is there a way to tell if anything is being typed into a text field.. i have a disabled button that i want to enable the second anything is typed into the field
[01:54:36] <Cork> otiuk: keyup
[01:54:49] <bealtine> or maybe keypress
[01:55:12] <Cork> bealtine: keypress is deprecated, and keyup does the same thing as keypress
[01:55:26] <Cork> ?g mdn keypress
[01:55:26] <b-ot> Cork: keypress - Web technology reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/keypress
[01:55:27] <bot-t> Cork, keypress - Web technology reference | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/keypress
[01:55:32] <bealtine> ok
[01:55:54] <otiuk> ok that'd be good and what would be a good event for checkboxes/select/radio buttons?
[01:55:56] <Cork> it messes with my old programmer mind, but... ya >_>
[01:56:18] <Cork> otiuk: keyup + click
[01:56:34] <Cork> otiuk: or if you're ok with a bit of a lag you can use .change
[01:56:36] <joker_89> hi
[01:56:43] <Cork> (for all of them)
[01:56:51] <otiuk> ya wanted to avoid the lag if possible
[01:57:05] <joker_89> why i recive this error: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal @ http://mypage.com/js/jquery-1.9.1.min.js:20
[01:57:08] <joker_89> from jquery :S
[01:57:47] <Cork> joker_89: most likely cause you have code earlier in your page that fails to evaluate
[01:57:55] <otiuk> but is it ok to connect those events to the same class name?  each element that has .req i want it to have disabled button until either text is in a text/textarea or when something is selected for select,radio,checkbox,etc
[01:58:21] <joker_89> code early?
[01:58:22] <Cork> otiuk: you don't connect events to class names, you connect them to elements, matched by a classname
[01:58:23] <joker_89> ok
[01:58:35] <otiuk> ya that's what i meant
[01:58:51] <Cork> otiuk: and the best way to handle it is to delegate it
[01:59:05] <Cork> that way you don't have to have an event handler on every element (just the common parent)
[01:59:33] <otiuk> can you give me an example what you mean by delegating it?
[02:00:05] <Cork> ?.delegate
[02:00:06] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:00:26] <Cork> otiuk: .on has a delegate syntax too, but you need to read up on it a little see ?.on
[02:00:27] <bot-t> otiuk, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:03:06] <joker_89> Cork I dont have any code before to evaluate
[02:03:21] <Cork> joker_89: do you have a link?
[02:04:04] <bealtine> i "include" jquery with no problems
[02:04:35] <bealtine> so it's something at your end
[02:05:10] <joker_89> http://pastebin.com/nSNDb5Hx
[02:05:14] <joker_89> this is before code
[02:06:17] <otiuk> Cork: is the best way to enable a button to just do a .removeAttr('disabled')?
[02:06:29] <Cork> otiuk: no
[02:06:36] <Cork> prop('disabled', true/false)
[02:06:40] <Cork> NEVER use attr
[02:06:55] <Cork> then you want to work with properties of the dom element that is
[02:07:35] <Cork> bealtine: and the url loads?
[02:07:51] <Cork> bealtine: btw, i suspect you have an invalid doctype for your page
[02:08:29] <Cork> bealtine: that doctype is invalid unless you send the header content-type: application/xhtml+xml
[02:08:37] <bealtine> eh:)
[02:08:38] <Cork> and then the page wouldn't load in older ie
[02:08:52] <Cork> bealtine: xhtml isn't text/html
[02:09:00] <AdamPDotty> you can negotiate that in apache
[02:09:12] <bealtine> joker_89 i think you mean:)
[02:09:33] <Cork> yes but the fact is that 99.9999% of all that uses xhtml doctype is just sending broken html
[02:10:41] <joker_89> what?
[02:11:42] <Cork> joker_89: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> is only valid if you send the response as content-type: application/xhtml+xml
[02:12:01] <Cork> if you don't then you just send plain html 4, with errors
[02:12:24] <Cork> (and you would be better of just replacing it with <!doctype html>)
[02:14:42] <joker_89> the problem
[02:14:48] <joker_89> not solved xd
[02:16:33] <Krambiorix> hi, i have a div with a click event on it. In that div i have li's with other click events on it. When i click the li the pages redirects to the url on the div click event and not to the location on the li click event... How can i solve this?
[02:17:29] <mrHAT> first of all, my apologies to whoever sugested on i should use some kind javascript templating like underscore 2 days ago
[02:17:37] <Cork> Krambiorix: on the divs url?!?
[02:17:39] <mrHAT> it really cleaned up my code
[02:20:29] <mrHAT> don´t know if improoves performance but it looks better and more mantainable
[02:20:30] <mrHAT> heh
[02:22:59] <Tomashe> hey guys there is a way to make animation and then url change?

[02:27:44] <Krambiorix> Cork, click events with redirect
[02:28:06] <Cork> Krambiorix: what do you mean by redirects?
[02:28:14] <Cork> js doens't have redirect
[02:28:50] <Krambiorix> Cork, location.href = ''
[02:29:15] <Cork> it is just an event handler that changes the current location
[02:29:19] <Cork> not a redirect
[02:29:40] <Krambiorix> Cork, ok sry
[02:29:54] <Cork> Krambiorix: guessing a bit i think that your problem is from bubbling events
[02:30:11] <Cork> try using event.stopPropagation(); in the deepest click handlers
[02:31:03] <Krambiorix> Cork, still same problem

[02:41:56] <Krambiorix> Cork,  no difference

[02:42:36] <Krambiorix> forgot event parameter
[02:42:40] <Krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[02:46:03] <mrHAT> ok, so i'm trying to setup a fiddle but something goes wrong.. what am i missing ?
[02:46:03] <mrHAT> http://jsfiddle.net/3td2e/1/
[02:47:01] <mrHAT> sorry
[02:47:06] <mrHAT> forget about it ..
[02:47:13] <mrHAT> i missplaced something
[02:47:13] <mrHAT> http://jsfiddle.net/3td2e/1/
[02:47:26] <mrHAT> http://jsfiddle.net/3td2e/2/ this is the final revision
[02:47:59] <mrHAT> my question is.. how do i loop trough array inventory() and place that into the template
[02:48:17] <Cork> mrHAT: you're trying to loop a string
[02:48:22] <dwarder> what event occurs when a text between <div id='smthing'>text here changes</div> changes?
[02:48:38] <Cork> dwarder: none
[02:48:43] <otiuk> cork: whats the best way to tell if the item that activated the change event is a checkbox?
[02:48:46] <mrHAT> yes.. sorry .. Cork now it works : http://jsfiddle.net/3td2e/2/
[02:48:47] <Cork> there is no event for dom content changes
[02:49:11] <dwarder> Cork: check for change every n seconds then?
[02:49:21] <Cork> otiuk: $(event.target).is(':checkbox')
[02:49:43] <Cork> dwarder: no, have the code changing the dom trigger a callback
[02:49:51] <otiuk> so I could do if($(this).is(':checkbox')) {
[02:50:14] <Cork> that is one way to do it yes
[02:50:54] <Tomashe> anyone ever did wookmark animation reoprdering?
[02:51:04] <Cork> mrHAT: AllHtml += _ <-- isn't a variable
[02:51:28] <mrHAT> ?
[02:51:58] <mrHAT> _.template() is from the underscore helper im using for the templating
[02:52:02] <Cork> opps forget that it was me not loading a required lib
[02:52:08] <dwarder> Cork: this is a userscript for tempermonkey
[02:52:11] <Cork> mrHAT: so, what is the question?
[02:52:17] <dwarder> Cork: that i'm trying to write
[02:52:17] <Cork> dwarder: yes i know
[02:52:29] <Cork> bah, read wrong...
[02:52:45] <Cork> dwarder: userscript could assume a modern browser
[02:52:59] <dwarder> darknyan: i use chrome
[02:53:07] <dwarder> Cork: *

[02:53:22] <mrHAT> well.. as you can see in the object i have another 'array' 1 level deep , "inventory" .. that i would like to get the results from on each row and don't know how to do it
[02:53:26] <Cork> it won't work in older browsers though
[02:54:03] <dwarder> thanks
[02:54:03] <mrHAT> inside #catalog-tiendas-stocks-table
[02:54:27] <Cork> mrHAT: why are you using an object and not an array for that?
[02:54:35] <mrHAT> don't know how recursion should work here.. is the first time im using a templating sistem...
[02:54:55] <mrHAT> well.. that json string is what i'm getting from the server
[02:55:26] <Cork> ya, and cause the server is sending it in a list based from 1 instead of 0 you get an object instead of an array
[02:55:30] <mrHAT> dont know if its good to iterate directly into the template
[02:56:24] <mrHAT> so right now 100 rows will be returned
[02:57:01] <mrHAT> inside the template i could iterate trough "inventory" for each row but is that the best way to do it ?
[02:57:06] <Cork> mrHAT: you should start by fixing the structure
[02:57:14] <Cork> that would make looping it a bit simpler
[02:57:39] <mrHAT> you have seen this: var response = $.parseJSON(... right ?
[02:58:10] <mrHAT> what i'm getting from the server is directly the object
[02:58:15] <Cork> no
[02:58:31] <Cork> the server is sending the data as 1:, 2:, 3:, 4:
[02:58:38] <Cork> instaed of 0:, 1:, 2:, 3:
[02:58:40] <mrHAT> yes sorry
[02:59:02] <Cork> that results in you not getting an array for the data that should be an array
[02:59:03] <mrHAT> im using php as a backend and im doing a json_encode() (probably you know that allready)
[02:59:13] <mrHAT> how exactly do you want that array to be ?
[02:59:24] <Cork> make sure it is 0 based and not 1 based...
[02:59:29] <Cork> like i've sad over and over again
[02:59:34] <mrHAT> yes
[02:59:40] <mrHAT> the server returns 0 based
[02:59:46] <Cork> no it doens't
[02:59:59] <Cork> "inventory":{"1":"0","2":"0","3":"0","4":"23"} <--
[03:00:04] <Cork> it starts at 1 not 0
[03:00:09] <mrHAT> ahh .. that is something else
[03:00:14] <mrHAT> that has to be like that
[03:00:26] <Cork> hmm
[03:00:30] <mrHAT> the numeric keys are not random.. it correspond to something
[03:00:37] <mrHAT> that order has to be like that
[03:00:45] <mrHAT> it could have been 63,283,828
[03:00:48] <mrHAT> ..
[03:01:13] <Cork> "inventory":{ >"1"< :"0", >"2"< :"0", >"3"< :"0", >"4"< :"23"} <--
[03:01:35] <otiuk> Cork: is the best way to get a changed range field using .change?
[03:01:56] <mrHAT> Cork : why did you highlighted that ?
[03:02:01] <Cork> otiuk: ugg not sure, i haven't used it much, but i think yes
[03:02:13] <Cork> mrHAT: cause it isn't random at all
[03:02:24] <Cork> the keys is just 1 based, and that cause it to not be an array
[03:02:52] <mrHAT> those are the primary kjeys from a database table and they could be any nuymber....
[03:03:02] <mrHAT> its just casual they are in order now and start from 1
[03:03:33] <Cork> mrHAT: then you would have to dig through the object functions and find a way to handle it there http://underscorejs.org/#objects
[03:04:32] <mrHAT> but where do i handle all this
[03:04:38] <mrHAT> inside the template directly ?
[03:04:39] <Cork> in the template
[03:05:05] <mrHAT> it will be extra work on each row.. this will slow things down damn it.. :(
[03:06:15] <mrHAT> think i will do things in the backend
[03:07:34] <mrHAT> what if i return it as a numeric indexed array (starting from 0)
[03:07:46] <mrHAT> then i could simple iterate with $.each ?
[03:08:01] <mrHAT> alltrough i think i can do that allready
[03:17:13] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/sSUNg/
[03:17:27] <Tomashe> anyone know why this animatoin function inside wookmark plugin just get ingnored?

[03:18:33] <mrHAT> http://jsfiddle.net/3td2e/3/
[03:18:41] <mrHAT> this is what i came up with
[03:18:56] <mrHAT> inside template #catalog-tiendas-stocks-table
[03:18:59] <mrHAT> but i don't like it
[03:20:14] <mrHAT> what do you say
[03:32:30] <Deele> anyone here using twitter bootstrap?
[03:32:53] <Deele> anyway
[03:33:01] <crab> i use it
[03:33:20] <Deele> when setting up event on dom element, will it catch event with same name, if it accoured in child element too?
[03:35:00] <dfdsf> native js statement window.opener.document.getVolunteerDetails(); does not run.how can i do this in jquery?
[03:35:05] <Deele> I mean, if I have boostrap modal with boostrap collapse inside, both have events hidden, and when collapse hidden event fires, modal event is fired too
[03:36:20] <Deele> maybe, I have set up event catcher with wrong selector...
[03:36:57] <Deele> I created modal HTML with jquery, and initiated modal directly on object
[03:37:19] <Deele> and set up event catcher in same manner
[03:40:05] <otiuk> Cork: can you select an element if it has two classes like $('.class1 .class2') ?
[03:51:40] <Deele> otiuk yes, but without space between
[03:52:13] <Deele> same as you do div.class1 or input[type="text"]
[03:52:50] <otiuk> oh ok.. cool ya i just tested it with the space and without lol thanks :)
[04:00:03] <otiuk> Deele: do you know the easiest way to check if any values are checked for any checkboxes with the same name? .. like they are named chkbx[] .. and i wanna do an change event and tell if there are any selected or not..
[04:07:17] <Cork> otiuk: $('input[name="chkbx[]"]:checked')
[04:15:20] <otiuk> Cork: it returns an object how can i tell if there are any selected or not?  like if i wanted to do if($('input[name="chkbx[]"]:checked') { do something } else { do something else }
[04:19:56] <Cork> otiuk: $('input[name="chkbx[]"]:checked').length > 0
[04:25:24] <AlexIT> Hello, could anyone spend a little time to help me fix a problem in jquery?
[04:25:24] <_rgn> obj.is(':checked')
[04:27:06] <AlexIT> Anyone? Please?
[04:28:23] <Cork> ?ask @ Alexer
[04:28:23] <b-ot> Alexer: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[04:28:24] <Cork> opps
[04:28:27] <Cork> *AlexIT:
[04:28:58] <otiuk> AlexIT: just ask :)
[04:29:09] <sammich> asss-k
[04:29:18] <AlexIT> okay, thanks ( Putting all the code in paste bin cause its way too long for irc)
[04:29:54] * sammich breathes a sigh of relief
[04:31:27] <otiuk> hahaha sammich, you had to figure a full paste in the channel would have been next.. but alas nope
[04:31:48] <AlexIT> http://pastebin.com/cBi6n3Lj / I need help making the .click event (Focus on ID #b2) trigger automatically, not when I click in this page.
[04:32:09] <sammich> yeah, that one would've been hard to read
[04:32:18] <AlexIT> xD
[04:32:28] <Cork> AlexIT: if you want to fake an event just do $(target).click();
[04:32:43] <Cork> where target is the selector/element you want the event on
[04:33:12] <AlexIT> you... made my brain go boom (Been struggling for about .. 3 hours?) lol.
[04:33:51] <sammich> yeah that
[04:35:05] <AlexIT> My problem is basically with the checkbox, Simple code doesn't work tried about.. every variation I can find on the internet
[04:36:10] <AlexIT> $('#checkutilizator1').click(function(){ if (this.checked)
[04:36:29] <Cork> uh...
[04:37:21] <Cork> AlexIT: first of please give a live demo and not a dead code dump http://jsfiddle.net/hGuu9/2/
[04:37:30] <otiuk> may be better to say what you are trying to do
[04:37:57] <Cork> (side note your html structure is invalid)
[04:38:45] <AlexIT> Okay trying to upload there.
[04:39:06] <bluesm> What is the proper form
[04:39:21] <bluesm> .append("<div>"); or  append("<div/>");
[04:39:36] <AlexIT> ow
[04:39:38] <Cork> bluesm: .append('<div></div>')
[04:40:08] <Cork> bluesm: $() has special code to handle <div> and <div/>
[04:40:15] <AlexIT> Well cork, on the collon C2 you will see there's a checkbox, I need to click and unclick that for it to take effect and update the colon B2 (I'm basically copying a program from an excel one)
[04:40:16] <Cork> but append expects valid html
[04:41:04] <bluesm> Cork: Ok. But if the were less "liberal" what they would delete ?
[04:41:41] <sammich> your browser takes a best guess?
[04:41:49] <Cork> AlexIT:
[04:41:49] <Cork> <AlexIT> Okay trying to upload there.
[04:41:50] <Cork> opps
[04:41:55] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/hGuu9/3/
[04:42:04] <Cork> stupid copy buffer...
[04:42:10] <AlexIT> Cork:Well cork, on the collon C2 you will see there's a checkbox, I need to click and unclick that for it to take effect and update the colon B2 (I'm basically copying a program from an excel one)
[04:42:40] <AlexIT> I want to not have to click and unclick it and the if function to trigger automatically
[04:42:42] <Cork> bluesm: you would trigger the browsers error correction code path and it would try to guess where the end tag should be
[04:43:18] <Cork> AlexIT: ok, if you don't want to actually trigger the event, you need to make the function a named function, and then run the function on load
[04:43:24] <bluesm> Cork: To me ?
[04:43:42] <Cork> bluesm: the first was yes
[04:44:01] <Musk> Anyone ever gotten into the problem where JQM css style is not being applied unto your elements ?
[04:44:31] <AlexIT> Cork: Haven't done any programming in jquery before,(I do program in c++ however), could you show me an example of a very simple and basic named function?
[04:44:32] <Cork> bluesm: if you add broken html, the browser will try to figure out how to fix it by the error correction code
[04:44:53] <Cork> Alexer: function a_named_function() {}
[04:44:56] <Cork> bah
[04:44:59] <Cork> *AlexIT:
[04:45:18] <sammich> you need a better IRC client, Cork ;)
[04:45:23] <AlexIT> Thanks, I'll try working on it!
[04:45:25] <Cork> there is too many ppl in here starting with the same 3 letters...
[04:45:37] <Cork> sammich: or smaller channel :)
[04:45:41] <otiuk> hah
[04:45:44] <bluesm> Cork: But I asked about the preffered way to insert empty div
[04:45:45] <bluesm>  .append("<div>"); or  append("<div/>");
[04:45:57] <sammich> well at least mine uses the most recent activity first
[04:45:57] <Cork> bluesm: and i answered
[04:46:03] <Cork> <Cork> bluesm: .append('<div></div>')
[04:46:08] <otiuk> lol
[04:46:11] <Cork> that is the only way to make a valid insert
[04:46:34] <sammich> how about....append($('<div/>)) ;)
[04:46:50] <Cork> sure, kinda pointless but valid
[04:47:05] <sammich> hence the winky face
[04:47:09] <Cork> you can do append(document.createElement('div')) too
[04:47:13] <bluesm> Cork: Why ?
[04:47:19] <bluesm> Cork: Append uses innerHtml ?
[04:47:25] <sammich> like he said, .append() expects valid HTML
[04:47:38] <Cork> bluesm: cause <div/> isn't valid html it gets interpreted as <div> and <div> isn't a closed html tag
[04:48:04] <Cork> so the browser will look at the rest of the string and guess where the close tag SHOULD have been
[04:48:36] <Cork> bluesm: $() actually have regex looking for those tags and runs document.createElement for those cases
[04:48:38] <bluesm> Cork: But it doesn't matter. It is just argument to the jQuery. I do not insert it to the page directly.
[04:48:50] <Cork> bluesm: it is
[04:49:51] <Cork> bluesm: most jquery functions is just a thin wrapper around the normal dom commands
[04:50:05] <bluesm> Cork: You said that seconds ago  that "have regex looking for those tags and runs document.createElement" so I do not insert directly
[04:50:15] <Cork> with expection for css, and the class, .on and so on
[04:50:31] <Cork> bluesm: that was about $() not .append
[04:52:07] <otiuk> haha Cork you can thank sammich for that haha
[04:52:21] <Cork> ^^'
[04:52:34] <sammich> aww, you can't go jQuery('body').prepend('<!--')
[04:52:54] <Cork> sam452: <!-- isn't a tag
[04:53:15] <Cork> <!-- (what ever) -->   is a tag
[04:53:22] <bluesm> Cork Ok. Thanks :)
[04:53:23] <Cork> (self closing one)
[04:53:41] <Cork> bluesm: np
[04:54:00] <sammich> hah. Well, sorry ;)
[04:54:28] <Cork> sammich: no prob, i was talking about $() and .append anyway
[04:54:36] <Cork> so i would have mentioned the difference anyway
[04:54:51] <sammich> not so sure about our friend
[04:57:06] <AlexIT> Cork: would this be correct?          if ($('#checkutilizator1').checked)
[04:57:16] <Cork> no
[04:57:25] <Cork> $('#checkutilizator1').prop('checked
[04:57:32] * Cork HATES ' ...
[04:57:39] <Cork> * $('#checkutilizator1').prop('checked')
[04:57:46] <sammich> not .is('checked')?
[04:57:51] <Cork> no
[04:57:53] <AlexIT> Alright, thanks :)
[04:58:00] <Cork> it would be .is(':checked')
[04:58:06] <sammich> yeah, that :p
[04:58:08] <Cork> but that gives extra work for no reason
[04:58:15] <sammich> fair enough
[04:58:29] <Farid> Hi there
[04:58:57] <Cork> .is will trigger sizzle, and sizzle will pares :checked, and find the function checked, and checked will be ran and it will check elm.checked
[04:59:09] <Farid> I have coule of tds in a table.. which have ids like a123 and b123........ how can i remove these two ids from the table using jquery
[04:59:15] <AlexIT> I fail horribly :/
[04:59:17] <sammich> what else are computers for.
[04:59:20] <Cork> whil prop('checked') just checks this.getProperty('checked')
[04:59:28] <Farid> this is what i am trying to do
[04:59:29] <Farid> "#a" + id.fadeOut('slow', function() {$(this).remove();});
[04:59:52] <sammich> do you have the selector around that id?
[05:00:03] <sammich> $("#a" + id)...
[05:00:04] <Cork> Farid: $('#a123, #b123').fadeOut
[05:00:51] <Cork> Farid: id's isn't to make range selections, so they are a bit inefficient
[05:01:12] <Cork> most of the time a class is what you want; though not sure if that is the case for this one
[05:01:33] <Farid> i can change the id to class
[05:02:11] <sammich> wonder how slow [id=some_id] is compared
[05:02:20] <Cork> Farid: what i meant is if you have <td id="<char>number"> and you want to remove all columns with number; you should have <td class="<char> number"> instead
[05:02:38] <Cork> sammich: but then you lose every reason to use an id
[05:02:52] <Cork> cause that is an attribute selector, not an id selector
[05:03:01] <sammich> still curious
[05:03:54] <sahbeewah> that would be significantly slower
[05:04:02] <Cork> sam452: $('[id="some_id"]') would do about the same thing as $('*').filter('[id="some_id"]')
[05:04:29] <Farid> Cork, in this case id is fine... considering i have delete button in one column and text in the other.. so when the delete button is cliked i remove the td wiht text and the td with the delete image.
[05:04:41] <Cork> and that would be about the same thing as $('*').filter(function() { return this.getAttribute('id') == 'some_id'; })
[05:05:31] <Cork> Farid: but why don't you just do $('table').on('click', 'button', function() { $(this).closest('tr').remove(); }); ?
[05:05:42] <fn> if i do an ajax request on http://domain.tpl for the folder "foo", how do i write it down for request from http://domain.tpl/bar to folder domain.tpl/foo ?
[05:05:55] <Farid> I have just tried what sammich suggested.. and it works for me
[05:06:15] <Cork> fn: '/foo'
[05:06:17] <sammich> dammit, I knew that would happen
[05:06:33] <Cork> Farid: works, and works well; is two different things
[05:06:50] <Farid> Cork because i am stupid and i have 4 tds in one row.. two with text and two with delete button  :D
[05:07:09] <Cork> Farid: and no desire to learn how to make things scale?
[05:07:25] <sammich> forgive me, my first jsperf http://jsperf.com/id-vs-id1234
[05:07:35] <Farid> Cork, I am at that  stage of teh project where I just want to finish it, launch it and get paid for it. :)
[05:07:58] <Cork> Farid: and then get a bad reputation for slow code...
[05:08:07] <fn> Cork: doesn't work for me
[05:08:11] <fn> did i forgott something?
[05:08:26] <Cork> fn: you didn't say much about what you where trying to do
[05:08:44] <Farid> I agree with you ... but i am desprate right now
[05:08:44] <Cork> so don't expect the answer to be spot on
[05:08:51] <sammich> putting a slash leading URL means it starts from the root of the domain
[05:09:23] <Cork> fn: you didn't even say where you where trying to access the folder
[05:09:28] <Cork> or what you where trying to do
[05:09:49] <fn> let me try something, if it doesn't work, i paste it online
[05:09:54] <Cork> only that you want a reference from one url to another
[05:10:21] <Farid> Thank you guys... I will be back when I will feel guilty about doing a short cut... and ask for a better solution :)
[05:12:06] <fn> Cork: http://pastie.org/private/qfhkyk39sjzdl0xbn7dq
[05:12:09] <fn> this is it
[05:12:34] <Cork> ok
[05:13:13] <sammich> you want /dev/like...
[05:13:24] <Cork> fn: you are accessing /like/?entry=/something/ instead of /something/like/?entry=
[05:13:36] <sammich> what you have there is looking for http://domain.com/like/?entry
[05:14:10] <fn> okey
[05:14:17] <sammich> you can typically see the error in console
[05:14:24] <sammich> pretty obviously
[05:14:33] <sammich> because it's looking up the wrong URL
[05:14:42] <Cork> well obvious if you know what the server expects
[05:14:59] <Cork> how an url is formatted is basically up to the server though
[05:15:08] <Cork> so it is hard to guess
[05:15:28] <sammich> well, isn't there the correct URL below the 2 links?
[05:16:17] <Cork> sammich: ya, but i'm not sure if the "url" section is meant to go to entry or in the url for the script
[05:18:47] <sammich> not sure if that's the problem at hand though
[05:19:00] <Cork> me nether, that was kind the point :)
[05:19:34] <sammich> pretty sure it's just a relative linkage problem
[05:20:34] <nawi> using jquery mobile, .on('tap') and .on('taphold') seem to work, but .on'(tap taphold') doesn't fire for tap hold at all, only tap. testing on android
[05:21:23] <sammich> wonder if they're mutually exclusive events
[05:22:05] <nawi> UX suffers if I only use tap, since slightly longer "taps" don't do anything
[05:22:55] <Cork> nawi: tap and taphold is both jqm fake events, so i would recommend having a look at where they actually come from
[05:23:44] <Cork> i remember looking into it a while back, but i don't remember how they where actually built up
[05:24:12] <arschmitz> tap and taphold are not mutually exclusive
[05:24:14] <sammich> works here
[05:24:22] <arschmitz> and should work bound the way described
[05:24:27] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/YGbyS/
[05:24:51] <arschmitz> there will be an option to make them mutually exclusive in the 1.4 version which will be in alpha next week
[05:26:09] <sammich> arschmitz: fixed all my problems except for that slider issue now. I did a code cleanup and removed a stack of useless trigger('create')s I left lying around
[05:26:30] <arschmitz> sammich: awesome
[05:26:53] <arschmitz> i actually just ran across the jsbin illustrating how to do what you wanted with the slider when looking for a different one
[05:27:00] <arschmitz> like 3 minutes ago
[05:27:15] <sammich> small (internet)world
[05:27:21] <nawi> arschmitz: hmm, the fiddle works but my app (built using phonegap) doesn't
[05:28:32] <sammich> you know, what would be really nice arschmitz, if you combined a MVC/knockout/data-bound widget model to jQM ;)
[05:29:11] <Bauer1> guys, I have this page: http://devstore.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=VirtualMachines_Filter_Test where I deal with show/hide operations to divs (mostly $('table.PlanLine').hide('slow'); ) - problem is, that once I run this stuff, the Width of the table cells is shortened, and I cant figure out why :S
[05:29:13] <arschmitz> nawi: if you can reproduce in a simple test case out side your app ( even if still in phonegap ) please submit an issue at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[05:30:44] <arschmitz> sammich: yeah client side mvc is something we probably will never do. relying one client side processing on potentially slow underpowered mobile devices can not always work out so well
[05:31:01] <sammich> Bauer1: when you hide/display:none, elements don't (forget the correct term here) take up any space on the DOM. If you want to keep things as you see them, set visibility:hidden
[05:31:27] <sammich> oh well, worth asking ;)
[05:31:35] <Bauer1> sammich: do you mean my .hide is using display:none?
[05:31:40] <sammich> yup
[05:31:45] <arschmitz> maybe if some day the average mobile device gets a lot faster then it is now
[05:31:48] <sammich> .hide() sets display:none
[05:32:49] <Bauer1> sammich: I am not sure you understood correctly: I DONT want empty space when it is hidden. My problem is, that when I use .show, the width is not restored to the way it was initially in the table
[05:33:45] <Brutick> Bauer1: Try creating a css class called hidden
[05:34:02] <Brutick> Bauer1: I think I ran into this issue before hiding rows of a table.
[05:34:24] <Brutick> Bauer1: Instead of .hide() and .show() do .addClass() and .removeClass()
[05:34:38] <Brutick> Bauer1: oh and .hasClass() to check
[05:35:13] <sammich> is it because when you run the animations, it uses explicit width/height values, and they're still set when the ani finishes
[05:35:55] <arschmitz> Brutick: rather then using addclass and removeclass and hasclass its much easier to use toggle class
[05:36:30] <Brutick> arschmitz: Good point! Thanks for pointing that out to me. Always forget about .toggleClass()
[05:36:38] <sammich> me too :(
[05:36:53] <arschmitz> its a handy one
[05:37:08] <Cork> and don't forget about the second argument to toggleClass it makes it damn powerful
[05:37:19] <arschmitz> yup can use a functoion
[05:37:26] <arschmitz> function which is awesome
[05:37:44] <Cork> ya, though i meant the true/false parameter
[05:37:59] <arschmitz> yes thats what i was talking about
[05:38:02] <Cork> toggleClass('something', true)
[05:38:10] <arschmitz> you can use a function that returns true or false
[05:38:14] <sammich> it's like back in the day I would read a checkbox, calculate the opposite (with an if!) and set it back
[05:38:23] <sammich> now I just .click() it ;)
[05:39:03] <Cork> sammich: calculate the opposite?
[05:39:24] <sammich> if (boolVar == false) boolVar = true
[05:39:45] <sammich> then again, at least now I do boolVar = !boolVar
[05:39:52] <Cork> why not just elm.checked == !elm.checked ?
[05:40:16] <Cork> though you should not have to do that anyway, the browser normally handles that fine
[05:40:33] <sammich> this was way back when I was a little green on JS
[05:40:42] <sammich> (like 8 months ago ;))
[05:40:47] <Cork> lol
[05:41:13] <sammich> gotta start somewhere
[05:41:29] <Cork> back in 97 i coded a website, where you didn't need any server connection after the initial page load...
[05:41:53] <Cork> looking back at it i think i must have been crazy :)
[05:41:54] <Bauer1> Brutick: which class do you suggest I set/unset for it to work?
[05:42:02] <sammich> btw, if were iterating over an object's keys, do you need the hasOwnProperty(key) if it's a plain obkect you created?
[05:42:16] <Bauer1> arschmitz: I just tried the .toggle - the problem persists  (you can see on current version doing ctrl-r)
[05:42:23] <Cork> sammich: yes, if you don't use $.each
[05:43:27] <sammich> okay. I'm at the stage where I'm trying to use less jQuery ;)
[05:43:27] <Bauer1> sammich: how do I test your theory, that it is because the animation uses explicit width/height? and/or how do I set different animation width/height?
[05:44:08] <Cork> ?eval Object.prototype.wrong = 10; var a = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}; for(k in a) { print(k) } @ sammich
[05:44:11] <bot-t> sammich: "a""b""c""wrong"
[05:44:13] <sammich> Bauer1: I had a look and tbh I give up when it comes to nested tables ;) I tried to remove the inline styles but it didn't quite fix it
[05:44:23] <sammich> what you could do is set table-layout:fixed
[05:44:52] <sammich> ah, so that's what that means
[05:44:58] <sammich> thanks Cork
[05:45:11] <Cork> and that is why you should never use for in on arrays :)
[05:45:38] <Cork> i've had to hack way to many libs cause they expect Object.prototype and Array.prototype to be empty...
[05:45:39] <sammich> never considered it...before now
[05:46:02] <Brutick> for in's are silly. I dislike it because it doesn't even use an object within the array, you're better off handling it manually
[05:47:56] <Cork> ?eval Object.prototype.wrong = 10; var a = ['a', 'b', 'c']; for(k in a) { print(a[k]) } @ sammich
[05:47:57] <bot-t> sammich: "a""b""c"10
[05:48:06] <Cork> sammich: kinda a good way to mess with someones head :)
[05:48:25] <sammich> totally get that
[05:49:39] <Bauer1> sammich: table-layout:fixed; is not helping :( Cork, maybe you have some ideas?
[05:49:41] <sammich> got a 3 level object struct, so I have to nest two of those things
[05:49:53] <sammich> nest one*
[05:50:05] <Cork> Bauer1: to do what?
[05:50:18] <Cork> haven't followed the question
[05:51:39] <Bauer1> Cork: the problem I am dealing with is that $('table.PlanLine').hide('slow'); and .show ruin the Width of the table's cell - they no longer take up the full width of the parent table after runnign animation.
[05:51:55] <Bauer1> Cork: on the page http://devstore.ccccloud.com/index.php?NAME_PATH=VirtualMachines_Filter_Test after you choose some filtering
[05:52:59] <sammich> Bauer1: .PlanLine tr td:first-child { width:60%; }
[05:53:11] <sammich> .PlanLine { table-layout:fixed; }
[05:54:09] <sammich> at least that seems to work in Chrome
[05:54:54] <Cork> Bauer1: you really shouldn't use tables for layout
[05:55:10] <Cork> it hasn't been needed for the last 10+ years
[05:55:14] <sammich> flex is where it's at
[05:55:27] <Cork> you can solve things without flex too
[05:55:51] <Cork> css can make things behave like a column without all the extra overhead of tables
[05:56:29] <drag0nius> how would i listen for checked state of radio button?
[05:56:40] <Cork> you can't
[05:56:46] <Brutick> Aside: What is considered the best thing for layout nowadays? (Insert "back in my day"/"get off my lawn" statements)
[05:56:51] <Cork> you would have to listen for user interaction and then check the state
[05:57:06] <drag0nius> what would be the most reliable interaction listener?
[05:57:09] <sammich> get off my dead lawn
[05:57:16] <sammich> change
[05:57:20] <Cork> Brutick: semantic markup and then styling from css
[05:57:51] <Cork> a table should be for listing tables of data; not layout
[05:58:26] <Bauer1> sammich: it works!! but can you explain why it works?
[05:58:32] <Bauer1> and how you found the solution
[06:00:45] <j3lte> Finally, I'm back :p
[06:01:24] <sammich> table-layout:fixed doesn't use the content to find it's size
[06:01:28] <Bauer1> Cork: well, I have no idea how to do layouts without tables..
[06:01:30] <sammich> just the defined width settings
[06:02:02] <sammich> so it doesn't work properly unless you start to define widths to at least one column
[06:03:48] <Cork> Bauer1: <div class="group"><div class="column"></div> .group { display: table; } .colunn { display: table-cell; }
[06:04:14] <Cork> Bauer1: that should give you a semantically correct markup, but still with the flexible sections
[06:04:34] <Cork> (sure you can use section or article too instead of div if they match better)
[06:04:53] <sammich> should learn some of those new HTML5 tags
[06:05:03] <sammich> I only found out the other day <tfoot> existed
[06:05:37] <Cork> tfoot isn't anything new
[06:05:52] <sammich> I know, just shows how far behind I am ;)
[06:05:55] <Cork> it's been around sens mid 90's
[06:06:16] <sammich> more of a lack of needing to use it that I haven't discovered it
[06:06:16] <Cork> sammich: side note, html5 is a buzzword not a standard
[06:06:36] <Cork> the standard is "html" or "html living standard"
[06:06:39] <sammich> I'll wait until 2019 before I use that then
[06:07:44] <Bauer1> thanks Cork, sammich :) will practice on styling using divs.. interesting method
[06:07:52] <sammich> oops, 2016
[06:08:39] <sammich> it seems like I'm an enabler on this channel
[06:08:54] <Cork> "enabler"?
[06:09:26] <sammich> suggesting fixes for old method instead of encouraging new better ways?
[06:10:02] <Cork> sammich: well it is normally better to try to figure out what a question is about before answering it
[06:10:18] <Cork> not always possible though...
[06:12:24] <sammich> anywho, later all
[06:17:13] <Bauer1> sammich: still here mate?  I applied your suggestion adding the width attribute to the first TD of each row, but still after animation, it breaks width...
[06:20:36] <roelmonnens> does anybody know how long it takes voor Google to update their CDN with the new 2.0.3 version?

[06:27:58] <ldexterldesign> anyone help? > https://gist.github.com/ldexterldesign/5948767 - i wanna replace each li > a with the text content from each h1
[06:28:15] <ldexterldesign> my script ain't working                                                                     get
[06:29:25] <ldexterldesign> my script ain't working - appears to be throwing out the last item in the 'string'?
[06:29:33] <Cork> $('.wid-a-nav a').each(function() { var self = $(this); self.html($(self.attr('prop')).text()); });
[06:29:49] <ldexterldesign> Cork:thanks - will give that a try
[06:29:56] <Cork> ldexterldesign: sorry thats wrong
[06:30:09] <Cork> $('.wid-a-nav a').each(function() { var self = $(this); self.html($(self.attr('href')).text()); });
[06:30:12] <Cork> that should be correct
[06:32:48] <burdpewpewp> hi, is there any way i can hide a div but keep the elements within visible?
[06:33:18] <Cork> no
[06:33:27] <reloadz> hi my jQuery lob\ving friends... can anyone tell me why i dont get in return 0,21? http://jsfiddle.net/jwHUA/
[06:33:46] <reloadz> jQuery loveing friends*
[06:33:50] <burdpewpewp> ok tnx
[06:34:16] <Cork> reloadz: cause floats isn't precise
[06:34:28] <reloadz> can update?
[06:34:30] <Cork> reloadz: use toFixed(2)
[06:34:44] <Cork> ?eval 1.21-1
[06:34:44] <bot-t> Cork: 0.20999999999999996
[06:34:53] <Cork> ?eval (1.21-1).toFixed(2)
[06:34:53] <bot-t> Cork: "0.21"
[06:35:09] <Cork> round is another option
[06:35:24] <reloadz> naa - this is perfect :)
[06:35:25] <reloadz> thx
[06:35:44] <Cork> ?eval Math.round((1.21-1) * 100) / 100
[06:35:44] <bot-t> Cork: 0.21
[06:41:40] <c4ptnh00k> morning gents
[06:45:08] <ldexterldesign> Cork:https://gist.github.com/ldexterldesign/5948767#comment-858726 solved it - thanks for the attempt
[06:45:42] <Cork> ldexterldesign: why are you running it backwards when you can do it simpler from the other direction?
[06:56:16] <drager> So I have made a ajax post call for users to like posts in a forum like this; http://jsfiddle.net/veRRX/ It works just fine but now I want the (AMOUNT OF LIKES) value to be updated when they like the post. Ideas?
[06:56:50] <Cork> drager: so send the number back from the ajax call
[06:57:03] <Cork> and then update the value when success fires
[06:59:26] <drager> Cork: Hmm, I'm not really sure how I should do that.
[06:59:40] <Cork> drager: you already have the success callback
[06:59:43] <fn> Cork: thanks for your help
[06:59:49] <fn> i was so stupid
[06:59:56] <fn> but it works now
[07:00:09] <Cork> drager: all you have to do is send the value back from the server and update the element where you want the value to show
[07:00:44] <drager> Cork: So in my server-side code I need to pass the NEW value back to ajax?
[07:00:54] <Cork> yes
[07:00:58] <drager> Alright, thanks
[07:01:09] <Cork> else the page wouldn't know what to update to
[07:01:59] <drager> Aye
[07:05:36] <bytephilia> How can I freeze jQuery slider in one direction?
[07:05:43] <bytephilia> I.e. disable sliding to the right
[07:06:13] <Cork> bytephilia: bind the slide event and prevent it from going past the value you don't want it to go
[07:08:00] <bytephilia> Cork, to let you in on my case scenario, I have a global variable integer X. I have 5 sliders. Once X reaches 100 no slider should be allowed to go to the right (increase) until X has gone below 100.
[07:08:24] <bytephilia> I guess I could do what you said with each slider though
[07:08:34] <Cork> if(x >= 100) { return false; }
[07:15:44] <bytephilia> Cork: how would it be best to detect slider right direction movement? Check if the current value is higher than previous value on slider change?
[07:18:13] <drager> Cork: Okey, so now I send back the value. But the value comes at error and not success...
[07:18:30] <Cork> bytephilia: http://jsfiddle.net/zr2Pv/
[07:18:49] <Cork> drager: could you send the link again
[07:18:57] <drager> Cork: Let me update,.
[07:19:34] <drager> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/veRRX/1/
[07:19:51] <Cork> drager: how are you sending the value back?
[07:20:02] <drager> and my response is now, {"likes": 1}
[07:21:01] <bytephilia> Cork: I have to stop it in an unknown place between min and max. I'm going to try something
[07:21:29] <shamess> With jquery Mobile. I'm pulling in a form with ajax which I now need jQuery to enhance. Most places are telling to me trigger the 'create' event, but that doesn't seem to be working for me
[07:21:32] <Cork> bytephilia: if you take the new value minus the old one you should know the direction
[07:21:59] <Cork> drager: <?php header('content-type: application/json'); echo json_encode(Array('likes' => 1)); %>
[07:22:02] <Cork> try that
[07:22:09] <shamess> And most the answers I've found are quite old. how do I tell jquery to enhance a form?
[07:22:15] <alexksso> hey guys
[07:22:40] <drager> Cork: I'm not using PHP though, but let me translate it ;)
[07:22:41] <alexksso> any wiz that can help me on this: what am I doing wrong  ? : https://www.diveboard.com/explore ? http://www.diveboard.com/explore works but not the https ...
[07:22:44] <alexksso> I tweaked a lot adding the proper headers for Access-Control-Allow-Origin:www1.diveboard.com www2.diveboard.com www3.diveboard.com
[07:22:50] <alexksso> and yet it fails :/
[07:24:16] <Cork> alexksso: for one your loading http content in your https session
[07:24:35] <alexksso> nope
[07:24:37] <alexksso> it's https
[07:24:54] <alexksso> (there is http content but it's not causing trouble)
[07:25:05] <alexksso> (so let's focus on the real issue ;) )
[07:25:06] <Cork> [16:24:50.186] Blocked loading mixed active content "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/likebox.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdiveboard&width=200&colorscheme=dark&show_faces=false&stream=false&header=false&height=140" @ https://www.diveboard.com/explore
[07:25:14] <Cork> yes you are :)
[07:25:38] <drager> Cork: Okey, so now I'm sending a list and I get it on success instead
[07:25:53] <alexksso> still it's not the issue
[07:26:06] <Cork> alexksso: not THE issue, but an issue
[07:26:22] <alexksso> there are always issues
[07:26:30] <Cork> and your server is responding with "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.diveboard.com
[07:26:32] <alexksso> the one i'm talking about is blocking content to load
[07:26:41] <alexksso> so should be https ?
[07:26:58] <Cork> if you are doing https to the server the https protocol needs to be allowed
[07:27:21] <Cork> alexksso: have a look at your error console/network tab next time
[07:27:26] <Cork> it is stated right in there
[07:27:55] <alexksso> the content comes from a cdn
[07:27:59] <alexksso> and is retrieved in https
[07:28:04] <alexksso> as u can see in the console
[07:28:18] <Cork> yes, and the server says you may only access it through http
[07:28:24] <alexksso> I suspect that the json comes with a wrong header
[07:28:28] <Cork> so the browser blocks the .json calls
[07:28:28] <alexksso> ah
[07:28:34] <Cork> like i said
[07:28:40] <alexksso> interesting
[07:28:51] <alexksso> so I need to force always https I guess
[07:29:35] <utroda> Any ideas why the following code prevents links within sidebar__navigation from being clickable, on touch devices. http://paste.laravel.com/Aa2
[07:29:38] <alexksso> but then it may break the http version :/
[07:30:42] <Cork> alexksso: so set the protocol based on what protocol is used for the request
[07:30:52] <alexksso> i use maxcdn
[07:31:02] <alexksso> not sure how to change the header
[07:31:11] <alexksso> it's currently set on http://
[07:31:52] <drager> Cork: And now, how should I insert the data?
[07:32:06] <Cork> drager: depends on where you want it
[07:32:25] <drager> Cork: On the button, the value=""
[07:32:33] <drager> or as you can see, AMOUNT...
[07:32:44] <Cork> .val(new_value) then
[07:33:36] <Cork> so ex. in the click handler do var button = $(this); and then in the callback do button.val('text: ' + response.likes);
[07:34:14] <Cork> personally i would prob use a <button> instead and just have a span in it for the number
[07:34:53] <drager> Cork: I have a button for it?
[07:35:00] <drager> or do you mean a span for the number?
[07:35:59] <Cork> instead of having <input type="submit" id="like" value="sdkfjhsdjkfh"> do <button id="like">sdjkfhsdkf<span class="number"></span></button
[07:36:01] <Cork> >
[07:36:16] <Cork> then you don't have to care about what is in the button to update the number
[07:36:51] <drager> Alright, will do so. Thanks
[07:41:49] <evilgeenius> Hello All
[07:41:59] <evilgeenius> Can someone solve this easy problem : http://pastie.org/8121369
[07:43:00] <evilgeenius> I have a simple bit of javascript : '$('#m_'+index+' input[type="checkbox"]').attr("checked", state);'    But it will ONLY check all the boxes the first time it is run.  Any idea what is wrong?
[07:43:31] <Cork> evilgeenius: firstly move your js out of the html
[07:43:43] <Cork> and please make a working example in jsfiddle.net
[07:43:55] <Cork> (with both html and js for the demo)
[07:44:04] <evilgeenius> ok
[07:58:15] <alexksso> Cork: fixed :) thanks - I realized a few things with our discussion :)
[07:59:30] <Shilon> hello, I'm using super sized script but trying to make the captions fade in and out, anyone knows how to do it?
[08:02:32] <alexksso> (for the record it ended up as a heavy ngix config headache)
[08:05:42] <jop008> I have a jqmobile site and have a table with on the rows form fields the layout is like this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-07-08_at_5.03.18_PM-BlatB7NU.png
[08:06:06] <jop008> can it be better? with all form elements the same size for example
[08:08:21] <jop008> no jqm gurus here?
[08:17:18] <jop008> how can I change style display:block?
[08:18:02] <Gho5t> .css('display', 'block')
[08:20:50] <jop008> .show ()
[08:21:05] <jop008> is it wise to build a table with a html string
[08:21:29] <jop008> my performance is a bit slow having 110 rows
[08:21:59] <Gho5t> depends on how you're doing it
[08:22:12] <jop008> html += etc
[08:22:20] <Gho5t> if you're adding rows in a loop to an attached dom element then no
[08:22:32] <Gho5t> it's best to do it on a detached element then append to the dom when finished
[08:22:37] <jop008> and at the end      $.each(result, function(i, field){
[08:22:37] <jop008>           chtml += addoptionrow (field, (i==nlen-1));
[08:22:39] <jop008>           if (i == (nlen-1)) {
[08:22:40] <jop008>             $("#option_detail_rows").append (chtml);
[08:22:40] <jop008>             $("#option_detail_rows").trigger("create");
[08:22:49] <jop008> so there is one append
[08:23:10] <Gho5t> better to add it to the live dom only once
[08:23:13] <jop008> a detached element ?
[08:23:42] <jop008> I have it only once the last record is if (i==(nen-1)
[08:23:58] <Gho5t> var $newRows = ''; $.each( // add to $newRows); then append $newRows to the table
[08:24:24] <jop008> and how is $newRows defined ?
[08:24:30] <Gho5t> also you should cach $('#option_detail_rows')
[08:24:30] <jop008> at initi
[08:24:33] <BillCriswell> jop008: Instead of doing like each { table.append(row); } do allRows = ''; each { +=allRows }; table.append( allRows )
[08:24:37] <Gho5t> instead of wrapping it twice
[08:25:54] <jop008> wrapping it twice?
[08:26:17] <Gho5t> in jquery
[08:26:20] <Gho5t> use chaining
[08:26:37] <BillCriswell> jop008: $option_detail_rows = $('#option_detail_rows'); then work with $option_detail_rows instead of $('#option_detail_rows')
[08:27:36] <BillCriswell> It doesn't seem like it needs to be in the each either? Also, more important, append to the table all at once instead of on each row.
[08:27:44] <jop008> Oke I understand
[08:33:04] <jop008> no performance gain doing it like this
[08:33:53] <jop008> I have    var option_detail_rows = $("#option_detail_rows"); and then .append (bightml string)
[08:34:07] <jop008> which is slow
[08:34:29] <wesleyh> Quick question: If I have a <script>..</script> section in <head>, can we then assume that head is accessible already by jquery? No need to wait for document.ready?
[08:35:32] <Gho5t> right but you should have your scripts at the bottom of the page if you can
[08:36:10] <wesleyh> can't, working with a cms that puts everything in the head - i need to add a stylesheet, but don't want to wait for document ready
[08:36:23] <wesleyh> so it should be safe to just append it to the head without doc ready?
[08:36:37] <wesleyh> when the script trying to do that is in the head
[08:36:37] <jedimind> wesleyh theoretically, yes
[08:36:45] <wesleyh> ok, thanks
[08:37:23] <BillCriswell> jop008: Hmm, What does addoptionrow() loook like?
[08:37:30] <wolfehr> is there a less permanent way of preventing an event handler bound with on() from triggering thatn off()?
[08:37:46] <jop008> I do a patebin wait
[08:38:04] <wolfehr> ah, I guess I can just add an extra class to the bound element so it knows when not to execute code….
[08:38:10] <wolfehr> ignore me
[08:38:35] <jop008> here it is http://pastebin.com/jNNRn3ku
[08:39:12] <jop008> building the table not in the layout I want it but that is later
[08:39:21] <mayhew> jop008: += is very slow, that's probably your issue
[08:40:00] <jop008> and how to improve?
[08:40:06] <Gho5t> I don't like the way you're doing that
[08:40:19] <Gho5t> I would create the element using append or something
[08:40:24] <Gho5t> and then add it to the dom
[08:40:30] <Gho5t> not build up some big string
[08:41:03] <jop008> so how to create an element and use append with it?
[08:41:12] <mentoc> If I have f={1: "one", 2: "two" } how would I access 2?
[08:41:18] <mentoc> f.2?
[08:41:23] <Gho5t> f['2']
[08:41:25] <jop008> so append is faster than html+=
[08:41:29] <mayhew> jop008: is there a reason you're building this big HTML string on the client?
[08:41:57] <jop008> not really my coomuncation is always using json
[08:42:07] <jop008> so no web code in php
[08:42:15] <iamjarvo> is there something similar to getScript with a time out option
[08:42:16] <jop008> a nice design
[08:42:23] <mayhew> jop008: so you don't render any HTML on the server at all?
[08:42:31] <jop008> no not any
[08:42:41] <jop008> always use ajax
[08:42:52] <jop008> getjson and xmlhttp
[08:43:20] <mayhew> jop008: you can still render this on the server and fetch it with ajax
[08:43:44] <jop008> wrapping it in json you mean
[08:43:48] <jop008> as one string
[08:44:21] <mayhew> jop008: no, just returning the rendered HTML as text/html, and using something like $.load to insert it into the DOM
[08:44:40] <platzhirsch> Is there something like an event, which is triggered if I am starting to reach the end of a scrollable select?
[08:44:45] <jop008> $.load is new to me
[08:45:01] <jop008> and use append instead of html+=
[08:45:04] <jop008> faster?
[08:46:58] <mayhew> jop008: they do different things, but you should never build a large string using concatenation
[08:47:39] <jop008> so I try to switch to .append
[08:48:07] <jop008> and if I avoid += and using + instead
[08:49:59] <jop008> so replace += by + is faster?
[08:50:55] <mayhew> jop008: no, you're doing it wrong and building huge strings like that is an unmaintainable mess. Render your HTML on the server or use a template language.
[08:52:13] <DarkSector_> Hi, I am failing miserably at this simple script http://jsfiddle.net/Uc2sz/2/ I want to have an alert pop up when the radio field is changed. How can I do that?
[08:52:26] <jop008> so limitation of javascript
[08:54:30] <shoky> DarkSector_: you need to handle the 'change' event for the radios. either with .change(..) or with .on('change', ..)
[08:54:38] <DarkSector_> Oh okay
[08:54:48] <Gho5t> jop008: why do you think that's a limitation of javascript
[08:55:03] <jop008> since performance is too slow
[08:55:10] <Gho5t> strings are immutable
[08:55:14] <Gho5t> just like they are in C# and Java
[08:55:33] <Gho5t> you're creating a new item on the heap each time you do that
[08:55:34] <jop008> so in all langueages += slow?
[08:56:16] <Gho5t> definitely not performant if you understand what's going on under the hood
[08:56:35] <Gho5t> that's why there's methods like .append or StringBuilders
[08:56:35] <DarkSector_> shoky: How, do I specify the identifier, I mean isn't it usually caught by id or class? How can I have it by name instead?
[08:57:09] <mayhew> DarkSector_: you could use 'input[type=radio]' if you wanted to listen to every one on the page
[08:57:38] <DarkSector_> Okay time to try it
[08:58:04] <shoky> DarkSector_: the same way you did before..
[08:58:12] <shoky> DarkSector_: http://jsfiddle.net/Uc2sz/5/
[08:58:55] <DarkSector_> shoky: Oh! Wow, thanks :)
[09:03:17] <jop008> what is difference between .html and .append
[09:03:26] <jop008> on an element
[09:05:09] <shoky> .html replaces the whole contents
[09:07:22] <jop008> http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-fast-string-concatenation/
[09:08:36] <`potkettle> does anyone know why jquery autocomplete focus would write to a parent div instead of the input box  when i call event.previewdefault
[09:08:41] <`potkettle> sorry thats event.preventdefault
[09:08:57] <`potkettle> it doesn't seems o happen for select or change, but only for focus
[09:12:55] <dc50> hi
[09:13:26] <dc50> Can anyone tell me why this validation does not work at all?    http://bin.cakephp.org/saved/104435
[09:13:28] <shoky> `demo @ `potkettle
[09:13:28] <b-ot> `potkettle: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:13:55] <`potkettle> shaky okies
[09:14:05] <shoky> dc50:  jquery doesn't have .getAttribute   use .att
[09:14:10] <shoky> .attr
[09:14:10] <b-ot> shoky: used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[09:15:10] <dc50> shoky: k im going to try it now.
[09:15:20] <dc50> sry im a php guy
[09:16:02] <shoky> you're forgiven
[09:16:20] <shoky> and check your console for errors to find stuff like that
[09:16:26] <`potkettle> oh wow fiddle needs a lot of fiddling ill have to try another time
[09:16:52] <shoky> `potkettle: for jquery-ui you need like 3 clicks to set it up..
[09:17:32] <`potkettle> yes i suppose the whole page isn't required ill just go for the autcomplete snippet
[09:17:38] <spobat> is there a better way of doing this?
[09:17:41] <spobat> obj
[09:17:41] <spobat>         .removeClass('btn-warning')
[09:17:41] <spobat>         .removeClass('btn-danger')
[09:17:43] <spobat>         .removeClass('btn-primary')
[09:17:45] <spobat>         .removeClass('btn-info')
[09:17:47] <spobat>         .removeClass('btn-success');
[09:17:49] <spobat> upps :o
[09:17:50] <shoky> `potkettle: a minimal demo that shows your problem is all that's needed
[09:18:41] <shoky> spobat: you can remove multiple classes in one call  .removeClass('a b c d e')
[09:19:41] <spobat> ok
[09:20:27] <spobat> thank you
[09:21:59] <jop008> I tried  buf.push ( "</div></td>"); but also slow
[09:23:41] <Tomashe> anyone can help me to animate wookmark elements ?
[09:25:54] <dc50> shoky: now it works kind of. but it does not add up the values of the row into rowTotal... new bin      http://bin.cakephp.org/saved/104437
[09:26:06] <`potkettle> ok first fiddle done
[09:26:07] <`potkettle> http://jsfiddle.net/hNa49/
[09:26:12] <`potkettle> it seems to work in there though
[09:26:34] <shoky> dc50:  rowTotal + $(this).val();
[09:26:42] <shoky> dc50: that line doesn't do anything
[09:27:14] <dc50> what is the proper way to add them and keep the value for the next iteration?
[09:27:19] <shoky> dc50: also beware,  the value is a string, not a number
[09:27:39] <dc50> shoky:what is the proper way to add them and keep the value for the next iteration?
[09:27:54] <shoky> dc50:   A + B  doesn't do anything.  you want  A = A + B    or   A += B
[09:28:44] <jop008> what is a good way to wrap a long html string in a json object?
[09:28:45] <dc50> is there a way to scope a var in the function so that when the iteration completes the value is kept instead of lost?
[09:29:29] <shoky> dc50: the value isn't lost after the iteration..
[09:29:49] <shoky> dc50: you just haven't been changing the value
[09:30:04] <dc50> shoky: yeah I just saw that... Feeling like an idiot today
[09:30:10] <jop008> using PHP server side
[09:30:40] <shoky> jop008: same way as a short html string, or any string
[09:31:33] <jop008> I think this will do {"html": "<p>I'm the markup</p>"}
[09:31:44] <jop008> my string wiill be a large string
[09:31:51] <shoky> json doesn't care
[09:32:27] <jop008> So php string handling at server is faster than javascript?
[09:32:47] <shoky> wat
[09:33:31] <shoky> javascript is clientside. can't really compare the two
[09:34:02] <jop008> and client is always slower?
[09:34:47] <shoky> what did i just say?
[09:38:56] <igcewieling1> I'm submitting a form with a input type="file".  It works when using a normal submit without ajax, but when I try send the form data using ajax the form is sent, but the file is not uploaded.   Do I need to do something different to handle ajax form file uploads or am I just doing something wrong?
[09:40:36] <NoiseEee> igcewieling1: traditional ajax/xhr does not support file uploading
[09:40:40] <NoiseEee> igcewieling1: look into xhr2
[09:41:35] <igcewieling1> NoiseEee: that is disappointing.   xhr2 is an HTML5 only thing, isn't it?   Do all browsers likely to be in use support that?
[09:42:01] <NoiseEee> http://caniuse.com/#search=xhr2 @ igcewieling1
[09:42:15] <NoiseEee> other alternative is to use a hidden iframe to really post the form.
[09:43:23] <traets> if i append something to the body via $('body').html('<div id="foo"></div>"), how do i use this div later? $('#foo').lenfth gives 0
[09:43:26] <rmill> .caniuse xhr2
[09:43:26] <b-ot> rmill: You can use XMLHttpRequest 2 with: Internet Explorer 10, Firefox 4, Chrome 7, Safari 5, Opera 12, iOS Safari 5.0-5.1, and Opera Mobile 12. http://caniuse.com/#search=xhr2
[09:43:34] <rmill> OH SHI-
[09:43:59] <rmill> traets: It shouldn't.
[09:44:13] <igcewieling1> heh, the referenced page says IE8 supports xhr2
[09:44:23] <p3lim> I'm using this https://gist.github.com/p3lim/5950294, and I get a PHP error: "Notice: Undefined index: data in test.php on line 3"
[09:44:49] <rmill> igcewieling1 red indicates partial support.
[09:44:51] <p3lim> I tried asking in ##php, but they couldn't figure it out, and redirected me to ask here
[09:44:57] <rmill> oh
[09:45:01] <rmill> not supported, actually.
[09:45:13] <rmill> There's a tinted green for partial.
[09:45:27] <igcewieling1> iframe it is then!
[09:45:33] <traets> but it does
[09:45:43] <rmill> DOES IT, THO?

[09:46:30] <mayhew> p3lim: use an object (data: {'key': 'value'}) - then in PHP you can access it via $_POST['key']
[09:47:06] <p3lim> mayhew: I'll try that, thanks
[09:47:30] <p3lim> But is there a way that I can keep the js side just like that, but rather modify the php end to read it diffrently?
[09:47:44] <traets> p3lim: in the php file you have to return something
[09:47:54] <traets> the js says its expecting a json back
[09:48:13] <p3lim> traets: I know, but I can't return anything anyways when it errors on the first line
[09:48:20] <p3lim> Which is what I'm trying to fix
[09:49:29] <traets> not gettingp3in the js, try data : {'foo' :
[09:49:33] <traets> damn enter key
[09:50:07] <traets> try sending a json in the data attribute
[09:52:13] <p3lim> mayhew: Still getting the same error
[09:52:50] <p3lim> According to the network tab in chrome's dev console it's sending ok, I just get that error in the php file
[09:54:11] <NoiseEee> p3lim: but is it sending the data you are expecting?
[09:54:54] <NoiseEee> p3lim: "Network" / click XHR on the bottom, then view the request.  did it send what you expected?
[09:54:56] <p3lim> According to the logs, the Request Payload is this: "data=Hello"
[09:55:39] <p3lim> method is POST, status code is 200 OK
[09:55:44] <p3lim> So everything is sending fine
[09:55:48] <NoiseEee> p3lim: it sounds like you're not quite making the object correctly
[09:57:35] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/USyft/12/ (my "photos only" switch) -- what's the best way of copying each title's href over to its newly cloned image?
[09:57:38] <boytoy> Trying this each function here: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/USyft/13/ -- but it seems to be cloning a lot more than it's suppose to!
[09:57:57] <NoiseEee> p3lim: you should see your key/values under "Form Data" in the Headers part of your request via above
[09:58:16] <NoiseEee> p3lim: Form Data------   data: hello
[09:58:16] <p3lim> Yeah, now I got it
[09:58:19] <p3lim> weird
[10:10:55] <guest______> Is this the place to get help with jquery mobile?
[10:11:08] <jedimind> guest______ it could be
[10:12:03] <guest______> ok my list view does not seem to be working properly(this is my first time using jquery mobile)
[10:13:53] <guest______> I made my own theme in the theme roller and used that instead of the default one and now it does not show the listview just a bulleted list
[10:23:16] <jita> Is it possible to make input truly readonly? such that it could not be altered in console ?
[10:26:54] <snover> jita: no.
[10:27:46] <wesleyh> I have a tab that is triggered when hovered over. Hovering slides out a content section. Then clicking the tab slides it back in. The problem is that when I am clicked it to close, apparently jquery (or the browser) thinks i'm still positioned over the tab (even though it's now shown in the corner of the browser (remember slide in)), so when i move my mouse 1 inch, the hover event is triggered again. Is there anything I can do about this?
[10:28:02] <yedi> what's going on here? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/100290676/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-08%20at%201.24.54%20PM.png
[10:28:25] <wesleyh> interestingly, when the slide in is triggered (so when i click the tab) the mouse still shows the hand pointer even though it's not hovering over the tab any more
[10:31:54] <p3lim> Issue: In this example, error is fired, not success: https://gist.github.com/p3lim/5950770
[10:31:59] <p3lim> And I have no clue why
[10:32:33] <p3lim> The data and everything is correct
[10:35:15] <shoky> p3lim: what's the error? what do you see in your devtools network tab?
[10:36:34] <shoky> yedi: the first one has two slashes in the result string,  the second one has only one
[10:40:00] <p3lim> shoky: In the response I get this: string(5) "Hello" {"key":"abc123"}
[10:40:04] <p3lim> Which is correct
[10:40:15] <p3lim> Thing is, I get no errors
[10:40:21] <p3lim> But it fires the error callback in ajax
[10:41:18] <p3lim> The response in the error callback has status 200 even
[10:41:19] <EatAtJoes> Does .get() automatically know if you are tyring to make a cross domain ajax call, and then run the  appropriate code, and do the cross domain request for you?
[10:43:01] <shoky> p3lim: i don't udnerstand that response.. that's what you see in the network tab?
[10:43:18] <shoky> p3lim: why is there "Hello" there?
[10:43:28] <p3lim> It's the post.. nevermind
[10:43:39] <p3lim> What do you want to know from the network tab?
[10:43:46] <shoky> the actual response
[10:43:52] <shoky> server response
[10:44:42] <shoky> and also: the arguments passed in to the error callback
[10:45:07] <nVee> hey guys, sorry I know this is more js but hopefully someone can help. If I have an object of objects, how do I iterate through them, or better, how do I return say the 3rd object within the main object? something like testimonials.3.name (to return the name property from the 3rd object)
[10:45:58] <p3lim> shoky: The response is {"key":"abc123"}
[10:46:01] <p3lim> In the network tab
[10:46:26] <shoky> p3lim: ok, and the arguments to the error callback?
[10:46:39] <p3lim> You want the whole thing?
[10:47:07] <shoky> p3lim: the 2nd and 3rd
[10:48:51] <shoky> nVee: object keys aren't in any specific order, you shouldn't count on it
[10:49:06] <p3lim> Weird, now I'm getting success
[10:49:16] <piklu> I need a nice UI developer for a project - He will get royalty income from our operations - if any one is interested please send me a message
[10:49:47] <p3lim> Didn't change anything, now it calls the success callback
[10:50:09] <shoky> oh well
[10:50:21] <p3lim> As long as it works I suppose :p
[11:02:47] <p3lim> Some adjustments and I'm done ^_^
[11:06:06] <ph88> hurray !
[11:10:27] <Puck6633> If there's a percentage width assigned to an element, is it possible to query that value with jQuery? .width() and .css('width') are both giving me the calculated pixel value.
[11:12:37] <Puck6633> Now that I think about it, I could probably just get it with el.width()/el.parent().width(), but there's probably a slight margin or error there. Is there a better way?
[11:13:57] <Joel> When using this selector $('th, td', tr).each(function (j) { what's the best way to get the last td?
[11:14:05] <Joel> j seems to be the index of which one I'm on, but no way to tell the max?
[11:14:11] <ph88> Puck6633: try attr('width')
[11:15:00] <Puck6633> Joel: You mean the total number or the last element? For the total number you can use $('th, td', tr).length
[11:15:29] <ph88> Joel: use other selectors to make that eaiser
[11:15:41] <Puck6633> ph88: undefined. There's no width attribute, it;s assigned from a stylesheet. :\
[11:16:21] <Puck6633> Joel: For the actual last element, use last(). i.e. $('th, td', tr).last();
[11:16:29] <ph88> Puck6633: are you sure it's assigned ? double check
[11:16:56] <ph88> Puck6633: the last element could be a th and he wants the last td
[11:17:06] <Puck6633> ph88: I'm using FIrefox's built-in javascript console and it's coming back undefined.
[11:18:01] <Puck6633> ph88: Ah, good point. Probably the best way is to assign the query to a separate variable and use .find(), right?
[11:18:34] <ph88> Puck6633: which point are you talking abbout now ?
[11:19:02] <Puck6633> That he was looking for the last td, not the last element. :)
[11:19:21] <Puck6633> As for my issue, this is what I get: [14:15:17.405] $('.satellite').attr('width'); [14:15:17.412] undefined
[11:19:44] <eobet> could anyone please check http://pastie.org/8121902 and tell me if grid_text_limiter ever executes before imagesLoaded the way its written?
[11:20:09] <ph88> Puck6633:  what does your firebug say about applied styles ?
[11:21:12] <Puck6633> ph88: As expected, the applied rules for width and height are 23.5%
[11:21:36] <Puck6633> el.width() also varies with the window size, and the element looks correct.
[11:23:31] <j_wolf1> I'm trying to create a very simple hover effect...I feel like this is stupid simple, I've done hundreds of times...but for some reason I can't get it to work. basically I have a table. (in actual tabular format) I have a hidden span in the first td of every row. when a person hovers over a row, I want to fadeIn the first span of the row they're hovering over. http://paste.laravel.com/Ab3
[11:23:57] <j_wolf1> the problem is that the span is not fading in
[11:24:04] <j_wolf1> but I'm not getting any console errors
[11:24:06] <ph88> Puck6633:  i belief it's not supported :(
[11:24:41] <Puck6633> A minimal JSFiddle of my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/pSBd4/
[11:25:36] <ph88> Puck6633:  that attr was a stupid idea ... doesnt make sense
[11:25:57] <ph88> j_wolf1: i don't think tr take up any space somehow
[11:26:20] <Puck6633> I just updated my fiddle with my best solution, but you can see that it's not exact because the calculated pixel value is rounded.
[11:26:29] <ph88> j_wolf1: can you make a jsfiddle ?
[11:26:49] <atlanta> Any good places to find jquery experts for hire
[11:26:49] <atlanta>  ?
[11:26:50] <Puck6633> Instead of 0.50 (50%) I get 0.5008605851979346.
[11:26:55] <j_wolf1> sure, brb
[11:27:14] <Puck6633> atlanta: Probably a freelancer site like freelancer.com or guru.com
[11:27:21] <snover> hahahahahaha
[11:27:24] <snover> yeah. “experts”
[11:28:10] <Puck6633> Hm. looks like that is the only available solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5230425/getting-percent-css-position-with-jquery
[11:28:20] <ryanneufeld> Puck6633: that's cause JS is not great at floating point math
[11:29:28] <ph88> Puck6633:  out.append(Math.round(el.width()*100/el.parent().width()));
[11:29:31] <snover> it’s perfect at 64-bit floating point math
[11:29:41] <snover> it’s not good at arbitrary precision math
[11:30:27] <snover> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Kahan.jpg this guy invented it. just look at that hair and those glasses.

[11:49:50] <j_wolf1> ph88: brilliant! thank you!
[11:49:54] <ph88> np
[11:50:09] <ph88> var span  is not needed
[11:50:44] <Ungy> ph88 why not fade in and out?
[11:51:17] <ph88> because i assume that he doesn't want his table to suddenly get bigger horizontally
[11:51:33] <ph88> so you want to images to already take up space in the layout
[11:51:53] <ph88> fadeIn and fadeOut  use display: none;   removing the images from the layout all together
[11:52:15] <Ungy> right I eant mouseover mouseout
[11:52:15] <maxmoore14> does anyone know if there is a Blob constructor or BlobBuilder for Safari 5?
[11:53:39] <ph88> Ungy: i don't know ... its how j_wolf wanted it
[11:53:40] <j_wolf1> ph88: I can see that...fadeTo is actually better than setting a specific width on the first td as well
[11:54:49] <Ungy> j_wolf1 that is the old visibility: hidden vs display:none
[11:55:08] <ph88> j_wolf1: Ungy  has a point ... that hover event keeps triggering constantly ...
[11:55:40] <j_wolf1> Ungy: html5bp actually has both
[11:56:14] <j_wolf1> ph88: yea I was going to tweak...but I just couldn't get the original functionality working...first day of quitting smoking and I over analyze everything
[11:56:55] <ph88> ye that thing you wrote up earlier looked rather complicated ^^
[11:57:51] <j_wolf1> yea...I was trying to think of getting the specific row...then the 1st td on the given row...it just led to my blood itching that much more
[11:58:38] <ph88> ye  parent() will just give you that TR instead of having to use css selectors and counters ...
[11:58:44] <OnceMe> Why is my jquery code not executing properly on mozilla 3.0.8 ?
[11:58:59] <ph88> OnceMe: check your javascript console
[11:59:46] <Ungy> ph88 in his original code he put the hover on the tr so this was the tr
[12:00:14] <shoky> OnceMe: http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[12:01:25] <OnceMe> shoky:what does this mean? I use ajax for sign up form, and when I submit form, its sending data, having loader activated, but never return a thing from external script
[12:01:31] <ph88> Ungy: oh ye he wanted to find the same tr again :P
[12:01:33] <OnceMe> so actually I don't even have a fallback
[12:01:41] <NoiseEee> OnceMe: why on earth is anyone using firefox 3.0.8?
[12:01:46] <OnceMe> I have fallback only if js is disabled, and this is not the case as jquery code is triggered
[12:01:52] <shoky> OnceMe: it means jquery doesn't really support such an old browser
[12:01:53] <OnceMe> NoiseEee:dont know
[12:01:58] <shoky> at least not officially
[12:01:58] <NoiseEee> OnceMe: there's no excuse.
[12:02:07] <OnceMe> I have it on ubuntu 10, live cd?
[12:02:20] <OnceMe> But thats not the issue if is not working, i just want proper fallback..
[12:02:31] <OnceMe> On facebook, everything works fine, I guess they use JS instead of jquery
[12:03:02] <Ungy> OnceMe did you try a timeout
[12:05:24] <OnceMe> Ungy:here http://jsfiddle.net/WPaSk/
[12:05:45] <OnceMe> Thats what I use.. If there is a way to re-write it better, so it works/submit on mozilla 3.* it would be awesome
[12:07:12] <Ungy> OnceMe maybe try a timeout
[12:07:22] <andrewSC> hey guys
[12:07:34] <OnceMe> Ungy:how, example?
[12:07:57] <NoiseEee> OnceMe: you are totally insane for doing anything for firefox 3.0.8
[12:08:00] <Ungy> timeout: 500,
[12:08:09] <Ungy> add that to ajax
[12:08:12] <andrewSC> I'm trying to append content to a div and I don't understand why I have to click on the element to make it update to the new content?
[12:08:14] <andrewSC> https://gist.github.com/andrewSC/3f57224c85217c6a4632
[12:08:15] <Ungy> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:08:16] <andrewSC> that's the code i'm working with
[12:08:29] <andrewSC> does line 2 and line 11 have something to do with what I'm seeing?
[12:08:52] <NoiseEee> andrewSC: presumably you have a click listener firing that function??
[12:09:01] <andrewSC> hmmmm
[12:09:44] <andrewSC> NoiseEee: ah no, that function is fired when the DOM is ready
[12:09:44] <OnceMe> Ungy:http://jsfiddle.net/WPaSk/1/ like that?
[12:09:56] <Ungy> why are you mixing div's and sections?
[12:09:56] <andrewSC> misunderstood your question there
[12:10:07] <OnceMe> NoiseEee:well, why does thing at FB works?
[12:10:18] <andrewSC> Ungy: using Zurb foundation framework and that's what they do
[12:10:51] <NoiseEee> OnceMe: i don't care, nobody in real life is using firefox 3.0.8, im just saying you are wasting your time.  if someone is really interested in loading a 3-year-old version of ubuntu on their computer, the moment it connects to the internet it will be upgraded.
[12:11:30] <OnceMe> yeah, but I want to know what the issue is..
[12:11:51] <Ungy> did you try the timeout
[12:11:58] <shoky> and did you check the console
[12:12:28] <OnceMe> Ungy:not yet, I dont have live cd atm, it was tested at my home
[12:12:33] <javalover> how do I call a function & then change the text of the element that called that function?
[12:12:39] <Ungy> hahaha
[12:12:55] <andrewSC> what's even more weird about this is the display/webpage will update to show the last element that was appended
[12:13:06] <andrewSC> and once i click on that it will show the first element that was appended
[12:13:09] <javalover> I.E.  doThis();  function doThis(){   this.text = "hi";}
[12:13:17] <shoky> javalover: elements don't call functions
[12:13:20] <Ungy> javalover well first what event are you looking to change on
[12:13:29] <andrewSC> the fact that i store the result of a selector into a var than act on that var doesn't change anything
[12:13:40] <javalover> honestly I just want my button that I click tochange itself after the database entry
[12:13:54] <javalover> so far my function submits the data & I get a callback response and it's fine
[12:13:55] <shoky> so you want a click handler
[12:14:05] <javalover> just have to then go "k been submitted say submitted"
[12:14:11] <Ungy> javalover might I make a suggestion?
[12:14:15] <javalover> of course
[12:14:32] <javalover> Ungy: that's what i'm asking questions for :-)
[12:14:34] <Ungy> javalover I woudl either disable and display a different message or show and hide another button
[12:14:48] <javalover> yes this did cross my mind
[12:14:51] <javalover> to prevent multiple clicks
[12:14:57] <Ungy> that is correct sir
[12:15:07] <Ungy> especiallyif your using post
[12:15:08] <javalover> how would you go about doing that instead?
[12:15:20] <javalover> and I am using .post
[12:15:21] <Ungy> does it have an ID?
[12:15:25] <javalover> yeah
[12:15:44] <javalover> it's also calling the function so I assume I have access to it on the first function call
[12:16:08] <defaultro> hey guys, I'm not sure if what I'm thinking is right. I just joined a team, I've been with them in a month. I'm supporting a web application that uses jquery/javascript, etc. Our web application are able to scanner add devices. I noticed that properties(e.g. resolution) of the devices are hardcoded locally. Now, I've been noticing issues such as inconsistencies. I was thinking that properties/settings should only be pul
[12:16:08] <defaultro> led from one location like via json.
[12:16:20] <Ungy> javalover OK now you confised me
[12:16:33] <javalover> well because, the button itself is getting clicked
[12:16:44] <javalover> so it already has an id based on the event
[12:17:02] <defaultro> oops, Our web application allows us to add scanner devices.^
[12:17:04] <Ungy> well if you already have a click even just modify the click event
[12:17:04] <javalover> perhaps not a formal id, but you can say "this"
[12:17:15] <javalover> this is what i'm trying to do lol
[12:17:23] <javalover> I just don't understand how luls
[12:17:26] <Ungy> well what do you want to do?
[12:17:39] <javalover> on click, change the text of my button to "submitted"
[12:17:42] <Ungy> you do nto know where the click event is?
[12:17:54] <javalover> well right now it's a bit of a dumbed down event
[12:17:56] <javalover> perhaps that's why
[12:17:59] <javalover> I haven't added a handler
[12:18:07] <javalover> it's just calling doStuff();
[12:18:13] <Ungy> so it is in teh tag itself
[12:18:19] <javalover> if I ad a handler it probably work better lol
[12:18:35] <Ungy> onclick="doStuff(); return false;" like that?
[12:18:36] <javalover> now that I think about how i've dubmed it down lol
[12:18:47] <javalover> umm, more like just doStuff
[12:18:54] <javalover> and then inside dostuff I have post
[12:19:05] <Ungy> OK so assign an ID
[12:19:11] <Ungy> id="whateveryouwant"
[12:19:24] <javalover> right i could do that..
[12:19:36] <javalover> but what i'd like to do is say "anything that called this, change text"
[12:20:28] <Ungy> $("#whateveryouwant").click(function{ $(this).val("Submitted").attr("disabled",true); doStuff(); });
[12:20:56] <javalover> I think you're right Ungy, in expanding on the function to jquery
[12:20:59] <javalover> makes it easier to do
[12:24:40] <andrewSC> NoiseEee: Fixed it, when doing the tab stuff with zurb Foundation and ajax calls you have to use a special function to get it to redraw properly
[12:24:52] <javalover> I think what's confusing me, is that i'm getting a response from the post method & I want to change the text after that response
[12:25:08] <andrewSC> thought it would be useful to put it out there incase you ever run into it yourself ;)
[12:25:13] <javalover> but I don't have access to the object....in variable format
[12:26:49] <javalover> function soPost(){ $.post(**,**,function(data){ //change text}); }   how do I change text on response?
[12:27:25] <javalover> or does this just assume i'll have an id.....
[12:27:35] <andrewSC> lawdy
[12:29:17] <BillCriswell> javalover: Where's the text?
[12:29:40] <BillCriswell> / change text would need to be $('.foo').text('Some new text'); or something along those lines
[12:30:46] <javalover> right I agree Bill, right now i'm just being simple though
[12:31:17] <javalover> and so i've written  a href = "javascript:void(0);soPost();"
[12:32:09] <javalover> I feel like it just can't be done in my simplified code but I could be wrong
[12:32:37] <OnceMe> https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/942140_531772196871663_2056478917_n.jpg
[12:32:38] <OnceMe> https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/942140_531772196871663_2056478917_n.jpg
[12:32:44] <OnceMe> oops
[12:33:05] <Ungy> javalover i told you how to do it
[12:33:34] <javalover> Ungy but that doesn't allow post to go off first
[12:33:56] <javalover> that's great to just disable, but on the reenable i'm having trouble
[12:34:40] <javalover> unless....I execute a response from my function....
[12:35:09] <Ungy> javalover then add a success function and make the changes there
[12:35:44] <javalover> I could do it other ways I was just hoping to do it this way is all
[12:35:57] <javalover> I feel like I don't understand scope
[12:36:17] <javalover> like when I call this, inside function doStuff();
[12:36:39] <javalover> what am I saying?  what is  function doStuff( this); what is this in that case?
[12:36:44] <javalover> I thought it was the object that called it....
[12:38:24] <javalover> hold on i have a theory
[12:38:45] <Ungy> javalover this is current object
[12:39:16] <Ungy> the problem if you reference this in $.post it now represents the post object
[12:39:29] * jedimind waits patiently for the theory
[12:39:31] <jedimind> surely, op will deliver
[12:40:50] <javalover> my theory is in how i'm calling the function, or the fact that i'm saying .innerHTML is wrong
[12:41:03] <javalover> but i'm not doing it in post
[12:41:08] <javalover> i would first assign to a variable
[12:41:33] <javalover> honestly right now i'm just saying dostuff(alert('this'); followed by this.innerHTML = 'hello'; but it's not working
[12:41:46] <javalover> of course the alert seems to be working...
[12:42:25] <javalover> and now it says this.style.color is undefined.... so something is wrong here
[12:42:35] <shoky> javalover: "this" will be the element where the event happened, only in the event handler function itself. any other function call can change "this"
[12:43:09] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this and http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html @ javalover
[12:43:38] <javalover> ok shoky so then how do I just retrieve the object that got called?
[12:43:59] <shoky> javalover: store "this" in some variable/argument
[12:44:20] <shoky> that's the most common way
[12:44:23] <javalover> but where inside dostuff() like dostuff(){var mybutton = this;
[12:44:41] <shoky> if dostuff is the event handler, sure
[12:44:55] <javalover> ok but i mean sure i'll try it
[12:45:01] <javalover> just seems i'll have same issue...
[12:45:27] <blindMoe> date
[12:45:31] <blindMoe> err wrong window
[12:45:41] <blindMoe> good thing I wasn't logging in to my bank account
[12:46:01] <javalover> dang blind moe you seriously blind?
[12:46:02] <javalover> that sucks
[12:46:25] <blindMoe> yeah braille IRC is a pain
[12:46:39] <blindMoe> specially when there is a net split and a thousand lines roll be at once
[12:46:50] <javalover> idk if he's joking lol
[12:46:58] <javalover> anyways shoky, still same error
[12:47:09] <shoky> javalover: i don't know what you're doing exactly
[12:47:31] <javalover> i have an ahref where I call dostuff();
[12:47:41] <javalover> inside dostuff I Just want to say this.innerHTML = 'hi';
[12:47:43] <javalover> but it won't work
[12:47:46] <shoky> that's not exact at all. and don't use inline event handlers
[12:47:58] <shoky> $('#mylink').click(function() { ... })
[12:48:06] <blindMoe> yeah that would solve your problem right there
[12:48:16] <javalover> he has a point
[12:48:31] <javalover> ok so the real reason I even avoided this was because
[12:48:38] <javalover> I have a loop that echoes back the javascript
[12:48:55] <NoiseEee> javalover: also, you're using jquery, '.innerHTML' should not be in your toolbox at all.
[12:49:03] <javalover> and it's hard to $('#mylink')
[12:49:13] <shoky> javalover: it's so easy.
[12:49:19] <asdfasd_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7HhYE_ddtQ
[12:49:20] <javalover> i guess I could just .mylink
[12:49:28] <javalover> i know i'm being lazy
[12:49:30] <javalover> ok lazyness end
[12:49:33] <Ungy> javalover a buttons text is teh value
[12:49:38] <Ungy> not the innerHTML
[12:49:44] <javalover> ohhhh
[12:49:49] <javalover> hahhaha wait lemme try
[12:49:49] <shoky> he has an <a> i thought..
[12:49:51] <javalover> then I do shoky's
[12:49:54] <Ungy> like I said look at what I gave you before
[12:49:54] <shoky> that's no button
[12:49:55] <javalover> I do have an a
[12:50:03] <javalover> no but shoky is right
[12:50:07] <javalover> i'm being lazy as F
[12:50:20] <shoky> ?learn @ javalover
[12:50:20] <bot-t> javalover, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[12:50:23] <shoky> time to unlazy ^^
[12:50:29] <javalover> hahahhaha
[12:50:44] <Ungy> <Ungy> $("#whateveryouwant").click(function{ $(this).val("Submitted").attr("disabled",true); doStuff(); });
[12:50:54] <shoky> function()
[12:50:56] <javalover> I know ungy
[12:50:58] <shoky> .prop("disabled",true)
[12:51:01] <javalover> I just wanted to do the lazy version
[12:51:19] <Ungy> oh yeah prop would be better
[12:51:20] <javalover> it's my fault i'm wasting everyones time
[12:51:35] <Ungy> javalover dude how much lazier can you get
[12:51:36] <javalover> omg i've now realized why people get mad at me irl
[12:51:36] <shoky> javalover: jquery IS the lazy version. you just gotta go through a bit of unlazyness to learn it first
[12:51:48] <javalover> I know right
[12:51:56] <javalover> it's okay i fixing it
[12:54:57] <mentoc> Is there any way to pass custom data to a closure?
[12:55:13] <mentoc> $("#foobar").on("click",my_func);
[12:55:45] <ph88> mentoc: hello !
[12:55:49] <andrewSC> if there are two individual ajax calls but each of those calls uses the same callback function, that function will be separate in memory and execution right?
[12:56:14] <andrewSC> success callback*
[12:56:32] <Ungy> andrewSC Is it passed by reference?
[12:56:48] <andrewSC> I didn't know javascript had such a thing?
[12:57:17] <andrewSC> if it's default pass by ref i think all hell would break loose right?
[12:57:20] <shoky> andrewSC: i don't see why it would be separate in memory? if it's the same function and not a copy
[12:57:43] <Ungy> andrewSC why woudl byreference cause things to go all to hell
[12:58:46] <Ungy> andrewSC take a read
[12:58:47] <Ungy> http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/javascript_pass
[12:58:52] <andrewSC> well if you reference the same function and pass the pointer to it by refer-.... hmmmm I guess there would be a pointer to the functions memory address but the actual execution would be seperate
[12:59:49] <mentoc> anybody know how to pass parameters to closures?
[13:00:37] <myosotis> mentoc, closures have access to any variables in the outer scope
[13:01:18] <andrewSC> Ungy: thanks for the read
[13:01:25] <myosotis> var a = 5; function bob() { alert(a); } bob(); should alert 5
[13:01:58] <shoky> also closures are functions and you can just pass parameters as you usually would..
[13:02:50] <mentoc> myosotis: by "outer scope" do you mean "global scope"?
[13:04:02] <myosotis> not necessarily
[13:04:20] <myosotis> the global scope is always available, but a closure also has access to whatever scope it is created in
[13:04:36] <myosotis> it can be nested several layers deep, and have access to variables that are not in the global scope
[13:05:42] <shoky> mentoc: for .on() you can also pass in data with the data argument
[13:07:41] <mentoc> shoky: what about with focus() Isn't it just an event object being passed through?
[13:08:11] <shoky> mentoc:  focus() is a shortcut to .on('focus', ...)
[13:08:19] <shoky> unless you're asking about triggering focus?
[13:08:28] <mentoc> no, no triggering
[13:09:00] <shoky> yeah only the event object is passed through, but you can get the extra data with event.data
[13:09:08] <mentoc> I can have a more specific example later on
[13:09:13] <mentoc> Maybe I should wait till I do
[13:16:43] <javalover> oh thank god
[13:16:45] <javalover> it works
[13:17:03] <javalover> i seriously have to change how my code is formatted, but it works
[13:20:46] <mathi> hi
[13:21:10] <mathi> what is nowadays best plugin to show a dialog box (like thickbox) ?
[13:22:41] <mentoc> mathi: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/
[13:22:47] <shoky> best is a matter of opinion
[13:23:04] <mathi> shoky, yep, and I ask to hear opinions :)
[13:23:15] <shoky> many people use jquery-ui dialogs. others use colorbox. mentoc uses bootstrap ;S
[13:23:28] <mentoc> :D
[13:28:32] <mathi> thx i'll give those a try :)
[13:30:29] <javalover> ungy shoki you guys here?
[13:30:54] <shoky> yeh
[13:30:59] <Ungy> no
[13:31:07] <javalover> well it works lol
[13:31:35] <javalover> but you said to disable the button....
[13:31:48] <javalover> can you really disable an ahref?
[13:32:07] <mentoc> javalover: using javascript you can disable it ;)
[13:32:42] <javalover> ungy said this : $(this).val("Submitted").attr("disabled",true);
[13:33:02] <javalover> is that how or is there another way?
[13:33:19] <NoiseEee> 'prop' instead of 'attr'
[13:33:23] <Ungy> not if it is a link you can only disable form values
[13:33:29] <Gho5t> waht
[13:33:34] <javalover> right to be fair I did say button
[13:33:34] <javalover> haha
[13:33:37] <Gho5t> there is no 'disabled' on an anchor
[13:33:39] <Gho5t> k
[13:33:41] <shoky> javalover: you can't disable an <a> like you can a button. you can unbind the click handler tho, or not do anything on it
[13:33:52] <javalover> hmmmm
[13:34:01] <shoky> also .val() won't work on an <a>
[13:34:11] <shoky> that'd be .text() or .html)
[13:34:17] <javalover> can i attach a value
[13:34:19] <Ungy> you can unbind it or rebind it with function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }
[13:34:19] <mentoc> Gho5t: in HTML5 you can put "disabled" on almost anything iirc
[13:34:27] <javalover> how bout just...
[13:34:30] <javalover> "clicked"
[13:34:36] <javalover> and check it true/flase
[13:35:02] <Ungy> you can add a class or another attribute
[13:35:07] <Ungy> up to you
[13:35:09] <Gho5t> mentoc: link?
[13:35:19] <javalover> what would you do?
[13:35:29] <Ungy> I would make it a button
[13:35:34] <Ungy> as that is what buttons are for
[13:35:40] <mentoc> http://www.roseindia.net/tutorial/html/html5/HTML5DisabledAttribute.html
[13:35:46] <javalover> but facebook uses the like button
[13:35:51] <javalover> and it's a link...
[13:35:55] <javalover> isnt it?
[13:35:59] <shoky> and we told you what you can do with links
[13:36:15] <Gho5t> mentoc: eh, that's a form element. not an anchor
[13:36:15] <javalover> yeah, i'm such a noob shoky
[13:36:49] <mentoc> they're catching on!
[13:51:37] <initself> \close
[14:19:45] <JFranks> All I want is 2-3 radio buttons .. when you click one, the others turn off, and then I can tell which one is 'checked' ... but for some reason I am diddling with labels and I had this code for 'disable/enable' label?! Why!? http://pastebin.com/kV5Xu2XS  .. http://jqueryui.com/button/#radio shows you just enough to implement the buttons but NOTHING to show you how to USE them .. (*facepalm*)
[14:19:52] <veQue> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrV2SZuRPv0 paper beats rock
[14:21:13] <c4ptnh00k> jFranks: give them all the same name. with the id's being different you will have a selector to check attributes on, but by giving them the same name when you click one radio the others will turn off
[14:22:14] <JFranks> c4ptnh00k: got past that.. only one stays checked.. jqueryui IS doing something for me there.. YAY.. Now I am reading http://ameronix.com/blog/2012/07/radio-buttons-using-jquery-ui-buttonset to see the docs that are missing from the official page. ;)
[14:23:05] <thinkt4nk> that's your browser and html that's doing that for you
[14:23:26] <shoky> you use them like any radio buttons
[14:23:44] <c4ptnh00k> didnt know they were special...
[14:23:51] <JFranks> Oh.. And this page says I need to stop using "input" checks.. and look at the label for "ui-state-active"
[14:24:11] <shoky> JFranks that page is pretty bad
[14:24:34] <JFranks> shoky: If it gets me a solution, and it's bad, how could we sum up the official docs?
[14:24:45] <JFranks> (for this example)
[14:24:47] <shoky> huh?
[14:25:07] <JFranks> shoky: I want to do this properly.. I want an example of this done right. Cannot find one..
[14:25:24] <shoky> what do you want done again?
[14:25:44] <JFranks> shoky: So now I'm going to go off and use some JS to fix jQueryUI ?? Ack.. feels terrible.
[14:26:05] <JFranks> Would be better to use it properly.. Oh how I wish.
[14:26:13] <shoky> what do you want done again?
[14:26:22] <JFranks> Lemme copy paste..
[14:26:35] <JFranks> All I want is 2-3 radio buttons .. when you click one, the others turn off, and then I can tell which one is 'checked' .
[14:26:50] <JFranks> How do I get the 'currently selected radio button'
[14:28:45] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/YKq54/1/
[14:30:35] <JFranks> Hmm.. I am trying .. really I am.. I appreciate the effort.. But what the console logs isn't helping me.. ??
[14:30:58] <shoky> it logs the one which is checked..
[14:31:24] <Gho5t> you know that you can just set them all to have the same "name" attribute and you will get that behavior natively
[14:31:38] <JFranks> Because you have 'checked="checked"' in the element.. so only one is 'checked'
[14:31:50] <shoky> JFranks: no, it's because they're radio buttons with the same name
[14:31:51] <JFranks> No matter which is 'enabled'
[14:32:15] <shoky> say what you want done.. stop complaining
[14:32:22] <JFranks> Please. Add another button that will console log the 'enabled' radio in that set.
[14:32:32] <shoky> what do you mean, the enabled radio?
[14:32:38] <shoky> all 3 are enabled
[14:32:46] <retran> heh... checked='checked'
[14:32:54] <JFranks> 'checked' is set in the element
[14:32:57] <shoky> so?
[14:32:59] <JFranks> 'pushed' then?
[14:33:02] <shoky> wtf?
[14:33:09] <Gho5t> how about "checked"
[14:33:11] <retran> all it needs is 'checked' to exist
[14:33:13] <JFranks> Can you add a button that will tell me which radio is 'pushed'
[14:33:23] <shoky> ok
[14:35:09] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/YKq54/3/
[14:35:26] <shoky> oops
[14:35:44] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/YKq54/4/
[14:36:42] <JFranks> shoky: Yay! Can you imagine how much better the official demonstration would be with your code included.. Not just making radio sets, but USING them.. ? Thanks! ;)
[14:36:48] <shoky> no
[14:37:01] <shoky> the description:  Enhances standard form elements like buttons, inputs and anchors to themeable buttons with appropriate hover and active styles.
[14:37:09] <shoky> it just enhances standard form elements
[14:37:19] <shoky> you still need to know how to use form elements, regardless of jquery-ui
[14:37:38] <shoky> jquery-ui's docs ain't there to teach you how to deal with form elements
[14:38:16] <JFranks> I've got so many messy implementations of button sets.. An example of how to do it properly would have saved me from crazy macgyver stuff.. same with that how-to I linked (so it's not just me)
[14:39:28] <JFranks> shoky: Uuuuh the whole problem IS that I was dealing with it like an HTML form element? I can't check it like I would a standard input radio.. not without attaching useless bloaty JS that makes it mimic a standard element?
[14:39:52] <shoky> sure you can
[14:40:11] <JFranks> Well it wasn't obvious to the learner (me!) .. ?
[14:40:31] <JFranks> Or it was obvious and I'm in here for no good reason? :)
[14:40:35] <Tomashe> hey guys can i use animate() inside function?
[14:41:24] <shoky> JFranks: sorry for checking it you just need to call .buttonset('refresh')  which isn't obvious
[14:41:33] <shoky> JFranks: that is, call the refresh after checking it
[14:42:05] <shoky> but when using something you should go through the API docs, which do have 'refresh'
[14:42:17] <JFranks> shoky: Hahaha I'd forgotten that one too.. That was a good bit of WTF too.. ;)
[14:43:23] <shoky> JFranks: so the only non-standard (but easily found in API docs) thing here was the refresh thing
[14:43:35] <JFranks> Gotta love it when you deal with code every 3 months or so.. just long enough to forget most of what you'd done so you go to look for what you did and it's complete nonsense workarounds.
[14:43:38] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/hPphQ/
[14:44:00] <Tomashe> hey guys i have jquery function i added inside my code to make the element position but looks like it just ignoring my animation
[14:44:09] <Tomashe> any idea, ? i paste a piece of code
[14:44:26] <shoky> `demo @ Tomashe
[14:44:26] <b-ot> Tomashe: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:44:52] <shoky> Tomashe: you can call .animate inside a function, sure
[14:44:53] <Tomashe> i can not this is HUGE amount of code
[14:44:59] <Tomashe> i can only give the link url to my real website
[14:45:17] <shoky> Tomashe: dont want to see the whole thing, just a minimal demo that shows your issue
[14:45:48] <Tomashe> ok will try to do something
[14:45:51] <Tomashe> thanks
[14:49:39] <eobet> could someone please check http://www.omakadesign.com/contact.html and tell me if they only see one line of text in the main area?
[14:50:27] <shoky> eobet: i see 3 paragraphs of text
[14:50:35] <c4ptnh00k> eobet: it's multiline
[14:50:46] <shoky> eobet: and a javascript syntax error in the console
[14:50:50] <eobet> interesting… thank you both
[14:50:53] <eobet> oh?
[14:50:58] <shoky> oh.
[14:51:35] <c4ptnh00k> ln 22 of your js apparently has an extra bracket
[14:51:35] <eobet> oh, haha, damn… didn't notice that
[14:52:03] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/olequh/4/edit -- once I hit "Close", the banner should not show up on subsequent reloads. But yet it does. Can somebody spot the bug? (uses the jquery-cookie plugin)
[14:52:36] <eobet> no it was one too few, and now I need someone else to try it again, because it's an image cache issue I'm having trouble with :(
[14:53:14] <shoky> still same text
[14:53:55] <eobet> shoky: yes, because you have the images cached now, I'm guessing… not even clearing the cache in firefox can replicate the bug for me, I need to go to a new computer that's never been on the site before
[14:54:43] <shoky> boytoy: it's not hidden to begin with
[14:55:17] <eobet> shoky: btw, I had to replace the fading slideshow you wrote for me with a slightly different code :) your version took too much CPU (but you did it in 10 seconds if I recall, so that may be why)
[14:55:39] <shoky> eobet: er i have no recollection of writing that for you ;p
[14:56:00] <eobet> shoky: I bet :) took you 10 secs, as I said
[14:56:12] <eobet> still grateful though, it was good while it lasted!
[14:56:34] <shoky> heh k
[14:56:53] <boytoy> shoky: It should hide once clicking "Close"
[14:57:24] <shoky> boytoy: hiding it in runtime doesn't affect next runs
[14:57:51] <shoky> it just affects the current live DOM..
[14:57:55] <boytoy> shoky: wont the $.cookie('super', 'hide', { part fix that though?
[14:58:01] <shoky> no
[14:58:13] <boytoy> damn.. why not?
[14:58:16] <shoky> all your cookie thing is doing is NOT fading it IN
[14:58:34] <shoky> boytoy: put display:none  in your css..
[14:59:16] <boytoy> hmmm
[14:59:45] <naquad> did someone here use plupload? is there any way to make it don't clear queue after upload?
[15:02:00] <boytoy> shoky: im a bit slow im not sure if i get that..
[15:02:20] <boytoy> shoky: wouldnt display none just hide it from everyone?
[15:02:40] <shoky> boytoy: yes, but on first run, the cookie is not set, so you have the fade-in ..
[15:02:44] <zizzl> hey guys, learning here... I have this http://jsfiddle.net/eVsAp/ (it looks better on the live site, just set this up for testing) and it works like I want but if you hover over it and hover off quickly, sometimes it will just fade away or disappear etc.. Any suggestions? I'm sure I have it written badly.
[15:02:52] <boytoy> ah ofcourse
[15:03:20] <boytoy> now i get it - wicked awesome thank you shoky
[15:03:59] <eobet> what the flying fuck! can a jpeg, in the process of loading, actually report its height as smaller than it really is with jquery????
[15:05:02] <shoky> eobet: you shouldn't check its height before its loaded
[15:05:32] <shoky> that said, no idea if what you said should happen or not
[15:06:41] <eobet> shoky: for that website you just tested, I used a home rolled pre-loader, a downloaded pre-loader, and now something called imageLoaded just to make sure that I absolutely do NOT check before its loaded… nothing seems to work, and now I find that the .height actually doesn't report null while its loading, but rather a very low number instead
[15:06:43] <eobet> Im baffled
[15:06:44] <naquad> i have a pop up window which needs file upload. what plugin can i use? i also need that: 1. only one file limitation, 2. additional params must be sent, 3. should work with both html5 and flash. any ideas?
[15:06:47] <eobet> stumped even
[15:07:03] <shoky> zizzl: an easy fix is to change the .stop()s to .stop(true,true)
[15:07:38] <shoky> eobet: i dont understand really.. why do you say "while its loading" ?
[15:08:07] <eobet> sorry, "before its loaded" then
[15:08:17] <shoky> why are you checking the height before its loaded?
[15:08:32] <eobet> I'm not doing it on purpose
[15:08:38] <eobet> I don't want to do it
[15:08:54] <eobet> but, regardless of which pre-loader I download and try, it apparently happens anyway
[15:08:58] <shoky> then ask the right question
[15:08:59] <eobet> I must be missing something basic
[15:09:08] <shoky> not "why does it not show the right height before its even loaded"
[15:09:15] <shoky> that's just confusing
[15:10:30] <shoky> eobet:  $('img').imagesLoaded(grid_text_limiter());
[15:10:36] <shoky> your problem is there
[15:10:41] <shoky> do you see it?
[15:10:57] <eobet> extra parenthesis?
[15:11:19] <shoky> you tell me. what do the parentheses do when you put them after a function name?
[15:11:49] <shoky> function myfunction() { .... }       myfunction();
[15:11:53] <shoky> what does myfunction();  do
[15:12:08] <eobet> runs it
[15:12:12] <shoky> right
[15:12:13] <zizzl> shoky thanks I'll try that
[15:12:24] <zizzl> shoky and I'll also research what that even means
[15:12:33] <shoky> eobet: and you don't want to run it yet in that line
[15:14:36] <eobet> shoky: serves me right for pasting from an example without thinking, I guess… I wondered why the example showed a parenthesis there, when I even in the very next line doesn't have one.
[15:15:40] <maxmoore14> anyone know how I can apply correct width/height to an image that is rotated 90 degrees with transform: rotate(90deg);
[15:16:15] <shoky> what's a correct width/height
[15:16:25] <shoky> and why would you need to apply it
[15:16:35] <eobet> shoky: thanks for pointing it out, let's hope that .height but doesn't show up now!
[15:16:39] <eobet> bug, I mean
[15:17:13] <shoky> np eobet
[15:17:25] <maxmoore14> shoky: I need to set it relative to the parent container, so when it is displayed normally I just do something like $('#myimage').css('width', 'some calculated value')
[15:17:38] <maxmoore14> shoky: and I leave the height as auto so it scales
[15:18:00] <maxmoore14> I have a user button to rotate the image 90 degrees
[15:18:08] <maxmoore14> I need it to re-scale to the parent
[15:18:51] <maxmoore14> so I tried setting $('#myimage').css('width', 'auto') and $('#myimage').css('height', 'some calculated value')
[15:25:27] <boytoy> At this "click to see photos only" thing: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/USyft/17/ -- how do I copy the href from each .title over to their newly cloned "photos only" photo?
[15:25:30] <boytoy> Am I right in trying to add unique IDs to the photos? (please see the commented code)
[15:27:03] <maxmoore14> shoky: any suggestions?
[15:27:13] <shoky> maxmahem: and that doesn't work?
[15:27:20] <shoky> sry, maxmoore14 ^
[15:28:26] <maxmoore14> shoky: no, it is giving it the right css settings, but it isn't scaling in the browser as you would expect.
[15:29:43] <blindMoe> maxmahem: can you jsfiddle it?
[15:30:56] <blindMoe> err maxmoore14: can you jsfiddle it?
[15:30:57] <shoky> maxmoore14: seems to scale it fine - http://jsfiddle.net/aAx2U/
[15:32:34] <maxmoore14> shoky: I'll try to reproduce in fiddle. Will you be around for a few?
[15:32:43] <shoky> ya
[15:35:06] <shoky> boytoy:  you are aware that:  $('.new img').wrap('<a />');   wraps ALL img's under all .new's . and you're doing this in  a loop.
[15:35:52] <shoky> boytoy: look at the resulting DOM.. you have <a><a><a><a><a><a>....<a><div class="item"...
[15:36:26] <shoky> (for each item)
[15:37:18] <boytoy> shoky: Ooops!
[15:38:21] <boytoy> shoky: But if I put that outside the loop, the .new img's won't have an anchor tag to attach their copied hrefs to, right?
[15:38:46] <shoky> don't put it outside the loop. fix it
[15:39:05] <shoky> you dont want to wrap ALL of them, just the relevant ones
[15:40:37] <boytoy> yep, one sec
[15:42:05] <boytoy> shoky: shouldnt this work? $('.photos img:first-of-type', this).clone().wrap('<a />').appendTo('.new');
[15:43:50] <shoky> .wrap returns the original, not the wrapper
[15:44:47] <boytoy> oh i see
[15:44:54] <boytoy> well we cant have that..
[15:46:32] <boytoy> shoky: but theres no way for me to target that .new img without assigning a unique class to it right?
[15:46:51] <boytoy> shoky: like as far as jquery is concerned, it can be any img inside .new?
[15:47:18] <javalover> OK WTF!!!
[15:48:13] <shoky> boytoy: donno what a unique class has to do with anything
[15:48:33] <shoky> boytoy: and dont understand your questions
[15:48:36] <javalover> sooo i have this:  jQuery(".mylink").bind('click.mynamespace',handler);
[15:48:48] <shoky> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/USyft/21/
[15:49:04] <javalover> and thenI have this: function handler(){ var me = $(this); alert($(this).attr('clicked'));  me.unbind('click.mynamespace');};
[15:49:22] <shoky> javalover: wtf is .attr('clicked')
[15:49:23] <javalover> does not unbind AT ALL!!
[15:49:34] <javalover> that's just a variable
[15:50:03] <javalover> anyways it won't unbind, WHY WONT IT UNBIND!?!?
[15:50:45] <shoky> javalover: http://jsfiddle.net/f9Arp/  unbinds fine
[15:51:03] <shoky> stop yelling
[15:51:05] <boytoy> shoky: wow.. thats gorgeous man
[15:51:26] <boytoy> bless u once again mate
[15:51:28] <blez> I want to select all elements that have a specific style and remove their wrapping element
[15:51:33] <blez> does .unwrap() do that?
[15:51:43] <boytoy> shoky: you're family to me now you know that right ;)
[15:52:05] <shoky> ;P
[15:52:17] <javalover> WTF!!!
[15:52:24] <javalover> why does it work for you & not for me omgggg
[15:53:25] <shoky> blez: yes, it does the unwrapping part
[15:56:02] <Tomashe> shoky: looks like its a bit of a trouble to create jsfiddle for that
[15:56:12] <Tomashe> would u mind to have a look at the real link?
[15:56:43] <shoky> Tomashe: ok. and remind me what the issue is again
[15:57:05] <javalover> how is this possible same exact code!!
[15:57:21] <Tomashe> javalover
[15:57:23] <Tomashe> whats the issue
[15:58:33] <javalover> the code I have is  exactly the same as this http://jsfiddle.net/f9Arp/6/
[15:58:45] <javalover> however in my code, itdoesn't work, it binds the click but does not work
[15:58:46] <javalover> wtf
[15:58:47] <maxmoore14> shoky: I see what's happening for me... it is scaling correctly, but it is getting cropped because of positioning.
[15:59:29] <blez> ok it doesn't really work: http://jsfiddle.net/WRmj8/4/
[15:59:35] <blez> double click on a word to select it
[15:59:49] <blez> it should unwrap the spans every time, but it doesn't
[15:59:49] <shoky> maxmoore14: you might wanna change the rotation origin point then
[16:00:01] <Tomashe> maybe u have some conflicts
[16:00:09] <Tomashe> can u show me your real code javalover?
[16:00:14] <Tomashe> on the real case that its not working
[16:00:30] <maxmoore14> shoky: yep. my first time working with transforms, so I'm just researching that now, thanks for your help
[16:00:44] <javalover> sadly that would take forever
[16:00:51] <javalover> but i sware it's the same
[16:00:53] <boytoy> $('<a class="packery_item"></a>') and $('<a class="packery_item" />') is the same right?
[16:02:20] <javalover> what I don't get
[16:02:29] <javalover> is that the bind for click goes off, just not the unbind...
[16:06:25] <boytoy> shoky: now with vids :D http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/UTpVw/3/embedded/result/
[16:07:19] <boytoy> funny that it got the sorting right.. that it didnt show all photos first and then the vids at the bottom..
[16:08:02] <eddiemonge> javalover: are you sure you dont want ? see .one()
[16:08:11] <javalover> i looked into that
[16:08:15] <javalover> but honestly this is just pissing me off
[16:08:26] <javalover> HOW can it work in the fiddle & not in my code SAME CODE
[16:09:51] <eddiemonge> javalover: try changing the alert to console.log. and its weird you are defining a function in a function to be used in that same function instead of an anonymouse function
[16:11:39] <javalover> look I just want to unbind on click & rebind after I get response from server
[16:11:51] <javalover> but this should work regaurdless of it being weird
[16:12:26] <javalover> and I know it's weird but it still works in fiddle WTF
[16:13:40] <eddiemonge> javalover: why worry about all that binding? why not just use a flag?
[16:14:02] <javalover> good point
[16:14:33] <javalover> however it works in fiddle so it should work here...
[16:14:59] <blindMoe> yeah but since we cannot see your live code we get to guess why it isn't ;)
[16:16:33] <javalover> i'm guessing lol
[16:16:42] <javalover> sooo stupid that it works was hoping it was a real re ason
[16:16:45] <javalover> but sadly it is me
[16:16:51] <abjorn> :O
[16:19:46] <eddiemonge> javalover: have you taken that same exact code and put it, and only it (With jquery of course) in your code?
[16:30:05] <boytoy> shoky: works great with music as well: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/UTpVw/8/embedded/result/
[16:30:20] <boytoy> thanks again man
[16:45:41] <fartface> Is there a better way to create XML elements in jQuery than using something like var xml_element = document.createElement('element') and then xml_element.innerText('Derp')?
[16:46:16] <ryanneufeld> fartface: yeah, $('<div></div>') for example
[16:46:25] <fartface> If I use $.parseXML(), then try to create a new element using document.createElement, I can't use "append()",
[16:46:38] <mayhew> fartface: $('<element />', {'text': 'Derp'});
[16:46:47] <fartface> That's it, eh?
[16:46:54] <fartface> One second
[16:47:00] <ryanneufeld> oh man, I forgot about that sig mayhew
[16:47:10] <mayhew> fartface: yup, and it returns a jQuery object so append will work
[16:47:29] <fartface> Oh hell yeah.
[16:48:50] <fartface> That's awesome.  I'm working on this boner of a site that is a whole pile of XML and some of it is already loaded and some needs to be created on the fly, so I keep throwing all kinds of uncaught exceptions, because sometimes I would need to use append (if it was already existing when the page loads) and sometimes I'd need to use appendChild (if it was created using document.createElement).  Huge pain!
[16:48:52] <fartface> So thanks!
[16:49:04] <javalover> OMG!
[16:49:14] <javalover> whose ready for the solution I know you wanna hear it
[16:49:40] <javalover> multiple versions of jquery, redifined using var jq123 = jQuery.noconflict(); HELLO
[16:50:00] <javalover> fml
[16:50:55] <mayhew> fartface: if you ever need to convert a normal DOM element to a jQuery element, just wrap it with $() and it "upgrades" it
[16:51:37] <fartface> Regardless of how much I learn, I always feel like a junior, lol
[16:51:39] <fartface> Thanks so much!
[16:51:54] <mayhew> fartface: anytime!
[17:17:11] <Lindrian> Hello. I've been using a plugin named "tipsy" which now has stopped working since it used "live". Does anybody want to help me fix so that it works with the new syntax? It's a very simple plugin.
[17:17:23] <Lindrian> I don't think the creator works on it any longer.
[17:20:51] <Lindrian> nevermind, google fixed it.
[17:23:56] <igcewieling1> jQuery 1.10.1  I have a form with multiple checkboxes with the name="to_codec[]" attribute.  the [] syntax makes all items arrive in PHP as an array.   I'm trying to iterate through all the currently checked to_codec items and get the val().     If I try iterating over to_codec[] jquery gives me error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '2' in wav     "wav" is the value.
[17:23:59] <Es0teric> I have a question -- why is it that getJSON spits a crossDomain error when i use localhost on port 9200?
[17:24:07] <igcewieling1> Can anyone give me pointers on how to handle this?
[17:24:35] <igcewieling1> Es0teric: a different port on the same host is considered a different "domain"
[17:24:51] <Es0teric> igcewieling1 ok so then how do i get it to recognize it as the same domain?
[17:25:38] <igcewieling1> Es0teric: I don't know. 8-|  If I was doing it I would put it all on the same host/port if possible.   If not, I'd ask here. 8-)
[17:25:52] <Es0teric> igcewieling1 i am using elasticsearch so no that is not possible
[17:27:57] <igcewieling1> an example of what I'm trying:  $.each($('#upload input[name="to_codec[]"]').val(), function(key, value) {
[17:30:35] <HarryPitfall> put a class on these checkboxes
[17:30:36] <igcewieling1> heh, an easier way would be to assign each element to a common class and iterate through that
[17:30:47] <igcewieling1> HarryPitfall: I must be psychic
[17:30:53] <HarryPitfall> :3
[17:31:04] <HarryPitfall> nope, is the most direct solution
[17:31:12] <HarryPitfall> lol
[17:31:31] <HarryPitfall> don't work? use a class!
[17:33:53] <Lindrian> Whats the change between 1.9.1 and 1.10.1?
[17:34:03] <Lindrian> Tons of shit seems to break when switching to the later version.
[17:34:07] <Lindrian> Lets not even get started on 2.x
[17:40:34] <igcewieling1> .each($('.to_codec'), function(key, value) {    when I console.log it prints the actual html.   .to_codec are form checkboxes
[17:41:12] <igcewieling1> so of course value.val() doesn't work.   Any suggestions?   As you can tell I'm a but of a n00b.
[17:42:30] <Lindrian> SCRIPT5007: Unable to get property 'opera' of undefined or null reference
[17:42:30] <Lindrian> jquery.snippet.min.js, line 12 character 2320
[17:42:37] <Lindrian> IE7 is just full of fun isnt it.
[17:46:39] <proliberate> igcewieling1: could you provide a little more context?
[17:47:03] <proliberate> Oh nvm
[17:47:08] <proliberate> Saw that you wrote more further up
[17:47:09] <proliberate> Reading
[17:47:20] <wad> jqueryui question: In several places in my code, one line will open modal dialog #1, then the next will open modal dialog #2. The problem is, the user sees dialog #2, clicks OK, then sees dialog #1. There is a "moveToTop" method... but what I need is "moveToBottom". Or am I doing this wrong?
[17:47:35] <igcewieling1> proliberate: I managed to fix it based on some example I found on the web.  changed what I show above to $.each($('.to_codec'), function() { console.log(this.value); ...
[17:48:21] <wad> I could implement a sort of "dialog stack" feature... but I'm hoping there is a built-in way to solve this issue.
[17:49:02] <proliberate> Ah, excellent, glad you fixed it. 'this' is fun :)
[17:51:54] <shoky> wad: why not open #2 first
[17:52:06] <shoky> wad: or moveToTop on #1
[17:53:03] <wad> shoky, I tried that. I reversed the order in which they open. But then it started getting complicated, because logically, I was having to reverse the order in which things were happening.
[17:53:27] <wad> Seems to make more sense to have an option for a new dialog to open underneath existing ones.
[17:54:02] <shoky> i don't see how that complicates things. nor why you can't use moveToTop on the one you wanna move to top
[17:56:07] <wad> Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let's say that I have a dialog to notify of events. One event happens at 1 PM, and another at 2 PM. In the code, it handles events chronologically.
[17:56:15] <wad> So, at 1 PM it will display the 1PM dialog.
[17:56:27] <wad> Which will tell the user what happened at 1PM.
[17:56:37] <wad> Then, say the user wasn't there, and didn't close the dialog.
[17:56:47] <wad> At 2PM, the 2PM dialog displays, on top of the 1PM dialog.
[17:56:51] <shoky> fiddle, please. i have no idea what you're talking about
[17:56:57] <wad> Okay.
[17:57:03] * wad goes to make a fiddle.
[17:58:11] <shoky> ok i see what you're talking about kinda.. though it'd make more sense to me to stuff all the "alerts" in the same dialog
[18:00:57] <shoky> anyway that's not a common usage, so there's no public API for what you're asking, but it's very simple to do it on your own with a bunch of moveToTop calls
[18:07:06] <shoky> wad: http://jsfiddle.net/n6t3s/
[18:07:48] <wad> hey!
[18:08:00] <wad> Maybe my understanding of "moveToTop" is backwards!
[18:08:02] * wad tries it.
[18:08:24] <shoky> i'm moving the already-opened dialogs to top, not the new one
[18:11:27] * wad looks at some more
[18:13:24] <wad> shoky, I'm rather new to jQuery and JavaScript. What does this do? var dialogs = $();
[18:13:34] <wad> I know that $ is the jQuery function....
[18:13:44] <wad> But what does it mean to assign that to a variable?
[18:15:30] <shoky> it's an empty jquery collection/object
[18:15:52] <wad> hmm
[18:21:51] <boytoy> Why am I getting Uncaught ReferenceError: yep is not defined at http://jsfiddle.net/uw8dt/ ?
[18:22:11] <shoky> cause it's not defined?
[18:22:22] <shoky> yet you're referncing it
[18:22:29] <shoky> line 1.
[18:25:54] <ryanneufeld> wad, it stores a copy of whatever you selected. It's often referred to as selector caching
[18:26:26] <ryanneufeld> wad: var lis = $('li'); lis.addClass('active');
[18:26:48] <ryanneufeld> wad: is the same as $('li').addClass('active');
[18:27:17] <boytoy> shoky: i see
[18:27:26] <boytoy> was under the impression what i had would suffice, my bad
[18:27:34] <ryanneufeld> wad the benefit comes when you need that $('li') again later, by storing a reference to it in lis, you can use the same collection without jQuerying having to scan the DOM again. It's more efficient
[18:28:12] <ryanneufeld> boytoy: var lala = 'yep';
[18:28:21] <ryanneufeld> boytoy: string must be quoted
[18:30:18] <boytoy> oh i see
[18:30:39] <tw2113> know from experience eh ryanneufeld ?
[18:30:41] <boytoy> thanks man
[18:30:47] <boytoy> yeah because var lala = true;
[18:30:47] <boytoy> if(lulu) { // Do something }
[18:30:58] <boytoy> works just fine so
[18:31:03] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: what now?
[18:31:13] <tw2113> needing strings quoted :P
[18:31:33] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: yeah.... I feel like I'm missing a joke here
[18:31:52] <tw2113> more a stepping stone for some cheap experience
[18:32:15] <boytoy> i dont get it either :p
[18:32:16] <ryanneufeld> boytoy: true / false are reserved words. They mean something special to the JS parser
[18:32:28] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: you're not making any sense :S
[18:32:30] <boytoy> ryanneufeld: cool got it
[18:32:40] <tw2113> i'll stop trying then :D just ignore me
[18:33:09] <boytoy> tw2113: whatever ur smoking i want some of that :P
[18:33:22] <boytoy> or maybe not lol
[18:33:31] <tw2113> spicy beef burrito and diet coke
[18:33:57] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: since you're being so helpful, this is gonna sound stupid, but how would you find an element by height?
[18:34:34] <tw2113> dunno
[18:34:37] <ryanneufeld> I have a bunch of <p> and I need to get the first one that has a height >= somevalue
[18:34:49] <ryanneufeld> I'd use filter, but then it will still check all of them
[18:34:58] <ryanneufeld> and I want to stop checking once I find one
[18:35:05] <tw2113> probably grab them all and then loop them all, grab the height, and if above the threshold, use it
[18:35:22] <ryanneufeld> oh, shiz
[18:35:30] <ryanneufeld> $.each() stops when you return
[18:35:40] <tw2113> there ya go
[18:36:29] <ryanneufeld> perfect
[18:36:40] <tw2113> $('p').each(function(){ if ( $(this).height() > threshold ) { do something } });
[18:41:52] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: thanks bud
[18:41:58] <ryanneufeld> I got it sorted now
[18:42:17] <tw2113> cool
[18:50:10] <RRR2> apparently for online text editors a DIV is now better than textarea?
[18:50:11] <andrewSC> So I got $("section[data-section-category=5891733057437696]") which is great but what i really want is like a child-child-child element from this selection
[18:50:35] <andrewSC> besides using .children and drilling down two more times, is there a way to get the element?
[18:50:55] <RRR2> .getElementsByX
[18:51:03] <andrewSC> hmmm
[18:51:22] <andrewSC> oh oh my god
[18:51:24] <andrewSC> wow
[18:51:31] <andrewSC> complete oversight on my part
[18:52:13] <RRR2> one of the first things of JSDOM I learned..
[18:53:01] <andrewSC> yeah I was too neck deep in jquery land to realize the native function
[18:53:03] <andrewSC> durp
[18:53:13] <andrewSC> RRR2: thanks hombre
[18:53:31] <RRR2> jQuery also has a way to get childs by something, don't remember how
[18:53:59] <andrewSC> Yeah, I was looking at this http://api.jquery.com/children/
[18:54:20] <andrewSC> but for whatever reason either i was botching the child selector or it doesn't recurse into the children
[18:54:29] * andrewSC shrugs
[18:55:13] <RRR2> No.. it was something else..
[18:55:32] <Nubcake> Hi everyone
[18:57:42] <RRR2> I think $.fn.find does something similar
[18:57:49] <RRR2> dunno how it works though
[18:58:39] <andrewSC> hmmm
[18:58:44] <andrewSC> Nubcake: hi2u
[18:59:36] <Nubcake> I'm a total noob in jquery so i'm gonna ask a simple question first,
[18:59:36] <Nubcake> for example if i have an image based menu , on hover it changes image with css ( menu a and menu a:hover ) now what i want to do is these forum elements to change on hover SLOWLY , about 0.3s . tried CSS transition but that worked only for Chrome , i need that for all browsers , well IE isnt important thought.
[18:59:36] <Nubcake> now my question is , is there any simple way to apply hovers on a 0.3s duration with jquery ? ps not only for that menu , i want to apply that to few more divs with buttons/banners.
[19:00:28] <RRR2> setTimeout?
[19:01:14] <Nubcake> RRR2 , well i tried .hover(function() { $(this).fadeOut(300); but that didnt work at all , css toke over it
[19:01:41] <RRR2> then remove the CSS
[19:01:47] <RRR2> wait..
[19:01:55] <RRR2> it should override the CSS, right?
[19:01:57] <RRR2> Nevermind
[19:01:58] <systemfault> Just use CSS transitions.. they work everywhere except old IEs.
[19:02:03] <Nubcake> RRR2 , now there are like 10 buttons , how will i write all the images for each than ?
[19:02:27] <Nubcake> systemfault na that doesnt work for images , only for color
[19:02:57] <systemfault> afaik, opacity transitions work for anything :(
[19:08:36] <Nubcake> systemfault u still here?
[19:08:46] <systemfault> Yeah.
[19:09:02] <Nubcake> well i've tried earlier this :
[19:09:02] <Nubcake> 	transition-property:background;
[19:09:02] <Nubcake> 	-o-transition-property:background;
[19:09:02] <Nubcake> 	-ms-transition-property:background;
[19:09:02] <Nubcake> 	-moz-transition-property:background;
[19:09:03] <Nubcake> 	-webkit-transition-property:background;
[19:09:03] <Nubcake> 	transition-duration: 0.2s;
[19:09:04] <Nubcake> 	-o-transition-duration: 0.2s;
[19:09:04] <Nubcake> 	-ms-transition-duration: 0.2s;
[19:09:04] <Nubcake> 	-moz-transition-duration: 0.2s;
[19:09:04] <Nubcake> 	-webkit-transition-duration: 0.2s;
[19:09:06] <Nubcake> worked only for chrome ;(
[19:09:23] <Nubcake> xD pretty long code lol
[19:09:27] <systemfault> :/
[19:09:50] <systemfault> I thought you wanted 'opacity', not background
[19:10:28] <Nubcake> na , the background , ocypacy won't work here its a graphical design filled with way too many elements
[19:10:34] <Nubcake> opacity*
[19:10:59] <systemfault> Well.. then why do you want to use .fadeOut() then?
[19:11:20] <systemfault> it uses opacity...
[19:11:42] <Nubcake> tried , but it didnt work , it worked as simple css , instant background change on hover
[19:13:46] <k_sze[work]> api.jquery.com seems down here.
[19:14:28] <k_sze[work]> I'm getting 502 Bad Gateway, but doj.me says it's fine.
[19:14:44] <Nubcake> k_sze[work] 502 also
[19:15:40] <k_sze[work]> ah, isup.me is more sensible.
[19:15:44] <k_sze[work]> isup.me says it's down.
[19:16:10] <Nubcake> systemfault , i guess i'm gonna give up on that idea , its not like its gonna change much :P
[19:16:18] <systemfault> Ah ok :P
[19:16:33] <imsky> hnngn
[19:18:34] <Nubcake> its just with that css it will be a pain in the ... to figure out how to do that fade-in-out
[19:18:34] <Nubcake> .home a, .home a:before, .home a:after{
[19:18:34] <Nubcake> 	background:url('../images/icons/home.png') left no-repeat;
[19:18:34] <Nubcake> }
[19:18:34] <Nubcake> .home a:hover{
[19:18:34] <Nubcake> 	background:url('../images/icons/home_hover.png') left no-repeat;
[19:18:34] <Nubcake> }
[19:28:18] <k_sze[work]> erm, is there a jQuery API doc mirror?
[19:30:21] <k_sze[work]> There is jqapi.com, but it doesn't seem to allow me to pick the jQuery version.
[19:31:50] <CapMax> hi
[19:31:54] <CapMax> is the jquery site down?
[19:36:55] <shoky> is for me
[19:37:02] <shoky> ?down jquery.com
[19:37:02] <b-ot> shoky: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://jquery.com is down! (ECONNREFUSED)
[19:37:12] <bot-t> shoky, It's not just you! - http://jquery.com looks down from here.
[19:38:18] <CapMax> o well
[19:38:25] <CapMax> anyone got experience with glDatePicker?
[19:39:47] <RRR2> How do you make a modern text editor in browser
[19:42:02] <Gazpacho> rrr2: one feature at a time
[19:43:06] <Gazpacho> or you can search for "jquery text editor"
[19:43:19] <Gazpacho> which i would hope you did already
[19:50:53] <boytoy> At this "click for photos only" thingie: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/UTpVw/10/embedded/result/ -- is there a way to create an smooth transition between "Turn on!" and "Turn off!"?
[20:15:21] <shoky> boytoy: bad link
[20:17:15] <tw2113> shoky, when extending jQuery, ala $.fn.whatever is it best to use a $ or go with jQuery to assure success? same thing with .extend()
[20:18:53] <shoky> best to have (function($) { ... })(jQuery);   around your code
[20:19:33] <tw2113> having $ is not defined issues even though the plugin is loaded after jQuery and whatnot
[20:19:38] <tw2113> trying to debug effectively
[20:20:15] <shoky> does $ work in the console
[20:20:34] <tw2113> undefined
[20:20:44] <tw2113> console.log($)
[20:21:07] <shoky> and jQuery ?
[20:21:41] <tw2113> function
[20:21:42] <sammichToo> any functional difference between $(function() { }); and (function() {})();?
[20:21:54] <shoky> sammichToo: yeah, totally different things
[20:22:02] <sammichToo> I understand how (jQuery) works for noConflict
[20:22:33] <shoky> tw2113: then either another lib is conflicting or you're calling noConflict or somehow messing with the global $
[20:23:02] <tw2113> i'll keep kicking
[20:23:05] <shoky> sammichToo:  $(...)  is a shortcut for $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[20:23:14] <tw2113> thanks
[20:23:39] <shoky> sammichToo:  (function() {})()   has nothing to do with jquery. it's just an IIFE (immediately invoked function expression)
[20:23:40] <sammichToo> so after the DOM is ready
[20:24:03] <sammichToo> an IIFE has no gurantee
[20:24:10] <shoky> wat?
[20:24:23] <shoky> an IIFE is not automatically run after the DOM is ready, if that's what you meant
[20:24:36] <sammichToo> .ready() runs after the DOM is ready
[20:24:47] <shoky> ye
[20:24:48] <sammichToo> the IIFE runs asap?
[20:25:05] <shoky> yeah, like  x++  runs asap
[20:25:15] <shoky> it's a function call
[20:25:21] <shoky> like doing:  myfunc();
[20:25:48] <sammichToo> but when does it run?
[20:25:55] <shoky> whenever you run it
[20:26:02] <shoky> just like when you do:  myfunc();
[20:26:16] <shoky> asap..
[20:26:17] <sammichToo> fine. So it's in your first <script> tag in window scope
[20:26:29] <sammichToo> when does it run?
[20:26:40] <shoky> whenever that script tag is executed
[20:27:30] <shoky> just like if you do:  <script>  myfunc();  </script>
[20:27:35] <sammichToo> and...when is that script tag executed?
[20:27:48] <voidPirate> when the web render comes across it
[20:28:01] <shoky> after the browser reads it, usually
[20:28:12] <sammichToo> so it's best to stick it on the tail end of your DOM, as I've read
[20:28:24] <shoky> to stick what?
[20:28:32] <voidPirate> yes script tags should be at the bottom of the body tag
[20:28:38] <sammichToo> script tags
[20:28:58] <shoky> that would ensure that the dom is in place, yeah
[20:54:11] <bevacqua> hey guys, I wanted to share an article I just published on my blog, it's about writing plain javascript that does the same stuff as jQuery, I cover pretty much everything useful jQuery does
[20:54:15] <bevacqua> here's the link: http://blog.ponyfoo.com/2013/07/09/getting-over-jquery
[21:00:24] <aro> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://uploadsdev.offbeatr.com/store/products/uploadAttachment. Origin http://dev.offbeatr.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[21:00:33] <aro> has anyone seen that with $.ajax() before?
[21:00:49] <Gazpacho> why does your list have moon numbers
[21:01:22] <CWSpear> aro, both ends have to allow for cross domain requests
[21:01:24] <bevacqua> they're pretty :P
[21:03:35] <aro> i have  header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');   in my listener
[21:03:43] <aro> it should be allowing the requesting entity
[21:07:42] <CWSpear> are there any server errors, aro? is it whitelisted on the client, too?
[21:27:01] <aro> has anyone used uploadify? for some reason, it keeps stalling at 65536 bytes uploaded
[21:48:45] <igcewieling1> Are there channel logs available on the web?
[21:49:29] <shoky> igcewieling1: http://irc.jquery.org/
[21:49:47] <igcewieling1> shoky: thanks
[22:05:56] <Zesty> is there some kind of thing I should be aware of with this simple code? in IE7 it's not firing consistently.... sometimes this loads and sometimes it doesnt. get_distinct_id() is always defined 100% of the time
[22:05:59] <Zesty> http://pastie.org/private/jzaupbdfxbobzokgoaqma
[22:29:39] <andrewSC> you guys know how to get text to wrap inside a label without overflowing?
[23:12:51] <titii> Hi guys
[23:13:14] <titii> Is possible to make an event to the element to change its position
[23:13:16] <titii> <
[23:13:17] <titii> ?
[23:16:44] <Cork> titii: what do you mean?
[23:17:44] <titii> Cork: when my menu is resized, so some elements break down, then i would make some stuff
[23:18:14] <titii> but now i am using that with window.resize but i am asking for another solution
[23:19:03] <Cork> titii: there is no other event the browser generates when the sizes changes
[23:19:15] <Cork> if that is your questio
[23:19:20] <Cork> +n
[23:21:18] <titii> Cork: not at all. I am finding, if is possible to look the element positions, something like: when .position().top has changed, then make some stuff
[23:21:57] <Cork> like i said, resize is the only event the browser produces for dimension changes
[23:22:05] <titii> because with window resize, he must making that operation several times
[23:22:09] <Cork> and that is on windows resize
[23:23:16] <titii> i, see... and what is this? .bind("movestart",... and bind("moveend", .. ? now i find this
[23:23:48] <Cork> fake events generated by js
[23:24:46] <Cork> fake events helps you abstract the code, it does not reduce the load; it even normally increase the load
[23:26:35] <titii> hmm, so only way is to do it with window.resize
[23:26:43] <Cork> yes
[23:26:58] <Cork> that or something even more costly
[23:27:18] <Cork> though that said, most of the time you can solve most of it through css instead of js
[23:27:36] <Cork> but windows.resize is the only trigger for js
[23:28:05] <Cork> well that and the scroll event
[23:29:09] <titii> i see, ok thanks
[23:46:27] <vedic> Is there any way a msg serialized via Google Protocol Buffer is decoded and used on the browser? Anything jquery can do?
[23:47:14] <Cork> vedic: jquery can't help you, but you could prob find a lib (write one) to do it
[23:47:35] <Cork> at long as you can access the data that is
[23:51:01] <vedic> Cork: I am looking to replace JSON based ajax for performance sake to binary serialization. The size of each json msg as of now (i.e. one ajax call) is about 100 kb.
[23:51:55] <Cork> vedic: you could use gzip on the connection
[23:52:14] <vedic> Cork: ok
[23:52:14] <Cork> and it would prob be what gains you the most at the least cost in performance
[23:52:29] <Cork> (as the unpacking is native c code in the browser)
[23:52:40] <vedic> ok
[23:52:58] <Cork> ontop of that, json compress quite nicely
