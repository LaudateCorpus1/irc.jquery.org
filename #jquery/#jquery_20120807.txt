[00:29:57] <mazzachre> What is the better way of managing javascript code? Having a plethora of javascript files and load the ones needed at each page or putting everything into one file and loading it? Or a mix?
[00:29:58] <Nirvanko> How to invoke a public method on an instance of jQuery widget? I've tried $('#some_element').widget('method') but this seems to be not working.
[00:30:38] <coldhead> mazzachre: "best" practice is to use something like require.js or yepnope.js
[00:31:08] <FJ1> jquery 1.8 comes out today?
[00:31:10] <coldhead> adequate practice is to send a single minified JS file to the client and cache it there forever
[00:31:44] <mazzachre> coldhead: Hmmm ok, what about browser caching etc?
[00:33:55] <coldhead> mazzachre: for which solution?
[00:34:09] <coldhead> if browser caching is set up properly you shouldn't ever think about it
[00:34:14] <coldhead> your code requires some JS
[00:34:17] <coldhead> it tells the browser
[00:34:22] <coldhead> the browser finds it in cache
[00:34:27] <coldhead> and bam, you get on with your life
[00:45:27] <kreantos> hi
[00:45:53] <kreantos> on ie8 i get the message object has no method bind
[00:46:18] <blackspotwiggins> kreantos, that's probably true then
[00:46:32] <kreantos> but on all other browser jQuery.bind works
[00:46:40] <kreantos> is this a known issue?
[00:47:28] <coldhead> >_>
[00:54:34] <blackspotwiggins> kreantos, yes, IE is retarded
[00:54:37] <blackspotwiggins> it is a known issue
[00:54:55] <kreantos> ok, now i got it
[00:55:09] <kreantos> i have to bind it on the document
[00:55:51] <kreantos> $(document).bind('searchResultsReady' ....
[00:55:52] <execut3> you're trying to do jQuery.bind(), not jQuery(DOM/selector).bind()?
[00:56:07] <execut3> the first calls Function.prototype.bind, which is probably not what you want
[00:56:26] <kreantos> ok
[00:56:35] <kreantos> thx for the help
[00:56:40] <kreantos> problem solved :-)
[01:01:21] <coldhead> good luck everyone. good luck forever
[01:12:28] <FJ1> jQuery 1.8 Today?! https://docs.google.com/a/onebyte.ch/document/d/1MrLFvoxW7GMlH9KK-bwypn77cC98jUnz7sMW1rg_TP4/edit?hl=en

[01:30:09] <boulet101010> http://jsfiddle.net/uBrFc/ : hi, I want to avoid generating the "previous" or "next" button, respectively when treating the first or last element of the array. how to do this without adding an instruction in the "for" ?
[01:48:27] <boulet101010> anyone?
[01:49:04] <dgx> no
[01:49:25] <seutje> suppose u don't, without some awkward follow-up on the thing
[01:50:02] <seutje> shouldn't use "new Array()" btw
[01:50:17] <boulet101010> that was for the example, sorry
[01:50:29] <seutje> and using for (var i in someArray) is dangerous
[01:50:49] <seutje> it's an array, so you know the keys
[01:51:08] <boulet101010> it's for the example too, i just created this context to show the creation of the elements
[01:51:54] <boulet101010> so how could i optimize this, as it is awkward?
[01:53:09] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/uBrFc/1/
[01:53:55] <seutje> but since the values of your array don't really matter, might as well just use an int
[01:54:12] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/uBrFc/2/
[01:54:55] <boulet101010> ok so now that it's less awkward, how could i avoid previous and next to be created at the beginning or at the end of the loop?
[01:56:32] <boulet101010> i agree that my question is more aimed at "is this possible not to create previous or next buttons in certain cases without adding an instruction or variable"
[01:57:33] <computer2000> how can i check if the mousecursor is upon a certain element? i dont want to bind an actionhandler to that element, just need a one time check as soon as the document is loaded...
[01:57:57] <seutje> boulet101010: I dunno, I suck with architectural issues like that, I'd just put a condition in the loop
[01:58:17] <seutje> beats re-iterating over it and removing the ones u don't want, as it doesn't avoid generating them
[01:59:15] <boulet101010> yes i tought about this but it's not the fastest way and so it's better only not to add them immediatly
[02:00:11] <seutje> yeah, then I'd just put a condition in the loop
[02:01:11] <boulet101010> i just try to stick to the "write less, do more" credo ;p
[02:02:05] <computer2000> anyone pls help? how can i check if the mousecursor is upon a certain element? i dont want to bind an actionhandler to that element, just need a one time check as soon as the document is loaded...
[02:03:05] <computer2000> .is(':hover') seems to be the right way for me but it doesnt work to check an element directly upon document load
[02:05:51] <Libin> hello. I would like to build a HTML5 single page website. but I do not like the page to just scroll to a specific position which we click a link
[02:06:07] <Libin> rather have an animation and show the new page
[02:06:13] <Libin> how do I do that
[02:09:03] <Libin> anyone in here
[02:09:47] <jhsto> Hey guys, I how do I select the first match of search?
[02:10:16] <xec> Libin: try googling for "jquery scrollto", iirc theres a plugin called that
[02:10:59] <jhsto> And uh, first() wont work on me.
[02:12:01] <Libin> thanks xec
[02:12:24] <xec> jhsto: what exactly do you mean by "search"
[02:13:11] <jhsto> im 'searching' a page for a string, but many times there are many matches. I would only like to return the first one
[02:13:30] <xec> jhsto: what does this search code look like
[02:13:43] <xec> what is the result
[02:14:24] <Libin> xec >> thats just the opposite want it wanted
[02:14:39] <jhsto> $("a:first('Canon')").val(function(){
[02:14:41] <Libin> i do not want to scroll.. i want it more like the jquery mobile
[02:14:47] <jhsto> continues with blabla
[02:15:29] <Libin> i only want my contents to be exposed when the relevant link is clicked
[02:15:30] <xec> jhsto: so you want the first element which contains the word "Canon"?
[02:15:42] <jhsto> exactly
[02:15:49] <jhsto> then i want to execute a function
[02:16:26] <seutje> computer2000: I don't think anything is considered hovered on load, until the mouse cursor moves
[02:16:35] <xec> jhsto: maybe something like $("a:contains('Canon'):first").val(func)
[02:16:52] <jhsto> i actually tried that
[02:16:55] <jhsto> wait ill do it again
[02:17:46] <Libin> xec >> any other suggestion for me
[02:18:34] <jhsto> lol, i think i executed my program too fast after making the change
[02:18:42] <keirlav87> #join javascript
[02:18:43] <jhsto> it works however, thank for your efforts xec
[02:18:45] <keirlav87> oops lol
[02:18:53] <xec> jhsto: yw :)
[02:19:41] <Libin> xec: i am after something like this http://timothee-roussilhe.com/
[02:20:08] <Libin> where it is not obivious that its a single page
[02:21:04] <boulet101010> computer2000 what are you trying to do?
[02:22:44] <Libin> am i computer2000?
[02:23:16] <xec> Libin: unfortunately html5 isn't some magic framework that makes cool stuff available - you'll have to find out if someone have been able to make a script/plugin that suits your needs
[02:23:18] <computer2000> boulet101010: i have a button which changes its text when hovered on (using .hover()) ... now i dont want this behaviour to happen, when the document loads and the user has already his mouse upon the button from the beginning...
[02:24:23] <Libin> i know that very well. what i meant to ask was is there any plugin like that. sorry my question was unlcear ( probably a jquery plugin), which will do the dom manipulation
[02:25:07] <ili> hellooo! trying to use  a responsive slider plugin, it's all ok except you know, no sliding.
[02:25:35] <ili> wondering if anyone might like to take a peak?
[02:25:51] <ili> this slider
[02:25:52] <ili> http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/orbit.php
[02:26:46] <seutje> computer2000: it won't, until he moves his mouse
[02:26:55] <ili> and here it is not moving http://jsfiddle.net/AEfJX/
[02:27:07] <seutje> (or she)
[02:27:45] <computer2000> seutje: that is surely the point! any way to check if mouse is over an element without him/her moving the cursor?
[02:28:24] <xec> ili: 1) choose jquery as your framework -- 2) don't put html tags like <script> in the javascript field -- 3) include the plugin under resources?
[02:29:04] <seutje> computer2000: don't think so
[02:29:12] <ili> ok
[02:30:25] <seutje> computer2000: suppose you could try to grab mouse location and try to map it to an element, but just grabbing mouse location is a PITA, and I don't even know if that works onload without the mouse moving first
[02:31:00] <computer2000> seutje: no that would be overkill. ill look for another solution, thx anyway
[02:31:03] <boulet101010> anyway to see an example computer2000 ?
[02:32:12] <computer2000> boulet101010: unluckily no but its simple. i have a button with .hover() behaviour (changes text when hovered) ... now i dont want that behaviour to happen if the pages reloads and the user has the mouse already on the button.
[02:34:36] <boulet101010> you could enable the event with a timeout
[02:34:54] <boulet101010> or activate the hover only if there was a mousemove event before
[02:37:53] <seutje> yea but then if the mouse is over the element and moves just a single pixel, it's a mousemove and the hover will kick into gear
[02:38:04] <seutje> while the mouse is still over the element
[02:40:03] <demetan> can I fill dynamically a form field - with an ajax server response ?
[02:40:10] <boulet101010> so, if there is mousemove on the element at start the event isn't active, and if the user goes out of the element it activates the event
[02:40:29] <Phil-Work> demetan, yes - pass the response into .val() on the form field
[02:41:24] <demetan> Phil-Work : thank's, do you have more info/tuto please ?

[03:01:25] <alfredo> hi, I'm using jquery tabs and want to have other pages load inside the content pane of the first tab, is this possible?
[03:10:28] <jkarsrud> sure, use an iframe
[03:13:42] <alfredo> I think I phrased that wrong, currently I have 5 tabs with content, and the footer of the main page has links to contact, about etc. So I want to put like a contact.html inside  the first tab, without displaying a tab control.
[03:16:28] <sanova> how can i get an image response from ajax request ? dataType can only be: html, xml, text, json, pjson
[03:25:39] <Faenryl> @sanova set dataType to html and make your server send an <img> so you can do waht you want or set to dataType to json and make it through js
[03:27:11] <jkarsrud> or take the image stream from text/plain
[03:27:14] <xec> ili: also, it looks like the plugin you found depends on foundation.js - whatever that is
[03:27:17] <jkarsrud> and make an image from the stream
[03:28:35] <blackspotwiggins> you might want to base64 encode the image tho
[03:29:59] <jkarsrud> yah
[03:30:02] <jkarsrud> for sure
[03:36:55] <some_dude> hello
[03:37:26] <some_dude> Im seing something via post to my php script that handles it. $.post("http://localhost/http_test/receive.php", 'user=admin&password=something&message="hello kittikat"',displayResult);
[03:37:51] <some_dude> it works for my localhost but when I try $.post("http://something.com/http_test/receive.php", 'user=admin&password=something&message="hello kittikat"',displayResult); doesn't work. halp :(
[03:44:03] <ak> hello
[03:44:07] <NodeX> do you own something.com ?
[03:44:22] <NodeX> sorry, I'll rephrase, are you requesting from something.com
[03:45:34] <some_dude> NodeX, yes. I've found out what hte problem is btw. It's the same origin policy. the script has to be called from the same domain then it works fine. problem is I need to run it from a different domain..
[03:46:12] <NodeX> you need to run a proxy on your server to do that
[03:46:39] <seutje> ?jsonp @ some_dude
[03:47:43] <some_dude> seutje, elaborate plz?
[03:48:33] <Lindrian> Anyone want to help me bugtest my site? Requires regex knowledge.
[03:49:40] <seutje> some_dude: nah, I'll get flamed somehow, sry
[03:50:22] <some_dude> seutje, cmon wtf? just write whate you mean.
[03:51:08] <some_dude> seutje, ok nevermind got it
[03:57:30] <Rudeboy> How do you load a page after an animation completes?
[03:57:47] <NodeX> add the function to the end of the animate()
[03:58:03] <NodeX> animate({},300,function(){/......});
[03:58:43] <Rudeboy> NodeX: Is that what is referred to as a callback?
[03:59:18] <NodeX> correct
[03:59:47] <Rudeboy> NodeX: So if I want a page to load after an image animates, must I add the link to the .js file instead?
[04:00:05] <Rudeboy> Instead of in the php file
[04:01:05] <some_dude> Rudeboy, animate({},300,function() {
[04:01:28] <some_dude> $.(location).attr('href','your url'); }
[04:01:39] <Rudeboy> Ok, I think I have an idea of whats cooking, let me try quick
[04:01:40] <some_dude> something like that
[04:05:32] <Rudeboy> I'm just trying to get the page to load without the animation so long, I have this: "$('lightswitch').click(function(){  $('html').load('/home');", but it's not working?
[04:06:38] <Imaginativeone> how do I parse xml in IE7?

[04:07:30] <Cork> Imaginativeone: is it sent with the correct mime type?
[04:07:40] <Imaginativeone> possibly not

[04:17:52] <Imaginativeone> I'm just trying to crunch some numbers at work.

[04:19:36] <BBJames> hello
[04:20:37] <BBJames> I need the get the next .product-name on the page regardless of weather its a sibling or child how can I do that? http://jsfiddle.net/JWMHm/
[04:22:47] <Cork> BBJames: it will be a heavy selector how ever you do it
[04:22:53] <Cork> css isn't really build to do that
[04:23:26] <BBJames> would be better to give it an id like product_name_1 ?
[04:23:32] <Cork> not really
[04:23:46] <Cork> it would be better to structure your code so you don't have to do the dubble search
[04:24:38] <BBJames> I supposed I can do that but when I do update html just add the extra node code in ther.e
[04:26:27] <Cork> BBJames: my experience is that if you start adding id's to everything and select elements based on that, your code tends to be forced to be over complicated
[04:26:52] <Cork> so its often best to try and see if you can restructure the code so you can find it by simple reference instead

[04:32:14] <BBJames> Ok thanks Cork
[04:33:30] <davetarmac> I'm using jCarousel in tabs, but the first tab shows the carousel perfectly, however when I go to another tab - the width on the <ul> is roughly about the width of one item, rather than the sum of the widths of the contained items...
[04:33:38] * davetarmac wonders if that made sense
[04:33:41] <abletony84> yo.. anybody know how to make this text-only facebook like button work? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/fwXwC/7/ .. the text-only share link works fine though..
[04:35:53] <Mech0zWork> is there a simple some simple jquery that can give my giant table a "pageview" ?
[04:36:27] <Cork> abletony84: unless you have an api that provides you with the information you want, its not doable

[04:47:52] <toxz> hi! i'm developing a jquery plugin. now i want to fire custom named events inside of my plugin. outside of the plugin i want to react on this events via their name... any ideas or tutorials how to do that? thanks.
[04:54:04] <davetarmac> naughty time! I have a way to change the 'width' attribute in the following: style="overflow: hidden; position: relative; top: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; left: 0px; width: 244px; "
[04:54:54] <davetarmac> for some reason, the width isn't the sumation of the child element widths, so would like to amend it slightly on page load, as the jcarousel works fine after that initial load
[05:06:06] <jita> Is it possible to update the query string without actually redirecting the user to new location ?

[05:12:02] <toxz> crashev - of course
[05:14:11] <shoky> toxz: you just use .trigger('eventname') and .on('eventname',..) for custom events. event namespaces could also make your life easier

[05:21:28] <shoky> kelye: $('.grid').on({focusin: function(){}, focusout: function(){}}, 'input[type=text]')  if you wanna avoid typing the selector again..

[05:44:02] <peiper> hi, i have a quick question: i want to select all buttons with class xy and without class z. i tried this but didnt work: $('button.xy :not(.z)')
[05:44:46] <quicksilver> peiper: you don't want that space
[05:44:51] <quicksilver> the space means "descendant elements"
[05:44:58] <quicksilver> $('button.xy:not(.z)')
[05:45:47] <peiper> quicksilver, yeah works now thanks :)
[05:45:57] <Lisv> n #whatwg
[05:50:58] <peiper> quicksilver, can u take a quick look at this? it only works one time 0.o http://jsfiddle.net/pZp6H/
[05:52:04] <ezio> it works only when you click on the second button
[05:52:08] <ezio> it works more than once
[05:52:28] <peiper> try to switch both multiple times
[05:52:36] <peiper> it always should only 1 button active
[05:52:42] <ezio> i know but what i said should give you an idea of what's wrong
[05:53:11] <ezio> peiper, .live('click'
[05:53:13] <ezio> , fucntion
[05:53:20] <peiper> .live is deprecated?!
[05:53:21] <b-ot> peiper, memorised “live”.
[05:53:32] <quicksilver> yes, live is deprecated
[05:53:40] <ezio> okay .. then just take out the:not
[05:53:46] <ezio> :not
[05:53:49] <quicksilver> if you know that you can hopefully find the docs on how to correctly use 'on'
[05:54:33] <quicksilver> $('.btn-group').on('click','button.xy:not(.active)',function() { .... })
[05:54:47] <quicksilver> you have to apply the on to something which will always enclose the elements you care about
[05:54:58] <quicksilver> no point applying it to only the button which happens to match the selector at startup
[05:55:28] <Misha|Work> theres any way to get the scrollTop distance between the container div and the child div?
[05:55:29] <Misha|Work> like
[05:55:30] <ezio> peiper, i would do something like $('button.xy').click(function(){$('button.xy').removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active')
[05:55:48] <Misha|Work> <div id="container">lallaalallalalla<div class="child"></div></div>
[05:55:56] <Misha|Work> I want to get the distance between them
[05:56:02] <Misha|Work> there is any way to do it?
[05:57:17] <ezio> yes Misha|Work
[05:57:24] <ezio> i don't think that's valid html
[05:57:32] <peiper> thanks again quicksilver works now :)
[05:57:35] <Misha|Work> it was just an example
[05:57:43] <Misha|Work> I have a main div and inside 5 divs
[05:57:51] <ezio> <div id="container"><p>lallaalallalalla</p><div class="child"></div></div>
[05:57:54] <Misha|Work> I want when someone click on one of the divs
[05:57:58] <peiper> thanks ezio for your ideas
[05:58:04] <Misha|Work> it will scroll to the div
[05:58:09] <ezio> peiper, np
[05:58:11] <Misha|Work> with .scrollTop
[05:58:24] <Misha|Work> but for that I need to know the distance or something
[05:58:36] <ezio> Misha|Work, http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[05:58:53] <ezio> oops
[05:58:54] <ezio> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[06:00:13] <Misha|Work> ezio, I don't think it what I need
[06:02:14] <ezio> $(document).scrollTop($());
[06:02:34] <ezio> $(document).scrollTop($('container').scrollTop());
[06:02:56] <ezio> Misha|Work, would that work?
[06:03:01] <ezio> $(document).scrollTop($('#container').scrollTop());
[06:03:02] <ezio> derp
[06:03:08] <Lann> can somebody help me. This is actually not shown in the jquery docs. How can i pass an object such as options {arg1, arg2} to a bind event?
[06:03:19] <CodesStuff> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inpUOySXICY
[06:03:28] <CodesStuff> The plot to this movie was so depressing.
[06:04:07] <ezio> Lann, read the basic intro to events in jquery
[06:04:23] <Lann> not one of them shows any argument passed
[06:04:32] <Lann> i'm annoyed that i had to ask this on irc
[06:06:02] <CodesStuff> ?bind
[06:06:02] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[06:06:50] <CodesStuff> Lann: Which parameter are you passing the object in?
[06:07:50] <Lann> $(document).trigger('didreceivehypothesis', options); $(document).bind('didreceivehypothesis', function(options){ ...
[06:07:51] <CodesStuff> cuz if you're passing it into the event param, there is an example of it "As of jQuery 1.4 we can bind multiple event handlers simultaneously by passing a map of event type/handler pairs"
[06:07:55] <Lann> but they are empty when they arrive
[06:08:12] <CodesStuff> Hmm.. can you toss it up in a jsfiddle for me to play around with?
[06:08:13] <ezio> Lann,   something++; .click(function(e) { var smt = something;
[06:09:06] <ezio> myfunc(smt);
[06:09:53] <Lann> *sigh*
[06:10:34] <Lann> apparently the previous author found this so annoying he used a superglobal
[06:10:39] <rhino__> if I am setting a var and then need to access it on the next page load, how do I need to set it, then access it after all of the dom elements have loaded?
[06:10:45] <Lann> i'm about at that point
[06:10:45] <CodesStuff> lol
[06:11:01] <CodesStuff> rhino__: cookie, maybe?
[06:11:05] <ezio> Lann, test case
[06:11:13] <Lann> for passing a parameter?
[06:11:13] <CodesStuff> and Lann: Hey, globals are fine...in moderation! :D
[06:11:25] <CodesStuff> just delete it when you're done
[06:11:32] <rhino__> CodesStuff:  will a global var not work in this situation?
[06:11:35] <Lann> ugh, it's too asynchronous
[06:11:42] <Lann> i really wish i could just pass a parameter
[06:11:43] <ezio> Lann, why won't my code work?
[06:11:50] <Lann> it's nto relevant
[06:12:03] <Lann> i'm triggering and binding
[06:12:05] <CodesStuff> rhino__: Are you asking if you can pass a javascript variable to the same page on refresh/reload?
[06:12:35] <CodesStuff> And Lann: your problem is it's not within the scope of that inner func
[06:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> RobLoach: I have no plans to put jQuery UI on jamjs. Also, the use of package.json is really bad.
[06:12:47] <CodesStuff> at least that's what I'm assuming
[06:13:03] <Lann> i had the answer to this once
[06:13:06] <Lann> i just dont recall
[06:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> RobLoach: In fact, the use of package.json is a blocker for us even considering jamjs.
[06:13:26] <RobLoach> scott_gonzalez: How so? They try to keep with common.
[06:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> RobLoach: Because we actually use npm, so the dependencies matter.
[06:13:58] <rhino__> CodesStuff:  yes, the page is set up w/ an ahref on a burtton, if there is an error, it comes back to the bage and I need to access the var that contains the id's of improperly filled in fields
[06:14:05] <ezio> Lann, var e = $.event('click', myargobj); .. $('something').trigger(e);
[06:14:06] <rhino__> make sense?
[06:14:22] <Misha|Work> eizo, thanks
[06:14:25] <Misha|Work> just what I needed
[06:14:31] <ezio> Misha|Work, np
[06:14:31] <CodesStuff> er, pass GET params, or dump it in a cookie, maybe?
[06:14:36] <CodesStuff>  @rhino__
[06:14:46] <kelye> is there a way to change the type of html element ?
[06:15:08] <kelye> something like $('input').changeTo('textarea') ? :)
[06:15:09] <Lann> ezio: that does not actually work just so you know
[06:15:21] <ezio> Lann, http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[06:15:24] <Lann> that's why i'm here
[06:15:26] <rhino__> CodesStuff:   no way to set it as a global var and then access it on page load?
[06:15:33] <CodesStuff> kelye: A few different ways. You could retrieve the parent elements innerHTML (.html()), then .replace('your_tag','new_tag')
[06:15:49] <CodesStuff> kelye: You could also remove the element from the dom and re-append it to the parent element
[06:16:13] <CodesStuff> CodesStuff: When the DOM is reloaded, all of those variables are reset
[06:16:22] <CodesStuff> Er, rhino__
[06:16:29] <CodesStuff> I'm derpin' hard right now lol
[06:16:46] <Lann> i think i found it: http://technify.me/user-experience/javascript/jquery/trigger-custom-events-with-jquery/
[06:17:00] <kelye> CodesStuff: in the second solution.. how do i change the type?
[06:17:12] <toxz> isnt the arguments var in a function an array, is it?
[06:17:30] <toxz> i cannot do arguments.pop()
[06:19:00] <CodesStuff> kelye: You mean if it's an <input> tag?
[06:19:07] <kelye> yes
[06:19:17] <CodesStuff> Oh easy. Does it have an ID?
[06:19:23] <kelye> yes
[06:19:24] <CodesStuff> or anything "unique" to identify it
[06:19:36] <kelye> what i want is to keep all other properties
[06:19:40] <kelye> css class
[06:19:44] <kelye> etc
[06:19:53] <CodesStuff> $('#id_here').attr('type','submit');
[06:20:05] <Lann> for those that care to know it was $(document).bind('didreceivehypothesis', function(event, options){
[06:20:14] <Lann> you need a second param to do it
[06:20:46] <ezio> Lann, right ... i just did that explicitly
[06:20:55] <CodesStuff> ^^
[06:20:58] <Lann> no, you just didn't know how to do it
[06:21:18] <ezio> it's the same thing you just did there
[06:21:28] <Lann> yes except it doesn't work
[06:21:39] <CodesStuff> instagram.api(new Object({ cid:{ name: "ass" }, path: "feed/popular/", method: "get", data:null }),function(response,cid){
[06:21:39] <CodesStuff> 		instagram.cleanHTML(cid);
[06:21:53] <CodesStuff> dem callbacks, yo
[06:22:02] <rethus> why this:  var new = varname * 1.19;  (new= NAN)
[06:22:04] <Lann> ugh, sorry i'm bitchy after about 20 hours of coding
[06:22:22] * CodesStuff is sending Lann Midol.zip
[06:22:22] <Lann> eventually the energy drinks will stop working or i'll die
[06:23:07] <Lann> I usually go around downvoting people who give false answers because it has wasted so much of my time that it gets to me
[06:23:22] <heshanh> with autocomplete is there away to send a post ajax request?
[06:23:46] <CodesStuff> onchange event, heshanh?
[06:23:59] <CodesStuff> oh wait
[06:24:12] <CodesStuff> you'd have to check if the textbox loses focus
[06:24:17] <heshanh> no no
[06:24:31] <heshanh> the autocompelte sents the request to watever i set to "source"
[06:24:36] <Lann> 20 hours later i have voice recognition working in phonegap
[06:24:43] <heshanh> but it sends it over get / ajax
[06:24:51] <Lann> that was no simple feat
[06:24:52] <rethus> got it. var was string, need to use parseFloat()
[06:25:01] <aquatix> Lann: that sounds kinda awesome :)
[06:25:24] <Lann> yep, voice recognition via javascript haha
[06:25:32] <CodesStuff> I SHOULD be coding right now, but listening to disney songs is better
[06:25:34] <CodesStuff> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAACaVQNsQs
[06:25:46] <CodesStuff> Er, Lann: How are you grabbing vocal input?
[06:25:54] <aquatix> Lann: does the javascript do the recognition, or is it channeling to some service?
[06:25:58] <Lann> that's a native plugin
[06:26:01] <CodesStuff> flash or something? Last I checked you can't access webcam/mic
[06:26:03] <Lann> phonegap supports plugins
[06:26:05] <CodesStuff> Oh
[06:26:16] <Lann> the plugin was last updated a year ago, fml
[06:26:40] <Lann> honestly voice recognition with openears works extremely well
[06:26:43] <ezio> heshanh, what if you set source: function(){$.ajax(
[06:27:10] <Lann> not for natural voice, but for a set of under 20 keywords
[06:27:15] <Lann> it's almost 100% accurate
[06:27:31] <Lann> And you can dynamically change the set on the fly
[06:28:24] <heshanh> nvm figured it out
[06:31:01] <CodesStuff> Lann: Wouldn't it be better to just have them say a paragraph or two to calibrate their voice - grabbing each "block" of sounds?
[06:31:27] <CodesStuff> ex: "blue" would be two blocks. "blllll" and "oooo"
[06:31:30] <Lann> i want to add that, the library supports it
[06:31:41] <CodesStuff> then create a profile for the user based on their speech patterns
[06:31:46] <Lann> that's the pla
[06:31:47] <Lann> plan
[06:32:10] <CodesStuff> Ah. I've never really messed with vocals/sounds aside from parsing data from .wav's recorded on Skype
[06:32:17] <CodesStuff> dat robocalling, yo
[06:32:38] <CodesStuff> oh yay, OldCoder is here from #startups
[06:32:50] <Lann> hahaha i can totally robocall with this
[06:32:55] <Lann> that's not the plan though
[06:33:10] <ezio> the winning party in my country used robocalls to try to convince other voters that there voting location had changed
[06:33:19] <ezio> their
[06:33:32] <CodesStuff> That's not illegal at all lol
[06:33:33] <Lann> you can robocall for any reason really
[06:33:44] <CodesStuff> Not in the US
[06:33:48] <Lann> i can make a robocall girl that flirts with you and record the conversation and post it
[06:33:52] <CodesStuff> unless you represent a charity
[06:33:53] <ezio> CodesStuff, yeah it's sort of ridiculous
[06:33:56] <CodesStuff> or something
[06:34:05] <CodesStuff> Otherwise you're required to opt-in for it
[06:34:19] <ezio> CodesStuff, yeah but if your'e in the us you might actually call the election in favour of the wrong guy
[06:34:32] <CodesStuff> And if you're on the national "do not call" list, if you are contacted for solicitation, you can sue 'em
[06:34:56] <ezio> same here ... the conservatives should have been sanctioned and there should have been a re-election
[06:35:01] <ezio> in a left only country
[06:35:02] <ezio> ...
[06:35:03] <CodesStuff> Yeah. People were handing out cards at the local caucuses here trying to get people to go to the wrong location on the wrong date
[06:35:10] <ezio> how did the right most party win a majority
[06:35:16] <CodesStuff> ezio: What country are you from?
[06:35:24] <ezio> canada
[06:35:33] <CodesStuff> Oh that's some 3rd world shit right there
[06:35:38] <ezio> i know
[06:35:45] <CodesStuff> BRAMPTON, SON
[06:35:46] <ezio> it's embarassing
[06:35:47] <CodesStuff> ARF ARF
[06:35:58] <ezio> lol what do you know about brampton?
[06:36:12] <CodesStuff> I know it's fucking hilarious to say
[06:36:21] <CodesStuff> and very...er... indian?
[06:36:22] <CodesStuff> XD
[06:36:26] <ezio> lol brampton's okay
[06:36:36] <ezio> i live in london, ontario
[06:36:37] <CodesStuff> I've got friends all over Toronto
[06:36:42] <ezio> nice
[06:36:44] <CodesStuff> Scarborough and shit
[06:36:54] <ezio> i used to live in markham
[06:37:04] <ezio> the best suburb of toronto
[06:37:20] <Parhs> hello dudes
[06:37:39] <Parhs> is it possible to use sortable at whole tbody
[06:37:48] <CodesStuff> I live in Maine. The only bit of Canada we get are Nova Scotia, Quebec, and the ol' b-swick
[06:38:20] <CodesStuff> Welcome back, Parhs :P
[06:38:29] <CodesStuff> fix your Opera issue?
[06:39:06] <rethus> how can i roun a float 47.1111111 to 47.11 ?
[06:39:11] <rethus> or 47.12
[06:39:30] <CodesStuff> rethus: http://www.javascripter.net/faq/rounding.htm
[06:40:12] <tcial> I have a problem with this code; https://gist.github.com/3285424 in the javascript console I get '[Object] has no method popover
[06:40:39] <rethus> thats realy sucks - wonder why js don't have a second param for round()
[06:41:20] <CodesStuff> It doesn't need one.. just multiply :P
[06:41:38] <ezio> Parhs, what are you on about?
[06:42:58] <tcial> Any ideas?
[06:43:20] <CodesStuff> fiddle it
[06:43:26] <CodesStuff> ?demo
[06:43:26] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:44:20] <ezio> tcial,  i see exactly what's wrong
[06:44:27] <ezio> line 9 right?
[06:44:37] <ezio> or line 2
[06:44:40] <ezio> no
[06:44:41] <ezio> nm
[06:44:43] <ezio> line 9
[06:44:50] <ezio> $(this).popover(action);
[06:44:56] <quicksilver> rethus: toFixed()
[06:45:04] <CodesStuff> "this" will still work, ezio
[06:45:16] <ezio> not in a event call back
[06:45:18] <ezio> only in a plugin
[06:45:27] <CodesStuff> oh durp
[06:46:01] <quicksilver> also, I don't recognise 'isOpen' and 'action' as DOM object properties.
[06:46:13] <quicksilver> custom DOM object properties are not a good idea and don't work in all browsers consistently.
[06:46:56] <ezio> yes ... i don't know what the rest of his shit is doing
[06:47:00] <ezio> but it doesn't look right
[06:47:09] <CodesStuff> Which is why I asked him to make a fiddle.
[06:47:12] <CodesStuff> Aaaaaaaaand he's gone
[06:47:13] <CodesStuff> lol
[06:52:05] <lombrozo> how can I pass a variable by VALUE to a function? http://pastebin.com/Xmcyg5Cq
[06:52:23] <Oakho> Hi, I read some people on this channel talking about a CMS built on top of Laravel a couple of days ago but can't remember/find the name :( ?
[06:52:42] <lombrozo> every time the callback is called, the passed parameter is the incremented value rather than the value I passed at this time (http://pastebin.com/Xmcyg5Cq)
[06:53:12] <CodesStuff> pass it in the param of setTimeout
[06:53:19] <CodesStuff> or the "2nd" param
[06:53:38] <CodesStuff> the anonymous one
[06:53:50] <lombrozo> I thought that way of passing the value didnt work with IE?
[06:54:28] <ShawnRisk> If I am using Contentflow (http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/) and add a play button to videos that are added.  How do I make it so the video is automatically played where it is and doesn't open the video on another page?
[07:01:34] <lombrozo> why aren't slider-info-text-1-1, slider-info-text-1-2, slider-info-text-1-3 and slider-info-text-1-4 divs being slided down here: http://www.lombrozo.co.uk/test/my_jquery.php
[07:05:21] <xec> lombrozo: i'm not sure what to look at on that site, but i took a look at your pastebin and you can solve it with a closure in the form of an iife
[07:05:49] <lombrozo> xec: iife?
[07:05:58] <xec> lombrozo: http://jsfiddle.net/WGbT3/ this is really messy though
[07:06:37] <xec> lombrozo: compare to http://jsfiddle.net/WGbT3/1/
[07:07:11] <xec> lombrozo: iife is http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[07:08:20] <lombrozo> xec: thanks, will investigate...
[07:10:51] <Renari> Hm, has anyone here tried to use jquery in the chrome console? For some reason $(".video_inner").each(function(){}); throws an undefined is not a function error
[07:11:16] <lombrozo> xec: thanks, that worked!
[07:11:23] <xec> awesome :)
[07:11:28] <CodesStuff> Off-topic, but has anyone messed with wxwidgets in C++?
[07:11:44] <CodesStuff> frame is throwing "Impossible to create the object. Did you forget to add a sizer?"
[07:12:04] <CodesStuff> (it's in MainFrame::OnObjectCreated)
[07:12:12] <CodesStuff> Actually, I'll ask #cpp
[07:12:13] <CodesStuff> lol
[07:12:49] <xec> good idea lol
[07:13:23] <xec> Renari: if jquery is indeed included on the page it should work fine in console
[07:13:25] <ShawnRisk> If I am using Contentflow (http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/) and add a play button to videos that are added.  How do I make it so the video is automatically played where it is and doesn't open the video on another page?
[07:14:08] <rickibalboa> why would .height() be returning 0 on an element? the selector definitely works because I've tried .css("background", "pink") and it's setting it to pink.. $(..)[0].offsetHeight returns 0 aswell?? :/
[07:16:34] <Flo0815> guys, why is .on not working on elements which are created dynamically? only .live gets them
[07:18:00] <xec> Flo0815: because you're doing it wrong! :D
[07:18:23] <xec> Flo0815: can't start to guess what it is without knowing exactly what you're doing though.
[07:18:55] <xec> is your code live somewhere?
[07:19:59] <xec> rickibalboa: you're sure it's not hidden at the time the code is ran or something like that?
[07:20:18] <rickibalboa> Nope it's never hidden, always visble, it has elements in it but the floats are cleared
[07:20:25] <rickibalboa> floating elements*
[07:21:07] <xec> rickibalboa: do you have a url to look at? or a demo?
[07:22:10] <FJ1> is there a date for jquery 1.8 release?
[07:22:14] <rickibalboa> Nah I don't sorry, it's in a pretty complex closed development environment, I couldn't even set up a jfiddle tbh. When I inspect the element though all the javascript variables are set to the height (clientHeight, offsetHeight) etc
[07:22:14] <quicksilver> it's quite easy to start to guess what Flo0815 is doing wrong
[07:22:26] <tvaldes> Understanding that same-origin policy is in place for excellent reason... What is the best way to preserve a piece of information (cookie) across domains that I control?
[07:22:35] <quicksilver> I would start to guess that he's calling 'on' on a selector which matches the actual dynamically added elements
[07:22:47] <quicksilver> and not on some container which will ultimately contain them all
[07:23:32] <Misha|Work> I have div and inside 4 divs
[07:23:38] <Misha|Work> how can I get the number of div
[07:23:48] <Misha|Work> the number of child div
[07:23:52] <Misha|Work> when he get clicked
[07:23:59] <Misha|Work> I mean 1, 2, 3 or 4
[07:24:27] <xec> ?index @ Misha|Work
[07:24:27] <bot-t> Misha|Work, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:25:03] <Misha|Work> yep, thanks :)
[07:25:26] <xec> Misha|Work: that's going to be zero indexed, so if you want "1" for the first div you'll need to add one
[07:33:02] <wimpog> how can I assign tabIndex to jquery dialog buttons? Example: buttons : { "OK" : function() {$(this).dialog('close')}, ...
[07:44:45] <v0lksman> hello all!  I've confused myself regarding JSON and could use a pointer.  http://jsfiddle.net/PFMWL/
[07:45:28] <v0lksman> text(data.errors) always comes out blank.  I believe it has to do with element types but what type is a json element usually seen as?
[07:45:47] <v0lksman> if I alert(data.errors) I see what I want to see
[07:46:25] <faraway> v0lksman: is errors an array, or an string ?
[07:46:53] <umMMmmmm> Ye.. I thought I may find some use here, but there doesn't seem to be much activity. Not right now at least, besides all the joining and leaving..

[07:47:22] <faraway> v0lksman: or better put the json string you get form the server as a comment into your jsfiddle
[07:47:39] <wimpog> how can I assign tabIndex to jquery dialog buttons? Example: buttons : { "OK" : function() {$(this).dialog('close')}, ...
[07:47:40] <v0lksman> faraway: thanks for pointing out the obvious!  :)
[07:47:47] <v0lksman> problem solved
[07:47:50] <faraway> ;)
[07:52:36] <faraway> wimpog: why do you need this ? it has aria roles so in modern browsers tabs should work already
[07:54:34] <wimpog> faraway: the dialog widget selects the first input element. how do I make it not select it?
[07:55:33] <smsfail> looking for a simple Gantt chart. Anyone have any leads or open to dev one up?
[07:57:43] <Parhs> any ideas how to make sortable placeholder same as helper ?
[07:58:22] <faraway> wimpog: that's something i can't tell you i not really use jquery-ui cause it doesn't fit into my ui requirments
[07:59:22] <faraway> wimpog: probably you can search for the focused element on open, and blur it, but i don't know
[07:59:47] <wimpog> faraway: thanks, I will try that
[08:03:17] <shoky> aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh 2 hours wasted. i fell right into the "IE wont run your script if you console.log when the console is not up" trap
[08:04:01] <CodesStuff> if(typeof("console") == "object")..
[08:04:19] <shoky> yeah it's easily solvable, when you realize what's going on ;P
[08:04:23] <CodesStuff> ;D
[08:04:32] <CodesStuff> remember the good ol' indexOf days?
[08:04:35] <shoky> i do window.console = window.console || {log:function(){}};
[08:04:39] <CodesStuff> eg: yesterday
[08:04:46] <shoky> i still like indexOf :(
[08:04:58] <CodesStuff> just as easy to convert 2 string the search
[08:05:00] <FJ1> @shoky https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/js/plugins.js
[08:05:01] <CodesStuff> then
[08:05:35] <shoky> thx FJ1. but i only use log in my code ;>
[08:06:14] <CodesStuff> Has anyone made an HTML5 JS console yet?
[08:06:29] <CodesStuff> then just have a "debug" toggle to toss it in the dom?
[08:07:54] <ShawnRisk> I have a scroller that has images on it, and I append a play button to this.  How do I make this play automatically and not load on another page?
[08:07:57] <IvanKuzev> well....other alternative to console.log is the "debugger;" line...does that work in ie?
[08:09:15] <shoky> IvanKuzev, think so
[08:09:31] <crashev> is .unbind() good for unbinding .live() bindings ? all of them ?
[08:09:32] <shoky> but that's for active debugging
[08:09:45] <shoky> crashev: not really. there's .die()
[08:10:37] <crashev> shoky: thanks, I will try that
[08:10:56] <IvanKuzev> !q .off()
[08:13:02] <digs> I have a button that is created on a .success of an ajax call. I am trying to attach another ajax call on the click of that button. The .click attachment is called in the .success of the first ajax call. It works for some things, but I can't seem to get the ajax call to fire. Is there anything glaringly wrong about this?
[08:15:02] <shoky> glaringly? no. the button is already in the DOM when you attach the .click?
[08:15:37] <shoky> also, is the click handler called or not?
[08:16:07] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can answer my question
[08:16:53] <shoky> ShawnRisk your question is too general and vague, and is more than one question
[08:17:03] <shoky> ?demo @ ShawnRisk
[08:17:03] <bot-t> ShawnRisk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:17:25] <niix> Can someone help me out with this? http://pastie.org/4406349  I'm using FullCalendar and I'm trying to have the objects display on double click, it currently works but isn't actually displaying the objects contents and [object,Object]
[08:17:33] <CodesStuff> shoky: Answer is hazy. Please shake again.
[08:18:01] <shoky> oki
[08:18:47] <digs> Yes, the button is already in the DOM when I attach the click. Other events occur on the click just not the ajax call.
[08:18:52] <digs> However, let me get some code u.
[08:18:54] <digs> up
[08:19:58] <ShawnRisk> shoky: all I want to do is make this: http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/ in which I append a play button to each image, to play the video automatically, meaning without going to another page.  I want the video to play in that slider.
[08:20:44] <shoky> derp
[08:22:35] <IvanKuzev> ShawnRisk: you can add an .on('click','.image') handler and then put an e.prevent default to not go anywhere
[08:23:37] <IvanKuzev> after that you change content of div you want with what you want
[08:26:30] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev: trying
[08:31:43] <shoky> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ABNKQ/  putting href="#"  makes it not open a new url
[08:32:43] <ShawnRisk> shoky: yes but I want to play videos in there, so they are loaded to external files.
[08:32:50] <shoky> go ahead..
[08:32:58] <shoky> uhm
[08:34:22] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev: like this: $(document).on('click', '.item', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); ?
[08:34:38] <shoky> ShawnRisk i donno if you'll be able to play videos inside that slider...
[08:34:47] <shoky> it renders the initial content into a canvas, i believe
[08:35:17] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:yeah......we replace the canvas in that case
[08:35:53] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev: can you explain more please?
[08:38:02] <jorenl_> Hi all, ajax cross domain policies are puzzling me and I can't find a clear answer on google...
[08:38:46] <jorenl_> So I'm running something on a local file, opened in my browser. It includes a script from a server - say somedomain.com. This script is able to make ajax xcalls to somedomain.com. (right?)
[08:39:16] <CodesStuff> jorenl_: with jsonp, yeah
[08:39:26] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I have a .hover event that isn't working as I intended it to. Anybody know what I'm doing wrong? It can be witnessed by selecting a shape, then next then hovering over the 3 buttons found at this URL: http://www.decorgroupinc.com/store/builders/archmouldings/index.php    pastebinning the relevent code now.
[08:39:44] <jorenl_> CodesStuff: why with jsonp?
[08:40:04] <DeltaHeavy|Work> http://pastebin.com/SWkYSxGw
[08:40:17] <ShawnRisk> shoky: there is no way to render the content when I play video into the canvas?
[08:40:23] <IvanKuzev> ShawnRisk:you have an div with id "contenflow".right? so you do $("#contentflow").replaceWith($("<video>"))
[08:40:48] <CodesStuff> deltaheavy: which three buttons?
[08:41:07] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:cant play the video in canvas(atleast not that easy) but you dont need to
[08:41:44] <DeltaHeavy|Work> CodesStuff: When you select a shape (try quarter-round) then select 'Next'
[08:41:45] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:there is <video> tag for that...http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_video.asp
[08:42:36] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev: yes but where would this video play with that?
[08:43:15] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:didnt i just tell you how to replace the plugin with the video?
[08:43:38] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:i assume thats what you want?\
[08:44:22] <CodesStuff> delvaHeavy|Work: I'm looking at it. The hover is working for the text at the top and bottom just fine
[08:44:46] <CodesStuff> It's just if you lose focus and hover over the inner elements
[08:44:48] <CodesStuff> it toggles it
[08:44:55] <CodesStuff> try applying the hover to the parent element
[08:45:16] <CodesStuff> "shape-2_btn" JUST this class
[08:45:25] <CodesStuff> it should inherit the event for the children
[08:45:33] <DeltaHeavy|Work> CodesStuff: Ok got it. Thanks!
[08:45:54] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev:  This is what I want. The CoverFlow shows thumbnails with a play button in it. When you click on a thumbnail in the CoverFlow, wether it's the currently selected one or not, it should become the active one and start playing a video in the box that formerly contained the thumbnail of that video.
[08:46:16] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev: You are saying I need to use HTML5 Video Tag for that?
[08:46:22] <CodesStuff> np, deltaheavy
[08:46:54] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:yes
[08:47:57] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:the plugin is using html5 anyway so....i dont think it will be a problem
[08:48:11] <jorenl_> So... If I include domain.com/script.js in file://page.htm, which tries to do an ajax call to domain.com/page, it can only do that by JSONP?
[08:48:42] <pifantastic> jorenl_: would that ajax request be across domains?
[08:48:50] <pifantastic> jorenl_: yes, it would
[08:49:11] <pifantastic> localhost -> domain.com
[08:49:12] <jorenl_> pifantastic: domain.com/script.js would be calling domain.com/page
[08:49:27] <pifantastic> jorenl_: but the script is executing on localhost
[08:49:46] <pifantastic> jorenl_: fortunately it doesn't matter where you load the script from, which is why we can all use the google CDN to host jQuery
[08:49:54] <pifantastic> it matters where it is executing
[08:50:05] <jorenl_> pifantastic Then why did it work until now?
[08:50:13] <jorenl_> * sorry didn't mean to press enter
[08:50:35] <pifantastic> :)
[08:50:57] <jorenl_> pifantastic: I've been calling domain.com/page from this script domain.com/script.js on some localhost file, and it just gets the content of the page
[08:51:02] <jorenl_> what does jquery do internally? :S
[08:51:34] <rickibalboa> Would there be an easy way of determining how many elements are between n1 and n2 in a scrollable div, say how many elements are between 100 and 550 pixels in this scrollable div, not all elements just first childs
[08:51:55] <pifantastic> jorenl_: I don't really understand your qusetion
[08:53:11] <klocatelli> yes. add heights.
[08:53:20] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev: I am a bit confused, are you saying that when I hit play, I should be changing the image to HTML5 Video?
[08:53:38] <cambazz> hello, how can i say find the first .nextpage and figure out if it also has class disabled
[08:53:52] <jorenl_> pifantastic: I included domain.com/script.js in a file on my pc. When I try $.get('domain.com/page' ... it actually works. I'm wondering why.
[08:53:59] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:no i am saying :change the whole plugin
[08:54:02] <cambazz> nextpage is a class, but there are multiple of them, i need to check out if it has the disabled class or not, but only the first one
[08:54:31] <jorenl_> [however, I can't bind the beforeSend event or change headers, which is my actual problem - but first I'd like to understand how jquery deals with this request]
[08:54:33] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:is that a problem?
[08:54:54] <pifantastic> jorenl_: is the server setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP_access_control
[08:55:11] <jorenl_> I'm not sure but I don't think it is.
[08:55:50] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev: there is no way to do this with the current plugin? If there isn't that is okay, I just want to be 100% sure.
[08:58:03] <IvanKuzev> <ShawnRisk>:well you can try replacing diferent elements.it will be great if you can replace the image itself...i think its not canvas
[08:59:29] <jorenl_> pifantastic: oh, I seee it is actually sending access-control-allow-headers and some other stuff.
[08:59:39] <jorenl_> So that is the reason my request worked in the first place?
[09:08:40] <Misha|Work> I have an array with falses and trues
[09:08:56] <Misha|Work> how can I get how much false and how much true
[09:09:03] <Misha|Work> for example:
[09:09:10] <Misha|Work> [true,true,false,false,true]
[09:09:15] <Misha|Work> 3 - true, 2 - false
[09:09:20] <jomofcw> Misha|Work do an each and count ?
[09:09:26] <Misha|Work> possible
[09:09:33] <Misha|Work> but isn't there other way?
[09:09:38] <jomofcw> imo nop
[09:12:04] <pifantastic> jorenl_: possibley
[09:14:06] <xckpd7> how to instantiate a toggle animation for a dynamically loaded element?
[09:15:59] <ShawnRisk> IvanKuzev: sorry back, did you get my message with code?
[09:17:14] <Brodingo> xckpd7 use a callback when its loaded
[09:19:25] <lombrozo> can anyone tell me why $screenimage isn't correctly transferred into the html at http://www.lombrozo.co.uk/test/my_jquery.php ?
[09:36:06] <LindsayMac> I have got something really strange going on with my animations on this site. I have a single page site with smooth scrolling and have been working on a script (with help) that basically looks for the offset()top of an element and then triggers an event if that element lands within a few pixels of the top.
[09:36:26] <LindsayMac> The issue is that some times an animation is being called to occur on elements that do not have my selector
[09:36:43] <LindsayMac> ::grabbing code ::
[09:44:07] <lucenut> Hi all. I have a form running jquery.validate.js that the form validation isn't working. All of my other forms validation work. How can I troubleshoot this?
[09:44:37] <lucenut> I opened up FF error console and don't see any js error happening when the form submits.
[09:45:45] <LindsayMac> did you make sure that the selectors that trigger the validation match? sometimes its the little things
[09:46:02] <LindsayMac> note I have never used validate.js but its usually the first thing I always look for
[09:46:35] <lucenut> I'm sorry, what exactly do you mean by "selectors"?
[09:47:36] <LindsayMac> In my js scripts, you initialize the script by basically telling it "validate all inputs with the class name 'validate" or something liek that
[09:47:53] <lucenut> OK, right.
[09:48:54] <LindsayMac> lucenut:  usually just a few good first steps
[09:53:57] <ezio> i want voice
[09:54:04] <LindsayMac> ?
[09:54:04] <ezio> stupid bot-t
[09:54:08] <ezio> thinks he's better than me
[09:54:28] <LindsayMac> lol
[09:54:44] <ezio> I tell you, bots these days don't know how to respect their designers.
[09:55:44] <LindsayMac> ahh so you created the bot?
[09:55:52] <ezio> never said that
[09:56:17] <LindsayMac> Ohh... well figured respecting it's creator would be respecting you
[09:56:28] <LindsayMac> Oh here's my code for the aforementioned issue http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/57/
[09:56:41] <lucenut> What do you all think? My form validation scheme has always changed the class of objects to give them a red border. But now FireFox and Chrome are saying the W3 standards are to not change radio or checkbox elements as they are system elements.
[09:56:43] <ezio> what's your problem?
[09:57:02] <LindsayMac> I am wondering.. does stop() not work on .css( ) animations
[09:57:12] <LindsayMac> Do i need to use clearQueue ?
[09:57:38] <ezio> oh shit i don't know, son.  don't know much about animation.
[09:57:50] <LindsayMac> ezio:  the issue is that the script works fine until some idiot goes happy clicking and clicks before the scrolling and dropdown/fade in animation is finished so I am trying to figure out how to kill it OR just disable clicks while animation in motion
[09:57:59] <LindsayMac> son.. haha awesome
[09:58:06] <ezio> umm
[09:58:08] <ezio> okay
[09:58:19] <ezio> what you should do is unbind the event
[09:58:25] <ezio> or
[09:58:27] <ezio> just set a flag
[09:58:37] <ezio> isanimating = true
[09:58:47] <LindsayMac> not sure how to do that.. do you have a link to some docs I can take a look at?
[09:58:53] <ezio> and if isanimating then ignore any clicks by if(isanimating) return;
[09:59:05] <ezio> which function?
[09:59:09] <ezio> stickheader a.click?
[09:59:27] <LindsayMac> that is what I would like to disable clicks on while animation is in progress, yes/
[10:01:03] <ezio> http://jsfiddle.net/Etsze/58/
[10:01:44] <LindsayMac> gah hold on. Browser crash
[10:01:54] <shoky> that is so wrong
[10:01:55] <shoky> ;>
[10:02:13] <LindsayMac> waht.. my code or browser crashing?
[10:02:15] <LindsayMac> hello shoky btw
[10:02:24] <ezio> shoky, ga
[10:02:41] <shoky> hey
[10:03:20] <LindsayMac> ezio:  that doesnt seem to disable the click ...
[10:03:52] <shoky> use the flag i already put there: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Etsze/59/
[10:04:15] <LindsayMac> Ahh ok i see.. e.preventDeafult
[10:04:25] <shoky> no
[10:04:27] <jwmann> Okay, let's say I have a list of anchor tags and a list of images, I want to .each() the anchors and add an increasing #img1-2-3 to their href and then I want to apply the same numbers to the id of the image list, what's the best way to go about this?
[10:04:39] <shoky> the e.preventDefault() is just a more correct way of doing what you wanted with 'return false'
[10:04:49] <LindsayMac> shoky:  got it.
[10:04:52] <shoky> what i added now (the important bit) is :  if (scrollAnimInProgress) return;
[10:05:11] <ezio> lol that was almost my exact code
[10:05:21] <shoky> ezio: but your flag was bad and you set it in wrong places
[10:05:28] <shoky> and there already was a good flag set in the right places :P
[10:05:36] <LindsayMac> yea so it's saying to prevent default if scroll animation is in progress.. if not return normal
[10:05:41] <ezio> shoky, yes i set it in bad places
[10:05:57] <shoky> LindsayMac: it prevents default in any case. (the default action of a click.. )
[10:06:12] <LindsayMac> shoky:  so how does it actually register a click otherwise?
[10:06:15] <shoky> LindsayMac: regardless of that, if an animation is in progress, it doesnt queue another one
[10:06:25] <shoky> LindsayMac: how does what register a click?
[10:06:58] <LindsayMac> You said it prevents default in any case.. So if i have links on the page that I need to have clickable, i dont understand how theywould work
[10:07:12] <shoky> uhm  $('#stickyheader a')
[10:07:16] <LindsayMac> I might just need to do a diff of the files to see where you added
[10:07:19] <shoky> that only applies to specific links
[10:07:29] <LindsayMac> Ohhh.. duh
[10:07:33] <lduros> I have a jquery object and trying to bind a click to anything _but_ that particular element: $.not($box) -- this doesn't exist, any recommendation?
[10:08:27] <shoshy> hey, i'm using jquery and jquery ui toggle on a button $('#some_button').toggle(AnimateFormUp,AnimateFormDown) and i want to allow for that form to be draggable but only using that #some_button, so $('#form_contaning_some_button').draggable({handle: '#some_button'}); It doesn't work. As if the toggle prevents it from being draggable. If i remove the handle it allows the form to be dragged. Do
[10:08:27] <shoshy> i need to unbind something in toggle? or prevent something..
[10:09:31] <lucenut> So we have a form generation tool. It creates the form and the validation code based on the class="required" or whatever. But is there a way I can create some custom validation in another block of code AFTER that?
[10:09:41] <rickibalboa> Would there be an easy way of determining how many elements are between n1 and n2 in a scrollable div, say how many elements are between 100 and 550 pixels in this scrollable div, not all elements just first childs
[10:09:48] <LindsayMac> shoky:  just so i know for future reference.. does .stop() work on .css(  ) or only .animation
[10:10:03] <LindsayMac> I was reading up on the differences between .stop() and .clearqueue and .dequeue etc
[10:10:08] <shoky> LindsayMac: only on animations and other things that are queued
[10:10:11] <Brodingo> .css is synchronous...
[10:10:12] <b-ot> Brodingo, memorised “css”.
[10:10:17] <shoky> LindsayMac: not on .css , that is not asynchronous
[10:10:19] <Brodingo> ugh
[10:10:26] <Brodingo> b-ot: forget css
[10:10:26] <b-ot> Brodingo, I have forgotten “css”.
[10:10:28] <LindsayMac> ?
[10:11:13] <Brodingo> it happens immediately and there is no animation queue
[10:11:15] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/4406912 - right now this is creating an img tag - then an a tag
[10:11:28] <LindsayMac> ok i get it..
[10:11:32] <brettfrable> how can i get it to create <a><img /></a> in the markup
[10:11:41] <brettfrable> instead of <img /> <a></a>
[10:11:51] <niix> anyone here familiar with Fullcalendar?
[10:12:05] <IvanKuzev> $('<a>').append($("<img>"))
[10:12:32] <shoky> actually i was half wrong, .stop()is only for animations, not for any queued stuff, makes sense.
[10:13:09] <LindsayMac> I think i need to figure out more about how the queue works
[10:13:45] <shoky> depends what you wanna do
[10:13:56] <shoky> but .stop() on .css() doesn't make sense
[10:14:04] <brettfrable> that doesn't work
[10:14:31] <LindsayMac> yea.. i understand that..so in my learning, I am going to focus on how the queue works and where it works and how to clear it.
[10:14:39] <brettfrable> IvanKuzev
[10:14:48] <LindsayMac> i think i need to get chrome up and running to because from what I read, its got the best tools for jquery animations
[10:14:51] <IvanKuzev> yes?
[10:14:56] <brettfrable> that doesn't worjk
[10:15:14] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/4406934
[10:15:20] <brettfrable> is what i have
[10:15:28] <koja> hello all
[10:15:57] <shoky> brettfrable , you want the img to be draggable or the <a> to be draggable?
[10:16:04] <ezio> brettfrable,
[10:16:04] <brettfrable> the image
[10:16:05] <ezio> close
[10:16:09] <shoky> brettfrable: and you're missing parens
[10:16:40] <koja> i love jquery, and i start learning it
[10:17:01] <brettfrable> where am i missing parens
[10:17:10] <shoky> start counting
[10:17:18] <MattDunbar> 1
[10:17:19] <MattDunbar> 2
[10:17:19] <MattDunbar> 3
[10:17:23] <shoky> thank you
[10:17:24] <ezio> you're missing a bracket
[10:17:37] <brettfrable> full code here
[10:17:38] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/4406943
[10:17:51] <MattDunbar> lol, pastie.
[10:17:57] <shoky> still missing a paren
[10:17:58] <MattDunbar> pasties suck.
[10:18:01] <shoky> line 12.
[10:18:02] <ezio> brettfrable, yeah you're missing a bracket
[10:18:51] <ezio> you're missing the bracket that matches the second append
[10:21:35] <jwmann> Can I do a $("#foo").children().length() except skip any <h1> ?
[10:22:38] <shoky> jwmann: $('#foo').children(':not(h1)').length
[10:23:17] <Grundell> how do i add display none to every li except the first ?
[10:23:18] <Grundell> ?
[10:23:25] <jwmann> shoky: Awesome, is it possible to do (h{**ANY INTERGER**}) ?
[10:23:27] <Grundell> the li has a class
[10:23:42] <shoky> jwmann :not(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)
[10:23:51] <jwmann> shoky: haha okay thank you!
[10:24:40] <shoky> Grundell: $('li').slice(1).css('display','none')
[10:25:03] <Grundell> shoky - thanks
[10:25:48] <Grundell> Assume .slice(1) is not the class ?
[10:25:56] <shoky> ?
[10:26:18] <Grundell> shoky i only want to add it to one of my lists...
[10:26:24] <Grundell> not everyone of them
[10:26:36] <shoky> you said every li except the first
[10:26:46] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  you can do this with CSS
[10:28:06] <LindsayMac> but shoky 's explaintaion seems like it would work too..
[10:28:18] <Grundell> LindsayMac - yes i know but since i can't do that because of i have the list in a numerous pages, and there for i have to use a JS to do it on this specific page
[10:28:56] <digs> What is the best UI to use for hover over "tooltips" ?
[10:28:56] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  no.. remember I showed you the trick on how to use PHP to add a unique class to the body tag on each page?
[10:29:08] <Grundell> Yes, it works though it removes all my lists on the page i want it to remove the list with class name .trns-seq-item
[10:29:15] <LindsayMac> digs:  i found the bootstrap ones to be nice, simple, easy to implement and cleam
[10:29:19] <digs> Basically advanced better looking alt tags.
[10:29:28] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  then its because your CSS is wrong
[10:29:33] <digs> I will take a look at those LindsayMac
[10:30:02] <Grundell> LindsayMac - Yeah, the thing is that this is for like all post pages so it would be to much
[10:30:11] <LindsayMac> wrong again
[10:30:16] <Grundell> I am ?
[10:30:31] <LindsayMac> that php code i showed you allows you to set styles based on the specific page id, the page template, the page type, the category of the post.
[10:30:37] <LindsayMac> just about anything that defines what that page is
[10:30:54] <LindsayMac> So if it's only for posts, then you use .post
[10:31:24] <Grundell> LindsayMac i have specific page template single_lost-in-translation
[10:31:25] <LindsayMac> if it's only for pages that use the wp page template "one column" then you use .page-template-one-column
[10:31:34] <LindsayMac> read above Grundell
[10:31:43] <Grundell> LindsayMac just noticed :)
[10:31:45] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  just look at your source code! It's all there in your body tag now
[10:32:04] <tw2113> working on css specificity with body_class ?
[10:32:14] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  yea..
[10:32:29] <Grundell> LindsayMac - that is awesome
[10:32:38] <LindsayMac> he wants display:none; on the first item in a list only if on a specific page.. easy peasy with the code i gave Grundell the other day
[10:32:39] <Grundell> LindsayMac thanks again
[10:32:56] <tw2113> i think a lightbulb went off
[10:34:23] <LindsayMac> or on
[10:34:47] <Grundell> Haha don't be mean now :)
[10:35:06] <Grundell> Im learning at least, that has to count for something
[10:35:10] <LindsayMac> how was that mean?
[10:35:18] <LindsayMac> everyone starts somewhere.
[10:35:20] <Grundell> tw2113 :P
[10:36:02] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  just remember that when you want to do some specific styling only on one specific page, look towards the body class I gve you. You can go even further and add page specific classes to any element, but for now, stick with that
[10:36:17] <tw2113> i ridicule no one who's legitimately trying to learn
[10:36:21] <Grundell> I will thanks :)
[10:40:33] <LindsayMac> d'oh.. just did something almost really stupid
[10:40:41] <ezio> typical
[10:40:43] <Grundell> tw2113 - that's nice of you to say :)
[10:40:57] <tw2113> almost replied to me LindsayMac ?
[10:41:09] <Grundell> LindsayMac - tw2113 - haha
[10:41:20] <LindsayMac> muahahaha
[10:41:26] <LindsayMac> I've already opened that flood gatye
[10:42:04] <tw2113> you keep replying to me?
[10:42:08] <LindsayMac> yup
[10:42:36] <tw2113> i'd call that really stupid
[10:42:37] <LindsayMac> shoky:  using your code, I am getting an error e. is not defined. Does that mean I need to load that code in a different order?
[10:42:37] <tw2113> :D
[10:42:58] <Grundell> Have a pretty awesome quote on the subject - "If there are no stupid questions, what kind of questions do stupid people ask? do they get smart just in time to ask questions?"
[10:43:54] <LindsayMac> there are plenty of stupid questions
[10:43:59] <LindsayMac> i've asked my fair share
[10:44:26] <Grundell> LindsayMac - haha that's pretty much what it says :P
[10:44:46] <shoky> LindsayMac: the 'e' is the argument sent to the .click callback  ( .click(function(e) { ...
[10:44:47] <tw2113> i'd say there are no stupid questions, there are sometimes non-needed questions
[10:45:04] <Grundell> Btw. when i toggle the hidden li items by js now it hides the fist child
[10:45:11] <shoky> LindsayMac: so if you gave it a different name use that one, or add the 'e' if it'snot there in your code
[10:45:17] <Grundell> i assume i just put !important
[10:45:20] <Grundell> :P
[10:45:27] <Grundell> didn't think of that
[10:45:52] <Grundell> Nope didn't work...
[10:51:47] <niix> I'm using FullCalendar and trying to iterate over an array of events in the calendar, but it's not returning anything but "Object object" http://jsfiddle.net/hk9Xv/ can anyone help? I'm pretty new to js
[10:52:13] <Atty> Is there any good examples of using Fullcalendar with a modal dialog?
[11:04:39] <jwmann> I have a jQuery object with an entire divs content in it; eg: $(this) — How would I select every anchor inside this object?
[11:05:39] <zackiv31> $('a',$(this))
[11:06:36] <Teduardo> What is the easiest way to assign multiple properties to a dropdown <option> ?
[11:06:50] <digs> http://jquery.bassistance.de/tooltip/demo/ - I am completely baffeled... WHERE does the text live for these tooltips?
[11:07:01] <digs> Like the 4th one down with the yahoo links.
[11:07:15] <digs> Where is the text that shows up the tooltip?
[11:07:32] <jwmann> zackiv31: Thank you!, is there any documentation on that?
[11:08:25] <Teduardo> i.e. I'm trying to build a form that when you select an operating system it moves the sliders for minimum_ram and minimum_disk space to the minimums assigned on the 'option'
[11:09:11] <ShawnRisk> what does {"error": "Please use POST request"} when I try to use $(e.target).load('videourl'); and videourl = $(e.target).attr('href');?  I am trying to load a video link.
[11:09:16] <Teduardo> it might be easier to just expose the limits in json and then reference them
[11:09:17] <derekpioneer> working with jquery ui. i do $('#text_1').draggable() and the ui-draggable class is added to that div but it still does not respond to any drags. what could this be?
[11:09:29] <derekpioneer> it's some sort of binding problem i think
[11:10:14] <shoky> derekpioneer: what kind of element is it?
[11:10:21] <derekpioneer> shoky: a div
[11:10:29] <derekpioneer> i've dragged elements exactly like it before
[11:10:59] <shoky> then you know that your problem description isn't enough..
[11:11:41] <derekpioneer> yeah i know
[11:11:53] <derekpioneer> the full description would be too much though
[11:11:58] <derekpioneer> so i'm basicaly just screwed
[11:12:03] <shoky> reproduce the issue in a jsfiddle
[11:12:14] <derekpioneer> with like 2000+ lines of hard to follow javascript?
[11:12:14] <shoky> you can use this as template http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/15/
[11:12:17] <shoky> no
[11:12:26] <shoky> with the lines that cause the problem
[11:12:26] <derekpioneer> probably won't be able to reproduce it then
[11:12:33] <shoky> then you need to dig deeper
[11:12:39] <shoky> and find what is the cause
[11:15:01] <civixier> Hi people. Toying around with jquery ui. What's the best approach to get this to work with several icons and windows with the least amount of code? (The "icon" at the bottom is clickable) http://ui.civixier.com/
[11:15:37] <steveoh> so... i have an icon, that repeats in a table. when you click on the icon it changes from active to diabled. when you click on it also fires an ajax request. whats the best way to manage the click binding and swapping the url etc to make this work properly
[11:20:33] <Grundell> LindsayMac are you there
[11:20:44] <LindsayMac> I am
[11:20:45] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my question?
[11:21:25] <Grundell> LindseyMac - nice :) do you have a lot experiance with wp ? I cant seam to wrapp my head around a problem with comments
[11:22:08] <LindsayMac> I have a lot of experience with WP.. but you should ask in #wordpress not here
[11:22:21] <ShawnRisk> what does {"error": "Please use POST request"} when I try to use $(e.target).load('videourl'); and videourl = $(e.target).attr('href');?  I am trying to load a video link.
[11:22:42] <ezio> fuk wordpress
[11:22:52] <LindsayMac> ok
[11:22:56] <Grundell> LindsayMac - well i asked in #wordpress but didn't really get any one whom had the time to look at it...
[11:23:20] <LindsayMac> Grundell:  ask again.. that is the place to go to ask those questions. I can't help you in here with a WP question.
[11:23:42] <LindsayMac> I mean, i can help with little things, but not going to debug a comment issue in #juery and clog up the strea
[11:23:43] <LindsayMac> m
[11:24:03] <Grundell> LindsayMac - Will do then
[11:32:37] <Teduardo> really quick question; I have a select and a bunch of json data http://jsfiddle.net/3JQmm/, when I select one of the options in the select I would like to print some of the data in the json that correlates to the "id" on both the select and in the json; can anyone help me get started?
[11:33:49] <IvanKuzev> you can get the value of the select and use it as a key in the json
[11:34:46] <Teduardo> oh, right value, not id...
[11:34:52] <box> i can't understand why merging 4 external js files into one breaks the site. the contents isn't modified, it's only appended to one file
[11:35:25] <LindsayMac> box:  you probably broke a closing } or })
[11:35:38] <Teduardo> IvanKuzev: of course I have no idea how to do that, just trying to make a cool form
[11:35:42] <box> if i resplit the single file, the site works. i did this to confirm something wasn't changing i put them all together
[11:36:03] <box> LindsayMac: negative
[11:36:12] <LindsayMac> box:  what does "broken" mean?
[11:36:25] <Matt4321234> you're broken
[11:36:27] <box> let me restart my computer and i'll indulge you
[11:43:22] <cancan2623_> WHOIS help
[11:43:30] <cancan2623_> help
[11:44:59] <LindsayMac> ?
[11:49:32] <steveoh> how do you get the css classes on a dom node
[11:50:56] <ezio> you want to list the css classes on an element?
[11:51:16] <steveoh> yah
[11:51:18] <tcial> I have the following problem, and I don't know what's causing it
[11:51:27] <tcial> http://jsfiddle.net/MVsLp/
[11:51:52] <ezio> tcial, ah you did fix tha $(this)
[11:52:06] <tcial> ezio: Yeah, it was a <derp> on my behalf
[11:52:20] <ezio> k now what's your problem?
[11:52:25] <tcial> Take a look
[11:52:31] <tcial> the jsfiddle describes it
[11:52:37] <steveoh> ezio: suggestion?
[11:53:07] <ezio> steveoh, check to see if hasclass has a see also
[11:53:09] <steveoh> trying attr('class') doesn't work
[11:53:40] <steveoh> doesn't see a see also
[11:54:17] <steveoh> prop and attribute work
[11:54:19] <steveoh> attr
[11:54:44] <ezio> oh yeah attr should work
[11:54:53] <amh345> is there any way to send an alert/modal to a user if they try to close the browser?
[11:55:18] <tcial> ezio: Any idea what's causing it
[11:55:19] <amh345> i have a sequence of pages that most people handle ok. but a few close early and it screws some things up.  so i'd like to notify them
[11:55:21] <steveoh> whats the diff between attr and prop
[11:55:29] <ezio> tcial, lookking at it
[11:55:40] <tcial> amh345: Try this
[11:55:41] <tcial> amh345: http://api.jquery.com/unload/
[11:55:57] <tcial> amh345: $(window).unload( function () { alert("Bye now!"); } ); shows a message on close
[11:55:59] <amh345> tcial.  thanks.  ill give it a shot
[11:56:22] <amh345> i think i read that that will also trigger when a user hits "back", is this correct?
[11:56:41] <amh345> im testing it now. so ill know
[11:56:58] <tcial> amh345: "The forward and back buttons will trigger the event", quoted from the page
[11:57:01] <tcial> Yeah it will trigger it
[11:57:07] <keirlav87> how do I turn window.location.search into an object such as index.php?hello=world into obj = { hello : world } please anyone?
[11:57:22] <amh345> tcial, ok. well it will be better than nothing!
[11:57:24] <amh345> thank you
[11:57:27] <tcial> amh345: Anytime
[11:58:35] <ezio> tcial, http://jsfiddle.net/MVsLp/
[11:59:07] <tcial> ezio: Yes, what about it?
[11:59:39] <MistuhKurtz> some browers notify you if you leave the page with a form filled out & no submission, amh345. idk if that helps
[11:59:47] <ezio> tcial, http://jsfiddle.net/ezio/MVsLp/1/
[12:00:06] <tcial> ezio: It still does it
[12:00:20] <tcial> When you move the mouse off a button you have already pressed twice, it vanishes
[12:00:27] <xckpd7> question: so I'm increasing the margin of an element at the bottom of the page.. and I want the page to scroll down to accomodate for the new height of the document.
[12:01:49] <steveoh> are the ajax done and always function ordering guaranteed
[12:02:30] <LindsayMac> Ahhh fiddle works, website doesnt
[12:03:08] <amh345> odd. $(window).unload( function () { alert("Bye now!"); } );  doesnt trigger when i close the browser.  but $(window).load( function () { alert("Bye now!"); } ) will trigger when the page is hit.
[12:03:30] <tcial> amh345: I read that some browsers don't support it o_o
[12:03:44] <amh345> im betting chrome is on of them.  hah
[12:03:46] <amh345> ill check
[12:03:55] <Matt4321234_> smart browsers dont support it
[12:04:02] <Matt4321234> its really damn annoying
[12:04:04] <ezio> tcial, http://jsfiddle.net/ezio/MVsLp/2/
[12:04:09] <ezio> so far
[12:04:23] <amh345> Matt4321234: do you have a solution for smart browsers?
[12:04:29] <Matt4321234> dont do it
[12:04:34] <Matt4321234> alerting on unload is so bad
[12:04:37] <Matt4321234> frustrating.
[12:04:42] <tcial> ezio: I just need it to hide when they click it a second time, like a toggle
[12:04:49] <amh345> i know. but trust me. the end result for the user is more frustrating.
[12:04:59] <amh345> if they close and dont know they shouldnt
[12:05:22] <Matt4321234> take a look at exitsplash
[12:05:26] <tcial> amh345: I'm sure it's possible, lots of website I've used do it
[12:05:31] <tcial> webchat.freenode.net does it
[12:05:40] <Matt4321234> should be able to steal the code somehow, its pretty cross browser
[12:05:56] <amh345> k. thanks again guys
[12:07:03] <ezio> just go to facebook, type in half a comment, close the tab, then search the scripts for the verbiage they use
[12:08:35] <MistuhKurtz> amh345, sounds like a design problem tbh
[12:08:51] <ezio> tcial, i think you have to target just one
[12:08:59] <ezio> for the hide function
[12:09:02] <Ben_______> Hey Guys - Quick question: Can you use jQuery to select elements from another jQuery object (rather than targeting the DOM)?
[12:09:02] <tcial>  $("a[rel=popover]").popover("hide");
[12:09:05] <tcial> That one?
[12:09:08] <ezio> iyup
[12:09:14] <tcial> ezio: How do I do it then?
[12:09:21] <MistuhKurtz> Pretty sure that the alert for leaving a web page works automatically when a form has been filled out and hasn't been submitted
[12:09:23] <amh345> MistuhKurtz: that's what some people say.  design problem.  however there are instances where the design calls for it and it must be used.
[12:09:28] <ezio> ummm ... each
[12:09:40] <ezio> is there a method to tell if popover is applied?
[12:09:42] <amh345> it's not actually for a form.
[12:09:43] <tcial> ezio: They all have the same ID and class though, I can't individually adress each one
[12:09:52] <tcial> ezio: I don't know, to be honest
[12:09:56] <ezio> well they shouldn't have the same id
[12:10:03] <tcial> ezio: They don't have an ID xD
[12:10:15] <amh345> the user selects various options on pages.    but if they dont go to the end. the dont see the final result and get confused.
[12:10:20] <ezio> hold on i'll do a test case
[12:10:25] <tcial> ezio: Ok, thanks :£
[12:10:30] <tcial> *:)
[12:10:45] <MistuhKurtz> amh345, I can't say for certain without seeing the page, but if users are exiting and unintentionally leaving the process unfinished, sounds like a big design problem to me. If further action is needed, obvious visual cues should be used.
[12:11:57] <amh345> MistuhKurtz: people ignore the cues.  not everyone.  but a minority. enough for it to cause a headache. and money.
[12:12:17] <MistuhKurtz> can the additional action be incorporated in the previous page then?
[12:13:17] <MistuhKurtz> amh345, you could add the alert for links on your page...but something like closing a browser, I don't think you can (or really should) touch it
[12:13:27] <amh345> not really.  because the previous action determines the next action.   and even if i was to cram everything on a single page. i would still face the closing browser problem
[12:13:32] <ezio> tcial, http://jsfiddle.net/ezio/MVsLp/8/
[12:13:57] <tcial> ezio: It still does it :(
[12:14:18] <ezio> umm
[12:14:20] <ezio> no it doesn't
[12:14:43] <tcial> ezio: Keep clicking one of the buttons
[12:14:53] <tcial> ezio: It messes up and becomes a hover one]
[12:15:04] <ezio> yes it still has some issue but the big one is fixed ...
[12:15:07] <ezio> lemme see
[12:15:32] <tcial> Click a button a few times, then when the popover is shown, move your mouse off the button
[12:16:54] <ezio> tcial, it's just a logic error
[12:16:55] <ezio> simple
[12:18:06] <ezio> how do you debug in jsfiddle
[12:18:35] <tcial> ezio: You mean Javascript Console? Just open your browser's
[12:18:49] <ezio> no where is the script i'm debugging
[12:19:21] <ezio> nm found it
[12:23:32] <ezio> tcial, http://jsfiddle.net/ezio/MVsLp/14/
[12:24:08] <tcial> ezio: Has anyone ever told you you're amazing?
[12:24:15] <ezio> regularly
[12:24:29] <tcial> :)
[12:24:35] <tcial> It's true
[12:27:47] <ezio> tcial, http://jsfiddle.net/ezio/MVsLp/16/
[12:27:58] <ezio> you should do that so they know they can unset the dialog
[12:28:15] <tcial> Wow, thanks
[12:28:16] <tcial> :)
[12:28:20] <tcial> It looks nice :D
[12:28:35] <ezio> actually that just made me realize
[12:28:40] <ezio> here's a more simplified version ...
[12:33:33] <tcial> ezio: How is it possible to simplify it?
[12:33:55] <ezio> tcial, generally not a good idea to have globals
[12:34:04] <tcial> ezio: Why not?
[12:34:22] <ezio> the pollute the program and the allocate memory on the heap
[12:34:24] <ezio> not on the stack
[12:34:30] <tcial> ezio: Ah, so how can I fix it?
[12:34:42] <ezio> working on it
[12:35:25] <tcial> ezio: Thanks for this :3
[12:39:13] <amh345> so i've found some exitsplash code.   but the guy who wrote it didnt have text formatting set properly.  i believe i've fixed it now. but i cannot get it to trigger. can anyone see what's wrong with it? http://jsfiddle.net/L2aHR/
[12:40:48] <ezio> tcial, http://jsfiddle.net/ezio/MVsLp/25/
[12:40:54] <tcial> Wow, 25 o_o
[12:41:20] <sshaun> is there any kind of selector that lets me iterate over groups of 3 elements at a time?, foreach group -> foreach element in group
[12:49:08] <ezio> sshaun, use a for loop
[12:49:21] <ezio> for (var x = 0; x < 100; ++x)
[12:49:40] <ezio> {myarr[a++]; myarr[a++];
[12:50:48] <ezio> oops
[12:50:50] <ezio> x++
[12:51:11] <ezio> the order of incrementation maters
[12:55:19] <someprimetime> how can i bind two cached variables to one click event?
[12:55:49] <someprimetime> e.g. var $blah = $('#foo'); var $blah2 = $('#bar');
[12:56:26] <sshaun> $blad.add($blah2).click(handle)
[12:56:33] <someprimetime> ahh .add()
[12:56:34] <someprimetime> thanks
[12:59:43] <ezio> someprimetime, you don' thave to call blah $blah
[13:00:00] <someprimetime> i prefix all DOM elements with $
[13:00:10] <ezio> ah ok
[13:00:14] <someprimetime> and all plain js variables (numbers, strings, etc) without them
[13:00:18] <someprimetime> just personal preference
[13:00:34] <someprimetime> but +1
[13:01:26] <steveoh> is there a more optimal way to do https://gist.github.com/61cf63811ed655e1258d
[13:02:01] <ezio> to do what
[13:02:19] <steveoh> i thought the code was pretty self explanitory
[13:02:25] <steveoh> i can describe it but...
[13:02:43] <steveoh> would you like me to?
[13:02:44] <ezio> yes but that would take time
[13:02:53] <ezio> yes i would like you to
[13:02:58] <ezio> and what you want to be optimized
[13:03:09] <steveoh> more so LOC
[13:03:26] <ezio> loc?
[13:03:40] <steveoh> so there's a table of items and they have an icon that displays depending on the state
[13:03:42] <steveoh> lines of code
[13:04:01] <steveoh> so for all icon-play and icon-pause i add a click event
[13:04:10] <steveoh> then i determine which one it is on line 2
[13:04:23] <steveoh> so i can figure out what url to make the ajax request
[13:04:39] <steveoh> before i send the request i change the icon to a time icon to display activity
[13:04:52] <steveoh> then when it's doen i swap the icons and change some text in the table row
[13:05:09] <steveoh> and i do the opposite depending on the state of the link node when it was clicked
[13:05:28] <steveoh> clear as mud? probably quicker to read the code
[13:06:20] <ezio> $(e.target).removeClass("icon-time").addClass((cssClassState === 'icon-pause' ? 'icon-play':'icon-paus').attr('title', 'Start Key');
[13:06:45] <ezio> $(e.target).removeClass("icon-time").addClass((cssClassState === 'icon-pause' ? 'icon-play':'icon-paus').attr('title', cssClassState === 'icon-pause' ? ''Start Key': );
[13:06:49] <ezio> grr
[13:07:00] <steveoh> i was looking at toggle(
[13:07:02] <ezio> you can see what you have to do to finish it
[13:07:29] <ezio> oh yes i thought you were getting shit from the data
[13:07:44] <steveoh> huh
[13:08:04] <steveoh> how do you aggregate toggle over all the nodes?
[13:08:20] <ezio> you select nodes that are off
[13:08:29] <ezio> then select nodes that are on
[13:08:41] <steveoh> but this is creating the click handler
[13:08:47] <steveoh> do i remove the on and replace that with toggle
[13:09:27] <steveoh> toggle would make this even less DRY also
[13:09:36] <steveoh> the way i see it
[13:09:58] <ezio> this code is terrible
[13:10:30] <ezio> there's a lot of things you could do better, but i'm not bothering unless you have a test case
[13:11:51] <steveoh> ok i'll make a quick fiddle
[13:14:04] <ezio> i'm going to have to leave soon
[13:15:26] <dogarrhea2> why are they called cookies?
[13:15:40] <steveoh> ezio, how do you mock ajax in jsfiddle off hand
[13:15:47] <steveoh> nm
[13:16:14] <LindsayMac> So i am stuck again. I am have this smooth scrolling script that is basically triggering a series of animations when an element is at an offset()top position. That all works fine, but when I try to add the ability to disable clicks until after the animation is done, it gets all screwy.
[13:16:22] <steveoh> ezio: http://jsfiddle.net/QEfYa/
[13:16:37] <steveoh> click the pause icon
[13:17:49] <LindsayMac> What is even more strange is that it works on a fiddle but not my site
[13:20:03] <Eliazer> is there a post render callback for Angular JS directive?
[13:20:22] <steveoh> ezio: did you see the fiddle or did you leave already
[13:20:57] <ezio> steveoh you can use the terney expressions i showed you above but i really redesign it ...
[13:20:58] <ezio> also
[13:21:01] <LindsayMac> here's my code if anyone can have a look.. although to see the error/issue you'd have to look at my site, which I can give access to with an IP http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/60/
[13:21:11] <ezio> just set a variable for var playing
[13:21:20] <LindsayMac> OOps ignore that last code
[13:21:28] <ezio> var playing = cssClassState === 'icon-play'
[13:21:31] <ezio> ;
[13:21:37] <steveoh> how would you redesign it
[13:21:48] <Eliazer> sorry i don't mean to spam, but does someone see this message (i want to know if i am connected)
[13:22:01] <steveoh> yeah we see you
[13:22:06] <Eliazer> tx!
[13:22:12] <ezio> i might ... and only if you have multiple states for that button
[13:22:18] <ezio> which you do have 3
[13:23:21] <ezio> var button_states = ['icon-play':{url: ..., title: , class
[13:23:30] <steveoh> ezio, the play and pause buttons can be mixed on the initial load
[13:23:32] <ezio> image
[13:23:43] <ezio> oh no you wn't need image
[13:23:58] <ezio> i would create a state array
[13:25:02] <steveoh> k well i'm not too worrieda bout it then... that seems over kill
[13:25:35] <steveoh> i dont' want to have to manage a state [] and then update the ui from the state []
[13:28:06] <ezio> yes if this is the depth of all you need to do with that play button
[13:28:56] <ezio> you're okay ... i would  make this conscession too... i'd still use tearney operators to make it look more sensical, but speed of coding comes before speed of code
[13:32:11] <shoky> steveoh: to add to what ezio is saying, here's an example http://pastebin.com/jC6ZqVAB
[13:32:27] <shoky> (i might've mixed up the order in the ternaries)
[13:32:30] <ezio> http://jsfiddle.net/ezio/QEfYa/2/
[13:32:48] <ezio> lol me too
[13:32:55] <shoky> ;P
[13:33:02] * shoky hi5 ezio
[13:33:20] * ezio highfives and we both hit eacother in the face
[13:33:39] <shoky> to the death
[13:33:45] <shoky> hiyoooo
[13:33:57] * shoky dies
[13:34:24] * ezio stands triumphantly over shoky's lifeless body
[13:36:56] <Gho5t> why  isn't this sorting alphabetically: users.sort(function(a, b){ return a.name > b.name;	});
[13:39:35] <LessSeen> Gho5t: maybe cast them both to lowercase before comparing them?
[13:42:21] <ak> hi
[13:47:11] <ezio> everyone gets to play
[13:47:13] <ezio> run away
[13:47:15] <ezio> expose
[13:47:18] <ezio> it was so exotic
[13:47:24] <ezio> but just one pogo stick
[13:50:46] <Gho5t> do you guys use single or double quotes in js
[13:50:55] <ryanneufeld> Gho5t: yes
[13:51:02] <Gho5t> you make the distinction aye
[13:51:03] <ryanneufeld> Gho5t: it depends on what you're trying to do
[13:51:04] <ak> mostly single
[13:51:10] <Gho5t> i find myself using mostly single
[13:51:17] <ryanneufeld> Gho5t: but typically single
[13:51:21] <Gho5t> but every once in a while someone calls me out on it
[13:51:26] <Gho5t> and says double are for strings
[13:51:30] <Gho5t> and i have no argument
[13:51:33] <Gho5t> other than i'm lazy
[13:51:51] <ryanneufeld> does your code break when you don't?
[13:52:13] <Gho5t> nope
[13:52:14] <ryanneufeld> does it make your code un-readable, or cause unexpected behaviour?
[13:52:21] <Gho5t> negatory
[13:52:27] <ryanneufeld> Then you're probably fine
[13:52:44] <ryanneufeld> I know in PHP it really matters, but I can't recall in js if it does
[13:52:52] <Gho5t> it doesn't
[13:53:02] <ak> i think your argument should be google: js single vs double quotes ;)
[13:53:41] <ryanneufeld> ?g js single vs double quotes
[13:53:41] <b-ot> ryanneufeld, When to Use Double or Single Quotes in JavaScript - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/242813/when-to-use-double-or-single-quotes-in-javascript
[13:56:04] <Gho5t> i like this google thing
[13:56:08] <Gho5t> reminds me of bing
[14:00:29] <LindsayMac> I am getting this error: Tyle error: Targ is undefined -- and from what I would assume, it's because I'm loading my script in the wrong order, but I can't seem to figure out the right way..
[14:03:38] <LindsayMac> The code i am working with is wrapped in a document.ready and is being called AFTER jquery.js
[14:04:57] <LindsayMac> I am completely and utterly lost here
[14:06:13] <LindsayMac> This is the code in question https://gist.github.com/3c5444eb5ca729484f0d
[14:07:25] <LindsayMac> Here is a fiddle replicating my error http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/vaTWq/
[14:07:41] <LindsayMac> The goal with that initialization code is to get it to finish the animation before moving on to the next.
[14:10:52] <Toerkeium> guys, I'm developing an autocomplete with jquery. Is there any way to make the ajax requests to be executed in order? if I trigger an ajax function when I press a key, if I press 3 times, sometimes the first key-press executes after the last 2
[14:11:20] <Toerkeium> or maybe to cancell previous ajax calls if one more is present
[14:11:29] <Jayflux> is it possible to change the validity of an input element from true to false via jQuery
[14:12:22] <Toerkeium> Jayflux: what do you mean by validity?
[14:12:32] <Jayflux> Toerkeium this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/ValidityState
[14:12:43] <Jayflux> the validity.valid property of an input element
[14:12:50] <Jayflux> im struggling to change it manually.
[14:13:13] <Jayflux> the valid property in that
[14:15:44] <Toerkeium> have you tried $("#input").validity() ?
[14:16:13] <ktstowell> LindsayMac:  I am getting 'can't read property 'left' of undefined' So I am guessing that your scrollTo object isn't being found in the DOM
[14:16:30] <Toerkeium> I think there is a plugin for that
[14:17:05] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  if you have a look at the comments though, you can see that the scroll works just fine without the additional code to check for animations and such
[14:17:26] <ktstowell> Sorry - should've elaborated - only thrown on <a> click
[14:17:29] <ktstowell> not scroll
[14:18:55] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  yea. the error is only occuring when you click on the link... but the thing is that the same object is being called in similar code and it's found
[14:19:42] <ktstowell> kk
[14:20:07] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  if you look at the commented code directly below, you can test and uncomment that and use that and see that it works, to an extent
[14:20:53] <ktstowell> Yarp
[14:21:40] <LindsayMac> SO i am stuck..
[14:21:52] <ktstowell> Well I fixed yer link problem.
[14:22:01] <LindsayMac> really i've decided that it might be best to just prevent the ability to click any links while in progress..
[14:22:16] <LindsayMac> which I tried e.preventDefault .. I can pull up that code, but i couldnt get it to work
[14:23:26] <ktstowell> usually a good idea if granular control is necessary
[14:23:53] <LindsayMac> yea.. i see no need to let them get all click happy
[14:24:28] <ktstowell> people are click happy be default
[14:24:41] <ktstowell> by*
[14:25:04] <LindsayMac> haha yea.. especially the dude trying everything he can to break the site for fun.. just to show me that it sucks
[14:25:06] <LindsayMac> But yea..
[14:25:08] <ktstowell> it's planning for that behavior that makes web dev difficult
[14:25:15] <ktstowell> lawl
[14:25:28] <ktstowell> we have a team for that at my work
[14:25:36] <ktstowell> They like to call themselves QA
[14:25:39] <ktstowell> but really
[14:25:45] <ktstowell> they are sadist bastards
[14:25:48] <Nachtwind> hi, i have a question.. i listen for clicks on different <a>s doing "$("a.cancela").live("click", function(){..." - how do i read out the name or id within that function?
[14:26:16] <ktstowell> $(this).attr('id')
[14:26:26] <Nachtwind> ahh, thanks
[14:26:26] <ktstowell> will give you the id of the element that was most recently clicked
[14:27:56] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  that is my husband.. haha
[14:28:03] <ktstowell> lol
[14:28:28] <LindsayMac> i give any site to him, and he can break it..
[14:28:42] <Nachtwind> ktstowell: works like a charm, thanks!
[14:28:42] <ktstowell> they secretly thrive on telling you your code sucks while not being able to do a better job of writing it
[14:28:44] <ktstowell> love it.
[14:28:49] <LindsayMac> hahah YES!
[14:28:50] <LindsayMac> OMG
[14:29:04] <ktstowell> np Nachtwind, anytime.
[14:29:13] <ktstowell> I'll take questions like that all day long.
[14:30:49] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  if i were to set a flag.. like "animating" and did if(animated) { e.preventDefault(); return;
[14:31:08] <ktstowell> you could do that, yarp
[14:31:08] <LindsayMac> where do i define animated = true?
[14:31:20] <ktstowell> right before you animate
[14:31:26] <ktstowell> then in your animate callback
[14:31:28] <ktstowell> set it to false
[14:31:41] <ktstowell> the problem is
[14:31:49] <ktstowell> you'll have to get tight with your closures
[14:31:54] <LindsayMac> ?
[14:31:55] <ktstowell> to isolate your animation loop
[14:32:01] <ktstowell> cloooosure
[14:32:12] <LindsayMac> ahh.. well the issue is I dont think I have a typical callback.. I have an If statement
[14:32:23] <ktstowell> $.animate come with one
[14:32:25] <ktstowell> comes
[14:32:37] <ktstowell> rememeeeber?
[14:32:40] <LindsayMac> i'm using .css
[14:32:43] <ktstowell> from yestardays
[14:32:45] <ktstowell> well!
[14:32:49] <LindsayMac> well AND .animate..
[14:32:49] <ktstowell> that's no animation!
[14:33:00] <LindsayMac> Sorry.. I'm using both..
[14:33:03] <ktstowell> hehehe
[14:33:06] <LindsayMac> there's three things that happen..
[14:33:06] <ktstowell> sec
[14:33:11] <LindsayMac> 1) smooth scroll to hash
[14:33:30] <LindsayMac> 2) .animate ({ height: $windowHeight }
[14:33:43] <LindsayMac> 3. .css(visibility ; 'visibible')
[14:34:00] <ktstowell> kk sec
[14:34:01] <LindsayMac> then when you go away, it does it in reverse..
[14:34:02] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  k
[14:34:30] <ktstowell> THIS
[14:34:31] <ktstowell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2190850/javascript-create-custom-callback
[14:34:37] <ktstowell> (look at the top answer)
[14:34:42] <LindsayMac> kk... reading
[14:34:59] <ktstowell> is a basic example of creating a callback in js
[14:35:49] <ktstowell> it is a far under-used and probably less understood pattern that can bring with it finite control of chronological execution
[14:35:54] <ktstowell> embrace it.
[14:35:55] <ktstowell> also
[14:35:57] <LindsayMac> yea i thought i understood callbacks, but apparently i only understood a part of them
[14:36:00] <ktstowell> know as promises
[14:36:03] <ktstowell> or deferreds
[14:36:13] <LindsayMac> yes. I was trying .promise()
[14:36:15] <ktstowell> jQuery now has the $deferred object
[14:36:27] <LindsayMac> which you can see in the original code.. but THAT was the code that was tossing the error
[14:36:40] <ktstowell> prolly running into a race condition
[14:36:50] <LindsayMac> what's THAT
[14:36:51] <ktstowell> which i uber common when constructing callbacks
[14:37:00] <LindsayMac> i'm always running in to race conditions...
[14:37:12] <ktstowell> hehe
[14:37:13] <LindsayMac> race condition is an infinate loop?
[14:37:19] <ktstowell> no
[14:37:37] <ktstowell> it's where you are trying to access part of your code before it gets defined
[14:37:46] <ktstowell> wether by internet/hardware delays
[14:37:47] <ktstowell> or
[14:37:54] <ktstowell> by executiong timing
[14:37:56] <ktstowell> erm
[14:37:59] <LindsayMac> ahh ok. Yea that is what I figured it was..
[14:38:10] <ktstowell> erps, brb
[14:38:21] <LindsayMac> but could not figure out where it was happening because everything SEEMINGLY was called.
[14:38:23] <LindsayMac> k
[14:42:33] <dogarrhea2> so
[14:42:53] <dogarrhea2> basically at every "enterprise" shop i've been in, they have used eval javascript everywhere for anything
[14:43:04] <ktstowell> ugh
[14:43:05] <dogarrhea2> if it's so bad, why is everyone using it
[14:43:09] <ktstowell> that hurts meh
[14:43:18] <ktstowell> business
[14:43:27] <ktstowell> business is the number one destroyer of code
[14:43:34] <dogarrhea2> i can actually see why they need eval for cross domain stuff where they are basically trying to hack the browser
[14:43:34] <imsky> lol right
[14:43:42] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: chances are someone decided that it was the way to go, and corporate doesn't want to change it
[14:44:04] <ryanneufeld> or they don't want to depend on a third party library
[14:45:12] <dogarrhea2> hrm in my case it's used like this eval(loadFile("somejavascriptfile.js"));
[14:45:26] <ryanneufeld> ew
[14:46:37] <ryanneufeld> http://apollokidz.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/oh-thats-nasty...jpeg
[14:47:32] <MistuhKurtz> that's a bit ugly indeed
[14:47:35] <dogarrhea2> what is it actually doing this loadFile function?
[14:47:50] <MistuhKurtz> you know you can load a JS file for execution...without eval
[14:47:53] <ryanneufeld> ?mdn loadFile
[14:48:53] <dogarrhea2> hrm google returns not so useful results
[14:49:31] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: it's probably a custom function
[14:49:36] <ryanneufeld> not a native JS function
[14:49:43] <dogarrhea2> prolly
[14:50:29] <dogarrhea2> how does that even work with eval
[14:50:40] <dogarrhea2> i thought you must have escaped everything in eval surrounded by double quotes
[14:50:52] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: loadFile is function
[14:50:58] <ryanneufeld> that likely returns a string
[14:51:05] <ryanneufeld> which is what eval is expecting
[14:51:50] <dogarrhea2> ok that makes sense now.
[14:52:04] <dogarrhea2> btw, this eval thing is used in some unit testing thing is it still appropriate in this case?
[14:52:14] <imsky> eval is used everywhere
[14:52:17] <imsky> dont let them fool you
[14:52:40] <dogarrhea2> didn't that douglas crawfish guy say "only use eval for json"
[14:52:55] <ryanneufeld> crockford
[14:52:59] <imsky> do you do everything a crawfish tells you?
[14:53:14] <dogarrhea2> yes :( i mourn for my dead pet crawfish from 3rd grade
[14:53:16] <ryanneufeld> and his opinions are often seen as harsh, and black/white
[14:53:30] <imsky> thx for the historical exposition ryan
[14:53:44] <dogarrhea2> so it's ok to use js eval for everything?
[14:53:44] <ryanneufeld> many people would suggest that he jam them up his craw
[14:53:47] <dogarrhea2> even curing aids
[14:53:57] <imsky> yes of course
[14:54:00] <ryanneufeld> if you can cure aids with an eval, then do it
[14:54:19] <ryanneufeld> but I'll break knuckles of my co-workers if they write js with evals
[14:54:22] <ryanneufeld> and vise versa
[14:54:26] <ryanneufeld> :P
[14:54:35] <ryanneufeld> but now that I see there is some slight trolling here....
[14:54:40] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna go be productive lol
[14:54:51] <dogarrhea2> my coworker is former military green beret. i don't think he is attackable
[14:54:51] <imsky> wit = trolling lol
[14:55:01] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  so do you think my best way to deal with that little issue is with the callback?
[14:55:26] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: then you poison his ass!
[14:55:27] <ktstowell> if you need finite control over execution timing, then yes
[14:56:11] <ktstowell> now afk, phone interview in 5 mins, wish me luck!
[14:56:23] <imsky> break a leg!
[14:56:37] <imsky> finish the interview nursing a broken leg that is
[14:56:50] <ktstowell> ill break THEIR legs!
[14:56:55] <imsky> over the phone?
[14:57:02] <ktstowell> yes
[14:57:35] <chilversc> imsky: broken leg? that's a harsh interview
[14:57:45] <dogarrhea2> like the x-files guy who gives someone a heart attack over the phone
[15:00:27] <imsky> they know wut is wut but they dont know wat is wat
[15:01:58] <dogarrhea2> cookie created in cross domain mode are all created without expiration date which means they are created as session cookies. This need to be fixed <---- jira ticket created a while back and assigned to me.  Description is: Cookie created in XD mode are all created without expiration date which means they are created as session cookies. This need to be fixed according to Oscar the Grouch.
[15:02:36] <dogarrhea2> so uh. how do i be diplomatic about this ticket?
[15:02:59] <dogarrhea2> it has something to do with setting cookies in javascript, this much i get heh. but the actual issue?
[15:03:54] <lindsayo> Hello again kind jQueryers.
[15:04:19] <lindsayo> I'm using http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide#options and wondering if the docs are wrong?
[15:04:24] <imsky> no they are not
[15:04:35] <lindsayo> it seems to imply that the number at the end is a distance
[15:04:40] <lindsayo> but it seems to be a speed?
[15:04:40] <imsky> nope
[15:04:42] <imsky> duration
[15:05:00] <lindsayo> so that's not in the Arguments section of the doc?
[15:05:06] <imsky> wat
[15:05:06] <b-ot> Now when everybody and their mama use yours
[15:05:10] <lindsayo> It's very confusing.
[15:05:15] <imsky> ur confusing
[15:05:34] <wroathe> Ok... Stupid question... When you use the jQuery constructor to select some elements in console the return value looks like [<a href=""></a>, <a href=""></a>] but it's an instance of jQuery. How can you have it be an instance of jQuery and look like an array at the same time?
[15:06:03] <wroathe> If I make a constructor that looks like function Time() {} and do var a = new Time() then a will return an object labeled as "Time"
[15:10:59] <imsky> wroathe, http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=init
[15:15:16] <lindsayo> I can't seem to register on jquery.com, I wonder if their reg system is still down after the site updates they made.
[15:15:21] <dogarrhea2> ok, reading more about this eval stuff
[15:15:47] <dogarrhea2> so it doesn't matter where you use eval as long as code injection doesn't inject aids into your eval
[15:16:16] <dogarrhea2> and this 20x slower than not using eval doesn't seem like a big deal at all
[15:16:19] <lindsayo> Does anyone know, have they disabled registration?
[15:16:23] <tw2113> register for what lindsayo ?
[15:16:31] <lindsayo> docs.jquery.com
[15:16:37] <lindsayo> I want to report/comment on this documentation omission.
[15:16:42] <tw2113> ah
[15:16:56] <tw2113> never tried myself :D
[15:17:18] <imsky> lindsayo why? just look up .hide() in docs and you'll get the parameter
[15:17:19] <lindsayo> heh, I don't feel so lame then. :)
[15:17:51] <lindsayo> imsky, because if a docs page is wrong, it's good for everyone to get it fixed.
[15:18:01] <imsky> kk fight the good fight
[15:18:14] <lindsayo> I guess I don't think of it as a fight. It's open source. :)
[15:20:26] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  is here!
[15:21:38] <tw2113> eww gross
[15:22:06] <lindsayo> heh
[15:22:18] <LindsayMac> ewwww yurself
[15:22:27] <Lavitz> hi
[15:22:31] <imsky> hey
[15:22:48] * dogarrhea2 pours a bucket of himself on lindsaymac
[15:22:55] <LindsayMac> ew
[15:22:58] <imsky> i always wondered
[15:23:01] <imsky> what dogarrhea is
[15:23:08] <Lavitz> I am testing some a slide  javascript I just made but its not working out
[15:23:18] <Lavitz> My images don't display
[15:23:27] <imsky> sounds like a problem
[15:23:30] <Lavitz> C:\Users\Goldie\Desktop\MainSite\my_images\
[15:23:37] <Lavitz> would that be a + image name?
[15:23:38] * imsky checks out
[15:24:05] <dogarrhea2> keke that backslash looks like a problem
[15:24:16] <lindsayo> Lavitz: you didn't include an actual filename in there.
[15:24:19] <lindsayo> I only see a path.
[15:24:39] <dogarrhea2> that too
[15:25:09] <Lavitz> imageArray[imageNum++] = new imageItem(imageDir + "01.jpg");  and my imageDir is as follows :
[15:25:22] <Lavitz>   var imageDir = "C:\Users\Goldie\Desktop\MainSite\my_images\";
[15:25:39] <dogarrhea2> imsky: dogarrhea is what i call my sister. and i called her that in front of her coworkers at Google. So it is also what my sister's coworkers call her
[15:25:52] <imsky> but why are you dogarrhea
[15:25:57] <imsky> shouldn't SHE be dogarrhea
[15:26:14] <LindsayMac> lemme pick up that name.. i think you dropped it
[15:26:18] <Lavitz> any idea or should pastebin the whole code?
[15:26:32] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  or jsfiddle.net
[15:27:01] <dogarrhea2> oh. i was just having trouble picking an irc name and gonorrhea was already registered
[15:27:13] <imsky> why
[15:27:15] <imsky> would you
[15:27:18] <imsky> gonorrhea
[15:27:39] <Lavitz> http://pastebin.com/6N1yfx08
[15:27:41] <Lavitz> there it is
[15:27:46] <dogarrhea2> seems weird. wouldn't not setting an expiration date on a cookie seem like the cookie never expires?
[15:28:39] <dogarrhea2> imsky, gonorrhea is the name of a friend in high school.
[15:29:31] <cf_PhillipSenn> I want to reward my users with some glitz after they've finished their online quiz.  Some sort of animation or game (like snakes).
[15:29:46] <LindsayMac> wonderful..
[15:30:15] <lindsayo> cf_PhillipSenn: awesome
[15:30:16] <lindsayo> lol
[15:30:18] <cf_PhillipSenn> Something lke "Yeah!  You did it!  Now play snakes until everyone else is finished"
[15:30:22] <dogarrhea2> jewish_johnson is the name of a coworker who programs javascript, feces is the name of my former roommate, Big_tits is the name of a girl in middle school who hit puberty early who was my singles partner etc. etc. etc.
[15:30:28] <lindsayo> that would be fun
[15:31:13] <lindsayo> So LindsayMac, I finally got my slide effect working on my Drupal site. I had to figure out how to make Drupal include the UI libraries I needed.
[15:31:15] <cf_PhillipSenn> Or missile command
[15:31:36] <cf_PhillipSenn> Or Defender
[15:31:40] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  Ahhh yea.. Thats what those errors seemed like. Thats good!
[15:31:58] <cf_PhillipSenn> Omega Race
[15:31:59] <lindsayo> Thanks for giving me the heads-up on that. It sent me in the right direction looking for the libraries.
[15:32:09] <LindsayMac> np
[15:32:34] <Lavitz> anyidea ? I should i paste the tutorial i followed. I literrally just copy pasted
[15:32:48] <lindsayo> Lavitz: please don't paste it in here.
[15:32:55] <lindsayo> pastebin would be good
[15:33:06] <Lavitz> i did paste bin already
[15:33:13] <lindsayo> oh, sorry I missed that.
[15:33:22] <Lavitz> http://pastebin.com/6N1yfx08
[15:35:16] <Lavitz> any idea?
[15:35:30] <imsky> i have an idea
[15:36:03] <Lavitz> would love to hear it if helps me resolve my issue :D
[15:37:31] <imsky> oh i just have many ideas
[15:37:34] <Lavitz> should zip the code and upload it ?
[15:38:19] <Lavitz> are you trolling me
[15:39:01] <nicovalencia> Lavitz: "\" !== "/"
[15:39:27] <Lavitz> kk let me change it up lol
[15:39:56] <Lavitz> "C:/Users/Goldie/Desktop/MainSite/"; so like htat?
[15:40:38] <nicovalencia> How are you serving the code? It would be best to path your images relative to your scripts or relative to the root of your application server.
[15:42:18] <Lavitz> this is the first time im doing this, litterally copying pasting code
[15:42:25] <Lavitz> i just have  a folder on my desktop
[15:42:41] <Lavitz> :/Users/Goldie/Desktop/MainSite/index.html# <-- like such
[15:42:45] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  where is your testing environment?
[15:43:11] <Lavitz> its all on the local host if thats what you are asking me
[15:43:47] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  ok... and is it relative to the file paths you are showing? Meaning is it also in /MainSite/ ?
[15:44:06] <Lavitz> yah
[15:44:26] <Lavitz> my images are all in the MainSite folde r
[15:44:50] <LindsayMac> crap i'd look but I seem to have froze my browser
[15:45:36] <Lavitz> C:\Users\Goldie\Desktop\MainSite\my_images\01.jpeg so thats a path right there correct?
[15:45:52] <LindsayMac> stop using \
[15:46:18] <Lavitz> oh
[15:46:24] <Lavitz> should be using this one right
[15:46:28] <LindsayMac> but yes.. if you type that path into your computer's run command (if you're on windows) you should get that image.. does that happen?
[15:46:34] <BinaryKitten> also don't use "C:\...."
[15:46:36] <dogarrhea2> replace \ with /
[15:46:47] <dogarrhea2> and then you will \o/
[15:47:27] <Lavitz> "MainSite/my_images/";
[15:47:29] <Lavitz> so like that?
[15:47:30] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  if they are in your root directory, you only need / as a file page
[15:47:38] <Lavitz> ok
[15:47:47] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  are your pictures in a folder called my_images?
[15:47:54] <Lavitz> yah
[15:48:07] <LindsayMac> you also should not really use caps or spaces in your file / folder names.. but thats not the cause of this
[15:49:00] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  so when you run your code, what is the file path that it is trying to get?
[15:49:16] <LindsayMac> and did you change your code to /my_image/ ?
[15:49:25] <LindsayMac> and why do you have two \\ there?
[15:49:34] <Lavitz> i was testing it
[15:49:40] <Lavitz> i changed it to
[15:49:48] <Lavitz> var imageDir = "/my_images/";
[15:50:00] <LindsayMac> ok..
[15:50:09] <LindsayMac> so what is the path of these broken images?
[15:51:05] <Lavitz> okay
[15:51:05] <Lavitz> so
[15:51:11] <Lavitz> my slide show doesnt  do anything
[15:51:24] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  LOOK at the file path that your code is outputting?
[15:51:31] <LindsayMac> "doesn't do anything" helps no one to help you
[15:51:35] <Lavitz> only image that shows up is the : <img name="slideImg" src="27.jpg" border=0>
[15:51:58] <Lavitz> my scripts are peforming anything
[15:52:28] <dogarrhea2> heh. copy past eyour users/goldie/desktop path and visit in windows exploder
[15:52:51] <dogarrhea2> and by exploder, i mean exploder/explorer
[15:53:17] <Lavitz> file:///C:/Users/Goldie/Desktop/MainSite/index.html#
[15:53:39] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  use firebug to inspect the output.. or do view source
[15:53:41] <Lavitz> thats the patch
[15:53:47] <Lavitz> kk
[15:53:51] <LindsayMac> patch?
[15:54:17] <Lavitz> path* sorry typeo
[15:54:34] <LindsayMac> the path to what?!
[15:55:26] <dogarrhea2> path to the mental hospital
[15:55:40] <LindsayMac> which I seem to be on my way to.
[15:55:44] <LindsayMac> this site is going to KILL me
[15:55:47] <Lavitz> someone requested the path   I see when i launch the page
[15:56:10] <LindsayMac> no Lavitz
[15:56:12] <Lavitz> should I upload my  website folder and you can see it ?
[15:56:23] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  we requested the path of the images that your page is out putting.
[15:56:31] <Lavitz> oh
[15:56:43] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  you seem to be lacking the basic HTML skills here, which is a dangerous thing when debugging JS.
[15:56:45] <Lavitz> file:///C:/Users/Goldie/Desktop/MainSite/27.jpg
[15:57:05] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  so does something look wrong to you about that?
[15:57:18] <amirite> how do i get current mouse coords if it wasn't passed to the event i'm dealing with
[15:57:43] <lindsayo> I need to make jQuery change the classes of an element when the window size is changed, is there a way of telling it to check the window size upon resize?
[15:57:45] <lindsayo> hm, resize.
[15:57:47] <Lavitz> well that the default path thats in place for the image on load
[15:57:48] * lindsayo looks
[15:58:16] <Lavitz> but when i hit play slide show nothing happens
[15:58:24] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  well that is WRONG..
[15:58:34] <LindsayMac> because you clearly said that your images are in my_images /
[15:58:59] <Lavitz> yah and they are
[15:59:03] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  there is breakpoint.js which might help you .
[15:59:20] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  but the path you said your script is calling.... do you see how that is NOT right?
[15:59:38] <Lavitz> No i think im confusing you
[15:59:38] <lindsayo> thx LindsayMac
[15:59:46] <Lavitz> did you get a chance to review my code?
[15:59:56] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  also, have you used css media queries?
[15:59:58] <Lavitz> thats just a default image patch
[16:00:04] <Lavitz> path*
[16:00:14] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: Yes, I'm using CSS media queries.
[16:00:24] <garciawebdev> anybody could help a little? (not a complex problem, I think, more of a theoric one)
[16:00:31] <lindsayo> I'm trying to make my two different chunks of code fire at different window sizes.
[16:00:34] <LindsayMac> Lavitz:  do you see how that is WRONG though> Do you see how it couldnt possibly work becuase its not going to theright directory?
[16:00:44] <lindsayo> But that means that jQuery needs the most recent information about the window size.
[16:00:51] <Lavitz> kk ill change the directory there
[16:00:56] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  okee dokee.. i got it.
[16:00:58] <lindsayo> it's one thing if the window is not pulled around, it's another if someone shrinks the window.
[16:03:02] <lindsayo> I think I'm going to start with       $(window).resize(function () { var windowWidth = $(window).width(); });
[16:03:13] <lindsayo> and then do an if on the windowWidth var
[16:03:20] <lindsayo> does that make sense?
[16:03:52] <LindsayMac> it makes sense.. but I dont know much about dealing with window sizes and such/ I"m still learning on that front
[16:04:00] <lindsayo> Me, too!
[16:04:00] <lindsayo> :)
[16:04:06] <lindsayo> Never done a mobile site before.
[16:04:11] <lindsayo> It's been fun.
[16:04:27] <LindsayMac> Are you doing a responsive mobile? So one theme two looks?
[16:04:38] <lindsayo> More like 4 looks.
[16:04:48] <LindsayMac> well.. responsive none the less..
[16:04:53] <Lavitz> C:\Users\Goldie\Desktop\MainSite\my_images so thats where my pics are located on my PC . so my img src = "/my_images/
[16:04:55] <LindsayMac> not just a straight up mobile
[16:04:56] <Lavitz> is that correct?
[16:05:00] <lindsayo> We have a three main breakpoints in the style docs, but my section needs more.
[16:05:39] <LindsayMac> interesting
[16:05:53] <lindsayo> oh hrm, I'm still learning about scope for variables.
[16:06:16] <pifantastic> lindsayo: for that code to work you need to remove the var
[16:06:19] <LindsayMac> yea im still learning about everything regarding JS for the most part
[16:06:28] <lindsayo> pifantastic: thank you.
[16:06:28] <pifantastic> otherwise windowWidth is only available within the resize handler
[16:06:53] <lindsayo> heh, yeah I just figured that out.
[16:07:08] <lindsayo> But I don't want to wrap my main work in the resize event
[16:07:58] <lindsayo> I <3 Firebug
[16:08:08] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  ahahah i am starting to hate it!
[16:08:09] <LindsayMac> haha
[16:08:31] <dogarrhea2> i like ie debugger
[16:08:35] <dogarrhea2> just kidding.
[16:08:39] <lindsayo> ha
[16:08:41] <lindsayo> whew
[16:08:42] <tw2113> Hey Hey, why do you love it?, Hey yo, why do you hate it?
[16:09:18] <tw2113> *waits for replies*
[16:09:39] <Lavitz> Lindsay any help ?
[16:09:41] <lindsayo> Is there a preferred syntax for such replies?
[16:09:47] <tw2113> nope
[16:09:58] <tw2113> i simply asked you why you loved it, and asked "other lindsay" why she hates it
[16:10:12] <lindsayo> ha, oh right.
[16:10:16] <lindsayo> Forgot about the nick nicks.
[16:10:27] <tw2113> ;)
[16:10:52] <lindsayo> I love all the debugging in one place, being able to update the page instantly, etc.
[16:11:10] <tw2113> i'm still waiting for the Firefox native inspector to get 1 window
[16:11:24] <Lavitz> So i fixed teh path but  my slide show still doesn't work
[16:12:08] <pifantastic> lindsayo: chrome devtools are pretty awesome, you should give them a shot
[16:12:30] <lindsayo> I think they've come a long way.
[16:12:47] <lindsayo> I'm kinda used to FB now, so feel like Chrome devtools are a little clunky.
[16:12:58] <lindsayo> But yes, I should take a week and just use them to get used to them.
[16:14:58] <tw2113> stick with the browser you prefer, is my thoughts
[16:15:19] <dogarrhea2> debugging iframes sucks on all browsers
[16:15:31] <dogarrhea2> especially cross i frame communication
[16:16:40] <tw2113> easy solution, ditch iframes asap
[16:16:50] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[16:16:54] <MistuhKurtz> is it possible to animate auto-height?
[16:16:59] <MistuhKurtz> from a fixed height?
[16:17:15] <tw2113> i think animating that stuff requires pixel values
[16:18:09] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  no but you CAN calculate height first and set it to a variable and go that way
[16:18:13] <LindsayMac> I can give you my code if you want.
[16:18:24] <MistuhKurtz> haha I was just looking at a stack overflow answer that said the same thing LindsayMac :)
[16:18:25] <MistuhKurtz> ty
[16:18:53] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  this is basically it var $collapsedBox = Math.round(.02 * $(window).height());
[16:19:13] <LindsayMac> replace (window) with your element and the .02 to whatever percentage
[16:19:28] <dogarrhea2> tw2113: i doubt that chat vendors can "ditch iframes asap"
[16:19:46] <dogarrhea2> u know those things where you talk to a sales agent via a web client chat widget?
[16:19:54] <MistuhKurtz> It's for a menu that slides down when hovered over... I think I could position the child that needs to slide down with top:-100%; and animate it to 0
[16:19:55] <dogarrhea2> that's all cross domain
[16:20:21] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  if that works
[16:20:37] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  its animating TO the height 100% thats impossible without calc.
[16:21:33] <MistuhKurtz> yeah
[16:21:57] <LindsayMac> If anyone can help me with a preventDefault() issue, i would be super psyched. My code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/vaTWq/
[16:22:59] <LindsayMac> and right now, there seems to be something amiss with it. Tried to simplify using the code in comments beneth the .scrollTo code.. and simple add a flag with an if statement, but there's an issue
[16:23:40] <LindsayMac> I can only seem to hook into the .animate function and NOT the scroll AND animate. I need to disable clicking on the top menu while all animations / .css changes are taking place
[16:27:14] <LindsayMac> anyone?
[16:34:55] <pifantastic> LindsayMac: looking...
[16:35:02] <LindsayMac> ph pifantastic thanks!
[16:38:08] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, totally forgot about slideUp/slideDown :P
[16:38:16] <MistuhKurtz> that seems to be able to animate to auto height just fine... I wonder how it works internally
[16:38:59] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  I think there is some kind of inherent difference where its not always the idea solution..
[16:39:34] <LindsayMac> well i guess you couldn't do a percentage of a height..
[16:40:38] <LindsayMac> pifantastic:  if you read the comments, you can switch between the two scrollTo initializations
[16:43:48] <lindsayo> crud, I had no idea this resize thing would be such a big deal. LindsayMac I can see why you recommended a plugin.
[16:44:11] <ezio> lala la don't funk with my hear
[16:44:12] <ezio> t
[16:44:21] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  yea.. its easiest to use a plugin for it.. especially since it was made with specific browser sizes in mind to start
[16:45:19] <MistuhKurtz> what are you trying to accomplish, lindsayo?
[16:45:47] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  shes wanting to run different scripts based on which size the screen is
[16:46:17] <MistuhKurtz> CSS @media-queries don't work?
[16:46:23] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  we already went over that
[16:46:31] <MistuhKurtz> lol yeah I thought about that
[16:46:34] <lindsayo> Overall, I want to have different animations for the appearance of an element depending on mobile or wide format.
[16:46:47] <MistuhKurtz> Can you name specifics?
[16:46:54] <lindsayo> If it's tablet or desktop, I want the element to slideUp.
[16:46:57] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  you COULD just addClass / removeClass and initialize your animations based on class
[16:47:01] <lindsayo> If it's mobile, I want the element to slide over.
[16:47:07] <lindsayo> Yes, I'm doing that.
[16:47:25] <lindsayo> I'm doing if window.width < 793 { do stuff }
[16:47:40] <lindsayo> and if window.widht > 793 { do stuff }
[16:47:42] <LindsayMac> yup
[16:47:44] <langhun> l
[16:47:45] <lindsayo> And it works.
[16:47:50] <lindsayo> I just wanted it to work on resize.
[16:47:50] <LindsayMac> but...
[16:47:52] <lindsayo> Which it does not.
[16:47:58] <LindsayMac> Ohhh you need to refresh teh calculation
[16:48:05] <lindsayo> So if someone changes the window size, it doesn't referesh...
[16:48:06] <Randomachiever> LindsayMac, Sup girl
[16:48:07] <lindsayo> exactly
[16:48:12] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:      $(window).bind('resize', full_pc);
[16:48:20] <Brodingo> matchMedia? respond?
[16:48:21] <LindsayMac> replace full_pc with your function
[16:48:25] <LindsayMac> Randomachiever:  hey there
[16:48:30] <lindsayo> ah, okay.
[16:48:34] * lindsayo fiddles
[16:48:36] <LindsayMac> Randomachiever:  still dealing with the same crap as last night..
[16:48:41] <Randomachiever> No more gumpies today I hope :)
[16:48:48] <LindsayMac> earlier.. but no mas
[16:48:50] <sunbeam> is there a generic way to disable an input field?
[16:48:50] <Randomachiever> awwww mother f**
[16:48:54] <Brodingo> no grumps allowed
[16:49:03] <Randomachiever> LindsayMac, They are helly of your skills
[16:49:04] <LindsayMac> ;) Brodingo
[16:49:07] <Randomachiever> jelly*
[16:49:10] <sunbeam> (eg. make no input in the text,radio or select dropdown field possible) ?
[16:49:16] <Brodingo> sunbeam you can set the disabled attribute
[16:49:21] <LindsayMac> hahah.. well my skills ain't there when it comes to jquery / js ... but maybe
[16:49:24] <sunbeam> Brodingo: for all types of input fields?
[16:49:33] <Brodingo> probably
[16:49:44] <lindsayo> oh, so now I have to turn my code into a function.
[16:49:49] <lindsayo> Never done that before.
[16:49:50] <Randomachiever> KK gonna get some work done, just wanted to say whats up :)
[16:49:52] * lindsayo reads
[16:49:56] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  hold on.. lemme show you my code
[16:50:06] <LindsayMac> Ill show you mine if you show me yours...
[16:50:07] <LindsayMac> haha
[16:50:20] <lindsayo> heh
[16:50:23] * Randomachiever Waits in excitement
[16:50:24] <Brodingo> no innuendos allowed
[16:50:28] <lindsayo> that got the boys' attention
[16:50:35] <LindsayMac>    full_pc();
[16:50:35] <LindsayMac>     $(window).bind('resize', full_pc);
[16:50:39] <LindsayMac> that
[16:50:46] <Randomachiever> <--- My attention
[16:50:55] <LindsayMac> hahaha...
[16:51:05] <sunbeam> Brodingo: disabled="disabled" >?
[16:51:10] <Brodingo> yeah
[16:51:18] <sunbeam> nvm
[16:51:25] <sunbeam> should be disabled="true" i think
[16:51:28] <sunbeam> anyway let me try
[16:51:32] <Brodingo> i dont think so
[16:51:51] <sunbeam> and ofc attr instead of css my bad
[16:52:14] <sunbeam> jQuery(".ngg-disabled").attr("disabled", "disabled"); seems fine
[16:54:56] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: like this? http://pastebin.com/5pq1TFXX
[16:55:27] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  let's make a jsfiddle.net setup..
[16:55:34] <LindsayMac> you can test and log and all that fun stuff
[16:57:09] <lindsayo> http://jsfiddle.net/M4H65/
[16:57:26] <lindsayo> I haven't used this before. Interesting.
[16:57:34] <LindsayMac> Ok so if ANYONE wants to take a look.. i am still trying to figure out how to disable clicks (preventdefault) while animations / .css changes are happening
[16:57:49] <LindsayMac> my issue is that I can't seem to pin down ALL animations to hook in to http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/vaTWq/
[16:57:54] <coldhead> cheese and rice
[16:57:54] <b-ot> coldhead, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[16:57:59] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  its so cool
[17:00:17] <LindsayMac> cheese and rice calls the bot?
[17:00:25] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  looked at your code now
[17:00:41] <lindsayo> I'm not sure how to get it to do anything.
[17:00:45] <lindsayo> the jsfiddle, I mean
[17:01:10] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  well you don't have any actual HTML elements in there.. you need to build up your structure too
[17:01:12] <LindsayMac> working on it.
[17:01:47] <lindsayo> I put the classed div in there.
[17:02:13] <jedimind> lindsay are you just talking to yourself in two clients?
[17:02:16] <LindsayMac> I didnt see it.. but dont worry..
[17:02:20] <LindsayMac> lol there's TWO LINDSAYS!
[17:02:27] <imsky> but only one imsky
[17:02:34] <dogarrhea2> and a lot of dogarrhea
[17:02:35] <imsky> THERE CAN BE
[17:02:37] <imsky> ONLY NONE
[17:02:52] * jedimind throws a sword on the ground between the two lindsays
[17:02:54] <jedimind> and... GO
[17:03:03] <lindsayo> ha
[17:03:08] <lindsayo> Women work together.
[17:03:09] <LindsayMac> I win
[17:03:12] <LindsayMac> lol
[17:03:13] <lindsayo> oh man.
[17:03:14] <lindsayo> lol

[17:03:28] <jedimind> "women work together" *stab*
[17:03:29] <imsky> you kidding me?
[17:03:30] <lindsayo> I guess.
[17:03:32] <imsky> women can't work together
[17:03:44] <dogarrhea2> they certainly do
[17:03:50] <imsky> don't*?
[17:03:59] <dogarrhea2> whenever you go to a club and try to talk to one of two women,
[17:04:01] <jedimind> lets not get ahead of ourselves, i can confirm that only one is definitely female
[17:04:04] <jedimind> i mean, it is the internets
[17:04:08] <dogarrhea2> the other one kicks you in the nuts
[17:04:11] <jedimind> what are the chances of two women being in the same place at the same time on the internet
[17:04:11] <imsky> dogarrhea2, that's different from business
[17:04:14] <imsky> OR IS IT
[17:04:29] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: can this thing detect resize in the fiddle?
[17:04:41] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  yea ..
[17:04:45] <imsky> jedimind, pretty high, have u heard of pinterest.com?
[17:04:56] <imsky> its an underground site

[17:05:48] <coldhead> please, i'm trying to be depressed
[17:05:49] <LindsayMac> alirghty then
[17:05:53] <imsky> SHUT UP DEPRESSO
[17:05:54] <jedimind> pintrest is to internet what barbie branded laptops are to computing
[17:06:06] <imsky> jedimind is a grade B misogynist
[17:06:15] <jedimind> B+ if you will
[17:06:21] <imsky> solid B
[17:06:24] <imsky> let's not curve here

[17:06:49] <jedimind> hairy nipples ftw
[17:06:51] <imsky> hows business, pud?
[17:07:00] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  AHHH you need to call the jquery files in the framework panel on the left side!
[17:07:12] <lindsayo> ah, okay. looking.
[17:07:26] <jedimind> imsky, its going
[17:07:32] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: I ticked 1.8.18 for the ui
[17:07:43] <lindsayo> and 1.7.2 in the framework dropdown.
[17:07:48] <ezio> GUMP, WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY? To do whatever you tell me to, Drill Sargeant. GODDAMNIT GUMP THAT IS THE MOST OUTSTANDING ANSWER I HAVE EVER HEARD. YOU MUST BE SOME KIND OF GENIUS WITH AN IQ OF 160.
[17:07:55] <imsky> good to know jedimind
[17:08:06] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  mine doesnt update with what you do... it saved versions
[17:08:07] <jedimind> isnt it ?
[17:08:12] <imsky> ezio u read my mind baby wanna make babbys?
[17:08:12] <lindsayo> ah it says width is not defined
[17:08:15] <jedimind> ezio, one of my favourite quotes ever
[17:08:26] <lindsayo> oh I see, LindsayMac
[17:08:30] <lindsayo> I'll press the Update button
[17:08:32] <ezio> imsky, sure, open up i'm comin in
[17:08:33] <lindsayo> let's see if taht helps
[17:08:34] <imsky> jedimind, how are you not russian
[17:08:41] <imsky> you're like latvian or something
[17:08:51] <imsky> with a purely russian name
[17:08:57] <jedimind> there's nothing russian about my name
[17:08:59] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  you have to share the new url when you update
[17:09:02] <jedimind> if you knew anything about russian names
[17:09:03] <imsky> lol u lie
[17:09:07] <imsky> yeah i do
[17:09:08] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: http://jsfiddle.net/M4H65/2/
[17:09:19] <jedimind> so then yo uknow that the common spelling of the name thats similar to mine ends with an I
[17:09:20] <jedimind> not a J
[17:09:21] <ezio> anyone have any outstanding issues?
[17:09:23] <imsky> jedimind, http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%91%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87
[17:09:31] <imsky> u be trippin dawg
[17:09:36] <LindsayMac> I could use some help ezio
[17:09:46] <jedimind> simeon = bulgarian
[17:09:47] <jedimind> noob
[17:09:51] <imsky> ur a noob
[17:09:52] <jedimind> simeonov = "of" simeon
[17:10:09] <imsky> you're not bulgarian tho
[17:10:11] <jedimind> nope
[17:10:13] <ezio> lindsayo, you can make css do that for you by setting min width and something else ... or by just using bootstrap
[17:10:16] <jedimind> and my first name is slovenian
[17:10:18] <imsky> so who cares what it means
[17:10:19] <jedimind> but im not slovenian either
[17:10:20] <LindsayMac> trying to  figure out how to preventDefault click for the nav links until all animations and .css changes take place. I was working on a flag but couldnt bind it to ALL of them ezio
[17:10:20] <ezio> which you should probably do anyway
[17:10:21] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/vaTWq/
[17:10:31] <LindsayMac> ezio:  its more complex than that
[17:10:38] <imsky> jedimind, you're an enigma
[17:10:40] <jedimind> lets not clutter the chan w/ OT shit
[17:10:54] <imsky> thats right jedimind, you should leave for a while
[17:10:55] <lindsayo> jedimind: too late
[17:11:03] <lindsayo> :P
[17:11:15] <jedimind> i dont know what youre talking about
[17:11:21] <imsky> im talking about chicken
[17:11:27] <ezio> LindsayMac, are you sure that you're not over complicating your design?  it looks pretty complex
[17:11:37] <LindsayMac> ezio:  it is a complex page...
[17:11:42] <ezio> and you've had a lot of weird issues
[17:11:47] <LindsayMac> ezio:  no..
[17:11:49] <imsky> lol at that fiddle
[17:11:56] * imsky has an idea
[17:11:59] <imsky> christ it's brilliant
[17:12:06] <imsky> brb registering domain
[17:12:18] <imsky> jsfiddle.org aw yeah baby
[17:12:18] <LindsayMac> ezio:  the only issue is if someone clicks a bunch of times it glitches out, so I just want to disable clicking while animation
[17:12:22] <LindsayMac> everything else is fine
[17:12:48] <ezio> LindsayMac, yes i remember looking at this issue earlier ...
[17:12:52] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  still working on your code
[17:13:01] <LindsayMac> ezio:  everything else is working just fine otherwise
[17:16:46] <ezio> LindsayMac, put it in a satellite function
[17:17:05] <ezio> and have everything call the satellite function
[17:17:06] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i am learning js still.. do you have some reading or examples I can look at to understand what that is?
[17:17:25] <ezio> LindsayMac, conceptually a satellite is something you bounce a request off of
[17:17:33] <ezio> i mean
[17:17:42] <ezio> just create another function in global space
[17:18:07] <ezio> and all events get assigned that as a handler
[17:18:31] <LindsayMac> ezio:  yea..i'm going to need to google that.. like i said, I understand the concept, but the execution/syntax is new to me
[17:18:51] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: dinnertime. bbiab
[17:18:56] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  k
[17:19:03] <ezio> lol no i made up the nomenclature hoping that you would understand
[17:19:14] <ezio> k so you need to stop what functions
[17:19:21] <ezio> stop which events
[17:19:24] <ezio> just the clicks?
[17:19:31] <LindsayMac> ezio:  just the clicks..
[17:19:45] <ezio> point me to the lines
[17:19:45] <LindsayMac> and just duriing the scroll/ whitebox animation
[17:19:54] <ezio> cause i'm lazy
[17:20:23] <LindsayMac> ezio:  I was adding the PreventDefault() at the bottom of the code where you see $scrollTo
[17:20:36] <LindsayMac> that is what triggers the links as smooth scrolling links
[17:20:53] <LindsayMac> I have two ways to initialize, one works and the other doesnt (they are commented as such
[17:21:38] <LindsayMac> ezio:  the animations I am trying to wait until ended are the scrollTo one AND the ones inside the if statement where you see inSnap=true
[17:22:07] <LindsayMac> ezio:  this is teh first line of the animation that happens AFTER the smoothscroll                     $panel.delay(2500).css('visibility','visible').hide().fadeIn('10000');
[17:22:30] <ezio> LindsayMac,   http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/vaTWq/
[17:22:34] <ezio> oops
[17:22:42] <ezio> http://jsfiddle.net/vaTWq/1/
[17:23:31] <ezio> i do take mastercard, folks
[17:23:34] <ezio> next!
[17:23:36] <LindsayMac> ezio:  yea.. that is the error I was getting with that top code.. if you use the one beneath it, no error
[17:23:40] <LindsayMac> ezio:  WHAT?
[17:23:48] <LindsayMac> ezio: are you not getting the tag error?
[17:24:04] <LindsayMac> ezio: TypeError: targ is undefined
[17:24:04] <ezio> that is a negatve
[17:24:36] <LindsayMac> ezio:  but it's not smooth scrolling ?
[17:25:07] <ezio> well then that's a different issue
[17:25:21] <ezio> but it is preventing the clicks
[17:25:22] <ezio> right?
[17:25:27] <LindsayMac> ezio:  http://cl.ly/image/10391l030v10
[17:25:52] <LindsayMac> ezio:  its not doing anything...
[17:25:55] <ezio> maybe you were conceived with a weak sperm
[17:26:02] <ezio> but i would bet that it's a cache issue
[17:26:25] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i did a hard refresh
[17:26:29] <LindsayMac> plus, its a different ur
[17:26:30] <LindsayMac> l
[17:26:34] <ezio> thanks for including the address bar, though
[17:26:49] <LindsayMac> ezio:  well i wanted you to know i wasn't an idiot and looking back at my own code
[17:26:53] <ezio> yes good point .. what browser are you using?
[17:27:00] <ezio> oh duh
[17:27:01] <ezio> nm
[17:27:02] <ezio> ff
[17:27:09] <ezio> i checked ff, too
[17:27:11] <ezio> lemme recheck
[17:28:16] <ezio> k i'm debugging
[17:28:18] <LindsayMac> ezio:  its def. not stopping clicks befre animation is complete on my computer.
[17:28:31] <LindsayMac> ezio:  ok.. It actually seems like it decides to runt he script AFTER I click...
[17:29:14] <imsky> what
[17:30:16] <ezio> LindsayMac, this.hash is invalid
[17:30:26] <ezio> the object this is an array of html elements
[17:31:00] <LindsayMac> ohhh kay .
[17:31:23] <ezio> do you know how to debug?
[17:31:29] <ezio> i'm assuming you do
[17:31:46] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i am learning the debug tools for js
[17:31:55] <LindsayMac> but am open to suggestions / ideas and pointers always
[17:31:56] <ezio> LindsayMac, use chrome
[17:32:10] <LindsayMac> Ahh i know.. There is something wrong with Chrome these days. I can not get it to install on my mac.
[17:32:16] <LindsayMac> something with new installs and my version
[17:32:48] <ezio> well you know how to set break points
[17:32:49] <LindsayMac> ezio:  ive been cursing the chrome gods because i come into an issue and realize that debugging with firebug is NOT as good as with chrome
[17:32:50] <ezio> add watches
[17:32:54] <ezio> and use the immediate window
[17:32:55] <ezio> right?
[17:33:04] <tw2113> i've heard chrome doesn't like mountain lion yet
[17:33:05] <LindsayMac> ezio:  yea.. i learned about watches and break points I read about but havent used much
[17:33:56] <ezio> oh no
[17:33:58] <ezio> dear lord
[17:34:16] <ezio> you literally can't do your job without debugging
[17:34:26] <LindsayMac> ezio:  as I said.. js is very new to me. I know php and and other languages.. but new to this
[17:34:32] <ezio> it will add 90% to your work load
[17:34:36] <LindsayMac> there is no debugging in the browser with php
[17:34:50] <tw2113> ezio so show her a tutorial or so on breakpoints
[17:34:52] <ezio> no but pdt does that for you
[17:34:53] <LindsayMac> ezio:  well.. this being my first JS heavy site.. I am learning all the tools.
[17:35:08] <ezio> LindsayMac, xdebug
[17:35:10] <LindsayMac> pdt?
[17:35:36] <ezio> eclipse pdt is a multi platform php ide
[17:35:44] <ezio> if you've ever used eclipse
[17:35:50] <ezio> it's eclipse for php
[17:35:55] <ezio> and it allows you to debug
[17:36:01] <ezio> it's a bitch to set up the first time
[17:36:04] <ezio> but don't give up
[17:36:13] <ezio> you'll learn to do it forever
[17:36:18] <ezio> and it will save you time
[17:36:25] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i'll def. look in to that. Those are the types of things I definitely take time to learn
[17:36:50] <ezio> LindsayMac, chrome and ff debugging is about the easiest thing you can learn
[17:36:54] <LindsayMac> ezio:  ive been pretty good so far with simply debugging the "old way" with dumping and printing etc
[17:36:56] <ezio> 20 minutes
[17:37:00] <ezio> look on youtube
[17:37:17] <ezio> LindsayMac,
[17:37:21] <ezio> quick tutorial
[17:37:27] <ezio> any browser press f12
[17:37:30] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i read a few articles but because I am new to the language, sometimes I am not fully sure what to debug
[17:37:49] <ezio> mosey on over to the script tab
[17:37:52] <ezio> and enable it
[17:37:53] <tw2113> we all kick the tires in our own way
[17:38:07] <ezio> find your file that has
[17:38:07] <tw2113> ?ftj
[17:38:14] <ezio> $.scrollTo(this.hash, 2500, {onAfter:function() {
[17:38:15] <tw2113> bah
[17:38:33] <ezio> where the line number is, click on the actual number to add a break point
[17:38:36] <ezio> rerun your script
[17:38:44] <ezio> now when you hit that line(after clicking)
[17:38:46] <LindsayMac> I was using the watch panel when I was trying to do the flag method..
[17:38:50] <ezio> you can run your mouse over everything
[17:39:06] <tw2113> LindsayMac http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 via ajpiano
[17:39:10] <LindsayMac> hold on.. f12 on a mac is some convoluted combination of keys
[17:39:22] <imsky> yes..fn+f12
[17:39:44] <LindsayMac> no.
[17:39:53] <imsky> ye
[17:40:02] <ezio> http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Keyboard_and_Mouse_Shortcuts
[17:40:19] <ezio> LindsayMac, just press the f12 key
[17:40:24] <ezio> you don't need to press fn
[17:40:38] <rainabba> anyone else finding that pastebin isn't behaving nicely right now?
[17:40:41] <LindsayMac> ezio:  not on mac..
[17:40:48] <rainabba> In particular if you're a paid user...
[17:41:04] <LindsayMac> it controls my volume.. and fn f12 just toggles my dashb
[17:41:09] <ezio> LindsayMac, what keyboard and os are you using?
[17:41:18] <imsky> LindsayMac, http://forums.adobe.com/thread/734289
[17:41:19] <LindsayMac> ezio:  the wired full size
[17:41:23] <imsky> lol at mac users in general
[17:41:28] <tw2113> meh, pastebin sucks for javascript stuff rainabba
[17:41:30] <ezio> LindsayMac, you don' thave firebug installed?
[17:41:35] <tw2113> jsbin/jsfiddle is better and interactive
[17:41:50] <rainabba> tw2113: Preferred?
[17:41:54] <rainabba> ok, ty
[17:41:56] <tw2113> either
[17:42:09] <LindsayMac> imsky:  i know this.. there's shortcuts set on my cpu. there is a convoluted way around them ,, but it will take a min for me ti find it.. or just turn them off
[17:42:15] <tw2113> jsbin has easier toggling of panes
[17:42:18] <imsky> GOOD LUCK SOLDIER
[17:42:44] <ezio> LindsayMac, well reassign f12 cause you need it for development
[17:42:47] <LindsayMac> ezio:  Well while I deal with that.. when i remove the this.hash to just hash ... the clicks are not prevented still
[17:42:51] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i am about to
[17:43:05] <tw2113> unless you can assign firebug to any key shortcut you want
[17:43:12] <tw2113> or just use the right click menu
[17:43:19] <tw2113> or just click the bug
[17:43:28] <ezio> yes but all browsers honour f12 now
[17:43:39] <LindsayMac> wait.. i launch firebug with the bug. Not a big deal
[17:43:42] <tw2113> same destination, different route
[17:44:14] <LindsayMac> Ahh ok.
[17:44:25] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i thought you were saying there was some hidden FB thing I didnt know about
[17:44:25] <imsky> f12 is so much faster
[17:44:30] <imsky> and universal across ie/chrome/firefox
[17:44:57] <tw2113> i like how everyone but LindsayMac is crying about LindsayMac's F12 key doesn't launch firebug at the moment
[17:45:00] <LindsayMac> well.. for now, I want to work on getting this code working.. I can launch FB so i'm good
[17:45:10] <ezio> either way go to the script tab
[17:45:14] <rainabba> Following is a paste of the JS I'm using to consume $.autocomplete against a .Net JSON webservice. I can access the webservice by its URL just fine (on my dev machine and the production one), but when I try to consume it using the jquery in the paste, I get an error 500 (though I can't easily test this same scenario on my dev machine). I'm guessing that someone who is more familiar with
[17:45:14] <rainabba> .autocomplete and JSON will see that I'm calling it wrong from my JS and can tell me how to do this right. Help? :)  Thanks in advance (I'm new to JSON and webservices)  http://jsbin.com/welcome/9412/edit
[17:45:21] <ezio> set a break point on that line
[17:46:20] <LindsayMac> the re-run the script?
[17:46:45] <ezio> are you on the jsfiddle
[17:46:47] <ezio> or your own version
[17:46:51] <ezio> do this on your own version
[17:47:20] <LindsayMac> ezio:  well I was first just playing on teh jsfiddle because its simplified
[17:47:34] <ezio> under js fiddle
[17:47:38] <ezio> you have to go to ...
[17:47:59] <LindsayMac> ezio:  so if setting the breakpoint on that line then gives me a working script, what does that mean? what are generally the next steps of debugging this way?
[17:48:08] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i've alreayd gotten there and set the breakpoint
[17:48:24] <ezio> okay sweet
[17:48:27] <ezio> now trigger the event
[17:48:43] <LindsayMac> done
[17:48:53] <ezio> now hold your mouse over ever variable
[17:48:58] <ezio> til you find what you're looking for
[17:49:10] <ezio> any > arrows can be expanded deeper into the object
[17:49:14] <LindsayMac> I dont know what you mean though..
[17:49:31] <tw2113> you're able to see the state of everything at that breakpoint
[17:49:38] <LindsayMac> from which panel?
[17:49:50] <tw2113> if you have a variable you set after the breakpoint, it'll be null, if before, it'll be set
[17:49:53] <ezio> so you put a break point on 864 right?
[17:49:58] <LindsayMac> ezio:  yea..
[17:50:23] <ezio> and now execution is halted on that line right?
[17:50:29] <ezio> you have a circle and an arrow
[17:50:42] <LindsayMac> ezio:  it runs as normal.. i do not see where i would see the list of events fired
[17:50:46] <tw2113> should see a panel on the right with a tab of "watch"
[17:50:57] <LindsayMac> i open the script panel, go to break points and I see the line with the point you told me to set
[17:51:07] <ezio> yeha ... weird
[17:51:12] <ezio> it isn't breaking in fb
[17:51:16] <ezio> i know why
[17:51:37] <ezio> do you see just above the code
[17:51:43] <ezio> tere's a drop down that says inline?
[17:51:48] <ezio> inline v
[17:51:57] <ezio> v = down caret
[17:51:57] <LindsayMac> ahh yep
[17:52:06] <ezio> drop that down select the second inline
[17:52:14] <ezio> scroll down to about 95 is where your code is
[17:52:17] <LindsayMac> it is selected
[17:52:21] <ezio> now set your break point in the right place
[17:52:30] <ezio> then refresh the page
[17:52:33] <LindsayMac> ezio:  my breakpoint has been set in the right place..
[17:52:40] <ezio> on what line?
[17:53:01] <ezio> what line number
[17:53:03] <LindsayMac> well first you said on the line with the this.hash and then you said 864 so i tried both
[17:53:19] <LindsayMac> 876 and 864
[17:53:20] <ezio> no ... drop that box down and select the second
[17:53:24] <ezio> inline
[17:53:32] <ezio> the second from the top
[17:53:37] <ezio> you'll see your code again
[17:53:43] <LindsayMac> it is http://cl.ly/image/1P2E2O1T0635
[17:54:01] <ezio> this time on lie 136
[17:54:20] <ezio> try the third one then
[17:54:28] <tw2113> can it be thursday/friday right naoo?
[17:54:32] <ezio> look for the inline where your code is on line 136
[17:54:59] <ezio> that's why i told you ... jsfiddle is a bugger to debug the first time
[17:55:02] <LindsayMac> ok yea it was the third one
[17:55:06] <ezio> best to use your own
[17:55:12] <ezio> k now set the break point
[17:55:16] <ezio> and click the link
[17:55:18] <LindsayMac> done
[17:55:25] <ezio> now you should be stopped
[17:55:29] <ezio> with the line highlighted
[17:55:33] <ezio> and > at the left side
[17:55:53] <LindsayMac> I click the link above the breakpoint that I set in that rright side window?
[17:56:01] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: back.
[17:56:03] <LindsayMac> clicking that highlights the line I just set.. no >
[17:56:11] <lindsayo> mmm grilled chicken and broccoli.
[17:56:18] <LindsayMac> ezio:  o
[17:56:25] <ezio> LindsayMac, now click the link
[17:56:27] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i'm not sure what i'm "supposed" to be seeing her e
[17:56:29] <ezio> now that you have that red circle
[17:56:37] <LindsayMac> ezio:  clicking the link highlights the line in blue
[17:56:42] <ezio> good
[17:56:46] <LindsayMac> k
[17:56:47] <ezio> now hold your mouse over this
[17:57:04] <LindsayMac> over what?
[17:57:16] <ezio> over this
[17:57:19] <ezio> "this"
[17:57:21] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i am SOO sorry that this is so difficult
[17:57:24] <ezio> no
[17:57:32] <ezio> you're about to have an epiphany
[17:57:47] <ezio> and i don't mind teaching someone to debug
[17:57:50] <ezio> cause it's so vital
[17:57:55] <coldhead> i love epiphanies
[17:57:56] <LindsayMac> haha ok . one sec
[17:58:29] <LindsayMac> ezio:  I dont know.. i feel like a moron.
[17:58:44] <LindsayMac> clicking the link.. moving my mouse over "this" and nuthin
[17:59:08] <imsky> i love Epiphany
[17:59:44] <LindsayMac> ezio:  it's possible that my firebug is just set up differently in preference because I'm not usualy debugging js?
[17:59:46] <ezio> LindsayMac, i'm tempted to ask you if you would mind a teamviewer sess
[18:00:13] <LindsayMac> ezio:  if you want to!
[18:00:24] <ezio> http://teamviewer.com
[18:00:27] <LindsayMac> I mean, i know this is a lot
[18:00:32] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i'll pm you
[18:07:43] <imsky> hey i want in on this teamviewer action
[18:08:18] <imsky> bet i can solve problems so fast
[18:08:20] <ezio> LindsayMac, so now you know what i'm talking about
[18:08:28] <LindsayMac> yes.. absolutely
[18:08:52] <LindsayMac> ezio:  thanks again!
[18:09:02] <aaairc> is it possible to combine two jquery selectors into one... so for example can $('#flyers .flyer.theater') and $('#flyers .flyer.dance') be combined into one selector?
[18:09:04] <ezio> np
[18:09:04] <imsky> teamviewer party
[18:09:05] <imsky> let's do it
[18:09:15] <ezio> imsky, has ben left out
[18:09:18] <ezio> let's pet him
[18:09:22] <wroathe> I asked a question in here earlier and was disconnected so here it goes once more: What part of the jQuery source makes the jQuery object array-like? I'm trying to replicate that behavior so that I understand what's going on behind the scenes.
[18:09:26] <imsky> lol ive been petted
[18:09:38] <imsky> wroathe, the jquery object is a quasi-array
[18:10:17] <imsky> it implements .slice and such, but it's still a jQuery object
[18:10:53] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i'm gonna do some testing on my main site and HOPE that it works out.
[18:11:26] <ezio> good.  i think you'll have a better idea what's going on watching everything as it works
[18:11:30] <ezio> oh
[18:11:30] <tw2113> it'll go boom
[18:11:34] <tw2113> :D
[18:11:34] <ezio> umm
[18:11:36] <ezio> just some tips
[18:11:36] <wroathe> imsky: I get that but when I do the whole closure return thing and then try an assignment like var a = OtherQuery('a'); I get an object like OtherQuery.fn.init
[18:11:39] <imsky> wroathe, http://robflaherty.github.com/jquery-annotated-source/docs/01-core.html#section-23
[18:11:42] <LindsayMac> sure
[18:11:43] <imsky> yep
[18:11:44] <ezio> f10 goes line by line
[18:11:48] <imsky> fn.init is the object wroa
[18:11:50] <ezio> f11 goes into a function
[18:11:50] <imsky> wroathe,
[18:12:06] <ezio> and f8 is continue until it hits the next break point or indefinitely
[18:12:13] <imsky> if you do jQuery.fn.init("whatever") you get lots of fun
[18:12:16] <ezio> if you have an anonymous function
[18:12:19] <LindsayMac> ezio: I'll reconfiguring my f keys ...
[18:12:33] <tw2113> fight the power LindsayMac
[18:12:33] <ezio> you have to set a breakpoint inside of the function
[18:12:38] <ezio> to get it to break
[18:12:39] <ezio> ie
[18:12:46] <LindsayMac> ahh ok.that makes sense
[18:12:55] <ezio> $('a').click(function(){
[18:13:04] <ezio> var a=5;
[18:13:07] <ezio> ++a;
[18:13:12] <ezio> }
[18:13:18] <ezio> to break on var a=5
[18:13:21] <ezio> you can't hit f10
[18:13:25] <ezio> you have to set a break oint
[18:13:28] <wroathe> I see that the jQuery object has a lot of array-like methods implemented but the part that is a mystery to me is how the jQuery object returns [a, b, c] instead of jQuery
[18:13:28] <ezio> point
[18:13:42] <LindsayMac> Ok.. making some sense..
[18:13:55] <LindsayMac> good thing I got logs. I can always come back to this if i get confused
[18:14:07] <wroathe> like if you do var a = jQuery('a'); and then just type a to evaluate it in console you get [<a></a>, <a></a>]
[18:14:08] <imsky> wroathe, the jQuery obj IS an array
[18:14:42] <ezio> LindsayMac, it's all in the menu for scripts
[18:14:47] <wroathe> imsky: I get that but is there some point in the code that basically says this = []; ?
[18:14:49] <ezio> all the buttons tell you the shortcut key
[18:14:57] <imsky> wroathe, yep, read the code if you really care
[18:14:58] <LindsayMac> ezio: yea playig with it now.. because sadly.. the code frm the fiddle doesnt work on the site
[18:15:06] <imsky> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.fn.init
[18:15:12] <wroathe> imsky: Yeah. I have been reading it, just missing where it explicitly states that.
[18:15:19] <imsky> return jQuery.makeArray(selector, this);
[18:15:39] <imsky> though .call and .slice are overridden, so it's not entirely clear what you're reading half the time
[18:16:25] <wroathe> imsky: Yeah. I saw that makeArray method but there are many other points in that init method where it returns before hitting that statement.
[18:16:32] <LindsayMac> ezio:  when you make changes to your script, a hard refresh of the page should clear it up in firebug right?
[18:16:47] <ezio> a regular one will do
[18:16:51] <wroathe> If you set a breakpoint at the start of the init method 'this' evaluates to []
[18:16:52] <ezio> just remember
[18:16:55] <ezio> as you edit
[18:17:04] <ezio> if you set a break point at line 146
[18:17:10] <ezio> but add a new function in at line 12
[18:17:17] <wroathe> So something before hitting that init method has already turns jQuery into an array
[18:17:25] <LindsayMac> update the breakpoint
[18:17:27] <ezio> you're gonna have to redo your breakpoint
[18:17:31] <ezio> yup
[18:17:44] <ezio> you'll get into all the nooks and crannies
[18:17:56] <ezio> when you're pro you'll use the immediate window for EVERYTHING
[18:18:28] <LindsayMac> thanks so much
[18:18:39] <ezio> np
[18:19:18] <LindsayMac> ezio:  unfortunately.. some of the troubles with troubleshooting when you're new is that you don't always know what to look for.
[18:19:32] <ezio> yup ... it's an experience thing
[18:19:39] <ezio> something you can't teach
[18:19:51] <LindsayMac> yep.. this i know
[18:20:00] <ezio> the way i remember myself learning unix systems
[18:20:14] <ezio> was like crawling under barbes wire with my m4a1 in hand
[18:20:24] <ezio> barbed
[18:20:53] <LindsayMac> hahaha
[18:21:52] <imsky> wroathe, also look at http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.makeArray
[18:22:06] <LindsayMac> ezio:  so after i run a breakpoint, how do I clear it up so I can run another, because it seems like when I run one, i can't click anymore links on my site
[18:22:16] <ezio> f8
[18:22:21] <LindsayMac> ahh damn
[18:22:24] <ezio> or
[18:22:27] <ezio> hit the play button
[18:22:48] <ezio> holding your mouse over the play button will tell you what button to press
[18:24:21] <ezio> LindsayMac, i want you to remember these two things
[18:24:24] <LindsayMac> ezio:  so running this code on my site, I can see that it is disabling my clicks, but it is breaking somewhere before it gets to the animation to drop the box and fade the content
[18:24:26] <ezio> cause you will definitely ask
[18:24:27] <LindsayMac> k
[18:24:31] <imsky> 1) love is hell
[18:24:37] <imsky> 2) pizza and pepperoni don't mix
[18:24:53] <Brodingo> sorry your life is working out that way imsky
[18:25:00] <ezio> LindsayMac, yes you can dive into another function.  f11
[18:25:00] <imsky> where did you come from lol
[18:25:05] <ezio> remember that
[18:25:08] <ezio> cause you're gonna ask
[18:25:11] <ezio> if you don't remember
[18:25:15] <LindsayMac> haha ok
[18:25:30] <ezio> but there's a little arrow
[18:25:40] <ezio> in the shape of an n
[18:25:47] <ezio> near the play button
[18:26:08] <rainabba> Following is a paste of the JS I'm using to consume $.autocomplete against a .Net JSON webservice. I can access the webservice by its URL just fine (on my dev machine and the production one), but when I try to consume it using the jquery in the paste, I get an error 500 (though I can't easily test this same scenario on my dev machine). I'm guessing that someone who is more familiar with
[18:26:08] <rainabba> .autocomplete and JSON will see that I'm calling it wrong from my JS and can tell me how to do this right. Help? :)  Thanks in advance (I'm new to JSON and webservices)  http://jsbin.com/welcome/9412/edit
[18:26:12] <ezio> when you hold your mouse over it it says step into
[18:26:30] <LindsayMac> yep just found that
[18:26:46] <ezio> yes that's how you get into a function that IS NOT ANONYMOUS
[18:26:54] <ezio> and those are the two things
[18:27:00] <ezio> f11 to get in
[18:27:06] <ezio> adn you can't do it to anonymous functions
[18:27:17] <ezio> but it's handy
[18:27:36] <LindsayMac> I understand about half of what you said.. but i'll get it
[18:27:50] <ezio> LindsayMac, do you have your site web ffacint?
[18:27:53] <ezio> facing?
[18:28:09] <LindsayMac> ezio:  i can give you quick/easy access if you give me your IP
[18:28:18] <imsky> just teamviewer bro
[18:28:19] <LindsayMac> hehe
[18:28:21] <imsky> let's all have a party
[18:30:32] <wroathe> imsky: I figured it out. The browser will interpret an object as an array if it has the length and splice properties.
[18:30:52] <imsky> yeah
[18:30:55] <imsky> could have asked
[18:40:35] <LindsayMac> ugh I was gonna go for a run tonight.. guess not
[18:40:58] <ML74> Could anyone guide me with a button that runs a MySQL query and reloads a row in an HTML table?
[18:41:12] <imsky> damn
[18:41:14] <imsky> that's high tech
[18:41:18] <imsky> i don't think we're there yet buddy
[18:41:22] <imsky> try again in 10 years
[18:41:25] <ML74> lol
[18:41:31] <lindsayo> LindsayMac: you should go for a run.
[18:41:39] <lindsayo> (not that I ever get around to it)
[18:42:07] <LindsayMac> ML74:  have you looked at the jquery data tables ?
[18:42:13] <ML74> nope
[18:42:17] <ML74> will have a look now
[18:42:24] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  if i get this issue worked out, I will likely go first thing in the am tomorrow
[18:42:47] <ML74> basically, it's for a guest list and once the button's pressed, the person's checked in
[18:43:54] <LindsayMac> ML74:  ohhh... hahaha
[18:44:00] <LindsayMac> ML74:  do you know anything about building websites?
[18:44:12] * imsky lols
[18:44:19] <ML74> yep
[18:44:27] <LindsayMac> ML74:  you need to create a form to post it to the DB.
[18:44:47] <LindsayMac> So for instance, a php form to grab the data from your form elements and pass it to a DB
[18:45:03] <ML74> i know how to do this
[18:45:17] <ML74> it's the jquery/ajax stuff that's blowing my mind lol
[18:45:19] <LindsayMac> So your question really doesn't make sense
[18:45:34] <LindsayMac> you dont NEED jquery Ajax to do that.. necessarily
[18:45:44] <ML74> i don't want the page to reload
[18:45:46] <LindsayMac> just make your form, pass it through your php script and it will save to your DB
[18:45:57] <LindsayMac> Oh well thats a different thing
[18:46:18] <ML74> it'll be running on a mobile device (connection may or may not be fast) at the door of a venue, so reloading takes a while
[18:47:18] <LindsayMac> ML74:  do you have the names prior and are checkign attendance or you need to enter a lot of data and then save?
[18:47:48] <ML74> in each table row is the name, drop down with number of guests and a checkin button
[18:48:03] <ML74> select the number of guests present on the drop down, then hit the checkin button for that row
[18:48:24] <LindsayMac> ML74:  is this for a host to do or the guests/
[18:48:28] <ML74> host
[18:49:05] <ML74> i'm planning on making this an iOS app in the future - which will be a lot easier - but it needs to be web now to support android too
[18:51:12] <ML74> looking at data tables - could maybe use data tables and forms :/
[18:52:54] <LindsayMac> ML74:  yea.. its made for that kinda stuff
[18:54:30] <ML74> http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/select_single_row.html
[18:54:46] <LindsayMac> ?
[18:55:01] <ML74> this, with a delete button on each row. but the delete button also triggers the form submit?
[18:55:25] <LindsayMac> ML74:  you can do whatever you want there
[18:55:39] <ML74> does that sound achievable?
[18:55:46] <LindsayMac> that particular example doesnt have the edit fields, but there are examples with it
[18:56:02] <ML74> i don't need edit fields :/
[18:56:19] <ML74> i can put a <select> box inside one of the cells
[18:56:21] <LindsayMac> ML74:  you said you needed to be able to update the number of guests that actually arrived .. right?
[18:56:31] <LindsayMac> ML74:  that is considered editing the table content
[18:56:38] <ML74> oh, really?
[18:57:15] <LindsayMac> well yes.. you have a tab cell with nothing and you're adding something.
[18:58:19] <ML74> oh, i thought you meant dynamically editable
[18:58:37] <LindsayMac> erm...
[18:58:39] <LindsayMac> what do you mean..
[19:02:38] <ML74> click the text, edit the cell
[19:03:06] <lindsayo> this slide effect is lame.
[19:03:20] <LindsayMac> ML74:  that is what you want to do...
[19:03:23] <LindsayMac> lindsayo:  LOL what?
[19:03:31] <lindsayo> It's not pretty.
[19:03:45] <LindsayMac> add easing ?
[19:03:55] <ML74> LinsdayMac: no, it's not
[19:03:56] <LindsayMac> i've still not answered my question...
[19:04:08] <ML74> keyboard doesn't come into it
[19:04:23] <ML74> it's a form input
[19:04:26] <LindsayMac> ML74:  it doesn't matter. You are editing a cell in a table and saving it right there
[19:04:32] <ML74> a drop down <select> box
[19:04:36] <lindsayo> the ajax-loaded element isn't easing in.
[19:04:38] <LindsayMac> text / select/ bool they are all the same essentially
[19:04:38] <lindsayo> it's just appearing.
[19:04:52] <ML74> ok
[19:04:54] <lindsayo> I told the content area to slide left, and the ajax loaded area to slide left.
[19:05:02] <lindsayo> They should just slide over so one replaces the other.
[19:05:21] <lindsayo> but the ajax loaded element pops up a bit after the content has gone.
[19:05:22] <LindsayMac> link?
[19:05:42] <LindsayMac> maybe you just have to play with delays and offsets
[19:05:55] <lindsayo> yeah, that's what I'm gonna try next.
[19:06:20] <lindsayo> and closing the black box isn't working on my iphone
[19:06:48] <lindsayo> ah, b/c the target is too small.
[19:06:54] <lindsayo> if I zoom in to tap, it works.
[20:16:38] <buddyq> hi everyone, I was looking at wrap() function for what I need but it wraps array of found elements. I have this struture <a><cufon><cufon></a> and I would like to inject a <strong> to wrap everything after the <a> like: <a><strong><cufon><cufon></strong></a>.
[20:16:52] <buddyq> Can someone suggest a way to do this?
[20:41:35] <oojacoboo> is there any way to trigger contentEditable?
[20:42:19] <oojacoboo> I have a situation where I'm clicking an element for content editable and it's not showing the cursor… it's kind of depending on where I click in the element, but strangely enough, when I click where there is text, it's not getting enabled
[20:42:36] <shoky> buddyq: there's .wrapInner() and .wrapAll() too
[20:42:55] <oojacoboo> it's pretty strange, I'm doing some class changes on the element and such on focus(), and setting empty(), but nothing too crazy
[20:43:21] <buddyq> I just tried wrapall. Almost worked but did some weird stuff. I had to actually run it from console since I think cufon is messing with the order things are getting fired.
[20:43:41] <oojacoboo> here is a gist… https://gist.github.com/fdb7a236d49911cad4d3
[21:28:18] <martisj> morning
[21:28:35] <lindsayo> no no, it's still evening.
[21:28:42] <lindsayo> late though it is.
[21:28:51] <tw2113> depends on where martisj is from
[21:29:11] <lindsayo> :P
[21:29:19] <Cork> 06:30 is morning enough in my book ;P
[21:29:20] <martisj> words of wisdom
[21:29:28] <martisj> 14.30 here
[21:29:29] <martisj> :)
[21:29:49] * tw2113 is from pluto anyway
[21:29:54] <Cork> lol
[21:30:06] <Cork> tw2113: you like the gift they sent you?
[21:30:23] <Cork> i hope it didn't smash your garden
[21:30:56] <tw2113> i'm envious of mars
[21:31:16] <Cork> for all the attention its getting? :D
[21:31:40] <tw2113> but of course
[21:32:31] <tw2113> hmmm Starbucks is going with Square
[21:33:01] <oojacoboo> anyone familiar with .focus() causing the cursor to lose itself within contentEditable in an element
[21:33:18] <oojacoboo> it appears that the :focus() is maintained, since the css stays, but the contentEditable does not
[21:33:28] <oojacoboo> ugh… .empty() rather ^^
[21:33:44] <Cork> oojacoboo: ya, contentEditable is a little frickel
[21:33:49] <oojacoboo> yea :/
[21:33:58] <oojacoboo> any idea on some hacks to regain the cursor?
[21:34:12] <oojacoboo> I can't use focus() b/c that's the event used to actually set everything up
[21:34:20] <Cork> its normally a rendering bug in the browser
[21:34:21] <oojacoboo> but I basically have some dummy text in there I empty on focus
[21:34:31] <Cork> so what you need to do depends on the browser
[21:34:55] <oojacoboo> I've seen some scattered things to that regard
[21:35:00] <oojacoboo> sounds nasty
[21:35:06] <Cork> it is
[21:35:17] <oojacoboo> bah
[21:35:23] <Cork> fixing rendering bugs are always nasty
[21:35:43] <oojacoboo> it's weird though, I can tab to the element and the js fires fine
[21:35:49] <oojacoboo> it's the click that causes the issue
[21:35:59] <lotus> who fixes rendering bugs?  Just leave them in the production release.
[21:36:07] <oojacoboo> might try disabling that event and seeing how I come out
[21:36:40] <lotus> oojacoboo: can I see it in a jsfiddle?
[21:37:24] <oojacoboo> unfortunately that'd take me a long time to build out
[21:37:26] <lotus> it sounds like something I can't help you with, but I'd be happy to try :)
[21:37:34] <lotus> oojacoboo: okay, yeah then don't :D
[21:38:27] <Cork> oojacoboo: have you tried something like disabling contentEditable and enabling it again?
[21:38:46] <oojacoboo> Cork, I've been looking for that event...
[21:38:48] <Cork> (you prob need to do this with a timer event so the browser gets to draw inbetween
[21:38:51] <oojacoboo> what is it??
[21:39:03] <Cork> domelm.contentEditable = false
[21:39:10] <oojacoboo> mmm
[21:39:12] <oojacoboo> interesting
[21:39:20] <oojacoboo> thanks, I'll give that a go
[21:39:46] <Cork> so; domelm.contentEditable = false; setTimeout(function() { domelm.contentEditable = true; }, 0);
[21:40:03] <oojacoboo> yep
[21:40:17] <oojacoboo> checking out this click event right now
[21:40:19] <oojacoboo> then that
[21:40:48] <oojacoboo> I can tab from one "tag" to the next and it works great with the empty() and maintaining contentEditable and focus
[21:41:06] <oojacoboo> it's when you click with the mouse and ONLY when you click where there is actual text that it doesn't work
[21:41:16] <oojacoboo> clicking in the element's padding still works :/
[21:43:28] <Atty> say i have a table with user data. And I want to put a modal form to edit eash users data. How do I pass the userid to the modal?
[21:50:17] <oojacoboo> Cork, that's only alters the attr value
[21:50:26] <oojacoboo> it doesn't affect any behaviort
[21:51:07] <Cork> it needs to be done on the dom element, not the jquery one or with attr
[21:51:41] <oojacoboo> $("#element").get(0).contentEditable = true; //no?
[21:52:01] <Cork> i would go with [0].contentEditable but ya
[21:52:24] <oojacoboo> right, but that just changes the attr value
[21:52:32] <Cork> it shouldn't
[21:52:36] <oojacoboo> mmm
[21:52:56] <Cork> that said, it was a few months since i last fiddled with contentEditable
[21:52:57] <digs> Is there something like jquery ui dialog that would have a textbox for users to enter text in?
[21:53:25] <Cork> digs: jquery ui dialog with a textarea or input in it?
[21:53:36] <digs> heh
[21:53:41] <digs> I see.
[21:53:55] <digs> Thanks. With a question like that I should probably go to bed.
[21:55:43] <digs> oh. I also didn't see they have a modal form.
[21:55:53] <oojacoboo> Cork, fixed :)
[21:56:58] <oojacoboo> $.mousedown(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).focus(); });
[21:57:22] <oojacoboo> where a focus() event function is set to handle the behavior
[21:57:35] <Cork> heh
[21:57:47] <oojacoboo> :)
[21:57:48] <Cork> scary, but looks ok :)
[21:57:55] <oojacoboo> not really that bad though
[21:58:07] <oojacoboo> clicking a contentEditable isn't really that important of an event
[21:58:11] <oojacoboo> the focus is all I need
[22:05:58] <Cork> oojacoboo: btw http://jsfiddle.net/ruBxs/1/
[22:13:39] <oojacoboo> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/ruBxs/3/
[22:13:43] <oojacoboo> I dunno wtf is up there
[22:13:48] <oojacoboo> was trying to show you a case
[22:15:35] <Cork> oojacoboo: your triggering a blur event in the focus event
[22:15:41] <Cork> aka: don't use alert
[22:15:55] <oojacoboo> I tried without
[22:15:57] <oojacoboo> wasn't working
[22:16:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ruBxs/5/
[22:16:10] <Cork> you had an error in there too
[22:16:17] <oojacoboo> oh, that was it then
[22:16:47] <oojacoboo> Cork, so, click on the text, then click anywhere but the text
[22:16:50] <oojacoboo> watch the cursor
[22:17:03] <Cork> wfm
[22:17:12] <Cork> what browser does this happen in?
[22:17:18] <oojacoboo> Chrome Canary for me
[22:17:23] <oojacoboo> maybe others?
[22:18:01] <Cork> wfm in firefox 17 and chrome 18
[22:18:12] <Cork> correction chromium 18
[22:18:25] <oojacoboo> you clicked on the text in the div and you still saw the blinking cursor?
[22:18:36] <Cork> sure
[22:18:50] <oojacoboo> are you sure sure… not that just the text disappeared and focus set?
[22:19:19] <Cork> the text is removed and then i can enter text just as normal with a caret
[22:19:36] <oojacoboo> when clicking right on top of the default text that's removed?
[22:20:00] <Cork> yup
[22:20:18] <oojacoboo> well it doesn't work in Chrome 22
[22:20:43] <Cork> though sometimes chrome doesn't set the focus when i click the text
[22:20:49] <Cork> so i need to click twice, but not always
[22:21:03] <oojacoboo> well, that would be what I'm prob talking about
[22:21:16] <Cork> while theres no focus i can't enter text either
[22:21:20] <Cork> so...
[22:21:21] <oojacoboo> you're prob not clicking right on top of the text, which does it for me every time
[22:21:25] <oojacoboo> right
[22:21:33] <oojacoboo> but the :focus is still set
[22:21:36] <oojacoboo> check the css
[22:22:11] <Cork> interesting
[22:22:15] <Cork> so it is
[22:22:36] <oojacoboo> yea
[22:22:45] <Cork> remember to make the fix crome specific then, cause its only there that its happens
[22:22:51] <Cork> *chrome
[22:23:04] <Cork> though, it doens't always happen here
[22:23:28] <oojacoboo> was happening for me every single time if you click right on top of the text
[22:23:37] <Cork> but theres definitely a focus bug in chromium/chrome
[22:23:38] <oojacoboo> in my case I'm using a span which made it very clear
[22:24:00] <Cork> oojacoboo: time to file a bug :)
[22:24:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ruBxs/7/
[22:24:04] <oojacoboo> heh
[22:24:43] <Cork> hmm, just thought of something
[22:24:51] <oojacoboo> what's that
[22:25:31] <Cork> oojacoboo: btw never do div#id
[22:25:43] <oojacoboo> whys that?
[22:25:43] <Cork> thats a waist of a perfectly good selector
[22:25:56] <oojacoboo> you mean redundant?
[22:25:56] <Cork> cause you first select all divs on the page then look for an id on them
[22:26:09] <Cork> instead of just going for the id hash and grabbing the element
[22:26:09] <oojacoboo> aka, not using the index?
[22:26:14] <Cork> ya
[22:26:23] <oojacoboo> gotcha, I didn't think it worked in that order
[22:26:29] <oojacoboo> I thought it was more of the reverse
[22:26:46] <oojacoboo> index, find divs then match
[22:27:10] <oojacoboo> not that that would necessarily make a whole lot of sense with an index
[22:27:27] <Cork> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/ruBxs/9/
[22:27:37] <oojacoboo> cool
[22:27:48] <Cork> a none jquery test, its always nice when its simplified as much as possible
[22:28:14] <oojacoboo> except it's a jquery bug :P
[22:28:20] <Cork> oojacoboo: no its not
[22:28:21] <oojacoboo> it works now
[22:28:31] <Cork> opps
[22:28:36] <Cork> no its my code thats broken
[22:28:44] <Cork> hmm wonder why...
[22:28:47] <oojacoboo> doesn't look broken to me :))
[22:28:53] <oojacoboo> looks fixed
[22:29:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ruBxs/10/
[22:29:16] <Cork> i always miss spell listener as listner --'
[22:29:23] <oojacoboo> oh, it wasn't clearing the text, duh
[22:29:28] <oojacoboo> heh
[22:29:45] <oojacoboo> cool, I'll file something
[22:30:38] <coldhead> glistner
[22:34:24] <oojacoboo> Cork, https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=141325
[22:34:44] <Cork> oojacoboo: thx
[22:35:01] <oojacoboo> fo sho :)
[22:35:26] <Cork> you didn't add the fail/ok info though :)
[22:35:36] <oojacoboo> I didn't check any of those
[22:35:45] <oojacoboo> ff 4.x :/
[22:35:56] <oojacoboo> dont' have access it IE around here
[22:36:46] <Cork> well the test is nonie compatible so...
[22:36:54] <Cork> (doesn't use attachEvent)
[22:37:04] <Cork> but it works fine in ff4+
[22:37:24] <Cork> hmm correction, it works fine in ie9
[22:37:35] <Cork> but not in ie<=8
[22:37:40] <oojacoboo> not in safari
[22:37:47] <oojacoboo> Webkit issue I guess
[22:37:52] <Cork> so its a webkit bug
[22:37:53] <Cork> ya
[22:38:32] <Cork> INTERESTING! :D
[22:38:38] <Cork> its broken in opera too >_>
[22:38:45] <Cork> exactly the same bug
[22:38:59] <oojacoboo> heh
[22:39:05] <oojacoboo> opera what version?
[22:39:18] <Cork> 11.something
[22:39:24] <Cork> i'm updating to 12 right now
[22:39:35] <oojacoboo> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=141325
[22:39:41] <oojacoboo> updated with tests
[22:40:12] <Cork> yup exactly the same bug in opera 12.01
[22:40:24] <Cork> build 1532
[22:40:41] <oojacoboo> Opera isn't webkit though, right?
[22:40:41] <Cork> so they have parity opera :D
[22:40:45] <Cork> nope
[22:40:51] <oojacoboo> it's their own engine
[22:41:21] <oojacoboo> someone is copying each other's code :P
[22:41:28] <Cork> opera is presto
[22:41:38] <Cork> firefox, and all the like is gecko
[22:41:42] <Cork> ie is trident
[22:41:42] <oojacoboo> right
[22:41:45] <oojacoboo> yep
[22:41:53] <oojacoboo> presto, couldn't recall that one
[22:42:34] <Cork> oojacoboo: i'm guessing they've choosen to handle some form of web bug the same way giving this the result
[22:43:15] <Cork> presto is closed source so its not likely its copied (that would be illegal)
[22:43:21] <oojacoboo> it's curious for sure
[22:43:38] <rhino__> how can I prepend to an h3 within a div of a specific id?  here is what I have so far:       $("#question-" + reqarray[i]).prepend("<span style = 'float:left;color:red;'>*</span>");
[22:43:43] <oojacoboo> doesn't mean they aren't reading the webkit business logic ;)
[22:44:13] <Cork> rhino__:  $("#question-" + reqarray[i] + ' div')
[22:44:44] <Cork> oojacoboo: that would actually still make it illegal
[22:45:58] <rhino__> Cork:  I'm trying to prepend to an h3 that is within the "#question-" + reqarray[i] div, so would I just change that to ' h3' from ' div' ?
[22:45:59] <Cork> webkit is lgpl, so if presto used its code it would have to be converted to lgpl == the source code published
[22:46:15] <oojacoboo> I see
[22:46:22] <Cork> rhino__: yes
[22:46:30] <oojacoboo> but that doesn't mean they didn't read it to get some ideas ;)
[22:46:39] <Cork> oojacoboo: thats the same thing
[22:46:54] <Cork> its called tainting
[22:47:08] <oojacoboo> well, let's just assume that didn't happen then :P
[22:47:13] <Cork> :)
[22:47:45] <Cork> your free to reimplement the same result, but not read the code
[22:48:04] <Cork> (thats the difference between copyright and patent)
[22:48:36] <oojacoboo> makes sense
[22:48:52] <oojacoboo> my OSS knowledge is pretty sparce
[22:49:22] <Cork> what do you mean?
[22:49:28] <oojacoboo> in terms of the licenses
[22:50:01] <Cork> well gpl and lgpl is a bit special
[22:50:14] <Cork> apache and mpl is another matter
[22:50:50] <Cork> apache is more or less "you may not sue me, other then that, do what you like" :D
[22:50:52] <oojacoboo> right, I can't speak much to them, just haven't dove into that too much
[22:51:33] <oojacoboo> sounds like MIT
[22:52:20] <Cork> might be, haven't seen mit much
[22:52:29] <oojacoboo> http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
[22:53:04] <Cork> its closer to bsd, so no apache is more easy going
[22:53:11] <coldhead> http://benalman.com/news/2010/02/on-licensing-my-code/
[22:53:17] <Cork> bsd is a kinda "you may not have any other god then me" :)
[22:53:26] <oojacoboo> ha
[22:54:06] <Cork> so bsd licenses is hard to use in conjunction with other licenses
[22:54:22] <Cork> (though gpl is MUCH harder)
[22:54:41] <Cork> as it actively converts your license to gpl what ever you used before
[22:58:55] <oojacoboo> what would be the best way of serializing the text within … <ul><li><span></li><li>...
[22:59:19] <oojacoboo> can you just select the span and serialize() or do I need to loop over that creating my own serialzed string?
[22:59:58] <oojacoboo> assuming I want the text within the <span>
[23:00:00] <Cork> serialize it to what?
[23:00:07] <oojacoboo> for a url
[23:00:18] <Cork> you mean grabbing just the text?
[23:00:27] <oojacoboo> right, but for like 10 of them
[23:00:31] <oojacoboo> or as many as there are
[23:00:41] <Cork> one for each li?
[23:00:49] <oojacoboo> the span for each li, right
[23:01:18] <Cork> $('ul li').each(function() { $(this).text() })
[23:01:30] <Cork> or map if you want it as an array
[23:02:08] <oojacoboo> so you're saying I need to loop, serialize and add concatenate to string?
[23:02:31] <Cork> if you want the url's as separat strings yes
[23:02:40] <Cork> but not sure why you feel you need to serialize
[23:02:51] <oojacoboo> well, I guess I don't need to serialize
[23:03:23] <oojacoboo> but without, It's going to have to have a comma passed between each at least, no?
[23:03:29] <Cork> var urls = $.map($('ul li'), function(elm) { return $(elm).text() })
[23:04:02] <Cork> what is it you want to do with the urls?
[23:04:05] <oojacoboo> so that's an array of text() contents there… then I could serializeArray
[23:04:10] <oojacoboo> POST
[23:04:17] <Cork> oojacoboo: not really
[23:04:23] <Cork> serialize expectes form elements
[23:04:31] <Cork> and you have spans
[23:04:45] <Cork> you could do something like
[23:04:52] <oojacoboo> basically I just wanna url_encode em :)
[23:05:01] <Cork> var param = { urls: $.map($('ul li'), function(elm) { return $(elm).text() }) }
[23:05:18] <Cork> and then use param for your ajax or what ever your doing
[23:05:31] <oojacoboo> mm
[23:06:01] <Cork> that would generate urls[]=url&urls[]=url&urls[]=url&urls[]=url&urls[]=url&urls[]=url
[23:06:08] <oojacoboo> oh, I see
[23:06:36] <Cork> $.ajax converts objects to params by its self
[23:06:46] <oojacoboo> ah
[23:06:55] <Cork> if your not using ajax you need to give it to $.params(param)
[23:07:19] <rhino__> I am trying to run the following jquery code in a function, but I keep getting a 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null' error msg.  Here is the code snippet:  $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $("#question-" + reqarray[i] + " h3").offset().top}, 1000);
[23:07:26] <oojacoboo> would it not be $("ul li span") ?
[23:07:50] <wookiehangover> rhino__: offset() is undefined
[23:08:02] <wookiehangover> probably because your selector doesn't match anything
[23:08:03] <Cork> rhino__: you need to make sure the selector works
[23:08:59] <Cork> yup
[23:09:19] <rhino__> wookiehangover, Cork:  I knoe the selector is working b/c I am prepending to it, but then when I try to scroll to it, it gives me that error msg.  By the way, how would I define the offset?
[23:09:27] <Cork> oojacoboo: unless you have other text beside the urls in the li's its not needed
[23:09:44] <oojacoboo> it strips all the elements?
[23:09:45] <Cork> oojacoboo: but ya, if you have more text in there then the url, and the span separates it sure
[23:09:46] <wookiehangover> rhino__: console.log( $("#question-" + reqarray[i] + " h3").offset() )
[23:09:48] <Cork> yes
[23:09:53] <wookiehangover> is probably undefined
[23:09:55] <oojacoboo> yea, there are anchors too :)
[23:09:56] <Cork> ?.text @ oojacoboo
[23:09:57] <bot-t> oojacoboo, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[23:10:09] <wookiehangover> ergo, console.log( $("#question-" + reqarray[i] + " h3").length )
[23:10:13] <wookiehangover> is probably 0
[23:10:18] <wookiehangover> thus,
[23:10:25] <wookiehangover> no matching selector
[23:11:06] <rhino__> wookiehangover:  where do I run that line of code?
[23:11:26] <wookiehangover> immediately before the line that breaks shit
[23:12:11] <rhino__> in chrome or where?
[23:12:21] <rhino__> or in actual code
[23:12:23] <wookiehangover> ?ftj
[23:12:23] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[23:13:28] <wookiehangover> rhino__: exactly what I said, "immediately *before* the line (like, the line in your code) that breaks (the thing that's throwing the error) [...]"
[23:14:17] <coldhead> i prefer console.warn() to console.log() because it makes my debugging seem more dramatic
[23:14:35] <wookiehangover> console.suggest()
[23:15:10] <rhino__> wookiehangover, it comes up as null
[23:15:26] <wookiehangover> which means your selector doesn't match anything

[23:15:33] <coldhead> BAM
[23:16:15] <scathen^C> hey all, i am building a toolbar for a wysiwyg editor im making. is there any links for design inspiration? what about menu icons like bold/italid/link chains/etc?

[23:17:22] <rhino__> wookiehangover: made a stupid mistake and was using the iteration var, i.e. [i] instead of [0] in my code.  Thanks!!!
[23:17:35] <coldhead> great work everyone, take five
[23:17:40] <wookiehangover> \:D/
[23:18:22] * tw2113 protests by taking six
[23:19:17] <coldhead> you're off the team, tw2113
[23:19:31] <coldhead> you're not really, you're our pinch hitter
[23:19:34] <coldhead> whatever that is
[23:19:34] <tw2113> :O i was on it?
[23:49:51] <coldhead> what punishment does code like this deserve? http://jsfiddle.net/Cq3KY/
[23:51:16] <juha_> coldhead: night with you should be punishment enough
[23:51:36] <tw2113> i can think of worse people to spend a night with
[23:51:37] <coldhead> i wrote that code
[23:51:45] <coldhead> i spend every night with me
[23:51:52] <tw2113> US Congress for one
[23:52:06] <Cork> coldhead: why are you going the long way around sort?
[23:53:07] <juha_> coldhead: not sure if you wrote that code because you spend nights with yourself or if you're spending nights with yourself because of that code..
[23:53:19] <Cork> lol
[23:53:23] <coldhead> Cork: why am i doing anything
[23:53:32] <coldhead> i don't even know
[23:53:41] <tw2113> what is doing?
[23:53:45] <coldhead> i just looked back at my screen, saw that horror and thought "better share that with jQuery"
[23:53:46] <Cork> coldhead: why do planets rotate
[23:53:47] <tw2113> is that a new method?
[23:54:01] <coldhead> it's horrible unreadable code
[23:54:05] <coldhead> i don't think that's a new thing
[23:54:25] <Cork> tw2113: it randomizes a selection of elements and picks the first one
[23:54:58] <rhino__> what would cause an 'object has no method replace error'?
[23:55:15] <juha_> rhino__: object which has no replace
[23:55:18] <Cork> rhino__: your runing replace on something thats not a string
[23:55:30] <jaket> its not unreadable if you know javascript
[23:55:48] <tw2113> function its_it() { return true; } if(its_it()) { echo "What is it?"; }
[23:55:54] <Cork> jaket: but its fairly easy to write it more readable
[23:55:57] <juha_> rhino__: console.log your object, most likely undefined, happens all the time
[23:56:34] <Cork> it might actually be something else too
[23:56:36] <rhino__> Cork:  so I assume I just need to cast it as a string
[23:56:44] <Cork> like a dom object or something like that
[23:56:54] <Cork> rhino__: depends, what is it?
[23:57:09] <Cork> and what are you trying to do
[23:57:50] * ENQ is away: I'm busy
[23:57:58] * ENQ is back (gone 00:00:04)
[23:58:00] <Cork> ENQ: please turn that of
[23:58:07] <Cork> *off
[23:58:36] <ENQ> how?
[23:58:38] <rhino__> Cork:  It's a string(or at least what I thought is a string) that is being passed to a function and then I'm running a replace to remove all spaces
[23:58:50] <Cork> ENQ: its your client, look in its options
[23:59:01] <Cork> its an "away message"
[23:59:04] <ENQ> and what to turn of?
[23:59:14] <Cork> * ENQ is away: I'm busy <--
[23:59:28] <ENQ> oh
[23:59:33] <ENQ> sorry
[23:59:44] <Cork> rhino__: well, then you need to check what it is
