[00:00:50] <axscode> im really new to jquery, i wanted to make a jquery function that activated in images that resides/children of <div id="menu_tags"> <img id="child1_menu" > ... </div>
[00:01:17] <coldhead> let me help you with the specific first
[00:01:33] <coldhead> then we'll deal with the DOM complexishness
[00:01:55] <PoPSiCLe> okay... so how exactly would I add a log of the data-variable within the function?
[00:02:03] <PoPSiCLe> it doesn't seem to add anything
[00:02:10] <PoPSiCLe> which probably means I did it wrong :)
[00:02:28] <sacho> you need the function to execute for the logging to happen
[00:02:39] <PoPSiCLe> the function executes
[00:02:42] <PoPSiCLe> the alert box shows up
[00:02:53] <sacho> do you have the console opened?
[00:03:25] <PoPSiCLe> currently it's like this: function(data) { console.log(data + "test"); if (data.length != 0 ) { alert(data) } }
[00:03:36] <PoPSiCLe> I guess that might be wrong syntax?
[00:03:56] <coldhead> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/
[00:04:13] <coldhead> that's a function that swaps the img src with the img altsrc on hover
[00:04:39] <coldhead> PoPSiCLe: console.log(data, 'test')
[00:04:49] <coldhead> data + test forces data to be a string, and maybe it isn't
[00:04:58] <PoPSiCLe> hm, ok
[00:05:11] <axscode> $('img').hover(function () {  <-- thanks but this one gets all img, any img right?  how about only images under <div id="menu_wrap">  all images here only </div>
[00:05:42] <sacho> #menu_wrap > img
[00:06:06] <sacho> the syntax for selectors is in the documentation. :)
[00:06:11] <coldhead> see above, axscode, i said i'd help you with the hover first
[00:06:29] <coldhead> then i'll let sacho make everything wonderful :)
[00:06:33] <Genesis730> can you store a class ID in a variable and use that variable to animate that class?
[00:06:43] <coldhead> sure Genesis730
[00:06:55] <Genesis730> i can't get it work :(... this is what I got.
[00:07:02] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/1/
[00:07:05] <PoPSiCLe> this is... weird....
[00:07:07] <coldhead> you can't use the word class for your var :)
[00:07:20] <PoPSiCLe> when I changed to (data, 'test') instead
[00:07:25] <PoPSiCLe> it all of a sudden worked
[00:07:34] <PoPSiCLe> the 'test'-bit showed up in console
[00:07:39] <PoPSiCLe> and the alert did NOT trigger
[00:07:47] <Genesis730> var spanID = $(this).attr("id");  $("#spanID").animate    I tried using alert to see if the variable parsed or not, maybe bad syntax??
[00:07:55] <PoPSiCLe> *confused*
[00:07:57] <coldhead> axscode: http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/2/
[00:08:04] <coldhead> sacho told you what to do
[00:08:19] <coldhead> PoPSiCLe: wanna get this weirdness up on jsfiddle?
[00:08:26] <coldhead> because it works fine when i run it in my head
[00:08:33] <sacho> Genesis730: there's no variable interpolation in strings
[00:08:34] <Genesis730> things usually do :(
[00:08:39] <PoPSiCLe> yeah, it worked fine in my head too... :)
[00:08:40] <sacho> $("#" + spanID)
[00:08:44] <Genesis730> :)
[00:09:10] <PoPSiCLe> coldhead:  I can just remove the function(data) altogether, it's just a debug tool
[00:09:10] <coldhead> i would be 2 years younger if JS had variable interpolation
[00:09:12] <axscode> coldhead: demmit, thats genius...  imma lovin jquery
[00:09:29] <PoPSiCLe> it's just... weird
[00:09:38] <coldhead> axscode: next move the width/height stuff to css :)
[00:09:40] <Genesis730> LOL coldhead
[00:10:00] <axscode> style="" thats good.. so i have one more problem with this...
[00:10:05] <Genesis730> I'm more of a PHP mastermind :P jQuery / JS is fairly new so having trouble gettin used to the differences
[00:10:07] <axscode> ill write it down..
[00:11:01] <coldhead> Genesis730: welcome home?
[00:11:03] <coldhead> it'll get better
[00:11:17] <Genesis730> haha thanks
[00:11:19] <coldhead> the main thing to embrace in moving from PHP to JS is anonymous functions
[00:11:20] <Genesis730> i'm sure it will
[00:11:31] <coldhead> you're almost certainly not using them enough
[00:11:46] <coldhead> then closures
[00:11:55] <coldhead> then have some chocolate
[00:12:04] <PoPSiCLe> coldhead: seems there was something wrong with the upload or cache on the page - reloaded now, without the console.log-bit, and it works just fine
[00:12:22] <coldhead> PoPSiCLe: then let us never speak of these troubled times again
[00:12:25] <coldhead> onward and upward!
[00:12:26] <PoPSiCLe> lol
[00:12:30] <PoPSiCLe> indeed
[00:12:37] <Genesis730> 1 more thing if i may... i also have if (span.text() == 1) {  but it targets the first span rather than the one being clicked, how could I incorporate that into targeting the correct span?
[00:13:11] <coldhead> $(this).text, Genesis730
[00:13:19] <coldhead> er
[00:13:20] <coldhead> text()
[00:13:22] <Genesis730> it's a callback function, doesn't seem to work :(
[00:13:28] <coldhead> if the click is ACTUALLY on a span
[00:13:44] <Genesis730> it is, it's an image with a class ID that increments (via PHP)
[00:13:50] <Genesis730> so each one is unique
[00:14:01] <coldhead> can i see the code?
[00:14:08] <coldhead> i'm struggling to picture it
[00:14:14] <coldhead> the stuff PHP has shat out, pls
[00:14:20] <coldhead> i don't wanna see no <?
[00:14:26] <Genesis730> HAHA
[00:14:34] <Genesis730> the file is the js file
[00:14:46] <coldhead> link link link
[00:14:51] <wokkawokka> jfiddler it
[00:15:19] <Genesis730> let me try the $(this).text() real fast before i waste anyones time :P
[00:15:27] <coldhead> don't say jsfiddler, wokkawokka, it attracts paedophiles to the site
[00:15:43] <Genesis730> yeah... that made everything stop working
[00:15:50] <PoPSiCLe> *headdesk*
[00:16:07] <wokkawokka> really coldhead, didn't know they troll the jquery channel...
[00:16:40] <Genesis730> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/fuUKn/
[00:17:01] <coldhead> that URL looks obscene >: |
[00:17:18] <wokkawokka> hahaha....nice touch
[00:17:20] <Genesis730> that's what she said ;)
[00:17:43] <coldhead> lol
[00:17:55] <coldhead> Genesis730: why does this span comparison stuff have to happen in the callback?
[00:18:09] <Genesis730> cause :P idki
[00:18:11] <Genesis730> idk*
[00:18:13] <coldhead> span isn't being changed by the getJSON call
[00:18:30] <Genesis730> no but the span is different depending on what is clicked
[00:18:42] <coldhead> hmm >_>
[00:18:51] <Genesis730> and each span has 4 numbers which describe it's location and state
[00:19:11] <coldhead> this sounds terribly gomblicated
[00:19:34] <Genesis730> vey gomblicated indeed...
[00:19:48] <Genesis730> it's not bad working with the PHP that i do
[00:19:53] <Genesis730> i thought it was the simpest approach
[00:19:57] <Genesis730> simplest*
[00:20:27] <coldhead> i prefer to associate elements in the page by wrapping them in something
[00:20:35] <coldhead> so you can treat grouped items as siblings
[00:20:44] <coldhead> but that may not be appropriate here
[00:21:03] <coldhead> why don't you try console.log(span) just after you define it and again inside the callback
[00:21:08] <coldhead> to see what's going on
[00:21:52] <coldhead> although it really looks to me like you could move the span.stuff() out of the callback altogether
[00:21:52] <Genesis730> after i define what again?
[00:22:03] <coldhead> i'll type it up, bro
[00:22:12] <coldhead> anything for you, phil collins
[00:22:13] <Genesis730> well how would it update the page?
[00:22:16] <Genesis730> or where would it go?
[00:22:24] <Genesis730> it has to change only when it's successful
[00:22:33] <Genesis730> so the JSON has to execute and update the DB
[00:22:50] <coldhead> ah okay
[00:22:55] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/fuUKn/1/
[00:22:56] <Genesis730> upon completion without error, it should change the text from on or off and flash green or red :)
[00:22:59] <coldhead> that's the debuggy way
[00:24:08] <Genesis730> sorry if i'm bein a noob :P lovin what jQuery can do but google can only provide so much with 3 days experience
[00:24:10] <Genesis730> :(
[00:24:26] <coldhead> don't be glum, chum!
[00:24:28] <coldhead> it's gonna be okay
[00:24:42] <coldhead> here's the "move shit out of the callback" approach
[00:24:45] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/fuUKn/3/
[00:24:48] <Genesis730> haha so what did that do?
[00:25:04] <coldhead> Genesis730: that just logs span to the console at 2 points
[00:25:11] <coldhead> so you can peer at them and see what's what
[00:25:23] <Genesis730> well i mean i clickedsomethin and i see no log :P where is it saved?
[00:25:34] <coldhead> firebug in firefox
[00:25:40] <coldhead> web inspector in chrome
[00:25:47] <coldhead> IE you are banned from this channel for life
[00:25:47] <Genesis730> i got me firebug :)
[00:25:56] <coldhead> cool, check the console tab
[00:26:35] <coldhead> i gotta tend to laundry, i will pray for you Genesis730
[00:26:41] <axscode> ok for me this real hard, this is what i want to attain.. -> http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/5/
[00:26:41] <Genesis730> i see [span#span-0]
[00:27:36] <coldhead> you should see 2 of those, Genesis730
[00:27:41] <Genesis730> just 1
[00:27:59] <Genesis730> if i click the other image i get [span#span-1]
[00:28:00] <coldhead> so maybe the getJSON callback isn't happening?
[00:28:12] <coldhead> try making the logs slightly different
[00:28:21] <coldhead> console.log('pre-callback', span)
[00:28:29] <coldhead> and console.log('inside callback', span)
[00:28:35] <coldhead> so you can tell which you're looking at
[00:29:12] <Genesis730> so add another console.log(span); after if(data.change);?
[00:29:23] <coldhead> no, the 2 you have are plenty
[00:29:30] <Genesis730> i only have 1
[00:29:35] <coldhead> wtf
[00:29:38] <Genesis730> after the variable
[00:29:40] <coldhead> that's why you only see 1
[00:29:44] <coldhead> I WROTE TWO
[00:29:51] <Genesis730> OH i didn't see the second one :P
[00:29:55] <Genesis730> F*** me :P
[00:30:08] <coldhead> i am DEFINITELY going to attend to the laundry now
[00:30:10] <coldhead> GOOD LUCK
[00:30:11] <Genesis730> haha
[00:30:12] <Genesis730> thanks
[00:31:51] <Genesis730> well if anyone else who could follow would care to help :)
[00:34:00] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/5/  <-- yeah i tried, seems not working my regex is for perl, anyone knows how to convert this to java engine regex?
[00:43:57] <coldhead> Genesis730: where's it at
[00:44:09] <Genesis730> where's what at?
[00:44:17] <coldhead> your project
[00:44:22] <Genesis730> on my server :P
[00:44:30] <coldhead> -*-
[00:44:41] <Genesis730> i have the logs, just don't exactly don't know what i am lookin at
[00:44:41] <axscode_> http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/7/ <-- no luck at all..
[00:45:10] <coldhead> axscode_: try not to say "java" when you mean javascript, you'll upset people
[00:45:31] <coldhead> Genesis730: so both logs are firing?
[00:45:43] <coldhead> the callback is executing?
[00:45:54] <Genesis730> I read somewhere JavaScript is to Java as Fun is to Funeral :P
[00:46:03] <Genesis730> yes coldhead
[00:46:23] <coldhead> lol
[00:46:34] <Genesis730> i got [span#span-0]  then GET (url)  then another [span#span-0]
[00:46:43] <coldhead> axscode_: i can't read your regex, what is it trying to match?
[00:47:04] <coldhead> so it's working
[00:47:16] <coldhead> what's NOT working?
[00:47:43] <coldhead> try span.text('LOLOL EVERYTHING IS SO CRAZY') after the if (data.change)
[00:47:53] <coldhead> so it will happen unconditionally
[00:47:59] <axscode_> if i have this string  sites/all/files/magic.one.two.jpg  ---> it need to replace the last DOT to  "_hover." so it will looks like -> sites/all/files/magic.one.two_hover.jpg
[00:48:01] <Genesis730> regardless of which link i click, the first one that loads is what is changing in respect to the span.text(0); deal, i need to target the class that's being clicked
[00:48:25] <coldhead> cool, thanks axscode_
[00:48:38] <axscode_> but, my regex is not working
[00:49:09] <axscode_> the previous i put in there is working in perl, on fiddle 6, but i tried the one you pasted for me, at fiddle 7
[00:49:57] <Genesis730> coldhead: here's what i'm working with http://i.imgur.com/4QWjd.jpg
[00:51:41] <coldhead> axscode_: http://jsfiddle.net/Rj48q/
[00:51:58] <coldhead> Genesis730: so the selector must be wrong...
[00:52:16] <Genesis730> i just think it's targeting the first span because there's multiple ones
[00:53:21] <Genesis730> i was looking to do something like spanID.text(0);  ?
[00:53:39] <Genesis730> that would target the span being clicked
[00:53:49] <coldhead> Genesis730: http://jsfiddle.net/fuUKn/4/
[00:54:06] <coldhead> check that anchor has the right values
[00:54:29] <Genesis730> kay
[00:54:37] <Genesis730> is what i'm attempting that difficult??
[00:54:44] <axscode_> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/Rj48q/1/ <-- i change the filename. the filename should be dynamic, i just added more DOTS in between so we need to detect the last dot.
[00:54:50] <coldhead> no but you're a massive noob, Genesis730
[00:54:52] <coldhead> you'll get better
[00:54:58] <Genesis730> HAHA
[00:55:00] <Genesis730>  IS EVERYTHING SANE? w-1-0-10-1 ["w", "1", "0", "10", "1"]
[00:55:01] <coldhead> if you're still hurting paste your HTML
[00:55:13] <coldhead> so i can see what's happening
[00:55:13] <Genesis730> got returned
[00:55:21] <coldhead> Genesis730: and does that look right?
[00:55:29] <Genesis730> that is the class
[00:55:36] <Genesis730> w-1-0-10-1
[00:56:39] <coldhead> axscode_: http://jsfiddle.net/Rj48q/2/
[00:57:47] <coldhead> Genesis730: http://jsfiddle.net/fuUKn/5/
[00:57:56] <coldhead> that will show you the selector it's actually using
[00:58:00] <coldhead> make sure that's sane
[00:58:20] <coldhead> then copy that selector from firebug, and try evaluating it at the firebug console
[00:58:27] <coldhead> $('stuff you paste')
[00:58:28] <coldhead> and
[00:58:33] <coldhead> $('stuff you paste').length
[00:58:48] <axscode_> wow, so this is it -> http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/11/  <-- only thing is, its not going back like onmouseout that it should change back the image to original
[00:59:14] <Genesis730> I AM USING #span-0 javascript  |    IS EVERYTHING SANE? w-0-0-10-0 ["w", "0", "0", "10", "0"]
[00:59:17] <axscode_> maybe because i changed the src and altsrc as the same filename
[00:59:27] <Genesis730> - the javascript...
[00:59:33] <Genesis730> I AM USING #span-0     |    IS EVERYTHING SANE? w-0-0-10-0 ["w", "0", "0", "10", "0"]
[01:00:01] <coldhead> Genesis730: and that looks right if you click on the first wrench, right?
[01:00:14] <Genesis730> yes
[01:00:18] <coldhead> that has the id for span 0 and the selector is matching span 0
[01:00:20] <Genesis730> and it would be 1 on the second wrench
[01:00:36] <coldhead> but what is it REALLY on the 2nd wrench
[01:00:54] <coldhead> axscode_: yes, you either need to use two different functions, one to remove _hover and one to _add it
[01:01:07] <axscode_> lemme see what i can do..
[01:01:07] <coldhead> OR you can do something sneaky to cache the original, which i'll demo
[01:01:30] <Genesis730> second wrench     I AM USING #span-1    |    IS EVERYTHING SANE? w-1-0-10-1 ["w", "1", "0", "10", "1"]
[01:02:53] <coldhead> those really are the results you expect, Genesis730
[01:03:01] <coldhead> it's targeting different spans for different wrenchs
[01:03:07] <coldhead> axscode_: http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/15/
[01:03:20] <Genesis730> the numbers break down like this w = wrench 1 = loaded state   0 = row number   10 =  userID and 1 = wrench 0 or 1
[01:03:39] <Genesis730> those appear to be what i am expecting
[01:03:44] <axscode_> coldhead: thats great, but when you do it again, its not replacing the image...
[01:03:58] <coldhead> axscode_: so i see, wanna take a crack at fixing it?
[01:04:00] <axscode_> its like one time... maybe it does this _hover_hoveR_hover
[01:04:10] <coldhead> no that's what it was doing before
[01:04:50] <axscode_> oh.. ill crack my head for sure before i can crack it.. im trying hard in my side..
[01:08:03] <coldhead> axscode_: in the interests of getting you on your way, here is the 2 function version http://jsfiddle.net/yZ9eK/18/
[01:08:08] <juha_> coldhead: hey mister
[01:08:19] <coldhead> heya juha_, happy weekend
[01:08:25] <coldhead> you're up early for a drunkard
[01:08:33] <juha_> indeed
[01:08:42] <juha_> that's because my cat just pissed on my face
[01:08:51] <coldhead> Genesis730: if it's still bugging you paste the PHP you're dealing with so i can see what it's actually working on
[01:08:56] <coldhead> GUH
[01:09:04] <axscode_> such a genius,  first time i saw two function.. thanks a lot colhead
[01:09:04] <coldhead> paste the POST-PHP, the generated HTML*
[01:09:34] <coldhead> axscode_: hover will use the same function if it only receives one, otherwise it uses the first for mousein, the second for mouseout
[01:09:38] <coldhead> ?hover @ axscode_
[01:09:38] <bot-t> axscode_, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[01:09:45] <juha_> coldhead: check out my personal intertube portal cloud service 2.0 that i upgraded yesterday. juha.bin.fi <3
[01:10:01] <coldhead> FUTURIFIC, JUHA_ !
[01:10:15] <juha_> indeed!
[01:10:23] <axscode_> meaning there's an existing one?
[01:10:41] <Genesis730> http://pastebin.com/bsdUnRz2
[01:10:43] <coldhead> axscode_: read the docs :)
[01:10:55] <coldhead> juha_: this is awesome and terrifying
[01:11:02] <axscode_> thanks
[01:11:13] <coldhead> Genesis730: WE HAVE FOUND YOUR PROBLEM
[01:11:19] <coldhead> IDs must be unique :P
[01:11:19] <Genesis730> :D
[01:11:34] <coldhead> you can only have one #span-1 per page
[01:11:46] <coldhead> you probably need to change those to classes
[01:11:52] <coldhead> and change the # to . in your selectors
[01:11:58] <coldhead> AND EVERYBODY CAN GO HOME
[01:12:06] <coldhead> GREAT JOB EVERYONE
[01:12:12] <Genesis730> hahaha
[01:12:40] <coldhead> my god, juha_, this is the most minimal HTML i have ever seen
[01:12:52] <juha_> you lie
[01:12:56] <Genesis731> damn connection
[01:13:00] <Genesis731> so the selector...
[01:14:30] <juha_> coldhead: do you think that -webkit-animations would work on borders? i could do some really psychedelic borders to the image, would be cool
[01:15:01] <Genesis731> what exactly would I change again?? :)
[01:17:07] <Guest49479> Hi
[01:17:34] <Guest49479> Any body help me
[01:18:45] <Guest49479>  I am working on a project in struts 2 and mootools
[01:19:32] <Guest49479> I want to generate system notifications for the users how can i do that
[01:19:40] <alice_> I want to add table on ajax response. But table is not showing on ajax response only contents displayed.
[01:19:54] <alice_> Is there any way to display contents with table ?
[01:20:19] <alice_> Here is jquery and php code http://dpaste.com/616307/
[01:21:36] <coldhead> Genesis731: change the id= to class= in the HTML
[01:21:49] <coldhead> then change the #span- to .span- in the JS
[01:21:50] <Guest49479> in ajax response u generate the table dynamically and go on adding data to it
[01:22:03] <coldhead> and we have to change something else but i'll let you fix that when we get there
[01:22:27] <coldhead> Guest49479: this is #jQuery, i think you want #mootools
[01:22:37] <Guest49479> hey cold head please read my pboblem
[01:23:04] <coldhead> i read your fascinating it problem, it doesn't seem related to jQuery
[01:23:08] <coldhead> i only know jQuery
[01:23:11] <coldhead> jQuery and despair
[01:23:47] <coldhead> alice_: try html() instead of text()
[01:23:51] <coldhead> text() is just for text
[01:24:05] <Guest49479> no it will be great if u people give some soln in jquery
[01:24:07] <Genesis731> it's not changing the span.text() now :(
[01:24:30] <coldhead> Genesis731: your new problem is that there are MULTIPLE span-0s in the page
[01:24:34] <coldhead> and you need a specific one
[01:24:48] <coldhead> Genesis731: pastebin the html you're using now
[01:24:55] <coldhead> it's very nearly working, i promise
[01:25:00] <alice_> coldhead: I tried with html. but displaying same result
[01:25:02] <Genesis731> i just changed id to class
[01:25:18] <coldhead> Genesis731: show me :)
[01:26:02] <Genesis731> http://pastebin.com/jEpfvrWs
[01:26:46] <coldhead> alice_: http://jsfiddle.net/pXM3V/
[01:27:16] <coldhead> the JS is working fine, perhaps there is a problem with the data coming back from the server. do you have a live demo?
[01:27:49] <coldhead> Genesis731: and jsfiddle me the latest JS you are using
[01:28:29] <Genesis731> http://jsfiddle.net/A28Du/
[01:28:50] <alice_> coldhead:  yes I have live demo. just wait
[01:28:57] <coldhead> this still has #span, Genesis731
[01:29:00] <coldhead> it needs to be .span
[01:29:03] <coldhead> and one other thing
[01:29:30] <Guest49479> Hey  coldhead can u please help me how notifications are handled in facebook
[01:30:29] <coldhead> Guest49479: http://www.psdeluxe.com/articles/web-design/30-the-best-jquery-plugins-inspired-from-twitter-and-facebook/

[01:30:57] <Genesis731> and 1 other thing?
[01:31:01] <coldhead> if you have some actual code we can help you with it, but we can't just turn your dreams into code
[01:31:19] <coldhead> Genesis731: http://jsfiddle.net/A28Du/1/
[01:32:20] <Guest49479> Thanks coldhead
[01:32:45] <coldhead> we save a reference to the parent row, and use that to tell jquery "search within this row"
[01:33:34] <Genesis731> what line was changed?
[01:33:47] <coldhead> Genesis731: the lines with the spans
[01:33:59] <coldhead> hold up, i'll use the pastebin of the gods
[01:34:45] <alice_> coldhead: Here is live .please choose only text file for upload. http://www.beotranslation.com/test/

[01:36:28] <coldhead> why is data null!
[01:36:33] <Genesis731> idk :(
[01:36:35] <coldhead> did you change something else?
[01:36:42] <coldhead> okay maybe take a cigaratte break
[01:36:47] <coldhead> because it's so fn close
[01:36:48] <Genesis731> lol
[01:36:50] <alice_> coldhead: Its not creating any <tr><td> tag. just display plan text.
[01:37:14] <alice_> displaying*
[01:39:26] <Genesis731> i did not coldhead only id to class in the php page and just copied your edited JS file
[01:44:23] <coldhead> the wrench images can still be IDs because they're unique
[01:46:11] <alice_> coldhead: Alert box displaying the response in table format.

[01:46:55] <h32Lg> hi
[01:47:08] <coldhead> fuck yes, Genesis731, this should be good
[01:47:14] <Genesis731> still null :(
[01:47:18] <Genesis731> hang on
[01:47:22] <alice_> coldhead:  its live.
[01:48:19] <coldhead> Genesis731: check the call and response to the server in the firebug network console
[01:48:30] <coldhead> make sure it's not erroring
[01:49:05] <Genesis731> it's missing a parameter
[01:49:13] <Genesis731> it has UID and type
[01:49:31] <Genesis731> not text
[01:49:50] <Genesis731> response is null
[01:50:12] <Genesis731> and call is missing the variable
[01:50:13] <coldhead> can you fix that? :D
[01:50:31] <coldhead> ah well go back to a working version
[01:50:35] <coldhead> or a version where the ajax is
[01:51:04] <Genesis731> me?
[01:51:29] <coldhead> yes
[01:52:41] <Genesis731> OMG I DID IT :)
[01:52:49] <Genesis731> var textBox = $("#text-" + anchor[2], row);
[01:52:52] <Genesis731> ;D
[01:53:03] <coldhead> so it's all good in the hood now?
[01:53:34] <Genesis731> seems like it :)
[01:53:35] <Genesis731> wow
[01:53:40] <Genesis731> i thought it was a 2 min fix :P
[01:53:45] <coldhead> it'll get muuuch easier, Genesis731
[01:53:50] <Genesis731> i really REALLY appreciate your help :P
[01:53:55] <coldhead> i didn't realise you had duplicate IDs
[01:54:03] <coldhead> i shoulda checked the html first :)
[01:54:04] <Genesis731> i'm sure... i'm just a man of many languages as it is
[01:54:09] <Genesis731> i get them mixed a LOT
[01:54:39] <coldhead> i know the feeling
[01:55:10] <coldhead> Genesis731: if you're bored in a couple days come talk to me about a simpler way you could have done it
[01:55:13] <Genesis731> HTML, CSS, CB, C++, PHP, JAVA  and some extensions for some
[01:55:16] <coldhead> but only if you're really really bored
[01:55:18] <Genesis731> now lets add JQ and JS :P
[01:55:25] <coldhead> what's CB?
[01:55:30] <Genesis731> BASIC
[01:55:36] <coldhead> oh great
[01:55:39] <Genesis731> haha
[01:55:42] <Genesis731> right?
[01:55:46] <Genesis731> that's why i went to C++
[01:55:50] <Genesis731> then Visual C
[01:55:57] <Genesis731> cause i wasn't gettin what i wanted outa C++
[01:56:04] <Genesis731> damn command line crap :P
[01:56:27] <Genesis731> so i was pretty well in this position when i started with PHP, being how dynamic it was compared to other languages
[01:56:34] <Genesis731> and now JQ being even more so
[01:56:35] <Genesis731> :P
[01:56:37] <Genesis731> but i like it
[01:56:48] <Genesis731> the possibilities are endless and
[01:56:50] <Genesis731> :)
[01:57:13] <Genesis731> anyways i better be going, hope to see ya again soon coldhead :)
[01:57:14] <coldhead> well the whole node.js scene beckons if you grow fond of JS
[01:57:24] <Genesis731> node.js?
[01:57:30] <coldhead> google it :)
[01:57:34] <coldhead> happy hacking
[01:58:23] <Genesis731> a server?
[01:59:08] <Genesis731> and easy programming
[01:59:15] <Genesis731> i'm kinda skimmin :P
[01:59:41] <Genesis731> anyways i'll be back in a while :)
[01:59:47] <Genesis731> i'll read up on that though
[02:01:24] <Genesis731> coldhead: i'll be back to see the simplified version if you don't mind... when i'm done with my project, the more simple things are, the better
[02:01:57] <Genesis731> basically it's a login/forum that is dynamically made and the owner can change any aspect without touching code
[02:03:00] <Genesis731> everything from the color scheme is all PHP. You click background "light" basecolor "green" it dynamically colors the site using PHP to write a css file
[02:03:45] <Genesis731> the part here, as i'm sure you can see :P is admins editing accounts easily
[02:06:37] <Genesis731> coldhead: 1 LAST thing :P IE doesn't seem to respond to it, any ideas??  FF and Chrome are perfect
[02:07:55] <UberNinDude> sup coldhead
[02:08:23] <UberNinDude> I'm on androirc on the bus
[02:11:03] <r0bot> hi all
[02:11:04] <r0bot> i have this question
[02:11:05] <r0bot> echo '<a class="button roundcorner bluebutton"/>Continue</a></table>';  when i have this and visit the page it displays properly like a button, but when i call it throught jquery ajax i get this output  <a class="button roundcorner bluebutton"></a>Continue  and it messes my stuff up :) any ideas
[02:12:52] <r0bot> anyone ?
[02:13:16] <coldhead> the browser is trying to fix your malformed html
[02:13:26] <coldhead> you can't insert fragments of html with JS
[02:13:32] <coldhead> it needs to be complete
[02:13:37] <coldhead> or it will try to fix it for you
[02:16:32] <coldhead> it was nice talking to you, r0bot
[02:17:49] <r0bot> what you mean it needs to be complete coldhead
[02:18:04] <r0bot> i call a php page
[02:18:06] <coldhead> <table></table>
[02:18:06] <r0bot> through ajax
[02:18:13] <coldhead> not just </table>
[02:18:18] <r0bot> oo no
[02:18:21] <r0bot> i have a table before that
[02:18:26] <r0bot> this is the end of the table
[02:18:32] <r0bot> i just didnt see i have copied the table tag
[02:18:39] <r0bot> echo '<a class="button roundcorner bluebutton"/>Continue</a>
[02:18:44] <r0bot> i have this without the table
[02:18:56] <r0bot> and it produced <a class="button roundcorner bluebutton"></a>Continue
[02:19:00] <r0bot> when called with ajax
[02:19:06] <r0bot> if i open the page directly
[02:19:10] <r0bot> it works just fine
[02:19:16] <r0bot> but jquery ajax
[02:19:21] <r0bot> messes this up
[02:19:23] <r0bot> i dont know
[02:19:26] <r0bot> it takes
[02:19:32] <r0bot> continue out of the anchor
[02:19:45] <r0bot> really wierd
[02:20:16] <coldhead> this is broken: <a class="button roundcorner bluebutton"/>Continue</a>
[02:20:25] <coldhead> you are closing the <a> twice
[02:20:31] <sudosu> "/> is wrong
[02:21:12] <r0bot> jesus crist
[02:21:13] <r0bot> :D
[02:21:31] <r0bot> i didnt see that
[02:21:35] <r0bot> for like 2 hours
[02:21:36] <r0bot> :D
[02:21:41] <r0bot> thank you guys
[02:21:49] <r0bot> i guess i need a break or something
[02:22:02] <r0bot> i was like whtf is going on
[02:22:05] <r0bot> for quite some time
[02:27:34] <Woet> r0bot: and either way, </a></table> can't be valid
[02:27:41] <Woet> http://validator.w3.org/ please
[02:28:24] <dnsdds> How do I get the current icon name from a jQuery UI button?
[02:28:27] <r0bot> </table> isnt from the code i copied it by mistake :)
[02:28:39] <dnsdds> I tried $(this).button("icons.primary") but apparently that's not kosher
[02:33:07] <silv3r_m00n> how to get the available screen height ?
[02:33:24] <h32Lg> how can i remove all elements with display style set to 'none' within a form?
[02:33:44] <h32Lg> type of these elements is: label
[02:34:23] <h32Lg> i tought about sth like this: jQuery('form > label[style~=display:none]').each(...
[02:34:34] <waldmeister> $('#form-id label:visible').remove();
[02:34:40] <waldmeister> I think this should work
[02:35:05] <h32Lg> but this would remove the visible labels, wouldn't it?
[02:35:39] <waldmeister> right, sorry for that. $('#form-id label:hidden').remove();
[02:37:00] <h32Lg> thx :)
[02:38:54] <K1ng``> anyone got a howto use UI progressbar with $.ajax?
[02:41:18] <ravenzz> What do you need it for?
[02:41:21] <ravenzz> download?
[02:41:27] <ravenzz> uhm upload sorry
[02:41:29] <K1ng``> nope. post
[02:41:43] <ravenzz> post what?
[02:42:06] <K1ng``> data
[02:42:09] <ravenzz> I mean, the problem is know how long the request will be
[02:42:32] <waldmeister> you can't upload files via ajax, can you?
[02:42:33] <ravenzz> so basically you could split it in Steps
[02:42:46] <ravenzz> representig some kind of percentage
[02:42:52] <K1ng``> we can upload using ajax
[02:42:56] <waldmeister> files?
[02:44:01] <jita> This form http://dpaste.com/616338/ redirects to /edit/1/?status=1 but i dont want to redirect it to the edit page, rather than silently updating the status variable in the form
[02:44:04] <jita> How is it possible ?
[02:46:04] <ravenzz> K1ng`` and play with ob_flush()
[02:46:26] <ravenzz> if you handle datas by php
[02:47:42] <K1ng``> i love php
[02:49:53] <ravenzz> Does it looks possible to you?
[02:50:31] <K1ng``> ofcourse :)
[02:50:46] <johnywp> i have page 1 that has 2 LINKS to page 2 and I am trying to track which of the 2 links is clicked the most

[02:51:46] <ravenzz> google analytics?
[02:53:07] <ravenzz> johnywp ^
[03:06:52] <OnkelTem> $.find('ul') selectes all descendants, how to add self element to the selection?
[03:09:31] <zoggy> .parent?
[03:11:40] <johnywp> i am using jquery to make an image appear when a page is loaded... starts from opacity 0 and goes to 1 slowly
[03:11:57] <johnywp> the problem is that in IE, the edges of the image are not right
[03:12:14] <johnywp> instead of being fluid (as they are normally) they appear to have corners (kindof)
[03:12:16] <johnywp> any ideas?
[03:14:19] <dabear> OnkelTem: .find("ul).andSelf()
[03:14:27] <dabear> ?andself @ OnkelTem
[03:14:28] <bot-t> OnkelTem, .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[03:22:45] <OnkelTem> dabear: thanks!
[03:23:28] <OnkelTem> dabear: looks nicer, then: .find('ul').add($(this))  )

[03:44:34] <l0cal01> can't you see?
[03:45:05] <lavr-ik> nope
[03:45:22] <l0cal01> ok.
[03:46:03] <l0cal01> i am working on facebox (it's modal page) and i have a problem....
[03:46:34] <l0cal01> style of facebox page is display:none
[03:47:19] <l0cal01> that code in page is <input type="text" name="albumAdi" id="album_olustur_val"/>
[03:47:23] <coldhead> the dudes sitting in silence are still preferable to people bitching WAH WAH WAH HELP ME FIX MY PROBLEMS FOR FREE BLAH BLAH BLAH
[03:48:05] <l0cal01> if somebody will write something that input, my jquery code will get a value from that page
[03:48:19] <l0cal01> jquery code is var album_ismi = $('#album_olustur_val').val();
[03:48:46] <lavr-ik> coldhead whatever, dude )
[03:49:10] <l0cal01> lavr-ik, understand my question?
[03:49:37] <coldhead> l0cal01: http://jsfiddle.net/59n7L/
[03:49:40] <coldhead> you are wrong
[03:49:57] <coldhead> the visibility of the container does not effect val()
[03:51:00] <lavr-ik> hey since u've condescended 4 us
[03:51:29] <lavr-ik> is it possible to count an amount of props in object without (for key on obj), but using some kind of ".length" method in usual array?
[03:51:53] <coldhead> lavr-ik: you have to use ?each
[03:51:53] <bot-t> lavr-ik, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[03:52:16] <coldhead> and you have to use some weird hasOwnProperty thing
[03:52:35] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty
[03:52:47] <l0cal01> coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/FpjVC/
[03:52:54] <coldhead> so you can check for elements an object ACTUALLY has and not just the ones it inherits
[03:53:03] <lavr-ik> i think that's $.each behaves exaclty like (for kei in obj), doesn't it?
[03:53:31] <coldhead> it handles some special cases
[03:53:36] <lavr-ik> i can count an amount using (for vat key in obj) but i found it not too fancy
[03:53:39] <coldhead> but it's the same gross kind of solution
[03:53:51] <coldhead> there's no length for properties across browsers anyway
[03:54:04] <lavr-ik> ;(
[03:54:15] <coldhead> is the for loop so bad?
[03:54:22] <lavr-ik> not actually
[03:54:28] <coldhead> is the property count so necessary?
[03:54:28] <lavr-ik> but not too fancy either )
[03:54:33] <coldhead> yeah
[03:54:34] <lavr-ik> yeah
[03:54:44] <lavr-ik> i have a json
[03:54:52] <lavr-ik> and i have items in it
[03:54:58] <coldhead> i think mozilla keeps a tally of the count but of course it's not everywhere
[03:54:59] <lavr-ik> and each item is a prop
[03:55:08] <lavr-ik> and i have to count an amount of items
[03:55:15] <lavr-ik> but i can't keep items in usual array
[03:55:56] <l0cal01> coldhead it's my codes http://jsfiddle.net/FpjVC/ can you look pls? it's facebox
[03:56:00] <l0cal01> modal page
[03:56:20] <coldhead> i see the code, l0cal01, but i don;t understand the problem
[03:56:25] <coldhead> this looks like it would work
[03:56:28] <coldhead> EVEN ON FACEBOOK
[03:57:18] <coldhead> l0cal01: is it in an iframe or something?
[03:57:22] <l0cal01> you any know about if you work jquery page in display:none?
[03:57:35] <coldhead> display:none makes NO DIFFERENCE, l0cal01
[03:57:41] <coldhead> my jsfiddle demonstrates that
[03:58:19] <l0cal01> but if i removed display:none it's working?
[03:58:28] <coldhead> that makes no sense
[03:58:36] <coldhead> did you see my jsfiddle?
[03:58:50] <coldhead> the value is available with or without display:none
[03:59:01] <coldhead> is it something else?
[03:59:16] <l0cal01> but it's modal page friend..
[03:59:25] <l0cal01> it must be in display:none
[03:59:40] <coldhead> you are right, it must be
[03:59:47] <coldhead> i'm sorry, it's my first day using jQuery
[04:00:00] <coldhead> i suggest you try using the chrome web inspector debugger
[04:00:08] <coldhead> to see what is happening
[04:01:26] <l0cal01> hmm ok i will use thank you... i hope i can find the problem.
[05:00:47] <Woet> does someone recall the name of that huge javascript library?
[05:00:48] <Woet> like 300mb
[05:01:57] <waldmeister> fail js? ^^
[05:05:07] <coldhead> GWT?
[05:05:11] <coldhead> clojurescript?
[05:05:38] <Woet> no and no
[05:05:39] <Woet> hmm
[05:06:00] <coldhead> YUI?
[05:06:02] <Woet> it had huge plugins like an entire desktop
[05:06:06] <Woet> those are all small
[05:06:12] <coldhead> UR SMALL
[05:06:20] <Woet> i really mean 300 mb :p
[05:06:46] <coldhead> extjs?
[05:06:56] <Woet> thank you!
[05:07:33] * Woet hugs coldhead
[05:11:43] <Elephant> Sorry, kinda not a jquery question, but does anyone know of a way to see the source of a page, after ajax has replaced some of the markup?
[05:11:57] <Elephant> as one complete document.
[05:12:04] <coldhead> web inspector or firebug
[05:12:23] <coldhead> in web inspector you can Inspect Element, navigate to <html> and Copy as HTML
[05:12:31] <coldhead> then dump it in your editor or wherever
[05:12:47] <Elephant> k, yeah, looking to dump into w3c-v
[05:12:51] <Woet> coldhead: maybe you remember the site with amazing jquery effects too?
[05:12:57] <Woet> built upon css3, recently updated with many 3d examples
[05:13:00] <Woet> very colorful
[05:13:22] <Elephant> I guess I just didn't think about copy paste with it's nice tree formatting
[05:13:22] <coldhead> no, all i'm thinking of is the google stuff about how amazing html5 is
[05:15:10] <Elephant> :D
[05:18:03] <juha_> OOPS
[05:18:11] <juha_> one of my cronjobs didn't work properly
[05:18:27] <juha_> for the last 12 hours, it's been adding two rows per second to my database :D
[05:19:22] <coldhead> ?eval 12 * 60 * 60 * 2
[05:19:23] <bot-t> coldhead: 86400
[05:19:30] <coldhead> that's not too bad :)
[05:19:46] <juha_> yeah, it should've added about 5 rows total :D
[05:20:04] <juha_> this is what happens when i code, code and code and not test, then just push something
[05:27:35] <trgy> hello
[05:28:13] <trgy> i have a question about facebox
[05:28:22] <trgy> any one can help me?
[05:28:47] <g0rd0n> i am having quite a problem with IE9. the site works perfectly fine in Chrome and Firefox, but IE9 complains about a syntax error while loading the content of an ajax tab, however it is unable to tell me where the supposed error is... http://www.cessoalpino.com/en/statistics/ <- here it is... any ideas what is going wrong? i'm using the very latest jquery / jqueryui / datatables...
[05:40:25] <zoggy> g0rd0n, try downgrading your jquery to 1.6.1 and see if the problem still exists
[05:40:45] <zoggy> there are quite a few ie9 specific bugs that are introduced and addressed in 1.6.x
[05:41:53] <g0rd0n> zoggy: ok thanks, will try with 1.6.1 then
[05:42:37] <zoggy> well looks like it was ie8 stuff not ie9
[05:42:52] <zoggy> but anyways..still try and see if a older version works or not
[05:43:04] <zoggy> 1.5.x and 1.6.x differ a bit
[05:43:25] <zoggy> and the 1.6.1 introduce a few code changes (attr/prop)
[05:43:45] <g0rd0n> zoggy: yeah just tried 1.6.1 locally but that doesnt help
[05:44:24] <zoggy> quirk mode?
[05:44:26] <g0rd0n> 1.5.2 doenst work either
[05:44:29] <g0rd0n> what is quirk mode? :P
[05:44:37] <zoggy> compatability mode
[05:44:52] <g0rd0n> wait
[05:45:02] <zoggy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode
[05:45:18] <g0rd0n> works eiteh 1.5.2 actually
[05:45:19] <g0rd0n> :)
[05:45:26] <g0rd0n> i will try 1.6.1 again then
[05:45:39] <zoggy> just keep going up a version until it breaks
[05:45:48] <zoggy> and see what was changed.. what you need to change code wise
[05:47:32] <g0rd0n> yeah
[05:47:44] <g0rd0n> all jquery 1.6.x releases dont work
[05:47:47] <g0rd0n> 1.5.2 does fine
[05:47:56] <flint0131> fine is sexy
[05:50:32] <pen_> anyone here using backbone?
[05:51:00] <flint0131> everyone does
[05:51:38] <pen_> I have a question for backbone. I wonder in collection, if I create a model before adding to the collection, can I still hold on to that model for reference?
[05:51:46] <pen_> i'm using relationalModel too
[05:51:52] <pen_> so I am wondering
[05:52:06] <pen_> I don't want to use create because it has to specify a url
[05:52:25] <pen_> and there seems to be no way to suppress that, so it only create a new model
[05:54:50] <g0rd0n> i donw know if this problem is jquery related, but i have today = new Date(); and when i do today.format i get an error telling me that format is not a function... but i thought this is normal javascript? what is wrong?
[06:35:22] <pen_> how do I call function in model initialize function? i'm in backbone
[06:35:36] <pen_> seems like bindAll then call this.function() doesn't work
[06:38:14] <K1ng`> can i load javascript using $.ajax?
[06:40:51] <fakingfantastic> anyone here use the jQueryUI Position utility as a standalone? Im having an issue where the first call positions it wrong, but all subsequent calls position it fine
[06:46:44] <ravenzz> ?getScript @ K1ng`
[06:46:44] <bot-t> K1ng`, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[06:47:12] <K1ng`> thanks a lot mate
[07:18:10] <moryde_> Hi! How do I stop a link from reacting and replacing it with another function?
[07:18:33] <moryde_> A rugular link like www.google.com/mysite
[07:20:44] <sean`> ?click @ moryde_
[07:20:45] <bot-t> moryde_, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[07:22:19] <moryde_> And it is possible to override say like <a href="http://www.google.com/mysite">my link</a> so that it will do something else than go to google.com/mysite when that link is pressed?
[07:23:04] <Elephant> preventDefault() comes to ming.
[07:23:09] <Elephant> mind even.
[07:23:19] <sean`> yupz
[07:23:34] <sean`> $('a').bind ('click', function (e) { e.preventDefault (); .. do stuff here .. });
[07:24:16] <geekbuntu> sean, why use (e) there?  it's already $(this) - wouldn't it work just as well without it?
[07:24:31] * geekbuntu asking because when is aw that for the first time i wondered :-D
[07:31:05] <lavr-ik> emm
[07:31:20] <lavr-ik> i have an object var a = { 1: undefined }
[07:32:01] <lavr-ik> i know for sure that it is the only prop. question: how can i get a value of prop without manually writing it?
[07:32:17] <lavr-ik> i need to get an integer 1 from it
[07:32:37] <lavr-ik> but i dont know what the integer it is, it's dynamical
[07:38:30] <moryde_> sean`: I cant get that to work. It is supposed to work on all link if I include it in the beginning of the file?
[07:39:06] <sean`> moryde_, that will disable all your links.
[07:39:13] <sean`> Remember you need to put it in a document ready statement
[07:43:05] <moryde_> It does not work for me.. http://ydefeldt.dk/wordpress/ I am on safari..
[07:44:31] <moryde_> sean`: See the problem?
[07:44:53] <sean`> moryde_, pastebin your code
[07:45:48] <moryde_> sean`: http://pastebin.com/bw3dsYpY
[07:46:12] <sean`> moryde_, function (e) { e.preventDefault (); ... here the code }
[07:46:28] <sean`> <sean`> $('a').bind ('click', function (e) { e.preventDefault (); .. do stuff here .. });
[07:46:42] <sean`> I've said it twice now ;) good luck
[07:46:57] <JackBauer24> How to select parent's element? I want to select ".votes_num" after clicking on "#sth": http://pastebin.com/QGdBWuY3

[08:53:44] <kayam> sup
[08:54:16] <imsky> soup
[08:54:38] <imsky> brauliobo: look into event target
[08:55:59] <brauliobo> imsky: hum, checking its type?
[08:56:11] <imsky> checking the event target
[08:56:23] <imsky> if the target isn't "body" or something, then you should ignore it
[08:56:56] <brauliobo> hum, got it
[08:57:00] <brauliobo> imsky: thank you!
[08:57:10] <brauliobo> tricky!
[08:57:20] <imsky> yeah it is, not widely explained ;)
[08:57:40] <brauliobo> seriously, can you please refer me some doc?
[08:57:46] <brauliobo> i googled at lot....
[08:57:56] <imsky> lol
[08:58:07] <imsky> http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[08:59:29] <brauliobo> there is is :)
[09:01:37] <jdevel> hey how is everyone doing?
[09:01:47] <sterna> great
[09:01:52] <jdevel> glad to hear that
[09:01:53] <kayam> good, you jdevel
[09:02:00] <sterna> i've just finished my visualization enhancements
[09:02:09] <kayam> tring to get ape-project to work on my linode
[09:02:13] <jdevel> I'm doing alright, got a little issue w/ an ancient language I'm forced to use because of a project takeover..
[09:02:14] <sterna> i must make a video
[09:02:44] <kayam> what language?
[09:02:57] <imsky> is it perl
[09:02:59] <sterna> COBOL :)
[09:03:00] <jdevel> I know this isn't jquery stuff, but I was hoping I could ask here because I've tried other channels and no one knows..
[09:03:07] <jdevel> nah, it's actually classic asp
[09:03:14] <sterna> oh dear
[09:03:16] <kayam> heh
[09:03:17] <sterna> sorry :|
[09:03:20] <jdevel> lol
[09:03:45] <imsky> is it javascript asp?
[09:03:54] <jdevel> I know it isn't on topic but I really appreciate the level of knowledge this channel has so if everyone would allow me to ask
[09:03:57] <jdevel> no it's vbscript
[09:04:01] <jdevel> even better!
[09:04:06] <imsky> bah
[09:04:15] <jdevel> indeed
[09:04:31] <jdevel> my questions is about the adodb.command object
[09:04:52] <imsky> son
[09:04:57] <imsky> this is #jquery
[09:04:58] <jdevel> I'm using that because the previous developer used inline sql and there were soooo many security holes
[09:05:05] <jdevel> SQL injections everywhere
[09:05:06] <jdevel> I know
[09:05:24] <jdevel> I mentioned above about why I'm asking in here, however I can just go piss up a rope.
[09:05:34] <imsky> that rope doesn't deserve it
[09:05:54] <jdevel> nevermind, you've got a foul attitude today
[09:06:01] <kayam> heh html, css or javascript would be closer to home
[09:06:08] <salomonv> hi, trying to create a webapp that should display data somewhere when clicking on a word, but the data is different for every word, any suggestions how I could implement that?
[09:06:11] <jdevel> I'm well aware of that
[09:06:29] <imsky> salomonv: create a js object for each word
[09:06:40] <imsky> orrrr...attach data to a span containing the word!
[09:07:02] <salomonv> imsky: and how would I do that? :P
[09:07:09] <imsky> do what
[09:07:19] <salomonv> attach data to a span
[09:07:40] <imsky> well
[09:07:44] <imsky> you can do it inline or with jquery
[09:07:49] <salomonv> it's actually a webapp but I figured there'd be more people here than in #jquerymobile, but I want to display the info in a header kindof thingy
[09:07:57] <imsky> <span data-crap="hello">World</span>
[09:08:04] <imsky> or $("span").data("crap","World");
[09:09:00] <kayam> second one would be cleaer and easier to manage
[09:09:16] <jdevel> take it easy.. I'm just going to deal with this trial and error
[09:09:28] <kayam> later jdevel
[09:09:31] <kayam> good luck
[09:09:36] <jdevel> thanks
[09:10:33] <lenswipe> hey guys
[09:10:34] <salomonv> hmm, gonna give it a try, thanks

[09:13:37] <kayam> whats cool sterna
[09:13:40] <lenswipe> kayam, why are you showing me that?
[09:13:45] <kayam> lenswipe, i don't see the js
[09:13:50] <lenswipe> hmm
[09:13:51] <lenswipe> ?
[09:13:57] <lenswipe> the js is on the actual page

[09:14:58] <l0cal01> #php
[09:15:12] <imsky> #welcometothejungle
[09:16:13] <fakingfantastic> if I have $("option") , can i use find to return one by value? I know i can do $("option[value=1]")  but what about as an additional method afterwards, like .find("[value=1]") or something?
[09:18:08] <fakingfantastic> lenswipe: you are using jQ 1.3, focusout was added in 1.4
[09:18:37] <fakingfantastic> lenswipe: http://95.146.92.33/taskmanager/application/views/desktop/js/jquery.js   ,  http://api.jquery.com/focusout/
[09:18:57] <lenswipe> fakingfantastic, what does focusout have to do with anything>?
[09:19:06] <fakingfantastic> look at your error on page load
[09:19:16] <fakingfantastic> lenswipe: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'focusout'
[09:19:26] <fakingfantastic> is causing your code to die
[09:19:27] <lenswipe> fakingfantastic, the focusout actually works
[09:19:54] <fakingfantastic> trust me, fix your error
[09:19:57] <fakingfantastic> upgrade jQ
[09:20:01] <lenswipe> i cant
[09:20:22] <fakingfantastic> ok, well focusout is not defined.
[09:20:27] <lenswipe> focusout works
[09:20:29] <fakingfantastic> It doesn't work, you think it might
[09:20:32] <lenswipe> how many times must i say it
[09:20:36] <lenswipe> it definately does work
[09:20:52] <fakingfantastic> nope
[09:20:53] <lenswipe> fakingfantastic, type something in the forename and surname fields
[09:20:54] <fakingfantastic> keyup works
[09:20:57] <lenswipe> im telling you it works
[09:21:08] <fakingfantastic> Says the guy with an error in his code
[09:21:17] <kayam> heh
[09:21:42] <fakingfantastic> your keyup works, which is why updateUser() is firing
[09:21:44] <imsky> so catty in here
[09:21:53] <lenswipe> ok
[09:21:57] <lenswipe> so what should be happening?
[09:22:01] <fakingfantastic> but your focusout most definately does not work
[09:22:03] <kayam> data question, find whatever.. you could use .each($('.blah').alldata(),( to grab info
[09:22:37] <fakingfantastic> kayam: i was hoping jQ had a method for it, rather than a loop
[09:25:12] <fakingfantastic> lenswipe: everytime you keyup in the sur or forename, the username will get updated to be the lower-cased first 5 letters of the first name plus the first letter in the forename, plus an "18" at the end
[09:25:56] <lenswipe> yeah i know that
[09:26:01] <lenswipe> i wrote that code lol
[09:26:23] <fakingfantastic> so what isn't working for you?
[09:26:51] <lenswipe> im asking what focusout does
[09:26:57] <lenswipe> and its the form validation thats not working for me
[09:27:16] <imsky> focusout gets your ford focus out of its garage
[09:27:22] <fakingfantastic> focusout is a callback when you leave the focus of an element
[09:27:32] <fakingfantastic> lenswipe: I know you don't want to believe im right, and you got your pride in tact - which is good, but just believe that since im a total stranger who took the time to look at your code, and I've found an error due to you using a method that doesn't exist, that im actually helping you out, and that you should go ahead and fix the big red error on your page :)
[09:27:34] <imsky> if you do $("*").trigger('focusout'), all ford focuses leave garages
[09:27:41] <imsky> pretty powerful function
[09:28:08] <lenswipe> fakingfantastic, i do belive you, im more making the point that you're fixing the wrong thing
[09:28:15] <fakingfantastic> imsky: agreed, Henry Ford, contributor of the $.focusout() project
[09:28:27] * fakingfantastic rolls eyes
[09:28:28] <lenswipe> i wasnt asking you about onfocusout
[09:28:32] <imsky> henry ford was jquerying before we were born
[09:28:35] <lenswipe> i was asking you why the form validation didnt work
[09:28:43] <fakingfantastic> lenswipe: right....
[09:28:46] <fakingfantastic> ...and im telling you why
[09:28:52] <fakingfantastic> ....because you have an error in your code...
[09:29:01] <lenswipe> *sigh*
[09:29:31] <lenswipe> the part that you're saying isnt working is after the part that im having problems with
[09:29:49] <lenswipe> ie: the code that im having issues with is run before the code that you say doesnt work
[09:30:01] <fakingfantastic> lenswipe: nope, you're wrong
[09:30:10] <fakingfantastic> Your code is in a submit() callback
[09:30:17] <fakingfantastic> that doesn't get executed til it's clicked
[09:30:19] <lenswipe> ok
[09:30:24] <fakingfantastic> doc.ready runs before that
[09:30:32] <fakingfantastic> which has your focusout() code in it
[09:30:38] <lenswipe> so you're saying if i comment out the doc.ready then my form validation should work?

[09:31:49] <lenswipe> fakingfantastic, if i comment out the broken code will my other code work?
[09:31:52] <lenswipe> yes or no
[09:31:55] <lenswipe> its a simple enough question
[09:32:40] <fakingfantastic> First off...
[09:32:43] <fakingfantastic> fix your error...
[09:32:47] <fakingfantastic> second...
[09:32:53] <fakingfantastic> Your validation code will not work
[09:32:58] <lenswipe> ok
[09:33:00] <lenswipe> why wont it work?
[09:33:10] <fakingfantastic> because of the error
[09:33:17] <fakingfantastic> Comment out JUST the focusout code
[09:33:22] <lenswipe> ok
[09:33:33] <lenswipe> done
[09:33:36] <fakingfantastic> no
[09:33:40] <fakingfantastic> all of it
[09:33:44] <lenswipe> done

[09:33:57] <fakingfantastic> {

[10:03:40] <PhonicUK> hey all - where i have a container div full of elements that have either had .show() or .hide() applied to them, what would be the selector to find all the ones that are visible or hidden?
[10:05:39] <imsky> $(container).find(":visible")
[10:16:08] <PhonicUK> imsky, cheers - got it
[10:16:24] <PhonicUK> btw - is there a way of specifying the default animation + parameters to use for the show() and hide() methods?
[10:23:04] <YourA1gebra> afternoon
[10:27:20] <YourA1gebra> I'm having a few issues with jTypeWriter.js plugin and was wondering if I could get some help
[10:28:02] <YourA1gebra> after it loops a few times, the text starts to get jumbled up and it just becomes random letters
[10:52:20] <lavr-ik> how to acquire nodename with jquery syntax?
[10:52:38] <tbranyen> jQuery("#something")[0].nodeName
[10:52:59] <lavr-ik> owrly
[10:53:23] <lavr-ik> it doesn't work if you use jquery object
[10:53:35] <lavr-ik> and it is correct
[10:54:12] <flint0131> O.o
[11:03:21] <salomonv> I know I should be asking this on #jquerymobile but there's not a lot of activity there, so I'll give it a try here: is there any way to prevent a fixed headerbar from disappearing when you tap?
[11:15:38] <pjp> Hi, what is a decent way to upload a file using jquery-ajax?
[11:19:13] <djQuery> pjp: have you see ?ajaxform

[11:45:28] <jimmy___> hi all
[11:46:12] <jimmy___> i have found a bug
[11:46:41] <jimmy___> bgiframe
[11:48:51] <lduros> hello, I'd like to use JSON.stringify() and then display a large nested json string properly in HTML, currently it's showing all in one line and unreadable. I was wondering if there's something already done for this
[11:48:52] <lduros> thanks
[11:49:09] <lduros> a little like print_r() with php
[11:50:17] <tbranyen> lduros: copy and paste into chrome dev tools console
[11:50:26] <tbranyen> wrap in parens first tho
[11:50:31] <tbranyen> ( JSON_STR )
[11:50:37] <tbranyen> that'll break it down into a nice tree for you
[11:50:57] <lduros> cool, i use firefox usually not chrome, but will take a look at chrome :-)
[11:51:20] <tbranyen> you can do the same thing in firebug
[11:51:25] <tbranyen> just paste it into the console
[11:51:40] <Woet> what would be the best way to have clickable table rows?
[11:51:49] <lduros> tbranyen: so it returns an object with children?
[11:51:56] <tbranyen> yes
[11:51:56] <Woet> i mean, i can put an <a href> inside the <td>, but this won't make the entire row clickable
[11:52:07] <tbranyen> Woet: bind a click event to the TR
[11:52:11] <Woet> and onclick="window.location = '....';" won't honer things like ctrl + click for new tabs
[11:52:14] <Woet> :)
[11:52:16] <lduros> tbranyen: ok thanks
[11:52:47] <tbranyen> Woet: you're not going to be able to get something like that to work anyways on a TR
[11:52:52] <tbranyen> thats specific to anchors
[11:53:10] <Woet> tbranyen: nothing is impossible
[11:53:24] <tbranyen> ctrl clickign into a new tab on a tr
[11:53:26] <tbranyen> is
[11:53:31] <Woet> nope
[11:53:35] <Woet> already found a plugin that does it
[11:53:40] <Woet> but it doesn't work with onmouseover effects
[11:53:40] <tbranyen> link
[11:53:58] <tbranyen> I'm telling ya unless you have an anchor in there, its not possible
[11:54:00] <Woet> tbranyen: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/table-rows-as-clickable-anchors/
[11:55:02] <tbranyen> Woet: and what does that say?
[11:55:07] <tbranyen> Then I had another thought; instead of having to update the anchor’s position whenever the document’s mousemove event triggered, I could just keep it statically hovering over the table row; like a blanket.
[11:55:15] <tbranyen> He's overlaying an anchor
[11:55:34] <Woet> tbranyen: i don't care what the solution is :)
[11:55:40] <Woet> if overlaying an anchor works, then thats fine
[11:55:41] <tbranyen> then don't argue :)
[11:55:47] <Woet> but i want it to work with onmouseover too
[11:55:59] <Woet> hence, looking for altneratives to that plguin
[11:56:00] <Woet> plugin
[11:56:05] <jorenl_> Hey all! (sorry to interrupt)
[11:56:18] <tbranyen> that plugin will still work, probably just needs some modification to trigger the hover event of the element you hovered over
[11:56:19] <Woet> i could also do funky stuff like looking whether ctrl is pressed on the click element
[11:56:22] <Woet> but i dont want to go there
[11:56:30] <tbranyen> yeah thats a poor idea
[11:56:50] <Woet> its for internal use only
[11:56:53] <Woet> but still
[11:57:48] <jimmy___> a question :  in firefox6, if i ture on firebug after load page , the window will show a blank page, any one know this ?
[11:58:23] <jimmy___> wrong
[11:58:33] <jimmy___> before load page
[11:58:39] <jorenl_> I expected $('.message:last').stop(true).delay(5000).fadeOut(700, function() {...}); to reset when I 'run' it again before the delay finished
[11:58:50] <jorenl_> but it doesn't seem to be working, what am I doing wrong?
[12:02:52] <jimmy___> a question :  in firefox6, if i ture on firebug before load page , the window will show a blank page, anyone know this ?
[12:03:29] <jimmy___> just after page loaded, firebug can works
[12:04:22] <jimmy___> and another bug, in ie6 if use the bgiframe and load(somefile) to pop, the pop can not use html() function, if html(...), ie6 will be crashed.
[12:12:51] <jimmy___> hello?
[12:13:38] <jorenl_> jimmy___: I wish i could help, my question isn't being answered either
[12:14:01] <jorenl_> & one tip: forget about IE6
[12:16:02] <jorenl_> zeg maar da t gewoon afstaat :P
[12:24:30] <jorenl_> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/stop-does-not-clear-delay helped, and animate() is cancelable. nice
[12:27:22] <pjp> djQuery: Hi, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form, this work in cases where html page has a form. Is there a way fetch the file contents in a variable, and then submit such variable through a JS function, instead of ajaxform or ajaxsubmit?
[12:27:41] <djQuery> dunno
[12:28:18] <pjp> djQuery: ah ok, thanks.
[12:29:31] <djQuery> pjp: how are u getting the file ?   have you look at see ?uploadify
[12:29:31] <bot-t> pjp, uploadify - a multiple file upload plugin that allows the easy integration of a multiple (or single) file uploads on your website. http://www.uploadify.com
[12:29:46] * pjp clicks

[12:30:29] <djQuery> ?lmgtfy jquery ajax file upload@pjp
[12:30:29] <bot-t> pjp, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+ajax+file+upload
[12:32:13] <pjp> djQuery: hmmn..uploadify requires flash support I guess,
[12:34:04] <pjp> djQuery: I've an html page with few elements, and a js function to submit those after processing them, I need to add a file input field to the same page. I need to fetch its content, but not submit it
[12:35:10] <djQuery> pjp: you mean process the contents of the file client side ?
[12:35:44] <Elephant> Anyone know if fancybox will fail if called from another fancybox?
[12:37:16] <pjp> djQuery: yes
[12:38:21] <r3b00tx> hi, looking for help on ajaxStart()
[12:39:27] <r3b00tx> i have to make multiple ajax queries but i need to display progress on one specific ajax request, how can i do this
[12:39:38] <r3b00tx> any help?
[12:40:17] <r3b00tx> i tried with .ajaxStart() but it fires up on every ajax req. have to be fired though
[12:40:34] <jimmy___> ajaxerror
[12:41:23] <jimmy___> $('#div').ajaxerror(e,xhr,....)
[12:42:43] <r3b00tx> @jimmy  is tat possible? ajaxerror fires up only when ther is an error, aint it?
[12:44:17] <r3b00tx> @jimmy  i was making some 3 ajax req and i want to display an image on one specific req.
[12:44:35] <r3b00tx> @jimmy is tat possible atleast? thanks
[12:46:18] <jimmy___> maybe json ?
[12:46:48] <jimmy___> sorry i have not knew you means, yet
[12:48:48] <jimmy___> use ajax, put ({one:1,tow:2,three:3}), or return that?
[12:50:43] <r3b00tx> nah i dont think i cud add all three requests on one .ajax() method
[12:51:17] <r3b00tx> have to be creating three seperate .ajax() methods
[12:51:40] <jimmy___> ye
[12:52:04] <r3b00tx> point is, i need to identify each req separately and pick one
[12:52:19] <r3b00tx> this thing is pulling by head for hte past 2 hrs
[12:53:13] <jimmy___> show me the codes
[12:54:46] <jimmy___> etc: $.get('action/qcheck_id.php?act='+$('#act').val()+'&qid='+$('#qwid').val(), function(res){ do something.....
[12:55:12] <danheberden> whoa jimmy___ might want to start using the data object instead
[12:55:52] <danheberden> $.get( 'action/qcheck_id.php', { act: actVal, qid: qidVal}, function(res){} );
[12:56:04] <danheberden> a bit easier than worry about making the query string
[12:56:55] <jimmy___> $.get( 'action/qcheck_id.php', { act: actVal, qid: qidVal}, function(res){},json );
[12:56:58] <jimmy___> add json at last
[13:07:36] <salomonv1> Hi, know this should be on #jquerymobile but it's very quiet there... is there a way to stop a fixed headerbar from disappearing on a click event?
[13:11:51] <Prash7> Anyone remember me? ;)

[13:16:45] <ajpiano> lata!
[13:17:19] <r3b00tx> @jimmy c the code goes like this
[13:18:02] <r3b00tx> $.ajax({	type: "POST",	url: "busdata.php",data: $('#frmsearch').serialize(),success: function(data){$('#busdata').html(data);$('#displaydata').click();return false;	}	});	}return false;});
[13:18:16] <r3b00tx> and i m using @
[13:18:42] <r3b00tx> and i m using $.ajaxStart() to display the image at the start of ajax req
[13:19:03] <r3b00tx> the ajax request is working fine
[13:19:24] <r3b00tx> i simply need to display a image on start of ajax req
[13:19:52] <r3b00tx> i cant use .ajaxStart() method since it fires up on all ajax req throughout the document
[13:19:58] <r3b00tx> any help>
[13:20:22] <jimmy___> ajaxStart() is global
[13:20:33] <meowsus> Hey guys. If my index.php file includes a JS file that starts with $(function() {} ); and also has a JS block at the top of my page that starts with $(function() {} ); does jQuery combine the commands in both locations asif they were both written in the same $(function() {} ); block?
[13:20:46] <Prash7> Yes it does
[13:22:09] <meowsus> Simiar to when you include jQuery twice on the same page, one is just overlooked
[13:22:17] <meowsus> Man. Smart stuff.
[13:22:20] <meowsus> Thanks!
[13:22:51] <jimmy___> $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "busdata.php",data: $('#frmsearch').serialize(),before:function(){$('#img').show();},success: function(data){$('#busdata').html(data);$('#displaydata').click();return false; } }); }return false;});
[13:22:52] <danheberden> meowsus they're still two different functions
[13:22:57] <danheberden> thus, two separate scopes
[13:23:10] <jimmy___> before:function(){$('#img').show();} is usefull ?
[13:23:22] <danheberden> (function(){ var a = "nou"; }); (function() { typeof a; /* undefined */ });
[13:23:25] <meowsus> danheberden, Okay, that makes sense.
[13:23:27] <Prash7> meowsus however they will still both function after the page load
[13:23:39] <meowsus> Prash7, just in order of execution, right
[13:23:39] <meowsus> ?
[13:24:29] <Prash7> Yep
[13:25:46] <jimmy___> any one used UEstudio and subversion ?
[13:26:42] <lazyPower> UEstudio being UltraEdit Studio?

[13:30:30] <jimmy___> good job danheberden
[13:30:37] <Elephant> I vote robot.
[13:30:59] <Prash7> I vote some guy with a tiny penis and no friends
[13:31:02] <Prash7> *jus sayin*
[13:31:06] <Elephant> aw thats just mean.
[13:31:11] <Prash7> Can I just ask, why don't you stay op?
[13:31:23] <Elephant> tis the freenode way
[13:31:32] <Elephant> it's like anti-efnet style.
[13:32:03] <Prash7> I see
[13:32:34] <danheberden> Prash7 that's just saying "look at me, i have OP"
[13:33:14] <Prash7> Ahh, fair enough
[13:33:30] <danheberden> next time i'll op you and you can kick/ban
[13:33:32] <danheberden> :)
[13:33:49] <Prash7> Haha!
[13:33:50] <Prash7> Thanks <3
[13:35:04] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. I have a simple contact form that I have sample text positioned over a text input element that I listen for clicks on, then hide the sample text and focus the input element. Only problem is that it blurs it immediately after. Any ideas?
[13:36:13] <danheberden> Whirl3d how 'bout you make a quick demo of that on jsfiddle.net so we can help you figure it out :)
[13:37:26] <Prash7> Whirl3d its because you gotta only hide the sample text when the sample text is in the box
[13:37:52] <Prash7> you can't have it hide all the text, you gotta specify
[13:38:05] <Prash7> As mentioned, if you throw up an example, it'll be easier
[13:43:05] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/eEfUQ/12/
[13:44:04] <Prash7> Wow, you seem to have done that in quite a long winded way :L
[13:44:36] <Whirl3d> How so?
[13:44:55] <Prash7> There are simpler ways to do it.
[13:45:09] <Whirl3d> Since I want to style the sample text differently than the input text, it gets tricky.
[13:45:31] <Prash7> So all your trying to achieve is some sample text in the text box, its clicked and its gone?
[13:45:40] <Prash7> And if the box is left blank it'll return to the sample text/
[13:45:45] <Whirl3d> I can't modify the input text value (like I would normally do) because it resizes
[13:45:47] <Whirl3d> yep
[13:46:02] <danheberden> Whirl3d http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/placeholder
[13:46:23] <danheberden> that way, you can use the regular placeholder attr and use that plugin as a polyfill
[13:47:14] <Whirl3d> The problem danheberden is that the text has to be the same for placeholders
[13:47:21] <Whirl3d> It has to be the same font, size, etc.
[13:47:42] <Whirl3d> I want a different font, a different size, etc. That makes the input field change size
[13:49:12] <r3b00tx> jimmy___: thanks will check it :)
[13:49:32] <Whirl3d> I've had it working fine recently. I just can't figure out why the blur handler is being called right after I focus() the input element
[13:52:21] <Whirl3d> Prash7, danheberden, thanks for your help btw. Any ideas why the field is losing focus?
[13:53:16] <Prash7> might be the positioning of your blur function?
[13:56:06] <Whirl3d> How so? You mean because it's defined after the initForm() function?
[13:57:11] <Whirl3d> actually, I am pretty sure it has to do with the mousedown handler. If I change it to Click it doesn't call the blur function
[13:57:25] <Prash7> Right
[13:58:51] <Whirl3d> So the mouseup function steals focus?
[13:59:18] <Prash7> I'm not too sure tbh :L
[13:59:25] <Prash7> Sorry
[14:00:02] <Whirl3d> np. I got it fixed. Thanks for your help.
[14:00:44] <Prash7> Awesome sauce
[14:20:10] <salomonv1> i have a lot of divs, called #content-n with n from 1 to 10, but sometimes 5, sometimes 15.... is there a way to use $("#page-....").live() so that it binds for every page-n?
[14:25:03] <danheberden> salomonv1 adding a class to all of those would help
[14:25:17] <danheberden> $( '.contentThingies').live...
[14:25:32] <Prash7> I swear there's a selector with a wildcard?
[14:25:33] <Prash7> like
[14:25:52] <Prash7> ('#page-'*) or something
[14:27:33] <danheberden> Prash7 yeah, you can do $('*[id^="content"]') but that'd be way less performant
[14:27:47] <danheberden> chances are if you have a shit load of id's like that, there's a bigger problem
[14:27:54] <danheberden> as far as making this hard to manage
[14:28:10] <Prash7> Classes defo the better option then
[14:30:27] <salomonv1> used the wildcard, thanks, that works
[14:42:37] <fedora_newb> I would like to have an ajax loading feature when forms and what not fire an ajax call. I was wondering if there was an efficient way of showing like a ajax loading beside the firing element without have a div or something like that already in place of the design?

[15:10:57] <xp_prg> hi all, I have a wierd problem, I am trying to do some web screen scraping but the web page is using an ajax call, as a result I need to get the table from like the firebug javascript interactive area, any suggestions on the best way to do that and save it to a file?
[15:11:28] <snover> stop stealing content from other people if you can’t figure out how to do it yourself :)
[15:12:27] <l0cal01> how can i do regex in jquery? alfanumeric?
[15:12:43] <l0cal01> alphanumeric
[15:12:54] <snover> ?jsisjs @ l0cal01
[15:12:54] <bot-t> l0cal01, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[15:13:36] <l0cal01> var mesaj = $('#mesaj'+id).val();
[15:14:01] <l0cal01> i want to use regex in this...
[15:14:24] <l0cal01> var mesaj = $('#mesaj regex????').val();
[15:14:37] <l0cal01> alphanumeric
[15:14:38] <dabear> l0cal01: what you wanna match?
[15:14:44] <dabear> children?
[15:14:51] <l0cal01> alphanumeric
[15:14:53] <l0cal01> 0-9
[15:15:11] <dabear> so all #messaj0, #messaj1 etc?
[15:15:17] <l0cal01> var mesaj = $('#mesaj *:regex([0-9]+)').val();
[15:15:25] <l0cal01> is it true?
[15:15:31] <dabear> ?startswith @ l0cal01
[15:15:33] <bot-t> l0cal01, Attribute Starts With Selector [name^="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[15:15:54] <dabear> there is no regex selector
[15:16:23] <l0cal01> ok, how can i get id element with jquery?
[15:16:57] <l0cal01> <textarea rows="0" cols="0" name="yorum" id="there is number">
[15:17:15] <l0cal01> how can i get id element with jquery?
[15:17:23] <dabear> textarea[id^=messaj]
[15:17:35] <lar_zzz> $('#your_id');
[15:18:26] <l0cal01> dabear
[15:18:46] <l0cal01> i want to get just number of id element <textarea rows="0" cols="0" name="yorum" id="there is number">
[15:18:54] <l0cal01> how?
[15:19:21] <dabear> no
[15:19:29] <dabear> html ids cannot only contain numbers
[15:19:29] <l0cal01> no?
[15:19:39] <dabear> it is not allowed
[15:19:51] <l0cal01> it is impossible?_
[15:19:57] <dabear> wtf
[15:20:03] <snover> dabear: they can in html5.
[15:20:13] <dabear> YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ONLY NUMBERS IN AN ID
[15:20:32] <l0cal01> of course
[15:20:34] <snover> l0cal01: if you want to select a bunch of similar elements, assign them a class and select based on the class. this is why classes exist.
[15:20:45] <l0cal01> <textarea rows="0" cols="0" name="yorum" id="mesaj1">
[15:20:48] <l0cal01> it's so
[15:20:50] <snover> do not use an id selector.
[15:20:52] <snover> the end.
[15:20:55] <l0cal01> how can i get?
[15:20:57] <l0cal01> now
[15:21:10] <dabear> $("#mesaj1")
[15:21:37] <l0cal01> not value, in id element?
[15:21:48] <l0cal01> it will get textarea value yep?
[15:21:55] <snover> u trollin bro?
[15:22:15] <l0cal01> i only want to get value in id element

[15:24:39] <l0cal01> how can i make that?
[15:39:30] <sanduz2> is there any way to stop jquery from queueing up functions? like if you have a function triggered by mouse event, and you do the mouse event really fast but the function is an animation that takes a second, once you stop all the animations will keep running
[15:43:27] <bbrandon> sanduz2: .stop(true, true)

[15:56:13] <zxww> do ajax calls send the referrer information along?
[16:02:43] <jbrokc> how would I join with negating hasClass? that is, $('#foo').!hasClass('bar') ?
[16:07:37] <l0cal01> i solved my problem with $(this).attr("src", function() {

[16:19:33] <Chat9522> سلام عليكم
[16:31:23] <danheberden> jbrokc $( '.whatever' ).not( '.somethingElse' ); would give you objects of class .whatever, but that aren't of class .somethingElse
[16:33:01] <danheberden> that won't give you a boolean, but you can use the .length to check whether or not it worked

[16:53:55] <maximedt> coldhead, I would like to do that : when I click in an input, a modal open with a list of links that contains text to enter in the input

[16:55:55] <maximedt> thanks for helping me
[16:56:05] <maximedt> i'm just beginning and i don't understand
[16:56:23] <Ziggy`> johnywp: With some help of .animate (jQuery UI). http://jsfiddle.net/gKqRJ/3/
[16:56:42] <maximedt> the error in the console is Uncaught TypeError: Object [object HTMLInputElement] has no method 'val'
[16:56:58] <Ziggy`> johnywp: Just a quick example
[16:57:15] <johnywp> thank you very much Ziggy!
[17:02:35] <maximedt> do you have an idea of the problem coldhead ?
[17:05:36] <coldhead> maximedt: does it say which line the error is on?
[17:06:06] <maximedt> yes, 24th
[17:06:11] <coldhead> ah i see maximedt
[17:06:22] <coldhead> you're storing the DOM element as an attribute
[17:06:30] <coldhead> but then you're trying to use it as a jQuery element
[17:06:38] <coldhead> so you need to wrap it in $() at some stage
[17:06:57] <coldhead> $( $(this).attr('object') ).val(to_enter);
[17:07:00] <coldhead> would do
[17:07:04] <maximedt> at the line $("a[class='enter_in_form']").attr('object', this);
[17:07:17] <maximedt> ?
[17:07:22] <coldhead> or sure, on that line
[17:07:32] <coldhead> $("a[class='enter_in_form']").attr('object', $(this));
[17:07:38] <coldhead> then the other line will Just Work
[17:08:40] <maximedt> now it says Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'val'
[17:09:34] <coldhead> paste the update code?
[17:09:42] <coldhead> updated*
[17:10:09] <maximedt> i update in real time
[17:10:15] <coldhead> oh okay
[17:10:19] <maximedt> http://www.maximedt.com/test2/sidebar.js
[17:12:40] <johnywp> does anybody see a problem here?
[17:12:40] <johnywp> http://pastebin.com/FuJc33sG
[17:12:45] <johnywp> must be syntax
[17:12:49] <johnywp> cause nothing is happening
[17:13:21] <coldhead> maximedt: http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/477752/477749/
[17:13:52] <Ziggy`> johnywp: When using that, do you have jQuery UI loaded?
[17:14:03] <johnywp> yeap
[17:14:15] <johnywp> it used to work with .css but .animate doesn't seem to do it
[17:14:23] <Ziggy`> johnywp: Change 'background-color' to backgroundColor
[17:15:08] <johnywp> nope.. that wasn't it
[17:15:23] <johnywp> i used to have it background-color : .... and opacity: ... and it worked
[17:15:26] <johnywp> with .css
[17:15:36] <johnywp> when i did .animate and i added the duration, it does nothing
[17:16:34] <maximedt> coldhead, it seams there is no difference
[17:17:39] <Ziggy`> http://pastie.org/2550286 - keep the e.preventDefault() if it's a link..
[17:18:21] <Ziggy`> johnywp: This is tested and works in both cases, http://jsfiddle.net/8HaeB/
[17:19:56] <coldhead> maximedt: do you have a live demo?
[17:20:04] <coldhead> it works fine in my imagination
[17:20:05] <johnywp> interesting
[17:20:09] <johnywp> i can see it work
[17:20:10] <coldhead> might need something more solid
[17:21:00] <johnywp> but i cannot get mine to work :S
[17:21:08] <johnywp> plus... the prevent default made the link not work
[17:21:34] <maximedt> sure

[17:22:51] <johnywp> i understand
[17:22:55] <johnywp> trying to figure it out
[17:23:21] <johnywp> what else could i be looking for? any ideas?

[17:28:35] <coldhead> maximedt: i don't understand what this is meant to be doing sorry
[17:29:16] <maximedt> i need to enter value in inputs
[17:29:37] <maximedt> by a list of value (the choice is made in the modal box)
[17:29:51] <StanAccy> Is it possible to style the results (or set the CSS style) of results loaded by the Autocomplete widget?
[17:32:03] <danheberden> StanAccy the classes are designed to be overridden for your own exploits
[17:32:42] <coldhead> i figured it out, maximedt
[17:32:50] <coldhead> you can't store a DOM element as an attr()
[17:32:56] <coldhead> it converts it to a string
[17:33:41] <StanAccy> danheberden: So how do I set the css class of the first 2 results to one thing, and the next 2 to something else? (Im talking about the suggestions that appear below the autocomplete box)
[17:34:09] <maximedt> ok
[17:34:10] <coldhead> maximedt: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/477764/
[17:34:16] <coldhead> use data instead of attr()
[17:34:20] <coldhead> and it should work
[17:34:43] <danheberden> StanAccy if you're targetting browsers that support nth-child you can style it that way
[17:34:48] <danheberden> otherwise, you need to make a custom renderer
[17:35:28] <StanAccy> danheberden: The order and qty of popup results and their types is arbitrary.  Sounds like a custom renderer is needed
[17:35:29] <maximedt> you rocks coldhead
[17:35:37] <danheberden> StanAccy to do that, check out this demo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[17:35:42] <maximedt> thanks a lot
[17:35:47] <danheberden> you can make your own renderItem function
[17:36:23] <johnywp> that is so weird
[17:36:32] <danheberden> NOU
[17:36:32] <johnywp> i copied your exact code from jfiddle
[17:36:42] <johnywp> i click on Click Me on my site and it doesn't work
[17:36:53] <StanAccy> danheberden: Just so Im clear - that demo just shows 3 results (for 'j') all styled the same, correct
[17:36:54] <coldhead> you're welcome maximedt
[17:37:00] <coldhead> i'm glad we got it out
[17:37:16] <danheberden> StanAccy yeah, in that case it's just making something different, but for all results
[17:37:24] <danheberden> so you'd obviously have to do some index hecking
[17:37:25] <danheberden> *checking
[17:37:27] <bwqbbq> hi
[17:37:30] <bwqbbq> i'm having a prob with this code
[17:37:31] <bwqbbq> https://pastee.org/gfp3f
[17:37:37] <StanAccy> danheberden: ok, so I could, for instance set a style on the "jquery-ui" result and style it with the jquery-ui logo
[17:37:46] <danheberden> yeah exactly
[17:38:00] <danheberden> i did that for a project - 5 of the results were of one type, 5 of another, and 5 of yet another
[17:38:08] <bwqbbq> i have a feeling that the problem lies with the fact that currSrc gets the current source and thus always updates the latest source from the array
[17:38:09] <StanAccy> danheberden: Thanks - Ill have a dig in
[17:38:15] <bwqbbq> instead of the proper sources
[17:38:58] <bwqbbq> so, as soon as those ajax requests finish, it'll set the html of "fea" to those values
[17:39:21] <bwqbbq> just trying to find a way that gets the currSource to stick for that request, and not use the updated value from the current source
[17:39:57] <alex7> hey, I have a an ajax request going to the same page and it works on chrome, but as soon as I try it on an iPad I get an HTTP 403 Forbidden
[17:40:17] <alex7> It's going to a page on the same domain, so no cross site stuff
[17:42:56] <alex7> any ideas?
[17:45:12] <danheberden> alex7 you using the full url or relative?
[17:45:25] <danheberden> e.g. http://whatever.com/file/ or /file/ ?
[17:45:29] <alex7> relative
[17:46:14] <danheberden> is it a logged in kind of thing?
[17:46:24] <alex7> yes
[17:47:14] <alex7> here's what the apache logs say: http://pastebin.com/hZHH18ji
[17:48:41] <alex7> the weird thing is that if I go to the ajax address directly in the iPad browser, it works
[17:52:56] <bwqbbq> oh btw, say i got a var called
[17:53:02] <bwqbbq> var_
[17:53:08] <bwqbbq> and i want to add something to that var
[17:53:12] <bwqbbq> how would i call the var?
[17:54:27] <bwqbbq> like in php you can do fezfzef_{$var}
[17:54:30] <maximedt> are you still thee coldhead ?
[17:57:03] <danheberden> bwqbbq put it in an object
[17:57:21] <coldhead> no maximedt, i have gone out for coffee :(
[17:57:49] <danheberden> ?eval var thingy = { foo: "bar" }, wat = "foo"; if ( thingy[ wat ] ) { thingy[wat]; }
[17:57:50] <bot-t> danheberden: "bar"
[17:58:10] <maximedt> ok, because i have a new little problem ^^
[18:01:22] <bwqbbq> huh danheberden?
[18:01:28] <bwqbbq> not sure how that works
[18:01:35] <bwqbbq> i got
[18:01:37] <bwqbbq> header_a
[18:01:38] <bwqbbq> header_b
[18:01:39] <bwqbbq> etc.
[18:01:51] <bwqbbq> and i got the a, b, etc. in a variable
[18:04:26] <danheberden> so put header_a and header_b in an object
[18:04:43] <danheberden> so it's var headers = { header_a: "whatever", header_b: "whatever2" }
[18:04:54] <danheberden> that way, you can access it's properties via string
[18:05:27] <danheberden> like var whatToGet = 'a'; headers[ 'header_' + whatToGet ]
[18:07:49] <bwqbbq> cool, works now, ty
[18:09:14] <bwqbbq> now i just gotta find out how to make a variable stick for the ajax call :/
[18:11:15] <bwqbbq> is there no way to make a variable static from the moment it gets set
[18:11:17] <bwqbbq> ?
[18:13:52] <coldhead> ?mdc const
[18:13:52] <bot-t> coldhead, const - MDN - Declares a read-only, named constant. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const
[18:14:42] <bwqbbq> thanks, gonna try with that
[18:15:43] <johnywp> i have $('#example').animate({ backgroundColor: '#994E99'}, 1000); and it works
[18:16:03] <johnywp> can i make it animate to a different color once that animation has finished?
[18:17:54] <bwqbbq> hmm damn, i've got no way to get it working :(
[18:18:29] <coldhead> johnywp: $('#example').animate({ backgroundColor: '#994E99'}, 1000, function () {do_another_animate_here()});
[18:18:36] <bwqbbq> the success function of an ajax call only gets called when the query is complete
[18:18:41] <coldhead> callbaaaaack
[18:18:51] <bwqbbq> but i want to insert a variable in the success function of the success function
[18:19:05] <bwqbbq> but i am using a callback
[18:19:17] <johnywp> oh got it - ty coldhead
[18:19:20] <bwqbbq> it's just that when it triggers the callback, the variable that i'm using has already been updated
[18:19:38] <bwqbbq> i'm using $("#search" + sources[src_ctr]).hide();
[18:19:51] <bwqbbq> but it only keeps the latest of that variable
[18:20:02] <bwqbbq> so by the time the ajax call is finished, it doesn't relate to the proper variable anymore
[18:20:13] <coldhead> bwqbbq: you should be able to save off a copy when it has the value you want
[18:20:19] <coldhead> and use the copy in the callback
[18:20:28] <coldhead> danheberden is something of an expert in such matters
[18:21:00] <bwqbbq> yes indeed, that's what i'm trying to do
[18:21:10] <bwqbbq> a copy so that it doesn't get affected by the original, updating variable
[18:22:03] <coldhead> can you paste your code somewhere?
[18:22:07] <bwqbbq> i'm using this right now
[18:22:08] <bwqbbq> http://pastebin.com/Y6PYPQ6W
[18:22:26] <bwqbbq> i'm using a silly counter since that's the only way it doesn't use the latest value
[18:22:43] <bwqbbq> but that obviously doesn't work since the ajax calls don't all stop at the same time everytime
[18:23:19] <bwqbbq> i just have no way to insert the currentSrc variable in the callback
[18:23:34] <bwqbbq> so then by the time the callback kicks in, it's using the last variable in my array
[18:24:00] <coldhead> bwqbbq: http://pastebin.com/A3cTgt41
[18:24:01] <bwqbbq> as a result, all the ajax callbacks use that same variable

[18:24:19] <coldhead> if you use each it will wrap each iteration in a function with local variable
[18:24:20] <coldhead> s
[18:24:26] <alex7> I have a an ajax request going to the same page and it works on chrome, but as soon as I try it on an iPad I get an HTTP 403 Forbidden
[18:24:27] <alex7> It's going to a page on the same domain, so no cross site stuff
[18:24:27] <alex7> the weird thing is that if I go to the ajax address directly in the iPad browser, it works
[18:24:38] <alex7> here's what the apache logs say: https://gist.github.com/1224533
[18:24:48] <coldhead> ?$.each

[18:25:22] <coldhead> that's the actual one i mean
[18:25:30] <webguynow> Wondering about my array of checkboxes named  lr[] and trying to pass the values thru to a $.post()
[18:26:27] <webguynow> I've used .serialize on the form data ( which is only the column of checkboxes ), but man, that serialized data is encoded
[18:26:31] <webguynow> lr%5B%5D=573&lr%5B%5D=581&lr%5B%5D=586&lr%5B%5D=589&lr%5B%5D=595&lr%5B%5D=596
[18:27:03] <webguynow> should I be using .serialize()  ?
[18:27:44] <danzik17> bwqbbq: If I'm understanding you right, see ?pipe
[18:27:45] <bot-t> bwqbbq, deferred.pipe() - Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[18:28:05] <webguynow> I can easily get the array of values, from the 'lr' param.  But my .post call is not picking them up correctly.  Any ideas ?
[18:31:41] <Kamakazi> So I am using several jquery plugins all over my site (ui, simplemodal, qtip, etc) is there any easy way to make sure they get included in all my html files?
[18:32:23] <webguynow> Here's some insight and answers for the array of checkboxes - subject:
[18:32:24] <webguynow> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1197389/serializing-a-checkbox-array
[18:33:13] <bwqbbq> it looks like that did the trick, coldhead
[18:33:14] <bwqbbq> thanks man
[18:33:29] <bwqbbq> i hope it really works and i'm not just lucky to have them finish in the proper order
[18:34:20] <bwqbbq> [03:24:19] <coldhead> if you use each it will wrap each iteration in a function with local variable
[18:34:25] <bwqbbq> that's probably why it's working now :D
[18:34:44] <coldhead> that's one of the reasons why each() exists
[18:34:48] <coldhead> to fix just that problem
[18:38:47] <Aric> i'm having trouble launching a second simplemodal
[18:39:23] <coldhead> modals are the new ajax spinners
[18:40:07] <Aric> well i have a click event and i even tried to just do document.write('foo'); and it wouldn't execute
[18:40:08] <Aric> http://pastie.org/private/l3zf6s86g6i6biqdrpgdq
[18:42:28] <Kamakazi> aric: you can't launch two at once, if that is what you mean
[18:43:11] <Aric> no i have two click events
[18:43:16] <Aric> for different links on the page
[18:45:26] <Kamakazi> for mine I have return false; at the end of the click events
[18:45:45] <Kamakazi> that is pretty much the only difference (I'm haven't messed with them much)
[18:46:22] <coldhead> are you perhaps duplicating IDs on the page?
[18:47:03] <Aric> no duplicate id :/
[18:47:49] <Aric> even if i pluck in a document.write() after:
[18:47:57] <Aric> $(document).ready(function(){
[18:48:01] <Aric> it doesn't execute
[18:48:01] <Aric> :/
[18:48:03] <coldhead> a pox upon document.write()
[18:48:09] <coldhead> its no way to debug
[18:48:15] <coldhead> try console.log()
[18:48:43] <Aric> eh, im admitidly more a backend coder :) let me try that
[18:50:43] <Aric> yea nothings going to console
[18:51:06] <Aric> but the debug message i put in the script.js for my login modal executes np
[18:51:07] <Aric> :/
[18:51:09] <Aric> weird
[18:52:59] <Kamakazi> very
[18:58:49] <a|i> what event to listen to to find out when scrollHeight is changing?

[19:02:42] <coldhead> you have to use that plugin, a|i
[19:03:32] <a|i> coldhead: even for document itself, resize does not work?
[19:03:48] <coldhead> only for the window

[19:05:43] <a|i> that's too sad.
[19:06:07] <cypha> what's a nice and easy ajax tutorial? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ just isn't doing it for me
[19:07:01] <Kamakazi> http://www.xul.fr/en-xml-ajax.html
[19:07:04] <Kamakazi> that is what I used
[19:07:06] <a|i> coldhead: so why is that $(anything).resize exists?
[19:07:29] <Kamakazi> cypha: woops wrong link
[19:07:49] <Kamakazi> that is NOT what you want
[19:07:50] <a|i> you sent porn links.
[19:07:51] <a|i> again.
[19:08:22] <coldhead> a|i: the same reason you can bind to $('p').submit()
[19:08:27] <coldhead> IDK
[19:08:53] <cypha> Kamakazi, so what's the link I want?
[19:09:05] <coldhead> i guess it's there's no obvious way for jQuery to say 'wtf dude, that thing doesn't resize', so it just assumes you have some idea what you're doing
[19:09:35] <Kamakazi> cypha: Apparently the one lost in the ether of my bookmarks
[19:09:45] <cypha> damn
[19:10:36] <cypha> Kamakazi, why don't I want the link you posted?
[19:11:31] <Kamakazi> doesn't use jquery
[19:11:39] <cypha> oh
[19:11:41] <Kamakazi> goes into how to do it without JQuery...which you don't want to do
[19:12:10] <cypha> right
[19:13:03] <Kamakazi> I must have just learned from the link you are looking at, stuff like that is the only stuff that doesn't get bookmarked
[19:13:52] <cypha> any luck with the other bookmark?
[19:14:00] <cypha> or know what it was called so i can start googling?
[19:21:00] <ahandy> though this may sound weird, but does using PHP MVC have an effect on jQuery? A snippet isn't working on a webpage where I use MVC, but it does on a normal one.
[19:21:03] <johnywp> is there a way to toggle the hover effect on a link and then turn/toggle it off?
[19:21:30] <johnywp> as in... if you click here, it's as if you hovered over a different element and then moved the cursor away
[19:23:49] <cypha> does anyone have a good tutorial for ajax?
[19:23:59] <cypha> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ just isn't clicking for me
[19:29:02] <simonleojung> cypha: you could try this http://jqfundamentals.com/book/#chapter-7 but, not sure if you're looking for something a bit more tutorial like
[19:31:32] <johnywp> is there a way to initiate the hover effect of a link by clicking on a different link?
[19:31:45] <johnywp> i am trying to do it with addClass("hover") but it doesn't work
[19:33:55] <coldhead> hover is a pseudo class
[19:34:06] <coldhead> not a regular old class
[19:34:11] <coldhead> so you can't add it
[19:34:13] <coldhead> buuut
[19:34:27] <coldhead> you can do $('thingy').trigger('mouseover')
[19:34:37] <coldhead> and that will make you hover handler fire
[19:43:14] <coldhead> AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT CHAPTER
[19:57:43] <Whirl3d> Hey all. Anybody got a good regex or something that takes care of leading/trailing spaces, non-viewable characters, etc. on input element values? Kind of like (clean(trim(var)) in Excel.
[19:58:02] <coldhead> ?trim
[19:58:02] <bot-t> jQuery.trim(): Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[19:58:14] <coldhead> don't know about cleaning though
[20:01:50] <johnywp> can i activate the hover effect of one element by clicking on other element?
[20:03:05] <coldhead> you can read how i told you to do it above
[20:04:12] <johnywp> oh!! i apologize for that coldhead! thanks so much!
[20:04:15] <johnywp> will try ti
[20:04:16] <johnywp> it*
[20:04:32] <coldhead> good luck!
[20:05:47] <johnywp> tried it.. didn't work, but i think that's because I am not applying it to the right element
[20:06:05] <johnywp> i have <ul><li class=xxx> and I am applying it to .xxx
[20:06:17] <johnywp> is it supposed to work like that?
[20:08:32] <coldhead> what element did you bind the hover() to?
[20:09:04] <coldhead> $('.lol').hover(...); --> $('.lol').trigger('hover')
[20:09:55] <Spadeski> got my domain back today
[20:10:00] <Spadeski> :D
[20:10:05] <coldhead> good work Spadeski

[21:11:29] <borei> im new one with java-scripts and jquery, i have couple questions about lightbox (gallery plugin)
[21:11:51] <borei> i configurdd everything according to the examples and docs
[21:11:56] <borei> looks good
[21:12:23] <borei> but i have only 4 images in the gallery, but lightbox shows 12
[21:12:37] <borei> can't find where it is getting them
[21:12:53] <borei> every image has 2 duplicates
[21:15:46] <borei> anybody ?
[21:39:09] <hExDJ> does anybody know what script they're using for the transition fx on this site:
[21:39:10] <hExDJ> http://themetrust.com/demos/reveal/
[21:39:18] <coldhead> flash?
[21:40:16] <hExDJ> ?
[21:40:39] <hExDJ> it's jQuery, I know that much
[21:43:20] <coldhead> looks like they're using this: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[21:44:47] <hExDJ> thanks coldhead
[21:52:24] <Whirl3d> anybody know off hand what I should look for when I get an error (can't call toLowerCase in jquery 1.6.3...)
[21:52:47] <Whirl3d> I know it's my coding problem, just wondered if anyone else had the same issue and solved it.
[21:52:54] <coldhead> ?eval 'CAPS'.toLowerCase()
[21:52:55] <bot-t> coldhead: "caps"
[21:53:16] <Whirl3d> Yeah, it's not Jquery. It's my script. I just can't figure out where.
[21:53:18] <coldhead> ?eval {not_a_string: {}}.toLowerCase()
[21:53:18] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: syntax error

[21:53:38] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: {not_a_string: 23}.toLowerCase is not a function
[21:54:36] <Whirl3d> the exact error is: uncaught TypeError, can't call toLowerCase on undefined
[21:56:01] <coldhead> so the thing before the . is undefined
[21:56:05] <coldhead> what is it and what should it be
[21:56:17] <coldhead> ?eval var x = undefined; x.toLowerCase();
[21:56:17] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: x is undefined
[21:56:25] <Whirl3d> Found my error. I was calling .trim() on an invalid selector
[21:56:32] <coldhead> good work
[21:56:42] <Whirl3d> ?eval $.trim($("something"))
[21:56:42] <bot-t> Whirl3d: TypeError: (text || "").replace is not a function
[21:57:09] <Whirl3d> thanks for the help (as always) coldhead.
[21:57:28] <coldhead> hey you fixed it yourself :P
[22:00:25] <cypha> does anyone have a good tutorial for ajax?
[22:00:28] <cypha> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ just isn't clicking for me

How can i do something like that?
[22:24:36] <Whirl3d> is there a way to select only elements that have children of a specific type?  Like all divs that have input elements in them?
[22:59:58] <kurol> you can select those inputs then back out
[23:00:14] <kurol> most likely using .closest()
[23:02:18] <johnywp> hey all
[23:02:41] <johnywp> i was here before but my computer crashed so i didn't get a chance to see if anybody replied to my question :(
[23:03:11] <johnywp> i am using     $('.our-reviews-link').click(function () {$('#menu-item-5 a').trigger('mouseover'); });
[23:03:51] <johnywp> in an effort to make <li id="menu-item-5"><a href=".."></a> go into hover effect when the first element is clicked
[23:03:58] <johnywp> do you see any problem with this code?
[23:04:28] <kurol> well it won't work if you're using the :hover pseudoselector to do the effect
[23:04:43] <johnywp> ohhh
[23:04:47] <johnywp> i am
[23:05:21] <kurol> i guess... you should toggle a class
[23:05:23] <johnywp> but wouldn't mouseover activate any effects that would happen in the case of a mouseover?
[23:05:49] <johnywp> any way you could show me the basic syntax on how to do that?
[23:05:53] <kurol> and in your css, add that class to your :hover definition
[23:06:07] <johnywp> say i create a class for links in menu-item-5
[23:06:08] <johnywp> yeap
[23:06:40] <johnywp> and then  {$('#menu-item-5 a').toggle what?
[23:06:44] <johnywp> .xxx?
[23:08:01] <kurol> hmm, do you need to undo the hover effect? or once you click on .our-review-link taht menu gets highlighted
[23:08:11] <johnywp> basically
[23:08:26] <johnywp> i have a menu list (ul) with 5 items (li)
[23:08:44] <johnywp> i want to make it so that they get hovered one after the other
[23:08:59] <johnywp> so 1st li highlight, then off, then 2nd li highlight, then off, then.....
[23:09:00] <kurol> like an animation?
[23:09:06] <johnywp> sort of
[23:09:56] <johnywp> from the first to the last 1-2-3-4-5 and for each of them i want them to be hovered and "unhovered"
[23:10:13] <johnywp> i am just trying to find a cool way to attract attention to them
[23:10:28] <kurol> well i guess the first step is to make a function that just does that effect
[23:11:03] <johnywp> toggleclass could work right?
[23:11:26] <kurol> yeah
[23:11:34] <kurol> combine with an animation queue
[23:11:34] <johnywp> or maybe add class and remove class
[23:11:47] <johnywp> but how would i untoggle it?
[23:11:58] <johnywp> just toggle again after toggling?
[23:12:17] <kurol> yeah
[23:12:29] <kurol> i'd probably end up using addClass and removeClass explicitly
[23:12:45] <kurol> but i might try it out using toggleClass to begin with
[23:12:53] <johnywp> can i set a delay when using addclass and removeclass?
[23:13:06] <johnywp> so that it's a little bit more fluid?
[23:13:26] <kurol> .delay only works if you've started an animation queue, which means using one of the effects
[23:13:35] <kurol> and messing with classes doesn't do that
[23:13:39] <johnywp> oh i see
[23:13:43] <johnywp> ok let me try and see
[23:13:44] <johnywp> :)
[23:13:47] <kurol> maybe good old setTimeout will work
[23:14:14] <kurol> yeah... setTimeOut
[23:14:17] <johnywp> trying it with sinple add and remove
[23:14:33] <johnywp> to see how it looks
[23:14:34] <johnywp> 1 sec
[23:17:21] <aniasis> I am trying to access top.window.location cross protocol but IE 8 is giving me a permission denied
[23:18:34] <kurol> i'm pretty sure you're out of luck if you're looking for an easy answer
[23:18:54] <kurol> sounds like cross-domain stuff
[23:22:37] <johnywp> ok
[23:22:42] <johnywp> i managed to toggle them all
[23:22:46] <johnywp> :P
[23:22:55] <kurol> toggle woggle
[23:22:58] <johnywp> i could then untoggle them and it would be link a blink effec
[23:22:59] <johnywp> t
[23:23:03] <johnywp> lol
[23:23:09] <kurol> oooh, yeah!
[23:23:12] <kurol> do it!
[23:23:32] <johnywp> how could i use timeout though to achieve the fluid one-by-one effect?
[23:24:00] <kurol> you'd have to chain it
[23:24:17] <johnywp> hmmm actually
[23:24:27] <johnywp> if i toggle and then toggle again... there is no blink lol
[23:24:28] <kurol> or... I guess you could juset use math
[23:24:40] <johnywp> since there is no delay
[23:24:41] <johnywp> lol
[23:24:57] <johnywp> do this + undo it = never happened
[23:24:57] <kurol> setTimeout(blinkfunction, i*delay)
[23:25:07] <johnywp> hmm
[23:25:12] <johnywp> 1 sec
[23:25:42] <kurol> need another setTimeout to undo the hover effect for each li
[23:25:45] <johnywp> http://jsfiddle.net/YqXgL/
[23:25:47] <johnywp> this is what i have
[23:25:54] <johnywp> at the moment
[23:26:07] <johnywp> not sure how to syntax the setTimeout
[23:27:08] <kurol> ?mdc setTimeout
[23:27:08] <bot-t> kurol, window.setTimeout - MDN - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.setTimeout
[23:27:40] <johnywp> thank you for that
[23:28:08] <johnywp> i was reading it a minute ago but couldn't figure out how to implement it in my function
[23:28:28] <kurol> my attention span isn't the greatest right now
[23:28:40] <johnywp> ideally.. i would do something like toggle(), setTimeout(), toggle(), setTimeout()
[23:28:49] <johnywp> can i use it in such a way?
[23:28:58] <johnywp> like, do this, wait, do that, wait..
[23:29:03] <kurol> yeah
[23:29:16] <johnywp> ok
[23:29:18] <kurol> eventually, you should use a loop
[23:29:21] <johnywp> so, if i have this $('#menu-item-5 a').toggleClass('highlight-hover'),
[23:29:23] <kurol> to go through each one
[23:29:52] <johnywp> i should, but it's much easier to add it manually at the moment (not really a jquery expert as you can tell lol)
[23:30:31] <johnywp> say i am toggling from menu-item-5 to item 5
[23:30:34] <johnywp> 10*
[23:31:24] <johnywp> would i do $('#menu-item-5 a').toggleClass('highlight-hover'),.setTimeout(x), $('#menu-item-6 a').toggleClass('highlight-hover'),.setTimeout(x)............?
[23:32:27] <kurol> well i guess technically everything would be in a setTimeout since you want them to go off one by one
[23:33:25] <johnywp> can i set a setTimeout between EVERY event in my function by simply wrapping my function around a setTimeout?
[23:33:34] <kurol> setTimeout($('#menu-item-5 a').toggleClass('highlight-hover'), 0); setTimeout($('#menu-item-5 a').toggleClass('highlight-hover'), 500);
[23:33:39] <aniasis> is window.bind === window.attachEvent?
[23:33:57] <johnywp> got it!! ty :)
[23:34:02] <kurol> first one doesn't have to be in a setTimeout but it will make it easier to generalize all of them if they look the same
[23:34:06] <johnywp> yeap
[23:34:14] <johnywp> they do
[23:37:37] * kurol *poof*
[23:41:05] <johnywp> kurol, can you please take a really quick look at my syntax?
[23:41:19] <johnywp> it doesn't seem to work but I am almost certain that it's a syntax error
[23:41:48] <johnywp> http://jsfiddle.net/YqXgL/1/
[23:53:43] <webguynow> onLoad equivalent is  ?? $(window).load(function() {}   ?
[23:53:54] <webguynow> is that right ?
[23:54:00] <johnywp> can anybody see what the mistake in this code is? http://jsfiddle.net/YqXgL/1/
[23:54:14] <jfernandez> what does the .el method return
