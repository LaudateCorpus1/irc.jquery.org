[05:57:51] <donquijote> hi there
[06:00:02] <donquijote> I'm looking for a way to built a text editor that can has text as well as placeholders that can be filled with some data. Is there a way to achieve this in jQuery?
[06:01:41] <AdamPDotty> Yes, you can manipulate text with Javascript.
[06:33:50] <donquijote> AdamPDotty: I'm thinking of something like you can see here https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gBZDoi9l_1vxjzk1DtCxgElJdwK8Y2hu1tRdQWDXujG_nn_pWxut-93Lqlt822EbRxebrr-dtb6O_IY_MKmU4hOhc4q9Byc0Z4Vec10xSdL0SSWdqNg3U15lDvC2-e56ein6nRfN
[06:35:17] <donquijote> But I'm stuck with on how to start. Is it a textarea field or just a div box where I can place the content?
[06:41:16] <donquijote> AdamPDotty: do you think this is possible with jQuery as well and how could I start?
[08:37:30] <donquijote> Hi again
[08:37:55] <donquijote> Found a first approach to my issue: https://jsfiddle.net/ca7j9ost/
[08:38:28] <donquijote> But now I do not get on with the text being inserted into the text at the cursor position.
[08:38:35] <donquijote> Any ideas how to do that?
[09:06:19] <donquijote> anyone having an approach to that?
