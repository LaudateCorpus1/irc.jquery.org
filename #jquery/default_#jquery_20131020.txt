[00:39:13] <sahbeewah> kilian123, you request json data...
[00:46:10] <suarez> can be done a responsive navbar only with sass or its always needed a jquery or js?
[00:47:39] <sahbeewah> suarez, you can use sass/css
[00:47:47] <jphase> suarez: responsive design can be done entirely with css; a navbar is no different
[00:48:03] <jphase> what suarez said ^
[00:48:16] <jphase> er
[00:48:23] <jphase> sahbeewah*
[00:48:28] <suarez> ok perfect, i try responsive navbar jqueries and don't like what i find
[01:07:05] <jop007> is it possible to have an wysiwyg editor and test if it is possbile. An iPad will not have this element I guess
[01:12:41] <jphase> jop007: I don't understand the question, what do you mean "test if it is possible?"
[01:13:26] <jop007> To see if the device is ready for rich text editing
[01:19:48] <jphase> jop007: do you mean specifically content ediable? If that's the case, then you're asking for a method to check if the browser supports HTML5 then yes?
[01:20:17] <jop007> maybe markitup is a good one?
[01:20:45] <jphase> jop007: modernizr will allow you to check for HTML5 support and is standardly used by many developers
[01:21:35] <jphase> oh, you want an actual wysiwyg editor?
[01:22:01] <jphase> sure, you could use markitup or redactor or raptor or tinyMCE etc. etc. etc.
[01:24:36] <erisco> <a href="home.html#foo">link</a>  I'd expect this to load home.html and go to the 'foo' page (mobile ui). however, the link simply does nothing
[01:24:52] <erisco> if I remove '#foo' then it goes to home.html, but not to the 'foo' page
[01:29:48] <jop007> does modernizer work on iphone?
[01:31:27] <ravenzz> yep
[01:31:37] <ravenzz> it is javascript man

[03:25:16] <ashnur> hi. I am wondering how hard it would be to write a compiler to rewrite jquery to vanilla... what do you think?
[03:31:55] <Armistice> Can you pass css as a parameter to the jquery constructor? eg: $("foo", { id : "bar", css : { height : ..., width : ... } }).things
[03:51:34] <shoky> Armistice: yes
[04:02:29] <ph88> hey shoky would you mind taking a look at this  http://jsfiddle.net/H7Gk3/  ?
[04:06:50] <shoky> ph88: it's a jsfiddle issue. choose jQuery 2.0.2
[04:07:08] <shoky> (not edge)
[04:07:30] <XaroRSA> Hi peeps
[04:08:13] <XaroRSA> I gave the following function
[04:08:13] <XaroRSA>   $("#Submit").click(function() {  	feedselect = $("#feedselect").val(); 	var fromdate =$( "#date3" ).val(); 	var todate = $( "#date4" ).val(); 	$.get(path+'DataDownload/cocks', { feedid: feedselect, date3: fromdate, date4: todate }
[04:08:34] <XaroRSA> it loads the correct url, but i want it to open that url with that data sent to it
[04:09:12] <XaroRSA> example when i open the page thats gets sent manually it works, but i want it to open that url automaticly
[04:09:18] <XaroRSA> Any help on how to do that/
[04:09:23] <shoky> XaroRSA: it should send that data as url query params
[04:10:44] <shoky> XaroRSA: is #Submit an actual submit button for a <form> ?
[04:11:19] <XaroRSA> yes it is a form but i just extracted the data
[04:11:33] <shoky> maybe the form is being submitted, then
[04:11:33] <XaroRSA> o but no
[04:11:39] <XaroRSA> the button
[04:11:45] <XaroRSA> is not a submit type
[04:12:13] <shoky> that doesn't always matter
[04:12:23] <XaroRSA> this is the url that gets sent and works when i manually open it
[04:12:25] <XaroRSA> Gcocks?feedid=11&date3=2013-09-08&date4=2013-10-19
[04:12:48] <ph88> shoky: i get the same error with jQuery 2.0.2
[04:13:12] <shoky> ph88: select jQuery 2.0.2 and jQuery UI 1.10.3
[04:13:15] <shoky> works for me..
[04:13:26] <shoky> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/H7Gk3/1/
[04:14:45] <ph88> oh sorry i forgot to enable jQuery UI that second time :|\
[04:14:51] <ph88> thx shoky
[04:54:19] <XaroRSA> Ok, is there a way i can build the url path with variables eg location?feedid=11&date3=2013-09-08&date4=2013-10-19, then just open that url the same page?
[04:54:33] <XaroRSA> something like window.open(url)?
[05:18:34] <g33kyboi> hi
[05:19:56] <g33kyboi> Can someone tell if fancybox pluggin has an implementation of a request confirmation interface ( like display a Yes/No screen)?
[05:23:27] <Vis3r> got a question.. is it possible adding a row to the table if i don't know how many columns it has?.. i mean automatically add as much columns in it as there are in the table.. is there a function for that? or what's the fastest way to do it?
[05:27:43] <frank_o> Anybody familiar with Weinre?
[05:28:11] <sahbeewah> Vis3r, not efficiently + correctly, i don't think. why would you need that, anyway?
[05:35:27] <NielsNL> Hello all, i have a small issue with http://jsfiddle.net/dW9Kc/ where the menu item is showing inside the toolbar and are way to width.
[05:38:55] <Vis3r> sahbeewah .. cause i'm extending a plugin for datatables.. and the plugin creates the table.. i just want to add a nother row to the header
[05:39:01] <Vis3r> for my plugin data to live in
[05:40:36] <sahbeewah> clone an existing row
[05:42:26] <Vis3r> yeh that's what i'm doing now.. thought there might be a better way
[05:42:32] <Vis3r> i'll keep it this way then :)
[05:48:10] <freedrull> why does this $(this).position().left give me this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'position' in undefined
[05:50:23] <richwestcoast> freedrull in this context what is $(this) ?
[05:51:40] <freedrull> sorry, its a loop over each: $(".scroller").each(function(){
[05:56:55] <richwestcoast> ah so u trying to get the slide to the left?
[05:57:17] <richwestcoast> freedrull
[06:08:32] <frank_o> Anybody know how to debug JS in BrowserStack emulations?
[06:26:35] <Asad> Anyone can think of a way to limit jquery-ui resizable to predefined widths? For example, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% would be the only options. Snap to grid doesn't really work here.
[07:09:38] <richwestcoast> why is google chrome so much better at doing google maps than firefox?
[07:10:23] <richwestcoast> im thinking of moving to google chrome because of it
[07:27:00] <jedimind> richwestcoast: you dont know the answer to that question?
[07:48:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have a bunch of javascript files in a subdirectory... in my root.js I need to to load on of the js files in that subdirectory, depending on a parameter... what is the best way to do this?
[07:48:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> one*
[07:54:21] <Ericx2x> can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/j3h4t/
[07:54:35] <Ericx2x> I'm trying to get it so when you hover over it with your mouse the background image changes
[07:57:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ericx2x: http://adapt2.erictheprogrammer.com/images/hoverbackground.png
[07:57:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> there isnothing there and your html is messed up
[07:58:15] <Ericx2x> ecky
[07:58:17] <Ericx2x> click on it
[07:58:20] <Ericx2x> there is an image
[07:58:23] <Ericx2x> 1 px width
[07:58:36] <Ericx2x> ecky--ptang-zoob
[07:58:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ah ok
[08:00:11] <Ericx2x> if you do regular css with that image it looks fine but i want to write jquery so that css only appears when hover event happens
[08:00:33] <Ericx2x> regular css as in use background: url('insert image');
[08:00:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok sec
[08:01:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/j3h4t/3/
[08:01:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> seems to work
[08:02:59] <Ericx2x> thanks
[08:02:59] <Ericx2x> hm, one more thing how do you make it so when the mouse leaves the div it returns to normal?
[08:04:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/j3h4t/3/
[08:05:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but why is your div inside your a ?
[08:05:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> just make your link a block element if you want it to be a box
[08:05:59] <Ericx2x> you linked the same thing twice
[08:06:28] <Ericx2x> and you mean do display:block on my anchor tag?
[08:06:38] <Ericx2x> ecky--ptang-zoob
[08:06:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> O sorry, this I meant: http://jsfiddle.net/j3h4t/4/
[08:07:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes display:block
[08:07:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> then you can give your link a width too
[08:08:16] <JesperA> why use jQuery at all for changing bg image?
[08:08:41] <Ericx2x> JesperA is there a non jQuery way of doing it?
[08:08:47] <Ericx2x> i dont know the css way
[08:09:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ericx2x: everything in jquery can be done with plain js ;)
[08:09:23] <Ericx2x> lol
[08:09:23] <Ericx2x> i know
[08:09:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but you can use a:hover
[08:09:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> to change background, that's just css
[08:09:38] <Ericx2x> ah
[08:09:41] <Ericx2x> ok
[08:09:44] <Ericx2x> thanks
[08:10:09] <richwestcoast> jedimind: your not serious?
[08:10:49] <jedimind> what
[08:11:07] <krambiorix> hi, i have some kind of excel like form... all rows have a text input field to store a number....when one number field changes i want to redo some calculations for the other fields.  So i would store the calculations like this   data-calc= "52526cf18cc8c + 52526cf18c8cc + 52526cf18ca56 - 52526cf18cfb4"   which are all the id's of the other input fields.... How can i reform that string to $("#52526cf18cc8c").val() + $("#52526cf18c8cc") ........
[08:11:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is there a way with an ajax call to handle a 404 without displaying an error in the console?
[08:11:48] <richwestcoast> about google maps on firefox
[08:12:07] <jedimind> richwestcoast:  i was just wondering why you were surprised that a service built by google is optimized to be used by a browser built by google
[08:12:25] <jedimind> but i digress, i may have been a little snarky about it
[08:12:41] <richwestcoast> is it on purpose surely that is antittrust?
[08:13:13] <jedimind> they didnt purposely make it work shitty in firefox
[08:13:27] <krambiorix> anyone?
[08:24:42] <freedrull> richwestcoast: to the right
[08:25:51] <richwestcoast> yes i think position is based on a horizontal basis
[08:26:00] <richwestcoast> cos its probably just a <li> item
[08:26:04] <krambiorix> so how can i get    "52526cf18cc8c + 52526cf18c8cc + 52526cf18ca56 - 52526cf18cfb4"   to   $("#52526cf18cc8c").val() + $("#52526cf18c8cc").val() + $("#52526cf18ca56").val() - $("#52526cf18cfb4").val()   and to execute it?
[08:27:21] <freedrull> wat?
[08:28:25] <krambiorix> i store "52526cf18cc8c + 52526cf18c8cc + 52526cf18ca56 - 52526cf18cfb4"  in data-calc .... How can i parse it to become something like $("#52526cf18cc8c").val() + $("#52526cf18c8cc").val() + $("#52526cf18ca56").val() - $("#52526cf18cfb4").val()   and perform that calculation?
[08:31:11] <Vis3r> this is bad.. and you should feel bad
[08:34:54] <imjacobclark> I'm interested in helping out with zapping some jQuery bugs, however I'm unable to find any bug tracking software bar Triage, is this where bugs are reported and it is within here that patches and proposed fixes should be posted?
[08:35:02] <krambiorix> Vis3r, i know, but i don't see other solutions.... Any suggestion?
[08:37:26] <Vis3r> don't save them this way?
[08:37:49] <jedimind> Vis3r:  if you have a better solution, provide it
[08:38:24] <jedimind> krambiorix:  it just seems like an overly backwards way of doing it, is there no way you can leverage some of that logic in the back end ?
[08:38:40] <jedimind> create a webservice or something that you can send off the calculation to and get a result
[08:38:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I use date.js - does anyone know why this results in null? Date.parse("2013-10-11T06:51:29+02:00")
[08:40:01] <krambiorix> jedimind, the backend doesn't know the actual values.... Ok i can send them with ajax, but still... Then i have to recalculate all fields
[08:43:15] <TigerParket> I'm sure here you know the best jQuery full width responsive slider

[09:41:18] <nmee> Hi, can I ask about jquery plugin development here or is there a better suited channel for that?
[09:49:31] <grafi> here is probably fine
[09:50:48] <nmee> Seems so, was expecting more traffic here with the massive user list :) Thanks
[09:52:50] <nmee> I'm creating a stateful plugin that I initialize with $('.class').myPlugin(); - is there a best practice for how I can signal my plugin after initialization?
[09:54:03] <nmee> Can I for example use  $('.class').myPlugin.someSignal(); ?
[10:11:18] <brettfrable> I've been job hunting lately.
[10:11:34] <brettfrable> whats the average salary for a decent front end dev
[10:11:46] <brettfrable> especially in places like new york, dc, etc.
[10:43:16] <hugo_moss> if i create a jquery object, and there are no matches in the dom, how can i test that the variable has no matches?
[10:43:23] <hugo_moss> will it be undefined or null?
[10:46:41] <sonOfRa> hugo_moss, if($("#selector").length == 0) {console.log("it's empty!");}
[11:03:11] <hugo_moss> sonofra: thanks
[11:09:16] <LoneSoldier728> hey anyone know why my localstorage is saving two key value pairs
[11:09:33] <LoneSoldier728> the first key being correct with a random generated number/char for the value
[11:09:50] <LoneSoldier728> and then the second key being the first key + the first value and the second value being correct
[11:10:33] <LoneSoldier728> .val()
[11:10:33] <b-ot> LoneSoldier728: for form fields

[11:12:24] <unsung> hi
[11:12:50] <unsung> I'm trying to get the value of a selected radio button in a button group using .getJSON
[11:13:06] <unsung> this is what I have now http://pastebin.com/ywujBJMr I need to assign the value to a
[11:16:58] <unsung> am I in the right channel for this?
[11:46:23] <ex0a> what's the proper way to specify #radioidname within a div with #dividname when trying to capture clicks?
[11:46:28] <unsung> anyone that can help me getting the value from an active radio button?
[11:46:45] <unsung> ex0a, I'm having a similar question
[11:47:24] <ex0a> unsung: $("#id").val() or $(".class").val() i think
[11:47:38] <ex0a> not sure that works with radio buttons though
[11:47:59] <unsung> I'll give it a shot
[11:48:03] <unsung> thanks
[11:48:03] <ex0a> tjat'
[11:48:05] <ex0a> err
[11:48:19] <ex0a> that's what i use to pull from <select> though
[11:49:58] <shoky> ex0a: if the radio has an id you can just use that
[11:51:04] <ex0a> would each radio button need a separate id? i've tried with them all using the same id and it doesn't trigger .click like it does when i use the surrounding div's id
[11:51:51] <nmee> I usually use $('.radioclass:selected').val()
[11:52:03] <shoky> if you have many radios it's better to give them a shared class and delegate the event to the div e.g.  $('#div_id').on('click', '.radioclass', ...)
[11:52:19] <ex0a> ahh very nice
[11:52:27] <nmee> or :checked I mean
[11:52:36] <ex0a> and thanks nmee i'm going to need that shortly :]
[11:53:02] <morris4> hi. if i have a jquery object x, can i rename a tag without actually creating a new node and replacing the old node?
[11:53:11] <nmee> I can also use $('#myRadio').is(':checked')
[11:54:29] <shoky> morris4: i don't think you can change tag types
[11:56:51] <morris4> shoky, ok, thank you

[11:57:51] <nmee> err... rookie mistake, sorry
[11:57:58] <nmee> shoky: didn't mean to paste at all... damn right-click paste in putty
[11:58:03] <shoky> s'ok

[12:12:10] <|PiP|> im writing a chrome extension using jquery to automate some behaviour on a page. is there a way to check to see if there are any ajax requests that haven't finished processing yet before moving on to the next step?
[12:16:29] <Cork> |PiP|: no, there is no list of ongoing ajax calls
[12:16:51] <Cork> you would have to save references to the xhr object the call was made with to check that
[12:17:04] <Cork> (or jqxhr object)
[12:18:01] <andryanmiller> Check out ajaxStop: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStop/
[12:18:18] <LoneSoldier728> any localstorage gurus here know why when i store something to it, a two keys and values
[12:18:20] <LoneSoldier728> are created
[12:34:25] <ra1n> Hi. How can i add a link to switch between the next and previous list-item images
[12:48:15] <drvanon> Hey guys, I was working on this pen: http://codepen.io/Drvanon/pen/gcGjv, when toggle stopped working. Anybody an idea why this might happen?
[12:50:16] <drvanon> $().toggle works one time on the first div, but doesn't toggle back. and the second div doesn't react at all.
[13:08:33] <katsh> when i call a function inside .done() like so   .done(cart.addToCart)  how do i pass parameters to the function being called?
[13:13:44] <frank_o> Hey! jQuery Mobile seems to recommend binding ones JS to pageinit instead of DOM ready(). But how come that breaks this dropdown menu? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/
[13:18:47] <shoky> frank_o: because you have "onLoad" selected in jsfiddle on the left, so it runs your page only after the load event
[13:19:02] <shoky> change it to "No wrap - in <body>"
[13:20:38] <frank_o> shoky: Pretty cool, thanks :)
[13:21:04] <shoky> katsh: by default the function will receive the parameters that the promise was resolved with (e.g. the response data, for an ajax request)
[13:21:16] <frank_o> shoky: Any idea how to make this work locally though?
[13:21:37] <shoky> frank_o: it should work locally because you're not doing it onLoad locally, i assume
[13:22:25] <katsh> shoky: anyway to override that default?
[13:22:34] <shoky> katsh: but you can always proxy the function with a bound function using .bind e.g.  .done(cart.addToCart.bind(cart, arg1, arg2))
[13:23:48] <shoky> frank_o: er when i said "it runs your page" i meant "it runs your code" ;p
[13:23:51] <katsh> I see. thanks
[13:24:09] <frank_o> shoky: Oh!
[13:24:24] <frank_o> shoky: Can I throw together a testcase real quick?
[13:24:42] <frank_o> like a static HTML to see what happens
[13:24:50] <shoky> uhm yea?
[13:25:18] <frank_o> :P
[13:27:11] <visua> o/ This maybe a CSS thing, but i figured I would try here since it has to do with a jquery plugin.

[13:28:04] <visua> So on this page, you can see there is a label of info on each slide. This works okay on the initial slide, however if you page to the next slide the information doesn't display. If you resize, it displays – if you try to highlight the text, it displays.
[13:28:09] <visua> Very weird.
[13:28:25] <visua> It was only happening in Safari at first, but it's happening in chrome now as well
[13:33:03] <frank_o> shoky: Here's the single HTML page that I created and ran locally but once I bind it to pageinit the smart columns stop working: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qsEXn/
[13:36:27] <shoky> frank_o: i dunno, seems fine to me.. and it works here
[13:37:40] <shoky> frank_o: it's also working for me locally when i copy/paste your code into a blank html file
[13:38:41] <shoky> visua: weird stuff. looks like a rendering bug
[13:38:51] <visua> indeed :\
[13:39:55] <frank_o> shoky: If you comment the pageinit and uncomment the dom ready, you'll see that the first dropdown menu will start organizing itself into columns (assuming its content is bigger than your page which it most likely is)
[13:40:52] <shoky> frank_o: oh
[13:42:03] <frank_o> Yep
[13:42:06] <frank_o> Pretty fond of this snippet
[13:44:12] <shoky> frank_o: i donno jquery mobile too much, but it seems that the page* events are used because typically jqmobile pages are loaded via ajax, and so using doc.ready doesn't help
[13:44:48] <shoky> frank_o: but in your case you have the static html already there, and it seems the pageinit event is fired BEFORE the doc.ready is fired
[13:45:12] <shoky> and i suppose the plugin(s) you're using are waiting for doc.ready till they do their stuff
[13:45:18] <shoky> so you need to also
[13:45:27] <shoky> or something like that :S
[13:45:44] <frank_o> shoky: Cool, that's definitely a clue
[13:46:28] <frank_o> shoky: Prior to moving all my JS to pageinit, things would only work on my front page, once moving over to other jQuery Mobile pages, not so much
[13:46:51] <frank_o> * once transitioning to other jQuery Mobile pages, not so much
[13:46:53] <visua> -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; this fixed it
[13:46:55] <visua> interestingly
[13:48:18] <shoky> visua: heh yeah i remember now that property fixed a similar render bug i ran into once. tho in my case it was left-over artifacts from the animation which weren't properly cleared
[13:48:34] <visua> funky
[13:49:37] <frank_o> shoky: As for the plugins, hoverIntent works fine in pageinit it seems. The other, jQuery Visible, one can just uncomment, it does not seem to be the cause of the problem.
[14:02:55] <shoky> frank_o: why do you have this line..  if(!$this.visible()) {
[14:04:20] <frank_o> shoky: That's safe to comment out. It's to check whether the dropdown menu is larger than the page. If it is, organize it into columns, if not, skip it.
[14:07:55] <ingof> hi, has anybody a idea how http://bluepeneditor.com/ parses the CSS file to list the computed styles on a selected element ?
[14:18:21] <shoky> uhm their "try it out" is all buggy - i got tons of rulers filling the screen
[14:18:41] <ingof> yep, you can disable the rulers then it works
[14:19:35] <shoky> how
[14:19:55] <ingof> click on the first "i" icon
[14:20:12] <ingof> and then you get a settings panel where you can switch rulers off
[14:20:42] <shoky> that didn't help much.. other junk is filling the screen now
[14:20:53] <ingof> really ?
[14:20:55] <shoky> yeh
[14:21:01] <ingof> mumpf
[14:22:12] <ingof> i'm on chrome and it works - but a similar editor is http://www.skybound.ca/ it works like bluepens editor but it's a app
[14:23:12] <shoky> i'm on chrome too
[14:23:16] <ingof> shoky: do you have layer seletion mode turned off ?
[14:23:41] <shoky> i turned the whole thing off.. no further inclination to deal with that junk ;p
[14:24:11] <shoky> and i donno - i didn't do anything except disable the rulers
[14:25:07] <ingof> hm
[14:26:26] <ingof> i have the layer select mode turned off - maybe that help
[14:27:11] <ingof> but anyway - do you have any idea how the do this kind of dom element selection + mapping to style file ?
[14:31:54] <shoky> donno what you mean exactly
[14:34:50] <ingof> you can select an element on the page with the selection tool - then on the CSS panel they can display the styles used for the selected element and the file in which the styles were defined
[14:35:32] <ingof> i dont understand how they can get the mapping between selection tool and style definition
[14:36:38] <tw2113> a lot more complex code than jquery?
[14:47:30] <ingof> FYI - this is the solution i think
[14:47:31] <ingof> http://www.brothercake.com/site/resources/scripts/cssutilities/
[16:10:42] <Ericx2x> can someone tell me why i can't get the same jquery fade in effect as scrolling happens?
[16:10:47] <Ericx2x> I'm trying to work off of a site that has it
[16:10:56] <Ericx2x> but for some reason I can't replicate it and I don't know why
[16:10:56] <Ericx2x> http://adayinbigdata.com/ http://resume.erictheprogrammer.com/
[16:37:29] <santiissopasse> Is there a way to tell if a loaded page is being directed to another page, i.e. my page is loaded, I click a link and now its loading the next page
[16:40:13] <shoky> santiissopasse: there's only the window's beforeunload event that you can listen for, and mostly what you can do there is just show a standard confirmation dialog for leaving the page
[16:40:37] <shoky> of course, you could also catch the clicks for the links if you want
[16:41:56] <santiissopasse> shoky: I have a site that takes a bit of time to load between pages, I just want to throw a loading spinner on when you click on an <a> that' takes you to another page, but I dont want to select by <a> bc I'm using bootstrap and have a bunch of non href anchors. That's why I wanted to see if there was just an event I could listen for. Any idea how i could do this using beforeunload?
[16:42:25] <shoky> you can't
[16:42:44] <shoky> what do you mean by non-href anchors
[16:43:23] <admintheturtle> hello guys, how can i trigger an alert in an hidden input field when its value changes ?
[16:43:49] <shoky> another common way to go is to use ajax for navigation, then you have full control
[16:45:02] <shoky> admintheturtle: do the alert wherever you're changing the value. you can't listen for value changes on a hidden input afaik
[16:47:15] <admintheturtle> really? but i can make an alert for its value when i load the page
[16:48:23] <shoky> you can make an alert for its value whenever you want
[16:48:29] <shoky> but you can't listen for value changes
[16:48:54] <admintheturtle> I'm trying to use this http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/
[16:49:12] <admintheturtle> i want to show a div when i select a specify item
[16:49:12] <shoky> ok
[16:49:48] <admintheturtle> but since the input that has that value and its hidden i can't make that? or is there any workaround?
[16:50:13] <santiissopasse> shoky: I mean that I have anchor tags that don't have an href attribute or whose href = "#" or "", I guess I can select all $("a[href]") and then filter out matches that have href = "" or "#", but I'm just wondering if there's a more precise way to do it, i.e. by  knowing when the page is changing
[16:53:05] <shoky> admintheturtle:  well you need click handlers. typically a plugin like that would let you set them easily, but this one doesn't seem to as it's focused on the presentation
[16:53:33] <admintheturtle> can i do for a span text instead of input?
[16:54:13] <shoky> santiissopasse: sorry, i donno bootstrap
[16:54:31] <shoky> admintheturtle: wat?
[16:55:17] <admintheturtle> <span>text</span> can i alert when that text changes?
[16:55:40] <shoky> no, you're thinking about the wrong approaches
[16:55:45] <admintheturtle> hummm
[16:55:51] <admintheturtle> I'm completely stuck
[17:00:29] <shoky> admintheturtle: you can edit the .js script.  look for this line:  self.inputEl.val( opt.data( 'value' ) )     change it to:   self.inputEl.val( opt.data( 'value' ) ).trigger('change');
[17:00:41] <shoky> admintheturtle: then you can just do .on('change'  on the input
[17:01:22] <santiissopasse> shoky: bootstrap itself is not relevant, the only relevant point is that it uses <a> elements as containers
[17:01:25] <admintheturtle> ok let me check
[17:01:34] <santiissopasse> is there any way to know that the page is loading, the same way that chrome tells you "waiting for URL"
[17:01:36] <santiissopasse> at the bottom
[17:02:27] <shoky> told you a way to do that, but it doesn't let you do anything in the event handler except return a message for the confirmation dialog
[17:02:30] <admintheturtle> shoky: i've changed that so how can i alert now?
[17:02:52] <shoky> admintheturtle:  handle the change event on the input..
[17:03:07] <admintheturtle> nice it works
[17:03:15] <admintheturtle> thank you
[17:03:22] <shoky> np
[17:03:24] <admintheturtle> this is the beginning
[17:04:00] <admintheturtle> now i need to show a div class="value" with that change
[17:04:21] <admintheturtle> I'm going to get this done
[17:04:27] <admintheturtle> thank you for everything
[17:04:46] <shoky> bon voyage
[17:10:25] <admintheturtle> me again… I'm trying to use this:    $('.countrylist' + value ).show();       value is a class, how to put this right?
[17:11:52] <admintheturtle> well maybe this… $('.'value ).show();
[17:12:00] <admintheturtle> value is a class
[17:12:05] <admintheturtle> is it possible?
[17:12:49] <admintheturtle> if found it
[17:12:50] <admintheturtle> $('.'+value ).show();
[17:12:53] <admintheturtle> thank man
[17:12:57] <admintheturtle> wow
[17:13:07] <admintheturtle> 9 hours to discover this
[17:13:13] <admintheturtle> thank you so much
[17:27:30] <torbjorn> how persistent are $.data values?
[17:28:01] <torbjorn> I am setting $.data to a $("<tr>") and then inserting it in a table. If I later look up that row, the data is not there
[17:32:42] <Eviltwin> They are linked to the DOM node
[17:33:02] <Eviltwin> There are two ways the data could be lost
[17:33:11] <Eviltwin> 1) You convert the row into HTML and then back into DOM nodes
[17:33:24] <Eviltwin> 2) You use .remove() instead of .detach() to move the element into the table
[17:33:47] <Eviltwin> If you can make a tiny repro in jsFiddle I can help you take a look
[17:42:00] <admintheturtle> hi guys, how can i remove from the the list an item thats already selected ? http://tympanus.net/Development/SimpleDropDownEffects/index.html
[17:50:38] <Eviltwin> admintheturtle: Doesn't look like it's supported.
[17:51:51] <admintheturtle> but can i change somehow the code for that?
[17:53:20] <grafi> oô
[17:54:47] <Eviltwin> admintheturtle: You certainly could
[17:54:56] <admintheturtle> can you help?
[17:55:03] <grafi> admintheturtle  you cant just remove li's from the ul ...
[17:55:03] <admintheturtle> don't even know where to start
[17:55:08] <grafi> *CAN
[17:55:25] <Eviltwin> Worth a shot at least
[17:55:55] <admintheturtle> when you choose an option, that option will get to the select and also to the list, i would want to remove from the list since it's already choosen
[17:56:18] <admintheturtle> my problem is not to get list again
[17:56:24] <grafi> what list oô
[17:56:37] <grafi> all i see is one select on the link you posted
[17:56:49] <admintheturtle> sure, click on it
[17:56:53] <admintheturtle> ans delect an option
[17:56:55] <admintheturtle> and
[17:56:58] <admintheturtle> select
[17:57:17] <admintheturtle> now you get twice the same name
[17:57:32] <admintheturtle> how to get rid of the one in the drop down list
[17:58:39] <grafi> i see
[17:59:18] <grafi> seems like wasted effort to me though, you would be removing selected items, and reinserting them once the user selected something else
[18:00:32] <torbjorn> Eviltwin: I used neither .remove nor .detach, I created the element first, $("<tr>"), added some <td>'s to it, and then $("#idofexisting_table tbody").append( tr );
[18:00:52] <torbjorn> after that I did $("#tableid tbody tr:last").date( "foo", "bar" );
[18:01:23] <torbjorn> that data point was lost later when I did $("#tabldid tbody tr").each( function( i, obj ){ $.data( $(this), "foo" ) } )
[18:01:30] <torbjorn> tried with obj and $(obj) too
[18:02:23] <Eviltwin> torbjorn: Can you put together a small jsFiddle that shows this not working?
[18:03:32] <admintheturtle> it could be useless but this is the user interface good experience
[18:05:01] <grafi> is it?
[18:05:13] <grafi> i dont mind having options i already have selected
[18:06:49] <torbjorn> Eviltwin: ill have to follow up tomorning, its too late, but thanks for the interest, ill catch up later
[18:07:51] <admintheturtle> i won't discuss this with you…. i just want to make it happen, is it doable? how?
[18:08:24] <Eviltwin> It's doable. You need to change the code to modify the DOM to be what you want
[18:08:53] <admintheturtle> wow great answer i knew hat already, if ant working sure it needs changes....
[18:09:08] <admintheturtle> thank you evil for you direct answer
[18:09:42] <Eviltwin> Well you're effectively asking for someone to change a plugin to work the way you want it to work instead of the way it does currently
[18:09:54] <Eviltwin> And at the same time bitching at people who are bringing up reasonable concerns with your changes
[18:09:56] <grafi> which i am currently doing btw :P
[18:10:20] <admintheturtle> evil, have you ever lear ux design?
[18:10:25] <admintheturtle> learn
[18:10:29] <admintheturtle> study?
[18:10:47] <admintheturtle> for you its ok because you are an it guy
[18:10:48] <Eviltwin> Yes, I took a graduate classes in Human Computer Interaction and User Experience Design
[18:11:05] <jphase> ?
[18:11:10] <jphase> Eviltwin is an IT guy?
[18:11:11] <admintheturtle> how can you say that its ok for you !?
[18:11:27] <admintheturtle> you have to design to everybody man
[18:11:34] <admintheturtle> accessebility
[18:11:41] <admintheturtle> easyness ?
[18:11:51] <Eviltwin> If I wanted accessibility, I wouldn't be using this plugin
[18:11:55] <Eviltwin> And so I'm not
[18:11:58] <admintheturtle> if the item isn't doing anything there why should it shoo up?
[18:12:23] <admintheturtle> i need to use that since the selector won't work with images
[18:12:56] <jphase> admintheturtle: if the plugin you're trying to use doesn't suit the customized use-case you need, then don't use that plugin. Make something custom... problem solved?
[18:13:21] <Eviltwin> Ah but here comes the problem
[18:13:27] <Eviltwin> admintheturtle doesn't actually know how to do that
[18:13:44] <admintheturtle> do you know ?
[18:13:50] <jphase> well then, that's an entirely different thing
[18:13:53] <Eviltwin> And rather than taking the opportunity here to try to learn how to do it himself
[18:13:56] <admintheturtle> <select> with images?
[18:14:12] <jphase> admintheturtle: yeah, it's called an unordered list with styles and some jQuery
[18:14:13] <Eviltwin> He's going for the "maybe I can convince someone else to do it for me" approach
[18:14:19] <Eviltwin> Which is great for him in the short term since he doesn't have to do any work
[18:14:35] <Eviltwin> But bad in the long term because it means the next time he wants to tweak a plugin, he still has no idea how to go about it
[18:14:43] <Eviltwin> And will have to come crawling for help again
[18:15:02] <admintheturtle> I'm not asking to people to do it for me, just for a lead
[18:15:19] <Eviltwin> admintheturtle: The source code for the plugin is 212 lines long
[18:15:22] <Eviltwin> That's really not very much
[18:15:36] <Eviltwin> If you're at all familiar with jQuery, you should at least be able to read it and figure out what it's doing where
[18:15:37] <jphase> admintheturtle: If I were you I'd read their API documentation, and if it doesn't allow you to do what you need customize it or write your own
[18:16:07] <admintheturtle> ok guys thank you for your concerns
[18:16:14] * jphase isn't concerned
[18:16:21] <admintheturtle> your are a big help for me
[18:16:26] <admintheturtle> ;)
[18:16:40] <admintheturtle> I'm trying to learn with this plugin
[18:16:44] <admintheturtle> whats the problem?
[18:16:51] <Eviltwin> Have you read the plugin source?
[18:16:57] <admintheturtle> sure i did
[18:17:10] <Eviltwin> Uh huh
[18:17:14] <admintheturtle> i'am i an query expert? no i ain't
[18:18:46] <admintheturtle> i could get some help
[18:19:15] <Eviltwin> Where in the plugin is the code that runs when you click on one of the options?
[18:19:26] <jphase> well customizing a jQuery plugin isn't typically something that's for jQuery beginners. I'd start by finding the event you're looking for... whichever selects an option
[18:19:39] <jphase> bah, what Eviltwin said ^
[18:19:45] * jphase goes back into the corner
[18:20:19] <admintheturtle> _initEvents : function() {
[18:20:22] <admintheturtle> right?
[18:20:47] <Eviltwin> That runs one time to attach the click listener
[18:20:53] <Eviltwin> That is not the code that runs when an option is clicked
[18:20:57] <Eviltwin> But you're in the right area
[18:21:07] <admintheturtle> this.opts.on( 'click.dropdown', function() {
[18:21:19] <Eviltwin> Good
[18:21:30] <Eviltwin> Now inside there, inside the if statement there are 5 lines
[18:21:34] <Eviltwin> Can you tell me what each of them does?
[18:23:22] <admintheturtle> basically grabs all option in var, on click select it for the input and close
[18:23:37] <admintheturtle> something like that
[18:24:22] <admintheturtle> i guess after line 147 ti should remove from the list, no?
[18:25:26] <Eviltwin> opt doesn't refer to all of the options, it refers to the one you clicked on
[18:26:11] <Eviltwin> So yeah, that one should be removed from the list (or somehow hidden)
[18:26:22] <Eviltwin> The tricky part will be putting the option back in the list
[18:26:36] <Eviltwin> If you don't care about the order you can just put it at the top or bottom of the list
[18:26:57] <Eviltwin> But if you care about order, you're going to have to come up with a way of doing that
[18:26:58] <admintheturtle> it must be in order since is alphabetical
[18:27:16] <admintheturtle> i can't hide since the css rotate option
[18:27:26] <admintheturtle> this is nonsense
[18:27:28] <admintheturtle> i know
[18:27:36] <admintheturtle> thats why i asked for hep
[18:27:44] <Eviltwin> This function may come in handy for helping you remember the position in the list: http://api.jquery.com/index/
[18:28:14] <Eviltwin> Since this plugin looks like it's using jQuery's .data() function to store information
[18:28:24] <Eviltwin> You're going to want to use this to take it out of the list: http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[18:28:28] <Eviltwin> Since it preserves the data
[18:28:43] <admintheturtle> hummm
[18:29:07] <Eviltwin> So you're going to want to store another variable that remembers the list item you removed
[18:29:19] <Eviltwin> And a varaible that remembers where it was in the list
[18:29:21] <admintheturtle> sure when i click again
[18:30:22] <admintheturtle> ok thank you for you patience
[18:30:38] <Eviltwin> I suggest you take the body of this plugin
[18:30:48] <Eviltwin> And dump it in the JavaScript pane at jsFiddle.net
[18:30:57] <Eviltwin> As well as the very basic code to make a list and show it (like the demo you linked)
[18:31:10] <Eviltwin> Then you can work on it there, save it, and come ask questions with that link
[18:31:14] <admintheturtle> I'm using that already
[18:34:14] <grafi> hm cool
[18:34:28] <grafi> now it leaves a whole in the list where the selected option was
[18:34:29] <grafi> :D
[18:34:33] <grafi> fancy
[18:34:42] <Eviltwin> Heh, if that's what you want
[18:35:02] <grafi> it just happened
[18:35:04] <grafi> xD
[18:35:33] <admintheturtle> thats because the rotation
[18:35:55] <Eviltwin> You may need to retrigger the _positionOpts() function after you add / remove items
[18:36:20] <grafi> something like that
[18:36:37] <admintheturtle> grafi are you doing in jsfiddle?
[18:36:39] <grafi> isnt it weird though
[18:36:48] <grafi> that they position the stuff with pos: absolute
[18:36:49] <grafi> oô
[18:36:56] <grafi> seems weird to me
[18:37:13] <admintheturtle> remove that from the css
[18:37:14] <Eviltwin> Yeah, this doesn't look like an awesomely-written plugin
[18:37:16] <admintheturtle> the main selector
[18:37:21] <admintheturtle> it will work
[18:41:30] <grafi> whatll work?
[18:42:36] <admintheturtle> forget
[18:42:39] <admintheturtle> thats css
[18:52:41] <Albert> Hi there, need help with simple problem
[18:53:12] <pamere> TypeError: webcam.capture is not a function thrown occasionally ...http://pastebin.com/hwVdfUw8
[18:53:33] <Albert> I'd like to set every div with the class "emision" to get it's width set to whatever it's data-duration attribute specifies
[18:53:49] <Albert> This is what I've come up with, but it doesn't work
[18:53:50] <Albert> $('.emision').css('width' , $(this).data("duration") + 'px');
[18:54:03] <pixelpimp> try .attr('data-duration')
[18:54:14] <raj> if I provide a 'source' for autocomplete which is an associative array object, how can I only use a particular key in the object for populating the autocomplete box?
[18:54:42] <Albert> pixelpimp that's equivalent to .data('duration') in the last versions isn't it?
[18:54:43] <Eviltwin> Albert: $('.emision').each(function () { $(this).css('width', $(this).data('duration')); });
[18:54:57] <grafi> crazy plugin oô
[18:55:04] <raj> wow, Eviltwin, nice to see you
[18:55:10] <pixelpimp> oh yeah, each one will have a different data
[18:55:13] <raj> haven't seen you around in quite a while!
[18:56:06] <pamere> TypeError: webcam.capture is not a function thrown occasionally ...http://pastebin.com/hwVdfUw8
[18:56:50] <Albert> Eviltwin this one did it, thanks a lot. May I ask why mine wasn't working at all? It makes sense now that I should have used .each to grab each different duration, but it wasn't setting the width to any value at all
[18:58:44] <Eviltwin> Albert: In jQuery, "this" only has a logical value inside of a callback function
[18:58:44] <admintheturtle> grafi: having problems?
[18:59:05] <Eviltwin> So $(...).something(function() { /* here */ })
[18:59:32] <Albert> oh, I see, thanks a lot, I had been trying to get this right for quite some time :)

[19:38:07] <admintheturtle> thought that mean something
[19:38:08] <grafi> currently the selected option disappears
[19:38:14] <admintheturtle> let me see
[19:38:16] <ra1n> is it easy to prefetch some images in an unordred list? a (gallery)
[19:39:02] <admintheturtle> images should be the problem
[19:39:07] <admintheturtle> shouldnt
[19:40:36] <ra1n> all the examples i've looked at seem a bit long winded just for a few images
[19:41:18] <admintheturtle> thats the class if you want it but its not crucial
[19:41:28] <admintheturtle> it must be something else
[19:43:33] <grafi> admintheturtle http://jsfiddle.net/3Ptuc/3/ thats the not so broken version, you see first time opening that there are two 1's but after that the selected item is removed from the list / added back if you select another item

[20:55:29] <quang> instead of get

[20:58:47] <k_sze[work]> Not exactly a jQuery question, but I figure enough people in this room use ParsleyJS for form validation as well: how can I temporarily prevent parsley from performing further validation without wiping the error messages?
[21:00:05] <pixelpimp> not sure you can avoid using ajax here.
[22:39:25] <sasmit87> Hi all
[22:39:37] <sasmit87> I am using jquery validator
[22:40:35] <sasmit87> http://paste.ofcode.org/nCGm8K97icySzzTVP5BEuY  here onchange of radio button I want to add validator error label based on some condition
[22:50:23] <garbagecollectio> $.ajaxSettings.xhr won't fire on ajax
[22:50:28] <garbagecollectio> but the ajax requests are being made
[22:50:49] <garbagecollectio> how is that possible
[22:53:56] <sasmit87> I am using jquery validator
[22:54:03] <sasmit87> http://paste.ofcode.org/nCGm8K97icySzzTVP5BEuY here onchange of radio button I want to add validator error label based on some condition
[23:36:15] <nardev> is this maybe too much for jquery? it diesn't want to select, returns undefined .box:visible > input[name^="answer"]:radio:checked
[23:36:36] <nardev> ofcourse it's like this $('.box:visible > input[name^="answer"]:radio:checked').val()
[23:37:16] <Cork> nardev: and most of the boxes(.bix) are display: none; ?
[23:37:21] <Cork> *.box
[23:37:30] <Cork> cause that is what :visible checks
[23:38:05] <nardev> Cork, i have thise .box divs and in each div i have set of radio boxed
[23:38:31] <nardev> so i want to check what is selected only in those that are visible
[23:38:35] <nardev> at the moment
[23:38:42] <nardev> actually it's always only one
[23:38:46] <Cork> define "visible"
[23:39:03] <nardev> visible => css is nit display: none
[23:39:12] <nardev> *not
[23:39:24] <Cork> then that selector should work
[23:39:31] <nardev> :(
[23:39:34] <Cork> you will only get the value of the first radio element though
[23:39:55] <nardev> Cork, it's ok, only one radio can be selected...
[23:39:57] <Cork> nardev: if you need more help create a fiddle
[23:40:09] <nardev> Cork, ok
[23:52:11] <nardev> Cork, ITS STRANGE IN FIDDLE IT WORKS BUT.. http://jsfiddle.net/nardev/TZsma/2/
[23:52:21] <nardev> IT SEEMS THAT I HAVE SOME COLLISION HERE
[23:52:30] <Cork> don't scream
[23:52:56] <nardev> Cork, sorry
[23:53:00] <nardev> it was by mistake
[23:53:04] <nardev> i'm really sorry
[23:54:09] <Cork> np, it happens
[23:54:12] <nardev> Cork, is it possible that .class > bust be the nearest parent?
[23:54:26] <Cork> sorry?
[23:54:29] <nardev> because i have few more nested divs before it reaches
[23:54:36] <nardev> radio buttons
[23:54:46] <nardev> *must
[23:54:52] <Cork> nearest to what?
[23:55:50] <nardev> lokk i have <div class="box"> <div class="some_segment"> <input type="radio"..... and i want to fetch it by .box:visible > radio...
[23:56:12] <nardev> Corey,  does > mean only the nearest child?
[23:56:30] <Cork> direct decedent
[23:57:13] <Cork> .box:visible will give you all .box elements that isn't display:none or visibility: hidden
[23:57:22] <Cork> the input selector will select all inputs on that one
[23:57:36] <Cork> then it will grab the attribute name and regex match it to the string
[23:57:50] <Cork> and then go through that list and only keep radio buttons
[23:57:55] <nardev> Cork, so no metter how deep <input.. is nested under <div class="box"...
[23:57:56] <Cork> and then loop that and check this.checked
[23:58:01] <Cork> no
[23:58:05] <Cork> only direct decentent
[23:58:11] <nardev> Cork, OK
[23:58:23] <Cork> but direct decentent of all the .box
[23:58:27] <Cork> *es
[23:58:44] <Cork> anyway and then it will grab the first input from that list of checked elements
[23:58:52] <Cork> and grab it's "value" value
[23:58:59] <nardev> Cork, ok
[23:59:05] <nardev> thank you
[23:59:11] <Cork> so it leaves quite a list of things that can go wrong
[23:59:27] <nardev> Cork, something like this is stupid? .box:visible > .question > .answer >
[23:59:49] <Cork> it's better then all the :selectors you have now
