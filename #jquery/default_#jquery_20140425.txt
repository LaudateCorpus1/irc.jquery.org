[00:42:22] <jcoder1> Good Morning :)
[00:44:28] <seich> jcoder1: Morning ;)
[00:44:40] <jcoder1> Does unobtrusive validation have different validation properties depending on the data-val-foo type ?
[00:44:57] <jcoder1> s/properties/priorities/
[00:45:58] <jcoder1> Just wondering because a form I have does not validate data-val-required unless I click twice on submit button :(
[00:46:38] <jcoder1> However data-val-regex always validates on the first click
[00:51:36] <mepl> I have an ajax login, is it safe to push the password with ajax to php?
[00:55:55] <mepl> dead channel is dead
[00:58:24] <Jattenalle> mepl, that depends on your definition of "safe"
[00:58:26] <Cork> mepl: it is as safe as sending it with normal http
[00:58:45] <Cork> meaning securing the connection is important for both
[00:58:59] <Jattenalle> if you're already handling the password in JS, and you hate SSL, you should at least hash it before you send it
[00:59:24] <Cork> Jattenalle: hashing it before you send it won't really help
[00:59:45] <Jattenalle> hash -> server side, take hash, add in salt, compare
[00:59:55] <Jattenalle> but yeah, it wont be more "secure"
[01:00:06] <Jattenalle> it'll just be less "send plaintext passwords"
[01:00:10] <Cork> Jattenalle: hashing it before you send it just makes the hash the password instead of the password
[01:00:14] <Jattenalle> ^^
[01:00:15] <Cork> so it adds nothing to security
[01:00:21] <Jattenalle> aye
[01:00:56] <j0rd_> anyone know how to trigger your jquery click event last after all rest of cliick events are triggered?
[01:01:03] <mepl> I do not handle any password, it's the user submitting her/him's password in a html form
[01:01:11] <mepl> then it is just sent to php for handling with js
[01:01:28] <Cork> sent to php for handling WITH JS?!?
[01:01:48] <mepl> ajax is js isnt it?
[01:02:01] <Cork> then it is sent to php through js
[01:02:07] <Cork> not for handling :)
[01:02:29] <Cork> form > php > js doesn't make sense
[01:02:36] <Cork> form > js > ajax > php does
[01:03:19] <mepl> ajax > form > php > js is the way
[01:03:29] <Cork> so you backend run js?
[01:03:33] <Jattenalle> huh? you run JS on your server?
[01:03:42] <mepl> it was a bad joke, but sure I would like to try out node
[01:04:19] <Cork> mepl: anyway to answer your question
[01:04:36] <Cork> ajax is just as secure as any other form of form submission
[01:05:20] <Cork> mepl: if you care about securing it csp + ssl is important
[01:05:31] <Cork> also you want to not send the data through GET
[01:06:18] <Jattenalle> hah, i love sites that still do that.. go to copy the url, and it has freakin ?name=Username&password=PlainTextWtf
[01:06:28] <Jattenalle> such security, much safety.
[01:06:44] <Cork> Jattenalle: ya
[01:07:08] <Jattenalle> or even better, sites that blindly trust the cookies
[01:07:15] <Jattenalle> change the ID in the cookie, become someone else!
[01:07:33] <Cork> Jattenalle: that means most sites
[01:08:04] <Cork> Jattenalle: and there isn't really much they can do about that except logging what geip you normally connect from
[01:08:10] <Jattenalle> most sites at least has a hash based on the id+name, so you cant just change the ID
[01:08:27] <Cork> Jattenalle: no
[01:08:29] <Jattenalle> im talking about those amazing sites that only have a single cookie, with something like "userid=1882"
[01:08:37] <Jattenalle> change it to 1883 and you become Bob instead of Adam
[01:08:38] <Cork> session id is by far the most common solution
[01:08:45] <Jattenalle> no no, not session id
[01:08:59] <Jattenalle> just plain integer user id from the database crap
[01:09:02] <Cork> session id is the number you talk about
[01:09:20] <Jattenalle> no, im talking about literally userid=1882
[01:09:28] <Jattenalle> and in the database, at index 1882, you'd have the user
[01:09:32] <Cork> can't say i've ever seen though
[01:09:34] <Jattenalle> and it blindly trust that integer
[01:09:38] <Jattenalle> been a while since i saw it
[01:09:42] <abhvym> hi
[01:09:51] <Jattenalle> was pretty common back in early 2000's
[01:09:56] <Cork> Jattenalle: we had a run in with doing that in old rails
[01:10:09] <abhvym> $( "#nav" ).children().hide(); hides children of all "sub" ul except the last one. how do i hide the last one too?
[01:10:17] <Cork> Jattenalle: they announced "store the data in the cookie session it is hashed and secure!
[01:10:32] <Cork> Jattenalle: when we lated checked hashed == base64 !?!
[01:10:39] <Jattenalle> hahaha
[01:10:44] <obert> hello,i got a structure like <content><article><h1>, i would to append <foo> after <h1>, trying $('#content article h1').append('<foo>'); but the result is <h1> <foo></h1> can you help me?
[01:10:52] <Jattenalle> it's such a nice hash though, isnt it! i mean you can just get back the original text :D
[01:10:52] <Cork> we quite quickly moved to memcaceh after that :)
[01:10:58] <Cork> i had to work night to get it done XD
[01:11:20] <Cork> Jattenalle: opps sorry they said they cryptated it
[01:11:31] <Jattenalle> that's not better though :P
[01:11:31] <Cork> Jattenalle: the idea was that you didn't have to store anything server side
[01:11:44] <Cork> Jattenalle: ya, that escaped not cryptated...
[01:12:04] <Jattenalle> reminds me of the good 'ol days
[01:12:11] <Jattenalle> when i wrote "encryptions" in qbasic
[01:12:18] <Jattenalle> simple shift rotations :D
[01:12:19] <Cork> i still remember the sinking feeling when i poked at it and got the plain ruby hash back after a base64decode...
[01:12:21] <Jattenalle> so secure!
[01:12:28] <Cork> heh
[01:12:29] <Cork> ya
[01:12:59] <abhvym> how can i hide children <ul> and show its li on click ?
[01:13:03] <Cork> obert: $('#content article h1').after()
[01:13:17] <obert> what after() does?
[01:13:39] <Cork> api.jquery.com/after
[01:13:43] <obert> is it like append?
[01:13:47] <Cork> kidna
[01:13:52] <obert> bah it works
[01:13:53] <Cork> *kinda
[01:13:57] <abhvym> kind of
[01:13:59] <abhvym> *
[01:14:38] <obert> and when should i use .append/prepend then?
[01:14:40] <obert> bah
[01:14:50] <Cork> abhvym: $('#top ul').hide();$('#top').on('click', 'li', function() { $(this).children('ul').show(); });
[01:15:06] <Cork> obert: when you want to add it inside h1
[01:15:22] <Cork> you append/prepend TO the element
[01:15:29] <Cork> not to the parent of the element
[01:15:36] <obert> mhm
[01:15:50] <obert> thanks for the explanation then
[01:19:40] <abhvym> Cork, showinhg not working
[01:19:51] <obert> i was getting the wrong approach ;)
[01:20:19] <Cork> abhvym: that should work, unless you have something around your child uls
[01:21:39] <abhvym> Cork, https://gist.github.com/abhi-navale/11281905
[01:22:19] <Cork> abhvym: <ul id="nav">{{ loop(item.children) }}</ul> <-- this isn't valid
[01:22:27] <Cork> you will have duplicate ids
[01:23:00] <Cork> but ya this should work $('#prnt ul').hide(); $('#prnt').on('click', 'li', function() { $(this).children('ul').show(); });
[01:23:03] <abhvym> Cork, ok. python flask needs to print the contens of a folder recursively. hence the loop. how can i solve it?
[01:23:56] <abhvym> Cork, yay. this is what i wanted. its working. thanks!
[01:26:33] <Cork> abhvym: use a class instead of an id
[01:26:48] <Cork> ids may not exist on more then one element
[01:27:34] <abhvym> yes.
[02:04:14] <LeonardDa> Hi guys. How can I load an external page like google into a div?
[02:06:04] <erming> LeonardDa, you could get the HTML via jQuery.ajax(), but if you really want THE Google inside your page, you're looking for an <iframe>
[02:06:43] <LeonardDa> erming: And what if I want to load my own local page?
[02:08:12] <erming> LeonardDa: well, you could build something yourself, with a form and input that then sends you to google.com/?search=something
[02:08:22] <erming> (that ?search=... was just made up by me just now)
[02:09:51] <erming> but basically, copy pasting doesn't really work that great when copying sites.. and this is effectively what you could do with .ajax()
[02:10:15] <erming> <iframe> however, is for embedding external sites inside your own
[02:11:13] <erming> just found out that you can't put Google in iframes, so don't :> (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8700636/how-to-show-google-com-in-an-iframe)
[02:12:56] <rtpg> are $($(elt)) and $(elt) the same more or less?
[02:15:04] <erming> rtpg yeah
[02:15:06] <Cork> rtpg: yes
[02:15:42] <Cork> the former is wasting a bit of time calling $() twice, but it shouldn't matter normally
[02:16:44] <erming> another use case might be: $(something).add($(other))
[03:19:33] <EshaM> Hi, I am working oh HTML5 video elements, and the js 'ended' event is not triggering
[03:50:51] <n-a-n> hi all
[04:40:23] <farid> Hi.. I need some expert advice
[04:42:10] <farid> I have a div which is hidden overflow... and it containts a huge list of <li>.... somehow i want to bring the focus to a specific li or lets say bring it op where it can be seen..... like we have hyperlinks with in a page and whn you click that bit comes on top
[04:43:49] <xec> does the overflow hidden have anything to do with it?
[04:44:27] <msafi> How can I get the height of an event target?
[04:45:07] <xec> farid: if you want a link to scroll to an element, just do <a href="#myLi">link</a> and it will scroll to <li id="myLi">
[04:45:31] <farid> @xec as the list it too long.. that is hwy i have over flow hiddne on the div and i have put a specifit hight on the div
[04:45:51] <farid> so div remains same height and it scrolls if there is a huge list
[04:46:29] <rigneo> hello, i want to change the text inside the first li of a list, i am doing this but its not happening ? jQuery('.chosen-results li').first().text('Select a Province');
[04:47:48] <farid> that is the sort of thing i wan trying to do with jquery.. actually that div refresh itself every 10 seconds :0 using a bit go ajax
[04:47:50] <xec> farid: that should work. http://jsfiddle.net/FY93A/
[04:48:32] <xec> farid: if you want to scroll programatically, have a look at http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[04:49:13] <farid> ok let me check
[04:49:55] <farid> that pice of code is list of messages ... its like a inbox for internal messages and it refreshes every 10 sec.. just to give you an idea of what i am dealing with :0
[04:53:43] <rigneo>  hello, i want to change the text inside the first li of a list, i am doing this but its not happening ? jQuery('.chosen-results li').first().text('Select a Province');
[04:56:26] <seutje> rigneo: considering it's chosen, I'm guessing that this line is being executed before the .chosen-results exist
[04:57:56] <rigneo> i used window.load
[04:58:10] <seutje> rigneo: it would probably be more interesting to change the actual option text in the source
[04:58:55] <seutje> rigneo: well, if these are only build upon opening the select list, window.load won't do you much good
[04:58:56] <rigneo> yeah but its a plugin and cannot edit core files
[04:59:09] <rigneo> its not a select lis
[04:59:11] <rigneo> list
[04:59:16] <rigneo> its ul li
[04:59:23] <seutje> that's what chosen makes of it
[04:59:53] <seutje> it's essentially a satellite for the select list, copying over it's options on init
[05:01:19] <seutje> also, straight from the docs:  $(".chosen-select").chosen({no_results_text: "Oops, nothing found!"});
[05:01:52] <rigneo> hm
[05:01:55] <seutje> lol, I didn't copy that, silly clipboar
[05:02:17] <seutje> <select data-placeholder="Choose a country..." style="width:350px;" multiple class="chosen-select">
[05:02:19] <seutje> there we go
[05:03:25] <seutje> pretty stupid u can't just have it use the first option's text o.O
[05:13:24] <brunoais> seutje, the placeholder attribute does not lave the "data-" before it...
[05:15:40] <seutje> brunoais: take it up with the maintainers of the documenation: http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/#default-text-support
[05:16:57] <brunoais> seutje, why that?
[05:16:59] <seutje> oh man, 215 open issues... now I remember why I avoid this like the plague
[05:17:18] <brunoais> why not trust the browser to make the right placeholder for the user?
[05:17:20] <seutje> brunoais: cause ur saying the documentation is wrong
[05:17:26] <seutje> ur not making any sense now
[05:17:42] <brunoais> I'm not here for long
[05:17:45] <seutje> the browser doesn't map a placeholder over to a unordered list
[05:17:50] <brunoais> I may have missed part of the talk
[05:18:02] <brunoais> sorry about that
[05:18:18] <brunoais> (Hum... I most probably really did miss)
[05:19:06] <seutje> rigneo wanted to change the first item in a Chosen select list
[05:19:16] <seutje> rigneo: hello, i want to change the text inside the first li of a list, i am doing this but its not happening ? jQuery('.chosen-results li').first().text('Select a Province');
[05:19:40] <seutje> well, he didn't mention he was using chosen, kinda had to guess that bit
[05:48:16] <MikeD_> have you ever seen the $.each() iterator be broken in a way that it never advances to the next element?
[05:50:12] <xec> MikeD_: nope. but if you are adding items to whatever it is you're iterating through it might misbehave?
[05:50:22] <xec> not sure though
[05:51:40] <MikeD_> it's definitely weird - i'm used to debugging problems caused by my own typos or logic breakdown, but this one is new to me.
[05:52:19] <xec> have you tried explaining the code flow to a rubber duck?
[05:52:42] <MikeD_> haha, i was just talking to someone about rubber ducking this week
[05:52:55] <xec> :D
[05:53:35] <xec> you might not want to do that if you're in an open office space. people already find developers pretty odd
[05:54:17] <MikeD_> I asked the other members of my team a OO design question... one said "that's too esoteric for me" and the other just kept smirking as if I'd told a funny joke.
[05:54:40] <decx> that's because OO looks liek boobs
[05:55:08] <MikeD_> well, that confirms both your favorite 'objects' and your 'orientation'  :)
[05:55:17] <decx> heyoo
[05:55:17] <xec> lol
[05:56:00] <decx> Ownix you there?
[05:56:01] * xec holds up a 10-point sign
[05:56:56] <Ownix> decx: driving to work ATM
[05:57:21] <decx> well i played around with the idea of a markup based game, and it's a mess
[05:57:29] <decx> you can check it later
[05:58:19] <MikeD_> are you proving that markup based games are always going to be a mess?
[05:59:11] <decx> with my abilities at least
[06:00:50] <MikeD_> perhaps "mess" is a broad categorization
[06:03:52] <decx> nope, saving coordinates separate from dom entities to not have to get css() first, and then synchronizing that coordinate array with a jquery collection is definitely a mess :>
[06:04:53] <MikeD_> sounds like an MVC-inspired train wreck
[06:13:06] <Ownix> decx: im here now
[06:13:11] <Ownix> Heres my latest iteration http://jsfiddle.net/BZxjC/12/
[06:15:31] <decx> Ownix http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Sg77m/
[06:16:58] <MikeD_> definitely needs some explosions :)
[06:17:12] <decx> the trick is to change velocity on keypress and not position directly, then slow down the velocity with global friction
[06:17:56] <Ownix> decx: holy... you made me feel bad about my game and code lol
[06:18:24] <decx> yeah i have an idea for that MikeD_ when enemy.life is < 10 start an animation and in its callback remove the element
[06:18:43] <decx> Ownix don't, when i first tried something like that i made the same things you did
[06:19:39] <decx> i annotated the code as best as i can so maybe you can get something from it ^^
[06:22:30] <MikeD_> i'm impressed that you have collision detection working at all :)
[06:23:11] <MikeD_> I wanted to implement collision-detection in Alice (for a programming class) but decided I didn't have enough hours in the day to do all that 3D math :)
[06:24:20] <Ownix> decx:I have some assignments but its definitely bookmarked
[06:24:27] <decx> no 3d involved for rectangles if (a.x > b.x && a.x < b.x + b.size && a.y > b.y && a.y < b.y + b.size)
[06:25:36] <decx> the math only really comes into play when you do anything but rectangles ;)
[06:25:52] <MikeD_> yeah, so 2d CD is easier than 3d (Alice is a 3d object programming environment)
[06:26:14] <decx> yeah that add a whole new dimension (heyooo)
[06:26:30] <BillCriswell> I need to learn me some math.
[06:27:13] <MikeD_> BillCriswell: ikr, years of school... and we still don't know the really cool maths
[06:28:12] <decx> i felt like a math genius when i remembered pythagoras to calculate the distance between two coordinates on a 2d plane
[06:28:24] <decx> dat 4th grad math
[06:28:33] <decx> grade*
[06:28:34] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Yeah, I think I overcomplicated math during high school. I pick things up a lot quicker now honestly.
[06:28:44] <BillCriswell> My brain is like working in reverse.
[06:29:04] <jrajav> 'trigger' is supposed to be fully synchronous, correct? By which I mean, if you've attached event handlers to an element and you trigger that event, those handlers will run before the trigger returns?
[06:29:20] <decx> yes
[06:29:26] <decx> maybe
[06:29:30] <decx> i don't know
[06:30:01] <BillCriswell> I imagine the trigger happening instantaneously.
[06:30:05] <BillCriswell> Did I spell that right?
[06:30:11] <BillCriswell> Holy shit I did.
[06:30:24] <decx> notbad_obama
[06:31:06] <BillCriswell> http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/42168/difference-between-instantly-and-instantaneously interesting.
[06:31:42] <BillCriswell> I therefore replace "instantaneously" with "instantly".
[06:31:55] <Jattenalle> noo
[06:32:05] <Jattenalle> there's delay, you were right the first time
[06:32:13] <Jattenalle> instantaneously is the way to go
[06:32:20] <Jattenalle> it's a pain to type though
[06:32:28] <decx> totally butchered it there
[06:32:41] <BillCriswell> instantanusly
[06:32:50] <Jattenalle> instanow.
[06:32:58] <jrajav> Wait what there's delay?
[06:33:14] <Jattenalle> jrajav, no no.. i'm being anal
[06:33:15] <BillCriswell> The trigger happens before the next operation.
[06:33:16] <decx> instantriciatakanawa
[06:33:20] <Jattenalle> there's a delay, as in it takes time to execute
[06:33:21] <BillCriswell> I think is how I want to say that.
[06:33:24] <BillCriswell> I am not a word man, though.
[06:33:34] <Jattenalle> it's instant for your intents and purposes though jrajav ^^
[06:33:37] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: So is anything "instant"?
[06:33:51] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, indeed, hence why i called myself anal ;)
[06:33:54] <BillCriswell> I'm getting too deep.
[06:34:06] <BillCriswell> Haha
[06:36:13] <BillCriswell> I don't think the word instant should exist now.
[06:36:29] <BillCriswell> I arrived at that thought instantaneously.
[06:36:46] <Jattenalle> did you though? or do you just think you did and it was actually instant all along!
[06:37:20] <jrajav> Does that include ALL event handlers that may have been affected?
[06:37:21] <BillCriswell> My braaiiinnn.
[06:37:33] <jrajav> For instance, if I trigger 'focus' on one element
[06:37:51] <jrajav> Can I trust that 'blur' on a different, previously focused element was also called before trigger returns?
[06:37:51] <BillCriswell> and it triggers shit on another element?
[06:38:06] <BillCriswell> Hmm... I'd like to think it does.
[06:38:20] <BillCriswell> I wasn't ready these types of questions. It's Friday.
[06:38:34] <jrajav> It's Friday MORNING, some of us are working :P
[06:38:52] <BillCriswell> It's Friday morning here as wellhaha
[06:39:43] <Jattenalle> jrajav, yes, it "should".. but any animation will not have completed, obviously
[06:39:47] <Jattenalle> animation/transition
[06:40:02] <funkt> Hi there what do i need to put in my url to view a jsfiddle on fullscreen?
[06:40:08] <jrajav> That's not what I'm worried about. We seem to be getting intermittent test failures and this is the only thing I can trace it to
[06:40:10] <Jattenalle> the blur event happens before the focus event (or so a quick spec skim-read told me)
[06:40:49] <Jattenalle> the event order is: blur -> focus
[06:40:55] <Jattenalle> so blur is called before focus
[06:41:08] <Jattenalle> so say the allmighty specs.. but who knows what each browser is actually doing..
[06:41:58] <funkt> Does anyone know how you view a jsfiddle in full screen?
[06:42:12] <funkt> I know I have to modify the url but I cannot remember
[06:42:27] <BillCriswell> jrajav: http://jsbin.com/mokeleda/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:42:44] <BillCriswell> Seems the events happen first according to console... but I don't trust that thing sometimes.
[06:44:39] <abishek> how to set the background color of a div using jquery? $(selector).css('background-color','#FFFFFF') correct?
[06:44:49] <BillCriswell> abishek: You bet.
[06:45:13] <Cork> abishek: yes
[06:45:25] <Cork> oh late
[06:45:31] <decx> i know if everyone just tested and googled this channel would be dead. but how hard would it be to test that once you've already written it out?
[06:45:55] <Cork> :)
[06:46:28] <Cork> decx: actually the channel wouldn't be dead
[06:46:38] <Cork> cause some questions you can't answer until you know the answer
[06:46:56] <Cork> (meaning searching won't help you)
[06:46:59] <decx> there would still be riveting discussions about the correct use of instantaneously
[06:48:46] <Justice> Im playing with jquery mobile, thing is that after loading a page with an ajax request using enhancewithin() method. If that page contains a div-role=page then it wont get rendered by JQM.
[06:49:00] <Justice> is there something i can do about it? or am I missing something?=
[06:49:38] <BillCriswell> decx: You're God damn right.
[06:50:50] <abishek> BillCriswell, Cork, tried it and it doesn't seem to work. can you tell me what could be the issue. http://jsbin.com/tetecupu/1/edit
[06:52:36] <BillCriswell> abishek: You're setting the background color to color_selector
[06:53:02] <BillCriswell> You're also double wrapping color_selector when you append, which isn't needed.
[06:53:17] <abishek> ok, thnx
[06:53:37] <ace_me> I have a map on the page and a linonto which I click and at on($.modal.OPEN, function(event, modal) { I would like to get the existing map on the page and display it in modal
[06:53:44] <BillCriswell> abishek: http://jsbin.com/tetecupu/2/edit?html,js,output
[06:53:48] <abishek> how could I miss such a silly mistake :(
[06:54:08] <BillCriswell> Happens to absolutely everyone.
[06:54:22] <BillCriswell> If someone claims otherwise they're a liar haha
[06:54:31] <TViernion> So, refreshing a single div on a page that requires some php .. that going to be jquery or ajax?
[06:54:51] <TViernion> plus the div has php variables in it.
[06:55:12] <BillCriswell> TViernion: That sounds wrong.
[06:55:24] <Cork> abishek: http://jsbin.com/tetecupu/4/edit
[06:55:43] <Cork> abishek: well it was easy enough to miss :)
[06:55:51] <Cork> took me a while to see it too
[06:56:01] <abishek> thnx BillCriswell, Cork
[06:56:10] <BillCriswell> TViernion: It would be ajax. It's up to you if you want to use jQuery to do it or not... I recommend you do though.
[06:56:32] <BillCriswell> TViernion: What's happening with the PHP has nothing to do with the jQuery. The jQuery just pulls in what PHP puts out.
[06:56:39] <TViernion> billcriswell, im open to suggestions.  I'm absolutly sick of the ENTIRE page refreshing.
[06:56:45] <decx> don't append to the document in a forloop abishek collect and serve once
[06:56:53] <Cork> true
[06:57:14] <abishek> what do you mean by collect and serve?
[06:58:39] <decx> you save your appends to a document fragment or an array inside your forloop, and after that forloop append it all once
[06:59:04] <decx> doesn't really matter in this example but it's good practise to cut down on repaints
[06:59:34] <decx> practice
[06:59:47] <abishek> to retrieve it from the loop and append to the document I will have to still use another forloop right?
[07:00:13] <abishek> can i $(ul).append(array) ?
[07:00:35] <decx> create a var to hold the stuff that happens in your for loop before the loop, after the loop you can then append that var
[07:00:59] <abishek> decx, do you mean as html?
[07:01:07] <abishek> decx, can you give an example?
[07:01:22] <BillCriswell> abishek: array.join('') sure, but not just an array I don't htink.
[07:01:49] <decx> i would but i'm afk for a while
[07:01:59] <decx> i'm sure somebody can give you a hint :>
[07:02:46] <niko> hello, how i can get the content of a <style id="less:less-setup" type="text/css"> with jQuery ?
[07:02:54] <TViernion> Billcriswell, is it possible to load the current page but ONLY render "#div1"?
[07:03:19] <BillCriswell> #div1 on the current page? So you want two of the same elments on the current page?
[07:04:27] <BillCriswell> abishek: He's basically suggesting adding all the lis at once instead of at a time.
[07:05:40] <abishek> BillCriswell, assume I add all the objects to an array, how do I then append to the UL? wouldn't I need another forloop?
[07:06:10] <BillCriswell> abishek: No, just .append( someArray.join('') );
[07:06:18] <abishek> oh ok
[07:06:19] <BillCriswell> Like if you were working with strings this could work: http://jsbin.com/sipajiqe/1/edit
[07:06:38] <StanAccy> Im doing some debugging of my jquery selectors in Chrome.  Ive got an array bveing returned (selected values of select elements).  Is there a quick quick way to print out the values of the array, one value per line (currently everything is appended on a single line without spaces)
[07:07:21] <StanAccy> Im assuming this: $('#inbox tr td:nth-child(7) div select option:selected').text();   returns a jquery object ?
[07:07:38] <Hooloovoo> StanAccy: Nope, it returns a string.
[07:08:05] <StanAccy> Hooloovoo: oh, the .text() is working on the selected objects?
[07:08:10] <BillCriswell> abishek: http://jsbin.com/forilozo/1/edit here is it with jquery dom ways.
[07:08:16] <Hooloovoo> StanAccy: Welcome to jquery :)
[07:08:56] <StanAccy> Hooloovoo: Ok, so I drop the .text(), and I still have the selected elements.  Can I put them in to \n delimted String with some neat jquuery method?
[07:09:25] <Hooloovoo> StanAccy: You can save the elements to a variable first and then do .text() on that.
[07:09:35] <StanAccy> Im trying to do this on a single line within the Chrome console :-)
[07:09:45] <StanAccy> just for debugging purposes
[07:10:02] <StanAccy> Im actually debugging a Datatables.net Dom element sort
[07:10:11] <Hooloovoo> You want the text content of n number of elements?
[07:10:24] <StanAccy> yeh, printed in the Chrome inspector console, one element per line
[07:10:34] <Hooloovoo> ok, do this
[07:10:44] <StanAccy> I was wondering if there was a .prettyPrint( '\n' ); kinda function
[07:10:51] <Hooloovoo> $("selector").each(function() { console.log($(this).html()) });
[07:11:09] <StanAccy> close enough - thanks!
[07:11:14] <Hooloovoo> No problemo!
[07:11:19] <Hooloovoo> However
[07:11:29] <Hooloovoo> You can comma separate different things with console.log()
[07:11:40] <Hooloovoo> like console.log("asd", "qwe", 1, test)
[07:11:49] <Hooloovoo> That's not very useful there tho.
[07:12:49] <StanAccy> ok that works a treat.
[07:37:18] <TViernion> BillCriswell : here is the "structure" of the page that I am needing to refresh divs on
[07:39:42] <TViernion> http://fpaste.org/96946/84349391/
[07:39:54] <TViernion> sorry about that billcriswell ^-- link
[07:40:35] <StanAccy> is there an easy way to copy the javascript exception stack from Chrome inspector window? (so that I can paste the contents somewhere)
[07:43:05] <BillCriswell> TViernion: Can't use the same id twice, an id also can't start with a number.
[07:43:28] <TViernion> It was an illistration :)
[07:43:48] <TViernion> http://fpaste.org/96956/84370231/
[07:44:07] <TViernion> the first time i pasted it.. it refused my post as it said you cannot submit more than once every 5 seconds
[07:45:46] <decx> you can $('#container').load('stuff.php #one') to fill #container with the contents from #one, but it's more advisable to serve these page fragments separately from your php endpoint
[07:46:22] <decx> so you can get stuff.php?fragment=one which is cleaner
[07:46:52] <pro> hi all, i have code im trying to write and its working but i think its ugly, is there a better way to do this? http://pastebin.com/NtyqQG8n
[07:47:52] <decx> use classes for all your elements instead
[07:48:27] <pro> decx but they 6 different things, so how will it know which one to change?
[07:48:40] <pro> im new to jquery/js
[07:48:49] <pro> so i dont know too much
[07:48:54] <brunoais> pro, yeah, sure
[07:49:02] <brunoais> but the best way depends on the HTML tructure
[07:49:05] <brunoais> *structure
[07:49:05] <decx> i'll write an example
[07:49:28] <pro> i basically have 6 images and when you move over the images it must change the color of some text
[07:49:42] <brunoais> pro, also, you should leave that to CSS and not javascript
[07:49:55] <brunoais> let CSS do what it does best
[07:50:12] <pro> i can show you?
[07:50:14] <decx> sounds like a css job, but that depends on the structure
[07:50:34] <pro> http://www.localdomain.co.za/
[07:50:37] <brunoais> now that I see it... yeah, it depends
[07:50:52] <pro> its that slider thing in the middle
[07:51:09] <pro> sorry its slow, im on a fraudband system :|
[07:53:19] <pro> its all the stuff on line 64 to line 75
[07:53:37] <brunoais> pro, why not use data-* elements to identify the relationship?
[07:53:56] <brunoais> for example
[07:54:54] <brunoais> <img src="images/fscc/01.png" data-step="1" data-position="10,250" data-in="top" data-listRelatesTo="1"    data-out="fade">
[07:54:54] <pro> like give each image a data-iid and each text thing a data-tid or something? and then somehow tell jquery to use data-iid and match the data-tid ?
[07:55:05] <brunoais> kinda, yes
[07:55:09] <pro> ok
[07:55:11] <brunoais> I'd say something like...
[07:56:13] <pro> i thought about that earlier, but not to sure how to do that, i know like nothing about jquery, just started playing with it the other day
[07:57:40] <brunoais> pro, http://pastebin.com/ABYNixZu
[07:57:46] <brunoais> I didn't test the code but this is the idea
[07:58:19] <brunoais> I wouldn't do exactly like that
[07:58:26] <pro> awesome, that looks good, i understand that, nice
[07:58:29] <brunoais> but that's already a nice way
[07:59:00] <pro> so if i use the data-whatever as a selector i think its called, then it needs [] around it?
[07:59:11] <brunoais> pro, It's a CSS selector
[07:59:38] <brunoais> pro, http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors
[07:59:43] <brunoais> that's the list of them
[08:00:03] <brunoais> jQuery has some extensions but, personally, I always prefer to stay away from them
[08:00:18] <pro> ok, thank you
[08:00:26] <brunoais> jQuery uses this:
[08:00:46] <brunoais> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document.querySelectorAll
[08:00:49] <pro> im going to try this
[08:00:50] <brunoais> so it can stay fast
[08:01:03] <brunoais> ok
[08:01:04] <brunoais> gl
[08:01:09] <pro> in firefox though?
[08:01:18] <brunoais> hum?
[08:01:33] <pro> i assume IE and chrome are different?
[08:01:36] <brunoais> nope
[08:01:41] <brunoais> but old browsers is
[08:01:44] <brunoais> and it is dead slow
[08:01:47] <pro> ok
[08:02:05] <brunoais> I usually cache the pointers to the elements in the DOM
[08:02:15] <brunoais> anyway, each case is a case
[08:02:30] <brunoais> yours specifically, as long as you don't do a lot, you don't need to care about it
[08:02:33] <pro> i dont know what that means yet, well, i understand what it means, just havent seen it
[08:02:41] <brunoais> I do it a lot :D
[08:03:15] <brunoais> then I get very fast, reponsive UI
[08:03:31] <brunoais> it's HTML + CSS + javascript in harmony
[08:03:32] <pro> i kind of understand jquery, but the bit i do understand i think is awesome
[08:03:51] <brunoais> Yeah, it's one of the best libs there is
[08:04:10] <decx> had a call but here's a quick hack http://jsfiddle.net/decx/pPn8L/ pro
[08:04:12] <pro> and im not very good with html/css but figure it out ok
[08:04:18] <brunoais> but it's still better to understand what's happening under the hood before using it well
[08:04:34] <brunoais> many ppl just ruin quickness of the page by anbusing some things
[08:04:48] <brunoais> pro, good luck
[08:05:07] <pro> yeah, making this page i have taken things out a lot cause they were too slow
[08:05:15] <brunoais> decx, I prefer to use CSS classes, though
[08:05:16] <BSaboia> why async: false is bad on a ajax call? I set an object value on a ajax call. what is the best way of setting it until timeout without setting async to false?
[08:05:20] <brunoais> I leave the job to the CSS
[08:05:37] <brunoais> BSaboia, while the AJAX call is being made in sync more, you are forcing all js in the apge to stop
[08:05:40] <brunoais> that's why it is bad
[08:05:46] <decx> that would entail restructuring the markup
[08:05:58] <brunoais> decx, why?
[08:06:16] <brunoais> decx, did you see my suggestion to him?
[08:06:16] <brunoais> http://pastebin.com/ABYNixZu
[08:06:26] <decx> because you can't create a distinctve relativion from siblings in pure css
[08:06:33] <decx> relation
[08:06:35] <brunoais> Ah no
[08:06:41] <BSaboia> brunoais, OK. but then, how to do it in a more proper fashion? because I can't continue until the ajax call "complets" (or at least timesout)
[08:06:51] <brunoais> decx, I didn't give him a pure CSS answer ;)
[08:07:03] <pro> decx, i understand, that is what i was sitting writing now, but this is cleaner, can i change css() to just use a class i have in the css?
[08:07:08] <decx> well with a bit of restructuring that would be css only brunoais ^^
[08:07:10] <brunoais> BSaboia, finish the script there and give it callback
[08:07:15] <pro> although this is so small i can just do it inline
[08:07:22] <brunoais> decx, probably, yes
[08:07:28] <decx> yeah you can just use a class pro
[08:07:44] <brunoais> decx, class is best, IMO
[08:07:51] <pro> this is a very awesome little 'language'
[08:07:53] <brunoais> you can change appearence just by changing the CSS
[08:08:17] <brunoais> CSS does not require testing because it is super simple
[08:09:09] <decx> try doing something with perspective and translate3d and then we'll see if css doesn't require testing :>
[08:09:31] <brunoais> BSaboia, the javascript way is to give callbacks for jobs that take some time to be executted
[08:09:51] <pro> yeah, i have no idea what you guys are saying now
[08:09:53] <pro> :D
[08:10:01] <brunoais> decx, Hum... yeah, I still haven't used those...
[08:10:09] <brunoais> only translate2D
[08:10:13] <brunoais> AKA translate
[08:10:27] <brunoais> brb
[08:10:34] <BSaboia> brunoais, like in C?
[08:11:38] <brunoais> BSaboia, when you use async calls or when you wait for signals/messages?
[08:11:49] <brunoais> BSaboia, if so, yes, kinda like C
[08:12:02] <BSaboia> so I just pass a funcion to i t
[08:12:02] <brunoais> except js has many alternatives like annonymous functions
[08:12:08] <BSaboia> from what I am reading
[08:12:13] <brunoais> yes
[08:12:16] <brunoais> just read the manual ;)
[08:12:21] <BSaboia> yea, it seems ok
[08:12:26] <BSaboia> thanks
[08:12:31] <brunoais> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:12:54] <brunoais> you need to make the fail callback and success callback
[08:17:22] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[08:22:38] <pro> thank you brunoais and decx
[08:22:49] <brunoais> you are welcome
[08:22:58] <pro> very much :D i learned some nice new things
[08:24:26] <brunoais> :)
[08:24:40] <BillCriswell> I want to punch everything in the face today.
[08:31:19] <decx> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[08:53:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Even that face!
[08:57:28] <MikeD_> it is that kind of day today
[08:58:09] <MikeD_> i keep crashing the environment hosting the browser running this script, so i have to keep logging in every time.  (it sucks)
[09:05:04] <brunoais> MikeD_, what script?
[09:06:36] <MikeD_> i think loadScript() keeps firing success... and it looks like a runaway loop
[09:15:44] <decx> there's a typo in your "even" BillCriswell it's supposed to be "especially"
[09:18:21] <brunoais> MikeD_, jQuery's loadScript()?
[09:18:30] <MikeD_> yes
[09:18:50] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, it's a terrible face.
[09:19:27] <MikeD_> wait, no... a wrapper for jQuery.ajax
[09:20:03] <duch_kazatel> wooo it's friday!
[09:20:46] <BillCriswell> It's not friday enough. I need at least... 3/4 Friday to be happy.
[09:20:51] <BillCriswell> Friday and 3/4
[09:21:19] <duch_kazatel> i have gigs this weekend.  i'm excited for it.
[09:22:47] <BillCriswell> Like code gigs?
[09:22:51] <duch_kazatel> music gigs.
[09:22:53] <BillCriswell> I associate gigs with music
[09:22:57] <BillCriswell> Ah, nice.
[09:26:32] <BillCriswell> What do you play music wise?
[09:27:30] <duch_kazatel> we only have one rule: it had to be made in the 80's.  everything from van halen to SRV to the go-gos to pat benatar to journey to inxs
[09:27:48] <BillCriswell> Niiice.
[09:27:54] <BillCriswell> Well, besides Journey.
[09:28:11] <duch_kazatel> hah.  i didn't like journey before, but it's grown on me.
[09:28:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm a big SRV fan so i eat that stuff up.
[09:28:23] <decx> i added explosions to the markup game http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Sg77m/18/
[09:29:00] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:29:08] <loincloth> what are some examples of jquery plugins which extend on the default behaviors of jquery-ui ?
[09:29:19] <nhulea> def leppard!
[09:29:32] <nhulea> is that stevie ray vaughn ?
[09:29:33] <loincloth> i am looking to do something similar and am at the research/avoid reinventing the wheel phase :)
[09:29:39] <duch_kazatel> *vaughan, and yeah.
[09:29:49] <duch_kazatel> loincloth what are you looking at doing?
[09:29:53] <nhulea> wrd yeah cold shot is fucking awesome
[09:29:56] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I got out to drink too much, when Journey comes on at the end of the night like it always does I go outside.
[09:30:08] <nhulea> haha
[09:30:08] <BillCriswell> Don't Stop Believing would be the ultimate torture song for me.
[09:30:13] <duch_kazatel> cold shot is a cover - fun fact.
[09:30:14] <nhulea> amen
[09:30:19] <nhulea> no shit
[09:30:25] <nhulea> I did not know that
[09:30:32] <duch_kazatel> i am obsessed with the man :)
[09:30:49] <decx> even if its good, my contrarian nature won't allow me to like any pop
[09:31:03] <nhulea> wrd he is fucking awesome its weird the people I roll with never mention him its usually just me haha
[09:31:03] <BillCriswell> I am really picky about my pop.
[09:31:23] <nhulea> its all about Kano for me these days
[09:31:28] <nhulea> haha
[09:31:39] <loincloth> duch_kazatel: as i said, i am interested in techniques for extending default event behaviors in jquery-ui in a way that is implicit for end users
[09:31:39] <BillCriswell> Outkast and Gnarls Barkley is as pop as I get for the most part.
[09:31:55] <duch_kazatel> loincloth usually you just use $.extend() iirc.
[09:32:21] <duch_kazatel> i've been listening to a lot of old R&B and Soul and blues lately.  marlena shaw and James Gang and stuff
[09:32:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: My friend Ciaira always told to me listen to SRV, never did though.
[09:32:35] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: journey is like the ultimate bar music tho ;)
[09:32:46] <duch_kazatel> gnarf yep.  that's why we have to play it :)
[09:32:56] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: what you play?
[09:32:58] <duch_kazatel> guitar
[09:33:29] <gnarf> okay so some day, we need to find a drummer and a singer in #jquery -- get you on guitar, ben_alman on bass ;)
[09:33:31] <BillCriswell> As a joke my brother got me like some trance/dupstep Journey cover CD.
[09:33:50] <duch_kazatel> wait like the ben_alman?
[09:33:52] <nhulea> oukast is good but rap if your trying to listen some quality shit but I have all over the rap these days theres zro, killer mike and el-p, lil boosie , meek mill all these rappers are doing some cool new shit
[09:33:54] <duch_kazatel> because I also sing.
[09:34:23] <nhulea> hyoly shit trance dubstep wtf is that
[09:34:34] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I mostly stick to rap from the 90's and back haha
[09:34:36] <duch_kazatel> and BillCriswell listen to SRV.  all of it.
[09:35:11] <gnarf> i was out at a bar last night - heard a song or two from this album: http://open.spotify.com/user/gnarf37/playlist/2LN1czBvf0gD1O0mnlK6WI pretty happy with it
[09:35:19] <nhulea> BillCriswell: there it is http://www.beatport.com/release/top-edm-hits-2013-best-of-top-dubstep-trance-electro-downtempo-and-psytrance/1123690
[09:35:30] <nhulea> top 2013 hits for you
[09:35:32] <duch_kazatel> including bowie's "let's dance" album

[09:35:47] <nhulea> or radio gaga queen
[09:35:59] <nhulea> "radio gaga"
[09:36:32] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I will consider this, but my taste in music is usually dirty, rhaspy voices dudes with guitars haha.
[09:36:57] <duch_kazatel> you mean like john lee hooker?
[09:37:06] <nhulea> or kurt cobain?
[09:37:07] <decx> srv is too classic rock for me, i like kyuss
[09:37:16] <nhulea> kyuss
[09:37:23] <nhulea> you mean KISS
[09:37:26] <duch_kazatel> whaaat?!  SRV is more blue/rock to me.
[09:37:34] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Maybe even rougher.
[09:37:46] <decx> liking kiss is just piggybacking our parents culture, kyuss is the shit
[09:37:53] <decx> or was...
[09:37:53] <duch_kazatel> kyuss is good times.
[09:38:39] <decx> they came here for a reunion tour, but without josh homme on the guitar it's just not the same
[09:38:48] <duch_kazatel> doesn't make much sense imo.
[09:39:51] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sndqSG-h_E is my favorite. It's not a cover of Cash's.
[09:40:12] <BillCriswell> The dudes second language is english and I think he writes better than most natives.
[09:40:18] <duch_kazatel> ah.  this kind of stuff.
[09:40:53] <duch_kazatel> primal as hell.  i dig it.
[09:41:08] <gnarf> My music interests are like - all over the board, from old country to dubstep pretty much
[09:41:31] <gnarf> I used to run sound at a small venue in my home town
[09:41:43] <gnarf> never played an instrument tho
[09:41:49] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I just can't get into anything too electronic.
[09:41:56] <pro> i like making music too
[09:41:57] <decx> no use in bothering to think about genres, it's all about inherent soul in music no matter what medium
[09:42:01] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I keep telling myself I'll pick up a guitar. I never do.
[09:42:07] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell do it!
[09:42:11] <gnarf> BillCriswell: i can't get by without anything too electronic :)
[09:42:21] <duch_kazatel> decx genres are convenient when trying to find things you like ;)
[09:42:50] <gnarf> BillCriswell: My playlist "code jams" is like a collection of deep bass, great beats and minimal lyrics :)
[09:42:55] <pro> this is what i make, im not that good yet, still learning https://soundcloud.com/anonnroom
[09:43:01] <gnarf> pretty much my working soundtrack
[09:43:13] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I'm all about the lyrics unless it's really heavy.
[09:43:14] <decx> that's what napster was for in the 90s, download everything. sort shit out later duch_kazatel ;)
[09:43:34] <BillCriswell> decx: I still have all the songs I downloaded from Napster haha
[09:43:37] <duch_kazatel> decx hahahaha
[09:43:39] <gnarf> BillCriswell: I find lyrics in music while writing code can often distract me unless the lyric itself is just like a sample/repeated the whole time
[09:43:42] <pro> except you never sorted them
[09:43:51] <BillCriswell> It's mostly old emo bands but yeah.
[09:44:01] <nhulea> like pavement ?
[09:44:01] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I can totally understand that.
[09:44:08] <gnarf> hah pavement
[09:44:23] <nhulea> thats like the only emo band i know
[09:44:26] <Ownix> anyone here familiar with the Jquery Validation plugin?
[09:44:35] <duch_kazatel> Ownix just ask your question.
[09:44:42] <pro> my ex once sat and took a dir i had with abour 2000 songs just dumped in and sorted them all
[09:44:50] <Ownix> All I want to do is make sure theres a valid email in a textbox
[09:44:54] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Yes, even emoer.
[09:45:08] <pro> Ownix, html5 can do that?
[09:45:10] <Ownix> I cant do ('#form').validate
[09:45:11] <decx> type="email" in the input, validate() sorts that out automagically
[09:45:21] <nhulea> Pro that was your severance package
[09:45:34] <Ownix> decx: ASP.NET wont use it                 <asp:TextBox type="email" ID="emailTxt" runat="server" placeholder="email" required></asp:TextBox>
[09:45:48] <BillCriswell> I'm talking like Get Up Kids, Texas Is The Reason, etc.
[09:46:00] <decx> damn i hate these ridiculous conventions to handle html in some languages
[09:46:02] <Ownix> It blatantly ignores me, then reaches through my computer screen and slaps me
[09:46:39] <BillCriswell> gnarf: How do you feel about bands like Explosions In The Sky and Godspeed You Black Emperor?
[09:46:55] <gnarf> Godspeed was my "fall asleep" music for a while
[09:47:09] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Haha, same here.
[09:47:25] <gnarf> http://open.spotify.com/track/5K37fGQ8vEatex2PrzND94 this track (and the next one on the album) are pretty awesome
[09:47:26] <b-ot> gnarf: ♩ High Society by Bear Hands ▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮▮
[09:47:47] <BillCriswell> I guess I should sign up for spotify.
[09:47:47] <decx> Ownix rules: { field: { required: true,email: true } }
[09:47:53] <gnarf> anyway, as much as I'm loving the discussion of music :)
[09:48:00] <gnarf> it's a bit -ot for #jquery
[09:48:02] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:48:21] <gnarf> lets try our best to only talk about it if noone like Ownix needs help with something :)
[09:48:35] <Ownix> decx: am I allowed to use any jquery selector? $('#emailTxt').validate({ rules: { field: { required: true,email: true } } });
[09:48:51] <decx> you have to validate the form element
[09:48:53] <gnarf> i think validate wants to be on the form doesn't it?
[09:48:57] <decx> as validate binds on submit
[09:49:01] <gnarf> ^
[09:49:14] <Ownix> hmm. all my pages share one master form which could cause me big issues
[09:49:16] <nhulea> how bout Power Station ? any one like Robert Palmer with Duran Duran ?
[09:49:18] <pro> Ownix, why do you need jquery to validate it? cant you just use html5's validation?
[09:49:23] <BillCriswell> Also needs a require attribute on the input element.
[09:49:41] <decx> no when you put require in the rules
[09:49:43] <decx> not*
[09:49:44] <Ownix> pro: what do you mean? can you show me?
[09:49:50] <Ownix> Well the thing is, im not submitting data
[09:50:01] <Ownix> my code behind grabs the data on a button click event
[09:50:16] <duch_kazatel> isn't that server-side processing though?
[09:50:18] <Ownix> saves it, then the postback runs, checks the viewstate for a success message and shows the user "success"
[09:50:25] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: yes
[09:50:26] <BillCriswell> gnarf: This one you linked reminds me of Q and not U for some reason.
[09:50:39] <decx> not feeling that bear hands track
[09:50:44] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: technically the submit has to run though
[09:50:58] <Ownix> So jquery validation WILL work if I can just bind the damn thing to my control
[09:51:02] <gnarf> BillCriswell: decx: I got this like MGMT meets something slower feel
[09:51:06] <loincloth> duch_kazatel: yah more or less the low level technique i imagined i was just having trouble finding the best spot to hook in and was looking for examples of what others have done
[09:51:30] <loincloth> duch_kazatel: did a proof of concept overloading $.ui.tabs.prototype.load, for example, and seems to work
[09:51:37] <gnarf> Ownix: you can use .valid() on a form that you have called .validate() on
[09:51:38] <gnarf> http://jqueryvalidation.org/valid
[09:51:51] <duch_kazatel> jquery ui itself is a good example - doesn't it extend some of jquery's methods itself?
[09:51:52] <pro> Ownix, in the form, the input where you make it type="text" make it type="email"
[09:52:04] <gnarf> loincloth: extend that widget instead of duck punching load
[09:52:20] <pro> Ownix, then it will validate it on its own
[09:52:25] <Ownix> pro: that wont work in an ASP textbox control
[09:52:35] <loincloth> gnarf: hmm ok i'll look into that
[09:52:37] <Ownix> gnarf: ty ill look at this
[09:52:43] <duch_kazatel> Ownix it's all markup on the frontend - it shouldn't matter what generated it.
[09:52:47] <pro> is asp not using html?
[09:52:52] <duch_kazatel> asp uses html.
[09:52:59] <BillCriswell> Do they have an option?
[09:53:07] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: well it does lol type="email" does nothing
[09:53:29] <pro> so then it will work, it doesnt matter about the lang that makes the page,
[09:53:38] <pro> Ownix, is it an html5?
[09:53:48] <pro> Ownix, what is the doctype ?
[09:53:57] <duch_kazatel> oooh that's right - you're having trouble getting it to generate the right control, yeah?
[09:54:07] <loincloth> gnarf: will that work if i want to extend the core and not create a new widget which extends the core?
[09:54:08] <Ownix> pro: how do I check? <!DOCTYPE html>
[09:54:12] <duch_kazatel> Ownix i vaguely remember that kind of wizardry with ASP back in the day.
[09:54:13] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: what do you mean?
[09:54:18] <gnarf> loincloth: $.widget("my.tabs", { load: function() { this._super(); } });
[09:54:20] <pro> yes
[09:54:30] <pro> Ownix, look here http://diveintohtml5.info/forms.html
[09:54:34] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: yeah it doesnt behave right, when it gets auto generated it might break whatever events or javascrit crap attached to it
[09:54:37] <gnarf> loincloth: then ".tabs() will be bound to your tabs instead of ui tabs
[09:54:37] <duch_kazatel> Ownix "type="email" does nothing" meaning it doesn't render out the attribute?
[09:55:01] <loincloth> gnarf: hmm ok
[09:55:09] <loincloth> gnarf, duch_kazatel: thx
[09:55:15] <Ownix> pro: are you familiar with ASP.NET? <asp:TextBox type="email" ID="emailTxt" runat="server" placeholder="email" required></asp:TextBox> isnt the same as <input> even though it is later rendered on the page as such.
[09:55:21] <gnarf> er sorry
[09:55:21] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: let me check
[09:55:26] <gnarf> messed that up
[09:55:33] <decx> i find the concept of pseudo asp tags that get converted into html ridiculous
[09:55:35] <duch_kazatel> Ownix it doesn't matter once it hits thr browser.
[09:55:39] <decx> who thought that was a good idea
[09:55:48] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:  rendered output <input name="ctl00$MainContent$emailTxt" value="tberra@marisolintl.com" id="MainContent_emailTxt" type="email" placeholder="email" required="">
[09:55:55] <duch_kazatel> decx the same kind of people who like coldfusion.
[09:55:57] <pro> Ownix, no, i dont know much about asp, havent used windows since '96
[09:55:59] <gnarf> loincloth: lame example: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide19
[09:56:12] <pro> i must go, the kids want me to feed them...
[09:56:15] <pro> bbl
[09:56:16] <duch_kazatel> Ownix yep - so that's ok.  only the rendered markup is important.
[09:56:20] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: when I hit "submit" everything submits without a hitch. I will have changed that email to not be valid of course to test it
[09:56:23] <duch_kazatel> the javascript binds to that, not the ASP
[09:56:32] <loincloth> gnarf: great, looks like where i want to be
[09:56:35] <loincloth> thx again
[09:56:39] <loincloth> lunch time...
[09:56:40] <duch_kazatel> gnarf++
[09:57:47] <decx> why doesn't this widget factory slider center the next box when i click on it
[09:57:55] <gnarf> loincloth: ^ thats actually the technique we use to polyfill the old APIs - we extend the widget itself :)
[09:58:02] * TViernion has retunred
[10:00:21] <TViernion> I need to up my scroll back..
[10:01:57] <TViernion> decx I think it was you talking about the fragments using to refresh my "divs"
[10:02:15] <duch_kazatel> i need to get better about not writing 50+ line functions.
[10:03:28] <decx> i wrote something about that TViernion but not directed to you :> but yes. collect appends, add to document once
[10:03:46] <decx> whatever you want to use, strings, fragments, arrays
[10:04:13] <duch_kazatel> basically, don't touch the rendered document until you really need to, and do a single big swap, instead of a bunch of little ones.
[10:04:14] <TViernion> ahhh...
[10:04:27] <TViernion> i was attempt to update only a single div in a page using the same page on a load.. or something.
[10:04:33] <decx> ah right that
[10:04:42] <BillCriswell> Hmm... iTunes match is being stupid.
[10:04:44] <decx> yeah focus your php output
[10:05:27] <decx> if you just want to load a certain fragment of content, just serve that fragment with php, don't get a whole php page and pick and choose what you want to display from it
[10:05:46] <nhulea> BillCriswell: when was it ever smart ?
[10:06:15] <decx> first mistake was using itu... never mind
[10:06:24] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I usually love it, just right now it doesn't seem be be updating my playlists.
[10:06:28] <decx> i'm not gonna go on a tirade as to how foobar2000 is better ^^
[10:06:32] <Ownix> lol a dev has been working on having our system send automated emails, this was a test email "Trying to send this to a group of people.  Let me know if you don't get it."
[10:06:35] <Ownix> tell me whats wrong with that
[10:06:43] <BillCriswell> The playlists on my phone are different from the ones on my computer. That's not right.
[10:06:53] <nhulea> Ownix: jesus christ
[10:07:04] <decx> he means: if you don't understand the concept as to why i email several people, ask me
[10:07:23] <Ownix> decx: I really dont think so lol
[10:07:26] <decx> or maybe it's a joke :o
[10:07:32] <Ownix> ^ i want to believe
[10:07:50] <TViernion> Ownix, i'm assuming maybe everyone would stop, collaberate and .. sorry..
[10:08:11] <TViernion> can i load just a single div that way decx?
[10:08:28] <TViernion> the problem is .. i need all the calculations of hte page to run before loading that "div"
[10:09:19] <fatguylaughing> Where would I start on trying to use jQuery to make something like this http://codecanyon.net/item/booking-calendar-pro-jquery-plugin/full_screen_preview/244645
[10:11:00] <BillCriswell> fatguylaughing: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ maybe?
[10:11:17] <decx> let's say oyu have a php page <div id="one"><? data ?></div> <div id="two><? data2 ?></div>. you could load part of that whole page with $('container').load('page.php #one') but that would waste resources on unused stuff. it'd be better to put a condition in your php to only draw specific content. so you can .load('page.php?onlyonedata') instead
[10:11:35] <BillCriswell> decx: You better not be running php with short tags.
[10:11:50] <BillCriswell> You monster.
[10:11:56] <decx> i only touch php when i do wordpress nowadays
[10:12:05] <Es0teric> has anyone here used masonry yet?
[10:12:31] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric just ask your question :)
[10:12:35] <BillCriswell> fatguylaughing: full calendar, splash of ui-dialog... should get you pretty close.
[10:12:36] <decx> the questionmark is actually the only thing i remember -.-
[10:12:52] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, it's not pretty.
[10:13:15] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel what? lol
[10:13:17] <BillCriswell> It's the only server side language I'm comfortable with for now. Though I'm picking up Node pretty good.
[10:13:22] <BillCriswell> sailsjs is a lot of fun so far.
[10:13:32] <decx> the php is the nice part about working with wordpress themes, then you see 5000 scriptincludes
[10:13:42] <decx> 4 times jquery, 15 plugins
[10:13:47] <decx> wat
[10:14:10] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Es0teric
[10:14:11] <b-ot> Es0teric: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:14:16] <decx> servers are literally dying
[10:14:25] <decx> dieing?
[10:14:32] <TViernion> dying
[10:14:34] <decx> ding
[10:14:39] <greendot> dong
[10:14:44] <duch_kazatel> the witch is dead
[10:14:45] <decx> die hexe ist tod
[10:15:03] <TViernion> follow the yellow brick lolly pop
[10:16:29] <duch_kazatel> jesus why is coldfusion so sloooowwww
[10:16:48] <duch_kazatel> it has this initial compile when you restart the application that takes ages.
[10:16:58] <greendot> needs to warm a little bit first
[10:17:09] <duch_kazatel> my cpu maybe.
[10:17:19] <greendot> whats your cpu
[10:17:42] <duch_kazatel> core i7 @ 2.7.
[10:18:03] <greendot> laptop?
[10:18:10] <duch_kazatel> yep.  w/ 16 gigs of ram.
[10:18:15] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: Thanks :)
[10:18:20] * TViernion hands duch_kazatel a CPU warmer
[10:18:25] <TViernion> Sterno is the best :)
[10:18:29] <BillCriswell> fatguylaughing: No problem.
[10:18:59] <BillCriswell> fatguylaughing: I helped a friend with it a while ago and it seemed intuitive enough, but I don't have too much experience with it to be honest.
[10:19:48] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: No worries. I just currently have a UI issue and would like to use an interactive calendar to solve it.
[10:20:09] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: It would make it easier for the end user (client) to use the system.
[10:21:15] <BillCriswell> Understood.
[10:21:56] <BillCriswell> I really hate calendars right now. Working on a project and the form for entering events is SO insane because you can have repeating events at different times on different days and it's just.. terrible.
[10:22:38] <MikeD_>        is the problem just that's it's confusing, or is the way you're coding dates not conducive to the requirements?
[10:24:21] <BillCriswell> The form to enter that information and not have it be too confusing is tough mostly.
[10:24:36] <BillCriswell> I'm not doing the date logic thankfully.
[10:24:45] <MikeD_> yeah, complex UI sucks
[10:24:50] <duch_kazatel> agreed.
[10:25:07] <BillCriswell> Repeating events just make my brain hurt when I think abotu how they're stored.
[10:25:12] <MikeD_> especially when the "customer" tells you to do dumb things because they don't understand their own problem
[10:26:18] <BillCriswell> Repeat an event every 3 days, easy enough. Make a special case for when it falls on a wednesday... annoying. Make a special case for thursday to be at 1:00 instead of 8:00...
[10:26:27] <thebope> duch_kazatel, - That the macbook pro?
[10:26:40] <duch_kazatel> thebope nope.  i'm personally a windows guy.
[10:26:49] <thebope> I have very similar specs on my pro
[10:27:00] <thebope> i7 quad 2.6, 16gigs ram
[10:27:01] <duch_kazatel> yep - our mac guys have almsot the same machines.
[10:27:10] <thebope> I like having unix on the back end
[10:27:20] <thebope> but I've never developed on Windows except for a very short stint
[10:27:21] <decx> 1 or 1.5k more expensive?
[10:27:25] <thebope> I guess it's just a mtter of comfort
[10:27:28] <BillCriswell> I don't think I could even put 16GB of RAM to work.
[10:27:37] <thebope> I do for my vision processing work
[10:27:43] <thebope> and I guess it's just future proof
[10:28:03] <BillCriswell> Yeah it makes sense.
[10:28:06] <thebope> decx, probably relatively comparable. High quality screen. 15.4 inches. flash hard drive
[10:28:20] <BillCriswell> I love me some SSD.
[10:28:24] <thebope> oh it's so nice
[10:28:28] <duch_kazatel> i actually switched from mac to windows years ago and never looked back.  and i LOVE my ssd too.
[10:28:34] <thebope> Everything is so snappy
[10:28:47] <thebope> Yea, it's just preference
[10:28:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What made you switch?
[10:28:56] <thebope> there's a ton of development resources for windows
[10:29:02] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell games.  woulda been a little over 10 years ago now.
[10:29:11] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ah, fair enough.
[10:29:12] <thebope> Oh yea, I'm not a big gamer
[10:29:22] <thebope> I think I might buy Starcraft 2 though
[10:29:38] <duch_kazatel> i'm not much any more either, but every time i try to use a mac i miss my windows setup.
[10:29:59] <thebope> haha yea I could see that
[10:30:12] <thebope> Using Linux at work bugs me sometimes where I'm used to my set up at home
[10:30:15] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: Can you think of a good book for creating a jQuery Plugin. So I have some explanation on what I’m looking at?
[10:30:24] <duch_kazatel> we have one or two folks running linux.
[10:30:50] <thebope> meeting
[10:30:51] <thebope> :/
[10:30:54] <thebope> I hate meetings
[10:30:55] <BillCriswell> fatguylaughing: I'm really not sure what the best resource for that is now.
[10:30:55] <thebope> later!
[10:31:14] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: No worries thanks for the help!
[10:31:34] <duch_kazatel> there's always the site.
[10:31:36] <decx> not a book but http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[10:31:44] <duch_kazatel> was about to link that.
[10:32:10] <BillCriswell> I usually start here... but I also don't write many plugins: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/master/src/jquery.boilerplate.js
[10:33:17] <Brycetron> @duch_kazatel Morning man!
[10:33:21] <duch_kazatel> good morning.

[10:35:12] <fatguylaughing> BillCriswell: Thanks again
[10:35:40] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[10:50:36] <pzp> >> var i = 0; var timer = setInterval(function() {console.log(i); i++;}, 2000); clearInterval(timer); console.log(timer);
[10:55:25] <haemly> Hey guys, I was wondering how to approach formatting date such as todays date, to format similiar to : Friday April 25th, 2014
[10:55:42] <duch_kazatel> by using the Date() object.
[10:55:47] <duch_kazatel> !mdn date
[10:55:49] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Date - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[10:59:53] <pzp> Hey
[11:00:22] <pzp> What value will my variable for a setInterval() have when I clearInterval()?
[11:01:05] <decx> var stuff = setInterval clearInterval(stuff)
[11:01:29] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/e6kvU/
[11:02:18] <pzp> duch_kazatel: JSFiddle doesn't show console for me
[11:02:28] <duch_kazatel> pzp you open up the console of your browser...
[11:02:30] <ryannielson> I have a change event on a select box. Is there a way to prevent it from triggering if I set the value in a certain spot, but I want the event to trigger otherwise.
[11:03:12] <decx> disable the option
[11:05:00] <ryannielson> decx: You responding to me? If you, what do you mean? Like disable the option I'm going to to set as the val, set the val, and then enable the field again?
[11:06:09] <decx> if you don't want an option in a select to be available you set the disabled attribute, if you don't want to disable certain options you can't rely on the change event
[11:16:22] <ryannielson> decx: Well I moreso meant disabling the chagne event when programmatically changing the val of the select box.
[11:19:04] <decx> it doesn't fire change when you just do $('select').val()
[11:19:49] <ryannielson> decx: It seems to be on my end
[11:20:10] <ryannielson> decx: Wait, nevermind I'm dumb.
[11:28:27] <hocza> how can should I add .on click feature to a new item that i just prepend() to the <ul> without giving the on click again for the previously existing items.
[11:28:37] <hocza> -can
[11:28:58] <duch_kazatel> delegation.
[11:29:09] <duch_kazatel> $('ul').on('click', 'li', function(){});
[11:29:25] <duch_kazatel> where ul is your parent UL and li is whatever selector you want to fire on.
[11:30:39] <hocza> hm
[11:31:35] <hocza> and in my case: $('.checkbox input').on("click", function(){ ...
[11:31:46] <BillCriswell> No no no.
[11:31:58] <duch_kazatel> $('.checkbox').on('click', 'input' function(){
[11:32:01] <hocza> (it is a task manager btw)
[11:32:05] <hocza> hmm
[11:32:16] <decx> is there a better way to merge objects than this? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/wPtmW/
[11:33:20] <hocza> Then I should make a fuction, and trigger it everytime i prepend my task list, right?
[11:33:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Hmm
[11:37:37] <hocza> hm it was still dropped the alert for me a lot of times. however I was so stupid... i just should call $('.checkbox').off("click", 'input'); before putting the .on('click' ...) on it :)
[11:37:38] <BillCriswell> decx: The only other way that comes to mind is var $els = $(); $els.push( a[0] ); $els.push( b[0] );
[11:37:43] <hocza> Now works like a charm
[11:37:45] <duch_kazatel> no.
[11:37:53] <duch_kazatel> don't add/remove events like that hocza
[11:38:40] <hocza> oh :|
[11:38:45] <duch_kazatel> set one binding.
[11:38:49] <duch_kazatel> don't add new bindings later.
[11:41:04] <hocza> then how my new element(s) get the event?
[11:42:04] <hocza> you know, when I prepend the checkbox not working
[11:42:14] <BillCriswell> decx: var $collection = $(); $collection = $collection.add(a); $collection = $collection.add(b);.. kind of stinks you can't just push on a jQuery element?
[11:42:19] <hocza> $('#pending-tasks').prepend('<li class="list-group-item animated bounceInDown"><div class="media"><div class="pull-left m-t-sm"><label class="checkbox m-n i-checks"><input type="checkbox"><i></i></label></div><div class="media-body"><div><a href="#">'+task+'</a></div><small class="text-muted">'+date+'</small></div></div></li>');
[11:42:55] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ hocza
[11:42:56] <b-ot> hocza: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:43:36] <hocza> okay sorry i'm new here:) even in jquery thanks ! :)
[11:51:00] <decx> well if there's no obvious other better way i'm quite happy with add ;)
[11:51:04] <decx> BillCriswell
[11:51:40] <decx> a = a.add(new)
[11:52:15] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, wrote that haha
[11:52:29] <BillCriswell> Ah, kinda!
[11:52:50] <decx> because i used that in the markup game to update the collection of constantly changing elements
[11:53:01] <decx> bullets/enemies
[11:57:19] <hocza> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/ApBDb/
[11:58:58] <BillCriswell> decx: Didn't you say markup games are stupid yesterday or something?
[11:59:09] <duch_kazatel> hocza okay so what isn't working?
[11:59:24] <hocza> it is working but you said not to remove events like this. :)
[11:59:29] <hocza> with .off()
[12:00:07] <Velveeta> hi all.. long time listener, first time caller, i love your show... um, is there a jquery plugin for when you click a button on a form, the form submits? not like an ajax submit, just a regular one...
[12:00:30] <duch_kazatel> hocza which event are you worried about?
[12:00:36] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I think you need to use underscore for that.
[12:00:58] <Velveeta> billcriswell: is there a jquery in that? my boss said it needed more jquery
[12:01:17] <BillCriswell> There's actually 3.
[12:01:20] <decx> BillCriswell doesn't mean i'm not checking it out :>
[12:01:25] <Velveeta> nice
[12:01:27] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[12:01:29] <hocza> I do not know. Just you said "don't add/remove events like that hocza". But maybe it was just because you did not see me full code. :)
[12:01:47] <hocza> so duch_kazatel if it is good, then I wont worry :)
[12:01:50] <duch_kazatel> hocza why are you binding your listeners inbside of a function.
[12:01:54] <duch_kazatel> like that?
[12:01:57] <Velveeta> so would it be like $('form').underscore('post') or something?
[12:02:21] <hocza> I did not had a better idea.
[12:02:25] <ngharo> Velveeta: forms have submit() method
[12:02:28] <hocza> have*
[12:02:32] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Just put only that into your HTML file and you're good to go.
[12:02:46] <Velveeta> billcriswell: thanks, this channel rocks!
[12:03:00] <duch_kazatel> hocza you didn't even do what i suggested ;)
[12:03:07] <ngharo> i think BillCriswell is bullshitting you
[12:03:12] <Velveeta> now, on to my next question... is there a jquery plugin to recreate all of facebook?
[12:03:21] <hocza> duch_kazatel: the binding? :)
[12:03:28] <duch_kazatel> hocza http://jsfiddle.net/ApBDb/1/
[12:03:33] <duch_kazatel> that might not work, but it'll be close.
[12:03:59] <Velveeta> ngharo: i'm just screwing around.. i don't ever trust anything bill says.. i'm pretty sure that's not even his name
[12:04:04] <decx> Velveeta $.fn.facebook = function(){ alert(alert(alert()))}
[12:04:05] <BillCriswell> $('form').underscore('facebookplz')
[12:04:26] <Velveeta> bill: man, that underscore plugin does it all, huh!
[12:04:30] <duch_kazatel> hocza the idea is you bind a single listener to an element that exists at the time of binding, and let thge delegation take care of the rest.
[12:04:36] <decx> on that note.... http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Sg77m/19/show/
[12:04:36] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:05:20] <Velveeta> i took a pto day today, slept till noon, and it's a slow facebook day, so i find myself here, using my brain instead of turning it off
[12:05:24] <BillCriswell> I just came across a stack overflow question so confusing I closed my entire window.
[12:05:29] <Velveeta> i blame bill
[12:05:49] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I'd blame me too.
[12:06:03] <Velveeta> git blame billcriswell
[12:06:14] <Velveeta> i'm kind of curious what this SO question was now...
[12:06:19] <hocza> duch_kazatel: yes, and it is working with the existing item. But when I add another one, it won't have the event. If I fire the .on() again, then the older elements will do twice the given function. :)
[12:06:44] <hocza> or I'm really in the dark and I did not get the point :(
[12:06:46] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: 23301043
[12:07:19] <Velveeta> ouch
[12:07:46] <Velveeta> "I am new to javascript and jquery." -- "and english" -- ftfy
[12:07:47] <BillCriswell> I want to help, but I feel like I'd need to explain html and javascrip from the ground up.
[12:10:09] <BillCriswell> I could go for a slice of pizza.
[12:12:41] <Velveeta> i've been trying to eat better since new year's.. i think i had pizza once since then.. we almost broke down last night and had it again
[12:12:51] <hocza> okay, fixed it I think. Yes it is still in the function, but It won't remove events from all elements, just give the event to the newly added element: http://jsfiddle.net/ApBDb/4/
[12:12:53] <hocza> :)
[12:13:02] <Velveeta> instead, we broke down slightly less and went to a sub shop, where my wife had the guts of hers as a salad, and i had mine as a wrap..... it was still phenomenal
[12:14:09] <duch_kazatel> hocza you don't need the function is what i'm saying.
[12:14:33] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha, "sub"
[12:14:41] <BillCriswell> Hoagies FTW
[12:14:50] <Velveeta> lol, i was about to guess 'hoagie'
[12:15:05] <BillCriswell> Do you say pop or soda?
[12:15:17] <duch_kazatel> hocza you don't need to run that function at all if you do what I showed you.
[12:15:26] <Velveeta> i say either soda or coke
[12:15:33] <duch_kazatel> ewww
[12:15:38] <duch_kazatel> freaks in here.
[12:15:50] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Ok good.
[12:15:55] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You say pop out in cali?
[12:16:17] <duch_kazatel> soda.
[12:16:19] <hocza> duch_kazatel: were you suggesting this? http://jsfiddle.net/ApBDb/9/
[12:16:19] <duch_kazatel> not "coke"
[12:16:21] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[12:16:22] <duch_kazatel> my wife says "pop"
[12:16:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: sub? hero? hoagie?
[12:16:41] <duch_kazatel> sub.
[12:16:46] <MikeD_> hoagie
[12:16:56] <Velveeta> i love that this is a perfectly valid conversation here in texas: "what can i get you to drink?" "i'll just have a coke" "ok, what kind?" "dr. pepper"
[12:16:58] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: East coast?
[12:17:02] <MikeD_> the preferred sandwich of Hog Island workers...
[12:17:11] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Really? Interesting.
[12:17:15] <Velveeta> yep :D
[12:17:17] <duch_kazatel> hocza yeah, but put that jandler inside the doc ready
[12:17:21] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, Velveeta that shit is weird.
[12:17:29] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: nice, even know the history haha.
[12:17:57] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Are you from Philly?
[12:18:06] <MikeD_> near enough :)
[12:18:29] <hocza> duch_kazatel: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/ApBDb/10/
[12:18:31] <duch_kazatel> i'm from a place that has a weird quirk with the word almond - we don't pronounce it "Ahl-mond" or "Awl-mond", we pronounce it "Aaa-mond"
[12:18:31] <BillCriswell> Nice. I work in Philly. I'm from the burbs, though.
[12:18:36] <Velveeta> does the mike stand for money and the d is for diamonds?
[12:18:49] <duch_kazatel> hocza basically yes.
[12:18:50] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Sounds Canadian.
[12:19:22] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell our city is one of the hubs of almond production for the US>
[12:19:25] <hocza> duch_kazatel: Yup, but here comes the problem. Add a new task, click on the checkbox. Nothing happening.
[12:19:28] <MikeD_> haha, nope.  I'm not the guy from Mike Industries either
[12:19:58] <duch_kazatel> hocza right, because $('.checkbox').on("click", 'input', function() { is wrong.  $('ul').on("click", '.checkbox input', function() { is closer
[12:20:08] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ beastie boys reference?
[12:20:10] <hocza> hm okay
[12:20:16] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I was thinking Beastie Boys.
[12:20:55] <MikeD_> Velveeta's was a Beastie Boys reference
[12:21:08] <hocza> ohhhhhhhhhhh MR duch_kazatel ! thank you really really really, and really much! :)
[12:21:10] <Velveeta> :D
[12:21:14] <duch_kazatel> hocza understand now?
[12:21:23] <Velveeta> awwwww, now i haz a sad... we're coming up on the anniversary of mca's death
[12:21:27] <duch_kazatel> noooo
[12:21:29] <hocza> yes! :)
[12:21:34] <MikeD_> Apparently MikeD is the owner of Mike Industries, he blogs and tweets on tech stuff  (probably makes 3x my salary and works 1.2 as much)
[12:22:08] <hocza> with the $('ul') will have the event
[12:22:08] <MikeD_> I'm Yet-Another-MikeD
[12:22:26] <duch_kazatel> hocza right - you need to bind to something that exists on pageload.
[12:22:31] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Just looked at his site our of curiosity.. very nice, in the old styles.
[12:22:33] <hocza> and since I'm not adding another ul, it will functions no matter what... :)
[12:22:45] <duch_kazatel> hocza right.  you're not removing it or anything.
[12:22:48] <hocza> duch_kazatel: Thanks. I learnt so much today! :)
[12:23:23] <hocza> This knowledge definitely cuts my coding time in half... :)
[12:23:49] <duch_kazatel> hocza event delegation is one of my favorite things ever about javascript.
[12:23:51] <duch_kazatel> it's kind of sadf.
[12:23:53] <duch_kazatel> *sad
[12:25:16] <BillCriswell> What should I learn this weekend.
[12:25:37] <duch_kazatel> guitar
[12:25:44] <BillCriswell> I'd have to buy a guitar.
[12:25:45] <duch_kazatel> ooh or how to cook a steak.
[12:25:54] <BillCriswell> I'd have to buy a steak.
[12:26:08] <hocza> duch_kazatel: is it possible to delegate somehow event for change in an Object? like: var user = {id: 123, name: "John"}
[12:26:16] <hocza> a change*
[12:26:25] <duch_kazatel> hocza hrm?
[12:26:32] <duch_kazatel> hocza oh, no.
[12:26:37] <hocza> and when I fire: user.name = "Tom";
[12:26:55] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to use something like riot or backbone or a reactive programming library to get something like that.
[12:27:01] <BillCriswell> hocza: If you set up a custom getter and setter you could maybe.
[12:27:02] <hocza> then it should update my <span id="username">John</span>
[12:27:13] <hocza> oh i see
[12:27:21] <BillCriswell> hocza: Yeah, you want something with binding.
[12:27:23] <duch_kazatel> hocza yeah, you can't just watch objects like that.
[12:27:39] <duch_kazatel> you'd need an MV* framework or an RP/FRP framework.
[12:28:13] <hocza> oh I had so much pain with AngularJS. You could bet with my recent flash of my knowledge...
[12:28:14] <hocza> :D
[12:28:45] <duch_kazatel> angular is another optiopn, though i'm personally not a fan.  others like it though.
[12:29:39] <BillCriswell> I'm learning Angular and... the verdict is out. I'll blame my ignorance for the time being, though.
[12:29:48] <hocza> And I saw that meteor.js and ember.js can achieve the same that I want.
[12:30:05] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:30:08] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:30:11] <duch_kazatel> tons of choices out there.
[12:31:43] <BillCriswell> It requires a pretty serious change in the way you write things.
[12:31:43] <hocza> hm maybe I should go with angular :)
[12:32:03] <BillCriswell> Serious learning curve.
[12:32:18] <duch_kazatel> angular and backbone are the big two last i checked.
[12:33:04] <hocza> BillCriswell: where should I start?
[12:33:39] <hocza> i'm learning the node.js from basics, screencasts, etc. Maybe the same would be good for angular, at egghead.io or something like that.
[12:37:05] <BillCriswell> hocza: I went through the tutoral on the site.
[12:37:11] <BillCriswell> Then just messed around from there.

[12:50:27] <BillCriswell> Voyage: It listed a lot of tetragram and hexagram stuff.

[12:52:32] <ashgotti> Afternoon everyone. I'm using jquerymobileui and need a bit of help with Panels http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/panel/ I have implemented it without a problem but the click target for closing the panel (clicking outside of the panel) has an issue where it also includes about 20% of the panel. So if I click upto 20% in the panel, it closes. This is problematic because I have buttons that don't work when users click them because the panel closes
[12:52:40] <Voyage> BillCriswell,  nice! but no match
[12:54:21] <Voyage> BillCriswell,  Sorry, shapecatcher couldn't complete the request at the moment. (Error: Bad)
[12:54:36] <BillCriswell> Voyage: Haha never seen that error.

[13:03:43] <BillCriswell> Guess not ( if it's an array of jQuery objects? )
[13:04:04] <BillCriswell> No seems to work either wya.
[13:04:04] <decx> i probably only tried it with strings then
[13:04:12] <decx> hu
[13:04:17] <decx> well good to know

[13:05:02] <BillCriswell> Nope... still works.

[13:13:56] <BillCriswell> gnarf: http://tjvantoll.com/speaking/slides/jQuery-Defense/San-Diego/#/51 damn right
[13:14:22] <gnarf> BillCriswell: should watch the video - its a good one has some non-slide info too
[13:15:24] <BillCriswell> I'll check it out when I get home.
[13:22:30] <neurochrome> hey peeps, having trouble trying to get this to work... http://pastebin.com/kHWJwkbb
[13:23:08] <BillCriswell> neurochrome: Thinking first-child should be :first-child at first glance.
[13:23:18] <BillCriswell> If that doesn't solve your issue I can look al ittle closer.
[13:23:44] <neurochrome> BillCriswell, nice, I'll give that a try... was just writing out the issue, but if that solves it, then kudos you ninja you!
[13:24:35] <neurochrome> ah, nope! so, the idea is that dropdown-toggle is clicked and it toggles the child element visibility .dropdown-menu
[13:25:06] <decx> isnt bind deprecated?
[13:25:30] <neurochrome> there are multiple dropdown-toggles, and when you click one, it needs to hide all other .dropdown-toggle > .dropdown-menu's except the current one
[13:26:03] <neurochrome> decx, just stole this from an online tut... not seen any  mention of deprecated methods in the console
[13:26:29] <BillCriswell> neurochrome: Should be using .on(), but not super relative here.
[13:26:36] <BillCriswell> relevant*
[13:27:17] <neurochrome> just switched it, same as live() then!
[13:27:22] <neurochrome> gone the way of the dinosaur
[13:27:33] <BillCriswell> neurochrome: Maybe you just want e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[13:28:12] <neurochrome> so, any other ideas why when i click an already visible menu, that it fades out then toggles, when it should ignore the fade out if that not actually worked
[13:28:41] <neurochrome> BillCriswell, no joy, unfortunately
[13:28:54] <BillCriswell> Can you set up a real demo at jsbin.com? Plain text isn't too helpful here.
[13:29:39] <neurochrome> BillCriswell, give me a sec, heres the markup for the menu... http://pastebin.com/Eu9MSKjn
[13:29:48] <neurochrome> here's*
[13:31:36] <nhulea> yo I am trying to get these seperated into indiviual click events is there a way to do that with this code or should rename the selectors
[13:31:38] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/f4G7V/1/
[13:31:47] <nhulea> I was trying to interate through them
[13:31:56] <nhulea> but it just triggers everything
[13:33:08] <neurochrome> BillCriswell, http://jsbin.com/kerilaju/1/
[13:33:39] <neurochrome> ignore the fact that the submenu is visible before the first click
[13:33:51] <neurochrome> after the initial click, that is the actual behaviour
[13:35:48] <decx> nhulea http://jsfiddle.net/decx/f4G7V/2/
[13:36:06] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[13:36:11] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/f4G7V/3/ decx beat me.
[13:36:34] <decx> aaw sweet confirmed success thanks to version numbers
[13:37:11] <nhulea> cool thanks
[13:37:22] <decx> that's what you get for alwways adding $ to the vars BillCriswell
[13:37:42] <BillCriswell> decx: Shiiiiiiiiiiit.
[13:39:08] <BillCriswell> You know my shit's a jquery object!
[13:39:11] <BillCriswell> Hopefully.
[13:40:06] <nhulea> wow I have never heard of closest is that new
[13:40:30] <decx> i just don't like the visual of $ for vars
[13:40:35] <decx> it's pretty new yeah
[13:41:03] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, you're definitely not the only one.
[13:41:08] <BillCriswell> It doesn't bother me though.
[13:42:06] <nhulea> doest that do some sort of cache of the vars ?
[13:42:18] <decx> na it's just preference
[13:42:22] <BillCriswell> $ is just pure decoration.
[13:42:31] <neurochrome> BillCriswell, whoops, changed the not to on in that bin... http://jsbin.com/kerilaju/3/
[13:42:33] <decx> looks too much like php to me :>
[13:42:39] <BillCriswell> Cooler people tend to use it.
[13:42:57] <BillCriswell> and really, really good looking people.
[13:43:24] <nhulea> who judges whether people are cool or not ?
[13:43:28] <decx> go and praise your mighty mammon
[13:43:44] <neurochrome> Super rich people start their vars with $$$$
[13:43:45] <nhulea> NSA
[13:43:50] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Women.
[13:44:02] <nhulea> women work at the nsa too
[13:45:01] <nhulea> poor people start there variable with ¢
[13:45:12] <nhulea> *variables
[13:45:42] <BillCriswell> https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/547849_10151695883765741_951985595_n.jpg
[13:46:37] <neurochrome> BillCriswell, soooooo, anything spring to mind on that jsbin? <nudge nudge wink wink>
[13:46:38] <nhulea> http://www.alsacorp.com/alsa_film/economy_films/images/diamante/diamond_mercedes.jpg
[13:47:21] <BillCriswell> neurochrome: Your logic is messing with my brain.
[13:47:36] <BillCriswell> What do you want again?
[13:48:26] <neurochrome> click products, then click it again, it should fade and disappear (toggle), but instead it fades then toggles
[13:48:42] <neurochrome> the fade should be ignored, and only the toggle triggered
[13:48:53] <neurochrome> if you catch my drift
[13:50:30] <neurochrome> the $(".dropdown-menu").not(':first-child').fadeOut(); is supposed to fadeOut any other menus that are open, except the one you are possibly already accessing
[13:51:27] <neurochrome> the document click bind is used to hide all menus, should you not click a .dropdown-toggle element
[13:53:12] <BillCriswell> neurochrome: I'm sorry dude my brain is out for the day.
[13:53:23] <neurochrome> BillCriswell, no sweat! ;)
[13:53:56] <BillCriswell> neurochrome: What's the point of the not fadeout?
[13:54:14] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/kerilaju/5/edit?js,output should this be ok?
[13:55:41] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/u6d5B/
[13:55:46] <decx> neurochrome ^
[13:55:49] <neurochrome> If I have menu1 open and click menu2 I need menu1 to fadeOut, but to toggle menu2, they both share the same class, so I need to select all menus based on that class, but ignore the menu2
[13:55:54] <neurochrome> cheers
[13:56:51] <neurochrome> BillCriswell, that has the potential for both menus to be open, which I want to avoid
[13:57:20] <neurochrome> decx, that stops the user from closing the menu via a toggle
[13:57:34] <BillCriswell> I'm headed home. Later!
[13:57:41] <neurochrome> o/ in a bit!
[13:57:48] <neurochrome> it's the weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekend!
[13:57:55] <neurochrome> and I'm sat coding
[14:00:32] <decx> easy enough http://jsfiddle.net/decx/u6d5B/1/
[14:01:14] <decx> oh missed bill
[14:01:21] <neurochrome> decx, legend... SOMEONE BUY THIS MAN A BEER!
[14:03:13] <neurochrome> thank you!
[14:03:36] <decx> traverse that dom like a ninja
[14:04:48] <neurochrome> decx, why the return false? That makes a big difference!
[14:06:13] <decx> just a reflex, substitue with a propagation of your choice
[14:18:46] <jimggg> this is a rather vague question coming from a newbie, as I don't even know how to google search the question. I have a button when you click it will trigger an ajax call which takes a few seconds to complete. I want something that tells the user to wait and fade out when the ajax call is finished. What should I be looking for?
[14:19:39] <duch_kazatel> you want an ajax loading icon.
[14:19:54] <duch_kazatel> well, not necessarily.
[14:20:04] <jimggg> ahh, thank you, at least I got something to google for.
[14:20:05] <duch_kazatel> check out the beforesend and done callbacks for ajax.
[14:20:13] <jimggg> ok will do.
[14:20:21] <jlee1201> you want to learn about callbacks or promises / deferreds
[14:20:21] <brunoais> jimggg, what you want is simple
[14:20:31] <brunoais> just place somthing in the page beforehand
[14:20:45] <brunoais> then make it appear in the code after where you make the ajax call
[14:20:57] <brunoais> then, when it completes, you make it disappear (display:none)
[14:20:59] <duch_kazatel> add/remove classes to a thing.
[14:21:37] <jimggg> will research all above, thank you folks
[14:21:53] <brunoais> jimggg, search for the complete callback here: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:21:56] <motaka2> how can I add an element to one to last ?
[14:22:08] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, yeah, that's a better option
[14:22:21] <brunoais> but it's better to mention what the CSS is about ^^
[14:22:22] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 huh?
[14:22:26] <brunoais> *the CSS associated
[14:22:50] <brunoais> motaka2, you mean to add an element to before the last element in a list of elements?
[14:23:07] <motaka2> brunoais: yes
[14:23:21] <brunoais> motaka2, I dunno the jQuery API well enough for that :S
[14:23:28] <brunoais> I dunno the name of th methods
[14:23:40] <brunoais> in the browser API it's something like
[14:23:55] <motaka2> brunoais: thx at least now I can use the right english phrase to express myself
[14:24:05] <brunoais> container.insertBefore(newElem, container.lastElementChild);
[14:24:17] <hxm> hello I have a form in the page and I use the selector $("form") for detect it, doesnt works, is it wrong method?
[14:24:52] <brunoais> hxm, using that selector, you are searching for all tags called "form" in the page
[14:25:09] <hxm> yes, there should be 2 forms and I use $(this) for handle them
[14:25:17] <hxm> bad idea?
[14:25:19] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ hxm
[14:25:20] <b-ot> hxm: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:25:40] <brunoais> hxm, here's some explanation about selectors
[14:25:41] <brunoais> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors
[14:25:56] <brunoais> it's more like the actual definition of them, the table gives a good summary
[14:26:04] <brunoais> hxm, usually, yes
[14:26:22] <hxm> hm better adding a class?
[14:26:24] <brunoais> if another form appears in the page, it will then also include it in the set, which you probably do not want
[14:26:42] <brunoais> if you want to select a specific element in the DOM, you better use, for example, an ID
[14:26:46] <duch_kazatel> hxm i'd share your code so we get a better idea of what you're trying to do.
[14:26:47] <brunoais> hxm, ^
[14:27:00] <duch_kazatel> because it's hard to help without knowing what you're doing.
[14:27:09] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, not really
[14:27:32] <brunoais> searching for a tag in the DOM document is generally a bad idea
[14:27:35] <monstordh> I'm trying to do something that should be simple. I have an unordered list generated by my shopping cart and I need to give each list item a unique ID. However, I'm not getting anywhere. Can someone point me in the right direction, please?
[14:27:46] <brunoais> you better search by id, class or a data-tag
[14:27:53] <brunoais> *data-* attribute
[14:27:57] <duch_kazatel> i disagree - his question is vague, and tossing out the w3 spec sheet for css selectors is unhelpful.  perhaps he's using event bindings and he's handling the proper form through $(this)
[14:28:11] <brunoais> monstordh, think wisely
[14:28:11] <duch_kazatel> never select using data attributes if you can stand it.
[14:28:21] <brunoais> unique ids like that are usually not what you want
[14:28:29] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, why?
[14:28:34] <monstordh> then what do I want?
[14:28:47] <duch_kazatel> brunoais because they're slow.
[14:28:48] <hxm> http://jsfiddle.net/NUVxP/
[14:28:51] <monstordh> I need them to have id's such as "menu-item-1" etc.
[14:28:52] <duch_kazatel> and not meant for selecting.
[14:28:52] <brunoais> monstordh, that depends on your situation
[14:29:07] <hxm> the result of that ajax will show a button that says "test this" with another form
[14:29:09] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, that's why I cache the nodes or I search in a subset of the DOM, not all document
[14:29:31] <duch_kazatel> brunoais it's still very slow to run that initial select.
[14:29:32] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, as long as you don't keep searching for them, it's fine
[14:29:50] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, about 1.5x the time it takes to search by tagname
[14:29:52] <duch_kazatel> i disagree.
[14:29:57] <brunoais> nothing special
[14:30:23] <brunoais> searching by class is about the same speed as searching by any other attibute
[14:30:32] <duch_kazatel> have proof for that?
[14:30:33] <brunoais> not the same, class is faster
[14:30:37] <brunoais> jsperf ;)
[14:30:41] <duch_kazatel> link?
[14:30:50] <duch_kazatel> because data attributes are not meant for selecting and are generally very slow.
[14:30:50] * brunoais searching...
[14:32:39] <monstordh> brunoais: And how do I determine "my situation"?
[14:32:40] <duch_kazatel> select off the id you have on the form all ready.
[14:33:10] <duch_kazatel> monstordh what are you doing again?
[14:33:12] <brunoais> monstordh, that depends more on the context. How you are going to use that cart, for example
[14:33:29] <brunoais> are you just displaying info?
[14:33:38] <brunoais> do you need to search for those elements in the list?
[14:33:47] <monstordh> yes - I just need to be able to grab a list item and style it individually
[14:33:57] <brunoais> why not use CSS for that?
[14:34:07] <brunoais> apply classes and have CSS do its job
[14:34:10] <monstordh> yes to the "only display info"
[14:34:18] <brunoais> if needed, add dynamically stylesheets to the DOM
[14:34:20] <monstordh> that's my whole point - I can't uniquely identify them
[14:34:35] <brunoais> why do you need to identify uniquely?
[14:34:53] <monstordh> as I said, I need to be able to grab a list item and style it individually
[14:35:03] <duch_kazatel> monstordh you can also use .eq()
[14:35:10] <monstordh> what's that?
[14:35:12] <duch_kazatel> $('li').eq('2') for the third in that array.
[14:36:19] <monstordh> ah
[14:36:23] <monstordh> nice
[14:36:31] <monstordh> ok - I might just give that a shot
[14:36:32] <monstordh> thanks!
[14:36:34] <duch_kazatel> what specifically are you trying to grab again?
[14:37:08] <monstordh> a single list item and set css properties for it
[14:37:23] <monstordh> but I will be styling each one uniquely
[14:37:38] <duch_kazatel> like procedurally?
[14:37:53] <monstordh> I'm not a programmer. I'm a hack. What do you mean?
[14:38:05] <duch_kazatel> what criteria are you using to style each one?
[14:38:17] <monstordh> let me give you a visual
[14:38:49] <monstordh> here's the page I'm working on http://www.siglermusiconline.com/store/pc/home.asp
[14:39:04] <monstordh> I need to style those menu items to look something similar to the ones here:
[14:39:29] <monstordh> http://www.bestbuy.com/ (under Products > TV & Home Theater)
[14:39:51] <duch_kazatel> okay - what does that have to do with unique IDs?
[14:42:03] <duch_kazatel> because nothing in there requires anything special.
[14:42:22] <monstordh> How else would I style an individual list item? Now that you've taught me about eq(), I know
[14:42:39] <duch_kazatel> nothing in the best buy example requires you to do that.
[14:43:16] <duch_kazatel> if you have special things you want to target, you should really generate your uniquely identifying information in your backend, not your frontend.
[14:43:23] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-selector-performance
[14:43:45] <brunoais> the only one actually fast is by id
[14:44:06] <brunoais> class vs data-* attribute difference is quite small
[14:44:12] <monstordh> duch_kazatel: lol. I totally understand that, but I don't have any control over that.
[14:44:19] <monstordh> hence the jq :)
[14:44:24] <duch_kazatel> monstordh why not?
[14:44:46] <duch_kazatel> brunoais http://jsperf.com/class-vs-data-test
[14:45:08] <monstordh> because I can't mess with core. i'm just a hireling
[14:45:19] <duch_kazatel> monstordh that... is worrying, but okay.
[14:45:21] <monstordh> and… Like I said, I'm NOT a programmer :)
[14:45:27] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, not valid
[14:45:36] <duch_kazatel> brunoais huh?
[14:45:42] <brunoais> you don't see what else jQuery is doing behind that
[14:46:00] <brunoais> besides
[14:46:01] <duch_kazatel> brunoais the context of jquery was assumed on my behalf.
[14:46:05] <brunoais> all elements will be gathered
[14:46:10] <brunoais> you need to use it to filter
[14:46:15] <duch_kazatel> and either way, data attributes are intended to store data.
[14:46:20] <monstordh> duch_kazatel & brunoais - thanks for the help!
[14:46:28] <brunoais> monstordh, you are welcome
[14:46:31] <duch_kazatel> of course!
[14:51:40] <duch_kazatel> sooo ready for work beer today
[14:51:46] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-selector-performance
[14:51:48] <brunoais> better?
[14:52:23] <brunoais> Anyhow, I always do the search in a subset of the DPM
[14:52:25] <brunoais> *DOM
[14:52:31] <brunoais> not all the document
[14:52:44] <brunoais> and I cache the results
[14:52:45] <duch_kazatel> sure, which is smart, but searching on data attributes is really counter-intuitive imo.
[14:53:30] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, class is for CSS, id is for unique DOM element, data-* attribute is for js
[14:53:38] <duch_kazatel> no
[14:53:40] <duch_kazatel> i disagree 100%
[14:53:44] <brunoais> using class for js is a small puzzle
[14:54:06] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, what's your opinion?
[14:55:06] <duch_kazatel> class to link together collections of elements based on a variety of criteria (font size, validation, whatever), ID for things that must be uniquely identified.  data for storing information on a DOM node.
[14:57:00] <duch_kazatel> classes are not "for css" imo.
[14:57:58] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, the main issue is when I have a class that is used by CSS and js to search in the DOM to apply stuff
[14:58:17] <brunoais> if the class has to be changed or if it is changed... maze horay
[14:58:27] <duch_kazatel> then you should be writing more modular code imo.
[14:59:39] <duch_kazatel> selecting on something intended for data storage is not a good solution to that problem.
[15:10:27] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, that's how data-* attributes help ^^
[15:10:56] <duch_kazatel> i disagree.
[15:11:07] <duch_kazatel> then you are munging data into your logic.
[15:11:10] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li4Y0E_x8zE
[15:11:16] <brunoais> he's a good js dev
[15:11:21] <brunoais> he talks sense
[15:11:34] <duch_kazatel> okay?  why am i watching an hour long talk now?
[15:11:42] <Kamuela> Is a promise an object returned by a method?
[15:12:17] <brunoais> Kamuela, no
[15:12:31] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, he talks how to make good use of js
[15:12:43] <brunoais> I don't agree with every single thing he mentions
[15:12:50] <brunoais> but for most of it, I do
[15:12:58] <duch_kazatel> brunoais okay?  i still disagree with your stance that you should ever use data attributes for selecting notes.
[15:13:00] <duch_kazatel> *nodes
[15:13:17] <blindMoe> seems weird to select on  a data attribute
[15:13:17] <brunoais> meh... it's ok
[15:13:25] <blindMoe> doesn't really matter though.. personal preference
[15:13:37] <brunoais> as long as you do it right or you actually know what you are doing
[15:13:41] <duch_kazatel> at my company, your code would likely get rejected for doing that.
[15:13:50] <decx> oh we're watching hour long talks now?
[15:13:52] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, really?
[15:13:57] <duch_kazatel> brunoais yes.
[15:13:59] <brunoais> decx, if you accept?
[15:14:02] <decx> http://vimeo.com/36579366 good talk
[15:14:03] <brunoais> *...
[15:14:10] <blindMoe> decx: I'll bring the pizza.. you bring the beer
[15:14:24] <brunoais> decx, wishlisted
[15:14:29] <brunoais> I'll watch it later
[16:01:25] <StephenS> I have an issue with ajax, when I hit Load more button, it calls data from extern.php with javascript/jquery code, however it does not work when I append(data), why?
[16:01:36] <StephenS> I use .html() and not .load
[16:02:05] <StephenS> success: function(html){
[16:02:05] <StephenS> $("#updates").append(html);
[16:02:23] <StephenS> blah
[16:02:33] <StephenS> solved, I switched to the .load method.
[16:05:40] <StephenS> actually its not solved -.-
[16:07:17] <StephenS> am I missing something?
[16:10:15] <StephenS> any hint anything?
[16:42:15] <JamesG1990> Hi, any idea how I can make this take place when you press submit? Right now alls I could do was get it to tell it to me in an alert....

[16:43:22] <shiftins> anyone familiar with select2 and the tags option?
[16:43:57] <shiftins> I'm trying to determine if an item added is already in the tags array of if it's a new item.. does select2 append this nuance to any events?
[16:44:16] <duch_workbeer> JamesG1990 look up .on()
[16:48:12] <JamesG1990> dutch_workbeer ok so I should use .on() and then the click event, but how do it get it to go to the address....I was just using the alert to test if it actually worked
[16:50:10] <JamesG1990> duch_workbeer*^
[16:53:50] <relipse> I have a <td><img></td>... in the middle of a table, given the img, how do i find the left td, the top td, the right td and the bottom td
[16:54:03] <relipse> someone answered me before but I lost it
[16:54:17] <relipse> shiftin: i love select2
[16:54:20] <relipse> shiftins:
[16:54:34] <relipse> never dealt with tags though
[16:54:46] <phelix> Anyone in here ever heard or used isotope before? http://isotope.metafizzy.co/ ?
[16:57:09] <relipse> not me
[17:00:25] <duch_workbeer> JamesG1990 sorry was off being funny - window.location iirc.
[17:07:37] <JamesG1990> duch_workbeer like this? http://hastebin.com/sifemacewa.php (obviously it doesnt work...yet)
[17:10:00] <erming> JamesG1990: don't use $("button").on("click"), but rather $("form").on("submit", ...)
[17:10:40] <relipse> How can i find the TD ABOVE my current TD
[17:10:46] <relipse> and below for that matter
[17:11:00] <erming> JamesG1990: http://hastebin.com/acumusebof.xml
[17:11:01] <relipse> i was thinking $td.closest('tr').previous()
[17:11:05] <duch_workbeer> JamesG1990 http://jsfiddle.net/73UdY/1/
[17:11:07] <relipse> but .....
[17:11:16] <duch_workbeer> it's a value not a function.
[17:11:26] <erming> relipse: think it's .prev()
[17:11:35] <relipse> previous worked
[17:11:40] <erming> kk
[17:11:50] <relipse> but may be shortened thanks
[17:11:57] <relipse> but anyway
[17:12:11] <relipse> i have a big table like a grid system and i want to find the td right below
[17:13:00] <erming> do you have any kind of control over the HTML outputted?
[17:13:00] <duch_workbeer> relipse you need to get the current td's index, go to the previous tr, and find the td with that same index.
[17:13:09] <relipse> yeah exactly
[17:13:12] <relipse> thanks
[17:13:13] <erming> "outputted".. wtf, does that word even exist
[17:13:14] <decx> arent all tables a grid?
[17:13:31] <duch_workbeer> not necessarily.
[17:13:39] <erming> decx: colspan etc
[17:13:52] <relipse> i'm trying to make a game
[17:13:59] <relipse> and i last made a game 12 years ago
[17:14:01] <relipse> lol
[17:14:09] <erming> relipse: i would generate x&y for each cell
[17:14:14] <erming> like
[17:14:18] <relipse> naa much cooler to use all jquery
[17:14:18] <decx> a game with a table?
[17:14:21] <relipse> lol
[17:14:39] <erming> <tr data-y="1"><td data-x="1"></td><td data-x="2"></td></tr>
[17:15:00] <erming> $td.data("x") // get x position
[17:15:06] <relipse> i know right its gotta be a stupid idea but yes a game with a table as the grid
[17:15:06] <erming> yada yada
[17:15:23] <erming> i'd say go for it :>
[17:15:25] <relipse> how else am I supposed to do it?
[17:15:33] <decx> depends on the game eh :D
[17:15:39] <duch_workbeer> yeah if you can generate positional data on each of those TDs from the server that's probably smarter
[17:15:42] <relipse> i'm trying to recreate bomberman
[17:15:42] <erming> relipse, well, if you're able to add these kinds of values when you generate the HTML
[17:15:53] <relipse> no server side language right now
[17:16:01] <decx> don't use tables
[17:16:02] <erming> you could do it on document ready too
[17:16:10] <relipse> why not decx
[17:16:10] <duch_workbeer> how are you generating the table in the first place then?
[17:16:17] <relipse> i typed it out
[17:16:23] <duch_workbeer> then add in the data manually.
[17:16:26] <erming> $("tr").each(function(i) { $(this).data("y", i); });
[17:16:42] <erming> and nested to do the same with the td's
[17:16:44] <decx> because you want to have a free game space where you can position elements on
[17:16:57] <relipse> you can position them on a table
[17:17:00] <relipse> using absolute
[17:17:16] <relipse> yeah i was kind of running into troubles but i like showing the map as a table it seems
[17:17:17] <relipse> hmm
[17:17:53] <JamesG1990> duch_workbeer thank you, but I can't seem to get it working on my local install :(
[17:18:05] <duch_workbeer> JamesG1990 what does your console say?
[17:18:34] <JamesG1990> duch_workbeer just 1 unrelated warning
[17:18:41] <duch_workbeer> and that is?
[17:18:44] <JamesG1990> event.returnValue is deprecated
[17:18:54] <JamesG1990> unless it is related..
[17:20:01] <duch_workbeer> does that happen when you hit the button?
[17:20:31] <erming> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/Xpn66/1/
[17:20:36] <duch_workbeer> because it shouldn't matter.
[17:21:00] <JamesG1990> i think its unrelated because I have other jquery on my page too
[17:21:10] <decx> nice erming
[17:21:13] <erming> i'm just using .html(y + "," + x); in this case, but you could use this loop to make something more out of it
[17:21:18] <relipse> erming: cool idea
[17:21:23] <relipse> thanks
[17:22:23] <duch_workbeer> JamesG1990 http://jsfiddle.net/73UdY/3/
[17:22:25] <decx> if there's a game in a table i want to see it
[17:22:31] <duch_workbeer> try using the form submit event instead.
[17:22:44] <relipse> decx: i will show you what i got as soon as I get it showable
[17:23:36] <decx> yesterday i would have said forget it, html markup games are trash. but i built something myself today and it's surprisingly effective
[17:26:34] <erming> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/Xpn66/3/
[17:26:38] <erming> just me playing around with data-attributes
[17:28:25] <erming> time to hit the sack.. nighty guys
[17:28:31] <relipse> gnight
[17:28:34] <JamesG1990> duch_workbeer ehh its not working, not sure what is wrong...oh well
[17:28:34] <relipse> talk to you later
[17:28:41] <relipse> decx can i see your html games?
[17:29:14] <duch_workbeer> JamesG1990 you aren't ajaxing in the form, right?
[17:29:22] <JamesG1990> no
[17:29:39] <duch_workbeer> i'd need to see the page then
[17:30:15] <duch_workbeer> and with that, i exit.  enjoy.
[17:30:20] <JamesG1990> can I pm you the link...i have it on a live dev site
[17:30:28] <JamesG1990> or not
[17:31:03] <decx> relipse this is with html markup: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Sg77m/24/show/ these are canvas: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/rbpsv/16/show http://jsfiddle.net/decx/huKnN/show/
[17:31:40] <relipse> crap
[17:31:46] <relipse> yeah thats way above my league man
[17:31:55] <relipse> you want to help me recreate bomberman
[17:33:37] <decx> check the code, i comment throughout. just take the show away from the url to see and change code. i'm a gamedev beginner myself but the first steps can be impressive on first sight ;)
[17:34:17] <decx> then comes a real game dev and spits in your face for committing code atrocities ^^
[17:37:17] <relipse> have you seen bombermine.com
[17:37:39] <relipse> i like the idea but i wnat to do a bomberman myself
[17:38:27] <decx> oh i forgot about that
[17:38:41] <decx> good thing or else my productivity would be 0
[17:38:53] <lethjakman> is there a way to watch and see if something is added to the page, and if so execute some code?
[17:52:13] <StephenS> I have issue when doing append(data) to html div tag on page, loading spin is showed, but my page stucks on 2 secs when data is added to div.
[17:52:32] <StephenS> It's massive data, so that might be an issue? I add javascript and such.. any way to speed it up?
[17:53:24] <zylophone> uhm, what does ~$('#foo').removeClass("bar"); mean? specifically the tilde?
[18:00:56] <decx> zylophone it inverts the bits, whatever that means in this context
[18:06:40] <shoky> what's the context, zylophone ?
[18:07:26] <shoky> can't think of any where that'd be useful to do
[18:07:40] <shoky> as .removeClass returns the jquery object
[18:26:19] <Taggnostr2> hello
[18:26:41] <Taggnostr2> is this the right place where to ask questions about datatables?
[18:34:43] <zylophone> if .find('.bar') == $('.foo').children('.bar') ?
[18:35:11] <zylophone> s/if/is
[18:35:48] <jacobroufa> not necessarily
[18:36:00] <jacobroufa> children only travels down one level. find will go the whole way.
[18:36:29] <jacobroufa> http://api.jquery.com/children/
[18:37:07] <jacobroufa> sorry, zylophone, this ^^ was for you
[18:37:19] <jacobroufa> Taggnostr2 just ask your question. dunno til you ask. :)
[18:37:48] <zylophone> oh, i thought children would recurse all children
[18:38:08] <Taggnostr2> jacobroufa: http://next.datatables.net/reference/option/ajax#Examples <- I'm following the third example but it doesn't send out the request for the json file
[18:38:15] <Taggnostr2> my code is here: http://wolfprojects.altervista.org/patches.html
[18:38:27] <zylophone> Taggnostr2: thanks. that would be a bit of a gotcha for me at some point!
[18:38:59] <Taggnostr2> afaik that should send a request for the patches.json file, but from the inspector I don't see any request
[18:40:11] <Taggnostr2> I'm probably missing something trivial, or maybe I misunderstood the docs
[18:46:26] <jacobroufa> Taggnostr2: if you set your "dataSrc" to be a function like the second to last example on your first link, what does the json log out to?
[18:47:11] <Taggnostr2> jacobroufa, it doesn't even send out the request for the json file, I tried even with "ajax": "patches.json" directly
[18:47:24] <Taggnostr2> but from the inspector I don't see any request when I reload the page
[18:48:24] <jacobroufa> youre loading in your dataTables.css as a script :p
[18:48:38] <Taggnostr2> oops
[18:48:50] <jacobroufa> i wonder if that has anything to do with it haha
[18:51:34] <Taggnostr2> jacobroufa, looks like it doesn't, but thanks for spotting that
[18:55:56] <jacobroufa> what if you just set "ajax": "patches.json"?
[18:56:01] <jacobroufa> does it send out the request then?
[18:56:26] <Taggnostr2> it didn't before, I can try again
[18:56:38] <jacobroufa> thats weird. i wonder why it doesnt do that.
[18:57:21] <Delizin> Is there something special you need to do to refresh variables in functions? In here http://dpaste.com/1797705/ I am trying to adjust a parameter I send in an ajax request based on the current value of a select element, but it only sends the original value at page load.
[18:58:01] <Taggnostr2> jacobroufa, still nothing
[18:59:04] <jacobroufa> and as a function?
[19:04:29] <Taggnostr2> jacobroufa, the function is not called
[19:07:44] <jacobroufa> https://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/ajax.html
[19:08:06] <jacobroufa> "sAjaxSource": "patches.json" instead of "ajax"?
[19:09:05] <Taggnostr2> bingo \o/
[19:09:09] <jacobroufa> :)
[19:09:19] <jacobroufa> where did you find the documentation on "ajax" first?
[19:09:51] <jacobroufa> going from their site -> examples -> "data sources" section ajax is prominently featured
[19:10:06] <jacobroufa> and other ajax related links say to use "sAjaxSource" as well
[19:12:26] <Taggnostr2> http://next.datatables.net/examples/ajax/simple.html
[19:13:56] <jacobroufa> next.datatables.net… odd.
[19:14:25] <jacobroufa> ahhhh
[19:14:34] <jacobroufa> so, thats documentation for 1.10, which is in beta
[19:14:46] <jacobroufa> hence the api change to use "ajax" instead of "sAjaxSource"
[19:14:55] <jacobroufa> youre using 1.9.4
[19:16:13] <Taggnostr2> uhm, I was using that first, but then since it wasn't working I tried with 1.9.4
[19:16:29] <Taggnostr2> anyway, thanks for the help, now I'll see if I can get it to display my data :)
[19:19:13] <zylophone> uhm, hasData is a valid jquery function no? $('#foo').hasData is telling me it isn't a function
[19:22:33] <jacobroufa> Taggnostr2: :)
[19:23:01] <sahbeewah_> zylophone: $.hasData(element)
[19:23:02] <jacobroufa> zylophone: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.hasData/
[19:23:36] <acidjazz> has datas
[19:23:39] <acidjazz> do you as the datas
[19:24:31] <jacobroufa> lol
[19:42:20] <Taggnostr2> jacobroufa, I went back to 1.10.0 and now the table works, thanks again!
[19:42:47] <jacobroufa> Taggnostr2: glad you got it working. :)
[20:11:23] <Taggnostr2> I have an array of bools that indicate if some things are available or not.  If I put these things in an array of strings, is there a simple way to pick only the ones that have a corresponding true? e.g. [true, false, true, false] and ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] should give me ['a', 'c']
[20:19:37] <Taggnostr2> $([true, false, true, false]).each(function (index, elem) { if (elem) alert(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'][index]); });
[20:19:41] <Taggnostr2> something like this maybe?
[20:20:34] <sahbeewah_> Taggnostr2: $.grep(arrayOfElements, function(el, index) { return arrayOfBools[index]; });
[20:23:03] <Taggnostr2> sahbeewah_, nice, thanks
[20:52:42] <Taggnostr2> I'm getting "TypeError: $(...).each(...).join is not a function", how can I use join there (or something equivalent)?
[20:53:02] <duch_kazatel> what is each returning?
[20:53:23] <Taggnostr2> fwiw I have an array of values, in the each I'm converting them to links and returning strings that I want to join with a <br>
[20:53:41] <duch_kazatel> Taggnostr2 mind sharing your code in a fiddle?
[20:54:49] <Taggnostr2> $(['foo', 'bar', 'baz']).each(function(index, elem) {return '<a>' + elem + '</a>';}).join('<br>');
[20:55:06] <Taggnostr2> (is there a jseval bot here?)
[20:55:24] <b1lly1> why
[20:55:41] <duch_kazatel> there isn't a jseval bot.
[20:56:02] <duch_kazatel> but that's not how you do what you want.
[20:56:04] <b1lly1> ya
[20:56:10] <b1lly1> that's going to short circuit your loop
[20:57:02] <duch_kazatel> you're not returning an array for your each, so you can't .join is.
[20:57:07] <duch_kazatel> *it
[20:57:11] <Taggnostr2> so how should I do it?  expected result is <a>foo</a><br><a>bar</a><br><a>baz</a>
[20:57:46] <duch_kazatel> can you put them into another element?
[20:57:50] <Taggnostr2> duch_kazatel, the idea is that each would return an array/iterable of strings (<a>...</a>) and the join would put them together, but apparently that's not how it works :)
[20:57:55] <b1lly1> var links = [];   $(['foo', 'bar', 'baz']).each(function(i, elem) { links.push('<a>' + elem + '</a>'); }); links.join('<br>')
[20:58:13] <duch_kazatel> b1lly1 has one way.
[20:58:20] <Taggnostr2> duch_kazatel, this code is in $(...).html()
[20:58:31] <duch_kazatel> Taggnostr2 look at what b1lly1 just gave you.
[20:58:34] <Taggnostr2> yep, what b1lly1 seems ok if there's no better way
[20:59:17] <duch_kazatel> don't use each() if you can avoid it btw :)
[20:59:38] <b1lly1> i mean, this is the jquery channel ^_^
[20:59:42] <b1lly1> so I gave a jquery solution ^_^
[21:00:04] <Taggnostr2> indeed I could use a for/in here
[21:00:15] <duch_kazatel> just a normal for loop.
[21:00:17] <duch_kazatel> not a for in.
[21:00:30] <duch_kazatel> the jquery each() is totally unnecessary (and much slower) for this case.
[21:00:55] <Taggnostr2> why not a for/in?
[21:01:23] <duch_kazatel> that's for objects.  arrays are technically objects, but a normal for is faster.
[21:01:35] <b1lly1> for/in is just slow
[21:01:48] <b1lly1> inheritly slow
[21:01:49] <duch_kazatel> for/in is still faster than an each() :)
[21:02:09] <duch_kazatel> normal for loops are great because you're giving it the number to enumerate with.
[21:02:35] <Taggnostr2> ok
[21:02:40] * Taggnostr2 is used to python
[21:02:45] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[21:02:52] <duch_kazatel> i remember that transition.
[21:02:59] <duch_kazatel> javascript is a little different.
[21:03:17] <duch_kazatel> you'll notice that there are no dictionaries or associative arrays or anything like that.
[21:03:57] <Taggnostr2> so something like this http://jsfiddle.net/n63uu/ ?
[21:04:19] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[21:04:30] <duch_kazatel> btw use console.log() instead: http://jsfiddle.net/n63uu/2/
[21:05:23] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/n63uu/4/
[21:05:47] <duch_kazatel> you were missing some semicolons at the beginning, and if you want maximum performance, cache you array length.
[21:06:06] <Taggnostr2> yep, I was too lazy to open the console
[21:06:13] <Taggnostr2> and nice trick the length caching
[21:06:45] <Taggnostr2> is there any strict rule about semicolons?
[21:06:49] <duch_kazatel> tons :)
[21:06:51] <b1lly1> use them
[21:06:56] <duch_kazatel> always at the end of statements.
[21:07:07] <Taggnostr2> js seems to do quite well even when I miss them, even though I try to use them
[21:07:14] <b1lly1> it will
[21:07:15] <duch_kazatel> there's a thing known as ASI, which saves you when you forget usually, but use them always anyway.
[21:07:20] <b1lly1> its best practice to use them
[21:07:30] <duch_kazatel> b1lly1 there are many that disagree with that.
[21:07:54] <b1lly1> do you?
[21:08:11] <duch_kazatel> not in the slightest - ASI is there to protect you.
[21:08:21] <duch_kazatel> don't rely on it though.
[21:08:23] <b1lly1> so then why argue :P
[21:08:35] <duch_kazatel> because it's inaccurate to say it's "best practice" in general
[21:08:42] <b1lly1> that's not true
[21:08:51] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of js devs that don't use them and argue very intelligently that point.
[21:09:01] <relipse> ooops previous didnt work
[21:09:03] <relipse> it was .prev()
[21:09:15] <b1lly1> and?
[21:09:17] <b1lly1> the point is?
[21:09:25] <duch_kazatel> not everybody would agree that it's "best practice"
[21:10:20] <b1lly1> anything in the web world is argumentative
[21:10:24] <duch_kazatel> i prefer to let people draw their own conclusions about that one.
[21:10:30] <b1lly1> is it only best practice if google claims it to be?
[21:10:40] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[21:11:04] <b1lly1> https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml#Semicolons
[21:11:57] <duch_kazatel> sure - some people disagree.
[21:12:17] <b1lly1> again, this is the web
[21:12:22] <b1lly1> there's always going to be people to disagree
[21:12:29] <Taggnostr2> if this ASI works and there aren't weird corner cases where it fails, I don't see why they should be added every time
[21:12:49] <Taggnostr2> but I don't know enough about it to decide to stop using them
[21:13:05] <duch_kazatel> Taggnostr2 and that's almost precisely the argument anti-semicolon folks use :)
[21:13:17] <duch_kazatel> the ecmascript spec is very clear about the rules.
[21:13:44] <duch_kazatel> just know that, like optional curlies, many people prefer to use them, and there are definitely are some corner cases where they fail.
[21:14:34] <duch_kazatel> ben_alman had a good article about this last year: http://benalman.com/news/2013/01/advice-javascript-semicolon-haters/
[21:14:54] <Taggnostr2> uhm, if the specs says they are mandatory, then I probably shouldn't rely on ASI
[21:15:31] <Taggnostr2> anyway, my page seems to work well enough now, thanks for helping me!
[21:15:36] <tandroid> Hey, I'm trying to do a simple ajax request to an api, but apparently I'm doing it all wrong. Because I get this error in the dev tools console: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
[21:15:52] <duch_kazatel> tandroid the server has to allow ajax.
[21:15:54] <tandroid> Here is my example: http://jsbin.com/xoney/1/edit?js,console
[21:16:44] <duch_kazatel> Taggnostr2 actually... www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf - feel free to see where is says "semicolons must be used" ;)
[21:16:56] <tandroid> In there docs they have an http get api. is that not the same? http://www.chartlyrics.com/api.aspx
[21:17:00] <tandroid> *their
[21:18:12] <duch_kazatel> works for me...
[21:18:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Nz8N6/f
[21:18:36] <duch_kazatel> wait nvm.
[21:18:53] <duch_kazatel> getting an xml parsing error.
[21:21:19] <tandroid> Yeah...
[21:21:35] <duch_kazatel> either way tandroid get != ajax.
[21:22:10] <tandroid> Right, I just figured it wouldn't matter
[21:22:16] <duch_kazatel> it does.
[21:22:25] <tandroid> Well now I know
[21:22:26] <duch_kazatel> the remote server must allow ajax.
[21:23:01] <tandroid> Is partly why you need an api key for most api's?
[21:23:06] <tandroid> security?
[21:23:12] <duch_kazatel> CSRF, yep
[21:23:18] <duch_kazatel> err, CORS
[21:23:24] <duch_kazatel> cross-origin resource sharing.
[21:24:02] <tandroid> Hmm yeah it makes sense.
[21:25:02] <tandroid> Well, I guess I don't really need this part to be all ajaxy anyway.
[21:25:13] <tandroid> Thanks for your help duch_kazatel
[21:25:26] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[23:30:26] <tegowai> hi,everyone... silly questions allowed in here?
[23:30:42] <prtksxna> tegowai: no question is silly
[23:31:11] <tegowai> if i started to learn jquery,should i learn json simultaneously?
[23:31:37] <systemfault> tegowai: You first need to learn a bit of JavaScript.
[23:31:41] <tegowai> and what is the difference between them? Google search didn't give answer
[23:31:58] <tegowai> i can program javascript basics
[23:32:00] <prtksxna> tegowai: learning Javascript will make the difference clear
[23:32:14] <tegowai> the core idea of both is similar?
[23:32:21] <systemfault> tegowai: jQuery is a library that makes it easier to work with the DOM. JSON is a serialization format.
[23:32:26] <tegowai> getting easy work with bunch of effects?
[23:32:59] <systemfault> tegowai: JSON is a way to “save” a JavaScript datastructure to a “string” so it can be sent/stored somewhere.
[23:33:08] <tegowai> aaa... serialization. Ok. Starting to understand... thanks!
[23:33:22] <prtksxna> tegowai: Do this http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
[23:33:28] <prtksxna> tegowai: And then the jQuery course
[23:33:31] <prtksxna> tegowai: It might help
[23:34:54] <tegowai> happy to find this irc channel. Ok. Will continue to watch Karl Swedberg lessons from pluralsight
[23:35:06] <zylophone> if $('.foo') returns more than one element, how do i target just one specific one where i know the index?
[23:35:21] <systemfault> zylophone: .eq(index)
[23:36:15] <zylophone> ahh thanks
[23:58:41] <hd1> http://imeecoach.com/~hdiwan/sentMsgs.html i'd like to turn the "Time" column in that output to ISO format... any ideas how to do about this? it's sourced from a log file that I can't change
