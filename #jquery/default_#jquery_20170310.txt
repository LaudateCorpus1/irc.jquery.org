[05:01:24] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/c1tsmghw/1/ what am i doing wrong here when i try to build same url as the first example?
[05:49:47] <robsco> on IE11, I have a mobile menu that's not working, no errors, could someone take a look and see if it's anything obvious?  http://santa.lavoco.com/  see menuToggler in http://santa.lavoco.com/public/js/main.js
[05:51:32] <robsco> even adding the "visible" class manually also doesn't show the menu, (if I wanted it displaying all the time, or at least on initial page load
[05:53:09] <Cork> robsco: check that the selectors actually find anything
[05:53:19] <Cork> ex. $('.menu_toggler').length
[05:53:22] <robsco> it works on all other browsers, so I assume they do
[05:54:30] <Cork> ah, but not in ie hmm
[05:54:45] <Cork> i would start by running the page through w3c validator and make sure nothing shows up there
[05:55:11] <Cork> and then start adding debug logging from the different functions and make sure each step does what it is suppose to do (in ie)
[05:55:23] <robsco> yeah ok
[06:07:35] <mogio> Hi folks
[06:09:00] <mogio> can sb give me a hint if there is a event ... like "onObjectWasInitializedInJquery" = function(){}
[06:09:47] <mogio> my problem is that I call videojs Object... which in my case is not created at this time... must be ms
[06:09:57] <mogio> dont want to use setTimeout
[06:10:55] <Cork> mogio: sb?
[06:11:06] <mogio> somebody
[06:11:34] <Cork> mogio: the best way for events is to delegate them to static parents
[06:11:51] <Cork> that way the event will work even on elements that didn't exist when you bound them
[06:12:09] <mogio> interesting... can you give an example?
[06:12:57] <Cork> mogio: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[06:13:40] <mogio> yeah that is standard event appending
[06:13:58] <Cork> also http://learn.jquery.com/events/handling-events/#binding-events-to-elements-that-don-39-t-exist-yet
[06:14:17] <Cork> mogio: as long as the event is triggered through jquery normally it should work with this too
[06:14:29] <Cork> anyway i'm off for lunch
[06:14:48] <mogio> not sure how that would help in my case
[06:16:18] <mogio> I would need something like $(tgt).on('initialized', 'videojs') = function(){};
[06:18:49] <mogio> Anybody else?
[06:26:04] <andromedian> Hi how can I have have a click event that starts an animation and then after you click again reverse the animation?

[06:40:14] <plg> Hello
[06:42:22] <plg> After decoding URI i get number of input type="button" with text between them
[06:42:47] <mogio> andromedian I would addClass
[06:43:04] <plg> How can get value of button and text between the buttons
[06:43:07] <mogio> the class defines an html5 animation (css)
[06:43:23] <plg> mogio:Please help
[06:44:05] <andromedian> hm makes sense mogio
[06:44:07] <andromedian> thanks
[06:44:26] <mogio> plg is the text within tags?
[06:44:32] <plg> yes
[06:45:06] <plg> input sometext input sometext
[06:45:28] <plg> I want input's value and sometext
[06:45:50] <plg> all inputs and sometext are different
[06:45:59] <mogio> $('tagClass').each(function(){my_arr[] = $(this).text()})
[06:46:23] <mogio> would give back an array of the tags text
[06:46:37] <mogio> you could use instead also .attr('name')
[06:46:45] <mogio> or .attr('value')
[06:46:54] <mogio> depend on the name of you attributes
[06:47:01] <mogio> depends

[07:50:05] <Anticom> Hi all. I'm looking for help with flot charting library for jquery. Is this considered on topic here or can someone recommend another channel?
[08:49:04] <BTM> Does anyone remember the URL to the site that had a sort of step by step guide on jquery?
[09:57:13] <saul> https://github.com/BenjaminRH/jquery-ticker <- trying to get this to work, but i get "jQuery is not defined" error
[09:57:51] <saul> it looks like they have a single large function defined in the .js file and at the end its argument is (jQuery) ... which im not sure is supposed to do
[10:35:32] <Hoder> is there a way to check if all buttons (of the same class) have been clicked? I want to append some HTML, but only if every button has been clicked, but I don't want to set up the if statement using nth-child
[10:37:18] <taplar> something on the page would need to hold state that a button was clicked.  and you'd check all of those
[10:38:15] <Hoder> So just add a class to them, of "clicked" then pull all of those by the new class?
[10:38:40] <taplar> that'd work
[10:39:17] <Hoder> Cool cool, thank you!
[11:47:16] <Elles> does scope exist in js? can I use function declared inside another function outside the function it was declared?
[11:47:59] <taplar> for the most part, the scope of things is the method they are defined in
[11:48:18] <Elles> thanks good then
[11:48:21] <Elles> tats*
[11:48:32] <Elles> whatever
[11:48:35] <taplar> basic variables in js though if you do not put a var in front of them, will be global
[11:49:13] <taplar> newer keywords change this in ES6.  such as 'let' and 'const' are block scope
[11:49:45] <Elles> thanks

[13:19:06] <imachine> hello!
[13:20:35] <imachine> I have experience with basic CSS/HTML, little to none with JS. I want to set up a simple counter, like the example one on this here page: http://hilios.github.io/jQuery.countdown/ - black background, flipping animated cards. I got the code embedded in the html properly, got jquery and the final countdown code downloaded. Anyone willing to lend a moment of their time and experience to help sort it out? I
[13:20:40] <imachine> reckon I'm able to purchase a pint in return via PayPal.
[13:26:21] <sigdk> gentlemen, any idea how to change the padding here: https://jsfiddle.net/ebRXw/2699/  ?
[13:35:51] <Woet> sigdk: where is your attempt?
[13:37:41] <sigdk> Woet, my attempts are locally and have been failing for quite long... I googled for a ready Datatables jsfiddle so I don't have to write it myself
[13:38:16] <sigdk> Woet, I fetch the data with an ajax call but I don't think it makes any difference
[13:38:58] <Woet> sigdk: and you've googled for things like "datatables padding" i assume?
[13:39:54] <sigdk> Woet, extensively
[13:40:05] <sigdk> I found this: https://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/row_callback.html   (didn't help though)
[13:40:32] <sigdk> I can change the color of the row but not the padding
[13:43:12] <Woet> sigdk: https://datatables.net/manual/styling/
[13:43:16] <Woet> sigdk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7786772/how-to-increase-cell-padding-in-jquery-datatables
[13:44:30] <sigdk> Woet, I saw the stackoverflow, the guy is using dataTable instead of DataTable
[13:44:41] <Woet> sigdk: and?
[13:44:53] <sigdk> and my padding didn't change
[13:45:08] <Woet> sigdk: then you didn't do it properly, because I tried on the jsfiddle and it works fine.
[13:45:20] <Woet> sigdk: you might have to use !important depending on your CSS.
[13:46:33] <sigdk> Woet, hmm, tbh, with !important it worked at the fiddle, let me check localy
[13:48:34] <sigdk> Woet, okay, worked also... ^-^
[13:48:48] <sigdk> Woet, any idea why the td is needed?
[13:48:58] <Woet> sigdk: why what is needed?
[13:49:48] <sigdk> the css looks like this: table.dataTable td {    why is that td there?
[13:50:02] <Woet> because you want padding on the td?
[13:50:06] <Woet> and not on the table?
[13:50:44] <sigdk> Woet, hmm... td is the cell, I want on rows
[13:50:53] <Woet> sigdk: how would you imagine that?
[13:51:16] <sigdk> Woet, okay, then that might be a problem, everything I tried I was using tr
[14:02:26] <ZoiX> Hello there, just a random question. Do you guys know what is the percentage (for the instructor) in those e-learning websites like PluralSight or Lynda?
[14:18:50] <Renari> I'm reading in a xml document via an ajax call, if I call console.log(xml) it dumps the xml file to the console correctly. However for some reason when I try to determine the validity of the xml document using $.parseXML(xml) this always seems to return null.
[14:19:06] <Renari> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[14:19:22] <Renari> The documentation here seems to show that it should be returning a jquery object.
[14:22:00] <Renari> Ah it seems the ajax call validates the xml and returns a xml object.
[14:31:45] <codecutter> is there a way to merge to maps do that all unique values are kept and duplicates removed?
[14:31:51] <codecutter> 2 maps*
[14:33:27] <codecutter> how do merge 2 map objects?
[14:33:51] <rickymiller> codecutter: Object.assign
[14:35:20] <rickymiller> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/ct8z7wpy/
[14:36:06] <rickymiller> there's also jQuery's .extend if you prefer: https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[14:36:10] <codecutter> does it keep dups?
[14:36:37] <codecutter> duplicates*
[14:37:07] <rickymiller> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/ct8z7wpy/1/
[14:37:50] <codecutter> that'll be no
[14:37:51] <codecutter> thanks
[14:37:52] <rickymiller> if thre's duplicate keys it'll use the second value
[14:38:06] <codecutter> thats what i'm after
[14:38:49] <rickymiller> codecutter: one thing to keep in mind is that Object.assign is quite new, so not that well supported
[14:39:01] <rickymiller> you'll need to polyfill if you want to target older browsers
[14:39:13] <codecutter> hmm
[14:39:29] <codecutter> can i see a jsfiddle with extend?
[14:40:40] <rickymiller> babel also has spread: https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&evaluate=false&lineWrap=true&presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-0&targets=&browsers=&builtIns=false&code=let%20n%20%3D%20%7B%20x%2C%20y%2C%20...z%20%7D%3B%0Aconsole.log(n)%3B%20%2F%2F%20%7B%20x%3A%201%2C%20y%3A%202%2C%20a%3A%203%2C%20b%3A%204%20%7D%0A
[14:40:59] <codecutter> i think i'll use extend
[14:41:18] <codecutter> how new is it?
[14:42:39] <rickymiller> ECMAScript 2015 (6th Edition, ECMA-262)
[14:43:29] <rickymiller> codecutter: you can check the compat table at the bottom here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign
[14:44:09] <rickymiller> if you're in doubt, you can just use .extend, or check that babel link for the polyfill (_extend)
[14:47:58] <codecutter> i'm going with .extend
[14:48:14] <codecutter> ie does not support assign
[14:48:19] <codecutter> not yet, anyway

[15:04:22] <anix_> hi everyone. i use jQuery for a web-app together with bootstrap 3 and mustache.js for client-side rendering. i enjoy the advantage of server-side rendering (with python pystache) especially for Search Engine Optimization and quick page load. now i'd like to add some "single page app" style behaviours for subsequent user interaction to improve performance, i.e. fewer full page-loads
[15:05:27] <anix_> of course i also would like to keep everything simple and hopefully can avoid to build the JS stuff twice
[15:06:52] <anix_> do you know of a lib or framework or just patterns how to add more SAP style behaviour to a jQuery based UI?
[15:31:27] <bigtymer37> can someone please help me with my jquery
[15:31:30] <bigtymer37> i cannot get it to work
[15:31:47] <bigtymer37> it is really simple code
[15:32:22] <imachine> ok
[15:32:35] <imachine> i got a question about js
[15:32:50] <imachine> i got a plugin, for jquery, want it to show code.
[15:33:11] <imachine> does it generate the code automatically once a corresponding div id/class is called in the html?
[15:33:18] <imachine> how to embed the generated markup is my question
[15:33:27] <imachine> i have little experience coding anything non-static
[15:34:11] <imachine> i know i use <script src=whatever.js></script> then I want to know how to implement the generated script into html
[15:46:04] <imachine> ok i got it working, no thanks to any of you
[16:16:36] <vladikoff> rickymiller, thanks for your help with my latest jqeury
[16:41:16] <bigtymer37> uhh i cant get this jquery function to work
[16:42:07] <taplar> ?
[16:44:41] <bigtymer37> zhttp://pastebin.com/9cyAZhHy
[16:44:44] <bigtymer37> http://pastebin.com/9cyAZhHy
[16:45:35] <bigtymer37> i cannot get it to return an alert
[16:46:06] <taplar> any console errors?
[16:46:24] <bigtymer37> no
[16:46:36] <bigtymer37> alert can display if i use
[16:46:40] <bigtymer37> alert(1);
[16:46:49] <taplar> and you confirmed that you are including that script on your page?
[16:46:54] <bigtymer37> yes
[16:46:59] <bigtymer37> well i can display alert
[16:47:03] <bigtymer37> if i write in main.js
[16:47:31] <bigtymer37> i can show u my header.ejs
[16:48:09] <bigtymer37> http://pastebin.com/928KsC0T
[16:48:50] <taplar> your jquery import is incorrect
[16:49:08] <taplar> you have <script> src=...
[16:52:58] <bigtymer37> ok so it imports
[16:53:08] <bigtymer37> but why cant i run the function
[16:53:57] <taplar> it should run if you fix the jquery import.  also you have a trailing </script> in that pastee
[16:54:36] <taplar> once you fix that, open your network tab and reload the page.  make sure those files are being pulled in with a success response code
[17:29:49] <Whiskey> anyway to convert this "_.forEach(captureGroups, (group, index) => {" to jQuery?
[17:30:32] <taplar> $.each(captureGroups, ...
[17:30:59] <taplar> you may have to swap the params though for the callback
[17:31:35] <taplar> yeah, $.each passes the index in first
[17:32:38] <Whiskey> yep :D
[17:32:52] <Whiskey> you know mutch about lodash.js?
[17:33:13] <taplar> played with it a little
[17:33:52] <Whiskey> $flags.on("keyup", onRegexChange);
[17:33:56] <Whiskey> thats a part of it?
[17:34:06] <taplar> no, that's jquery
[17:34:10] <Whiskey> awsome :D
[17:34:46] <Whiskey> think i got rid of the lib then :D
[17:38:21] <Whiskey> ok taplar
[17:39:39] <Whiskey> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/44/ why do i get "Scriptular is not defined"
[17:41:40] <taplar> how do i make that happen?
[17:42:18] <Whiskey> well we can do this insted
[17:43:32] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/45/ <-- there "test is undefined" click on can try an example
[17:43:54] <Whiskey> click "can try an example"
[17:44:04] <Whiskey> wtf "click on"
[17:46:08] <Whiskey> its cuz the script load before the html, but don´t docuemt ready fix that?
[17:46:48] <coderfromcincy> i always load the js library right above the closing body tag
[17:47:07] <Whiskey> i don´t like to do it that way thats why
[17:47:12] <coderfromcincy> along with document.ready of course..
[17:47:42] <taplar> i don't see the document ready in this fiddle
[17:48:08] <taplar> coderfromcincy: if you load at the end you don't really need the doc ready
[17:48:20] <coderfromcincy> never hurts taplar
[17:48:22] <Whiskey> tapler it make my functions undefined
[17:48:50] <taplar> your hitting the jquery overhead unnecessarily.
[17:48:50] <taplar> a simple IIFE would do the same scoping, and be more preformant in that case
[17:49:05] <Whiskey> hmm maybe
[17:49:12] <taplar> that was directed at coder
[17:49:46] <coderfromcincy> sure, but that's like throwing a pebble at a moving train taplar, it doesn't push you into a bottleneck lol
[17:49:46] <taplar> Whiskey: without the doc ready and loading before the body, your lookups are not going to find the elements, which is why they are empty
[17:50:17] <taplar> always a good decision to work best practices into your go to programming style
[17:50:59] <Whiskey> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/46/ give other errors :D
[17:51:00] <taplar> otherwise it's kinda like saying "why learn?"
[17:53:13] <coderfromcincy> appears to be a scope issue Whiskey
[17:53:26] <Whiskey> yeh i thinked that to but how to slove it
[17:53:35] <Whiskey> as if i take it outside it won´t find the vars again :D
[17:54:35] <taplar> oh
[17:54:46] <Whiskey> back at square one
[17:54:47] <taplar> Scriptular is a var inside the doc ready.  it's not global
[17:54:56] <taplar> you are trying to reference it directly on the element
[17:54:59] <Whiskey> but if i move it out
[17:55:01] <taplar> don't do that.  bind a click handler to that element
[17:55:11] <Whiskey> function onRegexChange(event) { will error
[17:55:51] <taplar> instead of using onclick="..." bind to the elements in your script
[17:56:00] <Whiskey> yeh i know what you mean
[17:56:28] <coderfromcincy> the element is in the dom when the page loads so you have to create an event listener
[17:56:55] <coderfromcincy> $(document).on("click","yourelementname",function(){//do something )};
[17:57:14] <coderfromcincy> isnt in the dom^
[17:57:44] <Whiskey> is it possible to do onclick whit multiply choises inside it?
[17:57:54] <Whiskey> or do i need to split them n ow
[17:57:57] <coderfromcincy> worked for me when i changed your jsfiddle with that
[17:58:29] <NCS_One> hi
[17:58:40] <taplar> it's in the dom when the doc ready runs so you can not have the delegate binding and just do a normal one
[17:58:40] <taplar> Whiskey: multiple choices?
[17:58:40] <coderfromcincy> sure, because the event listening will be passed "this" so you know the .currentTarget
[17:58:40] <coderfromcincy> listener^
[17:59:07] <Whiskey> yeh you see it has more then one way to go taplar
[17:59:23] <coderfromcincy> taplar is't not though
[17:59:23] <coderfromcincy> it's being injected later
[17:59:57] <taplar> it's in his markup
[17:59:57] <taplar> that's not 'injected'
[17:59:58] <NCS_One> if I have an attribute value, but dont know what attribute is it possible to find the element?
[18:00:55] <taplar> oh your talking about the clearfields and such
[18:01:20] <Whiskey> yeh
[18:01:28] <Whiskey> its 3 diffrent things inside the Scriptular
[18:01:56] <taplar> personally i'd advise against that
[18:02:00] <taplar> instead of replacing the whole shebang, just target the descriptive notice and change that
[18:02:22] <Whiskey> i don´t fallow
[18:02:26] <Whiskey> split them or not?
[18:03:18] <taplar> hold on i'm trying to figure out what your using result for
[18:03:58] <taplar> go ahead though and fix your onclick with the binding coder suggested.  doesn't hurt being a delegate
[18:04:00] <Whiskey> its "example/clearFields/makePermalink" in same function
[18:04:22] <Whiskey> so that onclick somehow need to tell where to go next
[18:05:13] <Whiskey> or split them up one by one is another way
[18:06:17] <taplar> i'm not following you.  makePermalink doesn't take any inputs arguments
[18:06:27] <Whiskey> jesus
[18:06:58] <Whiskey> "var Scriptular = {" need to be replaced whit "addEventListener('click', function() {" right?
[18:07:02] <Whiskey> But then where to know where to go
[18:07:17] <taplar> you are saying it does various things
[18:07:17] <taplar> and might need to be split up
[18:07:26] <Whiskey> yes it does
[18:07:48] <taplar> no, you don't change your definition
[18:07:48] <taplar> look, hold on
[18:08:27] <Whiskey> taplar: https://pastebin.nukenet.se/pvq28ggeo
[18:09:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/46/ i'm talking about fixing your static one first
[18:10:24] <gambl0re> hi everyone
[18:10:26] <Whiskey> yeh
[18:10:26] <Whiskey> <a href="#" id="makePermalink">Make permalink</a>
[18:10:26] <Whiskey> <a href="#" id="clearFields">Clear fields</a>
[18:10:28] <Whiskey> i do get that
[18:10:40] <Whiskey> and link click to that id
[18:11:04] <Whiskey> but question are still if them can stay in same function or if them need to be splitted
[18:11:35] <taplar> 'them'?
[18:11:45] <Whiskey> did you look at https://pastebin.nukenet.se/pvq28ggeo?
[18:11:50] <Whiskey> its "example/clearFields/makePermalink" in same function
[18:11:59] <Whiskey> as i allredy say alot of times now
[18:12:11] <taplar> yes, but i'm also looking at the fiddle which also has that
[18:12:26] <Whiskey> yes, so split it or can it be in same?
[18:12:33] <Whiskey> and if it is in same, how to know witch one to use
[18:13:03] <Whiskey> a i don´t care, i just split it what does that matter
[18:13:05] <taplar> the methods inside Scriptular?
[18:13:10] <Whiskey> yeh exactly
[18:14:04] <taplar> i mean, you can access them fine like that.  what's wrong with that structure?
[18:14:05] <taplar> that's really more of an organization question
[18:17:09] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/uva7a1oy/47/ <-- that right there, so long as you put the class on the elements that should be targeted by the methods, even if you create them after the page loads, should go to the method you want them to
[18:17:42] <Whiskey> aha you do it like that
[18:17:56] <Whiskey> i was on something totally else
[18:18:19] <taplar> whither or not you keep them in that object or not, that is really just your preference for organization
[18:18:40] <taplar> or any standards your shop might have
[18:22:20] <taplar> could probably shrink that if else chain in the makePermalink method
[18:27:32] <taplar> i needa carve out some time to play with vue
[18:28:14] <gambl0re> hhi everyone
[18:28:23] <taplar> yo
[18:29:10] <gambl0re> what is a good js library to create a catapult type animation. ball flies through the air, falls down,  bounces, stops
[18:30:29] <Whiskey> taplar: just cleaning up come whit an example soon
[18:30:38] <taplar> not sure.  i only know of animatecss, but i think it's mainly text stuff
[18:31:47] <taplar> might could do something with css steps
[18:41:22] <Whiskey> almost: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/48/
[18:42:29] <Whiskey> strange part is if you click on "try an example"
[18:42:38] <Whiskey> and then clear, and try an example again it won´t work
[18:42:40] <Whiskey> and no error :D
[18:43:38] <taplar> because you are direct binding on the elements, where as before they were delegates
[18:43:51] <taplar> the original try an example link you bound to is destroyed
[18:45:18] <Whiskey> what does that mean?
[18:45:39] <taplar> addEventListener puts the event handler on the dom element
[18:45:54] <Whiskey> but it should work whit document ready
[18:46:07] <taplar> when you do your example, you are removing that dom element and putting your result in that space
[18:46:17] <taplar> that dom element with the event handler on it is destroyed
[18:46:30] <taplar> then you later clear and create a new one, but that new one does not have the event handler on it
[18:47:22] <taplar> the only thing document ready does is delays script execution until the document is parsed into the dom.  also as a side effect gives you a scope.  it doesn't do anything other than that
[18:48:13] <Whiskey> lol i just relize i did not use jQuery :D
[18:49:39] <taplar> i understand you are putting the result in the space where that green block is, but is there a reason you are destroying it?  another option is to hide it when you have other stuff so it does not show.  then when you want it back you could just remove the other stuff and show it again, without having to rebuild it
[18:52:37] <Whiskey> $("#clearFields").on( "click", function() { don´t seems to do it ether
[18:53:01] <Whiskey> no wait
[18:53:40] <Whiskey> its just reload the page :D
[18:56:33] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:57:00] <taplar> i'm fixing to leave for the weekend.  that should maybe help explain delegation better
[18:59:55] <Whiskey> what i understand it read the whole body on it
[19:00:05] <Whiskey> when its activated, but i still don´t get how to prevent it
[19:00:19] <Whiskey> event.preventDefault(); maybe
[19:01:24] <taplar> you have href='' in the clearFields handler instead of href='#'
[19:01:30] <taplar> which is most likely why it is flashing
[19:01:40] <taplar> without a preventDefault
[19:01:49] <taplar> any who, have a good weekend everyone
[19:02:18] <Whiskey> well it still flash whit # if i don´t have eventPreventDefault
[19:24:05] <Whiskey> i don´t get it whatever i do the new ones are broken
[19:27:39] <Whiskey> hmmm
[20:18:10] <gh0st3d> anyone know what would cause jquery ajax to "timeout" before the request even gets to the php script? To clarify, a large file upload gets to my php script and uploads fine, but jquery ajax timesout before it even starts the actual upload
[21:24:29] <LFP6> Hey all. Is there a way to select an element that has an attribute name starting with a given string? IE, I want to select all elements with the attribute data-foo-* set
[21:26:03] <LFP6> Well, actually, this isn't useful since I set it on a property :/
[21:26:34] <LFP6> Wait, nvm again, I did use attributes
[21:29:11] <LFP6> Wow, wrong again, I can't read my own code.
[21:36:56] <D-rex> lfp6 https://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[21:37:32] <LFP6> I know about that, but it's not what I'm looking for
[21:37:39] <LFP6> I want to search for the name, not the value
[21:37:48] <LFP6> I'll just use a .each and check manually
[21:38:26] <D-rex> ?? just omit the value part and leave the attr
[21:38:39] <LFP6> But the attr can't have a wildcard in it
[21:38:56] <D-rex> $(element[attribute_name])
[21:39:54] <LFP6> I'm saying I want to return <div data-foo-a="bar"> as well as <div data-foo-b="bar">, by just searching for "data-foo-"
[21:48:59] <D-rex> lfp6 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26657398/jquery-how-to-select-value-by-attribute-name-starts-with/37203637#37203637
[21:49:43] <LFP6> Yeah, that's where I was going
[22:24:01] <gh0st3d> Anyone know what would cause ajax to get a timeout error when uploading a large image, even though the php script successfully uploads the image?
[22:24:27] <LFP6> php not responding to the request?
[22:25:29] <gh0st3d> Well the weird part is it looks like it's timing out before PHP even receives the request
[22:25:52] <gh0st3d> I put some debug messages in the PHP, they don't show up in the logs until after jquery has already thrown a timeout issue
[23:08:01] <D-rex> gh0st3d: make sure http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35558066/ajax-file-upload-timeouts-with-large-files thats not your issue
[23:08:06] <D-rex> check the http error
[23:08:53] <gh0st3d> I'm not getting any errors through apache. jQuery is returning error 504, gateway timeout
[23:09:45] <gh0st3d> I'm looking now to see if there's an apache equivalent of that client_max_body_size
[23:10:27] <D-rex> check the dev console network tab and see what code, if any, the page is throwing
[23:23:28] <gh0st3d> Ok, ran through it while watching the network tab. The status code still says 504 gateway timeout. The timing tab says 39s sending request, 1 minute waiting
