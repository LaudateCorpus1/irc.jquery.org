[09:34:22] <errorous> hello. Can I select an element that's inside an element that has display: none; ?
[09:35:42] <errorous> for some reason it doesn't really select it
[09:37:21] <thykka> errorous, what kind of selector are you using?
[09:37:22] <errorous> I do console.log(jQuery('#av-burger-menu-ul')); and I get a.fn.init {context: document, selector: "#av-burger-menu-ul"}
[09:38:39] <thykka> seems like the element is not present on the page when you're selecting it
[09:39:05] <thykka> you do have an element with id="av-burger-menu-ul", yes?
[09:39:08] <errorous> thykka I made sure the script waits for document ready
[09:39:19] <errorous> thykka also added it in the footer
[09:39:26] <errorous> but that element is created by js too
[09:39:38] <thykka> right, well you can't select it before it's in the DOM
[09:40:25] <errorous> so, I think the question is how can I make sure my code waits untl element exist, or runs the last
[09:41:03] <thykka> can't you move the selection after the code that creates the element?
[09:41:49] <errorous> thykka it's wordpress theme, so dynamically adds it. not sure how to make sure it's after that code
[09:42:01] <errorous> thykka did my besst, added it into footer
[09:42:32] <thykka> that doesn't help, if the element is added dynamically afterwards
[09:43:02] <errorous> when I load the page in browser and check, element is there
[09:43:13] <errorous> so, it's not created on any action or so
[09:43:45] <thykka> but it's created after your selector code
[09:44:14] <errorous> most likely yes
[09:44:16] <thykka> if you're waiting for the document to load before dynamically creating that element, you must wait until that is done before selecting it
[09:44:53] <errorous> the code that creates element most likely waits for document ready as well
[09:45:09] <thykka> that's what I'm suspecting
[09:46:48] <thykka> what are you trying to do with the element? Is it something that would wait for user input, rather than act right away once the page has loaded?
[09:47:09] <errorous> thykka trying to append something to it
[09:50:45] <thykka> I would look into the theme/plugin and try to see if it provides some kind of event you could hook to, ensuring your code runs after the theme/plugin code. If it doesn't, you might have to use a MutationObserver
[12:47:27] <z1haze> if you have an input listener such as `$formsToScrub.find(':input:not(:hidden)').on('input', debounce(async function () {`... in and then after that, i want to deregister that handler on one of the inputs in a certain use case, so i do `$form.find('[name$=address1]').off('input', debounce);` but it does not unbind the handler on this input
[12:47:41] <z1haze> is it because of the selector query?
[16:09:11] <admin123> how do you show a spinner when a form is submitted and continue submitting the form?
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean until the page reloads?
[16:09:49] <robertmaxrees> admin123
[16:09:51] <admin123> defining $("form").submit(() => { $("form").submit() }); will loop
[16:10:10] <robertmaxrees> correct - why would you call the submit method?
[16:10:11] <admin123> robertmaxrees: sure
[16:10:22] <robertmaxrees> you'd just do whatever to make it display in that callback.
[16:10:42] <admin123> and the browser will continue submitting?
[16:10:54] <robertmaxrees> why would that cause it to not?
[16:11:30] <admin123> so as long as I don't do e.preventDefault, the browser will run the callback and then continue submitting the data
[16:11:38] <robertmaxrees> well, be aware the browser may not show the spinner since the page is about to go somewhere else.
[16:11:52] <robertmaxrees> and in some cases, some browsers won't do UI updates if they don't need to.
[16:11:55] <robertmaxrees> but give it a shot.
[16:11:58] <robertmaxrees> should work.
[18:58:28] <admin123> is there a good jquery chat UI?
