[03:49:02] <ussher_> Trying to access a variable coming in with some response text and having trouble locating the syntax to do it: http://pastebin.com/hpRNFDSQ  How do I get the 'text' in the nested variable?
[03:58:25] <Cork> ussher_: first of you shouldn't need JSON.parse if the server isn't lying about what it sends (setting the application/json instead of text/html)
[03:58:54] <ussher_> Thanks cork. trying stuff without it.
[03:58:54] <Cork> ussher_: secondly notices.notices[0].type, notices.notices[0].text
[03:59:51] <Cork> ussher_: the response is json so there is no innerHTML
[04:00:53] <ussher_> you rock.
[04:01:28] <ussher_> I was getting frustrated, thowing a ton of stuff at it that I found on Stack Overflow, hence the innerHTML.
[04:01:56] <ussher_> Thank you very much :)
[04:02:54] <Cork> ussher_: but i strongly recommend fixing the server
[04:03:01] <Cork> it will make things A LOT cleaner
[04:03:22] <Cork> as tools will be able to display the responses correctly (as it won't try to read it as html)
[04:06:10] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/5La0crdt/
[04:06:36] <ussher_> so on a working corretly server it should be available at: request.responseText.notices[0].text
[04:07:00] <Cork> no, you should be able to use the response directly
[04:07:07] <Cork> not sure what request is in your code
[04:09:56] <ussher_> right now im trying to catch responses from other functions firing on the page so I can manipulate the page when the form submission completes. https://jsfiddle.net/4apmjb2b/
[04:11:02] <ussher_> but couldnt get any further because I couldnt target any variables.  can now, even if its not the best way.
[04:11:19] <Cork> ussher_: use ajaxSuccess then
[04:11:43] <ussher_> I'll go read.
[04:11:55] <Cork> last argument is the parsed data
[04:16:31] <ussher_> yes!  thats working.  :) thank you
[04:35:02] <manornk> Hi all, I have this code that includes steps. I want to change all H1 tags to H2 tags, but then everything breaks. How can I do that?  http://pastebin.com/U191JFNW
[04:35:54] <Cork> manornk: make a jsfiddle
[04:37:21] <manornk> Cork: I can't. This is code from Magento, and I am not good enough to edit it to work
[04:41:53] <HD|Laptop> hi all, on http://localhost:80/frontend/index.html I'm doing $.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/login",{username:"xxx",password:"yyy"},function(response) { ... });
[04:42:10] <HD|Laptop> this, in theory, should result in a CORS preflight request, yet the chrome devtools don't show it
[04:43:13] <Cork> HD|Laptop: yes, it should, can't say much more then that
[04:43:18] <Cork> check the server logs i guess
[04:44:20] <HD|Laptop> server is the "standard" php web server, it doesnt show an OPTIONS request too
[04:45:43] <HD|Laptop> Oh, Firefox doesnt send OPTIONS either
[04:46:54] <Cork> are they blockign the request?
[04:47:18] <Cork> ah
[04:47:27] <Cork> your doing get, that doesn't trigger preflight
[04:47:31] <Cork> only post do
[04:47:46] <Cork> on get it checks the cors header in the response
[04:48:01] <Cork> ...
[04:48:06] <Cork> it would help if i read...
[04:48:18] <Cork> (read $.post as $.ajax...)
[04:48:49] <Cork> HD|Laptop: so no, as far as i can tell it should trigger a preflight, can't say why it isn't
[04:51:11] <km4> hi guys
[04:57:32] <HD|Laptop> Cork: I'm running both servers (apache for the frontend, php's builtin) on my machine
[04:57:49] <HD|Laptop> so no firewall, and it even doesn't send OPTIONS in incognito mod
[05:23:00] <anli> Is there a way to get the element count for an element in the developer console of google chrome?
[05:23:13] <anli> i.e. the number of direct children
[05:24:14] <Cork> anli: $(elm).children().length
[05:24:45] <anli> No jquery on the page, also I expect it to be something in the console element for a node in the elements panel
[05:25:01] <anli> eh, I meant context menu
[05:25:11] <anli> "console element" did not fit in there
[05:25:16] <Cork> anli: elm.children.length then
[05:25:27] <anli> No id
[05:25:31] <anli> I can add one
[05:25:34] <anli> Still a hassle
[05:25:39] <Cork> why do you need an id?
[05:25:46] <Cork> you need to target the element
[05:25:48] <anli> I copy the html and count occurences in notepad++ :)
[05:25:53] <anli> How do I target it?
[05:26:48] <Cork> ugg. i don't remember how you do that in the chrome developer console
[05:27:00] <anli> My way of copying outer html seems to be the simplies
[05:27:02] <anli> +t
[05:27:07] <anli> And counting in a text editor
[05:29:10] <anli> Seems like the elements panel is not updated when the dom is rewritten
[05:29:13] <anli> Do I need to refresh it?
[05:30:35] <Cork> no, it is updated if the dom is modified
[05:31:44] <anli> Oh, ok?
[05:31:50] <anli> I am mistaken then?
[05:32:07] <Cork> anli: $1 gives you the currently marked element from the elements view
[05:32:21] <anli> Cool!
[05:32:35] <anli> The tip of the day!
[05:33:47] <anli> Hm, I selected tbody and $1.tagName shows TD
[05:34:27] <anli> $0 seems to be it
[06:32:33] <UniFreak> I'm using 1.11, how to bind event to dynamic generated elements?
[06:33:11] <UniFreak> I'm using $('selector').on('click', function() {}), but it didn't bind the event handler to newly added elements
[06:34:10] <sonotos> $('table').on('click','td', function() {});
[06:34:16] <sonotos> eg
[06:48:32] <UniFreak> sonotos: I tried this, guess I'm doing it wrong, I'll recheck my code
[06:50:14] <sonotos> UniFreak: you could paste the not working snippet via pastebin.com
[06:57:19] <UniFreak> sonotos: my mistake, I make a typo...
[06:58:00] <sonotos> happens :-)
[07:04:29] <manornk> Someone please help. Why does my code breaks when I edit H1 to H2 tags. http://pastebin.com/U191JFNW
[07:04:41] <manornk> I was working on this for 5 hours now and nothing
[08:47:52] <km4> if I resize textarea use keyup or keydown better ?
[08:51:28] <codecutter> line 3 seems to work but line 2 fails (replace) fails http://pastebin.com/Xc4dRkes
[08:56:39] <Cork> km4: input
[08:57:09] <Cork> codecutter: .replace returns the new string you need to set it again
[08:57:20] <Cork> $().attr('href', $().attr('href'))
[09:00:08] <codecutter> Cork: like this? $($elem).attr('href').replace($($elem).attr('/friendships/follow/'),($elem).attr('/friendships/destroy/'));
[09:00:15] <Cork> no
[09:00:33] <Cork> .attr('href') grabs the value from the attribute
[09:00:39] <codecutter> good, cause the faiss :)
[09:00:41] <Cork> .attr('href', val) sets it
[09:00:46] <codecutter> that fails*
[09:00:47] <km4> hm
[09:00:52] <codecutter> let me try that...
[09:01:32] <z1haze_work> can anyone think of how id fire events at certain times during an embedded youtube video? example: I have a video of a woman getting a makeover, and they want to place next tothe video a link to the current product they are using in the video, as the video changes to a new product, they want the product link in the sidebar to also change.. its poss
[09:01:32] <z1haze_work> ible i've seen it on a site, its just heavily obfuscated and cant code it
[09:02:14] <Cork> z1haze_work: you can't do it with a youtube link
[09:02:20] <Cork> but if it is a video tag you can
[09:02:21] <z1haze_work> you can.
[09:02:28] <z1haze_work> no youtube emebd
[09:02:32] <z1haze_work> it can be done
[09:02:45] <Cork> well check the youtube api then
[09:02:51] <Cork> cause it has to provide it
[09:02:55] <z1haze_work> it doesnt unfortunately
[09:03:03] <Cork> it is xss so you can't access the video directly
[09:03:08] <Cork> then you can't
[09:03:19] <z1haze_work> these folks who have done it have used some creative enginuity
[09:03:23] <Cork> youtube has to fire a cross domain message for you to be able to trigger on it
[09:03:31] <z1haze_work> i understand that, but we arent doing an xss
[09:03:37] <z1haze_work> cors wouldnt play a role here
[09:03:40] <Cork> uh
[09:03:49] <Cork> so you use video.google.com direct links?
[09:03:58] <Cork> else you ARE doing xss
[09:04:09] <z1haze_work> .. using the youtube iframe api im assuming
[09:04:10] <Cork> your domain > youtube
[09:04:15] <Cork> ya, that is xss
[09:04:17] <z1haze_work> you can create a player, load a video, etc
[09:04:23] <Cork> ya, that is xss
[09:04:25] <z1haze_work> ok sorry
[09:04:28] <z1haze_work> yea, you said that.
[09:04:45] <Cork> and as the scripts running on there site has to expose the data to you, you can only do what they expose
[09:04:59] <z1haze_work> like i said, they've come up with a custom solution
[09:05:10] <z1haze_work> with im sure just some realyl good procedure code
[09:05:16] <Cork> that has to depend on what data they expose
[09:05:19] <z1haze_work> i just cant wrap my head around he logic
[09:05:23] <Cork> as that is the only thing you can work with
[09:05:35] <z1haze_work> not really - its like this:
[09:05:46] <Cork> well except unless you grab the raw video link an play it directly in a <video> tag
[09:05:50] <Cork> (that is possible)
[09:06:02] <z1haze_work> on my website, i pull from the server an array of objects containing a 'step' that is the seconds in which a step begins, with and a 'product' which contains the product id i want to pull in
[09:07:22] <z1haze_work> i need to allow users to click overlay buttons to change video to certain time (that is easy via the api) and i need to update the product displayed in the sidebar when they click the step (also easy) what i cant figure out, is how to automatically have the products change as the player plays on its own, and even check when a user rewinds the video
[09:07:22] <z1haze_work>  mid step, it still keeps in sync
[09:07:25] <z1haze_work> http://www.dior.com/beauty/en_us/th/dior_makeup_how_to.html#expand/diorshow-by-hanneli example here
[09:07:42] <z1haze_work> ive figured out how to do all but the last part
[09:16:54] <z1haze_work> so once you see it works you have nothing to suggest haha?
[09:17:46] <Cork> haven't even looked, i just have better things to do then argue with you
[09:17:58] <z1haze_work> whos fucking arguing?
[09:18:13] <z1haze_work> you tell me somethings not possible, i show you proof that it is and you call it arguing..
[09:18:18] <z1haze_work> get over yourself
[09:20:46] <km4> have a small problem, not working
[09:20:54] <km4> css({bottom: start + 10 + 'px'});
[09:21:10] <km4> var start = $().height();
[09:21:18] <Cork> km4: try (start + 10) + 'px'
[09:21:37] <km4> ok moment
[09:21:47] <Cork> btw you don't need 'px' jquery will add it if the value is a number
[09:24:30] <km4> hm dont work
[09:24:41] <Cork> ok, what isn't working then?
[09:25:04] <Cork> (doesn't work is a horrible problem description, please avoid it)
[09:26:51] <km4> have in console start + 10  = 50px10
[09:27:03] <Cork> so start is a string not a number
[09:27:03] <km4> string
[09:27:08] <km4> yeap
[09:27:20] <Cork> you have already added 'px' to it (you should avoid that)
[09:27:55] <Cork> alternatively you can do something like parseFloat(start.replace(/px$/, ''))
[09:28:02] <km4> 68px50px :P
[09:28:05] <Cork> but i really recommend not converting it to start with
[09:28:17] <Cork> km4: again remove the px
[09:28:28] <Cork> don't convert the numbers to a string before trying to do math
[09:28:52] <km4> foo = this.$top.css('bottom') + 50
[09:29:00] <km4> then have 68px50
[09:31:00] <Cork> km4: https://jsfiddle.net/1zequy7k/
[09:32:38] <km4> ok I have parseInt
[09:32:58] <km4> thanks
[09:33:09] <Cork> if you use parseInt don't forget the base
[09:33:15] <Cork> parseInt(num, 10)
[09:33:24] <Cork> never do parseInt(num)

[09:55:53] <z1haze_work> how do you expose a variable inside of a module.export
[09:56:22] <z1haze_work> actually nevermind
[10:22:08] <Koopz> hi guys... i'm in dire need of your assistance... i've got a form element with a name="characteristic[0][elements][0][name]" and need to find out the number in the first [0]
[10:22:16] <Koopz> how would i do that?
[10:23:22] <taplar> that's terrible
[10:23:24] <taplar> :P
[10:24:18] <Koopz> no complaining!
[10:24:32] <Koopz> need to find out that index
[10:29:06] <taplar> something like https://jsfiddle.net/bxj4zynL/
[10:29:35] <sillyslux>  /\[(\d)+\]/.exec('name="characteristic[0][elements][0][name]"')
[10:34:21] <yottabyte> if you pass an array as data in $.post(url, myArray), do you have to get it on your server as "myArray[]"?
[10:34:41] <Ales> do i have to use nodejs to make js doing automation for example reading data from txt and typing it in box on page and then save result
[10:38:17] <`slikts> does $('img').load(bla) fire immediately if the image is already loaded?
[10:38:50] <shoky> `slikts: nope
[10:38:57] <shoky> it won't fire
[10:38:58] <`slikts> how could I make it do that?
[10:39:12] <`slikts> .is(':loaded') maybe?
[10:39:24] <`slikts> oh, img.prop('complete')
[10:40:23] <shoky> not sure that's totally cross-browser
[10:40:48] <Justice> am i dense or why does this not work? https://jsfiddle.net/nyjqavzx/1/
[10:41:20] <shoky> hm i guess it is
[10:41:43] <sillyslux> there https://jsfiddle.net/nyjqavzx/2/
[10:41:44] <taplar_meeting> inline scripts have to exist before their bindings
[10:42:06] <taplar_meeting> fwiw, don't use onclick.  bind in your logic
[10:42:26] <shoky> they dont have to exit before, they just have to exist globally ;p
[10:42:29] <shoky> exist
[10:42:45] <shoky> (and jsfiddle doesn't put your script globally by default
[10:42:45] <shoky> )
[10:42:51] <taplar_meeting> ah
[10:44:07] <Justice> ah
[10:45:05] <Justice> now to a "harder" getting the attr; https://jsfiddle.net/nyjqavzx/3/ ;O
[10:45:32] <shoky> don't use onclick attributes
[10:45:48] <z1haze_work> is this the recommended alternative to 'setInterval' ? http://dpaste.com/0FFX9CD
[10:46:05] <shoky> Justice:  $('#lol').on('click', krah);    function krah() { $(this).attr(whatever) }
[10:46:06] <Cork> Justice: you would your calling a function from the onclick attribute, so it doesn't have this
[10:46:40] <Cork> onclick="krah.call(this)" is what you would have to do (but as shoky says DON'T)
[10:46:53] <sillyslux> there https://jsfiddle.net/nyjqavzx/4/
[10:47:27] <Cork> sillyslux: not fully true
[10:47:34] <Cork> you can use this with onclick attributes
[10:48:05] <sillyslux> onclick="krah.call(this)" <- oh that's a new one for me :)
[10:48:15] <Justice> indeeed
[10:48:21] <z1haze_work> how do you clear a setTimeout when you arent doing setTimeout() as a variable?
[10:48:45] <Cork> z1haze_work: you can give it the function you used
[10:48:53] <Cork> but best is to store the reference in a variable
[10:49:00] <shoky> for (var i=0; i<9999999;i++) clearTimeout(i);        :D
[10:49:05] <Justice> why is onclick bad?
[10:49:16] <Cork> Justice: for a long list of reasons
[10:49:19] <shoky> Justice: for the reasons you've just experienced, and more ;p
[10:49:23] <Cork> 1. it mixes html and js
[10:49:33] <Cork> 2. it means everything has to be global, as you don't have scope
[10:49:44] <Cork> 3. it means you can't use more then one event handler per element
[10:49:47] <sillyslux> Justice want a 2nd onclick handler? like onclick2
[10:49:59] <Justice> hm
[10:50:14] <Cork> 4. it forces the code to use eval, and that is bad
[10:50:20] <Cork> and so on
[10:50:25] <z1haze_work> how would I stop this timer in this case? http://dpaste.com/3B1KHBH
[10:51:06] <Cork> z1haze_work: store the timer  on line 3 as a scoped variable
[10:51:10] <Cork> and use it in the stop action
[10:51:14] <z1haze_work> so i can just use the function name and not use like time = setTimeout, etc
[10:51:18] <z1haze_work> ah ok
[10:51:35] <z1haze_work> thats what i have seen in examples i didnt know if that was the only way
[10:52:28] <z1haze_work> if i create the variable inside of setCurrentTime() though, wont onPlayerStateChange() not have access to it?
[10:52:34] <shoky> clearTimeout works with the function..?
[10:52:43] <Cork> shoky: ya
[10:53:16] <z1haze_work> i just thoughtit had to be  variable
[10:53:37] <Cork> shoky: interestingly enough it isn't documented on the mdn page so... migth have been removed
[10:54:18] <z1haze_work> ive never seen it with a function :\
[10:54:27] <shoky> Cork: it's also not working for me on chrome
[10:54:40] <sillyslux> no deprecation notice?
[10:55:24] <z1haze_work> So in order to clear a settimeout i have to declare a variable at the top of my file or something, and then clear interval on that variable
[10:55:49] <shoky> as long as you can access it from wherever you want to clear, ya
[10:56:12] <shoky> like any other variable you want to use ;p
[10:56:53] <z1haze_work> yea, darn
[10:57:06] <z1haze_work> gonna have an extra variable for almost no reason
[11:00:51] <codecutter> whats the quickest way to remove the '.png' from 'foo.png'?
[11:01:10] <Cork> .replace(/\.png$/, '')
[11:01:41] <codecutter> how about all chars after period?
[11:01:49] <codecutter> including the period
[11:03:36] <z1haze_work> my function here: http://dpaste.com/0R5RMHQ is only being called once
[11:04:03] <z1haze_work> shouldnt it be running every second?
[11:04:23] <Cork> codecutter: (/\..*/, '') would replace everything after the first period
[11:04:30] <Cork> though that might be more then you want
[11:04:36] <shoky> z1haze_work: no check the casing in the name
[11:04:47] <shoky> you're probably getting errors..
[11:04:49] <z1haze_work> gahh
[11:04:56] <Cork> codecutter: (/\.[^.]*$/, '') would replace everything including the last period
[11:04:59] <codecutter> that will do.
[11:05:03] <z1haze_work> thanks
[11:05:15] <sillyslux> .replace(/\..+$/, '')
[11:05:34] <Cork> sillyslux: wouldn't really make a difference
[11:05:35] <shoky> that would just replace some dots
[11:05:41] <shoky> oh oops
[11:06:06] <Cork> sillyslux: the only difference is that it wouldn't replace 'foo.'
[11:06:10] <sillyslux> but is a valid answer?
[11:06:33] <Cork> yes, it would do the same as (/\..*/, '')
[11:06:38] <Cork> except for the 'foo.' case
[11:07:09] <Cork> but be slower cause the machine has to look ahead
[11:07:27] <sillyslux> .replace(/\.(.+)?$/, '')
[11:07:39] <Cork> uh... that's just silly
[11:07:46] <sillyslux> :D
[11:07:49] <sillyslux> that's me
[11:07:49] <Cork> if you want that match just use \..*
[11:08:16] <Cork> as (.+)? == .*
[11:08:44] <sillyslux> (.+)? would also match foo.
[11:08:54] <Cork> and so would \..*
[11:09:18] <sillyslux> i meant: would match the 'foo.' case
[11:09:24] <Cork> i know
[11:09:40] <sillyslux>  \..* wouldn't
[11:09:45] <Cork> try it :)
[11:09:51] <sillyslux> tried it
[11:10:25] <Cork> 'foo.'.replace(/\..*/, '')
[11:10:26] <Cork> "foo"
[11:10:30] <Cork> works perfectly
[11:10:43] <sillyslux> nope, i didn't *!=+
[11:11:00] <sillyslux> + is one and more
[11:11:05] <Cork> uh...
[11:11:12] <Cork> + is one and more
[11:11:13] <sillyslux> * is like +?
[11:11:17] <Cork> ()? is you can exclude it
[11:11:28] <Cork> so (.+)? === .*
[11:11:35] <sillyslux> yeah
[11:11:38] <Cork> ...
[11:11:47] <Cork> sigh
[11:11:52] <sillyslux> i'd like to do more regexes
[11:12:03] <sillyslux> now
[11:42:37] <Koopz> https://jsfiddle.net/h9k17wLa/ <- why does this log "[0]" instead of "0"?
[11:43:17] <robertmaxrees> because that's what you're selecting - the regex includes [].
[11:43:33] <Koopz> but what about the group?
[11:43:49] <robertmaxrees> m[1]
[11:44:26] <Koopz> ugh...
[11:44:56] <Koopz> thanks
[11:45:01] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[11:54:34] <Koopz> new problem: characteristics[0][elements][0][description] <- i need to replace the 2 occurences of "0" with 2 different variables... any suggestions?
[11:54:44] <robertmaxrees> .replace()
[11:54:57] <Koopz> does it support multiple arguments for replacing?
[11:55:03] <taplar_meeting> physically harm whomever made you use that name
[11:55:26] <robertmaxrees> does each need to be replaced separately?
[11:55:35] <Koopz> yep
[11:55:36] <robertmaxrees> with a different var, i mean.
[11:55:38] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[11:55:43] <robertmaxrees> you could do 2 calls to .replace()
[11:55:49] <robertmaxrees> or do what taplar is suggesting.
[11:56:01] <taplar> :)
[11:56:05] <Koopz> i don't feel like hitting myself :D
[11:56:20] <taplar> so you are intentionally create the name like that?
[11:56:27] <taplar> not using something prebuilt?
[11:56:40] <Koopz> what's so bad about that name?
[11:56:49] <taplar> your overloading the id with logic
[11:56:53] <taplar> that's not its purpose
[11:56:55] <taplar> err, name
[11:56:59] <taplar> use data fields
[11:57:02] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[11:57:07] <Koopz> data what?
[11:57:12] <robertmaxrees> data attributes.
[11:57:13] <taplar> data-*
[11:57:21] <Koopz> the name is actually generated by a php framework
[11:57:39] <robertmaxrees> backing up for a second - why are you trying to replace things in the name?
[11:57:42] <Koopz> and i need those numbers so my POST data looks like it should
[11:58:03] <Koopz> 'cause i'm doing an ajax call to get me a few form elements
[11:58:08] <Koopz> and they have 0 by default
[11:58:25] <taplar> ok, so ignore those, and just set your data attributes
[11:58:33] <taplar> and then use those
[11:58:47] <taplar> unless your doing a basic post
[11:59:23] <Koopz> basic post?
[11:59:27] <taplar> form sumit
[11:59:38] <Koopz> guess what i'm doing :D
[11:59:50] <taplar> :(
[12:00:09] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't just manually create the names?
[12:00:27] <robertmaxrees> wait if they're always going to be [0] why not just manually replace them?
[12:00:34] <robertmaxrees> like, why a regex at all?
[12:00:51] <Koopz> can't quite follow...
[12:01:11] <Koopz> data = data.replace(/\b0\b/g, newIndex); <- that's what i've done when i had just one level
[12:01:26] <robertmaxrees> back up - you said they're always going to be [0] by default, right?
[12:01:32] <Koopz> yes
[12:01:37] <robertmaxrees> why use a regex at all then?
[12:01:53] <robertmaxrees> why not just .replace('[0]', '[1432132414]'); for each one?
[12:02:15] <Koopz> does replace only replace the first occurence?
[12:02:34] <robertmaxrees> if you give it a string for the first arg, yes.
[12:02:44] <Koopz> fine by me
[12:02:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you could us a global regex to do both at once.
[12:02:52] <Koopz> oh hold on
[12:02:56] <robertmaxrees> but i'm guessing you want them to be diofferent values.
[12:03:04] <Koopz> i've got multiple elements in that data
[12:03:17] <Koopz> so multiple element names to replace
[12:03:49] <z1haze_work> is there anyway to when changing the src of an image to fire tell when the image is loaded?
[12:07:23] <Koopz> i'll leave that to my future self... i'm callin' it a day...
[12:07:28] <Koopz> i'll be back!
[12:07:38] <Koopz> till then...
[12:08:48] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work it should fire anyway.  but you have to bind the listener BEFORE you change the source.
[12:09:59] <z1haze_work> what event is it that is firing?
[12:10:03] <robertmaxrees> load
[12:10:24] <z1haze_work> oh, so how would i write my script to load when only changing the src?
[12:10:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:10:53] <z1haze_work> lets say i already have an img tag on my page
[12:11:01] <z1haze_work> making an ajax call returns a new src for the image
[12:11:18] <z1haze_work> i want to toggle a class to the image to change its opacity, then load the new image, then remove the class
[12:11:53] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[12:12:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not going to be easy.
[12:12:23] <z1haze_work> heh
[12:12:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably create a new image element, pop it into the page, add the listener, then remove the original image when the new one has loaded.
[12:12:37] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[12:12:40] <z1haze_work> well i want a sort of transition
[12:13:14] <robertmaxrees> your issue is dynamically creating image elements.
[12:58:54] * taplar *crickets*
[13:37:54] <decx> i liked shopify until i got the following contract "just port our existing shop to shopify"
[13:39:13] <robertmaxrees> ew
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> whyyyy
[13:39:49] <decx> dont ask
[13:39:58] <decx> i'm rewriting smarty into liquid. it's so boring
[13:39:59] <robertmaxrees> TOO LATE BUDDY
[13:40:03] <robertmaxrees> D:
[13:40:08] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[13:40:22] <decx> even worse now
[13:40:45] <decx> last week i did a kick ass storage movement spa app in vue
[13:41:06] <decx> like 2 days from concept to working prototype
[13:41:15] <robertmaxrees> niiiice
[13:41:27] <decx> it's ridiculously fun
[13:42:12] <decx> everything about a component in one file <template> <script> <style> with scoped scss
[13:42:59] <decx> no jsx, no weird react style objects
[13:43:10] <decx> just plain old fun
[14:50:17] <z1haze_work> is it possible to query for a element with a data-attribute?
[14:50:50] <z1haze_work> like select the element where the data atribute = something
[15:02:30] <NoiseEee> yes
[15:02:42] <NoiseEee> $)
[15:02:54] <NoiseEee> $('div[data-something="someVal"]')
[15:48:24] <Ales> why not working? https://jsfiddle.net/vyrzamtq/2/
[15:52:04] <z1haze_work> how can i break out of a for loop?
[15:52:16] <z1haze_work> im using break; but doesnt seem to be doing anything?
[15:52:37] <z1haze_work> my code: http://dpaste.com/189WAZE
[15:54:00] <muley> return false;
[15:54:10] <muley> oooh nevermine...
[15:54:36] <muley> was thinking you meant a jquery .each() =/
[15:59:01] <shoky> z1haze_work: you want  i >= 0
[15:59:56] <shoky> z1haze_work: oh sorry nevermind
[15:59:58] <islalobo> I'm updating an image src with ajax but the format of the image is /profile/img/{userId}{extension} ie, $('#profilePicture').attr('src', '/profile/img/'+image);
[16:00:16] <NoiseEee> ok
[16:01:01] <islalobo> It works most of the time, however if the user tries to update repeated sometimes the image doesn't update because the path is the same
[16:01:24] <z1haze_work> i figured it out i just had to rethink it
[16:01:33] <islalobo> Is there something I can do with my ajax callback to get the application to recognize this as a new image?
[16:22:03] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: so i finished that youtube player thing, not so impossible
[20:13:12] <dp> I know this isn't the best place to ask; but does anyone know of a plugin that has a feature similar to a facebook feature that, when you're typing in the status box, it will search to see if that word you're typing is a tag, and allow you to do something with it?
[20:14:21] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16646797/jquery-facebook-tagging
[20:14:25] <duch_kazatel> lots of SO posts on the subject.
[20:14:28] <duch_kazatel> nothing specific though.
[20:15:18] <dp> Excellent. Thanks!
