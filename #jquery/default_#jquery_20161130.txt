[00:02:29] <aro> thanks systemfault, that was the problem. fixed now!
[00:02:49] <systemfault> Cool :)
[00:13:34] <aro> if i declare a var to be a no conflict instance, is it possible to pass that to instances of $ in a function?
[00:13:58] <aro> like, if i did: var jq181 (for 1.8.1) = jQuery.noConflict(true);
[00:14:47] <aro> i know that for the shoddy plugin i had, i would use this: (function($) { ... })(jq181);
[00:15:10] <aro> but i have a function that is not a plugin, but more of like a pseudo class, that does some actions, including running stuff from tha tplugin
[00:15:34] <aro> how would i make sure that the instances in that function use that?
[00:16:51] <aro> because when i run a handler for that plugin - it still seems to load the main jquery library (which is 1.12.4)
[00:32:52] <gry> systemfault, if I may, what is going on here? https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/9/
[00:44:45] <gry> may this channel please be a tad more active? :) jquery is a wonderful tool, but the people are jjust hanging out somewhere else, and that's disappointing. I don't have any jquery friends to invite, not connected with any programming people but I hope you are
[00:45:19] <systemfault> Tons of people are from north america here... It's nearly 1am on the east coast.
[00:45:32] <systemfault> We mostly all work during weekdays
[00:45:49] <systemfault> jQuery is also not as popular as it used to be.
[00:46:06] <systemfault> What is line 4 supposed to do?
[00:46:24] <systemfault> Finally... Sorry, but not everyone "want" or "can" help you
[00:48:54] <gry> ooh, so I come back several hours later and start giving people a shout in this timezone? sounds a bit typical for things that I do.. thanks though
[00:49:14] <gry> mediawiki still uses jquery, even though they're moving away from jquery.ui, jquery still stays
[00:50:19] <systemfault> What is line 4 in your example supposed to do?
[00:50:55] <systemfault> jQuery UI is and has always been a big monolithic pile of shit.
[00:50:56] <aro> is it possible to load a plugin using an older version of jquery?
[00:51:16] <systemfault> aro: Not if the plugin uses new functionalities.
[00:51:23] <aro> it uses old functions
[00:51:25] <systemfault> Of course... it's a case-by-case thing
[00:51:27] <aro> it doesnt work with new jquery
[00:52:01] <systemfault> jQuery migrate can sometimes fix that...
[00:52:55] <aro> it works with 1.8.x
[00:53:02] <aro> but fails at 1.9+
[00:54:22] <systemfault> The jquery migrate plugin can sometimes fix that.
[00:54:27] <systemfault> Try it and see
[00:55:13] <aro> lets see
[00:57:36] <aro> hmm now whenever i click on my page i get an exception in JS
[00:59:10] <gry> systemfault, it's alert. it needs to count ht number of h2 elements in that code
[00:59:23] <gry> systemfault, preferably dynamically without inserting it into the current document DOM
[01:00:29] <systemfault> gry: https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/11/ ?
[01:01:41] <gry> systemfault, wonderful idea, thanks. :) What is the difference -- why does it not work the way I had it originally?
[01:03:28] <systemfault> gry: The second argument should be the root node for a find... and that doesn't work because the h2 is at the first level
[01:03:56] <systemfault> find looks "inside", not the element it's called on
[01:04:15] <gry> you mean 'filter' looks inside
[01:04:32] <gry> wait, no
[01:05:04] <gry> you mean that '$("h2")', when a second argument is specified, is not recursive?
[01:05:10] <aro> systemfault: when i run it i get this weird error: http://www.screencast.com/t/vqTW0Gb7UWq
[01:05:31] <aro> it happens when i click the button handler
[01:06:03] <systemfault> gry: It is... it's just that parseHTML will strip the body tag
[01:06:18] <systemfault> gry: So you're left with a jquery object with 3 nodes in it
[01:06:40] <gry> and what does the $() it do? look only at the first one, or what?
[01:07:09] <systemfault> I don't even know what passing multiple nodes as the second param does.
[01:07:22] <systemfault> It doesn't make sense to me... so I never tried.
[01:09:26] <gry> systemfault, have a go at this one https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/14/ , removing body tag or placing h2 first doesn't help $() to start seeing it
[01:09:55] <gry> I'm thinking that $('selector', domThingie) style of work is not so good after all, .filter() is more proper
[01:11:43] <aro> i fixed it
[01:12:06] <aro> that line 2369, needs to be if typeof elem.getAttribute === 'function'
[01:34:22] <gry> Oh, and I broke it again by nesting the h2 inside of a div - find() is not recursive or something? https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/15/ I really would like to get all h2 elements counted and not something lazy from it
[01:34:34] <gry> err filter() is not recursive even
[01:36:16] <gry> https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/16/ a more involved example of the same
[02:01:24] <Cork> gry: filter doesn't traverse at all
[02:01:36] <Cork> it is, as the function name says a filter
[02:01:43] <Cork> so it works with the current match set
[02:02:26] <Cork> gry: also a fragment can't have a body tag, so the string is invalid
[02:03:47] <Cork> gry: https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/17/
[02:04:05] <Cork> (also don't forget to define your variables)
[02:04:11] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/18/
[03:54:06] <gry> Hi Cork. I get a string with html, head, and body tags from a server. How do I parse that, if I am not even able to parsedData.anything() meaningful?
[03:54:48] <Cork> gry: if possible you should correct what the server sends
[03:54:55] <Cork> as the content is invalid
[03:55:14] <gry> it is supposed to send the whole thing with html and body included by design, I think it is not opt-in
[03:55:20] <Cork> if you can't, then you can pass it though $.parseHTML and the dom error correction will ignore the head and body elements
[03:55:39] <Cork> gry: well if you depend on the content in head you can't do it
[03:55:57] <Cork> then you need to use iframes
[03:56:18] <Cork> ajax isn't for loading new pages, it is for loading partial content for the current page
[03:56:33] <gry> I would be glad to remove the additional data and only leave the stuff within <body> tag, but I don't know how to do that.
[03:56:59] <Cork> well, like i said, as long as you don't need anything outside body
[03:56:59] <gry> What I am doing is receiving the data from server, manipulating it, and sending it back. Only the within-body area is being manipulated and everything else is not.
[03:57:08] <gry> I don't need anything outside body. :)
[03:57:16] <Cork> you can just pass it through $.parseHTML and the dom error content will ignore the invalid parts
[03:57:57] <gry> I think I am already passing it through that at https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/16/, but it only finds one h2 and not both.
[04:01:05] <gry> Cork, which leaves me confused as to what you suggest.
[04:01:10] <gry> To change.
[04:13:03] <Cork> gry: you don't have to change anything
[04:13:16] <gry> Cork, but then it finds only one h2 out of two
[04:13:23] <Cork> gry: you should just realize that the browser will error correct the content in the string
[04:13:42] <gry> so it deletes one of these two h2 elements? or what?
[04:13:50] <Cork> gry: cause you have to combine find and filter if any of them are as the outer most element
[04:14:24] <gry> oh, filter is only outermost, and find it only inner ones?
[04:14:29] <Cork> no
[04:14:45] <Cork> when you do $(something) it makes an array of all the outer most elements
[04:14:55] <Cork> those are _each one_ a parent
[04:15:02] <Cork> .find looks for children of those parents
[04:15:08] <Cork> .filter filters the array
[04:15:25] <Cork> .find can't find them cause they aren't in a dom (they are the top of them)
[04:15:35] <gry> ohh so find finds those tucked away inside, and filter only searches non recursively
[04:15:57] <Cork> no, you're mixing the concepts
[04:16:14] <Cork> ex. $('<div></div>')
[04:16:33] <Cork> it generates an array with [<DivElement>]
[04:16:44] <Cork> filter looks through that array
[04:17:05] <Cork> find on the other hand takes each element in the array and does a elm.querySelectorAll on it
[04:17:16] <Cork> finding elements with it as a parent or grand parent
[04:17:29] <Cork> so; filter doesn't know about dom at all
[04:17:37] <Cork> it just looks at what is in the result array
[04:17:47] <Cork> while .find is a dom traverser and searchs the dom tree
[04:18:13] <gry> find checks only children
[04:18:17] <gry> filter checks only the outermost
[04:18:23] <Cork> no....
[04:18:37] <gry> odd, I'm reading you and that's what you are saying
[04:18:39] <Cork> your still making filter know about relations
[04:18:54] <Cork> $('h2') <-- finds all h2 in the page
[04:19:00] <gry> filter does not look inside, it doesn't care
[04:19:02] <Cork> $('h2').filter('.class1')
[04:19:14] <Cork> this one filters of the element with a class .class1
[04:19:20] <Cork> that is in that result set
[04:19:29] <Cork> it doesn't know or care about what parents they have
[04:19:36] <gry> ok
[04:19:39] <Cork> (or children for that matter)
[04:21:50] <Cork> it is basically a for(var i = 0, length=elmSet.length;i < length;i++) { /* check if elmSet[i] matches filter */ }
[04:22:16] <Cork> (this is very simplified though, but in concept that is what it does)
[04:23:59] <gry> thanks, it's a good way to put it and I wouldn't've figured it out easily without your advice
[04:24:34] <Cork> to back it up a little bit
[04:24:37] <AdamPDotty> thats Cork for you
[04:24:53] <Cork> what happens in you're code is: $.parseHTML parses the html into a dom fragment
[04:25:11] <Cork> $() then wraps the outer most elements in that fragments in a jquery object
[04:25:19] <Cork> and puts each element in an internal array
[04:25:33] <Cork> and that is why you get the .filter vs .find situation
[04:25:49] <Cork> *your code*
[04:26:07] <gry> I'm presuming that I'll have to call both .find and .filter and there's no way to make it one thing
[04:26:08] * Cork wonders if he ever will get those right >_<'
[04:26:39] <Cork> gry: parsedData.find('h2').add(parsedData.filter('h2'))
[04:26:40] <AdamPDotty> I could help you out with a trout the're
[04:26:58] <Cork> if i remember correctly
[04:27:14] <Cork> the parsedData should be the variable name where you have wrapped it in $()
[05:23:25] <Utils> I'm trying to use ES6 imports and well, it's not going as planned. https://gist.github.com/JTallis/ffef69af7eb8a5fcecb5177bf4614e33 for whatever reason, $ exists while jQuery does not. I think that's causing bootstrap to error. How can I get this to work? With webpack require I could do: "window.$ = window.jQuery = require('jquery');" and that would work but imports do not.
[06:21:09] <shayla> Hi guys i'm having a problem to trigger an event
[06:21:26] <shayla> I catch the form submit event and then use e.stopPropagation();
[06:21:32] <shayla> Make what i need
[06:21:38] <shayla> And then i trigger submit form event
[06:21:45] <shayla> $('#form_submit').trigger('click');
[06:22:13] <shayla> But i get Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[06:22:31] <shayla> And I don't understand why if i stop the propagation
[06:31:46] <dimi1947> does e.preventdefault() prevent an HTML link from running when clicked?
[06:32:18] <dimi1947> a link with href attribute?that is
[06:34:07] <systemfault> Yes, that's the point.. to prevent the default (Following the link)
[06:39:37] <dimi1947> systemfault:unfortunately in my case it does not work and I cannot understand why
[06:39:52] <dimi1947> I will post some code
[06:39:54] <systemfault> Please.
[06:42:11] <dimi1947> systemfault:give me a minute cause probably I found the cause of it...I will report back
[06:42:17] <systemfault> ok :)
[06:43:48] <AdamPDotty> links do not usually run
[06:44:33] <systemfault> They walk?
[06:44:38] <systemfault> Swim?
[06:44:44] <systemfault> Dance naked?
[06:45:08] <AdamPDotty> Will they lead? I will follow.
[06:45:10] <systemfault> If it doesn't work, is it because the link is unemployed?
[06:50:47] <dimi1947> systemfault:take a look at the code http://hastebin.com/hukunukiwu.js
[06:51:18] <systemfault> You're targeting the <li>, not the link
[06:56:06] <ispyhumanfly> Hey everyone!
[07:08:45] <dimi1947> systemfault:correct...
[07:13:01] <systemfault> dimi1947 All good now?
[07:22:25] <AdamPDotty> it just says link
[07:27:58] <xuscott> hi
[07:35:06] <shayla> Guys i'm having a problem with symfony form. I've got a choices. If I submit a form without any choice seems that doesn't pass anything to post request
[07:39:47] <shayla> sorry wrong channel :(
[08:03:29] <ispyhumanfly> hey everyone
[08:03:51] <wts> hello
[08:04:07] <wts> hello, is there any way to open URL in new window in background using jquery, user should not notice that new window is opened.
[08:10:56] <suexec> I'm using the jQuery-shapeshifter plugin, trying to make my design a little bit more customisable. However, once the shapeshifter stuff kicks in, all my panels are jolted all over the place, instead of being contained inside the parent container. How can I prevent that ?
[08:21:06] <MassDebates> suexec:  would you happen to be able to make a test-case on codepen or jsfiddle? preferrably codepen for full-width and/or full-height display
[08:21:54] <suexec> Will be difficult. This is a bootstrap page where elements are resized according to viewing device etc :(
[08:23:07] <MassDebates> I would suggest you come up with a reduced test-case where others can dig in and see it for themselves.
[08:23:51] <MassDebates> Presentational issues, regardless of whether or not there's any actuation from js/jq, are best solved with sliced-down test-cases that demonstrate the core problem.
[08:24:40] <MassDebates> Just my two cents, but hey, I could be wrong! :P After all, someone might pop in and know exactly what you're talking about from your 44 word question.
[08:25:01] <suexec> Problem is that everything is perfectly positioned up till shapeshift is applied (on dom ready). Then it looks like a bomb blew up in there and everything is spread everywhere
[08:25:26] <suexec> I realize it's hard to help without a test case.. generating a test case is difficult though.
[08:28:04] <MassDebates> I would suggest you analyze the problem and check over your previous attempts to solve it one last time. Determine what's more difficult: Solving it on your own or doing what's necessary to allow someone to solve it for you
[08:29:17] <suexec> Could it be because the parent element doesn't have a fixed height/width, but this is rather calculated by bootstrap on run ?
[08:31:01] <MassDebates> Because your question involves shapeshifter in conjunction with bootstrap, I won't be able to answer your inquiries like this. Either make a test case, stream me video of the problem and let me direct you so I can see for myself, or ask someone else.
[08:37:43] <suexec> This shows my problem I guess: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/twitter-bootstrap-stackoverflow/aTfh_4RzZvw . jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zerolfc/hzftayey/
[08:44:13] <MassDebates> suexec:  are you using jquery 1.9?
[08:44:25] <MassDebates> 1.9.1, for example?
[08:46:13] <suexec> 3.1.1 I think
[08:46:22] <MassDebates> Make a test case that is yours, then.
[08:46:41] <MassDebates> I can't do much with stack overflow questions scraped by google groups and then deleted off of stack overflow.
[08:46:58] <MassDebates> If I wanted to google random examples that may/may not have something to do with your issue directly, I could have found that same link.
[08:47:35] <MassDebates> I wouldn't be surprised if you hear the same thing from anyone else. in fact, if you just went ahead and -did it- you might have had your solution by now
[08:49:12] <MassDebates> Can you not use packery or something similar without success? have you tried?
[08:49:51] <ispyhumanfly> help
[08:49:53] <ispyhumanfly> ahhh
[08:55:01] <dglambert> yo

[10:05:27] <shoky_> adavia: give each row's radio's a different name..
[10:07:08] <adavia> shoky_: but i need an array of values at the end. Perhaps this would be better with checkboxes maybe?
[10:07:46] <shoky_> adavia if you want the user to be able to select one radio in each row, you must give each row different names. that's how radios work. and no, checkboxes wouldn't be better
[10:07:58] <shoky_> and i don't know what array you want, you'll have to explain
[10:14:28] <adavia> shoky_: but is it possible to do that having the same names for each radio?

[10:19:34] <taplar> military time with 'pm', :P
[10:19:47] <Sayona> :))
[10:19:49] <lng> Hi guys! I have a form and I want to submit it via JS according a condition without submit button click. How may I do it?
[10:24:13] <taplar> Sayona: $(this).parent('div').remove(); <-- that is not going up to the div that contains everything.
[10:24:37] <taplar> lng: how do you want it to submit then?
[10:25:06] <lng> taplar: ajax
[10:25:12] <Sayona> let pe to update the js to see
[10:25:59] <taplar> lng: no, i mean what user interaction are you expecting to happen then to cause that to begin?
[10:27:21] <Sayona> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/jcffozfv/1/ , when i add other he clone class y
[10:27:39] <Sayona> taplar, and when I press remove, I want to remove that
[10:28:04] <taplar> yep, so now you are removing too much
[10:28:44] <taplar> when you add a new 'thing', what is the top most element of that thing?
[10:28:45] <Sayona> I want to remove all div inside that clas
[10:28:49] <lng> taplar: well, the logic is this: there's main form and once it is submitted, table is displayed with options to move table elements. The idea is to repeat main form call (the first one) to update a table
[10:29:09] <taplar> 'once it is submitted'
[10:29:16] <taplar> you said you didn't want a submit button
[10:29:19] <Sayona> <div id="Module" class="ModuleInput"> taplar
[10:29:56] <taplar> Sayona: no, you are not appending that when you create a new 'thing'
[10:29:59] <lng> taplar: main form is submitted at first
[10:30:09] <Sayona> (
[10:30:13] <lng> taplar: then some chnages to happen
[10:30:28] <Sayona> :(
[10:30:33] <Sayona> how I fix this?
[10:30:46] <lng> taplar: after all I want to repeat the first form call programmatically
[10:31:01] <taplar> identify what the top element of your new 'things' is
[10:31:05] <lng> taplar: to refresh data
[10:31:29] <taplar> lng: ok, so some how, something is causing an event that you want to stop and proceed with an ajax call, yes?
[10:31:40] <lng> yea
[10:31:45] <lng> something like this
[10:32:47] <taplar> is your question about how to do an ajax call, or about how to get the form data to use for the ajax call, or... ?
[10:32:52] <Alturic1> When using event delegation, can you not us $(this) if the child is a class?
[10:32:54] <lng> taplar: the first form handler is like this: $('.page').on('click', 'button:contains("Show")', function(e) {
[10:33:15] <taplar> Alturic1: yes, 'this' in the handler will be the original element
[10:33:20] <Alturic1> It seems like it changes all of the children when doing $(this).html('foo');
[10:33:29] <Alturic1> ahh
[10:33:33] <lng> taplar: somehow I want to simulate that click
[10:33:56] <taplar> $('.page').trigger('click') can do that
[10:33:58] <Alturic1> Is there anyway to have (I know not proper wording) "this" = the specific element that was clicked?
[10:34:03] <taplar> err
[10:34:23] <taplar> $('.page button:contains("Show")').trigger('click') can do that possibly
[10:34:32] <taplar> though i dislike pseudoselectors usually
[10:34:33] <lng> wow
[10:34:40] <taplar> Alturic1:  it is
[10:34:48] <shoky_> adavia: it might be, but that's not a proper way to use radios and should never be done really .
[10:35:00] <taplar> $(x).on(event, y, handler); in the handler 'this' will be the 'y' that was 'event'ed
[10:35:42] <Alturic1> Ok, so then it's something else.
[10:35:57] <Alturic1> can 'y' be 'a.elements_class' ?
[10:36:01] <lng> taplar: it works! thanks a lot!
[10:36:08] <Alturic1> Or would that cause the issue to where it's updating all of the elements?
[10:36:18] <taplar> awesome
[10:36:38] <taplar> just based off of how 'this' works in that case, i don't see how it would
[10:36:46] <taplar> i'd need to see it happen
[10:36:54] <taplar> brb, need a drink
[10:36:55] <Alturic1> Would it perhaps be because this is inside of a document.ready?
[10:39:23] <taplar> nah
[10:39:47] <taplar> console.log(this) in that handler and see what it is
[10:43:04] <Alturic> Ahh, I think I see what's happening now. If I console.log it right after the .click it returns the correct element. If I put it where I wanted "this" to get updated by, it returns the ajax object it looks like.
[10:43:31] <taplar> so do this
[10:43:31] <taplar> var self = this;
[10:43:42] <taplar> and use 'self' in the other places
[10:43:59] <taplar> so you don't have to worry about the logic changing the scope of 'this'
[10:47:34] <Alturic> Next dumb question, I presume "On" and "Off" have special meanings?
[10:48:01] <taplar> on() is used for binding event handlers to elements.  off is the inverse
[10:48:34] <taplar> if you wanted to make a sentence out of it
[10:49:30] <taplar> for these (elements) on the (event) [of the (children)] do this (logic)
[10:50:00] <taplar> for these (elements) take off the (event) [ with this (logic)]
[10:50:40] <FilipNortic_> .click(function) and .on('click',function()) are more or less the same thing
[10:50:54] <taplar> they are.  click() is a wrapper
[10:54:24] <FilipNortic_> click don't have the optional selector param, but i guess they are definned as separate functions
[10:54:50] <taplar> sure, which is why usually we say to use on() instead of click(), cause it's one step away from being a delegate
[11:32:20] <Sayona> taplar, can you help me :D
[11:33:06] <taplar> you figure out what your top element is that you are inserting?
[11:34:47] <Sayona> with class y?
[11:34:49] <Sayona> div?
[11:35:03] <taplar> yep
[11:35:23] <Sayona>   $(this).parents('.y').remove();
[11:35:25] <Sayona> not work
[11:35:41] <taplar> don't use parents
[11:35:45] <taplar> use closest()
[11:36:19] <codecodecode123> hi, is anyone on?
[11:36:22] <Sayona> i use and not work
[11:36:47] <taplar> Sayona: show me?
[11:36:55] <Sayona> $(this).closest('.y').remove();
[11:37:12] <Sayona> fu... now is working
[11:37:24] <Sayona> :*
[11:37:41] <codecodecode123> im trying to make a range slider with jquery ui,  but its not working even though i linked the theme css and added the jquery ui script. can someone help me?
[11:38:36] <codecodecode123> i can paste code if you need it
[11:49:53] <taplar> codecodecode123: can you make a fiddle?
[12:49:31] * taplar_lunch loves when good ideas go bad
[12:49:42] <robertmaxrees> so all of them?
[12:49:45] <robertmaxrees> BOOM
[12:50:04] <taplar_lunch> pretty much
[12:50:33] <soahc> or if not boom now then boom later
[12:50:37] <taplar_lunch> we have a spinner and overlay that show when our users submit a form or an ajax request
[12:50:45] <taplar_lunch> but they didn't like that for requests that are super fast
[12:50:51] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:50:56] <robertmaxrees> i've had that happen
[12:50:57] <taplar_lunch> so we put in a delay for it so show after about half a second so it wouldn't show up all the time
[12:51:09] <taplar_lunch> but then today we had our issue happen again where some users double click shit
[12:51:10] <taplar_lunch> lol
[12:51:34] <robertmaxrees> ahahahahaha
[12:51:54] <taplar_lunch> so we're putting it back in, making it transparent, and only showing the spinner and darkening the overlay after the delay
[12:52:03] <taplar_lunch> silly users
[12:53:26] <AwkwardCough> its never good enough for them :/
[12:53:30] <robertmaxrees> NBAR
[12:53:36] <robertmaxrees> *NEVAR
[12:54:48] <taplar_lunch> funny story, we also played around with speeding up the spinner.  it gave the illusion that the app was running faster
[12:55:46] <taplar_lunch> and even though i know it's bs, when i go to one of our other apps that still has the slower spinner, i'm immediately like, "crap..." lmao
[14:16:08] <taplar> slooooow
[14:16:12] <robertmaxrees> hella
[15:14:33] <hellyeah> hey
[15:16:06] <taplar> bonjour
[15:21:36] <hellyeah> taplar:  how is it going?
[15:21:47] <hellyeah> i have a question
[15:21:49] <hellyeah> :D
[15:21:58] <taplar> fine.  currently riding my refactor
[15:23:09] <hellyeah> let say i have a several string in an array. Is it logical to do? do for loop and inside for loop do ajax call and data : arr[i]. With that way i will send element of an array as parameter to the backend?
[15:24:02] <taplar> no, you can give an array to an endpoint
[15:24:53] <taplar> you may want to put it to a key, but that's up to you
[15:25:37] <hellyeah> i mean
[15:25:50] <hellyeah> i will give all value to json array like
[15:26:40] <hellyeah> {1:hmm
[15:26:55] <hellyeah> you mean create object with key only
[15:27:05] <taplar> no, don't do that
[15:27:06] <taplar> there's no reason to do that
[15:27:18] <hellyeah> what i thought is
[15:27:26] <taplar> data: { whatevers: array } is enough
[15:27:32] <hellyeah> {1: something, 2: anotherthing}
[15:27:47] <taplar> y?
[15:27:47] <hellyeah> but give index number as key doesnt make much sense right?
[15:28:00] <taplar> you're making a fake array with an object
[15:28:08] <taplar> nope
[15:28:09] <hellyeah> meaning?
[15:28:30] <hellyeah> fke array with object
[15:28:37] <taplar> you are taking an array, and making an object of it
[15:28:38] <hellyeah> so it is array but it seems like object
[15:28:54] <taplar> which really doesn't make sense if your keys are the same as what they would have been in the array
[15:29:06] <taplar> what benifit do you get from it being an object?
[15:29:10] <hellyeah> keys cannot be same in object
[15:29:10] <taplar> *benefit
[15:29:13] <hellyeah> right
[15:29:27] <taplar> they can't be the same in an array either, "|
[15:29:30] <hellyeah> okey let me tell you full story of it
[15:29:31] <taplar> :|
[15:29:48] <hellyeah> i will write an application for server room
[15:30:04] <hellyeah> there are so many cabinet and each cabinet has like 25 computers in it
[15:30:25] <hellyeah> i plan to reach computer with ip and port information
[15:30:31] <hellyeah> i am not sure it is really possible
[15:30:34] <hellyeah> this is my plan
[15:30:52] <hellyeah> for example when you click cabinet button
[15:31:05] <hellyeah> the function in backend will check every computer
[15:31:13] <hellyeah> so that means 25 different ajax call
[15:31:23] <hellyeah> because each machine has its own ip
[15:31:27] <taplar> no
[15:31:30] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[15:31:39] <hellyeah> no?
[15:31:40] <taplar> nope
[15:31:48] <taplar> one ajax call, check them all
[15:31:58] <JonelethIrenicus> my slider works at changing and <output> tag value, but when it is generated via ajax it stops working.  The function still works as I can export the value change from the slider, but the output value never gets updated to be displayed.
[15:32:02] <hellyeah> one ajax call
[15:32:08] <hellyeah> aha
[15:32:09] <taplar> you just described your unit of work
[15:32:16] <hellyeah> send them as array
[15:32:18] <hellyeah> ?
[15:32:21] <taplar> click a button, check all 25, return result
[15:32:21] <taplar> that's one request
[15:32:39] <hellyeah> 25 different result yes
[15:33:02] <taplar> one result
[15:33:11] <taplar> with the result from each server
[15:33:13] <hellyeah> one result as array
[15:33:22] <hellyeah> you mean?
[15:33:30] <hellyeah> ops
[15:33:31] <taplar> sure
[15:33:35] <hellyeah> ah
[15:33:40] <taplar> or an object if each ip is unique
[15:33:47] <hellyeah> so basically you mean send all infos as array to the backend
[15:34:17] <hellyeah> and in the backend function do foreach and do all work
[15:34:18] <taplar> yup
[15:34:28] <hellyeah> that make sense
[15:34:31] <taplar> unless you have some way of categorizing the stations
[15:34:31] <taplar> in which case you could just give it the station id
[15:34:40] <hellyeah> but backend job is heavy i heard rather then frontend
[15:34:47] <hellyeah> tisnt that correct?
[15:35:04] <taplar> you're going to be doing the same work regardless
[15:35:13] <hellyeah> i see
[15:35:21] <taplar> 'heavy' isn't really relative here
[15:36:04] <hellyeah> when you click cabinet button function will get all ips to an array
[15:36:18] <hellyeah> i will need a ddb for it
[15:36:21] <hellyeah> db*
[15:36:36] <taplar> how will you know what ips to get for a cabinet?
[15:36:38] <hellyeah> okey i understand
[15:36:57] <hellyeah> well hmm
[15:37:08] <taplar> how do you identify what a cabinet is?
[15:37:14] <hellyeah> we will have script that connects to computer
[15:37:30] <hellyeah> each cabinet will have that and server runs that script
[15:37:32] <taplar> i'm talking more specifically
[15:37:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:37:51] <taplar> you seem to be saying that you will have some identifier for a cabinet, and using that, you will get the ips associated with it, yes?
[15:38:01] <hellyeah> yea
[15:38:03] <hellyeah> basically
[15:38:17] <taplar> so then for your ip check you don't need to give it the array
[15:38:21] <taplar> just give it the cabinet identifier
[15:38:29] <taplar> let the backend lookup the ips and then do it's business
[15:38:43] <hellyeah> oh
[15:38:56] <hellyeah> actually i draw server room with svg or something
[15:39:05] <hellyeah> i really dont know how to use d3js
[15:39:11] <hellyeah> i may use canvas for that
[15:39:15] <taplar> what does that have to do with this?  lol
[15:39:24] <hellyeah> let me tell
[15:39:33] <hellyeah> i try to put my mind into that
[15:39:48] <hellyeah> each square has its own data which is cabinet name like s1, s2, s3
[15:40:02] <hellyeah> when you click s1 for example i can send s1 to do backend
[15:40:21] <hellyeah> and i will check computes in s1 with the help of database
[15:40:32] <taplar> yup
[15:40:44] <hellyeah> and those lines has ip and port information
[15:41:08] <hellyeah> so that i can work with this in backend and return a datatable with necessary informations
[15:41:15] <hellyeah> and visualize as table in frontend
[15:41:19] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[15:41:51] <taplar> yep, except for your use of 'datetable' in the return
[15:42:12] <hellyeah> i mean json object
[15:42:24] <taplar> then yep
[15:42:26] <hellyeah> i will serialize datatable as json object and return json string
[15:42:39] <hellyeah> c# has something called json netonsoft
[15:42:45] <taplar> lol, what?
[15:42:57] <taplar> what the h* is a datatable?
[15:43:24] <hellyeah> datatable is a structure you store data comes from databbase
[15:43:43] <hellyeah> http://www.newtonsoft.com/
[15:44:36] <hellyeah> https://www.dotnetperls.com/datatable
[15:45:34] <JonelethIrenicus> my slider works at changing and <output> tag value, but when it is generated via ajax it stops working.  The function still works as I can export the value change from the slider, but the output value never gets updated to be displayed.
[15:45:57] <JonelethIrenicus> the slider is using the oninput attribute attached to my function
[15:46:21] <taplar> i don't understand why you wouldn't just use an array of objects, but whatever
[15:46:38] <taplar> sure, so long as it returns json containing the key values that you need
[15:47:03] <JonelethIrenicus> here is an example
[15:47:05] <JonelethIrenicus> http://thenewcode.com/757/Playing-With-The-HTML5-range-Slider-Input
[15:47:05] <hellyeah> c# has that structure for sql
[15:47:15] <JonelethIrenicus> the "show and tell" header is most similar
[15:47:24] <JonelethIrenicus> any ideas?
[15:47:28] <hellyeah> JonelethIrenicus:  i think you should fiddle it
[15:47:38] <hellyeah> taplar is amazing helper
[15:48:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i share something with you btw? I am really sincere about this.
[15:48:34] <taplar> sure?
[15:49:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  i owe you much. You helped me much i try to survive amongst some jerks but i know much better than them and i can think about another projects. Which saves me wasting my time at job
[15:49:30] <hellyeah> i am so grateful to you
[15:49:47] <hellyeah> in a way you saved my life you can find it bit much
[15:51:04] <hellyeah> just nevermind i become kinda emotional :D
[15:51:41] <taplar> wish you weren't in such a position in the first place bro.  but any advice I can give I will.  but I still just consider myself as some random guy in a chat room, :P
[15:52:21] <JonelethIrenicus> hellyeah: did you look at the code?
[15:52:55] <taplar> JonelethIrenicus: we're waiting for a fiddle showing your issue
[15:53:48] <hellyeah> taplar:  it is just your genorocity
[15:54:01] <hellyeah> hope no typos here
[15:54:13] <hellyeah> JonelethIrenicus:  i am not expert but taplar is
[15:54:31] <hellyeah> preparing jsfiddle is preffered
[15:54:48] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: you want me to create a fiddle with an ajax call so you can see the issue?
[15:55:04] <taplar> yep
[15:55:23] <hellyeah> you can create ajax call in jsfiddle
[15:55:30] <JonelethIrenicus> seems excessive im sure this is a common issue
[15:55:49] <taplar> your asking for help.  help us help you
[15:56:14] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: did you look at the link I provided?
[15:56:24] <hellyeah> JonelethIrenicus:  http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[15:56:26] <taplar> we are entirely here by our own choice.  most of us have work we are also working on and can't spend much time on other things.
[15:56:42] <JonelethIrenicus> it is a very simple concept
[15:56:54] <JonelethIrenicus> i think it is just a DOM issue
[15:56:55] <taplar> looks like a page about using those sliders
[15:57:03] <taplar> doesn't show your issue
[15:57:08] <JonelethIrenicus> "show and tell" slider is almost exact my issue
[15:57:15] <JonelethIrenicus> that is my function code
[15:57:20] <taplar> if you don't want to put together a fiddle to demonstrate your issue, then good luck
[15:57:24] <JonelethIrenicus> but the HTML is generated via ajax
[15:57:58] <JonelethIrenicus> how can i update my slider input value display when it isn't created at page creation?
[15:58:21] <JonelethIrenicus> <input slider> <output>123</output>
[15:58:24] <hellyeah> well you can create template string and show that when you do ajax call
[15:58:35] <hellyeah> there is htmlparse method or something
[15:58:41] <hellyeah> of course taplar will know better
[15:59:16] <JonelethIrenicus> normally with jquery you can just select those elements using document
[15:59:17] <taplar> heh, hellyeah please don't phrase it like that.  i'm just a dude
[15:59:33] <hellyeah> no
[15:59:37] <taplar> sure, but you can only select things that currently exist in the document
[15:59:38] <hellyeah> jquery yo use $
[15:59:46] <hellyeah> taplar:  okey i wont do it next time
[16:00:06] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: yeah but if something is generated via ajax you need to change the selector methods
[16:00:11] <taplar> but that show and tell example isn't using jquery at all
[16:00:29] <JonelethIrenicus> no it isn't
[16:00:40] <taplar> if the selector is ran after the elements are generated, then no.  it doesn't have to change
[16:00:54] <hellyeah> i need to sleep
[16:00:57] <hellyeah> good night
[16:01:26] <taplar> but again, this could be different issue depending upon your implementation, so a fiddle would really be helpful
[16:01:30] <hellyeah> JonelethIrenicus:  in my experience
[16:01:41] <hellyeah> if html will be generated after some event
[16:01:46] <hellyeah> you can use template string
[16:01:58] <hellyeah> and use htmlparse method after particular event
[16:02:01] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: but the only code that is being used is displayed on that page
[16:02:08] <JonelethIrenicus> it works for non-ajax generated content
[16:02:19] <JonelethIrenicus> it is literally just not working with ajax generated data
[16:04:06] <JonelethIrenicus> function still gets triggered and the value is updated on the <input> but not the <output>
[16:04:37] <hellyeah> JonelethIrenicus:   you should find a way to show your code on fiddle
[16:07:03] <JonelethIrenicus> hellyeah: i showed my code
[16:07:38] <taplar> where?
[16:13:44] <JonelethIrenicus> http://thenewcode.com/757/Playing-With-The-HTML5-range-Slider-Input
[16:13:54] <JonelethIrenicus> that is literally the exact same code
[16:14:23] <taplar> except for the ajax
[16:14:23] <taplar> so not exact
[16:14:31] <taplar> so it's not your code
[16:14:34] <JonelethIrenicus> the ajax means nothing
[16:14:35] <taplar> :|
[16:14:49] <JonelethIrenicus> it is the same HTML put into the page dynamically
[16:14:52] <taplar> oh it does apparently cause you say it's not working
[16:15:01] <taplar> good luck man
[16:17:07] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: yeah good luck to you as well
[16:22:20] <Sayona> Hi all :)
[16:22:33] <taplar> getting late for you isn't it? ;)
[16:22:55] <Sayona> me?
[16:23:13] <taplar> yep, heh, didn't you say it was 17:00 earlier?
[16:23:18] <Sayona> 23:23 here
[16:23:45] <Sayona> But when you have a hobby ! the time is not a problem!
[16:23:56] <Sayona> Only my boyfriend it is... becouse I don't have time for him...
[16:26:49] <Sayona> :*
[17:33:50] <taplar> Sayona: i hear ya, my boyfriend is mad at me right now too
[17:34:10] <taplar> thinks i like women for some reason
[17:36:42] <taplar> awkwardnes....Achieved
[17:37:50] <drej> wat
[17:38:17] <taplar> hmm?
[17:38:26] <drej> there are many reasons for that
[17:38:54] <taplar> lol
[17:39:03] <taplar> slam
[19:10:42] <catbadger> Hi guys
[19:10:50] <catbadger> I'm having IE11 troubles.
[19:11:08] <robertmaxrees> maybe we can help!
[19:11:19] <catbadger> I certainly hope so robert. it seems to be ignoring the ?v=x arguments we're adding to javascript
[19:11:29] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:11:58] <catbadger> so not all of our scripts load the newest versions when we roll out an update. It causes millions of error emails to be generated.
[19:12:10] <robertmaxrees> ah, cachebusting you mean.
[19:12:13] <catbadger> driving me bonkers as you can't force clear cache
[19:12:52] <robertmaxrees> so how are you setting the cachebust?
[19:13:06] <catbadger> oops
[19:13:10] <catbadger> sorry was closing tabs
[19:13:11] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:13:13] <catbadger> I'm at work
[19:13:13] <robertmaxrees> so how are you setting the cachebust?
[19:13:54] <catbadger> I don't know as that portion of the codebase is not mine and I've not seen it. AFAIK, php is setting datelastmodified
[19:14:04] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[19:14:12] <robertmaxrees> so this isn't a jquery problem.
[19:14:21] <catbadger> is there not a pure jquery way to do it?
[19:14:29] <robertmaxrees> cachebust files?
[19:14:44] <catbadger> yeah. I was hoping i was just missing something easy
[19:14:46] <robertmaxrees> your JS shouldn't be involved in that for your base js files.
[19:14:47] <catbadger> haa
[19:14:51] <hellyeah> hey
[19:14:52] <robertmaxrees> unless this is for ajax calls.
[19:14:56] <catbadger> no
[19:15:06] <catbadger> well sort of. everything is loaded via requirejs
[19:15:18] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a server misconfiguration.
[19:15:29] <catbadger> only affects IE11
[19:15:36] <catbadger> it's an IE11 problem
[19:15:39] <catbadger> ;)
[19:15:39] <robertmaxrees> or an RJS misconfiguration.
[19:15:43] <catbadger> ooh
[19:15:51] * catbadger didn't think to check there
[19:16:03] <robertmaxrees> actually, IE11 (and prior versions) are very VERY good at following the caching spec.
[19:16:06] <catbadger> the js is mine. I'll get on the boss about it and try to learn more.
[19:16:07] <robertmaxrees> make sure things are config'd right.
[19:16:20] <robertmaxrees> either way, good luck :)
[19:16:22] <catbadger> ok. thanks as always for your insight robert.
[19:16:26] <catbadger> :)
[19:16:45] <catbadger> I'm not allowed to spend much time on irc. gtg. thanks again
[20:23:56] <TWG> Is there any way to do require's like in SASS with javascript/jquery?
[21:22:50] <bjsnider> how do i target a specific button? they have no classes or ids, but they do have names
[21:23:08] <bjsnider> do i use the parent?
[21:24:01] <robertmaxrees> you traditionally target through another element that does.
[21:24:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid selecting on the name if you can.
[21:24:18] <bjsnider> that didn't work anyway
[21:24:33] <robertmaxrees> what didn't?
[21:24:37] <robertmaxrees> selecting on the name?
[21:24:46] <bjsnider> yeah
[21:24:53] <robertmaxrees> you can totally select on names.
[21:24:59] <robertmaxrees> i just suggest people avoid it :)
[21:25:11] <bjsnider> works if i just use 'button'
[21:25:15] <robertmaxrees> right.
[21:25:19] <robertmaxrees> that's the element type.
[21:25:25] <robertmaxrees> how were you selecting on name?
[21:25:49] <bjsnider> i tried hte name by itself, and button.name
[21:25:59] <robertmaxrees> the . is for classes.
[21:26:03] <robertmaxrees> not for other attributes.
[21:26:16] <bjsnider> i was grasping at straws
[21:26:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  just select through a parent.
[21:26:44] <robertmaxrees> though for the record you're looking for an attribute selector.
[21:27:21] <bjsnider> i would obviously use an id or class with a very specific name
[21:27:30] <robertmaxrees> sure when appropraite.
[21:27:52] <m1911> yeah
[21:27:53] <robertmaxrees> though normally you don't worry about buttons themselves sooo.
[21:29:06] <bjsnider> i have to worry about it because i need a nonstandard reset to defaults button
[21:29:51] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[21:31:55] <bjsnider> i guess it's not an accident that jquery's selection method looks exactly the same as css?
[21:32:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[21:32:14] <robertmaxrees> sizzle uses css + some extras.
[21:32:31] <robertmaxrees> oftentimes it just passes through to document.querySelectorAll under the hood.
[21:33:34] <bjsnider> makes it easier for dummies like me to figure out the syntax that will work
[21:33:56] <robertmaxrees> hah.  more like css selectors are pretty easy to understand so why not go that route?
[21:34:07] <robertmaxrees> the api docs and learning center are creat resources, too.
[22:02:26] <babalx> Hi all
[22:02:40] <babalx> I have an API for which I'm considering allowing access for clients from browser-based JS. This would involve potentially allowing CORS from all domains (Access-Control-Allow-Origin *). Authentication is always required to use the API and is not cookie based. Any reason this would be a bad idea?
[22:04:00] <arc_> as long as you set it up properly, know what data you are serving on that domain/subdomain, and none of it is sensitive data, no, that's the point of being able to allow cross site scripting
[22:08:14] <babalx> Just was asking in case there were some less known exploits. All exposed API calls require authentication by passing a proper auth key/token with the request (so no cookies) and as such the only issue I see is potential DOS attacks but that's possible outside of this as well so not as concerned there
[22:22:51] <bjsnider> if i try to select something that has square braces in the id, it doesn't work
[22:23:21] <robertmaxrees> you have to escape them.
[22:23:29] <bjsnider> how?
[22:23:57] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/
[22:25:14] <bjsnider> fiddle is a bit deceptive by not using a colour scheme to tell me that i need to do this
[22:25:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:25:25] <robertmaxrees> to escape?
[22:25:33] <robertmaxrees> it's because you're in the middle of a string.
[22:25:41] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to look any further than that.
[22:25:52] <arc_> not really sure how it can highlight something that's optional
[22:26:09] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[22:35:27] <bjsnider> i thighlights bad html aggressively
[22:35:43] <robertmaxrees> that's html.
[22:35:48] <robertmaxrees> totally different.
[22:36:14] <bjsnider> it doesn't show me i've got the wrong closing braces unless i select them
[22:37:33] <robertmaxrees> pretty normal for most IDEs
[22:37:35] <arc_> it can't know if you have wrong braces. it just shows you what that brace is closing. you have to interpret whether it's wrong or not
[22:37:58] <bjsnider> if i type in some jquery and i'm not using that lib, it doesn't tell me to switch the settings
[22:38:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:38:09] <arc_> : /
[22:38:21] <robertmaxrees> because it doesn't know what the window object may or may not provide.
[22:38:50] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need a more full-blown IDE.
[22:38:55] <robertmaxrees> or editor in general.
[22:39:10] <bjsnider> if i start the statement with jQuery, it doesn't know i want to use jquery?
[22:39:23] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to check for you.
[22:39:26] <whimsicle> what editor are we talking about?
[22:39:40] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle isn't going to do a bunch of extra effort like that.
[22:39:56] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) if you want something that'll be more fully featured, check out any of the available editors.
[22:40:48] <arc_> it's not meant to be used as your main development environment
[22:40:52] <arc_> it's just a sketchbook
[22:40:52] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
