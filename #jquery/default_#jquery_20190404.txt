[04:39:38] <scetian> Hi i need some help with google maps. Its showing a blank screen
[04:39:41] <scetian> any ideas please?
[04:57:01] <soxfoxrox> Hello. I have a script that displays some hidden form options when the user selects an option in the drop down. When form validation fails (not in the select, elsewhere), the form displays an error, the selected option is still selected, but the hidden form fields disappear. How can I change my script so instead of just monitoring 'change', it monitors whether the fields are selected? Here's
[04:57:01] <soxfoxrox> the javascript, let me know if you also need to see the html: https://jsbin.com/hubeyebune/edit?js,output
[05:00:01] <thykka> soxfoxrox, why do they disappear?
[05:00:26] <thykka> and yes, attaching a functioning test case is far more useful than a bunch of disconnected javascript
[05:02:00] <soxfoxrox> thykka, I guess they disappear because the page is reloaded to display the form error. I am using Django and am not completely sure how its form validation works.
[05:02:21] <thykka> right, so run the function on page load as well?
[05:03:20] <soxfoxrox> thykka, that's exactly what I'd like to add to the function. I will try to find a solution.
[05:03:45] <thykka> you don't add it to the function, you add the function to the page load event :)
[05:04:37] <thykka> it would be beneficial to not use an anonymous function here, so you can re-use the same function for both events
[05:06:05] <thykka> also, i'm sure there's a more elegant way of hiding and showing those fields, than an if-clause for every possible choice
[05:06:30] <thykka> work smart, not hard
[05:08:51] <soxfoxrox> thykka, thanks. I'm at level zero with javascript and probably level 1 or 2 with python and django, and so far I have not invested any/enough time in learning javascript.
[05:09:33] <soxfoxrox> thykka, is this the kind of function I will need to implement: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/ ?
[05:09:54] <thykka> yes, that should do
[05:12:28] <soxfoxrox> thykka, so I need to have two functions, one for when the document is ready, and one for the select change event - and both of these functions should execute my clumsy if-clauses?
[05:13:00] <thykka> ideally you don't want to repeat yourself, so you make both events call the same function
[05:13:54] <soxfoxrox> thanks.
[05:23:02] <thykka> soxfoxrox, here, I refactored it for you https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/nqakbw5p/
[05:23:10] <thykka> see if that makes things a bit more manageable
[05:27:21] <soxfoxrox> thykka, thanks, I got this far before returning to irc: https://jsbin.com/somatovini/edit?js,output
[05:27:40] <soxfoxrox> the change function worked but not the ready one.
[05:28:40] <thykka> soxfoxrox, in your ready function, you're passing the entire select element as the parameter, rather than it's 'value'
[05:31:58] <soxfoxrox> thykka, am I right that the code you posted doesn't hide again if the user selects something else?
[05:32:28] <thykka> no, it will run the function every time the <select> value is changed
[05:32:48] <thykka> why do you ask?
[05:33:17] <soxfoxrox> I am trying to implement it :)
[05:33:42] <soxfoxrox> thykka, I see the fiddle works, though.
[05:34:56] <soxfoxrox> thykka, it's probably because my documents initial state is that some of the fields are hidden
[05:35:47] <thykka> hmm, you might be onto something there..
[05:35:52] <thykka> just a moment
[05:37:27] <thykka> yes, I had made a stupid mistake or two
[05:37:46] <thykka> soxfoxrox, this should work correctly on page load as well https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/nqakbw5p/17/
[05:43:42] <thykka> soxfoxrox, I made it even more concise https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/nqakbw5p/22/
[05:44:07] <thykka> this way it should also be easier to use a database as the data source
[05:45:53] <soxfoxrox> thykka, many, many thanks for your time. Can I ask one last favour? How to exclude form elements whose initial state is visible from the script, or alternatively declare in the script which elements should always be visible? Right now the script hides my submit button and some other fields which should always be visible. The initial state of my document is that fields that should be shown in
[05:45:54] <soxfoxrox> some cases are hidden, while fields that should always be shown are shown.
[05:47:08] <thykka> soxfoxrox, in my hideAllInputs I'm using "input" as the selector, and this will apply to any and all <input> elements. An alternative would be to provide a selector that only applies to the inputs you wish to hide
[05:48:19] <soxfoxrox> is the notationf or that $('input#value1, input#value2') and so on?
[05:48:57] <thykka> soxfoxrox, right. But since our solution now has a list of all the elements that CAN be hidden, we could re-uses that list to only hide elements it contains; https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/nqakbw5p/25/
[05:55:42] <soxfoxrox> thykka, thank you very, very much for your time.
[05:55:46] <soxfoxrox> Very nice of you.
[05:55:52] <thykka> np!
[11:19:36] <MikeD_> is it legal to put an additional property on a $.Deferred() object?
[11:59:55] <MikeD_> hmm... seems to work ok
[12:12:26] <z1haze> are there any negative effects of wrapping a jquery object in a jquery object?
[12:12:35] <robertmaxrees> you can't :)
[12:12:51] <z1haze> does jq just handle that for you then?
[12:13:15] <robertmaxrees> it usually checks and skips running the constructor.
[12:13:20] <z1haze> eg having a function that takes a selector, or a jquery object.. and in the function to var $container = $(container); where container is passed into the function, etc
[12:13:27] <z1haze> jq is smart enough to work with that?
[12:13:55] <z1haze> 'usually' worries me
[12:14:09] <robertmaxrees> it'll do that for you, but i'd avoid a function like that.
[12:14:28] <robertmaxrees> type juggling is a bad idea.
[12:14:54] <z1haze> yeah, agreed but i think this in particular isnt so bad
[12:15:16] <z1haze> plus i didnt write it, just reviewing it :D
[12:16:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:16:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd reject that tbh.
[12:16:31] <z1haze> haha
[12:16:38] <z1haze> nothing would ever get done man
[12:16:39] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i'm serious.
[12:16:47] <z1haze> i know you are
[12:16:51] <robertmaxrees> then what's the point of the code review?
[12:16:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:17:12] <z1haze> well, im not working with the cream of the crop here man
[12:17:26] <z1haze> if it works and wont break i kinda have to accept it
[12:17:28] <robertmaxrees> cr is a great change to help people improve.
[12:17:29] <z1haze> otherwise id lose my job
[12:17:32] <robertmaxrees> *chance
[12:17:58] <z1haze> ive been given 'the talk' countless times about 'choose your battles'
[12:18:10] <z1haze> maybe im becoming jaded
[12:18:10] <robertmaxrees> a rejection is considered a battle??
[12:18:27] <z1haze> yeah, i mean if the business says 'this project needs to go live'
[12:18:39] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:18:43] <z1haze> and it doesnt.. they ask me why i said.. well their code wasnt how i wanted it to be. then they ask.. 'did it work'?
[12:18:44] <robertmaxrees> that's a toxic environment
[12:18:50] <z1haze> its gotten better.
[12:18:54] <z1haze> i have hope
[12:19:20] <robertmaxrees> rejections shouldn't ever be blamed for a missed go-live.
[12:20:03] <z1haze> i dont think you get the situation
[12:20:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:20:33] <z1haze> have you ever worked with.. less than ideal developers, or even offshore teams
[12:20:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:20:43] <robertmaxrees> i have
[12:20:43] <z1haze> so you should get it
[12:20:55] <z1haze> id be here all my life trying to get one project finished if i didnt compromise
[12:21:04] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[12:21:14] <robertmaxrees> i disagree, but your choice :)
[12:21:35] <z1haze> i wish i had that ability
[12:21:45] <z1haze> like i said, its gotten a lot better
[12:45:55] <z1haze> so on jquery 3.x $.ajax calls return native promises?
[12:46:25] <robertmaxrees> ajax has returned promises for quite a while.
[12:46:42] <z1haze> we were on 2.2.4 until not too long ago, it did not
[12:46:57] <z1haze> or maybe it was 2.2.1 i dont remember
[12:46:59] <z1haze> it was pretty old though
[12:47:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/03cj24s1/
[12:47:24] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:48:04] <z1haze> that's not a real promise though right?
[12:48:12] <z1haze> thats a jquery deferred
[12:48:19] <robertmaxrees> which are promises.
[12:48:30] <z1haze> hmm
[12:48:40] <z1haze> i remember a time you couldnt .then an ajax call
[12:48:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that was a long time ago.
[12:48:50] <z1haze> haha
[12:48:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:48:54] <z1haze> thanks
[13:23:00] <d45nny> imagesLoaded when done for "one particular" div is waiting for all the images in the page to be loaded, is there a way to detect when all the images in ONE particular div has loaded, this is basically for the page loader.
[13:24:10] <d45nny> So basically when I do this > jQuery('.layer-holder').imagesLoaded( function(), it only fires after all the images in the page has loaded
[13:24:38] <d45nny> Tried some codes from stackoverflow too
[13:51:15] <Biganon> Hi there ; so I have this simple code : https://jsfiddle.net/n4o1cwvk/ , as you can see I'm trying to use a custom _renderItem() on an autocomplete widget with jQuery UI. It works great, BUT, the <span> element you see in my example (or an <img> element...) automatically receives an id and a class I do not think I want (because it does weird things with the CSS.. basically when I hover over the <li>, the span
[13:51:16] <Biganon> gets a little border ! Only the span, on the side of the <li>...)
[13:51:59] <Biganon> is there something I understand wrong ? Should I have like.. a div directly in each <li>, and this div would receive this id and class (the id is a numbered id, the class is ui-menu-item-wrapper) ?
[13:52:38] <Biganon> because the API guide does not indicate the need to do this, so I don't understand why it's not the <li> receiving an individual id, and being themed on hover, etc.
[13:53:24] <robertmaxrees> are you able to get your fiddle functional?
[13:54:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pg7osyd1/2/
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> does this show the bug?
[13:55:40] <shoky> d45nny: according to that library's code, and a simple test, it does what you want - only waits for images in the element(s) you ran it on.  maybe you have multiple .layer-holder's
[14:18:57] <shoky> Biganon: yes jquery-ui adds that class to children of the <li> menu item. mentioned here http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/#theming
[14:57:58] <Biganon> thanks a lot shoky! good to know
[14:58:15] <Biganon> that's probably why my images, on the left of each <li>, get surrounded by a border, on hover.
[15:18:55] <fkl> for some reason jQuery.get is missing
[15:19:19] <fkl> I am using 3.3.1.slim.min.js
[15:20:56] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[15:21:03] <robertmaxrees> you're using the slim build :)
[15:21:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jquery.com/download/#jquery -> "You can also use the slim build, which excludes the ajax and effects modules:"
[15:23:12] <robertmaxrees> fkl ^
[16:23:30] <cek> I'm trying to get access to data param inside a $.ajax().done handler.
[16:25:24] <cek> and i'm failing. Assuming I no longer have access to original request
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> cek got a fiddle?
[16:29:52] <cek> https://jsfiddle.net/9xz4sjeh/
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:30:14] <robertmaxrees> mind putting that in normal js?
[16:30:41] <cek> nope
[16:30:49] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:33:35] <cek> it seems data is deleted from jqxhr on purpose after a failed request
[16:33:54] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: not even sure what you're trying to do :)
[16:34:16] <cek> get access to data object on jqxhr
[16:34:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:34:44] <robertmaxrees> you already said that - can you show me normal js of what you're trying to accomplish
[16:34:45] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:43:16] <Biganon> shoky: but in my case, where there is an image and a text in each <li>, what would you suggest ? Putting all that in a div, and let this div receive the ui-menu-item-wrapper class ?
[16:48:20] <luist> hey, how do i remove a listener like: $(‘.c-element’).on('click', …)
[16:48:39] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/off/ luist
[17:49:37] <shoky> Biganon: yes. and you can style ui-menu-item-wrapper in your own css if you want to change it
[17:51:45] <Biganon> nice. Thank you.
[17:57:17] <luist> how can i delay this by 400ms: $('.c-component').addClass('c-myclass');
[17:57:43] <robertmaxrees> did you try searching google luist?
[18:02:43] <luist> robertmaxrees: yes, but there any many different opinions and i want to know the best practice
[18:03:05] <robertmaxrees> there are two: use delay with queue or just use settimeout
[19:04:50] <QzMicro> Hi guys.  Looking for some assistance.  I have a script that dynamically sets a second drop down list, based on the first drop down list's selection.  I have it working but can't seem to figure out how to listen for a selection on the second drop down list and trigger page change (iframe in this case.)  Anyone have any resources I might be able to look at.  I sure would appreciate it.  Thanks.
[19:07:23] <pavonia> The same way as for the first list, I would guess
[19:11:25] <QzMicro> Sadly, you just pointed me in the right direction.  I got my test script working now.  I had my placement for the second dropdown list out of place.  xP   Thanks.
