[05:50:52] <devi8> What's the easiest way to determine if any siblings exists with a jquery collection?
[06:28:36] <Suepaphly> Hello, anyone active?
[06:28:46] <Suepaphly> Having some trouble with a jquery script
[06:28:52] <Suepaphly> wanted some advice
[06:29:32] <devi8> ask away
[06:31:18] <Suepaphly> legit
[06:31:25] <Sandlayth> Don't ask to ask, if anybody is here or alive or if anybody uses or knows something. Just ask.
[06:31:31] <Suepaphly> ya ya
[06:31:50] <Suepaphly> I have this bit of Jquery code which links up to some div classes and html buttons
[06:32:06] <Suepaphly> however, I have another bit of jquery code that uploads a photo then displays it on the page
[06:32:41] <Suepaphly> I need this first bit to be called after the upload so that Jcrop (what i'm trying to implement) properly selects the image element
[06:32:48] <Suepaphly> I will make some pastie's brb
[06:32:54] <Woet> do jsfiddle instead
[06:36:40] <Suepaphly> ok
[06:36:49] <Suepaphly> well idk if i can do jsfiddle with this
[06:38:35] <Suepaphly> ok -> jquery
[06:38:38] <Suepaphly> https://pastebin.com/iC1avZ83
[06:38:52] <Suepaphly> other code -> https://pastebin.com/1Vtu6XBa
[06:40:03] <Suepaphly> i can't figure out if it's not displaying correctly, or if it's not affecting the image because it is making the reference before the image is uploaded
[06:40:11] <Suepaphly> sorry, I'm a noob at Jquery just trying to sort it out
[06:52:52] <devi8> it appears that you are doing something with a jcrop plugin and wordpress?
[07:09:33] <Suepaphly> @devi8 bingo
[07:10:01] <Suepaphly> specifically I'm trying to use jcrop after an image has already been uploaded and inserted into the page as an html preview
[07:10:15] <Suepaphly> you can check it out here (see pm)
[07:14:00] <devi8> do you know how to use the developer tools in Chrome?
[07:14:53] <devi8> Right click on your page and select the "inspect item" option (or something like that) to open devtools. then look at the "console" tab--it clearly outlines the errors so far.
[07:15:25] <Suepaphly> ah yes, silly me
[07:15:31] <Suepaphly> thank you
[07:32:02] <devi8> Suepaphly, you would probably want to hook into the Customizer scripts  to insert images and preview them before posting them. Otherwise you have to rebuild some pretty intense code to make it happy.
[07:33:57] <Suepaphly> so i didn't put the ./ before loading the scripts
[07:34:07] <Suepaphly> so that's why it wasn't loading a couple of them
[07:34:36] <Suepaphly> before posting? hmm
[07:34:50] <Suepaphly> I wanted to capture the original too though
[07:35:15] <Suepaphly> storing it on the client side seems risky too
[07:35:43] <Suepaphly> just in case there's any issue I can send it back and be like, "hey is this right?"
[07:35:49] <Suepaphly> I haven't even written the e-mail scripts yet
[07:41:53] <Suepaphly> devi8 idk what you mean by customizer scripts
[08:05:32] <thykka> Â´`D https://i.redd.it/zq4bm9kdplg01.png
[08:05:51] <devi8> Are you trying to create a form that lets customers upload images to your server (for you to use) or are you trying to make it so customers can upload images to contribute posts to your site?
[08:08:47] <Suepaphly> upload images to my server mostly, but the customer needs to proof it first
[08:09:06] <Suepaphly> it doesn't matter to me if it is not private, garbage collection will handle it
[08:09:29] <Suepaphly> i'm getting a net:: ERR_ABORTED message
[08:09:39] <devi8> so you want the images added to your wp db?
[08:09:42] <Suepaphly> I think it's because it's trying to reference the image before it is loaded
[08:09:52] <Suepaphly> yeah i do, but that functionality has already been done
[08:09:58] <Suepaphly> the issue is integrating jcrop
[08:10:48] <Suepaphly> so the add-to-cart-form isn't shown until the image is uploaded, but I think the script below the image-upload jquery scripty (the jcrop jquery script) is tryin gto reference the image, giving me this error
[08:14:15] <devi8> in the script on line 31, I think, in your success handler, you say "getImgSizes(img)...but img is not defined there
[08:15:11] <Suepaphly> it is defined elsewhere
[08:15:15] <devi8> you need to find the image in the html returned to success, it looks like. Does the ajax handler return html on success?
[08:15:30] <Suepaphly> no
[08:15:37] <devi8> in the ajax handler type: console.log(img);
[08:17:22] <Suepaphly> ok
[08:17:27] <Suepaphly> nothing in the console here
[08:20:58] <devi8> so on line 25, you have an ajax success handler that fires an another ajax call?
[08:22:01] <Suepaphly> yes
[08:22:20] <Suepaphly> i believe that's after the image has been uploaded, then it proceeds to display
[08:22:26] <Suepaphly> I'm not sure though, I didn't write that portion
[08:24:48] <devi8> the initial upload of the image is the first ajax call, that will load the image into a container and fire the sucess handler when done...
[08:25:09] <devi8> then from the success handler you can preview the image and ask if it's okay to upload for real.
[08:25:46] <devi8> if they approve, then you create a new WP Post with the image attachment to add it to wordpress...I think using ajax
[08:26:10] <Suepaphly> bingo
[08:26:31] <Suepaphly> yes, that portion is already done
[08:26:49] <Suepaphly> I'm just trying to insert Jcrop before the last step
[08:27:20] <Suepaphly> idk where to put the jquery, and I believe the errors I'm getting are from it trying to reference the image while it hasn't been loaded yet
[08:27:30] <Suepaphly> can I do like a simple logic switch like
[08:27:31] <devi8> I don't see how that works. Sorry, I'm not getting it. It just looks like you immediately upload the image after adding it to the page....if you want to do stuff before that, put it berfore the second ajax in the success handler of the first ajax
[08:27:47] <Suepaphly> if(image has loaded) then { run jquery functions }
[08:28:05] <devi8> That's why you have the success handler.
[08:28:11] <Suepaphly> ah ok
[08:28:12] <devi8> it runs once the image is loaded
[08:28:17] <Suepaphly> i'm not very familiar with jquery/ajax
[08:28:19] <devi8> otherwise it doesn't run
[08:28:20] <Suepaphly> ok
[08:28:35] <Suepaphly> so how would i stop the jcrop portion for firing early?
[08:29:03] <devi8> ajax does things asynchronously...so you can do other stuff why it's loading and then when it's done, it will automatically call the function you supplied in your success property for the ajax call
[08:29:31] <devi8> put it in the success handler....it won't run until the image has successfully been added to the page that way
[08:29:44] <Suepaphly> so line 135 where i call #target is cool? even though #target isn't loaded?
[08:30:08] <Suepaphly> or would I move that to the success handler?
[08:30:52] <devi8> line 27...insert a lot of stuff before that
[08:31:24] <devi8> I'm not sure what the action properties are doing.
[08:31:46] <Suepaphly> so like lines 128-149?
[08:32:35] <devi8> gimme just a minute...
[08:32:43] <Suepaphly> probably irrelevant to what i'm doing, sure man I appreciate the help
[08:37:10] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/zeo3f9dL/4/
[08:37:31] <devi8> I added some comments. It's not working code, but it explains what I think you wan to happen.
[08:38:44] <devi8> create the initial ajax request when the input field changes. It adds the image to the page. Then you use the .done() handler on the first ajax request to setup your cropping and confirmation form. When confirmed, you call a second ajax to add it to your database.
[08:40:02] <Suepaphly> hmm ok well thanks a lot I will review this
[08:40:42] <devi8> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:41:25] <devi8> notice the deprecation notice that says not to use success, error and complete, but rather use .done, .fail and .always
[08:41:37] <Suepaphly> nice!
[08:42:07] <Suepaphly> thanks man so essentially by doing this I will be able to use .done, .fail, and .always instead of success handlers
[08:42:20] <devi8> yes
[08:42:56] <devi8> and see how they did it in the example...they created the request object, and chained the hanlders after it
[08:43:53] <Suepaphly> i'm sorry where?
[08:44:00] <devi8> The only tricky part for your situation is remembering that the first loads to the page (and disappears if the page is reloaded or changed...the second ajax request actually adds it to your database for future refrenece...you can do anything you want in between them
[08:44:20] <devi8> they said: var something=$.ajkax("example.php
[08:44:26] <devi8> "then .done
[08:44:28] <Suepaphly> all the way at the bottom
[08:44:29] <devi8> then .fail
[08:44:46] <Suepaphly> var xmlRequest = $.ajax({   url: "page.php",   processData: false,   data: xmlDocument });   xmlRequest.done( handleResponse );
[08:45:19] <devi8> sort of. I was looking at the part right under the deprecation notice.
[08:46:20] <devi8> var something =$.ajax(url).done(donehandler).fail(failhandler).always(alwayshandler);
[08:46:39] <Suepaphly> ah ok
[08:47:23] <devi8> so yours would look like var initialupload=$.ajax(urlfrominputfield).done(cropandapproveimage);
[08:47:24] <Suepaphly> oh great i was worried it didn't
[08:47:43] <Suepaphly> i though it uploaded first but that's good news
[08:47:49] <Suepaphly> got it
[08:47:54] <Suepaphly> I think i can whip this together now
[08:48:01] <Suepaphly> great help there sir
[08:48:05] <Suepaphly> you do this channel proud
[08:48:38] <devi8> that's sweet. Maybe not entirely accurate, but sweet none the less.
[08:50:34] <devi8> you can also create a new image object (without a src attribute). Attach handlers to it's load event and then just change it's src attribute to the url provided in the input field.
